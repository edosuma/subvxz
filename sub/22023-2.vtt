D-Did Brett like Radiohead?

00:25.329 --> 00:27.995
No, it's just the only song she knows.

00:27.996 --> 00:32.445
- Her YouTube channel is so sad.

00:37.557 --> 00:40.787
Thank you, Sandra. That was... lovely.

00:42.290 --> 00:46.092
We're gathered here today
to honor our dear friend

00:46.161 --> 00:49.062
and co-worker Brett Kobashigawa.

00:49.130 --> 00:52.533
He died doing what he loved
most... collecting carts.

00:52.534 --> 00:54.500
We do not know he's dead!

00:54.569 --> 00:56.369
- Glenn.
- They did not find a body.

00:56.438 --> 00:57.489
They found a foot.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.272
Maybe it's somebody else's foot.

00:59.340 --> 01:02.075
All we know is that
Brett was in the parking lot

01:02.143 --> 01:04.709
collecting carts when the tornado hit.

01:04.779 --> 01:07.346
And that no one has seen
or heard from him since.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.682
- And the foot...
- Stop with the foot.

01:09.751 --> 01:12.452
- We have addressed the foot.
- I agree with Glenn.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.120
Brett wasn't killed by that tornado.

01:14.189 --> 01:15.621
Thank you, Dina.

01:15.690 --> 01:17.457
What usually happens is
all the air is sucked

01:17.525 --> 01:19.158
from your lungs and then they
fill up with blood,

01:19.227 --> 01:21.594
so, technically, he probably
drowned on his own blood.

01:22.497 --> 01:25.198
Why didn't we know about
Brett's death sooner?

01:25.266 --> 01:27.066
Apparently someone
was clocking in for him.

01:27.135 --> 01:28.768
Guys, this is one of the reasons

01:28.837 --> 01:31.137
that clock-in buddies is a bad idea.

01:31.608 --> 01:33.174
Also, it could've been
blunt force trauma.

01:33.236 --> 01:35.436
I mean, at those wind speeds,
even a coffee mug

01:35.505 --> 01:37.238
could blow your chest plate wide open.

01:37.306 --> 01:41.008
At any rate, we hereby
dedicate this bench to Brett,

01:41.077 --> 01:43.310
where he used to sit on his flip phone

01:43.379 --> 01:45.479
and argue with his wife for hours.

01:45.548 --> 01:47.214
Yeah, now might not be the best time,

01:47.283 --> 01:49.183
but if anybody still hasn't
chipped in for the plaque,

01:49.252 --> 01:50.751
it's $6.83 each, so...

01:50.820 --> 01:53.153
Just, you know, get it
to me when you can.

01:53.222 --> 01:55.623
His body isn't even cold yet, Jonah.

01:55.691 --> 01:58.559
Because he's probably still alive,

01:59.214 --> 02:02.467
basking on some beach
in the Mediterranean.

02:02.468 --> 02:04.398
Yeah, just waiting for his
foot stump to heal.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.191
Could've been impaled by a curtain rod.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.658
I mean, for all we know,
he could be one of

02:08.728 --> 02:10.193
several people on the same rod.

02:10.263 --> 02:13.097
Hopefully, for his sake,
he was on one of the ends.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.499
Okay, Sandra, how about another song?

02:15.568 --> 02:18.536
Oh. Okay, uh, it's not a song,

02:18.604 --> 02:21.105
but I-I did learn a new chord.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.004
Nope, no... that's not it.

02:26.345 --> 02:27.150
Nope.

02:28.712 --> 02:31.892
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

02:36.605 --> 02:38.622
So that was a... Cloud 9 funeral.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.039
Yep, there was way more fanfare

02:42.040 --> 02:43.460
when Deborah got hit by a forklift.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.507
Sorry I missed that.

02:45.508 --> 02:47.932
You know, Brett's actually
the first person

02:48.000 --> 02:49.667
I ever knew who died.

02:49.735 --> 02:50.734
Really?

02:50.803 --> 02:52.303
What about, like, your grandparents?

02:52.378 --> 02:54.696
Nope. All still alive and healthy.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.674
My Pop-pop can run an eight-minute mile.

02:57.422 --> 02:58.922
That's a weird thing to brag about.

02:58.991 --> 03:01.424
I'm just saying. It's pretty fast.

03:01.493 --> 03:02.926
I go to, like, three funerals a year.

03:02.995 --> 03:04.661
It's a good excuse to see family.

03:04.730 --> 03:06.329
I don't even know anybody
who's ever been in, like,

03:06.398 --> 03:07.564
a major accident.

03:07.633 --> 03:08.965
Also a weird thing to brag about.

03:09.034 --> 03:10.934
Except for Garrett, maybe.

03:11.798 --> 03:15.633
That was an accident, right?
He was... how, uh...

03:15.874 --> 03:17.607
Huh. I don't know.

03:17.676 --> 03:18.991
Me neither.

03:19.069 --> 03:21.311
- I feel like I should know that.
- Why?

03:21.380 --> 03:24.447
Because he's, you know,
one of my best friends.

03:24.516 --> 03:26.016
And my roommate.

03:26.084 --> 03:28.785
We're definitely close
enough for me to know.

03:28.854 --> 03:30.387
We pee with the doors open.

03:30.455 --> 03:32.222
I don't pee in front of anyone.

03:32.291 --> 03:35.004
Well then, I guess you
don't have any best friends.

03:39.631 --> 03:41.131
Oww!

03:41.222 --> 03:42.958
Ohh! These things are impossible.

03:43.620 --> 03:44.771
Yeah, and who is gonna steal

03:44.772 --> 03:47.622
a "Matrix 2" and "3" box set?

03:47.690 --> 03:49.690
Okay, I can't, I can't...

03:49.759 --> 03:51.859
- This is blood. I'm bleeding.
- Where?

03:51.928 --> 03:53.761
Hey, you two. How's it going?

03:53.830 --> 03:55.663
Ugh. Pretty sucky.

03:56.652 --> 03:57.465
Because of Brett?

03:57.922 --> 03:59.133
Huh?

03:59.202 --> 04:02.503
I think it's very, very likely
that he is still alive.

04:02.572 --> 04:06.541
But if you two are upset about
his disappearance,

04:06.609 --> 04:08.743
then you can take a break for a while.

04:08.811 --> 04:10.511
Oh, no, that's okay, we don't...

04:10.580 --> 04:12.146
Thank you, Glenn.

04:12.215 --> 04:15.917
We, um, we could really use
a chance to sit and reflect.

04:15.985 --> 04:18.886
You know, Brett was like
a father to me, so...

04:18.954 --> 04:23.157
Yeah, and he was... he was like
a grandfather to me.

04:24.928 --> 04:29.163
Uh, I'm young enough that he was
also like a grandfather to me.

04:29.232 --> 04:30.765
I had no idea.

04:30.833 --> 04:34.368
Well, you two take as
long as you need, okay?

04:34.870 --> 04:36.636
You know, a book of Matthew says,

04:36.705 --> 04:38.438
"Blessed are those who mourn..."

04:38.507 --> 04:41.408
Glenn, we're gonna mourn in our own way.

04:41.477 --> 04:43.577
Yeah.

04:43.645 --> 04:45.345
Nice.

04:47.716 --> 04:50.283
Hey, Dina, Justine's
complaining about an odor

04:50.352 --> 04:51.885
in the women's room again.

04:51.954 --> 04:54.839
She's describing it as
a liquid raccoon smell.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.724
Hey, Dina. You okay?

04:57.793 --> 05:00.504
What? Yeah, sorry, I just

05:00.630 --> 05:01.828
haven't really been sleeping lately.

05:01.897 --> 05:04.242
You know,
weather's getting worse.

05:04.618 --> 05:05.917
I'm starting to think
we should get everyone

05:05.986 --> 05:07.519
into the new storm shelter.

05:07.586 --> 05:09.817
Uh, I don't think
that's necessary.

05:09.818 --> 05:11.057
It's just a rainstorm.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.800
Tell that to Brett. Oh, wait, you can't.

05:13.801 --> 05:16.294
'Cause he's smeared
all over the Midwest.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.476 --> 05:32.044
I get that it's weird
for a dude to say this,

05:32.112 --> 05:33.712
but I'm gonna miss Brett's laugh.

05:33.781 --> 05:36.782
Me too, me too. Hey, man, uh,
let me ask you something.

05:36.850 --> 05:37.703
How...

05:39.919 --> 05:43.687
How, uh... How did, how were you...

05:43.757 --> 05:44.701
I'm sorry. What?

05:44.702 --> 05:46.391
No, it's just... wh... did... did...

05:46.460 --> 05:49.294
Were you always...
Did... because I don't...

05:49.363 --> 05:51.263
Oh, look! Look at that!
That's Amy. Hey, Amy.

05:52.028 --> 05:55.275
Hey. Have you guys noticed
anything weird about Dina?

05:57.604 --> 05:58.904
Well, Dina's her own thing.

05:58.972 --> 06:00.872
We've had sex in three different houses,

06:00.941 --> 06:02.941
and I'm not totally sure
any of them were hers.

06:03.010 --> 06:06.578
Okay. I mean, not normal
Dina-weirdness, like,

06:06.647 --> 06:07.979
something's off.

06:08.048 --> 06:10.515
I don't know. I mean,
maybe she's just...

06:12.052 --> 06:12.818
Oh! See?

06:16.156 --> 06:19.491
Attention... all customers and
employees to the storm shelter.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.860
Now, people! Let's go!

06:22.996 --> 06:24.563
Ugh! Move, grandpa!

06:25.821 --> 06:28.121
Oh, she's picking that lady up.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.778
Again, I'm so sorry for the false alarm.

06:37.780 --> 06:39.913
There's no tornado.
You're free to leave.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.915
Now, better safe than sorry,
so no apologies.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.585
Yes, but, well, we are apologizing.

06:44.653 --> 06:46.420
I am absolutely not apologizing.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.422
- Well, some people should be.
- Well, some people

06:48.491 --> 06:49.890
should shut their damn yaps.

06:49.959 --> 06:53.360
Anyway, as a thank you,
please enjoy a coupon

06:53.429 --> 06:55.896
for 50 cents off frozen
yogurt in the café.

06:55.964 --> 06:58.319
We could only find ten.

06:58.406 --> 07:01.307
So... get them while they're hot.

07:02.352 --> 07:03.237
Thank you.

07:05.377 --> 07:07.408
Give one to her.
Dina was really rough with her.

07:21.705 --> 07:25.759
Hey, Myrtle, you've been
here a long time, right?

07:25.790 --> 07:27.893
Since 1987.

07:28.167 --> 07:29.329
Oh, yeah, so you were here, then,

07:29.398 --> 07:31.365
when Garrett first started...

07:31.434 --> 07:34.284
The Cards were in the World Series.

07:34.566 --> 07:38.005
I was having an affair with Ozzie Smith.

07:38.827 --> 07:40.861
The Wizard, we used to call him.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.963
Wow, no kidding. So...

07:43.032 --> 07:45.895
Turns out it wasn't really Ozzie.

07:45.896 --> 07:48.335
He was a waiter at Beffa's,

07:48.404 --> 07:51.939
which was a popular
establishment back then.

07:52.007 --> 07:54.007
Beffa's? Never heard of it.

07:54.076 --> 07:58.946
I once saw Al Wiman having
a roast beef sandwich there.

07:59.014 --> 08:03.483
Well, he ordered it.
I don't recall if he ate it.

08:03.552 --> 08:04.851
That's a really good story.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.554
- Um, Myrtle, when...
- Back then,

08:07.623 --> 08:10.190
people were tougher than they are now.

08:10.259 --> 08:13.527
You can't even call someone a [bleep]

08:13.596 --> 08:15.662
Even if they're being one.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.772
Which reminds me of a story...

08:19.030 --> 08:22.569
I once had a sister-in-law
who really was [bleep],

08:22.638 --> 08:24.538
and she was adorable.

08:24.614 --> 08:27.736
I finally get to catch up
on Kylie Jenner's Insta.

08:27.737 --> 08:29.737
Man, she does sponsored
posts in a way that

08:29.806 --> 08:32.072
make you really believe
that she loves the product.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.073
I know. It's beautiful.

08:34.143 --> 08:36.744
How's it going, you two?

08:36.813 --> 08:39.113
Oh, uh... comes in waves.

08:39.182 --> 08:42.883
One second I'm, like, "Huh?"
And the next I'm, like, "Huh."

08:42.952 --> 08:44.852
Well, you know,
I'm still holding out hope

08:44.921 --> 08:46.754
that Brett's alive.

08:46.823 --> 08:48.689
Even with the foot?

08:48.758 --> 08:51.725
I don't wanna
re-litigate the foot, but...

08:51.794 --> 08:54.765
I did wanna write a Brett tribute

08:54.766 --> 08:56.664
for the newsletter...
you know, just in case.

08:56.727 --> 09:01.100
And you guys knew him so well
I thought maybe you could help.

09:02.179 --> 09:04.672
Of course. I mean,
we would love to honor him.

09:05.595 --> 09:07.174
So what was his wife's name?

09:07.818 --> 09:08.642
Um...

09:09.283 --> 09:10.244
- Cinnamon.
- Margaret.

09:10.313 --> 09:11.445
Cinnamon Margaret?

09:11.514 --> 09:12.746
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

09:12.815 --> 09:15.557
Uh-huh. That is... what we said.

09:16.268 --> 09:19.106
Okay, uh, I also wanna
include a funny story.

09:19.723 --> 09:20.354
Well...

09:20.423 --> 09:24.091
We obviously have... so many of those.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.326
Obviously.

09:25.394 --> 09:27.294
- From real life.
- Mm-hmm.

09:27.363 --> 09:30.364
Great. Okay.

09:31.808 --> 09:33.407
Cheyenne, what's your favorite?

09:37.085 --> 09:38.251
Just a heads-up, we're gonna need to do

09:38.319 --> 09:39.819
a full restock of the jerky.

09:39.888 --> 09:41.087
I'm taking this down
to the storm shelter.

09:41.156 --> 09:42.622
Oh, do we need that much?

09:42.691 --> 09:44.257
Tornadoes last, like, 15 minutes.

09:44.325 --> 09:46.125
Uh, what if the roof caves in?

09:46.194 --> 09:48.661
Sorry, everybody. Looks like
we're gonna starve down here

09:48.730 --> 09:51.064
because Amy thought we'd only
be trapped for 15 minutes.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.566
Uh, Dina? That seems a little dramatic.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.902
"Okay, uh, Dina?
That seems a little dramatic."

09:55.970 --> 09:57.470
Look, I don't have time
to roast you, okay?

09:57.539 --> 09:59.839
I still need sun lamps,
mylar blankets...

09:59.908 --> 10:01.974
Are you maybe going through anything

10:02.043 --> 10:03.810
you wanna talk about, or...

10:03.878 --> 10:05.678
Okay, I need to have games for morale.

10:05.747 --> 10:07.513
Chess, Scrabble, Uno for the dummies.

10:07.582 --> 10:10.349
Okay, Dina? I'm worried about you.

10:10.418 --> 10:12.752
- As a friend.
- You wanna be a friend?

10:12.821 --> 10:14.554
Go freeze a couple
hundred pounds of chard.

10:15.192 --> 10:16.322
I'm not doing that.

10:17.002 --> 10:17.757
Fine.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.460
Guess we won't have chard.

10:31.272 --> 10:33.539
Okay. Thank you.

10:34.139 --> 10:35.872
Hey, Sandra, how's it going?

10:36.007 --> 10:38.244
I just found out Jerry's
feeding tube got infected and...

10:38.313 --> 10:39.545
Ah, same here.

10:39.928 --> 10:41.027
So let me ask you a question,

10:41.096 --> 10:43.199
but don't tell Garrett.

10:43.842 --> 10:44.869
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:44.870 --> 10:48.278
Has he ever told you how
he ended up in a wheelchair?

10:49.043 --> 10:51.474
Um... let me think.

10:51.534 --> 10:52.767
Hey, what's up, guys?

10:52.769 --> 10:53.188
Hey.

10:53.805 --> 10:55.071
Hey! What's going on?

10:55.140 --> 10:56.572
What you guys talking about?

10:56.641 --> 10:57.707
Nothing.

10:57.776 --> 10:59.108
Nothing?

10:59.177 --> 11:01.577
So you guys are just in the hallway

11:01.646 --> 11:04.814
staring at each other saying nothing?

11:04.883 --> 11:06.682
Well, not nothing. I mean, we were...

11:06.751 --> 11:07.984
we were talking about...

11:08.052 --> 11:10.160
Jonah's going to a barbecue,

11:10.161 --> 11:11.760
and he asked if it'd be interesting

11:11.829 --> 11:14.296
to put burrata on a burger
instead of provolone.

11:14.365 --> 11:16.965
And I said, "Who uses provolone?"

11:18.602 --> 11:21.136
And he was laughing,
and then I started laughing.

11:21.205 --> 11:24.540
And then he asked,
"Are burgers cliché in general?"

11:24.608 --> 11:27.976
And I said, "No, not
if you use venison."

11:28.045 --> 11:29.511
But then you said,

11:29.580 --> 11:32.481
"Venison does not
pair with burrata," so...

11:32.550 --> 11:33.571
here we are.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.545
Yeah. A-and then you...

11:36.614 --> 11:38.380
- and then you came up.
- Mm-hmm.

11:38.449 --> 11:41.483
- So...
- Well, I'm sorry I asked.

11:42.878 --> 11:44.286
- Okay.
- I-I'll see you around.

11:44.355 --> 11:45.788
Mm.

11:45.856 --> 11:48.257
Wow, you are an incredible liar.

11:48.326 --> 11:49.242
Thank you.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.732
Swam up the Panama Canal.

11:56.801 --> 11:59.568
Hey, how long was he
a cowboy trick rider for?

11:59.637 --> 12:03.739
Well, he was in the circuit
for a number of years

12:03.808 --> 12:05.498
with his horse named...

12:08.693 --> 12:09.445
Cloud Tie.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.243
- Cloud Tie.
- Yeah.

12:11.372 --> 12:13.949
And, uh, then he joined the Marines.

12:14.018 --> 12:17.019
He was in the... Blue Shirt Division.

12:17.692 --> 12:19.888
- Okay.
- At the battle of, uh...

12:19.957 --> 12:22.424
- Khaki Pants.
- Yep.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.293
Like it sounds?

12:24.362 --> 12:25.661
Mm-hmm.

12:25.730 --> 12:29.465
K-H... K... A-K-I.

12:29.533 --> 12:31.734
I just think that the tornado
and this Brett stuff

12:31.802 --> 12:33.402
is really affecting you.

12:33.471 --> 12:34.970
How many iodine tablets
to sterilize urine?

12:35.039 --> 12:36.739
Is it two or three?
I really couldn't say.

12:36.807 --> 12:38.340
Maybe err on the side of caution.

12:38.409 --> 12:41.310
Are you okay?
'Cause you seem a little manic.

12:41.775 --> 12:43.274
Is this your thing? Do you like to

12:43.343 --> 12:45.243
just follow people
and tell them everything

12:45.311 --> 12:47.045
you think is wrong with them?
'Cause I could do that too.

12:47.113 --> 12:49.480
- No, that's not...
- Hair. Chin. Shrimpy build.

12:49.549 --> 12:51.182
Boobs. Well, left boob.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.419
I'm willing to ignore that
because I know you're lashing out.

12:54.421 --> 12:56.208
- Ankles.
- I have joint inflammation!

12:56.209 --> 12:57.806
- You need to get help!
- I'm fine!

12:59.955 --> 13:02.056
Sorry.

13:02.124 --> 13:02.780
Dina?

13:04.262 --> 13:06.096
I think there's something
wrong with Dina.

13:06.098 --> 13:08.265
Heck, yeah, there is.

13:08.267 --> 13:09.924
No, Glenn. It wasn't a diss.

13:11.117 --> 13:12.316
Okay.

13:12.889 --> 13:14.989
Good burn! That was fun.

13:15.058 --> 13:16.724
Hey, let's do Elias now...

13:16.793 --> 13:19.760
Glenn, I think the tornado
really affected her.

13:19.829 --> 13:21.996
I don't know if this is a
workman's comp type of thing,

13:22.065 --> 13:23.297
but she needs to talk to someone.

13:23.366 --> 13:25.299
Oh, Lisa's a good listener.

13:25.368 --> 13:27.768
I was thinking like a professional.

13:27.837 --> 13:30.771
Ohh! Okay.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.608
Now, we don't have a binder
on dealing with tornadoes,

13:33.676 --> 13:35.943
but I did find one
on workplace shootings

13:36.012 --> 13:37.778
that I think I can make work.

13:37.847 --> 13:40.915
The tornado was like two months ago.

13:40.984 --> 13:42.216
We're over it.

13:42.285 --> 13:44.051
Well, maybe you are.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.688
But maybe there's someone else
who's having trouble coping.

13:47.757 --> 13:49.590
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter.

13:49.659 --> 13:50.781
- Is it Sandra?
- Nope.

13:50.782 --> 13:52.293
- Is it Dina?
- I'm not gonna say.

13:52.362 --> 13:53.895
- Carol.
- No!

13:53.963 --> 13:55.296
- Thanks, Ames.
- I'm sorry.

13:55.365 --> 13:57.031
This is not what I had in mind.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.733
"If you're reading this,
then your branch

13:58.801 --> 14:01.736
has been the victim
of a workplace... tornado.

14:01.804 --> 14:04.516
Workplace tornados
are a growing epidemic

14:04.587 --> 14:07.362
that we need to face while
still respecting the right

14:07.394 --> 14:10.845
of every American to own tornados."

14:10.914 --> 14:11.879
It's good.

14:21.925 --> 14:25.793
"Many tornado victims describe worrying

14:25.862 --> 14:27.695
that behind every hallway,

14:27.764 --> 14:30.998
there's a lone tornado
waiting to tornado them."

14:31.067 --> 14:32.266
This is waste of time.

14:32.335 --> 14:34.302
Look, Dina. I just think

14:34.370 --> 14:37.104
that you're holding in
a lot of pent-up emotion

14:37.173 --> 14:39.140
and that it's good
to talk about these things.

14:39.208 --> 14:40.775
I learned that in couples therapy.

14:40.843 --> 14:42.677
Oh, and that worked out
great for you, didn't it?

14:42.745 --> 14:43.978
Dina, that didn't

14:44.047 --> 14:45.646
work out for them, though, actually.

14:45.715 --> 14:47.781
- They're getting a divorce.
- I know.

14:47.782 --> 14:48.982
You know, there's no shame

14:49.050 --> 14:50.516
in admitting you're having a tough time

14:50.585 --> 14:51.751
dealing with something, okay?

14:51.820 --> 14:54.466
In college, I discovered that my dad

14:54.467 --> 14:56.867
was having an affair on Parents Weekend.

14:56.936 --> 14:58.369
Try enjoying "Stomp" after that.

14:58.437 --> 15:00.171
Ugh, that's your trauma?

15:00.239 --> 15:02.473
I watched my brother drown
in the South China Sea.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.942
Well, it's not a contest.

15:05.011 --> 15:06.343
Well, if it was, you'd lose.

15:06.412 --> 15:08.212
I went to the movie "Saw"

15:08.281 --> 15:10.080
thinking it was about carpentry.

15:10.149 --> 15:11.482
It is not!

15:11.551 --> 15:13.484
I threw up in my lap.

15:13.553 --> 15:16.320
And then Jerusha made us stay
because it was our date night

15:16.389 --> 15:18.122
and the tickets were non-refundable.

15:18.191 --> 15:19.723
Okay, there's a lot to unpack there,

15:19.792 --> 15:22.126
but let's circle back to Dina.

15:22.195 --> 15:24.895
I once got caught trying to run

15:24.964 --> 15:27.464
a badger game in Kansas City.

15:27.533 --> 15:30.834
Ha. I had to cut my way out.

15:40.379 --> 15:42.279
Thank you, Cheyenne, for taking us

15:42.348 --> 15:44.281
through your visit to Cancun, but...

15:44.350 --> 15:47.151
I'm not clear...
what was traumatic about it?

15:47.220 --> 15:49.520
Nothing. It was awesome.

15:49.589 --> 15:52.823
Great. Okay, uh, well,
who hasn't shared yet?

15:52.892 --> 15:55.226
- Uh, Garrett hasn't.
- Oh. Garrett?

15:55.294 --> 15:57.828
Oh, no, I've lived a blessed life.

15:57.897 --> 15:59.330
I have something.

15:59.398 --> 16:01.365
My first apartment
was in a pet cemetery...

16:01.434 --> 16:03.801
You're saying nothing traumatic

16:03.869 --> 16:05.469
has ever happened to you?

16:05.538 --> 16:09.206
'Cause, you know,
this... this is a safe space.

16:10.076 --> 16:11.800
Well, when I was a kid,

16:11.801 --> 16:13.244
I was really into horseback riding.

16:13.312 --> 16:14.945
I was good at it too.

16:15.014 --> 16:17.381
Until Chestnut bucked me
going over a hurdle

16:17.450 --> 16:18.949
and I landed on my neck.

16:20.024 --> 16:22.219
Doc said I was lucky to walk away.

16:22.288 --> 16:24.888
But I came in last place, so...

16:24.957 --> 16:27.825
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, that sounds bad.

16:27.893 --> 16:30.194
Are you kidding?
That's, like, nothing.

16:30.263 --> 16:31.829
My worse trauma was when Sandra

16:31.897 --> 16:34.098
tried to murder me during a tornado.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.620
I didn't try to murder you.

16:36.469 --> 16:38.369
I just didn't try to save you.

16:38.437 --> 16:41.090
I love your friendship. Frick and Frack.

16:41.357 --> 16:42.873
You know, this...
right here, right now...

16:42.942 --> 16:45.809
- this is my greatest trauma.
- Glenn, let's wrap this up.

16:45.878 --> 16:47.511
- Yeah. I'm out of here.
- No, Dina...

16:47.580 --> 16:48.977
Look. Listen. I get it.

16:48.979 --> 16:50.344
You want me to suddenly get in touch

16:50.345 --> 16:52.483
with some deep, dark
emotions, but guess what.

16:52.551 --> 16:54.451
I don't have time
to whine about my issues,

16:54.520 --> 16:56.220
and frankly, I am sick of listening

16:56.289 --> 16:57.788
to all you people whine about yours.

16:57.857 --> 16:59.056
Get off me!

16:59.125 --> 17:00.257
Move, Brett!

17:07.028 --> 17:09.262
So, apparently when the
tornado was coming,

17:09.477 --> 17:11.808
Brett was able to run
and make it to his car.

17:11.809 --> 17:14.685
And then his car got
swallowed up by the tornado?

17:14.685 --> 17:17.085
- No, he just drove home.
- Oh.

17:17.387 --> 17:18.887
And then we emailed the wrong Brett,

17:18.955 --> 17:20.923
so we never knew
he was scheduled to work.

17:20.991 --> 17:23.425
Well, I knew he wasn't dead.

17:23.493 --> 17:25.493
Yeah. I guess you were right.

17:25.563 --> 17:27.396
Though, just between you and me,

17:27.464 --> 17:29.314
I thought he was dead for sure.

17:30.401 --> 17:32.447
But now look at him. God bless.

17:32.448 --> 17:34.204
Hanging out with his best friends.

17:34.905 --> 17:37.072
Oh. Never knew they were friends.

17:37.141 --> 17:39.208
You sure are bagging those groceries.

17:39.276 --> 17:42.411
Oh. I thought you had
a spider on your shoulder.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.446
Oops. Oh. Got it. There it is.

17:44.515 --> 17:45.714
There it is.

17:45.783 --> 17:47.182
Is Glenn still watching?

17:47.251 --> 17:48.517
Yep.

17:48.586 --> 17:49.518
Okay.

17:51.288 --> 17:54.131
Wait. Oh, my God. Whose foot was that?

17:57.127 --> 17:59.695
Hey, man. I'ma take off early.

17:59.763 --> 18:02.431
I, uh... saw a motorcycle
in the parking lot

18:02.500 --> 18:06.969
and it's the same motorcycle
that I was riding the night...

18:07.037 --> 18:08.704
- it all went down.
- Okay, all right.

18:08.772 --> 18:10.606
Okay, okay, I get it.
You're messing with me.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.040
You can stop now.

18:12.109 --> 18:13.609
Cool.

18:13.677 --> 18:14.943
Hey, just an FYI.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.112
I wasn't trying to be nosy. I just...

18:17.181 --> 18:20.048
I thought it would be cool
to know you better. That's all.

18:20.117 --> 18:22.384
You know, you're my roommate,
and you're my best friend, and...

18:22.453 --> 18:24.653
Okay. First of all,
I don't need a best friend.

18:24.722 --> 18:25.930
I'm an adult.

18:25.931 --> 18:27.360
And if I did have a best friend,

18:27.361 --> 18:29.157
it would be my boy Randy Mendoza.

18:29.226 --> 18:31.068
We've known each other
since the second grade.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.098
Always about Randy...

18:32.099 --> 18:34.963
Look. What if I told you
I got shot in Iraq?

18:35.032 --> 18:37.332
Or got drunk and hit a bus full of nuns?

18:37.401 --> 18:38.528
Is this also in Iraq?

18:38.529 --> 18:41.196
Whatever it is, it's
gonna put me in a box.

18:41.649 --> 18:42.848
And I don't want that.

18:45.239 --> 18:46.318
Understood.

18:48.289 --> 18:50.723
Hey. D... um... does Randy know?

18:50.791 --> 18:52.591
Of course. He's my best friend.

18:54.495 --> 18:56.095
That's messed up.

18:58.432 --> 18:59.836
Wow.

19:00.868 --> 19:03.402
Really got everything in here, huh?

19:03.471 --> 19:06.105
Beef jerky...

19:06.173 --> 19:07.546
beans...

19:08.876 --> 19:10.008
pornography?

19:10.668 --> 19:12.177
People are gonna need a release, Amy.

19:12.246 --> 19:14.480
It could be hours down here.

19:14.548 --> 19:17.783
Look, you know Brett is alive, right?

19:17.852 --> 19:20.352
No one died. It's all okay.

19:20.421 --> 19:23.188
So, we can just head out.

19:23.257 --> 19:24.623
I'm not leaving.

19:27.595 --> 19:31.663
You cannot... stay... down here!

19:31.731 --> 19:33.284
Are you being serious right now?

19:33.285 --> 19:34.744
Oh, God.

19:35.669 --> 19:37.336
Okay, you know what?

19:37.405 --> 19:39.805
Fine. I get it. You don't want my help.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.708
I give up. I'm giving up.

19:42.777 --> 19:43.636
Great.

19:44.862 --> 19:49.381
Oh, it's just getting sad at this point.

19:49.450 --> 19:50.890
You're so tiny!

19:51.552 --> 19:53.652
Look, you know what?

19:53.721 --> 19:55.687
Just for that, you don't
get a space in the shelter.

19:55.756 --> 19:57.723
Oh, I'm so sad that I don't get a spot

19:57.792 --> 19:59.391
in your little masturbation jail.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.493
All jails are masturbation jails.

20:01.562 --> 20:02.828
Look, things happen, okay?

20:02.897 --> 20:04.530
You can't be prepared for everything.

20:04.598 --> 20:05.664
No, you can't prepare for everything,

20:05.733 --> 20:08.037
but I can and I always do.

20:14.175 --> 20:15.674
- Dina...
- Forget it.

20:15.743 --> 20:17.242
You don't wanna hear about my problems.

20:17.311 --> 20:18.716
No, I-I do.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.213
Of course I do.

20:21.951 --> 20:22.848
Really?

20:22.917 --> 20:25.250
I couldn't sleep or eat,

20:25.319 --> 20:29.688
so I just watched old VHS tapes
of the 1994 Winter Olympics.

20:29.757 --> 20:33.559
I'm Team Tanya all the way,
you know?

20:33.627 --> 20:35.160
- Mm.
- I'm pretty sure

20:35.229 --> 20:38.230
Nancy Kerrigan
hit herself in the leg.

20:38.299 --> 20:42.067
Nobody tells you at six
that a dog can't eat chocolate.

20:42.136 --> 20:43.936
Oh, wow. We're going
back to the beginning.

20:44.004 --> 20:45.671
Okay.

20:45.739 --> 20:47.448
And for the rest of camp,

20:48.175 --> 20:51.009
all the kids called me "Bagel Boobs."

20:53.414 --> 20:56.281
I just feel like this feeling
is gonna last forever.

20:56.350 --> 20:58.532
I know. With Adam gone,

20:58.532 --> 21:00.099
I'm on my own for the first time,

21:00.167 --> 21:01.600
and I'm just... I'm terrified.

21:01.669 --> 21:03.434
Maybe don't make this
about you right now.

21:03.457 --> 21:05.516
Yeah. No. Sorry. You go, you go.

21:05.623 --> 21:07.056
- You go.
- Okay.

21:07.203 --> 21:09.182
So I think we got up
to my tenth birthday?

21:09.183 --> 21:10.702
Mm-hmm. We're at ten.

21:10.703 --> 21:15.214
It's about to get really bad.
