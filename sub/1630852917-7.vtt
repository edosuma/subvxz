JOHNNY: Hey, hey.

Nope, you're staying behind me.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.946
(dog whines)

00:15.215 --> 00:17.816
I got some wolf
(bleep) right here.

00:17.885 --> 00:20.685
Full of caribou hair
so that's a good sign.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.922
I'm actually seeing more moose
sign than I thought I'd see out here.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.693
But it looks kinda old, too.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.027
It's like the
little willow plants,

00:29.030 --> 00:30.963
you can see that.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.966
There's like old moose sign where
they've been nipping on the little buds.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.436
I can see 'em
kind of all around me.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.171
Probably smells those wolves.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.109
Which way do I want to go?

00:44.912 --> 00:48.080
Kinda seeing if there's any animals
moving around in these ridges.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.185
This owl right here
up in this tree again.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.155
Feels like this sucker's
been following me around.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.992
It's like any time I stop,
picking blueberries or

01:00.060 --> 01:01.994
something like that or
talking to Java it like,

01:02.062 --> 01:05.864
suddenly just lands
and just stares down at me.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.567
I'm not like a
spiritual person too much

01:08.602 --> 01:11.736
but I kinda think
I wanna make this

01:11.739 --> 01:15.808
my little spiritual
hunting buddy right here.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.177
Take me to the caribou, dude.

01:23.217 --> 01:26.818
It's looking that way, so.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.820
Maybe that's where
the caribou are at.

01:28.823 --> 01:30.823
Or moose, might be worth it.

When you're open like that,
you're gonna see a lot more.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.100
You're gonna
appreciate nature way more,

01:41.168 --> 01:44.970
and honestly, it's
gonna take you further.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.538
That's a lot of ice.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.409
I'm out in the
Brooks Range of Alaska.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.879
Uh, very remote, very isolated.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.417
Seasons are changing
this time of year,

02:32.486 --> 02:37.990
I'm going from the very short
fall into a long, cold winter.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.759
I'm essentially gearing up for

02:40.761 --> 02:44.629
the most important
hunt of the year.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.364
This is a hunt
that you put up, uh,

02:46.367 --> 02:48.633
enough food to last you months,

02:48.636 --> 02:51.970
to get you by when no
other game animals are around.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.239
That's what's going to kind
of make or break my winter.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.308
Aside from the ice
this beach is great.

02:56.310 --> 02:59.044
Essentially this is what
you call winter's knocking

02:59.112 --> 03:00.512
at the door right here.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.380
You know, it's gonna
hinder me from hunting,

03:02.383 --> 03:03.782
it's going to
hinder me from fishing,

03:03.784 --> 03:05.317
pretty soon I won't be
able to travel on this lake and

03:05.319 --> 03:06.451
I won't be able to fish.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.053
That's why I wanna
focus on, on, big game,

03:08.121 --> 03:10.055
'cause that's what's gonna
get me through the winter.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.858
That's pretty much all I
need for several months,

03:12.926 --> 03:17.262
so this location here is
gonna be a great starting point.

03:17.331 --> 03:21.200

wake up in a little shelter and

03:21.268 --> 03:22.434

the ice but Java's having fun.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.879
Beautiful beach.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.547
What more could I ask for?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.150
Yeah, these trees...

03:38.218 --> 03:43.488
I'm kinda just looking for two trees
that are about my body length apart,

03:43.490 --> 03:45.157
something I can lay between.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.559
Nothing fancy, but something's
that's just gonna allow me to

03:47.628 --> 03:49.127
just wake up and go hunting.

I think these
are gonna work good.

SONTA: Indigenous people,
are the first scientists,

04:00.174 --> 04:01.240
of our world.

04:01.308 --> 04:04.309
We're so connected to
what the animals are doing,

04:04.378 --> 04:06.912
what the fish are doing and
they haven't returned this year.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.446
The cycles have changed.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.315
That's really
scary in the Arctic.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.720
Rain or shine we're
out here, aren't we?

04:15.723 --> 04:17.122
You know it's fall time.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.990
And these are the, uh...

04:18.993 --> 04:20.992
Dynamics that we're
working with out here, and...

04:20.995 --> 04:23.128
SYDNEY: I think
I'll do a shine, shine.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.396

04:24.464 --> 04:26.731
SONTA: Sometimes it's really
good fishing when it's rainy though.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.568
So, you can't miss out on what's
going on underneath the water, right?

04:32.006 --> 04:33.405
So, this time of year typically

04:33.473 --> 04:37.142
we'd have our smoke house
full of salmon and fish and

04:37.144 --> 04:40.412
fish processed by now,
but we had a baby this summer.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.748
In addition to that, the other
obstacle we had going against us

04:43.751 --> 04:46.018
is that there really
were no fish this year.

04:46.086 --> 04:50.756
So, really we're looking for
this fall fishing time to meet

04:50.824 --> 04:52.224
our needs throughout the year.

04:53.577 --> 04:56.161
All right guys, we found a
good spot to put the net, I think.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.164
Ryder I'm gonna
need your help, okay?

04:59.166 --> 05:00.565

05:00.567 --> 05:02.367
SONTA: All right here,
you see this good eddy?

05:02.369 --> 05:04.636
That's how you know it's a
good spot to tie up the net.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.038
Looks like a great spot.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.440
Come on out.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.509
One of our big responsibilities
is teaching our children

05:11.512 --> 05:13.511
how to live off the land.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.579
Awesome, come on out.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.781
You got it?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.182
Way to go, buddy.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.951
Okay now go ahead and wrap
this around that tree two times.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.121
RYDER: Oh, I got it.
SONTA: Okay, cool.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.191
The Athabaskan people have been
doing this for thousands of years and

05:26.259 --> 05:28.727
we're not gonna be
the generation that stops that.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.596
Pull it against
the tree, there you go.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.864
Mm-hmm.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.934
We want our kids to
take ownership of fishing.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.003
There we go, ready
to go set this net?

05:38.071 --> 05:40.138
RYDER: I think it's good.
SONTA: Okay, let's jump in.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.741
Okay Sydney we're gonna need
your help, why don't you come on out.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.943
SYDNEY: Okay.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.012
SONTA: Okay Daddy, we're ready.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.151
Just let it go, let it go.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.953
Just kinda throw it, yup.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.289
Doing good. Doing good.

05:58.959 --> 05:59.891
Got the end.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.826
Here we go.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.960
Okay, you guys ready?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.561
RYDER: Yeah.
SONTA: We're gonna count.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.230
One, two...

06:05.232 --> 06:07.399
RYDER: Two, three.
SYDNEY: Two, three.

06:10.104 --> 06:12.371
SYDNEY: Yay!
SONTA: Good!

06:12.439 --> 06:15.907
It's perpendicular to the bank,
so we got a good angle on it,

06:15.976 --> 06:17.042
that's what we want to see.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.844
It's not going into an
S-curve or anything like that.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.647
CHEVIE: How does it look, Sonta?
SONTA: Hey, Chev, we're good!

06:22.716 --> 06:24.115
Good job, guys.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.817
SYDNEY: Good job, yay!
RYDER: Yeah, that was good.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.319
SONTA: We'll see
what we get here.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.760
ROBERT: One of the
dangers in Sitka is weather.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.530
And you've gotta
be ready for it.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.665
You gotta be
confident in your abilities

06:40.667 --> 06:43.068
to make wise decisions
if the weather's bad.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.336
And you can't let
those things control you,

06:45.339 --> 06:47.806
you just gotta get out
there and live your life.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.750
ROBERT: Thanks for
driving the boat today and

06:58.819 --> 07:00.419
giving me a chance
to relax a little.

07:00.487 --> 07:01.653
RJ: Yeah, it's
gonna be a good day.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.556
ROBERT: Coming up
on Black Rock, huh?

07:04.624 --> 07:06.825
RJ: I think, I think
that's probably our best bet.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.529
ROBERT: Yeah, I mean if the weather
breaks a little we can peek out and see.

07:14.151 --> 07:15.834
RJ and I are gonna
head out fishing,

07:15.902 --> 07:18.970
my freezer's low and
I know a few elders in town

07:18.972 --> 07:20.639
that don't have any fish yet.

07:20.707 --> 07:21.773
Piled up for the winter.

07:21.842 --> 07:25.310
So RJ was, uh, kind enough
to come along with me and

07:25.312 --> 07:28.313
we're gonna try to
catch some black sea bass.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.981
And then if the
weather looks good enough

07:29.983 --> 07:32.383
we'll try to sneak
out and get some halibut.

07:32.386 --> 07:33.918
So, once we get out there,

07:33.921 --> 07:35.720
we'll feel it out
and see what happens.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.257
Well how about putting your
old man on some fish today?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.725
RJ: I already know how you are;

07:40.794 --> 07:42.527
you always catch
the first fish so.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.095
(laughs)

07:45.265 --> 07:48.200
Yeah, we got lots of birds,
they're feeding on bait.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.135
That's a pretty good sign.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.103
Give it a drift,
let's see what's happening.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.606
ROBERT: In order to
catch these sea bass,

07:54.608 --> 07:57.342
we're gonna use some herring.

07:57.410 --> 08:00.545
Maybe we can hook into a
king salmon or a coho but

08:00.547 --> 08:02.481
we're just gonna target
sea bass this morning.

08:05.419 --> 08:06.952
Oh yeah.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.152
There's a lot of
rock fish down there,

08:08.155 --> 08:09.488
look at that one.

08:09.556 --> 08:10.955
Oh yeah, that's a
good one right there.

08:10.958 --> 08:11.890
RJ: Oh yeah, that's a nice size.
That's a good one.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.291
I like that.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.227
ROBERT: That's a
nice keeper right there.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.562
RJ: Oh, is that scary?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.631
ROBERT: If we can get
ten of these real quick and

08:19.633 --> 08:22.133
then we'll process them up, huh?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.939
Pretty little but man those
are pretty good taco meat.

08:30.177 --> 08:34.112
My background as a Tlingit, Alaskan
Native here in Sitka, Alaska, well,

08:34.114 --> 08:36.047
Tlingit people are water people.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.116
This is our culture, you know?

08:38.184 --> 08:39.985
And there's just,
without the ocean,

08:40.053 --> 08:43.088
I don't think I
could feel alive.

08:44.591 --> 08:45.924
Oh.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.199
Hey y'all, look at that.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.334
Here's a rock fish.

08:58.071 --> 08:58.803
I knew she was gonna lick it.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.472
(laughs)

09:01.608 --> 09:03.808
All right, we gotta our ten and
bleeding the last one, huh, bud?

09:03.877 --> 09:04.876
RJ: Yeah, let's get out of here.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.811
ROBERT: Let's go
try to get a halibut.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.214
We'll see how the
weather looks out front.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.749
It looks like it's not too bad.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.953
All right.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.621
I think we should
head out to the deep and

09:16.690 --> 09:21.593
just see if we can get some
action and see if it's safe or not.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.569
JOHNNY: I'm a firm believer of,

09:30.637 --> 09:33.104
if you put the work
in you get results out.

09:33.173 --> 09:38.443
Whether that's covering miles and
miles of country looking for animals or

09:38.511 --> 09:41.446
putting your heart and
soul into building something.

09:41.448 --> 09:44.983
I think that if
you put the effort in,

09:45.051 --> 09:48.587
if you put the work in you will
get the results you're looking for.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.659
It's a pretty sweet gig.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.565
(creaking)

10:14.081 --> 10:16.348
JOHNNY: That wind's picking
up and you can hear what

10:16.416 --> 10:18.683
ice is forming
along the shoreline.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.351
It's all getting
just pushed in here and

10:20.354 --> 10:22.954
it sounds like a, like a
wind chime or a rain stick.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.357
(creaking)

10:25.959 --> 10:29.094
It's these little moments,
these little sounds that

10:29.162 --> 10:34.366
I try not take for granted or just kind of
like pass up without enjoying for a second.

10:34.434 --> 10:40.304
And as beautiful as it sounds it also is
a good stark reminder that, you know,

10:40.307 --> 10:41.906
winter is right
around the corner.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.510
And that's what's always interesting
about these little moments is like

10:45.578 --> 10:49.547
the beauty but the
fury that comes with it.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.451
I better get
back to the shelter.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.595
Now I have the shelter built,
the spruce boughs are just gonna

11:03.663 --> 11:07.866
keep the snow off of me because it's
not really rainy season anymore and

11:07.934 --> 11:11.202
I know that by looking
at these clouds and

11:11.271 --> 11:14.806
the snow that's gonna be
coming in, in the next coming days.

11:14.808 --> 11:18.009
It's gonna be my last chance to
kinda go out and do a little bit

11:18.011 --> 11:21.379
of fishing on the lake before
the ice starts forming too much.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.950
So this is, uh, about
the last piece here.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.952
It's good enough.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.354
Java.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.423
Try to go catch a fish, huh?

11:32.426 --> 11:33.692
Get a little food in us.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.864
Man, this ice is
building up fast.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.501

Come on, load up.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.772
Whewie.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.809
Could be a little, uh,
storm rolling in.

11:53.914 --> 11:57.782
I've had some sunny skies the
past couple of days, and, uh,

11:57.851 --> 11:58.850
I think that's it.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.820
I think the sun is a thing
of the past right now.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.858
And even nature's trying to
fight me right now to keep me

12:06.926 --> 12:08.593
from coming out here fishing.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.162
The weather just
completely flipped on a dime.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.466
Uh, I hope it
doesn't affect my hunt,

12:14.534 --> 12:16.000
I hope it doesn't
affect the fishing.

the snow come from?

12:29.099 --> 12:30.565
I think I'm
gonna try right here.

12:32.102 --> 12:33.601
See what I can do.

12:37.441 --> 12:39.541
God, everything's all frozen.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.323
The Arctic's not always the easiest
place to catch fish in my experience.

12:55.325 --> 12:58.059
Water's very
cold and, um, you know,

12:58.061 --> 12:59.861
it makes the fish
move a lot slower.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.130
It's not always
the most ideal place.

13:02.198 --> 13:06.468
And like, just like this,
that fast I got a wall of snow

13:06.536 --> 13:07.802
coming in right there.

13:07.804 --> 13:09.737
The weather's
changing really, really quick.

Wonder if it was that snow owl
that's been kinda following me around,

13:15.278 --> 13:17.479
that's bringing
me the good luck?

13:17.547 --> 13:19.247
Or it could be bad luck.

13:22.418 --> 13:23.852
Well, that was a
tap right there.

13:25.956 --> 13:26.955
Whoo!

13:27.023 --> 13:28.556
Hell, yeah.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.024

a little fight to it.

13:41.438 --> 13:42.904

Trout, lake trout.

14:06.663 --> 14:10.398
Nice. Awesome.

14:28.752 --> 14:30.484
These things are
loaded with fat,

14:30.487 --> 14:34.422
loaded with oil and, uh,

14:34.424 --> 14:37.358
God with this
snow coming down now

14:37.427 --> 14:39.961
it's gonna keep me warm in
my shelter is what I'm hoping.

14:40.297 --> 14:45.400
This is absolutely insane,
it is, it is coming down.

14:46.570 --> 14:48.303
It's gonna be a
cold night tonight, Java.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.307
It's gonna be a cold one.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.308
And this stuff
came out of nowhere.

14:54.311 --> 14:57.311
I can't even see the
lake over there anymore.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.647
It's insane man, winter, like,

14:59.649 --> 15:03.551
it just, it creeps in
and then it creeps in fast.

15:08.858 --> 15:10.258
Yeah, I knew it was going
to be chilly but I didn't know

15:10.326 --> 15:11.893
it was gonna be like this.

15:13.597 --> 15:15.863
We'll see what
tomorrow morning looks like.

15:15.865 --> 15:18.599
But hopefully that snow
will kind of push those caribou

15:18.602 --> 15:19.968
down from the mountains.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.605
But this is all
just kind of, you know,

15:23.673 --> 15:26.140
a prelude to the hunt.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.981
Yeah, things are
changing quick out here.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.957
CHEVIE: With
change you have to adapt.

15:42.959 --> 15:46.227
And there's always diversity in
life and you have to adapt to it,

15:46.229 --> 15:50.164
you have to think about
what you could do to get by and

15:50.166 --> 15:53.935
still live a comfortable life
and provide for your family.

16:00.977 --> 16:02.844
CHEVIE: All right,
we're gonna get out.

16:02.912 --> 16:06.047
And get this, uh, net checked.

16:06.516 --> 16:10.785
It's a rough day, wind's blowing,
howling out of the south here.

16:10.853 --> 16:15.056
It's cold, rainy, it's one of these days
where, where I want to just go out,

16:15.124 --> 16:19.260
get this net checked by myself
without having to worry about a baby and

16:19.262 --> 16:22.530
Sonta and kids
and all that stuff.

16:22.532 --> 16:25.733
So we're gonna see what
we have in this net today.

16:25.735 --> 16:29.871
When the wind starts blowing
like this out of the south,

16:29.939 --> 16:32.673
the location that we're in with
our net sometimes we get filled

16:32.676 --> 16:34.275
with a bunch of drift.

16:34.344 --> 16:36.744
You can't catch fish if
you're catching sticks.

16:36.813 --> 16:38.346
Little problematic.

16:38.348 --> 16:41.949
So the fishing is, uh,
been down this year,

16:42.018 --> 16:44.151
there hasn't
been any summer chum,

16:44.154 --> 16:47.488
haven't been able to
target any salmon so, uh,

16:47.490 --> 16:48.690
another little bump in the road,

16:48.758 --> 16:51.225
gotta keep rolling
through it though man.

16:51.294 --> 16:52.760
Can't sweat the small stuff.

16:52.829 --> 16:54.495
We're gonna catch
fish sooner or later,

16:54.564 --> 16:57.165
you just gotta stick to it
so that's what we're gonna do.

17:00.170 --> 17:02.570
All right, I'm gonna
pull up here to the net, um.

17:02.638 --> 17:05.239
I'm not seeing tons of drift
right here floating towards

17:05.308 --> 17:08.242
the net so that's a
good thing, but, uh,

17:08.244 --> 17:10.978
we do have some drift in there.

17:10.980 --> 17:14.582
But I just hope for no big logs
or anything that gets rolled up

17:14.650 --> 17:17.985
in there something where
I gotta, it rips my net or

17:17.987 --> 17:23.257
does something funky
like that, so, uh, see here.

lot of drift in here.

17:28.398 --> 17:30.531

We'll try to get this cleared
up without ripping my net,

that's the big thing so
that I can get this reset.

high water, wind, rain,

of here sooner than later.

our limit of sea bass in,

we're on our way out to
the halibut spot now.

The water looks great
today for halibut fishing,

so that's gonna
be our main goal.

19:12.418 --> 19:13.818
We'll go out there and
we're gonna throw the hook,

19:13.886 --> 19:15.953
anchor up and we're gonna
try to catch some halibut.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.557
Can you put a
three pounder on ours?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.292
RJ: Yup.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.163
ROBERT: So we're out here now,
we got the anchor set, um.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.165
We put a three pound weight on

19:27.233 --> 19:29.833
and a hook and
then we have a bait bin here

19:29.836 --> 19:31.502
that's full of salmon carcasses

19:31.571 --> 19:35.106
and we're just gonna put remnants
of the salmon on our hooks.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.707
We'll, uh, drop
them to the bottom,

19:36.709 --> 19:38.860
trying to get a chum trail.

19:38.912 --> 19:41.179
We'll be putting a lot
of fresh bait down here.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.314
Trying to get that scent
trail going out with the tide,

19:43.316 --> 19:44.848
and that will attract them in.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.186
It's like bears coming in to
a fresh kill on the beach so

19:48.254 --> 19:49.720
they can smell
it from miles away.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.827
Fishing now.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.899
See what happens.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.736
RJ: Fish on!

20:05.738 --> 20:06.637
ROBERT: That looked
like a good bite, RJ.

20:06.656 --> 20:09.407
Is it on?

20:09.475 --> 20:10.875
RJ: Oh, it's on.

20:10.943 --> 20:11.943
You wanna get up that one, Dad?

20:12.011 --> 20:13.277
ROBERT: Yeah, bud.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.214
Halibut, five minutes,
one halibut.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.950
RJ: That's like a 30 incher.
ROBERT: Those are good eaters.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.287
There you go.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.022
Nice, this is a good one.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.490
Bleed him, throw him in the box.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.763
RJ: Yeah let me
get my line down.

20:33.099 --> 20:36.834
ROBERT: With chum trail it's
very similar to a hyena and

20:36.836 --> 20:40.037
there's a dead animal, and
it starts to stink pretty bad.

20:40.106 --> 20:44.508
I imagine every hyena within
five miles down wind of that is

20:44.577 --> 20:45.710
gonna come in and investigate.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.378
Well, halibut are the same way.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.313
They're gonna come investigate
because they're always hungry

20:49.315 --> 20:50.648
and they wanna eat, too.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.016
RJ: There we go, ready, Dad?

20:54.453 --> 20:57.188
ROBERT: Sometimes it takes an
hour or two to the chum these halibut in,

20:57.256 --> 21:00.124
and sometimes you just get
lucky and catch 'em right away.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.062
I got a little one on, chicken.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.967
There it is.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.372
I got my limit, I'm gonna eat
that one for dinner tonight.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.475
That will be a good
family meal right there.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.345
Well, we limited it out
on halibut and, and sea bass.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.613
RJ: Yup.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.614
ROBERT: That wasn't too hard,

21:23.683 --> 21:25.883
but today I had a
lot of fun with you RJ.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.819
RJ: Good, I had
fun with you, too.

21:28.888 --> 21:32.023
ROBERT: All right, pull this
anchor and get out of here.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.824
Maybe tomorrow
we'll get a bigger one.

21:37.763 --> 21:39.363
SONTA: Fishing is one of the
things that we want to make sure

21:39.432 --> 21:43.634
our kids know about,
care about, yearn for.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.237
It's our livelihood, it's
something we really enjoy and

21:46.305 --> 21:49.173
it's something that we want to instill
in the kids as a really strong value.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.341
Part of who they are.

21:56.582 --> 21:57.381
SONTA: Ah, this feels nice.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.849
Pretty warm out
right now, I like that.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.384
CHEVIE: It is, it is nice out.

22:00.386 --> 22:03.054
SONTA: Compared
to the rainy cold,

22:03.122 --> 22:05.323
I mean this is foggy
but it's pretty warm out.

22:05.391 --> 22:06.991
CHEVIE: 50 degrees.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.193
Just another day on the Innoko,

22:09.261 --> 22:12.062
we're just happy to be on
the river right now and, uh,

22:12.065 --> 22:14.131
be able to check the net.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.600
So I'm really, really
looking forward to it.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.269
What are we gonna
get in our net today, kids?

22:18.337 --> 22:21.205
EMERY: Whitefish!
RYDER: Pike.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.407
EMERY: Whitefish,
whitefish, whitefish, whitefish.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.675
Whitefish!

22:24.677 --> 22:27.278
CHEVIE: You know what I'm always
hoping for is no driftwood.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.679
SONTA: There we go.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.681
So every day's a
different day out on the water.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.484
You know, one day we get
all driftwood in the net.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.953
Some days they're just a bust,
that's one of the things that

22:36.021 --> 22:37.421
comes with just fishing.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.890
So we hope for fish every day,
we weren't able to get that

22:39.959 --> 22:44.028
many this summer so we're
setting our, our net in the water,

22:44.096 --> 22:46.830
checking it every day and
slowly over time we're gonna

22:46.833 --> 22:48.766
increase the number
of fish that we catch.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.834
Increase the number of fish
we have in our freezer which is

22:50.837 --> 22:53.204
none right now and just
put it away for the winter.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.911
Okay, let's see
what's in this net, guys.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.179
Sydney you're gonna help me?

23:02.181 --> 23:03.481
SYDNEY: Uh, yeah.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.119
SONTA: Let's see
what's in this net.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.588
Come on, Bean.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.594
Hopefully we got more
fish than we do drift,

23:16.662 --> 23:18.396
it looks like we got
some drift in the net.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.331
SYDNEY: I thought that
was a fish or something.

23:21.334 --> 23:22.800
SONTA: Okay.

23:22.868 --> 23:25.068
Yeah, so this is definitely not
fish and definitely not alligators but

23:25.071 --> 23:26.870
we got some major
drift in the net.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.606
Oh, what do we got here Chev?

23:28.674 --> 23:30.040
SYDNEY: What is that?

23:35.498 --> 23:37.698
'S in this net.

23:37.767 --> 23:39.767
Oh, what have we got here, Chev?

23:39.769 --> 23:42.903
SYDNEY: What is that?
SONTA: Oh, there we go.

23:42.972 --> 23:44.304
What kind of fish is that?

23:44.307 --> 23:45.639
SYDNEY: Look, it's a pike.
SONTA: There you go.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.575
Pull that pike in.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.643
Good job.

23:52.315 --> 23:53.781
Keep pulling it.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.783
There's only one way to teach
and that's getting your hands

23:55.851 --> 23:57.852
in there and getting busy.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.587
Pull it hard.

24:00.590 --> 24:02.857
And then you
start wiggling it out.

24:04.326 --> 24:06.193
Nice.

24:07.330 --> 24:09.263
It's been great just
to watch Sydney learn.

24:09.265 --> 24:11.598
She was out there getting
her hands in the water,

24:11.601 --> 24:13.400
getting her
hands on the fishnet,

24:13.469 --> 24:14.935
getting more aware
of her surroundings,

24:15.004 --> 24:16.303
and kinda what's going on.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.140
SYDNEY: I think we should be
careful with that fish, Mom.

24:20.143 --> 24:22.743
I see that the net's
not fully around it.

24:22.745 --> 24:23.544
SONTA: That's okay.

24:23.612 --> 24:24.812
It's probably
caught in the gills.

24:24.814 --> 24:26.280
This is really
called a gill net.

24:26.282 --> 24:29.416
It's 'cause it gets
caught in the gills.

24:29.485 --> 24:31.018
SYDNEY: True.

24:31.020 --> 24:32.286
Is that whitefish, Mom?

24:32.288 --> 24:33.487
CHEVIE: Yeah,
that's a whitefish.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.022
SONTA: Whitefish.
SYDNEY: Yes! I was right!

24:35.090 --> 24:36.824
SONTA: Hold on,
I'm stuck, there we go.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.093
It's coming in, Emery.

24:39.161 --> 24:41.962
We got your whitefish for
you, hanging on by a gill.

24:42.031 --> 24:45.032
After you get really good at
this, Sydney, you'll be fast.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.366
Here you go, babe.

24:46.369 --> 24:47.701
There's your whitefish, Emery.

24:47.703 --> 24:50.103
Yahoo! Still alive.

24:50.106 --> 24:52.506
Nice and fresh,
this is exciting.

24:52.508 --> 24:54.041
It's a good spot.

24:54.043 --> 24:56.510
We could be here all day,
just back and forth.

24:56.512 --> 24:57.311
Checking this net.

24:57.313 --> 24:58.712
(laughs)

25:00.850 --> 25:02.116
I think there's a
lot of people that think

25:02.184 --> 25:04.718
they can do this kind of work.

25:04.720 --> 25:08.255
And it just takes being on
site and learning how to do it.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.523
And so that's
really how we teach.

25:09.592 --> 25:10.791
And Sydney's doing great.

25:10.860 --> 25:12.159
We're really proud of her.

25:14.197 --> 25:15.796
There you go.

25:15.865 --> 25:18.065
Okay, it'll start to
straighten itself out here.

25:18.067 --> 25:19.399
Good job.

25:19.402 --> 25:21.735
All right Sydney, so we
got about what, four fish?

25:21.737 --> 25:23.003
SYDNEY: Um, yeah.

25:23.005 --> 25:25.873
SONTA: Four fish is, um, kind
of what we expected actually.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.608
Um, this is starvation time.

25:27.676 --> 25:30.143
Things are hard right now and
so we're happy with what we got.

25:30.146 --> 25:32.946
We'll get these in the smokehouse
and get hung and start drying.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.081
Cool.

25:34.149 --> 25:35.415
Okay, Chev, we're good.

25:35.418 --> 25:38.485
Good job, all in
a day's work, kids.

25:38.487 --> 25:40.287
Let's get this fish cut up.

25:44.493 --> 25:48.028
JOHNNY: Subsistence hunter,
gatherer, fisherman, butcher,

25:48.030 --> 25:51.632
chef, logger, craftsman.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.902
All these different
jobs in order to thrive

25:54.970 --> 25:56.703
and subsist out
here in the wild.

25:57.306 --> 26:02.709
No other job I've ever had requires
me to have that many job titles.

26:02.712 --> 26:04.211
And I think it's pretty cool.

26:05.448 --> 26:11.819
(imitating moose calls)

26:18.727 --> 26:21.996
JONHHY: Yeah, I wake up today
so ambitious to get out hunting.

26:22.064 --> 26:24.331
And what I wanna
target is moose.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.267
But the first
thing about hunting,

26:26.335 --> 26:31.605
my game plan is generally to
just let the land speak to me.

26:31.607 --> 26:34.474
Let the land tell me
what I should be hunting.

26:34.477 --> 26:35.776
You're doing good, Java.

26:38.614 --> 26:40.781
The wind's blowing this
way which is excellent.

26:42.885 --> 26:47.287
'Cause, 'cause it keeps my scent away
from where I think the moose would be.

26:47.290 --> 26:48.622
There's a little
tundra behind, like,

26:48.691 --> 26:51.158
right over there.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.627
And I think moose
would be hanging out there.

26:53.696 --> 26:55.696
I just gotta listen
and I got to stay quiet.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.698
So it's kinda
finding the balance,

26:57.766 --> 27:00.167
trying to figure out,
what do I wanna hunt?

27:00.169 --> 27:03.103
Because if I go out
there with a closed mind,

27:03.105 --> 27:05.439
thinking this is
what I want from nature,

27:05.441 --> 27:07.174
nature won't give it to me.

27:07.242 --> 27:09.309
Nature's gonna
tell me what to hunt.

27:09.312 --> 27:12.179
Nature's gonna tell me
what animal to go after,

27:12.247 --> 27:15.382
and I'm going to listen to
nature as I always do 'cause

27:15.451 --> 27:16.917
nature's never steered me wrong.

27:20.122 --> 27:22.456
I think I see caribou swimming
across the lake right now.

27:25.995 --> 27:31.531
See, that's the problem with
calling for moose in caribou country,

27:31.534 --> 27:33.800
is that they're
going north right now.

27:33.803 --> 27:36.070
But this time
of year, caribou go south.

27:36.138 --> 27:38.138
So, that means they
came across the lake,

27:38.207 --> 27:40.808
probably heard me
calling for moose,

27:40.876 --> 27:43.944
and they bailed 'cause
they're swimming fast.

27:44.013 --> 27:45.746
They wouldn't be swimming
fast for fun, you know?

27:45.814 --> 27:47.681
They're swimming
fast to get away,

27:47.750 --> 27:49.549
because they probably heard me.

27:49.552 --> 27:50.851
(bleep).

27:52.955 --> 27:57.624
It feels like I just blew my caribou
chances by focusing on moose.

27:57.693 --> 27:59.359
That's a bummer.

27:59.362 --> 28:03.563
I think I'm gonna see
if they go left or right.

28:03.566 --> 28:07.634
If they go left, they're
gonna go along the lake.

28:07.703 --> 28:09.870
And I'm gonna head
this way and intercept 'em.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.241
Yeah, I got one going
this way right now.

28:14.243 --> 28:15.709
Let's boogie.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.446
Java, come on.

28:19.515 --> 28:21.215
Let's go. Come on.

28:25.521 --> 28:27.387
Caribou are
incredible swimmers and that,

28:27.390 --> 28:29.923
that lake's over a mile wide.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.959
They're just swimming
across it like it's nothing.

28:34.063 --> 28:38.331
Seeing caribou scared and swimming
across the lake isn't a problem.

28:38.334 --> 28:40.267
To me, it's a solution.

28:40.269 --> 28:44.204
It's finding answers
by listening to the land,

28:44.273 --> 28:46.940
by paying attention to nature.

28:46.942 --> 28:49.476
It's telling me,
abandon the moose hunt.

28:49.545 --> 28:51.111
Go for caribou.

28:57.419 --> 28:59.019
ROBERT: My family
has been in Sitka, Alaska,

28:59.088 --> 29:00.620
for 10,000 years.

29:00.623 --> 29:04.992
It's in my blood and I think there's
generational muscle-memory that's passed on.

29:06.895 --> 29:10.297
I was able to pick it up and
continue with modern technology,

29:10.299 --> 29:11.398
and I think that's awesome.

29:17.773 --> 29:19.306
Today we're out here,
we're gonna head out and

29:19.308 --> 29:20.641
try and get some halibut.

29:20.709 --> 29:24.111
Fill up my freezer and try to
feed some elders at the same time.

29:24.113 --> 29:25.179
It's gonna be a great day.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.385
We're gonna anchor up here
for at least a couple hours.

29:32.388 --> 29:34.521
See if we can catch a
halibut to take home.

29:35.791 --> 29:37.858
Just waiting for the boat to
settle down a little bit here.

29:39.328 --> 29:41.462
I think I brought RJ
fishing when he was, uh,

29:41.530 --> 29:43.864
probably less than
six months old with me.

29:45.668 --> 29:47.601
He's been coming ever since.

29:47.603 --> 29:50.337
He knows his stuff
out here really well.

29:50.339 --> 29:53.474
I couldn't imagine having a
better fishing buddy than my son.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.342
It seems like every time
I pick up the phone to say,

29:55.410 --> 29:56.610
"Hey, you wanna go fishing?"

29:56.678 --> 29:59.413
For some reason my son's
number is on speed-dial and

29:59.481 --> 30:01.348
that's the only person I call.

30:01.350 --> 30:03.083
Three-pound lead today.

30:03.152 --> 30:04.618
Let's see if we can
get down there with that.

30:06.622 --> 30:08.088
All right, going down.

30:08.157 --> 30:09.156
I'm excited.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.158
Going fishing.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.694
We're going after
the big boys today.

30:14.763 --> 30:16.497
Get it to go through all,
through all the sharks.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.899
It's at about 90 feet right now.

30:24.707 --> 30:26.907
Fish on! We got a ripper.

30:26.975 --> 30:30.711
RJ: There he goes.
ROBERT: Big one over here.

30:30.779 --> 30:32.112
It's still
taking line, look at that.

30:32.181 --> 30:33.147
RJ: Hell, yeah.

30:35.984 --> 30:37.050
(grunts)

30:37.386 --> 30:39.786
ROBERT: We got a shark.

30:39.788 --> 30:41.522
Them things are strong.

30:45.728 --> 30:47.127
(bleep)!

30:47.196 --> 30:48.862
I am having the hardest time.

30:48.864 --> 30:50.597
RJ: Here I'll, uh,
help you out with that.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.966
ROBERT: I can see the hook.
It'll be an easy release.

30:55.337 --> 30:56.503
Watch your hand.

30:58.407 --> 30:59.706
Good job.

31:00.876 --> 31:02.809
What do you think
that was, a 40-pound shark?

31:02.811 --> 31:05.646
RJ: I don't know.
Two and a half feet?

31:08.350 --> 31:09.983
ROBERT: That oughta
do something.

31:15.558 --> 31:17.658
Come on fish.
I know you're down there.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.027
RJ: Holy cow!

31:20.095 --> 31:21.562
(laughs)

31:21.630 --> 31:22.896
ROBERT: Are you on?

31:22.965 --> 31:25.799
RJ: Yeah, I'm on.
ROBERT: We're fishing now.

31:27.436 --> 31:29.303
Got a big one on.
At least 100 pounds.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.838
RJ: I can't even
get him off the bottom.

31:31.907 --> 31:33.240
ROBERT: Oh, you're
gaining on it now.

31:33.242 --> 31:34.741
A little bit.

31:37.179 --> 31:39.646
Oh, there it is, color.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.381
What is it?

31:41.450 --> 31:42.516
RJ: This thing is a monster.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.240
♪ ♪

31:50.242 --> 31:52.375
ROBERT: What is it?
RJ: This thing is a monster.

31:52.378 --> 31:58.382
I think it's a big
freaking huge halibut.

31:59.919 --> 32:03.320
ROBERT: Oh, my God.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.121
Maybe 160 pounder.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.990
RJ: Yeah, 160, 150.

32:06.992 --> 32:09.192
ROBERT: There's gonna be a lot
of food there for the freezer.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.528
RJ: Definitely.
That's a good sized keeper.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.664
If I can, oh, he's peeling now.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.767
ROBERT: Good job, RJ.
RJ: Well, we're not there yet.

32:18.003 --> 32:19.937
They come off just as easy.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.538
You wanna grab it
over on this side?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.206
Nah.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.674
ROBERT: Just
hold him here, right?

32:24.677 --> 32:26.510
RJ: Yeah, just keep
his head under the water.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.513
Make sure he's got hooks in.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.618
ROBERT: We didn't get the
other one on the other side, RJ.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.554
That was, that gap
straightens out on you.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.238
RJ: Woo! Nice!
ROBERT: Yeah.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.908
RJ: That's a nice 'but.
ROBERT: Hey, girl.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.242
What do you think?

32:59.244 --> 33:01.044
That thing can kick your
butt if you're not careful.

33:01.046 --> 33:03.380
RJ: Yeah, that's probably...
ROBERT: 130?

33:03.382 --> 33:06.649
RJ: If I take a good guess, he's
probably about 57, 58 inches and

33:06.652 --> 33:09.119
I'm gonna say probably 120, 130.

33:09.187 --> 33:10.854
ROBERT: 130?
Yeah, that's about right.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.055
RJ: I think you and
I will both be set,

33:12.057 --> 33:13.924
as well as a few
old ladies in town.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.059
ROBERT: Let's go home, bud.
RJ: Sounds good.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.128
Let's call it a day. Nice work.

33:18.196 --> 33:19.729
ROBERT: Good job, bud.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.197
It was a good day.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.399
Awesome.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.539
CHEVIE: Every year's
a new year with kids.

33:29.541 --> 33:33.009
Stuff that you taught 'em last year
is just a stepping stone for this year.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.345
The learning here
takes place on the land.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.013
And that's where we're gonna be,

33:37.016 --> 33:38.315
and that's where
our kids are gonna be.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.819
CHEVIE: All right, Ry-Ry, we're
gonna look for cottonwood

33:42.888 --> 33:45.022
for the smoke house.

33:45.090 --> 33:48.024
It's kinda fun to do stuff
with just me and you, huh?

33:48.027 --> 33:49.626
Yeah.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.961
Hey, look at that cottonwood
right over there, Ryder.

33:51.964 --> 33:53.363
That, that one
looks pretty good.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.500
That's a, its
leaves dead at the top.

33:57.836 --> 34:00.637
There's our, there's our
cottonwood right there, Ryder.

34:00.639 --> 34:04.241
And look it, we got this nice
little place to tie our boat up here.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.410
Let's go up
there and have a look.

34:12.985 --> 34:14.717
You're gonna have
to grab that one.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.852
That one over there.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.787
RYDER: That one?
CHEVIE: Yeah.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.122
Let's see if
this chainsaw starts.

34:19.124 --> 34:20.857
I haven't started it in a while.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.059
RYDER: Can I try?
CHEVIE: Yeah.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.330
RYDER: You just pull it?
CHEVIE: Yeah, rip on it.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.850
(chainsaw rumbling)

34:29.902 --> 34:32.535
It's nice to be out
with my boy, you know?

34:32.538 --> 34:36.073
And, and to have that
father-son relationship.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.474
Sometimes I can be hard on him.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.742
Sometimes it's not
all fun and games.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.246
You know, so I wanna make
sure that I create times that are fun,

34:43.282 --> 34:46.349
that we get to have,
where it's just one-on-one.

34:46.418 --> 34:51.288
Um, and, and I can help him
learn a few different skills and

34:51.356 --> 34:54.224
he can enjoy those times,
and I can enjoy those times.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.561
On the shoulder?

34:57.629 --> 34:59.095
There you go.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.631
Thatta boy. Thatta boy.

35:02.634 --> 35:03.900
This is gonna be
a nice little load.

35:03.902 --> 35:06.636
This will get us smoking
fish for four or five days.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.171
I thought we were
gonna get a bunch of rain,

35:08.173 --> 35:10.574
get all wet, but it
actually turned out to be

35:10.642 --> 35:12.976
a really nice
evening for doing this.

35:16.047 --> 35:18.982
JOHNNY: When you're hunting
for food and not for sport,

35:18.984 --> 35:21.518
it's a very different feeling.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.854
Kind of primal instinct
just takes over me.

35:23.922 --> 35:29.993
And I feel like this hunter-gatherer
that's been shot into the future.

35:30.061 --> 35:33.930
It kind of parallels the way that
people lived for thousands of years.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.403
JOHNNY: This is caribou
droppings right here.

35:42.608 --> 35:46.543
And there's actually just a
little bit of snow around it.

35:46.545 --> 35:50.547
'Cause I keep getting this
kind of like on and off snow.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.215
Sleet.

35:52.217 --> 35:54.217
Where it melts in
the middle of the day.

35:54.286 --> 35:59.256
They're in the area but, uh,
exactly where is the question.

36:05.097 --> 36:07.063
Java, come on.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.238
Caribou swam across the lake.

36:15.307 --> 36:18.441
So, I'm hoping to kind of
come around and intercept them.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.710
And if the timing's right,
I'm thinking they'll be

36:20.779 --> 36:22.979
somewhere over in
this end of the lake.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.716
Time's ticking, man.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.388
Java, nice and easy girl.

36:31.456 --> 36:32.989
Hey.

36:38.847 --> 36:40.897
I thought I heard...

36:46.137 --> 36:47.771
Everything sounds
like an animal.

36:49.474 --> 36:50.707
Come on.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.892
I got a caribou.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.293
I got caribou right here.

37:12.764 --> 37:13.429
That's a big bull.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.798
(sighs)

37:25.043 --> 37:26.676
He see, he sees me.

37:36.988 --> 37:38.622
(gunshot)

37:44.863 --> 37:45.729
(gunshot)

37:45.797 --> 37:46.930
(bleep).

37:56.608 --> 37:57.707
(gunshot)

38:06.368 --> 38:07.834
(gunshot)

38:10.172 --> 38:11.671
JOHNNY: He's down.

38:17.579 --> 38:20.580
One caribou's not gonna
carry me through the winter.

38:20.649 --> 38:22.849
I need two,
I need three caribou.

38:22.851 --> 38:25.585
And that little herd
that was here I shot at,

38:25.587 --> 38:28.254
they just went around the
corner and they're still there.

38:28.323 --> 38:29.589
So I'm gonna try to
get another shot at them,

38:29.591 --> 38:31.057
get another caribou down.

38:43.005 --> 38:44.337
(gunshot)

38:46.741 --> 38:48.008
Go down, buddy.

38:50.478 --> 38:52.545
(dog whines)

38:53.682 --> 38:55.048
We got down a caribou.

38:58.286 --> 38:59.185
(sighs)

39:00.955 --> 39:01.821
That's it right there.

39:01.890 --> 39:03.089
That's two caribou.

39:03.158 --> 39:05.158
We got bull caribous.

39:05.226 --> 39:08.695
A little bit bigger than the
cow, so it's a little bit more meat.

39:08.697 --> 39:11.230
So two of 'em is gonna get
me a pretty good distance into

39:11.233 --> 39:13.966
the start of winter.

39:13.969 --> 39:17.237
You know, one caribou will
last me about six weeks,

39:17.305 --> 39:20.506
so having two of 'em is
a pretty good head start.

39:20.509 --> 39:22.842
I don't know if I'm gonna
see these animals again.

39:22.844 --> 39:25.044
It could be months
before I see 'em again,

39:25.047 --> 39:27.781
so it's, it's important
to get more than one.

39:27.849 --> 39:31.984
And that's the only way I can guarantee
myself meat and food this winter.

39:31.987 --> 39:35.855
And it's just, it's a tough,
tough place to live without meat.

39:35.924 --> 39:37.924
It, it's just you can't do it,

39:37.926 --> 39:41.261
and I've been
eating rice and beans,

39:41.329 --> 39:43.396
and it's just,
it's not sustainable, it's,

39:43.465 --> 39:45.632
I'm just hungry
all the time and,

39:48.069 --> 39:51.071
I got a lot of work to do, Java.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.138
You're excited though.

39:52.207 --> 39:53.540
You couldn't
even keep your cool.

39:57.011 --> 39:59.345
I just never know what's gonna
happen and every day I walk outside

39:59.347 --> 40:03.116
things change and you
just gotta be open to change.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.486
And I like the
challenges of that.

40:06.554 --> 40:08.821
I like the
challenges of, of adapting.

40:08.824 --> 40:13.493
I like not knowing what the
hell's gonna happen out here.

40:13.561 --> 40:16.563
That's essentially
how I live every day.

40:18.299 --> 40:20.300
When the
bounty's good, you take it.

40:20.368 --> 40:22.368
When it rains, you
put your buckets out.

40:22.437 --> 40:26.572
But, at the same time, I'm
also realizing that I've got

40:26.575 --> 40:29.476
a lot more work ahead of
me before that sun goes down.

40:31.913 --> 40:34.981
Just love all the
life happening out here.

40:34.983 --> 40:36.716
Sometimes with life comes death.

40:46.594 --> 40:48.995
WOMAN: Oh, Robert.
ROBERT: Look what we got for ya.

40:49.063 --> 40:53.733
WOMAN: Oh, my.
That is beautiful.

40:53.802 --> 40:56.269
That is really
gonna help me out.

40:56.271 --> 40:58.070
(speaking in native language)

40:58.073 --> 41:00.339
ROBERT: Thank you.
WOMAN: Welcome to come over.

41:00.342 --> 41:01.608
(speaking in native language)

41:01.676 --> 41:02.609
ROBERT: Oh, thank you.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.477
(speaking in native language)

41:04.546 --> 41:06.879
WOMAN: Robert, for all you do.

41:06.882 --> 41:10.216
It really helps out us elders.

41:10.285 --> 41:13.419
And I'm so glad that
you're continuing, both of you.

41:13.421 --> 41:15.221
Both of you.

41:15.223 --> 41:18.358
Because that's what's
gonna keep us going.

41:18.426 --> 41:19.692
ROBERT: Yeah.

41:19.694 --> 41:22.962
WOMAN: Is our younger
generation doing what we used to do.

41:22.964 --> 41:26.299
And I appreciate it so much.

41:26.301 --> 41:28.301
(speaking in native language)

41:28.369 --> 41:30.703
ROBERT: Giving this
meat to the elders,

41:30.772 --> 41:32.572
my son's following
in my footsteps.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.975
I'm so proud and so happy that
he gets to live that same lifestyle.

41:36.044 --> 41:38.711
'Cause it's brought me so
much happiness in my life.

41:38.780 --> 41:40.913
And I know it'll
do the same for him.

41:40.916 --> 41:45.585
I see him with the love
and passion for this land.

41:45.587 --> 41:47.320
That is priceless.

41:47.322 --> 41:48.388
This was a great day.

41:52.994 --> 41:53.726
SONTA: Good job.

41:53.728 --> 41:54.661
You guys did really good today.

41:54.729 --> 41:56.395
I'm proud of you guys
for working so hard and

41:56.398 --> 41:57.597
getting fish put up.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.398
You guys definitely learned
some skills this year and

41:59.401 --> 42:02.401
built on what you learned
last year and the year before.

42:02.404 --> 42:04.604
Ultimately, our kids
will know who they are.

42:04.672 --> 42:07.406
They'll know their
relationship to the land and

42:07.409 --> 42:10.810
they'll have a much stronger
bond to the place here.

42:10.812 --> 42:14.013
I think about it in terms
of generational knowledge.

42:14.015 --> 42:17.150
I wanna be that continuing
thread to the next generation,

42:17.218 --> 42:20.953
so that our kids
learn how to live this way.

42:20.956 --> 42:23.022
CHEVIE: This year is just
definitely a different year with the fish

42:23.091 --> 42:28.628
and the timing and, but we're still just
doing what we can do to fish this year.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.430
SONTA: It's always a nice thing
to have a little bit of fish

42:30.498 --> 42:33.165
put away for the winter and...

42:33.168 --> 42:34.500
One less thing to worry about.

42:34.569 --> 42:36.502
CHEVIE: Yup,
everybody did really good.

42:36.571 --> 42:38.972
SONTA: Everybody
did really good.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.174
CHEVIE: And those eggs
are gonna be delicious.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.210
EMERY: How dare you steal it.

42:51.453 --> 42:52.385
JOHNNY: It's hungry country.

42:52.387 --> 42:55.455
You know, everybody
out here's hungry.

42:55.523 --> 42:57.423
And today I'm not.

42:59.060 --> 43:00.727
It's a good feeling.

43:02.864 --> 43:07.333
It feels good to just kinda
stop a little bit in order to

43:07.335 --> 43:08.801
reflect on that hunt.

43:08.803 --> 43:12.672
Think about the animal's
lives and what that means to me,

43:12.674 --> 43:14.240
the gratitude.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.079
This is what hard work
tastes like right there.

43:20.415 --> 43:22.882
Alaska's the playing field.

43:22.951 --> 43:26.319
And what you choose to do with
Alaska is entirely up to you.

43:27.822 --> 43:30.890
You know,
hardships, pain, suffering,

43:30.892 --> 43:33.092
all that eventually goes away.

43:34.162 --> 43:36.696
But what you're forever left
with is the experiences and

43:36.698 --> 43:37.897
the lessons learned.

43:43.038 --> 43:44.304
PAT: Oh my goodness sakes.

43:44.372 --> 43:46.505
ROBERT: Enjoy it.
PAT: Thank you, Robert.

43:46.508 --> 43:49.442
ROBERT: Thank you.
PAT: Thank you, RJ.

43:49.510 --> 43:50.977
RJ: Thanks Pat.

43:50.979 --> 43:53.045
JOHNNY: The hardest,
toughest moments in life.

43:53.048 --> 43:55.848
Typically become the most
memorable moments in life.

43:55.917 --> 43:57.583
Hell of a day.

43:57.652 --> 43:59.052
Come on.

43:59.120 --> 44:01.120
And it's magic.

44:03.191 --> 44:06.859
You know, that's what keeps
me, uh, coming back out here.

44:06.861 --> 44:08.861
That's what keeps me
continuing the hunt,

44:08.863 --> 44:10.129
continuing the search.

44:14.736 --> 44:15.935
Because at the end of the day,

44:16.004 --> 44:18.671
it's not me that's
in charge, it's nature.
