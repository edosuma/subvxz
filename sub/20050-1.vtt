00:15.057 --> 00:18.187
(Squirrel chattering)

00:20.145 --> 00:21.750
Oh, my fuck!

00:21.751 --> 00:23.355
(Squirrel chattering)

00:25.818 --> 00:26.943
Fuck you, you little

00:26.944 --> 00:28.068
fucking fur-faced fuckhead!

00:28.153 --> 00:29.843
(Gunshots)

00:29.844 --> 00:31.533
(Squirrel chattering)

00:31.616 --> 00:32.676
I'm at fucking war

00:32.677 --> 00:33.736
with the squirrels.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.506
- People think they're dumb.
- They're not.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.656
- The little fuckers even know.
- How to masturbate.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.516
- I seen them do it,
- and they fucking do it a lot.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.630
Check this out.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.774
One of the ugly little

00:42.775 --> 00:43.839
fuckers chewed the wires

00:41.709 --> 00:43.839
in my goddamn bedroom wall

00:43.920 --> 00:45.840
- and this happened.
- And Lucy blamed it on me.

00:45.922 --> 00:47.775
- I mean, I was partying.
- A little more than usual.

00:47.799 --> 00:48.864
And I did put a deep fryer

00:48.865 --> 00:49.929
in the bedroom

00:50.009 --> 00:51.862
and cooked pepperoni - and wings
late at night - When I got hungry.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.596
- But I didn't start.
- The fucking fire!

00:53.679 --> 00:54.849
The cocksucking squirrel did.

00:54.850 --> 00:56.019
And now she's gone!

00:56.098 --> 00:57.518
All because you jacked

00:57.519 --> 00:58.938
your cock furry

00:56.098 --> 00:58.938
little whore sluts!

00:59.018 --> 01:00.848
- Anyway, I am going.
- To rebuild it.

01:00.937 --> 01:01.977
I just haven't had

01:01.978 --> 01:03.017
fucking time yet.

01:03.147 --> 01:04.607
Don't get me wrong,

01:04.690 --> 01:06.418
- I don't advocate the use.
- Of a deep fryer in the bedroom.

01:06.442 --> 01:09.032
Under any circumstances but...

01:09.111 --> 01:10.361
I did a bit of post-fire

01:10.362 --> 01:11.611
investigating on my own

01:11.697 --> 01:13.300
- and it appears.
- The little cocksucker.

01:13.324 --> 01:14.718
- Could have been responsible.
- For the fire.

01:14.742 --> 01:15.807
But, I mean,

01:15.808 --> 01:16.872
blasting up your yard...

01:16.953 --> 01:18.373
that doesn't solve anything.

01:18.454 --> 01:20.044
- (Gunshot) - Ricky!
- Shh!

01:20.122 --> 01:21.207
What are you doing?

01:21.208 --> 01:22.292
Put the fucking gun away!

01:22.374 --> 01:23.399
Lahey said he would

01:23.400 --> 01:24.424
set some traps!

01:24.502 --> 01:25.627
There he is.

01:25.628 --> 01:26.752
There he is...

01:26.838 --> 01:28.338
He's not!

01:28.339 --> 01:29.838
You're starting

01:26.838 --> 01:29.838
to go crazy, Ricky!

01:29.924 --> 01:31.724
- (Gunshot)
- (Squirrel chattering)

01:31.801 --> 01:33.551
Ricky: - Fucking asshole!

01:33.636 --> 01:35.296
I fucking had him!

01:35.387 --> 01:36.824
- (Whispering)
- Ricky, there's Randy.

01:36.848 --> 01:38.598
- Put the fucking gun away.
- Put it away!

01:38.683 --> 01:40.063
Ricky!

01:40.064 --> 01:41.443
Jesus Murphy!

01:41.519 --> 01:43.309
- You pointed it.
- Right at my bird!

01:43.395 --> 01:44.790
Hey, Rick. Little

01:44.791 --> 01:46.185
buggers are at it

01:43.395 --> 01:46.185
again, are they, bud?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.503
Holster your

01:47.504 --> 01:48.733
weapon, Ricky!

01:46.273 --> 01:48.733
Holster my tits, Randy!

01:48.818 --> 01:50.278
- Stand down, Randy.
- I've got this.

01:50.361 --> 01:52.031
Ricky, I know - how stressful.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.072
- This kind of situation.
- Can be, bud.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.216
Listen to what he's

01:55.217 --> 01:56.276
saying to me, I'm trying.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.219
- He's fucking driving - me nuts. Listen to him!
- (Squirrel chirps)

01:58.243 --> 01:59.793
- Ricky!
- You think I'm dumb?

01:59.871 --> 02:01.141
No, you're dumb!

02:01.142 --> 02:02.411
You're about to get dead!

02:02.498 --> 02:03.623
Doing nothing is not

02:03.624 --> 02:04.748
proper procedure.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.434
- He's firing that.
- In every direction.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.547
Someone could die!

02:07.548 --> 02:08.592
Randy,

02:08.670 --> 02:09.795
did I ask you to set

02:09.797 --> 02:10.920
traps here last week?

02:11.007 --> 02:12.587
- Yeah.
- And did you?

02:12.675 --> 02:14.255
- I've been too busy.
- Really?

02:14.343 --> 02:15.888
Disobeying an order,

02:15.889 --> 02:17.433
is that proper

02:14.343 --> 02:17.433
procedure?

02:17.513 --> 02:18.808
The way I see it, all this

02:18.809 --> 02:20.103
gunfire is because you

02:17.513 --> 02:20.103
didn't do your job.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.142
- (Chirping continues) - Bubbles:
- Ricky!

02:22.226 --> 02:23.596
- Set some traps.
- Ricky!

02:23.686 --> 02:25.436
You copy?

02:25.521 --> 02:27.271
- Okay, Mr.Lahey.
- Good.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.606
(Squirrel chirping)

02:28.691 --> 02:29.796
Ricky, my kitties

02:29.797 --> 02:30.901
are over there!

02:30.985 --> 02:32.065
Ricky, your frigging

02:32.066 --> 02:33.145
days are numbered.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.552
As soon as

02:34.553 --> 02:35.867
I get authority,

02:33.237 --> 02:35.867
you're going down.

02:35.948 --> 02:36.988
Never going to happen,

02:36.989 --> 02:38.028
diarr-ena breath.

02:38.117 --> 02:39.761
- But speaking of going.
- Down, and you were,

02:39.785 --> 02:41.745
Why don't you - go down on me?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.515
- Get it, Randy? - It means I want you.
- To blow me.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.334
And you can fuck off

02:45.335 --> 02:47.129
while you're doing it!

02:47.209 --> 02:48.539
Control him, Bubbles.

02:48.627 --> 02:49.732
Control your

02:49.733 --> 02:50.837
fucking appetite,

02:48.627 --> 02:50.837
Randy.

02:50.922 --> 02:52.357
- Oh, oh! You think.
- That's funny, eh?

02:52.381 --> 02:53.971
He wants me - to jerk him off.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.694
- No, you get over here.
- And fucking jerk me off,

02:55.718 --> 02:56.863
You little furry fuckhead!

02:56.864 --> 02:58.008
Ricky! Ricky!

02:58.096 --> 03:00.216
(Theme music)

03:40.429 --> 03:41.494
Bubbles:

03:41.495 --> 03:42.559
Atta girl. There we go.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.350
- Oh, thanks for.
- Doing that, Trin.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.202
- Sorry I fucked up.
- The valve on the thing.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.516
- How's that going?
- Good.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.903
Choppity-chop!

03:48.980 --> 03:52.110
Two more right there.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.210
- Ricky, where the - fuck is Jacob? We're.
- Going to be late.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.879
- Jacob's not the smartest.
- Knife in the drawer, Bubs.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.203
Who fucking knows?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.739
After Julian took off,

03:58.823 --> 04:00.383
- I knew I needed.
- To start running the show.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.010
- Or Ricky was going.
- To wind up back in jail.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.119
So I started making

04:03.120 --> 04:04.204
this stuff right here.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.846
The best fucking pizza sauce

04:05.847 --> 04:07.406
you'll ever jam your lips on.

04:07.498 --> 04:09.018
All fucking organic.

04:09.019 --> 04:10.538
Ricky's growing the vegetables,

04:10.626 --> 04:12.836
- you know, using.
- His expertise in that field,

04:12.920 --> 04:14.898
- And we've been cranking it out.
- Down at the flea market.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.382
As fast as we can make it.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.175
And it's a fucking gold mine!

04:18.257 --> 04:19.968
Cory!

04:20.052 --> 04:21.642
For fuck's sake!

04:21.720 --> 04:23.510
- What is that.
- Right there, Cory?

04:23.597 --> 04:24.967
That's sauce, dude.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.497
No, it's fucking money,

04:26.498 --> 04:27.937
every drop of it.

04:28.019 --> 04:29.249
Money. Get it

04:29.250 --> 04:30.479
in the bottle!

04:30.562 --> 04:32.417
I've been able to get myself

04:32.418 --> 04:34.272
a nice little truck.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.028
Me and Ricky both got

04:36.029 --> 04:37.698
company cellphones, brand new,

04:37.778 --> 04:38.923
which I'm awesome

04:38.924 --> 04:40.068
at using, by the way.

04:40.156 --> 04:41.526
Oh, this one.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.235
And the best thing about it,

04:43.325 --> 04:44.555
nothing fucking illegal

04:44.556 --> 04:45.785
going on, whatsoever.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.520
This is probably the happiest

04:47.521 --> 04:49.170
I've ever been in my life!

04:49.248 --> 04:52.103
I mean, other than

04:52.104 --> 04:54.958
missing Julian... terribly.

04:55.046 --> 04:56.314
- It fucking sucks.
- That Lucy took off.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.168
I mean, after I almost died,

04:58.257 --> 05:00.027
- she gave me an alter-natum.
- To stop partying and I didn't.

05:00.051 --> 05:01.778
- And then Mr.Furry.
- Fuckbrains the squirrel.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.738
- Decides to burn my trailer.
- Down and that was it.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.365
- But it's too bad she didn't.
- Stick around a little longer.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.741
- Because for the first.
- Time in my life

05:06.765 --> 05:08.425
- I actually have.
- My shit together.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.078
- Well actually, it might.
- Even be the third time.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.272
(Lighter clicking)

05:11.273 --> 05:12.442
(Inhaling)

05:12.521 --> 05:14.249
- Sarah: - OK, I can't believe.
- That I'm saying this.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.838
But Ricky has come

05:15.839 --> 05:17.403
full circle since Lucy left.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.364
- Actually it's kind of.
- Since Julian left.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.634
I think that was

05:20.635 --> 05:21.824
a real wake-up call for him.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.011
And it's one thing

05:23.012 --> 05:24.972
to say that you're going
to break up with somebody

05:25.100 --> 05:26.150
but Lucy left the country.

05:26.235 --> 05:27.260
She got a job working

05:27.261 --> 05:28.285
for Tom Arnold as a nanny

05:28.370 --> 05:30.057
- and she's making, like,
- a thousand bucks a week.

05:30.081 --> 05:31.501
At first it was

05:31.502 --> 05:32.921
really hard but...

05:33.000 --> 05:34.420
now I think some time

05:34.421 --> 05:36.040
apart was really good
for Mom and Dad.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.000
- And the money that.
- She sends home for Mo.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.540
Has been super-helpful.

05:39.924 --> 05:41.364
Ricky and Bubbles have brought

05:41.365 --> 05:42.804
a whole new energy to the park

05:42.885 --> 05:44.675
with the new venture.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.312
- And since a lot.
- Of the residents.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.308
Are growing vegetables for them,

05:48.390 --> 05:49.765
many of them are paying

05:49.766 --> 05:51.140
their lot fees.

05:51.227 --> 05:52.597
Hooray!

05:52.686 --> 05:54.266
Look at those beauts!

05:54.354 --> 05:56.250
- Did you ever see - potatoes that.
- Big, buddy?

05:56.274 --> 05:58.154
- Those are tomatoes, Ricky.
- Same thing,

05:58.234 --> 05:59.319
Potato, tomato,

05:59.320 --> 06:00.404
po-tah-to, to-mah-to.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.380
Anyway, who cares? - I mean, we have
this new - Fucking bloom nutrient.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.757
- With that shit I got at.
- The hydroponics convention.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.741
- Look at this!
- Jesus.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.844
I wish I would have - fucking known
about it - When I was growing dope!

06:07.868 --> 06:09.828
- Jacob, where the.
- Fuck have you been?

06:09.912 --> 06:10.977
We had to put up

06:10.978 --> 06:12.099
flyers for Ricky's ball hockey school.

06:12.123 --> 06:13.148
You were supposed

06:13.149 --> 06:14.226
to do that two days ago, dicklips!

06:14.250 --> 06:15.290
Dude, it was 1,500 flyers!

06:15.336 --> 06:16.477
Do you know how long that takes?

06:16.501 --> 06:18.679
Obviously you're as dumb - as a
fucking bug that - Lives in a tree,

06:18.703 --> 06:19.983
- Quite a fucking while!
- Great.

06:20.298 --> 06:22.298
- Now we're going to get.
- A shitty fucking table!

06:22.341 --> 06:23.361
No, we're not.

06:23.362 --> 06:24.444
We're going to get a good table.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.638
- Positive thinking, Ricky.
- Double belly work.

06:27.513 --> 06:28.662
Look at this. New label.

06:28.847 --> 06:29.932
Oh, I like the

06:29.933 --> 06:31.217
little Italy man, that's cool.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.350
Ricky, look close.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.765
What?

06:34.853 --> 06:36.943
It's me, Bubbles!

06:37.022 --> 06:38.732
- Why would I put.
- A stranger on there?

06:38.816 --> 06:40.376
- Well, you should've.
- Made it bigger.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.440
It's good, though.

06:43.988 --> 06:45.278
Oh, fuck, I should've too!

06:46.907 --> 06:49.027
I fell off the wagon

06:49.118 --> 06:51.538
a couple of months back,

06:51.620 --> 06:52.830
and I popped

06:52.831 --> 06:54.040
the question to Randy.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.883
But I made myself a promise:

06:56.959 --> 06:58.709
Before we get married

06:58.794 --> 07:01.094
- I'm going to tell him the truth.
- About Ricky and me.

07:01.172 --> 07:03.262
But, if I tell Randy,

07:03.341 --> 07:04.656
then I'm going to have

07:04.657 --> 07:05.971
to tell Ricky.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.721
And I'm just not sure how

07:07.722 --> 07:09.391
both of them will take it.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.596
Randy: (On radio)

07:10.597 --> 07:12.121
<i>Mr. Lahey! I need</i><i>back-up
immediately.</i>

07:12.407 --> 07:13.472
<i>We have a 314 in progress</i>

07:13.673 --> 07:14.737
<i>at Donnie's. Over.</i>

07:14.826 --> 07:15.911
Randy, can't you handle

07:15.912 --> 07:17.596
a 314 by yourself? Over.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.728
<i>Of course I can, sir!</i>

07:19.815 --> 07:21.709
<i>- But I don't want this to.
- Escalate into a 217. Over.</i>

07:21.733 --> 07:23.488
Oh, for shit's sake...

07:23.489 --> 07:25.243
Okay, I'll be right there.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.241
Ever since Randy's decided

07:27.323 --> 07:29.283
- to try to get into.
- The police academy.

07:29.367 --> 07:30.867
He's been taking this

07:30.868 --> 07:32.367
job way too seriously.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.662
Thank you.

07:33.663 --> 07:34.931
Everybody slow it the fuck down.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.683
- If you don't calm down,
- no fucking sauce.

07:36.707 --> 07:37.892
Ricky! Stop swearing at the customers!

07:37.893 --> 07:39.077
Jesus Christ!

07:39.168 --> 07:40.958
- They're driving me.
- Fucking nuts.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.730
- You, with that - fucked sweater and.
- The weird glasses,

07:42.754 --> 07:44.014
How many you want?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.919
- None.
- Oh, my fucking God!

07:46.008 --> 07:47.028
What is your deal then?

07:47.029 --> 07:48.048
Get the fuck going!

07:48.135 --> 07:49.585
Ricky!

07:49.678 --> 07:50.698
Actually I want

07:50.699 --> 07:51.718
to talk to you

07:51.805 --> 07:53.305
about buying - the recipe.

07:53.391 --> 07:55.271
- The recipe?
- Oh, the recipe...

07:55.351 --> 07:56.811
That's not for sale, sir.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.604
- Just the sauce.
- But thank you.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.062
I own a bunch of

08:00.063 --> 08:01.437
pizza restaurants and...

08:01.523 --> 08:02.983
I love the sauce.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.437
I was thinking...

08:05.527 --> 08:06.857
Five grand?

08:06.945 --> 08:07.945
Five grand?

08:07.946 --> 08:08.946
Like 5,000 dollars?

08:09.031 --> 08:10.076
Oh, my fucking.

08:10.077 --> 08:11.121
God. Done!

08:11.200 --> 08:12.410
Pack it up, Bubs!

08:12.411 --> 08:13.620
We're fucking retired,

08:13.800 --> 08:14.811
buddy, let's go!

08:14.812 --> 08:15.852
Just hang on, Ricky.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.047
Just give us one second.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.130
Ricky, we've got

08:18.476 --> 08:19.220
to think about

08:19.230 --> 08:19.820
this... hard.

08:19.899 --> 08:20.979
This is a big decision.

08:21.059 --> 08:22.539
It's five grand

08:22.540 --> 08:24.019
for words and numbers.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.663
- It's not words.
- And numbers, though.

08:26.363 --> 08:27.433
It's my special recipe.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.626
- Oh, my fuck, I wasn't.
- Ready for this.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.428
We've got to think,

08:31.511 --> 08:33.240
- we've got to think.
- On our feet, right now.

08:33.264 --> 08:35.024
- Holy fuck, what.
- Would Julian do?

08:35.099 --> 08:37.034
- What would Julian do - in this situation?
- Julian?

08:37.058 --> 08:39.037
- Julian would do something.
- Dumb, like tell him.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.871
We're going to fucking - keep making
it and - Supplying him with it.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.916
- But then we've got to keep.
- Making the fucking sauce.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.820
- That's it, Ricky!
- That's it.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.320
- You've just.
- Fucking nabbed it!

08:46.402 --> 08:48.132
Ummm, listen, the, uh,

08:48.133 --> 08:49.862
recipe is not for sale

08:49.947 --> 08:51.697
'cause I am very, you know,

08:51.782 --> 08:53.222
obsessed with the

08:53.223 --> 08:54.662
quality and consistency

08:55.482 --> 08:56.442
of my product

08:56.444 --> 08:57.543
I was to supply you?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.101
You know, wholesale prices.

08:59.102 --> 09:00.581
I supply your chain...

09:00.665 --> 09:01.665
Maybe?

09:04.962 --> 09:06.382
- I think we can.
- Make this work.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.221
- (Whispering)
- My God...

09:09.300 --> 09:11.390
Okay, yeah. That's, um...

09:11.469 --> 09:13.299
- Cool. Everything's cool.
- Call me.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.867
We'll lock down

09:14.868 --> 09:16.347
quantities and pricing.

09:16.432 --> 09:17.767
Okay! Thank you,

09:17.768 --> 09:19.102
I'll be in touch.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.354
- (Whispering)
- Holy fuck!

09:20.436 --> 09:22.096
Ricky!

09:22.187 --> 09:23.187
Ricky, do you know what

09:23.188 --> 09:24.188
just happened here?

09:24.273 --> 09:25.403
You don't think

09:25.404 --> 09:26.433
we're not dumb for

09:26.673 --> 09:27.333
not taking the 5 grand?

09:27.408 --> 09:28.895
- No, Ricky. This is.
- Next level shit.

09:28.919 --> 09:30.279
- I could be next.
- Chef Boyardee!

09:30.737 --> 09:31.797
This is a good idea!

09:32.281 --> 09:33.656
Was it my idea

09:33.657 --> 09:35.031
or was it Julian's?

09:35.117 --> 09:36.742
No, it was Julian's idea

09:36.743 --> 09:38.367
but you came up with it!

09:38.454 --> 09:39.664
- Cool!
- (Giggling)

09:42.166 --> 09:44.206
Oh, way to go, Randy...

09:44.293 --> 09:45.673
How to make a mountain

09:45.674 --> 09:47.053
out off a shit-molehill.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.589
(Dog barking)

09:48.672 --> 09:50.172
Suspect is in custody, sir.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.776
- Let's get him in.
- The back of the car.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.944
- And we'll take him.
- Down to the station.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.428
That's enough, Randy.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.262
- Mr. Lahey, we're.
- Taking him downtown.

09:56.347 --> 09:58.057
Randy, for - the love of God,

09:58.140 --> 09:59.617
- What the hell's.
- The matter with you?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.271
Public intoxication!

10:01.352 --> 10:03.022
Randy, it's Donnie!

10:03.103 --> 10:04.363
Haul him up - on the porch,

10:04.438 --> 10:05.523
Throw his barbecue

10:05.524 --> 10:06.608
cover over him.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.293
- Look, this has been.
- Going on for 18 years.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.957
- Why would we start.
- Arresting him now?

10:12.488 --> 10:13.928
Randy, look,

10:13.929 --> 10:14.968
I know it's great

10:14.988 --> 10:16.068
to have dreams, bud.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.194
But... but this is

10:17.195 --> 10:18.839
getting way out of hand.

10:18.927 --> 10:22.177
This... stupid uniform.

10:22.264 --> 10:23.494
And this, that's

10:23.595 --> 10:24.595
even stupider.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.228
It looks like a

10:26.229 --> 10:27.748
coin-operated carnival

10:27.808 --> 10:29.148
shit-car, Randy!

10:31.298 --> 10:32.588
(Grunt)

10:32.674 --> 10:34.514
- There are way more.
- Factors at play here.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.183
Than you're - aware of, Sir.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.101
- And if I become.
- A real police officer,

10:38.180 --> 10:39.450
I'm not standing for

10:39.451 --> 10:40.720
any of this shit!

10:40.807 --> 10:42.372
Randy, you have no idea

10:42.373 --> 10:43.937
how difficult it is

10:44.019 --> 10:45.559
- to become an officer.
- Of the law.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.435
No idea at all!

10:47.523 --> 10:48.903
First Ricky,

10:48.904 --> 10:50.283
now Donnie.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.939
Why are you so soft?

10:52.027 --> 10:53.607
Why am I so soft?

10:53.695 --> 10:55.605
Randy, I'm not - fucking soft!

10:55.697 --> 10:57.617
- Look, Julian's.
- Left the park.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.074
Ricky's really easy

10:59.075 --> 11:00.049
to get along with.

10:58.899 --> 11:00.535
He's gone legit.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.286
Why would we start

11:02.287 --> 11:04.036
slinging shit-balls

11:00.536 --> 11:04.036
at the shit-hive

11:04.122 --> 11:05.457
when the shitty little

11:05.458 --> 11:06.792
bees aren't stinging us?

11:06.875 --> 11:07.935
Well, I'm trying

11:07.936 --> 11:09.062
to get rid of the frigging shit-hive.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.916
So we never get stung.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.256
Back away, Mr. Lahey.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.296
I'm backing up.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.715
(Engine revving)

11:24.643 --> 11:26.483
- Holy fuck, we're.
- Going to party, Bubs!

11:26.562 --> 11:27.752
I feel like driving

11:27.753 --> 11:28.998
a Roman candle right up my fucking ass!

11:29.022 --> 11:30.107
No, Ricky, you're not

11:30.108 --> 11:31.192
doing that again.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.650
It's too dangerous.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.025
Every time you do it,

11:34.111 --> 11:35.361
who gets stuck putting

11:35.362 --> 11:36.611
the ointment on you? Me!

11:36.696 --> 11:38.006
Fuck! This fucking

11:38.007 --> 11:39.316
puppy's still here!

11:39.408 --> 11:41.010
- Oh, they're lucky.
- That's not a kitty.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.099
I would start fucking

11:42.100 --> 11:43.164
wrecking this place!

11:43.245 --> 11:44.805
- Who's the fucking idiot.
- That owns this car?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.099
You're going to cook

11:46.100 --> 11:47.369
the little fucker inside!

11:47.458 --> 11:49.352
- Get the fuck out here!
- I'm going to break into it,

11:49.376 --> 11:51.666
In five, four,

11:51.667 --> 11:53.956
three, two, one...

11:54.047 --> 11:55.627
Fuck you, then.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.193
- Hang on, little buddy.
- I'll help you out.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.257
Ricky, where did you

11:58.258 --> 11:59.297
get a slim jim?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.462
Always got one on me, Bubs.

12:00.486 --> 12:01.766
You never know when you need it.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.155
There we go.

12:03.314 --> 12:04.314
Here, hold that.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.620
Come here.

12:05.621 --> 12:06.765
Oh my God, are you okay?

12:06.851 --> 12:08.206
Are you just taking him?

12:08.207 --> 12:09.561
There. You're cool now.

12:09.647 --> 12:10.732
Holy fuck,

12:10.733 --> 12:11.817
that's a good name.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.728
What? "Coolnow"?

12:13.817 --> 12:14.922
You can't name

12:14.923 --> 12:16.027
a fucking animal.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.301
I didn't.

12:17.302 --> 12:18.491
What just happened did.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.757
What are you - talking about?

12:19.781 --> 12:21.331
Well, two seconds ago

12:21.408 --> 12:23.136
- he was overheating.
- In this <i> asshole's car!</i>

12:23.160 --> 12:24.245
But now, he's cool.

12:24.246 --> 12:25.330
He's Coolnow.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.372
It's fucking perfect.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.866
You are so fucked, Ricky.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.333
Anyway, the SPCA'll

12:31.334 --> 12:32.708
give him a new name.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.214
He'll be fine.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.006
Fuck, I wonder if.

12:36.007 --> 12:37.716
Mo would like him.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.094
Ricky, you're not taking

12:39.095 --> 12:40.389
him back to the park.

12:40.469 --> 12:41.844
I don't need a fucking

12:41.845 --> 12:43.219
long, skinny dog

12:43.305 --> 12:44.755
fucking with my kitties.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.928
It's not happening.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.401
- Bubbles:
- Thank you very much, Lonnie.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.900
Thank you. Listen, everybody.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.901
I just want to say I appreciate

12:54.983 --> 12:56.008
all the congratulations

12:56.009 --> 12:57.086
and everything you're giving me.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.900
- But I want.
- Everybody to know:

12:58.987 --> 13:00.342
This wasn't all me.

13:00.343 --> 13:01.757
Ricky played a huge part in all this.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.241
And everybody here,

13:03.242 --> 13:04.760
you know, everybody who
grew the ingredients.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.304
- And one of the reasons.
- We're here...

13:06.328 --> 13:07.453
Well, Ricky,

13:07.454 --> 13:08.578
maybe you should...

13:08.664 --> 13:09.874
(Quietly)

13:09.875 --> 13:11.142
say what you're going to say
before the liquor runs out.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.166
Here, Cory.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.227
Cory, let's go. Get the
fuck out of the way.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.751
Let's go!

13:14.836 --> 13:16.836
- Jesus, you're always.
- In the fucking way, Cory.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.483
- Hey, everyone,
- what the fuck's going on?

13:18.507 --> 13:19.717
(Mixed muttering)

13:19.718 --> 13:20.927
Most of you probably know,

13:21.009 --> 13:22.114
the reason why we're

13:22.115 --> 13:23.279
eating and drinking for fucking free today.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.453
Is 'cause we're about

13:24.454 --> 13:25.657
to sign a huge contract
for the pizza sauce.

13:25.681 --> 13:28.231
(Cheering, applause)

13:28.308 --> 13:29.518
That means we need to grow

13:29.519 --> 13:30.728
a fuck-ton more vegetables.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.530
- So... I wonder.
- If there's anybody here.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.248
- That wants to help us grow.
- Some fucking vegetables?

13:34.272 --> 13:36.232
- Yeah!
- Aw, fuck that, man.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.481
You already burned

13:37.482 --> 13:38.712
your own goddamn trailer
to the ground! Look...

13:38.736 --> 13:39.921
Yeah! Fuck that, man!

13:39.922 --> 13:41.106
It's too risky.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.341
And it's illegal!

13:42.342 --> 13:43.486
It's not illegal!

13:43.574 --> 13:44.619
You're only going

13:44.620 --> 13:45.719
to be growing vegetables, that's it.

13:45.743 --> 13:47.018
Fucking idiot.

13:47.019 --> 13:48.346
And it's not dangerous, Marguerite.
I promise.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.765
I'll do all the

13:49.766 --> 13:51.224
wiring on the tables myself, you know.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.708
I could do the wiring.

13:52.791 --> 13:53.811
No, Ricky,

13:53.812 --> 13:54.831
I'll do the wiring.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.878
It's not a problem. Look...

13:56.961 --> 13:58.111
I mean, we can get the

13:58.112 --> 13:59.261
stuff growing anywhere

13:59.339 --> 14:00.859
but that wasn't the point,

14:00.860 --> 14:02.380
we wanted to keep it in the park here,

14:02.467 --> 14:04.007
You know, because..

14:04.008 --> 14:05.547
'Cause we're all like family.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.907
That's right, Bubs.

14:06.908 --> 14:08.177
I just need 15, 20 people

14:08.265 --> 14:09.700
to help me realize

14:09.701 --> 14:11.135
a lifelong dream here.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.476
So what do you say, please?

14:13.562 --> 14:14.562
Did I mention

14:14.563 --> 14:15.623
you're going to make a shit-ton of cash?

14:15.647 --> 14:16.667
I'm in.

14:16.668 --> 14:17.687
I'm in, too.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.380
Right on!

14:19.381 --> 14:20.185
All right!

14:20.275 --> 14:21.285
(Laughter)

14:21.369 --> 14:22.369
Oh, boys!

14:22.571 --> 14:24.951
(Muffled hip hop music)

14:25.031 --> 14:26.991
(Music)

14:27.075 --> 14:28.405
- Oh shit!
- Hey, guys.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.498
I need to buy

14:29.499 --> 14:30.503
a cellphone.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.099
One that's got

14:32.100 --> 14:33.619
a stolen sim card and shoots in HD.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.747
Fuck, man, I don't

14:34.748 --> 14:35.851
know what you're talking about.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.915
All we do is fix phones

14:36.916 --> 14:38.020
and screens and shit up in this mah.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.279

14:39.280 --> 14:40.514

14:40.589 --> 14:42.549

Killin' it too.

14:51.768 --> 14:53.102
We do repairs on screens.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.564

15:14.247 --> 15:15.617
Come on, - give me a phone.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.561

15:18.585 --> 15:20.165
You ain't got - shit on us.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.633
I get it. The shirt.

15:22.714 --> 15:23.790
Shirts can be intimidating,

15:23.814 --> 15:24.814
Can't they?

15:24.842 --> 15:26.302
- Yeah? Well,

15:26.384 --> 15:28.304
Look, it's - just me, Randy.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.288
♪ Gut-formers,

15:31.289 --> 15:32.563
Randy's in disguise ♪

15:32.641 --> 15:34.271
- (Laughter)
- Frig off, Tyrone.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.951
- What'd you blow.
- A hose or something?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.597
It's all oily!

15:37.688 --> 15:39.308
- Get it? Because.
- He's a machine.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.897
No. You blew that.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.028
No, no, no.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.128
Optimus Prime Rib! (Laughter)

15:44.152 --> 15:45.322
That's all that is.

15:45.323 --> 15:46.547
That's all rib in that mothafucker!

15:46.571 --> 15:48.341
- Frig off! - All rib in.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.470
Frig off!

15:49.471 --> 15:50.635
Do you want to go?
(Mixed shouting)

15:50.659 --> 15:52.409
- Do you want me.
- To put you down?

15:52.494 --> 15:53.971
- I came here for - a friggin' phone,
- All right?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.389
- No, man, you can't.
- Have no phone.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.543
(Mixed shouting)

15:57.624 --> 15:59.609
You got tons of phones!

15:59.610 --> 16:01.594
Give me a friggin' phone! Frig!

16:01.670 --> 16:03.420
(Grunting)

16:03.505 --> 16:04.630
I got a phone, okay?

16:04.631 --> 16:05.755
Right here.

16:05.841 --> 16:06.966
All right?

16:06.967 --> 16:08.091
That's all I wanted.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.236
You guys have got

16:09.237 --> 16:10.363
to take me serious
from now on, okay?

16:10.387 --> 16:11.532
I'm not friggin' around.

16:11.533 --> 16:12.677
T, put this on my tab.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.524
- Listen, ain't nobody.
- Taking you serious.

16:14.558 --> 16:15.578
When you dress like.

16:15.579 --> 16:16.598
Robo-fucking-gutcop.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.525
- Get the fuck - out of here, man.
- (Laughter)

16:19.938 --> 16:21.518
- Fuck. Thanks for.
- Driving, Ricky.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.366
- I'm definitely over.
- I think I had, like,

16:23.400 --> 16:25.320
- Three too many beers.
- Yeah, me too, buddy.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.742
(Phone rings)

16:28.822 --> 16:29.992
Skip. Who the fuck's

16:29.993 --> 16:31.217
this Skip idiot who
keeps calling me?

16:31.241 --> 16:32.951
- I don't even know.
- A fucking Skip!

16:33.034 --> 16:34.929
- Fuck off! I'm going - to throw this phone.
- Out the window.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.623
- And fucking smash it.
- Ricky!

16:36.705 --> 16:37.785
Do not smash another

16:37.786 --> 16:38.865
fucking phone, please.

16:38.957 --> 16:39.957
You need to be

16:39.958 --> 16:40.958
reachable at all times.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.462
(Car squeaking)

16:42.463 --> 16:43.938
Man, that fucking squeak
will drive me nuts.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.902
Just give it a shot

16:45.903 --> 16:47.842
of WD-30, that would fix it right up.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.280
WD-30?

16:49.281 --> 16:50.635
What's that, Ricky?

16:50.719 --> 16:51.909
How the fuck

16:51.910 --> 16:53.155
do you not know what WD-30 is, man?

16:53.179 --> 16:54.969
- Especially a guy.
- Who works on carts.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.296
- What do you use?
- 5-in-1 oil?

16:57.976 --> 17:00.226
No, I think

17:00.227 --> 17:02.476
I've got some...

17:02.564 --> 17:04.273
WD-40 here, Ricky.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.521
But I've never

17:05.522 --> 17:06.686
heard of WD-30.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.027
I've got some

17:08.028 --> 17:09.308
10W30 oil behind the seat there.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.242
- But...
- (Laughs)

17:11.321 --> 17:12.842
- I mean, that's - not the stuff.
- I'm talking about.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.300
- That works pretty good.
- But WD-30's way better.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.990
It's in a different

17:15.991 --> 17:17.655
coloured can.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.156
Anyway...

17:19.247 --> 17:20.707
Look, we've got to talk

17:20.790 --> 17:21.896
about this whole fucking

17:21.896 --> 17:23.001
hockey school thing.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.464
You know, with this

17:24.464 --> 17:25.844
pizza sauce business,

17:25.921 --> 17:27.131
I don't think there's

17:27.132 --> 17:28.398
going to be time
to do both, bud.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.553
I don't think there's

17:29.554 --> 17:30.735
going to be time to
run a hockey school.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.089
- (Sighs)
- I know.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.529
- You're right, I guess.
- It just sucks.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.103
- I mean, I put up.
- All those flyers,

17:35.179 --> 17:36.939
- And I was kind of.
- Looking forward to it.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.394
Because we've been doing

17:39.395 --> 17:40.439
so well lately,

17:40.518 --> 17:41.728
I thought, like, maybe

17:41.729 --> 17:42.997
it was time to give back, to the kids.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.211
So I decided to come up

17:44.212 --> 17:45.458
with the idea to start
a ball hockey camp.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.082
- I can rent the rink.
- For $300 a week.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.173
And charge the parents

17:48.174 --> 17:49.238
$100 a week per kid.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.799
As long as I get

17:50.800 --> 17:52.339
four kids per week, it's
no fucking brainier.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.243
All right, let's see

17:54.324 --> 17:55.329
if you can make a simple

17:55.330 --> 17:56.385
fucking phone call
today, you asshole!

17:56.409 --> 17:58.159
Ricky, phones

17:58.160 --> 17:59.909
can't be assholes.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.102
Hey, Darren. It's Ricky.

18:01.103 --> 18:02.207
I got some bad news, man.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.143
- I'm going to - have to cancel.
- Not enough interest.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.352
So I'll need that

18:05.353 --> 18:06.537
deposit back.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.668
No fucking way, it worked?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.416
Oh, fuck you, Darren!

18:11.508 --> 18:12.613
That's fucking bullshit!

18:12.614 --> 18:13.718
Fuck's sakes! What?

18:13.802 --> 18:14.992
He says if I don't

18:14.993 --> 18:16.238
put on the hockey camp, I
don't get my deposit back.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.824
- I guess the fucking phone's.
- Been ringing off the hook.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.118
With people asking about.

18:19.119 --> 18:20.388
Gretzky and Coffey.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.580
Gretzky and Coffey?

18:21.581 --> 18:22.685
What are you talking about?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.649
A brilliant market-ling.

18:24.729 --> 18:25.814
I put on the flyer

18:25.815 --> 18:26.958
that they might drop
by at the hockey camp.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.607
Who might drop by?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.232
Wayne Gretzky and Paul Coffey?

18:30.318 --> 18:31.633
Ricky, Jesus. You'd

18:31.634 --> 18:33.006
never get those guys
to your hockey school,

18:33.030 --> 18:34.610
- Not to mention.
- That's illegal.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.068
- No, it's not.
- It is!

18:36.157 --> 18:37.477
- I said,
- "possible appearance".

18:37.534 --> 18:38.744
It's false advertising.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.304
- Well, they're.
- Going to be in town.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.931
- For some fucking fancy.
- Rich guy idiot dinner,

18:41.955 --> 18:42.975
So I'll get a hold

18:42.976 --> 18:43.995
of them, see if they

18:41.955 --> 18:43.995
want to drop by.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.627
If they don't,

18:45.628 --> 18:47.172
they look like

18:44.082 --> 18:47.172
dicks, not me.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.711
Oh, my fuck.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.281
I don't know why

18:53.282 --> 18:54.931
you go on these

18:51.631 --> 18:54.931
stupid ride-alongs.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.510
It's never going to...

18:56.594 --> 18:58.322
- get you any closer.
- To being on the force.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.096
You're wrong, Mr. Lahey.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.101
You have no idea.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.494
- This is going.
- To help me more.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.188
Than you can - ever imagine.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.189
- Ted's a fucking idiot.
- (Car horn honking)

19:07.271 --> 19:08.751
- And he's a shitty.
- Police officer.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.320
Sometimes a man's gotta do

19:16.321 --> 19:17.735
what a man's gotta do,

19:17.824 --> 19:19.834
to get what he wants.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.870
Okay, I'm about to get in the

19:23.871 --> 19:25.495
car with Officer Ted Johnson,

19:25.582 --> 19:26.792
who invited me to go

19:26.793 --> 19:28.002
on a ride-along.

19:35.550 --> 19:36.740
Hey, Ted.

19:36.741 --> 19:37.930
What you up to?

19:38.011 --> 19:39.931
- Oh, you know what.
- I'm up to, Randy.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.103
Get in the car.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.181
I was thinking maybe

19:43.182 --> 19:44.181
you could take me

19:42.181 --> 19:44.181
shooting this week.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.372
I know how to shoot,

19:45.373 --> 19:46.477
but not very well.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.481
We might be able to do that.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.233
First though,

19:50.314 --> 19:51.399
I'd like to do a little

19:51.400 --> 19:52.484
"shooting" of my own.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.817
Know what I mean?

19:55.445 --> 19:56.735
Bubbles:

19:56.736 --> 19:58.025
Ricky, slow the fuck down.

19:58.115 --> 20:00.485
- Jesus Murphy!
- This truck's not built for that.

20:00.575 --> 20:01.970
That was awesome, Bubs.

20:01.971 --> 20:03.365
I'm sorry, man,
it's a fork habit.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.498
Reggie loves that shit

20:04.499 --> 20:05.543
when I slide in.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.897
Well, I don't.

20:06.898 --> 20:08.225
You're gonna break the fucking thing.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.879
Jesus Murphy!

20:09.960 --> 20:12.210
Oh, look at that beaut.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.750
Ricky:

20:13.751 --> 20:15.274
Be a lot nicer if it had
some fucking tires on it.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.423
No, Ricky,

20:16.424 --> 20:17.548
the... cart.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.144
Ricky: - Reg!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.928
- Right on, man.
- Look at all the tables.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.432
Ricky, look,

20:22.433 --> 20:23.908
that's a 1600 series
from the mid-'70s.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.392
You do not see

20:25.393 --> 20:26.852
those babies anymore.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.060
It's a fucking

20:28.061 --> 20:29.185
piece of shit. Who cares?

20:29.270 --> 20:30.810
It's a fucking beauty!

20:30.897 --> 20:32.627
Is what that is.

20:32.628 --> 20:34.357
All hand-welded.

20:34.442 --> 20:35.757
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

20:35.758 --> 20:37.072
(Dog barking)

20:37.154 --> 20:39.034
- All right, well,
- worst case scenario,

20:39.114 --> 20:40.139
We're waiting

20:40.140 --> 20:41.164
for an hour. Maybe.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.260
Or if something happened, - he could
have left - That fucking days ago.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.494
And got dead or something.

20:44.495 --> 20:45.704
You never know.

20:45.787 --> 20:46.912
Ricky, how does your

20:46.913 --> 20:48.037
brain come up with that?

20:48.123 --> 20:50.143
Well, I'm just saying, - like, the
fucking sign - Can't predict the future.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.272
Neither can a people.

20:51.273 --> 20:52.436
Something could have
fucking happened to him.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.855
That's all I'm saying.

20:53.856 --> 20:55.250
We could be waiting here for days.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.443
My God... All right.

20:56.444 --> 20:57.608
Well, I guess that makes sense.

20:57.632 --> 20:59.443
- Well, you know what?
- Just back the truck up.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.507
Me and Reggie go way back.

21:00.508 --> 21:01.547
We'll take the tables.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.447
If he didn't get dead, - we'll
fucking pay - For them tomorrow.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.141
- Will he be.
- All right with that?

21:05.223 --> 21:06.498
Yes, man!

21:06.499 --> 21:07.773
It's the Reg! (Phone ringing)

21:07.851 --> 21:09.226
(Sigh)

21:09.227 --> 21:10.601
Fucking... oh, my fuck!
Skip again!

21:10.687 --> 21:12.102
Fuck you, Skip!

21:12.103 --> 21:13.582
Stop calling my fucking phone, you asshole!

21:13.606 --> 21:15.476
- Ricky, why don't.
- You just answer it.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.731
And ask him who he is

21:16.732 --> 21:17.962
like a fucking normal person would do?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.151
'Cause it's some

21:19.152 --> 21:20.380
little fucking asshole
that's fucking with me!

21:20.404 --> 21:22.074
He never leaves a message,

21:22.075 --> 21:23.801
just likes to call me up
and fucking annoy me!

21:23.825 --> 21:24.845
Yeah, I'm sure

21:24.846 --> 21:25.865
that's what Skip's doin'.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.540
Randy, you did an

21:32.541 --> 21:34.165
exceptional job today.

21:34.252 --> 21:36.172
- You're really working.
- Hard for this.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.279
I never wanted

21:38.280 --> 21:40.304
anything more in my
whole life, Ted.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.823
Listen, I got

21:41.824 --> 21:43.263
a new cellphone. Oh, yeah?

21:43.344 --> 21:45.280
- I was wondering - if you could put.
- Your email address.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.764
- And your contact.
- Information.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.348
- Yeah, I could.
- Do that for you.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.975
Drop me a line

21:52.976 --> 21:55.015
when you want to do some more... training.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.166
I'll definitely

21:56.167 --> 21:57.226
be contacting you.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.215
(Dog barking)

22:01.216 --> 22:02.235
(Grunt)

22:02.321 --> 22:03.661
All right, Ricky.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.950
No more fucking power slides.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.619
She's as top heavy

22:07.620 --> 22:09.204
as Dolly Parton
up a flag pole now.

22:09.287 --> 22:10.392
No worries, buddy.

22:10.393 --> 22:11.557
Let's get the fuck back
to the trailer park.

22:11.581 --> 22:12.850
- And get these little.
- Babies set up.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.504
Just take it easy.

22:14.584 --> 22:15.754
I'll try. Fuck...

22:23.927 --> 22:25.032
(Second vehicle

22:25.033 --> 22:26.137
(approaching)

22:29.599 --> 22:30.954
in the fuck?

22:30.955 --> 22:32.309
Racoon fucking fucks!

22:32.393 --> 22:34.653
(Gunshots)

22:34.729 --> 22:35.729
Fuck!

22:37.523 --> 22:39.783
(Engine ignition)

22:46.407 --> 22:49.487
(Gunshots)

22:49.577 --> 22:50.702
Jesus Christ!

22:50.703 --> 22:51.827
Jesus fuck! What was that?

22:51.913 --> 22:53.083
(Gunshots)

22:53.084 --> 22:54.308
Who's shooting at us?
Steven Avery?

22:54.332 --> 22:56.172
- Reggie:
- I will fuck you the fuck up.

22:56.251 --> 22:57.376
Is that Reggie?

22:57.377 --> 22:58.562
Reggie, it's me, you fucking idiot!

22:58.586 --> 23:00.336
- Stop fucking firing!
- (Gunshots continue)

23:00.421 --> 23:02.171
(Scream)

23:02.257 --> 23:03.757
Ricky, what's his number?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.591
773-JUNK.

23:05.676 --> 23:06.861
(Gunshot)

23:06.862 --> 23:08.046
Fuck off!

23:08.138 --> 23:09.558
- Bubbles:
- There, it's ringing.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.099
- Reggie: (On phone)
- Yeah?

23:11.182 --> 23:13.102
- Ricky: Hey, pistol-cock! - It's Ricky!
- What?

23:13.184 --> 23:14.912
Are you firing your - fucking
hand-cannon at - A little white truck?

23:14.936 --> 23:16.247
- What the fuck are.
- You talking about?

23:16.271 --> 23:17.861
- Yeah, well, that's.
- Me and Bubbles,

23:17.939 --> 23:19.792
- You fucking slutty,
- horny fucking moose bitch!

23:19.816 --> 23:21.936
Pull the fuck over!

23:22.026 --> 23:23.946
- Bubbles: - Christ, Ricky!
- Ricky: Fuck.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.133
Why do you hang out

23:25.134 --> 23:26.299
with that fucking crazy bastard?

23:26.323 --> 23:28.123
- He's fucked!
- Do you think?

23:30.451 --> 23:31.701
What the fuck, man?

23:31.702 --> 23:32.951
What the fuck,

23:33.037 --> 23:34.787
you fucking - bunny blower!

23:34.872 --> 23:36.207
Jeez, that was bat-fuck

23:36.208 --> 23:37.542
fucked up back there.

23:37.625 --> 23:38.855
I'm glad we didn't fucking

23:38.856 --> 23:40.146
shoot each other, cock-shaver!
No shit.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.420
I kind of didn't

23:41.421 --> 23:42.731
recogni... When did you
get this piece of shit?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.375
It's Bubbles' - piece of shit.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.545
It's not a piece of shit.

23:46.634 --> 23:47.659
It's a fucking

23:47.660 --> 23:48.737
wonderful little truck.
It's very practical.

23:48.761 --> 23:49.866
Sorry, man. We needed

23:49.867 --> 23:51.031
these fucking tables
and lights today.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.325
- And figured we'd just.
- Pay you tomorrow.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.869
- Pay me whenever.
- You want, Shylock.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.083
Just don't fuck me over

23:55.084 --> 23:56.233
like your pal Julian did

23:56.311 --> 23:57.356
with that fucking

23:57.357 --> 23:58.401
container I got him.

23:58.479 --> 23:59.899
- Julian?
- Julian's out west.

23:59.981 --> 24:01.481
- Working in the oil fields.
- Yeah.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.355
No, no, no. Julian?

24:03.442 --> 24:05.212
- Julian's living - in a container.
- Down by the wharf.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.671
He's trawling for

24:06.672 --> 24:08.106
fucking lobsters right now.

24:08.198 --> 24:10.408
What?

24:10.491 --> 24:12.469
- You've got to be - yanking my cock with.
- A pair of vise grips.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.083
- Hey, Ted.
- Did you get my email?

24:15.997 --> 24:17.602
No, you listen to me!

24:17.603 --> 24:19.207
That was just a small clip.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.252
- Unless you want the.
- Whole video to go public,

24:21.294 --> 24:23.774
- I suggest you do everything.
- To get me on the police force.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.377
I'm dead serious.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.596
- Yeah, tomorrow.
- Morning works great.

24:31.679 --> 24:32.929
All right, see you then.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.064
(Beep)

24:42.565 --> 24:44.185
Julian?

24:46.861 --> 24:48.911
(Sigh)

24:50.448 --> 24:51.818
Do you guys want a drink?

24:57.580 --> 24:58.645
How many years have we

24:58.646 --> 24:59.710
been friends, Julian?

24:59.790 --> 25:01.210
How many fucking years?

25:01.211 --> 25:02.686
And you just cut us out of your life.

25:02.710 --> 25:03.775
Yeah, man.

25:03.776 --> 25:04.840
What the fuck? Real nice.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.399
- So this is where.
- You're living now?

25:06.423 --> 25:08.013
It's quite the - fucking spot.

25:08.091 --> 25:09.801
- (Door creaking)
- Look out, Bubs.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.032
Holy fuck!

25:13.033 --> 25:14.512
Come on in, boys.

25:14.597 --> 25:15.912
You give me one

25:15.913 --> 25:17.227
good goddamn reason, Julian,

25:17.308 --> 25:18.373
Why you've been

25:18.374 --> 25:19.494
living so fucking close to us.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.978
And you didn't come

25:20.979 --> 25:22.438
and see us, not once!

25:22.521 --> 25:23.796
Because you're better

25:23.797 --> 25:25.071
off without me, man. Oh, yeah.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.819
- I've been keeping.
- Tabs on you guys.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.256
Congratulations on the

25:28.257 --> 25:29.611
pizza sauce company, man.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.360
I'm very proud of you guys.

25:31.361 --> 25:33.025
I'm happy for you.

25:33.116 --> 25:35.052
- I didn't know you knew.
- About that. Thank you.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.946
- It's fucking.
- Great, actually.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.931
We're about to sign - a fucking
contract with - A big pizza chain.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.615
See? That's - fantastic, guys!

25:40.706 --> 25:42.496
Yeah, it <i> is</i> fantastic.

25:42.583 --> 25:43.838
The problem is,

25:43.839 --> 25:45.093
you know, to meet demands,

25:45.169 --> 25:46.980
- We've got to take.
- Things to the next level.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.009
And I'm not sure we're

25:48.010 --> 25:49.014
capable of doing that.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.965
So... why don't you just

25:50.966 --> 25:52.840
move back to the park

25:52.927 --> 25:54.282
join the company,

25:54.283 --> 25:55.697
and you can oversee the expansion project.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.681
- Because, Bubs,
- me being on my own.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.515
- Is the best thing.
- For us, man.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.020
I've got everything I need.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.253
How much money are we

26:03.254 --> 26:04.403
talking about anyway?

26:04.481 --> 26:05.671
I don't know

26:05.672 --> 26:06.861
exactly, but...

26:06.941 --> 26:08.591
I think it's in the

26:08.592 --> 26:10.296
ballpark of a thousand bucks each, a month.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.510
(Chuckling)

26:11.511 --> 26:12.700
(Phone ringing)

26:12.780 --> 26:13.825
I really appreciate

26:13.826 --> 26:14.925
you guys thinking about me, but I can't.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.014
What the fuck...

26:16.015 --> 26:17.079
(Ringing)

26:17.160 --> 26:18.265
Oh, my fuck, this

26:18.266 --> 26:19.370
fucking Skip shit...

26:19.454 --> 26:21.124
- Fucking Skip! Fuck!
- Rick! Rick! Rick!

26:21.205 --> 26:22.455
Rick! Do not throw

26:22.456 --> 26:23.705
that fucking phone!

26:23.791 --> 26:25.066
Why do you keep

26:25.067 --> 26:26.341
saying "Skip"?

26:26.419 --> 26:27.899
It's Skype! You're

26:27.900 --> 26:29.379
getting a Skype call.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.424
- Answer it.
- What does that mean?

26:31.508 --> 26:32.863
It's Snoop Dogg!

26:32.864 --> 26:34.218
Fuck! Hey!

26:34.302 --> 26:35.762
<i>Say, man. Why the fuck you</i>

26:35.763 --> 26:37.222
<i>brushing a motherfucka off?</i>

26:37.305 --> 26:38.865
- I'm sorry, man. - I'm fucking still.
- Trying to figure out.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.719
- How to work these.
- Goddamn brain-phones.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.098
<i>I'm hitting you up</i>

26:42.099 --> 26:43.388
<i>for a real reason, man.</i>

26:43.478 --> 26:45.398
<i>That 5-hour de-energy drink,</i>

26:45.480 --> 26:46.650
<i>that shit is catching on</i>

26:46.651 --> 26:47.820
<i>in Cali, man.</i>

26:47.898 --> 26:49.568
<i>It's liquid gold.</i>

26:49.650 --> 26:51.378
<i>- And motherfuckers'll.
- Pay anything for it.</i>

26:51.402 --> 26:52.992
<i>Now here's the real question:</i>

26:53.070 --> 26:54.910
<i>Can you hook your cousin up?</i>

26:54.989 --> 26:56.800
- (Sigh) - Fuck, man, I wish.
- I've got none left.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.469
- And I'm not growing dope.
- Anymore, so I can't.

26:58.493 --> 26:59.683
How much are you talking

26:59.684 --> 27:00.873
about here, Snoop?

27:00.953 --> 27:02.103
<i>Well, I was thinking</i>

27:02.104 --> 27:03.307
<i>about setting up a deal
with Mary Jane's,</i>

27:03.331 --> 27:04.456
<i>You know, for, like,</i>

27:04.457 --> 27:05.642
<i>you know, what?
30,000 bottles, maybe.</i>

27:05.666 --> 27:07.021
30,000!

27:07.022 --> 27:08.376
(Chuckle)

27:08.461 --> 27:09.861
How much a bottle?

27:09.862 --> 27:11.261
<i>Now hold the fuck on.</i>

27:11.339 --> 27:12.629
<i>How soon would I</i>

27:12.630 --> 27:13.919
<i>get the delivery?</i>

27:14.008 --> 27:15.588
- (Sigh)
- Fuck, it'd take...

27:15.676 --> 27:17.086
43 days to grow the dope,

27:17.178 --> 27:18.822
- and then a week to fucking.
- Dry it and make it.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.636
So... it'd be 50...

27:20.723 --> 27:22.078
45 days, man.

27:22.079 --> 27:23.433
<i>Damn!</i>

27:23.518 --> 27:25.598
<i>- That's some quick turnaround.
- Shit right there.</i>

27:25.686 --> 27:27.606
<i>Seven bucks per motherfucka.</i>

27:27.688 --> 27:29.858
No, how about 10 US,

27:29.940 --> 27:30.960
plus you're in charge

27:30.961 --> 27:31.980
of the transpo. Deal?

27:32.068 --> 27:33.778
(Exhaling)

27:33.861 --> 27:35.611
<i>Shit. Done deal.</i>

27:35.696 --> 27:36.966
<i>That's the way this</i>

27:36.967 --> 27:38.236
<i>motherfucka rolls.</i>

27:38.324 --> 27:39.474
<i>I'mma holler at y'all</i>

27:39.475 --> 27:40.677
<i>in a few weeks so we
can set this shit up.</i>

27:40.701 --> 27:42.621
- <i>I'm gone.</i>
- (Beep)

27:42.703 --> 27:43.913
Holy fuck!

27:43.914 --> 27:45.123
A deal? A <i> deal?</i>

27:47.833 --> 27:49.293
Boys, forget - what I said.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.087
- I'm going to run.
- Your company.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.939
- But it's not going - to be a fucking.
- Pizza sauce company.

27:52.963 --> 27:54.048
Are you out of your

27:54.049 --> 27:55.133
fucking mind?

27:55.216 --> 27:57.236
- That's not happening, - Julian, not a chance!
- (Liquid trickling)

27:57.260 --> 27:59.196
- Bubs, you're already - set up to grow.
- Right now, man!

27:59.220 --> 28:00.575
Like, how long is

28:00.576 --> 28:01.930
it going to take? What, 43 days?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.309
After 43 days

28:03.310 --> 28:04.659
you can get back into making pizza sauce.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.643
- Rick, how many plants.
- Are we talking?

28:06.727 --> 28:07.917
Off the top of my head,

28:07.918 --> 28:09.107
between... 2 and 500.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.832
- But we probably do.
- Have enough tables.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.376
Ricky, you're not taking

28:12.377 --> 28:13.896
our fucking business

28:13.984 --> 28:15.719
and turning it into

28:15.720 --> 28:17.454
a goddamn weed factory!
(Toilet flushing)

28:17.530 --> 28:19.260
Bubs, it's 400,000

28:19.261 --> 28:20.990
Canadian almost!

28:21.075 --> 28:22.405
Think about it.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.912
Think about it!

28:25.996 --> 28:27.916
I don't give - a fuck, Julian!

28:27.998 --> 28:28.998
I don't give a fuck

28:28.999 --> 28:30.060
about the money!
Bubs, come on, man!

28:30.084 --> 28:31.294
I've fucking missed

28:31.295 --> 28:32.563
you guys! I want to be
hanging out with you guys.

28:32.587 --> 28:34.232
Oh, yeah, you missed us

28:34.233 --> 28:35.941
so much now that there's fucking...
a bunch of money!

28:35.965 --> 28:37.545
"Oh, I've missed you guys!"

28:37.634 --> 28:38.739
I don't give a fuck

28:38.740 --> 28:39.844
about the money, Julian.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.507
It's fucking illegal.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.506
- Bubs, think about the.
- Cat food you can buy.

28:43.598 --> 28:44.888
Think about all

28:44.889 --> 28:46.243
those vet bills that
you can easily pay for.

28:46.267 --> 28:48.017
- For the rest of.
- Your fucking life.

28:48.102 --> 28:49.147
It's a fucking

28:49.148 --> 28:50.192
shit-ton of money, Bubs.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.376
And no one would

28:51.377 --> 28:52.541
suspect a fucking thing, either.

28:52.565 --> 28:53.960
Come on, man.

28:53.961 --> 28:55.355
We'd be a team again.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.153
(Whimpering)

28:57.154 --> 28:58.863
Bubs, come on!

28:58.946 --> 29:00.361
Who's got your

29:00.362 --> 29:01.776
$133,000 belly, huh?

29:01.865 --> 29:03.843
- Tickle-ickle-ickle... - Come on!
- Julian, fuck o...

29:03.867 --> 29:05.057
You're not tricking

29:05.058 --> 29:06.298
me with the fucking belly work!

29:06.329 --> 29:07.973
- I'll do some fucking - wiener work for.
- That kind of money.

29:07.997 --> 29:10.247
I don't want wiener work.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.668
This is a fucking bad idea!

29:11.669 --> 29:13.003
I'm just going to say that.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.205
(Sigh)

29:15.296 --> 29:17.376
But I'll do it.

29:17.465 --> 29:18.820
I'll fucking do it

29:18.821 --> 29:20.221
just to get the team back together.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.389
But on one condition:

29:22.470 --> 29:24.845
45 days, and we go

29:24.846 --> 29:27.220
back to making pizza sauce, all of us.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.138
- Deal.
- Deal.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.516
Oh, fuck...

29:30.517 --> 29:31.806
(Laughing) Right on, boys!

29:31.895 --> 29:33.000
(Whimpering)

29:33.001 --> 29:34.105
Cheers! Yeah!

29:34.190 --> 29:37.570
(Music)

30:17.525 --> 30:20.395
(Seabirds squawking)

30:32.582 --> 30:34.437
Fish:

30:34.438 --> 30:36.292
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!

30:36.377 --> 30:38.997
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

30:43.133 --> 30:44.473
- (Whisper)
- <i>Fuck.</i>

30:44.552 --> 30:45.552
(Light clicks off)

30:45.553 --> 30:46.553
<i>Fuck off.</i>
