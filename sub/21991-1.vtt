07:28.281 --> 07:30.523
It's no joke. I've been drafted.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.485
Oh my, drafted?

07:33.620 --> 07:36.863
Don't you intellectuals know that slogan?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.825
"The people have a duty to the nation."

07:39.918 --> 07:42.831
Then will you send your son to do his duty?

07:43.838 --> 07:45.875
My son has tuberculosis!

07:49.427 --> 07:53.171
If not for that, he could serve
in the rear like you, earn money,

07:53.264 --> 07:55.426
and support

07:55.517 --> 07:58.100

07:58.812 --> 07:59.643

Damn.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.642
Are you going to play this music all night?

08:05.777 --> 08:08.861
We're sending boys off
to war, it's too gloomy!

08:08.947 --> 08:10.859
Don't you have any nice jazz?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.190
Why?

08:12.283 --> 08:15.651
You know that jazz is banned.
You want me arrested?

08:15.745 --> 08:18.203
Who's going to arrest you?

08:18.289 --> 08:22.454
This room is filled with high-ranking,
well-connected people.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.795
We need some fun for once.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.955
You want some fun?

08:28.133 --> 08:30.921

09:27.150 --> 09:28.436
On the stage.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.314
If he wants to stay out of jail,
tell him to come down and find me.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.238
Huh, why? Did he make trouble again?

09:34.407 --> 09:39.027
Damned idiot fooled around
with a section chief's wife!

09:45.835 --> 09:48.168
Gang-ok!

09:48.463 --> 09:51.251

09:51.341 --> 09:54.209

Gang-ok!

09:56.387 --> 09:57.298
Okay!

09:57.388 --> 09:58.924
Give her a hand!

10:00.558 --> 10:02.140
No, come on!

Stand up!

10:22.914 --> 10:24.450
Spin! Spin, you brat.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.376
Wait, Daddy! Wait!

10:31.756 --> 10:34.749
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

10:34.884 --> 10:38.798
The section chief's wife likes my music.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.131
She kept offering to buy dinner,
how can I turn it down?

10:42.267 --> 10:45.476
And the theater owner
kept telling me to meet her.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.845
All we did was eat.

10:47.939 --> 10:51.808
If you get drafted for
this, what will she do?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.522
I'm not going to be drafted!

11:00.618 --> 11:05.238
You think you'll get away
with touching a section chief's wife?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.948
Then today you play jazz?

11:15.550 --> 11:18.418
Did you bring it?

11:26.728 --> 11:27.844
Here.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.059
It's nine musicians, including you.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.483
And your daughter makes ten.

11:37.572 --> 11:42.067
There'll be nothing left for me
and my police colleagues.

11:42.619 --> 11:47.205
I'm always in your debt, Mr. Sugiyama.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.077
Look.

11:50.919 --> 11:54.913
I'll arrange a bribe for you and your band.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.458
I'm asking around
the offices of Japanese factories.

11:58.676 --> 12:02.761
Explain the situation to your band well.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.214
And bring in some more cash.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.385
You always said you wanted to work in Japan.

12:09.479 --> 12:13.223
I heard the army was
driven out of the Philippines again?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.182
Is Japan going to lose?

12:16.069 --> 12:19.187
That's all just talk.
Don't you read the papers?

12:19.322 --> 12:22.360
There are thousands of U. S.
POWs in Japan now.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.285
It'll be over before
the cherry blossoms fall, trust me.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.908
We're going to see cherry blossoms?

12:29.332 --> 12:36.705
"12th Feb 1945 Ferry to Shimonoseki"

12:36.923 --> 12:38.710
Get off, then.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.133
Let's go.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.388
God, what a smell.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.058
You should be sucking on your mom's breasts!

12:57.151 --> 13:00.235
What's a kid like you doing on this boat?

13:00.321 --> 13:04.986
I was on my way home, and the town clerk

13:05.076 --> 13:08.069
puts me in a truck saying
I'm about to earn money.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.027
Okay, Okay.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.738
Couldn't even tell my parents before leaving.

13:10.832 --> 13:15.623
Tell me about it.
They dragged me off on my wedding night.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.452
As a newlywed?

13:16.546 --> 13:20.256
I am still hard down there
and already forgetting her face.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.670
You in the glasses, how'd you end up here?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.092
I go to Keijo University.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.044
Whoa!

13:26.139 --> 13:27.630
You an intellectual?

13:27.724 --> 13:32.014
Better than being drafted
as a student soldier.

13:33.563 --> 13:37.432
I heard if you work like crazy
for one year, you get a house?

13:37.525 --> 13:38.891
Even still,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.773
how could they drag off pre-pubescent boys?

13:41.863 --> 13:44.776
Snatching them from the fields,
or when they're out wrestling.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.528
Give me the case.

13:47.869 --> 13:51.658
When the boat lands, we'll ditch these guys.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.239
- So bear it until then.
- Okay.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.996
All of you brought cash?

13:56.169 --> 13:57.535
Take it out.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.467
This is our lifeline.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.503
Gimme that.

14:07.638 --> 14:12.804
- If we lose this we're dead, okay?
- Okay.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.649
Dad, where are we really going?

14:21.736 --> 14:24.069
You'll see later. Stop asking me!

14:26.491 --> 14:28.198
You asshole!

14:30.203 --> 14:31.319
There's a fight.

14:31.746 --> 14:32.782
Is that Choi Chil-sung?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.329
The famous gangster?

14:34.415 --> 14:39.285
Stupid Koreans...
can't help but fight each other.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.295
(Stop fighting! Calm down!)

14:50.932 --> 14:52.298
Sohee!

14:52.392 --> 14:54.224
Go away! Go!

15:03.778 --> 15:07.237
(Any more trouble,
we'll call it a riot and start shooting.)

15:07.323 --> 15:10.236
What the fuck is he saying?

15:10.326 --> 15:11.487
Hey!

15:12.495 --> 15:14.862
Can anyone here speak Jap?

15:15.123 --> 15:18.082
If you freak out again
they'll start shooting.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.576
So shut the fuck up and calm down.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.536
How'd your mouth get so filthy?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.747
Is it as filthy between your legs?

15:24.841 --> 15:27.925
Did you ever see between my legs?

15:28.136 --> 15:30.469
- Did you?
- Do you even know who you're talking to?

15:30.638 --> 15:31.970
(Sit down!)

15:32.181 --> 15:35.595
You look like gangsters from some Seoul slum.

15:35.685 --> 15:40.805
So if the Japs slap you around,
you take it out on Korean girls?

15:41.983 --> 15:44.896
(Quiet! Sit down!)

15:46.529 --> 15:48.987
All right, just let go.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.484
Sit down, guys.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.699
I said sit!

15:53.870 --> 15:56.738
Not much worth grabbing there anyway.

15:56.831 --> 16:00.996
Your poor mom probably felt happy
when you came out with balls.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.708
Wow, she made a fool of him.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.623
Stick out too much, and people hate you.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.084
Sometimes you gotta keep your head down.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.590
Some people bring on their fate.

If you lose my hand,
watch my back and follow me.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.499
- You guys, hold those cases tight.
- Okay!

16:42.585 --> 16:44.497
Stay focused.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.086
Hold this.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.537
(Please stop!)

19:51.107 --> 19:52.473
Next!

20:10.167 --> 20:12.250
Take your bag and go!

20:36.527 --> 20:38.644
It really is nothing, you see.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.691
I just have cigarettes.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.522
(What's this?)

20:43.576 --> 20:45.158
(Give it here!)

20:45.536 --> 20:46.902
Go, now!

20:48.414 --> 20:50.371
Don't stare. Eyes forward!

20:50.458 --> 20:53.201
Shut up and put your hands on your head!

20:53.419 --> 20:56.628
Hands on your head! On your head!

20:58.340 --> 20:59.547
(Nothing.)

20:59.675 --> 21:01.462
(I have nothing.)

21:01.552 --> 21:02.963
Foreheads on the ground!

21:03.137 --> 21:04.469
(What do we do with these?)

21:04.555 --> 21:06.012
It's war here, too.

21:10.186 --> 21:15.898
Get rid of that
Korean habit of depending on everyone!

21:15.983 --> 21:18.191
Sir! Sir! You're Korean?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.394
Just a moment, please!

21:20.488 --> 21:22.445
There's been some kind of mistake.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.402
I was supposed to meet someone here.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.700
We haven't been drafted like the others.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.621
This is from Detective Sugiyama
at Seoul Central Police Station!

21:30.831 --> 21:33.619
And this is our performing license.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.043
I'm Lee Gang-ok of the Lee Gang-ok Band.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.379
We released a record at Okay Record Company.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.082
We performed at Government Hall,
Myungdong Theater,

21:42.176 --> 21:44.759
- Peninsula Hotel, everywhere!
- Musicians?

21:44.845 --> 21:46.837
1, 2, 3, 4!

21:56.232 --> 22:00.522
(What the hell is that?)

22:01.487 --> 22:05.106
They said it's a factory.
Why take off our clothes?

22:05.199 --> 22:06.781
(Follow me!)

22:13.666 --> 22:15.328
(Are those tattoos?)

22:20.005 --> 22:22.088
(Here at Hashima Comfort Station, )

22:22.174 --> 22:23.881
(we've received a special medal for)

22:23.968 --> 22:25.925
(being free of venereal disease.)

22:26.345 --> 22:28.883
(Please keep yourselves clean)

22:28.973 --> 22:31.716
(and protect our perfect record.)

22:34.854 --> 22:36.220
(Next.)

22:39.525 --> 22:41.437
Sir, just a minute.

22:42.653 --> 22:46.397
This is a luxury Western watch called Rolex.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.775
It was a gift from someone
at the Governor-General's office.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.532
I'm sure you'll take care of things,

22:52.621 --> 22:54.453
but I came here with my daughter.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.658
Lee Sohee. We came off the boat separately.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.413
She's just a little girl.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.210
If you could even tell me where she is...

23:01.297 --> 23:03.880
(Can you play
'Cherry Blossoms of the Same Class'?)

23:04.049 --> 23:05.256
(Yes!)

23:12.141 --> 23:16.431
Damned music men are settling in comfortably.

23:26.780 --> 23:31.400
<i>(You and I are)</i>

23:31.535 --> 23:36.371
<i>(cherry blossoms of the same class, )</i>

23:36.498 --> 23:41.334
<i>(blooming in the same)</i>

23:41.462 --> 23:45.877

23:46.008 --> 23:50.378

23:59.980 --> 24:05.192
<i>(for the sake of our nation.)</i>

24:15.579 --> 24:18.538
(I see some talented men
from Korea have arrived.)

24:18.624 --> 24:19.455
(Welcome.)

24:19.541 --> 24:20.372
(Yes!)

24:20.459 --> 24:21.620
(Thank you.)

24:21.710 --> 24:23.542
(My name is Lee...)

24:24.421 --> 24:26.504
(Sorry... sorry.)

24:28.258 --> 24:31.422
(I am the manager of Hashima Mine, )

24:31.512 --> 24:33.720
(Shimazaki Daisuke.)

24:33.973 --> 24:36.056
(We welcome you from distant Korea)

24:39.061 --> 24:43.226

Majesty the Emperor.)

24:43.315 --> 24:48.652

in the Imperial Army's war.)

24:59.248 --> 25:03.117
<i>(to the industry of the
Great Japanese Empire.)</i>

25:03.627 --> 25:07.246
<i>(The coal we produce here
is not merely coal.)</i>

25:07.339 --> 25:08.921
<i>(A single lump of coal)</i>

25:09.049 --> 25:10.881
<i>(is a drop of blood, )</i>

25:10.968 --> 25:11.924
<i>(a weapon, )</i>

25:12.094 --> 25:13.551
<i>(and a piece of history!)</i>

25:13.721 --> 25:16.054

"Japanese Residential Area Comfort Station"

25:36.285 --> 25:38.527
(Filthy whore!)

25:40.122 --> 25:41.488
(Dirty!)

25:42.499 --> 25:44.866
Don't get pregnant at the comfort station...

25:44.960 --> 25:48.920
One woman got pregnant at the Chinese station

25:49.006 --> 25:51.248
they cut her stomach and took the baby out.

25:51.341 --> 25:54.925
And a few days later
she was receiving soldiers again.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.517

28:12.524 --> 28:14.516
Hey, get moving!

28:15.527 --> 28:17.268
(Consider today a workplace tour)

28:17.362 --> 28:19.319
(to learn your duties.)

28:19.573 --> 28:21.565
(We at Hashima Mine)

Get up now!

28:58.362 --> 29:00.354

Your glasses broke, so you're talking back?

Are you? Are you?

29:06.453 --> 29:08.319
Stop it, you asshole!

29:10.040 --> 29:12.032
Even dogs deserve to eat and wash in peace!

Korean boss of yours.)

29:49.288 --> 29:52.622
I'm that famous Seoul
gangster Choi Chil-sung.

I came here to beat your Korean yakuza boss.

We fight samurai style, and if I win,

me and my boys will watch over the Koreans.

(We fight samurai style, and if I win, )

30:16.106 --> 30:20.567

30:20.861 --> 30:24.946
If I lose, I'll treat him as my boss.

30:25.073 --> 30:29.864
(If I lose, that Korean
boss will be my boss.)

30:30.203 --> 30:31.865
You assholes.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.160

Drag him off!

30:53.769 --> 30:54.850
(Comfort station?)

32:17.561 --> 32:19.223
Everyone stop!

32:22.566 --> 32:26.526
Koreans fighting each other
is just what they want!

32:27.446 --> 32:29.358
The more we fight,

32:29.739 --> 32:31.856
the more we play into their hands!

32:32.033 --> 32:35.993
This bastard isn't Korean
like the rest of us.

32:38.248 --> 32:41.616
What are you looking at, you stupid Koreans?

32:42.210 --> 32:45.248
From now on, I'll be leading the Koreans!

32:45.464 --> 32:49.674
If you back me, I'll keep
the Koreans in line.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.763
(Go talk to the labor office.)

32:58.852 --> 33:00.684
Hurrah for Choi Chil-sung!

33:07.027 --> 33:09.610
And where did this freak come from?

33:09.696 --> 33:16.239
<i>Let's whistle for him,
new boss Choi Chil-sung!</i>

33:24.127 --> 33:26.494

33:42.312 --> 33:43.974
(why so melancholy?)

33:44.064 --> 33:47.432
(You, who will give up your bodies)

33:47.526 --> 33:49.483
(to our soldiers fighting
in the Great East Asian War)

33:49.569 --> 33:51.777
(and to our soldiers of industry, )

33:51.863 --> 33:54.446
(are indeed invaluable assets.)

33:54.908 --> 33:56.865
(Take pride in yourselves.)

33:57.160 --> 34:00.198
(We used to employ first-class geisha)

34:00.288 --> 34:01.950
(or former actresses from film studios.)

34:02.040 --> 34:04.282
(Now mostly Korean women work here.)

34:04.417 --> 34:09.663
(But this innocence is part of their charm!)

34:10.215 --> 34:14.801
(This mood is too heavy
for a feast of welcome.)

34:14.928 --> 34:17.045
(Play that record I brought.)

34:17.138 --> 34:18.094
(Yes sir!)

34:18.181 --> 34:21.299
(To help you feel comfortable, )

34:21.518 --> 34:24.181
(I brought a Korean record which I enjoy.)

34:24.271 --> 34:25.887
(It's quite lively.)

34:26.106 --> 34:27.972
(We prepared beds for you here, )

34:28.065 --> 34:30.353
(so relax, listen to some music)

34:30.485 --> 34:33.273
(and get to bed early tonight.)

34:43.665 --> 34:45.327
This is me singing!

34:57.094 --> 34:59.132
I sang this song!

34:59.931 --> 35:01.263
(Hey! What are you doing?)

35:01.349 --> 35:02.806
(Give it back!)

35:03.184 --> 35:05.892
Tell them I used to sing this song!

35:05.979 --> 35:09.017
Tell them I sang it, please!

35:09.107 --> 35:10.439
Tell them!

35:10.525 --> 35:14.485
(She sang what's playing right now.)

35:16.865 --> 35:20.654
I can sing and dance,
play instruments, whatever!

35:20.744 --> 35:24.363
I can clean and do laundry!

35:24.497 --> 35:29.083
(She can perform, play instruments
and is also good at housework.)

35:30.337 --> 35:32.294
He asked what you did in Korea.

35:32.714 --> 35:36.298
I played music in Seoul. The Yamamura Band.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.302
(She performed at the Yamamura Band.)

35:40.388 --> 35:43.802
My father and the rest of the band
are all here!

35:47.437 --> 35:49.053
(Long live the Emperor!)

35:49.272 --> 35:51.889
(Hurrah!)

35:56.279 --> 35:59.192
(Long live the Emperor!)

35:59.366 --> 36:02.575
(Hurrah!)

36:45.412 --> 36:52.376
"July 1945, OSS training camp,
Korean Liberation Army in China"

36:54.170 --> 36:57.083
<i>How is your training with the OSS soldiers?</i>

36:57.215 --> 36:58.922
I'm trying my best.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.676
You've got higher marks than the Americans.

37:02.762 --> 37:06.255
The Seoul infiltration operation
you've been planning...

37:06.349 --> 37:10.013
I'm sorry, but we need
you for something else.

37:10.228 --> 37:14.313
Some OSS intelligence was leaked to our side.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.891
<i>The U. S. has developed a new bomb.</i>

37:16.985 --> 37:18.817
<i>They say its power is beyond imagination.</i>

37:18.903 --> 37:21.816
The blast radius is up to 200km.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.819
If they drop that from a B-29
onto the Japanese mainland...

37:24.909 --> 37:27.026
That's all unconfirmed talk for now.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.783
The point is, the Soviets
are about to invade.

37:29.873 --> 37:32.911
The U. S. has already taken Okinawa.

37:33.042 --> 37:36.956
If the Soviets join in,
Japan won't last long.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.957
It's time to focus on winning the war,
not the battle.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.464
For a speedy liberation,
we must join together.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.179
Yoon Hak-chul.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.384
Only he can resolve the conflicts

37:51.478 --> 37:54.971
between all the factions fighting
for Korean independence.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.227
He handled fundraising at the KPG,

37:57.317 --> 37:59.479
but two years ago he was
caught by the Japanese

37:59.569 --> 38:01.356
and disappeared without a trace.

38:01.571 --> 38:04.609
We assumed he was executed without trial,

38:04.783 --> 38:08.242
<i>but according to U. S. intel
he was detained near Nagasaki</i>

38:08.369 --> 38:10.201
<i>at Hashima Coal Mine.</i>

38:11.206 --> 38:13.323
Go bring back Mr. Yoon.

38:14.459 --> 38:18.169
"We will always be together. Our Hashima."

38:22.467 --> 38:24.584
Gather around, everyone.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.760
If we screw up again,
we'll be back in the mines.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.886
Do your best! And smile!

38:32.727 --> 38:36.516
If you don't smile I'll have Chil-sung
take you back to the mine.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.313
Get ready, quick!

38:42.904 --> 38:44.270
Hey, why don't you eat that?

38:44.364 --> 38:46.230
Raw eggs are gross.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.237
Eat when I tell you, kid!
It's great for your throat.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.660
Some people can't eat at all! Hurry up!

38:55.625 --> 38:56.661
Hey!

38:56.918 --> 38:59.752
Abracadabra... ta-dah!

39:00.964 --> 39:02.751
Look at that grin.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.549
If you're gonna eat, then pay for it!

39:05.635 --> 39:08.878
Newbies who arrived today,
just follow the man in front!

39:08.972 --> 39:12.966
Fuckers don't feed us crap.
The fuck is he blabbering about?

39:13.059 --> 39:14.925
Isn't that dynamite? What'll you do with it?

39:15.019 --> 39:17.011
Stop sputtering and be quiet!

39:17.564 --> 39:20.978
The liquid that seeps out is sweet.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.476
Need to eat at least that to survive.

39:23.570 --> 39:26.062
What if your stomach explodes?

39:26.948 --> 39:28.405
Give me a taste!

39:33.663 --> 39:35.199
Help me here!

39:46.926 --> 39:48.292
It's okay.

39:48.845 --> 39:52.805
It's just the coal dust in my lungs.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.008
Sir, are you okay?

39:55.101 --> 39:56.387
I'm fine!

39:58.771 --> 40:01.354
Hey, there's gas coming out!

40:02.150 --> 40:03.641
So what?

40:03.735 --> 40:06.694
Block off the gas! And pump out sea water!

40:06.779 --> 40:10.068
(At the center of Japan's leadership)

40:10.199 --> 40:12.942
(in the Great East Asian War
is Hashima Coal Mine!)

40:13.077 --> 40:13.942
<i>(Long live the Emperor!)</i>

40:14.037 --> 40:15.573
<i>(Long live the Japanese Empire!)</i>

40:15.663 --> 40:17.529
<i>(For Hashima Mine and)</i>

40:17.624 --> 40:19.616
<i>(its executives returning
to the head office!)</i>

40:19.709 --> 40:22.076
(Cheers!)

40:28.968 --> 40:35.386
Rock, scissors, paper! Rock! Rock!

40:35.475 --> 40:37.808
Okay, your turn.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.028
You okay?

40:55.036 --> 40:56.698
Support his back.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.951
Are you hurt?

41:11.970 --> 41:13.381
Hey kid, out of the way!

41:13.471 --> 41:14.257
Kid!

41:14.347 --> 41:16.009
Look out!

41:25.400 --> 41:28.143
Huh? What's that noise?

41:47.422 --> 41:48.879
Explosion!

41:49.090 --> 41:52.083
Run out quick! Bring your tools!

41:52.385 --> 41:54.422
Don't drop your tools, bring them!

41:54.512 --> 41:55.969
(Thank you.)

41:56.556 --> 41:58.092
(Thank you very much.)

42:00.393 --> 42:01.884
(Thank you very much.)

42:07.650 --> 42:09.482
(Thank you very much.)

42:15.825 --> 42:18.989
(How many times has Mine No. 2 caught fire?)

42:19.078 --> 42:22.116
(Do I need to step in
every time this happens?)

42:25.376 --> 42:27.413
(What about the passage to Mine No.3?)

42:27.503 --> 42:29.540
(It hasn't spread there yet.)

42:33.885 --> 42:37.094
(How much is Mine 2 producing?)

42:37.221 --> 42:38.837
(It has the lowest production.)

42:38.931 --> 42:41.969
(We're already 1100 meters
below the seafloor, )

42:42.060 --> 42:44.302
(so it'll be hard to mine deeper.)

42:44.437 --> 42:45.348
Save me.

42:45.438 --> 42:46.895
Save the young ones first!

42:46.981 --> 42:50.941
Mr. Yoon! You must go up!

42:51.277 --> 42:54.645
Don't let anyone die! Not one!

42:59.452 --> 43:01.990
(That's the Korean section, right?)

43:02.163 --> 43:06.407
(Seal them off.
Prevent damage spreading to other mines.)

43:11.589 --> 43:14.627
There are people here! You bastards!

43:15.009 --> 43:16.750
There are people here!

43:20.932 --> 43:23.470
(Sir, Yoon Hak-chul is in the mine!)

43:25.686 --> 43:26.893
(Out of the way!)

43:26.979 --> 43:28.595
(I told you not to put him in the mine!)

43:28.689 --> 43:32.808
(What if he dies and the Koreans riot?)

43:33.277 --> 43:36.270
(By whatever means necessary, get him out!)

43:40.034 --> 43:42.492
Hold on just a bit!

43:50.711 --> 43:53.749
You gonna work all day? Huh?

43:53.881 --> 43:56.123
They're waiting for you!

43:56.425 --> 43:59.463
(Jong-gu! There's a problem in Mine 2!)

44:00.179 --> 44:05.015
Damn, I worked all night!
Why'd they have to wake me up?

44:05.101 --> 44:08.139
Isn't that where we plugged
the gas leak before?

44:09.021 --> 44:12.981
Hey, just shut your mouth and follow orders!

44:13.943 --> 44:16.902
Ah, are you back on duty?

44:20.616 --> 44:21.948
Fuck!

44:22.618 --> 44:24.484
You sure this connects to Mine 3?

44:24.579 --> 44:26.195
Shouldn't you know that?

44:26.289 --> 44:27.245
What? You prick!

44:27.331 --> 44:28.162
Blast through it.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.243
What?

44:29.417 --> 44:30.624
There's no other way.

44:30.710 --> 44:33.828
We point the gas
at these supports, and light it.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.958
Newbie! Shut the fuck up!

44:36.257 --> 44:39.091
There's no guarantee
we can get enough gas here.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.293
You know...

44:41.512 --> 44:45.381
I hid this thing here.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.521
- We can't drill any deeper.
- We can't!

44:52.607 --> 44:55.645
Gas keeps leaking, what if there's a fire?

44:55.735 --> 44:59.854
That's why we called you technicians!

45:00.323 --> 45:01.689
Okay, okay...

45:32.980 --> 45:33.936
It's going in!

45:34.023 --> 45:34.934
Keep drilling!

45:35.024 --> 45:36.390
Drill! Drill!

45:42.365 --> 45:43.572
Pull!

45:43.741 --> 45:44.948
Pull it!

45:55.044 --> 45:57.411
<i>(The Koreans heard there was an accident, )</i>

45:57.505 --> 46:01.340
<i>(but they don't know yet who lived or died.)</i>

46:01.550 --> 46:05.385
(Announce we'll move wounded Koreans
to a main hospital in Nagasaki, )

46:05.513 --> 46:08.756
(then send them to the crematorium
and burn them with the corpses.)

46:08.849 --> 46:11.432
(There are limits
to how many Koreans we can bring.)

46:11.519 --> 46:13.385
<i>(Given the war struggles, )</i>

46:13.521 --> 46:17.435
<i>(will we allow the company
to keep losing money?)</i>

46:18.651 --> 46:22.816
(I'll be sure to contain the problem.)

46:23.406 --> 46:25.113
<i>(Chiba-san.)</i>

46:25.324 --> 46:28.613
<i>(When do you plan to inspect our mine?)</i>

46:29.036 --> 46:30.652
<i>- (The thing is...)
- I'm sorry!</i>

46:30.746 --> 46:35.866
<i>(As I'm grateful for
your recommendation of our facility)</i>

46:36.043 --> 46:39.207
(I mean to send someone
to express my deepest gratitude.)

46:39.588 --> 46:40.578
(I see.)

46:40.673 --> 46:42.756
(You won't be disappointed.)

46:44.969 --> 46:46.335
(Where is Yoon Hak-chul now?)

46:48.764 --> 46:51.302
He's coming! He's coming!

46:51.392 --> 46:52.553
Here he comes!

46:56.814 --> 47:01.650
(If the company
doesn't release a list of casualties, )

47:01.861 --> 47:06.401
(and draw up compensation and safety plans, )

47:06.532 --> 47:09.946
(I will refuse all talks
with Manager Shimazaki!)

47:10.036 --> 47:11.527
We support you!

47:19.545 --> 47:21.036
That's enough!

47:23.758 --> 47:27.092
Wait a minute! You give me this.

47:27.178 --> 47:28.589
You're in charge of toilets now.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.545
You'll scoop piss and shit!

47:33.225 --> 47:34.386
Hey!

47:50.868 --> 47:52.075
Fuck...

47:59.835 --> 48:03.454
(Someone tell this madman not to hit me!)

48:03.547 --> 48:06.290
(Then give me my money's worth!)

48:06.717 --> 48:10.131
(I don't need
any Korean bitches glaring at me.)

48:10.221 --> 48:12.338
(I'll drink when I want!)

48:13.516 --> 48:15.599
(Hey, calm down!)

48:31.534 --> 48:35.448
You got trained by the Americans,
but without their help

48:35.538 --> 48:38.497
you think you can escort Mr.
Yoon out of here?

48:38.791 --> 48:41.283
The plan was to use the network here

48:41.419 --> 48:44.503
and contact Korean agents
at OSS headquarters.

48:44.713 --> 48:48.002
Through an agent
planted on the food ship that stops here

48:48.843 --> 48:52.052
we'll go by ship to the U. S. base in Okinawa.

48:52.304 --> 48:55.138
How do we know you're not on their side?

48:55.766 --> 48:58.600
You say you're OSS-trained resistance?

48:58.978 --> 49:03.723
I was a student soldier
sent to Japanese unit 7991 in China,

49:03.816 --> 49:06.399
then I escaped last July in Xuzhou,

49:06.485 --> 49:10.069
and met KLA General Lee
Beom-seok in Chongqing.

49:11.407 --> 49:13.899
Did he send any personal message to me?

49:13.993 --> 49:18.704
He says he'll treat you
to your favorite trotter stew

49:18.998 --> 49:20.739
at Hwapyung Restaurant.

49:23.169 --> 49:25.035
When do you plan to move?

49:36.557 --> 49:38.469
I'll send in another girl.

49:38.767 --> 49:40.099
Just sit.

49:43.898 --> 49:47.062
I said sit! I'm not here for romance.

49:47.693 --> 49:48.934
Why not?

49:49.069 --> 49:52.608
Do the marks on my chest make you go limp?

49:52.781 --> 49:54.067
Hell...

49:55.159 --> 50:00.325
Don't you need a Korean to complain to,
to breathe easier?

50:04.210 --> 50:07.169
Fuck... even worse than the Japs

50:07.254 --> 50:09.871
are these damned mosquitos.

50:31.445 --> 50:33.812
At first I was dragged to China.

50:35.074 --> 50:39.239
I had no idea. They said I was going to work.

50:39.328 --> 50:43.117
They drove me to a Japanese army base.

50:43.332 --> 50:49.704
Hell, the mosquitos bit me like crazy.

50:50.214 --> 50:53.423
Some mosquito bites can kill a person.

50:53.968 --> 50:58.212
One bite, and your whole
body swells with fever.

50:58.347 --> 51:01.715
However much you drink, your insides burn.

51:02.851 --> 51:05.468
There was a girl from Heungyang.

51:05.646 --> 51:07.808
<i>The Japanese said
she was pretending to be sick,</i>

51:07.898 --> 51:11.812
<i>put her on nails and
rolled her back and forth.</i>

51:12.319 --> 51:16.029
<i>She died in front of everyone.</i>

51:16.699 --> 51:20.568
I was too scared to tell them I was sick.

51:20.786 --> 51:24.746
Figured I'd rather die fast, so I drank lye.

51:24.873 --> 51:29.493
It was a Japanese doctor
who stopped me from dying.

51:29.837 --> 51:34.423
But then a Korean pimp washed me

51:34.508 --> 51:37.171
and threw me right back
at those Japanese guys.

51:37.928 --> 51:46.143
It was a fucking Korean town clerk
who sent me to that comfort station!

51:46.353 --> 51:49.517
When the unit retreated, I barely escaped,

51:49.607 --> 51:52.941
but that Korean pimp caught and sent me here!

51:53.360 --> 51:55.773
So I need a Korean to complain to?

51:56.905 --> 51:58.942
To breathe easier?

52:01.827 --> 52:03.784
Biting the hand that feeds you.

52:05.247 --> 52:07.455
You need to control your temper.

52:11.295 --> 52:15.790
Sooner or later, things will get better.

52:47.373 --> 52:48.739
Fuck!

52:51.085 --> 52:53.042
Are you doing a lousy job on purpose?

52:53.128 --> 52:55.461
Try finding any guy who
won't get off on this!

52:55.547 --> 52:57.709
Dragging me out of the hospital to do this...

52:57.800 --> 52:58.756
Okay, here.

52:58.842 --> 53:02.961
I send out so many of these,
why does so little come back?

53:03.055 --> 53:05.012
Damned guards cut the rations.

53:05.099 --> 53:07.432
You're not hoarding it yourself?

53:07.518 --> 53:08.599
Shit...

53:10.646 --> 53:12.603
Bro, just one cigarette.

53:13.273 --> 53:14.730
You still didn't pay for last month's.

53:14.817 --> 53:20.108
The damned Japanese raised
their pension funds or whatever!

53:20.197 --> 53:21.779
We all had them raised!

53:21.865 --> 53:24.949
So control your gambling!
If you're broke, just sleep.

53:25.327 --> 53:28.286
Wait, pay me more!

53:34.253 --> 53:35.460
Dammit.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.333
Give this to the attendant for 10 cigarettes.

53:38.424 --> 53:39.881
Yes, sir.

53:46.014 --> 53:47.880
Manager Shimazaki is calling you.

54:00.195 --> 54:01.481
Sohee!

54:04.908 --> 54:06.274
What is it? Oh no...

54:06.368 --> 54:09.907
- A splinter.
- Be more careful, kid!

54:16.086 --> 54:17.543
What's that smell?

54:36.940 --> 54:40.524
(I've been thinking of this for a while.)

54:41.028 --> 54:43.611
(After today's accident, )

54:43.822 --> 54:46.405
(I thought I should meet you)

54:46.492 --> 54:48.074
(and propose something, )

54:48.243 --> 54:50.155
(before it's too late.)

54:50.579 --> 54:51.615
(I see.)

54:51.914 --> 54:54.782
(About your daughter...)

54:55.125 --> 54:57.287
<i>(In the recent U. S. bombing
of our head office, )</i>

54:57.377 --> 55:01.542
<i>(Chiba-san lost his daughter.)</i>

55:01.673 --> 55:04.916
(Rather than having her stay here,
where it's so dangerous, )

55:05.052 --> 55:06.338
<i>(I was thinking)</i>

55:06.428 --> 55:09.796
<i>(to send her to Chiba-san
as an adopted daughter.)</i>

55:10.724 --> 55:12.260
(Mr. Lee.)

55:12.643 --> 55:14.600
(We're in a war.)

55:15.020 --> 55:17.933
(In wartime, winners don't always survive.)

55:18.232 --> 55:21.441
(Survivors are true winners.)

55:23.111 --> 55:26.024
<i>(On the next freight ship out, )</i>

55:26.240 --> 55:30.200
<i>(let's send Sohee.)</i>

55:30.953 --> 55:32.069
Huh?

55:42.673 --> 55:44.539
Wow!

55:46.426 --> 55:51.512
<i>Meeting in this world of woe,</i>

55:51.598 --> 55:56.844
<i>what is your wish?</i>

55:56.937 --> 56:05.107
<i>Will being rich make you happy?</i>

56:05.195 --> 56:06.527
Airplane!

56:12.286 --> 56:13.948
The post office key?

56:15.873 --> 56:17.830
We'll pay whatever you want.

56:17.916 --> 56:20.829
Hell, how would you know what I want?

56:23.839 --> 56:25.455
We'll give you this in advance.

56:25.549 --> 56:27.916
Wow, advance pay?

56:28.677 --> 56:31.340
I need to know what this is about.

56:32.014 --> 56:34.176
We need to check a package.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.979
I don't team up with people who keep secrets.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.231
If you need to check a package,

56:47.321 --> 56:50.189
isn't it easier to just bribe
one of the labor officers?

56:50.282 --> 56:53.070
- The thing is...
- We need the telegraph.

56:54.661 --> 56:56.072
The telegraph?

56:59.750 --> 57:00.957
Know how to use it?

57:03.295 --> 57:05.002
Just get us the key.

57:07.466 --> 57:10.209
A newbie wants to use the telegraph.

57:10.761 --> 57:14.971
A Korean who looks like
an independence leader bribes me...

57:16.975 --> 57:19.308
What's going on here?

57:22.814 --> 57:24.680
Forget it, then.

57:25.651 --> 57:26.892
I already know,

57:26.902 --> 57:29.110
- how can I forget?
- Quiet!

57:31.406 --> 57:35.776
Should I go ask the boss to look into this?

57:39.247 --> 57:40.613
Park Mu-young!

57:41.166 --> 57:44.125
Mr. Yoon will escape from here.

57:46.713 --> 57:50.548
Hey Gang-ok,
all we need is the key, no trouble.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.466
You decide.

57:52.928 --> 57:55.011
If you don't cooperate,

57:56.139 --> 57:57.926
then we'll kill you.

57:58.266 --> 57:59.598
(Hey, Yamamura!)

57:59.893 --> 58:03.557
(What are you doing out past curfew?)

58:11.196 --> 58:13.062
(Where have you been?)

58:13.824 --> 58:15.656
(I've been looking for you.)

58:16.076 --> 58:17.942
(The drawings are done, )

58:18.036 --> 58:19.618
(tell Maeda to see me tomorrow.)

58:19.705 --> 58:21.321
(What, already?)

58:21.540 --> 58:23.452
(I want one, too!)

58:23.792 --> 58:26.250
(But what are you doing here?)

58:28.797 --> 58:31.505
(They're fighting over gambling debts.)

58:31.591 --> 58:34.550
(I'm trying to mediate.)

58:34.678 --> 58:36.260
(Damn idiots!)

58:36.513 --> 58:37.503
Shake hands!

58:39.391 --> 58:43.226
(I'll take care of this, you go on.)

58:43.520 --> 58:45.386
(All right, then.)

58:46.273 --> 58:47.980
(Have a good night!)

58:59.161 --> 59:03.155
You don't need to pay,
but I have one condition.

59:03.874 --> 59:07.618
When he escapes, take me and my daughter.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.327
Gang-ok!

59:09.421 --> 59:12.289
I take it that old man won't be swimming?

59:12.382 --> 59:16.877
Since you want the telegraph,
you must have something lined up.

59:17.471 --> 59:19.053
Just kill me,

59:19.139 --> 59:22.098
or have the Japanese kill you,

59:22.184 --> 59:25.052
or take my daughter and me.

59:25.395 --> 59:28.058
This time, you decide.

59:31.026 --> 59:35.487
If our plan is leaked, I'll kill you myself.

59:40.035 --> 59:42.322
One, two, three!

59:44.289 --> 59:46.622
One, two, three!

59:55.759 --> 59:58.092
Where the hell did he go?

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:03.594
Can't he leave me alone?

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.426
Hey, go to my spot!

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.102
Hey painter!

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.811
Where's the guy who made me a lock that time?

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:14.392
Is he on the night shift?
Why don't I see him?

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:15.476
Bang!

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:17.983
They sent him to the tool repair factory...

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:18.904
Bang!

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:22.279
to work as a technician,
since he's good with tools.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.284
- Bang!
- Tool repair factory? Shit.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:29.323
(Good afternoon!)

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:35.330
(I need a favor from the locksmith.)

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:42.883
What brings you out here?
You want another lock?

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:46.341
No, I've got a really important key.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.892
I'm scared of losing it, so I'd like a copy.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:49.639
Hand it over.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:52.142
Yes but... I need to bring it back.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.393
Something smells fishy.

01:00:58.113 --> 01:01:00.275
How come you get all the luck?

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.988
Which woman's home?

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:08.704
You're quick.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:13.831
Her husband carries the key around.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:15.749
You know how it is.

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:21.675
(Here you go. See you later!)

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.500
Hello!

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:02.876
We'd still be nice to Sohee
without these gifts.

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:06.804
I know, but treat her well!

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:20.644
What are you sighing about?

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:28.409
I talked to your supervisor lady,

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.532
so move to her room.

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:33.490
If I call you at night, then run right out.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:37.577
Can't you ask the manager
to let us stay together?

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:40.084
Why? Did he do something?

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:43.007
It's just that I'm lonely here...

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.676
The other women tell me I'm annoying

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.755
even when the manager takes care of me.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:50.214
Damned bitches!

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:54.097
That's why I told you
to behave well with other people,

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:56.600
and be careful what impression you give!

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.641
What are you crying about?

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.274
Don't you know all that I'm doing for you?

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:07.732
Think you're the only one who's got it hard?

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:11.702
Why do you always say everything's my fault?

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:19.327
Never mind. What do I say to you?

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:20.748
Anyway...

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.504
Always be ready

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.299
so you can run right out if I call you.

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:30.005
Then we can be together, all right?

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:32.924
(Got a good movie for us?)

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:35.176
(Yes, a love story!)

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:51.112
(Good evening.)

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.789
(Want to see a dirty picture?)

01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:06.169
(Oh good!)

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:07.709
(Come this way.)

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:47.422
The outside door, the office
and the director's room.

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:49.296
You remember my terms?

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.553
I have eyes everywhere, you know.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:58.842
Hey, boss!

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:02.062
What is it now?

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.891
Nothing, I want to show you something.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.647
What the hell? It won't open?

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:49.310
Gang-ok, that rat!

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.328
Hey, assholes!

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:05.709
"Hashima..."

01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:06.288
"Hashima Eagle..."

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:09.250
"Hashima Eagle contacted"

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:10.418
"Preparations to..."

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:11.332
"Preparations to transport..."

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:12.500
"Preparations to transport Eagle..."

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:15.340
"Preparations to transport Eagle complete"

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.546
"Number..."

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:17.884
"Number of..."

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:20.850
"Number of passengers?"

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:26.479
"Yoon and Park"

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.897
"Two"

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:39.943
"Sending food..."

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:41.286
"Sending food transport ship..."

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:42.996
"Sending food transport ship in 48 hrs, 5AM"

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.748
"Find Takagura..."

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.083
"Find Takagura on transport..."

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.166
"Find Takagura on transport ship"

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:48.494
"Wishing safe..."

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:49.416
"Wishing safe return"

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:51.129
"End"

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:59.046
"Korean Account Records"

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:02.675
(Seems the war is going badly.)

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:08.681
(When was the last time Japan
used good paper like this?)

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:11.901
(What do propaganda pamphlets
have to do with the war?)

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:15.650
(The U. S. still has enough money)

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:18.820
(to make pamphlets with good paper.)

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:23.868
(Aren't wars ultimately won by
those with the most money?)

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:28.289
(Give me the relevant documents
for me and the other Koreans.)

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:31.419
(Ah...)

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:34.711
(More leaflets littering our island.)

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:37.008
(Those are bombers.)

01:08:00.285 --> 01:08:03.494
<i>(Citizens and employees, )</i>

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:08.040
<i>(because of U. S. bombardment,
turn off lights and stay indoors.)</i>

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.700
<i>(I repeat.)</i>

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:13.545
<i>(Citizens and employees, )</i>

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:18.251
<i>(because of U. S. bombardment,
turn off lights and stay indoors.)</i>

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.006
It's time.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.013
(Why so cheap this time?)

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:35.359
(Too many people involved now,
I want to wrap it up.)

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.314
(Where's the attendant?)

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:00.917
Let's go.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:16.600
Damn those bastards!

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:23.149
Sir, it's time for your medicine.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:26.948
Sir?

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.747
(Quiet around here.)

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:38.497
Sohee!

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.466
Sohee...

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.462
(What is it?)

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:49.091
(Gang-ok? Come on in.)

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:52.515
(All right. Where's Sohee?)

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:53.890
(Quick, Sohee...)

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.140
(I'll meet Sohee...)

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:57.857
(then go to your room.)

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:05.449
Shit.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.869
When did you last see Park?

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.197
What?

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.458
Mr. Yoon is missing.

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:20.464
I couldn't say goodbye to anyone.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:24.214
What kind of operation is this?

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.094
I had to keep everything completely secret.

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:33.935
And I have something to ask you first.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:39.226
I found Koreans' pay records
in the post office safe.

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.944
The pensions and bond payments

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:45.317
taken from their paychecks

01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:48.909
don't go to their accounts,
but to someone else's.

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:52.363
<i>Your name is entered on their contracts,</i>

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.991
<i>and half the money flowing into your account</i>

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.869
<i>is forwarded into Manager
Shimazaki's account.</i>

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.121
Are you aware of this?

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.502
Since coming here,

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:08.133
<i>I heard that pay is embezzled by
the manager and several others...</i>

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.465
but an account in my name?

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:15.227
<i>Even dead workers' compensation
is going in there,</i>

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:19.727
without their families being
told of their deaths.

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:24.187
Shimazaki... I never
thought he'd go this far.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.775
Looking through the documents,
I kept seeing your signature.

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.907
Who could have made those files?

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:37.241
Didn't it occur to you that
Shimazaki could've made it?

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:45.966
No labor strike or escape plan
has ever succeeded here.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.759
I wonder why.

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:51.804
If you set up a leader of the Koreans,

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.136
<i>and then use him,</i>

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:56.677
<i>then this kind of control is possible.</i>

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:02.475
Can you explain how a man
caught delivering huge sums for the KLA

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.982
could have received no
trial from the Japanese,

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:08.898
and ended up here?

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:13.743
This is just what Shimazaki wanted.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.780
Should I answer for you?

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.114
You fool!

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.874
Shimazaki knew someone like you was coming.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.034
You converted.

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:24.121
If you weren't on their
side, you'd be in jail.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:25.088
Park Mu-young!

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.416
No one will follow you once they find out.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.172
Why do you think

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.048
Shimazaki agreed to negotiate
over their protection?

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.807
Why?

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.343
Negotiate?

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:42.681
So dragging little boys off to mines
and stealing their money

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:44.771
was a negotiation?

01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:51.653
If you're so convinced of my guilt

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.776
then right here,

01:12:57.665 --> 01:12:59.327
shoot me.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:04.621
You scoundrel! Trying to run off without us?

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.004
I warned you!

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:07.376
That if you betray me, I'll report you!

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:08.043
You stay there!

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:09.045
Gang-ok!

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:11.130
Listen closely to me.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.429
This is an American spy
with no connection to Korea.

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.340
If you report him,

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:17.974
the two of you can escape.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.471
If Shimazaki finds out, you all die!

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.477
What was your real goal in coming here?

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:22.387
Sohee!

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:23.688
When I shout,

01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:26.187
run to Manager Shimazaki
and tell him everything!

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:27.643
He's on Shimazaki's side!

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:30.320
Goddamn fuckers!

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:32.610
Then when does the ship come?

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:33.861
Daddy!

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.320
Sohee, it's okay. Just stay still.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.326
Why do you take the girl!

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.497
Let go of her.

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:43.288
Drop the gun first.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:44.584
Sir, are you okay?

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.287
I'm fine, go watch over our men.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:48.542
Park has betrayed us!

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:50.169
Put down the gun, now!

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.750
Our men are on the way.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.756
Stop being stupid!

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:55.341
Try reading this.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.222
What kind of plot is this?

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.057
Shut up, you scoundrel!

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:01.344
Coming to save someone like you...

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:03.766
Don't you feel sorry for them?

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.057
Ito Takamichi Yoon Hak-chul...

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:14.273
I will report your treason to
the Provisional Government of Korea.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.829
You bastard!

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.637
Run, quick!

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.722
(This way, quick!)

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:29.932
(This way!)

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.642
(Hurry!)

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:41.444
(You Koreans, wait there!)

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:44.242
(Block the Koreans!)

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.918
(Shut the gate! Get in, quick!)

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:12.811
Help!

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:26.868
Sook, get up!

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:29.745
You want to die?

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:32.494
Let me go! Sook!

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:38.508
(Stop!)

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:40.718
(Don't shoot!)

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:42.842
(I'm Ito...)

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:49.887
Yoon Hak-chul!

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.418
Sir!

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.797
- Sir, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.173
Are you hurt?

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:24.095
How are you?

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:26.468
I'm okay. Let's get away from here.

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.300
About that account book...

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:31.603
Don't worry about that.
I'll go back and get it.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:35.520
Did you see what was in it?

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:41.233
Sir, I believe you to the end.

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:54.826
(Help!)

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:56.620
(Someone help!)

01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:58.500
(Help me!)

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.421
That man, he shot...

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.752
Quiet!

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:45.419
Sir, are you all right?

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:48.095
Sir, what will we do?

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:51.050
How could this happen to us?

01:18:56.732 --> 01:19:01.443
You there! Did Gang-ok die too?

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:05.906
Someone thought they saw his corpse,
so we're looking...

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:08.608
Gang-ok, where are you?

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:22.372
Dammit!

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.047
Daddy, I'm thirsty.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:38.930
Why are you giving me that?

01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:41.732
- Any food here?
- Probably.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:53.116
(Drive out the Koreans!)

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:57.324
(Drive out the Koreans!)

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.587
(Does the line work?)

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:07.756
(Hold out as long as you
can with the food and water you have.)

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:09.427
(Our manager's unrecoverable!)

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:10.754
(Are you telling us to just die?)

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:13.966
(Yesterday the U. S. dropped
a new bomb on Hiroshima!)

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:15.759
(A new bomb?)

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:17.469
(Word is coming in)

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:18.929
(that it's tremendously powerful.)

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.930
<i>(There's no official report yet, )</i>

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:23.187
(but it's said there are
100,000 casualties, )

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:26.816
<i>(and no living thing survived.)</i>

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:36.659
<i>(The Americans have
created something unimaginable.)</i>

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:46.624
(Are we going to lose this war?)

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:49.380
<i>(After Hitler's death and
the fall of Germany, )</i>

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:52.087
<i>(industrialists who helped the Nazis)</i>

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:55.174
<i>(are being lined up
and tried as war criminals.)</i>

01:20:55.267 --> 01:21:01.264
(If you have any materials that
can be used against us, burn them!)

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.895
(If it's a war crimes trial, )

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.398
(shouldn't we kill the Koreans
who could testify against us?)

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:09.775
(That'd be the most effective solution, )

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:12.024
(but with Shimazaki in that state, )

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:13.866
<i>(can it be done?)</i>

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.660
<i>(If you take care of things properly, )</i>

01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:23.960
<i>(then surely you can take his place.)</i>

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:29.833
(Drive out the Koreans!)

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:33.879
(Drive out the Koreans!)

01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:46.516
You little prick.

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:54.194
You ruined everything!

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.749
Does it hurt a lot?

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.763
I can't believe this.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:22.302
(Corpses will be burned to prevent disease, )

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.226
(so finish identifying the bodies!)

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:28.899
(What about Japanese corpses?)

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:33.442
(Why is it only us
who are burned like garbage?)

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.984
(So as not to create more panic, )

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:41.572
(for now, only you and I
must know of the manager's death.)

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:56.711
Take this for now.

01:22:57.723 --> 01:23:01.012
I couldn't find what you described,
so I just took anything.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:11.647
(I hear a Japanese schoolgirl was murdered.)

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:14.567
(Korean attendant Song
Jong-gu says he saw it.)

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.697
(And the suspect is Korean.)

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.782
(That's good news.)

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:24.072
(Now we have a justification
to crack down on the Koreans.)

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:30.704
Hey!

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:39.754
Hey!

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:41.510
Sohee!

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:43.884
Bro, you're alive?

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:45.263
You think I'm dead?

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:48.267
Why'd you want to meet here,
and not the kitchen?

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.399
There's someone
who can't know the two of us are alive.

01:23:51.985 --> 01:23:52.896
Have this.

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:55.649
What the hell? Eat this?

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.193
Hey, take a can from my bag.

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:00.445
It disappeared in the bombing.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.948
Huh? What about the cash?

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:05.450
All of it?

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:07.327
Goddammit!

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:11.411
It was a life-or-death situation!

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:13.918
Why didn't you get it? Where have you been?

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:17.333
It's a long story.

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:20.461
Is Yoon asking about me?

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:29.808
(Until the situation stabilizes, )

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:33.016
(I will carry out the duties
of our wounded manager.)

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:35.606
(During this vicious American attack)

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:38.154
(when everyone is heartbroken, )

01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:40.986
(an innocent, pretty young girl)

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:45.161
(lost her life to a savage
who couldn't control his lust!)

01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:48.619
(Can you see this innocent victim's family?)

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:50.541
(If you've any conscience, come forward!)

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:54.871
(What evidence do you have
that it was a Korean?)

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:57.874
(Witness, come forward!)

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:02.136
(Identify the suspect.)

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:15.312
He was with us yesterday!

01:25:15.402 --> 01:25:17.143
You scumbag!

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:29.572
Don't overdo it, you thug.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:38.965
Ah, I want some cold soy noodles!

01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:44.095
With savory broth... salt on top.

01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:46.715
I like it better with sugar.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.018
All right, sugar it is.

01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:54.931
Pull out a mouthful of those noodles...

01:25:57.903 --> 01:26:00.520
With radish kimchi on the side...

01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:06.485
Oh, let's stop this!

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:09.074
Only makes me hungrier.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:14.375
When we get out of here,
let's go eat noodles first.

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:19.206
Then, we'll go back home?

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:21.336
Of course.

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:24.962
That's why your dad is helping me.

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.888
But right now...

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:31.217
there's something I need you to help me with.

01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:34.311
Will you help me?

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.931
(Mr. Yoon.)

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:40.815
(If you get a chance to leave this island,
you'll take it?)

01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:44.105
(If I take you to the U. S. occupied zone, )

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.987
(can you tell them I helped you
to look after the laborers, )

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:50.161
(and supported Korean liberation?)

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:54.787
(If the manager is dead,
you'll probably get his position.)

01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:57.209
(Is that really necessary?)

01:26:57.379 --> 01:26:59.336
(I've thought it over, )

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:03.087
(and we're both smart enough to know)

01:27:03.427 --> 01:27:05.965
(how this war will end.)

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.713
(In return for getting you out, )

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:13.225
(give me the money
you pocketed with the manager.)

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:16.304
(Can I leave right away?)

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.932
(The coal transport ship is almost repaired.)

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:20.691
(Our communications are back, )

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:23.144
(and it's no problem to
leave here with you, )

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:27.114
(but if I want to take
my family from Nagasaki, )

01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:29.654
(I'll have to follow
the head office's command, )

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:33.284
(and deal with all the Koreans.)

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.081
(Deal with?)

01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:43.957
<i>(No Korean who remembers what happened here)</i>

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:46.550
<i>(must be allowed to survive.)</i>

01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:50.672
Where did that old man Yoon hide it?

01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:04.143
"Records of Korean laborers"

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:25.165
You lost your position as the Korean leader,

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:30.378
and took out your grudge
against a Japanese girl.

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.259
But she fought back,

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:35.592
and you strangled her.

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:39.269
Is that so hard to admit?

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:43.645
Hey! Just say it's true
and sign with your thumbprint.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:47.228
Then I'll treat you like my older brother.

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:49.817
Song Jong-gu...

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:53.242
I'm gonna fold you like a blanket,

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.704
and chop you into pieces, you prick.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:02.243
(Gather all the remaining dynamite!)

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:05.375
(Tomorrow we'll put
all the Koreans in the mine.)

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:08.340
Tomorrow morning...

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:12.921
Yamada plans to force all the Koreans
into the mine and kill us.

01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:16.094
Women of course, and even children.

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:26.396
I beg you.

01:29:30.073 --> 01:29:32.281
I won't ask for myself,

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:35.284
but please take Sohee away from here.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:44.581
Surely you can manage to take her.

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:49.665
I'm going to escape.

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.467
With all the Koreans here.

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:00.934
<i>In this place where we sweated and toiled,</i>

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:04.222
<i>we have a right to proper treatment!</i>

01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:08.981
Today's arrest of Choi Chil-sung
as a murder suspect

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:15.196
is no different from
what all us Koreans have suffered!

01:30:16.202 --> 01:30:17.409
Therefore I

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:19.870
requested Manager Shimazaki

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:23.116
to stop Koreans from being unfairly accused,

01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:26.668
and demanded an open trial!

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:32.750
- Out of the way.
- Let's go.

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:35.089
And furthermore,

01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:37.592
I reached an agreement with the manager.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:38.843
First!

01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:42.769
We will be given the same quality
food as the Japanese!

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:44.061
Second!

01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:47.766
The coal quotas raised last month
will be lowered!

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:48.565
Third!

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:51.269
Full time off on holidays!

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:52.519
Fourth!

01:30:52.822 --> 01:30:56.736
Work to repair the island
will be compensated!

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:00.908
And finally! Injured young workers
will all be returned...

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.364
to our homeland Korea!

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:06.413
We'll send them home!

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.711
There's just one condition!

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:15.214
Given what we will receive,

01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:17.970
we need to show our sincerity.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:23.009
Tomorrow is Hashima Mine's
first opening since the bombing.

01:31:23.436 --> 01:31:26.850
The manager has asked

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:29.933
as a show of our unity and for a new start,

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:33.940
that all Koreans including
women and children,

01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:37.983
join the opening ceremony inside the mine.

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:40.818
What do you all think?

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.278
I object!

01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:46.491
Yoon Hak-chul never met the manager today.

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:48.284
The manager is dead.

01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:50.373
If you enter the mine tomorrow,

01:31:50.547 --> 01:31:53.005
acting manager Yamada will have you buried.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:53.672
What?

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:56.341
Park Mu-young, stop trying to stir chaos!

01:31:56.428 --> 01:32:00.263
The U. S. has invaded Okinawa,
and the war is almost over.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:04.008
Yoon Hak-chul and Yamada
plan to bury you here

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:06.602
and then escape to the U. S. army.

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:07.724
Friends!

01:32:07.981 --> 01:32:11.474
That man is a spy trying
to divide us Koreans! A spy!

01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:13.150
All of you here

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:18.732
are decisive witnesses
of Hashima's war crimes.

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:20.483
Therefore, this company

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:24.454
plans to bury you in the mine
to destroy all evidence.

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:26.246
People!

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:27.998
Tell me!

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:29.499
Who do you trust?

01:32:29.586 --> 01:32:31.999
You fucker!

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:35.464
That old geezer is a real fox.

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:37.291
Listen up, everyone!

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:41.550
Park is an independence fighter
who came to rescue Yoon.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.008
But... if you can believe it,

01:32:45.143 --> 01:32:49.012
Park discovered that
Yoon was Shimazaki's informant.

01:32:49.105 --> 01:32:51.939
So Yoon shot him with a gun!

01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:54.107
And this here!

01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:56.277
Written by Yoon and the manager,

01:32:56.362 --> 01:33:00.732
lists all of the money
they skimmed off your paychecks.

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:04.614
People who died of accidents,
hunger, sickness, violence!

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:08.573
People who died trying to escape.
You stole their compensation!

01:33:08.666 --> 01:33:09.952
This man Lee Gang-ok!

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:14.166
To kiss up to the Japanese,
sold his own daughter!

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:16.463
And that spy

01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:20.008
is completely unknown to us,
coming from who knows where!

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:21.211
That's right!

01:33:21.387 --> 01:33:25.848
How do we know Gang-ok
and that newbie aren't spies?

01:33:26.893 --> 01:33:28.429
Calm down!

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.557
All of us need to band together!

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:33.355
Let's keep our heads and not be fooled!

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:36.934
These unknown guys coming in
and slandering our Mr. Yoon.

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:38.235
I saw it too!

01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:43.278
Put down the gun, now!
Our men are on the way.

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:44.776
I saw it!

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:48.697
<i>I saw you shoot him and Choong-ho too!</i>

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:51.578
Jang-woo, have you been bought off too?

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:54.243
Why betray your own country?

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:56.955
Do you really have to sell me?

01:33:57.048 --> 01:34:00.086
Stop it, Jang-woo! How could you do it too?

01:34:00.176 --> 01:34:02.213
What if I show you this?

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:07.848
4088 Yoon Hak-chul.

01:34:08.184 --> 01:34:11.018
Torn off your shirt by Choong-ho as he died.

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:15.477
Don't be fooled by appearances.

01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:17.732
They're deceiving you.

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:20.562
I saw it too! He's a bad man!

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.272
That girl saw such an awful thing?

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:25.904
First, let's look at those documents.

01:34:27.871 --> 01:34:29.783
Bleeding the people dry!

01:34:34.544 --> 01:34:37.787
You need to prove what they say isn't true.

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:39.497
Ito Takamichi! Yoon Hak-chul!

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:41.708
That money you worked for

01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:44.176
is dirty Japanese money!

01:34:44.262 --> 01:34:45.423
Guilty of treason.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:49.427
That money was for Korean independence!

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:50.428
Was that so wrong?

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.726
Bleeding the people dry!

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:53.893
It was for us!

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.393
Pretending to lead, and deceiving the people!

01:34:56.482 --> 01:34:57.689
You fools!

01:34:57.775 --> 01:34:58.811
For betraying the nation,

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:02.111
You think killing me will bring liberation?

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:03.320
I punish you in the name of Korea!

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:05.736
After all I've done!

01:35:25.511 --> 01:35:27.673
<i>So what are we going to do?</i>

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:30.677
No one's ever managed to escape here.

01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:33.100
Think we can all just hold hands and leave?

01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:36.679
Yoon has always tipped off the manager.

01:35:36.773 --> 01:35:38.480
That's why they failed.

01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:41.525
If we take the coal transport ship
in the harbor,

01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:43.690
- we can succeed.
- Wait a minute.

01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:46.313
Who's gonna drive that big ship?

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:50.026
Hold on, we got a few boatmen here.

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:53.908
I've sailed fishing boats.

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:57.041
I know the route, so with
5 or 6 men to row...

01:35:57.126 --> 01:35:58.287
Hold on!

01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:00.828
That freight ship is not a fishing boat!

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:03.756
It's not just that, if we all run for it

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:07.425
won't they start shooting and stabbing us?
What then?

01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:10.045
The guards who come to Hashima

01:36:10.139 --> 01:36:12.802
were all judged unfit for the battlefield.

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:16.177
And after the bombing, they're still spooked.

01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:18.512
There are much more of us.

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.972
And we got military training...

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:20.973
Instead,

01:36:21.067 --> 01:36:23.980
how about we try negotiating
with the Japanese?

01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:25.356
Right!

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:30.199
To be honest,
Japanese are more enlightened than us.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:31.571
If we try dialogue...

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:33.490
Dialogue my ass!

01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:37.415
If they were sensible,
would we be living this way?

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:42.086
Remember the Kanto Earthquake?
They spread rumors that

01:36:42.171 --> 01:36:46.165
Koreans poisoned the wells,
and massacred all Koreans!

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:49.218
You say that because you have skills
and lived easy!

01:36:49.304 --> 01:36:51.387
Who says I lived easy?

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.680
You're just trying to divide us, painter!

01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:54.927
Hey!

01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:57.308
Just decide who'd leave or stay!

01:36:57.395 --> 01:36:58.636
This is wasting time!

01:36:58.730 --> 01:36:59.971
He's right!

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:03.023
Those who want to go, can go.

01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:04.483
Those who will stay, stay.

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:08.271
You really think they'd kill so many people?

01:37:08.448 --> 01:37:09.734
- Right?
- Yeah!

01:37:09.824 --> 01:37:11.781
Daddy, aren't we going?

01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:16.070
Dammit, I'm gonna blow my top!

01:37:16.205 --> 01:37:18.492
You stupid Koreans!

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:21.917
If you made it this far,
shouldn't you try to live?

01:37:22.045 --> 01:37:26.005
Have you all grown so
used to being stepped on?

01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:29.754
This girl and I want to live!

01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:32.419
We'll go ourselves.

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:35.631
Wait! I'll go too.

01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:38.885
I lost my leg and became a cripple,

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:42.562
but I won't let them bury me here.

01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:46.688
But Mallyon, what if they really kill us all?

01:37:47.153 --> 01:37:51.113
Even if just one of us survives,
we win. Just one.

01:37:51.491 --> 01:37:55.701
My life was ruined,
but I won't die in their hands.

01:37:55.828 --> 01:37:57.114
Wait!

01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:01.619
I'll go too.

01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:24.430
<i>Are you really staying?</i>

01:38:24.524 --> 01:38:27.187
How can you trust them?
You should think it over.

01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:30.940
Come on, we'll try talking to the Japanese!

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:32.146
- Let's go!
- There's no time,

01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:33.613
so we won't try to persuade you.

01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:35.653
Are you crazy? What's going on?

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:39.407
You telling them of our plan is only trouble.

01:38:39.497 --> 01:38:40.908
So please understand.

01:38:40.998 --> 01:38:42.284
And besides,

01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:45.372
it'd be best if they found you tied up.

01:38:45.461 --> 01:38:49.045
Don't need this! Damn you, Jang-woo!

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:51.665
Careful, careful...

01:38:55.888 --> 01:38:58.631
Wait, I don't see Choi Chil-sung's gang.

01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:00.720
If they tell the labor attendant...

01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:03.678
They said they're going to rescue Choi.

01:39:03.813 --> 01:39:04.849
Huh?

01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:07.064
What'll they do then?

01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:09.358
Let's hurry.

01:39:17.243 --> 01:39:18.279
Boss!

01:39:19.036 --> 01:39:20.277
What are you doing here?

01:39:22.123 --> 01:39:26.493
They say they'll try you,
but let's go before things get worse.

01:39:26.586 --> 01:39:29.750
Think of this as a drill, like in training.

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:33.882
We're going to move in groups.

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:36.460
<i>When we're ready,</i>

01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:41.140
<i>women, the wounded and children
will move first at our sign.</i>

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.425
<i>Our final goal</i>

01:39:43.895 --> 01:39:46.854
<i>is to cross the coal belt over the wall,</i>

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:49.265
<i>board the ship and escape.</i>

01:39:50.776 --> 01:39:53.189
<i>This is dynamite they prepared for the mine.</i>

01:39:53.529 --> 01:39:56.146
<i>Explosives team,
tie them to the lantern batteries.</i>

01:39:56.282 --> 01:39:58.274
<i>It will strengthen the blast.</i>

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:02.410
<i>The wounded, use tatami mats to make shields.</i>

01:40:02.872 --> 01:40:07.082
<i>Mallyon and the women will
make rope from fundoshi underwear.</i>

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.500
<i>Weapons team, take tools and oil
from the tool factory.</i>

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:18.632
<i>Lee and his band will
gather bottles for bottle bombs.</i>

01:40:50.294 --> 01:40:54.129
Those who can steer the ship,
help me take control.

01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:58.880
The rest of you, wait for our signal.

01:41:00.805 --> 01:41:02.592
It's dangerous, don't touch!

01:41:02.682 --> 01:41:06.471
Why do you always yell at me?

01:41:53.816 --> 01:41:55.148
Why are you here?

01:41:56.485 --> 01:41:58.647
If you're ready, I'll bring everyone.

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:07.779
Don't do this, come with us.

01:42:08.247 --> 01:42:12.082
You really think 400 people
can sneak onto a ship?

01:42:12.251 --> 01:42:15.119
With all those wounded people?

01:42:15.212 --> 01:42:17.499
Then do you want to start a war here?

01:42:18.215 --> 01:42:20.707
We'll all die tomorrow anyway.

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:24.670
If you try to kill Jong-gu, you'll die too!

01:42:42.907 --> 01:42:44.068
Hey.

01:42:44.325 --> 01:42:46.567
Did Park go without finishing them off?

01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:48.653
They weren't here before.

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:50.070
Dammit!

01:42:58.547 --> 01:42:59.253
(Who's there?)

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.706
(It's me! Me!)

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.711
(Shishido, it's me.)

01:43:01.801 --> 01:43:02.757
(Gang-ok!)

01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:05.426
(Why are you out so late? Go back inside.)

01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:10.258
(I can't believe it either.)

01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:13.226
Get over here, quick!

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:18.523
(With the big event tomorrow, )

01:43:18.693 --> 01:43:20.685
(Yamada said to bring the girls
and pour everyone a drink.)

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.106
(Since you guys have it hardest, )

01:43:22.196 --> 01:43:23.983
(I brought some girls... you know?)

01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:25.109
(Really?)

01:43:25.408 --> 01:43:26.865
(Where's the alcohol from?)

01:43:26.951 --> 01:43:29.785
(Shimazaki had it stashed away, )

01:43:30.413 --> 01:43:31.995
(and Yamada took it out.)

01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:35.040
(Just one drink for each of you.)

01:43:35.126 --> 01:43:37.960
(If it's just one, better not to have any.)

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:40.879
(We'll give it a taste.)

01:43:41.298 --> 01:43:43.665
(Come this way.)

01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:03.769
Bro! Quickly!

01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:41.807
Women and the wounded first.

01:44:44.361 --> 01:44:46.899
<i>(Can we really do this?)</i>

01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:49.568
(I don't see any guards.)

01:44:49.658 --> 01:44:53.072
(I spent so much on Korean girls.)

01:44:53.204 --> 01:44:54.615
(If the manager finds out he'll be mad.)

01:44:54.705 --> 01:44:56.788
(Who will know we started the fire?)

01:44:56.874 --> 01:45:00.914
(They'll think the Koreans
kicked over a candle)

01:45:01.003 --> 01:45:03.086
(while they were sleeping.)

01:45:07.718 --> 01:45:10.461
Out of the way!

01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:11.840
Go back!

01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:15.507
Hey, it's women and the wounded first!

01:45:15.601 --> 01:45:17.058
I'm wounded too!

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:21.684
And she's a young girl,
shouldn't we board first?

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:24.687
Bro! Don't you have any shame?

01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:27.477
Take a look at these people!

01:45:31.492 --> 01:45:33.074
Dammit.

01:45:33.452 --> 01:45:36.991
Then at least let Sohee go first.

01:45:37.081 --> 01:45:38.617
No!

01:46:26.714 --> 01:46:28.421
Get up there, kid!

01:46:37.266 --> 01:46:38.848
The sun will be up soon.

01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:43.971
If you see a cripple go,
you can follow, right?

01:46:54.909 --> 01:46:57.993
You'll be fine if you follow me,

01:46:58.078 --> 01:46:59.740
so you come next.

01:47:00.748 --> 01:47:05.709
<i>Doong-ge, Doong-ge, Doong-ge.</i>

01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:10.710
<i>My baby Doong-ge...</i>

01:47:11.175 --> 01:47:15.590
<i>I am afraid of him being caught.</i>

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:20.340
<i>Don't cry, Doong-ge.</i>

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:26.055
<i>Will he ride in on the wind?</i>

01:47:26.565 --> 01:47:31.401
<i>Will he ride in on the clouds?</i>

01:47:31.987 --> 01:47:36.778
<i>Come without a sound.</i>

01:47:37.242 --> 01:47:42.237
<i>Come without a trace.</i>

01:47:42.581 --> 01:47:48.498
<i>We wanted to be together</i>

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:53.791
<i>We wanted to live as one</i>

01:47:54.259 --> 01:47:59.004
<i>If not in this world,</i>

01:47:59.515 --> 01:48:04.351
<i>I'll meet you in the next world.</i>

01:48:04.853 --> 01:48:09.644
<i>Doong-ge, Doong-ge, Doong-ge.</i>

01:48:10.234 --> 01:48:14.774
<i>My baby Doong-ge...</i>

01:48:15.447 --> 01:48:20.192
<i>I am afraid of him being caught.</i>

01:48:20.703 --> 01:48:25.073
<i>Don't cry, Doong-ge.</i>

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:34.797
(Get to the coal depository!)

01:48:35.009 --> 01:48:37.797
(The Koreans are escaping!)

01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:46.180
They've been spotted.

01:48:48.605 --> 01:48:51.143
I'll join you, so you go first.

01:48:52.067 --> 01:48:54.559
I keep my promises.

01:48:56.447 --> 01:49:00.191
As they board the ship,
we'll watch their backs.

01:49:07.249 --> 01:49:09.366
You guys in the front, move!

01:50:04.014 --> 01:50:07.348
(The Koreans started a fire!)

01:50:08.227 --> 01:50:10.594
(The Koreans are escaping!)

01:50:24.785 --> 01:50:27.027
(Check the back! Quickly!)

01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:40.339
Don't move in the back!

01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:14.699
Snipers! Explosives!

01:51:37.107 --> 01:51:38.393
Hold on!

01:52:20.984 --> 01:52:22.725
(It's a real war!)

01:52:23.153 --> 01:52:25.145
(Kill every last one of them!)

01:52:41.463 --> 01:52:44.126
You rotten bastards!

01:53:01.066 --> 01:53:04.059
Sohee, stay right here!

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:14.031
(Kill every one of them!)

01:53:29.344 --> 01:53:32.303
(Stop shooting! That way!)

01:53:43.233 --> 01:53:45.441
Let's go home!

01:53:46.153 --> 01:53:54.198
I said this would never work!
From the very start!

01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:59.664
Sohee! Hide, quickly!

01:53:59.875 --> 01:54:01.207
Go back, you!

01:54:02.336 --> 01:54:04.123
It's dangerous here!

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:19.509
Lift! With all your strength!

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.894
Go over the wall and into the water!

01:54:22.022 --> 01:54:23.684
Snipers and explosive team, move!

01:54:23.815 --> 01:54:25.647
The rest of you, lift!

01:54:33.325 --> 01:54:35.408
Light them here!

01:54:37.412 --> 01:54:41.326
Let's fight to death!

01:54:47.422 --> 01:54:50.415
1, 2, 3...!

01:55:07.984 --> 01:55:09.850
Dae-yeop!

01:55:16.201 --> 01:55:19.490
1, 2, 3...!

01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:25.284
Lift it!

01:55:29.923 --> 01:55:30.754
Lift it!

01:55:30.924 --> 01:55:31.755
Lift!

01:55:35.262 --> 01:55:38.721
Sohee, hide here!

01:55:40.142 --> 01:55:42.179
Follow me, guys!

01:55:52.737 --> 01:55:54.854
Bring this!

01:55:57.325 --> 01:55:58.861
Help me!

01:56:01.413 --> 01:56:03.245
Spread it out!

01:56:03.457 --> 01:56:06.666
Spread it out!

01:56:10.839 --> 01:56:12.330
Throw!

01:56:16.845 --> 01:56:19.053
Grab the rope and follow me!

01:56:25.353 --> 01:56:27.345
(Bullets! I'm out of bullets!)

01:56:27.439 --> 01:56:28.930
(Bayonets!)

01:56:29.024 --> 01:56:30.356
Charge!

01:56:33.236 --> 01:56:37.355
Bastards! We don't deserve this!

01:56:37.949 --> 01:56:39.030
Daddy!

01:56:39.242 --> 01:56:43.111
Get back there Sohee, it's dangerous!

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:50.625
Pull the rope!

01:57:14.611 --> 01:57:15.692
Pull out!

01:57:17.656 --> 01:57:20.569
Chil-sung, you asshole!

01:57:21.409 --> 01:57:23.696
Come back here, bastard!

01:57:27.332 --> 01:57:28.448
Pull it back, quick!

01:57:28.542 --> 01:57:29.407
Pull it back!

01:57:32.462 --> 01:57:34.624
(What are you holding back for?)

01:57:34.714 --> 01:57:36.125
(Move!)

01:57:38.969 --> 01:57:40.050
Pull the rope!

01:57:45.016 --> 01:57:46.257
Pull!

01:57:48.019 --> 01:57:49.510
Now push it!

01:57:49.688 --> 01:57:51.930
A little more!

01:57:52.232 --> 01:57:53.564
Lift it up!

01:57:54.234 --> 01:57:55.566
Push!

01:57:56.194 --> 01:57:57.810
That's it!

01:58:02.284 --> 01:58:03.240
Climb up!

01:58:03.326 --> 01:58:04.658
Everyone climb up!

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:07.157
Let the wounded climb up!

01:58:07.289 --> 01:58:08.951
Sohee, where are you?

01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:10.030
Daddy!

01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:39.777
Hey!

01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:48.869
Come on guys!

01:58:49.289 --> 01:58:50.746
Get up!

01:59:10.518 --> 01:59:12.305
Bastard!

02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:17.913
Sorry for not keeping my promise.

02:00:26.261 --> 02:00:28.048
You can rest now.

02:00:40.233 --> 02:00:42.395
(I'm on your side!)

02:00:42.652 --> 02:00:45.645
(Kill all the Koreans,
whatever side they're on!)

02:00:54.539 --> 02:00:58.249
- Bro! What do we do?
- Keep climbing!

02:00:58.668 --> 02:01:00.660
Sung-il!

02:01:13.725 --> 02:01:15.717
Sung-il!

02:01:15.977 --> 02:01:17.309
Lee Gang-ok!

02:01:26.821 --> 02:01:27.902
Sohee, stay there!

02:01:27.989 --> 02:01:29.400
Stay there!

02:01:43.171 --> 02:01:45.208
Daddy! Daddy!

02:01:46.382 --> 02:01:48.294
(I've got you now!)

02:01:55.517 --> 02:01:56.928
(Dirty Koreans!)

02:01:57.018 --> 02:01:58.475
(Damn you!)

02:01:59.229 --> 02:02:02.063
(Why aren't you grateful?)

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:03.309
(Why!)

02:02:46.401 --> 02:02:48.358
(It's all over now!)

02:02:51.114 --> 02:02:52.946
(Your manager is dead!)

02:02:53.116 --> 02:02:54.698
(Your supervisor's dead, )

02:02:55.285 --> 02:02:57.026
(and so is Yamada!)

02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:03.703
(Now we're going back)

02:03:04.419 --> 02:03:06.502
(to our home!)

02:03:25.481 --> 02:03:26.892
Daddy...

02:04:43.017 --> 02:04:45.555
I'm not going to die.

02:04:46.437 --> 02:04:48.053
Why are you crying?

02:04:49.273 --> 02:04:50.514
Stop!

02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:54.567
Go over there, Sohee.

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:04.320
I'm older, so let me ask you a favor.

02:05:07.208 --> 02:05:11.873
Give her some soy noodles with sugar.

02:05:14.007 --> 02:05:16.124
That's what she likes best.

02:05:35.028 --> 02:05:40.740
Please look after my girl.

02:06:05.767 --> 02:06:08.885
Sorry I couldn't give you anything.

02:06:23.326 --> 02:06:29.573
Don't turn your nose up at raw eggs.

02:06:35.671 --> 02:06:38.755
Sing a song for me.

02:06:46.224 --> 02:06:48.466
Daddy, Daddy!

02:06:48.559 --> 02:06:51.267
Daddy!

02:06:51.896 --> 02:06:54.513
You said you wouldn't die!

02:06:54.816 --> 02:06:58.025
You promised!
