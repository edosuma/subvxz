All: 3, 2, 1.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.814
[FLUSHING]

10:59.200 --> 11:01.410
{\an1}DIDN'T I TELL YOU IT WAS
A SILLY RUMOR?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.079
[RUMBLING]

11:08.209 --> 11:10.044
HA HA HA HA.
SEE YOU, SWEENEY.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.505
OOH!

11:15.174 --> 11:18.594
OPEN IT!
OPEN IT!

11:18.677 --> 11:20.346
Sweeney: COME ON, MAN.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.767
OH...

11:24.850 --> 11:29.313
Both: AAAH!

11:35.778 --> 11:38.739
Cookie: THE SCHOOL DIDN'T EVEN
HOP INTO THE AIR.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.408
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT DIDN'T WORK.

11:40.491 --> 11:43.953
{\an1}Sweeney: DIDN'T WORK?
WOOHOO!

11:44.036 --> 11:45.663
I DEFINITELY FELT THE SCHOOL

11:45.746 --> 11:46.664
HOP INTO THE AIR.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.458
OH, YEAH!
AT LEAST A FOOT.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.087
{\an5}MAYBE MORE!
OH, THAT WAS
AN ATOMIC FLUSH.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.296
BOOM!

11:54.380 --> 11:56.465
OH, WAIT TILL
THE NIGHT GUY SEES THIS.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.883
[BOTH LAUGH]

11:57.967 --> 12:00.219
{\an1}Boy: YEAH.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.262
{\an1}MAYBE I DID
FEEL SOMETHING.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.306
YEAH. I FELT IT, TOO.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.600
IT WAS KIND OF A THUMP.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.352
A FOOT OFF THE GROUND!
WE DID IT!

12:08.436 --> 12:09.562
All: YEAH!

12:09.645 --> 12:10.771
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

12:14.400 --> 12:17.153
RUMORS. SOMETIMES THEY'RE FUN,

12:17.236 --> 12:19.613
BUT USUALLY THEY ARE
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.824
{\an8}SO DON'T BELIEVE THEM
AND DON'T SPREAD THEM.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.626
SCHOOL PHOTOS.
YOUR MOM ALWAYS LOVES THEM,

12:32.710 --> 12:34.420
NO MATTER HOW THEY TURN OUT,

12:34.503 --> 12:37.715
BUT YOU WANT YOUR BEST PHOTO
ON THE PHOTO WALL.

12:38.799 --> 12:43.053
{\an4}HERE ARE SOME TIPS
ON HOW TO AVOID
COMMON MISTAKES.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.680
{\an7}DON'T TALK WHEN
THE PICTURE'S TAKEN,

12:44.763 --> 12:46.640
{\an8}OR YOU MIGHT LOOK LIKE THIS.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.643
{\an8}OH, AND TRY NOT TO BLINK.

12:49.727 --> 12:53.022
{\an8}THIS ONE'S SELF-EXPLANATORY.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.524
{\an1}AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO JUST AREN'T COMFORTABLE

12:55.608 --> 12:57.318
HAVING THEIR PICTURES TAKEN.

12:57.401 --> 13:00.279
{\an1}I AM NOT TAKING ANY MORE
SCHOOL PHOTOS, EVER.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.796
WELL, I CAN TELL BY YOUR
UNUSUALLY CIVILIZED APPEARANCE

13:17.880 --> 13:21.050
{\an1}THAT YOU ALL REMEMBERED
TODAY IS SCHOOL PHOTO DAY.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.010
HA HA.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.929
MOZE, IT'S PHOTO DAY.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.056
{\an1}WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE A SLOB?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.891
I'M NOT HAVING
MY PICTURE TAKEN.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.226
YOU'VE SEEN MY PICTURES.
THEY ALWAYS STINK.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.187
NOT AS BAD AS MINE.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.605
{\an1}I'M THE STINKING
SCHOOL PHOTO KING.

13:34.688 --> 13:39.401
{\an7}I'VE GOT CAUGHT SNEEZING,
YAWNING, SCRATCHING.

13:39.485 --> 13:43.072
{\an8}THEN LAST YEAR I SAT FROZEN
WITH A PERFECT SMILE,

13:43.155 --> 13:45.950
{\an8}BUT MY SHIRT WAS THE SAME COLOR
AS THE BACKDROP, SO...

13:46.033 --> 13:49.453
{\an5}HEY, IT'S FLOATING HEAD
KID BOY.
HA HA HA HA.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.250
{\an1}BUT THIS YEAR
I HAVE THE PLAN

13:54.333 --> 13:55.876
{\an1}TO TAKE
THE PERFECT PHOTO.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.586
THIS YEAR, I PLAN
TO TAKE THE WOLF.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.756
THE "NO PICTURE
AVAILABLE" WOLF.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.300
NO, NO.
DO NOT TAKE THE WOLF.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.136
{\an1}I WILL GET YOU THE BEST
PICTURE OF YOUR LIFE.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.556
{\an5}YOU THINK IT'S EASY
BECAUSE THE CAMERA
LOVES YOU.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.849
YOU EVEN LOOK GREAT
WITH YOUR MESSY HAIR.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.851
IT'S ALL ABOUT PREPARATION.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.271
A SCHOOL PHOTO TAKES PRACTICE.

14:15.354 --> 14:20.985
{\an1}LIKE THE SHIRT, THE SMILE,
AND THE PERFECTLY MESSY HAIR.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.861
Boy: NED! BUDDY!

14:22.945 --> 14:24.071
{\an1}HOW'S ABOUT ONE FOR
THE YEARBOOK?

14:26.615 --> 14:28.200
Gordy: [INDISTINCT]

14:29.702 --> 14:31.203
GORDY, SHUT IT OFF!

14:31.287 --> 14:32.955
{\an5}WHAT?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.955
Boy: NO, DON'T.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.456
{\an1}IT'S PERFECT.
JUST SWELL.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.293
THE CAMERA LOVES YA.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.089
{\an5}SEE? FOR YOU,
EVERY PICTURE
IS PERFECT.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.717
HEY, SCOOP, HOW ABOUT
ONE OF MOZE?

14:47.219 --> 14:49.096
OUCH.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.766
{\an1}WELL, UH,

14:52.850 --> 14:56.520
{\an1}MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.
GOT TO SKEDADDLE.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.736
{\an1}I SHOULD NEVER
BE PHOTOGRAPHED.

15:03.819 --> 15:04.778
I CAN'T SMILE.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.780
I SEE YOU SMILE
ALL THE TIME.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.198
YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL SMILE.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.450
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.246
FOR A CAMERA TO--

15:14.330 --> 15:15.331
LIKE, LIKE IN A PICTURE.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.874
SURE.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.626
I CAN SMILE FOR
YOU AND COOKIE,

15:18.709 --> 15:20.085
{\an1}BUT WHEN I GET IN FRONT
OF THAT CAMERA GUY,

15:20.169 --> 15:21.045
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

15:21.128 --> 15:21.712
HEY, I'M GOING TO
GET YOU

15:21.795 --> 15:24.465
THE BEST PHOTO
OF YOUR LIFE.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.176
FIRST, YOU NEED
BETTER CLOTHES.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.765
OOPS, SORRY, GUYS.
IT'S PILLOW DAY.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.683
I MEAN, THIS IS
A NICE BLOUSE HERE,

15:34.767 --> 15:37.186
BUT IT WON'T BE READY
TILL FRIDAY.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.562
I DIDN'T MAKE THAT.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.190
IT'S PERFECT.
WE'LL TAKE IT.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.525
HERE ARE SOME TIPS
TO MAKE SURE

15:43.609 --> 15:45.527
YOU GET A SCHOOL PHOTO
TO BE PROUD OF.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.657
{\an8}FIRST, REMEMBER YOU ONLY
HAVE TO DRESS UP

15:49.740 --> 15:51.116
WHAT THE CAMERA SEES.

15:52.868 --> 15:56.205
Ned: SO PANTS DON'T COUNT,
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO WEAR THEM.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.539
SMILE.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.541
FINE. PERFECT.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.086
{\an7}Ned: FOR THE BEST PHOTO,
DRESS LIKE YOURSELF,

16:02.169 --> 16:03.712
NOT LIKE SOMEONE YOU SAW ON TV.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.589
Photographer: SMILE.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.215
SMILE.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.176
FINE. PERFECT.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.428
WONDERFUL.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.226
{\an8}Ned: THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
PRACTICING A SMILE...

16:18.644 --> 16:19.978
{\an8}ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE
UNCOMFORTABLE POSING.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.498
{\an5}IT'S HOPELESS.
I CAN'T SMILE
UNDER PRESSURE.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.125
WHAT PRESSURE?
THERE'S NO PRESSURE.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.962
LET'S PRACTICE FOR
THE REAL CAMERA.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.800
{\an5}SHE CAN BORROW MY CAMERA.
JUST LET ME GET
ONE TEST PHOTO.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.055
LOOKS BAD, RIGHT?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.974
{\an1}BUT THAT'S
NO PROBLEM ANYMORE.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.517
I CAN FIX ANY DIGITAL PHOTO

16:58.600 --> 17:00.477
WITH MY PERFECT PHOTO PROGRAM.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.603
YOU SEE, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS

17:01.687 --> 17:05.190
{\an1}PLUG INTO THE FIREWIRE ...
OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S CAMERA,

17:05.273 --> 17:07.943
{\an1}AND WE'LL GET
THE PERFECT COOKIE.

17:08.026 --> 17:10.112
COOL. GIMME.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.289
WHERE'S THE FIREWIRE
PORT ON THIS THING?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.708
{\an5}FIREWIRE?
I WOULDN'T BE
CAUGHT DEAD

17:22.790 --> 17:24.292
WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA.

17:24.376 --> 17:28.464
FILM, KID.
SWEET EMULSION.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.632
THAT'S PHOTOGRAPHY.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.134
OOPS.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.636
{\an5}LOOKS LIKE SOME KIDS
ARE GOING TO BE
TAKING THE WOLF.

17:35.804 --> 17:36.638
OH--OH, NO!

17:36.722 --> 17:40.476
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
THINK.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.313
{\an1}THAT PHOTOGRAPHER
DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.482
{\an1}I COULD'VE SET
A LIVE BEAR UP THERE.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.192
{\an1}HE WOULD'VE TAKEN
HIS PICTURE

17:48.275 --> 17:49.693
AND PUT MY NAME ON IT.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.868
{\an8}YOU'LL FEEL
LESS PRESSURE HAVING
YOUR PICTURE TAKEN

17:57.951 --> 18:00.829
{\an8}IF YOU'RE USED TO
BEING AROUND A CAMERA.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.123
REMEMBER, THE CAMERA'S
YOUR FRIEND.

18:03.207 --> 18:03.749
{\an1}HEY! HERE'S YOUR FRIEND
OVER HERE.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.085
{\an1}RIGHT? YEAH?
SMILE. COME ON.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.795
COME ON.
GIVE ME A SMILE. YEAH.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.339
{\an5}NOW, GIVE ME--
YOU'RE A TIGER!
YOU'RE A--GRR.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.841
{\an1}HEY? HEY, HEY.
I'M OVER HERE. SMILE.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.844
WHO COULD SMILE WITH YOU
BUZZING AROUND LIKE A MOSQUITO?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.596
COME ON, MOZE.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.514
WORK WITH ME HERE.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.724
YES. LOVING IT.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.435
{\an1}ALL RIGHT, JUST THINK
HAPPY THOUGHTS.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.686
I'M GOING TO PUNCH YOU.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.274
{\an1}THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR THAT IN HERE.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.026
STORE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

18:31.109 --> 18:33.987
{\an5}FORGET IT.
FORGET IT, LEAVE IT.
I'LL DO IT.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.201
SEE THE FUTURE
IN MY BEANS?

18:39.284 --> 18:40.369
I SEE CHICKEN.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.079
{\an5}IN MY FUTURE?

18:40.452 --> 18:42.079
IT'S IN THE BEANS.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.330
THERE'S CHICKEN
IN THE BEANS?

18:43.413 --> 18:44.581
{\an1}I'LL HAVE THE CHICKEN
WITH BEANS.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.166
NO CHICKEN IN THE BEANS!
PORK!

18:46.250 --> 18:47.167
IN MY FUTURE?

18:47.251 --> 18:50.170
OOH, YOU GOT
THE PRETTIEST SMILE.

18:50.254 --> 18:50.295
NEXT!

18:53.757 --> 18:55.884
{\an5}I THINK WE SHOULD START
BRINGING OUR LUNCH
FROM HOME.

18:55.968 --> 18:56.343
YEAH.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.849
THERE'S A BEAUTY SHOT
FOR THIS WEEK'S SCHOOL PAPER.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.393
"BIGBY BOY BUYS BEANS."

19:04.476 --> 19:06.854

19:13.318 --> 19:15.904
{\an5}OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST FORGET
ABOUT POSING.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.906
I'LL MAKE YOU SMILE,
NATURALLY.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.241
I'LL TELL JOKES.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.790

19:27.499 --> 19:29.543

19:34.131 --> 19:34.756

19:34.840 --> 19:36.717
{\an1}IF I DON'T MAKE IT
TO GYM ON TIME,

19:36.800 --> 19:38.635
DIRGA'S GOING TO KILL ME.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.263
A BIT BIGGER.

19:41.346 --> 19:46.059
{\an5}THEY GAVE ME THE LOCKER
AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE.
OH, NO.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.311
TONE IT DOWN JUST A BIT.

19:47.394 --> 19:50.314
{\an1}THEY GAVE ME THE LOCKER
AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE.

19:50.397 --> 19:50.939
GRR. OH, NO!

19:51.023 --> 19:52.482
I'M NOT FEELING THE COOKIE.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.651

19:54.735 --> 19:55.903

19:55.986 --> 19:57.571
MORE EMOTION.

19:57.654 --> 19:58.947
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL ME.

19:59.031 --> 19:59.948
OH, MY.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.791

IS THERE NO ONE WHO CAN CAPTURE

20:09.875 --> 20:11.877
THE REAL INNER ME?

20:13.670 --> 20:15.923
{\an1}HI. I'M HERE TO READ FOR
THE ROLE OF COOKIE.

20:16.006 --> 20:19.426

PERFECT. FINE.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.858
AHEM. YOU CAN'T
PUT THAT THERE.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.526
I ALREADY DID,

20:36.610 --> 20:37.903
AND THEY'RE GOING TO
STAY HERE

20:37.986 --> 20:40.072
UNLESS YOU WANT TO
BALANCE THEM

20:40.155 --> 20:41.323
ON THE TOP OF
YOUR HEAD.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.076
NO. SMILE.
WONDERFUL.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.080
YOU'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.
GIVE UP.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.625
{\an1}DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE GOING TO SMILE.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.172
{\an1}SO IS THIS FOR
A PLAY OR A FILM?

20:57.255 --> 21:00.968
IT'S MORE IN THE NATURE
OF PERSONAL APPEARANCE.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.469
UHH!

21:04.554 --> 21:06.223
OK, GET READY TO SMILE.
