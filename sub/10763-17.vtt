WEBVTT

00:09.075 --> 00:11.066
(thunder crashing)

00:16.082 --> 00:17.071
(doorbell ringing)

00:19.586 --> 00:21.087
Oh, Niles, thank God
you came quickly.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.589
I've been going mad.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.591
This better be a real emergency,
Frasier.

00:24.591 --> 00:27.594
You pulled me away from the
'Gifted Infant Toy' Expo.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.596
Yes, yes, so you missed
out on buying

00:29.596 --> 00:30.585
a Tickle Me Tolstoy doll.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.600
Niles, my problem is
more important than that.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.101
You see, I've...

00:35.101 --> 00:37.103
Oh, dear God!

00:37.103 --> 00:38.605
Niles, I've committed a crime.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.106
Don't tell me...

00:40.106 --> 00:42.609
you forgot to send
the Opera Board a thank you note

00:42.609 --> 00:43.598
for the Christmas brickle.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.613
By God, man, it's a real crime.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.415
Punishable by law!

00:48.415 --> 00:50.212
(thunder crashing)

00:51.651 --> 00:52.719
By law?

00:52.719 --> 00:55.085
Of the United States of America.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.722
(thunder crashing)

00:59.559 --> 01:00.548
Heavens, what have you done?

01:01.261 --> 01:02.262
I'll tell you.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.563
But before you
judge me, Niles, please,

01:04.563 --> 01:07.567
remember how much stress
I've been under lately.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.269
Of course.

01:09.269 --> 01:11.271
Tell me everything.
Leave nothing out.

01:11.271 --> 01:14.138
All right...
It was a dark and stormy day...

01:14.274 --> 01:16.843
You can leave that out.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.845
All right.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.346
It was an average day,

01:20.346 --> 01:22.348
marred only
by a persistent cough,

01:22.348 --> 01:26.352
caused by a barista's
over-nutmegging my machiatto.

01:26.352 --> 01:27.341
Go ahead, Babette.

01:27.854 --> 01:28.354
What can I do for you?

01:28.354 --> 01:29.844
Well, Dr. Crane,

01:30.323 --> 01:33.781
for about a year now,
I've been... stealing.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.696
I get these uncontrollable urges
to take things.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.198
Such as?

01:38.198 --> 01:40.291
(coughs)

01:40.467 --> 01:41.234
All kinds of things.

01:41.234 --> 01:42.223
Magazines from stores,

01:42.535 --> 01:43.536
a friend's sunglasses.

01:43.536 --> 01:45.238
Things I don't even want.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.239
I see, um...

01:46.239 --> 01:47.240
(clears throat)

01:47.240 --> 01:48.441
Go on.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.876
It's just so unlike me.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.377
I mean,
my friends think I'm dull.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.880
They all say, "Babette,
you're like an old shoe. "

01:53.880 --> 01:55.381
But stealing is so exciting.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.884
It's really the only time I feel alive.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.386
Well, it sounds to me
like you have a classic case

02:00.386 --> 02:01.375
of klepto--...

02:01.888 --> 02:02.889
(coughing)

02:02.889 --> 02:03.890
klepto--...

02:03.890 --> 02:04.788
(coughing)

02:05.258 --> 02:06.159
Kleptomania.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.895
Hi, Babette.
This is Roz.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.698
And if Dr. Crane weren't
hacking up a hairball,

02:11.698 --> 02:13.199
I'm sure he would tell you

02:13.199 --> 02:15.190
that this thrill you get
from stealing

02:15.702 --> 02:17.704
makes up for an emptiness
in your life.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.573
That's the problem you
really need to address.

02:20.573 --> 02:22.442
So, you should seek counseling

02:22.442 --> 02:24.307
or at least find
a support group.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.212
Yes, and may I add...

02:26.212 --> 02:28.281
She's gone and
we're out of time. Oh.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.771
Well, then,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane

02:30.283 --> 02:32.274
saying "Good day, Seattle,
and good mental health. "

02:33.286 --> 02:34.275
Are you okay?

02:34.787 --> 02:36.289
I haven't heard
so much coughing

02:36.289 --> 02:38.691
since I was backstage
at Reggae Sunsplash.

02:38.691 --> 02:40.260
Well... (clears throat)...
I'm fine, Roz.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.261
Thank you, thank you so much.

02:41.261 --> 02:42.762
Your advice was spot on.

02:42.762 --> 02:44.264
It should be.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.765
I've heard you say the
same stuff for ten years now.

02:45.765 --> 02:49.269
"Confront your emotions, "
"communicate, "

02:49.269 --> 02:50.497
"seek counseling. "

02:51.304 --> 02:52.605
I didn't realize my advice
had become so predictable.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.307
Well, it's not
your fault

02:54.307 --> 02:56.298
everyone calls with
the same dumb-ass problems.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.601
They're not
the same problems.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.614
What about
that caller last week--

03:01.614 --> 03:03.616
the sleepwalking transvestite

03:03.616 --> 03:06.619
that kept breaking off his heels
on sewer grates?

03:06.619 --> 03:07.620
I remember him.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.756
You told him to seek counseling.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.815
Yes, I also told him
to wear flats.

03:13.326 --> 03:14.827
Oh, oh, did
Maintenance remember

03:14.827 --> 03:16.329
to bring me
that hammer I asked for?

03:16.329 --> 03:17.330
Oh, yeah, right here.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.831
What do you need it for?

03:18.831 --> 03:20.333
Some imbecile's
been parking in my spot

03:20.333 --> 03:21.322
despite several
strongly worded notes

03:21.834 --> 03:23.336
I have left on his windshield.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.338
The time has come
for me to take matters
into my own hands.

03:25.338 --> 03:26.828
NILES:
My God, Frasier,
so that's what you did.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.274
In an uncontrollable rage

03:28.274 --> 03:30.643
over the commandeering
of your parking space,

03:30.643 --> 03:31.644
you took hammer to car.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.635
You are a vandal.

03:40.286 --> 03:41.719
It was nothing
like that.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.725
My reserved sign was a-dangle.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.717
I used the hammer
to tack it back up.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.232
I'm sorry.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.734
I didn't realize
this spot was reserved.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.237
So all those notes
that I left...

03:57.237 --> 03:59.739
must have...

03:59.739 --> 04:02.503
blown away. Hello.

04:02.775 --> 04:03.843
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

04:03.843 --> 04:04.832
Yes.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.346
So you know my show.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.335
It's on your sign.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.350
Willa Haver.

04:10.350 --> 04:11.851
I'm so sorry.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.353
My assigned spot is on the roof,
and with the rain...

04:13.353 --> 04:14.843
Oh, no, no,
it's perfectly
understandable.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.255
And now that I know
that this is your Audi,

04:18.757 --> 04:22.262
let me be the first
to say, "Audi, neighbor."

04:22.262 --> 04:24.464
NILES: And that's when

04:24.464 --> 04:25.988
she took the hammer
and put you out of your misery.

04:26.466 --> 04:29.335
That would have
been preferable.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.337
You know, in the
spirit of detente,

04:31.337 --> 04:34.340
I... I could, uh,
buy you some coffee.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.843
Oh, well, that is so sweet
of you,

04:36.843 --> 04:38.333
but I can't right now.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.647
Well, perhaps tomorrow.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.382
Uh, no,
tomorrow's no good either.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.683
Next week, perhaps?

04:43.683 --> 04:45.685
Next week
I'll be out of town.

04:45.685 --> 04:46.674
You know, I'm not sure

04:47.387 --> 04:48.688
if we're hav
ing a devil of a time

04:48.688 --> 04:50.383
coordinating our schedules

04:50.690 --> 04:52.385
or if you're giving
me a polite brush-off.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.422
(car alarm chirping)

04:56.696 --> 04:57.685
Okay.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.697
Now I'm sure.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.410
FRASIER:
My morning's travails aside,
Niles,

05:10.410 --> 05:11.878
you'll be happy to know

05:11.878 --> 05:12.879
I didn't strike out with every woman

05:12.879 --> 05:14.369
I encountered today.

05:14.881 --> 05:15.381
Frasier...
Hm?

05:15.381 --> 05:17.383
I heard the elevator
and I thought,

05:17.383 --> 05:19.886
"I bet that's Frasier,"'
and it is.

05:19.886 --> 05:20.887
How are you,
Mrs. Magrini?

05:20.887 --> 05:22.889
Oh, just grand

05:22.889 --> 05:25.391
and how many times do I have
to ask you to call me Opal?

05:25.391 --> 05:26.881
You make me feel
like an old woman.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.461
Opal, then.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.762
Lovely to see you again.

05:29.762 --> 05:31.457
Some weather.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.467
Yes, it's just awful.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.470
It's blowing a gale.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.472
Yes, it's quite a storm.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.771
And colder than
a well-digger's wallet.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.779
Yes, that's quite apt.

05:46.779 --> 05:49.782
I wonder
if I could ask a favor.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.785
I know you're probably as busyas an ant farm,

05:52.785 --> 05:56.489
but do you think you could
change a light bulb for me?

05:56.489 --> 05:58.124
The last time I tried,

05:58.124 --> 06:02.028
I fell off the ladder
and I lay on my back like...

06:02.028 --> 06:03.930
Like a helpless turtle?

06:03.930 --> 06:08.560
No, like a half hour,
till the ambulance came.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.107
Well, um, let me just get out
of these wet shoes

06:14.107 --> 06:15.608
and I'll be right over.

06:15.608 --> 06:16.976
Oh, great.

06:16.976 --> 06:17.977
I'll make some tea
and cookies.

06:17.977 --> 06:21.481
We always have
such lively conversations.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.972
Yes, we're reviving a lost art.

06:26.486 --> 06:27.987
Hey, Fras.

06:27.987 --> 06:29.978
Some weather, huh?

06:30.990 --> 06:32.992
Yes, it's raining.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.483
I've just gone over that
with Mrs. Magrini.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.485
Hey, come look at these pictures
from our engagement party.

06:37.997 --> 06:41.000
Yeah, that camera you gave me
is terrific.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.503
What, is that the camera
I gave you ten years ago?

06:43.503 --> 06:44.970
I can't believe

06:45.471 --> 06:45.960
you've never
used it before.

06:46.472 --> 06:47.473
Shows you what you know.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.976
Turns out half the shots
on this roll

06:49.976 --> 06:51.477
were taken the night
you gave it to me.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.979
Niles,

06:52.979 --> 06:54.469
come and look
at these old pictures.

06:54.981 --> 06:55.970
NILES:
Yes, and then we all looked
at the pictures.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.918
I remember it as if
it were four hours ago.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.909
I am coming to my point.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.410
Martin, look at you--

07:02.922 --> 07:05.425
sitting in your chair,
all sour and grumpy.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
You must be drunk
in this picture, Niles.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.195
You got your arm
around a floor lamp.

07:09.195 --> 07:13.029
Oh, no, that's Mar
is in her Easter hat.

07:15.535 --> 07:18.538
Why are you all
hunched over in this one?

07:18.538 --> 07:21.541
You were looking
at my bum, weren't you?

07:21.541 --> 07:22.542
Oh, heavens, no...

07:22.542 --> 07:23.531
It's all right, Niles.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.044
We're married now.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.534
All right, yes.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.015
I might once,
in a moment of weakness,

07:30.516 --> 07:31.881
have permitted myself
a fleeting glance.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.609
Or twice.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.112
Many, many times.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.525
It's all about the rear
with you, isn't it?

07:41.861 --> 07:42.595
Darling, let's not...

07:42.595 --> 07:44.597
Seriously, what color
are my eyes?

07:44.597 --> 07:46.599
You're looking at it
again, aren't you?

07:46.599 --> 07:47.834
No, I...

07:47.834 --> 07:48.926
Boy, you look
at these pictures

07:49.569 --> 07:50.870
and you really see
how far we've all come.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.572
Oh, I'll say.

07:52.572 --> 07:56.576
You were such an old sourpuss,
and you were the Crypt Keeper.

07:56.576 --> 07:57.577
And you, well...

07:57.577 --> 08:01.147
God, you haven'?
changed a bit.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.583
You're even wearing
the same jacket

08:03.583 --> 08:05.084
that you wore
in this picture.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.886
It's hardly the same.
I've had it relined.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.621
I don't mind telling you, Niles,

08:08.621 --> 08:10.656
what happened next was
particularly galling.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.091
I remember exactly
what happened,

08:12.091 --> 08:14.093
and I haven't got a clue
what you're talking about.

08:14.093 --> 08:16.662
Our lives
are so complete.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.497
We really are lucky.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.965
FRASIER:
Oh, please.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.667
That's not
how it happened at all.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.903
Our lives
are so complete.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.929
We really are lucky.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.278
Well, come on, Niles.

08:32.278 --> 08:35.280
We should be heading off
to the baby show.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.283
If we're lucky, we might get
a lead on a nanny.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.284
Oh, well, there are ads in the
back of that Seattle Weekly.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.287
RONEE: Just make sure you look
in the right section.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.756
If she says that she's
got her own toys

08:43.756 --> 08:46.247
and is willing to spank,
she may not be a nanny.

08:46.759 --> 08:47.660
NILES: Don't tell me

08:47.660 --> 08:48.861
in your desperation
over being

08:48.861 --> 08:50.260
the only Crane man
not to find love,

08:50.763 --> 08:52.732
you picked up that paper
and did the unthinkable.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.734
Tawny LaRue, I presume.

08:54.734 --> 08:57.737
FRASIER: I did no such thing, you nit.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.672
And I am telling
this story.

08:59.672 --> 09:02.174
Very slowly.

09:02.174 --> 09:03.903
I'm beginning to think
you didn't do anything.

09:04.176 --> 09:05.711
All right,
I'm getting to it.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.714
As you recall, I promised to
change my neighbor's light bulb.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.204
Oh!

09:10.716 --> 09:12.218
Here we are.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.220
I was just admiring
your bust.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.255
Thank you.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.958
Might look nice
a little higher.

09:18.958 --> 09:22.662
It might look nice
a lot higher,

09:22.662 --> 09:24.664
but heck, I'm 83.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.962
Anyway, I can'
t thank you enough

09:27.667 --> 09:29.669
for coming to my rescue.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.671
Yes, it's lucky you ran into m
in the hall.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.707
Oh, I knew that would be you
coming out of the elevator.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.709
If there's one thing
I can count on,

09:36.709 --> 09:39.211
it's old Frasier's routine,

09:39.211 --> 09:42.214
unchanging
as Granddad's whiskers.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.216
There's old Frasier

09:44.216 --> 09:45.718
off to work.

09:45.718 --> 09:46.719
There's old Frasier
coming home.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.721
There's old Frasier
off to work.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.723
There's old Frasier...

09:50.723 --> 09:52.925
Yes, old Frasier
gets the idea.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.758
That's why I gave you
my spare key.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.785
I knew if there was
ever an emergency,

09:58.297 --> 09:59.298
I could count on you.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.300
Oh...

10:01.300 --> 10:02.802
we should have our tea.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.805
My date's picking me u
p in 20 minutes.

10:05.805 --> 10:09.075
How marvelous.
You're still dating.

10:09.075 --> 10:12.111
Well, I think an active
social life keeps you young.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.671
So, what are you doing
this evening?

10:14.847 --> 10:16.682
I thought I'd stay in
with a good book.

10:16.682 --> 10:20.953
Ah, isn't that nice?

10:20.953 --> 10:23.723
How you're so cozy
in your routine.

10:23.723 --> 10:27.126
You're like
an old shoe, Frasier.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.362
That's when I snapped.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.829
You didn't.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.833
You bludgeoned her
horribly with that bust!

10:33.833 --> 10:36.802
No, you insane twit!

10:36.802 --> 10:38.104
You're like
an old shoe, Frasier.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.106
Now, come have some tea.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.801
FRASIER: I suddenly flashed
on my caller Babette.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.097
Before I knew what I was doing,

10:43.809 --> 10:45.111
I impulsively pocketed

10:45.111 --> 10:46.812
something
that belonged to her.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.115
I stole, Niles.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.816
Like some craven thief.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.785
.
And I've never felt more alive

10:52.785 --> 10:54.252
(thunder crashing)

11:01.227 --> 11:03.729
You can't imagine
the thrill I felt

11:03.729 --> 11:05.665
as I sat there sipping
her inferior tea

11:05.665 --> 11:07.133
and eating her
excellent cookies,

11:07.133 --> 11:10.836
all the while...

11:10.836 --> 11:14.829
fingering the stolen
object in my pocket.

11:16.909 --> 11:20.780
And then, how
coolly I walked out,

11:20.780 --> 11:22.281
scot-free,

11:22.281 --> 11:25.284
the old bird none the wiser.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.420
What's in there?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.922
Some sort of
decorative medallion.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.924
Well, it's pretty clear
what happened.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.415
The depressing series
of events today

11:34.860 --> 11:35.884
Ied you to conclude
that you're in a rut.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.864
Your spontaneous
transgression generated

11:38.864 --> 11:42.368
the excitement that you
so desperately wanted.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.360
Any Caribbean-trained psych
student could tell me that.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.274
Well, if you didn't
want my diagnosis,

11:48.274 --> 11:50.176
why did you call me here?

11:50.176 --> 11:51.844
I am plagued by guilt.

11:51.844 --> 11:53.145
I have to return
this box before

11:53.145 --> 11:54.847
it's discovered missing.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.982
Why did you call me here?

11:56.982 --> 11:57.883
I need your help, Niles.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.884
I have her key.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.374
I know she's out.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.875
We can put this back
and be done with it.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.389
But I don't want to.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.291
I have excitement in my life.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.826
Please!

12:06.826 --> 12:08.127
I can't trust myself
to be alone.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.129
I am caught in the grip
of this mania.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.831
Who knows what
I might steal next?

12:11.831 --> 12:13.499
You took a little box.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.969
I hardly think you're gonna
run off on a crime spree.

12:16.969 --> 12:17.958
Oh, really?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.061
Thief!

12:22.775 --> 12:24.076
That's right.

12:24.076 --> 12:27.068
I took it, and I liked it.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.782
Please. Please, Niles.

12:29.782 --> 12:30.783
I don't want to get involved.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.084
Fine!
I'll do it myself.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.085
Here, hold this for me.
What for?

12:33.085 --> 12:34.787
Now your prints
are on it, too.

12:34.787 --> 12:35.788
You have to help me.

12:35.788 --> 12:36.777
(grunts)

12:38.000 --> 12:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:47.867 --> 12:49.935
Admit it, Niles.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.771
It's intoxicating,
isn't it?

12:51.771 --> 12:55.541
Can't you feel a tingle
running down your spine?

12:55.541 --> 12:57.042
In a minute it's
going to be running

12:57.042 --> 13:00.045
down my inseam.
Hurry up.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.548
I've become a danger junkie.

13:02.548 --> 13:06.051
A cunning cat burglar
with nerves of steel.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.052
(rattling)

13:07.052 --> 13:08.041
(shrieks)

13:08.554 --> 13:11.045
Hide. Hide! Here, here.
Take this box.

13:11.557 --> 13:12.046
No, no, you've
got a pocket.

13:12.558 --> 13:13.547
Put it...

13:15.561 --> 13:16.428
All right, everybody.

13:16.428 --> 13:17.930
Put down your gifts.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.932
Give me your coats and
I'll put them in the bedroom.

13:19.932 --> 13:20.933
(phone rings)

13:20.933 --> 13:21.934
Hello?

13:21.934 --> 13:23.435
Thank you.

13:23.435 --> 13:24.937
Okay, that was the doorman.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.438
Aunt Opal is on her way up.

13:26.438 --> 13:27.928
Everyone find a place to hide.

13:31.443 --> 13:32.933
All right,
quiet, everybody.

13:33.445 --> 13:34.434
I hear them.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.553
ALL:
Surprise!

13:40.553 --> 13:43.044
OPAL:
Oh, my goodness!

13:43.556 --> 13:45.591
Oh, you! Oh!

13:45.591 --> 13:48.082
Frasier?

13:49.595 --> 13:50.527
Who are you?

13:50.996 --> 13:52.998
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane,
the next-door neighbor,

13:52.998 --> 13:54.500
and this is
my brother Niles.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.235
We just want to say
Happy birthday, Opal.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.970
Thank you.

13:57.970 --> 13:58.938
Did someone invite you?

13:58.938 --> 14:00.940
Uh, well, news
of this birthday

14:00.940 --> 14:02.237
has been just buzzing
through the building.

14:02.942 --> 14:03.943
We wouldn't miss an opportunity

14:03.943 --> 14:04.944
to honor this
wonderful lady.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.241
But how'd you get in here?

14:06.946 --> 14:07.947
We slipped in as
the door was closing.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.448
I could swear...

14:09.448 --> 14:11.450
Stop grilling them,
please, Roland.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.452
He thinks he has
to grill everyone

14:13.452 --> 14:16.046
just because
he's a district attorney.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.926
Now, what would
you like to drink?

14:20.926 --> 14:22.294
Champagne.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.964
Well, we really
can't stay.

14:24.964 --> 14:26.298
Oh, you can stay a few minutes.

14:26.298 --> 14:27.967
You don't want
to hurt my feelings.

14:27.967 --> 14:28.968
Let me
take your coat.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.302
Oh, my coat,
no, I'd really

14:30.302 --> 14:31.303
rather you...
Uh... Okay.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.972
Oh, my God.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.039
What? What?!

14:34.039 --> 14:36.075
You're Dr. Frasier Crane.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.077
Here, take this, Roland.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.079
I love your show.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.247
Oh... It's going to be

14:41.247 --> 14:43.916
so exciting to have
a celebrity here

14:43.916 --> 14:46.919
when we take Aunt Opal
picture with her medal.

14:46.919 --> 14:47.953
Medal?

14:47.953 --> 14:49.250
She won the bronze

14:49.955 --> 14:53.459
at the 1936
Berlin Olympics.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.461
So what's it like
being a huge radio star?

14:55.461 --> 14:56.962
Frasier...

14:56.962 --> 14:58.464
Yes, yes,
in a minute, Niles.

14:58.464 --> 15:01.967
Actually, I don't really
think of myself

15:01.967 --> 15:04.970
as a star,
so much as a healer.

15:04.970 --> 15:05.959
The important thing
is to listen.

15:06.472 --> 15:06.961
Frasier.

15:07.473 --> 15:08.474
Not now, Niles.

15:08.474 --> 15:09.975
Frasier, they're
going to take

15:09.975 --> 15:11.477
her picture
with her medal.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.479
Yes, I heard that.

15:13.479 --> 15:14.480
Oh, dear.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.981
Uh, excuse me
just a moment.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.983
You've got to get that
medal out of your coat.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.184
Why don't you get it?

15:19.184 --> 15:20.519
I'm a celebrity.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.521
They're watching
my every move. Go on.

15:22.521 --> 15:25.024
Aunt Opal, tell Dr.
Crane the story

15:25.024 --> 15:28.027
about how you refused
to shake Hitler's hand

15:28.027 --> 15:30.195
when he gave
you that medal.

15:30.195 --> 15:33.790
It looked sweaty,
that's all.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.129
Who are you?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.398
It's just a dream.

16:06.398 --> 16:10.095
Then why aren't
you Harry Truman?

16:12.037 --> 16:13.138
Where's my cake?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.640
I'm ready
for the cake.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.142
No, not until we take
the family picture, Mother.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.042
I got it.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.279
Then let's take
the darned picture.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.268
Roland, get my medal down.

16:21.780 --> 16:22.269
Where is it?

16:22.781 --> 16:24.078
Same place it
always is,

16:24.350 --> 16:28.287
unless it's grown legs
like a tadpole and hopped away.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.222
We have got to get
that medal up there.

16:30.222 --> 16:31.211
We?
You're right.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.225
Bad plan. You've got
to get it up there.

16:33.225 --> 16:35.127
All right, top shelf,
right of the sconce.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.763
You know, before
we take the picture,

16:37.763 --> 16:40.766
I have a little story
I'd like to tell

16:40.766 --> 16:43.769
that just may rival
that Hitler tale.

16:43.769 --> 16:44.770
(laughing)

16:44.770 --> 16:49.274
The place...
was right here.

16:49.274 --> 16:53.142
The time was
this afternoon.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.080
Opal had just set out

16:55.080 --> 16:59.084
a lovely service of tea
and a plate of sweets.

16:59.084 --> 17:04.790
I remember there were three
cookies sitting on the plate

17:04.790 --> 17:07.884
and I reached
for the left one.

17:08.292 --> 17:12.196
Not the center one,

17:12.196 --> 17:14.188
the left one, and...

17:15.701 --> 17:18.203
Just at
the same moment,

17:18.203 --> 17:20.204
Opal reached for
the very same cookie.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.195
Oh, what did you
say, Opal?

17:22.708 --> 17:23.709
It was priceless.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.712
I said: "you take it"

17:26.712 --> 17:28.202
Right off the
top of her head.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.373
What are you doing?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.654
I can tell from the panic
in my brother's voice

17:35.654 --> 17:37.656
that he, he must
have seen a spider.

17:37.656 --> 17:39.658
You see, he has a,
a crippling fear

17:39.658 --> 17:42.161
of spiders and it
sent him up the ladder.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.530
Yes. I hate spiders.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.394
I don't see a spider.

17:46.065 --> 17:46.732
Come back down.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.133
No!
Why not?

17:48.133 --> 17:50.636
Because he also has
a crippling fear of heights

17:50.636 --> 17:52.137
and this may be
just the breakthrough

17:52.137 --> 17:53.627
we've been looking for.
Higher, Niles.

17:54.139 --> 17:55.140
Conquer your fear.

17:55.140 --> 17:58.343
Please, everyone,

17:58.343 --> 18:01.180
I'm going to have
to ask you to turn around,

18:01.180 --> 18:03.515
as his fear
of crowds has set in.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.107
Crowds, too?

18:05.484 --> 18:06.473
Yes. You are looking
at that rarest of beasts--

18:07.119 --> 18:07.786
the arachno-acro-agoraphobe.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.219
Please, avert your eyes.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.744
Oh. Oh.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.459
This is the most
difficult part of the process.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.256
I am using a
technique known

18:15.828 --> 18:17.329
as behavioral
exposure therapy.

18:17.329 --> 18:19.331
Climb higher, Niles.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.332
Ever higher.

18:20.332 --> 18:21.133
Conquer your fear.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.668
Wow. Frasier
Crane in action.

18:22.668 --> 18:23.669
No, please.

18:23.669 --> 18:25.170
No peeking.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.660
You don't want
to cause a setback.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.110
Everybody freeze!

18:31.110 --> 18:33.101
This is the moment
of truth.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.170
I haven't done this
since my days in med school.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.690
Hurrah!

18:44.690 --> 18:46.692
He's done it!

18:46.692 --> 18:48.182
He's conquered all three!

18:50.395 --> 18:53.265
What are you doing?

18:53.265 --> 18:54.266
Well, you as an athlete

18:54.266 --> 18:55.756
should know the...
the time-honored tradition

18:56.268 --> 18:57.758
of hoisting the victor
on one's shoulders.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.139
They never did that to me.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.208
Well, you finished third,
didn't you?

19:03.208 --> 19:05.577
Now, if
you'll excuse me,

19:05.577 --> 19:08.580
I've got to journal all this
while it's still fresh.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.583
Good night, everyone.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.584
Oh.

19:12.584 --> 19:15.220
Good Lord, I
should have dipped.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.221
Yes, there we go.

19:16.221 --> 19:17.210
Ooh!

19:17.589 --> 19:19.284
So sorry.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.501
Oh, hey, Dad.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.170
I didn't know
you guys were here.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.159
Where's Ronee?

19:32.504 --> 19:33.994
Oh, she's in bed waiting for me.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.509
Hey, know what?

19:37.509 --> 19:39.011
She can't see a thing
without her contacts.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.445
Why don't we play
a little joke on her?

19:40.445 --> 19:42.936
You tiptoe in...
No, Dad, I'll pass.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.519
Still looking at those
old pictures, huh?

19:47.519 --> 19:48.854
Yeah.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.378
It's funny, isn't it?

19:50.656 --> 19:51.645
What?

19:52.291 --> 19:54.293
How suddenly
your whole life can change.

19:54.293 --> 19:57.696
I never would have dreamed
back then that I'd end up

19:57.696 --> 19:59.665
getting married again,
at my age,

19:59.665 --> 20:03.302
and to someone
so young and full of pep.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.470
I'm very happy
for you and Ronee.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.273
That's the way it is.

20:08.273 --> 20:10.309
Just when you think
that you're in a rut

20:10.309 --> 20:13.312
and nothing exciting will ever
happen to you again...

20:13.312 --> 20:16.014
Pow. That's when it does.

20:16.014 --> 20:18.450
Maybe you're right.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.350
I know I'm right.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.289
Good night, Fras.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.280
Good night, Dad.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.286
You know, you could put on
my robe and a little bit

20:32.664 --> 20:34.655
of my Aqua Velva.
Good night, Dad.
