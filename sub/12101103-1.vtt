01:45.851 --> 01:47.686
<i>The Psalmist's call</i>

01:47.719 --> 01:50.256
<i>to hear the Lord's voice</i>

01:50.289 --> 01:54.693
<i>has particular
significance for us</i>

01:54.726 --> 01:57.729
<i>as we celebrate
this mass in Baltimore.</i>

02:00.433 --> 02:06.205
<i>Maryland was the birthplace
of the church</i>

02:06.239 --> 02:08.174
<i>in colonial America.</i>

02:10.408 --> 02:14.313
<i>more than 360 years ago.</i>

02:16.349 --> 02:18.251
It chose today of all days.

02:19.951 --> 02:22.088
The Holy Father
a mere stone's throw away.

02:24.257 --> 02:26.025
I suspect that's no coincidence.

02:32.131 --> 02:34.433
I fear this one will be
different than the others.

02:36.169 --> 02:37.403
This one seems to have.

02:39.272 --> 02:40.339
purpose.

03:01.260 --> 03:03.229
Soon, Peter.

03:03.262 --> 03:04.230
I promise.

03:05.431 --> 03:07.166
I have complete faith in you.

03:11.404 --> 03:13.105
A prayer before we begin.

03:19.078 --> 03:20.446
Our Father, who art in heaven,

03:22.048 --> 03:24.183
hallowed be thy name.

03:24.217 --> 03:26.519
May your kingdom come.

03:26.552 --> 03:30.456
May your will be done,
as in Heaven, so on earth.

03:33.725 --> 03:38.164
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

03:38.197 --> 03:42.001
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

03:42.034 --> 03:45.770
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

03:51.177 --> 03:56.082
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

03:58.084 --> 04:01.354
<i>Father Louis,
please come quick!</i>

04:01.387 --> 04:02.521
Amen.

04:10.895 --> 04:12.565
See the cross of the Lord;

04:12.598 --> 04:15.201
begone, hostile powers!

04:15.234 --> 04:16.935
Peter!

04:16.968 --> 04:18.170
The response!

04:18.204 --> 04:19.838
Focus!

04:19.870 --> 04:21.140
The stem of David,

04:21.173 --> 04:22.874
the lion of Judah's tribe
has conquered.

04:22.907 --> 04:24.510
Lord, hear my prayer.

04:24.543 --> 04:26.279
And let my cry be heard by you.

04:26.312 --> 04:27.513
The Lord be with you.

04:27.546 --> 04:28.813
May He also be with you.

04:35.021 --> 04:37.456
I cast you out, unclean spirit,

04:37.490 --> 04:40.226
along with
all your fell companions;

04:40.259 --> 04:43.462
in the name of Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Begone.

04:49.335 --> 04:51.270
Nicky?

04:51.304 --> 04:53.072
- Nicky.
- What's happening?

04:53.105 --> 04:54.573
- Nicky, wake up.
- He's not moving.

04:54.607 --> 04:56.509
- Wake up, Nicky!
- What have you done?

04:56.542 --> 04:57.510
I'm talking to you, look at me!

04:57.543 --> 04:58.910
Wake up!

04:58.943 --> 04:59.844
What have you done to my son?

04:59.878 --> 05:01.846
You suffocated my son.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.349
Nicholas, wake up.

05:03.382 --> 05:04.517
Is this your answer?

05:04.550 --> 05:05.917
Is this your answer?

05:14.226 --> 05:15.294
Father.

05:17.530 --> 05:20.166
I need to confess my sins.

05:20.199 --> 05:21.400
I know you're dying to hear

05:21.434 --> 05:23.369
all the naughty things
I've done.

05:25.037 --> 05:27.872
Your efforts
are wasted on me, you devil.

05:27.906 --> 05:32.478
Hearken, therefore,
and tremble in fear, Satan, you.

05:32.511 --> 05:35.348
you enemy of the faith,
you foe of the human race!

05:35.381 --> 05:37.616
And what about you,
little sheep?

05:37.650 --> 05:40.353
You look lost,
you poor dumb animal.

05:40.386 --> 05:44.223
You corrupter of justice,
root of all evil and vice!

05:44.256 --> 05:46.392
Scared. Alone.

05:46.425 --> 05:49.061
Separated from your flock.

05:49.095 --> 05:53.165
You should find yourself
a new shepherd, little sheep.

05:53.199 --> 05:58.003
Crucified as man, but triumphed
over the powers of hell!

05:58.037 --> 05:59.338
Don't be afraid!

05:59.372 --> 06:01.073
Rejoice in the power!

06:01.107 --> 06:02.675
In the possibilities!

06:02.708 --> 06:05.611
Smile like
you've never smiled before!

06:16.088 --> 06:17.356
Nicky!

06:19.158 --> 06:20.426
Nicky!

06:26.165 --> 06:28.467
One of you, make him stop.

06:34.106 --> 06:35.174
What's happening?

06:37.343 --> 06:38.310
Get it off her.

06:38.344 --> 06:39.512
Now, quick!

06:41.147 --> 06:42.214
Listen to him, Sarah!
Take it off!

06:44.550 --> 06:45.451
I can't get it!
It's too tight.

06:45.484 --> 06:47.952
It's pulling into my skin.
Take it off!

06:50.689 --> 06:53.459
I command you,
unclean spirit,

06:53.492 --> 06:57.029
along with all your minions
attacking this servant of God,

06:57.062 --> 06:59.031
by the mysteries
of the incarnation,

06:59.064 --> 07:00.399
the passion, resurrection,

07:00.433 --> 07:02.368
and ascension
of our Lord Jesus Christ!

07:02.401 --> 07:04.537
By the descent
of the Holy Spirit!

07:04.570 --> 07:06.572
By the coming
of our Lord for judgment,

07:06.605 --> 07:10.543
you tell me
by some sign your name,

07:10.576 --> 07:14.380
and the day and hour
of your departure!

07:14.413 --> 07:16.482
I command you!

07:16.515 --> 07:18.150
No!

07:19.618 --> 07:22.221
Father Louis, Father Louis.

07:27.493 --> 07:28.694
No, no, no, no.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.466
Please, you have to stay!
I'm not ready.

07:33.499 --> 07:35.167
Please say he's okay.

07:35.201 --> 07:37.136
Please stay with me.

07:37.169 --> 07:38.404
Father Peter.

07:38.437 --> 07:39.505
Please stop.

07:39.538 --> 07:41.006
Please stop.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.175
Please stop.

07:43.209 --> 07:44.410
Please stop it.

07:46.712 --> 07:49.748
No. No.

07:49.782 --> 07:51.550
- God help us.
- Father Peter.

07:51.584 --> 07:52.618
Oh my God.

07:52.651 --> 07:53.686
What is happening to him?

07:53.719 --> 07:54.887
His skin is burning!

07:54.920 --> 07:57.656
- My son's skin is burning.
- Father Peter, please!

07:57.690 --> 08:00.259
It's spreading.
You have to help him.

08:00.292 --> 08:01.427
Father Peter, please.

08:01.460 --> 08:02.328
Do something.

08:02.361 --> 08:04.497
Sarah, just wait. I'm trying.

08:04.530 --> 08:06.799
Michael,
we can't just stand here.

08:06.832 --> 08:08.400
- Father Peter!
- Call someone!

08:08.434 --> 08:09.802
- Look at me!
- Do something.

08:09.835 --> 08:11.737
Can you help him?

08:19.612 --> 08:20.813
<i>Still awaiting a trial date</i>

08:20.846 --> 08:23.415
<i>for Charlie Giroux,
the 12-year-old</i>

08:23.449 --> 08:26.318
<i>who shocked an entire city
when just two nights ago,</i>

08:26.352 --> 08:28.687
<i>he went on a killing spree,
brutally murdering</i>

08:28.721 --> 08:31.557
<i>his mother, father,
and 16-year-old sister.</i>

08:31.590 --> 08:33.158
You can go in now.

08:33.192 --> 08:34.193
Oh.

08:35.294 --> 08:36.595
Thank you.

08:41.232 --> 08:43.568
Father Daniel,
I've kept you waiting.

08:43.602 --> 08:44.570
Forgive me.

08:44.603 --> 08:45.838
Join us, please.

08:45.871 --> 08:47.473
Thank you.

08:49.341 --> 08:50.609
Father Daniel GarcÃ­a,

08:50.643 --> 08:53.479
I would like you to meet
Father Peter Costello.

08:53.512 --> 08:56.348
His Excellency
has spoken so highly of you.

08:56.382 --> 08:57.516
It's an honor.

08:57.550 --> 08:59.652
They're sending them
straight from the seminary now?

08:59.685 --> 09:00.753
Perhaps he looks young

09:00.786 --> 09:02.454
because you're getting old.

09:02.488 --> 09:04.490
Please, sit.

09:04.523 --> 09:06.825
I've been saying to Father Peter
that you've just returned

09:06.859 --> 09:10.663
from your training
at our new academy in Chicago

09:10.696 --> 09:13.098
and my sources tell me
that you are.

09:13.132 --> 09:16.435
well, you are exemplary.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.138
Father Daniel
comes highly recommended

09:19.171 --> 09:21.807
as our newest
and finest recruit.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.576
How long was it?

09:23.609 --> 09:25.377
The program.
How long was it?

09:25.411 --> 09:28.614
Peter, don't start.

09:28.647 --> 09:31.550
I don't make these decisions,
you know that.

09:31.584 --> 09:32.718
Is something wrong?

09:32.751 --> 09:35.287
No, nothing
you need concern yourself with.

09:35.321 --> 09:36.522
Father Peter
has a difficult time

09:36.555 --> 09:38.324
accepting the sobering

09:38.357 --> 09:40.826
and unfortunate reality
that desperate times

09:40.859 --> 09:43.662
do indeed require
desperate measures.

09:43.696 --> 09:45.531
Has it been getting worse?

09:45.564 --> 09:46.899
Despite our very best efforts,

09:46.932 --> 09:48.467
there has been
a precipitous rise

09:48.500 --> 09:51.136
in the number of reported
demonic possessions

09:51.170 --> 09:53.205
throughout the nation,

09:53.238 --> 09:55.507
but we're not giving up
the fight, are we?

09:55.541 --> 09:59.478
No, no, we're hopeful.
no, no, we're confident

09:59.511 --> 10:01.714
that once we've unleashed
the next wave of recruits.

10:01.747 --> 10:03.182
Well, let's unleash, shall we?

10:04.750 --> 10:06.518
Sorry. I thought
that was my cue.

10:06.552 --> 10:07.786
No, that's all right, Peter.

10:07.820 --> 10:08.754
Matter of fact,
I think we've said

10:08.787 --> 10:11.523
all that needs to be said,
for the moment.

10:11.557 --> 10:12.791
Good.

10:12.825 --> 10:15.127
Will you run down the street,
get me a coffee?

10:17.196 --> 10:18.564
Your Excellency,
always a pleasure

10:18.597 --> 10:19.798
doing business with you.

10:19.832 --> 10:21.233
Peter.

10:29.475 --> 10:30.776
I guess.

10:33.712 --> 10:35.848
Father Daniel.

10:35.881 --> 10:37.650
A moment, please.

10:40.586 --> 10:43.355
I know that you've
had to absorb

10:43.389 --> 10:46.191
a great deal
in a very short time.

10:47.826 --> 10:51.630
However, there are.
things I think

10:51.664 --> 10:53.832
that they did not teach you
at the academy,

10:53.866 --> 10:56.535
things that you should know.

10:56.568 --> 11:01.774
For some years prior to
our current situation,

11:01.807 --> 11:05.277
the Vatican adopted,
a. shall we say,

11:05.310 --> 11:09.581
negative attitude toward
the practice of exorcism.

11:09.615 --> 11:11.750
There were a number
of controversial cases

11:11.784 --> 11:15.421
that unfortunately
were made public.

11:15.454 --> 11:17.256
The situation was not
merely embarrassing.

11:17.289 --> 11:19.291
It was untenable;
something had to be done.

11:19.324 --> 11:23.962
So the Church
simply walked away from it.

11:23.996 --> 11:28.867
Simply stopped teaching
the rites of exorcism.

11:28.901 --> 11:34.606
However, it was a handful
of brave and dedicated priests,

11:34.640 --> 11:38.343
no more than a dozen or so,
who continued to train,

11:38.377 --> 11:41.947
and to. to study and.
and to practice in private,

11:41.980 --> 11:43.916
underground,
despite the admonition

11:43.949 --> 11:45.818
of the Church leadership.

11:45.851 --> 11:50.289
Now, the most revered
of these priests

11:50.322 --> 11:51.490
was Father Louis.

11:51.523 --> 11:58.297
He was a man of deep, deep faith
and true personal courage.

11:58.330 --> 12:01.500
Louis was Father Peter's mentor.

12:01.533 --> 12:06.705
And on that very dark day,
when Louis lost his life

12:06.739 --> 12:12.911
to a malignant
and very powerful evil,

12:12.945 --> 12:14.947
it was Father Peter

12:14.980 --> 12:17.816
who stepped in
to take his place.

12:17.850 --> 12:24.323
Now, I know that he is
sometimes. unconventional,

12:24.356 --> 12:29.394
put it that way,
but. you need to know

12:29.428 --> 12:32.264
that Father Peter trained
with the very best.

12:33.866 --> 12:37.469
And I feel in my heart

12:37.503 --> 12:39.838
that I'm putting you
into good hands.

12:51.251 --> 12:56.855
âª Mm mm mm
Turn around turn around âª

12:56.889 --> 13:00.592
âª Waoo waoo yeah! âª

13:02.995 --> 13:04.363
Did I do something wrong?

13:06.398 --> 13:08.000
âª Wooo. âª

13:08.034 --> 13:10.069
Did you not hear
the Archbishop?

13:10.103 --> 13:11.737
I was one of the best
in my class.

13:11.770 --> 13:13.438
Oh yeah, that's right!

13:13.472 --> 13:15.607
Two grueling weeks
of exorcist nursery school.

13:17.776 --> 13:19.344
Did you get a gold star
for that?

13:19.378 --> 13:20.846
It actually was
pretty grueling.

13:20.879 --> 13:22.714
Ah!

13:22.748 --> 13:24.850
If you want, I can prove it.
Just ask me anything.

13:24.883 --> 13:26.518
- Anything?
- Yes.

13:28.687 --> 13:30.023
What the fuck
are you doing in my car?

13:30.056 --> 13:31.090
What?

13:31.124 --> 13:31.957
Why are you here?

13:31.990 --> 13:33.892
Like, why did you
volunteer for this?

13:33.926 --> 13:35.427
You said ask you anything.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.396
I meant anything
about exorcisms.

13:37.429 --> 13:38.597
And why you want to be
an exorcist

13:38.630 --> 13:40.399
is not relevant
to that discussion?

13:40.432 --> 13:41.700
You caught me off guard.

13:41.733 --> 13:42.868
It's not a trick question.

13:42.901 --> 13:46.705
I know, but.
you're making me a bit nervous.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.107
Nervous, ah?

13:48.141 --> 13:49.408
You realize what
we're going to be dealing with

13:49.441 --> 13:50.442
out there today, right?

13:50.475 --> 13:51.977
Well then, not nervous.
Anxious.

13:52.011 --> 13:53.846
Oh, okay.
Well, that changes everything.

13:53.879 --> 13:56.381
I mean, everyone knows
what anxiety is like for demons.

13:56.415 --> 13:57.549
You know,
it's like kryptonite,

13:57.583 --> 13:59.052
they're utterly
defenseless against it.

14:13.565 --> 14:15.034
What did the Archbishop
tell you about me?

14:18.204 --> 14:20.006
That you've been traveling
all around the country,

14:20.039 --> 14:22.474
and you're the best
exorcist there is,

14:22.507 --> 14:24.077
that you've been
training recruits and.

14:27.713 --> 14:28.914
he told me about your mentor.

14:30.716 --> 14:31.884
Father Louis.

14:36.055 --> 14:39.524
What he didn't tell you,
I imagine,

14:39.558 --> 14:41.860
was that after
Father Louis died,

14:41.894 --> 14:44.830
the ten-year-old boy,
Nicholas Miller,

14:44.863 --> 14:49.835
who I was left alone
to try and save, he also died.

14:49.868 --> 14:51.436
You know how?

14:51.470 --> 14:53.839
He erupted into fucking flames.

14:53.872 --> 14:56.842
He burned to death on his bed
right in front of me,

14:56.875 --> 14:58.644
in front of his parents.

14:58.677 --> 15:00.113
There was nothing
I could do to help.

15:00.146 --> 15:01.513
I failed him.

15:03.149 --> 15:07.786
So.
that's why I'm here.

15:07.819 --> 15:08.954
Okay. Not for some
greater good.

15:08.987 --> 15:10.923
Not to save the world.

15:10.956 --> 15:13.792
But because
I have a score to settle.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.962
And until I do,
the memory of that boy's face.

15:22.035 --> 15:23.468
in those flames.

15:24.670 --> 15:25.837
will continue to haunt me
every day

15:25.871 --> 15:27.173
for the rest of my life.

15:29.708 --> 15:34.646
So. Father Daniel,
I ask you, one last time.

15:38.251 --> 15:39.584
why are you here?

16:02.641 --> 16:03.709
Come on, get out.

16:07.646 --> 16:09.148
That's it?

16:09.182 --> 16:11.583
You need to
change those clothes.

16:11.616 --> 16:12.751
What's wrong with my clothes?

16:13.986 --> 16:15.487
You look like a priest.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.728
<i>Whether you continue
on as an exorcist</i>

16:22.761 --> 16:24.663
<i>or go back to writing sermons
for Sunday mass</i>

16:24.696 --> 16:26.299
<i>is up to me now,
Father Daniel.</i>

16:26.332 --> 16:27.799
<i>I'm giving you one day
to convince me</i>

16:27.833 --> 16:29.768
<i>you're worth my time, okay?</i>

16:29.801 --> 16:31.304
<i>And since you can't tell me
why you're here,</i>

16:31.337 --> 16:33.538
<i>you're gonna have to
show me instead.</i>

16:33.572 --> 16:35.274
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

16:35.308 --> 16:37.876
<i>Walk up to all these people
and ask if they're possessed?</i>

16:37.909 --> 16:38.910
Well, riddle me this,

16:38.944 --> 16:40.612
Mister top recruit
in his class.

16:42.781 --> 16:44.050
How are you going to
exorcise a demon

16:44.083 --> 16:45.218
if you can't even find it?

16:46.852 --> 16:48.087
Gentlemen!

16:48.121 --> 16:50.722
Can I help you with something?

16:50.756 --> 16:52.091
Oh, we're just looking
for an old friend.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.658
Well, you're in luck!

16:53.692 --> 16:55.594
I know everyone there is
to know in these parts,

16:55.627 --> 16:56.762
and they know me.

16:56.795 --> 16:58.031
Who's your friend?

16:58.064 --> 16:59.598
What was
that name again, Daniel?

17:02.801 --> 17:03.835
It's, uh.

17:05.871 --> 17:06.838
we know where to look.

17:39.305 --> 17:40.672
Final answer?

18:12.171 --> 18:14.173
Excuse me?

18:14.207 --> 18:16.242
I'm sorry to bother you.

18:16.275 --> 18:17.376
My name is Daniel.

18:18.877 --> 18:20.346
Where is Ma?

18:20.379 --> 18:21.380
Who?

18:22.814 --> 18:24.383
Helen.

18:24.417 --> 18:26.952
She usually brings my food.

18:26.985 --> 18:28.387
Oh, I-I'm not with
the volunteers.

18:30.789 --> 18:33.025
I actually just wanted to
ask you a few questions,

18:33.059 --> 18:34.327
if that's okay?

18:39.031 --> 18:40.832
I think I'm done
talking to you, Daniel.

18:40.866 --> 18:41.900
Hey no, no, no.
Just stay with me.

18:41.933 --> 18:45.704
Hey! I'm only gonna
tell you this one more time!

18:45.737 --> 18:47.306
If you know what's good for you,

18:47.340 --> 18:49.774
you and your creepy-ass friend
over there

18:49.808 --> 18:52.011
better get on up outta here!

18:52.044 --> 18:53.379
Now!

18:55.847 --> 18:58.217
Yo, are you deaf?

18:58.251 --> 19:00.052
It's-it's totally your call.

19:00.086 --> 19:01.287
This is my house.

19:03.489 --> 19:04.490
But I don't have my tools.

19:04.524 --> 19:05.424
I told y'all
about coming 'round here.

19:10.363 --> 19:11.564
What the fuck, man!

19:11.597 --> 19:14.200
In the name of
Jesus Christ, our God and Lord,

19:14.233 --> 19:17.203
strengthened by the intercession
of the Immaculate Virgin Mary,

19:17.236 --> 19:18.937
- Mother of God.
- Louder!

19:18.970 --> 19:20.006
No, no, no, no, no.

19:20.039 --> 19:22.008
Of the blessed
Michael the Archangel

19:22.041 --> 19:23.708
and the blessed Apostles
Peter and Paul.

19:23.742 --> 19:25.111
Excuse me.

19:25.144 --> 19:26.912
What's goin' on here?

19:26.945 --> 19:28.947
George?
Are you all right?

19:28.980 --> 19:31.017
Yo, Ma, I-I thought
they was those creeps

19:31.050 --> 19:32.285
from the mental hospital again.

19:32.318 --> 19:35.354
No, and I think you might wanna
call the cops or something.

19:35.388 --> 19:37.256
Gentlemen, I think
it's time for you to leave.

19:37.290 --> 19:39.758
Read this.

19:39.791 --> 19:41.860
I said leave,
or I'm gonna call the cops.

19:41.893 --> 19:43.095
Read it.

19:43.129 --> 19:44.763
Obizuth?

21:12.385 --> 21:15.854
You dare
to speak my name, priest?

21:15.887 --> 21:16.921
The power of Christ compels.

21:16.955 --> 21:18.090
- .you.
- Shhh.

21:21.594 --> 21:23.029
I haven't tasted

21:23.062 --> 21:26.132
such succulent lamb
in a long time.

21:46.118 --> 21:47.986
Obizuth, fallen angel,

21:48.020 --> 21:50.389
in the name and by the power
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

21:50.423 --> 21:51.856
may you be snatched away

21:51.890 --> 21:53.958
and driven from
the Church of God

21:53.992 --> 21:56.995
and from the souls made to
the image and likeness of God

21:57.029 --> 21:59.898
and be redeemed by the precious
blood of the divine lamb.

21:59.931 --> 22:02.000
He with whom,
in your great insolence,

22:02.034 --> 22:03.968
you still claim to be equal.

22:04.003 --> 22:05.937
God who wants
all men to be saved

22:05.970 --> 22:07.573
and to come to the knowledge
of the truth.

22:07.606 --> 22:09.175
God the Father commands you!

22:09.208 --> 22:10.443
God the Son commands you!

22:10.476 --> 22:12.278
God the Holy Ghost commands you!

22:12.311 --> 22:14.380
The sacred sign
of the cross commands you!

22:14.413 --> 22:17.049
The faith of the holy apostles,
Peter and Paul,

22:17.083 --> 22:19.085
and of the other apostles
commands you!

22:19.118 --> 22:20.319
The blood of the martyrs

22:20.353 --> 22:22.954
and the pious intercession
of all the saints commands you!

22:22.987 --> 22:24.190
Be gone!

22:41.273 --> 22:42.308
It's okay, Helen.

22:42.341 --> 22:43.509
It's okay.

22:43.542 --> 22:45.411
You're okay.

22:45.444 --> 22:47.480
It's all right.

23:13.139 --> 23:14.939
You knew it was her.

23:15.974 --> 23:18.511
How?

23:18.544 --> 23:20.579
I mean, she gives
food to the homeless!

23:20.613 --> 23:22.515
She's a nice old lady,
there wasn't anything

23:22.548 --> 23:23.516
- bad about it.
- Look.

23:23.549 --> 23:28.220
this academy in Chicago,
even the one in Rome.

23:30.656 --> 23:33.058
anyone who tells you they can
teach you this in dark rooms,

23:33.092 --> 23:34.360
with books
and slides and lectures,

23:34.393 --> 23:37.196
they're full of shit. Okay?

23:37.229 --> 23:39.064
They can give you
a crucifix and holy water,

23:39.098 --> 23:40.733
they can teach you the prayers,
but that's not what separates us

23:40.766 --> 23:44.036
from your average
garden variety Sunday priests.

23:44.069 --> 23:47.339
You need to be willing
to put yourself at risk. Okay?

23:47.373 --> 23:50.142
You need to have
the strength, the faith,

23:50.176 --> 23:52.044
the purity of heart
to allow yourself

23:52.077 --> 23:56.649
to go to places
so dark, so terrifying,

23:56.682 --> 23:58.083
the thought of it would
make those other priests

23:58.117 --> 23:59.418
all piss in their vestments.

24:02.788 --> 24:07.359
An exorcist doesn't hide
from evil, he runs toward it.

24:07.393 --> 24:10.229
He immerses himself in it,
so that he learns

24:10.262 --> 24:13.699
to sense it in his bones
and feel it when it's close,

24:13.732 --> 24:15.167
because he knows
he needs to understand it

24:15.201 --> 24:16.735
in order
to be able to defeat it,

24:16.769 --> 24:19.004
to-to snuff it out
before it's dug in.

24:20.105 --> 24:22.441
Evil is clever.

24:22.475 --> 24:24.176
Demons are unpredictable.

24:24.210 --> 24:28.547
They don't. they don't
scream their presence.

24:28.581 --> 24:31.484
They hide in places
that we least expect them to,

24:31.517 --> 24:33.352
so they can multiply,
so they can grow

24:33.385 --> 24:37.523
more and more powerful,
right under our noses.

24:37.556 --> 24:39.425
Until it's too late.

24:39.458 --> 24:40.526
Of course I knew it was Helen,

24:40.559 --> 24:42.161
I've been doing this
for 25 years.

24:43.662 --> 24:46.298
Okay, now if you're ready to
follow me and listen and learn,

24:46.332 --> 24:47.266
- and do what I tell...
- I'm ready.

24:52.605 --> 24:53.539
Okay.

24:56.642 --> 24:57.743
All right.
Well, let's do this.

25:37.216 --> 25:39.351
I saw this
on the news this morning.

25:39.385 --> 25:41.287
This is the house where
the boy murdered his family.

25:42.688 --> 25:43.556
So what are you waiting for?

25:45.424 --> 25:46.725
We're going in there?

25:46.759 --> 25:49.261
No, you're going in there.

25:49.295 --> 25:50.396
You said you were ready.

25:58.170 --> 25:59.104
Is it even legal?

26:01.240 --> 26:04.109
You're about to enter a house
harboring inexplicable evil,

26:04.143 --> 26:06.412
and you're worried about
a trespassing citation?

26:08.914 --> 26:10.482
And what do I even do
when I'm in there?

26:10.516 --> 26:12.351
Open yourself up.

26:12.384 --> 26:13.319
Let it in.

26:17.790 --> 26:19.692
You're serious?

26:19.725 --> 26:20.526
Have you listened to anything

26:20.559 --> 26:22.428
- I've said to you today?
- Yes, yes!

26:22.461 --> 26:23.862
I-I'm just nervous.

26:23.896 --> 26:25.631
Trust in your faith, Daniel.

26:25.664 --> 26:27.700
Okay? If you do that,
it can't hurt you.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.708
I'm going in.

26:35.741 --> 26:36.675
Yeah.

26:40.746 --> 26:41.780
I can't have that.

26:41.814 --> 26:44.149
Just don't drop it
this time, okay?

26:44.183 --> 26:45.818
You never know, one day
it might come in handy.

27:48.747 --> 27:49.715
Let it in.

27:59.291 --> 28:00.993
<i>Tell me where you were.</i>

28:01.027 --> 28:02.795
<i>Don't you dare lie to me,
Charlie Giroux.</i>

28:02.828 --> 28:03.962
<i>I swear to God.</i>

28:03.996 --> 28:05.230
<i>I was at school. I swear.</i>

28:05.264 --> 28:06.699
<i>He's totally lying.</i>

28:06.732 --> 28:08.734
I saw one of his faggot friends
posted on his story.

28:08.767 --> 28:09.768
Shut up, Nellie!

28:09.802 --> 28:11.336
Make me, Sally.

28:11.370 --> 28:12.404
What did I tell you
about hanging around

28:12.438 --> 28:13.972
with those children?

28:14.007 --> 28:15.774
What did I say?

28:15.808 --> 28:17.810
It was Carson's birthday!

28:17.843 --> 28:19.244
For the last time,

28:19.278 --> 28:21.380
you are going to
make friends here,

28:21.413 --> 28:24.283
at your own school,
in your own neighborhood.

28:24.316 --> 28:26.285
I don't want new friends!

28:26.318 --> 28:28.821
A boy your age
should be playing sports.

28:28.854 --> 28:30.289
I'm signing you up for football.

28:30.322 --> 28:32.257
I don't want to
play football!

28:32.291 --> 28:34.660
They're filthy,
disgusting children

28:34.693 --> 28:35.728
from a filthy,
disgusting city

28:35.761 --> 28:39.431
and I will not have my children
associating with.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.473
<i>That's okay.</i>

28:47.506 --> 28:49.308
<i>She asked me
to come see you today.</i>

28:52.078 --> 28:53.912
<i>To have a little
one-on-one time,</i>

28:53.946 --> 28:55.280
<i>just me and you.</i>

28:56.782 --> 28:57.950
<i>Do you know why?</i>

29:00.486 --> 29:03.622
<i>She mentioned you might be
getting in with the wrong crowd,</i>

29:03.655 --> 29:06.391
<i>and she's concerned
for your safety.</i>

29:08.894 --> 29:10.896
She cares about you, Charlie.

29:10.929 --> 29:12.831
So much.

29:12.865 --> 29:14.266
And I care about you too.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.936
You're a very special boy.

29:19.471 --> 29:20.372
Do you know that?

29:21.940 --> 29:24.409
Do you know how special
you are to me?

29:59.645 --> 30:03.982
<i>No! No, no, no!</i>

30:04.017 --> 30:05.350
<i>Charlie, no!</i>

31:12.185 --> 31:15.520
<i>Please help me!</i>

31:19.725 --> 31:23.729
<i>Help me.</i>

32:00.899 --> 32:02.901
Father Daniel.

32:06.705 --> 32:07.739
Help me.

32:47.213 --> 32:49.182
We need to go see the boy.

32:50.482 --> 32:52.617
<i>We all know
children are the most vulnerable</i>

32:52.651 --> 32:54.619
<i>of the population
when it comes to possession.</i>

32:55.988 --> 32:57.223
<i>That will help us
when presenting Charlie's case</i>

32:57.256 --> 32:58.124
<i>to the Archbishop,</i>

32:58.157 --> 32:59.725
<i>but we're still
going to need proof.</i>

33:00.993 --> 33:02.761
<i>We'll need to trace it
back to the source.</i>

33:13.339 --> 33:15.141
Are you sure
the Archbishop can do this?

33:16.742 --> 33:19.012
When you work for a titan
of influence and corruption,

33:19.045 --> 33:20.912
this is one of the perks.
You should get used to it.

33:26.119 --> 33:29.322
All right, okay.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.655
Okay.

33:45.937 --> 33:46.938
This is all you.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.346
You're the one who formed
the connection at the house.

33:53.379 --> 33:54.679
Yeah?

33:54.713 --> 33:56.615
This is your case now.

33:56.648 --> 33:57.749
You gotta see it through.

33:59.318 --> 34:00.219
Are you coming or not?

34:06.192 --> 34:07.093
I'll be right out here.

34:30.283 --> 34:31.350
You've got five minutes.

34:46.232 --> 34:49.734
Charlie,
my name is Father Daniel.

34:49.768 --> 34:50.802
I know you.

34:55.274 --> 34:56.208
From my dream.

35:00.446 --> 35:01.713
Well, that's good.

35:04.749 --> 35:06.252
It means we're not strangers.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.254
Right?

35:09.688 --> 35:11.756
You can talk to me.

35:11.790 --> 35:12.991
It wasn't me.

35:13.025 --> 35:14.393
- You have to believe me.
- Okay.

35:14.427 --> 35:16.295
- I would never do that.
- I know.

35:16.329 --> 35:17.230
I believe you.

35:20.299 --> 35:22.168
Can you tell me when it started?

35:23.369 --> 35:25.037
The feeling of not being you?

35:27.373 --> 35:28.740
You know about that?

35:37.816 --> 35:38.917
There's a man.

35:41.354 --> 35:43.955
He started sneaking
into my room.

35:46.259 --> 35:49.228
late at night.

35:49.262 --> 35:54.167
He'd crawl. up my bed.

35:54.200 --> 35:59.038
and then he'd kneel on my chest,
until I couldn't breathe.

36:01.374 --> 36:05.011
He'd put his hand
around my neck.

36:05.044 --> 36:10.183
And then. he said
I needed to help him.

36:13.052 --> 36:15.087
When was the first time
you saw this man?

36:18.357 --> 36:19.958
I-I don't know.

36:19.991 --> 36:24.996
It. I-I remember the day.

36:25.031 --> 36:30.936
I was. I-I was. I was at.
I was at Skate City.

36:30.969 --> 36:33.005
Hey, it's okay.

36:33.039 --> 36:34.273
Relax.

36:34.307 --> 36:35.874
Charlie?

36:35.907 --> 36:38.477
Charlie, stay with me.

36:38.511 --> 36:39.445
Charlie!

36:42.881 --> 36:46.252
It's in the air you breathe,
it's in the water you drink,

36:46.285 --> 36:50.122
it's in the blood, flowing
through your veins right now.

36:50.156 --> 36:54.160
We're everywhere, and we're
spreading like wildfire.

36:54.193 --> 36:56.962
Something is coming, Danny-boy.

36:56.995 --> 36:58.997
Something big.

36:59.031 --> 37:01.800
You can't fight this,
so you might as well

37:01.833 --> 37:05.471
just open yourself up,
and let us in.

37:10.042 --> 37:12.078
Help, help!

37:12.111 --> 37:13.112
Let's go.

37:17.316 --> 37:18.284
What?

37:28.194 --> 37:30.829
I take it you saw
our demon friend.

37:33.499 --> 37:34.433
You could say that.

37:37.103 --> 37:39.804
He didn't tell you his name
by any chance, did he?

37:39.838 --> 37:40.872
No such luck.

37:40.905 --> 37:41.840
Hmm.

37:45.944 --> 37:49.348
Hey, we need to help him.

37:51.517 --> 37:53.952
Do you think we have enough
to go to the Archbishop?

37:55.588 --> 38:00.326
Well, we still haven't
found our doorway.

38:00.359 --> 38:01.394
What about the house?

38:04.196 --> 38:05.797
The visions I saw?

38:07.066 --> 38:09.868
Well, the house is where
the seed was planted.

38:09.901 --> 38:12.871
But there must have been
a-a moment

38:12.904 --> 38:15.840
or a tool or-or something
that showed Charlie

38:15.874 --> 38:17.109
how to get to the other side.

38:34.460 --> 38:37.996
Did he say anything that might
have alluded to the source?

38:41.033 --> 38:44.869
Well, he did tell me
he was with some friends

38:44.903 --> 38:46.138
when it happened.

38:46.172 --> 38:48.940
Some skate place, Skate City.

38:48.973 --> 38:50.009
Okay.

38:57.283 --> 38:59.118
That's where it happened.

38:59.151 --> 39:00.286
I mean, it has to be.

39:00.319 --> 39:01.454
- Maybe.
- Right?

39:01.487 --> 39:03.489
Good, right. Come on.

39:03.522 --> 39:04.923
Don't forget your ice pack.

39:37.956 --> 39:39.592
He told me to let it in.

39:39.625 --> 39:40.593
Who, Charlie?

39:43.662 --> 39:45.930
Same thing you told me
in the house.

39:45.964 --> 39:47.299
Of course he did.

39:49.968 --> 39:51.470
That means we have him
right where we want him.

39:52.571 --> 39:53.472
That's good.

40:01.747 --> 40:02.681
You okay?

40:04.983 --> 40:06.152
No, something's wrong.

41:07.480 --> 41:08.781
Keep on, Carson.

41:10.716 --> 41:11.784
Carson, stop it.

41:17.490 --> 41:18.424
Come on, Jazzy.

41:18.457 --> 41:20.326
Come on. Go.

41:20.359 --> 41:21.794
We don't have time for this.

41:21.827 --> 41:22.428
- Come on, finish him.
- You. you're Charlie's friends,

41:22.461 --> 41:24.330
right?

41:24.363 --> 41:26.065
We already talked to the cops.

41:26.098 --> 41:28.501
- Come on, Jazzy!
- Oh, I-I'm not a cop.

41:28.534 --> 41:29.401
What are you doing?

41:31.270 --> 41:32.638
Li-listen,
I'm trying to help.

41:32.671 --> 41:34.106
Can't you see
we're busy, dude?

41:34.139 --> 41:35.140
Fuck off!

41:37.710 --> 41:39.378
What the fuck!

41:39.411 --> 41:41.080
Bro! You were about to
beat the final boss!

41:41.113 --> 41:42.181
You don't think I know that?

41:42.214 --> 41:43.282
I guess
that means you do have time

41:43.315 --> 41:44.350
to talk to us now, right?

41:47.186 --> 41:48.687
All right, fine.

41:48.721 --> 41:50.789
What do you creeps
want to know?

41:58.597 --> 42:00.399
Most people don't know
about this area.

42:01.734 --> 42:04.470
We're not even
supposed to be in here.

42:04.503 --> 42:06.805
Larry uses it to hang out
with his D&D nerds.

42:24.823 --> 42:25.724
This is it.

42:32.298 --> 42:34.233
Charlie used this?

42:34.266 --> 42:35.401
It was Jazzy's fault.

42:36.735 --> 42:38.604
She's the one who dared him
to come down here alone.

42:38.637 --> 42:40.139
Oh, shut up, Aaron!

42:40.172 --> 42:41.373
You dared me first.

42:41.407 --> 42:43.309
But you were the one
who told him it was down here.

42:43.342 --> 42:45.344
Hey, hey,
it's nobody's fault.

42:47.580 --> 42:49.682
Just tell us what happened.

42:49.715 --> 42:51.817
Nothing.
He said he tried it.

42:51.850 --> 42:53.485
That's pretty much it.

42:53.519 --> 42:55.621
No! He said
it worked, Aaron.

42:55.654 --> 42:56.789
It made his hands move!

42:56.822 --> 42:58.524
Dude!
He was bullshitting!

43:03.662 --> 43:05.230
That stuff isn't real.

43:06.665 --> 43:09.134
That's what you think?
Spirits are not real?

43:11.503 --> 43:13.439
Maybe we need to
find out for ourselves.

43:20.446 --> 43:21.380
Okay.

43:22.881 --> 43:24.516
Ready.

43:24.550 --> 43:27.620
Aaaand. action.

43:39.264 --> 43:41.367
Is there a spirit in the room
with us right now?

43:50.209 --> 43:52.311
I'm speaking to the demon
that possessed Charlie.

43:54.346 --> 43:55.581
If you're in here with us.

43:57.850 --> 43:59.284
give us a sign.

44:01.620 --> 44:03.255
Charlie said it worked.

44:07.893 --> 44:08.894
Keep going.

44:17.469 --> 44:19.872
We were having
a conversation earlier.

44:19.905 --> 44:21.373
We didn't finish it.

44:23.676 --> 44:25.244
You asked me to help you.

44:28.681 --> 44:30.215
How do I help you?

44:44.296 --> 44:45.864
Charlie. No, no!

44:52.671 --> 44:53.972
Charlie, no!

45:17.663 --> 45:18.797
What happened?

45:18.831 --> 45:19.965
Dude.

45:22.801 --> 45:25.337
You really
weren't moving that?

45:35.848 --> 45:36.949
What did it spell?

45:39.451 --> 45:40.552
"Evil."

46:02.608 --> 46:06.612
This.
this was foolhardy.

46:06.645 --> 46:08.313
Do you have any idea
of the danger

46:08.347 --> 46:09.448
you've subjected yourself to?

46:09.481 --> 46:11.017
It was. it was my idea.

46:11.050 --> 46:12.384
You should have known better.

46:18.824 --> 46:19.725
Are you all right?

46:22.995 --> 46:25.664
Father Daniel, look at me.

46:25.697 --> 46:27.299
- I said look at me.
- I'm fine!

46:31.070 --> 46:33.906
Your Excellency, I'm. I'm fine.

46:40.612 --> 46:41.580
Good.

46:44.716 --> 46:47.986
It does appear we have
a case of demonic possession.

46:48.021 --> 46:49.022
Unfortunately.

46:51.924 --> 46:54.459
I just. I don't know what.
what's to be done.

46:54.493 --> 46:57.362
We have no way of gaining access
to the boy, Charlie.

46:57.396 --> 47:00.532
What? Why?

47:00.566 --> 47:03.602
I've spoken to the judge,
not two hours ago.

47:03.635 --> 47:05.838
Even now I think Charlie
is undergoing evaluation

47:05.871 --> 47:08.507
to see if he's competent
to stand trial.

47:08.540 --> 47:10.509
They want to move on this
as quickly as possible.

47:10.542 --> 47:12.544
We need to be there!

47:12.578 --> 47:13.612
We need to see him.

47:13.645 --> 47:14.947
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

47:14.980 --> 47:16.548
Well then, make it possible.

47:16.582 --> 47:17.883
What do you mean,
it's not possible?

47:17.916 --> 47:19.418
I don't think
you quite understand.

47:19.451 --> 47:20.552
No, no, no!
I'm not giving up on this.

47:20.586 --> 47:21.587
- I've been through a lot.
- Daniel.

47:21.620 --> 47:22.454
- You don't seem to get it.
- Daniel.

47:23.989 --> 47:25.024
Just let me speak
with the Archbishop

47:25.058 --> 47:26.491
alone for a moment.

47:31.463 --> 47:34.167
Father Daniel,
welcome back.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.767
How's your first day?

47:35.801 --> 47:36.902
I've had better.

47:39.938 --> 47:41.007
I'm sorry to hear that.

47:43.475 --> 47:45.644
If you don't mind me saying,

47:45.677 --> 47:47.146
you do look a little
worse for the wear.

47:49.448 --> 47:50.749
Then I feel how I look.

47:54.519 --> 47:58.124
Probably shouldn't do this,
but. you know what?

48:06.899 --> 48:09.868
Here's my nephew's
contact information.

48:09.902 --> 48:11.603
His name is Kevin.

48:11.637 --> 48:12.871
Father Kevin Dunleavy.

48:12.905 --> 48:18.844
He's an absolutely lovely boy,
though I admit I'm a bit biased.

48:18.877 --> 48:22.547
Anyway, maybe he can help you,

48:22.581 --> 48:24.750
as someone who's
already been through this.

48:26.885 --> 48:27.819
Thank you.

48:29.255 --> 48:30.223
Thank you very much.

48:30.256 --> 48:31.623
Hm. Not at all.

48:34.726 --> 48:37.763
We're relying on you boys
for so much.

48:39.731 --> 48:41.500
Anything I can do to help.

48:49.208 --> 48:53.146
So, we have our permission
to proceed with the exorcism.

48:53.179 --> 48:55.948
Wait, we're doing
the evaluation?

48:55.981 --> 48:57.849
The old man called in a favor.

48:57.883 --> 48:59.985
We'll be able to observe,
but that's about it.

49:00.019 --> 49:01.820
But don't worry,
we'll figure something out.

49:01.853 --> 49:02.688
I think as long as we're there,

49:02.721 --> 49:04.090
we'll have the chance
to get to him.

49:05.891 --> 49:08.027
You sure you're up for this?

49:08.061 --> 49:09.761
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:09.795 --> 49:10.662
I mean, if you want to talk
about what happened...

49:10.696 --> 49:11.596
I said I'm fine!

49:13.632 --> 49:14.833
We're wasting time.

49:21.907 --> 49:24.010
Can you tell me
what you remember

49:24.043 --> 49:28.047
about the night your sister
and parents died, Charlie?

49:28.081 --> 49:31.217
Did something happen
that made you mad at them?

49:34.287 --> 49:35.620
How about your sister, Nellie?

49:37.156 --> 49:39.258
What was your relationship
with her like?

49:43.729 --> 49:44.997
What about the school, Charlie?

49:45.031 --> 49:46.232
How-how you are doing at school?

49:46.265 --> 49:48.201
You-do you get good grades...

49:48.234 --> 49:49.735
You need to go in there.

49:52.305 --> 49:54.007
Look at him.

49:54.040 --> 49:55.241
He's nearly all the way gone.

49:55.274 --> 49:56.908
If we wait any longer,
they're gonna lock him

49:56.942 --> 49:57.876
in a mental hospital

49:57.909 --> 50:00.912
and then what good
are we gonna be to him?

50:00.946 --> 50:03.282
Do you make friends in school?

50:05.951 --> 50:08.087
Do you think you can get it
to show itself again?

50:12.724 --> 50:14.960
These people need to witness
what you saw before.

50:23.102 --> 50:25.271
Are you in charge here?

50:25.304 --> 50:26.705
We need to talk to Charlie.

50:33.212 --> 50:35.580
Um, excuse me.
You-you can't come in here.

50:46.392 --> 50:48.794
Hey Charlie,
do you remember me?

50:51.297 --> 50:52.597
I came to see you earlier.

50:56.169 --> 50:57.903
We had a good talk, didn't we?

51:06.145 --> 51:07.313
You told me about the man.

51:10.682 --> 51:12.051
The one that visited you
in your room.

51:15.054 --> 51:16.322
You see, the thing is,

51:18.391 --> 51:19.758
I think he visited me too.

51:22.828 --> 51:23.829
But I'm just not sure.

51:26.665 --> 51:28.700
So I was hoping
you could describe him to me.

51:33.839 --> 51:34.773
The man?

51:36.209 --> 51:37.909
Yes.
The-the one you told me about.

51:42.348 --> 51:43.882
He was tall.

51:46.285 --> 51:49.155
Tall, that's. that's good.
What else?

51:50.755 --> 51:51.690
He had a beard.

51:56.229 --> 52:00.266
He had long hair and sandals.

52:03.436 --> 52:05.670
Okay.

52:05.704 --> 52:06.705
His hands.

52:10.742 --> 52:11.977
and feet.

52:19.918 --> 52:21.953
They looked
something like that!

52:23.456 --> 52:26.225
Ring any bells for you,
Danny-boy?

52:28.727 --> 52:30.962
You want to know what I remember
about that night?

52:30.996 --> 52:32.165
Jesus!

52:32.198 --> 52:34.033
I remember their screams,

52:34.066 --> 52:36.902
begging for their pitiful
little lives.

52:36.935 --> 52:40.239
I remember my axe,
tearing into their flesh,

52:40.273 --> 52:42.941
cracking their bones like twigs.

52:42.974 --> 52:44.709
I remember their blood,

52:44.743 --> 52:48.147
and their delicious
cries of pain.

52:48.181 --> 52:52.485
And finally,
after it was all done,

52:52.518 --> 52:55.854
I remember relishing
in my masterpiece,

52:55.887 --> 52:58.191
and reveling in the realization.

53:00.393 --> 53:02.228
that we're only
just getting started.

53:20.845 --> 53:22.847
- Great! Are you okay?
- No.

53:22.881 --> 53:24.417
Okay, I am sorry
that has happened.

53:33.459 --> 53:35.294
It's almost time, Daniel.

53:37.563 --> 53:39.098
<i>Nicky!</i>

53:39.131 --> 53:40.433
<i>Nicky!
What did you do?</i>

53:40.466 --> 53:42.068
<i>What did you do to him?</i>

53:42.101 --> 53:43.069
<i>Make him stop!</i>

53:43.102 --> 53:44.437
<i> Nicky!</i>

53:50.576 --> 53:55.914
<i>No! No! No! No!</i>

54:13.366 --> 54:14.333
Father Peter!

54:15.501 --> 54:17.370
He's gone.

54:17.403 --> 54:19.205
Impossible.

54:19.238 --> 54:20.539
What are you waiting for? Go!

54:27.480 --> 54:28.381
What the.

54:30.216 --> 54:31.517
Hello?

54:31.550 --> 54:33.185
Are you all
seeing this out there?

54:34.420 --> 54:35.221
What the hell was that?

54:35.254 --> 54:36.055
There's
something in here!

54:36.088 --> 54:38.090
Jesus.

54:38.124 --> 54:39.091
Get it off me!

54:40.925 --> 54:42.328
What is happening?

54:46.065 --> 54:48.534
Oh, my God.

54:57.209 --> 54:58.511
Oh, my God.

55:41.920 --> 55:44.123
Daniel.

56:08.047 --> 56:09.014
Hello?

56:12.051 --> 56:14.353
It's Father Daniel.

56:14.387 --> 56:16.389
Oh, thank God!

56:16.422 --> 56:17.956
Are you okay?

56:17.989 --> 56:19.458
Yes, I'm fine. You?

56:21.127 --> 56:22.927
Yeah.

56:22.961 --> 56:25.297
Have you seen Father Peter?

56:25.331 --> 56:28.067
No. I-I was hiding.

56:28.100 --> 56:29.635
I-I haven't seen anyone.

56:29.668 --> 56:32.271
I just came...

56:32.304 --> 56:34.573
Help!

56:50.256 --> 56:53.292
Danny-boy.

57:00.332 --> 57:04.170
Here I come.

57:07.239 --> 57:08.340
Excuse me.

57:10.209 --> 57:13.479
Ma'am, we need help.

57:15.014 --> 57:15.947
I'm sorry, but...

57:34.033 --> 57:35.167
I won't run from you, Charlie.

57:37.803 --> 57:38.970
I know you can hear me!

57:40.406 --> 57:41.407
You can fight this!

57:43.509 --> 57:44.477
We can get through
this together.

57:46.378 --> 57:49.114
You have to trust me!
You have to trust me!

57:49.148 --> 57:50.349
Charlie, look at me!

57:50.382 --> 57:52.685
Charlie, Charlie, look at me.

57:54.386 --> 57:57.056
What's happening to me?

57:57.089 --> 58:00.025
Oh, yes. There you are.

58:00.059 --> 58:02.661
It's okay. It's okay.

58:02.695 --> 58:06.031
I've got you.

58:06.065 --> 58:07.533
I've got you.

58:07.566 --> 58:08.534
No.

58:11.403 --> 58:12.338
It's him.

58:18.544 --> 58:19.545
The man.

58:48.107 --> 58:50.342
How long
will the sedative last?

58:50.376 --> 58:51.277
Long enough.

58:58.684 --> 59:03.689
The boy. the one that died
during your first exorcism.

59:06.725 --> 59:08.093
How did it happen?

59:10.229 --> 59:11.630
It was simple.

59:11.664 --> 59:12.765
The demon was.

59:14.366 --> 59:15.467
was the strongest
I've ever seen.

59:19.572 --> 59:21.340
I guess you were just lucky
to get out of there alive.

59:22.541 --> 59:23.475
Sure.

59:25.210 --> 59:27.313
Look, an innocent young soul
was completely destroyed

59:27.346 --> 59:29.448
by evil that day,
under my watch.

59:29.481 --> 59:32.351
So, yeah, I'm lucky to be alive.

59:33.752 --> 59:34.853
You know what I witnessed?

59:37.156 --> 59:38.390
It's the epitome of darkness.

59:40.159 --> 59:41.160
Worse than death, if you ask me.

59:42.561 --> 59:44.296
I would just pray that
you never have to experience

59:44.330 --> 59:45.297
anything like that yourself.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:39.585
I thought you might need these.

01:00:43.522 --> 01:00:48.727
They were. handed down
to me from my mentor.

01:00:53.866 --> 01:00:54.833
And now it's your turn.

01:01:01.774 --> 01:01:05.344
And did you believe in.
in your other recruits?

01:01:09.015 --> 01:01:10.249
The way you do with me?

01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:14.219
When I was done with them, yes.

01:01:20.859 --> 01:01:25.431
It's just, you've been
training all these exorcists.

01:01:27.299 --> 01:01:30.402
But the Archbishop says that
things still keep getting worse,

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:31.837
- and it just...
- Enough, enough!

01:01:34.007 --> 01:01:36.608
There's a young boy
in that other room,

01:01:36.642 --> 01:01:40.446
whose life you hold
solely in your hands.

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:41.814
Okay?

01:01:41.847 --> 01:01:43.549
You and you alone
are responsible

01:01:43.582 --> 01:01:45.484
for whatever happens
to him tonight.

01:01:45.517 --> 01:01:48.620
That's what you should be
focused on, nothing else.

01:01:48.654 --> 01:01:49.555
Do you understand?

01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:53.592
Okay, good.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:55.627
He'll be awake soon,
so be ready.

01:02:20.352 --> 01:02:21.353
<i>Hello?</i>

01:02:21.386 --> 01:02:22.955
Hey!

01:02:22.988 --> 01:02:27.292
Hey, hello.
Is this Father Kevin Dunleavy?

01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:28.293
<i>Speaking.</i>

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:30.329
Yeah, sorry to bother you.

01:02:30.362 --> 01:02:31.396
- This is...
- <i>Father Daniel.</i>

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:32.331
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

01:02:35.634 --> 01:02:37.369
Oh, your aunt
told you I was...

01:02:37.402 --> 01:02:39.438
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

01:02:39.471 --> 01:02:40.639
<i>You're so close.</i>

01:02:42.741 --> 01:02:46.779
So close. to what?

01:02:46.812 --> 01:02:48.014
<i>Just one final task,</i>

01:02:48.047 --> 01:02:49.648
<i>and you'll be with us.</i>

01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:51.683
<i>You won't regret it, Daniel.</i>

01:02:51.717 --> 01:02:52.651
<i>I promise.</i>

01:02:53.886 --> 01:02:56.522
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:02:56.555 --> 01:02:58.423
Who is "us"?

01:03:23.082 --> 01:03:24.750
Father Peter!
You. you scared me.

01:03:26.885 --> 01:03:30.089
I was. I was praying.

01:03:33.159 --> 01:03:34.093
It's time.

01:03:48.874 --> 01:03:52.477
Father Daniel, please.

01:03:52.511 --> 01:03:54.613
It's okay, Charlie.

01:03:54.646 --> 01:03:55.647
I'm here with you

01:03:55.681 --> 01:03:57.749
and I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

01:04:01.954 --> 01:04:03.089
You trust me,
don't you, Charlie?

01:04:08.694 --> 01:04:09.628
Well, good.

01:04:11.197 --> 01:04:12.065
Because I trust you.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.568
That means we're a team now.

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:17.536
And we're in this together.

01:04:19.872 --> 01:04:20.806
Okay?

01:04:24.509 --> 01:04:25.477
Father Daniel.

01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:28.981
Let's begin.

01:04:40.492 --> 01:04:44.030
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

01:04:46.032 --> 01:04:46.999
Amen.

01:04:47.033 --> 01:04:47.966
Amen.

01:04:56.209 --> 01:04:59.212
Most glorious prince
of the heavenly Armies,

01:04:59.245 --> 01:05:02.447
Saint Michael the Archangel,
defend us in our battle

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.883
against principalities
and powers,

01:05:04.917 --> 01:05:07.786
against the rulers
of this world of darkness,

01:05:07.819 --> 01:05:11.857
against the spirits of
wickedness in the high places.

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:13.859
Come to the assistance of men,

01:05:13.892 --> 01:05:16.229
whom God has created
to His likeness,

01:05:16.262 --> 01:05:19.531
and whom He has redeemed
at a great price

01:05:19.564 --> 01:05:20.632
from the tyranny of the devil.

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:21.733
Ahhh!

01:05:21.767 --> 01:05:22.968
Hey Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie, fight it.

01:05:23.001 --> 01:05:24.970
Father, the prayer.

01:05:28.974 --> 01:05:32.245
The Holy Church venerates you,
as her guardian and protector;

01:05:32.278 --> 01:05:35.048
to you, the Lord has entrusted
the souls of the redeemed

01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:37.150
to be led into heaven.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.185
We pray there
for the God of peace

01:05:39.218 --> 01:05:40.919
to crush Satan
beneath our feet.

01:05:40.953 --> 01:05:42.088
Aaaah!

01:05:42.121 --> 01:05:42.988
- Charlie!
- Focus!

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:44.856
- Charlie!
- Focus! You need to be stronger!

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:45.791
More forceful!

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:53.932
Pray, therefore,
to the God of peace,

01:05:53.966 --> 01:05:57.203
to crush Satan beneath our feet,
that he may no longer retain

01:05:57.236 --> 01:06:00.273
men captive
and do injury to the Church!

01:06:00.306 --> 01:06:02.607
Offer our prayers
to the most high,

01:06:02.641 --> 01:06:05.944
that without delay they may draw
His mercy down upon us.

01:06:05.978 --> 01:06:07.946
Take hold of the dragon!

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.583
The old serpent,
which is the devil and Satan!

01:06:11.616 --> 01:06:14.087
Bind him and cast him
into the bottomless pit!

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.123
That he may no longer
seduce the nations.

01:06:31.337 --> 01:06:35.674
Danny-boy,
you came back for more.

01:06:35.707 --> 01:06:37.576
I knew you would.

01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:40.579
You're drawn to me, aren't you?

01:06:40.612 --> 01:06:43.782
Like two peas in a pod,
you and me.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:48.254
Charlie, if you can hear me,
I'm here with you.

01:06:48.287 --> 01:06:50.189
Listen to my voice,
follow my voice.

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:53.326
It's what it wants!

01:06:53.359 --> 01:06:54.960
Charlie cannot help you.
No one can help you.

01:06:54.993 --> 01:06:56.162
It's up to you to fight this!

01:06:59.032 --> 01:07:00.832
What are you waiting for?

01:07:00.866 --> 01:07:02.701
Yes, come on, Danny-boy.

01:07:02.734 --> 01:07:04.103
Let's get on with it.

01:07:10.842 --> 01:07:13.845
In the name of Jesus Christ,
our God and Lord!

01:07:13.879 --> 01:07:16.715
Strengthened by the intercession
of the Immaculate Virgin Mary,

01:07:16.748 --> 01:07:17.949
Mother of God!

01:07:17.983 --> 01:07:19.851
Of blessed Michael
the Archangel!

01:07:19.885 --> 01:07:23.356
Of the blessed Apostles Peter
and Paul and all the saints!

01:07:23.389 --> 01:07:26.792
And powerful in the holy
authority of our ministry,

01:07:26.825 --> 01:07:29.228
we confidently undertake
to repulse the attacks

01:07:29.262 --> 01:07:30.729
and deceits of the devil!

01:07:30.762 --> 01:07:32.265
Let God arise!

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.598
Let his enemies be scattered!

01:07:34.866 --> 01:07:38.037
Let those who hate him
also flee before him.

01:07:38.071 --> 01:07:41.706
As smoke is driven away,
so drive them away.

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:45.844
As wax melteth before the fire,
let the wicked perish

01:07:45.877 --> 01:07:47.013
at the presence of God!

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.714
Charlie, Charlie!

01:07:49.748 --> 01:07:51.050
The prayer, Father!

01:07:51.084 --> 01:07:52.285
No, no, I heard him! It's him!

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:54.287
No, it's the demon!

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.090
It's preying on your weakness.
You have to fight!

01:08:03.895 --> 01:08:07.300
Behold the cross of the Lord,
flee bands of enemies.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.368
The lion of the tribe of Judah,

01:08:09.402 --> 01:08:12.071
the offspring of David,
hath conquered!

01:08:12.105 --> 01:08:14.906
May Thy mercy,
Lord, descend upon us.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.675
As great as our hope in Thee!

01:08:16.707 --> 01:08:20.179
Ah! It burns.

01:08:20.212 --> 01:08:22.981
Father Daniel, it burns!

01:08:24.117 --> 01:08:25.318
Finish it, Daniel!

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.220
You're almost there!
You're doing it!

01:08:32.225 --> 01:08:35.394
All satanic powers,
all infernal invaders,

01:08:35.428 --> 01:08:38.697
all wicked legions,
and the. the.

01:08:41.167 --> 01:08:44.069
<i>Ten-year-old boy,
Nicholas Miller.</i>

01:08:44.103 --> 01:08:47.872
<i>He burned to death on his bed,
right in front of me.</i>

01:08:47.906 --> 01:08:50.709
<i>The demon was the strongest
I've ever seen.</i>

01:08:50.742 --> 01:08:52.743
<i>Evil is clever.</i>

01:08:52.777 --> 01:08:55.448
<i>Demons are unpredictable.</i>

01:08:55.481 --> 01:08:57.948
<i>They don't scream
their presence.</i>

01:08:57.983 --> 01:09:00.419
<i>They hide in places
where we least expect them.</i>

01:09:02.821 --> 01:09:03.822
<i>Why're you here?</i>

01:09:06.492 --> 01:09:08.894
Daniel! You can't let up!
Drive it out!

01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:19.238
Most cunning serpent!

01:09:19.272 --> 01:09:21.840
You shall no more dare
to deceive the human race.

01:09:21.872 --> 01:09:22.974
What are you doing?

01:09:23.009 --> 01:09:24.876
The most high God commands you!

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:26.711
He with whom,
in your great insolence,

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:28.413
you still claim to be equal!

01:09:28.447 --> 01:09:29.747
Have you lost your mind?

01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:31.017
God, who wants all men
to be saved!

01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:32.783
And to come to the knowledge
of the truth.

01:09:32.817 --> 01:09:34.153
God the Father commands you!

01:09:34.187 --> 01:09:35.720
God the Son commands you!

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:37.390
God the Holy Ghost commands you!

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:38.990
I am warning you. Stop this!

01:09:39.024 --> 01:09:42.228
I'm not stopping, Peter.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.962
Or do you want to tell me
your real name?

01:10:00.313 --> 01:10:03.015
Very clever, Daniel. Bravo.

01:10:06.152 --> 01:10:09.754
No, I'm not quite finished
with you yet.

01:10:09.788 --> 01:10:12.791
You're trying to be brave, yeah?

01:10:12.824 --> 01:10:15.860
You're trying to be strong
and I applaud you for that.

01:10:17.829 --> 01:10:21.766
But you know what you
really are. deep down?

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:26.838
You're a coward.

01:10:26.871 --> 01:10:30.343
You're a lost little sheep,
looking for a shepherd.

01:10:30.376 --> 01:10:32.844
I'm not a coward.

01:10:32.877 --> 01:10:34.879
I know exactly why I'm here.

01:10:34.913 --> 01:10:36.015
We'll see.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:47.879
Is that all you got?

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.360
Charlie isn't the first,
Daniel.

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.631
And he won't be the last.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.436
We've all made sacrifices,
Daniel.

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.075
It's not real.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:30.423
Ah!

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:07.560
The heavens
and the earth were finished,

01:14:07.593 --> 01:14:10.563
and all the host of them.

01:14:10.596 --> 01:14:15.067
On the seventh day, God finished
his work which he had made;

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.671
and he rested on the seventh day
from all his work

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.739
which He had made.

01:14:31.317 --> 01:14:33.185
Even your almighty God
had to take a breather

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:35.254
from time to time, Daniel.

01:14:53.472 --> 01:14:55.774
Hmm! Ripe!

01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:06.752
You recall me telling you

01:15:06.785 --> 01:15:09.722
losing that boy,
Nicholas Miller,

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.357
was worse than death?

01:15:14.326 --> 01:15:15.261
That was a lie.

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:21.133
Death is infinitely worse.

01:15:21.166 --> 01:15:22.668
Especially the death
I have planned for you,

01:15:22.701 --> 01:15:24.236
if you don't do what I want.

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:36.815
Oh, Daniel,
this was supposed to be easy.

01:15:36.849 --> 01:15:40.319
You kill the boy, and you
take on our demon friend.

01:15:40.352 --> 01:15:44.590
I mean, this waste of a soul
Father Peter did it.

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:46.158
Look how that worked out.

01:15:46.191 --> 01:15:47.726
I swear,
if you touch that boy.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.762
I had you primed
like an empty vessel,

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:51.497
ready to be filled.

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:54.867
All you had to do
was complete the exorcism!

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:59.271
I mean, you are an exorcist!

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:02.207
Yes, it's all there in the name!

01:16:02.241 --> 01:16:04.476
If you're so powerful,
and I'm so weak,

01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:06.345
why do you need me?

01:16:06.378 --> 01:16:08.614
A war needs an army.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.482
An army needs soldiers.

01:16:10.516 --> 01:16:13.152
I'll never fight for you.

01:16:13.185 --> 01:16:15.421
You won't have a choice.

01:16:15.454 --> 01:16:17.089
You always a choice!

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:13.245
I'm sorry.

01:17:17.249 --> 01:17:23.155
No. I thank you.

01:17:24.456 --> 01:17:25.324
Thank you.

01:17:57.690 --> 01:18:02.695
<i>Daniel, not now, Daniel.</i>

01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:07.466
<i>Did you think you'd be
rid of me that easily?</i>

01:18:07.499 --> 01:18:10.602
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

01:18:10.636 --> 01:18:12.671
<i>Let me in.</i>

01:18:12.705 --> 01:18:15.507
No! No!

01:18:15.541 --> 01:18:20.946
<i>You can't deny
the truth, Daniel.</i>

01:18:20.979 --> 01:18:22.448
<i>You can feel it.</i>

01:18:22.481 --> 01:18:23.916
No, no,
you're not getting that.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.684
I'm not letting you.
I'm not letting you. Just stop.

01:18:25.718 --> 01:18:29.521
<i>There's no place
for you here, not anymore.</i>

01:18:32.025 --> 01:18:34.660
Leave me alone.

01:18:34.693 --> 01:18:38.797
<i>Just relax.</i>

01:18:38.831 --> 01:18:41.834
<i>Let it take hold.</i>

01:18:41.867 --> 01:18:46.305
<i>Feel the power, Daniel.</i>

01:18:47.439 --> 01:18:51.044
<i>Feel the possibility.</i>

01:18:51.077 --> 01:18:54.047
<i>Smile, Daniel.</i>

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.050
<i>It's almost over.</i>

01:18:57.083 --> 01:19:01.520
<i>You can rest soon.</i>

01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.924
Hey, Charlie.

01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:49.062
It's gone.

01:20:52.831 --> 01:20:54.933
Yeah.

01:20:54.967 --> 01:20:55.934
Let's get out of here.

01:21:24.063 --> 01:21:25.864
This is all of them.

01:21:25.898 --> 01:21:29.701
Every recruit
trained by Father Peter.

01:21:32.504 --> 01:21:34.140
Without Father Peter's
influence,

01:21:34.173 --> 01:21:38.543
your second exorcism of Charlie
was flawless, Father Daniel.

01:21:38.577 --> 01:21:42.447
He's recuperating downstairs
as we speak.

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:45.617
I think it best to keep this
within the leadership for now.

01:21:49.888 --> 01:21:52.724
Thank you for these.

01:21:52.758 --> 01:21:55.794
You know, Daniel.

01:21:55.827 --> 01:21:58.730
this really
isn't your responsibility.

01:21:58.764 --> 01:22:00.732
The Vatican is completely aware
of the situation

01:22:00.766 --> 01:22:01.767
and has a plan to take...

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.469
No offense.
Your Excellency,

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:07.739
to you or the Vatican.

01:22:07.773 --> 01:22:11.543
but I don't want to wait for
someone else to do what's right.

01:22:14.646 --> 01:22:16.581
You've got quite a journey
ahead of you.

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:19.451
Yeah.

01:22:26.125 --> 01:22:27.592
Will you take care of Charlie?

01:22:32.265 --> 01:22:34.633
He'll be fine.

01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:36.135
I give you my word.
