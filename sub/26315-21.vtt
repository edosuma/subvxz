WEBVTT

00:00.141 --> 00:01.557
Previously on Mom...

00:02.242 --> 00:04.648
I'm not angry, I just
don't need a new car.

00:05.156 --> 00:07.093
I don't want to fight. I don't either.

00:07.118 --> 00:08.868
Good, because I bought you the car.

00:08.893 --> 00:09.710
What?

00:09.750 --> 00:11.733
I worked my ass off to get here!

00:11.758 --> 00:13.808
And, yes, I said
"ass." I was a stripper.

00:13.833 --> 00:16.109
I don't know why I
keep bringing that up.

00:16.896 --> 00:18.396
My law firm would like to offer you

00:18.431 --> 00:19.960
a paying position this summer.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.849
Oh, my God.

00:22.005 --> 00:23.405
Thank you.

00:23.687 --> 00:25.853
There are therapists who
deal with this stuff for free.

00:25.939 --> 00:27.693
Wendy gave you that guy's number.

00:27.718 --> 00:29.941
Fine, I'll go to a therapist. You happy?

00:30.086 --> 00:32.887
I'm sensing some resistance
to your treating your ADD.

00:32.912 --> 00:34.640
Is that what you're sensing?

00:36.559 --> 00:38.559
_

00:43.373 --> 00:45.632
That's your third snooze.

00:46.459 --> 00:48.843
Can you not talk? I'm trying to sleep.

00:48.868 --> 00:52.546
So am I, but some jerk's
alarm keeps going off.

00:53.466 --> 00:55.967
I don't have to move my car until 7:00.

00:55.992 --> 00:58.376
Then why do I have to get up at 6:00?

00:58.401 --> 01:00.785
And 6:08? And 6:16?

01:02.776 --> 01:05.393
I need a slow transition
from sleeping to wakefulness,

01:05.477 --> 01:08.646
but I guess I'm not allowed
to ask for my needs to be met.

01:08.732 --> 01:11.399
Please, no therapy speak before coffee.

01:11.484 --> 01:13.901
Wow, Trevor says some
people are threatened

01:13.926 --> 01:15.463
by their partner's growth.

01:15.750 --> 01:16.904
Trevor's lucky.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.407
He only has to deal
with you an hour a week.

01:20.078 --> 01:21.730
You know, your level of anger

01:21.755 --> 01:23.805
is completely out of
proportion to the situation,

01:23.830 --> 01:26.214
which leads me to believe
that this is transference.

01:26.239 --> 01:27.475
What are you really angry about?

01:27.500 --> 01:28.549
I'm looking at it.

01:28.574 --> 01:29.773
Ooh, sorry.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.117
The correct answer is your mother.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.808
Aw, look at you.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.800
Too excited about your new job to sleep?

01:38.825 --> 01:40.908
Yup, I can't wait.

01:40.933 --> 01:42.733
I organized my briefcase.

01:42.758 --> 01:45.342
I've got pencils, paper
and a power bar for,

01:45.367 --> 01:47.617
you know, power.

01:48.154 --> 01:50.071
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

01:50.096 --> 01:51.916
But I'll probably get
killed in a freak accident

01:51.941 --> 01:53.491
before I even get to the office.

01:53.526 --> 01:54.692
Why would you say that?

01:54.717 --> 01:56.717
Because that's how my life works.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.623
I'm starting a summer
job at a big law firm.

01:59.648 --> 02:02.236
This would totally be the day
a plane drops out of the sky

02:02.261 --> 02:04.031
and squishes me like a bug.

02:04.617 --> 02:05.703
I see.

02:05.728 --> 02:08.257
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

02:09.398 --> 02:12.260
But, hey, since you got time
to kill, can you move my car?

02:12.285 --> 02:14.439
Your car is parked next
to mine in the carport.

02:14.464 --> 02:15.596
That's my new car.

02:15.621 --> 02:17.776
My old car is parked two
blocks away just past the house

02:17.801 --> 02:19.967
with the scary old lady who
stares out the window all day.

02:20.453 --> 02:21.613
That's a woman?

02:21.638 --> 02:23.054
Yeah, I thought it was a man, too,,

02:23.079 --> 02:24.671
until the day the robe fell open.

02:27.527 --> 02:29.171
Looking for falling planes?

02:29.717 --> 02:32.852
Yes, but it's the one you
don't see that always gets you.

02:39.509 --> 02:42.593
Bonnie, turn off the damn alarm!

02:43.493 --> 02:45.910
Man, his mother screwed him up.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074

03:07.195 --> 03:09.412
That's the conference rooms

03:09.437 --> 03:11.437
And here's your office.

03:11.510 --> 03:13.176
I get my own office?

03:13.201 --> 03:15.085
Well, you do have a roommate.

03:15.695 --> 03:19.843
Christy Plunkett, meet the MXM-753N.

03:21.661 --> 03:23.671
Oh.

03:24.847 --> 03:26.146
Hello.

03:27.963 --> 03:30.547
Make 25 copies of this
for the 11:00 meeting.

03:30.774 --> 03:32.657
Do you want me to come to the meeting?

03:32.682 --> 03:34.882
Yes. To drop off the copies.

03:36.413 --> 03:37.562
Copy that.

03:37.770 --> 03:40.071
Just a heads up: finger
guns are considered

03:40.096 --> 03:41.896
a micro-aggression around here.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.773
Copy that.

03:48.265 --> 03:50.414
So I have to move my car
a few mornings a week.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.648
Why does he have to make
a federal case out of it?

03:52.673 --> 03:56.125
I think he's just perpetuating
his own victim-hood.

03:57.163 --> 03:59.997
You do an amazing job at
remembering therapy terms

04:00.022 --> 04:01.945
and completely misusing them.

04:02.464 --> 04:03.992
Thank you.

04:04.831 --> 04:06.497
You're also skilled at ignoring

04:06.522 --> 04:08.739
the parts of what I say
that you don't want to hear.

04:08.875 --> 04:11.304
So many compliments today.

04:11.741 --> 04:14.822
Look, if I had an extra
parking space for my old car,

04:14.847 --> 04:17.298
I'd use it, but I don't,
and Adam should respect that.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.382
You still have your old car?

04:18.406 --> 04:20.382
And Adam should respect that.

04:20.947 --> 04:22.830
Why are you hanging on to something

04:22.855 --> 04:24.388
that's clearly causing you problems?

04:24.473 --> 04:26.984
Uh, because I love him.

04:30.982 --> 04:33.859
Uh, still talking about the car.

04:35.729 --> 04:38.078
I find it interesting that
for the first time in your life

04:38.103 --> 04:41.104
you've got a new car, and yet
you can't let go of the old one.

04:41.129 --> 04:42.907
It's no big deal. I just
haven't gotten around

04:42.932 --> 04:44.969
- to getting rid of it yet.
- It's been a month.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.410
Yeah, exactly, it's only been a month.

04:46.556 --> 04:49.281
Or it's been a whole month.

04:49.681 --> 04:50.570
Why are you attacking me?

04:50.595 --> 04:52.593
Do I remind you of your mother?

04:54.675 --> 04:57.142
Procrastination is a
common symptom of ADD.

04:57.167 --> 04:59.917
Boring me is a common symptom of you.

05:00.165 --> 05:03.333
Your assignment this week is
to get rid of that old car.

05:03.358 --> 05:05.441
That is your only job.

05:05.483 --> 05:06.649
What about my regular job?

05:07.726 --> 05:09.304
Of course, do your regular job.

05:09.329 --> 05:11.414
What about household chores?
Do I have to do those?

05:11.454 --> 05:14.171
You're being deliberately obtuse.

05:14.196 --> 05:17.113
Why are you angry? Is this transference?

05:17.792 --> 05:20.023
I never should've taught you that word.

05:23.344 --> 05:25.511
Wendy, could you
please pass me the salt?

05:26.046 --> 05:27.585
Better do it before she starts ranting

05:27.610 --> 05:29.527
about her needs not being met.

05:29.645 --> 05:31.732
That's a little
passive-aggressive, Jill.

05:31.757 --> 05:34.041
You know, Trevor says my
friend group might be threatened

05:34.066 --> 05:35.316
by my personal growth.

05:35.521 --> 05:37.104
If we were still boozin' it up,

05:37.129 --> 05:39.129
"Trevor Says" would be
a great drinking game.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.062
So hammered, so fast.

05:42.635 --> 05:44.301
I don't like everything Trevor says.

05:44.326 --> 05:46.125
This week, he actually gave me homework

05:46.150 --> 05:47.421
because he thinks I procrastinate,

05:47.446 --> 05:49.280
which is only because I have ADD.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.223
"Because I Have ADD" would
be another good drinking game.

05:52.266 --> 05:53.843
We'd be dead.

05:54.638 --> 05:56.839
You don't have to have
ADD to procrastinate.

05:57.127 --> 05:59.210
I got a package meant for
my neighbors at Christmas,

05:59.235 --> 06:00.835
and I still haven't taken it over there.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.859
That's not so bad.

06:02.044 --> 06:03.627
It's been three years.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.990
I've been putting something off, too.

06:07.015 --> 06:09.770
I still haven't listened to
a voice mail Victor left me

06:09.795 --> 06:11.795
a couple of days before he died.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.953
Aw, that's so sad. Don't
you want to hear his voice?

06:13.978 --> 06:16.611
I don't know. We had a hard day,

06:16.636 --> 06:19.086
and I'm afraid he was calling
because he was mad at me,

06:19.111 --> 06:21.695
and I don't want that to be
the last thing I hear him say.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.007
Well, it'll all get cleared
up when you join him in heaven.

06:24.236 --> 06:26.036
Oh, my God, Bonnie.

06:26.235 --> 06:27.785
What? It's sweet.

06:27.810 --> 06:29.309
I'm pretending to believe in heaven.

06:30.836 --> 06:32.218
I never procrastinate.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.850
How is that possible?

06:34.020 --> 06:36.109
I created a special calendar

06:36.134 --> 06:38.551
where I list all the
tasks I need to get done,

06:38.576 --> 06:42.044
ranked by date, priority
and my level of resistance.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.781
I call it the Wen-dalendar.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.039
Well, that is so boring
I want to Wen-dalen-die.

06:52.156 --> 06:54.455
I love writing things
down and checking them off.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.517
Sometimes I write down
things I've already done

06:56.542 --> 06:58.257
just so I can...

06:59.295 --> 07:00.594
Well, I've been bugging you

07:00.619 --> 07:02.490
to get a driver's
license for six months.

07:02.515 --> 07:04.631
I'm a bit tired of being your chauffeur.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.777
I thought we decided we
weren't gonna talk about

07:06.802 --> 07:08.552
roommate stuff in front of the group.

07:08.577 --> 07:09.994
We never discussed that.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.813
Well, we should.

07:14.527 --> 07:15.559
Hey.

07:15.584 --> 07:17.251
- Hey.
- Hey, stranger.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.648
How's your fancy job?

07:18.673 --> 07:20.703
Oh, it's good. It's good.

07:20.927 --> 07:23.010
I mean, I can't really talk about it

07:23.035 --> 07:25.379
'cause of attorney-client privilege.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.154
Oh, I got so screwed on that once.

07:27.179 --> 07:29.183
I told this lawyer all
these things I'd done,

07:29.208 --> 07:30.703
and then he brought it all up in court,

07:30.779 --> 07:33.079
which is when I learned
it has to be your lawyer.

07:34.546 --> 07:36.797
Bottom line, if they
don't sit at your table,

07:36.822 --> 07:38.739
don't tell them anything.

07:38.884 --> 07:40.922
Oh, that's funny.

07:40.947 --> 07:42.530
It reminds me of work,

07:42.555 --> 07:45.429
where I also laugh all day
with my legal colleagues.

07:46.820 --> 07:48.392
I'm not buying it.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.644
Yeah, if you're not
complaining, you're not Christy.

07:50.669 --> 07:52.335
That is so not true.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.437
Fine! My new job blows. I'm miserable.

07:56.055 --> 07:58.438
Hey, look, Christy has a drinking game.

07:58.463 --> 08:01.048
I thought I was gonna have
some real responsibility,

08:01.073 --> 08:02.940
but I'm just making copies.

08:03.219 --> 08:05.102
I hate my life.

08:10.952 --> 08:13.394
Well, I hope you're happy!

08:14.109 --> 08:16.335
I don't think you mean that.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.872
"Don't hit the snooze," you said.

08:18.897 --> 08:21.102
"Wake up right before
you need to," you said.

08:21.187 --> 08:23.270
Well, because of you, I got a ticket.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.095
I think because of
you, you got a ticket.

08:25.131 --> 08:26.630
You're the one that has two cars.

08:26.655 --> 08:27.562
Well, for your information,

08:27.587 --> 08:29.777
I've decided to get rid of my old car.

08:29.802 --> 08:30.929
I'll believe it when I see it.

08:30.954 --> 08:32.375
Well, get ready to see it,

08:32.400 --> 08:34.687
because I'm gonna do
it first thing today.

08:36.562 --> 08:38.597
Hi. I'm Bonnie Plunkett,
your building manager.

08:38.621 --> 08:40.538
Do you need anything
repaired? Anything at all?

08:40.563 --> 08:41.710
Faucets, toilets?

08:41.735 --> 08:44.054
Curious about how long anything is?

08:46.476 --> 08:48.445
Thank you for squeezing me in

08:48.470 --> 08:50.187
on such short notice.

08:51.550 --> 08:53.267
"Beef bourguignon,

08:53.292 --> 08:54.908
"traditional French braised stew.

08:54.933 --> 08:56.971
Total time, six to eight hours."

08:56.996 --> 08:58.629
Well, let's get at it.

09:04.381 --> 09:06.614
I screwed up. I ordered
chicken paillard,

09:06.639 --> 09:08.138
but it was supposed
to be a hanger steak.

09:09.318 --> 09:10.484
It's true.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.952
After all these years,
she's still not good at this.

09:14.430 --> 09:15.896
Please help me.

09:15.921 --> 09:18.589
That table may be my only
decent tip of the night.

09:18.614 --> 09:20.164
Oh. Well, that changes everything.

09:20.189 --> 09:21.689
Uh, listen up, everyone.

09:21.854 --> 09:24.488
Christy needs money.
Let's really pull together.

09:28.037 --> 09:29.336
Oh, my God.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.944
The law firm that I'm working for

09:30.969 --> 09:32.435
needs me to come in right now.

09:32.591 --> 09:34.341
"Big case, all hands on deck.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.023
We need you ASAP."

09:36.669 --> 09:39.039
Guys, I'm needed.

09:39.064 --> 09:42.115
But you're in the middle of
poorly serving our customers.

09:42.351 --> 09:43.671
I don't care.

09:43.696 --> 09:45.509
I am gonna go do something with meaning,

09:45.544 --> 09:47.010
something important,

09:47.046 --> 09:48.879
something that doesn't
involve sauce on the side,

09:48.904 --> 09:50.851
'cause I am meant for greater things.

09:50.876 --> 09:52.175
You can't just leave.

09:52.402 --> 09:53.702
Watch me.

09:58.411 --> 10:00.544
Well, that was worth watching.

10:02.085 --> 10:03.257
Oh.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.345
- I came as fast as I could.
- Don't care.

10:05.370 --> 10:07.203
We got thrown a curve-ball
on the Hawkins trial.

10:07.228 --> 10:08.570
Probably gonna be an all-nighter.

10:08.761 --> 10:11.345
Do you need me to help draft a brief?

10:11.370 --> 10:12.619
Research precedents?

10:12.644 --> 10:14.010
We need you to pick up dinner.

10:14.035 --> 10:15.455
- What?
- Yeah, we already ordered

10:15.480 --> 10:16.835
from the boss's favorite restaurant.

10:28.337 --> 10:31.471
Is there a chance we
could be adults about this?

10:31.496 --> 10:32.640
Of course.

10:32.665 --> 10:35.058
This must be very humbling for you,

10:35.083 --> 10:37.583
and so we've decided not
to rub your nose in it.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.140
- Really?
- No. Paul, the list.

10:41.567 --> 10:44.531
We all kind of
work-shopped these together.

10:44.774 --> 10:47.358
"Your life hasn't changed
that much, Counselor,

10:47.383 --> 10:49.466
and here is exhibit A."

10:52.399 --> 10:56.117
"What case are you working
on? Christy v. Dignity?"

10:57.949 --> 10:59.281
That was Preston.

11:01.421 --> 11:02.452
Okay.

11:02.477 --> 11:04.060
Oh, uh, buh-buh, one more.

11:05.352 --> 11:07.068
"Apparently Law & Order

11:07.093 --> 11:09.510
means law and order dinner."

11:11.964 --> 11:14.304
Make all the jokes you want.

11:14.329 --> 11:16.828
Nothing could make me feel
worse about myself right now.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.695
Ah!

11:28.720 --> 11:30.253
I hate this place!

11:35.694 --> 11:38.061
I had one thing to do yesterday...

11:38.086 --> 11:40.936
get rid of my old car. But did I? No.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.395
I did a bunch of things I
didn't want to do instead.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.914
I even texted Wendy
just to say, "What's up?"

11:46.485 --> 11:48.285
Oh, that's why.

11:49.937 --> 11:51.469
Guess my only comfort is knowing

11:51.494 --> 11:53.679
you guys are struggling
with procrastination, too.

11:53.882 --> 11:55.832
I got my license!

11:56.145 --> 11:58.362
And I had a blast at the DMV.

11:58.494 --> 12:00.778
Everyone's so friendly and outgoing.

12:00.856 --> 12:02.875
Plus, you get to go
to all those fun stations.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.828
Eye test. Pop quiz. Photo shoot.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.537
I have never taken a better picture.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.428
The angle, the lighting.

12:10.453 --> 12:12.586
Walter took so much time.

12:15.039 --> 12:18.000
So, I'm handing my neighbor
her package. Apology, apology.

12:18.025 --> 12:19.641
And she's got this scowl on her face,

12:19.666 --> 12:21.023
and I'm thinking,
"That's a lot of attitude

12:21.054 --> 12:23.882
for somebody who orders
from Banana Republic."

12:24.171 --> 12:26.054
But turns out she's a dermatologist,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.496
and she's eying this
suspicious freckle on my arm.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.633
Get this. It was precancerous.

12:31.658 --> 12:33.862
Not procrastinating saved my life.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.939
Last night, I finally sat
down with Victor's message.

12:37.964 --> 12:40.548
And guess what. It was a butt-dial.

12:40.573 --> 12:42.504
Yeah. I listened to three minutes

12:42.529 --> 12:46.671
of him rustling around,
and then at the very end,

12:47.406 --> 12:50.902
I heard him ask his caregiver
to put him in a clean shirt

12:50.927 --> 12:53.234
so he'd look nice when I got home.

12:55.453 --> 12:57.459
Gonna keep that message forever.

12:57.692 --> 12:59.632
Well, this is a load of crap!

13:02.759 --> 13:05.894
I've been eating my hot dog
with just mustard my whole life,

13:05.919 --> 13:08.136
but therapy has opened me
up to trying new things.

13:08.161 --> 13:10.031
So if you're smelling
onions on my breath,

13:10.056 --> 13:11.723
it's really the smell of growth.

13:12.429 --> 13:13.641
That's fascinating.

13:13.727 --> 13:17.312
But what I asked you is,
"Did you sell the car?"

13:17.624 --> 13:19.157
All right, I didn't sell it yet,

13:19.182 --> 13:21.015
but only because I had a lot going on.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.328
I am busy, very busy.
I'm a very busy woman.

13:23.353 --> 13:25.019
Write that down. "Very busy woman."

13:25.437 --> 13:26.832
I think there's more to it than that.

13:26.857 --> 13:28.990
I think you're deeply
attached to your car,

13:29.015 --> 13:31.800
and you'll never get rid
of it unless you admit that.

13:31.825 --> 13:33.671
I'm gonna be honest with you, Trevor.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.750
The sweater vest is not
your most flattering look.

13:39.343 --> 13:41.930
I don't even like the car.
It's loud. It's unreliable.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.793
People are amazed it runs at all.

13:43.818 --> 13:45.517
Why would I have an emotional attachment

13:45.573 --> 13:47.039
to that hunk of junk?

13:47.093 --> 13:49.544
Because, on some level,
that hunk of junk is you.

13:49.569 --> 13:52.062
Geez, sorry about the vest comment.

13:52.692 --> 13:54.576
Classic transference.

13:55.014 --> 13:57.023
Still not what it means.

13:57.984 --> 13:59.421
We'll see.

14:00.437 --> 14:03.942
Bonnie, you have changed so
much over the last few years.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.977
You got sober, you're getting married,

14:06.002 --> 14:08.052
you're dealing with your ADD.

14:08.077 --> 14:10.437
That's a lot, and it's scary.

14:13.119 --> 14:16.265
Getting rid of that old car is
like getting rid of the old you.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.648
Or I was busy. You'd remember
that if you'd written it down.

14:20.632 --> 14:23.127
Okay, what's the first step we
need to take to sell the car?

14:23.625 --> 14:25.891
Put an ad on Craigslist, I guess.

14:25.916 --> 14:27.632
Great. Why don't you do that right now?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.134
I wish I could, but, uh, unfortunately,

14:30.170 --> 14:31.970
we are out of time.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.922
Only I get to say that.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.057
And if you're really seeing
a watch on your wrist,

14:36.082 --> 14:38.017
we've got bigger problems than your car.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.346
I don't want to do this right
now, okay? I just don't want to.

14:41.767 --> 14:44.159
You don't have to do it
alone. I'll be right here.

14:45.662 --> 14:48.296
I got to write a whole ad.
I can't do it on my phone.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.771
Well, why don't we use my laptop?

14:49.796 --> 14:52.470
"I'm Trevor. I have a vest
and a laptop."

14:59.058 --> 15:01.358
Patient files aren't on there.

15:01.595 --> 15:06.181
No, but a hilarious picture
of you riding a camel is.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.672
Okay, close that.

15:07.707 --> 15:08.756
And send.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.628
You win this round.

15:14.848 --> 15:16.014
And camels are scary.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.765
A lot of people make that face.

15:22.708 --> 15:23.853
Huh.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.863
Oh. Hey, hey, hey, Russell,
do you have a minute?

15:31.898 --> 15:34.282
No. I was just reading
through the brief.

15:34.307 --> 15:36.591
Well, your job is to
copy it, not to read it.

15:36.747 --> 15:39.381
Yes, and they are almost done.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.239
But-but I was just wondering

15:41.264 --> 15:43.481
why you didn't cite
Washington v. Shafer.

15:43.623 --> 15:46.591
That's because that case is, um...

15:48.248 --> 15:49.658
What's that case?

15:49.883 --> 15:52.717
Well, in a nutshell, the judge ruled

15:52.752 --> 15:54.969
prior criminal acts could be admissible

15:55.055 --> 15:57.672
if the similarity to the
current case provides the jury

15:57.757 --> 16:01.142
with a clearer understanding
of the evidence before them.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.163
Wow.

16:02.846 --> 16:05.980
That's a fantastic
idea, Christy. Great job.

16:06.005 --> 16:07.371
Seriously?

16:07.396 --> 16:10.046
Oh, my God, thank you.

16:12.366 --> 16:14.666
Guys, it just hit me in the bathroom.

16:14.691 --> 16:16.941
We should cite Washington v. Shafer.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.218
Lot of memories in this car.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.927
I'm really glad it's
going to such a nice kid.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.053
Thanks. It's perfect.

16:28.078 --> 16:30.038
Well, drive it in good health.

16:30.183 --> 16:31.733
Oh, I'm not gonna drive it.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.608
I'm gonna push it off a
cliff for my student film.

16:35.725 --> 16:36.928
What?

16:36.963 --> 16:38.796
Uh, it's his car now, Bonnie.

16:38.821 --> 16:41.693
But he's gonna murder
it. Uh, give me the keys.

16:41.718 --> 16:43.634
- No deal.
- What? Why?

16:43.659 --> 16:46.493
Just take your man bun
and go do some hot yoga.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.534
Dude, give her back the keys.

16:49.559 --> 16:51.275
It's only gonna get worse.

16:52.264 --> 16:54.562
Fine. I'll just use my dad's car.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.484
What the hell was that?

16:59.509 --> 17:01.880
Didn't you hear him? He was
gonna push me off a cliff.

17:01.905 --> 17:04.571
Okay, I'm used to a certain
level of Bonnie around here,

17:04.656 --> 17:06.991
but you're being even
Bonnier than usual.

17:07.077 --> 17:09.327
I guess, uh, it's possible

17:09.412 --> 17:12.880
I-I don't want the car to
end up in a ball of fire

17:12.905 --> 17:14.796
because I'm attached to it.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.656
That car kind of
represents who I used to be,

17:18.681 --> 17:22.890
and I'm... I'm having
trouble letting her go.

17:23.983 --> 17:25.619
Is that what Trevor says?

17:25.645 --> 17:27.428
Trevor and I don't talk about my car.

17:27.453 --> 17:29.407
We talk about you, and how you need

17:29.432 --> 17:32.016
to make more of an effort
in several different areas.

17:42.390 --> 17:45.554
Well, I don't know why, but I
think I might have tomato soup.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.667
I don't care what you say.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.919
My dermatologist neighbor's
now my new bestie,

17:51.944 --> 17:54.732
and I got a $1,200 peel for free.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.125
How long are you gonna look like that?

17:57.150 --> 17:59.521
Couple of days. Then it's
gonna get real crusty,

17:59.546 --> 18:01.262
then it's gonna start flaking off,

18:01.287 --> 18:03.615
but then I'm gonna look a
whole three months younger.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.701
Hey.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.271
Oof.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.888
Ah, great news.

18:10.913 --> 18:13.080
This guy stole my idea at work today.

18:13.544 --> 18:15.370
I've never actually had a job,

18:15.395 --> 18:17.779
but that does not sound like a win.

18:17.804 --> 18:19.707
I've only finished
one year of law school,

18:19.732 --> 18:21.816
and my ideas are already
good enough to steal

18:21.841 --> 18:23.474
by professional lawyers!

18:23.630 --> 18:25.341
So you're just gonna
let him get away with it?

18:25.366 --> 18:27.867
Yes. I am taking the high road.

18:28.035 --> 18:31.920
Also, revenge might be
seen as a micro-aggression.

18:32.105 --> 18:34.639
You came to that all on
your own? I'm impressed.

18:34.664 --> 18:36.330
Yeah, so am I.

18:36.355 --> 18:38.226
I guess that's what
happens if you stay sober.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.607
If it happened to me, I
would've broke into the guy's car

18:40.632 --> 18:42.516
and filled his trunk
full of rotting fish.

18:42.573 --> 18:44.356
Really? You'd do that?

18:44.381 --> 18:46.014
Yeah. If you want, I'll do it for you.

18:46.039 --> 18:48.756
I'd do it for any of you. I
got a fish guy and everything.

18:50.466 --> 18:52.763
- Hey, Tammy, you got a dollar?
- What?

18:52.788 --> 18:54.833
- Just give me a dollar.
- Okay.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.402
Congratulations. You just bought a car.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.604
What?

18:59.629 --> 19:01.068
I just sold you my old car.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.574
- Aw. - Are you serious? Bonnie,
why would you do that?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.743
Because I know you won't
push me off a cliff.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.287
You're right, I won't! Thank you!

19:09.036 --> 19:10.202
I'm gonna cry.

19:10.426 --> 19:13.344
I would, too, but I'm
afraid it would burn.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.786
The best part is I get
to go to my therapist

19:15.811 --> 19:17.302
and tell him to suck it.

19:18.715 --> 19:21.732
Just curious. What kind
of fish would you use?

19:25.873 --> 19:27.840
I'm pleased things worked
out with the car.

19:27.865 --> 19:29.248
Sounds like you found
the perfect place for it.

19:29.283 --> 19:32.001
I did. Thank you for pushing
me out of my comfort zone.

19:32.026 --> 19:34.063
I feel like I accomplished something.

19:34.088 --> 19:36.005
You did, and you should
be proud of yourself.

19:36.101 --> 19:37.767
Now you can take that momentum

19:37.792 --> 19:40.121
and use it on anything else
that you've been avoiding.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.354
I'll see you next week.

19:42.231 --> 19:44.755
There is one thing I've been putting off

19:44.780 --> 19:46.647
that I really
want to do.

19:46.672 --> 19:47.958
Hmm.

19:51.618 --> 19:54.849
Bonnie, this goes
against every ethical...

19:55.986 --> 19:57.620
Oh, screw it.

20:03.420 --> 20:06.568
Oh, that's transference.
