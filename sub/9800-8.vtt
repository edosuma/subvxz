00:20.142 --> 00:23.675
Ever get the feeling
somebody's watching your every move?

00:24.750 --> 00:27.357
- Our sincerest apologies, Skipper.
- Not you, soldier.

00:27.988 --> 00:29.236
Follow my lead.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.958
Kowalski, recon. What do you see?

00:36.083 --> 00:38.893
Not sure. The enemy must have
some sort of cloaking device.

00:39.354 --> 00:40.623
How about now?

00:42.626 --> 00:44.585
Yes, we are under surveillance.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.003
Evasive maneuvers!

00:55.110 --> 00:56.722
Still there, still watching.

00:57.101 --> 00:59.557
Impossible.
We used evasive maneuvers.

01:01.481 --> 01:02.477
<i>Yo, Alice.</i>

01:10.262 --> 01:11.396
I'm working here!

01:11.521 --> 01:13.572
<i>You done installing
those webcams or what?</i>

01:13.964 --> 01:17.326
Yes, but I still think
this whole Internet thing is stupid.

01:17.561 --> 01:19.734
Who wants to watch animals
on the computer?

01:19.859 --> 01:22.206
I want to watch animals
on the computer.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.811
Well, I want to watch me
on the computer, you know.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.752
What's a computer?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.115
I like computers.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.062
- So you know?
- No.

01:31.187 --> 01:33.836
But I don't have to know to like.

01:34.178 --> 01:38.022
A computer is a machine
the people use to avoid work,

01:38.339 --> 01:40.599
mainly by watching
silly little videos.

01:40.909 --> 01:44.353
You're saying those cameras are there
so the whole world can watch us?

01:44.646 --> 01:45.813
Like hawks.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.815
Except when they swoop down
and devour us.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.066
Hopefully.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.084
Don't you get it?

01:51.209 --> 01:53.057
They're trying
to get inside our heads,

01:53.182 --> 01:54.697
stealing our secrets.

01:54.865 --> 01:55.906
Wait, what?

01:56.385 --> 01:58.755
- Stealing our secrets!
- No, they're not.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.036
It's just for fun.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.790
They've gotten to you.
No one we can trust, boys.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.922
Tell me more about this
"people want to watch me" thing.

02:12.293 --> 02:15.296
They watch us online
and then vote for their favorite animal.

02:15.421 --> 02:19.263
Back at my old aquarium, I was...
I was the winner 3 years in a row.

02:19.431 --> 02:22.026
Which isn't very interesting to me,
because it isn't about me.

02:22.151 --> 02:23.225
See how it works?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.703
Maybe you didn't hear me.

02:25.987 --> 02:29.017
Three-time Internet popularity
contest winner

02:29.428 --> 02:30.579
right here.

02:31.443 --> 02:34.278
I can see me, but wider.

02:34.646 --> 02:36.697
I would like very much to have it.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.096
Well, since i'm out of competition,

02:39.221 --> 02:42.244
a scandal, long story,
I could help you if you want.

02:43.737 --> 02:44.997
Silly otter,

02:45.165 --> 02:47.083
I do not need
this thing called help.

02:47.741 --> 02:50.294
Whatever. If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.893
But I don't change my mind.
I have people for that.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.048
Here's the plan. We give them zip.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.097
Don't move a muscle.

03:01.540 --> 03:03.933
Skipper, I really need to...

03:04.184 --> 03:05.101
Go, go, go!

03:11.705 --> 03:13.234
Much better, thank you.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.283
Maurice, hit it.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.955
Over here, silly camera.

03:28.625 --> 03:32.169
I can feel my interweb
popularity skyrocketing.

03:33.436 --> 03:34.447
The egyptian.

03:34.753 --> 03:36.020
A sleeping bear.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.669
The angry sloth.

03:42.074 --> 03:44.516
Wait, what is the matter with you?
Look at me.

03:44.916 --> 03:47.643
Look at me.
Look at the angry sloth!

04:05.660 --> 04:07.651
Hold formation.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.126
Hold formation.

04:15.691 --> 04:18.923
Just a few more years of this,
and we're in the clear.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.427
I tell you, these webcams
aren't gonna catch on.

04:21.776 --> 04:23.679
The animals
don't do anything interesting.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.200
They just stand around.

04:26.793 --> 04:27.662
Oh, dear.

04:27.787 --> 04:30.311
- Stand strong, Private.
- Aye-aye, Skipper.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.775
Why don't you come
and hang out with us tasty,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.060
tasty, tasty fish?

04:39.389 --> 04:40.613
The tastiness.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.448
Rico, knock some sense into him.

04:43.456 --> 04:45.910
- Much better.
- I knew you'd listen to reason.

05:06.802 --> 05:08.068
We're surrounded.

05:08.849 --> 05:12.326
Hey, look, it's that funny penguin,
the one that slips.

05:12.784 --> 05:13.729
Hey, Slippy!

05:14.024 --> 05:15.099
Who's Slippy?

05:30.864 --> 05:32.206
Apparently, you're Slippy.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.458
I don't want to be Slippy.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.127
This is just sad.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.867
Where's the showmanship?

05:38.886 --> 05:41.966
Hello, Marlene,
what are you doing here?

05:42.493 --> 05:43.384
I live here.

05:43.552 --> 05:44.552
Really?

05:44.847 --> 05:46.053
Who knew? I didn't.

05:46.486 --> 05:48.217
Julien, you never visit...

05:48.801 --> 05:51.559
You must really be stinking up
the Internet.

05:52.546 --> 05:53.477
I mean, no.

05:53.646 --> 05:55.961
I could not be more popularest.

05:56.086 --> 05:58.566
Everybody loves the King that is me.

05:59.290 --> 06:01.527
Well, I guess I should
let you get back to it then.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.545
Well, yes, I guess.
Probably so, I'm very...

06:04.670 --> 06:05.828
They hate me.

06:05.953 --> 06:09.368
They hate me. I have to have
the pretty, shiny trophy.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.289
And that roly-poly penguin is hogging
all the glory that should be the King's.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.624
I need your help.
Please.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.377
Please. I'll say it
one more time, please.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.338
Okay, since you are
pathetically begging.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.216
I don't know if I'd say pathetic.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.653
- I would.
- Okay, it's just a word.

06:26.778 --> 06:28.656
- Help me now.
- Okay, here's what I see.

06:28.781 --> 06:32.533
Lights, music, artsy hats,
a performance that'll knock 'em dead.

06:33.703 --> 06:36.742
And if they are dead, they cannot vote
for that ridiculous penguin.

06:38.704 --> 06:41.564
Don't have much time.
Counterspying scenario, <i>s'il vous pla√Æt</i>.

06:42.806 --> 06:43.694
Outstanding.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.076
Blast, the enemy saw it.
We need another plan.

06:48.683 --> 06:50.449
Even better than the last one.

06:50.574 --> 06:52.495
Blast, the enemy saw this one too.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.664
Our little Internet star.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.263
Retreat, double time.

06:57.388 --> 06:58.292
Oh, dear.

06:58.672 --> 06:59.668
I'm captured!

07:03.436 --> 07:05.797
He's just a boy!

07:07.443 --> 07:08.761
Here you are, Slippy.

07:09.068 --> 07:10.387
Your own little stage.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.332
Slippy could get used to this.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.247
Topside slide, men, minus Private.

08:27.831 --> 08:31.135
Welcome to cirque du <i>So Great</i>.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.513
That's what we're going with?

08:34.638 --> 08:37.490
Yes, because it's awesome
just like me.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.280
Now hoist your King.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.995
I'm pretty sure this ain't
in my job description.

09:00.229 --> 09:01.753
Kowalski, camouflage.

09:08.053 --> 09:09.864
Rico, commence drilling, pronto.

09:12.343 --> 09:15.369
This routine is gonna
rock the house.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.563
I am a star!

09:33.301 --> 09:35.346
This madness ends now.

09:35.821 --> 09:37.368
Hello, Skipper. Care for a bite?

09:37.680 --> 09:38.702
We bust you out.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.261
Really?
Today may not work for me actually.

09:41.386 --> 09:43.697
Between the slipping and the falling,
I'm booked solid.

09:43.822 --> 09:45.172
Just as I feared.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.002
You've been brainwashed.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.921
I've been brainwashed?

09:49.134 --> 09:52.341
- Yes, you've been brainwashed.
- Brainwashed.

09:52.627 --> 09:54.510
You don't want your brain washed.

09:54.829 --> 09:56.971
I don't want my brain washed.

09:58.387 --> 09:59.598
Incoming!

10:21.417 --> 10:22.705
<i>On my jungle scene,</i>

10:23.386 --> 10:24.907
<i>he's the funk machine.</i>

10:25.330 --> 10:28.196
<i>When they play that groove,
he's got to move.</i>

10:35.721 --> 10:37.887
Good to have you back,
young Private.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.196
Although I do quite miss
the Slippy lifestyle.

10:40.321 --> 10:42.274
Still a little brainwashed, eh?

10:43.470 --> 10:44.393
Much better.

10:44.890 --> 10:46.854
I am not believing the people voted

10:47.022 --> 10:48.439
this most popularest.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.988
<i>Come on, dance to the rhythm now,
gonna dance to the rhythm now.</i>
