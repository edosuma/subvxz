WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:03.166
- Previously

00:03.166 --> 00:03.633
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:05.400 --> 00:08.767
- Oh, my effing God.
I'm on a private jet.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.533
- What's up, Solvang?

00:10.567 --> 00:12.400
- Sit down, sit down.
- No.

00:12.433 --> 00:14.500
Carter just ----ing
texted me from boys' night.

00:14.533 --> 00:16.266
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.600
- Wow, your girlfriend is being
an embarrassment.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.567
It's bad.
I don't even know where she is.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.467
- All right. I'll deal with it.
- He doesn't pay for anything.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.233
He doesn't pay rent.
He doesn't do anything.

00:24.266 --> 00:26.233
He literally does nothing.

00:26.266 --> 00:27.467
- We're all sitting here

00:27.500 --> 00:29.066
----ing talking
about having kids.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.033
I never thought
this would happen.

00:31.066 --> 00:32.767
- Is Ariana still very anti?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.333
- Is that a deal breaker
for you?

00:34.367 --> 00:37.100
- It is a deal breaker
for me with Ariana.

00:37.133 --> 00:40.333
- I just feel like Rand
and I are not the same.

00:40.367 --> 00:43.333
I decided to take
a break from him.

00:43.367 --> 00:45.333
both: You did?

00:45.367 --> 00:47.166
- Oh.

00:51.233 --> 00:54.567
- ♪ You know that
it's our time ♪

00:54.600 --> 00:59.500
♪ These are the best days
of our lives ♪

00:59.533 --> 01:03.433
♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:03.467 --> 01:07.500
♪ This one's for you tonight ♪

01:21.133 --> 01:23.600
- Yo, what's up?

01:23.633 --> 01:25.533
- Chilling, man.
What are you up to?

01:25.567 --> 01:28.166
- Just driving back
from the pool,

01:28.200 --> 01:30.166
you know, enjoying the day.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.500
Tomorrow I'm gonna go play
a bit of golf,

01:31.533 --> 01:33.367
if you're interested
in coming along.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.166
- Golf?

01:35.200 --> 01:37.166
- I remember in Mexico,
you were really good.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.600
- Yeah, I was so good at golf.

01:44.300 --> 01:48.433
- They're never gonna allow us
in Mexico again.

01:48.467 --> 01:50.166
- Yes!

01:50.200 --> 01:51.533
- I think Jax plays golf.

01:55.066 --> 01:56.333
- Okay.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.600
- Okay, cool.

01:58.633 --> 02:01.400
Um, I don't know
if you heard this or not,

02:01.433 --> 02:05.233
but I guess apparently Lala
and Randall broke up.

02:05.266 --> 02:07.066
- Oh, well,
that's not surprising.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.367
78-year-old boring,
fat Hollywood producer

02:10.400 --> 02:13.600
breaks up with 26-year-old
wannabe actress?

02:13.633 --> 02:16.200
Oh, no way. I'm so surprised
that didn't last.

02:16.233 --> 02:17.600
Tom, when me and Lala
were friends,

02:17.633 --> 02:19.500
she would be fighting
with Randall

02:19.533 --> 02:22.266
over the phone left and right.
Like, it was embarrassing.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.066
I wonder how Lala is gonna
stick to this breakup,

02:25.100 --> 02:27.567
you know, until Randall
pays back his actions in,

02:27.600 --> 02:31.433
let's say, 24 red roses
and a couple Chanel bags.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.433
- All right, dude.

02:34.467 --> 02:36.600
Well, I'll text you later
and just give you 100%,

02:36.633 --> 02:38.500
but, otherwise, I'm down.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.200
- All right, hasta luego.

02:40.233 --> 02:42.066
Oh, sh--.
All right, bye.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.467
- Hey, I got you, like,
four different kinds

02:53.500 --> 02:55.734
of ice cream,
strawberry-lemonade popsicles.

02:55.767 --> 02:58.233
We got Snickers bars.
Will that work?

02:58.266 --> 03:00.100
- Yeah, thanks.
- And vodka.

03:00.133 --> 03:01.667
- The vodka's for Lala.
- What's going on?

03:01.700 --> 03:03.533
- Well, she was crying
yesterday at the cookout.

03:03.567 --> 03:05.200
You know she never talks bad
about Randall,

03:05.233 --> 03:07.166
never says, like, a bad word.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.233
- I saw her upset, but I didn't
know what she was crying for.

03:08.266 --> 03:09.467
I didn't want to ask.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.700
- She was crying,
says they broke up.

03:10.734 --> 03:12.467
- So then she's done?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.367
- Yeah, it's not good.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.133
- My God, she's gonna have
to fly commercial.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.633
What is she gonna do?
- Hello?

03:17.667 --> 03:20.300
- I got the Tito's out.
- Hi.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.667
Oh, honey.

03:21.700 --> 03:26.533
Look at what I brought.
- Oh, yes.

03:26.567 --> 03:30.467
- For Lala.
She says this helps soothe her.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.467
- I turn on my favorite show,

03:32.500 --> 03:35.567
and then I prop it
up like this.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.367
- She probably needs a lot.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.433
Yeah, let's go sit down.

03:45.367 --> 03:46.667
- No sucking? Oh.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.667
- God, I made these
way too strong.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.633
- Yeah, Brit,
what the (BLEEP)?

03:50.667 --> 03:53.767
- Hi, baby. How are you?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.467
- Good, how are you?

03:55.500 --> 03:57.300
- We made you
alcohol-filled baby bottles.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.266
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

03:59.300 --> 04:01.567
- Very good.
I'm gonna let you girls talk.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.266
- It's actually
very strong so...

04:04.300 --> 04:06.467
- How are you?
- I'm good.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.433
- I've been thinking about you.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.467
- Well, it lasted
all of 17 hours.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.667
- What?

04:13.700 --> 04:15.500
- What happened?

04:15.533 --> 04:17.433
- I'm just an emotional person
right now.

04:17.467 --> 04:19.600
When I saw him, like,
living his best life

04:19.633 --> 04:21.633
after he's been harassing me
about if

04:21.667 --> 04:24.633
I've been drinking on the trip,
it's like, "(BLEEP) you."

04:24.667 --> 04:26.400
- But everything's okay?

04:26.433 --> 04:27.567
- Yeah, yesterday,
you were like, "It's done."

04:27.600 --> 04:29.433
- No, I was done.

04:29.467 --> 04:34.433
He did feel very badly,
and he took my Gucci slides.

04:34.467 --> 04:36.266
But then he gave them
back to me.

04:36.300 --> 04:39.300
- He gave them back?
- Humans (BLEEP) up sometimes.

04:39.333 --> 04:43.700
So if he and I can come
together in a moment of clarity

04:43.734 --> 04:46.000
and say that that's not
going to happen again

04:46.033 --> 04:49.633
and just recommit,
then I can let that go.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.300
But that was, like,
his little "I'm sorry.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.567
Here's your shoes back."

04:53.600 --> 04:55.533
And I got my Gucci slides back.

04:55.567 --> 04:57.000
- Where did Jax go?

05:01.400 --> 05:02.700
- He's probably in his room.

05:02.734 --> 05:04.600
It's basically
the fart closet in there.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.767
- I wasn't worried about it,

05:09.000 --> 05:10.533
but it crossed my mind
with the premiere.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.600
I was like, "Okay,
I know Randall produced it

05:12.633 --> 05:14.600
and you're in it, so it's not
like you both aren't gonna go."

05:14.633 --> 05:17.000
- No, I'll be there tomorrow.
Rand will be there tomorrow.

05:17.033 --> 05:21.333
I am starring in a film called
"The Row" which Rand produced.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.533
It's a small,
independent thriller.

05:23.567 --> 05:25.433
- Are you nervous
to see yourself

05:25.467 --> 05:28.500
on the big screen?
- Yes, I'm so nervous.

05:28.533 --> 05:31.367
I put a lot of time
and effort into my character

05:31.400 --> 05:33.266
and figuring out
how I can relate

05:33.300 --> 05:34.767
to someone who's a prude,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.667
and, you know,
that was a stretch for me.

05:37.700 --> 05:41.433
So then after the premiere,
I'm probably just gonna go

05:41.467 --> 05:44.533
with Rand to, like, celebrate,
just the two of us,

05:44.567 --> 05:47.266
'cause after the blowup,
I feel like maybe

05:47.300 --> 05:50.600
we should have just
a little--little alone time.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.433
- Oh, my gosh.

05:52.467 --> 05:53.667
- So you're saying you don't
wanna hang out with us.

06:02.700 --> 06:03.667
- Don't you think
the bottles look good?

06:03.700 --> 06:05.633
- Yeah.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.600
I think whatever we sell here,
the profit goes to the center.

06:08.633 --> 06:10.333
But, you know,
ultimately, it would be

06:10.367 --> 06:12.400
nice to kind of turn it
into a business.

06:12.433 --> 06:14.000
- The air conditioning
is what's up.

06:14.033 --> 06:15.333
- Yes.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.767
- Hello.
- Look at that. Hello.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.767
- How are you?
- How are you?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.567
- Good. How are you guys?
- Hi, guys.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.100
- Okay, so who's
being groomed then?

06:24.133 --> 06:26.000
- These two little girls.

06:26.033 --> 06:27.567
- That's gonna be a good one.
- He just needs a rinse

06:27.600 --> 06:29.367
'cause he actually
got groomed yesterday,

06:29.400 --> 06:30.567
but he rolled in a dead bird
or some sh--

06:30.600 --> 06:31.667
or something and he--

06:31.700 --> 06:33.533
- A dead bird?
- Yeah.

06:33.567 --> 06:34.667
- So what are you gonna
do to Refund?

06:34.700 --> 06:36.367
- Well, she's matted.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.266
- I want to see
her shorter, though.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.100
- Stassi wants to be the cutest
bitch on the block, right?

06:41.133 --> 06:43.500
- Beau has all these, like,
hipster-y vibes, and, like,

06:43.533 --> 06:46.000
he wants his dog
to look like a hipster.

06:46.033 --> 06:48.000
- Are we gonna stay here
while the doggies get groomed?

06:48.033 --> 06:50.600
- You're in very safe hands.
Yes, you are.

06:50.633 --> 06:52.000
- But she is a lady,

06:52.033 --> 06:54.033
and no lady
wants to look like that.

06:54.066 --> 06:55.600
- Who went on girls' trip?

06:55.633 --> 06:59.033
- So obviously Lala, me, Katie,
Kristen, Ariana,

06:59.066 --> 07:00.633
Scheana, Brittany.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.467
- And everybody had
a good time?

07:02.500 --> 07:05.533
- Everyone had a fantastic time
except for Kristen.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.734
- Why? What happened?
- Kristen turns into Satan

07:07.767 --> 07:09.433
when she's on vacation.

07:09.467 --> 07:10.667
She's struggling
in her relationship.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.667
She's kind of down
about things.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.367
- Well, I'm sorry that it's not
working out with Carter, truly,

07:15.400 --> 07:20.133
'cause I think he's been the
most stabling influence on her.

07:21.700 --> 07:26.667
- You know, I don't think...

07:28.600 --> 07:32.734
All Kristen tells me is
how unhappy she is with Carter,

07:32.767 --> 07:34.567
how he doesn't
treat her well at all.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.633
It's pretty much exactly
what it was like

07:36.667 --> 07:39.400
when I was with Patrick.
I complained about him nonstop

07:39.433 --> 07:41.100
but then didn't do
anything about it.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.600
The only difference really
is that, like,

07:43.633 --> 07:46.066
Kristen's a lot older than me.
She should know better.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.700
- Remember a few weeks ago,
you told us your mom was gonna

07:47.734 --> 07:50.100
come and do, like,
this tantric--no, not tantric.

07:50.133 --> 07:51.734
- No, no, no,
just relationship workshop.

07:51.767 --> 07:54.133
- She's coming in this week.
- She is coming?

07:54.166 --> 07:55.600
- And I'm meeting her
for the first time.

07:55.633 --> 07:56.734
- Okay.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.533
- My mom's a counselor.

07:58.567 --> 08:00.367
- We're gonna do, like,
a little mini workshop

08:00.400 --> 08:04.400
with all of us,
and she's going to help

08:04.433 --> 08:07.500
a lot of us
with our own relationships.

08:07.533 --> 08:12.333
I am so freaking lucky
to have found a guy like Beau

08:12.367 --> 08:15.367
who has been taught
and trained his whole life

08:15.400 --> 08:17.200
to deal with psychos like me.

08:17.233 --> 08:18.533
- Wait, wait,
what if your dark past

08:18.567 --> 08:20.767
surfaces when she's here?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.433
- Listen, if she's gonna be
my future mother-in-law,

08:23.467 --> 08:25.066
she's gonna have to see me
at my worst.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.600
- She's gonna be your
future mother-in-law?

08:26.633 --> 08:28.600
Is there something
I don't know?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.633
- No, no. She's just, like--
- We're not engaged.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.700
- No, not yet.
- Not yet?

08:32.734 --> 08:34.667
- Well, no. I'm just saying,
we've talked about a future.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.533
- So you're not jumping out
your chair.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.500
You're not, like,
running in the other direction.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.200
That means
you've talked about it.

08:40.233 --> 08:44.033
Stassi meeting Beau's mom
is a huge step.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.433
I remember when I first met
Ken's mother.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.066
I think I finally
got her approval.

08:48.100 --> 08:51.467
I think it took about,
you know, 25 years.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.000
Don't screw it up.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.767
- I'm trying really
hard not to.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.100
- So you're gonna go play golf?

08:57.133 --> 08:58.633
- I might, yeah.

08:58.667 --> 09:03.467
Dude, I was trying to work
on that application

09:03.500 --> 09:05.066
to get to the loan guy, Dana.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.700
- I don't have that.

09:06.734 --> 09:08.533
- I'm gonna forward this
to you right here.

09:08.567 --> 09:09.734
- Okay.

09:09.767 --> 09:12.033
I want to get out
of here so bad,

09:12.066 --> 09:14.000
but every time I think
about moving out of this place,

09:14.033 --> 09:17.633
I'm like, "Okay, so then I just
pay more rent to a landlord,"

09:17.667 --> 09:20.633
and that just goes down
the drain

09:20.667 --> 09:22.133
and I don't see
that money again.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.000
For a lot of my friends,

09:24.033 --> 09:26.700
growing up and being an adult
means getting engaged,

09:26.734 --> 09:29.133
having a fairytale wedding,
and having kids.

09:29.166 --> 09:32.133
For me,
it's the financial independence

09:32.166 --> 09:35.200
that comes from getting a house
and owning property.

09:35.233 --> 09:39.567
- I think it's important to me
that no matter what happens

09:39.600 --> 09:42.467
in our future, you know,
we should just make sure

09:42.500 --> 09:44.567
that we have enough bedrooms,
you know.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.200
I would, at some point,
want to have kids,

09:48.233 --> 09:51.467
whether it's adopt or whatever.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.133
- Sometimes I, like,
leave my headphones

09:53.166 --> 09:55.767
in because if Tom
starts to get on my nerves,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.233
I can just put on
some classical music

09:58.266 --> 10:00.500
and try to, like,
Zen out for a second

10:00.533 --> 10:03.533
and I won't feel like
I want to murder anyone.

10:03.567 --> 10:06.033
- I'd like to raise
a kid or kids...

10:08.000 --> 10:11.066
But, obviously, you see how
long it takes just getting...

10:17.033 --> 10:19.433
- But is that something that,
in the future,

10:19.467 --> 10:21.133
in the far, distant future,

10:21.166 --> 10:24.567
would you be maybe open
to considering?

10:24.600 --> 10:26.200
People have asked, whatever.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.233
- Oh, someone asked
you about it?

10:28.266 --> 10:30.133
- Jax brought it up.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.600
- Oh, boo-hoo.

10:31.633 --> 10:33.166
There's two things
that I know for sure:

10:33.200 --> 10:35.200
I don't want to have kids,
and I really,

10:35.233 --> 10:38.600
really want people
to stop asking me over and over

10:38.633 --> 10:39.734
if I want to have kids.

10:39.767 --> 10:41.200
- You don't ever
want kids, right?

10:41.233 --> 10:42.633
- Do you plan
on having children?

10:42.667 --> 10:44.000
- No.
- Yes.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.633
- How can you not want kids?

10:45.667 --> 10:48.567
- I don't really like babies.
I think they're kind of gross.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.567
Stay the (BLEEP)
out of my uterus.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.700
Asking you?
Please. It's ridiculous.

10:55.734 --> 10:58.567
- This kid subject is never
an easy thing

10:58.600 --> 11:00.233
to bring up with Ariana,

11:00.266 --> 11:02.700
but it's very fair for me
to ask these questions

11:02.734 --> 11:05.233
because we are planning
our future together.

11:05.266 --> 11:07.000
- It's nobody's business,

11:07.033 --> 11:09.333
but yet they keep
talking about it.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.100
- Coming up...

11:15.133 --> 11:16.767
- When you and Randall
started dating,

11:17.000 --> 11:18.767
how long did it take
for you guys to get serious?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.333
- I let him hit it
the first night,

11:20.367 --> 11:22.000
and I got a car the next day.

11:22.033 --> 11:24.100
He was like,
"Do you want a Range Rover?"

11:24.133 --> 11:25.734
I was like, "Yeah."

11:30.467 --> 11:31.300
- ♪ La, la, la-di-dah, di-dah,

11:31.300 --> 11:31.567
- ♪ La, la, la-di-dah, di-dah,
la-di-dah ♪

11:33.000 --> 11:34.767
♪ La, la ♪

11:35.000 --> 11:37.266

11:41.333 --> 11:45.667
- Hi, sexy.
- Hi. Hi.

11:45.700 --> 11:49.734
- I need a Tito's and soda
and a Diet Coke, please.

11:49.767 --> 11:52.734
- Tito's and soda and a rosé?
Tito's and soda?

11:52.767 --> 11:57.233
- Tito's and soda
and a Diet Coke.

11:57.266 --> 11:58.700
- Hello, ladies.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.100
- Hi.
- How are we doing?

12:00.133 --> 12:01.200
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

12:01.233 --> 12:02.767
Do you need a cocktail menu?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.367
- Sur restaurant.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.700
The lounge is actually
first-come, first-served.

12:07.734 --> 12:09.734
You're very welcome. Bye-bye.

12:12.367 --> 12:14.266
- What's wrong?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.266
It's intense.
- It's intense.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.433
- Over here--it's a lot crazier
over here than it is next door.

12:18.467 --> 12:20.266
- No, I like next door.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.767
I feel like it's so weird,
because tomorrow,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.367
I'm gonna walk the carpet
of a film that I'm, like,

12:25.400 --> 12:31.667
finally in and, like,
the lead of, and I'm excited,

12:31.700 --> 12:33.367
but I'm also sh---ing bricks.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.266
- You're a movie star.
- I'm trying to be.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.767
Like, I literally never
in a million years thought

12:39.000 --> 12:40.433
that I would be
in a horror film

12:40.467 --> 12:43.266
because I just--I don't think
I'm a great screamer.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.200
- Um, I've heard you scream.
- Like, during sex?

12:45.233 --> 12:48.266
- At other people.
- Oh, at people.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.500
- Hey, guys, can I get
the employee meal?

12:55.533 --> 12:57.500
Can I get crispy chicken?
Do you mind?

12:57.533 --> 12:59.667
Okay, thanks, guys.
I appreciate it. Thanks, Joe.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.333
- Can I get you

13:01.367 --> 13:03.266
any fresh cocktails
or anything at the moment?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.767
- Let me get it
out of your way.

13:07.734 --> 13:10.433
- Why is he calling?

13:10.467 --> 13:12.433
Hello?

13:12.467 --> 13:14.166
- Hey, Jax.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.133
- Hey, what's going on?

13:18.266 --> 13:20.533
- I'm in the back of Sur,
eating my dinner.

13:25.467 --> 13:29.433
- Um...okay, sure.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.300
James is clearly
not my friend,

13:31.333 --> 13:33.200
nor do I ever want to
be friends with this kid.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.333
- All right, sounds good.
Thanks for the invite.

13:39.033 --> 13:40.233
- Tom Sandoval
is friends with him.

13:40.266 --> 13:43.033
I like golf.
Green fees are expensive.

13:43.066 --> 13:44.200
So (BLEEP) it, why not?

13:46.066 --> 13:47.467
It's comical.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.166
- Listen, I started spinning.
- That's hard.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.734
- Well, I like things
that are quick and hard

13:59.767 --> 14:01.000
and then it's over.

14:01.033 --> 14:02.367
- Checking in?

14:02.400 --> 14:05.400
- We're here for Buddy.
Lala and Stassi.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.200
- You're gonna go right
over here, Lala, on this side.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.533
- Okay, I'll follow you, Jay.

14:08.567 --> 14:10.133
- Watch out, Austin.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.467
- Oh, I love girl time.
- So do I.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.000
- Dude, I can't believe
I have the premiere tonight.

14:15.033 --> 14:16.567
- I don't know anybody else
that has had--like,

14:16.600 --> 14:20.367
starred in a movie,
and it's my favorite genre...

14:20.400 --> 14:22.467
both: Horror.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.200
- Did you have fun
at Kristina's?

14:24.233 --> 14:26.066
- Yeah. Why, did you not?

14:26.100 --> 14:28.500
- Stuff just happened
with me and Rand. He ----ed up.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.300
- What did he do?

14:30.333 --> 14:31.500
- He didn't cheat
or anything like that.

14:31.533 --> 14:33.467
It was just--he had
a good time,

14:33.500 --> 14:36.233
and I felt like he a little
bit, like, betrayed my trust.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.500
So for the first time,
I'm like, "I'm ----ing done.

14:39.533 --> 14:41.033
Like, I'm over it."

14:41.066 --> 14:42.467
- Wait, I legitimately

14:42.500 --> 14:44.200
could not tell anything
was wrong with you.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.166
- Really? So he and I
are on a great track.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.600
We're back to normal.

14:47.633 --> 14:50.367
- We have, like,
400 million group chats.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.166
How did someone
not write this sh-- in?

14:53.200 --> 14:55.233
When you and Randall
started dating,

14:55.266 --> 14:58.300
how long did it take
for you guys to get serious?

14:58.333 --> 15:02.066
- So we met.
He came in to eat at Sur.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.133
They were having a meeting
about "The Row."

15:04.166 --> 15:06.133
I met him through "The Row."

15:06.166 --> 15:09.133
Rand saw me and sent
his assistant up to ask me

15:09.166 --> 15:11.333
if I was an actress.

15:11.367 --> 15:14.233
I told him to go
to my Instagram account.

15:14.266 --> 15:16.333
- That's her profile
picture on Instagram.

15:16.367 --> 15:19.500
- If your naked ass
is your profile picture,

15:19.533 --> 15:22.133
maybe you booked a job,
but it's probably not modeling.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.066
- The next day,
I get a phone call

15:24.100 --> 15:26.567
that says you have an audition.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.433
That's ----ing crazy.

15:28.467 --> 15:31.533
- I had auditioned for it,
and we went out, me and him,

15:31.567 --> 15:33.500
and, like, two of my friends,

15:33.533 --> 15:37.600
and I let him hit it the first
night, and we were inseparable.

15:37.633 --> 15:42.400
He would just send me, like,
really expensive gifts.

15:42.433 --> 15:45.467
The first night we banged,
I got a car the next day.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.200
He was like,
"Do you want a Range Rover?"

15:47.233 --> 15:49.133
I was like, "Yeah."

15:49.166 --> 15:52.333
- Is your vagina just, like,
made of sparkles?

15:52.367 --> 15:53.333
- I don't know.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.133
- Good for her.

15:55.166 --> 15:57.567
I've had, like, guys call me
an Uber the next morning,

15:57.600 --> 15:59.500
and I thought that was nice.

15:59.533 --> 16:01.333
- There have been a lot
of times where I'm like,

16:01.367 --> 16:03.533
"Come to a hotel,"
and I'll, like, put a wig on

16:03.567 --> 16:05.433
and I'll have him
meet me at the bar.

16:05.467 --> 16:08.367
I'll be named Tiffany,
and I'll do anything

16:08.400 --> 16:11.433
to be in a movie,
like, give blow jobs.

16:11.467 --> 16:13.166
Yeah, totally.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.433
- Shut the (BLEEP) up.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.133
- Like, when Rand
starts laughing

16:16.166 --> 16:18.066
and asks questions,
I'm just like,

16:18.100 --> 16:19.633
"Does Daddy want to play
with Lala's (BLEEP)?"

16:19.667 --> 16:22.066
- Oh, my God.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.166
- "Does Daddy want Lala to play
with your (BLEEP)?"

16:27.567 --> 16:29.066
- Coming up...

16:29.100 --> 16:30.266
- You're not happy.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.200
You don't sleep
in the same bed.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.066
You don't have sex. He's mean
to you all the ----ing time.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.567
- He's not your ----ing
boyfriend,

16:35.600 --> 16:37.266
so don't tell me
what he needs to be doing.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.400
- Thank God
he's not my boyfriend.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.734
- All right, man, let's golf.

16:50.767 --> 16:53.166
- I'm, like, the best
golf cart driver ever.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.734
- All right, who's up?

16:59.767 --> 17:01.767
- Jax, I got you a glove, bro.
Are you left-handed?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.567
- Thank you. Yes, I am.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.767
James is just desperate
to fit in, you know,

17:06.000 --> 17:07.533
obviously trying to get
on my good side.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.533
Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:09.567 --> 17:10.567
- It is what it is.

17:10.600 --> 17:11.600
- All right, I'm gonna go.

17:11.633 --> 17:13.400
(BLEEP) it.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.533
Oh, no.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.367
That's nice.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.533
- Whoo! Not bad, mate.
That's good.

17:21.567 --> 17:23.533
- Oh, no. Come on, Tom.
We got to go, dude.

17:23.567 --> 17:24.734
- Chill, brah.

17:24.767 --> 17:26.333
- James, I got you
a ginger ale.

17:26.367 --> 17:27.433
You want ginger ale?

17:27.467 --> 17:29.400
- Oh, my God,
----ing thank you.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.400
I'm on a very rocky road right
now when it comes to Lisa,

17:31.433 --> 17:33.400
when it comes to Sur.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.433
- Well, you really knocked
the crap out of that one.

17:35.467 --> 17:37.433
- Lisa said I couldn't get
my job back

17:37.467 --> 17:40.367
until I took some tangible
steps into bettering myself.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.433
(BLEEP).

17:42.467 --> 17:44.567
I don't even like
golf that much but, you know,

17:44.600 --> 17:46.734
anything for these guys
to go back and tell Lisa

17:46.767 --> 17:51.266
that I'm making good decisions.
I'd say that's pretty tangible.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.533
- Oh, it's too hard, too hard.
Get in there. Oh!

17:53.567 --> 17:56.233
- So Ariana and I are looking
at houses right now.

17:56.266 --> 17:57.767
We have--we're on
a two-week deadline

17:58.000 --> 18:01.200
to basically get everything
completely figured out.

18:01.233 --> 18:03.333
You know, I just want to say,

18:03.367 --> 18:05.333
I know that this has
kind of been a little bit

18:05.367 --> 18:08.300
of a subject lately
about, like, us with kids.

18:08.333 --> 18:12.400
I would really appreciate it if
you guys didn't bring that up.

18:12.433 --> 18:15.300
- To who, you?
- To me, to Ariana.

18:15.333 --> 18:19.400
- I want kids. I'll probably
have kids before all of you.

18:19.433 --> 18:20.600
- It's just
the giving birth thing

18:20.633 --> 18:22.600
really kind of freaks her out,

18:22.633 --> 18:25.266
and I understand that because
it's not something I can do.

18:25.300 --> 18:29.500
If I could do it,
I would ----ing do it.

18:29.533 --> 18:31.567
It's not a hard no,
but when people

18:31.600 --> 18:34.233
ask her--if you ask her,
if Brittany asks her,

18:34.266 --> 18:36.767
if you ask her,
if anybody asks her,

18:37.000 --> 18:38.767
she's gonna say,
"(BLEEP) no, never."

18:39.000 --> 18:40.567
- So let me get this straight:

18:40.600 --> 18:42.033
so if I weren't asking
so many questions,

18:42.066 --> 18:43.533
you're gonna tell me

18:43.567 --> 18:44.734
that Ariana
would be in a house right now

18:44.767 --> 18:46.300
pumping out kids
left and right?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.767
I don't think so.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.567
- Just don't ask her about it.
- I was actually gonna

18:50.600 --> 18:52.700
go have lunch with her
right now and say,

18:52.734 --> 18:54.734
"Hey, let's have
a full conversation on kids."

18:54.767 --> 18:56.400
- Every time Katie
brought it up,

18:56.433 --> 18:57.500
I was, like--it pushed me
farther away,

18:57.533 --> 18:59.000
until she gave me an ultimatum,

18:59.033 --> 19:00.567
which I think you should
do to Ariana.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.033
- You've got
to be ----ing kidding me.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.066
- I'm kidding, dude.
I'm kidding.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.767
Listen, I'm not kidding.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.567
Those ultimatums,
they're effective.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.667
They get sh-- done.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.600
Let's go golf.
- Let's go golf.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.066
- I like it too.
- Let's do it.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.233
- This ball
says super straight.

19:14.266 --> 19:16.367
- It's overcompensating
for something.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.500
- ♪ Spotlight
and I'm ready to go ♪

19:21.533 --> 19:23.700
♪ All eyes on me ♪

19:26.367 --> 19:27.500
♪ Dim the lights ♪

19:27.533 --> 19:29.000
♪ Gonna get on the show ♪

19:29.033 --> 19:32.533
♪ I'm shining, baby ♪

19:32.567 --> 19:36.033
- Oh, yeah, this is our spot.

19:36.066 --> 19:38.400
- This is cute.

19:38.433 --> 19:40.333
- Ladies, welcome
to Lock & Key.

19:40.367 --> 19:42.000
- Okay, you guys, can we
just for a second talk

19:42.033 --> 19:44.400
about how ----ing awesome
Lala was in the movie?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.400
- Yes.
- I'm so excited.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.266
- Okay, let's go sit down.
- Yes.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.633
Lala, let's go watch you,
like, murder people.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.300
Lala was the best part
of that entire movie.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.567
- One hundred percent.
- Lala's movie "The Row" is

19:55.600 --> 19:59.700
about a bunch of sorority
bitches getting slashed.

19:59.734 --> 20:04.567
The genre's, like,
college slasher hot girl.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.633
Can that be a genre?

20:06.667 --> 20:08.600
- I'm so excited for you
to meet Beau's mom.

20:08.633 --> 20:10.700
- Y'all are all gonna meet
Beau's mom.

20:10.734 --> 20:14.100
Kristen is gonna be hosting.
Beau's mom is coming over,

20:14.133 --> 20:16.533
and it would be a big fail
if the mother-in-law

20:16.567 --> 20:20.300
that I dreamt up in my head
didn't like me.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.567
I've never met Beau's mom,
except for FaceTime,

20:22.600 --> 20:25.333
and I'm finally gonna be able
to meet her in person.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.600
I am so ----ing
nervous right now.

20:27.633 --> 20:31.300
Air out my pits. Thank you.

20:31.333 --> 20:32.700
Like, my boobs are sweating.

20:32.734 --> 20:35.433
Like, the sweat from my boobs
are sweating.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.500
She loves to just
talk to people

20:38.533 --> 20:40.433
just about their relationships,

20:40.467 --> 20:44.033
and just I want both you and
Carter to be open and honest.

20:44.066 --> 20:46.700
- I am honest, and I don't
bullsh-- you guys.

20:46.734 --> 20:48.734
- How are things?

20:48.767 --> 20:51.533
- Day-to-day life
is so much better

20:51.567 --> 20:55.033
and more positive
than it has been.

20:55.066 --> 20:57.166
- What--what changed?
What inspired?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.667
- Financially,
it is so wonderful.

20:59.700 --> 21:03.066
He is carrying
his weight financially,

21:03.100 --> 21:05.066
which makes me happy.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.100
- As of even very recently,

21:07.133 --> 21:10.533
Kristen has vented
that she's not happy.

21:10.567 --> 21:13.433
- I'm sick of fighting.
I'm just--I'm tired.

21:13.467 --> 21:14.734
I'm so tired of it.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.133
I'm just--I'm not
----ing happy.

21:17.166 --> 21:20.133
- And then now, as if, like,
some miracle happened

21:20.166 --> 21:22.133
overnight,
everything is wonderful.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.166
- Every time I ask you
about this

21:24.200 --> 21:26.400
in a group situation, you say,

21:26.433 --> 21:28.333
"Well, yesterday
was a good day."

21:28.367 --> 21:30.066
But if it's not
a group situation, it was,

21:30.100 --> 21:32.000
"Yesterday was the worst day."

21:32.033 --> 21:34.000
- You've been in a relationship
that changed for the better.

21:34.033 --> 21:36.066
- Change is amazing.
Change is awesome.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.567
I think that we just want to
make sure you're being honest.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.400
- I am being
very ----ing honest.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.433
- Right now, you're acting
like you're hiding things.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.033
- I am not hiding anything.

21:44.066 --> 21:45.767
Like, for Friday,
he was, like, prepping,

21:46.000 --> 21:47.567
so I don't have to do
anything tomorrow.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.066
He's making
a grocery shopping list.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.533
- Literally...

21:53.567 --> 21:54.667
- That's a good point, though.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.500
- A while back,

21:56.533 --> 21:59.066
Carter went on vacation,
and he took her entire wallet.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.033
Like, she didn't have her
ID or anything.

22:01.066 --> 22:02.734
He's used her card a lot.

22:02.767 --> 22:04.100
- You just said it
in a bitchy way.

22:04.133 --> 22:05.633
It was, like, so boring.

22:05.667 --> 22:08.100
- Yeah, it is boring.
It is boring hearing him

22:08.133 --> 22:10.633
use your money,
spend your money all the time.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.000
That's really ----ing
boring to me.

22:13.033 --> 22:16.533
(BLEEP) yeah.

22:16.567 --> 22:21.133
Wake up. I love you.

22:21.166 --> 22:22.633
You're not happy.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.567
You don't sleep
in the same bed.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.233
You don't have sex. He's mean
to you all the ----ing time.

22:26.266 --> 22:29.400
So sh--'s been good
for a month, supposedly.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.400
I don't believe it.
You don't believe it.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.166
- Don't make generalizations
about my relationship.

22:33.200 --> 22:37.033
If I ever get married,
it's going to be to Carter.

22:37.066 --> 22:40.467
I'm getting old, and I don't
want to be miserable and alone,

22:40.500 --> 22:43.200
so I really need
the support of my friends.

22:43.233 --> 22:45.100
He's not your ----ing
boyfriend,

22:45.133 --> 22:46.567
so don't tell me
what he needs to be doing.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.066
- Thank God he's not
my boyfriend,

22:48.100 --> 22:49.133
'cause I wouldn't stand
for that sh--.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.433
- All right.

22:50.467 --> 22:52.734
- Get the (BLEEP) out now.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.467
- I'm gonna grab a beer.

23:00.033 --> 23:01.166
- Coming up...

23:01.200 --> 23:02.734
- Just throwing it
out there,

23:02.767 --> 23:04.066
but if you're gonna get
a house with somebody,

23:04.100 --> 23:05.533
make sure
you're on the same page.

23:05.567 --> 23:07.033
- Well, I'm buying that
----ing house,

23:07.066 --> 23:09.200
and if he wants to leave,
he can buy me out,

23:09.233 --> 23:10.600
and I'll stay there.

23:23.333 --> 23:24.734
- How are we doing today?
- Good, good.

23:24.767 --> 23:26.467
- Awesome, we've got
a beautiful day.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.734
Can I get you started
with anything to drink?

23:27.767 --> 23:29.300
- I think tequila
is what he wants.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.633
- Oh, hey.

23:36.667 --> 23:39.133
- Oh, my gosh. Hey.

23:39.166 --> 23:42.333
- We're matching.
- Yeah.

23:42.367 --> 23:44.533
- In your hat,
you look really chic.

23:44.567 --> 23:46.033
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

23:46.066 --> 23:47.667
This is crazy.

23:47.700 --> 23:51.266
This is the woman that could be
my future mother-in-law.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.700
I have this for you.

23:52.734 --> 23:55.600
- Thank you.
That is so thoughtful.

23:55.633 --> 23:59.233
- Like, I feel like this is,
like, my wedding day.

23:59.266 --> 24:00.333
Is that creepy?

24:00.367 --> 24:01.700
- Ah.

24:01.734 --> 24:04.500
- I'm so glad that you're here.

24:04.533 --> 24:07.133
He is the way
he is because of you so...

24:07.166 --> 24:10.533
My closest, best friends,
they kept telling me about him,

24:10.567 --> 24:16.333
and he looked at my Instagram
and said no.

24:16.367 --> 24:19.100
- So, obviously,
you're beautiful,

24:19.133 --> 24:23.100
so that does not move him,
physical attractiveness.

24:23.133 --> 24:28.266
What moves him is, obviously,
your personality, who you are.

24:28.300 --> 24:32.200
That's a compliment, you know,
looking at a picture

24:32.233 --> 24:35.367
and saying no.
That's not what he's about.

24:35.400 --> 24:38.767
- She's also the first person--
girl--that I was like,

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
"Oh, this is my best friend."

24:40.033 --> 24:41.600
- You've never told me that.

24:41.633 --> 24:43.633
- If I were to tell you that,
then you're like,

24:43.667 --> 24:45.367
"Oh, it's just 'cause
you're trying to tell me that."

24:45.400 --> 24:49.100
Like, no, you literally--
you're my best friend.

24:49.133 --> 24:50.600
Can I ask you guys something?

24:50.633 --> 24:51.633
- What?
- I really have to pee.

24:51.667 --> 24:52.767
- Okay.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.767
- Can you please, please,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.667
please not embarrass me
while I'm gone?

24:57.700 --> 24:59.700
- But you won't be here.
- I'm sorry.

24:59.734 --> 25:02.300
I'm just gonna turn my audio
on my phone on voice record

25:02.333 --> 25:06.166
and leave it here.
Please.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.367
- Oh, that reminds me of
the story when you were little

25:08.400 --> 25:11.033
and you kept having that drip
in your underwear.

25:11.066 --> 25:13.400
I had to ask somebody
'cause I was a single parent.

25:13.433 --> 25:16.300
I didn't know, and he told me,
"Tell him to shake it."

25:16.333 --> 25:20.300
- That was a real story.
- That's a real story.

25:20.333 --> 25:23.333
- I love him very much, and I
was really scared to meet you

25:23.367 --> 25:25.700
because it matters, like,
that much more.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.333
- I love him,

25:32.367 --> 25:37.667
and I'm very happy
that he's with you.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.066
- Thanks.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.367
- He really loves you.
- I know.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.734
- And I know that I'm a mother,
but it's, like, I want to go,

25:44.767 --> 25:48.066
"Don't hurt him."
He really loves you.

25:48.100 --> 25:53.333
He cares about
who the person is, you know,

25:53.367 --> 25:56.734
and I just think
he was born that way.

25:56.767 --> 25:58.333
- So I haven't listened
to this yet,

25:58.367 --> 26:01.333
but this is what I recorded
when I left.

26:01.367 --> 26:03.266
- I really hope that
it's not freaky

26:03.300 --> 26:06.033
when I say that I hope you're
my future mother-in-law.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.600
- Are you kidding me?

26:07.633 --> 26:10.367
I love that.
I feel the same way, Stassi.

26:10.400 --> 26:15.033
- I love Beau so much,
so ----ing much.

26:15.066 --> 26:16.734
- And I just thank you.

26:16.767 --> 26:20.600
Thank you for loving my son
like that, you know.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.200
- Yeah, I think it went
well between them.

26:25.233 --> 26:26.767
- Well, I'm gonna tell you
that you are a huge part

26:27.000 --> 26:29.233
of the reason
why he is the way that he is.

26:29.266 --> 26:32.100
- Well, I appreciate that.
Thank you. But you're wrong.

26:52.066 --> 26:54.433
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

26:54.467 --> 26:56.734
I'm gonna bring you guys
some fresh glasses out, okay?

27:01.100 --> 27:02.400
- Thank you.

27:02.433 --> 27:04.333
- Yeah.

27:07.266 --> 27:08.734
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:08.767 --> 27:10.400
- I had, like, three parties
in my section.

27:10.433 --> 27:11.767
- Really?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.500
- Three birthday parties.
- Oh.

27:13.533 --> 27:16.700
I was like, "Three parties?"
That's a busy section.

27:16.734 --> 27:20.066
- And it's past 10:00,
so I am no longer

27:20.100 --> 27:22.667
allowed to have anything
to drink or eat for my surgery.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.133
I'm getting all four
of my wisdom teeth pulled.

27:25.166 --> 27:28.000
The last surgery that
I had done was my boob job,

27:28.033 --> 27:30.700
and Jax didn't take care of me
as well as he could have.

27:30.734 --> 27:33.667
- That's the worst.
- It sucks.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.700
But now that we're engaged,
he better take care of me

27:36.734 --> 27:38.700
no questions asked,
hand and foot,

27:38.734 --> 27:40.433
through sickness
and through health.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.133
If I do drink
a little bit of water,

27:43.166 --> 27:44.400
what's gonna happen to me?

27:44.433 --> 27:45.533
- No, when you go under
anesthesia, like,

27:45.567 --> 27:46.734
they don't want you to, like--

27:46.767 --> 27:48.433
- Pee myself?

27:50.467 --> 27:52.033
- Hey.

27:52.066 --> 27:53.367
- What's up, man?
- What's up, dude?

27:53.400 --> 27:56.066
What's going on?
Good to see you.

27:56.100 --> 27:58.166
Whoa, what's up, dude?
What's going on?

28:02.233 --> 28:04.300
- What are you doing here?
- Where you been all my life?

28:04.333 --> 28:06.166
- So what's happening?

28:06.200 --> 28:09.734
What's happening with
the stupid term sheet, okay?

28:09.767 --> 28:11.500
- Well, our lawyer
was out of town,

28:11.533 --> 28:13.033
so we just
wanted them to, like--

28:13.066 --> 28:14.367
- Our lawyer.
- Yeah.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.166
- They kept going on and on
and on about it,

28:16.200 --> 28:17.700
so I gave them the term sheet.

28:17.734 --> 28:19.333
Listen.

28:19.367 --> 28:21.500
- What's that, money?
- It's a termed agreement.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.000
I never want
to do anything in writing.

28:25.033 --> 28:27.233
If you want this,
then you can have it.

28:27.266 --> 28:29.333
The TomTom opening
is in ten days.

28:29.367 --> 28:31.266
I can't really open the bar,
put the sign up,

28:31.300 --> 28:34.467
and call it TomTom
if they're not 100% on board.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.233
So you've got to hurry up,
guys, because, you know,

28:37.266 --> 28:38.533
JaxJames is looking
really good right now.

28:51.100 --> 28:54.467
- All right, sweet pea. Ready?

28:56.233 --> 28:59.467
- You all right?
You okay?

28:59.500 --> 29:01.333
- Yeah.
- All right, hold onto me.

29:01.367 --> 29:03.133
Hold on.

29:03.166 --> 29:04.467
I've never had
my wisdom teeth pulled out,

29:04.500 --> 29:07.233
but I know it's
a pretty painful surgery.

29:13.633 --> 29:15.166
- You're putting lip gloss?

29:15.200 --> 29:18.166
- I got you.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.233
In the past, I've always been
in relationships that were,

29:20.266 --> 29:22.066
like, just going nowhere,

29:22.100 --> 29:23.400
and I never really wanted
to take care of them.

29:23.433 --> 29:25.100
"Do not rinse the mouth

29:25.133 --> 29:26.500
for at least 12 hours
following surgery."

29:26.533 --> 29:28.400
With Brittany, obviously,
things are different.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.467
I love her.
She's my best friend.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.100
I love taking care of her.

29:32.133 --> 29:33.266
You need to take
the antibiotics first.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.567
- Okay.
- I enjoy it.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.166
I almost get off
on taking care of her.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.200
Okay, so that's there.
Your phone is here.

29:39.233 --> 29:41.066
Give me five minutes.
I'll be right back.

29:42.367 --> 29:43.533
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:43.567 --> 29:45.200
- Yo, what's up, dude?
- Hey.

29:45.233 --> 29:47.100
- Hi, sorry. What's up, man?
- Hey.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.533
- How's Brit?
- Hi.

29:49.567 --> 29:51.266
I'm just gonna pop up there

29:51.300 --> 29:52.567
and give her a hug
and come back down.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.467
- Yeah, she's kind of out
of it, though.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.600
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
say hey real quick.

29:57.633 --> 29:59.166
Oh. Oh.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.233
Shh.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.633
I love you, babe.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.300
- I love you.
- I brought you some popsicles.

30:05.333 --> 30:07.300
I'm gonna stick them
in the freezer for you.

30:07.333 --> 30:11.600
This little one is a little bit
too hyped, I feel like,

30:11.633 --> 30:13.533
to be playing nurse.
How's it going?

30:13.567 --> 30:15.200
- So you're coming
to Kristen's for the--

30:15.233 --> 30:17.100
- Yeah.

30:17.133 --> 30:18.567
Are you coming, or are you
gonna stay here with Brittany?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.000
- I just don't think
it's a good idea

30:20.033 --> 30:21.367
that I come, like, this soon.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.433
I just don't want
to leave her alone.

30:22.467 --> 30:24.166
She can't even drink water.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.133
- No, I totally agree.
- Hey, I just want to say

30:26.166 --> 30:27.533
I'm sorry for all that crap.
I feel really bad.

30:27.567 --> 30:29.133
It was a simple question
about having kids.

30:30.467 --> 30:32.266
- We're not supposed
to talk about that.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.433
- It was just--we were at
Tom's birthday, right,

30:34.467 --> 30:36.567
and we were just talking about
the next chapters of our life.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.300
It's a normal question.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.333
I was like, "You know,
you plan on having kids?"

30:40.367 --> 30:42.367
Yadda, yadda.
He was like, "Yeah."

30:42.400 --> 30:44.066
And I was like, "Okay."

30:44.100 --> 30:45.433
- Thanks, Jax Taylor.

30:45.467 --> 30:49.066
I love how he apologized
for bringing up kids

30:49.100 --> 30:51.500
and then proceeded
to talk about kids.

30:51.533 --> 30:53.333
If you're gonna get
a house with somebody,

30:53.367 --> 30:55.266
that pretty much says
you're gonna spend

30:55.300 --> 30:56.667
the rest of your life together.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.433
For me, Brittany and I
talked about this

30:58.467 --> 31:01.600
before we got engaged,
before we started dating,

31:01.633 --> 31:03.400
just so we were
on the same page.

31:03.433 --> 31:05.567
- Oh, now all of a sudden
Jax ----ing Taylor

31:05.600 --> 31:08.567
is the authority
on relationships

31:08.600 --> 31:10.500
and being on the same page.

31:10.533 --> 31:12.567
- That was the only point,
nothing more, nothing less.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.100
- Pull your head out
of my vagina

31:15.133 --> 31:16.367
and worry about yourself.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.300
Well, I'm buying that
----ing house,

31:18.333 --> 31:20.500
and if he wants to leave,
he can buy me out

31:20.533 --> 31:21.567
and I'll stay there.

31:24.533 --> 31:26.333
- Coming up...

31:26.367 --> 31:28.200
- You know why she comes home
and we get in fights?

31:28.233 --> 31:30.200
It's because you guys are
----ing dicks to her.

31:30.233 --> 31:32.166
- All right, bye.
- You guys are ----ing rude.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.266
- Carter, all she wants is you
to be ----ing nice to her.

31:45.500 --> 31:49.500
- ♪ Next level ♪

31:49.533 --> 31:53.333
♪ Go and... ♪

31:53.367 --> 31:54.700
- What else do we need to do?
- Nothing.

31:54.734 --> 31:56.700
- I think we're good.
We got ice. We got booze.

31:56.734 --> 31:59.300
- I hate when you say "booze."
It's so trashy.

31:59.333 --> 32:02.200
It'll be fun, though.
I'm excited for Beau's mom.

32:02.233 --> 32:04.400
Beau's mom decided that
she was willing to do

32:04.433 --> 32:06.433
a relationship
workshop for us,

32:06.467 --> 32:10.533
so I opened up my home
and invited all of my friends.

32:10.567 --> 32:13.567
- We should've got, like,
stadium seating.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.300
- Just stick the assholes
in the back.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.500
- Well, that would be
all of it.

32:16.533 --> 32:17.700
That'd be everybody.

32:17.734 --> 32:20.667
- Not everybody.
- Katie and Stassi.

32:20.700 --> 32:24.734
- Considering my relationship
is rocky and under attack

32:24.767 --> 32:28.767
by said friends,
the irony is not lost on me.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Where do you want to sit,
front and center?

32:31.033 --> 32:32.700
- At the bar down the street.

32:36.600 --> 32:37.667
- I'm very excited.

32:37.700 --> 32:39.233
- Hey. Those are some pants.

32:39.266 --> 32:40.367
- Where's the ice?

32:40.400 --> 32:41.567
- Hello?
- Hey, girl.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.700
- Hi, guys.

32:46.066 --> 32:48.400
- Hi.
- Hello. Welcome.

32:48.433 --> 32:51.500
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

32:54.734 --> 32:56.266
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.600
- Hi, Kristen.

32:58.633 --> 32:59.734
- This is my mom.
- Hi, Kristen.

32:59.767 --> 33:01.433
- Hi, Beau.

33:01.467 --> 33:02.433
- It's so nice
to meet you, finally.

33:02.467 --> 33:04.266
- Isa. Nice to meet you.

33:04.300 --> 33:05.767
- Beau, is this your mom?
- That's my mom.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.233
- Group workshops
are just a thing

33:07.266 --> 33:08.734
that Beau's mom loves to do,

33:08.767 --> 33:10.467
and she's done these workshops
all over the place.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.200
- I'm gonna teach today
what's happening

33:13.233 --> 33:15.033
when we're
emotionally triggered.

33:15.066 --> 33:17.333
- Ooh, can we have shots first?

33:17.367 --> 33:19.333
- Maybe we should do
some shots.

33:19.367 --> 33:20.633
She doesn't charge any money.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.400
She just believes
in helping people

33:22.433 --> 33:23.667
with their
relationship problems...

33:23.700 --> 33:26.500
Is everyone liquored up
right now?

33:26.533 --> 33:28.300
- On the way.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.600
- Which works out because
my friends have a sh-- ton.

33:30.633 --> 33:34.467
- Normally--this is, like,
professional and personal,

33:34.500 --> 33:36.633
and normally
when I've come to visit,

33:36.667 --> 33:39.667
people just ask me questions
about relationships

33:39.700 --> 33:42.567
and I answer,
but this time, I just thought,

33:42.600 --> 33:45.734
"Well, you know what, I'm just
gonna teach you all something

33:45.767 --> 33:48.533
that you can apply yourselves
in your own lives."

33:48.567 --> 33:52.066
What I learned about
the reptilian brain

33:52.100 --> 33:54.567
is that it's the old,
primal part of the brain.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.767
When we are
emotionally triggered,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.300
the reptilian brain
is activated,

34:00.333 --> 34:04.767
which means the part of our
brain that solves problems,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.734
right, is no longer connected.

34:07.767 --> 34:11.667
The only question that the
reptilian brain has to look at

34:11.700 --> 34:14.734
is who lives and who dies.
That's it.

34:14.767 --> 34:17.266
- The reptilian brain.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.400
I wonder if that's all
I have left right now,

34:19.433 --> 34:22.500
'cause I have been
acting crazy as (BLEEP).

34:22.533 --> 34:24.000
We're bonding over the fact

34:24.033 --> 34:25.600
that my dad died,
you ----ing twat.

34:25.633 --> 34:28.033
- When you argue in
the reptilian brain,

34:28.066 --> 34:30.767
it's like "Alien vs. Predator,"

34:31.000 --> 34:34.300
because there is no potential
for compromise.

34:34.333 --> 34:38.266
- Maybe it was my reptilian
brain that wanted to stab Jax

34:38.300 --> 34:41.033
for talking about me
not wanting to have kids.

34:41.066 --> 34:42.333
- The point I was trying
to make is,

34:42.367 --> 34:43.700
before you buy a house,

34:43.734 --> 34:45.133
make sure you're
on the same page.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.333
- I still want to stab
Jax, though.

34:47.367 --> 34:50.734
- I'm emotionally triggered,
and I like it, you know.

34:50.767 --> 34:53.467
- Isa is right.
I have something inside of me

34:53.500 --> 34:57.400
that forces me to lash out
and act crazy.

34:57.433 --> 34:59.300
Get the (BLEEP)
out of my face now!

34:59.333 --> 35:00.767
- Ow! What
the (BLEEP) you--

35:01.000 --> 35:02.700
- I never knew that it was
my reptilian brain.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.033
I just always thought
it was my brain.

35:05.066 --> 35:06.567
- So this is the safety plan:

35:06.600 --> 35:08.567
recognize
when you are triggered

35:08.600 --> 35:11.300
or when your significant other
is triggered

35:11.333 --> 35:14.033
and you get out
of the same space.

35:14.066 --> 35:17.100
Okay, all right.
Thank you so much.

35:17.133 --> 35:20.533
The payment is intimacy,
which we all yearn for.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.433
I'm gonna step outside.

35:22.467 --> 35:25.166
- She's exactly the way
you described everything too.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.467
It's, like, so important.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.600
- Dude, she can talk for hours.

35:28.633 --> 35:31.667
- I could literally listen
to her for 24 hours straight.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.433
- That's what I was saying.

35:33.467 --> 35:35.133
- I like imagining
turning myself

35:35.166 --> 35:37.600
into an actual dinosaur
with, like, reptile skin.

35:39.633 --> 35:45.000
- Schwartz and Jax...
told me that,

35:45.033 --> 35:47.700
at your birthday party,
you said,

35:47.734 --> 35:49.467
"Ariana doesn't
want to have kids.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.467
It's a deal breaker for me."

35:51.500 --> 35:53.467
- At one point, he was like--
literally stood up on his feet

35:53.500 --> 35:55.367
and, he was like,
"Well"--he's like--"It is."

35:55.400 --> 35:57.033
He's like, "If Ariana doesn't
want to have kids,

35:57.066 --> 35:58.433
it's gonna be
a deal breaker for me."

35:58.467 --> 36:00.533
- I'm like,
"Well, A, news to me.

36:00.567 --> 36:03.100
B, there's the door."

36:03.133 --> 36:05.567
Like, you're not
being held hostage.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.166
- First of all,
I apologize for saying that.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.400
There's so many ways

36:10.433 --> 36:12.200
to put that
that don't sound like that.

36:12.233 --> 36:14.100
- It's disrespectful to me,
'cause I feel like

36:14.133 --> 36:16.033
that doesn't really make it
seem like

36:16.066 --> 36:18.633
we're that great of a team.
- We're a great team.

36:18.667 --> 36:22.033
- Because if you did want
to do that in the future,

36:22.066 --> 36:26.100
it requires being
a very good team.

36:26.133 --> 36:27.633
- But the fact
of the matter is,

36:27.667 --> 36:30.000
I mean, that feels like--
if it was a thing,

36:30.033 --> 36:33.033
it feels like
it's five years out.

36:33.066 --> 36:36.200
- Oh, I thought you said
ten years out.

36:36.233 --> 36:38.200
- Great.

36:38.233 --> 36:42.633
So in ten years, I can bring up
the possibility of having kids.

36:42.667 --> 36:45.133
So you're telling me
there's a chance.

36:45.166 --> 36:47.734
Ariana, listen.
It's something I want so badly.

36:47.767 --> 36:49.667
If you don't want
to be involved,

36:49.700 --> 36:53.166
I will take care of the child,
but if you do, that's great.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.133
If not,
I'll give you the choice.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.667
Do you want to stay with me
while I do this or do you not?

36:57.700 --> 36:59.133
How much do you want
to be involved

36:59.166 --> 37:01.066
or if you want to be
involved at all

37:01.100 --> 37:04.000
or if you even want to be
involved with me at that point?

37:04.033 --> 37:06.500
So it'll be on you.

37:06.533 --> 37:09.200
- Tom, I feel like this is,
like, so progressive of us.

37:09.233 --> 37:10.667
- Yes.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.600
- Everything you just said
to me was,

37:12.633 --> 37:15.133
like, the most beautiful thing
you could've ever said.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.633
The way other people talk
about it make it sound

37:17.667 --> 37:19.533
like you have to break up.

37:19.567 --> 37:22.667
To me, is where I start
to get reptilian.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.500
- Chop the head off.

37:25.533 --> 37:26.700
- She's amazing.

37:26.734 --> 37:31.066
- I know.
She lets me be myself.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.166
- Oh, hey, y'all.

37:33.200 --> 37:37.700
Fancy meeting y'all in here.
I'm gonna sit right here.

37:37.734 --> 37:39.633
You and Tom have been together
for what, six, seven years?

37:39.667 --> 37:41.500
- Eight years.

37:41.533 --> 37:42.734
- And y'all hit
little bit of lulls,

37:42.767 --> 37:44.567
a little bit of bad patches,

37:44.600 --> 37:46.633
and yet you're still gonna
grow, and you and Beau,

37:46.667 --> 37:49.667
I'm so proud of you guys.
Like, he's the best man ever.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.200
But I don't get why
you guys have to be,

37:51.233 --> 37:54.533
like, badmouthing me.

37:54.567 --> 37:56.166
- Carter, Carter, we were
not badmouthing you.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.166
I regurgitated everything
that she said

37:58.200 --> 38:00.033
about you to me to her.

38:00.066 --> 38:01.567
- See, you hear
all the bad stuff.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.433
- Look me in the eye
and tell me

38:03.467 --> 38:06.600
that you guys are
in an awesome relationship.

38:12.734 --> 38:13.367
- See, you hear all

38:13.367 --> 38:13.667
- See, you hear all
the bad stuff.

38:15.533 --> 38:17.100
- My text messages
always saying that,

38:17.133 --> 38:19.100
"I need to get a Xanax.
I need to get some weed.

38:19.133 --> 38:20.734
"I need something because
Carter's being mean to me.

38:20.767 --> 38:23.633
Carter's being mean to me."
For years.

38:23.667 --> 38:26.166
- I'm getting relationship
from you, who hasn't been

38:26.200 --> 38:28.000
in a good relationship
until three months ago?

38:28.033 --> 38:29.633
- You're right, exactly.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.266
- We have been dating
for almost three years now,

38:31.300 --> 38:33.100
and there was
a little rocky patch.

38:33.133 --> 38:35.500
I would admit that.
I did not handle my sh--.

38:35.533 --> 38:37.233
When she goes to vent to you,
and you guys--

38:37.266 --> 38:39.266
- I feel rude having
this conversation

38:39.300 --> 38:42.000
in y'alls' bed, honestly.
It makes me very uncomfortable.

38:42.033 --> 38:43.166
- I do too. It is very awkward.

38:48.633 --> 38:50.233
- Do you know what's awkward
is having to sit there

38:50.266 --> 38:52.700
and listen to Kristen
all the time be so upset,

38:52.734 --> 38:56.100
be miserable for so long
for the way you treat her.

38:56.133 --> 38:58.100
- I know that I need to stop
bitching about my friends,

38:58.133 --> 39:00.266
so the second he walks in
is not for me to go,

39:00.300 --> 39:03.133
"Oh, my God, you have no idea
what happened today."

39:03.166 --> 39:04.600
'Cause he's like,
"What the (BLEEP)?"

39:04.633 --> 39:06.533
And he's a man.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.000
Like, it's the difference
between men and women too.

39:08.033 --> 39:10.133
- His reptilian brain
gets inducted.

39:10.166 --> 39:12.000
It's impossible, right.

39:12.033 --> 39:14.266
- You know why she comes home
and we get in fights?

39:14.300 --> 39:16.300
It's because you guys
are ----ing dicks to her.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.266
- All right, bye.
- You guys ----ing rude.

39:18.300 --> 39:21.300
- Carter, all she wants is
you to be ----ing nice to her.

39:23.033 --> 39:24.567
- She comes home and gets
in fights with you

39:24.600 --> 39:26.166
because of me and Katie?

39:26.200 --> 39:28.767
- Because you guys are scary.
Y'all scary.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.667
- Hi.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.300
- So Carter is saying that
the reason you guys fight

39:32.333 --> 39:34.066
is because of me and Katie.
- That's not what I said.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.633
- So number one, everyone stop
yelling in my house.

39:35.667 --> 39:36.767
- You guys do enough
yelling here.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I know. I get it.

39:39.033 --> 39:40.600
- Are we the reason that you
and Carter are fighting?

39:40.633 --> 39:42.700
- Right now, in my home,

39:42.734 --> 39:46.600
do not raise your voice,
especially in my bedroom, okay?

39:46.633 --> 39:49.033
- Are you fight--okay, okay.
This is--I feel like I'm--yeah.

39:49.066 --> 39:50.400
- This is a joke.

39:50.433 --> 39:51.700
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
Don't deflect.

39:51.734 --> 39:53.266
- Reptilian.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.033
- Does that mean
my presentation failed?

39:55.066 --> 39:56.300
- Do I go in there right now?

39:56.333 --> 39:57.734
- I shouldn't have
made them shots.

39:57.767 --> 39:59.367
- What did you put
in those shots?

39:59.400 --> 40:02.233
- Everything I said about him
to you were things

40:02.266 --> 40:03.734
that you had said to me, okay.

40:03.767 --> 40:06.300
- We are not making
anything up, Kristen.

40:06.333 --> 40:07.700
- I'm insulted right now.

40:07.734 --> 40:09.567
- He's saying that
you come home

40:09.600 --> 40:11.367
and say that you
guys fight because of us.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.266
- No, no.
- Can you please stop yelling?

40:13.300 --> 40:14.266
- That's not what I said.
- You said that.

40:14.300 --> 40:16.000
I made you repeat it.

40:16.033 --> 40:17.633
- All right, reptilian brain.
Reptilian brain.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.133
- My reptilian brain is gonna

40:19.166 --> 40:21.000
make me
walk myself out because--

40:21.033 --> 40:22.333
- If that's what you need
to do, then do that.

40:22.367 --> 40:25.000
- But Carter said the reason
you guys fight

40:25.033 --> 40:26.600
is because of me and Katie.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.233
- When she comes home after
hanging out with you,

40:29.266 --> 40:32.233
yes, we get in arguments
because y'all are very nasty.

40:32.266 --> 40:34.100
- Can we all take a breath?
- Oh, my God.

40:34.133 --> 40:35.433
- She comes to me for advice.
- Don't yell at her.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.266
- Yes. How many--
oh, my God, so then

40:37.300 --> 40:39.633
I should just ignore
my best friend all the time?

40:39.667 --> 40:41.266
- Jesus (BLEEP).

40:41.300 --> 40:42.400
I'm gonna leave
my own house right now.

40:42.433 --> 40:44.300
Katie and Schwartz,

40:44.333 --> 40:48.367
every single time they went
through a bunch of bullsh--,

40:48.400 --> 40:50.734
including before their wedding,
I still went,

40:50.767 --> 40:53.233
"You got this.
I have your back."

40:53.266 --> 40:58.433
Stassi and Patrick, same thing.
So just be there for me.

40:58.467 --> 41:01.166
Don't be there for the demise
of my relationship.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.467
- All you hear
is the bad stuff.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.767
You have no idea
about the good stuff.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.266
- 'Cause there's nothing good

41:05.300 --> 41:08.000
that she ever says
about you, Carter.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.367
- How sh---y was it
before you got married?

41:09.400 --> 41:11.166
- You are legitimately
a terrible arguer.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.200
- How sh---y was it
before you got married?

41:12.233 --> 41:13.700
- Uh, go (BLEEP) yourself.

41:13.734 --> 41:14.700
- Exactly.
- (BLEEP) this all.

41:14.734 --> 41:16.000
I'm leaving.

41:16.033 --> 41:17.767
- What do you mean?

41:18.000 --> 41:21.467
- There's a bunch of people
with amnesia here.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.767
- I'm about to sage
this mother----er.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.300
- What should I do?

41:24.333 --> 41:26.100
Should I go?
Should I let her de-escalate?

41:26.133 --> 41:28.200
- She is de-escalating.
- She's de-escalating.

41:28.233 --> 41:29.667
- Should I--
- Unless she wants you to go.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.033
- Should he go?
- No.

41:31.066 --> 41:32.367
- I'm gonna give her a second

41:32.400 --> 41:34.033
'cause I'm not
good at de-escalating.

41:34.066 --> 41:35.233
- Yeah, so just wait.
- I'm like,

41:35.266 --> 41:36.266
"Why are you so mad?
Chill out."

41:36.300 --> 41:38.367
- May I ask one favor?

41:38.400 --> 41:40.433
Try not to raise voices
or cuss and talk.

41:40.467 --> 41:42.033
- No, I smell too much--
- I'm sorry.

41:42.066 --> 41:46.033
- Kristen saged me.
She saged me.

41:46.066 --> 41:47.400
- Do you want to get

41:47.433 --> 41:49.667
Isa out of this?
Because this is not her.

41:49.700 --> 41:52.433
Kristen has spent the first
35 years of her life

41:52.467 --> 41:55.166
in a blind, vengeful,
drunken rage,

41:55.200 --> 41:58.066
helicopter-punching anyone
who's in her path.

41:58.100 --> 41:59.500
Then she meets Beau's mom,

41:59.533 --> 42:01.266
and all of a sudden,
she's Mahatma Gandhi

42:01.300 --> 42:03.100
and saging everyone
in her apartment?

42:03.133 --> 42:05.066
Give me a ----ing break.

42:05.100 --> 42:07.400
- I didn't want it to end
like this. This sucks.

42:07.433 --> 42:09.700
- Then stop lying.

42:14.133 --> 42:16.300
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:16.333 --> 42:17.734
Invite your friends

42:17.767 --> 42:20.066
to come to look at it
and enjoy it.

42:20.100 --> 42:23.467
- And then we are open?
- Open.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.033
- Do you guys bedazzle?

42:25.066 --> 42:27.033
- My flower is about
to be decorated.

42:27.066 --> 42:28.233
- Is it ornate?

42:28.266 --> 42:30.166
- This is a big one.
- Ah!

42:30.200 --> 42:32.033
- Now you look like
a 12-year-old boy.

42:32.066 --> 42:33.433
- Please hold my hand.

42:33.467 --> 42:36.333
- ♪ Let's go, let's go ♪

42:38.333 --> 42:40.100
- Vamos a México.

42:40.133 --> 42:42.033
We're gonna go to
Puerto Vallarta.

42:42.066 --> 42:44.066
- Are you inviting me?
- I mean, yes.

42:44.100 --> 42:46.300
- Sandoval invited James
and Raquel.

42:46.333 --> 42:48.200
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

42:48.233 --> 42:51.166
You're a ----ing asshole.
You're a ----ing asshole.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.400
- No, I'm not.
- All right, all right.

42:52.433 --> 42:53.767
- Wow. Wow.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.400
- I can say whatever
the (BLEEP)

42:55.433 --> 42:57.033
I want to anybody,
but if somebody calls me fat,

42:57.066 --> 42:58.033
I'm getting their ass
----ing fired!

42:58.066 --> 42:59.400
- Stop!
- Chill.

42:59.433 --> 43:01.133
- You're a bully.
