WEBVTT

00:06.258 --> 00:08.887
GOSSIP GIRL

00:09.512 --> 00:12.472
Sweet afternoon, amorous ones.

00:12.472 --> 00:18.646
To celebrate or not to celebrate ?
That is not a question.

00:19.146 --> 00:21.064
One simple thing separates

00:21.064 --> 00:25.111
those who love Valentine's Day
from those who do not,

00:25.111 --> 00:29.657
and it has nothing to do
with candy hearts or singing telegrams.

00:29.657 --> 00:35.037
It's all about that plus one.
Or in some cases, that plus two.

00:35.037 --> 00:37.789
What ? Thought you liked
it when I bite ?

00:38.249 --> 00:40.459
Uh, you two go.
Um, I wanna watch.

00:42.961 --> 00:45.756
That's the third time
he's sat out this week.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.429
Well, let's just give him a show then.

00:51.429 --> 00:56.475
But what about those of you who
are spending this V-Day plus none ?

00:57.226 --> 01:01.231
Welcome to "Stop the Story."
Obie was my first real love.

01:01.606 --> 01:04.858
And I wanted to show all of you
just how great that love was.

01:04.858 --> 01:07.694
But, I picked and chose what I saw.

01:08.237 --> 01:10.322
I'm stopping that story,

01:10.698 --> 01:12.991
I'm gonna take you
behind the scenes of moments

01:12.991 --> 01:16.746
that looked perfect
but were actually... painful.

01:16.746 --> 01:19.331
Curated instead of experienced.

01:19.666 --> 01:24.045
Hoped Obie would be my guest
on pulling back that curtain, but...

01:24.712 --> 01:28.924
As you can see,
he's stopped my story all by himself.

01:28.924 --> 01:30.760
Okay. Leave a comment.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.762
Have you made amends with an ex ?
Do you hope to ?

01:33.762 --> 01:37.225
And I'll see you back here at five
for the truth

01:37.225 --> 01:41.104
about how hard "making it look easy" is
on the people who love you.

01:41.104 --> 01:45.774
What really matters are the ways
we show up for that special someone.

01:46.484 --> 01:49.403
And making sure
they're showing up for you, too.

01:49.904 --> 01:52.906
You coming on the live soon or...

01:56.452 --> 01:58.913
I have a surprise for you.

01:58.913 --> 02:02.082
Better be a black car taking you
to school. You're going to be late !

02:02.082 --> 02:03.459
Look, I've missed you this week,

02:03.459 --> 02:06.461
and I wanted to do something special
for your coming back up and all.

02:06.461 --> 02:08.798
So, I decided I'd make breakfast
from your favorite restaurant.

02:08.798 --> 02:11.884
And then I remembered that
you really like the gougčres of Benoit.

02:12.218 --> 02:14.136
And more importantly,
I don't know how to cook.

02:14.136 --> 02:17.681
So I thought,
why not bring Benoit to you ?

02:19.058 --> 02:21.436
Matias:
Can't wait to taste you.

02:22.102 --> 02:23.770
Maybe it's too much.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.481
But a week is a long time
to be apart

02:25.481 --> 02:28.692
from your perfect, amazing,
hopefully famished girlfriend.

02:28.692 --> 02:30.403
It's wonderful.

02:30.403 --> 02:32.363
Can't it be like this all the time ?

02:32.363 --> 02:34.364
You know I'd be here if I could,

02:34.364 --> 02:37.159
If only I could be two places at once,

02:45.418 --> 02:49.671
This Hallmark-created holiday
is for kissing and telling.

02:50.089 --> 02:54.636
Or wanting to kiss
and telling them, too.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.432
Is that another new suit ?

02:59.432 --> 03:02.268
Yeah. Greyson de Haan
sent a couple over.

03:02.602 --> 03:04.229
A part of the welcome, I guess ?

03:04.229 --> 03:05.896
Or a reminder that he bought you.

03:05.896 --> 03:08.482
Like Monet buys people, you know,
it kinda runs in their family.

03:08.482 --> 03:12.529
Slow down, 1619 Project.
You're forgetting I'm not for sale.

03:12.903 --> 03:15.781
Right. I'm sure that's
what The Post told Bezos.

03:22.247 --> 03:23.748
Dinner ? Together ?
Tomorrow ?

03:23.748 --> 03:25.041
In the most non-Valentine's day
way possible ?

03:27.418 --> 03:30.337
What's the least V-Day thing
we could do ?

03:32.674 --> 03:35.842
Mission to make Valentine's Day
unsexy. She did it Joe !

03:35.842 --> 03:39.137
Whatever your plans,
Liz Taylor once said,

03:39.137 --> 03:41.807
"Pour yourself a drink,
put on some lipstick...

03:41.807 --> 03:44.017
and pull yourself together."

03:45.770 --> 03:49.065
So, followers, pucker up.

03:51.568 --> 03:53.528
Small iced oat latte ?

03:54.653 --> 03:57.198
Excuse me. Iced oat latte ?

03:57.866 --> 03:59.951
Oh, yeah. Sorry...

04:01.743 --> 04:06.499
Wait. Didn't we meet
at the Debutante thing or...

04:06.499 --> 04:08.959
I thought I recognized you.

04:08.959 --> 04:11.671
- Uh, Graham Smith.
- Julien Calloway.

04:12.130 --> 04:16.593
Nice to see you again away from...
whatever it is that that was.

04:20.512 --> 04:22.014
You got a gig near here ?

04:22.014 --> 04:25.560
Just on my way to class.
I go to Mannes School of Music.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.020
You just carry that thing
everywhere with you, huh ?

04:28.020 --> 04:29.314
You get used to it.

04:29.314 --> 04:33.234
It was more ridiculous when I was
twelve and it was twice my size.

04:33.234 --> 04:34.861
You play anything ?

04:35.570 --> 04:38.405
This is the only instrument
I'm any good with.

04:38.405 --> 04:40.240
What do you do with that ?

04:40.240 --> 04:43.745
Well, I used to use it
to perpetrate a whole bunch of lies

04:43.745 --> 04:46.664
to help people feel bad
about themselves.

04:46.664 --> 04:50.251
But, now I'm trying this thing
called honesty, you know ?

04:50.251 --> 04:53.713
Pulling back the facade.
Exposing the lies beneath.

04:54.172 --> 04:56.089
How postmodern.

04:56.089 --> 05:00.177
Or what I'm doing before
I distract myself with something else ?

05:00.177 --> 05:04.140
I feel like I keep trying things,
and nothing seems to be working.

05:04.140 --> 05:05.849
Maybe this time.

05:06.516 --> 05:12.189
As much as I appreciate the company,
isn't this the wrong way to Mannes ?

05:12.189 --> 05:14.484
Wow, she knows where Mannes is !

05:14.900 --> 05:17.903
My dad's a musician.
Oh... was a musician. So.

05:17.903 --> 05:21.615
I kinda want to hear more
about your Stop the Story thing.

05:22.575 --> 05:25.285
Okay, I started following you
after the Deb brawl.

05:25.285 --> 05:27.121
Way to bury the lede !

05:28.581 --> 05:34.086
The next one I'm doing is about being
tragically single on Valentine's Day.

05:34.086 --> 05:36.421
You could make a guest appearance ?

05:38.091 --> 05:40.426
You're married ?
How old are you ?

05:40.426 --> 05:43.971
Twenty-one. Uh...
High school sweetheart. Long story.

05:44.763 --> 05:46.848
I'm sure it's a really good one.

05:46.848 --> 05:50.478
Yeah, it's... She's great.

05:52.437 --> 05:55.065
Nice to meet you officially, Graham.

05:55.065 --> 05:56.817
You, too.

06:05.742 --> 06:08.788
Hey, so, unexpected news.

06:08.788 --> 06:11.040
We already know about you and Shubin.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.084
Nothing to know. Just hanging out.

06:13.084 --> 06:14.293
Clothes on or off ?

06:14.293 --> 06:15.836
Wendy ! I don't wanna hear about that.

06:15.836 --> 06:18.255
She's not your mom.
She's allowed to have sex.

06:18.255 --> 06:20.465
Gossip Girl just got
photographic evidence

06:20.465 --> 06:22.969
that Greyson de Haan
is cheating on Camille.

06:22.969 --> 06:27.223
Merry Christmas ? Isn't that, like,
the one gift you've always wanted ?

06:27.682 --> 06:31.978
Where is it ? I keep refreshing.
I miss being in on the action.

06:31.978 --> 06:33.605
I didn't post it yet.

06:33.605 --> 06:37.858
I thought I would do the right thing,
tell Camille privately first.

06:37.858 --> 06:41.237
It's not because goody-two-Shubins
is getting to you ?

06:41.237 --> 06:44.197
- Morning.
- Morning...

06:45.867 --> 06:49.621
I simply thought I would extend it
as an interpersonal olive branch

06:49.621 --> 06:52.707
to repair whatever wrong foot
she and I got off on.

06:52.707 --> 06:54.875
Right, because telling someone
their husband is cheating on them

06:54.875 --> 06:57.003
always makes them like you.

06:57.753 --> 07:00.214
Jillian Vose is guesting
at Dumbo Hall tonight.

07:00.214 --> 07:02.217
What do you say
to a Valentine's Eve pre-game ?

07:02.217 --> 07:07.054
After, since Dad and Pops are further
cementing their reconciliation,

07:07.387 --> 07:10.475
we've got an entire townhouse
to ourselves.

07:10.475 --> 07:13.019
We might have to try some new things
in some new rooms.

07:13.019 --> 07:15.729
I... promised my mom we'd hang out.

07:15.729 --> 07:19.066
- I haven't seen her in a while.
- Your mom ?

07:19.734 --> 07:22.153
I'll see you at brunch tomorrow ?

07:28.409 --> 07:32.079
That's odd. Jodie always spends V-Day
in Vail with Warren Buffet.

07:32.079 --> 07:34.039
Don't ask me how that guy still skiis.

07:34.039 --> 07:36.083
Are you sure she's going this year ?

07:36.083 --> 07:38.418
I helped her pick an apres-ski
look just last week.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.879
First he shuts down in bed,
and now he's lying to us.

07:40.879 --> 07:43.925
My Spidey senses are tingling, Hope.
And not in a good way.

07:43.925 --> 07:47.094
- How long is Grace here this time ?
- Forty-eight hours.

07:47.094 --> 07:49.472
Yeah, I mean, it was great
when we were together every day.

07:49.472 --> 07:53.934
But now, after this trip, she doesn't
plan on coming back for a month.

07:53.934 --> 07:57.021
This long distance thing's just...
I mean, it kills relationships.

07:57.021 --> 07:58.439
What if you didn't have to do it ?

07:58.439 --> 08:00.774
What, just leave school and follow her
on her mom's campaign trail ?

08:00.774 --> 08:03.987
- Why doesn't she just enroll here ?
- Like Constance here ?

08:03.987 --> 08:07.574
No, look, I'm sure she wants to spend
as much time with you as you do her.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.368
Maybe she's just waiting
for you to ask.

08:10.368 --> 08:13.496
Thanks, Ak. I hadn't...
I hadn't thought of that.

08:17.374 --> 08:19.209
C'mon. Let's get out of here.

08:23.339 --> 08:25.383
I felt that chill from here.

08:25.383 --> 08:27.301
Okay, so it's not just me.

08:27.301 --> 08:29.470
Oh, no. No.
He's definitely avoiding you.

08:29.470 --> 08:31.013
Just like old times !

08:31.013 --> 08:33.932
Good thing we get to turn our minds off
at our annual spa day.

08:33.932 --> 08:36.143
Our minds ? You, too ?

08:36.853 --> 08:39.189
With two people it's easy to know
when you're on the same page,

08:39.189 --> 08:41.356
but what if there isn't room for three ?

08:41.356 --> 08:42.941
Gotta think about how to work out
our kinks

08:42.941 --> 08:44.986
while Tamiko works out my kinks tomorrow.

08:44.986 --> 08:48.071
And as for Mr. Bergmann,
I think you know what that's about.

08:48.071 --> 08:49.573
That it's hard being friends
with an ex

08:49.573 --> 08:53.035
with your new girlfriend around
no matter how much you wish it wasn't.

08:53.453 --> 08:55.663
Stop the story. I think she's got it.

08:55.663 --> 08:57.789
"Can she let it be ?"
is another story...

08:58.166 --> 09:00.627
Let's get falafel,
hang at Bleeker playground !

09:00.627 --> 09:02.962
Time Out rated it
the best place to dump someone,

09:02.962 --> 09:06.466
so there's bound to be some deeply
tragic breakups night before V-Day.

09:06.466 --> 09:09.344
Yeah, while that sounds
absolutely terrible...

09:09.344 --> 09:11.887
I'm committed to spending the day
with my dad.

09:11.887 --> 09:13.932
Yeah, we're committed to this bit

09:13.932 --> 09:16.475
where we painfully mask
the weirdness between us.

09:16.475 --> 09:18.518
You think
he's a burgeoning corporate overlord,

09:18.518 --> 09:20.188
but what if he's a Trojan Horse ?

09:20.188 --> 09:22.689
Changing things secretly
from the inside ?

09:23.106 --> 09:26.402
Yeah. He's a good guy.
Unless you know something I don't.

09:29.405 --> 09:31.949
How bout I join you ?
I need help with my V-Day plans.

09:31.949 --> 09:33.367
I'm going full Bachelorette,

09:33.367 --> 09:36.370
ten suitors lined up
for the Kiss on the Lips party.

09:36.370 --> 09:38.957
Ten ? I don't even have one.

09:38.957 --> 09:41.417
- What about Terrell ?
- Terrell who ?

09:41.417 --> 09:43.378
Don't play like you haven't been
stalking him since the Deb Ball.

09:43.378 --> 09:46.046
You can't stalk somebody who
doesn't have social media presence.

09:46.046 --> 09:48.967
Do you know how many pictures I've
seen that are just hashtag Terrell ?

09:48.967 --> 09:52.010
I know nothing about him
besides how hot he is.

09:52.010 --> 09:54.638
Girl, that's why you ask someone out.
The "out" is to find out.

09:54.638 --> 09:56.516
- Move it, peons !
- Sorry.

09:57.474 --> 09:59.977
He was Monet's escort.
Get her to hook you up.

10:00.352 --> 10:03.815
- I'm not asking the queen of mean.
- Fine. I will.

10:04.273 --> 10:05.691
Yo Mo Mo !

10:06.276 --> 10:08.735
Lil Z's and me's has a query for ya.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.489
Are they on the agenda ?

10:11.489 --> 10:13.867
It's just one simple question.
We don't need an appointment for that.

10:13.867 --> 10:15.702
Have you ever heard of precedence ?

10:15.702 --> 10:17.787
If we do it for you,
we have to do it for anyone.

10:17.787 --> 10:20.455
And we do not do things for anyone.

10:22.916 --> 10:26.545
Terrell Carter. I was wondering if you
could make an intro for me with him ?

10:26.545 --> 10:29.840
Do I look like Cupid for poors ?
Kindly move along.

10:30.383 --> 10:32.593
The lower steps are getting bold.

10:32.593 --> 10:33.803
What is Harris wearing ?

10:33.803 --> 10:37.599
Queen D, I know your dress code
said only designer khakis,

10:37.599 --> 10:40.893
but Matches, Mr. Porter, and
Essence sold out in my sample size,

10:40.893 --> 10:42.978
so I had no choice
but to Rag and Bone,

10:42.978 --> 10:46.983
I kneel before thee as a sign
of remorse. It'll never happen again.

10:46.983 --> 10:48.859
Hey, I eased up on the dress code
last week.

10:48.859 --> 10:52.112
But addressing me
by my proper title ? That stays.

10:52.112 --> 10:53.990
Thank you for this kindness.

10:57.075 --> 10:59.286
No, be who you are ! It's okay !

10:59.621 --> 11:01.622
Why does no one believe me ?

11:01.622 --> 11:06.460
We all thought it was a trick,
they're expecting to be excoriated.

11:07.002 --> 11:09.421
Were you actually serious ?

11:09.421 --> 11:11.466
What... When am I ever not ?

11:11.924 --> 11:15.344
Too many restrictions is turning
people against me. I can feel it.

11:15.344 --> 11:17.387
Yes, because they fear you.

11:17.387 --> 11:19.432
I want them to like and fear me.

11:19.933 --> 11:21.850
That's not possible.

11:21.850 --> 11:24.354
Sure it is.
Look at Shonda Rhimes.

11:24.896 --> 11:28.525
You'd have to give them a reason
to like you. Like Julien did.

11:28.525 --> 11:32.487
Fear may have gotten you to the top,
but only respect can keep you there.

11:32.487 --> 11:35.239
Well, isn't teaching them style
and taste worthy of respect ?

11:35.239 --> 11:37.283
Julien is kind, okay ?

11:37.283 --> 11:41.787
That's why she gains 20,000 followers
just by blinking on TikTok.

11:41.787 --> 11:43.414
If you want what she has,

11:43.414 --> 11:45.458
you have to rule with an open hand.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.501
Not an iron fist.

11:47.501 --> 11:50.296
- Say more things.
- The annual Kiss on the Lips party.

11:50.296 --> 11:52.172
That only the reigning Queen
gets to throw.

11:52.172 --> 11:55.592
Should be open to all,
not exclusive for next-to-none.

11:55.592 --> 11:58.720
Show everyone a good time,
and you can reign forever.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.641
Oh, Luna, Forever in La-land.

12:01.641 --> 12:05.270
If you invite all the P's ? 'Kay ?
Then the Vi's don't show.

12:05.270 --> 12:06.687
Take my advice.

12:06.687 --> 12:11.025
Or don't, the longer this goes on,
the less time you do.

12:11.608 --> 12:12.693
Guess that's what you get

12:12.693 --> 12:16.239
by outsourcing your henchwomen
from Midtown East.

12:18.616 --> 12:22.202
You heard her. Open the gates
and make it friendlier than ever.

12:22.202 --> 12:24.246
Love is all around. Got that ?

12:31.670 --> 12:34.883
- You shouldn't have come here.
- I haven't seen you in a week.

12:34.883 --> 12:38.553
- The campaign is keeping me busy.
- As well as this Obie guy.

12:38.553 --> 12:40.597
My mom forbade me to see you.

12:40.597 --> 12:43.557
"This Obie guy" keeps her
off our tracks.

12:43.557 --> 12:45.685
She thinks I'm with him
when I'm with you,

12:45.685 --> 12:47.937
and he thinks I'm with her
when I'm with you.

12:47.937 --> 12:49.521
Works for everyone.

12:49.521 --> 12:52.149
But you weren't with either of us
last week.

12:52.149 --> 12:56.154
Sometimes that's unavoidable...
Wait, was that the elevator ?

12:56.529 --> 12:59.490
- It's a big building.
- You need to go now.

12:59.490 --> 13:02.326
- Sure you aren't enjoying this ?
- Why aren't you leaving ?

13:02.326 --> 13:03.493
Maybe I want him to see us ?

13:03.493 --> 13:06.831
No, Matías, you don't.
Please just hide now !

13:09.042 --> 13:10.460
- Obie !
- Hi.

13:10.460 --> 13:11.753
You're back early.

13:11.753 --> 13:14.463
Hi. I had this idea
and I wanted to share with you.

13:14.463 --> 13:16.673
There's always the phone.

13:18.009 --> 13:20.345
Are you okay ?
You look a little flushed.

13:20.345 --> 13:23.348
Just took a hot shower.
What's up ?

13:24.097 --> 13:26.100
Well, I know how much you hate
traveling with your mom.

13:26.100 --> 13:29.479
And I was just thinking that maybe you
didn't have to.

13:31.521 --> 13:34.524
God, you look so sexy right now !

13:48.080 --> 13:51.041
Sorry, you're just so irresistible.

13:54.671 --> 13:56.631
What were you going to say ?

13:59.509 --> 14:04.806
Nothing. Just, just... glad we get
to spend Valentine's Day together.

14:05.473 --> 14:07.851
- Thank you so much !
- Of course, Ms. de Haan.

14:10.270 --> 14:14.315
Mrs. de Haan.
I was actually hoping to see you.

14:14.940 --> 14:18.903
And here I am just coming
from a talk with our new Head Teacher.

14:19.361 --> 14:20.904
She wanted to get acquainted

14:20.904 --> 14:23.532
and hear who I feel are standouts
amongst the faculty

14:23.532 --> 14:25.702
and who I believe
might have slipped in

14:25.702 --> 14:29.621
due to her predecessor's
significantly lower standards.

14:29.621 --> 14:32.458
And where do I fall in your eyes ?

14:36.004 --> 14:40.215
Before you go, I owe it to you
to share some information.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.679
I know it's none of my business,

14:45.096 --> 14:49.099
but I saw your husband this morning

14:49.642 --> 14:52.603
exiting The Bowery
with another woman.

14:52.603 --> 14:54.938
And I can only imagine if I saw them,

14:54.938 --> 14:57.317
someone else could've,
and go tell Gossip Girl.

14:57.317 --> 15:01.279
Whatever you think you saw,
I assure you, it was not my husband.

15:01.279 --> 15:05.782
While I do not appreciate the accusation
you're making about my marriage,

15:05.782 --> 15:09.204
I will not notify the Head Teacher
about this purely out of sympathy

15:09.204 --> 15:13.499
for whatever episode
you are clearly having.

15:14.249 --> 15:19.088
But if you ever try
something like this again

15:19.463 --> 15:22.716
or if a tip about this ends up
on Gossip Girl,

15:23.051 --> 15:27.972
your head will roll so fast
and so far...

15:30.475 --> 15:32.726
... you'll never catch up to it.

15:34.019 --> 15:35.103
Hey !

15:35.103 --> 15:36.897
Hey, babe.
I'm just running late for Jodi.

15:36.897 --> 15:39.567
I won't keep you.
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.027
Why do you keep asking me that ?

15:41.027 --> 15:42.946
We're your partners !
We want to see how you're doing.

15:42.946 --> 15:46.908
I'm annoyed by you asking ?
I would tell you if I wasn't fine.

15:47.242 --> 15:49.452
Your hair's wet.
Did you just have PE ?

15:50.036 --> 15:53.164
Yeah. I'll see you at the Kiss
on the Lips party tomorrow.

15:54.666 --> 15:56.333
What did I miss ?

15:56.333 --> 15:59.211
Making Aki upset
for asking him how he was ?

15:59.211 --> 16:01.339
PE must've riled him up.

16:01.339 --> 16:05.093
He doesn't take PE this semester.
He's on the wrestling team.

16:05.093 --> 16:06.928
And they don't meet today.

16:06.928 --> 16:08.888
He just showered.

16:09.848 --> 16:11.473
What do you wanna do ?

16:12.224 --> 16:14.434
I wanted to thank you
for your advice earlier.

16:14.434 --> 16:16.395
And I want to thank you for yours.

16:16.395 --> 16:19.815
I'm gonna be spending
the afternoon alone. Just me.

16:19.815 --> 16:22.360
Same here.
I'm just gonna let Aki Aki.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.153
Gonna let Obie Obie.

16:24.153 --> 16:25.947
See you tomorrow ?

16:37.666 --> 16:40.794
Dr. Eamonn Veta.
The Menzies' GP.

16:49.304 --> 16:52.307
Happy Valentine's Eve, followers.

16:52.307 --> 16:54.267
Just as certain as tomorrow

16:54.267 --> 16:56.143
will be our Upper East Sider's

16:56.143 --> 17:00.273
annual, ultra exclusive
"Kiss on the Lips" party

17:00.273 --> 17:03.484
I bear the promise
of another sure thing.

17:04.068 --> 17:06.987
This year, Cupid is taking the day off.

17:07.447 --> 17:10.325
So to those of you who might be busy
spending the day

17:10.325 --> 17:14.244
making plans
to find love, know this.

17:14.579 --> 17:17.999
I'm taking over.
And I'm going to make sure

17:17.999 --> 17:21.335
you and your loved ones know it.

17:23.003 --> 17:25.006
Have they ever heard
of natural lighting, jeez ?

17:25.006 --> 17:26.216
Quiet. I'm trying to hear.

17:26.216 --> 17:29.844
I have to take it every day ?
And Descovy is the same thing ?

17:29.844 --> 17:31.094
As Truvada ? Yes.

17:31.094 --> 17:33.680
- Descovy ? What's that ?
- It's PrEP.

17:36.183 --> 17:38.769
It's not cancer. Thank God.

17:38.769 --> 17:40.604
It is for our relationship.

17:40.604 --> 17:43.650
If he's taking it now,
it can only mean one thing.

17:43.650 --> 17:45.943
He's about to cheat on us, Hope.

17:50.489 --> 17:52.324
And to kick things off,

17:52.324 --> 17:55.411
let me leave you
with a little blind item.

17:57.705 --> 18:00.749
Nothing is ever
as good as it seems.

18:02.168 --> 18:06.213
And just because you think you know
the person standing next to you

18:06.213 --> 18:10.092
doesn't mean there's not someone else
on the other side of them

18:10.092 --> 18:11.885
that you can't see.

18:21.061 --> 18:24.106
So how much does a place
like this go for, anyways ?

18:25.024 --> 18:27.526
That's not a very polite question
to ask, Miss Barnes.

18:27.526 --> 18:28.860
Just curious.

18:28.860 --> 18:31.531
It's cool how you were able
to buy it all of a sudden like that.

18:31.531 --> 18:32.866
Shan.

18:32.866 --> 18:36.368
It wasn't all of a sudden.
The deal's still going through.

18:36.368 --> 18:38.872
I looked. This place listed
for two and a half mil.

18:38.872 --> 18:42.000
But you snapped it up before
you got recruited by Darth Pharma.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.127
- Shan !
- Can we change the subject please ?

18:44.127 --> 18:46.754
I don't think my finances make good
dinner conversation with teenagers.

18:46.754 --> 18:48.922
My bad. Subject changed.

18:52.427 --> 18:56.139
To GossipGirl: There's something
you should know about y-dad...

18:56.471 --> 19:01.352
No fucking way ! Sweet Home Ali-basic
in illicit lip lock ? Are you sure ?

19:01.352 --> 19:03.228
I know what I saw, Audge.

19:03.228 --> 19:05.773
Okay, okay,
so here's what you're gonna do.

19:05.773 --> 19:07.859
Next time you see Obie,
you're gonna walk right up to him,

19:07.859 --> 19:10.319
and you're gonna act like
everything's completely normal.

19:10.319 --> 19:11.446
Not a word of what you saw.

19:11.446 --> 19:14.574
I can't let Grace do this to him.
He doesn't deserve it.

19:14.574 --> 19:17.160
Politely, strongly disagree
with that statement.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.952
He cares about her, Audrey.

19:18.952 --> 19:22.581
And... if I'm his friend,
I have to tell him.

19:22.581 --> 19:25.417
Okay. But, you're not his friend.
You're his ex.

19:25.417 --> 19:28.213
So if you do anything with this
information except keep it to yourself,

19:28.213 --> 19:29.506
then you'll seem vengeful
and selfish.

19:29.506 --> 19:32.091
- And honest ?
- He'll never believe you.

19:32.091 --> 19:34.677
Not after what you tried
to pull in Hudson.

19:34.677 --> 19:37.930
Look. You need to approach
this situation with finesse

19:37.930 --> 19:40.015
or you could lose him forever.

19:40.015 --> 19:41.684
And how do I do that ?

19:42.100 --> 19:46.480
By subtly and skillfully convincing
Grace to come clean on her own ?

19:47.982 --> 19:50.860
Done. And what about Ak ?

19:50.860 --> 19:53.111
I'm gonna try
and take my own advice.

19:53.111 --> 19:55.782
You know, Max and I
only have assumptions right now,

19:55.782 --> 19:58.952
so if we try to accuse him without facts
then it might blow up in our faces.

19:58.952 --> 20:03.331
And that would be very bad.
So, I need some facts.

20:03.331 --> 20:07.001
And I'll get them by asking him
honestly and with finesse.

20:07.417 --> 20:09.753
- Good luck.
- You, too.

20:11.965 --> 20:14.675
To Max:
We need to break into his phone.

20:14.675 --> 20:17.803
To Grace:
Up for a spa day with the girls ?

20:20.222 --> 20:22.975
Please don't tell me you're gonna
spend the day watching Love, actually ?

20:22.975 --> 20:25.143
It's a time-worn Valentine's tradition.

20:25.143 --> 20:27.647
You do realize how problematic
this movie is, don't you ?

20:27.647 --> 20:28.857
It's romantic.

20:28.857 --> 20:31.234
It's reductive, exploitative.
It's...

20:31.234 --> 20:35.655
How will I enjoy it without our annual
"crass or classic" commentary ?

20:39.033 --> 20:41.243
Friends again ?

20:41.243 --> 20:44.413
Almost. I figure
we're basically even now.

20:45.039 --> 20:48.625
Besides, I... I know you're only working
there to keep us here.

20:48.625 --> 20:51.211
Yes. Exactly.

20:55.841 --> 20:58.678
Since we're almost friends...

20:59.929 --> 21:01.638
Lay it on me.

21:02.557 --> 21:05.852
Shan has been acting weird lately.
You saw her at dinner last night.

21:05.852 --> 21:08.896
And I don't know why,
but it's kinda making me feel like

21:08.896 --> 21:11.523
I don't want to spend that much time
with her anymore.

21:11.523 --> 21:13.817
Here's a thought, just ask.

21:13.817 --> 21:15.528
Be honest
about how it makes you feel.

21:15.528 --> 21:17.279
Maybe if you and I had done
a little bit more of that

21:17.279 --> 21:19.907
we wouldn't have gotten
to where we were.

21:20.949 --> 21:24.077
Why don't you invite her
to the spa thing with the girls ?

21:24.077 --> 21:27.498
Talk. Relax. Reconnect.
Get to the bottom it.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.292
That's what friends do.

21:32.003 --> 21:33.338
Thank you.

21:39.676 --> 21:41.470
- There you are.
- Hey !

21:41.470 --> 21:43.263
You made it.
I didn't think you were gonna come.

21:43.263 --> 21:45.850
Why not ? I have a hangnail
that needs tending to.

21:46.225 --> 21:48.518
Well, um... I know things
have been really weird between us.

21:48.518 --> 21:50.938
I just wanted to make sure we're okay.

21:50.938 --> 21:53.232
We are, right ? You would tell me ?

21:53.608 --> 21:57.903
Actually, there is something
I need to tell you. It's about...

21:57.903 --> 21:59.738
Hey, girls !

22:01.073 --> 22:04.077
Your friend Terrell. At the Deb ball,
he asked me about you.

22:04.077 --> 22:07.372
I knew you liked him, but I was aggro
that night, so I blew him off.

22:07.372 --> 22:08.998
And I've felt terrible
about it ever since.

22:08.998 --> 22:10.875
Hey, it's fine. He's just a guy.

22:10.875 --> 22:12.919
A guy you should be
spending Valentine's with !

22:12.919 --> 22:17.005
No. It's just a distraction from all
the shit in my life. It's not real.

22:17.005 --> 22:19.550
Let's make it real. We need
to get him at the party tonight.

22:19.550 --> 22:22.512
How ? Monet has
his contact on lockdown.

22:22.512 --> 22:25.723
Which is why our mission is
to get it by any means necessary.

22:25.723 --> 22:27.849
She's here. We're here,
and so is her phone.

22:27.849 --> 22:30.269
By the end of this spa-ga,
I'm gonna have glowing skin,

22:30.269 --> 22:32.312
and you're gonna have a hot date.

22:32.312 --> 22:34.274
Welcome to today's "Stop the Story."

22:34.274 --> 22:38.444
I'm here at the spa with my girls, the
perfect place for a filterless convo.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.405
Set your alarms for a Q and A
with my nearest and dearest

22:41.405 --> 22:44.951
about the B.S.
behind this high-presh holiday.

22:44.951 --> 22:47.620
You better have brought them here
for me to ritually sacrifice

22:47.620 --> 22:50.581
because this is supposed
to be relaxing.

22:50.581 --> 22:53.500
I mean, who's even paying
for them ? Make-a-Wish ?

22:53.500 --> 22:56.003
There are treatments to be had
and live-streams to overshare.

22:56.003 --> 22:58.464
Just let them just fade
into the steam.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.259
And what about Queen Kong ?
I could see her anywhere !

23:03.051 --> 23:04.846
Gracie, you made it !

23:04.846 --> 23:05.971
I love it here !

23:05.971 --> 23:08.515
I came during their soft open
with Audrey Pence !

23:08.515 --> 23:10.977
I could def use some girl time.

23:10.977 --> 23:12.728
I bet you could !

23:14.354 --> 23:16.857
To Max:
You have the phone ?

23:17.775 --> 23:19.652
I can't just ask him to see it.

23:19.652 --> 23:23.196
I have to get him out of the room
but leave the phone behind.

23:23.196 --> 23:24.948
You remember the pw ?

23:24.948 --> 23:28.036
- 2046.
- Who could forget
that boring movie.

23:29.703 --> 23:32.247
Ak, uh, could you grab me
a La Croix ?

23:32.247 --> 23:34.124
You know where they are.

23:34.959 --> 23:38.630
I need relationship advice
from both you guys.

23:38.630 --> 23:41.965
Try spelling "Mississippi"
with your tongue.

23:41.965 --> 23:44.843
No. Not like that.
Like, real stuff.

23:45.594 --> 23:47.095
Ask me !

23:47.095 --> 23:50.642
Not only is my relationship
the longest, it's also grown.

23:50.642 --> 23:52.519
Don't think polyamory applies here, Ak.

23:52.519 --> 23:56.856
I can't reach the pamplemousse.
Aki, can you grab it, please ?

23:56.856 --> 23:59.025
You got thinner arms and it's jammed
at the back there.

23:59.025 --> 24:00.150
Seriously ?

24:00.150 --> 24:02.569
It's just like how do I know...

24:02.569 --> 24:04.863
...if I'm being too pushy
with Grace ?

24:04.863 --> 24:07.241
You know,
what if I was being led by Julien ?

24:07.659 --> 24:11.287
But now I'm leading too much
with Grace ?

24:11.287 --> 24:12.663
What, Obie ? I can't.

24:12.663 --> 24:15.375
Can you come over here ?
I can't hear you.

24:17.835 --> 24:19.796
- See I just don't want...
- I just heard my phone.

24:19.796 --> 24:21.547
Wait, what ?

24:22.465 --> 24:26.052
I don't want this thing
to be Goldilocks... you know ?

24:26.760 --> 24:30.515
Like, I'm too small with Julien
and now I'm too big with Grace.

24:30.973 --> 24:33.517
I want this relationship to work now.

24:33.517 --> 24:37.522
I don't want some future
relationship to work, you know ?

24:37.522 --> 24:39.815
How do you know
if you're doing too much

24:39.815 --> 24:41.234
or if you're doing enough ?

24:42.318 --> 24:43.986
Anyone ?

24:44.821 --> 24:47.573
Mone, this is gonna be the hottest
Kiss on the Lips party of all time.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.075
No cap.

24:49.576 --> 24:51.493
We got American Bar to cater !

24:51.493 --> 24:53.997
Mom's doing the champagne tower.

24:56.707 --> 24:58.960
Luna, what would you do ?

24:59.711 --> 25:01.337
Recast ?

25:01.337 --> 25:04.966
As promised, I'm here taking
your questions about love, loneliness,

25:04.966 --> 25:06.675
and the moments in between.

25:06.675 --> 25:09.596
Questions are open.
Oh, hot topic:

25:10.053 --> 25:14.182
"Monogamy vs. polyamory ?
Preference and why ?"

25:14.601 --> 25:17.145
I think my position is very clear.

25:18.563 --> 25:20.273
Why don't we ask Grace ?

25:20.273 --> 25:23.650
Well, I was raised in a pretty
traditional household,

25:23.650 --> 25:25.736
so, while I believe love is love,

25:25.736 --> 25:28.740
I've always been
a one-man type of gal.

25:29.364 --> 25:33.452
Okay. You heard it here first,
Grace Byron, resident monogamist.

25:33.994 --> 25:35.621
Riveting.

25:36.371 --> 25:40.210
Oh, six feet, please.
I don't trust the ventilation.

25:40.210 --> 25:42.545
Since you didn't want to introduce us,

25:42.545 --> 25:44.839
I was wondering if you could give me
Terrell's phone number ?

25:44.839 --> 25:46.548
He's not on IG or Snapchat.

25:46.548 --> 25:48.510
Probably because he blocked you ?

25:48.510 --> 25:51.554
What went down at the Deb Ball
was all my idea, not Z's.

25:51.554 --> 25:52.931
So if you want someone to hate...

25:52.931 --> 25:55.058
Right. Here's the thing,

25:55.058 --> 25:58.978
why give you his phone number when
he's just going to say no ?

25:58.978 --> 26:02.689
Haven't you heard I'm benevolent now ?
I'm sparing you pain.

26:04.775 --> 26:07.278
If she won't give it up,
we'll just have to take it.

26:07.278 --> 26:09.030
This comment's interesting.

26:09.030 --> 26:13.075
"Have you ever been interested
in someone who was unavailable ?"

26:13.535 --> 26:17.329
Trick question, is anyone
ever emotionally available ?

26:17.329 --> 26:20.958
Do dead men count ?
What ? No way I'm alone here.

26:20.958 --> 26:23.211
You're alone. Get used to it.

26:23.211 --> 26:26.548
No, I'm with her.
I've had a crush on River Phoenix

26:26.548 --> 26:30.008
ever since Aki made me watch
My Own Private Idaho. So...

26:30.718 --> 26:34.430
Grace ? You're quiet.
What about you ?

26:34.430 --> 26:36.890
Have you ever been into someone
who's unavailable ?

26:36.890 --> 26:40.854
Or have you met someone
when you're unavailable ?

26:42.480 --> 26:45.190
hy don't you share with the group ?

26:46.441 --> 26:48.527
Okay, I'll share.

26:48.945 --> 26:52.739
I recently met
this very attractive, married man.

26:53.282 --> 26:56.327
Nothing happened.
We just talked, but I'd be lying

26:56.327 --> 26:58.954
if I said I wasn't interested
in getting to know him better,

26:58.954 --> 27:01.915
even though I know
how wrong that would be.

27:01.915 --> 27:03.917
You need to stop that story.

27:03.917 --> 27:06.171
Affairs don't only affect you,
they destroy families.

27:06.171 --> 27:08.881
I thought after what your mom did,
you of all people, would know that.

27:08.881 --> 27:10.007
Monet.

27:10.007 --> 27:13.720
No. What you're doing is wrong,
and selfish, and entitled.

27:13.720 --> 27:17.264
- I haven't done anything.
- That's what everyone says.

27:18.725 --> 27:21.311
Oh, my god. Mone, are you okay ?

27:21.311 --> 27:25.063
I think my dad is having an affair.

27:25.063 --> 27:27.567
Anyone cheat on your mom ?
No way.

27:27.567 --> 27:29.694
I thought that they were
the perfect ship.

27:29.694 --> 27:33.031
But it turns out, they're a mess
like all of yours.

27:33.740 --> 27:36.910
That blind GG item is about my dad.
I know it.

27:36.910 --> 27:38.118
How ?

27:38.118 --> 27:41.831
He has been sneaking around,
and my mom is acting weird,

27:41.831 --> 27:46.752
so I followed him twice to a hotel.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.963
- Both times.
- Oh, honey.

27:48.963 --> 27:53.800
You say a word of this to anyone,
I'll have you exiled to Exeter.

27:57.137 --> 27:58.972
I need some vitamin D.

27:58.972 --> 28:01.226
I need to change my massage.

28:01.643 --> 28:03.435
I want a smoothie !

28:11.193 --> 28:12.862
I want fresh ginger tea.

28:12.862 --> 28:16.324
And when I say fresh ginger,
I mean make it yourself.

28:20.411 --> 28:21.954
What now ?

28:22.497 --> 28:26.417
Just watching our boyfriend entering
the building of Rex Huntington

28:26.417 --> 28:29.045
carrying a bag
of newly purchased sex toys !

28:29.753 --> 28:31.130
Julien was right.

28:31.130 --> 28:33.466
What, about the glass dildo
and the butt plugs ?

28:34.383 --> 28:36.802
Did Rex Huntington RSVP for tonight ?

28:36.802 --> 28:38.471
Of course.

28:40.973 --> 28:43.016
Julien said to talk to Aki outright,

28:43.016 --> 28:45.478
which is exactly what we're gonna do
tonight at the party.

28:49.231 --> 28:51.900
CelloistGraham:
Great Live. I hate this, but...

28:51.900 --> 28:54.320
I'm interested in getting
to know you too.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.407
Hi. I booked the relaxing massage,
but after the day I'm having...

28:58.407 --> 29:00.827
The day you're having ?

29:01.160 --> 29:04.621
Pretty sure I was the one
being waterboarded in the wellness pool.

29:05.248 --> 29:07.457
- Grace ?
- Give us a moment ?

29:09.711 --> 29:12.170
I don't care how you found out,
and I don't care...

29:12.170 --> 29:15.632
You definitely don't care about Obie.
I saw you hooking up with that rando.

29:15.632 --> 29:19.469
Matías isn't random. He's my ex.
My mother doesn't approve.

29:19.469 --> 29:22.639
I tried to end it, but...
It's complicated.

29:22.639 --> 29:25.017
It seems pretty simple to me.

29:25.017 --> 29:28.353
You're cheating on one of my best
friends. Either you're gonna tell him...

29:28.353 --> 29:30.731
Or what ? You'll tell him ?

29:30.731 --> 29:33.817
You think he'll believe you after
everything you put him through ?

29:33.817 --> 29:35.778
Making a false accusation like that

29:35.778 --> 29:38.156
could cost the little friendship
you have left.

29:38.156 --> 29:40.742
You think I'm just gonna sit by
and let you hurt him ?

29:40.742 --> 29:44.204
If you tell him,
you'll be breaking his heart again.

29:44.204 --> 29:47.623
How many times
are you gonna do that, Julien ?

29:47.623 --> 29:49.958
Besides, it's your word against mine,

29:49.958 --> 29:53.170
and your word
means nothing anymore.

30:11.814 --> 30:13.024
Shan !

30:17.779 --> 30:19.280
To Terrell:
Coming to my party ?

30:19.280 --> 30:21.573
I want to intro you
to a secret admirer.

30:21.573 --> 30:23.451
Shan ! Shan, no, don't !

30:24.159 --> 30:25.452
I'll be there.

30:25.787 --> 30:27.622
DELETE MESSAGES

30:50.269 --> 30:55.525
We're doing a four seas spa day
with Luna and Julien at 12:30.

31:01.905 --> 31:03.574
DELETE MESSAGE

31:28.641 --> 31:31.143
To Julien:
Matias Botello 3474225333

31:34.731 --> 31:36.064
DELETE MESSAGE

31:36.064 --> 31:39.861
Dating before Valentine's Day
is just a game of musical chairs.

31:39.861 --> 31:42.863
Seats swap, partners change,

31:43.323 --> 31:46.159
and options are eliminated.

31:49.912 --> 31:53.166
- What are you doing here ?
- I found a great date for us !

31:53.540 --> 31:56.252
The Kiss On the Lips party ?
Isn't that for kids ?

31:56.252 --> 31:58.713
Yup. What worse date is there ?

31:59.380 --> 32:04.636
Besides, your bestie Camille's gonna be
there since it's her daughter's party.

32:04.636 --> 32:08.556
Imagine her face seeing us dancing.
You do dance, don't you ?

32:08.556 --> 32:11.184
Very, very badly
and with no shame about it.

32:14.645 --> 32:16.521
Now that blind item.
Is it about my dad ?

32:17.106 --> 32:18.525
Could you excuse me a moment ?

32:18.525 --> 32:21.985
Only if it's to change
into something very un-festive.

32:26.282 --> 32:28.576
GossipGirl: Yes.
Monet: Do you know who with ?

32:38.253 --> 32:42.005
Monet: I know her.
What would you do if you were me ?

32:42.507 --> 32:44.300
GossipGirl:
Invite them all to your party ?

32:44.300 --> 32:47.136
Won't that be suspicious ?
Not if you invite the whole PTA.

32:48.804 --> 32:50.515
Let's break some fucking hearts then.

32:51.390 --> 32:54.268
- Okay, Mike, I'm in !
- Fuck yes !

32:55.143 --> 32:59.607
But word is this year,
there are a few unexpected players.

33:00.233 --> 33:03.236
So, where will you be
when the music stops ?

33:03.236 --> 33:05.279
Seated comfortably ?

33:05.279 --> 33:06.780
Or standing alone

33:06.780 --> 33:09.908
while everyone watches you
land straight on your ass ?

33:09.908 --> 33:12.244
There's, like,
no fucking service out here.

33:12.244 --> 33:14.413
The party is starting.
How long are we supposed to wait ?

33:14.413 --> 33:18.459
You're sure this is Pete's place ?
There no way Kim would come out here.

33:18.459 --> 33:21.296
Jes, Bianca.
Yeah, it's Staten Island.

33:22.504 --> 33:24.215
Fuck, it's cold !

33:39.063 --> 33:40.315
It's perfect.

33:40.315 --> 33:43.484
Wait until our special guest arrives,
it's what I do.

33:43.484 --> 33:45.528
You ? Where are the girls ?

33:45.528 --> 33:49.031
They were no-shows.
Someone had to step in.

33:49.031 --> 33:53.369
If you ask me, I think they always
planned to try and destroy you.

33:53.369 --> 33:56.622
- You owe me forever, bitch.
- Name it.

33:56.956 --> 33:59.458
I'll cash in when the time is right.

34:02.712 --> 34:06.591
When I said open the party to everyone,
I didn't mean everyone.

34:06.591 --> 34:10.677
It's a long story, but it's why
I insisted on low lighting. 'Kay ?

34:17.352 --> 34:19.019
You brought a chaperone ?

34:19.019 --> 34:21.773
Nice to see you too, Miss Barnes,
I told Zoya she could go

34:21.773 --> 34:24.400
so long as I saw with my own eyes
what it was.

34:24.400 --> 34:27.653
Which I thought was fair. So...
You can go now !

34:28.571 --> 34:30.989
Sure, in a little bit.

34:34.327 --> 34:38.330
- So, have you seen Terrell anywhere ?
- Not yet, but I'm on the lookout.

34:38.330 --> 34:41.292
This is literally the best party
I've ever been invited to.

34:41.292 --> 34:44.128
It's the only party
you've ever been invited to.

34:45.797 --> 34:47.714
JK ! You're welcome.

34:51.427 --> 34:53.304
Being liked is awful.

34:55.472 --> 34:58.810
At least your apple doesn't fall
far from that tree.

35:00.061 --> 35:05.107
I know, right ? She's amazing.
He doesn't deserve her.

35:08.111 --> 35:10.362
This is a great party, hon.

35:11.281 --> 35:14.951
So, our first Valentine's as an us.
Exciting, huh ?

35:15.451 --> 35:17.036
Yeah.

35:17.953 --> 35:20.539
Are we... looking for something ?

35:22.416 --> 35:26.003
Uh, yeah. The... caviar concierge.
He was here a second ago.

35:26.336 --> 35:29.464
You know what I could
really use right now, babe ?

35:30.091 --> 35:33.720
- Valentine's Vespers ?
- You know us so well.

35:37.306 --> 35:38.765
I can't believe he'd do this to us.

35:38.765 --> 35:40.350
You were literally gonna fuck Rex
two weeks ago !

35:40.350 --> 35:42.770
- Yeah, only 'cause you made me !
- Okay.

35:45.356 --> 35:46.773
Hey.

35:46.773 --> 35:49.611
Oh, my God !
They're not even hiding it !

35:50.195 --> 35:52.030
Oh, I almost forgot...

35:53.572 --> 35:56.700
Breakfast, flowers,
a Cameo from Chris Pratt...

35:56.700 --> 35:58.870
You've done enough.

35:58.870 --> 36:03.499
No, this is... this is your real...
your real gift.

36:09.630 --> 36:13.258
I thought maybe you could sew it
into your new uniform.

36:14.177 --> 36:18.972
Hear me out. I was thinking maybe
you could enroll at Constance.

36:20.140 --> 36:24.186
This is... a little late
in the year, isn't it ?

36:24.186 --> 36:25.480
Normally, yes.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.941
But, Leni Klum got that role
on that Amazon series in Budapest,

36:28.941 --> 36:32.862
andsince she's gonna be schooling
remotely for the rest of the year

36:32.862 --> 36:35.990
and it left this opening,
which I secured for you.

36:35.990 --> 36:38.408
Without talking to me ?

36:39.368 --> 36:41.536
- You hate it.
- No ! No, I love it.

36:41.536 --> 36:44.498
It's just,
I don't know if I can deal with...

36:45.291 --> 36:46.541
Julien ?

36:46.541 --> 36:49.546
Julien's the reason that you
don't wanna enroll at Constance ?

36:49.546 --> 36:50.964
I wasn't gonna say anything,

36:50.964 --> 36:52.715
but I think she's still trying
to come between us.

36:52.715 --> 36:56.344
Obie ! Grace ! I'd like you
to meet Matías Botello.

36:56.761 --> 36:59.179
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You, too.

36:59.596 --> 37:00.974
Nice to meet you...

37:00.974 --> 37:03.934
You look kind of familiar.
Have we met before ?

37:03.934 --> 37:06.312
Where would any of us have met ?

37:06.312 --> 37:08.939
I don't know. I'm just...
I'm really good with faces.

37:08.939 --> 37:11.317
He is. Really good.

37:11.317 --> 37:14.028
Are you that guy that spat
on Senator Byron ?

37:14.028 --> 37:15.697
You did what ?

37:15.697 --> 37:18.031
Yeah, what the fuck, man ?
Julien, this guy is...

37:18.031 --> 37:20.993
Is against capitalism, corporate greed,
and immigration policies

37:20.993 --> 37:23.745
that make Donald Trump
look like the Dalai Lama ?

37:23.745 --> 37:27.667
Can't disagree with that, can you,
Grace ? Seems she has a type !

37:27.667 --> 37:30.460
Obie, I'm thirsty.
Let's get a drink ?

37:36.843 --> 37:40.513
You know, this is way lower
than I ever expected from you.

37:41.681 --> 37:44.225
Stay out of my life, Julien.

37:54.611 --> 37:56.486
Telling you she doesn't like him,

37:56.486 --> 37:58.530
telling him
she doesn't know you.

37:58.530 --> 38:01.367
She told me Obie was temporary.

38:01.367 --> 38:05.913
I'm sorry, Matías,
for you and Obie.

38:06.914 --> 38:08.208
Two for me.

38:08.208 --> 38:11.168
Okay, maybe slow down a little bit ?
My dad's here.

38:11.168 --> 38:13.421
Why do you think I need this ?

38:13.421 --> 38:17.217
- Not this again.
- I've tried really hard not to...

38:19.384 --> 38:22.388
'Kay, we're moving past
what he did. Why can't you ?

38:22.388 --> 38:25.016
It's just a job. Sometimes people
do things that aren't necessarily...

38:25.016 --> 38:27.726
It's not about his job, Jesus !
Here.

38:28.393 --> 38:31.773
So, it's apparently somehow about you.
God, I'm so sick and tired

38:31.773 --> 38:34.149
of you constantly inserting your chaos
into my life, Shan !

38:34.149 --> 38:35.318
My chaos ?

38:35.318 --> 38:36.903
Yes, you know exactly
what I'm talking about !

38:36.903 --> 38:39.363
My family isn't some playground
for your attention-seeking games.

38:39.363 --> 38:41.533
- Back off !
- I'm just trying to help you see...

38:41.533 --> 38:44.827
Your help isn't wanted.
Not about this. Ever !

38:48.705 --> 38:51.584
What a liar you are,
Katherine Keller.

38:51.584 --> 38:55.588
We agreed to make this
an unsexy Valentine's, and look at you.

38:56.256 --> 38:58.383
At least you have to admit, I win.

38:58.383 --> 39:03.303
Being surrounded by our pubescent
overlords is as unsexy as it can get.

39:03.845 --> 39:07.100
Not so fast. I scheduled us
dual colonoscopies

39:07.100 --> 39:09.185
for St. Patrick's Day.

39:13.146 --> 39:16.067
- Can you excuse me for a moment ?
- Yeah.

39:31.415 --> 39:32.874
Monet.

39:32.874 --> 39:36.169
So, I showed, who is she ?

39:36.921 --> 39:38.088
Excuse me ?

39:38.088 --> 39:41.134
My secret admirer.
I got your text.

39:42.968 --> 39:46.764
You told to meet you
and that someone is into me here.

39:49.893 --> 39:53.104
- What the actual fuck ?
- So, there's no secret admirer ?

39:53.104 --> 39:55.523
I think I can help answer that.
Mm, yeah.

39:55.523 --> 39:59.694
And let's welcome to Dumbo Hall,
Charli XCX !

39:59.694 --> 40:02.488
- Shouldn't I just go ?
- Not yet.

40:02.488 --> 40:06.366
You want her to react ?
Follow my lead.

41:10.306 --> 41:12.350
Look who's here ! My twink prince !

41:12.350 --> 41:14.560
Yeah, of course Rex is here.
He goes to our school.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.687
I'm more interested
in what he does after.

41:16.687 --> 41:20.774
- Squash at the Harvard Club ?
- Squash was definitely involved !

41:20.774 --> 41:23.278
- What are you guys talking about ?
- We know about you two.

41:23.278 --> 41:25.988
- We saw everything.
- Everything ?

41:26.364 --> 41:29.616
- What exactly do you think you saw ?
- We saw you go to the doctor.

41:29.951 --> 41:32.036
- And pick up the dick scurvy.
- Descovy.

41:32.036 --> 41:34.581
Jesus ! Then to The Pleasure Chest

41:34.581 --> 41:37.958
to buy a chest full of pleasure
for your secret rendezvous !

41:37.958 --> 41:39.252
You followed me ?

41:39.252 --> 41:41.462
It's not my fault he texted you
when I had your phone !

41:41.462 --> 41:43.922
I had no choice but to look,
and once I did, I had to see more !

41:43.922 --> 41:45.257
Just be honest with us.

41:45.257 --> 41:47.802
We can get through anything
if we're honest with each other.

41:47.802 --> 41:50.430
Oh, from the two people
who secretly tailed me,

41:50.430 --> 41:53.850
violated my privacy, and tried to break
into my phone ?

41:53.850 --> 41:56.477
Is that the kind of honesty
you mean ?

41:56.810 --> 41:59.189
Yeah, that's what I fucking thought.

42:01.858 --> 42:03.609
What are you laughing at ?

42:03.609 --> 42:07.321
How much you just fucked this all up.
Those toys weren't for me.

42:07.321 --> 42:09.990
They were for him. For you.

42:23.087 --> 42:24.714
Excuse me.

42:29.593 --> 42:31.887
What the hell are you doing here ?

42:31.887 --> 42:35.225
I was invited,
I thought this was part of the deal.

42:35.225 --> 42:38.728
It is not. If anyone sees you,
it could be the end of the deal.

42:38.728 --> 42:42.147
Dad ! Have you no sense
of decency or discretion ?

42:42.147 --> 42:44.691
- What are you talking about, huh ?
- I know who she is.

42:44.691 --> 42:47.612
- You do ?
- Yes. I invited you here.

42:49.322 --> 42:52.157
Monet Makeda de Haan.
This is not the time or the place.

42:52.157 --> 42:55.661
I can't think of a better time or place
to expose that dad's having an affair.

42:55.661 --> 42:59.207
- Jennifer here is his mistress.
- No, she's not.

42:59.207 --> 43:01.083
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not.

43:01.083 --> 43:03.920
- Mom, yes, she is. I...
- No, she is not...

43:05.880 --> 43:07.924
She's both of ours.

43:27.193 --> 43:28.820
Zoya, wait !

43:28.820 --> 43:31.280
So, this is what you wanted ?
It was never about my dad.

43:31.280 --> 43:34.033
You just wanted to get with the only guy
that I've been into since Obie.

43:34.033 --> 43:37.787
That's not it. I've just been
a little messed up lately...

43:37.787 --> 43:39.663
And you wanted me to feel
as miserable as you do ?

43:39.663 --> 43:42.333
Well, maybe I'm miserable
because I'm keeping a secret !

43:42.333 --> 43:44.502
A secret about what ?

43:44.502 --> 43:46.546
You know what ? Forget it.
Go talk to your fucking dad.

43:46.546 --> 43:48.548
Talk to him about what, Shan ?

43:48.548 --> 43:50.507
Or is this just another deflection
in a long line of...

43:50.507 --> 43:55.054
Your dad didn't buy your apartment,
Dirty Davis Calloway did.

43:55.054 --> 43:58.307
And your dad has been lying to you
and Julien about it

43:58.307 --> 44:00.185
ever since it happened.

44:01.435 --> 44:02.854
I'm s...

44:14.657 --> 44:17.994
Grace. We need to talk.
U- h, you need to back up bro.

44:18.411 --> 44:20.955
Nobody needs to talk to anybody.

44:22.414 --> 44:24.833
Oh, good, they're here.

44:24.833 --> 44:27.295
You did this ?
My brother and my mom ?

44:27.295 --> 44:30.465
- I knew Matías wouldn't be enough.
- Enough for what ?

44:32.342 --> 44:34.801
- Is it true ?
- What ?

44:34.801 --> 44:37.639
Did Davis Calloway buy
our apartment ?

44:37.639 --> 44:39.932
Z, it's complicated, let me explain.

44:39.932 --> 44:44.020
What goes on between your father
and me remains between us.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.022
And whoever else
you share it with apparently.

44:46.022 --> 44:48.774
We don't... share her.

44:48.774 --> 44:51.944
So, what do you do ? You just sit there
and watch them go at it t...

44:51.944 --> 44:54.613
Your privilege has afforded you
the ability

44:54.613 --> 44:58.618
to live your life s a proud, out,
young Black woman

44:58.618 --> 45:01.246
in a country where none
of those things come easily,

45:01.246 --> 45:03.873
but they come easily for you
because of me.

45:03.873 --> 45:08.794
So, you have no right to question
how your father and I live our lives,

45:08.794 --> 45:14.341
just like we have never
questioned how you live yours.

45:21.516 --> 45:27.856
My only regret is that you chose
a public place to make a mess.

45:29.274 --> 45:34.571
But that is what
you are growing into. A mess.

45:39.075 --> 45:40.702
Why on earth was I summoned here ?

45:40.702 --> 45:43.371
We took the plane and everything
to come to a party ?

45:43.371 --> 45:46.457
- Mom, I...
- And what are you doing here ?

45:46.457 --> 45:49.752
- He's your daughter's secret boyfriend.
- No, he's not.

45:49.752 --> 45:52.462
- I think you're confused.
- Yeah, exactly. Grace would never...

45:52.462 --> 45:56.467
- I told you to end it with him.
- I did ! Tell her.

45:56.926 --> 45:58.635
This is all a misunderstanding.

45:58.635 --> 46:03.390
After a deep dive of Grace's socials
with other Grammers' geotags,

46:03.390 --> 46:07.270
last week, when she was allegedly
on the campaign trail with you,

46:07.270 --> 46:10.230
she was also somehow at Tacombi.

46:10.230 --> 46:14.736
Ew, by the way.
And stayed at The Crosby.

46:15.069 --> 46:17.487
Last week ?
You said you were with your mom.

46:17.487 --> 46:19.365
You told me you were with Obie.

46:19.365 --> 46:21.534
She wasn't.
Luna is wrong.

46:21.534 --> 46:24.328
She has the wrong dates,
the wrong information.

46:24.328 --> 46:27.539
George, the GM of The Crosby,
begs to disagree.

46:27.539 --> 46:29.751
- Shall I call him ?
- This is getting out of hand.

46:29.751 --> 46:31.668
- Are you seeing a third person ?
- No.

46:31.668 --> 46:35.297
Jake, when you came to town last
week for your interview with Columbia,

46:35.297 --> 46:38.676
you stayed at The Crosby,
didn't you ?

46:38.676 --> 46:41.804
I paid for it. And you promised
this wouldn't happen again.

46:41.804 --> 46:43.680
Can we please
not talk about this here ?

46:43.680 --> 46:45.682
- Oh, my God !
- Your brother ?

46:45.682 --> 46:47.560
We didn't mean to.

46:50.270 --> 46:51.939
- Wait, Grace.
- Grace, wait.

46:51.939 --> 46:53.650
Let's go.

46:56.610 --> 46:59.196
Even I didn't see
that twincest coming.

46:59.196 --> 47:02.366
- I hope you're happy.
- You think I wanted this ?

47:11.584 --> 47:16.964
- I thought you left.
- Oh, well, you thought wrong again.

47:18.006 --> 47:23.220
Okay, in hindsight, we may not
have gone about this in the best way.

47:23.220 --> 47:24.597
You think ?

47:24.597 --> 47:28.308
Okay, you have to admit
you've been withholding. I mean...

47:28.850 --> 47:32.145
No, I know you've been wanting me
to bottom, and I want to.

47:32.145 --> 47:38.777
I've just been scared.
It's new to me, and I feel vulnerable.

47:38.777 --> 47:43.408
And I got nervous, and I got
embarrassed for getting so nervous.

47:43.867 --> 47:49.371
So, I went to Rex for advice and
guidance, and he told me to practice.

47:49.371 --> 47:53.209
And now, I'm so wildly
uncomfortable telling you this.

47:53.793 --> 47:55.502
And the PrEP ?

47:55.502 --> 47:58.923
You're Max Wolfe.
We haven't had that conversation yet.

47:58.923 --> 48:00.925
He's right. We haven't.

48:02.342 --> 48:05.722
You know the only people
I wanna be with is both of you.

48:08.640 --> 48:12.144
- You never said that as a rule.
- Consider it said and done.

48:12.144 --> 48:15.939
Yeah, look, as for the other thing ?
We're happy to wait.

48:16.481 --> 48:18.400
I mean, there's no rush.

48:18.818 --> 48:21.695
I don't wanna wait.
I'm ready !

48:24.197 --> 48:26.034
Camille de Haan's a cuck queen !

48:26.034 --> 48:29.453
- Don't kink shame !
- I'm not ! It's fucking hot !

48:29.453 --> 48:31.789
I feel strangely bad for Monet.

48:31.789 --> 48:34.625
Well, yeah, 'cause her mom called her
out in public ?

48:34.625 --> 48:36.835
This'll be on Gossip Girl in minutes.

48:36.835 --> 48:39.379
At least our shame's only
on repeat our heads.

48:39.379 --> 48:42.466
Theirs is one click away forever.

48:44.219 --> 48:46.678
You know, I also feel
somehow responsible.

48:46.678 --> 48:50.182
No. Her parents are responsible
for Monet, not you.

48:50.182 --> 48:52.935
I always thought the problem
was the kids' entitlement,

48:52.935 --> 48:55.437
but that comes from somewhere else.

48:55.437 --> 48:57.147
The parents are the true monsters.

48:57.147 --> 48:58.983
The kids are simply
modeling their behavior.

48:58.983 --> 49:01.735
But I don't know why it's taken me
so long to really see that.

49:01.735 --> 49:06.699
Oh, you just needed a good teacher
to point it out. I'll go get the coats ?

49:21.256 --> 49:23.715
Zoya, please ! I can explain.

49:24.258 --> 49:27.177
Explain what ? What's going on ?
Is this about the Grace thing ?

49:27.177 --> 49:29.263
You wanna tell her or should I ?

49:31.515 --> 49:35.143
I told you I was going to break
some hearts tonight.

49:35.143 --> 49:39.314
But what I have to share
isn't exactly a lovers quarrel.

49:39.314 --> 49:44.444
They say nothing is stronger than the
bond between a father and a daughter.

49:44.821 --> 49:46.613
But we have it confirmed

49:46.613 --> 49:50.952
that Nicholas Lott has committed
the ultimate betrayal.

49:51.368 --> 49:55.582
He made a deal with a devil
known as Davis Calloway.

49:56.207 --> 50:00.795
Nothing worse than taking blood money
to keep up with the Joneses.

50:01.253 --> 50:03.464
Tell me this isn't true.

50:10.263 --> 50:11.973
Heavy is the crown ?

50:11.973 --> 50:14.475
No wonder Julien shaved her head.

50:15.893 --> 50:19.272
I could've made my parents
a New York Post story.

50:19.272 --> 50:22.317
It could've ruined their careers.

50:22.317 --> 50:26.362
And for what ? I mean...
They're just having fun.

50:26.362 --> 50:30.575
Don't ask me. I haven't even seen
my parents since last summer.

50:33.952 --> 50:36.663
What if I don't wanna be loved ?

50:37.205 --> 50:42.920
Love only exposes you to trouble.
Isn't it better to hate and be hated ?

50:43.962 --> 50:46.131
No. Not at all.

50:47.300 --> 50:51.678
Fuck, I wanna be loved.

50:52.472 --> 50:55.600
Me, too. Me fucking too.

50:56.975 --> 50:59.978
There's no such thing as a love story.

51:00.355 --> 51:02.357
Because for it to be a story,

51:02.357 --> 51:06.027
it would have to have a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

51:23.419 --> 51:25.338
- You ready ?
- Yes.

51:25.338 --> 51:28.840
And love doesn't end. It changes.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.718
It grows.

51:32.804 --> 51:36.098
It dims, and it dies.

51:37.976 --> 51:41.479
But even then, it's never over.

51:43.565 --> 51:48.319
It lives in your shadows, waiting
to wake you in the middle of the night.

51:49.069 --> 51:51.489
Zoya ? Julien ?

51:51.489 --> 51:55.284
...to tap you on your shoulder
when you least expect it.

51:56.451 --> 51:59.706
A splinter you can never get out.

52:01.498 --> 52:04.460
- Oh, baby. I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

52:19.766 --> 52:23.395
- I'm so glad you called.
- I'm so glad you answered.

52:24.104 --> 52:27.483
I had an absolutely horrible night,

52:27.483 --> 52:29.527
and the only person that I wanted
to talk to about it

52:29.527 --> 52:31.945
was someone that I
don't know at all.

52:31.945 --> 52:35.574
Is that okay ? I need someone
who doesn't know

52:35.574 --> 52:37.618
about all of the shit
that I've been dealing with.

52:37.618 --> 52:41.456
Somebody brand new.
Could you be that person ?

52:43.415 --> 52:46.543
- I'm Graham.
- Julien.

52:46.543 --> 52:49.797
Each love is a crime that haunts us,

52:49.797 --> 52:52.799
and we pile up crimes as we go.

52:56.345 --> 53:01.226
So much for our non-romantic,
completely unsexy Valentine's Day.

53:02.559 --> 53:05.355
- I'll get you some water.
- 'Kay.

53:06.355 --> 53:12.904
And while we tell ourselves we'll never
get caught, we know we always will.

53:12.904 --> 53:16.950
It's only a matter of time
till we commit our next crime.

53:16.950 --> 53:21.704
And this one, we swear,
