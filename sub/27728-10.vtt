00:00.992 --> 00:02.992
<i>Previously on</i> Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.017 --> 00:05.534
- Why?
- I ran out of reasons not to.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.366
It'll never happen again.

00:07.391 --> 00:09.047
- What are you doing?
- There's something in my boot.

00:09.072 --> 00:10.082
That's Maria's necklace.

00:10.107 --> 00:11.594
I want to know who you are, Guerin.

00:11.619 --> 00:12.761
Do you want to know who I am?

00:12.786 --> 00:13.857
Or do you want to know what I am?

00:13.882 --> 00:15.715
These are the letters my dad
wrote when he was dying.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.116
My dad's alien Rosetta stone.

00:17.141 --> 00:18.806
It's somewhere in all this crazy.

00:18.831 --> 00:20.027
Master Sergeant Manes gave me

00:20.052 --> 00:21.662
this file. All 14 of them

00:21.687 --> 00:23.478
killed by a mysterious handprint.

00:23.503 --> 00:26.179
We are investigating an
alien serial killer.

00:26.204 --> 00:27.651
Rosa wasn't the only person murdered.

00:27.676 --> 00:28.915
I think there's a fourth alien.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.454
My father didn't die of a brain tumor.

00:30.479 --> 00:31.910
I need to talk to my mom.

00:31.935 --> 00:33.280
I don't know why I
would have killed her.

00:33.305 --> 00:34.302
If you don't know why,

00:34.327 --> 00:35.948
how can you guarantee
it won't happen again?

00:35.973 --> 00:37.283
I was trying to create a serum

00:37.308 --> 00:38.402
that would mute your powers,

00:38.427 --> 00:40.244
but instead, it is killing Isobel.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.204
You can create the antidote.

00:42.229 --> 00:44.386
These pods are our key
to keeping Isobel alive,

00:44.411 --> 00:45.935
in stasis, while we work.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.709
Last time we came out of those
pods, we lost our memories.

00:47.734 --> 00:49.754
What if she comes out,
she doesn't remember us?

00:49.779 --> 00:52.173
My wife is missing.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:17.762 --> 01:19.088
Okay.

01:19.682 --> 01:20.867
Hey.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.340
It's okay. It's okay.

01:23.365 --> 01:26.124
All right? Do you remember anything?

01:28.448 --> 01:31.187
Hey, it's just me, okay? It's just me.

01:31.212 --> 01:32.755
Do you remember me?

01:34.333 --> 01:35.584
Max.

01:46.969 --> 01:48.403
Did you find a cure?

01:51.816 --> 01:53.557
We're about to find out.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.324
Mom is gonna smother
you at Thanksgiving.

02:08.350 --> 02:09.826
Just let her, okay?

02:09.851 --> 02:11.319
These last few weeks
have been hard on her.

02:11.344 --> 02:12.393
What?

02:12.789 --> 02:14.171
Are you serious?

02:14.196 --> 02:15.561
He's still president?

02:15.586 --> 02:17.230
I'm not putting you
back in a pod, Isobel.

02:17.255 --> 02:19.010
How is that even possible?

02:19.035 --> 02:21.074
Okay.

02:21.465 --> 02:22.738
Looks like all normal activity

02:22.763 --> 02:24.599
has returned to your mitochondrial DNA.

02:24.925 --> 02:26.641
And the bad news?

02:26.975 --> 02:28.853
Drugs have side effects.

02:28.885 --> 02:31.147
I mean, this is bathtub gin,
and anything can happen.

02:31.362 --> 02:33.961
Kyle is going to examine
you when he can,

02:33.986 --> 02:35.787
but everything seems stable.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.028
She's an alien again.

02:42.115 --> 02:43.190
I'll give you two some time.

02:45.829 --> 02:47.212
Thank you...

02:47.433 --> 02:48.558
Liz.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.749
Thank you for everything.

02:57.226 --> 02:58.915
"Thank you, Liz.

02:58.940 --> 03:00.339
"For everything.

03:01.159 --> 03:02.819
"For your gentle caress,

03:02.844 --> 03:04.359
"for drowning me

03:04.384 --> 03:06.195
"in the sweet chocolate
depth of your eyes,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.539
for your lingering
scent of desert rose."

03:08.564 --> 03:10.221
Whoa, what?

03:10.543 --> 03:11.867
Come on.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.023
I forgot what it's
like to see you happy.

03:18.875 --> 03:19.960
Hey.

03:20.073 --> 03:22.656
Hey. You-you don't have to leave.

03:23.698 --> 03:26.244
I do.

03:26.553 --> 03:27.589
I've forgiven you,

03:27.614 --> 03:29.252
but Isobel is still the
girl who killed my sister,

03:29.277 --> 03:31.586
and I just gave her her powers back.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.126
And I keep thinking...

03:33.852 --> 03:35.252
It's hard for me.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.179
Anyway,

03:37.204 --> 03:39.504
things are pretty crazy at the hospital.

03:39.529 --> 03:41.242
The grant just got announced

03:41.267 --> 03:42.683
for the stem cell study,

03:43.176 --> 03:44.899
and there have been some threats.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.107
I heard about the protests.

03:46.132 --> 03:48.307
Pushing boundaries makes
small minds very angry.

03:48.332 --> 03:49.440
But now that I finished the antidote,

03:49.465 --> 03:51.394
I have to get back to
focusing on humans.

03:51.419 --> 03:52.666
You, on the other hand...

03:52.691 --> 03:54.334
When are you gonna tell Isobel
about the fourth alien?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.121
I don't know.

03:56.434 --> 03:58.901
Figured I'd give her a day
to get her life back.

03:59.410 --> 04:00.475
In the meantime,

04:00.500 --> 04:02.905
I got to do my job and try
and catch the bastard.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.532
Be safe, Max.

04:10.348 --> 04:12.039
Cameron.

04:12.157 --> 04:13.291
Kyle told her. She knows everything.

04:13.316 --> 04:15.167
Oh, she's the one who
discovered the serial killer

04:15.192 --> 04:16.711
and the cover-up.

04:16.903 --> 04:18.296
Okay.

04:18.321 --> 04:19.922
You go do your job.

04:19.947 --> 04:21.966
I'm gonna go do mine.

04:24.190 --> 04:25.606
Keep me posted.

04:25.631 --> 04:28.473
Okay.

04:32.384 --> 04:35.176
- Off duty?
- Yeah, well, um,

04:35.202 --> 04:36.726
hunting an alien murderer

04:36.751 --> 04:39.025
isn't exactly official police business.

04:39.708 --> 04:41.610
You okay?

04:42.446 --> 04:44.947
I can erase your mind if you
regret what you know now.

04:44.972 --> 04:46.033
What? You can do that?

04:46.058 --> 04:47.658
No, but that would be pretty cool.

04:48.212 --> 04:49.952
Look, ask whatever you want.

04:50.179 --> 04:51.922
So, the three of you
were found together,

04:51.947 --> 04:54.415
but why were Max and
Isobel adopted separately?

04:54.440 --> 04:57.376
I just told you I survived a UFO crash.

04:57.596 --> 05:00.158
I gestated in a pod for half
a century, and I hatched.

05:00.183 --> 05:02.923
And you want to know about
my family problems?

05:03.343 --> 05:05.468
Look, I've known about
alien stuff for months.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.344
I want to know about you.

05:11.249 --> 05:13.830
The Evanses came into
the group home one day

05:14.634 --> 05:17.168
to adopt one kid, and they adopted two.

05:17.622 --> 05:19.009
They're good people.

05:19.090 --> 05:20.900
Maybe I just smelled like trouble.

05:21.915 --> 05:23.924
- Where'd you go after that?
- The system.

05:23.949 --> 05:27.686
First, uh, it was a couple of
angry meth heads in Albuquerque,

05:27.711 --> 05:30.660
and then a violent drunk
in, uh, in Santa Fe.

05:30.685 --> 05:33.188
I was 11 when I got
sent back to Roswell.

05:33.213 --> 05:36.998
Fundamentalist religious freaks.

05:37.094 --> 05:38.377
After that, I'd take

05:38.402 --> 05:40.126
an angry addict any day.

05:41.756 --> 05:43.797
But it did bring me
back to Max and Isobel.

05:43.822 --> 05:45.874
And I was just, uh...

05:48.165 --> 05:49.803
I was really relieved.

05:52.459 --> 05:54.225
They had an easier time.

05:58.069 --> 06:00.356
I showed you mine, now
you show me yours.

06:01.087 --> 06:02.733
How'd you know about me?

06:03.018 --> 06:04.713
Massive government conspiracy.

06:09.788 --> 06:11.546
Here's what I've learned, Evans.

06:11.571 --> 06:12.962
14 phony autopsies,

06:12.987 --> 06:15.204
all reeking of government cover-up.

06:15.392 --> 06:18.554
My contacts suggested
that the real autopsies

06:18.579 --> 06:20.309
have been destroyed, but I think...

06:20.334 --> 06:22.628
Cam, aren't we skipping a step here?

06:24.229 --> 06:26.396
Oh, you mean the part
where I gasp and I faint

06:26.421 --> 06:28.054
because you're an alien?

06:28.254 --> 06:31.647
Or the part where I hate you
for lying to me for years?

06:31.672 --> 06:33.387
Or the part where I ask
if I should be worried

06:33.412 --> 06:37.100
about some freaky, interplanetary STDs?

06:37.125 --> 06:40.563
Cameron, I can't apologize for
trying to protect my family.

06:41.117 --> 06:42.867
We've had this secret our whole lives.

06:43.610 --> 06:46.985
But I don't like lying to you.

06:47.010 --> 06:49.029
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.141
Can we go chase bad guys now?

06:54.166 --> 06:56.119
Find our fourth alien?

06:59.324 --> 07:01.800
And were you close with Dad's doctors?

07:02.291 --> 07:04.503
Did you ever get a second
opinion after his diagnosis?

07:04.528 --> 07:07.362
I know you pulled your father's
medical records last week.

07:07.847 --> 07:09.508
Why don't you tell me what's going on.

07:09.533 --> 07:11.570
Dad had a CT scan after
his bike accident

07:11.595 --> 07:13.393
on Valentine's Day, 2014.

07:13.418 --> 07:14.985
- Mm-hmm.
- No abnormalities.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.780
By March 1, there's a tumor so big

07:16.805 --> 07:19.189
you can barely see where it
ends and the brain begins.

07:19.214 --> 07:21.228
The oncologist said the
cancer was accelerated.

07:21.253 --> 07:24.418
They thought it was due to
some environmental exposure.

07:24.443 --> 07:25.811
You're a cop, Mom.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.076
You didn't think to question that?

07:27.101 --> 07:29.703
I saw the tumor on his scans, Kyle.

07:29.728 --> 07:31.987
I watched your father
disappear into himself

07:32.012 --> 07:33.495
in a matter of days.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.436
What was I supposed to do,
open up a murder investigation

07:35.461 --> 07:36.833
over cancer?

07:38.877 --> 07:39.916
I'm sorry.

07:39.941 --> 07:42.087
I wish there was something, anything

07:42.112 --> 07:44.037
I could have done.

07:44.856 --> 07:46.456
But there was nothing.

07:59.701 --> 08:01.769
So, this is my big secret.

08:04.187 --> 08:06.005
You're building something?

08:06.795 --> 08:10.402
Uh... trying to.

08:10.427 --> 08:13.777
It's like trying to bring a T.
Rrex back to life

08:13.802 --> 08:16.222
with a couple scraps of bone.

08:17.732 --> 08:19.362
Why are you showing me this, Guerin?

08:19.387 --> 08:20.528
I just told you that my family's

08:20.553 --> 08:22.414
been targeting yours for generations.

08:22.577 --> 08:25.042
I've been sick of secrets
for a long time now.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.212
And if anyone's gonna destroy me...

08:29.817 --> 08:31.549
might as well be you.

08:38.639 --> 08:40.474
No one's ever seen this before.

08:52.835 --> 08:54.864
I'm pretty sure it's a console.

08:54.889 --> 08:56.878
The ship's central control panel.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.819
I think it's the key to everything.

08:59.143 --> 09:00.910
I think it's my only way out.

09:07.621 --> 09:10.099
Oh, karaoke's not till Saturday night,

09:10.124 --> 09:12.457
but for you, I can make an exception.

09:12.482 --> 09:15.199
Yeah, no. Evans doesn't sing.

09:15.224 --> 09:16.844
It's kind of a thing.

09:16.869 --> 09:18.136
Oh.

09:20.244 --> 09:22.140
Are you fricking kidding me?

09:22.907 --> 09:24.215
I-I appreciate the offer,

09:24.240 --> 09:26.224
but we're actually here
on police business.

09:26.748 --> 09:28.647
Do you recognize this?

09:29.108 --> 09:30.787
- That's my door stamp.
- Yeah.

09:30.812 --> 09:32.830
There have been a few
unexplained deaths.

09:32.974 --> 09:34.727
One link between all of the victims

09:34.752 --> 09:37.281
is that they had that stamp on
their wrists when they died.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.604
Oh. We only stamp on Ranchero Night.

09:40.629 --> 09:42.029
Twice a month, we open our doors

09:42.054 --> 09:44.703
to people who need free
meals, live music.

09:44.728 --> 09:45.951
Mom started it.

09:46.571 --> 09:49.265
Are there any suspicious characters?

09:49.290 --> 09:51.935
- Addicts? Vagrants?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.422
But it's a judge-free zone.

09:53.447 --> 09:55.424
Maybe check out Racist Hank?

09:55.449 --> 09:56.758
Hank Gibbons?

09:56.791 --> 09:58.052
His band has been the live music

09:58.077 --> 09:59.576
on Ranchero Night since we were kids.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.444
Well, that seems a little
off-brand for him.

10:01.469 --> 10:03.474
Well, they're terrible,
so they play for free.

10:03.499 --> 10:04.638
'Cause they're terrible.

10:06.710 --> 10:07.987
You know where we can find him?

10:08.012 --> 10:09.395
Yeah, uh, same place he's been

10:09.420 --> 10:11.425
since his BFF, Racist
Wyatt, got locked up.

10:11.450 --> 10:13.484
He's, uh...

10:36.122 --> 10:37.715
Hi.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.802
Oh, baby, I missed you.

10:43.627 --> 10:45.571
Listen, Noah, there are some
things that I have to tell you,

10:45.596 --> 10:47.280
so...

10:48.277 --> 10:49.853
I think you should sit down.

10:54.077 --> 10:55.526
What are you doing?

10:55.551 --> 10:56.901
I don't know.

10:58.037 --> 11:00.028
I saw you in an egg, so I
freaked out and bought a gun.

11:00.053 --> 11:02.041
I don't... I don't... I
don't even want a gun.

11:02.066 --> 11:03.448
But I'm married to an egg person.

11:03.473 --> 11:04.734
Noah,

11:05.317 --> 11:07.056
could you put down the gun?

11:07.081 --> 11:08.372
Baby,

11:09.958 --> 11:12.042
I come in peace.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.574
So the egg froze you while
Liz Ortecho found a way

11:24.599 --> 11:26.203
to turn you back into an alien

11:26.228 --> 11:27.370
after you tried to turn yourself human

11:27.395 --> 11:28.603
so that you wouldn't black out

11:28.628 --> 11:30.553
and murder people with your magic hands.

11:30.578 --> 11:33.925
I really prefer "pod" to "egg."

11:36.500 --> 11:38.777
Where are you from?

11:40.194 --> 11:41.904
We don't know.

11:42.757 --> 11:44.783
So, Max and Michael, too.

11:44.808 --> 11:45.862
Oh, God.

11:45.887 --> 11:47.056
They're cowboys.

11:47.081 --> 11:47.875
And aliens.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.504
Cowboys and aliens.

11:49.529 --> 11:51.366
It's against the laws
of nature, Isobel. I...

11:51.391 --> 11:52.791
I know.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.180
Did you get in my head?

11:55.205 --> 11:56.555
Did you influence me? Did you...

11:56.580 --> 11:57.962
Did you make me love you?

11:58.238 --> 11:59.570
Did I even choose this sweater?

11:59.595 --> 12:01.300
God, Noah, no.

12:02.954 --> 12:04.622
I would never choose that sweater.

12:04.647 --> 12:05.371
Wow.

12:05.397 --> 12:08.259
And I've never used my
abilities on you, Noah.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.558
Am I just a cover for you?

12:10.583 --> 12:12.101
No.

12:13.890 --> 12:15.688
Noah, I love you.

12:16.406 --> 12:18.268
You're kind

12:18.292 --> 12:19.325
and you're smart

12:19.350 --> 12:22.265
and you are so... sexy.

12:22.290 --> 12:24.531
Sometimes I literally just want to fuse

12:24.556 --> 12:26.270
my skin into yours.

12:26.295 --> 12:27.517
Is that a thing you can do?

12:27.542 --> 12:29.033
No.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.081
I love you,

12:33.539 --> 12:34.833
Noah.

12:42.697 --> 12:44.194
I love you, too.

12:48.456 --> 12:49.992
Mm.

12:51.697 --> 12:54.311
I can't believe I've literally
been probed by an alien.

12:56.874 --> 12:58.607
What happened between Dad and Manes?

12:58.632 --> 12:59.589
They were friends.

12:59.614 --> 13:01.402
Their relationship didn't sour

13:01.427 --> 13:02.735
till you were a teenager.

13:02.760 --> 13:03.821
Do you know why?

13:04.167 --> 13:06.239
Jim said Jesse had no code.

13:06.372 --> 13:07.491
He always said that.

13:07.516 --> 13:08.297
What he meant was

13:08.322 --> 13:10.864
Jesse had a different code.

13:11.714 --> 13:14.769
Your father wasn't really
fit to judge, in the end.

13:16.710 --> 13:18.418
He cheated on me.

13:19.964 --> 13:22.588
Once with a girl half his age.

13:24.247 --> 13:25.999
She was his daughter.

13:26.417 --> 13:27.690
What?

13:27.715 --> 13:29.013
Rosa Ortecho.

13:29.950 --> 13:31.122
Dad wasn't sleeping with her.

13:31.147 --> 13:32.742
She was his daughter.

13:32.767 --> 13:34.486
He was cheating with her mother.

13:34.511 --> 13:37.228
I saw letters he wrote her

13:37.835 --> 13:40.692
while he was helping her get clean.

13:40.717 --> 13:42.734
He was being a good dad.

13:42.759 --> 13:45.029
Yeah.

13:45.424 --> 13:47.132
Yeah, that was the code.

13:47.288 --> 13:49.271
The unbreakable moral line.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.535
Protect your children at all costs.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.923
Dad's letters.

14:05.948 --> 14:07.272
He wrote them for you.

14:07.297 --> 14:09.386
I've pored over them countless times,

14:09.411 --> 14:11.251
seeking comfort,

14:11.300 --> 14:12.656
a reason,

14:12.681 --> 14:13.932
maybe a clue.

14:15.032 --> 14:16.560
You should have them.

14:20.795 --> 14:22.232
You built this thing?

14:22.257 --> 14:23.274
Sort of.

14:23.299 --> 14:26.068
It kind of builds itself.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.338
Pieces want to be together.

14:28.363 --> 14:30.282
What do you mean they want to be?

14:32.320 --> 14:33.878
When they fit,

14:34.129 --> 14:36.402
the molecules knit together on contact.

14:38.368 --> 14:40.042
It's like it was never broken at all.

14:40.067 --> 14:42.743
If I can find the rest, I can
attach this to a vehicle

14:42.767 --> 14:44.412
- and...
- A vehicle?

14:45.681 --> 14:47.340
You're trying to leave.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.676
The planet.

14:54.245 --> 14:55.932
I, uh...

14:56.300 --> 14:58.185
I think I need a little time

14:58.214 --> 15:00.344
to process all of this.

15:00.369 --> 15:02.360
Um, the storm's getting closer

15:02.385 --> 15:04.315
and I don't really want to
get snowed in here, so...

15:04.340 --> 15:06.276
let's just talk later, okay?

15:30.747 --> 15:32.329
Yeah,

15:32.354 --> 15:33.595
all yours.

15:36.064 --> 15:39.313
Why don't you tell us
about last Cinco de Mayo.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.019
Did you go straight home?

15:41.139 --> 15:43.354
I was arrested last Cinco de Mayo.

15:43.379 --> 15:44.940
On a drunk and disorderly.

15:44.970 --> 15:46.178
But you were never processed.

15:46.203 --> 15:48.360
Wyatt Long's dad saved your ass.

15:48.385 --> 15:50.237
So, did you go straight home?

15:51.562 --> 15:53.330
Is this about Carla?

15:56.126 --> 16:00.060
Cinco de Mayo was the last
time I ever saw Carla here.

16:00.207 --> 16:01.498
I miss seeing her.

16:01.523 --> 16:03.302
Oh, she was hot.

16:03.327 --> 16:04.490
Her body was recovered

16:04.515 --> 16:06.073
in the Arroyo on May 11.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.838
She'd been dead for days by then.

16:09.665 --> 16:11.633
She was talking to a guy that night.

16:11.666 --> 16:12.961
I got a little jealous.

16:12.991 --> 16:14.678
That's why I got the
drunk and disorderly.

16:14.703 --> 16:15.438
I fought him.

16:15.463 --> 16:16.930
Can you describe this guy to us?

16:17.023 --> 16:18.765
He's one shady mother.

16:18.790 --> 16:20.266
Untrustworthy eyes.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.351
Bad in his bones, you know?

16:22.376 --> 16:26.022
I think that's Hankspeak
for "he wasn't white."

16:27.424 --> 16:29.943
Can you provide any more
detail to us on him?

16:31.959 --> 16:33.476
Okay, so,

16:33.501 --> 16:35.199
romantic picnic checklist:

16:35.452 --> 16:37.397
wine... very important...

16:37.422 --> 16:38.413
Check.

16:38.438 --> 16:40.327
Cheese...

16:41.727 --> 16:43.794
that expired a month ago.

16:43.819 --> 16:44.988
This house absolutely falls apart

16:45.013 --> 16:46.788
when my wife is frozen in stasis.

16:46.813 --> 16:48.947
Okay, so no cheese.

16:50.211 --> 16:51.589
Extra wine.

16:51.614 --> 16:52.834
I like the way you think.

17:08.808 --> 17:10.391
What are you doing?

17:10.415 --> 17:12.484
Mayhem, mischief,

17:12.510 --> 17:14.029
delinquent behavior.

17:14.548 --> 17:16.696
What can I say, I'm on a crime spree.

17:16.722 --> 17:18.387
- Can I try?
- You?

17:18.413 --> 17:19.746
Isobel Evans?

17:19.771 --> 17:21.912
You've never even spoken to me before.

17:23.665 --> 17:26.124
I'm sick of being Isobel Evans.

17:28.175 --> 17:29.919
Yeah, I know the feeling.

17:29.944 --> 17:31.487
- Yeah?
- Are you kidding?

17:31.511 --> 17:32.881
It's, like, a Roswell rite of passage.

17:32.906 --> 17:35.224
One day, everybody in this
town just gets together

17:35.249 --> 17:36.914
and they, like, decide who you are,

17:36.939 --> 17:38.064
and that's who you get to be.

17:38.089 --> 17:39.247
Forever. End of story.

17:39.272 --> 17:41.444
Doesn't matter if you change

17:41.469 --> 17:43.094
or improve or figure out

17:43.119 --> 17:45.560
that you're not even who you
thought you were to begin with.

17:46.180 --> 17:48.146
You don't seem like you
care what they think.

17:48.171 --> 17:49.689
I don't.

17:49.953 --> 17:52.898
Aren't you afraid that
somebody's gonna see us talking?

17:56.526 --> 17:59.449
Maybe I'm not who everyone decided I am.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.139
Okay.

18:03.461 --> 18:04.594
Fine.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.650
What is that?

18:17.425 --> 18:18.729
It's nothing.

18:27.697 --> 18:29.229
Ready to go?

18:30.781 --> 18:32.941
All this time, I never remembered her.

18:32.966 --> 18:35.109
I-I didn't even think I knew her.

18:36.376 --> 18:37.904
But I remember now.

18:40.861 --> 18:42.563
I was friends

18:42.588 --> 18:44.974
with Rosa Ortecho.

18:52.412 --> 18:55.938
End abuse now! End abuse now!

18:55.963 --> 18:58.993
End abuse now! End abuse now!

19:00.552 --> 19:03.198
Guess it really wasn't
picnic weather anyway.

19:03.223 --> 19:04.828
End abuse now! End abuse now!

19:04.853 --> 19:06.232
Listen, Noah,

19:07.009 --> 19:09.318
I want to be with you, completely.

19:09.343 --> 19:11.194
That's why I told you the truth today.

19:11.393 --> 19:14.608
But I can't be complete
without my memories.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.735
Hence, why I turn to Liz Ortecho.

19:17.834 --> 19:19.550
Stolen stem cells...

19:19.575 --> 19:22.846
Do you think that you could...
hold my hand through this?

19:22.871 --> 19:24.034
Stolen stem cells...

19:24.253 --> 19:25.553
Mm-hmm.

19:25.578 --> 19:26.699
Will send you to Hell!

19:26.724 --> 19:28.329
End abuse now!

19:28.354 --> 19:31.291
End abuse now! End abuse now!

19:31.316 --> 19:32.928
Imagine spending your entire life

19:32.953 --> 19:34.627
standing in the way of progress.

19:34.652 --> 19:35.551
I'm with you.

19:35.576 --> 19:37.847
But at what point does
scientific progress

19:37.872 --> 19:41.091
just become about man playing God, hmm?

19:41.116 --> 19:43.219
Maybe there's just some stuff
we aren't meant to know.

19:43.244 --> 19:45.013
End abuse now!

19:51.421 --> 19:52.888
Look,

19:53.870 --> 19:56.483
the dissent sea parted.

19:57.024 --> 19:59.240
This will never get less weird.

20:01.584 --> 20:05.409
End abuse now! End abuse now!

20:05.434 --> 20:06.993
Two of hearts.

20:07.018 --> 20:08.610
Ace of spades.

20:08.635 --> 20:10.414
Queen of hearts.

20:11.818 --> 20:14.077
Oh. Oh.

20:14.102 --> 20:15.591
You're trying to play dirty.

20:15.616 --> 20:17.403
You're thinking three of diamonds,

20:17.428 --> 20:19.297
but the card that you're
holding is a joker.

20:21.992 --> 20:23.468
Thanks for comin'.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.619
Very impressive.

20:26.552 --> 20:28.179
You preparing for your Vegas act?

20:28.205 --> 20:30.016
Oh, no. You should be thanking them.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.610
They just paid for your booze.

20:31.635 --> 20:32.857
Here you go.

20:32.882 --> 20:35.063
To what do I owe the honor
of your day drinking, hmm?

20:35.199 --> 20:36.585
Please tell me it's just a standard,

20:36.610 --> 20:37.894
run-of-the-mill boy problem.

20:37.919 --> 20:40.134
I can't handle anything
more thrilling than that.

20:40.432 --> 20:43.672
Max was in here earlier
investigating a literal murder.

20:43.697 --> 20:45.032
Ah. Right.

20:45.572 --> 20:47.055
You don't look surprised.

20:47.656 --> 20:49.284
Yeah, it's a long story.

20:49.309 --> 20:50.720
But you are in luck.

20:50.745 --> 20:52.433
It is just a standard,

20:52.458 --> 20:54.092
run-of-the-mill boy problem.

20:57.026 --> 20:58.535
Oh, come on.

20:58.545 --> 21:00.922
Don't give me psychic face, Maria.

21:02.856 --> 21:04.551
It's the guy from the museum,

21:04.576 --> 21:06.162
the one that kissed you into crazy

21:06.187 --> 21:07.696
stupid love when we were kids.

21:07.721 --> 21:08.836
He's back?

21:09.044 --> 21:11.763
Wha... How-how do you do that?

21:11.788 --> 21:13.204
You're just...

21:13.411 --> 21:15.227
I feel it, you're-you're hopeful,

21:15.252 --> 21:16.729
like you were before.

21:17.329 --> 21:19.357
Who is he? Come on, spill it.

21:19.382 --> 21:20.759
I've been waiting ten years for this.

21:20.784 --> 21:23.918
- Come on.
- You... you wouldn't believe it.

21:23.943 --> 21:25.833
It's not like you're
hooking up with Wyatt Long

21:25.858 --> 21:27.747
or Michael Guerin or something.

21:27.772 --> 21:29.327
Geez.

21:31.734 --> 21:34.164
Please tell me you're in
love with Wyatt Long.

21:42.201 --> 21:43.773
Wow.

21:46.216 --> 21:48.469
Michael's not so bad after a shower.

21:49.998 --> 21:51.640
But you know that.

21:52.595 --> 21:53.615
I had no idea...

21:53.640 --> 21:54.601
I know.

21:55.282 --> 21:56.282
I mean,

21:56.307 --> 21:57.771
how would you?

21:57.796 --> 21:59.287
It meant nothing, Alex.

21:59.312 --> 22:02.030
Seriously, I swear, it
was just a drunk, dusty,

22:02.055 --> 22:04.276
no-good Texas rounder.

22:05.644 --> 22:07.197
Okay.

22:12.242 --> 22:13.912
I don't know, it was like...

22:14.996 --> 22:16.580
we were friends.

22:16.605 --> 22:18.548
You know? Like, I could feel it.

22:18.573 --> 22:20.706
- It was the beginning of a deep bond.
- Must be a side effect

22:20.731 --> 22:22.055
of my antidote.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.444
Your damaged cells are regenerating.

22:23.469 --> 22:25.229
That includes brain cells, so...

22:25.381 --> 22:27.452
parts of your brain that have gone dark

22:27.477 --> 22:29.090
are lighting up again.

22:29.455 --> 22:30.783
You remember meeting her.

22:30.808 --> 22:32.775
- What else do you remember?
- Nothing. That's it.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.445
It's disjointed. I-I need more antidote.

22:34.470 --> 22:36.726
- What? No. Absolutely not.
- Liz,

22:36.751 --> 22:38.290
I need to know. I...

22:38.487 --> 22:39.783
I need to know why I killed her.

22:39.808 --> 22:41.283
You don't think I want to know that?

22:41.308 --> 22:42.860
I cannot administer another dose.

22:42.884 --> 22:44.968
Your powers could come
back stronger than ever,

22:44.993 --> 22:47.445
- and you could still be dangerous.
- Okay, look, lady,

22:47.556 --> 22:49.268
I'm currently being very courteous.

22:49.293 --> 22:51.571
I could jump into your
mind and make you do it,

22:51.596 --> 22:56.079
but... I'd like for us to be
on the same team here, okay?

22:56.348 --> 22:57.956
I know how much Max cares about you.

22:57.981 --> 22:59.165
And I know how much you care

22:59.190 --> 23:00.413
about getting information about Rosa.

23:00.438 --> 23:03.137
So... work with me here.

23:09.926 --> 23:11.755
What are the side effects again?

23:11.788 --> 23:13.220
She gets extra alien-y?

23:13.245 --> 23:16.850
I am... only going to
administer a microdose.

23:17.043 --> 23:18.968
Should be enough to
kick-start the brain.

23:18.993 --> 23:20.960
If it's not, I cannot help you.

23:22.589 --> 23:24.731
Please evacuate this building.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.914
Does "mandatory evacuation"
mean something different

23:27.939 --> 23:28.736
in hospitals?

23:28.761 --> 23:30.538
It's an active shooter drill.
We have them all the time.

23:30.563 --> 23:31.906
Some, uh, wings of the
hospital lock down,

23:31.931 --> 23:33.450
others evacuate.

23:33.475 --> 23:35.815
Please evacuate...

23:35.840 --> 23:37.098
Babe, we got to go.

23:37.123 --> 23:38.905
- This isn't a drill.
- Liz, come on.

23:38.930 --> 23:40.120
They can't be exposed
to light this long.

23:40.145 --> 23:41.446
Liz, come on!

23:41.471 --> 23:43.280
Oh, my God!

23:44.986 --> 23:46.634
Oh, my God!

23:46.659 --> 23:49.064
- I got hit.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

23:59.178 --> 24:00.695
I was this close to embarking

24:00.720 --> 24:02.729
on a real bender at the Wild Pony.

24:03.227 --> 24:04.522
What's going on?

24:04.547 --> 24:06.649
Before my dad died, he
wrote me these letters.

24:06.674 --> 24:09.245
My mom hid them from me, but
Master Sergeant Manes wanted them.

24:09.270 --> 24:10.563
Badly.

24:10.588 --> 24:13.031
So I stole them and gave him copies.

24:13.125 --> 24:15.366
Today my mom gave me the originals.

24:15.612 --> 24:18.961
Didn't share the part about breaking
and entering to the sheriff.

24:23.770 --> 24:25.250
What the hell is that?

24:25.275 --> 24:26.750
Oh, you know. Just a fragment

24:26.775 --> 24:28.757
of a 70-year-old UFO.

24:28.782 --> 24:30.532
Your dad left it for me in the cabin.

24:30.999 --> 24:32.770
Some of the symbols in these letters

24:32.795 --> 24:34.761
match the symbols on this glass.

24:35.238 --> 24:38.431
I wonder if it correlates to a
specific mathematical cipher.

24:38.456 --> 24:40.673
I'll start with the Fibonacci sequence,

24:40.698 --> 24:42.039
and then maybe Shor's algorithm.

24:42.064 --> 24:45.390
My dad wasn't some type
of genius cryptographer.

24:45.415 --> 24:47.332
He was a small-town man.

24:50.654 --> 24:52.570
You're right. Um...

24:53.908 --> 24:57.818
Well, maybe he used these alien symbols

24:57.843 --> 24:59.861
to send you a coded message.

25:02.241 --> 25:05.993
The, uh, symbols representing
the English alphabet.

25:06.018 --> 25:07.877
It's possible.

25:12.585 --> 25:15.927
All right, I need a key word
or a phrase to crack this.

25:15.952 --> 25:18.024
It'd probably be something
only you two would know,

25:18.049 --> 25:19.716
something personal.

25:21.056 --> 25:22.740
Try "Magoo."

25:24.729 --> 25:27.659
_

25:43.935 --> 25:47.490
_

25:49.595 --> 25:51.254
It was my nickname.

25:51.279 --> 25:53.840
I wish I knew that in high school.

26:01.876 --> 26:03.807
I don't know, he was sick, man.

26:03.832 --> 26:05.852
I mean, we're lucky that
any of this makes sense.

26:09.074 --> 26:11.356
Maybe he just wanted to
tell you he loves you.

26:12.298 --> 26:13.735
In code?

26:15.602 --> 26:17.947
Get all those people out.

26:18.208 --> 26:20.729
The elevator has to be empty.
No. You need to clear

26:20.754 --> 26:22.412
- that back stairway.
- Okay, watch your step.

26:22.437 --> 26:23.450
Right this way, ma'am.

26:23.475 --> 26:24.983
Keep it moving.

26:25.008 --> 26:26.813
Evans, Cameron, we're
gonna need you to go...

26:26.838 --> 26:27.861
Okay, is the suspect still at large?

26:27.886 --> 26:28.782
Are there victims?

26:28.807 --> 26:30.508
We're following protocol,
waiting on word

26:30.533 --> 26:33.295
- from the county SWAT team.
- Evans!

26:33.822 --> 26:35.772
Everything is gonna be okay.

26:35.797 --> 26:37.100
Just stay quiet.

26:37.411 --> 26:39.292
- If he comes back...
- Oh, God.

26:39.317 --> 26:41.501
- He needs a real doctor.
- I've got this.

26:41.526 --> 26:42.615
It just grazed him, okay?

26:42.640 --> 26:44.515
But there is still an active
shooter out there, so...

26:44.540 --> 26:45.933
just stay quiet, please.

26:53.772 --> 26:56.934
Please evacuate this building.

26:57.738 --> 27:00.831
Please evacuate this building.

27:02.267 --> 27:04.351
Wait a second.

27:04.393 --> 27:05.902
- Isobel, no.
- Oh, my God!

27:05.927 --> 27:07.011
- Isobel, hey, hey.
- Wait.

27:07.036 --> 27:08.080
Max.

27:08.105 --> 27:09.238
It's Max.

27:09.263 --> 27:10.611
Is anyone hurt?

27:10.636 --> 27:12.033
I was freakin' shot, man.

27:12.058 --> 27:12.819
Isobel, okay.

27:12.844 --> 27:14.503
Okay, we'll get you out
of here, all right?

27:14.528 --> 27:15.819
Okay.

27:15.858 --> 27:17.498
- Stay behind me.
- Okay.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.103
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

27:22.369 --> 27:23.652
Okay, come on.

27:23.677 --> 27:25.509
Paramedics are over there.
They'll take a look at Noah.

27:25.534 --> 27:27.113
Text Mom and Dad, let
them know we're okay.

27:27.138 --> 27:29.251
All right? You stay with them, please.

27:29.276 --> 27:30.103
- No. Max!
- I'll be back.

27:30.128 --> 27:31.714
- Max!
- Max!

27:31.856 --> 27:33.631
Okay, come on, let's go.

27:36.426 --> 27:38.736
Please evacuate this building.

28:07.428 --> 28:09.278
This way. Okay?

28:09.303 --> 28:10.934
Uh-huh.

28:12.951 --> 28:15.712
Right this way, to the stairwell.

28:40.367 --> 28:42.211
- Have it?
- Thank you.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.992
It's fine, okay? It's gonna be fine.
Everything's fine.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.679
Hey, I know you're
freaking out about Max.

28:46.704 --> 28:48.622
- I'm freaking out about Max, too.
- Baby,

28:48.647 --> 28:50.349
I am freaking out about you.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.065
Did she get any more of
the antidote you need

28:54.090 --> 28:55.562
before the gunshots?

28:55.587 --> 28:57.045
Do you have any more memories?

28:57.070 --> 28:59.750
No. I don't think I got
a big enough dose,

28:59.775 --> 29:02.131
or maybe it doesn't work like that.

29:02.163 --> 29:03.688
Or maybe she just jabbed
my arm with a needle

29:03.713 --> 29:05.697
to arbitrarily inflict pain.

29:06.076 --> 29:08.152
- Not that I don't deserve it.
- Ma'am? Ma'am?

29:08.177 --> 29:10.179
- ¿Habla inglés?
- Sí, hablo inglés, muchacho.

29:10.204 --> 29:11.870
I don't need to be triaged.

29:11.895 --> 29:13.102
She seems like a lot.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.790
It's not my blood.

29:18.738 --> 29:19.921
Is he still in there?

29:19.946 --> 29:21.964
Evans isn't responding
to his radio, commands

29:21.989 --> 29:23.800
or his sense of logic.

29:23.947 --> 29:25.801
He always has to be the hero.

29:25.826 --> 29:27.303
Not really.

29:27.482 --> 29:29.210
This is actually kind of new.

29:33.017 --> 29:34.560
Is that smoke?

29:34.585 --> 29:36.103
That's the research wing.

29:38.713 --> 29:40.983
Hey, please, don't make me handcuff you.

29:59.986 --> 30:01.838
- Bad day?
- Just doesn't matter

30:01.863 --> 30:03.233
what I do. You know what I mean?

30:03.258 --> 30:04.697
Like, it doesn't matter
how good I try to be.

30:04.722 --> 30:07.247
Everybody in this town is just always
going to remember me for the bad,

30:07.272 --> 30:09.030
no matter what. They're
always going to think of me

30:09.055 --> 30:11.263
as the bad Ortecho, if
I even am an Ortecho.

30:11.288 --> 30:12.704
My mom, she's a liar,

30:12.729 --> 30:13.943
and she's gonna turn
me into a liar, too.

30:13.968 --> 30:15.184
Shh.

30:20.253 --> 30:22.400
Oh, crap.

30:24.378 --> 30:26.919
Sorry. Are you not a... hugger?

30:26.944 --> 30:28.352
I just...

30:29.126 --> 30:30.950
kind of felt like you needed a...

30:31.969 --> 30:33.995
No, I did. I just...

30:35.120 --> 30:36.766
I didn't realize it.

30:41.581 --> 30:44.311
You said that you didn't
care about my reputation.

30:44.336 --> 30:46.024
- I'm not ashamed of you.
- So then why act

30:46.049 --> 30:46.966
like you don't know me?

30:46.991 --> 30:49.552
I know I've been... acting weird lately.

30:49.577 --> 30:50.845
I wish I could be

30:50.870 --> 30:52.388
who I am with you all the time.

30:53.468 --> 30:54.947
Rosa?

30:55.155 --> 30:56.683
Who did this?

30:57.591 --> 30:59.269
It was Kate and Jasmine.

30:59.294 --> 31:01.022
They're pissed that I stopped partying.

31:01.047 --> 31:02.994
I thought Kate Long was my friend.

31:04.184 --> 31:06.205
And my mom sucks and Liz is gonna leave,

31:06.230 --> 31:07.694
and I can't handle it, okay?

31:16.394 --> 31:17.666
Isobel?

31:17.691 --> 31:18.630
You okay?

31:18.655 --> 31:20.104
Huh? Oh.

31:20.215 --> 31:22.483
Yeah. I'll be fine as
soon as Max is safe.

31:22.508 --> 31:24.587
- Isobel! Iz.
- Michael!

31:27.239 --> 31:28.549
Oh.

31:29.092 --> 31:30.755
You guys okay?

31:30.780 --> 31:32.197
Where's Max?

31:46.173 --> 31:47.639
Sheriff's department.

31:47.664 --> 31:49.330
I'm armed.

32:06.881 --> 32:09.528
- Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
- I didn't want to do this.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.539
Put that down. Slowly.

32:11.564 --> 32:13.819
I don't remember. I was outside

32:13.844 --> 32:15.561
with my "Invasion of the
Baby Snatchers" poster,

32:15.594 --> 32:17.303
and then, I was down here,

32:17.328 --> 32:19.891
and it smells like smoke... I
don't know... and with this!

32:19.916 --> 32:21.812
Put the gun down!

32:28.074 --> 32:29.382
Are you telling me

32:29.407 --> 32:31.802
you blacked out shooting up a hospital?

32:32.125 --> 32:34.281
I would never, ever do this.

32:34.306 --> 32:35.532
I don't even like guns.

32:35.557 --> 32:37.910
I can't own a...

32:54.823 --> 32:57.607
Hey. The sheriff is transporting
our perp to county.

32:57.632 --> 32:59.639
The perp is my barista.

32:59.664 --> 33:01.510
He works at Bean Me Up.

33:01.535 --> 33:03.127
He draws little UFOs on the foam.

33:03.152 --> 33:04.570
He wouldn't do this.

33:04.595 --> 33:06.146
He says he remembers nothing.

33:06.519 --> 33:08.816
It's starting to become
a familiar refrain.

33:09.453 --> 33:12.194
You shouldn't have gone in
there without backup, Evans.

33:12.219 --> 33:13.571
I caught the guy, didn't I?

33:14.978 --> 33:17.575
Liz was really scared.

33:17.878 --> 33:20.660
I don't think she took a breath
till Valenti said you were safe.

33:21.101 --> 33:22.672
Do you know where I can find her?

33:22.697 --> 33:25.583
Well, they just started letting
people back into the east wing.

33:25.974 --> 33:28.002
All right. Thank you.

33:34.609 --> 33:36.585
So I've been having
these flashes of Rosa.

33:36.610 --> 33:38.162
I don't know.

33:38.187 --> 33:39.670
I think I was, like, in love with her.

33:39.695 --> 33:41.166
In this memory, like, I could feel it.

33:41.191 --> 33:43.190
Like I wanted her.

33:43.452 --> 33:45.710
And I wanted to hurt
anyone that hurt her.

33:45.874 --> 33:47.396
Okay.

33:47.907 --> 33:50.608
Okay? That's... You don't
have anything else to say?

33:50.660 --> 33:53.486
Um... welcome to the party?

33:53.763 --> 33:56.447
It's a real bisexual
alien blast around here.

33:58.823 --> 34:00.386
I need to know more.

34:00.411 --> 34:03.287
So please tell me I know you
as well as I think I do.

34:10.009 --> 34:11.309
I swiped it yesterday.

34:11.333 --> 34:14.784
You little street rat!

34:14.810 --> 34:16.360
Hey, look, Liz...

34:16.385 --> 34:18.851
isn't so bad, but I don't trust anyone.

34:18.877 --> 34:20.373
If she's got an alien poison,
I'm gonna squirrel away

34:20.398 --> 34:22.389
- the antidote.
- I knew you'd steal some.

34:22.414 --> 34:24.273
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:24.297 --> 34:26.518
This is all we have left,

34:26.543 --> 34:28.395
and you drank more than enough.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.608
Oh, okay.

34:32.632 --> 34:34.693
So what shall we do while we wait?

34:34.717 --> 34:36.737
I'm gonna go home and be with Noah.

34:36.797 --> 34:38.306
Ooh, let me get this straight.

34:38.331 --> 34:39.639
You want to go home

34:39.664 --> 34:41.032
to your human husband

34:41.056 --> 34:43.864
while an experimental
alien-death-serum antidote

34:43.889 --> 34:45.663
triggers repressed murder
memories in your brain?

34:45.688 --> 34:47.462
He loves me.

34:47.722 --> 34:49.750
I really missed you.

34:49.775 --> 34:51.762
I'd say I missed you, too, but

34:51.786 --> 34:53.771
time didn't really pass for me,
so it's more like I blinked,

34:53.795 --> 34:58.008
and suddenly, it's cold,
and, like, your hair is

34:58.033 --> 35:00.136
significantly worse.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.178
Right.

35:07.275 --> 35:08.924
Well, I'm glad you're safe.

35:08.949 --> 35:11.188
I'm just so relieved you
weren't at work today.

35:11.213 --> 35:13.566
A friend and I were trying
to decipher Dad's letters.

35:13.591 --> 35:16.400
- Learn anything new?
- Does the name "Caulfield"

35:16.694 --> 35:17.819
mean anything to you?

35:17.844 --> 35:19.870
- Ah.
- It's repeated in Dad's letters.

35:19.911 --> 35:20.775
Someone he knew?

35:20.800 --> 35:22.991
N-No, it's not a person. It's a place.

35:23.078 --> 35:25.286
It's a prison a hundred
miles north of here.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.913
Your grandfather started his
career as a C.O. there,

35:27.938 --> 35:30.583
but it's-it's been
shut down for decades.

35:32.401 --> 35:34.712
You know how confused
your dad was at the end.

35:35.847 --> 35:37.381
Right.

35:38.197 --> 35:39.966
Yeah, of course.

35:42.578 --> 35:44.752
We're closed.

35:48.152 --> 35:49.768
You found my necklace.

35:50.377 --> 35:51.854
Clasp broke.

35:52.281 --> 35:53.529
I fixed it.

35:53.554 --> 35:55.399
I think it calls for a celebration.

35:55.424 --> 35:57.859
And by celebration, I mean booze,

35:57.884 --> 35:59.944
preferably the free kind.

36:01.002 --> 36:03.407
Alex is one of my best friends.

36:04.315 --> 36:05.742
Congrats.

36:05.775 --> 36:06.838
I never would have slept with you

36:06.863 --> 36:08.621
if I knew you two had history.

36:09.857 --> 36:11.539
It can't happen again.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.211
You keep saying that.

36:16.307 --> 36:18.129
I got it.

36:22.849 --> 36:24.636
Come back when we're open.

36:26.673 --> 36:28.807
Right.

37:04.758 --> 37:06.423
Oh, Valenti said you caught the shooter.

37:06.448 --> 37:07.626
I-I was looking for you. I...

37:07.651 --> 37:09.740
I didn't want to interfere.

37:10.068 --> 37:12.184
She said you were okay, but...

37:12.378 --> 37:14.770
- are you okay?
- Are you?

37:16.042 --> 37:18.148
Then I'm okay.

37:24.875 --> 37:27.418
Liz, this was the only part
of the hospital that burned.

37:27.443 --> 37:29.493
I think this was a targeted attack.

37:30.447 --> 37:32.412
I figured.

37:33.706 --> 37:36.833
The damage is gonna set us back months,

37:36.858 --> 37:39.034
and we'll have to start over,
if the board even lets us.

37:39.176 --> 37:40.833
The wrong side won today.

37:40.858 --> 37:42.464
Our suspect is Connor Smith.

37:42.489 --> 37:45.396
He's a pacifist who likes latte art.
He says he doesn't

37:45.421 --> 37:47.219
remember doing any of this,
that he blacked it out.

37:47.244 --> 37:49.735
When I found him, he
didn't seem violent.

37:49.760 --> 37:53.031
He was cowering, and
then, he had a seizure,

37:53.056 --> 37:54.101
so I hauled him out.

37:54.126 --> 37:56.478
Wait. Connor. He used to work

37:56.503 --> 37:58.912
at the Crashdown before he
abandoned us for Bean Me Up.

37:58.937 --> 38:01.937
- He's epileptic.
- That would explain the seizure.

38:03.807 --> 38:05.738
Max, what...?

38:06.073 --> 38:09.907
No. What-what if this
isn't about my study?

38:09.932 --> 38:11.028
What if this is about

38:11.053 --> 38:12.745
the other things I've
been working on in here?

38:12.770 --> 38:15.029
The antidote and the serum...
They're all gone.

38:15.054 --> 38:16.996
Today was like Wyatt Long

38:17.021 --> 38:19.543
at Grant Green's warehouse
all over again.

38:19.568 --> 38:20.921
Wyatt said that he blacked out

38:20.946 --> 38:23.339
after a bender at the Wild
Pony when he torched me.

38:23.364 --> 38:26.550
Connor has epileptic blackouts.
I mean...

38:27.259 --> 38:29.460
What if the fourth alien can...?

38:29.494 --> 38:31.263
Get in people's mind
when they're blacked out

38:31.288 --> 38:33.098
and convince them to commit murder?

38:33.123 --> 38:34.385
You said Isobel's blackouts started

38:34.410 --> 38:35.982
after trauma when you were a kid.

38:36.007 --> 38:37.872
- Yeah.
- So all three murderers

38:37.897 --> 38:40.480
have preexisting conditions
that cause blackouts.

38:40.778 --> 38:43.358
But what if we're not looking
for three murderers?

38:43.630 --> 38:47.695
What if we're just looking for
one murderous mind-influencer?

38:48.189 --> 38:51.007
Wait. You're suggesting that
Isobel didn't kill Rosa at all,

38:51.032 --> 38:52.406
that someone made her do it.

38:52.431 --> 38:53.897
Yes, Max.

38:53.922 --> 38:57.747
I think maybe your sister
is innocent of all of this.

39:06.115 --> 39:07.757
Mm.

39:16.968 --> 39:19.770
I don't want to hurt you, but
you need to leave me alone...

39:23.597 --> 39:25.901
Oh, my God.

39:28.077 --> 39:29.594
Oh.

39:29.619 --> 39:31.448
My God. What the hell?

39:31.473 --> 39:33.022
Where is it?!

39:36.548 --> 39:39.009
Did you steal my backpack?
Izzie, I need that ticket.

39:39.034 --> 39:41.750
Okay? I know that you don't
want me to go, but I have to.

39:41.775 --> 39:43.544
You don't have to go anywhere.

39:44.647 --> 39:46.405
I took care of it.

39:46.951 --> 39:48.801
Come with me.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.718
Let me show you how I'll
never let anything hurt you.

39:51.743 --> 39:54.346
Look, I'm sorry that I
don't like you like that.

39:54.371 --> 39:55.629
Okay, I don't want to hurt you,

39:55.654 --> 39:57.641
but you really have to leave me alone.

39:57.666 --> 40:00.476
This isn't me, Rosa.

40:00.501 --> 40:02.427
This isn't my body.

40:02.452 --> 40:04.609
I can be anything you want me to be.

40:04.634 --> 40:06.567
Oh, God. You're higher than I am.

40:06.592 --> 40:08.902
I'm not Isobel.

40:10.096 --> 40:12.572
You want someone strong.

40:14.277 --> 40:16.119
Someone who will protect you,

40:16.144 --> 40:18.537
who won't leave you.

40:20.286 --> 40:22.458
I can be that man.

40:25.937 --> 40:28.004
I killed those girls for you.

40:30.181 --> 40:31.966
You...

40:32.468 --> 40:34.095
Kate and Jasmine.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.212
No.

40:35.237 --> 40:37.181
I snapped their little necks.

40:37.206 --> 40:38.723
They're outside.

40:38.748 --> 40:40.559
Come and see.

40:41.322 --> 40:42.936
Come.

40:44.251 --> 40:46.022
See.

40:48.474 --> 40:49.901
Okay.

40:51.745 --> 40:53.221
Show me.

40:59.652 --> 41:01.454
You're lying to me.

41:10.595 --> 41:12.683
I can feel what you feel.

41:13.285 --> 41:16.637
You hate me now, don't you? Aah.

41:17.321 --> 41:19.515
You don't want to be mine?

41:20.171 --> 41:22.143
Isobel?!

41:22.168 --> 41:24.252
But I did it for you.

41:26.544 --> 41:28.899
Everything was for you.

41:31.051 --> 41:33.194
What did you do?

41:38.212 --> 41:40.034
She couldn't be trusted.

41:40.059 --> 41:41.541
Isobel?

41:41.566 --> 41:43.372
No!
