This is the Evergreen

00:02.202 --> 00:03.970
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.970 --> 00:06.139
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.276
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.145
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.313 --> 00:15.382
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.416 --> 00:17.417
Yikes!

00:18.084 --> 00:19.386
Yaaaah...

00:22.188 --> 00:23.523
Yeaaaah!

00:23.523 --> 00:26.626
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.436
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.837 --> 00:39.272
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.809 --> 00:45.145
And his life would be simple
except for...

the Raccoons!!

01:02.028 --> 01:03.997
School's over
for another week,

01:03.997 --> 01:06.966
and for most kids, it's a chance
to turn their attention

01:06.966 --> 01:08.468
to the world around them.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.403
But as Bentley
Raccoon heads home,

01:10.403 --> 01:13.706
his attention is a
million miles away.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.575
If a man
gets into a car,

01:15.575 --> 01:19.245
and travels at 45 kilometers
an hour for 18 hours...

01:19.245 --> 01:21.681
- Faster!
- Yahooo!

01:23.283 --> 01:26.252
...then accelerates
to 60 kilometers an hour

01:26.252 --> 01:27.287

01:27.287 --> 01:29.322
Uaaah!

Where is he?

01:30.690 --> 01:32.992
Gee, I hope he's
near a washroom!

01:34.160 --> 01:36.896
- You think this
is funny, do you?
- Yeah, do you?

01:36.896 --> 01:39.499
Excuse me?
- Why don't you watch
where you're going!

01:39.499 --> 01:42.135
Yeah, watch where
you're going!!
Hey, give me that back!

01:42.135 --> 01:44.637
Give it here. Come on, guys!

01:44.637 --> 01:48.975
Okay. Have your stupid book.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.044
Yah! (bam!) Uh!

01:51.044 --> 01:52.645
What a goof!

01:52.645 --> 01:55.715
When you learn to stop
knocking people off the path,

01:55.715 --> 01:58.318
give us a call, pal!

01:58.318 --> 02:00.520
Hey, come back here!
That's my book!

02:05.191 --> 02:07.260
I'm gonna
get those guys for this.

02:12.832 --> 02:16.002
This is only the first
phase of my master plan.

02:16.002 --> 02:18.004
Once I've plastered
this picture

02:18.004 --> 02:20.006
on every billboard
in the forest,

02:20.006 --> 02:22.876
people will see
what Cyril Sneer drinks.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.579
They'll be clamoring
to buy my drink!

02:26.579 --> 02:29.682
Then I'll lower my
prices to rock bottom,

02:29.682 --> 02:32.018
and drive the competition
out of business!

02:33.553 --> 02:35.054
With the market to myself,

02:35.054 --> 02:37.924
there's only one
reasonable thing to do,

02:37.924 --> 02:40.660
raise the prices right
through the roof!

02:43.363 --> 02:45.532
Pigs, answer the phone!

02:45.532 --> 02:48.067
Where are those
lethargic loin chops?

02:48.067 --> 02:50.837
Booosss, oh, boooossss!

02:50.837 --> 02:52.872
Have we got something
to show you!!

02:53.806 --> 02:58.144
Pig 1: Ohh, sorry for the
intrusion, your Majesty.

02:58.144 --> 03:03.783
We seek a pink guy with
a nose about yaaay long...

03:03.783 --> 03:05.518
It's me, meathead!

03:05.518 --> 03:06.853
Now answer those phones!

03:06.853 --> 03:09.155
I've got tons of work
to do around here.

03:09.155 --> 03:11.024
Pig 2: Of course you do, boss,

03:11.024 --> 03:13.526
and that's why we've
come up with something,

03:13.526 --> 03:16.296
that will really
free up your time.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.598
If your office is in a mess...

03:18.598 --> 03:21.401
Pig 1: ...send right for an SOS!

03:21.401 --> 03:23.203
Pig 3: Swine Office Software!

Pig 1: It can run your business
without any glitches.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.776
Pig 2: The SOS software discs
have been custom designed

03:29.776 --> 03:31.811
for Sneer Enterprises.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.881
Pig 1: And we'll make
this computer think,

03:34.881 --> 03:38.551
act and behave just like you.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.987
Great!!
Then there will be two of us

There, all your
problems are solved!

03:48.995 --> 03:51.864
How do I know it's not
just playing elevator music

03:51.864 --> 03:53.399
in my customer's ears?

03:53.399 --> 03:54.367
Listen.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.769
Hey, how about
that money I owe you?

03:56.769 --> 03:58.738
Ha-ha, the check's in the mail!

03:58.738 --> 04:00.106
Cyril, Cyril, ha-ha,

04:00.106 --> 04:02.108
how about sending
those supplies over?

04:02.108 --> 04:03.977
What do you say, Cyril, baby?
Come on, man.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.479
Why, it's that
weasel Maximillion Leech?!

04:06.479 --> 04:08.081
I'll take care of this!

04:08.081 --> 04:09.449
Wait!

04:09.449 --> 04:11.818
Let SOS handle it.

Listen, Leech,
if I do not see

04:13.620 --> 04:15.922
some cold, hard cash, pronto,

04:15.922 --> 04:18.291
you will hear from
so many lawyers

04:18.291 --> 04:21.027
that Latin will become
your second language.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.162
Fantastic!

04:23.162 --> 04:27.467
Now I can concentrate on
becoming the soda pop king!

04:27.467 --> 04:29.802
You, boys, deserve a bonus!

04:29.802 --> 04:31.070
A bonus?!

04:31.070 --> 04:32.338
Here!

04:32.338 --> 04:33.740
It's on me!

04:34.474 --> 04:37.810
Gee, thanks,
Your Royal Highness.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.648
This'll do the trick.

just meditating.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.235
Where'd you learn that?

05:02.235 --> 05:04.370
Ohh, a long
time ago when I was a

05:04.370 --> 05:06.806
martial arts student
studying for my black belt.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.074
Black belt!!

teach me the martial arts?

Well, you see,
I gave it up years ago.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.029
I'd be pretty rusty, and uh,

05:30.029 --> 05:32.365
I've gotta get going, Bentley.

Well, you've
got some talent, Bentley.

martial arts than just

07:16.869 --> 07:18.471
kicking and flipping people.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.873
Then teach me!
You've got your black belt.

but I'm just too busy

07:34.020 --> 07:38.024

I just can't teach you.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.827
Never mind, guys.
We can teach ourselves.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.262

mean he's still busy?

08:06.719 --> 08:10.022

I've been waiting over an hour!

place a couple of days ago.

waiting for nothing!

08:47.093 --> 08:49.028
Pig 3: Maybe he just
stepped out to, uh,

08:49.028 --> 08:50.930
freshen up before your meeting.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.932

buy his company,

was expecting you.

to Sneer Enterprises.

muscles into my market?

so far into the ground,

to climb out of the hole!

09:22.395 --> 09:23.996
I want this guy's name!
Pig 2: Oooh...

09:23.996 --> 09:28.834
is this turning into a
hostile takeover, or what?

09:30.136 --> 09:31.203
Uuuh-eh!

09:31.203 --> 09:32.905
Oh, this is
going to be great!

09:32.905 --> 09:35.775

belts in no time!

arts masters!

mind putting these on,

advanced class.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.984
Yeah, we're all
ready to learn how to fight!

10:18.551 --> 10:19.552
Fight!?

10:20.186 --> 10:21.354
Bentley,

10:22.989 --> 10:25.691
I'm not teaching you
boys how to fight.

10:25.691 --> 10:28.361
Martial arts teaches
self-defense,

10:28.361 --> 10:29.762
and there's a big difference.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.631
Do you understand?

10:32.665 --> 10:34.000
Yeah, sure.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.168
Good. Now,
if you fellas feel

10:36.168 --> 10:38.270
you're an advanced group,
we'll skip the breathing

10:38.270 --> 10:40.206

Bentley/Bert/Cedric:

12:02.121 --> 12:04.657
Hey, you
guys did rather well!

12:04.657 --> 12:08.327
Well, one thing's for sure,

12:08.327 --> 12:11.030
we're working on
our breathing now.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.832
I guess there's more
to learning martial arts

12:12.832 --> 12:16.335
than I thought. But there
is one thing I'd love to see.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.137
What's that?
Some karate!

12:18.137 --> 12:20.773
Do you think you could
bust this stick in half?

12:22.441 --> 12:24.443
No... look, fellas,

12:24.443 --> 12:27.113
I think now is a good
time to take a break.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.148
We'll meet back
here after lunch.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.950
Sure thing, Schaeffer.

12:31.951 --> 12:32.985
See you later.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.355
Gee, I hope I didn't
insult Schaeffer.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.125
Maybe breaking that stick was
too easy for a black belt.

12:45.131 --> 12:47.666
Some black belt I am.

12:48.968 --> 12:49.401
I've had it with

12:49.401 --> 12:50.703
I've had it
with that guy!

12:50.703 --> 12:54.340
He's taking all my
business, all my money!

12:54.340 --> 12:56.175
Do you boys have anything yet?

12:56.175 --> 12:58.511
Pig 1: We're
working on it, boss.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.547
Pig 2: But getting into the
Delicious Drinks computer

13:01.547 --> 13:03.649
isn't that easy.

13:03.649 --> 13:06.719
Pig 1: This guy is a genius
at hiding information.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.855
I want the name of this
Mr. Delicious Drinks.

13:09.855 --> 13:12.458
I want his company clobbered.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.794
I want my desk back.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.563
Pig 2: Hey, I'm into the system!

13:17.563 --> 13:18.731
Ha-haaa!

13:18.731 --> 13:20.900
Now, get me the
name of this clown.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.669
Pig 2: I can't access
all the files yet, but...

13:23.669 --> 13:26.405
This is no good!
There's no name!

13:26.405 --> 13:28.908
Wait! Here's
something I can use.

13:28.908 --> 13:32.144
Delicious Drinks doesn't own
the land their factory is on!

13:35.147 --> 13:37.249
Now, a big
key to self-defense,

13:37.249 --> 13:39.385
is to never let your
opponent hit you.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.720
Okay Bentley, let it go.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.523
It takes practice...
Wow!

13:44.523 --> 13:47.026
...patience,
and balance!

13:47.026 --> 13:48.027
Wow.

13:48.027 --> 13:49.461
Why don't you
give it a try, Bentley?

13:50.262 --> 13:51.564
This is easy!

13:51.564 --> 13:53.833
I thought,
you might say that.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.903
Hey, nice pajamas, kids!

13:57.903 --> 14:01.207
Oh yeah, nice jammies!

14:01.207 --> 14:02.208
Ugh!

14:02.208 --> 14:06.111
What a little baby!!

14:06.111 --> 14:08.781
Hiiiya!
I'll get those guys!

14:08.781 --> 14:11.684
Hoo-ho! They won't
mess with me, ever!!

14:11.684 --> 14:13.219
Aiiiya!

14:13.219 --> 14:15.721
Bentley, are
those two fellas the reason

14:15.721 --> 14:17.456
you want to learn all this?

14:17.456 --> 14:18.724
In a couple
of more classes

14:18.724 --> 14:21.293
and I'll be ready
for them, right?

14:21.293 --> 14:22.561
Wrong!

14:23.562 --> 14:25.865
I'm sorry, Bentley,
but there won't be

14:25.865 --> 14:27.633
any more classes for you.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.974
I need that order.
I have a banquet tomorrow.

14:35.908 --> 14:39.144
No. In fact, I haven't received
a drink order in over a week!

14:40.112 --> 14:43.115
Well, please try. Thanks!

14:43.115 --> 14:44.450
Schaeffer?
There's something

14:44.450 --> 14:46.085
I gotta talk to you about.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.586
Sure,
Bert, fire away.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.389
Well, it's about Bentley.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.926
I mean, you kicked him out
of the class yesterday and...

14:54.393 --> 14:57.963
Well, don't you think you were a
bit hard on the little guy?

14:57.963 --> 14:59.765
No, not really.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.469
Bentley was learning martial
arts for all the wrong reasons.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.271
He might just hurt someone.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.841
Like.. I did once.

15:08.841 --> 15:12.711
It was a long time ago, just
after I'd earned my black belt

15:12.711 --> 15:14.480
and I was playing with a friend.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.349
Well, we got into some
silly argument and...

15:17.349 --> 15:19.151
I hit him.

15:19.151 --> 15:20.786
I only meant to give him a tap,

15:20.786 --> 15:22.521
but I really hurt him.

15:23.689 --> 15:27.826
Well, I was never really able
to use my martial arts again.

15:27.826 --> 15:30.963
I couldn't even break
that stick the other day.

15:30.963 --> 15:31.964
Wow!

15:32.464 --> 15:35.768
But Bentley wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.436
I don't
know about that.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.738
Everyone gets mad sometimes.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.674
And if Bentley is going
to use martial arts

15:41.674 --> 15:43.809
to get even with his classmates?

15:44.710 --> 15:46.779
I just won't teach him.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.948
What if I went
and talked to Bentley, eh?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.649
If he settled things
with those guys,

15:50.649 --> 15:52.785
could he get back
into the class?

15:52.785 --> 15:53.886
That would help,

15:53.886 --> 15:56.055
but give him a little
time to cool down.

15:56.055 --> 15:59.725
Bentley is... still pretty angry.

16:00.392 --> 16:01.460
Bert?

16:02.528 --> 16:05.130
Pig 1: I think the boss is
taking this revenge thing

16:05.130 --> 16:07.666
just a bit too seriously.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.234
Pig 2: He's gone nuts!!

16:09.234 --> 16:10.769
Pig 1: He's at the
end of his rope.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.671
Hah-haa!
This is the big leagues

16:12.671 --> 16:14.306
and we play for keeps!

16:14.306 --> 16:17.543
And I just bought the land
his factory's sitting on.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.879
Take her down, boys!

16:22.748 --> 16:26.585
Good morning, Delicious Drinks!

16:26.585 --> 16:30.022
This is an eviction notice!

16:30.022 --> 16:32.658
You got 15 minutes to clear out.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.360
...15 minutes to clear out.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.896
Close up shop! Call it a day!

16:40.099 --> 16:44.703
Yaaaa! Ya! Ya!

16:44.703 --> 16:45.871
Aya!

16:45.871 --> 16:48.207
Uaaah!

16:48.841 --> 16:50.909
Ohh brother.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.782
Bentley?
They've come to get me.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.120
Bentley?!
I'll show them.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.388
Aya!
Uaaah!

17:02.388 --> 17:04.023
Ow! My arm!

17:04.023 --> 17:06.091
Oh my gosh,
I didn't know!

17:06.091 --> 17:07.292
Oh, oh, don't touch it!

17:07.292 --> 17:10.095
Ohh no, oh,
I think it's broken!

17:10.095 --> 17:13.065
Oh no! I really
broke your arm, Bert?

17:13.065 --> 17:14.633
Oooooh!

17:18.270 --> 17:21.073
Hello?

17:21.073 --> 17:24.309
Ohh my gosh,
what's happened here?

17:24.309 --> 17:28.113
(laughs) It's called
settling an old score.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.815
Ha! Now move it.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.758
Ugh!
Oh no!

17:40.125 --> 17:42.394
I'm stuck!
Get me out of here!

17:43.629 --> 17:46.999
It won't
budge! It's jammed in.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.767
Do you have any tools?

17:48.767 --> 17:50.335
Forget it!! Run!!

17:54.740 --> 17:57.242
Yah!
Neat trick!

18:03.182 --> 18:04.983
Thank you, Schaeffer!

18:04.983 --> 18:07.119
You saved my neck.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.821
If there's anything
I can ever do...

18:08.821 --> 18:11.356
Forget it.
I just came here

18:11.356 --> 18:13.459
to get this drink order filled.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.094
Consider it done.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.496
Pig 1: Boss!!
Pig 2: Hold on!

18:17.496 --> 18:18.964
Pig 3: Wait!!

18:18.964 --> 18:21.200
Pig 1: Don't...
Pig 2: Stop, please!

18:21.200 --> 18:23.969
You're too late.
You missed all the fun.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.037
What's that?

18:25.037 --> 18:26.472
Pig 3: Oh, well...

18:26.472 --> 18:29.975
It's just a computer
print out. Heh-he.

18:29.975 --> 18:33.445
We found out who owns,
eh, Delicious Drinks.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.948
Go on, make my day!

18:35.948 --> 18:38.617
Tell me it's someone,
I really don't like.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.520
Pig 2: Oh well, it's... uh,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.055
you!

18:43.055 --> 18:46.091
What? That's impossible.

18:46.091 --> 18:51.163
It does seems that our
computer program, SOS,

18:51.163 --> 18:54.867
well, it was doing a
great job of running

18:54.867 --> 18:56.401
your smaller companies...

18:56.401 --> 18:59.171
Pig 2: Yeah, like
Delicious Drinks,

18:59.171 --> 19:01.006
Pig 1: But.. ehm...

19:01.006 --> 19:03.976
When you tried
to buy the company,

19:03.976 --> 19:08.547
well, it only acted the
way you would.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.182
Kind of funny, huh?

19:10.182 --> 19:12.718
Funny?! I've
destroyed my own company.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.219
If you find that funny,

19:14.219 --> 19:16.855
then this should
really crack you up.

19:16.855 --> 19:19.091
Flying pigs!

19:19.091 --> 19:22.094
Aaaaaaah!

19:22.928 --> 19:25.898
Ah! Just sign
anywhere you can find a space!

19:25.898 --> 19:28.267
Wow! Look at
all the names on it!

19:28.267 --> 19:32.104
Yeah, it's a cast
of thousands.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.239
Has, uh, Bentley
signed it yet?

19:34.239 --> 19:37.876
No. When he saw
the cast, he just ran off.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.077
Aaah!

19:39.077 --> 19:40.879
How could I be so dumb?

19:41.747 --> 19:44.449
Hey, it's the pyjamas kid!

19:44.449 --> 19:46.084
He thinks, he's so tough.

19:46.084 --> 19:48.353
You still looking for this?

19:48.353 --> 19:51.290
Yeah, and I'd
like it back now, please?

19:51.290 --> 19:54.059
Sure. Here you go.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.394
Take it!

19:57.129 --> 19:58.430
Ow! Oh!

19:58.430 --> 20:03.101
So, you're still
knocking people over, huh?

20:03.101 --> 20:05.237
I just
want my book back.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.273
Well, I don't think you've
learned your lesson.

20:08.874 --> 20:09.875
Yet!!

20:09.875 --> 20:11.543
Chi-ay-haa!

20:12.711 --> 20:14.546
Grrrrh!

20:14.546 --> 20:16.448
Yyy-ah!

20:16.448 --> 20:18.884
Why don't you hold
still and fight?

20:18.884 --> 20:20.919
Because I don't
want to fight. That's why!

20:20.919 --> 20:22.854
You knocked us off our bike!

20:22.854 --> 20:24.156
That was an accident.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.724
Come on, let's get him!

20:25.724 --> 20:27.926
Ya!
- Wha! Whoa!

20:30.429 --> 20:33.632
You're a pretty fast
mover, aren't you kid?

20:33.632 --> 20:35.500
Fast enough to
get out of the way of a bike...

20:35.500 --> 20:37.102
if I'd seen it.

20:38.937 --> 20:39.938
Maybe.

20:41.106 --> 20:42.140
Maybe.

20:43.675 --> 20:46.211
Hey... could you show me

20:46.211 --> 20:48.313
ho-how you did that flip thing?

20:48.313 --> 20:51.083
Bentley and his
classmates met that day

20:51.083 --> 20:52.818
looking for revenge.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.754
But with a little courage
and confidence,

20:55.754 --> 20:58.523
what they found was friendship,

20:58.523 --> 21:00.659
The trick is
to concentrate.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.594
Ehm.. hi, guys!

21:02.594 --> 21:03.929
Hiya Bentley!

21:03.929 --> 21:07.299
Um, I just wanted to
return this and say that I'm...

21:07.299 --> 21:11.303
well, I'm... I'm sorry for
all the trouble I've caused.

21:11.303 --> 21:12.638
That's
all right, Bentley.

21:12.638 --> 21:17.175
I heard how you handled your
problem, and I'm proud of you,

21:17.175 --> 21:19.077
but you're going to
look kind of silly...

21:19.945 --> 21:22.514
wearing this without your robe.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.149
A yellow belt!!

21:24.149 --> 21:27.219
It's the first step to
getting your black belt.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.689
That's... if you want
to come back to the class.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.157
Wait a second!

21:32.157 --> 21:35.327
He's not getting back
into class that easily!!

21:35.327 --> 21:36.495
But Bert...

21:36.495 --> 21:40.365
I want his
signature on this cast!

21:40.365 --> 21:42.567
