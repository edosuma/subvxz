01:23.876 --> 01:25.294
Alice!

01:30.132 --> 01:31.592
She's not upstairs.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.348
Alice!

01:48.609 --> 01:51.153
Alice!
You're going to be late!

01:57.868 --> 01:59.495
Alice!

02:10.673 --> 02:11.924
Alice!

02:37.157 --> 02:38.868
Alice!

02:38.868 --> 02:40.578
What are you doing in here?

02:44.957 --> 02:47.334
No, Alice. No.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.324
When did you know?

03:18.324 --> 03:21.327
Well, you know I had a fling with Clem.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.621
Till I found out he was married.

03:23.621 --> 03:26.624
You and I happened straight after that.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.792
So you knew when we met?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.002
No.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.254
There was a crossover.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.465
So, after Gemma was born?

03:34.465 --> 03:35.716
No.

03:37.343 --> 03:41.805
It wasn't really until she got sick
and needed a transplant.

03:44.642 --> 03:47.061
When neither of us were a match,

03:47.061 --> 03:50.981
the doctor pulled me aside
and... raised the question.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.610
How did you contact him?

03:56.654 --> 03:58.989
I wrote him a letter

03:58.989 --> 04:01.575
and sent a lock of Gemma's hair.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.331
And the photo of her reading.

04:07.331 --> 04:08.916
Then what?

04:08.916 --> 04:12.878
I heard nothing.
I was so furious I went to his house.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.672
I begged him to get a test.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.173
And he wouldn't.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.764
I saw her that day -

04:23.764 --> 04:25.182
Alice.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.769
They were so alike.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.647
That's when you knew?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.402
Agnes, did she know?

04:36.402 --> 04:38.654
She overheard me that day.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.699
Later, she told me that she tried
to talk Clem round,

04:41.699 --> 04:43.784
and paid the price.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.667
And, Agnes,
did she give you the carving?

04:51.667 --> 04:52.876
No.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.045
Clem sent it after Gemma died.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.881
He spent all that time carving this,

04:57.881 --> 05:00.884
and gave nothing to fucking saving her.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.469
I hated him!

05:03.637 --> 05:05.681
I hated this.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.641
I wanted to destroy it.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.436
But I couldn't.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.730
Because it was Gemma.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.191
Our little girl.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.333
She's family, John.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.169
She's your family.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.056
Where are you going?

05:47.056 --> 05:49.558
Were you ever going to tell me?

05:54.772 --> 05:56.523
How could I?

06:01.779 --> 06:05.157
I'll move into Gemma's room
until I can find somewhere in town.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.421
Please lodge the papers today,
with the court.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.216
And... just me.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.967
Not with John.

06:27.012 --> 06:30.140
It doesn't have top be sole custody,
I just...

06:32.059 --> 06:34.728
I want to be a part of Alice's life.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.779
We're putting Agnes's things back.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.405
I'll need a hand with the desk.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.908
You should have left things
the way they were in the first place.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.743
She's only going to have
more questions now.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.954
-  We'll see.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.587
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.719
What are you doing?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.096
You can't just ignore it.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.890
She's lodged a court application.
She wants to speak with her.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.184
She can request whatever she wants.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.103
We don't have to agree to it.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.982
These things don't just go away, June.

07:21.275 --> 07:24.361
They can come here,
whether you like it or not.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.196
And then what's going to happen?

07:26.196 --> 07:29.950
They see your face like that,
Alice not speaking, hating us.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.994
I know how these things go.

07:33.036 --> 07:37.708
We just need to buy some time
with Alice,

07:37.708 --> 07:39.585
and get her better.

07:41.503 --> 07:42.963
Sure.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.742
Dear Alice,

09:35.742 --> 09:37.786
You've every right to be mad at me

09:37.786 --> 09:40.539
for not telling you
the truth about Agnes.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.793
I was hoping to give you, and all of us,

09:44.793 --> 09:47.254
a chance to start over.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.136
Agnes came to Thornfield after
her parents died in a car accident.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.518
She was an orphan, like you.

10:01.518 --> 10:05.230
And she lived in the belltower,
like you.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.566
I loved her very much.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.703
Thornfield became her home.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.247
Her love of flowers bloomed here.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.083
She learned the dictionary by heart.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.836
And it's also where she met your dad,

10:27.836 --> 10:29.546
and they fell in love.

10:40.515 --> 10:44.269
The flower on this locket
is a Sturt's Desert Pea.

10:44.269 --> 10:48.398
It means 'have courage, take heart'.

10:55.697 --> 10:59.034
That's what we both
need to do now, Alice.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.912
Just like you've lost your voice,

11:01.912 --> 11:03.955
I've lost mine.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.666
I'm still grieving for them both,

11:06.666 --> 11:08.418
as you are.

11:09.920 --> 11:14.674
But I promise to give you all those
answers once you start speaking.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.762
I need you to find your voice
so I can find mine.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.057
Can you do that for me?

11:39.282 --> 11:41.076
[whispers] Go on.

11:42.452 --> 11:46.915
Thank you, Alice.
Interesting sentiments.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.757
Answers when you speak.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.176
Right?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.186
In your celibacy I trust.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.357
- Better than 'I hate your guts'.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.127
Teeth brushed?

12:32.127 --> 12:34.337
Oh, good.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.964
Come on.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.596
Oh, it's beautiful.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.306
You're a lucky girl.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.480
Yeah. We're all friends here.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.025
Hey, it's your birthday soon.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.736
You'll have to think of
what cake you want, OK?

12:57.736 --> 12:58.904
Yeah?

12:58.904 --> 13:00.155
OK.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.862
Mr Wheeler, I don't want this
to get horrible.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.531
I just want to speak to Alice.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.408
Or June, even.

15:11.328 --> 15:15.040
There... There are certain things that
I... I could tell Alice,

15:15.040 --> 15:18.585
about her parents,
that I think might help her.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.448
Good job.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.929
I'm... sorry.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.931
I... should have asked.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.516
I've just never read it.

16:32.909 --> 16:36.037
It's just a stupid dare,
when we were kids.

16:58.143 --> 17:01.396
I only know what June told
Clem and I when we were little.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.898
She called him the Robber Baron.

17:06.317 --> 17:10.280
They met at the river.
She was swimming.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.990
She saw smoke,

17:11.990 --> 17:14.492
and there he was,
camped out in a swag.

17:14.492 --> 17:19.372
They spent this magical day together,
and then he disappeared.

17:19.372 --> 17:24.085
Then, the next month, she saw smoke,
and there he was again.

17:24.085 --> 17:28.673
And every month, on the same day,
they'd meet.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.676
And then, one day, he wasn't there.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.846
June had heard that
the cops had caught these robbers

17:34.846 --> 17:38.516
who were stealing from the rich
to give to the local poor.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.066
Mm-hm.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.401
And June was pregnant with Clem,

17:48.401 --> 17:51.070
but she never saw
her Robber Baron again.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.592
Is that so hard to believe?

18:31.694 --> 18:35.782
The farm wouldn't survive
without our bees.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.785
They're the beating heart
of this whole place.

18:38.785 --> 18:43.581
And when you taste their honey,
you're tasting our flowers.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.587
And I believe this honey
can cure just about anything.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.179
Mmm!

18:59.556 --> 19:01.808
Mm-yum-yum-yum.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.196
Rosemary - remembrance.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.906
Marigold - grief.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.701
Basil - hatred.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.287
Don't know what the Italians
would say to that.

19:25.790 --> 19:30.253
Kangaroo paw - childhood games and play.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.856
Flannel flower.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.567
Look it up.

20:18.259 --> 20:22.388
"I am your captive.
I declare against you!

20:25.391 --> 20:27.226
"Sarcastic!

20:28.895 --> 20:30.939
"Laziness.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.024
"Stupidity!

20:34.067 --> 20:35.985
"I surrender!

20:37.570 --> 20:39.614
"My gratitude!

20:44.744 --> 20:47.830
"Ambassador of love!"

20:47.830 --> 20:49.123
June!

20:59.217 --> 21:00.969
New flower.

21:00.969 --> 21:04.138
Come on big fella. Oh! Good boy.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.058
I don't have anything for him.
He's hungry.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.727
I'll take care of it.
Are you both OK?

21:09.727 --> 21:13.398
We have a female GP
we can call if you need.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.984
- Anyone know you're here?

21:15.984 --> 21:17.568
Good.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.946
- You're safe here.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.364
So is he.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.242
You're not alone.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.912
I'm here.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.541
Yes, Joshie!

21:31.541 --> 21:34.377
I used to do this for your dad.

21:34.377 --> 21:37.380
Except he'd be crying the whole time.

21:37.380 --> 21:43.094
Hello. Yes! Oh, good boy.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.155
What's your name?

23:14.435 --> 23:15.937
Alice...

24:09.824 --> 24:10.908
Fuck you!

24:36.184 --> 24:42.023
- What's in it?
- Uh, one's apricot, and one is kiwi.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.441
Oh!

24:43.441 --> 24:45.651
Oh, there she is.
How are you feeling?

24:45.651 --> 24:47.195
Yeah, alright.

24:47.195 --> 24:49.030
I think he's missing home a bit.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.531
Never been away before.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.159
Yeah, it's a lot
of new people to take in.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.994
- But he'll settle.
- Do you want a seat?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.204
Uh, no, um...

24:56.204 --> 24:58.414
Uh, I need my phone.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.042
I need to make some calls.
He'll be looking for me.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.753
All communication
comes through me or Twig.

25:03.753 --> 25:08.841
It's so this place can stay safe,
and hidden.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.843
So you always have it to come back to.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.512
Say the word,
and we'll get you out in the field.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.431
Sunshine, hard work -

25:15.431 --> 25:17.475
put some money in your pocket.

25:17.475 --> 25:20.311
- You guys get money?
- Yeah. If you work, you get paid.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.355
Yep. Every woman
needs her own money.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.898
- Running away money.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.441
Shh.

25:25.441 --> 25:28.444
Come, sit, eat.
I'll take him.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.446
- Come.

25:39.830 --> 25:43.459
And this one always makes me
think about my little boy, Johnny.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.712
He had big eyes like you.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.257
Big heart.

25:51.384 --> 25:56.055
And that one is just like my girl, Nina,
beautiful and strong.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.974
So when I'm sad, or just missing them,

25:57.974 --> 26:00.977
I come out here, to be with them.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.770
They're beautiful, eh?

26:13.030 --> 26:14.949
No idea.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.826
They were taken from me.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.745
'Cause I'm a blackfella.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.915
And I was young and poor,

26:22.915 --> 26:25.084
and that's just what they did
in this country.

26:27.378 --> 26:28.713
Oh...

26:28.713 --> 26:30.006
Bless you.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.636
You see these little trees?

26:35.636 --> 26:38.431
They're for your family.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.474
That one's for your dad.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.601
That one's for your mum.

26:42.601 --> 26:46.689
And that one's...
for your baby brother.

27:21.849 --> 27:24.060
I'm so sorry, bub.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.991
It's not your fault, sweetheart.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.311
- Go, Dina!
- Yes!

28:49.311 --> 28:52.648
- Oh, my God!

28:52.648 --> 28:54.859
Can't believe I actually did that.

28:57.611 --> 29:01.657
- Good girl.
- All women need to know how to drive.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.409
- Mm.
- Yeah.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.620
Alice.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.080
You're next.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.084
Come on. Get up here.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.837
No time like the present.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.842
You can't be any worse than me.

29:19.842 --> 29:21.427
Oh, God, I can't look.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.512
- You've got this, Alice!

29:33.939 --> 29:36.650
Slowly...

29:38.152 --> 29:40.237
That's good. That's good.

29:40.237 --> 29:43.782
Alright, so, clutch all the way in.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.577
And pull it down to second.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.370
Very good. Oops!

29:48.370 --> 29:50.122
Then you let the clutch out slowly,

29:50.122 --> 29:52.041
and press down on the accelerator.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.127
Gently. Gently.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.337
Oof!

29:57.671 --> 30:00.049
Don't ride the clutch.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.926
- Very good.

30:01.926 --> 30:04.053
It's good that they see us coming.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.903
Oh, good girl, Alice.

30:26.700 --> 30:31.372
Good, Alice.
You can drive us to town tomorrow, hey?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.558
All good?

30:50.558 --> 30:52.351
Yeah.

30:52.351 --> 30:56.021
Oh, no, thank you. I...
should probably go and lie down.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.148
- It's been a long drive.
- OK.

30:59.817 --> 31:01.318
Hey, uh...

31:01.318 --> 31:05.614
Do you of a place around here
called Thornfield?

31:05.614 --> 31:08.117
It's a flower farm, apparently.

31:11.954 --> 31:13.706
Are you OK?

31:14.748 --> 31:18.085
Yeah. Why w...
Why wouldn't I be?

31:19.169 --> 31:21.338
Ah.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.549
It's not open to the public.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.637
I actually know June Hart a little.

31:29.972 --> 31:33.100
We met at the hospital
when her granddaughter was there

31:33.100 --> 31:34.602
a little while ago.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.439
- Alice?
- Alice.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.983
Yes. Do you know her?

31:46.113 --> 31:49.283
Maybe best to call ahead, hm?

31:50.326 --> 31:51.577
Oggi.

32:08.636 --> 32:10.512
It's no problem at all.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.640
We'll get the flowers out tomorrow.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.267
Thanks for the call.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.647
Hey, while I've got you, um,

32:19.647 --> 32:22.316
there's some money missing
from our business account.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.070
- Ten grand.
- Oh, yeah, that's me.

32:26.070 --> 32:30.491
I, uh, I put a lawyer on retainer,
in case we need it for Alice.

32:30.491 --> 32:31.909
Oh...

32:31.909 --> 32:33.577
Thank you.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.583
Don't stay up late.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.769
Hi, Oggi!

33:45.274 --> 33:47.443
I think we have a visitor.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.892
Ugh...

34:19.892 --> 34:22.686
Oh! God...

34:22.686 --> 34:24.438
What do you want, Sally?

34:24.438 --> 34:29.193
I... I figured, because you won't have
any normal communication,

34:29.193 --> 34:30.652
that I... I'd...

34:30.652 --> 34:33.197
- Harry.
- I'm just trying... I've come...

34:36.533 --> 34:38.076
What do you want here?

34:41.330 --> 34:43.081
I want to see Alice.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.209
Not going to happen.

34:45.209 --> 34:46.835
Why?

34:46.835 --> 34:49.046
I just want to see that she's OK.

34:49.046 --> 34:52.299
It's her birthday soon.
I've brought her a present.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.343
You need to leave.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.096
Is she even talking yet?

34:59.640 --> 35:03.393
It's trauma.
She's lost her whole family.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.562
No, she hasn't.

35:15.697 --> 35:18.075
What's it going to take
to make you back off?

35:18.075 --> 35:20.661
I don't want anything out of this.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.164
I just want what's best for her.

35:24.164 --> 35:26.917
And I'm not leaving until I talk to her.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.613
What do you see?

35:58.699 --> 36:00.117
Flowers.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.621
Women.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.665
Only women.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.211
Thornfield is a flower farm.

36:11.211 --> 36:15.966
It's also a safe place
for women to come and to heal.

36:17.885 --> 36:20.387
- This is a refuge.
- Mm-hm.

36:20.387 --> 36:24.182
And all of your poking about
with police and lawyers

36:24.182 --> 36:26.476
puts all of it at risk.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.813
Every woman here.

36:35.444 --> 36:37.821
We love Alice.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.573
We're looking after her.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.409
It's what we do here.

36:44.036 --> 36:46.914
Now, do you really want to
jeopardise all of this,

36:46.914 --> 36:48.916
and Alice

36:48.916 --> 36:50.918
for your own needs?

36:52.920 --> 36:54.963
We're both on that will.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.966
Agnes trusted me.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.136
I respect what you're doing,

37:01.136 --> 37:06.475
but do you really think that a refuge
full of damaged, traumatised people

37:06.475 --> 37:08.602
is the best place for her?

37:14.024 --> 37:16.652
Maybe we should ask Alice
what she wants.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.111
Not you.

37:18.111 --> 37:19.488
Not me.

37:19.488 --> 37:20.906
Alice.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.216
Alice.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.968
Oh!

37:40.968 --> 37:43.178
Hi.

37:43.178 --> 37:46.264
It's so good to see you.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.393
It's OK. Your grandmother and I
just wanted to talk to you.

37:51.019 --> 37:55.065
It's all fine. We just want to make sure
that you're feeling OK here.

38:00.654 --> 38:02.072
It's OK.

38:02.072 --> 38:03.949
I didn't mean to scare you.

39:42.005 --> 39:47.427
I've been chasing this thing
that's not real.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.471
Gemma,

39:49.471 --> 39:51.181
Alice...

39:55.060 --> 39:57.354
And I've fucked everything.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.691
John...

40:04.319 --> 40:07.322
I don't want to lose you.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.241
I don't want to lose you.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.055
-  Alice...

40:42.107 --> 40:43.775
Happy birthday.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.535
Said something about
Joshie and his fa...

40:53.535 --> 40:55.871
Here she is!

40:55.871 --> 40:58.874
Happy birthday, Alice.

40:58.874 --> 41:00.750
Happy birthday, sweetpea.

41:02.419 --> 41:04.754
- Here.

41:07.841 --> 41:09.676
Happy birthday, Alice.

41:49.758 --> 41:53.345
Dina decided she and Joshie
needed to go home.

41:53.345 --> 41:55.263
We can't blame her.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.558
She thinks Joshie needs his dad.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.898
Alice...

42:53.446 --> 42:55.407
Mummy!

42:55.407 --> 42:57.242
Mummy!

42:58.618 --> 43:00.870
I'm so sorry, Alice.

43:11.756 --> 43:13.633
I'm here now.

43:33.069 --> 43:34.321
Hello.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.579
June, it's someone
calling from a hospital.

43:42.579 --> 43:44.039
They said it's urgent.

43:45.248 --> 43:47.125
Shit. Dina.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.632
June Hart.

44:00.096 --> 44:02.349
Uh, hold on a second.

44:03.725 --> 44:05.560
- It's not about Dina.
- Oh.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.645
It's Alice's doctor. I'll...

44:07.645 --> 44:10.065
OK, then.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.529
- Sorry about that.
- That's OK.

44:16.529 --> 44:20.450
Look, as promised, I just want to
update you on your grandson's surgery.

44:20.450 --> 44:22.160
It went really well.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.914
He's breathing on his own.
All his vitals are strong.

44:25.914 --> 44:28.041
He's not out of the woods quite yet,

44:28.041 --> 44:30.752
but, it's time for him to come home.

44:30.752 --> 44:32.295
I see.

44:32.295 --> 44:35.215
What he needs now is to be with family.

44:35.215 --> 44:37.258
We can liaise with your local hospital

44:37.258 --> 44:40.345
and do any follow-up treatment
he might need.

44:40.345 --> 44:45.100
Um... I'll make arrangements.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.768
Thank you.

45:30.186 --> 45:31.980
Happy birthday.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.412
Alright.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.164
Nazdrave!

45:58.339 --> 46:03.052
Well, um, that bit's gross,
but adults love it.

46:15.732 --> 46:19.235
It's about a girl from the sea
who loses her voice.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.576
Thank you.

46:26.576 --> 46:28.828
Oh! Uh...

46:28.828 --> 46:30.747
Whoa.

46:30.747 --> 46:32.707
Words just came out of your mouth!

46:34.792 --> 46:36.377
Say something else.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.798
Something else.

46:45.678 --> 46:51.142
♪ ...birthday, dear Alice ♪

46:51.142 --> 46:56.731
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪

46:56.731 --> 46:58.691
Make a wish, sweetpea!

47:05.823 --> 47:07.700
Hooray!

47:07.700 --> 47:09.118
Hooray!

47:09.118 --> 47:11.329
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

47:16.000 --> 47:17.252
Thank you.

47:17.252 --> 47:19.837
-  Alice, you spoke!

47:19.837 --> 47:21.965
Yes, I did.

47:21.965 --> 47:24.592
You have a voice! Oh, what a voice!

47:24.592 --> 47:26.761
- Say my name.
- Boo!

47:30.306 --> 47:33.017
- Good girl!
- Say my name - Stella.

47:33.017 --> 47:35.895
- Stella!

47:35.895 --> 47:38.064
Oh, my God, so great!

47:38.064 --> 47:39.774
Hello.

47:39.774 --> 47:43.736
-  Can we have cake?
-  Yes.

48:09.679 --> 48:11.431
I'm sorry.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.310
For everything.

48:16.811 --> 48:18.271
I know.

48:20.815 --> 48:22.984
I know you are.

48:32.368 --> 48:34.954
I've been thinking...

48:38.583 --> 48:40.668
I miss Gem.

48:42.503 --> 48:45.381
But I also miss being a dad.

48:47.634 --> 48:49.552
Being a family.

48:54.098 --> 48:56.517
It's not too late for us.

49:00.396 --> 49:02.106
No more lies.

49:04.859 --> 49:06.944
That's the only way this can work.

49:13.034 --> 49:14.869
No more lies.

49:17.497 --> 49:20.041
You said they were in love.

49:20.041 --> 49:22.752
They were happy here.

49:22.752 --> 49:24.712
They were.

49:24.712 --> 49:29.550
Your father was making plans
for their future at Thornfield.

49:29.550 --> 49:31.886
And I had to remind him

49:31.886 --> 49:35.306
that the farm could only go to
the women in our family.

49:36.933 --> 49:39.560
And he didn't like that.

49:39.560 --> 49:42.105
We argued.

49:42.105 --> 49:44.482
And he took you mother and went away.

49:45.525 --> 49:46.901
Why was he like that?

49:48.736 --> 49:50.321
I don't know.

49:50.321 --> 49:53.408
As a child,
he could be sensitive and kind.

49:53.408 --> 49:57.203
And he created these
extraordinary things with his hands.

49:58.955 --> 50:03.751
But there was a kind of damage in him
that I started to see.

50:03.751 --> 50:06.170
Maybe it came from his father.

50:06.170 --> 50:07.714
Robber Baron?

50:07.714 --> 50:09.424
You loved him.

50:12.218 --> 50:16.264
If you knew he had this damage in him,
why didn't you try and find us?

50:16.264 --> 50:18.391
I did try, many times.

50:18.391 --> 50:22.729
But... they just disappeared that day,

50:22.729 --> 50:26.941
and we only heard from them once
after that -

50:26.941 --> 50:28.526
when you were born.

50:30.445 --> 50:36.409
He sent us
this carving of you, as a baby,

50:36.409 --> 50:38.286
with your name on it.

50:41.706 --> 50:44.375
You knew he was hurting us?

50:44.375 --> 50:47.170
No. And not saving you...

50:48.713 --> 50:51.591
...is something I'll regret
for the rest of my life.

50:54.135 --> 50:57.221
I think Oggi's out there still.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.432
Come on. Let's go find him.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.060
Come on.

51:10.443 --> 51:13.279
There's plenty of time
to tell her the rest.

51:14.489 --> 51:15.865
Later.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.592
- Rah!

52:18.177 --> 52:21.222
No-one gets us.

52:21.222 --> 52:22.807
You know that, right?

52:25.184 --> 52:29.188
You and me, we're stitched together.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.940
My name next.

53:12.940 --> 53:15.318
Carve it in the tree for me, Oggi?

54:02.114 --> 54:03.741
Um...

54:05.660 --> 54:08.287
Sergeant John Morgan, please.

54:09.580 --> 54:12.124
Yes. It's urgent.
