00:19.691 --> 00:21.684
(Wild cheering)

00:30.118 --> 00:31.862
Changing $100.

00:31.995 --> 00:33.739
Change $100. Go ahead.

00:33.872 --> 00:36.161
All right, baby. Big Eight. Big Eight.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.580
No more bets

00:47.844 --> 00:50.964
Section G3 all clear.
En route to H4, and then soft count.

00:52.849 --> 00:55.305
New dealer. Coming in.

00:58.522 --> 01:00.431
Double zero.

01:08.865 --> 01:09.980
(Screaming)

01:18.542 --> 01:21.993
Section G4. Security Three. Intercept at G5.

01:22.129 --> 01:23.872
Contain. Contain.

01:35.684 --> 01:37.143
And the body count?

01:37.269 --> 01:40.104
Five guards, three civilians wounded,
one dead bad guy.

01:40.230 --> 01:45.141
Armed robbers snatched the lock boxes from the
two high-stakes tables right off the rolling cage.

01:45.277 --> 01:47.815
- Cash on wheels.
- Yeah, the busiest time of night.

01:47.946 --> 01:50.022
Three women. Organised and muscled.

01:50.157 --> 01:51.948
Small-time crook s, Jim.

01:52.075 --> 01:54.068
Hey, they got away with 250K.

01:54.202 --> 01:56.954
Yeah. That's a mere pittance to a Vegas casino.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.200
The cashiers alone
are sitting on a million in change.

02:00.334 --> 02:02.125
Small-time or not,

02:02.252 --> 02:04.126
these ladies are dangerous.

02:07.591 --> 02:09.418
Dangerous? Yes.

02:09.550 --> 02:11.259
Ladies?

02:13.347 --> 02:15.007
No.

02:54.638 --> 02:56.630
(Camera whirs)

02:59.851 --> 03:01.559
These guys packed enough 45 ammo

03:01.687 --> 03:03.264
for a small army

03:03.397 --> 03:07.940
Well, security managed to return a few rounds,
9mm.

03:08.068 --> 03:11.519
Less than a year ago,
security couldn't even carry guns.

03:11.655 --> 03:13.861
- Times have changed.
- Yeah.

03:15.742 --> 03:18.660
The same MO as Laughlin.
Last month. The Cottage Casino.

03:18.787 --> 03:22.322
Men dressed as women.
Shot the place to hell. In and out in under five.

03:22.457 --> 03:24.948
My bet is that that was the practice run.

03:25.085 --> 03:28.668
- And the more you practise...
- What the hell is going on with the world?

03:28.797 --> 03:31.798
Everything's crazy.
Now I risk my life just coming into work.

03:31.925 --> 03:35.377
Makes you miss the mob days.
Back then, this never would have happened.

03:35.512 --> 03:38.963
And if it did, those scumbags, they'd be dead,
every last one of them.

03:39.099 --> 03:41.092
And you would never know about it.

03:41.226 --> 03:46.018
Mr Duncan, take a deep breath
and tell us what happened.

03:46.148 --> 03:49.065
We'd just made a money transfer
to the rolling cages.

03:49.192 --> 03:50.272
Then "bang"

03:50.402 --> 03:52.940
the chandelier
comes crashing down

03:53.071 --> 03:57.151
It sounded like an explosion,
so I dropped to my knees, took cover.

03:57.284 --> 03:58.446
Anything else?

03:58.577 --> 04:01.246
Yeah, I started praying for the gunfire to stop.

04:01.330 --> 04:04.912
OK. Thanks a lot. And check in with Triage
before you leave.

04:08.337 --> 04:11.088
- Well, that was helpful.
- Actually, it was.

04:12.758 --> 04:15.083
It gives us a starting point

04:15.218 --> 04:18.837
The falling chandelier distracts the guards
and makes them easy targets

04:20.766 --> 04:23.601
The armed robbers load up,
head for the exits.

04:23.727 --> 04:25.305
A quick escape.

04:25.437 --> 04:28.972
Chaos moving in one direction,
the money moving in the other.

04:37.491 --> 04:39.483
Can you imagine living out here?

04:39.618 --> 04:40.863
It's peaceful.

04:40.994 --> 04:44.862
Peaceful?
The town just lost 5% of its population.

04:44.998 --> 04:48.913
- I thought you said this was a single homicide.
- Yeah.

04:49.044 --> 04:51.369
In a population of 20.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.009
Made it. State trooper.

05:03.392 --> 05:04.969
Woo

05:08.647 --> 05:11.019
Two hours to drive T5 miles?

05:12.484 --> 05:14.062
You guys got lost.

05:15.279 --> 05:18.030
What's the rush?
The crime scene's not going anywhere.

05:18.156 --> 05:21.193
Yeah, but I am. The body's behind the counter.

05:21.326 --> 05:22.785
Dustin Bale

05:22.911 --> 05:26.909
Store clerk. Bullet through the chest.
The register's empty.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.578
Officer... Spencer, did you touch anything?

05:29.710 --> 05:33.957
14 years as a state trooper. I can secure a crime
scene without contaminating the evidence.

05:34.089 --> 05:35.916
Sorry.

05:36.049 --> 05:37.543
It's OK.

05:37.676 --> 05:40.712
Look, I cover 9T.5 square miles. I gotta book.

06:02.868 --> 06:03.817
Vomit?

06:09.708 --> 06:12.744
Not an expectorant. Potato.

06:12.878 --> 06:13.909
Blown to smithereens.

06:14.046 --> 06:16.750
The poor man's silencer.

06:19.843 --> 06:21.006
Now...

06:21.136 --> 06:24.754
why would an assailant
need a silencer way out here?

06:42.324 --> 06:44.032
The last paying customer?

06:44.159 --> 06:45.357
Eight hours ago.

06:46.495 --> 06:50.445
We just got the call. This place is open 24/T.
Why'd it take so long?

06:53.293 --> 06:57.623
The assailant flipped the sign
on the way out, buying him time to get away.

06:59.925 --> 07:04.254
But not without getting his picture taken first.

07:17.734 --> 07:19.312
It's plastic.

07:19.444 --> 07:21.603
You're joking?

07:22.823 --> 07:25.029
A nine volt attached to a blinking light.

07:26.201 --> 07:28.657
Well... real or fake,

07:28.787 --> 07:30.198
it didn't work.

07:30.330 --> 07:33.746
There was three of 'em.
They come from round the corner, guns drawn.

07:37.129 --> 07:40.663
I think they came from over there.
There were two of them.

07:41.883 --> 07:43.378
I said four

07:43.510 --> 07:46.844
There were four of those lunatics.
They were everywhere.

07:46.972 --> 07:50.092
- Write it down.
- Right, I got it. Thank you. Excuse me.

07:51.852 --> 07:53.975
You know, I've interviewed 1 T people.

07:54.104 --> 07:56.677
No two accounts are alike.

07:56.815 --> 08:01.607
A professor got students to watch a basketball
game, count the times the ball was passed.

08:01.737 --> 08:04.406
- Yeah? Ground-breaking.
- During the game,

08:04.489 --> 08:06.945
a person in a gorilla suit ran across the court.

08:07.075 --> 08:08.617
Afterwards,

08:08.744 --> 08:13.655
the professor asked them if they noticed
the gorilla. 50% responded, "What gorilla?"

08:13.790 --> 08:16.460
That's wonderful.
If I see a gorilla, I'll arrest him.

08:18.337 --> 08:20.329
The car was sitting right here.

08:21.548 --> 08:24.217
Did you get a good look at it? Make? Model?

08:24.343 --> 08:25.125
No.

08:25.260 --> 08:27.965
It was beige. Beat-up. Hazards flashing.

08:28.096 --> 08:30.219
People leave their cars here all the time.

08:30.349 --> 08:32.258
I wait ten minutes, then call for a tow.

08:32.392 --> 08:34.349
- Did the car peel out?
- No

08:34.477 --> 08:36.517
The driver gunned it. I didn't hear a screech.

08:36.647 --> 08:38.224
(Car alarm)

08:47.115 --> 08:48.907
It smells like burnt wood.

08:49.034 --> 08:50.612
Motor oil?

08:50.744 --> 08:52.737
No, transmission fluid.

08:54.081 --> 08:56.073
But it's brown, not red.

08:56.208 --> 08:57.370
Which means?

08:58.585 --> 09:00.245
It's not the right colour.

09:05.717 --> 09:07.710
Extraction is an art, Albert.

09:07.844 --> 09:09.967
I like to think so.

09:10.097 --> 09:12.469
So, this is our cross-dresser in the blue coat?

09:12.599 --> 09:17.261
ID'd as Adam Brower. Shot in the back
with a hollow point. Close range.

09:17.396 --> 09:19.435
It mushroomed upon impact,

09:19.564 --> 09:21.522
maximising trauma.

09:24.403 --> 09:25.861
Calibre?

09:25.988 --> 09:27.980
.45.

09:28.115 --> 09:30.606
Well, the guards were armed with 9mm

09:30.742 --> 09:32.735
and they weren't hollow point.

09:32.869 --> 09:34.328
So...

09:34.454 --> 09:37.823
He was shot in the back
by one of his own partners?

09:37.958 --> 09:39.333
Someone didn't want to share.

09:47.092 --> 09:48.800
Wow. A fumette.

09:48.927 --> 09:51.845
- Did you get that out of some museum?
- Hey don't knock it

09:51.972 --> 09:54.545
Still the best tool for lifting prints off cardboard.

09:56.852 --> 09:58.476
Blow and print.

10:00.856 --> 10:04.474
If you were in a hurry,
how would you get back there?

10:04.610 --> 10:06.068
Easy.

10:07.404 --> 10:08.982
Jump the counter.

10:09.114 --> 10:10.822
Exactly what I'm thinking.

10:50.864 --> 10:52.442
Shoe prints.

10:52.574 --> 10:54.282
Lay it out.

10:54.409 --> 10:56.735
The suspect entered.

10:59.456 --> 11:01.365
He snoots the clerk through the potato

11:03.210 --> 11:06.211
Then hops up and over
leaving behind shoe prints

11:06.338 --> 11:08.129
He grabs the cash

11:08.257 --> 11:11.257
flips the sign from "open" to "closed" and exits

11:12.386 --> 11:13.844
How old's the killer?

11:13.971 --> 11:15.714
What are you thinking?

11:15.847 --> 11:18.718
The shoe size is five, six, tops.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.053
We may be looking for a minor.

11:22.187 --> 11:23.765
You want to see me?

11:23.897 --> 11:25.060
Yeah.

11:25.190 --> 11:27.764
This is the video surveillance from that heist.

11:27.901 --> 11:30.190
This camera was trained on their entrance.

11:31.321 --> 11:34.441
All the disguises in the world
and they dress like women.

11:34.574 --> 11:36.152
Ski masks are played out.

11:37.786 --> 11:40.704
Red and Blue teamed up together

11:40.831 --> 11:44.663
and took out the guards in the rolling cage.
Black shot down that chandelier.

11:44.793 --> 11:46.786
Well, Blue's the decedent,

11:46.920 --> 11:49.209
ID'd as Adam Brower,

11:49.339 --> 11:50.750
so enlarge Red.

11:52.217 --> 11:54.257
Yeah, no amount of make-up in the world

11:54.386 --> 11:56.544
can cover up that chunk of Adam's apple.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.716
That must be the one that killed Brower.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.973
A.45 in the back at close range.

12:04.396 --> 12:06.187
No honour among thieves.

12:06.315 --> 12:08.023
Photoshop black.

12:12.195 --> 12:13.773
No stubble.

12:13.905 --> 12:17.321
- No Adam's apple.
- Dressed as a woman

12:17.451 --> 12:19.443
Among men dressed as women.

12:20.662 --> 12:22.869
Now, see? That's a disguise.

12:33.091 --> 12:34.669
Fluorescent powders?

12:34.801 --> 12:37.090
Yeah. Why not? They're in the kit.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.094
The protocol's black.

12:39.222 --> 12:41.927
Since when do you care
about my choice of powders?

12:42.059 --> 12:47.515
The Assistant Coroner is four hours late and we
are stuck out here until he transports the body,

12:47.648 --> 12:49.854
and I haven't even heard from Grissom.

12:49.983 --> 12:51.857
You know, I've never tried green.

12:51.985 --> 12:55.105
I shouldn't have been sent here.
I've got seniority. I deserve...

12:55.238 --> 12:58.275
no I've earned the right to pick my cases

13:07.709 --> 13:09.702
If I start eating, I will shut up.

13:12.214 --> 13:13.791
Do you have a mirror?

13:13.924 --> 13:16.166
Since when do you care
about your appearance?

13:20.013 --> 13:22.006
I mean, at a crime scene.

13:22.140 --> 13:24.133
It's not for me.

13:24.268 --> 13:25.892
Sorry.

13:28.855 --> 13:30.231
We can't touch it.

13:30.357 --> 13:32.065
I'm just getting a better look.

13:40.993 --> 13:43.863
- Oh, thank God. It's about time.
- Nice to see you, too.

13:43.996 --> 13:46.866
Well, I smell the body. Where is he?

13:46.999 --> 13:49.371
Hey, David. I... I wasn't touching him.

13:49.501 --> 13:51.161
I know you better than that.

13:51.295 --> 13:53.750
- What took you so long?
- Made a wrong turn at the fork.

14:06.393 --> 14:09.062
- You're a surfer now?
- Oh, dude, I rip.

14:09.146 --> 14:11.352
We're 300 miles from the nearest beach.

14:12.482 --> 14:14.771
Surfing is just a state of mind.

14:15.986 --> 14:17.564
I got your page.

14:17.696 --> 14:20.863
- Where's my report?
- Relax. The GC mass spec's working on it.

14:20.991 --> 14:22.569
Should be done er...

14:22.701 --> 14:24.409
(Machine beeps)
- Now

14:26.997 --> 14:28.408
Transmission fluid.

14:28.540 --> 14:30.248
Yeah. Thanks.

14:32.169 --> 14:33.960
Type F with Dexron.

14:34.087 --> 14:37.124
- So?
- So...

14:37.257 --> 14:40.460
You should be reading Car And Driver
instead of Sand & Surf.

14:40.594 --> 14:43.927
Someone put the wrong type of fluid
in the car's transmission.

14:45.057 --> 14:48.757
You see, Ford automobiles
use a thick red type F transmission fluid.

14:48.894 --> 14:51.219
General Motors uses a thinner, yellow fluid

14:51.355 --> 14:52.553
with Dexron.

14:52.689 --> 14:55.726
When Dexron's put into a Ford,
it thins that type F fluid.

14:55.859 --> 14:57.437
Friction builds, gears grind.

14:57.569 --> 15:01.353
The second gear is the first to go
Friction causes the engine to overheat

15:01.490 --> 15:04.241
in turn cooking the transmission fluid

15:04.368 --> 15:08.828
turning it brown. The leak on the pavement
is the first clue you've got a problem.

15:08.956 --> 15:11.956
Well, congratulations.
You're looking for a Ford with a leak.

15:12.084 --> 15:16.164
Not just a Ford. The getaway vehicle
has a stubborn second gear.

15:16.296 --> 15:18.455
Which means it can't get very far.

15:18.590 --> 15:20.583
My guess is it's already been dumped.

15:20.717 --> 15:24.797
Before Mr Brower dressed up
as a woman and heisted a casino,

15:24.930 --> 15:28.133
he was a janitor at an office park off Flamingo.

15:28.267 --> 15:29.465
Before that,

15:29.601 --> 15:31.808
he was out of town.

15:31.937 --> 15:33.431
Four years, grand larceny.

15:35.607 --> 15:37.766
Well, the manager's not in.

15:37.901 --> 15:39.775
I got a warrant.

15:39.903 --> 15:41.101
I got a key.

15:48.370 --> 15:51.039
Woo. A tidy little camper, isn't he?

15:51.123 --> 15:52.831
Yean

16:00.340 --> 16:02.878
- What are we looking for?
- Anything that links Brower

16:03.010 --> 16:04.587
to his co-conspirators.

16:15.522 --> 16:16.897
Dirty laundry?

16:17.024 --> 16:21.567
I'm thinking trace elements in the clothes
could tell us where he was before the heist.

16:22.946 --> 16:25.864
Let's take it all back to the lab.

16:25.991 --> 16:27.154
OK.

16:29.411 --> 16:30.870
Let's see.

16:47.220 --> 16:48.928
Well, while you're at it,

16:49.056 --> 16:51.048
don't forget his wigs and bras.

17:17.917 --> 17:19.910
Anything on the shoe print?

17:20.045 --> 17:22.038
Skechers. Adult size five.

17:22.172 --> 17:25.042
Female
- Well, at least we're not chasing a kid.

17:25.175 --> 17:27.084
How's the prints coming?

17:27.219 --> 17:30.718
You two lifted 82 suspect prints. 43 are partial.

17:30.847 --> 17:33.385
We ID'd one from the "open/closed" sign.

17:33.517 --> 17:36.434
- Great.
- Well, not so great. The state trooper.

17:36.561 --> 17:39.812
You gotta be kidding me.
Officer Moron contaminated the scene?

17:39.940 --> 17:43.107
Yep. Well, I'll just beef him to his captain.

17:43.235 --> 17:44.266
Tough.

17:44.403 --> 17:45.565
I like that.

17:46.738 --> 17:48.149
Match

17:48.282 --> 17:50.773
- Print off the register
- What have you got?

17:54.413 --> 17:57.663
- Tammy Felton.
- Who's Tammy Felton?

17:57.791 --> 18:00.662
A fugitive... and clinical psychopath

18:00.794 --> 18:03.000
that Grissom and I put behind bars

18:03.130 --> 18:05.965
She tried to play me, but I didn't bite.

18:11.805 --> 18:15.506
Her biological parents posted bail
and then she bailed on them.

18:15.642 --> 18:19.474
- Biological parents?
- Tammy was kidnapped as a child

18:19.605 --> 18:21.597
and raised by her kidnapper.

18:21.732 --> 18:24.020
When she found out the truth, she killed him.

18:28.530 --> 18:30.321
Hey, finish running the prints.

18:32.409 --> 18:34.485
Tammy uses people. She wasn't alone.

18:36.121 --> 18:37.580
Grissom!

18:37.706 --> 18:41.407
If you're gonna badger me about
your crime scene location, put it in a memo.

18:41.543 --> 18:43.121
You don't read memos.

18:43.253 --> 18:46.836
- Do you remember Tammy Felton?
- I always remember the ones that get away.

18:46.965 --> 18:48.792
She's back.

18:48.926 --> 18:50.835
And she's been to CalNevAri.

18:50.969 --> 18:53.804
She's a prime suspect
in our convenience store homicide.

18:53.931 --> 18:55.093
Grissom.

18:55.223 --> 18:57.216
I need you. ASAP.

18:57.351 --> 18:58.299
Please.

19:02.147 --> 19:05.397
So, Ballistics sent me a bullet
from the casino.

19:05.525 --> 19:08.977
It's a.45, so we know it came
from one of the ladies' guns.

19:09.112 --> 19:11.782
- And this is a special bullet?
- No.

19:11.865 --> 19:14.154
But there was a foreign substance adhered to it.

19:14.284 --> 19:15.565
The substance is special?

19:15.702 --> 19:18.988
- Er, not exactly.
- Just get to the point, Greg.

19:19.122 --> 19:20.700
To-may-to. To-mar-to.

19:20.832 --> 19:22.742
- Po-tay-to...
- Wait a second.

19:22.876 --> 19:24.833
There was potato on the bullet?

19:24.962 --> 19:26.871
You bet

19:27.005 --> 19:29.247
- Strange, huh?
- There was potato on the bullet

19:29.383 --> 19:32.253
because there was potato
inside the barrel of the gun.

19:32.386 --> 19:35.422
- This bullet is from my investigation.
- Right.

19:35.555 --> 19:42.092
One of your armed robbers may have used
a potato as a silencer prior to the heist.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.014
Tammy Felton?

19:48.151 --> 19:49.895
Maybe.

19:50.028 --> 19:52.602
Three armed robbers.

19:52.739 --> 19:55.444
Adam Brower killed at the scene

19:55.575 --> 19:57.402
Tammy Felton,

19:57.536 --> 19:59.528
and we're still one suspect short.

19:59.663 --> 20:00.778
Another match

20:00.914 --> 20:02.243
from the convenience store.

20:02.374 --> 20:05.957
The print on the outside doorknob
belongs to ex-con Darin Hanson.

20:10.716 --> 20:12.258
You know this guy too?

20:13.385 --> 20:15.876
He ran with Tammy's "father"

20:16.013 --> 20:17.970
Mostly from the law.

20:18.098 --> 20:22.392
So, Tammy kills "Dad"
and she and Darin Hanson run off together.

20:27.316 --> 20:30.020
A regular Bonnie and Clyde.

20:30.152 --> 20:31.432
Just what Vegas needs.

20:35.991 --> 20:38.482
Let me see, Bobby.

20:38.619 --> 20:42.403
The projectile on the left, a.45 hollow point,
courtesy of Adam Brower's back.

20:42.539 --> 20:43.820
On the right,

20:43.957 --> 20:48.536
a 45 hollow point extracted from Dustin Bale
the dead clerk at the convenience store

20:48.670 --> 20:51.624
The bullets confirm the story told by the potato.

20:51.757 --> 20:55.173
- The same gun. Two crimes. One case.
Three suspects

20:55.302 --> 20:59.631
Adam Brower, deceased.
Tammy Felton, Darin Hanson, still at large.

20:59.765 --> 21:05.720
Hey, guys. I just got a call from Brass.
We got a possible getaway vehicle off l-93.

21:05.854 --> 21:10.516
- What makes you think it's the right car?
- It's beige abandoned a '77 Mercury Cougar

21:10.651 --> 21:12.774
Mercury's a division of Ford.

21:13.904 --> 21:15.149
I'll drive.

21:29.711 --> 21:31.371
A trucker called it in.

21:31.505 --> 21:36.416
Well, if that's the getaway car, there would have
been a secondary vehicle parked nearby.

21:36.551 --> 21:38.425
Yeah. Check for treads, Jim?

21:38.553 --> 21:39.834
Yeah.

21:41.848 --> 21:43.046
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

21:58.031 --> 22:00.701
If you were stashing a car,
where would you hide it?

22:00.784 --> 22:03.109
Well, these bushes would provide good cover.

22:05.539 --> 22:06.914
Oh.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.710
Check out that dirt displacement.

22:09.835 --> 22:10.700
Yeah.

22:10.836 --> 22:12.745
Skid mark One tyre

22:18.051 --> 22:19.759
Where's the other one?

22:21.221 --> 22:22.799
There isn't one.

22:29.021 --> 22:30.598
Dirt to pavement.

22:30.731 --> 22:32.439
Then the trail goes cold.

22:34.693 --> 22:36.816
No damage. This car was barely moving.

22:36.945 --> 22:38.404
It was dumped.

22:39.531 --> 22:40.776
Detail.

22:40.907 --> 22:43.114
Pop the trunk

22:48.290 --> 22:49.452
Thanks.

22:56.632 --> 22:58.209
It's Tammy.

23:03.096 --> 23:05.089
Contusions on the anterior neck.

23:05.223 --> 23:07.631
Streaking erythema on the lateral aspect

23:07.768 --> 23:09.310
of zone one

23:09.436 --> 23:11.642
Cartilaginous tracheal rings are crushed.

23:12.940 --> 23:14.102
Hey, doc.

23:14.232 --> 23:15.395
Catherine.

23:17.444 --> 23:20.149
She didn't put up a fight, did she?

23:20.280 --> 23:21.691
How'd you know?

23:21.823 --> 23:24.528
She was killed
by the one person in life she trusted.

23:34.628 --> 23:35.873
Ahh!

23:36.004 --> 23:40.168
Darin Hanson stared her in the face
and she never saw it coming.

23:40.300 --> 23:43.218
He put his thumbs around her air pipe
and pushed.

23:47.808 --> 23:49.765
I swabbed her neck.

23:49.893 --> 23:51.886
Affirmative for epithelials.

23:52.020 --> 23:55.140
I'll run them against Darin Hanson's DNA.

23:55.274 --> 23:57.847
The parents called. They're on their way in to ID.

23:57.985 --> 24:00.310
How did they sound?

24:00.445 --> 24:02.023
Oddly... relieved.

24:05.534 --> 24:07.526
They finally know where she is.

24:17.671 --> 24:19.710
I'm not pulling it.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.331
I found similar dust
on Adam Brower's dirty clothes.

24:22.467 --> 24:24.211
Check it out.

24:31.852 --> 24:33.844
Real live fairy dust.

24:33.979 --> 24:36.387
Yeah. Turns grown men into criminals.

24:36.523 --> 24:38.065
What's the composition?

24:38.191 --> 24:39.057
Si-

24:39.192 --> 24:40.651
O2.

24:40.777 --> 24:42.236
Silica dust.

24:42.362 --> 24:44.236
Each particle's 100 times smaller

24:44.364 --> 24:46.487
than a grain of sand.

24:46.617 --> 24:48.526
I thought you guys were processing the car.

24:48.660 --> 24:51.614
Yeah. Um, what do you know about silica?

24:51.747 --> 24:54.748
It's used to make glass.
It's mined in open pits. Why?

24:54.875 --> 24:58.742
Silica found both on Adam Brower's
clothing and the getaway vehicle.

24:58.879 --> 25:02.295
There's an abandoned silica mine
outside CalNevAri.

25:02.424 --> 25:03.966
What don't you know?

25:05.385 --> 25:06.963
(Sirens)

25:46.260 --> 25:47.125
Come here.

25:52.266 --> 25:53.428
The motorcycle tracks

25:53.558 --> 25:55.136
at the vehicle dump site

26:09.283 --> 26:11.275
Eurgh. That smells nice.

26:12.786 --> 26:16.285
It shouldn't smell at all
if this place is abandoned.

26:22.838 --> 26:24.415
Get your guns out.

26:40.314 --> 26:42.306
(Sighs) Say hello to Darin Hanson.

26:49.823 --> 26:51.816
Shot with a.45.

26:53.327 --> 26:54.572
Execution style.

26:54.703 --> 26:56.197
Adam Tammy

26:56.330 --> 26:58.737
And now Darin. All dead.

26:58.874 --> 27:01.329
And we're out of suspects.

27:03.170 --> 27:04.961
Three robbers hold up the casino

27:05.088 --> 27:06.286
Tammy was in black

27:06.423 --> 27:08.083
Adam was the one in blue

27:09.217 --> 27:10.416
And that leaves us Darin.

27:10.552 --> 27:14.420
We found Darin and Tammy's prints
at the convenience store.

27:14.556 --> 27:16.881
Hours before the heist, the clerk gets murdered.

27:18.936 --> 27:22.684
Shot with the same gun
used to kill Adam at the casino.

27:22.814 --> 27:27.642
The surveillance video tells us that Darin
was the only one in position to shoot Adam.

27:29.571 --> 27:30.982
Why did Darin kill Adam?

27:31.114 --> 27:32.692
Greed

27:32.824 --> 27:34.532
Fewer slices. Bigger pieces.

27:34.660 --> 27:37.447
Which explains why he killed Tammy.

27:40.248 --> 27:44.495
- That's confirmed?
- Epithelials on her neck match Darin's DNA.

27:44.628 --> 27:48.542
- Darin thought he was getting the whole score.
But now he's dead

27:48.674 --> 27:50.832
So, who killed him

27:50.968 --> 27:51.963
and where's the money?

27:52.094 --> 27:56.471
And we still don't know why Darin and Tammy
took out a convenience store clerk.

27:56.598 --> 28:00.762
Why kill a man for a few hundred bucks when
you're about to steal a few hundred thousand?

28:00.894 --> 28:02.721
We've got more questions than answers.

28:02.854 --> 28:07.315
I just got off the phone with the Laughlin CSI
assigned to last month's Cottage Casino case.

28:07.442 --> 28:12.354
He told me the casino's cameras
captured four assailants, not three.

28:12.489 --> 28:15.656
Maybe Tower Club surveillance
missed something.

28:15.784 --> 28:18.453
Actually, it didn't. We did.

28:18.537 --> 28:20.328
Tower Casino surveillance.

28:20.455 --> 28:24.749
On your left, the camera's trained
on where Tammy, Darin and Adam entered.

28:24.876 --> 28:29.788
The screen on your right
is trained on the gaming tables.

28:29.923 --> 28:30.954
OK. Check it out.

28:35.637 --> 28:39.386
- What are we looking for?
- What? You missed him?

28:41.184 --> 28:43.557
I'll play it again, slower, just for you.

28:44.855 --> 28:48.354
Now, keep your eye trained
on the pit boss and the chandelier.

28:53.447 --> 28:56.697
- He ducked before the chandelier fell.
- Before Tammy drew her gun.

28:56.825 --> 28:57.940
Play it again.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.831
Well done Warrick

29:04.958 --> 29:06.666
You've found our mole.

29:07.794 --> 29:09.787
The pit boss's name is Max Duncan.

29:09.921 --> 29:13.373
He started working there
about three weeks ago, and before that...

29:13.508 --> 29:16.509
Let me guess. Laughlin? Cottage Casino?

29:18.138 --> 29:20.807
I'll call Brass. He can make the arrest.

29:20.933 --> 29:24.136
I'll meet him at the station.
I'll call you with an update.

29:40.243 --> 29:41.951
Max Duncan?

29:42.079 --> 29:43.822
Yeah. What the hell's going on here?

29:43.956 --> 29:45.663
You going somewhere?

29:45.791 --> 29:47.783
- Why?
I'll tell you now this works

29:47.918 --> 29:50.670
I ask the questions.
You give the answers. Downtown.

29:50.796 --> 29:52.504
I'm calling my lawyer.

29:54.132 --> 29:55.377
Good idea.

29:57.928 --> 29:59.470
Max...

29:59.596 --> 30:01.388
are you clairvoyant?

30:01.515 --> 30:02.760
Excuse me?

30:02.891 --> 30:05.263
The surveillance tape at the Tower Club Casino

30:05.394 --> 30:08.644
You ducked before there was a reason to cover.

30:08.772 --> 30:10.231
I saw a gun.

30:10.357 --> 30:11.899
I hit the ground.

30:12.025 --> 30:14.018
OK. Let's try this.

30:14.152 --> 30:15.944
Why were you leaving town?

30:17.072 --> 30:20.322
- Trying to beat a murder rap?
- I didn't kill anyone.

30:20.450 --> 30:22.823
You forget about Darin Hanson?

30:22.953 --> 30:24.613
Your car was covered

30:24.746 --> 30:26.739
with grey dust. Silica.

30:27.958 --> 30:29.950
It places you at the murder scene.

30:30.085 --> 30:32.956
- Well, I didn't kill him. I went there, but...
Max

30:33.088 --> 30:36.291
- I'm advising you not to say another word.
- No, I want to clear this up.

30:36.425 --> 30:40.043
Right, I went out to the mine,
but I didn't kill Darin.

30:40.178 --> 30:41.174
He was already dead.

30:43.056 --> 30:44.764
All right. Look, I...

30:45.892 --> 30:47.470
I'll admit...

30:47.603 --> 30:49.310
I helped him out.

30:49.438 --> 30:52.189
I... I told him when and where to hit.

30:52.316 --> 30:54.225
That's why I ducked.

30:54.359 --> 30:55.438
But that's it.

30:55.569 --> 30:57.028
That's a lot.

30:57.154 --> 31:00.938
And it still doesn't explain
why you went to see Darin.

31:01.074 --> 31:04.028
- Max, that is enough.
- Well, I went to collect my share.

31:05.162 --> 31:08.163
But the money was gone,
Darin was dead and I panicked.

31:08.290 --> 31:10.329
But I didn't shoot him.

31:10.459 --> 31:12.950
You can't get me for murder on this.

31:13.086 --> 31:18.044
When someone is killed during a commission
of a felony, all the conspirators are liable.

31:18.175 --> 31:22.219
Darin Hanson shot Adam Brower,
but you might as well have pulled the trigger.

31:25.891 --> 31:27.468
Let's make a deal.

31:27.601 --> 31:29.060
Tell me.

31:29.186 --> 31:31.511
Who else was involved? Who killed Darin?

31:31.647 --> 31:34.482
Look, Darin was the only one that I spoke to.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.441
I never even met the other three.

31:39.571 --> 31:41.445
Then we got no deal.

31:41.573 --> 31:43.365
Officer

31:44.493 --> 31:45.442
Let's go.

31:57.381 --> 31:59.373
You know what? I kinda believe him.

31:59.508 --> 32:01.002
Yeah, me too.

32:02.135 --> 32:04.342
He confirmed a fourth.

32:04.471 --> 32:05.420
Darin plus three.

32:05.555 --> 32:09.090
- Just like Laughlin.
- So, the last man standing killed Darin.

32:09.226 --> 32:10.934
And he's still out there,

32:11.061 --> 32:12.888
flushed with cash

32:13.021 --> 32:15.014
and a.45 calibre.

32:16.275 --> 32:18.563
Surveillance stills from the Laughlin heist.

32:18.694 --> 32:22.359
Four perps. We've identified three.
Darin, Tammy and Adam.

32:22.489 --> 32:25.158
- All deceased.
- Yeah. All murdered.

32:25.242 --> 32:26.784
And that leaves one

32:26.910 --> 32:31.157
ID the unknown, good chance
we solve both cases, Laughlin and Vegas.

32:31.290 --> 32:33.662
Except all we got is a guy in drag.

32:33.792 --> 32:36.164
Well, that's why I'm here.

32:36.295 --> 32:37.623
(Technician types)

32:37.754 --> 32:39.628
I've divided the photo into segments,

32:39.756 --> 32:42.426
removed the disguise
and rebuilt the original image

32:42.551 --> 32:44.294
based on male physiological norms.

32:44.428 --> 32:46.005
Now it's not exact

32:46.138 --> 32:48.593
but you'll have an idea what your guy looks like.

32:57.065 --> 32:58.643
That's Dustin Bale.

32:58.775 --> 33:01.942
- The clerk from the convenience store?
- Whoa, hold on.

33:02.070 --> 33:04.988
He was killed
hours before the Tower Club heist.

33:05.115 --> 33:07.404
In on Laughlin. Out on Vegas.

33:07.534 --> 33:10.025
So Darin took him out first

33:10.162 --> 33:13.163
He cleared the register
just to make it look like a robbery.

33:13.290 --> 33:15.995
But the pit boss said it was Darin plus three.

33:16.126 --> 33:18.913
Because he knew there were four
at the Laughlin heist.

33:19.046 --> 33:21.287
Maybe he didn't know that the clerk wasn't there.

33:21.423 --> 33:24.210
He wasn't counting wigs. He was hiding

33:24.343 --> 33:26.300
under a blackjack table.

33:26.428 --> 33:28.421
And we're back to "Who killed Darin Hanson?"

33:30.807 --> 33:32.385
- Bobby D.
- Yean?

33:32.517 --> 33:34.095
I need your help.

33:35.604 --> 33:37.810
Another round from the casino heist?

33:37.940 --> 33:39.315
Indirectly, yeah.

33:42.986 --> 33:45.477
Well, the tip didn't blossom.

33:45.614 --> 33:48.152
Not a hollow point,
so it's not from Darin Hanson's gun.

33:48.283 --> 33:49.861
No, it's from his head.

33:51.745 --> 33:53.738
All right 230 grains

33:53.872 --> 33:56.908
gives us a.45 automatic.

33:57.042 --> 33:57.991
What else?

33:58.126 --> 33:59.289
OK.

33:59.419 --> 34:02.420
Normally, lands and grooves
are highly delineated.

34:02.547 --> 34:05.383
These are smooth polished

34:05.509 --> 34:08.759
which means that your projectile
was fired from a polygonal barrel.

34:08.887 --> 34:10.465
Be right back.

34:16.395 --> 34:19.893
OK. These are the only types of.45 automatics
with polygonal barrels.

34:20.023 --> 34:21.351
The gun that fired your bullet

34:21.483 --> 34:25.896
was either a Heckler & Koch USP or a Glock.

34:30.033 --> 34:32.359
Narrow it further.

34:33.578 --> 34:36.366
Well, that's what I'm doing.
Dissecting your bullet.

34:36.498 --> 34:38.786
Hey Nick
- Mm-nm?

34:38.917 --> 34:40.542
Count the stripes.

34:41.670 --> 34:43.248
One, two, three, four,

34:43.380 --> 34:45.289
five six

34:45.424 --> 34:48.425
- Six lands and grooves with a right-hand twist.
- Mm-hm.

34:48.552 --> 34:51.885
A Glock's got eight, Heckler & Koch, six.

34:52.014 --> 34:52.962
You got your gun.

34:53.098 --> 34:54.889
Let's run ATF.

34:57.143 --> 34:59.849
A pretty unique weapon. Expensive.

34:59.980 --> 35:02.685
Not exactly what you'd buy
out of the back of a van.

35:03.817 --> 35:05.810
(Computer beeps)

35:07.613 --> 35:09.404
Only take a second.

35:09.531 --> 35:11.524
(Beeping)
- See? Can I call it?

35:13.702 --> 35:15.695
Only 18 registered in-state.

35:15.829 --> 35:17.905
Ten in Clark County.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.617
Seven of them still in circulation.

35:24.087 --> 35:26.625
- Any names jumping off the page?
- Just one

35:26.757 --> 35:28.630
It's out of left field.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.633
About T5 miles out.

35:40.479 --> 35:42.471
You're accusing me of murder?

35:42.606 --> 35:45.179
And absconding with a quarter of a mil
of stolen money.

35:45.317 --> 35:46.728
Where'd you stash the cash?

35:46.860 --> 35:49.066
- I'm a state trooper.
- How does a cop

35:49.196 --> 35:51.651
hook up with an ex-con like Darin?

35:51.782 --> 35:53.490
I can answer that.

35:53.617 --> 35:55.241
It's all in a day's work.

36:04.503 --> 36:06.080
A potato silencer

36:06.213 --> 36:08.455
muffles a bullet, but won't silence it.

36:08.590 --> 36:10.499
You went in,

36:10.634 --> 36:11.713
your gun drawn.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.962
Take it easy, pal.

36:16.098 --> 36:18.007
You should have arrested them.

36:18.141 --> 36:20.300
But something happened, didn't it?

36:20.435 --> 36:21.598
My bet?

36:21.728 --> 36:23.057
Tammy made you an offer.

36:23.188 --> 36:24.517
Drop the weapon.

36:24.648 --> 36:26.190
Hey, uh...

36:26.316 --> 36:28.108
Let's be smart about this.

36:29.653 --> 36:32.358
You can take us in or we can cut you in.

36:36.994 --> 36:39.911
They still had pockets full of cash
from the Laughlin job.

36:40.038 --> 36:42.790
They offered you a finder's fee.

36:44.459 --> 36:45.918
This isn't gonna do it.

36:46.044 --> 36:48.582
It'll hold you over... till tomorrow.

36:50.674 --> 36:52.002
Deal?

37:03.103 --> 37:05.226
What are you doing?

37:08.734 --> 37:11.900
You patrol 975 square miles

37:12.029 --> 37:15.065
Is the CalNevAri mine part of your jurisdiction?

37:15.198 --> 37:18.567
- No, I'm east of the mine.
- But you've been there, haven't you?

37:37.512 --> 37:39.719
Where's the cash?

37:39.848 --> 37:41.971
Jim, hit the overhead, will you?

37:46.188 --> 37:48.264
Silica is a crystal

37:48.398 --> 37:51.068
It reflects the light Even trace amounts

37:51.151 --> 37:52.729
will snow up

37:55.072 --> 37:56.649
How about that?

39:15.527 --> 39:17.520
More than I'd make in a lifetime.

39:17.654 --> 39:19.398
Was it worth it?

39:19.531 --> 39:22.318
You wouldn't understand.

39:22.451 --> 39:23.909
That's right

39:24.036 --> 39:26.990
- We make the big buck s.
- Look

39:27.122 --> 39:28.865
I was never that guy.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.039
You know, that guy that wins the jackpots,

39:32.169 --> 39:34.457
gets promoted catches the breaks?

39:34.588 --> 39:36.248
It was right there.

39:37.382 --> 39:39.589
You're still not that guy. Get him out of here.

39:48.477 --> 39:51.146
$250,000 turned a career cop bad.

39:51.271 --> 39:53.015
Yeah, well, he had his price.

39:55.943 --> 39:57.141
We all do.
