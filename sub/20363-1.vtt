Brother

18:12.001 --> 18:13.792
Go hide the clothes in a few days

18:15.126 --> 18:18.626
Brother, we have guns that we've no use for

18:18.709 --> 18:19.751
and clothes that we can't wear

18:19.834 --> 18:21.167
So why do we keep them?

18:21.501 --> 18:22.501
For a big fire?

18:22.584 --> 18:24.126
If it wasn't for Brother,

18:24.209 --> 18:25.334
you'd be in the hands of the Japanese

18:25.417 --> 18:28.584
And you? If you'd aimed better
with that crate...

18:28.667 --> 18:29.584

When can we do something really big?

18:38.001 --> 18:38.834
Talk less!

18:39.167 --> 18:41.251
Brother, you don't even smoke

18:41.334 --> 18:43.126
Why do you always carry that pipe?

18:45.542 --> 18:46.709
No reason

18:47.459 --> 18:51.209
How do I draw the tiger?
I couldn't get it right

19:02.917 --> 19:03.917
What is that?

19:04.542 --> 19:05.792
(Japanese) Where the heck are they?!

19:05.876 --> 19:07.917
The Captain wants to know where they are!

19:24.084 --> 19:26.584

will happen today

- Okay

20:05.417 --> 20:07.084

20:23.376 --> 20:24.292
I'm home, Mom

20:28.626 --> 20:29.917
The pancake smells great!

20:32.876 --> 20:34.084
Dahai, help me out!

20:35.501 --> 20:37.751
- I'm bleeding again
- What's wrong?!

20:37.751 --> 20:39.167
Come sit down!

20:39.251 --> 20:41.959
What's wrong with the donkey?

20:42.417 --> 20:45.792
It kicked me. So I drugged it,

20:45.876 --> 20:46.917
It calms down a little

20:47.001 --> 20:50.751
Such bad luck today!
Daytime, beaten by the Japanese

20:50.834 --> 20:52.167
I was beaten by Japanese too

20:52.292 --> 20:53.959
Were you kicked by a donkey at night?

20:54.042 --> 20:55.084
Well, no...

20:55.167 --> 20:56.542
How unlucky I am!

20:56.542 --> 20:58.042
You are pretty unlucky

20:58.126 --> 20:59.042
Have some pancakes

21:02.001 --> 21:04.959
I thought you were all just messing around

21:05.042 --> 21:06.709
But now you've stirred up such big trouble

21:06.792 --> 21:09.792
It's nothing big, Mom. Right, brother?

21:09.876 --> 21:11.751
I want to join small missions too, Dad!

21:12.584 --> 21:13.917
This isn't right

21:14.001 --> 21:16.917
Dahai, you call me Brother and call her Mom

21:17.667 --> 21:19.626
What if I marry her

21:19.709 --> 21:21.292
Then will you call me Brother, or Dad?

21:21.376 --> 21:22.417
Come on

21:22.501 --> 21:23.376
Xing'er, what about you?

21:23.876 --> 21:25.209
Will you still call me Dad or...

21:25.542 --> 21:27.209
What are you blabbering on about...

21:27.292 --> 21:30.251
- Serious question!
- You always tell people to talk less,

21:30.251 --> 21:31.709
but you talk the most

21:31.792 --> 21:33.792
Maybe, I'll drug you too one day

21:35.126 --> 21:38.334
Just put some in the pancakes.
The more, the better

21:39.001 --> 21:40.167
You think I won't do it?

21:40.834 --> 21:44.334
You should mark the drugged one,
so you don't eat it

21:45.542 --> 21:46.917
You really think I won't do it?

22:15.126 --> 22:17.709

(Japanese) You again

23:28.334 --> 23:29.417
Why are you here?

23:30.751 --> 23:32.251
Someone went over the wall!

23:34.709 --> 23:38.376
You see, I'm a widow

23:38.376 --> 23:41.959
It would create gossip if he was seen here

23:44.042 --> 23:45.251
So he had to sneak in

23:45.917 --> 23:46.626
Sneak in?

23:47.459 --> 23:49.584
That's right, he snuck in over the wall

24:09.417 --> 24:11.459
You've forgotten? You

24:13.084 --> 24:16.792
You. This morning. Hit me

24:17.167 --> 24:18.251
Blood. Pain

24:21.209 --> 24:22.251
So you're a sneaker

24:22.834 --> 24:24.917
Right, a sneaker

24:56.167 --> 24:57.167
(Japanese) Captain

24:57.251 --> 24:59.084
(Japanese) We've found someone suspicious

25:09.042 --> 25:11.876
No wonder we're always
losing things in the cellar

25:11.959 --> 25:12.959
- You're stealing from me!
- (Japanese) Get him out of here!

25:13.042 --> 25:14.209
I'm only borrowing!

25:15.417 --> 25:16.626
(Japanese) Hicks!

25:19.834 --> 25:21.042
(Japanese) Next house!

25:25.042 --> 25:25.709
He's on fire!

25:27.667 --> 25:28.959
- Get water!
- What do we do?

25:29.042 --> 25:30.834
Are you okay? Say something!

25:30.834 --> 25:31.834
Hurry!

25:32.417 --> 25:34.126
I'm okay! The fire's out!

26:11.376 --> 26:14.584
Everyone else was killed by the Japanese

26:15.417 --> 26:17.917
They all died but he alone survived?

26:18.834 --> 26:20.417
Is he a deserter?

26:21.001 --> 26:21.751
I doubt it

26:21.834 --> 26:23.292
Where have you hidden him?

26:24.084 --> 26:26.209
At Auntie Qin's. They're taking care of him

26:26.292 --> 26:27.834
We'll move him to the cave later

26:32.376 --> 26:33.834
Fan Chuan. Here late

26:34.667 --> 26:37.542
"FAN CHUAN - NOODLE SHOP OWNER"

26:37.792 --> 26:39.584
Where have you been having fun?

26:41.542 --> 26:42.834
- Kid...
- Yes, Boss

26:42.917 --> 26:44.209
Go feed the horse

26:44.292 --> 26:45.042
Sure

26:45.126 --> 26:46.167
- Make sure it eats its fill
- Alright

26:46.251 --> 26:47.376
That's a nice jacket

26:53.376 --> 26:56.209
I hate that.
Try giving attitude to the Japanese!

26:56.751 --> 26:57.667
He really did fight the Japanese

26:58.126 --> 26:59.876
I hear he's a sharpshooter

27:00.834 --> 27:04.001
Whatever. Why did they want
to blow up the bridge?

27:04.084 --> 27:05.376
He didn't tell me

27:05.459 --> 27:06.417
I don't get it

27:06.626 --> 27:09.042
They sacrificed all those men
to blow up our bridge?

27:09.251 --> 27:12.042
The Japanese are there,
so it's their bridge. Get it?

27:12.126 --> 27:14.459
How dare they! That's our home turf!

27:16.501 --> 27:18.876
Take it outside.
Stop screaming about the Japanese here

27:18.959 --> 27:19.751
What'd you mean?

27:19.834 --> 27:22.876
You heard me. All you guys do is talk

27:22.959 --> 27:25.042
That won't accomplish a thing!

27:25.126 --> 27:26.459
How do you know we haven't?

27:27.042 --> 27:27.584
Shoot!

27:27.667 --> 27:29.167
Exactly, today we...

27:29.584 --> 27:31.251
That's all you guys can do

27:31.417 --> 27:34.626
At least we're not cowards like you, Fan Chuan

27:35.667 --> 27:36.501
What'd you say?

27:38.626 --> 27:41.209
Actually Fan Chuan is right. Bill please!

27:56.126 --> 27:57.376
Zhu, let's go

28:22.584 --> 28:26.251
Have you heard?
Fan Chuan was a warlord's bodyguard

28:28.334 --> 28:30.792
Ma Yuan! Get down here

28:35.126 --> 28:36.084
What's up?

28:36.167 --> 28:39.251
Listen, stop causing trouble for me, okay?

28:40.834 --> 28:42.709
Just one more job. We're done

28:43.917 --> 28:47.209
Don't push me.
I don't want to be forced to rat you out

29:02.626 --> 29:05.292
"YUKO - INSPECTOR,
JAPANESE MILITARY POLICE"

29:07.167 --> 29:08.209
(Japanese) Welcome madam

29:08.709 --> 29:09.792
(Japanese) What?

29:14.751 --> 29:16.501
(Japanese) Banzai!

29:16.584 --> 29:18.126
Bonfire?

29:18.209 --> 29:21.667
(Japanese) Banzai!

29:21.792 --> 29:22.501
What're they saying?

29:23.209 --> 29:24.167
It's Japanese!

29:26.709 --> 29:27.834
Long life!

29:30.334 --> 29:31.542
(Japanese) Banzai!

29:31.917 --> 29:33.167
Why're there so many soldiers?

29:33.917 --> 29:35.584
They must be reinforcements for the bridge

29:47.751 --> 29:49.876
I'm feeling much better. Can I leave now?

29:50.167 --> 29:52.959
This injury will take
at least ten more days to heal

29:53.042 --> 29:56.459
Ten days?! If I don't blow
the bridge in four days...

29:57.917 --> 29:59.251
Then what?

30:00.126 --> 30:01.459
You wouldn't understand

30:03.334 --> 30:07.251
Just pretend we've never met.
And let me go okay?

30:32.001 --> 30:35.626
I don't want to fight anymore. I miss home

30:36.292 --> 30:38.376
I miss mom!

30:40.209 --> 30:41.584
I miss mom!

30:42.001 --> 30:44.251
Fine! I just can't stand crying

30:47.334 --> 30:50.167
I miss my mom, too

30:50.792 --> 30:52.792
She was also killed by the Japanese

30:52.876 --> 30:55.959
I didn't even get to see her one last time

30:56.834 --> 30:59.501
Alright. Stop crying

30:59.584 --> 31:01.459
I can't stop you. Just leave

31:01.959 --> 31:03.001
How do I leave?

31:03.084 --> 31:04.292
How would he leave?

31:05.834 --> 31:06.792
By train

31:18.792 --> 31:19.751
The train is here!

31:21.084 --> 31:22.376
- Get ready!
- Shoot!

31:29.917 --> 31:30.917
Don't be scared

31:33.542 --> 31:34.501
Lower us!

31:56.959 --> 31:59.126
Thanks. You guys can go

31:59.376 --> 32:00.459
Dahai, you go first

32:00.542 --> 32:01.167
Go ahead

32:03.084 --> 32:05.084
It is going to snow...Let me send you off

32:06.042 --> 32:11.209
It's not easy to be a soldier.
When you get home...

32:11.292 --> 32:15.417
Brother, I was lying
when I said I was going home

32:16.334 --> 32:17.792
I'm actually going back

32:17.876 --> 32:19.792
That bridge, must be blown up

32:20.334 --> 32:23.292
Tell me, why do you have to blow the bridge?

32:23.834 --> 32:26.917
It's for the war effort.
You wouldn't understand

32:27.376 --> 32:30.626
People like you don't do big things, right?

32:31.334 --> 32:34.917
Fine. Your leg injury isn't that bad

32:35.459 --> 32:36.584
Get off the train when it stops

32:36.667 --> 32:38.751
It's stopping

32:52.167 --> 32:53.459
The Japanese are inspecting the train. Run!

32:53.542 --> 32:55.292
I told you to leave! Now we're both stuck!

32:55.376 --> 32:58.042
Don't worry,
there are plenty of places to hide. Hurry!

32:58.126 --> 32:59.167
They're here for me

33:00.667 --> 33:01.376
I'll deal with them

33:02.626 --> 33:03.917
Leave! It's an order!

33:09.417 --> 33:10.376
- One more favor!
- Go ahead!

33:10.459 --> 33:11.251
(Japanese) Search thoroughly!

33:13.501 --> 33:15.459
If I don't make it, find my platoon

33:15.751 --> 33:17.334
Tell them that I failed

33:17.417 --> 33:18.417
And tell them to blow the bridge in three days

33:19.792 --> 33:22.709
Also, I'm not a deserter

33:24.917 --> 33:26.834
Of course not. Where's your platoon?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.417
(Japanese) Search up there!

33:29.626 --> 33:30.667
Hurry. There's no time

33:53.417 --> 33:54.251
Remember what I said

33:55.834 --> 33:58.626
The bridge must be destroyed

34:13.458 --> 34:14.792
What's up? Brother?

34:22.667 --> 34:23.833
Come and see!

34:24.417 --> 34:26.458
Off on another big mission, Brother?

34:30.042 --> 34:32.876
"ERPANG - BLACKSMITH"

34:38.792 --> 34:40.167
Dad, that soldier from the Eighth...

34:40.876 --> 34:42.876
He should be home now, right?

34:43.542 --> 34:44.792
What do we do now?

34:45.376 --> 34:47.126
Yeah. Tell us something

34:47.917 --> 34:49.126
I'm skipping work today

34:49.376 --> 34:50.708
I'm going to your mother's grave

35:10.084 --> 35:11.709
(Japanese) Don't worry

35:14.084 --> 35:16.584
(Japanese) Although we have reinforcements

35:16.917 --> 35:18.251
(Japanese) We should remain cautious

35:18.417 --> 35:21.417
(Japanese) Even the Eighth
couldn't blow up the bridge

35:23.334 --> 35:24.334
(Japanese) So...

35:25.584 --> 35:27.834
(Japanese) Who else can can do it?

35:30.667 --> 35:32.542
You keep saying that I won't do anything big

35:34.126 --> 35:36.376
I'll show them what I can do in a few days

35:38.834 --> 35:41.042
Maybe, I'll finally avenge you

35:44.751 --> 35:45.751
Really

36:04.626 --> 36:05.709
What are you doing?

36:05.792 --> 36:06.501
What are you doing?

36:06.792 --> 36:09.376
We're doing whatever you're doing, Brother

36:09.792 --> 36:10.626
- Shoot!
- Dad,

36:10.709 --> 36:11.584
- I know...
- Talk less!

36:11.667 --> 36:14.001
Don't tell me that
you're going to blow up that bridge

36:16.626 --> 36:18.542
You're right. I am going to blow it up

36:19.251 --> 36:20.917
See? I told you so

36:21.001 --> 36:21.917
We're going to do something big!

36:22.001 --> 36:23.334
Let's do it then!

36:23.417 --> 36:25.626
An entire Eighth Route Army couldn't do it

36:25.709 --> 36:27.042
Can people like us do it?

36:27.126 --> 36:29.834
Him? Him? And Me? How can we?!

36:29.917 --> 36:31.584
Did I say that you're doing it with me?

36:31.876 --> 36:33.334
We're a team!

36:33.417 --> 36:35.959
We do everything as one!

36:36.042 --> 36:37.834
- We eat together, we...
- Quiet!

36:38.501 --> 36:39.876
I was going to ask you guys

36:40.167 --> 36:42.417
I can't get to the Eighth

36:43.542 --> 36:44.876
So we have to do this for him

36:44.959 --> 36:46.959
That's great! Let's do it!

36:47.042 --> 36:49.584
Hold on! Know how much explosives do we need?

36:49.667 --> 36:50.834
I know where we can find some

36:50.917 --> 36:53.834
In the armory at Shagou Station

36:53.834 --> 36:56.876
Station Master Huang mumbled
while I was fitting him

36:57.042 --> 36:58.917
He said there's a load of explosive packs

36:58.917 --> 37:00.084
We'll do it tomorrow!

37:00.501 --> 37:01.209
Shoot!

37:01.292 --> 37:03.584
How do we blow a bridge with explosives?

37:03.667 --> 37:07.042
Easy. We just throw them at the bridge

37:07.126 --> 37:09.667
Duang! Duang! It explodes!

37:11.126 --> 37:12.001
Duang?

37:15.251 --> 37:17.959
"GETTING EXPLOSIVES"

37:18.042 --> 37:18.876
Fan Chuan

37:18.959 --> 37:19.709
Here. Noodles up!

37:19.792 --> 37:21.792
I asked for an large bowl with extra meat

37:21.876 --> 37:22.959
Can you afford it?

37:24.292 --> 37:25.709
I got it from the Japanese

37:26.751 --> 37:27.959
Fan Chuan

37:28.042 --> 37:29.001
What's up?

37:29.084 --> 37:30.626
You've fought in the war right?

37:32.876 --> 37:35.459
How'd you detonate a Japanese explosive pack?

37:44.042 --> 37:45.209
- Just throw it
- Throw it!

37:45.292 --> 37:46.584
- Throw it
- Throw it!

37:47.042 --> 37:48.292
That will never work

37:49.084 --> 37:50.334
Oh. Then...

37:50.417 --> 37:52.001
Figure it out yourself

37:56.167 --> 37:59.834
Listen. We can't beat the Japanese

38:00.417 --> 38:02.792
I fought for a warlord.
That's pretty awesome, right?

38:03.001 --> 38:04.417
And we still lost

38:06.501 --> 38:07.834
With so few of you,

38:08.334 --> 38:09.792
don't even bother

38:12.834 --> 38:17.042
Count me in, Brother. I'm not a coward

38:21.126 --> 38:25.501
Dahai, I want to join your next big mission

38:32.126 --> 38:34.209
Something's bothering you inside

38:34.626 --> 38:35.751
You can't even hide it

38:38.084 --> 38:39.667
About us...

38:40.667 --> 38:41.959
when are we going to get hitched?

38:43.917 --> 38:46.126
Later. A little longer

38:57.126 --> 38:58.834
Hey, get out of here

39:04.292 --> 39:05.209
Hurry up

39:24.209 --> 39:25.334
He beats me

39:50.584 --> 39:51.376
Here!

40:06.917 --> 40:07.792
Go!

40:26.084 --> 40:27.334
Hey, there's a ladder here

41:17.376 --> 41:19.417
That's mine. I'm sending the ducks to you sir!

42:55.751 --> 42:57.792
(Japanese) Hey, what are you doing?

43:40.376 --> 43:41.542
What do we do?

43:42.501 --> 43:43.084
Go up

43:43.834 --> 43:44.626
How?

43:45.126 --> 43:46.751
Drop two packs

44:49.917 --> 44:51.042
Why do you drop so many?

44:51.126 --> 44:53.251
How are you going to go up if not?
There's one left

44:53.334 --> 44:54.209
Take it

45:12.251 --> 45:14.542
All that work, and you stole one pack?!

45:15.084 --> 45:15.834
You try it then!

45:16.334 --> 45:17.084
If I was there...

45:17.167 --> 45:19.042
- Forget it. You can't even climb up to the roof
- Talk less!

45:20.334 --> 45:21.584
(Japanese) Assembly! Go chase the train

45:22.501 --> 45:23.292
(Japanese) You, over there!

45:24.501 --> 45:26.751
(Japanese) You, over there!

45:53.501 --> 45:54.542
Go check it out

45:58.001 --> 45:59.001
So many Japanese!

45:59.084 --> 46:00.167
Don't worry. We're safe here

46:03.209 --> 46:03.834
Not safe

46:03.917 --> 46:05.251
Are they here for us?

46:08.959 --> 46:10.626
You take the pack. You three to the front

46:11.126 --> 46:11.917
Let's go

46:36.042 --> 46:37.834
I'll go first. You guys follow me

46:37.917 --> 46:38.459
Okay

46:43.917 --> 46:44.959
You. You go first!

46:50.376 --> 46:51.459
What do we do now?!

46:51.542 --> 46:52.876
How would I know?!

47:15.084 --> 47:15.751
The explosive!

47:21.501 --> 47:22.376
(Japanese) Hurry!

47:29.584 --> 47:31.084
Hey, there's flour here!

47:45.042 --> 47:45.834
Shoot!

47:49.626 --> 47:50.876
(Japanese) You idiot!

48:05.084 --> 48:06.209
Okay, we're done

48:32.834 --> 48:34.042
See how many you've left

48:57.876 --> 48:58.876
Be careful!

48:59.292 --> 49:00.542
- Thank you
- You are welcome

49:03.292 --> 49:04.167
Where are you going?

49:14.751 --> 49:15.459
Hey!

49:35.626 --> 49:37.834
How do you use the explosives?

49:37.917 --> 49:39.417
Just light it up

49:44.209 --> 49:45.167
Go, go, go!

49:45.251 --> 49:46.959
Hide, Dakui!

49:47.251 --> 49:50.417
Nice flour. I can make Brother
some buns tonight

50:08.501 --> 50:09.209
Put that down!

50:32.042 --> 50:32.792
Where is he?

50:33.167 --> 50:35.251
That's a really big explosion!

50:36.209 --> 50:37.292
That was close

50:37.751 --> 50:43.126
Soon, we'll be the rulers of this place

50:43.209 --> 50:44.167
What do you mean?

50:44.751 --> 50:47.501
The battle in China is growing

50:47.667 --> 50:50.501
In a few days, we'll, have an unending chain...

50:51.126 --> 50:55.042
of supplies to the front line

50:59.542 --> 51:01.126
(Japanese) Did something unusual happen today?

51:04.209 --> 51:05.334
(Japanese) Did anyone miss work today?

51:05.667 --> 51:06.959
Did anyone miss work?

51:07.042 --> 51:08.417
No cargo truck today,

51:08.501 --> 51:10.084
- so there's not many people...
- (Japanese) Why are You smiling?

51:14.334 --> 51:15.459
(Japanese) I'm sorry

51:16.626 --> 51:20.167
(Japanese) Kameda, you're responsible
for the lost explosives

51:25.584 --> 51:26.209
(Japanese) What the heck is this?

51:27.042 --> 51:28.792
(Japanese) This is the only thing I could find

51:41.126 --> 51:42.126
(Japanese) Let's start

51:42.584 --> 51:44.459
(Japanese) This is going to hurt

51:44.542 --> 51:45.542
(Japanese) Don't be a coward!

51:59.709 --> 52:00.751
(Japanese) My hand!

52:01.167 --> 52:03.584
(Japanese) It hurts!

52:04.084 --> 52:04.709
(Japanese) Imbecile!

52:06.834 --> 52:08.709
We can't blow up the bridge!

52:08.792 --> 52:10.167
Why not?

52:10.251 --> 52:12.417
It's rare we get to do something so big

52:13.167 --> 52:14.001
Don't you want revenge?

52:14.084 --> 52:15.459
Of course I want revenge

52:15.626 --> 52:17.376
But blowing up the bridge isn't revenge

52:17.459 --> 52:20.084
- Yes it is revenge!
- Stop!

52:20.709 --> 52:22.917
First, they know their explosives
have been stolen

52:23.001 --> 52:25.126
They're out for blood, so we must be careful

52:25.751 --> 52:27.667
Second, if they know...

52:27.751 --> 52:29.542
the explosives were for blowing the bridge

52:30.001 --> 52:32.084
It'll make it more difficult. Third...

52:32.167 --> 52:33.334
So what?

52:33.584 --> 52:35.792
We just let Daguo
and the soldiers die in vain?!

52:35.876 --> 52:37.126
In vain?!

52:40.584 --> 52:41.667
What's the third thing?

52:41.751 --> 52:42.417
What?

52:42.584 --> 52:43.334
The third thing!

52:43.959 --> 52:44.876
Forgot

52:45.209 --> 52:46.376
Come here!

52:46.459 --> 52:47.626
What's going on?

52:58.126 --> 53:00.501
Erpang's butcher knife!

53:02.376 --> 53:05.751
Knives, rods, chains. All solid

53:06.417 --> 53:08.167
Come take a look at this!

53:10.376 --> 53:11.542
I'll kick! Go!

53:18.167 --> 53:19.167
Come on!

53:20.209 --> 53:21.209
Go Away!

53:26.084 --> 53:27.376
- It's okay
- Get off me!

53:28.626 --> 53:31.334
They are not local!

53:32.542 --> 53:33.251
Are you okay?

53:36.542 --> 53:37.417
I'll kill you with spice!

53:40.126 --> 53:41.084
Go!

53:44.917 --> 53:46.334
So many Japanese soldiers

53:51.792 --> 53:53.501
Brother, run!

54:13.209 --> 54:15.292
Stop. Don't move!

54:18.459 --> 54:19.042
(Japanese) Keep searching!

54:45.834 --> 54:47.667
- (Japanese) We've found him!
- (Japanese) That's him!

54:48.376 --> 54:49.167
(Japanese) Arrest them

54:56.209 --> 54:57.959
That looks painful. What'll we do?

54:58.459 --> 54:59.959
Can we get through this without any pain?

55:00.292 --> 55:01.334
I wish

55:01.959 --> 55:03.001
Let's give it try

55:07.001 --> 55:08.709
(Japanese) You two look alike

55:08.792 --> 55:10.959
He says you two look quite alike

55:12.376 --> 55:13.126
Alike?!

55:13.584 --> 55:16.542
- (Japanese) What I want to know is...
- Alike? I'm much more handsome

55:16.709 --> 55:18.084
You're more handsome?

55:18.167 --> 55:20.709
I was more handsome than you
when I was your age

55:20.959 --> 55:22.292
Did you see me when I was young?

55:22.376 --> 55:23.959
Of course not

55:24.042 --> 55:26.417
- How is that possible?
- Wasn't that decades ago?

55:26.417 --> 55:27.709
I wiped your butt when you were little!

55:27.792 --> 55:28.626
What do you think?

55:28.709 --> 55:30.001
Look at his nose!

55:30.084 --> 55:31.834
- What's wrong with my nose?
- It's too big!

55:32.459 --> 55:34.167
What's wrong with a big nose?
Your's is too small!

55:34.167 --> 55:35.542
A big nostril collects dirt easily

55:35.626 --> 55:37.876
- Tiny nose can hardly breathe
- Shut up!

55:37.959 --> 55:38.751
(Japanese) What'd they say?

55:40.251 --> 55:41.459
(Japanese) Noses...

55:42.042 --> 55:42.792
(Japanese) Noses?!

55:43.667 --> 55:45.751
Stop rambling!

55:48.709 --> 55:49.542
I don't understand

55:49.751 --> 55:51.751
Get a Chinese, Captain

55:51.834 --> 55:52.792
We don't understand him

55:53.376 --> 55:55.001
We...Don't...Understand...

55:55.084 --> 55:57.459
(Japanese) What are they saying?

55:57.542 --> 55:59.001
They got themselves in trouble

55:59.959 --> 56:02.001
My dad says you're an amazing sharpshooter

56:02.251 --> 56:03.459
Please help him

56:05.376 --> 56:06.501
I'm not a sharpshooter

56:08.459 --> 56:09.709
Look at these!

56:10.751 --> 56:12.292
Do they look like they can shoot?

56:12.542 --> 56:13.126
They do

56:15.376 --> 56:17.876
If I was a sharpshooter, then why am I here?

56:18.167 --> 56:19.501
I'd be doing big things

56:19.584 --> 56:21.459
The Tigers are doing big things!

56:23.167 --> 56:25.292
Well, I have my little business to take care of

56:25.584 --> 56:26.709
Get someone else

56:27.584 --> 56:28.459
Go! Go!

56:31.292 --> 56:32.959
What if they won't talk?

56:37.459 --> 56:38.417
Chinese?

56:38.709 --> 56:39.459
Hi...

56:39.542 --> 56:40.584
Speak Chinese

56:41.251 --> 56:43.209
We have a saying...

56:43.292 --> 56:44.667
A wise man doesn't join a hopeless fight

56:46.042 --> 56:47.667
Exactly! Since you know what I mean...

56:47.751 --> 56:48.417
Talk less!

56:49.167 --> 56:50.751
You don't want to get beaten, right?

56:50.834 --> 56:52.667
- Of course not
- Good to know. So...

56:55.042 --> 56:55.959
Hey, tell them...

56:58.251 --> 57:00.209
That's all I can do to help you

57:06.042 --> 57:08.626
Well...they've revealed everything

57:09.084 --> 57:10.667
(Japanese) They admit that...

57:11.209 --> 57:13.667
they stole the explosives

57:14.084 --> 57:15.584
(Japanese) They admit to
stealing the explosives

57:18.626 --> 57:19.417
(Japanese) Why?

57:19.501 --> 57:20.251
Why

57:20.334 --> 57:23.917
To fry fish! Frying fish with explosives!

57:24.959 --> 57:26.167
(Japanese) They fry fish with explosives

57:26.251 --> 57:27.042
(Japanese) Why?

57:27.251 --> 57:27.876
Why

57:27.959 --> 57:31.084
To make them more crispy and delicious

57:31.167 --> 57:35.126
There's a saying...
every movement needs a pioneer

57:35.209 --> 57:37.334
Different lands have different customs

57:37.417 --> 57:40.001
You'd be lost everywhere
if you didn't go anywhere

57:41.959 --> 57:43.417
(Japanese) Translate!

57:45.334 --> 57:47.251
(Japanese) I'm sorry

57:50.417 --> 57:51.126
(Japanese) I'm so sorry

57:51.542 --> 57:53.792
It's not my fault that you don't get it.
Why hit me?

57:56.751 --> 57:57.334
Shoot!

57:57.417 --> 57:58.417
You keep saying "shoot" all day

57:58.501 --> 58:00.292
but why didn't you do any reconnaissance?

58:00.542 --> 58:02.834
Stop arguing!

58:03.584 --> 58:05.876
Arguing doesn't solve a thing!

58:06.751 --> 58:08.834
I'll ask Auntie Qin for a solution

58:10.501 --> 58:16.084
(Japanese) They're lying.
Let's have some fun with them

58:16.417 --> 58:18.001
(Japanese) What do you mean?

58:18.542 --> 58:21.834
(Japanese) These hicks all have simple minds

58:21.917 --> 58:25.084
(Japanese) They will definitely
attempt a rescue

58:25.584 --> 58:27.792
(Japanese) We have our soldiers everywhere!

58:28.292 --> 58:29.709
(Japanese) They wouldn't dare to

58:31.501 --> 58:34.042
(Japanese) I'll bring a few soldiers with me,

58:34.126 --> 58:37.792
(Japanese) and wipe them all out tomorrow

58:39.584 --> 58:40.876
(Japanese) Don't underestimate them

58:43.542 --> 58:45.167
(Japanese) No one can defeat me

58:46.584 --> 58:47.751
(Japanese) Certainly not hicks

58:47.917 --> 58:50.376
"THE GREAT RESCUE"

58:56.792 --> 58:58.584
Listen up

58:58.667 --> 59:02.542
These two stole from the Imperial Army

59:02.626 --> 59:06.292
In two hours, they'll be taken away by train...

59:06.376 --> 59:08.251
to face judgment at the next station!

59:09.001 --> 59:12.084
These two stole from the Imperial Army...

59:12.417 --> 59:13.126
What're they doing?

59:13.209 --> 59:14.251
In two hours,

59:14.334 --> 59:17.167
They want to see if anyone will rescue us,

59:17.584 --> 59:19.959
I hope our guys won't see us

59:23.376 --> 59:25.126
How do we stop them, Brother?

59:26.084 --> 59:27.917
We can't stop them

59:28.626 --> 59:29.917
Kite!

59:30.334 --> 59:31.334
Kite!

59:36.126 --> 59:36.917
What happened?

59:39.251 --> 59:40.834
You Tigers...

59:40.917 --> 59:43.751
You aren't going to give up
until you go too far

59:46.417 --> 59:47.542
Excuse me

59:48.001 --> 59:49.376
Wait!

59:51.376 --> 59:53.084
Sir! Captain!

59:53.167 --> 59:55.792
Please let me through.
I'm giving them some food!

59:57.084 --> 59:58.501
(Japanese) What did they say?

59:59.167 --> 01:00:02.834
(Japanese) They just want to give them food

01:00:04.751 --> 01:00:06.626
- (Japanese) Let her through
- (Japanese) Let her through!

01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:11.209
It's you. Sneaking around again?

01:00:12.167 --> 01:00:13.126
What is this?

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.126
Pancakes

01:00:19.876 --> 01:00:21.876
How dare you put our flag on them!

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:24.709
What flag? It's just a red dot

01:00:24.876 --> 01:00:26.084
That's our national flag!

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:28.251
It's just a red dot. It's auspicious!

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:29.667
The dot on your flag is bigger

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:30.709
(Japanese) What did she say?

01:00:30.792 --> 01:00:33.876
(Japanese) She says it's an auspicious pattern

01:00:40.334 --> 01:00:41.251
That's scallion

01:00:41.501 --> 01:00:43.126
I love your pancakes

01:00:43.209 --> 01:00:44.334
(Japanese) What did he say?

01:00:44.417 --> 01:00:47.001
(Japanese) He says he wants to eat badly

01:00:47.084 --> 01:00:48.501
Please let them have it

01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:51.292
Don't eat that. Give it to him!

01:00:52.376 --> 01:00:54.209
I made it for him

01:00:54.292 --> 01:00:55.292
(Japanese) Tell them to leave

01:00:55.584 --> 01:00:56.209
Get out of here!

01:00:59.167 --> 01:01:01.709
(Japanese) If your friends
come to rescue you...

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.626
If your friends come to rescue you...

01:01:03.709 --> 01:01:05.542
(Japanese) They'll all be captured

01:01:05.626 --> 01:01:07.126
they'll all be captured

01:01:09.459 --> 01:01:10.292
(Japanese) If they don't,

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:11.334
If they don't,

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.126
(Japanese) then they're not really your friends

01:01:13.376 --> 01:01:14.667
then they're not really your friends

01:01:19.459 --> 01:01:22.251
The Captain says that woman treats you well

01:01:23.459 --> 01:01:25.292
Auntie Qin is truly a great woman

01:01:25.376 --> 01:01:26.251
Talk less!

01:01:33.209 --> 01:01:34.709
How much of the drug did you use?

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:35.876
Enough?

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.834
It ought to be

01:01:40.126 --> 01:01:42.542
I gave him a bigger dose than the donkey!

01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:50.042
You're so greedy!

01:01:50.292 --> 01:01:52.126
There are two pancakes.
You should give him one

01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:54.667
(Japanese) What did he say?

01:01:54.751 --> 01:01:56.292
(Japanese) Nothing

01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:59.167
(Japanese) Tell him that it's delicious

01:01:59.834 --> 01:02:01.334
He really is a bit greedy

01:02:16.334 --> 01:02:17.167
Go!

01:03:26.376 --> 01:03:27.334
(Japanese) Attention!

01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:28.751
(Japanese) You are all excellent marksmen

01:03:29.334 --> 01:03:30.459
(Japanese) When the enemy approaches,

01:03:31.084 --> 01:03:32.084
(Japanese) fire on my order

01:03:32.167 --> 01:03:33.126
(Japanese) Wait for the order

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:35.042
(Japanese) Don't fire until you hear it.
Understand?

01:03:35.126 --> 01:03:35.917
(Japanese) Yes, sir!

01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:37.501
(Japanese) They're all Japanese

01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:38.584
(Japanese) I'm sorry

01:03:39.251 --> 01:03:41.584
(Japanese) Load up and stand by!

01:03:41.667 --> 01:03:42.667
(Japanese) Yes, sir!

01:04:29.001 --> 01:04:30.876
(Japanese) Captain, they're here

01:04:37.209 --> 01:04:38.459
How many Japanese inside?

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:39.667
(Japanese) Sir! What do we do?

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:40.667
(Japanese) Captain!

01:04:42.459 --> 01:04:43.417
(Japanese) Captain!

01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:46.626
(Japanese) Captain! Captain!

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:48.626
Don't move!

01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:54.376
(Japanese) Please give the order to fire! Sir!

01:05:00.209 --> 01:05:02.667
(Japanese) Fire!

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:16.709
Dakui!

01:06:17.126 --> 01:06:18.084
Talk less!

01:06:37.876 --> 01:06:38.917
Thank you all

01:06:39.376 --> 01:06:40.542
Good work, Fan Chuan

01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:42.584
Are you one of us now?

01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:43.501
Shoot!

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.751
Your little band doesn't look proper

01:06:47.834 --> 01:06:49.126
How are we not proper?

01:06:49.209 --> 01:06:50.751
- We have hats like you do!
- Talk less!

01:06:52.501 --> 01:06:53.251
I'll consider it

01:07:07.542 --> 01:07:09.751
No one knows this place. We'll hide here

01:07:13.459 --> 01:07:17.376
I didn't badmouth you.
They were talking that...

01:07:17.459 --> 01:07:18.542
the prisoner train was ambushed

01:07:18.626 --> 01:07:20.292
I know you have nothing to do with it

01:07:20.376 --> 01:07:22.417
I was just blending in with the crowd

01:07:22.501 --> 01:07:25.667
I didn't say you're one of them, I swear

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:28.959
Enough. Take this money

01:07:29.042 --> 01:07:29.876
What is this?

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:30.834
Auntie Qin will know

01:07:31.042 --> 01:07:33.584
Go buy two pancakes, with this money

01:07:33.667 --> 01:07:37.501
No, no, no. I can't take your money...

01:07:38.251 --> 01:07:39.292
Why're you standing there?!

01:07:39.376 --> 01:07:40.209
I'm sorry!

01:07:40.292 --> 01:07:41.584
Get out of here!

01:07:42.876 --> 01:07:43.959
Thief

01:07:44.042 --> 01:07:45.001
(Japanese) Arrest him!

01:07:55.084 --> 01:07:59.501
What's the point of hiding these worn clothes?

01:08:01.459 --> 01:08:04.251
Fan Chuan. You in or out?

01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:05.042
I'm in!

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:07.959
I'm with you all the way

01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:10.959
- That's more like it! Do it together!
- Shoot!

01:08:11.042 --> 01:08:12.167
But I have one condition

01:08:12.667 --> 01:08:14.459
Condition? A businessman!

01:08:14.459 --> 01:08:16.251
Fan Chuan, we have no money

01:08:16.584 --> 01:08:17.501
Say it!

01:08:20.126 --> 01:08:21.084
Don't treat me like an outsider

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.751
I didn't mean it like that

01:08:32.501 --> 01:08:33.917
You ruthless shrew!

01:08:35.126 --> 01:08:38.209
I really don't know anything...so painful

01:08:38.292 --> 01:08:39.584
(Japanese) Yuko!

01:08:52.126 --> 01:08:53.542
I didn't see anything

01:09:02.876 --> 01:09:05.709
Stop! I'll talk! They're at Weishan Lake!

01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:19.959
"The evening sun is setting in the west"

01:09:20.667 --> 01:09:26.417
"Weishan Lake is peaceful and still"

01:09:26.792 --> 01:09:28.709
"I will go..."

01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:30.376
Brother, your key is too low

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:33.084
I'm not too low. He was high!

01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:36.917
He was too low.
I think Brother is singing it good

01:09:37.459 --> 01:09:38.917
You're clearly singing too low

01:09:39.001 --> 01:09:39.917
I'm too low?

01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:41.084
Or you're too high

01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:44.251
I choose the key so I'm right. He sang too low

01:09:44.334 --> 01:09:47.084
My key's correct. Peaceful and still

01:09:47.376 --> 01:09:48.667
- Brother's correct
- But I set the key

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:49.667
Then you set the wrong key!

01:09:49.751 --> 01:09:51.042
Start it again

01:09:51.626 --> 01:09:52.376
"The evening..."

01:09:52.459 --> 01:09:54.626
See? Too high!

01:09:54.876 --> 01:09:57.459
Peaceful and still

01:10:14.667 --> 01:10:17.751
Brother! It's the Japanese!

01:10:21.667 --> 01:10:22.459
How many bullets do we have left?

01:10:24.167 --> 01:10:25.459
I can kill one with each...

01:10:30.917 --> 01:10:31.876
Get down!

01:10:36.959 --> 01:10:39.001
(Japanese) Give me the gun

01:10:39.917 --> 01:10:40.834
You want to fight your way out?

01:10:42.292 --> 01:10:43.334
We can't do that now

01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:45.167
There's only one way out. Move

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:38.334
They're gone...

01:11:54.001 --> 01:11:55.251
(Japanese) Found them?

01:11:57.042 --> 01:11:57.626
Hai!

01:11:57.792 --> 01:11:59.167
- (Japanese) Where are they?
- Hai!

01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:02.792
(Japanese) Where are your guns?

01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:04.584
(Japanese) Banzai!

01:12:05.292 --> 01:12:07.501
(Japanese) Banzai!

01:12:07.792 --> 01:12:10.209
(Japanese) Banzai!

01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:14.084
(Japanese) Banzai!

01:12:15.876 --> 01:12:16.459
Hurry!

01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:18.834
(Japanese) Banzai!

01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:44.167
(Japanese) Where are they?!

01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:53.167
(Japanese) You idiot!!

01:12:54.084 --> 01:12:57.251
Hanzhuang Bridge is a major route

01:12:57.542 --> 01:13:01.376
The Japanese need it to send supplies
to the front line

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:05.167
I think that's why the Eighth
wants to blow it up

01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:06.834
They want to cut their supplies

01:13:06.917 --> 01:13:07.542
Be careful

01:13:08.459 --> 01:13:12.459
Fan Chuan. In the, 36 stratagems.
What's this called?

01:13:12.542 --> 01:13:13.209
"Taking the fuel"

01:13:14.334 --> 01:13:15.417
It doesn't matter now

01:13:15.917 --> 01:13:18.459
The Eighth says the bridge must be
destroyed by tomorrow

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:21.667
You haven't told us why you decided to join us

01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:25.084
Would you let people call you a coward?

01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:37.542
Auntie Qin told me to bring him

01:13:39.751 --> 01:13:42.959
Huang gave it to me before he was arrested

01:13:44.084 --> 01:13:45.709
What's that traitor up to?

01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:48.709
He asked me to buy pancakes from Auntie Qin

01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:49.501
I can't see it

01:13:52.251 --> 01:13:53.542
What does it say?

01:13:54.209 --> 01:13:57.709
A supply train is
crossing Hanzhuang Bridge tomorrow

01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:58.876
What does that mean?

01:13:58.959 --> 01:14:01.626
Supply train...we have our explosives!

01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:03.667
Can we trust that traitor's words?

01:14:03.751 --> 01:14:05.959
That traitor sent the Japanese
to the island for us

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.209
And now he let us go!

01:14:07.459 --> 01:14:08.334
What is he up to?

01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:10.792
Means he changes sides whenever it suits him

01:14:11.084 --> 01:14:12.042
I've seen people like him

01:14:12.209 --> 01:14:13.126
I believe him this time

01:14:13.209 --> 01:14:16.126
Either way, this is our only chance

01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:22.667
Ask your spirits! Where are they hiding?

01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:26.459
There'll be many Japanese
on that train tomorrow

01:14:26.542 --> 01:14:27.376
We're outnumbered

01:14:27.459 --> 01:14:28.792
We need more men

01:14:29.459 --> 01:14:31.042
I'll go!

01:14:31.126 --> 01:14:32.001
Me, too!

01:14:32.084 --> 01:14:33.876
Not you

01:14:33.959 --> 01:14:39.001
Abracadabra...something big is happening soon

01:14:39.167 --> 01:14:40.959
Ow, that hurts!

01:14:41.042 --> 01:14:42.167
My leg!

01:14:43.834 --> 01:14:46.126
Abracadabra...

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:49.709
Great!

01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:52.709
I've waited for this too long!

01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:54.042
So we'll leave it to you?

01:14:54.126 --> 01:14:55.709
Sure. Don't worry

01:14:59.042 --> 01:15:00.584
Listen, everyone

01:15:02.001 --> 01:15:04.376
If we really are blowing up the bridge

01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:06.334
We won't make it back

01:15:08.042 --> 01:15:09.459
Do you understand me?

01:15:10.834 --> 01:15:12.959
If anyone wants to back out,

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:14.667
say it now

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:22.459
Well?

01:15:22.959 --> 01:15:25.292
Yes! Let's do it!

01:15:25.376 --> 01:15:26.542
The Tigers aren't cowards!

01:15:26.626 --> 01:15:28.584
We'd rather die than be slaves

01:15:29.584 --> 01:15:30.917
For our country!

01:15:31.167 --> 01:15:31.959
We all have a duty!

01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:34.876
Silence! Let Brother speak!

01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:37.876
Brother, what'd you say?

01:15:39.626 --> 01:15:40.667
Right! Brother

01:15:40.751 --> 01:15:42.959
You should say something wise!

01:15:50.626 --> 01:15:52.001
Talk less!

01:16:06.292 --> 01:16:09.542
Eat up before fighting the Japanese

01:16:09.626 --> 01:16:11.209
Make it home alive...

01:16:11.792 --> 01:16:13.751
and you can eat pancakes all you want. Okay?

01:16:13.834 --> 01:16:15.709
You hear me?

01:16:19.667 --> 01:16:23.251
Say, Brother. Why do you carry that
pipe with you?

01:16:24.001 --> 01:16:26.834
He used to smoke, but not anymore

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:28.626
He misses the taste

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:31.417
The truth is,

01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:35.667
years ago, my father was smoking this...

01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:37.667
when the Japanese shot him

01:16:38.751 --> 01:16:42.501
Later, my wife was killed by the Japanese,

01:16:43.126 --> 01:16:44.709
while loading the tobacco for me

01:16:45.792 --> 01:16:47.001
I don't smoke now

01:16:48.542 --> 01:16:50.542
But, I'll remember my grudge

01:16:56.626 --> 01:16:59.126
Sing a song, Dahai

01:16:59.334 --> 01:17:03.542
No way. They keep saying that I'm off-key

01:17:03.626 --> 01:17:04.751
You do go off-key...

01:17:04.834 --> 01:17:05.709
I don't!

01:17:05.959 --> 01:17:06.667
Never mind

01:17:08.042 --> 01:17:08.834
What's the plan tomorrow?

01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:11.876
Well

01:17:13.417 --> 01:17:15.709
Tomorrow when the train leaves Shagou Station

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:17.167
We hop aboard

01:17:17.251 --> 01:17:18.542
First, find the explosives

01:17:19.126 --> 01:17:21.501
They should be in a closed cargo hold

01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:25.001
The Japanese will inspect the train
at Zaozhuang Station

01:17:25.084 --> 01:17:27.959
We'll hide, making our move
as the train leaves!

01:17:29.126 --> 01:17:32.209
The train mustn't stop under any circumstance

01:17:33.251 --> 01:17:34.542
We'll stop the train
in the middle of the bridge

01:17:34.959 --> 01:17:37.626
Wrap the explosives around the bridge pillars

01:17:37.834 --> 01:17:40.542
When they explode. The bridge will collapse

01:17:41.792 --> 01:17:42.792
You understand?

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:46.584
But what will happen to you?

01:17:47.376 --> 01:17:51.667
Duang! Into the air. Mission accomplished

01:18:43.459 --> 01:18:44.292
Dad!

01:18:44.876 --> 01:18:45.542
Why're you here?

01:18:45.626 --> 01:18:46.917
I have to be with you all!

01:18:48.959 --> 01:18:50.667
Get off the train before we blow the bridge

01:18:51.376 --> 01:18:52.376
Fine

01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:02.667
Give me that

01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:03.792
Blow it!

01:19:09.042 --> 01:19:10.084
Let's go

01:19:37.084 --> 01:19:39.251
- Go away!
- Sir! I can't move them

01:19:47.126 --> 01:19:48.876
I'm sorry, sir!

01:20:11.501 --> 01:20:13.042
Cargo holds, front and back

01:20:13.626 --> 01:20:14.501
Who's going to check them?

01:20:14.584 --> 01:20:16.792
I'll check the back

01:20:16.876 --> 01:20:19.542
I'll bet that they're in the front. I'll go

01:20:19.792 --> 01:20:20.792
Go to the back,

01:20:20.876 --> 01:20:23.084
You're clumsy. I'll check the front

01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:25.126
Zhu, you stand guard

01:20:25.209 --> 01:20:25.792
I'll take the cab

01:20:25.876 --> 01:20:28.501
The rest of you, hide.
Wail till we leave the station

01:20:29.167 --> 01:20:29.876
Shoot!

01:21:01.542 --> 01:21:06.459
"BLOW UP THE BRIDGE"

01:21:17.001 --> 01:21:18.084
(Japanese) Attention!

01:21:23.167 --> 01:21:24.709
(Japanese) Sir! Your orders?

01:21:26.667 --> 01:21:29.292
Who said the explosives would be here?

01:21:34.876 --> 01:21:35.792
(Japanese) Sit down!

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:37.042
(Japanese) Go ahead, sir!

01:21:44.126 --> 01:21:45.626
(Japanese) Rock, paper, scissors!

01:21:49.251 --> 01:21:51.417
(Japanese) Again! Rock, paper, scissors!

01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:56.501
(Japanese) Sit down!

01:21:56.584 --> 01:21:57.459
(Japanese) Be seated!

01:22:06.167 --> 01:22:07.667
(Japanese) Rock, paper, scissors!

01:22:45.751 --> 01:22:47.792
(Japanese) Why are you crying?

01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:58.042
(Japanese) I'm so moved,
but bad things happen when I smile

01:23:19.751 --> 01:23:21.167
(Japanese) Everything good?

01:23:21.292 --> 01:23:22.917
(Japanese) Everything's fine, sir

01:23:23.542 --> 01:23:24.667
(Japanese) Are you sure?

01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:29.251
(Japanese) Of course.
I'll commit seppuku otherwise

01:23:30.917 --> 01:23:32.209
(Japanese) That's gonna hurt

01:23:34.501 --> 01:23:35.751
(Japanese) This is no time for jokes!

01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:46.792
(Japanese) Open the door

01:23:49.376 --> 01:23:50.292
(Japanese) Stand up!

01:24:11.376 --> 01:24:13.042
(Japanese) What are you wearing underneath?

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:17.376
(Japanese) Same as you

01:24:21.292 --> 01:24:22.459
(Japanese) I'm serious

01:24:23.209 --> 01:24:24.251
(Japanese) Close the door

01:24:25.751 --> 01:24:26.501
(Japanese) Close the door!

01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:30.459
(Japanese) Raise your hands!

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.626
(Japanese) What's going on here, sir?

01:24:43.084 --> 01:24:44.167
(Japanese) She was being rude

01:24:55.501 --> 01:24:57.376
(Japanese) He's a fraud

01:24:57.584 --> 01:24:58.251
(Japanese) Fire!

01:24:59.376 --> 01:25:00.209
(Japanese) Fire!

01:25:03.459 --> 01:25:04.334
(Japanese) Where's Yuko?

01:25:04.417 --> 01:25:05.709
(Japanese) She's still on the train

01:25:07.792 --> 01:25:08.917
(Japanese) Give me a smile

01:25:12.251 --> 01:25:13.001
(Japanese) Don't move!

01:25:16.834 --> 01:25:18.417
(Japanese) Hey!

01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:19.501
(Japanese) Give me a smile

01:25:19.584 --> 01:25:20.584
(Japanese) There it is!

01:25:25.751 --> 01:25:27.459
I told you not to move

01:25:33.209 --> 01:25:34.626
Don't move! I'll shoot anyone that moves!

01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:36.584
I'll shoot anyone that moves!

01:26:05.084 --> 01:26:07.042
(Japanese) Squad, engage!

01:26:29.126 --> 01:26:30.042
If you hadn't come,

01:26:30.126 --> 01:26:32.459
I'd have shown them my shooting skills!

01:26:39.251 --> 01:26:40.251
Go where?

01:26:40.917 --> 01:26:41.542
(Japanese) Fire!

01:26:44.251 --> 01:26:45.209
Don't push!

01:26:53.126 --> 01:26:54.501
Got the explosives?

01:27:06.126 --> 01:27:08.209
Zhu. Get on top of the last carriages!

01:27:08.292 --> 01:27:09.126
Don't let them attack

01:27:09.209 --> 01:27:10.292
- Everyone...
- Watch out!

01:27:13.417 --> 01:27:15.167
Everyone what?

01:27:16.126 --> 01:27:17.292
I've forgotten

01:27:25.834 --> 01:27:27.376
Block the side door, Brother.
Don't let them out

01:27:28.292 --> 01:27:30.084
You go help Sanlaizi

01:27:30.167 --> 01:27:31.084
Okay

01:27:31.167 --> 01:27:32.126
The rest of you, help me with the cannon

01:27:32.917 --> 01:27:33.959
I don't know how to fire a cannon!

01:27:34.042 --> 01:27:35.376
- I do!
- Where's the ammo?

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.251
Over there, under that cloth. Go!

01:27:37.334 --> 01:27:38.751
I have bullets in my bag. Get them!

01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:56.834
"December moon, what flowers will you bloom!"

01:27:57.084 --> 01:28:00.292
"December flowers will bloom..."

01:28:02.334 --> 01:28:06.292
You almost hit me!

01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:12.501
- Hurry!
- Dad, I'm useful!

01:28:12.584 --> 01:28:14.042
Talk less! Hurry!

01:28:16.501 --> 01:28:18.126
Come help us, Brother!

01:28:19.084 --> 01:28:20.542
I'm busy too!

01:28:34.417 --> 01:28:35.417
Where should i put this?

01:28:35.501 --> 01:28:36.834
Blow them away!

01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:38.209
Place it aside. Don't rush!

01:28:40.334 --> 01:28:41.209
What are you doing?

01:28:41.292 --> 01:28:42.042
I'm aiming

01:28:44.876 --> 01:28:46.126
Lift the cannon

01:28:46.209 --> 01:28:48.209
One, two, three! Go!

01:28:48.292 --> 01:28:49.917
Wait! What are you doing?

01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:52.001
- Push it in
- Good! One, two, three!

01:28:52.084 --> 01:28:53.792
This isn't the proper way!

01:28:53.876 --> 01:28:55.959
We don't do things the proper way! Push!

01:29:01.959 --> 01:29:02.709
Fire!

01:29:02.792 --> 01:29:04.167
- What?
- Fire!

01:29:04.584 --> 01:29:05.792
(Japanese) Get away!

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:07.667
Pull!

01:29:11.292 --> 01:29:12.959
- How?
- Pull it back hard!

01:29:41.001 --> 01:29:41.876
(Japanese) What is going on?!

01:29:42.917 --> 01:29:45.084
That was a pretty good idea, right?

01:29:45.376 --> 01:29:46.959
This is definitely not proper...

01:29:49.376 --> 01:29:50.251
- Again!
- Yes!

01:29:53.667 --> 01:29:55.626
Fire again. I'll help the others

01:29:58.709 --> 01:30:00.292
And me?

01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:03.001
Keep covering your ears

01:30:09.126 --> 01:30:10.084
Be careful

01:30:18.584 --> 01:30:19.501
Explosives there?

01:30:19.959 --> 01:30:20.792
A lot!

01:30:21.084 --> 01:30:21.876
Set one off!

01:30:21.959 --> 01:30:22.751
Sure!

01:30:31.084 --> 01:30:32.917
Fire in the hole!

01:30:45.334 --> 01:30:46.251
Watch out!

01:31:00.459 --> 01:31:01.042
Get away!

01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:43.459
(Japanese) That really hurts...

01:32:15.959 --> 01:32:16.917
(Japanese) Shoot!

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:36.584
(Japanese) Darn it!

01:32:47.959 --> 01:32:49.251
Alright then let's play

01:33:07.667 --> 01:33:09.417
(Japanese) It's those hicks!

01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:12.042
Guys, leave it to me

01:33:23.667 --> 01:33:25.334
Blow him away!

01:33:49.334 --> 01:33:51.292
I may have lost to you years ago...

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:55.501
(Japanese) You hicks!

01:33:55.709 --> 01:33:57.751
But I'll get you today

01:34:34.459 --> 01:34:35.459
Shoot!

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:15.584
Watch out!

01:35:17.667 --> 01:35:19.709
That really hurts

01:35:20.084 --> 01:35:21.084
Dakui!

01:35:21.834 --> 01:35:22.626
Are you hurt?

01:35:24.376 --> 01:35:25.584
How many of these do we have to tie up?

01:35:25.667 --> 01:35:27.501
The more the better!

01:35:36.751 --> 01:35:38.292
I'll pay you back some day

01:35:38.376 --> 01:35:39.167
Talk less!

01:35:39.292 --> 01:35:40.334
It hurts!

01:36:04.001 --> 01:36:07.084
Don't let the train stop, Rui!

01:36:14.417 --> 01:36:17.834
Dahai, don't you think that Xing'er likes me?

01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:24.834
Where did that come from?

01:36:29.417 --> 01:36:31.542
The train can't stop! The train can't stop!

01:36:45.542 --> 01:36:47.501
This is easy and boring

01:36:51.626 --> 01:36:52.709
Come on!

01:37:01.042 --> 01:37:04.334
I'll show you what a proper solder...

01:37:07.376 --> 01:37:08.251
can do!

01:37:16.251 --> 01:37:17.376
- Shoot!
- Good work!

01:37:47.001 --> 01:37:49.084
What's that?

01:38:06.584 --> 01:38:07.709
Fan Chuan

01:38:08.459 --> 01:38:10.542
Look what we found!

01:38:13.334 --> 01:38:14.251
Quick! Give me!

01:38:23.917 --> 01:38:25.751
Brother, the boiler is leaking

01:38:26.542 --> 01:38:27.292
Dakui

01:38:36.542 --> 01:38:38.001
Zhuzi's fallen off the train!

01:38:39.084 --> 01:38:40.334
(Japanese) Surrender!

01:38:40.417 --> 01:38:41.459
What are they saying?

01:38:41.542 --> 01:38:42.459
They're asking us to surrender

01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:44.292
I'll shoot the one talking. You take the other

01:38:44.917 --> 01:38:47.042
Wait, that's too risky

01:38:47.126 --> 01:38:48.084
He's right behind Xing'er

01:38:49.209 --> 01:38:50.376
Aren't you a sharpshooter?

01:38:50.459 --> 01:38:52.042
No sharpshooter can curve a bullet

01:38:53.126 --> 01:38:54.001
Come back, Dahai

01:38:54.792 --> 01:38:55.459
I'm coming, Xing'er

01:38:55.542 --> 01:38:56.626
- Xing'er
- Stay back!

01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:58.584
- Dahai
- Come back here too, Sanlaizi!

01:38:59.042 --> 01:39:02.959
Just listen to me and stay over there

01:39:14.417 --> 01:39:16.292
A tiger? Are there wings on that?

01:39:26.751 --> 01:39:27.584
What'll we do?

01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:29.042
I don't have any experience with this

01:39:54.501 --> 01:39:55.542
Run, Xing'er!

01:40:17.292 --> 01:40:18.834
Just leave them to me!

01:40:19.209 --> 01:40:20.709
Everyone back off!

01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:29.084
I'm not afraid, Dad!

01:40:29.167 --> 01:40:29.792
It's okay

01:40:47.084 --> 01:40:50.167
Time to go. You promised

01:40:51.126 --> 01:40:58.001
I want to be with you all to the end!

01:40:58.209 --> 01:40:59.667
We'll be back soon

01:41:05.001 --> 01:41:06.167
Dad!

01:41:07.834 --> 01:41:08.542
Xing'er

01:41:10.084 --> 01:41:10.959
Come

01:41:13.542 --> 01:41:14.876
What are you doing?

01:41:15.334 --> 01:41:16.334
Roll

01:41:17.126 --> 01:41:17.751
Roll!

01:41:19.626 --> 01:41:20.751
Don't let her go!

01:41:34.209 --> 01:41:36.667
The boiler's leaking.
We might not make it to the bridge

01:41:38.126 --> 01:41:39.334
Get your weapons, boys!

01:41:39.417 --> 01:41:40.292
Shoot!

01:41:44.667 --> 01:41:46.376
The train is stopping, Brother

01:41:47.917 --> 01:41:49.167
We've nowhere to retreat

01:41:52.917 --> 01:41:54.251
We'll fight them!

01:41:54.334 --> 01:41:55.251
Shoot!

01:42:31.376 --> 01:42:33.042
Now!

01:42:54.376 --> 01:42:55.209
(Japanese) Retreat

01:42:55.792 --> 01:42:57.251
This rifle is no fun

01:42:57.334 --> 01:42:58.834
- How about this one?
- Great!

01:43:07.709 --> 01:43:08.751
This is awesome!

01:43:14.167 --> 01:43:15.042
Dahai!

01:43:21.542 --> 01:43:22.292
Someone's joining the party

01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:29.542
(Japanese) I'm back, you hicks!

01:43:34.834 --> 01:43:37.376
Watch me. I'll blow him away with the tank

01:43:41.209 --> 01:43:42.167
What do we do now?

01:43:42.251 --> 01:43:44.042
We still have our cannon

01:43:51.501 --> 01:43:52.542
Now what?

01:43:53.167 --> 01:43:54.542
(Japanese) You want to beat me?

01:44:10.209 --> 01:44:12.709
This is bad. We're running out of ammo

01:44:23.542 --> 01:44:25.667
Not blown up yet? No way

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:28.667
Rui!

01:44:32.042 --> 01:44:33.334
Aren't the explosives over there?

01:44:33.417 --> 01:44:35.417
We'll each take one pack
and charge at them, maybe...

01:44:35.501 --> 01:44:37.542
It's useless. We won't make it past them

01:44:40.167 --> 01:44:42.459
We were so close!

01:44:45.834 --> 01:44:47.834
Looks like our big mission is set to fail

01:44:48.292 --> 01:44:49.751
I started this mission,

01:44:49.834 --> 01:44:50.876
so I'll see this through

01:44:50.959 --> 01:44:52.084
You guys still have a chance to flee

01:44:52.167 --> 01:44:53.667
Talk less!

01:44:56.251 --> 01:44:57.792
You're not the only member of the Tigers

01:44:57.876 --> 01:44:59.042
None of us are running

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:00.042
We may not be proper soldiers,

01:45:00.126 --> 01:45:01.459
but we do just fine against the Japanese

01:45:01.542 --> 01:45:03.042
Tell us. What to do!

01:45:03.459 --> 01:45:04.084
Shoot!

01:45:11.042 --> 01:45:13.626
I don't think we can take them head on

01:45:14.167 --> 01:45:17.167
How does the 36 Strategems go?

01:45:17.626 --> 01:45:18.917
How would I know
which one you're talking about?!

01:45:20.001 --> 01:45:23.376
We will hide!

01:45:24.667 --> 01:45:27.667
(Japanese) You'll never beat me.
Not in a million years!

01:45:33.626 --> 01:45:35.792
Switch the tracks!

01:45:35.959 --> 01:45:37.459
I'll block the train

01:45:37.542 --> 01:45:38.167
Got it!

01:45:45.792 --> 01:45:47.709
- What are you doing?
- Your dad said don't let go!

01:45:47.792 --> 01:45:48.792
Let me go!

01:45:59.751 --> 01:46:00.876
You got a death wish?

01:46:12.959 --> 01:46:14.167
(Japanese) Search the train!

01:46:23.167 --> 01:46:23.876
I speak Chinese!

01:46:25.459 --> 01:46:27.542
I'll say it clearly this time

01:46:28.292 --> 01:46:30.459
You have two choices

01:46:30.542 --> 01:46:33.334
One, I knock you both out

01:46:35.084 --> 01:46:36.292
Two...

01:46:46.251 --> 01:46:47.959
Zhuzi!

01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:51.084
Who's on the train?

01:46:55.501 --> 01:46:56.417
Put your backs into it!

01:47:06.001 --> 01:47:07.167
It won't budge!

01:47:10.459 --> 01:47:11.459
Dakui?

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:13.417
- Why are we pulling that?
- Talk less!

01:47:13.876 --> 01:47:15.167
Move! Hurry

01:47:23.917 --> 01:47:25.042
Why won't you go away?!

01:47:43.084 --> 01:47:44.167
Can't stop it now

01:47:49.251 --> 01:47:50.709
What is he doing?

01:47:56.959 --> 01:47:58.001
(Japanese) We've got nothing, sir!

01:47:58.167 --> 01:47:59.126
(Japanese) We've got nothing, sir!

01:47:59.501 --> 01:48:00.667
(Japanese) We've got nothing, sir!

01:48:01.542 --> 01:48:02.792
(Japanese) Found them?

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:04.209
(Japanese) No, sir

01:48:04.292 --> 01:48:05.751
(Japanese) Search again!

01:48:05.834 --> 01:48:06.709
(Japanese) Yes, sir!

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:55.084
(Japanese) Back away! Back away!

01:48:55.167 --> 01:48:55.792
(Japanese) Back away!

01:48:57.376 --> 01:48:58.792
(Japanese) Don't move!

01:49:00.542 --> 01:49:01.251
(Japanese) You hicks!

01:49:10.209 --> 01:49:12.126
(Japanese) Back away!

01:50:52.751 --> 01:50:53.876
Shoot!

01:50:55.251 --> 01:50:55.917
Xiaohu!

01:51:54.167 --> 01:51:55.084
Brother

01:51:56.751 --> 01:51:58.042
Who's driving that train?

01:51:58.126 --> 01:51:59.209
It must be Rui

01:52:04.917 --> 01:52:06.292
We're the only ones left!

01:52:12.001 --> 01:52:14.792
Keep them back.
I'm going to set off the explosives

01:52:14.917 --> 01:52:16.959
Hurry! We can't hold them off for long

01:52:17.292 --> 01:52:18.167
Brother!

01:52:18.876 --> 01:52:19.876
Talk less!

01:52:28.792 --> 01:52:29.417
Brother!

01:53:01.001 --> 01:53:02.501
We can't hold them any longer

01:53:23.834 --> 01:53:25.584
Why won't that Japanese die?!

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:29.876
I have you now

01:53:33.834 --> 01:53:34.751
I have you now

01:53:36.292 --> 01:53:38.501
Are you going to shoot or what?
Can you do this?

01:53:38.584 --> 01:53:40.626
They're too close. I'll hit both of them

01:55:21.917 --> 01:55:23.876
(Japanese) Hold your fire!

01:55:23.959 --> 01:55:26.126
(Japanese) I'll get him myself

01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:30.709
Brother, looks like our mission has failed

01:55:32.334 --> 01:55:34.959
I'm sorry I couldn't hold them

01:55:35.834 --> 01:55:37.501
We've failed Daguo and the Eighth

01:55:58.376 --> 01:55:59.751
(Japanese) We'll start with you

01:56:06.084 --> 01:56:06.709
(Japanese) What's going on?!

01:56:17.042 --> 01:56:18.584
Charge!

01:56:20.792 --> 01:56:23.084
(Japanese) Fire! Kill them all!

01:56:25.667 --> 01:56:27.042
(Japanese) Go, all of you!

01:56:27.126 --> 01:56:28.251
(Japanese) Kill them all!

01:56:52.792 --> 01:56:53.959
(Japanese) All of you, go!

01:56:54.667 --> 01:56:55.709
(Japanese) Don't worry about those guys...

01:56:55.792 --> 01:56:57.126
(Japanese) I can handle them myself

01:57:30.834 --> 01:57:32.334
I'll kill you!

01:57:34.376 --> 01:57:37.501
(Japanese) That hurts!

01:58:31.251 --> 01:58:35.709
Charge!

01:59:09.334 --> 01:59:12.042
(Japanese) You hicks...

02:00:26.667 --> 02:00:29.251
Tiger. Come on, time to go

02:00:29.667 --> 02:00:31.626
Can this be our secret?

02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:33.334
Sure, no problem

02:00:33.417 --> 02:00:35.376
Did they all go to heaven?

02:00:35.459 --> 02:00:36.334
Actually...

02:00:36.417 --> 02:00:38.501
they all joined
the Eighth Route Army afterwards,

02:00:38.584 --> 02:00:40.209
and protected our country

02:00:40.292 --> 02:00:42.042
What about the injured soldier?

02:00:42.959 --> 02:00:44.584
Did he go to heaven?

02:00:47.251 --> 02:00:50.626
That's another story. Do you want to hear it?

02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:51.542
Yeah!

02:00:52.417 --> 02:00:54.042
Okay, I'll tell you

02:01:22.751 --> 02:01:24.501
Sorry, my hat fell off

02:01:28.542 --> 02:01:30.417
Hit me? You hit me?!

02:01:31.209 --> 02:01:33.376
I forgot my lines...Sorry

02:01:33.459 --> 02:01:34.751
Running around...And I...I...

02:01:37.084 --> 02:01:41.209
I'm Dahai, he's Daguo, and you are?

02:01:41.292 --> 02:01:42.626
I'm Daguo

02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:44.501
What's your character's name?

02:01:44.584 --> 02:01:47.167
I'm Dahai, he's Daguo...

02:01:50.126 --> 02:01:51.917
What's your name?

02:01:52.001 --> 02:01:54.501
I'm Ma Yun...Ma Yuan

02:02:04.292 --> 02:02:07.167
Again. I almost fell off

02:02:07.417 --> 02:02:08.751
I almost...

02:02:09.334 --> 02:02:10.459
You want me to do it again?

02:02:10.542 --> 02:02:12.042
Sorry, sorry...

02:02:14.751 --> 02:02:16.251
I don't know how to draw it

02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:30.667
It's so cold that I can't speak. Again!

02:02:31.626 --> 02:02:32.917
...there are no Howards

02:02:33.542 --> 02:02:34.584
Cowards!

02:02:38.292 --> 02:02:39.667
You said your mother killed you

02:02:40.334 --> 02:02:41.917
You said your mother killed you!

02:02:45.834 --> 02:02:48.084
Wait, I sang the wrong song

02:02:48.334 --> 02:02:51.751
The evening...I've forgotten

02:02:51.834 --> 02:02:54.251
The evening sun...

02:02:54.334 --> 02:02:59.542
"The evening sun is setting in the west"

02:02:59.626 --> 02:03:05.417
"The evening sun is setting in the west"

02:03:09.251 --> 02:03:10.792
What lake?

02:03:11.334 --> 02:03:12.834
Weishan Lake! Again

02:03:12.917 --> 02:03:15.376
They're at Weishan Lake!

02:03:16.305 --> 02:03:22.712
