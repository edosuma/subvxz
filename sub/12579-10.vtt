00:32.662 --> 00:35.597
BILL: A Texas Native license plate.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.801
It's got that new license plate smell.

00:39.969 --> 00:43.234
Boy! A set of those
sure would look sharp on my truck.

00:43.706 --> 00:45.469
Heck, they'd look sharp anywhere.

00:45.575 --> 00:46.564
I tell you what, man...

00:46.676 --> 00:50.339
talking about them, they add 20%
on the blue-book value, man.

00:50.446 --> 00:53.381
That is a capital idea with a capital "I."

00:53.483 --> 00:55.348
Then all three of us will have them.

00:55.451 --> 00:58.682
No offense, Bill,
you being from Loseranna.

01:00.723 --> 01:04.056
And my plates usually
are so covered with mud anyway.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.525
I really want one!

01:05.628 --> 01:08.825
It's okay, Bill, you can ride with me
after I put my new plates on.

01:08.932 --> 01:11.924
- I don't care where you're from.
- Thank you, Hank.

01:12.035 --> 01:15.198
Just duck down
whenever I pass another real Texan.

01:19.676 --> 01:23.874
HANK: Any sign of my birth certificate yet?
PEGGY: To be perfectly honest, no.

01:24.147 --> 01:26.115
I'd better call my mom.

01:26.215 --> 01:29.673
I'm pretty sure the license people
are gonna need to see a birth certificate.

01:29.786 --> 01:32.084
Otherwise, you'd have
a bunch of Oklahomans...

01:32.188 --> 01:34.588
trying to get Texas Native plates.

01:35.258 --> 01:36.555
TILLIE: Hello?
HANK: Mom?

01:36.659 --> 01:38.388
Look, this isn't a social call.

01:38.494 --> 01:41.622
I'm just phoning to get a copy
of my birth certificate.

01:41.731 --> 01:43.164
Your birth certificate?

01:43.266 --> 01:45.564
Well, what makes you think
I'd have something like that?

01:45.668 --> 01:47.829
Because I wouldn't. And I don't.

01:49.672 --> 01:53.130
- That was weird.
- Well, I found my birth certificate.

01:53.576 --> 01:56.010
Seven pounds, six ounces. Perfect.

01:58.915 --> 02:00.109
Hey, Dad.

02:00.216 --> 02:03.879
I got you a little housewarming present.
A basket of fruit.

02:04.187 --> 02:07.156
Peggy made it up for you.
It's mostly oranges.

02:07.824 --> 02:09.758
Is that a kiwi in there?

02:09.859 --> 02:13.386
- You know how I feel about hairy fruits.
- Yeah.

02:13.663 --> 02:14.652
So...

02:14.764 --> 02:17.255
Hey, when you were packing up the house
in Houston...

02:17.367 --> 02:20.393
did you happen to come across
my birth certificate?

02:20.503 --> 02:21.629
[G.H. Crying]

02:21.904 --> 02:25.169
You think I got enough room
in this cracker box for your baby crap?

02:25.274 --> 02:27.674
Well, maybe you could have
kept my birth certificate...

02:27.777 --> 02:29.642
and tossed out some of those videos.

02:29.746 --> 02:32.874
Those videos are of G.H.
They mean something to me.

02:32.982 --> 02:33.971
[G.H. Coughing]

02:34.083 --> 02:36.847
Didi, get the camera. He's doing it again.

02:40.490 --> 02:43.254
If I didn't know those two
hadn't spoken in four years...

02:43.359 --> 02:45.850
I'd swear they were
in some kind of conspiracy.

02:45.962 --> 02:48.897
Well, either this is your dream
and I am in it...

02:48.998 --> 02:52.126
or this is your life and your parents
are acting weird...

02:52.268 --> 02:54.133
because you're adopted.

02:54.270 --> 02:55.430
Adopted?

02:55.538 --> 02:59.872
- No, my dad hates adopted children.
- Exactly.

02:59.976 --> 03:02.103
Which is why Cotton
treats your brother G. H...

03:02.211 --> 03:05.146
who we know for sure is not adopted
much better than you...

03:05.248 --> 03:08.513
whose parentage is,
let's face it, a question mark.

03:10.053 --> 03:13.181
My mom wouldn't just hang up on me
for no reason.

03:13.990 --> 03:16.288
God, maybe I really am adopted!

03:16.526 --> 03:20.963
Well, there would be clues.
Think back to when you were a child.

03:21.497 --> 03:25.433
Now, Hank,
did your parents ever tell you...

03:25.535 --> 03:27.162
you were adopted?

03:28.137 --> 03:29.968
- Hank?
- Hank.

03:30.740 --> 03:32.867
How do I even know that's my name?

03:33.209 --> 03:36.269
My real parents
might have called me Henry...

03:36.379 --> 03:37.710
or Chris.

03:38.414 --> 03:40.780
God, Peggy. What if I'm a Chris?

03:43.786 --> 03:48.223
Well, if I was adopted
that means my real dad could be anybody.

03:49.826 --> 03:52.056
Hey, maybe even Tom Landry.

03:52.462 --> 03:56.228
I do have his strong chin
and love for the flex defense.

03:56.466 --> 03:59.731
I wonder if I would have called him
Dad or Coach?

04:01.104 --> 04:05.302
Who am I kidding? It would have been sir.

04:06.309 --> 04:09.335
Before we sue the Landry estate
for child support...

04:09.479 --> 04:11.538
I'm gonna need your social.

04:13.850 --> 04:15.442
[Dale whistling]

04:16.519 --> 04:18.543
135-016-629.

04:22.225 --> 04:24.455
Now we download, enter.

04:24.727 --> 04:26.820
9%, 57%, 100%.

04:27.764 --> 04:30.096
Hank, are you standing on the cable?

04:30.199 --> 04:33.430
It says here your birth parents
were Tillie and Cotton Hill.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.738
Well, I guess that's a relief.

04:36.139 --> 04:39.631
At least I can keep loving my mom.
Let me take a look.

04:40.543 --> 04:44.172
"Place of birth: New York, New York?"

04:45.948 --> 04:47.006
[Hank screaming]

04:51.354 --> 04:53.788
How come you never told me
I was born in New York?

04:53.923 --> 04:55.481
What? New York?

04:56.526 --> 04:59.518
You wasn't. You was adopted.

04:59.996 --> 05:03.557
Yeah. Worst $50 I ever spent.

05:03.666 --> 05:06.464
Could've got me a matching pair
of Chinese babies for $10.

05:06.569 --> 05:10.733
I was born in New York City, of your seed.

05:12.308 --> 05:13.366
Hank!

05:13.876 --> 05:15.707
I always knew the day would come...

05:15.812 --> 05:18.747
when I'd have to tell you
the whole sad story.

05:18.848 --> 05:21.783
Maybe it was my fault
for loving your mother so much...

05:21.884 --> 05:24.444
back when she was still worth loving.

05:25.121 --> 05:27.521
COTTON: Tillie had always wanted
to see New York City.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.983
She heard about it at the beauty parlor.

05:32.695 --> 05:34.390
Well, you weren't due
for another few weeks...

05:34.497 --> 05:37.466
so I bought Tillie
a fancy new maternity dress...

05:37.567 --> 05:40.127
and took her to the Rainbow Room.

05:40.236 --> 05:43.205
A place as romantic as it was expensive.

05:46.576 --> 05:49.101
How your mama loved to dance!

05:50.713 --> 05:54.809
Maybe I dipped her too hard
or maybe Old Blue Eyes greased the rail.

05:54.917 --> 05:55.906
[Water running]

05:56.018 --> 05:59.920
Next thing I know we're trying to keep you
from making your debut on Broadway.

06:04.293 --> 06:06.887
Three days later
we took a premature bundle of you...

06:06.996 --> 06:08.361
back to Texas.

06:08.464 --> 06:12.457
I never told you because I didn't think
you were man enough to handle it.

06:12.568 --> 06:15.537
Not being born in Texas, you weren't!

06:16.906 --> 06:20.842
Well, thank you, I guess
for not leaving me there.

06:20.943 --> 06:23.343
Don't thank me. Thank your mother.

06:23.479 --> 06:26.346
No. I mean, don't mention anything to her.

06:27.183 --> 06:30.277
She's never forgiven herself
for birthing you outside Texas.

06:30.386 --> 06:32.946
It'd kill her if she knew you found out.

06:33.522 --> 06:35.353
Well, maybe it should.

06:35.892 --> 06:37.519
I don't mean that.

06:44.533 --> 06:48.435
Topsy, remember that thing we said
we were gonna do but never did?

06:49.038 --> 06:52.804
No, we did that.
We did the hell out of that.

06:53.042 --> 06:55.602
I mean that other thing.

06:55.711 --> 06:58.942
I think it's time
we finally completed our mission.

06:59.215 --> 07:03.914
Peggy, being born in New York
makes me no better than Tony Randall.

07:04.053 --> 07:07.545
Now, Hank, if being born here
is so important...

07:07.657 --> 07:09.215
why did you marry me?

07:09.358 --> 07:13.226
I didn't marry you right away.
Believe me, I had to pray on it.

07:13.796 --> 07:17.288
Maybe you should have opened your eyes
and then your Bible, Hank.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.925
"Red and yellow, black and white...

07:20.036 --> 07:22.504
"we are all precious in His sight."

07:22.672 --> 07:24.606
Nothing in there about New York.

07:24.707 --> 07:26.732
Well, Sodom is in there, Hank,
and Gomorrah.

07:26.842 --> 07:29.436
And they are New York as all get out.

07:29.912 --> 07:32.244
- Yep.
- Yep.

07:32.982 --> 07:33.949
Yep.

07:34.083 --> 07:37.143
Or should I say yadda-yadda-yadda?

07:37.887 --> 07:40.253
- Hank, should I?
- Shut up, Dale.

07:40.356 --> 07:43.291
Boy, you New Yorkers really are rude!

07:47.997 --> 07:51.660
Dad, is what Joseph's been telling
everyone at school true?

07:52.034 --> 07:53.968
About where you're from?

07:54.470 --> 07:56.062
I'm sorry, Bobby.

07:57.006 --> 08:00.032
- I'm from New York.
- Get out!

08:00.409 --> 08:03.401
I always knew
I had a little New York in me.

08:03.512 --> 08:05.673
Now I know where it came from.

08:05.781 --> 08:08.341
Did you meet Woody Allen
and hang out in the Village?

08:08.451 --> 08:11.113
I left when I was three days old, okay?

08:11.988 --> 08:14.684
- Ever think about moving back?
- No!

08:23.532 --> 08:25.830
Erwin, get in here and give me a hand.

08:25.935 --> 08:28.563
I ain't getting in no damn hole
until I'm dead.

08:28.671 --> 08:30.002
Never mind.

08:37.913 --> 08:39.676
Kill, Topsy, kill!

08:41.951 --> 08:43.441
COTTON: Look at him go.

08:50.393 --> 08:51.917
Damn it, Dale!

09:02.405 --> 09:05.932
RADIO JOCKEY: This is for the $20
gift certificate to the Arroyo Diner.

09:06.042 --> 09:08.567
Now, what is the name
of the 50-foot-tall cowboy...

09:08.677 --> 09:11.544
that greets visitors
to the Texas State Fair?

09:11.647 --> 09:13.410
That's easy. It's...

09:14.517 --> 09:15.779
Wait a second.

09:15.885 --> 09:17.750
I know this. Dang it!

09:18.054 --> 09:20.784
CALLER: Is it Big Tex?
RADIO JOCKEY: That's right.

09:21.457 --> 09:22.651
Big Tex.

09:22.758 --> 09:24.658
[Car horn blaring]

09:27.530 --> 09:29.259
Go back to New York!

09:33.102 --> 09:34.126
[Hank sighing]

09:34.236 --> 09:37.262
I can't even drive
like a Texan anymore, Peggy.

09:37.706 --> 09:40.903
I think my truck
might be too much vehicle for me.

09:41.377 --> 09:43.538
Dad, come on, you'll be okay.

09:43.779 --> 09:47.078
You just need
what Mom likes to call closure.

09:47.183 --> 09:49.743
I think we should all go to New York.

09:49.985 --> 09:53.182
The only closure I need
is of your mouth, mister.

09:57.159 --> 09:58.251
TILLIE: Hello.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.126
Mom, Dad told me everything.
I know that I was born in New York.

10:02.231 --> 10:05.223
Hank, I'm so, so sorry.

10:05.334 --> 10:08.462
I wanted to say something,
but I didn't want to hurt you.

10:08.571 --> 10:10.630
Don't pretend
you were looking out for me.

10:10.739 --> 10:12.366
You were looking out for you.

10:12.475 --> 10:16.536
You and your romantic getaway
to the Big Rotten Apple.

10:16.712 --> 10:19.806
Wait! Cotton's trying to pin this on me?

10:19.915 --> 10:21.974
It was his idea to go to New York.

10:22.084 --> 10:25.781
What? Well, then one of you
is not telling the truth.

10:28.457 --> 10:29.890
Hell, I know it's him.

10:29.992 --> 10:32.859
Your father dragged me
pregnant to New York.

10:33.028 --> 10:36.259
Then he dragged me to a baseball game
at Yankee Stadium.

10:36.365 --> 10:39.960
TILLIE: It was unseasonably warm that day,
and all I wanted was...

10:40.069 --> 10:41.832
A glass of water?

10:41.937 --> 10:44.599
Suck on a pebble
and keep looking storked out.

10:44.707 --> 10:46.902
You're our ticket through the police line.

10:51.714 --> 10:55.741
COTTON: Well, Fidel, you should have
stayed in Washington...

10:55.851 --> 10:57.876
on your unofficial visit.

10:57.987 --> 11:01.479
Now they're gonna have to carry you
out on a seventh-inning stretcher.

11:01.624 --> 11:02.886
[Tillie groaning]

11:05.427 --> 11:07.725
Woman with fetus coming through!

11:18.107 --> 11:21.338
Have a cigar,
you weak-chinned Cuban son of a bitch!

11:23.646 --> 11:25.045
[Tillie screaming in pain]

11:27.016 --> 11:28.244
Get down!

11:28.651 --> 11:30.050
The baby's coming!

11:30.152 --> 11:33.212
No, not now, woman. Hold it in.

11:34.390 --> 11:37.518
- Go!
- You're running for two, woman.

11:37.793 --> 11:39.021
Let's go!

11:44.366 --> 11:45.924
[Baby Hank crying]

11:46.669 --> 11:50.696
I was born in the ladies' room
at Yankee Stadium?

11:55.778 --> 11:56.767
And at midnight...

11:56.879 --> 12:00.440
we rendezvous in San Antonio
with one Jorge Lopez.

12:00.816 --> 12:03.649
As you know,
he's half Mexican, half Cuban.

12:05.054 --> 12:08.319
For this job,
we'll be using the half that's Cuban.

12:08.424 --> 12:12.758
How are we gonna get to San Antonio?
We can't all fit in your Cadillac car.

12:13.028 --> 12:15.861
I guess I could take a few people
in my Cadillac car...

12:15.965 --> 12:17.364
but I don't wanna.

12:17.466 --> 12:19.934
You idiot. We can't use our own cars.

12:20.035 --> 12:23.232
Remember how the cops tracked
you down when you hit that fire hydrant?

12:23.339 --> 12:26.137
We're hitting
more than a fire hydrant this time!

12:26.242 --> 12:29.439
I know the truth, Dad.
Mom told me everything.

12:29.545 --> 12:34.073
The ladies' room, Yankee Stadium,
Mr. Fidel Castro.

12:34.950 --> 12:36.781
So, the pig squealed?

12:37.620 --> 12:41.215
Well, I guess I can't blame her.
That's what pigs do.

12:41.357 --> 12:45.657
It's your fault I was born in New York
and I can't drive my truck...

12:45.761 --> 12:48.423
and I tried a bagel and I actually liked it.

12:48.530 --> 12:49.963
His truck.

12:50.366 --> 12:54.200
No, no more lies. I loved that bagel.

12:54.470 --> 12:55.801
Go to hell!

12:57.606 --> 12:59.301
But I am in hell.

12:59.408 --> 13:01.376
I spent these last 40 years...

13:01.477 --> 13:04.640
tearing myself up for letting my first son...

13:04.747 --> 13:06.715
be born outside Texas.

13:07.683 --> 13:11.175
- Are you apologizing?
- I think you deserve one.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.787
If I could just shove you back
in your mother...

13:14.890 --> 13:17.757
and do it all over again in Texas, I would.

13:20.996 --> 13:22.020
Dad!

13:22.131 --> 13:25.032
Tell you what, Hank,
let me make it up to you.

13:25.134 --> 13:29.730
We'll go out tonight, raise some hell.
We'll make you one of us, a real Texan.

13:30.239 --> 13:33.731
And we can all goes in your truck.

13:35.044 --> 13:38.912
Come on, Hank.
All I'm asking for is a second chance.

13:43.185 --> 13:45.915
Well, a real Texas man's night out.

13:46.455 --> 13:51.290
- That's just what I needed, I tell you what.
- Sure. Just give me the keys.

13:59.301 --> 14:02.168
You know, this is the first time
we've gone shooting together...

14:02.271 --> 14:04.330
that you haven't humiliated me.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.964
I'm having a ball.

14:06.075 --> 14:08.703
That's nice. Now, give me the gun.

14:19.288 --> 14:20.619
We still gots to gets...

14:20.723 --> 14:22.816
to San Antonio by midnight
and pick up Lopez.

14:22.925 --> 14:25.792
- Now, who's Lopez?
- Yeah, well...

14:26.762 --> 14:31.165
How's this? Lopez's is
the best barbecue take-out in the state.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.601
Yeah, and this here, too.

14:35.571 --> 14:39.007
Boy, that's a lot of knives and flares
and stuff for...

14:40.342 --> 14:41.809
what, exactly?

14:42.211 --> 14:43.337
That's right.

14:43.445 --> 14:47.176
You go into Lopez's dressed
like a commando, you get half off.

14:47.349 --> 14:49.112
Barbecue at midnight?

14:49.518 --> 14:51.008
[Chuckling]

14:51.453 --> 14:53.944
Good luck finding that in Manhattan.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.459
There's another Texas plate.
Hank, take a drink.

15:03.298 --> 15:06.631
I'd just like to tell Buck Strickland
to kiss off.

15:06.869 --> 15:08.393
The Alamo!

15:09.738 --> 15:13.936
Oh, my goodness!
The cradle of Texas liberty.

15:14.042 --> 15:18.240
Hank, every Texan ought to have
his picture taken in front of the Alamo.

15:23.819 --> 15:25.480
Would you be in it with me, Dad?

15:25.587 --> 15:30.024
No, but I'll let you hold today's newspaper
and Topsy's gun.

15:30.559 --> 15:32.789
Make you look like a real Texan.

15:32.895 --> 15:35.420
Now what does a newspaper have to...

15:43.605 --> 15:46.870
It took you long enough, Slowpez.

15:47.209 --> 15:50.701
- That's Lopez?
- He knows too much.

15:51.013 --> 15:52.071
Huh?

15:53.215 --> 15:55.843
Hank, close your eyes
and put out your hands.

15:55.951 --> 15:58.283
Time for a real Texas surprise.

15:58.554 --> 16:00.317
Topsy, get the rope.

16:01.790 --> 16:04.258
Okay, now I do know too much.

16:04.726 --> 16:07.126
You got me a genuine Texas lasso...

16:07.229 --> 16:09.789
like I wanted for my ninth birthday, right?

16:09.898 --> 16:13.698
I tell you, Dad, just when I think
I've got you figured out...

16:13.802 --> 16:16.600
Hey, this isn't a lasso, it's clothesline.

16:17.272 --> 16:20.435
For a New Yorker
you ain't got much street smarts.

16:20.876 --> 16:25.472
I'm not a New Yorker.
I became a Texan when I ate the worm.

16:26.348 --> 16:28.908
You didn't chew it. And you ain't a Texan.

16:29.017 --> 16:31.611
- You're a patsy from New York.
- Patsy?

16:31.854 --> 16:36.086
But the point of this whole trip
was to leave me drunk and Texan.

16:36.291 --> 16:40.887
The point of tonight is to kill Castro,
and bring back his chin pelt.

16:40.996 --> 16:43.191
What about making me a Texan? Wait.

16:43.732 --> 16:46.326
All this was about trying to frame me?

16:46.668 --> 16:50.570
You won't fry for it.
We're just covering our own tracks.

16:50.706 --> 16:53.971
Who'd believe
you'd be man enough to kill Castro?

16:54.176 --> 16:56.474
Dad, you can't kill Castro.

16:56.578 --> 16:59.706
For God's sake, you're not even supposed
to drive at night.

16:59.815 --> 17:02.283
Now, untie me. The game is over.

17:02.384 --> 17:06.411
Lopez, take his clothes.
Stinky, throw him over the fence.

17:13.996 --> 17:16.556
41 years old and I didn't see it coming.

17:16.665 --> 17:17.996
[Man whooping]

17:18.099 --> 17:19.761
MAN: Nice socks!

17:20.301 --> 17:22.270
I've got to hide my nudity.

17:39.721 --> 17:42.451
Hello? Anyone here?

17:48.764 --> 17:50.061
What the...

17:54.403 --> 17:56.030
"These 32 flags...

17:56.138 --> 17:59.107
"honor the birthplaces
of the Alamo defenders.

17:59.841 --> 18:03.834
"Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, New York."

18:04.713 --> 18:05.941
New York?

18:12.754 --> 18:16.281
"They were born across America
but they died Texas heroes."

18:16.491 --> 18:17.788
[Rustling]

18:18.093 --> 18:19.219
Hello?

18:25.434 --> 18:28.892
Jim Bowie and his knife. Easy now.

18:34.242 --> 18:36.506
Sorry about this, Mr. Crockett.

18:37.713 --> 18:39.681
Why am I wearing the hat?

18:44.486 --> 18:46.784
Thanks for the lift.
I don't normally hitchhike.

18:46.888 --> 18:47.912
Hey!

18:49.524 --> 18:52.459
- Keep moving.
- Yeah. Hold on.

18:55.130 --> 18:59.692
- It's starting to drizzle.
- Suck it up, Stinky.

18:59.801 --> 19:02.429
It rained for 17 days straight
at Guadalcanal.

19:02.537 --> 19:05.165
- Didn't hear you complain then.
- I complained a lot.

19:05.273 --> 19:06.331
HANK: Stop!

19:06.942 --> 19:09.103
It's Little Miss New York.

19:10.579 --> 19:11.705
That's enough, Dad.

19:11.813 --> 19:14.611
I may be your son, I can't change that...

19:14.716 --> 19:17.207
but I'm not about to be your patsy.

19:17.653 --> 19:21.145
Well, I suppose you're... Sucker punch.

19:22.658 --> 19:26.059
You don't have what it takes to stop me.
Do it, Topsy.

19:28.797 --> 19:30.287
Old-guy breath.

19:34.169 --> 19:35.966
All right. Prepare to cast off.

19:36.071 --> 19:39.404
First we got to figure out
the direction of the wind.

19:43.512 --> 19:45.104
Who's got saliva?

19:45.781 --> 19:48.249
You know, Colonel,
your boy should have come up by now.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.750
Even Topsy can't hold his breath that long.

19:50.852 --> 19:54.754
What? All right.
Stinky, you'd better get him.

20:01.096 --> 20:03.860
No, don't shoot him!
Jump in and save him!

20:06.835 --> 20:08.826
All right, Dad, it's over.

20:10.072 --> 20:13.564
I've got your spark plugs,
so you're not going anywhere.

20:13.842 --> 20:16.777
We don't need spark plugs.
We'll row to Cuba.

20:18.613 --> 20:20.877
Well, that's how they get here.

20:22.250 --> 20:26.983
I have a doctor's appointment.
I got adult-onset diabetes.

20:27.289 --> 20:30.349
If I don't watch my weight,
they're gonna cut off my foot.

20:30.459 --> 20:32.154
Christ, I'm hungry.

20:33.428 --> 20:35.794
And it's puzzle day at the rec center.

20:35.897 --> 20:38.388
I'm gonna finish
that son of a bitch lighthouse.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.936
Fine, you sissy girls, I'll do the job myself.

20:42.037 --> 20:45.768
Hell, I'll swim to Cuba
with this wrench between my teeth.

20:45.874 --> 20:49.435
Then I'll pose
as a beautiful female plumber.

20:49.544 --> 20:53.173
And then when a toilet clogs
in the presidential palace...

20:53.749 --> 20:54.943
I'll...

20:57.786 --> 20:59.344
[Cotton groaning]

21:00.055 --> 21:02.455
I just wanted to kill Castro.

21:04.359 --> 21:06.054
I know, Dad. I know.

21:09.164 --> 21:13.100
Hank, thanks again for calling.
We were starting to get worried.

21:13.435 --> 21:16.871
- Take your hands off me, you gutter slut.
- Daddy.

21:17.539 --> 21:21.066
Hank, informed sources tell me
that you were dead in the water...

21:21.176 --> 21:23.110
and then you came back to life.

21:23.211 --> 21:28.046
So you were reborn in Texas
which means you are now a native Texan.

21:29.184 --> 21:33.052
No, I'm not a native Texan,
I'm just a Texan.

21:33.755 --> 21:35.586
And I am a Texan, too.

21:36.057 --> 21:39.493
I don't remember seeing
any Montana flag at the Alamo.

21:39.594 --> 21:41.221
Well, it wasn't a state yet.

21:41.363 --> 21:45.697
Fine. Everybody's a Texan.
Change planes in Dallas, you're a Texan.

22:23.138 --> 22:25.834
COTTON: Well, I suppose... Sucker punch.
