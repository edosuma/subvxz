WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.470
( bell rings )

00:02.503 --> 00:05.106
Last week, on Numb3rs--

00:05.139 --> 00:06.040
No real witnesses.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.209
Broad daylight here
and no one saw a thing?

00:08.242 --> 00:09.743
- Agent Eppes?
- Yeah, Liz Warner, right?

00:09.777 --> 00:12.446
Don was my tactical training
instructor up at Quantico.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.615
All right Agent in Charge, come
here. What do you got?

00:14.648 --> 00:17.085
Looks like Tabakian
was paying for drugs

00:17.118 --> 00:19.620
by fixing races and laundering
money at the same time.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.789
Two overdoses,
a fatal hit and run--

00:21.822 --> 00:23.524
Tabakian's got to be
behind this.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.094
Last time we were this close,
he killed my witness.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.062
Ivan Tabakian? FBI.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.263
Got a warrant for your arrest.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.231
Hey!

00:30.264 --> 00:32.366
This time we got a witness
you can't touch.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.701
I just heard some things
about you

00:33.734 --> 00:35.269
and a certain federal
prosecutor?

00:35.303 --> 00:36.770
Did you?

00:36.804 --> 00:38.506
Don Eppes with the same woman
for more than a week--

00:38.539 --> 00:39.707
I don't know, some might
call it progress.

00:39.740 --> 00:43.444
Depends who you ask, right?

00:45.446 --> 00:49.517
(pounding techno music plays)

01:01.529 --> 01:05.599
* A wonderful place to be

01:05.633 --> 01:08.869
* The birds are singing

01:08.902 --> 01:12.506
* Dreams that are sent to me

01:12.540 --> 01:15.576
* Everyone's waving...

01:17.678 --> 01:19.347
I owe you, Eppes.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.648
Ahh...

01:20.681 --> 01:21.882
You saved my night

01:21.915 --> 01:24.585
from being a total disaster.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.753
Hey, look, I don't see how

01:25.786 --> 01:28.589
anyone could stand you up
anyway.

01:28.622 --> 01:32.160
Will you keep this
between you and me?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.428
Word gets out I use an
Internet dating service,

01:34.462 --> 01:37.198
I'm going to take
some serious crap.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.832
Yeah? I don't know,

01:38.866 --> 01:41.435
I'm having a hard time
imagining that.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.836
Take away my badge

01:42.870 --> 01:45.573
and gun, I'm just like
anybody else.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.275
Course, you try
and take it away,

01:47.308 --> 01:48.342
I'm likely
to kill you.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.244
See? That's my point.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.612
* Up here in the sky

01:51.645 --> 01:53.281
Thanks for dinner.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.917
* A beautiful place to be

01:56.950 --> 02:00.388
* So I don't know why

02:00.421 --> 02:03.591
* You're telling me something

02:03.624 --> 02:06.427
You sure you
want to do this?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.562
You've got this
whole settled life.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.331
This prosecutor
girlfriend.

02:10.364 --> 02:13.767
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

02:13.801 --> 02:18.506
* So ready to see you

02:20.908 --> 02:26.214
* So ready to see you

02:28.316 --> 02:33.621
* So ready to see you

02:35.923 --> 02:41.329
* So ready to see you...

02:47.601 --> 02:50.271
(cell phone rings)

02:52.973 --> 02:54.775
Hey.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.445
Nah, it's going to be late.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.581
I don't know how late.
Just late.

03:01.949 --> 03:02.416
(crackling)

03:02.450 --> 03:03.817
(wrench clatters)

03:07.521 --> 03:10.591
Hey, uh... no, it's fine.
It's nothing.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.759
I just dropped the phone.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.261
That's all.
But I need to go.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.762
All right?
Don't wait up.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.531
(tires screeching)

03:29.277 --> 03:34.948
* So ready to see you

03:36.817 --> 03:40.654
* So ready to see you...

03:40.688 --> 03:41.655
(phone rings)

03:41.689 --> 03:42.656
Mine or yours?

03:42.690 --> 03:43.657
(ringing continues)

03:43.691 --> 03:46.627
* So ready to see you...

03:46.660 --> 03:48.429
It's mine.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.830
(sighs)

03:51.999 --> 03:54.902
Yeah, Eppes.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.371
Yeah.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.872
All right.
I'm on my way.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.040
(hangs up)

04:00.073 --> 04:03.911
You got my clothes off,
and now you're going to leave?

04:03.944 --> 04:05.946
Yeah, someone blew up
a power plant.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.648
Homeland's
involved, and...

04:07.681 --> 04:10.418
What do you think?
Should I come back?

04:10.451 --> 04:12.453
Nah, I have to get up early.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.855
You have to get up early, huh?

04:14.888 --> 04:15.689
How early?

04:15.723 --> 04:19.460
I'm locking the doors
at midnight.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.462
All right.

04:21.495 --> 04:25.599
*

04:25.633 --> 04:27.335
Just got the
all-clear from LAFD.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.336
Mm-hmm.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.871
Power company's taken
the station off-line.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.441
Don, if this is terrorism,
it's pretty low-end.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.776
A few thousand customers
spend the night in the dark.

04:35.809 --> 04:40.013
Or it could be a test run,
you know, for a bigger attack.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.850
DAVID: This is the worker right
here. Doing routine maintenance.

04:42.883 --> 04:43.951
And the driver?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.854
Must have gotten out
before the fire and taken off.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.924
(indistinct voices)

04:50.958 --> 04:52.593
Hey, check this out.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.733
DAVID: Somebody jammed a 2X4
in the gas pedal?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.769
Yeah, looked like it was wedged
in there pretty tight.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.539
So, there was no driver.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.944
Hey, guys, thanks for
staying late. Sorry.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.381
That's cool,
I could use the overtime.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.383
We don't get
overtime, Granger.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.452
Yeah, I know, and it's a shame,
'cause I could really use it.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.989
Anyway, here's what we got
on the victim, Randy Syles.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.124
31 years old, he's
married with two kids.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.960
How long's he been with
the power company?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.562
Well, he's not,
actually, not officially.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.431
This substation is owned by
Renault Energy,

05:30.464 --> 05:32.400
and they're in the middle of a
labor dispute.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.535
The union's been on
strike for six weeks.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.769
So, he's a scab?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.771
Union workers must
have loved that.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.040
There's your motive.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.476
Have a printout on the truck
that was used.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.077
It's not going to
help us much, though.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.479
Stolen.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.480
DAVID: Yeah, early this
afternoon.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.648
Echo Park area.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.082
MEGAN;
Echo Park?

05:49.116 --> 05:50.618
That's really far
from the crime scene.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.752
So, this guy steals

05:51.785 --> 05:54.788
a car, drives it 20 miles and
into a power station?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.590
How-How's he get home?

05:56.624 --> 05:57.858
Means we're looking for
multiple suspects.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.794
Yeah, we're gonna need to get a
list of the local union members.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.631
Yes, and cross-reference it
against addresses in Echo Park.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.434
Yeah, I'll check with Homeland,
see if they're picking up

06:06.467 --> 06:09.537
any terrorist chatter that
is related, you know?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.543
You got
somewhere to be?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.810
Not anymore.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.880
You got this wire
coiled too tight.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.582
No, it's not too tight.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.716
- It's wrapped too tight.
- You didn't leave enough--

06:22.750 --> 06:24.652
- Don't touch it, okay?
- Hey, play nice!

06:24.685 --> 06:26.754
Hey, if you two are
gonna fight over your

06:26.787 --> 06:28.689
toys, I'll have to
take 'em away.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.790
CHARLIE: This is not
a toy, Dad.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.025
This is an
electrostatic lifter.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.463
How does that work?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.830
Well, there's some serious
disagreement about that,

06:36.864 --> 06:38.098
whether it's
Biefeld-Brown effect,

06:38.131 --> 06:39.833
ionization of
the corona wires,

06:39.867 --> 06:40.868
simple dielectrophoresis.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.069
ALAN:
Boy, I'd hate

06:42.102 --> 06:43.804
to be in the room
during that debate.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.106
You laugh, but it's
a heated issue.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.576
Okay, let's see what happens
when we apply a little current.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.545
(buzzing)

06:51.579 --> 06:53.080
Wow!

06:53.113 --> 06:55.048
That is amazing!

06:55.082 --> 06:56.917
Well, unless you can do that
with my car,

06:56.950 --> 06:59.953
I still say it's a toy.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.021
DON:
Hey!

07:01.054 --> 07:02.756
What's with all the candles?

07:02.790 --> 07:04.858
You guys didn't lose power,
did you?

07:04.892 --> 07:06.827
Yeah, it was out
just a few hours ago.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.597
Someone blew up a substation
down in Mission Hills.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.732
ALAN: Mission Hills?
How in the world

07:11.765 --> 07:14.234
would we be affected by
something so far away?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.869
It's called a precautionary
broad-line reduction.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.204
The operator simply
shuts the power off

07:17.237 --> 07:19.707
till they can
restore balance.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.675
Right, the thing you have to
remember about electricity--

07:21.709 --> 07:24.244
it can't easily be stored, so
generally, it has to be consumed

07:24.277 --> 07:26.880
within milliseconds
of being produced.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.716
LARRY: Yeah, which means
for the power companies,

07:28.749 --> 07:30.250
it's a constant
game of balance

07:30.283 --> 07:32.520
between electricity production
and consumption.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.655
CHARLIE: So, when this
substation in Mission Hills

07:34.688 --> 07:37.625
failed, then there would have
been a surge in other areas.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.160
ALAN: So, the operators shut
down all the large areas

07:40.193 --> 07:41.161
until the balance is restored,
right?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.730
Right.
DON: What happens

07:42.763 --> 07:44.264
if they don't do that, Larry?

07:44.297 --> 07:47.167
Worst case scenario,
cascading failure.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.670
CHARLIE: It's just like
that game, Jenga.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.972
You know, the game with the
tower of wooden blocks.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.141
Except in this case, the
substations are just like

07:54.174 --> 07:55.408
the individual blocks.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.178
Many of the blocks can be
removed without having

07:58.211 --> 08:02.149
a great effect on the entire
system as a whole.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.685
However, if the wrong block--
or in this case, substation--

08:04.718 --> 08:07.688
is knocked out, well, then...
then yeah, the whole system

08:07.721 --> 08:09.623
could come crashing down.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.191
What, like the-the huge blackout
back East,

08:11.224 --> 08:13.026
a couple, what, three years ago?

08:13.060 --> 08:15.796
Right, 50 million people
left in the dark

08:15.829 --> 08:17.665
because of the failure
of a single switch.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.667
ALAN: You think someone
who did this tonight

08:19.700 --> 08:21.134
had something like
that in mind?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.169
LARRY: Well, if so,

08:22.202 --> 08:24.872
I can't imagine
we've heard the last of them.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.084
WOMAN:
I talked to him on the phone

08:37.117 --> 08:39.753
just minutes before it happened.

08:39.787 --> 08:43.691
He was there, you know,
and then... suddenly he's not.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.696
Maybe you should have a seat.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.198
I'm sorry.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.633
I'm acting like
a crazy person.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.005
I can't believe he's dead.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.773
Mrs. Syles, we know
your husband only worked

08:59.807 --> 09:01.041
for Renault for a short time.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.810
Since the strike.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.345
The pay was so much better
than his usual job.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.214
But do you have any idea
if he received

09:07.247 --> 09:08.649
any threats for crossing

09:08.682 --> 09:10.884
picket lines?

09:10.918 --> 09:13.086
He tried to keep it
from me, but...

09:13.120 --> 09:15.623
he got calls.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.924
I know he did.

09:16.957 --> 09:20.894
That's why he started
working at night.

09:20.928 --> 09:25.098
Figured he'd have less chance
of running into trouble.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.867
You really think that someone
killed him

09:26.900 --> 09:28.101
for trying to earn a living?

09:28.135 --> 09:30.203
MEGAN:
We're not sure yet.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.139
You know, emotions run really
high during a strike.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.241
People think their livelihoods
are in danger.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.644
Someone had to do the work.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.746
Otherwise, people would be in
the dark.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.614
Like the station
that failed

09:40.648 --> 09:42.315
two nights ago
wasn't one of Robbie's.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.385
He said that was
just poor maintenance.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.189
A substation failed
two days ago?

09:49.222 --> 09:51.591
Boyle Heights.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.228
The night before last,
Renault Energy had

09:55.262 --> 09:56.396
another substation
go down.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.330
No way.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.366
No, and they blamed it
on wear and tear.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.433
Because of the strike,

10:00.467 --> 10:02.670
they can't keep up with the
maintenance program.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.705
All right, well, it ain't a
coincidence, then.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.740
Why not? I mean,
coincidences, after all,

10:06.774 --> 10:08.976
are an absolutely valid
mathematical occurrence.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.044
Two failures in two nights,
I mean, they're related.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.246
And if they are,
then Randy Syles wasn't

10:13.280 --> 10:15.015
the target last night.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.283
So... they're after substations?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.285
It doesn't rule out
the striking workers,

10:18.318 --> 10:21.054
because every blackout is
bad PR for the energy companies.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.255
DON: I don't care about

10:22.289 --> 10:24.191
the PR; I'm worried they're
gonna crash the entire grid.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.192
Right?

10:25.225 --> 10:26.359
Cascading failure.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.795
Yeah, but wouldn't they
need to knock out

10:27.828 --> 10:29.663
every substation to do that?

10:29.697 --> 10:30.263
No, just the right one.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.232
Look, if a
cascading

10:32.265 --> 10:34.835
failure is what they're after,
then yes, I-I may be able

10:34.868 --> 10:37.204
to predict where the
next attack will come from.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.171
Yeah? How do you do that?

10:38.205 --> 10:40.741
Load flow analysis.
Just get me the usage

10:40.774 --> 10:43.143
and current flow figures
from the power company.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.445
- I can do that.
- And then a load flow analysis

10:45.478 --> 10:47.948
could tell us which substations
are most critical--

10:47.981 --> 10:50.317
the ones that are most
likely to be the next target.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.285
All right, we'll get
you what you need.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.890
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.227
Hey.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.194
What's up?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.364
You left these last night.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.233
Ah...

11:06.266 --> 11:07.835
Hey, that was fun.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.069
Yeah.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.805
Hey, I'm sorry...

11:11.839 --> 11:12.973
No, you don't have to explain.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.776
No, no, no, we ended up going
way past midnight, so...

11:15.809 --> 11:16.944
I mean...

11:16.977 --> 11:18.912
I appreciate it, but
I really did

11:18.946 --> 11:20.347
just come by to
return the glasses.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.348
Oh?

11:21.381 --> 11:23.250
I've got a
meeting upstairs.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.484
Now, really.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.485
It's cool.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.454
All right, thanks.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.890
Don't get me wrong, Eppes.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.859
I wouldn't say no
to a rain check.

11:31.892 --> 11:35.996
All right, well, I'll keep
my eye on the weather.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.430
- See you later.
- Yeah.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.236
That was a quick visit.

11:43.270 --> 11:46.706
Yeah, she, uh... just had my
glasses, so...

11:48.909 --> 11:50.944
Is everything all right
with you and Robin?

11:50.978 --> 11:54.281
Yeah. I got to get
Renault Energy on the phone.

11:58.151 --> 12:02.355
(crackling buzz)

12:02.389 --> 12:04.457
Look at how much energy
we actually consume.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.459
This is amazing.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.228
Yeah, and how much
paperwork goes with it.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.130
This is staggering.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.498
I didn't know you guys were
still here.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.800
What are you doing?

12:12.833 --> 12:13.700
CHARLIE:
We're trying to

12:13.733 --> 12:14.868
determine which
substation we'd attack

12:14.902 --> 12:17.204
if we wanted to black out
most of Southern California.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.371
Please don't
tell me

12:18.405 --> 12:19.807
this is something for
Senior Ditch Day.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.208
It's Don.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.076
LARRY: Hey, did I
never tell you two

12:23.110 --> 12:24.377
how one year in graduate school

12:24.411 --> 12:27.147
I attempted to live
without electricity?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.316
They had electricity when
you were in graduate school?

12:29.349 --> 12:30.450
LARRY:
Yeah.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.921
Yeah, and thank you
for that, Charles.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.223
Why would you want
to go without power?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.391
Was this some Thoreau's

12:38.425 --> 12:40.360
Walden Pond phase
or something?

12:40.393 --> 12:43.230
No, it had to do with
some girl I was dating.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.432
Sandra Darwinkle--
yes, that was

12:45.465 --> 12:47.167
her real name.
Anyway, this is

12:47.200 --> 12:49.536
back a ways. This is back during
the energy crisis.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.603
The first one.

12:50.637 --> 12:54.007
LARRY: And again,
I thank you for that, Charles.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.810
Anyway, she thought that if she
and I went off grid

12:56.844 --> 12:59.346
that it might make
a political statement.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.981
And of course, I was just
thinking

13:01.014 --> 13:02.315
it might get me...

13:02.349 --> 13:03.316
Lucky?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.452
Eh... crudely put, but yes.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.187
Did you?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.389
Well, there is, of course,

13:09.422 --> 13:11.091
my obsession with
dental hygiene.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.860
CHARLIE:
She caught you

13:12.893 --> 13:14.394
with your electric
toothbrush, didn't she?

13:14.427 --> 13:15.996
Uh, the Waterpik, yeah.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.397
But with the same result.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.099
Anyway, thus ended
my relationship

13:19.132 --> 13:21.334
with Sandra Darwinkle.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.403
CHARLIE: All rightie, you know
what? I think I have it.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.940
So if I wanted to cause
a cascading failure, then

13:26.974 --> 13:29.576
this is the substation
that I would

13:29.609 --> 13:31.344
attack.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.954
Anything?

13:42.389 --> 13:43.456
No.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.425
Maybe Charlie's wrong.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.895
There's no activity at
this power station.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.565
DAVID:
Math says this is the spot.

13:52.599 --> 13:57.070
Hey, you think Megan ever comes
up here with Fleinhardt?

13:57.104 --> 13:58.171
Oh, come on.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.473
When you gonna give that whole
thing a rest, dude?

14:00.507 --> 14:01.608
I'm just saying,

14:01.641 --> 14:04.511
that guy's into his classic car,
he doesn't have anywhere

14:04.544 --> 14:07.280
to live, leaves him with pretty
severely limited options.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.016
You are obsessed, man.
That is crazy.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.617
Why is it so hard
for you to

14:10.650 --> 14:13.020
get it through your head that
those two like each other?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.421
Come on, you're telling me you
don't think that

14:14.454 --> 14:16.089
that's just the slightest bit
weird?

14:16.123 --> 14:18.391
I don't think about it.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.994
Seriously?

14:21.028 --> 14:23.063
Seriously.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.268
(electrical zapping)

14:28.301 --> 14:29.937
DAVID:
Whoa, look at that.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.072
COLBY: They must've crashed out
another power station.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.173
They hit it.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.316
Not here they didn't.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.452
DAVID:
Then which one did they hit?

14:52.692 --> 14:54.461
How'd they do it?

14:54.494 --> 14:56.363
Looks like they threw a
little piece of rebar

14:56.396 --> 14:57.397
across the transformer grid

14:57.430 --> 14:58.932
and it caused
a short.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.200
That'd bring
the whole thing down?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.268
Oh, absolutely.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.602
Yes, rebar, is it?

15:02.635 --> 15:04.271
- Yeah.
- That's metal.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.973
Highly conductive.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.374
Yeah, that would
provide a pathway

15:07.407 --> 15:09.042
from the high to the low sides.

15:09.076 --> 15:09.909
Get a power surge...

15:09.943 --> 15:12.946
drives the transformers
way beyond their

15:12.980 --> 15:15.048
capacity--
boom.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.549
We were having dinner,

15:16.583 --> 15:19.119
and all the lights
went out.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.487
So?

15:20.520 --> 15:21.621
Don's briefing the mayor.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.991
60,000 customers
lost power tonight.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.960
This is not where Charles and I
predicted they'd strike next.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.728
No, we were staked out
up on Mulholland.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.031
And they hit here instead?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.565
The question
is why.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.134
Think the real question is who.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.735
Our prime suspect group
doesn't make any sense anymore.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.504
The striking workers?

15:37.537 --> 15:40.107
Yeah, this power station is
owned by an independent company.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.375
It has nothing to do
with Renault Energy

15:42.409 --> 15:44.711
or the labor
dispute at all.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.013
So that means that terrorism
moves back

15:46.046 --> 15:47.080
to the number one slot.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.215
MAN:
Agents, LAPD found a body

15:48.248 --> 15:50.317
along the
north perimeter.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.285
- Oh, dear.
- Come on.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.329
The company said they didn't
have anybody on, so

16:02.362 --> 16:03.330
he can't be
a worker.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.431
Then I think we just found
our next suspect.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.766
He must have climbed the fence
to throw the rebar.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.602
Still holding on
when it shorted out.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.771
Electricity-- always looking
for someplace to go.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.008
Jumped to that fence post
as a ground.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.644
And then made use of this
poor gentleman as well.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.048
Got no I.D. on him.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.083
There's no way we're going
to get any prints

16:23.116 --> 16:24.484
off these hands.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.286
- They're way too charred.
- Car keys, cell phone?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.520
Nothing.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.222
Were his pockets turned out
like that when you found him?

16:29.256 --> 16:31.391
Yeah. I didn't touch anything.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.393
Somebody went through
his pockets?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.128
I'm guessing whoever
he was working with

16:35.162 --> 16:37.597
cleaned him out to make sure
we couldn't I.D. him.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.233
What's this on his neck?

16:40.267 --> 16:42.269
It's a prison tattoo.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.704
"4-B-27."

16:44.737 --> 16:46.539
Cell block in Chino.
He did time there.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.341
Well, then let's get
his photo,

16:48.375 --> 16:51.078
and we'll fax it over and see
if anyone recognizes him.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.147
Alejandro Munoz-- he's a
Salvadorian national

16:54.181 --> 16:56.216
released from Chino
about six months ago

16:56.249 --> 16:58.251
after serving a four-year
stint for dealing drugs.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.652
Any ties to terrorist
organizations?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.454
Still checking.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.190
All right, so Charlie,
explain to me

17:03.223 --> 17:05.225
why the attack happened
in Silver Lake

17:05.258 --> 17:06.526
and not up on Mulholland.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.628
Well, my guess is we were wrong.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.697
See, we assumed that
the objective was

17:10.730 --> 17:11.864
a cascading failure,
remember?

17:11.898 --> 17:14.534
So you don't think that's
what these guys were after?

17:14.567 --> 17:15.402
No.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.070
So, wrong on

17:17.104 --> 17:18.638
suspect,
wrong on motive.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.141
DAVID: I think I have a line on
Munoz's accomplice.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.742
Cell phone records.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.677
Last three days he traded
more than a dozen calls

17:24.711 --> 17:26.146
with one number.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.548
I traced it back to a guy
named Lyle Donahue.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.750
An electrical engineer, and
former member of the State

17:30.783 --> 17:31.851
Utility Commission.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.086
Former member?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.354
It gets kind of interesting.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.588
He helped stage

17:35.622 --> 17:37.857
a phony power shortage
back in 2001.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.659
Made a fortune when
the prices shot up.

17:39.692 --> 17:40.593
He was caught.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.163
It's called utility price
manipulation.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.364
Served two
and a half years.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.799
- In Chino, same as Munoz.
- Yeah.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.437
So all of this has to have some
effect on utility prices, right?

17:50.470 --> 17:51.804
COLBY:
So you think Lyle Donahue

17:51.838 --> 17:52.905
is back to his old game?

17:52.939 --> 17:55.375
Makes sense. He's not a player
anymore. Maybe he's

17:55.408 --> 17:57.610
found a new way to
manipulate the power market.

17:57.644 --> 17:58.878
By crashing substations.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.247
COLBY:
Or hiring old

18:00.280 --> 18:01.714
prison acquaintances
to do it for him.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.483
DON: All right, well, let's get
this guy Donahue

18:03.516 --> 18:05.185
in here. Set up his phone,
his house,

18:05.218 --> 18:06.686
credit cards,
the whole nine yards.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.560
Hey, Charlie.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.427
Hey.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.597
I was thinking
about you last night.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.432
Is that right?

18:19.466 --> 18:22.135
I was preparing a lecture.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.903
And I found
an interesting article

18:23.936 --> 18:26.406
on synapse reflexivity.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.708
I thought you might fit it into
your cognitive emergence theory.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.178
Oh, thanks.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.513
Another load flow analysis?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.915
Yeah. The FBI has
a new suspect.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.450
Former utilities commissioner.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.253
I guess they think that
the attacks are an attempt

18:40.287 --> 18:42.755
to influence utility prices.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.157
The outages cause

18:44.191 --> 18:46.159
spot fluctuation
in the demand market.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.195
So I guess if you made
the right investments

18:48.228 --> 18:50.363
and you hit the right targets,
you could do pretty well.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.865
If you hit the right targets,
you could do very well.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.367
These guys aren't hitting
the right targets.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.203
What do you mean?

18:56.236 --> 18:59.872
Well, if you really want to
influence utility prices,

18:59.906 --> 19:02.209
there are so many other
substations to go after

19:02.242 --> 19:04.177
that would have greater impact.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.346
Then what's all
this about?

19:06.379 --> 19:08.315
I don't know. Who knows, right?

19:08.348 --> 19:10.317
accomplishedthey've really

19:10.350 --> 19:11.651
is a few
localized blackouts.

19:11.684 --> 19:16.456
Charlie, the focus so far
has been on the global

19:16.489 --> 19:18.491
systemic objective.
First the cascading failure,

19:18.525 --> 19:20.193
now market manipulation.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.461
Yep, that's right.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.895
Well, you're treating
the outages

19:22.929 --> 19:24.864
as if they're
a secondary by-product.

19:24.897 --> 19:28.301
And what if they aren't
a by-product?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.602
What if they're
the objective?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.170
What if?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.408
Hey, Donny, I didn't
even know you were here.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.644
Yeah, I left this here
the other night.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.413
So, uh, you think you're going
to be around for dinner tonight?

19:40.447 --> 19:41.714
Or do you already have plans

19:41.748 --> 19:43.550
with Robin?

19:43.583 --> 19:44.784
No plans.

19:44.817 --> 19:45.852
Really?

19:45.885 --> 19:48.388
I could have sworn I remember

19:48.421 --> 19:51.424
you talking about a concert,
but, um...

19:51.458 --> 19:53.760
So how are things going
with you two, huh?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.396
They're fine.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.665
Fine?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.467
What is it, we can't
talk about it?

20:00.500 --> 20:03.436
Do I need a security

20:03.470 --> 20:05.372
clearance to get information
about you and Robin?

20:05.405 --> 20:06.339
Dad, what are you doing?

20:06.373 --> 20:08.641
What? I'm not doing anything.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.377
Yeah, your little
interrogation here.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.713
All right, I was talking to
Charlie earlier.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.548
Ah...

20:15.582 --> 20:17.850
And he told me some woman came
around to see you at work.

20:17.884 --> 20:18.785
A woman,
n-not Robin.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.753
And, um, he said it was
fairly obvious that

20:20.787 --> 20:22.789
something was going on
between the two of you.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.491
So?

20:24.524 --> 20:27.327
Donny, uh, do you remember

20:27.360 --> 20:28.728
we were talking about
how you wanted

20:28.761 --> 20:30.897
things to work out
between you and Robin? And...

20:30.930 --> 20:32.365
I mean, you can't have
a relationship

20:32.399 --> 20:33.666
if you're
not gonna commit to it.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.702
Yeah, well, Dad, I'm not
doing this, okay?

20:35.735 --> 20:36.803
I'm not Charlie, and, I...

20:36.836 --> 20:37.937
(phone ringing)

20:39.038 --> 20:40.473
Eppes.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.742
DAVID:
Don-- Lyle Donahue, engineer.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.511
We've been sitting on
his credit cards.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.346
He just used one.
Uh, bar up

20:46.379 --> 20:47.614
on Sunset, corner of Gardner.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.948
All right,
you know what, take it.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.317
Get Megan and hit it.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.784
- We can't wait.
- All right.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.426
I'm doing the best I can.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.594
How? By carrying on
with another girl?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.566
See you later.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.804
Have you seen this guy?
(rock song playing)

21:11.838 --> 21:13.640
I don't think so.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.874
just ran his credit card

21:14.907 --> 21:16.008
less than 20 minutes ago.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.076
What's the name?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.546
Donahue. Lyle Donahue.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.852
Here it is.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.620
Lyle Donahue.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.656
He's not the guy
in the picture.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.523
Kid over there.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.760
He and his buddies
are running a tab.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.567
Got a kid running-- he's
headed for the back door.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.534
COLBY:
All right.

21:42.902 --> 21:43.736
(grunting)

21:43.770 --> 21:46.072
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

21:46.105 --> 21:48.341
Kid, where'd you get
the credit card from?

21:55.582 --> 21:56.816
So which one is it?

21:56.849 --> 21:57.684
It's that one there.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.659
- Oh, boy.
- I didn't do it.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.661
He was that way
when I found him.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.601
It's Donahue.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.769
Single shot
to the back of the ear.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.037
A little too
professional for,

22:18.070 --> 22:19.439
this bozo, don't you think?

22:19.472 --> 22:20.973
MEGAN: Donahue must have
been dead

22:21.007 --> 22:22.675
when he got the credit card.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.412
We all realize that
this means there are

22:25.445 --> 22:27.780
the Salvadorians and Donahue.st

22:27.814 --> 22:30.450
Maybe some other investors
in his little pricing scheme.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.719
Found Munoz, made the connection
to Donahue.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.886
Someone wanted to make sure

22:33.920 --> 22:35.988
we didn't take that
chain any higher.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.824
Yeah, but who is that somebody,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.826
and how high is that
chain going to go?

22:48.735 --> 22:50.703
Hey, we've all been
going in the wrong direction.

22:50.737 --> 22:51.538
All right, Charlie,
just relax.

22:51.571 --> 22:52.905
We just found Donahue,all right?
- Oh!

22:52.939 --> 22:55.007
Did you talk to him?
Did he, did he tell you?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.008
No, Charlie. He's dead.
Somebody shot him.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.143
DON: This is much bigger than
price fixing,

22:57.176 --> 22:57.910
I can tell you that.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.812
I'm sorry, but this

22:59.846 --> 23:01.180
has nothing at all to
do with price-fixing.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.949
What do you think
it has to do with?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.784
I... I don't know, but it's
about the blackouts.

23:04.817 --> 23:05.785
It's about
the blackouts.

23:05.818 --> 23:06.886
I mean, at first
they seem

23:06.919 --> 23:08.855
unrelated and disparate,
but when I looked at them

23:08.888 --> 23:11.524
in the context of set theory,
they had a lot in common,

23:11.558 --> 23:13.926
so just... Just pay attention.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.629
So there have been three
substation attacks.

23:16.663 --> 23:19.065
Each of these caused a blackout
in a particular region.

23:19.098 --> 23:23.536
This is the area hit
by the first blackout,

23:23.570 --> 23:26.573
the Boyle Heights
substation failure.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.676
This is the second, caused by
the outage that killed

23:29.709 --> 23:30.677
that maintenance
worker.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.479
And here's the third.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.481
Okay, so the three
overlap in one area?

23:34.514 --> 23:37.817
Right, to a statistically
significant extent.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.787
All right, so why blackouts
three nights in a row?

23:40.820 --> 23:42.789
Well, that must be
Donahue's objective.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.724
To take
down these blocks.

23:44.757 --> 23:48.628
Okay, so what...? Uh...
Cover up a heist, knock out

23:48.661 --> 23:49.562
a security system...

23:49.596 --> 23:51.664
And there's a lot of
stuff in that area.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.800
There's banks and
brokerage houses,

23:53.833 --> 23:56.102
museums, but I haven't seen
any reports of break-ins.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.737
Charlie,
the thing is,

23:57.770 --> 23:59.506
we're pretty much looking
at most of downtown here.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.873
Is there any way
to be more specific?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.842
This is the best I could
do with what I had.

24:02.875 --> 24:03.776
That's not
all you have.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.679
We just found this pad
in Donahue's car.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.815
And it's filled with
calculations.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.217
These are Dantzig-Wolf
decompositions,

24:11.250 --> 24:12.685
network interdiction
strategies...

24:12.719 --> 24:14.053
It's-It's pretty
high-end stuff.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.622
Can you use any of it
to figure out

24:15.655 --> 24:17.089
where he was gonna try
to black out?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.891
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna need to
take a look at these.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.159
In the meantime, I'll see

24:20.192 --> 24:21.794
who else Donahue
was in bed with.

24:21.828 --> 24:22.695
Maybe that's who murdered him.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.096
Hey. Wait, wait. Listen.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.133
This, this little
conversation you had with Dad.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.636
Oh. Yeah. Um...

24:29.669 --> 24:33.239
Sorry. I just...

24:33.272 --> 24:34.541
No, you're right.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.842
You're right--
I had no right

24:35.875 --> 24:37.577
to tell him about
you and Agent Warner.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.179
Yeah. Exactly.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.114
I don't know. You seemed
to be getting along

24:42.148 --> 24:44.183
real nicely with
Robin, you know, and...

24:44.216 --> 24:49.255
you just seemed
a lot happier.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.657
Well, Charlie, you don't know

24:50.690 --> 24:52.224
what you're talking
about, okay? So,

24:52.258 --> 24:54.861
I mean, I appreciate
the thought, but...

24:54.894 --> 24:55.962
All right?

24:55.995 --> 24:56.963
Sorry.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.297
Thanks. Go ahead, take a look.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.932
Let me know what
you come up with.

24:59.966 --> 25:00.867
Okay.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.305
CHARLIE:
None of the three

25:06.338 --> 25:07.974
substations attacked

25:08.007 --> 25:09.909
directly affect
the downtown area.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.043
You know, they're too far out,

25:11.077 --> 25:13.145
like Boyle Heights and Mission
Hills and Silver Lake.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.046
No, the blackouts

25:14.080 --> 25:15.715
were due to the broad-line
reductions.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.149
The operators just shut
the area down.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.751
Right, right.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.219
So Donahue
did these calculations

25:20.252 --> 25:23.255
in order to predict the
human operator's reaction

25:23.289 --> 25:26.258
to his attacks?
I mean, that's...

25:26.292 --> 25:27.259
that's
so impressive.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.928
Impressive, yes, but it gets us

25:28.961 --> 25:30.997
no closer to discovering
his intended target,

25:31.030 --> 25:32.031
does it?

25:32.064 --> 25:34.601
No. I know. I, I've performed
every particular

25:34.634 --> 25:36.002
permutation I could
possibly perceive of.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.937
I've gone over and over
these three attacks.

25:37.970 --> 25:41.040
I can't narrow it down.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.842
What about the other
substations that

25:42.875 --> 25:44.276
affect downtown?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.646
What about them?
He didn't choose the others.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.215
Yeah, that's precisely
my point-- why not?

25:49.248 --> 25:51.618
Presumably because
they would not

25:51.651 --> 25:55.221
result in a blackout
that included his target.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.256
An exclusionary approach?

25:57.289 --> 25:59.358
Run calculations
on the other substations,

25:59.391 --> 26:00.226
see what area of
downtown is omitted.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.862
Plus, it is
a more powerful approach

26:02.895 --> 26:05.164
than the one you're using.

26:05.197 --> 26:08.134
LIZ: You know what, I'll catch
you later, all right?

26:08.167 --> 26:09.201
I'll catch up with Don.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.336
What do you
say, gents?

26:10.369 --> 26:12.071
How you doing?

26:12.104 --> 26:14.874
What? Downtown two days
in a row, huh? Lucky me.

26:14.907 --> 26:15.742
Forget it, Eppes.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.877
You already blew
your one chance with me.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.112
No way. I thought I
was getting a rain check.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.816
You remember our, um,
drug dealer friend

26:23.850 --> 26:25.017
operating out
of the racetrack?

26:25.051 --> 26:27.053
Yeah. Tabakian?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.354
He's decided
to cooperate

26:28.387 --> 26:29.822
and help us go after

26:29.856 --> 26:31.090
the Salvadorian cartel
that was supplying them.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.760
good get for you, huh? a

26:33.793 --> 26:35.127
Yeah.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.896
Bottom line, Tabakian and I
are gonna be shacking up

26:36.929 --> 26:38.898
in a safe house... in San Diego.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.066
Ha-ha.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.368
While he spills everything
to the U.S. attorney. So...

26:42.401 --> 26:43.870
You know when
you take off?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.905
Today.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.074
I gotta run. We're gonna
process him, but, uh...

26:48.107 --> 26:49.709
I'll call you
when I get back.

26:49.742 --> 26:50.609
Yeah.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.879
I'll make sure it doesn't rain.
(chuckles)

26:54.146 --> 26:56.749
You know, my brother can do
things with math.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.150
It's, uh... he's a genius.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.686
Oh.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.857
Got it.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.126
You narrowed
down the area?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.127
Yeah.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.061
So it turns out,

27:09.095 --> 27:12.231
there are 12 substations
whose failure would

27:12.264 --> 27:15.167
have directly or indirectly
caused a downtown blackout.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.103
Overlaying the boundaries
of the three attacks

27:17.136 --> 27:19.438
gave us an initial target area.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.140
Yeah, but, Charlie,
that area was too big.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.441
- It's too vague.
- No, I know.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.776
Mapping the three blackouts

27:23.810 --> 27:24.744
was just the first step.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.847
The real key was
examining the substations

27:27.880 --> 27:29.415
that Donahue did not attack.

27:29.448 --> 27:32.084
He rejected the nine others
as targets because

27:32.118 --> 27:33.986
the blackouts they would
have caused

27:34.020 --> 27:37.824
didn't include this area.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.926
COLBY: You say this is the area
that he wanted to black out?

27:39.959 --> 27:42.762
'Cause that's only a couple
blocks from here.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.230
It's the J. Edward
Rice Building.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.065
The Rice Building.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.767
Yeah, right. Rice. What?

27:47.800 --> 27:50.236
That's the downtown
Federal Detention Center.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.671
Donahue's choreographing
a prison break.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.380
(indistinct voices)

28:03.816 --> 28:06.018
MAN: I don't really know
how we can take

28:06.052 --> 28:08.220
any more precautions against a
breakout if you can't tell me

28:08.254 --> 28:09.822
which prisoner you're
talking about.

28:09.856 --> 28:10.990
Right. Well,
we're working on that.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.860
As soon as we get the name,
we'll get it to you, okay?

28:13.893 --> 28:14.994
What about the power-
failure scenario

28:15.027 --> 28:16.462
we were
discussing earlier?

28:16.495 --> 28:17.864
Well, there's
no denying it.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.966
Everything here
runs on electricity.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.001
Cells open and
close electronically.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.736
Locks are automated.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.238
We rely heavily on
surveillance cameras.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.440
Yeah, and what happens if
the power gets cut totally?

28:28.474 --> 28:29.909
We're screwed.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.778
45 guards.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.212
2,200 prisoners.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.882
But that's exactly why
the detention center

28:35.915 --> 28:36.749
has a backup system.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.418
We have four 30-
megawatt generators.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.420
Diesel-powered.
Anytime we fall

28:41.453 --> 28:43.890
off the power grid, they
automatically kick in.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.291
Right. And where are they at?

28:45.324 --> 28:47.960
Sub-basement, totally
secure and no inmate access.

28:47.994 --> 28:48.995
DAVID: For the last three nights

28:49.028 --> 28:50.997
during the blackouts were
there any incidents?

28:51.030 --> 28:53.833
Anyone trying to get to the
generators, maybe trying

28:53.866 --> 28:55.001
to disable them?

28:55.034 --> 28:56.903
No. Powered us through,
no problems at all.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.938
Look, if-if, if
these blackouts

28:58.971 --> 29:00.172
are someone trying
to get to us,

29:00.206 --> 29:01.440
they haven't done
their homework.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.910
We're the last place
to feel any effect.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.015
Hi.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.016
You look awfully

29:10.049 --> 29:11.017
contemplative.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.218
Is it pondering

29:12.251 --> 29:14.553
some mystery of the universe?

29:14.586 --> 29:19.158
Hardly. I'm pondering the
Federal Detention Center.

29:19.191 --> 29:22.895
Oh. Charles said you suspect
some possible jailbreak.

29:22.929 --> 29:25.898
Yeah, but there's
2,000 prisoners

29:25.932 --> 29:28.367
and I can't connect
any of them to Donahue.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.302
I don't know who
he was working for.

29:30.336 --> 29:34.206
How do you know Donahue
was working for someone else?

29:34.240 --> 29:36.142
Well, there has
to be someone else.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.543
Someone murdered him.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.812
No, I'm not questioning whether
someone else was involved.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.881
I think that much is a matter
of near certainty.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.850
Okay, now you're
just confusing me.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.484
Well, what I mean to say is...

29:45.517 --> 29:47.053
You see, all along
you've been applying

29:47.086 --> 29:48.554
a kind of bottom-up analysis.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.456
It all started with the
unfortunate gentleman

29:50.489 --> 29:51.590
who was electrocuted.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.425
Alejandro Munoz.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.928
That's right, and then you
worked your way up to Donahue

29:55.962 --> 29:58.397
and now you're working up
to someone above Donahue.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.331
That's standard
procedure.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.467
We're always looking
for the bigger fish.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.970
Yeah, but how do you know
you're even fishing

30:04.003 --> 30:05.404
in the right direction?

30:07.506 --> 30:09.909
You see, in 1959,

30:09.942 --> 30:13.379
Richard Feynman gave
a very famous lecture.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.481
It was called, "There's
Plenty of Room at the Bottom,"

30:15.514 --> 30:18.317
and it altered the thinking of a
whole generation of scientists

30:18.350 --> 30:22.388
because it changed their focus
to thinking smaller and smaller

30:22.421 --> 30:23.389
instead of larger.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.858
Now, see, you've gone
from Munoz to Donahue,

30:25.892 --> 30:28.494
and now you're looking
even farther up the chain.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.262
Perhaps you need to go

30:30.296 --> 30:32.498
in the opposite direction.

30:32.531 --> 30:35.501
You're suggesting that the plan
to blow up the substations

30:35.534 --> 30:37.469
just started with Munoz.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.439
I think it's worthy
of consideration.

30:40.472 --> 30:41.440
You're a genius.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.943
Head of the class.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.112
DON:
Look, the prison is

30:46.145 --> 30:47.579
immune to blackouts.
Hey, guys.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.081
How do you mean, "immune"?

30:49.115 --> 30:50.549
Well, they have
a backup system.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.919
The recent blackouts didn't
even ruffle their feathers.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.454
There's the possibility of
other targets in the area.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.456
Yeah, but I'm not
wrong about the prison.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.459
Charlie, three nights in a row,
the backup generators kicked in

31:00.492 --> 31:01.593
and-and there
was no impact.

31:01.627 --> 31:05.331
Listen, you cannot have
an event in a closed system

31:05.364 --> 31:06.532
without subsequent impact
on that system.

31:06.565 --> 31:07.333
All right.
Impossibility.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.168
Don't go all Isaac
Newton on me.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.904
We'll go take another look
at the map, all right?

31:11.938 --> 31:14.406
Sir Isaac Newton.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.407
Hey.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.943
We just found the link

31:16.976 --> 31:19.045
between the prison
and the blackouts.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.079
Tell me again how I'm wrong.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.413
A link to Donahue?

31:21.447 --> 31:23.115
No, it's Alejandro Munoz.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.117
Turns out Munoz
is Salvadorian.

31:25.151 --> 31:27.419
Has close family ties
to a major drug cartel.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.521
The same cartel
that was supplying the drugs

31:29.555 --> 31:31.223
to Tabakian's operation

31:31.257 --> 31:32.424
at the Southland
Downs racetrack.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.625
Tabakian.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.694
COLBY: Yeah, and he's
currently being held

31:35.727 --> 31:37.596
in the Federal Detention Center.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.365
It's gotta be who they're
trying to break out.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.968
Tabakian had a deal with the
U.S. Attorney to testify against

31:42.001 --> 31:43.002
the Salvadorians.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.136
COLBY: Well, then, maybe the

31:44.170 --> 31:46.072
blackouts were an attempt to
cover a hit, try and get

31:46.105 --> 31:47.239
an inmate close
enough to him

31:47.273 --> 31:48.607
to shank him or something.
DON: No, no.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.176
The guy's in solitary.
I mean, they're not

31:50.209 --> 31:51.677
gonna let anyone near him.
DAVID: And besides,

31:51.710 --> 31:54.080
the blackouts didn't have any
effect on the prison operations.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.448
I don't understand how
they're part of the plan.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.584
Well, the blackouts had to have
had some impact.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.152
We were there. They didn't.

32:00.186 --> 32:02.154
You said the prison
ran their generators

32:02.188 --> 32:03.289
three nights in a row.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.357
How are the
generators fueled?

32:05.391 --> 32:07.259
On diesel, Charlie.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.161
That's a pretty large facility.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.296
They'd have to have burned
through a lot of fuel.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.298
MEGAN: Okay, so what if that
was the plan? The first

32:12.331 --> 32:15.101
three just run the fuel tanks
dry, and the fourth night

32:15.134 --> 32:16.268
they're in the dark.

32:16.302 --> 32:17.536
Yeah, but they're not gonna
just let the tanks go dry.

32:17.569 --> 32:21.073
I mean, they'd just call up and
get an emergency order of fuel.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.009
DON:
It's the truck.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.377
It's the truck. It's-It's an
unscheduled delivery.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.378
DAVID:
Oh, they get

32:26.412 --> 32:27.746
that truck in there,
they will have

32:27.779 --> 32:29.415
a way to break Tabakian out.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.017
Yeah, but wait a minute.
Don just said

32:31.050 --> 32:31.950
that he's testifying
against them.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.419
I mean, why are they
gonna spend the time

32:33.452 --> 32:34.253
coming in to break him out?

32:34.286 --> 32:37.089
Be a lot easier
to just kill him.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.757
They're going after him.
This isn't a break out.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.093
These guys are
trying to break in.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.200
MAN:
Opening Sally port one.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.674
Fuel transport coming in.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.517
Hey, you guys are
right on time.

33:12.591 --> 33:13.325
(silenced shots fire,
man groans)

33:20.299 --> 33:21.700
(buzzer)

33:41.320 --> 33:44.223
Liz Warner, FBI.g?

33:44.256 --> 33:46.225
I'm processing out a prisoner,
Ivan Tabakian.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.700
No weapons allowed inside
the prison, Agent Warner.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.368
You're gonna have
to check that here.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.706
Thank you.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.320
I can't get Liz.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.587
COLBY:
Probably no cell service inside.

34:15.621 --> 34:19.425
I'm still not getting anything
from the prison switchboards.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.393
Fuel truck.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.605
I got a man down.

34:37.276 --> 34:38.410
Is he dead?

34:38.444 --> 34:39.711
Yeah.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.650
Thing's empty.
It's a Trojan horse.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.652
The guys are already
inside the prison.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.787
SWAT's out on a call right now--
it'll be at least 20 minutes.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.323
All right, look, we got
45 officers in there

34:51.357 --> 34:52.558
on our side, right?
- Yeah, but their guns

34:52.591 --> 34:54.226
are locked in the armory--
it's gonna

34:54.260 --> 34:55.227
take time to distribute them.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.563
If we wait, it's over--
I say we make our move.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.131
Let's go.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.711
(buzzer)

35:12.744 --> 35:15.381
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Diane Verano.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.383
Nice to meet you.
Special Agent Liz Warner.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.718
I'm gonna be heading the
transport and safe house detail.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.554
I just have some paperwork
for Mr. Tabakian to sign,

35:22.588 --> 35:23.755
then he's all yours.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.424
No problem.

35:41.607 --> 35:42.774
Hey, you guys...

35:42.808 --> 35:44.510
(silenced gunshots)

35:57.356 --> 35:59.191
Hey! FBI. You've
been breached.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.759
You got guys in here
with weapons.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.461
They already killed one
of your guys-- get some men

36:02.494 --> 36:04.296
to the armory and break out the
weapons.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.198
Go, move!
Megan, go with him!

36:06.232 --> 36:07.566
Got it, got it.

36:07.599 --> 36:08.667
(buzzer)

36:12.571 --> 36:13.672
Mr. Tabakian.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.241
Well...

36:15.274 --> 36:20.712
This is even better
than I expected.

36:20.746 --> 36:21.847
(alarm buzzing)

36:21.880 --> 36:24.516
(P.A.): Attention all personnel!
Attention all personnel!

36:24.550 --> 36:28.387
Be advised, the entire facility
is now on lockdown.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.688
utility room!the

36:29.721 --> 36:31.657
End of the corridor!

36:31.690 --> 36:33.492
Go left!

36:33.525 --> 36:36.395
All prisoners, return to your
cells immediately.

36:36.428 --> 36:39.698
All prisoners, return
to your cells immediately.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.406
We have a deal.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.641
You have to protect me.

36:49.675 --> 36:52.678
The entire facility is now on
lockdown.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.947
This is a mandatory lockdown.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.716
(indistinct shouting)

36:57.749 --> 36:58.584
Don't move!

36:59.785 --> 37:02.788
How many more in there?

37:02.821 --> 37:04.523
It's clear, you guys can
come on.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.725
Let's go!

37:08.360 --> 37:09.861
This is too hard to defend.

37:09.895 --> 37:10.929
Don, we got to go.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.531
DON:
Liz, come here.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.801
Come on.

37:15.834 --> 37:16.802
DON:
All right.

37:20.406 --> 37:21.407
It's clear.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.576
Clear on this side.

37:25.677 --> 37:26.578
You guys stay close.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.814
You hear gunshots,
you get to the ground.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.849
All right, put him in the guard
station up there.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.751
Door!

37:34.986 --> 37:36.288
Get down!

37:36.322 --> 37:37.289
Get down!

37:42.661 --> 37:43.829
Is he all right?

37:43.862 --> 37:45.397
(groaning in pain)

37:45.431 --> 37:47.966
We got a prisoner down!
We need EMT right away!

37:47.999 --> 37:49.935
MAN: Copy that, medical team
four minutes out.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.002
Got no pulse.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.738
All right?
Yeah.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.906
Okay, just keep
breathing, keep breathing.

37:54.940 --> 37:55.841
(groans)

38:02.448 --> 38:04.082
How is he?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.784
The bullet passed clean through.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.654
They don't think
it hit any vitals, so...

38:08.687 --> 38:10.556
he'll live.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.759
You guys saved

38:13.792 --> 38:15.694
his ass, Epps.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.097
Not to mention what you
did for me back there.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.933
Hey, now, don't sweat it.
You kidding?

38:21.967 --> 38:24.069
But now I owe you one.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.472
Well, that's just the way
I want it, so...

38:26.505 --> 38:28.507
debt.now I don't like being in

38:28.540 --> 38:29.508
No?

38:29.541 --> 38:32.511
What are you gonna do about it?

38:32.544 --> 38:34.680
Get even.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.582
All right, I'm ready
for you, tough guy.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.049
COLBY:
Hey, Don.

38:38.083 --> 38:41.019
You got the warden waiting
in his office to talk to you.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.821
All right, one sec.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.690
- I got to run.
- Mm-hmm.

38:44.723 --> 38:47.125
I want to get him out of town
before they have a chance

38:47.158 --> 38:49.361
to try again, so...

39:19.124 --> 39:21.627
Hey.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.430
What are you guys
doing up so late?

39:24.463 --> 39:26.398
Hey, hey, Charlie told me
what happened today,

39:26.432 --> 39:28.166
and, uh, we were worried.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.568
Well, he was worried.

39:29.601 --> 39:30.969
I-I just stayed up

39:31.002 --> 39:32.538
to savor an "I told you so"
moment

39:32.571 --> 39:33.472
while it was still fresh.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.806
- Hold on, we dealt with this.
- Did we?

39:34.840 --> 39:36.575
There-There was
so much going on.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.177
Accusations about my math
being shifty.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.747
All right, Charlie, have
your moment, go ahead, say it.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.948
I told you so.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.416
I told you so.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.751
All right, there you go.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.719
Well, that's about as much
brotherly love as I can

39:47.753 --> 39:48.987
take tonight--
I'm going to bed.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.756
Yeah, I'm done, so
I'm gonna hit the hay.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.758
Hey, look, uh...

39:52.791 --> 39:54.526
about Robin.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.494
Yeah, I said

39:55.527 --> 39:58.163
we-we're... I mean,
we're sorry, you know?

39:58.196 --> 40:00.599
Well, she broke up with me.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.869
About a week ago.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.136
Oh.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.572
She dumped you.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.606
Shut up.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.207
No, no, look, Donny, uh,

40:09.240 --> 40:10.776
I'm, uh, I'm really sorry.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.010
What happened?

40:12.043 --> 40:14.045
You know, it takes two, and, uh,

40:14.079 --> 40:17.483
I guess she didn't want
to be one, what can I say?

40:17.516 --> 40:18.850
Mm.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.185
Well...

40:20.218 --> 40:22.654
you know, maybe she'll
change her mind.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.022
Yeah.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.794
Anyway...

40:28.827 --> 40:30.662
Hey, now, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.698
That-that's a good sign,
isn't it?

40:32.731 --> 40:33.832
You're not the one

40:33.865 --> 40:34.966
that pulled the plug.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.102
You were willing
to go through with it.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.170
That's a good
sign, isn't it?

40:39.204 --> 40:41.206
A step in the right direction?

40:41.239 --> 40:44.075
I guess, if you say so.

40:45.911 --> 40:48.814
Hey, look, I'm not really tired.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.882
There's got to be
something good on late night.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.551
You know, that's when
they play the classics. Let's...

40:52.584 --> 40:54.019
stay up,mean, if we're gonna

40:54.052 --> 40:55.253
then I'll just pop some popcorn,
and...

40:55.286 --> 40:56.788
Guys, you don't have to do this.

40:56.822 --> 40:57.489
ALAN: Do what?

40:57.523 --> 40:58.423
Seriously, go to bed. I'm okay.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.925
Hey, come on,
you don't even live here--

40:59.958 --> 41:01.827

what to do?

on TV) song to Taxi playing

41:04.262 --> 41:06.765
