WEBVTT

00:06.801 --> 00:07.866
Camp security coordinator.

00:07.867 --> 00:09.633
Devon? Oh, baby,
you're burning up.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.534
Justin!

00:12.233 --> 00:13.633
They just left.

00:13.634 --> 00:15.834
I took care of the husband
and made it look like malaria.

00:15.901 --> 00:17.766
She doesn't suspect a thing.

00:17.767 --> 00:18.833
Guys, we got
to get this place fixed up

00:18.834 --> 00:20.099
before Devon and Ellie get back.

00:20.100 --> 00:23.133
Well, actually, I was going
to start with our place.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.367
That is, if your offer for me
to move in still stands.

00:26.434 --> 00:28.334
Yeah.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.132
It's official.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.033
There is absolutely
nothing on TV.

00:37.034 --> 00:39.701
Yeah. Monday nights can be
a bit of a wasteland.

00:39.767 --> 00:43.534
President Jakaya Kuti of Zamibia
arrived in Los Angeles today.

00:43.601 --> 00:45.499
On his agenda
are diplomatic meetings

00:45.500 --> 00:47.033
and a performance of Beethoven

00:47.034 --> 00:49.133
tomorrow night by
The LA City Symphony.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.100
Ugh, sounds like Beckman.

00:52.068 --> 00:53.900
Hey. Jackpot!

00:53.901 --> 00:56.767
Oh, no, no, no. You've made me
watch this before.

00:56.834 --> 00:58.299
This is ridiculous.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.400
Sarah, please.
You could learn a lot

01:00.467 --> 01:01.700
from spies like these.

01:01.701 --> 01:02.967
Are you kidding me?

01:02.968 --> 01:04.666
Look at these people.

01:04.667 --> 01:06.767
They're breaking about 17
different rules of protocol!

01:06.834 --> 01:08.399
Sweetheart,

01:08.400 --> 01:11.500
I'm not actually implying
that you could learn anything

01:11.567 --> 01:13.467
about being a spy from
Chevy Chase or Dan Aykroyd.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.266
I was just simply making a joke.

01:15.267 --> 01:17.099
You remember?
Jokes?

01:17.100 --> 01:18.967
Taking a girl out, you know,
and buying her dinner,

01:18.968 --> 01:20.868
and then she won't
put out for you.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.601
I love you.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.133 --> 01:56.499
Sorry. I must have
fallen asleep.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.734
Chuck.

01:58.801 --> 02:00.734
I love you.

02:02.434 --> 02:05.968
Oh, Sarah, it feels so good
to finally hear you say that.

02:10.334 --> 02:12.234
Sarah, look outside, quick.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.166
Finally.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.566
I'm so hungry.

02:16.567 --> 02:17.967
Isn't it great
we found a place

02:17.968 --> 02:19.866
that delivers Zamibian food?

02:19.867 --> 02:21.767
Zamibian food?

02:23.400 --> 02:24.866
Hello, Chuck.

02:24.867 --> 02:26.767
Shaw?

02:51.534 --> 02:52.533
Oh, what?

02:52.534 --> 02:54.500
Did you have
another bad dream?

02:56.801 --> 02:57.900
It was, it was
about Beethoven...

02:57.901 --> 02:59.801
and Zamibia...

02:59.867 --> 03:01.366
Chuck, I'm worried about you.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.434
Every time you fall asleep,
you have a horrible nightmare.

03:03.500 --> 03:07.001
But this one was trying
to tell me something.

03:07.068 --> 03:09.634
Tell you what?

03:09.701 --> 03:11.033
General, the Ring
is going to try

03:11.034 --> 03:12.566
and kill
the president of Zamibia

03:12.567 --> 03:14.834
at the Beethoven concert
tomorrow night!

03:14.901 --> 03:17.200
Tomorrow night?

03:17.267 --> 03:18.766
We could have done
this in the morning?

03:18.767 --> 03:21.901
You know how dear my sleep
is to me, Bartowski.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.132
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Casey

03:23.133 --> 03:25.167
and General. I-I know
that it's very late,

03:25.233 --> 03:27.133
and you are
obviously very...

03:29.300 --> 03:30.733
...busy. Um...

03:30.734 --> 03:32.399
But the president of Zamibia
is in danger.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.300
Did you flash
on something, Chuck?

03:34.335 --> 03:36.132
I...

03:36.133 --> 03:38.033
Mm...

03:39.068 --> 03:40.700
I know it
because of my dream.

03:40.701 --> 03:43.400
Your...
Your dream?

03:43.467 --> 03:44.499
I've been having these

03:44.500 --> 03:45.766
very, very vivid dreams, okay?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.132
First, I saw the news report

03:47.133 --> 03:48.900
on Kuti, the president
of Zamibia,

03:48.901 --> 03:50.533
but then in my dream,
I saw Beethoven.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.901
And then Shaw was there, and he
was delivering Zamibian food.

03:52.968 --> 03:53.967
And then he tried
to kill everyone!

03:53.968 --> 03:55.800
So, obviously,
the Zamibian president

03:55.801 --> 03:57.199
is going to be assassinated

03:57.200 --> 03:59.250
by the Ring
at the Beethoven concert.

03:59.285 --> 04:01.300
General,
permission to slap Bartowski?

04:02.634 --> 04:03.900
He had a bad dream.

04:03.901 --> 04:06.133
General, Chuck has been
under a lot of stress lately

04:06.200 --> 04:07.199
with these dreams, and-

04:07.200 --> 04:08.232
No, Walker.

04:08.233 --> 04:10.434
I think I understand
the situation.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.068
And, to be honest,
it makes perfect sense.

04:13.133 --> 04:15.233
Thank you.
Thank you, General.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.632
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

04:16.634 --> 04:18.166
What are we going to do, huh?
What's our assignment?

04:18.166 --> 04:20.834
Chuck, I'm assigning you

04:20.901 --> 04:22.266
to see a CIA therapist.

04:22.267 --> 04:23.967
These dreams you're having

04:23.968 --> 04:25.800
are getting
in the way of your work,

04:25.801 --> 04:27.033
and our sleep.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.167
No, no, no, no. This is crazy.
A therapist?

04:29.233 --> 04:30.466
I don't need a therapist, okay?

04:30.467 --> 04:32.333
Therapists are for people
who have real problems.

04:32.334 --> 04:33.800
I'm fine.

04:33.801 --> 04:37.267
<i>Are you comfortable, Chuck?</i>

04:37.334 --> 04:38.633
No, no,

04:38.634 --> 04:40.534
not particularly. No.

04:40.601 --> 04:42.000
How does this work,
exactly?

04:42.001 --> 04:43.399
I've only seen
what you see in movies

04:43.400 --> 04:44.800
and stuff like that.

04:44.801 --> 04:46.433
Do you ask me questions?

04:46.434 --> 04:48.734
And I just answer? Or is it
like a word association thing?

04:48.801 --> 04:50.000
So, you would, like,
say "father" and-

04:50.001 --> 04:52.100
Actually, no, no, no.
Give me another word.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.467
Do you want to talk about
your father, Chuck?

04:57.400 --> 05:00.001
This wasn't my idea,
you know.

05:00.068 --> 05:03.233
So, no, I don't really
want to talk about anything,

05:03.300 --> 05:05.200
to be perfectly honest.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.334
Despite your sparkling
conversation skill.

05:11.634 --> 05:13.466
That was, that was a joke.

05:13.467 --> 05:14.633
I was just...

05:14.634 --> 05:16.767
Just going to town on
that pad, aren't you?

05:16.834 --> 05:18.934
Just a little joke.
Okay, fine. I'll talk.

05:20.167 --> 05:21.933
Where do I start?
Uh...

05:21.934 --> 05:24.601
Okay, well, my girlfriend
just moved in with me.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.000
Best part of my life.

05:26.001 --> 05:28.167
Really rock-solid relationship.

05:28.233 --> 05:30.133
Not a problem there.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.199
You know, she's
a little distant.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.499
She could be more
communicative, though.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.900
But she doesn't exactly say,
"I love you" back.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.232
I've never really
done this before, you know?

05:35.233 --> 05:36.600
Even though I know
that she loves me,

05:36.601 --> 05:38.000
I'm just, you know,
just kind of noting it.

05:38.001 --> 05:39.600
Because I know.
I know that she loves me.

05:39.601 --> 05:41.199
And I know that.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.100
Do you?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.300
Let's get back
to your dreams.

05:48.334 --> 05:51.100
It's my belief that they are
a product of your subconscious

05:51.167 --> 05:53.067
interacting with the Intersect.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.299
Wait, what?

05:56.300 --> 05:59.300
How...

05:59.367 --> 06:01.901
You know about the Intersect?

06:01.968 --> 06:04.034
I'm a CIA psychiatrist.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.068
I know everything
about you, Chuck.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.666
And as far as the
Intersect goes,

06:07.667 --> 06:08.766
we've known for some time

06:08.767 --> 06:12.068
that it could spur
a host of side effects.

06:12.133 --> 06:13.633
Like dry scalp?

06:13.634 --> 06:17.034
Because I have had
annoyingly dry scalp since...

06:17.100 --> 06:19.601
The Intersect is
extraordinarily powerful.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.867
It has the
potential to...

06:21.934 --> 06:24.133
overwhelm your mind.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.500
With an end result akin
to something much like...

06:27.567 --> 06:29.701
insanity.

06:29.767 --> 06:30.967
Insanity?

06:30.968 --> 06:34.334
Doc, I'm not insane.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.766
And you're not
sure about that.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.734
So, it could just be that
the Intersect is doing its thing

06:37.801 --> 06:39.166
while I'm sleeping.

06:39.167 --> 06:42.300
<i>And if that's true, then
President Kuti is in danger.</i>

06:42.367 --> 06:43.800
Slow down, Chuck.

06:43.801 --> 06:45.767
Something is going to happen
at the concert tonight, okay?

06:45.834 --> 06:47.700
And if I'm there,
we-we could stop it

06:47.701 --> 06:49.099
And then I'm not crazy, right?

06:49.100 --> 06:52.034
I'm sorry, Chuck,
but I can't let you do that.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.200
Until further notice,

06:54.267 --> 06:56.367
I'm removing you
from field duty.

06:58.842 --> 07:03.020
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

07:45.467 --> 07:46.633
There he is.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.401
Welcome home, pal.

07:48.402 --> 07:50.100
It's good
to be home.

07:50.101 --> 07:51.366
Hey, look at you. All right.
You know what?

07:51.367 --> 07:53.701
I'd say malaria aside,
you look pretty...

07:53.767 --> 07:54.766
awesome.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.366
I actually feel
pretty great.

07:56.367 --> 07:58.167
I'm ready to get
back out there.

07:58.168 --> 07:59.700
I had an important realization.

07:59.701 --> 08:01.601
That looks don't
get you everywhere?

08:03.267 --> 08:04.966
No, Morgan.

08:04.967 --> 08:07.734
You can die just as easily
from a mosquito in Africa

08:07.801 --> 08:09.433
as you can
from a spy in Burbank.

08:09.434 --> 08:10.466
This is what I'm talking about.

08:10.467 --> 08:11.800
Listen. Fear is
the mind killer.

08:11.801 --> 08:13.584
Yeah.

08:13.585 --> 08:15.299
Right.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.599
You can't live scared, bro.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.200
Not for yourself,
not for anyone.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.567
I think it's jammed a
little bit, or something.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.367
This one's broken.

08:29.701 --> 08:32.267
Oh. Hey.
Ah, Ellie.

08:32.332 --> 08:34.267
I heard Devon has malaria.

08:34.332 --> 08:35.399
Yeah.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.399
Nasty stuff.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.833
Had it four,
maybe five times myself.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.801
Tough to say.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.633
Uh, you know, those meds
aren't going to help him.

08:42.634 --> 08:45.767
What he needs are
African snake herbs.

08:45.834 --> 08:47.232
I might have some
back at my place.

08:47.233 --> 08:49.134
I will keep that in mind, John.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.833
Thank you.

08:50.834 --> 08:54.167
Okay.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.599
Crazy.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.500
<i>You're not crazy.</i>

09:01.333 --> 09:03.233
Don't freak out.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.700
Chuck, you in there?

09:05.701 --> 09:07.601
Come in.

09:08.767 --> 09:10.067
Hey.
Hey.

09:10.068 --> 09:11.232
How was the doctor's?

09:11.233 --> 09:13.867
Uh, good.
Great, actually.

09:13.934 --> 09:15.834
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
What about you?

09:15.867 --> 09:17.332
You hear anything
from Beckman

09:17.333 --> 09:19.000
about anything?

09:19.001 --> 09:22.001
Chuck, I know I'm your partner,
but I'm also your girlfriend.

09:22.068 --> 09:24.567
And you can tell
me anything.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.666
I know that.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.433
Of course I-
Of course I know that.

09:29.434 --> 09:32.367
Honestly.
Hey, I'm fine, okay?

09:32.434 --> 09:36.134
Just a solid good night's rest,
and I'm right as rain.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.500
Which I don't
totally understand

09:38.567 --> 09:41.168
'cause rain is
kind of all over the place.

09:43.967 --> 09:45.867
Glad you're okay.
Thanks.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.034
<i>Nothing like absorbing
a little local culture.</i>

09:54.101 --> 09:57.034
President Jakaya Kuti of Zamibia
will be in town today.

09:57.101 --> 10:00.233
The tiny African nation
seeks to improve its

10:00.300 --> 10:02.033
rocky diplomatic relations...
Okay, Chuck.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.900
You're watching more
cable television

10:03.901 --> 10:05.100
than is healthy
for a young man.

10:05.101 --> 10:07.034
Please talk to me.
What's going on?

10:07.101 --> 10:10.567
Buddy, I've been having the
strangest and most vivid dreams

10:10.634 --> 10:11.766
that I've ever had
in my life.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.100
How vivid are we
talking about here?

10:13.101 --> 10:15.667
Well, they have
to do with that guy.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.834
I guess he's kind of handsome in
an an authoritative kind of way.

10:19.901 --> 10:20.933
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:20.934 --> 10:22.000
Well, me, neither.

10:22.001 --> 10:23.299
But he's the
president of Zamibia,

10:23.300 --> 10:24.533
and he's going to be at
the symphony tonight.

10:24.534 --> 10:25.966
And the dream that I had
made me think that...

10:25.967 --> 10:28.101
<i>Made me know that
he's in danger, man.</i>

10:28.168 --> 10:29.533
But Beckman sent
me to some doctor

10:29.534 --> 10:30.833
who thinks that it's
just the Intersect

10:30.834 --> 10:32.232
playing with my
subconscious,

10:32.233 --> 10:33.900
but I know that I'm right,
and nobody believes me.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.599
Sarah doesn't believe you?

10:35.600 --> 10:38.901
S- I'm trying not to
involve Sarah in this, okay?

10:38.967 --> 10:40.199
Things are very good
between us right now,

10:40.200 --> 10:41.366
and the last thing I want

10:41.367 --> 10:42.466
is for her to think that I'm
- Crazy.

10:42.467 --> 10:43.466
Yeah.

10:43.467 --> 10:45.232
Well, here's the thing.

10:45.233 --> 10:46.733
If this guy really
is in danger, right?

10:46.734 --> 10:49.101
Then don't you think it would be
crazy not to help the president

10:49.168 --> 10:50.299
of Zanfiria-bi-ha?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.300
Zam, uh...
Zamibia.

10:52.367 --> 10:55.034
Yeah. Anyway,
I'm gonna help you.

10:55.101 --> 10:56.499
Thanks, buddy, thank you.
Yeah, of course.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.534
What's your pant size,
Chuck?

11:00.867 --> 11:02.266
I'm just gonna say it:

11:02.267 --> 11:04.033
I need a woman.

11:04.034 --> 11:06.200
It's been far too long,
Jeffrey.

11:06.267 --> 11:07.299
A man has needs.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.599
So what's the plan?

11:08.600 --> 11:10.000
I will be hitting on all

11:10.001 --> 11:11.901
the applicable women
in electronics, DVDs,

11:11.967 --> 11:13.332
and all around
the entrances

11:13.333 --> 11:15.233
<i>and the emergency exits.</i>

11:15.300 --> 11:17.000
You're leaving me
Home Appliances?

11:17.001 --> 11:19.200
It's full of lumpy housewives.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.600
My favorite.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.567
You're welcome.

11:24.634 --> 11:29.567
OMG, Jefferson,
is it a mirage?

11:29.634 --> 11:31.466
* *

11:31.467 --> 11:32.900
No, my eyes do not deceive me.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.200
It is indeed her.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.500
* *

11:40.467 --> 11:41.800
It is Anna Wu.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.267
I knew the day she left
to break Morgan's heart,

11:44.333 --> 11:47.168
she'd come back to break mine.

11:47.233 --> 11:49.133
Crush it!

11:50.068 --> 11:52.834
Hi, guys.
Long time no smell.

11:52.901 --> 11:54.801
She remembered our smell.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.834
Annabelle, have you
lost weight?

11:56.901 --> 11:59.034
Two, three grams?

11:59.101 --> 12:02.333
Hawai'iis treating your body
very well.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.566
Thanks.
Is Morgan around?

12:03.567 --> 12:04.566
Who?
Who?

12:04.567 --> 12:05.599
What now?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.133
Morgan... Grimes.

12:07.134 --> 12:09.168
He does still work here,
doesn't he?

12:12.101 --> 12:13.666
Hey.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.366
Two tickets to the
LA. City Symphony.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.184
Two tuxedos from the mall.

12:17.185 --> 12:18.933
No cummerbund.
Call me crazy.

12:18.934 --> 12:20.067
Well done, buddy.

12:20.068 --> 12:21.933
You nailed it.
I'm gonna head out the back.

12:21.934 --> 12:23.834
You meet me
at the Herder in five.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.666
Done. All right, let's go.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.901
Well, I hate to be the one
to tell you this-

12:27.967 --> 12:30.168
I don't really-

12:30.233 --> 12:31.900
but Morgan is in, a, um...

12:31.901 --> 12:34.001
a very bad place.

12:34.068 --> 12:35.566
Oh, my God, is he okay?

12:35.567 --> 12:38.134
No. He's focused,
responsible, driven.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.333
Pains me to see a man
end up like that.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.466
It's pathetic.

12:41.467 --> 12:42.599
Nice try.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.967
He can't have
changed that much.

12:45.034 --> 12:47.467
* *

12:53.233 --> 12:54.266
Whoo!

12:54.267 --> 12:56.168
* *

13:03.934 --> 13:05.266
Whoa, Anna,

13:05.267 --> 13:06.266
what are you
doing here?

13:06.267 --> 13:07.566
In L.A. for a few days.

13:07.567 --> 13:08.566
Came to see you.

13:08.567 --> 13:09.966
There are some things
that I want...

13:09.967 --> 13:11.266
Sorry.

13:11.267 --> 13:12.466
Sorry, don't meant to be rude.
I just...

13:12.467 --> 13:14.100
Duty calls.

13:14.101 --> 13:15.766
<i>You mean,
Call of Duty?</i>

13:15.767 --> 13:17.667
Come on, Morgan,
your game can wait.

13:17.702 --> 13:19.299
Why are you in a tux?

13:19.300 --> 13:20.433
Uh, tux, right.

13:20.434 --> 13:21.900
I'm going to the
symphony with Chuck.

13:21.901 --> 13:22.966
The symphony?
With Chuck?

13:22.967 --> 13:24.766
My God, can you guys
get any weirder?

13:24.767 --> 13:26.232
At this point, no,
probably not.

13:26.233 --> 13:28.200
Listen, I'd love to catch up
and talk and everything.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.100
Why don't you call me
tomorrow morning, all right?

13:30.101 --> 13:32.001
And, uh, you look good.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.467
Wow!

13:46.267 --> 13:48.167
Excuse me.

13:49.767 --> 13:51.667
Hey, buddy, buddy,
that's Kuti up in

13:52.034 --> 13:53.533
the president's box there.

13:53.534 --> 13:55.332
Our mission: to make sure
nothing happens to him.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.001
Now remember, Morgan, my code
name is Charles Carmichael.

13:58.068 --> 13:59.700
Yeah, yeah,
I got it. I got it.

13:59.701 --> 14:00.866
Mine's Cobra.

14:00.867 --> 14:03.467
Okay, let's do this.

14:03.534 --> 14:06.434
Great. I'm on a mission
with Cobra.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.734
<i>Maybe I am going crazy.</i>

14:10.001 --> 14:11.733
<i>Are you sure you want</i>

14:11.734 --> 14:13.167
<i>the box set of ER?</i>

14:13.168 --> 14:16.434
Hey, but all 15 seasons?

14:18.634 --> 14:21.168
Yeah, I know, Devon,
it's the best show ever.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.000
Okay, fine.

14:23.001 --> 14:25.567
I'll see you later. Bye.

14:25.634 --> 14:27.534
Ellie?

14:31.567 --> 14:32.900
Justin?!

14:32.901 --> 14:34.566
Oh, I'm sorry. This is,
this is bizarre.

14:34.567 --> 14:35.866
Why aren't you in Africa?

14:35.867 --> 14:38.600
Did you, did you...
did you get malaria, too? What?

14:38.667 --> 14:41.300
No, I'm actually here
to see you.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.267
Can we go somewhere
and talk for a bit?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.667
Let me ask you
a question.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.333
This whole Anna
thing, you know?

15:04.334 --> 15:06.401
I mean, you think
she wants me back?

15:06.467 --> 15:08.401
Better question, actually:
Do I take her back?

15:08.467 --> 15:09.966
Didn't she break
your heart, buddy?

15:09.967 --> 15:11.633
I mean, you did
hit rock bottom.

15:11.634 --> 15:14.367
Well, bottom, yeah,
but rock bottom?

15:14.434 --> 15:16.534
Shh!

15:16.601 --> 15:18.300
Look, later,
all right, buddy?

15:18.301 --> 15:19.866
Remember, we're
on a mission.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.033
Eyes on the president.

15:21.034 --> 15:22.033
Shh!

15:22.034 --> 15:24.134
Sorry.

15:24.201 --> 15:26.501
She's, she's kind of like
the love of my life, you know?

15:26.568 --> 15:27.899
And when you want
to talk about Sarah-

15:27.900 --> 15:29.133
which is constantly-
we talk about Sarah.

15:29.134 --> 15:30.799
So I just thought maybe
you could help me out.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.600
Hey-hey-hey,
that is not fair!

15:32.601 --> 15:34.501
Shh!

15:47.534 --> 15:50.234
You work for the CIA?

15:51.967 --> 15:54.234
I know it's a lot
to process,

15:54.301 --> 15:57.267
but meeting you in Africa
wasn't an accident.

15:57.334 --> 15:58.699
I wanted to talk
to you then,

15:58.700 --> 15:59.699
but your husband got sick

15:59.700 --> 16:00.799
before we could
fully brief you.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.934
This is about your father,
Ellie.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.100
My father? My father?

16:06.167 --> 16:08.100
Are you kidding me?

16:08.167 --> 16:10.100
My father is...

16:10.167 --> 16:12.234
He's eccentric, sure,

16:12.301 --> 16:14.467
But the work Stephen
J. Bartowski did

16:14.534 --> 16:16.634
in the field of molecular
computing has turned out

16:16.700 --> 16:18.233
to be... brilliant.

16:18.234 --> 16:19.933
Which is why
as we speak,

16:19.934 --> 16:23.534
there are some very bad
people looking for him,

16:23.601 --> 16:25.501
including a man
named John Casey.

16:25.536 --> 16:26.899
He's an NSA double agent.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.967
He's been monitoring you
for another organization.

16:32.568 --> 16:34.700
John Casey works
with my brother.

16:34.767 --> 16:37.934
You don't have to
take my word for it.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.934
Just... keep
an eye on him.

16:42.934 --> 16:44.834
I caution you about telling
anyone about this.

16:44.867 --> 16:47.601
But what about
my brother and my husband?

16:48.634 --> 16:50.166
Here's the problem:

16:50.167 --> 16:52.334
They're gonna tell
you you're crazy;

16:52.401 --> 16:55.234
as crazy as you think
I am right now.

16:55.301 --> 17:00.668
We came to you because
we need you, Ellie.

17:00.733 --> 17:03.000
Your father needs you.

17:08.501 --> 17:09.633
What are you doing here?

17:09.634 --> 17:11.266
Thought you had
a fancy date with Chuck.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.667
Saw him leave the store a little
while ago in his tux.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.934
Chuck's in a tux?

17:19.034 --> 17:21.334
Pull up surveillance
in the store entrance

17:21.401 --> 17:22.465
and the parking lot

17:22.467 --> 17:24.266
from 60 minutes ago.

17:24.267 --> 17:25.866
There, there!

17:25.867 --> 17:27.233
Roll it back.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.134
Freeze!

17:31.434 --> 17:33.099
The concert with the
Zamibian President.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.434
Chuck's gonna try and
prove us wrong about Kuti.

17:35.501 --> 17:37.401
I'm gonna kill them both.

17:42.668 --> 17:44.700
Hey, hey.

17:44.767 --> 17:46.133
Chuck.

17:46.134 --> 17:47.933
Why are you onstage?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.533
What?

17:49.534 --> 17:51.867
Buddy, I'm not onstage.

18:06.601 --> 18:08.767
You shot me, Chuck.

18:18.601 --> 18:19.899
What are you doing here?

18:19.900 --> 18:21.466
What are you trying to tell me?

18:21.467 --> 18:22.799
The dream isn't about me, Chuck.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.267
It's about a scientist:
Dr. Kowambe.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.000
Kowambe.

18:35.167 --> 18:36.732
Oh, my God, that's him!

18:36.733 --> 18:38.366
That's the guy
who's going to kill Kuti!

18:38.367 --> 18:39.966
What? Are you serious?
How do you know?

18:39.967 --> 18:41.533
I just had
another dream, buddy.

18:41.534 --> 18:43.501
I got to get up to the
president's box! Shh!

18:43.568 --> 18:45.501
Okay, listen, ma'am,
put a sock in it.

18:45.568 --> 18:47.233
You, Morgan,
stay in the seat.

18:47.234 --> 18:49.033
No. What if the seat is
dangerous? I could be attacked.

18:49.034 --> 18:50.766
You're not gonna
get attacked.

18:50.767 --> 18:53.167
There could be a sniper!
Shh! Fine, fine. Here.

18:53.234 --> 18:55.434
Take my backup
tranq gun.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.534
For life-or-death
situations only.

19:05.301 --> 19:07.201
There!

19:09.201 --> 19:11.101
You take Bartowski.

19:11.167 --> 19:13.067
I got the little elf.

19:16.134 --> 19:17.133
No, Chuck, stop.

19:17.134 --> 19:18.600
I can't let you do this.

19:18.601 --> 19:19.766
Sarah, listen, I had
another dream.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.300
The guy who's gonna
kill Kuti is in

19:21.301 --> 19:22.633
the president's box
right now!

19:22.634 --> 19:24.400
You should have told me,
and I could have helped you.

19:24.401 --> 19:25.766
I'm sorry, I am.

19:25.767 --> 19:27.400
I- I didn't want
to get you mixed up

19:27.401 --> 19:29.700
in all this dream stuff
until I had proof, all right?

19:29.767 --> 19:31.633
I love you,
and right now I need you

19:31.634 --> 19:33.534
to believe that I'm not crazy.

19:36.867 --> 19:39.134
Okay, well, let's get
into that box.

19:47.733 --> 19:49.867
Stand up and walk
out of here quietly,

19:49.934 --> 19:52.668
or I'll kill you
and drag you out of here.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.668
Your choice.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.367
What are you reaching
for, Morgan?

20:00.434 --> 20:04.034
I've been authorized
to use this tranq gun.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.667
Now I don't want to, okay,

20:05.668 --> 20:07.568
'cause I consider us friends
now, but I will use this...

20:08.601 --> 20:11.000
Okay, here we go.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.534
Good evening.
Routine CIA weapons sweep.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.300
What is the meaning of this?!

20:20.301 --> 20:22.234
Listen, listen, the guy
right there.

20:22.301 --> 20:24.099
Dr. Kowambe?
Yeah, Dr. Kowambe.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.934
Mr. President,
who is this person?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.200
Bravo! Bravo!

20:28.201 --> 20:30.301
Okay, Chuck, just take it easy,
please.

20:30.367 --> 20:31.500
I'm taking it easy.

20:31.501 --> 20:33.033
I'm taking it very, very easy.

20:33.034 --> 20:34.832
Stop!

20:34.833 --> 20:38.833
This man is Africa's most
respected scientist!

20:40.100 --> 20:43.034
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

20:44.100 --> 20:45.166
This is preposterous!

20:45.167 --> 20:46.766
You could have at least have had

20:46.767 --> 20:48.667
the pretty one frisk me.

21:01.967 --> 21:03.699
Chuck, are you out
of your mind?!

21:03.700 --> 21:06.000
What are you doing?! I was wrong!
It's not an assassination attempt!

21:06.067 --> 21:07.799
He had Ring intel in his mouth!

21:07.800 --> 21:09.366
The tooth! The tooth!
Find the tooth! What?!

21:09.367 --> 21:13.234
This man is clearly insane!
Have this man arrested!

21:13.301 --> 21:15.133
There's hidden data
in the tooth!

21:15.134 --> 21:17.234
Wait a minute!
I can explain everything!

21:17.301 --> 21:19.099
Guys, guys, help me!

21:19.100 --> 21:21.000
I'm not crazy!

21:21.434 --> 21:23.334
Sarah!

21:29.734 --> 21:32.467
Explain how it's possible
that last night Chuck,

21:32.533 --> 21:34.100
aided by the world class spy

21:34.101 --> 21:35.699
that is Morgan Grimes,

21:35.700 --> 21:37.267
managed to elude you

21:37.268 --> 21:39.168
and cause
an international incident

21:39.201 --> 21:41.000
that the president
of the United States himself

21:41.001 --> 21:42.499
had to apologize for.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.866
In Zamibian.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.033
Tricky language.

21:45.034 --> 21:46.367
Lots of clicks and vowels.

21:46.368 --> 21:48.600
General, how is
Chuck doing?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.567
At the moment,

21:50.600 --> 21:54.467
Dr. Dreyfus
believes Chuck's condition is...

21:54.533 --> 21:56.233
worse than originally diagnosed.

21:56.234 --> 21:59.867
Originally diagnosed?
I- I don't understand.

21:59.934 --> 22:01.967
I'm sorry,

22:02.034 --> 22:04.934
but the doctor believes
the Intersect

22:05.001 --> 22:06.934
is overwhelming Chuck's brain.

22:07.001 --> 22:09.467
His mental deterioration
may be...

22:09.533 --> 22:11.267
unavoidable.

22:11.268 --> 22:13.634
He told me he was fine.

22:15.368 --> 22:18.101
Know that we will do
everything possible for him.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.767
I care about him, too.

22:26.334 --> 22:28.234
We'll go this afternoon.

22:30.134 --> 22:32.034
Nothing will make him feel
better than seeing you.

22:46.101 --> 22:47.799
Oh, my God. I can't believe
this is happening.

22:47.800 --> 22:48.966
It's happening, Chuck.

22:48.967 --> 22:50.399
Disturbing
as it may be,

22:50.400 --> 22:51.733
you're currently
a patient

22:51.734 --> 22:53.432
in a psychiatric
institution.

22:53.433 --> 22:57.034
Best to come to terms with that
sooner than later.

22:57.101 --> 22:59.834
Wow. You really know how
to make a guy feel better

22:59.901 --> 23:01.300
about his situation, Doc.

23:01.301 --> 23:03.100
You should meet some of
the other people here

23:03.101 --> 23:05.533
with serious
psychiatric issues.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.634
This is Lewis.

23:07.700 --> 23:10.001
Although he currently prefers
the name Merlin.

23:10.067 --> 23:11.166
Ooh, is that right?

23:11.167 --> 23:14.067
Merlin, like the...
th-the... like the wizard?

23:14.134 --> 23:15.566
What you in for?

23:15.567 --> 23:17.033
Is it something, uh...

23:17.034 --> 23:18.967
sexual?

23:19.034 --> 23:20.466
No! No, it's not!

23:20.467 --> 23:21.799
Not sexual at all.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.300
I've been having these
very troubling dreams.

23:23.301 --> 23:24.300
Sexual?

23:24.301 --> 23:26.133
Non-sexual
troubling dreams.

23:26.134 --> 23:27.466
Has my team
contacted you yet?

23:27.467 --> 23:29.700
Ugh, don't hold
your breath.

23:29.767 --> 23:31.667
I've been waiting for
my team since '93.

23:32.533 --> 23:33.966
That's enough, Lewis.

23:33.967 --> 23:35.666
What? His-his team?
What team?

23:35.667 --> 23:36.900
Who is this guy?
He's nuts.

23:36.901 --> 23:39.034
His spy team.

23:39.101 --> 23:41.134
This is a CIA facility.

23:41.201 --> 23:44.234
Everyone here
used to be a spy.

23:44.301 --> 23:46.867
As I don't have to tell
you, it's a stressful job.

23:46.934 --> 23:49.567
People tend
to... crack.

23:49.634 --> 23:50.933
Everyone here?

23:50.934 --> 23:53.067
Spies?

23:53.134 --> 23:55.034
Like me?

24:00.167 --> 24:01.766
John?

24:01.767 --> 24:04.034
Anybody home?

24:09.533 --> 24:10.666
Hi, Ellie.

24:10.667 --> 24:11.799
What's up?

24:11.800 --> 24:13.599
Hi, John. Um...

24:13.600 --> 24:16.634
I just remembered that you had
mentioned something about herbs

24:16.700 --> 24:18.333
for Devon's malaria.

24:18.334 --> 24:20.967
Right.
I'll check.

24:21.034 --> 24:23.034
Okay.

24:34.134 --> 24:36.034
Here you go.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.234
Make sure he takes them with
some nice, warm goat milk.

24:40.301 --> 24:42.800
Okay. Thank you.

24:42.867 --> 24:44.767
Ah.

24:49.700 --> 24:50.699
Whoa, El.

24:50.700 --> 24:51.799
Everything okay?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.100
Okay.

24:53.101 --> 24:55.001
I need you to listen
to me very closely,

24:55.034 --> 24:56.233
and I need you
to promise me

24:56.234 --> 24:57.333
that you're not
going to freak out.

24:57.334 --> 24:59.433
Okay.

25:01.368 --> 25:03.767
I have reason to believe that
our neighbor, John Casey,

25:03.834 --> 25:05.867
is a very,
very, bad man.

25:05.934 --> 25:07.666
And we need to get
far away from him.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.301
Babe, you got to get that story
about him getting drunk

25:10.368 --> 25:12.200
and peeing himself
out of your mind.

25:12.201 --> 25:14.134
He was in a bad place.
It happens.

25:14.201 --> 25:15.699
No, Devon.
I was just in his apartment,

25:15.700 --> 25:16.833
and he has guns.

25:16.834 --> 25:18.066
Very big guns.

25:18.067 --> 25:19.333
We have to do something.

25:19.334 --> 25:21.500
Okay.

25:21.567 --> 25:24.533
Okay. Casey has
some serious guns.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.101
Is that creepy? Yes.

25:28.167 --> 25:30.167
Is that illegal?

25:30.234 --> 25:31.866
Sadly, no.

25:31.867 --> 25:33.699
You don't believe me?

25:33.700 --> 25:35.600
You don't believe me.

25:35.634 --> 25:39.001
It's just- it sounds
a little crazy, is all.

25:40.334 --> 25:41.900
You think that
I sound crazy?

25:41.901 --> 25:44.600
Come on, El.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.300
How about I make you
a cup of tea?

25:46.301 --> 25:48.368
Chamomile, maybe?

25:48.433 --> 25:50.433
Hmm? Less caffeine,
but still so delicious.

25:53.700 --> 25:57.433
Yes. Okay. I-I'm sure that
I do. I do sound crazy.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.400
Tea's great.
Thank you.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.467
<i>How you doing there, pal?</i>

26:06.533 --> 26:07.933
Hmm?

26:07.934 --> 26:09.733
Is there anything
we can do for you?

26:09.734 --> 26:11.634
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.400
I need you to get
some evidence analyzed.

26:16.467 --> 26:18.533
That scientist?
He's still out there,

26:18.600 --> 26:19.900
and he's working for the Ring.
I'm sure of it.

26:19.901 --> 26:21.834
Please, Chuck,
the way you're talking...

26:21.901 --> 26:24.034
Come on. It's me.

26:24.101 --> 26:26.034
I need to show you something.

26:37.634 --> 26:39.534
Sarah, give me your hand.

26:40.234 --> 26:42.368
Give your boyfriend your hand.

26:53.567 --> 26:55.233
Is that...

26:55.234 --> 26:57.268
Yeah. The tooth.

26:57.334 --> 26:58.933
Is it yours?

26:58.934 --> 27:01.067
What? No. That's crazy.

27:01.134 --> 27:02.900
It's Dr. Kowambe's tooth.

27:02.901 --> 27:04.901
And it's not real. It's fake.

27:04.967 --> 27:06.566
It contains Ring intel.

27:06.567 --> 27:08.267
Secrets, plans, something.

27:08.268 --> 27:09.599
In the tooth?

27:09.600 --> 27:11.267
Yeah. Try to keep
up, Casey. Okay?

27:11.268 --> 27:13.000
You need to get
that analyzed ASAP.

27:13.001 --> 27:14.901
The tooth is the key.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.567
The truth
is in the tooth.

27:19.967 --> 27:21.499
Oh. Well, uh...

27:21.500 --> 27:23.901
We'll check that out, and you
get some rest there, pal.

27:23.967 --> 27:27.500
We'll come back and
visit you tomorrow.

27:29.301 --> 27:31.268
Chuck.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.100
Sarah,

27:34.101 --> 27:36.134
you can't give up
on me, okay?

27:40.167 --> 27:41.666
I won't.

27:41.667 --> 27:43.567
I'll get it tested.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.067
Time to go, Chuck.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.532
Look, Walker,
I hope he's right, too,

28:24.533 --> 28:26.467
but don't be disappointed
if Bartowski's... Stop it!

28:26.533 --> 28:28.500
He's going to be right.

28:34.867 --> 28:36.767
Nothing abnormal.

28:38.101 --> 28:40.934
Just a tooth.

28:41.001 --> 28:43.433
Chuck was wrong.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.767
Hmm. I'm sorry.

28:45.834 --> 28:47.834
* *

28:55.034 --> 28:56.967
Excuse me. Does this
come in burgundy?

28:57.034 --> 28:59.334
Yes, sir. I-I believe
that does come in burgundy.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.766
I'll check
in the back for you.

29:00.767 --> 29:01.933
Hey.

29:01.934 --> 29:03.200
What's going on?
Where is Chuck?

29:03.201 --> 29:04.200
Not now. Not now.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.400
Listen. Please,
please, please.

29:06.467 --> 29:08.367
You got to tell me something,
all right? Just let me know

29:08.400 --> 29:10.300
he's okay.
Casey, please.

29:12.067 --> 29:13.300
They got him
in a lockdown,

29:13.301 --> 29:15.400
psychiatric facility.

29:15.467 --> 29:17.533
Seems the Intersect's giving
him a bit of a hard time.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.432
What? No. man, no.

29:19.433 --> 29:20.599
That's crazy.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.300
Morgan.

29:22.301 --> 29:23.799
There you are.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.399
Sorry to bother
you again,

29:25.400 --> 29:26.833
but do you
have a second?

29:26.834 --> 29:28.233
I get that you're assistant
manager now and all, but-

29:28.234 --> 29:30.201
Oh, hey, I'd love to.
I'd love to. I just...

29:30.268 --> 29:31.766
Now is not really
a good time.

29:31.767 --> 29:33.066
So...

29:33.067 --> 29:34.967
You look good.

29:34.967 --> 29:37.901
Dissed twice by Morgan Grimes?

29:37.967 --> 29:40.600
I can't believe
this is happening.

29:40.667 --> 29:42.567
Right there.
Diagonally.

29:43.634 --> 29:44.799
You have a call.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.700
Huh? Oh, thanks.
Hello?

29:46.735 --> 29:48.000
Chuck?

29:48.001 --> 29:49.599
You can...
Hey. Hey, hey, Sarah?

29:49.600 --> 29:51.734
Hey. Hey.

29:51.834 --> 29:53.767
Hey, so, uh...

29:53.834 --> 29:55.734
What did you find out?

29:56.700 --> 29:59.567
Chuck, we ran
every test possible,

29:59.634 --> 30:02.400
and... I'm sorry.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.467
It's just a tooth.

30:04.533 --> 30:06.433
Are you sure?

30:06.433 --> 30:08.667
Yeah, but even though you were
wrong about the tooth,

30:08.734 --> 30:10.133
it doesn't mean anything.

30:10.134 --> 30:12.433
The important thing
is to stay positive.

30:16.767 --> 30:18.333
Everything's going to be okay.

30:18.334 --> 30:21.067
I know.

30:23.967 --> 30:25.934
Thanks for trying.

30:41.901 --> 30:43.367
May I help you?

30:43.368 --> 30:46.901
I hope so. I'm here
to see a Charles Bartowski.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.566
Well, there's no record
of Dr. Dreyfus authorizing

30:53.567 --> 30:55.467
any after hours visits.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.667
So, if you don't mind,

30:57.734 --> 31:00.067
I don't want to have you
escorted from the building.

31:00.134 --> 31:02.400
Of course.

31:02.467 --> 31:04.367
That will not be necessary.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.634
Find me Bartowski.

31:20.268 --> 31:21.933
Good evening.

31:21.934 --> 31:24.467
Let me guess. You're here
because of Chuck.

31:24.533 --> 31:27.034
Doctor, I know
that there has

31:27.101 --> 31:29.934
to be something more
to his condition.

31:30.034 --> 31:31.900
He can't just be
deteriorating in this way.

31:31.901 --> 31:33.066
Why?

31:33.067 --> 31:34.666
Because you care about him?

31:34.667 --> 31:35.833
No. You don't understand.

31:35.834 --> 31:37.100
He's not like other people.

31:37.101 --> 31:39.001
He is...

31:41.134 --> 31:43.467
Incredibly special.

31:43.533 --> 31:47.101
Huh. Especially
to you, I gather.

31:47.167 --> 31:49.167
He needs to be okay.

31:50.301 --> 31:52.201
I- I need him to be okay.

31:52.268 --> 31:54.168
I'd like to go to
the hospital tonight

31:54.201 --> 31:55.499
and talk to him,

31:55.500 --> 31:58.101
try and figure this out,

31:58.167 --> 31:59.466
and then help
him somehow,

31:59.467 --> 32:01.367
you know?

32:03.268 --> 32:05.268
Please.

32:09.967 --> 32:11.867
I love him.

32:12.433 --> 32:14.333
Ever tell him that?

32:15.533 --> 32:18.134
Please, Doctor,
I'm begging you.

32:18.201 --> 32:20.400
You're not
the only one.

32:31.533 --> 32:34.368
<i>Well, I'm really glad
the doctor wants to see me,</i>

32:34.433 --> 32:36.467
because I sure want
to see the doctor.

32:36.533 --> 32:38.800
Hey. Whoa. There's no need
to be rough or physical.

32:38.867 --> 32:40.066
Jeez.

32:40.067 --> 32:41.967
Mr. Bartowski.

32:43.034 --> 32:44.733
Ooh.

32:44.734 --> 32:46.634
Not the doctor
I was expecting to see.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.934
Why did you take my tooth?

32:52.001 --> 32:54.134
More to the point,

32:54.201 --> 32:56.301
why did you take
the wrong tooth?

32:56.368 --> 32:57.367
What?

32:57.368 --> 32:59.700
Wha- the... the wrong tooth?

32:59.767 --> 33:01.700
The data is in a tooth.

33:01.767 --> 33:03.667
I believe

33:03.700 --> 33:05.634
this is the fake one
you are looking for.

33:07.001 --> 33:09.834
I was, I was right.

33:09.901 --> 33:11.066
I was right.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.034
Well, I was, I-I was wrong,
I was wrong.

33:13.101 --> 33:15.201
Clearly I was wrong,
but I was right!

33:15.268 --> 33:16.699
This is great news!
This is great news!

33:16.700 --> 33:17.766
That means I'm not crazy!

33:17.767 --> 33:18.833
Yes.

33:18.834 --> 33:21.400
It also means,
as soon as you tell me where

33:21.467 --> 33:23.834
you got your information-

33:23.901 --> 33:26.500
and rest assured,
you will tell me-

33:26.567 --> 33:29.800
you are going to die.

33:29.867 --> 33:31.300
No, that's not great news
at all.

33:31.301 --> 33:32.633
That's a giant needle-
bad, bad.

33:32.634 --> 33:34.166
Colored liquid
even worse.

33:34.167 --> 33:36.201
Yes, it's one of my favorites.

33:36.268 --> 33:37.766
Tetraclydine-

33:37.767 --> 33:39.901
a designer
psychotropic cocktail.

33:50.268 --> 33:52.268
Gah!

33:52.334 --> 33:54.234
In around ten minutes,

33:54.234 --> 33:56.867
you're going to be
extremely forthcoming.

34:03.001 --> 34:05.034
Dr. Dreyfus!

34:05.101 --> 34:07.001
Thank God!

34:15.967 --> 34:18.067
Guys. Guys!

34:21.234 --> 34:23.134
Guys, guys, help me, help me!

34:23.168 --> 34:25.069
I need you!

34:26.001 --> 34:27.900
Awesome. Take him
back to the room.

34:33.467 --> 34:35.367
Wah!

34:43.333 --> 34:45.234
Restrain him.

34:46.368 --> 34:47.632
I don't f-

34:47.634 --> 34:48.966
I don't feel so good.

34:48.967 --> 34:50.934
Let him go!

34:51.001 --> 34:53.900
Or suffer the wrath
of Merlin and his army!

34:57.301 --> 34:59.201
Spies, attack!

35:14.433 --> 35:15.966
Damn.

35:15.967 --> 35:17.300
It was a good idea,

35:17.301 --> 35:19.201
Merlin.
It's over.

35:20.268 --> 35:22.168
No one believes you.

35:24.467 --> 35:26.367
No one's coming for you.

35:45.834 --> 35:49.934
Chuck.

35:52.201 --> 35:53.733
Well, well.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.667
Looks like it's good we came.

35:55.734 --> 35:57.566
You came back for me.

35:57.567 --> 35:59.734
I'll always come back for you.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.867
So will Merlin, Chuck.

36:13.334 --> 36:15.467
It seems you're owed an apology,
Agent Bartowski.

36:15.534 --> 36:16.999
You were right about Kowambe.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.367
He was illegally harvesting
human organs,

36:19.434 --> 36:21.868
experimenting with genetic
manipulation and reengineering.

36:21.933 --> 36:25.701
He was scheduled to meet a Ring
operative to sell this research.

36:25.768 --> 36:27.668
Well, that's fantastic.

36:28.401 --> 36:30.534
I mean, not-not the organ
harvesting stuff, obviously.

36:30.601 --> 36:32.768
That's... that's
very, very sad.

36:32.834 --> 36:34.768
So, does this mean I have
a clean bill of health?

36:34.834 --> 36:38.933
It would seem that way, Chuck,
but I can't actually clear you.

36:41.167 --> 36:43.567
Well, then who can?

36:44.701 --> 36:47.334
So... what did
we land on here?

36:47.401 --> 36:48.999
That, uh,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.801
my dreams have the potential to
work in concert with my flashes?

36:51.868 --> 36:53.900
Is that where you think
we landed, Chuck?

36:53.967 --> 36:55.700
Oh, come on, Doc.

36:55.701 --> 36:57.233
Level with me.

36:57.234 --> 36:58.666
Am I cleared for duty or not?

36:58.667 --> 36:59.899
You were right, Chuck.

36:59.900 --> 37:02.401
Your dreams were caused
by the Intersect.

37:02.467 --> 37:03.899
I'm clearing you for duty.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.133
All right.

37:05.134 --> 37:06.867
But...

37:06.868 --> 37:08.768
But? But what?
Why is there a but?

37:08.834 --> 37:12.134
But your dreams
are also proof of stress

37:12.200 --> 37:14.467
the Intersect puts
on your brain.

37:14.534 --> 37:17.300
And it is my belief that
that stress would continue

37:17.367 --> 37:19.667
and intensify,
likely leading to

37:19.734 --> 37:23.667
serious mental deterioration.

37:26.701 --> 37:28.667
Um...

37:30.868 --> 37:33.567
What does that mean exactly?

37:33.634 --> 37:36.868
Am I okay?

37:36.933 --> 37:39.434
This is a new science.

37:41.434 --> 37:43.334
Time will tell.

37:44.467 --> 37:46.467
* *

37:50.000 --> 37:51.533
But if I may, Chuck,

37:51.534 --> 37:53.166
I think it's something
you should discuss

37:53.167 --> 37:56.000
with your partner, Agent Walker.

38:00.367 --> 38:02.267
Thanks, Doc.

38:08.734 --> 38:11.234
Morgan Guillermo Grimes,

38:11.300 --> 38:13.032
I refuse to be
denied an audience

38:13.033 --> 38:14.933
with the Burbank Buy More's
assistant manager.

38:14.968 --> 38:16.868
If you run off on me
one more time,

38:16.933 --> 38:18.967
I swear I'll call corporate.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.932
She could want
you back, man.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.967
That box could be
an improvised explosive device.

38:24.033 --> 38:25.566
Be extremely cool
around that thing.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.601
Hey, listen, I feel like
I owe you an explanation.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.834
I'm so sorry. Last few
days have been insane.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.099
Morgan, all I've been
trying to do

38:31.100 --> 38:33.000
is get a second of your time
to give you this.

38:33.035 --> 38:35.000
Some stuff you left behind
in Hawaii.

38:35.067 --> 38:36.967
Thought you may want it back.

38:38.234 --> 38:40.134
Huh.

38:40.167 --> 38:42.667
I think I'm okay
without it.

38:43.734 --> 38:45.634
Well...

38:46.667 --> 38:48.801
here's something else
you may have forgotten.

38:53.234 --> 38:54.733
I got to hand it
to you, Morgan.

38:54.734 --> 38:56.466
You really know
how to play a girl.

38:56.467 --> 38:59.768
Well, you know, some
men have it and-

38:59.834 --> 39:01.734
What are you talking about?
I don't... You know what

39:01.801 --> 39:03.266
they say about
not knowing you want something

39:03.267 --> 39:04.266
until you can't have it?

39:04.267 --> 39:06.167
Well, it's true.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.299
You've changed, Morgan.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.200
I want you back.

39:09.367 --> 39:10.633
Wow.

39:10.634 --> 39:12.868
Really?

39:12.933 --> 39:15.134
If it took me running
from you to realize

39:15.200 --> 39:17.267
that I'm somebody you want,
then I don't really think

39:17.334 --> 39:19.234
that you're the
person that I want.

39:19.967 --> 39:22.401
So, yeah,
you're right.

39:22.467 --> 39:24.801
I have changed.

39:24.868 --> 39:26.768
I'll see you later.

39:28.167 --> 39:30.501
I don't mind leftovers.

39:34.501 --> 39:36.066
Hey, Sarah, hey.
We need to talk.

39:36.067 --> 39:37.199
Sure, Chuck, but...

39:37.200 --> 39:38.733
No, look, this is
very important.

39:38.734 --> 39:40.734
I love you.

39:40.801 --> 39:43.067
It shouldn't have taken me
this long to say it,

39:43.134 --> 39:44.833
but I've never felt this way.

39:44.834 --> 39:46.366
Before you, the only future

39:46.367 --> 39:48.300
that I could think about
was my next mission.

39:48.367 --> 39:52.134
And now all I can think about
is a future with you.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.100
I love you, Chuck.

39:58.601 --> 40:00.501
I love you, too.

40:09.367 --> 40:11.467
So what did you want to tell me?

40:11.534 --> 40:12.733
Is it about the doctor?

40:12.734 --> 40:15.367
What did he say?

40:15.434 --> 40:19.434
He said that... I'm fine.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.467
So...

40:40.701 --> 40:42.032
Justin?
Hey.

40:42.033 --> 40:43.333
It's okay.

40:43.334 --> 40:56.734
It's just me.

40:56.801 --> 40:58.633
So what can I do?

40:58.634 --> 41:00.534
Do you know how to
contact your father?

41:02.601 --> 41:04.433
If we can talk to him, let
him know what's happening,

41:04.434 --> 41:05.633
we may be able
to protect him.

41:05.634 --> 41:08.200
He moves around a lot.

41:08.267 --> 41:09.733
He's...

41:09.734 --> 41:10.867
really paranoid.

41:10.868 --> 41:13.000
He doesn't trust anyone.

41:14.267 --> 41:15.767
Last time he left though,
he made sure

41:15.768 --> 41:17.668
that I had a way to contact him.

41:20.501 --> 41:22.299
Thank you, Ellie.

41:22.300 --> 41:24.834
And just remember, you're
serving your country.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.567
Shaw.

41:47.367 --> 41:49.534
You're not bleeding anymore.

41:49.601 --> 41:51.501
That's right, Chuck,
I'm not.

41:51.701 --> 41:54.033
What does that mean?

41:55.200 --> 41:57.100
It means I'm still alive.

41:58.601 --> 42:00.933
Hey, what's wrong?

42:05.601 --> 42:07.333
Nothing.

42:07.334 --> 42:09.267
Nothing. Sorry.

42:09.334 --> 42:11.234
Go back to sleep.
