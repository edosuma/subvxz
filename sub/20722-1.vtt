01:14.207 --> 01:15.841
<i> -Pollos?</i>
-Yes. There's seven more.

01:19.846 --> 01:22.081
There's a couple of girls.
I need two cups of blue.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.523
- Manolo!
- -That's it.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.834
- Manolo!

01:50.777 --> 01:53.445
Keep your fucking hoods on!

01:59.586 --> 02:04.289
Manolo!

02:04.291 --> 02:06.358
Take your clothes off!

02:07.427 --> 02:08.894
Turn the fuck around!

02:08.895 --> 02:11.330
You find a shoulder,
and you walk. Walk!

02:34.254 --> 02:35.587
Elena?

04:49.756 --> 04:51.790
If you can pay,
you can leave.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.295
Two thousand,
eight hundred dollars.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.699
That's what it costs you
to leave.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.002
We...

05:05.371 --> 05:06.838
I paid the coyote,

05:06.840 --> 05:09.007
the guy that brought us
to the Van in the desert.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.550
- I paid him in nuevo laredo.
- -Oh.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.018
See, that was your crossing fee.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.722
For him to get you here,
to the u-s-of-a.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.457
And here you are.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.327
Nothing is free here.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.899
Two thousand,
eight hundred dollars,

05:35.435 --> 05:37.569
and the longer you stay,
the more you have to pay!

05:37.571 --> 05:40.772
Nothing is free here.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.046
And just one more thing:

05:51.117 --> 05:52.384
Don't...

05:53.119 --> 05:54.553
Fuck with me.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.460
I could kill you

06:02.428 --> 06:04.763
and dump your body
out into the street.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.799
And no one would
even know who you were,

06:08.868 --> 06:10.936
or who they could call to ask.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.375
Welcome to America.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.920
Come on!

07:18.037 --> 07:19.905
-No, no, no...
-It's okay.

07:21.874 --> 07:24.142
--Alright then.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.782
Easy. There you go.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.451
No, no, no...

07:35.021 --> 07:36.721
It's okay. Shh.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.123
-I'm pregnant.
-Shh.

07:48.701 --> 07:49.701
Ooh.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.805
We've been working
real fucking hard.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.873
Smokey!

08:02.815 --> 08:04.182
What did you come down here for?

08:05.084 --> 08:06.718
Get the fuck outta here.

08:10.923 --> 08:11.556
How sweet...

08:15.928 --> 08:18.497
How the wheels roll around!

08:44.790 --> 08:46.191
Congratulations, guys!

08:46.193 --> 08:46.191
It's gonna be
a great opportunity

08:46.193 --> 08:49.160
for anybody
who wants to buy your house.

11:53.045 --> 11:56.915
How are you? Thanks for coming.
These are the owners.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.184
We're gonna look at the house.
You'll love it. It's fabulous.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.452
Come on this way.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.195
You like it?

12:11.197 --> 12:12.430
There you go.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.165
This is who you get.

12:16.435 --> 12:19.337
The boss says, no more
blue juice for the ladies...

12:20.139 --> 12:21.439
Unless they don't comply.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.977
Blue juice, huh?

12:31.183 --> 12:34.018
You must've made
one hell of an impression...

12:35.387 --> 12:36.888
Huh?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.860
Hey.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.463
You displease Kay, here,

12:48.834 --> 12:51.402
and I'll have to re-assess
our boundaries.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.926
When the food's cooked,
you'll bring it to them.

13:23.435 --> 13:24.469
Hey.

13:25.237 --> 13:26.571
Hey.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.578
You sleep?

13:34.547 --> 13:35.513
No.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.985
Did you hear anything
about where they keep the women?

13:41.587 --> 13:42.520
No.

13:48.894 --> 13:51.062
Feels like it's gonna
dry up on you, doesn't it?

13:53.399 --> 13:56.301
You think you're gonna find
an exit sign we didn't see,

13:56.303 --> 13:57.602
- or something?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.539
Let's go! Follow me!

14:15.421 --> 14:17.488
Elena! Elena!

14:41.447 --> 14:42.580
That was her.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.549
I saw her hands.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.154
She's in the house.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.569
Your wife is here?

15:10.309 --> 15:11.676
I have a wife too.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.313
She hasn't heard from me
in three weeks, now.

15:24.390 --> 15:25.590
He was traveling with her...

15:30.062 --> 15:32.063
We're from two towns
really close together...

15:33.399 --> 15:34.599
Just north of antig--

15:34.601 --> 15:36.134
there was a lot of us in Mexico.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.471
Look, we don't have time
for this.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.973
No time for what,<i> compadre?</i>

15:42.474 --> 15:43.641
Where are you goin'?

15:45.177 --> 15:47.078
There's nothing
you can do right now.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.080
Sit.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.549
Eat that bread.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.155
Might be all the food
you get today.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.960
"All-you-can-eat!"

16:05.197 --> 16:06.664
That's what my brother told me.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.969
There'd be these restaurants
here called buffets.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.138
All-you-can-eat.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.679
He's been here
the longest.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.082
I can't get much out of him.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.751
Can't get much out
of anybody, really.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.621
The first day I got here,
there was this one guy,

16:30.623 --> 16:32.190
he was a bit of a talker.

16:33.459 --> 16:35.593
There was an argument in here,
actually.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.298
The thugs came in fast,
roughed up a couple of guys,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.133
then they took him out.

16:45.237 --> 16:46.604
We never saw him again.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.054
I don't have money
to give these people.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.222
I think...

17:04.223 --> 17:05.623
If you cry now...

17:08.227 --> 17:11.561
You won't have enough for when
they drag you to the basement.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.330
What's in the basement?

17:42.094 --> 17:43.327
Psst.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.672
In this house,
nobody fucks around, you got it?

18:36.215 --> 18:38.483
Come on.

19:06.678 --> 19:07.845
Can you pay?

19:11.750 --> 19:14.452
<i> Señor,</i> my wife was here.
Is she okay?

19:15.187 --> 19:16.554
Yes, your wife is here.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.489
And you're gonna have
to pay for her too.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.493
She's okay?

19:29.701 --> 19:31.802
<i>Señor,</i> we don't have your money!

19:33.839 --> 19:36.707
We spent most of our money
before we got to nuevo Leon.

19:39.444 --> 19:42.346
The rest of it was stolen when
we were riding on the trains.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.748
Maybe you can
borrow it from someone.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.884
A cousin, aunt, uncle, brother.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.219
Something...

19:49.288 --> 19:51.389
<i> Señor,</i> why us?

19:51.391 --> 19:52.823
You know who we are.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.863
We were just trying
to take a ride into the town.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.269
You don't choose
the fish that bites.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.440
I have a boss,
who owns this house.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.475
And he wants his rent.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.978
He's a real asshole.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.415
You live in this house, you pay.

20:18.317 --> 20:20.818
-I don't wanna live here!
-Why don't you try and leave?

20:33.265 --> 20:34.465
Tomorrow...

20:35.467 --> 20:36.901
We make arrangements.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.395
Hi, sweetheart!

21:38.930 --> 21:40.665
Daddy's sweetie pie.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.633
Hi, sweetie pie.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.076
What the hell
is she doing in there?

21:52.711 --> 21:54.845
She's cleaning. Whatever.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.481
I don't want her
anywhere near Taylor,

21:57.483 --> 21:58.549
you understand?

21:58.551 --> 21:58.549
If you put a shirt on her

21:58.551 --> 22:01.319
it makes her more likely
to think about leaving.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.025
It's for me.

22:15.568 --> 22:20.471
Kay, I don't wanna have to go
over this again and again.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.640
I owe silo
a lot of fucking money.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.076
We have to be really careful,

22:25.078 --> 22:27.078
especially with his cousin
in the house.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.850
He was rubbing up on her...

22:35.554 --> 22:36.787
You know?

22:38.390 --> 22:39.056
Yeah.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.000
They've gotta be
after something else.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.907
He's gotta realize who we are.

23:00.479 --> 23:01.545
He knows.

23:04.716 --> 23:05.950
It is what it's about.

23:07.519 --> 23:08.719
Who we are.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.023
We're nobody.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.060
I don't have 3000 dollars!

23:19.831 --> 23:21.432
Nobody here does.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.167
That one guy did, today.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.970
He didn't come back, did he?

23:28.073 --> 23:29.940
Or maybe he didn't pay...

23:44.623 --> 23:45.990
These guys...

23:49.461 --> 23:51.962
They need bodies
to keep business going.

23:53.799 --> 23:55.666
New whores to pimp out.

23:56.034 --> 23:57.601
Drug mules, maybe.

24:00.472 --> 24:02.206
Or they might have
dangerous deliveries,

24:04.042 --> 24:06.210
all kinds of shit
to beat us into doing...

24:12.150 --> 24:14.051
How do you know all this stuff?

25:04.202 --> 25:06.871
Tonight. Yes.

25:14.145 --> 25:15.579
Give him a rag.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.181
Get the Van ready,
but don't leave

25:17.183 --> 25:19.783
until the money is cleared,
in pocket.

25:20.952 --> 25:23.754
Smokey is waiting
at the money union.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.523
There's only 1200.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.191
That's all we're gonna get
from him.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.260
I'm on it.

25:49.881 --> 25:53.017
<i> -Amigo!</i> Don't make that face.

25:53.919 --> 25:53.918
I'm sorry you saw that.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.689
He was just one of those guys
who didn't believe me

25:58.691 --> 26:00.124
when I said I was serious.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.660
He could've believed me
from the start!

26:03.161 --> 26:05.195
And then that guy
that he called...

26:06.865 --> 26:08.899
He just needed
a little convincing, right?

26:09.601 --> 26:10.801
Go on, sit.

26:14.673 --> 26:15.839
Ah, come on!

26:17.876 --> 26:19.777
You don't need to be nervous,
okay?

26:21.079 --> 26:23.247
Alright? It doesn't
have to go like that.

26:23.748 --> 26:24.815
No.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.350
This is just...

26:28.053 --> 26:29.653
A business transaction, right?

26:32.123 --> 26:35.693
You just need to understand...

26:39.898 --> 26:41.231
That I am serious.

26:57.248 --> 26:58.349
Elena!

27:11.196 --> 27:12.863
Hey!

27:15.367 --> 27:16.367
What are you doing?

27:16.369 --> 27:17.868
What?

27:17.870 --> 27:19.770
Did they touch you?

27:19.772 --> 27:21.038
What?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.076
Did they touch you?

27:26.078 --> 27:27.411
They drugged us...

27:27.979 --> 27:29.780
I was numb all over...

27:30.749 --> 27:33.017
Manolito, what if it
did something to the baby?

27:33.785 --> 27:35.419
- What are you doing?
- -No!

27:36.721 --> 27:37.988
Elena!

27:40.225 --> 27:42.660
--<i> Manolo!</i>

27:58.209 --> 28:00.277
They're raping Elena, out there!

28:09.354 --> 28:12.122
-Hey!
-Hey! Don't be stupid, chapin!

28:15.927 --> 28:17.361
Fuck!

28:43.288 --> 28:44.354
Elena!

28:59.003 --> 29:00.838
I can help you. I'm a--

29:00.840 --> 29:02.139
what?

29:06.311 --> 29:07.444
Are you fucking crazy?

29:07.446 --> 29:09.480
- They will kill you!

29:11.750 --> 29:13.984
What good will you be
to your wife then?

29:25.830 --> 29:25.829
Hi.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.068
I'm here on behalf
of Laurel barbel.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.205
She's running to represent
your council district

29:35.207 --> 29:36.373
in the upcoming election.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.209
Oh.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.845
Let me tell you
what Laurel stands for.

29:41.847 --> 29:44.948
Laurel's on record as being
an advocate of both

29:44.950 --> 29:49.153
the protect Arizona now and the
support your law enforcement

29:49.155 --> 29:51.555
and safe neighborhood acts.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.424
So... I see you got a child.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.960
One of the things
Laurel loves is family.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.230
She loves fighting
on behalf of family units.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.332
I won't take up
any more of your time.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.535
I'll just leave some literature
in your box.

30:04.537 --> 30:05.803
Thank you.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.538
Can I ask...

30:07.540 --> 30:09.907
Who did you vote for,
in the last election?

30:09.909 --> 30:11.508
We're new to the neighborhood,

30:11.510 --> 30:14.444
so we weren't actually here
during the last voting.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.512
Oh, I see!

30:18.917 --> 30:20.050
Um...

30:21.352 --> 30:23.520
I won't bother you anymore...

30:23.522 --> 30:24.855
So I can count on your vote?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.090
Yeah, definitely.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.826
-Okay.
-Okay, thanks.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.635
Today, instead of food,
you get to look at this.

32:54.205 --> 32:55.973
Tomorrow we want answers.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.741
Cash or phone calls.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.128
Okay, okay, okay...

33:18.130 --> 33:19.529
Up, up, up.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.218
We're gonna die in this room.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.559
My wife.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.765
<i> Elena didn't wanna come.</i>

34:00.705 --> 34:04.041
<i> I promised her</i>
<i> that we would be okay.</i>

34:08.478 --> 34:10.080
<i> She's pregnant,</i>

34:11.649 --> 34:14.451
<i> and she's gonna die here,</i>
<i> because of me.</i>

34:26.597 --> 34:28.331
We're gonna die here.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.271
No one's gonna die.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.806
I can get the cops here,

34:39.243 --> 34:40.677
bust us all out.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.152
I write for the <i> Arizona current.</i>

35:16.881 --> 35:18.748
Whatever it is you're brewin',

35:18.750 --> 35:20.884
no one here is drinkin',<i> cerote!</i>

35:23.321 --> 35:25.555
He's gonna get us
all out of here.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.157
You're a journalist, right?

35:29.393 --> 35:30.894
Who the fuck are you?

35:38.369 --> 35:39.803
I'm a journalist.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.738
And he's gonna
bring the police.

35:44.709 --> 35:45.876
It's not what you think.

35:47.712 --> 35:50.814
I'm three months into
going undercover in Mexico,

35:52.450 --> 35:55.352
to buy a cross from a coyote

35:57.188 --> 36:00.524
who's involved in
a human smuggling ring.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.893
What does that mean?

36:02.895 --> 36:05.695
It means, if they let me
make a phone call,

36:05.697 --> 36:07.264
there's someone
waiting to trace it,

36:07.266 --> 36:11.701
and put these guys' faces on
every front page in the country.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.837
You've been here for four days

36:14.839 --> 36:16.673
while I'm being roughed up
downstairs

36:16.675 --> 36:18.175
and you haven't told anyone?

36:18.177 --> 36:20.877
I wanted to expose more people,
bigger people.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.312
Fuck.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.680
It's over.

36:24.582 --> 36:26.716
They bust the house,
we all walk out free.

36:30.888 --> 36:33.223
We lock the bad guys up!

36:36.594 --> 36:38.261
<i> Fantastico!</i>

36:44.835 --> 36:47.437
They'll knock those <i> putos</i>
over the head,

36:47.439 --> 36:51.208
but while this guy goes back to
his nice little house downtown

36:51.210 --> 36:53.210
and washes this costume off,

36:54.512 --> 36:58.281
you and me, we're gonna be
in a real fucking prison,

37:00.284 --> 37:03.987
waiting, until they send us back
to where we all came from.

37:05.556 --> 37:06.957
But you'll be alive!

37:08.492 --> 37:09.659
Will I?

37:11.295 --> 37:13.830
You may not be able to relate
to that, journalist,

37:15.566 --> 37:17.534
but there's a reason
we left our homes.

37:22.773 --> 37:25.442
I go back to tegucigalpa, papa,

37:26.811 --> 37:28.812
and they're gonna
chop my head off.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.881
There's a contract
on my head there.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.353
There's a contract
on your head here.

37:44.629 --> 37:45.929
Did you hear what he said?

37:47.632 --> 37:49.032
He can get us out of here!

37:51.469 --> 37:52.836
It's not all about you!

37:52.838 --> 37:54.738
Don't talk to me
about what I want!

37:55.373 --> 37:57.540
You wanna stop the love session
going on with your girl,

37:57.542 --> 37:59.009
that's what you want!

37:59.577 --> 38:01.344
But it ain't about you either,
<i> cerote!</i>

38:04.915 --> 38:08.351
Rafa's brother trying to wire
money from San Salvador, right?

38:09.521 --> 38:13.390
And your sister is working
on rounding up some cash, no?

38:13.392 --> 38:16.760
My cousin's driving money over
from Kansas City.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.762
He'll be in Phoenix in two days.

38:22.767 --> 38:24.000
You wanna get sent back?

38:27.471 --> 38:28.505
Speak up!

38:28.507 --> 38:29.639
Now.

38:31.642 --> 38:32.709
No.

38:43.688 --> 38:46.389
Thanks for the noble crusade,

38:46.391 --> 38:49.793
for the rights of the poor
<i> centroamericanitos!</i>

38:50.795 --> 38:52.729
But we don't want a crusade.

38:52.731 --> 38:55.799
We don't want new laws.
We don't wanna be in the papers.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.368
We want a life.

38:59.937 --> 39:02.672
I'm walking out of here
in two days, papa.

39:03.607 --> 39:06.042
I'm never going back to tegus.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.044
Never.

39:09.580 --> 39:10.980
You keep your mouth shut.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.052
When is the police coming?

40:37.535 --> 40:39.135
You wanna get sent back?

40:45.843 --> 40:47.177
I don't like it here.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.620
I don't like it here either,
Antonio.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.253
They put a phone in my hand,

41:31.889 --> 41:34.123
I'm splitting this house
wide open.

41:43.667 --> 41:44.934
Six months ago...

41:47.137 --> 41:49.839
I got a call
from my cousin from Mexico.

41:53.677 --> 41:56.212
Says he's in trouble.
Says he needs money.

41:59.550 --> 42:00.717
It was weird.

42:02.152 --> 42:05.288
I hadn't seen him
or talked to him

42:05.290 --> 42:06.789
since we were, like, eight.

42:08.225 --> 42:09.726
I hung up.

42:11.829 --> 42:14.063
Two days later,
they call me again...

42:17.167 --> 42:18.935
I don't know
what they were doing to him,

42:18.937 --> 42:20.303
but the screams were...

42:24.174 --> 42:27.243
They had me.
I would've paid anything!

42:30.147 --> 42:31.748
The line cut,

42:33.284 --> 42:36.052
and they didn't have enough time
to ask for anything.

42:46.664 --> 42:49.299
You know what's gonna happen
to me if someone talks, yeah?

43:33.777 --> 43:34.644
Come on!

43:41.752 --> 43:42.752
Come.

44:13.251 --> 44:17.687
What's a guy like you doing,
trying to get into America?

44:19.123 --> 44:20.957
I mean, did you have a job?

44:23.395 --> 44:27.397
I used to deliver booze bags
mama made at the house.

44:28.265 --> 44:30.767
So, your mama made you
the bag bitch,

44:30.769 --> 44:32.969
so everyone would think
you had a job. Cute.

44:34.138 --> 44:36.406
- It was a job.
- -Mm.

44:37.007 --> 44:38.975
It was a job?
So where's all your money?

44:40.244 --> 44:41.711
Where's all your money?

44:42.413 --> 44:43.279
Huh?

44:43.281 --> 44:46.749
-Why did you have to leave?
-I...

44:50.689 --> 44:51.988
Come on!

44:51.990 --> 44:53.856
What would possess
a guy like you

44:53.858 --> 44:55.224
to make that journey?

44:56.226 --> 44:59.128
My mama thought I could
send some money back,

44:59.130 --> 45:01.898
so we could...

45:01.900 --> 45:02.999
Mama sent you.

45:04.201 --> 45:06.002
Mama sent you.

45:06.004 --> 45:07.336
What did they say back home?

45:08.138 --> 45:09.405
"This guy is going to <i> El norte?"</i>

45:10.174 --> 45:10.173
"This guy?"

45:12.142 --> 45:13.810
How the fuck did you
even make it here?

45:28.292 --> 45:29.992
I can't call home!

45:31.495 --> 45:35.098
If I call,
everything was for nothing.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.201
The train.

45:40.337 --> 45:42.338
The desert. That room!

45:45.075 --> 45:47.510
If I call,
it would be like if I failed.

45:48.445 --> 45:51.114
Again.

45:51.448 --> 45:53.983
You know what I'm gonna do,
for you?

45:55.252 --> 45:57.186
I'm gonna call your mama myself.

45:58.355 --> 46:01.090
And I'm gonna tell her
that you're dead,

46:02.092 --> 46:03.526
and that you failed,

46:04.495 --> 46:05.962
right to the end.

46:10.801 --> 46:12.769
Alright, we gotta start
clearing this room!

46:13.537 --> 46:16.506
Now, some of you have got leads
that we need to finalize.

46:20.811 --> 46:22.044
Who wants to go first?

46:29.853 --> 46:30.920
Tegus!

46:32.356 --> 46:33.923
We got an address
for your cousin.

47:45.062 --> 47:46.495
What's happening?

47:47.397 --> 47:48.631
They're onto him!

47:55.172 --> 47:56.405
Let's go.

48:39.316 --> 48:40.549
Did something happen?

48:42.252 --> 48:43.319
No.

48:46.423 --> 48:48.090
So you think...

48:48.458 --> 48:50.393
San Diego's gonna come
through for you?

48:51.228 --> 48:52.628
Yeah. I... I think...

48:53.931 --> 48:55.031
Uh...

48:57.100 --> 48:58.334
Did you change your mind?

49:00.137 --> 49:01.504
About what?

49:07.577 --> 49:09.178
Let's make a phone call.

49:11.181 --> 49:12.348
Right.

49:20.424 --> 49:22.158
Here! Let's call.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.362
Let's go in the other room.

49:35.038 --> 49:36.439
Why don't you write about this?

49:43.313 --> 49:44.647
That's one down!

49:46.149 --> 49:48.384
Silo's gonna love that.

49:48.386 --> 49:50.219
You're the one
who picks up the <i> pollos!</i>

49:51.321 --> 49:53.422
Maybe I should let you
tell your cousin

49:53.424 --> 49:56.292
how you picked up a fucking
reporter from the <i> current,</i>

49:56.294 --> 49:58.361
and nearly put us all
on the front page!

49:59.262 --> 50:00.730
You wrap that shit up!

50:38.668 --> 50:39.635
Psst!

50:40.237 --> 50:41.437
Rafa!

50:49.446 --> 50:51.781
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

51:23.346 --> 51:24.580
Stop!

51:27.717 --> 51:30.219
You stay off of me,<i> cerote!</i>

51:33.490 --> 51:35.424
We left for a reason too.

51:39.563 --> 51:41.797
I didn't want my baby
growing up in a place

51:41.799 --> 51:43.732
where she had to be scared
all the time.

51:52.209 --> 51:54.777
We left
because of bastards like you.

53:14.324 --> 53:15.424
I'll work...

53:16.593 --> 53:17.760
Huh?

53:18.795 --> 53:20.296
I'll do whatever.

53:22.199 --> 53:23.365
Anything.

53:24.534 --> 53:24.533
My wife.

53:26.303 --> 53:28.771
You have to promise
that she's gonna be okay.

53:29.573 --> 53:30.573
You'll work.

53:32.542 --> 53:33.876
Why didn't I think of that?

53:34.511 --> 53:35.778
Of course!

53:36.947 --> 53:37.813
You'll work!

53:38.982 --> 53:41.584
You can trim my hedge!

53:42.519 --> 53:45.854
Or mow my lawn,
or wash my car...

53:46.523 --> 53:48.657
How about you wipe my ass
after I take a shit?

53:51.294 --> 53:52.628
That's what I need.

53:52.630 --> 53:54.563
Not your fucking work!

53:55.465 --> 53:58.367
Maybe I should just shoot you,
and put your wife to work!

53:58.369 --> 54:00.502
She can make me some money.
Let's go ask elenita.

54:00.504 --> 54:02.338
- I don't have anything!

54:02.340 --> 54:03.973
What do you want me to do?

54:03.975 --> 54:05.774
Did they do this to...

54:13.016 --> 54:15.484
You got two choices,
you motherfucker!

54:15.486 --> 54:18.921
You either pay, or you end up
wrapped in plastic,

54:19.656 --> 54:21.557
with mister newspaperman.

54:21.559 --> 54:22.591
- Huh?
- -Wyler!

54:24.027 --> 54:25.294
Wyler!

54:26.396 --> 54:27.663
Silo.

54:34.871 --> 54:36.338
Yeah?

54:36.340 --> 54:37.773
<i>You cashing me out this Sunday?</i>

54:37.775 --> 54:40.376
Yeah, no, I know
i said by the weekend, but...

54:40.378 --> 54:42.044
<i>You're losing</i> pollos <i> out there!</i>

54:42.046 --> 54:44.013
You know how this happens!

54:44.015 --> 54:46.715
Some of these guys
have just been here two days!

54:46.717 --> 54:48.851
You take the backend,

54:48.853 --> 54:51.387
how I handle the middle
is up to me.

54:51.389 --> 54:53.689
<i> There has to be a backend,</i>
<i> that's the point!</i>

54:53.691 --> 54:56.825
<i>We got 22 more coming, who will</i>
<i> be dropped at your house.</i>

54:56.827 --> 54:58.794
You take them to chino's,
or some other house!

54:58.796 --> 55:00.863
Stall them in the fucking desert
for all I care!

55:00.865 --> 55:02.498
<i> Don't tell me</i>
<i> where to drop them!</i>

55:02.500 --> 55:03.932
-Fine.
<i> -You're cashing me out,</i>

55:03.934 --> 55:05.668
<i> and they're getting dropped</i>
<i> at your house!</i>

55:05.670 --> 55:06.902
Fine!

55:11.608 --> 55:13.909
You told him
about the fucking reporter.

55:15.345 --> 55:17.846
What I tell silo or
don't is none of your business.

55:17.848 --> 55:19.615
Everything that happens
in this house

55:19.617 --> 55:20.783
is my fucking business!

55:21.785 --> 55:23.052
Silo knows.

55:23.653 --> 55:27.056
Silo knows what i
fucking put in his pocket.

55:28.091 --> 55:29.558
Yeah?

55:29.560 --> 55:32.961
He ain't happy with what you
been putting there lately.

55:33.530 --> 55:34.830
Or how.

55:35.899 --> 55:37.933
He needs someone
to do what needs to be done

55:37.935 --> 55:40.536
to get these <i> pesos</i>
from these <i> pollos,</i>

55:42.038 --> 55:43.972
not someone
with a nice button-up shirt,

55:45.375 --> 55:48.010
that sides with
the spick bitches...

55:50.447 --> 55:53.048
They could be fucking niggers
for all I care.

55:56.086 --> 55:58.420
You don't pay up
when he shows up,

55:59.889 --> 56:03.759
the niggers are takin' over.

56:18.141 --> 56:19.842
Oh, hey! There you are!

56:24.714 --> 56:25.781
I've been looking for ya.

56:26.416 --> 56:26.415
Yeah...

56:28.518 --> 56:31.120
They're just saying that
they're having a barbecue...

56:31.122 --> 56:32.588
Next Friday?

56:32.590 --> 56:32.588
Friday evening.

56:32.590 --> 56:35.791
They were saying we should
come over.

56:36.993 --> 56:39.161
- Be great to see you!
-Oh!

56:39.729 --> 56:41.096
That's long overdue!

56:42.432 --> 56:43.899
- Great!
-Yeah.

56:44.701 --> 56:46.001
Great.

56:46.003 --> 56:47.836
- Alright! Here.
- -Friday, right?

56:47.838 --> 56:49.605
Yeah, Friday evening.

56:50.006 --> 56:51.407
- How's it going?
- -Good.

56:52.041 --> 56:53.175
Good to see you, then.

57:04.554 --> 57:06.522
What the fuck
are you doing over there?

57:07.490 --> 57:09.925
What the fuck
were you doing over there?

57:09.927 --> 57:11.827
Their dog came over, wyler!

57:12.896 --> 57:14.897
I thought it was better
than them coming over!

57:15.732 --> 57:18.066
You said we had to act normal,
right?

57:19.836 --> 57:23.172
--I wanna be normal, wyler!

57:24.174 --> 57:26.642
What are we doing?
Look what's in our house!

57:26.644 --> 57:28.043
-Kay, don't start...
-Good morning!

57:28.045 --> 57:28.977
Don't!

57:34.684 --> 57:35.851
Kay!

57:36.519 --> 57:37.986
Kay!

57:37.988 --> 57:39.154
Would you listen to me?

57:50.733 --> 57:52.167
You told me this was it.

57:52.169 --> 57:53.602
That's enough!

57:55.738 --> 57:57.639
Look, I have no choice.

57:58.074 --> 58:00.876
I have to take every miserable
fucker out of that room,

58:00.878 --> 58:02.978
one by one, and squeeze...

58:03.646 --> 58:05.881
And if there's no juice,
then I have to cross 'em out!

58:05.883 --> 58:07.483
I don't wanna be here for that.

58:14.257 --> 58:15.958
I'm taking Taylor.

58:31.575 --> 58:34.810
<i> The number you have reached</i>
<i> is not in service,</i>

58:34.812 --> 58:37.179
<i> -please check the number and--</i>
-Tony!

58:39.649 --> 58:43.218
I swear to fucking god, you dial
that number one more time...

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.199
Good morning.

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:06.201
I don't think so.

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:08.971
You see...

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:11.373
Nobody showed this morning.

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:14.176
What the fuck?

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:18.113
I don't know,
you talked to them yourself!

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.382
I don't know. What happened?

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:22.317
You fucking tell me
what happened!

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.286
Listen! Let me call them,

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.288
there's gotta be
some type of a problem,

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.689
like a setback.

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:28.824
A fucking setback!

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:31.660
Good idea. Let's call. Hm?

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:43.772
- <i> Hello.</i>
- Luis!

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:44.973
What the fuck, man?

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.076
No, it's not like that!
You don't...

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.747
You don't fucking get
where they got me, you asshole!

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:54.716
You say you gonna be there
at some time, you get there!

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.218
<i> I couldn't get the money...</i>

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.186
This is not the dentist!

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:00.889
- Listen to him, Luis!
- -Listen to me!

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:02.724
Just fucking listen!

01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:05.327
You were not there!

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:07.829
- Do what they say!
- -I don't give a fuck!

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:10.432
I do not care
how fucking sorry...

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:10.432
Listen to me!

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:14.836
Then listen
to your fucking cousin!

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.705
Primo,
i fucking need your help!

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.375
You fucking do what they--

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:26.415
shh...

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:32.154
Good... now...

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:35.123
Tomorrow.

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:37.192
- Same place.
- -<i> Okay.</i>

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:38.360
7:30.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.772
Your last plan
didn't work out so good.

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:58.907
They're not fucking around,
we gotta...

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.348
It doesn't look like your plan
worked out so good, either.

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:15.891
Get me up there! Maybe we can
leave from the roof.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:18.059
Maybe we can
climb over the walls.

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:19.861
And I can go get the women...

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:21.062
What if they come in?

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:31.406
What happens when there's
no more fingers to break?

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.415
Get up there.

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.319
Pedro.

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:56.097
It's working.

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:02.304
- Shh, shh.

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:05.507
Take this.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.514
Just a little bit more!
That's it!

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:15.884
--Shh!

01:04:15.886 --> 01:04:17.152
That's it.

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.473
There's nothing.

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:40.342
It's just an attic,
it's all closed in!

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:41.977
-It doesn't go anywhere.
-Are you sure?

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:43.645
There's nothing. There's no way!

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:46.915
Shh! Shh!

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:22.584
Rafa.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.087
Rafa!

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:29.925
Let's go, man!

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:30.992
Your cousin's waiting!

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.598
The fuck, you wanna stay?

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.369
Today's the day!

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.372
You wanna leave, right?

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:46.141
You're not
fucking acting like it!

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:05.593
Get down.

01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:07.095
Hey!

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:08.330
Get down from there!

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:09.731
Come on, come down!

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:13.702
Hold this.

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:20.675
I found something.

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.382
- Hey, get down!

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.150
Elena!

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:08.723
Maria, where is Elena?
Where is Elena?

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:17.732
Shut your face!

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.402
Where is Elena, Maria? <i> Señora!</i>

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:22.337
Maria!

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:24.039
<i> Where is Elena?</i>

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:28.576
Maria!

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:33.748
It's coming off!

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.351
Make sure it doesn't fall!

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:41.356
Grab it in the middle.

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:44.592
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.164
Wait!

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:52.133
-I can't leave Elena here.
-In the middle.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.539
-We can't leave without Elena!
-Wait. Wait, fuck!

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:01.142
It's too small.
We're never gonna fit there!

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:03.812
We gotta break it.

01:08:03.814 --> 01:08:05.380
They're gonna hear us.

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:07.182
Take too long for us
to sneak out!

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.483
- Back off!
- -Wait!

01:08:08.485 --> 01:08:09.784
They're gonna hear us!

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:11.786
They're gonna hear us.

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:13.555
And then what?

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:16.091
We need a diversion.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.795
We need to make a big noise
somewhere else

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.596
to cover the sound
of the window breaking.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.865
I can't leave Elena here,
please.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.568
There's a mirror
in the bathroom.

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:30.205
Out in the hall.

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:33.741
He's right. There's a mirror,
in this bathroom.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:36.711
If we break it, it'll cover the
sound of the window breaking.

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:40.782
I'll break it.

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.853
He's right.
I was in there before.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.822
I know. I saw you with the black
fucker before they killed paolo.

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.890
We'll break the window in here,
and you'll give us up!

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:54.696
'Cause they put me
on a hit to kill a guy.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.633
I couldn't do that.

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.502
So I fled.

01:09:01.636 --> 01:09:02.837
I would've killed back home,

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.738
there would've been
no reason to flee.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.408
The reporter wasn't me.

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:14.249
Listen.

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:16.850
I get them to put me
in that bathroom,

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.187
we need to sync.

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:22.724
I'll flush the toilet so you
can hear it through the wall,

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.560
we count to five,
and I smash that mirror

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:26.828
while you break the window
in here.

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:28.930
On the beat after five.

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:32.200
Flush. And five.

01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:35.904
They're gonna kill you.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.939
They'll rough me up.

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:42.609
I got it coming,
and I seen worse.

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:45.212
You wait for me.

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:12.674
Good news!
Finally, somebody listened.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.976
The wire came through
from his cousin.

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:17.979
Just like that,
he will never see us again.

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:23.918
Okay,<i> pollos!</i>

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:27.488
The hourglass has been tipped.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.823
It's check-out time!

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.229
Manolito!

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:36.598
Come here.

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:50.478
Come.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.646
Here.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.828
Your little offer
got interrupted last time.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:08.896
It's time we continue it.

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:10.798
Hm?

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:22.410
Oh, tegus...

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.513
Tegus!

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:44.932
Your fuck-head cousin called.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.501
He's on his way.

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:49.604
But he says
he's only got half the cash.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:53.841
What can I say?

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:15.063
Does no one there hear about
what happens to wetbacks here?

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:16.564
Fucking <i> señor?</i>

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.734
There needs to be new blood!

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:21.836
You should've paid up long ago!

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.705
- Silo needs to see how the--
-hey!

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:39.921
What, you think this
is how it's done?

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:41.923
I was gonna get him
to call someone,

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:43.124
get this shit over with!

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.125
So, did he call someone?

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:59.540
You fuckers got mixed up with
the wrong coyote, this week!

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:08.082
-We could break it.
-They'll hear us if we break it!

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:15.823
-No!

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:17.692
Back off,<i> cerotes!</i> Back off!

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:22.830
You think you can leave me alone
to hold the wood before,

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:24.799
and that I'll just let you
waltz out, now?

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:27.568
He carried you the whole time,

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:30.972
and you won't even wait
15 minutes for him to come back?

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:38.679
We wait! We wait.

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:44.018
When they come back in,
with him or not,

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:50.091
I'll beg into that washroom,
and we go for flush-and-five.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:53.795
If you fuckheads think
I'm gonna take the fall for you,

01:13:53.797 --> 01:13:55.196
then you don't know me!

01:13:55.198 --> 01:13:57.532
If you don't settle up with me
right now,

01:13:57.534 --> 01:13:59.934
then your wife is gonna be
fucking strangers

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.469
on east Van buren.

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:04.172
She's gonna pay us off
one sucked dick at the time,

01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:06.040
that's how we're gonna
settle this, you understand?

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.475
She's gonna suck dick
right here!

01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:09.977
Manolo!

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:12.180
Elena!

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.584
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:14:16.586 --> 01:14:20.188
Talk, talk, talk... that's all
you fucking do, is talk!

01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:23.124
Don't you move!

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:26.828
Put the fucking knife down,
what is wrong with you?

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:28.863
I'll take this one.

01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:31.165
You stand in the fucking corner!

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:36.170
Move back!

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.574
Big fucking mistake!

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:47.014
You tell me you can't think
of someone to call now, right?

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:48.816
Dial the fucking phone!

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:51.152
-I don't know who to call!
-Dial the fucking phone!

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:52.954
--Dial!

01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:55.857
-Dial the fucking number!
-I don't know who to call!

01:14:55.859 --> 01:14:57.625
- You fucking...

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:03.164
Manolo!

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.945
- Silo's coming at noon?
-It doesn't matter.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:20.214
We gotta get this house clean
before he gets here.

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:22.216
Fuck that shit! We gotta go now!

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:24.151
Put him off a few more days.
He keeps--

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:25.152
wyler!

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.724
Alright.

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:32.560
We need money.
We squeeze until the morning.

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:32.560
We know the rat will pay!

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:37.665
Alright, we get his money
tonight, and leave by sunrise.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.167
We need some water!
I need to get next door--

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:42.970
what the fuck?

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.673
I can't feel...

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:48.209
I need water, I need--

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.249
- I need water.
-You. Come.

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:58.219
Come on! You like to talk?

01:15:58.854 --> 01:15:59.987
It's time to talk. Come on!

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:09.664
Pedro!

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.337
You said
i was gonna be okay!

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.173
Hey, pedrito.

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:21.642
Do you know why you told me
about the reporter?

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:24.845
It's because you're a "gimme",
that's what you were born to be.

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:27.782
You don't wanna call home,
but you don't have to worry,

01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:30.217
because everyone there
expects you to! Right?

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:34.655
Call your mama, and tell her
that I'm about to kill you.

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:51.939
You're still here.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:57.678
No more waiting, chapin.

01:17:01.249 --> 01:17:04.051
You said I was gonna be okay.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.221
I told you, I can't call.

01:17:07.223 --> 01:17:09.890
I don't give a fuck
what you said!

01:17:09.892 --> 01:17:11.826
I don't give a fuck
what you think!

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.395
So call.

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.342
I can't leave her here.

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:35.316
You're gonna have
to choose, papa.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.954
Her.

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:43.024
Or you and her.

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.395
And me, and...

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:57.672
I'm sorry.

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:42.016
- <i> Hello?</i>
- Hello!

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:51.425
<i> We didn't get to choose</i>
<i> any of it, did we?</i>

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:57.998
We didn't get to choose

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.178
we didn't get to choose

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.348
if we were able
to kill in cold blood

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:30.364
we didn't get to choose...

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:36.437
If we were born in a place that
sold all-you-can-eat buffets,

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:41.542
or if we were born in a place...

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:45.546
Where we couldn't afford
frijoles.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:54.321
What we didn't choose,
that's what shaped us...

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:57.992
Made us who we are.

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.129
Being locked up in this room

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.231
is the smallest thing
this world ever did to us.

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:11.505
<i>If we have anything left inside,</i>

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.475
<i> anything,</i>

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.113
<i> from when we left</i>

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:22.183
and we walked thousands of miles
into the unknown...

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:27.021
For our families...

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.530
<i> Then there are no walls,</i>

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.334
<i> and there's no doors,</i>

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:46.874
<i>just like there was no borders,</i>
<i> or no laws, to keep us in.</i>

01:20:58.987 --> 01:20:58.986
Pedro!

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.057
- <i> -¡Cabron!</i>

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.293
Fuck!

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:18.072
Pedro!

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.619
What if it's not him?

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:34.655
Then we're all dead.

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:52.473
- What the fuck are you doing?
- -It's fucking Pedro!

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.975
Jesus!

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:56.277
Get up off the fl...

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:16.130
On your knees!
On your fucking knees!

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.265
Everyone!

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.035
Down!

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:28.676
Fuck it! Get the hoods.

01:22:28.678 --> 01:22:30.377
Get the hoods, get the ties!

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:37.217
<i> Kay!</i>

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:39.053
Kay!

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:43.424
Fuck it!

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:20.761
Sit the fuck down!

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.617
T!

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:51.819
Town?

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:49.776
Kay?

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.360
Go.

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:20.741
Manolo, let's go.

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:32.386
Manolo!

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:36.823
Don't fucking move!

01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:39.326
You fucker!

01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:48.936
Brother! Let's go!

01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:55.310
