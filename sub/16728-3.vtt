WEBVTT

00:00.836 --> 00:03.555
I've got nothing going on except 48
hours from now I have to make decision

00:03.745 --> 00:05.336
that's gonna affect me
till the day that I die.

00:06.386 --> 00:09.006
I'd accepted that I
wouldn't have a child

00:09.046 --> 00:12.586
and now I have one inside of me.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.186
And you made that happen.

00:15.286 --> 00:18.006
Lily, tell me, if you were pregnant...

00:18.046 --> 00:19.306
To... to you?

00:19.406 --> 00:21.786
Yeah, yeah, to me. What
would you want to hear?

00:21.846 --> 00:23.626
I love you and...

00:23.726 --> 00:25.390
And I'll support you in any way I can.

00:26.391 --> 00:27.950
OK? I'm not going anywhere.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.026
Not as much cooking in
the promo as I expected.

00:30.126 --> 00:31.866
There'll be a montage of
different shots of you,

00:31.966 --> 00:33.706
but it will always go
back to the cooking.

00:33.766 --> 00:35.006
Great.

00:35.086 --> 00:37.706
Our research says that people
tuned in because it's Jack.

00:37.806 --> 00:39.546
Not because it's cooking,
not because it's food,

00:39.606 --> 00:40.826
it's because he's handsome.

00:40.926 --> 00:42.886
I trusted you and I believed you.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.066
Why didn't you tell me you
had no regard for what I think

00:45.126 --> 00:46.186
or what I want?

00:46.286 --> 00:49.226
Do you think it's going to
damage my profile at all?

00:49.286 --> 00:51.706
Oh, no, not at all.

00:51.806 --> 00:53.866
Eric has dropped his bundle,
so Jack's promo is dead.

00:53.966 --> 00:56.646
We're starting again. Put a
shirt on him and get him cooking.

00:56.686 --> 00:58.366
You made the promo go away.

00:58.406 --> 00:59.786
Yeah.

00:59.886 --> 01:02.546
From now on, let's just be
completely honest with each other.

01:02.606 --> 01:03.866
Yeah.

01:07.926 --> 01:10.386
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:10.486 --> 01:13.186
Yeah! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:13.246 --> 01:16.466
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh!

01:18.766 --> 01:24.026
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa!

01:24.086 --> 01:26.146
Yes!

01:28.846 --> 01:30.706
Hey, this is Pete. Leave a message.

01:30.766 --> 01:32.186
It's me. Listen to this.

01:32.286 --> 01:36.586
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:36.686 --> 01:41.226
I just want you to know that
they're coming up to 2.5 hours...

01:41.286 --> 01:43.226
Simone and Jack.

01:43.286 --> 01:45.066
I can't sleep.

01:45.166 --> 01:48.326
I can't leave my room.
It's sex terrorism!

01:48.386 --> 01:51.746
I am a victim of sex terrorism.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.286
If you don't hear from me for a while

01:53.386 --> 01:57.066
just send them in with
the tear gas and tasers.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.166 --> 02:22.466
You're getting it everywhere.

02:30.606 --> 02:33.066
I actually don't think I
can go on unless I have sex.

02:33.126 --> 02:34.746
I might actually die.

02:34.846 --> 02:37.066
What, do you breathe out
of your muff or something?

02:38.226 --> 02:40.026
It's been almost two weeks.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.426
It's like I'm in a Jane
Austen movie or something.

02:42.526 --> 02:44.226
He hasn't said anything to you, has he?

02:44.286 --> 02:45.786
No.

02:45.886 --> 02:49.146
Well, if you happen to be speaking
to him, could you maybe ask...

02:49.246 --> 02:51.786
- You ask him.
- I have!

02:51.886 --> 02:55.006
But every time he's like,
"I've got an early start,"

02:55.086 --> 02:58.706
or "I'm training a new chef,"
or "not on the traffic island."

02:58.766 --> 03:00.066
I'm going. Bye.

03:02.426 --> 03:03.586
Thanks.

03:03.646 --> 03:05.066
Some sample comments.

03:05.166 --> 03:08.546
Melissa from Western Australia,
"can he be the next bachelor?"

03:08.646 --> 03:12.106
Jan from Adelaide, "he's something
me and my daughter enjoy together."

03:12.166 --> 03:13.106
Ew.

03:13.206 --> 03:15.506
Glen from Hobart, "any
information about his orientation

03:15.566 --> 03:17.106
would be greatly appreciated."

03:17.206 --> 03:18.546
So, Jack's come out
of the gates at 'love'

03:18.606 --> 03:19.946
in the last audience research,

03:20.046 --> 03:21.866
whereas Eric has plateaued at 'neutral'.

03:21.966 --> 03:25.106
We want as much of Jack as we can
possibly get within a G rating,

03:25.206 --> 03:27.026
but contractually we
can't have less Eric,

03:27.126 --> 03:28.866
so we're looking for
content that unites them.

03:28.926 --> 03:30.386
Are you thinking studio content

03:30.486 --> 03:32.186
or could we possibly
do a location shoot?

03:32.286 --> 03:34.346
- Either.
- What about a cook-off?

03:34.406 --> 03:35.866
Like competitive Sushi rolling,

03:35.966 --> 03:37.666
potentially in traditional
Japanese attire.

03:37.766 --> 03:40.706
- I feel like I've seen it.
- Yoga. Jack could teach Eric yoga.

03:40.766 --> 03:42.026
Eric in downward dog is not an image

03:42.126 --> 03:43.746
I want to inflict on
myself or the world.

03:43.846 --> 03:45.926
- At the risk of getting too newsy...
- No, Dale.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.446
- What about a Canberra week?
- Dale.

03:48.526 --> 03:50.386
Jack and Eric in the nation's capital...

03:50.446 --> 03:51.706
Lily?

03:51.806 --> 03:54.466
There's always the
fitness challenge thing.

03:54.566 --> 03:56.706
You know, an interactive
lifestyle makeover.

03:56.766 --> 03:57.826
Keep going.

03:57.926 --> 04:00.946
Well, we could get them both to wear
branded step-it trackers for a week.

04:01.006 --> 04:03.306
All their activity will be recorded

04:03.406 --> 04:05.346
and the audience could compare it online

04:05.446 --> 04:07.646
and then the results will
be announced live on air.

04:07.746 --> 04:09.546
Do you wear those trackers
on the wrist or on the bicep?

04:09.606 --> 04:10.646
On the wrist, generally.

04:10.726 --> 04:12.346
- Can we talk about maybe...
- No.

04:12.446 --> 04:14.218
If you can keep Eric
well away from Lycra,

04:14.219 --> 04:15.479
I like the fitness challenge.

04:15.486 --> 04:17.346
OK, let's get to work.

04:17.446 --> 04:18.586
- OK.
- OK.

04:24.346 --> 04:27.666
So, the bill comes in... $400.

04:27.766 --> 04:30.346
- Bloody ridiculous. Off a $200 quote.
- Yeah, ridiculous.

04:30.446 --> 04:32.306
It takes him 20 minutes to do the job.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.026
Hey, Dad, I've got
to tell you something.

04:35.206 --> 04:36.186
What have you done?

04:36.286 --> 04:41.286
No, no, it's not bad, but it
might come as a bit of a surprise.

04:41.326 --> 04:46.126
Um... Actually I'm gonna be a dad.

04:49.006 --> 04:52.106
- Since when?
- Well, it's still early.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.666
Is it with Lily?

04:53.726 --> 04:55.226
No. What?

04:55.326 --> 04:58.786
What? No, no, no, not
with Lily. With Meredith.

04:58.846 --> 05:00.286
Which one's she again?

05:00.386 --> 05:02.426
The one from the cafÃ©
that I just moved in with.

05:02.486 --> 05:03.946
Yeah, of course. Yes.

05:05.766 --> 05:08.306
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

05:11.726 --> 05:14.466
- I still think of you as a kid.
- Yeah, so do I.

05:14.566 --> 05:16.946
But I'm the same age
you were when you had me.

05:17.046 --> 05:19.506
- Are you?
- Yeah.

05:19.606 --> 05:21.946
- God, it looks different, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

05:29.886 --> 05:31.706
It will be the best
thing you've ever done.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.066
You think?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.786
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was for me.
- Really?

05:35.886 --> 05:39.566
Because, I mean, to be
perfectly honest, Dad,

05:39.666 --> 05:41.306
you always just seemed
a little bit bored by it.

05:41.366 --> 05:43.826
Yeah, it's boring, but it's both.

05:43.926 --> 05:47.346
It's both boring and
amazing at the same time.

05:48.526 --> 05:50.786
- OK.
- Is Lily excited?

05:50.846 --> 05:51.986
Meredith.

05:53.966 --> 05:56.346
So, this is obviously just a mock-up,

05:56.446 --> 05:58.986
but there'll be a Jack
page and an Eric page,

05:59.086 --> 06:02.926
and the audience will be able
to track your calories burned,

06:02.966 --> 06:04.466
your heart rate...

06:04.566 --> 06:06.186
- Um, technical question.
- Yes?

06:06.246 --> 06:08.106
Uh... Just in terms of privacy,

06:08.206 --> 06:10.226
will the audience be able
to tell if we're, um...

06:11.326 --> 06:13.306
... Well, you know,
intimate with someone?

06:13.366 --> 06:15.946
Um... I...

06:16.046 --> 06:17.566
Just take it off before
you go to bed, mate.

06:17.666 --> 06:19.706
Might not be limited
to the bedroom, Jack.

06:21.566 --> 06:24.186
I'm kidding! I'm so kidding.

06:24.286 --> 06:26.706
Not really. Anyway, you
can take them off at night.

06:26.806 --> 06:30.186
Yeah, absolutely. So, if you
guys want to slip them on now...

06:30.286 --> 06:34.286
Um... No, Eric, you don't
have to take your shirt off.

06:34.366 --> 06:37.146
It's wrist.

06:37.246 --> 06:39.706
- It's wrist, yeah.
- Of course it is.

06:39.806 --> 06:43.426
Lily, would you mind
just popping it on there?

06:43.486 --> 06:44.426
Yep.

06:44.526 --> 06:48.466
Um... OK, so, if you just
want to look at the display,

06:48.566 --> 06:54.026
you should be able to see
steps taken, distance, calories,

06:54.086 --> 06:55.986
um... heart rate.

06:56.086 --> 06:58.646
Might be experiencing a minor
surge in that department right now.

07:00.206 --> 07:02.566
No, I'm kidding.

07:02.606 --> 07:04.286
I am so kidding. Not really.

07:04.326 --> 07:05.926
Anyway, continue, when you're ready.

07:07.526 --> 07:11.146
- He's pretty inappropriate.
- Hm. It's fine. He's just old school.

07:11.246 --> 07:12.926
Does Sasha know how he is around you?

07:13.026 --> 07:14.926
- I can handle it.
- But you shouldn't have to.

07:15.026 --> 07:16.866
Look, I don't wanna make
a situation out of it,

07:16.966 --> 07:19.826
and, yes, I know that
is how evil prospers,

07:19.926 --> 07:23.786
but it's Wednesday and I'm
facing five solid days of him,

07:23.846 --> 07:26.306
so congratulations, Evil.

07:26.366 --> 07:28.026
Anyway, are you home tonight?

07:28.126 --> 07:30.866
I was thinking of cooking
dinner for you and Simone.

07:30.926 --> 07:33.206
I think I, um... I have...

07:33.306 --> 07:36.506
Yeah, I've got a whole... bunch
of emails I have to get back to,

07:36.566 --> 07:40.386
so I might just leave you two to it.

07:40.486 --> 07:43.226
It's not uncomfortable, is
it? Having me at your place?

07:43.326 --> 07:45.866
No. No, no, no. No, no. Why would it be?

07:45.966 --> 07:49.066
It's just this past week
I've been thinking about you.

07:49.126 --> 07:51.226
Thinking about me?

07:51.326 --> 07:53.566
Thinking about it from your perspective.

07:53.666 --> 07:55.506
You have to work with me all day here,

07:55.606 --> 07:57.706
then to get me at your place as
well, it's a whole lot of Jack.

07:57.806 --> 08:00.226
I can handle a whole lot of J... Jack.

08:00.326 --> 08:02.706
Just if it's getting
annoying give me a sign.

08:02.806 --> 08:04.426
- See you tonight.
- OK.

08:06.766 --> 08:07.986
Bye.

08:09.486 --> 08:10.946
A whole lot of Jack.

08:11.046 --> 08:16.386
Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

08:20.326 --> 08:24.666
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa!

08:33.006 --> 08:34.866
Oh.

08:34.926 --> 08:36.926
Sorry.

08:37.025 --> 08:41.145
I have to be out of the house in
15 minutes, and you do too, Jack,

08:41.206 --> 08:42.666
so really you should hurry...

08:42.765 --> 08:44.866
- Lils!
- Lucas?

08:44.966 --> 08:48.826
I thought you were J... I...
didn't know you were in town.

08:48.926 --> 08:52.226
Just for one night.
Just for one night. Ah!

08:52.366 --> 08:54.386
- You're looking good, little Lil-lover.
- Thanks. You, too.

08:54.486 --> 08:56.066
I've been getting into
the interval training.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.466
Feeling the burn. Feeling the burn! Ah!

08:59.566 --> 09:01.286
- Good for you.
- Have you seen my watch?

09:01.366 --> 09:03.466
- It's really nice.
- Do you like it?

09:03.566 --> 09:05.066
- You can have it.
- Oh, that's OK.

09:05.126 --> 09:06.226
No, go on, take it. It's yours.

09:06.326 --> 09:08.786
Oh, do you mind if I use the bathroom?

09:08.846 --> 09:10.306
Go for it, Hillary Clinton.

09:21.266 --> 09:23.426
Psst. Is he gone?

09:25.126 --> 09:27.386
What the hell is going on?

09:28.966 --> 09:32.106
- I think I fell off the wagon.
- What happened to Jack?!

09:32.246 --> 09:35.346
Last night when I went to bed you two
were curled up on the couch together.

09:35.406 --> 09:36.386
I know.

09:36.486 --> 09:39.786
I thought it was all going
well, but then I don't know why,

09:39.886 --> 09:42.306
but Jack started going on
about things he had to check

09:42.406 --> 09:44.506
at the restaurant and getting up early,

09:44.566 --> 09:47.426
and he left and I was a bit upset.

09:47.526 --> 09:49.566
- So you booty-called Lucas?
- No.

09:49.666 --> 09:53.846
I swear, he just happened
to text and I responded.

09:55.086 --> 09:57.146
I honestly didn't think I
was gonna sleep with him.

09:57.246 --> 10:00.706
"In town. What's up? I mean,
besides me." Rocket emoji.

10:00.806 --> 10:05.866
I know it's terrible, but
actually, in the long run,

10:05.926 --> 10:07.066
I think it's gonna be good.

10:07.126 --> 10:09.026
How could it be good?

10:09.126 --> 10:12.866
Because it really clarified
that that is what I do not want.

10:12.966 --> 10:15.926
I think it was a bit like
I was driving recklessly

10:15.966 --> 10:18.466
and I almost had an accident,

10:18.566 --> 10:20.626
but it ended up being a good reminder

10:20.686 --> 10:22.306
of the importance of road safety.

10:22.406 --> 10:26.206
Simone, I think you had the
accident. The accident was loud.

10:26.306 --> 10:28.346
The accident left me with no hot water.

10:30.426 --> 10:32.206
Please don't say anything to Jack.

10:40.921 --> 10:42.641
So, everyone said living together

10:42.741 --> 10:44.281
would be either brilliant or terrible,

10:44.381 --> 10:45.921
but three weeks in it's kind of both.

10:49.461 --> 10:50.921
I'm sleeping.

10:51.021 --> 10:52.721
Libido-wise, there's
a definite imbalance,

10:52.821 --> 10:54.841
and some of her
opinions drive me mental.

10:54.941 --> 10:57.561
Because of the incredible amount
of evidence and documentation.

10:57.661 --> 10:59.961
Have you actually seen
footage of the moon landing?

11:00.061 --> 11:03.361
- Yes, tons of it.
- Well, why is the flag waving?

11:03.461 --> 11:06.081
Where's the wind on the moon?

11:06.181 --> 11:08.881
The no-sex thing I'd be worried about,

11:08.941 --> 11:09.881
but the moon landing...

11:09.981 --> 11:12.601
Oh, no, we do have sex, just
not as much as I thought.

11:12.701 --> 11:15.201
- No, when we have it, it's amazing.
- Oh, shut up.

11:15.301 --> 11:17.721
- Oh, it's the best sex of my life.
- Of your life?

11:17.821 --> 11:20.881
- Don't... I mean...
- The best sex of your life?

11:20.941 --> 11:22.241
I so regret saying that.

11:22.341 --> 11:25.641
Well, you were not the
best sex of my life either.

11:25.741 --> 11:28.481
But I would still like
to give you an award

11:28.541 --> 11:30.081
for the evening we spent together.

11:30.181 --> 11:31.781
- Thank you.
- Do you know what it is?

11:31.861 --> 11:33.521
- No.
- It's for turning up... participation.

11:33.581 --> 11:34.521
It's a participation award.

11:37.821 --> 11:39.881
Let me tell you about
the single biggest problem

11:39.941 --> 11:40.921
Meredith and I have had so far.

11:41.021 --> 11:42.481
I think that would be a good idea, yes.

11:42.581 --> 11:45.421
OK, so, she's got this
best friend, right?

11:45.461 --> 11:46.841
He's a dude. He's named Mitchell.

11:52.261 --> 11:54.281
- Your phone.
- OK.

11:59.181 --> 12:01.481
Hey. No, no, it's fine.

12:01.541 --> 12:02.781
And every time he rings,

12:02.861 --> 12:05.161
she goes outside to the very
back corner of the garden, right?

12:05.261 --> 12:08.201
Totally out of earshot, and they
always talk for over an hour.

12:08.301 --> 12:12.061
And last time she comes back in,
she's looking totally devastated,

12:12.161 --> 12:14.001
and she's never offered to
introduce me to him, not once.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.061
You never introduced me to
Meredith and I'm your best friend.

12:17.161 --> 12:18.201
- You've met her.
- When?

12:18.301 --> 12:21.881
- At the cafÃ©.
- She made me a coffee once or twice.

12:21.981 --> 12:23.681
And that was before I even
knew you two were together.

12:23.741 --> 12:25.361
That's not exactly how I'd choose

12:25.461 --> 12:26.961
to meet the mother of
my best friend's child.

12:27.021 --> 12:28.141
That's beside the point.

12:28.221 --> 12:30.201
Pretty direct correlation, but go on.

12:30.261 --> 12:32.161
But it's a worry.

12:32.261 --> 12:34.321
Right? This whole Mitchell
thing, that's a definite worry.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.481
I'd just do a group meet. Throw
them all in the room together.

12:38.581 --> 12:41.841
You know, if I see them together
I'll know if you should be worried.

12:41.901 --> 12:43.521
That's not comforting.

12:45.981 --> 12:48.241
So, that message I left you at 2am...

12:48.341 --> 12:51.721
- Oh, the Simone sex fest?
- Yeah. Turns out not Jack... Lucas.

12:51.821 --> 12:53.161
- Lucas?!
- Mm-hm.

12:53.261 --> 12:54.421
- Like, Cokehead Lucas?
- Yep.

12:54.521 --> 12:55.841
- What happened to the chef?
- Nothing.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.641
Apparently Simone is still dating Jack,

12:57.741 --> 12:59.521
but he went home a bit early that night,

12:59.621 --> 13:02.281
Simone felt a little bit
lonely for about two minutes,

13:02.381 --> 13:05.241
so she decided to rebound
with a five-hour sex fest.

13:05.301 --> 13:07.001
She's awesome.

13:07.061 --> 13:08.841
What am I supposed to do?

13:08.901 --> 13:10.161
Nothing. It's none of your business.

13:10.261 --> 13:13.561
Well, it is kind of my business,
seeing as she's my flatmate,

13:13.661 --> 13:15.961
he's my colleague and I introduced them.

13:17.461 --> 13:19.241
- Are you hot for him or something?
- What?

13:19.341 --> 13:20.801
- You heard me.
- No.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.521
- You are.
- I am not!

13:22.581 --> 13:24.481
No, I feel conflicted

13:24.581 --> 13:28.061
because if they implode,
I am right in the middle.

13:28.161 --> 13:30.161
And you want to sleep
with him just a little bit.

13:30.261 --> 13:31.801
- No.
- Don't you?

13:31.901 --> 13:34.701
No, OK, I'll acknowledge
Jack is attractive,

13:34.801 --> 13:37.121
but we would not be
compatible, I'm certain of it.

13:38.301 --> 13:41.121
- We'd be like 45% max.
- Oh, you've calculated?

13:43.041 --> 13:46.441
Our dispositions are kind
of similar, so that's 35%.

13:46.541 --> 13:48.601
Conversation's easy...
that's another 35%.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.601
Right.

13:49.661 --> 13:51.201
But he's really earnest

13:51.301 --> 13:55.061
and he also does often take
breaks for meditation time,

13:55.101 --> 13:57.961
which drags him right down to 45%,

13:58.061 --> 14:00.321
which is below sustainable
relationship levels.

14:00.421 --> 14:01.801
Yeah, you totally wanna sleep with him.

14:05.301 --> 14:07.641
Hi. Sorry, Mum, two secs. I'm just...

14:07.741 --> 14:09.561
No, it's fine... just when you get here

14:09.661 --> 14:11.801
take a close look at your father.

14:11.901 --> 14:13.841
- Why?
- Just take a close look.

14:13.901 --> 14:15.721
At anything in particular?

14:15.821 --> 14:17.961
I think he might have
had some work done.

14:18.021 --> 14:19.481
Work?

14:19.541 --> 14:22.321
Cosmetically. Huh? OK?

14:22.421 --> 14:25.881
I'm not gonna say any more.
Just let me know what you think.

14:27.261 --> 14:29.841
Dad, you were out of home at 17. I'm 31.

14:29.901 --> 14:31.521
Yeah, but that's not the point.

14:31.581 --> 14:33.721
Why? Why is that not the point?

14:33.781 --> 14:35.081
It's very different circumstances.

14:35.181 --> 14:38.521
- I can live independently, Dad.
- I mean a different era.

14:38.621 --> 14:41.841
I mean, I had to leave home. My
parents were from the depression.

14:41.941 --> 14:45.601
Your mother and I are much
more similar to you, culturally.

14:45.701 --> 14:48.881
Well, and looks-wise,
in your case, Tony.

14:48.981 --> 14:50.361
Pardon? Well...

14:50.461 --> 14:53.801
Lily certainly loves it at home.
I mean, she's always staying over.

14:53.901 --> 14:56.561
For about a night a month, then
she goes back to her own house.

14:56.661 --> 14:59.321
Still says she never gets a
better night's sleep than at home.

14:59.421 --> 15:01.121
- Don't you, Lil?
- That's true.

15:01.181 --> 15:03.241
You look very well rested, Tony.

15:03.301 --> 15:06.121
Extremely well rested.

15:06.181 --> 15:07.701
What's your secret?

15:07.801 --> 15:11.441
Well, I have been doing
a bit of mindfulness.

15:13.101 --> 15:16.881
And I bought a humidifier,
too, to put in the bedroom.

15:16.941 --> 15:18.441
Very effective.

15:18.541 --> 15:21.121
You know, you can actually
feel the difference.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.281
- Does it whiten your teeth?
- Mum.

15:23.341 --> 15:25.281
Just regular brushing, Mimi.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.641
I thought the point of these dinners

15:26.741 --> 15:30.081
was to pretend we were a nice,
normal, happy post-divorce family.

15:30.181 --> 15:32.001
Can we pretend a little
bit better, please?

15:32.101 --> 15:35.521
I am being nice. I'm
being very, very nice.

15:35.621 --> 15:40.081
I'm complimenting your
father. His teeth look lovely.

15:40.181 --> 15:42.881
- Blindingly lovely.
- Mum, come on.

15:42.981 --> 15:46.761
I reckon you could see them from space.

15:55.241 --> 15:56.901
Mum.

15:56.961 --> 15:58.461
Mum, I... no.

15:58.561 --> 16:02.701
All I'm saying is he
didn't look, like, fake.

16:02.801 --> 16:07.141
Oh, yes, so, you're actually
saying that he had good work done.

16:07.201 --> 16:08.181
No!

16:08.281 --> 16:11.701
No, seriously, should I
consider having some work done?

16:11.761 --> 16:13.381
No. Not at all.

16:13.441 --> 16:15.541
Hi, Mimi.

16:15.601 --> 16:17.421
Simone.

16:17.481 --> 16:20.821
Oh. Have you met Jack?

16:20.881 --> 16:23.141
No. Hello.

16:23.241 --> 16:24.961
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you.

16:25.001 --> 16:28.181
Oh. I love you on the show.

16:28.281 --> 16:30.781
I even downloaded Instagram
so I could follow you.

16:30.881 --> 16:32.181
- Mum.
- Well, I'll follow you back.

16:32.281 --> 16:36.381
Oh, no, I don't post anything,
I just, you know, look and like.

16:36.441 --> 16:38.101
Oh, OK, Mum, that's creepy.

16:38.201 --> 16:39.781
Now, Simone, you will tell me honestly,

16:39.881 --> 16:41.821
should I consider having some work done?

16:41.921 --> 16:44.681
- Oh, God.
- No, you're beautiful.

16:44.761 --> 16:47.381
You're too young for it.
How old are you... mid-40s?

16:47.441 --> 16:50.341
Oh, OK, Simone, marry him.

16:50.441 --> 16:53.341
What happens, sometimes when I look
in the mirror I just, I don't know,

16:53.401 --> 16:54.981
I just look a little bit angry.

16:55.041 --> 16:55.981
No, you don't.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.621
At most, you'd need
a little bit of Botox.

16:58.721 --> 17:01.241
- Simone!
- Just a little bit.

17:01.341 --> 17:04.861
It's not like you need it. I
personally love your wrinkles.

17:04.961 --> 17:08.540
- Oh, my God.
- What? I do.

17:08.641 --> 17:11.421
- Song-lines of your experience.
- Yes.

17:11.521 --> 17:15.141
And your face is singing
beautiful songs, Mimi.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.621
It's like an opera.

17:16.681 --> 17:20.340
OK, I should go.

17:32.841 --> 17:34.661
- Where is she?
- The bathroom.

17:35.821 --> 17:38.241
She is unbelievable.

17:38.341 --> 17:42.461
If someone asks you a
cosmetic surgery question

17:42.521 --> 17:45.101
it's always a must-lie situation.

17:45.161 --> 17:46.181
Everybody knows that.

17:46.281 --> 17:48.901
Actually, I wasn't lying.
Your mum is beautiful.

17:50.121 --> 17:52.821
- I can see...
- What?

17:53.921 --> 17:57.141
Just, I can see where you get it from.

18:02.101 --> 18:03.301
It's getting late.

18:15.411 --> 18:16.351
Pete.

18:16.451 --> 18:19.031
So, I did what you suggested... I
invited Mitchell to a group dinner.

18:19.091 --> 18:20.671
How'd it go?

18:20.771 --> 18:26.111
Pete, you should probably know that
Mitchell is more than an old friend.

18:27.431 --> 18:28.491
He's an ex.

18:29.771 --> 18:30.711
OK.

18:30.811 --> 18:36.311
Yeah, he's the ex I tried to have
a baby with for all those years.

18:38.531 --> 18:39.851
Oh.

18:39.891 --> 18:41.511
And apparently he'd love to meet me.

18:41.611 --> 18:44.211
So, we're gonna do a group dinner
tomorrow night. Do not cancel.

18:44.251 --> 18:46.911
I will be there. Are you OK?

18:47.011 --> 18:50.671
Yeah. I'm exhausted.
We had this massive D&M.

18:50.731 --> 18:53.071
I'm sorry I didn't say everything.

18:53.131 --> 18:56.431
It's just part of my history

18:56.531 --> 18:59.631
that I'm trying to
resolve before, you know...

19:01.491 --> 19:02.671
Sure.

19:02.771 --> 19:04.951
Have you tried cyberstalking him yet?

19:05.051 --> 19:06.791
I can't. I don't even
know his last name.

19:06.851 --> 19:09.871
What? Are you a total amateur?

19:09.971 --> 19:11.591
- What?
- Hang on.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.111
What are you doing?

19:14.151 --> 19:15.851
OK, his last name is Denham.

19:15.891 --> 19:17.491
What? How did you...

19:17.591 --> 19:21.431
Meredith only has one friend
called Mitchell on social media.

19:21.491 --> 19:24.111
And... Hang on.

19:24.171 --> 19:26.211
He's an investment banker.

19:27.491 --> 19:30.031
Mid-40s. He's hot.

19:30.091 --> 19:31.491
Jesus, who are you... Edward Snowden?

19:31.531 --> 19:34.351
This is embarrassingly basic, Pete.

19:34.451 --> 19:38.851
Clearly, him and Meredith did
a lot of travelling together.

19:38.951 --> 19:41.851
I'm not getting any of this. Is it
Denham as in, like, 'double denim'?

19:42.051 --> 19:44.571
He's way more corporate than I imagined.

19:44.671 --> 19:46.971
OK, I got it. I got
it. I'll call you back.

19:47.071 --> 19:50.011
And my role in those days
was more of an analyst

19:50.071 --> 19:51.471
across a whole range of areas,

19:51.551 --> 19:53.610
from commercial lending
to private equity.

19:53.613 --> 19:54.913
Hey. Coming to bed?

19:54.973 --> 19:56.253
Yeah. Yep.

19:57.653 --> 19:59.593
Pete...

19:59.693 --> 20:03.553
There's still a lot we have
to discover about each other,

20:03.653 --> 20:06.473
but let's just always
start from a place of trust.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.833
Of course. Yeah. No, I do trust you.

20:09.933 --> 20:12.033
Day to day it was mostly research.

20:12.133 --> 20:15.173
Crunching numbers, trying to
apply a means of common sense.

20:18.873 --> 20:20.833
Whoo!

20:20.893 --> 20:22.353
Ha!

20:22.453 --> 20:24.993
You know, for me there's no
better way to start the day

20:25.053 --> 20:27.273
than with a blast of endorphins.

20:27.373 --> 20:30.713
And there's no better
exercise than squats.

20:30.773 --> 20:32.713
What do you reckon? Let's do it.

20:33.813 --> 20:35.233
Whoo! Yeah.

20:35.293 --> 20:38.073
Feeling that.

20:38.173 --> 20:40.853
Keep low. You know, our
bodies were built for this.

20:43.393 --> 20:44.713
Oh, that's good.

20:47.493 --> 20:49.273
- Are we out?
- Out.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.433
Alice...

20:53.533 --> 20:58.073
... Just, uh... 25 more,
or 30 if you can, yeah?

20:58.173 --> 20:59.913
- OK.
- Yeah?

21:00.013 --> 21:02.473
Uh... This will edit together, won't it?

21:02.533 --> 21:03.953
Yeah. I hope this is heartburn.

21:05.393 --> 21:06.353
Ooh.

21:07.453 --> 21:09.393
And then straight into push-ups.

21:09.453 --> 21:12.313
Remember, elbows in, back strong.

21:12.373 --> 21:14.753
Alright.

21:14.813 --> 21:17.533
Ha-ha! Yeah!

21:20.753 --> 21:23.593
Just kiddin'!

21:23.693 --> 21:25.533
And then when you're
really feeling that,

21:25.573 --> 21:27.353
let's get that heart pumping with...

21:27.413 --> 21:29.273
... Sprints.

21:35.973 --> 21:37.813
Whoa. It's quite the routine, isn't it?

21:37.913 --> 21:41.873
It certainly is, Erica, but
is it translating into results?

21:41.973 --> 21:44.813
Well, right now we're
joined by trainer Phil

21:44.913 --> 21:48.273
for the final stage of our
step-it fitness challenge.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.713
- And cut.
- OK, great. Thanks, Erica.

21:50.813 --> 21:53.813
Now, if I can just grab Eric,
Jack and trainer Phil, I'll...

21:53.853 --> 21:54.873
Morning, Phil.

21:54.973 --> 21:56.833
So, we'll just play
that short package...

21:56.933 --> 21:58.913
I certainly hope you're
not referring to my package.

21:58.973 --> 22:01.593
Hey? Package!

22:01.693 --> 22:04.233
And then if you want to
come join Jack on the couch?

22:04.293 --> 22:07.033
Uh, you want to walk me through it?

22:07.093 --> 22:10.033
It... It's just walking to the couch.

22:10.093 --> 22:12.533
Putty in your hands, Lily.

22:12.573 --> 22:13.953
Putty.

22:14.053 --> 22:16.073
- Ha!
- I'll walk you through it, mate.

22:16.173 --> 22:18.833
- Eh?
- Come on, just around here, mate.

22:18.933 --> 22:21.713
- Oh. Oh, I'm right, mate.
- Are you, mate?

22:21.813 --> 22:23.993
- Yeah, I think I am.
- Good.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.993
Hang on, how do you
unstrap this thing, again?

22:27.093 --> 22:29.173
- Can you show me, mate?
- Where do...

22:32.933 --> 22:36.553
Mate, your cock is on my shoulder.

22:38.773 --> 22:41.233
- That's gold.
- There we go.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.993
No, I don't think he
was trying to throw you.

22:46.093 --> 22:48.113
Well, what was it? Some
sort of in-joke thing?

22:48.213 --> 22:49.753
- I think he was just trying to...
- Do you know what?

22:49.853 --> 22:51.313
I don't appreciate being
the butt of the joke

22:51.373 --> 22:53.373
in front of the entire crew, Lily!

22:55.493 --> 22:56.633
Eric...

22:58.133 --> 23:01.273
Jack was just doing what
you do to me all the time.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.913
What?!

23:03.013 --> 23:05.513
Well, you lean over
me, too. Just like that.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.073
Oh, come on, that's completely
different. You and me, we were...

23:10.133 --> 23:11.273
We're just joking around.

23:11.373 --> 23:14.553
Yeah, well, Jack was
just joking around, too.

23:16.733 --> 23:18.553
Lily, you and I have been
working together for years.

23:18.653 --> 23:21.953
I'd hope if you ever had
an issue you'd just say so!

23:23.853 --> 23:28.473
Alright, I'm saying so. It's an issue.

23:28.573 --> 23:31.593
Your sexually loaded jokes
make me uncomfortable.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.013
I'm sorry I didn't say anything earlier.

23:38.653 --> 23:40.073
Right.

23:42.453 --> 23:45.033
OK, well, shame to drop the segment.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.393
No, I don't want to drop the segment.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.113
No, no, you've made yourself very clear.

23:50.733 --> 23:51.753
Alice!

23:56.372 --> 23:59.387
I will get you guys back up
there and maybe you can do some...

23:59.426 --> 24:00.426
Hey

24:00.668 --> 24:04.403
Um... Sasha just called,
she's dropping the segment.

24:04.678 --> 24:08.248
It's just, um... The show's
running too long, so...

24:09.701 --> 24:10.508
I'm so sorry, Phil.

24:10.708 --> 24:13.500
We're still totally committed
to the summer bikini challenge.

24:13.578 --> 24:15.758
- It's fine.
- Thanks. Bye.

24:15.818 --> 24:17.238
I'm sorry.

24:17.298 --> 24:18.878
Don't you apologise.

24:18.978 --> 24:20.718
I had no idea the whole
segment would be canned.

24:20.843 --> 24:22.858
I loved what you just did.

24:24.178 --> 24:26.438
- Will there be repercussions?
- Maybe.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.298
But I don't care.

24:28.338 --> 24:30.598
Good. 'Cause neither do I.

24:40.838 --> 24:43.398
Problem. Problem. Massive problem.

24:43.458 --> 24:45.678
Jack was just a total hero with Eric

24:45.778 --> 24:50.038
and now I'm rethinking
our compatibility levels.

24:50.138 --> 24:52.798
I think they might be as high as 70%.

24:53.809 --> 24:55.398
Lil, you can just admit
you're hot for him,

24:55.498 --> 24:57.038
you don't need to pull
out the statistics.

24:57.098 --> 24:58.518
No, you don't understand.

24:58.618 --> 25:01.918
He just... he pulled this
total he for she moment.

25:02.018 --> 25:04.858
It was full-on Justin
Trudeau meets Obama,

25:04.958 --> 25:08.758
and he did it in front
of the entire crew.

25:08.858 --> 25:13.718
I didn't... I didn't know he had
that kind of integrity and courage.

25:13.818 --> 25:18.158
And, alright... I'll admit
it, he's ridiculously fuckable.

25:18.218 --> 25:19.398
He...

25:22.098 --> 25:24.678
- Oh, my God.
- What?

25:24.778 --> 25:27.038
I've gotta go. I'll call back.
I'll call back. I'll call back.

25:32.098 --> 25:37.118
Ted, you didn't hear anything
through this, did you?

25:37.218 --> 25:38.918
I'm guessing it would
be better if I said no.

25:40.718 --> 25:41.878
Who else would have heard?

25:41.978 --> 25:45.578
Well, that pack was patched
into Nikkii, Jack and, um...

25:56.618 --> 25:57.434
- Lil.
- Hamilton.

25:57.435 --> 25:59.878
- Lil.
- What you just heard through your earpiece...

25:59.978 --> 26:02.718
Lil, it's fine. I know.
I already knew, so...

26:02.778 --> 26:04.218
There's nothing to know.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.078
I have been sensing

26:06.178 --> 26:08.318
a bit of a high-pressure
system between you two.

26:08.458 --> 26:09.316
Please don't.

26:09.328 --> 26:11.938
Just watching the UV index
get to quite dangerous levels.

26:12.098 --> 26:12.945
I kinda get what you're doing.

26:13.018 --> 26:14.578
I'm thinking I might
declare a total fire ban.

26:14.658 --> 26:16.218
Enough with the weather metaphors, yeah?

26:16.318 --> 26:21.318
Look, at the end of the
day, Lil, meteorology,

26:21.378 --> 26:25.078
sexual tension-ology...

26:25.138 --> 26:27.238
... It's all just water and wind.

26:27.338 --> 26:29.678
Water and wind. That's disgusting.

26:29.778 --> 26:32.858
I'm going. Never say
anything to anyone... ever.

26:34.258 --> 26:36.498
- Yeah. No.
- Yeah?

26:39.638 --> 26:41.818
Alice, is Jack still in make-up?

26:41.918 --> 26:45.878
No. He left. Really suddenly.
Weird morning, I guess.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.758
Lil, I'm gonna ask you something,

26:54.858 --> 26:58.038
but I want you to know whatever
the answer, I won't be angry.

26:59.338 --> 27:01.598
Did you say something
to Jack about Lucas?

27:01.658 --> 27:03.498
What? No. Why?

27:03.598 --> 27:05.798
I'm not gonna be angry,
I just wanna know.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.038
I didn't say anything.

27:08.698 --> 27:09.798
There's something in your eyes...

27:09.898 --> 27:11.998
there's a freaked-outedness
in your eyes.

27:12.098 --> 27:16.658
You are the source of the
freaked-outedness. What happened?

27:18.698 --> 27:21.318
I invited him tonight to Pete's
and he said he was gonna come,

27:21.378 --> 27:23.158
he likes meeting people.

27:23.218 --> 27:25.118
Then he just sent me this text.

27:25.218 --> 27:28.218
"Problems at the restaurant.
Can't come tonight."

27:28.258 --> 27:29.998
"Talk tomorrow hopefully."

27:30.098 --> 27:33.878
- 'Hopefully'?
- I'm sorry, Sim, I really don't know.

27:35.338 --> 27:38.158
Yeah. OK.

27:54.058 --> 27:55.758
Hi. You've reached Jack.

27:55.858 --> 27:57.938
I can't get to the phone right now,
but if you leave me your name...

28:11.098 --> 28:13.838
Are these candles a little bit
Marilyn Manson's birthday party?

28:13.938 --> 28:16.678
- I like them. They're from Morocco.
- Oh.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.238
Mm.

28:24.338 --> 28:27.318
- Can you just stand normally?
- I am standing normally.

28:31.378 --> 28:32.478
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.658
- God, look at you.
- Oh.

28:34.738 --> 28:37.398
- Glowing.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.878
Oh, this is Pete.

28:39.978 --> 28:41.658
- Great to meet you, mate.
- Hey, you.

28:41.758 --> 28:43.118
Oh. Yep.

28:43.218 --> 28:46.518
I've been reading your stuff
online. Brilliant taste in music.

28:46.618 --> 28:48.318
- Excellent sign.
- Thank you.

28:48.418 --> 28:51.118
Yeah, I've been looking
at you, too, on YouTube.

28:51.178 --> 28:52.798
On YouTube? I'm not on YouTube.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.658
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, you are.
- Really?

28:54.758 --> 28:56.498
What am I doing? Should I be worried?

28:56.558 --> 28:57.438
Oh, nothing too bad.

28:57.538 --> 29:01.198
You're just talking about,
um... Investment Bankery stuff.

29:01.298 --> 29:04.198
I couldn't understand it, really.

29:04.258 --> 29:06.118
Oh. What can I get you to drink?

29:06.218 --> 29:09.518
- Well, why don't you open that one?
- Mm. Wow.

29:09.578 --> 29:10.958
Pickering Valley.

29:11.018 --> 29:12.758
I love your place.

29:12.858 --> 29:15.658
- Thanks.
- Wow.

29:15.758 --> 29:16.718
- So...
- So, do you...

29:16.778 --> 29:18.518
Sorry, you go.

29:18.578 --> 29:19.958
So, how did you two meet?

29:20.018 --> 29:22.018
When I started working at the cafÃ©.

29:22.118 --> 29:24.158
Oh, you used to wait tables, did you,

29:24.218 --> 29:25.478
when you were cracking into writing?

29:25.578 --> 29:30.118
I still do. Yeah, just
to... to... supplement it.

29:30.218 --> 29:33.318
Mm. Yeah. And you guys?

29:33.418 --> 29:34.838
- University.
- Yeah.

29:34.938 --> 29:37.478
Do you realise it's
20 years since we met?

29:37.578 --> 29:39.038
- It is not.
- It's true.

29:39.138 --> 29:41.598
- Oh.
- It's disturbing, but it's true.

29:41.658 --> 29:43.518
We actually met in the grunge era.

29:43.618 --> 29:45.078
- Sound garden, stuff like that.
- Yeah.

29:45.178 --> 29:47.658
And, believe it or not,
we totally lived it.

29:47.758 --> 29:49.598
- We did.
- Totally.

29:49.658 --> 29:50.838
Oh, my gosh, so much flannel.

29:50.938 --> 29:54.378
A lot of flannel. Acres
of flannel. Right, right.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.438
And now look at you... in the
hipster era with a hipster.

29:57.778 --> 29:59.658
No, no, I'm not really a hipster.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.958
Oh, come on, you're a
music journalist, a barista.

30:02.058 --> 30:04.078
There's a lot of hipster
in that combination.

30:04.178 --> 30:06.358
Well, maybe if I had a
weird beard or something.

30:06.458 --> 30:08.558
- Yeah.
- You do have a beard.

30:08.658 --> 30:11.318
Yeah, but not the...

30:11.378 --> 30:13.358
That will be the others.

30:14.658 --> 30:15.758
Hey.

30:17.498 --> 30:20.318
Hi. Oh, it's lovely to meet you at last.

30:20.418 --> 30:23.078
- You, too.
- Meredith, this is Lily.

30:23.178 --> 30:25.298
- You must be Simone.
- I'm Simone.

30:25.398 --> 30:27.718
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

30:27.778 --> 30:29.018
Yeah.

30:29.098 --> 30:32.038
- Your place is gorgeous.
- Oh.

30:32.098 --> 30:33.298
So not Pete-esque.

30:33.398 --> 30:36.158
Oh, really? What
qualifies as Pete-esque?

30:36.258 --> 30:38.658
Oh, it's classy,
imaginative, sophisticated.

30:38.738 --> 30:40.558
- Filth. Total filth.
- Yeah.

30:40.658 --> 30:43.718
Do you know, one time I
went round to Pete's house

30:43.778 --> 30:45.658
and it really, really stank.

30:45.758 --> 30:48.358
And I asked him, "when was the
last time you washed your towels?"

30:48.458 --> 30:50.318
- OK.
- And do you know what he said?

30:50.418 --> 30:53.518
"Why would I wash my towels? I
only use them when I'm clean."

30:54.618 --> 30:56.878
I was being ecologically responsible.

30:56.978 --> 30:58.518
Hi, I'm Mitchell. Lovely to meet you.

30:58.618 --> 31:01.358
- Oh, you're Meredith's friend.
- Yeah. Very old friend, yes.

31:01.418 --> 31:02.518
Oh, not that old.

31:02.618 --> 31:05.158
Lily and I were at
university together, too.

31:05.258 --> 31:07.678
- Yeah, we were.
- Were you? At uni? Girlfriend?

31:07.778 --> 31:10.318
Oh, no, no. No, nothing
romantic between us. No.

31:10.418 --> 31:13.518
- I can assure you.
- Almost.

31:13.578 --> 31:15.518
Oh, really?

31:15.578 --> 31:17.198
What? It was one hook-up.

31:17.298 --> 31:20.478
- OK, just...
- Well, briefly.

31:20.578 --> 31:24.078
It was a disaster, by the way.
Don't worry, it was a total disaster.

31:24.138 --> 31:27.298
Not helping, Sim. Not helping.

31:27.398 --> 31:32.878
I would be reassured, because you
went there and it sucked, so...

31:32.978 --> 31:35.238
What? It didn't... Yeah.

31:35.338 --> 31:38.578
I didn't need reassuring, but thank you.

31:45.011 --> 31:47.626
I don't know maybe he's
just flirtatious kind of guy.

31:47.630 --> 31:49.275
- So you admit he's flirting?
- I'm not saying that.

31:49.398 --> 31:50.758
I mean, how about the bit where
he asked if you were my girlfriend?

31:50.858 --> 31:54.518
- That was cock block of the century.
- Pete, she's pregnant to you.

31:54.598 --> 31:57.098
I don't think it's possible for him
to block your cock at this stage.

31:57.198 --> 31:58.978
Well, not past cock, but
future cock's very blockable.

31:59.038 --> 32:00.898
Future cock is on the block.

32:00.998 --> 32:02.378
- Is everything OK?
- Yes, great.

32:02.478 --> 32:04.658
Good. No, I was just showing...
So, yeah, this is little bofa.

32:04.758 --> 32:06.630
So, they have morning
TV on the weekends?

32:06.648 --> 32:08.808
Oh, yeah, they have it
every day of the week.

32:08.908 --> 32:11.048
It's hosted by a guy... I
don't know if you know him.

32:11.148 --> 32:14.548
His name's Eric Albrectson,
and a woman called Erica Jones.

32:14.588 --> 32:16.008
No. No, I'll have to look him up.

32:16.108 --> 32:18.208
Oh, no, don't. You
probably won't like him.

32:18.308 --> 32:20.928
Oh. Excuse me.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.208
Oh, that was delicious.

32:23.308 --> 32:26.848
- Mum? Yeah, I'm at dinner. I can't...
- Could you come around?

32:26.948 --> 32:30.908
- What's wrong?
- I can't move my face. It's frozen.

32:30.948 --> 32:32.728
Mum, you didn't!

32:32.828 --> 32:36.208
I think I'm having some
kind of an allergic reaction.

32:36.308 --> 32:39.768
- Well, have you showed Vincent?
- I... I can't tell Vincent.

32:39.868 --> 32:42.608
- He's a trained doctor.
- No, he'll just tell your father.

32:44.028 --> 32:45.808
Well, Mum, I can't leave.

32:45.868 --> 32:48.408
I mean, I'm sure it will be OK, but,

32:48.508 --> 32:50.288
look, I'll come round
first thing in the morning.

32:50.388 --> 32:52.608
If it gets worse please go see Vincent.

32:52.668 --> 32:54.048
Alright. OK.

32:54.108 --> 32:56.328
Sorry. Have a good dinner.

32:56.428 --> 32:59.128
- Don't tell your father.
- Goodbye, Mum.

33:01.528 --> 33:02.768
- Sorry about that.
- Everything alright?

33:02.868 --> 33:08.728
Yeah, yeah, fine. I'd describe
it as a medical non-emergency.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.448
Well, um, while we're all here...

33:12.548 --> 33:14.548
Oh.

33:14.648 --> 33:18.328
... Look, I just wanna take
this opportunity to thank you

33:18.388 --> 33:20.548
for this lovely dinner

33:20.648 --> 33:24.808
and to say, well, it's just
been so great to meet you, Pete.

33:24.868 --> 33:26.448
You too.

33:26.508 --> 33:28.088
And you too, Lily and Simone.

33:30.028 --> 33:31.968
Meredith has always been...

33:33.588 --> 33:36.248
... Well, she's a really
important part of my life,

33:36.348 --> 33:40.448
and I am just so happy
that she's getting something

33:40.548 --> 33:43.728
she's always wanted
and has always deserved.

33:46.228 --> 33:48.488
So, cheers to you both.

33:48.548 --> 33:49.908
Cheers.

33:51.388 --> 33:53.688
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:55.588 --> 33:56.828
Oh, and I got this.

33:58.268 --> 34:02.688
Just... just a little gift
for later. Don't open it now.

34:02.788 --> 34:05.008
- Why? What is this?
- It's just a little gift. Later.

34:15.228 --> 34:17.408
Oh.

34:17.467 --> 34:19.328
It's for $30,000.

34:19.428 --> 34:20.928
I was gonna wait till the baby was born,

34:21.027 --> 34:23.128
but I thought maybe you could
use it now to get set up.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.188
- Oh, I don't know what to say.
- We can't take that.

34:27.947 --> 34:31.007
That's too much, sorry.
I mean, thank you.

34:31.108 --> 34:34.088
Thank you, it's incredibly generous
of you, but we don't need that.

34:34.188 --> 34:35.648
- It's really no problem.
- No, I know.

34:35.748 --> 34:37.928
- You could put it in a trust or...
- Yeah, we're fine.

34:37.987 --> 34:39.188
Thanks.

34:46.428 --> 34:47.928
- Are you done? Mmm!
- Yeah.

34:48.027 --> 34:49.848
- We'll clear the plates up.
- I'll help.

34:49.947 --> 34:52.328
Can I take that? I'll take that for you.

34:56.987 --> 35:00.548
- Ooh. Wow. Spicy, wasn't it?
- Good.

35:00.648 --> 35:02.768
But you didn't have to
reject it straight away.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.968
What was I supposed to say? "Thank
you, we'll discuss it later"?

35:05.028 --> 35:06.568
Yeah, maybe.

35:06.668 --> 35:11.608
I mean, honestly, Pete, that amount
of money, it's nothing to Mitchell.

35:11.668 --> 35:12.434
That's not the point.

35:12.435 --> 35:14.755
I don't want to be 30 grand
in debt to your ex-boyfriend.

35:15.348 --> 35:17.848
I think we need to check in
with what's driving you here,

35:17.948 --> 35:20.548
because I think you're letting
your pride drive you right now.

35:20.588 --> 35:21.768
Yeah, probably.

35:21.868 --> 35:24.048
I mean, I would like to
retain some level of pride.

35:25.548 --> 35:27.688
OK, can we visualise something?

35:27.788 --> 35:32.048
- Meredith.
- Please, just... Just for a moment.

35:32.108 --> 35:33.048
Please?

35:34.748 --> 35:37.208
- Yeah?
- OK.

35:37.308 --> 35:40.728
Good. OK, so, now, I want
you to take that pride...

35:43.108 --> 35:45.768
... And just set it
aside just for a second.

35:47.088 --> 35:49.568
- Are you doing that?
- OK, yeah.

35:49.668 --> 35:53.448
And now I want you to picture our baby.

35:53.548 --> 35:56.728
- Are you picturing our child?
- Yeah.

35:58.868 --> 36:05.518
And it's just turned 10 and it's
looking up to me and it says,

36:05.868 --> 36:09.328
"Dad, why the hell did you let
Mum's ex pay for my education?"

36:09.388 --> 36:10.828
"Do you have a ball sac or not?"

36:13.408 --> 36:14.688
Well, that was the vision.

36:23.384 --> 36:25.804
Hi, you've reached Jack. I can't
get to the phone right now...

36:25.864 --> 36:27.364
Message bank again.

36:29.464 --> 36:32.524
I feel like he liked me at first

36:32.624 --> 36:36.644
and then he got to know
me and then he stopped.

36:36.744 --> 36:39.004
- Always happens.
- No, it doesn't.

36:39.104 --> 36:41.084
I've known you forever and I like you.

36:42.264 --> 36:43.924
Yeah, but you don't
wanna have sex with me.

36:44.024 --> 36:46.244
- That's true.
- Actually one time you did.

36:46.304 --> 36:47.524
No, I didn't.

36:47.624 --> 36:49.704
You did get completely
naked in front of me.

36:49.804 --> 36:52.064
I have never willingly
got naked in front of you,

36:52.144 --> 36:55.004
you have stormed in while
I was getting changed.

36:55.064 --> 36:56.604
You laughed.

36:56.704 --> 37:00.124
Yeah, like a "you're
unbelievable, Simone" laugh.

37:01.584 --> 37:05.344
But there were layers to
the laugh. Sexual layers.

37:05.444 --> 37:09.364
- I can hear them, yeah.
- What?

37:09.464 --> 37:11.924
There was a slight sex layer then, too.

37:16.784 --> 37:19.844
It just felt so heavy
in the brow, like cement,

37:19.944 --> 37:24.344
and then Vincent tells
me it looks toxic.

37:24.384 --> 37:26.564
No, I said it's toxic because it is.

37:26.664 --> 37:29.244
It's a neurotoxic protein. I
was just being accurate, Mum.

37:29.344 --> 37:32.704
I feel reaction-wise like I'm
in a lose-lose situation here.

37:32.744 --> 37:35.444
Either I concur and I make you panic

37:35.544 --> 37:39.804
or I deny and I make you
think you've wasted $300.

37:39.864 --> 37:42.364
Oh, I don't care about the $300.

37:42.464 --> 37:47.784
Mum, you look as good as ever and
you have nothing to worry about.

37:47.824 --> 37:49.204
Isn't that right, Vincent?

37:49.304 --> 37:51.644
Are we seriously becoming the family
that has to convince our mother

37:51.704 --> 37:53.204
that her Botox is OK?

37:55.024 --> 37:57.444
You look great, Mum.
You don't need Botox.

37:59.204 --> 38:01.064
I have got to move out.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.164
- Hey, Mum?
- Mmm?

38:06.264 --> 38:12.564
If you were overheard talking
about someone at work, a colleague,

38:12.664 --> 38:16.644
and you were going on about how
attractive they are jokingly...

38:18.384 --> 38:20.444
... But there is a chance
that they overheard,

38:20.544 --> 38:25.064
would you apologise or just
pretend it never happened?

38:25.144 --> 38:26.964
- Did they hear you?
- Possibly.

38:28.564 --> 38:29.764
Highly likely, yeah.

38:30.744 --> 38:32.644
- And do you like them?
- What?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.764
- Do you like them?
- No!

38:34.864 --> 38:38.204
No, and is... is that even relevant?

38:38.304 --> 38:40.244
I think it's at the centre
of the whole problem.

38:41.284 --> 38:42.364
Oh, my God!

38:43.644 --> 38:46.064
Oh! I can frown! Ha-ha!

38:59.931 --> 39:01.849
Come in.

39:02.909 --> 39:05.209
Hey. Hi. Um...

39:05.309 --> 39:09.489
- Are you not answering my calls?
- Sorry. Insane day yesterday.

39:09.549 --> 39:10.969
My sous-chef went over on his bike.

39:11.069 --> 39:13.529
- Had to pull a 14-hour shift.
- Oh.

39:13.629 --> 39:16.569
- What did you need me for?
- I...

39:16.629 --> 39:18.009
I...

39:18.069 --> 39:19.609
I just thought maybe I should, um...

39:20.829 --> 39:24.289
... clarify, er, something
that I said yesterday.

39:24.349 --> 39:25.369
Um...

39:25.469 --> 39:28.069
Something that you might have overheard.

39:28.109 --> 39:29.209
What was that?

39:29.269 --> 39:30.769
You didn't...

39:30.829 --> 39:32.709
... hear anything... odd?

39:34.109 --> 39:35.429
Did you say something odd?

39:35.469 --> 39:37.649
Nope. No.

39:37.749 --> 39:40.569
So you wanted to come down and
tell me you didn't say anything odd?

39:43.929 --> 39:45.349
Yep.

39:45.389 --> 39:48.889
Look, I did hear something

39:48.989 --> 39:51.849
that maybe I don't think
you realised I could hear.

39:51.949 --> 39:53.889
- In your earpiece?
- About me being 70%...

39:53.989 --> 39:56.169
I might come in for a
brief chat just quickly.

39:58.309 --> 40:00.849
- Really, you don't have to explain.
- No, I really, really do.

40:00.949 --> 40:03.129
- Lily, it's fine.
- Oh, it's just...

40:03.189 --> 40:04.449
The whole Eric thing happened

40:04.549 --> 40:08.129
and then I was on the phone to my
friend who I always joke around with

40:08.229 --> 40:13.729
and I said that 70% thing and
all the other things I said.

40:13.789 --> 40:15.369
It was really a way of saying...

40:17.629 --> 40:18.969
... I loved what you did.

40:20.789 --> 40:22.589
It was a really confusing
way of me saying it

40:22.689 --> 40:26.369
and a stupid, stupid thing
for me to say and I just...

40:26.469 --> 40:28.809
Honestly I thought it was funny.
I didn't give it a second thought.

40:28.869 --> 40:30.769
It's just Simone's my best friend...

40:30.869 --> 40:31.769
- Look.
- ... And I...

40:31.829 --> 40:33.229
Simone and I...

40:33.329 --> 40:36.369
Whatever happens between us is
completely separate to you and I.

40:37.349 --> 40:38.369
OK?

40:40.889 --> 40:41.949
OK.

40:42.029 --> 40:43.769
As far as I'm concerned, it's all good.

40:45.009 --> 40:46.229
OK?

40:47.429 --> 40:49.049
OK.

40:49.149 --> 40:52.009
I mean, apart from anything
else, 70%, it's not that high.

40:52.109 --> 40:54.409
No, it's actually... it's quite
moderate, really, isn't it?

40:54.509 --> 40:56.769
Well, my main worry was,
"where am I losing the 30%?"

40:56.829 --> 40:57.889
I've got to work on that.

40:57.949 --> 41:00.129
You do talk a lot about meditation.

41:00.229 --> 41:01.949
- What's wrong with meditation?
- Freaks me out.

41:02.029 --> 41:03.849
And I get especially
freaked out by people

41:03.949 --> 41:06.449
who post pictures of
themselves meditating,

41:06.509 --> 41:08.689
which you've been known to do.

41:08.789 --> 41:10.369
I mean, who actually
takes that photograph?

41:10.429 --> 41:12.729
Well, I did afterwards.

41:12.789 --> 41:14.089
So you admit you weren't meditating?

41:14.149 --> 41:15.449
I had been seconds earlier.

41:15.509 --> 41:17.769
#Meditation fraud.

41:17.869 --> 41:20.609
And thousands of people like
those pictures, including your mum.

41:20.709 --> 41:23.529
I should also point out
that you only went up to 70%

41:23.589 --> 41:25.409
because of the whole Eric situation,

41:25.469 --> 41:26.409
and since that's over

41:26.509 --> 41:28.229
you've dropped right back
down to your normal level,

41:28.329 --> 41:29.489
- which is much lower.
- How much lower?

41:29.589 --> 41:31.009
- Sub-50.
- Sub-50?

41:31.109 --> 41:33.049
Yeah.

41:37.269 --> 41:38.369
I should go.

41:39.909 --> 41:41.729
- Oh!
- Simone.

41:41.829 --> 41:44.309
Oh, no, take it. Take it,
take it, just don't mention me.

41:44.389 --> 41:46.589
- Don't mention anything about me.
- We're not doing anything wrong.

41:46.689 --> 41:47.689
I know. We're at work.

41:47.789 --> 41:50.609
- I know. Take it.
- Simone?

41:50.669 --> 41:51.729
Hey.

41:51.829 --> 41:54.329
Ah, yeah, sorry, I just... I
got up and came straight to work.

41:56.429 --> 41:58.649
Ah, tonight's going to be difficult.

41:58.709 --> 42:00.129
I don't always say that.
