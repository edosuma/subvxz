00:08.467 --> 00:11.637
- How do you like that mouth?
- It's not very mouth-like.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.931
- I think it works.
- It's tilted to the side.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.642
It was intentional.
It gives her a unique expression.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.268
- Like she had a stroke?
- Fine.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.771
I'll use the Mrs. Potato Head lips.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.898
No, forget it. Leave Stroke-mouth.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.943
- It's not like we're going to win this.
- Bad attitude.

00:26.026 --> 00:30.572
Mom, face it. That is the single most
incredible snowman I have ever seen.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.367
I'm sorry, that snowman
is way over the top. Too showy.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.119
It's screaming,
'I'm incredible. I'm special. Look at me. '

00:36.203 --> 00:38.914
Kind of the point
of a snowman-building contest.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.043
I hate this man
with every fiber of my being.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.503
- He looks nice.
- He's a ringer.

00:44.586 --> 00:45.629
How do you figure?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.631
Someone promised him
a handsome sum...

00:47.714 --> 00:50.300
financed his theatrical
snowman accoutrements...

00:50.384 --> 00:52.719
so he could snatch victory
from a deserving local...

00:52.803 --> 00:54.721
in order to bag the contest prize.

00:54.805 --> 00:58.934
Seems a little elaborate considering
the prize is a set of new US quarters.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.686
We're ignoring him now.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.521
What are we doing on your school break?

01:02.563 --> 01:03.981
- A lot of nothing.
- Sounds good.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.316
- Plus some homework.
- And a lot of movies.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.694
We have to rent Godfather llI on DVD.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.696
- You're kidding.
- In the audio commentary...

01:10.779 --> 01:13.782
- Coppola defends casting Sofia.
- That is fatherly love.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.325
What's this homework you have?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.536
- Just stuff for the paper.
- What? Why?

01:17.619 --> 01:20.497
Paris wants the first issue back
to be a double issue.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.709
So we have to prep over break.
She says the news never sleeps.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.252
Does Paris ever sleep?

01:25.335 --> 01:28.338
I think she periodically makes
a whirring noise and shuts down.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.717
- You can't work the whole time.
- I won't. I promise.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.844
- My God.
- What?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.637
He's power buffing.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.516
Now, that is just wrong.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.394
We're competing against
the Michelangelo of snow.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.397
- We're 'Ernest Builds a Snowman. '
- We shouldn't look at him.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.732
Heads down. Stay focused.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.901
- We can do this.
- Absolutely.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.364
- Let's get some coffee?
- Right behind you.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

02:55.592 --> 02:58.846
Yes, you can rent a car in Manhattan
and return it in Hartford.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.848
That's no problem, sir.

03:03.475 --> 03:06.562
Yes, you can return it
to Bradley International.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.440
That's very convenient, or you...

03:10.899 --> 03:13.694
You can... Hold, please.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.241
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

03:19.324 --> 03:21.577
Stop jumping like a Mexican bean.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.620
Lorelai asked me
to dust the picture frames.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.206
How do you suggest
I clean the tops, smarty?

03:27.708 --> 03:31.670
- I didn't know you could do that.
- Yes, I am miraculously talented.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.756
I thought an alarm would go off,
like in The Thomas Crown Affair.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.802
That would be if this was a museum
and you were a man allowed in museums.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.847
No bickering in the lobby, guys.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.351
Where are we allowed to bicker?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.353
Got all the mushrooms?
You double-checked?

03:48.437 --> 03:50.772
I've triple-checked. I've quadruple-checked.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.066
The shiitake, the nameko, the chanterelle?

03:53.150 --> 03:56.570
- Once again, I've got it all.
- The matsutake? The makinia?

03:56.653 --> 03:59.323
- Wait. I don't have makinia.
- You don't have makinia?

03:59.406 --> 04:01.325
- Don't have makinia.
- I made it up.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.702
- You passed the test.
- Don't test me.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
The auditions are starting.
You wanna watch?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.206
- Yes.
- Auditions for what?

04:07.289 --> 04:09.124
- Musicians.
- For the Bracebridge dinner.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.168
You guys are going crazy with this dinner.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.587
I told you,
this dinner is not just about food.

04:13.670 --> 04:17.007
We are recreating
an authentic 19th-century meal.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.677
The servers will be in period clothing,
and they'll speak period English.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.763
- Here, look at the costumes.
- Nice.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.640
We're talking seven courses here.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.851
Soup, fish, peacock pie,
the Baron of Beef, the salad...

04:27.935 --> 04:29.937
then the plum pudding, and the wassail.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.314
There's gonna be a big raised platform...

04:32.397 --> 04:36.193
where the Squire of Bracebridge
is going to preside over the festivities.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.654
He tastes the foods
and makes pronouncements.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.990
He's the host of the evening,
and his costume is the coolest.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.910
- It all sounds great.
- It is.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.120
By the way,
you're playing Squire Bracebridge.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.580
- Ready?
- Let's go.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.123
What was that?

04:50.332 --> 04:51.542
What are we looking at today?

04:51.625 --> 04:55.420
This is the last on our list. We've got
our trumpets, our madrigal singers.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.923
Sorry, but I'm not playing
Squire Bracebridge.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.260
We've got our servers.
This is for recorder players and harpists.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.303
Hi. Lay some on us, guys.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.396
You cats really know
how to blow those things.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.440
You've got the gig.
I'll call later with the details. Thanks.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.485
Are we clear on this?
I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.529
Sorry you thought that I'd do this.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.490
- When do the guests arrive?
- Thursday at 4:00 on their own jet.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.034
- After buying out the whole inn.
- Nice to have money.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.452
Know what struck me today?

05:27.536 --> 05:30.789
- The fact that I'm not the squire?
- We are crazy for doing this.

05:30.873 --> 05:31.874
We are beyond crazy.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.792
We're'Anne Heche speaking to God...

05:33.834 --> 05:36.211
'and looking for the spaceship
in Fresno' crazy.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.214
- Oquinis no-goodo noto.
- II ecnatra dos guidan.

05:39.298 --> 05:42.801
Springing this on me at the last minute,
that's just manipulative.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.136
Sookie, fire.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.306
I got to get back. You'll handle the harp?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.141
- You got it.
- All right, I'll do it.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.810
I'll play Squire Bracebridge
if that's what you want.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.061
Thanks, sweetie.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.398
As long as it's not just because
I fit the costume.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.610
It's because I fit the costume, isn't it?

05:59.693 --> 06:00.944
Go ahead.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.494
- Hi, it's Lorelai.
- Hey, it's me.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.622
Hi, Chris, how are you?

06:11.914 --> 06:13.540
Good. You got a minute?

06:14.541 --> 06:17.169
It's not 'uh, oh. '
I just wanted to run an idea by you.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.212
Run it.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.048
I don't want to step on any plans
you've already made...

06:21.131 --> 06:23.133
but Rory has a school break coming up...

06:23.217 --> 06:26.887
and I was wondering if you'd be cool
with her visiting for a couple of days.

06:27.679 --> 06:30.265
A couple of days?
You mean she'd stay the night?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.851
Yeah, it's totally your call.
Where are you, heaven?

06:32.935 --> 06:35.395
Do you even have room
for someone to stay?

06:35.479 --> 06:38.273
Not just room. A room.
A designated guest room.

06:38.357 --> 06:41.193
- Sherry fixed it up really nice.
- Good for her.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.862
- What do you think?
- It's awfully last-minute.

06:43.946 --> 06:47.324
It's totally last-minute. You can say no.
There'll be no hard feelings.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.785
It's really up to Rory to say yes or no.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.913
- You're cool with it?
- Yeah, sure, if Rory is.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.415
That's great. Thank you.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.710
I'll let you run it past her,
and get back to me whenever.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.254
- No pressure.
- No pressure.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.964
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.715
Talk to you later.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.275
So what are your travel plans, Dad?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.194
You and Mom always go out of town
this time of year.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.322
- Last year it was the Bahamas.
- That's right, it was.

07:27.406 --> 07:31.577
I remember you had fun, too.
You said the Bahamamians were real nice.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.621
- The Bahamites? The Bahamamamanians?
- The Bahamians.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.665
- Yes, they were nice.
- They were nice.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.959
So what are your plans?

07:39.042 --> 07:42.045
- We're not going anywhere this year.
- Why not?

07:44.840 --> 07:48.093
Well, it can be really nice
just to stay at home...

07:48.177 --> 07:51.889
because you can do fun things
that you normally wouldn't have time for.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.767
Yeah, like play Running Charades
and get out that Slip 'N Slide.

07:55.851 --> 07:58.604
- We'll see.
- Yes, we'll see.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.773
Would you all excuse me?
I have to make some calls.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.902
- Say goodbye before you leave, will you?
- Sure, Dad.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.449
When is this awfulness with work
gonna resolve itself?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.868
I don't know. The man is so sensitive.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.871
He reads so much
into every little perceived slight.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.791
I remember when I was a kid,
Dad had put on some weight...

08:19.875 --> 08:22.294
and he bought a new suit
to try to cover it up.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.671
He wore it for us and said,
'How do I look?'

08:24.755 --> 08:26.632
I said, 'You look fat. '

08:29.218 --> 08:32.429
I guess that wasn't really
a perceived slight.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.390
I'll think of another example.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.979
Keep in mind, at the Bracebridge dinner,
we are not just servers.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.356
We are performers.

08:42.438 --> 08:47.110
Any time you're with a guest, you must be
in character and must speak Old English.

08:47.152 --> 08:50.197
It's a world we're creating here,
so whatever we can do...

08:50.280 --> 08:52.574
Kirk, you're driving me crazy.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.951
Who, me?

08:54.326 --> 08:57.663
'Whatever we can do to...
Kirk, you're driving me crazy. '

08:57.788 --> 08:59.122
Me. Sorry.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.542
Guys, look at the materials I gave you.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.628
Tell me, if a guest asks you
how the food's coming...

09:04.711 --> 09:07.589
what would be the appropriate
Old English response?

09:09.675 --> 09:10.759
'Greetings. '

09:10.843 --> 09:13.554
- You just read the first thing on the list.
- Maybe.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.722
Guys, the correct response:

09:15.806 --> 09:18.934
'Our ovens, they with baked meat choke. '

09:19.017 --> 09:20.477
- Question.
- Yes?

09:20.561 --> 09:22.980
What color dress will I be wearing
when I say this?

09:23.021 --> 09:25.607
- Don't be an idiot.
- This is stupid.

09:25.691 --> 09:29.444
Shut up and pay attention to Sookie.
She worked very hard to bring this about.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.281
But unfortunately,
we don't all share intimacies with her...

09:32.364 --> 09:34.157
so she doesn't cut us any slack.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.159
She doesn't treat me differently.

09:36.201 --> 09:39.788
She's called you 'Peaches' three times.
It's all in the transcript.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.208
Instead of talking Old English,
can I talk like an old man?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.544
- What?
- You kids, get off my lawn!

09:45.586 --> 09:48.505
No, you cannot just talk like an old man.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.883
Honey, what's the matter?

09:50.924 --> 09:53.051
- They're snowed in.
- Who's snowed in?

09:53.135 --> 09:56.555
The Bracebridge group.
They're stuck in Chicago. The dinner's off.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.973
- No.
- Yes.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.224
I'm gonna cry.

09:59.308 --> 10:02.352
I offered to fund the invention
of a molecular transport device...

10:02.436 --> 10:03.562
but they didn't go for it.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.940
That makes me so mad. And so sad.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.942
- I'm smad.
- Sookie?

10:09.443 --> 10:13.655
Does this mean that my pockets
willeth not with money get choked?

10:14.198 --> 10:16.825
That sounded like Old English. Cool.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.912
I've got 30 pounds of aged beef...

10:19.995 --> 10:23.248
trays and trays of trout,
mountains of prune tarts.

10:23.290 --> 10:27.419
I diced pumpkins until my hands
turned orange. I've got pumpkin hands.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.922
- Take a sip.
- How can you stay so calm about this?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.966
- There's nothing we can do.
- I can't believe they got snowed in.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.928
All that work. All that extra help we hired.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.348
At least they paid for it already.
We didn't lose any money.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.768
I guess. I could still make up
the dinner for the three of us.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.396
Then it would be the three of us
all alone in the dining room.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.150
Like The Shining, except
instead of Jack Nicholson, we have Rune.

10:50.234 --> 10:52.236
You girls want anything besides coffee?

10:52.277 --> 10:54.279
- What about Luke?
- What about him?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.365
He eats, and Jess eats.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.116
- Doesn't Jess eat?
- What's she doing?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.452
I think she's inviting you for dinner.

11:00.536 --> 11:04.206
Yeah, come on, join us. It'll be fun.
You like peacock pie?

11:04.289 --> 11:07.042
- I'm 100% sure I don't.
- There'll be normal food, too.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.502
- And decorations.
- And music.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.420
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- Well...

11:10.504 --> 11:13.298
You know what? Let's invite everyone.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.425
- Everyone who?
- Everyone everyone.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.595
- Everyone everyone who?
- Everyone we know. Everyone we like.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.430
They can even stay in the Inn.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.808
All those empty rooms,
those uneaten pillow mints.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.185
An out-of-control,
over-the-top slumber party.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.479
- I love it!
- Done. Spread the word.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.981
I haven't said I'd come yet...

11:29.022 --> 11:32.234
so I'm certainly not gonna
suddenly become your messenger boy.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.485
- 8:00?
- 7:00.

11:33.569 --> 11:34.570
Right.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.451
Are you going to this big shindig
at the Inn tonight?

11:41.493 --> 11:44.037
I'm just trying to trick my mom
into not going with me.

11:44.121 --> 11:47.166
- How's that coming along?
- How's that Pixies reunion coming along?

11:47.249 --> 11:49.877
- I'll see you and your mom there.
- Bye.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.671
Keep it up and you'll get hurt.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.383
Hey, guys! Come on. Break it up.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.926
Quit! Hold it! Get off me!

11:59.052 --> 12:01.054
Get off me, man! I'm not fighting you.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.514
Jess, knock it off.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.684
What the hell is your problem?
You saw it was me.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.061
- Why'd you keep punching?
- I had momentum.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.396
I was trying to help you.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.191
I don't need your help,
but thanks for offering.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.944
- Did Bootsy R.S.V. P?
- Yeah, he's coming.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.531
- Thanks. Is he bringing anybody?
- He's coming solo.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.285
- I'm gonna put him in Room 16 with Luke.
- You can't do that.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.537
- Let me have my fun.
- Luke's coming with Jess.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.498
I'll put Jess in with Miss Patty.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.292
- There'll be no Jess left in the morning.
- You stink.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.212
- Are these last year's cards or this year's?
- This year's.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.839
Don't scoff.
Last year's set was here till Halloween.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.468
If that's a crack at my housekeeping skills,
then okay.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.386
- Wow.
- What?

12:41.470 --> 12:44.139
This is one ugly-looking baby.
Whose baby is this?

12:44.223 --> 12:48.060
- That's your second cousin Stan's poor kid.
- He got Stan's everything.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.396
- That's not the ugliest baby in the bunch.
- You're kidding.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.732
That's the ugliest baby in the bunch.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.776
Why do people put pictures on cards?

12:55.859 --> 12:58.612
Do they not understand
we are unapologetic mockers?

12:58.695 --> 13:01.698
There's an unexplained innocence
in the world.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.700
- I didn't see this.
- See what?

13:03.784 --> 13:04.826
Dad.

13:06.078 --> 13:09.456
- The woman, I'm assuming, is Sherry.
- Did I not show you that?

13:09.790 --> 13:12.084
They've got a cute little puppy
and everything.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.587
I must've put it in the stack
and forgotten to tell you about it.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.090
- There it is.
- Nice-looking lady.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.008
Like a young Tammy Faye Bakker.

13:20.092 --> 13:23.011
- But prettier than that.
- I didn't mean not pretty.

13:23.095 --> 13:26.807
Question about the room list.
Room 31, why is it empty?

13:26.890 --> 13:29.101
- I wanted to run an idea by you.
- Run it.

13:29.184 --> 13:32.479
I thought maybe a certain depressed man
and his wife could stay there.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.940
- Woody and Soon-Yi?
- Grandma and Grandpa.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.693
- You've got to be kidding.
- This could cheer him up.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.445
I'll send him a Def Jam comedy tape.
That'll cheer him up.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.156
- It's a good thing to do.
- We'll donate money to charity.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.868
That's a good thing, too.
We'll stop kicking dogs.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.412
I'll pencil them in,
but they'll probably say no.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.039
But we're not gonna hope
that they say no, right?

13:51.123 --> 13:53.458
- Right.
- Because that would be really bad karma...

13:53.500 --> 13:55.836
especially on top of making fun
of the ugly babies.

13:55.919 --> 14:00.424
I have a New Year's resolution for you.
Become more cynical and self-absorbed.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.967
I'll work on it.

14:06.305 --> 14:09.183
- How's Sookie doing in there?
- She's paper-bagging it.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.726
- What?
- You know...

14:11.643 --> 14:13.353
So she's right on schedule.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.731
- Hey, dolls.
- Welcome.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.816
- Are we the first ones here?
- Yes, you are.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.820
Now, don't you freak out.
Morey hates being the first anywhere.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.323
He thinks it hurts his street credibility.

14:24.406 --> 14:28.994
- Charlie Parker was late to everything.
- He had more drugs in him than a Rite Aid.

14:29.077 --> 14:32.372
- Forget Charlie Parker.
- You two are in Room 8. It's ready for you.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.416
Thanks, doll. Come on, Morey.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.336
We could be late for dinner
if it'll make you feel better.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.670
A little.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.882
- Are you alone?
- Lane.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.718
My wedding night's
gonna be very interesting.

14:45.177 --> 14:48.347
I'm glad you guys could come.
You guys are in Room 12.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.475
Thank you. Hello, Lorelai.
Thank you for inviting us.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.269
Our pleasure.
Do you need help bringing in your stuff?

14:54.353 --> 14:56.772
This is my stuff.
Don't need any more stuff.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.399
- People have too much stuff.
- You know, you're right.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.860
People have too much stuff. Absolutely.

15:03.237 --> 15:07.115
- Says the woman with 64 pairs of shoes.
- Thus proving my point.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.076
What is Paris doing here?

15:09.159 --> 15:12.871
She had to bring me the newspaper
stuff tonight. She couldn't wait.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.165
Robot, she's a robot. Hi.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.459
Here are the materials
on the double issue.

15:17.543 --> 15:20.045
Some of the articles
will need complete re-writes.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.965
Madeline's 500 words on test anxiety
spends 400 of them...

15:23.048 --> 15:26.385
arguing that stretch corduroy
is the best material for low-rise jeans.

15:26.468 --> 15:29.304
Well, let's see. Corduroy is a fabric.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.976
The fabric of society is weakened
when students...

15:34.059 --> 15:36.895
- You can't get there.
- It doesn't look like it.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.356
- I'll get on this tomorrow.
- What about tonight?

15:39.398 --> 15:41.400
- I'm busy tonight.
- Doing what?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.026
Well, this.

15:44.570 --> 15:47.322
- What is this?
- It's kind of a big dinner party.

15:48.073 --> 15:52.035
I'll get out of your way.
Call if you need to talk things through.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.705
She uses the Prince version of writing.

15:54.746 --> 15:58.584
A letter 'U' for 'you'
and a picture of an eye for an 'I.'

16:01.086 --> 16:04.631
- Do you have anything going on tonight?
- What's that supposed to mean?

16:04.715 --> 16:06.800
It means, do you have anything
going on tonight?

16:06.884 --> 16:10.387
My parents are out of town,
so my Portuguese nanny will make dinner.

16:10.429 --> 16:14.766
Then I'll get back to reading The lliad
or we'll play Monopoly. I always crush her.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.102
I was thinking
you may want to stay for dinner.

16:17.186 --> 16:19.229
- Here?
- Yeah. We have a ton of food...

16:19.313 --> 16:22.524
and it's a whole big show.
If you're not doing anything...

16:22.608 --> 16:25.402
Rereading The lliad a third time
is not 'not doing anything. '

16:25.444 --> 16:27.196
- I'm not pathetic.
- I know you're not.

16:27.279 --> 16:31.241
- I just thought it might be fun, that's all.
- I'll have to make a call.

16:31.325 --> 16:34.411
- Good, make it.
- I just have to let Nanny know.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.129
- Hey.
- Hello, there.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.176
Hey, Clara.
Nice. Is that a Stella McCartney?

16:49.343 --> 16:51.553
- It's a Wal-Mart.
- Well, it's very pretty.

16:51.637 --> 16:54.181
- My mom bought it for tonight.
- She's got good taste.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.475
- I didn't know he was coming.
- Who?

16:56.517 --> 16:58.810
- Jess.
- Yeah. Is that a problem?

16:58.894 --> 16:59.978
Not really.

17:00.479 --> 17:03.482
It's just that he got into this fight
with this guy at school.

17:03.524 --> 17:06.318
- When I broke it up, he started in on me.
- He hit you?

17:06.401 --> 17:08.362
- He tried.
- Why would he do that?

17:08.444 --> 17:10.864
Don't ask me to explain that jerk.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.660
He'd better not do that all night.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.162
No! It tastes too 20th-century, guys.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.665
It's got to shout, 'Washington Irving! '
Not, 'Irving, my accountant. '

17:20.707 --> 17:23.252
It needs something. Help me. What is it?

17:24.002 --> 17:26.547
- What?
- Rune naked, naked Rune.

17:27.256 --> 17:29.758
These stupid pants
won't go past my thighs.

17:29.842 --> 17:32.511
- Why are you dressing in here?
- The bathrooms are full...

17:32.594 --> 17:35.430
and the madrigal singers
are bogarting the supply closet.

17:35.514 --> 17:36.682
This is the only place.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.268
- They're too small.
- My thighs are too big.

17:40.435 --> 17:44.398
In lieu of coming up with something
to reduce the size of your thighs...

17:44.481 --> 17:46.441
why don't we
get you a bigger pair of pants?

17:46.525 --> 17:48.694
- And a different place to dress.
- Definitely.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.613
- Can you get me the supply closet?
- We'll take it by force.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.991
Go. Oh, God.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.788
- Is everything under control?
- Yeah.

17:59.872 --> 18:03.876
No. This needs something,
and I cannot think of what it is.

18:04.626 --> 18:08.881
It's that tart, kind of spicy, white... Salt!

18:09.173 --> 18:11.675
- The word is 'salt'!
- You forgot the word for 'salt'?

18:11.758 --> 18:14.011
- Everything's under control.
- Good.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.431
- Absolutely, 100%.
- You're exuding confidence.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.476
- Have the oxygen ready.
- Easy. It's a bird.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.401
- They're here.
- Who?

18:29.484 --> 18:30.652
The Joyless Luck Club.

18:30.736 --> 18:33.572
Hello, girls.
You look particularly lovely tonight.

18:33.655 --> 18:34.948
Thanks, Grandpa.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.742
You guys look nice yourselves.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.785
Seems like the occasion called for it.

18:38.869 --> 18:41.413
The air seems crisper here than Hartford.
It's wonderful.

18:41.497 --> 18:44.625
Dad, you didn't grab
the wrong prescription bottle, did you?

18:44.708 --> 18:45.959
- What?
- Nothing.

18:46.043 --> 18:48.420
I think she was making
one of her funny jokes.

18:48.504 --> 18:51.465
- Went straight over my head.
- Let me get someone to help you.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.258
No, just point me to the room.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.345
You guys are in Room 31.
Best room in the place.

18:56.428 --> 18:59.765
Anything's fine. I'll see you in a bit.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.896
- What got into him?
- He's totally different.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.981
I know. He's been that way for two days.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.151
I have no idea why,
but I'm taking the credit.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.616
A hostess's job is never done. Hi.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.928
Everybody, will you gather round?

19:38.971 --> 19:41.181
Everyone. First, I want to welcome you...

19:41.265 --> 19:43.934
to the first annual
and probably never to be held again...

19:43.976 --> 19:46.812
as Sookie's close to a nervous breakdown,
Bracebridge dinner.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.689
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

19:48.939 --> 19:53.360
I also thank Mother Nature for snowing in
the Trelling Paper Company in Chicago...

19:53.443 --> 19:56.446
so I could throw this great party
for all my friends instead.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.240
It's a very special night, so...

19:58.323 --> 20:01.910
since I don't get to eat
unbelievably strange food...

20:01.994 --> 20:05.122
with my friends every day,
I've arranged a little surprise.

20:05.164 --> 20:08.542
Outside, as we speak,
is a line of horse-drawn sleighs...

20:08.625 --> 20:10.335
and everybody gets a ride.

20:13.714 --> 20:16.675
So line up and keep it orderly.
There's two per sleigh.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.303
No cutting in front of each other.
That goes for all.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.931
Except me, 'cause I'll be damned
if I miss a ride in a horse-drawn sleigh.

20:23.015 --> 20:26.059
- You gonna go?
- I think I'll wait for the clog dancing.

20:26.185 --> 20:29.396
- Don't move.
- We're gonna miss all the good horses.

20:29.479 --> 20:32.274
Who is this brazen woman
competing for your attention?

20:32.357 --> 20:33.525
Come on!

20:33.609 --> 20:36.403
- I guess I'm spoken for.
- I'll see you back here.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.911
You see the horses?

20:44.077 --> 20:47.456
You mean the ones three feet
from my face? Yeah. I saw them.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.791
I spent a summer
training horses in Montana.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.211
You get kicked in the head a lot?

20:52.252 --> 20:56.048
- Just the once.
- Hey, you in the belt, get in.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.968
No, I was just sort of checking things out.

21:00.052 --> 21:03.013
Come on. We could pull a Ben-Hur
and take down Taylor's sleigh.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.557
- I don't know.
- Come on, Luke.

21:05.599 --> 21:08.769
I can't be all schoolmarmy
and ride by myself. Please?

21:08.852 --> 21:10.229
Well, okay.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.694
Giddyap.

21:20.322 --> 21:23.325
The horses heard me.
I speak horse language. I'm Dr. Dolittle.

21:23.408 --> 21:26.578
Plus, I think the driver of the sleigh
heard you.

21:28.413 --> 21:32.251
I gotta say, sleigh rides are a little much,
but these horses are beautiful.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.962
- Especially from this angle.
- Not just from this angle.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.923
Seriously. Don't backtrack.
Horse has got a nice butt there.

21:37.965 --> 21:40.050
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Nice firm heinie.

21:40.092 --> 21:42.719
Stop talking about the horse's heinie.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.849
The town looks beautiful.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.059
- Same as always.
- No...

21:49.101 --> 21:52.020
it's always different this time of year.
It's magical.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.605
If you say so, sure.

21:53.689 --> 21:55.941
There's the magical
plumbing supply store...

21:55.983 --> 21:58.402
where I bought a magical float
for my toilet.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.988
- You disappoint me.
- Look, the magical Luke's Diner...

22:01.071 --> 22:03.448
right below the apartment
that Jess magically lit...

22:03.490 --> 22:06.952
- by leaving every stinking light on.
- How's it going with you guys?

22:06.994 --> 22:09.496
- Me and Jess? Great.
- Great? Really?

22:09.788 --> 22:12.499
- Well, good.
- It is good.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.961
I mean, it was hard at first,
seemed impossible, you know...

22:16.003 --> 22:18.881
but I've learned a lot
these last couple of months.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.342
- Like?
- Like last week...

22:22.426 --> 22:25.971
- I discovered the secret of parenting.
- You did?

22:26.388 --> 22:29.183
- The secret of parenting?
- The secret of parenting.

22:29.266 --> 22:31.977
- When last week? Last Tuesday?
- I don't know the exact day.

22:32.019 --> 22:34.688
Tuesday at 5:15?
Is that when you discovered it?

22:34.771 --> 22:35.981
Don't mock.

22:36.023 --> 22:38.483
Well, tell me. What is...

22:38.525 --> 22:41.945
- Wait. It's a secret. You can't tell me.
- No, I'll tell you.

22:41.987 --> 22:46.033
- You visualize the reality you want.
- Visualize the reality you want.

22:46.116 --> 22:49.495
And then if necessary,
you lie to bring it about.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.955
That is so much worse
than I was expecting.

22:51.997 --> 22:53.832
You never lied to your kid?

22:54.625 --> 22:57.169
To save her from great physical pain, yes.

22:57.252 --> 23:00.506
When she was little and she'd play
in the kitchen, I told her...

23:00.589 --> 23:02.508
the burners were the deviI's hands.

23:02.591 --> 23:04.510
I'd say it in a scary evangelist voice.

23:04.593 --> 23:07.471
'Don't touch the deviI's hands. '
She still doesn't go near it.

23:07.513 --> 23:10.599
Exactly. You told a white lie
for your kid's protection...

23:10.682 --> 23:13.602
- very similar to what I have done.
- Which was?

23:13.685 --> 23:15.812
- You know the winter break is coming.
- I do.

23:15.896 --> 23:18.315
It means Jess has
some time off from school.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.567
His mom knew that, and she never called.

23:20.651 --> 23:22.152
That makes me sick.

23:22.194 --> 23:25.322
So I decided to keep Jess with me.
I told him...

23:25.364 --> 23:27.449
that his mom wanted him to come home.

23:27.533 --> 23:30.327
But since he just got there
and he was still adjusting...

23:30.369 --> 23:33.497
that I thought he should stay.
His mom was really upset...

23:33.580 --> 23:36.375
but I insisted.
He bought it hook, line, and sinker.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.377
Saved him a lot of hurt.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.549
- He didn't buy it.
- What? Of course he did.

23:45.968 --> 23:47.219
He knows.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.809
I wish Lorelai had warned us about this.

23:53.892 --> 23:56.937
- What? This is wonderful.
- It's wreaking havoc with my hair.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.982
This is not bad for your hair,
compared to the other thing.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.400
What other thing?

24:01.733 --> 24:04.194
Richard, stop it!

24:04.236 --> 24:07.072
- Suddenly you're two years old.
- I'm just having fun.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.908
- I'm not complaining.
- This is fun, too.

24:10.284 --> 24:12.995
- This is like a roller coaster.
- A little.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.831
Say, when was the last time
we were on a roller coaster?

24:15.914 --> 24:17.916
- Never.
- Didn't we ever go to Coney Island?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.960
That must have been your other wife.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.045
I used to love it when I was a kid.

24:22.087 --> 24:25.048
- They were a lot faster then, too.
- And less safe.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.341
We should go on one.

24:26.425 --> 24:27.968
- What?
- A fast one.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.846
You go, and I'll wait
and hold your cotton candy for you.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.056
- You are going.
- It would take a whole day.

24:33.098 --> 24:34.975
- You are going.
- I'd be scared.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.810
I'll hold your hand.

24:37.186 --> 24:40.063
- Fine. We'll go on a roller coaster.
- Good.

24:40.731 --> 24:43.066
Where is this roller coaster
we're going on?

24:43.108 --> 24:44.484
I'm not sure.

24:44.568 --> 24:47.821
I'll get Rory to look it up
on the Internet for us.

24:49.948 --> 24:52.409
- That it, miss?
- I guess I'm alone.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.334
What are you doing?

25:00.417 --> 25:03.128
I heard it was two to a sleigh,
no more, no less.

25:03.170 --> 25:05.839
- You're breaking the rules.
- You could've hurt yourself.

25:05.923 --> 25:08.175
I live on the edge.
I could jump out if you want.

25:08.258 --> 25:11.011
- It doesn't matter to me.
- You mad at me or something?

25:11.094 --> 25:13.972
- What do you think?
- I can't read your mind.

25:14.389 --> 25:16.558
- You got into a fight with Dean.
- Dean?

25:16.642 --> 25:18.018
My boyfriend.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.687
- He's still your boyfriend?
- You can jump out now.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.689
I wasn't fighting him. It was someone else.

25:22.773 --> 25:25.275
- He jumped in on his own.
- He was trying to help you.

25:25.359 --> 25:28.445
He should go into government service
if he likes helping people.

25:28.529 --> 25:30.155
But me, he can stop worrying about.

25:30.239 --> 25:33.867
- Why were you fighting in the first place?
- 'Cause Chuck Presby's a jerk.

25:33.951 --> 25:36.954
You were fighting Chuck Presby?
He is a jerk.

25:37.621 --> 25:40.332
This whole town is weird and full of jerks.

25:40.374 --> 25:43.460
- Then why are you still here?
- What do you mean?

25:43.836 --> 25:47.506
I mean, schooI's out. You don't like it here,
so why don't you just go home?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.132
My mom didn't want me to.

25:49.216 --> 25:51.927
- I don't believe that.
- That's your right, I guess.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.346
Did Luke say she didn't want you to?

25:54.429 --> 25:57.516
Luke told me it was his idea
that I should stay.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.644
It wasn't his idea.

26:03.438 --> 26:04.982
- That's good.
- What?

26:05.065 --> 26:07.317
Your snowman. Snowwoman, actually.

26:07.359 --> 26:10.696
- You know which one's ours?
- It definitely has the most personality.

26:10.779 --> 26:14.366
- Kind of looks like BjÖrk.
- That's what we were going for.

26:14.449 --> 26:17.119
Everyone thinks the one on the end
will be the winner.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.872
- Really? It's so overdone.
- I agree.

26:19.913 --> 26:22.124
- You should win.
- No argument.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.879
- What do you and Dean talk about?
- What?

26:26.920 --> 26:29.006
I mean, does he know BjÖrk?

26:29.089 --> 26:31.175
I've played him some stuff.

26:31.550 --> 26:34.052
So you got a teacher-student thing going.

26:34.136 --> 26:36.638
- Stop.
- No, really, I'm curious.

26:36.722 --> 26:38.891
- What do you guys talk about?
- Everything.

26:38.974 --> 26:42.394
- Like...
- Everything. Tons of stuff. Whatever.

26:42.436 --> 26:45.898
It's just that in the brief,
non-pugilistic time I've spent with him...

26:45.981 --> 26:48.609
he just doesn't seem like your kind of guy.

26:48.692 --> 26:52.613
Well, he is my kind of guy.
He's exactly my kind of guy.

26:53.906 --> 26:56.867
- Guess I don't know him that well.
- You don't.

27:01.747 --> 27:03.707
Quiet, please, everybody.

27:04.291 --> 27:07.252
Before the button-popping
and the bloating can commence...

27:07.336 --> 27:09.713
- say 'cheese. '
- Cheese.

27:12.758 --> 27:15.427
Ladies and gentlemen,
Damen und Herren...

27:15.511 --> 27:18.180
the moment you've been waiting for.

27:18.347 --> 27:21.099
I give you the Bracebridge dinner.

27:21.141 --> 27:24.394
Hold it.
We just need a quick minute, please.

27:25.521 --> 27:28.440
Which will be starting in one quick minute.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.652
Ever think about that?
You can't have a quick minute...

27:31.735 --> 27:34.363
- because it's always 60 seconds.
- Shut up.

27:34.446 --> 27:38.283
Lorelai, darling, who is the silver fox
with the tight knee socks?

27:38.367 --> 27:41.078
That's Claude.
He's one of our regular servers.

27:41.119 --> 27:45.374
- Divorced and on the market.
- The uniform is interesting.

27:45.457 --> 27:48.293
I'll have him bathed, powdered,
and sent to your room.

27:48.335 --> 27:50.796
What? You joke?

27:51.713 --> 27:53.298
Was that a joke?

27:54.925 --> 27:56.510
Lorelai, this is just beautiful.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.846
It's like something
out of Architectural Digest.

27:58.929 --> 28:00.889
- You should be very proud.
- Thanks, Dad.

28:00.973 --> 28:03.684
- Your dress needs pressing.
- Thanks, Mom.

28:04.977 --> 28:07.563
Your pod grandpa's still happy as a clam.

28:07.646 --> 28:10.607
- I told you this would be good.
- When you're right, you're right.

28:10.649 --> 28:13.485
Welcome, lords and ladies.

28:13.777 --> 28:17.614
I call upon these sprightly horns
to commence our proceedings.

28:25.497 --> 28:27.457
Chuck Mangione,
you want to back up a step?

28:27.499 --> 28:28.500
And we're off.

28:28.584 --> 28:32.921
And now, fair people,
I present my lord and master...

28:33.130 --> 28:35.507
the honorable Squire Bracebridge.

28:43.849 --> 28:47.769
Lo! Now has come our joyfullest feast.

28:47.895 --> 28:49.855
Let every man be jolly.

28:50.814 --> 28:53.317
We should have eaten before we came.

28:54.735 --> 28:58.447
Humble servant, bring us
the first course to dine with pleasure.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.491
Methinks it be a butternut squash soup.

29:00.532 --> 29:02.993
Methinks you're right, Squire.
Thus and verily.

29:03.035 --> 29:04.036
And verily thus.

29:04.119 --> 29:06.497
They're the Old England
Abbott and Costello.

29:06.538 --> 29:08.999
'Tis perfection, but extremely hot.

29:09.041 --> 29:12.294
My lord, you need aid.
Wouldst thou have thee ice thy tongue?

29:12.377 --> 29:16.006
Nay, Rune.
To the guests, thou shalt serve the soup!

29:19.510 --> 29:22.721
- What's the white stuff?
- I think it's cheese or cream.

29:22.763 --> 29:26.099
- And the green stuff?
- I think it's best picked off.

29:26.642 --> 29:30.479
- No one says grace?
- I think they all do, Mama. Silently.

29:31.730 --> 29:35.067
- Did you say silent grace?
- Good one.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.406
Soup for my ladies?

29:41.490 --> 29:44.535
- Why, thank you, kind sir.
- Hey, Kirk, nice blouse.

29:44.618 --> 29:46.912
Don't let her make fun of you.
You look great.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.832
Soup with garlands gay, and rosemary.

29:49.915 --> 29:52.459
You're gonna stay in character
no matter what.

29:52.543 --> 29:55.295
It is hot, so proceed daintily.

29:55.379 --> 29:59.174
Did you ever see that I love Lucy
where she goes to Buckingham Palace?

29:59.550 --> 30:02.845
She tries to get the palace guard
to break character. That was funny.

30:02.928 --> 30:05.264
- 'Tis foreign to me, good lady.
- Hang in there.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.391
The ones when she was in Europe
were the best.

30:07.474 --> 30:11.395
- No way, the Hollywood ones. Damn!
- I was rooting for you, boy.

30:19.194 --> 30:21.613
My lord, shall dessert be served?

30:21.947 --> 30:23.782
Anon, humble servant.

30:24.366 --> 30:28.620
- Can I eat my dessert with the horses?
- Sure, but put your coat on.

30:30.956 --> 30:32.416
Are you okay?

30:32.875 --> 30:36.420
I guess so. I've lost track
of how many beers I've had.

30:36.837 --> 30:38.005
Seven.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.842
- Paris, how's it going?
- Fine. Good.

30:41.925 --> 30:43.927
- Thanks for having me.
- It was our pleasure.

30:44.011 --> 30:45.971
- Did you notice the anachronisms?
- The what?

30:46.054 --> 30:48.682
The period discrepancies.
They were pretty blatant.

30:48.765 --> 30:51.768
Forget that the 19th century
didn't include recessed lighting...

30:51.852 --> 30:53.979
or the Fossil watch
your server was wearing.

30:54.062 --> 30:57.316
But water in that period would not
have been served with cubed ice.

30:57.399 --> 30:59.651
Your servers are wearing
nylon blend shirts.

30:59.693 --> 31:02.654
Nylon was invented by a scientist
at DuPont in the 1920s.

31:02.738 --> 31:04.781
It shattered the illusion.

31:04.823 --> 31:07.159
Floggings will be administered.

31:07.242 --> 31:11.163
So there we are,
it's a beautiful moonlit Prague night...

31:11.205 --> 31:13.707
and we're strolling across
the Charles Bridge...

31:13.790 --> 31:15.709
when we come across this group of kids...

31:15.792 --> 31:19.004
blasting this song by that awful woman.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.714
Who is she? The tall, bony one...

31:20.797 --> 31:23.967
married to the deceased
mustachioed Congressman.

31:24.009 --> 31:25.302
- Cher?
- That's the one.

31:25.344 --> 31:27.429
The year of
Do you believe in life after love?

31:27.513 --> 31:28.805
A difficult time for all of us.

31:28.847 --> 31:31.350
- I like that song.
- I was appalled.

31:31.433 --> 31:34.770
Prague has played host to some
of the greatest composers in history.

31:34.853 --> 31:38.815
Mozart named a symphony after it,
for heaven's sake. So what did I do?

31:38.857 --> 31:43.403
- I've tried so hard to forget this.
- I stood beside them and their boom box...

31:43.487 --> 31:47.074
and I hummed Mozart's Prague Symphony
as loud as I could.

31:50.619 --> 31:53.914
- The bizarro Battle of the Bands.
- And did it work?

31:53.997 --> 31:56.667
They quickly packed up
and went their way.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.628
But then he kept on humming the Mozart.
He wouldn't stop.

31:59.711 --> 32:03.507
I was hoping for some gullible tourists
to drop money at my feet.

32:03.549 --> 32:05.884
- Two of them did.
- And I kept it!

32:07.469 --> 32:10.722
This might be the most interesting
conversation I've ever had...

32:10.764 --> 32:12.724
- with an insurance man.
- I'm hurt.

32:12.808 --> 32:14.726
I'm sorry. What I meant was that...

32:14.810 --> 32:18.981
What you meant was that people
in the insurance industry are drones.

32:19.273 --> 32:23.360
I agree. They are a dull lot,
and I am glad to be rid of them.

32:24.570 --> 32:25.946
Rid of them?

32:26.363 --> 32:28.323
Are you retired, Richard?

32:30.033 --> 32:32.161
Of course he's not. Richard?

32:35.080 --> 32:36.582
Actually, I am.

32:45.799 --> 32:50.470
It's nice to end a big, festive meal with
a big festive pall hanging over the room.

32:50.554 --> 32:52.723
- Most people didn't notice anything.
- Yeah.

32:52.764 --> 32:56.101
I guess Bootsy singing Hotel California
accompanied by spoons...

32:56.185 --> 32:57.769
drew people's attention away.

32:57.853 --> 33:00.898
Did Grandma and Grandpa
say a word to each other after that?

33:00.981 --> 33:02.107
Why didn't he tell anyone?

33:02.191 --> 33:04.985
Are you asking me
to interpret my parents' motives?

33:05.068 --> 33:07.196
My mistake. So which bed do you want?

33:07.279 --> 33:09.698
- Take the one by the window.
- Okay.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.452
- Mom!
- What, honey?

33:13.494 --> 33:15.787
You put the ugly baby's picture in my bed.

33:15.829 --> 33:17.456
I didn't. I swear.

33:17.539 --> 33:19.583
That ugly baby is stalking us. Run away.

33:19.666 --> 33:22.002
- Poor baby. It's not his fault.
- I think it's a she.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.796
Poor baby. You picked the wrong parents.

33:26.006 --> 33:28.425
Have you heard from Dad recently?

33:30.469 --> 33:32.304
- What dad? Your dad?
- Yeah, my dad.

33:32.387 --> 33:33.472
Why?

33:33.555 --> 33:36.808
Because he's my dad, and he usually
checks in this time of year...

33:36.892 --> 33:40.312
and he hasn't checked in yet.
I know he's probably busy with Sherry...

33:40.354 --> 33:42.439
and the new apartment... What?

33:42.481 --> 33:44.316
There may have been a call.

33:44.399 --> 33:46.443
There may have been?
You don't remember?

33:46.485 --> 33:49.488
Things have been so hectic
with the Bracebridge dinner...

33:49.571 --> 33:53.200
and building a snowwoman. And planning
the ugly baby gag, that took time.

33:53.283 --> 33:54.993
- Mom...
- Yes, he called.

33:55.077 --> 33:58.288
He called and invited you
and it's not too late to go.

33:58.330 --> 34:02.376
He called and invited you. There you go.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, so there.

34:02.459 --> 34:04.837
- He invited me over?
- Yes, are you deaf?

34:04.878 --> 34:07.840
No, I'm trying to separate the gist
from the...

34:07.923 --> 34:11.176
- The gist is he invited you.
- Why didn't he invite me himself?

34:11.217 --> 34:14.054
He's pretending to be considerate
by running it past me first.

34:14.137 --> 34:17.349
Was he maybe not pretending
and actually being considerate?

34:17.431 --> 34:20.185
Maybe. But I wouldn't put it past him
to be inconsiderate.

34:20.268 --> 34:23.188
- He doesn't have a great track record.
- Why didn't you tell me?

34:23.272 --> 34:25.732
He may be waiting for my answer,
holding off his plans.

34:25.815 --> 34:29.777
Because I have dibs on this time of year
with you. Not him, me.

34:29.862 --> 34:32.947
He acknowledged that
and that was cool, but still, it stinks.

34:33.031 --> 34:35.617
Because he put me
in a very difficult position.

34:35.701 --> 34:39.204
We were supposed to watch a lot
of movies and make fun of Godfather III.

34:39.288 --> 34:41.706
The thing that I really hate about this...

34:41.748 --> 34:45.377
is the idea of you not hanging out with me
'cause you're hanging out there...

34:45.460 --> 34:47.588
with your stupid stepmother.

34:47.713 --> 34:50.549
- You're calling Sherry my stepmother?
- She practically is.

34:50.591 --> 34:53.051
- You're wigging.
- There's something wrong with her.

34:53.135 --> 34:55.596
- You don't even know her.
- You think I'm overreacting?

34:55.679 --> 34:58.307
- I think you're jealous of Sherry.
- I'm not jealous.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.851
But I understand.
Your territory has been threatened.

35:00.934 --> 35:02.436
- Excuse me?
- Relax.

35:02.519 --> 35:06.523
There are ways to work through these
situations. Compromises can be struck.

35:06.565 --> 35:09.776
- What are you saying?
- I can still call you 'Mom'...

35:09.860 --> 35:12.738
- and I'll call her 'Mommy Sherry. '
- Don't be mean.

35:12.821 --> 35:16.617
We can split up holidays evenly.
Like I'll be with you on Labor Day...

35:16.700 --> 35:17.868
- her on Memorial Day.
- Enough.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.536
I'll have to find out her religion...

35:19.620 --> 35:21.413
to see how Hanukkah will factor into this.

35:21.497 --> 35:24.541
Unless you want to convert to Judaism,
take Hanukkah for yourself.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.919
I get the point. I overreacted. Please stop.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.546
You totally overreacted. God.

35:34.134 --> 35:36.428
You think you're gonna go
and stay with them?

35:36.470 --> 35:37.554
I'll think about it.

35:37.638 --> 35:39.723
Do you have to think
because it's killing me...

35:39.765 --> 35:42.309
not to know your plans,
and you want to torture me?

35:42.392 --> 35:44.895
Nope. I just don't know if I want to do it.

35:46.313 --> 35:49.316
- It was nice of him to ask, though.
- It was very nice.

35:49.399 --> 35:52.277
- 'Cause we are rooting for Dad.
- We are rooting for him.

35:52.361 --> 35:56.114
It was a very nice thing
that Christopher offered.

35:56.615 --> 35:58.033
I was being a little possessive.

35:58.116 --> 36:00.244
And insanely jealous
of his pretty girlfriend.

36:00.327 --> 36:02.246
I want to know
if she's good enough for him.

36:02.287 --> 36:03.330
Me, too.

36:03.413 --> 36:05.666
So there was an altruistic streak
to my madness.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.417
I'll go with that.

36:11.797 --> 36:13.382
I need a new room.

36:13.465 --> 36:15.801
- What?
- I can't stay in that room.

36:16.468 --> 36:19.346
- There are no other rooms.
- Then I'll go home.

36:19.429 --> 36:21.348
- Grandma, it's late.
- And pitch black.

36:21.431 --> 36:24.935
- The roads are icy. You can't drive.
- I'm not going back to that room.

36:25.018 --> 36:27.020
You and Dad had it out
about the job thing?

36:27.104 --> 36:30.274
We haven't even spoken. I'm so upset
I wouldn't know where to start.

36:30.315 --> 36:33.861
I couldn't take being around him anymore.
What he did is inexcusable.

36:33.944 --> 36:37.447
Not letting me know he left his job,
as if it didn't affect me.

36:37.531 --> 36:41.326
Mom, try to calm down.
Take this bed, and Rory and I will share.

36:41.368 --> 36:44.246
- I'm just a burden.
- You're not a burden, Mom.

36:45.289 --> 36:46.957
Okay. Thank you.

36:47.332 --> 36:49.585
Can I use the mirror in the bathroom
for a second?

36:49.668 --> 36:51.712
Yes. I'll use the one out here.

37:04.308 --> 37:06.268
- What?
- Behold my future.

37:10.856 --> 37:13.817
- How do you turn off the light?
- I'll get it.

37:15.027 --> 37:16.987
I still can't believe it.

37:17.237 --> 37:18.655
Try to relax, Mom.

37:18.697 --> 37:21.825
I hope he doesn't sleep,
because I surely won't.

37:22.701 --> 37:25.746
These slippers you have here
are hardly one size fits all.

37:25.829 --> 37:27.998
- They're too big.
- Good night.

37:34.004 --> 37:35.964
It was so irresponsible.

37:36.882 --> 37:38.509
Maybe he had no choice.

37:38.592 --> 37:41.678
Of course he had a choice.
Go to sleep, Lorelai.

37:41.845 --> 37:44.056
That job was killing him, Mom.

37:45.057 --> 37:46.767
It was killing him.

37:55.818 --> 37:57.945
I'm going for a little walk.

37:58.111 --> 38:00.614
- Grandma, it's late.
- I'm not tired.

38:03.283 --> 38:07.704
Like sands through the hourglass,
so are the Gilmores of our lives.

38:16.255 --> 38:18.632
- I didn't know you were here.
- Emily, don't go.

38:18.715 --> 38:21.802
- I'm very tired.
- I want to talk to you. Please.

38:31.979 --> 38:35.607
I don't need to remind you
about how I've been feeling at work.

38:35.691 --> 38:38.777
My frustration
just built to the point where...

38:39.611 --> 38:41.405
Again, you know this.

38:43.115 --> 38:47.369
So I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday
just to talk about the situation...

38:47.452 --> 38:49.955
and about the rumors I had heard
floating around.

38:50.038 --> 38:53.292
So I met with Floyd.
We shook hands, had coffee...

38:53.333 --> 38:57.087
and then I started telling him
about how unhappy I'd become.

38:57.796 --> 39:01.884
I detailed all my years with the company,
all the travel I'd done...

39:01.967 --> 39:04.803
all the weekends I'd put in,
the sacrifices I had made...

39:04.887 --> 39:07.431
including time with my family,
for the firm.

39:07.514 --> 39:10.267
The more I talked, the angrier I became.

39:10.642 --> 39:14.021
And then, suddenly, I heard myself resign.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.523
Just like that.

39:18.317 --> 39:19.943
Floyd was stunned.

39:20.819 --> 39:23.030
I'd never seen Floyd stunned.

39:23.655 --> 39:25.991
I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned.

39:26.825 --> 39:29.995
So I finished my coffee
and I walked out of that office...

39:30.078 --> 39:32.498
and I couldn't believe what I had just done.

39:32.539 --> 39:34.249
I'd resigned, quit.

39:34.333 --> 39:37.211
I believe I even used a little profanity
in the process.

39:37.294 --> 39:39.421
But do you know what, Emily?

39:40.631 --> 39:43.258
I was thrilled, elated.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.678
A giant weight
had been lifted off my chest.

39:48.388 --> 39:50.974
I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me...

39:51.016 --> 39:53.936
and I realized
it was because I was smiling.

39:54.645 --> 39:58.023
Nobody had seen me smile there
in a very long time.

39:58.190 --> 40:00.442
I was happy.

40:00.609 --> 40:03.195
And you chose not to tell me,
your own wife?

40:04.780 --> 40:08.325
I know I've done nothing but
disappoint you these past few months...

40:08.408 --> 40:10.327
what with how isolated I've become...

40:10.369 --> 40:12.913
and all the social engagements
I've made you cancel...

40:12.996 --> 40:15.541
and all the friendships I've jeopardized.

40:15.624 --> 40:18.252
And you like order. You like lists.

40:18.335 --> 40:21.338
You like to know where you're going
or what's coming.

40:21.421 --> 40:25.217
You like all things planned.
And then suddenly...

40:25.300 --> 40:28.929
I impulsively unplan our entire future
in one fell swoop.

40:29.221 --> 40:31.682
I couldn't face disappointing you again.

40:31.723 --> 40:35.269
I couldn't face telling you
that I had spoiled the plan.

40:35.435 --> 40:37.896
Not now, not at this time of year.

40:38.897 --> 40:42.192
I didn't want to fight.
I didn't want to worry.

40:43.652 --> 40:46.071
I just wanted to keep being happy.

40:48.532 --> 40:50.409
I'm very sorry.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.289
Anyhow...

40:56.915 --> 41:00.711
I've been sitting here
going over our financial situation.

41:01.086 --> 41:04.214
Now, we still have
all our retirement accounts...

41:04.298 --> 41:06.341
and our medical coverage is all there.

41:06.425 --> 41:10.053
By quitting, we do forego some
of my pension and some stock options.

41:10.137 --> 41:13.098
Not a terribly significant amount,
but an amount all the same.

41:15.559 --> 41:17.352
Let's just go to bed.

41:30.866 --> 41:33.494
- See you, Bootsy.
- See you. Thanks.

41:34.161 --> 41:37.623
By the way, last night,
did I sing Hotel California?

41:37.664 --> 41:40.250
- Right till the end.
- While banging spoons on your head.

41:40.292 --> 41:42.294
- That explains the lumps.
- Bye.

41:42.336 --> 41:45.797
Lorelai, darling, thank you for everything.

41:45.839 --> 41:49.134
Patty, your timing is excellent.
There's Claude over there.

41:49.426 --> 41:50.886
Want me to do some matchmaking?

41:50.969 --> 41:53.931
He's wearing a golf shirt
and cotton Dockers.

41:54.598 --> 41:58.727
- So it was the uniform?
- It's the Biloxi Naval Base all over again.

41:58.977 --> 42:00.312
- Bye.
- See you.

42:03.190 --> 42:06.276
You didn't make it back to the room
last night. Did you get lucky?

42:06.318 --> 42:08.779
- Could you be any cruder?
- Yeah, I could be cruder.

42:08.821 --> 42:11.824
- Mom, did you get...
- Thanks for coming. It was fun.

42:11.907 --> 42:14.243
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's okay.

42:14.326 --> 42:16.328
- We'll see you next Friday.
- Bye.

42:16.787 --> 42:18.455
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Lorelai.

42:19.289 --> 42:22.876
You just had one grog too many.
Just drink lots of water to rehydrate.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.671
- I will.
- Jackson, thank you for being our squire.

42:25.754 --> 42:27.798
You're welcome. By the way...

42:27.881 --> 42:30.342
last night when Bootsy was singing
Hotel California...

42:30.384 --> 42:32.678
and banging spoons on his head, did I...

42:32.761 --> 42:36.265
Lift up your shirt and play drums
on your stomach? Yes, you did.

42:36.348 --> 42:37.933
- You kept a good beat.
- Yeah.

42:38.016 --> 42:40.936
'Cause if the beat was off,
you'd have embarrassed yourself.

42:41.019 --> 42:42.396
Thanks, Rory.

42:42.479 --> 42:45.315
- Clara, I'm glad you came.
- I'll see you later.

42:45.357 --> 42:47.526
- Don't kiss.
- Come on.

42:47.609 --> 42:48.986
Don't kiss.

42:52.531 --> 42:53.532
Come on.

42:53.657 --> 42:56.118
- So I guess we're off.
- I guess so.

43:06.378 --> 43:07.880
Bye, you guys.

43:10.132 --> 43:11.383
Let's go home.

43:11.466 --> 43:14.011
- Are we coming to get our bags later?
- Why?

43:14.052 --> 43:16.430
We're walking home.
I don't want to carry them.

43:16.513 --> 43:18.390
Who says we're walking?

43:22.561 --> 43:26.023
- This is the only way to ride.
- I wholeheartedly agree.

43:28.734 --> 43:31.862
- What happened there?
- I have no idea.

43:32.571 --> 43:36.700
Bad news for ringer guy,
but guess who wins by default?

43:37.367 --> 43:39.369
I guess that would be us.

44:21.286 --> 44:22.287
