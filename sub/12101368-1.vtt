WEBVTT

02:28.010 --> 02:29.379
How long are we staying here?

02:29.380 --> 02:31.029
- Just tonight.

02:31.030 --> 02:32.383
We sleep, we leave.

02:33.906 --> 02:35.859
We meet up with Danny and
Keisha tomorrow in Long Beach.

02:35.860 --> 02:39.189
- Nah, this is a nice
little vacation spot.

02:39.190 --> 02:41.929
I think we should stay
here a few days, you know,

02:41.930 --> 02:44.207
make a fucking baby or
something.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.478
- Yeah?

02:45.479 --> 02:46.977
- Yeah.

02:46.978 --> 02:48.350
- I don't think so.

02:48.351 --> 02:50.473
- Why did we have to come
all the way out here anyway?

02:51.430 --> 02:53.559
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.403
I remember.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.179
'Cause you paid Bird 50K for plans

02:58.180 --> 03:00.533
he already sold to every other crew in LA.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.579
And now they're all after us

03:03.580 --> 03:05.230
thinking that we ripped them off.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.179
Did you know that Denise?

03:08.180 --> 03:09.013
- Oh, shut up.

03:12.788 --> 03:15.733
And you still
want to give that shit a cut?

03:16.780 --> 03:19.427
The only cut that ass cum's going to get,

03:19.428 --> 03:21.204
is to cut his throat.

03:28.210 --> 03:31.463
What'd I do?

03:38.590 --> 03:40.311
This bag's heavy, man.

03:46.497 --> 03:48.050
Goddamn!

03:48.051 --> 03:50.614
God fucking damn.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.799
- Shit.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.839
It's like four...

03:53.840 --> 03:55.569
Four and a half million here?

03:55.570 --> 03:56.720
- Or something like it.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.796
We get Bird his car, we still
clear like two and a half.

04:00.797 --> 04:03.822
- Nah, Polly's got a point.
You don't need to fuck around-

04:03.823 --> 04:04.849
- Don't.

04:04.850 --> 04:06.509
Birthday goodbyes.

04:06.510 --> 04:07.343
- Please.

04:09.020 --> 04:09.953
- Fuck Bird.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.233
Cub-smoking cunt.

04:13.490 --> 04:14.869
No offense, Denise.

04:14.870 --> 04:15.839
- Yup.

04:15.840 --> 04:16.673
- Fucking.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.159
You don't deserve shit but
a clear full hallow chips

04:20.160 --> 04:21.423
of my dick in his mouth.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.606
- Bird gets his cut.

04:25.580 --> 04:26.413
And that's that.

04:27.604 --> 04:29.005
No.

04:29.006 --> 04:32.352
No, this is motherfucking
this, motherfucker.

04:32.353 --> 04:35.469
You fuck around for too many
into that half of faggot.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.509
That's not be bitching out
to the highest caliber bitch

04:37.510 --> 04:40.513
and me, Donny, Denise and Keisha.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.109
Hell.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.010
You can't even walk the block no more.

04:47.772 --> 04:50.222
I can't let you fucking
bitch out like that, man.

04:51.260 --> 04:52.093
- Put it away.

04:55.518 --> 04:56.350
- Or what?

04:56.351 --> 04:58.523
- Or she is so fast,
you'll stink standing.

05:02.016 --> 05:03.566
- I thought you're with me.

05:03.567 --> 05:04.763
- You thought wrong.

05:06.761 --> 05:07.594
I'm with him.

05:09.182 --> 05:10.599
Always have been.

05:21.030 --> 05:24.829
- Oh, I'm trying to see a logic for him.

05:24.830 --> 05:26.780
I guess it's just a little on my right.

05:29.030 --> 05:31.659
There was at time you were
ready to use that shit bag

05:31.660 --> 05:33.293
for target practice and pay him.

05:34.534 --> 05:37.334
- There was also a time you
had two fucking eyes, Polly.

05:39.860 --> 05:41.320
Times change.

05:43.000 --> 05:43.833
You should too.

05:53.285 --> 05:54.118
- Yeah.

05:55.373 --> 05:56.790
Oh yeah, they do.

06:06.340 --> 06:07.853
- Piss bitch!

06:13.100 --> 06:14.023
What's your deal?

06:15.100 --> 06:17.800
You're looking at me sideways
ever since the bank job.

06:18.920 --> 06:19.860
- It's nothing.

06:19.861 --> 06:21.561
Bullshit, it's nothing.

06:24.604 --> 06:26.139
Look, you can't even look me in the eyes

06:26.140 --> 06:27.309
unless you're looking at me all hard

06:27.310 --> 06:29.260
like you want to jump off or some shit.

06:31.880 --> 06:32.713
Hey.

06:34.325 --> 06:35.702
I'm with you.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.830
Motherfucker, I'll ride and die with you.

06:40.073 --> 06:42.268
- I just never seen
that part of you before.

06:43.690 --> 06:45.249
What happened back there?

06:45.250 --> 06:46.599
- That motherfucker went for his piece.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.432
What?

06:47.433 --> 06:48.483
- And the bank tellers?

06:49.360 --> 06:50.429
The manager?

06:50.430 --> 06:51.699
- Bitches.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.139
- The people in line, what about them?

06:54.140 --> 06:55.009
Huh?

06:55.010 --> 06:57.619
- I said if anybody
moves, they'd all get it.

06:57.620 --> 06:58.599
If they did what they did

06:58.600 --> 06:59.929
and I didn't do what I'd say I'd do

06:59.930 --> 07:01.929
if they did what they did, I'd be a liar.

07:01.930 --> 07:03.670
I ain't no fucking liar, Vel.

07:05.745 --> 07:07.299
- I don't know who you are anymore.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.743
- You know exactly who I am.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.383
Killing people doesn't
make me a bad person.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.333
Still me.

07:34.096 --> 07:35.412
- Polly! Polly!

07:35.413 --> 07:36.245
Polly!

07:42.570 --> 07:43.402
Fuck!

07:43.403 --> 07:44.663
Fuck! Fuck!

07:44.664 --> 07:47.334
You can have all the fucking money, man!

07:47.335 --> 07:51.866
I don't care about this fucking-

08:04.084 --> 08:09.084
on the devil's dime

08:12.861 --> 08:17.861
on the green light

08:31.436 --> 08:32.268
- Wow!

08:32.269 --> 08:35.372
- Wow, this is so nice.
- This is good.

08:37.537 --> 08:39.635
Nice.
- This is good.

08:46.450 --> 08:48.873
- Welcome staycation done right.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.327
- Hey, where are you girls headed?

09:06.328 --> 09:07.513
- To find a bed.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.565
- Room.

09:11.290 --> 09:13.309
- Well, bedrooms are down that way,

09:13.310 --> 09:14.619
and then there's a couple
more in the basement

09:14.620 --> 09:16.479
or loft above.

09:16.480 --> 09:17.951
Enjoy.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.139
You gotta be kidding me.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.009
- What?

09:36.010 --> 09:38.129
- Leave them alone, Randy.

09:38.130 --> 09:40.319
No, no, no, Stacy.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.239
They've been doing this shit all day;

09:42.240 --> 09:45.669
teasing, groping, squeezing
on each other, teasing me.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.549
And now I'm supposed to go downstairs,

09:47.550 --> 09:49.359
when I know beyond a shadow of a doubt,

09:49.360 --> 09:51.619
that there's some serious
late night, pay-per-view

09:51.620 --> 09:56.620
tits and ass, vagina-lympics,
69 and scissor fest going on?

09:56.730 --> 09:58.053
It's not fair!

09:58.940 --> 10:00.459
- Deal with it.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.060
- Then you help me deal with it.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.262
'Cause my purple rocket is ready to rage.

10:06.263 --> 10:07.095
Oh Jesus.

10:09.544 --> 10:10.377
- This is nice.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.313
- Leave it off.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.610
- Why?

10:15.611 --> 10:16.823
I want to see your body.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.018
- Yeah, D-day.

10:30.043 --> 10:31.503
- Turn around.

11:02.422 --> 11:03.255
- Hmm.

11:04.683 --> 11:07.850
That's better than mama's breast milk.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.553
- What's going on with us?

11:16.083 --> 11:18.117
I mean, am I the one doing this?

11:24.010 --> 11:24.843
Hey.

11:28.850 --> 11:29.683
Come on.

11:30.650 --> 11:31.693
It's over, Doug.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.723
It's been over for a long time.

11:36.527 --> 11:39.786
Come on, you have to believe me.

11:39.787 --> 11:40.954
Hmm?
- Come on.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.666
Tell me I got nothing to worry about

11:48.667 --> 11:51.444
and I won't kick his fucking teeth out.

11:54.049 --> 11:55.571
- You got nothing to worry about.

11:57.439 --> 11:58.272
- Okay.

11:59.437 --> 12:04.304
- Thank you.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.649
- See, this is why we should
have just stayed in college

12:30.650 --> 12:32.123
and become career students.

12:33.350 --> 12:34.868
- What?

12:34.869 --> 12:35.749
- You know what.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.523
You and her, it's ridiculous.

12:39.150 --> 12:39.982
- It's nothing.

12:39.983 --> 12:41.189
- Look, it's not nothing.

12:41.190 --> 12:42.203
It's something.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.469
And back when you, me, Cass
and Viv used to live together,

12:46.470 --> 12:48.020
this never would have happened.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.049
And you know why.

12:51.050 --> 12:51.979
- Don't.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.269
You know why.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.579
Come on.

12:55.580 --> 12:56.530
What was our motto?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.837
- I ain't saying that shit.

12:59.838 --> 13:00.670
- Come on-

13:00.671 --> 13:01.504
- Nope.
- Say it.

13:02.910 --> 13:05.109
- What's up bitches?

13:05.110 --> 13:07.929
- Oh, shit.

13:07.930 --> 13:11.129
- The blackout brigade days are over, man.

13:11.130 --> 13:12.572
You need to slow down.

13:12.573 --> 13:14.159
You're not 20 anymore.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.012
- Bitch, please. I still
look it.

13:16.013 --> 13:17.879
And the blackout brigade
days are not over,

13:17.880 --> 13:20.305
they're back in full effect.

13:20.306 --> 13:21.139
- Mm-hmm.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.269
- Yeah, so, I hear you're the new...

13:25.270 --> 13:26.829
Scissor Fest champ.

13:29.010 --> 13:30.519
- Vivian-
- It was true.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.419
In college she was taking so much coke

13:32.420 --> 13:33.489
I thought she was a Survivor

13:33.490 --> 13:35.044
stocking up for World War III.

13:35.890 --> 13:38.889
Now she's flashing gash with Tammy,

13:38.890 --> 13:40.639
inquiring minds.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.386
- Oh yeah, well, my
inquiring mind wants to know

13:42.387 --> 13:44.199
about you and Darren.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.209
- There is no me and Darren.

13:46.210 --> 13:48.309
The boy is a pussy.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.569
P-U-S-S-Y.

13:49.570 --> 13:50.799
Eight years and he's still dancing around

13:50.800 --> 13:51.969
asking me out like,

13:56.300 --> 13:58.879
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance,

13:58.880 --> 14:00.479
River Dance...

14:00.480 --> 14:02.279
- Okay.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.179
- You two uncultured sluts.

14:04.180 --> 14:06.249
I should con pond both you off this porch.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.089
- Like, either way, just
stop being a fucking bitch

14:08.090 --> 14:10.089
and go ask him out already.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.519
Why don't you stop leading
him on the way you do?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.319
- Because much like you Liz,

14:13.320 --> 14:16.960
I love the smell of pussy in the morning.

14:16.961 --> 14:19.047
It smells like...

14:24.439 --> 14:25.271
- Disgusting.

14:25.272 --> 14:27.379
- That's fucking nasty. Aw...

14:27.380 --> 14:28.753
- Yeah, it's funny.

14:28.754 --> 14:31.985
- What the fuck is wrong
with you?

14:38.330 --> 14:39.526
Joke on a wiener, fuck cunt.

14:39.527 --> 14:41.272
You
can be such a dick sometimes.

14:57.470 --> 15:00.420
- How much do you say it is
a time to share this cabin?

15:04.930 --> 15:05.763
Doug?

15:08.980 --> 15:10.229
- I don't know.

15:10.230 --> 15:11.493
Two, $300 a month?

15:17.270 --> 15:20.103
It's a five bedroom on a 52 acres of land.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.839
Try more like $2,000.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.290
Let's see, here's the kicker.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.623
Me and Stace,

15:28.870 --> 15:30.526
get it for less than 400.

15:30.527 --> 15:32.846
- Get the outta here.

15:32.847 --> 15:34.449
- No, you get the outta here.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.289
I'm serious.

15:35.290 --> 15:37.420
- How'd you get this place for so little?

15:41.121 --> 15:42.779
See,

15:42.780 --> 15:45.800
this place sat abandoned for
like 20 years or something

15:47.420 --> 15:50.019
before me and the other guy picked it up.

15:50.020 --> 15:53.283
Original owner was some poor
bastard named Paul Talbert.

15:54.402 --> 15:57.769
He was a detective in Big Bear,

15:57.770 --> 15:59.249
Homicide division.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.719
Talbert was investigating
irrational murders

16:01.720 --> 16:03.859
by a serial killer

16:03.860 --> 16:06.379
who became known as a local legend

16:06.380 --> 16:08.239
known as the Axeman at Cutter's Creek.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.866
- Ah shit, that's this cutter's creek?

16:10.867 --> 16:12.117
Yeah.

16:14.150 --> 16:15.143
See, the thing is,

16:17.490 --> 16:18.620
the crime scene report

16:19.480 --> 16:20.580
on the graphic detail,

16:21.565 --> 16:24.699
you know, hands and feet hacked off,

16:24.700 --> 16:26.419
heads split in half,

16:26.420 --> 16:27.769
blood, guts and shattered bones,

16:27.770 --> 16:29.749
I mean the axeman slashed
his way through the woods

16:29.750 --> 16:31.983
and into the town's history.

16:33.513 --> 16:35.999
In one report, coroner asked,

16:36.000 --> 16:37.850
you know, how many body bags to bring

16:38.735 --> 16:40.669
and Talbert said, "Just bring
them up in a fucking bucket."

16:40.670 --> 16:42.259
I mean...

16:42.260 --> 16:43.609
it wasn't a large enough chunk in the meat

16:43.610 --> 16:46.113
to identify whether
there was male or female.

16:48.150 --> 16:51.659
So I mean, this killings
spread all across town

16:51.660 --> 16:55.183
and cops told everybody
to stay in after sundown.

16:58.570 --> 17:00.669
See, then they start finding people

17:00.670 --> 17:02.193
hacked up in their own homes.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.483
Talbert comes home,

17:09.170 --> 17:11.449
to his wife and kids one night,

17:11.450 --> 17:14.479
and inside he finds them
hacked to burger patties.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.083
- Oh God.

17:17.220 --> 17:18.609
Yeah.

17:18.610 --> 17:19.473
And he loses it.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.769
Grabs his own ax,

17:21.770 --> 17:24.009
runs off in the woods, screaming
at the top of his lungs

17:24.010 --> 17:26.419
saying he found the
axeman that cut his creek.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.853
The Axeman beside him.

17:29.310 --> 17:30.143
Sad assault.

18:06.730 --> 18:07.929
- Oh!

18:07.930 --> 18:09.519
- Chill squirrel, it's just me.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.489
I came to see what's taking you so long-

18:11.490 --> 18:12.453
Holy shit.

18:13.330 --> 18:14.729
Oh, were you about to spank it to Vivian?

18:14.730 --> 18:16.639
Oh, how were you gonna spank it to Vivian?

18:16.640 --> 18:17.472
- Dude, I don't even
have my dick in my hand.

18:17.473 --> 18:18.779
What are you talking about?

18:18.780 --> 18:20.649
- Oh, I don't need my dick in
my hand to rub one out, dude.

18:20.650 --> 18:21.550
.

18:23.050 --> 18:25.739
But sometimes I want
it over the top action.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.769
Most times it's shuffling
dice, shuffling dice.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.539
Oh dude, let's both spank to Vivian,

18:29.540 --> 18:31.495
high five and make a grilled G sandwich-

18:31.496 --> 18:32.328
- Yeah, I'm getting out of here-

18:32.329 --> 18:33.162
- Oh, it's gooey.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.623
Repressed.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.563
Where is she, Peter Meter?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.712
Ah, you're killing me!

20:22.047 --> 20:26.419
Hey, funny
seeing you here.

20:26.420 --> 20:29.769
I was, kind of hoping I
can go on a run with you

20:29.770 --> 20:30.620
if that was cool.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.473
- Sure.

20:38.900 --> 20:39.929
This way.

20:39.930 --> 20:42.845
- Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.133
- Cass?

21:19.750 --> 21:20.583
- Stace?

21:30.664 --> 21:31.497
So...

21:33.759 --> 21:34.592
- So?

21:37.340 --> 21:39.363
- How can you have nothing to say to me?

21:40.580 --> 21:41.476
- What would he have to say to you?

21:41.477 --> 21:42.309
- You know what?

21:42.310 --> 21:44.413
I'm talking to Brian right now, hun.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.029
Nothing to say?

21:48.030 --> 21:49.799
- About what Cassidy?

21:49.800 --> 21:50.950
What the hell did I do?

21:52.160 --> 21:54.480
You're the one that left me,
remember? Did you forget that?

21:55.280 --> 21:56.283
- Why her, Brian?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.232
Why Stacy?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.869
Why did you have to go
after my best friend?

22:00.870 --> 22:02.659
What, are you brain-fucked?

22:02.660 --> 22:04.339
I didn't choose her.

22:04.340 --> 22:05.172
Right, she chose me.

22:05.173 --> 22:06.493
Oh, the hell she did.

22:07.710 --> 22:09.360
You didn't go after him, did you?

22:11.380 --> 22:12.212
Look Cassidy,

22:12.213 --> 22:14.459
I don't know how to break this to you,

22:14.460 --> 22:17.949
but Brian is an amazing guy, okay?

22:17.950 --> 22:21.834
He's a great guy, that
you took for granted.

22:21.835 --> 22:23.169
- Oh my God.

22:23.170 --> 22:24.919
I should have known, you have always been

22:24.920 --> 22:27.161
after my sloppy seconds.

22:27.162 --> 22:27.994
Really?

22:27.995 --> 22:29.339
Really?
- Really?

22:29.340 --> 22:31.819
Okay Cass, get over yourself!

22:31.820 --> 22:33.993
And while you're at it, get over Brian!

22:35.720 --> 22:37.399
- You know what?

22:37.400 --> 22:39.599
You just can't stand the fact

22:39.600 --> 22:42.149
that I had something that you can't.

22:42.150 --> 22:42.982
And you know what?

22:42.983 --> 22:44.163
I am over him.

22:45.810 --> 22:47.623
- No, you're not.

22:49.030 --> 22:49.930
- Baby, you're up.

22:51.010 --> 22:51.842
Doug.

22:51.843 --> 22:52.949
No.

22:52.950 --> 22:53.803
Doug, stop.

22:54.986 --> 22:57.355
Doug!

22:57.356 --> 22:59.943
Doug, stop. Please.

22:59.944 --> 23:00.776
I'm sorry-
- Yeah. I know.

23:00.777 --> 23:02.139
You're one sorry bitch!

23:02.140 --> 23:03.039
- Doug, listen to me.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.249
Listen to me, how can I fix this?

23:05.250 --> 23:06.082
Let me fix it.

23:06.083 --> 23:06.979
How?
- You can't!

23:06.980 --> 23:07.812
- Why not?

23:07.813 --> 23:09.949
- Because you sucked his fucking dick!

23:09.950 --> 23:11.929
And you're always in his face
like you want to do it again.

23:11.930 --> 23:14.230
I mean, you pretty much
said so inside, right?

23:16.460 --> 23:17.960
What is it with this guy, huh?

23:18.820 --> 23:20.359
I mean, was he hitting it that damn good,

23:20.360 --> 23:21.192
or was it the money?

23:21.193 --> 23:22.207
It was the money, right?

23:22.208 --> 23:23.463
- No.

23:24.526 --> 23:26.179
Doug, I'm over him, okay?

23:26.180 --> 23:29.220
I can be, just, let me.

23:29.221 --> 23:30.671
Let me fix it.

23:42.543 --> 23:43.375
How can you still have energy

23:43.376 --> 23:44.945
after an hour of this?

23:44.946 --> 23:46.966
Less talk, more jogging.

23:48.098 --> 23:51.056
So you and Stacy have been
friends since high school, right?

23:51.057 --> 23:52.422
Darren.

23:52.423 --> 23:53.529
- Yeah.
- Listen,

23:53.530 --> 23:54.362
I get it.

23:54.363 --> 23:57.509
I know you think I'm hot or beautiful,

23:57.510 --> 24:00.579
or whatever, and you
would love nothing more

24:00.580 --> 24:02.899
than to stick your little
twinkie in my Suzie cue.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.079
But, right now in this very second,

24:06.080 --> 24:08.859
I'm only interested in
getting in a good run.

24:08.860 --> 24:11.669
So, if you want to stay on my good side,

24:11.670 --> 24:14.879
just shut what I like to call the fuck up

24:14.880 --> 24:17.939
and watch my ass shake like
you were doing back there.

24:17.940 --> 24:20.239
I liked you better when you were.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.407
Okay?

24:21.408 --> 24:23.099
- Yeah, I can do that.

24:23.100 --> 24:23.933
- Good.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.120
- How are you awake when you
drank so much last night?

24:45.309 --> 24:46.142
- I know

24:47.440 --> 24:48.633
I like to run.

24:50.370 --> 24:52.020
- Nobody's seen him this morning?

24:54.150 --> 24:55.459
- Who?

24:55.460 --> 24:57.634
- Randy. Nobody's seen him?

25:01.290 --> 25:02.122
- Maybe...

25:02.123 --> 25:04.159
I mean the last time I remember seeing him

25:04.160 --> 25:06.204
was last night on the porch.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.037
- Mm-hmm?

25:07.038 --> 25:09.388
- Last time after that though,
I saw him out by that...

25:09.389 --> 25:10.459
The jacuzzi.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.173
- Damn, what was he doing?

25:18.776 --> 25:20.012
Well?

25:20.013 --> 25:23.233
- You know, he was videotaping
some stuff, you know?

25:23.234 --> 25:24.549
Mm-hmm?

25:24.550 --> 25:27.030
Punch wanking on Vivian and back?

25:32.313 --> 25:35.259
- But, still, nobody's
seen him after that though?

25:35.260 --> 25:36.327
Did you see him?

25:36.328 --> 25:37.160
- Mm-mm.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.330
- I thought he was up at
the creek or something.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.389
- Well, we would've seen him out

25:43.390 --> 25:46.236
while we were running
this morning if he did.

25:46.237 --> 25:47.909
No.

25:47.910 --> 25:48.743
No.

25:51.510 --> 25:52.899
- No, no. Okay?

25:52.900 --> 25:53.929
Don't say it.

25:53.930 --> 25:54.987
Don't say it.

25:56.562 --> 25:57.479
- Could be.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.279
- All right, it's just some bullshit story

26:01.280 --> 26:02.189
they tell tourists, okay?

26:02.190 --> 26:03.053
It's not real.

26:04.430 --> 26:07.002
- Axeman at Cutter's Creek.
- Jeez. It's not.

26:07.003 --> 26:08.643
It's not, all right?

26:09.147 --> 26:10.239
We'll just go out after breakfast,

26:10.240 --> 26:11.179
and we'll look for Randy, all right?

26:11.180 --> 26:13.250
He probably just jacked
himself into a comma.

26:14.084 --> 26:15.829
Well, I'd
like to be sure of that.

26:15.830 --> 26:17.288
- What, that he jacked
himself into a comma?

26:18.710 --> 26:19.879
That he's okay.

26:19.880 --> 26:20.713
I mean...

26:24.320 --> 26:26.239
- Oh, wait, you want to
go look for him right now?

26:26.240 --> 26:27.493
Yeah.

26:27.494 --> 26:29.479
- Oh God, he's like
literally the only person

26:29.480 --> 26:31.939
that can fuck up someone
when he's not even around.

26:31.940 --> 26:34.642
- All right, I'll go get Liz
and then we can just split up.

26:34.643 --> 26:36.269
Is that okay with everybody?

26:36.270 --> 26:37.102
- Mm-hmm.

26:37.103 --> 26:38.549
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

26:38.550 --> 26:39.670
Don't go alone guys.

27:43.967 --> 27:44.967
- Oh my God.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.643
Yeah, now he's not the
only one with some money.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.642
Yeah, motherfucking cheat.

28:30.477 --> 28:32.018
Randy?

28:32.019 --> 28:33.147
-  Randy?

28:43.270 --> 28:44.103
- You know what?

28:44.970 --> 28:46.879
I can't bother to look
that asshole anymore.

28:46.880 --> 28:47.899
He's not worth the time.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.200
We're going to waste our
whole day doing this.

28:53.540 --> 28:57.449
- Can't I change your mind?

28:57.450 --> 28:58.880
- No.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.937
But still like, show
me what you're working.

29:04.155 --> 29:05.278
- I'd bet you would.

30:09.173 --> 30:10.723
Liz, I'm coming with.

30:12.995 --> 30:15.182
- All right, then come on along I guess.

30:15.183 --> 30:16.442
- Nasty.

30:16.443 --> 30:17.276
I like it.

30:21.341 --> 30:22.326
- No.

30:22.327 --> 30:23.920
We already went that way.

30:23.921 --> 30:26.573
- Oh.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.331
- Let's go back this way.

30:28.332 --> 30:29.164
- Okay.

30:29.998 --> 30:30.830
What?

30:30.831 --> 30:31.663
- Oh fuck!

30:33.055 --> 30:34.849
You scared the shit out of me.

30:37.042 --> 30:38.749
- Where did you come from?

30:38.750 --> 30:40.556
- Just down creek.

30:41.390 --> 30:42.809
You saw Randy?

30:42.810 --> 30:44.149
- No.

30:44.150 --> 30:46.625
- Where do you think he went?

30:46.626 --> 30:47.459
- Mm-mm.

30:48.475 --> 30:50.149
All right, let's just
head back to the cabin

30:50.150 --> 30:52.065
and we'll just wait for
everybody back, all right?

30:52.066 --> 30:52.898
- All right.

30:52.899 --> 30:54.902
- Maybe they found him?

31:07.910 --> 31:09.429
- Seriously, Darren?

31:09.430 --> 31:10.399
- What?

31:10.400 --> 31:12.139
- You're just gonna eye-rate me?

31:12.140 --> 31:13.469
Not even gonna buy me dinner first?

31:13.470 --> 31:14.302
- I wasn't...

31:14.303 --> 31:15.421
There was no rate.

31:16.690 --> 31:17.579
- You're such a pussy.

31:17.580 --> 31:18.825
You know that?

31:18.826 --> 31:19.658
- I'm not a pussy.

31:19.659 --> 31:20.491
No?

31:20.492 --> 31:21.324
- No.

31:21.325 --> 31:22.999
- Then why won't you say something?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.379
You don't think I see you
and Randy sitting back,

31:25.380 --> 31:27.799
and whispering like two
little school girls?

31:27.800 --> 31:29.419
But your mouth is tighter
than Mother Teresa.

31:29.420 --> 31:30.520
That's not pussy-like?

31:35.820 --> 31:37.529
Come on Darren.

31:37.530 --> 31:39.280
Use your big words, you can say it.

31:42.712 --> 31:46.139
- I'm 30 years old and I can't
even get ready to say this.

31:46.140 --> 31:47.190
You're my dream girl.

31:49.730 --> 31:51.119
- What?

31:51.120 --> 31:52.359
- Look, I don't know what you see

31:52.360 --> 31:53.760
when you look in the mirror,

31:54.710 --> 31:56.760
but what everybody else sees, what I see,

31:58.500 --> 32:01.499
is damn near perfection.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.849
You're what every man dreams about,

32:03.850 --> 32:06.209
this beautiful fucking goddess.

32:06.210 --> 32:08.410
And here you are standing
right in front of me

32:09.379 --> 32:10.579
and I just don't know what to do about it.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.579
- Bullshit.

32:11.580 --> 32:12.413
- No.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.143
I'm being 100% transparent.

32:22.030 --> 32:24.509
- Pretty big words for a little pussy.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.139
- So what, I told you it was for my mom,

32:26.140 --> 32:27.349
why are you still calling me a pussy?

32:27.350 --> 32:29.590
- Because you're still acting like one.

32:41.760 --> 32:42.593
Time's up.

32:43.790 --> 32:45.840
Come see me when your balls finally drop.

33:00.010 --> 33:02.163
Guys, it's
just Randy being Randy.

33:03.141 --> 33:05.091
I mean, he does this shit all the time.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.369
I don't know about that.

33:07.370 --> 33:08.709
I mean, you guys stopped
hanging out with him

33:08.710 --> 33:09.779
a long time ago.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.629
I've been with this kid
for the past five years,

33:11.630 --> 33:13.339
and this is not like him

33:13.340 --> 33:16.199
to disappear at night, stay gone all day?

33:16.200 --> 33:18.843
I mean, does that really
sound like the Randy you know?

33:27.410 --> 33:30.592
- I mean, there was that one
time during the Mardi Gras,

33:30.593 --> 33:32.258
- Oh yeah.
- You know what I mean?

33:32.259 --> 33:34.629
He was gone for what, almost 36 hours?

33:34.630 --> 33:36.489
Couldn't find him for shit,

33:36.490 --> 33:37.449
and then next thing you know,

33:37.450 --> 33:38.809
he stumbles in drunk as shit

33:38.810 --> 33:40.539
with two videos worth of tits and ass.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.373
I mean...

33:42.682 --> 33:45.249
He called it what, 'Randy's
Tentacular Nipple Fest'?

33:49.018 --> 33:50.939
- Yeah, but...

33:50.940 --> 33:53.427
All the tits and ass are in this room.

33:59.730 --> 34:02.599
- Maybe we should call
the sheriff's office.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.729
- Guys, come on, he's fine.

34:04.730 --> 34:06.779
I mean, let's not get carried away, right?

34:06.780 --> 34:09.549
Besides, I mean, there hasn't been a phone

34:09.550 --> 34:10.769
installed in this cabin yet,

34:10.770 --> 34:12.499
and I haven't had a signal
since we made it over

34:12.500 --> 34:13.332
into this ridge.

34:13.333 --> 34:14.890
Yeah, me neither.

34:14.891 --> 34:16.021
- This is the Axeman of Cutter's Creek.

34:16.022 --> 34:18.111
God, stop it.

34:18.112 --> 34:19.716
- Yeah, it's just not cool.

34:19.717 --> 34:20.549
You just pussy

34:20.550 --> 34:22.068
'cause the black guy
gets it first.

34:22.069 --> 34:24.986
- And that shit ain't funny either.

34:25.970 --> 34:26.803
- Where's Doug?

34:27.680 --> 34:28.853
Has anyone seen Doug?

34:29.840 --> 34:31.049
- That's it. All right?

34:31.050 --> 34:32.949
You know, there's no Randy,

34:32.950 --> 34:34.239
there's no Doug, okay?

34:34.240 --> 34:35.209
They probably just hooked up,

34:35.210 --> 34:37.529
and they're chilling somewhere.

34:37.530 --> 34:38.609
- Doug and Randy?

34:38.610 --> 34:39.669
- Yes. Okay?

34:39.670 --> 34:40.503
They're fine.

34:42.731 --> 34:44.209
- You sure about that?

34:44.210 --> 34:45.043
- Yes.

34:46.260 --> 34:51.023
I mean, I bet my life on it.

35:03.496 --> 35:05.177
Come on.

35:05.178 --> 35:06.010
- Oh my God.

35:06.011 --> 35:07.753
- Oh God, oh my God-

35:07.754 --> 35:09.717
- You're spilling half of it.

35:11.958 --> 35:12.790
- I can't take this.

35:12.791 --> 35:14.059
- Where are you going?

35:14.060 --> 35:14.989
- I'm gonna go find Doug.

35:14.990 --> 35:16.129
No more.

35:16.130 --> 35:17.489
- Cass, it's dark out.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.322
- You know what?

35:18.323 --> 35:20.113
He would do the same thing for me, Stacy.

35:21.732 --> 35:23.629
- Just sit down, okay?

35:23.630 --> 35:25.389
If they're out there
together, they're fine.

35:25.390 --> 35:26.929
And if not, what are you going to do?

35:26.930 --> 35:28.399
- I don't know.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.589
Maybe try and help them.

35:30.590 --> 35:31.422
But I have to do something

35:31.423 --> 35:33.509
and anything is better than
what I'm doing right now,

35:33.510 --> 35:34.393
which is nothing.

35:37.590 --> 35:39.719
- She shouldn't be going
out there by herself.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.120
- Why don't you go with her?

35:42.510 --> 35:43.659
- Man, screw that shit.

35:43.660 --> 35:45.299
If there is some psycho axeman out there,

35:45.300 --> 35:47.447
he ain't getting my black ass.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.337
- Grow some balls, man.

36:05.232 --> 36:07.452
- Where's Cassidy?

36:13.240 --> 36:14.073
Cassidy!

36:18.384 --> 36:19.433
Cass!

36:25.321 --> 36:26.729
You let her go out there by herself?

36:26.730 --> 36:28.681
- I tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen.

36:28.682 --> 36:30.219
There was nothing I could do.

36:33.267 --> 36:34.100
- And you?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.730
- Hey, my name is Paul,
and that's between y'all.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.990
- What are you looking at, pussy?

37:06.470 --> 37:07.303
First catch up.

37:24.156 --> 37:25.823
- You are so wasted.

37:27.312 --> 37:31.021
God, I know.

37:31.022 --> 37:33.472
Shit man, oh my God.

37:49.562 --> 37:50.562
- Oh my God.

37:57.332 --> 37:58.164
Mm-mm.

37:58.165 --> 37:58.998
- What?

38:03.248 --> 38:04.081
- Nothing.

38:07.687 --> 38:11.520
I'm just gonna get us
on the same page is all.

38:34.621 --> 38:35.999
- Oh...

38:36.000 --> 38:38.538
You got a bar o'clock?

38:38.539 --> 38:39.622
- Mm-mm.
- No?

38:40.549 --> 38:41.738
- Not at all, no.

38:41.739 --> 38:43.313
I don't know, I'm a G.

38:43.314 --> 38:45.257
You know what, I'm triple OG.

38:45.258 --> 38:46.090
- Uh-huh?

38:46.091 --> 38:48.087
- I used to be a gangster
before I bought some glasses.

38:49.241 --> 38:50.787
- What?

38:50.788 --> 38:52.633
- I just need some fresh
air. I'm gonna go...

38:53.467 --> 38:58.134
to get some fresh air.

39:00.090 --> 39:00.922
- Oh, hold on.

39:00.923 --> 39:02.403
I'm gonna come too.

39:02.404 --> 39:03.952
I'm coming too.

39:03.953 --> 39:04.786
Coming.

39:18.853 --> 39:20.101
- Where are you two headed?

39:20.102 --> 39:21.219
- To get a breath...

39:21.220 --> 39:23.071
A breast of fresh ass.

39:25.812 --> 39:26.970
- Aye!

39:26.971 --> 39:27.803
- What?

39:27.804 --> 39:29.189
- Don't laugh at her.

39:29.190 --> 39:32.201
She's beautiful and
that's all she gotta be.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.366
Don't pass no judgment.

39:34.367 --> 39:36.974
- Breath of fresh air.

39:36.975 --> 39:37.807
Find Cassidy

39:37.808 --> 39:38.729
and bring her back.

39:38.730 --> 39:40.353
I'll do that while I'm gone

39:40.354 --> 39:42.402
and you find Deezer.

39:42.403 --> 39:43.235
- What?

39:43.236 --> 39:44.564
Deezer..

39:48.550 --> 39:51.277
- You look like you could
use a good licking...

39:57.513 --> 39:58.346
Come on.

40:31.427 --> 40:32.260
- What?

40:33.892 --> 40:34.725
- Nothing.

40:37.687 --> 40:38.829
- Tell me.

40:38.830 --> 40:40.159
- Well, it's like...

40:40.160 --> 40:43.593
Seems like everybody here
is getting laid, but me.

40:47.900 --> 40:50.827
- Liz and Tammy just went back there.

40:51.740 --> 40:54.440
- Yeah, well, there's more
rooms in this place, right?

40:56.945 --> 40:58.528
- I don't know.

40:58.529 --> 40:59.361
I mean, somebody has to be back here

40:59.362 --> 41:00.663
for when Cass comes back.

41:03.590 --> 41:06.199
- Okay, look, there's two
things you need to know.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.099
Okay?

41:07.100 --> 41:08.759
First one,

41:08.760 --> 41:11.489
is that I'm going to
go back into our room,

41:11.490 --> 41:12.690
and I'm gonna get naked.

41:14.481 --> 41:15.529
Yeah.

41:15.530 --> 41:17.599
The second one, now this is a good one.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.053
Better pay attention, okay?

41:20.000 --> 41:21.359
I'm gonna have an orgasm.

41:21.360 --> 41:25.339
Now, I would really like
it for you to be there

41:25.340 --> 41:27.329
for these two things.

41:27.330 --> 41:29.569
But if you're not going to be there,

41:29.570 --> 41:32.343
I'm sure there's someone else
that would die to be there.

41:38.531 --> 41:39.713
- All right.

41:50.836 --> 41:52.449
-  Man,

41:52.450 --> 41:54.579
this is the best night of my life.

41:54.580 --> 41:55.413
- How so?

41:58.570 --> 42:00.649
I got a free bottle of liquor,

42:00.650 --> 42:02.299
full moon,

42:02.300 --> 42:04.519
what more can I ask for, except you know,

42:04.520 --> 42:06.989
not to vomit anytime soon?

42:06.990 --> 42:08.479
- Hmm, lightweight.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.399
- Lightweight?

42:09.400 --> 42:11.489
I finished that other
bottle and started this one.

42:11.490 --> 42:13.649
You took two sips and you got drunk.

42:13.650 --> 42:14.916
You got a level like a Tic Tac.

42:30.973 --> 42:33.079
- You are so sexy.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.109
- I know.

42:37.590 --> 42:38.890
- What are you waiting on?

42:40.110 --> 42:41.443
Get in my belly.

43:09.990 --> 43:10.823
- Don't be.

43:12.510 --> 43:14.127
You had me at hello.

43:26.310 --> 43:27.143
You okay?

43:36.300 --> 43:37.133
- Yeah.

43:43.290 --> 43:44.438
Ready?

43:44.439 --> 43:45.896
- Yeah.

44:02.870 --> 44:04.332
- You thirsty?

44:05.166 --> 44:06.749
- Yeah.

44:06.750 --> 44:07.600
- You want water?

44:08.550 --> 44:09.383
- Make it twice.

44:10.392 --> 44:12.908
- Okay baby.

44:19.750 --> 44:21.003
- Miss you already.

44:22.855 --> 44:24.188
- Miss you more.

45:25.040 --> 45:25.873
Ugh.

45:27.498 --> 45:28.330
What is that, vinegar?

45:41.880 --> 45:42.763
Randy?

45:46.710 --> 45:48.109
Randy, I swear to God,

45:48.110 --> 45:50.597
if you jump out at me,
I'm gonna so pissed.

46:06.358 --> 46:07.775
What in the hell?

46:33.380 --> 46:34.213
Doug?

46:35.870 --> 46:36.703
Cassidy?

46:37.720 --> 46:38.883
Are you guys in here?

46:40.300 --> 46:41.739
I thought I saw blood on the door knob,

46:41.740 --> 46:44.759
I just want to make sure
you guys were all right.

46:54.895 --> 46:55.843
- What was that?

46:55.844 --> 46:56.683
What was that?

46:56.684 --> 46:57.769
- What?

46:57.770 --> 46:59.038
What?

46:59.039 --> 46:59.896
Did you cum?

46:59.897 --> 47:00.896
- No.

47:00.897 --> 47:02.354
I heard something.

47:06.827 --> 47:07.906
- Fuck bitch!

47:11.717 --> 47:12.549
- No.

47:12.550 --> 47:13.382
- Yeah.
- No. Stop.

47:13.383 --> 47:15.574
- I heard something.

47:15.575 --> 47:16.407
- It's fine.

47:16.408 --> 47:17.393
- No, it's not.

47:17.394 --> 47:18.428
- Oh, come on.

47:21.228 --> 47:22.841
Where are you going?

47:22.842 --> 47:24.863
- To check it out.

47:24.864 --> 47:26.614
- Wait, I'm gonna go.

47:31.968 --> 47:33.810
Stay here.

47:33.811 --> 47:34.643
- You sure?

47:34.644 --> 47:36.394
- Yeah, it's nothing.

47:56.977 --> 47:58.975
What is it?

47:58.976 --> 47:59.808
- Come here.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.810
She's getting killed in there.

48:13.811 --> 48:15.776
You have no idea.

48:21.849 --> 48:22.950
Oh my God.

48:22.951 --> 48:23.839
What?

48:23.840 --> 48:26.922
- That made me want a mouth
full of vagina.

48:26.923 --> 48:28.922
They're okay?

48:28.923 --> 48:29.924
-  You, Tammy and Liz

48:29.925 --> 48:31.544
were like lesbians?

48:31.545 --> 48:32.377
- Thinking about it.

48:32.378 --> 48:33.210
- Yeah?

48:33.211 --> 48:34.043
- No, seriously, man.

48:34.044 --> 48:35.963
You should've heard her scream.

48:40.240 --> 48:41.072
- Yeah?

48:41.073 --> 48:42.032
- Yeah.

48:42.033 --> 48:42.865
- Enough for another round?

48:42.866 --> 48:44.380
- You bet your ass, baby.

49:31.479 --> 49:32.686
Sheriff,

49:34.797 --> 49:36.919
- I'm over at the old Talbert house.

49:38.831 --> 49:40.769
Charlie Wayne
Wright got his tally wacker

49:40.770 --> 49:43.529
caught in the motel snap
machine again.

49:43.530 --> 49:46.230
- What is it with that damn
kid and putting his pecker?

49:46.231 --> 49:47.064
Ugh.

49:49.990 --> 49:51.769
Tell Lester I'm on the way.

49:51.770 --> 49:53.829
Have him pick up some motor oil,

49:53.830 --> 49:55.493
and some petroleum jelly.

50:37.969 --> 50:38.802
- Ugh.

50:39.789 --> 50:40.622
God.

50:54.839 --> 50:57.756
Oh my God.

51:02.228 --> 51:03.060
Oh my God!

51:35.972 --> 51:37.139
- Here you go.

51:57.137 --> 51:57.969
Why?

51:57.970 --> 51:59.303
- W-what's that?

52:04.722 --> 52:06.141
- What?

52:24.085 --> 52:25.285
What the fuck is it now?

52:34.194 --> 52:37.298
- Please.

52:37.299 --> 52:39.530
- I can't get you down.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.358
I can't, you can do it baby.

52:43.656 --> 52:46.987
You can do it.

52:48.750 --> 52:50.333
Sheriff?

52:52.610 --> 52:54.853
- Damn boy, you're one big some bitch.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.493
What's your name, son?

52:59.200 --> 53:00.559
Bill.

53:00.560 --> 53:03.003
- Bill, you got any identification?

53:04.430 --> 53:05.263
- Yeah.

53:06.580 --> 53:07.580
- Then let's see it.

53:17.020 --> 53:19.019
Just saw the lights on,
thought I'd stop by,

53:19.020 --> 53:19.973
see what's what.

53:20.860 --> 53:23.099
Not too often we get anybody
willing to spend the night

53:23.100 --> 53:24.199
in this old house,

53:24.200 --> 53:26.450
with the town legend
being what it is at all.

53:34.365 --> 53:35.448
- You got it.

53:39.417 --> 53:41.033
- You got company inside?

53:43.970 --> 53:45.359
- Yes.

53:45.360 --> 53:46.593
- How'd you get up here?

53:50.030 --> 53:50.893
- My truck.

53:52.190 --> 53:53.023
- Where is it?

53:55.345 --> 53:56.963
- Hmm, it's out there somewhere.

53:58.140 --> 53:59.240
I have family in town.

54:01.965 --> 54:03.919
- There's a goddamn Mercedes-Benz

54:03.920 --> 54:05.179
parked few miles down the road

54:05.180 --> 54:06.853
outside of Maddie Baker's place.

54:07.810 --> 54:09.560
That belong to one of your kinfolk?

54:11.495 --> 54:12.959
- Yes.

54:12.960 --> 54:13.903
Yes, it does.

54:15.510 --> 54:19.339
- Damn shame to leave such a
nice car by the road like that.

54:19.340 --> 54:21.240
What were they doing out there anyway?

54:24.275 --> 54:25.107
- Babe, come on.

54:25.108 --> 54:25.940
You can do it.

54:27.756 --> 54:29.755
Go Tammy.

54:29.756 --> 54:32.166
- Look, I'm not going without you, okay?

54:32.167 --> 54:32.999
All right?

54:33.000 --> 54:35.301
It's either we both go,

54:35.302 --> 54:36.260
or...

54:37.325 --> 54:38.157
- No, just go.

54:38.158 --> 54:38.990
No.

54:38.991 --> 54:40.367
No!
- Just go.

54:40.368 --> 54:41.505
- No. Come on.

54:41.506 --> 54:42.624
Come on.

54:42.625 --> 54:46.549
Come on.

54:46.550 --> 54:48.943
- What's with all the questions, Sheriff?

54:48.944 --> 54:51.779
Something happen out there?

54:51.780 --> 54:53.949
- Let's get one thing
crystal motherfucking clear,

54:53.950 --> 54:54.863
shit hill.

54:55.890 --> 54:57.979
I ask the questions around here.

54:57.980 --> 55:01.109
I want you to ask questions,
I'll shove my fist up your ass,

55:01.110 --> 55:03.133
and work your mouth like sock puppet!

55:28.376 --> 55:30.299
- Hey Viv.

55:30.300 --> 55:31.653
Hey Viv, wake up.

55:33.966 --> 55:35.991
Hey, it's time to head
back to the cabin, wake up.

55:36.825 --> 55:37.941
Ah, shit!

55:37.942 --> 55:40.409
- Oh, sorry. Reflex.

55:40.410 --> 55:42.110
- The hell kind of reflex is that?

55:43.295 --> 55:44.799
- What's the matter, did you get hurt?

55:44.800 --> 55:45.809
- You hit me in the ear.

55:45.810 --> 55:49.468
- Hurt by little bitch
slap bitch?

55:50.979 --> 55:52.229
Hmm, excuse me.

56:02.019 --> 56:04.438
- We're going, okay?

56:05.948 --> 56:07.777
I can't.
- Shh, it's okay.

56:07.778 --> 56:08.610
It's okay.

56:08.611 --> 56:11.861
It's okay.

56:14.127 --> 56:14.960
- I can't.

56:16.960 --> 56:19.007
- Shh...

56:19.008 --> 56:19.883
Come on.

56:19.884 --> 56:22.634
Shh.

56:29.809 --> 56:31.424
You gotta be quiet, okay?

56:31.425 --> 56:35.070
Shh, quiet. Shh.

56:35.071 --> 56:35.996
You're okay.

56:35.997 --> 56:37.551
That's right, we're almost there.

56:39.331 --> 56:40.241
I know. I know.

56:40.242 --> 56:42.060
Just try to be quiet, okay?

56:42.061 --> 56:43.360
Just try to. Come on.

56:43.361 --> 56:46.345
Come on.

56:46.346 --> 56:47.657
All right. All right.

56:47.658 --> 56:49.669
All right baby. All right.

56:49.670 --> 56:51.310
All right, I got you.

56:52.828 --> 56:55.290
Shh, just be quiet baby, okay?

56:55.291 --> 57:00.291
Shh.

57:09.142 --> 57:10.076
Please stay with me.

57:10.077 --> 57:11.653
Stay with me baby.

57:13.390 --> 57:14.783
- I wanna go.

57:14.784 --> 57:15.616
- No.

57:15.617 --> 57:17.577
No, you're not going, okay?

57:17.578 --> 57:19.122
Okay? Shh.

57:19.123 --> 57:21.397
Say you're not going, okay?

57:21.398 --> 57:25.648
- I'm sorry.

58:00.920 --> 58:03.469
Fuck.

58:03.470 --> 58:07.180
Oh my God.

58:29.950 --> 58:31.367
That was awesome.

58:32.540 --> 58:37.340
That was so good baby.

58:42.442 --> 58:43.275
What?

58:47.020 --> 58:47.853
- Nothing.

58:50.230 --> 58:51.063
- Tell me.

58:54.561 --> 58:55.643
- All right, you're
amazing.

58:55.644 --> 58:56.894
You're amazing.

59:01.244 --> 59:02.661
- You really are.

59:04.030 --> 59:07.197
Damn, can't imagine being without you.

59:09.470 --> 59:12.047
Best thing that ever happened to me.

59:13.125 --> 59:15.575
- You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

59:17.104 --> 59:18.437
- Am I?

59:18.438 --> 59:19.271
- Mm-hmm

59:23.427 --> 59:24.344
- Love you.

59:28.399 --> 59:29.816
- I love you too.

59:35.964 --> 59:38.881
- Would you prefer that every time?

59:40.209 --> 59:41.041
Well, I don't know,

59:41.042 --> 59:42.625
'cause I can't get high off of Nick.

59:43.811 --> 59:44.952
- I'm being serious.

59:44.953 --> 59:46.759
I'm being serious.

59:46.760 --> 59:47.593
- Stupid.

59:48.800 --> 59:50.723
Well, why are you asking me that?

1:00:05.223 --> 1:00:06.492
What?

1:00:06.493 --> 1:00:08.579
Was that what that was about outside?

1:00:08.580 --> 1:00:09.662
Are you broke or something?

1:00:09.663 --> 1:00:10.850
I mean, did...

1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:13.320
Did you get the inheritance?

1:00:14.850 --> 1:00:15.750
- Would it matter?

1:00:17.260 --> 1:00:20.169
- No, I don't care.

1:00:20.170 --> 1:00:22.520
I love you, it's not
about the money, whatever.

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:27.929
Okay.

1:00:27.930 --> 1:00:29.969
Good.

1:00:29.970 --> 1:00:30.803
Good.

1:00:33.530 --> 1:00:36.159
- Well, I'm going to go take a shower.

1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:38.083
Do you
want to come with me?

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:48.832
- Okay.

1:00:48.833 --> 1:00:52.593
Well don't let that be your
excuse for smelling like shit.

1:01:29.396 --> 1:01:30.426
- Oh man.

1:01:32.830 --> 1:01:36.522
Hey, why is the door locked?

1:01:36.523 --> 1:01:37.399
Move.

1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:40.948
- Oh what, it's gonna open
up for you?

1:01:54.264 --> 1:01:55.097
- Brian?

1:01:59.468 --> 1:02:01.515
What kind of shit is this?

1:02:11.498 --> 1:02:13.449
Can you pick a lock?

1:02:13.450 --> 1:02:16.367
- Do I look like I can pick a lock?

1:02:17.740 --> 1:02:18.573
- Kinda.

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:21.754
- Why? 'Cause I'm black?

1:02:24.570 --> 1:02:26.713
'Cause you're a guy, you sensitive bitch.

1:02:27.810 --> 1:02:29.623
- Oh, well no.

1:02:31.300 --> 1:02:32.550
But I know what I can do.

1:02:33.650 --> 1:02:35.970
I can go around this bitch and
see if the back door's open.

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:39.135
Watch this shit.

1:02:39.136 --> 1:02:40.708
I'll be right back.

1:02:51.426 --> 1:02:53.089
Hey baby, you sure
you don't wanna come in here?

1:02:53.090 --> 1:02:55.809
The water's nice and warm.

1:02:55.810 --> 1:02:57.069
- Yeah, and so is your vagina.

1:02:57.070 --> 1:02:59.109
I'll come in that when you get back.

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.039
- You're a little bit nasty.

1:03:09.970 --> 1:03:12.220
It sure is quiet out there.

1:03:13.300 --> 1:03:14.479
- Huh?

1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:16.439
I said it
sure is quiet out there,

1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:18.108
I wonder what they're up to.

1:03:23.030 --> 1:03:24.203
- It is pretty quiet.

1:03:29.439 --> 1:03:31.769
I'm gonna go run and check on some stuff

1:03:31.770 --> 1:03:34.983
and I'll make sure Cassidy made
it back with Doug and Randy.

1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:41.813
Hey babe?

1:03:43.050 --> 1:03:43.882
- Yeah?

1:03:43.883 --> 1:03:46.535
- I'm just going to go run
and check on some stuff.

1:03:46.536 --> 1:03:50.000
- Okay.

1:03:50.001 --> 1:03:51.029
- I'll be right back.

1:03:51.030 --> 1:03:52.329
- Come on, don't say that.

1:03:52.330 --> 1:03:54.159
That's what they say
in all of horror movies

1:03:56.050 --> 1:03:57.889
- What do you want me to say?
- Say...

1:03:57.890 --> 1:03:59.749
I love you honey.

1:03:59.750 --> 1:04:01.000
I'll see you in a minute.

1:04:02.050 --> 1:04:04.460
- Okay.

1:04:04.461 --> 1:04:06.344
I love you honey, and
I'll see you in a minute.

1:04:06.345 --> 1:04:07.177
- There you go.

1:04:07.178 --> 1:04:08.383
- Yeah?
- Perfect.

1:04:14.019 --> 1:04:15.769
- I'll be right back.

1:04:25.426 --> 1:04:27.738
- Umph!

1:04:52.924 --> 1:04:53.757
- Hey Viv.

1:04:58.031 --> 1:04:58.864
Viv?

1:06:03.766 --> 1:06:05.516
Hey, who's that here?

1:06:07.613 --> 1:06:09.263
Hey, it was that you Randy?

1:06:10.710 --> 1:06:11.929
Hey man, you jump out on me,

1:06:11.930 --> 1:06:12.829
there's gonna be some furniture moving

1:06:12.830 --> 1:06:14.880
around this motherfucker, I swear to God.

1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:32.600
Hey man, quit playing.

1:06:47.767 --> 1:06:48.629
- Shh.

1:06:48.630 --> 1:06:50.544
- Hey man, didn't you hear me calling you?

1:06:50.545 --> 1:06:52.291
- You have to be quiet.

1:06:52.292 --> 1:06:53.969
- What the hell you mean, 'shh'?

1:06:53.970 --> 1:06:55.018
And where's everybody anyway?

1:06:55.019 --> 1:06:55.936
- Be quiet.

1:06:57.446 --> 1:06:58.363
He is here.

1:06:59.327 --> 1:07:00.977
- The fuck are you talking about?

1:07:02.279 --> 1:07:04.029
- The Axeman is here.

1:07:06.699 --> 1:07:07.532
- What?

1:07:16.569 --> 1:07:18.358
Hey.

1:07:18.359 --> 1:07:19.192
Wake up.

1:07:20.999 --> 1:07:22.168
Wake up...

1:07:33.661 --> 1:07:38.002
What was that?

1:07:38.003 --> 1:07:41.241
- That was Vivian.

1:07:41.242 --> 1:07:43.787
- You have to come in
here and close the door.

1:07:46.333 --> 1:07:48.994
Oh fuck.

1:07:48.995 --> 1:07:50.155
Oh fuck.

1:08:03.219 --> 1:08:08.219
- After you.

1:08:39.947 --> 1:08:42.433
Where are you going?

1:08:42.434 --> 1:08:44.299
- Look, I'm just gonna
go see if she's okay.

1:08:44.300 --> 1:08:45.529
All right?

1:08:45.530 --> 1:08:48.178
- What, are you fucking nuts?

1:08:48.179 --> 1:08:49.569
He's out there.

1:08:49.570 --> 1:08:52.299
- Look, she could be hurt.

1:08:52.300 --> 1:08:54.849
- She's fucking dead, Darren.

1:08:54.850 --> 1:08:56.923
You didn't see what he did to Brian.

1:08:58.059 --> 1:09:00.897
Oh God, you didn't see.

1:09:00.898 --> 1:09:01.730
- Go ahead.

1:09:01.731 --> 1:09:04.497
Just close the door Stace, all right?

1:09:06.770 --> 1:09:08.299
- Close the fucking door.

1:09:08.300 --> 1:09:11.179
I'll be right back.

1:09:11.180 --> 1:09:12.230
- Don't go out there.

1:09:13.136 --> 1:09:13.969
Darren?

1:09:15.380 --> 1:09:20.380
- Oh God, listen.

1:09:44.358 --> 1:09:45.941
- You motherfucker!

1:09:47.199 --> 1:09:50.054
Where are you, you motherfucker?

1:09:50.055 --> 1:09:52.388
Come get some, motherfucker!

1:10:04.469 --> 1:10:05.302
Come on!

1:10:16.870 --> 1:10:18.953
- Get some, motherfucker.

1:12:27.126 --> 1:12:28.709
- Just fucking die!

1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:04.918
- Okay bitch.

1:13:15.278 --> 1:13:18.879
Motherfucker!

1:13:42.950 --> 1:13:44.259
- Run, bitch!

1:13:44.260 --> 1:13:45.429
Run!

1:13:45.430 --> 1:13:47.819
You're only gonna die

1:13:47.820 --> 1:13:48.704
tired!

1:14:39.254 --> 1:14:44.254
on the devil's dime

1:14:47.834 --> 1:14:52.834
on the green light

1:15:27.933 --> 1:15:32.933
for the gold blue skies

1:15:36.043 --> 1:15:41.043
on her mounted lines
