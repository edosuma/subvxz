00:08.091 --> 00:09.426
<i>Previously on You Me Her...</i>

00:09.509 --> 00:11.928
What the fuck?

00:12.053 --> 00:14.347
Oh, this day has
really taken a turn.

00:14.472 --> 00:16.474
Whether it was the two of us,
the three of us,

00:16.558 --> 00:17.892
this never should have happened.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.395
If you walk out that door,
don't call, don't text.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.896
You are dead to me.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.065
<i>You saw your dad?</i>

00:24.149 --> 00:25.859
I'm walking you to school.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.236
<i>But you're still</i>
<i>getting divorced Monday</i>

00:28.361 --> 00:29.487
<i>and driving back to Seattle?</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:31.781
I start a business
and ask for some support,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.366
and suddenly
you're working on a Saturday,

00:33.450 --> 00:35.410
you come home
after the girls are fed and in bed?

00:35.535 --> 00:37.120
You seriously think
I stayed at work late

00:37.203 --> 00:39.122
on a Saturday
to piss you off? And you haven't even started
community placement.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.169
We help them with résumés,
job applications, that kind of thing.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.837
<i>What do I do in the meantime?</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:47.881
<i>Hang out. Get to know them.</i>

00:47.964 --> 00:50.383
-Oh, oh, oh, oh!
-Dudes, they get crazy anxious

00:50.467 --> 00:52.385
when they're sitting across
from a beautiful woman.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.180
-I'm always anxious around you.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.515
<i>Izzy. From the moment</i>
<i>I opened that hotel room door--</i>

00:57.599 --> 00:58.850
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

00:58.975 --> 01:01.186
Are you about to
propose to me right now?

01:01.269 --> 01:02.228
<i>What? No.</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:04.397
Well, congratulations.
You're pregnant.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.149
You have got to be
fucking kidding me.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.696
Emma?

01:12.405 --> 01:14.199
Hey, uh, are you okay

01:17.911 --> 01:20.080
You need to take a deep breath.

01:20.663 --> 01:25.084
Okay? You really need to just...
calm yourself. It's all good.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.110
Em.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.071
Emma.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.864
Emma!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.282
-Oh, um...

01:56.407 --> 01:58.743
-Hey, you.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.829
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.288
No. Things are, um...
They're good.

02:02.372 --> 02:06.584
They're...
They're really, really... super.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.962
They are, um...

02:09.546 --> 02:11.756
-They're super.
-Okay. Stop nodding.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.804
Maybe you're coming down
with a little something?

02:17.929 --> 02:20.223
That's one way to put it.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.368
Howdy.

02:40.785 --> 02:41.995
Howdy...

02:42.745 --> 02:43.830
Wow.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.541
So, what was it last night?

02:46.624 --> 02:48.793
Why do you always want to know
about my weird dreams?

02:48.877 --> 02:49.919
I'm the therapist.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.462
They always crack me up.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.799
-I decided it meant you're a genius.
-Well, it does.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.720
Okay, well, I was drifting down

02:58.803 --> 03:01.222
this big, slow river
on a pizza-shaped floatie,

03:01.306 --> 03:03.308
and I passed Jack
sitting on the riverbed

03:03.391 --> 03:05.018
with his feet in the water,

03:05.602 --> 03:09.647
and there was a real-life tiger
just calmly resting beside him.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.233
Oh, and the tiger was wearing my clothes.
I don't know.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.446
Oh, man, the way
your mind works, Peanut.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.614
Don't.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.699
Sorry.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.413
How long are you gonna keep
showing up like this?

03:26.623 --> 03:29.626
Until you forgive me
or my project ends,

03:30.335 --> 03:31.878
whichever comes first.

03:32.587 --> 03:33.546
And then what?

03:33.630 --> 03:36.466
You're just gonna disappear again
like a drunk ghost in the night?

03:37.425 --> 03:39.052
"Drunk ghost in the night."

03:39.802 --> 03:42.138
Oh, right. I'm funny when
I'm trying to be mean;

03:42.222 --> 03:43.973
so fucking annoying.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.850
I'm not gonna ghost on you.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.854
What
Kids say that.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.232
Yes, but you definitely shouldn't.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.579
Hello?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.253
Do you have an appointment?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.882
You can just come in.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.263
I'm very troubled, Doctor.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.348
Oh, no.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.933
Oh, yes.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.519
Well, um, okay.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.937
Could you
be more specific;

04:31.062 --> 04:35.525
maybe using a breathier voice
with crazier eyes,

04:35.650 --> 04:37.193
like Winona Ryder eyes?

04:39.195 --> 04:40.697
I can see it.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.492
I'm very into the idea
of getting caught.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.494
Is that bad?

04:46.869 --> 04:49.706
Am <i>I</i> bad?

04:49.789 --> 04:51.499
It's chronic exhibitionism,

04:51.624 --> 04:55.044
level three paraphilia;
serious stuff.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.713
Say that again.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.717
Level. Three.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.844
Paraphilia.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.514
You know what I like.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.183
<i>♪ So touch me ♪</i>

05:09.267 --> 05:10.184
<i>♪ Touch me ♪</i>

05:10.268 --> 05:11.728
<i>♪ Touch me ♪</i>

05:12.520 --> 05:15.106
<i>♪ And touch me again ♪</i>

05:15.231 --> 05:17.191
<i>♪ Yeah, touch me ♪</i>

05:17.275 --> 05:18.192
<i>♪ Touch me ♪</i>

05:18.276 --> 05:19.527
<i>♪ Touch me... ♪</i>

05:21.529 --> 05:23.865
You know, I didn't
actually come here to office-fuck you.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.867
-I know. I was just saying, "Hey."

05:25.950 --> 05:27.744
I'm on my way to Directions.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.246
You know what they say...

05:30.330 --> 05:32.874
"Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans."

05:32.957 --> 05:35.710
Please stop quoting
motivational posters.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.962
-It's an occupational hazard.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.176
I, um... this, um...

05:44.135 --> 05:45.219
-Wow.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.472
Your erection
is very distracting.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.640
Oh. Imagine how it is
from this end.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.605
-These are cute.
-Mm-hmm.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.484
You know what would look really good
on this tiny finger right there?

05:59.567 --> 06:01.277
Jack, stop.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.987
I know.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.698
You literally got divorced
a month and a half ago,

06:05.782 --> 06:07.700
and you know that
I need to focus on, like,

06:07.784 --> 06:09.744
getting my life-shit sorted.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.746
Mm. How will I know?

06:12.371 --> 06:15.374
-Um, but I have an idea.
-Okay.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.796
Why don't I propose to you
when you least expect it?

06:20.755 --> 06:25.009
Okay, but you're gonna have
to ask Gabe for permission first.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.136
-Okay.
-We're a highly traditional family.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.471
-Mm.
-Yeah.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.140
My insider tip
would be to offer him goats.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.810
-Seems reasonable.
-That should get it done.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.524
Look, I have to go.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.733
-No.
-I know.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.529
I have to save more
hard

06:46.280 --> 06:47.740
I'm kidding.
I'm not saving anybody.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.283
I'm just getting free manicures.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.077
Mm. I love you.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.411
I love you.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.634
8 ball, corner pocket.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.680
Goddamn it!

07:11.472 --> 07:12.515
Rematch.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.975
Uh, no.
It's Sasha's turn.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.603
-I'll humiliate you again later.
-Hey, don't get too cocky, White Guilt.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.441
-That's how all kingpins fall.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have a seat.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.568
Will you help me?

07:23.651 --> 07:27.321
Um, ah, racker is just
right under there.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.415
You want to break?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.208
No.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.585
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.545
Will you pass me that?

07:42.670 --> 07:43.671
Thank you.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.762
How'd you get so good?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.848
Uh, well...

07:53.973 --> 07:55.057
when I was a kid,

07:55.141 --> 07:57.602
my dad used to leave me
at a bar while he did...

07:57.685 --> 07:59.562
I don't know...
God knows what in the back.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.231
The bartender felt sorry for me,
so she taught me how to play.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.484
By the time I was 12,
I could beat her.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.694
Huh.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.696
Yeah, boohoo, right?

08:09.238 --> 08:11.657
The upside is I made
all my college beer money

08:11.741 --> 08:14.702
sharking arrogant frat boys,
so that was good.

08:16.913 --> 08:17.830
My dad...

08:18.706 --> 08:21.292
Heaven for him
would be Willy Wonka's factory

08:21.375 --> 08:23.127
but filled with all the drugs.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.673
Mom?

08:27.798 --> 08:29.133
Dead. Yours?

08:29.967 --> 08:32.762
Vodka and pills; mostly pills.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.388
Blows.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.349
Hmm, pretty sure dead mom
is worse.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.935
Oh, yeah.
Dead mom wins every time.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.445
I'm getting this sinking feeling
it's gonna be another five years

08:49.529 --> 08:51.531
before she's ready to have a kid.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.826
What'd you expect?
I mean, she's 27.

08:55.952 --> 08:59.872
Yeah, which j-just...
just happens to be

08:59.956 --> 09:01.791
the national average,
by the way.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.834
For women getting PhDs?

09:05.169 --> 09:07.547
Fair, but she was super into it
before Emma left.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.091
All caught up in the crazy.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.511
Do you think...
there's anything like

09:13.594 --> 09:17.181
those therapeutic pet cafés except with babies
instead of cats and dogs?

09:25.648 --> 09:28.985
I know, it's weird. I'm like that
super-weird baby dude.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.572
Until you impregnate someone,

09:32.655 --> 09:35.908
you can just keep bribing
your preternaturally wise nephew

09:35.992 --> 09:38.077
to do this father/son shit with you.

09:38.786 --> 09:41.372
Fine, but I'm gonna have
to start giving <i>you</i> some advice.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.582
Go ahead.

09:43.332 --> 09:47.128
You need some... some insider tips
on scoring a girlfriend?

09:47.628 --> 09:50.006
I've got three of those.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.593
Fuck.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.808
-Babe.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.395
We got to go soon, so you're gonna have
to wrap up the standing coma.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.440
Oh, yeah, cool.
A-Absolutely.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.693
Seriously, are you sick for real?

10:10.818 --> 10:12.153
Uh, I think, maybe.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.779
You know, I haven't been
sleeping well lately,

10:13.863 --> 10:17.033
and my... my left ear is clogged,
which is very disorienting.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.619
I also think I'm coming down
off the Halloran Building, you know,

10:19.702 --> 10:21.412
a little ah! Followed by some uh...

10:21.537 --> 10:23.122
That's a lot of stuff. It really is.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.834
But it's rally time.

10:27.335 --> 10:31.380
Jett and Kim are one of Seattle's
top five lesbian power couples,

10:31.464 --> 10:34.008
and if they like us,
we get matching broaches

10:34.133 --> 10:36.802
based on Georgia O'Keeffe's
<i>Black Iris</i>.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.929
So cool. Like a pride thing?

10:39.972 --> 10:41.390
No, babe, I'm just kidding.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.267
We're not really getting
matching vagina broaches.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.603
Yeah, I knew that.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.607
Maybe you should go get dressed.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.108
Yeah.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.572
I'll just clean this up.
Let me by.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.450
I'll just take care of everything here.
That's great.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.286
Leave this out here...
Banana on the coffee table.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.294
Did you feed this to Callie?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.046
Uh, yeah. I think so.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.590
This is Lily's food.
This is for an infant.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.008
She didn't seem to mind.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.594
Callie's a toddler.
She gets solid food.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.389
We left Dino Nuggets for her
in the fridge. She loves Dino Nuggets.

11:22.056 --> 11:25.309
Didn't strike me as nutritious.
I-I made a judgment call.

11:25.726 --> 11:26.977
Also, I ate them.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.188
Unbelievable.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.815
I promised her Dino Nuggets,

11:30.898 --> 11:33.776
and you fed her this whipped...
whatever the hell this is.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.903
-She must have been devastated.
-Dave.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.905
Yes?

11:38.447 --> 11:39.782
Sit down.
You need to see this.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.619
What, the <i>Fluppies</i>? I've seen, like,
a thousand hours of this shit.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.329
It's basically a hypnotic babysitter.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.124
Dude, they're so beautiful.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.460
The one that's cooing is empathy,
the orange one is joy,

11:51.585 --> 11:54.130
and the red one is unconditional love.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.215
They all live together in Fluppville,

11:56.632 --> 11:58.342
which is the human soul.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.261
With every adventure,

12:00.344 --> 12:02.930
they're just figuring it
all out together, you know?

12:03.681 --> 12:06.892
And the maps they get from
the Dalmatian-professor thing...

12:06.976 --> 12:09.645
I mean, that's...
that's the journey of life.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.315
Maybe it's their Bible.
I'm not really sure yet.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.987
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.156
-Extremely.
-Later.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.161
Thank you, Gabriel.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.204
You want to know
what young Socrates did?

12:27.288 --> 12:30.207
He fed Lily's food to Callie
and ate the Dino Nuggets

12:30.291 --> 12:33.502
because he's so stoned, he thinks the
<i>Fluppies</i> have some deeper meaning.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.630
Oh, yeah, the, uh, human-soul thing.
Yeah, everybody knows that.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.341
Well, shit.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.927
I mean, he was clearly high.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.305
Oh, my God.
Did you call the police?

12:45.973 --> 12:49.185
Really, really funny stuff. He also left
a mess, by the way, which I'm cleaning up.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.896
He's a teenager we employ for two hours
while I'm right next door.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.857
-Lower the bar a little. Nobody died.
Super.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.526
Hey, why don't we just let the kids
hang out by themselves, huh,

12:57.610 --> 13:00.738
put out some knives and aerosol cans,
see what happens?

13:02.615 --> 13:03.657
David.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.327
I don't think that tone is necessary.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.413
I appreciate you coming home early,
but it's not enough.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.458
If you have a problem with Gabriel
and you're dead-set against daycare,

13:12.541 --> 13:16.378
then let's start interviewing nannies,
because I need five hours a day.

13:18.005 --> 13:21.926
Stop rubbing your face like
a crazy person and use your words.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.844
Three years old, right?

13:23.928 --> 13:27.097
We agreed that before we started
talking about nannies and daycare,

13:27.181 --> 13:28.891
the girls would be <i>three years old.</i>

13:29.016 --> 13:31.727
And it's not the U.S. fucking
Constitution. This is a discussion we had

13:31.810 --> 13:34.104
-a million years ago.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.774
Ever since <i>Hannah</i>
moved in next door,

13:36.857 --> 13:40.236
the only thing I can say that doesn't
piss you off is "Yes, honey."

13:40.736 --> 13:42.154
And it's bullshit.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.663
Me, wine, bathtub.
You know the drill.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.339
Fucking Fluppies.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.593
Jett did the sweetest thing.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.053
She saw this man -

14:06.178 --> 14:07.763
quite dirty with
this long, tangled beard...

14:07.888 --> 14:08.931
Oh.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.308
...walking along this rocky road,
and you know what she did?

14:11.392 --> 14:15.145
She gave that man
her favourite Isabel Marant sandals.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.773
How amazing.

14:17.898 --> 14:21.777
It's, uh, breathtaking, apparently.
Really?

14:21.902 --> 14:24.697
Building a bridge,
one act of kindness at time,

14:24.780 --> 14:26.991
never asking for recognition or--

14:27.074 --> 14:30.202
-I got a gorgeous photo.
-It's being framed as we speak.

14:30.327 --> 14:33.789
Kim has such an eye.
We only had to reenact once.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.833
You can see it on our Instagram
and Facebook pages.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.002
And in the July issue
of <i>Curve</i> magazine.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.587
That's so selfless.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.297
It's really... touching.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.508
But... that's not why
we invited you.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.177
We're adopting a baby.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.929
Yay!

14:49.013 --> 14:50.514
Wait, I thought
we all knew that.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.558
Kylie said that's why
you went to Venezuela.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.227
But... it's official now!

14:57.062 --> 14:57.938
Ah!

14:58.063 --> 15:00.232
Oh, sit... not necessary.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.783
Oh, no.
I'm... I'm okay. Thank you.

15:09.867 --> 15:13.120
You don't like the 2011 Bordeaux?
We practically stole it.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.540
350 for a Wine Spectator Top 25.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.834
Don't tell anyone.
We could get arrested.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.338
Oh, well, head for the border.
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.217
So, when's your bundle of joy
gonna show up?

15:28.552 --> 15:31.472
Do you plan to adopt or inseminate?
I think you should adopt.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.474
There's so many children in this world--

15:33.557 --> 15:35.517
Neither of us wants any children of any shape, size, or colour.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.731
Is she gonna be okay?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.818
She walked into a wall
right before we came here,

15:44.902 --> 15:46.695
and I'm beginning to think
she's concussed...

15:46.779 --> 15:47.863
-Excuse me.
-...so we should probably

15:47.947 --> 15:50.407
just get her out of here
and to a hospital, like, right away.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.578
-Come on. Let's go, babe.
-Thank you for having me.

What's...?

16:20.604 --> 16:22.189
Is something the matter?

16:22.815 --> 16:26.068
Yeah. My stalker dad showed up again.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.737
There's this persistent
little voice in my head -saying that he's up to something.
-Hmm.

16:32.574 --> 16:36.537
You think your estranged father
came to town to pull off a long con,

16:36.620 --> 16:39.331
-Shut up.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.000
Ow!

16:44.211 --> 16:46.338
I got an idea.
Why don't we take him to dinner?

16:46.422 --> 16:48.424
Oh, yeah.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.428
Aw, my boyfriend meeting my dad.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.349
I mean, if he hadn't been an adulterous
drunk who abandoned me

16:57.433 --> 16:59.393
and you and I hadn't met
while I was escorting

16:59.476 --> 17:01.562
and then started pulling
threesomes with your wife,

17:01.645 --> 17:05.107
then that would be
so fucking  adorable.

17:10.821 --> 17:11.989
Wait. You're serious?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.991
I am serious.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.035
You want to meet my dad?

17:16.994 --> 17:19.288
We both know you were born
without an intuition gland,

17:19.371 --> 17:23.917
so I can smoke him out,
see if he's on the up and up.

17:24.001 --> 17:24.960
What?

17:25.085 --> 17:27.046
And if not... boom.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.422
-I'll take him out.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.059
You're very cute when you're trying
to take care of me.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.652
Jack Trakarsky?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.697
Yes?

18:08.837 --> 18:10.589
-Mm-hmm.
-It's right there.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.049
-Yep.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.842
Oh, it's Nina problems.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.180
I-I didn't even hear it.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.724
Yeah, well,
you know what they say.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.227
Ears: first to go.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.938
Mwah! Bye.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.941
-I thought it was the knees.
-Those, too.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.946
-I almost proposed to Jack.
-That's awesome!

18:34.655 --> 18:35.948
Nina?

18:36.031 --> 18:37.116
Hmm?

18:38.325 --> 18:40.536
Why is Shaun making dinner
in your kitchen?

18:41.036 --> 18:43.497
Oh, wait, wait...
Are you two doing it?

18:43.622 --> 18:45.415
Please. He's basically my slave.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.917
Huh...

18:47.000 --> 18:51.338
Okay, well, then,
I'm gonna go, so...

18:52.089 --> 18:54.967
Can you just add everything
and let it simmer for 15 minutes?

18:55.425 --> 18:58.595
Unfortunately, I can't paint your bedroom
on Saturday anymore.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.772
Okay, whatever that is,
it's not healthy.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.901
Yeah, that would worry me
coming from just about anybody else.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.237
Uh, back to my almost proposal.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.490
Okay. Let's really drill into that
while you massage my feet.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.742
In what world do people
massage your feet all the time?

19:20.826 --> 19:23.162
Mm, I haven't named it yet,
but I'm the queen,

19:23.287 --> 19:26.415
I never get hangovers,
and I can eat whatever I want.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.083
Spill it... So, how did you go

19:28.167 --> 19:30.502
from "Slow the fuck down"
to almost proposing?

19:31.378 --> 19:35.299
Okay, I love him, he wants to meet
my dad, there was pizza.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.050
Oh, yeah, heady blend.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.970
Dude, the words
were in my mouth.

19:40.053 --> 19:43.891
Five more seconds, I would have
a ring on my finger.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.517
What ring?
There's... there's a ring?

19:45.642 --> 19:47.519
Yeah, well, I-I'm not sure,

19:47.603 --> 19:51.231
but I-I think he hid my engagement ring
in his underwear drawer.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.858
You haven't looked?

19:52.983 --> 19:56.195
-No. No, no, no, no, no.
-Ooh, interesting.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.071
And why do you think that is?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.615
Um...

20:01.158 --> 20:03.410
Well, it's obvious.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.038
I'm... I'm terrified
that it's really there,

20:06.121 --> 20:07.956
and I'm equally terrified
that it's not.

20:08.040 --> 20:12.211
Mm!
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.963
Okay, so what happened
after you almost proposed?

20:15.088 --> 20:16.298
Well, that's the thing.

20:16.381 --> 20:20.427
I-I-I faked a Nina emergency,
and I, like, ran the fuck out of there.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.930
Okay, so you parent-trapped him
with his wife,

20:23.013 --> 20:24.890
pulled the nostalgic threesome
with her,

20:24.973 --> 20:27.601
you shot down his proposal to you,

20:27.684 --> 20:30.646
almost proposed to him,
and then you randomly sprinted out?

20:30.771 --> 20:32.356
-No, there's no point.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.775
It just makes me feel way better
about my own mental health.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.693
Like, I feel really good
about myself right now.

some five-star bullshit

21:10.143 --> 21:12.354

than the bullshit itself.

Please. Anything.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.997
It's a lazy and shitty excuse,

but I honestly have no idea
how it happened.

we... we both realized -it was a massive--

Yeah.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.261
Absolutely.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.066
Meaning this is still not
something you want?

24:04.401 --> 24:06.153
It's not something that we want?

so I couldn't resist.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.232
Come here.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.902
Don't put the words
"pee" and "your face"

24:46.985 --> 24:49.487
that close together
in a sentence again.

24:50.488 --> 24:51.698

24:52.532 --> 24:53.909

25:00.999 --> 25:03.501

two months ago

25:03.585 --> 25:05.086
that I would be saying this,

25:05.170 --> 25:07.923
I would've laughed
in your face, but...

25:10.342 --> 25:12.135
I do want you to meet my father.

25:12.844 --> 25:13.887
Yeah?

25:15.347 --> 25:17.849
He's been walking me to school
for over a month,

25:17.933 --> 25:21.728
and he's always on time
and he always brings me coffee.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.065
He asks about you.

25:25.148 --> 25:29.653
