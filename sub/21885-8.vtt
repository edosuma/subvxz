00:03.087 --> 00:04.172
Hello, Michael.

00:04.631 --> 00:06.257
Shut the door. Have a seat.

00:08.218 --> 00:12.347
When you proposed this new form of torture,
we all laughed behind your back.

00:12.430 --> 00:15.808
Some people called you names,
like "The Thomas Edison of Incompetence"

00:16.226 --> 00:17.644
or, "That Dick."

00:17.727 --> 00:18.895
Mm-hm.

00:19.479 --> 00:21.898
But against all odds,
it seems you've pulled it off.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.733
What you've done here is truly amazing.

00:23.816 --> 00:26.653
Really?
- Yes. These reports are remarkable.

00:26.736 --> 00:28.905
Your humans are experiencing
emotional torture

00:28.947 --> 00:30.657
at the same level of physical torture

00:30.740 --> 00:32.951
created by our squiggliest
Eyeball Corkscrews.

00:33.326 --> 00:34.869
I'm... jubilant.

00:35.954 --> 00:39.332
As a result of our success,
I'm getting a seat on the High Council.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.876
We will greatly expand our Neighbourhood idea

00:41.918 --> 00:44.087
and you will oversee the entire project.

00:44.337 --> 00:45.630
You are being promoted.

00:48.675 --> 00:51.010
Your Senior Staff Pin. Congratulations.

00:51.386 --> 00:53.137
This is everything you've ever wanted.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.723
This is everything I've ever wanted.

00:55.807 --> 00:56.683
Oh!

00:57.809 --> 00:59.894
This is everything I've ever wanted!

01:00.687 --> 01:01.980
Oh, wow!

01:02.063 --> 01:04.607
- You're really happy?
- Can't you tell?

01:04.899 --> 01:06.901
I'm basically squealing like a birthday girl.

01:15.159 --> 01:18.037
At some point, we should finish discussing
yesterday's events.

01:18.621 --> 01:20.582
Do you mean us almost getting married

01:20.623 --> 01:22.542
and then finding out I was married to Janet

01:22.625 --> 01:25.044
and then Janet making a boyfriend
to forget me

01:25.086 --> 01:26.921
and then Janet getting rid of that boyfriend?

01:27.964 --> 01:30.466
Or do you mean when we saw that cool cloud?

01:31.050 --> 01:32.302
The first bit.

01:32.385 --> 01:35.847
Perhaps later, after Michael briefs us on how
we're going to be fake-tortured today

01:35.888 --> 01:37.473
we can just sit down and have a chat?

01:38.266 --> 01:40.643
Yes. Good idea.

01:41.394 --> 01:42.562
Yo, Chidi?
- Yeah?

01:42.645 --> 01:44.731
You wanna hear about a cool cloud I saw?

01:48.776 --> 01:49.694
Come in.

01:51.821 --> 01:56.951
I'd like to start by saying something
I've wanted to say for a very long time.

01:57.035 --> 02:01.247
Surprise, idiots!
You're all in the Bad Place!

02:04.667 --> 02:06.169
That's right, nerds!

02:06.252 --> 02:11.341
Everything around you, all you can see,
is an elaborate system of torture

02:11.424 --> 02:13.635
designed just for you.

02:14.218 --> 02:17.722
Sorry... we're in the Bad Place?

02:17.805 --> 02:20.224
Why are you revealing this now?

02:20.308 --> 02:24.103
Well, it was an experiment, and it worked,
so my boss is promoting me.

02:24.187 --> 02:27.190
Sorry, I should've introduced you.
This is my boss, Shawn.

02:27.273 --> 02:28.858
Hello, imbeciles.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.194
We need to study everything
that happened here.

02:31.277 --> 02:34.572
There was a first version that collapsed,
but the second has been a huge success.

02:34.656 --> 02:35.990
We'll be shutting this place down.

02:36.032 --> 02:38.159
The four of you
will be brought to the real Bad Place

02:38.201 --> 02:42.121
where your brains will be removed, studied,
and batted about a stadium like beach balls.

02:42.205 --> 02:45.249
Your arms will be peeled like bananas -
that part's just for fun.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.210
Right.
- And then you will be...

02:47.293 --> 02:49.545
you know, tortured forever.

02:50.713 --> 02:54.550
Michael, is this all true?
- Yes, Eleanor, it is.

02:54.634 --> 02:58.429
You're such a rube, thinking you could
become a better person.

02:59.013 --> 03:02.266
You got Chidi
to teach you stupid philosophy

03:03.226 --> 03:05.978
like those old farts
were going to provide guidance.

03:06.354 --> 03:10.775
"Oh, Kierkegaard is so great,
have you read 'Fear and Trembling'?"

03:10.858 --> 03:13.945
"Well, I don't know,
have you read 'Boring and Stupid'?"

03:14.362 --> 03:16.030
Because that's what you are.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.448
Nice.
- Thank you.

03:17.532 --> 03:19.283
How long will it take you
to shut down the Neighbourhood?

03:19.367 --> 03:20.827
Better part of a day, I'd guess.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.287
In the meantime, why don't we
have a "farewell" party here tonight?

03:23.371 --> 03:25.957
You know, just to thank the crew
for all the hard work?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.625
We can jam to some tunes, you know?

03:27.709 --> 03:31.087
Destroy the place, play beer pong
with Jason's testicles...

03:31.170 --> 03:32.588
What do you say, boss?
- Sure.

03:32.672 --> 03:35.258
By the way, I know what you're thinking.
"Maybe Janet can help."

03:35.341 --> 03:36.801
Ah...
- You're wrong. Janet?

03:38.177 --> 03:39.971
Oh, hi, little cuties!

03:40.012 --> 03:42.223
I love you guys so much.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.517
Except for you, Jason, because I hate you.

03:45.101 --> 03:47.437
- I hate you.
- Janet? What's wrong?

03:47.520 --> 03:48.980
Oh! Where's my phone?

03:49.063 --> 03:52.483
We put a Restraining Bracelet on her,
disrupting her powers.

03:52.567 --> 03:56.654
It's made of mag-a-nets.
Magnets. Mag-a-nittens...

03:57.947 --> 04:01.743
Magnets are supposed to make me feel drunk,
but guess what? I feel fine.

04:04.412 --> 04:09.625
I can't believe Michael betrayed us again.
Why is it always the ones you most expect?

04:09.709 --> 04:13.296
I should've seen this coming.
No one can ever truly "turn over a new leaf."

04:13.379 --> 04:16.883
Sure, Ben Affleck told me he'd matured
as an artist after he directed "Argo"

04:16.966 --> 04:18.926
but then, right on schedule, it was

04:19.010 --> 04:21.387
"Guess what, Tahani? I'm gonna be Batman!"

04:21.429 --> 04:22.764
There's only one option.

04:22.805 --> 04:26.726
Shawn clearly doesn't know that Michael
has rebooted this Neighbourhood 800 times.

04:26.809 --> 04:29.645
I say we trade that information
for some kind of reduced sentence.

04:29.729 --> 04:30.897
Chidi, they're monsters!

04:30.980 --> 04:33.983
Who's to say they won't agree to a deal,
hear what we have to say

04:34.066 --> 04:37.278
and then turn around and install us
into their horrible human zoo?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.571
There's no other option.

04:38.613 --> 04:40.907
There's no way for a human
to get that bracelet off of Janet.

04:40.990 --> 04:44.368
If there were, we could get her to call us
a train to Mindy St Claire's house.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.830
We know for a fact that the people
from the Bad Place can't follow us there

04:47.914 --> 04:49.916
- and I vote for that.
- I vote we...

04:49.999 --> 04:54.295
No, sorry, and no offense, Jason,
but the stakes here are too high

04:54.378 --> 04:58.132
to let someone with your limited
intellectual processing capacity weigh in.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.510
I was gonna agree with you.
- Oh, great.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.595
Well, that's two votes for my plan.

05:02.637 --> 05:04.222
Eleanor. What do you think?

05:04.305 --> 05:07.475
Trade information on Michael,
or try to escape to the Medium Place?

05:08.518 --> 05:09.560
Neither.

05:09.894 --> 05:11.813
I vote we ignore everything Michael just said

05:11.896 --> 05:13.940
and blindly assume he's still on our side.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.359
Who's with me?

05:17.443 --> 05:19.195
Sorry, but when all this started

05:19.612 --> 05:22.198
you're the one who told us
that Michael wasn't trustworthy.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.492
- Now you want us to trust him?
- Yes.

05:24.534 --> 05:28.079
For one very specific and rock-solid reason.

05:28.663 --> 05:29.705
What's-his-name!

05:30.248 --> 05:31.123
Who?

05:31.207 --> 05:33.459
The dude! The super-depressing religious guy.

05:33.543 --> 05:35.670
The real buzzkill, whose name
I can never remember.

05:36.087 --> 05:37.839
Keeblers... car.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.966
Kyra... Sedgwick?

05:40.049 --> 05:42.552
Oh, I love her! Dear friend of mine.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.387
Not important right now.

05:44.804 --> 05:46.055
Kierkegaard?
- Yes!

05:46.138 --> 05:48.474
Kierkegaard! When Michael was mocking us

05:48.558 --> 05:51.644
about trying to become better people,
whose name did he use, huh?

05:52.478 --> 05:55.356
Kierkegaard.
I think he was sending us a message.

05:55.439 --> 05:56.691
To take a leap of faith.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.317
Cos that was Kierkegaard's thing, right?

05:58.401 --> 06:02.113
Yes, although it's probably
better translated as a "leap into faith."

06:02.196 --> 06:04.824
It's so hard to be your friend.
- Yup. Sorry.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.784
Michael was telling us to trust him!

06:06.868 --> 06:10.746
I had a long talk with him the other night,
about the whole Derek incident.

06:10.830 --> 06:16.168
Dude was shook - talking about ethics,
and all spiralling about human stuff.

06:16.252 --> 06:18.170
I think he's on our side.

06:18.254 --> 06:21.507
Or maybe, he's a supernatural demon
designed to torture people

06:21.591 --> 06:23.259
who just got offered his dream job

06:23.342 --> 06:25.553
and has flipped on us
like a ten-stone griddle-chip!

06:26.596 --> 06:30.808
It's a large pancake. Come on, people,
you can get these from context!

06:30.892 --> 06:33.144
Look, maybe Michael jumped back
to the dark side.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.520
But I don't think so.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.981
I think he's going to help us escape.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.359
I know it sounds crazy,
but if it weren't crazy

06:40.443 --> 06:42.945
they wouldn't call it a "leap of faith."

06:43.029 --> 06:47.450
They would call it a... "sit of doubting."

06:49.577 --> 06:51.412
I never thought I'd be the one to say it...

06:52.288 --> 06:54.040
but this is getting out of hand.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.500
I think we gotta go to the cops.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.712
What cops? Where do you think we are?

07:02.089 --> 07:06.093
Before tonight's party I'd love to talk more
about your strategy for torturing Tahani.

07:06.177 --> 07:08.554
I'm impressed you were able
to make her fall in love with Jason.

07:08.638 --> 07:10.723
She must be... miserable.

07:10.806 --> 07:14.435
Yeah, humans make a lot of mistakes
when they're horny.

07:17.229 --> 07:19.607
Ah, boss... Give me a second, here.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.319
What the here, dude?
- Vicky...

07:23.402 --> 07:27.073
My hard work paid off for you,
and now you're just taking all the credit.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.784
Vicky, Vicky... this can work out great
for both of us

07:29.867 --> 07:31.369
if we play our cards right.

07:31.452 --> 07:34.580
Shawn thinks that this is attempt
number two, right?

07:34.664 --> 07:37.124
Now if I tell him that you've been in charge
of this version

07:37.166 --> 07:40.878
he's eventually gonna find out that there
have been hundreds of failed versions.

07:40.962 --> 07:43.464
Ohhhhh! Right.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.591
And if that happens, we're all going down.

07:45.675 --> 07:49.553
So, spread the word.
No one talks about the reboots.

07:50.346 --> 07:52.431
Fine. But you better make this right.

07:52.515 --> 07:55.184
Mama want promotion, ya heard?

08:02.900 --> 08:06.487
Hello, you dummies!

08:07.071 --> 08:10.449
This Neighbourhood was a labour
of hate for many people here

08:10.533 --> 08:14.370
so I thought that we should celebrate
with an art form

08:14.453 --> 08:18.165
that we literally invented here
in the Bad Place

08:18.290 --> 08:20.209
the "comedy roast"!

08:23.421 --> 08:25.715
I see Jason Mendoza's here.

08:25.798 --> 08:28.050
Jason might not be
the smartest guy in the world

08:28.134 --> 08:31.220
but he is the dumbest guy in the world.

08:32.430 --> 08:33.764
Ah, Jason, buddy.

08:33.848 --> 08:36.142
All you had to do was to keep quiet

08:36.225 --> 08:39.895
but you couldn't stop talking
about Kendall Jenner

08:39.979 --> 08:41.897
or that dumb quarterback, what was his name?

08:41.981 --> 08:45.818
Derek Bortles...
always ranting about "Derek Bortles."

08:46.235 --> 08:50.781
Lucky for you, my friend, Jaguars games
are the only ones televised in the Bad Place

08:50.865 --> 08:52.867
because they suuuuck!

08:55.453 --> 08:59.206
No, they don't! All we need is a defense,
and an offense, and some rule changes.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.624
Don't take it personally.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.877
He just has to put on a show
for the other demons.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.713
Tahani Al-Jamil.

09:06.172 --> 09:08.799
Elegance, grace, sophistication...

09:08.883 --> 09:10.885
But enough about your sister!

09:13.012 --> 09:16.307
Do you know what the worst moment
of Tahani's life was?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.976
When the last song played
at one of her parties

09:19.060 --> 09:23.439
and she would run off and cry because
she still hadn't won her parents' approval.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.984
You know the other worst moment
of Tahani's life?

09:27.068 --> 09:31.405
Every other moment of her empty,
pointless life!

09:31.489 --> 09:33.741
Hey-o!

09:33.824 --> 09:35.868
I see Eleanor Shellstrop is here.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.579
Eleanor and I have a lot in common.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.414
Now here's how you can tell us apart.

09:40.498 --> 09:42.625
One of us is a manipulative demon

09:42.708 --> 09:45.294
who's an expert
at making other people miserable...

09:45.711 --> 09:47.963
and then the other one is me!

09:49.965 --> 09:54.386
You thought you deserved a Medium Place,
like Mindy St Claire?

09:54.595 --> 09:55.888
Are you kidding me?

09:56.430 --> 09:57.598
You're bad, Eleanor.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.935
This is exactly the place you should be.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.562
Not super funny for a roast, there, bud.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.814
Oh, sorry, you want a joke? OK.

10:04.855 --> 10:08.609
You love Chidi and Chidi doesn't
love you back. Boom!

10:09.860 --> 10:13.572
Now, that's funny because it's
very cruel and humiliating.

10:14.115 --> 10:16.117
I consider you one of my closest friends.
- Not now, dude.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.326
Speaking of Chidi...

10:17.368 --> 10:20.037
is something no one has ever said

10:20.121 --> 10:21.997
because no one talks about Chidi

10:22.081 --> 10:26.794
because no one likes Chidi,
because he's so annoying about ethics!

10:28.045 --> 10:30.256
Now when you taught the Trolley Problem...

10:30.339 --> 10:35.344
did you secretly wish that it could be you
who wound up under the trolley?

10:35.719 --> 10:37.346
Because all your students did!

10:37.388 --> 10:39.014
Whoo!

10:39.098 --> 10:41.225
Oh, Chidi, sorry, I got a joke for you, bud.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.644
Uh, knock-knock.
- Who's there?

10:43.727 --> 10:46.063
You died alone
because you couldn't commit to anyone!

10:47.690 --> 10:50.025
"You died alone because you couldn't commit
to anyone" who?

10:50.109 --> 10:52.027
No...
- Jason Mendoza!

10:54.113 --> 10:59.743
OK, that's all my time.
Let's tear this mother to the ground!

10:59.827 --> 11:01.996
Whoo!

11:06.834 --> 11:11.463
So, maybe I was wrong,
and Michael isn't on our side.

11:15.176 --> 11:16.510
What up, fork sticks?!

11:16.552 --> 11:19.513
That was "She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.434
Coming up next,
"Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer!"

11:23.851 --> 11:25.895
Idiots!

11:26.228 --> 11:29.231
We're going streaking! Ahhhh!

11:30.816 --> 11:31.859
Ugh.

11:32.484 --> 11:36.447
The one time I think someone isn't lying
to me and it bites me in the ash.

11:36.530 --> 11:40.201
I guess Michael really did flip back
to the bad side.

11:40.284 --> 11:41.493
Oh, does one think?

11:41.577 --> 11:43.829
That roast was the meanest thing
I've ever seen

11:43.913 --> 11:46.665
and I once saw a waiter
bring Russell Crowe the wrong tea.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.210
Well, we have no choice.
We go to Shawn and we tell him

11:49.293 --> 11:51.128
that we'll trade secret information
about the reboots

11:51.212 --> 11:52.338
if he'll go easy on us.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.673
And if that doesn't work,
we try to get Janet free

11:54.757 --> 11:56.592
and head to Mindy's. Agreed?

11:56.675 --> 11:58.344
Yeah. Michael sucks now.

11:58.427 --> 12:01.639
He pretended to be our friend,
he's gonna torture us for eternity...

12:01.680 --> 12:03.307
And you know what the worst part is?

12:03.390 --> 12:06.268
He doesn't remember the name
of my favourite football player.

12:06.352 --> 12:07.686
Definitely not the worst part.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.063
It is to me!

12:09.146 --> 12:13.400
"Blake Bortles" is a cool name.
"Derek Bortles" is a dumb name!

12:15.027 --> 12:19.031
<i>♪ Grandma got run over by a reindeer ♪</i>

12:19.907 --> 12:22.409
<i>♪ Walking home from our house
Christmas Eve... ♪</i>

12:23.953 --> 12:28.207
Hey, man, have you told Shawn
how "hugely important" I was yet?

12:28.290 --> 12:29.917
I will get to it. Promise.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.878
Now, you just relax, enjoy yourself,
rip a cat in half

12:32.920 --> 12:34.463
it's a party, Vicky! Come on!

12:36.840 --> 12:37.925
Hey!
- Mleh?

12:38.008 --> 12:40.010
What does Michael keep whispering to you?
- Um....

12:40.094 --> 12:43.097
"Something, something,
Vicky, something, something."

12:43.180 --> 12:45.432
Awww! Can I braid your hair?
- No.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.268
Please?
- No. You know what? I'm good. I got it.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.394
- Ooh!
- Hey!

12:48.477 --> 12:50.229
Help me get these bracelets off Good Janet.

12:50.312 --> 12:52.356
No. Shawn put them on her for a reason.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.108
I'm not overruling the boss.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.526
You're such a suck-up, Gayle.

12:56.110 --> 12:58.237
Can I braid your hair?
- No. Get this... I got it.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.363
Ow!
- OK...

12:59.446 --> 13:02.116
Get your own bracelets, Victoria!

13:05.869 --> 13:07.413
OK, you fat dinks.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.040
The sun is up,
and we're about to close it down

13:10.124 --> 13:11.792
with one last song -

13:12.084 --> 13:14.253
"She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd

13:14.336 --> 13:19.216
<i>and</i> "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"
played at the same time.

13:20.259 --> 13:23.387
Honestly, I'm still partial
to the old-fashioned scorpion diapers.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.972
But you've done great work here.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.391
Can't thank you enough for everything.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.560
Shawn, wait!
- No...

13:29.643 --> 13:31.812
I have some very interesting information

13:31.854 --> 13:34.064
about who's really responsible
for this Neighbourhood.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.566
Shawn! The humans are escaping!

13:39.236 --> 13:41.905
It's Michael. Michael's responsible
for this Neighbourhood

13:41.989 --> 13:44.408
and everything that's happening right now.
Byeee!

13:44.742 --> 13:46.285
Ah, I...
- Bad Janet!

13:46.368 --> 13:48.495
What's cracking, nutbutts?

13:48.579 --> 13:51.623
Call us another train, immediately.
Party's over.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.420
How did they get Janet's bracelets off?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.714
It's literally impossible for a human to do.

13:58.797 --> 14:02.301
It's like breathing underwater,
or driving without texting.

14:02.384 --> 14:06.055
Shawn, I don't want to make any accusations,
but I accuse Vicky.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.515
She asked me to help her take
Janet's bracelets off.

14:08.599 --> 14:10.684
Oh, Vicky, you didn't!

14:10.768 --> 14:12.019
She definitely did.

14:12.102 --> 14:15.356
She's jealous, she's been trying
to sabotage me the entire time.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.066
What, no? He's lying.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.486
OK, I did try to get the bracelets off,
but I couldn't.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.279
Listen to yourself. You sound crazy.

14:22.363 --> 14:26.408
Normally I would love hearing a man
tell a woman she's crazy, but I can't.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.660
You aided the humans just to spite Michael.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.579
You're not a demon. You're a jerk.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.955
Wait! This is a trick!

14:32.039 --> 14:33.457
Michael is the traitor.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.334
I bet they're still here somehow.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.128
This place stretches for a thousand miles.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.089
Fine. Bad Janet?

14:40.172 --> 14:43.217
- What?
- Scan the Neighbourhood, please.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.144
No sign of any humans,
but I actually did find something for Vicky.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.231
What?

14:59.441 --> 15:01.610
Bad Janet, great stuff as always.
- No, duh.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.487
And as for Vicky...
- No, wait!

15:05.155 --> 15:08.158
This is a PR disaster.
We have to keep it all under wraps.

15:08.242 --> 15:09.368
Get her on the train.

15:09.451 --> 15:13.205
And if anyone else says a single word
of what happened here, to anyone...

15:13.288 --> 15:15.207
you will be in a cocoon just like Vicky

15:15.290 --> 15:18.293
and it is gooey in there.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.421
How do we get the humans back from Mindy's?

15:20.504 --> 15:22.589
They bought themselves some time,
but we'll get them.

15:22.673 --> 15:24.341
I'll start the extradition papers.

15:24.425 --> 15:27.636
You stay here. I want every trace
of this Neighbourhood erased.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.231
Oh, that was a bad idea!

15:39.314 --> 15:41.692
That was so scary,
so many different times. I hated that.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.281
You guys!

15:48.407 --> 15:50.576
I was so scared for you!

15:50.659 --> 15:52.411
I told you he was on our side!

15:52.494 --> 15:54.872
You're my friends, and I wanted...

15:55.497 --> 15:58.542
I wanted to save you...
- Hey, it's OK, bud.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.587
This is the best summer ever, you guys!

16:01.670 --> 16:03.380
Ohhh!

16:04.465 --> 16:05.340
Oh!

16:06.508 --> 16:08.886
Oh, Michael,
we never doubted you for a moment.

16:08.969 --> 16:09.970
Thank you, Tahani.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.513
You're lying, though, right?

16:11.597 --> 16:13.265
Yes, I am. I doubted you very strongly.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.641
But then I figured it out.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.143
Kierkegaard, baby!

16:16.226 --> 16:17.269
Leap of faith!

16:17.352 --> 16:20.105
It's better translated as a
"leap into faith."

16:20.189 --> 16:21.231
You remembered!

16:23.025 --> 16:25.110
Can somebody please explain what happened?

16:25.194 --> 16:27.779
And... and can you guys just be...
a tiny bit quieter?

16:27.863 --> 16:30.365
Because, um...
I've been drunk on magnets all day and...

16:30.449 --> 16:33.911
and I can literally
hear every sound in the universe.

16:33.994 --> 16:37.873
Basically, Michael sent us a code,
and we had to crack it.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.334
- I figured out the first clue.
- No, you didn't. I did.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.419
- I was there, though!
- Ooh...

16:42.503 --> 16:46.465
"Blake Bortles" is a cool name.
"Derek Bortles" is a dumb name.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.383
Yes...

16:48.467 --> 16:53.222
"Derek Bortles" is indeed a very dumb name.

16:53.764 --> 16:54.890
It's a clue!

16:54.973 --> 16:57.935
There's no way Michael
would've forgotten the name "Blake Bortles."

16:57.976 --> 16:59.520
You say it a million times a day.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.563
Cos he's the best.
- No, he's not.

17:01.605 --> 17:02.564
And even I know that.

17:02.648 --> 17:06.360
Michael was telling us to use Derek,
Janet's Derek, for something.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.196
There were clues in the roast.

17:09.279 --> 17:12.366
Everybody, quietly, but quickly,
head to the train station.

17:12.658 --> 17:15.244
But let's split up so we don't draw
attention.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.837
Ugh, you guys are the worst conspirators!

17:27.589 --> 17:31.385
OK, what else did Michael say
in the roasts that might be meaningful?

17:31.468 --> 17:32.678
Tahani? Do you remember?

17:32.761 --> 17:35.389
Well, he said my entire life
was pointless and empty.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.599
Yeah, but did he say anything
we don't already know?

17:37.683 --> 17:39.142
Anything that stood out?

17:39.726 --> 17:43.647
<i>Do you know what the worst moment
of Tahani's life was?</i>

17:43.730 --> 17:46.483
<i>When the last song
played at one of her parties</i>

17:46.567 --> 17:50.946
<i>and she would run off and cry because
she still hadn't won her parents' approval.</i>

17:51.029 --> 17:52.447
That <i>was</i> odd.

17:52.531 --> 17:55.033
A host never runs off during their last song

17:55.117 --> 17:56.159
because after it's over

17:56.243 --> 17:58.495
you're supposed to act surprised
when everyone drags you on stage

17:58.579 --> 17:59.580
and showers you with applause.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.874
Maybe Michael wanted us
to wait until the end of the party

18:02.958 --> 18:05.043
when everyone was at their most distracted.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.714
And use Derek to drive the train,
because he has some of Janet's powers.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.300
- Janet?
- Hi... Hi... Hi there.

18:11.383 --> 18:12.426
Janet?
- Yep?

18:12.509 --> 18:14.553
We need you to go get Derek from your void.

18:14.636 --> 18:15.512
OK.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.639
Shoot, where's my void, again? I forget.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.641
Oh, yeah, it's everywhere.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.852
OK, hang on to your...

18:21.935 --> 18:23.604
butt-cheeks.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.439
<i>Ugh... where is he?</i>

18:25.480 --> 18:27.566
<i>Ow! Owwy! Ugh!</i>

18:27.608 --> 18:29.610
<i>I'm never gonna find... oop, there he is!</i>

18:29.693 --> 18:31.570
- Derek.
- Derek!

18:31.653 --> 18:35.198
We need you to drive this train,
and take us to Mindy St Claire's house.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.617
Can you do that?

18:36.658 --> 18:37.534
Derek.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.120
Wait.

18:40.579 --> 18:41.705
Nobody get on that train.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.832
Derek?
- Why not?

18:43.915 --> 18:45.292
Because of what Michael said to me.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.378
<i>You thought you deserved a Medium Place?</i>

18:48.462 --> 18:51.923
<i>You're bad, Eleanor.
This is exactly the place you should be.</i>

18:52.799 --> 18:53.925
Derek!

18:54.009 --> 18:56.178
Michael wants us to stay here,
for some reason.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.931
Eleanor. We have a train, a conductor,
and a safe destination.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.058
I'm gonna tell you the same thing

19:01.141 --> 19:04.311
I told Pippa Middleton right before
we went paragliding in Gibraltar.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.646
"Let's go!"

19:06.688 --> 19:09.191
What? It's what I said.
- Guys, leap of faith.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.568
Michael said we shouldn't get on that train.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.654
Any minute now, those demons
are gonna come looking for us.

19:13.737 --> 19:16.490
Where are we supposed to hide? Oh, no!

19:16.573 --> 19:20.118
<i>Now when you taught the Trolley Problem,
did you secretly wish</i>

19:20.202 --> 19:23.830
<i>that it could be you
who wound up under the trolley?</i>

19:24.206 --> 19:25.999
<i>Because all your students did!</i>

19:26.083 --> 19:28.919
All aboard the...

19:29.002 --> 19:31.713
Shhh!
- DEREK, QUIETLY:...train is here!

19:31.797 --> 19:33.507
It's a train!
- Shhh!

19:33.590 --> 19:35.217
Get onboard!

19:35.300 --> 19:36.385
Actually, Derek...

19:36.468 --> 19:37.844
Derek.
- You're gonna wait

19:37.928 --> 19:40.138
until the last song of the night.
- Derek.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.974
And when you do leave,
you're gonna be flying a solo mission.

19:43.058 --> 19:46.144
Oh! Maximum Derek!

19:46.269 --> 19:47.270
<i>Derek headed off</i>

19:47.312 --> 19:50.107
and when the new train arrived,
the four of us crawled underneath

19:50.190 --> 19:52.192
before any of the drunk demons saw us.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.903
That kept us from being detected
when Bad Janet scanned the Neighbourhood.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.739
We fooled those mo-fos like the chumps
they are!

19:58.323 --> 20:00.409
We got all four clues you left us!

20:00.492 --> 20:01.618
Oh, that's great.

20:01.702 --> 20:05.706
Well, I mean, I actually left you
more than 1,200 clues

20:05.789 --> 20:07.916
because of how primitive your brains are.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.752
But I'm so glad
you got enough to figure it out.

20:10.836 --> 20:13.046
Wait, how did you escape detection though?

20:13.130 --> 20:17.384
Well, I'm not ethically proud of this,
but I framed Vicky.

20:17.467 --> 20:21.972
It was pretty easy - I just kept whispering
things into Janet's ear to make her paranoid.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.933
I'm sorry, what... what did you whisper
to me? I don't remember.

20:26.518 --> 20:29.521
Something, something, Vicky,
something, something.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.273
What does Michael keep whispering to you?

20:31.356 --> 20:34.484
"Something, something, Vicky,
something, something."

20:34.526 --> 20:35.402
Aw!

20:35.444 --> 20:38.029
<i>And that made her try to take
Janet's bracelets off...</i>

20:38.071 --> 20:39.614
which framed her for the escape.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.199
Oh!

20:41.283 --> 20:45.162
Guys, I... I want to apologise
for roasting you earlier.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.873
I had to sell it because everyone
was watching.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.416
It was funny though, right?

20:49.458 --> 20:52.043
Absolutely not!
- The Tahani stuff was perfect. I mean, no.

20:52.127 --> 20:54.796
Guys. Let's just take a moment here.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.173
They're gone.

20:56.256 --> 20:59.176
Which means that we won
and might actually get a chance

20:59.259 --> 21:00.844
to go to the real Good Place.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.555
This is everything we ever wanted.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.307
Speaking of people getting what they want...

21:05.390 --> 21:08.143
I really hope Mindy liked the present
we sent her.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.314
Who are you?
- Derek!

21:14.691 --> 21:16.943
"Thanks for helping us all those times
we showed up."

21:17.027 --> 21:20.989
"To repay you, here's a willing sex robot
and two duffel bags full of cocaine."
