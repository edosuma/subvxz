00:22.980 --> 00:25.100
(country music playing)

00:25.100 --> 00:27.600
This guy here,
Billy Joe Shaver,

00:27.600 --> 00:31.140
is one of the greatest
country music songwriters
alive today.

00:31.140 --> 00:32.930
The fact that he's alive at all

00:32.930 --> 00:35.770
is pretty unbelievable,
given the life he's lead.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.560
And insider backstage,

00:56.560 --> 00:57.980
an outsider in the business,

00:57.980 --> 01:01.220
Billy Joe Shaver dropped acid
with the Grateful Dead,

01:01.220 --> 01:03.310
picked a fight
with Waylon Jennings,

01:03.310 --> 01:05.850
he married
the same woman
three times,

01:05.850 --> 01:07.810
divorced her
after each one,

01:07.810 --> 01:09.850
and, like almost
everyone else

01:09.850 --> 01:11.390
in this series so far,

01:11.390 --> 01:12.680
he shot a guy.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.770
(theme music playing)

01:27.180 --> 01:28.470
Well, I first met

01:28.470 --> 01:30.140
Billy Joe on the stage.

01:30.140 --> 01:31.600
He was playing a song,

01:31.600 --> 01:32.730
so I just picked up my Hobbs,

01:32.730 --> 01:34.020
started playing with
him, you know?

01:34.020 --> 01:35.310
He said, "Oh, man."

01:35.310 --> 01:37.020
He said, "You can--
you can play that
French harp."

01:37.020 --> 01:38.980
Then he said,
"Why don't you come out
on the road with me?"

01:38.980 --> 01:42.640
The next day,
I get up, pack my stuff,
and I head to Billy Joe's.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.730
Brenda, his wife at the time,
she answered the door

01:44.730 --> 01:46.850
and she said,
"They're downstairs
rehearsing."

01:46.850 --> 01:48.680
So I said, "Okay,"
so I go downstairs.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.520
(chuckles)
And Billy looks at me,
then he looks over at Fred,

01:51.520 --> 01:54.850
and he goes,
"You know, I got
a little buzz on last night."

01:54.850 --> 01:58.310
And he said, "I hired
this crazy Yankee
harmonica player."

01:58.310 --> 02:00.350
He said,
"I can't understand
a word he said."

02:00.350 --> 02:02.890
He said, "We're just
gonna humor him."
(all laugh)

02:02.890 --> 02:05.180
Mike:
These guys know
more about Billy Joe Shaver

02:05.180 --> 02:07.270
than they'd ever
speak about openly.

02:07.270 --> 02:10.770
Roguie Ray LaMontagne
played harmonica with him.

02:10.770 --> 02:12.890
Freddy Fletcher
played drums,

02:12.890 --> 02:14.980
and Don Mealer, well...

02:14.980 --> 02:16.560
I didn't do
much of nothing

02:16.560 --> 02:19.600
except carry drums
and roadie a little.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.310
My nickname is Poobah.

02:21.310 --> 02:22.890
Where is that from, Freddy?

02:22.890 --> 02:24.220
I'd-- I'd go to jail.

02:24.220 --> 02:25.850
(Ray laughs)
I'm not sure where
that comes from.

02:25.850 --> 02:28.060
I thought it came
from The Flintstones.  (laughs)

02:28.060 --> 02:29.810
Billy goes,
"That damn Poobah,

02:29.810 --> 02:33.100
he gets all the girls."
(laughter)

02:33.100 --> 02:34.390
Ray:
"What's with that guy?"

02:34.390 --> 02:35.430
Billy Joe had this van

02:35.430 --> 02:36.470
he called Old Blue

02:36.470 --> 02:37.640
that we traveled in,

02:37.640 --> 02:40.060
and he had it
all kind of fixed up.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.890
There was a bed in the back,
had a couch in there.

02:42.890 --> 02:45.810
We were in a lot
of bad situations
in that van.

02:45.810 --> 02:48.390
We was in Old Blue,
coming up to Canada,

02:48.390 --> 02:51.140
going through the border,
pulling a stolen U-Haul

02:51.140 --> 02:54.770
that we had rented months
and months before.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.930
This was in, uh...
Late '70s.

02:56.930 --> 02:59.100
Yeah, late '70s,
early '80s.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.270
"We're going to Canada.
No drugs."

03:01.270 --> 03:04.270
Billy Joe made a big,
big thing about that.
(chuckles)

03:04.270 --> 03:07.730
"No drugs!
You know they've got
a big checkpoint up here.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.850
We got no drugs, right?"
That's what he's said.

03:09.850 --> 03:11.020
"We're gonna have to pull over."

03:11.020 --> 03:12.430
Ray:
Everybody got out,

03:12.430 --> 03:13.810
was going through their bags.

03:13.810 --> 03:16.310
Freddy:
All the sudden, all this dope's
coming out, you know,

03:16.310 --> 03:19.600
and during those times,
cocaine was real popular.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.600
There's guns coming out,
and there's knives and things
of that nature.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.730
And I had a belt
that had a--

03:25.730 --> 03:29.020
the buckle was actually
a knife in a sheath.

03:29.020 --> 03:32.180
Roguie probably had
some brass knuckles
or something, you know,

03:32.180 --> 03:35.430
and Billy Joe always carried
this little derringer.

03:35.430 --> 03:36.810
He called it his popgun.

03:36.810 --> 03:38.100
He'd carry it in his boot.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.310
Ray:
Billy Joe says,
"We gotta hide it somewhere,"

03:40.310 --> 03:41.680
so there was
a mile marker there.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.140
You have these mile markers
that show you where you are

03:45.140 --> 03:47.980
and how close you're getting
to whatever destination.

03:47.980 --> 03:49.310
So we picked a mile marker

03:49.310 --> 03:53.060
and dug a hole
and stashed all our shit.

03:53.060 --> 03:56.100
But then coming back,
it was like, "Oh man!"

03:56.100 --> 03:58.140
We couldn't remember...
(laughs)

03:58.140 --> 04:02.270
...which mile marker.
(laughter)

04:02.270 --> 04:04.430
I remember going down
the road real slow,

04:04.430 --> 04:06.850
looking...  (laughs)
and, you know.

04:06.850 --> 04:08.980
Freddy:
Things were hazy back then,

04:08.980 --> 04:11.180
but, uh, if we didn't find
our stash,

04:11.180 --> 04:13.180
we headed home pretty quick
to get some more.

04:13.180 --> 04:15.270
(laughter)
(tires squeal)

04:15.270 --> 04:17.680
Mike:
They drove Old Blue
all over North America,

04:17.680 --> 04:21.270
but they always
came back to Texas,
Billy Joe's home state.

04:21.270 --> 04:25.100
He, uh, grew up
with his grandmother
around Corsicana

04:25.100 --> 04:27.600
in the middle of nowhere
in Central Texas--

04:27.600 --> 04:31.470
pretty humble beginnings--
and loved poetry.

04:31.470 --> 04:35.520
Some of the memories are
probably a little painful.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.640
One of the early stories
Billy Joe told me

04:37.640 --> 04:39.890
was that he snuck in
to see Homer and Jethro.

04:39.890 --> 04:43.140
We just know two songs,
and we already sang
one of 'em first...

04:43.140 --> 04:45.850
(laughter)
...so we'd like to do
the other one right now.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.520
We're gonna--
we're gonna do
one here called,

04:48.520 --> 04:51.680
"I Miss My Wife's Cooking
Whenever I Can."

04:51.680 --> 04:55.890
Mike: Henry "Homer" Haynes
and Kenneth "Jethro" Burns

04:55.890 --> 04:58.180
were known as
the Thinking Man's Hillbillies,

04:58.180 --> 05:01.390
a mantle Billy Joe
would one day inherit.

05:01.390 --> 05:04.430
As a kid, they were
the first act he went to see.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.810
I was about eight
or something,

05:05.810 --> 05:09.430
Homer and Jethro were down
at the Miracle Bread Company,

05:09.430 --> 05:12.060
and so I decided,
"Well, I'm gonna sneak out

05:12.060 --> 05:14.850
of the house at night
and go down there."

05:14.850 --> 05:18.730
And I'm barefooted,
got little old overalls on
and no shirt.

05:18.730 --> 05:21.140
But I got there,
and, uh, there was

05:21.140 --> 05:23.770
a crowd of guys,
smoking and drinking.

05:23.770 --> 05:25.980
And I got in there,
and I'm having to jump around

05:25.980 --> 05:27.890
to keep people
from stepping on my feet.

05:27.890 --> 05:30.560
And I decided, "Well,
I'll shimmy up this pole,"

05:30.560 --> 05:33.100
and that's when
they introduced Hank Williams.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.430
♪ Came in last night
at half past ten ♪

05:36.430 --> 05:39.270

Hank:
♪ Move over little... ♪

05:45.930 --> 05:47.810
He just sang
right straight to me,

05:47.810 --> 05:50.930
and when he sang
straight to me,
it lit me up.

05:50.930 --> 05:53.600

05:53.600 --> 05:56.270

05:58.140 --> 06:00.100
Went on home,
got the beating of my life.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.850
My grandma, like, half--
beat me half to death,

06:02.850 --> 06:05.640
but I knew then
what I was gonna do.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.390
A lot of what he drew from
was his experiences.

06:09.390 --> 06:10.770
There's one song called

06:10.770 --> 06:12.770
"I'd Walk Six Miles
of Train Track

06:12.770 --> 06:15.730
to Hear
Hank Williams Sing."
It's a true story.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.980
Mike:
Billy Joe was
gonna write songs,

06:17.980 --> 06:19.930
and to do that,
he needed to experience

06:19.930 --> 06:23.270
a little more of the world
than what he had there
in Corsicana.

06:23.270 --> 06:25.930
Oh, I was about 15
or something like that.

06:25.930 --> 06:29.470
I went over to Boys Town
there in Matamoros.

06:29.470 --> 06:32.600
Mike: Matamoros is just
across the border in Mexico,

06:32.600 --> 06:35.310
about 30 miles
from Brownsville.

06:35.310 --> 06:37.640
Boys Town is in  La Zona Roja,

06:37.640 --> 06:39.470
the red-light district.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.310
As a kid and being a Texan,

06:41.310 --> 06:43.140
I think all the boys ended up,

06:43.140 --> 06:45.390
at one point or another,
going to Boys Town.

06:45.390 --> 06:46.850
There's girls,
there's drugs--

06:46.850 --> 06:48.470
basically anything you want.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.600
You never leave
with a good feeling.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.390
It's lots of fun.
I went into this one
particular joint.

06:54.390 --> 06:56.810
I'm setting there
at the table, drinking,

06:56.810 --> 06:59.850
and all of a sudden,
a bottle whizzed by my head.

07:01.060 --> 07:04.930
So, I started throwing
my bottles at them, too.

07:04.930 --> 07:06.310
(people shouting)

07:06.310 --> 07:08.560
Billy Joe:
And there's bottles
flying everywhere...

07:08.560 --> 07:10.890
(sirens blare)
...and about that time though,

07:10.890 --> 07:12.350
the policia come in

07:12.350 --> 07:14.680
and they grab me,
of course, right off.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.180
He was thrown
in jail in Mexico

07:17.180 --> 07:19.350
at probably 15 years old.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.350
Billy Joe:
I asked this guy
next-door to me,

07:22.350 --> 07:24.810
"Man, I sure could do
with a smoke."

07:24.810 --> 07:28.220
He said, "It's a dollar."
So I handed him a dollar,

07:28.220 --> 07:30.850
and then I realized
I didn't have no matches.

07:30.850 --> 07:34.770
He sold me one match
for a dollar again,

07:34.770 --> 07:36.100
and I go to light it,

07:36.100 --> 07:38.180
and he said,
"Don't do that.
You'll ruin it.

07:38.180 --> 07:42.020
You gotta have
a piece of this here
envelope thing that it came in."

07:42.020 --> 07:44.390
I said,
"Well, man, come on.

07:44.390 --> 07:46.220
You-you-- you mess
with me long enough."

07:46.220 --> 07:48.310
He said,
"Well, this'll be it."

07:48.310 --> 07:50.470
And I handed him my dollar.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.770
And, boy, it was
the best cigarette

07:52.770 --> 07:55.140
I ever smoked
in my whole life.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.060
Anyhow, I got out.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.220
Mike:
Billy Joe made
his way back to Texas

07:59.220 --> 08:01.640
and found a job
at Cameron Mills,

08:01.640 --> 08:04.640
a lumber mill
about an hour south of Waco.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.220
And that's where I got
these fingers cut off.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.890
It was a double-end machine,

08:08.890 --> 08:11.730
and on the side
there was steel deal

08:11.730 --> 08:14.220
with razor blades
all in it, just flying.

08:14.220 --> 08:16.180
You couldn't even see it,
it was going so fast.

08:16.180 --> 08:19.270
My glove got hung in there,
and it didn't have
no safety switch,

08:19.270 --> 08:21.140
and I put my foot up
against the darn thing.

08:22.890 --> 08:24.430
I scooped my fingers up,

08:24.430 --> 08:26.930
and it was so strange,
because I'd just read a--

08:26.930 --> 08:30.930
a deal about these
Japanese people sewing
the fingers back on.

08:30.930 --> 08:32.520
I got in my pickup

08:32.520 --> 08:34.310
and went over
to the doctor's office.

08:34.310 --> 08:35.930
I handed him my fingers.

08:35.930 --> 08:38.270
I said, "Can you sew
these fingers back on?

08:38.270 --> 08:41.270
He said, "What?"
"They do it in Japan."

08:41.270 --> 08:43.270
And he said,
"This is Waco, Texas!"

08:43.270 --> 08:45.350
(laughs)
Did one of those deals on me.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.520
And the nurse there,
she looked at me,

08:47.520 --> 08:51.560
and she said, "Mr. Billy,
can I have them fingers?"

08:51.560 --> 08:53.390
She came out
with a Mason jar--

08:53.390 --> 08:56.220
I swear, it already
had the formaldehyde
and everything in it--

08:56.220 --> 08:59.180
and she just dropped
them fingers down in there.

08:59.180 --> 09:00.850
And she was pretty, too, man.

09:00.850 --> 09:03.020
I figured, "Well,
this is an in, you know?

09:03.020 --> 09:05.270
I'll go to the hospital,
then I'll come back."
(laughs)

09:05.270 --> 09:07.470
Kinky Friedman:
Every story Billy Joe
tells is true.

09:07.470 --> 09:09.930
He doesn't write
any fanciful stuff.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.020
And the idea

09:13.020 --> 09:14.980
that a guitar player like him

09:14.980 --> 09:18.310
would lose his fingers
in a sawmill accident

09:18.310 --> 09:20.220
and have such a great
sense of humor about it--

09:20.220 --> 09:23.980
He always waves to the audience
with that hand, you know.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.770
I mean, that'd be enough
to stop most people.

09:27.770 --> 09:30.640
Mike:
Singer, songwriter,
politician,

09:30.640 --> 09:33.060
and close friend
of Billy Joe Shaver,

09:33.060 --> 09:36.100
Kinky Friedman has known
the man almost all his life.

09:36.100 --> 09:40.270
I just remember me and Billy Joe
scratching around in Nashville.
(dog barking)

09:40.270 --> 09:43.850
Want the dogs barking out there?
Yeah, okay. (spits)

09:43.850 --> 09:46.220
That's part of the ambience?

09:46.220 --> 09:47.890
Well, I tell you what,
we'll put that dog

09:47.890 --> 09:49.730
to sleep, okay?
(barking continues)

09:49.730 --> 09:53.060
Billy Joe adopted
a three-legged dog from us,

09:53.060 --> 09:55.180
from our rescue ranch
for animals.

09:55.180 --> 10:00.430
I knew he would take that dog,
uh, for a lot of reasons.

10:00.430 --> 10:03.270
We always say,
"May the Lord take
a liking to you,"

10:03.270 --> 10:05.600
but the Lord has taken
a liking to Billy Joe.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.180
In spite of all
the tragedy in his life,

10:08.180 --> 10:10.180
almost all of it
self-inflicted--

10:10.180 --> 10:13.600
some of it wasn't,
not when he was
in his mother's womb

10:13.600 --> 10:15.850
and was almost kicked
to death by his father.

10:15.850 --> 10:17.270
♪ ♪

10:17.270 --> 10:20.350
Um, and the mother--
after he was born,
the mother--

10:20.350 --> 10:22.640
the next day,
the mother left, took off.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.020
She told my grandmother
when I was born,

10:25.020 --> 10:27.640
she said,
"If it's a boy,
I'm leaving."

10:27.640 --> 10:30.470
And actually,
I was a boy, you know.

10:30.470 --> 10:33.220
If you have that poverty
and miserableness

10:33.220 --> 10:36.140
and broken-heartedness
and alcohol and drugs,

10:36.140 --> 10:40.180
that makes for...
for a great songwriter.

10:40.180 --> 10:43.180
Mike:
Well, that brings us
to the drugs, I guess,

10:43.180 --> 10:47.060
which really got serious
after Billy Joe decided
to leave home for good.

10:47.060 --> 10:51.390
He's got to make a move
out of Texas at some point
and really go pursue this.

10:51.390 --> 10:55.220
So he's gonna go to LA.
He's trying to hitchhike.

10:55.220 --> 10:58.060
He's standing
out there for hours
and not getting a ride.

10:58.060 --> 11:00.350
And he went,
"Well, fuck it," you know.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.390
And he goes
to the other side
of the highway...

11:02.390 --> 11:05.680
and hitchhikes,
and ends up in Nashville.

11:07.730 --> 11:10.020
Bill Joe was not a boozehound,

11:10.020 --> 11:13.100
but he knew his way
around drugs.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.430
It was pills back then, uppers.

11:15.430 --> 11:18.310
Basically, the same thing
Johnny Cash had.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.930
Mike:
Singer Bobby Bare
met Billy Joe

11:20.930 --> 11:23.020
in the country music capital
of the world.

11:23.020 --> 11:25.310
He'd just started up
a publishing company.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.470
He came in my office
one morning on Music Row,

11:28.470 --> 11:29.890
sang me a few songs,

11:29.890 --> 11:32.520
and... the songs were strange.

11:32.520 --> 11:36.140

and a bottle of gin ♪
Billy Joe was stranger.

11:36.140 --> 11:37.560

of a different... ♪

11:37.560 --> 11:40.600

11:54.140 --> 11:56.560
When I first got to town,
I didn't have nowhere to stay,

11:56.560 --> 11:58.270
didn't have no car, nothing.

11:58.270 --> 12:02.600
Mike: He landed
on the couch of another
songwriter named Hal Bynum,

12:02.600 --> 12:06.390
known for the Kenny Rogers hit,
"Lucille," among other things.

12:06.390 --> 12:10.520
Hal was a fighter,
and I got in a lot
of fights, you know.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.220
Hal would come in at night,
usually, I'd be asleep.

12:14.220 --> 12:15.980
I'd feel something
on my neck,

12:15.980 --> 12:18.430
and it'd be
a dang rusty knife,

12:18.430 --> 12:21.310
and he would read
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

12:21.310 --> 12:23.470
(deep voice)
"Into the Valley of Death

12:23.470 --> 12:26.100
rode the six hundred."

12:26.100 --> 12:28.430
It sounded like something
Hal would do.

12:28.430 --> 12:31.730
I told Bobby about it.
I said, "I don't know
what's the matter with me.

12:31.730 --> 12:34.810
I don't know
why I didn't leave.
I guess I liked the poetry."

12:34.810 --> 12:38.060
He said, "No, I think
you liked the knife."
(laughs)

12:38.060 --> 12:39.850
Hal never used the knife.

12:39.850 --> 12:42.310
He doesn't have
that kind of courage.

12:42.310 --> 12:45.020
Mike:
Billy Joe was the one
who was fearless,

12:45.020 --> 12:47.680
particularly when it came
to experimentation.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.350
I've heard the stories
about Willie and Waylon

12:50.350 --> 12:52.560
testing, uh, dope on Billy Joe.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.350
I was kind of a guinea pig,
but I got a lot of free drugs.

12:56.350 --> 12:58.020
He'd take a handful of pills,

12:58.020 --> 13:01.520
and they'd sit back
and watch him for an hour,

13:01.520 --> 13:03.220
see how it affected him.

13:03.220 --> 13:06.180
I got a lot of cocaine
from Waylon.

13:06.180 --> 13:09.680
And Willie,
he wouldn't do nothing
but smoke marijuana.

13:09.680 --> 13:15.220
And, uh, Waylon would
fire you if he smelt
marijuana around you.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.220
And, uh,
Willie would fire you

13:17.220 --> 13:19.470
if he heard
you were doing coke.

13:19.470 --> 13:21.560
Mike:
Both Willie
and Waylon Jennings

13:21.560 --> 13:23.850
were instrumental
in Billy Joe's career,

13:23.850 --> 13:27.890
but his big break
came in a roundabout way
from the Grateful Dead.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.520
I went into Austin,
and I was supposed to play

13:31.520 --> 13:33.520
in front of the Grateful Dead,

13:33.520 --> 13:36.850
and I actually got there
a day late.

13:36.850 --> 13:40.180
And I'm walking off
across the parking lot,

13:40.180 --> 13:42.390
and the manager,
he comes hollering at me,

13:42.390 --> 13:45.350
say, "Hey, Billy, uh,
the Dead left you something."

13:45.350 --> 13:47.060
And he come out with his...

13:47.060 --> 13:48.470
purse-like thing--

13:48.470 --> 13:50.060
you know,
a man purse...

13:50.060 --> 13:54.140
(chuckles)
...and he had a big roll
of toilet paper.

13:54.140 --> 13:56.270
(laughs)
And I said,
"What are you trying--

13:56.270 --> 13:58.430
they trying to tell me
something or what?"

13:58.430 --> 13:59.560
And he said, "No."

13:59.560 --> 14:01.980
He said,
"There's a hit of Owsley acid

14:01.980 --> 14:03.730
on every square."

14:03.730 --> 14:07.100
Mike:
Owsley acid was
the street name for LSD,

14:07.100 --> 14:09.140
nicknamed for Owsley Stanley,

14:09.140 --> 14:11.430
the chemist who
was also known as Bear,

14:11.430 --> 14:14.640
who just happened to be
the Grateful Dead's sound man.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.680
Anyway, went and took a hit.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.640
♪ ♪

14:18.640 --> 14:21.770
And later that night,
I'm all, "Whoa, man."

14:21.770 --> 14:23.770
I'm seeing all kind of things.

14:24.810 --> 14:27.390
I got to laying down
on the cement.

14:27.390 --> 14:28.930
I woke up and this--

14:28.930 --> 14:33.560
this darn
brown recluse spider
had bit my arm.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.390
He laid there
all night long, I guess,

14:35.390 --> 14:39.140
just having a great time,
biting the hell out of me.

14:39.140 --> 14:42.180
And I remember
pushing it off,
and it was dead.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.310
Mike:
The year was 1972.

14:44.310 --> 14:47.100
It was the weekend
of the Dripping
Springs Reunion,

14:47.100 --> 14:49.390
the live music event
that would become

14:49.390 --> 14:52.310
Willie Nelson's
annual 4th of July picnic.

14:52.310 --> 14:55.390
It was totally disorganized,
but it was a great lineup,

14:55.390 --> 14:58.020
and it was in the middle
of nowhere in Texas.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.890
It's hotter than hell,
cowboys and hippies

15:00.890 --> 15:03.810
and girls throwing
their blouses on stage.

15:03.810 --> 15:06.930
From what I understand,
Billy Joe was gonna
play the picnic,

15:06.930 --> 15:10.810
but he kind of disappeared
out into the wilderness
for two or three days.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.270
I got to thinking
I was Jesus Christ,

15:13.270 --> 15:17.060
and I was gonna like,
uh, heal people and stuff.

15:17.060 --> 15:23.100
I went wandering around,
and I finally found this
little peanut truck--

15:23.100 --> 15:26.270
not a truck,
a peanut trailer.

15:26.270 --> 15:29.520
And it don't look like
you can get in 'em,
but you can.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.310
And I got inside there,

15:31.310 --> 15:35.140
and there was three guys
passing a guitar around.

15:35.140 --> 15:38.350
And I started playing
"Willy the Wandering Gypsy
and Me,"

15:38.350 --> 15:40.020
and all of a sudden
here comes somebody

15:40.020 --> 15:43.430
busting out of the back,
all bent over,

15:43.430 --> 15:45.430
and it was Waylon Jennings.

15:45.430 --> 15:48.520
And he says,
"Whose song is that?"

15:48.520 --> 15:50.350
And I said, "It's mine."

15:50.350 --> 15:53.520
He said, "You got any more
of those cowboy songs?"

15:53.520 --> 15:56.520
Billy Joe finally sucked,
fucked or cajoled Waylon

15:56.520 --> 15:59.220
into recording
a whole record of his songs,

15:59.220 --> 16:01.930
which turned out
to be Honky Tonk Heroes.

16:01.930 --> 16:05.390
What Billy Joe did not do,
was he would not leave
the studio

16:05.390 --> 16:08.020
when Waylon was recording,
and no artist appreciates

16:08.020 --> 16:11.390
a songwriter critiquing
every fucking thing he does.

16:11.390 --> 16:14.560
Waylon gave Captain Midnight
a hundred dollar bill

16:14.560 --> 16:16.100
and said,
"Give this to Billy Joe,

16:16.100 --> 16:19.430
and tell him to get
the fuck out of here
and stay away."

16:19.430 --> 16:21.980
And, uh, Billy Joe
threw it back at Midnight,

16:21.980 --> 16:25.140
and he said,
"You tell Waylon
to stick this up his ass."

Honky Tonk Heroes

16:45.640 --> 16:48.180
A lot of folks say
it was the Outlaw Movement's

16:48.180 --> 16:51.770
first true record
and maybe Waylon's best.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.930
Record company was happy,

16:53.930 --> 16:57.680
and Waylon's career
went... skyrocketing.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.270
Mike:
As for Billy Joe,
he went back on the road

17:00.270 --> 17:04.350
with Old Blue and the band,
playing songs for anyone
who would listen.

17:04.350 --> 17:06.810
And he went back to Texas,
where he had family,

17:06.810 --> 17:10.310
which brings us
to Billy Joe's relationship
to women,

17:10.310 --> 17:12.930
fertile ground
for any songwriter.

17:12.930 --> 17:15.640
He married his first wife,
Brenda, three times

17:15.640 --> 17:17.600
with divorces in between,

17:17.600 --> 17:21.560
and then he did the same thing
with wife number two, Wanda.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.020
She was my triple-ex-wife.

17:23.020 --> 17:24.560
She could drink
more than I could.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.100
That's why
I married her, really.

17:26.100 --> 17:29.810
Mike:
The last ceremony was held,
fittingly, in Las Vegas.

17:29.810 --> 17:33.390
And Billy Gibbons was, uh--
he married us.

17:33.390 --> 17:36.020
You know,
the guitar player
for ZZ Top?

17:36.020 --> 17:38.140
He's an ordained minister.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.730
Flew from Texas to Vegas,

17:39.730 --> 17:41.470
made it in about
an hour and a half.

17:41.470 --> 17:44.060
We arrived at the Chapel
of the West.

17:44.060 --> 17:48.140
Billy Joe walked in,
and I said, uh, "Gee, man,

17:48.140 --> 17:53.220
I'm really kind of excited.
This is kind of a big deal."

17:53.220 --> 17:55.890
And he said,
"Oh, don't think
anything of it.

17:55.890 --> 17:58.220
I've done it many times."
(laughs)

17:58.220 --> 18:00.810
Mike:
Six times, to put
a number on it.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.680
We wound up
going back to the hotel.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.020
I said, uh,
"Where's the celebration?"

18:05.020 --> 18:07.930
They said, uh,
"Oh, it's right there."

18:07.930 --> 18:10.730
And they were pointing
to the center of the casino.

18:10.730 --> 18:13.850
I said,
"Well, where's Billy Joe?"

18:13.850 --> 18:16.430
"You can see 'em.
They're right down there
on the floor."

18:16.430 --> 18:19.270
I said, "Well,
what are they doing?"

18:19.270 --> 18:22.020
They're down there
on the floor,

18:22.020 --> 18:24.430
in the main bar,
in the center of the casino.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.850
They're Indian leg wrestling.

18:26.850 --> 18:29.100
You've seen
that Indian wrestling thing.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.850
Everybody knows about that.

18:30.850 --> 18:32.470
And I looked down, I said,

18:32.470 --> 18:35.180
"Well, there's a one,
and then two,

18:35.180 --> 18:37.180
and then on three, wham."
(cracks)

18:38.180 --> 18:39.640
He popped my neck real good.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.350
Down the road we went
to the little walk-in clinic,

18:42.350 --> 18:44.850
and they said, "Gee,
uh, we better, uh--

18:44.850 --> 18:47.220
we better have a look at this."
So they did a quick X-ray.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.020
Well, he had broken his neck.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.310
(laughs)

18:50.310 --> 18:53.730
The guy that broke my neck,
he was my best man.

18:53.730 --> 18:57.140
Wanda got to crying so bad--
and she can cry.

18:57.140 --> 19:00.640
She has these tear ducts
that she has little plugs,

19:00.640 --> 19:04.680
and she took them things out,
mascara ran all down her face.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.140
It looked like somebody
just beat the hell out of her.

19:07.140 --> 19:10.680
She stayed out,
gone all night long,
you know.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.390
And I-- I assume
Billy consummated
the marriage.

19:14.390 --> 19:17.730
Mike:
Wanda and Billy Joe
headed back to Texas

19:17.730 --> 19:19.730
to get divorced, again.

19:19.730 --> 19:22.640
They stopped
at a watering hole,
close to home,

19:22.640 --> 19:24.390
named Papa Joe's.

19:24.390 --> 19:26.430
It's right
on the outskirts of Waco.

19:26.430 --> 19:27.890
It's just one of those places

19:27.890 --> 19:31.930
you're not gonna really
pull into if you got any sense.

19:31.930 --> 19:35.470
We go inside,
and here comes this guy,

19:35.470 --> 19:37.640
he's built like
a brick shit-house.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.560
And he comes over
there to our table,

19:39.560 --> 19:42.180
and then he got to stirring
the drinks with this here--

19:42.180 --> 19:44.770
one of them,
uh, Kershaw knives

19:44.770 --> 19:47.020
and kind of smarting off to me.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.430
And I noticed
my wife with her head
up against his head,

19:50.430 --> 19:53.270
and they're-- they're talking.
You know, they're close.

19:53.270 --> 19:56.560
But I didn't care.
We getting a divorce,
you understand?

19:56.560 --> 20:01.470
And it wasn't long
before I got tired of him
blabbering, you know.

20:01.470 --> 20:05.350
He turns around
and tells me, "Why don't
you shut the fuck up!"

20:05.350 --> 20:08.890
Well, I said,
"I can't take this."

20:08.890 --> 20:13.600
I said, "Look, man,
you gonna have to either
apologize or something."

20:13.600 --> 20:16.100
And then he--
he gets up out
of his chair.

20:16.100 --> 20:19.100
He said, "Apologize?
Hell, I'm gonna kill you."

20:19.100 --> 20:21.100
So we head
for the back door,

20:21.100 --> 20:24.390
and the leader of the band
handed him a gun.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.770
I said, "Oh shit,
what am I gonna do now?"

20:26.770 --> 20:30.850
I knew I'd--
I'd brought my little
.22 derringer with me,

20:30.850 --> 20:33.020
you know, just in case.

20:33.020 --> 20:34.810
He shot at me three times.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.060
Mike:
Let's stop right here
for a second.

20:39.060 --> 20:40.980
Witness accounts,
police records,

20:40.980 --> 20:42.980
and the legal arguments
presented in the case

20:42.980 --> 20:46.390
all depict the other man
as being armed with a knife.

20:46.390 --> 20:48.810
(zings)
Carry on.

20:48.810 --> 20:52.520
I knew it was time
to return fire.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.890
So, I actually come
out of my pocket

20:54.890 --> 20:56.980
with that little old thing
and went...

20:56.980 --> 20:59.020
(grunts)...
like that, just "Pfft!"

20:59.020 --> 21:02.890
And it hit him
right between the...
mother and the fucker.

21:02.890 --> 21:07.350
And he dropped his weapon,
and he said, "I'm sorry."

21:07.350 --> 21:09.470
And, uh, God, I wish
he'd have said that earlier

21:09.470 --> 21:11.270
and none of that
would have happened.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.180
Wanda comes hopping out
like a damn kangaroo,

21:14.180 --> 21:15.390
screaming and a-hollering,

21:15.390 --> 21:17.680
and she finally decided
to go with me,

21:17.680 --> 21:20.520
so we took off and went
to my, uh, hiding place,

21:20.520 --> 21:22.560
which I ain't
gonna tell you
where it is.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.850
Billy Joe called me
the night he was on the run.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.140
He was gonna get killed
or kill somebody.

21:29.140 --> 21:30.850
He said,
"I just shot this guy."

21:30.850 --> 21:33.730
I said, "Oh, fuck.
Is he dead?"

21:33.730 --> 21:35.810
He said,
"No, I just shot him
through the cheek."

21:35.810 --> 21:37.060
He said,
"What do I do?"

21:37.060 --> 21:39.180
Mike:
Word of the shootout
at Papa Joe's

21:39.180 --> 21:41.430
spread like wildfire
through his community.

21:41.430 --> 21:45.810
Phone rings,
and I flipped it over,
and it was Dale Watson.

21:45.810 --> 21:48.430
Mike:
Dale Watson is
a singer, guitarist,

21:48.430 --> 21:51.180
songwriter,
and good friend
of Billy Joe's.

21:51.180 --> 21:55.560
And Dale says,
"Billy, can I write
a song about this?"

21:55.560 --> 21:57.810
And I thought,
"What in the world?"

21:57.810 --> 21:59.930
I said, "Were you there?"
And he said, "No.

21:59.930 --> 22:01.640
I just wanna write
a song about it."

22:01.640 --> 22:04.430
And I said, "Well,
I guess so, you know."

22:04.430 --> 22:06.560
My phone rang. I picked it up,

22:06.560 --> 22:08.430
and it said "Billy Joe Shaver."

22:08.430 --> 22:11.310
Mike:
Connie Nelson was
Willie Nelson's third wife,

22:11.310 --> 22:14.810
and more importantly,
a close personal friend
to Billy Joe.

22:14.810 --> 22:18.430
And the first words he said was,
"Connie, I'm in big trouble."

22:18.430 --> 22:20.390
And I said,
"Oh, God, Billy Joe."

22:20.390 --> 22:22.770
I said, "Listen,
where's the gun now?"

22:22.770 --> 22:26.100
And he said,
"It's in my pocket."
And I said, "Oh, God."

22:26.100 --> 22:28.100
Mike:
Connie contacted a lawyer,

22:28.100 --> 22:31.600
and this lawyer
convinced Billy Joe
to turn himself in.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.730
He was released
on a $50,000 bond

22:34.730 --> 22:38.140
and managed
to play a gig later
that night in Austin.

22:38.140 --> 22:40.640
That's Billy Joe.
What are you gonna do?

22:40.640 --> 22:42.430
Fast-forward,
so they indict him,

22:42.430 --> 22:45.930
so there's this big trial
and media circus in Waco.

22:45.930 --> 22:48.980
By the time, I'd fired
about five different lawyers,

22:48.980 --> 22:50.930
'cause they all wanted me
to plead guilty.

22:50.930 --> 22:54.730
Mike:
He ended up with Texas
legal legend, Dick DeGuerin.

22:54.730 --> 22:57.640
Now, Dick DeGuerin is
a very good lawyer,

22:57.640 --> 22:59.560
if there is such a thing.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.850
Mike:
Among his many
infamous defendants,

23:01.850 --> 23:05.390
Dick DeGuerin has represented
former Congressman Tom DeLay

23:05.390 --> 23:07.600
and cult leader David Koresh.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.930
Dick DeGuerin
also represented
Bobby Durst,

23:11.930 --> 23:15.140
who, uh, cut
the guy's head off
in, uh, Waco.

23:15.140 --> 23:18.470
Bobby Durst and I were
co-best men

23:18.470 --> 23:21.810
at Chinga Chavin's
wedding in Las Vegas.

23:21.810 --> 23:23.640
Chinga Chavin,
the guy who wrote

23:23.640 --> 23:25.640
"Proud to Be an Asshole
from El Paso"

23:25.640 --> 23:30.430
and also "Cum Stains
On the Pillow (Where
Your Sweet Head Used to Be)."

23:30.430 --> 23:33.310
At any rate,
Dick DeGuerin, he says,

23:33.310 --> 23:35.220
"Never put a woman on a jury

23:35.220 --> 23:37.980
whose lips resemble
a chicken's asshole."

23:37.980 --> 23:39.100
(sniffs)

23:39.100 --> 23:41.140
And that's what
I was worried about in Waco.

23:41.140 --> 23:44.350
Billy Joe was a local boy
and very well known,

23:44.350 --> 23:46.020
so had standing room only

23:46.020 --> 23:47.430
in the courtroom.
(clears throat)

23:47.430 --> 23:49.180
And there were
Billy Joe supporters,

23:49.180 --> 23:53.390
for instance,
Robert Duvall came to the trial,

23:53.390 --> 23:54.680
Willie Nelson came,

23:54.680 --> 23:56.680
and, uh, he called me
on his cell phone.

23:56.680 --> 24:01.020
He said, "Now, Dick,
are you gonna put Billy Joe
on the stand?"

24:01.020 --> 24:04.390
I said, "Yeah,
Willie, I've got to.
He's got to testify."

24:04.390 --> 24:06.350
He said, "Well,
you know you can't trust

24:06.350 --> 24:07.810
"what comes out of his mouth.

24:07.810 --> 24:10.470
(chuckles)
You never can tell
what he's gonna say."

24:10.470 --> 24:13.350
For instance,
prosecutor said,
"Now, Mr. Shaver,

24:13.350 --> 24:16.730
you could've just walked away
from there, couldn't you?"

24:16.730 --> 24:20.640
He said, "Ma'am, I'm from Texas.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.100
I ain't no chickenshit."

24:22.100 --> 24:25.850
"Oh, you didn't just say that.
Oh, no, you didn't." (laughs)

24:25.850 --> 24:28.890
There was another point
in the trial where, again,

24:28.890 --> 24:30.470
Billy Joe's on the stand, this--

24:30.470 --> 24:33.390
and the prosecutor
was cross-examining.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.390
She's pointing that finger
at me and said,

24:35.390 --> 24:37.470
"You said,
'Where you want it?'"

24:37.470 --> 24:40.560
And I said, "What?"
I said, "I didn't say that."

24:40.560 --> 24:42.730
And they said,
"We know you did,

24:42.730 --> 24:44.730
because we heard it
on the radio."

24:44.730 --> 24:46.680
Mike:
Remember Dale Watson?

24:46.680 --> 24:51.060
Well, Billy Joe's
old friend had memorialized
the shootout in a song,

24:51.060 --> 24:53.060
which had been playing
on the radio.

24:53.060 --> 24:56.220
Dale:
♪ Billy ask him, "Son,
where do you want it?" ♪

24:56.220 --> 25:00.850
And just about this time,
I see the judge rolled his eyes,

25:00.850 --> 25:04.930
and I thought,
"He's gonna go to prison.
Oh, my God."

25:04.930 --> 25:07.680
Oh, yes. I was
just sitting there, cringing,

25:07.680 --> 25:10.100
'cause there's
nothing I could do.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.730
Mike:
After a three-day trial,

25:11.730 --> 25:14.430
the jury took just two hours
to reach a verdict.

25:14.430 --> 25:18.930
Dick:
Bill Joe was very nervous.
The judge says,

25:18.930 --> 25:22.850
"We, the jury,
find the defendant,

25:22.850 --> 25:25.930
Billy Joe Shaver,
not guilty."

25:25.930 --> 25:29.770
(cheering)
The courtroom
erupted in applause.

25:29.770 --> 25:32.770
For a guy who
makes millions of bucks
doing ridiculous cases

25:32.770 --> 25:36.060
for people who
are obviously guilty
and everybody knows it,

25:36.060 --> 25:39.100
that may have been
Dick DeGuerin's finest hour.

25:39.100 --> 25:42.600
Billy Joe's been quoted
as saying he wanted
his bullet back.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.060
(laughs)

25:44.060 --> 25:47.430
But the Lord blessed
Billy Joe and it ended well,

25:47.430 --> 25:51.180
and he got a song out of it,
"Wacko From Waco."

25:51.180 --> 25:53.930
Billy Joe:
♪ I'm wacko from Waco ♪

25:53.930 --> 25:55.890
♪ Ain't no doubt about it ♪

25:55.890 --> 25:58.140
♪ Shot a man there
in the mouth ♪

25:58.140 --> 26:00.020
♪ But can't talk
much about it... ♪

26:00.020 --> 26:02.810
Mike:
The "Wacko from Waco"
may live a charmed life,

26:02.810 --> 26:06.560
but he hasn't gotten away
scot-free. No one does.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.020
He lost one of his wives
to cancer,

26:09.020 --> 26:12.020
and his only son
to an overdose.

26:12.020 --> 26:15.470
Billy Joe himself suffered
a heart attack on stage,

26:15.470 --> 26:17.060
both knees have given out,

26:17.060 --> 26:19.730
and he's broken
his neck three times.

26:19.730 --> 26:22.100
Man, I'm a mess, you know,

26:22.100 --> 26:24.930
but I'm still writing songs.

26:24.930 --> 26:27.470
You know, you look
at guy who's a poet,

26:27.470 --> 26:29.310
that's a very high calling.

26:29.310 --> 26:32.020
Being a songwriter is to sail
as close to the truth

26:32.020 --> 26:35.020
as you can get
without sinking the ship.

26:35.020 --> 26:36.890
Or as Willie Nelson says,

26:36.890 --> 26:39.730
"If you fail
at something long enough,

26:39.730 --> 26:41.770
you become a legend."

26:41.770 --> 26:44.350
Billy Joe:

26:44.350 --> 26:46.850
♪ I'm gonna cross

26:46.850 --> 26:50.020

27:34.060 --> 27:36.560
(car engine revs)
