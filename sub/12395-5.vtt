DOUBLE-A PLAYER OF THE YEAR,

00:06.240 --> 00:07.696
CAL EASON.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.334

MANAGER MEL HORNSBY

00:10.370 --> 00:12.133
WANTS UP IN THIS SITUATION.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.171

NOT THAT YOURS IS THAT BAD.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.049
IT JUST WON'T WORK
WITH MY HEAD, YOU KNOW?

00:29.090 --> 00:33.424
AND I DEFINITELY WON'T GRAB
MY CROTCH SO MUCH DURING GAMES.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.449
IT'S WEIRD.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.388

01:51.840 --> 01:53.330
YOU NEED GLASSES.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.440
LAST WEEK YOU MISTOOK ME
FOR MICHAEL CHIKLIS.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.449
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE
DRESSED LIKE MICHAEL CHIKLIS.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.345
- FIRST OF THE MONTH
GUS AND I PLAY THE COMMISH.

02:01.380 --> 02:02.642
YOU KNOW THAT!

02:02.690 --> 02:04.442
- DON'T BLAME ME FOR YOUR
STUPID BASE RUNNING.

02:04.490 --> 02:06.617
EVEN IN SPORTS,
YOU GOT NO DISCIPLINE.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.412
- I WAS SAFE BY A YARD,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

02:08.460 --> 02:09.882
YOU CALLED ME OUT
'CAUSE YOU WERE JEALOUS.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.420
- JEALOUS?
JEALOUS OF WHAT?

02:11.460 --> 02:12.927

ANYTHING TRULY EMBARRASSING.

02:25.310 --> 02:26.504

- AGH!

02:32.650 --> 02:35.539
- PICK IT UP.

02:35.580 --> 02:36.683

02:45.290 --> 02:46.450

02:46.500 --> 02:49.765
- I BET YOU WOULD.
- THAT'S MESSED UP.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.222
- THAT WAS ONE HELL
OF A SWING.

02:51.270 --> 02:52.532
- MEL?

02:52.570 --> 02:54.231
- [chuckles]

02:54.270 --> 02:56.409
MEL.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.431
- LOOK AT YOU.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.904
MY FORMER BAT BOY
ALL GROWN UP.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.578
- GUS, IT GIVES ME
GREAT PLEASURE

03:02.610 --> 03:04.749
TO INTRODUCE MEL HORNSBY.

03:04.780 --> 03:05.747
MANAGER OF THE SEABIRDS.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.317
- OH, WOW, SOUNDS LIKE
THE COOLEST JOB EVER.

03:08.350 --> 03:09.419
- THE MINOR LEAGUE
BASEBALL TEAM,

03:09.450 --> 03:11.418
NOT THE ACCI)T|_LIJAL BIRDS.

03:11.450 --> 03:12.781
- SHAWN, THE REASON
WHY I'M HERE IS--

03:12.820 --> 03:14.458
- I KNOW, MEL,
I'M A PSYCHIC.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.458
YOU NEED ME
TO PLAY SHORTSTOP.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.685
- NO, I WANT YOU TO DO SOME
INVESTIGATIVE WORK FOR ME.

03:18.730 --> 03:20.288
- SLASH, PLAY SHORTSTOP.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.558
- NO, I DEFINITELY
DON'T NEED THAT.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.261
- LOOK, I'M WILLING
TO MOVE POSITIONS

03:23.300 --> 03:24.665
ONLY BECAUSE IT'S YOU,

03:24.700 --> 03:26.531
BUT I'D LIKE TO PICK
MY SPOT IN THE BATTING ORDER.

03:26.570 --> 03:28.299
- WHAT DO YOU NEED
INVESTIGATED?

03:28.340 --> 03:31.468
- MY LONGTIME HITTING COACH
GRADY BARRETT

03:31.510 --> 03:33.603
DROPPED DEAD THE OTHER DAY
OF A HEART ATTACK.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.505
- OH, NO.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.507
- WOW.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.347
- I'M SORRY, MEL.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.540
GRADY WAS A GOOD MAN.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.548
- YES, HE WAS.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.616
BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
TO THE STORY.

03:43.650 --> 03:47.518
THEY FOUND A LARGE AMOUNT
OF AMPHETAMINES IN HIS SYSTEM.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.448
GREENIES AS WE CALL THEM
IN THE BASEBALL WORLD.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.287
- YEAH.
- GREENIES?

03:51.330 --> 03:52.820
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE GRADY.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.522
SO YOU THINK SOMEONE
ON THE TEAM

03:55.560 --> 03:57.460
SLIPPED HIM DRUGS
AND MURDERED HIM?

03:57.500 --> 03:58.626
- PERHAPS.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.594
WHATEVER HAPPENED,
I JUST NEED TO KNOW.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.335
THE MAN WAS LIKE
A BROTHER TO ME.

04:03.370 --> 04:05.008
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
WE'LL HELP YOU, MEL.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.474
BUT IN ORDER FOR ME
TO INVESTIGATE PROPERLY,

04:07.510 --> 04:08.704
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GET ON THE INSIDE.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.948
I MEAN, DEEP ON THE INSIDE.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.470
- I'M NOT MAKING YOU
MY SHORTSTOP.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.509

04:16.620 --> 04:18.815
LEFTY SITUATIONAL RELIEVER?

04:18.850 --> 04:20.750
- YOU'RE RIGHT-HANDED, SHAWN.
- HERE'S THE THING.

04:20.790 --> 04:23.020
WHEN I GET HIRED BY
A PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FRANCHISE,

04:23.060 --> 04:25.324
IT IS CUSTOMARY
THAT I GO UNDERCOVER

04:25.360 --> 04:26.588
AS ONE OF THE PLAYERS.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.427
- WHAT IF I MAKE YOU A COACH?

04:28.460 --> 04:30.724
I COULD SAY YOU'RE
MY ROVING HITTING INSTRUCTOR

04:30.770 --> 04:32.931
UNTIL THE ORGANIZATION
FINDS A NEW ONE.

04:32.970 --> 04:36.064
- I CAN ROVE.
I FEEL LIKE I CAN ROVE.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.636
AND THEN I'LL GET TO WORK
WITH CAL EASON AGAIN.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.035
- THAT'S RIGHT.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.571
IT'S AMAZING,

04:40.610 --> 04:42.544
AFTER 20 YEARS HE'S
RIGHT BACK WHERE HE STARTED.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.070
POOR GUY.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.998
- WE'LL NEED TO FIND SOMETHING
FOR MY PARTNER GUS HERE.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.517
WE'RE A PACKAGE DEAL.

04:47.550 --> 04:50.314

POSITION AVAILABLE.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME, MAN?

05:06.600 --> 05:07.532
YOU'RE KILLING IT UP THERE.

GET TO THE MAJORS!

DIE WITH DRUGS IN THEIR SYSTEM

08:32.810 --> 08:33.902
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE, MAN.

08:33.940 --> 08:35.237
IF THERE WERE GREENIES
IN THIS HOUSE,

08:35.280 --> 08:36.770
I THINK WE WOULD'VE FOUND THEM
BY NOW.

08:36.810 --> 08:38.903
- DUDE, NOT NECESSARILY.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.748
- [counting rapidly]
20.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.247
[counting rapidly]
30.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.780
- SHAWN.
- WHAT?

08:49.090 --> 08:50.318
- I HAD A FRIEND OF MINE
AT THE LAB

08:50.360 --> 08:51.782
RUN A QUICK TEST ON THE WATER,

08:51.830 --> 08:53.923
AND IT IS, IN FACT, LACED
WITH AMPHETAMINES.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.791
NOW, WHAT MADE YOU SUSPECT THIS,
BY THE WAY?

08:55.830 --> 09:00.267
- [rapidly]
47, 48, 49, 50, 51!

09:00.300 --> 09:01.836
- OH, NO.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.565
- HE MEMORIZED THE ENTIRE
OWNER'S MANUAL TO MY CAR

09:03.610 --> 09:04.565
ON THE WAY OVER HERE.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.634
- HEY, JULES.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.568
DID YOU KNOW
THAT THE TOYOTA ECHO

09:06.610 --> 09:08.805
HAS A 1.5-LITER INLINE
4-CYLINDER ENGINE

09:08.840 --> 09:10.649
WITH MULTI-LOCKING BRAKES?

09:10.680 --> 09:11.942
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH SHAWN?

09:11.980 --> 09:13.845
- HE ACCIDENTALLY
INGESTED SPEED.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.279
- OKAY.
ARE YOU WORKING ON ANYTHING

09:15.320 --> 09:17.049
WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED WITH?
- NOT YET.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.341
- GOOD.
- HEY.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.948
IT'S THE BALD, BLIND UMPIRE
OF SANTA BARBARA.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.584
- YOU WERE OUT BY A FOOT.
- COME ON, YOU TWO.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.656
SHAWN, I THINK WE SHOULD TELL
MEL HORNSBY ABOUT THE BOTTLE.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.726
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
THAT'S WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR?

09:27.760 --> 09:29.057
- YEP. HE HIRED ME
TO INVESTIGATE

09:29.100 --> 09:30.294
THE TRAGIC DEATH
OF GRADY BARRETT,

09:30.330 --> 09:31.820
AND HE MADE ME A COACH.
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

09:31.870 --> 09:32.837
WHY DIDN'T HE CONTACT ME?

09:32.870 --> 09:34.792
I'VE BEEN A SEASON-TICKET HOLDER
FOR 15 YEARS.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.137
- PROBABLY BECAUSE
HE WANTED SOMEBODY GOOD,

09:36.170 --> 09:37.660
THOUGH I'M SURE HE APPRECIATES
THE 40 BUCKS

09:37.710 --> 09:38.938
YOU SHELL OUT
FOR THOSE TICKETS ANNUALLY.

09:38.970 --> 09:40.801
- SHAWN, ENOUGH.
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.308
- BUDDY, I'M NOT SURE
I'M CAPABLE OF ANYTHING ELSE.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.238
I'M LOCKED IN
ON YOUR EAR AGAIN.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.508
- SHAWN, LISTEN,
I THINK MEL WAS RIGHT

09:46.550 --> 09:49.644
ABOUT SOMEBODY SLIPPING GRADY
GREENIES WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.783
- I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT, GUS.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.117
DAD, WHO WEARS NUMBER 42?

09:53.160 --> 09:55.981
- IZZY JACKSON,
ORGANIZATION'S TOP PROSPECT.

09:56.020 --> 09:57.988
HE SIGNED A MASSIVE CONTRACT
LAST YEAR.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.089
- SWEET. LET'S GO.
- TO WHERE?

10:00.130 --> 10:01.859
- HOW LONG UNTIL THE STUFF
WEARS OFF?

10:01.900 --> 10:03.822
- HOPEFULLY
IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.018
[clicks tongue]
SHAWN, WAKE UP.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.870
- [gaSPSJ
WHERE ARE WE?

10:21.920 --> 10:23.342
- AT THE ADDRESS
YOU TOLD ME TO DRIVE TO

10:23.390 --> 10:26.188
RIGHT BEFORE YOU PASSED OUT.
- OH, MAN.

10:26.220 --> 10:29.849
THOSE THINGS WILL REALLY SLAP
YOU ON THE WAY DOWN.

10:29.890 --> 10:33.348
- WHY ARE WE AT A BAR?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.356
- [sighs]
IT'S NOT JUST ANY BAR, GUS.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.368
IT'S THE FAVORITE HANGOUT
OF THE SEABIRDS.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.890
- FOR REAL?
WHERE?

10:38.930 --> 10:40.898
- THE TEAM.
- OH.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.363
WHY DO I KEEP DOING THAT?
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE A FOOL.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.368
BY THE WAY, THESE GUYS
HAVE REALLY TAKEN TO ME.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.731
I MEAN, THEY REALLY LOVE ME,
FOR SERIOUS.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.806
RICKY, GOOD GAME TODAY, MAN.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.375
- HEY, THANKS, TOWEL BOY.
- [chuckles]

10:54.420 --> 10:55.739
YOU SEE?

10:55.780 --> 10:57.384
WE'RE JUST LIKE A FAMILY.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.911
THIS IS WHERE I'M BETTING
WE'LL FIND IZZY JACKSON,

10:59.960 --> 11:02.053
THE, UH, ACTUAL OWNER
OF THAT WATER BOTTLE.

11:02.090 --> 11:04.229
- SO HE KILLED GRADY?
- YEAH.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.921
BUT NOT NECESSARILY
ON PURPOSE.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.257
HE HAD A HITTING SESSION
WITH GRADY

11:07.300 --> 11:08.927
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
BEFORE HE DIED.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.962
THIS IS WHAT I THINK HAPPENED.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.764
IZZY'S POPPING GREENIES
TO IMPROVE HIS PERFORMANCE.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.791
THEY GET THEIR BOTTLES MIXED UP
DURING THE SESSION.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.764
GRADY GOES HOME WITH THE WRONG
BOTTLE, TAKES A FEW MORE SWIGS.

11:18.810 --> 11:21.335
HIS OLD HEART JUST--
JUST GIVES OUT ON HIM.

11:23.880 --> 11:24.972
- WAIT A SECOND.

11:25.010 --> 11:27.979
IZZY'S TAKING GREENIES?
DON'T THEY TEST FOR THAT STUFF?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.238
- YEAH, BUT IT'S PRETTY EASY
TO GET AROUND THOSE TESTS.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.087
- HOW?
- I COULD PASS ONE TOMORROW

11:32.120 --> 11:34.259
BY SIMPLY TAKING SOME
OF YOUR URINE,

11:34.290 --> 11:37.259
PUTTING IT IN A CUP,
SWAPPING IT OUT WITH MY URINE.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.952
- I WOULD NOT LET YOU
TOUCH MY URINE.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.422
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE FRIEND
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.927
- [scoffs]
WELL...

11:42.970 --> 11:44.790
SO WHAT'S OUR PLAN?
- SIMPLE--

11:44.830 --> 11:47.958
WE APPROACH IZZY, GET HIM
TO ADMIT TO POPPING GREENIES.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.809
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND
SIMPLE, SHAWN.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.809
GUS, DON'T BE
PETE ROSE'S HAIRCUT.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.102
IZZY!

11:54.140 --> 11:56.404
[chuckles]
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.044
WHAT IS UP?

11:58.080 --> 11:59.240
SHAWN SPENCER.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.976
YEAH, WE MET EARLIER TODAY.
I'M YOUR NEW HITTING COACH.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.442
- REALLY?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE, UM--

12:03.490 --> 12:04.809
- NEW SHORTSTOP?
NO.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.909
- TOWEL BOY, ACTUALLY.
- OH.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.259
- HEY, YOU'RE
THE NEW MASCOT, RIGHT?

12:10.290 --> 12:12.281
YOU DO A KILLER WORM.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.059
UGH, UGH.
[girl laughs]

12:14.100 --> 12:15.920
- I ACTUALLY HAD AN ITCH.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.962
- LISTEN, SHAWN,
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,

12:18.000 --> 12:19.991
BUT, UH, I'M ON A BIT
OF A HOT STREAK OF LATE,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.463
AND I DON'T WANT YOU COMING IN
AND MESSING WITH MY SWING,

12:22.500 --> 12:24.468
BECAUSE I HAVE A TENDENCY
TO OVERTHINK THINGS.

12:24.510 --> 12:27.832
- AH, THAT SURPRISES ME,
BUT DOESN'T MATTER,

12:27.880 --> 12:30.041
'CAUSE IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
DON'T FIX IT, AM I RIGHT?

12:30.080 --> 12:32.139
YEAH. BESIDES,
YOU LOOK SO FOCUSED

12:32.180 --> 12:33.317
AT THE PLATE THESE DAYS--

12:33.350 --> 12:36.444
I MEAN, JUST REALLY,
REALLY FOCUSED.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.038
- WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.114
- NOTHING, MAN...

12:39.150 --> 12:40.981
THOUGH IF YOU WERE GETTING
A LITTLE EXTRA SOMETHING

12:41.020 --> 12:43.955
FROM, UH, UNCLE GREENIE,

12:43.990 --> 12:45.287
I WOULDN'T BE MAD AT THAT.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.059
LORD KNOWS I USED THEM
WHEN I WAS PLAYING.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.250
- YEAH, I NEVER TOUCHED
THAT STUFF, AND I NEVER WILL.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.165
- WELL, I CAN RESPECT THAT.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.929
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.494
- OH, COME ON, IZZY, THE PARTY'S
JUST GETTING STARTED.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.167
- NO, I SAID IT'S OVER.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.360
- HEY.
HEY, HEY.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.162
HEY, SETTLE DOWN, IZZY, HUH?
TAKE IT EASY.

12:59.210 --> 13:00.507
- HEY.
IT'S ALL GOOD, CAL.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.007
- HEY, BARTENDER, LET'S GET
ANOTHER ROUND OF DRINKS

13:02.040 --> 13:03.348
FOR THIS MAN
ON ME, ALL RIGHT?

13:03.380 --> 13:05.348
- [chuckles] THIS GUY.
- SHAWN...

13:05.380 --> 13:06.540
- LET'S GET OUR DRINK ON!

13:06.580 --> 13:08.445
- WHOO!
- THIS GUY.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.038
YEAH !

13:10.090 --> 13:11.409
WHOO-HOO-HOO!
- [hiccups]

13:11.450 --> 13:13.350
- IT'S NEVER WISE TO MESS
WITH A DRUNK IDIOT, SHAWN.

13:13.390 --> 13:14.379
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT, HUH?

13:14.420 --> 13:16.957
- OH, MAN, ARE YOU A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES, CAL.

13:16.990 --> 13:20.027
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE BACK
HERE PLAYING FOR THE SEABIRDS.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.357
- YEAH, NOR CAN I.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.368
AFTER THE RANGERS CUT ME,

13:23.400 --> 13:26.369
IT WAS EITHER SIGN UP HERE
OR GET SOME LOUSY JOB

13:26.400 --> 13:27.594
LIKE SELLING PHARMACEUTICALS.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.234
- THAT'S A NO'IBWM PROFESSION.

13:30.270 --> 13:31.862
- YOU LOOK GOOD, MAN,
REAL GOOD.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.104
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

13:33.140 --> 13:35.176
I'VE BEEN A FAN,
A BIG FAN OVER THE YEARS.

13:35.210 --> 13:37.371
- WELL, LISTEN, I APPRECIATE YOU
BEING SUCH A BIG FAN AND ALL,

13:37.410 --> 13:39.207
BUT I'M NOT SURE
I'M WORTHY OF IT,

13:39.250 --> 13:41.115
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CAREER
I'VE HAD.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.913
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:42.950 --> 13:44.918
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOUR KNEES,

13:44.950 --> 13:46.986
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
A PERENNIAL ALL-STAR.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.921
I MEAN, YOU HIT OVER .300
ALL FOUR YEARS IN BALTIMORE.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.929
YOUR 36.2 PERCENTAGE
FOR THROWING OUT BASE RUNNERS

13:52.960 --> 13:54.359
WAS ONE OF THE BEST
OF YOUR ERA.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.856
- YOU REALLY ARE A FAN, HUH?

13:55.900 --> 13:57.925
- I GOT TO TELL YOU, MAN,

13:57.970 --> 14:00.564
I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO GET BACK
IN THE BIG LEAGUES.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.966
I JUST FEEL LIKE I GOT SOMETHING
LEI-T IN THE TANK, YOU KNOW?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.409
- YOU BET YOUR BUTT YOU DO.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.169
I'M GONNA HELP YOU
GET BACK, CAL.

14:06.210 --> 14:07.939
- UH, YOU ARE NOT
A REAL COACH.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.070
MAN, YOU WILL BE CATCHING AGAIN
IN THE BIGS IN NO TIME.

14:12.110 --> 14:14.078
- WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR ENTHUSIASM, SHAWN,

14:14.120 --> 14:17.248
BUT IF IT IS GONNA HAPPEN,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE AS A CATCHER.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.246
MY KNEES
CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

14:19.290 --> 14:21.588
WHAT I GOT TO DO IS I GOT
TO TRANSITION TO FIRST BASE,

14:21.620 --> 14:25.056
BUT I GOT THAT DRUNK MORON
AHEAD OF ME.

14:25.090 --> 14:28.093
- [silly voice]
NOW BATTING, IZZY JACKSON!

14:28.130 --> 14:29.961
- WOW.
THAT'S ACTUALLY IMPRESSIVE.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.228
- IT'S DISGUSTING.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.329
- YEAH, MEL WANTS ME TO WHIP HIM
INTO SHAPE, BUT I DON'T KNOW.

14:33.370 --> 14:35.634
[sighs]
- CARE TO DANCE?

14:37.270 --> 14:38.908
- I WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO.

14:38.940 --> 14:42.103
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

14:42.140 --> 14:45.246
- [sighs]
COULD HE BE ANY MORE AWESOME?

14:45.280 --> 14:48.340
SHAWN, HOW ARE WE GONNA PROVE
THAT IZZY'S TAKING GREENIES?

14:48.380 --> 14:51.110
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN. THERE'S GOT
TO BE A WAY TO TEST THIS GUY.

14:51.150 --> 14:52.981
- IZZY,
WE GOT A GAME TOMORROW.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.215
- MM.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.181
- IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE,

14:56.220 --> 14:58.085
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
WHIZZING YOURSELF AGAIN.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.324
[Izzy belches]

14:59.360 --> 15:01.499
- HEY, DRUNK...
- NO.

15:01.530 --> 15:04.294
- YES. YES. YES. YES.
- NO. NO. NO. NO, SHAWN.

15:04.330 --> 15:07.128
- AH, EXCUSE ME?

15:07.170 --> 15:10.298
ANOTHER ROUND OF DRINKS
FOR MY BOY IZZY THERE

15:10.340 --> 15:11.637
AND SOME SHOTS.

15:11.670 --> 15:14.173
UH, KEEP IT COMING
ALL NIGHT LONG.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.178
BIG NIGHT FOR HIM.
THANK YOU.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.518
WHIZZY.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.278
- [groans]

15:29.520 --> 15:33.195
[groans]

15:33.230 --> 15:35.027
NOT AGAIN.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.164
- STEALING THE PANTS
OFF A DRUNK GUY

15:37.200 --> 15:39.020
FOR A URINE SAMPLE--
REALLY, SHAWN?

15:39.070 --> 15:40.332
- HEY, HEY, HEY, LOOK,
FOR THE RECORD,

15:40.370 --> 15:42.167
HE REMOVED THEM HIMSELF, OKAY?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.668
I JUST HOOKED THEM WITH A STICK
AND THEN RAN OFF

15:44.710 --> 15:46.166
AS HE TRIED TO SET GUS
ON FIRE.

15:46.210 --> 15:48.178
THAT GUY PARTIES HARD.
- THINK QUICK, TOWEL BOY.

15:48.210 --> 15:49.336
- HEY!

15:49.380 --> 15:51.746
I AM YOUR COACH.
I AM NOT THE TOWEL BOY.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.338
I HAVE MY OWN WINDBREAKER.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.177
- YEAH, WELL,
IT WAS A HAREBRAINED IDEA,

15:55.220 --> 15:56.448
BUT SHOCKINGLY, IT WORKED.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.553
THE LAB WAS ABLE TO RUN A TEST
ON THE URINE FOUND ON THE JEANS.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.683
- NICE. AND?

16:02.720 --> 16:06.224
- UH, THE GUY HAD
A BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL OF .29.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.022
HE WAS LOADED.

16:07.060 --> 16:10.325
- OKAY.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT GREENIES?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.065
- NO, NOTHING.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.364
[loud thud]

16:14.400 --> 16:16.595
- WHERE'S JACKSON?

16:16.640 --> 16:18.528
- SORRY.
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM, MEL.

16:18.570 --> 16:21.232
- SHAWN, IF IZZY WASN'T TAKING
THE PILLS HIMSELF,

16:21.280 --> 16:23.771
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO CONSIDER THAT
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL GRADY.

16:23.810 --> 16:25.209
- DAMN PRIMA DONNA.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.070
EASON?
- YEAH.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.680
- YOU'RE STARTING TONIGHT--
FIRST BASE.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.012
- ALL RIGHT.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.709
- THERE'S
ONE MORE POSSIBILITY.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.228
[whispering] IF IZZY TESTED
POSITIVE FOR AM PH ETAMINES,

16:37.260 --> 16:39.228
HOW LONG
WOULD HE BE SUSPENDED?

16:39.260 --> 16:42.491
- UH, FIRST OFFENSE,
3O GAMES. WHY?

16:44.530 --> 16:46.566
- WHAT I NEED TO DO
IS TRANSITION TO FIRST BASE,

16:46.600 --> 16:49.535
BUT I GOT THAT DRUNK MORON
AHEAD OF ME.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.401
I GOT TO TELL YOU, MAN,
I WOULD DO ANYTHING

16:51.440 --> 16:53.601
TO GET ONE MORE SHOT
AT THE BIG LEAGUES.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.743
- LAST NIGHT YOU SAID,
"LET'S STEAL THESE GUYS' PANTS,

17:05.790 --> 17:08.088
AND THE INVESTIGATION
WILL BE OVER."

17:08.120 --> 17:10.088
- JUST FOR THE RECORD,
USUALLY WHEN I SAY THAT,

17:10.130 --> 17:11.586
IT TURNS OUT TO BE
THE CASE, OKAY?

17:11.630 --> 17:13.257
I JUST NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME.
- FOR WHAT?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.097
- TO PROVE THAT THE DRUGS
THAT KILLED GRADY

17:15.130 --> 17:17.098
WERE PLACED THERE BY CAL.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.427
- I KNOW.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.131
HE'S TRYING TO GET
IZZY SUSPENDED

17:20.170 --> 17:22.092
SO THEY CAN TAKE
HIS PLAYING TIME.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.438
DOESN'T THAT SUCK?
THE MAN USED TO BE MY IDOL.

17:24.470 --> 17:25.334
- YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY SUCKS?

17:25.370 --> 17:27.099
BEING A CLASSICALLY TRAINED
TAP DANCER

17:27.140 --> 17:29.131
THAT'S BEING FORCED TO DANCE
THE MACARENA

17:29.180 --> 17:30.602
IN FRONT OF A BUNCH
OF LIQUORED-UP TOWNIES

17:30.650 --> 17:32.277
WHILE WEARING
A FLEA-INFESTED SEABIRD SUIT.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.141
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
CLASSICALLY TRAINED IN ANYTHING?

17:34.180 --> 17:35.442
- THIS I THE LAST GAME
THAT I'M DOING, SHAWN.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.118
AND IF THESE FOLKS
WANT THE MACARENA,

17:37.150 --> 17:40.517
THEY'RE FRESH OUT OF LUCK.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.087
[crack of bat]
- [sighs]

17:48.160 --> 17:49.559
SAY IT AIN'T SO, CAL.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.761
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:51.800 --> 17:54.337
- MAN, I BELIEVED IN YOU.
- [grunts]

17:54.370 --> 17:55.689
YOU BELIEVED IN ME?

17:55.740 --> 17:58.629
- THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE
I BELIEVE IN A LOT OF THINGS.

17:58.670 --> 18:00.376
I BELIEVE
IN FRESH TENNIS BALLS,

18:00.410 --> 18:01.877
THE HEALING POWER OF BUNNIES,

18:01.910 --> 18:03.548
AND THAT THE NOVELS
OF SUSAN SONTAG

18:03.580 --> 18:04.877
ARE SOMETHING I'LL NEVER READ.

18:04.910 --> 18:07.640
IN FACT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO SUSAN SONTAG IS.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.715
WHAT, IS SHE,
LIKE, A PAINTER?

18:08.750 --> 18:12.538
I BELIEVE IN CRYSTAL LIGHT
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN ME.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.410
I BELIEVE IN THE MOVIES
OF VAL KILMER,

18:14.460 --> 18:15.449
THOUGH THESE DAYS
IT AIN'T SO EASY.

18:15.490 --> 18:18.425
I BELIEVE IN DARREN SPROLES,
THE WORD "DABBLE,"

18:18.460 --> 18:20.257
THE FIRST SEASON
OF SILK STALKINGS,

18:20.300 --> 18:23.269
AND BIG, WARM, MOIST,
GOOEY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES

18:23.300 --> 18:25.666
THAT MELT IN YOUR MOUTH
AND ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

18:25.700 --> 18:26.689
FINALLY...

18:26.730 --> 18:29.665
I BELIEVE THAT YOU SECRETLY
TRIED TO DRUG IZZY

18:29.700 --> 18:31.338
SO THAT YOU COULD STEAL
HIS PLAYING TIME,

18:31.370 --> 18:32.598
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.800
- OH, MY.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.671
THAT WAS A STUPID SPEECH.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.371
- CAN YOU DENY IT?

18:37.410 --> 18:38.672
- [laughs]

18:38.710 --> 18:40.348
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, SHAWN.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.177
FIRST OF ALL,
IZZY DOESN'T NEED ANY HELP

18:42.220 --> 18:43.687
GETTING IN TROUBLE, OKAY?

18:43.720 --> 18:47.508
SECONDLY, IF I WAS CHEATING,
I WOULDN'T BE STUCK IN "A" BALL.

18:52.930 --> 18:56.650
[grunts]

18:58.800 --> 19:00.768
- WOW. HE REALLY GOT A HOLD
OF THAT.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.303

19:10.810 --> 19:13.813
- DO THE MACARENA!
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

19:13.850 --> 19:15.818
- IT'S CALLED REAL DANCING.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.318

TWO HOURS LATE TO THE PARK.

20:33.660 --> 20:34.752

20:34.800 --> 20:36.995
HE HAS A MAJOR
ATTITUDE PROBLEM.

26:32.150 --> 26:37.019
FOR 17 SEASONS, HE ATE CHICKEN
BEFORE EVERY SINGLE GAME.

26:37.060 --> 26:39.358
- I ALSO WON
FIVE BATTING TITLES

26:39.390 --> 26:42.120
AND WAS A 12-TIME ALL-STAR.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.128
- GRILLED OR CRISPY?

26:44.170 --> 26:45.159
- VERY FUNNY.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.168
- NO, NO, NO. GUS NEVER KIDS
AROUND ABOUT FOOD.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.168
- NOPE.
- MOSTLY CRISPY.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.009
- WOW. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
- SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

26:51.040 --> 26:52.007
- WOW.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.337
CAN WE GO ALREADY?

26:53.370 --> 26:56.032
- YEAH, JUST AS SOON
AS WE APOLOGIZE TO MEL.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.331
- YOU MEAN
AFTER YOU APOLOGIZE.

26:57.380 --> 27:00.008
CHECK IT OUT--
I STOLE WADE BOGGS' BELT.

27:00.050 --> 27:03.349
- WHY?
- BECAUSE HE'S WADE BOGGS.

27:03.380 --> 27:06.144
OH, NO.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.024
POOR IZZY.

27:19.830 --> 27:20.660
- YOU GUYS REALLY BELIEVE

27:20.700 --> 27:22.736
THAT I HIT IZZY JACKSON
OVER THE HEAD

27:22.770 --> 27:24.362
WITH A BASEBALL BAT
AND KILLED HIM?

27:24.410 --> 27:27.732
- WELL, WE'VE GOT TEN OF YOUR
PLAYERS THAT HAVE GONE ON RECORD

27:27.780 --> 27:29.031
SAYING YOU HAD IT OUT
FOR THE GUY.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.139
- AND YOU WERE SEEN
RUNNING AI-TER HIM

27:31.180 --> 27:32.101
MINUTES BEFORE HIS DEATH.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.209
- I WANTED TO GIVE HIM
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.217
I'LL ADMIT THAT.

27:35.250 --> 27:37.377
BUT I NEVER FOUND HIM.

27:37.420 --> 27:40.753
HEY, YOU GUYS GOT
TO BELIEVE ME.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.257
- WE DON'T.

27:44.430 --> 27:48.127
[door opens]

27:50.970 --> 27:52.699
- I BELIEVE HIM.

27:52.730 --> 27:55.062
I MEAN, WHY WOULD HE HIRE US
TO INVESTIGATE HIS PLAYERS

27:55.100 --> 27:57.091
AND THEN KILL ONE
THE NEXT DAY?

27:57.140 --> 27:58.937
- THROW US OFF THE TRAIL.
- I AGREE.

27:58.970 --> 27:59.902
- YOU'D SAY ANYTHING

27:59.940 --> 28:01.009
TO KEEP FROM WEARING
THAT SEABIRD SUIT AGAIN.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.770
- I CANNOT DENY THAT.
- IT DOES MAKE SENSE, SHAWN.

28:03.810 --> 28:05.778
HE WANTS IZZY OFF THE TEAM.
WHAT DOES HE DO?

28:05.810 --> 28:08.119
HE TRIES TO GET HIM
TO TEST POSITIVE FOR DRUGS.

28:08.150 --> 28:10.141
- THAT DOESN'T WORK,
SO HE SNAPS AND KILLS HIM.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.943
- COME ON,
YOU KNOW HOW MANY JERKS

28:11.990 --> 28:13.787
MEL'S COACHED
OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS?

28:13.820 --> 28:15.981
HE DIDN'T KILL ANY OF THEM.
THIS IS A REACH.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.079
- REALLY? THEN WHY DID WE FIND
A BAG FULL OF AMPHETAMINES

28:18.130 --> 28:19.427
IN HIS APARTMENT THIS MORNING?

28:19.460 --> 28:20.427
- GREENIES.

28:20.460 --> 28:22.451
- I'M SORRY, SHAWN.

28:29.300 --> 28:32.303
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.798
- HEY, DAD.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.169
DOES MEL BAT LEI-TY
OR RIGHTY?

28:39.210 --> 28:40.142
- UH, RIGHTY. WHY?

28:40.180 --> 28:43.047
- YES. IZZY WAS HIT FROM BEHIND
ON THE LEI-T.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.308
NOW, YOU TELL ME
HOW A RIGHT-HANDED HITTER

28:44.350 --> 28:45.510
COULD HAVE DONE THAT.

28:45.550 --> 28:47.757
- EASILY.
SWINGING BACKHANDED.

28:47.790 --> 28:49.257
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW?

28:49.290 --> 28:51.952
BUT...IT'S LIKE YOU WANT MEL
TO BE GUILTY.

28:51.990 --> 28:52.957
COME ON,
LET'S GO TALK TO WOODY.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.025
MEL NEEDS YOUR HELP
RIGHT NOW.

28:54.060 --> 28:55.254
- OH, SURE, HE NEEDS
MY HELP NOW.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.494
WHY DIDN'T HE CALL ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

28:56.530 --> 28:59.897
- OH, MY GOD, THIS IS ABOUT
HIM HIRING ME INSTEAD OF YOU.

28:59.930 --> 29:02.091
- I HAVE BEEN A SEASON TICKET
HOLDER FOR 20 YEARS, SHAWN.

29:02.140 --> 29:04.131
OH, HE'LL CALL ME UP WHEN HE
NEEDS A SPEEDING TICKET FIXED.

29:04.170 --> 29:06.968
BUT CALL ME FOR REAL
INVESTIGATIVE WORK? NAH!

29:07.010 --> 29:09.228
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW RIDICULOUS YOU SOUND?

29:09.280 --> 29:12.807
- YES, I DO...
NOW THAT I'VE SAID IT OUT LOUD.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.918
- SO I'VE PUT TOGETHER
A DEMONSTRATION FOR YOU GUYS,

29:15.950 --> 29:17.474
BUT I'M GOING TO NEED
A VOLUNTEER FIRST.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.147
I HAVE TO WARN YOU,
IT INVOLVES ME

29:19.190 --> 29:23.012
WHACKING YOU IN THE HEAD
WITH THIS BASEBALL BAT.

29:23.060 --> 29:25.119
NO TAKERS. WELL...

29:25.160 --> 29:27.822
THANK GOD I PACKED
A WATERMELON FOR LUNCH.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.088
- OOH.

29:29.130 --> 29:31.564
- WOODY, HOW IS WATCHING YOU
HIT A WATERMELON

29:31.600 --> 29:32.897
GONNA HELP US
WITH THE CASE?

29:32.930 --> 29:34.261
- WELL, GUS,
FIRST OF ALL,

29:34.300 --> 29:35.938
WATERMELON IS HIGH
IN VITAMIN "C,"

29:35.970 --> 29:37.835
WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE BRAIN.
- THAT'S TRUE.

29:37.870 --> 29:40.100
- AND SECONDLY,
IT WILL SUPPORT SHAWN'S CLAIM

29:40.140 --> 29:42.005
THAT MEL DIDN'T KILL
THIS YOUNG MAN.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.247
AS YOU CAN SEE--
EXCUSE ME, GUS--

29:44.280 --> 29:49.809
THE FRACTURE ON IZZY'S SKULL
IS NEARLY FOUR INCHES,

29:49.850 --> 29:51.386
WHICH MEANS THAT SOMEBODY
CLUBBED HIM HARD.

29:51.420 --> 29:55.959
- HARDER THAN A 60-YEAR-OLD MAN
SWINGING BACKHANDED

29:55.990 --> 29:57.218
WOULD BE CAPABLE OF.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.148
- CORRECT.
AND THAT WILL BE CLEAR

29:59.190 --> 30:01.454
ONCE I DO EXACTLY THAT
TO ONE OF YOUR HEADS.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.149
I MEAN THIS MELON.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.522
AND KEEP IN MIND,
I AM WELL SOUTH OF 60,

30:06.570 --> 30:08.492
AND I'M NO SLOUCH
AT THE PLATE MYSELF.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.337
I WAS ALL-CORONERS LEAGUE
FOR THREE SEASONS.

30:10.370 --> 30:12.338
PLAYED THE HOT CORONER.
[chuckles]

30:12.370 --> 30:14.304
I ALSO EMBALMED
SPARKY ANDERSON.

30:14.340 --> 30:16.001
ONE OF MY THRILLS.
- WOODY!

30:16.040 --> 30:17.200
COULD WE JUST
GET ON WITH IT?

30:17.240 --> 30:20.277
- OF COURSE. OKAY...
BATTER UP!

30:20.310 --> 30:22.346
HERE WE GO.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.539
- YEAH, I'M GONNA STATE
THE OBVIOUS HERE.

30:26.590 --> 30:28.251
THIS IS A COMPLETE
WASTE OF TIME.

30:28.290 --> 30:30.383
- I AGREE.
MEL DID IT, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.354
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WITH THE MOTIVATION TO KILL HIM.

30:32.390 --> 30:33.482
- YOU CAN DO THIS, WOODY.

30:33.530 --> 30:35.350
- HERE WE GO.

30:37.430 --> 30:39.295
NAILED IT!

30:49.540 --> 30:51.405
- FIRST OF ALL,
IZZY DOESN'T NEED ANY HELP

30:51.450 --> 30:54.374
GETTING INTO TROUBLE.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.378
- WE, AS AN ORGANIZATION,
ARE DEVASTATED

30:57.420 --> 30:59.047
OVER THE DEATH
OF IZZY JACKSON.

30:59.090 --> 31:02.218
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO HIM
AND HIS FAMILY.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.955
[camera clicking]

31:03.990 --> 31:05.548
- EXCUSE ME, MR. SPENCER.

31:05.590 --> 31:08.388
I'VE BEEN GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS
NOT TO LET YOU ON THE PREMISES.

31:08.430 --> 31:11.627
- CHERYL, I ONLY NEED A MINUTE
TO GET THE REST OF MY THINGS.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.524
- YOU GOT ONE MINUTE.

31:13.570 --> 31:16.937
- YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN.

31:16.970 --> 31:20.235
- WHAT THINGS?
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING HERE?

31:20.270 --> 31:22.272
- [quietly]
LISTEN, THE BAT THAT KILLED IZZY

31:22.310 --> 31:23.470
WAS 35 INCHES.

31:23.510 --> 31:26.479
THE ONLY PLAYER ON THE TEAM
THAT USES THAT SIZE WAS CAL.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.546
- SO YOU THINK HE KILLED HIM?
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

31:28.580 --> 31:31.413
I'M SURE HE HAS A LOGICAL
EXPLANATION FOR ALL OF THIS.

31:34.290 --> 31:36.019
HEY, WHERE'S CAL?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.550
- GONE.

31:37.590 --> 31:39.421
HIS LOCKER WAS CLEARED OUT
WHEN I GOT IN.

31:47.370 --> 31:49.292
- WHERE YOU HEADED, CAL?

31:51.340 --> 31:52.932
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
I'M HEADED, SHAWN?

31:52.970 --> 31:55.438
- OH, I DON'T KNOW...
CANADA, MAYBE?

31:55.480 --> 31:57.368
SOME OTHER LAWLESS COUNTRY

31:57.410 --> 31:59.275
WHERE THE AUTHORITIES WON'T BE
ABLE TO CATCH UP TO YOU?

31:59.310 --> 32:00.675
- SO I SEE I'VE GONE
FROM BEING YOUR IDOL

32:00.710 --> 32:02.348
BACK TO COLD-BLOODED KILLER,
HUH?

32:02.380 --> 32:04.348
- JUST LIKE OJ AND JAMIE FARR.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.381
- JAMIE FARR NEVER
KILLED ANYONE, SHAWN.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.012
- YOU'RE SO NAIVE.

32:08.060 --> 32:12.224
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS WHERE I'M HEADED.

32:15.000 --> 32:15.955
- OAKLAND.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.422
- MM-HMM.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.394
- OAKLAND OAKLAND?

32:19.430 --> 32:20.567
- THEY CALLED ME THIS MORNING.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.739
- YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO THE SHOW?

32:22.770 --> 32:25.068
OH!
- AND WE'RE BACK.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.999
- CAL!
WAIT A MINUTE.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.439
WHY WEREN'T YOU
IN THE LOCKER ROOM

32:29.480 --> 32:30.401
WHEN IZZY WAS KILLED?

32:30.440 --> 32:33.045
- I WAS HAVING MY KNEES ICED
BY THE TRAINER.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.968
AND YES,
HE CAN CONFIRM THAT.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.477
- I WILL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN.
DAMN IT, CAL!

32:37.520 --> 32:40.444
- OH, I WISH THAT WAS TRUE.
- UNH!

32:40.490 --> 32:41.980
- YEAH.
- AHH.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.227
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, MAN.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.319
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU
FOR PLAYING YOUR WAY BACK.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.658
- YEAH, WELL, IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO

32:48.700 --> 32:50.156
WITH THE WAY I PLAY, SHAWN.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.122
I WAS THE CHEAPEST OPTION.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.230
NOWADAYS. . .

32:55.270 --> 32:57.431
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE MONEY, SHAWN.

32:57.470 --> 33:01.008
YOU TAKE CARE.

33:03.380 --> 33:05.348
[engine starts]

33:05.380 --> 33:07.644
- PSYCH.
- HEY, BUDDY.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.272
- SHAWN, WHERE ARE YOU?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.617
AND WHY DO YOU SOUND MUFFLED?

33:10.650 --> 33:12.709
- UH, MUST BE COMING DOWN
WITH SOMETHING, BUDDY.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.217
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.182
- WAIT, SHAWN--

33:16.220 --> 33:18.279
- WHAT'S HAPPENIN', BABY?

33:18.330 --> 33:19.524
- AFTERNOON, MR. GUSTER.

33:19.560 --> 33:22.529
- DID YOU HEAR ABOUT PLUTO?

33:58.300 --> 34:00.165
THAT'S IT.

34:04.670 --> 34:06.763
[crash]
UNH!

34:06.810 --> 34:09.472
DAMN _IT!
[clatterlng]

34:20.450 --> 34:23.556
- THERE'S BEEN A BREAK-IN
IN THE MAIN OFFICE.

34:23.590 --> 34:28.527
- HEY, COME BACK HERE.
STOP!

34:39.610 --> 34:40.702
- LOOK OUT!

34:40.740 --> 34:42.571
[air blast]

34:42.610 --> 34:45.101
HERE COMES THE PAIN!

34:45.150 --> 34:47.448
[air blasts]

34:47.480 --> 34:50.472
- OUCH!

34:55.590 --> 34:58.525
- SHAWN, WHERE ARE YOU,
AND WHERE IS MY CAR?

34:58.560 --> 35:00.380
- I'LL EXPLAIN IT ALL
WHEN I SEE YOU.

35:00.430 --> 35:01.749
I'M ONLY A COUPLE
MINUTES AWAY.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.256
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:03.300 --> 35:04.494
- DRIVING AROUND FOR A BIT

35:04.530 --> 35:06.395
TO MAKE SURE NO ONE
WAS FOLLOWING ME.

35:06.430 --> 35:08.569
YOUR LEFT BLINKER'S OUT,
BY THE WAY.

35:08.600 --> 35:11.330
[tires screech, horn honks]

35:11.370 --> 35:14.601
GET THIS, I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS
AND SOME BAD NEWS

35:14.640 --> 35:15.470
AND SOME GOOD NEWS.

35:15.510 --> 35:17.808
HERE'S THE GOOD.
I KNOW WHO KILLED IZZY.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.171
- WHAT WAS THE BAD?

35:19.210 --> 35:20.472
- THE KILLER MAY KNOW
I'M ONTO HIM.

35:20.510 --> 35:23.411
- AND WHAT WAS THE OTHER GOOD?

35:23.450 --> 35:25.543
- HE MAY THINK THAT ME
IS ACTUALLY YOU.

35:25.590 --> 35:28.150
- HOW IS THAT GOOD NEWS?

35:28.190 --> 35:30.818
- I MEANT GOOD FOR ME.

35:30.860 --> 35:33.158
HELLO?

35:33.190 --> 35:35.351
GUS?
YOU STILL THERE OR WHAT?

35:37.800 --> 35:39.859
- UH, I KNOW YOU THINK
THAT I KNOW STUFF,

35:39.900 --> 35:42.664
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT I DON'T.

35:42.700 --> 35:46.238
IN FACT, IF YOU PROMISE
NOT TO SHOOT,

35:46.270 --> 35:48.773
I CAN TAKE YOU TO THE GUY
WHO REALLY KNOWS STUFF,

35:48.810 --> 35:50.175
AND THEN YOU CAN SHOOT HIM.

35:50.210 --> 35:53.407
IN FACT,
I MAY EVEN HELP YOU.

35:53.450 --> 35:55.338
- COME WITH ME.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.678
- COME ON, MAN! I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS!

35:57.720 --> 36:02.214
- I'D BE HAPPY TO
BRING YOU UP TO SPEED.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.524
YOU WERE RIGHT, GUS,
THIS SUIT DOES HAVE FLEAS.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.425
IT'S VERY UNPLEASANT.

36:06.460 --> 36:07.757
- YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
BROKE INTO OUR OFFICES.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.223
- INDEED I WAS.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.591
AND WHILE I WAS THERE
I DID

36:10.630 --> 36:12.666
SOME PRETTY INTERESTING
READING.

36:12.700 --> 36:14.395
GUS, DID YOU KNOW
THAT NEIL HERE

36:14.440 --> 36:16.863
IS THE YOUNGEST GM
IN TEAM HISTORY?

36:16.900 --> 36:18.868
AND THAT HIS FIRST BIG MOVE
WAS SIGNING IZZY JACKSON

36:18.910 --> 36:20.832
TO ONE OF THE RICHEST
ROOKIE CONTRACTS EVER,

36:20.870 --> 36:23.600
TO THE TUNE OF $12 MILLION?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.642
- WOW.
- YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY BOLD.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.443
- I BELIEVE IN TAKING RISKS.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.516
- YEAH, YOU DO, BUT THIS ONE
HASN'T QUITE WORKED OUT

36:29.550 --> 36:30.539
FOR YOU, HAS IT, NEIL?

36:30.580 --> 36:33.549
YOU SEE, IZZY'S IMMATURE,
AND WORST OF ALL...

36:33.590 --> 36:37.617
HE CAN'T HIT A CURVEBALL.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.582
WHICH IS A PROBLEM THAT
SIMPLY DOESN'T GO AWAY.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.622
NOW, LUCKILY, MOST OF THE MONEY
WAS TO BE PAID OUT

36:42.660 --> 36:44.696
AFTER IZZY IS PROMOTED
TO THE BIG LEAGUES.

36:44.730 --> 36:46.698
CERTAINLY YOU WEREN'T
STUPID ENOUGH

36:46.730 --> 36:49.995
TO GUARANTEE THAT PROMOTION
AFTER 60 GAMES.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.668
NO, WAIT, YOU WERE.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.803
- IF I DIDN'T OFFER HIM THAT,
ANOTHER TEAM WOULD HAVE.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.705
- YEAH,
IF THE TEAM SHELLED OUT

36:56.740 --> 36:58.844
10 MILLION MORE DOLLARS
TO THAT STIFF,

36:58.880 --> 37:00.745
YOU KNEW YOUR CAREER
WOULD BE TOAST.

37:00.780 --> 37:01.917
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:01.950 --> 37:03.713
WELL, FIRST YOU TRIED
TO RIG IT

37:03.750 --> 37:06.014
SO IZZY WOULD FAIL A DRUG TEST,
AND THAT DIDN'T WORK.

37:06.050 --> 37:08.757
THEN YOU TRIED TO TRADE HIM
TO ANYBODY.

37:08.790 --> 37:12.328
EVEN THE PIRATES
WEREN'T INTERESTED.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.499
I GUESS JUST INJURING HIM
WOULD HAVE BEEN WHAT,

37:14.530 --> 37:16.794
TOO TONYA HARDING-ISH FOR YOU?

37:16.830 --> 37:18.764
SO YOU TOOK
THE ULTIMATE STEP.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.337
- YOU KILLED HIM!
- REALLY?

37:21.370 --> 37:23.395
I DESERVED
TO SAY THAT, GUS.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.260
DO YOU KNOW ALL THE PIPE
I LAID TO GET THAT?

37:25.310 --> 37:26.607
- AND YOU WERE GONNA
PIN IT ALL ON THE GUY

37:26.640 --> 37:28.608
WHO MANAGED THE TEAM
FOR 30 YEARS.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.505
- I DREAMT OF BEING A GM
MY ENTIRE LIFE,

37:30.540 --> 37:33.373
AND I WASN'T GONNA LET
IZZY JACKSON RUIN IT.

37:33.410 --> 37:36.413
MOVE.

37:42.790 --> 37:44.985
- COME ON, NEIL, YOU'LL NEVER
GET AWAY WITH THIS, MAN.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.054
YOU'RE NOT A KILLER.

37:46.090 --> 37:47.785
- YOU WERE ALREADY SPOTTED
BREAKING INTO MY OFFICE.

37:47.830 --> 37:49.650
I'LL EXPLAIN THAT I ACT ED
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

37:49.700 --> 37:50.894
- NOBODY'S GONNA BUY THAT.

37:50.930 --> 37:53.660
- MY ALIBI SHOULD BE THE LEAST
OF YOUR CONCERNS RIGHT NOW.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.635
- DROP IT, NEIL!

37:56.670 --> 37:58.809
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SHOOT ME.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.535
- WHY AREN'T YOU IN OAKLAND,
EASON?

38:00.570 --> 38:01.673
- I WAS GEARING UP
FOR THE GAME,

38:01.710 --> 38:04.349
AND SOMETHING JUST KEPT
EATING AT ME.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.803
MEL COULDN'T HAVE HIS IZZY
BECAUSE HE BATS RIGHT-HANDED.

38:06.850 --> 38:09.648
I CAME BACK ON A HUNCH.
TURNS OUT I WAS RIGHT.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.341
- AND ALL YOU BROUGHT
WAS A BASEBALL BAT?

38:11.390 --> 38:12.641
- I SAID IT WAS A HUNCH.
GIMME A BREAK, HUH?

38:12.690 --> 38:14.817
COME ON, NEIL,
YOU'RE NOT A KILLER.

38:14.860 --> 38:15.918
- YEAH, WE ALREADY
TRIED THAT.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.689
- WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE, SHAWN!

38:17.720 --> 38:20.757
- OH, NO, WE'RE NOT.
WADE BOGGS IS HERE.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.554
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.521
- GET OUT OF HERE, WADE.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.767
- HEY, YOU'RE THE GUY
THAT STOLE MY BELT!

38:27.800 --> 38:30.394
- YES, SIR, I AM.

38:34.610 --> 38:35.770
- I CAN'T SHOOT WADE BOGGS.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.879
- CHICKEN.

38:42.650 --> 38:44.515
- OOH!

38:44.550 --> 38:45.687
- NICE, DAD!

38:45.720 --> 38:49.952
- WADE BOGGS!
I'M A GIANT FAN.

38:49.990 --> 38:51.878
- I AM NEVER COMING BACK HERE.

38:51.930 --> 38:55.422
- HEY--HEY, WADE...

38:55.460 --> 38:57.052
WHEN'S STEVE GARVEY
GETTING IN THE HALL OF FAME?

38:57.100 --> 38:58.727
- FAIR QUESTION.
THAT'S FAIR.

39:04.540 --> 39:07.429
- NOW, REMEMBER,
EXTEND THOSE ARMS, SHAWN.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.801
- KEEP THAT BACK ELBOW UP.

39:08.840 --> 39:09.932
- THE ELBOW'S FINE.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.504
- NO, IT ISN'T.
KEEP IT UP.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.676
- YOU KNOW WHAT DAD,
I THINK I'M GO

39:12.710 --> 39:13.870
WITH WADE BOGGS ON THIS ONE.

39:13.910 --> 39:15.616
- WHY? HE'S BEEN RETIRED
FOR 20 YEARS.

39:15.650 --> 39:17.675
NO OFFENSE.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.746
[chuckles]

39:20.790 --> 39:22.109
- ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

39:22.160 --> 39:24.628
- MEL. GREAT. LOOK...

39:24.660 --> 39:26.082
I'M GOING TO PROVE TO YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL

39:26.130 --> 39:28.451
THAT I HAVE THE SKILLS
NECESSARY

39:28.500 --> 39:30.752
FOR AT LEAST
ONE MINOR LEAGUE AT-BAT.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.894
YOU DISAGREE, ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS TELL ME I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH,

39:33.930 --> 39:35.932
AND I PROMISE I'LL NEVER
BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

39:35.970 --> 39:38.029
- SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL.
- [chuckles]

39:38.070 --> 39:41.528
- "SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL," HE SAID.
YOU HEARD IT.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.902
ALL RIGHT, RODRIGUEZ,
YOU BRING ME THAT SOFT STUFF.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.804
BRING IT TO ME
LIKE SOFT BREAD.

39:46.850 --> 39:48.169
- KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, SHAWN.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.519
- ELBOW UP.

39:50.550 --> 39:53.519
[dramatic music]

39:53.550 --> 39:57.850
*

39:57.890 --> 39:59.152
[explosion]

39:59.190 --> 40:00.452
[slowed-down grunt]

40:00.490 --> 40:08.090
*

40:16.640 --> 40:19.575
[clank]

40:19.610 --> 40:21.942
- OKAY, I--

40:21.980 --> 40:23.811
I DIDN'T QUITE GET
ALL OF THAT.

40:23.850 --> 40:25.147
- YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.579
LET'S GO, WADE.
WE GOT A GAME TO PLAN FOR.

40:27.620 --> 40:31.488
- OH, COME ON, MEL!
GIVE ME ONE MORE SHOT.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.680
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME, YOU'D BE
MANAGING IN THE PRISON LEAGUES.

40:33.730 --> 40:36.619
- I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HELP.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.663
SO IS IT TRUE YOU ONCE
DRANK 64 BEERS

40:39.700 --> 40:42.032
ON A TEAM FLIGHT
TO THE WEST COAST?

40:42.070 --> 40:43.935
- THAT'S SOMETHING
I'M NOT PROUD OF, MEL.

40:43.970 --> 40:46.165
BESIDES, THAT NUMBER
GETS DISTORTED

40:46.210 --> 40:47.563
EACH AND EVERY YEAR.

40:47.610 --> 40:50.078
- SO...
- 73.

40:50.110 --> 40:52.601
- [mouths words]

40:52.650 --> 40:55.016
- LET YOUR OLD MAN HAVE
A COUPLE OF CUTS.

40:55.050 --> 40:58.144
- MAN...

40:58.180 --> 41:00.489
YOU GOT AN UNDERHAND SETTING
ON THAT THING, RODRIGUEZ?

41:00.520 --> 41:01.953
- [chuckles]

41:01.990 --> 41:03.912
- HEY, HOW'D YOU KNOW
IT WAS NEIL, BY THE WAY?

41:03.960 --> 41:06.087
- I DIDN'T. I GOT TO THE
BALLPARK EARLY FOR THE GAME,

41:06.130 --> 41:07.825
SAW A GUY POINTING A GUN
AT YOU.

41:07.860 --> 41:11.523
I'M SO TIRED OF THE HAPPENING.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.130
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY
AND SWING

41:14.170 --> 41:15.899
WITHOUT YOUR GUT
LOOKING SO LARGE?

41:15.940 --> 41:18.158
[loud crack]

41:22.980 --> 41:24.709
- YOU KNOW, I MUST SAY...

41:24.750 --> 41:26.900
I'VE ENJOYED WORKING
THIS CASE WITH YOU.

41:26.950 --> 41:29.646
- YEAH.
I GUESS IT, UH...

41:29.680 --> 41:31.147
BROUGHT US TOGETHER
AND WHATNOT.

41:31.180 --> 41:32.579
- YEAH.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.612
YEAH, BASEBALL'S GOOD
THAT WAY.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.552
- HEY, WHAT'S MY WIFE DOING?

41:44.000 --> 41:46.059
- WOW.

41:46.100 --> 41:47.761
IT'S TIME THAT DUDE GOT
A NEW LADY.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.165
- YEAH.

41:51.240 --> 41:54.232
