00:01.830 --> 00:03.389
- Last season on Being Human...

00:03.630 --> 00:04.620
Close it.

00:04.670 --> 00:06.138
- (Mother): Traitor!

00:06.170 --> 00:08.058
You can rot underground.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.138
- You did things...
horrible things.

00:11.170 --> 00:13.639
- You're somewhere else?
- Limbo.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.136
And the pain!

00:15.180 --> 00:16.648
It's like
I'm trapped...

00:16.680 --> 00:18.444
forever.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.641
- I need to go to limbo.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.648
I have to save
Nick and Stevie.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.750
(Screaming)

00:22.790 --> 00:25.179
Aidan? Josh?

00:25.220 --> 00:27.416
I think I made a big mistake!

00:27.460 --> 00:28.313
- It was you.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.658
- (Nora):
If you kill Ray, your maker...

00:30.690 --> 00:32.226
(Screaming)

00:32.259 --> 00:33.250
...you don't just
cure yourself,

00:33.300 --> 00:35.758
- No, no! Get out!
- Oh my God!

00:35.800 --> 00:37.768
You cure whoever you made.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.165
Put it down!

00:40.600 --> 00:42.102
- Nora.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.199
(Gunshots)

00:51.250 --> 00:54.140
- I think it's a mistake to let a Jewish
werewolf loose on a crustacean.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.079
I said it.
- Really?

00:55.120 --> 00:56.190
- Yes.
- Great.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.279
- Regardless of what your people
think of shellfish,

00:58.320 --> 01:01.119
your knife
skills are shoddy.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.424
- How is this better
than just boiling it?

01:03.460 --> 01:07.226
- This way is faster
and it numbs the brains stem.

01:07.260 --> 01:08.159
- Oh, really?

01:08.200 --> 01:09.827
- I think it does.
It's what I've heard.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.339
- There he is,
future of medicine.

01:12.370 --> 01:14.293
- As a way to die,
that's not a bad way.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.263
It's not as bad as say,

01:16.310 --> 01:19.837
getting hunted down by a pack
of werewolves for sport.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.507
- Uh...

01:21.540 --> 01:23.440
- That's good
times. Yeah.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.313
You know what else is
really a crummy way to go?

01:26.350 --> 01:27.146
- What?

01:27.180 --> 01:27.920
- Is when you think
your best friend

01:27.950 --> 01:29.349
is gonna meet you
in the woods

01:29.390 --> 01:31.347
to help you kill Ray,

01:31.390 --> 01:35.315
and he bails, leaving you
vulnerable and exposed

01:35.360 --> 01:36.430
and dying alone
in the woods.

01:36.460 --> 01:37.723
(Sighing)

01:37.760 --> 01:40.650
- I think you're
overthinking it.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.364
The point is,
we all have to die.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.869
It's the natural
order of things.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.459
- Uh, no, no.
No, we don't.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.706
We don't have to die.

01:49.740 --> 01:52.232
- Seriously, don't mess with
Sally, 'cause she's very serious

01:52.280 --> 01:54.601
about the whole balance
of the universe thing.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.436
- Oh, come on.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.369
- Like kill-you-
in-the-face serious.

01:57.410 --> 02:00.277
- No. No, we don't.
We don't have to die.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.609
- Aidan, sorry, bud.
We all have to die.

02:04.650 --> 02:05.913
- Even you, sweetie.

02:05.950 --> 02:08.919
- No, no. No, we don't.
We don't have to die.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.123
We're not going to die.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.899
We're not going to die.

02:17.930 --> 02:21.764
* Oh that's
the way it goes *

02:21.800 --> 02:24.201
We're not going to die.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.800
(Rasp_y): _
We're not going to die.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.208
* No time for lullabies

02:30.250 --> 02:33.242
We're not going to die.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.510
We're not going to die.

02:35.550 --> 02:38.588
* No time for lullabies...

02:38.620 --> 02:40.918
I'm not going to die.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.622
(Gasping)

02:44.960 --> 02:47.156
(Screaming)

02:49.630 --> 02:54.932
* Here we are in
the pale moon light *

02:54.970 --> 02:58.463
* Telling me your lies *

02:58.510 --> 03:02.401
- So have you had
success before,

03:02.450 --> 03:05.249
contacting the...

03:06.580 --> 03:07.809
beyond?

03:07.850 --> 03:10.945
- You want very much
to find your friend.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.550
I sense great love there.

03:13.590 --> 03:15.649
How long
has it been?

03:15.690 --> 03:19.456
- It's been over a year.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.695
(Chuckles)

03:20.730 --> 03:25.463
I've called every
psychic, medium,

03:25.500 --> 03:27.298
ghost whisperer.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.707
- That's not really a thing.

03:29.740 --> 03:30.866
- I've called all of you.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.402
And I--I don't know,

03:33.440 --> 03:37.001
I'm really starting
to get scared

03:37.050 --> 03:39.314
that it's too late.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.444
- You need to open yourself,

03:41.480 --> 03:42.550
- OK.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.582
(Exhaling slowly)

03:45.620 --> 03:47.281
Josh?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.480
Josh?

03:52.500 --> 03:53.820
- Yeah?

03:53.860 --> 03:55.726
Are we doing--
We're doing this?

03:55.760 --> 03:56.761
- Yeah.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.290
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

03:58.330 --> 04:01.334
We've been to a lot of psychics.
Did I mention that?

04:01.370 --> 04:03.964
- I just want to say
before we, um,

04:04.010 --> 04:06.399
before we begin...

04:06.440 --> 04:07.032
(Sighing)

04:07.080 --> 04:09.276
I'm not, um...

04:09.950 --> 04:11.873
I'm not gonna
buy a candle...

04:12.750 --> 04:13.820
Or tea.

04:13.850 --> 04:16.547
- OK. Shall
we begin?

04:23.790 --> 04:25.952
I see...

04:27.930 --> 04:30.024
the woods.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.596
There--there was a fight.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.768
- Nora.

04:38.810 --> 04:42.371
- A bullet in me is the same
as a bullet in him, sweetheart!

04:42.410 --> 04:44.845
- Nora, he's--he's right.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.917
Shoot me, save yourself.

04:46.950 --> 04:48.941
Shoot me!

04:51.490 --> 04:53.049
Do it!

04:58.090 --> 04:59.080
- Now, Josh!
- What?

04:59.130 --> 05:00.529
- Take the gun!

05:00.560 --> 05:02.892
It's the only way
to cure both of us!

05:02.930 --> 05:04.489
- He's dying.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.794
- That's why you have
to finish it!

05:06.840 --> 05:08.296
(Groans)

05:14.580 --> 05:15.604
(Screaming)

05:24.850 --> 05:25.817
(Grunting)

05:25.850 --> 05:27.614
(Groans)

05:30.960 --> 05:32.519
(Ray groaning)

05:46.880 --> 05:48.336
- What did you see?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.348
- Darkness.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.777
And then laughter.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.839
Yes, tears and
then laughter.

05:58.890 --> 06:00.153
- What?

06:00.190 --> 06:02.830
- Laughter always
saves you two.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.698
- I'm dead inside.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.794
I swear, if we have to
go to another psychic,

06:11.830 --> 06:14.663
you're gonna be trying to
contact me on the other side.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.635
- But how else
do people like us

06:17.670 --> 06:20.605
find people like
Sally and Aidan?

06:20.640 --> 06:22.074
- You know
what's messed up?

06:22.110 --> 06:24.602
I've gotten to the point
where I think to myself:

06:24.650 --> 06:26.812
"Well, my ghost friend,
she's just in limbo,

06:26.850 --> 06:29.581
"so we should be able to
find her, like, no problem.

06:29.620 --> 06:34.080
"But my vampire friend,
he's God knows where."

06:34.120 --> 06:35.884
Who knows if
he's even alive?

06:35.920 --> 06:36.921
- Hey.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.655
- You have a
candle for that?

06:38.690 --> 06:39.691
- Come here.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.061
We exist, OK?

06:45.100 --> 06:48.536
Sally, Aidan...

06:49.710 --> 06:51.200
they exist.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.730
(Car honking)

06:52.780 --> 06:56.171
Which means that we
have to exist in a world

06:56.210 --> 06:59.407
where finding them
is a possibility.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.510
- Yeah.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.858
(Bird chirping)

07:11.860 --> 07:15.125
(Wind whistling)

07:23.810 --> 07:25.209
- Come on!

07:25.240 --> 07:27.106
- Sally, wait!

07:29.910 --> 07:31.446
- It's not gonna work.

07:32.580 --> 07:33.945
- Maybe the fact
that you say

07:33.980 --> 07:36.540
the exact same thing every time
we get to the door

07:36.590 --> 07:38.547
is what's messing us up.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.012
Maybe we could
just try it one time

07:40.060 --> 07:42.779
without you yelling "It's not
gonna work" in my face.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.856
- I'm just saying the other
784 times you tried it,

07:45.890 --> 07:46.789
it hasn't worked.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.094
- Have we been doing
this for that long?

07:49.130 --> 07:50.564
- I'm low-balling it.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.160
- At least we're together
when we're here.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.969
The rest of the time...

08:07.650 --> 08:09.209
(Doorknob rattling)

08:09.250 --> 08:11.116
- Told you.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.289
- One of these times,

08:13.320 --> 08:16.187
Aidan and Josh will
be there for us

08:16.220 --> 08:18.257
and this will all be over.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.624
We just have to
believe that, OK?

08:24.730 --> 08:27.165
No! No!

08:28.040 --> 08:32.135
Aidan! Josh! I'm here!

08:32.169 --> 08:33.831
(Sobbing)

08:33.880 --> 08:35.678
I'm right here!

08:45.320 --> 08:47.880
- We need a nurse here!

08:47.920 --> 08:49.251
(Telephone ringing)

08:49.290 --> 08:50.849
- Who's this?

08:50.890 --> 08:52.892
- Found him by Porter Square.
Lesions on his neck.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.991
He was stressing on the ride.
Couldn't even get his vitals.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.293
(Snarls)

08:57.330 --> 08:59.992
- You know what?
I'm just gonna take him.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.177
Aidan Waite,
do you know him?

09:07.210 --> 09:08.735
(Breathing heavily)

09:08.780 --> 09:11.078
- Everybody knew him
back in the day.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.817
- Where is he?

09:12.850 --> 09:14.978
- Think I got time
to keep tabs on him?

09:15.020 --> 09:16.681
- You know something.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.609
- No one knows
anything anymore.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.584
- This sickness.
What is it?

09:20.620 --> 09:22.725
I've seen it in
other vampires.

09:22.760 --> 09:26.321
You get the lesions and then
it seems fast, 2-3 days.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.896
It's in the blood, right?

09:27.930 --> 09:29.022
Is there a cure?

09:30.770 --> 09:32.829
- Does he know
where he is?

09:32.870 --> 09:33.894
- No.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.607
<i>- Gel the hell
away from me!</i>

09:37.640 --> 09:39.199
Why don't you
let us die in peace?

09:39.240 --> 09:40.605
- I'm sorry.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.642
- No, I'm--

09:42.680 --> 09:44.341
- You can't get
enough, can you,

09:44.380 --> 09:46.576
watching us rot?

09:50.050 --> 09:51.711
Friggin' werewolves!

09:51.750 --> 09:54.082
I'd watch myself
if I were you.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.110
(Coughs)

09:58.730 --> 10:00.220
- OK. This is it.

10:00.260 --> 10:03.890
We'll wait until the moon
gets high and then we'll know.

10:05.770 --> 10:07.864
- What if Brynn was wrong?

10:09.670 --> 10:11.866
What if killing Ray...

10:13.210 --> 10:15.372
what if it
didn't cure us?

10:15.410 --> 10:18.710
We could still
be wolves.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.013
And God, I...

10:20.920 --> 10:22.149
I told you
to kill him.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.147
- No.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.339
- Yes, I did.
- No.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.812
- I never should've
told you that.

10:25.850 --> 10:28.683
- I'd do it all over
again just to save you.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.256
- But if it didn't work...

10:30.290 --> 10:31.849
- It will.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.809
Nora.

11:01.060 --> 11:04.086
Nora? Oh my God!
I can't believe it!

11:04.130 --> 11:06.383
(Snarling)

11:16.370 --> 11:18.168
- The house-call
thing's good, right?

11:18.210 --> 11:20.975
I like a psychic who's
willing to travel.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.445
It also makes it about
10,000 times easier for them

11:23.480 --> 11:27.110
to scam us based on our magazine
subscriptions, but "whatevs"!

11:27.150 --> 11:28.845
- I think the fact
that we got

11:28.880 --> 11:30.382
Garden and Gun
and The New Yorker

11:30.420 --> 11:31.888
really keeps
people guessing.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.059
- Yeah, and throw
Highlights in there,

11:34.090 --> 11:35.956
you have the
insanity trifecta.

11:35.990 --> 11:37.924
- Oh, did you finish
this paperwork

11:37.960 --> 11:39.382
she wanted us
to fill out?

11:39.430 --> 11:41.125
- No. I started it.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.095
- It's like we're preparing for
a supernatural colonoscopy.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.689
- She's very thorough.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.434
- Is she walking away?

11:49.470 --> 11:51.859
- 'Cause you drank water
after 10:00? No.

11:51.910 --> 11:54.402
- No, I'm serious. This woman
right here walking away,

11:54.440 --> 11:55.930
you think that's her?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.274
Excuse me?

11:58.310 --> 12:00.142
<i>Sorry, waitl
Excuse me!</i>

12:00.180 --> 12:02.740
Are you looking
for 3638 Mayford?

12:03.550 --> 12:04.949
- I'm sorry.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.810
I can't go into
that house.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.259
I've been
here before.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.489
(Grunting)

12:13.530 --> 12:14.952
(Gasping)

12:15.000 --> 12:17.196
It's gotten worse
since then. Much worse.

12:17.230 --> 12:20.530
I can feel the pain
from that house out here.

12:20.570 --> 12:24.131
- You were the one who
tried to exorcize Sally.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.240
- He wanted me to.

12:25.270 --> 12:28.331
But I didn't, just like
I can't help you right now.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.870
I'm sorry.
- No, wait!

12:29.910 --> 12:31.969
If you had contact
with Sally before,

12:32.010 --> 12:35.241
don't you think that maybe
you could get it back now?

12:35.280 --> 12:36.350
- So she isn't here?

12:36.380 --> 12:37.347
- No.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.085
She went away.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.852
- We used to hear her
sometimes in the radio,

12:42.890 --> 12:45.530
just, you know, for a second
or two and then static.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.291
That's how we knew
that she was somewhere.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.890
- It's been months since
we've even heard that.

12:50.930 --> 12:53.831
We need to
bring her home.

12:53.870 --> 12:55.895
- You can't
just do that,

12:55.940 --> 12:58.102
crossing dimensions
back and forth.

12:58.140 --> 13:01.235
It's not like driving from
Pennsylvania into Delaware

13:01.280 --> 13:02.099
to buy a keg.

13:02.140 --> 13:05.576
- I didn't think
it was like that, so...

13:05.610 --> 13:07.248
- This is just
beyond what I can do.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.339
I wish I could give you
some comfort, but I...

13:09.380 --> 13:12.441
- No, wait! This is
not about our comfort.

13:12.490 --> 13:16.211
We've been trying to bring her
back for over a year now.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.480
At a certain point, it's gotta
be too late, don't you think?

13:19.530 --> 13:21.419
I mean, we can't
let that happen.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.098
Please.

13:23.130 --> 13:25.098
Help us.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.909
- OK. Um...

13:33.240 --> 13:35.072
You can go here

13:35.110 --> 13:36.430
and ask for
Ms. Gilchrist.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.550
But please don't tell her

13:37.580 --> 13:39.446
you got this from me.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.039
My involvement ends here.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.314
- Thank you.

13:44.350 --> 13:45.340
- Good luck.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.114
(Scoffing)

13:49.620 --> 13:51.258
- Aidan?

14:06.040 --> 14:08.930
* If suddenly

14:08.980 --> 14:13.110
* I can take to the sky

14:14.250 --> 14:18.380
* And I pull you with me

14:20.390 --> 14:23.587
* Don't open your eyes

14:23.630 --> 14:27.294
* Don't miss the surprise

14:28.130 --> 14:33.091
* When our 2 worlds collide *

14:33.140 --> 14:35.495
- I didn't die this way.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.304
<i>- I know.</i>

14:37.340 --> 14:39.308
You took pills.

14:39.340 --> 14:40.671
(Sighing)

14:40.710 --> 14:43.099
This is your limbo, Stevie...

14:44.380 --> 14:47.315
watching your family
go on without you.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.609
- It's happening again.

14:51.650 --> 14:53.414
- Yes.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.417
(Panting)

14:55.460 --> 14:57.258
We'll get out.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.024
- You're saying that again.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.939
- Josh, I'm here!

15:07.970 --> 15:10.962
Come answer the door!
I'm right here!

15:11.010 --> 15:13.138
(Sobbing)

15:16.010 --> 15:18.342
(Panting)

15:30.530 --> 15:31.520
- Miss Gilchrist?

15:38.330 --> 15:40.662
Hi.
- Hi!

15:40.700 --> 15:42.338
- Miss--Miss Gilchrist?

15:42.370 --> 15:44.600
- Donna.
- Donna.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.301
We were--we were told

15:46.340 --> 15:50.277
that you could help us,
um, find a friend.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.515
- Not here.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.512
In the kitchen.

15:57.550 --> 15:59.188
- OK.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.183
(Thudding)

16:04.230 --> 16:07.450
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.959
Mother, your forgiveness
will be my salvation.

16:15.270 --> 16:17.102
- OK, there, buddy.

16:17.140 --> 16:20.974
Just relax now, OK?

16:22.410 --> 16:24.742
I'm here to help,
you hear me?

16:24.780 --> 16:26.646
I'm a friend.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.542
Can you move?

16:37.360 --> 16:39.522
Well, I ain't gonna
lie to you, bro.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.027
You look rough.

16:42.060 --> 16:45.997
But it's all good.
You see, Mickey's got you now.

16:47.370 --> 16:50.340
Let me get you
set up here.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.668
And guess what?

16:54.440 --> 16:56.670
You are safe.

17:00.650 --> 17:02.175
- How long has she been gone?

17:02.220 --> 17:04.643
- Uh, over a year.
15 months.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.409
- And what makes you think
that she wants to come back?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.656
- Well, because limbo,

17:09.690 --> 17:11.727
if that's--if that's
what you call it,

17:11.760 --> 17:15.651
sounds pretty much like
the worst place ever.

17:15.700 --> 17:19.819
- The point of limbo is
that it hovers in between.

17:19.869 --> 17:21.759
There is always some place worse.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.438
- So you've been there
and you've come back?

17:23.470 --> 17:26.269
- I didn't say that.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.802
- All right.
Just tell me right now.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.309
Is there a way back?

17:31.350 --> 17:33.512
- You could not pull it off.

17:33.550 --> 17:34.676
- Is that a dare?
- What do you mean?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.415
- I don't know
how you got to me,

17:36.450 --> 17:38.782
and God knows if you were
given the proper warning,

17:38.820 --> 17:40.788
but what lies ahead
for you is more intense

17:40.820 --> 17:44.154
than your Haftarah portion of
the demise of Filene's Basement.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.351
- Try us.

17:45.390 --> 17:47.722
- $2,000.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.459
- I mean, yeah.

17:51.730 --> 17:54.438
- Yeah, that's...

17:54.470 --> 17:57.110
- OK. The money is
the least of it.

17:57.140 --> 17:58.801
You wanna bring
a soul back from limbo,

17:58.840 --> 18:01.377
then you gotta have
a real line to pull them in.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.572
Blood magic.

18:03.610 --> 18:06.443
You have to
bring me a heart.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.211
- A heart,
like a human?

18:10.320 --> 18:11.446
Sure.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.413
- Well, we work at
a hospital, so...

18:13.460 --> 18:15.110
- Exactly.
- We can do that.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.355
- It's a heart, it's...

18:16.390 --> 18:19.485
- OK. The heart of
someone you killed.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.126
- This is insane.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.821
- Yeah! Oh, that's it?
That's all?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.861
So you looked at us
and you saw a J-Crew ad

18:25.900 --> 18:29.131
and you figured you'd scare us
into, I don't know, like,

18:29.170 --> 18:32.868
paying you 2 grand and oh, just
the heart of a guy I killed.

18:32.910 --> 18:35.538
- I didn't say a guy,
but that's interesting.

18:35.580 --> 18:39.346
- You know, I'm getting really
fed up with you psychics.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.541
- I am not a psychic!

18:40.580 --> 18:41.741
- Exactly! Exactly!

18:41.780 --> 18:43.748
So what exactly--
What the hell are you?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.542
You look in a book?
You got a couple of books?

18:45.590 --> 18:48.287
We have a ton of books
at home! I can follow a book!

18:48.320 --> 18:49.412
- Of course you can.

18:49.460 --> 18:52.157
Look, could you
test this for me?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.398
Knees soft, right?

18:57.430 --> 19:01.799
Listen, you want your friend
back, you bring me a heart.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.808
(Slaps counter)

19:27.500 --> 19:30.390
(Crow cawing)

19:30.430 --> 19:32.762
- I never thought
we'd be back here.

19:32.800 --> 19:33.494
(Sighing)

19:33.540 --> 19:34.837
<i>- I know.</i>

19:37.840 --> 19:40.480
Are you OK?

19:42.580 --> 19:44.571
- I know it's--

19:46.950 --> 19:49.840
But to bring Sally back,
this way...

19:51.720 --> 19:54.212
this way, it would
be worth something,

19:54.260 --> 19:56.581
what I did to him.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.855
- Your humanity is
worth what we did.

20:12.270 --> 20:14.307
(Wheezing)

20:14.340 --> 20:16.570
- There he is.

20:16.610 --> 20:18.647
- What is this?

20:18.680 --> 20:23.641
- Why don't you shut
your bloodsucking face

20:23.690 --> 20:26.216
until I tell you
you can speak, OK?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.752
All that time down
in a pine box...

20:32.890 --> 20:34.756
rolling in
your own stink,

20:34.800 --> 20:37.724
bet you never thought that
you were the lucky one.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.963
They're all dead, bro.

20:43.000 --> 20:43.967
And the ones that ain't,

20:44.010 --> 20:47.332
well, they think that
you got what they need.

20:47.380 --> 20:51.499
And they are willing
to pay mightily for it.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.848
You're pure.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.315
At least that's what
they want to believe,

20:56.350 --> 21:00.287
like them African guys who think
they can cure their AIDS

21:00.320 --> 21:01.481
by banging virgins.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.715
Oh, crazy bastards.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.479
- What the hell are
you talking about?

21:05.530 --> 21:07.055
- There we are.

21:07.090 --> 21:11.493
You just be my honey pot.
That's all you be, hmm?

21:11.530 --> 21:13.567
(Groaning)

21:17.440 --> 21:19.807
(Grunting)

21:27.380 --> 21:30.042
- We were the only two
who knew about this.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.549
Now, Donna...

21:33.420 --> 21:35.809
- She's calling
the cops, Nora.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.521
(Grunts)

21:37.560 --> 21:40.393
- I just worry that
it's getting out of control!

21:40.430 --> 21:42.899
- Yeah, now it's
getting out of control.

21:45.670 --> 21:48.367
(Panting)

21:54.580 --> 21:56.674
(Flies buzzing)

21:56.710 --> 21:58.644
(Gasps)

22:05.450 --> 22:07.885
- Do you wanna at least
talk about this?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.887
That night?

22:14.860 --> 22:18.524
I know we're never gonna ever
really be able to get past it.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.829
But it was getting
to the point

22:22.870 --> 22:26.761
where I wasn't seeing his face
every time I closed my eyes,

22:26.810 --> 22:29.939
where you weren't
waking up in a cold sweat.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.641
(Grunting)

22:31.680 --> 22:35.548
It was as close to normal
as you and I might get.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.388
I just don't want you
to suffer anymore.

22:41.420 --> 22:42.979
(Grunting)

22:43.020 --> 22:44.784
(Panting)

22:46.830 --> 22:48.855
- I can't--
I can't do this.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.761
I'll never cut through
the breastplate with this.

23:02.210 --> 23:03.200
(Josh clearing throat)

23:03.240 --> 23:06.005
- Oh, you have to come by
during dinner prep?

23:06.050 --> 23:10.749
- How is a witch entrusted
with feeding the needy?

23:10.790 --> 23:12.747
- I'm just wondering.
- Why would you insult her?

23:12.790 --> 23:14.758
- I'm nervous.
This is weird.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.179
Please, just
give me that, OK?

23:17.220 --> 23:19.382
- We have it.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.567
- Ooh!

23:24.600 --> 23:26.420
Not too tidy, is it?

23:26.470 --> 23:27.892
- You know, we went
through kind of a lot

23:27.940 --> 23:30.807
to find ourselves right here
right now with you.

23:30.840 --> 23:35.903
And so, yes,
it's a little messy,

23:35.940 --> 23:39.046
but the man was not
in the best state.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.070
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.110 --> 23:43.171
- So, you know what, though?
That's the heart.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.540
We found it.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.581
- So how does
this spell work?

23:46.620 --> 23:49.089
Why a heart?
Why that heart?

23:49.120 --> 23:51.157
- Well, it has to be
a heart that you stopped,

23:51.190 --> 23:54.524
because the life,
I mean, the force of life

23:54.560 --> 23:55.698
was in your hands.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.789
The heart is everything.

23:57.830 --> 24:00.470
We use it in the incantation,
in the salve.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.229
(Chuckling)

24:02.270 --> 24:05.535
- Salve. And so, uh,
what's the salve for?

24:05.570 --> 24:07.572
Is it to make our hands clean
afterwards or something?

24:07.610 --> 24:08.702
It's poetic, I guess.

24:08.740 --> 24:09.707
- Josh.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.139
- I don't know, Nora.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.547
- Uh, the salve
is for the body.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.213
For your friend's body.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.253
Oh! Come on, kids.

24:22.290 --> 24:25.157
You can't split hairs
with the soul.

24:25.190 --> 24:28.125
If you're bringing her back,
you're bringing her back

24:28.160 --> 24:30.094
from the dead.

24:34.270 --> 24:36.238
- (Man): This is what
we agreed on.

24:36.270 --> 24:38.830
- No, that's not
what we agreed on.

24:38.870 --> 24:40.099
That's not what
we agreed on.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.699
That's for
2 pints of pure.

24:41.740 --> 24:42.810
What you want now,

24:42.840 --> 24:44.103
that's a whole
new ballgame.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.948
See now, if you
want that much,

24:45.980 --> 24:48.039
you're gonna have
to buy the whole cow.

24:48.080 --> 24:51.539
The whole cow
don't come cheap, friend.

24:51.590 --> 24:54.059
- This is all the
money I can offer you.

24:55.990 --> 24:59.153
- Well, then why don't you
get your ass out of here?

25:02.330 --> 25:04.264
(Grunting)

25:04.300 --> 25:06.098
(Groaning)

25:12.270 --> 25:13.908
- Hello, brother.

25:13.940 --> 25:15.908
(Sighing)

25:18.950 --> 25:21.214
(Gasping)

25:25.650 --> 25:27.015
(Groans)

25:40.740 --> 25:42.060
Are you insane?

25:42.100 --> 25:44.535
That blood
could kill you!

25:45.770 --> 25:47.329
Come on!

25:47.370 --> 25:49.031
(Grunting)

25:54.820 --> 25:55.969
Mother's dead.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.681
They're all dead

25:57.720 --> 26:01.054
or disappeared in search
of untainted blood.

26:01.090 --> 26:04.060
A human virus, flu,

26:04.090 --> 26:05.979
spread around the world.

26:06.030 --> 26:08.590
They got their vaccines
and took their drugs,

26:08.630 --> 26:13.659
but us, any of our brothers who
fed from a tainted human, this.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.134
- You're--you're sick?

26:15.170 --> 26:18.060
- A few days ago, one of ours
brought home tainted meat.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.306
We should've
been more careful,

26:20.340 --> 26:22.069
but the hunger...

26:22.110 --> 26:25.978
They sent me to Boston
to find help or a cure.

26:26.010 --> 26:29.014
I found better, brother.

26:29.050 --> 26:31.144
I found you.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.685
(Coughing)

26:35.990 --> 26:38.254
(Both grunting)

26:40.260 --> 26:42.251
- This is...

26:42.860 --> 26:44.897
- I know. I know.

26:44.930 --> 26:46.091
I know.

26:46.130 --> 26:48.132
I just keep thinking
about it, OK?

26:48.170 --> 26:51.800
I gave the guy $200.
I told him we'd out by dawn.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.932
- Wasn't he...

26:52.970 --> 26:54.233
(Panting)

26:54.280 --> 26:56.772
...like, oddly calm
about the whole thing,

26:56.810 --> 27:00.041
as if people bribe him
all the time to dig up bodies?

27:00.080 --> 27:01.741
- Oh, they definitely do.

27:04.020 --> 27:06.341
(Both panting)

27:06.390 --> 27:08.859
- But do you think anyone
does what we're doing?

27:08.890 --> 27:11.655
- We're bringing Sally back.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.356
- As what?

27:17.130 --> 27:18.666
- As Sally.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.053
(Grunting)

27:58.770 --> 28:00.807
Oh my God!

28:01.380 --> 28:03.872
- OK.

28:03.910 --> 28:05.947
Let's get her
out of here.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.210
- OK.

28:11.390 --> 28:15.088
(Man singing
rock 'n' roll on stereo)

28:18.490 --> 28:21.050
- You're about to be eaten
by a pack of rabid,

28:21.100 --> 28:23.398
virus-stricken,
Amish vampires.

28:23.430 --> 28:24.226
(Josh chuckling)

28:24.270 --> 28:26.227
Holy crap, Aidan!

28:26.270 --> 28:29.035
- What exactly do you
expect me to do about it?

28:29.070 --> 28:31.038
- Uh, blow a rape whistle.

28:31.070 --> 28:33.778
- On the other hand,

28:33.810 --> 28:35.209
let's face it, you know,
if you're gonna go,

28:35.240 --> 28:38.073
there are less
original ways to--

28:38.110 --> 28:40.818
- What, you're saying that Aidan
should die for style points?

28:40.850 --> 28:44.047
- I'm not gonna die.
I'm not going to die.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.980
- It kind of looks
like you are, though.

28:47.020 --> 28:49.489
- Oh! Pfft! Bishop!

28:49.520 --> 28:52.785
- Uh, excuse me, we were trying
to have a conversation.

28:52.830 --> 28:55.925
- Yeah, I know. I was trying
to nap through it.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.292
Aidan, listen. It is
an insult to my memory

28:58.330 --> 28:59.866
that you would
rather imagine

28:59.900 --> 29:01.959
these two throwing
daisies on your grave

29:02.000 --> 29:06.210
than getting up and actually
doing something about this.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.301
Look, Atlee is sick.

29:09.340 --> 29:11.172
He's not even one of
the scary Amish.

29:11.210 --> 29:12.041
Come on, man!

29:12.080 --> 29:13.377
- Hey! I know you're not
thinking clearly

29:13.410 --> 29:15.014
because your head
was cut off,

29:15.050 --> 29:17.246
but Aidan isn't exactly at
fighting weight right now.

29:17.280 --> 29:21.513
- I'm not fighting. I've played
out every battle in my head,

29:21.560 --> 29:24.120
every act of revenge,
every act of malice.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.527
And I'm telling you,
I'm done.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.255
(Sighing)

29:31.130 --> 29:32.996
Oh, God.
Finally, I'm done.

29:33.030 --> 29:34.964
(Clearing throat)

29:37.040 --> 29:38.838
Oh, come on, man!
Would you just give me a break?

29:38.870 --> 29:41.032
I don't need to
make you understand

29:41.080 --> 29:43.003
that you are not
a part of this.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.405
- No, you don't.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.101
Hmm... That's weird, 'cause
you made me a part of it.

29:47.150 --> 29:49.346
You put me in
the front seat.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.986
I am in your head,
remember?

29:52.020 --> 29:55.809
- That is something that
I've been meaning to forget.

29:55.860 --> 29:59.285
- You cannot forget
who you are.

29:59.330 --> 30:01.253
You were a warrior
when I found you.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.962
I made you one of
the best there is.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.163
Now fight.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.362
- Yeah, I kind of get it now.
He's super compelling.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.233
- I kind of want
to make out with him.

30:17.110 --> 30:19.169
(Honking, tires screeching)

30:19.210 --> 30:21.247
(Grunting)

30:23.950 --> 30:24.746
(Groaning)

30:28.190 --> 30:30.852
- I'm to share you
with my brothers,

30:30.890 --> 30:31.857
but look at you,

30:31.890 --> 30:34.097
so frail,

30:34.130 --> 30:35.529
emaciated.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.597
They would Kill
each other over what?

30:38.930 --> 30:40.625
Scraps?

30:40.670 --> 30:44.402
I'm going die, Aidan,
if you don't save me now.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.608
(Growling)

30:47.640 --> 30:48.835
- Aaah!

30:52.050 --> 30:54.018
- Sorry.

31:02.660 --> 31:06.255
- The thing to remember is that
she won't be human, not really.

31:06.290 --> 31:08.452
- Yeah, but she'll
look human, right?

31:08.500 --> 31:11.595
Because that just seems
like a big leap from here.

31:11.630 --> 31:15.498
- So then what? Does
that make her a zombie?

31:15.540 --> 31:17.668
- Zombies are in
a trance-like state.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.203
They're unaware of
what they've become.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.379
You know, there's
NO consciousness.

31:22.410 --> 31:23.605
Your friend will be aware,

31:23.640 --> 31:25.608
and that could prove
to be a problem.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.209
- What's that supposed to mean?

31:27.250 --> 31:30.379
- When she awakes, you need
to make her understand --

31:30.420 --> 31:32.081
I mean, once she recovers

31:32.120 --> 31:34.589
from the possibly horrifying
shock that she's topside --

31:34.620 --> 31:36.987
that she cannot pick up
where she left off.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.556
There's no running
home to mother.

31:38.590 --> 31:40.149
- Her mother's dead.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.521
- I don't care.

31:41.560 --> 31:47.260
No reunions, no people
from her past.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.292
That's the catch.
Do you understand?

31:50.340 --> 31:52.138
- Got it. Got it.

31:52.170 --> 31:54.969
Listen, I hate to keep
coming back to this,

31:55.010 --> 31:56.034
but she'll be OK, right?

31:56.080 --> 31:59.141
I just-- I can hear the
conversation with her now.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.239
And Sally would kill me
if I brought her back

32:01.280 --> 32:04.147
and she's got, like, you know,
worm holes in her face.

32:04.190 --> 32:07.182
- The salve restores the body.

32:07.220 --> 32:11.225
The incantation reanimates it.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.456
Are you ready?

32:13.560 --> 32:16.291
This is your last
chance to say no.

32:16.330 --> 32:18.196
- Yeah.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.163
- Yeah, uh, yeah.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.167
(Clears throat)

32:20.200 --> 32:21.167
Absolutely.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.066
Absolutely, yeah.

32:23.100 --> 32:26.638
Just like, uh, just like
being at a day spa, right?

32:26.670 --> 32:29.037
It's like a--
It's like a mud wrap?

32:29.080 --> 32:30.002
Right?

32:30.040 --> 32:32.304
Only instead of mud,
it's, like, the heart

32:32.350 --> 32:34.341
of a man
that I killed.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.178
No, it's otherwise
completely normal.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.609
- OK, please stop talking.
- All right.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.952
(Speaking foreign language)

33:01.680 --> 33:03.205
- Sally!

33:03.240 --> 33:04.401
- Sally, wait!

33:04.450 --> 33:06.703
- No, guys.
We have to keep trying!

33:06.750 --> 33:09.617
- Sally, we've been
thinking about this.

33:09.650 --> 33:12.585
- When do you guys
have time to conspire?

33:12.620 --> 33:13.746
- During the running.

33:13.790 --> 33:16.009
- Yeah. Oh, and when
you're screaming.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.154
You know, we have
time there too.

33:18.190 --> 33:20.579
- It's not gonna be
different this time, Sally.

33:20.630 --> 33:22.189
It's OK. Who knows?

33:22.230 --> 33:25.200
Maybe if you admit it,
it will get you out of here.

33:25.230 --> 33:26.368
- No, guys.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.392
This is gonna
get us out of here.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.396
(Sighing)

33:30.440 --> 33:32.499
(Door opening)

33:41.650 --> 33:44.085
(Speaking foreign language)

33:44.120 --> 33:45.087
- Is it working?

33:45.120 --> 33:46.519
- You don't think you'll
know if it's working?

33:46.550 --> 33:48.382
- I didn't think
it would take this long.

33:48.420 --> 33:49.751
- Josh.
- No, I mean...

33:49.790 --> 33:52.782
Do we have any proof?

33:52.830 --> 33:55.458
Do we? I mean, it's not like
we can check her references.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.820
You tell me, Donna.

33:56.860 --> 33:59.124
Is there a recently revived
corpse in Nantucket

33:59.170 --> 34:00.126
that we should call?

34:00.170 --> 34:02.229
- This is so the wrong
time to be doing this.

34:02.270 --> 34:03.635
- No, you know,

34:03.670 --> 34:08.835
he should understand that
there are no guarantees.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.473
- What the hell
does that mean?

34:10.510 --> 34:13.706
- Where she is,
it's like an ocean.

34:13.750 --> 34:16.172
It's endless.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.143
All we can do is throw her a
life raft, shine a light on it.

34:18.190 --> 34:21.181
It is up to her whether
or not to climb on board.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.788
- It's up to Sally.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.856
- Mm-hmm. But this will not
work unless you have faith.

34:27.889 --> 34:30.552
- Like, in God? You're
talking to me about God?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.819
- Why do you wear
a Star of David?

34:32.870 --> 34:34.395
- Because when I wear it,

34:34.440 --> 34:37.193
I remember believing
in a world that makes sense.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.231
Right now, I'm standing
in a soup kitchen,

34:39.270 --> 34:41.476
hovering over
my friend's dead body,

34:41.510 --> 34:43.308
having just rubbed the bits

34:43.340 --> 34:47.743
of a man's heart
that I murdered on her.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.416
How is this-- How is
this happening? How?

34:53.449 --> 34:54.382
- Josh.

34:54.420 --> 34:56.411
- No, no. Nora, no.
- Josh.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.882
- No, no, no.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.390
All T've ever wanted to do
was make things right for you.

35:01.430 --> 35:04.400
But it's insane to think
that I could save anyone.

35:04.430 --> 35:06.467
You, Julia, Aidan.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.434
Aidan is God knows where!

35:08.470 --> 35:10.359
Sally's here,
but my God!

35:11.810 --> 35:13.733
How do we know that
this is gonna work?

35:13.770 --> 35:15.829
We're waiting for her
to take a raft!

35:15.880 --> 35:18.747
Why would she want
to come back to this?

35:20.510 --> 35:22.842
- It's OK.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.180
It's gonna be OK, OK?

35:26.220 --> 35:28.609
It has to be OK.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.593
- I'm telling you,
this is it.

35:38.530 --> 35:39.929
Go in.

35:39.970 --> 35:42.439
- You go in.

35:42.470 --> 35:43.631
- It's your door.

35:43.670 --> 35:45.399
- Well, what if it has an
Indiana Jones hair-trigger thing

35:45.440 --> 35:48.239
and it closes behind me
the second I walk through?

35:48.280 --> 35:49.770
(Chuckling)

35:49.810 --> 35:52.609
If there's a chance for us
to leave this place,

35:52.650 --> 35:54.277
you two are gonna take it.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.809
- (Nick): How do we know
what's behind that door?

36:01.660 --> 36:03.856
- You could find Zoe again.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.520
You could stop dying in front
of your parents' house,

36:09.560 --> 36:11.892
watching them
night after night.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.898
You two are going
through that door.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.698
Now!

36:41.830 --> 36:43.855
- This can't be it.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.367
(Inhaling)

36:54.510 --> 36:56.330
Ah!

36:57.480 --> 36:59.244
(Chuckling)

37:00.410 --> 37:02.447
Oh my God!

37:05.820 --> 37:08.482
(Wheezing)

37:16.300 --> 37:17.358
(Groaning)

37:21.470 --> 37:23.734
- It didn't work.

37:23.770 --> 37:25.704
I don't understand.

37:25.740 --> 37:29.870
Your blood is
supposed to be pure.

37:29.910 --> 37:32.902
You were supposed
to cure me.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.314
(Rustling)

37:39.650 --> 37:41.516
(Tires screeching)

38:01.410 --> 38:03.629
- What do you think
it'll feel like

38:03.680 --> 38:05.045
when she wakes up?

38:05.080 --> 38:07.777
- Confusing.
Wouldn't it be?

38:07.810 --> 38:10.017
I mean, there's the
Sally that we know,

38:10.050 --> 38:11.711
and then there's...

38:11.750 --> 38:13.844
- This is Sally.

38:14.990 --> 38:16.810
Or it will be.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.594
- We'll help her.

38:21.630 --> 38:24.930
- Do you think she'll
even want to be here?

38:24.970 --> 38:27.564
- It's gotta be better
than the alternative.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.495
Doesn't it?
I mean...

38:30.540 --> 38:32.338
(Wheezing)

38:44.420 --> 38:45.819
(Gasps)

38:45.850 --> 38:47.443
- Sally.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.897
(Wheezing)

39:00.930 --> 39:03.433
- S-s-st--

39:03.470 --> 39:05.029
- It's OK, Sally,
we're here.

39:05.070 --> 39:07.539
- It's all right, sweetheart.
- Just take your time.

39:07.570 --> 39:09.937
- Yeah, take your time.
Just say it.

39:09.980 --> 39:10.936
(Wheezing)

39:10.980 --> 39:14.348
- S-s-stevie...

39:15.480 --> 39:17.448
and Nick...

39:18.450 --> 39:20.589
here.

39:20.620 --> 39:22.884
- It's OK, Sally.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.724
- Did she just say that
Stevie Nicks is here?

39:26.760 --> 39:28.125
- No, obviously not.

39:28.160 --> 39:31.130
- Well, not obviously,
that's exactly what she said.

39:31.160 --> 39:34.130
- Why would she say that?
- She said Stevie Nicks is here.

39:34.170 --> 39:36.593
Stevie! Stevie!
Stevie and Nick.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.369
Stevie and Nick?

39:41.070 --> 39:42.879
- On the life raft.

39:42.910 --> 39:45.607
They jumped on
the life raft.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.607
Sally, where
are they?

39:47.650 --> 39:48.617
(Gasps)

39:48.650 --> 39:52.041
- With me.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.142
- Oh my God!

39:54.190 --> 39:57.080
What if they just woke up
inside their coffins?

40:03.600 --> 40:05.568
(Birds chirping)

40:08.500 --> 40:11.663
(Speaking foreign language)

40:46.810 --> 40:50.007
- Now, what are we going
to do with you?

40:54.980 --> 40:57.119
(Crickets chirping)

41:12.070 --> 41:15.734
* Safety net don't hold me now

41:15.770 --> 41:17.795
(Breathing shallowly)

41:20.740 --> 41:24.506
- Exsanguinated? Right?
That's what they call it?

41:25.180 --> 41:27.603
That bastard
sucked your blood?

41:28.620 --> 41:30.611
Does this mean--
- He's dying.

41:35.890 --> 41:37.858
You're dying,
aren't you?

41:37.890 --> 41:40.086
- Shut up.

41:40.130 --> 41:41.598
- Aidan!

41:41.630 --> 41:44.895
- We are not going to die.

41:44.930 --> 41:47.160
(Crying)

41:49.800 --> 41:51.859
I am not going to die.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.265
(Breathing shallowly)

41:56.210 --> 41:58.804
(Breathing stops)

41:58.850 --> 42:02.275
* I've had enough

42:06.150 --> 42:08.653
(Gasping)

42:08.690 --> 42:10.180
No!

42:10.220 --> 42:12.757
No, fight!

42:14.060 --> 42:16.757
* You are free

42:25.910 --> 42:29.107
* And in the thickness

42:30.180 --> 42:32.308
* You'll find me

42:39.290 --> 42:41.543
* Find me

42:50.130 --> 42:53.828
* In the city you find faith

42:58.170 --> 43:01.834
* In the people you see fear

43:05.780 --> 43:09.944
* That remind you of your own

43:13.150 --> 43:18.589
* Let it go

43:20.960 --> 43:25.363
* Skin come off *
