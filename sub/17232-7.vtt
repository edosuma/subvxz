WEBVTT

00:01.979 --> 00:03.167
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.168 --> 00:05.130
I would love to represent
you and your band.

00:05.131 --> 00:06.931
I think my music speaks for itself.

00:06.932 --> 00:09.853
Then what are you doing here?
Did you sleep with that woman?

00:11.603 --> 00:12.638
Are you asking me out?

00:12.639 --> 00:14.335
I'm asking you... in.

00:14.336 --> 00:15.601
Let's get outta here. And go where?

00:15.602 --> 00:17.450
We're young, we're hot, and I've got a jet.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.709
We've kept this secret a long time.

00:20.035 --> 00:21.115
Is this as bad as it looks?

00:21.116 --> 00:22.744
Cheating husbands are my bread and butter.

00:22.745 --> 00:24.726
So you came to me to find your voice again.

00:24.727 --> 00:26.502
Sometimes you gotta blow up the box.

00:26.503 --> 00:28.092
He's my guy. This is my sound.

00:28.093 --> 00:29.322
There are other labels in this town

00:29.323 --> 00:31.044
who would buy out my contract.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.380 --> 00:45.965
Well? I love it.

00:45.966 --> 00:50.684
And I have this lyric
that would be so perfect.

00:50.685 --> 00:53.670
I will tell her. Yeah. I'll
get right back to you.

00:53.868 --> 00:54.398
What?

00:54.399 --> 00:56.385
Uh, you know how Edgehill's
doing a live recording

00:56.386 --> 00:58.558
of the 25th anniversary show at the Ryman?

00:58.559 --> 00:59.312
Yes.

00:59.313 --> 01:01.229
The high church of country music.

01:01.230 --> 01:04.596
Right, well, Marshall Evans
wants to follow that release

01:04.598 --> 01:06.849
with an album of your greatest hits.

01:08.120 --> 01:08.724
What? I know.

01:08.725 --> 01:10.958
Said no. We are not doing that.

01:11.167 --> 01:13.929
I swear. That guy. It never stops.

01:15.808 --> 01:17.266
You know I've done every anniversary show

01:17.267 --> 01:19.170
that this label has ever had?

01:19.171 --> 01:20.093
Yep.

01:21.490 --> 01:25.345
I'm gonna close this show with one of these
new songs.

01:25.637 --> 01:29.943
well, okay, but I don't know if this is
the right time.

01:29.944 --> 01:31.107
I think it is.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.898
Cheers to that.

01:41.304 --> 01:43.666
Sure nice doin' something
other than football.

01:44.072 --> 01:47.395
Seems like every hour of my life
is spent working on the game.

01:47.993 --> 01:50.611
All work and no play? That's no good.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.522
Hey, I'm playing a set
at the Ryman this week.

01:53.624 --> 01:55.348
It's my label's anniversary concert,

01:55.349 --> 01:57.192
so it's kind of a big deal. Mm.

01:57.193 --> 02:00.065
Do you wanna come? Get
your mind off the game?

02:00.728 --> 02:01.763
With you?

02:03.148 --> 02:04.203
Yes.

02:04.204 --> 02:05.222
Juliette.

02:05.868 --> 02:07.494
Juliette, we need to talk.

02:08.309 --> 02:09.431
I'm busy.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.801
Yeah, and I'm serious. Come on.

02:12.393 --> 02:13.714
So it's already getting
that much play, huh?

02:13.715 --> 02:16.115
They devoted a whole segment to it on ESPN.

02:16.116 --> 02:17.719
Xxx

02:17.720 --> 02:20.438
at the Edgehill's aniversary show
on Sunday,

02:20.439 --> 02:22.714
some other awful thing
happens in the world,

02:22.715 --> 02:23.871
we're back on track.

02:23.872 --> 02:25.290
What are y'all talking about?

02:25.680 --> 02:26.858
Makena thought that you cozying up

02:26.859 --> 02:29.249
to Mr. goody two-shoes over there

02:29.250 --> 02:30.855
would help your negatives, and it did,

02:30.856 --> 02:32.103
for about ten minutes.

02:32.104 --> 02:33.111
What she didn't account for

02:33.112 --> 02:36.253
was all the negative press
it would generate for him.

02:36.254 --> 02:38.394
Some of his fans are
holding you responsible

02:38.395 --> 02:41.253
for his poor passing in
the last couple games.

02:41.737 --> 02:44.637
Okay. Who cares what a bunch
of football nuts think?

02:44.638 --> 02:48.439
It's not just them. It's the tabloids, too.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.070
People don't like their
heroes dating kryptonite.

02:52.071 --> 02:54.384
I am not kryptonite, all right?

02:54.503 --> 02:55.799
And we're not even dating. I don't...

02:55.800 --> 02:57.330
I don't know what we are.

02:57.512 --> 02:59.799
Is this what you brought me
over here to talk about?

02:59.800 --> 03:00.697
No.

03:00.698 --> 03:03.891
Marshall Evans wants to see you...
personally.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.130
Don't tell me he's a football fan, too.

03:10.455 --> 03:13.716
Xx

03:13.717 --> 03:16.253
what'd you get? Look at this. Perfect.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.282
Welcome to your first taste of success.

03:18.283 --> 03:19.462
Oh, we look good in big letters.

03:19.463 --> 03:20.801
Yes, you do.

03:21.336 --> 03:22.981
Man, I've barely been able
to get in this venue,

03:22.982 --> 03:24.597
much less play it.

03:24.598 --> 03:26.154
I've called every producer,

03:26.155 --> 03:28.950
every entertainment reporter,
every music blogger in town.

03:29.052 --> 03:31.156
We're gonna make se that this
place is filled to capacity.

03:31.157 --> 03:32.587
500 people? Yeah.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.842
That beats the hell out of
the 50 we usually play for.

03:34.843 --> 03:35.503
No kidding.

03:35.504 --> 03:37.224
And I'm lining up a meeting
with Dominic Wells,

03:37.225 --> 03:38.924
the president of cascade heights records.

03:38.925 --> 03:41.562
Dude, he is big in Atlanta.

03:41.563 --> 03:43.586
Domino is big everywhere,

03:43.587 --> 03:45.453
and he's looking to sign new acts.

03:46.036 --> 03:48.221
Wow. That's... that's cool. That's great.

03:48.915 --> 03:50.573
So why aren't you more excited?

03:51.652 --> 03:52.347
I am.

03:52.348 --> 03:53.941
Really? Yeah.

03:54.204 --> 03:55.991
It's just, you know, Scarlett's been

03:55.992 --> 03:58.145
to every dive bar we've ever played,

03:58.440 --> 03:59.767
now when we're someplace like this,

03:59.768 --> 04:02.386
just... feels weird without her.

04:02.387 --> 04:04.077
So put her on the guest list.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.726
But if you want the prize, you
gotta keep your eyes on it.

04:09.258 --> 04:10.229
Yeah.

04:11.191 --> 04:12.161
I know.

04:18.983 --> 04:20.805
How long does he expect me to wait?

04:20.807 --> 04:22.354
He's not running a country.

04:23.608 --> 04:25.281
Five more minutes, and I'm gone.

04:25.354 --> 04:26.735
Look, here he is.

04:26.736 --> 04:27.721
Juliette.

04:28.591 --> 04:29.426
Glenn. Marshall.

04:29.427 --> 04:31.044
How are ya? Thanks for coming.

04:31.045 --> 04:34.176
We're gonna make a few changes
to the lineup at the Ryman.

04:35.128 --> 04:36.777
Xx

04:36.778 --> 04:38.805
we're only gonna have you do one song.

04:39.656 --> 04:42.023
Ex... have you lost your mind?

04:42.024 --> 04:43.494
One song for the artist

04:43.495 --> 04:46.014
that's gone multiplatinum
twice for this label

04:46.015 --> 04:47.474
in the past three years?

04:47.475 --> 04:48.480
There's no denying

04:48.481 --> 04:50.428
you've been a tremendous boon to the label.

04:50.429 --> 04:53.324
But within the music community
and certainly in the public eye,

04:53.325 --> 04:56.184
there's a perception that
you're... wildly successful?

04:56.185 --> 04:58.930
Look, legends have played
the Ryman stage...

04:58.931 --> 05:00.531
xx

04:59.136 --> 05:01.675
people with long and storied careers.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.417
And considering the brevity of
yours and your recent troubles,

05:04.418 --> 05:06.496
I would say that you... I have
kept this label relevant

05:06.497 --> 05:08.460
and made you a lot of money.
Juliette, hold on.

05:08.461 --> 05:09.624
You, too.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.782
There's no question that
Edgehill believes in you.

05:12.783 --> 05:14.636
Xx

05:12.783 --> 05:15.082
but in order for us to protect
our investment, we need...

05:15.083 --> 05:17.494
no, I'm not an investment.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.524
I'm an artist... your top-earning one...

05:20.525 --> 05:22.714
and I deserve to at least close the show.

05:22.715 --> 05:23.717
You will...

05:24.348 --> 05:25.573
Just not alone.

05:25.740 --> 05:27.659
We're all judged by the company we keep,

05:27.660 --> 05:29.733
and in front of the
industry's heavyweights,

05:30.647 --> 05:32.011
I think you'd benefit by performing

05:32.012 --> 05:34.583
with someone who's viewed
with tremendous respect.

05:35.516 --> 05:36.758
Rayna Jaymes.

05:37.882 --> 05:38.854
What?!

05:39.439 --> 05:42.986
Daphne, do not stand there.
That is bad for your eyes.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.155
And anyway, a watched pot never boils.

05:45.156 --> 05:47.937
It's not a pot, mom. And
it's popping, not boiling.

05:47.938 --> 05:48.474
Ohh, excuse me.

05:48.475 --> 05:50.465
So is dad gonna be home for movie night?

05:50.466 --> 05:51.884
I hope so. He wouldn't miss it!

05:51.885 --> 05:52.990
Daddy! Come here.

05:52.991 --> 05:56.564
Okay, so comedy, Sci-Fi,
action, or chick flick?

05:56.565 --> 05:57.527
Documentary?

05:57.528 --> 05:58.582
No! Boring.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.658
All right, girls, go get us set up.

06:00.968 --> 06:03.590
Okay. Oh. Popcorn!

06:03.591 --> 06:04.769
Coming up!

06:05.095 --> 06:05.997
And how are you doing?

06:05.998 --> 06:07.320
You know, I'm good.

06:07.603 --> 06:09.567
Started working on a new track today,

06:09.568 --> 06:11.091
getting ready for that anniversary show

06:11.092 --> 06:12.477
we're doing this week...

06:13.075 --> 06:14.851
Having movie night with my family.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.079
Life is good...

06:16.211 --> 06:17.730
Except, of course, Marshall Evans.

06:17.731 --> 06:19.134
Why? Is he not liking your new song?

06:19.135 --> 06:22.345
Oh, you know, he's just a big
proponent for the status quo.

06:22.464 --> 06:24.092
Unless, of, you have even
the slightest downturn,

06:24.093 --> 06:25.870
in which case he'll just throw
you to the wolves entirely.

06:25.871 --> 06:27.277
Yep. Sounds like politics.

06:27.278 --> 06:28.984
Mm-hmm. How's it going?

06:29.999 --> 06:31.202
My numbers are way up.

06:31.203 --> 06:32.637
Good. Mm-hmm.

06:34.178 --> 06:35.148
Hello?

06:35.254 --> 06:38.125
Teddy, I'd like to speak
with you privately.

06:38.355 --> 06:39.340
Coleman?

06:39.650 --> 06:40.606
Yeah.

06:40.996 --> 06:42.349
Candidate to candidate.

06:42.595 --> 06:44.381
Can you come down and
meet me at the Riverwalk?

06:45.938 --> 06:47.533
Sure. When were you thinkin'?

06:47.587 --> 06:50.397
Now. It's important, Teddy.

06:50.756 --> 06:51.710
Okay.

06:52.403 --> 06:53.436
What'd he want?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.860
He wants to talk to me tonight.

06:56.979 --> 06:57.775
About what?

06:57.776 --> 06:59.967
I don't know, but, uh,
ever since the arrest,

06:59.968 --> 07:02.569
there's been some rumblings
about the viability of his run.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.698
Well, you gotta go, right?

07:06.576 --> 07:07.642
I'm sorry.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.763
It's okay.

07:09.193 --> 07:10.755
I won't be long. Okay.

07:11.401 --> 07:13.625
Girls, I gotta run out. I'm sorry.
I'll be back.

07:13.626 --> 07:16.147
All right, girls! Chick flick!

07:16.493 --> 07:20.430
Xx

08:06.669 --> 08:08.328
Hey, you okay?

08:09.327 --> 08:10.313
Yeah.

08:11.614 --> 08:14.328
Just never realized how sad
my Uncle's songs were before.

08:15.878 --> 08:18.257
It just seems that way 'cause
you're going through a breakup.

08:19.128 --> 08:20.099
Maybe.

08:21.644 --> 08:24.390
Doesn't help that Avery's
posters are all over town.

08:25.092 --> 08:26.671
I've never missed one of his shows.

08:26.672 --> 08:30.050
You've gone and twisted yourself
into a pretzel supporting that guy.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.755
You dumped him because...

08:32.168 --> 08:33.583
He didn't repay the favor.

08:33.671 --> 08:35.813
I dumped him 'cause he went
over to that woman's house,

08:35.815 --> 08:37.967
knowing full well he might
have to sleep with her.

08:38.215 --> 08:39.360
He didn't.

08:39.943 --> 08:41.393
At least, he said he didn't.

08:42.842 --> 08:45.365
What if I've just made the
biggest mistake of my life?

08:45.372 --> 08:47.622
Maybe you should follow his
lead and write about it.

08:53.207 --> 08:55.969
Oh, Gunnar, I know we
haven't written lately...

08:59.379 --> 09:00.829
It's just not there.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.437
Sorry.

09:14.158 --> 09:15.304
Any luck?

09:16.330 --> 09:17.381
Nope.

09:17.947 --> 09:20.405
She just needs help healing the wound.

09:20.651 --> 09:21.845
Leave it to me.

09:29.454 --> 09:30.795
Coleman. Teddy.

09:33.152 --> 09:36.384
You know, Rayna and Tandy
are like sisters to me.

09:36.385 --> 09:38.649
Lamar was never like a father, but, uh,

09:39.151 --> 09:41.001
I did learn a lot from him.

09:41.359 --> 09:44.393
He's very effective silencing his enemies.

09:44.607 --> 09:45.958
I'm not sure what you're implying,

09:45.959 --> 09:48.489
but I hope you didn't drag me
anyway from my family tonight

09:48.490 --> 09:50.260
just so we can compare notes.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.852
I'm here to discuss a withdrawal.

09:54.856 --> 09:55.938
Yours.

09:56.903 --> 09:59.425
What? What do you mean mine?

10:03.863 --> 10:06.583
What the hell is this? You had me followed?

10:06.584 --> 10:07.523
Like I said, I learned a lot.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.963
These are meaningless and
completely out of context.

10:09.964 --> 10:11.478
She is just a friend.

10:11.564 --> 10:13.223
Drop out the race, Teddy.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.974
You have until the weekend to decide.

10:16.141 --> 10:19.067
After that, these get leaked to the press.

10:19.068 --> 10:20.518
You'd really do that?

10:21.452 --> 10:22.695
There is no affair.

10:22.696 --> 10:25.681
You know what, Teddy? I believe you.

10:26.935 --> 10:28.962
I just don't think anybody else will.

10:49.590 --> 10:52.977
Why on earth would they put me
up onstage with that woman?

10:53.256 --> 10:55.249
Personally, I think it's a great idea.

10:56.150 --> 10:57.523
Her husband's about to become mayor.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.694
She's a living legend. It's all good cred.

10:59.695 --> 11:01.167
Oh, come on. "Living legend"?

11:01.168 --> 11:04.057
That's just a fancy of
saying "past her prime."

11:04.058 --> 11:05.790
Marshall wants it to look like

11:05.791 --> 11:07.919
Rayna is taking you under her wing,

11:07.920 --> 11:09.482
like she's... like what?

11:10.255 --> 11:12.137
Like she approves of me?

11:13.167 --> 11:16.378
I don't need anybody else's wings, okay?

11:16.399 --> 11:19.369
I've done this all on my own,
and I plan to keep it that way.

11:21.024 --> 11:23.272
Then in addition to not having a tour,

11:23.567 --> 11:24.352
you won't be performing

11:24.353 --> 11:26.229
at the most revered venue in this town

11:26.230 --> 11:28.590
for the biggest musical event of the year.

11:28.591 --> 11:30.361
Is that what you want?

11:36.990 --> 11:39.949
Her husband is 15 years older than her,

11:39.950 --> 11:41.259
works in a foreign country

11:41.260 --> 11:43.845
while she volunteers for your campaign.

11:44.251 --> 11:47.395
There's no getting around it.
This looks bad.

11:47.396 --> 11:48.703
I don't know how you could do this, Teddy.

11:48.704 --> 11:51.967
What are you talking about?
Peggy has always pined for you.

11:51.968 --> 11:53.679
Why do you think she helped
you secure that loan?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.350
Look, I didn't do anything wrong,

11:55.351 --> 11:56.186
but there is no way

11:56.187 --> 11:58.252
I'm gonna subject my wife
or daughters to this...

11:58.253 --> 12:00.050
the photographs, the speculation.

12:00.051 --> 12:02.290
Unfortunately, it's too late for that.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.130
Now Coleman's always
been a man of his word,

12:04.131 --> 12:07.287
but I can guarantee you that
these pictures are gonna surface

12:07.288 --> 12:09.024
whether you drop out of this race or not.

12:09.025 --> 12:10.003
Oh, come on. What are you suggesting?

12:10.004 --> 12:11.712
That I just sit back and let it happen?

12:11.713 --> 12:15.210
No, no. What I'm suggesting
is that you come clean.

12:15.297 --> 12:19.296
Are or were you having an
affair with Peggy Kenter?

12:19.297 --> 12:20.378
No.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.828
Then the photos can be explained.

12:22.930 --> 12:26.379
You simply tell them as much
of the truth as you need to.

12:27.281 --> 12:29.275
What about the credit union connection?

12:29.313 --> 12:30.537
If I say there's no affair,

12:30.538 --> 12:32.822
what makes you think that Coleman
is not gonna go digging around,

12:32.823 --> 12:34.405
looking for whatever else it might be?

12:34.406 --> 12:37.863
Teddy, that paper trail
has been wiped clean.

12:37.864 --> 12:42.972
Now as I see it, the larger
problem here is Rayna.

12:44.690 --> 12:46.574
You need to get rid of Peggy.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.868
So who are you gonna tell first?

13:03.096 --> 13:04.914
Oh! Damn it.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.018
Thank you.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.787
All right. Look. Hey!

13:09.849 --> 13:11.059
You're driving me crazy, girl, all right?

13:11.060 --> 13:12.535
You can't put something down two minutes

13:12.536 --> 13:14.174
without you washin' it and puttin' it away.

13:14.175 --> 13:15.529
Sorry. Come here. Sit down.

13:17.343 --> 13:19.516
Rule number one... when
a relationship ends,

13:19.517 --> 13:21.287
you gotta get out of the damn house.

13:21.309 --> 13:22.734
All right, I don't care what
you do or where you go,

13:22.735 --> 13:25.625
you just cannot sit around
here, being lonely, doing...

13:25.935 --> 13:26.953
This.

13:27.088 --> 13:28.329
I'm-a put you and Gunnar on the list

13:28.330 --> 13:29.542
for the Edgehill anniversary show.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.831
That's really kind of you,
but I really don't feel...

13:31.832 --> 13:33.135
I can't wait.

13:33.136 --> 13:34.169
Good.

13:35.472 --> 13:36.357
If you're house band leader,

13:36.358 --> 13:38.803
does that mean you play in everybody's act?

13:38.804 --> 13:39.774
Yep.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.711
Even Rayna's?

13:43.477 --> 13:44.558
Yep.

13:45.460 --> 13:47.386
Is it gonna be hard for
you, seeing her again,

13:47.387 --> 13:49.045
since you quit the band?

13:49.883 --> 13:51.253
I'll be just fine.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.389
And I was fired.

13:57.676 --> 13:58.650
Well, not the first day.

13:58.651 --> 13:59.936
No, I guess...

13:59.937 --> 14:01.055
The very end.

14:01.056 --> 14:02.594
Hey, you guys! Hey there, Rayna.

14:02.595 --> 14:04.062
How you doin'?!

14:04.179 --> 14:05.766
This is Liam McGuinnis.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.146
He'll be joining us. Hey, guys.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.293
Hi, girls.

14:10.223 --> 14:12.542
Um, I think we're gonna
start with "already gone."

14:12.543 --> 14:14.149
I haven't quite figured
out the rest of it yet,

14:14.150 --> 14:15.729
but we'll get on that.

14:16.187 --> 14:17.457
Hey. Hey.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.338
I wondered if you were gonna be here.
I wasn't sure.

14:20.339 --> 14:22.384
Yeah, they got me leading the house band.

14:22.385 --> 14:25.403
Of course they do. Best of the best, right?

14:25.505 --> 14:26.479
How you doin'?

14:26.480 --> 14:28.943
Good. How you been?

14:28.944 --> 14:30.988
Can't complain, so I won't.

14:32.466 --> 14:33.930
You working with this guy now, huh?

14:34.241 --> 14:35.127
I am.

14:35.128 --> 14:36.915
Bit of a wild card, I heard.

14:37.192 --> 14:39.071
Sometimes I like to mix it up, you know.

14:39.072 --> 14:40.050
Yes, you do.

14:40.051 --> 14:42.914
Mr. Claybourne, big fan. Liam McGuinnis.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.882
Thank you. Yeah, nice to meet you.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.029
Same here.

14:46.403 --> 14:47.773
I'm gonna get to it.

14:49.715 --> 14:50.739
Tremendous talent.

14:50.740 --> 14:53.443
I never understood why he
didn't pursue a solo career.

14:53.444 --> 14:54.669
Ms. Jaymes.

14:55.844 --> 14:58.143
Hey, Marshall. How are you?

14:59.139 --> 15:01.651
You guys come down to talk about
how we're gonna close the show?

15:01.652 --> 15:03.310
Oh, I don't care which song closes,

15:03.311 --> 15:05.179
but I do care who you perform it with.

15:05.180 --> 15:07.349
All right, well, I'll go get set up.

15:08.431 --> 15:10.133
Marshall, come on now.

15:10.331 --> 15:11.862
I'd like you to do a duet

15:12.074 --> 15:15.242
to help bolster the reputation
of a fellow Edgehill artist.

15:15.243 --> 15:16.229
Who?

15:17.898 --> 15:19.145
Are you kidding me?!

15:19.146 --> 15:20.773
We've been through this. The answer's no.

15:20.774 --> 15:22.705
It's not a request.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.300
Well, I don't take orders.

15:24.301 --> 15:27.127
Then I'll be releasing your
greatest hits album immediately.

15:28.669 --> 15:30.327
Like hell you will.

15:42.033 --> 15:44.475
It's blackmail. That's what it is.

15:45.648 --> 15:50.063
I mean, he... just continues
to threaten me with extinction

15:50.064 --> 15:51.833
if I don't work with this girl,

15:51.921 --> 15:53.509
and he keeps threatening me
with a greatest hits album.

15:53.510 --> 15:56.017
It's the same
passive-aggressive maneuvering

15:56.018 --> 15:57.534
that prompted me to take a leak

15:57.535 --> 15:59.897
into one of Mr. Evans' potted plants.

16:00.078 --> 16:01.113
Seriously.

16:02.911 --> 16:05.214
Oh, man. What do you think
about Juliette Barnes?

16:05.215 --> 16:07.609
Nice rack. Okay voice.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.935
Uh, packaged to a tee
for 14 year olds. Yeah.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.715
Is there anything there? Anything?

16:11.716 --> 16:13.476
Well, she sells a lot of records.

16:13.477 --> 16:14.970
She knows how to play the game.

16:14.971 --> 16:17.126
She does. She knows how to play the game.

16:17.127 --> 16:18.962
Sometimes that's what it takes.

16:19.928 --> 16:25.334
You know what? I am so sick
of this greatest hits threat.

16:25.335 --> 16:27.146
Hey, buck, all right, so listen.

16:27.147 --> 16:28.167
Call up Marshall Evans.

16:28.168 --> 16:31.271
Tell him if I'm gonna save
Juliette Barnes' public image,

16:31.272 --> 16:32.961
he is going to owe me.

16:32.962 --> 16:36.142
If I'm gonna do this duet, the
next record I do on Edgehill

16:36.143 --> 16:39.567
is gonna be my own music produced by Liam,

16:39.568 --> 16:41.042
and I don't ever wanna hear another word

16:41.043 --> 16:43.550
about this greatest hits
album unless it's my idea.

16:45.043 --> 16:47.374
All right. All right. Let me know. Bye.

16:49.427 --> 16:50.574
Playing the game.

16:50.853 --> 16:52.222
Manipulation.

16:53.028 --> 16:54.365
Negotiation.

17:08.983 --> 17:10.787
All the greats have been through here.

17:10.983 --> 17:12.657
Must have been amazing.

17:13.512 --> 17:14.707
Still is.

17:15.336 --> 17:16.568
I had a meeting with the sound tech.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.603
Why are you here?

17:18.935 --> 17:21.715
I just wanted to see it, see it from here.

17:22.713 --> 17:24.612
I've only ever sat in the audience.

17:25.048 --> 17:25.959
Wasn't that long ago

17:25.960 --> 17:28.402
I was getting off the bus from Alabama.

17:32.457 --> 17:34.963
Everybody thinks I'm
just a flash in the pan.

17:37.353 --> 17:39.316
Well, this is the place to prove 'em wrong.

17:39.317 --> 17:41.055
Yeah. With a duet?

17:42.358 --> 17:44.256
With Rayna Jaymes? Yes.

17:46.551 --> 17:47.615
You know, if you'd quit fighting it,

17:47.616 --> 17:49.420
there's a lot you could learn from her.

17:50.112 --> 17:50.926
Yeah, well,

17:50.927 --> 17:53.374
there are a few a things she
could learn from me, too.

17:57.115 --> 17:58.437
You can do this.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.261
I know.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.438
I'll see ya at rehearsal.

18:21.956 --> 18:22.896
What are you doing here?

18:22.897 --> 18:25.360
I am picking you up and dusting you off.

18:25.361 --> 18:28.763
The best way to get over someone
is to get under someone else.

18:34.704 --> 18:36.467
Hey, guys. You ready to get started?

18:36.468 --> 18:38.333
Been ready for 20 minutes.

18:38.416 --> 18:40.234
Okay, well, we're all here now.

18:40.239 --> 18:42.810
It's my fault. Ran a little
late this morning...

18:42.811 --> 18:44.178
No thanks to last night.

18:44.179 --> 18:45.542
You're Liam McGuinnis, right?

18:45.543 --> 18:46.501
Yeah.

18:46.502 --> 18:48.260
I've heard some good things about you.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.620
Then somebody was lying.

18:49.621 --> 18:52.383
All right, y'all got a song
picked out for this duet?

18:52.581 --> 18:55.150
Yeah, I've got some song ideas.
I'm sure you do, too,

18:55.151 --> 18:57.343
so we can just... well, then
we'll get out of your way.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.555
We'll get you set up.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.418
By the way,

19:05.512 --> 19:07.771
I'm not sure what deal
you and Marshall made

19:07.772 --> 19:09.977
that makes you willing to walk
in here and act all nice,

19:09.978 --> 19:11.844
but let me save you the trouble.

19:12.010 --> 19:14.314
I'm willing to do this duet, no problem,

19:14.315 --> 19:15.483
as long as we skip over the part

19:15.484 --> 19:17.669
where we act like we
actually like each other.

19:18.108 --> 19:19.029
Deal?

19:21.035 --> 19:22.918
You do what you gotta do, kiddo.

19:24.924 --> 19:26.101
Hey, guys.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.505
I never wear these things.
I cannot feel my feet.

19:40.506 --> 19:43.000
Just gotta get used to 'em. Come on.
Let's get drinks.

19:47.718 --> 19:49.616
56300:26: 00:26:26,684 Tequila shots. Wow.

19:52.004 --> 19:53.039
How you doing?

19:53.365 --> 19:54.676
Good. You?

19:54.677 --> 19:56.127
Better now that you're here.

19:56.677 --> 19:58.571
Care to dance? Uh...

19:58.572 --> 19:59.814
She'd love to.

Well, I just think that

20:26.402 --> 20:28.046
I think I know how to close a show.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.999
Okay, then why don't we look for a song

20:30.000 --> 20:31.839
that gets 'em all the way up in the balcony

20:31.840 --> 20:32.941
instead of a ballad that
puts them to sleep?

20:32.942 --> 20:35.518
We might be differing about
what gets them in the balcony.

20:35.519 --> 20:38.025
My fans are looking for an exciting show.

20:38.026 --> 20:39.782
I understand that. Why
do you think I'm here?

20:39.783 --> 20:40.745
Same reason we're all here.

20:40.746 --> 20:43.252
It just also has to be
something that is authentic.

20:43.253 --> 20:45.189
You should be happy that I'm even here

20:45.190 --> 20:46.817
to expand your fan base.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.782
I thought we were here
because you've got fans

20:48.783 --> 20:50.893
whose parents don't want 'em
looking up to a shoplifter.

20:50.894 --> 20:52.366
Okay, okay. That's what Marshall told me.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.203
Shut up. It's one song, all right?

20:54.204 --> 20:57.304
Surely to God, the two of you
can come together on one song!

21:01.936 --> 21:03.855
I'm really sorry to have
to do this over the phone,

21:03.856 --> 21:07.502
but it's... it's best that we're not
seen together. I thought we'd

21:07.503 --> 21:09.515
gotten through the worst of this
when the audit was stopped.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.553
I know. I know. Well, I don't understand

21:11.554 --> 21:13.742
why this can't also be stopped.

21:14.177 --> 21:17.326
Because it's in the hands

21:17.682 --> 21:19.634
and he will do whatever it
takes to bring me down,

21:19.635 --> 21:21.217
even if it means a smear campaign

21:21.218 --> 21:23.262
based on a few innocent photographs.

21:25.668 --> 21:26.557
I think

21:27.009 --> 21:29.133
that's it's best that you
tell Robert what's happening.

21:29.406 --> 21:31.767
But, look, the good news is, you can say

21:31.768 --> 21:34.429
with all honesty that there is
absolutely nothing going on

21:34.430 --> 21:35.754
between us romantically.

21:38.015 --> 21:39.194
Yeah, well, that's true.

21:39.944 --> 21:42.467
You just need to be prepared to
tell everyone else that, too.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.192
You got me up dancing. That's something.

23:50.246 --> 23:51.282
Hey. What the hell?

23:52.230 --> 23:53.025
Is this...

23:53.726 --> 23:55.785
I'm sorry. I didn't know
she had a boyfriend.

23:55.925 --> 23:57.542
I don't have a boyfriend. He's not...

23:58.986 --> 24:00.181
what are you doing? Me?

24:00.202 --> 24:01.967

24:03.222 --> 24:04.293
I wasn't hooking up.

24:04.294 --> 24:06.693
I thought I was supposed to
relax and let loose. I...

24:06.694 --> 24:08.642
Well, I didn't think you'd be that loose.
There y'all are.

24:11.382 --> 24:13.363
What's wrong? Everything.

I just don't think that's the right song.

24:26.860 --> 24:29.371
You know I've been writing
a lot of great new stuff.

24:29.372 --> 24:32.253
Maybe it'd be exciting to do
something new and different.

24:32.254 --> 24:33.946
No, no, no. I don't wanna take a chance

24:34.078 --> 24:36.155
on one of your completely untested songs.

24:36.192 --> 24:38.430
Okay, I've got songs that have
gone multiplatinum, and you

24:38.431 --> 24:39.451
still don't think they're good

24:39.452 --> 24:41.354
enough to play here. It's
not that I don't think

24:41.355 --> 24:42.441
that they're good enough to do here.

24:42.442 --> 24:44.792
It's just that the Ryman
stage is a place where

24:44.793 --> 24:46.413
Tammy Wynette has played... I know.

24:46.414 --> 24:49.007
And patsy cline, and people
go there to make history.

24:49.008 --> 24:50.763
That's how we should be
thinking about this.

24:50.927 --> 24:52.426
We could edge up a classic.

24:52.431 --> 24:55.147
Oh, there's an original idea.

24:55.148 --> 24:56.969
He's trying to help.

24:57.531 --> 24:58.968
By doing what?

24:59.115 --> 25:00.619
I could have written three songs

25:00.620 --> 25:01.787
in the time we've been sitting here

25:01.788 --> 25:04.599
listening to you reminisce
about your glory days...

25:04.668 --> 25:07.163
the days where you didn't need
me to help you fill seats.

25:07.164 --> 25:09.255
Let's be clear about somethin' right now.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.927
You are gonna be on that
stage because of me.

25:12.219 --> 25:15.239
All right? I am doing this as a favor

25:15.323 --> 25:17.784
for the label that I helped create.

25:17.787 --> 25:19.564
You have not earned that place at all,

25:19.565 --> 25:21.079
and everybody here knows it.

25:38.191 --> 25:39.114
That was bad.

25:39.116 --> 25:41.050
Girl seriously needs to get laid.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.078
That is so not her problem.

25:43.079 --> 25:43.937
Okay.

25:45.874 --> 25:47.745
Look, ray, I get it. Y'all two don't mix,

25:47.746 --> 25:49.744
and she's not exactly miss manners,

25:49.745 --> 25:51.410
but I'll tell you what. There's
somethin' there, all right?

25:51.411 --> 25:52.927
And she sure as hell didn't deserve that.

25:52.928 --> 25:54.049
I'll tell you somethin' else, too.

25:54.050 --> 25:55.762
You don't remember back
when you were starting out,

25:55.763 --> 25:57.296
people said you weren't
traditional country enough?

25:57.297 --> 25:59.041
'Cause I do remember. You hated it.

25:59.042 --> 26:01.245
Man, she sure got you whipped, doesn't she?

26:01.592 --> 26:03.277
Let's just get one thing real clear.

26:03.278 --> 26:04.984
What's that? It's just as simple as this.

26:04.985 --> 26:06.716
I don't believe in that music.

26:08.945 --> 26:09.886
It's called "undermine."

26:09.887 --> 26:12.025
I wrote the first verse.
She wrote the rest of it.

26:12.026 --> 26:13.306
You listen to this. You tell me

26:13.307 --> 26:15.639
that girl doesn't have it in
her to be a great songwriter.

27:28.103 --> 27:29.517
It's not the right time for this.

27:29.518 --> 27:30.477
What are you talking about?

27:30.478 --> 27:32.507
I just... I think we should wait.

27:33.903 --> 27:34.878
Wait for what?

27:37.666 --> 27:38.493
Just...

27:40.290 --> 27:42.157
I'm just not into casual sex.

27:43.702 --> 27:44.498
That's all.

27:44.841 --> 27:45.910
Are you kidding me?

27:46.700 --> 27:47.464
No.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.786
You got about 20 tattoos,
and you won't have sex?

27:50.787 --> 27:52.039
It's not that I don't want to.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.668
I mean, you're beautiful, but I-I...

27:53.704 --> 27:55.252
so this is really fake, isn't it?

27:55.768 --> 27:58.140
Look, I like you... oh. A lot.

27:58.141 --> 27:59.680
But it's... it's all for appearances?

27:59.783 --> 28:01.526
No. That's... that's not what I mean.

28:01.527 --> 28:02.515
Are you gay? Oh.

28:03.289 --> 28:06.276
Is that why you agreed to this?
Because you needed a skirt?

28:06.277 --> 28:07.236
Hold on. Hold on.

28:07.237 --> 28:09.680
How do you get to gay from me
wanting to take things slow?

28:10.069 --> 28:11.396
Let's talk about this.

28:11.397 --> 28:13.602
No, I am not gonna talk about it anymore.

28:14.070 --> 28:15.557
All right, this was never
gonna work anyway.

28:15.558 --> 28:16.709

haven't talked about anything.

Please go.

29:21.911 --> 29:22.691
Hey.

29:23.894 --> 29:24.867
Hey.

29:25.230 --> 29:26.163
May I come in?

29:27.921 --> 29:28.954
Great. Thanks.

29:30.044 --> 29:31.050
Beautiful house.

29:34.174 --> 29:36.922
So... I think we need to start over,

29:37.310 --> 29:39.501
and I don't think any of those
songs that we were looking at

29:39.502 --> 29:42.297
are the right thing, so I think
there's just one solution.

29:43.598 --> 29:44.858
Okay, and what's that?

29:45.091 --> 29:46.077
We need to write it.

29:46.362 --> 29:47.719
You want to write with me?

29:47.786 --> 29:50.759
Nope, but I think that's
what we're gonna have to do,

29:50.875 --> 29:54.665
so, uh, let's just set our minds to it.

29:54.666 --> 29:56.426
We've agreed to this situation.

29:56.427 --> 29:59.016
We are going to suck it
up and be pros about it

29:59.017 --> 30:00.006
and get it done.

30:00.884 --> 30:01.985
Do you have coffee?

30:09.523 --> 30:12.494
So you spoke with Peggy. How did she react?

30:12.495 --> 30:14.250
Not well. She was pretty upset.

30:15.759 --> 30:16.587
Well, you know,

30:17.151 --> 30:19.963
if she was unstable at all,
we... we could use that.

30:19.964 --> 30:20.744
What?

30:22.079 --> 30:23.144
She's fine.

30:23.543 --> 30:27.105
All I'm saying is, if she
had any personal problems,

30:27.106 --> 30:28.512
anything with her husband,

30:28.835 --> 30:31.998
it could explain her seeking
you out for counsel,

30:32.226 --> 30:34.418
rather than the other way around.

30:34.419 --> 30:36.672
I mean, we wouldn't want anybody to think

30:37.426 --> 30:39.458
that there was any sort of
trouble with your marriage.

30:39.459 --> 30:40.398
Well, there isn't.

30:42.403 --> 30:43.551
Ah. Does Rayna know

30:43.747 --> 30:46.146
about the loan you secured
on the cumberland deal?

30:46.614 --> 30:48.433
No. Good. You keep it that way.

30:48.816 --> 30:51.294
Now as to this other situation,

30:51.295 --> 30:53.050
I've been giving it some further thought,

30:54.287 --> 30:57.422
and I think that the
correct way to handle this

30:57.423 --> 30:58.604
is just simply to...

30:59.519 --> 31:00.540
Keep feeding...

31:01.567 --> 31:03.340
The voracious news cycle.

31:03.903 --> 31:04.683
With?

31:11.837 --> 31:13.976
I thought the charges against
him were gonna be dropped.

31:14.107 --> 31:14.983
They were.

31:15.979 --> 31:19.004
But I thought a phone call
to a friend was in order.

31:19.157 --> 31:21.141
I mean, possession is a felony after all

31:21.142 --> 31:22.262
and should be taken seriously,

31:22.263 --> 31:25.094
particularly by our political leaders.

31:25.095 --> 31:27.282
Come on, lamar. You and I both
know those weren't his drugs.

31:27.607 --> 31:29.509
Coleman has been sober over 20 years,

31:29.510 --> 31:31.075
and he's been a longtime sponsor.

31:31.314 --> 31:34.062
Then he can fight it in
court, and he'll likely win,

31:34.914 --> 31:37.230
but the election will be over by then.

31:43.226 --> 31:45.626
No, I think we have to
let the verse breathe.

31:45.627 --> 31:47.260
Yeah, but the chorus is the hook,

31:47.261 --> 31:48.779
and we have to get to the hook fast.

31:48.780 --> 31:50.507
No, we don't. What's the hurry?

31:50.508 --> 31:52.297
Seriously, what's the rush?

31:52.299 --> 31:54.651
Okay. Fine. Fine. We'll
just extend the verse.

31:54.652 --> 31:55.480
Okay.

31:57.947 --> 31:59.512
This song about Deacon for you?

31:59.949 --> 32:01.223
Not necessarily.

32:03.292 --> 32:04.169
How about for you?

32:06.603 --> 32:07.544
All of 'em.

32:10.091 --> 32:11.563
So after the second verse,

32:11.564 --> 32:13.816
I think we should go out
on a double chorus.

32:13.820 --> 32:14.743
No bridge?

32:15.179 --> 32:16.539
We're gonna have a 6-minute song.

32:16.540 --> 32:17.960
I think we have to have a bridge.

32:21.019 --> 32:22.456
Do you have any orange juice?

32:23.420 --> 32:24.584
I got some vodka.

32:28.345 --> 32:29.574
You think they're still alive?

32:31.386 --> 32:32.214
Hard to say.

32:33.929 --> 32:35.893
I wouldn't want to get
in between those two.

32:37.975 --> 32:38.865
Actually...

32:39.653 --> 32:40.566
I would.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.722
Suit up, boys. We got some work to do.

32:43.126 --> 32:44.241
You got somethin' for us?

32:44.774 --> 32:46.081
We're about to find out.

33:01.774 --> 33:03.081
This is Dominic Wells,

33:03.341 --> 33:05.500
the man behind cascade heights records.

33:05.501 --> 33:07.917
Domino, I want you to meet the
one and only Avery Barkley.

33:07.918 --> 33:09.003
How you doing, partner?

33:09.310 --> 33:12.074
Marilyn... she sing your praises
like the church choir.

33:12.130 --> 33:13.500
She say you fixing to blow up.

33:13.501 --> 33:15.080
It's a real honor, Mr. Wells.

33:15.081 --> 33:16.006
Just call me "domino."

33:16.570 --> 33:17.725
All right. Domino.

33:17.726 --> 33:19.501
I just signed Avery and
his band, and he is.

33:19.502 --> 33:22.810
He's the future, and he's
got a voice, domino.

33:23.231 --> 33:25.418
You'd like it. Be worth your time.

33:27.846 --> 33:29.916
You know, we, uh, we just
brought the house down

33:29.917 --> 33:31.676
at Tequila cowboy the other night.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.311
You know, you should come
hear me play this Friday.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.362
And I wish I could.

33:34.398 --> 33:36.655
But listen, I gotta catch
the plane to Atlanta.

33:36.656 --> 33:38.392
Why don't you come to A.T.L.?

33:38.393 --> 33:41.465
Come to the "a" so I can show
you how we get down in the "a."

33:41.466 --> 33:43.779
♪Rock 'n' roll♪

33:54.818 --> 33:56.030
Tried to call you earlier.

33:57.825 --> 33:58.653
Because?

33:59.220 --> 34:01.056
I wanted to see if you
were available tomorrow,

34:01.586 --> 34:02.462
to write.

34:04.883 --> 34:05.887
I mean, uh...

34:07.634 --> 34:08.478
Yeah.

34:09.728 --> 34:10.813
Yeah, I'd love to.

34:11.777 --> 34:13.886
I just didn't know if you'd
ever want to see me again.

34:17.585 --> 34:19.071
Well, actually, I wanted to thank you.

34:20.594 --> 34:22.126
You changed my life...

34:23.346 --> 34:24.606
That night at the bluebird.

34:26.963 --> 34:29.085
And if I'm gonna lose someone,
I'd glad it's not you.

34:34.290 --> 34:35.293
Nice shoes.

34:38.610 --> 34:39.710
Ryman auditorium.

34:41.428 --> 34:43.007
Only took you three years to get here.

34:44.690 --> 34:45.935
You should be proud of yourself.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.710
Can I have a minute by myself, please?

34:53.434 --> 34:54.375
Yeah.

35:02.832 --> 35:04.474
Guys, I need a minute, please.

35:09.123 --> 35:10.032
Wow.

35:10.857 --> 35:12.983
Uh, you look... wow.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.166
What are you doing here?

35:27.178 --> 35:29.447
Look, I just... I want you to know that...

35:30.954 --> 35:34.454
I would like nothing more
than to make love to you,

35:34.685 --> 35:37.068
but I respect any woman too much to do that

35:37.069 --> 35:38.763
outside the confines of marriage,

35:40.092 --> 35:41.225
especially you.

35:42.765 --> 35:43.533
Really?

35:43.534 --> 35:46.698
I know that's weird and old-fashioned,

35:47.133 --> 35:49.225
but I'm willing to play
it any way you want to,

35:49.758 --> 35:52.618
including leaving you alone
if that's what you want.

35:53.951 --> 35:54.954
But what I want

35:56.062 --> 35:57.963
is just to really get to know you better.

35:58.481 --> 35:59.901
If you did, you...

36:00.480 --> 36:02.281
You wouldn't like me very much.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.978
It's too late.

36:19.162 --> 36:20.133
Trust me...

36:21.306 --> 36:22.341
I'm not gay.

36:25.494 --> 36:26.557

37:09.491 --> 37:11.327
you got the weight of the
world on your shoulders.

37:11.553 --> 37:13.238
Look, let's... let's talk about it later.

37:14.090 --> 37:14.885
You sure?

37:15.115 --> 37:16.423
Yeah, I'm sure. Come here.

37:19.215 --> 37:20.089
I love you.

37:20.323 --> 37:21.305
Love you, too.
