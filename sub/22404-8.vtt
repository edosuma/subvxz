on "Henry Danger"...

00:04.963 --> 00:06.214
- Ah! What--

00:06.297 --> 00:07.006
What happened to the lights?

00:07.090 --> 00:08.007
- When the electricity went out,

00:08.090 --> 00:10.927
Drex's containment unit
lost power!

00:11.010 --> 00:11.553

00:11.636 --> 00:14.139

00:29.863 --> 00:32.156
- Can you fix the Time Portal?!?

00:32.240 --> 00:34.200
- I could if we had
a little bit of zeridium.

00:36.786 --> 00:37.829
- Well, what year is this?

00:37.912 --> 00:39.581

has announced a recall

00:46.045 --> 00:47.422
after an investigation
revealed

00:47.505 --> 00:48.465
that the doll's
bright glow

00:48.548 --> 00:50.592
was powered by
radioactive zeridium.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.136
- You said you knew
where Piper's doll was buried.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.637
- Is that such a bad thing?

00:54.721 --> 00:56.139
To be wrong?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.183
- Today's national
"Take Your Kid To Work" Day.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.311
- That's why Drex came here!

01:01.394 --> 01:02.604
He's gonna try to stop me

01:02.687 --> 01:04.063
from going to work
with my dad,

01:04.147 --> 01:05.355
so I don't get densitized!

01:05.440 --> 01:06.149
- So you don't become
indestructible!

01:06.232 --> 01:08.151
- Which means no Captain Man...

01:08.234 --> 01:09.110
- No Kid Danger...

01:13.156 --> 01:14.073
- Okay Kid...

01:14.157 --> 01:15.325
here's the plan.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.493
- Go.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.660
- We leave here in a taxi cab,

01:17.744 --> 01:20.038
which will take us
to Glass Tech Industries,

01:20.121 --> 01:22.624
where my daddy works.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.000
- You are too old
to say "Daddy."

01:24.083 --> 01:26.002
- Well this is 1989, back
when I called him Daddy. So?

01:26.085 --> 01:28.046
- Mmmm well you
sound like a baby.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.339
- Okay how 'bout "Dad, dad!"

01:29.422 --> 01:30.006
{\an8}Can I call him
"Dad, dad, dad dad?!?"

01:30.089 --> 01:30.757
{\an8}Is that okay with you?

01:30.840 --> 01:33.593
{\an8}- Yes, yes please.

01:33.676 --> 01:34.761
- Okay!

01:34.844 --> 01:36.429
Now, Drex is most likely

01:36.513 --> 01:37.639
gonna try to locate
eight-year-old me,

01:37.722 --> 01:39.891
{\an8}and stop me before I skateboard
into the densitizer.

it a billion times.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.441

finished demonstrating

02:13.842 --> 02:17.262

became indestructible.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.182
Schwoz, have you found
enough money for us

02:21.266 --> 02:22.475
to take a cab to Glass Tech?

02:22.559 --> 02:25.645
- Yah.
I have 11 dollars...

02:25.728 --> 02:28.064
- All right.

02:28.147 --> 02:31.401
and this extra dollar
that I once used as a tissue.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.611

zeridium is still active!

find the "on" button...

11:00.993 --> 11:02.078
- I can see...
- Taken out of context...

11:02.161 --> 11:03.829
- Whatever!!!

11:03.913 --> 11:08.042
Now that I'm indestructible
and you're not...

11:08.125 --> 11:09.418
I'm gonna make sure
it stays that way.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.212
- Drex.
- Please.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.422
No, no, no.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.965
- Come on Drex,

11:16.342 --> 11:16.842
- D'ah, are you insane?!?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.763
- Ha ha ha!

11:30.981 --> 11:34.276
- Okay, I think I have
located Henry and Ray

11:34.360 --> 11:35.277
in the past.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.279
- Okay Drex...

11:37.363 --> 11:38.864
We're willing
to make a deal with you.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.366
- Oh are you?

11:40.449 --> 11:42.618
- Yeah.
You let us go

11:42.701 --> 11:44.412
and promise not to cause us
any more trouble...

11:44.495 --> 11:45.287
- Yeah?

11:45.371 --> 11:49.291
- And...
well...

11:49.375 --> 11:51.127
yes or no,
do we gotta deal?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.170
- Counter-offer.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.382
I blast the two of you
out of existence.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.800
- Drex!
- Come on Drex!

11:57.883 --> 11:59.218
- Come on, no.
- Don't!

12:00.636 --> 12:02.805
- Charlotte! Give it
30 thousand more volts...

12:02.888 --> 12:04.181
- Uhhh...

12:05.724 --> 12:06.559
- We have money!

12:06.642 --> 12:08.394
- We uh, we have two dollars!

12:08.477 --> 12:10.104
- We'll split it with ya!

12:10.187 --> 12:10.646
- No! Please!

12:10.729 --> 12:12.231
- Drex! No!

12:12.314 --> 12:13.732
- No!
- Nooooo!!!

12:16.193 --> 12:17.319
- Drex!

12:17.403 --> 12:18.904
Don't do it Drex!

12:18.988 --> 12:19.405
- Please don't!
I have a sister!

12:19.488 --> 12:20.322
- Oh God!!

12:20.406 --> 12:21.907
- Did he do it?

12:27.496 --> 12:28.956
- Ha ha!
- Ahhh ha ha!

12:31.667 --> 12:32.501
Ow!!

12:32.585 --> 12:34.336
Please don't
touch my arm!

12:34.420 --> 12:35.004
- What's wrong with your arm?

12:35.087 --> 12:36.338
- Did you find Drex?!?

12:36.422 --> 12:37.339
- Did you bring me a present?!?

12:37.423 --> 12:39.675
- Ohhhh Schwoz...

12:39.758 --> 12:43.471
My sweet little
foreign employee.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.348
I never thought I'd see you

12:46.432 --> 12:47.433
or your silly bald head,
ever again.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.269
- Oh yes, please hold me.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.521
- Okay...

12:52.605 --> 12:53.856
- Hey, why'd you guys think

12:53.939 --> 12:54.982
you'd never see us again?

12:55.065 --> 12:56.025
- Because, when we went
back in time,

12:56.108 --> 12:58.194
Drex stopped me
from being densitized

12:58.277 --> 12:59.153
when I was a kid.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.529
- Oh my god.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.322
- Oh, that's terrible.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.866
- Yeah, but...

13:03.949 --> 13:06.118
but how can you all,

13:06.202 --> 13:07.828
how can this all,
still be here?

13:07.912 --> 13:11.123
- Yeah, the future should
be different 'cuz Drex won.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.249
- So, what's goin' on?

13:12.333 --> 13:16.045
- Okay...

13:16.128 --> 13:17.838
Let me try to say this in a way

13:17.922 --> 13:21.175
that even a stupid
child could understand.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.469
- Thank you.
- How respectful of you.

13:26.430 --> 13:30.226
- See, a time portal
is like a door...

13:30.309 --> 13:32.144
to a hallway...

13:32.228 --> 13:34.230
to the past or the future.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.022
- Okay.
- All right.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.107
- You guys went to the past,

13:37.191 --> 13:38.234
and you changed things.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.486
But the doors remain open

13:40.569 --> 13:44.365
as long as the time machine
is active.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.242
- Okay.
So then let's turn it off.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.409
- Noooo!
- Stop him!

13:47.493 --> 13:49.703
- No, no, no,
no, no!

13:49.787 --> 13:51.580
- Dude!
Don't you get it?!?

13:51.664 --> 13:55.084
If we turn that off,
it's over, we're done!

13:55.167 --> 13:56.627
- Everything we know here

13:56.710 --> 13:59.213
would disappear
into nothingness!

13:59.296 --> 14:01.382
- Oh.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.261
- Schwoz...

14:05.344 --> 14:06.637
the time machine...

14:06.720 --> 14:08.931
can you send us back
to like, like a half hour

14:09.014 --> 14:11.350
before the time you just
pulled us back from?

14:11.433 --> 14:12.601
- I can try.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.187
- Well try, okay!
Try! Try!

14:15.271 --> 14:18.107
- Okay, pushy!

14:18.190 --> 14:19.400
You want to go right now?

14:19.483 --> 14:22.945
- No, not yet.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.957
- Oh my, they're chewing,
they're chewing!

14:43.841 --> 14:47.052
- Okay.
Let's blast to the past...

14:47.136 --> 14:49.638
- And wreck some Drex.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.473
- Wait!

14:51.557 --> 14:52.933
I'm gonna record
this moment.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.103
All right,
jump to the past on one.

14:56.186 --> 14:56.645
And...

14:56.729 --> 15:01.025
30, 29, 28...

15:01.108 --> 15:02.026
Aww.

15:05.654 --> 15:08.490
- Wh-what do we do?!?

15:11.827 --> 15:13.495
- Hey you!
Don't touch that!

15:13.579 --> 15:15.331
- Daddy, not now!

15:15.414 --> 15:16.206
- Daddy?!?

15:16.290 --> 15:19.501
- Ray!
Look at his hand-

15:33.390 --> 15:35.851
- Oh...wow.

15:35.934 --> 15:38.062
- This is...
- So freaky.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.940
- Good lord I'm handsome.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.109
- Whoa, I was just
about to say that!

15:44.193 --> 15:45.235
- For real?

15:45.319 --> 15:48.572
- Yeah man, I'm standin'
here lookin' at you

15:48.656 --> 15:49.865
and I'm thinkin'...

15:49.948 --> 15:52.242
- Daaaaaaaang.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.786
- Hey SHUT UP!

15:53.869 --> 15:56.080
- Oh dear.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.122
- Ray, look at his hand.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.374
- I see it.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.375
Schwoz dropped us here too late,

15:59.458 --> 16:00.918
Drex is already densitized.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.127
- But he hasn't destroyed
the densitizer yet.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.545
- What are you talkin' about?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.840
- I would also like to know
what you are talking about!

16:06.924 --> 16:09.760
- Ray! You and Henry
get Professor Manchester

16:09.843 --> 16:11.553
and all those people
out of this building!

16:11.637 --> 16:13.222
- But we gotta stay here
and fight Drex!

16:13.305 --> 16:14.306
- No, we'll handle that!

16:14.390 --> 16:16.392
- Trust us.
We know what we're doing.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.018
We're 20 minutes older.

16:18.102 --> 16:18.435
- Okay.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.438
- You...

16:21.522 --> 16:23.607
you're so handsome.

16:26.777 --> 16:27.861
- Okay everyone!
- Please exit out the back door!

16:27.945 --> 16:31.448
- What's wrong
with your arm Ray?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.367
- What's wrong with your face?

16:33.450 --> 16:34.618
- Dude, nice.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.328
- Thanks. Just came to me.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.205
- Yeah, keep laughin'.
'Cuz guess what?

16:38.288 --> 16:39.915
I stopped "little you"
from bein' densitized.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.583
Which means
I'm the only one

16:41.667 --> 16:43.460
in the room who's
indestructible.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.134
- Wh...
what happened?

16:50.217 --> 16:50.551
- It's little you!

16:50.634 --> 16:52.177
- Yeah!

16:55.681 --> 16:57.766
- Look out!
It's Doctor Night Night!

16:57.850 --> 16:59.852
- Doc--
- No, no, no.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.270
Captain Man,
see I never went to medical--

17:01.353 --> 17:03.063
AHHHHH!!

17:06.400 --> 17:07.317
- Captain Man!

17:07.401 --> 17:08.444
- AHHHHH!

17:08.527 --> 17:11.696
Just get little me
into that densitizer

17:11.780 --> 17:13.406
and pull the big lever!

17:13.490 --> 17:14.532
Don't worry about me!

17:14.616 --> 17:16.993
- I think Kid Danger
should worry about you.

17:17.077 --> 17:21.832
- Hang on,
where'd my fist go?

17:22.665 --> 17:24.501
- It's right there.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.795
- Oh right.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.597
- Okay, c'mon we gotta
get you in that machine

17:36.680 --> 17:39.308
and uhhh bombard you
with uhhh proton beams!

17:39.391 --> 17:40.726
- Daaaaaaddy, daaaddy!!

17:40.809 --> 17:42.019
- No, no, no,
Come back, come back.

17:42.102 --> 17:42.686
No, no, no seriously
we need to do this.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.687
This is very important.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.441
- Kid hurry!!!

17:47.524 --> 17:49.485
Get little me
into the densitizer!!!

17:49.568 --> 17:51.695
- Get back here.

17:54.114 --> 17:57.076
- I don't know if I can keep
this time machine working!

17:57.159 --> 17:58.327
Ahhhhh!

17:58.410 --> 18:01.079
We have to bring Ray
and Henry back, right now!

18:01.163 --> 18:03.332
- But what if they
haven't fixed the past?!?

18:03.415 --> 18:05.334
- Ayeeeee!

18:05.417 --> 18:06.710
If we don't bring them back now,

18:06.794 --> 18:08.921
we might not ever be able to!

18:11.840 --> 18:13.509
- Daddy!
- I need you to do this!

18:13.592 --> 18:16.637
I am trying to make
you a superhero!!!

18:19.097 --> 18:20.224
- Ahhh!

18:24.895 --> 18:26.105
- C'mon!

18:31.527 --> 18:33.153
- Yahhh!

18:41.703 --> 18:43.330
- Are you okay?

18:43.413 --> 18:45.707
- Yeah!
I feel great!

18:45.791 --> 18:47.584
[ crashing and yelling ]

18:51.046 --> 18:52.548
- Owwww!

18:52.631 --> 18:54.716
Hey!

18:54.800 --> 18:55.217
That only hurt
for a second!

19:03.767 --> 19:04.768
- Ahhh!
Oh, oh...

19:04.852 --> 19:08.313
Oh, uh, wha...

19:21.702 --> 19:22.286
- Captain Man!
How do you feel?!?

19:22.369 --> 19:24.079
- In two letters...

19:24.163 --> 19:25.414
Ohhh!

19:25.497 --> 19:27.082
Kay!

19:29.626 --> 19:31.962
- Sorry Drex...

19:32.045 --> 19:35.173
Looks like Captain Man's
indestructible again.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.009
- Everywhere.

19:40.178 --> 19:41.179
- So am I.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.602
Yahhhh!

19:46.685 --> 19:48.395
- Yahhh!
- Yahhh!

19:52.900 --> 19:53.775
- Here they come!!!

19:53.859 --> 19:57.070
- Yahhh!
- Yahhhh!

20:07.664 --> 20:08.957
- Schwoz, you got 'em back!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.459
- Yaya!
And look it!

20:10.542 --> 20:11.209
- Ahhh!

20:13.879 --> 20:14.796
- What's goin' on?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.632
- I have him trapped
in a time warp!

20:16.715 --> 20:17.424
- A time warp?!?

20:17.507 --> 20:18.634
- Wh-what does that mean?

20:18.717 --> 20:21.637
- Ugh....

20:21.720 --> 20:22.638
It means he's
stuck in limbo

20:22.721 --> 20:24.222
it's like he's
floating in time,

20:24.306 --> 20:26.892
somewhere between
the past,

20:26.975 --> 20:29.144
the present,
and the future!

20:30.687 --> 20:31.980
- Right, Schwoz,
move...

20:32.064 --> 20:34.900
Okay.
Okay, okay umm...

20:34.983 --> 20:36.568
Time destination...

20:36.652 --> 20:37.569
today's date...

20:37.653 --> 20:40.781
minus...

20:40.864 --> 20:43.367
100 million years.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.093
- AAAHHHhhhhhhhh!

21:03.387 --> 21:06.431
- Yeah!!
- Ha ha!

21:06.515 --> 21:07.432
- We did it!

21:10.727 --> 21:11.853
- What?

21:11.937 --> 21:14.564
[ beeping and whirring ]

21:14.648 --> 21:15.065
- What's going on?!?

21:15.148 --> 21:16.608
- Oh dear!

21:16.692 --> 21:17.985
- What, what what?!?

21:18.068 --> 21:19.111
- What's going on
with the time machine?!?

21:19.194 --> 21:21.571
- It's...
it's overloading!

21:21.655 --> 21:22.239
Ayeeeee!

21:22.322 --> 21:23.031
It's going to explode!!!

21:23.115 --> 21:25.283
It's gonna kill us all!!!

21:25.367 --> 21:26.451
It wil kill us all!!!

21:26.535 --> 21:29.121
- Not-not me!!!
Just you guys!!!

21:29.204 --> 21:31.748
- What? No!

21:31.832 --> 21:34.543
Get behind me!

21:34.626 --> 21:35.961
Get behind me!!

21:39.047 --> 21:40.882
- Huh?
- Wha?
