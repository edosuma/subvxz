00:10.617 --> 00:14.619
would you guys, you know, ingest it
or roll around in it to gain powers

00:14.621 --> 00:15.953
like the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles did?

00:15.955 --> 00:18.856
Did the Turtles eat it, or did
they just happen to wallow in it?

00:18.858 --> 00:20.558
- They wallowed.
- Yeah.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.960

Who did it not turn out okay for?

00:34.340 --> 00:36.307
Nobody. I mean, the ooze could be better

00:36.309 --> 00:38.142
than what's going, what,
you know, our existence

00:38.144 --> 00:39.911
right now, for some of us, right?

first thing that came to my mind

02:22.315 --> 02:23.814
was Evel Knievel toys, and...

emulating you and getting hurt?

02:48.508 --> 02:50.107
You know why he could?

02:50.109 --> 02:51.842
He was always telling
his fans to wear helmets.

02:51.844 --> 02:53.177
- [chuckles]
- You still can get

02:53.179 --> 02:55.279
horrifically injured
even wearing a helmet.

02:55.281 --> 02:56.947
Yeah, as he proved, like,

No. But still...

07:18.825 --> 07:20.458
Obviously it had a
great influence on you.

07:20.460 --> 07:22.360

07:22.362 --> 07:23.995
seeing them work together.

07:23.997 --> 07:25.997
Stan would act out
the plot in the office,

07:25.999 --> 07:27.898
jumpin' off the sides of the chairs,

07:27.900 --> 07:29.567
and my father'd be sitting
there writing notes,

07:29.569 --> 07:31.302
and I would come into the
office in the summertime,

07:31.304 --> 07:33.304

watch the two of them.

07:33.306 --> 07:34.905

08:03.670 --> 08:05.770

08:05.772 --> 08:07.538
- No.
- Or were you introduced to

08:07.540 --> 08:09.774
- comics through his work?
- Just through his work.

08:09.776 --> 08:11.342
He was doing romance books for D.C.

08:11.344 --> 08:14.278
And I would sit below his
table, and I would watch,

08:14.280 --> 08:16.113

08:19.285 --> 08:21.919
And one day, he was working
on "Daredevil" ♪12,

08:21.921 --> 08:23.387
I remember it vividly.

08:23.389 --> 08:24.722
Daredevil surrounded
by all the bad guys,

08:24.724 --> 08:26.123
so how's he going to get out of it?

08:26.125 --> 08:27.425
And he explained, "He's a superhero,

08:27.427 --> 08:29.560
and he also happens to be blind."

08:29.562 --> 08:31.629
And I think the top of my head exploded.

08:31.631 --> 08:34.765
And that moment was just
a turning point to me,

08:34.767 --> 08:37.134
because I... he told
me I stayed by his side

08:37.135 --> 08:39.203
for days at a time
after that, just drawing.

08:39.205 --> 08:40.404
I was seven or eight years old.

08:40.405 --> 08:42.306
Because of that issue of "Daredevil?"

08:42.308 --> 08:44.107
That moment. I had to find
out what this was all about,

08:44.110 --> 08:45.643
'cause of my father.

08:45.645 --> 08:49.080
- It has to be genetic, right?
- I don't know.

08:49.082 --> 08:52.283
Before my father, my
grandfather was a woodworker.

08:52.285 --> 08:53.984
Worked on coffins.

08:53.986 --> 08:56.821
My brother is brilliant, but
never artistic the way I was,

08:56.823 --> 08:59.990
and for some reason, it filtered
down to me, I don't know.

08:59.992 --> 09:01.992
Listen, my artwork is okay.

09:01.994 --> 09:03.928
I followed him, I've
been influenced by him,

09:03.930 --> 09:05.730
but I'm not anywhere in his class.

09:05.732 --> 09:08.232
He's Michael Jordan, I'm
the sixth guy on the bench.

09:08.234 --> 09:10.401
He's still Michael Jordan,
but you're Scottie Pippen.

09:10.403 --> 09:11.936
Oh, thank you! [laughter]

09:11.938 --> 09:14.105

You still got the rings.

09:14.107 --> 09:15.639
- Still got the rings, my friend.
- All right!

09:15.641 --> 09:17.308
That's a nice analogy.
I appreciate that.

09:17.310 --> 09:19.477
In his mind, he'll always be the guy

09:19.479 --> 09:20.578
that became an artist.

09:20.580 --> 09:22.613
His dad was the artist,

09:22.615 --> 09:24.281
from the moment he knew him, so,

09:24.283 --> 09:26.751
I got to imagine the
guy defers to his dad.

09:26.753 --> 09:28.452
I would look at that guy like a hero.

09:28.454 --> 09:30.087
My dad worked at the post office,

09:30.089 --> 09:31.422

09:38.798 --> 09:40.698
The Jim Lees, you know, the Kuberts...

09:40.700 --> 09:43.634
We watched the industry
grow while we were in it,

09:43.636 --> 09:45.369
Speaking of Jim Lee, this is...

09:45.371 --> 09:47.271
I'm looking at something
beautiful on the wall.

door, and uh, we thought...

09:50.176 --> 09:51.942

09:51.944 --> 09:53.644

- That's why it's red.

09:53.646 --> 09:54.879

- He came in,

09:54.881 --> 09:56.580

09:56.582 --> 09:58.015

10:19.572 --> 10:21.071

got a big sheet of paper.

10:21.073 --> 10:22.740

- All right, thanks, man.

10:25.311 --> 10:27.645
- Spider-Man is one of the greats.
- Superman, one of the greats,

10:27.647 --> 10:30.725
but drawing Daredevil is a pleasure,
so I would love to do those three.

10:30.725 --> 10:31.731
Man, absolutely.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.696
'Cause I mean, a lot of times, you know,

10:34.783 --> 10:36.869
your dad tries to get
you into what he likes,

10:37.001 --> 10:38.898
and it doesn't take, it
doesn't rub off on you.

10:39.068 --> 10:40.416
No, he didn't actually want me to be...

10:40.573 --> 10:42.272
He wanted me to be an
artist, but not a cartoonist,

10:42.272 --> 10:43.829
because this is a guy that
went up to his attic...

10:43.830 --> 10:45.444
You know, the attic door...
And he would disappear

10:45.511 --> 10:48.012
up there for days, come
back with a three-day growth,

10:48.014 --> 10:49.813
and he would be exhausted
from not sleeping,

10:49.815 --> 10:51.548
and he said the money was lousy.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.984
He says, "Be an artist. Do
anything else, advertising."

10:53.986 --> 10:56.086
Went into advertising,
illustration as a major,

10:56.088 --> 10:58.989
and I couldn't stop myself
from wanting to be a cartoonist.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.758
And I remembered Stan
Lee telling a story

11:00.760 --> 11:02.860
that when he was a young writer,
he'd go to cocktail parties.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.328
And they'd ask what he
did for... "I'm a writer."

11:04.330 --> 11:05.996
"What do you write?"
"I write comic books."

11:05.998 --> 11:07.731
And they would giggle, you know.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.566
And now Stan is who he is,

11:09.568 --> 11:11.402
but the conversation when I
was younger was the same thing:

11:11.404 --> 11:12.836
"You're an artist, what do you do?"

11:12.838 --> 11:14.672
"I'm a cartoonist." "Oh, really?"

11:14.674 --> 11:16.640
You know, giggle giggle.
And now, "I'm a cartoonist,

11:16.642 --> 11:18.943
"I work on graphic novels, Spider-Man,

11:18.945 --> 11:20.411
Batman, Superman."

11:20.413 --> 11:22.746
And suddenly: "Wow! You're an artist!"

11:22.748 --> 11:25.449
"Oh, first I was a
cartoonist, now I'm an artist."

11:25.451 --> 11:27.718
But you know, they changed
because of you, though.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.186
You played a big part in that.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.554
Well, I don't know
about me particularly,

11:30.556 --> 11:32.356
but Jack Kirby, John Buscema,

11:32.358 --> 11:35.092
John Romita, Stan Lee, that's
what changed everything.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.456
If you guys had to be
stranded on Gilligan's Island

11:48.458 --> 11:51.025

- This is young Mike? As in... Okay.
- Young Mike, yes.

11:55.665 --> 11:57.332
Young Mike goes out, gets stranded...

11:57.334 --> 11:59.200
- On a three-hour cruise.
- Three-hour cruise.

11:59.202 --> 12:02.570
- With just a movie starlet.
- No, no, that was Ginger.

12:02.572 --> 12:04.172

a day on that island.

12:23.226 --> 12:26.060

- That is easy: Skipper.

12:26.062 --> 12:28.563

Skipper kind of a jerk?

his work very fondly,

"Man Without Fear" every month.

16:15.076 --> 16:17.276
I called in about the
Treasury Edition Wonder Woman?

16:17.278 --> 16:19.078
Oh, that's right. I
put it aside for you.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.579
- Awesome.
- Here it is.

16:20.581 --> 16:21.880
- Aah.
- The Treasury Edition

16:21.882 --> 16:23.348
of "Wonder Woman" number 1.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.351
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

16:29.757 --> 16:31.590
- This looks amazing!
- Huh?

16:31.592 --> 16:33.425
Wonder Woman kicking Nazi ass.

16:33.427 --> 16:34.793
[all laugh]

16:34.795 --> 16:36.128
- Right?
- Yeah.

16:36.130 --> 16:37.329
So, I have a question for you.

16:37.331 --> 16:38.831
This has always been on my mind.

16:38.833 --> 16:41.300
Why these "Treasury Edition" comics?

16:41.302 --> 16:43.702
Well, my first reasoning would be

16:43.704 --> 16:45.637
if you couldn't afford
"Wonder Woman" number 1,

16:45.639 --> 16:47.840
this book would be
something you'd treasure.

16:47.842 --> 16:49.708
- Nice.
- You know, back in 1975,

16:49.710 --> 16:51.910
D.C. was taking significant issues

16:51.912 --> 16:53.946
and doing facsimile editions

16:53.948 --> 16:56.281
of what the issue looked
like back in the '40s,

16:56.283 --> 16:57.649
giving a chance for readers, you know,

16:57.651 --> 17:00.686
to pick it up for the
small price of a buck.

17:00.688 --> 17:02.554
Remember the Treasury
Edition comic books?

17:02.556 --> 17:03.956
Of course. As a collector,

17:03.958 --> 17:05.691
it was always a pain in the neck.

17:05.693 --> 17:07.859
They don't make bags and
boards for books that big,

17:07.862 --> 17:10.028
but as a reader, I loved
the oversized treasury book.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.363
- Oh, yeah.
- They should do it

17:11.365 --> 17:13.132
for everything in life.

17:13.134 --> 17:15.000
They're like, "You like
this? it's bigger now!"

17:15.002 --> 17:17.069
[all laugh]

17:17.070 --> 17:18.403
So, you a big Wonder Woman fan?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.372
- Absolutely.
- What gave that away?

17:20.374 --> 17:22.473
Perhaps her Wonder
Woman fingernail polish?

17:22.476 --> 17:25.042
- Ooh!
- Or her Wonder Woman kicks.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.878
I mean, she's a legendary character.

17:26.881 --> 17:28.680
And she's one of those
people that... not...

17:28.682 --> 17:30.082
I want to be her, right?

17:30.084 --> 17:32.050
Are you excited to finally, finally

17:32.052 --> 17:33.418
see her represented in a movie?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.254
Oh, absolutely! Yeah.

17:35.256 --> 17:37.089
Go into any comic book
store in the world,

17:37.091 --> 17:39.091
Wonder Woman is represented somewhere,

17:39.093 --> 17:41.527
and now she's about to break mainstream,

17:41.529 --> 17:44.029
because of the Batman v Superman movie.

17:44.031 --> 17:45.697
That's the first cinematic treatment

17:45.699 --> 17:47.232
of the character, am I correct?

17:47.234 --> 17:48.667
They've never made a Wonder Woman movie.

17:48.669 --> 17:49.768
They've made a TV movie,

17:49.770 --> 17:51.370
and other than the cartoons,

17:51.372 --> 17:52.905
they haven't cracked the code

17:52.907 --> 17:54.506
with Wonder Woman since the '70s.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.241
Absolutely. Not since the days

17:56.243 --> 17:57.743
of Lynda Carter Wonder Woman

17:57.745 --> 17:59.611
has she been on the tips
of everybody's tongues

17:59.613 --> 18:01.180
as she is right now, right?

18:01.182 --> 18:03.448
Sounded filthier than
you meant it, but yes.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.284
[all laugh]

18:05.286 --> 18:09.087
So, um, what... what are we asking for?

18:09.089 --> 18:11.290
- $45.
- $45.

18:11.292 --> 18:13.759
If I had a lasso of truth
and I were to lasso you,

18:13.761 --> 18:16.728
what would you say to $25?

18:16.730 --> 18:18.931
I'd say... no.

18:18.933 --> 18:20.799
Lasso of truth says no.

18:20.801 --> 18:23.569
I'm not lying to you... I
would definitely say no to $25.

18:23.571 --> 18:25.971
Um... it's not in mint
condition, but if it was a mint,

18:25.973 --> 18:27.639
it'd go for a lot more than $45.

18:27.641 --> 18:29.274
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, it's got a little...

18:29.276 --> 18:30.876
A little wear on the side there,

18:30.878 --> 18:33.312
but you know, overall,
it's a really nice copy.

18:33.314 --> 18:35.747
How about $35?

18:35.749 --> 18:38.217
How about I agree to $35,

18:38.219 --> 18:40.452
and I get hugs from each one of you?

18:40.454 --> 18:42.221
- I'll do it, yeah, you know.
- A hug.

18:42.223 --> 18:43.755
Awesome! Then you've
got a deal, my friend.

18:43.757 --> 18:45.457
All right. All right.

18:45.459 --> 18:47.559
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.727
- Not at all.
- Thank you for this.

18:48.729 --> 18:50.329
[laughs] Thank you so much.

18:50.331 --> 18:52.030
- Appreciate it. Bye.
- Bye.

19:57.131 --> 20:01.066
with these characters,
wearing the logo of logos.

20:13.914 --> 20:15.380
Gotta feel lucky as hell

20:15.382 --> 20:17.683
to live in a world where, like,

20:17.685 --> 20:21.620
not only can you appreciate
someone's artwork from afar,

20:21.622 --> 20:23.889
but now they'll come down
to the comic book store

20:23.891 --> 20:25.857
and draw for you, or with you,

20:25.859 --> 20:27.693
and show you how it's done, and stuff.

20:27.695 --> 20:30.529
Then to learn that they're
actually a human being,

20:30.531 --> 20:32.297
interesting, funny, a good guy.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.900
Just because somebody's
exceptional at their job

20:34.902 --> 20:36.835
beyond comprehension,

20:36.837 --> 20:39.104
doesn't mean they can't
just be a normal person, man.
