38:32.018 --> 38:33.508
Evening, Rachel.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.136
Kind of busy here, Bass.

38:37.774 --> 38:38.889
Right.

38:39.067 --> 38:42.856
The machine, the amplifier.

38:43.863 --> 38:47.527
As you explained to Major Neville
and Captain Burke.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.118
Yes.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.704
And this machine, it, uh...

38:55.542 --> 38:58.876
It amplifies the range of the pendant.

38:59.546 --> 39:01.787
What is this about, Bass?

39:02.465 --> 39:06.083
You know, Major Neville
is an invaluable member of my team.

39:07.679 --> 39:13.800
His instincts,
his little hunches about people.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.058
They are almost never wrong.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.647
He had a little hunch
about what you're doing here, Rachel.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.150
So we brought in a second opinion.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.156
One of your old colleagues.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.317
You remember Dr. Jaffe?

39:33.663 --> 39:36.746
- He's graciously agreed to work with us.
RACHEL: Brad.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.082
Brad.

39:43.256 --> 39:48.092
Dr. Jaffe, could you please
take a look at this machine?

39:48.261 --> 39:49.501
Tell us what it can do.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.016
It's an amplifier.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.272
Brad.

40:19.626 --> 40:22.288
- It's a bomb.
- You're lying.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.578
I'm sorry, Rachel,
but I know what I'm looking at.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.167
Pretty sophisticated time bomb.

40:30.470 --> 40:34.555
The pendant acts like an electric trigger.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.884
I'd imagine she'd set it to go off
when you were here but she wasn't.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.433
- No.
- No?

40:42.607 --> 40:45.224
Listen to me. Listen to me.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.065
What did you think was gonna happen,
Rachel?

40:49.238 --> 40:51.070
- Listen to me.
- You were gonna kill me?

40:51.240 --> 40:54.483
Escape with Danny in the chaos?
We had a deal.

40:54.661 --> 40:58.404
And I kept my end of the bargain,
but now it's over.

41:00.208 --> 41:04.076
I will build you another amplifier.
There is a lot about the necklace--

41:04.253 --> 41:06.335
- You are dead!
- No!

41:06.506 --> 41:09.464
And Danny is dead.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.969
You need me.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.636
I need you? No, Rachel. I don't need you.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.849
I have Dr. Jaffe. I have his pendant.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.356
And he's been a hell of a lot more
cooperative than you've ever been.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.483
- Bass.
- No, Rachel.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.771
This is over.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.573
I don't need you anymore.

41:37.286 --> 41:39.072
Get her out of here.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.282
