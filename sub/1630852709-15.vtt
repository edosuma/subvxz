00:09.551 --> 00:11.636


00:11.720 --> 00:14.055


00:14.139 --> 00:15.015


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.157 --> 00:34.200


00:34.284 --> 00:37.454


00:38.079 --> 00:40.957


00:41.041 --> 00:43.418


00:43.501 --> 00:46.004


00:52.594 --> 00:54.804
Whoo-hoo!

00:54.888 --> 00:55.722
Next!

00:55.805 --> 01:00.560
Oh man, I can't wait to check out
the new mod Harold and Penley built.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.853


01:01.936 --> 01:04.105
Speaking of can't wait-- ugh!

01:04.189 --> 01:06.149
Why did I eat all that tapioca?

01:06.232 --> 01:08.651
But must get on the slide.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.737
I can do this. I can and I--

01:10.820 --> 01:11.905
-
-Ooh!

01:11.988 --> 01:13.531
-

01:13.615 --> 01:15.075
Oh! False alarm.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.701
Chuck, what are you doing?

01:16.785 --> 01:20.455
Just a little something called
aerodynamic friction reduction.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.625
Plus, this weather dries
my feathers out.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.668
Don't you think you're too slick?

01:25.752 --> 01:28.254
There's no such thing
as too slick, Stella.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.589
Hey! Where y'all going?

01:37.430 --> 01:38.556
Next!

01:39.682 --> 01:40.934
Here we go.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.019
Hey, not cool.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.104
Not so fast.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.022
New rule,

01:46.105 --> 01:49.901
there is now a minimum height requirement
to go on the big slide.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.236
Stand over there.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.656
Aww, too short.<i> Next!</i>

01:54.739 --> 01:56.199
Wait, what?
You're kidding, right?

01:56.282 --> 01:58.451
<i>I never kid, kid.</i>

01:58.535 --> 02:01.079
No way I'm too short.
I demand a recount.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.877
Ugh!

02:10.296 --> 02:11.339
Next!

02:12.757 --> 02:15.593
You can't do this.
<i>This is a total injustice.</i>

02:15.677 --> 02:18.513
<i>It goes against everything</i>
<i>Camp Splinterwood stands for.</i>

02:18.596 --> 02:22.100
<i>When I look around, you know what I see?</i>
<i>I see equality.</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:27.605
<i>I don't see tall or short,</i>
<i>boy or girl, pig or bird.</i>

02:27.689 --> 02:28.690
<i>I see--</i>

02:30.525 --> 02:33.236
My so-called friends totally turning
their back on me!

02:33.319 --> 02:37.323
Sorry, buddy. Epic speech and all,
but that slide!

02:37.407 --> 02:39.284
Yeah! If I don't go, I'm gonna blow.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.161
-And not in a good way.

02:41.244 --> 02:45.039
Okay, A. Gross. Two, can't let all this
slickness go to waste.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.333
And, F. Seriously, ew.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.586
There's probably a reason for the rule.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.131
Not everything is some big injustice
that needs to be fought.

02:54.465 --> 02:58.386
It'll take like 10 minutes, then we can
go to something else. Okay?

02:59.804 --> 03:02.181
-Ugh.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.856
Hello, Red. How come you're
not on the big slide with everyone else?

03:09.939 --> 03:12.483
Ohh. Apparently, there's some
new height requirement.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.153
That's why the hatchlings couldn't get on.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.323
That is so cute! You guys are twinsies.

03:20.199 --> 03:23.036
You're welcome to join them.
I'm sure you'll fit right in.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.752
-Huh?
-Oh! Ow!

03:36.633 --> 03:39.052
[hatchlings groaning and moaning

03:43.306 --> 03:45.516
Unh!

03:55.276 --> 03:57.987
That was amazing!

03:58.071 --> 04:01.574
Yeah, I'm gonna go get on,
like, a thousand more times today.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.036
OMG. That was so much fun I laid an egg.
Like literally.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.205
-Ahem!
-I'll call him Chuck Junior.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.458
-But you can call him Chazz. It's cooler.
-Ahem!

04:10.541 --> 04:12.502
Me and Chuck Junior
are gonna ride the slide

04:12.585 --> 04:14.420
every single day!

04:14.504 --> 04:15.421
Ahem!

04:15.505 --> 04:17.257
You okay, Stella? If you're getting sick,

04:17.340 --> 04:19.342
I'd ask you to please
step away from Chuck Jr.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.678
So I'm guessing the slide wasâ€¦

04:21.761 --> 04:23.680
Yeah, it was so-so.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.101
Who am I kidding?
It was chick'n awesome!

04:28.184 --> 04:29.811
We're sorry, Red.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.939
Hey, cheer up, buddy. I'm sure
you'll be tall enough in a year.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.649
-Or two.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.317
-But you little guys,

04:36.401 --> 04:38.361
gonna be a long time.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.407
So what do you want
to do next?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.289
You know what? You guys go on without me.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.374
I've got something I need
to do with the hatchlings.

04:51.457 --> 04:55.211
Really? Okay. Well, then I guess
we'll see you later?

04:57.297 --> 05:00.508
Listen up. I'm getting us all
on the big slide.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.054
Look, we may be small,
but we can use that.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.140
Turn our weakness into our strength.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.767
-And here's how we're gonna do it.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.103
Phase one, carbo-load.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.441
We're going to need
all the energy we can get.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.694
Also, I have a hankering
for some worm muffins.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.201
Meh.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.245
Ah, well.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.669
Phase 2, we use stealth
to get to the front of the line.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.681
Next, our biggest challenge, phase 3.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.518
The Big Cheese herself, Lynette.

05:55.354 --> 05:58.024
-Ahh! Unh!
-Whee!

05:59.275 --> 06:01.402
Come back here!

06:01.486 --> 06:03.112
-Ahh! What?
-Ha-ha!

06:04.530 --> 06:06.282
And we are go!

06:06.365 --> 06:09.619
Red! Red! Red! Red!

06:09.702 --> 06:12.330
Yeah, I guess I am a hero.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.750
Now let's get our slide on!

06:24.133 --> 06:25.468
Here it comes.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.098
This is gonna be awesome!

06:41.400 --> 06:43.903
You'll be hearing
from my attorney, Mister.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.406
Hey, Matilda, you haven't seen Red
have you?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.742
He said he was going to do something
with the hatchlings.

06:49.826 --> 06:53.204
Actually, I haven't seen
any of them for a while.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.499
If you see them, please tell me,

06:56.582 --> 06:59.544
because if anything were
to happen to my beautiful babies,

06:59.627 --> 07:00.878
I wouldn't know what to do!!

07:02.171 --> 07:04.882
Ah, look at that. An really interesting
thing you should definitely look at

07:04.966 --> 07:06.926
for at least long enough for us
to get out of here.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.430
Oh, jeez, they're not gonna make it.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.723
Should we give them a hand?

07:12.807 --> 07:13.933
Absolutely not.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.645
This is why I implemented
the height requirement in the first place.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.440
They broke the rules,
they're own their own.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.316
Let's do this.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.111
We gotta get to them quick.
They're gonna fall.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.865
This is the moment
I've been waiting for my whole life.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.993
Daddy's gotta go be a hero.
Grease me up.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.911
-Ugh!

07:37.582 --> 07:40.084
Hang on, Red! We're coming!

07:40.751 --> 07:44.088
Don't worry, cheeps.
My friends are gonna save us.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.842
Mwah! Ha ha!

07:47.925 --> 07:49.552
Let's lock and load.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.889
It's go time.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.019
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

07:58.102 --> 08:00.646
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:00.730 --> 08:04.066
Have no fear, Chuck is here!

08:15.661 --> 08:17.663
-It's gonna be okay.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.629
Ahh!

08:24.712 --> 08:27.173
-I may have spoken too soon.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.762
No, wait, it is gonna be okay.

08:32.845 --> 08:37.058
You're small. You can do things
other birds can't, like fit on that ledge.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.018
On my count. Ready?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.313
And, one, two, three, swing.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.485
Now, you guys get out of here.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.405
A goodbye would've been nice.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.788
Well, I guess this is it.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.666
Oh!

09:01.749 --> 09:04.377
Never doubted you guys for a second.

09:39.453 --> 09:42.540
Well, I hope you all
learned your lesson here.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.500
That's why there are rules.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.421
Sorry, little cheeps.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.132
I thought I was a hero,
but I was an idiot.

09:51.215 --> 09:56.137
Are you freaking kidding? We got to
save the day. It was awesome!

09:56.637 --> 09:58.681
I decided not to press charges.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.268
-You're okay!
-I was.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.356
Thanks for trying to save me, Chuck.
Sorry about, you know.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.985
I'm totally fine. I was so slippery
I slid to the infirmary.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.362
-There you are.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.365
Did something happen to the slide?

10:16.449 --> 10:20.870
I was so busy looking at that thing you
pointed out, Chuck, I didn't notice.

10:20.953 --> 10:25.207
Well, now that that's settled, I think
Chuck Junior needs a little Daddy time.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.419
All right, Junior, let me tell you
the tale of Mighty Chuck Senior

10:28.502 --> 10:31.088
and how he saved the day
when the big slide broke.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.715
Uh, little help?

10:39.722 --> 10:40.848
Chazz?
