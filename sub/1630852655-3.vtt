00:01.000 --> 00:03.400
(dramatic music)

00:03.480 --> 00:04.600
(bomb exploding)

00:04.680 --> 00:07.040
- We are now four days post attack,

00:07.120 --> 00:09.040
and as of 9:00 AM this morning,

00:09.120 --> 00:11.200
the death toll now stands at 18.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.760
- Working hypothesis?

00:12.840 --> 00:14.880
- A targeted attack by an Islamist group.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.960
- [Sonya] I found this.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.520
- Improvised detonator,
ISIS's go-to det of choice.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.880
- My gut tells me we're dealing
with sophisticated bombers,

00:23.960 --> 00:26.760
not some amateur Islamist
who's got a grudge.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.160
- Just stick to what you know, okay?

00:30.160 --> 00:33.120
- When it comes to
explosives, I'm the expert.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.200
I know what I saw.

00:36.920 --> 00:37.760
- [Sonya] You were right, Wash.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.560
They abandoned their
factory and planted evidence

00:39.640 --> 00:40.640
to make it look Islamist.

00:40.720 --> 00:41.960
That stain proves it.

00:42.040 --> 00:42.800
- How the hell are the bombers

00:42.880 --> 00:44.880
getting military-grade explosive?

00:45.440 --> 00:46.920
You working?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.760
- Is he bollocks?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.840
- It's just tough at the minute.

00:51.480 --> 00:56.280
- It was always "my team needs
me" with Nut, like we didn't.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.000
- [PS Brown] IED left centre.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.360
- [Lana] Battery pack explosive
taped underneath the desk.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.800
- [Danny] All set?

01:10.600 --> 01:12.400
- The device was found by
a worshipper in the mosque.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.880
Everyone's been evacuated.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.360
- Islamists don't bomb mosques.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.560
- There's like a, like a bag.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.360
- [Lana] Was there anything attached,

01:17.440 --> 01:18.720
like a mobile phone or a watch?

01:18.800 --> 01:20.120
- [Mohammed] Yeah, yeah, a watch.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.600
- There's an explosive
device triggered by movement.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.240
Just stay really, really still, okay?

01:24.320 --> 01:26.320
- Get out now!

01:26.400 --> 01:27.600
(Lana panting)

01:27.680 --> 01:31.640
- [Ali] Can you get me out of here please?

01:31.720 --> 01:34.960
(police siren blaring)

01:35.040 --> 01:37.200
I don't wanna die.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.280
Help, please help, help.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.760
Can you help me please?

01:41.840 --> 01:43.200
Get me out of here, please?

01:43.280 --> 01:44.720
I'm really scared.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.840
- I need those people taken
back to the second cordon,

01:47.920 --> 01:49.600
an extra 50 yards at least.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.160
Any police officer on this
side of the cordon needs

01:52.240 --> 01:54.240
to be wearing a lid.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.640
(Ali sobbing)

01:57.720 --> 01:59.720
- Okay, listen to me.
- Please help me.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.160
- I know it's scary.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.320
I'm a bit scared, but it's gonna be fine.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.600
I'm just gonna get some tools out,

02:04.680 --> 02:06.600
so just stay really still
and really quiet, yeah?

02:06.680 --> 02:08.520
- [Ali] Please get me out of here.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.360
I don't know what's going on.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.640
Can you get me out please?
- Still and quiet.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.880
(police siren wailing)

02:13.960 --> 02:15.880
- You've got 90 seconds, Lana!

02:15.960 --> 02:17.600
Hurry!
- Please help me.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.920
- [Thom] If you can hear
me, you need to hurry!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.960
- [Ali] Get me out of here!

02:23.040 --> 02:24.880
No, no, no, no, don't leave.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.160
Don't leave, please.
- Keep calm.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.040
- Please.
- Please,

02:27.120 --> 02:29.120
will you just shut up?

02:29.200 --> 02:31.280
Please try and stay calm.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
- Please help me.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.440
Help me, please.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.880
Please.
- My hands are slipping.

02:37.960 --> 02:42.960
(Ali sobbing)
(door banging)

02:46.600 --> 02:48.520
- Lana!

02:48.600 --> 02:50.560
Lana!

02:50.640 --> 02:51.880
Lana!

02:51.960 --> 02:55.600
- Please, help me.
- Please be quiet.

02:55.680 --> 02:59.400
- [Ali] Help, please,
please don't leave me.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.120
(watch ticking)

03:03.160 --> 03:04.000
- [Inspector Robins] 30 seconds.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.680
(door banging)

03:08.840 --> 03:10.760
- We've got 30 seconds.
- I'm nearly there.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.440
- Please, Lana, please.
- I'm nearly...

03:13.520 --> 03:14.520
Danny, get off.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.360
I'm nearly there.
- God help me.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.680
Please, God, help me.
- I'm nearly there.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.640
- Don't leave.
- Let's go.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.040
- I'm nearly there.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.080
No, get, get off.
- Let's go, let's go.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.160
- [Ali] No, don't leave me here.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.240
Don't leave me up here.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.480
I don't wanna die!

03:27.560 --> 03:28.560
Please don't go.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.320
God help me.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.960
- Hard cover!
- Hard cover!

03:32.040 --> 03:33.760
- Hard cover!
- Hard cover!

03:33.840 --> 03:35.080
- Hard cover!
- Get down!

03:35.160 --> 03:36.000
(bomb exploding)

03:36.080 --> 03:39.080
(crowd gasping)

03:39.160 --> 03:42.240
(car alarms blaring)

03:46.560 --> 03:47.320
- Shit.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.240
(crowd murmuring)

03:56.240 --> 03:59.000
(dramatic music)

04:01.920 --> 04:02.680
(police siren blaring)

04:02.760 --> 04:04.640
- [Radio] EXPO have concluded
search for secondaries.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.560
Site secure.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.960
- EXPO 2 Alpha, received.

04:07.040 --> 04:12.040
(car door banging)
(solemn music)

04:21.560 --> 04:23.560
I'm sorry, Lana.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.720
- Let's go.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.080
(car engine roaring)

04:40.160 --> 04:41.840
- We need that audio file traced.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.160
Ask Security Services if
they've got any updates

04:44.240 --> 04:46.120
on our priority targets.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.720
This is a P1 investigation.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.040
We've got access to all
the best assets in terms

04:50.120 --> 04:52.360
of surveillance and technical resources.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.040
Let's use them, please.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.640
I'll need CCTV trawls from
every camera within five miles

04:57.720 --> 04:58.680
of that mosque.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.680
Now, now more than ever,

04:59.760 --> 05:02.320
we're under pressure to get a result.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.280
I want the suspect list cut down.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.680
We can eliminate any extremist in custody

05:06.760 --> 05:09.600
or already under surveillance
as persons of interest, yeah?

05:09.680 --> 05:10.880
- Right, everyone.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.400
Thank you all for working
through the night on the incident

05:13.480 --> 05:14.880
at Amburiq Mosque.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.920
This situation now takes priority

05:17.000 --> 05:19.320
for all counter-terror units.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.760
It's almost 2:00am.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.640
I have an ELG meeting in five minutes.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.040
Give me something to bring.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.960
- Ma'am, this recorded
message was sent to us

05:27.040 --> 05:30.880
and every single major news
station on an encrypted service.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.000
- [Recorded Message] This
is payback for Westhaven.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.400
Amburiq was the start of the fight back.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.840
We call on the white race to take up arms.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.200
We are the Crusaders.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.000
- The audio source is heavily encrypted.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.520
Tech are giving us everything they have,

05:42.600 --> 05:43.360
but it might be a dead end.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.720
- [DS Hamilton] I'll get GCHQ to apply

05:44.800 --> 05:45.880
a little more pressure on the servers.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.680
Any evidence at the scene
confirming their involvement?

05:47.760 --> 05:49.080
- Hi.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.040
- This flag was used as
the gag on the victim.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.640
No prints or DNA on it.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.080
- [DS Hamilton] These Crusaders
aren't known to our friends

05:55.160 --> 05:56.040
at Thames House?

05:56.120 --> 05:58.200
- Agatha Jack tried to take English Flag

05:58.280 --> 05:59.680
into the mainstream.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.520
Seems like a few splinter groups formed,

06:01.600 --> 06:02.440
but no previous with the Crusaders, no.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.320
- Anything about the vic
that appears significant?

06:05.400 --> 06:06.800
- Ali Hussein was the Muezzin.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.600
It's an important role in the community.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.720
He leads the call to prayer,

06:09.800 --> 06:11.480
responsible for keeping the mosque clean.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.240
Most important, as Muezzin,

06:13.320 --> 06:14.800
it would have been responsibility

06:14.880 --> 06:16.880
to welcome any newcomer.

06:17.640 --> 06:21.960
At 13:56, a white man with
a black baseball cap walks

06:22.040 --> 06:24.040
into the mosque, carrying a blue bag.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.520
It was Jummah, Friday prayers,

06:26.600 --> 06:29.560
lots of comings and goings,
larger congregations.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.920
14:09, black baseball cap
leaves the mosque empty-handed.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.400
- [Thom] And head down. He's a pro.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.240
He knows where the cameras are.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.440
- We need to identify him.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.680
Lana, I appreciate you coming
in to make your report.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.800
Anything about yesterday we need to know?

06:44.840 --> 06:46.880
- The device appeared to be designed

06:46.960 --> 06:48.600
to stop us gaining access to the room

06:48.680 --> 06:50.520
where the victim was located.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
On closer examination,

06:52.680 --> 06:56.400
I discovered a secondary
time switch with a countdown

06:56.480 --> 06:58.480
and a tilt switch.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.920
Unfortunately, I ran out of time.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.040
Sonya, have you got the video file?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.120
- Yeah.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.280
- So if you look at the impact,

07:07.360 --> 07:10.120
it's obvious they used a high explosive.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.320
- Like used on the compound
at the bomb factory,

07:12.400 --> 07:14.520
and found on the main charge at Westhaven.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
But we need a chemical confirmation.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.880
- Okay, that's a priority
in tracking the bombers.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.560
Get on top of this.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.680
- Ma'am.
- Let's get moving.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.880
(dramatic music)
(group murmuring)

07:25.960 --> 07:28.560
(machine rumbling)

07:28.640 --> 07:31.280
(door creaking)

07:32.720 --> 07:33.560
- Alright, Wash?

07:33.640 --> 07:35.840
Stick the kettle on.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.160
- Could have used a second EXPO unit.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.000
Where were you?

07:39.080 --> 07:40.040
Just hanging out?

07:40.120 --> 07:42.080
- You're joking.
- Do I look like I'm joking?

07:42.160 --> 07:42.920
Where was my backup?
- Wash, come on, mate.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.200
- If you'd have done your job properly,

07:44.280 --> 07:45.080
then we wouldn't be in this
fucking mess, would we?

07:45.160 --> 07:45.920
- Ten Liner request-

07:46.000 --> 07:47.160
Ten Liner request never
mentioned a second EXPO team.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.920
- Didn't they?
- He's right.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.080
We never got any call for backup.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.520
- It's the Senior's role to
request additional support,

07:51.600 --> 07:53.440
and that's you, right?

07:53.520 --> 07:56.240
Why don't you get some sleep
and sort your fucking head out?

07:56.320 --> 07:57.760
- Oi, come on.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.360
- [Lana] Get off!

08:00.440 --> 08:02.440
- [Danny] Lana!

08:05.920 --> 08:08.600
(doors banging)

08:39.160 --> 08:41.840
(phone buzzing)

08:46.600 --> 08:48.520
- Billy, what?

08:48.600 --> 08:52.000
(car horn beeping)

08:52.080 --> 08:55.080
(people chattering)

08:58.240 --> 09:00.440
Look at the bloody state of ya.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.360
Halal butchers?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.440
Idiot.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.520
(coffee trickling)

09:14.600 --> 09:17.280
(spoon banging)

09:19.080 --> 09:21.960
You know you are allowed
to clean up, Billy.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.360
Where's Becky?

09:23.440 --> 09:25.440
- She's at her mum's.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.200
Here you are.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.200
- You need to get that hand checked out.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.480
There could be glass
and all sorts in there.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.800
So you like it here?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.880
- Yeah, it's a palace, innit?

09:44.200 --> 09:46.200
Cracking views of Cally Road.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.320
- Mm, you're not a vampire, Billy.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.560
You can open the curtains, you know.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.640
- Bloody hell, Lana.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.520
- See the mean machine's
had a bit of attention.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.320
Looks good.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
- Lana, keep 'em closed.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.640
(curtains sliding)

10:08.720 --> 10:09.960
Do us a favour, yeah?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.040
- What?

10:12.120 --> 10:13.880
- Don't mention this to Mum and Dad.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.960
- Fine.

10:16.840 --> 10:17.680
What are you doing, Billy?

10:17.760 --> 10:19.760
What have they ever done to you?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.320
- Killed Nut.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.840
People like them.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.680
We're at war, Lana.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.200
- War?

10:27.280 --> 10:28.040
You haven't got a clue.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.480
What do you know about war?

10:29.560 --> 10:31.640
War against Halal butchers?

10:32.520 --> 10:33.840
You don't know anything.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.360
It weren't them who killed Nut, you know.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.440
Grow up, Billy.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.560
- We done?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.640
- Yes, I am.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
(fan whirring)
(dramatic music)

10:52.280 --> 10:53.920
- [Ali] Please get me out of here, please.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Help me, please.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.480
- [Thom] Got 90 seconds, Lana!

10:59.560 --> 11:01.240
Hurry!

11:01.320 --> 11:04.120
- [Ali] (sobs) Someone help me.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.800
Please help me, please.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.960
- [Danny] Lana, we've got 30 seconds.

11:09.840 --> 11:10.600
- [Lana] Nearly there.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.440
I'm nearly there.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.360
Get off.
- Let's go!

11:13.440 --> 11:15.840
- [Ali] Don't leave me please! (screams)

11:15.920 --> 11:18.680
(bomb exploding)

11:28.400 --> 11:31.040
(phone chiming)

11:45.800 --> 11:48.480
(phone ringing)

11:48.560 --> 11:49.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.360
- [Lana] So what's happening?

11:50.440 --> 11:53.720
- The HMX-319 comes from Porton Down,

11:53.800 --> 11:55.240
but they couldn't tell me any more,

11:55.320 --> 11:57.320
wouldn't tell me any more.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.400
It's classified, Lana.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.680
- What level of
classification are we talking?

12:02.760 --> 12:04.760
- Well, beyond us bottom-feeders.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.360
- Okay.

12:08.440 --> 12:09.960
Okay, I'll speak to Hamilton or-

12:10.040 --> 12:10.920
- [Sonya] Thom?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.440
- Yeah, yeah.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.040
- What are we dealing with here, Wash?

12:15.120 --> 12:17.120
What bombers have this kind of access?

12:19.720 --> 12:21.720
- I don't know, Sonya.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.840
I'll give you a call in a bit, yeah?

12:23.920 --> 12:25.440
- Talk later.
- Okay, bye.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.760
- [Sonya] Bye.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.480
(phone beeping)

12:35.080 --> 12:37.840
(birds chirping)

12:55.840 --> 12:58.400
(zipper zipping)

12:58.480 --> 13:01.000
(dog barking)

13:04.960 --> 13:07.600
- [Dog Walker] Come on, come on.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.360
- [Thom] This is Thom Youngblood,
please leave a message.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.440
- Damn it.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.480
Hello. (whistles)

13:47.560 --> 13:48.880
Hello, mate.
- Heyo.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.960
- You alright?

13:51.040 --> 13:52.960
Oh, you're gorgeous.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.080
- Meet Nelson.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.960
Nelson, Wash.

13:56.040 --> 13:56.800
- [Lana] Is he yours?

13:56.880 --> 13:58.600
- No, no, he's Elly's.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.720
Sorry, I'm a bit...

13:59.800 --> 14:01.800
- [Lana] That's alright.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.400
- I'm just nipping out for a bit.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
- Okay.
- All right.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.600
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good, good.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.520
You found it alright?
- Yeah, fine.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.800
(crowd chattering)

14:21.840 --> 14:23.480
- It's good, innit?

14:23.560 --> 14:25.280
Vietnamese weasel coffee.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.600
- What?
- Trust me,

14:26.680 --> 14:27.800
you don't wanna know why it's called that.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.240
- Right, so you're a coffee expert?

14:30.320 --> 14:33.200
- Sure, though lime and soda is more

14:33.280 --> 14:34.880
of my specialist subject.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.000
- Oh, wish I was on them the other night.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.080
- Yeah, you were a mess.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.400
- I know. (laughs)

14:42.480 --> 14:43.880
- I mean, like, totally gone.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.160
Wow.
- All right, shut up.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.360
- If you can't cut loose at
moments like that, when can you?

14:49.440 --> 14:51.440
- Well, you didn't.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.880
- I've got too much up here.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.960
I just can't.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.360
Demons waiting to come
out and play, you know?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.680
You know I've still got an
evac pack next to my bed,

15:03.760 --> 15:05.680
just in case they call me out.

15:05.760 --> 15:06.760
It's tragic, I know.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.760
- No, I get it.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.320
I feel the same.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.120
It's hard to talk about, innit?

15:13.200 --> 15:14.440
I feel like if I told my mates,

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
they'd think I was losing it.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.680
- We lose part of ourselves out there.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.760
We never get it back.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.640
Hey, you know what we need, right?

15:26.720 --> 15:28.080
Come here.

15:28.160 --> 15:28.920
- What?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.080
What? (laughs)

15:30.160 --> 15:32.040
- Buckle up.

15:32.120 --> 15:32.960
- Where are we going?

15:33.040 --> 15:33.960
- Keep cool.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.480
- Oh my God, my coffee.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.160
- Here.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.440
- I don't understand where we are.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.240
- Might wanna put your
bag on the other shoulder.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.600
- What is this, mate?

15:40.680 --> 15:42.680
- Just trust me.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.160
(upbeat music)

15:47.240 --> 15:49.840
(door buzzing)

15:52.520 --> 15:54.080
(glasses clinking)

15:54.160 --> 15:56.160
Eh up, Maz.
- Hiya, Karl.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.600
- Welcome to paradise.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.080
Drink?
- Yeah.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.880
(balls clanging)

16:11.400 --> 16:16.240
- Oh, bollocks

16:16.320 --> 16:18.320
I set you up.
- [Lana] Thank you very much.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.200
- Shot.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.120
Oof, lot riding on this.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.120
- Mate, I've neutralised
an IED while the Taliban

16:28.200 --> 16:31.480
are taking pot shots at my head,
so I think I'll be alright.

16:34.200 --> 16:38.080
- Oh, you sharked me, giving it the old,

16:38.160 --> 16:40.160
"I haven't played for ages."

16:40.840 --> 16:42.840
Pretty good, Wash, I'll give you that.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.840
- No, keep your money.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.000
Double or quits.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.000
- All right, deal.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.360
This time I won't mess about.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.680
- Oh, fighting talk.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.840
You can rack up.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.960
Show off.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.080
Careful, steady, oh.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.160
Oh, damn it.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.680
So does it get easier?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.640
- Yeah.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.680
I mean no, still hurts,

17:27.840 --> 17:29.840
still feel like I'm lost.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.760
The army trained me, gave
me a purpose, and now...

17:33.840 --> 17:35.320
- Yeah, I get it.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.160
I had routine.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.960
I knew what I was doing.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.560
When I stepped up to a
device, something took over,

17:40.640 --> 17:42.720
my instincts kicked in.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.360
- 'Cause you've been
trained to behave like that,

17:45.440 --> 17:48.680
to be in a state of alertness, aggression.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.160
You can't just switch that
off when you get back.

17:51.240 --> 17:56.000
- When I joined 11 EOD, I
thought I was the dog's bollocks.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.360
- You, cocky?

17:57.440 --> 17:59.280
Never.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.600
- I nearly died on my first call out.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.560
I'd missed a secondary that
Terry had put in the hallway,

18:04.640 --> 18:06.640
stood back to admire my work.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.160
Nut screamed at me to freeze.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.880
I was inches away.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.320
- When you're looking at the big
picture, you miss the detail.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.640
- Yeah, Nut used to say we've
gotta be lucky every time

18:16.720 --> 18:19.600
we step up to a device, bomber's
only got to be lucky once.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.480
- And Nut's luck ran out.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.320
(balls banging)

18:39.520 --> 18:40.600
Bollocks.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.680
- I froze at that mosque, Karl.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.760
- That happens.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.200
- I'm scared the next time
I step up to a device,

18:50.280 --> 18:52.240
I'm not gonna know what I'm doing.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.520
I'm scared I've lost my nerve.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.840
I'm scared of taking up Nut's nine lives,

18:56.920 --> 18:58.920
scared I'm gonna lose my job.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.840
- Fear is what drives us on.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.080
It's when you lose that
fear that you need to worry.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.000
You've just lost your mate,
give yourself a break.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.080
- Nut would have dealt with that device.

19:11.160 --> 19:13.200
- You don't know that.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.680
Why beat yourself up over
things you can't change?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.920
- Right, let me kick your
arse at this fucking game.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.720
(balls banging)

19:30.800 --> 19:32.800
Oof.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.600
(cutlery scraping)

19:44.240 --> 19:46.240
- Mm, good news,

19:48.560 --> 19:51.360
managed to get clearer CCTV
pictures of the mosque bomber,

19:51.440 --> 19:53.440
a few streets away from the site.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.440
We were able to identify him
through our police records.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.680
Nic Roberts.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.880
Record as long as your arm.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.800
Violent assault, armed robbery.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.960
Member of English Flag 'til last year.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.040
- Any record of explosives training?

20:09.640 --> 20:11.640
- We're still digging.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.240
- [Lana] Bastard.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.360
- Yeah, we've got an alert out for him.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.840
There's been sightings across London.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.280
I mean, we're running
down all known addresses.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.800
Just a matter of time.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.280
- Great.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.760
(phone chiming)

20:36.600 --> 20:38.520
- [Thom] Who's that?

20:38.600 --> 20:39.680
- Er, it's just Danny.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.760
Some stupid GIF.

20:48.520 --> 20:51.600
Has Hamilton been able to
get in touch with Porton Down

20:51.680 --> 20:53.480
about HMX-319?

20:53.560 --> 20:55.440
- We're on it.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
You finished?

20:56.600 --> 20:58.600
- Yeah.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.440
(phone chiming)

21:07.520 --> 21:09.160
- [Thom] Is that Danny again?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.240
- Yeah.

21:15.480 --> 21:16.960
- Can I just, just for a minute?

21:17.040 --> 21:19.040
Sorry, just for a minute.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.800
It's been on my mind.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.040
We never had time to
talk about the mosque.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.440
- His name was Ali.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.600
He was married.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.320
He had two kids under
three and I failed him.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.160
I failed his family.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.560
- But you know you didn't.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.000
Firstly, you didn't, 'cause
you didn't have a choice.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.720
It was a complex device, Lana.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.040
There was literally nothing you could do.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.520
You were up against all of it.
- I know.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.600
I know.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.200
I know.

22:05.640 --> 22:06.760
- 'Cause if you weren't
in the right place,

22:06.840 --> 22:08.840
or you weren't feeling okay,

22:09.320 --> 22:11.960
you could feel like you could talk to me.

22:12.040 --> 22:17.040
- Yeah, 'course I would.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.160
- 'Cause I love you.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.600
I just wanna protect you.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.600
I've been thinking about it for a while,

22:35.280 --> 22:37.880
might be an idea for you to
move in here with me, you know.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.000
- What?
- Well, you like the place.

22:40.080 --> 22:44.360
- Well... (laughs)

22:44.440 --> 22:46.040
- It would be nice to
spend more time together.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.280
- Mm.
- Outside the office,

22:48.360 --> 22:50.640
away from work.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.120
We're sorted, then.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.160
(phone dinging)

23:08.120 --> 23:10.720
(door banging)

23:14.520 --> 23:16.800
- Oh, sorry, Lana, I didn't
realise you were here,

23:16.880 --> 23:17.880
otherwise I would have got you one.

23:17.960 --> 23:18.720
- You're all right.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.800
Don't worry about it.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.160
- Alright, Wash?

23:25.240 --> 23:26.680
- Yeah, I'm sorry I went off on one.

23:26.760 --> 23:27.680
It was out of order.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.760
- No danger, Wash, we've all been there.

23:30.720 --> 23:31.720
I shouldn't have had a go either.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.320
- There's some nutter out there.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.920
We need to be on our game.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.200
There's no point fighting
amongst ourselves.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.640
[Newsreader] Far-right group the Crusaders

23:40.720 --> 23:43.040
say they carried out the attack.

23:43.120 --> 23:46.160
Ayesha Campbell Khan, the
former shadow defence minister,

23:46.240 --> 23:49.360
is standing as the Labour
parliamentary candidate,

23:49.440 --> 23:51.080
leading a progressive alliance
made out of the Green Party,

23:51.160 --> 23:53.000
[John] So you think it's some
loon that's doing this?

23:53.080 --> 23:53.880
- [Newsreader] the Liberal Democrats

23:53.960 --> 23:55.960
- and other left-leaning groups.
[John] What do they reckon in CT?

23:56.040 --> 23:57.160
- They got a name or anything?
[Newsreader] They are,

23:57.240 --> 23:58.400
- in their own words,
[Lana] I don't know, don't ask me.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.080
- [Newsreader] "united against
the threat of the far right."

24:00.160 --> 24:01.840
- Doesn't your fella tell you anything?

24:01.920 --> 24:02.680
- What are you on about?
[Newsreader] Miss Campbell Khan

24:02.760 --> 24:03.880
- Come on.
[Newsreader] will visit worshipers

24:03.960 --> 24:04.840
[Newsreader] in the Amburiq Mosque, but earlier,

24:04.920 --> 24:08.360
we caught up with her on a
visit to the Westhaven Estate,

24:08.440 --> 24:10.240
devastated by the worst attack

24:10.320 --> 24:12.080
in this summer's bombing campaign.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.720
[Ayesha] - We all feel the pain of this community.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.720
[John] Oh, here we go.
[Ayesha] An attack on this community

24:15.800 --> 24:16.560
- Typical leftie siding with the enemy.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.240
- [Ayesha] is an attack on all of us.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.680
- Enemy?
[Ayesha] We must bring

24:19.760 --> 24:21.880
these murderers to justice.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.440
- [Newsreader] Ayesha Campbell
Khan visited Westhaven

24:24.520 --> 24:27.760
after the English Flag
candidate, Agatha Jack.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.600
- Danny, I'm off to BDC.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.440
See you in a bit.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.280
- Alright, mate.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.200
(camera clicking)

24:37.960 --> 24:40.080
- Oh God.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.520
- So that's our confirmation, then.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.720
HMX-319 compound.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.320
Exact same levels that were
used at Westhaven as well.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.280
- Yeah, we're dealing with
the same bombers at Westhaven

24:49.360 --> 24:51.240
and the mosque.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.440
The Crusaders are lying about
the mosque being revenge.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.840
It's been them all along.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.880
- No response from Porton Down?

24:56.960 --> 24:58.120
- No, Thom...

24:58.200 --> 25:01.000
Er, DI Youngblood hasn't even
asked Hamilton for clearance.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.760
(camera clicking)

25:03.840 --> 25:06.800
- Well, you need to tell
Thom to get on it, then.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.640
(camera clicking)

25:12.720 --> 25:14.680
- You know if I hadn't
told you about me and Thom,

25:14.760 --> 25:16.840
do you think you'd know?

25:16.920 --> 25:18.520
Is it that obvious?

25:18.600 --> 25:19.320
- No, not at all.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.160
Why?

25:20.240 --> 25:21.440
- It's just John said
something at work today.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.800
I don't know how he'd know, unless he...

25:22.880 --> 25:25.560
(phone buzzing)

25:27.280 --> 25:29.280
Danny.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.760
On my way.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.600
The Crusaders have planted another device.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.440
(dramatic music)

25:41.040 --> 25:41.880
This is EXPO 2.

25:41.960 --> 25:42.760
What can you see?

25:42.840 --> 25:44.480
- [Thom] Okay, so we've
got a stationary black van

25:44.560 --> 25:46.680
outside an LGBT pub, the Five Oaks,

25:46.760 --> 25:48.160
noticeable sag on the rear axle.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.640
- Right, get everyone as far
away from the van as possible.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.600
We're nearly there.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.640
- [Thom] Yeah, received.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.160
- Move, Danny, move.
- Copy.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.520
(police siren blaring)

25:59.680 --> 26:01.080
(crowd chattering)

26:01.160 --> 26:03.680
- Can you just keep them moving down?

26:03.760 --> 26:05.000
Further down!

26:05.080 --> 26:07.320
Take them beyond the cones!

26:08.520 --> 26:11.240
- Behind the cordon!
- Keep them moving!

26:11.320 --> 26:13.320
Thank you.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.280
Who's told them to come
through that cordon?

26:16.360 --> 26:21.360
Jesus Christ, as quick as you
can, Danny, straight to there.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.200
- Truck arrived at 6:00pm.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.320
Bar staff thought it was a
beer delivery 'til the driver

26:29.400 --> 26:30.200
did a runner.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.600
At 6:25pm, the Crusaders sent us

26:32.680 --> 26:35.280
an encrypted message,
claiming responsibility.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.480
- Is there anyone left inside?

26:36.560 --> 26:38.280
- No.
- Are you sure?

26:38.360 --> 26:40.120
- Yeah.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.200
- Danny, eyeballs.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.880
- What have we got?

26:45.960 --> 26:48.200
- We've got a big sag at the
rear axle of that black van.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.720
The pub's been evacuated
and everyone has been taken

26:49.800 --> 26:50.720
beyond the cordon.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.040
- It's well down on the back end.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.840
- Yeah, must be enough explosive in there

26:54.920 --> 26:56.920
to take down the whole street.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.480
(machine whirring)

27:18.400 --> 27:20.280
Alright, carefully open the door.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.880
(tense music)

27:43.920 --> 27:45.920
- Must be a rental.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
No one keeps their motor that clean.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.200
- No wires.

27:52.280 --> 27:53.680
Alright, let's push on.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.760
Come on out.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.280
(machine banging)

28:09.360 --> 28:11.680
(group gasping)

28:11.760 --> 28:13.360
- Get down! Take cover.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.320
Shot's fired, two shots fired.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.400
We've got a shooter somewhere.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.120
- Shit. Lana, robot's been hit.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.200
It's gone.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.800
- Fuck's sake.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.800
- [Thom] Can you see anything?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.960
Eyes on?
- Nothing, no visual.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.560
Sniper, top floor.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.800
- Central Eight Five, we
have visual confirmation.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.600
We have a sniper on the top floor

29:10.680 --> 29:13.840
of flats opposite the Five Oaks pub.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.400
Requesting additional firearms
support team immediately.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.360
- Preparing to move!

29:20.440 --> 29:22.440
- [PS Brown] Move, move!

29:30.640 --> 29:32.040
- This is Central Eight Five,

29:32.120 --> 29:33.800
requesting air support as well.

29:33.880 --> 29:36.280
- Randall, take Carney,
head towards the target.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.360
Go.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.000
- Shit.
- Air support,

29:40.080 --> 29:40.960
ETA three minutes.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.280
- Central Eight Five, received.

29:43.360 --> 29:48.360
Air support incoming, three minutes.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.400
(tyre popping)

29:53.000 --> 29:54.720
Hey.
- You all right?

29:54.800 --> 29:55.600
- The boot's fully loaded.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.520
If it functions, it will
total the whole street.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.280
A single shot could trigger the device.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.240
- Well, we know where he is.

30:01.320 --> 30:03.320
What do we do now?

30:03.640 --> 30:05.640
- Danny, pig stick bag, now.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.480
Robins, I need smoke grenades, now.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.560
- Get the smoke bombs out
of the back of the truck.

30:14.400 --> 30:19.400
- Come on, come on, come on.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.600
(gun banging)

30:24.200 --> 30:26.880
(siren blaring)

30:29.160 --> 30:30.200
We good?

30:30.280 --> 30:32.280
- [Danny] Yeah.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.720
- Sam, we're gonna redeploy
to the tower block.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.720
- Go.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.800
- Green Team, on me.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.320
(smoke bomb banging)

30:53.200 --> 30:55.880
(siren blaring)

31:00.960 --> 31:01.840
Which floor?

31:01.920 --> 31:04.280
- [PC Randall] Floor 17, top left.

31:04.360 --> 31:07.000
(siren blaring)

31:15.080 --> 31:16.360
(glass shattering)

31:16.440 --> 31:17.800
(gun clicking)

31:17.880 --> 31:20.800
(glass shattering)

31:34.480 --> 31:36.480
- Breach, breach!

31:38.680 --> 31:40.400
- Armed police.
- Armed police.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.920
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

31:43.000 --> 31:45.480
(gun banging)

31:47.360 --> 31:49.760
- Lana, the smoke's thinning.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.240
Lana, the smoke!

31:52.320 --> 31:54.520
- Danny, I'm nearly there.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.920
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

31:57.000 --> 31:57.880
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

31:57.960 --> 32:00.480
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

32:02.600 --> 32:04.600
- Charlie Delta, take the stairs.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.440
- Go!

32:06.520 --> 32:07.840
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

32:07.920 --> 32:10.320
- Armed police, armed police.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.120
(gun banging)

32:14.200 --> 32:15.440
- Danny!
- Yeah!

32:15.520 --> 32:16.280
- [Lana] I've got the shot.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.920
As soon as I hit the
corner, take the shot.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.120
- [Danny] Lana, you're in the danger zone.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.360
(helicopter whirring)

32:27.240 --> 32:29.800
(guns banging)

32:40.000 --> 32:42.760
- Take the shot, that's an order!

32:43.840 --> 32:45.760
- Circuit's good.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.960
Priming.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.040
Stand by.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.480
Firing.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.760
- This is EXPO 2.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.280
Device neutralised.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.360
Repeat, device neutralised.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.720
- Charlie Delta, I've got the lifts.

33:04.800 --> 33:07.480
Stay vigilant and await
further instructions.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.560
- Trojan Four Seven, received.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.280
- Take best cover.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.480
- Stay there!

33:35.560 --> 33:37.200
Down, now, move.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.720
- Get down, get down!

33:38.800 --> 33:40.280
Down, everybody, down!

33:40.360 --> 33:41.960
Trojan Four Seven to Trojan One,

33:42.040 --> 33:43.000
residents are trying to leave.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.080
- Let them through, but stay switched on.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.480
(gun clicking)

33:52.560 --> 33:53.640
(door squeaking)

33:53.720 --> 33:55.720
- Armed police!

33:59.280 --> 34:01.280
Armed police!

34:08.600 --> 34:10.600
- Steady.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.840
(elevator dinging)

34:19.160 --> 34:20.600
Stay still!

34:20.680 --> 34:23.160
(gun banging)

34:26.480 --> 34:27.400
Suspect down.

34:27.480 --> 34:28.800
Ground floor lifts.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.040
EXPO, on me now.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.360
- [Lana] EXPO 2, coming in.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.960
- Stay inside!

34:42.920 --> 34:44.920
Armed police!

35:06.280 --> 35:09.000
(gun clattering)

35:13.960 --> 35:17.520
- [Inspector Robins]
All yours, Washington.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.560
- Clear.
- Stand easy.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.240
- It's real.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.680
Danny, get ready to set up a controlled.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.560
- [Thom] Just pull that down for me.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.240
- You got an ID?

36:11.320 --> 36:14.160
- Think it's our man, Nic Roberts.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
- Yeah, I reckon so.

36:19.320 --> 36:21.320
Danny, make this quick, yeah?

36:21.640 --> 36:23.640
- [Danny] Yes, Lana.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.800
- I'll speak to Sonya about
forensics on the device.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.880
- Yeah, okay.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.400
It was good work back there
with the smoke grenades.

36:35.480 --> 36:36.440
Not exactly by the book though.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.200
This is not Afghanistan, Lana.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.920
- Yeah, well, it was a volatile device.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I had to move quick.

36:43.320 --> 36:44.840
- [Samira] Thom.

36:44.920 --> 36:45.840
- Yeah, coming.

36:45.920 --> 36:50.920
(helicopter whirring)
(siren blaring)

37:01.520 --> 37:03.520
- He wasn't responding to radio comms.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.040
The gaffer sent me up
here to check on him,

37:06.120 --> 37:08.400
and then he was just lying there.

37:11.600 --> 37:16.040
- Carney, you need to report
for forensic recovery.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.840
- Sir.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.920
- His missus is six months pregnant.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.960
- Brown, go and write up your report.

37:28.520 --> 37:30.240
Both of you get some rest.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.320
- Yeah, we've all had a long day.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.720
- Okay, lads, let's go.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.120
- Believe me when I say this,
we will catch these bastards.

37:51.320 --> 37:53.800
- Simon Randall was killed at the scene.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.360
Here's where we are.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.640
We now believe that there's
a single bombing campaign run

37:57.720 --> 37:59.880
by one group, the Crusaders.

37:59.960 --> 38:03.000
We know at least one member
of the cell, Nic Roberts,

38:03.080 --> 38:05.960
the suspect we shot, Crusader
number one, but there's

38:06.040 --> 38:08.600
at least one other member, possibly more.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.600
They've attacked a housing
estate, a mosque, now,

38:11.680 --> 38:14.280
the Five Oaks pub, an LGBT venue.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.320
We know they're highly skilled

38:15.400 --> 38:17.960
with both explosives and weapons.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.400
We know they're attacking
public sites in London,

38:20.480 --> 38:22.560
and we know they meant for
us to trace their getaway van

38:22.640 --> 38:26.000
to the supposed bomb factory,
but we don't know why,

38:26.080 --> 38:27.920
and we don't know why now.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Samira.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.280
- Andrew Phelan.

38:32.360 --> 38:35.440
We now know he was Nic Roberts'
cell mate in Ashcombe Prison

38:35.520 --> 38:37.400
for three months in 2015.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.400
We brought him in for an interview.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.240
- What's this about?

38:40.320 --> 38:41.840
I've told you everything.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.720
- Do you know this man?

38:43.800 --> 38:45.520
- Fuck.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.320
Nic, Nic Roberts.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.040
What's that psycho gotta do with anything?

38:49.120 --> 38:50.880
- This is the man we
think was behind the bombs

38:50.960 --> 38:54.920
at Amburiq Mosque, the Five
Oaks pub and Westhaven.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.840
- Westhaven?

38:59.200 --> 39:01.240
- Is there a reason you stopped
sharing a cell with him?

39:01.320 --> 39:04.320
- 'Cause he attacked me,
tried to stab me in the neck.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.480
He's a paranoid psycho.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.760
Thought I was grassing him up.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.400
- We think Nic Roberts had a
personal grudge against Phelan,

39:11.480 --> 39:14.360
which is why the Crusaders
chose to use him as a patsy.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.640
- Sacrifice him as an excuse
to kick off their campaign.

39:17.720 --> 39:21.000
- Nic Roberts ran at armed
police in a suicide belt.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.880
If the far-right are now
using suicide tactics,

39:23.960 --> 39:25.600
this is a worrying development.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.560
What does the CCTV from
the tower block tell us

39:27.640 --> 39:29.920
about the second Crusader
who killed Randall?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.320
- We have an extra police officer
who's been unaccounted for

39:32.400 --> 39:33.280
in our scene log.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.840
This is him leaving the building,

39:34.920 --> 39:38.040
and then he slips out with
the crowd, and from there,

39:38.120 --> 39:41.720
he gets into a white Prius,
Romeo, X-ray, one, zero,

39:41.800 --> 39:43.440
X-ray, Mike, golf.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.880
We're still searching for the vehicle,

39:44.960 --> 39:47.560
but obviously a Prius is a popular make.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.560
- We're looking for an Uber in a haystack.

39:49.640 --> 39:50.640
As we saw at Amburiq,

39:50.720 --> 39:53.600
the attackers know where
the CCTV cameras are.

39:53.680 --> 39:57.200
Forensics detected no gunshot
residue on Nic Roberts.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.280
Crusader Two was our gunman.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.360
- He knows how to move,

40:02.440 --> 40:04.640
knows how to behave
like a firearms officer.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.720
- Potentially someone with training, then.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.560
Okay, let's focus on Crusader number two,

40:08.640 --> 40:10.000
who is still at large.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.320
Get onto Thames House.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.840
Crosscheck all military
personnel, active and past,

40:13.920 --> 40:15.800
with membership records of English Flag.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.040
If that still leaves
us with a broad range,

40:18.120 --> 40:19.960
narrow it down specifically to personnel

40:20.040 --> 40:21.680
with firearms training.

40:21.760 --> 40:25.120
Let's check on every single
contact Nic Roberts has.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.760
Anyone he knew inside,

40:26.840 --> 40:29.640
anyone else who was in
the EF with him, friends,

40:29.720 --> 40:30.560
other gang members.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.040
This is a lot to organise
for a two-man cell.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.480
I want supply chains, hideouts.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.240
Get on your informers, ask around.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.520
Someone knows something.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.200
- One last thing.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.640
Nic Roberts didn't have
bomb-making training,

40:42.720 --> 40:44.320
so either attacker two does,

40:44.400 --> 40:47.360
or there's another member
of the cell, the bomb-maker.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.520
(solemn music)

40:48.600 --> 40:50.280
- Let's locate him and find out.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.480
- Ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.600
- [Officer] Yes, ma'am.

40:52.680 --> 40:57.680
(officers chattering)
(solemn music)

41:06.520 --> 41:09.440
(car door banging)

41:26.440 --> 41:29.080
(car exploding)

41:42.960 --> 41:45.080
- [Sonya] Hey.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.000
- Sonya, come and look at this.

41:47.080 --> 41:50.040
Feel like something's
staring me in the face.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.800
Any luck tracing the device
from the brewery van?

41:55.880 --> 41:57.880
- No, not yet.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.800
These are from Vauxhall, right?

41:59.880 --> 42:01.400
- Yeah.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.480
- Hang on.

42:05.080 --> 42:07.680
Look at this from the
first device at Westhaven,

42:07.760 --> 42:09.720
the direction that the wires are twisted,

42:09.800 --> 42:11.920
and the way the cables are cut.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.880
It's the same technique.

42:13.960 --> 42:15.960
- It's military training.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.560
Everyone that did high-level
training cuts their cables

42:18.640 --> 42:19.680
and twists their wires like that.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.760
That's how I do it.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.280
They know how to bypass our ECM,

42:26.360 --> 42:28.080
they know where to put the secondaries,

42:28.160 --> 42:30.000
they know call-out times, how we think,

42:30.080 --> 42:32.080
how we move, everything.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.840
It's got to be an inside man.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.000
- [Hass] Danny, Danny, bloody hell,

42:42.080 --> 42:42.840
have you got enough aftershave on?

42:42.920 --> 42:44.200
- [Danny] Why, what's wrong?

42:44.280 --> 42:45.160
- [Hass] Bit strong, no?

42:45.240 --> 42:46.600
- [Danny] Oh, please.

42:46.680 --> 42:49.000
- [Hass] Didn't know you could even shave.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.840
(men chattering)

42:54.880 --> 42:56.480
- Wash, coming for a sarnie?

42:56.560 --> 42:58.080
- Senior buys.

42:58.160 --> 42:58.960
- Nah, I've got paperwork.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.080
Next time.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.240
- Alright, see you later.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.000
- [Lana] See you in a bit.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.800
(dramatic music)

43:26.840 --> 43:29.680
(drawers sliding)

43:36.680 --> 43:39.240
(door banging)

43:49.880 --> 43:52.960
(container rattling)

44:10.160 --> 44:12.800
(book rustling)

44:44.040 --> 44:46.760
(phone clicking)

44:54.040 --> 44:56.640
(door banging)

45:05.800 --> 45:08.560
(dramatic music)
