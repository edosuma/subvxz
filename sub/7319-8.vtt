WEBVTT

00:11.867 --> 00:14.733
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...
THIS WHERE GEORGIE LIVES?

00:14.767 --> 00:17.733
OH, GEORGE.
(men) O'MALLEY!

00:17.767 --> 00:21.100
(George) CALLIE--SHE DUMPED ME.
DON'T CHASE ME ANYMORE UNLESS
YOU'RE READY TO CATCH ME.

00:21.133 --> 00:23.467
YOU ERASED MY NAME FROM BURKE'S
HUMPTY DUMPTY SURGERY.

00:23.500 --> 00:26.200
WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHY.
YOU OKAY?

00:26.233 --> 00:28.133
ABSOLUTELY.
STOP WORRYING.

00:28.167 --> 00:29.233
NOBODY HAS TO KNOW.

00:29.267 --> 00:31.433
I SAW YOU THERE, AT THE NURSING
HOME WITH MY MOTHER.

00:31.467 --> 00:33.200
SHE LIGHTS UP
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.367
MEREDITH,
I WANT TO START OVER.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.133
(Adele) YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO RETIRE.
I NEED MORE TIME.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.700
I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE TIME TO GIVE.

00:38.733 --> 00:41.367
IT'S ABOUT YOUR DAD,
GEORGE.
MY DAD?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.467
(Meredith) MANY PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW

00:47.500 --> 00:49.400
THAT THE HUMAN EYE
HAS A BLIND SPOT

00:49.433 --> 00:51.600
IN ITS FIELD OF VISION.

00:51.633 --> 00:54.500
THERE'S A PART OF THE WORLD
WE ARE LITERALLY BLIND TO.

00:54.533 --> 00:56.067
WHAT DID I SAY?

00:56.100 --> 00:57.033
SERIOUSLY?

00:57.067 --> 00:57.833
SERIOUSLY.

00:57.867 --> 00:59.767
SERIOUSLY.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.700
SERIOUSLY.
WE'RE TAKING IT SLOW.

01:01.733 --> 01:03.633
MM. I CAN TAKE IT SLOW.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.233
I CAN TAKE IT
INCREDIBLY SLOW.

01:05.267 --> 01:07.167
WE'RE TAKING IT SLOWER
THAN THAT.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.433
WE'RE STARTING FRESH.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.733
AND STARTING FRESH
MEANS NO SEX BECAUSE...

01:11.767 --> 01:13.667
BECAUSE WE STARTED WITH SEX
LAST TIME,

01:13.700 --> 01:15.600
AND IT DIDN'T GO VERY WELL.

01:15.633 --> 01:16.400
MM-HMM.

01:16.433 --> 01:18.267
PLUS, THE WAITING IS FUN.
MM-HMM.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.500
AND WE NEED FUN.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.433
FROM NOW ON I WANT TO BE
BRIGHT AND SHINY.

01:22.467 --> 01:23.800
MM. BRIGHT AND SHINY, HUH?

01:23.833 --> 01:24.767
MM-HMM.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.700
(both laugh)

01:26.733 --> 01:28.233
THE PROBLEM IS,

01:28.267 --> 01:31.100
SOMETIMES OUR BLIND SPOTS
SHIELD US FROM THINGS

01:31.133 --> 01:33.067
THAT REALLY
SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.600
MOM.

01:35.633 --> 01:38.733
***

01:38.767 --> 01:41.200
THE NURSES TELL ME

01:41.233 --> 01:42.600
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EATING.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.533
NO TIME. I'VE BEEN IN
THE O.R. ALL MORNING,

01:44.567 --> 01:46.400
AND I'VE GOT
BACK-TO-BACK SURGERIES

01:46.433 --> 01:48.333
THE REST OF THE DAY, SO...

01:48.367 --> 01:50.767
LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT
I HAVEN'T BEEN VISITING,

01:50.800 --> 01:53.700
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE BEEN--
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO CODDLE YOU RIGHT NOW.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.167
I'M TRYING
TO SAVE LIVES HERE.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.067
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
DO YOU?
DR. GREY.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.367
CHIEF.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.333
RICHARD.

02:00.367 --> 02:01.733
(laughs)

02:01.767 --> 02:04.233
(gasps)

02:04.267 --> 02:06.067
FOR ME?
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

02:06.100 --> 02:07.400
(laughs)

02:07.433 --> 02:09.333
UM...

02:09.367 --> 02:12.067
THE NURSES SAID
SHE HASN'T BEEN EATING.

02:12.067 --> 02:15.733
OH, YOU WONDERFUL MAN.

02:15.767 --> 02:18.067
I'M INTERRUPTING.
I'LL--I'LL GO.

02:18.067 --> 02:20.433
NO, CHIEF. UH...

02:20.467 --> 02:23.433
YOU STAY AND I'LL GO.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.367
SOMETIMES OUR BLIND SPOTS

02:25.400 --> 02:27.767
KEEP OUR LIVES
BRIGHT AND SHINY.

02:31.867 --> 02:33.333
TODAY IS THE DAY, PEOPLE.

02:33.367 --> 02:34.733
TODAY IS THE DAY

02:34.767 --> 02:37.800
WHEN DARK-AND-TWISTY MEREDITH
DISAPPEARS FOREVER

02:37.833 --> 02:40.667
AND BRIGHT-AND-SHINY MEREDITH
TAKES HER PLACE.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.200
YOU'RE PROBABLY

02:42.233 --> 02:44.500
NOT GONNA WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH ME ANYMORE

02:44.533 --> 02:46.433
BECAUSE THE SHEER INTENSITY
OF MY HAPPINESS

02:46.467 --> 02:48.500
IS GONNA MAKE
YOUR TEETH HURT.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.433
BUT THAT'S OKAY
BECAUSE LIFE IS GOOD.

02:50.467 --> 02:53.167
LIFE IS GOOD.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.567
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:54.600 --> 02:56.300
GEORGE'S DAD
GOT ADMITTED LAST NIGHT.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.733
OH, MY GOD.
IS HE OKAY?

02:57.767 --> 03:00.067
OH, NO, HE'S FINE.
HE, UH, PASSED OUT,

03:00.100 --> 03:01.800
HIT THE FLOOR
AND FRACTURED HIS CLAVICLE.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.267
YEAH, BUT HIS CLAVICLE'S FINE.
CALLIE SAID IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

03:04.300 --> 03:07.167
ARE THOSE HIS A.M. LABS?
YEAH, COMPLAINING OF
SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.733
HE DOESN'T HAVE
PERITONEAL SIGNS. THAT'S GOOD.
HAS ANYBODY SEEN...

03:10.767 --> 03:12.800
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT IT.
DON'T YOU THINK
ME READING IT

03:12.833 --> 03:15.533
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN YOU READING IT?

03:15.567 --> 03:16.600
SURE. FINE.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.367
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.400
YOU'RE ON SCUT TODAY.
YOU'LL BE DISTRACTED.

03:20.433 --> 03:24.233
NO, I WON'T.
FAMILY MEMBERS DO NOT
TREAT FAMILY MEMBERS. SCUT.

03:24.267 --> 03:27.233
I'M SCRUBBING IN ON A SURGERY
WITH DR. BURKE THIS MORNING.

03:27.267 --> 03:29.800
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.167
KAREV, SLOAN.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.367
GREY, PIT.
STEVENS, SHADOW KAREV.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.433
AND LET ME REMIND YOU AGAIN
OF THE RULES OF YOUR PROBATION.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.300
I THINK SHE KNOWS
THE RULES, DR. BAILEY.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.467
NO TOUCHING PATIENTS,
NO TALKING TO PATIENTS,

03:42.500 --> 03:45.400
NO ROLLING YOUR EYES
AT THE PATIENTS

03:45.433 --> 03:47.067
OR YOUR SUPERIORS.

03:51.133 --> 03:52.200
(whistles)

03:52.233 --> 03:54.200
(laughs) HEY.
GOOD MORNING, ADDISON.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.467
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?
IT IS A GREETING...

03:56.500 --> 04:00.333
USED IN CIVILIZED CULTURES
BY THEIR CIVILIZED INHABITANTS.

04:00.367 --> 04:01.533
YOU'RE SMILING.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.200
YEAH. IT'S CALLED HAPPINESS.

04:03.233 --> 04:05.067
I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE IT.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.833
WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

04:06.867 --> 04:08.767
WE'RE, UH, BEING MATURE
ABOUT THIS?

04:08.800 --> 04:10.300
YES, WE ARE GOING TO

04:10.333 --> 04:11.667
PEACEFULLY COEXIST
IN THIS HOSPITAL,

04:11.700 --> 04:13.600
UNLESS YOU'VE RECONSIDERED
MOVING BACK TO NEW YORK.

04:13.633 --> 04:14.700
(chuckles)

04:14.733 --> 04:16.533
OKAY, THEN.
WE PEACEFULLY COEXIST.

04:16.567 --> 04:17.600
INTERESTING.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.133
YES. WE'RE ADULTS.
WE'RE EDUCATED.

04:19.167 --> 04:21.067
I THINK WE'RE CAPABLE
OF MANY, MANY THINGS.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.700
COME ON.
LET'S SHAKE ON IT.

04:23.733 --> 04:26.600
SO I'M STILL WEARING
THE RINGS.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.533
WELL...
I THINK THEY'RE STUCK.

04:28.567 --> 04:31.400
HAVE YOU TRIED SOAP?
I HEAR IT'S GOOD AND SLIPPERY.

04:31.433 --> 04:32.467
(laughs)

04:32.500 --> 04:35.367
(chuckles) YOU ARE
A VERY STRANGE PERSON, DEREK.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.167
I AM JUST BRIGHT
AND SHINY, ADDISON,

04:38.200 --> 04:40.633
BRIGHT AND SHINY.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.167
NO, SO THEN I JUST--I POPPED
HIS SHOULDER RIGHT BACK IN.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.067
HE DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH.
YOUR BROTHER IS HARD-CORE.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.367
GEORGE?
(George)
CALLIE, WHAT ARE...

04:48.400 --> 04:50.667
(Miranda) LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
A FULL HOUSE, MR. O'MALLEY.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.633
JUST WAITING ON THE WIFE.
SHE'S IN D.C.,

04:52.667 --> 04:55.133
UH, CHAPERONING
A FIELD TRIP.
YEAH, SHE'S COMING IN TODAY.

04:55.167 --> 04:57.200
(Callie)
HIS CLAVICLE'S STILL HURTING,

04:57.233 --> 04:59.267
SO I ADDED p.r.n.
MORPHINE EVERY FOUR HOURS.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.833
AND I'VE SCHEDULED YOUR
ENDOSCOPY FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.767
AN ENDO-WHAT?
SCOPE.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.700
THAT'S LIKE--
LIKE A CAMERA.

05:05.733 --> 05:07.700
THAT SOUNDS DANGEROUS.
IS THAT DANGEROUS?
NO, IT'S NOT DANGEROUS.

05:07.733 --> 05:10.067
OKAY, I DIDN'T ASK YOU.
I ASKED THE DOCTOR.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.333
(Ronny) YEAH,
LET THE DOCTOR SPEAK, GEORGIE.

05:12.367 --> 05:13.733
WHITE COAT. LET'S LOOK
AT THE WHITE COAT.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.733
WHAT ABOUT AN X-RAY?
'CAUSE I HAD THAT ONCE,

05:15.767 --> 05:17.533
AND I FEEL LIKE HE--
SHUT UP, BOTH OF YOU.
SHUT UP.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.067
O'MALLEY.
(all) WHAT?

05:19.100 --> 05:20.533
UH, N--

05:20.567 --> 05:23.100
(laughs)
SINCE WE'RE ALL...

05:23.133 --> 05:26.133
(Jerry) WELL, SHE'S NOT
TALKING TO YOU.
(Mr. O'Malley laughs)

05:27.300 --> 05:31.167
AH, EXCELLENT.
MY INVALUABLE INTERN.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.333
IS IT "BRING A HOT BLONDE
TO WORK" DAY? NO ONE TOLD ME.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.667
(Izzie and Alex laugh)

05:35.700 --> 05:37.233
(coughs)
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

05:37.267 --> 05:39.167
DR. STEVENS IS
SHADOWING ME TODAY, SO...

05:39.200 --> 05:41.300
WHICH ONE OF THESE CASES
DO YOU NEED US ON?

05:41.333 --> 05:43.300
IT'S A REALLY TRAGIC ONE.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.333
I FOUND OUT JUST THIS MORNING
THAT I HAVE OVER TWO WEEKS

05:46.367 --> 05:49.233
WORTH OF DRY CLEANING THAT
NEEDS TO BE PICKED UP... STAT.

05:49.267 --> 05:50.733
COOL. THAT'S IT?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.600
SEE? WE'RE LIKE A WELL-OILED
MACHINE, YOU AND ME.

05:53.633 --> 05:56.067
I ALSO NEED YOU TWO
TO GET ME A SANDWICH

05:56.067 --> 05:57.700
FROM THAT PATHETIC EXCUSE
FOR A DELI.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.500
YOU KNOW THE ONE I LIKE,
KAREV.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.433
OH, BUT GO EASY
ON THE MAYO THIS TIME.

06:01.467 --> 06:04.533
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO KILL ME.

06:04.567 --> 06:07.133
(Izzie scoffs)

06:07.167 --> 06:09.067
I DON'T SEE WHY I CAN'T
AT LEAST HELP

06:09.100 --> 06:10.467
WITH MY DAD'S ENDOSCOPY.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.400
WHAT ABOUT
"NO WORKING WITH FAMILY"

06:12.433 --> 06:13.733
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

06:13.767 --> 06:15.767
I'M NOT ASKING TO DO
THE PRO--
FINE.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.100
PICK AN INTERN.

06:18.133 --> 06:19.500
WHAT?

06:19.533 --> 06:21.067
I'M BEING KIND.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.367
YOU WANT AN INTERN ASSIGNED
TO YOUR DAD'S CASE? FINE.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.733
WHO DO YOU WANT?

06:24.767 --> 06:27.067
RIGHT NOW.
PICK AN INTERN.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.167
(Preston) EXCELLENT.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.333
NOW WE WANT TO PLACE
A PARTIAL OCCLUDING CLAMP

06:34.367 --> 06:37.300
ON THE AORTA.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.600
(Preston) SLOWLY.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.133
GOOD.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.600
(Preston) NOW MAKE SURE
ALL THE GRAFTS ARE DE-AIRED

06:44.633 --> 06:48.067
BEFORE YOU REMOVE THE VENOUS
AND AORTIC CANNULAS.

06:49.767 --> 06:52.500
HE'S LETTING HER DECANNULATE
THE HEART BY HERSELF?

06:52.533 --> 06:54.700
FREAKIN' UNBELIEVABLE,
HUH?

06:57.367 --> 07:00.833
(siren wails)

07:00.867 --> 07:02.833
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

07:02.867 --> 07:04.567
(man) MIA HANSON...

07:04.600 --> 07:06.500
5-YEAR-OLD FEMALE,
CRUSH INJURY TO THE ABDOMEN,

07:06.533 --> 07:07.800
BLUNT TRAUMA TO THE HEAD.

07:07.833 --> 07:10.400
B.P. 90 OVER 60,
PULSE 110.
HOW WAS SHE INJURED?

07:10.433 --> 07:12.800
BACKED OVER
BY HER MOM'S S.U.V.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.267
SHE'S, UM--HER BLOOD TYPE
IS A-NEGATIVE,

07:14.300 --> 07:16.200
AND SHE'S ALLERGIC
TO PENICILLIN AND, UM, WHEAT.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.133
I AM SO SORRY, MIA.
I AM SO SORRY, BABY.

07:18.167 --> 07:20.300
HAS SHE HAD ANYTHING
TO EAT TODAY?

07:20.333 --> 07:22.467
UH, CEREAL THIS MORNING
AROUND 6:30.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.733
OKAY, MRS. HANSON, WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

07:24.767 --> 07:26.200
I AM MRS. HANSON.
MIA IS MY CHILD.

07:26.233 --> 07:30.200
ANNA IS JUST THE NANNY
WHO RAN OVER MY DAUGHTER!

07:30.233 --> 07:32.067
GOD.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.400
(Derek) I'M GONNA EXAMINE
YOUR NECK, OKAY?

07:44.433 --> 07:46.300
IT'S OKAY, MIA.
MY NAME IS MEREDITH.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.767
AND DR. SHEPHERD
AND DR. BAILEY

07:47.800 --> 07:49.633
ARE JUST TRYING TO SEE
WHERE YOU'RE HURT, OKAY?
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

07:49.667 --> 07:52.133
SHE RAN OVER MIA
IN THE DRIVEWAY.
SHE WHAT?

07:52.167 --> 07:54.467
MIA WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.733
MRS. HANSON TOLD ME
TO GO GET SOME MILK, AND I--

07:57.767 --> 07:59.300
I DIDN'T SEE HER.
HOW DO YOU NOT SEE A CHILD

07:59.333 --> 08:01.667
STANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY?
SHH.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.433
AND WHERE WERE YOU?
WHAT?

08:03.467 --> 08:04.800
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THAT YOU
COULDN'T WATCH MIA

08:04.833 --> 08:07.067
FOR FIVE MINUTES?
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
IN COURT.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.700
OH, YOU'RE ON THE PHONE--
I WAS LETTING THEM KNOW
THAT I WAS GOING TO BE LATE.

08:09.733 --> 08:11.667
INSTEAD OF WATCHING MIA.
OH! OH, SO NOW
THIS IS MY FAULT?

08:11.700 --> 08:13.233
IT'S THE CAR'S FAULT, OKAY?

08:13.267 --> 08:16.100
S.U.V.s HAVE BLIND SPOTS
THE SIZE OF JUPITER.

08:16.133 --> 08:18.267
AND YELLING AND FIGHTING
AND PLACING BLAME

08:18.300 --> 08:20.767
IS NOT GONNA HELP
YOUR CHILD.
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.333
SHE HAS BLOOD
IN HER EAR CANAL.

08:22.367 --> 08:24.300
WE NEED TO GET HER UPSTAIRS
FOR A C.T.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.500
OKAY, READY?

08:26.533 --> 08:28.567
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
BABY GIRL.
GET AWAY FROM HER.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.767
NOW.
WHAT?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.767
GET OUT!

08:35.400 --> 08:37.433
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU--

08:37.467 --> 08:39.500
YOU JUST DECANNULATED A HEART
ALL BY YOURSELF.

08:39.533 --> 08:41.433
I DIDN'T DECANNULATE
THE HEART BY MYSELF.

08:41.467 --> 08:44.433
I ASSISTED DR. BURKE,
WHO DECANNULATED A HEART.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.367
WHY ARE YOU BEING MODEST?
MODEST LOOKS WEIRD ON YOU.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.600
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
GEORGE.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.733
HOW'S YOUR FATHER, O'MALLEY?
ANYTHING NEW?

08:50.767 --> 08:52.467
HE NEEDS AN ENDOSCOPY,
AND, UH,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.400
BAILEY WON'T LET ME BE
THE INTERN ON THIS CASE,

08:54.433 --> 08:56.367
BUT SHE SAID
I COULD PICK SOMEONE.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.300
I WAS WONDERING IF CRISTINA
COULD BE THE INTERN

08:58.333 --> 08:59.367
ON THIS CASE.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.233
(Cristina) WHY?
THAT SHOULDN'T BE
A PROBLEM.

09:01.267 --> 09:02.300
UH, UH, YES IT IS.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.333
WE HAVE A CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY
SCHEDULED AT NOON.

09:04.367 --> 09:06.067
OH.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.767
I'LL PUSH IT. O'MALLEY'S FATHER
DESERVES THE BEST.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.167
(George)
THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.667
NOT A PROBLEM, O'MALLEY.

09:12.700 --> 09:14.800
YOUR DAD BETTER GET

09:14.833 --> 09:17.467
SOMETHING INTERESTING
WRONG WITH HIM REAL FAST.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.667
YOU'RE SICK.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.067
SHE'S A SICK,
HORRIBLE PERSON.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.300
(elevator bell dings)

09:22.333 --> 09:24.233
TELL ME AGAIN WHY YOU
PUT UP WITH THIS CRAP?

09:24.267 --> 09:26.167
BECAUSE ONE OF THESE DAYS,
HE'S GONNA CRACK

09:26.200 --> 09:28.167
AND LET ME IN ON A CASE.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.100
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO
PLASTICS THAT BADLY?

09:30.133 --> 09:31.500
THERE YOU ARE.

09:31.533 --> 09:34.200
WHAT, DID YOU GO ALL THE WAY
TO NEW YORK FOR MY PASTRAMI?

09:34.233 --> 09:36.833
EXTRA SPICY, EXTRA LETTUCE,
LIGHT ON THE MAYO.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.067
MARK...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:39.067 --> 09:41.467
LUNCH. WANT MY PICKLE?

09:41.500 --> 09:43.467
SEATTLE GRACE
IS A TEACHING HOSPITAL

09:43.500 --> 09:46.333
AND PART OF YOUR JOB
IS TO TEACH.

09:46.367 --> 09:49.300
YOUR INTERNS AREN'T
YOUR SLAVES.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.267
FINE.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.200
NO PICKLE FOR YOU.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.167
DID YOU SEE THAT?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.733
HMM?
SLOAN.

09:58.767 --> 10:00.667
HE'S USING HIS INTERNS
TO PICK UP HIS DRY CLEANING

10:00.700 --> 10:03.167
AND HIS LUNCH.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.567
I'VE GOT TO DO AN ENDOSCOPY.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.433
(pager beeps)

10:07.467 --> 10:10.333
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
WITH THE MEN IN THIS HOSPITAL?

10:10.367 --> 10:11.700
HOW YOU DOING,
MR. JEFFRIES?

10:11.733 --> 10:13.233
OH, FRANK'S DOING OKAY.

10:13.267 --> 10:16.200
HE'D BE DOING A LOT BETTER
IF THE TWINS WERE EVEN.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.033
UH, TWINS?

10:18.067 --> 10:19.500
FRANK'S NEW PECS.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.733
WHO IS FRANK?

10:21.767 --> 10:23.700
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM.
(makes clicking noise)

10:23.733 --> 10:27.200
FRANK, THESE ARE INTERNS. I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING THEM.

10:27.233 --> 10:29.800
APPARENTLY, THIS IS
A TEACHING HOSPITAL. KAREV?

10:29.833 --> 10:32.700
YEAH, UH... FRANK JEFFRIES
IS POST-OP DAY THREE

10:32.733 --> 10:34.367
FOR PECTORAL ENHANCEMENT
SURGERY.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.233
THERE WAS A SLIGHT COMPLICATION
WHEN A SEROMA FORMED.

10:37.267 --> 10:39.500
(yawns) WHAT IS A SEROMA?
BUILD UP OF BLOOD AND FLUID
UNDER THE SKIN.

10:39.533 --> 10:41.567
(whispers) SORRY.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.833
AND THAT CONCLUDES
TODAY'S TEACHING.

10:43.867 --> 10:45.833
A TUBE WAS INSERTED
INTO MR. JEFFRIES' CHEST

10:45.867 --> 10:47.667
TO DRAIN THE EXCESS FLUID.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.733
I WANT YOU TO MONITOR HIM,
CHECK THE TUBE FOR FLUID OUTPUT

10:49.767 --> 10:51.800
AND CHANGE HIS DRESSINGS.

10:51.833 --> 10:54.367
DR. STEVENS...
I GUESS YOU CAN WATCH.
HMM.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.800
ACTUALLY, DR. STEVENS
IS AN EXCELLENT DOCTOR.

10:55.833 --> 10:58.567
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I HEAR.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.100
YOU DECANNULATED A HEART
THIS MORNING.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.467
YEAH, I DIDN'T DECAN--

11:08.500 --> 11:09.833
YES, YOU DID.

11:09.867 --> 11:11.767
AND WHEN BURKE AND I
WERE FISHING, I...

11:11.800 --> 11:13.700
I NOTICED SOMETHING WEIRD
WITH HIS HAND,

11:13.733 --> 11:15.633
LIKE IT HAD A SPASM
OR SOMETHING.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.133
I'M SORRY. WHY ARE YOU
EVEN SAYING THAT?

11:18.167 --> 11:19.500
THAT IS NOT FUNNY.

11:19.533 --> 11:21.833
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS FUNNY.
I SAID IT WAS WEIRD.

11:21.867 --> 11:25.233
AND HIM LETTING YOU
DECANNULATE A HEART,

11:25.267 --> 11:27.167
THAT'S WEIRD.
YOU SHOULD SIT
WITH YOUR FATHER.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.167
'CAUSE IF YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO WORRY ABOUT,

11:29.200 --> 11:30.533
YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT HIM.

11:30.567 --> 11:32.467
MY FATHER IS FINE.
HE'S GOOD--

11:32.500 --> 11:33.833
I HAVE A GOOD--

11:33.867 --> 11:35.367
DON'T--THIS IS BURKE.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.100
DID YOU THINK THAT--

11:44.867 --> 11:46.367
(Mia) I want Anna.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.167
(Meredith) It's okay, Mia.
Mommy and Daddy are here.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.133
(moans)
AND WE ARE JUST GOING
TO TAKE SOME PICTURES.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.533
OKAY? THIS IS A BIG CAMERA.

11:53.567 --> 11:56.100
I DON'T LIKE IT.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.233
Grey...

11:57.267 --> 11:59.167
KEEP HER STILL.
Mia, Baby...

11:59.200 --> 12:01.100
IT'S OKAY. MOMMY'S HERE.

12:01.133 --> 12:03.700
WHERE'S ANNA?

12:03.733 --> 12:07.467
YOU NEED TO LIE
VERY STILL, OKAY?

12:07.500 --> 12:09.733
I WANT ANNA.

12:09.767 --> 12:12.700
HOW ABOUT I SING YOU
THE GOOD NIGHT SONG?

12:12.733 --> 12:17.467
AND YOU PRETEND IT'S BEDTIME
AND STAY SUPER STILL, OKAY?

12:17.500 --> 12:19.067
OKAY.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.800
* GOOD NIGHT, MIA

12:20.833 --> 12:23.333
* GOOD NIGHT, MOMMY

12:23.367 --> 12:25.667
* GOOD NIGHT, DADDY

12:25.700 --> 12:27.567
NO, YOU'RE SINGING IT WRONG.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.067
I AM?
I'M SINGING IT WRONG? UM...

12:30.067 --> 12:31.500
I WANT ANNA.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.333
(Mr. Hanson) SHE'S IN
THE WAITING ROOM, HONEY.

12:33.367 --> 12:34.567
I'LL--I'LL GET HER.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.667
JOHN!

12:35.700 --> 12:37.600
LET'S ALL SING IT
TOGETHER, OKAY?

12:37.633 --> 12:41.267
NO. I WANT ANNA.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.233
(Ronny) SO NOW--BUT YOU PICK--
YOU PICK A CAR.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.733
OKAY. UM...

12:48.767 --> 12:52.600
MM. 1968 MUSTANG GT
390 FASTBACK.

12:52.633 --> 12:54.467
THAT'S INTERESTING.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.267
(laughs)

12:55.300 --> 12:58.333
NO, THAT IS HOT.
THAT IS VERY HOT.

12:58.367 --> 13:00.133
CAR.

13:00.167 --> 13:01.700
UH-HUH.
MM-HMM.

13:01.733 --> 13:03.600
(Ronny laughs)
HEY, GEORGIE. HOW'S DAD?

13:03.633 --> 13:06.733
THEY'RE NOT DONE YET,
BUT I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.733
CAN I TALK TO YOU,
DR. TORRES?
SURE.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.700
EXCUSE ME.
(laughs)

13:11.733 --> 13:13.067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:13.100 --> 13:14.833
I'M TALKING TO YOUR BROTHERS.

13:14.867 --> 13:17.167
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
IT'S OKAY. I DON'T MIND.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.433
I'M PRETTY SURE RONNY AND JERRY
BOTH HAVE A THING FOR ME.

13:19.467 --> 13:23.500
I WAS GONNA GO WITH JERRY
UNTIL HE WENT ALL 1957 BEL-AIR.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.133
I WAS LIKE, "REALLY?"

13:25.167 --> 13:27.267
THANK YOU FOR TRYING
TO HELP OUT WITH MY FAMILY,

13:27.300 --> 13:29.067
BUT IT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY.

13:29.100 --> 13:33.200
GEORGE... I'M KIDDING
ABOUT YOUR BROTHERS. COME ON.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.067
CALLIE, I'M SERIOUS.

13:35.067 --> 13:36.800
I CAN HANDLE MY FAMILY
ON MY OWN.

13:36.833 --> 13:39.167
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME,
REMEMBER?

14:04.800 --> 14:07.700
(Miranda) WE MAY HAVE TO DO
A PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY.

14:07.733 --> 14:10.333
(Meredith) DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN SAVE MIA'S KIDNEY?

14:10.367 --> 14:12.267
ONLY IF WE CAN CONTROL
THE BLEEDERS.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.500
HERE, CAUTERIZE AS I GO.

14:13.533 --> 14:16.067
THANK YOU.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.233
YOU POOR BABY.

14:17.267 --> 14:19.167
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
AN EASY RECOVERY.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.733
WELL, WITH PARENTS LIKE THAT,

14:21.767 --> 14:23.333
SHE DIDN'T HAVE IT EASY
TO BEGIN WITH.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.267
PEOPLE DO THE BEST THEY CAN,
DR. GREY.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.100
THEY DON'T KNOW
THEIR KID'S BLOOD TYPE.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.500
THEY DON'T KNOW
HER FAVORITE SONG.

14:30.533 --> 14:31.767
PEOPLE WANT
HIGH-POWERED CAREERS,

14:31.800 --> 14:33.467
I GET THAT,

14:33.500 --> 14:36.533
BUT THEY SHOULD THINK TWICE
BEFORE HAVING KIDS.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.533
OH! I-I'M SORRY.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.233
I DIDN'T MEAN--

14:40.267 --> 14:42.167
WHAT, THAT I SHOULD BE HOME
WITH MY BABY

14:42.200 --> 14:44.100
INSTEAD OF HERE
WITH THIS LITTLE GIRL

14:44.133 --> 14:46.167
AND A SURGICAL INTERN WHO CAN'T
CAUTERIZE THE BLEEDERS?

14:46.200 --> 14:47.700
DR. BAILEY--

14:47.733 --> 14:49.633
IF I WERE YOU, DR. GREY,
I WOULD KEEP MY EYE

14:49.667 --> 14:52.133
ON THE SURGICAL AREA
AND MY MOUTH SHUT.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.600
O'MALLEY. HOW'S IT GOING
WITH YOUR DAD?

15:05.633 --> 15:07.533
GOOD. THE CHIEF'S DOING
AN ENDOSCOPY ON HIM,

15:07.567 --> 15:09.233
SO HE'S IN GOOD HANDS.

15:09.267 --> 15:10.267
THAT WAS AN AMAZING SURGERY
THIS MORNING,

15:10.300 --> 15:12.067
THE WAY YOU LET CRISTINA
DECANNULATE THAT HEART.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.833
SHE SHOWS TREMENDOUS PROMISE
IN CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY.

15:14.867 --> 15:16.767
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T DO IT.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.700
PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT
TO RUB IT IN.

15:18.733 --> 15:20.067
MAKE ANYONE JEALOUS.

15:20.100 --> 15:23.400
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CRISTINA.

15:23.433 --> 15:25.333
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU?

15:25.367 --> 15:28.067
SURE. IT'S FINE.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.500
'CAUSE IF ANYTHING
EVER WASN'T,

15:29.533 --> 15:32.133
YOU KNOW YOU COULD
TALK TO ME, RIGHT?

15:32.167 --> 15:34.667
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT LATELY, GETTING SHOT,

15:34.700 --> 15:37.233
ALL THAT--
IT CAN'T BE EASY.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.200
YEAH.

15:40.233 --> 15:43.133
HAS IT NOT BEEN EASY?

15:43.167 --> 15:45.833
IT'S FINE.
SEND MY BEST TO YOUR DAD.

15:45.867 --> 15:47.500
OKAY.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.433
HEY.

15:51.467 --> 15:52.833
HEY.

15:52.867 --> 15:54.767
THIS CIVIL AND MATURE THING,
HOW FAR DOES IT GO?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.667
MEANING WHAT?

15:55.700 --> 15:57.767
MEANING IS IT PLEASANTRIES
IN THE HALLWAY,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.167
OR DO WE ACTUALLY INTERACT?

15:59.200 --> 16:02.100
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
THAT SOUNDS DRASTIC.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT RICHARD.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.800
HE SEEMS DOWN TO ME.
WELL, HE'S SEPARATED
FROM HIS WIFE.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.733
THAT USUALLY DOESN'T MAKE
A PERSON GIDDY,

16:06.767 --> 16:08.300
EXCEPT IN MY CASE.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.233
I THINK HE COULD USE
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

16:10.267 --> 16:11.367
SO TALK TO HIM.
NO, I THINK
WE BOTH SHOULD.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.367
YOU KNOW, SO IT'S CLEAR THAT
HE HAS PEOPLE TO TURN TO.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.133
BECAUSE HE'S
A LITTLE DEPRESSED?

16:16.167 --> 16:18.233
WELL, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
HE'S SPOKEN TO ADELE IN WEEKS,

16:18.267 --> 16:19.533
AND HE'S OUR FRIEND,

16:19.567 --> 16:21.667
AND HE HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR US.
WHEN YOU GET DIVORCED,

16:21.700 --> 16:24.167
DOESN'T THAT MEAN YOUR WIFE IS
SUPPOSED TO STOP NAGGING YOU?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.500
MAYBE IF YOU TOOK THE RINGS OFF
IT WOULD HELP.

16:26.533 --> 16:29.400
ARE YOU GONNA COME WITH ME
TO SEE THE CHIEF OR NOT?
FINE. YES. OKAY.

16:29.433 --> 16:30.767
THANK YOU.
LET'S DO IT.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.667
AND I WILL TRY SOAP.
FOR THE RINGS, I MEAN.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.267
OKAY.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.567
OH, YEAH.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.067
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.500
OH, LOOK AT YOU.

16:44.533 --> 16:46.400
OH, D-DO THEY STILL
LOOK LOPSIDED?

16:46.433 --> 16:47.567
I MEAN, FROM THE SEROMA.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.567
NO, IT LOOKS LIKE MOST OF
THE SWELLING HAS GONE DOWN.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.733
YEAH? OH, YEAH.
(chuckles)

16:52.767 --> 16:56.067
HEY, UH, DR. STEVENS, WOULD YOU
TAKE A LOOK AT THE TWINS?

16:56.067 --> 16:58.533
FRANK WOULD LIKE
A WOMAN'S PERSPECTIVE.

16:58.567 --> 17:01.300
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING.
OH. OH, NICE.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.200
UH...

17:03.233 --> 17:05.567
YEAH, IT LOOKS PRETTY EVEN
TO ME, VERY DEFINED.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.767
AND THE REDNESS SHOULD GO AWAY
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.433
GOOD. GOOD.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.800
FRANK GOT THEM
FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND.

17:11.833 --> 17:14.233
HE DOESN'T WANT HER TO SEE 'EM
TILL THEIR PERFECT.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.567
YOUR GIRLFRIEND ASKED YOU
TO GET PEC IMPLANTS?
OH, NO. NO, NO.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.100
FRANK'S GIRLFRIEND JOINED A GYM,
GOT A TRAINER NAMED LARS.

17:19.133 --> 17:21.333
WHAT KIND OF NAME
IS THAT--LARS?

17:21.367 --> 17:22.767
SO YOU GOT FAKE PECS

17:22.800 --> 17:25.133
'CAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS
OF A GUY WITH A FAKE NAME?

17:25.167 --> 17:28.233
WELL, UH,
MY LAST GIRLFRIEND VEENA...

17:28.267 --> 17:30.567
(mouths word)
LEFT ME FOR A GUY
WITH HAIR

17:30.600 --> 17:32.367
SO I GOT PLUGS... TOO LATE.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.400
THIS TIME AROUND, FRANK'S NOT
TAKING ANY CHANCES.

17:34.433 --> 17:36.700
FRANK SEES THE SIGNS
OF DISCONTENT,

17:36.733 --> 17:38.500
FRANK'S FIGHTING BACK.

17:38.533 --> 17:39.700
OH, YEAH.

17:39.733 --> 17:42.433
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST DON'T GET
THE WHOLE FAKE BOOB THING,

17:42.467 --> 17:43.800
NO OFFENSE.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.600
OH, THESE ARE--THESE ARE
TOP OF THE LINE.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.533
I MEAN, THEY--THEY LOOK REAL,
THEY FEEL NATURAL.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.633
NO, REALLY. FEEL 'EM.

17:49.667 --> 17:52.600
REALLY. COME ON.
FEEL THEM.

17:54.567 --> 17:57.167
OOH. VERY SOLID.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.267
AND REAL.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

17:59.300 --> 18:02.233
WELL, COMPARE THEM TO HIS.
I'M NOT INVOLVED
WITH THIS.

18:02.267 --> 18:03.533
COME ON.
DON'T BE SUCH A BABY.

18:03.567 --> 18:05.267
OH.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.800
THIS...

18:10.833 --> 18:13.367
THIS IS WHY
I DON'T WORK WITH INTERNS.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.500
MRS. HANSON.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.067
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

18:20.067 --> 18:22.067
YES, WE WERE ABLE
TO STOP THE BLEEDING.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.733
DR. SHEPHERD HAS ORDERED
AN M.R.I. OF HER SKULL FRACTURE.

18:24.767 --> 18:27.467
HOPEFULLY SHE WON'T NEED
ANY MORE SURGERY.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.100
OH, THANK GOD.
UH, SHE'S IN RECOVERY.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.067
DR. GREY WILL TAKE YOU
UP TO HER.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.533
THANK YOU. UH,
CAN WE WAIT JUST A MINUTE?

18:32.567 --> 18:34.767
MY HUSBAND WENT DOWNSTAIRS
TO USE A LANDLINE.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.700
HIS BATTERY DIED.
SURE.

18:36.733 --> 18:38.333
SO MIA--SHE'S OKAY?

18:38.367 --> 18:41.300
OH, SHE IS. YEAH.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.533
SHE, UM...

18:42.567 --> 18:44.467
KEEPS ASKING,

18:44.500 --> 18:46.400
UH, FOR ANNA.

18:46.433 --> 18:48.667
WE FIRED ANNA.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.100
OH.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.133
SHE JUST SEEMS
VERY ATTACHED TO HER.

18:52.167 --> 18:53.833
THAT'S MY FAULT,

18:53.867 --> 18:56.800
ACCORDING TO MY HUSBAND,
BECAUSE I'M A WORKING MOTHER.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.333
HE'S A WORKING DAD,

18:58.367 --> 19:00.433
BUT APPARENTLY
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

19:00.467 --> 19:02.533
I LOVE MY JOB.
I LOVE MIA MORE.

19:02.567 --> 19:05.733
SHE IS MY BABY.
SHE'S MY...

19:07.767 --> 19:09.167
I LOVE MY DAUGHTER

19:09.200 --> 19:10.400
AND I LOVE MY JOB.

19:10.433 --> 19:12.633
I'M NOT GOOD
AT THE MOM STUFF,

19:12.667 --> 19:15.233
BUT I'M GOOD AT MY JOB.

19:15.267 --> 19:17.400
***

19:17.433 --> 19:19.333
I MEAN,
WHY BOTHER HAVING A KID

19:19.367 --> 19:21.667
IF YOU'RE ONLY GONNA SEE IT
ON WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS?

19:21.700 --> 19:25.267
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST GET A CAT.
I TALKED TO BURKE.
I THINK HE'S FINE.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.367
YOU DID WHAT?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BURKE?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.267
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH ANYBODY.
DO YOU KNOW

19:29.300 --> 19:31.833
HE LET HER DECANNULATE
A HEART THIS MORNING?

19:31.867 --> 19:34.333
YOU DECANNULATED A HEART
THIS MORNING, BY YOURSELF?

19:34.367 --> 19:36.333
BITCH.
NO, NOT BY MYSELF.

19:36.367 --> 19:39.233
NOW SHE'S LYING ABOUT IT.
YANG DECANNULATED
A HEART.

19:39.267 --> 19:40.567
WHY IS ALEX NOT SURPRISED?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.133
IZZIE ISN'T EITHER.

19:42.167 --> 19:44.067
LAST WEEK, IZZIE WAS DIGGING
THROUGH CRAP.

19:44.067 --> 19:46.233
THIS WEEK,
SHE'S FONDLING MAN-BOOBS.

19:46.267 --> 19:47.733
NO DECANNULATING HEARTS
FOR IZZIE.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.700
WHY AREN'T YOU BRAGGING ABOUT
DECANNULATING A HEART?

19:49.733 --> 19:51.367
I DIDN'T DECANNULATE
THE HEART.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.600
IZZIE AND ALEX
DO NOT BELIEVE YOU.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.567
OKAY,
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

19:54.600 --> 19:56.267
(laughs) IZZIE AND ALEX
HAVE A PATIENT

19:56.300 --> 19:59.300
WHO SPEAKS ABOUT HIMSELF
IN THE THIRD PERSON.
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS
ANNOYING AT FIRST,

19:59.333 --> 20:01.633
BUT NOW THEY KIND OF LIKE IT.
GOOD. IS IT GONNA STOP SOON?

20:01.667 --> 20:03.200
WOW, WHAT HAPPENED?

20:03.233 --> 20:05.133
THIS MORNING YOU WERE ALL
"BRIGHT AND SHINY"

20:05.167 --> 20:07.100
AND ASKING TO BE KICKED
IN THE FACE.

20:07.133 --> 20:10.500
I AM. I'M BRIGHT.
I'M SHINY.
YEAH.

20:10.533 --> 20:12.733
IZZIE THINKS THIS WHOLE
BRIGHT AND SHINY THING

20:12.767 --> 20:14.233
IS GETTING OLD.

20:14.267 --> 20:16.500
ALEX AGREES.

20:16.533 --> 20:17.833
WE THINK YOU'RE DEPRESSED.

20:17.867 --> 20:19.267
BOTH OF YOU?

20:19.300 --> 20:21.233
YES.
YES.

20:21.267 --> 20:23.167
WELL, FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO AGREE ON SOMETHING,

20:23.200 --> 20:25.267
I MUST DAMN NEAR BE SUICIDAL.
WE AGREE ON THINGS.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.567
WE AGREE ON THIS.
SO... START TALKING.

20:31.833 --> 20:33.833
ADELE AND I...

20:33.867 --> 20:37.700
SHE WANTS ME TO STEP DOWN
AS CHIEF, RETIRE.

20:37.733 --> 20:39.633
YOU, RETIRE? THAT'S CRAZY.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

20:39.667 --> 20:43.433
UH, SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME
WITH HIS WIFE, PERHAPS?
SHE'S BEING UNREASONABLE.

20:43.467 --> 20:46.433
SHE WANTS TO KNOW THAT HIS
MARRIAGE IS A PRIORITY TO HIM.
SHE'S USING HIS WORK
AS AN EXCUSE.

20:46.467 --> 20:48.333
OR HE IS. SOME MEN USE WORK.
SOME MEN USE OTHER WOMEN.

20:48.367 --> 20:50.667
SOME WOMEN USE OTHER MEN.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.233
I'VE BEEN VISITING ELLIS GREY.
I WAS LONELY,

20:52.267 --> 20:54.700
AND YOU HAD CHECKED OUT
AND I WAS LONELY.

20:54.733 --> 20:57.400
I WORK, I VISIT ELLIS.
THAT'S MY DAY.
YOU GAVE UP ON US FIRST.
I WAS THERE.

20:57.433 --> 20:59.767
I MAKE TIME FOR ELLIS.
I DON'T MAKE TIME FOR ADELE.
THERE'S SOMETHING

20:59.800 --> 21:02.100
DRIVING A WEDGE
BETWEEN RICHARD AND ADELE.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.500
NOW MAYBE YOU DON'T SEE IT,
BUT I DO, AND SO DOES ADELE.

21:04.533 --> 21:06.433
MAYBE HE SEES IT AND DOESN'T
WANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
HE'S GOTTA DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.

21:06.467 --> 21:08.200
THAT'S WHAT MARRIAGE
IS BUILT ON, CHANGE.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.367
CHANGE IS WHAT KEEPS
MARRIAGE ALIVE.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.733
THE MAN HAS A RIGHT TO DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO--
STOP... HELPING ME.

21:13.767 --> 21:16.667
LOOK, I MISS MY WIFE.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.067
I WANT HER BACK.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.400
I DON'T WANT MY MARRIAGE
TO BE OVER.

21:21.433 --> 21:22.800
RICHARD...

21:22.833 --> 21:26.333
YOUR MARRIAGE ISN'T OVER
UNTIL YOU DECIDE IT IS...
RIGHT.

21:26.367 --> 21:28.600
UNTIL YOU DECIDE THAT THE--

21:28.633 --> 21:32.300
WELL, THAT THE SACRIFICE
JUST ISN'T WORTH IT.
RIGHT.

21:33.433 --> 21:35.267
(knock on door)
COME IN.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.400
OH, YANG. WHAT IS IT?

21:41.467 --> 21:43.133
O'MALLEY.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.067
YEAH.

21:45.067 --> 21:48.400
I HAVE YOUR FATHER'S
TEST RESULTS.

21:48.433 --> 21:52.500
***

21:54.233 --> 21:56.467
YOU GOTTA ASK FOR IT.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.400
HEY, WE'VE BEEN WAITING HERE
FOREVER. WHERE'S THE DOCTOR?

21:59.433 --> 22:01.267
UH, DR. WEBBER WILL BE IN
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

22:01.300 --> 22:04.233
WON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING, HUH,
NOT TILL YOU'RE A REAL DOCTOR?

22:04.267 --> 22:06.833
I AM A REAL DOCTOR.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.067
RONNY!

22:09.067 --> 22:11.533
I JUST--
I'M JUST NOT DAD'S DOCTOR.

22:11.567 --> 22:14.500
***

22:14.533 --> 22:16.500
WHAT IS IT, GEORGIE?

22:16.533 --> 22:18.267
LET'S JUST WAIT
FOR DR. WEBBER.

22:18.300 --> 22:21.167
***

22:21.200 --> 22:23.400
(lowers voice) NO, I THINK
HE'S EXPECTING YOU TO TELL HIM.

22:23.433 --> 22:25.300
(George) BUT HE'S COMING.
HE SAID HE'S COMING.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.233
HE'S COMING IN LATER.
YOU SHOULD--

22:27.267 --> 22:29.467
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD
TELL YOUR DAD--
WHAT'S WITH THE WHISPERING?

22:29.500 --> 22:33.067
***

22:36.767 --> 22:40.267
THE BIOPSY RESULTS
WERE ABNORMAL.

22:43.100 --> 22:46.767
(sighs) WELL,
IS ABNORMAL BAD OR...

22:46.800 --> 22:50.633
JUST DIFFERENT?

22:50.667 --> 22:53.067
GEORGIE?

22:53.100 --> 22:56.100
***

23:06.100 --> 23:07.333
SIR...

23:07.367 --> 23:10.267
YOU HAVE CANCER
IN YOUR ESOPHAGUS,

23:10.300 --> 23:12.100
WHICH HAS SPREAD
TO YOUR STOMACH.

23:12.133 --> 23:14.067
WE NEED TO OPERATE
TO REMOVE IT,

23:14.067 --> 23:17.400
AND YOU'LL NEED TO UNDERGO
CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION.

23:17.433 --> 23:19.067
I'M SORRY.

23:19.067 --> 23:22.067
***

23:40.800 --> 23:42.833
THEY'RE GONNA TRY
TO OPERATE SOON.

23:42.867 --> 23:44.733
THIS WEEK, I THINK.

23:44.767 --> 23:48.167
IT'S A STAGE III
METASTATIC CANCER.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.100
SO...

23:50.133 --> 23:54.733
AND MY--MY BROTHERS...
ARE...

23:54.767 --> 23:57.233
AND, UH...

23:57.267 --> 24:00.067
C-CALLIE SLEPT WITH SLOAN.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.367
I JUST CAN'T...

24:02.400 --> 24:05.300
I... I CAN'T...

24:05.333 --> 24:09.200
I CAN'T DEAL WITH--
WITH ANY OF IT.

24:09.233 --> 24:11.133
I SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY
WORRYING ABOUT BURKE,

24:11.167 --> 24:13.067
LIKE THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.

24:13.100 --> 24:15.600
BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH BURKE AND...

24:16.700 --> 24:18.500
GOD, MY DAD HAS CANCER,

24:18.533 --> 24:20.433
I CAN'T EVEN LOOK HIM
IN THE FACE.

24:20.467 --> 24:22.600
CRISTINA HAD TO TELL HIM

24:22.633 --> 24:26.133
WH-WHAT WAS WRONG.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.367
CRISTINA.

24:31.367 --> 24:35.067
NOBODY GETS IT RIGHT
WITH THEIR OWN FAMILY.

24:35.067 --> 24:36.800
I CERTAINLY DON'T.

24:36.833 --> 24:37.767
YEAH.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.400
(Meredith) YEAH.

24:40.433 --> 24:43.300
CALLIE SLEPT WITH SLOAN?

24:43.333 --> 24:46.467
I DON'T GET YOU PEOPLE.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.100
US WITH THE BOOBS?

24:48.133 --> 24:49.433
MM.

24:49.467 --> 24:51.333
WE MAKE
A LOT OF BAD DECISIONS.

24:51.367 --> 24:52.767
YEAH.

24:56.233 --> 24:59.767
DUDE, I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WENT THROUGH ALL THIS

24:59.800 --> 25:01.133
FOR A CHICK.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.800
WHAT, YOU NEVER DID
ANYTHING CRAZY FOR LOVE?

25:03.833 --> 25:05.333
NOT LIKE THIS.

25:05.367 --> 25:07.267
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
NO.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.200
(groans) DR. STEVENS?

25:09.233 --> 25:10.667
FRANK CAN SENSE THE VIBES.

25:10.700 --> 25:12.600
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS
WITH YOU.

25:12.633 --> 25:15.067
WHAT, SHE LEFT YOU
FOR ANOTHER GUY?

25:15.100 --> 25:16.433
OOH.

25:16.467 --> 25:18.200
FRANK'S HIT A NERVE.

25:18.233 --> 25:20.133
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.

25:20.167 --> 25:22.067
UNCOMPLICATE IT THEN, MAN.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.200
AAH.

25:23.233 --> 25:25.500
GRAND GESTURES IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

25:25.533 --> 25:26.600
BE LIKE FRANK.

25:26.633 --> 25:28.567
JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE WANTS
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.433
JUST FORGET ALL ABOUT
THE OTHER GUY.

25:30.467 --> 25:33.200
TRUST FRANK. FRANK KNOWS.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.267
(sighs) HEY,
WHAT DO WE GOT?

25:37.300 --> 25:41.267
THE SECOND M.R.I. REPORT
SHOWS BLEEDING IN MIA'S BRAIN.

25:41.300 --> 25:43.333
OH, DAMN IT.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.667
I NEED TO GO IN,
TRY TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.167
TWO SURGERIES IN ONE DAY?

25:48.200 --> 25:49.700
BUT SHE'S TOUGH.

25:49.733 --> 25:52.733
AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS. HERE.

25:52.767 --> 25:56.267
NOT SO BRIGHT AND SHINY.

25:56.300 --> 25:59.300
(heartbeat playing over monitor)

26:03.467 --> 26:05.233
I THOUGHT THE CANCER
WAS IN MY GUT.

26:05.267 --> 26:07.167
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING
AT MY HEART FOR?

26:07.200 --> 26:08.633
YOUR E.K.G. SHOWED
SOME ABNORMALITIES,

26:08.667 --> 26:11.533
SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOUR HEART'S HEALTHY ENOUGH

26:11.567 --> 26:13.500
TO SUPPORT YOU
THROUGH THE SURGERY.

26:13.533 --> 26:15.300
MM.

26:15.333 --> 26:17.633
(exhales deeply)

26:17.667 --> 26:19.567
YOU'RE A SMART GIRL.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.700
YES.

26:21.733 --> 26:23.400
GEORGE TOLD ME

26:23.433 --> 26:26.067
YOU WERE THE BEST INTERN
I COULD HAVE ON MY CASE.

26:26.067 --> 26:27.800
HE SAID THAT?

26:27.833 --> 26:30.267
HE SAID YOU WERE THE BEST INTERN
IN THE HOSPITAL.

26:30.300 --> 26:33.800
SAID YOU KEEP EVERYONE
ON THEIR TOES,

26:33.833 --> 26:35.200
EVEN HIM. (laughs)

26:35.233 --> 26:36.833
(man) DR. YANG,

26:36.867 --> 26:40.067
YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.767
OKAY.

26:57.633 --> 26:59.600
YOU PAGED ME?

26:59.633 --> 27:01.600
WHAT IS BURKE DOING
IN THERE?

27:01.633 --> 27:04.500
I DID A PRE-OP ECHO.
HIS AORTA VALVE IS LEAKING.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.433
HE WON'T MAKE IT THROUGH
THE CANCER SURGERY

27:06.467 --> 27:08.400
UNLESS WE REPLACE IT.

27:08.433 --> 27:10.633
IT'S JUST
A VALVE REPLACEMENT, GEORGE.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.333
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

27:12.367 --> 27:14.267
BURKE WILL DO IT.

27:15.833 --> 27:18.700
BURKE WILL DO IT, AND YOU
WILL CLEAR HIS SCHEDULE.

27:18.733 --> 27:21.300
IF SOMEONE IS GONNA OPERATE
ON MY DAD'S HEART,

27:21.333 --> 27:23.233
I WANT IT TO BE BURKE.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.133
YEAH.
OKAY.

27:25.167 --> 27:27.467
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
IT'S A VALVE REPLACEMENT.

27:27.500 --> 27:28.500
IT'S PRESTON BURKE.

27:28.533 --> 27:30.600
IF SOMEONE'S GONNA CUT
YOUR DAD'S HEART APART,

27:30.633 --> 27:33.233
YOU WANT IT TO BE HIM.

27:33.267 --> 27:35.533
WHAT?

27:42.200 --> 27:44.100
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BURKE'S HAND?

27:44.133 --> 27:46.100
NOTHING.

27:46.133 --> 27:48.067
HE'S GONNA OPERATE
ON MY FATHER.

27:48.067 --> 27:51.300
GEORGE, BURKE IS FINE.
YOUR DAD WILL BE FINE.
YOU'RE LYING.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.633
BURKE IS HIDING SOMETHING,
AND YOU'RE HELPING HIM.

27:53.667 --> 27:56.667
LEAVE ME ALONE.

28:06.067 --> 28:07.400
(knock on door)

28:07.433 --> 28:10.067
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, CHIEF?

28:10.100 --> 28:11.267
UM...

28:11.300 --> 28:13.300
IT'S ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

28:17.467 --> 28:19.433
UM...

28:19.467 --> 28:23.567
I-I KNOW YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER IS, UH...

28:23.600 --> 28:25.633
COMPLICATED.

28:25.667 --> 28:28.500
AND I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT SHE AND I WERE--

28:28.533 --> 28:30.500
CHIEF, IT'S OKAY.

28:30.533 --> 28:33.400
WHAT REALLY MATTERS
IS THAT YOU MAKE HER HAPPY,

28:33.433 --> 28:35.833
AND MY FATHER COULDN'T

28:35.867 --> 28:37.233
AND I COULDN'T, SO--

28:37.267 --> 28:40.067
MEREDITH, I...

28:40.067 --> 28:42.833
I CAN'T SEE YOUR MOTHER
ANYMORE.

28:42.867 --> 28:46.633
I NEED TO MAKE...

28:46.667 --> 28:50.500
I NEED TO TRY TO MAKE
MY MARRIAGE WORK.

28:50.533 --> 28:54.067
AND IF I'M GONNA DO THAT...

28:54.100 --> 28:57.267
I HAVE TO STOP SEEING
YOUR MOTHER.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.200
I SEE.

28:59.233 --> 29:01.300
SHE...

29:03.533 --> 29:05.800
SHE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN.

29:05.833 --> 29:08.800
SHE WORKED SO HARD,
SHE SACRIFICED SO MUCH,

29:08.833 --> 29:12.800
AND TO SEE IT END LIKE THIS,
IT...

29:17.167 --> 29:19.333
TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER
FOR ME.

29:22.767 --> 29:24.700
(knock on door)

29:24.733 --> 29:27.100
WE GOT IT FROM HERE.
YO.

29:27.133 --> 29:30.100
OKAY, FRANK.
TIME TO TAKE THE TUBE OUT.

29:32.567 --> 29:34.367
IZZIE, PUT ON SOME GLOVES.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.267
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ALEX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:36.300 --> 29:38.233
YOU READY TO TAKE OUT
FRANK'S BOOB TUBE?

29:38.267 --> 29:40.200
WHAT ABOUT THE RULES?
WHAT IF SLOAN FINDS OUT?

29:40.233 --> 29:42.367
SCREW SLOAN.
SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING, RIGHT?

29:42.400 --> 29:45.400
I PROMISE YOU, FRANK, THE TWINS
ARE IN EXCELLENT HANDS.

29:45.433 --> 29:46.667
AHH.

29:46.700 --> 29:49.167
GRAND GESTURE.
FRANK GETS IT.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.100
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?
NOTHING.

29:51.133 --> 29:53.733
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
OH, YEAH, HE'S SURE.

29:53.767 --> 29:56.433
(laughs)

29:56.467 --> 30:00.433
***

30:05.167 --> 30:08.200
(Derek) LOOKS LIKE WE CAN
SAFELY EVACUATE THE CLOT.

30:09.867 --> 30:13.033
***

30:16.700 --> 30:19.467
DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT
HAVING KIDS?

30:19.500 --> 30:22.367
DEREK AND I TALKED ABOUT IT,
BUT I WASN'T READY.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.133
I LOVE KIDS.
I'D HAVE A DOZEN.

30:25.167 --> 30:26.033
BELIEVE ME, ONE'S ENOUGH,

30:26.067 --> 30:29.167
UNLESS YOU PLAN
TO PUT AWAY YOUR SCALPEL.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.333
THAT'S WHY
GOD INVENTED NANNIES.

30:31.367 --> 30:32.300
(chuckles)

30:32.333 --> 30:34.633
I WISH IT WERE THAT EASY.

30:34.667 --> 30:38.033
WHAT DO I DO WITH THESE,
HOCK 'EM, KEEP 'EM?

30:38.067 --> 30:40.133
MY MOM SAYS POST-DIVORCE
WEDDING RINGS ARE BAD JUJU.

30:40.167 --> 30:42.067
YOUR MOM SAYS JUJU?
SHE DOES.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.567
SO WH--

30:43.600 --> 30:46.333
WHAT WOULD YOUR MOM DO?

30:46.367 --> 30:50.533
BURN 'EM, BURY 'EM.

30:50.567 --> 30:52.433
YOU WANT 'EM?

30:52.467 --> 30:55.267
OH--OH, I-I WANT SOME RINGS,
JUST NOT BAD JUJU RINGS.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.500
THEN AGAIN, MY MOM'S
KIND OF INSANE.

30:56.533 --> 30:58.267
HEY, DON'T TALK SMACK
ABOUT YOUR MOM.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.100
(Addison) MIRANDA.

31:00.133 --> 31:02.067
***

31:02.067 --> 31:05.767
YESTERDAY,
I LEFT FOR WORK EARLY,

31:05.800 --> 31:09.433
AND TUCK'S FAVORITE FOOD
WAS STRAINED PEAS.

31:09.467 --> 31:11.367
NASTY GREEN GUNK,
BUT HE LOVED THEM,

31:11.400 --> 31:12.633
ATE THEM FOR BREAKFAST.

31:12.667 --> 31:14.567
I GOT HOME
AFTER A 15-HOUR SHIFT,

31:14.600 --> 31:18.167
AND HE DOESN'T LIKE
STRAINED PEAS ANYMORE.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.700
HE ONLY WANTS CARROTS.

31:20.733 --> 31:23.733
LIFE MOVES SO FAST.

31:23.767 --> 31:25.667
EVERYBODY MOVES ON.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.567
YEP.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.100
(Addison) WHERE YOU GOING?

31:30.133 --> 31:32.067
I'M NOT READY TO MOVE ON.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.700
***

31:42.600 --> 31:46.233
DO YOU KNOW WHY I PICKED YOU
TO BE MY DAD'S INTERN?

31:46.267 --> 31:48.600
BECAUSE YOU ARE A ROBOT.

31:48.633 --> 31:50.533
YOU'RE A FREAKIN' ROBOT
IN A WHITE COAT

31:50.567 --> 31:52.067
WHO NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE,

31:52.067 --> 31:53.833
AND MOST OF THE TIME,
I APPRECIATE THAT.

31:53.867 --> 31:56.067
MOST OF THE TIME,
I REALLY FEEL

31:56.067 --> 31:57.800
LIKE I HAVE SOMETHING
TO LEARN FROM YOU.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.467
BUT RIGHT NOW--

31:59.500 --> 32:02.367
RIGHT NOW, I NEED YOU TO TRY,
JUST FOR A MINUTE,

32:02.400 --> 32:04.433
I NEED YOU TO TRY TO BE
A HUMAN BEING.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.433
THANK YOU, ALEX.

32:22.467 --> 32:24.700
ALEX IS COOL,

32:24.733 --> 32:26.633
ALEX IS THE COOLEST.

OH, ALEX KNOWS IT.

IZZIE ISN'T SO BAD
HERSELF.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.167
NO, IZZIE IS ROCKING.

IZZIE IS BACK IN THE GAME.

32:58.133 --> 33:01.533
I NEED TO HEAR
HOW GREAT YOU TALK.

33:01.567 --> 33:03.467
CAN YOU SAY MY NAME?

33:10.133 --> 33:11.500
THAT WAS GREAT.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.333
GUESS WHO'S HERE.

33:13.367 --> 33:16.267
MOM AND DAD.

33:16.300 --> 33:19.100
HEY.

33:19.133 --> 33:21.400
HOW'S MY BABY GIRL, HUH?

33:21.433 --> 33:22.767

33:33.867 --> 33:36.733
SO WE'LL DO THE THING
WITH THE HEART TOMORROW?

33:36.767 --> 33:38.733
MAYBE TOMORROW.
UH, MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.667
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
QUITE YET.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.600
BUT, UH, DR. WEBBER
AND DR. BURKE SAID

33:42.633 --> 33:44.700
WE SHOULD GET TO IT QUICK.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.133
AND WE WILL GET TO IT
AS QUICK AS WE CAN.

33:47.167 --> 33:49.800
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE DO IT RIGHT.

33:49.833 --> 33:51.733

I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

33:51.767 --> 33:53.367
WHY THEY'RE OPERATING
ON HIS HEART

33:53.400 --> 33:55.600
WHEN THE CANCER
IS IN HIS GUT.

33:55.633 --> 33:58.767
YEAH, IT'S COMPLICATED.
UM...

33:58.800 --> 34:01.233
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING?
MAYBE THE TESTS ARE WRONG.

34:01.267 --> 34:03.200
OKAY? MAYBE IT'S NOT CANCER.

34:03.233 --> 34:05.567
'CAUSE--'CAUSE--'CAUSE CANCER
RUNS IN THE FAMILY, RIGHT?

34:05.600 --> 34:07.600
AND NO ONE ELSE IN THE FAMILY
HAS CANCER.

34:07.633 --> 34:09.133
IT--IT IS CANCER.

34:09.167 --> 34:12.533
OKAY? IT'S STAGE III
METASTATIC ESOPHAGEAL CANCER.

34:12.567 --> 34:14.267
META-WHATIC?

34:14.300 --> 34:18.100
METASTATIC. IT'S, UH,
WHEN THE CANCER CELLS

34:18.133 --> 34:20.200
HAVE MIGRATED FROM
THEIR POINT OF ORIGIN--

34:20.233 --> 34:22.367
OKAY, YOU'RE TALKING
DOCTOR NOW, GEORGE.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.267
JUST TALK ENGLISH.
I AM TALKING ENGLISH,
YOU'RE JUST NOT LISTENING!

34:25.300 --> 34:27.200
NO, YOU'RE JUST NOT SAYING
ANYTHING THAT WE UNDERSTAND!

34:27.233 --> 34:28.667
YEAH.
BOYS.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.133
IMAGINE YOUR DAD'S LIKE A--
LIKE A VINTAGE CAR, OKAY?

34:33.167 --> 34:33.967
CALLIE--

34:34.067 --> 34:36.633
AND, UH, HIS--
HIS BLOOD'S LIKE GAS

34:36.667 --> 34:37.800
FLOWING THROUGH
THE FUEL LINES.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.533
THE CANCER CELLS

34:39.567 --> 34:42.133
ARE LIKE THE GUNK
THAT BUILDS UP IN THERE.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.600
AND FOULS UP--
FOULS UP THE PLUGS.
EXACTLY.

34:43.633 --> 34:46.200
ONCE THE GUNK
STARTS CIRCULATING, IT CAN DO

34:46.233 --> 34:48.733
A LOT OF DAMAGE
TO THE WHOLE ENGINE--

34:48.767 --> 34:50.400
THE CARBURETOR, EVERYTHING.

34:50.433 --> 34:53.067
IT'S--IT'S LIKE THE ENGINE
HAD ALREADY BLOWN A GASKET

34:53.067 --> 34:56.367
EVEN BEFORE
ALL THE OTHER DAMAGE STARTED.

34:59.833 --> 35:02.567

35:06.667 --> 35:09.400
(Anna and Mia)
* GOOD NIGHT, HOT FUDGE

TO SAY GOOD NIGHT *

35:11.367 --> 35:14.067

35:14.100 --> 35:17.633
WHEN IT COMES TO
OUR BLIND SPOTS...

35:17.667 --> 35:22.767
MAYBE OUR BRAINS
AREN'T COMPENSATING.

35:22.800 --> 35:27.367
MAYBE THEY'RE PROTECTING US.

39:21.233 --> 39:24.067
* BUT GOD BLESS THE CHILD

39:24.067 --> 39:26.833
* THAT'S GOT HIS OWN

39:26.867 --> 39:33.267
* THAT'S GOT HIS OWN

39:33.300 --> 39:37.200

40:31.100 --> 40:33.667
* PAPA MAY HAVE

40:33.700 --> 40:36.633
* BUT GOD BLESS THE CHILD

40:36.667 --> 40:39.567

40:39.600 --> 40:43.767
* THAT'S GOT HIS OWN
