WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.306
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.350 --> 00:03.960
OCTAVIA: YOU'’RE STOPPING
HER HEART?

00:05.831 --> 00:07.224
GABRIEL: DEATH CAUSES HER MIND
TO BACK UP ONTO THE DRIVE.
I TAKE IT OUT...

00:07.268 --> 00:08.443
WE GET CLARKE BACK.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.444
GABRIEL: I NEED TO
RESTART HER HEART.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.446
WHY ISN'’T SHE WAKING UP?

00:11.489 --> 00:13.187
GABRIEL: '’CAUSE JOSEPHINE'S
STILL INSIDE.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.318
OCTAVIA: SHE'’S GONE.

00:14.362 --> 00:15.841
NO, SHE'’S NOT!

00:18.844 --> 00:20.411
CLARKE?

00:20.455 --> 00:21.891
NO ONE'’S GONNA FIND OUT
I'’M A NIGHTBLOOD.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.197
QUIET.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.851
RUSSELL: MIRANDA'’S DEAD.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.636
RYKER: THEY'’RE EXECUTING
ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE TONIGHT.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.377
GAIA: MADI?
RYKER: NO. SHE'’S A HOST.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.074
THE CHILD IS SPARED,
BUT THE REST OF YOU

00:31.118 --> 00:32.728
WILL BURN AT THE STAKE
FOR YOUR CRIMES.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.860
ECHO: GET ME TO A WINDOW
WITH A VIEW OF THE EXECUTION.

00:34.904 --> 00:35.861
GOT HIM.

00:35.905 --> 00:38.255
SORRY.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.865
MURPHY: SO LISTEN
TO ME, OK? YOU CAN
STILL SAVE YOUR WIFE.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.302
WE CAN STILL MAKE
NIGHTBLOOD.

00:41.345 --> 00:42.520
BONE MARROW.

00:42.564 --> 00:45.132
TAKE THEM DOWN.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.235
DR. JACKSON?

01:01.278 --> 01:03.454
I'’M HERE, MADI.

01:03.498 --> 01:06.370
I CAN'’T FEEL MY HAND.
SOMETHING'’S WRONG.

01:07.806 --> 01:10.505
PLEASE HELP. I CAN'’T
FEEL IT.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.246
I CAN'’T BREATHE.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.597
MADI, IT'’S OK.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.078
UH!

01:23.213 --> 01:25.259
UNH!

01:25.302 --> 01:28.088
JACKSON: ABBY! RAVEN! EMORI!

01:28.131 --> 01:31.134
SHEIDHEDA:
WHY DIDN'’T YOU LET ME
GO FOR THE THROAT,

01:31.178 --> 01:32.701
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT?

01:34.659 --> 01:37.227
I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED REVENGE.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.930
YOUR MOVE.

01:44.974 --> 01:47.194
BECAUSE JACKSON IS
INNOCENT. HE'’S ONE OF US.

01:47.237 --> 01:48.543
ONE OF YOU?

01:48.586 --> 01:52.199
HE'’S DRAINING YOUR
MARROW AS WE SPEAK.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.464
LET'’S JUST PLAY THE GAME.

01:56.507 --> 02:00.163
CHESS ISN'’T A GAME.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.773
A LESSON IN STRATEGY,

02:01.817 --> 02:03.906
AND YOU'’RE NOT
PAYING ATTENTION.

02:09.564 --> 02:12.306
CHECKMATE.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.960
JACKSON IS A PAWN.

02:15.004 --> 02:18.181
IF YOU HAD KILLED HIM,
WE'’D BE FREE RIGHT NOW

02:18.225 --> 02:20.357
AND ON OUR WAY
TO THE PALACE
TO KILL THE PEOPLE

02:20.401 --> 02:21.967
WHO HAD MURDERED CLARKE.

02:22.011 --> 02:25.319
INSTEAD WE'’LL NOW
LIKELY DIE WITH HER,

02:25.362 --> 02:28.278
SO WELL DONE.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.324
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?!

02:41.335 --> 02:45.034
I WANT YOU TO RULE
THIS WORLD

02:45.077 --> 02:47.776
AS I DID THE LAST.

02:47.819 --> 02:50.213
I WANT YOU TO KILL EVERYONE

02:50.257 --> 02:52.346
WHO GETS IN YOUR WAY.

02:52.389 --> 02:55.566
I WANT YOU TO GET
REVENGE FOR CLARKE.

03:01.703 --> 03:05.097
TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

04:00.501 --> 04:03.286
HEY.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.462
YOU'’RE OK.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.290
I'’M STILL HERE.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.379
THANKS TO YOU.

04:09.423 --> 04:12.164
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP?

04:12.208 --> 04:14.036
A FEW HOURS.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.521
I'’M SO SORRY, CLARKE.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.872
I KNEW YOU WERE
A TARGET.

04:23.915 --> 04:26.396
I DIDN'’T PROTECT YOU.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.446
BELLAMY, YOU SAVED ME.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.452
SO HOW DO WE SAVE
EVERYONE

04:38.495 --> 04:40.541
THAT I LEFT BEHIND?

04:40.584 --> 04:44.196
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DIDN'’T,
I'’D BE DEAD.

04:45.546 --> 04:48.244
THEY ALL WOULD--
ECHO, MADI.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.464
JOSEPHINE WOULD'’VE
MADE SURE OF IT.

04:50.507 --> 04:51.900
YOUR PLAN WAS GOOD.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.511
MY PLAN WAS TO USE
JOSEPHINE'’S MIND DRIVE

04:54.555 --> 04:56.034
TO BARGAIN FOR PEACE,

04:56.078 --> 04:59.037
AND NOW THERE'’S NO MIND
ON THE DRIVE.

04:59.081 --> 05:03.172
CLARKE: WE DON'’T NEED
THE MIND DRIVE.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.608
WE'’VE GOT ME.

05:04.652 --> 05:07.219
NO, NO WAY.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.744
BELLAMY, IF WE DON'’T GIVE
RUSSELL HIS DAUGHTER BACK--

05:09.787 --> 05:11.659
CLARKE, AS SOON AS HE
REALIZES YOU'’RE NOT HER,

05:11.702 --> 05:13.574
WHICH WILL BE THE SECOND
YOU WALK IN THE DOOR

05:13.617 --> 05:15.140
AND HE CHECKS THE DRIVE,

05:15.184 --> 05:16.794
YOU'’RE DEAD.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.536
GABRIEL: SO LET'’S
PUT IT BACK IN.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.452
THAT'’S NOT
HAPPENING.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.193
WE APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU DID FOR US,

05:24.236 --> 05:26.587
BUT THESE ARE OUR PEOPLE.
WE'’LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.589
THIS ISN'’T JUST
ABOUT OUR PEOPLE, BELLAMY.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.330
WELL, IT IS
FOR ME, CLARKE.

05:34.986 --> 05:38.729
GOOD. EVERYBODY'’S AWAKE.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.949
SO WHAT'’S THE PLAN?

05:51.394 --> 05:54.528
LET'’S PLAY WHAT'S A BIGGER
WASTE OF TIME, SHALL WE?

05:54.571 --> 05:57.357
TRYING TO PRY OFF A LOCK
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS

05:57.400 --> 06:00.534
OR PRAYING FOR
A 12-YEAR-OLD PSYCHOPATH

06:00.577 --> 06:02.579
TO COME TO OUR RESCUE.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.407
SHE'’S NOT A PSYCHOPATH.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.583
SHE'’S A CHILD UNDER
ASSAULT FROM A DEMON.

06:06.627 --> 06:10.195
AND THE LONGER
WE WAIT...

06:10.239 --> 06:12.372
THE MORE CONTROL HE
HAS OVER HER.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.417
JUST RELAX.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.201
RAVEN'’S ON THE CASE.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.899
I'’M SURE MADI WILL
BE FINE

06:17.942 --> 06:19.901
AS SOON AS HOUDINI
MILLER BREAKS US
OUT OF HERE

06:19.944 --> 06:22.077
AND WE GET BECCA'’S
BOOK OF SPELLS.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.514
THAT'’S FROM THE
MACHINE SHOP, RIGHT?

06:24.558 --> 06:28.692
AH!
IT'’S NO USE,

06:28.736 --> 06:30.738
NOT WITHOUT SOMETHING
TO PICK IT.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.001
WOW. WHAT A SURPRISE.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.785
YOU GOT A BETTER
IDEA, MURPHY?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.874
NAH. HELP ME GET THIS
OUT OF THE WAY.

06:36.918 --> 06:40.008
ANYONE WANT TO TAKE A GUESS
AS TO WHAT HAPPENED TO ECHO?

06:40.051 --> 06:43.228
GAIA: SHE WOULD'’VE
SAVED US IF SHE COULD.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.666
MILLER: WE HAVE TO ASSUME
THEY HAVE HER, TOO, NOW.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.798
MAKING THEM NIGHTBLOOD
BOUGHT US SOME TIME,

06:47.842 --> 06:49.931
BUT DOES ANYONE
REALLY BELIEVE

06:49.974 --> 06:52.977
THEY'’RE JUST GONNA LET
US WALK ONCE IT'’S DONE?

06:53.021 --> 06:54.588
MAN: OPEN IT UP. LET'’S GO.

07:00.681 --> 07:02.639
ON YOUR FEET, MURPHY.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.467
YOU'’RE WANTED IN
THE PALACE.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.905
RUSSELL: YOU'’RE
GUILTY OF ATTEMPTING
TO ASSASSINATE A PRIME

07:07.949 --> 07:10.908
AND SPREADING
BLASPHEMOUS RUMORS.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.693
THE PUNISHMENT
FOR THIS IS DEATH,

07:12.736 --> 07:14.434
BUT WE CAN BE MERCIFUL.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.044
YOUR FRIEND JORDAN SAVED
THE LIFE OF PRIA VII.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.611
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.482
ALL BUT ECHO: HALLOWED
BE HER NAME.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.571
RUSSELL: SHE'’S SEEN TO HIS
ONGOING RECOVERY PERSONALLY.

07:21.615 --> 07:25.445
BECAUSE YOUR CRIMES
WERE COMMITTED
TO SAVE YOUR PEOPLE,

07:25.488 --> 07:27.708
I WILL OFFER YOU A CHANCE
FOR MERCY AS WELL.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.623
BUT YOU HAVE TO EARN IT,

07:29.666 --> 07:31.494
STARTING BY TELLING US
WHO ELSE YOU TALKED TO

07:31.538 --> 07:33.627
OTHER THAN TAI.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.283
NO ONE. IT WAS JUST HIM.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.677
TOO BAD YOU CAN'’T ASK HIM
WHO HE TOLD.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.505
THE MAN MURDERED
A PRIME.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.724
MAYBE YOU
SHOULD TAKE THIS

07:43.767 --> 07:45.639
A LITTLE MORE
SERIOUSLY.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.075
THAT WASN'’T MURDER.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.643
SIMONE PRIME,
HALLOWED BE HER NAME,

07:49.686 --> 07:51.645
WILL BE BACK.

07:51.688 --> 07:55.170
THE LIFE TAKEN TO MAKE
THAT HAPPEN WILL BE MURDER.

08:02.351 --> 08:05.702
THE LIFE TAKEN TO MAKE
THAT HAPPEN

08:05.746 --> 08:07.312
WILL BE YOURS.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.143
TAKE HER
TO THE MACHINE SHOP.

08:12.187 --> 08:13.710
TEST ABBY'’S
BONE MARROW FORMULA.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.757
IF IT WORKS AND TURNS
YOU INTO A HOST,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.149
THEN IT WILL BE YOUR
GREAT HONOR

08:18.193 --> 08:19.977
TO BECOME ONE WITH
SIMONE PRIME.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.023
HALLOWED BE
HER NAME.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.807
ALL BUT ECHO AND MURPHY:
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.636
I'’VE NEVER PERFORMED
THAT PROCEDURE BEFORE.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.246
YOU KNOW THAT.

08:28.290 --> 08:32.424
RUSSELL: AND I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO, BUT I'’M ASKING YOU NOW.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.732
YOU'’RE TRAINED FOR THIS.
WE ALL ARE.

08:35.776 --> 08:38.605
AND WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD
OUR MORAL EQUIVOCATIONS,

08:38.648 --> 08:42.173
BUT THIS IS HOW WE GET
OUR FAMILY BACK.

08:44.567 --> 08:48.136
GOOD. CALL FOR ME
WHEN IT'’S DONE.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.530
I WANT TO BE THERE
FOR THE RESURRECTION.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.536
SHE COMES
WITH ME.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.196
SILENCE.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.507
MURPHY, YOU TRAITOR!
I'’LL KILL YOU!

09:11.551 --> 09:13.117
YOU'’VE ALWAYS BEEN
A TRAITOR.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.684
YOU'’VE ALWAYS BEEN
A FILTHY--

09:15.990 --> 09:19.820
SO WHO
DO I GET TO BE?

09:19.863 --> 09:22.518
YOU'’RE A SLIPPERY ONE, JOHN,

09:22.562 --> 09:24.694
ALWAYS PLAYING
BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.740
I DOUBT YOU'’VE EVER
DONE ANYTHING

09:26.783 --> 09:28.611
THAT DIDN'’T REDOUND TO
YOUR OWN BENEFIT.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.613
COME ON. NOW,
THAT'’S JUST MEAN.

09:30.657 --> 09:33.616
DON'’T GET ME WRONG.
I LIKE THAT ABOUT YOU.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.183
OH, YOU DO, HUH?

09:35.226 --> 09:36.967
IT MEANS I CAN TRUST YOU
AS LONG AS WHAT I'’M ASKING

09:37.011 --> 09:38.969
HAS SOMETHING IN IT FOR YOU.

09:39.013 --> 09:41.189
AND WHAT ARE YOU
ASKING?

09:41.232 --> 09:42.973
ACCORDING TO JADE,
MY DAUGHTER IS STILL ALIVE,

09:43.017 --> 09:44.845
OR WAS LAST NIGHT.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.194
I NEED YOU TO BRING
HER HOME.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.413
IF YOU CAN DO THIS,
THEN YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND

09:48.457 --> 09:50.546
HAVE YOUR IMMORTALITY
AFTER ALL.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.330
-AND IF I SAY NO?
-YOU WON'’T.

09:53.810 --> 09:56.987
IF YOU FAIL, HOWEVER,

09:57.031 --> 09:58.641
OR DO SOMETHING
THAT KEEPS MY DAUGHTER

09:58.685 --> 10:00.774
FROM HER PLACE AT MY SIDE,

10:00.817 --> 10:04.734
THEN I WILL BE FORCED
TO TAKE AN EYE FOR AN EYE.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.781
IMMORTALITY
OR MORTALITY.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.827
IT SEEMS FAIR.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.656
NOT YOUR EYE, JOHN.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.833
EMORI'’S.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.922
YOU HAVE TILL SECOND MOON.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.630
YOU'’RE A NIGHTBLOOD.
YOU COULD WALK
THROUGH THE SHIELD

10:30.673 --> 10:32.632
AT ANY TIME AND LOWER IT.
WHY HAVEN'’T YOU?

10:32.675 --> 10:34.982
OLIVIA: BECAUSE HE
DOESN'’T WANT TO KILL
THE PEOPLE INSIDE.

10:35.025 --> 10:37.854
HE WANTS TO SAVE THEM,
AND THEY'’LL DIE
TO PROTECT THE PRIMES.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.422
THEN THEY DIE.
I'’M NOT LETTING OUR
PEOPLE GET EXECUTED

10:40.465 --> 10:42.467
BECAUSE THEIRS
ARE DELUSIONAL.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.078
GABRIEL: I DON'’T HAVE
THE CODE.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.340
I COULDN'’T LOWER
THE SHIELD IF I TRIED.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.646
BELLAMY: WHAT ABOUT RYKER?

10:46.689 --> 10:48.735
HE BUILT IT, AND HE
HELPED YOU ESCAPE.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.562
GO TO HIM,
YOU LOWER THE SHIELD,

10:50.606 --> 10:51.694
WE DO THE REST.

10:51.738 --> 10:52.956
GABRIEL:
RYKER WON'’T HELP US.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.436
HE LEFT
MY CELL DOOR OPEN

10:54.479 --> 10:55.742
TO STOP SIMONE FROM
BURNING ME AT THE STAKE,

10:55.785 --> 10:58.179
BUT HE WOULDN'’T HELP ME
STOP THE RESURRECTIONS.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.268
OCTAVIA: THEY WERE
GONNA BURN YOU?

11:00.311 --> 11:02.313
THAT'’S WHAT YOU DO
TO DEMONS.

11:02.357 --> 11:05.316
I DESTROYED
THE EMBRYOS.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.796
WE LANDED
WITH A THOUSAND.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.277
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED
WITH WHAT YOU CALL
NIGHTBLOOD

11:09.320 --> 11:10.757
TO PROTECT AGAINST
SOLAR RADIATION.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.497
CLARKE: THAT'’S WHY
HOSTS ARE SO RARE--

11:12.541 --> 11:14.021
WHY JOSEPHINE
STARTED OBLATION.

11:14.064 --> 11:17.154
GABRIEL: I DIDN'’T
THINK SHE WOULD TAKE
IT THAT FAR, BUT--

11:17.198 --> 11:19.374
SO YOUR NONVIOLENT
REVOLUTION MADE THINGS WORSE.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.246
OCTAVIA: BELLAMY, HE DOESN'’T
WANT TO KILL HIS OWN PEOPLE.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.465
-WHY NOT? YOU DID.
-BELLAMY.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.032
BELLAMY: I DON'’T NEED
A LECTURE

11:25.075 --> 11:28.557
ON MORAL RELATIVITY FROM
THE QUEEN OF CANNIBALS.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.649
CAN I TALK TO YOU
OUTSIDE?

11:33.693 --> 11:36.521
NO. NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
FOR ONCE, O.,

11:36.565 --> 11:38.785
YOU'’RE NOT
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.048
PLEASE?

11:47.576 --> 11:50.100
CLARKE: GO.
WE'’LL KEEP THINKING.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.452
YOUR SISTER'’S
SPECIAL.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.237
WELL, THAT'’S
ONE WORD FOR IT.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.021
I'’M SERIOUS, BELLAMY.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.893
SHE WENT INTO THE ANOMALY
AND CAME BACK.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.982
NO ONE'’S
EVER DONE THAT BEFORE.

12:02.025 --> 12:02.983
CLARKE: THE ANOMALY?

12:04.419 --> 12:06.464
GABRIEL:
THAT SOUND YOU HEAR,

12:06.508 --> 12:08.379
THE GREAT MYSTERY
OF SANCTUM.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.946
LOOK, SHE DIDN'’T
REMEMBER ANYTHING,

12:09.990 --> 12:12.470
SO I GAVE HER RED SUN
TOXIN TO HELP HER SEE.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.342
SHE CHOSE TO LOOK
INWARD INSTEAD.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.647
CLARKE: BUT THERE
WAS NO ECLIPSE.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.519
GABRIEL:
THE TOXIN'’S EVERYWHERE--

12:17.562 --> 12:19.564
IN EVERY LEAF,
IN EVERY TREE, THE SOIL,

12:19.608 --> 12:21.001
THE ROCKS.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.394
OVER TIME,
WE FOUND OTHER WAYS
TO HARNESS ITS POWER.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.703
YOU WEAPONIZED IT,
DIDN'’T YOU?

12:27.747 --> 12:28.748
SIMONE DID

12:28.791 --> 12:30.750
AS PART OF HER
ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.577
MY RESEARCH WAS FOCUSED
ON AN ANTITOXIN.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.754
THE DISCOVERY THAT
INTRAVENOUS USE PRODUCED

12:34.797 --> 12:37.931
A WAKING DREAM WAS
A HAPPY ACCIDENT.

12:37.974 --> 12:41.935
OCTAVIA: UH, GABRIEL,
YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.

12:46.983 --> 12:49.812
OCTAVIA: DON'’T SHOOT.
WE'’RE ON THE SAME SIDE.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.772
BELLAMY, GUN DOWN.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.774
SAME SIDE, HUH?

12:54.817 --> 12:56.776
HE WAS WITH JOSEPHINE
IN THE CAVE.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.386
-HEY, HEY.
-IT'’S HER--JOSEPHINE PRIME.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.822
BELLAMY: NO, NO, NO.
MAN: RAISE YOUR WEAPONS.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.737
MAN: TAKE HER DOWN!
BELLAMY: IT'’S NOT HER.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.652
GABRIEL, WE COULD USE
A LITTLE HELP.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.875
XAVIER?

13:12.139 --> 13:15.316
WOMAN: XAVIER, BROTHER,
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

13:15.359 --> 13:16.970
LAYLA, IT'’S OK.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.145
NELSON, PUT THE WEAPON DOWN.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.103
ALL OF YOU, WEAPONS DOWN.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.149
THAT'’S AN ORDER.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.890
YOU DON'’T GIVE
ORDERS.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.414
WHERE'’S THE OLD MAN?

13:26.457 --> 13:29.199
LAYLA, SEARCH
THE TENT.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.073
THE OLD MAN IS DEAD.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.424
SO IS XAVIER.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.216
ON YOUR KNEES.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.842
GABRIEL.

14:09.022 --> 14:09.936
TRAITOR! AAH!

14:09.979 --> 14:12.025
GET BACK! COME ON.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.070
NELSON: LAYLA, EASY!

14:14.114 --> 14:15.071
EASY.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.475
NELSON: EXPLAIN.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.868
I DIDN'’T WANT THIS.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.218
I LOVED XAVIER LIKE
A SON. YOU KNOW THAT.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.089
DON'’T SAY HIS NAME.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.700
NELSON: LAYLA, IF YOU
CAN'’T HANDLE THIS, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD WAIT OUTSIDE.

14:35.744 --> 14:38.878
I'’M FINE. I NEED
TO HEAR THIS.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.880
GABRIEL: EDUARDO BROUGHT ME
BACK WITHOUT MY CONSENT.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.012
NELSON: EDUARDO'’S BEEN
DEAD FOR 10 YEARS,

14:43.056 --> 14:46.059
KILLED BY SANCTUM GUARDS
AROUND THE TIME
THE OLD MAN DISAPPEARED.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.061
IT WASN'’T
THE SANCTUM GUARDS.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.413
TEN YEARS?

14:52.456 --> 14:56.243
HE'’S BEEN LYING TO
US FOR 10 YEARS,

14:56.286 --> 14:58.854
LETTING ME CALL HIM
BROTHER?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.638
NELSON:
HE'’S STILL OUR LEADER.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.162
NO.

15:02.205 --> 15:05.730
HE'’S A TRAITOR
AND A PRIME.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.081
HE COULD'’VE TOLD
US THE TRUTH,

15:08.124 --> 15:12.955
BUT INSTEAD, HE
LET US THINK WE
WERE ABANDONED.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.566
NOW, GIVE ME
BACK THE GUN

15:15.610 --> 15:19.744
AND LET ME END THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.316
BELLAMY: WAIT.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.319
IF THIS IS WHAT YOU
REALLY WANT,

15:29.363 --> 15:32.105
AT LEAST WAIT UNTIL HE
DELIVERS THE BOMB.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.758
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.021
SHUT UP.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.544
I'’M TALKING ABOUT
WEAPONIZED RED SUN TOXIN.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.111
GABRIEL'’S A NIGHTBLOOD.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.417
HE CAN WALK IT RIGHT THROUGH
THE SHIELD AND DEPLOY IT.

15:40.461 --> 15:43.029
ONCE IT'’S IN THE AIR,
HE FINDS OUR FRIEND RAVEN.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.335
SHE'’LL BRING THE SHIELD DOWN
FOR THE REST OF US.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.424
WE USE THE CHAOS
OF THE EVACUATION

15:47.468 --> 15:49.122
TO RESCUE OUR PEOPLE.

15:49.165 --> 15:52.212
YOU KILL THE PRIMES.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.083
THAT'’S HOW THIS ENDS.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.824
IT'’S A GOOD PLAN.

15:55.867 --> 15:59.001
LAYLA: COME ON. YOU
TRUST THEM JUST LIKE THAT?

15:59.045 --> 16:01.961
NO. BUT I WILL...

16:04.398 --> 16:08.184
WHEN HE KILLS
JOSEPHINE PRIME.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.794
I'’M NOT
JOSEPHINE.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.796
GABRIEL: IT'’S TRUE.
JOSEPHINE'’S GONE.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.015
I TOOK THE MIND DRIVE
OUT MYSELF.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.712
LAYLA:
HE'’S PROTECTING HER.

16:14.756 --> 16:17.585
HOW MUCH MORE PROOF
THAT HE'’S A TRAITOR
DO WE NEED?

16:21.067 --> 16:23.069
NO.

16:23.112 --> 16:27.073
IF YOU KILL HER YOURSELF,
I WON'’T BUILD YOU THE BOMB.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.168
GOOD.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.213
FIRST, WE GATHER THE TOXIN.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.823
THERE'’S A CAVE ON
THE WAY TO THE ANOMALY.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.651
YOU'’RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.786
NEITHER IS
YOUR LONG-LOST FRIEND.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.918
WE CAN DO IT.

16:46.962 --> 16:50.096
JUST TELL US
WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.022
YOU CAN LET HER GO NOW.

17:04.675 --> 17:07.548
MAN: SO THAT'’S IT, THEN?

17:07.591 --> 17:09.332
ONE SHOT,
AND SHE'’S A HOST?

17:10.855 --> 17:12.292
YES.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.294
ACCORDING
TO THEIR DOCTOR,
WE HAVE SOME TIME.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.644
I'’LL BE IN MY ROOM.

17:16.687 --> 17:19.212
ECHO: THE TRUTH SPREADS
LIKE THAT, TOO.

17:19.255 --> 17:23.085
OF COURSE, MORE THAN ONE
PERSON KNOWS THE TRUTH.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.260
DON'’T THEY?

17:24.304 --> 17:25.522
YOU GUYS CAN WAIT OUTSIDE.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.742
NO NEED TO LISTEN
TO HER LIES.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.403
HOW LONG BEFORE
RUSSELL FINDS OUT

17:36.446 --> 17:38.883
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
SPARKED THE REVOLUTION?

17:38.927 --> 17:40.711
ONE DEAD JANITOR
ISN'’T A REVOLUTION.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.583
WE TOLD AT LEAST
A DOZEN OTHERS,

17:42.626 --> 17:45.673
BUT YOU LET HIM BELIEVE
IT WAS JUST TAI.

17:45.716 --> 17:49.111
THAT TELLS ME YOU'’RE
STILL TORN.

17:49.155 --> 17:52.897
YOU'’RE RIGHT. I AM.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.641
THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN
MY PEOPLE BEING BURNED ALIVE

17:57.685 --> 17:59.469
IS IT HAPPENING
TO MY FAMILY.

18:02.298 --> 18:05.867
RYKER, WAIT.
THE TRUTH IS OUT.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.261
IT'’S TOO LATE TO STOP THIS.

18:08.304 --> 18:11.090
IF YOU LET ME GO,
I'’LL STILL HONOR OUR DEAL.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.353
YOU AND YOUR MOTHER
WILL BE FINE.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.919
NO, WE WON'’T.

18:14.963 --> 18:18.314
IT WON'’T MATTER THAT
WE DO THE RIGHT THING.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.577
THE PEOPLE
WILL NEED BLOOD.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.449
THE GUARDS WILL DIE
DEFENDING US.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.451
TELL ME SOMETHING.

18:26.757 --> 18:30.109
IF YOU COULD PREVENT
ALL THOSE DEATHS

18:30.152 --> 18:34.025
BY TAKING ONE LIFE,
WOULD YOU DO IT?

18:37.333 --> 18:40.206
THAT'’S WHAT I THOUGHT.

18:40.249 --> 18:44.210
I'’M SORRY, ECHO.
I TRULY AM.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.000
DAMN IT!

18:54.350 --> 18:56.352
WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY?

19:02.358 --> 19:03.968
YOU DIDN'’T FOLLOW ORDERS

19:04.012 --> 19:06.145
WHEN THE COMMANDER
BANISHED YOU.

19:08.059 --> 19:10.149
HOW COME?

19:14.805 --> 19:16.546
SOMETIMES
WE HAVE TO DISOBEY

19:16.590 --> 19:18.766
IN ORDER
TO TRANSCEND.

19:20.463 --> 19:21.986
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT

19:22.030 --> 19:24.337
WHEN WE WERE
FOLLOWING BLODREINA?

19:34.434 --> 19:37.350
MISTAKES ARE FORGIVABLE.

19:37.393 --> 19:41.397
NOT LEARNING
FROM THEM ISN'’T.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.229
MAN: MEAL TIME.
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.013
HANDS ON THE WALL.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.800
HANDS ON THE WALL.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.715
GAIA: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.412
GUARD: I SAID,
HANDS ON THE WALL.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.371
TRANSCENDING.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.298
LET '’EM STARVE.

20:16.302 --> 20:19.043
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

20:19.087 --> 20:22.090
THAT'’S THE BEST LIFT
I'’VE MADE...

20:22.133 --> 20:24.832
SINCE THE ARK.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.835
IMPRESSIVE. HIDE THE BLADE.
I'’LL GET THEM TO COME BACK.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.706
MILLER: WAIT. WAIT.
WAIT. WAIT.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.799
I DIDN'’T STEAL IT
FOR THE BLADE.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.982
MACHINE SHOP'’S
THIS WAY. COME ON.

20:59.910 --> 21:03.044
A DEVICE LIKE THIS WAS
ONE OF THE REASONS I LEFT.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.874
GABRIEL: I WOULDN'’T BUILD
RUSSELL HIS BOMB,

21:06.917 --> 21:09.398
AND HERE I AM BUILDING
ONE FOR YOU.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.141
NEVER MIND ME.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.490
I'’M RAMBLING.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.234
YOUR FRIENDS SHOULD BE
AT THE CAVE BY NOW.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.063
YOU KNOW, IT'’S TOO BAD
THEY TOOK AN ANTITOXIN.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.457
THAT IS ONE SIBLING
RELATIONSHIP THAT COULD USE

21:24.500 --> 21:26.894
A GOOD GUIDED HALLUCINATION.

21:26.937 --> 21:30.332
YEAH. BE A SHAME
IF ONE OF THEM WAS MURDERED

21:30.376 --> 21:32.334
BEFORE THEY WORKED IT OUT.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.382
LAYLA, I'’M--

21:36.425 --> 21:38.645
DON'’T YOU DARE APOLOGIZE.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.913
LAYLA: THIS BOMB.
IF THE PRIMES HAVE ONE,

21:45.956 --> 21:48.307
THEN WHY HAVEN'’T THEY
USED IT ON US?

21:48.350 --> 21:50.134
I DON'’T KNOW.

21:50.178 --> 21:52.789
PROBABLY BECAUSE TURNING
US INTO RAGING KILLERS

21:52.833 --> 21:54.922
ISN'’T IN THEIR
BEST INTEREST.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.141
THEN WHAT'’S IT FOR?

21:57.185 --> 21:58.926
JOSEPHINE AND SIMONE
WERE INTRIGUED

21:58.969 --> 22:01.058
BY A PATTERN IN THE VISIONS
OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED

22:01.102 --> 22:02.930
BEING CAUGHT OUT
IN THE ECLIPSE.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.324
DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS
TO STOP THEM,

22:05.367 --> 22:07.151
THEY STARTED LEAVING
TEST SUBJECTS OUTSIDE

22:07.195 --> 22:08.283
TO STUDY IT.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.545
NOW, NOT SURPRISINGLY,
BELIEVERS

22:09.589 --> 22:11.330
IN THE DIVINITY OF
THE PRIMES

22:11.373 --> 22:14.463
INVARIABLY REPORTED
SEEING US AS GODS

22:14.507 --> 22:15.943
OR AS ANGELS.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.511
WHAT INTERESTED
THE LIGHTBOURNES MORE

22:18.554 --> 22:20.730
WAS THAT THE AGGRESSION
RESPONSE OF THE FAITHFUL

22:20.774 --> 22:22.645
WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AIMED
AT THE LESS DEVOUT.

22:22.689 --> 22:25.344
BELIEVERS
KILLING NONBELIEVERS.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.736
UH-HUH.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.612
I SWEAR ON
MY BROTHER'’S MEMORY,

22:32.655 --> 22:35.963
IF YOU BETRAY US,
I WILL KILL YOU.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.415
JOSEPHINE
WAS RIGHT.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.548
THIS IS MOUNT WEATHER
ALL OVER AGAIN.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.593
THAT BOMB WON'’T JUST
CAUSE CHAOS.

22:57.637 --> 22:58.768
IT'’LL CAUSE A MASSACRE.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.204
THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY

23:00.248 --> 23:01.815
THAN USING A MASSACRE
AS A DISTRACTION

23:01.858 --> 23:03.556
TO GET THE SHIELD DOWN.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.775
LOOK, IF YOU'’RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE,
THEY'’LL BE FINE.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.343
PUT IN WALL RESTRAINTS
TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES

23:08.387 --> 23:09.953
AS SOON AS
THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM

23:09.997 --> 23:12.086
IS TRIGGERED
AND EVACUATION BEGINS.

23:12.129 --> 23:16.003
I TOLD YOU, I'’M NOT
JUST WORRIED ABOUT--

23:16.046 --> 23:17.613
THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.529
THE INSECTS ARE AFFECTED
BY THE TOXIN FIRST.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.531
THAT'’S WHY THEY'RE IN
TANKS ALL OVER SANCTUM.

23:22.575 --> 23:27.797
I'’M AWARE. IT WAS MY
IDEA. WHAT'’S YOUR POINT?

23:27.841 --> 23:29.582
WE USE LESS OF THE TOXIN--

23:29.625 --> 23:31.888
ENOUGH TO AFFECT THE BUGS
BUT NOT THE PEOPLE.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.890
JUST ENOUGH TO TRIGGER
THE EVACUATION.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.239
CAN YOU DO THAT?

23:35.283 --> 23:36.937
YES. BUT WITHOUT
THE CHAOS,

23:36.980 --> 23:39.243
I WON'’T HAVE TIME TO
TAKE THE SHIELD DOWN.

23:39.287 --> 23:41.028
YOUR PEOPLE WILL STILL
BE PRISONERS,

23:41.071 --> 23:42.812
AND THE PRIMES WILL
STILL BE PRIMES.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.771
WE WILL KILL
SOME BUGS, THOUGH.

23:44.814 --> 23:47.208
SO WE TAKE DOWN
THE SHIELD FIRST.

23:47.251 --> 23:50.516
FIRST, AS IN BEFORE
THE EVACUATION,

23:50.559 --> 23:52.256
WHILE EVERYONE'’S
STILL AT HOME?

23:52.300 --> 23:54.041
LOOK, CLARKE, I DON'’T
MEAN TO BE RUDE, BUT--

23:54.084 --> 23:55.825
JOSEPHINE COULD DO IT.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.610
THINK YOU CAN GET
YOUR CHILDREN

23:57.653 --> 23:59.438
TO LET ME GO WITH YOU?

23:59.481 --> 24:02.658
IT'’S DOUBTFUL. THEY'RE
NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.443
NEITHER IS BELLAMY.

24:09.665 --> 24:12.755
WE GOT THIS, GABRIEL.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.544
CAREFUL.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.197
GABRIEL SAID THESE
THINGS HAVE

24:20.241 --> 24:22.809
THE HIGHEST
CONCENTRATION OF
RED SUN TOXIN

24:22.852 --> 24:24.854
THEY'’VE EVER FOUND.

24:24.898 --> 24:27.857
TRUST ME,
THEY'’RE A HELL OF
A LOT STRONGER

24:27.901 --> 24:29.990
THAN JOBI NUTS.

24:33.907 --> 24:36.649
SO TELL ME ABOUT
THIS ANOMALY.

24:36.692 --> 24:40.522
GABRIEL SAYS THAT YOU
WENT IN AND YOU CAME BACK,

24:40.566 --> 24:42.655
YOU WERE SPECIAL.

24:42.698 --> 24:44.657
I'’M NOT SPECIAL.

24:44.700 --> 24:48.704
I WENT IN
AFTER DIYOZA,

24:48.748 --> 24:52.099
BUT I COULDN'’T
CATCH HER.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.884
DIYOZA'’S DEAD?

24:56.190 --> 25:01.674
YEAH. THE LIGHT
SWALLOWED HER,

25:01.717 --> 25:03.589
BUT IT SPIT ME OUT.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.373
I DIDN'’T KNOW WHY.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.331
BUT NOW I DO.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.815
IT WAS FOR YOU.

25:14.948 --> 25:18.691
FOR ME? RIGHT.

25:18.734 --> 25:22.216
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WHEN "I'’M SORRY"
ISN'’T GOOD ENOUGH?

25:25.175 --> 25:28.701
HEY. DON'’T STOP.

25:28.744 --> 25:31.530
YOU WERE RIGHT FOR
LEAVING ME BEHIND.

25:34.576 --> 25:37.753
I KNOW HOW HARD
THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN FOR YOU,

25:37.797 --> 25:39.712
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.497
I WAS A MESS--
A DANGER TO YOU,

25:42.541 --> 25:45.152
TO MYSELF,

25:45.195 --> 25:47.807
AND EVERYONE
WE CARE ABOUT.

25:47.850 --> 25:51.941
YEAH?
WELL, WHAT'’S CHANGED?

25:53.421 --> 25:55.597
EVERYTHING.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.382
THAT MUCH, HUH?

25:58.426 --> 26:01.603
AH, THE MUSHROOMS
MUST BE STRONG.

26:01.647 --> 26:05.564
I NEED YOU
IN MY LIFE, BELL.

26:08.436 --> 26:11.613
LOOK, I DON'’T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU OUT HERE,

26:11.657 --> 26:13.049
BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.921
WE NEED TO FILL THESE BAGS
AND GET BACK TO CAMP

26:14.964 --> 26:17.924
BEFORE THE ANTITOXIN WEARS OFF.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.669
YOU WERE MY ROCK.

26:23.712 --> 26:26.889
WITHOUT YOU
AS MY COMPASS,

26:26.933 --> 26:30.501
I WAS LOST.

26:30.545 --> 26:33.766
I COULDN'’T FIND MY
WAY OUT OF THE DARK.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.206
I DID THINGS...

26:40.860 --> 26:42.601
THINGS I
CAN'’T TAKE BACK...

26:44.690 --> 26:46.648
THINGS THAT WILL
HAUNT ME

26:46.692 --> 26:48.737
UNTIL THE DAY I DIE.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.655
I'’M NOT ASKING YOU
FOR FORGIVENESS.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.702
I KNOW I HAVE
TO EARN THAT

26:56.745 --> 26:59.095
ALONG
WITH YOUR TRUST.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.494
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, O.?

27:08.670 --> 27:10.803
SAY I'’M YOUR SISTER.

27:15.068 --> 27:18.245
YOU'’RE MY SISTER...

27:18.288 --> 27:21.030
BUT YOU'’RE NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.076
NOT ANYMORE.

27:25.339 --> 27:29.822
GO ON. WE GOT ENOUGH.
I'’LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.903
LOOK AT THAT.

28:09.513 --> 28:10.906
IT WORKED.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.696
WAIT. WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?

28:17.739 --> 28:20.873
TO TELL RUSSELL WE'’VE
SOLVED OUR HOST PROBLEM.

28:20.916 --> 28:24.006
HOPING HE'’LL KILL ME
FOR YOU, HUH?

28:24.050 --> 28:25.834
HE WON'’T, YOU KNOW.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.314
IT'’S A LOYALTY TEST.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.185
TRUST ME.
I'’VE BEEN THERE.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.667
I KNOW WHAT YOU'’RE
GOING THROUGH.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.888
YOU KNOW NOTHING. YOU'’RE
A KILLER, AN ASSASSIN.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.454
I'’M AN ENGINEER.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.195
YOU WON'’T BE JUST
THAT AFTER TODAY.

28:39.239 --> 28:42.938
FINE. IF HE WANTS ME
TO DO IT MYSELF,

28:42.982 --> 28:44.984
I'’LL DO IT MYSELF.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.768
ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING
YOU'’D LET ME GO.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.857
IT'’S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.467
I'’VE MADE MY CHOICE.

28:50.511 --> 28:51.904
IT'’S TOO LATE
TO CHANGE THAT NOW.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.166
NO, IT ISN'’T.

28:53.209 --> 28:55.342
AT LEAST...

28:55.385 --> 28:57.474
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
HAPPENED TO ME--

28:57.518 --> 28:59.738
SOMETHING I'’VE NEVER
TOLD ANYONE ELSE.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.174
YOU'’RE STALLING.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.744
OK.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.141
TELL ME YOUR STORY.

29:14.665 --> 29:16.189
QUICKLY.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.371
TOP THAT.

29:24.414 --> 29:25.938
YOU KNOW I CAN'’T.

29:25.981 --> 29:27.983
DO YOU WANT HER TO THINK
YOU'’RE USELESS?

29:28.027 --> 29:29.768
DO IT LIKE I SHOWED YOU,

29:29.811 --> 29:31.987
AND PICTURE QUEEN NIA'’S
FACE AT THE CENTER.

29:32.031 --> 29:34.076
HA HA! OK.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.865
IS THAT YOUR SECRET, THEN?

29:39.908 --> 29:41.823
YOUR HIGHNESS,
FORGIVE--

29:41.867 --> 29:46.001
QUIET. I DON'’T CARE WHY
YOUR AIM IS TRUE--

29:46.045 --> 29:48.612
JUST THAT IT IS.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.399
UNH.

29:52.442 --> 29:54.227
IT'’S TIME, ECHO.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.881
SANGEDAKRU IS
EXPECTING YOU

29:55.924 --> 29:57.143
IN 3 DAYS.

29:57.186 --> 29:59.014
YOU'’VE MASTERED
THEIR DIALECT,

29:59.058 --> 30:00.711
STUDIED THEIR CUSTOMS,

30:00.755 --> 30:03.976
BUT ARE YOU READY TO KILL
FOR YOUR QUEEN?

30:04.019 --> 30:05.804
YES, HIGHNESS.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.458
PROVE IT.

30:08.502 --> 30:12.898
THIS PIECE OF FILTH
IS A SANGEDAKRU SPY.

30:12.941 --> 30:16.902
IF HE GETS AWAY,
YOUR MISSION WILL FAIL.

30:16.945 --> 30:19.034
ASH, HAND HER THE BOW.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.132
RUN, YOU FOOL!

30:31.438 --> 30:34.441
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

30:34.484 --> 30:36.573
IMAGINE MY FACE
ON HIS BACK.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.926
NIA:
HESITATION IS DEATH.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.623
TAKE THE SHOT.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.589
WEAKNESS!

31:01.947 --> 31:03.252
UH!

31:05.776 --> 31:09.041
SINCE I CAN'’T SEND
AN ASSASSIN WHO'’S
AFRAID TO KILL,

31:09.084 --> 31:11.565
I'’LL GIVE YOU
ONE LAST CHANCE.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.613
KILL HER.

31:22.750 --> 31:26.841
IF SHE DOESN'’T TAKE
THE KNIFE AND ATTACK
IN 3 SECONDS,

31:26.885 --> 31:29.539
KILL BOTH.

31:40.811 --> 31:41.900
1...

31:43.989 --> 31:45.338
2...

31:49.168 --> 31:50.604
FIGHT BACK.

31:50.647 --> 31:52.388
SHOW HER SHE
NEEDS YOU, TOO.

32:04.357 --> 32:07.186
NIA: FINISH HER,
OR YOU'’RE FINISHED.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.796
I'’M SORRY.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.846
I'’M SORRY, TOO.

32:48.096 --> 32:51.099
MAN: SANGEDAKRU
IS EXPECTING

32:51.143 --> 32:52.796
A GIRL NAMED ECHO.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.845
CONGRATULATIONS, ECHO.

33:00.195 --> 33:03.155
DON'’T LET ME DOWN.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.200
GET HER READY.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.769
ECHO, VOICE-OVER:
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY

33:08.812 --> 33:10.597
I'’VE BEEN WIPED BEFORE.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.169
I'’M SORRY THAT HAPPENED.

33:17.212 --> 33:18.431
I DIDN'’T TELL YOU THAT

33:18.474 --> 33:20.389
JUST SO
YOU DON'’T KILL ME.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.176
I TOLD YOU TO SPARE YOU
FROM WHAT HAPPENS

33:24.219 --> 33:25.612
IF YOU DO.

33:25.655 --> 33:30.182
I'’M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT...ASH.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.140
KILLING YOU
WOULD HAUNT ME,

33:32.184 --> 33:34.969
BUT SO WOULD NOT
KILLING YOU.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.408
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN TO SANCTUM

33:39.452 --> 33:41.236
IF I LET YOU GO.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.760
I'’M SORRY.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.414
NO. NO.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.203
-AAH!
-FINE.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.425
GUARDS, COME IN.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.210
CLOSE THE DOOR.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.212
I NEED YOUR HELP
HOLDING HER DOWN.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.178
YOU MOVE...

34:10.222 --> 34:12.702
YOU DIE.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.140
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

34:15.183 --> 34:18.056
GAIA: WE CAME
FOR THE NOTEBOOK.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.014
WE DIDN'’T KNOW,
OR WE WOULD'’VE--

34:44.343 --> 34:47.259
HESITATION IS DEATH.

35:01.751 --> 35:04.276
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'’RE NOT BUILDING A BOMB?

35:04.319 --> 35:07.148
RELEASING IT IN THE WATER
WILL CAUSE IT TO AEROSOLIZE

35:07.192 --> 35:08.715
AT A LOWER CONCENTRATION.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.543
WE'’LL TRIGGER AN EVACUATION

35:10.586 --> 35:12.501
WITHOUT INDUCING
A MASS PSYCHOSIS.

35:12.545 --> 35:15.504
CLARKE: IN OTHER WORDS,
NO INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.115
OCTAVIA: HOW LONG
UNTIL THEY REALIZE

35:17.158 --> 35:20.292
THERE'’S NO ECLIPSE
AND TURN AROUND?

35:20.335 --> 35:21.945
NOT LONG ENOUGH.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.904
WE'’LL NEED TO BE INSIDE
BEFORE IT STARTS,

35:23.947 --> 35:25.427
WHICH MEANS--

35:25.471 --> 35:27.212
WHICH MEANS THE SHIELD
NEEDS TO BE DOWN
BEFORE IT STARTS.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.562
OCTAVIA: CAN YOU DO THAT
WITHOUT A DISTRACTION?

35:29.605 --> 35:31.520
BELLAMY: IT WOULDN'’T BE HIM.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.870
BELLAMY, IT'’S THE ONLY WAY.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.524
WHAT IS?

35:35.568 --> 35:37.657
I GO AS JOSEPHINE.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.703
IT'’S NOT
THE ONLY WAY.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.314
WE USE THE BOMB
AS PLANNED.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.229
RISKING YOUR LIFE
WHEN WE DON'’T HAVE
TO IS JUST--

35:44.272 --> 35:45.708
IS HOW WE DO BETTER.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.493
WHAT WOULD MONTY DO?

35:47.536 --> 35:49.321
CLARKE, IF YOU FAIL,

35:49.364 --> 35:52.367
IF RUSSELL FIGURES OUT
THAT HIS DAUGHTER
IS DEAD,

35:52.411 --> 35:54.456
ALL OUR PEOPLE
ARE DEAD, TOO.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.197
SO I WON'’T FAIL.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.417
OCTAVIA: BELLAMY,
IF WE CAN SPARE

35:58.460 --> 36:02.290
INNOCENT LIVES,
WE SHOULD.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.814
MAN: HEY, WHAT'’S THAT?

36:04.858 --> 36:06.381
DIFFERENT MAN:
GOT RAIDERS COMING!

36:06.425 --> 36:07.339
DIFFERENT MAN:
SANCTUM RAIDERS!

36:07.382 --> 36:09.210
WAIT HERE.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.299
MAN: EVERYBODY SPREAD OUT!

36:11.343 --> 36:13.171
NELSON: GET THEM
BACK INSIDE.

36:13.214 --> 36:15.129
I WANT THEM TIED UP
AND GAGGED
WITH THE PRIMES.

36:15.173 --> 36:20.221
LAYLA, YOU'’RE WITH THEM.
KILL ANYONE WHO RESISTS.

36:20.265 --> 36:22.136
MOVE TO INTERCEPT!

36:22.180 --> 36:23.485
ELIJAH, LOGAN,
GET TO HIGH GROUND!

36:23.529 --> 36:25.574
I NEED EYES UP TOP.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.924
THE REST OF YOU, SPREAD OUT.

36:32.799 --> 36:35.236
MAN: CUT THEM OFF
ON THE OTHER SIDE!

36:35.280 --> 36:37.107
DIFFERENT MAN:
SANCTUM RAIDERS!

36:38.457 --> 36:40.067
MAN: RETREAT!

37:04.483 --> 37:06.659
HEY THERE.

37:13.187 --> 37:14.232
JOSEPHINE?

37:27.332 --> 37:28.898
WELL DONE, JADE.

37:28.942 --> 37:31.771
YOU JUST CAN'’T PICK
A SIDE, CAN YOU, JOHN?

37:31.814 --> 37:33.425
THE ONLY REASON I'’M DOING
THIS IS BECAUSE EMORI DIES

37:33.468 --> 37:34.948
IF I DON'’T.

37:37.516 --> 37:39.039
ECHO'’S IN TROUBLE, TOO.

37:39.082 --> 37:41.911
I PROMISE I'’LL DO
WHAT I CAN FOR HER.

37:41.955 --> 37:44.305
JADE: GIVE US TWO SECONDS
TO MAKE SURE IT'’S CLEAR,

37:44.349 --> 37:45.785
THEN FOLLOW.

37:48.396 --> 37:49.441
NO.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.316
THIS ONE'’S MINE.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.884
GO. MAKE SURE
IT'’S CLEAR.

38:03.933 --> 38:07.415
IS SHE REALLY GONE
THIS TIME?

38:07.459 --> 38:10.462
YES. BOO-HOO.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.725
NOW, AS SOON AS I PULL
THIS TRIGGER,

38:12.768 --> 38:15.554
YOUR LITTLE DECOY
TRICK WILL FAIL.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.469
YOU BETTER RUN.

38:17.512 --> 38:18.687
HMM.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.139
CLARKE: I CAN DO THIS.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.619
BELLAMY:
GET THAT SHIELD DOWN.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.142
I'’LL BRING THE CAVALRY.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.448
FOR MONTY.

38:40.492 --> 38:41.623
FOR MONTY.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.243
SHE ISN'’T JOSEPHINE.

38:53.287 --> 38:56.421
NO, SHE'’S NOT.

38:59.946 --> 39:02.078
MURPHY: YOU MIND WALKING
A LITTLE FASTER?

39:02.122 --> 39:04.211
CLARKE, AS JOSEPHINE: RELAX.
IF THEY WERE GONNA KILL
US, WE'’D BE DEAD BY NOW.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.344
THEY KNOW
THAT WE'’RE HERE.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.916
CLARKE: WHAT? NO HUG?

39:15.353 --> 39:17.572
JOSEPHINE.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.921
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

39:18.965 --> 39:20.488
IT'’S A LONG STORY.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.185
SUFFICE TO SAY, I'’M AWESOME.

39:22.229 --> 39:25.406
WHAT I'’M NOT, HOWEVER,
IS IMMORTAL.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.755
GABRIEL TOOK OUT MY DRIVE.

39:26.799 --> 39:30.237
MURPHY: I REALLY DO HATE
TO INTERRUPT, BUT...

39:35.721 --> 39:37.505
I'’M A MAN OF MY WORD.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.202
YOU EARNED
YOUR PLACE HERE.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.207
TAKE HIM TO EMORI,

39:44.251 --> 39:47.123
AND CLEAR THE DOCTOR
AND THE REST OF HER
PEOPLE FROM THE LAB.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.431
WHERE'’S MOM?

39:54.217 --> 39:57.220
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT,
BUT IT'’S OK.

39:57.264 --> 39:59.440
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO RESURRECT HER,

39:59.484 --> 40:01.747
BUT THAT CAN WAIT.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.880
RESURRECT HER IN WHO?

40:06.229 --> 40:08.449
ABBY DID IT.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.929
WE CAN MAKE HOSTS.

40:09.972 --> 40:14.803
YES, BUT NOT HOW
YOU THINK. COME ON.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.414
LET'’S GET YOU
CHECKED OUT.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.459
CLARKE: SO I USED
CLARKE'’S NEURAL MESH

40:18.503 --> 40:20.243
TO STAY IN HER BRAIN.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.811
TURNABOUT'’S FAIR PLAY.
AM I RIGHT?

40:22.855 --> 40:26.467
ANYWAY, I KILLED HER
IN THE MINDSPACE.

40:26.511 --> 40:29.296
NOW HERE WE ARE.

40:31.254 --> 40:33.735
CLARKE: HOW ABOUT NEXT TIME,
WE CHOOSE A LESS CROWDED HOST?

40:33.779 --> 40:35.433
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

40:40.525 --> 40:43.005
AND WHAT IS THIS?

40:44.833 --> 40:46.748
THIS IS HOW WE...

40:46.792 --> 40:48.750
MAKE HOSTS.

40:48.794 --> 40:51.187
BONE MARROW?

40:55.714 --> 40:57.411
CLARKE, IS THAT YOU?

41:00.632 --> 41:05.680
NO. IT'’S NOT. SHE PUT UP
A GOOD FIGHT, THOUGH, KID.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.334
CAN'’T WIN THEM ALL.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.380
WE'’RE GONNA KILL YOU!

41:10.424 --> 41:12.644
WE'’RE GONNA KILL
ALL OF YOU

41:12.687 --> 41:14.646
AND EVERYTHING
YOU LOVE!

41:31.532 --> 41:34.361
HMM. HOW MANY DOSES
CAN WE GET OUT OF HER

41:34.404 --> 41:36.145
BEFORE SHE DIES?

41:38.931 --> 41:41.977
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND.

41:42.021 --> 41:43.762
IT'’S TIME
FOR MY NEW DRIVE.

41:43.805 --> 41:45.938
BEING MORTAL SUCKS.
