WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:05.739
[panting] Come on! If we
hurry, we can get there

00:05.773 --> 00:08.609
before the paper's even
delivered to Rarity's house.

00:08.642 --> 00:11.279
Maybe she won't
read the article.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.447
I'm pretty sure Rarity
is going to read a review

00:13.481 --> 00:15.416
of her new boutique
in Manehattan.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.485
I still can't believe we
all just blabbed everything

00:17.518 --> 00:19.620
that happened to
that reporter.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.123
I just hope it doesn't end
up being an article about

00:22.156 --> 00:23.724
how her friends almost
ruined the opening.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.361
I think you're all
over-reacting.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.696
Rarity is our friend.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.099
If any pony is going to
understand, it'll be her.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.603
I was wondering when all of
you were going to show up.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.705
[gasp]

00:37.738 --> 00:39.640
Now we can all read
the review together!

00:42.543 --> 00:46.447
Um, I have an idea. How
'bout we don't read it?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.716
What she means is,
before you read it,

00:48.749 --> 00:50.484
we should probably
tell you about--

00:50.518 --> 00:53.787
No, no, darlings.
Please, no spoilers.

00:53.821 --> 00:54.655
But--

00:54.688 --> 00:55.656
NO SPOILERS!

01:01.895 --> 01:05.399
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:05.433 --> 01:07.368
* Aaaahhh

01:07.401 --> 01:09.403
* My little Pony

01:09.437 --> 01:11.805
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:11.839 --> 01:13.674
* My Little Pony

01:13.707 --> 01:16.310
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:16.344 --> 01:18.346
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:18.379 --> 01:20.514
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:20.548 --> 01:22.650
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:22.683 --> 01:24.685
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:24.718 --> 01:26.787
* To have my little pony

01:26.820 --> 01:30.291
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:30.324 --> 01:34.128
**

01:40.401 --> 01:43.271
Now, is everypony ready
to hear what I'm sure

01:43.304 --> 01:46.307
is a stellar review that
describes in stunning detail

01:46.340 --> 01:48.342
exactly how each
of you contributed

01:48.376 --> 01:50.478
to the successful opening
of Rarity for You?

01:54.315 --> 01:56.217
[ahem]

01:56.250 --> 01:58.919
"Many a pony has tried their
hoof at joining the ranks

01:58.952 --> 02:00.754
of the elite fashion
trend-setters

02:00.788 --> 02:02.323
currently ensconced
in the boutiques

02:02.356 --> 02:04.425
of Manhattan's
famed Saddle Row.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.395
[giggle] Some might say it's
the ultimate achievement

02:07.428 --> 02:10.664
in Equestrian fashion and
never before has a reporter

02:10.698 --> 02:13.867
been granted such unfettered
behind-the-scenes access,

02:13.901 --> 02:16.170
until now.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.239
I wish it had been
more fettered.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.209
[mumbles] Ah! [mumbles]

02:21.242 --> 02:24.478
"I sat down with [giggle]
Rarity and her friends

02:24.512 --> 02:27.281
after the opening to
get the inside scoop.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.217
And what a scoop it was..."

02:29.250 --> 02:34.388
**

02:34.422 --> 02:37.325
OK, kid. You successfully
opened a shop in Manehattan

02:37.358 --> 02:39.193
and that's no mean feat.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.794
Most ponies might wonder
what it feels like.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.196
Here's how it's gonna be.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.831
I'm going to interview
you and your friends

02:43.864 --> 02:46.500
so I can paint a picture of
how it all came together,

02:46.534 --> 02:48.602
a word picture mind you,
not an actual picture.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.803
Any questions?

02:49.837 --> 02:50.804
Well, I was wondering--

02:50.838 --> 02:52.306
Let's get started!

02:52.340 --> 02:54.975
Ms. Rarity. You got
shops all over Equestria,

02:55.008 --> 02:57.245
but this was your first
time trying to make it

02:57.278 --> 02:58.612
in the big city.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.482
What made you think you
could tackle it on your own?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.717
Well, I wouldn't say
all over Equestria.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.553
I just have two
other boutiques,

03:05.586 --> 03:07.555
one in my home
town of Ponyville

03:07.588 --> 03:09.357
and one in
Canterlot.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.393
Uh, still, when I
decided to open this one,

03:12.426 --> 03:14.495
I was nothing
but confident.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.963
[ding]

03:15.996 --> 03:18.266
Let's just say that
if I could choose,

03:18.299 --> 03:21.369
I probably wouldn't do it
that way again. [chuckle]

03:21.402 --> 03:25.506
Well, it wasn't the
funnest party ever.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.376
It was a plum-puckered,
pig-pushin' disaster!

03:28.409 --> 03:30.778
After a lifetime of
awesome, I think everypony's

03:30.811 --> 03:33.781
allowed to mess up every
now and then, right?

03:33.814 --> 03:36.284
Wait, are you
writing this down?

03:36.317 --> 03:39.620
Um. It didn't go exactly
how I thought it would,

03:39.653 --> 03:42.323
but it um, started
out all right.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.429
Welcome to Saddle Row.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.731
An entire street lined with
the most fashionable boutiques

03:50.764 --> 03:52.433
in all of Equestria.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.967
If it's supposed to be
the most fashionable

03:54.001 --> 03:55.002
block of shops,

03:55.035 --> 03:58.272
where's Stinky Bottom's
Discount Hat Emporium?

03:58.306 --> 04:00.508
I suppose it didn't
make the cut.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.877
[gasp] Here it is!
Rarity For You.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.521
Rarity, it's lovely, but
are you sure you'll be ready

04:13.554 --> 04:15.323
to open tonight?

04:15.356 --> 04:17.525
[sniff] Ah-CHOO!

04:19.793 --> 04:21.762
No need to fret over
a mere moderate amount

04:21.795 --> 04:24.465
of preparation. My
clothes arrive soon;

04:24.498 --> 04:28.001
my sales associate after that
and with a little dusting,

04:28.035 --> 04:30.504
we'll be ready for the
Grand Opening tonight.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.574
Rarity! So good to see you.

04:33.607 --> 04:39.012
Your store, it's going to be
a very good place, I think.

04:39.046 --> 04:43.951
Mr. Stripes owns the building.
He's a very pleasant landlord.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.855
A-a-although he can
be pushy at times.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.524
OK, all the time.

04:50.558 --> 04:53.594
You've met my daughter?
The apple of my ear,

04:53.627 --> 04:57.965
the hay in my hoof. You
will let her work with you!

04:57.998 --> 05:01.335
It's just... I'm
dreadfully busy preparing

05:01.369 --> 05:04.905
for tonight's grand
opening, as you can see.

05:04.938 --> 05:08.509
There are only two things I
love more than being pushy.

05:08.542 --> 05:12.380
One is my daughter. The other
is miniature doll furniture.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.949
And I would sell my entire
mini-furniture collection

05:15.983 --> 05:19.387
to make my daughter
happy. You understand?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.792
I'm sorry, I just don't think
it's going to be possible.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.628
Let me say another way:

05:27.661 --> 05:30.831
hire her or I raise rent
until you no can afford.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.566
Oh, uh, welcome aboard!

05:35.135 --> 05:37.438
First idea! Instead of clothes,

05:37.471 --> 05:39.507
we sell glow-in-the-dark teeth.

05:39.540 --> 05:44.011
Like this.[clank clank] but
they'd glow in the dark!

05:44.044 --> 05:48.516
Golly, what a splendid
idea! [chuckle]

05:48.549 --> 05:51.118
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK TEETH!
What was she thinking?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.825
[scream] Fluttershy!

05:57.858 --> 06:00.928
Your assistance is required
in the stock room post-haste.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.099
Awwwww, hello.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.668
But what are they doing here?

06:09.937 --> 06:12.473
Smokey made too much
noise eating garbage,

06:12.506 --> 06:16.677
so Softpad's mother made them
move out of the trash can.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.179
Then Smokey Junior found a
nice home in the crawl space

06:19.212 --> 06:21.815
behind the building, but
Mr. Stripes demolished it

06:21.849 --> 06:23.817
so they were temporarily
camped out in the back

06:23.851 --> 06:26.520
until they found a
new place to live.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.789
No no no, I can't have a
family of rubbish-scented

06:28.822 --> 06:31.625
raccoons living in my boutique.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.461
* [booming music]

06:33.494 --> 06:36.063
Uh, did you hear that?

06:36.096 --> 06:40.100
Turns out there's a Club
Pony Party Palace upstairs.

06:40.133 --> 06:44.137
Turns out there's a Club
Pony Party Palace upstairs!

06:44.171 --> 06:51.144
* [muffled booming music]

06:51.178 --> 06:58.185
* [louder]

07:00.754 --> 07:04.024
I'm sorry. Could you please
ask her to turn it down?

07:06.494 --> 07:08.896
COULD YOU ASK HER TO
TURN IT DOWN PLEASE?

07:11.264 --> 07:16.436
TURN IT DOWN PLEASE?
OH PLEASE!

07:19.540 --> 07:22.510
Ugh. Foals today listen
to their so-called "music"

07:22.543 --> 07:24.144
far too loud.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.814
I realize that makes me
sound like an old mare.

07:26.847 --> 07:27.948
But this is business!

07:31.284 --> 07:34.588
* [booming]

07:34.622 --> 07:37.591
I wish we were having
as much fun as they are.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.027
Well, sweeping can
be fun too.

07:40.060 --> 07:45.799
Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.
Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.

07:45.833 --> 07:49.637
Only Twilight could make a
dance remix about sweeping.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.572
I mean, how lame
is that?

07:51.605 --> 07:53.273
Yeah, it wasn't
even catchy.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.608
Nope.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.645
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!

07:57.678 --> 08:02.983
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!
Sweep! Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!

08:03.016 --> 08:06.253
Apparently, DJ Pon-3
has a residency

08:06.286 --> 08:08.155
at the party
palace upstairs,

08:08.188 --> 08:09.923
but security won't
let me speak to her!

08:09.957 --> 08:11.158
[loud honk]

08:11.191 --> 08:13.927
Bahh! What in the name
of Celestia was that!

08:13.961 --> 08:17.230
You know how most stores
have a little jingle bell

08:17.264 --> 08:21.702
when the door opens? I thought
we should have something

08:21.735 --> 08:23.771
with a little more "pizazz."

08:23.804 --> 08:26.306
So I installed one of
Daddy's antique horns.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.009
[honk honk honk]

08:31.144 --> 08:33.914
Ugh! We'll have to do
something about that.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.249
After I think of a way
to quiet down that music.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.218
And after I finish designing
the window display.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.252
Ahhh!

08:44.024 --> 08:47.795
Wait. is this my merchandise
shipment from Ponyville?

08:47.828 --> 08:50.030
It's completely
disorganized.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.166
Ah! Uh. [gasping]

08:53.200 --> 08:55.803
Ah...ugh...ah...[SNEEZES]

08:55.836 --> 09:00.273
Gesundheit! Oh! Miss Pommel!
I'm so glad to see you.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.143
Now, as the sole sales
associate at Rarity for You,

09:03.176 --> 09:05.713
I hate to add to your
already overflowing plate

09:05.746 --> 09:08.816
of responsibilities, but
it looks as though we have

09:08.849 --> 09:12.152
just a tad more to do before
tonight than I thought.

09:12.185 --> 09:17.157
Actually, I...Ugh ah! [sneeze]
[sigh] I can't work tonight.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.092
Oh? Why not?

09:19.126 --> 09:22.195
[honk]

09:22.229 --> 09:25.065
[sneeze]

09:25.098 --> 09:29.069
Feel better, my sweet. We'll
manage without you, somehow.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.805
And we'll manage glowing
teeth and car horns

09:31.839 --> 09:34.341
and disorganized
clothes and dance music.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.643
Am I forgetting anything?

09:35.676 --> 09:37.144
[chittering]

09:39.179 --> 09:42.616
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.722
Well, opening a
store in Manehattan

09:48.756 --> 09:50.958
is a pretty big deal.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.127
It's natural that Rarity
would be a little stressed

09:54.161 --> 09:57.097
about how it was going...
since it wasn't going well.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.833
Still, I think she
handled it all right.

09:59.867 --> 10:05.773
The dream is doomed!
Doomed, I tell you! Doomed!

10:05.806 --> 10:08.241
I know things haven't
gone perfectly so far,

10:08.275 --> 10:10.410
but we've done this
kind of thing before.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.979
If we all work
together...

10:12.012 --> 10:14.848
I appreciate the offer,
but this is Manehattan.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.884
To make it in the
fashion scene here,

10:16.917 --> 10:19.386
everything has to be perfect.
The perfect location.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.690
The perfect clothes.
The perfect opening.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.725
Maybe we should
just postpone.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.728
Postpone? Darling,
tonight is the last night

10:27.761 --> 10:29.329
of the fall season.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.865
If we don't open
tonight it won't be...

10:31.899 --> 10:34.034
[sigh] Perfect.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.905
Yes. I know what needs to be
done. I just need more of me.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.273
Oh, how I wish I could
make copies of myself!

10:40.307 --> 10:43.410
Yeah. Making copies of
yourself always sounds

10:43.443 --> 10:45.713
like a great idea, but
before you know it,

10:45.746 --> 10:47.414
you're locked in a room
with fifty Pinkie Pies

10:47.447 --> 10:48.315
watching paint dry.

10:50.818 --> 10:54.722
We can do this and we can
stay true to your vision.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.926
You'd do that? Fluttershy,
you'll handle those

10:58.959 --> 11:01.128
strong-smelling
raccoons for me?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.930
Of course!

11:02.963 --> 11:05.933
Leave Plaid Stripes to me.
I'll handle her and her...uh

11:05.966 --> 11:07.735
..."good" ideas.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.237
Oh! Oh! Oh! And I can go
upstairs to that nonstop party

11:10.270 --> 11:12.205
and have tons of fun
and eat some cake

11:12.239 --> 11:13.406
and set up party
cannons and--

11:15.008 --> 11:18.011
...and then make
them be quiet.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.814
I'm pretty sure I know
somepony who wouldn't mind

11:20.848 --> 11:23.116
organizing this merchandise
shipment for you.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.854
I'm talking about myself.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.192
Oh PLEASE let
me organize it!

11:32.225 --> 11:35.128
This all sounds splendid, but
I don't even have a single

11:35.162 --> 11:38.231
employee and I'll need
the best of the best.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.400
Leave the hiring to me.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.970
Oh! This is it,
my dears!

11:43.003 --> 11:44.404
If you can handle
these problems,

11:44.437 --> 11:47.274
I'll focus on the designs for
the front window display.

11:47.307 --> 11:51.745
We'll show Manehattan what
Rarity for You is all about.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.915
Aww! What would
I do without you?

11:54.948 --> 11:58.251
What would she do without
us? Huh, let me think.

11:58.285 --> 12:03.857
"Darlings, I'm absolutely
doomed! Doomed! DOOMED!"

12:03.891 --> 12:06.126
Ha, I sounded
just like her.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.128
Hey, you're not writing
this down, are you?

12:10.097 --> 12:13.200
Now for the perfect
window display. Hmmm.

12:16.236 --> 12:22.976
* [thumping dance music]

12:23.010 --> 12:25.445
Ooo! I can't really
stop a super-fun party

12:25.478 --> 12:27.347
in the middle of
mega-happy-fun times,

12:27.380 --> 12:29.116
can I? [groan]

12:29.149 --> 12:31.384
What would Rarity want?

12:31.418 --> 12:34.321
Keep that party going
till the break of dawn!

12:34.354 --> 12:35.989
Really?

12:36.023 --> 12:39.359
Indubitably! And as for
the roof? Get jiggy!

12:39.392 --> 12:40.894
Raise it, Pinkie!

12:40.928 --> 12:43.563
Raise it like you've
never raised it before!

12:43.596 --> 12:46.266
Hah! If you say so!

12:46.299 --> 12:48.168
Oh please, Pinkie Pie!

12:48.201 --> 12:50.470
Never in a million years
would I say such balderdash!

12:53.907 --> 12:54.875
[groan]

12:57.177 --> 13:02.015
Obviously DJ Pon-3 only
plays the sickest of beats.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.451
I just wouldn't want her
to miss out on the coolest

13:04.484 --> 13:06.887
new music straight from
the back alley underground

13:06.920 --> 13:08.321
zip-zop party scene!

13:10.423 --> 13:12.359
I'd play the whole
thing if I were you,

13:12.392 --> 13:14.161
no matter what
other ponies think!

13:19.066 --> 13:22.202
* [Light Latin music]

13:22.235 --> 13:23.270
Awwwwww.

13:24.371 --> 13:27.374
Rarity for You is only
hiring the best of the best

13:27.407 --> 13:30.543
and to me that
means the fastest.

13:30.577 --> 13:35.015
Now...uh, before
we begin... [groan]

13:35.048 --> 13:37.484
Am I doing this right?
What would Rarity want?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.488
New plan.

13:41.521 --> 13:45.158
Who can be the first one to
tell me what fabric this is?

13:45.192 --> 13:47.294
That's organza.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.296
Are you sure?

13:49.329 --> 13:52.032
It's a thin, plain
weave, sheer fabric,

13:52.065 --> 13:56.036
traditionally made
from silk, so...yeah.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.305
I don't know the first
thing about clothes.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.440
Pretty much all I can
do is look at something

14:00.473 --> 14:02.475
and tell you if
it's clothes or not.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.913
This chair? [chuckle]
Not clothes.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.915
See if you can keep
up with me here.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.051
What are all
clothes made of?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.352
Uh, fabric?

14:12.385 --> 14:16.890
Bingo! But not in this
store. Uh uh. Not anymore.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.225
Oh no?

14:18.258 --> 14:21.494
Two words for you:
spoon clothes.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.898
All our clothes will
be made of spoons!

14:24.932 --> 14:28.535
[sigh] What would
Rarity want?

14:28.568 --> 14:30.971
You know, I like
you, Plaid Stripes.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.473
If it were up to me, we'd
have a spoon clothes store

14:33.506 --> 14:36.409
right next to Stinky Bottom's
Discount Hat Emporium.

14:36.443 --> 14:40.180
But it ain't up to me.
So...the answer is no.

14:42.682 --> 14:46.186
Personally? I think spoon
clothes ain't such a bad idea.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.922
Useful, too. Eatin'
soup. Stirrin' gumbo.

14:48.956 --> 14:49.923
Diggin' little holes.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.427
There. Perfect.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.364
Although, what
would Rarity want?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.632
Maybe she wouldn't
like it done by color.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.602
Guess I have to
start over!

15:02.635 --> 15:07.274
Hello Smokey. Softpad.
Smokey Junior.

15:07.307 --> 15:11.111
I have some,
interesting news. I...

15:11.144 --> 15:14.447
Oh, I'd like you to all stay
here forever, but...[gasp]

15:14.481 --> 15:16.083
What would Rarity want?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.552
You have to move
out! [sob]

15:23.623 --> 15:26.493
A window display is the
first thing customers see.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.395
And if they like it,
they'll walk inside

15:28.428 --> 15:31.364
and experience the glory
that is my boutique.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.201
I don't know which
one of you to hire!

15:34.234 --> 15:35.702
Just keep guessing fabrics.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.538
Daddy! Rarity's friend
doesn't like my ideas!

15:38.571 --> 15:41.074
Spoon clothes! Is good idea!

15:41.108 --> 15:42.509
* [thumping music]

15:42.542 --> 15:45.412
Oh no! Not a shopping
music mash-up!

15:45.445 --> 15:47.247
[gasp] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

15:51.751 --> 15:52.619
[gasp]

15:59.492 --> 16:00.660
[crash]

16:02.562 --> 16:04.397
When you write the story,

16:04.431 --> 16:06.299
could you maybe
skip over the part

16:06.333 --> 16:09.169
where we locked Rarity in the
window display? [chuckle]

16:13.706 --> 16:18.145
Hello? The door
appears to be stuck.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.347
Yep! We're working on it!

16:20.380 --> 16:23.716
Hm. Well, shouldn't let
this time go to waste.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.220
[chattering]

16:27.254 --> 16:28.521
How did this happen?

16:28.555 --> 16:29.789
I shut down the party.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.259
I told Plaid Stripes no.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.594
I asked the raccoons to leave.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.197
I asked a lot of
fabric questions.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.633
...just like I thought
Rarity would want.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.535
Rarity asked us to help
her with everything

16:42.569 --> 16:45.038
because she knows
all of us so well.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.174
She knows how much
you care for animals.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.476
She'd trust you to solve
the problem your way.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.178
Maybe we should all
do the same.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.813
Doing this our way
is what Rarity wants.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.683
It's not too late. Let's all
dig in and we can fix this...

16:59.652 --> 17:02.122
...before Rarity finds
out how bad we messed up.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.627
I'm sorry I asked
you to leave.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.463
The place is yours,
if you want to stay.

17:12.665 --> 17:16.069
Though I would like to ask
you all just one favor.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.443
I'm sorry I made you play
that unfun superboring music.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.713
But if you're up for it,

17:26.746 --> 17:29.116
I have an idea to make
the party even better.

17:32.219 --> 17:36.656
OK, I don't get fabric,
but I do get speed.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.691
And I need somepony
fast enough

17:38.725 --> 17:43.263
to help all the costumers
Rarity is going to have so...

17:43.296 --> 17:45.332
First one to the river
and back gets the job!

17:47.767 --> 17:50.203
IT'S A RACE! GO!

17:58.145 --> 18:01.181
Mr. Stripes, I owe your
daughter an apology.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.816
She's got good ideas and I
should give 'em a chance.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.418
So here's what
I'm thinking.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.161
Perfect!

18:19.466 --> 18:20.733
[crash]

18:20.767 --> 18:23.670
Wow, looks like we fixed
that door just in time!

18:25.305 --> 18:28.741
[gasp] Ooh. What's all this?

18:33.180 --> 18:35.382
The whole place
organized by style,

18:35.415 --> 18:39.152
cross-referenced by size and
reverse-indexed by fabric.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.420
She'll be able to
find anything

18:40.453 --> 18:42.289
in three seconds
flat. [gasp]

18:42.322 --> 18:43.656
It was some of my
best work.

18:46.226 --> 18:50.197
Oh, I knew I could
count on you!

18:50.230 --> 18:52.799
All right. I suppose this
is the moment of truth.

18:55.702 --> 18:59.406
[jingle]

18:59.439 --> 19:02.642
Rarity for You
is now open!

19:11.451 --> 19:13.753
Oh, dear, I wasn't quite
prepared for such a crowd.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.422
How will I handle
them all?

19:15.455 --> 19:16.956
My name is Blue Bobbin.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.859
I'll be your personal shopping
assistant this evening.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.761
Right this way,
everypony

19:21.794 --> 19:25.798
and one of our talented sales
ponies can help you out.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.800
Honestly, they were
all pretty slow,

19:27.834 --> 19:29.502
but they finished the race.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.704
Plus they knew a lot more
about fabric than I did,

19:31.738 --> 19:34.341
so I hired them all.

19:34.374 --> 19:41.381

19:57.364 --> 19:59.799
What better combination
than a boutique dance club?

20:08.608 --> 20:11.344
After a quick bath, they were
more than willing to help.

Ah, a blue corn reduction
with shallot confit, but...

20:17.884 --> 20:19.752
how can I possibly
enjoy it without a...

--Spoon?

ain't such a bad idea.

20:28.928 --> 20:32.732
Ah! Mmm...mm!
Exquisite.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.034
This is the most whimsical

20:35.067 --> 20:39.572

were so many problems!

enough on your mind.

to think that the opening
