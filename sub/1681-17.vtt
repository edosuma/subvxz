WEBVTT

00:01.650 --> 00:06.101
In March 2009, I'd been dating my high school
girlfriend Karen for a few weeks.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.022
My friends couldn't have
been happier about it.

00:08.061 --> 00:10.643
- Hey,everybody.
- Hello.

00:10.653 --> 00:12.484
Sorry,we,uh, we can't stay long.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.925
- What a shame!
- That is sad!

00:14.935 --> 00:16.666
Hey,are those real diamond earrings?

00:16.696 --> 00:19.837
Yes. Yes,they are. Thank you.

00:19.847 --> 00:22.217
I didn't say I liked them.

00:22.578 --> 00:24.609
Oh,well,I got a great deal on them,so...

00:24.649 --> 00:28.340
Cool. I'm sure all the exploited diamond miners
in Sierra Leone would give you a high-five

00:28.350 --> 00:32.191
if they still had all their
fingers. But really pretty.

00:32.601 --> 00:34.372
Meet me upstairs.

00:34.392 --> 00:36.704
They only need one finger to
give her what I'm thinking.

00:36.714 --> 00:39.735
Yeah. Ted, Karen's a douche.

00:40.704 --> 00:41.734
Thanks for sugarcoating it.

00:41.755 --> 00:43.525
"Douche"is sugarcoating it.

00:43.545 --> 00:47.717
Uh,okay, believe it or not,my friends
do not get a vote on who I date.

00:47.757 --> 00:49.708
It's my life. I call the shots.

00:49.718 --> 00:52.089
- Ted,now!
- Yeah,coming!

00:52.930 --> 00:56.961
I don't know what Ted sees
in that horrible woman.

00:56.971 --> 00:59.522
I mean,yeah, she's got boobs, but...

00:59.552 --> 01:01.193
well, I guess I get it.

01:01.203 --> 01:03.243
I think it's 'cause
they met in high school.

01:03.283 --> 01:05.244
She was his first real girlfriend.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.195
We look at Karen and see a jerk.

01:07.215 --> 01:10.656
Ted looks at Karen and sees the first
person to touch his wiener besides himself,

01:10.696 --> 01:12.627
his mom,and his pediatrician.

01:12.667 --> 01:15.117
Okay,well,it's almost 2:00 A.M.
I better get ready for work.

01:15.127 --> 01:18.489
How can they call that thing
you're on a "morning show"?

01:18.539 --> 01:21.069
4:00 A.M.is still the
middle of the night.

01:21.099 --> 01:22.521
I don't see how you do it.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.382
It's been almost a
month. I'm used to it.

01:25.392 --> 01:27.292
Plus the show's not half bad,right?

01:27.322 --> 01:29.633
- Totally.
- I've never seen it.

01:30.243 --> 01:31.564
Have you guys ever watched it?

01:31.604 --> 01:33.434
- Of course!
- I've never seen it.

01:33.444 --> 01:35.165
Really? What is your favorite segment?

01:35.175 --> 01:36.435
- Weather.
- I've never seen it.

01:36.445 --> 01:38.346
- You guys have never seen my show.
- Sorry.

01:38.356 --> 01:40.297
- It's true.
- That's what I've been saying.

01:40.937 --> 01:45.518
Okay,yes,it's dull and generic and we get
spanked in the ratings by that Korean channel

01:45.558 --> 01:48.310
that only shows Kim
Jong Il riding a horse,

01:48.350 --> 01:54.202
but guys,it would mean so much to me if just
once I knew my friends were out there watching.

01:55.672 --> 01:56.864
I'll tell you what.

01:56.893 --> 02:00.144
This Friday morning, everyone
can come to our place 3:30 A.M.

02:00.174 --> 02:03.026
We'll all put on PJs.
We'll watch Robin's show.

02:03.036 --> 02:05.386
Aw,you guys are the best.

02:05.416 --> 02:06.796
We just want to support you.

02:06.806 --> 02:10.078
<i>{\a6}3:30***</i>

02:07.227 --> 02:10.078
I just want to go to sleep!

02:10.247 --> 02:13.049
I hate Robin for not
being more successful.

02:13.889 --> 02:15.650
Hey,guys.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.942
Sad announcement:
Karen broke up with me.

02:22.813 --> 02:24.053
Go ahead.

02:24.083 --> 02:26.904
I knew you were listening! Yes!

How I Met Your
Mother Season04 Episode17

02:41.810 --> 02:44.901
Hey,hey, we shouldn't be celebrating.

02:44.911 --> 02:47.742
Ted's just been through a bad breakup.

02:47.752 --> 02:50.393
Look,buddy,tell us everything.
Tell us what happened.

02:50.403 --> 02:52.593
Seriously,spare no details.

02:52.613 --> 02:56.555
What did she say? What did
you say? How did it feel?

02:57.006 --> 03:01.247
If you were to do it again,
all over,would you maybe...

03:02.617 --> 03:04.448
How did it happen?

03:04.478 --> 03:05.748
It was the stupidest thing.

03:05.778 --> 03:09.981
I mean,we were just hanging
out, you know,being funny...

03:09.991 --> 03:12.401
You're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

03:12.421 --> 03:16.173
Ew,no,you're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

03:16.723 --> 03:19.214
Wait. What is this?

03:19.754 --> 03:22.625
Looks like one of Robin's
earrings. That's weird.

03:22.635 --> 03:25.236
- You're the fan...
- How did it get in your bed?

03:25.246 --> 03:26.786
I don't know.

03:26.826 --> 03:28.467
Have you been sleeping with Robin?

03:28.477 --> 03:30.057
What? No,of course not!

03:30.067 --> 03:32.679
It,it probably got mixed in
with the laundry or something.

03:32.739 --> 03:34.139
Why should I believe you?

03:34.169 --> 03:37.110
Um,maybe because I've
always been faithful to you

03:37.120 --> 03:40.221
while you've cheated on
me, like,six times,bitch.

03:40.392 --> 03:41.902
- Oh,snap! -
Cold-blooded!

03:41.912 --> 03:44.123
Right? Right?

03:44.133 --> 03:46.403
I totally should have said that.

03:46.413 --> 03:47.785
Why should I believe you?

03:47.825 --> 03:52.986
Um,maybe because I've always been
faithful to you while you...

03:54.257 --> 03:56.868
I love you...

03:56.878 --> 04:01.249
I knew this was a mistake.
That's it. It's over.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.361
And that was it. She left.

04:05.371 --> 04:06.641
What a story.

04:06.681 --> 04:09.203
So brave of you to share that.

04:09.233 --> 04:12.084
Wait. Those are your pajamas?

04:12.094 --> 04:14.105
You sleep in a pajama suit?

04:14.135 --> 04:16.545
Of course. What do you think I sleep in?

04:16.555 --> 04:18.296
A coffin.

04:18.346 --> 04:21.036
Dude,that doesn't look
comfortable at all.

04:21.077 --> 04:22.417
You're wearing a tie.

04:22.447 --> 04:25.399
First of all, it's a sleeping cravat.

04:25.419 --> 04:27.749
Second,it's not about comfort.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.301
It's about looking good all the time.

04:30.321 --> 04:32.441
Why do you have to
look good all the time?

04:32.491 --> 04:36.603
Marshall,let me tell you a little story about
something that happened a couple months back.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:45.596 --> 04:50.828
We were just having a "Who's hornier" contest
and we spilled massage oil all over ourselves.

04:50.848 --> 04:52.028
Nice pajamas.

04:52.048 --> 04:54.149
Can we use your shower?

04:56.290 --> 04:59.011
That's not a memory.
That's from a porn movie.

04:59.021 --> 05:02.542
Not just any movie. That's
the exact scene from...

05:03.043 --> 05:04.714
Never mind.

05:04.734 --> 05:07.044
The point is it could happen.

05:07.074 --> 05:12.556
And if it did,and I didn't look my absolute best
for those greasy sluts, I'd regret it forever.

05:13.777 --> 05:18.328
I'm sorry,dude, but that is just the most
ridiculous sleeping attire I've ever seen in my life.

05:18.338 --> 05:20.399
Anyway...

05:20.409 --> 05:24.011
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!

05:24.021 --> 05:26.821
Hey,guys,you know how in the future we're always
saying "Remember when Marshall wore a nightgown"?

05:26.831 --> 05:28.252
This is that time!

05:28.292 --> 05:29.313
It's a nightshirt.

05:29.323 --> 05:32.643
You can call it a Ninja
Star Danger Jock if you want.

05:32.673 --> 05:34.404
Doesn't make you any
less of a cross-dresser.

05:34.444 --> 05:36.095
Whatever,dude. It's comfy.

05:36.835 --> 05:39.586
So,flying to Neverland with
Peter and Tink, was that amazing?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.046
Ooh,let me go next!

05:41.096 --> 05:45.469
Was it nice to finally get out of that crowded
bed and take Charlie to the chocolate factory?

05:45.519 --> 05:47.179
Ooh,me,me,me,me!

05:47.230 --> 05:49.990
Um,something about Scrooge!

05:50.511 --> 05:52.691
Come on,guys. I'm carrying the team.

05:53.031 --> 05:55.652
I don't know. I lived
with Marshall for 12 years.

05:55.662 --> 05:58.973
Any time he's wearing
clothes at all,it's a victory.

06:01.234 --> 06:02.835
Ted,show's about to start!

06:02.865 --> 06:04.856
Be right there!

06:17.911 --> 06:21.062
Good morning,New York. I'm Robin...

06:22.522 --> 06:25.723
Marshall,I just found Robin's
earring on your dresser.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.075
Did you have something to do with
the other one being in my bed?

06:28.105 --> 06:28.985
What are you talking about?

06:29.035 --> 06:32.196
You've always hated Karen. You've
been telling me to break up with her.

06:32.206 --> 06:35.857
You did it. You-you put the earring
in my bed so that Karen would find it.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.048
No,Ted,No! I would never...

06:37.058 --> 06:38.888
- Admit it!
- There's nothing to admit!

06:38.898 --> 06:40.629
Then why was Robin's
earring on your dresser?

06:40.659 --> 06:42.550
He was accessorizing!

06:42.560 --> 06:45.401
Marshall,I swear to God,if you
don't tell me the truth right now...

06:45.431 --> 06:49.123
Wait! Marshall didn't do it.

06:49.802 --> 06:51.383
I did.

06:51.423 --> 06:53.794
I broke you and Karen up.

06:59.245 --> 07:02.717
You broke me and Karen
up? Are you insane?

07:02.727 --> 07:04.127
What gives you the right to do that?

07:04.147 --> 07:06.248
Ted,I did it for your own good.

07:06.278 --> 07:09.560
You just weren't seeing
how awful she was.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.841
She failed the Front Porch Test.

07:11.871 --> 07:14.011
What's the Front Porch Test?

07:14.031 --> 07:17.923
Ted,you,me,and Marshall have
been best friends since college.

07:17.953 --> 07:21.054
Think about how much we
all mean to each other.

07:21.084 --> 07:24.736
So when I picture the future,
I picture us all together.

07:24.746 --> 07:29.007
How we'll all be retired, sipping tea
on the front porch of our beach house,

07:29.017 --> 07:30.838
playing bridge all day.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.369
Okay,bridges are wild.

07:33.399 --> 07:36.020
Four of a bridge beats a royal bridge.

07:36.050 --> 07:39.852
I see your bridge and I
raise you three bridges.

07:39.892 --> 07:42.122
Bridge! I win!

07:42.512 --> 07:44.623
You have no idea how
to play bridge,do you?

07:44.653 --> 07:45.763
We're gonna take a class.

07:45.793 --> 07:48.105
It's important to stay active.

07:48.294 --> 07:53.246
So whenever you've been dating somebody
for a while, I do the Front Porch Test.

07:53.286 --> 07:57.368
You know,how is this person gonna
fit in with our group over the years?

07:57.378 --> 07:59.788
And when I think about Karen there...

07:59.828 --> 08:02.049
Bridge! I win!

08:02.059 --> 08:04.481
Fantastic. Another game of bridge.

08:04.491 --> 08:06.771
Don't read a book or anything.

08:06.801 --> 08:09.872
Look,dear... dolphins.

08:09.882 --> 08:11.262
They seem happy.

08:11.302 --> 08:16.435
I guess the chemical runoff from this elitist beachfront
property hasn't rotted out their blowholes yet.

08:16.445 --> 08:19.186
It will. That water will kill you.

08:19.196 --> 08:21.697
It is a toxic deathtrap.

08:21.727 --> 08:23.097
I'm gonna take a dip.

08:23.137 --> 08:25.008
I'll join you.

08:25.018 --> 08:28.179
Karen failed the Front
Porch Test. She had to go.

08:28.189 --> 08:30.500
I can't believe you did that.

08:30.530 --> 08:33.861
Ted,think about how awesome
you,me,and Marshall are.

08:33.892 --> 08:36.693
Seriously think about it.

08:40.174 --> 08:42.573
- We're pretty awesome.
- We're totally awesome!

08:42.583 --> 08:46.927
So whoever you marry,
whoever joins Team Awesome,

08:46.937 --> 08:49.767
the bar is set pretty damn high.

08:50.078 --> 08:53.049
Look, I'm not saying what
I did was right,but...

08:53.069 --> 08:54.369
You're better off without her.

08:54.399 --> 08:57.190
And if Clarence the angel
says it's true,it must be true.

08:57.230 --> 08:59.691
Okay,you know what?
Fine,make your little jokes.

08:59.701 --> 09:01.352
Seriously,why would you
wear something like that?

09:01.392 --> 09:04.123
- Lots of reasons.
- I bet you can't name five.

09:04.133 --> 09:06.194
One: No need to wear
anything underneath.

09:06.244 --> 09:08.384
I can vouch for that. Will
you cross your legs,buddy?

09:08.394 --> 09:10.285
Two: Sexy.

09:10.305 --> 09:11.516
I can vouch for that.

09:11.536 --> 09:13.596
Will you uncross your legs, buddy?

09:14.226 --> 09:17.948
Three: My Grandpa Olaf wore
one and he lived to be 107.

09:17.988 --> 09:23.079
Four: No elastic waistband leaving its judgmental
pink teeth marks around my Thanksgiving belly.

09:23.119 --> 09:28.542
And five: Every night when I
go to sleep, it's the freest,

09:28.552 --> 09:30.633
most wonderful feeling in the world.

09:30.663 --> 09:34.084
I feel... like I'm flying.

09:39.445 --> 09:43.517
So that's how I go to bed
every night: happy, weightless.

09:43.557 --> 09:46.278
with a heart full of
joy. What about you?

09:47.499 --> 09:51.821
I have to lie perfectly still
so I don't wrinkle my suit-jamas.

09:52.331 --> 09:55.012
But at least I'm not wearing a dress.

09:55.952 --> 09:58.823
So... how mad are you?

09:58.833 --> 10:00.633
I don't know.I mean,

10:00.643 --> 10:05.476
I guess if you guys feel that strongly
about Karen,then maybe it was for the best.

10:05.486 --> 10:07.067
I really am sorry.

10:07.097 --> 10:10.627
I hated doing that again,
but Karen had to go.

10:11.588 --> 10:16.140
"Again"? Wait. How many times have
you broken me up with a girlfriend?

10:16.150 --> 10:18.050
Never! Six.

10:18.060 --> 10:20.931
- Like who?
- No one! Angie.

10:21.512 --> 10:23.632
Sophomore year.

10:23.662 --> 10:27.994
She was just using you to get back at
her ex, and you clearly didn't see it,

10:28.024 --> 10:32.015
so one day when she was taking a nap...

10:46.711 --> 10:49.072
Creed?

10:49.472 --> 10:51.893
Oh,my God, I have to break up with her.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.715
So that's where my Creed CD went.

10:56.145 --> 10:57.475
Who else?

10:57.515 --> 11:02.697
Remember that weird sci-fi girl who wanted
you to propose after,like,two months?

11:02.707 --> 11:06.959
You barely even liked her, but you
were still thinking about it,so...

11:09.399 --> 11:13.771
Listen,Ted, you're great,
and this is so difficult,

11:13.781 --> 11:16.642
but I think we're looking
for different things.

11:16.662 --> 11:20.993
So,live long and prosper. Or whatever.

11:26.346 --> 11:29.076
That was you? This is insane!

11:29.086 --> 11:31.358
Ted,I did those things to help you.

11:31.378 --> 11:33.409
You're a commitment junkie.

11:33.439 --> 11:36.870
You fall in love with these women,
even if they don't deserve you.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.501
What if one of those women was supposed
to be the mother of my children?

11:39.541 --> 11:43.413
If there was ever the tiniest chance
of that, I swear I didn't do anything.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.793
Like with Victoria or Stella.

11:45.833 --> 11:47.804
Or Robin.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.484
Or Robin.

11:50.514 --> 11:52.626
Robin,Robin.

11:52.646 --> 11:54.977
Did you break us up,too?

11:55.306 --> 11:57.337
Did you break us up,too?

11:57.367 --> 12:00.238
Stop talking to me like I'm your enemy!

12:00.248 --> 12:05.190
You weep for these women, but you have
the luxury of not knowing what I know:

12:05.230 --> 12:09.182
that those breakups, while tragic,
probably saved you from a crappy

12:09.192 --> 12:11.193
and very expensive first marriage.

12:11.213 --> 12:13.253
Did you break me and Robin up?

12:13.293 --> 12:17.904
You don't want the truth because deep down,
you want me out there watching out for you.

12:17.945 --> 12:22.826
And deep down, you know that none of those women
were ever gonna be the mother of your children.

12:22.856 --> 12:25.258
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- I did what I had to do.

12:25.268 --> 12:28.869
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- You're damn right I did!

12:32.880 --> 12:37.592
Marshall, your grandpa
Olaf was a wise man.

12:41.984 --> 12:43.785
You broke me and Robin up?

12:43.825 --> 12:45.536
- No,it's not...
- I cannot believe this.

12:45.546 --> 12:47.596
I need another drink.

12:47.606 --> 12:49.887
You know,I feel a little
breeze down there. It's nice.

12:49.897 --> 12:51.367
Oh,you think that's something?

12:51.387 --> 12:56.209
Stand over this heating vent. It's
like your junk is on a tropical island.

12:57.850 --> 13:00.331
Little Barney says "Mahalo."

13:00.341 --> 13:02.932
Seriously,what is wrong with you,Lily?

13:02.952 --> 13:03.932
How could you do that?

13:03.962 --> 13:06.183
I did this because I care about you!

13:06.213 --> 13:09.624
I am so glad that is
the one you watched!

13:09.634 --> 13:12.465
Dear God,what happened to you?

13:14.296 --> 13:16.237
You didn't watch my show?

13:16.247 --> 13:18.288
The show. Sorry.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.778
Something special happen?

13:21.949 --> 13:24.090
Same old,same old.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.680
Lily just told us that
she broke you and me up.

13:26.690 --> 13:29.831
What? Broke-broke us up?
What does that even mean?

13:29.841 --> 13:31.772
And why are these guys
wearing nightgowns?

13:31.782 --> 13:32.643
- Nightshirts.
- Nightshirts.

13:32.653 --> 13:34.214
- It's a nightshirt.
- It's called a nightshirt,Robin.

13:34.224 --> 13:38.955
Turns out Lily has taken it upon herself to
sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.

13:38.975 --> 13:42.437
No. Robin was different. I
didn't want you two to break up,

13:42.447 --> 13:47.579
but you wanted completely different things
out of life and refused to deal with it.

13:47.609 --> 13:50.189
I could just picture that front porch.

13:50.209 --> 13:52.120
Mm,two of hearts.

13:52.160 --> 13:57.632
Just like the hearts of the two children I
never had because my lovely wife hates kids.

13:58.162 --> 14:00.013
Mm,a deuce.

14:00.043 --> 14:05.445
Exactly what my career dropped once I
decided to settle down and marry Ted.

14:05.455 --> 14:07.886
Bridge! I win.

14:08.927 --> 14:12.407
Well,I do not like
that scenario one bit.

14:12.437 --> 14:16.459
All I tried to do was get you
guys to talk about your issues.

14:16.489 --> 14:20.480
I didn't know I was feeding you the
words that would lead to your breakup.

14:20.490 --> 14:23.812
Hey,here's a fun question, just for fun.

14:23.912 --> 14:26.793
Where do you see yourself in five years?

14:26.804 --> 14:29.774
You know what's fun? Fun questions.

14:29.995 --> 14:33.006
Where do you see yourself in five years?

14:33.016 --> 14:34.856
Where do you see yourself in five years?

14:34.866 --> 14:36.557
Where do you see yourself?

14:36.567 --> 14:41.069
Not to put words in your mouth,
but you probably want to be married.

14:41.099 --> 14:42.779
I probably want to be married.

14:42.799 --> 14:46.050
You probably want to
be in Tokyo or Paris.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.492
I probably want to be in Argentina.

14:49.502 --> 14:50.432
Argentina?

14:50.462 --> 14:53.103
Or Tokyo or Paris.

14:53.623 --> 14:56.114
We have an expiration date, don't we?

14:56.144 --> 14:57.114
Oh,my God.

14:57.154 --> 15:00.306
Lily,you can't manipulate
people like that!

15:00.356 --> 15:04.528
I
- I've known you 12 years, and I can honestly say, I have never been more furious at you!

15:04.568 --> 15:07.318
- Look,I didn't mean to...I was just...
- No! I don't even want to hear it!

15:08.489 --> 15:10.490
Settle down! Let's just settle down!

15:10.500 --> 15:12.890
Now,I have one question.

15:12.930 --> 15:14.460
What do these bad boys feel like in bed?

15:14.490 --> 15:16.301
Come on. Let's go see.

15:17.032 --> 15:20.654
So,if it weren't for you, Ted
and I might still be dating?

15:20.664 --> 15:23.504
Or you would have stayed
together far too long,

15:23.544 --> 15:27.456
had an incredibly bitter breakup
and not even remained friends,

15:27.485 --> 15:30.967
and then you and I would
never have become best friends.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.899
Don't even say that. Okay?

15:33.909 --> 15:35.459
Stop hugging!

15:35.499 --> 15:39.730
Lily,you had no right to
interfere in my relationships.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.810
You got lucky. Okay?

15:40.820 --> 15:44.212
You met the love of your life in
a dorm hallway when you were 18.

15:44.262 --> 15:45.932
But that doesn't give
you the right to play God

15:45.993 --> 15:49.484
to the rest of us mortals down here
who are still looking for someone.

15:49.494 --> 15:52.785
You're so concerned about who you and Marshall
are gonna end up on that front porch with.

15:52.825 --> 15:54.596
Well,you know what?

15:54.626 --> 15:57.167
You can have it to yourselves.

16:01.888 --> 16:03.119
What happened to your jacket?

16:03.159 --> 16:06.571
Oh,soot,bread crumbs, placenta.

16:06.581 --> 16:09.612
Did you at least TiVo it?

16:11.122 --> 16:15.283
So you're this comfy every night,
and Lily still has sex with you?

16:15.293 --> 16:18.635
Yeah. That's what marriage is
all about,man,unconditional love.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.346
You can wear whatever you
want and still get laid.

16:22.146 --> 16:24.757
Tell me more about being married.

16:24.787 --> 16:27.458
Well,sometimes, when you're married,

16:27.468 --> 16:30.579
you wake up to the smell of
breakfast already on the table.

16:30.609 --> 16:33.020
- And coffee,too?
- And coffee,too.

16:33.030 --> 16:37.922
Sometimes,she'll even put out
a vase of freshly cut flowers.

16:37.962 --> 16:40.703
I love flowers.

16:41.093 --> 16:44.624
And sometimes, when you're worried you've
made all the wrong decisions in life

16:44.664 --> 16:48.756
and you're not nearly the man you
want to be, what does she do then?

16:48.766 --> 16:53.388
Well, she tells you that you're
great and it's all gonna be okay.

16:53.398 --> 16:55.699
That's wonderful.

16:56.129 --> 17:00.271
And she'll help you find
other girls to have sex with?

17:03.112 --> 17:04.462
I mean,I guess.

17:04.502 --> 17:07.653
Maybe if you agreed upon
that beforehand,yeah.

17:09.314 --> 17:11.825
Little guy had a big day.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.516
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

17:13.536 --> 17:15.836
Sweet dreams,slugger.

17:30.321 --> 17:33.063
The next night,I was still
angry at your aunt Lily.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.794
Until...

17:36.864 --> 17:38.925
What are you...

17:40.866 --> 17:43.466
Lily came by and explained everything.

17:43.476 --> 17:46.387
And she gave me this note for you.

17:50.499 --> 17:52.060
"Ted,I'm sorry.

17:52.090 --> 17:54.481
"It doesn't matter to me who you marry.

17:54.511 --> 17:58.342
"I know they'll be awesome
because they'll think you are.

17:58.372 --> 18:02.933
"To show I mean it,I put together a little
surprise "for you and Karen upstairs.

18:02.974 --> 18:04.285
Love,Lily."

18:04.335 --> 18:07.066
"P.S.Sorry the envelope
was already open.

18:07.106 --> 18:10.237
"I had to read what
she wrote. Marshall."

18:10.867 --> 18:12.677
Sabotaging our relationship?

18:12.717 --> 18:17.919
I got to say,even using the specially-ordered
extra-low bar by which I judge your friends,

18:17.939 --> 18:20.110
Lily really outdid herself this time.

18:20.150 --> 18:22.551
Obviously,we can't ever see her again.

18:22.561 --> 18:25.523
I know. It's a big loss,right?

18:29.534 --> 18:32.485
Hey,remember your old college roommate?

18:32.505 --> 18:36.426
He was married to that
shrill little idiot girl.

18:36.436 --> 18:40.437
Marshall. Oh,it's been so long.

18:40.447 --> 18:42.729
God,I hated him.

18:42.749 --> 18:45.239
Anyway,here's his obituary.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.972
And I realized, maybe it shouldn't matter
what my friends think of my girlfriend,

18:51.002 --> 18:55.033
but it sure as hell matters what
my girlfriend thinks of my friends.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.165
- So you ended it?
- Yeah.

18:59.775 --> 19:03.887
So if you want to be my plus
one, Lily's a damn good cook.

19:04.767 --> 19:08.929
Beef pot pie, mac and cheese,
homemade buttermilk biscuits.

19:08.969 --> 19:12.070
Well, no wonder Marshall dies at 68.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.301
Thank you.

19:15.341 --> 19:17.971
So,Robin and I enjoyed a gourmet dinner.

19:18.001 --> 19:19.832
Well,for her it was breakfast.

19:19.862 --> 19:23.594
And we ended up doing exactly what
Lily wanted us to do all along:

19:23.614 --> 19:26.045
we talked about our relationship.

19:26.625 --> 19:30.817
- So,Lily broke us up,sort of.
- Yeah.

19:31.947 --> 19:34.548
- Kind of makes you wonder.
- Yeah.

19:34.948 --> 19:39.530
I mean,if it weren't for her,
would we still be dating right now?

19:39.830 --> 19:42.111
Maybe.

19:42.611 --> 19:45.752
But Lily was right. We weren't ready.

19:45.762 --> 19:48.644
We both need to move
on, do our own thing.

19:49.333 --> 19:52.175
Still do,I guess.

19:53.636 --> 19:55.666
We should make a pact.

19:55.716 --> 20:00.607
If the years go by, and we both
turn 40, and we're still single...

20:06.960 --> 20:09.471
Robin Scherbatsky...

20:09.481 --> 20:12.642
will you be my backup wife?

20:12.672 --> 20:14.994
A girl always dreams
of hearing those words.

20:15.034 --> 20:18.624
Yes! Yes! A million times,yes!

20:25.787 --> 20:27.878
- All right,it's a deal.
- Yeah.

20:29.189 --> 20:31.240
So,should we set up some
ground rules for this?

20:31.290 --> 20:31.989
Okay,like what?

20:32.029 --> 20:35.000
I don't know. Like neither one of us
can get super fat. Stuff like that.

20:35.010 --> 20:37.482
Okay,I only have one: you
can't wear a nightshirt.

20:37.522 --> 20:40.953
- I will never wear a nightshirt.
- Thank God.

20:57.809 --> 20:59.730
Never mind.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.271
No!
