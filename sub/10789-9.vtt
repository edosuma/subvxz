WEBVTT

00:01.333 --> 00:03.125
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

00:15.792 --> 00:19.333
AND CUT ON REHEARSAL.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.375
HERE YOU GO.

00:20.375 --> 00:22.000
OH, YOU'RE
A BLOODY LIFESAVER.

00:24.917 --> 00:26.583
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
YOUR FOURTH ONE TODAY.

00:26.583 --> 00:28.166
I'M THINKING OF STAGING
AN INTERVENTION.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.875
EVER SINCE A CERTAIN
IDIOT ASSISTANT CONVINCED ME
TO QUIT SMOKING,

00:30.875 --> 00:33.458
I'VE TURNED INTO SOME SORT OF
CYBORG-LIKE EATING MACHINE.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.708
UH, I DON'T KNOW,

00:34.708 --> 00:35.834
THIS ISN'T
NICOTINE-JONES-TODD,

00:35.834 --> 00:37.000
THIS IS MORE LIKE
NERVOUS-TODD.

00:37.000 --> 00:37.917
NERVOUS-TODD?

00:37.917 --> 00:39.333
ONE OF THE MANY FACES
OF TODD.

00:39.333 --> 00:40.291
THERE'S DRUNK-
AND-BELLIGERENT-TODD,

00:40.291 --> 00:43.208
THERE'S SOBER-
AND-BELLIGERENT-TODD,

00:43.208 --> 00:44.667
THERE'S
CREEPY/HORNY-TODD.

00:44.667 --> 00:46.375
THE RAREST OF THEM ALL
IS SWEET-TODD,

00:46.375 --> 00:49.166
BUT THAT'S
USUALLY ACCOMPANIED
BY HIDDEN-AGENDA-TODD.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.542
THANKS FOR
THE ABUSE, MATE.

00:50.542 --> 00:51.583
TRULY.

00:51.583 --> 00:52.542
SPOT-ON.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.041
YOU KNOW...

00:54.041 --> 00:55.417
I FIND IT DEPRESSING
THAT EVEN YOU
ARE THROWN INTO A TIZZY

00:55.417 --> 00:58.166
JUST 'CAUSE SOME GUY
IS COMING TO SHOOT A CAMEO.

00:58.166 --> 00:59.792
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
A CERTAIN ASSISTANT

00:59.792 --> 01:00.834
GETTING ALL
HOT AND BOTHERED

01:00.834 --> 01:02.500
SIMPLY TRANSFERRING
A CALL FROM A...

01:02.500 --> 01:03.375
MR. SPIELBERG.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.917
OK, THAT WAS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

01:04.917 --> 01:06.708
SPIELBERG IS A CINEMA GOD.

01:06.708 --> 01:07.792
MAX WINTER IS JUST
SOME LAME MOVIE STAR.

01:07.792 --> 01:09.708
YEAH, WELL,
THAT SO-CALLED
LAME MOVIE STAR

01:09.708 --> 01:10.792
COULD DO
FOR THIS PROJECT

01:10.792 --> 01:12.875
WHAT JANET LEIGH
DID FOR PSYCHO

01:12.875 --> 01:14.417
OR DREW BARRYMORE
DID FOR SCREAM.

01:14.417 --> 01:15.542
D-DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

01:15.542 --> 01:17.708
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH
TO BOOK HIM, DAWSON?

01:17.708 --> 01:19.708
WE'RE EXTREMELY LUCKY
IT WORKED OUT, MATE.

01:19.708 --> 01:23.750
TODD CARR,
YOU FREAKIN' GENIUS!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.583
I FINALLY GET
TO WORK WITH YOU,

01:25.583 --> 01:27.291
AND I GET KILLED OFF
IN THE FIRST 15 MINUTES?

01:27.291 --> 01:28.750
FEAR NOT, ME OL' MOCKER,

01:28.750 --> 01:30.667
WE'RE BRINGING YOU
BACK IN THE SEQUEL AS
A FLESH-EATING ZOMBIE.

01:30.667 --> 01:31.834
SOUNDS GREAT,

01:31.834 --> 01:32.667
BUT WE GOTTA WORK
AROUND SPIELBERG.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.250
INDEED. INDEED.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.792
HI. I'M MAX.

01:35.792 --> 01:38.083
HI. DAWSON,
TODD'S ASSISTANT.

01:38.083 --> 01:39.917
YOU--YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
WORK WITH SPIELBERG?

01:39.917 --> 01:41.375
YEAH, WE FINALLY
WORKED OUT OUR SCHEDULES
FOR THIS PROJECT.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.750
SO, AFTER WE SHOOT,
YOU GUYS GOTTA SHOW ME

01:43.750 --> 01:45.041
WHERE TO HAVE SOME FUN
AROUND HERE.

01:45.041 --> 01:46.291
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
DAWSON?

01:46.291 --> 01:47.250
SURE.

01:47.250 --> 01:50.083
AND, UH,
AS FOR MY CO-STAR?

01:50.083 --> 01:51.959
THE LOVELY NATASHA.
YES.

01:51.959 --> 01:52.917
I WILL DEFINITELY
NEED A WORD WITH HER.

01:52.917 --> 01:55.250
I ALWAYS LIKE TO, UH,

01:55.250 --> 01:56.583
GET TO KNOW
WHOEVER I'M WORKING WITH.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.291
(CHUCKLES)

03:01.708 --> 03:04.208
HEY.

03:04.208 --> 03:07.166
HEY. DID YOU
JUST GET HERE?

03:07.166 --> 03:08.417
YEAH, 10 MINUTES AGO.

03:08.417 --> 03:10.041
I DIDN'T WANNA
DISTURB YOUR STUDYING.

03:10.041 --> 03:11.708
OH, YOU COULDN'T
DISTURB ME ANY MORE
THAN THIS STUPID SONG.

03:11.708 --> 03:14.708
COULD YOU PLEASE KILL
WHOEVER PUT THIS
ON THE JUKEBOX?

03:14.708 --> 03:16.834
THAT WOULD BE ME.

03:16.834 --> 03:17.625
OH.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.500
SORRY.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.792
IT-IT'S JUST
I'M TRYING TO STUDY,

03:20.792 --> 03:23.166
AND IT'S MY LAST
FINAL, AND IT'S
FOR HETSON'S CLASS,

03:23.166 --> 03:25.333
SO, OF COURSE,
THERE'S A LOT
OF GROUND TO COVER,

03:25.333 --> 03:26.333
AND I WANNA DO
REALLY WELL,

03:26.333 --> 03:28.875
YOU KNOW, AND IT'S--
IT'S THIS SONG. I--

03:28.875 --> 03:31.208
SO, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST STUDY AT THE LIBRARY?

03:31.208 --> 03:33.000
I TRIED. IT'S PACKED.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.834
THERE ARE PEOPLE SITTING ON
THE FLOOR IN THE BATHROOM
OF THE LIBRARY.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.166
WHAT ABOUT THE DORM?

03:36.166 --> 03:37.166
TOO MANY PARTIES.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.834
MOST PEOPLE ARE DONE
WITH FINALS.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.875
WHEN I LEFT,
THEY WERE HAVING A NAKED
SLIPPY-SLIDE DOWN THE HALL.

03:40.875 --> 03:41.583
MMM.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.583
MMM. HA HA.
MMM. HA HA.

03:43.583 --> 03:46.041
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD,
YOU COULD GO TO MY PLACE.

03:46.041 --> 03:48.041
WELL, WELL, WELL.

03:48.041 --> 03:50.041
SOUNDS SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE A LAME ATTEMPT

03:50.041 --> 03:51.291
TO GET ME INTO
YOUR BED, MR. DOLING.

03:51.291 --> 03:53.417
WELL, YOU MAY GET IN MY BED,
IF YOU PLEASE, MS. POTTER,

03:53.417 --> 03:55.000
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,
I'LL BE HERE.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.542
I WORK TILL CLOSE.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.583
BUT YOU CAN STUDY
AS LONG AS YOU WANT

03:59.583 --> 04:00.792
AND JUST LEAVE THE KEYS
UNDER THE MAT WHEN YOU GO.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.875
YOU ARE AMAZING.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.708
WELL, YOU KNOW.

04:04.708 --> 04:05.750
THE BEST.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.375
KEYS.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.708
THANK YOU. THE BEST.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.625
HAVE FUN.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.166
(UNDER HER BREATH)
STUPID MALE FLATMATE.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.917
BUGGERY WUGGERY
WANKERY--

04:14.917 --> 04:16.250
EMMA.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.500
THERE YOU ARE.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.083
WOW. MAY I SAY THAT YOU
ARE LOOKING RAVISHING TODAY?

04:20.083 --> 04:21.583
AND YET I CAN'T EVEN
SEE YOU

04:21.583 --> 04:22.291
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO TRANSPARENT.

04:22.291 --> 04:23.083
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
PACEY?

04:23.083 --> 04:25.291
VERY INTUITIVE OF YOU.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.708
I DO ACTUALLY NEED
A SMALL FAVOR.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.542
OK, BUT FIRST I HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU

04:29.542 --> 04:32.417
AS I SIT HERE SCRUBBING UP
OUR COLLECTIVE FILTH.

04:32.417 --> 04:33.417
SHOOT.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.041
HAVE YOU EVER EVEN HEARD
OF A TOILET BRUSH?

04:35.041 --> 04:36.458
YES. IT'S THE LITTLE BRUSH

04:36.458 --> 04:39.125
YOU'RE USING TO CLEAN
THE TOILET.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.166
OOH!

04:40.166 --> 04:42.250
OW, HA HA, OK.

04:42.250 --> 04:43.375
ALL RIGHT,
I--I DESERVE THAT.

04:43.375 --> 04:44.750
THAT'S FINE.

04:44.750 --> 04:45.583
AND THAT FAVOR
I WAS ASKING FOR,

04:45.583 --> 04:47.500
IT'S NOT REALLY A FAVOR
SO MUCH.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.625
IT'S REALLY, UH,
IT'S LIKE A PROPOSITION,

04:49.625 --> 04:51.291
WHICH, I THINK YOU'LL
HAVE TO AGREE WITH ME,

04:51.291 --> 04:52.667
IS A FAR MORE
ENTICING WORD.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.291
SPARE ME THE SALES PITCH,
PACEY, AND GET ON WITH IT.

04:55.291 --> 04:56.959
I HAVE BAND PRACTICE
IN AN HOUR.

04:56.959 --> 04:59.834
WELL, TO OUTFIT YOURSELF
FOR SAID PROPOSITION,

04:59.834 --> 05:01.708
WHICH YOU HAVE YET TO HEAR
THE DAZZLING DETAILS OF,

05:01.708 --> 05:03.166
YOU WILL BE NEEDING
A NEW DRESS,

05:03.166 --> 05:06.792
AND I AM WILLING TO TAKE YOU
TO A HOUSE OF HIGH FASHION

05:06.792 --> 05:10.000
AND BUY YOU SAID NEW DRESS,
WHICH WILL BECOME
YOUR FAVORITE DRESS.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.500
IT WILL, IN FACT, BECOME
YOUR HEAD-TURNING DRESS,

05:11.500 --> 05:13.417
AND IT WILL ONLY
BE COMPLETE

05:13.417 --> 05:15.959
WHEN IT IS FILLED OUT,
BY YOU, TOMORROW NIGHT

05:15.959 --> 05:16.959
AT MY BIG OFFICE PARTY.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.000
NO.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.458
SEE, SITTING IN
A FLUORESCENT-LIT OFFICE

05:20.458 --> 05:22.291
WITH A BUNCH OF DEPRESSING,
UPTIGHT SUITS GETTING DRUNK

05:22.291 --> 05:26.125
AND PRETENDING TO BE MERRY
UNTIL ONE OF THEM GROPES ME
IN THE COPY ROOM

05:26.125 --> 05:28.875
SOUNDS LIKE A LOAD
OF SOMETHING, PACEY,

05:28.875 --> 05:30.708
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY
NOT FUN.

05:30.708 --> 05:31.875
IT WOULD ACTUALLY
BE MY GUESS

05:31.875 --> 05:33.458
THAT THEY'LL TURN OFF
THE FLUORESCENT LIGHTS

05:33.458 --> 05:34.667
AND GO WITH THOSE TWINKLY
LITTLE STRING LIGHTS

05:34.667 --> 05:38.166
'CAUSE THEY'RE CHEERY
AND IT'S A HOLIDAY PARTY.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.000
AND YET MY ANSWER
IS STILL NO.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
OK, FINE.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.041
I'LL PAY YOU 25 BUCKS.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.625
SO NOW I'M A PROSTITUTE?

05:44.625 --> 05:45.875
(LAUGHS)

05:45.875 --> 05:47.125
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.083
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.542
I WILL CLEAN THIS BATHROOM

05:49.542 --> 05:51.667
AND WASH THOSE DISHES
FOR 2 WEEKS.

05:51.667 --> 05:52.000
6 MONTHS!

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
WHAT?!

05:54.000 --> 05:56.834
(SCOFFS) ONE MONTH.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.208
2 MONTHS OR NO DEAL.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.000
OH, YEAH. YOU'RE TRYIN'
TO PLAY HARDBALL. UH-UH.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.166
(MUMBLING)

06:02.166 --> 06:04.834
OK, FINE! DEAL!
(LAUGHS)

06:04.834 --> 06:06.959
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

06:06.959 --> 06:09.166
I AM GONNA GO
TO BAND PRACTICE.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.041
I'LL BE BACK LATER

06:10.041 --> 06:12.166
SO YOU CAN BUY ME
MY NEW DRESS.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.792
SEE YA LATER.

06:15.417 --> 06:19.583
OH, MY GOD.
I'M GONNA MEET MAX WINTER!

06:19.583 --> 06:20.500
I'M GONNA ACT
WITH MAX WINTER.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.083
HE'S GOT A LOT OF HAIR,
THAT GUY.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.375
I'M GONNA KISS
MAX WINTER.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.250
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
AH.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.166
HI.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.625
I'M MAX.

06:35.625 --> 06:36.667
UH-HUH.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.250
I BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA
BE WORKING TOGETHER.

06:38.250 --> 06:39.458
UH-HUH.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.500
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WANTED
TO RUN SOME LINES.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.625
UH-HUH.

06:42.625 --> 06:44.041
COOL.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.166
OH, HELLO AGAIN.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.333
HEY, MAX.

06:48.333 --> 06:50.083
HEY, IF I'M INTERRUPTING
YOU GUYS, I--

06:50.083 --> 06:51.041
NO. SIT.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.083
RUN LINES.

06:52.083 --> 06:52.667
GREAT.

06:55.542 --> 06:56.667
AHEM.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.750
"THERE'S A KILLER ON
THE LOOSE IN THIS CITY,
BABY.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.792
"STREETS AREN'T SAFE
FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU."

07:02.792 --> 07:04.917
"I'M ALL WOMAN
AND NOBODY'S BABY."

07:04.917 --> 07:07.291
HEY.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.250
UM...

07:09.250 --> 07:10.500
WOULD YOU MIND
LEAVING US ALONE?

07:10.500 --> 07:14.667
YOU SEE, WHEN
I'M REHEARSING,
I--I FEEL REALLY...

07:14.667 --> 07:16.166
VULNERABLE.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.333
RIGHT, OF COURSE,
I'LL--I'LL LEAVE
YOU GUYS ALONE.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.000
Max: THANKS.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.000
DAWSON, RIGHT?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.250
RIGHT.
THANKS, DAWSON.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.375
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

07:40.375 --> 07:41.583
(LAUGHS)

07:41.583 --> 07:43.500
THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD WEAR.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.667
IT'S SLIT HALFWAY
UP THE THIGH!

07:44.667 --> 07:46.792
WHAT CAN I SAY?
MY GRAN'S A SEXY LADY.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.667
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WE'VE
BEEN HERE FOR OVER AN HOUR.

07:49.667 --> 07:50.959
WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST TRY ON ONE?

07:50.959 --> 07:53.875
I JUST DON'T SEE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
MY REGULAR CLOTHES.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.125
YOUR REGULAR CLOTHES
ARE HELD TOGETHER
WITH SAFETY PINS.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.208
I'M CULTIVATING A LOOK.

07:57.208 --> 07:58.792
IT'S CALLED INDIVIDUALITY.
EVER HEARD OF IT?

07:58.792 --> 08:00.500
AND THIS IS CALLED I'M
BUYING YOU A FREE DRESS,

08:00.500 --> 08:02.291
SO STOP COMPLAINING.
YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT?

08:02.291 --> 08:05.333
NOW, JUST TRY THESE ON,
PLEASE.

08:07.417 --> 08:08.458
THANK YOU.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.458
(EMMA GROANS)

08:10.458 --> 08:12.792
Emma: I JUST--I DON'T
SEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS

08:12.792 --> 08:14.625
ABOUT SOME
LITTLE OFFICE PARTY.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.792
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
ACTUALLY A SMALL CONFESSION
I SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE

08:16.792 --> 08:18.291
ABOUT THIS
LITTLE OFFICE PARTY.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.834
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
LIKE YOUR AVERAGE
TYPICAL OFFICE PARTY.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.834
IT'S MORE OF A, UH, S--

08:22.834 --> 08:24.917
A WHAT?

08:24.917 --> 08:26.500
DAMN.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.333
I KNOW.
I LOOK RIDICULOUS.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.875
I FEEL RIDICULOUS.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.375
NO, NO. THAT'S IT.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.375
THAT'S THE DRESS.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.750
ARE YOU SURE?

08:34.750 --> 08:35.667
IT'S $300.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.082
OK, WELL,
THEN $300 IT IS

08:38.082 --> 08:39.833
BECAUSE THAT'S IT.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.332
YOU LOOK AMAZING,
EMMA.

08:41.332 --> 08:44.082
YOU'VE GOT TO WEAR THAT
TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.083
(WHISPERING)
Joey.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.166
Joey.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.834
Hi.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.250
(LAUGHS)

10:02.250 --> 10:04.375
SEE, I TOLD YOU
YOU'D FIND A WAY

10:04.375 --> 10:06.375
FOR ME TO END UP
IN YOUR BED.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.917
IT WAS ALL PART
OF MY DEVILISH PLAN.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.208
I KNEW IT.
HERE.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.792
I KNOW IT'S EARLY,

10:11.792 --> 10:14.375
BUT I
DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO MISS YOUR TEST.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.500
AND YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW YOUR
MORNING ROUTINE.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.583
MAYBE YOU NEED
SOME TIME

10:17.583 --> 10:20.083
TO ADJUST
TO CONSCIOUSNESS
AND ALL THAT.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.000
VERY CONSIDERATE,
MR. DOLING,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.542
BUT...

10:25.542 --> 10:27.125
I'M READY FOR IT.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.291
I SWEAR, I KNOW
THIS STUFF SO WELL,

10:29.291 --> 10:30.291
I'M GONNA
SET THE CURVE.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.625
I KNEW YOU COULD
DO IT, TIGER.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.959
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

10:37.959 --> 10:40.125
FOR CALLING ME TIGER.
I KINDA LIKED IT.

10:40.125 --> 10:42.250
(CHUCKLES)

10:42.250 --> 10:44.000
SO, ONCE YOU NAILED
THE MATERIAL,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.041
DID YOU MAKE GOOD USE
OF YOUR PRIVATE TIME

10:46.041 --> 10:46.625
IN MY HUMBLE ABODE?

10:46.625 --> 10:48.333
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:48.333 --> 10:50.625
YOU KNOW, LOOKING FOR
SKELETONS IN CLOSETS,

10:50.625 --> 10:52.959
DEEP DARK SECRETS
HIDDEN AWAY IN DRAWERS.

10:52.959 --> 10:55.083
NOW, WHAT KIND OF A PERSON
WOULD DO THAT?

10:55.083 --> 10:56.500
OH, ALL PEOPLE.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.166
ALL RIGHT.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.291
JUST THE MEDICINE CABINET,

10:59.291 --> 11:00.500
AND WE'LL DISCUSS
THE DANDRUFF SHAMPOO LATER,

11:00.500 --> 11:01.333
BUT I PRACTICALLY TRIPPED
OVER YOUR ICE SKATES,

11:01.333 --> 11:02.333
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

11:02.333 --> 11:03.542
AH, I--I PLAY HOCKEY.

11:03.542 --> 11:05.542
THEY WERE FIGURE SKATES.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.500
ALL RIGHT, SO I
MAY SKATE A LITTLE.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.083
YOU KNOW,
I HAPPEN TO POSSESS

11:11.083 --> 11:12.333
A CERTAIN
MASCULINE GRACE.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.583
YOU THINK I'M GONNA LET YOU
GET AWAY WITH THAT ONE, HUH?

11:14.583 --> 11:16.125
WELL,
THEN I GUESS I'M GONNA
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

11:16.125 --> 11:17.500
TO KEEP YOU QUIET.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.458
I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.625
NOW THERE'S A SENTENCE
EVERY GUY LOVES TO HEAR
AT MOMENTS LIKE THESE.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.500
(LAUGHS) NO, IT'S
JUST, YOU KNOW, UM, EDDIE,

11:41.500 --> 11:43.959
YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M--

11:43.959 --> 11:45.667
(SIGHS)

11:45.667 --> 11:48.959
I'M NOT THE KIND OF GIRL
WHO SLEEPS WITH A GUY
AFTER ONLY ONE DATE.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.375
REALLY?

11:50.375 --> 11:52.542
BECAUSE I USUALLY
SLEEP WITH GIRLS
AFTER ONLY ONE DATE,

11:52.542 --> 11:53.542
LIKE, AT LEAST
ONCE A WEEK.

11:53.542 --> 11:57.959
NO. ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT...

11:57.959 --> 12:00.542
I HAVE A CERTAIN PATTERN
WHEN IT COMES TO SEX.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.875
UM, LONG, PROTECTED,
TENSION-FILLED
WAITING PERIOD.

12:02.875 --> 12:06.625
YOU KNOW,
FULL OF DRAMATIC BUILDUP,

12:06.625 --> 12:07.834
YOU KNOW,
POSSIBLY LASTING YEARS--

12:07.834 --> 12:08.875
JOEY,

12:08.875 --> 12:13.542
I WASN'T, YOU KNOW,
EXPECTING ANYTHING HERE.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.375
I DON'T MIND
TAKING IT SLOW.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.792
THAT'S NICE,

12:17.792 --> 12:22.333
UM, BUT, UM,
IT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.417
SEE...

12:24.417 --> 12:29.417
I WAS SORT OF TELLING YOU
ABOUT MY PATTERN BECAUSE...

12:29.417 --> 12:32.583
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
I REACHED MY ARM ACROSS THE BED

12:32.583 --> 12:33.875
KIND OF WISHING THAT YOU

12:33.875 --> 12:36.959
HADN'T TAKEN THE FLOOR
LAST NIGHT.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.667
AND, UM...

12:42.375 --> 12:46.041
I WAS LYING HERE JUST
TRYING TO THINK OF ONE REASON

12:46.041 --> 12:48.834
NOT TO BREAK
MY TRADITION WITH YOU,

12:48.834 --> 12:51.417
RIGHT HERE,

12:51.417 --> 12:55.208
AND I COULDN'T
THINK OF ONE.

12:57.625 --> 13:01.667
YOU CAN SAY
SOMETHING QUICK RIGHT NOW
BEFORE I DIE OF EMBARRASSMENT.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.375
HOW'S THAT?

13:09.375 --> 13:10.708
IS THAT OK?

13:10.708 --> 13:11.750
THAT'LL DO.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.125
THAT'LL DO.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.208
(BOTH LAUGH)

14:00.375 --> 14:01.375
HI.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.458
HI.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.375
WOULD IT BE
INCREDIBLY CORNY

14:09.375 --> 14:12.000
IF I TOLD YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL
YOU LOOK RIGHT NOW?

14:13.708 --> 14:17.500
YES, AND
ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE

14:17.500 --> 14:20.250
SINCE I PLAN ON
NEVER CALLING YOU AGAIN.

14:20.250 --> 14:23.959
WELL, AHEM, THEN
AT LEAST LET ME MAKE YOU
SOME FRENCH TOAST

14:23.959 --> 14:27.000
AS A WAY OF SAYING
GOOD-BYE AND BEST WISHES.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.333
WELL, THAT
COULD BE ARRANGED,

14:29.333 --> 14:31.625
BUT ONLY IF YOU
HELP ME STUDY
WHILE WE EAT.

14:31.625 --> 14:33.166
I THINK
I COULD DO THAT.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.125
HOW MUCH TIME
YOU HAVE?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.333
MY EXAM'S AT 9:00

14:36.333 --> 14:39.208
AND IT WAS BARELY
SUNRISE WHEN
YOU WOKE ME UP,

14:39.208 --> 14:41.041
SO IT CAN'T
BE MUCH LATER
THAN THAT, RIGHT?

14:41.041 --> 14:44.708
YEAH. ARE YOU SAYING
THAT A PROPER AMOUNT
OF TIME WASN'T PAID TO A--

14:44.708 --> 14:47.542
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.083
LET ME SEE.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.250
11:00!

14:55.250 --> 14:56.583
OH, MY GOD!
IT'S 11:00!

14:56.583 --> 14:58.542
WAIT. ARE--ARE YOU SURE?

14:58.542 --> 14:59.083
HOW COULD YOU
LET ME FALL ASLEEP?

14:59.083 --> 15:00.458
I DIDN'T. I MEAN,

15:00.458 --> 15:01.625
I DID, YOU KNOW,

15:01.625 --> 15:03.875
BUT WE BOTH SORTA JUST
PASSED OUT AND IT WAS NICE.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.500
IT WAS NICE?
YEAH, IT WAS.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.125
LOOK, MAYBE I'M MORE FOND OF
SPOONING THAN THE AVERAGE GUY.

15:07.125 --> 15:08.708
OK, I'M SORRY
I LET YOU FALL ASLEEP,

15:08.708 --> 15:09.875
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
I HAD TO BE ON POTTER-WATCH.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.083
OH, AND I SUPPOSE
IT'S MY FAULT

15:11.083 --> 15:12.458
FOR NOT SAYING,
"HEY, EDDIE,

15:12.458 --> 15:15.041
DON'T LET ME SLEEP
THROUGH MY MONSTROUSLY
IMPORTANT EXAM."

15:15.041 --> 15:16.208
YES, IT WAS
A NICE MOMENT,

15:16.208 --> 15:17.750
BUT ONE WE COULD'VE
HAD LATER ON TODAY

15:17.750 --> 15:18.708
BEFORE
MY LIFE IS RUINED.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.375
HOW COULD I SLEEP
HERE LAST NIGHT?

15:20.375 --> 15:21.583
WHAT THE HELL
WAS I THINKING?

15:21.583 --> 15:23.333
OK, CALM DOWN. OK?

15:23.333 --> 15:24.333
I HAVE ONE HOUR LEFT
IN MY 3-HOUR EXAM.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.917
I'M 20 MINUTES AWAY
FROM CAMPUS,

15:25.917 --> 15:27.417
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO CALM DOWN?

15:27.417 --> 15:29.417
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
LOOK, I'LL HAVE YOU
THERE IN 10 MINUTES.

15:29.417 --> 15:30.417
LET'S GO.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.208
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

15:38.625 --> 15:39.583
JOEY,

15:39.583 --> 15:41.583
HEY, JOEY, JOEY!

16:02.625 --> 16:05.458
THAT'S HALF-HOUR.

16:05.458 --> 16:08.083
YOU HAVE 30 MINUTES
TO COMPLETE THE EXAM.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.250
WITTER.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.667
ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE
THE LOVELY CANDACE,

16:31.667 --> 16:33.792
MY DATE FOR
THIS EVENING'S
FESTIVITIES.

16:33.792 --> 16:34.875
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

16:34.875 --> 16:35.708
LIKEWISE.

16:35.708 --> 16:36.792
AND WHERE MIGHT
YOUR DATE BE?

16:36.792 --> 16:39.458
SHE'S ON HER WAY.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.041
HMM.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.834
OH! GOD.

16:52.834 --> 16:54.000
SORRY.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.667
HI, PACEY. I ALMOST
COULDN'T FIND YOU.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.291
THERE'S SO MANY SUITS,

16:57.291 --> 17:01.000
IT'S LIKE LOOKING
FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL COW
IN A WHOLE FIELD OF 'EM.

17:01.000 --> 17:01.625
HI.

17:01.625 --> 17:02.625
I'M EMMA.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.208
HI. RICH RINALDI.

17:05.208 --> 17:06.500
AND THIS IS CANDACE.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.333
WHAT
A FABULOUS DRESS.

17:09.333 --> 17:12.000
THANK YOU.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.165
PACEY BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.165
I DID HAVE TO MAKE A FEW
MODIFICATIONS, OF COURSE.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.208
I HOPE HE DOESN'T MIND.

17:17.208 --> 17:18.500
OH, NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.541
UM, COULD YOU TWO EXCUSE US
FOR JUST ONE SECOND?

17:20.541 --> 17:21.708
EMMA, MAY I HAVE
A WORD IN PRIVATE?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.916
BE RIGHT BACK.

17:23.916 --> 17:26.333
(CHUCKLES)
UH-HUH.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.750
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO THAT DRESS?

17:30.750 --> 17:33.083
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

17:33.083 --> 17:34.458
LIKE IT?

17:34.458 --> 17:35.625
I SPENT $300 ON IT

17:35.625 --> 17:37.917
AND I MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE BOUGHT YOU A BOX OF RAGS.

17:37.917 --> 17:40.041
RAGS?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

17:40.041 --> 17:42.166
FEEL THIS FABRIC.
THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF.

17:42.166 --> 17:43.667
THE KITCHEN SHEARS
WENT THROUGH IT
LIKE BUTTER.

17:43.667 --> 17:46.291
I--I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO THAT.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.083
I SHALL BE
BY THE PUNCH BOWL.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.417
IF YOU LIKE
TWIRLING ME ABOUT,

17:50.417 --> 17:51.625
COME FIND ME.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.834
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

17:59.333 --> 18:00.792
SO, DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ALL NIGHT

18:00.792 --> 18:01.542
OR DO YOU
WANT TO DANCE?

18:01.542 --> 18:03.583
FIRST THINGS FIRST,
BABY.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.667
AND...

18:18.667 --> 18:19.583
CUT!

18:19.583 --> 18:21.083
BEAUTIFUL!

18:21.083 --> 18:22.959
THAT WAS HOT, GUYS!
LOVED IT!

18:25.125 --> 18:26.917
THEY'VE GOT REALLY GOOD
CHEMISTRY, DIDN'T YOU THINK?

18:26.917 --> 18:28.542
UH, SURE.

18:28.542 --> 18:29.375
YEAH.
YEAH.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.917
THAT LAST TAKE
WAS KILLER, HUH?

18:32.917 --> 18:34.250
I WAS TOTALLY
IN THE MOMENT.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.583
Max through headset:
YEAH, ME, TOO.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.125
SO, YOUR BOYFRIEND
PROBABLY ISN'T TOO HAPPY
ABOUT ME KISSING YOU.

18:38.125 --> 18:40.250
OH, I DON'T
HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.083
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY
FROM YOUR TRAILER?

18:42.083 --> 18:43.083
ARE YOU TWO--

18:43.083 --> 18:44.417
WHO? DAWSON?

18:44.417 --> 18:46.208
GOD, NO, HE'S A P.A.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.708
THAT'S COOL.

18:47.708 --> 18:50.417
SO DO YOU WANNA WORK ON
THE DANCE MOVES AGAIN?

18:50.417 --> 18:51.708
SURE.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.333
OUT...AND BACK.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.542
DAWSON.

19:07.542 --> 19:08.500
YEAH.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.375
COULD YOU GET ME
A CUP OF COFFEE, MATE?

19:12.458 --> 19:13.959
SURE.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.291
(DOORBELL RINGS)

19:35.208 --> 19:38.917
OH, GOODIE,
I WAS HOPIN'
IT WAS YOU.

19:38.917 --> 19:41.166
I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU AT HOME.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.208
I WENT TO YOUR OFFICE
AND YOUR CLASSROOM.
I COULDN'T FIND YOU,

19:43.208 --> 19:45.291
AND I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

19:45.291 --> 19:46.208
YEAH, NO, I KNOW,

19:46.208 --> 19:47.500
I WAS MADE AWARE
OF YOUR SITUATION

19:47.500 --> 19:49.166
THROUGH THE 27
MESSAGES YOU LEFT ON
MY OFFICE VOICEMAIL.

19:49.166 --> 19:51.917
WELL, LOOK,
I STUDIED FOR YOUR TEST

19:51.917 --> 19:53.792
MORE THAN I'VE EVER STUDIED
FOR ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.500
AND YOU KNOW HOW FAR
I'VE COME IN YOUR CLASS,

19:56.500 --> 19:58.083
IT'S JUST THAT--

19:58.083 --> 20:00.625
WELL, I LOST
TRACK OF TIME AND--

20:00.625 --> 20:02.959
GAZING INTO THE ABYSS
OF YOUR FUTURE AGAIN?

20:02.959 --> 20:04.542
LOOK,
LET ME HAVE A RE-TEST.

20:04.542 --> 20:06.333
NO.

20:06.333 --> 20:09.125
LOOK, I WAS UP
ALL NIGHT STUDYING!

20:09.125 --> 20:10.708
I FELL ASLEEP AND
THEN I WOKE UP EARLY,
BEFORE SUNRISE EARLY,

20:10.708 --> 20:14.083
AND THEN
I FELL BACK ASLEEP,
AND I WAS DISORIENTED,

20:14.083 --> 20:17.458
I WASN'T
EVEN IN MY OWN--

20:17.458 --> 20:19.250
WASN'T EVEN
IN YOUR OWN WHAT?

20:21.291 --> 20:24.667
I WASN'T EVEN
IN MY OWN ROOM.

20:24.667 --> 20:27.417
LOOK...

20:27.417 --> 20:31.041
IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO GET TO THE TEST ON TIME,

20:31.041 --> 20:32.917
AND SINCE YOU COULDN'T GET
PAST QUESTION NUMBER ONE,
THAT'S AN AUTOMATIC "F,"

20:32.917 --> 20:36.458
WHICH BRINGS YOUR GRADE
FOR THE SEMESTER
TO A NICE, HEALTHY "D."

20:36.458 --> 20:39.708
SO, YOU SEE,
IT-IT'S NOT SO BAD.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.208
YOU STILL PASS.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.208
NIGHT, POTTER.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.208
OH, PROFESSOR HETSON,

20:43.208 --> 20:44.208
NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT ME PERSONALLY,

20:44.208 --> 20:46.959
YOU CAN'T BE
THIS VINDICTIVE.

20:46.959 --> 20:49.500
ALL RIGHT, NOW, SEE,
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

20:49.500 --> 20:52.500
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT VINDICTIVENESS.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.083
THIS IS
ABOUT RATIONALITY.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.208
I HAVE TO APPLY THE
SAME SET OF STANDARDS
TO ALL OF MY STUDENTS

20:56.208 --> 20:59.166
OR ELSE I'M
REALLY NOT BEING FAIR.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.000
IT'S NOTHIN' PERSONAL.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
IT'S A TOUGH BREAK, KID.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.500
I FEEL FOR YA.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.959
I WON'T LET YOU DIE.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.625
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR ME, BABY.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.625
JUST PROMISE ME
ONE THING.

21:47.625 --> 21:51.750
KEEP ON DANCING.

21:51.750 --> 21:57.000
NOOOOOO!

21:57.000 --> 22:00.041
Todd: AND...CUT!

22:00.041 --> 22:01.083
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!

22:01.083 --> 22:02.875
CHECK THE GATE!

22:02.875 --> 22:04.083
THAT'S A WRAP ON MAX!

22:04.083 --> 22:05.959
LET'S ALL CONGRATULATE MAX
ON A JOB WELL DONE, YEAH?

22:05.959 --> 22:06.917
(APPLAUSE)

22:06.917 --> 22:09.166
AND ON SCHEDULE.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.041
HATE TO LOSE YOU, MATE.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.500
YOU DID A FABULOUS JOB.

22:12.500 --> 22:12.875
AHH. I KNOW.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.625
RIGHT.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.583
HEY!

22:22.583 --> 22:24.333
HEY.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.583
SO AREN'T YOU
GONNA SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT MY PERFORMANCE?

22:28.834 --> 22:30.667
YEAH, YOU WERE--
YOU WERE GREAT.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.583
YOU'RE ALWAYS GREAT.

22:32.583 --> 22:33.500
YOU'RE A--

22:33.500 --> 22:34.125
A REAL ACTRESS,
NATASHA.

22:34.125 --> 22:36.500
YEAH, I WAS JUST OK,

22:36.500 --> 22:38.417
BUT ISN'T MAX AMAZING?

22:38.417 --> 22:39.834
YEAH,
HE'S REALLY GOOD.

22:39.834 --> 22:43.375
UM, SO, LISTEN,
I KNOW WE HAD PLANS
TO HANG OUT TONIGHT,

22:43.375 --> 22:45.250
BUT MAX SORTA ASKED ME
TO HAVE A DRINK.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.041
YOU KNOW,
KIND OF A GOOD-BYE,

22:47.041 --> 22:48.417
NICE-WORKIN'-WITH-YA
SORTA THING.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.208
YOU CAN TOTALLY COME
IF YOU WANT TO.

22:50.208 --> 22:51.583
YOU KNOW WHAT
I JUST REMEMBERED?

22:51.583 --> 22:53.834
UH, TODD WANTED TO GO OVER
THE SHOT LIST FOR TOMORROW.

22:53.834 --> 22:56.917
OK, BUT MAYBE I
COULD COME BY LATER...

22:56.917 --> 22:58.208
AFTER I GET BACK?

22:58.208 --> 23:00.166
YEAH, SURE.

23:00.166 --> 23:02.417
GREAT. BYE.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.375
(LAUGHS)
OH, MY GOD.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.834
YOU HAVE TO TRY
ONE OF THESE PIGGETY
BLANKETY THINGIES,

23:17.834 --> 23:19.083
THEY'RE AMAZING!

23:19.083 --> 23:21.083
YOU OBVIOUSLY
WEREN'T RAISED ON 'EM
LIKE I WAS.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.625
WHAT?

23:24.625 --> 23:27.542
DIDN'T YOU SPECIALIZE
IN HAUTE CUISINE

23:27.542 --> 23:28.834
OR SOME SUCH NONSENSE

23:28.834 --> 23:30.458
BEFORE YOU BECAME
A RAGING SELLOUT?

23:30.458 --> 23:32.375
YOUR POINT BEING?

23:32.375 --> 23:35.542
YOU CAN JUST
CHOMP THOSE THINGS
DOWN THERE, PACEY.

23:35.542 --> 23:36.875
OH, SURE,
BUT THEN I'D LOSE
THE COMIC EFFECT,

23:36.875 --> 23:37.291
AND IT'D BE
FAR LESS CHARMING.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.583
OH, I SEE.

23:39.583 --> 23:41.250
THIS IS YOUR DATING
SCHTICK, IS IT?

23:41.250 --> 23:43.917
HOW YOU NIBBLE DELICATELY
ON THAT PETITE CORN.

23:43.917 --> 23:44.959
THIS ISN'T WORKIN'
FOR YA?

23:44.959 --> 23:47.417
(LAUGHS)

23:47.417 --> 23:48.417
VERY DAINTY.

23:48.417 --> 23:50.041
OK, NOW, ADMIT IT.
YOU ARE HAVING FUN.

23:50.041 --> 23:51.041
OH, I ADMIT NOTHING,

23:51.041 --> 23:52.250
I AM SIMPLY GIDDY
ON ALL THE FREE FOOD.

23:52.250 --> 23:55.417
AND YOUR CHARMING
AND CHIVALROUS DATE,
OF COURSE.

23:55.417 --> 23:57.583
AH, DON'T GET ANY IDEAS
ON ME, PACEY.

23:57.583 --> 23:59.583
OH, I'M NOT.
I'M JUST SAYIN'.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.792
HEY, EMMA, RIGHT?

24:01.792 --> 24:04.041
THAT IS
A GREAT DRESS.

24:04.041 --> 24:05.166
THANK YOU.

24:05.166 --> 24:08.291
IT'S JUST
SO STYLISH AND UNIQUE,

24:08.291 --> 24:09.750
WHAT--WITH WHAT YOU DID
WITH ALL THE PINS.

24:09.750 --> 24:13.917
OH, I SEE. YOU'RE TAKING
THE PISS, AREN'T YOU?

24:13.917 --> 24:15.291
I'M SORRY?

24:15.291 --> 24:16.083
TAKING THE PISS.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.125
HAVING A LAUGH
AT MY EXPENSE

24:18.125 --> 24:19.291
'CAUSE YOU THINK
MY DRESS IS STUPID

24:19.291 --> 24:20.625
AND YOU'RE
A SMALL-MINDED JERK

24:20.625 --> 24:21.959
WHO'S NO DOUBT...

24:21.959 --> 24:22.917
SMALL IN OTHER AREAS
AS WELL.

24:22.917 --> 24:25.291
(LAUGHS)

24:25.291 --> 24:27.083
EMMA, DO YOU
WANT TO GO USE
THE DANCE FLOOR?

24:27.083 --> 24:28.792
WOW. SHE DANCES, TOO.

24:28.792 --> 24:31.333
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
A MEMBER OF FAIGAN'S GANG,
AREN'T YOU?

24:31.333 --> 24:33.959
HOW DELIGHTFULLY
CONDESCENDING OF YOU, DICK.

24:33.959 --> 24:35.500
RICH.
I KNOW. NOW,

24:35.500 --> 24:36.708
TELL ME, WHEN YOU
WOKE UP THIS MORNING

24:36.708 --> 24:38.708
AND PICKED YOUR LITTLE OUTFIT,
DID YOU THINK, "HMM,

24:38.708 --> 24:41.917
I WANT TO LOOK LIKE
A MONEY-GRUBBING SCHMUCK
WITH NO IMAGINATION,"

24:41.917 --> 24:43.291
OR IS THAT
JUST A HAPPY ACCIDENT?

24:43.291 --> 24:44.166
WELL,
THAT'S ONE OF LIFE'S
LITTLE MYSTERIES

24:44.166 --> 24:45.375
WE'RE JUST NOT
GONNA SOLVE TONIGHT,

24:45.375 --> 24:46.208
SO, SHALL WE?

24:46.208 --> 24:47.250
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT,
WITTER.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.083
YOUR SPECIAL FRIEND
HERE IS DOING

24:49.083 --> 24:50.458
(BRITISH ACCENT)
A SPLENDID JOB

24:50.458 --> 24:52.000
RUINING YOUR IMAGE
ALL BY HERSELF.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.959
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:53.959 --> 24:56.291
I'M GOING
TO GO TO THE LOO

24:56.291 --> 24:58.250
BEFORE I SAY SOMETHING
PACEY REGRETS.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.166
OH, OH, OH, WITTER.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.708
SO I'VE BEEN THINKING...

25:23.708 --> 25:24.750
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

25:24.750 --> 25:27.291
I MEAN, ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS TALK TO HETSON,

25:27.291 --> 25:30.125
REASON WITH HIM.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.875
I'M SURE--I'M SURE
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

25:31.875 --> 25:32.792
I TRIED, ACTUALLY.

25:32.792 --> 25:36.208
UM...SURPRISINGLY,
HE DOESN'T CARE.

25:37.708 --> 25:39.375
THAT'S IT.

25:39.375 --> 25:41.834
I'M GONNA LOSE
MY SCHOLARSHIP.

25:41.834 --> 25:42.750
IT'S OVER.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.917
WELL, LET'S NOT
GET MELODRAMATIC.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.375
MELODRAMATIC?

25:46.375 --> 25:48.625
I'M--I'M JUST SAYING
RELAX, YOU KNOW?

25:48.625 --> 25:52.208
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE HAVING
A LITTLE WORST-CASE-SCENARIO
FREAK-OUT HERE.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.875
MAYBE YOU'RE FORGETTING
THE BIGGER THINGS AT HAND.

25:53.875 --> 25:56.583
OH, WHAT EXACTLY IS BIGGER
THAN MY GETTING KICKED OUT
OF COLLEGE?

25:56.583 --> 25:59.000
YOU SEE?
YOU'VE ALREADY ESCALATED
FROM LOSING YOUR SCHOLARSHIP

25:59.000 --> 26:00.583
TO GETTING KICKED
OUT OF SCHOOL.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.708
YOU JUST TAKE ALL THIS STUFF
WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.

26:02.708 --> 26:03.708
OH, AND I GUESS
WHAT I'M LEARNING
ABOUT YOU IS

26:03.708 --> 26:05.708
THAT YOU DON'T TAKE
ANYTHING SERIOUSLY.

26:05.708 --> 26:08.375
NO, I JUST TRY
TO PAY ATTENTION
TO THE THINGS THAT MATTER.

26:08.375 --> 26:09.834
AND WHAT MATTERS
TO YOU, EDDIE,

26:09.834 --> 26:11.542
BECAUSE TO ME,
WORTHINGTON IS
KIND OF A RIDE

26:11.542 --> 26:13.750
OUT OF A PREVIOUSLY
LACKING EXISTENCE!

26:13.750 --> 26:16.291
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR DREAMS ARE,

26:16.291 --> 26:18.333
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. IT--

26:19.792 --> 26:21.208
YOU KNOW,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

26:21.208 --> 26:23.250
I DON'T
REALLY KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU AT ALL.

26:23.250 --> 26:27.208
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE USUALLY PRETTY GOOD
AT ASSUMING THINGS ABOUT ME.

26:27.208 --> 26:28.750
YEAH. EVERYTHING
I THINK ABOUT YOU,

26:28.750 --> 26:30.959
I'VE PRETTY MUCH
STRUNG TOGETHER THROUGH
FLIMSY ASSUMPTIONS.

26:30.959 --> 26:33.500
WELL, MAYBE
YOUR POWERS OF DEDUCTION
ARE PARTICULARLY STRONG.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.708
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE
I SHOULD HAVE JUST STUCK
TO MY ORIGINAL PATTERN.

26:36.708 --> 26:38.083
OH, YEAH, BECAUSE THAT
WAS MAKING YOU SO HAPPY.

26:38.083 --> 26:40.708
WELL, AT LEAST I KNEW
WHAT I WAS GETTING
MYSELF INTO.

26:40.708 --> 26:44.083
EVERYTHING NEW I TRY
JUST SEEMS TO BACKFIRE.

26:44.083 --> 26:46.250
THAT'S HOW
PEOPLE GROW UP, JO.

26:46.250 --> 26:47.875
THEY LEARN
FROM THEIR MISTAKES.

26:47.875 --> 26:52.417
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS
WHAT I'M LEARNING IS

26:52.417 --> 26:55.333
THAT AVOIDING
JOEY POTTER'S
PATH LESS TAKEN

26:55.333 --> 26:56.792
IS PROBABLY
THE SMARTER WAY TO GO.

26:59.542 --> 27:01.083
LOOK...

27:01.083 --> 27:04.291
I'M SORRY YOU MISSED
YOUR TEST...

27:04.291 --> 27:09.417
BUT I DON'T WANT
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT
TO BE A MISTAKE TO YOU.

27:15.125 --> 27:16.125
BUT I GUESS IT WAS.

27:25.959 --> 27:27.625
I GOT THIS ONE
IN THE BAG.

27:27.625 --> 27:29.542
I DON'T KNOW.

27:29.542 --> 27:30.625
I'M LOOKIN'
PRETTY HOT TONIGHT.

27:30.625 --> 27:34.583
HEY, HOW ABOUT
THAT PUNK FREAK?

27:34.583 --> 27:35.834
WHAT IS SHE
EVEN DOING HERE?

27:35.834 --> 27:39.667
I DON'T KNOW. DID YOU
GET A LOAD OF HER ACCENT?

27:39.667 --> 27:40.959
IT'S TOTALLY FAKE.

27:40.959 --> 27:44.250
I KNOW, AND I HEARD
SHE WAS REALLY RUDE TO RICH.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.834
WHY SHOULDN'T I BE?
HE'S A LITTLE WANKER.

27:47.834 --> 27:51.000
YEAH, BUT DON'T
YOU WANT TO WIN?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.333
WIN WHAT?

27:52.333 --> 27:55.000
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS PARTY'S
REALLY ABOUT?

27:55.000 --> 27:58.125
I'M SORRY.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

27:58.125 --> 27:59.333
IT'S A CONTEST.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.458
THE GUY WITH THE HOTTEST
DATE WINS 1,000 BUCKS.

28:15.667 --> 28:17.917
WHERE'S YOUR SASSY
PSEUDO-PUNK, WITTER?

28:17.917 --> 28:19.333
I WAS HOPING
FOR ANOTHER ROUND.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.250
WELL, SURPRISINGLY,
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

28:22.250 --> 28:23.625
AND I CAN'T SAY
THAT I REALLY BLAME HER.

28:23.625 --> 28:26.792
THEN WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
WOLFING DOWN THE EMPAÑADAS
ALL NIGHT?

28:26.792 --> 28:29.667
THE WAY YOU TREATED HER
WAS UNNECESSARY, RICH.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.625
EMMA'S NOT THE GIRL
WHO'S GONNA PLAY DOWN

28:31.625 --> 28:34.041
TO YOUR
OUTDATED STEREOTYPE
OF THE LESSER SEX.

28:34.041 --> 28:36.542
IN FACT,
SHE'S PROBABLY
THE MOST ELOQUENT

28:36.542 --> 28:39.041
AND PASSIONATE PERSON
I'VE MET IN A LONG,
LONG TIME,

28:39.041 --> 28:40.333
AND SHE HAS
FAR TOO MUCH GRACE

28:40.333 --> 28:41.667
TO BE LOWERING HERSELF
TO YOUR PLAYING FIELD.

28:41.667 --> 28:44.291
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, WITTER.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.500
I'M SORRY
YOUR POIGNANT OUTBURST
WAS WASTED ON ME.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.542
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.458
I'VE WASTED THE BETTER
PART OF MY EVENING

28:49.458 --> 28:51.166
PLAYING
THIS PATHETIC GAME.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.750
IF YOU CONSIDER THIS
SUCH A WASTE OF YOUR TIME,

28:52.750 --> 28:55.625
WE COULD REMEDY THAT
COME MONDAY MORNING.

28:55.625 --> 28:59.708
IT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,
THIS BACK AND FORTH,

28:59.708 --> 29:01.333
BUT WHAT YOU SEEM
TO HAVE FORGOTTEN

29:01.333 --> 29:03.542
OR WHAT YOU ACTUALLY
NEVER LEARNED

29:03.542 --> 29:05.375
IS THAT I'M YOUR BOSS.

29:05.375 --> 29:09.333
YOU'RE NOT PRECIOUS TO ME.
IN FACT, YOU'RE ON THIN ICE.

29:09.333 --> 29:10.583
YOU WATCH IT
WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR
MOUTH UP TO ME, WITTER.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.875
I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND.

29:12.875 --> 29:15.125
I'M THE GUY WHO'S
IN CHARGE OF YOUR FUTURE,

29:15.125 --> 29:20.500
WHICH IS CURRENTLY BLEAK.

29:23.750 --> 29:26.917
SO WE'LL--THEN
WE'LL DO THAT BIT WHERE
SHE'S IN THE SHOWER.

29:26.917 --> 29:28.375
AND THEN WE'RE DONE.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.583
COOL.

29:30.583 --> 29:32.542
SO SPEAKING OF,
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
LOVEBIRDS UP TO TONIGHT?

29:32.542 --> 29:35.250
NOTHING. NOTHING.

29:35.250 --> 29:38.917
SHE'S, UH--SHE'S OUT...

29:38.917 --> 29:40.708
WITH MAX.

29:40.708 --> 29:41.417
I SEE.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.959
AND SO YOU'RE...

29:43.959 --> 29:46.750
SITTING HERE
THINKING OF WAYS
I COULD KILL HIM.

29:46.750 --> 29:49.083
PRODUCTIVE.

29:49.083 --> 29:51.625
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING, TODD.

29:51.625 --> 29:55.625
THIS ISN'T LIKE ME.
I...

29:55.625 --> 29:56.750
SHE LIED ABOUT
OUR RELATIONSHIP,

29:56.750 --> 29:58.583
AND I HEARD HER
ON THE HEADPHONES.

29:58.583 --> 30:01.291
I HAD A CHANCE
TO CONFRONT HER
ABOUT IT, AND I DIDN'T.

30:01.291 --> 30:04.125
AND NOW SHE'S OUT WITH HIM.
SHE'S ACTUALLY OUT WITH HIM
RIGHT NOW,

30:04.125 --> 30:05.667
AND I DIDN'T SAY A WORD
ABOUT IT.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.333
SO WHAT
THE HELL AM I DOING?

30:09.333 --> 30:10.333
YOU'RE DOING
WHAT'S SMART.

30:10.333 --> 30:12.208
LOOK...

30:12.208 --> 30:13.875
IF YOU CONFRONT HER
ON A LITTLE WHITE LIE,

30:13.875 --> 30:17.083
THE LIKELIHOOD IS
SHE'LL GET MIGHTY UPSET

30:17.083 --> 30:18.583
THAT YOU
WERE EAVESDROPPING,

30:18.583 --> 30:22.375
AND THAT'S IT
FOR YOU AND YOUR
SHAGGING PRIVILEGES

30:22.375 --> 30:22.917
FOR THE REST
OF THE SHOOT.

30:22.917 --> 30:24.959
I SAY IGNORE IT.

30:24.959 --> 30:27.125
I SAY IGNORE IT
AND JUST TRY AND ENJOY

30:27.125 --> 30:29.500
THE REST OF THE TIME
YOU HAVE TOGETHER.

30:30.875 --> 30:36.000
LOOK, YOU MAY VERY WELL BE
THE LOVE OF NATASHA'S LIFE.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.291
BUT SADLY, YOU DON'T AFFECT
HER NEXT MOVIE OFFER,

30:39.291 --> 30:40.792
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

30:40.792 --> 30:44.959
SO I SAY
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

30:44.959 --> 30:46.583
NO BIG THING.

30:46.583 --> 30:49.917
SO THAT'S YOUR ADVICE?
JUST SWEEP IT UNDER THE RUG
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED?

30:49.917 --> 30:52.083
YEAH, THAT IS MY ADVICE,
YOU CHEEKY BUGGER.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.333
THAT'S TERRIBLE ADVICE.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.291
AND YET GOOD ADVICE

30:54.291 --> 30:55.750
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP
SHAGGING NATASHA.

30:55.750 --> 30:56.917
ARRGH!

30:56.917 --> 30:58.083
I WISH SHE DIDN'T HAVE
THIS POWER OVER ME.

30:58.083 --> 31:02.291
IT'S LIKE--SOMETIMES
I LOOK AT HER AND I...

31:02.291 --> 31:04.208
I FORGET MY OWN NAME.
IT'S LIKE ALL I CAN
THINK ABOUT IS--

31:04.208 --> 31:05.417
SEX?

31:08.333 --> 31:09.834
YEAH.
YOU SEE?

31:09.834 --> 31:11.667
AND THEY KNOW THAT.

31:11.667 --> 31:13.667
AND THAT'S HOW THEY
WALK ALL OVER US.

31:13.667 --> 31:17.041
TECHNICALLY, ISN'T IT YOU
THAT DOES THE WALKING ALL OVER
IN THESE SITUATIONS?

31:17.041 --> 31:18.667
OH, I'VE BEEN TROD UPON.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.000
BELIEVE YOU ME.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.583
DON'T EVEN
GET ME STARTED.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.291
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA
BE DIRECT WITH HER.

31:28.291 --> 31:30.208
I CAN'T--I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE MYSELF CRAZY OVER THIS.

31:30.208 --> 31:31.500
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST
WITH PEOPLE.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.875
YEAH. LET ME KNOW
HOW THAT WORKS OUT
FOR YOU.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.542
I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

31:36.542 --> 31:38.000
RIGHT. WHY THINK
WHEN WE CAN DRINK?

31:38.000 --> 31:41.959
UH, BARKEEP,
2 SHOTS OF WHISKEY,

31:41.959 --> 31:45.291
AND BRING DAWSON
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.417
CAN I TAKE YOUR ORDER?

32:01.417 --> 32:04.000
I'LL TAKE A BURGER
AND A BEER--A GUINNESS,
PLEASE.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.291
AND I'D LIKE A PICKLE
ON THE SIDE, PLEASE,

32:06.291 --> 32:09.583
AND A GLASS OF WATER,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
WITH ICE--

32:09.583 --> 32:11.166
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

32:11.166 --> 32:13.083
SURE.

32:13.083 --> 32:15.792
HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE
AND ORDER FROM ME

32:15.792 --> 32:17.041
AND PRETEND
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED?

32:17.041 --> 32:18.583
WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

32:18.583 --> 32:20.625
ARE YOU--ARE YOU TRYING
TO TORTURE ME? IS THAT IT?

32:20.625 --> 32:22.917
OH, FIRST OF ALL,
THAT WAS, LIKE,
4 QUESTIONS,

32:22.917 --> 32:24.291
BUT NO MATTER.

32:24.291 --> 32:25.583
THE ANSWER
TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION,
HOW CAN I JUST SIT HERE

32:25.583 --> 32:28.667
AND ORDER FROM YOU
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED
IS TWOFOLD.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.792
A--FROM MY PERSPECTIVE,
NOT MUCH REALLY DID
HAPPEN.

32:30.792 --> 32:34.458
AND B--I'M HUNGRY.

32:34.458 --> 32:35.834
IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO ME
THAT IT HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

32:35.834 --> 32:37.250
NO, JUST
MY PALTRY LITTLE LIFE

32:37.250 --> 32:40.875
WHICH HAS COME CRASHING DOWN
ALL AROUND ME, THANKS TO YOU.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.291
THANKS TO WHO NOW?

32:43.834 --> 32:46.375
HEY, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, JOEY.

32:46.375 --> 32:47.917
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:47.917 --> 32:50.792
I CHANGED MY MIND.

32:50.792 --> 32:53.417
I DON'T WANT
FRENCH FRIES. I REALLY
FEEL LIKE ONION RINGS.

33:00.583 --> 33:02.166
PROFESSOR HETSON.

33:02.166 --> 33:05.208
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.
OK, NOW, LET ME GUESS.

33:05.208 --> 33:06.792
UH, YOU'RE THE KNIGHT
IN SHINING ARMOR,

33:06.792 --> 33:09.250
AND I'M THE EVIL DRAGON
IN THIS LITTLE PLAY
WE SEEM TO BE DOING.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.125
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER
ANOTHER CHANCE.

33:11.125 --> 33:14.458
IT WASN'T HER FAULT.
IT WAS MY FAULT.

33:14.458 --> 33:15.583
I MADE HER LATE
FOR THE TEST.

33:15.583 --> 33:19.125
LOOK, EDDIE,
IF THAT EVEN
IS YOUR REAL NAME,

33:19.125 --> 33:20.083
I DON'T CARE.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.208
I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH SHE STUDIED.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.542
I DON'T CARE
HOW SORRY SHE IS.

33:23.542 --> 33:25.041
I DON'T CARE
HOW GREAT THE SEX WAS.

33:25.041 --> 33:27.083
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR BREATH, KID.

33:27.083 --> 33:28.750
GO GET A KITTEN OUT
OF A TREE OR SOMETHING.

33:28.750 --> 33:31.250
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, MAN?

33:31.250 --> 33:34.500
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU TRY
TO BE HUMAN FOR ONCE?

33:34.500 --> 33:39.917
TELL ME,
JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK
THIS LITTLE RELATIONSHIP

33:39.917 --> 33:41.500
WITH YOU AND JOEY
IS GOING, ANYWAY?

33:41.500 --> 33:43.375
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

33:43.375 --> 33:46.333
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

33:46.333 --> 33:49.041
AND BELIEVE ME, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE A PRETTY PICTURE.

33:49.041 --> 33:53.417
MS. POTTER IS--WELL,
HER PERFORMANCE ON TODAY'S
EXAM NOTWITHSTANDING--

33:53.417 --> 33:55.875
A GAL WHO'S GOING
PLACES, AS THEY SAY,

33:55.875 --> 33:58.917
PLACES THAT YOU WILL
NOT BE GOING, EDDIE.

33:58.917 --> 34:01.333
PLACES YOU CAN
NEVER HOPE TO GO.

34:01.333 --> 34:05.208
DON'T TELL ME
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
JUST A LITTLE CRAZY

34:05.208 --> 34:06.708
KNOWING THAT SHE'S
ACTUALLY GOT THE LIFE

34:06.708 --> 34:08.542
THAT YOU TRIED
TO FAKE FOR YOURSELF.

34:08.542 --> 34:10.833
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

34:10.833 --> 34:13.083
MAYBE YOU LURED HER
TO YOUR APARTMENT
ON PURPOSE, RIGHT?

34:13.083 --> 34:14.958
TRIED TO LEVEL THE
PLAYING FIELD, MAYBE?

34:14.958 --> 34:18.000
NOT GONNA WORK,
THOUGH, EDDIE.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.166
SHE'LL STILL
SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

34:20.166 --> 34:21.500
SHE'LL STILL LEAVE,

34:21.500 --> 34:23.958
AND YOU'LL STILL BE
TRAPPED RIGHT HERE.

34:25.750 --> 34:27.542
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING
YOU LOOK SO CUTE

34:27.542 --> 34:29.208
IN THAT LITTLE APRON
OF YOURS, 'CAUSE--

34:46.750 --> 34:48.833
(SLAMS TRAY DOWN)

35:04.959 --> 35:05.959
HEY.

35:05.959 --> 35:06.917
HEY.

35:06.917 --> 35:08.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:08.792 --> 35:11.917
SITTING HERE
WAITING FOR YOU.

35:11.917 --> 35:13.458
OH.

35:16.834 --> 35:17.834
WELL...

35:19.750 --> 35:21.625
I JUST
GOT FIRED.

35:24.417 --> 35:25.250
I'M SORRY.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.959
WELL, HETSON
AGREED NOT TO SUE,

35:26.959 --> 35:31.500
SO, NO,
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.583
EDDIE, LOOK, I AM...
SO SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

35:35.583 --> 35:36.875
JOEY, JOEY--
NO, IT'S JUST THAT--

35:36.875 --> 35:39.166
I TEND TO--NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

35:39.166 --> 35:42.000
I UNDERSTAND.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.166
AND I'M SORRY
I CALLED YOU
MELODRAMATIC.

35:45.166 --> 35:47.792
WELL...

35:47.792 --> 35:49.250
I DO TEND
TO ESCALATE THINGS,

35:49.250 --> 35:52.291
AND YOU DO TEND
TO DOWNPLAY THEM.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.458
BUT...

35:54.458 --> 35:57.959
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE,
SOMETHING ABOUT US
STILL MAKES SENSE.

35:59.667 --> 36:03.625
IF I HADN'T OVERSLEPT
AND MESSED THINGS UP
WITH HETSON,

36:03.625 --> 36:07.333
I NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN
THIS NEW SIDE OF YOU.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.917
SO THE POTTER PATH
LESS TRAVELED,

36:09.917 --> 36:14.083
NOT SO BAD?

36:14.083 --> 36:19.333
A ROCKY START, MAYBE,
BUT IT'S KIND OF NICE HERE.

36:19.333 --> 36:22.291
YOU GOT A GREAT
RIGHT HOOK THERE, SLUGGER.

36:32.083 --> 36:34.333
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

36:34.333 --> 36:36.000
FOR CALLING ME SLUGGER.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.542
I KINDA LIKED IT.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.000
HEY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA--

36:43.000 --> 36:46.917
SOMETHING WE CAN DO
TO TAKE OUR MINDS
OFF ALL THIS.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.500
NO.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.792
NOT THAT, DIRTY GIRL.

36:50.792 --> 36:54.583
SOMETHING ELSE
TO TAKE OUR MINDS
OFF ALL THIS. COME ON.

37:05.041 --> 37:08.166
(LAUGHING)

37:08.166 --> 37:09.834
Max: ...SO GOOD.

37:09.834 --> 37:13.041
Natasha: OH, MAX.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.875
OH, MY GOD. I LOVE HER.

37:14.875 --> 37:18.000
SHE'S GOT 1/16 OF
THE SEXUAL PRESENCE
THAT YOU HAVE.

37:28.708 --> 37:30.333
HEY, MAN.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.750
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

37:59.583 --> 38:02.166
HEY, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
HERE. I MISSED YOU.

38:02.166 --> 38:03.417
YEAH.

38:05.792 --> 38:07.208
YOU HAVE FUN?

38:07.208 --> 38:09.417
IT WAS KIND OF BORING.

38:09.417 --> 38:12.708
WE HAD A DRINK,
AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING TV
IN MY ROOM EVER SINCE.

38:14.458 --> 38:18.875
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU ALL NIGHT.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.750
DAWSON, COME ON.

38:31.750 --> 38:35.625
I'M STANDING
IN FRONT OF YOU
ASKING TO COME IN.

38:35.625 --> 38:36.750
ARE YOU HONESTLY
GONNA SEND ME OUT

38:36.750 --> 38:40.500
INTO THE COLD, COLD
NIGHT ALL BY MYSELF?

39:03.959 --> 39:05.250
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

39:05.250 --> 39:07.166
I LEFT.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.542
I NOTICED THAT.

39:08.542 --> 39:10.875
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE
OR LETTING ME KNOW.

39:13.333 --> 39:15.458
LOOK,
IF THIS IS ABOUT RICH,

39:15.458 --> 39:16.250
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
PAY THAT GUY ANY MIND.

39:16.250 --> 39:17.458
HE'S JUST A MORON.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.083
EMMA.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.667
SO DID I WIN, THEN?

39:30.667 --> 39:32.125
WHAT?

39:32.125 --> 39:34.000
I SAID,
DID I WIN, THEN?

39:34.000 --> 39:35.125
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

39:35.125 --> 39:36.625
YEAH, PROBABLY NOT.

39:36.625 --> 39:40.125
THERE WAS, LIKE,
20 GIRLS THERE THAT WERE
WAY HOTTER THAN ME, RIGHT?

39:40.125 --> 39:41.333
SOMEBODY TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE CONTEST.

39:41.333 --> 39:45.708
PRETTY SHARP THERE,
PACEY.

39:45.708 --> 39:48.458
ALL I CAN SAY
IS THAT I'M SORRY.

39:48.458 --> 39:50.834
THERE'S NO NOBLE SPEECH
I CAN GIVE YOU.

39:50.834 --> 39:56.667
I JUST
SCREWED UP ROYALLY,
AND I APOLOGIZE.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.291
I TOOK THE SPINELESS,
CORPORATE ROUTE,

39:58.291 --> 40:00.583
AND...SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE LINE,

40:00.583 --> 40:01.458
I GUESS I JUST FORGOT
THAT I HAD A CHOICE.

40:01.458 --> 40:04.125
YOU ALWAYS
HAVE A CHOICE, PACEY.

40:04.125 --> 40:05.417
TRUE ENOUGH,

40:05.417 --> 40:08.375
THOUGH IN THAT OFFICE,
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
FEEL LIKE IT.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.625
SO DID I WIN, THEN?

40:13.000 --> 40:16.375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU EVEN TAKE ME THERE,
PACEY.

40:16.375 --> 40:18.375
YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT THAT CONTEST WAS ABOUT.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.750
WERE YOU TRYING
TO HUMILIATE ME OR--

40:20.750 --> 40:23.750
NO, GOD! NO, EMMA,
I TOOK YOU TO THAT THING

40:23.750 --> 40:25.083
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD WIN.

40:25.083 --> 40:27.792
YOU WERE BY FAR
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
IN THAT ROOM,

40:27.792 --> 40:29.583
AND I'M NOT
TAKING A PISS
OR WHATEVER IT IS

40:29.583 --> 40:32.083
YOU CRAZY
ENGLISH PEOPLE SAY.

40:32.083 --> 40:33.792
YOU'RE NOT?

40:33.792 --> 40:35.083
NO, NOT AT ALL.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.875
JUST FOR ME
TO BE THERE WITH YOU
WAS 10 TIMES THE PRIZE

40:37.875 --> 40:39.708
I WAS EVER
GONNA GET FROM THOSE...

40:39.708 --> 40:42.250
SOULLESS
CORPORATE FREAKS
THAT I WORK WITH.

40:42.250 --> 40:45.625
SO I AM--I'M SORRY.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.083
(KEY RATTLING)

41:01.792 --> 41:03.166
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, JACK.

41:07.208 --> 41:09.041
SEEN THE REMOTE?

41:09.041 --> 41:10.625
HERE.

41:10.625 --> 41:12.625
OH, THANKS.

41:22.834 --> 41:25.750
WHAT'S GOING ON, EDDIE?

41:25.750 --> 41:28.083
I'M STARTING
TO GET A LITTLE FREAKED.

41:52.625 --> 41:58.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR DAD
GOT US HERE LIKE THIS.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.417
THIS IS SO COOL.

41:59.417 --> 42:01.333
OH, THE DOLINGS
HAVE CONNECTIONS.

42:01.333 --> 42:04.208
IRISH MAFIA--I KNEW IT.

42:04.208 --> 42:05.750
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT ELSE?

42:05.750 --> 42:06.750
WHAT ELSE?

42:06.750 --> 42:10.291
YOU DO POSSESS
A CERTAIN MASCULINE GRACE.

42:10.291 --> 42:12.500
YES, I TOLD YOU.

42:13.166 --> 42:15.208
VERY NICE.
YES.

42:15.208 --> 42:20.166
COME HERE. COME HERE.

42:20.166 --> 42:22.542
THANK YOU FOR THIS...

42:22.542 --> 42:24.208
FOR EVERYTHING.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.834
IT'S MY PLEASURE,
JOEY POTTER.

42:37.333 --> 42:39.542
Joey:
COME ON!

42:39.542 --> 42:42.291
Eddie: OK.

42:42.291 --> 42:43.166
Eddie: OK,
SKATE BACKWARDS
NOW.

42:43.166 --> 42:44.417
BACKWARDS?
YES.

42:44.417 --> 42:46.291
NO, THAT'S
FORWARDS.

42:46.291 --> 42:47.708
THAT'S MY SPIN.
