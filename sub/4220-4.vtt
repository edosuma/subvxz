WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.920
Boden and I have been
talking about making you
our candidate.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.004
Yeah! Yes!

00:05.089 --> 00:07.507
Welcome to Truck 81, baby!

00:09.593 --> 00:11.386
Mills! Mills! Hey!

00:11.595 --> 00:13.179
I can't clear you
for squad duty.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.264
If Dawson's moving
over to truck,

00:15.349 --> 00:16.849
means there's an opening
for a paramedic.

00:16.934 --> 00:17.934
Correct.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.144
I ordered some drinks!
Where are the drinks?

00:20.229 --> 00:21.229
I think you had enough.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.730
And all of a sudden
it's an intervention?

00:22.815 --> 00:24.816
You do know that there
is grief counseling
available?

00:24.942 --> 00:26.025
I'm good.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.362
Ready, go.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.406
Go, go, go, go, go,

00:31.490 --> 00:32.532
go, go, go, go, go.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.786
Ah, I kicked your ass!
I kicked your ass!

00:38.455 --> 00:40.581
Yeah! Thank you, Mick.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.084
Put this down towards
a round for everyone.

00:45.629 --> 00:46.921
Yeah, all right, all right.

00:48.132 --> 00:49.132
Oh.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.260
Come on, Kelly,
you got to take it outside.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.095
Who you talkin' 'bout?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.888
All the money
I put away here,

00:55.973 --> 00:57.765
I can't enjoy one smoke?
Take it up with the mayor.

00:58.642 --> 00:59.684
All right, maybe I will...

01:01.395 --> 01:02.729
Take it up with the mayor.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.235
You are
six Irish car bombs in.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.821
When I buy
that ride of yours,
I want it in one piece.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.323
You're a real pal, Mick.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.006
Blue line
train to Forest Park.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.175
Next stop, Madison.
Watch the closing doors.

01:47.316 --> 01:48.608
All right, dinner options,

01:48.692 --> 01:50.276
Greek or Italian?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.611
Barely engaged,

01:51.695 --> 01:53.404
and she's already trying
to lose the ring.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.114
Uh, it's better
than realizing

01:55.199 --> 01:57.408
it's stuck on there
before roll call tomorrow.

01:57.493 --> 01:58.785
We got tools for that.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.995
Don't even joke.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.207
I already feel like
I'm under the microscope.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.044
Because you are.
Like any candidate should be
on their first day.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.463
Whoa!
That being said,

02:11.632 --> 02:13.174
you're gonna
kick ass tomorrow.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.510
Thanks.

02:16.470 --> 02:21.057
But is that my lieutenant
or fiancÃ© talking?

02:22.267 --> 02:24.852
Well, uh, you're my
candidate at work,

02:24.937 --> 02:27.814
but at home
I'm all yours.

02:28.273 --> 02:33.986
Hmm. Then it wouldn't
be insubordination if
I were to say...

02:36.114 --> 02:37.406
Thai food.

02:52.548 --> 02:53.881
Somebody's shooting!

02:55.634 --> 02:56.676
Out of the way!

03:20.117 --> 03:22.910
Why'd you do that?
I told you to stay put!

03:25.497 --> 03:27.456
Sir, you need
to go back. Go back now!

03:27.541 --> 03:28.541
You ain't going nowhere.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.973
Ma'am,
just put pressure on it.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.474
You talk to me,
not her!

03:46.018 --> 03:48.060
Okay, relax.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.812
You're the man in charge.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.398
This is just her own
damn fault, all right,

03:52.482 --> 03:54.150
trying to stop me
from doing my business.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.819
You did what you
came here to do.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.529
Nothing's holding you here.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.780
It ain't that simple.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.408
Boy, why don't you
listen to the man?

04:03.327 --> 04:05.494
You don't get it.
You already
seen too much!

04:25.307 --> 04:27.350
All right, let me see.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.185
Entry is right
below the clavicle.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.188
No exit wound.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.648
How's your breathing?

04:34.024 --> 04:35.858
Okay, good. Uh...

04:36.985 --> 04:38.903
Get this on.
Keep pressure on it.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.989
Forget 911, there's
no reception this
far underground.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.075
I got a radio in my cabin...

04:44.284 --> 04:47.244
Hey, hey, the more
you move, the more
you bleed, okay?

04:47.329 --> 04:48.871
I'll get the radio.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.458
He wasn't alone.
The other one
went in the back.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.043
Just keep pressure on it.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.546
Yeah. This is train, uh...

04:59.424 --> 05:02.385
2509, we have
gunshots fired.
One dead, one wounded.

05:02.469 --> 05:06.055
Copy 2509, units are being
dispatched. Standby.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.224
All right, tell them
to hurry up,

05:08.350 --> 05:10.226
she's losing a lot of blood,
we need paramedics...

05:10.310 --> 05:12.061
Copy that, 2509.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.480
Hey, come on. Come on!

05:20.529 --> 05:21.487
Where's the next platform?

05:21.571 --> 05:22.655
Washington station's

05:22.739 --> 05:24.156
the last one open
this time of night.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.574
Keep movin'.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.201
Is there a closer station?

05:27.285 --> 05:29.412
One, but it's off-line,
no street access.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.914
Hey, you can do this.
Show me, come on.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.839
You can do it,
come on.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.634
Right over there.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.346
So why the hell did
you jump in front of
a bullet?

05:48.890 --> 05:51.017
These gangs been
ruining lives
in my neighborhood

05:51.101 --> 05:52.727
for as long as
I can remember.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.731
Only way to survive is
to keep your head down and
pretend it's not happening.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.816
I just got tired of
pretending.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.067
Yeah.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.111
You're no different.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.321
You ran into my car
like some kind of maniac.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.615
Yeah, well...

06:07.492 --> 06:09.952
You either gotta move
forward or backward, right?

06:10.495 --> 06:11.537
Hmm.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.164
Bullet's close
to your lung.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.751
We're gonna need to seal it
so no air gets in, okay?
Okay.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.713
You're doing great,
you're doing great, okay.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.506
Hold that there,
put pressure on it.

06:22.591 --> 06:23.883
I got it. Okay.
You got it? Hold it there.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.217
Okay?
Mmm-hmm.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.178
Cops aren't gonna know
to look for us here.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.345
I'm gonna try and
make a signal, all right?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.514
You a doctor?
No.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.558
A firefighter.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.436
Maybe you missed
your calling.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.854
My best friend
was a paramedic,

06:36.938 --> 06:38.314
she drilled this
kind of stuff into me.

06:39.483 --> 06:40.649
Amen to her.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.782
Okay.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.993
Okay, there we go.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.329
All right, we just
need enough smoke
to trip this alarm.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.082
The cops will be here
in no time, okay?

06:58.210 --> 07:00.795
Hey! Hey, come on!
Hey, hey, you gotta
stay with me.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.964
Hey, sweetie, you gotta
stay with me, okay?
Hey, come here. Come on.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.549
Well,

07:06.176 --> 07:07.259
look-a here.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.354
Finish this, Andre. Do it.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.234
That ain't gonna help
either one of you, fool.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.988
Come on, man, do it!

07:29.032 --> 07:30.950
They ain't G, man!
They're witnesses.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.493
Andre.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.371
You're the one
with the gun, okay?

07:35.497 --> 07:36.789
You can walk away
from this still.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.209
Stop, stop talking to me,
all right? Stop talking!

07:50.428 --> 07:51.470
Aah!

07:52.848 --> 07:54.723
Give me that gun.
If you don't do it, I will.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.476
Get on your knees.
Drop the gun!

07:57.561 --> 07:58.727
Get down on your knees!
Drop the gun!

07:58.812 --> 08:00.146
Drop that gun!
Get on your knees!

08:00.772 --> 08:02.773
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!

08:02.858 --> 08:04.066
Hey, hey...
Get down!

08:04.192 --> 08:05.901
I need an ambulance
over here, now!

08:06.820 --> 08:08.696
21-13, emergency.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.322
Roll an ambulance
to Belmont station.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.075
We've got a victim with a
gunshot wound to the chest.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.877
Severide.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.671
That fire alarm
was good thinking.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.840
Hey. How about
we give you a ride home?

08:27.966 --> 08:29.842
No, I'm good.
Thanks. I'm...

08:29.926 --> 08:31.760
Actually, we can't
let you go yet.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.262
Not until Homicide
gets your statement.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.696
Three months suspension
from driving
is like a death sentence.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.198
Who doesn't roll
through a light?

08:52.282 --> 08:56.452
Hey. You were cleared
of the wreck. Could have
been worse, huh?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.413
Yeah, says the guy
who gets to drive
while I'm in purgatory.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.749
Yeah, I feel for you,
man. Really, I do.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.920
Oh! What do we
have here?

09:06.296 --> 09:07.296
Is this a new candidate?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.798
She's all yours,
fellas.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.675
I hope you're ready
to finally get your
hands dirty.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.719
Oh, absolutely. Just as soon
as I drop this...

09:13.887 --> 09:15.512
That can wait.

09:16.306 --> 09:20.976
Could you do me a favor and
grab a spanner wrench from
compartment three, would you?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.980
Uh, yeah, okay.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.611
Oh!

09:34.074 --> 09:35.449
Hey, come on.
You're supposed to...

09:35.533 --> 09:37.826
What? Scream like
a 7-year-old, like you did
on your first shift?

09:37.953 --> 09:39.411
That is not
quite what happened.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.496
Yeah, it did.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.249
You wanna prank the new
girl, you better come
at her with more than a...

09:43.333 --> 09:45.834
Is that smack talk coming
from the candidate?

09:46.711 --> 09:49.213
Yeah,
I do believe it is.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.132
Okay, all right,
let's start over, okay?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.718
Um, I'm really happy
to be here

09:54.803 --> 09:57.137
and I know that
I have a lot to learn,

09:57.222 --> 09:59.181
and I do not expect
any special treatment...

09:59.266 --> 10:01.183
Yeah, yeah.
What's in the bag?

10:02.018 --> 10:05.771
Oh, lunch.
It's an old family recipe.
Arroz con pollo...

10:05.855 --> 10:08.315
Don't let it stop you
on your way
to your new workstation.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.485
That would be the kitchen.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.955
So, your EMTP license
is still valid,

10:23.790 --> 10:25.708
and medical's cleared
your request.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.794
So I'm good to go
then, right?
Yeah.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.380
Peter,

10:34.134 --> 10:38.178
this choice that you've
made is commendable.

10:38.263 --> 10:42.599
But I feel compelled to tell
you that other firefighters
have gone down this road

10:43.977 --> 10:45.394
only to find themselves
chasing ghosts.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.396
Yeah, I know what you're
talking about, Chief. I...

10:47.480 --> 10:50.524
I know you've always
felt that firefighting
is your legacy.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.985
What I need right now
is a great paramedic.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.946
Then you have one.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.532
I'm here to do the work.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.411
Good.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.874
Oh, Chief.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.960
Did Lieutenant Severide
mention my situation?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.005
He, uh...

11:14.090 --> 11:16.133
He said that he was gonna
do what he could

11:16.217 --> 11:18.427
to try and find a way
around the situation,

11:18.845 --> 11:20.095
keep me on squad.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.264
No, he did not.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.642
Sorry, Peter.

11:25.935 --> 11:29.104
Kelly Severide doesn't seem
to be in a place where he
can offer much help.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.857
Yeah, of course.

11:33.902 --> 11:34.902
Brett.

11:38.782 --> 11:39.782
Done deal?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.284
It's official.
Two of you are now partners.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.120
Nice! I've never
had a guy before.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.457
Oh, in an... In an ambo.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.877
I mean, as a partner
in an ambo.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.505
Mmm. Mmm-hmm, yeah, we...
We got it.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.345
Hey.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.598
If crashing here is
your way of skipping out
on paying rent then...

12:04.682 --> 12:07.184
No, um, I lost my key.
I didn't want to
wake you guys up.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.563
How'd you get the shiner?
Hit on the wrong woman?

12:12.857 --> 12:13.899
Something like that.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.657
This looks great!

12:21.741 --> 12:22.950
Hey, the green sauce
is for the eggs.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.328
Hey. Uh, I'm looking for
a Sylvie Brett.

12:26.621 --> 12:27.704
Hey, who's this?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.793
Harrison?
Hey, Sylvie.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.922
Guys.
What are you doing here?

12:37.507 --> 12:41.218
Well, truth be told,
I came to apologize.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.930
Maybe we should talk
about this in private?

12:45.014 --> 12:48.016
Nope. This is as good
a place as any.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.394
I blew it.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.606
I looked at
our coming wedding,
and I had doubts about

12:54.691 --> 12:57.443
whether I wanted to
marry the only girl
that I ever loved,

12:57.527 --> 13:00.112
and I let my cold feet
get the best of me.

13:01.656 --> 13:02.865
I'm sorry for that.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.412
And I'm sorry I
called off the wedding
and I want you back.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.165
Please come home.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.459
Wait.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.837
So, like,
in Runaway Bride,
I thought...

13:19.424 --> 13:20.466
Truck 81, Squad 3...

13:20.550 --> 13:21.758
Oh, saved by the bells.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.304
I... I have to go.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.724
Hey, Candidate.
Give 'em hell.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.862
So this Harrison,
he left you?

13:43.114 --> 13:45.991
Um, yeah, I kinda
lied about that.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.680
Over here! Over here!

14:09.974 --> 14:12.684
Tom was prepping an SUV
for the crusher when our
forklift hit the pile.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.228
Whole thing came
crashing down on him.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.105
Help!

14:17.398 --> 14:18.398
He's alive!

14:18.816 --> 14:19.942
The front is slipping,
hold it!

14:20.777 --> 14:22.110
Hold!

14:25.573 --> 14:25.656
Please. Don't let
me die like this.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.950
Please. Don't let
me die like this.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.660
All right. Not gonna
let that happen.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.411
We need struts and
cribbing right now!

14:31.496 --> 14:32.663
On its way.

14:32.747 --> 14:33.914
Let's go!

14:33.998 --> 14:36.041
Herrmann, Dawson reports
directly to you.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.459
Yeah, copy that.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.128
All right, have the bottle
jacks standing by. You're
trained for that, right?

14:40.255 --> 14:42.923
Yeah, at the academy, we...
Yeah, yeah, good.
Go, get on it.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.050
Watch the
front end! Watch it!

14:45.134 --> 14:46.927
Newhouse, I need
a strut on this side!

14:47.011 --> 14:48.887
Hey! Tom! Tom!
Hey, look at me.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.223
We're doing our part,
you do yours.
You stay awake, okay?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.307
Okay. Okay.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.148
God!

15:00.275 --> 15:01.275
Mills!

15:01.651 --> 15:04.027
Yeah? Oh, yeah,
backboard. I got it.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.448
Sorry.
It's okay.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.412
Capp!

15:13.830 --> 15:15.539
Good.
All right, Casey,
cribbing's set.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.748
Let's get this
thing lifted.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.083
Herrmann,
where are my jacks?

15:18.543 --> 15:19.543
Ah...

15:21.254 --> 15:23.380
Jack handles are missing.
They're not where
they're supposed to...

15:23.464 --> 15:24.506
Come on.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.760
I got it.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.846
Capp, get that in there.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.181
With me, Dawson.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.602
Dawson! Halligan.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.855
Back up.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.528
Improvise.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.530
Go.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.203
Dawson, get on the left side.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.291
Watch his head.
Okay, we're doing
this together now.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.376
Ready? Go.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.003
Watch his head, guys.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.133
Stay with me.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.551
How we doing?

16:10.011 --> 16:11.720
- That's it.
- Got it?

16:12.680 --> 16:13.847
All right,
let's board him.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.475
I'll board him.
No, I can slide it
right in...

16:16.559 --> 16:17.726
No, it's too unstable.
We'll bring him to you.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.936
- All right, it's clear.
- Let's get him out.

16:21.898 --> 16:25.275
Easy, easy.
One, two, three, go.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.048
I got twenty on it.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.342
I'm in.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.551
What's the bet?

16:52.428 --> 16:53.845
Pool on how you got
the black eye.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.848
We'd ask if you'd want
in but you probably
remember how you got it.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.600
You do remember, right?

16:59.602 --> 17:00.811
Good luck with that.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.108
Mouch.
How's that eye coming?

17:06.943 --> 17:08.610
Doc said I'll be back
on duty by next shift.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.946
You selling bibles
in the meantime?

17:11.114 --> 17:13.949
Actually, it so happens
the CFD code inspector

17:14.033 --> 17:17.327
is coming by today
to sign off on our
Molly's Two permits.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.412
Mm.

17:18.496 --> 17:21.289
You sure you're ready
for an inspection?
No offense but, uh,

17:21.749 --> 17:23.125
she's still looking
a little rusty.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.961
Uh, I believe
that's called patina.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.464
We checked the regulations,
we gave the kitchen
a good power wash.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.966
She is good to go.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.554
Lieutenant, can I see you
for a second?

17:35.638 --> 17:37.889
Yeah.
Uh, actually, uh,

17:37.974 --> 17:39.891
hey, um,
if you don't mind,
Lieutenant,

17:39.976 --> 17:42.477
I could use Dawson, uh,
to help me offload the rig.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.604
You got it.
Catch me later.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.357
Come on.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.151
Um...

17:51.195 --> 17:54.114
What you're trying to do,
it's not a good idea.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.408
I'm just trying
to apologize for the...

17:56.492 --> 17:58.160
Calling out your mistakes
with the Lieutenant

17:58.244 --> 18:00.370
is not gonna do you
or me any favors.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.792
You see, apologies are
dangerous in a game of inches.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.504
Understood.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.047
All right.

18:16.679 --> 18:17.679
Give me a minute.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.847
Sure.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.390
What's up, Chief?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.810
Hey, you haven't
chased off Dawson
already, have you?

18:23.895 --> 18:27.689
No. Typical rookie jitters,
but we'll iron 'em out.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.483
I have no doubt.
Yeah.

18:30.151 --> 18:35.113
Chris, uh, that lieutenant
position that you
applied for at House 48.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.198
Yeah.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.116
Been filled. I'm sorry.

18:38.701 --> 18:42.704
Ah, that's the second time
this month I got dinged.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.999
Lot of variables involved.
You'll get the call,
be patient.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.503
I got a lot of practice
with patience. Hmm.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.090
Severide.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.218
A word, in my office.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.901
I got a courtesy call
from CPD brass.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.654
Turns out one of my
lieutenants saw

19:15.738 --> 19:17.823
a lot of action on
the L-Train last night.

19:18.866 --> 19:22.577
You know what? You should get
in that black eye pool, I
think they're up to 90 bucks.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.623
I'm fine, Chief.
It's handled.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.543
Oh, like you've been
handling things since
you got back here?

19:30.127 --> 19:32.504
Dragging into my house
right before roll call,

19:32.588 --> 19:34.631
looking like
you got your ass
kicked by a bottle.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.592
Chief, I get the job done.
Day in, day out.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.886
It is not just about
showing up!

19:45.351 --> 19:50.188
Trust me. I know
that losing Shay,
that's hard,

19:52.608 --> 19:55.360
but do you really think
that this is how she would
want you to get past it?

19:55.444 --> 19:56.528
Please don't.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.573
I'm telling you,
I'm fine.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.575
Kelly,

20:04.078 --> 20:05.662
get beyond this,

20:09.834 --> 20:12.002
or there's no place
for you in this house.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.770
Oh. Seconds, huh?
I must be doing
something right.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.356
It's not for me.
Thought I'd make a plate
for Trudy.

20:33.900 --> 20:38.653
Her appetite
for all things is insatiable.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.531
Mm-hmm. Little more.

20:41.616 --> 20:45.243
Cruz, Mouch, there's
an inspector from
headquarters outside.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.038
Oh, showtime!

20:51.167 --> 20:53.710
Tell you what.
Why don't I get in there,
fire up the burners,

20:53.794 --> 20:56.004
cook us up a couple brats,
show you what she can do.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.213
That won't be necessary.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.592
Well, of course.
Yeah, we don't wanna
waste your time.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.469
Uh, I'm afraid you're
too late for that.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.762
Say what?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.847
There's no way I can
permit this vehicle.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.099
You're missing a
wastewater retention tank,

21:08.184 --> 21:09.851
a designated
hand washing sink,

21:09.936 --> 21:12.228
even an integrated
fire suppression system.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.064
Uh, Inspector, we pored
over the regulations.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.149
None of those
were on the list.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.068
New regs.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.196
The city's cracking down
on rogue operators.

21:21.489 --> 21:25.033
Your best course of
action is to address the
violations and resubmit.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.203
Wait, uh, this could cost
us, like, 30 grand, easy.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.538
Good luck, gentlemen.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.552
I owe you an apology.
About my wedding.

21:45.346 --> 21:49.808
Oh, hey. Woman to woman?
You gotta do what you gotta
do to survive. I get it.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.060
Thanks.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.145
So, what are you
going to do, huh?

21:54.939 --> 21:57.857
Well, I have to
see him because I...

21:58.526 --> 22:00.026
I kinda stole his car.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.278
Stole? As in...

22:02.530 --> 22:03.947
Full-on grand theft auto.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.492
Mine was in the shop,
and I needed to get out.
So...

22:08.077 --> 22:09.995
Wow!
Eh.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.748
Doing a hell of job
with that liner, Candidate.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.208
Oh, well, I'm just,
you know,

22:15.292 --> 22:16.543
trying to take pride
in my work, Lieutenant.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.254
Mm-hmm. Um, what did you
want to talk about?

22:20.798 --> 22:22.090
Oh, uh...

22:27.430 --> 22:29.556
Well, I just thought it was
important for you to know

22:29.640 --> 22:31.433
that the delay
with the jacks,

22:31.934 --> 22:33.018
that was on me.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.439
Don't apologize.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.024
Just get it right
next time.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.608
Power wash, my ass.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.152
These new rules
are insane.

22:42.236 --> 22:43.695
And to make sure you do,

22:44.196 --> 22:46.364
Truck Company
will help you drill
on every tool we have

22:46.449 --> 22:48.783
until you get it right.
Starting now.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.246
Report to me on
her progress by
the end of shift.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.666
Come on, let's move.

23:19.190 --> 23:22.650
Listen, I'm prepared to
put 20 into the black eye
pool if you give me a hint.

23:23.944 --> 23:24.986
Not now, man.

23:28.365 --> 23:31.367
You know, how you spend
your time off shift,

23:31.452 --> 23:32.827
that's your business.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.497
But people in this house
count on you.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.332
You know what
I can count on?

23:37.708 --> 23:38.833
Nothing. No one.

23:39.668 --> 23:43.004
So why don't you
and everyone else in this
house just leave me alone?

23:44.882 --> 23:46.007
Really.

23:57.853 --> 24:01.397
I don't know, did it
seem like that inspector
really had it out for us?

24:02.650 --> 24:03.691
It's not us.

24:04.485 --> 24:05.485
It's me.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.490
I asked around Headquarters.
It turns out his boss,

24:10.574 --> 24:14.661
Chief Hale, has some
sort of vendetta against me.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.496
What'd you do, Herrmann?

24:16.580 --> 24:19.124
I don't know!
But I bet it's also
why I get

24:19.208 --> 24:21.292
passed over for every
lieutenant position
in the city.

24:22.253 --> 24:25.004
Okay, well, you gonna
have to make it right.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.881
How?
Apologize.

24:27.716 --> 24:32.387
For what? Normally when
I cheese somebody off,
I know what I did.

24:32.555 --> 24:36.558
Okay, but Mouch and Cruz
both sank their own
money into this.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.393
Not to mention
Newhouse's 20%.

24:39.061 --> 24:42.230
So, hey,
if this goes south,

24:42.857 --> 24:44.023
it's on you.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.239
Found it while packing up
our apartment.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.368
Freshman Sadie Hawkins.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.871
Happiest day of high school
when you asked.

25:01.959 --> 25:05.253
You have to stop
sending me money.
I can't accept it.

25:05.588 --> 25:08.214
I am not going to
carry old debts
into my new life.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.674
Uh, once the car
is paid for, you...

25:09.758 --> 25:11.926
I don't care about
the car, Sylvie.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.387
I care about you.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.647
You know that house
on Darlington?

25:25.691 --> 25:26.774
The one you
always loved?

25:29.695 --> 25:30.820
I put an offer on it.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.241
A place for us to live
and be married,

25:35.492 --> 25:37.911
and start a family.
Please just come
home with me.

25:37.995 --> 25:41.623
I'm... I'm starting
something here,
Harrison. I like it.

25:41.916 --> 25:46.127
I know you better than
anybody and I know that
this place is not for you.

25:53.844 --> 25:56.304
A toast to your first shift.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.889
Thanks.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.517
To your first day
as a firefighter.

26:02.645 --> 26:05.813
And yet, I almost got
a guy killed, and my
Lieutenant yelled at me.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.234
Oh, you think
that was yelling?

26:09.735 --> 26:12.195
Go ask Welch at 105
if that was yelling.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.489
So how was your day?

26:17.534 --> 26:18.576
Lieutenant problems.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.664
Severide.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.501
How bad is it?

26:28.462 --> 26:29.837
He's slipping away.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.469
You of all people know
what it's like to lose
someone close to you, baby.

26:39.974 --> 26:41.391
What pulled you out?

26:51.068 --> 26:52.443
Hey, Kelly.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.821
Kendra. Hey, um...

26:56.699 --> 26:59.659
I'm looking for a woman,
a gunshot victim who came
in night before last.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.035
The L-Train operator.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.912
She was discharged
earlier tonight.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.498
Well, that's good news,
right? And she'll be okay?

27:05.666 --> 27:08.960
She got some very good
pre-hospital care,
probably saved her life.

27:13.382 --> 27:17.510
I just want you to know,
we all miss Leslie so much.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.391
Yeah.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.530
Hi, may I help you?

27:37.614 --> 27:40.116
Uh, yes, you can.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.993
Uh, my name is
Christopher Herrmann,

27:42.077 --> 27:43.077
and I'm here to see
Chief Hale.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.954
Christopher Herrmann.
Firehouse 51?

27:45.914 --> 27:47.248
Uh, yeah.
How'd you know that?

27:47.333 --> 27:49.208
I'm sorry, the Chief's
in a meeting.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.045
Huh. It's okay,
I can wait.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.963
It could be a long time.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.717
Like, a really long time.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.095
Right, yeah.

28:02.765 --> 28:03.765
Um...

28:06.310 --> 28:08.186
Would you mind seeing
that he gets those?

28:08.270 --> 28:09.645
I'll do what I can.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.363
Man, it's good
to be back.

28:18.614 --> 28:19.697
You were here every day.

28:19.782 --> 28:21.949
I checked in
periodically.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.619
Yeah, every shift,
right before chow.

28:25.621 --> 28:29.123
Okay, breakfast is up.
Fresh eggs, sausages
from Bari's...

28:29.249 --> 28:33.044
Hey, Dawson,
do us a favor, huh?
Take a seat, relax.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.797
Hey, sit down, Candidate.
That's an order.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.341
Okay.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.813
Oh! Yuck. I totally forgot
to brush my teeth.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.024
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah. Hear that.

28:58.779 --> 29:01.864
Christopher,
this just came for you
from Headquarters.

29:01.949 --> 29:02.990
You gotta be kidding me.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.452
Whoa. Cigars from HQ?
You're finally getting
that promotion!

29:06.537 --> 29:08.287
No. That is not...

29:09.415 --> 29:12.333
You know what?
Here, enjoy 'em, guys.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.001
All right.
Okay.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.755
Mmm.

29:23.053 --> 29:24.137
Dawson.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.390
Truck 81 meeting.
Have a seat.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.685
Okay.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.612
Pouch!
Damn it. I forgot
to feed the dog.

29:42.573 --> 29:44.407
Oh! For the love
of all that's holy!

29:47.119 --> 29:49.620
Oh, my! I'm so glad
I didn't sit there.

29:51.540 --> 29:56.419
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambo 61, structure fire.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.297
Coming or not, rookie?
You only get
one first fire!

30:11.059 --> 30:12.268
Battalion 25 to Main,

30:12.436 --> 30:15.021
we have a five story
boarded-up structure,
fully involved.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.189
Copy that, Battalion 25.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.607
Brett, Mills,
down here, now.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.778
Casey, Severide,
we're going to lose
this building.

30:23.238 --> 30:27.450
Engine 51, hold back the
fire so that Truck and Squad
can search the first floor.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.868
On it.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.913
All right, I want a
full primary search,
nothing goes unchecked.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.414
Herrmann,
you got Dawson.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.543
Dawson, stay back,
get yourself a supply
line over to the hydrant

30:37.628 --> 30:40.254
before the engine's
reserve runs out, okay?

30:40.422 --> 30:41.923
Loud and clear.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.302
No, honey, just breathe.

30:46.386 --> 30:47.345
The others.

30:47.429 --> 30:48.846
I know, we're in there
looking for them right now.

30:48.931 --> 30:51.724
The basement.
There are 15 more.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.520
Chief, we got 15 more
in the basement.

30:55.938 --> 30:57.355
Squad 3, Truck 81,

30:57.439 --> 31:00.024
redirect to the basement.
We have 15 civilians.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.651
25 to Main,
new deal, new deal.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.569
We're gonna need
an EMS plan two.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.821
Copy that, Battalion 25.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.288
Chief, hydrant's
been vandalized.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.917
Find some water, Dawson,
before that engine runs dry.

31:23.090 --> 31:26.384
- Engine's losing water.
- We need that new line.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.052
They're all stripped.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.137
So, uh, people are
dying because of
a five dollar part?

31:32.933 --> 31:34.642
We're losing pressure.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.894
Okay.
Water's almost gone.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.479
Everyone pull out.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.981
Chief, we're almost there.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.400
Not without water
you're not. Pull out, now!

31:45.445 --> 31:49.865
Hey. Grab a horseshoe,
follow me.

32:13.015 --> 32:14.807
Dawson,
where's that water?

32:18.353 --> 32:20.438
I'll make the run.
Open when I call for water.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.772
Okay.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.112
Where's our water?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.540
Reid, send the water!

32:42.210 --> 32:43.711
Here we go!

32:43.920 --> 32:46.547
Truck, Squad,
resume search and rescue.

32:47.174 --> 32:48.215
Damn, girl.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.433
Have you found them?

32:57.517 --> 32:58.809
They're trying, honey.

32:58.894 --> 33:01.729
Yeah. They're coming
out now, alive.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.274
I got her from here.

33:05.359 --> 33:07.777
Thank you. Take a seat
for me, okay?

33:08.278 --> 33:09.945
Hey, Brett,
I need the oxygen.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.574
That was a brave
thing you did.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.955
Sit them down. Take her
right there, okay?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.417
Sit down.
Okay. Thanks.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.711
Basement door
was chained shut.

33:25.796 --> 33:27.505
First girl must have
squeezed out
to warn everyone.

33:27.589 --> 33:28.589
Trafficking?

33:28.799 --> 33:30.299
I'm thinking sweatshop.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.472
Hey, Herrmann.
We need all hands.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.266
Dawson, mask up.

33:39.768 --> 33:40.935
You're coming in.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.772
Keep one hand on
the wall at all times.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.525
You stay glued to me,
you conserve your air,
you got it?

33:47.609 --> 33:48.901
Copy.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.490
Take a seat.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.659
Damn it. Come on, girl!

33:56.785 --> 33:58.744
You can't do this! Okay.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.081
One, two, three,
four, five...

34:02.290 --> 34:04.125
Brett...
Six, seven, eight.

34:04.626 --> 34:05.793
Come on. Breathe.
Nine, ten...

34:05.877 --> 34:07.002
Brett, we got more
on the way.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.088
Come on, the ambulance
is almost here!
Just let me...

34:11.842 --> 34:14.969
Come on, let me...
Brett.
Brett, come on.

34:16.930 --> 34:18.973
Brett! Brett!

34:22.936 --> 34:24.603
Brett, there's more
coming out.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.648
I can take her.

34:28.483 --> 34:29.567
She'll take care of you.

34:29.651 --> 34:31.110
Hey, Dawson, let's go.
One more trip in.

34:31.653 --> 34:32.778
Okay.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.244
Okay, confirmation just in.

34:41.955 --> 34:44.081
Today's fire was
a sweatshop operation.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.376
We lost one.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.337
But fifteen others
got a chance at a new life.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.507
And that is something
to be proud of.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.266
Also, I think
it's worth mentioning

35:02.392 --> 35:04.685
that today was our
candidate's very first fire.

35:07.773 --> 35:11.108
And in the light of that,
there's an old tradition

35:11.193 --> 35:13.569
that I think we should
bring back to 51.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.029
Come on, let's go.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.155
Uh-oh!
- Yeah, Dawson.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.239
Come on!

35:18.784 --> 35:23.537
Now, it used to be that
when a rookie excelled
at their first fire,

35:23.955 --> 35:28.042
they were given the privilege
of putting the truck to bed
at the end of shift.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.211
So, Gabby Dawson,

35:33.465 --> 35:35.049
you made us proud today.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.552
And I say we give
her the honor.

35:45.727 --> 35:47.353
All right! Yeah!

35:47.437 --> 35:48.896
Come on, Candidate, go!

35:49.064 --> 35:50.314
I mean,
if that's an order.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.357
Ah!
You bet your ass.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.566
Get in there.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.571
Come on, girl,
what you waiting for?

36:04.371 --> 36:05.830
Hey! Hey! Ah!

36:10.418 --> 36:13.087
Yeah. Okay, all right,
yeah, you got me good.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.089
Bup-bup, hey,
where you going?

36:16.258 --> 36:17.883
You think this mess
is gonna clean itself?

36:20.971 --> 36:22.096
You were amazing.

36:23.598 --> 36:24.807
Now get to work.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.072
Kelly, can I talk to
you for a second?

36:59.593 --> 37:03.470
You made me listen to
you when Hallie died.
Now it's your turn.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.314
I loved Hallie.

37:15.609 --> 37:17.359
Thought we'd be
together forever.

37:20.030 --> 37:23.073
I still think
I'm gonna bump into her
in a store or she's

37:23.158 --> 37:25.993
gonna call me
out of the blue or somethin'.

37:30.332 --> 37:33.208
Truthfully,
as screwed up as that is,

37:34.169 --> 37:35.794
I love that feeling.

37:39.841 --> 37:44.595
Listen, this house needs you.

37:46.181 --> 37:50.684
And whether you like it
or not, you need this house.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.156
Look, I really wanna
make this work.
You and me.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.033
I thought it was.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.745
This isn't some
small town in Indiana.

38:09.829 --> 38:10.996
This is Chicago.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.122
Yeah, no kidding.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.125
You're gonna see things
that you could've
never imagined.

38:15.377 --> 38:18.879
And people and situations
that make you sick
to your stomach, okay?

38:19.255 --> 38:23.008
But I need to know that
you're gonna be able to stay
with me through anything.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.843
I...
We save who we can.

38:25.303 --> 38:29.807
If you get attached or lose
focus, a rescue becomes
a recovery in a blink.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.730
I'm just saying this
for your own good, Sylvie.

38:57.127 --> 39:00.587
You know, usually when
First Watch rolls in,
that's our cue to go home.

39:01.423 --> 39:03.215
Thought I'd pick up a
second shift.

39:06.428 --> 39:08.887
Hey, listen,

39:11.474 --> 39:14.768
I'm still working on things,
and I'm sorry
if I dropped the ball.

39:15.228 --> 39:18.105
I appreciate what you did,
what you're doing
for the house.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.398
I'm glad
you're still here.

39:20.692 --> 39:24.737
Thanks. And for now,
I'm good where I am.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.581
Sylvie.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.391
Hey, Chief Hale,

39:54.768 --> 39:55.768
my name
is Christopher...

39:55.852 --> 39:58.520
Herrmann.
I know who you are.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.899
Listen, hey! Listen,
I get it. All right?

40:01.983 --> 40:03.859
You got a beef with me.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.779
Sandbag my career, fine.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.782
But don't take it out
on Molly's too.

40:11.201 --> 40:15.329
You're only hurting some
good guys who are trying
to start an honest business.

40:16.039 --> 40:19.249
Look, I don't know
what it is that I did
to piss you off...

40:19.334 --> 40:20.542
You really don't know?

40:29.761 --> 40:32.346
There's a reason my car's
parked down the street.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.480
Energy water.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.982
Or as you pitched it
two years ago

40:44.067 --> 40:47.986
at the CFD picnic as
a "guaranteed nest egg."

40:51.116 --> 40:52.116
Yep.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.492
Oh, boy.

40:58.873 --> 40:59.915
Hey.

41:03.670 --> 41:06.171
Hey! How are you feeling?

41:06.381 --> 41:08.882
I was shot, you know.
Hurts like hell.

41:09.384 --> 41:10.717
What you got there?

41:10.885 --> 41:15.139
Just a thank you.
You can pretend they're
fat free, but they're not.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.516
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

41:18.810 --> 41:19.852
Thanks to you.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.145
Nah!

41:22.897 --> 41:25.023
I need to meet this
paramedic friend of yours.

41:27.235 --> 41:29.736
Uh, she's actually, um...

41:32.907 --> 41:34.074
She's dead.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.411
I'm sorry.

41:49.883 --> 41:50.883
She's here.

41:51.718 --> 41:52.885
I can feel her.
