01:23.383 --> 01:25.383
Love sure is a funny thing.

01:25.383 --> 01:28.384
Makes you happy. Makes you sad.

01:28.384 --> 01:30.384
Makes you do all sorts of things...

01:30.384 --> 01:31.384
you never thought you'd do before.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.385
In fact, love's the reason...

01:34.385 --> 01:36.385
I'm laying here dying.

01:37.382 --> 01:39.383
- Uh-huh.
- No, there's not.

01:39.383 --> 01:42.383
- Oh, I see it, there it is!
- Told ya.

01:42.383 --> 01:45.384
- I still don't see it.
- It's right there.

01:45.384 --> 01:47.384
Steven!

01:47.384 --> 01:49.384
- I still don't see it.
- Steven!

01:49.384 --> 01:51.385
Come on, honey.

02:00.385 --> 02:01.386
Now, Steven.

02:01.386 --> 02:03.385
We wanna tell you
something very important,

02:03.385 --> 02:06.386
but I want you to know
that it doesn't change a thing.

02:06.386 --> 02:08.386
We're still gonna love you.

02:08.386 --> 02:11.385
- You're still...
- You're adopted.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.386
- It's true.
- Ow.

02:17.385 --> 02:19.385
You're a very special little boy.

02:19.385 --> 02:20.386
But do you know why?

02:22.386 --> 02:23.387
Because we chose you.

02:24.386 --> 02:25.387
Your mother's right, son.

02:26.387 --> 02:27.387
It's because we love you.

02:27.387 --> 02:31.387
We put some money in a paper bag...

02:31.387 --> 02:34.386
and gave it to your real mommy
in the hospital parking lot...

02:35.387 --> 02:38.386
so you could come home with us,
okay?

02:39.386 --> 02:40.387
It hurt a bit.

02:41.386 --> 02:43.387
But I decided I wasn't
gonna let that get me down.

02:44.387 --> 02:45.387
Let's go, people, let's go!

02:45.387 --> 02:46.387
No way.

02:46.387 --> 02:47.387
Where's the crash cart?

02:47.387 --> 02:53.388
I decided I would be the best son,
no, the best person I could be.

02:58.388 --> 03:00.388
IN THE RESURRECTION MORNING...

03:00.388 --> 03:02.388
WHEN THE TRUMP OF
GOD SHALL SOUND...

03:02.388 --> 03:07.389
WE SHALL RISE, WE SHALL RISE.

03:07.389 --> 03:09.388
WE SHALL RISE, HALLELUJAH.

03:09.388 --> 03:12.388
WE SHALL RISE, AMEN. WE SHALL...

03:12.388 --> 03:14.388
RISE HALLELUJAH...

03:14.388 --> 03:16.388
ON THE RESURRECTION MORNING.

03:16.388 --> 03:18.389
WHEN DEATH'S PRISON
BARS ARE BROKEN...

03:18.389 --> 03:23.388
WE SHALL RISE, WE SHALL RISE.

03:24.389 --> 03:25.389
- Morning, Steven.
- Bill.

03:25.389 --> 03:27.389
- You got somethin'.
- Thanks, darlin'.

03:30.390 --> 03:31.389
- Hey, Steven.
- Hey, guys.

03:31.389 --> 03:33.389
- How's it hangin'?
- Oh, to the left.

03:33.389 --> 03:35.390
Ho, gunslinger. Look out.

03:40.390 --> 03:40.390
- Smitty.
- Hey, Steve.

03:40.390 --> 03:42.390
- Weiss.
- Hey, Steven.

03:52.390 --> 03:54.390
And you've got a chocolate bar
and a piece of cake.

03:54.390 --> 03:56.391
You got a loose tooth.

03:56.391 --> 03:58.391
That's 2 that's coming in, isn't it?

03:58.391 --> 03:59.391
I brushed my gums.

04:00.392 --> 04:02.392
I got your nose. Look at that.

04:02.392 --> 04:03.391
That's your finger.

04:04.392 --> 04:05.392
No, it's not. It's your nose.

04:05.392 --> 04:06.392
I can smell you.

04:07.392 --> 04:08.391
You smell really good.

04:10.391 --> 04:12.392
You have lots of dreams, okay?

04:15.391 --> 04:16.391
Okay.

04:17.392 --> 04:18.391
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.392
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:25.392 --> 04:27.393
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:28.392 --> 04:29.393
Good night.

04:30.392 --> 04:31.393
Good night.

04:32.393 --> 04:33.393
Good night.

04:34.393 --> 04:35.393
And if it wasn't for you, Jesus...

04:35.393 --> 04:38.393
I would have never found that
last coffee filter.

04:38.393 --> 04:40.393
And Prayer Girls would
have been ruined for sure.

04:40.393 --> 04:43.392
- So, thank you for that.
- Amen.

04:43.392 --> 04:46.393
And for Stephie's allergy screen
coming back all negative.

04:47.393 --> 04:49.393
That would have been a nightmare.

04:49.393 --> 04:53.393
I know that it was in your plan
for her to enjoy nuts in her life...

04:53.393 --> 04:56.394
and not end up like little Wendy
who blew up like a balloon and...

04:56.394 --> 04:59.395
they had to cut a hole in her throat
so that she could breathe.

05:01.395 --> 05:02.394
And, finally...

05:02.394 --> 05:05.395
I would like to thank you for
this man, Jesus.

05:05.395 --> 05:11.394
This man who works so hard
to make us happy,

05:11.394 --> 05:15.394
This man who pursued me
to the ends of the Earth...

05:15.394 --> 05:18.395
and promised me a life
of eternal happiness.

05:18.395 --> 05:19.395
And he's kept that promise,

05:19.395 --> 05:20.395
oh, Lord, he has.

05:20.395 --> 05:24.396
- Every day. Amen.
- Amen.

05:24.396 --> 05:27.395
It's just sometimes I wanna cry
when I think about how happy I am.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.396
It's like the time you were there...

05:32.396 --> 05:36.396
Deb, you know how as a cop
I have access to records and things?

05:37.395 --> 05:38.395
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:39.396 --> 05:42.395
Do you think it would be unethical
for me to use that to find my mother?

05:43.396 --> 05:44.395
What?

05:47.396 --> 05:49.396
I think that's probably something
that you need to think about.

05:50.396 --> 05:51.397
And maybe at another time?

05:52.397 --> 05:53.397
Right. I shouldn't have done it.

05:54.397 --> 05:58.398
You did it? What'd you find?

05:58.398 --> 06:00.398
I haven't looked. It's downstairs.

06:01.397 --> 06:04.397
Steven! Oh, my God. Let's go look!

06:04.397 --> 06:05.397
- Oh, wait, hold on.
- What?

06:05.397 --> 06:06.398
Let me finish.

06:09.396 --> 06:10.397
It's chicken scratch, mostly.

06:10.397 --> 06:14.397
- Ooh, what's that?
- She's right here.

06:16.398 --> 06:17.398
She's been here the whole time.

06:18.398 --> 06:21.399
- Is that her?
- Without question.

06:22.398 --> 06:24.398
Well, that's wonderful.

06:28.398 --> 06:30.399
You want me to make some cookies?
I'm gonna make some cookies.

06:30.399 --> 06:33.399
Let's make some cookies.
You wanna make some cookies?

06:34.399 --> 06:35.399
No cookies?

06:36.399 --> 06:37.398
He's in Defib!

06:37.398 --> 06:38.399
Where is the fucking crash cart?

06:39.398 --> 06:41.398
And one. And two. And three.

06:41.398 --> 06:43.399
Charge to two hundred.

06:43.399 --> 06:45.399
And one. And two.

06:45.399 --> 06:46.399
Clear.

06:46.399 --> 06:48.400
Recharge 300.

06:48.400 --> 06:53.401
Truth be told, the reason I became
a cop was to find my real mother.

06:53.401 --> 06:55.400
Maybe it wasn't the right thing to do.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.400
Maybe it wasn't the moral thing to do.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
But, hell. I just wasn't hearing it.

07:03.401 --> 07:04.400
Look at that.

07:16.401 --> 07:18.401
Is something wrong, Officer?

07:19.401 --> 07:20.401
Are you Barbara Bascombe?

07:21.400 --> 07:23.400
Yes. Is something wrong?

07:26.401 --> 07:29.402
You gave a baby up for adoption,
correct?

07:31.402 --> 07:34.402
I don't think I know
what you're talking about.

07:34.402 --> 07:35.403
Okay.

07:37.402 --> 07:38.401
You were young.

07:38.401 --> 07:40.402
You made a mistake giving me away.

07:40.402 --> 07:42.402
Mom, please, let me finish.

07:42.402 --> 07:43.402
We all make mistakes.

07:43.402 --> 07:45.403
I came here to say I forgive you.

07:46.403 --> 07:47.402
Because none of us is perfect.

07:47.402 --> 07:49.402
With a fresh start, we can build.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.402
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Steven.

07:53.402 --> 07:55.403
Just tell me why!

07:55.403 --> 07:56.403
Go away!

07:56.403 --> 08:00.404
Okay, okay, I understand.
It's a lot at once.

08:01.403 --> 08:02.404
I'll come back, how's that?

08:03.403 --> 08:04.404
I'll come back later.

08:04.404 --> 08:05.404
I'll bring us some coffee...

08:05.404 --> 08:07.405
and we can talk about
why you abandoned me...

08:07.405 --> 08:09.404
and kept your other two children!

08:10.403 --> 08:12.404
I was the middle child.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.403
What was wrong with me?

08:15.403 --> 08:16.403
What was wrong with me?

08:17.404 --> 08:19.404
What was wrong...

08:19.404 --> 08:21.404
Oh, shit. I broke your screen.

08:21.404 --> 08:23.404
I'm so sor... I broke your screen.

08:23.404 --> 08:25.404
Oh, fuck it.

08:25.404 --> 08:29.405
You know what?
I'm gonna take this mat.

08:29.405 --> 08:30.405
'Cause it's a lie.

08:33.405 --> 08:38.405
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

08:38.405 --> 08:39.404
I'm goin'.

08:40.404 --> 08:42.405
I quit the force that day.

08:43.404 --> 08:46.405
I packed up my family
and I moved to Texas.

08:47.406 --> 08:49.406
Take these in the kitchen.

08:52.405 --> 08:54.406
Steven? Hi. Come on up.

08:55.406 --> 08:56.406
You haven't met
our new neighbors yet.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.407
Across the street and down two.
Neil and Sara.

08:59.407 --> 09:00.406
No, I haven't.

09:00.406 --> 09:02.407
I hope you're changing the paint.

09:02.407 --> 09:03.407
What do you call that color?

09:03.407 --> 09:05.407
No, we're changing it.

09:05.407 --> 09:06.406
Good, good, good.

09:06.406 --> 09:09.406
Debbie tells me you used to be
on the police force back in Georgia.

09:09.406 --> 09:10.406
Virginia Beach.

09:10.406 --> 09:12.406
I kinda lost interest, you know.

09:12.406 --> 09:14.407
Went back into the family business.

09:14.407 --> 09:15.406
What's that?

09:15.406 --> 09:17.406
Produce. I work for Cisco.

09:17.406 --> 09:19.407
Always fresh, never frozen.

09:19.407 --> 09:21.407
It's got great benefits, too.

09:22.407 --> 09:23.408
Yeah, and the hours don't crush me.

09:24.408 --> 09:25.408
Plenty of home time.

09:25.408 --> 09:28.408
Yeah, now I can keep my eye on him.

09:28.408 --> 09:29.409
Among other things.

09:29.409 --> 09:30.408
No.

09:31.409 --> 09:32.407
Watch out.

09:51.409 --> 09:55.409
I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come!

09:56.410 --> 09:59.408
Do it, man. Come in my ass.

10:00.409 --> 10:02.409
Did I forget to mention I'm gay?

10:03.410 --> 10:08.409
Yep. I'm gay.
Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.

10:08.409 --> 10:10.409
Have been as long as I remember.

10:11.410 --> 10:14.409
Hey, look up. I see a pony.

10:14.409 --> 10:15.410
What do you see?

10:15.410 --> 10:17.410
I see a diesel train.

10:17.410 --> 10:18.410
I see a whirly-bird.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.411
I see a wiener.

10:21.411 --> 10:23.411
What? What kinda wiener?

10:26.410 --> 10:29.410
Shut up. There's no wiener.

10:29.410 --> 10:30.411
Uh-huh.

10:30.411 --> 10:31.410
No, there's not.

10:32.411 --> 10:34.411
Oh, I see it. There it is.

10:35.410 --> 10:36.410
I still don't see it.

10:37.410 --> 10:39.411
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.

10:39.411 --> 10:42.411
Do it, man. Come in my ass.

10:42.411 --> 10:44.411
And I did.

10:49.412 --> 10:52.411
I have been living a lie
for a long, long time.

10:54.411 --> 10:56.411
I tend to do that. Hide things.

10:57.412 --> 11:00.413
So I told Debbie I had
clients to entertain or...

11:01.412 --> 11:04.413
I was working late, just little lies.

11:05.413 --> 11:07.412
Sometimes you have to shave
a little off the puzzle piece...

11:07.412 --> 11:08.413
just to make it fit.

11:09.412 --> 11:14.413
But of course life has a way of
forcing these things into the light.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.413
You might even call it an epiphany.

11:29.414 --> 11:31.414
I haven't lived my life.

11:32.414 --> 11:35.415
- Try not to speak, sir.
- Fuck you.

11:36.414 --> 11:38.414
No one's gonna tell me
what to do anymore.

11:39.414 --> 11:40.415
No more lies.

11:41.414 --> 11:44.414
I'm gonna live my life my way.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.414
Be the real me.

11:48.414 --> 11:53.414
Buy what I want do what I want,
fuck who I want.

11:53.414 --> 11:55.415
My way.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.416
Okay, sir. Whatever you say.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.415
- I'm gonna be a fag.
- Okay.

11:59.416 --> 12:01.416
- A big fag.
- All right.

12:01.416 --> 12:05.415
You hear me?
I'm gonna be a fag.

12:08.415 --> 12:09.416
Faggot!

12:09.416 --> 12:12.415
That's what they're gonna call me.

12:12.415 --> 12:13.415
Yep, just like that...

12:14.415 --> 12:17.416
I decided to start my life over
and live it like the real me.

12:21.416 --> 12:24.417
Of course it was a delicate situation.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.417
So I'd have to find the right way
to break it to Debbie.

12:27.417 --> 12:28.417
You're what?

12:29.417 --> 12:30.417
I'm gay!

12:38.416 --> 12:40.416
Life was good.

12:40.416 --> 12:43.417
I moved to Florida
got two adorable pups...

12:43.417 --> 12:45.417
and a boyfriend named Jimmy.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.418
I swear. I bought anything
that caught my eye.

12:49.418 --> 12:52.418
Clothes jewelry,
you name it I snatched it up.

12:53.418 --> 12:56.419
I was the guy everyone called to
find out where the new hotspots

12:56.419 --> 12:59.419
were clubs, bars, restaurants.

12:59.419 --> 13:00.419
I knew them all.

13:01.419 --> 13:04.419
And sometimes I'd even stay at hotels
on the weekend because...

13:04.419 --> 13:06.418
I heard they had great bathrooms.

13:06.418 --> 13:09.418
Or room service. Or really hot bellboys.

13:10.418 --> 13:12.418
But it didn't take me
long to realize something

13:12.418 --> 13:14.419
that never occurred to me before.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.419
Actually, no one ever really
talks about this, but...

13:19.420 --> 13:20.419
Cash or charge?

13:20.419 --> 13:23.420
Being gay is really expensive.

13:23.420 --> 13:24.420
Charge.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.420
But it was nowhere
near good enough...

13:28.420 --> 13:31.420
for living as high on the gay hog
as I wanted to.

13:31.420 --> 13:32.420
- US-1, right?
- Finest in the land.

13:33.420 --> 13:36.420
For a guy with
no college education...

13:38.420 --> 13:39.419
my options were...

13:41.420 --> 13:41.420
limited.

13:44.420 --> 13:45.420
Oh, my back!

13:46.421 --> 13:49.421
Oh, I can't believe
I slipped on virgin oil.

13:49.421 --> 13:52.421
Ah, don't touch me.
Oh, no, don't tou... Oh.

13:53.422 --> 13:54.421
So, I had no choice.

13:57.421 --> 13:58.421
I became a conman.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.421
Your check.

14:00.421 --> 14:04.420
Yep. Insurance fraud
credit card fraud, passport fraud.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.421
I was selling bad tomatoes.

14:06.421 --> 14:08.421
Anything to make a buck.

14:09.421 --> 14:11.422
- And best of all.
- There you go.

14:11.422 --> 14:12.422
No one got hurt.

14:13.422 --> 14:14.422
Thank you, Mr. Evans...

14:15.422 --> 14:16.423
can I see some I.D., please?

14:16.423 --> 14:17.422
Of course you can.

14:26.422 --> 14:29.423
What do you think? Yes?

14:31.423 --> 14:33.424
Well, Steven, it's beautiful.

14:33.424 --> 14:35.423
- You don't like it.
- No, I do.

14:35.423 --> 14:37.423
- You don't like it.
- No, I do.

14:37.423 --> 14:39.423
Tell me what's wrong with it.

14:39.423 --> 14:40.423
Is it the gold?

14:44.423 --> 14:44.423
Well.

14:45.424 --> 14:46.423
That's why I got it in stainless.

14:47.424 --> 14:48.425
Gold one's for me, dipshit.

14:48.425 --> 14:50.424
Why do you do that?

14:54.424 --> 14:55.424
Parump-a-pump-pump.

14:55.424 --> 14:57.424
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey, Deb.

14:58.425 --> 14:59.424
How's Jimmy?

14:59.424 --> 15:01.424
He's good. Did you get my gifts?

15:03.425 --> 15:05.424
I can't keep this.

15:05.424 --> 15:06.424
Why not?

15:06.424 --> 15:09.425
This is not what the Lord wants.

15:09.425 --> 15:11.425
So you're saying you know
what the Lord wants?

15:11.425 --> 15:13.425
- No.
- That's what it sounds like.

15:13.425 --> 15:15.426
Well, I'm not saying that.
Well, I'm not...

15:15.426 --> 15:17.425
Mommy, look!

15:18.424 --> 15:20.425
Steven! Cheese and crackers!

15:24.425 --> 15:25.426
Bo-nos dias, Pilaf.

15:25.426 --> 15:27.426
Oh, hi,
Steven, you've got some visitors.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.426
Okey-dokey.

15:36.426 --> 15:37.426
We don't think so.

15:41.426 --> 15:42.426
Oh, God.

15:43.425 --> 15:45.426
Oh, great. Impale.

15:54.427 --> 15:56.427
Where the fuck is the fucking stairs?

16:03.428 --> 16:05.427
The thing of it is, I'd been a cop.

16:06.428 --> 16:07.428
And I knew whatjail was like.

16:08.428 --> 16:09.427
Fuck me.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.427
There was no way I was going there.

16:12.428 --> 16:16.428
But I had a plan and
everything was gonna be jim-dandy.

16:34.430 --> 16:35.428
Oh, come on.

16:56.431 --> 16:58.431
Hey. Hey.

17:00.431 --> 17:01.430
I'm sorry.

17:02.430 --> 17:04.430
Why didn't you tell me?

17:04.430 --> 17:05.430
I can't go to prison, Jimmy.

17:06.430 --> 17:08.430
I can't go to prison.
I can't. I can't.

17:08.430 --> 17:11.431
It's okay. Calm down.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.430
It's okay.

17:14.431 --> 17:16.431
I just wanna tell 'em you're awake.

17:16.431 --> 17:19.432
We can take it from there, okay?

17:41.433 --> 17:43.433
I don't think he knows himself, really.

17:43.433 --> 17:46.433
I think that
he's searchin' for somethin'.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.433
Can you tell me exactly what he did?

17:49.433 --> 17:51.434
He has several warrants in Texas.

17:55.433 --> 17:56.433
I just wonder.

17:57.433 --> 18:01.434
Is the gay thing
and stealing something...

18:02.434 --> 18:04.433
that goes hand in hand or...?

18:06.434 --> 18:07.433
What the fuck are you talking about?

18:08.434 --> 18:09.433
This stealing thing. Is, is you...

18:10.434 --> 18:10.434
Steven!

18:15.434 --> 18:16.435
Steven!

18:16.435 --> 18:18.435
- Hey, where's my patient?
- Steven!

18:37.435 --> 18:39.435
- Steven, stop!
- Steven! Steven, stop!

18:39.435 --> 18:41.435
- Stop!
- Steven, I'm serious.

18:41.435 --> 18:43.436
You stop or you'll never see me again.

18:45.436 --> 18:48.436
- I mean it.
- Wait, stop.

18:48.436 --> 18:49.435
- Steven!
- No!

18:50.436 --> 18:51.435
- Steven, no!
- Steven, don'tjump!

19:02.437 --> 19:05.437
After several appeals
and some painful personal losses...

19:06.436 --> 19:07.437
I finally went to prison.

19:32.439 --> 19:35.439
Hi. Welcome to prison.

19:35.439 --> 19:38.438
I'm Steven. Oh, don't be scared.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.439
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

19:40.438 --> 19:43.438
First time? Yeah.

19:43.438 --> 19:45.439
You just need to know some
ins and outs and you'll be fine.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.439
Hey, let me show you around.

19:51.439 --> 19:52.439
Law library.

19:52.439 --> 19:53.439
I pretty much live here.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.440
Don't really have anybody on the
outside except for my ex-wife, my kid...

19:59.440 --> 20:01.440
so I hunker down here...

20:01.440 --> 20:04.440
learn everything there is to know
about the law. Ask me anything.

20:05.439 --> 20:08.439
See him? Over there? Him?

20:09.439 --> 20:10.439
Anything you want from the outside...

20:10.439 --> 20:11.439
he's the guy.

20:11.439 --> 20:13.440
Candy, cigarettes, drugs, whatever.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.440
He's the guy. Just keep in mind...

20:16.440 --> 20:18.440
it's gonna cost you a lot of money or...

20:18.440 --> 20:21.441
you can suck his dick, your choice.

20:22.441 --> 20:23.441
You'll catch a beatin' any day now.

20:23.441 --> 20:25.441
That's just the way it is.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.442
I lost 3 teeth. Cracked a vertebrae.

20:27.442 --> 20:30.441
Anyway, all you gotta do is fight back.

20:30.441 --> 20:32.442
Win or lose, just fight back.

20:32.442 --> 20:34.441
Or you could suck the guy's dick.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.440
Your choice.

20:36.441 --> 20:38.441
Letters, magazines, shit like that...

20:38.441 --> 20:39.441
it all goes through unmolested.

20:40.441 --> 20:41.441
But if Grandma sends you cookies...

20:41.441 --> 20:43.441
or porn or brownies or whatever,

20:44.442 --> 20:45.441
you have to pay for it
if you wanna get it.

20:46.442 --> 20:47.441
Five bucks per item.

20:47.441 --> 20:49.442
Or you can suck my dick.

20:49.442 --> 20:50.442
Your choice.

20:51.442 --> 20:53.443
Anyway, that's the whole shebang.

20:54.443 --> 20:55.443
You'll do great. Don't worry.

20:55.443 --> 20:58.443
And if you need anything at all
you just ask me, all right?

20:58.443 --> 21:01.443
So, do I need to suck your dick?

21:01.443 --> 21:02.441
That'd be great.

21:06.442 --> 21:09.443
Hey. This is Debbie and Stephie.

21:09.443 --> 21:10.443
Sorry we missed you.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.443
Leave a message after the beep
and God bless you.

21:14.444 --> 21:16.444
Hey, Debbie. Hi, sweetheart.

21:16.444 --> 21:17.443
Sorry I missed you.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.444
I thought 1:00 was our time
but maybe not. Oh, I miss you guys.

21:26.444 --> 21:29.444
Sometimes it's nice to know that
somebody still cares about me.

21:30.444 --> 21:32.443
You do still care, don't you, Deb?

21:34.443 --> 21:37.444
Sorry. Sometimes I forget
I'm talking to the machine.

22:20.446 --> 22:21.446
Thank you.

22:30.448 --> 22:32.448
Civil law? I'm an attorney.

22:33.447 --> 22:34.447
Really?

22:34.447 --> 22:37.447
Yeah. You suing somebody?

22:37.447 --> 22:39.447
I don't know what I'm doing.

22:39.447 --> 22:44.448
A guy I know is in the infirmary...

22:44.448 --> 22:46.447
He's sick, real sick. He AIDS.

22:46.447 --> 22:51.448
Well, I thought maybe I could find a way
to get him some help...

22:51.448 --> 22:53.449
some real help, not here, but...

22:54.448 --> 22:56.448
So I thought maybe if I could...

22:57.449 --> 23:00.449
I don't even really know
what I'm looking for.

23:01.449 --> 23:03.448
Tell him to get in touch with
the Prisoner Rights Committee.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.449
They deal with this all the time,
pro bono.

23:05.449 --> 23:06.449
I got the number.

23:06.449 --> 23:07.449
Why, thank you.

23:08.449 --> 23:09.449
My name is Steven Russell.

23:10.450 --> 23:11.448
Nice to meet you, Steven Russell.

23:11.448 --> 23:13.448
My name is Phillip Morris.

23:15.449 --> 23:16.449
Phillip.

23:19.449 --> 23:21.449
I haven't seen you around. Phillip.

23:21.449 --> 23:22.450
I'm always in the yard.

23:23.449 --> 23:25.451
Well, I, I, I don't go in that yard.

23:26.450 --> 23:28.450
I mean, you know what happens
to blonde haired,

23:28.450 --> 23:30.451
blue-eyed queers in that yard.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.450
It is kind of rough out there.

23:34.450 --> 23:37.451
You don't look like you belong here.
Phillip.

23:37.451 --> 23:40.450
I rented a car. Kept it too long.

23:40.450 --> 23:43.450
- Grand theft?
- Theft of service.

23:43.450 --> 23:44.451
Insurance fraud.

23:44.451 --> 23:46.451
No. Just theft of service.

23:46.451 --> 23:47.451
No, me. Insurance fraud.

23:49.451 --> 23:50.451
Damn.

23:50.451 --> 23:51.451
We're in a mess, aren't we?

23:51.451 --> 23:52.452
It don't seem fair, does it?

23:52.452 --> 23:53.451
No, it don't.

23:54.452 --> 23:58.452
I made the mistake of writin' her
and telling her I was lonely in here.

23:59.452 --> 24:00.452
Next thing you know my ex-wife

24:00.452 --> 24:03.452
catches her putting nthe neighbor's
puppy in a box to mail to me.

24:04.451 --> 24:07.452
She almost suffocated the poor thing.

24:10.451 --> 24:12.452
She sounds so sweet.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.452
Oh, she's an angel.

24:16.452 --> 24:19.453
I think I'm gonna write her back
tell her I'm not lonely anymore.

24:20.452 --> 24:22.453
That I made a good friend.

24:25.453 --> 24:26.454
What?

24:29.454 --> 24:31.452
Why'd I have to meet you today?

24:33.452 --> 24:34.453
Something wrong?

24:34.453 --> 24:36.453
It's just, I'm being transferred...

24:36.453 --> 24:37.452
to the Michael Unit today.

24:38.453 --> 24:39.453
Oh.

24:39.453 --> 24:40.453
I'm sorry.

24:42.453 --> 24:43.454
Don't be sorry.

24:44.454 --> 24:46.454
It's just across the yard.

24:46.454 --> 24:47.454
But I don't go out in the yard.

24:47.454 --> 24:49.455
It might as well be Oklahoma.

24:50.454 --> 24:52.454
Just figures with my luck.

24:52.454 --> 24:54.455
I was born on Friday the 13th?

24:54.455 --> 24:56.455
It's not gonna make a difference.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.455
Friday the 13th is my lucky day.

25:03.454 --> 25:04.455
Don't worry. It's right here.

25:05.454 --> 25:06.455
This is destiny.

25:07.454 --> 25:09.455
But we only just met.

25:09.455 --> 25:10.455
Listen.

25:10.455 --> 25:13.455
I loved a lot and I've been around.

25:13.455 --> 25:15.455
So I recognize the feeling.

25:15.455 --> 25:17.455
That feeling you and I
are having right now.

25:17.455 --> 25:20.456
The feeling you're trying to forget
exists 'cause you're going away.

25:21.457 --> 25:24.455
But there's about 6000 volts
shooting across this table here.

25:25.456 --> 25:26.456
And you know you can't deny it.

25:29.456 --> 25:31.457
You're coming on a little strong.

25:34.455 --> 25:35.456
I know you're trying to
protect yourself.

25:39.456 --> 25:41.457
Just give me a chance
to prove you're wrong.

25:43.457 --> 25:46.458
I'm sure I don't know
quite what you're talking about.

25:50.457 --> 25:50.457
Good.

25:55.457 --> 25:56.458
Good.

25:57.458 --> 25:57.458
Good.

26:01.459 --> 26:02.457
Sorry.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.459
- You Phillip?
- Yes.

26:35.459 --> 26:36.459
Hi, Phillip.

26:36.459 --> 26:39.460
I hope your new place is nice,
nice enough anyway.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.460
I hope the chocolate
made it to you okay.

26:42.460 --> 26:43.460
Check the T.P.

26:51.460 --> 26:54.460
I hope you try to make
some new friends and not be too shy.

26:54.460 --> 26:57.461
I guess I should tell you
a little bit about myself.

26:57.461 --> 26:58.461
Dear Steven.

26:58.461 --> 27:00.462
I keep thinking about you
saying I'm shy.

27:01.460 --> 27:02.461
I guess you're right.

27:02.461 --> 27:04.461
But I don't feel shy around you.

27:04.461 --> 27:06.461
I, I think that means somethin'.

27:06.461 --> 27:08.461
Anyway, thanks for the chocolate,
but I, I should tell ya,

27:09.460 --> 27:10.461
I, I'm diabetic.

27:10.461 --> 27:12.461
So I... probably shouldn't.
But I did anyway.

27:12.461 --> 27:15.462
Debbie and Stephie mean the world to me.

27:15.462 --> 27:17.462
I don't think I would have made it
this far without them.

27:17.462 --> 27:20.462
They're all that keeps me goin'.
Well they were.

27:21.462 --> 27:23.462
Steven, I wanna hear more about
your time in Virginia Beach.

27:23.462 --> 27:25.463
Have you been to
the Smithsonian Museum?

27:25.463 --> 27:26.462
- I love those old movies.
- I hear they have Archie...

27:26.462 --> 27:27.463
Bunker's chair there.

27:27.463 --> 27:28.462
I bet if I try I can
get them to show one here.

27:28.462 --> 27:29.463
But there'd probably be a riot

27:29.463 --> 27:31.462
if you showed something
in black and white.

27:31.462 --> 27:33.462
But it wouldn't be much fun
without you anyway.

27:33.462 --> 27:35.462
Do you like the top or the bottom?

27:35.462 --> 27:36.462
I like both, I guess.

27:36.462 --> 27:37.462
What bunk do you like?

27:37.462 --> 27:39.462
Sometimes I feel
I could fill an encyclopedia

27:39.462 --> 27:40.463
with all the stuff I know.

27:40.463 --> 27:42.463
It's been so long since
anyone's shown me any kindness

27:43.462 --> 27:45.462
and well, it, it means a lot.

27:46.463 --> 27:47.463
And I just wish you were here.

27:47.463 --> 27:50.463
Write me back soon.
Love, Phillip.

27:57.465 --> 27:59.465
Oh, come on, Cleavon!

28:00.463 --> 28:03.463
I ain't no motherfuckin' DHL faggot.

28:03.463 --> 28:06.463
Besides, I ain't got nothin'
for you anyway.

28:07.464 --> 28:08.463
But it's been three days.

28:08.463 --> 28:11.464
You got a tracking number
motherfucker, huh?

28:13.464 --> 28:14.465
No.

28:14.465 --> 28:17.465
Then shut your faggot ass.

28:32.464 --> 28:33.465
Oh, my God.

28:34.465 --> 28:35.465
How did you do this?

28:36.465 --> 28:38.465
I know a guy. He took care of it.

28:42.465 --> 28:44.466
I'm gonna take care of everything.

28:49.467 --> 28:51.467
Enough romance. Let's fuck.

28:54.468 --> 28:56.467
Oh. Shit, girl.

28:57.466 --> 28:59.467
Don't bite, don't bite.

29:04.467 --> 29:06.467
Phillip. What the fuck?

29:07.466 --> 29:09.467
And then I was executive assistant...

29:10.467 --> 29:12.467
- to a Broadway producer.
- Really.

29:14.468 --> 29:17.468
What would a Broadway producer
be doing in Atlanta?

29:19.468 --> 29:20.468
I didn't ask.

29:23.468 --> 29:24.467
What were you doing for him?

29:25.468 --> 29:29.467
I just road around town in his limo
drinking and sucking him off.

29:29.467 --> 29:30.469
Oh.

29:31.468 --> 29:33.468
Yeah, but he was a nice guy.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.469
I only dated him a little while anyway.

29:36.469 --> 29:39.468
Then I dated this full-blooded Apache.

29:39.468 --> 29:41.469
He used to make me
dress up as a baseball player.

29:42.469 --> 29:44.469
- What was his name?
- Melvin.

29:45.469 --> 29:48.469
Phillip. You amaze me.

29:48.469 --> 29:50.469
What? He was a nice guy, too.

29:51.470 --> 29:53.470
That's what I'm sayin'.

29:54.469 --> 29:55.470
You always see the good.

29:58.470 --> 29:59.470
What the hell is that?

29:59.470 --> 30:01.470
That is the Screecher next door.

30:02.469 --> 30:03.470
He does that all night.

30:03.470 --> 30:06.470
I swear to God
I don't get any sleep ever.

30:06.470 --> 30:08.471
- Drives me fuckin' crazy.
- Oh, man.

30:21.470 --> 30:22.471
Shut the fuck up!

30:25.471 --> 30:26.471
Shut up!

30:35.472 --> 30:39.472
I thank you not to screech, bitch!

30:39.472 --> 30:40.471
What does he care?

30:40.471 --> 30:42.471
He isn't in our block.

30:42.471 --> 30:44.471
Somebody probably paid him.

30:44.471 --> 30:46.472
I said shut the hell up!

30:46.472 --> 30:48.473
Knock it off!

31:08.472 --> 31:09.473
Get up.

31:12.473 --> 31:14.473
Did you pay to have
the Screecher beat up?

31:15.474 --> 31:16.473
- Me?
- Don't bullshit me.

31:17.474 --> 31:18.473
Did you pay to have him beat up?

31:20.474 --> 31:21.474
You hate that guy.

31:21.474 --> 31:23.474
Just answer the question.

31:32.475 --> 31:34.474
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

31:38.474 --> 31:39.474
Steven.

31:44.475 --> 31:47.476
That is the most romantic thing
that anyone ever did for me.

31:50.475 --> 31:51.476
I love you so much.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.476
I just want you to be happy, baby.

31:55.476 --> 31:58.476
You are my true soul mate.

31:59.477 --> 32:00.474
You're cutting of my air.

32:10.476 --> 32:13.476
Cleavon. Put this in.

32:14.477 --> 32:16.477
Not now, man. I'm fuckin' busy.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.477
- It's important.
- How important?

32:22.478 --> 32:24.478
- Here.
- Ten.

32:31.477 --> 32:32.476
You gotta play the whole thing.

32:32.476 --> 32:33.477
All right, all right, all right.

32:34.477 --> 32:37.477
- Here. Promise.
- Fuck you. Fuck you, man.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.478
My word is my motherfuckin' bond.

32:39.478 --> 32:40.478
Fuck you.

33:08.479 --> 33:09.480
What is your problem?

33:10.479 --> 33:12.479
I wanna dance with you.

33:14.479 --> 33:16.480
I don't wanna dance, baby.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.481
Come on, Steve. I wanna dance.

33:21.480 --> 33:22.480
I'm kinda into this.

33:23.480 --> 33:26.481
Steven, dance with me. Come on.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.480
Okay. You're a pest, you know that?

34:04.482 --> 34:06.482
You fucking bitch.

34:20.483 --> 34:21.483
Oh, you.

34:38.484 --> 34:39.483
Lights out.

34:41.483 --> 34:43.484
Cleavon, lights out means no music.

34:43.484 --> 34:44.484
Turn it off.

34:46.484 --> 34:49.484
- I said turn it off.
- Fuck you pig.

34:49.484 --> 34:51.484
Turn it off or we're coming in.

34:51.484 --> 34:52.485
Come on in.

34:52.485 --> 34:54.485
I got a dick that needs suckin'.

34:54.485 --> 34:55.485
I'll kick your fuckin' ass.

34:55.485 --> 34:57.486
Fuck you, man. My fuckin' word...

34:57.486 --> 34:59.485
is my motherfuckin' bond!

34:59.485 --> 35:00.485
Goddamn it, come on!

35:00.485 --> 35:02.485
My word's my bond, motherfucker.

35:02.485 --> 35:03.485
Open it!

35:07.485 --> 35:09.485
- Turn it off!
- Fuck you!

35:09.485 --> 35:11.485
- Turn it off.
- Fuck you, you asshole, you bitch.

35:11.485 --> 35:13.485
Turn it off or we're coming in.

35:13.485 --> 35:15.486
- Fuck you! Fuck you, bitch!
- Goddamn it.

35:15.486 --> 35:19.486
- Get the fuck... Shut up.
- I'll drag your sorry ass...

35:19.486 --> 35:21.486
Your motherfuckin'...

35:24.487 --> 35:26.487
My word is my bond, bitch!

35:44.487 --> 35:46.487
Russell. Get up. Let's go.

35:46.487 --> 35:47.488
What? What's happening?

35:47.488 --> 35:48.487
You're transferred.

35:48.487 --> 35:49.488
Lonnie snitched you out
about the Screech.

35:49.488 --> 35:50.488
You're going to Grandview Two.

35:51.488 --> 35:52.489
- What? I thought the... No.
- Come on, get up.

35:52.489 --> 35:53.488
I said, come on, let's go. Get up.

35:53.488 --> 35:54.489
Hey, wait a minute.

35:54.489 --> 35:54.489
Sit down, bitch.

35:55.488 --> 35:56.489
Hey, don't touch him like that!

35:56.489 --> 35:58.487
- Steven!
- Don't worry Phillip.

35:58.487 --> 35:59.487
I'll take care of this.

35:59.487 --> 36:01.487
You ain't gonna take care of shit.

36:01.487 --> 36:02.488
Don't worry!

36:14.489 --> 36:15.489
Steven!

36:42.490 --> 36:42.490
Steven!

36:46.491 --> 36:47.490
Steven!

37:09.492 --> 37:09.492
I wanna go in the yard.

37:10.492 --> 37:12.492
- You do?
- I wanna go in the yard!

37:12.492 --> 37:14.492
Hold on, I was just doggin'.

37:32.492 --> 37:33.493
Steven!

37:39.493 --> 37:41.494
What the hell are you doin'?

37:41.494 --> 37:43.493
I love you!

37:45.493 --> 37:46.493
I love you, too.

37:49.493 --> 37:50.494
We'll be together soon!

37:51.494 --> 37:52.494
I promise!

37:54.494 --> 37:55.494
I promise!

37:57.493 --> 38:02.494
I love you, Phillip Morris! I love you!

38:17.495 --> 38:20.495
Those were the longest
three months of my life.

38:22.495 --> 38:25.496
I wrote Phillip every day
until I got released.

38:26.496 --> 38:31.495
And once I did, I was determined to get
us back together as soon as possible.

38:31.495 --> 38:32.496
Hi, how are you?

38:33.496 --> 38:35.496
Yeah, well. Where're you headin'?
Greyhound?

38:35.496 --> 38:37.495
The nearest thrift store, please.

38:37.495 --> 38:41.495
Well, good. Do you mind if I tell you
the word of our Lord Jesus Christ?

38:42.496 --> 38:45.497
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life

38:46.496 --> 38:48.496
and I shall dwell in the House
of the Lord forever.

38:48.496 --> 38:51.497
For the Kingdom is the Lord's.
He's the governor.

38:57.498 --> 39:00.497
I will declare thy name
unto my brothers.

39:00.497 --> 39:03.496
Keep my soul and deliver me.

39:03.496 --> 39:07.497
Let me not be ashamed
if I put my trust in Thee.

39:07.497 --> 39:10.498
Wow.
That was inspiring. Thanks.

39:17.498 --> 39:19.498
You said you'd get here quick,
but, Jesus.

39:19.498 --> 39:23.499
I got a lot of work to do, honey.
I'm getting you outta here early.

39:23.499 --> 39:26.499
I got a hearing in the morning.
I got motions to file.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.498
The law don't sleep, baby.

39:30.498 --> 39:31.498
I love you so much.

39:32.498 --> 39:32.498
Phillip...

39:32.498 --> 39:35.498
you are the sweetest,
most gentle man I have ever known.

39:36.498 --> 39:39.499
And I know people
have taken advantage of that.

39:39.499 --> 39:41.499
I wanna protect you.

39:41.499 --> 39:43.499
I wanna make a life with you,
Phillip.

39:45.499 --> 39:47.500
Get me outta here.

39:52.501 --> 39:54.501
The motion was filed.

39:54.501 --> 39:57.499
I presented it to the D.A.
And got a letter from the judge.

39:57.499 --> 40:00.499
I do not understand
what the holdup is.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.500
Now, I am not some paralegal.
I am Steven fucking Russo.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.500
And I expect proper adjudication.

40:13.501 --> 40:15.501
My boyfriend's
getting out of prison next week.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.502
That'll be two-ninety-nine.

40:30.501 --> 40:32.501
I have an early release order
for Phillip Morris.

40:32.501 --> 40:34.502
Uh-huh. Morris.

40:34.502 --> 40:37.501
We got him right here waiting.
And you are?

40:37.501 --> 40:38.502
I'm his lawyer.

40:53.503 --> 40:55.503
Look at you!

40:57.502 --> 40:58.503
Look at you.

40:59.503 --> 41:00.503
You're incredible.

41:01.503 --> 41:02.503
Yeah, I know.

41:17.504 --> 41:17.504
Oh, thank you.

41:17.504 --> 41:18.504
We're gonna need a bigger place.

41:18.504 --> 41:21.505
Steve, I want you
to meet my old neighbor, Eudora Mixon.

41:21.505 --> 41:22.504
Eudora.

41:22.504 --> 41:23.505
Pleasure, Steven.

41:24.504 --> 41:26.505
Steve, Eudora owns a little building
down in Montrose and...

41:26.505 --> 41:28.504
she's having terrible trouble
with her builder.

41:28.504 --> 41:30.504
His plans were useless.

41:30.504 --> 41:32.504
And now he's trying to
sue me to pay him.

41:32.504 --> 41:34.504
Phillip says maybe you can help.

41:34.504 --> 41:35.505
Well, I could sure try.

41:35.505 --> 41:38.506
Can you still
practice law having been to prison?

41:39.505 --> 41:41.505
Sure. Why not?

41:43.505 --> 41:44.505
Oh. Well, I just...

41:46.506 --> 41:51.506
I'd just be glad to have someone
I could trust. I'll pay your normal fee.

41:52.506 --> 41:56.505
Well, it would be my pleasure.
Litigation's my specialty.

41:58.506 --> 41:59.506
I told you he'd help you.

42:06.506 --> 42:08.506
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

42:12.506 --> 42:13.507
Oh, yes.

42:23.508 --> 42:29.507
Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged
Mr. Yoakum's service in good faith

42:29.507 --> 42:31.507
and was given an inferior product.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.507
She is entitled to deem
that work to be unacceptable

42:34.507 --> 42:37.508
according to the contract
Mr. Yoakum signed.

42:37.508 --> 42:40.508
The terms of that contract
were ambiguous at best.

42:40.508 --> 42:44.508
Truth is, defendant engaged my client
for three years without full payment.

42:52.509 --> 42:55.510
Your Honor, I have in my briefcase
fourteen other contracts,

42:55.510 --> 42:57.509
all on public record,

42:57.509 --> 43:01.508
in which Mr. Yoakum entered into
litigation with past clients of his.

43:02.509 --> 43:03.508
Oh, my goodness.

43:07.509 --> 43:09.509
Yeah-heh-yeah.

43:15.511 --> 43:15.511
Your Honor...

43:16.510 --> 43:20.511
I don't have to tell you that none of
this is admissible or even applicable...

43:20.511 --> 43:22.511
and Mr. Russell's histrionics here
hardly erase the fact

43:23.511 --> 43:25.512
that his client is
in breach of contract.

43:27.510 --> 43:29.510
Yeah. You wish.

43:29.510 --> 43:30.510
He's right, Mr. Russell.

43:30.510 --> 43:32.511
What do you have to say?

43:48.512 --> 43:49.512
I demand to be seen in chambers.

44:05.512 --> 44:07.513
All right, gentlemen.
Let's get this over with.

44:08.512 --> 44:10.513
Two for one at the Crab Boil ends
at five o'clock.

44:11.513 --> 44:13.513
It seems pretty cut
and dry to me, sir.

44:13.513 --> 44:14.514
I don't even know
why we're back here.

44:14.514 --> 44:16.514
Mr. Russell's treating this like
an episode on Matlock.

44:18.514 --> 44:21.513
I will admit, Your Honor,
I'm a plainspoken man.

44:21.513 --> 44:24.514
I didn't go to Princeton.
I didn't go to Yale.

44:24.514 --> 44:26.513
My education was modest.

44:27.513 --> 44:28.513
I went to a small school.

44:29.514 --> 44:30.513
Grew up on a small farm.

44:31.514 --> 44:34.514
But I passed the same bar exam
as my colleague here.

44:35.514 --> 44:38.514
And I'm not gonna let him push
around that humble woman.

44:38.514 --> 44:39.515
Come on.

44:42.514 --> 44:43.515
Point taken...

44:45.515 --> 44:46.514
Mr. Russell.

44:49.515 --> 44:51.515
But where are you going with this?

44:55.514 --> 44:58.515
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
where I'm going with this, sir.

45:23.517 --> 45:24.515
Are you talking...

45:24.515 --> 45:26.518
Marshall versus Chow?

45:28.517 --> 45:30.517
Oh... shit.

45:30.517 --> 45:34.517
Your Honor, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

45:34.517 --> 45:37.517
Yes! I did great!

45:37.517 --> 45:39.516
I mean, can you believe
how great I did?

45:41.517 --> 45:41.517
- Really great!
- Yes.

45:42.517 --> 45:43.517
I mean, seriously.

45:43.517 --> 45:45.518
Now, let's go out. I'm payin'.

45:45.518 --> 45:46.518
Oh.

45:46.518 --> 45:46.518
Great!

45:46.518 --> 45:49.518
Right this way.
Do not open your eyes,

45:49.518 --> 45:50.518
- little cheater.
- All right. I won't.

45:50.518 --> 45:51.518
- You cheater.
- I, I did not.

45:51.518 --> 45:52.518
- Don't open 'em.
- Tell me when.

45:52.518 --> 45:54.518
- Don't ruin the surprise.
- Tell me when.

45:54.518 --> 45:58.518
Okay. Here we go. Right now.

45:59.518 --> 46:01.518
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

46:01.518 --> 46:04.519
You like it? Oh, I'm so relieved.

46:04.519 --> 46:05.518
Can we afford this?

46:05.518 --> 46:07.518
You just let me worry about
the money, honey.

46:08.519 --> 46:10.519
Okay, well, I guess I better
start packing boxes.

46:10.519 --> 46:12.519
Not this week.

46:12.519 --> 46:13.519
Why not?

46:13.519 --> 46:15.519
Because I think we both deserve
a vacation in Key West.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.519
You are getting good at that.

46:36.519 --> 46:38.519
Oh, you don't love me.

46:44.521 --> 46:46.521
With Phillip I felt strong.

46:47.521 --> 46:50.522
I felt invincible. I promised myself...

46:50.522 --> 46:53.521
that he would never want for
anything ever again.

46:54.522 --> 46:58.520
That meant I needed a real job.
Something dependable.

46:59.520 --> 47:00.521
And no more scams.

47:10.522 --> 47:16.522
We have ignition sequence start.
There it goes. Five, four, three, two.

47:18.522 --> 47:20.523
Steven,
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

47:20.523 --> 47:21.523
Dan Lindholm.

47:21.523 --> 47:22.524
Dan.

47:22.524 --> 47:22.524
How are ya?

47:22.524 --> 47:23.523
Good.

47:23.523 --> 47:25.521
Are you a space man, Dan?

47:25.521 --> 47:28.522
Uh... yeah. I mean,
I never did get out there though.

47:28.522 --> 47:31.522
And NASA's a real political place.
I never could quite figure out

47:31.522 --> 47:33.522
whose ass to kiss and get a mission.

47:33.522 --> 47:35.522
Well, that's all in the past now.

47:35.522 --> 47:37.523
Barely even think about it now.
Come on inside.

47:38.523 --> 47:43.524
Space man, huh?
How do you crap up there?

47:44.524 --> 47:47.525
Ass gasket. Have a seat.

47:47.525 --> 47:49.525
All right. A little bit about you.

47:49.525 --> 47:51.524
Steven Russell.

47:51.524 --> 47:54.523
When I first read your resume, well,
I didn't quite know what to think.

47:55.523 --> 47:56.523
I mean, your level of experience

47:56.523 --> 47:58.524
and your prior education,
all gonna factor...

47:58.524 --> 48:00.524
heavily into my decision and well...

48:02.525 --> 48:06.525
Frankly, you're head
and shoulders above the rest.

48:06.525 --> 48:08.525
I mean, I could hardly believe it.

48:08.525 --> 48:09.525
When I called all your references,

48:09.525 --> 48:11.525
well, they couldn't speak
more highly of ya.

48:11.525 --> 48:14.526
I cannot speak more highly about
Steven Russell, Mr. Lindholm.

48:14.526 --> 48:16.526
He's a real straight-shooter.

48:16.526 --> 48:18.525
We were damn lucky to have him
here at Prudential as long as we did.

48:19.526 --> 48:20.525
Employee of the Year
two years running.

48:21.526 --> 48:23.526
Developing software for IBM.

48:24.526 --> 48:25.525
You...

48:25.525 --> 48:27.525
you're the kind of person
we need here, Steven.

48:28.525 --> 48:29.526
We want you.

48:29.526 --> 48:31.526
We want you to be
our Chief Financial Officer.

48:33.526 --> 48:34.526
I pulled all the claims...

48:34.526 --> 48:35.526
from the last two years along
with the statements,

48:35.526 --> 48:37.526
transfers and confirmations
from the bank.

48:38.527 --> 48:38.527
Most of it's routine

48:38.527 --> 48:41.527
and I think you can get up
to speed in a day or two.

48:41.527 --> 48:42.527
Anything else
I can do for you?

48:44.527 --> 48:47.526
Uh, coffee?

48:47.526 --> 48:51.527
I'll do that today.
But I don't do that really.

49:18.529 --> 49:21.529
Crossover from traditional markets
shows declination

49:21.529 --> 49:26.529
and inverse diffusion seems
commensurate with that trade trending.

49:26.529 --> 49:30.529
Uh, HMO penetrations still eats PPO,
NMO and FMO as usual.

49:30.529 --> 49:34.529
But attenuation is growing
more prevalent in QFour as projected.

49:34.529 --> 49:39.529
Now, as for Q-Three, well,
Q-Three is what Q-Three always is.

49:39.529 --> 49:41.530
It's Q-Two with training wheels.

49:44.529 --> 49:46.529
Score. Whoo.

49:46.529 --> 49:48.530
Okay, Steven. You're turn.

49:50.530 --> 49:52.530
Now, I know you've only had
the one quarter to play catch-up...

49:52.530 --> 49:56.530
but I tell ya, we can't wait for
some insight here.

49:57.530 --> 50:06.530
Oh? Okay. You know, um,
I did a lot of work on this.

50:06.530 --> 50:10.531
And, uh, I think maybe...

50:19.532 --> 50:22.532
Why don't I just show it to you?
Todd?

50:23.533 --> 50:25.532
My new assistant Todd, everybody.

50:26.531 --> 50:29.531
Now, if we take a look at
Mark's projections again for Q-Three.

50:29.531 --> 50:34.532
We'll see, well, we'll see
they're just that. Projections.

50:34.532 --> 50:37.532
Projections based on a model
set by my predecessor.

50:39.532 --> 50:41.532
I decided to reject that model.

50:41.532 --> 50:42.533
Do things a little differently.

50:43.532 --> 50:44.533
I wanna show you my results.

50:47.533 --> 50:50.534
This is what
we actually made in Q-Three.

50:55.535 --> 50:57.533
Now I wanna tell you how I did it.

50:58.532 --> 50:59.533
Todd, can you get me coffee?

51:00.533 --> 51:01.533
Anybody else want coffee?

51:16.535 --> 51:17.535
Steven?

51:18.535 --> 51:19.535
We've got a problem.

51:21.535 --> 51:22.535
What's that?

51:22.535 --> 51:23.533
Real important question.

51:26.534 --> 51:27.534
Do you play golf?

51:30.534 --> 51:31.535
Yeah.

51:31.535 --> 51:33.535
All right.
I'll kick your ass next week.

51:33.535 --> 51:35.535
All right.

51:51.536 --> 51:52.537
Golf?

51:52.537 --> 51:53.535
What?

51:53.535 --> 51:54.536
You're a homosexual.

51:55.535 --> 51:56.536
It's for work.

51:56.536 --> 51:59.536
You know, you can tell them.
They can't fire you for being gay.

51:59.536 --> 52:00.536
I know that.

52:00.536 --> 52:02.537
I'm trying to be
understanding here, honey.

52:06.537 --> 52:07.537
Wish me luck.

52:08.537 --> 52:09.538
Good luck.

52:10.537 --> 52:12.537
Oh! Fuck me with a flaming fist!

52:12.537 --> 52:16.537
It's a hell of a hazard, hey, Steven?
It's all right. That's four. Five.

52:17.537 --> 52:18.537
Eat my asshole.

52:18.537 --> 52:20.537
Take your time.
Take a slow backswing.

52:20.537 --> 52:21.538
Oh, fuck!

52:21.538 --> 52:22.536
Six.

52:22.536 --> 52:23.537
Shit.

52:23.537 --> 52:24.537
I ain't making you nervous, am I?

52:24.537 --> 52:27.537
God awful whore cocksucker!

52:27.537 --> 52:29.538
You can quit after nine.

52:29.538 --> 52:31.538
Take this, you little twat!

52:31.538 --> 52:32.538
There you go.

52:36.539 --> 52:37.538
Pardon my French.

52:38.539 --> 52:40.539
My mother smoked
during pregnancy.

53:34.540 --> 53:36.541
The tux, what's the occasion?

53:36.541 --> 53:39.541
Just some work thing.
Were we supposed to...?

53:39.541 --> 53:42.541
No, no, it's fine.
Where're you goin'?

53:42.541 --> 53:44.542
Just some gala ball thing.

53:44.542 --> 53:47.542
A gala ball thing. Sounds boring.

53:47.542 --> 53:50.543
Yeah. I'll be home early. Promise.

53:51.542 --> 53:52.543
All right.

54:01.541 --> 54:03.543
Hey, Belle, honey, ladies.

54:03.543 --> 54:07.543
Hi. I want you to meet
Steven Russell, our CFO.

54:07.543 --> 54:08.543
Love your dress.

54:08.543 --> 54:10.543
Well, I heard about you.

54:10.543 --> 54:12.543
We're real proud of him.
Real proud.

54:12.543 --> 54:13.544
Are you married, Steven?

54:14.543 --> 54:16.543
Uh, engaged.

54:16.543 --> 54:18.544
Well... where is she, sweetheart?

54:19.544 --> 54:20.544
She works.

54:20.544 --> 54:21.544
Oh.

54:21.544 --> 54:23.545
Well, let's grab a drink.

54:23.545 --> 54:23.545
Okay.

54:24.544 --> 54:24.544
So nice to meet you.

54:24.544 --> 54:26.544
So nice to meet you.

54:28.543 --> 54:30.544
These are for Dan.

54:30.544 --> 54:32.544
Thanks, Steven. You doing good?

54:33.543 --> 54:36.544
Kinda. Just got back
from a lawyer's office.

54:36.544 --> 54:37.544
I asked him, what's your fee?

54:37.544 --> 54:40.545
He says he charges fifty dollars
for three questions.

54:40.545 --> 54:42.545
So I asked him, don't you think
that's a little expensive?

54:43.545 --> 54:46.545
He says, yes it is.
Now, what's your final question?

54:49.546 --> 54:51.546
Oh, that's so true. Lawyers.

54:52.546 --> 54:52.546
Can't trust 'em.

54:52.546 --> 54:53.545
Unh-uh.

54:54.544 --> 54:55.545
Oh, Annie. You've gotta hear this.

54:56.544 --> 54:58.544
There's this lawyer
with three questions.

54:58.544 --> 55:02.546
And then,
so the lawyer says, well, yes,

55:02.546 --> 55:04.546
and now you've
only one question left.

55:05.546 --> 55:07.546
'Cause he already asked two.

55:07.546 --> 55:08.546
Yeah.

55:08.546 --> 55:09.546
So the Northrop guy says,

55:09.546 --> 55:12.547
that question's gonna cost you
fifty million dollars.

55:12.547 --> 55:14.547
And the NASA guy says,
fifty million?

55:14.547 --> 55:15.546
Don't you think
that's a lot of money?

55:15.546 --> 55:18.547
And the Northrop guy says,
yep, that's another fifty million.

55:18.547 --> 55:19.548
You got anymore questions?

55:20.546 --> 55:21.547
Ha.

55:22.546 --> 55:26.546
So, this black fella says to
the Jew lawyer, fifty bucks a question.

55:26.546 --> 55:28.546
Man, ain't that expensive?

55:28.546 --> 55:31.547
Yeah, it's expensive, he says.
I'm a Jew, you nigga!

55:33.547 --> 55:34.547
I'm up on the left.

55:37.548 --> 55:39.548
Fucking moron.

55:39.548 --> 55:45.548
Now, maybe it was just my nature,
or maybe it was because of my past,

55:46.548 --> 55:47.548
or maybe it was because they were

55:47.548 --> 55:50.548
the most boring fuckin' people
I'd ever met in my life.

55:52.549 --> 55:54.548
But whatever the reason,

55:54.548 --> 55:56.548
I had been robbing them
blind for months.

56:01.549 --> 56:03.549
USAMM is
a medical management company.

56:03.549 --> 56:07.549
It takes in all this HMO money
and distributes it to doctors.

56:08.549 --> 56:11.550
But in the time between receiving
the money and paying it out,

56:12.549 --> 56:15.549
it's just sitting there,
not making interest or anything.

56:16.549 --> 56:19.550
So, it occurred to me to
set up an investment account

56:19.550 --> 56:22.549
where the held money would earn
interest for the short time we had it.

56:23.549 --> 56:27.549
We're talking twenty-two
million dollars at any given time.

56:27.549 --> 56:30.550
So, even short-term,
the interest adds up pretty quickly.

56:31.550 --> 56:32.550
Oh, Annie, you've gotta hear this.

56:32.550 --> 56:34.551
I've been making the company millions.

56:34.551 --> 56:35.551
Virtually overnight.

56:36.551 --> 56:41.551
And, of course, I would take
a commission, say fifty percent.

56:43.551 --> 56:47.551
Me and Phillip were finally able to
start living the life we always wanted,

56:47.551 --> 56:49.552
the life we deserved.

56:51.552 --> 56:53.551
How big was this Christmas bonus?

56:53.551 --> 56:54.551
Pretty big.

56:55.551 --> 56:56.552
In July?

56:56.552 --> 56:58.552
Yeah, I thought it was weird, too.

57:01.552 --> 57:02.552
Oh, look.

57:03.552 --> 57:07.551
- What are we gonna do with those?
- Oh, Steven. They got our names on.

57:21.554 --> 57:22.552
Larry!

57:41.553 --> 57:42.554
Nice car.

57:43.554 --> 57:44.554
Thank you, Larry.

57:45.554 --> 57:45.554
Which one is that?

57:46.554 --> 57:51.555
- It's, uh, the SL. Driving the C?
- Yeah.

57:51.555 --> 57:52.554
- Hmm. Good car.
- Uh-huh.

57:52.554 --> 57:54.554
Good value.

58:33.556 --> 58:34.556
So the sheriff pulls over...

58:34.556 --> 58:37.557
and he finds
the missing car all wrecked

58:37.557 --> 58:39.557
and rolled over and
the girl inside and still alive.

58:39.557 --> 58:40.557
No.

58:40.557 --> 58:40.557
I swear to God.

58:41.557 --> 58:43.557
That's in the Ricky Martin People
in the bathroom.

58:43.557 --> 58:44.557
Oh. Must be true.

58:44.557 --> 58:48.557
Yeah. They can find out
all sorts of stuff, those people.

58:49.558 --> 58:50.559
Uh-huh.

58:50.559 --> 58:52.557
They can find out anything
about anyone.

58:53.556 --> 58:58.557
Phillip. What is it?

59:02.558 --> 59:03.557
It's just...

59:06.558 --> 59:08.558
Is something going on?

59:09.559 --> 59:11.559
Something you're not
telling me about?

59:12.559 --> 59:13.559
No.

59:14.559 --> 59:16.559
'Cause if there is, stop it now.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.559
There isn't. There's nothing.

59:20.557 --> 59:21.558
I don't care about the money.

59:22.558 --> 59:27.559
All I want is you.
I just want us to be together.

59:28.559 --> 59:30.559
We're always gonna be together.

59:30.559 --> 59:32.560
And there's nothing going on.

59:33.559 --> 59:34.560
I promise.

59:36.560 --> 59:38.560
I would never lie to you, baby.

59:44.560 --> 59:46.560
Yeah, I've got some questions about
these new accounts that we've opened.

59:47.560 --> 59:50.559
Uh-huh. I'd like to compare
some numbers if we could.

59:50.559 --> 59:53.560
And, listen, I know you normally
talk to our financial officer,

59:53.560 --> 59:55.560
Steven Russell about this.
But, uh...

01:00:38.562 --> 01:00:41.563
You've reached the automatic
teller at Alamo Citizens Bank.

01:00:41.563 --> 01:00:43.563
Please enter your personal
account number.

01:00:44.563 --> 01:00:48.564
Accessing account for Steven Russell.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:54.563
Your account balance is eight hundred
thirty-seven thousand five...

01:01:17.565 --> 01:01:18.565
Hello.

01:01:18.565 --> 01:01:18.565
Hey, Debbie.

01:01:19.565 --> 01:01:20.564
Hey, Steven. How are you?

01:01:20.564 --> 01:01:22.564
Good. How's Stephie doing?

01:01:22.564 --> 01:01:24.565
She's good, real good.

01:01:24.565 --> 01:01:26.566
- Good.
- She sure is her father's daughter.

01:01:26.566 --> 01:01:28.566
Interested in boys already?

01:01:28.566 --> 01:01:29.565
Ha-ha.

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:29.565
Ha-ha.

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:30.565
How's Phillip?

01:01:30.565 --> 01:01:32.565
He says hello. Listen.

01:01:32.565 --> 01:01:35.565
Um, I just wanted to let you know
that I'm changing all my numbers.

01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:37.565
I'll let you know
when I get a new one.

01:01:37.565 --> 01:01:38.566
You on the lam again?

01:01:39.565 --> 01:01:41.566
Deb, you always knew me best.

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:43.567
You really should stop this.

01:01:43.567 --> 01:01:43.567
I know.

01:01:44.566 --> 01:01:45.567
You're such a good man.

01:01:45.567 --> 01:01:46.566
You're right.

01:01:46.566 --> 01:01:48.567
And Jesus has a plan for you.

01:01:48.567 --> 01:01:49.567
Well, maybe this is his plan.

01:01:50.567 --> 01:01:52.566
Maybe He was like a mean
little boy with a magnifying glass

01:01:52.566 --> 01:01:54.566
and I'm just the defenseless little ant.

01:01:55.567 --> 01:01:57.566
Oh, that's Jesus on the other line.
I gotta go.

01:01:58.566 --> 01:01:59.566
- Stop it.
- I love you both, call you soon.

01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:01.566
Love you, too.

01:02:02.567 --> 01:02:02.567
Hello?

01:02:03.567 --> 01:02:06.567
Hey, Steven. Where are ya?

01:02:06.567 --> 01:02:08.568
Gulf Freeway. Where are you?

01:02:08.568 --> 01:02:09.567
I'm at the office.

01:02:09.567 --> 01:02:12.568
Hey, uh, uh, you,
you coming back anytime soon?

01:02:12.568 --> 01:02:14.568
No, I don't think
I'm coming back in.

01:02:14.568 --> 01:02:16.568
I think we both know why.

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:18.569
Bye-bye, Dan.

01:02:33.568 --> 01:02:34.568
People keep calling.
What's going on?

01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:37.569
Nothin.' Thought
we'd take a little vacation.

01:02:37.569 --> 01:02:40.570
Key West.
Let's pack. Quick.

01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:43.569
Okay, I'll pack for you.

01:02:43.569 --> 01:02:44.570
I fuckin' knew it.

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.570
You did somethin'.
You lied to me.

01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:48.570
You looked me right in the eye
and you lied.

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.568
Don't get mad. It'll be fine, I swear.

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:53.568
You're going back to prison,
Steven?

01:02:53.568 --> 01:02:55.569
You promised me
we'd always be together.

01:02:55.569 --> 01:02:58.569
And I'm keeping that promise.
We'll never be apart. Never.

01:02:58.569 --> 01:02:59.570
Why do I never learn?

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:02.570
And why did I listen to you?
You son of a bitch!

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.570
We'll get a house.
Do some fishing.

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:06.570
I can work on my key lime pie recipe.

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:08.570
Hey, maybe I'll go a beard.

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:10.570
Enter the Papa Hemingway contest.

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:11.571
Honey?

01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:13.571
Honey?

01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:18.571
Phillip? Honey?
It's gonna be easy. You'll see.

01:03:19.571 --> 01:03:22.571
Phillip! Phillip, come back here!

01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:25.570
Phillip.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.571
You have got to trust me.

01:03:34.572 --> 01:03:35.571
Don't move!

01:03:36.572 --> 01:03:39.573
No. Get away from me.
Get away from me!

01:03:39.573 --> 01:03:40.572
No.

01:03:40.572 --> 01:03:41.573
No!

01:03:41.573 --> 01:03:45.572
There I was again,
keeping secrets, living a lie.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:46.572
Calm down.

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:46.572
Fuck you!

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:48.572
Calm down!

01:03:48.572 --> 01:03:50.571
Calm you fuckin' down.

01:03:50.571 --> 01:03:51.572
Stop it, calm down.

01:03:51.572 --> 01:03:56.573
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Like I said, I tend to do that.

01:03:57.572 --> 01:03:59.573
No, I didn't blame Phillip
for running out on me.

01:03:59.573 --> 01:04:01.573
But I had to get him back.

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:04.574
You see, there's something
I didn't tell you.

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.574
It's about my old boyfriend,
Jimmy.

01:04:06.574 --> 01:04:10.573
A long time ago,
when I was waiting to go to prison...

01:04:11.573 --> 01:04:12.573
I made him a promise.

01:04:15.574 --> 01:04:18.574
Come on.
You gotta drink something.

01:04:22.573 --> 01:04:24.574
I want you to have this.

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.574
'Cause I'm gonna be leaving soon.

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:40.575
You can't leave.

01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:45.575
I need you around here.

01:04:46.576 --> 01:04:47.575
You're the love of my life.

01:04:49.574 --> 01:04:51.575
You're sweet.

01:04:52.575 --> 01:04:54.575
But, no, I'm not.

01:04:54.575 --> 01:04:55.576
Sh.

01:04:55.576 --> 01:04:55.576
I'm not.

01:04:56.576 --> 01:04:57.576
Oh, come on.

01:04:58.576 --> 01:05:00.576
I've seen him.

01:05:00.576 --> 01:05:01.576
Oh, yeah.

01:05:01.576 --> 01:05:03.576
You haven't met him yet.

01:05:05.576 --> 01:05:10.576
But you will.
And you're gonna be so happy.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:21.577
And I know you don't think so,
but you deserve to be happy.

01:05:25.577 --> 01:05:27.577
You're not thinking clearly, baby.

01:05:29.576 --> 01:05:37.578
Yes, I am. You have to promise me
you're gonna treat him right, okay?

01:05:37.578 --> 01:05:40.578
Okay, okay. Now, drink some water.

01:05:40.578 --> 01:05:42.578
Treat him right.

01:06:01.578 --> 01:06:02.579
Is this what you wanted?

01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:04.579
Yeah. Thank you.

01:06:04.579 --> 01:06:05.579
Diabetic, huh?

01:06:05.579 --> 01:06:06.579
Uh-huh.

01:07:02.582 --> 01:07:02.582
Smell something?

01:07:04.582 --> 01:07:05.582
Fuck, wha...?

01:07:06.582 --> 01:07:06.582
Fuck!

01:07:39.585 --> 01:07:40.583
Shit.

01:07:41.584 --> 01:07:42.584
He's up.

01:07:50.584 --> 01:07:51.584
Sit.

01:07:57.584 --> 01:07:58.585
What'd they get you for?

01:07:59.585 --> 01:08:00.585
Grand theft.

01:08:00.585 --> 01:08:01.585
How about y...?

01:08:12.585 --> 01:08:15.586
This slippery son of a bitch
is going straight to lock-up.

01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:20.585
Oh, come on, pick up.

01:08:22.585 --> 01:08:24.586
Set bail at nine hundred
thousand dollars.

01:08:24.586 --> 01:08:26.587
Your Honor, we'd like to
set a reduction hearing.

01:08:26.587 --> 01:08:29.587
That's your right
but I strongly advise that you don't.

01:08:29.587 --> 01:08:31.587
Well, I appreciate the gra...

01:09:02.587 --> 01:09:04.587
Ma'am? You dropped somethin'.

01:09:11.589 --> 01:09:15.589
Hi. I have Judge Charles Hearn
for the Clerk's Office.

01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:16.590
All right, baby.

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:18.590
This is Charles Hearn.

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:19.587
I got a bail adjustment coming
through...

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:21.589
and I need that processed yesterday,

01:09:21.589 --> 01:09:23.590
so could you slingshot
that shit around the sun?

01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:25.589
You got it, Judge.

01:09:25.589 --> 01:09:26.587
Good. Oh...

01:09:26.587 --> 01:09:30.589
darlin'. You wanna save me a dime
and connect me to a good bail bondsman?

01:09:30.589 --> 01:09:31.589
Fuck you.

01:09:31.589 --> 01:09:38.590
Fuck you! My shoe, my shoe, my shoe.
My shoe. I'm losing this fucking shoe.

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:41.590
Come on, Phillip, pick up, it's me!

01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:45.591
I'm sorry. Come on! Damn it!

01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:48.591
How long you in for?

01:09:48.591 --> 01:09:49.590
Not long.

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:51.590
Can you hit me
in the face with this?

01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:58.591
Hold...

01:09:58.591 --> 01:10:02.591
still. That's a pretty big gash.

01:10:09.592 --> 01:10:11.592
Nice green uniform.

01:11:04.595 --> 01:11:06.595
Sir, I wonder if you
could just get my shoes?

01:11:07.595 --> 01:11:09.595
Could I just have
my shoes, please?

01:11:10.595 --> 01:11:12.595
Come on, man. Seriously.
Come on.

01:11:12.595 --> 01:11:14.595
You're here to
protect and serve, man.

01:11:15.594 --> 01:11:17.596
Can't you just hustle
your sweet little ass

01:11:17.596 --> 01:11:19.595
in there and get my fuckin' shoes?

01:11:20.594 --> 01:11:23.595
Come on, Phillip.
I know you're there.

01:11:30.595 --> 01:11:31.596
We've got turkey.

01:11:42.597 --> 01:11:43.596
Here's your lunch, darlin'.

01:11:46.597 --> 01:11:48.596
Oh. Turkey again?

01:11:51.596 --> 01:11:52.596
Get it?

01:11:52.596 --> 01:11:53.596
Yeah.

01:11:58.597 --> 01:11:59.598
What the hell is this?

01:11:59.598 --> 01:12:00.597
That's all I could get.

01:12:25.598 --> 01:12:27.598
Fucking vice, man.

01:12:30.598 --> 01:12:30.598
But anyway...

01:12:48.599 --> 01:12:49.599
Go away, Steven.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.600
You think I didn't know
you were coming?

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:53.600
Phillip?

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.600
Get the hell outta here.
I'm done with you.

01:12:56.601 --> 01:13:00.600
Honey, I know you're upset.
But we love each other.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.600
You opened a bank account
with Dr. Phillip Morris.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.600
Now they think I'm in
on everything.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:06.601
I'm facing real time.

01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:08.601
You know,
it was for your own good,

01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:08.601
so we could be together.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:09.600
Fuck off.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.601
I'm in enough trouble.

01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:13.602
Come on, Phillip. Trust me?

01:13:13.602 --> 01:13:15.602
Fuck you, you fuckin' liar.

01:13:15.602 --> 01:13:17.602
Do you realize how bad
you fucked me over?

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:20.601
You made me a fuckin' accomplice,
you liar. Fuckin' liar.

01:13:20.601 --> 01:13:21.601
I never wanna see you again.

01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:23.601
Go away.
I never wanna see you again.

01:13:23.601 --> 01:13:24.600
- Phillip, stop it.
- Go away. Go away.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.600
- Phillip, stop it!
- I don't wanna see you again.

01:13:28.601 --> 01:13:30.602
Well what am I supposed to do?

01:13:30.602 --> 01:13:33.602
I got a, a fuckin' limo.

01:13:33.602 --> 01:13:35.602
Well... you're the lawyer.
You figure it out.

01:13:39.602 --> 01:13:41.602
Oh, my God.

01:13:41.602 --> 01:13:43.603
You're not even a lawyer, are you?

01:13:44.603 --> 01:13:47.602
You're not even a fuckin' lawyer,
are you? Fuckin' liar!

01:13:47.602 --> 01:13:48.603
Phillip, open the door.

01:13:48.603 --> 01:13:49.603
- No.
- Open it.

01:13:49.603 --> 01:13:50.602
- No.
- Just open it.

01:13:50.602 --> 01:13:51.602
No.

01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:55.603
Open the door, please?

01:13:56.602 --> 01:14:02.603
I just wanna say one thing, please?
Just one thing. That's all.

01:14:05.604 --> 01:14:06.603
Please?

01:14:23.603 --> 01:14:24.604
Get down on the ground, faggot!

01:14:24.604 --> 01:14:25.604
Come on, do it! Now!

01:14:26.604 --> 01:14:27.604
Get on the ground now!

01:15:01.606 --> 01:15:02.607
- Phillip.
- Don't.

01:15:03.606 --> 01:15:04.607
I love you.

01:15:06.607 --> 01:15:09.607
From the moment we met,
you've done nothing but lie.

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:17.607
Our whole relationship, just lies.
I'm such an asshole.

01:15:19.607 --> 01:15:22.607
You took advantage of me
just like all the others.

01:15:23.607 --> 01:15:26.608
You were supposed to protect me.

01:15:27.608 --> 01:15:30.608
But you just did nothing
butjust make a fool out of me.

01:15:31.608 --> 01:15:37.608
And you expect me to love you?
How can I? How can I love you?

01:15:37.608 --> 01:15:38.608
I don't even know
who you are.

01:15:40.608 --> 01:15:41.608
And you know what's sad?

01:15:42.608 --> 01:15:45.609
I don't even think
you know who you are.

01:15:45.609 --> 01:15:47.608
So how am
I supposed to love somethin'

01:15:47.608 --> 01:15:49.609
that don't even exist, you tell me.

01:15:52.608 --> 01:15:54.609
I will never forgive you, Steven.
Never.

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:09.610
And that was the last time
I ever saw him.

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:11.610
But I knew he was right.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:16.611
Phillip, Jimmy, Debbie,
they've all been right.

01:16:17.609 --> 01:16:20.610
My whole life was nothing
but a bunch of lies.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.611
Lies to make people
give me their money.

01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:25.611
Lies to make people love me.

01:16:26.611 --> 01:16:28.610
And lies to keep them
from leaving me.

01:16:31.611 --> 01:16:35.611
And in the process,
I lost track of who I was.

01:16:38.611 --> 01:16:40.611
Maybe Barbara Bascombe
had me pegged right

01:16:40.611 --> 01:16:43.612
from the beginning and
that's why she gave me up.

01:16:45.612 --> 01:16:46.613
Whatever the case,

01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:50.612
how does a person who
doesn't exist go on existing?

01:16:52.612 --> 01:16:56.612
The answer is, he doesn't.

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.616
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, Steven.

01:18:10.617 --> 01:18:17.615
Your T-cell count indicates that,
well, um, you have AIDS.

01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:31.617
So here we are.
Where you first met me.

01:18:32.617 --> 01:18:35.618
I've been in this bed for
months now waiting to die.

01:18:36.618 --> 01:18:38.618
The only thing that
keeps me going is the thought

01:18:38.618 --> 01:18:42.618
that I might get a chance to
see Phillip one more time.

01:18:43.617 --> 01:18:46.617
But I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

01:18:57.619 --> 01:18:58.618
You got a minute?

01:18:58.618 --> 01:19:00.618
Hey, Sammy.
Do you want a cracker?

01:19:00.618 --> 01:19:02.619
No. Thanks.

01:19:02.619 --> 01:19:09.619
Look, um, I just talked to my friend.
He's a, um... nurse in the infirmary.

01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:14.619
And, um, well, I don't know
if you know this or not. But...

01:19:14.619 --> 01:19:15.618
um...

01:19:16.619 --> 01:19:17.619
Let me in.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:18.619
Just let me in!

01:19:18.619 --> 01:19:19.619
He's not here.

01:19:19.619 --> 01:19:20.619
I need to see him.

01:19:20.619 --> 01:19:21.619
I told you...

01:19:21.619 --> 01:19:22.620
he's not here.
Now, you need to calm down.

01:19:23.619 --> 01:19:26.620
Just tell, tell me where he is.
Or what happened.

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.620
He slipped into a coma
for a few days.

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:33.619
He's conscious now.
But he's very sick.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.621
We had him transferred to
a private care facility.

01:19:37.621 --> 01:19:40.620
There was nothing
we could do for him here.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:44.621
It's just a matter of time.

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.620
I'm sorry.

01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:36.624
Steven.

01:20:38.624 --> 01:20:39.623
Steven.

01:20:40.624 --> 01:20:42.624
Steven.

01:20:42.624 --> 01:20:44.624
Steven.

01:20:44.624 --> 01:20:46.624
Somebody wants to
speak to you.

01:20:47.623 --> 01:20:50.624
He keeps calling.
He's driving us crazy.

01:20:53.624 --> 01:20:54.623
Okay, you can put him through.

01:20:58.624 --> 01:21:01.625
Steve, honey, it's me.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:05.625
I didn't want you to find out.

01:21:05.625 --> 01:21:07.625
Why didn't you write me?

01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:13.626
I don't know how this happened.
They say I'm fine. Uh, anyway, it...

01:21:13.626 --> 01:21:15.625
it doesn't matter.
I had to speak to you.

01:21:16.625 --> 01:21:18.626
I'm still angry with you.

01:21:18.626 --> 01:21:21.624
But there's something that I,
I want you to know.

01:21:23.625 --> 01:21:29.626
Even if sometimes I don't know
who you are, I love you.

01:21:30.626 --> 01:21:32.626
I never stopped loving you.

01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:36.626
I guess you and me are
just fools for love or something,

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:39.627
written in the stars
or some crap like that.

01:21:41.627 --> 01:21:44.627
But it was never better than
with you, Steve, never more real.

01:21:45.626 --> 01:21:47.626
And I realize all that
crazy shit you did...

01:21:48.626 --> 01:21:51.626
in your own fucked up way,
was always for me, always for us.

01:21:52.627 --> 01:21:54.627
You're the most amazing man.

01:21:55.627 --> 01:21:57.627
You take my breath away.

01:21:59.627 --> 01:22:02.628
And even though
I can't be with you right now,

01:22:04.628 --> 01:22:06.628
I'll always be yours.

01:22:08.628 --> 01:22:09.629
Forever.

01:22:14.627 --> 01:22:21.628
Now, if you have to go, go.

01:22:23.628 --> 01:22:29.629
It's okay.
I'm right there. Okay?

01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:36.630
Steve?

01:22:37.630 --> 01:22:41.629
Steve? Steve?

01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:44.629
Steven!

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:47.630
Steven!

01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:49.630
Steven!

01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:53.630
Come on, honey.

01:24:06.634 --> 01:24:09.635
Morris. Come with me.

01:24:21.635 --> 01:24:22.635
Your lawyer's here.

01:24:46.636 --> 01:24:47.636
You fucker!

01:25:03.637 --> 01:25:05.637
Faking your death from AIDS
is no easy task...

01:25:05.637 --> 01:25:06.638
believe me.

01:25:07.637 --> 01:25:12.638
But after watching Jimmy die,
I thought I could make it convincing.

01:25:12.638 --> 01:25:14.637
First, you have to starve yourself.

01:25:14.637 --> 01:25:17.636
I ate half as much every day
for ten months.

01:25:18.637 --> 01:25:21.637
After that, you have to
fake all sorts of symptoms.

01:25:27.638 --> 01:25:28.638
Woof.

01:25:29.638 --> 01:25:34.638
You gotta really stick with it
until you lose a ton of weight.

01:25:36.638 --> 01:25:39.639
The hardest part is
falsifying your records.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.638
But in prison for
the right amount of swag,

01:25:44.638 --> 01:25:46.638
you can get just
about anything amended.

01:25:47.638 --> 01:25:51.638
After that,
bureaucracy takes over for you.

01:25:53.639 --> 01:25:54.639
How long do I have?

01:25:56.639 --> 01:25:57.640
There's no way to tell.

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.640
Yes!

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:08.640
A bureaucracy can only do so much
because the hardest part, by far,

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.640
is getting transferred to
a private care facility.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:13.639
Thank you.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.640
It's standard procedure
for late stage AIDS patients.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.641
But in order to do that,

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.640
I'd have to convince them
that I was about to die.

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:29.641
And that would involve
taking some risks.

01:26:32.642 --> 01:26:35.642
After a four-day coma
they were convinced.

01:26:40.642 --> 01:26:41.642
And once I got settled in...

01:26:43.641 --> 01:26:45.641
I just called
the Department of Corrections

01:26:45.641 --> 01:26:47.642
and convinced them that I was
a state-sponsored doctor looking for

01:26:48.641 --> 01:26:50.641
late stage AIDS patients for
an experimental treatment.

01:26:50.641 --> 01:26:52.642
It's for a study we're doing.

01:26:52.642 --> 01:26:55.642
And I was wondering
if you had anybody

01:26:55.642 --> 01:27:00.643
that would be eligible, uh,
for a transfer into the program?

01:27:00.643 --> 01:27:01.643
Mr. Russell?
Your taxi's here.

01:27:01.643 --> 01:27:05.642
As luck would have it,
they had one patient eligible.

01:27:06.643 --> 01:27:10.643
And for all that time,
all those doctors, all those nurses,

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:16.643
all those facilities, not one of them
ever thought to give me an AIDS test.

01:27:18.643 --> 01:27:19.644
Fucking Texas.

01:27:21.644 --> 01:27:25.644
And after all that hard work dying,
where's the first place I go?

01:27:25.644 --> 01:27:26.644
You fucker.

01:27:31.644 --> 01:27:34.645
I know. I'm sorry.
You weren't supposed to find out.

01:27:35.644 --> 01:27:36.645
Well, I did.

01:27:36.645 --> 01:27:38.645
I couldn't take a chance telling ya.

01:27:39.645 --> 01:27:41.645
You know that I couldn't.

01:27:41.645 --> 01:27:44.645
But Phillip, I only did it
so I could get here to you.

01:27:46.645 --> 01:27:48.645
Butjust so I can talk again.

01:27:50.645 --> 01:27:52.645
And here I am.

01:28:06.646 --> 01:28:09.647
I'm fine. Just hungry.

01:28:09.647 --> 01:28:12.647
Steven, I don't, we...

01:28:12.647 --> 01:28:16.647
Listen. I just came here to tell you
one thing and that's it.

01:28:16.647 --> 01:28:18.647
You don't have to take me back.

01:28:18.647 --> 01:28:19.646
I just wanna say one thing.

01:28:21.646 --> 01:28:24.646
I know you think that
we are nothing but a lie.

01:28:26.647 --> 01:28:27.646
But underneath all those lies,

01:28:28.647 --> 01:28:30.647
there was always something
that was real.

01:28:32.647 --> 01:28:34.647
I thought about
what you said to me.

01:28:34.647 --> 01:28:36.648
You said you
don't know who I am.

01:28:37.648 --> 01:28:38.648
But I know now.

01:28:38.648 --> 01:28:41.649
I know who I am.
I'm not a lawyer.

01:28:42.647 --> 01:28:44.647
I'm not a CFO.
I'm not a cop.

01:28:44.647 --> 01:28:46.648
I'm not some kind of escape artist.

01:28:47.648 --> 01:28:49.647
Those Steven Russells are dead.

01:28:50.648 --> 01:28:53.648
And now all that's left is
the man that loves you.

01:28:56.649 --> 01:28:57.648
And if you can see that...

01:28:59.648 --> 01:29:07.649
and believe it, I promise I'll never
be anything else ever again.

01:29:14.648 --> 01:29:17.649
How do I know you're not
bullshitting me again?

01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:29.650
You don't.
