08:48.945 --> 08:51.572
of the bedazzling,
the ribbon barrette making

08:51.614 --> 08:54.158
and the felt puppet work
that space nurtured.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.744
So for Leslie,
this room will be

08:56.786 --> 08:59.789
pi-ece de resistance.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.541
Okay, you know what, I-I think
we're putting the cart

09:01.582 --> 09:03.918
before the horse here.
Dallas hasn't even said yes.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.920
We're dipping a toe, George.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.713
We're just dipping a toe.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.257
Alright. What do you
want me to do?

09:09.298 --> 09:12.260
Something you'd eventually
have to do anyway.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.970
Order up a dumpster
and dispose of this trash.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.514
A-and by trash, you mean
my memories and family history?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.724
Yes.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.310
Oh, my God. Do you have
a hamster, George?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.604
Clean that up.
That's unsanitary.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.606
'Have you heard
of the hantavirus?'

09:32.697 --> 09:34.824
Did we all get the raspberry
in the finish?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.867
- Yes.
- That was a trick question.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.078
There was no raspberry
in the finish.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.872
Didn't you used to get towels?

09:41.914 --> 09:44.834
With any luck,
by this time next year

09:44.875 --> 09:46.586
we'll be toasting
at your wedding.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.087
Oh, I don't know about all that.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.755
Oh, I think Carmen's right.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.341
George asking you to move in
is one step closer to him ask--

09:52.383 --> 09:55.636
We're really just doing it for
practical reasons, primarily.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.430
What do you mean
practical reasons?

09:57.471 --> 09:59.515
You know, to save money
on the gas we use

09:59.557 --> 10:02.935
driving to each other's
houses...and so forth.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.606
(female #1)
'Are you crying?'

10:06.647 --> 10:08.149
[crying]
No.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.734
[crying]
Yes.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.777
Javier, could you
get me a towel?

10:11.819 --> 10:14.780
What on earth
is wrong with you, Dallas?

10:14.822 --> 10:18.159
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened to you.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.995
- And you met Garry Shandling.
- I know, y'all. I know.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.789
I just thought George asking me
to move in with him

10:23.831 --> 10:26.792
would be more...romantic.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.628
Oh, men don't know
how to be romantic.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.795
Bob does.

10:29.837 --> 10:30.921
The first time we made love

10:30.963 --> 10:32.423
was on a bed of rose petals

10:32.465 --> 10:34.800
that he hot-glued
to my mattress.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.552
'He whispered
in my native tongue'

10:36.594 --> 10:39.221
'that my body was a wonderland.'

10:39.263 --> 10:41.766
And finally,
when I could take no more

10:41.807 --> 10:44.185
he made me arrive.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.396
In fact, I arrived a lot earlier
than I usually do.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.359
I'm gonna hit the showers.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.695
Thanks again for helping me out
with this, man.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.113
(Noah)
'No problem, my Nubian.'

10:56.155 --> 10:59.950
Okay, keep, dump, or storage?

10:59.992 --> 11:02.036
Are you kidding me?
Look at this.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.538
Flap in the back?
Two-tone pockets?

11:04.580 --> 11:05.956
It's a Gordon Gartrell. Keep.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.751
This is a dump
if ever I saw one.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.087
- This is a big, steaming dump.
- Hey.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.338
Keep.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.635
Oh, man.
This is Alex's stuff.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.721
- Dump.
- No, I...I can't do that.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.683
Some of her songwriting
notebooks are in here.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.725
(Noah)
'So?'

11:24.767 --> 11:25.851
No one wants to hear her

11:25.893 --> 11:27.603
poor man's Lisa Loeb-style

11:27.645 --> 11:29.522
vag ballads.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.024
- Dump.
- No. I can't do that.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.110
So...keep?

11:34.151 --> 11:35.444
Well, I don't wanna
keep, either.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.239
But...storage seems weird

11:38.280 --> 11:39.990
and dump just seems mean.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.411
So is there a new category,
is that what you're saying?

11:43.452 --> 11:44.829
That even after
all of these years

11:44.870 --> 11:47.998
your ex-wife
still gets her own category?

11:50.751 --> 11:53.212
While George tried to figure
out how to deal with his past

11:53.254 --> 11:56.257
I was still trying to help
Ryan navigate his future

11:56.298 --> 11:57.758
and time was running out.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.844
Okay, I made a list

11:59.885 --> 12:01.679
of all the pros and cons
of every school.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.765
Tessa, you're blinding me
with science.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.183
I have no idea
what you're saying right now.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.935
The press conference
is tomorrow.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.730
- And nobody's helping me.
- Excuse me. I'm helping you.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.356
I wish I could just
spin a wheel of fortune

12:12.398 --> 12:15.025
and land on the right answer.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.736
Okay. Well, then how about this?

12:16.777 --> 12:18.487
I'll write down the names
of all the schools

12:18.529 --> 12:20.906
put 'em in a hat, and you can

12:20.948 --> 12:22.908
close your eyes and pick one.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.163
The hat will decide.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.707
Well, actually,
the draw will decide.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.503
Fine. The hat.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.297
This was a stupid idea.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.132
This isn't how you
pick a college.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.384
You choose the school
that feels right to you.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.762
The school where you
see yourself.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.681
I knew which school that was,
and so did Ryan.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.975
So instead of
letting him wind up

12:48.017 --> 12:49.518
somewhere he didn't wanna go..

12:49.560 --> 12:51.520
You rigged the draw?

12:51.562 --> 12:54.690
- Mid Florida Tech.
- Wow.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.234
If I threw it all away
and left it up to actual chance

12:57.276 --> 12:59.612
he could have ended up at
the North Las Vegas Institute

12:59.653 --> 13:01.447
for Casino Studies.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.740
- Oh.
- And, uh..

13:02.782 --> 13:04.283
I'm not that much of a gambler.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.285
No. Me, either.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.287
But I do like the slots.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.501
- Do you think I messed up?
- Tessa, no.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.669
I think you put his happiness
before yours

13:15.711 --> 13:17.713
and that's what love is.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.799
[intense music]

13:23.219 --> 13:24.720
[instrumental music]

13:24.762 --> 13:26.138
Uh, thanks, Helen.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.641
Like I said, I just
felt weird throwing it away.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.184
Well, Alex uses my apartment

13:30.226 --> 13:32.019
as her personal
storage unit, anyway.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.814
So what's one more box
on the pile?

13:34.855 --> 13:36.649
Well, um, okay.
Thank-thanks again.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.401
I'll see you.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.111
She always had a grip on you,
didn't she?

13:41.153 --> 13:43.280
What's that?

13:43.322 --> 13:46.075
- Alex.
- Oh.

13:46.116 --> 13:48.702
I don't know..

13:48.744 --> 13:49.954
...what to say.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.330
You don't have to say anything.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.833
I...I know how hard
it must have been

13:53.874 --> 13:55.668
for you to drive that box
over here

13:55.709 --> 13:58.212
to let go.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.755
This woman
you're moving in with

13:59.797 --> 14:02.132
she must be really special.

14:04.802 --> 14:08.639
[sighs]
You know what?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.349
She is.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.690
And this is the attic.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.692
Or as it's called
by the current owners

14:19.733 --> 14:22.361
the crafts garret.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.863
Oh. Hello there.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.906
Oh, 'ello.
I didn't hear you come in.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.158
I were just sewin' my poppet.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.953
Leslie, you just have to see
the view from that window.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.624
[whispering]
Take it easy, kid.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.959
You're supposed to be
a crafts geek

14:37.001 --> 14:38.377
not a Victorian ghost.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.337
The accent felt right
for my character.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.131
Hey. It's my character.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.133
I'm just letting you play her.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.138
So, Leslie, what do you think?

14:49.179 --> 14:52.141
This is it, Sheila.
This is home.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.225
[screaming]

14:53.267 --> 14:55.019
[laughing]

14:56.145 --> 14:58.314
Finally, the moment of truth

14:58.355 --> 15:00.357
she said ironically

15:00.399 --> 15:01.692
had arrived.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.152
Whatever happens, I'll be fine.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.987
I have my career
and I have the two of you

15:05.029 --> 15:07.948
and I have Leslie
and Leslie's baby, Ryanna.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.742
Which, of course,
is not her name. Yet.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.493
(Wolfe)
'Good afternoon.'

15:11.535 --> 15:12.828
Wow.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.496
Let me begin by saying

15:14.538 --> 15:17.583
we haven't seen
this much press at Chatswin High

15:17.625 --> 15:19.668
since our
former drama instructor

15:19.710 --> 15:22.379
staged an underage production
of "The Full Monty."

15:22.421 --> 15:23.756
Oh, it was so good.
Such brave young men--

15:23.797 --> 15:25.007
Don't even. Stop it.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.800
Without further ado

15:26.842 --> 15:28.302
here's the man of the hour

15:28.344 --> 15:30.888
Ryan "The Body" Shay.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.891
[all cheering]

15:36.685 --> 15:38.562
(female #2)
'Ryan! Whoo!'

15:38.604 --> 15:40.522
- 'Yeah, bro!'
- Wow. Hey, everyone.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.067
Thank you all so much
for coming.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.235
I know you're all waiting
to hear my decision.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.364
And it was not an easy decision,
but I decided it.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.118
Rutgers is awesome!

15:53.160 --> 15:55.037
- Thank you, God.
- He's a merciful Lord.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.414
- But I'm not going there.
- Oh, I never trusted you.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.083
He's not real.
I knew he wasn't.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.669
- So then I thought..
- Go, gamblers. Go, gamblers.

16:01.710 --> 16:06.340
...I will not go to this school.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.592
He's not even gonna fake us out?
He's just not going?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.386
So finally, I decided

16:10.427 --> 16:13.055
that I only have three words
left to say.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.599
[dramatic music]

16:15.641 --> 16:18.143
And those three words
are Mid Florida Tech, baby!

16:18.185 --> 16:19.561
[crowd applauding]

16:19.603 --> 16:21.730
Oh, Fred. It's okay.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.191
Thank you, Chatswin. So long.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.654
[instrumental music]

16:31.824 --> 16:34.284
It wasn't goodbye necessarily.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.705
It was just...so long.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.217
Follow your dreams.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.262
- And don't eat carbs.
- Wow!

16:53.303 --> 16:55.514
You have to do both
if you wanna achieve greatness.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.766
Thanks, man.
A-a-and congrats.

16:57.808 --> 16:58.851
Come here.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.897
Yeah. Congrats, Ryan.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.067
We're really gonna miss you,
and whatever.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.652
Thanks, Dalia.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.070
I'm really gonna
miss you guys too.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.530
Yeah.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.824
It must have been so hard

17:13.866 --> 17:16.076
deciding to leave Chatswin

17:16.118 --> 17:17.745
and Tessa.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.955
It was hardest on the hat,
I think.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.207
The hat decided
and I have the hat to thank

17:22.249 --> 17:24.043
because everything

17:24.084 --> 17:26.670
turned out just how
it was supposed to, you know?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.255
Totes.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.632
Unless it didn't.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.634
What is that supposed to mean?

17:32.676 --> 17:35.012
- Why don't you ask Tessa?
- Ask Tessa what?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.847
Ask her why all
the little pieces of paper

17:36.889 --> 17:40.392
that she put in the hat said
the same school's name on them.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.894
Tessa played you, Ryan.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.604
Okay, now I know you're lying

17:43.645 --> 17:45.898
because if Tessa was gonna write
the same college over and over

17:45.939 --> 17:49.234
she would have written Rutgers,
so her and I would be closer.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.737
Unless she didn't
want you to be closer.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.656
Anyway, like I said..

17:54.698 --> 17:56.241
...congrats.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.377
How could you do this to me?

18:10.464 --> 18:13.175
You mean how could I
you?

18:13.217 --> 18:15.260
Look, Ryan, I know
that's where you wanted to go

18:15.302 --> 18:18.263
and the only thing
standing in your way was me.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.265
You're right.

18:20.307 --> 18:23.060
You were the only thing
standing in my way.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.772
Ryan, I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad at me.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.982
I'm mad at you.
I'm super mad at you.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.359
The hat was gonna decide.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.152
But what if the hat

18:32.194 --> 18:33.570
sent you someplace
that you didn't want to go?

18:33.612 --> 18:34.863
It wasn't your call, Tessa.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.782
But you said
I could pick anyway.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.785
Do you remember that?
You asked me to choose.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.204
So, in a way, I did.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.083
- Right?
- Right.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.044
And what you chose
was to send me away

18:49.086 --> 18:50.462
instead of keeping me
close to you

18:50.504 --> 18:52.548
and that's what
hurts me the most.
