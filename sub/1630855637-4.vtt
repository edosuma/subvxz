WEBVTT

00:04.839 --> 00:06.215
[Morgan] Gundleus was
meant to be taking

00:06.297 --> 00:08.217
a stand against his uncle,

00:08.300 --> 00:10.511
-instead he came and slayed us.
-Die!

00:10.594 --> 00:13.222
[Arthur] There will be
no more blood spilt today.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.683
I need my revenge.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.852
[Derfel] You know
I would do anything for you.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.228
Gundleus must die.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.396
[Morgan] Run!

00:20.479 --> 00:23.190
Vengeance is the way of things.

00:23.274 --> 00:24.275
[Morgan] What are you doing?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.609
I'm coming for both of you.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.237
When you close your eyes,
see me.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.448
[Lanval] Gorfydd is
fortifying his border towns.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.242
-Now making weapons.
-Uther dies,

00:33.325 --> 00:34.660
and Gorfydd makes his move.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.620
Cadwys, we'll have to get
their support.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.373
Cadwys has paid
no tax for years.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.417
I just don't want
to betray Arthur.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.545
It's time for something new.

00:45.629 --> 00:48.340
Persuade your uncle to come
to Mordred's naming ceremony.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.384
[Arthur] Ladwys stays.
And if you don't return

00:50.467 --> 00:51.969
with Gorfydd,
I'll kill her.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.554
You didn't even consult us!

00:53.637 --> 00:55.513
Just doing it your way, hmm?

00:55.598 --> 00:57.266
-As you always have.
-[Bedwin] Where are you going?

00:57.349 --> 00:58.684
[Owain] Tax collection
from Cadwys.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.269
He's a cunning bastard,
that one.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.644
You're my man now.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.772
He's broken his bond
with the gods.

01:05.608 --> 01:07.775
[Morgan] Your plan
better work, brother...

01:09.069 --> 01:10.696
or we're all lost.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.541
[tense music playing]

01:29.298 --> 01:30.549
[sighs]

01:48.317 --> 01:49.568
[bird screeches]

01:55.699 --> 01:57.576
[Sagramor]
People are questioning

01:57.660 --> 02:00.746
the wisdom
in releasing Gundleus.

02:03.082 --> 02:04.708
They think I'm a gullible fool.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.043
Apart from the ones
who just think

02:06.126 --> 02:07.378
you're stark raving mad.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.630
[both chuckle]

02:14.969 --> 02:17.846
Three weeks have passed
and Gundleus has not returned.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.766
We're playing
the long game, Sag.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.602
Gorfydd is the real prize.

02:24.395 --> 02:27.856
But Ladwys,
she's my leverage.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.609
We lose her...

02:32.027 --> 02:33.529
we lose Gundleus.

02:34.697 --> 02:35.823
We lose Gorfydd.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.659
We lose.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.499
[footsteps approaching]

02:50.587 --> 02:52.297
[Ladwys] I heard a rumor.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.926
I heard that
I'm very important to you.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.886
The thin thread by which

02:57.970 --> 02:59.722
all your plans hang.

02:59.805 --> 03:00.639
[Arthur] Not you.

03:00.723 --> 03:03.475
The love Gundleus holds for you.

03:03.559 --> 03:06.812
[clicks tongue] That's
a rather fine distinction.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.524
If there's nothing else?

03:10.607 --> 03:13.569
They say you are wise
beyond your years.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.446
More rumors, I'm afraid.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.662
Clearly, why else
would you treat

03:23.746 --> 03:26.582
something of value
so neglectfully?

03:27.833 --> 03:29.460
You're in the women's chamber,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.670
we'll put you in the cellar
if you'd rather.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.673
As much as he loves me,

03:34.757 --> 03:36.425
I love him more.

03:38.052 --> 03:41.722
I can sense his presence.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.892
His absence.

03:46.185 --> 03:50.354
What does that tell you,
wise man?

03:51.522 --> 03:52.900
You tell me.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.487
You set him free because
you want something in return.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.113
Bigger prize.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.575
I won't see him
brought low for love

04:01.658 --> 04:03.619
or betray his better self.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.165
I'll never be a throw piece
in your dirty little trade.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.460
[groans and grunts]

04:11.543 --> 04:12.836
Sag!

04:27.976 --> 04:29.895
[Ladwys choking]

04:31.688 --> 04:33.732
[Morgan] This madness
has to stop, Arthur.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.984
How much longer
are you going to wait?

04:38.237 --> 04:39.905
[Ladwys coughs]

04:40.989 --> 04:43.492
If she was serious,
she'd be dead.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.952
[Ladwys grunts]

04:45.035 --> 04:47.412
I underestimated her.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.582
[coughing]

04:51.834 --> 04:53.919
[Ladwys gasping]

04:57.548 --> 04:59.049
[Raince] It's a good haul,
all told.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.759
[Owain] Aye, not bad.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.427
Double that lot next time.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.638
-[Raince laughs]
-Smashing.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.891
[Raince] Come on, Derfel.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.518
Chop, chop.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.520
Let me show you how it's done.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.896
[coins jingle]

05:12.980 --> 05:14.773
Whoa! Careful!

05:14.857 --> 05:16.775
-You be careful!
-[Owain] Hey, hey, hey, Raince!

05:16.859 --> 05:19.194
-Bup, bup, bup, bup.
-Thank you, my Lord,

05:19.278 --> 05:21.029
but I don't need
my battles fought.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.490
Brutes like him are
as familiar to me

05:23.574 --> 05:24.907
as my own farts,

05:24.992 --> 05:26.618
the downside
of having a brain.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.745
[Owain] All right, well,
tell me this...

05:29.496 --> 05:32.207
how long since Cadwys
paid his tax?

05:32.291 --> 05:37.713
Cadwys, Cadwys, Cadwys,
Cadwys, oh, five years.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.506
Sounds about right.
And what did he manage them?

05:39.590 --> 05:41.925
Twenty hides,
40 fleeces, three slaves,

05:42.009 --> 05:44.678
tin ingots, dried fish,
salt and milled corn.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.763
All right. Raince?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.765
Here's what we'll do.
Send a message on to Cadwys.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.142
Let him know
We'll be arriving tomorrow.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.727
My Lord, we'll be there today.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.645
[Owain] Exactly.
Give them a bit of time

05:53.729 --> 05:55.606
-to move their gold.
-Go on ahead

05:55.689 --> 05:57.149
and tell Cadwys
we'll be there tomorrow.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.484
My Lord.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.612
And we'll be watching?

06:02.321 --> 06:03.655
Yeah.

06:03.739 --> 06:04.990
Oh, you've got a rare head

06:05.073 --> 06:07.284
on your shoulders,
you have, lad.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.827
Don't ever lose that.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.039
We've started
as we mean to go on here.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.624
Let's go take what's ours!

06:14.666 --> 06:16.501
[upbeat music playing]

06:20.047 --> 06:22.841
-What did he say?
-[scoffs] Nothing.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.218
Tell me.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.304
He said that I've got
a rare head on my shoulders.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.765
Hmm. He's right.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.975
And a handsome one, too.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.772
[soft chuckle]

06:58.210 --> 07:01.004
[bird cawing]

07:01.088 --> 07:03.048
[wings flapping]

07:13.392 --> 07:14.810
[sighs]

07:31.410 --> 07:33.203
[Morgan] Why are we here?

07:33.287 --> 07:35.706
I thought our mother
might know what to do.

07:36.707 --> 07:37.833
Is she still here?

07:39.042 --> 07:41.837
I'd be very surprised
if she isn't.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.971
[Arthur] Do you
visit her grave often?

07:52.055 --> 07:53.098
Never.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.018
[squawking]

08:07.321 --> 08:09.614
She used to sit right there...

08:12.367 --> 08:14.076
and as she worked,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.079
flattening a blade,

08:16.162 --> 08:17.748
forging a spear...

08:19.249 --> 08:22.252
she'd tell us stories,
like Excalibur.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.754
Remember that one?

08:24.546 --> 08:27.758
Sacred sword passed down
the generations.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.135
She said it would call out

08:30.218 --> 08:32.346
to its rightful owner
like a beacon.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.640
But those who looked
for Excalibur never found it.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.727
And denied of it,
they would insist loudly

08:38.810 --> 08:40.979
that no such sword
ever existed.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.773
You do remember.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.692
She never told you
that story, Arthur.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.027
I did.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.155
She never told you
any stories.

08:51.782 --> 08:52.908
You didn't know her.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.205
[Arthur] She was
the most beautiful...

08:59.247 --> 09:00.374
clever...

09:01.208 --> 09:04.086
and wonderful mother
a boy could wish for.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.714
She was certainly
beautiful and clever.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.426
You know, you were
frightened of her.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.136
[scoffs]

09:15.389 --> 09:17.808
-Frightened?
-Because she blamed you

09:17.891 --> 09:19.267
for everything.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.730
Most of all,
for Uther rejecting her.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.068
"King's dote on their
bastard daughters," she'd say,

09:28.151 --> 09:31.905
"but they fear
their bastard sons."

09:33.281 --> 09:36.284
And so you strove
to be the best at everything.

09:36.910 --> 09:41.706
Reading and riding
and swordsmanship.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.127
Nothing you did
gave her pleasure.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.922
And even then
you worshipped her...

09:49.881 --> 09:51.925
defended her and...

09:52.592 --> 09:55.720
wept for a week when she died.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.895
[Arthur] Perhaps you're right.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.484
Perhaps she never
told me stories,

10:09.568 --> 10:10.902
never loved me...

10:12.404 --> 10:13.989
but when I needed her...

10:15.615 --> 10:19.953
when I truly needed her,
she was there.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.290
She knew me...

10:26.460 --> 10:28.378
Saw me...

10:28.462 --> 10:31.006
my essence.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.009
And whatever that was...

10:35.594 --> 10:37.012
she valued it...

10:40.015 --> 10:41.933
prized it as special.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.770
Was it love?

10:47.606 --> 10:49.065
I don't know.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.196
But it was enough.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.117
It centered me.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.836
Mother always said
she'd make me a sword.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.171
[Morgan chuckles]

11:16.009 --> 11:17.802
Someone will be glad of it.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.806
[tense music playing]

11:39.032 --> 11:40.158
What is this place?

11:40.242 --> 11:41.826
[Lohilt] An old Roman villa

11:41.910 --> 11:43.328
we let Cadwys
and his folk live in.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.831
Ey up, lad.
Let's move in.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.436
[Owain] Here comes
our messenger.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.277
[Cadwys] Who is this?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.404
What do you want?
Who sent you?

12:17.487 --> 12:19.197
[messenger] I have
a message from Lord Owain.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.241
[Derfel] Which one's Cadwys?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.286
The one doing
all the talking.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.162
Lord Owain will be
here tomorrow,

12:26.246 --> 12:27.956
to collect the taxes.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.254
Right. Let's see
if he takes the bait.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.259
[Cadwys speaking indistinctly]

12:53.481 --> 12:55.400
[whimpering]

12:59.362 --> 13:01.948
[murmuring]

13:05.076 --> 13:07.162
[horse neighing]

13:13.752 --> 13:16.004
[panting]

13:54.501 --> 13:56.127
Ha.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.092
-Nimue.
-Merlin.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.972
[Nimue sighs]

14:22.070 --> 14:23.988
[Nimue] I can hear
the gods again.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.325
They won't answer me.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.994
Your anger is drowning them out.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.330
Give it time.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.208
What are we gonna do?

14:37.168 --> 14:39.045
I'll head
to Caer Cadarn first thing.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.296
Speak to Arthur.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.132
You'll be wasting your breath.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.219
[Merlin] Don't judge him
too harshly.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.263
He's one of the few
who sees what's coming.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.308
Everything good will get bad.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.437
Everything bad will get worse.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.109
Sometimes I think the gods
are playing with us.

15:01.192 --> 15:04.529
Heaping all the throw-pieces
to see how the game will end.

15:04.612 --> 15:09.033
Sparing Gundleus
doesn't speak of strength.

15:10.285 --> 15:15.039
Speaks of weakness... cowardice.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.588
[Merlin] We're going to be
tested like never before.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.299
[Nimue] And cowardice
offends the gods.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.177
[Merlin] Kings, horses
and breastplates

15:27.260 --> 15:29.053
won't stem the tide...

15:30.430 --> 15:32.557
Sacrifices will have to be made.

15:34.768 --> 15:38.438
The day is coming when the gods
must be persuaded to help.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.694
But that will not be easy.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.654
[door closes]

15:46.738 --> 15:48.198
How will you persuade them?

15:50.909 --> 15:53.077
How will we persuade them,
Nimue.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.372
How will we persuade them.

15:58.249 --> 15:59.542
I told you...

16:00.668 --> 16:03.379
you will be
the most powerful druid

16:03.463 --> 16:05.215
the isle has ever known.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.592
That is your fate.

16:08.468 --> 16:12.222
But between now and then,
you will be tested greatly.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.681
Are you ready for that?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.479
-I think so.
-Hmm.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.358
I've endured my own trials,
and I'm still here.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.653
[both chuckle]

16:39.999 --> 16:41.543
[door opens]

16:42.668 --> 16:44.712
-[Owain] Look.
-[object thuds]

16:47.715 --> 16:49.676
[Cadwys] Let's go here.
Come on, come on.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.388
Right. Bring it out.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.559
Come on.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.143
[Owain] Ey up.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.439
[Cadwys] Make sure
they haven't left anything.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.275
[Owain] Derfel.
[whistles]

17:05.358 --> 17:07.235
Follow him.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.320
[Cadwys] Come on, move it!

17:11.030 --> 17:13.199
Bring it all.

17:13.283 --> 17:14.701
Move! Come on!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.498
[tense music playing]

17:51.404 --> 17:54.240
[people chattering indistinctly]

17:54.324 --> 17:57.577
[men laughing]

17:57.660 --> 17:59.203
It can't be.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.462
Merlin?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.718
What are you doing here?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.971
Making sure all's well.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.265
Power hasn't gone to your head.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.225
[Merlin chuckles]

18:22.060 --> 18:24.228
[Arthur laughs]

18:28.524 --> 18:30.401
[Merlin] You still
sleeping under the stars?

18:31.235 --> 18:33.321
-Where else?
-Even when we were guests

18:33.404 --> 18:35.406
at Ban's palace,
we still slept

18:35.490 --> 18:37.867
-under the bloody stars.
-[Arthur laughs]

18:37.951 --> 18:39.994
-Connects us to the Earth.
-[chuckles]

18:40.078 --> 18:42.455
It connects you
to a painful ass.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.009
I heard about Gundleus.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.511
I'm sure you know
what you're doing.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.306
We have to bring
Gorfydd into the fold.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.933
Sparing Gundleus is
a high price.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.309
But one worth paying.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.394
Nimue would disagree.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.813
And that pains me greatly.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.359
But Mordred's naming ceremony

19:11.442 --> 19:13.444
is a chance
that we cannot squander.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.363
That's why I brought you back.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.783
Now you must make them
submit to you.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.039
That's not my nature, Merlin.

19:25.123 --> 19:28.793
No. But it's your destiny.

19:30.837 --> 19:35.591
If Gorfydd comes,
it'll be because he wants to,

19:35.675 --> 19:37.510
not because I made him.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.470
Don't try
and be everyone's friend.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.014
My father tried
to strong-arm Gorfydd.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.849
All he did was drive him away.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.353
I won't repeat his mistake.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.579
[door closes]

20:10.168 --> 20:11.627
Lord Owain.

20:12.587 --> 20:16.382
King Cadwys.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.434
Get up.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.858
[Owain] Good to see you again.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.486
[Cadwys sighs]

20:38.529 --> 20:40.531
I fear you've had
a wasted journey.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.620
Oh, aye?

20:45.703 --> 20:46.913
Aye.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.558
[Cadwys] You see.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.645
All nothing.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.902
Harvest failed.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.613
Oh, the...
the harvest.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.156
-The harvest failed, fellas.
-[Raince laughing]

21:22.240 --> 21:23.866
The harvest failed.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.913
Next year we'll do better.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.420
I can't go back to Caer Cadarn
empty-handed, Cadwys.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.548
You know that.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.515
[coins jingle]

22:00.194 --> 22:02.446
We'll have to make do, won't we?

22:03.197 --> 22:04.615
Come on.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.956
[dramatic music playing]

22:29.015 --> 22:30.600
[Mordred crying]

22:34.645 --> 22:36.981
-Morgan.
-Merlin.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.824
Ralla.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.078
Not quite home, is it?

22:51.162 --> 22:53.664
No, it's not.

22:53.748 --> 22:56.500
But they say
we'll be back in Avalon soon.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.085
-[Mordred continues crying]
-Hmm.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.088
Colic?

23:03.257 --> 23:04.592
Allow me.

23:04.675 --> 23:07.011
-It's not ready.
-Ready enough.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.091
-[crying continues]
-[Merlin gasps]

23:52.265 --> 23:55.059
[people chattering indistinctly]

23:56.936 --> 24:01.232
[Owain] Oh, it's lovely, this.
Lovely little spread.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.192
Remarkable, in fact.

24:03.276 --> 24:07.738
Such fine fare and yet
you can't pay what you owe.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.954
There's money on the moor.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.664
Oh, aye.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.584
Tin.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.045
-Tin?
-Tin.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.925
And gold, maybe.
But plenty of tin.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.844
You can't make bronze
without tin,

24:29.927 --> 24:31.721
and they pay a fancy price
for it in Gaul,

24:31.804 --> 24:33.597
let alone up country.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.726
[burps]
Oh!

24:38.019 --> 24:39.312
It's not my tin.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.315
Oh, well,
it must be someone's tin.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.735
Mmm. Fact is,

24:45.818 --> 24:48.362
Uther let in a pack of men
from Kernow...

24:48.446 --> 24:49.780
[Owain] Kernow?

24:49.864 --> 24:51.240
...to work the old Roman mines

24:51.324 --> 24:53.242
'cause our people
lack the skills.

24:53.326 --> 24:56.287
Oh aye, so head up the moor
and rough up a few miners.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.872
[Cadwys] I can't.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.791
They'd know it was me.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.836
I'd be forced to pay sarhaed.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.966
If... I could find
somebody to...

25:10.051 --> 25:11.927
thin the bastards out for me...

25:12.845 --> 25:15.973
make them look to me
for protection, see.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.693
Yeah. All right. I'll bite.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.781
Tell me more.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.788
[tense music playing]

26:30.381 --> 26:32.174
[coins jingle]

26:32.258 --> 26:33.884
[man yells]

26:34.593 --> 26:36.720
[both grunting]

26:44.270 --> 26:45.896
[man yells]

26:55.448 --> 26:57.366
[grunts]

26:57.450 --> 26:59.201
[Derfel panting]

27:11.464 --> 27:13.090
[coins jingle]

27:15.176 --> 27:16.969
Plenty more
where that came from.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.973
We let you live on our land.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.349
And till our soil.

27:22.433 --> 27:25.769
And yet you pay us back
with scorn.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.105
Scorn.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.279
Well, not any more.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.259
[door opens]

28:36.674 --> 28:38.842
I was the first to hold him.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.262
To look in those eyes.

28:44.265 --> 28:46.267
And you would be the last?

28:46.350 --> 28:47.476
What I saw...

28:47.560 --> 28:50.354
It's a warning, Arthur,
from the gods.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.064
We must heed it.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.610
I will take him north,
a mountain village.

28:56.694 --> 28:59.488
They'll never know he's a prince
and neither will he.

28:59.572 --> 29:00.948
A life of quiet inconsequence...

29:01.031 --> 29:02.324
The only mountain
involved will be

29:02.408 --> 29:04.076
the one
that you throw him off.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.537
While you, year upon year,
guard his throne.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.206
I won't let you kill him
on the strength of a vision.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.052
I'm not seeking your permission.

29:25.556 --> 29:29.351
Some men grow wise in old age,
wise and hard.

29:30.102 --> 29:33.314
Others grow weak
and flabby and frightened.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.150
Your father, for instance.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.404
Uther? Frightened?

29:40.487 --> 29:44.158
And in his fear,
he fled from me to Bedwin,

29:44.241 --> 29:46.410
-from the old gods to the new.
-[Mordred crying]

29:46.493 --> 29:48.370
And the punishment
for his faithless cowardice

29:48.454 --> 29:50.247
-was an evil spawn.
-[crying continues]

29:52.291 --> 29:54.960
Do not choose
the path of compromise, Arthur.

29:57.755 --> 29:59.214
Stand aside.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.011
I am his sworn protector.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.055
Your oath is to Dumnonia

30:06.138 --> 30:07.681
and it's Dumnonia
you'll be serving.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.184
-Mordred is...
-Speak his name...

30:11.727 --> 30:13.437
one more time...

30:17.191 --> 30:21.111
and I shall have to do
some protecting, Merlin.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.451
Stand aside.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.080
No.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.961
Look into his eyes
and tell me I'm wrong.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.303
The gods won't
warn us again, Arthur.

30:47.388 --> 30:52.059
When you find your courage,
you know where I'll be.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.363
[dramatic music playing]

31:06.824 --> 31:08.325
Hold still, Derfel.

31:11.161 --> 31:13.080
[Lunete] You're very brave,
aren't you?

31:13.163 --> 31:15.541
Owain, true to his word, huh?

31:15.624 --> 31:19.128
Double the haul this time!
double the haul!

31:19.211 --> 31:21.171
[cackling]

31:21.255 --> 31:23.465
Oi, Cadwys.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.593
[Cadwys] Yes, Owain?

31:28.762 --> 31:31.724
If we went in
and cleared those tin mines,

31:31.807 --> 31:34.184
dead of night,
no blood spilt...

31:35.185 --> 31:38.689
you're certain
there'll be no repercussions?

31:38.772 --> 31:40.232
I am.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.359
[horse neighs]

31:42.443 --> 31:44.278
-Done.
-[chuckles]

31:46.572 --> 31:48.240
Done.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.535
Now you listen to me.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.371
This stays between us.
Do you understand?

31:55.581 --> 31:57.124
Yes.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.209
[Owain whistles]
Time to go.

31:59.293 --> 32:00.711
[Raince] Cover the haul!

32:00.794 --> 32:02.296
[Raince laughing]

32:13.599 --> 32:15.559
[Bedwin] You seem anxious,
Arthur.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.647
Another day
and Gundleus has not returned.

32:23.901 --> 32:27.154
I have faith, bishop.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.531
Your presence here
every morning,

32:29.615 --> 32:32.201
and last thing at night,
says otherwise.

32:34.703 --> 32:37.581
I hope, in time, you'll trust me
as you do Sagramor.

32:39.374 --> 32:42.419
In exile I survived
by trusting no one.

32:42.503 --> 32:44.588
-[Bedwin] Except your men...
-Except my men.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.261
[Arthur] It's a hard habit
to break.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.555
Well, perhaps
you shouldn't try.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.265
Your father didn't
trust a soul,

32:55.349 --> 32:58.393
but if you hated the Saxon
it was enough.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.437
He'd welcome you
and work with you...

33:01.814 --> 33:03.649
Blackshield, Silurian...

33:05.317 --> 33:07.194
Christian.

33:13.867 --> 33:17.204
[Arthur] Your new
Christian priest,

33:17.287 --> 33:19.748
he is a strange one.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.708
[Bedwin] Ah yes, Sansum.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.754
His mere presence makes me
feel sinful. [scoffs]

33:25.838 --> 33:28.131
Ah, Lady Morgan.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.227
Father trusted him.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.649
Gundleus isn't coming back.

33:45.731 --> 33:49.403
Releasing him was
arrogant and reckless.

33:49.486 --> 33:52.197
And the shine's
coming off you fast.

33:54.324 --> 33:57.286
You need friends, allies,

33:57.369 --> 34:00.247
people who know
how Caer Cadarn works.

34:01.664 --> 34:04.293
Bedwin is
all of those things.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.170
My sister advocating
a Christian?

34:08.046 --> 34:09.548
I have been away a long time.

34:09.631 --> 34:11.800
The Christians have
swelled in number.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.343
I noticed.

34:16.345 --> 34:17.930
Bedwin has their ear.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.682
And...

34:19.766 --> 34:24.396
for the most part he is...
biddable.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.566
Biddable?

34:37.868 --> 34:41.622
Gundleus will come back.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.376
Have a little faith, sister.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.716
[Lunete moaning]

34:56.762 --> 34:58.972
[Lunete] Oh! Oh!

34:59.056 --> 35:01.558
[both panting and moaning]

35:07.564 --> 35:10.317
[both breathing heavily]

35:15.322 --> 35:17.699
You're thinking about her.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.368
Aren't you?

35:22.079 --> 35:23.580
Nimue?

35:26.416 --> 35:27.793
I don't mind.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.465
Really?

35:35.592 --> 35:37.844
You're in my arms, not hers.

35:49.815 --> 35:54.528
It's not so much
that I think about her...

36:00.033 --> 36:01.743
She's just with me.

36:03.453 --> 36:04.579
Not all the time, I hope?

36:04.663 --> 36:07.791
No. No, of course not.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.631
-I mean it.
-I like this life.

36:14.715 --> 36:17.801
Waking up not knowing
what the day holds.

36:19.136 --> 36:20.721
I don't miss home.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.682
Not even Avalon.

36:25.434 --> 36:27.436
And I never thought
I'd say that.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.319
[Merlin] Let's get
some light in here.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.703
[chuckles]

36:55.088 --> 36:56.715
What?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.343
You're with child.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.348
From Gundleus.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.853
We both know it's true.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.773
Then the child
will never be born.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.691
That's for the gods to decide.

37:14.775 --> 37:17.569
No. Never.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.530
I'm so sorry, Nimue.
But if the gods will it,

37:20.614 --> 37:22.449
we cannot stand in their way.

37:22.532 --> 37:23.909
Not when we need them
so acutely.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.869
I cannot bear his child.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.747
Motherhood will rob me
of my powers.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.999
-You told me that.
-No.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.125
This is different.

37:32.209 --> 37:34.419
Why?

37:34.503 --> 37:35.879
Why would the gods
do this to me?

37:35.962 --> 37:39.007
Gundleus is a vagabond king
but a king, nonetheless.

37:39.091 --> 37:43.512
His seed and progeny have value,
and the gods throw nothing away.

37:45.555 --> 37:47.891
A month from now,
you'll feel differently.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.726
A week.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.978
In the meantime,
patience and forbearance

37:52.062 --> 37:53.939
are your friends.
As am I.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.820
[Nimue] I won't.
I won't feel differently.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.613
The gods will tell you
what to do.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.032
-Your role in things.
-When I was small

38:04.116 --> 38:05.826
and I ran away and you found me
in the orchard...

38:05.909 --> 38:08.036
Enough, Nimue!

38:08.120 --> 38:09.788
We have work to do.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.795
[dramatic music playing]

38:27.973 --> 38:29.432
Nimue!

38:44.948 --> 38:46.449
Derfel!

38:50.745 --> 38:52.455
Yes, my Lord?

38:53.623 --> 38:55.709
You're smitten, aren't you?

38:55.792 --> 38:57.586
Better than that witch, eh?

38:57.669 --> 39:00.088
Whatever her name is, er,

39:00.172 --> 39:02.507
-Noomi?
-Yeah.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.718
-I suppose so.
-Suppose so?

39:07.053 --> 39:10.056
Why would you settle
for one of Merlin's freaks?

39:11.183 --> 39:13.101
[hisses]

39:13.185 --> 39:15.562
I'm one of Merlin's freaks, too.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.814
[Owain chuckles]

39:20.150 --> 39:21.818
Well said, lad.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.612
Merlin did a good thing
taking you in,

39:23.695 --> 39:25.697
and you ain't forgotten.
I respect that.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.782
But you can be anything
you want to be now, yeah.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.285
Live any kind of life you choose
and don't let any bastard

39:30.368 --> 39:32.954
tell you different,
you understand?

39:33.038 --> 39:34.497
Listen.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.632
You did well
finding that coin.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.800
I want you
along with us tonight.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.637
Cadwys has a...

39:48.720 --> 39:50.513
dispute
with some local miners.

39:50.597 --> 39:51.848
We're gonna help him resolve it.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.517
Right.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.062
[chuckles]

39:57.145 --> 39:59.981
By taking their tin,
Derfel, not their lives.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.526
Are you with us?

40:05.904 --> 40:08.114
-Yes, my Lord.
-Good.

40:08.198 --> 40:09.991
[Raince] The Guide
from Cadwys is here.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.037
Oh! Good day to you.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.126
King Cadwys has asked me
to show you the mine.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.049
That's all I will do.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.582
[Ultan] Right. Pay attention.

41:00.458 --> 41:04.838
The shelter on the right,
with the cloth roof, see it?

41:05.880 --> 41:08.091
-[Derfel] Yes.
-[Owain] Aye.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.385
[Ultan] That's where
the tin is stored.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.096
The hut on the left,
under the rock,

41:13.179 --> 41:15.348
that's where the watchman
and his family live.

41:15.432 --> 41:18.018
When the miners and workers
finish for the day,

41:18.101 --> 41:21.938
they return to their settlement
on the other side of the valley.

41:22.022 --> 41:24.149
The watchman is
all you have to worry about.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.736
Don't worry, he won't
even know we were there.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.158
I've had my payment
from King Cadwys.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.792
[Owain] Make sure you paint
the whole shield black.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.961
Here, Derfel.
Hold this one for me.

41:53.720 --> 41:54.971
[Derfel] Why the black tar?

41:55.722 --> 41:59.768
Oengus MacAirem,
ever heard of him?

42:01.227 --> 42:02.228
Irish raider.

42:03.355 --> 42:07.984
His men favor black shields
and sharp-prowed boats.

42:08.068 --> 42:10.779
They've long been a nuisance
in these parts.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.822
[Derfel] So they'll think
we are the Irish?

42:13.865 --> 42:15.200
And they will be blamed?

42:15.283 --> 42:18.161
If anyone sees us,
which they won't.

42:19.079 --> 42:23.124
We'll be in and out, Derfel.
No fuss, no bloodshed.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.006
All's quiet at the mine.

42:30.632 --> 42:32.133
[Owain] And the watchman?

42:32.217 --> 42:34.469
His wife just called him in
for supper.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.970
We need to go.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.139
Now.

42:44.979 --> 42:48.024
[all breathing heavily]

43:09.087 --> 43:11.297
[tense music playing]

43:28.356 --> 43:30.316
[Raince shushing]

43:34.237 --> 43:36.197
[cackling]

43:36.281 --> 43:38.241
[dog barks]

43:39.826 --> 43:42.954
[Raince] Come on,
quick, move! Move!

43:43.037 --> 43:44.789
[watchman]
What the hell?

43:45.582 --> 43:47.834
-[grunting]
-[groans]

43:47.917 --> 43:50.003
Stay back!

43:50.086 --> 43:51.129
[grunts]

43:52.464 --> 43:55.133
-[grunting]
-[groaning]

44:04.100 --> 44:06.811
-Derfel!
-[Derfel gasps]

44:08.855 --> 44:10.940
[Derfel screams]

44:13.943 --> 44:15.820
[Derfel groans]

44:26.164 --> 44:27.999
-[loud thud]
-[dog squeals]

44:28.082 --> 44:30.251
[grunts and breathes heavily]

44:32.504 --> 44:35.882
Derfel! Check inside.
No more surprises.

44:35.965 --> 44:37.425
[Derfel panting]

44:37.509 --> 44:39.302
[gasps]

44:48.686 --> 44:52.023
Shh, shh.
Nice and quiet for me.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.317
Okay. Okay. Okay.

44:58.321 --> 44:59.864
Nothing here!

45:01.699 --> 45:03.409
[Derfel yells]

45:06.955 --> 45:09.249
[breathes heavily]

45:12.210 --> 45:13.461
Grab that tin,
leave the shields.

45:13.545 --> 45:14.546
Let's get out of here.

45:14.629 --> 45:16.339
Quick!
[grunts]

45:17.924 --> 45:19.342
[dramatic music playing]

45:26.057 --> 45:29.852
-King Eachern. Queen Eachern.
-[Queen] Bedwin.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.149
King Cadwys.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.110
[speaking indistinctly]

45:49.581 --> 45:52.041
Eachern and Tewdric
have arrived in the last hour.

45:52.125 --> 45:53.543
And we weren't sure about Mark.

45:53.626 --> 45:56.254
[Morgan] Eachern is nothing
and Tewdric's a given.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.298
What of our men on the Western
and Northern Roads?

45:58.381 --> 46:01.968
We have their reports.
No word of Gundleus or Gorfydd.

46:02.051 --> 46:04.429
Without Gorfydd,
Arthur's plan is wrecked.

46:04.512 --> 46:08.141
Perhaps we could delay
Mordred's naming.

46:08.850 --> 46:12.020
-How can we?
-[Bedwin sighs]

46:12.103 --> 46:14.480
It was pure folly to think
that Gorfydd would come.

46:15.732 --> 46:18.026
But Arthur will never be told.

46:19.444 --> 46:21.029
Where is he? Arthur?

46:21.112 --> 46:24.365
If I knew I'd be talking to him.

46:25.366 --> 46:26.409
Not you.

47:03.321 --> 47:05.281
[gentle music playing]

47:39.857 --> 47:41.984
[chuckles]

47:55.415 --> 47:57.500
Lady Morgan, come quickly.

48:01.379 --> 48:05.425
-Gundleus!
-Gorfydd.

48:05.508 --> 48:09.512
[Bedwin] First time he's set
foot on our soil in 15 years.

48:13.850 --> 48:16.018
Open the gates!

48:17.270 --> 48:20.398
[servant] Quick! King Gundleus
and King Gorfydd are coming!

48:22.859 --> 48:25.236
[horses neighing]

48:36.664 --> 48:38.541
[exhales]

49:19.373 --> 49:22.668
Welcome! King Gorfydd,
King Gundleus.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.096
-My Lord...
-Shh.

49:34.806 --> 49:37.141
-Listen.
-[Mordred crying]

49:37.225 --> 49:39.602
The Edling King
has heard our arrival.

49:39.685 --> 49:42.563
But in need of succor
by the sound of it.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.275
[whispering]
Fetch him down

49:46.359 --> 49:48.194
and we'll mop his tears.

49:51.322 --> 49:52.907
The king is trying to sleep,
my lord.

49:52.990 --> 49:58.704
[Gundleus] Yes, fetch Mordred,
and we'll drink to his health.

50:00.206 --> 50:01.457
A drink.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.335
To the Edling King!

50:04.418 --> 50:06.212
-The Edling King!
-The Edling King!

50:06.295 --> 50:08.172
[men] The Edling King!

50:08.256 --> 50:10.383
-[Gorfydd] Stop!
-[Gundleus] Oh.

50:12.927 --> 50:15.263
[whispering]
Fetch him down.

50:15.346 --> 50:17.682
-Or I will.
-My Lord...

50:18.975 --> 50:21.269
you're tired from your journey.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.312
Take your leave a moment.

50:25.565 --> 50:26.691
No.

50:30.027 --> 50:34.490
[whispering]
Fetch. Him. Down.

50:34.574 --> 50:36.409
[Mordred continues crying]

50:42.707 --> 50:44.709
[crying stops]

50:47.336 --> 50:49.797
[Arthur scoffs]

50:49.881 --> 50:51.674
They say I never cried.

50:53.259 --> 50:54.677
Even with colic.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.514
I suppose a bastard's
blessed in a way.

50:59.891 --> 51:02.476
No expectation, no duty.

51:04.353 --> 51:06.689
A bastard's born free.

51:06.772 --> 51:09.609
His days and nights truly
his own and the wise ones...

51:09.692 --> 51:12.528
[sucks teeth]
...never forget it.

51:15.865 --> 51:17.575
Never squander it.

51:20.703 --> 51:23.664
Welcome, King Gorfydd,
I'm glad you came.

51:23.748 --> 51:27.460
I hear you sent Owain
to rob the tribes...

51:28.252 --> 51:30.504
and then take his pick
of the men.

51:34.759 --> 51:37.553
Owain is collecting
overdue tax.

51:37.637 --> 51:39.305
Mmm.

51:39.388 --> 51:43.267
A strong Dumnonia is
a strong isle.

51:43.351 --> 51:44.727
That old line of Uther's.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.272
If Dumnonia falls,
the isle falls,

51:48.356 --> 51:49.315
is nearer the mark.

51:49.398 --> 51:50.775
Only the very slow

51:50.858 --> 51:52.735
or wildly arrogant

51:52.818 --> 51:55.863
would allow their defenses
to become so depleted and...

51:55.947 --> 51:57.448
[inhales sharply]

51:57.531 --> 51:59.533
...you're not slow.

52:02.787 --> 52:04.330
I'm sorry
you won't shake my hand.

52:04.413 --> 52:06.999
Well, you're a bastard.

52:07.083 --> 52:08.751
You must be used to that.

52:11.379 --> 52:12.630
Then why accept my invitation?

52:12.713 --> 52:16.384
-Oh. Curiosity.
-Ah.

52:17.885 --> 52:19.345
Amusement?

52:21.055 --> 52:22.765
Boredom.

52:23.391 --> 52:25.351
And a chance to see my friends

52:25.434 --> 52:29.730
without the stench
of Uther's self-regard.

52:29.814 --> 52:33.943
You will respect
my father's memory in this hall.

52:34.026 --> 52:35.987
This hall?

52:36.070 --> 52:37.780
This hall
where he banished you?

52:37.863 --> 52:39.532
Where he humiliated you?

52:39.615 --> 52:41.492
Where he beat you to a pulp?

52:41.575 --> 52:42.785
Where he beat you until you bled

52:42.868 --> 52:45.287
and you cried
and you pissed yourself?

52:46.831 --> 52:48.874
I wasn't here.

52:48.958 --> 52:50.459
But I heard about it.

52:51.794 --> 52:55.756
An ordeal so wounding
that you never came home.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.427
Not for two months
after his death.

53:04.598 --> 53:06.642
Or was it another memory
you were thinking of?

53:08.644 --> 53:10.479
I didn't know why he did it.

53:15.026 --> 53:16.485
Not then...

53:23.034 --> 53:24.660
not for years.

53:30.791 --> 53:34.378
-[Uther grunts]
-But now...

53:38.007 --> 53:39.717
Now I have an inkling.

53:42.678 --> 53:45.097
He wanted to tell me
that I was nothing.

53:45.181 --> 53:47.558
Not worthy of a sword.

53:47.641 --> 53:49.727
Or the chance to survive.

53:49.810 --> 53:53.606
Never mind the Pendragon blood
in my veins.

53:55.858 --> 53:57.860
No matter.

53:57.943 --> 53:59.487
I am his son still.

54:01.572 --> 54:02.990
Return this man to captivity.

54:03.074 --> 54:07.661
No, no, no, no, no.
I kept my end. Bastard.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.623
More fool me. Huh?

54:10.706 --> 54:12.500
In expecting this whore's son

54:12.583 --> 54:15.086
to keep his word is like
asking a dog to dance!

54:15.169 --> 54:16.545
[all laugh]

54:16.629 --> 54:18.756
I promised you life,
not liberty.

54:19.799 --> 54:21.133
Take him.

54:21.217 --> 54:23.677
[Gundleus yells and grunts]

54:26.764 --> 54:28.974
[Gundleus breathing heavily]

54:39.235 --> 54:40.611
[grunts]

54:46.575 --> 54:47.910
[exhales]

54:56.627 --> 54:59.672
[suspenseful music playing]

55:23.821 --> 55:26.991
Don't shake my hand. Fine.

55:30.828 --> 55:33.581
But you will pledge
to the Edling King.

55:38.669 --> 55:41.964
Or I will take
everything from you.
