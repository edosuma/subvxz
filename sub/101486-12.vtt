00:08.476 --> 00:10.478
D'oh!

00:10.578 --> 00:12.180
(grunts)

00:15.683 --> 00:17.851
(gasps) Where's your helmet?

00:17.985 --> 00:19.787
D'oh!

00:26.527 --> 00:28.262
*

00:37.271 --> 00:42.042
* This woman's gonna get
what she wants today *

00:42.143 --> 00:46.314
* Barney's gonna buy
a new sconce today *

00:46.380 --> 00:50.818
* Gonna buy a broom
to play quidditch today *

01:03.731 --> 01:06.300
* I'm gonna buy
some figurines today *

01:06.400 --> 01:09.670
* Some lovely
pastoral scenes today *

01:09.737 --> 01:12.673
* I've finally found
the rare girl with goat *

01:12.740 --> 01:15.543
* I'll stash them all
in my NPR tote *

01:15.643 --> 01:17.010
* Today *

01:18.078 --> 01:21.482
* The shoppers always haggle,
low price *

01:21.582 --> 01:25.319
* And Flanders always gives in,
too nice *

01:26.554 --> 01:29.022
* Too nice, too nice *

01:29.089 --> 01:31.925
* I'll sell these fuzzy dice *

01:32.025 --> 01:37.331
* Maude bought them
as a joke I did not get *

01:37.431 --> 01:40.534
* Today, today *

01:40.601 --> 01:43.937
* We'll sell our toys,
we pray *

01:44.071 --> 01:49.277
* 'Cause playing is a sin
that we regret *

01:49.377 --> 01:50.411
BOTH:
Yay!

01:50.511 --> 01:52.246
(cartoon scrambling
sound effect)

* A box of Easter candy,
all Peeps *

02:07.895 --> 02:10.298
* Today, today *

02:10.431 --> 02:13.934
* I'll undersell eBay *

02:14.034 --> 02:19.207
* We'll get some useless crap
today! *

02:20.474 --> 02:22.543
See, Marge?
We skip one rehearsal,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.077
and we're totally lost.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.380
* Today! *

02:28.148 --> 02:29.650
Wow, Mr. Flanders.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.985
You're selling
your used birthday candles?

02:32.085 --> 02:33.821
Hmm, they relight themselves.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.257
I won't have voodoo
in the house.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.226
I'm one. I'm two.

02:38.326 --> 02:41.161
I'm three. I'm dizzy.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.963
(groans, thud)

02:43.063 --> 02:44.898
Oh.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.601
Do you really want to sell
these precious memories?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.303
(chuckles)

02:49.403 --> 02:51.239
They're just
earthly possessions, Marge.

02:51.339 --> 02:54.975
All I need is God in my heart,
the good book in my hand, and...

02:55.075 --> 02:56.744
(gasps)
What are you heathens doing

02:56.844 --> 02:58.746
to my Norman Rockwell
commemorative plates?!

02:58.846 --> 03:00.781
(grunting)

03:00.848 --> 03:02.916
We bought 'em, we smash 'em.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.685
Take that, Freedom from Want.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.254
(grunts)

03:06.354 --> 03:07.688
-(boys laugh)
-(Flanders groans)

03:07.788 --> 03:09.523
Look at me! I'm Mr. Rogers.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.626
Yeah. And I'm Meg Ryan
in When Harry Met Sally.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.262
I'll have what he's having.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.864
-We're having a ball!
-Of yarn.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.366
(both laughing)

03:18.499 --> 03:20.000
(groans)

03:22.703 --> 03:24.872
Oh, all this humiliation for...

03:25.005 --> 03:26.840
(scoffs) $21?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.943
Get out
before I turn on the hose!

03:30.878 --> 03:33.046
Thank you.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.883
Okay, fine. I'm not selling
one more precious tchotchke

03:36.016 --> 03:39.052
unless it's going
to a decent, respectful home.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.956
(inhales)

03:44.157 --> 03:46.827
(sighs) Damaged corner.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.996
Excuse me, sir?
I understand how you feel.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.632
Bart Simpson. Longtime neighbor,
first time reader.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.567
May I buy these books?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.469
There's no bad words in these

03:55.569 --> 03:56.904
if that's what
you're looking for.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.539
I cut 'em all out.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.741
Mm.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.543
Thank you...

04:02.643 --> 04:04.345
Adultery Ass.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.014
This is why
I always carry a fan.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.382
Don't worry, sir.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.551
We're boys who have
made our share of mistakes,

04:10.651 --> 04:13.521
but these books will fire up
our imaginations.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.394
*

04:22.696 --> 04:24.865
My greatest moment!

04:28.536 --> 04:30.604
Oh, Bart.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.373
I was filming the wrong way.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.107
It's all me!

04:34.207 --> 04:36.710
This angle makes
my nose look big.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.712
Oh!

04:39.713 --> 04:41.382
(groans)

04:41.449 --> 04:42.550
Hmm.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.687
Bart, that's clearly personal.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.222
You have to give it back
to Mr. Flanders.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.561
You don't have a single little
boy bone in your body, do you?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.063
Hey! I did take karate.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.400
Till I had an allergic reaction
to my gi.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.070
-(bee buzzing)
-There's a bee in here!

05:03.136 --> 05:05.205
(grunting)

05:06.139 --> 05:07.441
(groans)

05:08.576 --> 05:09.910
"My Journal."

05:10.911 --> 05:12.380
Wait a minute.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.417
I've seen that red ink before,
especially the D's and F's.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.387
-(thunder crashing)
-* *

05:22.322 --> 05:24.792
It's Mrs. Krabappel's diary!

05:24.892 --> 05:27.895
(sniffs) Parliament Lights 100.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.963
That was her brand.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.166
EDNA:
Remember: if you can
teach one kid one thing,

05:33.266 --> 05:35.302
hen today will be a success...t

05:35.403 --> 05:38.238
Oh. I forgot
Flanders married Krabappel.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.742
I do not need to see the
dark side of another marriage.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.178
Let the oceans have it, Bart.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.748
They're big enough
to hide any sin.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.017
You would think so, but no.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.686
Why are corpses so buoyant?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.622
'Cause I ain't dead yet!

05:56.123 --> 05:58.258
The boss ain't gonna like this.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.359
I'm the boss!

05:59.493 --> 06:01.462
-Do you like it?
-No!

06:01.529 --> 06:02.863
LOUIE:
Shouldn't we stop those kids?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.598
FAT TONY:
We don't kill children.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.600
We'll wait till they're 18.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.369
This is your fault, Krabappel.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.104
You taught me to read.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.641
If you read this diary,
you'll regret it.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.208
Maybe not today...

06:15.342 --> 06:17.545
-Okay, good enough.
-(groans)

06:21.381 --> 06:23.216
What's it say?! What's it say?!

06:23.316 --> 06:25.986
Does she write about how well
I cleaned the gerbil cage?!

06:26.053 --> 06:28.321
If not, it might be a fake.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.891
It's in there. And a lot more.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.826
She says
Chalmers hides his car keys

06:32.893 --> 06:35.829
on the top of his sun visor.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.466
*

06:40.067 --> 06:41.401
(tires squealing)

06:41.502 --> 06:44.505
I just became
the most powerful kid in school.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.510
Slimmer!

06:49.577 --> 06:51.679
-(tires squealing)
-Uh... What the...?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.247
* *

06:54.347 --> 06:57.585
He's got a free yogurt
at the car wash.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.653
Let's drop the car off
at the car wash,

06:59.753 --> 07:01.555
get the yogurt,
and never come back.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.924
The perfect crime!

07:06.894 --> 07:09.530
There they are! Go get 'em!

07:09.597 --> 07:11.765
Yeah, don't worry.
We'll get your car, but, uh,

07:11.865 --> 07:15.002
all I can think of now is
we should do that, Lou.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.038
Go for a drive just because.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.841
-(grunting happily)
-* *

07:20.941 --> 07:22.109
Ugh!

07:27.781 --> 07:29.950
Finally, thanks to Mrs. K,

07:30.083 --> 07:33.453
I'll know what goes on
in the teachers' lounge.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.223
No, this is not a sales call.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.693
It's an opportunity to improve
your life with gutter guards.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.362
Ma'am, are you sure your family
will be taken care of

07:42.462 --> 07:43.931
in case of a sinkhole?

07:44.031 --> 07:47.300
And with this cruise package,
you're guaranteed a deck chair

07:47.400 --> 07:49.069
for one full hour a day.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.772
So can I...? Hello? Hello?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.373
BART:
So, working
your night school jobs

07:53.473 --> 07:54.975
during school hours, eh?

07:55.108 --> 07:56.544
(laughs)

07:56.644 --> 07:58.646
Oh, you are still there.
You're just very quiet.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.280
I'll wait as long as it takes.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.616
(bell tolling)

08:02.716 --> 08:06.286
Reading someone else's diary
in a church?

08:06.386 --> 08:09.256
That's the worst thing
you can do in a church!

08:09.322 --> 08:11.058
(Irish accent):
No, not really.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.228
Oh, my God. I'm in this.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.830
What did she say?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.966
(angelic choir singing)

08:21.134 --> 08:22.836
"I had a wonderful time

08:22.936 --> 08:25.505
"with my spikey-haired
after-school buddy.

08:25.606 --> 08:29.409
"Sometimes I have to be tough on
him so his behavior gets better,

08:29.509 --> 08:31.344
"but he's smart as a whip.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.080
"When he grows up,

08:33.180 --> 08:36.149
I bet there's no door
he won't be able to open."

08:36.249 --> 08:37.618
What does that mean?

08:37.685 --> 08:39.853
She's saying you have potential.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.321
Oh, my God.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.490
I thought she hated me
after I glued her to her chair.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.525
And yet she says
I have potential.

08:45.659 --> 08:48.662
I have a future.
The sky's the limit!

08:48.762 --> 08:51.098
("Battle Hymn of the Republic"
playing)

08:53.634 --> 08:56.036
("Hail to the Chief" playing)

08:57.504 --> 08:59.472
I got rid of the squeak
in your chair, sir.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.474
Good man.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.311
When do I get paid?
It's been three weeks.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.148
BART:
ow. Presidential chair tester.W

09:08.215 --> 09:09.883
Can't do better than that.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.619
(sighs) This changes everything.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.320
All this time
I was showing my butt,

09:13.386 --> 09:14.722
I was actually showing promise.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.790
I'm gonna live up
to that potential.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.127
* I used to march down
the windy, windy sidewalks *

09:20.227 --> 09:22.062
* Slapping my leg
with a riding crop *

09:22.162 --> 09:24.131
* Thinking it made me
come off so tough *

09:24.231 --> 09:27.635
* I didn't smile because a smile
always seemed rehearsed *

09:27.735 --> 09:29.637
* I wasn't afraid
of the bullies *

09:29.737 --> 09:32.405
* And that just made
the bullies worse. *

09:34.742 --> 09:36.243
Pop art quiz!

09:36.343 --> 09:40.313
Is that a "pop" art quiz,
or a "pop art" quiz?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.050
It's a "shut up
and fill in the bubbles" quiz.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.185
Okay, how am I gonna
blow this off?

09:45.252 --> 09:48.088
Maybe fill in all the bubbles
to make a skull.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.891
Now, hold on, Bart.
You have potential.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.360
Why not really try and do it?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.096
-You think?
-(chuckles) Yes.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.031
(gasps)

09:58.098 --> 09:59.432
I know this one. It's "B."

09:59.566 --> 10:02.035
And after "B,"
the next answer's usually "C."

10:02.102 --> 10:04.371
And the next one
I can get from Martin.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.376
*

10:09.442 --> 10:11.444
This cake is for Bart.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.546
He got an "A" on his test.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.614
Mm-hmm.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.050
What's a matter?
Wondering how I cheated?

10:17.117 --> 10:20.253
You know, all my thoughts
aren't about you.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.890
LISA:
How did he do it?
I must find out.

10:22.956 --> 10:27.294
(gasps) Oh, God.
All my thoughts are about him.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.929
Think pony. Think pony.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.098
-(pony brays)
-(yells)

10:31.198 --> 10:33.433
How'd you do it, Bart?
How'd you do it?

10:33.533 --> 10:35.903
We're just gonna be
very happy about this grade

10:35.969 --> 10:38.271
and not ask questions.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.373
How did he do it?
How did he do it?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.776
Do I have
two high-achieving kids?

10:42.876 --> 10:44.812
Oh, be realistic, Marge.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.114
He must be hiding something.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.249
* *

10:55.055 --> 10:56.790
Ah, he's clean.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.491
And so is his room.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.761
I see you couldn't find out
how he did it.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.931
No offense, Mom,
but mind if I take a whack?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.466
Help yourself.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.668
How, Maggie? How?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.939
Oh, the treehouse, right.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.141
The answer's in the treehouse.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.247
Ay Krabappel!

11:20.347 --> 11:22.783
This is a new low, even for you.

11:22.850 --> 11:23.784
Thanks.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.085
Okay, spill it.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.787
What dirt did you find?

11:26.854 --> 11:30.090
I'm only on page 35, but it's so
clear she thought I was great.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.691
She really liked me.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.693
Even when I brought in
a dead bird from outside,

11:33.827 --> 11:35.262
which I've actually forgotten.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.596
What?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.799
LISA:
Poor, deluded Bart.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.168
She was writing that
about her cat.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.603
She loved how much I love tuna.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.206
I don't remember that either,
but it was meaningful to her.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.607
Listen, Bart...

11:47.707 --> 11:50.443
And she said I was
too adorable to be sterilized.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.179
Oh, her words, not mine.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.646
-Bart...
-She believed in me.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.615
And now I believe in myself.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.185
And I'll tell you something
crazy: I loved getting that "A."

11:58.285 --> 12:00.520
Which means, you know what?
Suddenly, I get you.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.522
You don't suck.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.892
You not only don't suck, you
believe in my potential, too.

12:05.025 --> 12:05.993
Don't you?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.161
(groans)

12:08.228 --> 12:09.897
We're just two smart kids.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.498
I... I... I...

12:11.564 --> 12:13.000
(groans) Okay.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.667
I believe in you, too.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.338
And I have nothing more
to say except... (grunts)

12:18.405 --> 12:20.240
Nothing but... (groans)

12:20.373 --> 12:22.843
Which is worse,
to be cruel or to lie?

12:22.910 --> 12:24.744
They're both great,
just like us.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.413
Two smart kids.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.015
And you know
what I'm gonna do now?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.884
I'm gonna change someone else's
life for the better.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.252
(cash register dings)

12:32.352 --> 12:34.021
BART:
Willie?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.422
I heard-- can't say where--

12:35.522 --> 12:37.157
that you're
actually pretty lonely.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.092
So I got you this little guy.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.028
A Scotsman lonely?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.429
Bannocks to that!

12:42.562 --> 12:45.532
But I will take
your wee coney...

12:45.598 --> 12:47.600
for me evening stew!

12:51.171 --> 12:52.873
Do you like your stew?

12:52.940 --> 12:56.509
It's got lots of extra carrots
for a growing bunny.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.778
And when you grow fat enough,

12:58.912 --> 13:01.681
I'll stick you
in a bubbling pot of water...

13:01.781 --> 13:04.117
for your Saturday bath.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.552
Oh, I love you.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.889
(groans) This lie
has made Bart a new man.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.591
And it's giving me
anxiety attacks.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.360
(hyperventilating)

13:13.460 --> 13:15.395
Relax. Relax.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.065
Ugh, so anxious. (screams)

13:18.131 --> 13:20.700
-What's this?
-You've got bumpies!

13:20.800 --> 13:23.470
Let me give you some lotion.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.773
I'll be fine.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.476
I just need a calming bath
and a good night's sleep.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.312
(gentle music playing)

13:35.983 --> 13:39.586
(chanting):
Om... om...

13:39.652 --> 13:41.588
Oh, my God!

13:41.654 --> 13:44.324
I'm helping him live a lie
that may ruin him!

13:45.592 --> 13:49.662
Hmm. Sometimes tension hives
are the result of inner stress.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.999
Is anything bothering you,
young lady?

13:52.099 --> 13:54.101
Just the usual--
global disasters,

13:54.167 --> 13:56.569
artificial intelligence
taking over,

13:56.669 --> 13:59.239
the cold, dead eyes
of Mike Pence.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.442
Hmm. Well, I could refer you
to psychological counseling,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.177
but why fix what you can numb?

14:04.311 --> 14:07.180
So I'm gonna prescribe
some Sleepy and Dopey's

14:07.314 --> 14:09.249
children's chewable Xanax.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.951
(laughs)

14:11.018 --> 14:13.420
I don't want
my daughter on meds.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.088
You seem upset, Marge.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.924
Talk to your doctor
about Troxodone.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.425
You are my doctor.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.693
Well, well, well. Fancy that.

14:20.827 --> 14:21.861
(laughs)

14:21.995 --> 14:23.263
This is gonna turn your life

14:23.363 --> 14:25.798
into an oasis
of peaceful zombitude.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.700
Side effects may include
bleeding out your ears,

14:27.834 --> 14:29.269
Portuguese insolence,
wandering eyebrow,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.138
intense longing for death,
and seeing yourself

14:31.204 --> 14:33.306
as others see you. (laughs)

14:35.308 --> 14:37.377
When the last student
finishes using the lice comb,

14:37.477 --> 14:38.979
please pass it back up.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.651
Now our major award of the day.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.019
For me?

14:46.119 --> 14:50.023
But my shelves are
already groaning with kudos.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.624
-Not for you.
-Aw.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.526
For the only student
who's shown dramatic improvement

14:53.626 --> 14:55.662
in the history
of this school: Bart Simpson!

14:55.728 --> 14:57.730
-Let's hear it for him.
-(student coughs)

14:57.864 --> 15:00.533
I'll take names
if I don't hear cheers.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.803
STUDENTS (chanting):
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

15:03.903 --> 15:07.007
I just want to say
thank you, Mrs. K.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.242
You wrote the book on teaching.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.579
And now, his sister,
Lisa Simpson,

15:12.712 --> 15:15.815
will lead us in a round of
"For He's A Jolly Good Fellow."

15:15.915 --> 15:17.417
What?

15:18.551 --> 15:20.653
* For he's a jolly good fellow *

15:20.753 --> 15:24.491
* For he's a jolly
good fellow... *

15:25.525 --> 15:27.027
To the laser tag water park!

15:27.094 --> 15:28.495
(students cheering)

15:32.532 --> 15:34.434
Take the freeway! It's quicker!

15:36.603 --> 15:38.771
* All of it's based on a lie *

15:38.905 --> 15:40.773
* All of it's based
on a lie *

15:40.907 --> 15:43.110
* For he's a jolly big phony *

15:43.243 --> 15:45.612
* And only I know why. *

15:45.712 --> 15:48.115
(clears throat)
Assembly item number two:

15:48.248 --> 15:50.683
-don't take drugs.
-I don't!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.785
Our most successful
assembly ever.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.026
Thanks to Mrs. K, I fear
nothing. Not even long division.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.027
Hmm.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.361
What if there's a remainder?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.630
Still a little scary.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.099
You wanted to do well,
but you're not even studying.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.135
You don't have to study
when you're on a roll.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.869
You heard them cheering me.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.205
STUDENTS (chanting):
Bart! Bart! Bart! Not Lisa!

16:12.305 --> 16:14.141
I wish you hadn't
had them do that.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.708
You know what I'm gonna do now?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.977
I'm gonna enter
the spelling bee.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.748
Um, really? Just like that?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.650
How about
a little reality check?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.552
Spell "pneumatic."

16:25.652 --> 16:26.986
No problem.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.090
You're gonna start it
with an "N," aren't you?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.059
I'll know
when the spotlight hits me.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.760
Two smart kids.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.829
Bart, spelling bees
are very public.

16:36.963 --> 16:40.333
So if, by some fluke,
you don't do well,

16:40.467 --> 16:43.436
you'll be embarrassed
in front of the whole school.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.340
Worse than the time you sat
on the peanut butter cup.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.941
People knew what it was.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.677
No, they didn't.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.014
LISA:
Let him learn his lesson.
Let him gain from it.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.749
t's not up to you to save him.I

16:56.849 --> 16:58.151
(gasps)

16:58.251 --> 17:00.353
The first contestant is
our most-improved student,

17:00.487 --> 17:03.756
Bart Simpson,
and the word is "interlude."

17:03.856 --> 17:06.526
Um, can you use it
in a sentence?

17:06.659 --> 17:08.661
I need an interlude
with my brother!

17:08.761 --> 17:11.198
I have to explain something.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.100
Obsolescence-- O-B...

17:13.200 --> 17:15.302
You don't have to explain.
It's totally understandable.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.105
You're just jealous. I used
to be a mixed-up kid like you.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.507
You're just not reading
the right diaries.

17:20.607 --> 17:21.974
MILHOUSE:
Obsequious...

17:22.041 --> 17:24.877
Bart, there's a page in
the diary you didn't read yet.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.046
(inhales) I'm sorry.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.448
I'm so sorry.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.350
I just don't want you hurt.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.721
"My special little guy has
the fluffiest tail"?

17:34.821 --> 17:37.056
Still think
she's talking about you?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.126
Could be. I played a reindeer
in the school play.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.394
Which was weird, because
it wasn't a Christmas play.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.529
Keep reading.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.397
"Purring when I pet him"?

17:44.497 --> 17:45.898
"Scratching at
the bell on his collar"?

17:45.998 --> 17:48.635
"Always using his litter box
appropriately"?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.070
Oh, it wasn't me
who had potential.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.573
It's a frickin' cat!

17:55.074 --> 17:57.744
(whimpering)

17:58.745 --> 17:59.812
(gasps)

17:59.912 --> 18:02.415
(whimpering)

18:02.549 --> 18:04.584
Oh. No bumps.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.887
-I brought you dinner.
-Don't want it.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.557
I'm just a loser kid,
and that's all I will ever be.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.091
Oh, honey...

18:12.192 --> 18:13.560
Mom, I'm gonna go over the edge

18:13.660 --> 18:15.428
if you try to make me
feel better right now.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.264
Hmm...

18:21.401 --> 18:23.336
So, I understand

18:23.436 --> 18:25.938
you've been reading
Edna's diary.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.707
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.277
I sure hope there's something
in the Bible about forgiveness.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.179
Son, I'm not here to judge you.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.214
Curiosity is one of
the devil's sharpest tools.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.449
That's why I don't even
look down in the shower.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.118
Eyes always up
into God's scalding water.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.787
(chuckles)

18:40.887 --> 18:42.889
Okay, I'll get to the point.
I'm here to tell you

18:42.955 --> 18:44.691
something that might
make you feel better.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.293
Did you know Edna and I once

18:46.393 --> 18:48.295
were thinking
of leaving Springfield?

18:48.395 --> 18:49.962
Oh, I feel so much better.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.565
How does he do it? I don't know!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.367
But the fact is we didn't move.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.802
We had a family meeting.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.637
It was Todd's turn at the gavel.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.739
TODD:
Order! Order!

18:59.806 --> 19:02.975
Now, we can't leave Springfield
unless it's unanimous. Todd?

19:03.075 --> 19:04.877
TODD:
I vote "yes."
I can finally get away

19:04.977 --> 19:06.813
from that ladybug
that scares me.

19:06.946 --> 19:10.783
I'm tired of Mr. Simpson
peeing in our bird bath.

19:10.883 --> 19:14.221
Well, that's one, two,
three, and...

19:14.321 --> 19:16.055
I have to stay here
in Springfield,

19:16.155 --> 19:18.124
because boys
like Bart Simpson need me.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.493
Sweet, misunderstood boys,

19:20.627 --> 19:23.296
who just need someone
to recognize the basic goodness

19:23.396 --> 19:25.064
that's trapped inside them

19:25.164 --> 19:27.934
and is desperately
trying to get out.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.236
(sneezes)

19:29.336 --> 19:31.238
She was allergic
to the cat, but, uh,

19:31.338 --> 19:33.240
you were nothing
to sneeze at, son.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.608
Well, did that help?

19:35.675 --> 19:36.943
Yeah!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.678
Now let us give thanks.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.013
If only people stopped
when they made their point.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.415
But thanks.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.451
And this belongs to you.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.852
You might want to read it.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.587
You come off pretty well.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.189
No sirree, Bob. Those are
Edna's private thoughts,

19:50.323 --> 19:52.525
and they're gonna stay private.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.861
Did you fix Bart?

19:54.994 --> 19:56.028
Yep.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.464
What's in your hand?

19:57.530 --> 19:59.832
Uh, uh, nothing.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.269
* *

20:02.369 --> 20:04.337
"Now that I've been
with Ned a year,

20:04.437 --> 20:06.439
he's made my life a living..."

20:06.539 --> 20:09.376
I'll think of a penance.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.812
"Dream come true."

20:12.879 --> 20:15.515
Oh. (sniffles)
Now I got to clean my specs.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.049
Thanks, Edna.

20:21.854 --> 20:25.858
* I found her diary
underneath a tree *

20:25.958 --> 20:30.397
* And started reading about me *

20:31.631 --> 20:36.503
* The words she'd written
took me by surprise *

20:36.569 --> 20:40.540
* You'd never read them
in her eyes *

20:40.640 --> 20:46.513
* All the sweet things
they can find. *

20:49.349 --> 20:51.384
*
