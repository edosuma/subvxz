02:59.342 --> 03:00.742
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:09.854 --> 03:11.422
I got you.

03:11.424 --> 03:12.890
<i>So this woman,</i>
<i>you know, she's flirting,</i>

03:12.892 --> 03:14.625
asking all these questions.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.228
You know, she came
to buy a tree,

03:16.230 --> 03:18.296
but suddenly she's less
and less interested.

03:18.298 --> 03:21.634
So, she convinces him
to sneak away for a minute.

03:21.636 --> 03:24.370
<i>So they go behind the stand.</i>

03:24.372 --> 03:26.606
<i>There's like this little alley</i>
<i>behind the building.</i>

03:26.608 --> 03:28.976
Boom, she goes down on him.

03:28.978 --> 03:31.845
He's sitting there,
this freezing ass cold night

03:31.847 --> 03:31.845
suddenly ain't so bad, right?

03:31.847 --> 03:37.285
Gettin' head from this beautiful
girl, starring up at the stars.

03:37.620 --> 03:41.991
<i>So, he finishes and all of a</i>
<i>sudden she gets all embarrassed</i>

03:41.993 --> 03:43.592
and then she runs away.

03:43.594 --> 03:45.262
And he doesn't
really think about it,

03:45.264 --> 03:47.998
he just walks back to the stand,
gleaming, you know?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.803
He gets back,
all the trees are gone.

03:54.006 --> 03:55.606
<i>Shut up.</i>

03:55.874 --> 03:58.910
<i>Every single one of 'em, empty.</i>

03:58.912 --> 04:01.280
Wow, even the who-hash.

04:13.395 --> 04:15.797
<i>Oh, hi.</i>
<i>How much are those wreaths?</i>

04:15.799 --> 04:18.767
<i>The small ones are $10,</i>
<i>the big ones are $20.</i>

04:19.035 --> 04:21.303
How big are the smalls?

04:23.040 --> 04:24.707
That's a small.

04:25.409 --> 04:26.409
Yeah, that's good.

04:26.411 --> 04:29.479
- That works?
- Yeah.

04:30.815 --> 04:33.518
- All right, anything else?
- No, thanks.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.132
All right.

04:37.923 --> 04:40.326
I'm gonna finish up
the lights out here.

04:53.975 --> 04:55.943
<i>It smells so good.</i>

05:00.083 --> 05:02.017
Hey guys, lights are done.

06:18.474 --> 06:20.475
Yo, it's not a bad
night's sleep in there.

06:20.477 --> 06:21.877
If you say so.

06:22.012 --> 06:24.947
Two sixteen-inch wreaths
and a daddy burger swag.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.671
I like this.

06:44.673 --> 06:48.708
Look at this, this is round.
It feels good.

06:48.710 --> 06:51.245
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

06:51.247 --> 06:54.048
- How much for this one?
- Sixty.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.650
- And that one?
- Also $60.

06:56.653 --> 06:59.654
Yeah, these are all
the same trees, same height.

07:00.656 --> 07:02.692
So, what do you think.

07:02.694 --> 07:04.126
Oh, it's kinda big.

07:04.128 --> 07:06.529
I don't think we have
that much room.

07:06.531 --> 07:09.199
What are you talking about?
We got 8-foot ceilings.

07:09.201 --> 07:11.802
- We do?
- We bought from you last year.

07:11.804 --> 07:13.704
<i>Oh, great.</i>

07:13.706 --> 07:16.975
<i>Is that nice girl</i>
<i>still working here?</i>

07:16.977 --> 07:18.877
Not this year.

07:19.945 --> 07:22.948
- You sell the bases?
- Yep, stands.

07:22.950 --> 07:25.551
- Yeah, how much are they?
- $20.

07:28.289 --> 07:29.890
Let's go for it.

07:29.892 --> 07:31.691
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:33.962 --> 07:36.531
<i>Do we have those lights</i>
<i>from last year?</i>

07:36.832 --> 07:38.566
<i>Oh yeah, they're</i>
<i>in a box in the closet,</i>

07:38.568 --> 07:38.566
<i>but I don't think they work.</i>

07:38.568 --> 07:41.303
<i>But they worked last year.</i>

07:41.305 --> 07:42.971
No, I'm telling you
they don't work

07:42.973 --> 07:44.908
because I remember
you were putting them away

07:44.910 --> 07:44.908
and you said they were broken.

07:44.910 --> 07:48.278
<i>Why would I save broken lights?</i>

07:48.280 --> 07:50.881
- Do you have lights?
- Yep, white or colored?

07:50.883 --> 07:52.716
<i>We don't need lights.</i>

07:53.585 --> 07:55.920
All right, all right.

08:00.192 --> 08:02.193
- Here, keep that.
- Oh, great, thanks.

08:02.195 --> 08:02.193
<i>Thanks.</i>

08:02.195 --> 08:06.599
<i>Just put some hot water</i>
<i>on it tonight.</i>

08:06.601 --> 08:09.002
It breaks open the sap
and absorbs better,

08:09.004 --> 08:11.138
and then just
lukewarm after that.

08:11.140 --> 08:13.140
- Lukewarm?
- Yeah, middle of the faucet.

08:13.142 --> 08:15.009
Okay.

08:15.011 --> 08:16.878
All right. Well, thanks.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.713
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>We'll see you again.</i>

08:19.215 --> 08:22.585
<i>Just watch out.</i>
<i>I don't know where you are.</i>

08:22.919 --> 08:24.653
- Thank you.
- All right, thanks.

08:45.245 --> 08:46.946
<i>No number ones?</i>

08:47.247 --> 08:48.881
Do you not know the difference?

08:48.883 --> 08:50.383
<i>No, I know the difference.</i>

08:50.385 --> 08:53.120
Oh yeah, well, I just don't
like to sell crappy trees.

08:53.122 --> 08:54.955
All right,
it's your money, man.

08:54.957 --> 08:56.357
My brother
went along with that?

08:56.359 --> 08:58.827
<i>Yeah, he didn't care.</i>
<i>He barely sold anything.</i>

08:58.829 --> 09:00.161
<i>He just worked the night shift.</i>

09:00.163 --> 09:01.830
<i>That makes sense.</i>

09:01.832 --> 09:03.299
<i>He says hi by the way.</i>

09:05.235 --> 09:08.337
- He still in Massena?
- Yeah, working for our dad.

09:12.410 --> 09:14.311
This is where it usually goes?

09:14.713 --> 09:16.681
<i>Yep, that works.</i>

09:18.317 --> 09:20.385
That sign is new.

09:23.156 --> 09:25.391
Finally repaved the road.

09:25.393 --> 09:27.927
I never thought I'd see that.

09:29.130 --> 09:31.097
<i>What else is different?</i>

10:05.072 --> 10:08.875
<i>I go back and the tank's</i>
<i>still just sitting there.</i>

10:10.378 --> 10:11.945
<i>I just don't understand</i>

10:11.947 --> 10:14.749
how the people
doesn't care about the jobs.

10:15.350 --> 10:17.919
They gotta know
how shitty they are.

10:19.188 --> 10:21.857
Yeah, I guess some people
just don't care.

10:22.192 --> 10:26.930
How can you not care,
at least a bit?

10:27.231 --> 10:29.199
<i>You know, not everybody's</i>
<i>like you and me, Martin.</i>

10:29.201 --> 10:32.970
<i>Yeah, that's for sure.</i>

10:32.972 --> 10:36.407
<i>But you must put up</i>
<i>with a lot of shit around here.</i>

10:38.478 --> 10:40.145
Five years running.

10:40.947 --> 10:42.347
Five years?

10:42.482 --> 10:44.149
Holy shit.

10:44.885 --> 10:47.453
I never done
nothing for 5 years.

10:47.988 --> 10:52.092
<i>I was with a woman</i>
<i>for 3 years once.</i>

10:55.964 --> 10:57.365
<i>Where's Mary-Ann?</i>

10:58.000 --> 10:59.768
<i>I didn't see her around.</i>

10:59.969 --> 11:02.170
Yep, she's not
around this year.

11:02.773 --> 11:05.508
<i>I am sorry to hear that.</i>

11:06.543 --> 11:09.112
That must make
your holiday even tougher.

11:10.515 --> 11:12.516
Yeah, it's just 1 month a year.

11:14.018 --> 11:15.787
<i>Christmas.</i>

11:17.322 --> 11:19.223
Christmas sucks.

11:41.050 --> 11:44.887
Seven, eight, no frasers?

11:45.823 --> 11:47.957
Lots of smalls.

11:47.959 --> 11:49.425
You got small frasers.

11:49.427 --> 11:51.028
<i>Not under 4'.</i>

11:52.163 --> 11:53.897
The new Dougs coming in?

11:53.899 --> 11:55.232
<i>Maybe tomorrow.</i>

11:55.234 --> 11:57.502
Truck's stuck in the snow.

11:57.504 --> 12:00.939
<i>The twins sold some tall ones.</i>

12:00.941 --> 12:06.178
- How tall?
- A couple 12s, a couple 10s.

12:06.180 --> 12:09.249
You know, those brownstones
over there, high ceilings.

12:09.251 --> 12:11.518
- How's your generator doing?
- Good.

12:11.520 --> 12:11.518
Why, what happened
to the old one?

12:11.520 --> 12:16.257
<i>Oh, it's noisy.</i>
<i>Some neighbor complained.</i>

12:16.259 --> 12:18.593
Hey, keep what's-his-name's
mitts off that thing, will ya?

12:18.595 --> 12:20.127
Nick, yeah, he'll be all right.

12:20.129 --> 12:21.864
- What's that girlfriend's name?
- Robin.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.399
<i>Robin, she's</i>
<i>a sweet little thing.</i>

12:26.269 --> 12:28.872
<i>There's oil under the sink.</i>
<i>Every 2 days.</i>

13:17.696 --> 13:20.298
<i>Hey man, Nick, you gotta do</i>
<i>a better job with these needles.</i>

13:20.300 --> 13:22.234
<i>The last few nights the place</i>
<i>has been covered.</i>

13:22.236 --> 13:24.169
But there's barely
any needles anywhere.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.570
Okay, well there
shouldn't be any.

13:25.572 --> 13:25.570
If people see the needles

13:25.572 --> 13:28.641
they'll think
the trees are dead.

13:28.643 --> 13:30.376
<i>The trees are dead,</i>
<i>everyone knows that.</i>

13:30.378 --> 13:32.178
But they don't wanna be
reminded of it, okay?

13:32.180 --> 13:35.449
So when there's needles, which
there will be, you clean 'em up.

13:35.451 --> 13:37.117
That's why I do on my shift,

13:37.119 --> 13:37.117
that's what you do
on your shift.

13:37.119 --> 13:40.055
- Okay, that's how it works.
- Yeah, I know how it works.

13:40.057 --> 13:41.990
All right, all right.

13:47.197 --> 13:48.531
Hey.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.667
You know, you don't have to be
so hard on him.

13:52.003 --> 13:55.138
- He's done this before.
- Not here.

13:55.140 --> 13:58.076
<i>Yeah, well I'm sure</i>
<i>even you were new once.</i>

13:58.078 --> 14:00.545
He's got a problem,
he can say so.

14:01.413 --> 14:04.016
<i>We'll be moving</i>
<i>into my sister's place tomorrow.</i>

14:04.417 --> 14:06.318
<i>No more trailer.</i>

16:30.555 --> 16:32.923
<i>Really we could trim him</i>
<i>and make him skinny, right?</i>

16:32.925 --> 16:34.525
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:10.733 --> 17:12.435
<i>I think we got everything,</i>

17:12.436 --> 17:14.771
but if not
we'll just grab it tomorrow.

17:14.973 --> 17:17.340
- All right.
- See you in the morning.

17:17.343 --> 17:19.310
<i>See you guys.</i>

18:25.288 --> 18:28.357
Sir, is that yours?

18:32.530 --> 18:35.332
Hello? Ma'am?

18:36.668 --> 18:38.603
Hello?

18:39.571 --> 18:41.506
<i>Do you know her?</i>

18:45.412 --> 18:46.912
<i>Ma'am?</i>

18:47.747 --> 18:49.515
<i>Ma'am?</i>

18:50.451 --> 18:52.652
<i>Is this your phone, sir?</i>

18:53.087 --> 18:54.921
Ma'am?

18:59.895 --> 19:01.796
<i>Is this your phone?</i>

19:01.963 --> 19:04.032
<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

19:05.968 --> 19:07.769
Fuck.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.380
All right, a couple more steps.

19:22.888 --> 19:24.989
Step up. Big step up.

21:22.862 --> 21:25.196
Yep. Five years.

21:25.198 --> 21:28.000
<i>You still with Mary-Ann?</i>
<i>She not here this year?</i>

21:28.002 --> 21:30.870
No, she's... yeah,
just me this year.

22:06.913 --> 22:09.549
<i>I don't know, the real kind?</i>

22:09.551 --> 22:11.617
<i>They all look the same to me.</i>

22:12.119 --> 22:13.921
Under the shelf, no way.

22:13.923 --> 22:16.056
It's not gonna fit.

22:16.058 --> 22:18.859
It's not a height issue,
it's the width.

22:18.861 --> 22:21.062
I know because
I'm staring at it.

22:21.064 --> 22:23.231
I don't know,
they're all the same.

22:23.233 --> 22:25.233
All right, fine, I'll ask.

22:25.235 --> 22:28.103
<i>Are they all this wide?</i>

22:28.105 --> 22:29.672
<i>Do you have any skinnier trees?</i>

22:29.674 --> 22:29.672
Huh?

22:29.674 --> 22:33.877
<i>Do you have any skinnier trees?</i>

22:34.745 --> 22:37.213
This is a little skinnier.

22:37.215 --> 22:39.617
That's not so bad actually.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.254
Yeah, all right, fine.

22:43.256 --> 22:45.324
All right,
hold it straight please.

22:47.226 --> 22:49.896
<i>All right, yeah, I'll send it.</i>

22:49.898 --> 22:51.764
<i>Just gonna be a minute.</i>

22:51.766 --> 22:53.833
<i>Yeah, you get it yet?</i>

22:53.835 --> 22:56.670
<i>Sure, I love your tortellini.</i>

22:56.838 --> 22:58.772
<i>What about that tuna thing?</i>

22:58.774 --> 23:00.240
<i>All right.</i>

23:00.242 --> 23:03.178
<i>I don't know, 4 feet.</i>
<i>How tall is that?</i>

23:03.180 --> 23:03.178
Yeah, 4 feet.

23:03.180 --> 23:03.178
<i>It's gonna come up</i>
<i>to your chest.</i>

23:03.180 --> 23:09.118
<i>All right, fine.</i>
<i>I'll stand next to the next one.</i>

23:09.120 --> 23:11.053
<i>What do you call it?</i>

23:11.055 --> 23:13.389
- It's a balsam fir.
- Balsam fir.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.892
It's like the wood,
it's super light.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.862
- How light is this?
- It's pretty light.

23:18.864 --> 23:21.766
No, it's not that light.
Why is it so heavy?

23:21.768 --> 23:23.134
<i>I mean, it's a Christmas tree.</i>

23:23.136 --> 23:25.904
<i>It's not... you might be thinking</i>
<i>of balsa wood.</i>

23:25.906 --> 23:28.007
<i>Oh, balsa wood.</i>

23:28.009 --> 23:31.410
- And this is?
- This is a balsam fir.

23:31.412 --> 23:35.682
<i>Balsam fir.</i>
<i>Okay, I guess she don't like it.</i>

23:35.684 --> 23:37.317
What else you got?

23:37.319 --> 23:41.656
Well, we got Douglas firs,
something like this.

23:41.658 --> 23:44.826
<i>All right, hold it up though.</i>

23:44.828 --> 23:46.895
<i>You gotta hold it</i>
<i>straight, man.</i>

23:49.800 --> 23:51.201
<i>All right, I got it,</i>
<i>I'm sending it.</i>

23:51.202 --> 23:52.769
<i>Okay, I got it,</i>
<i>I'm sending it to you.</i>

23:52.771 --> 23:55.839
<i>Oh shit, I forgot</i>
<i>to stand next to it.</i>

24:02.348 --> 24:04.215
All right, if you guys are
gonna get coffee every morning,

24:04.217 --> 24:06.718
you gotta get back by 9.

24:07.186 --> 24:09.468
I've been working a 12-hour
shift, I just wanna go to bed.

24:09.690 --> 24:11.457
All right, we work
12 hours too, man.

24:11.459 --> 24:13.225
<i>Yeah, and I'm never late</i>
<i>to relieve you.</i>

24:13.227 --> 24:15.195
It's only 5 minutes,
all right, relax.

24:15.197 --> 24:17.330
You know what?
Is it too much to ask?

24:17.332 --> 24:18.932
I've been sitting out
in the rain all night,

24:18.934 --> 24:20.334
I just wanna go to bed.
Jesus Christ.

24:20.336 --> 24:22.937
- All right.
- You want some muffin?

24:22.939 --> 24:24.405
No.

25:07.858 --> 25:09.258
<i>Do you work here?</i>

25:12.129 --> 25:13.797
<i>I can help you.</i>

25:13.998 --> 25:14.610
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:18.936 --> 25:21.439
<i>These are all</i>
<i>the most beautiful.</i>

25:25.812 --> 25:27.513
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:28.281 --> 25:30.082
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

25:30.350 --> 25:32.552
<i>No, I meet a lot of people.</i>

25:32.554 --> 25:34.821
<i>Do you work nights here?</i>

25:34.823 --> 25:36.156
<i>Just 'til 9.</i>

25:36.158 --> 25:37.825
<i>And who works after 9?</i>

25:37.827 --> 25:40.161
- The night guy.
- Is he here?

25:40.163 --> 25:42.163
<i>He's inside.</i>
<i>Can I help you with something?</i>

25:42.165 --> 25:43.564
<i>No, I just...</i>
<i>I've met him before.</i>

25:43.566 --> 25:46.101
<i>I just need to ask him</i>
<i>a question.</i>

25:47.370 --> 25:50.106
<i>Noel, you got a visitor.</i>

25:51.508 --> 25:53.276
Hi.

25:56.247 --> 25:58.015
Hi.

25:58.449 --> 26:00.284
Do you remember me?

26:01.319 --> 26:03.054
Yeah.

26:03.489 --> 26:05.456
Can I come in?

26:06.225 --> 26:07.993
Okay.

26:12.933 --> 26:17.571
Um, I don't really remember
what happened

26:18.005 --> 26:20.575
or how I got here.

26:25.214 --> 26:29.051
Um, I found you in the park
passed out on a bench.

26:29.986 --> 26:32.055
You found me in the park
passed out on a bench?

26:32.523 --> 26:34.424
Yeah, and you were sitting
next to a homeless man

26:34.426 --> 26:38.028
who had your cell phone,
and you only had one shoe on,

26:38.030 --> 26:39.964
and you had gum in your hair.

26:40.632 --> 26:43.033
<i>And it was freezing,</i>
<i>so I carried you back here</i>

26:43.035 --> 26:46.438
<i>and laid you in bed, and cut</i>
<i>the gum out of your hair.</i>

26:51.144 --> 26:53.246
<i>Yeah, sorry,</i>
<i>I didn't know how to get it out.</i>

26:54.581 --> 26:57.384
<i>Um, and my other shoe?</i>

26:58.519 --> 27:00.654
I didn't see it.
I didn't see a second shoe.

27:03.325 --> 27:06.060
This is pretty embarrassing.

27:07.162 --> 27:10.532
And my wallet?
I lost my wallet.

27:10.534 --> 27:12.501
You didn't see it anywhere?

27:12.720 --> 27:13.169
No.

27:13.170 --> 27:18.008
<i>And you have no idea</i>
<i>how I got there?</i>

27:18.476 --> 27:20.511
No.

27:22.614 --> 27:25.216
<i>All right, well, thanks anyway.</i>

27:47.077 --> 27:48.977
Can I get a holiday riches?

27:49.512 --> 27:52.248
Okay. What else?

27:52.250 --> 27:54.717
And a 6-hour energy.

27:54.719 --> 27:56.353
- Six hour.
- That's it.

27:56.355 --> 27:58.655
<i>That's it?</i>

27:58.657 --> 28:00.724
- Thank you, have a good day.
- Thanks.

28:07.466 --> 28:09.635
Anything I need to know?

28:09.637 --> 28:11.236
This Fraser sold.

28:11.238 --> 28:12.738
The woman's coming back
tomorrow morning.

28:12.740 --> 28:14.341
All right.

28:14.343 --> 28:17.344
Oh, and baler netting,
we couldn't find any.

28:17.346 --> 28:19.079
Should be in the closet.

28:19.081 --> 28:21.983
<i>Actually, neither of us</i>
<i>have ever changed it,</i>

28:21.985 --> 28:25.152
so would you mind
showing us how?

28:25.154 --> 28:26.488
Yeah, I don't like
to waste any,

28:26.490 --> 28:28.423
so I'll just change it
when it runs out later.

28:28.425 --> 28:31.426
I mean, it's easy.
You just gotta figure it out.

28:31.428 --> 28:33.429
All right, see you later.

28:33.431 --> 28:36.032
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what's the deal</i>
<i>with deliveries?</i>

28:36.034 --> 28:36.032
<i>What do you mean?</i>

28:36.034 --> 28:39.403
<i>Well, the sign</i>
<i>says we gladly deliver.</i>

28:39.405 --> 28:41.005
<i>Up to you.</i>

28:41.007 --> 28:42.706
If we deliver
or if we do it gladly?

28:42.708 --> 28:42.706
Either.

28:42.708 --> 28:46.111
<i>Well, I told this woman</i>
<i>that we do it.</i>

28:46.113 --> 28:47.512
Yeah, the day guy
usually takes care of it

28:47.514 --> 28:49.280
at the end of his shift.

28:49.282 --> 28:51.417
- Where is it?
- The other side of town.

28:51.419 --> 28:54.053
- Take the truck.
- Okay.

29:32.834 --> 29:35.435
<i>There is always</i>
<i>the hunter and the hunted,</i>

29:35.437 --> 29:37.604
<i>the pursuer and the pursued.</i>

29:37.606 --> 29:39.506
<i>It may be the voice</i>
<i>of authority</i>

29:39.508 --> 29:41.742
<i>or a race with death</i>
<i>and destruction,</i>

29:41.744 --> 29:44.345
<i>the most relentless</i>
<i>of the hunters.</i>

29:44.347 --> 29:46.614
<i>There are times when laughter</i>
<i>is heard as counterpoint,</i>

29:46.616 --> 29:49.384
<i>and moments when sheer terror</i>
<i>is the theme!</i>

29:54.257 --> 29:56.693
<i>But always, there is the chase.</i>

30:05.637 --> 30:06.738
<i>Come in, my dear.</i>

30:06.739 --> 30:10.742
<i>It was almost unbelievable.</i>

30:10.744 --> 30:12.344
<i>When he recovered</i>
<i>consciousness,</i>

30:12.346 --> 30:16.216
<i>he lay on the floor, staring,</i>

30:16.218 --> 30:18.885
<i>until I summoned</i>
<i>the authorities.</i>

30:33.270 --> 30:34.504
<i>And you sell stands too?</i>

30:34.506 --> 30:36.439
Yeah, you need one?

30:42.247 --> 30:43.681
<i>How does it work?</i>

30:43.683 --> 30:45.550
Three screws through the holes.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.519
And then I fill it with water?

30:50.157 --> 30:51.924
<i>Water. Do I put water in it?</i>

30:51.926 --> 30:54.393
Yeah, water.
Fill it with water.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.463
<i>How often do I refill it?</i>

30:57.398 --> 30:59.399
Whenever it gets empty.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.345
<i>So basically he asked me out</i>
<i>to laser tag,</i>

31:10.347 --> 31:12.581
<i>but I obviously...</i>

31:14.451 --> 31:16.886
hi, do you have the Obama tree?

31:16.888 --> 31:18.488
What?

31:18.490 --> 31:19.924
The Christmas tree
that the Obama's have.

31:19.926 --> 31:24.662
It's the Colorado blue spruce.
It's from Ohio.

31:24.664 --> 31:26.331
Yeah, we have
some blue spruces.

31:26.333 --> 31:27.899
Oh, is it from Ohio?

31:27.901 --> 31:29.968
- Yeah, the seeds are.
- Oh, cool.

31:29.970 --> 31:31.837
It's from here, grown here.

31:31.839 --> 31:33.973
Oh, a local tree.

31:35.676 --> 31:39.646
I don't have to tell you the
Curbers come out of your share.

31:40.615 --> 31:43.551
- Yeah, it'll pick up.
- No one else is so far behind.

31:43.553 --> 31:45.220
<i>Talk to Nick, he's the day guy.</i>

31:45.222 --> 31:46.955
<i>Day guy?</i>

31:46.957 --> 31:49.758
<i>You talked me</i>
<i>into giving you the night shift.</i>

31:49.760 --> 31:51.794
You vouched
for Nick what's-his-name

31:51.796 --> 31:53.929
and his girlfriend.

31:56.434 --> 31:58.235
Sell trees.

32:10.717 --> 32:12.751
Hi.

32:16.924 --> 32:21.829
Listen, I felt a little bad
for the way I acted before.

32:22.330 --> 32:23.664
I should have been
more appreciative

32:23.666 --> 32:25.433
for what you did for me.

32:31.975 --> 32:33.843
<i>It's pumpkin.</i>

32:35.712 --> 32:37.346
What is this?

32:38.516 --> 32:40.284
These?

32:40.286 --> 32:41.852
These are blackberries.

32:41.854 --> 32:44.022
My mom does it.

32:44.657 --> 32:47.859
- Your mom made that?
- No, I made it.

32:49.763 --> 32:51.730
So, did you figure out
what happened?

32:51.865 --> 32:53.432
<i>Psh, no.</i>

32:53.434 --> 32:55.969
<i>I just drank too much.</i>

32:55.971 --> 32:58.638
I think I drank goldschlãger.

33:03.645 --> 33:07.048
- So, this is where you live?
- Yeah.

33:07.050 --> 33:09.651
<i>You're not from here?</i>

33:09.653 --> 33:12.054
No, I live upstate.

33:13.624 --> 33:15.591
You must love this.

33:16.093 --> 33:18.961
- Love this?
- Yeah, the excitement.

33:18.963 --> 33:21.732
I mean, living in a camper
on the streets of New York,

33:21.734 --> 33:24.668
spreading Christmas spirit.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.007
<i>Yeah, I guess</i>
<i>it's a good contrast.</i>

33:29.575 --> 33:31.477
<i>From what?</i>

33:33.714 --> 33:36.048
My regular life, I guess.

33:39.921 --> 33:41.922
So, what do you do
with the leftover trees?

33:43.024 --> 33:44.926
There aren't any.

33:45.094 --> 33:47.962
- Never?
- No.

33:47.964 --> 33:50.399
What if there are?

33:50.401 --> 33:52.901
- There's not.
- Why not?

33:52.903 --> 33:54.870
'Cause we got it down
to a science.

33:54.872 --> 33:58.775
<i>But let's say</i>
<i>divine intervention.</i>

33:59.110 --> 34:03.481
<i>Little baby Jesus comes down</i>
<i>because it's Christmas</i>

34:03.483 --> 34:05.850
and he and the wise men
stand on that corner

34:05.852 --> 34:08.420
and they tell everyone who
comes along not to buy a tree

34:08.422 --> 34:10.688
because they won't
get into heaven,

34:10.690 --> 34:12.991
and people listen, obviously,

34:12.993 --> 34:15.495
'cause it's Jesus
and it's Christmas.

34:17.398 --> 34:18.764
Yeah, well, I guess
in that scenario

34:18.766 --> 34:20.900
we would just leave 'em
on the curb?

34:20.902 --> 34:23.469
- For people to take?
- Sure.

34:23.472 --> 34:27.108
But you have no experience
with this, obviously.

34:29.512 --> 34:32.047
They all end up
on the curb eventually.

34:43.962 --> 34:46.130
This your crew?

34:46.132 --> 34:48.466
Old crew.

34:48.867 --> 34:55.475
<i>Aww, look at you.</i>

34:55.476 --> 34:57.544
<i>That your girlfriend?</i>

34:57.945 --> 35:00.046
<i>Used to be.</i>

35:05.954 --> 35:08.924
Listen, it's Noel, right?

35:09.459 --> 35:11.526
Yeah.

35:11.528 --> 35:13.161
N-o-e-l?

35:13.163 --> 35:16.766
- Yeah.
- Who sells Christmas trees.

35:17.968 --> 35:20.737
Mm-hmm.

35:21.539 --> 35:24.775
Thank you for helping me out
the other night.

36:22.944 --> 36:25.145
Are these all the wreaths
that you have?

36:25.848 --> 36:27.715
There's a couple more up front.

36:28.884 --> 36:33.656
Are there any without all
this stuff on it, just plain?

36:34.691 --> 36:36.292
Nope, just these.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.295
Can you take
all this stuff off?

36:39.730 --> 36:42.799
<i>Like, I don't need this,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

36:43.969 --> 36:46.837
What... you just don't want...

36:48.607 --> 36:51.343
<i>yeah, I don't need this,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

36:51.744 --> 36:54.913
- What do you mean?
- Like, without this.

36:54.915 --> 37:02.917
- You just want a plain wreath?
- Yeah.

37:05.695 --> 37:07.596
- Is that...
- Yeah.

37:07.598 --> 37:10.231
- Do it for $15.
- All right.

37:10.233 --> 37:12.233
- So?
- Thanks.

37:15.205 --> 37:17.073
Yeah, just throw
some hot water on it tonight,

37:17.075 --> 37:17.073
breaks open the sap.

37:17.075 --> 37:22.646
And then just regular tap water
after that, room temperature.

37:24.315 --> 37:26.384
Good to go, thanks.

37:29.989 --> 37:31.957
Hey, what kind of tree is this?

37:33.059 --> 37:35.127
That's a Douglas fir.

37:36.663 --> 37:39.232
- What about this one?
- These are Fraser firs.

37:39.234 --> 37:41.101
What's the difference?

37:41.103 --> 37:43.704
Fraser firs are most popular,
easiest to take care of,

37:43.706 --> 37:45.973
live the longest.

37:45.975 --> 37:47.842
They all have pretty much
the same shape.

37:47.844 --> 37:51.413
Douglas fir, more unique,
you got needles

37:51.415 --> 37:54.249
going all around the branches
to make it look fluffy.

37:55.352 --> 37:57.687
Which do the ladies like?

37:57.689 --> 37:59.255
Probably the Douglas fir.

37:59.257 --> 38:03.694
It has the most smell,
but it requires the most care.

38:05.797 --> 38:09.067
What, like rub their feet?

38:09.069 --> 38:10.669
No, you just gotta...

38:10.671 --> 38:13.939
you can't put it
near sunlight or direct heat.

38:13.941 --> 38:16.909
You got a spray bottle, it's
a good idea to keep it misted.

38:18.211 --> 38:20.247
All right.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.749
Women like 'em?

38:23.051 --> 38:24.785
- Yeah.
- Cool.

38:24.787 --> 38:27.188
Let me... let me see this one.

38:31.761 --> 38:33.295
<i>Nice.</i>

38:33.297 --> 38:35.798
<i>Spin it.</i>

38:39.370 --> 38:41.471
<i>Cool, yeah, I'll take it.</i>

38:41.806 --> 38:43.474
Seventy-two.

38:46.378 --> 38:48.846
- Hey, do you sell lights?
- Yep, white or colored?

38:48.848 --> 38:50.415
<i>White.</i>

38:52.418 --> 38:54.352
<i>Hey, make it two.</i>

38:54.354 --> 38:56.022
<i>You got a couple packs at home?</i>

38:56.024 --> 38:57.457
<i>No, why?</i>

38:57.459 --> 38:59.092
You're gonna need
about four for that tree.

38:59.094 --> 39:02.162
<i>Four, really?</i>
<i>Hey, can you test them.</i>

39:02.164 --> 39:05.733
I got one home last year,
it didn't work.

39:06.234 --> 39:08.169
All right, yeah, come on in.

39:16.513 --> 39:18.380
Nice crib you got here, man.

39:20.518 --> 39:22.185
These are good.

39:25.257 --> 39:26.924
<i>These are good.</i>

39:30.496 --> 39:32.531
What are those, blackberries?

39:32.999 --> 39:34.466
All good.

39:35.301 --> 39:37.437
- Are those blackberries?
- Huh?

39:37.439 --> 39:39.906
<i>Did you make that pie?</i>

39:40.841 --> 39:42.408
No, some girl made it for me.

39:42.410 --> 39:44.445
Your girlfriend?

39:44.946 --> 39:46.347
No.

39:46.349 --> 39:48.783
Some girl stays here one night,
now she's baking pies for me.

39:50.987 --> 39:52.788
<i>Do you need a bag for this?</i>

39:53.256 --> 39:54.856
No.

40:04.869 --> 40:06.804
You want an ornament, free?

40:06.806 --> 40:09.140
No.

40:09.142 --> 40:11.109
You sure?

40:12.211 --> 40:14.013
Yeah, fine, give me one.

40:14.848 --> 40:16.415
You want to pick one out?

40:18.819 --> 40:20.220
The big one.

40:25.327 --> 40:27.094
<i>I don't need change.</i>

41:20.124 --> 41:22.459
<i>It's just one 4-foot Doug,</i>
<i>there's no stand.</i>

41:22.960 --> 41:24.895
<i>Baby, you're dying.</i>

41:25.030 --> 41:27.131
Let me just ask Noel
if he wants to do it.

41:27.366 --> 41:30.936
No, it's just one tree.
I can do it.

41:30.938 --> 41:33.238
<i>All right,</i>
<i>how 'bout I do it then.</i>

41:33.240 --> 41:36.675
<i>Come on, it's pretty small and</i>
<i>it's a first floor apartment.</i>

41:37.978 --> 41:39.379
I can do it, come on.

41:39.381 --> 41:41.514
No, I feel like shit
but I'd rather do it myself

41:41.516 --> 41:43.083
than have you freeze.

41:43.085 --> 41:44.551
It's fine,
I can handle one tree.

41:44.553 --> 41:46.387
I'll do it.

41:53.029 --> 41:55.131
- Coming.
- I got it.

41:55.133 --> 41:56.699
<i>Oh honey, that thing is huge.</i>

41:56.701 --> 41:58.334
Come on in.

42:00.170 --> 42:03.507
- Where do you want it?
- Straight back.

42:20.027 --> 42:21.561
Can I get one of you guys
to hold this up

42:21.563 --> 42:23.229
while I screw this in?

42:23.231 --> 42:25.733
Yeah, I got it.

42:30.005 --> 42:32.341
Still look straight?

42:32.343 --> 42:34.609
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:35.078 --> 42:36.745
Okay, you can let go.

42:51.430 --> 42:53.732
So, we're all set here.

42:53.734 --> 42:55.368
Cool, man,
thanks so much, here you go.

42:55.370 --> 42:56.769
- Great.
- Thanks.

42:56.771 --> 42:59.238
Happy holidays.

42:59.240 --> 43:01.008
You too.

44:18.834 --> 44:20.633
Can I see this one?

44:23.838 --> 44:25.773
<i>No, no, no, that one.</i>

45:07.189 --> 45:10.658
<i>Oh yeah, just tonight,</i>
<i>just throw some hot water on it.</i>

45:10.660 --> 45:14.263
Helps absorb the... helps
the... break open the sap.

45:14.265 --> 45:15.664
Helps absorb better.

45:15.666 --> 45:17.199
And then after that,
just normal...

45:17.201 --> 45:18.768
hey!

45:22.339 --> 45:23.806
<i>You all right?</i>

45:25.510 --> 45:27.178
<i>You okay?</i>

49:35.234 --> 49:37.670
<i>Noel?</i>

49:37.904 --> 49:40.806
Noel? What the fuck, dude?
Wake up.

49:43.177 --> 49:45.011
I just fell asleep.

49:45.013 --> 49:52.587
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

51:13.717 --> 51:16.718
Those are trees?
Behind you, trees?

51:16.720 --> 51:18.053
Yeah, trees.

51:18.055 --> 51:20.890
Yeah, you know,
they look perfect.

51:20.892 --> 51:23.259
Just perfect.

51:23.261 --> 51:26.763
But you see, this
is a Polish neighborhood,

51:26.765 --> 51:31.369
and in Poland,
trees have character.

51:31.837 --> 51:35.740
<i>They are not perfect,</i>
<i>but they have a character.</i>

51:37.077 --> 51:43.883
Like tonight, you go to a forest
and every tree is dressed.

51:44.885 --> 51:51.626
Dressed in a wedding white...
like, brides all of them.

51:52.060 --> 51:56.999
<i>But you must have an axe,</i>
<i>not a chainsaw.</i>

51:57.001 --> 51:59.101
<i>Chainsaw makes noise.</i>

51:59.636 --> 52:01.638
<i>Everybody gets scared.</i>

52:01.640 --> 52:03.706
<i>Trees get scared.</i>

52:07.012 --> 52:08.712
Cheers!

52:09.047 --> 52:10.414
- Cheers.
- Do you work here?

52:10.416 --> 52:11.949
Oh, yeah.

52:11.951 --> 52:13.852
Do you have any decorated ones?

52:13.854 --> 52:16.988
Yeah, there's
a couple of 'em over here.

52:29.270 --> 52:30.905
<i>Are you gonna get more?</i>

52:30.907 --> 52:34.142
I just make 'em myself,
so when we run out,

52:34.144 --> 52:37.946
I'll make a couple more.

52:37.948 --> 52:41.950
- Kinda sad, I know.
- No, this is lovely.

52:41.952 --> 52:44.454
<i>It's perfect.</i>

52:44.456 --> 52:46.723
<i>Mistletoe?</i>

52:46.725 --> 52:48.826
<i>Holly.</i>

52:48.828 --> 52:51.996
<i>Juniper and noble fir.</i>

52:51.998 --> 52:55.801
- Pine?
- Yep, white pine.

52:55.803 --> 52:59.171
- And what's this?
- Western red cedar.

52:59.173 --> 53:01.107
<i>I love it.</i>

53:01.109 --> 53:03.276
<i>I love it.</i>

53:03.278 --> 53:05.478
What about the trees?

53:06.347 --> 53:09.783
<i>We have an artificial tree</i>
<i>where I work.</i>

53:09.785 --> 53:13.154
Everybody loves it,
but I just... i don't know.

53:13.156 --> 53:16.291
I feel like it'd be so much
better if it was a real one.

53:16.293 --> 53:19.929
Yeah, nothing beats
the real thing.

53:19.931 --> 53:21.263
<i>It's not too late, is it?</i>

53:21.265 --> 53:22.898
<i>No, not at all.</i>

53:22.900 --> 53:25.435
<i>A lot of people wait</i>
<i>'til Christmas Eve,</i>

53:25.437 --> 53:27.370
spend all night decorating it.

53:27.372 --> 53:29.806
Wow.

53:30.208 --> 53:32.110
- Do you deliver?
- Yeah.

53:32.112 --> 53:34.112
Can you deliver to bushwick?

53:34.114 --> 53:36.080
Sure.

53:36.082 --> 53:38.884
Earliest I can do would be
tomorrow night, though.

53:38.886 --> 53:40.753
That's all right.

53:40.755 --> 53:42.489
Can you deliver it
Christmas Eve,

53:42.491 --> 53:46.226
and then we can decorate it
like you said?

53:46.228 --> 53:49.463
Yeah, I got a couple more
deliveries Christmas Eve.

53:50.365 --> 53:52.867
Great.

53:52.869 --> 53:52.867
So you want this one?

53:52.869 --> 53:56.304
<i>Yeah, and the wreath.</i>

53:56.306 --> 53:58.240
<i>Okay.</i>

53:58.242 --> 53:59.775
Do I pay for it now?

53:59.777 --> 54:01.110
You can pay for it
when I deliver it.

54:01.112 --> 54:03.212
<i>Oh, great.</i>

54:03.214 --> 54:05.948
<i>Here's the address</i>
<i>and the number is there too.</i>

54:05.950 --> 54:07.918
<i>Okay.</i>

54:07.920 --> 54:09.787
- All right.
- Fantastic.

54:09.789 --> 54:12.323
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

54:24.338 --> 54:26.106
Morning.

54:47.231 --> 54:50.367
- Hey man, how you doing?
- Hey, how's it going out there?

54:50.369 --> 54:54.272
Great, I sold 25 today
and a bunch of wreaths too.

54:54.274 --> 54:56.041
I think we might be out
by tomorrow.

54:56.043 --> 54:59.277
Awesome man, great job.

55:00.146 --> 55:03.916
We're getting
the last load in tonight.

55:03.918 --> 55:05.451
Think you got
one more day in you?

55:05.453 --> 55:07.554
Should be okay.

55:11.192 --> 55:13.061
Tell you what, let me take
care of those deliveries for you

55:13.063 --> 55:14.596
tomorrow night.

55:14.598 --> 55:16.297
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:16.299 --> 55:18.199
That'd be great.

55:18.201 --> 55:20.236
I'm gonna finish up.

55:34.219 --> 55:36.288
- Not bad.
- Few more coming in?

55:36.290 --> 55:38.190
Nope.

55:38.192 --> 55:39.958
- What?
- Too risky.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.894
We're closing down early.

55:41.896 --> 55:44.430
Give me 20 more.
I'll have 'em all sold.

55:44.432 --> 55:47.033
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, you
know how busy the last day is.

55:47.035 --> 55:48.502
Curbers come out of your ass.

55:48.504 --> 55:51.639
There won't be any.

55:52.540 --> 55:54.309
You'll have 15 more tomorrow.

56:10.262 --> 56:14.532
- There you go.
- Oh, great.

56:14.534 --> 56:17.101
- Thank you so much.
- All right, happy holidays!

56:27.983 --> 56:31.485
So, you lookin' for something
a little slimmer or is that...

56:31.487 --> 56:34.021
<i>are you looking for anything</i>
<i>a little slimmer or is this...</i>

56:43.435 --> 56:45.134
<i>merry Christmas.</i>

57:03.992 --> 57:05.658
<i>I need the pan back.</i>

57:06.227 --> 57:08.328
- Excuse me?
- The pie pan, I need it back.

57:08.330 --> 57:08.328
<i>I haven't cleaned it yet.</i>

57:08.330 --> 57:11.498
<i>Please just</i>
<i>give me back the pan.</i>

57:11.699 --> 57:13.568
<i>Are you serious? Yeah, okay.</i>

57:29.153 --> 57:30.688
Is everything all right?

57:38.598 --> 57:41.333
- This look like a 4'?
- Huh?

57:41.734 --> 57:43.336
Yeah, it's a 4'.

57:43.338 --> 57:45.304
Tall 4', but
definitely not a 5'.

57:45.306 --> 57:46.672
Okay.

57:46.674 --> 57:48.275
Don't forget about the one
from last night.

57:48.277 --> 57:50.077
Yeah, it's in the truck already.
You're all good to go.

57:50.079 --> 57:52.379
All right, thanks.

58:21.448 --> 58:23.749
Did you tell my boyfriend
we hooked up?

58:25.119 --> 58:26.553
What?

58:26.555 --> 58:28.755
Why would you do that?

58:29.557 --> 58:31.592
He said he came and bought
a tree from you,

58:31.594 --> 58:34.695
and asked about the pie,
and you said we hooked up.

58:36.699 --> 58:38.366
That guy was your boyfriend?

58:38.368 --> 58:40.469
Yes, why would you say that?

58:40.471 --> 58:41.870
I didn't say anything.

58:41.872 --> 58:43.406
Well, then
why would he think that?

58:43.408 --> 58:46.542
I don't know.
I don't even know him.

58:49.214 --> 58:51.582
Uh...

58:51.850 --> 58:56.488
I think he punched me
in the face yesterday.

58:57.490 --> 58:58.857
What?

58:58.859 --> 59:01.627
Somebody came up and clocked
me from behind and ran away.

59:01.761 --> 59:04.196
Sound like something he'd do?

59:07.368 --> 59:09.169
I think you should go home.

59:09.370 --> 59:11.571
I'm locked out.

59:14.643 --> 59:18.280
Sorry, I just need a minute.

59:27.324 --> 59:29.726
Can I just hang here
for a second?

59:35.934 --> 59:38.303
I gotta go make some
deliveries.

59:39.372 --> 59:41.473
You wanna come?

01:00:27.661 --> 01:00:29.696
<i>Come on in, thanks for coming!</i>

01:00:29.698 --> 01:00:31.332
Sure.

01:00:31.334 --> 01:00:32.733
I drilled a hole,
it should be wide enough.

01:00:32.735 --> 01:00:34.635
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:00:34.637 --> 01:00:36.871
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

01:00:41.277 --> 01:00:42.945
You want this around here?

01:00:42.947 --> 01:00:44.981
<i>Oh, it's perfect, thank you.</i>

01:00:46.617 --> 01:00:48.919
<i>We got our tree</i>
<i>from you last year.</i>

01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:50.487
<i>Oh, great.</i>

01:00:50.489 --> 01:00:53.490
<i>How old is the tree?</i>

01:00:53.492 --> 01:00:56.661
This tree is about 5 years old.

01:00:56.929 --> 01:00:58.463
How old are you guys?

01:00:58.465 --> 01:01:01.400
- I'm 8.
- I'm 5.

01:01:01.402 --> 01:01:03.869
<i>Do you work for Santa?</i>

01:01:05.272 --> 01:01:07.507
Well, we're more
like colleagues.

01:01:08.909 --> 01:01:10.677
What is a colleague?

01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:12.947
People who work together.

01:01:13.415 --> 01:01:15.516
<i>Does that look good, straight?</i>

01:01:21.658 --> 01:01:24.827
- Great, thank you so much.
- Thank you.

01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:28.498
- All right guys.
- Merry Christmas, thank you.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.967
- Enjoy.
- Bye.

01:02:00.704 --> 01:02:02.538
Maybe there's an elevator?

01:02:02.939 --> 01:02:05.607
There's never an elevator.
Is it open?

01:02:05.609 --> 01:02:07.444
Uh, yes.

01:02:24.965 --> 01:02:27.033
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>whose house this is?</i>

01:02:39.482 --> 01:02:41.082
Nice tree.

01:02:41.784 --> 01:02:43.486
Do you know
whose house this is?

01:02:43.488 --> 01:02:45.888
- No.
- Do you know a Matt?

01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:47.924
Oh, I think he's back there.

01:02:49.527 --> 01:02:51.628
<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>

01:03:13.555 --> 01:03:15.556
<i>Hey, there's the tree.</i>

01:03:15.724 --> 01:03:18.059
- Is this your place?
- It is indeed.

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:20.095
Where do you want this?

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:22.564
<i>Right there is fine.</i>

01:03:27.438 --> 01:03:30.441
I'm sorry about before,
the whole pie thing.

01:03:30.708 --> 01:03:32.609
That's all right.
He'll get over it.

01:03:34.446 --> 01:03:36.714
How's your face?

01:03:37.817 --> 01:03:40.051
It's all right.

01:03:40.053 --> 01:03:41.821
I've been punched before.

01:03:44.724 --> 01:03:46.091
You know, I guess
I just got excited

01:03:46.093 --> 01:03:48.595
<i>somebody made a pie for me.</i>

01:04:07.151 --> 01:04:09.786
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

01:04:09.788 --> 01:04:11.789
- Good.
- Thank you for coming.

01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:13.858
<i>Sure, sure, sure.</i>

01:04:16.862 --> 01:04:19.798
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Oh, I'll show you... this way.</i>

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.074
How's it look?

01:05:00.713 --> 01:05:03.181
Ooh!

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.620
It's a hit.

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:12.893
All right.

01:05:14.563 --> 01:05:16.697
They just, they love it,
I can tell you.

01:05:16.699 --> 01:05:18.333
Yeah, great.

01:05:18.335 --> 01:05:21.570
<i>Before you go,</i>
<i>can I give you something?</i>

01:05:21.771 --> 01:05:23.305
<i>Sure.</i>

01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:27.143
<i>This is a tea flower.</i>

01:05:28.278 --> 01:05:32.082
You put it in your cup
of boiling water and it blooms.

01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:35.018
<i>It's very nice.</i>

01:05:35.687 --> 01:05:37.121
- Fair enough.
- I'll walk you guys out.

01:05:37.123 --> 01:05:40.291
- Great, thank you so much.
- Thank you, take care.

01:05:40.293 --> 01:05:42.628
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:46.966
Should I drop you home?

01:05:49.303 --> 01:05:51.037
He's still not answering.

01:05:54.343 --> 01:05:56.210
Can we deliver more trees?

01:06:03.353 --> 01:06:05.253
You can come wait at the stand.

01:06:06.657 --> 01:06:08.124
Okay.

01:06:18.204 --> 01:06:21.139
- You need us to stay?
- No, you guys are good.

01:06:22.174 --> 01:06:24.243
Just see you in the morning
for the breakdown.

01:06:25.312 --> 01:06:27.313
Just one more left.

01:06:27.748 --> 01:06:29.281
Still could sell it.

01:06:30.284 --> 01:06:32.386
- All right guys.
- See you in a bit.

01:07:01.888 --> 01:07:03.455
So, what's next?

01:07:05.124 --> 01:07:06.926
What do you mean?

01:07:06.928 --> 01:07:09.929
<i>You can't sell Christmas</i>
<i>trees all year.</i>

01:07:09.931 --> 01:07:12.733
<i>I build houses</i>
<i>the rest of the year.</i>

01:07:12.735 --> 01:07:14.301
<i>It's pretty dead through march.</i>

01:07:14.303 --> 01:07:18.373
We used to spend
January traveling.

01:07:19.975 --> 01:07:22.243
You know what,
you wanna play some cards?

01:07:22.245 --> 01:07:24.246
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

01:07:31.322 --> 01:07:33.223
<i>What do you wanna play?</i>

01:07:35.994 --> 01:07:39.297
<i>Well, I usually play solitaire.</i>

01:07:41.033 --> 01:07:43.102
<i>Do you want me to watch?</i>

01:07:48.175 --> 01:07:50.443
- Gin rummy?
- Okay.

01:07:52.379 --> 01:07:54.148
<i>Do you know how to play?</i>

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:55.916
Yes I do.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.926
I lost count, was that ten?

01:08:04.928 --> 01:08:07.096
<i>I wasn't counting.</i>

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:15.939
Hey sorry,
I don't really wanna play.

01:08:18.243 --> 01:08:20.278
<i>That's fine.</i>

01:08:29.924 --> 01:08:35.328
- You got that tea flower?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:37.799
<i>Do you have a kettle?</i>

01:08:37.801 --> 01:08:39.867
Sure do.

01:08:45.908 --> 01:08:47.341
<i>Kettle.</i>

01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:52.415
<i>How about something</i>
<i>to put it in?</i>

01:08:52.817 --> 01:08:55.519
Something clear, possibly.

01:08:55.854 --> 01:08:58.488
Yeah, there's a jar over there.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.575
- Wanna take the label off?
- Yes.

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:24.133
- What's going on?
- The generator ran out of gas.

01:13:24.135 --> 01:13:25.767
<i>What time is it?</i>

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:27.636
<i>It's around 3.</i>

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.507
<i>I should go.</i>

01:13:34.845 --> 01:13:36.814
<i>The tea flower.</i>

01:13:41.153 --> 01:13:42.754
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

01:13:43.556 --> 01:13:45.423
<i>Just a second.</i>

01:13:46.305 --> 01:13:52.589
