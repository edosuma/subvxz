00:07.720 --> 00:09.480
<b>What do we do, Zaikahal?</b>

01:36.990 --> 01:42.030
<b>Evil x and x Terrible</b>

01:47.360 --> 01:49.240
<b>His name is Gyro.</b>

01:49.240 --> 01:52.040
<b>And he is the NGL's don in the shadows.</b>

01:55.600 --> 01:59.150
<b>Gyro spent his first twelve years</b>

01:59.150 --> 02:01.300
<b>in a construction camp.</b>

02:02.220 --> 02:03.950
<b>By the time he said his first word,</b>

02:03.950 --> 02:08.800
<b>he'd learned to lay bricks and mix concrete.</b>

02:09.480 --> 02:14.020
<b>His father forced him to slave away...</b>

02:14.020 --> 02:16.420
<b>until Gyro finally killed him and fled.</b>

02:19.990 --> 02:24.330
<b>His father, who raised Gyro 
alone, was a silent man.</b>

02:26.450 --> 02:29.010
<b>When his father returned from work,</b>

02:29.010 --> 02:31.580
<b>he drank cheap liquor by himself 
until he went to bed.</b>

02:32.080 --> 02:37.740
<b>He very rarely talked to Gyro, 
who was on the upper bunk.</b>

02:39.190 --> 02:41.320
<b>Thus, Gyro barely knew</b>

02:41.320 --> 02:45.170
<b>how to speak before the age of seven.</b>

02:47.360 --> 02:50.280
<b>When Gyro returned from work,</b>

02:50.280 --> 02:52.780
<b>he was not permitted to leave his bed,</b>

02:52.780 --> 02:55.700
<b>except when visiting the restroom.</b>

02:56.650 --> 03:01.810
<b>He was allowed to relieve himself twice 
a day, and only before 9 PM.</b>

03:03.060 --> 03:08.430
<b>The bed's rotting wood creaked loudly 
whenever he turned in his sleep.</b>

03:08.880 --> 03:11.420
<b>His father hated that sound.</b>

03:14.350 --> 03:19.540
<b>After his father once severely 
beat him because of that noise,</b>

03:20.110 --> 03:24.090
<b>Gyro learned to sleep without any motion.</b>

03:25.600 --> 03:30.720
<b>He also learned to control his bladder at night,</b>

03:30.720 --> 03:35.110
<b>keeping an empty liquor bottle 
for when he couldn't hold it.</b>

03:36.920 --> 03:39.800
<b>"Don't make trouble for others."</b>

03:40.630 --> 03:46.620
<b>That was the one lesson his 
silent father taught him.</b>

03:47.870 --> 03:52.430
<b>From a young age, Gyro did 
his best to adhere to it,</b>

03:52.430 --> 03:55.240
<b>learning from his mistakes.</b>

03:56.400 --> 04:00.040
<b>Since his father had never 
bought him even one toy,</b>

04:00.650 --> 04:05.140
<b>this lesson was his one and 
only gift from his father.</b>

04:06.360 --> 04:11.750
<b>Within his small world, 
his father was essentially God.</b>

04:12.380 --> 04:16.190
<b>And no matter how cruel his father could be,</b>

04:16.700 --> 04:19.420
<b>Gyro continued to idolize him,</b>

04:19.420 --> 04:23.300
<b>believing that his father needed him.</b>

04:23.930 --> 04:26.160
<b>This belief stemmed from two facts...</b>

04:27.230 --> 04:29.660
<b>When Gyro was five,</b>

04:29.660 --> 04:32.250
<b>a terrible fever nearly killed him.</b>

04:32.900 --> 04:37.610
<b>All night, his father stayed up, 
replacing his towels with fresh ones.</b>

04:40.080 --> 04:41.670
<b>And the other reason was...</b>

04:42.670 --> 04:48.280
<b>that his father had never 
once ordered him to leave.</b>

04:49.540 --> 04:53.500
<b>Gyro was proud of these two facts.</b>

04:54.690 --> 04:56.540
<b>"Idiot...</b>

04:56.540 --> 05:00.940
<b>He hasn't kicked you out 
because you bring in money!"</b>

05:02.150 --> 05:06.730
<b>Though he had previously kept that 
possibility locked away deep in his mind,</b>

05:07.330 --> 05:12.790
<b>Gyro snapped when the older youth 
insensitively brought it to light.</b>

05:13.520 --> 05:19.570
<b>Regretting that he'd revealed his secret, 
Gyro was furious with himself.</b>

05:20.240 --> 05:25.800
<b>His pride wounded, rage overcame 
him, and he attacked the youth.</b>

05:27.210 --> 05:30.830
<b>The youth had always mocked the timid boy,</b>

05:30.830 --> 05:34.520
<b>so when the boy fought back, 
he went mad with anger,</b>

05:34.520 --> 05:39.270
<b>to the point where not even 
knocking him out would satisfy him.</b>

05:40.320 --> 05:43.280
<b>He stomped on the boy's face,</b>

05:43.610 --> 05:47.280
<b>spat on him, and uttered the finishing blow:</b>

05:47.650 --> 05:52.530
<b>"When you were sick, a neighbor took care of you!</b>

05:52.930 --> 05:57.410
<b>Your old man was drinking by himself as always.</b>

05:59.300 --> 06:02.370
<b>You were delirious, so you wouldn't know this.</b>

06:03.100 --> 06:06.960
<b>But that night, the neighbor had 
a fight with your old man.</b>

06:07.580 --> 06:11.000
<b>He asked your dad what he'd do if his kid died.</b>

06:11.670 --> 06:15.830
<b>Let me tell you what your old man said.</b>

06:16.880 --> 06:18.300
<b><i>It wouldn't matter.</i></b>

06:18.300 --> 06:20.810
<b><i>I don't care if he dies.</i></b>

06:21.220 --> 06:22.480
<b>You hear that?"</b>

06:24.280 --> 06:26.670
<b>As Gyro listened to the youth,</b>

06:27.320 --> 06:29.820
<b>he witnessed something inconceivable.</b>

06:39.400 --> 06:42.900
<b>His father looked him in the eye,</b>

06:42.900 --> 06:47.370
<b>paid him no attention, and then left.</b>

06:48.810 --> 06:52.180
<b>That was when Gyro finally understood.</b>

06:54.970 --> 06:58.410
<b><i>The universe doesn't give a damn about me.</i></b>

06:59.670 --> 07:04.820
<b><i>My father doesn't care if I live or die.</i></b>

07:04.820 --> 07:07.850
<b><i>In other words, my life has no meaning.</i></b>

07:09.860 --> 07:12.380
<b><i>If I live, I'll bring in money.</i></b>

07:12.380 --> 07:16.870
<b><i>If I die, I'll just free up a little space. That's all.</i></b>

07:17.440 --> 07:23.880
<b><i>My father told me not to 
make trouble for others</i></b>

07:23.880 --> 07:27.910
<b><i>so as to avoid any inconvenience for himself.</i></b>

07:28.350 --> 07:32.090
<b><i>It was never a lesson to help his son.</i></b>

07:32.090 --> 07:35.080
<b><i>It was fully for his own benefit.</i></b>

07:36.290 --> 07:39.500
<b><i>In that lesson, "others" meant my father.</i></b>

07:39.500 --> 07:40.400
<b><i>No...</i></b>

07:41.490 --> 07:44.280
<b><i>It meant "humans."</i></b>

07:48.880 --> 07:51.400
<b><i>Don't make trouble for humans.</i></b>

07:53.540 --> 07:56.390
<b><i>I must not be human...</i></b>

07:59.000 --> 08:01.800
<b>Eventually, the boy stood up,</b>

08:01.800 --> 08:05.050
<b>grabbing a nearby hammer.</b>

08:13.300 --> 08:17.020
<b>Nine years later, Gyro founded the NGL.</b>

08:17.500 --> 08:22.670
<b>Nine years after that, NGL became 
a nation, with him as its king.</b>

08:24.840 --> 08:29.020
<b>Gyro desired to ruin life for the entire world.</b>

08:29.740 --> 08:36.020
<b>The drug DÂ² was merely the first step.</b>

08:48.870 --> 08:49.930
<b>Yunju!</b>

08:50.620 --> 08:54.220
<b>You handed those humans over to Colt so easily.</b>

08:55.600 --> 08:57.300
<b>I didn't feel like fighting.</b>

08:57.860 --> 09:00.470
<b>Either way, the food will reach the Queen.</b>

09:01.190 --> 09:03.560
<b>I just want to enjoy the hunt.</b>

09:06.460 --> 09:07.560
<b><i>Gyro...</i></b>

09:08.400 --> 09:11.650
<b><i>Damn, I should have just eaten him!</i></b>

09:13.070 --> 09:14.200
<b>Listen up!</b>

09:14.200 --> 09:16.070
<b>I'm taking over this factory!</b>

09:16.700 --> 09:19.310
<b>From today on, this is my fortress!</b>

09:36.910 --> 09:39.260
<b>This is awesome!</b>

09:55.890 --> 09:57.040
<b><i>This is bad.</i></b>

09:57.040 --> 09:59.710
<b><i>These creatures are too dangerous!</i></b>

10:00.030 --> 10:00.770
<b>Look!</b>

10:10.320 --> 10:11.560
<b>What...</b>

10:15.090 --> 10:19.180
<b>What is happening in this place?</b>

10:32.390 --> 10:35.110
<b>What? More dead soldiers found?</b>

10:35.490 --> 10:38.860
<b>Yeah, three of Zazan's were discovered.</b>

10:39.410 --> 10:42.370
<b>Plus, one of mine is missing...</b>

10:42.370 --> 10:45.400
<b>Its communication has been cut 
off, and it hasn't returned.</b>

10:46.200 --> 10:49.610
<b>Yunju's team dealt with the 
humans holding guns.</b>

10:49.610 --> 10:54.040
<b>Does this mean there are other 
humans who are resisting us?</b>

10:54.380 --> 10:56.580
<b>Sounds that way...</b>

10:57.050 --> 11:01.890
<b>But the dead soldiers were killed 
by something that wasn't a gun.</b>

11:02.240 --> 11:03.210
<b>Something?</b>

11:03.710 --> 11:05.390
<b>What could it have been?</b>

11:05.860 --> 11:07.580
<b>How would I know?</b>

11:07.580 --> 11:10.390
<b>Probably some new weapon we haven't seen.</b>

11:13.410 --> 11:15.190
<b>Where are the corpses?</b>

11:15.190 --> 11:17.400
<b>Peggy's examining them above.</b>

11:17.940 --> 11:20.400
<b>This one was killed by a gun.</b>

11:20.400 --> 11:24.160
<b>I'm sure since bullets are still inside the body.</b>

11:24.630 --> 11:26.910
<b>But I'm not sure about the others.</b>

11:28.080 --> 11:30.430
<b>The skull was punctured.</b>

11:30.430 --> 11:32.920
<b>Yes, but not by a gun.</b>

11:33.180 --> 11:35.640
<b>And I had difficulty understanding</b>

11:35.640 --> 11:37.940
<b>the soldiers' explanation of the events...</b>

11:38.410 --> 11:42.430
<b>As it is, the foot soldiers' communications 
are simplistic and just to the point.</b>

11:42.960 --> 11:47.550
<b>They said one human mimicked firing 
a gun, and no projectile emerged,</b>

11:47.550 --> 11:50.930
<b>but something pierced the 
soldier's skulls and they fell, dead.</b>

11:51.290 --> 11:55.780
<b>Can't some soldiers both see 
and feel what's happening?</b>

11:55.780 --> 11:57.380
<b>You're correct.</b>

11:57.380 --> 12:02.200
<b>Those soldiers said that they 
felt a projectile being fired.</b>

12:04.710 --> 12:07.650
<b>So they possess abilities that we do not...</b>

12:08.170 --> 12:11.080
<b>These humans could prove tougher 
opponents than anticipated.</b>

12:12.050 --> 12:16.840
<b>If humans have this power, once we 
inherit their genes, we also will.</b>

12:17.190 --> 12:18.550
<b>We only lack the trait.</b>

12:19.840 --> 12:21.840
<b>You don't understand...</b>

12:21.840 --> 12:25.340
<b>The humans' strength lies
in their ability to learn.</b>

12:25.750 --> 12:28.840
<b>If they learn that the Queen 
is where we're vulnerable,</b>

12:28.840 --> 12:32.750
<b>they'll do whatever it takes to kill her.</b>

12:33.160 --> 12:33.850
<b>Hmm?</b>

12:34.540 --> 12:36.570
<b>You're the one who doesn't understand!</b>

12:37.130 --> 12:42.110
<b>That just means we need to do 
whatever it takes to keep her safe.</b>

12:42.650 --> 12:43.860
<b>Am I wrong?</b>

12:46.310 --> 12:48.870
<b>No, you're correct...</b>

12:51.490 --> 12:52.620
<b><i>That's right.</i></b>

12:53.210 --> 12:54.730
<b><i>I will protect her...</i></b>

12:55.950 --> 12:57.630
<b>I will protect Reina!</b>

12:58.010 --> 12:58.880
<b>Reina?</b>

13:01.230 --> 13:02.840
<b>Who's Reina?</b>

13:02.840 --> 13:05.520
<b>Uh, you're the one who said that name!</b>

13:05.520 --> 13:06.390
<b>I did?</b>

13:06.840 --> 13:08.780
<b>I didn't say anything.</b>

13:08.780 --> 13:10.430
<b>You must be hearing things.</b>

13:11.430 --> 13:13.140
<b>Anyway,</b>

13:13.140 --> 13:16.960
<b>the problem is that humans 
possess multiple weapons</b>

13:16.960 --> 13:19.180
<b>capable of defeating our foot soldiers.</b>

13:21.070 --> 13:22.150
<b>What should we do?</b>

13:22.830 --> 13:24.400
<b>Use their weapons against them.</b>

13:25.210 --> 13:29.160
<b>Give them a taste of their own medicine.</b>

13:29.630 --> 13:33.160
<b>Only soldiers of our rank have the capacity 
to manipulate complex weaponry.</b>

13:33.780 --> 13:36.990
<b>But the humans don't know that.</b>

13:37.430 --> 13:39.600
<b>They must be very frightened.</b>

13:40.070 --> 13:41.170
<b>I understand...</b>

13:43.600 --> 13:47.680
<b>You're a better strategist than I am.</b>

13:52.890 --> 13:54.100
<b>Reina?</b>

14:01.090 --> 14:02.150
<b>It didn't work...</b>

14:02.510 --> 14:04.650
<b>No one received the message.</b>

14:05.220 --> 14:08.910
<b>That means all the other Hunters I was 
in contact with have been taken out.</b>

14:09.410 --> 14:10.690
<b>Oh...</b>

14:11.710 --> 14:12.910
<b>We should leave.</b>

14:14.260 --> 14:17.410
<b>Those creatures are too much for us to handle.</b>

14:17.800 --> 14:21.670
<b>We need to leave NGL and tell 
the world what's happening...</b>

14:22.350 --> 14:24.220
<b>So that an extermination force can be formed.</b>

14:24.220 --> 14:27.180
<b>Whatever... Let's just run for it!</b>

14:28.330 --> 14:29.430
<b>Or we'll all beâ</b>

14:45.780 --> 14:48.320
<b>I-It's here!</b>

14:57.260 --> 14:58.250
<b>Run!</b>

14:58.250 --> 14:59.930
<b>More will be coming!</b>

14:59.930 --> 15:01.230
<b>Hold on, now...</b>

15:02.040 --> 15:05.800
<b>I said to capture the humans alive.</b>

15:06.290 --> 15:09.510
<b>We're supposed to deliver 
them to the Queen fresh.</b>

15:09.830 --> 15:11.500
<b>A-A human face...</b>

15:11.500 --> 15:13.010
<b>What is that thing?!</b>

15:13.330 --> 15:14.150
<b>Fire...</b>

15:14.150 --> 15:15.760
<b>Open fire!</b>

15:16.580 --> 15:18.770
<b>Orange Arrow</b>

15:23.290 --> 15:25.020
<b><i>He grabbed my Orange Arrow,</i></b>

15:25.020 --> 15:27.860
<b><i>fastest of my Rainbow Arrows, with ease.</i></b>

15:29.790 --> 15:33.260
<b>Huh? This is clearly visible.</b>

15:33.260 --> 15:37.370
<b>The grunts couldn't see this?</b>

15:37.940 --> 15:40.390
<b>So the life energy</b>

15:40.390 --> 15:45.630
<b>that surrounds your body is 
what fuels this weapon?</b>

15:46.140 --> 15:51.130
<b>You will make a magnificent 
meal for the Queen...</b>

16:02.310 --> 16:04.690
<b>Balda!</b>

16:14.860 --> 16:18.340
<b>O-Oh, no!</b>

16:18.340 --> 16:21.960
<b>I took a bite without thinking...</b>

16:23.090 --> 16:26.840
<b>Zazan-sama will be angry again!</b>

16:27.250 --> 16:28.550
<b>You bastard!</b>

16:33.270 --> 16:35.390
<b>O-One moment...</b>

16:35.390 --> 16:37.600
<b>My hands are full.</b>

16:42.560 --> 16:44.270
<b>Take this!</b>

16:51.770 --> 16:55.090
<b>As always, you're a disgrace in battle.</b>

16:55.090 --> 16:56.280
<b>Zazan-sama...</b>

16:56.830 --> 16:59.450
<b>Why don't you just drop what's in your hands?</b>

16:59.790 --> 17:00.870
<b>Oh!</b>

17:00.870 --> 17:02.130
<b>You're right.</b>

17:02.500 --> 17:03.800
<b>We're going back.</b>

17:03.800 --> 17:04.460
<b>Hmm?</b>

17:04.880 --> 17:07.960
<b>Since we've obtained some excellent food.</b>

17:08.720 --> 17:13.680
<b>He probably has the nutritional value 
of a thousand normal humans.</b>

17:15.060 --> 17:17.090
<b>Well done, Pike.</b>

17:22.730 --> 17:23.850
<b>Zazan-sama!</b>

17:23.850 --> 17:26.000
<b>I am most grateful for your praise...</b>

17:26.000 --> 17:28.470
<b>You honor me!</b>

17:28.470 --> 17:29.890
<b>Don't forget the food.</b>

17:30.740 --> 17:31.990
<b>Oh, yes...</b>

17:36.650 --> 17:38.400
<b><i>I can't save him myself...</i></b>

17:38.400 --> 17:39.720
<b><i>I have to call for help!</i></b>

17:44.230 --> 17:46.350
<b><i>There's still... There's still time!</i></b>

17:46.350 --> 17:49.910
<b><i>Even if they take him, they 
won't eat him immediately...</i></b>

18:01.300 --> 18:02.180
<b><i>Please...</i></b>

18:02.750 --> 18:06.040
<b><i>Find a Hunter with a strong aura!</i></b>

18:12.700 --> 18:14.940
<b><i>I must hurry back to the border!</i></b>

18:15.650 --> 18:17.070
<b><i>Other Hunters should be thereâ</i></b>

18:45.450 --> 18:47.100
<b>So much fun...</b>

18:55.970 --> 18:58.560
<b>Hunting is so much fun!</b>

19:02.740 --> 19:04.740
<b>Help!!</b>

19:04.740 --> 19:10.750
<b>Help!!

Chimera Ant Nest</b>

19:06.750 --> 19:10.750
<b>Rocky Area</b>

19:08.750 --> 19:10.750
<b>Notify the Hunter Association!!</b>

19:24.220 --> 19:25.710
<b>It'll be dangerous.</b>

19:27.860 --> 19:29.520
<b>But could you accompany me?</b>

19:29.520 --> 19:30.610
<b>Of course.</b>

19:31.070 --> 19:32.620
<b>We're pros.</b>

19:36.230 --> 19:37.150
<b>Miss interpreter...</b>

19:37.550 --> 19:39.690
<b>Sorry, but we're in a hurry.</b>

19:40.300 --> 19:41.370
<b>Yes.</b>

19:41.370 --> 19:44.830
<b>The horses can move a bit faster.</b>

19:45.590 --> 19:47.520
<b>They won't be fast enough.</b>

19:48.680 --> 19:52.670
<b>I want you two to return to 
the border, find the others,</b>

19:52.670 --> 19:54.670
<b>and get word to the Association.</b>

19:54.670 --> 19:56.620
<b>These creatures are dangerous.</b>

19:56.620 --> 19:57.720
<b>Got it.</b>

19:57.720 --> 19:59.670
<b>Be careful, Kite.</b>

19:59.970 --> 20:00.770
<b>Right.</b>

20:02.210 --> 20:04.180
<b>If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind.</b>

20:04.590 --> 20:06.440
<b>Right back at you.</b>

20:06.440 --> 20:08.180
<b>All ready to go!</b>

20:16.710 --> 20:17.730
<b>Let's go.</b>

20:49.610 --> 20:52.100
<b>This is a bullet casing.</b>

20:52.700 --> 20:55.860
<b>Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?</b>

20:56.940 --> 20:59.770
<b>So the underground rulers of NGL</b>

21:00.300 --> 21:03.260
<b>were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.</b>

21:03.830 --> 21:06.810
<b>But judging by this...</b>

21:06.810 --> 21:08.370
<b>It wasn't done by a human.</b>

21:10.270 --> 21:12.800
<b>Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.</b>

21:15.190 --> 21:19.630
<b>If the Chimera Ants are using guns...</b>

21:22.100 --> 21:23.790
<b>I hate to consider the possibility,</b>

21:24.290 --> 21:26.500
<b>but it's possible that NGL's underground rulers</b>

21:26.500 --> 21:29.170
<b>have already been fed to the queen...</b>

21:31.340 --> 21:36.060
<b>What will happen if Chimera Ants 
are born with their genes?</b>

21:38.990 --> 21:41.490
<b>NGL and Chimera Ants...</b>

21:41.890 --> 21:44.920
<b>The worst combination imaginable.</b>

21:46.300 --> 21:49.170
<b>This could create an unprecedented biohazard.</b>

21:52.490 --> 21:57.840
<b>The situation has taken a sudden 
turn for the absolute worst.</b>

23:26.760 --> 23:29.260
<b>Next time: The x Fight x Begins.</b>

23:29.260 --> 23:30.620
<b>Ready...</b>

23:30.620 --> 23:31.510
<b>Set...</b>

23:31.510 --> 23:32.550
<b>Gon!</b>
