WEBVTT

00:18.768 --> 00:20.562
I'm a nice person. I am.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.230
I know how to be nice.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.773
No, you don't.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.151
I do. I'm nice to everybody.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.195
Then why are most of the stories
you've told me the last few days

00:29.279 --> 00:32.073
about you arriving somewhere
and getting punched in the face?

00:32.157 --> 00:35.994
That's because everyone else
is a horrible piece of shit.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.912
-See?
-What?

00:41.416 --> 00:42.917
So, how do we proceed?

00:43.752 --> 00:45.128
Have the Speakers left?

00:45.211 --> 00:46.045
Yeah.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.089
I'm sorry.

00:48.757 --> 00:52.886
In success, you will see them again soon,
in far happier circumstances.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.431
See? He knows how to be nice.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.770
Is it true, then?
The castle can travel somehow?

01:02.479 --> 01:06.816
We know the stories, but sometimes,
it's hard to separate myth from truth.

01:06.900 --> 01:11.321
Tell her about Dracula's castle, Alucard.
Her day can't get any more ruined.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.949
Dracula's castle moves.
How to describe it?

01:15.992 --> 01:19.829
It travels without moving.
It appears at locations as if...

01:20.955 --> 01:22.207
Well, as if by magic.

01:22.707 --> 01:26.085
There has to be some way to trap it.
How do we start?

01:26.669 --> 01:27.879
I want to go home.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.465
Have you been drinking again?

01:30.840 --> 01:33.426
Some chance. But no.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.345
I want to go home.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.806
The old Belmont estate.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.351
I was under the impression
it was destroyed.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.812
Villagers, pitchforks, and torches.

01:44.229 --> 01:48.817
It was. But the value of the old house
wasn't the house itself.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.361
It was what was underneath it.

01:52.278 --> 01:56.199
The Belmont Hold.
Our family library and trove.

01:56.991 --> 02:00.078
The knowledge and material
of generations of Belmonts

02:00.161 --> 02:03.665
who fought the creatures of the night.
Sounds interesting.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.667
If it survives.

02:06.292 --> 02:11.047
If there are solutions to the problems
of finding and killing Dracula,

02:11.589 --> 02:14.467
-they are in the Hold.
-You're guessing, though.

02:14.717 --> 02:18.555
I am guessing.
I can't read or understand magic.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.182
But my family stored
everything they found,

02:21.266 --> 02:25.854
including books of magic and whatever
other weird stuff they came across.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.731
I just can't do anything with it.

02:29.732 --> 02:30.692
But you two can.

02:31.818 --> 02:35.488
Fortunate, then, that I chose
not to kill and eat you, Belmont.

02:36.072 --> 02:40.618
And that I decided against gutting,
flaying, and turning you into shoes.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.912
Such a merry band we are.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.333
I will find us a covered wagon and horses.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.962
If you two can manage
not to kill each other while I'm gone.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.256
Oh, please. We're not children.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.263
-Eat shit and die.
-Yes, fuck you.

03:05.977 --> 03:09.480
You really believe we could find the tools
to kill my father at your old home?

03:09.564 --> 03:12.775
I'll be honest with you,
I don't have a better idea.

03:13.443 --> 03:17.113
I just know that right now,
we are under-equipped for the job.

03:18.197 --> 03:21.159
I'm trusting you, Belmont.
Don't make me regret it.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.454
Everybody regrets it in the end.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.530
No, no, no! Dracula will decide, not you.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.616
Threaten me all you like.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.953
I will die for him
if I don't kill you first.

04:05.036 --> 04:09.457
You do not question my loyalty. All I'm
saying is that our goals can be met

04:09.540 --> 04:12.585
without gleefully paddling
in the blood of children.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.755
Enough.

04:16.297 --> 04:20.677
I told you all that Hector and Isaac
would guide our next steps.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.888
You will cease this infantile squabbling.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.474
I said...

04:26.849 --> 04:28.351
I said cease!

05:01.092 --> 05:02.385
I am Carmilla.

05:03.094 --> 05:06.097
I am come from far Styria
to join the war council.

05:07.557 --> 05:11.936
Your presence was requested
some time ago, Carmilla of Styria.

05:13.146 --> 05:17.233
Indeed.
But your mighty castle keep moves around.

05:18.234 --> 05:23.489
And with such mighty vampire generals
advising you and prosecuting your war,

05:24.157 --> 05:27.660
what use could you have possibly had
for a regional ruler?

05:28.911 --> 05:30.830
And yet, my lord,

05:31.622 --> 05:34.584
your forces were repelled
from a single city-state.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.295
Your generals are in disarray.

05:37.712 --> 05:43.593
So, I feel that, perhaps, it is time
to offer my insights to your great cause.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.014
And what insights have you, Carmilla?

05:49.432 --> 05:52.685
Why was this new wife of yours
never turned?

05:58.608 --> 05:59.650
What did you say?

06:00.401 --> 06:02.987
You married. You had a child.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.407
And yet you did not make her a vampire.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.493
Why was that?

06:09.118 --> 06:11.454
Were you simply keeping a human pet?

06:12.455 --> 06:17.126
And if so, why is vampire society
going to war with the world over it?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.671
I will speak with you alone.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.048
Attend me.

06:45.988 --> 06:46.823
Yes?

06:52.078 --> 06:54.622
You wished to speak to me, my lord?

06:55.081 --> 06:57.625
That was a dramatic entrance, Carmilla.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.545
It was not meant to disrespect you.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.673
It was to unsettle a room full of men.

07:04.006 --> 07:08.177
I prefer in such situations to arrive
with as many advantages as possible.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.930
And how is it that you're here?

07:11.514 --> 07:15.226
Godbrand has been keeping me
apprised of your castle's position.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.979
Your current location
was also advantageous.

07:18.646 --> 07:22.900
And why has Godbrand been
in regular communication with you?

07:24.026 --> 07:26.863
I suspect he still wants to sleep with me.

07:27.738 --> 07:28.614
And will you?

07:30.408 --> 07:31.409
My lord.

07:32.243 --> 07:35.496
From another man,
that would be impossible impertinence.

07:35.913 --> 07:40.918
And yet I prefer to know
my generals' ties and compromises.

07:42.086 --> 07:46.048
I may. If all the other vampire males
in the world drop dead.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.552
And half the females.
Some of the animals.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.390
Very good, Carmilla.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.143
Speaking of impertinence,

07:57.727 --> 08:02.648
you just denounced the choice not to turn
my dead wife in front of all my generals.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.985
What advantage does my anger buy you?

08:06.819 --> 08:07.778
None.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.699
It's a question
they have all been asking themselves.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.661
I gave you an opportunity
to address it, my lord.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.955
Oh, so you were helping.

08:18.414 --> 08:22.585
-Of course, my lord.
-Then why have you only just arrived?

08:23.419 --> 08:27.673
You were summoned some time ago.
Surely I needed help much earlier.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.842
Distractions at home.

08:30.259 --> 08:33.346
Securing my region.
Villagers, pitchforks, torches.

08:34.013 --> 08:34.847
The usual.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.227
Rejoin the others.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.731
Hector and Isaac, my forgemasters,
will be directing our next moves.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.317
I'm sure they would enjoy your help.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.236
As you wish, my lord.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.755
I'm still not completely clear on why
you don't catch fire in the daylight.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.382
I am half-human.

09:10.591 --> 09:14.095
My mother's name was Lisa,
and she was a mortal.

09:15.179 --> 09:18.808
I would very much like to hear the story
of how that happened.

09:20.518 --> 09:24.146
She actually showed up at his front door.
She found the castle

09:24.230 --> 09:26.941
and banged on the front door
with the pommel of her knife.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.526
She sounds interesting.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.486
Oh, she was remarkable.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.739
She beat on the door
until my father let her in

09:33.823 --> 09:36.492
and demanded
he teach her how to be a doctor.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.870
Wait, Dracula taught a human woman
how to be a doctor?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.623
What was first, bloodletting?

09:43.874 --> 09:45.876
God, you still think you're funny.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.878
-My father...
-Dracula.

09:47.962 --> 09:51.173
...is a man of science,
a philosopher, a scholar,

09:51.674 --> 09:54.927
and knows things our society
have forgotten three times over.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.556
Do you still not understand
the enormity of what we're doing?

09:59.098 --> 10:03.436
He's gone mad and from that,
there is no recovering him.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.439
-Shame.
-It's a tragedy.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.817
He's a repository
of centuries of learning.

10:10.234 --> 10:14.238
He could have changed the world.
He might have if Mother hadn't died.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.782
She'd sent him out into the world.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.660
That's why he wasn't there
when the bishops took her.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.078
She sent him away?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.456
She sent him to travel.

10:24.165 --> 10:28.252
To learn the state of the world,
true nature of humans, how they live.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.546
She was turning him.

10:30.963 --> 10:34.967
Imagine if he could have aimed
all that knowledge at improving lives.

10:35.343 --> 10:40.056
If the religious inquisition hadn't proved
his worst instincts about humans.

10:40.139 --> 10:44.268
And now he's going to use her death
as an excuse to destroy the world.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.854
Oh, the world will still be here, Belmont.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.275
Trees will still grow,
birds will still sing,

10:51.651 --> 10:55.988
animals will still hump away
in the undergrowth. But you won't be here.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.449
And you won't be here.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.242
None of you.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.372
The sun will still set,
but you will not see it rise.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.749
There will only be Dracula,

11:07.208 --> 11:10.086
and his war council,
and the hordes of the night.

11:11.253 --> 11:16.133
He writes in great books, you know.
He hews the covers himself from oak

11:16.217 --> 11:20.054
and wraps them in the preserved skin
of the people he hated most.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.264
He writes plans. I've seen them.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.476
Ideas for darkening clouds
and making them as permanent in the air

11:25.559 --> 11:27.103
as the frost of the north.

11:28.312 --> 11:32.858
Strange flying machines that pull shrouds
across the sky to block out the sun.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.193
Imagine it.

11:35.569 --> 11:39.281
A world without humans
under endless invented night.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.784
And Dracula in his castle,

11:42.785 --> 11:45.746
his revenge so complete
there is nothing left to do

11:45.830 --> 11:49.250
but look out over a world
without art or memory or laughter

11:49.333 --> 11:51.419
and know that he did his work well.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.296
That he did it all for love.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.969
-You hear that?
-Animals humping in the undergrowth.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.345
Wait, no.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.433
Which is the nearest town?
Is it still Gresit?

12:05.516 --> 12:06.934
Arges is closer to us.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.515
No further.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.542
Nobody's going to Arges tonight.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.597
You thieving little shit.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.893
I didn't steal anything.
I'm trying to learn.

15:35.976 --> 15:40.356
I found you dying on the street.
I gave you a home and fed you,

15:40.439 --> 15:43.984
and all you were supposed to do
was work quietly and watch my back,

15:44.068 --> 15:47.905
not go behind my back and fuck around
with the tools of my trade.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.824
Sneaking down here,
going through my books.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.619
-I'm sorry.
-What did you think you were gonna learn?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.580
How-- How to help you.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.337
You actually wanted to learn
so you could help me do my work?

16:04.463 --> 16:06.715
-Why?
-Because--

16:08.217 --> 16:10.886
Please don't be angry with me anymore.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.597
Just tell me, Isaac. It's all right.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.684
Because I love you.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.189
Oh, bless your heart.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.067
Even after everything in your life,

16:25.150 --> 16:27.861
you're still a sweet boy
who believes in love.

16:29.196 --> 16:32.533
I'm sorry. I just wanted to help.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.119
Well, I love you, too.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.957
That's why I do this.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.376
This is how I love you.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.379
This is how I teach you.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.175
You stop fucking around,
you do as you're told,

16:50.259 --> 16:52.761
you never use the word love again.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.019
No. Isaac.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.329
No such thing as love in this world.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.005
From a party sent to Arges.

17:28.714 --> 17:33.802
-It died 20 yards from our door.
-Arges is some distance.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.804
He must have flown all night.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.475
Why do you do that, the whipping?

17:40.434 --> 17:42.686
Discipline, peace.

17:43.437 --> 17:48.776
Choosing my own actions
and inuring myself to a world of horrors.

17:49.818 --> 17:53.906
Oh, come on, wake up.
We have a horror right here for you.

17:59.578 --> 18:05.501
Imagine, so horribly injured
and so determined to come back to us.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.213
And crapping out a minute
before it managed it.

18:09.755 --> 18:14.301
Useless fucking thing.
Now do your filthy human magic with it.

18:30.692 --> 18:31.652
I'm sorry.

18:32.736 --> 18:36.949
You struggled so hard
to come back home. So loyal.

18:38.742 --> 18:43.580
Perhaps this is all loyalty buys,
in a world without love.

18:44.373 --> 18:49.837
Pain in the night
and death on your master's floor.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.257
Perhaps that's all that awaits me, too.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.009
But you didn't mind.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.054
You came home regardless.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.851
The lesson here
is that I shouldn't care either.

19:04.810 --> 19:10.149
Dracula will bring a pure world
into being. I believe that.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.359
I believe him.

19:13.360 --> 19:19.324
I want, of all things, a pure world,
a clean world,

19:20.325 --> 19:24.496
where there is only loyalty
and only love.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.353
You're so alone.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.608
We have to accept that we've lost
the party sent to Arges.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.194
Taking Arges is bloodshed
for its own sake.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.570
There is no strategy here.

19:56.653 --> 19:59.364
Arges has no real importance.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.909
You should have counseled
an attack on Braila.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.786
-Why Braila?
-If you were serious

20:04.870 --> 20:07.289
about serving our lord's war,
you would have seen

20:07.372 --> 20:10.709
that taking the biggest river port town
in the region was important.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.171
If you take Braila,
you prevent escape from Wallachia.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.592
Any city built over running water
is a place that we,

20:18.675 --> 20:22.012
as vampires, should approach carefully.

20:23.722 --> 20:27.976
Running water? I've never heard
of that affecting vampires.

20:28.060 --> 20:32.272
Death by running water
hasn't happened in many centuries.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.358
-Why not?
-Look around.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.360
We moved into the middle of countries.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.196
I'd been told that vampires
couldn't cross running water.

20:39.571 --> 20:43.367
-I've been on boats. I've had baths.
-When?

20:43.825 --> 20:46.787
-Baths aren't running water, are they?
-Course they are.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.414
How can baths be running water?

20:49.498 --> 20:52.125
The water's stopped being poured
when you get in.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.336
The Greeks used to bury us
on small islands,

20:54.419 --> 20:57.464
because the graves would be surrounded
by running water.

20:57.547 --> 21:02.386
I think I would probably feel
like running water would kill me.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.764
Really? Do you feel like poison
would kill you?

21:05.847 --> 21:08.016
Of course you don't.
It's a thing you learn.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.478
It's not like we're given a manual
for being a vampire.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.396
Enough!

21:15.941 --> 21:18.819
Do you really think that's enough, Hector?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.405
Power is what matters in this world.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.534
I do not see how securing Braila
over Arges gives us power.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.704
Arges is an old, respected town.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.499
I must respectfully disagree
with my fellow forgemaster.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.753
Taking Arges brings only terror
and will scatter the human populace.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.382
Taking Braila seals off
one side of Wallachia.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.051
Interesting, Hector.

21:45.470 --> 21:49.016
I must disclose that I revived
the creature that returned.

21:49.099 --> 21:52.311
The party was attacked on the road.
Their assailants are unknown,

21:52.894 --> 21:55.689
but Arges is close to Gresit.

21:57.607 --> 22:01.653
We are quite certain
that Alucard sleeps at Gresit.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.699
And that there was recently
a Belmont there.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.245
A Belmont? I thought they were extinct.

22:10.329 --> 22:15.167
No. We believe our lord's son, Alucard,
and the Belmont may have worked together

22:15.250 --> 22:17.336
to repel our forces at Gresit.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.298
If there is a Belmont left alive,
then should we not observe

22:21.381 --> 22:23.842
-the ancestral Belmont home?
-Why?

22:24.217 --> 22:27.345
Perhaps on the general notion
that the Belmonts hunted the likes of us

22:27.429 --> 22:30.599
for fucking centuries.
And if there's one left alive,

22:30.682 --> 22:34.227
then it may have access to the trove
of weapons and magical materials

22:34.311 --> 22:36.980
talked of across generations
but never found,

22:37.064 --> 22:40.150
which they used to hunt us
through fucking centuries.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.070
Am I making myself clear now?

22:44.571 --> 22:46.865
This is your War Council, my lord?
