- Using me as his heavy bag.

18:14.101 --> 18:16.203
- Alright, well, that's
gonna end today, okay?

18:16.303 --> 18:18.372
Now, first of all, being
physical is not always

18:18.472 --> 18:21.542
the best way to resolve things,
okay?

18:21.642 --> 18:24.111
Matter fact, maybe I
could talk to his dad.

18:24.211 --> 18:26.414
- Nah, he's in jail
for armed robbery.

18:26.514 --> 18:28.683
He literally stole someone's
fake arm, and ran with it.

18:30.217 --> 18:31.452
- That's not an option.

18:31.552 --> 18:35.389
Alright, um, well, you're gonna
have to outsmart him.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.590
- Yeah.

18:36.691 --> 18:38.326
- JEREMY: Okay, okay,
let's get this handled.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.523
- Yeah, okay. Alright, yeah,
yeah, just let me know

18:43.623 --> 18:46.125
when you get in contact
with the administrator.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.895
Okay, alright, okay,
thanks, bye-bye.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.197
- Well, a loads been lifted.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.066
- And now we can move forward.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.834
- Just the person
we need to see.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.437
I was able to get a swab
of Efe's saliva.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.106
- Oh, ugh!
- We needed you to test it,

19:00.206 --> 19:01.541
so we could see
if he was a king.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.876
- A king? Where did you get
that idea from?

19:03.977 --> 19:05.111
- Uh, we was watching the news,

19:05.211 --> 19:06.980
and it said it's an African king
on the loose,

19:07.080 --> 19:08.948
so we thought it was him.
- VINNY: Yeah.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.183
- <i>audience laughing</i>

19:10.283 --> 19:13.653
- Efe is clean,
his background check cleared.

19:13.753 --> 19:14.988
- I figured as much.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.090
See, so he's not
who we thought he was.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.425
- Who did you think that I was?

19:19.525 --> 19:22.061
- It wasn't my fault,
I promise you, Efe,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.364
it was these three stooges.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.000
They tried to convince me
that you were a scammer,

19:27.100 --> 19:28.301
and I knew you weren't.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.703
And then, there was
a story on the news

19:30.803 --> 19:33.473
that said that there
was an African king loose,

19:33.573 --> 19:36.576
and so they wanted me
to get your saliva

19:36.676 --> 19:38.311
so that they could
check to see if it was you.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.679
- She lying!
- She lying!

19:39.779 --> 19:41.748
She's a damn snitch,
she's a damn snitch!

19:41.848 --> 19:45.852
- CORA: Would you stop cussing?
- LEAH: Please?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.587
- Is that right?

19:47.687 --> 19:51.057
- Oh, we are so sorry, Mr. Efe.
We--we just--

19:51.157 --> 19:52.191
- Is it because
I'm African, right?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.126
- Yeah.
- MR. BROWN: Yeah.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.227
- That's okay,

19:54.327 --> 19:56.596
I get that stereotype
all the time.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.031
It's just that usually

19:58.131 --> 20:01.267
I'm mistaken for a very famous
Harvard trained gynecologist.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.537
- You did, you did?
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.307
This is why you have to be
careful not to stereotype

20:07.407 --> 20:09.676
and get to know people
for ourselves.

20:09.776 --> 20:13.112
You can't believe everything
that you hear or see on TV.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.849
They show black men as thugs,
but it is not true.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.118
We are good, hard-working,

20:19.218 --> 20:22.121
God fearing, loving,
intelligent people.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.757
- MR. BROWN: Yes, Lord.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.660
- Mr. Omowale is a--
a car dealership owner.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.329
He's well respected.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.563
- And, you know what,

20:30.663 --> 20:33.099
that CrookedFolk.com,
that's a satire site;

20:33.199 --> 20:34.367
none of that stuff
on there is real,

20:34.467 --> 20:36.869
stay off of there.
- Not real.

20:36.970 --> 20:41.007
- Well, could you ever forgive
us for stereotyping you?

20:41.107 --> 20:44.510
- Of course, I forgive you.
We are all stupid sometimes!

20:46.079 --> 20:47.547
- Well, if I can say this,

20:47.647 --> 20:51.017
uh, welcome to the
Pleasant Days family!
