02:39.777 --> 02:42.970
Children of the night... shut up!

03:01.098 --> 03:02.892
Renfield!

03:03.396 --> 03:05.386
Renfield!

03:07.272 --> 03:08.807
Yes, master.

03:08.907 --> 03:10.809
I was getting the magazines, master.

03:10.909 --> 03:14.179
How many times do I have to tell you,
body temperature.

03:14.279 --> 03:15.839
Yes, master.

03:16.515 --> 03:20.146
Lots of ladies in the altogether
for you to drool over.

03:22.587 --> 03:24.147
Trash.

03:24.389 --> 03:25.881
Filth.

03:28.593 --> 03:30.290
Pornographic!

03:31.329 --> 03:33.031
Where is my fashion magazine?

03:33.131 --> 03:36.125
Whatever master wants, master gets.

03:40.006 --> 03:41.634
There she is.

03:42.008 --> 03:44.103
Cindy Sondheim.

03:44.944 --> 03:49.540
I tell you, Renfield... every time
I see her, I am more sure it's her.

03:49.849 --> 03:52.683
The only woman I have ever loved.

03:53.452 --> 03:54.954
Please, master...

03:55.054 --> 03:59.358
that's the same thing you said
about the Countess de Montespan in 1672.

03:59.458 --> 04:03.356
That was sex, Renfield... this is love.

04:03.596 --> 04:07.757
This one has a soul... a very old soul.

04:08.067 --> 04:10.629
A soul I have known before.

04:11.405 --> 04:15.070
I bit her once in Warsaw,
in thirteen hundred and...

04:16.410 --> 04:18.334
Thirteen hundred and...

04:18.445 --> 04:21.837
- Renfield!
- 56, master.

04:22.015 --> 04:23.404
Yes.

04:23.684 --> 04:26.780
Yes, 1356, Warsaw, I bit her once.

04:28.322 --> 04:31.191
I met her again in England
in nineteen hundred...

04:31.291 --> 04:33.852
- 31.
- 31!

04:35.095 --> 04:37.064
Two bites that time...

04:37.164 --> 04:40.362
I knew her as Mina Harker.

04:40.601 --> 04:43.671
But I lost her in that damn London fog.

04:43.771 --> 04:45.740
I'll never forget it, master.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.038
That was the time
Dr. Van Helsing nearly got you.

04:49.444 --> 04:54.349
If it hadn't been for that cigarette case
I gave you for your 650th birthday...

04:54.449 --> 04:58.080
he would have driven that stake
right through your heart.

04:58.753 --> 04:59.821
What?

04:59.921 --> 05:03.449
He would have driven that stake
right through your heart.

05:03.891 --> 05:05.793
So what do you want from me, a medal?

05:05.893 --> 05:07.521
Sorry, master.

05:10.198 --> 05:13.601
Cindy and I are going down
to the cellar to take a little nap.

05:13.701 --> 05:16.104
- Master, please be careful!
- What is it?

05:16.204 --> 05:18.440
You nearly stepped on my dinner.

05:18.540 --> 05:20.134
Forgive me.

05:21.777 --> 05:23.303
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

05:23.946 --> 05:26.215
- Renfield!
- Yes, master?

05:26.315 --> 05:28.984
Didn't mean to bother you
while you are eating.

05:29.084 --> 05:32.112
When you are finished, tidy up a bit.

05:32.921 --> 05:34.754
Certainly, master.

05:41.864 --> 05:45.290
"Cheating on your honeymoon can be fun.

05:46.201 --> 05:48.771
"How to get your gynecologist
to tear up his bill...

05:48.871 --> 05:51.866
"by yelling rape in the office.

05:52.275 --> 05:55.803
"The 10 best states
to divorce your old man in.

05:56.446 --> 06:00.475
"Husband-beating.
Ten men tell why they like it."

06:00.817 --> 06:02.616
Sick.

06:03.553 --> 06:05.716
Cindy Sondheim...

06:06.122 --> 06:09.150
one day I will take you away
from all of this.

06:12.996 --> 06:15.489
Wake up, master!

06:22.072 --> 06:24.308
Master, there's someone at the door.

06:24.408 --> 06:28.073
They want to see you.
I think they are from the government.

06:29.580 --> 06:32.450
- How do you know?
- They are wearing shoes.

06:32.550 --> 06:36.354
"And therefore by a unanimous vote
of the Central Committee...

06:36.454 --> 06:39.123
"it has been decided
to turn this castle...

06:39.223 --> 06:42.490
"into a training camp
for our young athletes."

06:42.960 --> 06:46.464
You and your cockroach-eating friend
over there...

06:46.564 --> 06:49.524
have 48 hours to get out!

06:49.767 --> 06:52.431
Good evening, Comrade Count.

06:57.909 --> 06:59.742
Wait one minute.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.945
This is my home.

07:04.082 --> 07:06.284
My people cleared the land.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.620
We tortured innocent peasants for it.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.689
We even murdered for it.

07:10.789 --> 07:14.124
By Romanian law, that makes it ours.

07:15.026 --> 07:17.951
Now you listen to me, stupid.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.933
In 48 hours, we will be back here...

07:22.033 --> 07:25.470
with trampolines,
parallel bars, swings...

07:25.570 --> 07:29.497
and Nadia Comaneci. Don't be here!

07:29.941 --> 07:31.604
Don't be here?

07:33.045 --> 07:34.844
Where am I to go?

07:35.915 --> 07:38.579
You have a choice, Comrade Count.

07:38.818 --> 07:43.245
Either you spend the rest of your life
in an efficiency apartment...

07:43.756 --> 07:46.826
with seven dissidents and one toilet...

07:46.926 --> 07:51.786
or you gather your aristocratic
shit together and split.

08:01.007 --> 08:02.635
Renfield!

08:03.644 --> 08:05.375
Yes, master.

08:06.079 --> 08:08.470
What is an efficiency apartment?

08:09.449 --> 08:11.373
I don't know, master.

08:12.052 --> 08:13.714
What's a toilet?

08:19.159 --> 08:20.548
Get the monster.

08:20.894 --> 08:23.922
The horses are harnessed, master.
It's time.

08:24.932 --> 08:27.960
So they've come to pay their respects,
have they?

08:30.404 --> 08:32.272
Not exactly, master.

08:32.371 --> 08:34.975
Perhaps it would be better
if you left in your coffin.

08:35.075 --> 08:37.706
I could take it off the carriage.

08:43.585 --> 08:46.112
Me, afraid of townspeople!

08:46.354 --> 08:48.779
A bunch of yokels.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.283
Come, Renfield...

08:52.627 --> 08:55.427
we will give them a run for their money.

09:20.389 --> 09:22.381
Get the wolfsbane.

09:22.958 --> 09:24.689
Get your wolfsbane.

09:25.961 --> 09:28.795
Torch him in the boat.

09:30.399 --> 09:32.426
Hang him by his heels.

09:33.168 --> 09:36.196
What do you want from him? Blood?

09:42.077 --> 09:45.709
You dirty bat, you bit my mother.

09:47.617 --> 09:51.248
- What is your name?
- Alexei Rugalov.

09:53.089 --> 09:58.358
No, Alexei, I bit your mother,
and your grandmother.

10:18.916 --> 10:23.213
And you, my child...
are you not afraid of Count Dracula?

10:27.024 --> 10:31.053
You see, even a child knows.

10:32.229 --> 10:36.258
The wolf is
a very misunderstood creature.

10:37.268 --> 10:41.399
He never kills for sport,
only what is needed.

10:43.274 --> 10:47.132
And he always protects the young.

10:48.079 --> 10:49.639
And the old.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.616
Have your fun.

11:03.161 --> 11:05.330
But remember this...

11:05.430 --> 11:09.534
without me, Transylvania will be
as exciting as...

11:09.634 --> 11:12.594
Bucharest on a Monday night.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.647
Pardon me, would you like
Chicken Kiev, Chateaubriand...

11:54.747 --> 11:57.013
or Veal Cutlet Florentine for lunch?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.320
Everything you mention is dead.

11:59.420 --> 12:02.914
Don't you have anything
that's alive and kicking?

12:03.590 --> 12:06.117
I'll have the Chicken Kiev, miss.

12:07.161 --> 12:10.397
Why don't you bring a nice juicy mouse
for little Salome here?

12:10.497 --> 12:12.421
Could I have one, too?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.663
That's funny.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.237
"American slang.

12:25.612 --> 12:29.072
"Putting on the ritz,
getting dressed up.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.848
"Flapper, a girl.

12:32.087 --> 12:34.614
"Hotsy-totsy. Boo-boop-be-do.

12:34.923 --> 12:36.620
"Red-hot mama.

12:37.158 --> 12:40.391
"Twenty-three skidoo." What is this?

12:42.964 --> 12:45.662
"Copyright, 1926."

12:46.167 --> 12:50.271
Renfield, you bungling moron,
this book is as out of date as...

12:50.371 --> 12:51.760
I am.

13:09.892 --> 13:14.626
<i>Passengers for Flight 330,</i>
<i>please board immediately at Gate 5.</i>

13:18.134 --> 13:19.535
All right, what have you got?

13:19.635 --> 13:22.972
Nothing, just a sitar
I bought in Bangladesh.

13:23.072 --> 13:24.807
Bangladesh.

13:24.907 --> 13:28.644
Okay, strip him down, look in his eyes,
look in his ears, look in his nose...

13:28.744 --> 13:32.081
and have him bend over
and touch his toes and look up there.

13:32.181 --> 13:33.783
Lousy hippies!

13:33.883 --> 13:36.652
What have you got to declare over $100?

13:36.753 --> 13:38.121
Nothing, sir.

13:38.221 --> 13:40.885
Oh, yeah? Then what's in there?

13:41.091 --> 13:43.393
All that's left of my father.

13:43.493 --> 13:46.563
I'm bringing him home
so I can bury him next to my mother.

13:46.663 --> 13:48.732
That's his passport right there.

13:48.832 --> 13:50.961
What did he die of?

13:51.067 --> 13:55.238
He was half eaten by a lion
while he was on safari in Africa.

13:55.338 --> 13:59.037
What was left, the vultures got at.
Would you like to see?

13:59.476 --> 14:02.646
They chewed away his eyes
and his nose and his mouth.

14:02.746 --> 14:06.638
But you can still identify him.
He's in three rather large pieces.

14:10.321 --> 14:12.154
Get out of here.

14:14.025 --> 14:15.414
Next!

14:21.065 --> 14:25.333
Alvin, I told you to go find your roots.

14:26.003 --> 14:29.600
But who told you to drink the water?

14:32.577 --> 14:37.311
<i>Passengers for Flight 330,</i>
<i>please board immediately at Gate 5.</i>

14:37.915 --> 14:42.220
<i>Flight 217, now boarding at Gate 5.</i>

14:42.320 --> 14:45.023
Sir, would you like
limo service to New York?

14:45.123 --> 14:46.925
Thank you very much.

14:47.025 --> 14:49.394
And for you, only $25.

14:49.494 --> 14:51.630
Hey, pal, why pay a limo
to carry this thing?

14:51.730 --> 14:54.099
I got a private car. Air-conditioned.

14:54.199 --> 14:57.033
$10 flat. No tip. What do you say?

14:57.636 --> 15:02.132
Master, there is a gentleman here
that says he'll take us into town for $10.

15:02.441 --> 15:04.443
Master, what should I do?

15:04.543 --> 15:08.347
All right, enough with the number
already, $7.50.

15:08.447 --> 15:12.283
- But you carry the master.
- I always do.

15:15.554 --> 15:17.582
Come along now, master.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.979
I knew Brother Alvin.

15:41.748 --> 15:43.516
And he was a swinger.

15:43.616 --> 15:45.608
Praise the Lord.

15:48.187 --> 15:50.180
He loved his booze.

15:52.293 --> 15:54.495
He loved his women.

15:54.595 --> 15:56.587
And my wife, too.

15:57.364 --> 16:01.291
But most of all,
he loved his Cadillac Seville.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.934
And it's a beaut.

16:04.838 --> 16:08.435
I know because he left it to me.
Hallelujah.

16:09.810 --> 16:10.978
Praise the Lord.

16:11.078 --> 16:13.547
I showed him how God...

16:13.647 --> 16:16.914
wanted him to have a swell time
while he was alive.

16:18.952 --> 16:21.121
Because, brothers and sisters...

16:21.221 --> 16:23.525
when you is gone...

16:23.625 --> 16:25.424
you is gone.

16:25.627 --> 16:28.363
And ain't no way, nohow...

16:28.463 --> 16:32.196
nobody's gonna bring you back here
once you is dead.

16:38.573 --> 16:40.201
Good evening.

16:45.413 --> 16:47.282
I am Count Dracula.

16:47.382 --> 16:51.274
I would like a large suite with a bath.
I have a reservation.

16:57.626 --> 17:00.995
This is not the lobby
of the Plaza Hotel?

17:17.079 --> 17:19.810
Hey, you. What's shaking, honky?

17:20.849 --> 17:21.884
Good evening.

17:21.983 --> 17:26.582
Forgive me, but could you direct me
to where I might find a taxi?

17:26.888 --> 17:30.894
There ain't none.
They scared to come up here after dark.

17:30.994 --> 17:32.462
Honky.

17:32.562 --> 17:37.200
A honky? I am not a honky.
I am Romanian.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.370
You mean you was a Romanian, mother.

17:40.470 --> 17:42.172
Hey, man, did you see <i>Roots?</i>

17:42.272 --> 17:45.609
I wouldn't mess with him.
His grandfather was a Watusi.

17:45.709 --> 17:47.978
A Watusi. A warrior.

17:48.078 --> 17:51.248
The time is late, the man is tall...

17:51.348 --> 17:54.717
but I got a date, so he must fall.

17:59.022 --> 18:00.980
Let me have the mother.

18:04.162 --> 18:06.792
It's thanksgiving time, turkey.

18:20.011 --> 18:23.348
I ain't with these guys.
These brothers were just standing here.

18:23.448 --> 18:26.874
Now I know my way home,
so you don't have to show me.

18:35.993 --> 18:39.659
It's dudes like you
that give the neighborhood a bad name.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.794
<i>Raid!</i>

18:43.202 --> 18:45.437
<i>Raid, house and garden bug killer.</i>

18:45.537 --> 18:48.807
<i>Indoors or outdoors,</i>
<i>Raid hunts bugs down like radar.</i>

18:48.907 --> 18:50.809
<i>And kills them dead.</i>

18:50.909 --> 18:53.641
<i>- I win!</i>
<i>- You lose.</i>

19:04.690 --> 19:06.114
Master!

19:06.758 --> 19:08.989
Happy to see you, too, master.

19:11.698 --> 19:14.430
You psychotic, bungling moron.

19:15.301 --> 19:17.504
There is a dead schwartz in there.

19:17.604 --> 19:18.905
That's impossible!

19:19.005 --> 19:22.636
Don't tell me impossible.
Look, go on, look for yourself.

19:25.745 --> 19:28.409
Maybe he's just a late sleeper.

19:29.916 --> 19:32.352
I'll have them get rid of it
immediately, master.

19:32.452 --> 19:36.413
- After that, you'll arrange to get my coffin.
- Yes, master.

19:36.589 --> 19:38.458
Meanwhile, I'm resting.

19:38.558 --> 19:42.962
You will go to make discreet enquiries
as to the whereabouts of Miss Cindy.

19:43.062 --> 19:47.499
I bought an American suit...
so I'll look just like everyone else.

19:47.635 --> 19:49.970
I seriously doubt that, Renfield.

19:50.070 --> 19:51.835
Nevertheless.

19:53.407 --> 19:55.543
By the time I arise tomorrow evening...

19:55.643 --> 19:58.238
the sun sets at...

19:58.712 --> 20:01.115
7:52, master.

20:01.215 --> 20:05.779
By 7:53, I want to know
where Cindy Sondheim lives.

20:06.086 --> 20:09.182
But not for long. Right, master?

20:30.545 --> 20:32.344
You can go in now.

20:45.260 --> 20:48.595
Didn't I see him on <i>Fantasy Island?</i>

20:49.331 --> 20:54.692
Now, you expect me to introduce my most
successful model to your employer...

20:54.870 --> 20:56.806
this Count something.

20:56.906 --> 21:00.207
- What did you say his last name was?
- Dracula.

21:00.743 --> 21:02.712
- Count Dracula?
- Correct.

21:02.812 --> 21:05.407
- The Count Dracula?
- Yes.

21:09.151 --> 21:11.521
Bob Evans from Paramount sent you,
didn't he?

21:11.621 --> 21:13.456
I mean this is a joke, right?
It's a gag.

21:13.556 --> 21:14.991
Crazy Bob, what a lug.

21:15.091 --> 21:17.686
No. I'm not joking.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.631
My master would like very much
to meet Miss Sondheim.

21:21.731 --> 21:25.669
I'm sure he would be willing to give you
a commission if you could arrange it.

21:25.769 --> 21:27.704
How much of a commission?

21:27.804 --> 21:32.038
Well, he might make you a colonel
in the Royal Transylvanian Army.

21:32.242 --> 21:35.577
That is, when the next
free elections will be held.

21:37.481 --> 21:38.482
All right, you freak.

21:38.582 --> 21:42.941
You have 30 seconds to get out
of my office or I call the security guard.

21:44.388 --> 21:49.725
You have 30 seconds to tell me
where Miss Sondheim is or...

21:50.427 --> 21:53.853
Or what?
You will eat your lunch in my office?

21:53.964 --> 21:57.892
No, my lunch will eat you.

22:06.678 --> 22:10.138
What is that? Oh, my God.

22:13.151 --> 22:17.544
Central Park, 9:00. Christ!

22:32.971 --> 22:36.041
Pose like that. I like that.

22:36.141 --> 22:39.612
You're angry. You're not angry.

22:39.712 --> 22:42.281
You're a happy woman.

22:42.381 --> 22:44.112
Now you're angry.

22:45.017 --> 22:47.942
Smile.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.923
Beautiful. Little to the left.

22:51.023 --> 22:52.890
Pet the dog.

22:54.193 --> 22:55.753
Smile.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.335
Come on, buddy. Step back.

23:35.435 --> 23:37.238
I've come a long way to see her.

23:37.338 --> 23:40.969
You and about 1,000 other schmucks.
Now, step back, buddy.

24:06.534 --> 24:08.162
What the...

24:13.875 --> 24:15.299
Get that dog!

24:28.790 --> 24:31.886
Hold still, Cindy.
He's not going to bite.

24:34.062 --> 24:36.031
Hi. What are you doing here?

24:36.131 --> 24:38.726
Stop that. That tickles.

24:39.134 --> 24:41.559
Would you stop it?

24:44.407 --> 24:45.796
You're cute.

24:45.908 --> 24:48.469
- Come on.
- Wait. Hey!

24:50.680 --> 24:52.582
Nobody pees on New York's finest.

24:52.682 --> 24:54.572
Right to the dog pound.

25:11.300 --> 25:14.635
Renfield.
You will do two things in the morning.

25:15.538 --> 25:17.875
You will locate Miss Cindy Sondheim...

25:17.975 --> 25:21.912
and you will go to Dunhill Tailors,
and buy me three new tailcoats.

25:22.012 --> 25:23.280
Yes, master.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.048
Better make that six.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.484
This city is like living in a jungle.

25:27.584 --> 25:29.887
They drove me too far tonight.

25:29.987 --> 25:33.290
Don't worry, master.
I'm sure you'll meet her someday.

25:33.390 --> 25:34.525
It's not that.

25:34.625 --> 25:38.695
It's the $8 I had to pay for this lousy dog
license to get out of there.

25:38.795 --> 25:41.459
I'm going out to get a bite to drink.

25:43.233 --> 25:47.900
If you are hungry, master...
we could ring for the night maid.

26:00.218 --> 26:02.176
The roof, please.

26:36.722 --> 26:39.147
Morty, I love you.

26:42.328 --> 26:44.330
- Morty.
- Yeah, honey.

26:44.430 --> 26:48.467
Honey, how many times do I have
to tell you, if you want to do it...

26:48.567 --> 26:51.230
off with the cufflinks.

26:52.237 --> 26:53.739
Cufflinks?

26:53.839 --> 26:55.608
I'm not wearing any cufflinks.

26:55.708 --> 26:58.543
Well, then what's scratching my neck?

27:09.689 --> 27:11.491
Morty, what is it?

27:11.591 --> 27:15.483
It's my first wife.
I told you the check's in the mail.

27:15.762 --> 27:18.892
You freaking skinny-legged yenta.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.668
That's it.

27:21.768 --> 27:23.931
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

27:25.438 --> 27:29.274
Why don't you go to work, old man?
We have nothing to eat.

27:31.212 --> 27:34.672
We do now. Look, a chicken!
A black chicken.

27:38.285 --> 27:39.743
Boil the water.

27:44.458 --> 27:46.327
Come back, black chicken!

27:46.427 --> 27:48.795
Give us an egg or something.

28:00.841 --> 28:02.710
Yesterday, dinosaurs...

28:02.810 --> 28:06.648
and then elephants, and now, bats.
Well, why not?

28:06.748 --> 28:08.581
Hi there, little fellow.

28:35.444 --> 28:37.574
Are you all right, master?

28:37.814 --> 28:39.806
No, I'm not all right.

28:41.017 --> 28:43.612
What was that maniac drinking?

28:44.887 --> 28:47.949
Tastes like the Volga river at low tide.

28:49.058 --> 28:52.825
Let me help you out, master.
You'll be all right in a moment.

28:53.029 --> 28:55.897
No, Renfield, I'm finished. I'm through.

28:56.666 --> 29:00.194
I couldn't even scare
a field mouse at 20 meters.

29:00.470 --> 29:02.269
In a city where...

29:02.438 --> 29:06.275
taxicab drivers live in little cages,
who's afraid of a bat anymore?

29:06.375 --> 29:08.211
Here, let me help you.

29:08.311 --> 29:11.648
I'm not even a bat. I'm a black chicken.

29:11.748 --> 29:14.048
I'm a yenta with skinny legs.

29:14.918 --> 29:17.752
Take your hands off me,
you myopic dwarf.

29:19.556 --> 29:21.625
Renfield, I am finished.

29:21.725 --> 29:24.561
Over, I'm a has-been. O-V-E-R.

29:24.661 --> 29:26.797
But master, you are Dracula,
son of Dracul.

29:26.897 --> 29:29.133
You've been the reigning
Prince of Darkness...

29:29.233 --> 29:32.102
for over 700 glorious years.

29:32.202 --> 29:35.093
700 lonely years, Renfield.

29:36.640 --> 29:39.771
Lonely, master? Lonely?

29:40.310 --> 29:42.813
But I thought you were happy living...

29:42.913 --> 29:44.749
I mean, dying...

29:44.849 --> 29:47.052
I mean, existing all those years.

29:47.152 --> 29:49.821
I thought you were having fun.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.156
Fun?

29:51.256 --> 29:52.824
How would you like to go around...

29:52.924 --> 29:56.416
dressed like a headwaiter
for the last 700 years.

29:57.262 --> 29:58.863
Just once, I'd like to go to dinner...

29:58.963 --> 30:02.296
dressed in a turtleneck
and a sports jacket.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.224
Happy?

30:05.603 --> 30:09.541
How would you like to dine on nothing
but a warm liquid protein diet...

30:09.641 --> 30:11.910
while all around you,
people are eating...

30:12.010 --> 30:13.678
lamb chops...

30:13.778 --> 30:15.873
potato chips...

30:15.980 --> 30:17.850
Mallomars.

30:17.950 --> 30:22.218
Chivas Regal on the rocks with a twist.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.722
How would you like
to not have Christmas presents.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.191
Easter egg hunts.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.553
Garlic toast.

30:32.798 --> 30:33.966
No, Renfield...

30:34.066 --> 30:36.769
help me back in the coffin.
I'm not going out tonight...

30:36.869 --> 30:39.004
- or any other night.
- Yes, you are.

30:39.104 --> 30:41.107
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.875
Oh, yes, I am what, you idiot?

30:42.975 --> 30:45.070
Going out tonight, master.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.485
What is that? Another little bug?

30:51.585 --> 30:53.620
This is where she is tonight.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.816
This is where she is every night.

30:58.191 --> 31:02.357
You got this from the head
of the modeling agency, didn't you?

31:03.330 --> 31:08.360
I got this from her secretary, when
I showed up at noon with my lunch pail.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.505
Another snake, Renfield?

31:11.605 --> 31:12.806
No, master.

31:12.906 --> 31:14.341
A scorpion, perhaps?

31:14.441 --> 31:16.376
No, better, master.

31:16.476 --> 31:19.479
What could be better
than a scorpion, Renfield?

31:19.579 --> 31:21.615
Six black widow spiders...

31:21.715 --> 31:25.019
twelve fat earthworms...
two hairy caterpillars...

31:25.119 --> 31:29.787
on rye bread with a slice of onion.
A triple-decker!

31:32.159 --> 31:35.084
Was it something I said, master?

31:40.067 --> 31:41.435
Are you a member?

31:41.535 --> 31:43.766
I'm looking for somebody.

31:44.005 --> 31:45.667
Aren't we all?

33:06.523 --> 33:09.460
I'm telling you, Lisa,
he did a complete dump on her.

33:09.560 --> 33:10.794
Good evening.

33:10.894 --> 33:13.864
- Permit me to...
- No, thank you. I already ordered.

33:13.964 --> 33:16.400
She put him through four years
of medical school...

33:16.500 --> 33:18.836
two years of residency,
and a year of internship...

33:18.936 --> 33:20.771
and now he won't even take her calls.

33:20.871 --> 33:23.240
I tell you, my way's better.
You meet him, dig him...

33:23.340 --> 33:26.240
you ball him once
and then <i>adios, muchacho.</i>

33:27.878 --> 33:29.267
Lisa?

33:33.250 --> 33:35.550
I am not a waiter.

33:36.019 --> 33:37.944
I am an admirer.

33:39.257 --> 33:40.954
Permit me to...

33:41.192 --> 33:43.184
Go ahead. Have a seat.

33:47.532 --> 33:49.134
Don't tell me, let me guess.

33:49.234 --> 33:54.469
Let's see, you are either a magician
or you're into handwriting analysis, right?

33:54.906 --> 33:56.295
Neither.

33:56.841 --> 33:59.344
I've adored you from afar,
Cindy Sondheim.

33:59.444 --> 34:01.479
How did you know my name?

34:01.579 --> 34:05.210
How does one know
the wind's name is Mariah?

34:05.750 --> 34:07.981
You're weird. You know that?

34:08.686 --> 34:12.022
Look into my eyes
and tell me what you see.

34:13.225 --> 34:16.889
They're bloodshot and you had
too much to drink last night.

34:17.062 --> 34:20.556
- What else?
- I don't know.

34:20.900 --> 34:22.501
You tell me.

34:22.601 --> 34:24.228
Love.

34:25.838 --> 34:27.398
I love you.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.543
And I can give you eternal life.

34:30.643 --> 34:34.513
Shit. I knew it, an insurance salesman.
I've already got Prudential.

34:34.612 --> 34:37.650
I am Count Vladimir Dracula.
I do not sell life insurance.

34:37.750 --> 34:40.252
Don't get so hostile.
I mean, you walk over here...

34:40.351 --> 34:42.688
and you start to tell me you love me?
How could you?

34:42.788 --> 34:45.359
You don't even know me.
Maybe the only thing you know...

34:45.458 --> 34:47.928
is I don't want to get married,
or something like that.

34:48.027 --> 34:50.418
I know many things about you.

34:51.264 --> 34:53.324
Secret things.

34:54.201 --> 34:55.726
Really?

34:57.571 --> 34:59.272
Like what?

34:59.372 --> 35:00.761
Like...

35:02.008 --> 35:04.933
you enjoy having your ankles licked.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.037
Listen...

35:10.784 --> 35:13.277
maybe we can go back to my place.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.381
Or your place? Whichever.

35:16.924 --> 35:19.189
I can't believe I said that.

37:15.813 --> 37:17.737
Come on in.

37:20.951 --> 37:22.978
Can I get you anything?

37:23.120 --> 37:25.010
A broom, perhaps.

37:25.656 --> 37:27.525
I hate housework. It killed my mother.

37:27.625 --> 37:30.050
I'll see you in a minute.
I'll be right back.

37:30.629 --> 37:32.860
Make yourself comfortable.

38:10.202 --> 38:12.297
Room 903, please.

38:15.274 --> 38:18.302
What time does the sun rise
in the morning?

38:18.444 --> 38:19.833
6:48?

38:20.646 --> 38:23.649
I want you to call me at 6:00.

38:23.749 --> 38:25.639
A wake-up call.

38:31.357 --> 38:34.487
<i>Something sexy</i>

38:44.705 --> 38:46.367
<i>Et voilà.</i>

38:47.074 --> 38:49.908
What do you think of the real me?

38:55.682 --> 38:56.717
I'll be right out there.

38:56.817 --> 38:58.652
I've got the thing
to put us in the mood.

38:58.752 --> 39:01.279
Hold on. Don't go anywhere.

39:02.756 --> 39:05.025
So that's where you've been
for the last two days.

39:05.125 --> 39:08.187
And I thought you were lost,
you little devil.

39:08.428 --> 39:10.056
There you go.

39:58.580 --> 39:59.969
Hi.

40:01.817 --> 40:07.154
I got us some champagne and a little
Maui Waui. Really heavy shit.

40:07.589 --> 40:10.753
I do not drink wine...

40:11.193 --> 40:13.720
and I do not smoke shit.

40:17.967 --> 40:19.766
So much for that.

40:20.370 --> 40:21.759
How sweet.

40:22.472 --> 40:24.040
I've got just the thing for you.

40:24.140 --> 40:27.143
We'll get you a half a lude,
a Perrier water, a twist of lime...

40:27.243 --> 40:29.804
and a Perc chaser. Perfect.
I'll be right back.

40:34.450 --> 40:37.842
There's just one thing
I want to tell you before we do it.

40:49.566 --> 40:51.730
This is purely physical.

40:51.969 --> 40:54.338
I don't expect to see you
after tonight...

40:54.438 --> 40:57.830
and you are not obliged to call me,
there is no commitment.

40:57.975 --> 40:59.810
- Are you listening to me?
- No.

40:59.910 --> 41:00.945
Why not?

41:01.045 --> 41:03.514
Because you're not saying anything
we want to hear.

41:03.614 --> 41:05.538
I don't know what you mean.

41:05.916 --> 41:08.784
- I'm just trying to be honest.
- Don't be honest.

41:09.253 --> 41:10.813
What should I be?

41:11.522 --> 41:13.014
Beautiful.

41:14.225 --> 41:16.058
Be romantic.

41:17.428 --> 41:18.429
Be mine.

41:18.529 --> 41:21.465
There's just one more thing,
I'm not on the pill.

41:21.565 --> 41:24.569
They were giving me migraines.
But I'm all right. I mean...

41:24.669 --> 41:28.740
I'll be all right from the 14th to the 19th,
and today's the 16th, right?

41:28.840 --> 41:32.732
Is it the 16th?
I'm not sure if it's the 16th.

41:33.178 --> 41:35.273
What are you doing?

41:35.680 --> 41:38.344
That's so kinky! Are you biting me?

41:52.797 --> 41:54.599
I don't know, Jeffery.

41:54.699 --> 41:57.295
It just wasn't like what we have.

41:57.603 --> 42:01.674
You mean, dinner, the movies,
occasional sex to relieve anxieties.

42:01.774 --> 42:04.108
- More than that?
- More, it was...

42:04.577 --> 42:05.845
It was wild...

42:05.945 --> 42:07.607
it was crazed.

42:09.782 --> 42:13.252
It was the most unbelievable
sexual fulfillment...

42:13.352 --> 42:15.583
I've ever experienced.

42:16.622 --> 42:19.992
Why don't you come to the office
next Monday for a shot of penicillin?

42:20.092 --> 42:23.162
Don't be snide, Jeffery.
I want to get to the bottom of this.

42:23.262 --> 42:24.864
All right, let's analyze this.

42:24.964 --> 42:27.533
- That's what I'm here for.
- That's right.

42:27.633 --> 42:29.022
Let's see...

42:29.302 --> 42:32.472
the first time this happened,
you blamed it on low blood sugar.

42:32.572 --> 42:35.236
The glucose tolerance test...

42:36.243 --> 42:39.546
which I paid for, proved negative.

42:39.646 --> 42:42.916
The time before that, you said
you were having a double-crisis day...

42:43.016 --> 42:45.419
- according to your biorhythm chart.
- I was.

42:45.519 --> 42:48.021
You were? No...

42:48.121 --> 42:51.425
last night you were on a
definite optimistic upswing.

42:51.525 --> 42:53.861
- That's true.
- So much for that bullshit.

42:53.961 --> 42:56.463
Doctor, I think
you're losing your objectivity.

42:56.563 --> 42:57.531
- Really?
- Yes.

42:57.631 --> 42:59.633
Moving right along,
the time before that...

42:59.733 --> 43:02.436
you claimed the CIA had planted
a mind-bending drug...

43:02.536 --> 43:06.040
in your feminine hygiene spray.
But we checked it out...

43:06.140 --> 43:07.973
they never heard of you.

43:08.343 --> 43:10.870
So what's left?

43:11.145 --> 43:15.850
What is it that causes you to behave
with such rampant promiscuity...

43:15.950 --> 43:19.410
little Miss Hot Pants?

43:22.457 --> 43:25.660
- It couldn't be that?
- What, Jeffery?

43:25.760 --> 43:28.296
Spit it out. Just say it.

43:28.396 --> 43:31.032
Well, either you're angry with me...

43:31.132 --> 43:35.570
because of my ambivalence about
committing to a definitive relationship...

43:35.670 --> 43:36.772
after nine years.

43:36.872 --> 43:42.107
Or, this is probably the case here...

43:42.444 --> 43:44.413
it's a fantasy.

43:44.513 --> 43:45.881
- A fantasy?
- Yeah.

43:45.981 --> 43:47.905
You call this a fantasy?

43:48.517 --> 43:51.579
Did you ever see a dynamite hickey
like that before?

43:54.089 --> 43:55.478
Well?

43:59.028 --> 44:02.556
- Oh, my God!
- What?

44:03.499 --> 44:05.501
- No!
- What?

44:05.601 --> 44:08.203
- No, it can't be.
- It can't be what?

44:08.303 --> 44:12.075
- Dracula!
- How did you know his name?

44:12.175 --> 44:13.843
Dracula, alive.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.980
Of course he's alive. I told you,
I was just with him last night.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.948
- Cindy, darling...
- What?

44:20.417 --> 44:22.419
You met him a long time ago.

44:22.519 --> 44:25.945
You were a little girl.
He was a very great man.

44:26.089 --> 44:30.983
- Count Dracula?
- No, my grandfather, Dr. Fritz Van Helsing.

44:31.461 --> 44:36.389
He was the first man
to discover the thing...

44:36.766 --> 44:40.158
- you slept with last night.
- Thing? Excuse me.

44:40.937 --> 44:44.569
Last night, tell me,
how many times did he do it?

44:45.943 --> 44:48.746
Two and...

44:48.846 --> 44:51.449
a half. I fell asleep.

44:51.549 --> 44:55.112
No, I mean,
how many times did he bite you?

44:59.256 --> 45:00.645
Just once.

45:00.958 --> 45:03.260
I told you, it was our first date.

45:03.360 --> 45:06.731
I was just sitting there, at the disco,
talking to Lisa on the phone...

45:06.831 --> 45:08.220
Quiet.

45:10.534 --> 45:14.105
It was your first date
and your last date.

45:14.205 --> 45:17.336
Don't be ridiculous.
You're a jealous toad, Jeffery.

45:18.810 --> 45:21.940
Page 58, yes, here it is.

45:22.414 --> 45:26.750
"Three bites from the vampire,
and the victim is doomed."

45:29.688 --> 45:33.859
Darling, if that monster
bites you two more times...

45:33.959 --> 45:37.195
you will become a vampire,
a living corpse.

45:37.295 --> 45:40.766
Look, if last night was any indication
of what it's like to be a corpse...

45:40.866 --> 45:43.257
it sure beats the hell out of living.

45:43.468 --> 45:45.971
- Cindy, I'm serious.
- Jeff, you're crazy.

45:46.071 --> 45:49.841
Vampires in New York City,
in the 20th century? Really!

45:49.941 --> 45:52.572
Sweetheart, darling...

45:53.346 --> 45:54.735
trust me.

45:55.181 --> 45:58.982
Your life is in danger.
I almost love you.

45:59.585 --> 46:03.284
Can I just see him?
Meet him, with you, I mean?

46:03.389 --> 46:05.313
I don't know.

46:07.660 --> 46:11.030
He's meeting me for drinks at 8:00
and then he's taking me for dinner.

46:11.130 --> 46:13.794
- Don't you screw it up.
- No. Thank you.

46:16.335 --> 46:20.967
- That's time.
- Really? Already? Gee, time goes so fast.

46:23.644 --> 46:25.375
Where's my lighter?

46:26.680 --> 46:28.782
- Sweetheart.
- Yes?

46:28.882 --> 46:30.684
There's one other thing.

46:30.784 --> 46:33.982
You haven't paid
for any of these sessions...

46:34.087 --> 46:35.852
in over a year.

46:36.690 --> 46:39.960
It's not for me.
The accountants are all over me...

46:40.060 --> 46:42.792
and so I would like a little, you know.

46:43.230 --> 46:47.760
Oh, God, I forgot my checkbook.
It's on the sink, I remember.

46:50.637 --> 46:53.807
Jeffery, do you think it'd be all right
if I paid you Tuesday?

46:53.907 --> 46:55.676
I'll remember my checkbook on Tuesday.

46:55.776 --> 46:57.906
Sure, darling...

46:58.112 --> 47:00.014
because you know what Freud said:

47:00.114 --> 47:02.851
"If you don't pay for it,
you don't get better."

47:02.951 --> 47:04.953
I remember.

47:05.053 --> 47:08.889
- Thank you, Jeffery. Bye.
- Bye. Later, pumpkin.

47:12.794 --> 47:17.790
Dracula! Alive! In New York!

47:19.100 --> 47:21.161
I won't let him get her.

47:21.569 --> 47:22.958
I won't.

47:41.023 --> 47:43.592
Why don't you go and get yourself
something to eat...

47:43.692 --> 47:45.491
and be back in an hour.

48:01.010 --> 48:03.105
Uncola for me, please.

48:03.279 --> 48:05.448
- Well, where is he?
- He'll be here.

48:05.548 --> 48:07.745
Another fly-by-night character.

48:09.452 --> 48:11.683
Good evening, my beauty.

48:14.257 --> 48:15.646
Roses.

48:16.559 --> 48:18.995
They're beautiful.

48:19.095 --> 48:22.293
- Aren't they beautiful, Jeffery?
- Flowers.

48:22.866 --> 48:25.029
Don't touch the thorns.

48:25.568 --> 48:29.639
Vladimir, I'd like to introduce you
to my psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffery Rosenberg.

48:29.739 --> 48:31.575
Jeffery, Count Dracula.

48:31.675 --> 48:34.509
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Rosenberg.

48:34.744 --> 48:38.449
- Likewise, Count.
- Please call me Vladimir.

48:38.549 --> 48:40.849
And I will call you Shrink.

48:41.118 --> 48:42.815
We are in America.

48:44.088 --> 48:45.923
Did you have a nice day, my beauty?

48:46.023 --> 48:48.626
René ran my ass off all day.

48:48.726 --> 48:52.196
He may be the best photographer
in New York City, but he's still a bitch.

48:52.296 --> 48:54.832
- They've a right to their life.
- Yes, I know, Jeffery.

48:54.932 --> 48:58.236
They love in their way, we love in ours,
who's to say which is right?

48:58.336 --> 49:01.872
By the 21st century, homosexuality
will probably be the normal lifestyle.

49:01.972 --> 49:03.839
Excellent. Cigarette?

49:07.611 --> 49:10.070
I do not smoke! Thank you very much.

49:11.183 --> 49:13.380
The mirror is broken.

49:13.719 --> 49:16.246
A small accident. Forgive me, Doctor.

49:16.621 --> 49:19.391
I almost forgot,
I bought you something, too, darling.

49:19.491 --> 49:22.728
Really? For me? How sweet. What is it?

49:22.828 --> 49:26.391
- It's a good-luck necklace.
- Thank you.

49:28.433 --> 49:30.198
It's very interesting.

49:30.702 --> 49:34.339
- Oh, God, it smells awful.
- Yes. It's made of garlic.

49:34.439 --> 49:37.330
Garlic? I don't think
that's funny, Jeffery.

49:40.679 --> 49:43.048
You're getting to be a bore, Rosenberg.

49:43.148 --> 49:46.853
Von Helsing, Count Dracula.
My grandfather was Dr. Fritz Van Helsing.

49:46.953 --> 49:49.489
I changed my name to Rosenberg
for professional reasons.

49:49.589 --> 49:52.191
He practiced in London.
Is the name familiar to you?

49:52.291 --> 49:55.228
Van Helsing! I should have known.

49:55.328 --> 49:58.431
Your grandfather was a very wise man.

49:58.531 --> 50:01.901
But unfortunately for him, I was wiser.

50:02.001 --> 50:06.205
- Yes, but the race goes on.
- What the hell are you men talking about?

50:06.305 --> 50:09.275
Are you stoned, Jeffery?
Did you sneak a joint out of my purse?

50:09.375 --> 50:11.978
Let him continue, he is most amusing.

50:12.078 --> 50:14.547
You won't find this amusing, Count.

50:14.647 --> 50:19.453
- What have you there, some wolfsbane?
- Something more powerful than wolfsbane.

50:19.553 --> 50:22.615
Well, Count, what do you say to that?

50:25.793 --> 50:30.687
I would say, leave Cindy alone, and find
yourself a nice Jewish girl, Doctor.

50:31.365 --> 50:36.429
- Shit! It's the other one, isn't it?
- Good evening, Dr. Rosenberg.

50:36.970 --> 50:40.474
- Better luck next time.
- One last thing.

50:40.574 --> 50:42.810
I have no more time for games,
Dr. Rosenberg.

50:42.910 --> 50:47.337
Look into my eyes,
Count Vladimir Dracula.

50:47.481 --> 50:50.976
Look deeply into my eyes.

50:51.419 --> 50:54.055
You are getting sleepy.

50:54.155 --> 50:56.858
Knock it off, Jeffery. I'm starving.

50:56.958 --> 51:00.495
I'm going to have you find the truth
out about this man one way or another.

51:00.595 --> 51:04.999
Sleepier and sleepier.

51:05.099 --> 51:08.069
Do not teach your grandmother
how to suck eggs, Rosenberg.

51:08.169 --> 51:12.374
It is you who is getting sleepier
and sleepier.

51:12.474 --> 51:17.436
You are falling into a deep sleep.

51:18.480 --> 51:22.816
Pleasant, warm.

51:23.552 --> 51:25.283
Close your eyes.

51:26.255 --> 51:29.123
Soon you will be under my power.

51:29.458 --> 51:33.262
Look it, I can't stand much more
of this competitive macho shit...

51:33.362 --> 51:34.397
you guys, I'm warning you.

51:34.497 --> 51:39.568
Sleepier and sleepier, Count.

51:39.668 --> 51:44.164
Drowsier and drowsier, Rosenberg.

51:45.040 --> 51:48.511
You're almost asleep by now.

51:48.611 --> 51:51.881
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

51:51.981 --> 51:54.406
- You are.
- No, you are.

51:55.584 --> 51:58.510
I'm going home.

52:01.992 --> 52:03.760
Sleep.

52:03.860 --> 52:06.228
- Are you gentlemen...
- Sleep!

52:07.130 --> 52:08.622
Sleep.

52:23.013 --> 52:24.314
Who's there?

52:24.414 --> 52:26.516
Cindy!

52:26.616 --> 52:27.784
Oh, it's you.

52:27.884 --> 52:29.886
Why don't you just go back
to the Plaza...

52:29.986 --> 52:32.590
and play your little
boy games with Jeffery.

52:32.690 --> 52:34.182
Open the door.

52:34.358 --> 52:38.558
I can't. I have company.
I don't want to be disturbed.

52:45.970 --> 52:50.170
Very cute. I told you,
I've got a man in here.

52:53.277 --> 52:54.946
Now you do.

52:55.046 --> 52:57.548
Why, you arrogant S.O.B.

52:57.648 --> 53:01.142
I'm Dracula, a great power...

53:01.552 --> 53:04.148
and yet I'm humbled before you.

53:05.724 --> 53:09.795
You're the only woman I've ever loved.
You belong to me.

53:09.895 --> 53:13.499
Look it, I'm not your slave.
Now, I've asked you nicely to leave.

53:13.599 --> 53:15.762
Now I'm going to call the police.

53:17.369 --> 53:18.758
I mean it.

53:23.675 --> 53:26.009
You sought experience...

53:26.178 --> 53:28.068
and none has satisfied you.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.817
You long for something wild
and overpowering...

53:31.917 --> 53:34.182
to sweep you beyond thought.

53:43.830 --> 53:47.996
- I heard a rooster crow.
- A rooster? In New York City?

53:52.438 --> 53:56.175
- It is late. I must go.
- Wait a minute. Come on.

53:56.275 --> 53:59.769
We could go to bed,
maybe get in a little quickie?

54:02.281 --> 54:07.050
No. With you, never a quickie.

54:07.553 --> 54:10.115
Always, a longie.

54:11.592 --> 54:12.893
Until tonight.

54:12.993 --> 54:16.726
Hey, when you come back tonight,
it's okay to use the front door.

55:28.671 --> 55:31.107
I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

55:31.207 --> 55:34.599
You gotta get it right, man.
Take it easy!

55:37.713 --> 55:39.512
Who's in charge here?

55:42.218 --> 55:43.915
Thank you.

55:47.623 --> 55:52.429
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, please let me go.
I swear I'll never do it again.

55:52.529 --> 55:54.624
It was just one hubcap.

55:55.532 --> 55:59.299
Yeah, sure. What about the other three?

55:59.703 --> 56:02.765
Now, you tell me the names
of the boys in the gang...

56:02.939 --> 56:05.500
and maybe I'll give you a break.

56:05.609 --> 56:09.713
I don't know their names.
I just met them walking down the street.

56:09.813 --> 56:12.147
And you know we all look alike.

56:13.583 --> 56:18.010
Smart ass. Russell, I'm gonna throw
the book at you.

56:20.824 --> 56:24.319
- Just a minute, Lieutenant.
- Who the hell are you?

56:25.563 --> 56:28.363
I just happen to be
a doctor of psychiatry.

56:32.570 --> 56:35.097
I think this boy's telling the truth.

56:35.873 --> 56:38.409
I think he knows what he's done
and he's sorry.

56:38.509 --> 56:40.376
Well, let me tell you...

56:40.745 --> 56:43.581
today, Corvette hubcaps and tomorrow...

56:43.681 --> 56:46.606
Chase Manhattan Bank goes up in smoke,
that's right.

56:47.752 --> 56:49.449
Russell...

56:50.221 --> 56:52.612
I want you to take this.

56:52.824 --> 56:55.426
Go to this clinic
next Tuesday at 9:00...

56:55.526 --> 56:59.556
ask for Dr. Shapiro,
and you tell him that I sent you.

57:00.232 --> 57:04.159
- Is that agreed?
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

57:07.873 --> 57:11.538
Lieutenant, unlock the handcuffs.

57:13.512 --> 57:15.038
Are you sure?

57:15.247 --> 57:18.275
There are no guarantees, Lieutenant,
only chances.

57:18.984 --> 57:22.148
Okay, you must know, you're the doc.

57:22.888 --> 57:25.779
Russell, if you make a monkey
out of me...

57:26.091 --> 57:28.152
I want you to get out of here.

57:28.260 --> 57:30.697
Don't want you to ever
come back here again...

57:30.797 --> 57:32.899
unless you're selling
Girl Scout cookies, okay?

57:32.999 --> 57:37.337
Girl Scout cookies, Boy Scout cookies,
oatmeal cookies, sugar cookies...

57:37.437 --> 57:40.440
anything you want. I know
where the guy parks his truck at night.

57:40.540 --> 57:43.568
And I'll... At a discount.
No, for free, both of you.

57:48.548 --> 57:49.816
Do you feel better?

57:49.916 --> 57:53.520
Yes, I do. It's crazy, I know,
but I really do.

57:53.620 --> 57:55.009
So do I.

57:56.823 --> 58:00.860
- I almost forgot why I came in here.
- Oh, yeah? What's up, doc?

58:00.960 --> 58:03.697
A little joke I...
It just feels so good.

58:03.797 --> 58:06.767
Lieutenant,
my name is Dr. Jeffery Rosenberg...

58:06.867 --> 58:10.337
and I want to talk to you about a man
who sucks the blood out of people.

58:10.437 --> 58:12.805
Loan shark? What's his name?

58:13.274 --> 58:17.978
No, this is no loan shark.
This is a vampire.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.313
Vampire?

58:19.413 --> 58:20.548
A vampire.

58:20.648 --> 58:23.744
His name is Dracula, Count Dracula.

58:24.618 --> 58:29.955
And he bites people in the neck
and he drinks their blood.

58:33.960 --> 58:35.349
O'Brien.

58:37.031 --> 58:39.533
Get that rotten kid back in here.
Quickly.

58:39.633 --> 58:42.126
Somebody. Murphy.

58:42.570 --> 58:45.473
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

58:45.573 --> 58:48.676
Get this crazy psycho out of here
before I kill him. Get him out!

58:48.776 --> 58:50.144
Wait.

58:50.244 --> 58:53.781
It's very hard to believe this, I know.
It's a difficult thing to believe.

58:53.881 --> 58:54.882
Out!

58:54.982 --> 58:56.617
They wouldn't believe my grandfather.

58:56.717 --> 58:58.516
Get him out!

59:04.658 --> 59:07.891
- Can I help you with it, sir?
- No, that's fine.

59:08.162 --> 59:09.620
Thank you.

59:10.399 --> 59:11.788
Thank you.

59:15.303 --> 59:18.073
I'm sure you'll find everything
to your satisfaction, sir.

59:18.173 --> 59:19.608
I'm sure I will.

59:19.708 --> 59:22.110
If there's anything you need,
my name is Billy.

59:22.210 --> 59:23.879
Hello, Billy.

59:23.979 --> 59:26.949
I got everything I need right here
in this little old bag.

59:27.049 --> 59:28.917
If you catch my meaning, Billy.

59:29.017 --> 59:30.884
You need ice?

59:32.287 --> 59:33.881
No ice.

59:33.989 --> 59:37.392
You won't be disturbed, sir.
You have a nice weekend.

59:37.492 --> 59:39.361
A nice long weekend.

59:39.461 --> 59:42.193
- You, too, Billy.
- Thank you, sir.

59:42.597 --> 59:44.329
Thank you.

01:00:01.417 --> 01:00:03.386
Every now and then...

01:00:03.486 --> 01:00:05.054
it certainly helps...

01:00:05.154 --> 01:00:08.182
to have a patient doing five to 10...

01:00:08.624 --> 01:00:10.548
for breaking...

01:00:10.693 --> 01:00:12.492
and entering.

01:00:29.213 --> 01:00:31.103
Can I really do this?

01:00:31.348 --> 01:00:33.584
A Freudian wouldn't do this.

01:00:33.684 --> 01:00:37.144
A Jungian would do this.
A Reichian would do this.

01:00:37.321 --> 01:00:39.450
But I'm a Freudian.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.253
But I'm also a Van Helsing.

01:00:51.436 --> 01:00:55.363
In the name of all the Van Helsings
who have ever lived.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.000
Burn, baby, burn.

01:01:03.581 --> 01:01:05.505
Who's smoking?

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:14.192
This is a perfect example...

01:01:14.292 --> 01:01:17.422
of a man taking charge of his own life.

01:01:17.962 --> 01:01:19.731
And I feel...

01:01:19.831 --> 01:01:21.255
pretty good.

01:01:29.742 --> 01:01:31.666
Fire. Room 903.

01:01:33.512 --> 01:01:35.539
Master.

01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:43.889
Let it burn!

01:01:43.989 --> 01:01:46.559
We got to run, guy. Come on.

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:49.926
Let it burn! Let it burn!

01:01:50.062 --> 01:01:52.898
Let me go! I'm a doctor.

01:01:52.998 --> 01:01:55.263
I know what I'm doing.

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.109
See, he's a vampire.

01:02:02.209 --> 01:02:04.744
And he's got to be destroyed. He's filth.

01:02:04.844 --> 01:02:06.546
Decadence. He's unclean.

01:02:06.646 --> 01:02:08.081
He's got to be destroyed.

01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:09.683
And you know what I think?

01:02:09.783 --> 01:02:12.385
I'm not sure about this,
but I suspect...

01:02:12.485 --> 01:02:15.989
that he's better in bed
with my girl than I am!

01:02:16.089 --> 01:02:17.624
This guy has really flipped.

01:02:17.724 --> 01:02:19.591
Who's that for?

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.423
It's not for me. Get the air bubble out.

01:02:30.304 --> 01:02:31.772
<i>Dr. Donahue.</i>

01:02:31.872 --> 01:02:34.001
<i>Call 276.</i>

01:02:47.455 --> 01:02:48.990
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:51.726
Been keeping busy?
Let me see. What are you're doing?

01:02:51.826 --> 01:02:55.161
It's nothing. I'll show it to you
when it's finished.

01:02:55.363 --> 01:02:56.855
Okay.

01:02:57.265 --> 01:03:00.634
I picked up something for you to eat.

01:03:01.469 --> 01:03:04.566
- Am I going to be in here that long?
- No.

01:03:05.707 --> 01:03:10.669
I thought I ought to get a couple extra,
so the others wouldn't get upset.

01:03:11.813 --> 01:03:14.704
They are upset.
That's why they're in here.

01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:17.484
That's right.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.322
Listen, it's cool. Everything is cool.

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:25.259
I talked to your answering service
and told them the doctor is on vacation.

01:03:25.961 --> 01:03:27.062
Marry me.

01:03:27.162 --> 01:03:28.163
Jeff, please.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.098
I've been thinking.
We should get married.

01:03:30.198 --> 01:03:32.034
You always said
I don't wanna get married.

01:03:32.134 --> 01:03:35.337
You do. I was gonna tell you Tuesday,
when you came into the office.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:38.107
I'm getting the house, Largemont,
22 minutes from midtown.

01:03:38.207 --> 01:03:40.810
Good schools. No tennis court,
but there's room for one.

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:42.545
We'll love it there.

01:03:42.645 --> 01:03:43.746
Jeffery, please.

01:03:43.846 --> 01:03:46.082
A dog, you've always wanted one.
I found one.

01:03:46.182 --> 01:03:49.953
She's not spayed. I wanted to talk
about it first. Though I'm not Catholic...

01:03:50.053 --> 01:03:52.555
Jeffery, you're getting hysterical!

01:03:52.655 --> 01:03:55.649
I know, I'm sorry.

01:03:56.092 --> 01:03:58.323
Okay. Cindy...

01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:01.598
get me out of here quickly.
You know I'm not insane.

01:04:01.698 --> 01:04:03.122
All right.

01:04:03.866 --> 01:04:06.869
It's all been arranged.
But you've got to promise me to be good.

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:09.030
No more carrying on!

01:04:12.376 --> 01:04:13.711
No, I'll be good.

01:04:13.811 --> 01:04:16.480
I'll be better than good.
I'll be perfect.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.382
- No more fires?
- No.

01:04:18.482 --> 01:04:21.518
- No more possessive tantrums?
- No.

01:04:21.618 --> 01:04:22.987
No more fires.

01:04:23.087 --> 01:04:25.648
I promise. No more fires.

01:04:26.924 --> 01:04:28.552
Promise?

01:04:28.692 --> 01:04:31.095
Okay, you'll be out of here in no time.

01:04:31.195 --> 01:04:33.264
Don't worry. Go back to your drawing.

01:04:33.364 --> 01:04:36.597
<i>Visiting hours will be over</i>
<i>in 15 minutes, please.</i>

01:04:38.969 --> 01:04:43.864
<i>Attention. Visiting hours will be over</i>
<i>in 15 minutes, please.</i>

01:04:58.923 --> 01:05:00.925
You did real well, Renfield.

01:05:01.025 --> 01:05:02.193
Thank you, master.

01:05:02.293 --> 01:05:06.493
A combination getaway car
and mobile home.

01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:10.435
When we get inside,
I want you to play it real cold.

01:05:10.535 --> 01:05:12.470
I believe that's "real cool," master.

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:14.665
Cool. Yeah.

01:05:15.006 --> 01:05:16.308
We're going to make a hoist.

01:05:16.408 --> 01:05:18.572
- Heist.
- Heist.

01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:32.458
I'm sorry, we're closed.

01:05:32.558 --> 01:05:34.794
We've come to make a withdrawal.

01:05:34.894 --> 01:05:38.730
We have a very sick man in the car
who needs blood desperately.

01:05:39.799 --> 01:05:41.791
That's a hearse!

01:05:42.301 --> 01:05:44.070
So maybe we're a bit late.

01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:46.561
I told you, we're closed.

01:05:46.839 --> 01:05:48.574
The only thing closed...

01:05:48.674 --> 01:05:50.565
are your eyes.

01:05:57.617 --> 01:06:01.009
Fill out these cards and follow me.

01:06:08.428 --> 01:06:09.896
What type are you?

01:06:09.996 --> 01:06:11.498
Ruthless.

01:06:11.598 --> 01:06:14.334
We didn't come to give. We came to take.

01:06:14.434 --> 01:06:18.326
Give us all your blood
in small, unmarked bills.

01:06:18.472 --> 01:06:20.806
Master, that's "bottles."

01:06:20.974 --> 01:06:22.602
Bottles.

01:06:22.976 --> 01:06:25.179
Of course. Forgive me.

01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:27.408
We are new at this.

01:06:28.649 --> 01:06:31.119
If you two freaks
don't get out of here...

01:06:31.219 --> 01:06:34.055
I am going to scream my head off.

01:06:34.155 --> 01:06:38.150
If you scream loudly, they'll think
you are frightened by a mouse.

01:06:49.804 --> 01:06:52.764
Master, we hit the jackpot!

01:06:53.941 --> 01:06:55.501
Only in America.

01:06:56.777 --> 01:06:59.339
Plastic disposable bodies.

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:02.618
It's like a supermarket.

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:07.384
Master, it'll be wonderful at the reception
when you marry Miss Cindy.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:12.019
<i>How they danced</i>
<i>on the night that they bled</i>

01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:14.530
I propose a toast.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.930
Here's blood in your eye.

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:19.998
Close your eyes and hope to die.

01:07:23.405 --> 01:07:26.239
Are you sure your eyes are closed?

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:34.110
Open them now.

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:43.092
Vladimir, that's lovely.

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:44.194
What is that?

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:45.528
A blood...

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:47.154
ruby.

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:51.556
And what are those little birds?

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:54.865
It's nothing.
A creature of the night. It flies.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:05.481
Must have been very expensive.
How did you afford it?

01:08:06.984 --> 01:08:10.182
I put a little away
for a very long time.

01:08:14.625 --> 01:08:17.255
What's wrong? You seem so sad.

01:08:18.429 --> 01:08:20.296
I don't know.

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:25.130
I think I love you, Vladimir.

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:29.403
And part of me
still wants to be independent.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.477
Part of me wants to be taken care of.

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:36.845
And part of me would like to be
a wife and a mother.

01:08:39.584 --> 01:08:42.654
Part of me still thinks
I am just, like, an expensive whore...

01:08:42.754 --> 01:08:47.352
who'd sell anything from dog food
to mouthwash for $1,000 a day.

01:08:48.627 --> 01:08:50.220
Oh, God!

01:08:50.328 --> 01:08:52.319
I'm so confused.

01:09:00.639 --> 01:09:03.734
You were born in the wrong time,
Cindy Sondheim.

01:09:04.509 --> 01:09:07.969
In the other age,
things were simpler, less complicated.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:13.981
Do you remember how many women had
nervous breakdowns in the 14th century?

01:09:14.386 --> 01:09:16.379
- No.
- Three.

01:09:17.055 --> 01:09:19.926
Why do you treat me so well, Vladimir?

01:09:20.026 --> 01:09:25.055
Without this face that I wake up every
morning looking for the first wrinkle...

01:09:25.598 --> 01:09:26.765
I'm nothing.

01:09:26.866 --> 01:09:28.634
Do you think of me as special?

01:09:28.734 --> 01:09:30.269
Yes, of course.

01:09:30.368 --> 01:09:34.500
Then how can you think of yourself
as nothing if I love you?

01:09:35.006 --> 01:09:36.772
Besides...

01:09:38.678 --> 01:09:40.613
I can arrange it...

01:09:40.712 --> 01:09:44.515
so you never have to look
in a mirror again.

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:48.255
I can arrange it so you can.

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:50.991
The second way to kill a vampire, Count.

01:09:51.091 --> 01:09:53.327
Three silver bullets through the heart.

01:09:53.426 --> 01:09:54.953
Jeffery!

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:58.192
No, Rosenberg.

01:09:58.665 --> 01:10:00.467
That is a werewolf.

01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:03.834
A werewolf. Really? Are you sure?

01:10:04.271 --> 01:10:07.207
No harm done. The man's all right.

01:10:07.307 --> 01:10:10.644
This was for a werewolf.
No problem. Calm down. Take it easy.

01:10:10.744 --> 01:10:13.013
I'm a doctor and I know what I'm doing.

01:10:13.113 --> 01:10:15.682
He's all right.
He's even got a little color.

01:10:15.782 --> 01:10:18.777
Not to worry, my dear.
It's a small annoyance.

01:10:29.831 --> 01:10:31.425
Who are you?

01:10:33.201 --> 01:10:35.103
Do you know,
whenever I'm with you, I see...

01:10:35.203 --> 01:10:37.093
Places...

01:10:37.638 --> 01:10:39.403
in my eyes...

01:10:40.308 --> 01:10:43.108
that you've only seen in dreams.

01:10:44.011 --> 01:10:45.400
Yes.

01:10:47.081 --> 01:10:50.075
They've not been dreams.

01:10:52.888 --> 01:10:55.756
Nor do they ever have to be again.

01:11:06.401 --> 01:11:08.737
It's just incredible.

01:11:08.837 --> 01:11:11.228
I finally know what I want.

01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:14.568
What about your career?

01:11:15.144 --> 01:11:16.979
I don't know.

01:11:17.079 --> 01:11:19.748
Sometimes I think a career to a woman
is kind of like...

01:11:19.848 --> 01:11:23.308
fooling around to a man.
I mean, it's a lot of fun.

01:11:24.721 --> 01:11:27.112
Till the right person comes along.

01:11:27.991 --> 01:11:30.222
What about Rosenberg?

01:11:31.528 --> 01:11:33.156
Jeffery.

01:11:35.565 --> 01:11:38.991
He just doesn't make me feel
the way you make me feel.

01:11:49.078 --> 01:11:51.036
What are you doing?

01:11:51.581 --> 01:11:53.505
What does it feel like I'm doing?

01:11:55.952 --> 01:11:57.877
Feels so cold.

01:12:01.091 --> 01:12:04.983
Finally after 712 years...

01:12:05.496 --> 01:12:08.330
to have someone bite me again.

01:12:16.607 --> 01:12:18.142
You can see him now.

01:12:18.242 --> 01:12:21.873
<i>Physical therapist,</i>
<i>please report to Room 264.</i>

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.349
Hi, Doc.

01:12:36.695 --> 01:12:38.255
Remember me?

01:12:38.797 --> 01:12:41.700
"All of the victims had two
puncture marks on their necks.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.136
"But no one could remember
how it happened."

01:12:44.236 --> 01:12:46.763
Absolutely! Dracula.

01:12:47.072 --> 01:12:50.842
"Nothing was stolen
and no one was sexually molested.

01:12:50.942 --> 01:12:53.003
"Turn to Page 46."

01:12:53.178 --> 01:12:55.781
Thirty years in the force,
never cracked a big one.

01:12:55.881 --> 01:12:58.049
And now here's my big chance.

01:12:58.149 --> 01:13:02.521
I have to go after a vampire.
Why couldn't it have been a drug bust?

01:13:02.621 --> 01:13:05.991
Although no one has ever
gone after a vampire before.

01:13:06.459 --> 01:13:08.451
No one has ever tried.

01:13:09.128 --> 01:13:10.263
Except me.

01:13:10.363 --> 01:13:13.833
So, after four victims
and the blood bank robbery...

01:13:13.933 --> 01:13:16.733
Page 23, you finally believe me.

01:13:17.236 --> 01:13:19.536
I don't know what to believe, Doc.

01:13:20.106 --> 01:13:23.100
A lot of funny things
going down in this city.

01:13:23.676 --> 01:13:27.773
Not funny, Lieutenant!
Horrible. Messy. Unspeakable.

01:13:29.515 --> 01:13:30.483
Page 38.

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:33.886
Come on, Ferguson.
Help me turn to Page 46.

01:13:33.986 --> 01:13:36.513
I'll do more than that, Doc.

01:13:37.357 --> 01:13:40.248
I'm going to get you out of here.
Come on.

01:13:40.761 --> 01:13:42.788
Leave everything to me.

01:14:05.285 --> 01:14:07.120
Oh, my God!

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:10.959
I've lost her forever. He's drained
all the blood out of her. We're too late.

01:14:11.059 --> 01:14:13.595
Jeffery, will you calm down?
This is an herbal mask...

01:14:13.695 --> 01:14:16.256
you've seen me wear it a million times.

01:14:16.364 --> 01:14:17.398
Herbal mask?

01:14:17.498 --> 01:14:22.503
Yes. But you're right, you're too late.
We're in love. Now get out of here.

01:14:22.603 --> 01:14:26.666
You call this love? Look at this.
Two sets of bites.

01:14:27.108 --> 01:14:29.244
I don't know.
It looks awfully small to me.

01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:30.912
You're sure that's not prickly heat?

01:14:31.012 --> 01:14:34.015
We've still got time to save her.
Come on, I know he's in there.

01:14:34.115 --> 01:14:35.116
- No!
- Get out of here.

01:14:35.216 --> 01:14:37.919
We can't go in without a search warrant.
You know the law.

01:14:38.019 --> 01:14:41.222
If we don't, her immortal soul
will be lost forever.

01:14:41.322 --> 01:14:45.056
And if we do, I lose my pension.
Come on. I know a friendly judge.

01:14:50.032 --> 01:14:51.467
Oh, Jeffery.

01:14:51.567 --> 01:14:55.037
Listen, we're getting married next week.
I'm registered at Bloomingdale's.

01:14:55.137 --> 01:14:59.341
I'm okay with crystal but I'm a little short
on china and silverware.

01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:01.604
You get nothing from me!

01:15:05.647 --> 01:15:07.249
Say what?

01:15:07.349 --> 01:15:10.386
A search warrant, Your Honor.
We need a search warrant right now.

01:15:10.486 --> 01:15:13.923
There's been a rash of bat bites in the city.
Maybe you've read about it.

01:15:14.023 --> 01:15:17.961
A blood bank robbery. And this girl has
these two red holes in her neck.

01:15:18.061 --> 01:15:20.697
We have reason to believe
this is the work of a vampire.

01:15:20.797 --> 01:15:22.098
A vampire.

01:15:22.198 --> 01:15:25.035
That's right. That's why we need
the warrant right now.

01:15:25.135 --> 01:15:29.039
So we can grab him
while he's still sleeping in his coffin.

01:15:29.139 --> 01:15:31.675
I cannot believe what I'm hearing.

01:15:31.775 --> 01:15:34.244
Your Honor,
let me shed some light on this.

01:15:34.344 --> 01:15:36.211
Listen, honky.

01:15:37.013 --> 01:15:38.448
Didn't you see <i>Roots?</i>

01:15:38.548 --> 01:15:39.749
I loved <i>Roots.</i>

01:15:39.849 --> 01:15:41.851
And Brima is a terrific dancer.

01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:43.820
You better believe it.

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.523
And our people have come a long way...

01:15:46.623 --> 01:15:51.195
for you to be coming in here
with that voodoo scary Dracula shit.

01:15:51.295 --> 01:15:54.799
Now I want you to haul ass
out of my courtroom...

01:15:54.899 --> 01:15:57.068
before I really get mean.

01:15:57.168 --> 01:15:59.968
Your Honor, I'm a doctor of...

01:16:04.108 --> 01:16:05.736
Look at this.

01:16:09.313 --> 01:16:10.414
It's him.

01:16:10.514 --> 01:16:13.314
Yeah. Or a rock group. Come on.

01:16:26.531 --> 01:16:27.899
Are you coming or aren't you?

01:16:27.999 --> 01:16:29.835
I can't do it, Doc.
I told you. I'm sorry.

01:16:29.935 --> 01:16:31.536
You bring him down. I'll do the rest.

01:16:31.636 --> 01:16:33.305
All right. You stay right here.

01:16:33.405 --> 01:16:35.067
Wait a minute.

01:16:36.308 --> 01:16:39.074
- You may need this.
- He's already dead.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.849
You can't come in!

01:16:54.559 --> 01:16:56.528
I'm in. Where is he?

01:16:56.628 --> 01:16:59.665
He's not here. Now, why don't you
leave us alone, for God's sake!

01:16:59.765 --> 01:17:02.395
Where is he? Where's his damn coffin?

01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:04.437
I know he's here somewhere.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:08.134
Who does this patent leather pump
belong to? Cinderella?

01:17:08.474 --> 01:17:11.707
He's in here somewhere
and I'll find him.

01:17:11.811 --> 01:17:14.213
It's me! I don't see
any pictures of him.

01:17:14.313 --> 01:17:16.616
You know why there are
no pictures of him?

01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:19.949
Because you can't
take any pictures of him. That's why.

01:17:21.988 --> 01:17:23.685
Here somewhere.

01:17:29.662 --> 01:17:33.200
So we meet again, Dr. Rosenberg.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.568
Where's your master?

01:17:34.668 --> 01:17:38.605
He's at the airport buying tickets
for our flight home tonight.

01:17:38.705 --> 01:17:41.208
Why did you tell him that?

01:17:41.308 --> 01:17:44.778
Because the bad guys always tell
the good guys what they're going to do...

01:17:44.878 --> 01:17:46.914
just before they try to kill them.

01:17:47.014 --> 01:17:48.916
He's absolutely right, Miss Cindy.

01:17:49.016 --> 01:17:53.253
That's part of the rules, but in this case,
we are the good guys.

01:17:53.353 --> 01:17:57.324
Shall we let history make that judgment?

01:17:57.424 --> 01:18:01.061
Certainly, Rosenberg.

01:18:01.161 --> 01:18:03.030
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:04.966
Yes. Do you like centipedes?

01:18:05.066 --> 01:18:06.067
Why do you ask?

01:18:06.167 --> 01:18:08.536
There's a beautiful one
in front of your left foot.

01:18:08.636 --> 01:18:10.162
Where?

01:18:14.676 --> 01:18:18.204
And you call yourself a doctor.

01:18:21.549 --> 01:18:22.717
Jeffery!

01:18:22.817 --> 01:18:24.285
Come on. You're coming with me.

01:18:24.385 --> 01:18:26.588
No, I'm not. Look it, I love him
and he loves me.

01:18:26.688 --> 01:18:30.325
Why don't you just walk around the block
and explain that to yourself?

01:18:30.425 --> 01:18:33.817
Okay. I'm sorry.
I've been way out of line here.

01:18:34.062 --> 01:18:36.097
I'm really sorry.
You've seen the last of me.

01:18:36.197 --> 01:18:38.623
All right. Sorry to see it end this way.

01:18:38.734 --> 01:18:40.903
One way or the other, sister.

01:18:41.003 --> 01:18:42.734
Nightie-night.

01:19:00.022 --> 01:19:01.423
Please, God.

01:19:01.523 --> 01:19:03.254
Not again.

01:19:03.892 --> 01:19:07.557
Please don't mess with that big switch
up there in the sky.

01:19:21.411 --> 01:19:22.937
Jet lag.

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:32.622
What's going on here?

01:19:32.722 --> 01:19:33.823
Quiet!

01:19:33.923 --> 01:19:36.593
It's another brown out. We're stuck.
Somebody got a match?

01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:40.230
He's right. Relaxez-vous.
I got a lighter in my right-hand pocket.

01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:44.030
Would one of you guys wanna reach in,
grab it, and flick my Bic?

01:19:45.069 --> 01:19:46.561
Excuse me.

01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:47.638
I've got it.

01:19:47.738 --> 01:19:49.674
Well, the important thing
is not to panic.

01:19:49.774 --> 01:19:51.842
Too many people in here.
Somebody's got to go.

01:19:51.942 --> 01:19:55.368
What are you talking about?
This is an elevator, not a lifeboat.

01:19:58.949 --> 01:20:00.839
Maurice.

01:20:06.223 --> 01:20:08.181
Hello, honey.

01:20:08.859 --> 01:20:10.385
Hello!

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:14.198
Animals.

01:20:14.298 --> 01:20:16.393
People in a blackout become animals.

01:20:26.445 --> 01:20:27.646
Renfield, where is she?

01:20:27.746 --> 01:20:30.382
She's gone. Rosenberg took her.

01:20:30.482 --> 01:20:31.617
Rosenberg. Where?

01:20:31.717 --> 01:20:34.519
I don't know.
They only left a few moments ago.

01:20:34.619 --> 01:20:38.216
Master, what are we to do now?
Where are we to go?

01:20:38.757 --> 01:20:41.785
Airline tickets to romantic places.

01:20:41.893 --> 01:20:44.529
- London!
- Dorchester Hotel.

01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:47.497
- England.
- Just like the good old days.

01:20:47.833 --> 01:20:49.393
Where am I?

01:20:50.636 --> 01:20:52.805
- What happened?
- You tell her. Poor darling.

01:20:52.905 --> 01:20:55.842
It's all right. Cindy, relax.
Everything is gonna be all right.

01:20:55.942 --> 01:20:57.977
- Long flight.
- Now I remember.

01:20:58.077 --> 01:21:00.546
Let go of me, Dr. Rosenberg.
I'm gonna scream.

01:21:00.646 --> 01:21:04.717
No screaming. I'm becoming unglued
as it is. God, I think I'm gonna faint.

01:21:04.817 --> 01:21:07.947
If you do, it'll have to be
standing up, fruitcake.

01:21:18.598 --> 01:21:20.166
Vladimir!

01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:22.602
I'm coming to save you.

01:21:22.702 --> 01:21:24.695
We're gonna be saved!

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:27.641
You fools!

01:21:27.741 --> 01:21:30.144
How stupid can you be?
That was the voice of Dracula.

01:21:30.244 --> 01:21:32.880
- Dracula who?
- Dracula who?

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:36.016
Dracula, lady.
That blood-sucking vampire.

01:21:36.116 --> 01:21:39.186
Haven't you read the newspapers?
He's on his way down here...

01:21:39.286 --> 01:21:42.723
for this girl, and after her,
God knows who's next.

01:21:42.823 --> 01:21:44.952
Come on, let him have it.

01:21:49.897 --> 01:21:52.666
Listen, can't believe
what's going on here.

01:21:52.766 --> 01:21:54.635
Take care of your mother.
Bolt the doors.

01:21:54.735 --> 01:21:58.867
If anybody breaks in, tell him
your father is cop, that'll scare him.

01:21:59.274 --> 01:22:01.972
- What are you doing?
- It's for my den.

01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:05.113
I hate Princess phones, don't you?

01:22:05.213 --> 01:22:06.381
You can't do that.

01:22:06.481 --> 01:22:08.348
Give me that back!

01:22:08.683 --> 01:22:10.072
Lost my dime.

01:22:11.152 --> 01:22:13.888
- There.
- Do not forget, lady. You owe us.

01:22:13.988 --> 01:22:14.989
I won't.

01:22:15.089 --> 01:22:17.692
Don't forget to tell them
we're here, darling.

01:22:17.792 --> 01:22:18.993
Now remember, honey...

01:22:19.093 --> 01:22:21.262
Mrs. Knockwood in 14B.

01:22:21.362 --> 01:22:23.559
Please, turn off the pot roast.

01:22:29.337 --> 01:22:32.138
Quickly, my darling. Hold on tight.

01:22:33.542 --> 01:22:37.046
Honey, can we stop by the apartment
so I can pack a little overnight bag?

01:22:37.146 --> 01:22:40.140
Of course, my darling.
Which floor is it?

01:22:42.685 --> 01:22:44.245
We're saved!

01:22:49.525 --> 01:22:53.662
Listen, kid.
I'm sorry about that, you know.

01:22:53.762 --> 01:22:55.364
You kind of went bananas.

01:22:55.464 --> 01:22:59.201
Look, if you ever need me
anytime of the day or night...

01:22:59.301 --> 01:23:01.971
I'm right across the street
at St. Vincent's.

01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:04.708
Such a nice Jewish boy. A doctor, yet.

01:23:04.808 --> 01:23:07.511
Why you need a <i>meshugennah</i> blonde
like that for?

01:23:07.611 --> 01:23:10.809
My sister Lina, she has a daughter.

01:23:12.749 --> 01:23:13.917
Ferguson.

01:23:14.017 --> 01:23:16.586
I had her, but he took her
up the elevator shaft.

01:23:16.686 --> 01:23:19.850
All right. What goes up
must come down. Come on.

01:23:20.257 --> 01:23:23.182
You're all under arrest.
Every one of you!

01:23:29.633 --> 01:23:32.202
Get your $10 flashlight.
How about it, sir?

01:23:32.302 --> 01:23:34.204
$10 for a flashlight?

01:23:34.304 --> 01:23:37.469
- Supply and demand.
- I'm a cop, you know.

01:23:38.175 --> 01:23:41.712
$2 for a flashlight.
Get your $2 flashlights.

01:23:41.812 --> 01:23:43.907
Where the hell are they?

01:23:47.184 --> 01:23:50.488
Gentlemen, could you tell me exactly
what you did during the blackout?

01:23:50.588 --> 01:23:52.957
- Is this local or network?
- Local.

01:23:53.057 --> 01:23:55.254
- Live or tape?
- Live.

01:23:55.426 --> 01:23:58.529
There's a vampire loose in the city.

01:23:58.629 --> 01:24:03.267
Lock up your wives, your sisters,
your daughters, and your sweethearts.

01:24:03.367 --> 01:24:04.502
No!

01:24:04.602 --> 01:24:06.404
This is Edward Calvin reporting...

01:24:06.504 --> 01:24:09.065
- He's already got my girl.
- Come on.

01:24:09.574 --> 01:24:11.272
There they are.

01:24:14.413 --> 01:24:15.802
Come on.

01:24:16.982 --> 01:24:18.617
...reporting on the street coverage...

01:24:18.717 --> 01:24:20.385
Protect yourself. Looks like a bat!

01:24:20.485 --> 01:24:24.116
Lots of strange happenings,
we're gonna find out the details later.

01:24:27.059 --> 01:24:29.154
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi, Russell.

01:24:29.761 --> 01:24:31.560
See you at the clinic.

01:24:34.766 --> 01:24:36.101
I told you so.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:38.626
Maybe it's just therapy.

01:24:38.837 --> 01:24:39.938
Doc, look.

01:24:40.038 --> 01:24:41.905
A bike. Come on.

01:25:03.096 --> 01:25:05.832
They're following us. Isn't it exciting?

01:25:05.932 --> 01:25:08.968
What following? What?
Something I should know?

01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:11.137
Hang a right on Queens Boulevard.

01:25:11.237 --> 01:25:13.339
Proceed due north
on the Van Wyck Expressway.

01:25:13.439 --> 01:25:16.709
Forget the Grand Central and the Belt
Parkway. This takes us right in.

01:25:16.809 --> 01:25:20.347
That's terrific. Would you like
to come up here and help me drive?

01:25:20.447 --> 01:25:22.041
If necessary.

01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:38.930
He's heading to the expressway.

01:25:48.308 --> 01:25:50.445
I told you, we're stuck.

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.480
It could be backed up for miles.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.484
Erwin Newman, driver 10763.

01:25:56.584 --> 01:26:00.977
I command you to defy the laws
of centrifugal force.

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.424
Close your eyes.

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:04.619
Yes, master. I mean, mister.

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:15.670
Oh, this is great!

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:19.435
I won't have to get
my tires rotated this month.

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:20.775
Drive on the grass.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:23.746
That I can't do. It's illegal.

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:26.612
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to the car.

01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:41.530
He'll get himself killed doing that.

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:44.521
Told you, he's already dead.

01:26:58.448 --> 01:27:01.051
Doc, how much did you say
that girl owes you?

01:27:01.151 --> 01:27:04.821
Counting Friday, $7,452.

01:27:04.921 --> 01:27:06.723
But it's not the money.

01:27:06.823 --> 01:27:09.657
There's a good chance I love her.

01:27:15.732 --> 01:27:17.334
Watch out for that oak tree!

01:27:17.434 --> 01:27:18.735
Tell him, lady.

01:27:18.835 --> 01:27:22.204
I haven't been driving
for the past five minutes.

01:27:50.334 --> 01:27:54.338
Eat your heart out, Burt Reynolds!

01:27:54.438 --> 01:27:56.941
Vladimir, they're still kissing.

01:27:57.041 --> 01:27:59.010
Isn't that sweet?

01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:00.511
How romantic.

01:28:00.611 --> 01:28:03.448
Erwin, put on some music.

01:28:03.549 --> 01:28:05.109
All right!

01:28:15.994 --> 01:28:17.963
Use the radio. Call for help.

01:28:18.063 --> 01:28:21.100
Yeah, what am I supposed to do?
Tell them this is Lt. Ferguson...

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.068
I'm on a stolen bike
with a psychiatrist...

01:28:23.168 --> 01:28:26.004
chasing a vampire who's going to
bite this girl on her neck...

01:28:26.104 --> 01:28:27.206
so she can turn into a bat.

01:28:27.306 --> 01:28:28.574
Yeah, tell them that.

01:28:28.674 --> 01:28:31.133
There goes my pension.

01:28:37.016 --> 01:28:38.883
We're almost there.

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.654
How much do I owe you?

01:28:41.754 --> 01:28:43.623
Owe me? Forget about it.

01:28:43.723 --> 01:28:47.127
I've been driving people to the airport
for 32 years...

01:28:47.227 --> 01:28:51.620
and this is the first time I ever took
a flight. Thanks a lot, buddy.

01:28:52.532 --> 01:28:54.991
I only wish the missus was here.

01:29:02.141 --> 01:29:04.477
I don't know how it could have happened.

01:29:04.577 --> 01:29:05.912
It's dreadful.

01:29:06.012 --> 01:29:09.249
The coffin is supposed to be
on Flight 602 to London.

01:29:09.349 --> 01:29:13.254
When it arrives in Jamaica, it'll be sent
on the very next flight to London.

01:29:13.354 --> 01:29:16.323
But that will be too late.
My master will disintegrate.

01:29:16.423 --> 01:29:18.586
He'll turn to dust.

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:23.386
Master, we have a problem.
We have a terrible problem.

01:29:27.635 --> 01:29:30.938
Correction, Renfield.
Several terrible problems.

01:29:31.038 --> 01:29:32.673
Age before beauty. Follow me.

01:29:32.773 --> 01:29:36.472
Listen, when you go through customs,
be careful with that little bag.

01:29:39.947 --> 01:29:43.652
But, master, the coffin's
on its way to Jamaica.

01:29:43.752 --> 01:29:47.883
What else is new?
I'll see you in Jamaica.

01:29:50.825 --> 01:29:52.715
Quick. The runway.

01:29:53.261 --> 01:29:56.364
Jamaica. Aisle seat. No smoking.
What's the movie?

01:29:56.464 --> 01:29:58.559
<i>In Cold Blood.</i>

01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:16.779
Vladimir, stop. It's too late.

01:30:19.655 --> 01:30:21.591
There is another way.

01:30:21.691 --> 01:30:23.388
The third bite?

01:30:23.592 --> 01:30:26.128
I don't know, Vladimir.

01:30:26.228 --> 01:30:29.461
I mean, you're a beautiful lover.

01:30:29.732 --> 01:30:31.861
And you're a great dancer.

01:30:32.535 --> 01:30:35.165
You go through doors great.

01:30:36.238 --> 01:30:38.407
I don't know
how you're gonna look as a bat.

01:30:38.507 --> 01:30:39.842
I just don't know what to do.

01:30:39.942 --> 01:30:42.435
You'll have to tell me what to do.

01:30:43.612 --> 01:30:45.946
You must make the choice.

01:30:46.282 --> 01:30:47.842
No.

01:30:49.018 --> 01:30:50.579
As for me...

01:30:53.657 --> 01:30:56.287
in a world without romance...

01:30:57.361 --> 01:30:59.626
it's better to be dead.

01:31:02.132 --> 01:31:04.401
I'm pretty sure I love you.

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:08.038
What am I saying? Of course I love you.

01:31:08.138 --> 01:31:09.869
I think.

01:31:11.208 --> 01:31:13.542
Do it now, Vladimir.

01:31:24.022 --> 01:31:26.591
The third way to kill a vampire...

01:31:26.691 --> 01:31:28.319
Herr Count.

01:31:28.493 --> 01:31:32.090
A wooden stake through the heart.

01:31:35.967 --> 01:31:38.303
Stop it, Doctor. Stop it. Stop it.

01:31:38.403 --> 01:31:41.639
Stop it. No good. They're gone. See?

01:31:41.739 --> 01:31:43.341
They disappeared.

01:31:43.441 --> 01:31:45.536
- Gone.
- Oh, no.

01:31:47.445 --> 01:31:49.213
Cindy, don't go.

01:31:49.313 --> 01:31:51.476
Come back. I need you.

01:31:51.783 --> 01:31:53.673
Let's talk about it.

01:31:55.086 --> 01:31:57.512
Look. The check.

01:31:59.458 --> 01:32:02.122
She paid me everything she owes me.

01:32:03.395 --> 01:32:06.093
She left me, but she learned something.

01:32:07.399 --> 01:32:09.767
She's a responsible person.

01:32:10.436 --> 01:32:12.167
Or whatever.

01:32:16.375 --> 01:32:19.878
What was it with that guy?
I mean, what did he have?

01:32:19.978 --> 01:32:22.681
Was it the accent? "Good evening."

01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:25.308
No, I think it was the cape.

01:32:25.684 --> 01:32:27.881
- The cape?
- The cape.

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.614
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Try it out.

01:32:30.857 --> 01:32:33.452
Let's see what it looks like.

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.649
There.

01:32:37.297 --> 01:32:39.164
What do you think?

01:32:39.966 --> 01:32:42.235
Definitely, it was the cape.

01:32:42.335 --> 01:32:45.372
- It really looks terrific on you.
- You think so?

01:32:45.472 --> 01:32:46.998
I think so.

01:32:48.174 --> 01:32:49.700
Listen...

01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:53.735
Doc, I have an anniversary coming up.
My tenth.

01:32:54.514 --> 01:32:58.585
If I came home this Friday night
with a bottle of wine, a dozen roses...

01:32:58.685 --> 01:33:02.188
wearing that cape, I think it would
drive my wife up the wall.

01:33:02.288 --> 01:33:05.157
Can I borrow it
for just one night, please?

01:33:07.495 --> 01:33:08.496
All right.

01:33:08.596 --> 01:33:09.563
Thanks, Doctor.

01:33:09.663 --> 01:33:11.932
But I want it back Saturday
for the weekend.

01:33:12.032 --> 01:33:14.635
- Sure. I'll even have it cleaned. All right?
- Okay.

01:33:14.735 --> 01:33:16.124
Thanks.

01:33:27.081 --> 01:33:29.050
This isn't it so hard.

01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:31.519
I think I'm gonna love immortality.

01:33:31.619 --> 01:33:34.453
There is one small disadvantage.

01:33:35.055 --> 01:33:36.757
You can only live by night.

01:33:36.858 --> 01:33:38.326
That's all right with me.

01:33:38.426 --> 01:33:42.489
I mean, I could never really
get my shit together till 7:00, anyway.
