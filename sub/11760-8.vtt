00:31.610 --> 00:33.610
What the...?

00:55.930 --> 00:56.930
Bram?

00:56.931 --> 00:58.970
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:03.370 --> 01:07.849
You're certain that the man
was following you?

01:07.850 --> 01:09.569
Did you confront him about it?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.449
Of course not. You know me.

01:11.450 --> 01:15.529
Any heroics are confined
to my fiction.

01:15.530 --> 01:17.249
No whiskey?

01:17.250 --> 01:18.969
All I have is Scotch.

01:18.970 --> 01:21.849
And I know better than to offer
Scotch to an Irishman.

01:21.850 --> 01:23.890
I'll choke it down.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.089
You honestly believe that the
man meant to harm you?

01:32.090 --> 01:33.809
I'm certain of it.

01:33.810 --> 01:36.809
Just like the cab driver last week?
Reckless fool.

01:36.810 --> 01:40.050
And the fishmonger?
That mackerel was off.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.809
I know you've been unusually
anxious, as of late.

01:45.810 --> 01:49.089
And with good reason. Your book is
being released in paperback, when?

01:49.090 --> 01:50.355
(SIGHS) Monday, week.

01:50.357 --> 01:53.290
With that release, comes lecture
requests and dinner parties.

01:53.370 --> 01:56.289
Everyone wants to hear from the
brilliant author of Dracula.

01:56.290 --> 02:01.929
Bram Stoker, who absolutely loves
public appearances.

02:01.930 --> 02:04.689
I know that anxiety well.
No, you don't.

02:04.690 --> 02:07.169
You're completely at ease
speaking in public.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.729
A few more sips of whiskey and
you'll be at ease as well.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.785
Then I'll take you home and all
will be well by the morning.

02:11.823 --> 02:14.487
I never tire of your platitudes.

02:25.050 --> 02:27.489
- Easy now.
- I'm fine.

02:27.490 --> 02:30.409
It's all that Scotch.
Thank you, Arthur.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.450
Thank you.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.250
Oh, my God!

02:55.770 --> 02:58.449
Ah. Bram Stoker, Harry Houdini.

02:58.450 --> 03:00.849
It's an honour, sir.
I loved Dracula.

03:00.850 --> 03:02.689
I've read everything you've written,

03:02.690 --> 03:05.769
even your theatre reviews
from back in Dublin.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.810
(SILENCE)

03:10.450 --> 03:12.329
I didn't know the two
of you were friends.

03:12.330 --> 03:14.049
Very close, since childhood.

03:14.050 --> 03:17.649
My mother says we're distant
cousins but I could never
follow the genealogy.

03:17.650 --> 03:20.689
Mr Stoker, when was the last time
you saw your maid alive?

03:20.690 --> 03:22.769
Yesterday morning.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.049
Glynnis was in fine spirits.

03:25.050 --> 03:27.569
- I left for the day.
- Where did you go?

03:27.570 --> 03:30.489
A meeting with my publisher,
then a few errands.

03:30.490 --> 03:32.529
What kind of errands?

03:32.530 --> 03:34.809
(SILENCE)

03:34.810 --> 03:39.049
Mr Stoker, I need to know your
whereabouts for the entire day.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.729
If you're looking for a suspect,

03:40.730 --> 03:44.480
I suggest you start by finding the
man who followed me last night.

03:45.043 --> 03:48.568
Bram, is there anything you
haven't told me about him?

03:48.570 --> 03:51.290
Last night wasn't the first
time I encountered him.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.194
Bram Stoker?

03:59.899 --> 04:02.500
How did you get
in here? Who are you?

04:02.730 --> 04:05.849
- A protector of the innocent.
- Get out of my house!

04:05.850 --> 04:09.049
Your filthy book has
glorified evil.

04:09.050 --> 04:12.329
Soiling the pure with its
violence and obscenity.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.609
Well, I'm sorry if you feel soiled.

04:14.610 --> 04:17.689
You will stop this plague
from spreading.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.689
Stop the book from being published?
Impossible.

04:20.690 --> 04:23.129
Oh, you will stop the release.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.570
Or I promise you, there
will be retribution.

04:29.210 --> 04:32.329
You should keep your back door
locked. I thought I had.

04:32.330 --> 04:35.809
It's not unusual for obsessed fans
to come by.

04:35.810 --> 04:38.649
Self-professed "vampires"
seeking autographs,

04:38.650 --> 04:41.649
or "vampire hunters" accusing me

04:41.650 --> 04:44.289
of destroying the moral fabric
of our nation.

04:44.290 --> 04:47.649
Your book rattled a lot of people.
I like that.

04:47.650 --> 04:49.729
I underestimated the appeal
it would have

04:49.730 --> 04:53.889
for those banished to the fringe and
those wishing to exterminate them.

04:53.890 --> 04:59.329
But... I'd never had one of them
actually enter my home, threaten me.

04:59.330 --> 05:02.089
And yet, you didn't call
the police?

05:02.090 --> 05:06.209
If you engage with these people,
it just emboldens them.

05:06.210 --> 05:10.090
But now Glynnis... lies dead,
due to my mistake.

05:15.850 --> 05:18.409
I'll forward a description of
the man to Scotland Yard.

05:18.410 --> 05:19.887
Not much to go on without a name.

05:19.933 --> 05:22.866
Please, employ the utmost
discretion with this case.

05:22.869 --> 05:25.849
Bram hates his name in the papers,
even in the best circumstances.

05:25.850 --> 05:28.609
Your friend's an interesting guy.
Wouldn't shake my hand.

05:28.610 --> 05:32.329
It's nothing personal. He's just
not fond of any form of touching.

05:32.330 --> 05:35.689
- Kind of a quirk, you might say.
- Like wearing make-up?

05:35.690 --> 05:37.809
- Up close, I could tell.
- Yeah, I got that too.

05:37.810 --> 05:40.609
As if it were any of your business.

05:40.610 --> 05:43.209
- So you believe his story?
- Of course I do.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.809
As much as it pains me to agree
with Doyle, I do too.

05:46.810 --> 05:50.369
I know what it feels like having
obsessed fans hounding you.

05:50.370 --> 05:52.529
The number of times I've
come back to my hotel

05:52.530 --> 05:55.529
- to find a woman in my room.
- They're called housekeepers.

05:55.530 --> 05:57.529
It's got to be especially
hard for Stoker,

05:57.530 --> 06:01.729
having created the most famous
character in all of fiction.

06:01.730 --> 06:04.969
I'm not ruling out anyone as a
suspect, including Mr Stoker.

06:04.970 --> 06:07.969
Bram is incapable of such a crime.

06:07.970 --> 06:10.649
Yes, he's socially awkward.
But he's a loyal friend,

06:10.650 --> 06:12.369
who provided great encouragement

06:12.370 --> 06:15.409
when I decided to stop practicing
medicine and write full time.

06:15.410 --> 06:18.729
Hm-mm. That's great.
Good luck with that.

06:18.730 --> 06:22.089
Should we consider asking Bram's
publisher to hold off on the book,

06:22.090 --> 06:25.169
- until we get to the bottom of this?
- Giving the killer what he wants?

06:25.170 --> 06:27.089
- That's your solution?
- No. Of course not.

06:27.090 --> 06:30.129
But isn't our paramount
responsibility to keep Bram safe?

06:30.130 --> 06:32.570
Surely there are other
ways of doing that?

06:34.730 --> 06:36.570
Bram, you're coming with me.

06:46.450 --> 06:49.529
All settled in, Mr "Hollister?"

06:49.530 --> 06:51.649
I'm not settling in.

06:51.650 --> 06:54.009
My suite's just down the hall,
if you need me.

06:54.010 --> 06:56.169
My suite's just down the hall,
Duly noted.

06:56.170 --> 06:59.369
And the dining room here is amazing.
You'll love it.

06:59.370 --> 07:02.129
I'll take my meals in my room,
thank you.

07:02.130 --> 07:06.049
Don't worry. You'll be safe here, as
long as you don't arouse suspicion.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.289
I'll leave that to the large man
sat conspicuously in the hallway.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.049
I employed him for protection.

07:11.050 --> 07:14.209
He's under strict instructions not
to engage you in conversation.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.169
And to enter, only if invited.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.210
Which will be never.

07:21.770 --> 07:23.770
You're right. Quirky.

07:30.130 --> 07:35.569
The man who just checked in down
the hall, it's Bram Stoker, yes?

07:35.570 --> 07:38.689
Hopefully you're the only
one who realized that.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.729
Why is he here?

07:40.730 --> 07:44.329
He's taking a little vacation,
hoping to get some rest.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.689
- Why? Is something wrong?
- No, I just...

07:46.690 --> 07:51.569
When I read Dracula, it stirred
memories of my childhood in Hungary.

07:51.570 --> 07:56.249
People on the edge of the village.
Strigoi - undead.

07:56.250 --> 07:59.850
Said to change shape into wolves,
or bats, even mists.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.449
Old world superstitions. So silly.

08:06.450 --> 08:09.489
Well, if you want, I can pick up
some garlic while I'm out.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.489
Oh...
(CHUCKLES)

08:12.490 --> 08:15.089
Go.

08:15.090 --> 08:17.130
I have to get back to
Stoker's house.

08:20.050 --> 08:22.050
Up here, in the maid's room.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.111
What's wrong?

08:32.114 --> 08:33.527
We were gonna
ask you the same thing.

08:33.530 --> 08:37.169
You seemed a tad... curt earlier.

08:37.169 --> 08:40.250
We were wondering if something
might be troubling you?

08:49.810 --> 08:52.249
I assume you believe this is
from the anarchist group

08:52.250 --> 08:53.969
your husband was involved with?

08:53.970 --> 08:58.089
May have been involved with.
Yes, I think so.

08:58.090 --> 09:01.449
For a group of anarchists, they're
surprisingly well-organised.

09:01.450 --> 09:04.369
- You shouldn't be left alone.
- I don't need a bodyguard.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.729
No fingerprints were found
on the wooden stake.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.929
I spoke to Mr Stoker's neighbours.
They didn't see anyone come or go.

09:09.930 --> 09:13.449
But they have heard loud arguing in
the past. Now I've found this.

09:13.450 --> 09:16.929
A letter the maid was writing
to a friend, "Bram's changed.

09:16.930 --> 09:20.969
He's grown hostile. Our relationship
is at best difficult."

09:20.970 --> 09:24.089
Bram? First name basis.

09:24.090 --> 09:27.156
I think he may have dropped
his 'no touch' rule.

09:27.278 --> 09:28.289
Highly unlikely.

09:28.290 --> 09:33.040
"He revolts me now. Bloodless freak
of a man, nagging at every turn."

09:33.133 --> 09:34.430
Sounds like motive for murder.

09:34.432 --> 09:37.100
And then he uses his good friend,
Dr Doyle, as an alibi.

09:37.102 --> 09:38.715
Conveniently showing up
at your house,

09:38.717 --> 09:40.689
so the two of you can find
the body together.

09:40.690 --> 09:44.049
That's ridiculous. And I'm not going
to spend any more time on it.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.609
- Hey, where are you going?
- Bram referred me to a professor,

09:47.610 --> 09:49.889
who's an expert in the vampire cult.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.609
If the man who threatened Bram is
indeed some kind of vampire hunter,

09:53.610 --> 09:57.809
then perhaps this expert can
shed light on how to find him.

09:57.810 --> 10:00.410
Vampire expert?
Not ridiculous at all (!)

10:01.690 --> 10:04.169
The legends date back at
least 4,000 years

10:04.170 --> 10:06.609
to the ancient Assyrians
and Babylonians.

10:06.610 --> 10:10.753
Most of these legends arose from
fears of moral degradation.

10:10.956 --> 10:12.769
Bram said these superstitions
all but died away

10:12.770 --> 10:14.409
with the Industrial Revolution?

10:14.410 --> 10:17.770
They did... until he exhumed
them with Dracula.

10:20.090 --> 10:23.609
Sadly, he's had to deal with
some tragic repercussions.

10:23.610 --> 10:26.689
I tried to warn him while
researching his book.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.049
Is he all right now?
I hope he's somewhere safe?

10:29.050 --> 10:30.809
- Is he all right now?
- Yes, very safe.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.911
The man who threatened him,

10:32.913 --> 10:34.481
- he gave no name?
- No.

10:34.528 --> 10:36.809
He only said he was a,
"Protector of the innocent."

10:36.810 --> 10:38.569
I've heard that title.

10:38.570 --> 10:42.729
It's what the Vanatori often call
themselves. Vampire hunters.

10:42.730 --> 10:45.049
This is a cult of opposing forces.

10:45.050 --> 10:47.969
Troubled, often mentally ill people
claiming to be vampires,

10:47.970 --> 10:50.329
and the self-righteous zealots
who hunt them.

10:50.330 --> 10:55.449
My fans don deerstalker hats and
pipes, Bram's fans drink blood.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.809
with both groups,

10:57.810 --> 10:59.489
I've had my share of encounters
disrupting my lectures.

10:59.490 --> 11:03.129
They've also been known to kill
cattle to drink their blood,

11:03.130 --> 11:06.009
- vandalize cemeteries.
- Any cemeteries in particular?

11:06.010 --> 11:09.409
Try Southwood. There's a group
who've taken to sleeping in coffins,

11:09.410 --> 11:12.329
discarding the bones of the deceased
who were resting in them.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.049
These cults do not take kindly

11:14.050 --> 11:16.849
to the outside world interfering
in their war.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.210
I fear they won't hesitate
to kill again.

11:26.290 --> 11:27.392
What's that?

11:27.392 --> 11:30.008
Cricket score sheets,
hundreds of them.

11:30.010 --> 11:31.729
But only matches Doyle played in.

11:31.730 --> 11:33.609
Stoker went to every
single one of them.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.969
Took copious notes,
from start to finish.

11:35.970 --> 11:37.969
Don't those matches
take days to play?

11:37.970 --> 11:40.410
- A loyal friend indeed.
- Oh, and look at this.

11:42.730 --> 11:45.609
They're an advertisement
for tweed.

11:45.610 --> 11:48.049
That's Italy.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.849
Happy memory?

11:49.850 --> 11:53.089
My husband took me there
before we were married.

11:53.090 --> 11:55.130
Unchaperoned?

11:57.290 --> 12:00.969
We both told her we were sick one
morning, staying in our rooms.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.489
Snuck off, rowed out onto Lake Como.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.209
He wanted to teach me how to fish.

12:06.210 --> 12:09.809
Tied on his prized fish hook,
guaranteed me we'd catch a boat-full.

12:09.810 --> 12:12.410
- Let me guess, not a bite?
- Not even a hint.

12:15.490 --> 12:18.769
Well, that can't be the
end of the story?

12:18.770 --> 12:22.289
The weather turned. Trapped on the lake
for an hour, soaked to the skin.

12:22.290 --> 12:25.769
My aunt would have killed us.

12:25.770 --> 12:27.810
Except, before we rowed in...

12:30.770 --> 12:34.609
...Benjamin surprised me with the
real reason he brought me there.

12:34.610 --> 12:37.330
He proposed to me in the
pouring rain.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.850
He sounds like a hell of a guy.

12:50.450 --> 12:53.209
What's wrong?

12:53.210 --> 12:55.250
Nothing.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.296
Um...

12:56.530 --> 12:58.530
I too found something interesting.

13:00.690 --> 13:03.643
Several payments Mr Stoker
made to his maid.

13:03.645 --> 13:05.478
So? She worked for the man.

13:05.486 --> 13:08.525
Then she's the highest
paid maid in history.

13:10.370 --> 13:12.370
(PHONE RINGS)

13:17.170 --> 13:19.170
Hello?

13:21.130 --> 13:23.329
Blackmail? Over an affair?

13:23.330 --> 13:26.473
Neither of them is married,
it's hardly scandalous.

13:26.475 --> 13:27.545
At least not for him.

13:27.547 --> 13:29.247
Perhaps she
discovered something incriminating?

13:29.250 --> 13:32.009
There's nothing incriminating.
It's a wild goose chase.

13:32.010 --> 13:34.769
Unlike being called to the
cemetery to look for vampires.

13:34.770 --> 13:38.129
This expert you met, does he really
believe vampires exist?

13:38.130 --> 13:40.571
- No.
- Doyle, however...

13:40.573 --> 13:43.129
I remain willing to consider all
scientific possibilities.

13:43.130 --> 13:46.289
Yes. Problem is, you think there's
no end to scientific possibilities.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.597
According to Darwin,

13:47.599 --> 13:50.808
species continually adapt to
higher forms in order to survive.

13:50.810 --> 13:53.169
The ultimate form of which
is immortality.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.129
- Nothing lives forever.
- Exactly.

13:55.130 --> 13:56.889
The only path to immortality
is fame.

13:56.890 --> 13:59.449
People will be talking about
me for hundreds of years.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.890
And you... for at least a dozen.

14:07.490 --> 14:09.169
You're trespassing in our home.

14:09.170 --> 14:11.649
No, your home is the basement
of your mother's house,

14:11.650 --> 14:14.009
where you spend 20 hours
a day reading fantasy.

14:14.010 --> 14:16.289
- This is where you act them out.
- We mean you no harm.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.369
I'm Constable Stratton
of Scotland Yard.

14:18.370 --> 14:22.329
We're investigating the murder of
Bram Stoker's maid, Glynnis Conway.

14:22.330 --> 14:25.129
We have a suspect.
A man in his late 20's.

14:25.130 --> 14:28.730
Tall, dark hair, athletically built,
scar below his left eye.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.129
- We know nothing about him.
- Your face says otherwise.

14:34.130 --> 14:39.529
- Where is Mr Stoker now?
- Well protected.Impossible.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.810
Only we know how to protect our own.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.490
If you have any knowledge,
you must come forward.

14:55.810 --> 14:57.810
Our own?

15:01.090 --> 15:03.090
(OPERATIC SINGING)

16:26.440 --> 16:29.440
- What's wrong?
- Mr Stoker has left the hotel.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.000
- Where did he go?
- Mr Stoker? Nowhere.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.200
Open the door.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.080
What are you doing?

16:59.640 --> 17:02.439
- You promised me...
- Did you go out tonight?

17:02.440 --> 17:04.799
- Why would I do that?
- I would have seen him leave.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.039
- I've been here all night.
- Maybe he went out the window?

17:08.040 --> 17:09.563
We're on the top floor.

17:09.563 --> 17:11.256
You could have lowered
yourself on a rope

17:11.258 --> 17:14.757
- or climbed down the drain pipe.
- Or perhaps I crawled down the wall?

17:16.560 --> 17:19.200
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm trying to work.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.880
Come on, Mum.

(ECHOES OF SCREAMS AND EXPLOSIONS)

17:36.800 --> 17:38.800
(ECHOES OF GUNFIRE)

18:17.560 --> 18:19.279
I'm certain it was him.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.040
He turned toward the street
and then he was gone.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.239
Ma, you look tired.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.959
What's wrong?

18:28.960 --> 18:31.639
I'm so grateful to you
for bringing me here.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.879
But sometimes the hotel
gets so quiet. Empty.

18:35.880 --> 18:39.039
I find myself thinking...

18:39.040 --> 18:43.346
- About what?
- Salt water taffy.

18:43.348 --> 18:44.448
Coney Island.

18:44.854 --> 18:47.038
- The Steeplechase Horse Race.
- Your favourite.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.440
You and Theo would ride all day,
if I let you.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.879
You're homesick.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.679
It's selfish of me to keep you here.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.639
You should go back to New York,
see the family.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.919
No, Harry.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.359
I want to stay here.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.400
Where you are, I am.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.119
- That won't be necessary.
- How did you get in here?

19:31.120 --> 19:33.399
I don't have much time.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.079
The others would be angry if they
knew I was speaking to you.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.519
My name is Liliana.
I know the man you seek.

19:39.520 --> 19:42.479
- The man who killed Mr Stoker's maid?
- A vanator.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.959
A vampire hunter by the name
of Lachlan McBride.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.679
- Where can we find him?
- I don't know.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.519
But it's important the police
find him before the others do.

19:50.520 --> 19:54.279
- I must go now.
- Wait.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.159
Why are you telling me this?

19:56.160 --> 19:59.159
The maid was not part of our world.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.239
McBride brought dishonour
by killing her.

20:01.240 --> 20:06.080
Her death should be dealt with
by your authorities, not ours.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.280
(BREEZE BLOWS)

20:16.920 --> 20:20.119
Was Glynnis having any financial
difficulties? No.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.199
She never mentioned
any debts she owed?

20:22.200 --> 20:25.279
Or that she was having difficulty
making ends meet on her salary?

20:25.280 --> 20:28.840
- Nonsense. I paid her well.
- Yeah? How well?

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
You searched my private records?

20:34.760 --> 20:37.719
How could you allow such an
invasion of my privacy?!

20:37.720 --> 20:41.320
- Dr Doyle has no say in this matter.
- She's blackmailing you, isn't she?

20:42.040 --> 20:44.920
Mr Stoker, your silence only
enhances suspicion.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.767
- Bram?
- Glynnis...

20:52.300 --> 20:54.300
discovered something about me.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.239
Something extremely private.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.119
She threatened to reveal it
publicly.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.399
I paid her to remain silent.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.400
What did she discover?

21:06.200 --> 21:08.200
Will you tell me in private?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.399
(CHOKED) I can't.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.199
I'm sorry, Arthur. But it has
nothing to do with this crime.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.240
You have my word as a friend.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.559
So that's it? He says,

21:23.560 --> 21:25.719
"You have my word," and
you're fine with that?

21:25.720 --> 21:28.719
It doesn't matter what the maid
discovered. It's still motive.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.559
I'm saying we need to be pursuing
other leads as well.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.639
One of the vampires from the
cemetery came to see me last night.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.039
The crazy people are actual
vampires now (?)

21:37.040 --> 21:40.439
She gave me the name of a vampire
hunter - Lachlan McBride.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.159
She said he's the one
who threatened Bram.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.200
I'll track down his address.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.680
Are you all right?

22:07.120 --> 22:08.753
Did you get any sleep
at all last night?

22:08.799 --> 22:09.799
Yes.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.680
I had a terrible dream.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.080
I dreamt you left me forever.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.560
What?

22:24.600 --> 22:26.600
- That's crazy.
- Hm-mm.

22:27.800 --> 22:31.680
I've never given dreams much weight,
but this one... It was so real.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.960
You're just spooked.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.560
Ever since the 'Count' moved in
down the hall.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.920
- You need to go home.
- No.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.759
I'll never leave you.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.782
I fear something terrible may happen.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.361
Oh, I'm going with you.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.799
I'll book us two tickets,
Liverpool to New York.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.559
See the family.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.479
Eat as much salt water taffy
as we can stuff in our faces.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.040
- You don't have to do that.
- I know I don't.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.920
I want to.

23:10.240 --> 23:14.440
I'm not leaving you, Ma... ever.

Your best pals

23:42.840 --> 23:44.800
Ready for action. Good girl.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.559
We have the address.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.079
Which was interesting.
That we got it, instead of you.

23:54.080 --> 23:56.639
Why are you here and not
at Scotland Yard?

23:56.640 --> 23:58.680
What's all this?

24:04.760 --> 24:07.719
That photo of Lake Como... had
me thinking.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.439
The anarchist group was involved in
various assassinations around the world.

24:11.440 --> 24:14.599
England, America, Russia,
Spain, Switzerland.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.319
And one in Milan, Italy.

24:16.320 --> 24:19.599
Which occurred during the exact time
of our trip to nearby Lake Como.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.039
He travelled a lot,
usually without me.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.599
Hey. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.879
I love Twain. What?

24:26.880 --> 24:28.840
I like great literature.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.520
- That was my husband's favourite book.
- I'll return it.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.199
I went through his records

24:38.200 --> 24:41.879
and I discovered that on the exact
date of all seven assassinations,

24:41.880 --> 24:43.639
he was within 50 miles
of the event.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.359
Dear God.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.039
Benjamin was trying to expose
this group. I'm sure of it.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.119
I think he may have been
a government agent.

24:50.120 --> 24:53.999
He was in all these places and yet he
couldn't stop any of the assassinations?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.719
- You didn't know him.
- I agree.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.479
Only those we know us best, know
what we're truly capable of.

24:58.480 --> 25:01.559
And only those who know us best,
know the easiest way to deceive us.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.559
My husband would never deceive me.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.720
And Stoker would never
deceive Doyle.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.199
What's the address?

25:12.200 --> 25:14.240
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

25:15.920 --> 25:17.920
(DOOR CREAKS)

25:19.120 --> 25:21.120
Hello? Mr McBride?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.160
Look at this.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.320
Mr McBride?

25:57.280 --> 25:59.280
He's dead.

26:04.455 --> 26:06.892
Doors and windows were
all locked, you say?

26:06.894 --> 26:09.054
Yes. No sign of forced entry anywhere.

26:09.055 --> 26:12.094
Oh, vampires can shape-shift, right?

26:12.095 --> 26:14.774
So the murderer just... slipped
under the door, did he?

26:14.775 --> 26:17.254
More likely McBride knew the
murderer and let him in.

26:17.255 --> 26:20.494
The only thing we know for certain
is that Bram is no longer a suspect.

26:20.495 --> 26:23.159
He's been locked up and under
guard for two days.

26:23.479 --> 26:24.479
Sir.

26:32.015 --> 26:34.534
- What happened?
- I don't know.

26:34.535 --> 26:38.374
I thought I heard a noise inside,
so I knocked and there's no answer.

26:38.375 --> 26:40.415
I entered to find Mr Stoker gone.

26:41.415 --> 26:43.787
Perhaps he fashioned a way
to climb down the wall.

26:43.907 --> 26:44.907
Why?

26:45.335 --> 26:47.854
We'll ask him when we find him.

26:47.855 --> 26:49.895
I know where to start looking.

26:57.855 --> 26:59.694
Why this street?

26:59.695 --> 27:02.534
My mother thought she saw Stoker
leave the hotel last night.

27:02.535 --> 27:04.814
He denied it, so I let it go.

27:04.815 --> 27:07.134
But she said she saw him
turn down this street.

27:07.135 --> 27:08.892
Does Mr Stoker know anyone near here?

27:08.894 --> 27:09.894
No.

27:10.267 --> 27:13.134
- Not that you know of.
- Yes, I get it.

27:13.135 --> 27:15.494
It's starting to appear
that I may not know Bram

27:15.495 --> 27:17.454
quite as well as I'd assumed.

27:17.455 --> 27:19.454
- And that upsets you?
- Shouldn't it?

27:19.455 --> 27:21.814
Does he know you? Does he
know all your secrets?

27:21.815 --> 27:24.214
No-one knows what goes on
behind closed doors.

27:24.215 --> 27:26.414
- Unless you live with someone.
- Even then.

27:26.415 --> 27:28.446
It's not the doors that keep
secrets from getting out.

27:28.517 --> 27:29.517
Look.

27:49.215 --> 27:51.215
I didn't kill anyone.

27:57.935 --> 28:00.094
I have a condition.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.814
It makes me anaemic.

28:01.815 --> 28:05.534
I've found that drinking
cow's blood provides relief.

28:05.535 --> 28:08.534
Confined to that dreary hotel room,
I'd grown desperate.

28:08.535 --> 28:11.054
But I went only to the butcher shop.

28:11.055 --> 28:13.414
Bram, your teeth...

28:13.415 --> 28:16.495
...they're like fangs. I've never
noticed them before.

28:21.255 --> 28:23.174
I've always had bad teeth.

28:23.175 --> 28:25.454
They've grown worse in recent years.

28:25.455 --> 28:28.975
I hide them, by not smiling or
engaging in conversation.

28:31.775 --> 28:33.974
I have many peculiarities, Arthur.

28:33.975 --> 28:36.815
But being a vampire
is not among them.

28:38.175 --> 28:41.215
Fetch some garlic, or a crucifix
if you wish to test me.

28:52.175 --> 28:56.934
My condition also renders me
sensitive to sunlight,

28:56.935 --> 28:59.694
but as you can see,
I've not turned to dust.

28:59.695 --> 29:02.414
I also cast a shadow,
and a reflection.

29:02.415 --> 29:05.734
I cannot summon an army of rats
or a storm in the sky,

29:05.735 --> 29:09.855
because all those vampire traits
are fiction.

29:18.775 --> 29:21.815
An ill deed it was, to breathe
life into Dracula.

29:24.575 --> 29:27.415
An albatross that hangs
heavily upon my neck.

29:34.375 --> 29:38.134
All this time, the truth has been
staring me in the face.

29:38.135 --> 29:41.934
Tertiary syphilis. The final stage
of the disease.

29:41.935 --> 29:43.814
Symptoms include anaemia, trembling,

29:43.815 --> 29:46.974
sensitivity to sunlight
and erosion of teeth.

29:46.975 --> 29:49.334
Apparently I'm the only one
he wouldn't touch.

29:49.335 --> 29:52.174
How he contracted the disease
is irrelevant.

29:52.175 --> 29:54.094
Those afflicted are
needlessly saddled

29:54.095 --> 29:56.494
with great embarrassment and shame.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.654
Their disfigurement becoming a
hideous Scarlet "A",

29:59.655 --> 30:02.494
alerting the world to
their past sins.

30:02.495 --> 30:05.455
Now we know what his maid was
blackmailing him about.

30:22.255 --> 30:25.374
So, you believe this
"vampire hunter"

30:25.375 --> 30:27.494
- is the man who killed the maid?
- I do.

30:27.495 --> 30:29.414
The vampires then killed
him in revenge.

30:29.415 --> 30:31.494
They're not real vampires,
you understand?

30:31.495 --> 30:34.415
Just a cult of crazy people
waging a kind of Gothic feud.

30:35.895 --> 30:37.654
And you believe this as well?

30:37.655 --> 30:40.774
I'm not as willing to dismiss
Mr Stoker as a suspect.

30:40.775 --> 30:43.854
He still has motives for killing
both his maid and Mr McBride

30:43.855 --> 30:45.894
and no way of proving
his whereabouts.

30:45.895 --> 30:47.614
For years I've tried to protect him,

30:47.615 --> 30:49.998
defending him when others were
quick to marginalise him

30:49.998 --> 30:51.373
from "polite" society.

30:51.375 --> 30:54.654
He has his eccentricities but
I know he's not a murderer.

30:54.655 --> 30:56.695
Stoker's escaped.

31:00.855 --> 31:03.574
I broke out of the same exact cell,
two years ago.

31:03.575 --> 31:06.254
- How did you do it?
- Flawlessly.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.534
The point is, it can be done.

31:08.535 --> 31:10.614
Merring's reprimanding
the guard on duty.

31:10.615 --> 31:13.404
He's been called to task
for falling asleep in the past,

31:13.405 --> 31:15.094
though he swears he didn't this time.

31:15.095 --> 31:17.494
Perhaps someone drugged
the guard or hypnotized him?

31:17.495 --> 31:20.414
We have every available constable
out searching the streets.

31:20.415 --> 31:22.455
I suggest we join 'em.

31:23.695 --> 31:26.294
You don't need to tell us how
you did it, but tell us this.

31:26.295 --> 31:29.174
Is there any way that Bram Stoker
could have done what you did,

31:29.175 --> 31:32.295
- without assistance?
- Uh-uh.

31:34.935 --> 31:39.334
The vampires said, "Only we know
how to protect our own."

31:39.335 --> 31:41.415
We should be searching the cemetery.

31:45.573 --> 31:47.026
You didn't happen
to bring a gun, did you?

31:47.028 --> 31:48.028
No.

31:48.335 --> 31:50.334
- Crucifix?
- Shush.

31:50.335 --> 31:53.374
It's a big cemetery. We should
split up, cover more ground.

31:53.375 --> 31:56.614
- That is a terrible idea.
- All right.

31:56.615 --> 32:00.694
Come on, if we stay together, we'll
be searching this place all night.

32:00.695 --> 32:03.454
I'll err on the side of caution
over expediency, thank you.

32:03.455 --> 32:06.934
All right, fine, if you're afraid,
Adelaide can stay with you.

32:06.935 --> 32:08.654
What I am is not stupid.

32:08.655 --> 32:11.574
If someone did break Mr Stoker out,
and he didn't go willingly,

32:11.575 --> 32:13.654
his life may be in danger
at this very moment.

32:13.655 --> 32:16.014
(SIGHS)
Fine, we'll split up.

32:16.015 --> 32:18.854
If you find Bram or the vampires,
give a sharp whistle.

32:18.855 --> 32:22.014
(MUMBLES)

32:22.015 --> 32:24.974
I don't know how to whistle.

32:24.975 --> 32:28.134
You're American. I thought that was
the first thing they taught you?

32:28.135 --> 32:31.934
Just put your fingers in your mouth
and blow like this.(WHISTLES)

32:31.935 --> 32:34.414
- (BLOWS OUT AIR)
- No, no, place your fingers like so...

32:34.415 --> 32:35.454
(WHISTLES)

32:35.455 --> 32:37.814
(GROANS)
If you find anyone, just shout out.

32:37.815 --> 32:39.735
- (GROANS)
- (BLOWING OF AIR AND WHISTLING)

33:12.175 --> 33:14.175
(GRUNTS)

33:18.855 --> 33:20.734
Help! Help!

33:20.735 --> 33:23.574
Get me out of here! Please!

33:23.575 --> 33:25.494
- Somebody!
- Bram, is that you?

33:25.495 --> 33:27.535
Please! Please!

33:27.855 --> 33:29.734
(DOOR GRINDS OPEN)

33:29.735 --> 33:32.094
- Arthur. Thank God!
- (WHISTLES)

33:32.095 --> 33:34.374
- What happened?
- A woman took me from the jail.

33:34.375 --> 33:37.174
She claimed to be a vampire.

33:37.175 --> 33:39.535
She brought me here,
she sealed the door!

33:41.695 --> 33:46.094
It's no word of a lie, Arthur.
It happened as I say.

33:46.095 --> 33:48.174
- Mr Stoker.
- Where is this woman now?

33:48.175 --> 33:50.694
I don't know. She left me.
She went off into the night.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.574
Were there other people
with her? No.

33:52.575 --> 33:55.654
She spoke of other vampires
but said they'd fled London

33:55.655 --> 33:57.814
when they heard that McBride
had been killed.

33:57.815 --> 34:00.174
They feared they would be
accused of the murder.

34:00.175 --> 34:02.334
If they didn't do it, who did?

34:02.335 --> 34:04.335
(RUSTLING)

34:06.455 --> 34:08.415
Houdini?

34:09.775 --> 34:11.775
Go back inside, stay there.

34:19.815 --> 34:21.534
Professor Havensglin.

34:21.534 --> 34:24.574
- What're you doing here?
- I'm here to kill Mr Stoker.

34:26.455 --> 34:30.094
- You're a vanator?
- I'm a protector of the innocent.

34:30.094 --> 34:33.293
The Strigoi have terrorised this
world for hundreds of years.

34:33.295 --> 34:36.054
What about Mr Stoker's maid?
She was no vampire.

34:36.054 --> 34:37.813
I didn't kill her. Mr McBride did.

34:37.815 --> 34:39.534
He was an overzealous follower

34:39.534 --> 34:42.214
who disgraced himself
by killing that maid.

34:42.215 --> 34:44.974
So you murdered him and
drained his blood

34:44.975 --> 34:46.934
to make it appear the
vampires did it?

34:46.935 --> 34:50.014
He needed to be punished,
as does Bram Stoker.

34:50.014 --> 34:53.774
His book emboldened the Strigoi,
attracting more into the fold,

34:53.774 --> 34:55.773
spreading filth among the virtuous.

34:55.775 --> 34:56.976
So tell me where he is?!

34:56.978 --> 34:58.973
- I will not.
- Quite the contrary.

34:58.975 --> 35:01.454
- You're under arrest -
- Tell me where Mr Stoker is,

35:01.455 --> 35:03.615
or I won't tell you where
Mr Houdini is.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.934
Help!

35:13.935 --> 35:15.654
- (MUFFLED)
- Hello?!

35:15.655 --> 35:20.214
- (KNOCKING)
- Somebody help!

35:20.215 --> 35:22.255
HELP!

35:23.175 --> 35:25.054
HELP!

35:25.860 --> 35:28.099
Mr Houdini is buried in
one of these graves.

35:28.100 --> 35:30.619
Even with his skills,
escape is unlikely.

35:30.620 --> 35:33.300
I'll tell you where the grave is,
when you take me to Bram.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.139
Stoker!

35:37.140 --> 35:39.299
Search the graves,
look for fresh soil.

35:39.300 --> 35:41.340
Houdini won't last long!

35:48.900 --> 35:50.900
(EXHALES)

36:09.820 --> 36:11.820
(BREATHY WHISTLE)

36:14.780 --> 36:16.780
(WHISTLES)

36:20.860 --> 36:22.860

36:23.380 --> 36:25.380
(WHISTLE)

36:45.860 --> 36:47.820
Bram?!

36:55.700 --> 36:57.859

(LABOURED BREATHING)

37:22.940 --> 37:24.779
(GRUNTS)

37:24.780 --> 37:26.659
Bram, I know you're in here.

37:26.660 --> 37:31.179
Show yourself, or I will cut
Dr Doyle's throat.

37:31.180 --> 37:33.220
(STRAINS AND CREAKING)

37:50.060 --> 37:52.859
- Show yourself, Stoker!
- Don't do it, Bram!

37:52.860 --> 37:54.859
He'll kill me anyway.
Save yourself.

37:54.860 --> 37:55.900
(CRASH)

38:00.940 --> 38:02.940
(STRAINS)

38:14.420 --> 38:16.420
Houdini?!

38:30.580 --> 38:32.539
I'll toss you in the flames.

38:32.540 --> 38:34.699
You can burn with the other paupers.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.740
(YELLS AND STRAINS)

38:39.100 --> 38:41.100
(SCREAMING)

38:42.740 --> 38:44.740
Dr Doyle?!

38:52.820 --> 38:54.820
I heard him whistle.

39:04.620 --> 39:05.620
(EARTH RUMBLES)

39:05.621 --> 39:07.660

(COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS)

39:17.420 --> 39:18.579
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

39:18.580 --> 39:22.459
I gotta put this in my act.
(COUGHS)

39:22.460 --> 39:24.500
Where's Mr Stoker?

39:25.860 --> 39:27.860
Dead.

39:27.980 --> 39:31.340
He and Professor Havensglin...
fell into the furnace...

39:34.860 --> 39:37.379
Bram?

39:37.380 --> 39:41.180
As you can see, I'm still
very much alive.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.299
Only Havensglin went in.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.019
I fell to the side,

39:47.020 --> 39:49.700
rendered unconscious behind
one of the crates.

39:50.380 --> 39:53.660
Your fans are crazy.
(COUGHS)

39:58.980 --> 40:00.659
I just realised something.

40:00.660 --> 40:03.979
Your vampire hunter from Dracula,
Van Helsing,

40:03.980 --> 40:07.219
that name is an anagram
of Havensglin.

40:07.220 --> 40:10.379
I chose it as an homage
to the professor.

40:10.380 --> 40:13.420
It's quite ironic he turned
out to be an actual vanator.

40:16.460 --> 40:18.460
Ah, they're for friends.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.860
Will you inscribe it?

40:24.540 --> 40:26.540
If I must.

40:46.060 --> 40:48.579
You know my secret.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.179
I'm a doctor.

40:51.180 --> 40:53.220
How long...

40:56.420 --> 40:58.420
...before I lose my mind?

41:02.300 --> 41:04.300
My final years, spent in madness?

41:06.780 --> 41:08.780
At least your book will live on.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.260
And through it, so will you.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.700
Let us each embrace the albatross
around our necks.

41:21.140 --> 41:23.420
Well, most people are
fickle and forgetful.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.900
Most.

41:46.620 --> 41:49.139
You needn't escort me
all the way home.

41:49.140 --> 41:54.699
I just want to make sure there are
no anarchists lying in wait.

41:54.700 --> 41:56.859
I found a telegram sent
from my husband

41:56.860 --> 41:59.739
to a Mr Walbridge of
Buffalo, New York,

41:59.740 --> 42:03.299
enquiring about firearms sold at
Mr Walbridge's hardware store.

42:03.300 --> 42:05.580
Firearms? Well, that can't be good.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.620
The gate's ajar.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.700
Just wait a second.

42:23.540 --> 42:25.540
I'm a police officer.

42:27.660 --> 42:30.219
You're also the target.

42:30.220 --> 42:32.260
- Oh, God.
- What?

42:35.740 --> 42:37.980
Benjamin's things.
They've taken them.

42:41.260 --> 42:43.260
All of them.

42:53.580 --> 42:55.580
This was about him.

43:14.980 --> 43:16.980
We're going to Buffalo.

43:22.220 --> 43:24.740
I'm taking my mother back
to New York anyway.

43:26.540 --> 43:28.540
No big deal.

43:31.060 --> 43:33.060
Thank you.

43:50.220 --> 43:52.220
Ma?

44:03.540 --> 44:05.540
