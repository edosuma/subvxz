Patty's dad came by
and offered Dan $50.000...

14:52.415 --> 14:54.575
...not to go through with the marriage.

14:54.750 --> 15:00.420
And the best we could do for entertainment
was the Beaver's mother in a halter top.

15:01.923 --> 15:04.153
Good little dancer. though.

15:05.893 --> 15:10.353
Dan was offered $50,000
to call the wedding off?

15:10.531 --> 15:12.661
Yeah. and he turned it down.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.463
He did?

15:14.969 --> 15:17.369
Well. wait a minute.
of course he turned it down.

15:17.538 --> 15:20.238
He's waiting for the big score.
The whole 40 million.

15:20.675 --> 15:21.835
DAN:
That's not true.

15:23.943 --> 15:26.103
I'm sorry. Dan. but it is true.

15:26.278 --> 15:29.178
You're marrying this girl for one reason.
You want the money.

15:29.715 --> 15:31.335
Is that what you think?

15:32.785 --> 15:34.245
Is that what you all think?

15:34.420 --> 15:35.940
-No way.
-No. of course not.

15:37.288 --> 15:39.258
-Well. yeah.
-Sort of.

15:40.892 --> 15:44.802
Okay. okay. I admit it.
that in the beginning it was the 40 million.

15:45.663 --> 15:48.263
But over the past two weeks.
something has happened.

15:48.932 --> 15:51.592
Interest has accumulated.

15:53.502 --> 15:55.972
Won't anyone around here
give me a break?

15:56.138 --> 15:58.398
Bail reports.

15:58.574 --> 16:02.944
One for Harry. one for Billie.

16:03.112 --> 16:06.452
And one for the sleaze puppy.

16:08.150 --> 16:10.810
Yeah. okay. okay. I get the picture.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.317
And I even understand
why you feel this way.

16:15.658 --> 16:17.818
I'm not saying there aren't differences.

16:17.992 --> 16:22.662
Socially. she's a little underprivileged.

16:23.897 --> 16:29.837
But when we're alone.
I feel good. very good.

16:31.171 --> 16:35.231
Relaxed. wanted and accepted.

16:36.909 --> 16:39.839
You know that crazy stuff
that we all carry around inside of us?

16:40.012 --> 16:43.212
That stuff that eats holes in your brain
and churns at your insides?

16:43.383 --> 16:47.953
That stuff that you know you cannot
possibly tell another living human being?

16:49.021 --> 16:50.851
I can tell her.

16:51.357 --> 16:54.727
And she listens. and she understands.

16:56.129 --> 16:58.119
And she says it's all right.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.929
It's all right.

17:03.736 --> 17:04.955
And it is.

17:06.137 --> 17:09.728
Poof. Just like your magic. Harry.
she makes my problems disappear...

17:09.907 --> 17:13.968
...my anxieties subside. God's in his heaven.
all is right with the world.

17:14.146 --> 17:16.705
There's no way to go but up.
look for the silver lining.

17:16.882 --> 17:19.942
I'll be damned if that's not what
every one of us is looking for.

17:20.117 --> 17:23.518
And I just happened to find mine.
so the best of luck to the rest of you.

17:27.424 --> 17:30.694
Ladies and gentlemen.
a small peek into the guts of Dan Fielding.

17:30.860 --> 17:33.020
No cover. no minimum.

17:34.897 --> 17:36.827
I'm sorry. Dan. I feel like....

17:37.266 --> 17:39.026
Slug slime?

17:41.203 --> 17:45.473
Well. if you'll excuse me...

17:47.242 --> 17:50.182
...I'm going to have lunch
with my fiancÃ©e.

17:59.321 --> 18:03.491
Wanna go first
or should we all jump together?

18:09.164 --> 18:11.464
-Hi.
-Sorry I'm late.

18:11.632 --> 18:15.902
That's all right. I have just been sitting here
giving thought to our honeymoon.

18:16.070 --> 18:18.370
Dan. we have to talk.

18:18.538 --> 18:21.238
Okay. you wanna pick the place
we go on the honeymoon.

18:21.408 --> 18:23.498
Since you're paying for it.
I guess it's fair.

18:23.677 --> 18:29.167
Dan. Daddy threatened to cut off my money
if I go ahead with this marriage.

18:29.349 --> 18:32.509
Cut it off? So you didn't tell him
we've been fooling around?

18:32.686 --> 18:34.246
Dan....

18:35.222 --> 18:38.322
He is absolutely serious.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.122
He would do that to keep us apart?

18:40.293 --> 18:42.633
He doesn't understand
that what we have together...

18:42.796 --> 18:45.766
...is too strong to be ruined
by something as base as money.

18:46.765 --> 18:48.725
No. it isn't.

18:50.269 --> 18:51.329
I beg your pardon?

18:52.137 --> 18:56.267
Dan. I can't marry you.

18:57.109 --> 18:58.769
What? You're talking crazy.

18:58.943 --> 19:00.933
Are you hungry?
Come on. have some zucchini.

19:01.112 --> 19:03.512
Dan. can you imagine me
without money?

19:03.681 --> 19:06.241
Come on. I don't know
how to do anything.

19:07.685 --> 19:08.705
Like what?

19:09.921 --> 19:11.721
Live.

19:12.090 --> 19:16.120
I don't know how to organize
kitchen help.

19:16.294 --> 19:19.464
I don't know which fork to use
for the salad.

19:19.631 --> 19:23.121
I don't even know the difference
between whip and purÃ©e.

19:24.402 --> 19:26.302
One is a cooking term.

19:30.041 --> 19:33.841
Don't you understand?
I just can't make it.

19:34.445 --> 19:36.105
You can try.

19:36.747 --> 19:40.477
I did try once. and I almost died.

19:41.685 --> 19:44.015
-Died?
-Yeah.

19:44.755 --> 19:47.615
I got mad at Daddy
and ran away from home.

19:47.791 --> 19:50.091
-Did you have to live on the streets?
-No.

19:50.259 --> 19:53.319
Jenkins drove me to our condo
in the Hamptons.

19:54.764 --> 19:56.394
My God.

19:56.899 --> 19:59.229
And when I got there.
I didn't have any money.

19:59.402 --> 20:02.242
And all that was in the house
was canned food.

20:03.806 --> 20:07.966
And I didn't know how to work
the electric can opener.

20:09.145 --> 20:13.275
I mean. I know it sounds ridiculous.
but I could've starved.

20:14.216 --> 20:18.876
-You have me to open your cans now.
-Dan. you don't understand. I love you...

20:19.055 --> 20:21.385
...but I'm just too scared
to live without money.

20:21.557 --> 20:24.647
I can't do it. I never learned how.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.300
You are really terrified. aren't you?

20:33.469 --> 20:35.159
I'm seeing a shrink.

20:38.573 --> 20:43.073
Listen. maybe someday |'||--

20:44.079 --> 20:46.609
Learn how to use a can opener?

20:49.918 --> 20:51.318
Yeah.

20:54.189 --> 20:56.019
Goodbye. Dan.

20:56.925 --> 20:57.945
Patty....

21:04.899 --> 21:06.729
I'll get the tip.

21:08.770 --> 21:10.470
I'll miss you.

21:26.087 --> 21:30.577
-Hey. Dan. how's it going?
-Oh. fine. fine. couldn't be better.

21:30.759 --> 21:33.129
Oh. did I mention the wedding's off?

21:33.895 --> 21:38.625
Her dad threatened to cut off her money
if she went through with the marriage.

21:38.933 --> 21:40.633
I told her we didn't need the money.

21:41.136 --> 21:42.926
And she called it off?

21:44.638 --> 21:49.198
Yeah. I finally found someone
weaker than me.

21:50.878 --> 21:52.808
Dan. I'm sorry.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.584
I know this isn't much consolation...

21:55.749 --> 22:00.849
...but you did have 14 wonderful days
with that girl.

22:01.021 --> 22:06.651
Which is roughly 13 more
than you've ever had with anyone else.

22:08.962 --> 22:13.132
Harry. as far as pep talks go.
that blows chunks.

22:15.869 --> 22:21.639
Hi. Dan. I haven't seen you for weeks.
You were supposed to call.

22:22.376 --> 22:25.206
-Sorry.
-You can make it up by taking me to lunch.

22:25.379 --> 22:28.349
No. no. no. I can't. I can't.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.384
I've just been through
a devastating emotional experience...

22:31.551 --> 22:36.551
...and I'm going to need a sufficient
amount of time to get back on my feet.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.593
So how about a late dinner?

22:49.936 --> 22:53.736
It's not like a close family member
died or anything.

22:53.906 --> 22:58.036
Sure. for that.
she'd have to wait until breakfast.

22:59.144 --> 23:03.884
Yeah. come on. Selma. Seeing somebody in
mourning really brings me down too.

23:13.558 --> 23:17.018
DAN: Harry....
HARRY: It's all right.
