WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:04.613
Previously on <i>S.W.A.T....</i> Officer Luca?

00:04.613 --> 00:07.268
- Yeah.
- My name is Eva Durant.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.617
I'm your sister.

00:08.617 --> 00:09.922
What are
you talking about?

00:09.922 --> 00:12.273
- I don't have a sister.
- I'm afraid you do.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.970
<i>I get that this isn't something
he wants to believe,</i>

00:13.970 --> 00:15.450
but it's the truth.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.060
This is a girl who just
wants to know who her family is,

00:17.060 --> 00:19.671
<i>who she's connected to.
Can you accept that part of it?</i>

00:19.671 --> 00:21.412
You want to go somewhere

00:21.412 --> 00:23.458
- and talk?
- Yeah.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.779
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:40.779 --> 00:42.868
Whoa!
Slow down, moron.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.348
You trying
to get somebody killed?

00:44.348 --> 00:45.480
I am sorry,

00:45.480 --> 00:47.134
I am so sorry.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.961
I was distracted.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.659
Please forgive me.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.095
Where's that accent from?

00:52.095 --> 00:55.316
Ukraine.
A town called Bezruky.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.057
Quiet village.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.362
Or, it was.

00:58.362 --> 00:59.711
Shame what's going on out there.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.452
Your village
get hit bad?

01:01.452 --> 01:04.107
We got some of the worst
shelling of the war.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.283
That's rough.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.503
Sorry you went
through that.

01:08.503 --> 01:12.159
Just keep your eyes on
the road, all right?

01:12.159 --> 01:14.161
Have a nice day.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.423
Thanks, Ukraine.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.077
You too.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.775
Hope L.A. treats you right.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.356
Oh!

01:35.356 --> 01:36.531
- Oh!
- Okay.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.359
Airmail city, baby.

01:38.359 --> 01:39.838
Boo, Rocker!

01:39.838 --> 01:41.710
How'd I make it look
so damn pretty?

01:41.710 --> 01:42.885
All right, you got that one
out your system.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.365
That was luck
right there.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.323
Hey, might be all she wrote
for 20-Squad.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.890
Yeah, little premature, Alfaro.
It ain't over yet.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.718
Yo, come on,
Hondo, you got this. Let's go.

01:49.718 --> 01:52.068
His boys got to get out my way.
- Give me my lane.
- Come on, back up.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.765
Come on, Hondo!

01:53.765 --> 01:55.376
- What'd I miss?
- Whole game, almost.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.029
Oh, thank God.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.770
50-Squad's up 18-15

01:58.770 --> 02:00.381
going into this round.
Rocker just hit a four-bagger.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.339
Come on, Hondo, keep us alive!

02:02.339 --> 02:03.688
- Let's go, baby.
- Let's go!

02:03.688 --> 02:05.908
- We got people placing bets now?
- Yeah.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.344
Remind me how this even started.

02:07.344 --> 02:08.867
- Cornhole?
- No, no, no.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.652
The squads competing
every year to get out of working

02:10.652 --> 02:12.567
the St. Paddy's Day parade--
- where'd that come from?
- Beats me,

02:12.567 --> 02:14.482
man. SWAT's been doing it
since my dad's days.

02:14.482 --> 02:15.744
Hondo puts this in

02:15.744 --> 02:17.224
or it's over. Hey.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.921
Hope you're paying
- attention, big boy.
- Mm.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.967
You're about to witness
greatness. Here we go!

02:24.796 --> 02:25.797
Oh!

02:25.797 --> 02:27.712
Boom!

02:27.712 --> 02:30.280
20-Squad stays alive! Yeah.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.761
50-Squad's up, 20 to 15.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.937
What say we
up the ante?

02:34.937 --> 02:35.590
Oh, here we go.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.026
Squad that loses

02:37.026 --> 02:38.593
covers the other squad's
parade assignments--

02:38.593 --> 02:40.334
all of them--

02:40.334 --> 02:42.074
the rest of the year.
No, no, no. Don't-don't do it,

02:42.074 --> 02:44.033
Hondo. No, they-they
got Fourth of July.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.426
We got Thanksgiving.
Go for it.

02:45.426 --> 02:47.515
So, what do you think?

02:47.515 --> 02:50.213
You know what?
You got yourself a deal.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.388
Attaboy, Rocker!

02:51.388 --> 02:52.781
Yeah.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.217
Should have looked
at the calendar, man.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.524
We also got the Christmas parade
this year, too.

02:58.656 --> 02:59.918
Game's over!

02:59.918 --> 03:01.050
Car bombing,

03:01.050 --> 03:04.358
49th and Everett.
20-Squad, showtime.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.665
Hey, everybody
- needs to move back.
- Get to the sidewalk.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.364
Everybody make space.
- Get 'em out.
- Back up, come on.

03:10.364 --> 03:11.800
Luca, get those cops
to move the perimeter back

03:11.800 --> 03:13.193
to preserve evidence.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.196
Okay. Bring it back,
at least 20 feet more.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.285
- It's not your average car bomb.
- You ain't lying.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.156
When's the last time
you saw a kick-out this size?

03:20.156 --> 03:22.811
Been a while. 20,
25-foot blast radius?

03:22.811 --> 03:24.813
Twenty-eight and a half.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.162
Vasquez.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.642
Got to tighten up your
response time. You boys

03:27.642 --> 03:29.600
- stop for take-out?
- Oh, okay.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.647
The FBI field office is,
what, three blocks away?

03:32.647 --> 03:34.649
- You get an ID on the victim?
- Not yet.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.216
The strength of the bomb blast
didn't, uh,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.827
leave much to work with.
Once our bomb tech

03:38.827 --> 03:40.829
says it's clear, we can get in,
recover dental records,

03:40.829 --> 03:42.831
VIN number,
but it's gonna take a while.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.267
Well, whoever did this
didn't just want him dead.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.529
This was a statement.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.009
FBI's theory, too. Our prelim

03:47.009 --> 03:49.881
swipe-test found chlorine
trifluoride on the frame.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.971
Extremely volatile compound,
highly corrosive.

03:52.971 --> 03:56.279
Turns ordinary explosives
into... well,

03:56.279 --> 03:57.672
- this.
- Hey, Vasquez.

03:57.672 --> 03:58.977
Yeah?

03:58.977 --> 04:00.196
Can we take a look
at that evidence?

04:00.196 --> 04:01.893
Yeah.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.983
Excuse me.
Hey, can I see that emblem?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.377
Thanks.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.988
This came off
the bumper.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.948
F.A.B.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.950
That's Faith Across Borders.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.301
It's a charitable organization
that helps refugees.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.260
I know one of the founders.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.479
Please tell me you have
his phone number.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.873
Well, I mean, if I did,
it's been ten or 15 years

04:24.873 --> 04:26.831
since I've called it.

04:33.185 --> 04:36.798
Hey. Hey, were you
nearby when it went off?

04:36.798 --> 04:39.931
Yeah. Talked to the driver
seconds before it happened.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.717
Poor guy was
a world away from home.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.066
Where'd he say home was?

04:44.066 --> 04:45.415
Ukraine.

04:45.415 --> 04:48.810
Yeah, looks like the war
followed him here.

04:48.810 --> 04:52.553
Line's disconnected. I'll
keep trying to contact him.

04:52.553 --> 04:55.077
- You said this guy's a preacher?
- He's a Catholic priest.

04:55.077 --> 04:58.036
I was in an accident way back,
and he was the chaplain

04:58.036 --> 05:00.561
at the hospital.
We grew close.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.389
Last I heard,
he was still involved

05:02.389 --> 05:04.913
with the organization.
If the victim was driving

05:04.913 --> 05:08.090
a F.A.B. car, then Father Dorner
knows who it is.

05:09.831 --> 05:13.095
FBI's been intercepting
chatter on the dark web.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.619
Russian extremist groups
intend to carry out attacks

05:15.619 --> 05:17.099
on Ukrainian refugees

05:17.099 --> 05:18.579
in the U.S.The threats get

05:18.579 --> 05:20.058
- any more specific?
- Yeah.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.756
A lot more specific.
A few sources

05:21.756 --> 05:24.236
have predicted
this M.O. with this

05:24.236 --> 05:25.673
explosive agent.
If the priest

05:25.673 --> 05:27.065
that you know
works with refugees

05:27.065 --> 05:29.154
and if our victim
turns out to be one,

05:29.154 --> 05:32.157
I'm gonna ask to pull SWAT into
a joint task force with us.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.898
You just said "attacks,"
as in multiple.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.944
Feds don't think
this bombing is a one-off?

05:35.944 --> 05:38.512
We fear this may be the first
in a series. Or worse,

05:38.512 --> 05:42.167
a practice run for something
much, much bigger. My bosses

05:42.167 --> 05:44.822
don't want to go wide with
the intel to avoid public panic.

05:44.822 --> 05:47.129
And I can't say that I agree,
but we don't know

05:47.129 --> 05:50.350
how credible
the intelligence is.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.004
I guess we do now.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.480
- I take it this is our victim?
- Yeah, Pavlo Koslov.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.482
He and his family
came from Ukraine two months ago

06:35.482 --> 06:37.048
through a Catholic
relief program called

06:37.048 --> 06:39.137
Faith Across Borders.
His wife,

06:39.137 --> 06:42.140
Boyka, and sons,
Maxim and Mykola, 19 and 20.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.446
From what we've learned,
the Koslovs

06:43.446 --> 06:44.882
are an extremely close family.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.318
Lucky they weren't
all in that car.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.755
Let's have 'em brought in

06:47.755 --> 06:49.496
- until our offender's in custody.
- We tried.

06:49.496 --> 06:52.368
We can't find them. We sent
agents to the parish dormitory

06:52.368 --> 06:55.502
housing refugee families.
Apparently, the Koslovs left

06:55.502 --> 06:57.025
after hearing
the news.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.331
Witnesses said they looked
distraught and scared.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.898
Probably worried
they'll be targeted next.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.334
Tough way to grieve.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.901
Why would
Russian extremists target

07:03.901 --> 07:06.426
- a Ukrainian barley farmer?
- A trial run, maybe.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.863
It's not uncommon for these
groups to road test explosives

07:08.863 --> 07:12.432
on a soft mark. A refugee like
Pavlo is as soft as they come.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.391
The Russian extremist forums
that we monitor

07:15.391 --> 07:18.481
are cheering the bombing
as a preview for what's to come.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.397
- Any group claim responsibility?
- Not yet. But chatter's

07:21.397 --> 07:23.051
picked up.
We think whoever is behind this

07:23.051 --> 07:25.183
is planning
a mass casualty event.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.359
Hey, gunman just hit
a chemical plant downtown.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.492
Shot a technician before
making off with 30 liters

07:29.492 --> 07:31.668
of the chemical
from our blast site.30 liters

07:31.668 --> 07:33.191
of chlorine trifluoride?

07:33.191 --> 07:35.019
Depending on
the mode of explosive,

07:35.019 --> 07:37.195
that-that's enough
to kill hundreds.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.545
You got anything more
on the gunman?

07:38.545 --> 07:40.503
No. Fled the scene
in a stolen Land Rover.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.636
I'm trying to contact the owner
so we can tap its nav system.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.812
Well, I'm heading to that plant
to see what else I can find.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.204
- Can I roll with?
- Yeah, go.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.250
This family's in danger.
I want 'em found.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.513
Any refugees willing to talk,
scoop them up too.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.906
We need to know
what they're running from

07:51.906 --> 07:52.863
if we're gonna prevent
another attack.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.212
Already on it.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.610
Father Dorner.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.570
Can't tell you how great it is
to see your face again.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.920
David.
Or should I say Sergeant?

08:05.920 --> 08:08.096
- You got silver around the edges.
- Yeah.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.793
Little more salt
than pepper now, yeah.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.578
- You're one to talk.
- Well, I went gray

08:11.578 --> 08:14.581
at 35. Working in a trauma wing
- will do that.
- Yeah. Listen, um,

08:14.581 --> 08:17.061
sorry we don't have more time
to catch up properly.

08:17.061 --> 08:20.108
And like I said on the phone,
- I'm sorry for Mr. Koslov.
- I didn't know him

08:20.108 --> 08:23.328
very long. Um, a few
phone calls arranging visas

08:23.328 --> 08:25.722
the couple months since they've
been living at the dormitory.

08:25.722 --> 08:28.769
Can you think of any reason why
someone would want to kill him?

08:28.769 --> 08:30.597
- Does a terrorist need a reason?
- Yeah.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.121
I heard Pavlo and his
wife Boyka were getting

08:33.121 --> 08:35.819
more involved with the Ukrainian
community here, the anti-war

08:35.819 --> 08:38.343
effort, but they weren't
exactly outspoken.

08:38.343 --> 08:41.521
So, if Pavlo's murder was a
test run for Russian extremists,

08:41.521 --> 08:43.610
there's a chance that
he may have crossed paths

08:43.610 --> 08:45.699
with someone that
chose him as a target.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.744
Is there anyone we should
talk to that knew his family--

08:47.744 --> 08:49.224
friends or neighbors?

08:49.224 --> 08:52.183
Oh, there is one girl,
another refugee. Uh, Oksana.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.968
She lives down the hall
in the dormitory.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.970
I think she and
Pavlo's wife were close,

08:55.970 --> 08:58.102
but you'd do better asking her.
Oksana Melnik.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.974
Okay. Oksana. Thank you.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.976
Look at this place.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
I am proud of you, David.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.154
A fulfilling job, a family
at home. It's amazing how far

09:06.154 --> 09:09.157
you've come since that angry
young man in a hospital bed.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.594
I really was angry, wasn't I?

09:11.594 --> 09:14.815
It's just that I was a
different person back then.

09:14.815 --> 09:18.383
Sometimes I wonder how
I even got here from there.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.168
I learned early on
as a chaplain--

09:20.168 --> 09:21.822
what's that old quote-- uh,

09:21.822 --> 09:25.869
"The most incredible thing about
miracles is that they happen."

09:25.869 --> 09:28.132
Hmm.

09:33.747 --> 09:37.141
What up, Durant? [laughs][laughs] When are you gonna...

09:37.141 --> 09:39.143
When you gonna
start calling me Eva?

09:39.143 --> 09:41.319
Aw, I never
had a sister to tease,

09:41.319 --> 09:43.278
so I got a few years
to make up for.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.194
Look, I know you guys
are swamped with this bombing,

09:46.194 --> 09:47.674
so if you want to do this
at another time...

09:47.674 --> 09:48.849
No. No, no.

09:48.849 --> 09:49.893
I can still make a quick intro,

09:49.893 --> 09:50.981
I just can't stay.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.331
Terry's parking now.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.638
Saw the cornhole boards
- out there.
- Yeah.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.249
I hear 20-Squad and 50-Squad
are locked in a battle.

09:58.249 --> 10:00.861
- Heck yeah.
- Patrol wanted in on the action.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.384
Our pot's up to 600 bucks.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.038
Oh, you're kidding.
You place a bet?

10:04.038 --> 10:05.430
Yeah, I might have
thrown some cash in.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.476
I hear Rocker's
pretty damn good.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.043
Oh, no! 50-squad?

10:09.043 --> 10:11.872
You put your money on the enemy?
Where's the loyalty, Durant?

10:11.872 --> 10:13.264
What kind of sister are you?

10:13.264 --> 10:17.573
Half. Or so
she says.

10:17.573 --> 10:20.010
Terry, meet our sister,
Eva Durant.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.795
Hi.

10:21.795 --> 10:25.363
I'm sorry, "So she says?"
You don't think we're related?

10:25.363 --> 10:27.148
All right.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.584
I didn't think I was
gonna have to do this.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.586
I only brought it in case
you guys wanted it.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.893
You decide
if it's ever the right time

10:32.893 --> 10:34.590
- to tell your dad.
- What is it?

10:34.590 --> 10:36.636
It's a paternity test.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.942
Proving Carl Luca's my father.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.250
Lawyers unsealed
my mom's will last week.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.948
Apparently she tested him
without him even knowing.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.689
By what, going
through his trash?

10:46.689 --> 10:49.387
You know, I have no idea,
but she was a cop.

10:49.387 --> 10:50.824
And I guess she
wanted me to know after all.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.216
You don't
have to prove anything.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.175
What are you doing, bro?
I already explained

10:54.175 --> 10:56.090
everything on the phone.
If you weren't ready to do this,

10:56.090 --> 10:57.613
- we didn't have to meet.
- This is not news

10:57.613 --> 10:59.789
to me, man-- I've known
about her for three years.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.749
- What are you talking about?
- Wha... H-How?
I-I just found out weeks ago.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.315
Remember that time

11:04.315 --> 11:05.839
that I was getting back
on my feet and I was staying

11:05.839 --> 11:08.450
with Mom and Dad for
a little while? Well, her mom

11:08.450 --> 11:11.061
shows up on the doorstep
with that piece of paper.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.194
Thank God Mom and Dad
were out of town.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.196
Three years--
that must have been

11:15.196 --> 11:16.850
when my mom
found out she was sick.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.852
I wouldn't know.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.723
Conversation didn't last
very long. I don't know

11:20.723 --> 11:24.074
if she was there for an apology,
whether she wanted money...

11:25.423 --> 11:26.642
I was not gonna let her ruin
Mom and Dad's

11:26.642 --> 11:28.165
twilight years,
and I'm not gonna

11:28.165 --> 11:31.516
let you do it now, so...

11:32.387 --> 11:36.130
Well, that's, um...
that's not at all what I want.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.784
Yeah, sure.

11:37.784 --> 11:38.959
Okay, this was a mistake.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.134
Yep.

11:40.134 --> 11:43.354
All of it.
Sorry I ever reached out.

11:43.354 --> 11:47.445
Wait. Durant. Eva. Ev... Bye. Thanks.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.797
Why would you
treat her like that?

11:50.797 --> 11:53.277
How could you not tell me
we had a baby sister?

11:53.277 --> 11:56.150
If you want to air out
Dad's dirty laundry, go ahead.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.152
Be my guest.
Give him a c...

11:58.152 --> 12:01.068
Even better,
why don't you give Mom a call?

12:01.068 --> 12:02.678
Maybe it'll go down
a little easier

12:02.678 --> 12:04.506
coming from
the family's golden boy.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.987
Eva just wanted to feel
like part of a family.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.163
- So?
- Okay?

12:09.163 --> 12:10.904
I should have warned her
out messed-up ours is

12:10.904 --> 12:12.993
and I should have told her
who you really are.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.777
Oh. Who am I?Yeah.

12:14.777 --> 12:15.996
- Truth?
- Yeah.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.301
You're a deadbeat.

12:17.301 --> 12:19.303
You're a deadbeat
hell-bent on

12:19.303 --> 12:21.001
tearing down anyone
happier than you, Terry.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.263
Which is everyone.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.526
I only hung out
with Durant

12:24.526 --> 12:26.441
a few times.
I feel closer to her

12:26.441 --> 12:28.356
than I ever did
with my loser brother.

12:28.356 --> 12:31.315
Man, screw you.
- Screw this whole damn family.
- Screw you, too, Terry.

12:31.315 --> 12:34.057
I don't even know
why I try anymore.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.760
Just heard Tan got something
off a security tape

12:40.760 --> 12:42.544
- from the chemical plant?
- Bomber placed a call

12:42.544 --> 12:44.633
in Russian as he stole the
chemical-- translated to

12:44.633 --> 12:46.678
"it's enough to
kill them all."Kill them all?

12:46.678 --> 12:48.376
Sounds like they got
something bigger planned.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.812
This is what I don't get.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.380
Russian operations are known
for being prepared.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.208
This looks more like
a guy improvising

12:54.208 --> 12:56.210
on the fly. Any luck
tracking the Land Rover?

12:56.210 --> 12:58.473
No, no dice.
Nav system's been disabled.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.257
Luca's trying
to find a work-around.

13:00.257 --> 13:02.216
Hey, remind me the name
of the refugee girl

13:02.216 --> 13:03.695
- we're talking to.
- Oksana.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.959
Father Dorner thinks that
she might have an idea

13:05.959 --> 13:07.525
where the Koslovs
are hiding out.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.962
Seeing him again today must have
stirred up some memories.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.399
- You holding up okay?
- Yeah, sure.

13:17.666 --> 13:21.539
Oksana, I'm Sergeant Harrelson,
this is Sergeant Kay.

13:21.539 --> 13:22.889
We'd like to ask you
a few questions

13:22.889 --> 13:24.586
- about the Koslov family.
- We hear you've been

13:24.586 --> 13:26.240
spending time down the hall
at their place,

13:26.240 --> 13:28.764
that-that you and Mrs. Koslov
are close--

13:28.764 --> 13:30.461
as in, friends.

13:30.461 --> 13:33.247
Yes, Boyka teaches
me to cook.

13:33.247 --> 13:36.598
My mother-- she...

13:37.381 --> 13:38.905
...she died in the war.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.515
I'm really sorry to hear that.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.778
Boyka's husband,
her sons--

13:42.778 --> 13:44.519
outside of the building
where we live--

13:44.519 --> 13:46.869
- I do not really know them.
- Do you have any idea

13:46.869 --> 13:48.436
where they may have gone
once they heard the news

13:48.436 --> 13:50.873
about Mr. Koslov?
Did you ever overhear them

13:50.873 --> 13:52.266
discuss fearing for their lives?

13:52.266 --> 13:54.268
We are refugees.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.096
We all live in fear.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.228
Is why we
left Ukraine.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.230
I used to lie in bed
at night and wait

14:00.230 --> 14:02.232
for shell to drop through roof.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.669
To wonder if I
will not wake up.

14:04.669 --> 14:07.411
I can't imagine experiencing
that as a 16-year-old.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.545
My father thought
America was safe.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.025
But after what happen
to Mr. Koslov,

14:12.025 --> 14:15.028
he thinks we made a
mistake in coming here.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.246
But where else would we go?

14:16.246 --> 14:18.727
When did you last
see the Koslovs?

14:18.727 --> 14:21.034
Last night.
I did not stay long.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.383
Just to borrow some milk.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.950
How'd the family
seem to you?

14:23.950 --> 14:26.039
Did you notice anything unusual?

14:26.039 --> 14:28.650
My father says
- it is just my imagination.
- Well, now

14:28.650 --> 14:30.739
is the time to share, because
whoever bombed Mr. Koslov

14:30.739 --> 14:34.134
will do it again.
And a lot more people next time.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.223
To me, the whole
family seem nervous.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.573
Like when you
lie and wait for a shell.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.967
Like something is coming.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.273
But this is just
- what I think.
- Hey.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.971
Need you guys out here.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.711
Excuse us.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.542
Got a lead
- on the stolen Land Rover.
- How? I thought you said

14:51.542 --> 14:53.327
- they disabled the Nav system.
- They did, but I talked

14:53.327 --> 14:55.851
to the car's owner, okay? He
left his gym bag in the trunk.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.636
Had these fancy new earbuds
inside, they were complete

14:58.636 --> 15:00.769
- with tracking technology.
- Did you ping the earbuds?

15:00.769 --> 15:03.119
CHP pulled them from a pile
of trash near an off-ramp.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.773
I thought it was
a dead end, right?

15:04.773 --> 15:06.862
But the data shows that the
earbuds were stationary for

15:06.862 --> 15:09.996
two hours earlier, just outside
of a building at 12th and Olive.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.998
Right, that's less than a mile
from where Tan and Vasquez are.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.782
- Yep.
- Did you tell them to head
to this place?

15:13.782 --> 15:15.305
They're landing now.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.181
How far out's your team?

15:21.181 --> 15:23.531
12 minutes. Yours?

15:23.531 --> 15:26.012
Ten. But knowing Luca,
they'll be here in eight.

15:26.012 --> 15:29.537
Hey, Tan, the chemical
needs to be handled

15:29.537 --> 15:30.930
at low temps.
An A/C room

15:30.930 --> 15:32.932
would be the perfect place
to build explosives.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.218
- Vasquez.
- Yeah?

15:58.218 --> 16:01.047
Label on that
case says CLF3.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.745
Chlorine trifluoride.
Both canisters are gone.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.401
Industrial-sized

16:07.401 --> 16:09.272
pressure cookers.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.538
They're gone, too.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.758
Two bombs already made.

16:20.631 --> 16:21.763
LAPD. Stop right there!

16:21.763 --> 16:24.331
FBI. Put your hands up!

16:46.657 --> 16:49.008
Give me your hands!
Hands behind your back!

16:56.493 --> 16:57.929
It's Boyka Koslov.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.409
Pavlo's widow?

17:03.457 --> 17:04.806
Yeah, it's her.

17:04.806 --> 17:05.981
No doubt about it.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.287
You're too late.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.853
We got what we want.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.551
You will all pay.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.645
So the family we were worrying
about-- not a family at all.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.081
Not Ukrainian refugees, either.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.649
We got a match on her prints.
She belongs to a group

17:21.649 --> 17:23.390
of Russian terrorists.
Embedded themselves

17:23.390 --> 17:25.218
into the Ukrainian
community to attack

17:25.218 --> 17:27.524
- from within.
- So the man posing
as the father,

17:27.524 --> 17:29.570
what, blew himself
up by accident?

17:29.570 --> 17:31.789
Chlorine trifluoride
combusts on its own

17:31.789 --> 17:34.009
if mishandled. Which explains
why we didn't find a detonator

17:34.009 --> 17:37.012
among the wreckage.
If he hit a speed bump

17:37.012 --> 17:38.840
at a bad angle-- kaboom.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.668
Woman's real name
is Uma Petrova.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.323
She bombed a refugee camp
in Warsaw last year.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.499
Posed as a cook,
blew up their mess hall.

17:45.499 --> 17:46.761
What about her other
two comrades?

17:46.761 --> 17:49.155
Dmitri Enten and
Lev Gorki. All four

17:49.155 --> 17:51.026
belong to a terrorist
faction called Victory Force.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.854
They're hard-core
ultra-nationalists

17:52.854 --> 17:55.378
who want
an ethnically pure society,

17:55.378 --> 17:57.337
free of foreign influence.
A new USSR.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.426
Oh, great,
just what the world needs.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.644
- Yeah.
- Now, Interpol

18:00.644 --> 18:02.168
thinks these two
run the operation.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.039
They were gone when
we got there, but they built

18:04.039 --> 18:05.562
- two bombs.
- You put chlorine trifluoride

18:05.562 --> 18:07.390
in one of those and
detonate it in public?

18:07.390 --> 18:10.045
Yeah, three-digit death toll of
the Mumbai train bombings with

18:10.045 --> 18:11.699
round-the-clock coverage
of the Boston Marathon's.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.136
The bonfire she started
in that oil drum--

18:14.136 --> 18:16.921
FBI agents just extracted
a melted hard drive from it.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.706
Do they think
they can salvage it?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.708
We'll find out. It's
on its way to forensics lab.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.753
The woman you picked up,
uh Boyka, Uma--

18:22.753 --> 18:24.103
whatever the hell
her name is--

18:24.103 --> 18:25.887
has anybody taken
a crack at her?

18:25.887 --> 18:28.716
Not yet. Agents are coming to
take her into federal custody.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.718
With a racial zealot
like this, they usually

18:30.718 --> 18:32.415
- want the first shot.
- Well, it's a good thing

18:32.415 --> 18:34.113
we didn't ask for permission.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.776
I see you heard the news.

18:45.776 --> 18:49.128
I'm the reason this so-called
family got into the country.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.347
A Ukrainian farmer
calls us out of the blue,

18:51.347 --> 18:54.437
says, uh, his-his land's been
shelled and his family has

18:54.437 --> 18:57.701
- nowhere to go.
- Father Dorner, it's
not your fault.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.921
They would have found
some other way in.

19:01.879 --> 19:05.883
FBI's ready to speak again,
Father. He'll walk you over.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.933
That guilt
you carried--

19:11.933 --> 19:14.370
how often do you
still think about Keith?

19:15.328 --> 19:18.418
Well, for a long time,
I prayed for him every day.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.507
Lately...

19:20.507 --> 19:22.639
I couldn't say.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.735
- He's taking it pretty hard.
- Yeah.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.956
What'd he mean
by "the guilt you carry"?

19:39.787 --> 19:41.963
I wasn't the greatest guy at 21.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.967
I drank a lot, fought a lot,

19:45.967 --> 19:49.275
couldn't keep a girl.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.972
My buddy, Keith...

19:51.799 --> 19:54.149
...he had everything
going for him.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.935
He didn't even want
to go to Vegas that weekend.

19:57.935 --> 20:02.157
But I had to see this band.
Neither one of us wanted

20:02.157 --> 20:03.637
to drive back to L.A.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.334
I had this construction job
in the morning,

20:05.334 --> 20:08.163
so I convinced him to drive.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.513
Almost home, 4:00 a.m.,

20:10.513 --> 20:12.211
I fell asleep.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.692
I guess Keith did, too.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.915
I woke up in the ICU

20:20.915 --> 20:23.178
with a chaplain
holding my hand...

20:24.266 --> 20:27.748
...giving me the news
that my friend was gone.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.490
Well, it's good thing
Father Dorner was there

20:30.490 --> 20:31.839
to help you through.

20:31.839 --> 20:34.494
Yeah. He's a good man.
He listened to me

20:34.494 --> 20:36.322
curse out God for-for

20:36.322 --> 20:38.498
taking Keith instead of me.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.326
And...

20:40.326 --> 20:42.197
I said, "Well, I might
be swearing at Him, but at least

20:42.197 --> 20:44.808
I'm-I'm talking to Him
for the first time in my life."

20:45.809 --> 20:47.985
And Father Dorner
looked at me and he said,

20:47.985 --> 20:50.423
"Well, that's a start."

20:52.338 --> 20:53.817
It's funny how that works,

20:53.817 --> 20:56.733
someone finding you when
you need 'em the most.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.692
Having someone like that

20:58.692 --> 21:01.782
there for me, at that moment...

21:01.782 --> 21:03.871
He's the only reason I made it.

21:03.871 --> 21:07.091
He's why I am who I am.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.531
As hard as it is to say...

21:11.531 --> 21:14.142
that accident
put my life on track.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.665
Gave me my faith.

21:15.665 --> 21:19.016
Made me worthy of a woman
like Annie, of my kids.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.715
What if that tragedy
had never happened?

21:21.715 --> 21:23.194
What do you mean?

21:23.194 --> 21:24.848
Keith dying.

21:26.415 --> 21:30.332
That's-that's the reason why
I have everything that I have.

21:42.823 --> 21:45.260
We know who you are.

21:45.260 --> 21:48.089
We know about your terrorist
cabal, Victory Force.

21:48.089 --> 21:51.353
If I really am some
important terrorist,

21:51.353 --> 21:53.224
they wouldn't send two...

21:54.443 --> 21:56.837
...whatever the two of you are.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.014
Sorry, but this
is as white as this room's

22:00.014 --> 22:01.494
gonna get for you right now.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.147
I read up

22:03.147 --> 22:06.020
on this extremist
group of yours.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.891
How you like
to play the long game,

22:07.891 --> 22:10.416
blend in with your victims
before you strike.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.156
Someone like you

22:12.156 --> 22:14.507
does not understand
the discipline it takes

22:14.507 --> 22:18.598
to live each day in different
skin, so the people you despise

22:18.598 --> 22:21.514
will take you in as one of them.

22:21.514 --> 22:24.430
To just "blow people up"

22:24.430 --> 22:25.822
will not do.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.564
It must be right people,
at right time.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.958
You're talking about
innocent lives.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.439
In war, no one is innocent.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.615
You wouldn't understand.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.225
Neither of you knows war.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.314
Well, I'm not sure you know
who you're speaking to.

22:39.314 --> 22:40.663
Well, Black teenagers

22:40.663 --> 22:41.969
doing drive-by shooting does not

22:41.969 --> 22:43.405
- count as war.
- And neither does planting

22:43.405 --> 22:45.625
pressure cooker bombs
in a crowd.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.105
I've seen plenty of war, lady.

22:48.105 --> 22:51.413
Real war. Street war.
And enough to know that

22:51.413 --> 22:53.850
what you're talking about
is something diabolical.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.765
Something cowardly.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.419
The two men
that are still

22:57.419 --> 22:58.812
out there--
give us their targets.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.117
Lives can still be saved.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.032
The enemy does not
deserve to be saved!

23:02.032 --> 23:05.166
The West interferes
in Russian affairs too long.

23:05.166 --> 23:08.256
The U.S. is a nation
of degenerate mongrels.

23:08.256 --> 23:11.912
It is Ukraine who drank
American poison infecting us.

23:11.912 --> 23:14.828
So we will stop infection

23:14.828 --> 23:17.483
and create
a new day of victory

23:17.483 --> 23:21.400
for all the world to see.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.502
Guessing this is the work
of this Victory Force group?

23:36.502 --> 23:38.721
Yeah, last May they bombed
a ferry full of refugees

23:38.721 --> 23:41.289
on the Black Sea.
They spent, like, a week

23:41.289 --> 23:43.378
working in the galley
beforehand, doing surveillance

23:43.378 --> 23:45.206
while they rigged
- the ship to blow.
- And speaking of surveillance,

23:45.206 --> 23:48.644
Forensics just sent over every
file they could extract from

23:48.644 --> 23:50.211
our suspects' hard drive.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.866
Thousands of photos that we need
to go through, one by one.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.697
These pictures are all of
Eastern Europe. This is prep

23:57.697 --> 23:59.568
for their past attacks,
not what they're planning

23:59.568 --> 24:00.874
in L.A.-- this isn't
gonna help much.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.223
You never know, man.
She wanted

24:02.223 --> 24:03.790
to torch the hard drive
for a reason.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.661
Hey, I thought
I saw your brother

24:05.661 --> 24:07.097
walking out of here earlier.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.186
I've never seen Terry upset
like that. You two cool?

24:09.186 --> 24:11.188
Yeah, no. I'm fine.
Terry's Terry.

24:11.188 --> 24:12.538
Something to do with
a half-sister

24:12.538 --> 24:14.278
that just
- came out of the woodwork?
- Look,

24:14.278 --> 24:16.150
ask Terry. He's known
about her for three years.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.891
He reads her the riot act,
and for what--

24:17.891 --> 24:20.720
to defend the parents he's been
at odds with his whole life?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.373
Please.
It took me, like,

24:22.373 --> 24:24.811
two hours to welcome Eva
as a sister.

24:24.811 --> 24:27.030
He's kept this secret
for three years?

24:27.030 --> 24:28.423
And he comes in that hot?
I mean,

24:28.423 --> 24:30.294
- what the hell's wrong with him?
- I can't begin

24:30.294 --> 24:32.906
to understand the shock
of meeting a new sibling.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.864
But I do know what it's like
to be a younger brother

24:34.864 --> 24:37.606
to someone I admire.
Terry keeping it a secret,

24:37.606 --> 24:39.521
trying to defend your family--

24:39.521 --> 24:42.437
maybe he was just doing
what he thought you would do.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.226
No, I'm not hanging on
the line while you ponder

24:49.226 --> 24:52.316
who's got a lighter touch
with a damn beanbag, Jack.

24:52.316 --> 24:55.537
Aren't you missing an early
bird special somewhere?

24:55.537 --> 24:57.452
Yeah, a-all right.
Yeah, sure.

24:57.452 --> 24:59.236
Unbelievable.

24:59.236 --> 25:01.456
What happened-- Mumford get
wind of our cornhole contest?

25:01.456 --> 25:02.762
You believe that guy?

25:02.762 --> 25:04.459
Calling me
about a bar game

25:04.459 --> 25:06.243
on a day like today?

25:06.243 --> 25:07.593
He trying to get you
to lay a side bet?

25:07.593 --> 25:09.290
The man who used to
put money on which rookie

25:09.290 --> 25:10.944
would finish a burger first?
Yeah, he tried.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.947
I don't have time
- for that crap anymore.
- Come on, Commander.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.557
How much he get you
to bet on me?

25:15.557 --> 25:18.560
Well... let's just say
you better not lose.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.388
I got this.

25:20.388 --> 25:21.781
Anyway, I just
came to tell you that

25:21.781 --> 25:23.696
that Russian she-wolf
we interrogated--

25:23.696 --> 25:26.176
she's on her way
- to federal lock-up.
- Good. Good riddance.

25:26.176 --> 25:27.656
I think we might have found
the bombers' target.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.702
They surveilled a building
in L.A.-- look at this pic.

25:29.702 --> 25:33.749
No idea where it is, but that's
an L.A. city bus in front.

25:33.749 --> 25:34.968
I know I've driven by that gate.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.360
I count a couple
of Ukrainian flags

25:36.360 --> 25:38.406
in that group.
Are those people tourists?

25:38.406 --> 25:39.625
Wait a minute.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.540
Look at the reflection
in the bus window.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.498
That building-- that's
on Vermont Avenue.

25:43.498 --> 25:46.327
- That's the Ukrainian consulate.
- The consulate's their target.

25:46.327 --> 25:49.025
I'll tell the Bureau and have
50-Squad meet you there.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.510
FBI's docked in front.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.773
They're steering the evacuation
with consulate security.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.166
Bomb squad
is sniffing the building.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.689
Tan, show 'em who
we're looking for.

26:00.689 --> 26:03.300
Dmitri Enten and Lev Gorki.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.694
- Get a look at their faces, boys.
- Couple a beauties.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.043
All right, they're probably
here as kitchen staff

26:07.043 --> 26:08.436
to sneak pressure cookers in.

26:08.436 --> 26:11.047
Food service trucks,
delivery vans. We need eyes

26:11.047 --> 26:12.658
on every person
near those vehicles.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.137
- Split and search.
- Hey,

26:14.137 --> 26:16.531
leave your vehicles behind
and move that way.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.011
- Go, go.
- No one

26:18.011 --> 26:19.360
goes near the building.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.840
Get away from
the building.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.711
- Move, move.
- Move!

26:23.712 --> 26:24.713
Deacon.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.715
Hey. Hey!

26:26.715 --> 26:28.630
Suspect's taking off!

26:35.245 --> 26:37.160
Luca, carefully.
Could be a bomb.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.901
It's kitchen equipment.
No explosives.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.425
Who are you?
Who do you work for?

26:41.425 --> 26:43.950
- Uh, Alameda Meats.
- Why you running from the cops?

26:43.950 --> 26:45.125
I-I have a warrant.
I skipped my court date.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.561
That's all, I-I swear.

26:47.823 --> 26:50.652
Come on. Get up, get
up, get out of here.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.698
Out towards the street.
- Go, go.
- Bomb squad

26:52.698 --> 26:54.395
- find anything inside?
- Still sweeping.

26:54.395 --> 26:57.050
So far, nothing.
No sign of our suspects either.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.399
Well, maybe they got spooked.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.662
Think about it.
Their friend blows himself up,

27:00.662 --> 27:03.360
they make backup explosives,
realize we're onto 'em.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.493
- Maybe they changed course.
- Well, those bombs
are gonna explode

27:05.493 --> 27:07.016
whether they have
a plan B or not.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.410
They stole
chlorine trifluoride from

27:09.410 --> 27:10.977
a highly-controlled
lab environment.

27:10.977 --> 27:12.761
In a pressure cooker
made of stainless steel,

27:12.761 --> 27:15.242
the chemical's shelf life
is extremely limited.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.026
How long we got
- before they blow?
- One,

27:17.026 --> 27:18.767
maybe two hours, tops.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.116
Our suspects have to find

27:20.116 --> 27:21.596
another target, fast.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.554
Then we're running out
of time to find 'em.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.258
Vasquez talk
to the FBI chem lab?

27:31.258 --> 27:32.651
They confirmed that the
chlorine trifluoride

27:32.651 --> 27:35.915
will only hold up another
90 minutes, if that.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.960
Wait, so if we don't find
these bombers and somehow

27:37.960 --> 27:40.659
get this chemical back in
a lab-controlled environment... Fireworks.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.182
Hondo and I just
got off the phone

27:42.182 --> 27:43.836
with the Ukrainian
consul general.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.576
Tan, I need to
take another look

27:45.576 --> 27:46.926
at the bombers' surveillance
of the consulate.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.710
Thought these guys
changed course.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.799
- Isn't the consulate a dead end?
- Not necessarily.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.714
This photo was taken
two weeks ago today.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.020
Consul general just gave us

27:54.020 --> 27:56.370
a list of everyone
who toured that day. And on it

27:56.370 --> 27:59.199
was one of our
suspect's aliases.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.157
There. I recognize
that girl's tattoo.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.029
Who's that?

28:03.029 --> 28:05.422
It's Oksana Melnik. Teenage
refugee, lives down the hall

28:05.422 --> 28:06.859
from our suspects.
Same girl who said that

28:06.859 --> 28:08.730
- she didn't really know them.
- So why's she

28:08.730 --> 28:11.428
all the way across town in a
photo one of our bombers took?

28:11.428 --> 28:12.865
Well, we're about to find out.
She's still around.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.041
Commander and Vasquez
are gonna want to

28:15.041 --> 28:16.433
take the next run at her.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.131
We know

28:18.131 --> 28:20.307
that you toured the
consulate to provide cover

28:20.307 --> 28:23.440
while our suspect
surveilled the building.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.877
The way we see it,

28:24.877 --> 28:27.096
you're probably a
Russian imposter,

28:27.096 --> 28:29.577
- same as them.
- Never.

28:29.577 --> 28:32.449
I would bleed for Ukraine.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.888
His real name is Dmitri?

28:35.888 --> 28:40.066
He's so quiet, always indoors,
spending time with family.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.502
Two of you had a relationship.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.025
It was a secret.

28:43.025 --> 28:47.464
Okay? He said we cannot
tell anyone until I am 18,

28:47.464 --> 28:49.684
but now I know
he is Russian terrorist.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.991
He never loved me.
Nothing he said

28:51.991 --> 28:55.821
was true. I would
kill him myself if I could.

28:56.691 --> 29:00.086
Besides your consulate tour,
did Dmitri photograph

29:00.086 --> 29:01.652
other places you know of?

29:01.652 --> 29:04.438
I do not know
what he was doing. I just...

29:04.438 --> 29:06.745
I thought he liked
taking pictures.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.616
Looking back on that day,
I think he just

29:08.616 --> 29:10.400
wanted to blend in
with the choir.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.968
- Choir-- what choir?
- My Ukrainian folk choir.

29:12.968 --> 29:15.449
We performed
at consulate that day.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.277
And so Dmitri was just
there taking pictures

29:17.277 --> 29:19.453
and no one
found that weird?

29:19.453 --> 29:22.195
Why would they?
He came to every rehearsal.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.110
He said

29:24.110 --> 29:25.720
he liked to hear me sing.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.767
Truth is, he just

29:28.767 --> 29:30.856
wandered around the church
with his camera.

29:30.856 --> 29:34.468
He took pictures
- of the church?
- Y-Yes. I think so.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.296
Where does your choir
rehearse, Oksana?

29:36.296 --> 29:38.472
Saint Michael's
Ukrainian Church--

29:38.472 --> 29:40.648
- it is on Adams Street.
- If the bombers

29:40.648 --> 29:43.564
are putting together their plan
on the fly, they're gonna stick

29:43.564 --> 29:46.480
to the targets they already
canvassed, like that church.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.742
Yeah.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.266
Straight to
voice mail.

29:50.266 --> 29:53.269
Saint Michael's
Holy Ukrainian Church.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.836
Please join us this afternoon

29:54.836 --> 29:57.621
for a peace vigil and reception
honoring those working

29:57.621 --> 29:59.841
to bring peace to Ukraine,
as we...

29:59.841 --> 30:02.670
Let's go. You hitch
- a ride with 20-Squad.
- Yeah.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.556
Can I help you?

30:19.556 --> 30:21.384
We have the food order
for the reception.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.690
I thought
it was a potluck.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.692
- Was there a change in plans?
- Yes.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.563
Something like that.

30:28.478 --> 30:29.566
I know you.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.264
Yes, I've seen you
with the choir.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.874
Oksana's friend?

30:32.874 --> 30:35.529
Come in.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.139
We'll set up
in banquet area, yes?

30:37.139 --> 30:38.445
You know where it is?

30:38.445 --> 30:39.881
Just down the stairs,
under the church.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.578
Yes.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.544
All right, my team's
a few miles behind us.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.111
Bomb squad's on their tail.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.287
- Tell your guys to take Monroe.
- Will do.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.420
I'll have FBI agents blocking
every street feeding the church.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.726
No escape route for these guys.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.206
How far out are we, Luca?

31:00.206 --> 31:02.817
- Three miles.
- All right, cut the siren
on approach.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.340
We go in stealth.
We don't need our suspects

31:04.340 --> 31:06.429
getting trigger-happy
if they hear us coming.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.214
You got it, boss.

31:09.084 --> 31:12.435
Hello?
Is there anyone down here?

31:21.749 --> 31:23.359
LAPD! Stay away
from the church.

31:23.359 --> 31:24.491
We need
a perimeter here.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.753
Clear the area
as fast as you can.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.102
You guys go, get people out.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.582
Vasquez, with me.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.890
LAPD!

31:31.890 --> 31:33.456
We need you to
exit the church.

31:33.456 --> 31:34.588
Move. Move.

31:34.588 --> 31:35.589
Let's go. Out of the church.

31:35.589 --> 31:36.503
Stay calm.

31:38.548 --> 31:39.767
What is that?

31:41.290 --> 31:42.596
- Good job.
- Out the front.

31:42.596 --> 31:43.945
Everyone go, go, go, go.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.425
Come on, keep moving,
keep moving.

31:45.425 --> 31:46.687
Everybody out the
front, let's go.

31:46.687 --> 31:49.124
Hey, I've got
movement downstairs.

31:49.124 --> 31:50.212
I'm gonna go check it out.

31:50.212 --> 31:51.257
Roger.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.301
People are almost evacuated.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.650
We're clearing the alter.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.180
Bomb in the sanctuary.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.616
Less than three minutes
on the timer.

32:02.616 --> 32:05.488
Roger. FBI bomb squad
just landed, coming in

32:05.488 --> 32:07.099
through the front.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.757
I got eyes on a second
armed explosive.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.890
There's a hostage
bound in the corner.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.587
Downstairs
banquet room.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.198
Are you okay?

32:26.857 --> 32:28.381
I know you're back there.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.905
Why don't you put the gun
down and step on out.

32:30.905 --> 32:32.820
Today, the world sees
what happens to infidels

32:32.820 --> 32:34.996
and mongrels. And to
nations that meddle.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.737
Listen to me.
We can all walk out of here

32:36.737 --> 32:37.956
if you disarm that thing.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.740
This can end peacefully.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.569
No.
I'm afraid it cannot.

32:48.314 --> 32:49.489
Being a martyr
wasn't part of your plan.

32:49.489 --> 32:50.490
You don't want to do this.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.492
Is not about want.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.015
It is about duty.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.017
Is duty
of every true Russian

32:56.017 --> 32:58.541
to destroy her enemies
like rabid dogs.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.891
And the West is diseased!

33:04.765 --> 33:07.028
You guys might want
to get out of here.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.725
Any sort of contact
with these lid clamps

33:08.725 --> 33:10.118
might trigger the device.

33:10.118 --> 33:13.252
This sort of timer
can be reprogrammed with

33:13.252 --> 33:14.775
a four-digit
code. I got

33:14.775 --> 33:18.083
a codebreaker right here.

33:18.083 --> 33:21.564
Hey, getting
a little close there, pal.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.135
I hear something
in the kitchen.

33:27.135 --> 33:30.008
It's your last chance
to get out alive.

33:30.965 --> 33:31.966
Cover!

33:33.924 --> 33:36.057
Vasquez, get to the back.

33:36.057 --> 33:39.191
I have plenty of ammo.

33:44.413 --> 33:45.675
Here.

33:46.763 --> 33:48.852
- Now, Vasquez.
- FBI!

33:52.421 --> 33:53.857
Suspect down.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.646
Deac, you copy?

34:01.474 --> 34:03.084
Deacon.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.535
Hey, you okay?

34:19.535 --> 34:21.015
- Yeah, can you get up?
- Mm-hmm.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.234
All right. I need to you
to get out of the church

34:22.234 --> 34:23.365
and go as far as you can.

34:23.365 --> 34:25.585
Go, go, go.
30-David.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.108
Hostage is on her way
out to you.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.979
Second suspect in custody.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.984
All right.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.683
How do I disarm this thing?

34:36.683 --> 34:37.945
Okay, the bombers set

34:37.945 --> 34:39.164
a four-digit code that stops

34:39.164 --> 34:40.556
the timer.
Haven't found it yet.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.167
Think, think. The group's

34:42.167 --> 34:44.343
called Victory Force.
They're about racial purity,

34:44.343 --> 34:45.909
defeating enemies.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.955
Do Russians have any
lucky numbers that relate?

34:47.955 --> 34:49.348
Is there some year
that's important to them?

34:49.348 --> 34:50.610
Uh, a patriotic date, maybe?

34:50.610 --> 34:51.959
What'd the suspect
we interrogated

34:51.959 --> 34:53.613
say about a day
of reckoning?

34:53.613 --> 34:55.702
Said they wanted to create a day
of victory for the world to see.

34:55.702 --> 34:58.052
Russia has
an actual Victory Day, right?

34:58.052 --> 35:00.228
- Does anyone know the date?
- Yeah, I think it's in

35:00.228 --> 35:01.621
- May.
- May 9th.

35:01.621 --> 35:03.275
The ferry they
blew up on the Black Sea

35:03.275 --> 35:05.103
last spring, okay-- that
was on Victory Day.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.626
- May 9th.
- Oh-five,

35:06.626 --> 35:09.019
oh-nine. No go.

35:09.846 --> 35:10.847
Do day,

35:10.847 --> 35:11.935
then month,

35:11.935 --> 35:13.154
European style.

35:13.154 --> 35:16.723
0-9-0-5.

35:19.508 --> 35:20.944
That's it.

35:20.944 --> 35:22.642
- It worked.
- It worked.

35:22.642 --> 35:24.122
Secured.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.130
I hate bombs.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.569
So, I hear you
got to finish some big

35:36.569 --> 35:38.614
cornhole match
when you get back?

35:38.614 --> 35:39.833
Don't tell me
you bet on it.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.269
How dumb do I look?

35:41.269 --> 35:42.401
You gonna win?

35:42.401 --> 35:44.403
Oh, who knows.
Rocker's been putting in

35:44.403 --> 35:46.187
more bar time than me,
so... I just wish

35:46.187 --> 35:48.537
my team didn't have their
holiday plans riding on it.

35:48.537 --> 35:50.278
Our little
SWAT rivalries

35:50.278 --> 35:52.802
must seem silly to you,
huh, being a big-time fed?

35:53.586 --> 35:55.022
Little bit.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.545
But after a day like today, man,

35:56.545 --> 35:57.981
is that such a bad thing?

35:57.981 --> 36:01.115
- Right.
- Listen, you ever
want to transfer

36:01.115 --> 36:03.770
over to the dark side,
you give me a call, okay?

36:03.770 --> 36:05.989
How dumb do I look?

36:05.989 --> 36:07.861
- Later.
- See you.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.389
- Here you go.
- Yep.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.262
Hey. Was
just showing

36:17.262 --> 36:19.916
Terry your locker. He wanted
to leave something for you.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.309
All right. Same thing

36:21.309 --> 36:23.311
we used to leave Mr. Reimer
on his porch?

36:24.660 --> 36:27.707
Trust me, thought about it,
but, uh, no.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.274
Wrote a letter.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.884
I'm gonna bounce. Rocker's
probably out there by now.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.233
See you, Terry.

36:35.497 --> 36:36.759
No, dude,

36:36.759 --> 36:38.587
it's not for you, jackass.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.372
It's for Eva.

36:43.853 --> 36:45.246
Look, I don't know
if it was

36:45.246 --> 36:48.118
defensive instincts or whatever,
but I was a jerk.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.381
I'm just trying
to make it right with her.

36:49.381 --> 36:50.904
Can you please
give her that letter?

36:50.904 --> 36:52.906
You know, I've been
giving a lot of thought

36:52.906 --> 36:55.517
to what you said about
our family being messed-up.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.737
It was the first time
I ever heard you admit it.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.565
Well, it's true, isn't it?

36:59.565 --> 37:02.872
Yeah, but then now
it's up to you and I to fix it.

37:04.613 --> 37:08.269
Should never have kept that
secret from you, man. I'm sorry.

37:08.269 --> 37:11.272
- Wish I could take it back.
- I know how you feel.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.405
Sorry for what I said,
for calling you

37:13.405 --> 37:15.668
- a loser.
- Especially since

37:15.668 --> 37:17.539
- you're the loser.
- Aw...

37:17.539 --> 37:19.889
I'll get this to her,
- all right?
- All right.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.282
Thank you.

37:24.633 --> 37:25.895
There it is,
there it is! Oh!

37:25.895 --> 37:27.767
Yeah! Come on!

37:27.767 --> 37:30.248
Yeah! There you go!

37:30.248 --> 37:31.814
There you go.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.729
20-19, 50-Squad.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.296
Back to the team leaders.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.124
All right, come on,
let's go, Hondo.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.908
Hope 20-Squad doesn't have
any big Christmas plans

37:38.908 --> 37:40.519
- later this year.
- Just the light parade

37:40.519 --> 37:42.434
to see you all
on Santa's security detail.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.262
- All right, keep dreaming.
- Hey, Rocker,

37:44.262 --> 37:46.307
you know I learned how to play
this game in the Marines, right?

37:46.307 --> 37:47.961
All the way out there
in Somalia.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.441
Why you think
I'm so nice with a beanbag?

37:49.441 --> 37:50.572
Good for you.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.095
Nothing teaches you how to win

37:52.095 --> 37:53.488
under pressure like
being in a war zone.

37:53.488 --> 37:56.056
It's all psychological, man.
It's just you

37:56.056 --> 37:58.754
and that hole right there.
Watch this.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.495
Go. Go, Hondo, go.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.325
Yeah!

38:04.325 --> 38:05.979
- Let's go. Come on.
- Yeah!

38:05.979 --> 38:07.850
That's how we do.
What you got?

38:07.850 --> 38:09.417
- Choke, choke, choke.
- Uh-huh.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.333
Oh! Okay.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.248
Time to stop messing around.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.252
Boom!

38:25.172 --> 38:27.348
Last bag. Hondo's
in a tough spot.

38:27.348 --> 38:28.697
Hondo, you got to shoot it!

38:28.697 --> 38:30.046
We ain't in
Somalia no more.

38:30.046 --> 38:31.483
- Okay.
- Shoot it.

38:31.483 --> 38:33.746
All right, here we go.
This is for 20-Squad.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.313
Big drag.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.360
Hondo just made it.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.754
Rocker has to get it
to make it a wash.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.625
This could be game,
what you gonna do?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.932
- Let's go, Rocker.
- All right, Rocker,

38:45.932 --> 38:47.368
you miss, you lose.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.197
Merry Christmas, Hondo.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.506
- Oh!
- Shank!

38:55.637 --> 38:57.117
20-Squad for the win!
Yeah!

38:57.117 --> 38:59.032
You got to pay up, Jack.

38:59.032 --> 39:00.773
Let's go!

39:00.773 --> 39:02.252
- Yeah!
- 20-Squad!

39:02.252 --> 39:04.385
Oh, yeah!20-Squad!

39:04.385 --> 39:05.604
- That's how we do.
- Come on!

39:05.604 --> 39:08.258
- That's how we do. Yeah!
- Come on, baby!

39:10.522 --> 39:12.393
Just wanted to say
how sorry I am

39:12.393 --> 39:14.221
about the way
that all went down earlier.

39:14.221 --> 39:16.658
This is, uh, from Terry.

39:16.658 --> 39:18.443
He wants to fix things.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.967
Look, you can read it
whenever you're ready.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.925
Look, I told him
how lucky we are

39:22.925 --> 39:24.753
to have you
as part of our family.

39:24.753 --> 39:27.930
I swear he's such a good guy
once you get to know him.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.629
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

39:32.282 --> 39:35.242
Look, I came to thank you
for what you tried to do.

39:36.199 --> 39:37.418
But Terry's right.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.899
I'm not a part of your family.

39:39.899 --> 39:41.596
And I never was.

39:42.771 --> 39:45.165
- You can keep his letter.
- Hey.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.950
Durant. Come on,
don't leave it like that.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.257
Eva.

39:50.257 --> 39:53.042
Please?

39:55.871 --> 39:57.264
<i>For 20 years</i>

39:57.264 --> 40:00.572
I've tried to tell myself
it wasn't my fault.

40:00.572 --> 40:03.401
The problem is...

40:03.401 --> 40:06.229
it's kind of a lie, isn't it?

40:06.229 --> 40:09.232
If I hadn't forced
Keith to drive,

40:09.232 --> 40:11.887
if I'd just
stayed awake...

40:13.367 --> 40:16.326
If I'd been a good friend...

40:16.326 --> 40:18.459
he'd still be here.

40:18.459 --> 40:22.289
I'm sorry to Keith,
his family,

40:22.289 --> 40:23.986
to God.

40:25.335 --> 40:28.295
I've always been s-so sorry.

40:28.295 --> 40:29.514
God knows that.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.472
Keith does too.

40:31.472 --> 40:34.693
The tragedy isn't what
turned your life around, David.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.172
By the grace of God,

40:36.172 --> 40:38.479
- you made that choice.
- Then why do I still

40:38.479 --> 40:40.481
- feel guilty?
- Because a miracle

40:40.481 --> 40:43.005
happened to you,
David Kay,

40:43.005 --> 40:47.140
a flawed young man who became
a less-than-perfect adult.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.142
You never felt worthy
of that transformation

40:49.142 --> 40:51.144
and yet a miracle

40:51.144 --> 40:53.668
happened, didn't it?

40:53.668 --> 40:57.193
I-I didn't... I didn't grow up
in a very religious house.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.849
We went to mass
on Christmas and Easter.

41:00.849 --> 41:04.026
I always felt like an
imposter sitting there.

41:04.026 --> 41:06.333
- When'd that change?
- It was the day

41:06.333 --> 41:07.726
of Keith's funeral.

41:07.726 --> 41:10.337
- You were still in the hospital.
- Yeah, but you

41:10.337 --> 41:12.600
wheeled me to the chapel,

41:12.600 --> 41:14.646
broken in every way.

41:14.646 --> 41:15.908
And for hours,

41:15.908 --> 41:18.954
I just stared
at that altar.

41:18.954 --> 41:20.521
That colorfullight--

41:20.521 --> 41:23.263
it was streaming
onto the monstrance.

41:24.438 --> 41:27.310
And I couldn't
take my eyes off Christ.

41:27.310 --> 41:30.226
God willing, I hope I never do.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.925
Took me years
to realize it,

41:32.925 --> 41:36.319
but that day my life
had direction.

41:36.319 --> 41:39.409
That was my miracle.

41:39.409 --> 41:42.195
No one does stained glass
like Catholics.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.198
You've helped me
more than you...

41:45.198 --> 41:47.809
than you could
possibly know, Father.

41:47.809 --> 41:49.594
Thank you.

41:49.594 --> 41:52.031
Right back at you.

41:52.858 --> 41:55.077
God the Father
of mercies has sent

41:55.077 --> 41:56.731
the Holy Spirit
among us for

41:56.731 --> 41:58.559
the forgiveness of sins; may
God give you pardon and peace,

41:58.559 --> 42:00.387
and I absolve you
in the Name of the Father,

42:00.387 --> 42:04.043
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

42:04.043 --> 42:05.435
Amen.
