WHERE IS SHE?

11:24.200 --> 11:27.500
I'M SURE SHE'S SOMEWHERE
HOLDING STILL.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.300

FOR AN ARTIST
TO SEE THEIR WORK
BEFORE A SHOW.

11:37.900 --> 11:40.734

RIGHT INTO PLACE.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.500
I'M SURE IT ALREADY HAS.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.934
ANYWAY, I BETTER
GET THIS THING ON
OVER TO THE GALLERY.

11:48.934 --> 11:51.734
HEY, CHELSE,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, EITHER.

11:51.734 --> 11:52.800
WHY NOT?

11:52.800 --> 11:54.767
BECAUSE IT'S
ALSO BAD LUCK

11:54.767 --> 11:57.200
FOR AN ARTIST TO TAKE
THEIR OWN WORK TO A GALLERY,

11:57.200 --> 11:59.300
SO I'LL BRING IT OVER
