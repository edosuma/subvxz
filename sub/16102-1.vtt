WEBVTT

03:31.586 --> 03:33.054
Okay, Abrams.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.893
Allende.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.938
Bernstein.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.143
Brown.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.148
Come on, come on.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.280
Attboy, Todd

03:55.110 --> 03:56.202
Buckley.

04:01.992 --> 04:02.993
Cohen.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.460
Garcia.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.970
Paul.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.321
Take a seat, Lisa.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.448
I just wanted to take a minute
to talk to you about your test.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.531
Sure.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.951
Now, I know you
had a little help.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.038
Well, I mean, I didn't cheat,
if that's what you mean.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.464
I'm just saying I know
you had a little help.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.041
A lot of people did.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.136
Well, be that
as it may...

04:55.212 --> 04:57.055
I mean, I'll take it
over again if you want,

04:57.214 --> 04:59.091
but, like, what
would be the point?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.176
It's not like I'm
ever gonna actually

05:01.301 --> 05:03.178
need to know this
stuff in my daily life.

05:03.261 --> 05:06.265
Well, that's just not
necessarily true, Lisa.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.187
Haven't you ever developed
an interest in something

05:08.266 --> 05:09.734
that you didn't
initially think

05:09.893 --> 05:11.315
you were gonna develop
an interest in?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.486
Um...

05:12.562 --> 05:14.189
No, not really.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.444
Haven't you ever...

05:19.736 --> 05:21.864
Haven't you ever been put
in a new situation

05:21.947 --> 05:25.497
and found that after
overcoming its difficulties,

05:25.575 --> 05:27.669
you had developed
a new set of skills

05:27.744 --> 05:29.542
and new experiences
along the way?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.339
No, I really haven't.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.707
Okay.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.427
Anyway, it was open-book.

05:35.627 --> 05:39.177
So, what's the difference
between using a book

05:39.256 --> 05:41.679
and, like, I don't know,
using somebody else's mind

05:41.758 --> 05:43.101
who's really
good at math?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.895
I mean, it's not like this person
did the whole test for me.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.063
Oh, no?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.272
No, I did some of it.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.773
Well, next time I'd appreciate
it if you did it all.

05:52.936 --> 05:53.937
Okay?

05:54.271 --> 05:55.773
You are so fair.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.826
What did he
say to you?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.028
Nothing.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.116
Mr. Aaron and I have an understanding
about my math problem.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.582
So the President of the
United States, William B. McKinley,

06:09.744 --> 06:13.248
authorizes the use of private
detectives to break the strike

06:13.748 --> 06:16.001
and they went out there
and shot 'em down!

06:16.626 --> 06:18.378
Just like they
did in Virginia,

06:18.461 --> 06:20.555
just like they
did in Pennsylvania.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.052
Because they didn't care!

06:22.841 --> 06:24.343
They did not care!

06:25.176 --> 06:26.644
And that's basically it.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.639
That's basically
all there is to say.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.767
All right? Go ahead.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.648
- Becky.
- Well...

06:33.977 --> 06:36.025
Mr. Klein! I mean,
was there ever, like,

06:36.146 --> 06:38.194
a good president of
the United States?

06:39.566 --> 06:40.909
I don't
know, Becky.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.369
I think that's
a good question.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.946
What do you think?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.161
You. Lionel.
What do you think?

06:47.324 --> 06:48.997
Did we ever have
a good president?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.920
Um... I don't know.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.291
I guess most of them have just
been, like, totally corrupt.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.792
Lisa?

06:58.001 --> 07:01.050
Can I just say that I'm not
necessarily, like, a big fan

07:01.129 --> 07:03.632
of all the presidents
of the United States,

07:03.715 --> 07:05.513
especially the current one.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.686
But I still don't think it's
necessarily all that useful

07:07.761 --> 07:10.605
to categorize every president
as universally corrupt,

07:10.680 --> 07:13.229
because that just seems
really general to me.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.561
Especially if you're gonna
judge them by the standard

07:15.644 --> 07:17.612
of whatever they're supposed
to traditionally be like

07:17.687 --> 07:19.689
in some mythical
version of America

07:19.773 --> 07:21.821
that probably never
existed to begin with.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.573
Lisa has raised
a salient point.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.746
Tell him to be polite, tell
him to answer the questions,

07:30.825 --> 07:34.170
and I'll arrange for his bail
in the morning. Yes.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.915
Hey,
how'd you do?

07:36.998 --> 07:40.423
Hey, Darren. It was fine.
Thank you so much.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.300
So he didn't give you a
hard time or anything?

07:42.379 --> 07:44.097
Well, he knows
I'm not planning

07:44.172 --> 07:45.970
to go into mathematics
or anything.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.930
He was totally
cool about it.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.477
He's so cool.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.930
Oh, yeah, everybody
loves Mr. Aaron.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.099
What's that supposed
to mean?

07:55.350 --> 07:57.728
Nothing. The man is
very lovable.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.612
What are you doing now?

08:03.817 --> 08:06.070
I was gonna go
look for a cowboy hat.

08:06.695 --> 08:07.821
Why?

08:08.196 --> 08:11.245
Because my dad is supposed to
take me and my brother

08:11.324 --> 08:13.577
to this ranch in New Mexico
to go horseback riding

08:13.660 --> 08:15.333
and I don't think
it would be right

08:15.453 --> 08:17.171
to appear on horseback
in New Mexico

08:17.247 --> 08:20.717
without the appropriate
equestrian paraphernalia, Darren.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.169
You wouldn't
understand these things.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.925
That is a
definite possibility.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.760
Anyway, thanks again.

08:25.880 --> 08:30.306
Well, before you venture forth on your
bizarre quest for a cowboy hat...

08:30.385 --> 08:31.932
Yes, Darren?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.600
What are you up to later?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.772
Like tonight.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.057
I don't know.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.273
You wanna go to a movie?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.609
What, you mean,
like on a date?

08:42.813 --> 08:47.240
No, not on a date,
just go to a movie.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.404
I don't know if
it's a fucking date!

08:49.487 --> 08:51.785
All right. Calm down.
What do you wanna see?

08:52.282 --> 08:55.126
I don't know, I don't
even know what's playing.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.125
I don't know
if it's a date.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.300
Let's just forget about it. I
hate the fucking' movies anyway.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.002
They're just bullshit.
They're all bullshit!

09:04.085 --> 09:06.804
Okay, take it easy. I'm sorry.
I was just asking!

09:10.300 --> 09:12.519
What if it was
a date, anyway?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.638
Would that be
so horrendous?

09:19.517 --> 09:22.316
Oh, my God.
Are you like...

09:23.229 --> 09:25.027
Are you asking me out?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.613
I don't know.
Are you?

09:31.696 --> 09:34.324
Yeah. I mean...

09:34.491 --> 09:36.084
I feel like we're
already really close...

09:36.159 --> 09:37.160
Oh, my God.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.666
...and I think we'd
be a really good match.

09:42.665 --> 09:46.715
Well, I would definitely
have to think about this.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.422
Absolutely.
Give it some thought.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.677
Okay. I will.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.841
Okay.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.186
Why do you look
like that?

09:56.304 --> 09:57.521
Like what?

09:58.556 --> 10:00.183
What do you want from me?
Not a thing!

10:00.850 --> 10:03.854
AH right. I'll see
you later.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.438
All right.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.628
Hello!

10:43.560 --> 10:44.732
Hi.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.275
Is Mom home?

10:46.396 --> 10:47.443
She went to the store.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.033
Hey!

10:54.112 --> 10:55.238
What are you
doing tonight?

10:55.405 --> 10:58.875
Nothing. Darren wants me
to go to the movies with him.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.373
Oh, my God.
What's that about?

11:01.703 --> 11:03.171
I have no idea.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.269
Becky, there is
not a cowboy hat

11:21.389 --> 11:23.062
to be found in
the entire Upper West Side.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.189
And I am very
depressed about it.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.236
The Upper West
Side is saving you from yourself

11:27.312 --> 11:29.815
because no one wants
to see you in that hat.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.808
Hey! Hey!

12:09.354 --> 12:10.651
Where'd you get...

12:10.813 --> 12:12.156
How you doin”?

12:12.690 --> 12:13.691
Your hat!

12:14.484 --> 12:15.485
What?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.161
Where'd you get
your cowboy hat?

12:18.446 --> 12:19.663
What?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.035
What are you, crazy?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.119
Hi.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.501
Where'd you get
your cowboy hat?

12:28.206 --> 12:29.298
My hat?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.462
Yeah! Your cowboy hat!

12:30.541 --> 12:32.794
You like my cowboy hat?
Really?

12:33.419 --> 12:35.046
Yes! Where did you get it?

13:45.742 --> 13:46.914
Somebody see
what happen?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.662
Somebody call
an ambulance!

13:48.745 --> 13:50.747
Call an ambulance.
Everybody just step back!

13:50.830 --> 13:51.922
I'm calling one right now!

13:51.998 --> 13:53.124
- Can you hear me?
- Get an ambulance!

13:53.207 --> 13:54.333
Someone's calling one!

13:54.417 --> 13:55.634
Ma'am, can you hear me?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.087
Can you hear me?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.592
I don't know!
Where am I?

13:58.796 --> 14:00.298
You're on Broadway and
75th Street in New York.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.507
Between 75th and 74th Street.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.184
- You were in a bad accident.
- Who are you?

14:03.259 --> 14:04.681
My name is Lisa.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.224
What do you mean? Am I dead?

14:06.304 --> 14:07.681
No, you're not dead.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.516
You were in a traffic accident,
but you're gonna be...

14:09.599 --> 14:11.693
What do you mean?
What happened'?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.691
You were run over by a bus.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.779
You've got to be kidding me.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.482
A bus?
Yeah.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.942
ls there
a doctor anywhere?

14:19.108 --> 14:20.485
Is it
still happening?

14:20.568 --> 14:21.615
An ambulance is on its way.

14:21.778 --> 14:22.870
The accident's over.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.162
I think you're
a little confused.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.532
I'll say I'm confused.

14:25.615 --> 14:26.992
Here.
Let me just try...

14:27.075 --> 14:28.702
No! Don't let go!
Ma'am!

14:28.826 --> 14:31.955
- Don't let go of me! Don't let go of me.
- I won't.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.881
I won't. I'm not gonna let go.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.208
Thank you. Thank you, honey.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.256
She needs a tourniquet
or she's going to die.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.837
Okay, let me just...

14:38.920 --> 14:40.297
Oh, my God!

14:41.631 --> 14:42.632
Jesus Christ!

14:42.715 --> 14:45.810
Help! God, what's
happening to me!

14:47.387 --> 14:48.513
I'm sorry.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.564
I'm trying to put
a tourniquet on you.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.017
Ma'am, we need to get
a tourniquet on you.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.477
Do you have a belt?
You can use your belt.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.776
I just can't see
where to do it.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.149
You're gonna be
all right, so just hang on.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.440
Thank you, honey.
Just don't let go of me.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.237
They're gonna put
a tourniquet on you.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.694
What do you mean?
Are they doctors'?

15:02.777 --> 15:05.997
No, they're not doctors.
They were just passing by.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.073
Well, get 'em
the fuck away from me!

15:07.156 --> 15:08.123
Ma'am!

15:08.199 --> 15:10.247
Ma'am! We're only
trying to help you!

15:10.326 --> 15:12.044
Never mind that!
Just try putting it around...

15:12.120 --> 15:14.043
Do you wanna do it? You know how to do it.
You wanna do it?

15:14.122 --> 15:15.715
Are you kidding me!

15:15.790 --> 15:17.633
I can't see
anything.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.341
Are my eyes open or closed?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.095
They're open.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.941
What do you mean?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.856
You were in
a terrible accident.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.438
But you're gonna be fine,
so just hang on, okay?

15:38.813 --> 15:42.317
There's no place to put it.
I can't even find a...

15:42.442 --> 15:44.285
Will somebody call
the fucking ambulance!

15:44.360 --> 15:45.953
Calm down!
We already called them!

15:46.028 --> 15:47.826
They're obviously
not coming fast enough,

15:47.947 --> 15:49.745
so maybe you
should call them again!

15:49.824 --> 15:51.201
Why not call them again?

15:52.994 --> 15:54.371
You're gonna be...
Could somebody...

15:55.163 --> 15:56.836
Could somebody
call my daughter?

15:56.914 --> 15:59.087
Sure! We can call her.
What's her name?

16:00.376 --> 16:02.128
Just tell me her name
and give me her number.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.303
It's Lisa.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.723
No, that's my name.
Is that your daughter's name?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.971
What? What are you
talking about?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.098
I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to be confusing.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.180
My name is Lisa.
Is that your daughter's name?

16:12.263 --> 16:14.812
Jesus Christ, just call her!
Would you call her?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.027
I can't call her if you
don't give me the number.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.271
I got it.
I got it!

16:21.230 --> 16:22.447
Ma'am?

16:22.523 --> 16:24.150
- You're gonna be okay.
- You're gonna be okay!

16:24.233 --> 16:25.576
What's your
daughter's number?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.529
Sweetie,

16:29.405 --> 16:30.406
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.491
Oh, no!

16:31.574 --> 16:34.623
Please hang on. The ambulance
is gonna be here any minute!

16:34.702 --> 16:36.830
So just hang on, okay?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.085
Please!

16:38.247 --> 16:39.419
It's okay.

16:40.583 --> 16:41.835
She's gone.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.256
No! No!

16:43.961 --> 16:45.008
She's gone.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.054
Please let go of me!

16:46.130 --> 16:48.679
Please, let go of me!
Please, let go of me!

16:48.758 --> 16:51.978
Just hang on. They're gonna
be here any minute, okay?

16:52.053 --> 16:53.225
So just hang on!

16:53.638 --> 16:55.185
You're gonna be okay!

17:05.691 --> 17:06.692
You were going
the speed limit?

17:06.776 --> 17:07.777
Yeah.

17:08.069 --> 17:11.743
Lisa? You're Lisa? I just want to
ask you a few questions, okay?

17:11.821 --> 17:12.823
Yeah, sure.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.750
Now, just tell me
everything you saw,

17:14.825 --> 17:17.999
even if you think it might
not be important. All right?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.080
Think of it like a movie.
Like you're watching' a movie

17:20.164 --> 17:21.461
in your head...

17:21.582 --> 17:22.834
It was green as I
came to the intersection.

17:22.916 --> 17:23.884
Could
somebody call my mother?

17:23.960 --> 17:24.961
We already called
your mom,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.262
but I'll have 'em put another call
in to your mother right now, okay?

17:27.338 --> 17:28.760
I know this is
hard for you,

17:28.839 --> 17:31.217
but we gotta get this while it's
still fresh in your mind, okay?

17:31.300 --> 17:32.677
Some of these questions
might seem like

17:32.802 --> 17:34.224
they don't make
a lot of sense to you.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.180
They do make
sense. Just ask me!

17:36.347 --> 17:38.441
Okay, that's what
I'm doin'. All right?

17:38.516 --> 17:41.395
So now I'm gonna ask you,
from where you were standing,

17:41.477 --> 17:42.979
could you see
the traffic light?

17:44.605 --> 17:48.075
Could you tell me if it was red?
Yellow? Green?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.367
She just came
out of nowhere?

17:49.443 --> 17:50.990
What color
was the light?

17:51.529 --> 17:53.327
Boy, I'm sorry...

17:57.994 --> 17:59.541
I..

18:00.413 --> 18:02.165
I guess it was green?

18:02.290 --> 18:03.792
Green?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.503
I think it was
just an accident.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.474
Where were
you at?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.093
I was on Broadway.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.190
What happened to you?
Nothing.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.693
Hello?

20:07.456 --> 20:09.208
So, does anybody
know who she was?

20:09.625 --> 20:11.673
I don't know. I guess
she lived around here

20:11.794 --> 20:13.842
if she had all these
Fairway grocery bags.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.214
What did they do
with her leg?

20:15.297 --> 20:17.015
I have no fucking idea.
Hey...

20:21.971 --> 20:24.099
Lisa? Are you sure
you don't want me to call in?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.933
Oh, no, thanks.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.269
I mean, thank you.
That's really sweet.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.647
But I'm supposed to
go see Becky anyway,

20:30.730 --> 20:33.483
and I don't really want to sit
here thinking about it all night.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.364
Go to work.
I'll be all right.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.844
- Hey.
- Hey, Darren.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.716
Hey.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.564
Joan?
Yeah?

21:05.765 --> 21:06.982
You got some flowers.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.351
Can you bring 'em in?

21:10.186 --> 21:12.689
Oh, that's good.
I'm glad you guys liked it.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.944
You were great.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.868
Well, we have a lot of
work to do, but it'll be good.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.028
The critics
are gonna love it.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.118
They don't even
know me anymore.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.414
Hey, are you
comin' out?

21:22.531 --> 21:23.783
Um... I don't know.
I'm not sure.

21:23.866 --> 21:24.992
Come on.
Maybe I will.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.543
I don't know if I'm going to.
But I might.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.295
See you later.
Bye.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.709
- Goodnight.
- See you later.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.879
Hi, are you Ramon?

21:32.958 --> 21:37.213
Yes. Hello. You were
wonderful again.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.846
Oh, you're so sweet. And thank
you for the beautiful flowers.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.347
You're very welcome.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.845
And you've seen
the show before?

21:43.928 --> 21:45.475
Yes, two times.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.058
Gosh. That's a lot!

21:49.266 --> 21:51.485
It's a beautiful performance.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.650
I'm sure you will
have a big success.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.699
Well, right now, we're just trying
to focus on what we're doing.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.486
I don't know
if you are busy,

21:59.568 --> 22:02.367
but would you allow
me to buy you a drink?

22:02.446 --> 22:04.369
If you like to
ask your friends...

22:04.532 --> 22:06.580
I'm sorry. I can't.
I'm just on my way home.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.748
Okay, that's no problem.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.501
Tomorrow I'm going
to London for a few days.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.627
Perhaps when I come back.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.132
Um...

22:15.042 --> 22:16.760
Yeah.
Okay.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.263
I'm sorry.
I really have to go.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.848
Okay. That's
no problem.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.392
Anyway, thanks again
for the beautiful flowers!

22:23.467 --> 22:24.719
It's a privilege
to meet you.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.096
It's nice to meet
you, too.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.393
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.560
Hey.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.317
I thought you
were at the movies.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.940
Yeah, it wasn't
very good.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.781
I was
doing a show in Detroit

22:40.860 --> 22:42.703
and this woman
came backstage,

22:42.778 --> 22:43.779
and she's like,
"Wanna come back

22:43.946 --> 22:44.947
"to my place and
do some cocaine?"

22:45.030 --> 22:47.499
I was like,
"I know the kind of pussy..."

22:47.575 --> 22:49.543
Why you pop in
at 4:00 in the morning?

22:52.788 --> 22:53.789
I'll get us thrown out.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.377
Oh, oh. Do the Shirley Temple
! Come on, do the Shirley Temple.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.508
Okay.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.467
J' On the good ship Lollipop

23:04.550 --> 23:07.178
J' It's a sweet
trip to the candy shop

23:07.261 --> 23:08.888
J' And there you are

23:08.971 --> 23:11.224
J' Happy landing
on the chocolate bar

23:11.599 --> 23:13.226
J' If you eat too much

23:13.309 --> 23:15.152
.l' Oh! Oh! You'll... J'

23:15.561 --> 23:16.653
Keep going!

23:18.772 --> 23:20.069
That's awesome!

23:21.150 --> 23:23.323
Wait, what's that one?
Do the baby.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.657
No,
it's too weird.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.992
You have
to do the baby.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.116
Some inspiration.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.885
It's so disturbing.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.345
I know.
It's too weird.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.421
No, it's not.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.505
Have another drink.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.264
I think we can
tell I've had enough.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.732
Matthew, if you would read
the role of France.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.661
And, Anthony, why don't
you read Burgundy?

25:29.194 --> 25:31.071
Burgundy.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.954
And I guess I'm gonna hog
the part of Lear again.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.502
Okay, Anthony?

25:38.954 --> 25:41.958
"Royal Majesty,
I crave no more

25:42.041 --> 25:43.884
"than what your
highness offered,

25:43.959 --> 25:45.677
"nor will you
tender less."

25:46.086 --> 25:47.838
"Right, noble Burgundy,

25:47.921 --> 25:51.221
"When she was dear to us,
we did hold her so,

25:51.300 --> 25:53.177
"But now her
price is fall’s."

26:08.025 --> 26:10.027
My family are
from Colombia.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.954
My father worked in
the diplomatic service.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.327
Really? Wow.

26:15.157 --> 26:19.287
I grew up five years in Panama
and nine years in Paris.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.338
And what do
you do, Ramon?

26:21.497 --> 26:25.593
I have a company.
We design computer software

26:25.667 --> 26:28.637
to help companies
in South American countries

26:28.796 --> 26:31.345
that use an
incompatible software,

26:31.590 --> 26:34.059
so the computers can
talk to each other.

26:35.344 --> 26:38.018
It's a big problem
in South America

26:38.305 --> 26:43.903
where there is not so much coordination
in computer communication.

26:44.978 --> 26:48.107
Right now is a lot
of opportunity for us

26:48.190 --> 26:52.195
because for the big software
companies, we are still the backwoods.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.244
That's changing quite fast.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.587
Can I give you a lift?

27:02.663 --> 27:06.384
Oh, no, thank you, I'm just
gonna grab a cab. But thanks.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.466
May I call
you sometime?

27:11.505 --> 27:14.099
Okay. Sure,
that would be great.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.761
May I have your
telephone number?

28:03.599 --> 28:04.942
Mom?
Just a minute!

28:05.017 --> 28:06.018
Can I come in?

28:06.143 --> 28:07.144
Just a second, please.
Hold on.

28:11.857 --> 28:12.858
Come in.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.580
Can I talk to you?

28:23.452 --> 28:24.795
Sure. What's up?

28:26.622 --> 28:28.169
I'm supposed
to go back to

28:28.290 --> 28:30.133
the police to
confirm my statement

28:30.375 --> 28:31.877
the day after tomorrow.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.797
So what do you
think I should do?

28:37.299 --> 28:39.677
Well, I don't know, sweetie.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.640
I mean, that bus driver probably
has a family to support.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.229
He could probably
lose his job.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.894
So I think you
should really think

28:48.977 --> 28:51.025
about that before
you say anything.

28:54.650 --> 28:55.742
Okay?

28:57.819 --> 28:58.820
Yeah.

29:00.948 --> 29:03.451
Think of the
implications of what you're saying.

29:03.784 --> 29:06.162
I'm saying what is
the frame of reference

29:06.286 --> 29:08.664
for the average
Arab on the street?

29:09.331 --> 29:12.426
Angie. Yeah. My mother's
family is from Syria,

29:12.501 --> 29:14.048
and they're not exactly in
love with the current regime.

29:14.127 --> 29:17.256
And I definitely don't agree with
a lot of their religious views,

29:17.339 --> 29:19.341
especially when it comes to
the oppression of women.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.929
But I just wanna say
that Americans have no idea

29:23.011 --> 29:24.558
how much people hate them
all over the world.

29:24.638 --> 29:25.810
It's pretty
clear to us now, Angie.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.937
And all my relatives
in Syria think what

29:28.058 --> 29:30.152
we did in Afghanistan
was terrorism, okay?

29:30.227 --> 29:31.774
Anthony?
Not to mention Iraq.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.526
Syria is a theocratic
military dictatorship.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.274
No, it's not. Sorry.

29:35.357 --> 29:37.576
Syria is not a theocratic
military dictatorship?

29:37.651 --> 29:39.324
I think we have
a pretty good idea how

29:39.444 --> 29:41.117
much people hate us now,
actually, Angie.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.288
No, we don't.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.992
They blew up our city, okay? So, yeah,
I think we have a pretty good idea

29:45.075 --> 29:46.122
and personally,
I don't give a shit.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.168
You should.

29:47.244 --> 29:48.712
The people who blew
up the World Trade

29:48.829 --> 29:50.297
Center were a bunch
of sick monsters.

29:50.372 --> 29:51.339
Oh, they were monsters?
Yes!

29:51.415 --> 29:52.416
Why, because they're Arabs?

29:52.499 --> 29:53.967
No, because they killed
3,000 people for no reason.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.134
Maybe they think
they had a reason!

29:55.210 --> 29:56.177
One at a time!
Like what?

29:56.253 --> 29:57.345
Why did we
drop bombs on them?

29:57.462 --> 29:58.588
What should
we have done?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.431
Why did we invade Iraq
They declared war on us.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.134
No, they didn't. Iraq
didn't declare war on anybody!

30:02.217 --> 30:03.719
They didn't do
anything to us!

30:03.802 --> 30:05.349
Come on,
guys, one at a time!

30:06.221 --> 30:07.973
Anthony.
They did have a reason.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.023
Thank you.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.521
They wanted to
establish a medieval

30:10.642 --> 30:12.064
Islamic caliphate
in the Middle East

30:12.144 --> 30:13.987
and destroy
Western civilization.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.234
Where did you read that?

30:15.355 --> 30:16.527
It's on their website.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.525
Okay, forget it.
Angie!

30:18.608 --> 30:19.609
No! Forget it!

30:19.735 --> 30:20.782
Go ahead with
what you were saying!

30:20.861 --> 30:21.828
No! Why should I?

30:21.903 --> 30:24.076
But why are you defending someone
who murdered 3,000 people?

30:24.156 --> 30:25.328
I'm not!

30:25.407 --> 30:27.034
Why are you
defending a country that

30:27.159 --> 30:28.786
unilaterally invaded
two Muslim countries

30:28.910 --> 30:30.457
and supports the Israeli
occupation of Palestine?

30:30.537 --> 30:32.084
Give me a break!

30:32.164 --> 30:34.007
And drops bombs on
women and children

30:34.082 --> 30:35.299
and then calls
other people terrorists

30:35.417 --> 30:36.634
for doing
the exact same thing?

30:36.710 --> 30:38.633
Because it's not the same thing!
Yes, it is!

30:38.712 --> 30:40.430
- Come on, guys.
- Lionel! Go ahead.

30:42.090 --> 30:46.015
Yeah, I just want to ask why is
it okay to drop bombs on men

30:46.094 --> 30:49.519
but it's not okay to drop
bombs on women and children?

30:49.598 --> 30:51.896
I mean, isn't that
just like reverse sexism?

30:52.893 --> 30:55.396
I don't know. I agree
it's a bullshit term.

30:55.479 --> 30:56.605
This is totally stupid.

30:56.730 --> 30:57.856
Monica!

30:58.982 --> 31:02.361
I think the whole class should
apologize to Angie, actually,

31:02.444 --> 31:04.071
'cause all she did
was express her opinion

31:04.196 --> 31:05.869
about what her
relatives in Syria think.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.824
Thank you! And everyone
started screaming at her

31:07.908 --> 31:10.206
like she was
defending the Ku Klux Klan!

31:10.285 --> 31:13.539
They are the Ku Klux Klan! They
throw acid in woman’s faces.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.374
Who? Afghanistan? Why not drop
bombs on the Ku Klux Klan!

31:15.457 --> 31:16.504
Because they're white?

31:16.583 --> 31:18.051
Six people raised their hands
before you, Lisa.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.345
MR. Come on, guys.
The correct term is Afghans.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.387
Okay, I'm not even saying
I disagree with you.

31:24.466 --> 31:27.060
I'm just saying it's pathetic the way
people in this class treated Angie

31:27.135 --> 31:29.354
just for saying something they
didn't happen to agree with.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.306
Because that's
censorship. Right?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.441
Right?
It's not censorship!

31:33.558 --> 31:35.276
Right on! This class
is not the government.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.651
It's censorship. Oh,
my God, no, it's not!

31:40.524 --> 31:43.152
We work out of Highway One
out in the Bronx.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.828
Near the Bronx Zoo.

31:44.903 --> 31:45.995
Oh, okay.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.246
But for a situation...

31:47.322 --> 31:49.541
Hey, how are you doin'?
But for something' like this,

31:49.616 --> 31:52.790
we usually find a local
precinct or an apartment.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.373
Whatever will expediate the
situation most effectively.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.423
Have a seat wherever you want.
Just pull up a chair.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.305
According to this statement,
the light was green

32:03.380 --> 32:04.848
when the bus passed
through the intersection.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.008
Yes.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.515
So you're saying she walked
against the light?

32:16.184 --> 32:17.185
Yeah.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.362
It's true.
Two years of college,

32:23.442 --> 32:25.865
two years at the magazine.
Two years with you.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.284
I'm kind of
a two-year gal!

32:32.242 --> 32:33.710
What's funny
about that?

32:47.299 --> 32:48.892
What did you
think of the play?

32:49.593 --> 32:51.095
It was okay.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.998
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad!

33:12.073 --> 33:13.199
Yeah! Hi!

33:13.283 --> 33:14.409
How are you?

33:14.534 --> 33:15.626
I'm okay. I'm fine.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.455
I'm just sitting here, looking at the
ocean, trying' to do a little work,

33:19.247 --> 33:20.999
listening to some music.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.839
How are you?
I'm okay.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.337
Are you practicing
your horseback riding?

33:25.420 --> 33:27.422
Oh, yeah, I've
really been riding a lot.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.634
I'm getting' these
really bad saddle sores.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.511
Are you?

33:32.636 --> 33:33.933
No,
I'm kidding.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.731
Yeah. Do you know

33:36.932 --> 33:39.526
Claremont Stables on 89th
between Columbus and Amsterdam?

33:39.601 --> 33:40.648
Yeah.

33:40.769 --> 33:41.861
Well, it might be
really worth your while

33:41.937 --> 33:44.736
to go over there and maybe sign
up for a couple of lessons.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.532
No...
I'd be happy to...

33:46.775 --> 33:47.867
I'm sorry, what?

33:47.943 --> 33:49.866
I was just saying I'd be
very happy to spring for it

33:49.945 --> 33:51.618
if you want to take
a couple of lessons.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.453
I think it would
pay off in the end.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.409
Thanks. I actually
may take you up on that.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.411
Yeah, just let me know.

33:57.494 --> 33:58.916
I appreciate that.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.459
So, how's school?

34:00.789 --> 34:04.293
School's okay. I'm kind of
fucking up in geometry.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.295
But I assume
you're not torpedoing

34:06.419 --> 34:07.921
your scholarship or
anything like that?

34:08.004 --> 34:09.880
Nope. The scholarship's on.
Okay, good.

34:09.965 --> 34:13.389
Well, math was never my
strong suit either, so...

34:13.467 --> 34:16.266
I guess I'm following in your
footsteps in that regard.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.313
Well, I'm proud
to hear it.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.317
So, how are you?

34:21.893 --> 34:26.023
Um... I'm okay. Things are okay.

34:26.106 --> 34:29.906
They're a little slow
and a little frustrating.

34:30.025 --> 34:32.120
But there's one or
two projects we're

34:32.237 --> 34:34.331
going after that
seem to look promising.

34:34.656 --> 34:38.159
And I don't know,
I think it's okay.

34:38.868 --> 34:39.869
Okay.

34:41.036 --> 34:42.583
How's the boyfriend situation?

34:42.664 --> 34:44.041
Oh. The same.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.125
Nobody...

34:45.208 --> 34:46.208
They're all kind
of the same.

34:46.543 --> 34:49.092
Well, I know this is not
going to go anywhere,

34:49.170 --> 34:52.264
but our next workshop is
comprised, for the most part,

34:52.340 --> 34:55.264
of strapping young men of
about 17 years old who,

34:55.677 --> 34:57.850
for some peculiar reason, are
interested in using their brains

34:57.929 --> 34:58.930
to get on with their lives.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.982
Nobody really understands
why or how this happened,

35:01.057 --> 35:02.354
but if you're
interested in meeting any

35:02.517 --> 35:03.814
of them when you
come out next time...

35:03.893 --> 35:08.490
Yeah, I don't really go for the
California type, but thanks.

35:09.691 --> 35:13.992
Well, I don't either, per se. It
depends on the person, obviously.

35:14.529 --> 35:18.329
Hard to argue with. I think
I'll stop generalizing now.

35:18.908 --> 35:22.128
Well, that's about
it on my end, sweetie.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.921
I'll give you
a call in a week or two.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.174
Give my love to Curtis.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.634
Okay. Well...

35:28.293 --> 35:29.886
I love you.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.672
I love you, too. Bye.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.023
You do know I
have two kids, right?

35:46.144 --> 35:48.067
Yes. I would like
to meet them.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.231
You are really smooth.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.694
I would love to
meet your kids.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.071
I have two boys myself.
I'm not smooth.

35:59.449 --> 36:01.201
Would you like to
have a nightcap?

36:06.998 --> 36:08.250
I just...

36:09.918 --> 36:12.216
I feel like we used to
be really close, like,

36:13.380 --> 36:15.348
up until a few days ago,

36:15.423 --> 36:18.518
and I'm really not getting
that from you anymore.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.936
Becky, give me a break.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.857
Now you wanna do
the other nostril

36:28.937 --> 36:32.111
because you always want to be symmetrical.
Very important.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.990
You are so funny.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.450
symmetry

36:45.412 --> 36:47.915
So, what do
we do now?

36:48.915 --> 36:50.337
Now we make out.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.926
Paul! What about
your girlfriend?

36:52.585 --> 36:54.178
I'm sorry.
It just sounded like

36:54.295 --> 36:55.968
you asked me
about my girlfriend.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.926
Oh, never mind.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.318
I don't know, man.
I don't wanna get into it.

37:37.046 --> 37:39.674
You know I really
love you, right?

37:42.427 --> 37:43.428
Not really.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.132
I gotta go home.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.715
I'm just gonna
head out, too.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.560
You need a little help,
I take it?

38:46.157 --> 38:47.158
Joan, are
you all right?

38:47.575 --> 38:50.124
Yes, fine.
I'll be out in a sec.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.767
Okay, we're gonna start with
a few simple stretches.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.597
I want you all to watch me
first, and then you'll follow.

39:08.721 --> 39:11.725
All right,
so left arm goes up.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.812
And then all
the way over to the side,

39:14.936 --> 39:17.985
you're gonna
feel a long stretch

39:18.064 --> 39:20.283
along the side of your body.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.697
All right.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.377
Mr. Aaron?

39:31.494 --> 39:33.087
Yes, Becky... Lisa?

39:34.330 --> 39:35.798
Are you still mad
at me about the test?

39:37.375 --> 39:38.968
What's going on, Lisa?

39:39.711 --> 39:41.304
Because maybe
the bus driver

39:41.462 --> 39:43.055
is completely
devastated as it is,

39:43.131 --> 39:45.133
and I'm just gonna
be this rich girl who

39:45.258 --> 39:47.226
calls up the cops to
ease her conscience.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.975
What does your being rich
have to do with anything?

39:49.095 --> 39:50.062
You know what I mean.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.139
No, I don't.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.484
I don't mean literally rich. I mean
rich compared to the bus driver.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.028
Lionel? I'm going
to need five minutes.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.317
I just thought you
wanted to know that

39:58.479 --> 39:59.696
there's a lot of
people out here

39:59.814 --> 40:01.157
and it's kind of
hard to breathe.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.779
You better close
that door now, Lionel.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.280
I'm sorry, I gotta
let these guys in.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.331
I don't want to leave you hanging.
Look, if you're hurting,

40:12.493 --> 40:13.995
we could get a cup of
coffee after school.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.622
I'd do that.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.697
Hey, does this
dress make me look fat?

40:42.190 --> 40:43.817
Um... A little.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.246
Well, there's nothing
I can do about it.

40:49.906 --> 40:50.907
Where are you going?

40:51.199 --> 40:52.200
The opera.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.578
Why are you
going to the opera?

40:54.869 --> 40:56.712
Turns out he's
a big opera fan.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.832
Anyway, don't you
think it sounds kind of fun?

40:58.915 --> 41:00.212
We should all go sometime.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.542
No, thanks.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.212
Why not? I bet
you'd like it.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.675
I don't like that
kind of singing.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.506
You like classical music.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.512
Yes, that's true, but I
don't like opera singing.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.556
When have you ever... It's
like their entire reason

41:10.635 --> 41:12.353
for existing is to prove
how loud they can be.

41:12.428 --> 41:14.851
I don't really find
that all that interesting.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.937
Yeah. I know what
you mean, but it's not

41:17.058 --> 41:18.731
all like that.
You like The Magic Flute.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.855
Okay. I guess I'm wrong.
I guess I do like

41:21.980 --> 41:24.654
opera singing.
I just didn't realize it.

41:26.734 --> 41:27.826
What is the matter
with you?

41:27.944 --> 41:29.070
Nothing at all.

41:29.362 --> 41:31.660
Why are you pushing this? I
don't want to go to the opera!

41:31.739 --> 41:33.332
Yes, okay.
I'm not pushing anything.

41:33.408 --> 41:34.705
All you have say is,
"No, thanks."

41:34.784 --> 41:36.582
I did and then you
were like, "Why not?"

41:36.744 --> 41:39.167
So then I told you, and then
you started debating me,

41:39.247 --> 41:40.248
like you assumed
that I've never

41:40.331 --> 41:41.332
thought this
through for myself,

41:41.416 --> 41:43.009
which I have, many times!

41:43.084 --> 41:46.714
Okay, well that was a really
contemptuous assumption on my part.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.510
I don't actually
like the opera that much

41:48.589 --> 41:50.182
myself, but I'm
trying to expand my mind,

41:50.258 --> 41:51.931
maybe that's wrong.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.682
I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little
nervous about you guys meeting Ramon.

41:57.765 --> 41:59.233
Why? What's the big deal?
Why are you so

41:59.350 --> 42:00.818
influenced by
what Curtis and me...

42:01.936 --> 42:03.062
...what Curtis and I think?

42:06.691 --> 42:08.364
Hey, why does everything
I say annoy you?

42:08.443 --> 42:10.537
Jesus Christ,
I'm just sitting here.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.909
Here, you be me, and say
anything and I'll respond to you

42:12.989 --> 42:15.333
the way you've been responding
to me this whole conversation.

42:15.408 --> 42:16.534
Go ahead,
you say something to me...

42:16.659 --> 42:17.785
No! I'm not gonna do that.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.371
Why not?
Because it's dumb!

42:19.454 --> 42:20.922
I'm horrible.
I get your point!

42:20.997 --> 42:22.590
Oh, okay. Whatever.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.464
Was that supposed to be an
imitation of me?

42:25.710 --> 42:26.882
Mmm. Okay, withdrawn.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.808
Are you coming to
my opening night?

42:33.176 --> 42:34.473
I will if I have to.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.600
You're a little cunt,
you know that?

42:36.721 --> 42:37.813
Yes. You're a big cunt.

42:38.014 --> 42:39.812
Okay, let's not start talking
to each other that way.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.689
You just called
me a cunt, Mom.

42:41.768 --> 42:43.566
I'm sorry I said that...
Why? It's refreshing.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.942
If you're saying you're not aware
you've been really annoyed with me,

42:46.022 --> 42:47.569
or really irritable
with me and it doesn't

42:47.690 --> 42:49.237
matter if I express
it exactly accurately,

42:49.317 --> 42:50.944
because you know what I'm trying to say.
Not really.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.995
If you're really saying that
you're completely unaware of that,

42:53.071 --> 42:55.790
then I have to say I don't think
you're being honest about it.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.412
Now, maybe I'm
doing something horrible

42:57.533 --> 42:59.126
to you without
being aware of it,

42:59.202 --> 43:01.500
but I have a show opening in two
weeks, I'm really nervous about it,

43:01.704 --> 43:02.876
I'm seeing a new person

43:02.955 --> 43:05.333
and I'm obviously anxious about
you and Curtis liking him,

43:05.458 --> 43:07.677
you were involved in this
horrible, traumatic accident,

43:07.752 --> 43:10.255
you're going on this crazy horseback
riding trip with your father...

43:10.338 --> 43:12.261
Oh, my God! ...which sounds like
a recipe for disaster to me.

43:12.673 --> 43:13.845
And on top of
everything else, Lisa,

43:14.008 --> 43:15.225
ever since I told
you about Ramon,

43:15.510 --> 43:17.137
you have been
treating me like I'm insane.

43:17.220 --> 43:18.346
I think you're exaggerating.

43:18.471 --> 43:19.563
Now, what am I supposed to do?

43:19.639 --> 43:20.731
What am I supposed to do?

43:20.848 --> 43:21.974
Just stop whining
about everything!

43:22.058 --> 43:23.935
It doesn't matter.
None of it matters at all.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.065
You've been in
a million plays,

43:25.144 --> 43:27.317
you always get freaked out
because of what some dumb critic

43:27.396 --> 43:29.069
is gonna say
about your dumb play.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.491
I don't frankly
give a shit about Ramon

43:30.608 --> 43:31.985
or who you're going
out with this week.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.160
I never go out with anyone.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.704
I don't care!
Don't talk to me like that!

43:34.779 --> 43:36.577
I've barely had a date
for the last two years!

43:36.656 --> 43:38.533
Yeah, but I don't care about any of it.
It doesn't matter.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.540
Your boyfriend doesn't matter. Your
play doesn't matter, except to you.

43:41.702 --> 43:44.080
I don't care about New Mexico,
because to tell you the truth,

43:44.163 --> 43:45.130
I'm probably not even going.

43:45.206 --> 43:46.799
What do you mean? Want to
know something else, Mom?

43:46.874 --> 43:48.171
There are more
important problems

43:48.292 --> 43:49.589
in the world than
our relationship.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.838
There is a whole city out there
full of people who are dying,

43:51.921 --> 43:54.049
so who gives a shit if I
like your fucking boyfriend?

43:54.132 --> 43:56.635
It is so trivial.
Why are you bothering me

43:56.717 --> 43:58.811
with all this?
It doesn't matter.

44:02.932 --> 44:06.186
Well, should I
have him come up now?

44:07.270 --> 44:09.398
Or should I
have him wait downstairs?

44:10.231 --> 44:11.949
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.786
Lisa, I don't even know
what we're talking about.

44:16.946 --> 44:18.448
I know you don't.
That's the problem.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.291
Oh, give me a break.

44:24.412 --> 44:25.834
Everything is all right?

44:25.997 --> 44:29.171
Oh, yeah. Oh. I'm so excited
to be going to the opera.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.757
I don't think I've really gone
more than one or two times.

44:32.044 --> 44:35.423
I wish it wasn't Norma,
but still it's fun to go.

44:36.048 --> 44:38.096
What if we went to see
something else instead?

44:38.301 --> 44:39.302
You don't want
to hear Norma?

44:39.427 --> 44:40.474
Oh, no, I don't mean that.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.055
I just meant,
wouldn't it be funny

44:42.180 --> 44:43.727
if we walked into one
of the other events?

44:43.931 --> 44:45.274
Like, what if we
just went to see

44:45.433 --> 44:46.776
the Daniel Goldfarb
play instead?

44:47.435 --> 44:49.312
I think
you will enjoy this.

46:03.135 --> 46:04.887
It's beautiful.
Shh.

46:40.423 --> 46:42.221
This is the dumbest
book I've ever read.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.604
- Yo.
- Hey, Paul.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.856
Hey.
It's Lisa Cohen.

46:58.524 --> 46:59.650
Yeah, how's it going?

47:00.401 --> 47:02.824
Okay. What have
you been up to?

47:04.739 --> 47:06.787
Seeing some
questionable movies,

47:06.907 --> 47:08.955
and not deciding
where to go to college.

47:09.035 --> 47:10.287
Sounds good.

47:13.122 --> 47:14.999
So, I was just thinking...

47:16.917 --> 47:18.965
This is gonna
sound really queer,

47:20.046 --> 47:21.969
but by any chance would you
want to meet somewhere

47:22.048 --> 47:24.176
and, like, take away
my virginity?

47:25.760 --> 47:27.262
Um... All right.

47:28.387 --> 47:29.388
Really?

47:29.764 --> 47:32.187
To what do I owe this
inconceivable honor?

47:32.683 --> 47:34.185
Actually, it's because
of my deep,

47:34.310 --> 47:35.857
passionate feelings
for you, Paul.

47:36.437 --> 47:38.314
That's pretty
much what I figured.

47:39.482 --> 47:41.359
Do you wanna give
me your address?

47:41.692 --> 47:42.693
Oh, um...

47:43.736 --> 47:45.864
It's 252 West 85th Street.

47:46.781 --> 47:47.782
Okay.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.294
All right. I'll be
there in like a half hour,

47:53.537 --> 47:54.789
or more.
Okay.

47:54.914 --> 47:56.791
All right. I'll see you. Bye.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.030
- Hello?
- Hey.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.148
What are you up to?

48:21.232 --> 48:22.404
Writing my Lear paper.

48:22.817 --> 48:24.069
That's impressive.

48:24.151 --> 48:25.323
Not really.

48:25.986 --> 48:27.363
I've just never
known you to be

48:27.488 --> 48:28.910
so devoted to
your studies before.

48:29.490 --> 48:30.787
So, what did you do tonight?

48:31.867 --> 48:37.624
Actually, Darren, I don't really
feel like talking right now.

48:38.999 --> 48:40.000
Okay.

48:40.668 --> 48:41.669
Okay?

48:43.587 --> 48:45.806
Yeah. I'll talk
to you later.

48:46.424 --> 48:47.425
Okay.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.516
Okay, bye.
Bye.

49:11.907 --> 49:12.908
Hey.

49:12.992 --> 49:13.993
Hey, come in.

49:19.165 --> 49:20.667
I think I just
alienated one of

49:20.791 --> 49:22.293
your neighbors by
smoking in the elevator.

49:22.418 --> 49:23.419
Really? What
did they say?

49:24.420 --> 49:27.139
She basically said there was
no smoking in the elevator.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.716
That's original.

49:32.803 --> 49:33.804
So, this is the living room.

49:35.556 --> 49:37.229
Very livable.
We like it.

49:38.726 --> 49:41.570
My mom hasn't read any of
these books, by the way.

49:41.729 --> 49:42.730
Have you?

49:43.314 --> 49:45.487
Some of them.
Not all of them.

49:46.817 --> 49:49.115
This book is
a very cool book.

49:49.945 --> 49:54.166
Yeah, I think The Third Reich may be a
little bit too much for me right now.

49:54.992 --> 49:57.461
It's pretty hard to put down
once you get started.

50:00.956 --> 50:02.424
Do you want
anything to drink?

50:03.292 --> 50:04.589
I'd take a beer.

50:08.255 --> 50:09.802
Okay, that's
in the kitchen.

50:27.566 --> 50:30.615
This is my room.
Ta-da.

50:30.986 --> 50:31.987
Very nice.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.043
These are some
drawings I did.

50:37.785 --> 50:40.129
Not that I should be
showing them to you, because

50:40.204 --> 50:42.298
I know you're like a really
good artist, right?

50:42.748 --> 50:44.842
I would like to be
a really good artist.

50:44.917 --> 50:46.419
At this point, I think
it would be more

50:46.544 --> 50:48.091
accurate to say
I'm good at drawing.

50:48.629 --> 50:52.600
Yeah, I just do it for fun. But
I've always really liked it.

50:58.138 --> 50:59.139
So, can I ask
you something?

50:59.306 --> 51:00.307
Yes?

51:02.142 --> 51:04.816
This is probably gonna sound
very immature,

51:05.938 --> 51:09.488
but how can you be so relaxed,
knowing what we're about to do?

51:11.485 --> 51:13.408
Or is it just like
no big deal to you?

51:16.615 --> 51:18.538
Okay, that was
a really stupid question,

51:18.659 --> 51:20.627
and I'm totally
embarrassed right now.

51:20.703 --> 51:23.673
I'm actually more embarrassed
than I've ever been in my life.

51:23.831 --> 51:26.380
If you wanna go home now,
that's totally okay.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.131
Easy there.
Don't be embarrassed.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.755
It's basically, like,
the world's greatest activity,

51:30.838 --> 51:33.011
but it's not actually worth
getting nervous about.

51:33.757 --> 51:37.682
Yeah, I don't usually get nervous
because I think it's worth it,

51:38.387 --> 51:41.266
I usually get nervous because
I can't help the way I feel.

51:42.558 --> 51:44.026
There is that philosophy.

51:45.936 --> 51:47.233
You are so funny.

51:47.646 --> 51:48.647
Do you have an ashtray?

51:49.481 --> 51:51.074
You can just chuck
it out the window.

51:57.031 --> 51:59.375
How would one just
chuck it out the window?

51:59.533 --> 52:02.082
Oh, you just slide
the little door...

52:10.294 --> 52:11.295
Like that?

52:12.338 --> 52:13.510
Yes.

52:14.757 --> 52:16.680
Am I supposed to go really
fast at the end or something?

52:17.092 --> 52:20.312
Yeah, but we're gonna
move on before that.

52:22.264 --> 52:23.265
Here.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.876
Oh, oh. You don't
have to do that.

52:44.078 --> 52:45.500
I know.
I want to.

52:53.671 --> 52:57.426
But don't do that.
I'm just embarrassed.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.059
Let me do it to you.

53:00.177 --> 53:01.429
All right.

53:10.062 --> 53:12.406
Um...

53:13.107 --> 53:14.450
Any general guidelines?

53:14.525 --> 53:16.118
Just be careful.

53:17.194 --> 53:18.195
Okay.

53:24.785 --> 53:26.082
Are you ready?

53:28.956 --> 53:29.957
Yeah.

53:31.166 --> 53:32.167
Okay.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.637
Now, this is a little tricky. It's
probably gonna hurt a little at first,

53:35.921 --> 53:38.299
but then it's gonna get better.
Just be patient.

53:39.299 --> 53:40.926
There are certain
technical difficulties on

53:41.009 --> 53:42.101
my end that have
to be addressed,

53:42.177 --> 53:43.645
or it's not gonna happen.

53:44.972 --> 53:48.226
Okay. You sound
insane.

53:52.187 --> 53:53.188
Okay, ready?

53:54.481 --> 53:55.573
Yeah.

53:56.984 --> 53:58.156
Okay.

53:58.944 --> 54:00.116
Mmm-hmm.

54:00.738 --> 54:01.739
Okay, hang on.

54:02.656 --> 54:03.657
Okay, there we go.

54:04.491 --> 54:05.492
Does it hurt now?

54:06.034 --> 54:07.035
Kind of, yeah.

54:07.244 --> 54:09.918
Okay, just try to relax. It'll
get better in a second...

54:10.998 --> 54:11.999
Did you bring a condom?

54:12.124 --> 54:13.125
- huh.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.672
Shouldn't you put it on?

54:14.835 --> 54:16.007
I will in a second.

54:17.838 --> 54:19.055
This is really
kind of hurting.

54:19.173 --> 54:20.390
Okay, one second.

54:21.675 --> 54:23.097
I love you.
What?

54:23.385 --> 54:24.511
Nothing.

54:24.887 --> 54:26.855
Okay. Hold on.

54:27.389 --> 54:28.936
Shit.
What?

54:29.057 --> 54:32.061
Okay, one second.
Oh! Sorry.

54:33.353 --> 54:34.445
Sorry.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.035
Oh!

54:43.030 --> 54:44.282
Sorry about that.

54:45.532 --> 54:47.534
Kind of got away from me.

54:50.204 --> 54:51.922
Did any of it
get inside me?

54:52.039 --> 54:53.757
I don't know.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.425
Yeah.
It definitely did.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.223
Honest to God,
it's probably okay.

55:05.302 --> 55:07.270
The odds are overwhelmingly
that it's okay.

55:11.391 --> 55:12.392
That's my little brother.

55:18.273 --> 55:19.320
Hey, Curtis.
Hi.

55:56.061 --> 55:58.063
I loved it.
It was so exciting.

55:58.522 --> 56:02.277
But how about those people
yelling "bravi" and "brave"?

56:02.609 --> 56:03.781
How do you mean?

56:03.944 --> 56:05.116
Well, it's just
so pretentious.

56:05.237 --> 56:08.582
"Bravi, bravi." Why can't
they just say "bravo"?

56:08.991 --> 56:12.837
Well, it's the plural. It's what they
say to acknowledge the ensemble.

56:12.953 --> 56:16.378
No, I know it's correct, but don't
you think there's just something

56:16.456 --> 56:18.458
a little pretentious
about some of those people?

56:18.792 --> 56:20.135
Pretentious?

56:20.294 --> 56:21.671
I don't mean they
didn't really enjoy it,

56:22.087 --> 56:24.215
but you know how you can
be enjoying something,

56:24.298 --> 56:26.892
but you're also kind of looking around,
out of the corner of your eye,

56:27.009 --> 56:29.103
because you know people are
watching you enjoy it?

56:29.803 --> 56:33.603
Yes, but I wouldn't say
that it was pretentious.

56:34.141 --> 56:38.317
In Italian you say "bravo" for the
man and "brava" for the woman,

56:38.645 --> 56:40.522
and "bravi" for
the whole company.

56:40.814 --> 56:42.612
- huh. Okay, I see
what you mean.

56:42.816 --> 56:46.161
You use the masculine
for the male singer

56:46.612 --> 56:50.492
and the feminine
for the female singer.

56:50.574 --> 56:52.497
Anyway, I really enjoyed it.
Thank you.

56:54.077 --> 56:55.670
We'll have to go again.

56:55.829 --> 56:57.627
It was so glamorous.

57:00.876 --> 57:03.049
Accident Investigation,
Detective Mitchell.

57:03.128 --> 57:05.347
My name is Lisa Cohen.
I was a witness

57:05.464 --> 57:07.637
in a bus accident
case a few weeks ago.

57:07.716 --> 57:09.764
Yeah, hi, Lisa.
What can I do for you?

57:09.843 --> 57:11.516
Well, are you
allowed to tell me how

57:11.678 --> 57:13.396
to get in touch with
that woman's family?

57:13.597 --> 57:16.271
I really wanted to send
some flowers or something,

57:16.683 --> 57:19.687
or is that like
classified information?

57:19.937 --> 57:23.692
No, the family's been notified.
Let me see what I got.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.614
She mentioned
she had a daughter.

57:25.692 --> 57:28.115
Just hold on a second.
How are you doing, okay?

57:28.195 --> 57:29.196
I'm okay.

57:42.250 --> 57:43.843
All right, let me just...

57:48.340 --> 57:50.718
Okay, I don't have
anything for a daughter.

57:51.176 --> 57:55.773
The only contact I have is
a cousin, Abigail Berwitz.

57:56.306 --> 57:57.899
I got a phone
number in Arizona.

57:57.975 --> 57:58.976
Okay.

57:59.059 --> 58:02.563
520-5555.
Mmm-hmm.

58:03.063 --> 58:04.815
I'm trying to
reach Abigail Berwitz?

58:05.148 --> 58:07.071
This is Abigail.
Hi.

58:09.820 --> 58:13.165
My name is Lisa Cohen.
You don't know me.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.709
Yes? Hello?

58:15.909 --> 58:18.753
I'm actually calling about
your cousin, Monica Patterson?

58:19.496 --> 58:20.748
Okay?

58:22.582 --> 58:23.583
Um...

58:24.710 --> 58:26.929
I was actually
there when she had...

58:28.380 --> 58:30.758
During the accident,
I didn't know her,

58:31.091 --> 58:33.765
but I was holding
her hand at the time.

58:34.261 --> 58:36.855
Yes? What can I do
for you?

58:41.059 --> 58:42.311
Um...

58:42.394 --> 58:43.941
Okay, well...

58:44.479 --> 58:46.072
I saw her obituary
in the paper,

58:46.189 --> 58:47.782
but can you hold
on one second?

58:48.859 --> 58:50.532
Can you shut
up for five minutes?

58:50.610 --> 58:52.578
What am I supposed to do?
I have to practice.

58:52.654 --> 58:53.655
I don't give a shit!

58:54.823 --> 58:56.666
Sorry. Um...

58:57.617 --> 59:00.871
I didn't see anything about a funeral.
I assume they had one.

59:00.954 --> 59:02.126
As far as I know,
they're doing

59:02.247 --> 59:03.419
something or other
next week, but...

59:03.707 --> 59:05.505
I'm sorry,
I was also wondering...

59:06.668 --> 59:08.045
She said something
about her daughter?

59:08.128 --> 59:09.755
No. She wanted someone
to get in touch...

59:09.921 --> 59:13.050
No. Her daughter's not alive. She
passed away quite a long time ago.

59:13.467 --> 59:14.764
Oh, my God.

59:16.136 --> 59:17.558
Was she sick?
Or was it...

59:17.679 --> 59:19.147
She had leukemia.

59:19.931 --> 59:21.308
Oh, my gosh.
Mmm-hmm.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.315
And do you mind if I ask...
Could I just interrupt?

59:24.436 --> 59:26.564
How did you get this number?
This is harassment!

59:26.646 --> 59:28.239
I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to harass you.

59:28.315 --> 59:29.612
I've been getting
calls about this

59:29.691 --> 59:32.194
for three weeks,
and I gotta tell you people,

59:32.277 --> 59:35.702
I didn't have any kind of
relationship with Monica whatsoever.

59:35.822 --> 59:37.745
The person you
should be calling is

59:37.866 --> 59:39.834
Emily Morrison,
who was Monica's friend.

59:39.910 --> 59:42.208
She's the person who's been dealing
with all of this in New York.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.710
It has nothing
to do with me.

59:44.873 --> 59:46.841
I'm sorry! I didn't really
know who to contact.

59:46.917 --> 59:47.918
Now, I can give you
her number,

59:48.001 --> 59:51.005
but I would very much appreciate
it if the calls would stop.

59:51.838 --> 59:52.839
Yeah...

59:54.841 --> 59:56.013
Can you hold on
while I get a pen?

59:56.176 --> 59:57.348
Yes.

59:57.511 --> 59:58.854
All right.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.098
Okay.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.907
Hi, are you Lisa?

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:18.990
Yes.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:29.759
As most of you know,

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:33.555
Monica was not
a religious woman.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:36.012
Anybody who ever
had to sit through

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.885
a wedding or
a funeral with her

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:41.346
knows how she felt about
formal occasions.

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:44.891
So Harry, Elise and I,

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.690
we were talking about this,

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.397
decided we would
just have everyone over,

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:54.743
and let anyone who wanted to talk
about Monica, just talk about her.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.155
Maybe share some remembrances.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:05.996
Some of us know each other
and some of us don't.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.878
But we're all here...

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.344
We're all here
because we loved Monica

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.515
and because we want to pay
tribute to her in a way

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.635
that might conceivably
not enrage her.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:27.977
Now, I don't wanna tell anyone
what to think, or how to feel.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.817
And I don't want
to kid myself about

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:33.524
the stupid, meaningless
way that she died,

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.201
because that would really
make her throw up,

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:39.412
but I don't want it to become
the summation of her life,

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:40.784
because it's not.

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:43.791
When her Lisa died...

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.751
When her Lisa died, I said to
her, "How can you stand it?"

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.753
And she said,
"First of all, I can't.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:55.262
"But I don't want to take away
the 12 years she did have

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:59.183
"and turn them all into leukemia,
because they weren't."

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.555
And so I do think
it's important to remember

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:09.852
that despite the fact
that she got ripped off,

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:13.572
she was the most
fully developed person

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:16.116
I, personally,
have ever known.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.533
She was also impossible
to get along with,

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.208
but that's another story.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:30.163
So, now I've said
my little piece.

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:34.752
And now I want to talk a bit about
the first time we ever met.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.137
She was... She was 21.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.517
It's okay, Emily.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.607
I know.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.397
I was 19.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.313
Even though I realize
it's impossible for my

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.565
children to believe
I was ever that young.

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:44.738
Hi, Dad.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.915
Yeah, hi,
how're you doing?

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.283
Okay, how are you?

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:51.127
I'm just sitting
here listening to some

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.918
music, having
a delicious glass of beer.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:54.998
That sounds pleasant.

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:59.716
Yeah. How's everything going?
How's the boyfriend situation?

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.799
Well, there's this one guy I sort
of had something going with, but...

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.012
But he kind of has
a girlfriend, so...

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.092
- huh.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.479
I realize I'm
incredibly enthralling.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:10.931
You are. You're very lucky.
You're a very

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.519
beautiful girl,
and you've got brains.

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:13.600
That makes you
a little dangerous.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:14.684
Don't forget mature.

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:16.899
Well, I hope you're
not too mature.

01:04:16.978 --> 01:04:18.321
No, don't worry.

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:19.781
Good. That was
a very good answer.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:23.197
Anyway, I do think it's a pretty
longstanding relationship.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:25.495
Then you know what?
You just do nothing.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:27.660
Do absolutely nothing.
And I guarantee

01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:29.783
you one of two
things will happen.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.743
Either you're
going to get the guy to

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.745
start doing back flips
to get your attention

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:35.205
or you're going send
him a crystal clear

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.707
signal that if he
doesn't do back flips,

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.508
he's not gonna
get your attention.

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:40.343
I think he already
knows I like him.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.961
- huh? Okay...

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:43.971
I think I might have spilled
the beans on that one.

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:46.683
That's okay, because now,
if you stop acknowledging him,

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:47.759
if you suddenly
give him nothing,

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.890
I guarantee you, the guy
is going to go berserk

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.556
and forget his girlfriend,
unless he's just not interested.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.392
In which case, you just gotta
take your lumps, which is tough.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.102
Okay, thanks, Dad.
I'll be sure to try out

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.729
the technique
next time I see him.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:01.819
Well, everything's
okay here.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.696
Things are a little slow, but...
Actually, Dad?

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.242
Yeah?

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:10.115
I actually have something kind of
serious I want to ask you about.

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:11.282
Okay.

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:14.795
I'm kind soliciting people I
respect for their views on this.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.167
Okay, what's up?

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.980
Do you think I should go
back to the police, or what?

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:42.735
Well, first of all, I'm very
glad you told me about this.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.113
I want you to let me call
my friend who's a lawyer,

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.489
just so we can find out what some
of the ramifications would be.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:51.081
Maybe the three of us could talk
on the phone and possibly...

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.123
Hey.
Hey, babe.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:53.290
Actually, Dad, please
don't call anybody.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:54.868
Did you get my message?

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.540
Um... I got a message.

01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.295
- Hello?
- Sorry.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:05:59.793
About the flowers
for my mother?

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:02.092
Just one second. Annette just walked in.
I'm sorry.

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:03.168
That's okay.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:04.548
Who are you talking to?

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:06.213
I guess I would
just like to know later

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:07.680
that I would have
done the right thing

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.302
by myself, if you
see what I mean,

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:11.893
because I don't think I have so far.
- huh.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.720
Not that I'm trying to make
this woman's horrible death

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.771
into my own personal
moral gymnasium...

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:18.066
Right. Well, that's
that Shaw quote, right?

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:19.772
What?

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:20.940
The Shaw quote?
That great Shaw quote.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.153
"The Englishman sees
the world as expressly

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:28.576
"designed to be his own
personal moral gymnasium."

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.904
I think it's in one of those
wonderful prefaces.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:32.656
I don't know
where I read it.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.411
Who is that?
It's Lisa.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.954
Oh, good. Will you
please ask her...

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.627
Anyway-...

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.371
Hold on.
I'm sorry, Lisa.

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:40.455
Can you hold on
one second?

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:41.961
Yes?

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.633
Please ask if there's
anything we don't know about

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.085
that she won't eat,
for the trip.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.595
I have to call the ranch
because they do all the meals

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.967
- ahead of time.
- Okay, I will.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:50.848
I really will. We're just
in the middle of something.

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:52.642
Karl, I was supposed
to call them last week.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:53.969
You said you were
going to call her.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.304
If I hear about this
fucking ranch one more

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:56.933
time, I'm going to
blow my brains out.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:59.148
I'm just in the middle
of something.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.482
I don't...
What do you want me to do?

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.815
Fine, but if they put anything
in the baskets she can't eat,

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:04.612
well she's not going
to have anything to eat.

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.734
I will ask her...

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:06.902
The last time
she came out here,

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.824
we went to three different
restaurants and she...

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.494
I will ask her. We're just right
in the middle of something, okay?

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:14.285
Okay. Tell her
I said, "Hi."

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.744
I will. Okay.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:18.789
Hello?

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.335
Yes. Hi.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.425
Mom?

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.085
Monica!

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.242
There's
somebody here to see you.

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:06.665
Hi.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.256
I'm really sorry
to bother you.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:13.209
We never met.
I'm Lisa Cohen.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.679
Yeah. What can
I do for you?

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:20.683
Well, do you remember me
from the bus accident?

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.394
I don't know.
What's this about?

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.601
Would it be okay if I
talked to you for a minute?

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:29.400
What do you want to talk about?
I don't understand.

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:32.817
I just wanna talk about the
accident for a minute.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.574
I don't want anything, and I'm
not here to do anything bad.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.151
I just wanted to
talk to you about it.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.453
Where did you
get my address?

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:43.748
I called information.
I was gonna call first, but...

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:46.243
It would have been better.
We're about to sit down.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:49.954
I don't get what...

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:53.587
All right.
Let's go outside.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.092
I'm sorry. Could I
use your bathroom?

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.169
No, let's just
go outside.

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:57.336
Gerry, let her
use the bathroom.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.592
I don't want her
to use the bathroom.

01:10:58.713 --> 01:10:59.930
I don't understand
what this is.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:01.007
It's right down
the hall, honey.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:04.560
Hey, will you kids settle down, please?
I'm not kidding!

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:07.188
What's the matter with you?
Who is she?

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:08.643
Some girl that
was at the accident.

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:11.442
Nothing is the matter. I let
her use the fucking bathroom.

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:12.518
Who is she?

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.356
Honey, just do me
a favor and wait inside.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.774
No, I want to hear
what this is.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:18.858
Look, we're just...

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:20.986
Okay. What?

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:25.156
Okay.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.164
I hope this isn't going
to insult you too much.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.832
Insult me?

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:35.333
I was just wondering if you felt
bad at all about what happened.

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:38.052
About the accident?
Yeah.

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:41.431
Honey? Are you just upset
about the accident?

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:42.974
Yes! I'm upset
about the accident.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.592
I'm very upset
about the accident.

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:46.552
And I wanted to talk to you
about it for a minute.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:47.975
Why is that
so strange?

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.180
Gerry, why don't
we all go inside?

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.431
Could I please
talk to you alone?

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:53.230
Okay, what is
going on here?

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.903
Nothing's going on here.
So why don't you calm down?

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.902
Look, go ahead inside. Let
me find out what this is.

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:00.404
In the meantime, why
don't you make sure

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:02.906
those kids aren't killing
each other, all right?

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:04.237
All right.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:08.659
No, you know what? Let 'em kill each other.
Give us all a rest.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.293
All right, Lisa.
What?

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.335
I just...

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:23.844
Well... I just want you to know...
Yes? What? Speak.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:28.436
Well, you probably already
know, obviously, that

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.893
I told the police,
on the police report,

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:33.350
that I thought the whole
thing was an accident.

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:35.150
- huh. Right. Because
it was an accident.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:36.978
Well, I mean...

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:39.484
I know you didn't
do it on purpose.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:40.731
"O" Purpose"?

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:41.983
But it wasn't like...

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:46.993
What? What?
Speak. What?

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.287
Well, I mean...

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:52.877
We were looking
at each other.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:56.585
Who was looking at each other'?
You and me?

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:58.795
Well, yeah.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:03.050
I mean, not like
romantically or anything.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.759
Romantically?

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.474
Scratch that. That's
not even relevant.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:09.890
You're not coming through
very clearly here.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:10.970
If you could
just let me...

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:14.725
From my point of view, the way
I remember the accident is

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.686
you were wearing
this cowboy hat,

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:20.233
and I was out that
day to buy a cowboy hat,

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:22.190
so I was waving at you,
because you were wearing one,

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:25.197
and you were
kind of waving back.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.402
And...

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.703
I know I was
distracting you,

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:34.665
but I did see the bus
go through the red light,

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.588
and that's when
it hit that woman.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.083
Okay.

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:43.340
I'm getting
a little confused here.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:44.674
Only nobody said
that to them,

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:47.639
and I wanted to acknowledge with
you that that's what happened.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:49.217
I don't know what you really
mean by "waving at you."

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.722
Were you trying
to catch the bus?

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:52.265
No. Yes.
But I wanted to

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:53.392
ask you about
your cowboy hat.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:54.472
Maybe I was
waving at you,

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:57.274
like waving at you to say,
"Step away from the bus."

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:58.772
Because if the bus
was in motion,

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:00.194
I would be waving
you away for your own

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:01.608
safety, but that's all
that would be.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:04.024
You don't remember looking
at me and waving at me?

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:05.946
Not really. No.

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:09.370
Well, I think we both remember
something different.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.452
Your brother's
on the phone.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.204
Tell him I'll call
him back.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.752
I'm not trying to
get you in trouble.

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:22.253
I know you're not,
because you can't,

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.877
because I didn't
do anything wrong.

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:26.053
There was no
criminality found.

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:28.010
That's it.
The report is final.

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.136
So you're just
gonna leave it?

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.842
I'm gonna leave it
because that's all it was.

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:33.306
If something
else had happened,

01:14:33.427 --> 01:14:34.895
I'd take that to
whatever that was.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.644
It was tragic.
It's a tragedy.

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:39.475
But there's only a certain speed
that those brakes can react.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.856
That's the physical
limitation of the machine.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:45.691
I don't know what else to tell you.
It's shocking. It was a shock.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:49.277
But you can't bring her back.
You cannot bring her back.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.828
I'm not talking about
bringing her back.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.246
I'm talking about
telling the accident

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:53.782
investigators
what really happened.

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:55.036
You already talked
to them!

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:56.208
I know that.
But I lied.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.417
You lied.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.791
I can understand if you don't
want to get in trouble, but...

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.543
Why didn't you
say that right then?

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:02.916
Because when they were
asking me what happened

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.592
it seemed like you
were looking at me

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:06.256
like we were
saying to each other,

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.258
"Let's not say anything
about what happened."

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:10.139
Now, I really don't know
what you're talking' about.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:11.761
I can't prove you
were doing that.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:16.061
- What, did I say something to you?
-  Did I threaten you?

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:18.606
No! I am not blaming
you for any of this!

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:21.397
All I'm saying is I didn't really
tell the cops what happened,

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:23.477
and I didn't want to go back without
having spoken to you first.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:27.031
But you told 'em what
you saw! And so did I!

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:29.950
Only I'm the one driving the bus!
I'm the one behind the wheel!

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.448
All right, Gerry, calm down.
Leave it alone.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.154
You wanna ruin my life?

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.536
Start telling them
about looks and you

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:37.374
waved at me and I
had my cowboy hat on.

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:38.542
Go ahead, but
you're gonna go home

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:39.751
and you're gonna
do your homework,

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:43.331
and I'm gonna lose my job. And who's
gonna take care of my family'?

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:44.457
You?

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:48.048
Are you gonna do it?
And for what?

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.216
She's dead! Okay? She's dead!
And there's

01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:51.714
nothing I can do
to bring her back!

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.049
I just want to say
what really happened.

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.975
You do whatever you
fucking' want, lady!

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.473
But those cops are
gonna laugh in your

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.057
fucking face because
this was not my fault!

01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.434
It was both our fault.

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.390
Don't ever say that again unless
you got a fuckin' lawyer.

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:03.146
What's your
phone number?

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:04.393
Why?

01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:06.150
Give me your number.
No! Why do you want it?

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:08.356
You wanna show up at my house
like some anonymous person

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:10.783
I can't get in touch with? What's
your fuckin' number, Lisa Cohen!

01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:12.110
Gerry, take it easy.

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.451
Fine!
It's 212-5...

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.905
Hold on! Go on.

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:20.789
555-0157. Why do you
need it?

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.212
You do whatever you're gonna do.
I hope you get a good lawyer.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:25.414
Why are you being like this?

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:26.624
This was very
traumatic for him!

01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:29.047
Yeah, it's almost as bad as
getting your leg cutoff!

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:37.014
I don't understand.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:49.568
I guess I was afraid.
I didn't know what to do.

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:51.861
You didn't know
what to do?

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:57.201
I know it doesn't
sound very impressive.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:59.039
Impressive!

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:06.543
Okay, I know you're trying
to do the right thing now.

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:08.336
What does your
mother say?

01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:10.213
My mother hasn't
really been that helpful.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:11.423
What do you mean?

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:12.591
She's got a lot
going on right now

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:15.264
and she hasn't been
that interested, I guess.

01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:20.307
What could she possibly
have going on?

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:21.512
Her show's opening.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:22.763
What do you mean,
"her show"?

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.474
What show?

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.142
She's in a play.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.777
Okay. Okay.

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.788
I'm gonna talk to a friend
of mine who's a lawyer,

01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:41.411
and you're gonna go
talk to the police.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.833
Do you want me
to go with you?

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.293
No, thanks.

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:47.254
Do you think maybe you should
ask your mother to go with you?

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.341
I think I can
handle this part myself.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:54.258
She's been
so suspicious lately.

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:56.843
I don't know how to get her
into the office without...

01:17:57.464 --> 01:17:58.761
Now, what do you think?

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.349
Hey! Let me tell
you something, Eliot.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.351
You want to fire me, go ahead and fire me.
Only don't tiptoe around me

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:10.027
like some kind of
deranged ballerina

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:11.771
every time I see you
in the fucking hall!

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:14.657
Now, do you have anything
to say to me, Eliot?

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:16.734
Um...

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.656
You're not fired?

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.289
Oh.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.992
So... What are you
guys talking about?

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:29.963
A suicide bomber attempted

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.258
to set off a blast
Wednesday in Jerusalem.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.418
No, Lisa read
it to me.

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:38.297
No. I never read 'em unless I know for
sure there's nothing bad in them.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:40.975
WW, do you?

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.928
Well, you're brave
and stupid.

01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:45.679
Um...

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.728
Victor, I wish you wouldn't
talk that way to me.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:50.309
You know I'm...

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:55.072
Spring and Fall, to a Young
Child by Gerard Manley Hopkins.

01:18:57.191 --> 01:19:01.367
"Margaret, are you grieving
Over Goldengrove unleaving?

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:05.454
"Leaves,like
the things of man,

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:09.036
"You with your fresh
thoughts care for, can you?

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.459
"As the heart grows older

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:17.754
"it will come to such sights
colder By and by, nor spare a sigh

01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:21.595
"Though worlds of
wanwood leaf meal lie,

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:25.804
"And yet you will
weep and know why.

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:29.853
"Now no matter,
child, the name:

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:32.852
"Sorrow's
springs are the same.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:37.570
"Nor mouth had,
no nor mind, expressed

01:19:37.648 --> 01:19:41.152
"What heart heard of,

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:45.285
"it is the blight
man was born for,

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:49.452
"it is Margaret
you mourn for."

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:54.214
Any thoughts?

01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:57.714
Lisa?

01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:21.401
Could I help you?

01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:24.574
Yeah, is Detective
Mitchell here?

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:26.239
No, he's not.
Oh.

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:30.417
I talked to him on Monday and he
said he'd be here after 3:00.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:31.493
Yeah, he's
not back yet.

01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.246
Could I help you
with something?

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:35.714
Um...

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:39.293
Well, do you know
when you expect him?

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:41.800
What's this about?

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.139
I was involved in an
accident a few weeks ago,

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.258
and I filled out a report
with Detective Mitchell,

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:47.969
but I wanted to
amend the report...

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:50.396
What do you mean?
How do you want to amend it?

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.265
There was something
I didn't tell him,

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:53.857
and I wanted to
tell him because...

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:54.933
I don't understand.

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:56.940
You wanna change your statement?
Yes!

01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:59.154
Yes, I want to
change my statement.

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:00.773
Yes.

01:21:01.065 --> 01:21:02.863
Well, you'd usually
have to talk to

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:05.031
the investigating
detective on the case.

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:08.580
Yes, I know. That's why I asked
to see Detective Mitchell.

01:21:08.655 --> 01:21:10.532
Who said he'd be here now,
but he's not, so...

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:11.617
Do you remember
the case number?

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:12.785
No, sorry.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.163
It was that woman,
Monica Patterson,

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:17.840
who got run over by
the bus on Broadway.

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:20.209
It was in a lot of the newspapers...
Sure, okay, sit down.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:21.293
Thank you. I...

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:22.378
You know the case is closed.

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:26.723
I assumed it was. But part
of the reason it's closed is

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.221
because of my statement,
and the statement I...

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.472
Because of your statement?

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:30.719
Yes.

01:21:30.928 --> 01:21:32.896
What do you mean it was closed
because of your statement'?

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:34.314
I mean, I was the...

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:35.816
The DA's office
closes the case.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:39.687
You don't close the case. The
DA's office closes the case.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.647
I'm sure it does.
I obviously didn't mean

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.691
I personally closed
it, like legally.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:46.072
I meant what I said was
probably instrumental in

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:47.698
getting the case closed...
What's your name, honey?

01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:50.493
Lisa Cohen.

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:51.657
Okay.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.741
Don't call me
"honey," okay?

01:21:56.537 --> 01:21:57.538
Okay.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.338
Are you not gonna help me
now that I've said that?

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.752
Look, what's your name?

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:04.128
Lisa Cohen!

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:06.714
Okay, Lisa, first thing,
you're gonna calm down.

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:08.765
I'm calm right now.
Okay. Just checking.

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:13.679
Second thing... Oh. Here he is,
your knight in shining armor.

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:15.146
This guy giving'
you a hard time?

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:16.356
No.

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:21.111
So now you're saying'
he ran the light.

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:24.690
Yes. He wasn't even
looking at the road.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:27.655
And I was definitely trying
to get his attention.

01:22:27.734 --> 01:22:28.735
Okay.

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:31.322
Well, before we do
anything, Lisa,

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:34.417
anybody will tell you that just
because he ran a red light

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.368
is not a criminal offense.
Even if he kills someone?

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:39.956
Even if you cause an accidental
death, that's right.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.126
Now, in order for it to
be a criminal offense,

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:46.462
the law says you need
two aggravating circumstances.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:50.132
Like he ran a red light
and he was speeding.

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.307
Or he ran a red light and...

01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:52.551
So he's not liable
to be prosecuted

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:55.729
for manslaughter or
2nd degree murder?

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:56.930
No.

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.892
He could be charged
with reckless driving,

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.111
or filling out
a false police report,

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.233
which...
That's no joke...

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:04.442
That's unbelievable!

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.273
What does he have to do?
Kill her on purpose?

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:09.614
Yes. Because that's
the definition of murder.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:12.822
Killing' someone
on purpose.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:16.617
Now, you're not saying' that
he ran her over on purpose.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.078
Are you?

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:24.045
Are you?

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:30.927
No.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.262
Okay, look...

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.229
Let me take
another statement.

01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:43.523
We'll look
into it, okay?

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:44.941
You're kidding.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.610
No. I'll talk it
over with my sergeant,

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.946
probably pull
this guy in again.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.868
Put a little pressure
on him.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:53.537
We'll see what he says.

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:57.449
Thank you!

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:02.379
The Central Park Conservatory,
or whatever it's called,

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:04.206
put up about 500
miles of these cheap,

01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:06.083
shitty-looking
fences all over the park,

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:07.588
which is totally
antithetical to what

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.131
the park was
originally designed for.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:11.305
We are so
gonna miss the game.

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:13.222
Oh, my God,
it's John!

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.557
Hi, John.

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:15.885
Hi, John.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.184
You want
some?

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:25.397
Come on, guys.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:27.939
Come on, you can't be
smoking' a J on your way

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:30.236
to a school
soccer game!

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:33.902
- Now, come on!
- Sorry!

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:36.034
We're really sorry.

01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:46.294
So, how about how he
was like, "smoking' a J"?

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:49.502
Like, "You can't be
smoking' a J."

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:53.215
Like, "Everybody, let's go
over to John's house and smoke a J."

01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:07.019
Hi, Mr. Aaron!

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:08.521
Lisa, how are you?

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:10.026
Pretty damn good.
How are you?

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:12.366
I'm all right.
Tell me something.

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:14.576
Whatever happened
with that situation?

01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:17.700
Oh, I'm working on it. I'll
tell you all about it sometime.

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:19.744
Hey, what kind
of a bike is that?

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:21.208
It's a Trek.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.039
I'm supposed to
take a horseback riding

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:24.874
trip with my father
over Christmas break

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:29.174
and I was wondering, does it bear any
resemblance to riding a bicycle?

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.879
As far as I know, no.

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:35.173
But you must have
ridden a lot of horses.

01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:37.306
What makes you say that?

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:40.886
Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming
or some place like that?

01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:42.767
Some place like what?

01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:44.606
You know,
not New York.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.437
I'm actually from Indiana.

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:49.770
But don't let me overwhelm you
with superfluous details.

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:51.776
God, so what are you doing at
a New York private school

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:56.156
teaching geometry to a bunch of
over-privileged liberal Jews?

01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:00.243
Well... Um...

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:04.827
I came here to be a teacher,
and that's what I'm doing.

01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:06.583
So, would you say
you've reached

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.797
the summit of your
lifelong ambition?

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:15.880
Is that a real question
or is that a Lisa question?

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:17.423
About half and half.

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:18.761
In that case...

01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:19.971
Before you go.

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:22.348
I'm actually thinking about getting
one of these. Can I try it?

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:23.974
Just for a second?

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:26.974
All right.
Thanks.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.773
Here, I'll adjust
the seat for you.

01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:31.520
Thank you.

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.741
Watch my bag?
Yeah.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:54.797
Oh, hi.

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.971
Where've you been? I didn't
know if you wanted dinner.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.469
No, thanks.
I'll order something.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.309
Someone named
Emily called.

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.057
And Detective
Mitchell called from

01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:05.850
the Accident
Investigation Squad.

01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:07.476
Is that that one we met?

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:12.110
What's going on? Did you
ever go back and see him?

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:15.356
I'd rather not talk about it when
you have one foot out the door,

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:16.861
if that's okay.

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:21.695
All right.

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:24.497
I'm gonna go.

01:27:24.614 --> 01:27:25.661
Have a good show.

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:26.867
Thank you.

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:30.787
Dave, Lisa.

01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:32.214
Hi.
How are you?

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:34.958
So...

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:39.259
Lisa, Dave is one
of my best friends.

01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:42.967
He's a terrific lawyer, and if he
doesn't know what to do himself,

01:27:43.049 --> 01:27:45.097
he'll certainly know
someone we can talk to.

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:46.474
Okay, great.

01:27:47.304 --> 01:27:50.183
When someone is killed, it's what's
called a wrongful death suit,

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:53.272
which is a statutory case,
which means there's a statute

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:56.275
passed by a legislature which gives
you the right to bring the case.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.652
As opposed to what?

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:00.117
As opposed to common law,
which is law passed by judges

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:01.739
which is why
the damages are limited.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.240
I don't understand.

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:04.658
Just skip that part.

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.206
We don't care about that.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:08.249
I thought we were trying to get
the police to arrest this guy.

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:09.538
No, the police are
not gonna...

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:10.785
Why not?
They told me

01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:12.086
they were gonna
look into it again.

01:28:12.162 --> 01:28:13.835
I'm just telling you
that even if they do,

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:15.712
there is no way in this world
the police are gonna recommend

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:17.259
to the DA that
they charge this guy.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:18.877
So, what can we do?

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.382
I'm getting to that.
Sorry.

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:21.679
- That's okay.
- That's okay, honey.

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:23.883
I'm just getting
to that.

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.218
You can't do anything
unless you're a relative...

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:30.268
She didn't have any relatives,
except for those idiots in Arizona.

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:33.772
Hang on a minute. Or unless you're
the executor of her estate...

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.648
I am the executor
of her estate.

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:37.567
Which is Emily.
I know.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:40.987
Because the executor
of her estate

01:28:41.107 --> 01:28:42.825
can bring a wrongful
death suit,

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:46.371
but the beneficiary
has to be a relative.

01:28:46.446 --> 01:28:48.289
So let me explain
about that.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:53.500
In a wrongful death suit you can
sue for pain and suffering,

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:56.752
pecuniary losses, loss
of support or services.

01:28:56.832 --> 01:28:59.255
Also what's called
care, comfort and society.

01:28:59.793 --> 01:29:02.842
It's like advice or counseling
of the parent that the kids

01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:03.922
aren't gonna get anymore.

01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:05.056
I don't understand.

01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:07.350
Who are we suing?
The bus driver?

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:09.970
Well, no, because the bus
driver wouldn't have any money.

01:29:10.053 --> 01:29:12.431
You basically sue everybody
and hope something sticks.

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.688
The person who pays will probably
be the MTA's insurance company.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:17.899
But do you think the
driver would get fired?

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:20.155
No. Not necessarily.

01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:22.782
Even if all the facts
came out at the trial?

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:27.328
Maybe. I don't know.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:29.288
But how much could
they be liable for?

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:31.037
It depends...
How badly do you think

01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:32.163
we could ever hurt them?

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:35.621
If she was alive, and in pain
for an extended period of time,

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.714
they give more
money for that.

01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:43.003
I'd say she was
alive for 10 minutes.

01:29:44.254 --> 01:29:46.632
Was she conscious?
Was she awake the whole time?

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.769
I'm sorry, Emily.

01:29:53.179 --> 01:29:55.807
Yeah, awake.

01:29:57.851 --> 01:29:59.103
It's okay.

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:00.528
Well...

01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:04.320
If she was in a lot
of pain for that long,

01:30:05.859 --> 01:30:08.829
I don't know, maybe 300,000,
half a million dollars

01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:10.156
to get a sustainable verdict.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:13.492
A brain damaged baby
would be three million.

01:30:13.867 --> 01:30:17.337
But the truth is, Lisa,
when all is said and done,

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:18.413
it's not a very good case.

01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:19.539
Why not?

01:30:19.706 --> 01:30:21.003
Because it's your
word against his,

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:24.131
and because you already lied
on your first deposition.

01:30:24.628 --> 01:30:27.848
A red light case is a 50-50
proposition already.

01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:31.598
And with only one eyewitness,
with two conflicting statements?

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:34.721
I wouldn't take that case.

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:41.858
Nobody really cares about
getting a lot of money here.

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:43.280
I understand that, but...

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:44.652
We just want this
prick to suffer,

01:30:44.731 --> 01:30:46.324
and we want
the bus company to take

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.034
responsibility
for hiring this guy.

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:50.862
I understand that. But no
matter how you slice it,

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:52.744
the fact that Lisa
lied on her first

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:54.707
statement is a disaster
for your lawyer.

01:30:57.202 --> 01:31:00.672
Can't I explain why I
lied the first time?

01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:03.170
It's not like I'm trying
to get any money for myself.

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:06.632
That's true. She has
no financial interest,

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.179
she can't be
impeached for bias.

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.636
Impeached for what?

01:31:10.924 --> 01:31:13.677
She can't have her credibility
attacked on financial grounds

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.013
because the jury knows you're not
gonna get any money if you win.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:17.393
So that's something,
isn't it?

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:19.816
But do you really think
we know what that means?

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:21.438
I'm sorry. That's what
it's called.

01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:23.111
But who are you
talking to?

01:31:23.395 --> 01:31:25.648
You know we don't
know what that means.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:29.860
It's like you're not really concentrating.
You're not concentrating.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:34.747
I don't know.
I am concentrating.

01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:38.001
I'm just thinking
out loud.

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:39.577
Okay.

01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:43.753
All right.
I'm sorry.

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:47.506
I'm sorry!

01:31:48.128 --> 01:31:50.426
Okay. All right.

01:31:52.048 --> 01:31:54.016
He wasn't always
a lawyer, you know.

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:56.470
He used to be
a very nice, little boy.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:03.768
Anyway-...

01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:04.860
Anyway, the whole
point of this

01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:06.404
is to get...
To fucking get this guy!

01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:09.278
It was to get him out from
behind the wheel of a bus!

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.735
Did she know
she was dying?

01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:19.205
I only ask because
the terror of knowing

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:21.544
you're dying
raises the damages.

01:32:22.412 --> 01:32:25.256
I think she had
a pretty good idea.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:32.301
If she had lived for a couple more
days it would make the case better.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.381
Thank you.

01:32:34.507 --> 01:32:35.850
Thanks.

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:43.308
I know that sounds horrible, but
that's what it comes down to.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.153
We know, Dave.

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:48.646
It's okay.

01:32:55.695 --> 01:33:00.667
I would just like somebody to take
responsibility for what happened.

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:17.426
"As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:20.095
"They kill us
for their sport."

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:24.024
"As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

01:33:25.308 --> 01:33:27.151
"They kill us
for their sport."

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:34.192
What do you make of that?

01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:39.872
Lisa? Lisa?

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:42.541
I don't know.

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:45.871
You know what, Lisa?
That's not good enough.

01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:47.168
That's just not good enough.

01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:49.796
Shakespeare wrote something.
What's your response?

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.798
And don't tell me you don't have
one, 'cause I don't buy it.

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:54.550
I don't really
have a lot to say.

01:33:54.712 --> 01:33:56.680
It seems pretty
self-evident to me.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:01.804
Matthew?

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:02.978
I think it is
self-evident.

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:04.647
I think he's saying
that human beings

01:34:04.764 --> 01:34:06.391
don't mean any
more to the gods

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:09.227
than flies do to little boys who
like to torture them for fun.

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:13.282
As far as the gods are concerned,
we're just ants. Nothing.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:14.899
Darren?

01:34:15.275 --> 01:34:16.367
Thank you, Matthew.

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:20.913
Yeah, I agree.
Only it's

01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:23.624
not Shakespeare
saying it, it's Gloucester.

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.795
Maybe another character would
have a different point of view.

01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:30.290
Okay. That's a valid point.
Just because Shakespeare

01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:32.250
has one of his
characters say something,

01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:34.252
doesn't mean he
personally agrees with it.

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:35.795
Yes, David?

01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:39.262
Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying
the gods don't care about us.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:42.435
Maybe he's saying there's a higher
consciousness that we can't see.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.308
That the gods'
perception of reality

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:46.272
is so much more
developed than ours

01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:47.648
that, compared to
their perception,

01:34:47.724 --> 01:34:50.603
our perceptions are like
comparing flies to boys.

01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:54.606
Okay, I really don't think that
that's what he's getting at.

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:56.566
What I think
he's getting at here

01:34:56.649 --> 01:35:01.280
is a very dark view of the arbitrary
nature of human suffering.

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:02.705
But maybe he's not.

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:05.784
Maybe he's comparing human
consciousness to divine consciousness

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.418
and that even
though it seems to us

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.003
that human suffering
is just arbitrary,

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:12.082
that's just because we're
limited by our viewpoint.

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:15.585
Okay, I...

01:35:15.668 --> 01:35:17.386
I still don't think
that's what he's saying.

01:35:17.462 --> 01:35:20.136
No, like, if you say
they kill us for their sport,

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:22.013
when our perception
of the gods is so meager

01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:24.469
that we can't even
tell what they're doing,

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.054
then how can we be so
arrogant as to think

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:28.231
they'd even bother to
kill us for their sport?

01:35:31.476 --> 01:35:32.728
I don't know.

01:35:35.647 --> 01:35:36.990
Monica?

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:39.864
I don't think that's
what he's saying at all.

01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:43.447
I think he's saying the gods don't
give a shit about human beings

01:35:43.613 --> 01:35:46.617
and that they just like to
kill and torture us for fun.

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:49.745
But if the gods' consciousness is
so much more developed than ours

01:35:49.869 --> 01:35:51.462
that we seem
like flies to them,

01:35:51.537 --> 01:35:53.790
then how can we be sure
what they have in mind for us

01:35:53.873 --> 01:35:55.125
or why they do anything?

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:57.844
Okay, David, I think
you've made your point.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:35:59.424
But it's not what
Shakespeare meant.

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:00.721
Scholarly opinion
is pretty consistent

01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:02.090
that he's trying
to say something...

01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:03.390
Scholarly opinion?

01:36:03.508 --> 01:36:04.725
...about human suffering here.

01:36:04.842 --> 01:36:07.595
What are you saying? 1,000
Frenchmen can't be wrong?

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.722
No, I'm not saying that.
But I would like to move on...

01:36:09.806 --> 01:36:11.308
Well, I think
he is saying that.

01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:13.985
Because he's comparing
human consciousness to flies

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.607
and he's saying we can't
see the truth around us

01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:17.314
because our
consciousness is undeveloped.

01:36:17.397 --> 01:36:21.027
No, David, you're wrong. That's
not what Shakespeare meant.

01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:22.744
He says it somewhere
else in the play,

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:24.362
but I don't want to
get hung up on this,

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:27.198
because that's not
what Shakespeare meant.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.077
I would really
like to move on.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.223
"Poor Tom's a-cold."

01:36:49.387 --> 01:36:50.889
Detective Mitchell.

01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:52.974
Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen
calling.

01:36:53.057 --> 01:36:55.526
Hi, Lisa, what
can I do for you?

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:58.988
I was just wondering whatever
happened, if anything, with the case.

01:36:59.063 --> 01:37:00.906
You said you might
re-interview the bus driver.

01:37:01.024 --> 01:37:03.072
Yes, we did.
We brought him back in.

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.662
You did? What happened?

01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:09.207
Well, he basically stuck by
his original representation

01:37:09.282 --> 01:37:11.410
and that was pretty much it.

01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:14.500
I brought it up with my
sergeant, and he agreed with me

01:37:14.579 --> 01:37:18.049
that we still don't have
enough to charge this guy,

01:37:18.124 --> 01:37:22.129
so there's not a lot more
we can do at this point.

01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:26.011
Well, I'm not trying to tell
you how to do your job,

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:27.592
but how did you
ask the questions?

01:37:28.426 --> 01:37:29.473
Excuse me?

01:37:29.594 --> 01:37:30.641
He's obviously not gonna

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:33.974
change his statement if you just ask
him really politely. Why would he?

01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:35.479
We already know
he's a liar.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.022
Hey, in the old days, Lisa,

01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:39.354
we'd just throw him in the
back room with a rubber hose

01:37:39.437 --> 01:37:41.360
and get whatever answer
we want out of him.

01:37:41.439 --> 01:37:43.658
But, fortunately,
we don't do that anymore.

01:37:43.733 --> 01:37:44.950
Yeah, not to white people.

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:46.573
Excuse me?

01:37:46.652 --> 01:37:49.451
You don't do it to white people.
Anyway, I'm not saying you...

01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:50.907
Wait. We don't
do it to who?

01:37:51.032 --> 01:37:52.284
Oh' my God
Shh!

01:37:52.742 --> 01:37:54.415
First of all,
I don't understand

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:56.253
why you bring this
guy's race into it.

01:37:56.788 --> 01:37:58.165
There's 40,000
cops in this city...

01:37:58.289 --> 01:37:59.666
Yes...

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:03.216
And I hate to disillusion you, but
most of them are pretty good guys

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:04.762
just trying' to do their job.

01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:09.468
Now, the bottom line is the DA
is not gonna take this case.

01:38:10.968 --> 01:38:14.472
Now, you could take it up with my
sergeant if you want to, but he's...

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:15.602
Yes, I would.

01:38:15.681 --> 01:38:17.900
Well, I will patch
you through, then.

01:38:19.602 --> 01:38:22.606
The original decision was
based on false information.

01:38:23.648 --> 01:38:25.616
So what's the point
of even bringing...

01:38:27.402 --> 01:38:29.279
So there's no way
to appeal?

01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:33.746
But how do you know
Detective Mitchell

01:38:33.866 --> 01:38:35.584
interrogated him
aggressively enough

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:37.003
if you weren't there?

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.497
What's going on?

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:44.715
My family is
all there still,

01:38:44.794 --> 01:38:47.263
but Rodrigo is
studying in London,

01:38:50.425 --> 01:38:52.177
and Hector is in Geneva.

01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:53.432
- huh.

01:38:54.095 --> 01:38:56.348
I'm sure they will go back
eventually because

01:38:56.514 --> 01:38:59.609
they will like to do
something for their country.

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:03.188
But it's a worry.
It's very bad there now.

01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:06.150
Yeah? I haven't
really been following it.

01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:11.158
It's a big mess. Last year I
helped to found an organization

01:39:11.237 --> 01:39:15.083
to work with children whose
families have been killed

01:39:15.158 --> 01:39:17.001
or the parents
have been kidnapped.

01:39:18.161 --> 01:39:24.089
We try to find homes for them,
preferably in Colombia,

01:39:24.167 --> 01:39:29.469
because if we lose our
young people, that's it.

01:39:30.381 --> 01:39:32.054
That's the future.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.809
Yeah. I wish I knew
more about it.

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:44.646
You think Lisa would be
interested in acting?

01:39:46.898 --> 01:39:48.115
No. I don't.

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.528
I think she has a lot of
contempt for it, actually.

01:39:52.445 --> 01:39:54.573
Anyway, maybe it's the age.

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:58.998
She would prefer the world
with no plays? No films?

01:39:59.702 --> 01:40:01.579
Oh. Who knows?

01:40:05.374 --> 01:40:09.049
Would you like to see
a picture of my mother?

01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:11.093
Sure.

01:40:11.923 --> 01:40:14.426
These are all my
aunts and uncles.

01:40:14.509 --> 01:40:16.307
See? Big family.
Mmm.

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:11.148
So after I talked to
you guys the other day,

01:43:11.227 --> 01:43:13.355
I called this P.l.
I know to see if he could...

01:43:13.437 --> 01:43:14.609
You called a what?
A what?

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:18.075
Private investigator,
to see if he could

01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:20.160
find anything out
about your bus driver.

01:43:20.236 --> 01:43:21.237
Really?
Yeah.

01:43:21.529 --> 01:43:22.701
Dave! I can't believe
you called...

01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:23.994
Wait, let me tell you
what he said.

01:43:24.073 --> 01:43:25.791
So he calls
someone he knows who

01:43:25.908 --> 01:43:27.626
used to work as
a cop at the MTA.

01:43:28.911 --> 01:43:30.788
And you know the MTA
have their own police?

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:32.373
The MTA police?

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:34.003
They have their
own uniforms...

01:43:34.083 --> 01:43:35.585
Yeah? Yeah?

01:43:35.668 --> 01:43:37.386
Just a minute!
Jesus Christ!

01:43:37.795 --> 01:43:41.971
What the fuck do we care about the
MTA police and their uniforms?

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:47.180
Okay, so this guy gets a look
at your guy's file.

01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:48.685
It turns out he's
had two previous

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:50.641
accidents less
than two years apart.

01:43:50.766 --> 01:43:51.813
What?

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:53.690
But that he's never been
disciplined or cited,

01:43:54.019 --> 01:43:55.441
just moved around
to different shifts.

01:43:55.521 --> 01:43:56.568
Are you kidding me?

01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:57.781
Why does this
not shock me?

01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:59.692
If you read the papers,
you'll know that

01:43:59.775 --> 01:44:01.448
they're going
through a protracted

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:03.116
labor dispute at
the MTA right now.

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.913
And according to my P.l.,

01:44:04.989 --> 01:44:07.993
management doesn't want to aggravate
the situation by firing this guy.

01:44:08.576 --> 01:44:09.919
This is making me sick.

01:44:09.994 --> 01:44:12.247
I know, but what it means,
Lisa, is that we have a case.

01:44:12.371 --> 01:44:14.089
We do?
We can now sue

01:44:14.165 --> 01:44:16.259
for what's called
"negligent retention."

01:44:16.333 --> 01:44:19.086
Which just means they should have
known this guy was a bad risk,

01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:22.674
and they negligently retained him
until, finally, he killed somebody.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.717
You can prove that?
Sure, because

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:27.223
we can just subpoena their
personnel records,

01:44:27.303 --> 01:44:29.852
which we already know
contain damaging information.

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:31.022
But you wouldn't be
our lawyer, right?

01:44:31.182 --> 01:44:32.274
No.

01:44:32.349 --> 01:44:33.350
Why not?

01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:34.518
I'm not a personal
injury litigator.

01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:35.686
It's not his area.

01:44:35.770 --> 01:44:38.319
I don't know enough about it.
I would lose.

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:40.859
But you could
recommend someone?

01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:43.369
Sure, sure.

01:44:44.695 --> 01:44:46.117
I know a very good guy.

01:44:46.197 --> 01:44:49.041
His name is Russel Deutsch.
He's not a sleazebag.

01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:52.040
Very, very experienced.

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:54.543
You gotta get that
crazy cousin on board,

01:44:54.705 --> 01:44:56.378
she's gonna be
your beneficiary.

01:44:56.457 --> 01:44:58.050
She's not gonna want
to come to New York.

01:44:58.375 --> 01:44:59.968
I can tell you that
right now.

01:45:00.586 --> 01:45:05.968
If you win, she stands to get
anywhere from $300,000 to $500,000.

01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:08.178
She's coming to New York.

01:45:08.552 --> 01:45:10.054
You're awesome!

01:45:11.055 --> 01:45:14.309
First thing we do is we file
a summons and a complaint

01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:17.144
against the MTA. They
get 20 days to respond,

01:45:17.478 --> 01:45:20.152
and when they do, we can
make our discovery requests.

01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:22.859
Accident reports, personnel
records, etcetera.

01:45:22.942 --> 01:45:27.038
But now, you gotta realize, this
is going to take some time.

01:45:27.279 --> 01:45:30.783
The law says you have to have
a court date within one year.

01:45:30.908 --> 01:45:33.752
Usually it takes
around six, depending.

01:45:33.828 --> 01:45:34.829
Six years?

01:45:34.912 --> 01:45:35.913
Yes, depending.

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.582
Now, I mentioned
to Dave,

01:45:37.665 --> 01:45:40.589
I have a friend who writes for
the Metro section of The Times.

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:42.762
Yes, now, if it could
really happen,

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:45.014
this changes everything
in our favor.

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:47.217
If they think there's gonna
be adverse publicity,

01:45:47.299 --> 01:45:48.846
especially in
The New York Times,

01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:50.052
they're gonna want
to settle right away,

01:45:50.135 --> 01:45:52.888
as soon as possible,
and as quietly as possible.

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:55.607
So they'd make it a condition
that we didn't...

01:45:55.891 --> 01:45:58.110
It usually works, you get the
money, but you can't talk about it.

01:45:58.435 --> 01:45:59.436
Nobody knows the terms.

01:45:59.645 --> 01:46:01.647
So what good
does that do?

01:46:01.814 --> 01:46:03.441
You get the money.

01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:05.442
Is that bad?

01:46:07.152 --> 01:46:10.656
This is how our society punishes
people for doing bad things.

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:13.375
By getting money from their
employers' insurance companies?

01:46:13.450 --> 01:46:15.748
Yes. It's called
"punitive damages."

01:46:17.496 --> 01:46:20.625
Could we insist they fire the driver?
As part of the settlement?

01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:22.464
Sure, why not?

01:46:22.877 --> 01:46:24.550
Is that something
people do?

01:46:24.628 --> 01:46:25.754
Sure. It's one of
your conditions.

01:46:26.171 --> 01:46:28.970
And you think
we're gonna win?

01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:31.727
They're gonna settle?
Oh, they're gonna settle.

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:42.229
Oh. Hi.

01:46:43.898 --> 01:46:45.150
I want to talk to you.

01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:48.077
I take it that's
my report card?

01:46:48.319 --> 01:46:49.571
It sure is.

01:46:57.328 --> 01:47:00.832
I had a friend who used to
live on this block, at 262?

01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:02.791
Oh.

01:47:02.875 --> 01:47:06.004
That's so nice. Yeah, I
don't know if you know her.

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:08.509
Cheryl Rowan?
She's a physiotherapist?

01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:11.513
No, I don't know her.

01:47:11.592 --> 01:47:13.265
I think about
1,000 people must...

01:47:13.344 --> 01:47:14.516
What?

01:47:15.638 --> 01:47:16.639
Nothing.

01:47:18.474 --> 01:47:20.067
Lisa says you're
in a play, Joan?

01:47:20.184 --> 01:47:21.811
Oh, yeah.

01:47:21.894 --> 01:47:23.612
It's really good,
you should go see it.

01:47:23.687 --> 01:47:27.191
Well, the play is great, and
it has this really nice cast.

01:47:27.358 --> 01:47:30.111
She's being modest. She's
gonna win every award in New York.

01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:32.409
Oh, all that stuff's
a long way off.

01:47:32.988 --> 01:47:34.956
I don't go to
the theater very much.

01:47:35.032 --> 01:47:38.582
No, it's just nice, because you can
work a long time in the theater

01:47:38.661 --> 01:47:42.040
and play a lot of great parts and
not get a lot of recognition.

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:43.749
And even though
you don't necessarily

01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:45.501
do it for that as
your primary motive,

01:47:45.584 --> 01:47:47.632
it is nice when people do
notice something you've done.

01:47:47.711 --> 01:47:48.712
Mmm-hmm.

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:50.844
I was on a television
show a few years ago.

01:47:50.965 --> 01:47:52.638
I'd been doing
theater all my life,

01:47:52.716 --> 01:47:56.220
and suddenly all my relatives
started calling to congratulate me

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:58.146
because they thought I'd finally made it.

01:47:58.222 --> 01:48:00.975
All it was was this dumb show
that paid the bills for a while.

01:48:01.058 --> 01:48:03.186
That show was
so stupid.

01:48:03.268 --> 01:48:05.270
Well, it wasn't
that bad.

01:48:06.939 --> 01:48:09.488
Anyway, I realize this is
horribly embarrassing for Lisa,

01:48:09.692 --> 01:48:12.241
but I just really wanted
to meet you, Emily,

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:16.665
because you've frankly become
such a big part of Lisa's life,

01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:19.209
and I don't want
to be intrusive,

01:48:19.284 --> 01:48:22.413
but this whole court case seems to
be suddenly dominating everything

01:48:22.496 --> 01:48:24.123
and I can't get Lisa to
tell me anything about it.

01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:25.173
That's not true.

01:48:25.249 --> 01:48:26.466
Well, I can't.

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:29.215
I want you
to know, Lisa,

01:48:29.294 --> 01:48:32.173
I'm very, very proud of you for
pursuing this the way that you have.

01:48:32.256 --> 01:48:34.884
But I can't let you
pursue it to the point

01:48:34.967 --> 01:48:36.344
where it's taking
over your life

01:48:36.427 --> 01:48:38.350
or interfering
with your schoolwork.

01:48:38.929 --> 01:48:40.806
See, it's come down to
a question of homework.

01:48:40.889 --> 01:48:43.438
Lisa's on a half
scholarship at her school.

01:48:44.268 --> 01:48:47.397
I know she feels a real sense of
responsibility about what happened.

01:48:47.938 --> 01:48:49.736
Yeah, I do.

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:53.194
I know you do. I know you do. But
you can't not do your homework

01:48:53.277 --> 01:48:55.450
and you can't throw away your
scholarship because of it.

01:48:55.612 --> 01:48:59.116
I'm not. My grades slipped a little.
They'll get better.

01:48:59.408 --> 01:49:02.912
Anyone can do their homework.
You just sit down and do it.

01:49:03.037 --> 01:49:04.960
I've been distracted.
I'll stop.

01:49:06.957 --> 01:49:09.631
All right. We didn't need a
big conference about it.

01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:11.053
It's not a big
conference.

01:49:11.128 --> 01:49:14.632
I just wanted to
know what was going on.

01:49:16.091 --> 01:49:17.718
And I wanted
to meet Emily.

01:49:18.969 --> 01:49:20.812
I know it's
a little awkward.

01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:27.982
Lisa? Do you think Emily
would like to see the play'?

01:49:28.812 --> 01:49:31.691
I thought you could both come, and
then we could go out afterwards.

01:49:31.774 --> 01:49:33.151
All right.
Let me ask her.

01:49:36.195 --> 01:49:37.617
Okay.

01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:40.491
Dig in,
everybody.

01:49:44.828 --> 01:49:46.830
I was thinking about
spending next year with Dad.

01:49:48.624 --> 01:49:50.126
Oh?
Yeah.

01:49:51.126 --> 01:49:52.469
You're worried
about my grades.

01:49:52.544 --> 01:49:54.217
They have really good public
schools in Santa Monica

01:49:54.296 --> 01:49:55.889
and if I officially
lived with him,

01:49:55.964 --> 01:49:57.807
you wouldn't have to worry
about my scholarship.

01:49:59.051 --> 01:50:00.724
Have you talked
to him about this?

01:50:00.844 --> 01:50:02.562
We've had some
general discussions.

01:50:02.638 --> 01:50:04.231
- Do you want to go, too?
- Me?

01:50:04.306 --> 01:50:05.353
Yeah. Do you want
to move to LA, too?

01:50:05.474 --> 01:50:06.521
No.

01:50:06.725 --> 01:50:08.102
Well, let me know
if you do.

01:50:08.185 --> 01:50:09.983
Why are you
being like this?

01:50:10.062 --> 01:50:11.689
Why am I being like what?

01:50:11.814 --> 01:50:13.066
Why are you about
to start crying?

01:50:13.482 --> 01:50:15.325
Because it's your intention
to make me start crying!

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.743
No, it's not.

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.866
You want to move
to LA, move to LA.

01:50:18.987 --> 01:50:20.204
Why can't this
even be mentioned

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.452
without you
taking it personally?

01:50:21.532 --> 01:50:23.455
I'm just introducing a possibility!

01:50:23.534 --> 01:50:26.629
Here's a possibility, that you can
make your own fucking dinner!

01:50:26.703 --> 01:50:28.751
Here's a possibility, that you can
do whatever you want to do...

01:50:28.831 --> 01:50:30.128
Jesus Christ!
What is with you?

01:50:30.207 --> 01:50:31.800
I don't care anymore, you
heartless little fucking bitch!

01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:33.297
Keep it up! This really
makes me want to stay here!

01:50:33.377 --> 01:50:35.129
You think you're
so fucking perfect?

01:50:35.212 --> 01:50:36.213
No!

01:50:39.049 --> 01:50:40.016
Nice one.

01:50:40.092 --> 01:50:41.093
Shut Up!

01:50:43.637 --> 01:50:45.355
Let me tell you
something, Eliot.

01:51:24.094 --> 01:51:26.267
How would you describe
the relationship overall?

01:51:28.849 --> 01:51:31.443
Did you talk on the phone a lot?
Were there a lot of visits?

01:51:31.602 --> 01:51:33.275
I would say we
talked on the phone

01:51:33.395 --> 01:51:35.113
a couple of times
a month, at least.

01:51:35.564 --> 01:51:39.159
Sometimes more than that. I would
call her, she would call me.

01:51:40.277 --> 01:51:43.702
And what were the nature
of the conversations?

01:51:44.031 --> 01:51:48.127
Oh, family stuff, mostly.
Her family, my kids.

01:51:48.785 --> 01:51:51.129
She'd give you advice about your family?
That kind of thing?

01:51:51.330 --> 01:51:53.879
Oh, I would say so, yes.

01:51:54.416 --> 01:51:55.588
Do you have
any phone records?

01:51:55.667 --> 01:51:58.511
I have all my phone bills,
if that's what you mean.

01:51:58.879 --> 01:52:00.847
I didn't record
the actual conversations.

01:52:00.923 --> 01:52:02.049
No, no.

01:52:02.132 --> 01:52:04.885
You'll see we talked on the
phone quite frequently.

01:52:05.177 --> 01:52:07.145
Okay, terrific.
I see you came prepared.

01:52:07.262 --> 01:52:09.185
Well, I wanted
to bring everything.

01:52:09.473 --> 01:52:12.067
Now, when they
take your deposition,

01:52:12.142 --> 01:52:13.985
you're gonna say the same
thing you just told me.

01:52:14.061 --> 01:52:15.358
Just talk about
the relationship.

01:52:15.646 --> 01:52:16.898
- huh.

01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:18.277
Kind of advice
she used to give.

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:19.650
Okay.

01:52:22.236 --> 01:52:25.456
Now, Emily, where did
you find this lawyer?

01:52:25.948 --> 01:52:28.417
He was
recommended by my friend.

01:52:30.494 --> 01:52:34.840
I'm asking because my husband
knows a real good New York lawyer

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:37.008
and I'm not
entirely comfortable

01:52:37.125 --> 01:52:38.672
with someone no one's
ever heard of.

01:52:38.835 --> 01:52:41.839
My friend's heard of him.
He says he's very good.

01:52:42.089 --> 01:52:43.432
Well, I'm sure he is.

01:52:43.507 --> 01:52:46.727
But I have a responsibility
in this situation

01:52:47.511 --> 01:52:49.184
and I would feel
a whole lot more

01:52:49.304 --> 01:52:50.931
comfortable with
someone who didn't just

01:52:51.014 --> 01:52:52.732
drop in out of
the clear blue sky.

01:52:52.808 --> 01:52:55.061
He didn't drop in out
of the clear blue sky.

01:52:55.185 --> 01:52:57.529
He was recommended
by my friend.

01:52:58.647 --> 01:53:03.323
But, Abigail, even if we switched
lawyers, we'd still have to pay him.

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:06.617
It all comes out of the settlement,
so it's really up to you.

01:53:06.697 --> 01:53:08.665
No, if you all think
he's good...

01:53:08.865 --> 01:53:10.538
I don't know
whether he is or not.

01:53:10.701 --> 01:53:12.044
My friend thinks
he is.

01:53:12.202 --> 01:53:13.545
All right.

01:53:15.163 --> 01:53:17.791
Now, Lisa, what's your
involvement in all this?

01:53:17.874 --> 01:53:19.547
What's your angle?

01:53:20.502 --> 01:53:22.925
I just wanted to...

01:53:24.798 --> 01:53:26.425
I was just there.

01:53:29.886 --> 01:53:32.480
And that's you
and Monica, obviously.

01:53:32.931 --> 01:53:34.228
Mmm-hmm.

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.398
Oh, my God, is that you?

01:53:38.854 --> 01:53:40.197
That's me.

01:53:43.775 --> 01:53:45.573
Oh, my God.
Is that her daughter?

01:53:46.987 --> 01:53:48.284
Mmm-hmm.

01:53:48.822 --> 01:53:49.994
God...

01:53:50.198 --> 01:53:52.326
So, how old was
she when she died?

01:53:53.785 --> 01:53:54.786
Twelve.

01:53:55.662 --> 01:53:57.289
God, I can't
even imagine.

01:53:58.290 --> 01:53:59.416
Neither could we.

01:54:03.587 --> 01:54:08.138
Do you know Monica asked about
her when she was dying?

01:54:10.552 --> 01:54:11.929
No, I didn't.

01:54:12.095 --> 01:54:14.348
Yeah, I think she
was confused, like,

01:54:14.723 --> 01:54:17.067
I think she thought I was
her daughter for a minute.

01:54:17.309 --> 01:54:19.107
Then she was
asking me to call her,

01:54:19.227 --> 01:54:21.025
like, to tell her
what happened, you know?

01:54:21.438 --> 01:54:23.361
Like she didn't
remember she was dead.

01:54:25.817 --> 01:54:29.993
But, then it got confusing, because
I said, "Sure, what's her name'?"

01:54:30.405 --> 01:54:31.907
And she said
her name was Lisa.

01:54:32.032 --> 01:54:33.579
And I said,
"No, that's my name."

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:37.583
I didn't realize we
had the same name.

01:54:41.625 --> 01:54:43.502
And when I found out
her daughter was dead,

01:54:44.002 --> 01:54:45.299
ever since then

01:54:45.796 --> 01:54:48.424
I've had this really
strange feeling that,

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:51.176
some way, for those
last five minutes,

01:54:52.052 --> 01:54:54.054
I kind of was her daughter.

01:54:54.638 --> 01:54:57.983
You know, like in some weird way,
this obviously amazing woman

01:54:58.350 --> 01:55:00.102
got to be with
her daughter again

01:55:00.227 --> 01:55:01.979
for a few minutes,
right before she died.

01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:06.575
And is she still
inhabiting your body?

01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:09.824
Or did she go right back to the
spirit world after it was over?

01:55:09.945 --> 01:55:12.289
I didn't mean she was
literally inhabiting my body.

01:55:12.364 --> 01:55:13.661
I don't believe in
all that stuff at all.

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:16.118
I don't give a fuck
what you believe in.

01:55:16.201 --> 01:55:18.420
Oh, my God! Why are
you so mad at me?

01:55:18.495 --> 01:55:20.338
Because this is
not an opera!

01:55:20.455 --> 01:55:23.004
What? I said this
is not an opera!

01:55:23.083 --> 01:55:24.881
You think I think
this is an opera?

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:27.133
Yes! Because I think
it's dramatic?

01:55:27.337 --> 01:55:28.589
I think you're
very young.

01:55:28.672 --> 01:55:30.015
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:55:30.090 --> 01:55:32.969
If anything, I think it means I
care more than someone who's older,

01:55:33.051 --> 01:55:35.019
because this kind of thing has
never happened to me before!

01:55:35.429 --> 01:55:39.809
No, it means you care more easily.
There's a big difference.

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:42.102
Only it's not you
that it's happening to.

01:55:42.185 --> 01:55:45.314
Yes, it is! I know I'm not the
one who was run over by a bus...

01:55:45.397 --> 01:55:46.614
That's right,
you weren't.

01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:48.613
And you're not the one
who died of leukemia

01:55:48.692 --> 01:55:51.662
and you're not the one who just
died in an earthquake in Algeria!

01:55:51.736 --> 01:55:54.410
But you will be. Do you understand me?
You will be.

01:55:54.531 --> 01:55:55.532
And it's not dramatic.

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:56.616
I'm well aware of that!

01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:00.625
This first-blush, phony deepness
of yours is worth nothing.

01:56:00.704 --> 01:56:01.751
Oh, wow.
Do you understand?

01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:03.298
It's not worth anything!

01:56:03.498 --> 01:56:05.375
Because it'll all be troweled
over in a month or two.

01:56:05.459 --> 01:56:06.460
And when you get older

01:56:06.543 --> 01:56:09.922
and you don't have a big reaction
every time a dog is run over,

01:56:10.005 --> 01:56:11.882
then we'll find out what
kind of a person you are!

01:56:12.257 --> 01:56:13.804
I'm sorry, but
I didn't start this

01:56:13.925 --> 01:56:15.472
conversation and I
don't play these games.

01:56:15.552 --> 01:56:16.895
I'm not playing games!

01:56:17.053 --> 01:56:18.396
And don't look
so outraged!

01:56:18.472 --> 01:56:21.100
You have every right to
falsify your own life,

01:56:21.183 --> 01:56:24.357
but you have no right
to falsify anybody else's.

01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:26.734
It's what makes
people into Nazis!

01:56:27.272 --> 01:56:29.616
And I'm sorry, but it's
just a little suspicious

01:56:29.691 --> 01:56:30.988
that you're making
such a big fuss

01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:32.452
about this when you
didn't even know her

01:56:32.527 --> 01:56:34.074
and you're having troubles
with your own mother.

01:56:34.154 --> 01:56:35.155
Oh, my God!

01:56:35.405 --> 01:56:38.329
But this is my life
we're talking about,

01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:41.420
'cause it's my real
friend who got killed,

01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:44.547
who I'm never
going to see again,

01:56:44.706 --> 01:56:48.176
who I've known since
I was 19 years old myself.

01:56:48.710 --> 01:56:52.055
And I don't want that sucked into
some adolescent self-dramatization!

01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:56.431
I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
I was there and you weren't,

01:56:56.593 --> 01:56:57.765
and if I happen
to express myself

01:56:57.928 --> 01:56:59.100
a little hyperbolic ally,
Emily,

01:56:59.179 --> 01:57:00.681
that's just
the way I talk!

01:57:00.764 --> 01:57:02.562
I can't help it if my
mother's an actress!

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:04.434
Why are you being
so fucking strident?

01:57:05.936 --> 01:57:07.233
"Strident"?
Yeah.

01:57:07.312 --> 01:57:08.438
Okay.

01:57:09.397 --> 01:57:10.398
You should leave.

01:57:10.565 --> 01:57:11.817
Why? Because I
called you strident?

01:57:12.108 --> 01:57:13.951
Yeah. You should leave.

01:57:14.194 --> 01:57:15.286
Okay, I will.

01:57:15.487 --> 01:57:17.080
Now! Okay, let me get my bag!

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.907
All I meant by
saying you were strident

01:57:19.032 --> 01:57:20.705
is that you were
being emphatic!

01:57:20.784 --> 01:57:22.206
I obviously
misused the word.

01:57:22.285 --> 01:57:23.582
Look it up when
you get home.

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.000
Jesus Christ.
You're amazing.

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.377
Yes. I'm amazing.

01:57:26.498 --> 01:57:27.841
Why are you doing this?

01:57:27.916 --> 01:57:31.261
Lisa, I'm not doing anything.
I'm a human being.

01:57:31.545 --> 01:57:33.388
Monica was a human being.

01:57:33.588 --> 01:57:35.340
So was her daughter
and so is your mother.

01:57:35.423 --> 01:57:37.221
We are not
supporting characters

01:57:37.342 --> 01:57:39.185
in the fascinating
story of your life.

01:57:39.261 --> 01:57:41.104
I never said or
thought you were,

01:57:41.179 --> 01:57:42.931
and I really didn't
mean to call you strident.

01:57:43.056 --> 01:57:44.808
I totally
misused the word.

01:57:44.891 --> 01:57:47.644
I wasn't trying to insult you, Emily.
I really wasn't.

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:50.522
I feel so bad
about what happened

01:57:50.605 --> 01:57:53.449
and I'm trying so hard
to do something about it.

01:57:53.525 --> 01:57:55.778
I don't understand why,
if I say something wrong,

01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:58.113
you can't just
give me a break.

01:57:59.948 --> 01:58:01.495
Thanks for letting
me come over.

01:58:02.158 --> 01:58:04.001
I know you don't
want me here.

01:58:04.202 --> 01:58:05.203
It's all right.

01:58:05.287 --> 01:58:07.289
But I didn't have
anyone else to talk to.

01:58:08.164 --> 01:58:11.088
You have always been very
sympathetic to my craziness,

01:58:11.376 --> 01:58:13.049
and I may not
show it all the time,

01:58:13.169 --> 01:58:14.887
but I actually
really appreciate it.

01:58:15.005 --> 01:58:16.131
It's no problem.

01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:20.267
So...

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:22.349
What's been going on?

01:58:23.722 --> 01:58:24.974
I just need to
talk to somebody

01:58:25.056 --> 01:58:28.356
who doesn't completely
misunderstand who I am.

01:58:28.685 --> 01:58:30.358
Or not even who I am,

01:58:30.437 --> 01:58:33.407
but what's going on inside
me, or all around me.

01:58:34.399 --> 01:58:35.696
Sound confused enough?

01:58:35.817 --> 01:58:37.069
No, no.

01:58:37.861 --> 01:58:41.411
Anyway, for
whatever reason,

01:58:41.531 --> 01:58:45.252
I always felt like we understood
each other on some level.

01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:48.914
Even though I'm like this
mass of conflicting impulses,

01:58:49.205 --> 01:58:52.550
and you're basically the most
grownup, rational man I know.

01:58:53.376 --> 01:58:56.721
I doubt that's actually
true, but thank you.

01:59:00.008 --> 01:59:01.885
It's just a little hot.

01:59:02.719 --> 01:59:04.062
A little warm.

01:59:12.729 --> 01:59:13.730
Is this all right?

01:59:13.897 --> 01:59:14.898
Yeah, it's fine.

01:59:17.942 --> 01:59:19.865
Do you allow smoking
in your apartment?

01:59:23.823 --> 01:59:24.995
You can smoke.

01:59:45.053 --> 01:59:46.054
I like your apartment.

01:59:46.137 --> 01:59:47.138
Thanks.

01:59:47.305 --> 01:59:49.228
It's a sublet, actually.

01:59:52.394 --> 01:59:53.737
Sorry.
That's okay.

02:00:09.452 --> 02:00:10.624
This is terrible.

02:00:12.288 --> 02:00:13.505
What is?

02:00:19.963 --> 02:00:21.215
What's terrible?

02:00:23.591 --> 02:00:25.514
I just like you so much.

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.262
Sorry. What a moron.

02:00:27.387 --> 02:00:28.809
Hey, Lisa. Lisa.

02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:32.267
I'm your friend.

02:00:33.268 --> 02:00:35.316
And that's not
gonna change.

02:00:36.813 --> 02:00:38.281
It's not gonna change.

02:00:39.774 --> 02:00:40.900
Thanks.

02:00:44.154 --> 02:00:46.077
I like you so, so much.

02:01:25.695 --> 02:01:27.743
What's it like
in Indiana?

02:01:30.867 --> 02:01:31.914
It's okay.

02:01:52.055 --> 02:01:54.399
Please don't
do that. Don't do that.

02:01:57.393 --> 02:02:00.146
I really wasn't expecting
anything like this to happen.

02:02:02.106 --> 02:02:04.575
I'm really not sure
how I'm supposed to react.

02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:06.611
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna tell anybody,

02:02:06.736 --> 02:02:08.283
if that's what
you're worried about.

02:02:08.363 --> 02:02:10.582
I totally initiated
the whole thing.

02:02:11.366 --> 02:02:13.664
Anyway, it's just sex. You're
acting like a little kid.

02:02:13.743 --> 02:02:15.666
I'll see you
in school.

02:02:28.883 --> 02:02:30.305
You're a fuckin' idiot!

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:33.980
I think teenagers should
definitely rule the world because

02:02:34.055 --> 02:02:36.353
teenagers aren't
corrupted by adult life yet

02:02:36.474 --> 02:02:38.772
and they're idealistic
and they care.

02:02:39.102 --> 02:02:41.070
And I know
a lot of people feel

02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:43.110
that teenagers
are really naive,

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:45.032
which they are,
many of them.

02:02:45.441 --> 02:02:46.863
But they still
haven't had a chance

02:02:46.985 --> 02:02:48.407
to get burned out by
the disappointments

02:02:48.486 --> 02:02:50.830
and harsh realities of
learning how to play the game.

02:02:50.905 --> 02:02:52.999
So, yes, I would
vote "yes."

02:02:53.324 --> 02:02:55.622
All right.
Lisa?

02:02:55.952 --> 02:02:56.999
I'm not even gonna
comment on the fact

02:02:57.078 --> 02:02:59.251
that you just compared
a 19-year-old Palestinian

02:02:59.330 --> 02:03:00.502
to a member of
the Hitler Youth!

02:03:00.582 --> 02:03:02.676
That's right, because they
both like to kill Jews.

02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:04.047
Lisa! Hey!
Come on, guys.

02:03:04.127 --> 02:03:05.845
It's not because they've been
occupied and humiliated

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.763
and bombed out of their homes
for the last 50 years?

02:03:07.839 --> 02:03:08.931
That's partly
why they like it.

02:03:09.007 --> 02:03:10.759
It's not like killing civilians
is their last resort.

02:03:10.842 --> 02:03:13.391
It's their first resort because
it's easy and they like it.

02:03:13.469 --> 02:03:14.891
Raise your hands.
They like it?

02:03:14.971 --> 02:03:16.268
They're just bad
people and they like it?

02:03:16.347 --> 02:03:17.439
Yes! There are bad
people in the world.

02:03:17.515 --> 02:03:19.392
I think they liked blowing up
the World Trade Center!

02:03:19.475 --> 02:03:21.068
They kill their own sisters
when they get raped!

02:03:21.144 --> 02:03:22.145
Who?
It's called barbarism!

02:03:22.228 --> 02:03:24.151
It's practically all people
do is kill each other.

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.732
If they didn't like it,
they wouldn't do it.

02:03:25.815 --> 02:03:27.408
You guys aren't
the only ones in the class!

02:03:27.483 --> 02:03:28.484
You're not even Jewish, Lisa!

02:03:28.568 --> 02:03:30.946
The next person who opens their
mouth without raising their hand...

02:03:31.029 --> 02:03:32.451
I'm fucking half Jewish,
and who cares

02:03:32.572 --> 02:03:33.994
what I am? I'm anti-murder,
not pro-Israel.

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:35.871
Lisa! You can leave!

02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:38.328
Fine. Thank you.

02:03:50.632 --> 02:03:52.009
I guess I lost
my cool a little,

02:03:52.133 --> 02:03:53.510
but there is
such a thing as...

02:03:53.593 --> 02:03:55.061
Who is running
these discussions?

02:03:55.136 --> 02:03:56.934
But, Lisa, you have
to remember,

02:03:57.013 --> 02:03:59.266
it's always easy
for the dominant side

02:03:59.390 --> 02:04:01.688
to be content
with the status quot.

02:04:03.853 --> 02:04:05.070
How do you mean, Ramon?

02:04:05.355 --> 02:04:09.451
I mean the oppressor uses
violence to maintain his position

02:04:09.525 --> 02:04:11.493
and calls it
the rule of law.

02:04:12.195 --> 02:04:16.371
But when the person underfoot uses
violence to change his status,

02:04:16.449 --> 02:04:18.543
he's called a criminal
and a terrorist.

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:22.998
And the violence of the state
is called upon to put him down.

02:04:23.247 --> 02:04:24.248
I see.

02:04:24.582 --> 02:04:26.801
And what would
you like them to do?

02:04:28.628 --> 02:04:29.629
"They" meaning?

02:04:30.463 --> 02:04:32.932
The Jew oppressors. What
would you like them to do?

02:04:33.508 --> 02:04:35.181
I didn't use
that expression.

02:04:35.426 --> 02:04:37.269
- No, you didn't.
- But since you ask...

02:04:37.345 --> 02:04:39.268
I spent the whole day
arguing about this.

02:04:39.389 --> 02:04:41.312
I didn't really mean
to bring it up again.

02:04:41.391 --> 02:04:42.563
Don't handle me.

02:04:42.725 --> 02:04:43.897
I'm not handling you.

02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:46.028
What did you think of the play?
Don't bother, Mom.

02:04:46.104 --> 02:04:49.734
And I think it's ironic in the
extreme that the victims of Nazis

02:04:49.816 --> 02:04:51.784
find it essential...
If Israelis were like Nazis

02:04:51.859 --> 02:04:53.657
there wouldn't be any Arabs left.
...to use Nazi tactics...

02:04:53.736 --> 02:04:55.158
- That's what I've been saying!
- And I'm leaving.

02:04:55.238 --> 02:04:57.240
That seems excessive,
Emily, come on.

02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:00.368
That's the response.
That's the Jewish response.

02:05:01.828 --> 02:05:02.829
It's the what?

02:05:02.954 --> 02:05:03.955
It's the Jewish response.

02:05:04.038 --> 02:05:06.757
You don't like what I am
saying or what I do, so you...

02:05:06.833 --> 02:05:07.834
Oh, my God!

02:05:07.959 --> 02:05:09.006
That's my Jewish
response.

02:05:09.085 --> 02:05:11.759
That's all right.
It's all right.

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:14.591
It's all right.
That's all right.

02:05:16.217 --> 02:05:18.515
It's a perfect
little encapsule.

02:05:20.179 --> 02:05:21.977
It's the Jewish response.

02:05:28.896 --> 02:05:31.274
Joan, I won't
defend myself.

02:05:31.399 --> 02:05:32.867
All what I meant was

02:05:32.942 --> 02:05:35.786
that was the typical response
you will get from someone

02:05:35.903 --> 02:05:38.577
who will take that position
that woman was taking.

02:05:40.074 --> 02:05:43.920
If I would have said the word
"Israeli" instead of the word "Jewish

02:05:44.162 --> 02:05:45.880
I don't think there
would be a problem.

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:48.795
But if you want
to break up with me

02:05:48.958 --> 02:05:51.427
because I used
the wrong adjective...

02:05:51.961 --> 02:05:53.258
What I'm going to do?

02:05:53.337 --> 02:05:54.930
I'm not going to beg you.

02:06:11.689 --> 02:06:13.032
Hello?

02:06:13.107 --> 02:06:14.780
Hi, Dad, how are you?

02:06:18.488 --> 02:06:21.162
Really?
What's the matter?

02:06:26.996 --> 02:06:28.293
I never said I
didn't want to go.

02:06:28.581 --> 02:06:30.049
I can't get
a straight answer from

02:06:30.166 --> 02:06:31.668
anybody about what
they want to eat...

02:06:32.168 --> 02:06:33.841
Annette says she's
called you four times

02:06:34.003 --> 02:06:35.676
and you haven't
called her back.

02:06:35.797 --> 02:06:37.344
The ranch seems
to be putting some

02:06:37.507 --> 02:06:39.100
kind of intolerable
pressure on her

02:06:39.175 --> 02:06:42.019
to choose five lunches
for a five-day trip that

02:06:42.095 --> 02:06:43.722
we're not taking for
a month and a half.

02:06:43.805 --> 02:06:45.557
I talk to Curtis
about it and all I get

02:06:45.681 --> 02:06:47.479
is monosyllables.
So what is the point?

02:06:47.725 --> 02:06:50.069
I think he's really
looking forward to it.

02:06:50.144 --> 02:06:51.896
Well, that hasn't
been my impression.

02:06:52.105 --> 02:06:54.278
I also think, Lisa,
it would be a good idea

02:06:54.357 --> 02:06:57.327
if we just tabled the notion of
you coming out here next year.

02:06:57.902 --> 02:06:59.404
Things look like
they're gonna start

02:06:59.529 --> 02:07:01.031
picking up for me
a little bit in the fall

02:07:01.114 --> 02:07:02.115
and that means
I'm not gonna be

02:07:02.198 --> 02:07:03.165
around the house
all that much,

02:07:03.241 --> 02:07:04.618
and since you and Annette
detest each other,

02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:06.043
I honestly don't
think that's what

02:07:06.202 --> 02:07:07.545
I want to come home
to after a 14-hour day.

02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:08.667
We don't detest each other.

02:07:08.746 --> 02:07:10.794
Well, I gotta tell you,
it doesn't strike me

02:07:10.873 --> 02:07:12.875
as something you
seem that serious about.

02:07:13.251 --> 02:07:14.252
Okay.

02:07:14.335 --> 02:07:18.681
So, just tell Curtis that New Mexico's
off and I'll talk to you whenever.

02:07:18.756 --> 02:07:19.882
Okay.
All right.

02:07:20.716 --> 02:07:21.717
What's wrong?

02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:29.688
Mr. Deutsch?
I'm right here.

02:07:29.767 --> 02:07:33.522
I had the thought, if they're
willing to settle so quickly,

02:07:33.604 --> 02:07:35.606
maybe we're better off
waiting a little bit,

02:07:35.731 --> 02:07:37.779
you know, ratlin'
the saber a little more?

02:07:37.859 --> 02:07:38.826
Maybe we're cutting'
our own throats here.

02:07:38.901 --> 02:07:40.027
They are responding to
the story in the paper.

02:07:40.111 --> 02:07:41.533
That's
just common sense.

02:07:41.988 --> 02:07:45.242
But what you gotta understand is
they're offering to settle now

02:07:45.324 --> 02:07:47.622
because they want to get the
story out of the paper.

02:07:47.743 --> 02:07:48.835
That's why Russel thinks...

02:07:48.911 --> 02:07:50.538
Besides, the point is not
to jack up the price.

02:07:50.621 --> 02:07:51.622
I'm sorry?

02:07:51.831 --> 02:07:52.957
We didn't hear
that last bit.

02:07:53.082 --> 02:07:54.254
Ladies, let me just...

02:07:54.584 --> 02:07:58.009
Rob. Abigail. Let me
just finish my thought.

02:07:58.671 --> 02:08:01.220
They are jumping at
the bait right now.

02:08:01.465 --> 02:08:03.388
But if another six
months goes by, we run

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:05.432
a serious risk of
losing our momentum.

02:08:05.595 --> 02:08:06.596
You see what I mean?

02:08:06.721 --> 02:08:10.726
Now I'm gonna hit them very,
very hard, I guarantee it.

02:08:10.975 --> 02:08:13.353
That's why I wanted all of us
together on the phone,

02:08:13.436 --> 02:08:15.939
so we could talk about your other
terms, besides the damages.

02:08:16.272 --> 02:08:18.741
I promise you, lam gonna
be very, very aggressive.

02:08:18.816 --> 02:08:20.284
What other
terms would there be?

02:08:20.359 --> 02:08:22.737
What do you mean,
like some kind of a fund?

02:08:23.487 --> 02:08:25.034
A what?

02:08:25.156 --> 02:08:26.749
Some kind of
fund for the kids?

02:08:27.408 --> 02:08:28.625
I don't understand what
you mean by a fund.

02:08:28.743 --> 02:08:29.790
What does he mean,
"Besides the damages?"

02:08:29.869 --> 02:08:31.542
Mr. Deutsch, do you
mean some kind of trust fund?

02:08:31.621 --> 02:08:34.124
A fund that would be set up by
the bus company for our kids?

02:08:34.207 --> 02:08:35.424
For tax purposes?

02:08:35.541 --> 02:08:36.884
What fucking fund?

02:08:37.001 --> 02:08:38.344
These people
are retarded.

02:08:38.419 --> 02:08:39.386
Because I have
to tell you,

02:08:39.462 --> 02:08:42.056
we have just lived through that
nightmare with Monica and our children,

02:08:42.131 --> 02:08:44.259
and it was not
a pleasant experience.

02:08:44.342 --> 02:08:48.222
We just want a clean, straight...
Damages is fine.

02:08:48.971 --> 02:08:50.848
Lisa, I'm really proud of you!
Thank you.

02:08:50.932 --> 02:08:52.479
Really, really proud!
Thank you.

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:54.352
So, what happens now?

02:08:54.435 --> 02:08:56.312
They have to
figure out the terms.

02:08:57.647 --> 02:08:59.991
Hello? Yes?

02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:02.743
What do you mean!
What's the matter?

02:09:03.527 --> 02:09:04.619
Yes?

02:09:05.905 --> 02:09:06.906
Yes.

02:09:07.114 --> 02:09:08.161
What? Ramon's had a heart attack.

02:09:08.324 --> 02:09:09.826
What? Is he gonna be okay?
Quiet!

02:09:11.661 --> 02:09:12.708
Yes?

02:09:13.829 --> 02:09:14.830
Okay.

02:09:16.499 --> 02:09:18.001
Okay, let me write
that down.

02:09:32.515 --> 02:09:34.188
Okay, I'm really
not trying to be funny,

02:09:34.267 --> 02:09:36.861
but isn't this
a Jewish funeral home?

02:09:38.271 --> 02:09:40.023
I guess they do both.

02:09:57.957 --> 02:09:59.083
Excuse me.

02:09:59.542 --> 02:10:00.634
Joan?
Yes.

02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:04.964
Oh, you must be Rodrigo.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

02:10:07.383 --> 02:10:08.976
Rodrigo, this...

02:10:09.093 --> 02:10:10.720
I want to tell
you, Joan,

02:10:11.012 --> 02:10:13.140
my Dad talked about
you all the time.

02:10:13.681 --> 02:10:14.648
He did?

02:10:14.724 --> 02:10:15.725
Yes.

02:10:16.726 --> 02:10:18.444
Thank you for
telling me that.

02:10:20.021 --> 02:10:21.568
And, I don't know if
this is appropriate...

02:10:21.731 --> 02:10:23.278
No, it's okay.

02:10:23.733 --> 02:10:24.734
But...

02:10:25.568 --> 02:10:27.241
He went out a lot.

02:10:31.532 --> 02:10:34.411
Do you know, the last
time I spoke to him,

02:10:35.453 --> 02:10:38.377
he told me, from the
moment he met you,

02:10:39.707 --> 02:10:41.084
he knew he wanted
to marry you.

02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:46.089
Because, for the first time
since he lost my mother,

02:10:46.881 --> 02:10:49.805
he finally met a woman
he could really connect with.

02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:56.478
Well,

02:10:57.475 --> 02:10:58.476
he was...

02:10:58.601 --> 02:10:59.648
Excuse me.

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:18.538
Thanks for coming with me today.
I really appreciate it.

02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:20.123
Oh, you're welcome.

02:11:21.791 --> 02:11:23.464
I don't want to
be macabre, but...

02:11:23.793 --> 02:11:25.511
Ramon and I were
supposed to go to hear

02:11:25.628 --> 02:11:27.380
The Tales of Hoffman
the week after next

02:11:27.463 --> 02:11:28.931
and I still have the tickets.

02:11:29.965 --> 02:11:32.764
Would you be interested in going?
Or should I give them away?

02:11:33.386 --> 02:11:36.185
It's Monday night.
We can dress up.

02:11:37.056 --> 02:11:38.148
I'll go.

02:11:42.603 --> 02:11:43.820
What did you make of that?

02:11:46.273 --> 02:11:47.900
People don't relate
to each other, Mom.

02:11:49.110 --> 02:11:52.455
They're totally disconnected.
That's what I make of it.

02:11:54.281 --> 02:11:55.282
Well...

02:11:56.951 --> 02:11:58.874
I think that's kind of
unfortunate that you think that,

02:11:58.953 --> 02:12:00.205
because I feel
like you and I used to

02:12:00.287 --> 02:12:02.005
relate to each
other really well.

02:12:02.832 --> 02:12:04.630
I'm not trying to
hurt your feelings.

02:12:05.167 --> 02:12:06.760
It's just
a general observation.

02:12:13.467 --> 02:12:14.468
Okay.

02:12:16.887 --> 02:12:19.561
Hey, can I get a hug?

02:12:20.516 --> 02:12:21.517
Sure.

02:12:25.271 --> 02:12:27.365
I just
feel totally at sea.

02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:20.872
Hi, Emily. Hi, Lisa.

02:13:20.951 --> 02:13:22.544
- Hello.
- Hi.

02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:23.792
Hello.

02:13:24.538 --> 02:13:27.633
I am very pleased to be
able to inform you all

02:13:27.917 --> 02:13:31.137
that I had a long meeting with
the lawyer from the bus company

02:13:31.253 --> 02:13:34.757
and they have agreed
to settle for $350,000.

02:13:35.090 --> 02:13:37.092
- What? Fantastic!
- That is just great!

02:13:37.218 --> 02:13:39.186
I assume this is
agreeable with everybody.

02:13:39.261 --> 02:13:40.433
- Yes!
- It's just fantastic!

02:13:40.513 --> 02:13:44.518
But, of course, I gotta bring the
offer to you, and get your approval.

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:45.817
Mr. Deutsch?
Now,

02:13:45.893 --> 02:13:48.772
I know there was a concern
after our last call

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:50.231
that we were jumping
the gun a little bit.

02:13:50.314 --> 02:13:51.315
- That's okay.
- We're only...

02:13:51.398 --> 02:13:52.775
Abigail. Rob.

02:13:53.025 --> 02:13:55.198
Could we just listen to what
Russel has to say

02:13:55.277 --> 02:13:58.531
and then talk about it once
he's told us the whole story

02:13:58.614 --> 02:14:00.161
and given us his
recommendation?

02:14:00.366 --> 02:14:02.789
Yeah. Yes. Sorry.
Fire away.

02:14:03.869 --> 02:14:04.995
I was gonna say,

02:14:05.079 --> 02:14:07.173
I know there was a concern
after our last call

02:14:07.248 --> 02:14:09.376
that we were jumping
the gun a little bit.

02:14:09.458 --> 02:14:10.505
Well, that's okay.

02:14:10.501 --> 02:14:12.469
Would you let him talk, please!
It's okay.

02:14:12.545 --> 02:14:13.797
- We're sorry.
- Sorry.

02:14:14.255 --> 02:14:18.055
I want to tell you that I
think it's a very good offer.

02:14:18.425 --> 02:14:19.893
I think they're
very anxious to settle.

02:14:20.302 --> 02:14:22.646
But I also do think
that at this moment,

02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:24.473
they are under
the maximum amount of

02:14:24.598 --> 02:14:26.350
pressure that we can
really bring to bear,

02:14:26.475 --> 02:14:28.318
and I don't believe they're
gonna come up any higher.

02:14:28.936 --> 02:14:31.815
Hey, $350,000,
that's nothing to sneeze at.

02:14:31.897 --> 02:14:33.695
Let me just... I just want
to introduce the thought...

02:14:33.774 --> 02:14:35.651
- Can you all hear me?
- Yes!

02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:37.702
Was that everybody? Okay.

02:14:37.778 --> 02:14:39.325
Emily? What do you think?

02:14:39.488 --> 02:14:41.456
I think it sounds
like we should do it.

02:14:41.574 --> 02:14:43.201
But I'd like to be...
Okay. If that's the vote.

02:14:43.284 --> 02:14:44.877
Unless you
think there's something

02:14:44.994 --> 02:14:46.621
to be gained from
holding out for more.

02:14:46.704 --> 02:14:47.956
I think that would
be a big mistake.

02:14:48.497 --> 02:14:49.749
Robbie, what
do you think?

02:14:53.252 --> 02:14:54.344
- Sold!
- Sold!

02:14:54.461 --> 02:14:55.462
Okay.

02:14:56.130 --> 02:14:59.054
Now, the only downside
to this as it stands,

02:15:00.259 --> 02:15:02.762
and I know this may be a serious
wrinkle for all of you,

02:15:03.345 --> 02:15:05.643
is that the bus
company will absolutely

02:15:05.764 --> 02:15:08.108
not discuss the removal
of the driver.

02:15:08.309 --> 02:15:09.561
What?
What do you mean?

02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:11.403
The driver? Then
tell them to forget it.

02:15:11.478 --> 02:15:13.446
What do you mean? They won't
discuss the removal of the driver?

02:15:13.522 --> 02:15:14.990
Ladies. Let me finish
what I was saying.

02:15:15.107 --> 02:15:16.529
It's just
a blast in our ears.

02:15:16.609 --> 02:15:17.701
Let him finish.

02:15:17.818 --> 02:15:18.910
Finish what?
Forget it!

02:15:19.278 --> 02:15:21.576
Thank you. Lisa,
I want you to understand,

02:15:21.697 --> 02:15:24.041
I pressed them very,
very hard on this,

02:15:24.366 --> 02:15:27.290
but they will not discuss
disciplining a company employee

02:15:27.369 --> 02:15:28.495
as part of the settlement

02:15:28.579 --> 02:15:30.673
because it could be
seen as an admission

02:15:30.748 --> 02:15:31.965
of guilt on
the part of the MTA.

02:15:32.041 --> 02:15:33.884
What does giving
us $300,000 mean?

02:15:34.043 --> 02:15:36.296
Settling out of court does not
imply an admission of guilt.

02:15:36.378 --> 02:15:38.221
It simply does not
carry the same stigma.

02:15:38.464 --> 02:15:40.808
On top of that,
you may not know, Lisa,

02:15:40.883 --> 02:15:42.135
that they're
currently involved

02:15:42.259 --> 02:15:43.852
in a very tricky
labor dispute right now.

02:15:43.927 --> 02:15:46.476
Yeah, we know about that!
Just tell them to forget it.

02:15:46.764 --> 02:15:47.765
I know that's
your reaction...

02:15:47.890 --> 02:15:48.937
It's the only
reason we're here.

02:15:49.058 --> 02:15:50.480
Can lump in here?
Russel?

02:15:50.601 --> 02:15:52.069
It's really not
your decision.

02:15:52.186 --> 02:15:53.403
It's Emily's decision.
Hello?

02:15:53.479 --> 02:15:54.480
Are you still with us? Hello?
No.

02:15:54.563 --> 02:15:55.860
They're not listening, Robbie.
It's not?

02:15:55.939 --> 02:15:56.940
No!

02:15:57.066 --> 02:15:58.113
It's Abigail's decision,

02:15:58.609 --> 02:16:00.202
because she's
the next of kin.

02:16:00.319 --> 02:16:01.912
But she didn't
even know about it!

02:16:01.987 --> 02:16:02.988
That doesn't matter.

02:16:03.072 --> 02:16:05.040
Could we get back
in this conversation, please?

02:16:05.115 --> 02:16:06.207
Yes. I'm sorry.

02:16:06.784 --> 02:16:09.537
Obviously there's some strong
emotions going either way here.

02:16:09.787 --> 02:16:11.835
Listen, Emily? I don't
know what you're thinking,

02:16:11.914 --> 02:16:13.541
but Rob and I are
thinking we should take

02:16:13.666 --> 02:16:15.293
Russel's recommendation
while we can.

02:16:15.376 --> 02:16:17.970
Because if they won't fire the
guy, they're not gonna fire him.

02:16:18.045 --> 02:16:19.012
And six months or
a year from now...

02:16:19.088 --> 02:16:20.089
Exactly.

02:16:20.172 --> 02:16:21.344
We're gonna be
in a situation

02:16:21.423 --> 02:16:22.845
where we're begging them
for half this much...

02:16:22.925 --> 02:16:24.677
The entire point
of the lawsuit

02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:27.309
was to get the guy fired so he
doesn't kill somebody else.

02:16:27.388 --> 02:16:29.857
It was not to get
you $350,000

02:16:29.932 --> 02:16:31.354
you didn't know
you were entitled to

02:16:31.475 --> 02:16:32.942
for somebody you
didn't even like!

02:16:33.018 --> 02:16:34.816
And the only reason you're
getting the money at all

02:16:34.895 --> 02:16:37.443
is because I started this whole
fucking thing in motion!

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:38.775
I'm sorry for swearing,

02:16:38.941 --> 02:16:40.817
but you should be willing
to trade in all the money

02:16:40.942 --> 02:16:42.035
for getting this
guy off the street!

02:16:42.152 --> 02:16:43.244
For getting him,
Abigail!

02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:45.414
Well, I'm sorry,
but I have a responsibility

02:16:45.489 --> 02:16:48.914
to Monica and I take that
responsibility very seriously.

02:16:48.992 --> 02:16:50.959
And rather than being cursed
at over the telephone

02:16:51.036 --> 02:16:53.915
for having the courtesy to involve
you in these discussions, Lisa,

02:16:53.996 --> 02:16:55.965
I would hope you would be
guided by our judgment.

02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:57.041
Unless I'm wrong about that.

02:16:57.126 --> 02:16:58.093
None of that matters.

02:16:58.168 --> 02:17:00.967
Unless I'm wrong about that, just
what is your interest in this?

02:17:01.129 --> 02:17:03.132
Because I'm the one
who killed her!

02:17:03.215 --> 02:17:06.764
I'm the one who killed her,
but at least I know I did it.

02:17:06.843 --> 02:17:08.517
And that guy has no idea!

02:17:08.594 --> 02:17:11.394
He is wandering around
blaming everybody else.

02:17:11.473 --> 02:17:15.727
All I want is for somebody to let him
know that what he did was wrong.

02:17:15.811 --> 02:17:19.236
And if they don't fire
him, and all you want is the money,

02:17:19.314 --> 02:17:21.281
and the police
won't do anything,

02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:23.323
then how is he
gonna know he's wrong?

02:17:23.443 --> 02:17:25.492
You can't take
the deal, Abigail!

02:17:25.611 --> 02:17:27.330
It wasn't to
get you any money,

02:17:27.489 --> 02:17:29.241
it was because we
wanted to get him fired!

02:17:29.324 --> 02:17:30.450
Well, it may not
matter to you,

02:17:30.534 --> 02:17:34.584
but where I come from, $350,000
is an awful lot of money

02:17:34.663 --> 02:17:36.665
and to my mind is
a positive result

02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:38.758
of all this tragedy
and not just negative.

02:17:38.834 --> 02:17:40.710
Not just getting
someone fired for one mistake,

02:17:40.794 --> 02:17:41.841
no matter
how bad it was.

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.388
Shove it up your ass!

02:17:43.464 --> 02:17:44.431
Lisa!

02:17:44.505 --> 02:17:47.180
You sleazy fucking lawyer!
And you're a moralistic cunt!

02:18:05.693 --> 02:18:08.322
At this point, I literally
have a zero-tolerance Roger policy.

02:18:08.906 --> 02:18:11.534
Good for you. Glad to
hear I'm not the only one.

02:18:12.409 --> 02:18:13.501
Hey!

02:18:14.119 --> 02:18:16.041
Hey, Lisa.
What's up?

02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:18.749
Hey, did you guys know
I had an abortion last week?

02:18:22.544 --> 02:18:24.137
No. I didn't know that.

02:18:24.213 --> 02:18:26.136
Yeah, it cost $400.

02:18:27.674 --> 02:18:29.392
Um... Should I...

02:18:29.468 --> 02:18:30.514
No, no, don't go anywhere.

02:18:30.636 --> 02:18:32.058
Yeah, don't go anywhere.

02:18:36.642 --> 02:18:38.736
Do you want to
tell us about it?

02:18:39.186 --> 02:18:40.563
Yeah, I do.

02:18:43.065 --> 02:18:44.407
Okay.

02:18:45.691 --> 02:18:46.739
Go ahead.

02:18:48.403 --> 02:18:49.404
Well...

02:18:52.532 --> 02:18:55.082
Do your parents
know about this, Lisa?

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:56.161
Yes.

02:18:56.787 --> 02:18:59.084
And have you told
the father, honey?

02:18:59.331 --> 02:19:01.709
No. There's a couple
of people it could be.

02:19:02.376 --> 02:19:05.094
Well, I think you better
tell them, whoever they are.

02:19:05.796 --> 02:19:06.797
No.

02:19:08.048 --> 02:19:09.721
No. Never mind,
I mean, I'm sure

02:19:09.842 --> 02:19:11.514
he's sorry, anyway,
whichever one he is.

02:19:11.677 --> 02:19:15.272
I don't see how that makes any
difference, at all, if he's sorry.

02:19:16.514 --> 02:19:17.732
That doesn't matter.

02:19:19.559 --> 02:19:22.154
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have brought this up.

02:19:22.771 --> 02:19:23.772
Please don't tell anyone.

02:19:23.856 --> 02:19:25.483
We're not
gonna tell anyone.

02:19:25.566 --> 02:19:28.240
But you're gonna have to tell
whoever it could be.

02:19:28.317 --> 02:19:29.695
It's okay, I...

02:19:30.445 --> 02:19:32.243
I gotta go-

02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:34.537
It doesn't matter
about the father

02:19:34.616 --> 02:19:36.709
because the whole
thing was my fault.

02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.291
I'm sorry.

02:19:43.625 --> 02:19:45.218
What was that?

02:19:49.423 --> 02:19:50.470
Mom's looking for you.

02:19:50.632 --> 02:19:51.724
What for?

02:19:52.092 --> 02:19:53.435
She thinks you're going out
with her tonight.

02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:54.636
Where are we going?

02:19:54.887 --> 02:19:55.979
I don't know.

02:20:02.978 --> 02:20:04.821
Don't get run over.

02:20:06.356 --> 02:20:07.733
Wait.
What?

02:20:10.777 --> 02:20:12.529
I want to see
if that's him.

02:20:24.458 --> 02:20:26.426
It's him, Mom.
That's the one.

02:20:52.736 --> 02:20:53.737
Hey.

02:20:57.324 --> 02:21:00.043
Well, so far it's not the
greatest opera I ever heard.

02:21:00.327 --> 02:21:01.874
What do you mean?
It's okay.
