00:02.001 --> 00:03.002
Previously on Lost:

00:03.087 --> 00:05.630
Locke, do you have a message
to go on the raft?

00:05.714 --> 00:08.841
For when they get rescued.
They can contact your family.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.016
- Michael!
- Jin!

00:32.783 --> 00:34.951
We were on a plane.
Sydney to Los Angeles.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.911
- Flight 815?
- Right.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.624
Back up!

00:43.043 --> 00:44.585
Coming out.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.398
Hi, there, Hurley!

01:52.529 --> 01:55.573
- Jin, you're here.
- I sure am.

01:57.659 --> 02:01.871
- Dude, you speak English.
- No. You're speaking Korean.

02:16.303 --> 02:24.435
Everything's going to change.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.441
Have a "cluckety-cluck-cluck" day, Hugo.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.235
Hurley!

02:37.199 --> 02:41.994
- You fell asleep?
- No. I was just... resting my eyes.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.918
- The numbers are written right there.
- Yeah. I remember the numbers.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.881
Locke went back to the beach,
so I'll be taking the next shift.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.133
Awesome.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.719
Jack told me about your job.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.473
At least we have jobs again, right?

03:03.392 --> 03:04.684
Hooray for us.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.362
Well, ain't life grand?

03:22.119 --> 03:25.580
What I wouldn't give
for a cup of water right now...

03:33.046 --> 03:36.632
No way. No more human pyramids.
Just forget it.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.844
Hey!

03:39.928 --> 03:43.764
Hey! Hey! Let us out of here!

03:43.849 --> 03:46.392
Enough! Just chill!

03:47.978 --> 03:50.271
Every minute I spend down here

03:50.355 --> 03:53.774
is another minute
my boy is still out there.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.777
Well, let me break it down for ya,
Mikey.

03:56.862 --> 04:00.489
Rambina and her buddies are trying
to figure out what to do with us,

04:00.574 --> 04:04.452
so until they make up their damn mind,
there ain't nothing we can do.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.587
Yeah.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.132
Why don't you pee on it?

04:28.518 --> 04:29.936
Grab the rope.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.316
Please.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.699
Don't do it.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.458
Climb the rope, or I shoot your friend.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.019
You next.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.898
Don't do it. She's bluffing.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.987
Gun's only got one bullet,
she ain't gonna waste it on...

05:21.071 --> 05:22.655
Son of a bitch!

05:24.533 --> 05:26.075
- God!
- Grab the rope.

05:41.216 --> 05:45.344
You want me, Hot Lips? You're gonna
have to come down here and get...

05:47.431 --> 05:48.973
Bitch.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.284
Four, eight, 15,

06:08.368 --> 06:12.621
16 and 23,
with the Mega Number 42.

06:12.706 --> 06:18.044
Whoever has those numbers has won
or will share in a near-record jackpot.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.964
That's right, Mary Jo, because
this is the 16th week without a winner.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.843
Hugo?

06:29.473 --> 06:33.267
Hugo! Oh! Hugo, wake up! Wake up!

06:33.351 --> 06:34.769
Stop!

06:34.853 --> 06:37.271
Ma, stop! I just slipped.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.690
Slipped, sitting down? Is it your heart?

06:39.775 --> 06:41.901
- Ma, I'm fine.
- You're lying.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.236
I always know.
You don't look me in the eye.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.239
- I'm not lying.
- Then tell me what happened.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.500
It must have been something I ate.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.754
Yes, something you ate, because
you eat basura, and you don't exercise.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.590
- I do exercise.
- Falling down is not exercise.

07:04.674 --> 07:08.594
The only time you move
is to lift a drumstick from the bucket.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.014
Every day, it's the same thing:
work, TV, chicken.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.143
You have to change your life, Hugo.

07:16.228 --> 07:19.063
You think someone else
will change it for you?

07:19.147 --> 07:22.149
Maybe if you pray every day
Jesus Christ will come down,

07:22.234 --> 07:25.778
take 200 pounds and bring you
a decent woman. And a new car.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.988
Yes, Jesus can bring you a new car.

07:28.073 --> 07:31.534
Maybe I don't wanna change.
Maybe I like my life.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.497
That must be Jesus.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.216
Yes, it is Jesus! He wants
to know what color car you want!

07:57.185 --> 08:01.230
Hurley! All right, mate?
We need to have a little chat.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.567
Mummy's off for a walk,
so it's just you, me, and the baby.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.901
Spill it.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.738
Spill what?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.991
The hatch. What's in it?

08:14.119 --> 08:16.495
Nothing, really.

08:16.580 --> 08:20.249
You've been out there an entire day
and night. Looking at nothing?

08:22.085 --> 08:26.005
Well, I guess
it's kind of like a bunker.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.008
You know, from World War II? Only newer.

08:29.718 --> 08:32.052
And what's in it?

08:32.136 --> 08:33.888
I don't know.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.222
But somehow you know it's a bunker.

08:37.142 --> 08:40.144
Well, I guess someone told me?

08:43.063 --> 08:45.524
You're gonna lie to me?

08:45.609 --> 08:49.778
- You're gonna lie to the baby?
- Dude, look, I'd never lie.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.615
And the time you told me
you were worth $150 million?

08:53.325 --> 08:55.743
- It's 156 million.
- I'm sorry!

08:55.827 --> 08:59.538
I must've confused it
with the 900 trillion I am worth myself!

09:00.123 --> 09:03.375
And this baby's made of
chocolate lollipops, so excuse us,

09:03.460 --> 09:06.295
I'm gonna flap my wings
and fly off this island.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.614
- Hey, Rose.
- Hey, yourself.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.118
So, doing laundry, huh?

09:38.203 --> 09:40.788
Indeed I am.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.999
You wanna hand me
those dirty clothes over there?

09:48.213 --> 09:49.838
Thank you.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.050
Don't you wanna know what happened?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.261
- What happened?
- You know, out there.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.264
Everyone's asking me
what's in the hatch.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.975
Well, that's your business, honey.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.561
- Don't you wanna know?
- Well, whatever it is,

10:04.646 --> 10:07.982
it's not gonna help get
this laundry done, now is it?

10:12.028 --> 10:15.781
Well, actually, it sort of is.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.082
It's around here somewhere.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.204
Someone actually lived down here?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.587
Well, what is it for?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.425
It's kind of a long story.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.722
Hurley. Who else did you tell?

11:21.806 --> 11:24.516
No one. I swear.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.978
Dude, it's a big job. I needed...

11:29.856 --> 11:30.939
...help.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.984
- Hello, Jack.
- Hey, Rose.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.737
She's cool. She won't tell anyone.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.407
Honey,
I don't even know what I would say.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.005
All this is food?

12:38.133 --> 12:42.010
It's only a matter of time before we
have to tell everyone what we found.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.221
So you know what to do?

12:44.305 --> 12:48.225
Inventory all of it
and figure out how we make it last.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.437
In the meantime,
nobody gets anything.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.690
No exceptions.
That's your responsibility, Hurley. OK?

12:56.526 --> 12:58.944
- What's that?
- You don't wanna know.

13:00.989 --> 13:04.950
"Dharma Initiative salad dressing:
ranch composite."

13:05.994 --> 13:08.078
That sounds tasty.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.211
"Apollo Bars?" You ever hear of these?

13:18.256 --> 13:21.592
But candy is candy.
That's what Bernard always says.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.471
Talk about a sweet tooth.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.849
That man has a mouth
full of sweet teeth.

13:28.933 --> 13:33.103
- Bernard. That was your husband?
- Is my husband.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.732
But I thought he was
in the back of the plane?

13:40.153 --> 13:43.614
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- No, that's OK, don't feel bad.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.991
Bernard is fine. I know it.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.785
You wanna get the canned tuna?

13:56.294 --> 13:58.587
Everyone's gonna hate me, Rose.

13:59.422 --> 14:02.174
Now, that's just plain silly.

14:02.258 --> 14:06.011
You're about the only one on this island
that everybody loves.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.389
Well, that'll change.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.725
You happen to find any shampoo in here?

14:11.809 --> 14:14.228
Yeah, there's some right over here.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.025
Kate, you can't take it...

14:20.109 --> 14:21.276
Thanks, Hurley.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.950
- It's just one bottle.
- That's where it starts.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.623
Welcome to Mr. Cluck's,
can I take your order?

14:39.671 --> 14:41.213
Hey, Hugo.

14:44.425 --> 14:48.387
- You OK, man?
- Yeah. Fine.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.766
Reyes! My office! Now!

14:59.065 --> 15:01.066
You wanna tell me something, Reyes?

15:05.989 --> 15:07.573
No.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.700
You sure about that?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.621
Yeah.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.207
This is last night's surveillance tape.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.387
Reyes, you owe the company
for an eight-piece dark-meat combo.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.682
- I didn't eat eight.
- You want to watch the whole tape?

15:33.766 --> 15:37.311
Oh, and while you're here:
how many times do I gotta tell you

15:37.395 --> 15:40.522
those napkins cost money, all right?

15:40.607 --> 15:44.901
It's two per customer. Two. We're not
made of money here at Mr. Cluck's.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.404
I'm not made of money.
Are you made of money?

15:47.488 --> 15:50.616
If you're made of money,
maybe you don't want to work here.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.578
So get it together.
What, is that a problem, Reyes?

16:05.506 --> 16:07.466
Dude, I quit.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.095
Oh, my God.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.683
- Oh, my God.
- Dude? Are you OK?

16:17.060 --> 16:20.646
- I'm fine.
- Randy is losing his brain in there!

16:20.730 --> 16:23.690
You should get back in
or he'll make you scrub johns all week.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.901
Doubt it. I quit too.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.905
- What?
- Looks like we got ourselves a day off.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.784
Who needs money
when you got good looks?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.690
You can come out now.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.608
I saw you back at the rock.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.404
Then at the mangrove tree.

17:11.196 --> 17:15.325
In fact, I've walked in a big circle.
I'm not sure how you didn't realize it.

17:21.958 --> 17:25.167
All right, you don't have to insult me.

17:29.757 --> 17:33.009
You wanna tell me
why you've been following me, Charlie?

17:33.094 --> 17:34.511
Yeah.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.391
Quite simply, John,
there are a lot of secrets around here.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.561
And I'm tired of being
at the kids' table.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.730
I got Claire's baby back!

17:44.814 --> 17:47.816
I didn't go to the Black Rock
on the A-Team mission,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.652
but I would have,
if someone had asked me.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.906
I think I'm entitled
to some sodding answers around here.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.578
What do you want to know?

18:08.004 --> 18:10.380
How's it going?

18:10.465 --> 18:14.551
It's not. On the other side
of this door, there's more concrete.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.263
I'd say it's at least
eight-to-ten-feet thick.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.432
Did you see this?

18:24.103 --> 18:27.898
Interesting.
Good thing this is titanium.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.609
Almost no magnetic attraction.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.195
Well, we're not going to get in up here.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.030
Up here?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.954
Perhaps we can go under it.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.056
Grab the rope.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.392
I ain't doing nothing
until I know my friends are OK.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.478
So we're friends now, huh?

19:10.107 --> 19:12.526
Do it now or the rope comes up.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.830
Howdy, boys, thanks for the rescue.

19:24.914 --> 19:29.000
Everything is cool, we had a talk and
they believe we were on the plane too.

19:29.085 --> 19:32.879
Swell. I guess we can all sue
Oceanic together.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.800
What you got there?

19:38.261 --> 19:41.763
- Nothing.
- A rock? Looking for some revenge?

19:41.848 --> 19:44.349
- You got three seconds to drop it.
- Ana.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.768
One, two...

19:46.853 --> 19:48.478
Now, hold on...

19:48.563 --> 19:50.230
Hey, what's...

19:55.027 --> 19:56.945
You didn't say "three."

19:57.029 --> 20:00.282
Shut up. When I tell you
to do something, you do it.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.577
I say move, you move.
I say stop, you stop.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.162
- I say jump, what do you say?
- "You first."

20:07.123 --> 20:10.584
You don't like the rules, I toss
your ass back in the pit right now.

20:10.668 --> 20:11.668
You understand?

20:13.254 --> 20:15.171
I understand.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.473
It's getting dark. We're moving out.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.395
- Moving out where?
- What did I just tell you?

20:32.148 --> 20:35.233
Sorry. Forgot. Just one thing, though.

20:36.611 --> 20:39.529
You hit me again, I'll kill you.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.285
Let's go.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.109
He pushed that button every 108 minutes?

21:19.195 --> 21:22.948
- He did indeed.
- How is that possible? Didn't he sleep?

21:23.032 --> 21:25.909
Don't know.
I didn't get a chance to ask him.

21:26.744 --> 21:29.996
After all that time, he just
up and left? Why? Where'd he go?

21:30.081 --> 21:31.915
Don't know.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.043
I tried to track him,
but he didn't leave much of a trail.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.545
I guess he'd found his replacements.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.965
- Meaning us?
- Meaning us.

21:42.051 --> 21:46.054
It sounds a bit... nutty, doesn't it?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.474
It is what it is, Charlie.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.143
And what happens if we don't push it?

21:52.228 --> 21:55.146
We're not going to find out.
I'm setting up a system.

21:55.231 --> 21:59.818
I'm still working on it, but looks like
two-person shifts every six hours or so.

21:59.902 --> 22:03.154
Shifts. Pushing a button?

22:04.240 --> 22:06.616
Oh, and there's a record player.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.582
What's Hurley been doing there?

22:14.667 --> 22:17.085
He's in charge of the food.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.879
Food?

22:33.269 --> 22:35.103
Hey, mate.

22:36.230 --> 22:40.442
- Where you been?
- Hey. I've been... around.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.610
I know, Hurley.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.531
- You know what?
- I know about the food.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.992
- Locke told me everything.
- Locke's lying.

22:49.076 --> 22:53.329
About the button we have to push every
108 minutes or the island explodes?

22:53.414 --> 22:55.707
- It's not gonna explode.
- Ah!

22:56.459 --> 22:58.710
- Come on.
- Look, Jack put me in charge.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.880
- I don't even want to...
- Is there peanut butter?

23:01.964 --> 23:04.674
- What?
- Peanut butter. Nutty? Creamy?

23:04.759 --> 23:07.010
Staple of children everywhere?

23:07.094 --> 23:09.554
Yeah, a couple jars.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.182
Brilliant. How about you give us one?

23:13.934 --> 23:15.435
It's for Claire.

23:16.812 --> 23:20.982
- No can do, man.
- You're saying no to a nursing mother?

23:21.067 --> 23:23.193
- It's not like that.
- It's exactly like that.

23:23.277 --> 23:26.905
I never thought this would happen,
but you've become one of them.

23:26.989 --> 23:30.575
- One of them?
- Them. The man. Management.

23:31.619 --> 23:34.788
I thought we were friends.
You've changed, man.

23:39.585 --> 23:45.840
You are everybody

23:45.925 --> 23:49.260
- Acting like you're stupid
- Exactly like you're people

23:50.054 --> 23:53.431
- Wearing your clothes and whatnot...
- Wearing expensive something...

23:53.516 --> 23:56.518
Drive Shaft... More like Suck Shaft.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.771
I'm gonna go check out the headphones.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.358
Sure. Headphones.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.653
- Hugo.
- Starla.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.822
Why aren't you chuckleheads at work?

24:08.906 --> 24:11.616
We're currently exploring
other opportunities.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.785
- You quit?
- I did.

24:13.869 --> 24:18.081
He's mixing it up today. He's off the
rails. Somebody get a straightjacket!

24:18.165 --> 24:21.960
- Hey, can I try those on?
- You're messing with my world-view.

24:22.044 --> 24:25.004
You're my rock.
I mean, if you quit your job,

24:25.089 --> 24:29.217
the next thing you know, bees will stop
making honey, and flowers will die,

24:29.301 --> 24:32.053
and, hell,
the whole damn thing will fall apart.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.390
So, Starla...

24:40.104 --> 24:42.814
Sorry. Uh, well...

24:42.898 --> 24:46.943
The Hold Steady's
playing the Troubadour this weekend.

24:47.069 --> 24:51.656
- And I was wondering, maybe Friday...
- Oh, I have to work.

24:52.783 --> 24:56.411
- Oh, no, I didn't mean...
- I can probably go Saturday. That cool?

24:58.831 --> 25:01.207
Yeah. That's totally cool.

25:03.419 --> 25:06.588
You've been crushing on her
for months and doing nothing.

25:06.672 --> 25:10.967
Today, you're fricking Fabio! Seriously,
man, what has gotten into you?

25:11.051 --> 25:13.887
Nothing. I just wanted
to ask her out before...

25:13.971 --> 25:16.347
- Before what?
- Nothing.

25:18.601 --> 25:23.021
This is the last duct. I believe we're
under the area where we began.

25:23.898 --> 25:27.025
They've poured concrete
all the way down here, too.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.283
Just as thick.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.911
Maybe there's a way around it.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.336
What is all this stuff?

25:46.420 --> 25:51.299
My best guess? There's a geothermal
generator behind this wall.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.635
That's the power source.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.480
Careful with these pipes.
They're very hot.

26:10.861 --> 26:14.697
That's it. Nothing. It's blocked.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.912
So, what do you think, Sayid?

26:22.623 --> 26:26.334
- What do I think about what, Jack?
- This place, the computer.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.170
What do you think is going on?

26:30.422 --> 26:34.634
The last time I heard of concrete being
poured over everything in this way...

26:34.718 --> 26:36.469
...was Chernobyl.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.436
- Did you hit something?
- I don't think so.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.857
It's coming from over there.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.403
I'm gonna check it out.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.758
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.847
You took a shower.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.099
Had to see if it worked.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.061
How was it?

27:29.440 --> 27:32.608
Pressure sucked
and it kind of went cold at one point,

27:32.693 --> 27:36.654
and it smelled a little bit
like sulfur, but it was a shower.

27:36.739 --> 27:38.948
Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.077
You could use one.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.830
Maybe a little later.

27:46.874 --> 27:49.000
I'll leave the shampoo for you.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.059
- I'm Libby.
- Michael.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.980
How many of you? You know,
on the other side of the island?

28:11.815 --> 28:14.692
When we left, around 40.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.988
How many of you survived?

28:19.073 --> 28:21.032
Twenty-three of us.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.793
Are you all right?

28:32.628 --> 28:35.338
Now you give a damn.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.758
I said I'm sorry.
It was a misunderstanding.

28:39.593 --> 28:43.388
A misunderstanding is when you bring me
lemonade instead of iced tea.

28:43.472 --> 28:47.058
- I said no talking.
- He was talking to me!

28:47.142 --> 28:49.310
We're here.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.898
What are you gonna do, beam us up?

29:48.829 --> 29:51.289
I thought you said
there were 23 of you.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.417
There were.

30:15.522 --> 30:16.814
Hi, Sun.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.154
What's wrong?

30:26.241 --> 30:28.826
I found something out in the water.

30:28.911 --> 30:33.748
And I told Shannon about it,
and we thought you should know...

30:41.256 --> 30:43.716
It's the messages from the raft.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.723
We thought you should decide what to do.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.025
Why did you tell Charlie, man?

31:01.818 --> 31:04.612
- Because he asked, Hugo.
- You shouldn't have.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.908
You should have listened to me about
coming down here. It's all gonna change.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.911
- Everything.
- Change is good, Hugo.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.790
You know, people say that,
but it's not true, man.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.876
Trust me, I know.
And guess who gets to be the bad guy?

31:18.961 --> 31:22.380
Who says, "No, you can't have
peanut butter for the cute blonde

31:22.464 --> 31:25.967
and her poor island baby."
You know who? It's me.

31:28.470 --> 31:32.473
You know what? I'm not gonna do it.
Find someone else to deal with the chow.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.517
No, we all have our jobs, Hugo.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.979
Mine is to convince people
to push a button every 108 minutes

31:38.063 --> 31:40.398
without them knowing why or for what.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.736
- Wanna trade?
- I don't wanna do this, man.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.947
I've had lots of jobs
I didn't want to do.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.241
But I still did them.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.410
I'm sorry, Hugo,

31:53.829 --> 31:55.955
you don't get to quit.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.335
OK, then.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.702
- Be careful!
- Dude. I am.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.330
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.665
All right. Let's go!

32:43.211 --> 32:45.963
- Do you think we got enough gnomes?
- We're good.

32:52.220 --> 32:55.056
- This is genius.
- No, no, to the left, dude.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.308
- More of an angle.
- Hey!

32:57.392 --> 32:58.517
Run!

33:06.902 --> 33:08.736
Cluck you, Randy!

33:10.989 --> 33:13.491
Freedom!

33:13.575 --> 33:15.618
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Freedom!

33:16.703 --> 33:18.996
So anything else you wanna do tonight?

33:19.081 --> 33:23.376
You better let me know now, because our
day off is just about over, Huggy Bear.

33:24.127 --> 33:28.339
In about ten hours we're gonna have
to find ourselves some new employment.

33:28.423 --> 33:33.678
I hear Pizza Bin is hiring.
Or we could try our luck at Gyro-rama.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.263
I do kind of dig the chick
who works at the Bin.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.850
Dude, promise me something.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.103
OK, what?

33:42.187 --> 33:46.816
Promise me that no matter what happens,
we'll never change.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.734
This'll never change.

33:48.819 --> 33:52.363
OK. Oh! I know what this is about.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.324
I know why you've been
acting so weird lately.

33:55.409 --> 34:00.204
You're getting that stomach-stapling
surgery thing, aren't you?

34:00.288 --> 34:02.832
- I'm not getting surgery.
- Come on, it's cool.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.667
I can still be all surprised,

34:04.751 --> 34:08.504
I can be like,
"Ooh, my, Hurley. Wow, is that you?"

34:08.588 --> 34:10.880
Listen, Johnny, I'm serious.

34:10.966 --> 34:16.053
Promise me that you and I
will always stay the same.

34:16.138 --> 34:21.183
I'll do you one better. Not only will I
stay gold, Ponyboy, I will drink to it.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.103
Can I borrow two bucks?

34:43.331 --> 34:45.498
What you got there, Hurley?

34:49.963 --> 34:51.755
It's dynamite.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.632
Dynamite?
Well, what are you doing with it?

34:57.554 --> 35:00.055
I'm sorry.
But I can't let it happen again.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.693
Why is there a news crew here?

35:14.029 --> 35:16.363
Dude, we shouldn't go here.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.950
Dude, let's go,
they jack the prices here.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.702
Maybe somebody got shot.

35:24.206 --> 35:28.292
Yeah, one guy.
And I was there, you know.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.628
I was right next to him.

35:34.591 --> 35:37.009
Why are you doing this, honey?

35:37.093 --> 35:41.180
- Look, just get out of here, Rose.
- But you're gonna hurt somebody.

35:41.264 --> 35:44.099
Not if I do it from outside the door.
It's thick.

35:44.184 --> 35:48.479
And I'll make sure there's nobody around
first. So, please, will you just go?

35:48.563 --> 35:52.191
Uh-uh. You haul me off the beach
and you drag me into this place,

35:52.275 --> 35:55.736
the least I can get is an explanation
before you blow it up.

35:55.821 --> 35:59.323
You don't get it.
This is gonna mess it all up!

36:05.205 --> 36:07.748
Dude! Somebody won the lottery!

36:07.833 --> 36:13.838
Let me tell you something, Rose. We were
all fine before we had any potato chips.

36:14.256 --> 36:17.758
Now we've got these potato chips,
everyone's gonna want them.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.135
So, Steve gets them, Charlie's pissed,

36:20.220 --> 36:22.763
but not pissed at Steve,
he's pissed at me.

36:22.848 --> 36:27.810
That's the guy!

36:32.023 --> 36:34.024
And I'm gonna be in the middle of it.

36:34.109 --> 36:38.737
And then it's gonna be, "What about us?"
"Why didn't I get any potato chips?"

36:38.822 --> 36:41.866
"Help us out, Hurley.
Why did you give Kate the shampoo?"

36:41.950 --> 36:44.034
"Why didn't I get the peanut butter?"

36:44.119 --> 36:47.162
Then they'll get really mad
and start asking,

36:47.247 --> 36:50.749
"Why does Hugo have everything?
Why should he get to decide?"

36:50.834 --> 36:53.127
Then they'll all hate me.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.466
I don't know what to do.

37:24.951 --> 37:28.120
Come on, Jack, the inventory's done.
This is the only way.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.914
Are you serious?

37:29.998 --> 37:31.957
Dude, there's enough food in there

37:32.042 --> 37:35.294
to feed one guy three meals a day
for another three months.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.505
We have 40 people.
It's just not gonna work.

37:39.341 --> 37:42.134
Look, you put me in charge,
this is what we're doing.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.846
OK.

37:47.515 --> 37:51.060
- OK?
- Yeah. OK.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.275
OK.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.425
Excuse me.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.719
Hi.

41:14.681 --> 41:18.475
Back where you guys...
where you came from...

41:19.727 --> 41:22.187
...is there a woman named Rose there?

41:24.440 --> 41:26.275
Black chick in her 50s?

41:30.738 --> 41:32.614
Is she...

41:32.699 --> 41:34.366
Is she OK?

41:35.910 --> 41:38.996
Yeah, man. She's OK.

41:42.959 --> 41:45.127
Oh, thank you.

41:46.129 --> 41:48.130
Michael. I'm Michael.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.466
Thank you, Michael.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.344
I'm Bernard.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.938
OK.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.232
It's OK. She's good.
