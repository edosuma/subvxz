00:13.750 --> 00:15.792
DANIEL:  I was driving
to work this morning
thinking I will be here,

00:15.792 --> 00:18.125
in two months,
it'll be 10 years.

00:18.125 --> 00:21.625
And you're like
my real family.
Isn't that tragic?

00:21.625 --> 00:23.041
(ALL LAUGH)

00:24.834 --> 00:26.458
I got a call from my mother
this morning who wished me
a happy birthday

00:26.458 --> 00:29.542
and hinted around the fact
that I wasn't making
enough money.

00:29.542 --> 00:32.750
If you can call, "Are you
still making the same salary,
honey?" a hint.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.208
(ALL LAUGH)

00:34.208 --> 00:36.417
And my ex-wife used to
say the same thing

00:36.417 --> 00:38.083
although she never used
the word "honey."

00:39.166 --> 00:42.000
So maybe in three years,
I can double my income?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.125
Good luck.

00:43.125 --> 00:44.250
Four years?
Maybe.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.333
Okay.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.333
So you're great people
to work with

00:47.333 --> 00:49.500
and this is
a great present.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.959
And I wish I could
squeeze all of you
into one pretty woman.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.917
And if you'd like to go
into my office, I'll try.

00:56.166 --> 00:57.333
Thanks a lot.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.792
(ALL APPLAUDING)

01:06.333 --> 01:07.875
I'll be home in an hour.
WOMAN:  Why?

01:07.875 --> 01:09.166
I'm taking Daniel
to get his new car.

01:09.166 --> 01:10.834
I'm starving.
All right.

01:10.834 --> 01:12.792
What'd he get?
BMW convertible.

01:12.792 --> 01:14.625
Oh, my God. Leather?

01:14.625 --> 01:16.166
Leather?
Oh, yeah.

01:16.166 --> 01:17.291
Yeah.
I want one.

01:17.291 --> 01:18.667
All right.
Kiss Alex for me.

01:18.667 --> 01:19.792
I want one.

01:19.792 --> 01:20.875
She says,
"Happy birthday."

01:20.875 --> 01:22.834
Hey, these are
really great.
Thanks a million.

01:22.834 --> 01:25.166
Just stuff I like.
DANIEL: It's great.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.875
Why do you drive this?

01:27.875 --> 01:29.125
What?
I'm curious.

01:29.125 --> 01:30.875
I see people driving
these things.

01:30.875 --> 01:33.375
What do you know
that I don't?
Or flood's coming?

01:33.375 --> 01:35.208
Hoover Dam broke?
What's going on?

01:35.208 --> 01:36.375
I like this car.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.667
It's not a car.
It's a battering ram.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.583
This is what
Patton drove.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.708
(IMITATING PATTON)
Hey, you, soldier,
follow us.

01:42.708 --> 01:45.542
Make fun, but
in an 8.5 earthquake,
you'll beg for a Jeep.

01:45.542 --> 01:47.792
In an 8.5 earthquake,
I'll beg for a coffin.

01:47.792 --> 01:48.792
(CHUCKLES)

01:49.959 --> 01:51.000
So what are you
doing tonight?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.667
I'm gonna take
a long drive.

01:52.667 --> 01:53.792
Alone?

01:53.792 --> 01:55.000
Unless somebody
comes with the car.

01:56.208 --> 01:57.834
You don't want to be alone
on your birthday.

01:57.834 --> 01:59.542
What better day to be alone?

01:59.542 --> 02:01.291
I don't have that hang-up
like other people do

02:01.291 --> 02:03.583
about your birthday
and parties.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.750
You are born alone,
you should celebrate it.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.667
Celebrate aloneness.
That's what birthdays are for.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.542
Yeah, I never thought
of it like that.

02:10.542 --> 02:12.166
It's a pitiful theory.

02:12.708 --> 02:13.875
CAR SALESMAN:
Yeah, sure.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.041
WOMAN ON PHONE:
Look, I've had
these cars before

02:15.041 --> 02:17.041
and I know there's
something wrong.
Mmm-hmm.

02:17.250 --> 02:18.875
The smell is making me sick.

02:19.291 --> 02:21.500
That's a normal smell,
Mrs. Bernstein.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.250
That's a protective coating,
it's not oil burning.

02:24.250 --> 02:25.583
I think it's oil.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.875
You look fantastic.
You lose weight?

02:26.875 --> 02:27.917
Did I what?

02:27.917 --> 02:29.583
No, I was talking
to someone else.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.750
Did any of the lights
come on the dash, dear?

02:31.750 --> 02:33.208
I don't think so.

02:33.208 --> 02:34.542
Well, that means you're okay.

02:34.542 --> 02:36.667
If there's any trouble,
they come on.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.750
Mrs. Bernstein,
we have a little
saying around here.

02:38.750 --> 02:42.583
"If you really smell something
and don't see lights,
try dry cleaning."

02:42.583 --> 02:44.041
Try what?

02:44.041 --> 02:45.500
She has no sense of humor.

02:45.875 --> 02:46.875
Dry cleaning?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.250
Yeah, uh,
tell you what.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.917
If it smells on Monday,
you bring it in.

02:49.917 --> 02:51.583
I'm very worried.
I'm sure it's nothing.

02:51.583 --> 02:52.959
Well, I'm sure
it's something.

02:52.959 --> 02:54.375
Okay.
I'm on my way in.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.750
Trouble with one
of the new cars?

02:56.750 --> 02:58.291
Oh, no.
She's a lunatic.

02:58.291 --> 03:00.083
Boy, you have lost
a lot of weight!

03:00.083 --> 03:01.750
How could I lose
a lot of weight?

03:01.750 --> 03:02.875
You saw me three days ago.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.708
You look different.
Why? What is it?

03:04.708 --> 03:06.000
I don't know.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.583
I just wrote you
a check for $39,000.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.959
Ah, that's it.
That's the look.

03:09.959 --> 03:11.291
39 grand lighter.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.792
Let's go get it, huh?

03:12.792 --> 03:14.250
Let's get her. Whoo!

03:16.792 --> 03:18.083
Hey, what do you
got in the box?

03:18.083 --> 03:19.792
It's my birthday.
They gave me a
compact disk player.

03:19.792 --> 03:21.083
Hey, happy birthday.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.458
You got a CD
player in the car.

03:22.458 --> 03:23.583
No, I don't.

03:23.583 --> 03:24.792
You paid for it.
No, I didn't.

03:24.792 --> 03:26.250
You said you wanted
the best radio.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.875
The best radio
comes with a CD.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.250
Don't worry.
You'll love it.

03:30.291 --> 03:31.583
There she is.

03:31.583 --> 03:32.959
Wow.
It's gorgeous!

03:33.542 --> 03:35.834
Look at it.
It looks huge!

03:35.834 --> 03:37.959
It's beautiful!
Beautiful.

03:37.959 --> 03:40.125
That's not it.
That's a 750.
That's it.

03:41.333 --> 03:42.417
What a cutie.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.959
Gee, try not to show
the 750 first.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.708
My car looks like a turd now.

03:46.708 --> 03:47.834
I'm gonna level
with you.

03:47.834 --> 03:49.208
If I had to choose between
this car and yours,

03:49.208 --> 03:50.792
I'd take yours every time.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.917
You're an idiot, Jim.

Good afternoon,
and welcome to
Judgment City.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.500
You've just had
quite a little journey,

07:56.500 --> 07:58.834
so for now, relax
and enjoy the ride.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.917
Considering the transformation
you've just been through,

08:01.917 --> 08:03.417
you really won't have
any choice.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.291
Now, if we've done our
work correctly,

08:06.291 --> 08:09.417
you should all be from
the western half of
the United States.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.208
Even though this
isn't the Earth,

08:12.208 --> 08:15.708
our surroundings
should seem pleasing
and very familiar to you.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.834
Exactly why you're here

08:17.834 --> 08:21.667
and what you'll be doing
will be explained later.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.583
No need to worry
about that now.

08:24.458 --> 08:27.417
Soon we will be
dropping you off
at your hotel.

08:27.417 --> 08:30.041
You will sleep the night
and tomorrow when you wake,

08:30.041 --> 08:32.417
you'll feel wonderful
and raring to go.

08:32.958 --> 08:36.207
You'll find many activities
for your enjoyment
here in Judgment City.

08:36.707 --> 08:37.750

08:37.750 --> 08:39.375
how many like
to play golf?

08:41.457 --> 08:43.457
You won't be able to get
your hands up just yet,

08:43.457 --> 08:47.083
but good, we have three
championship golf courses.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.250
So sit back
and have fun.

08:49.959 --> 08:52.333
You're all gonna be here
for the next five days

08:52.333 --> 08:54.083
and we want you to
enjoy yourselves.

this is the Continental Hotel.

09:06.333 --> 09:09.291

escorted from the tram.

09:09.291 --> 09:12.500

depart momentarily.

Because of what
you've just been through,

09:22.291 --> 09:25.250
you'll want to go
directly to your room
and go fast asleep.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.625
You're already checked in.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.959

worry about tonight.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.417

explained to you
in the morning.

you'll need for the time
you're here is in this closet.

They're like caftans.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.792
They're quite comfortable
and they fit everyone.

10:22.792 --> 10:25.500
Would you like to shower,
or are you too tired?

10:28.708 --> 10:29.708
You're too tired?

10:32.208 --> 10:34.208
I understand.
There are five channels

10:34.208 --> 10:36.083

10:36.375 --> 10:38.875

anything for you,
I'm at your service.

I'd be very surprised if
you found anything in there,

Yes.
Amazing, isn't it?

Listen, you're gonna get up,
get showered,

12:35.792 --> 12:37.542
you're gonna put on
some of those nice clothes,

12:37.542 --> 12:39.208
you're gonna take
a tram downtown

12:39.208 --> 12:41.166
and you're gonna come
see me this morning.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.667
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

12:44.542 --> 12:45.542
No.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.667
Well, in a nutshell,
you're here to
defend your life,

12:48.667 --> 12:50.000
and I'm going
to help you.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.500
Defend my life?

you're going to be smarter
than anyone you've ever met.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.500
Sound exciting?

Oh.

Well, I'll tell you
about my dog.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.166

Yeah, go ahead.

on the train
in those days.

in the baggage car.

the conductor was
coming around,

17:57.834 --> 17:59.083
he knew it.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.917
And he would crawl down
in the corner of the bag.

Did you ever
have a dog?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.458

What did you say?
Yes.

What did I say?

You said
it's wonderful.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.208

doesn't it?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.375

Well, that's how
it was designed,

We'd like to hear from you.

You know, if you really
want to make this whole place
seem more like Earth,

18:43.458 --> 18:45.834
you should start building
some of those mini malls.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.333
You know, it's funny
you should say that.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.000
Six of them opened up
just outside of town.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.542
I hear they're lovely.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.083
Personally, I don't think
I would use them

18:53.083 --> 18:56.208

19:53.959 --> 19:55.041
Thanks.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.583
So, is this what you
thought it would be?

19:59.166 --> 20:02.291
Thought  what
would be?
Where am I? Is this heaven?

20:02.291 --> 20:03.875
No, it isn't heaven.

20:03.875 --> 20:04.959
Is it hell?

20:04.959 --> 20:06.583
No, it isn't hell either.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.417
Actually, there is no hell.

20:08.417 --> 20:11.333
Although I hear
Los Angeles is getting
pretty close.

20:12.125 --> 20:14.000
(LAUGHS)

20:15.333 --> 20:16.500
Well, Daniel,

20:16.500 --> 20:17.959
let me tell you
what's going on.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.125
When you're born
into this universe,

20:21.125 --> 20:23.083
you're in it for a long,
long time.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.959
You have many
different lifetimes,

20:25.959 --> 20:27.500
and after
each lifetime,

20:27.500 --> 20:29.917
there's
an examining period,
which you're in now.

20:30.667 --> 20:35.667
You see, every second
of every lifetime
is always recorded,

20:35.667 --> 20:38.250
and as each one ends,
we sort of look at it--

20:38.583 --> 20:41.250
look at a few
of the days,
examine it.

20:41.792 --> 20:44.250
And then
if everybody agrees,
you move forward.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.291
What do you mean,
move forward?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.667
I mean move forward.
Continue onward.

20:48.667 --> 20:52.166
The point of this whole thing
is to keep getting smarter,

20:52.166 --> 20:53.542
to keep growing,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.208
to use as much of
your brain as possible.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.333
For example, I use
48% of my brain.

20:58.333 --> 20:59.875
Do you know
how much you use?

21:01.834 --> 21:03.000
47?

21:04.375 --> 21:05.375
3.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm sorry?

21:07.208 --> 21:08.208
3.

21:08.708 --> 21:10.000
I use 3% of my brain?

21:10.208 --> 21:11.500
Yes. Don't worry
about it.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.000
Everybody on Earth
uses 3% of their brain.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.000
3 to 5%.
That's why they're there.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.500
Three? 3%? 3%?

21:20.083 --> 21:22.333
You mean nobody on Earth
uses more than that?

21:22.333 --> 21:24.500
When you use more than
5% of your brain,

21:24.500 --> 21:26.667
you don't want
to be on Earth,
believe me.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.834
Well, not that your take-out
places are lovely,

21:28.834 --> 21:32.041
but there are more
exciting destinations
for smarter people.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.875
Now, being from Earth
as you are

21:34.875 --> 21:37.708
and using as little of
your brain as you do,

21:38.333 --> 21:41.792
your life has pretty much
been devoted to dealing
with fear.

21:41.792 --> 21:42.875
It has?

21:43.166 --> 21:45.667
Well, everybody on
Earth deals with fear.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.208
That's what Little Brains do.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.041
What are "Little Brains"?

21:50.375 --> 21:52.834
That's what we call you folks
behind your back.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.500
Well, I'm just like you.

22:04.208 --> 22:06.166
I was on Earth
a long time ago.

22:06.834 --> 22:10.500
But I advanced,
I moved forward.
I got over my fears.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.000
And I got smarter.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.792
Did you have friends
whose stomachs hurt?

22:13.792 --> 22:15.792
Every one of them.
It's fear.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.291
Fear is like
a giant fog.

22:18.291 --> 22:20.875
It sits on your brain
and blocks everything--

22:20.875 --> 22:24.750
real feelings,
true happiness,
real joy.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.750
They can't get
through that fog.

22:27.250 --> 22:28.917
But you lift it,

22:28.917 --> 22:32.250
and, buddy, you're in for
the ride of your life.

22:32.959 --> 22:34.917
God, my 3% is swimming.

22:39.542 --> 22:40.750
What are you reading?

22:40.750 --> 22:41.917
You wouldn't
understand this.

22:41.917 --> 22:43.625
Just numbers.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.583
You read numbers?
Yes, sir.

22:46.750 --> 22:49.291
So I'm on trial
for being afraid?

22:49.291 --> 22:51.500
First of all, I don't like
to call it a "trial."

22:51.500 --> 22:52.875
Second of all, yes.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.417
Well, what if I'm guilty,
what happens to me?

22:56.417 --> 22:58.458
Don't think
"innocent" or "guilty."

22:58.458 --> 23:01.708
Worse comes to worse,
you'll go back to Earth
and you'll try it again.

23:01.708 --> 23:04.250
Well, what do you do?
You just keep going back
until you get it right?

23:04.250 --> 23:05.959
Well, you don't
keep going back.

23:05.959 --> 23:07.792
Eventually, they'll
throw you away.

23:09.458 --> 23:11.250
Have I been to
Earth before?
Oh, yeah.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.458
How many times?
Approaching 20.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.000
Is that a lot?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.250
I was there six.

23:16.250 --> 23:17.458
Oh, my God!

23:17.458 --> 23:19.375
So I'm the dunce
of the universe.

23:19.375 --> 23:20.500
Don't be silly.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.792
We've had people
who've been there
100 times.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.333
I wouldn't
want to hang out
with any of them,

23:24.333 --> 23:25.792
but we've seen them.

23:26.458 --> 23:30.208
If you're defending me,
is there a prosecutor?

23:30.208 --> 23:32.500
Damn good one.
Lena Foster.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.792
We call her
"The Dragon Lady."

23:36.166 --> 23:38.333
That's our prosecutor?
Mmm-hmm.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.708
Who does she work for?

23:39.708 --> 23:41.166
The universe.

23:41.166 --> 23:44.166
You see, the Universe
is like a big machine,
and you and I are parts.

23:44.166 --> 23:46.542
Now they don't want
a part to get through
unless it's ready.

23:46.542 --> 23:47.875
A bad part
gets through

23:47.875 --> 23:50.125
and the whole
machine breaks down.

23:50.125 --> 23:51.959
So that's what
we're here for,

23:51.959 --> 23:53.208
to make sure
you're ready.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.166
So what do they want
to look at exactly?

23:55.542 --> 23:56.875
I can't tell you
that exactly.

23:56.875 --> 24:00.125
But I can tell you
it's nine days
from your life.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.166
Nine days?

24:02.166 --> 24:04.917
So my trial goes
on for nine days?

24:04.917 --> 24:07.208
No. All the trials
go on for four days.

24:07.208 --> 24:09.250
Over that time, we're
looking at nine days,

24:09.250 --> 24:11.000
or episodes
from your life.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.667
Which days? Tell me that.

24:12.667 --> 24:13.875
I'm not allowed.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.166
Is that a normal number?

24:15.166 --> 24:17.208
High? Low? Is that
a good number? Normal?

24:17.875 --> 24:20.083
You're very concerned
about normal, aren't you?

24:20.083 --> 24:21.583
Kind of cute.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.792
I'd prefer seven,
but nine's fine.

24:23.792 --> 24:25.250
Some people have 12.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.417
Say, you're hungry?
Starving.

24:27.417 --> 24:28.917
I had one bite,
then I got on the tram.

24:28.917 --> 24:32.208
Well, Mr. All-You-Can-Eat,
let's stuff. Come on.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.208
DANIEL: Mmm! Mm!

24:38.208 --> 24:40.834
We have about
400,000 residents here.

24:40.834 --> 24:43.000
We service half
of the United States' dead.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.083
That's about
2,500 people a day.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.083
Good.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.000
Do children
come here?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.542
Children don't have
to defend themselves.

24:51.542 --> 24:54.708
When a child is taken,
they automatically
move forward.

24:54.708 --> 24:55.917
Isn't that nice?

24:55.917 --> 24:57.834
Mmm, what about
teenagers?

24:57.834 --> 24:59.625
Too much trouble.
They go elsewhere.

24:59.625 --> 25:02.333
We tried for a while,
but they damaged the tupas.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.083
Too rowdy.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.792
What about your chicken?
How do you like?

25:05.792 --> 25:07.250
Oh, delicious.
Yeah.

25:13.417 --> 25:14.917
Mmm.
What are you eating?

25:14.917 --> 25:17.291
Oh, you wouldn't
like this. (CHUCKLES)

25:17.291 --> 25:19.417
What is it?
What does it taste like?

25:20.500 --> 25:22.250
You're curious,
aren't you?

25:22.250 --> 25:23.875
Good! I like
that about you.

25:24.917 --> 25:26.458
You want to try?
Yeah.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.250
It looks so weird.

25:30.583 --> 25:31.625
(SPITS)

25:31.625 --> 25:32.708
(LAUGHS)

25:33.417 --> 25:34.583
Oh, my God.

25:34.583 --> 25:35.917
A little like
horse shit, huh?

25:35.917 --> 25:36.959
(GAGS)

25:37.750 --> 25:40.583
As you get smarter,
you manipulate your senses.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.917
This tastes much
different to me,
than it does to you.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.667
Ooh! (GAGS)

25:44.667 --> 25:46.458
This is what
smart people eat?

25:47.834 --> 25:49.291
So talk to me, Daniel.

25:49.291 --> 25:50.500
Tell me about your life.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.792
You feel you had
any problems?

25:53.708 --> 25:55.500
Well, sure I had
some problems.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.000
Everybody has
problems, don't they?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.667
Everybody on earth.
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

26:00.667 --> 26:02.583
Did you give
a lot to charity?

26:03.125 --> 26:04.792
What do you
mean a lot?

26:04.792 --> 26:07.000
A lot of money.
Did you donate things?

26:07.500 --> 26:09.125
This isn't
a good or bad thing.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.000
It's just merely
my curiosity.

26:12.083 --> 26:14.125
Well, I mean, I'm sure
I could have given more.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.458
I gave a lot to people
on the street,

26:18.458 --> 26:19.625
but you never
get a receipt.

26:22.667 --> 26:24.125
How much do
you have to give?

26:24.125 --> 26:25.500
What's the total?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.166
Don't worry about it.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.208
Relax!

26:29.667 --> 26:34.208
But there was one person
you were really cheap
with over and over again.

26:34.208 --> 26:36.166
I wish you'd been
more generous with him.

26:36.166 --> 26:37.166
Who?

26:37.750 --> 26:38.875
You.

26:38.875 --> 26:41.166
Well, I got to go.
I'm late.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.208
Where do you go now?

26:42.708 --> 26:44.417
You wouldn't understand.

26:44.417 --> 26:45.875
I don't mean
that as an insult.

26:45.875 --> 26:47.708
I mean it literally.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.834
Get out tonight.
Have some fun.

26:50.834 --> 26:52.667
Say, you know
what you might try?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.166
Get over the
past lives pavilion.

26:55.166 --> 26:56.291
What is that?

26:56.291 --> 26:58.875
It's where
you see the people
you've been before.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.458
What?
Yeah.

27:00.458 --> 27:02.375
You see yourself
in other lives?
Yeah.

27:02.375 --> 27:04.959
Most people love it.
But some
it makes nauseous.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.125
(LAUGHS)

27:06.125 --> 27:08.208
Don't worry about it.

27:08.208 --> 27:10.667
All right. Take care.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.708
Listen, you
like that chicken?

27:12.708 --> 27:13.875
You want to
take it with you?

27:13.875 --> 27:16.000
They love putting things
in bags around here.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.083
If you need to talk
to me at any time,

27:18.083 --> 27:19.250
just call me up.

27:19.250 --> 27:21.208
I never sleep.
Never?

27:23.458 --> 27:25.041
Well, I had
another question.
See ya'.

27:25.041 --> 27:26.667
Okay, I'll call you later.

27:38.750 --> 27:39.875
MAN:  Already checked in.

27:39.875 --> 27:42.458
You have nothing
to worry about tonight.

27:42.458 --> 27:43.625
(SCOFFS)

27:43.625 --> 27:45.625
Everything will be explained
to you in the morning.

27:45.625 --> 27:47.041
Have a good rest.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.708
If you have any questions,
I'm here to help.

27:49.708 --> 27:50.750
Thank you.

27:58.250 --> 27:59.875
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

28:21.083 --> 28:22.750
If I told you
how old this man was,

28:22.750 --> 28:24.250
you wouldn't believe me.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.166
Should I tell them?
Huh? Should I?

28:26.166 --> 28:28.125
We're talking light-years.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.625
Light-years.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.333
He looks good, though.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.458
No prostate,
but he looks fine.

28:33.458 --> 28:34.959
(MAN LAUGHS)

28:35.792 --> 28:37.834
Come on.
You're looking at me
like stunned sheep.

28:37.834 --> 28:39.166
Come on, folks.

28:39.166 --> 28:40.500
What is this, a white sale?

28:40.500 --> 28:41.500
Come on!

28:43.750 --> 28:45.959
Well, folks,
I'm going to
tell you a story.

28:45.959 --> 28:47.500
About a year ago,

28:47.500 --> 28:48.917
this little brain
comes in here.

28:48.917 --> 28:50.583
I'm talking, and
this is documented,

28:50.583 --> 28:53.000
half a percent of
his brain, at the most.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.291
He orders a piece of pie.

28:54.291 --> 28:55.667
He forgets what it is.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.291
(INAUDIBLE)

28:57.291 --> 28:58.959
Well, I know what it is.
I'm looking
and it's a piece of pie.

28:58.959 --> 29:00.792
I say, "What the
hell are you doing?"

29:00.792 --> 29:03.125
He says, "I'm waiting
to make a call."

29:03.125 --> 29:04.667
I say, "Does that
look like a phone?"

29:04.667 --> 29:06.291
He says, "It is a phone."

29:06.291 --> 29:07.500
(CHUCKLES)

29:07.500 --> 29:08.625
Well, the joke was on me.

29:08.625 --> 29:10.125
He picked up the pie,
called his mother.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.333
Folks, come on, please,
stay with me here.

29:14.333 --> 29:15.834
You're on trial,
not me, okay?

29:16.750 --> 29:18.000
Hi. What's your name?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.166
Arthur.

29:19.166 --> 29:21.166
Hi, Arthur,
and where were you from?

29:21.166 --> 29:22.333
Denver.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.041
Lovely city,
Denver, Arthur.

29:24.041 --> 29:25.667
Did you ski?
No.

29:25.667 --> 29:27.166
No.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.333
How'd you die?

29:29.333 --> 29:31.000
I was in a coma.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.542
I'm sorry.
How long were
you in the coma?

29:33.542 --> 29:35.208
I really don't know.

29:36.125 --> 29:37.291
Let's play a game, Art.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.500
Elvis. Living or dead?

29:39.500 --> 29:40.667
Living.

29:40.959 --> 29:42.667
Long coma, Art.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.375
Long coma.

29:44.375 --> 29:45.542
Have a nice day.

29:45.542 --> 29:47.333
Hi. How are you?
What's your name?

29:47.333 --> 29:48.708
Ernie.

29:48.708 --> 29:50.542
Hi, Ernie, you having a good
time here in judgment city?

29:50.834 --> 29:53.208
Oh, it's fun.
Food's good.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.834
Yeah, it is,
isn't it?

29:54.834 --> 29:56.417
Have you been on the stables?
A little exercise?

29:56.417 --> 29:57.917
You like to
horseback ride?

29:57.917 --> 29:59.750
Not very much.

29:59.750 --> 30:00.875
Good.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.542
There's a nice-looking
young man over there.

30:02.542 --> 30:04.000
Hi. How'd you die?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.834
On stage, like you.

30:06.417 --> 30:07.667
(ALL LAUGHING)

30:09.250 --> 30:11.875
Pretty funny. Maybe you
should come up here, huh?

30:11.875 --> 30:13.208
No, thank you.

30:13.208 --> 30:14.875
Of course, he doesn't
want to come up here.

30:14.875 --> 30:16.708
You know why? 'Cause
this is very hard work.

30:16.708 --> 30:19.959
But I love to do it,
and I love you little brains.

30:19.959 --> 30:23.125
As a matter of fact,
have you heard any
new little brain jokes lately?

30:23.125 --> 30:24.417
Hi.
Hi.

30:24.417 --> 30:25.708
I know you, right?

30:25.708 --> 30:27.500
I hope so.
Who are you?

30:27.500 --> 30:29.875
I'm Julia.
Hi. I'm Daniel.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.166
Hi.
You know me?

30:31.917 --> 30:33.417
Well, I thought I did.

30:33.417 --> 30:35.291
You weren't in the bus,
were you?

30:35.291 --> 30:37.083
What bus?
I hit a bus.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.417
Oh, no,
I don't think so.

30:38.417 --> 30:40.208
Oh, good. Sit down.

30:41.417 --> 30:42.542
I'm sorry, I just...

30:42.542 --> 30:44.875
You really look
so familiar to me.

30:44.875 --> 30:46.083
Really?
Yeah.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.542
Maybe because
I'm the only man
in here under a 100.

30:48.542 --> 30:49.750
(LAUGHS)

30:49.750 --> 30:52.375
Yeah, that could be it.

MAN ON PA:
Check the time.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.083
You know, I want to
tell you a true story.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.458
This really happened.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.792
About three months ago,

31:00.792 --> 31:02.041
these six dead
people come in...

31:02.625 --> 31:05.625
Obviously humor
has nothing to do
with brain size.

31:05.625 --> 31:06.917
Obviously.

31:06.917 --> 31:08.875
Do you want to take
a walk or something,

31:08.875 --> 31:11.417
or do you want to
stay, see the show?

31:11.417 --> 31:13.375
Well, I have to.
That's my dad.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.166
I'm kidding.
Oh...

31:20.125 --> 31:22.500
That would be
so sad for me.
That would be awful.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.834
So, the moral of
the story is, folks,

31:27.834 --> 31:29.792
if you gotta fart,
go outside.

31:29.792 --> 31:31.125
Let's go. Please.
Let's just go.

31:31.125 --> 31:33.583
Folks, please.
Please, folks.

31:33.583 --> 31:34.834
You don't wanna
miss the song.

31:34.834 --> 31:36.250
We'll get the record.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.500
Please.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.041
Okay.

31:39.041 --> 31:40.959
Right now,
Ed and I would like
to do a beautiful song.

31:40.959 --> 31:42.291
I know it's one
of your favorites.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.625
We'd like to do it
a little different.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.166
Leave me alone.
I'm dead.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.333
All right.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.166
How many days
are you looking at?

32:36.166 --> 32:37.750
My lawyer says nine.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.000
You call him
a lawyer?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.083
What do you
call yours?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.417
Sam.

32:41.417 --> 32:42.917
You call him
by his first name?

32:42.917 --> 32:45.375
Yeah.
Never occurred

32:45.375 --> 32:47.375
I bet you called
everybody by their
first name, didn't you?

32:47.375 --> 32:49.208
Like, what was your
butcher's name?

32:49.959 --> 32:51.041
Pete.

32:51.041 --> 32:52.583
What about
your mailman?

32:52.583 --> 32:55.041
Jesse. What was
your mailman's name?

32:55.041 --> 32:56.166
I have no idea.

32:56.166 --> 32:57.917
He was coming
to my house
for over a decade,

32:57.917 --> 32:59.708
and I couldn't tell you.

32:59.708 --> 33:02.542
Didn't you get him a Christmas
presents or anything?
Yes. Liquor.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.375
But I just put
it in the box.
Uh-huh.

33:05.125 --> 33:07.041
I don't suppose
you had a butcher?

33:07.041 --> 33:08.875
Steve. Steve Rubin.

33:08.875 --> 33:09.959
Seriously?
Yeah.

33:09.959 --> 33:11.708
Steve?
But he wasn't

33:11.708 --> 33:13.083
He was just a good buddy
who had the equipment

33:13.083 --> 33:14.542
and liked to cut meat.

33:16.875 --> 33:18.834
What? You'd bring him
a steak, he'd cut it.

33:18.834 --> 33:20.375
Chat for a while
and go home.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.542
So, how many days
are you looking at?

33:22.542 --> 33:24.417
Four.
That's all?

33:25.417 --> 33:26.792
I guess that means
you'll go on.

33:26.792 --> 33:27.917
Oh...

33:27.917 --> 33:30.583
I hope so.
Sam thinks so.

33:30.583 --> 33:32.291
Sam does?
Yeah.

33:33.041 --> 33:34.917
I hope you and Sam
are very happy.

33:34.917 --> 33:36.583
I'll write you from hell.

33:39.291 --> 33:40.917
I like this.

33:43.291 --> 33:45.375
Were you married?
Yes.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.625
Children?
No.

33:48.083 --> 33:49.375
What about you?

33:50.208 --> 33:52.834
Well, I had a little girl,
and I adopted a little boy.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.250
How old were they?

33:55.083 --> 33:58.208
Stephanie was seven,
and Adam was nine.

33:58.792 --> 34:00.750
I bet they
miss you, huh?

34:01.667 --> 34:03.583
I'm sure they do.

34:05.375 --> 34:09.291
I miss them,
but I feel okay about it.

34:09.625 --> 34:10.667
Don't you?

34:10.667 --> 34:12.083
Well, I didn't really
know them that well.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.500
No, I mean...

34:13.500 --> 34:15.792
It does... It feels ok.
Doesn't it?
Yeah.

34:16.833 --> 34:18.291
They say they
make it that way

34:18.291 --> 34:19.625
so we can get
down to work,

34:19.625 --> 34:22.000
so we can look at our lives
without any distractions.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.958
I know, my lawyer Bob
told me the same thing.

34:24.958 --> 34:25.958
Yeah?

34:26.958 --> 34:30.291
But wouldn't you
call this a distraction?

34:31.458 --> 34:32.833
Yes.

34:32.833 --> 34:34.625
But isn't eating
all you want
a distraction?

34:34.625 --> 34:35.750
Oh, isn't
that the best?

34:35.750 --> 34:37.125
Isn't that the best?

34:37.125 --> 34:38.500
I had a dream
six months ago

34:38.500 --> 34:40.875
that I would go
to a place where I could
eat as much as I wanted.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.166
And now I'm here!

34:42.166 --> 34:43.583
You think you were
dreaming about this place?

34:43.583 --> 34:45.833
No, no. I think I was
dreaming about sizzler.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.542
There was one
a block from my house.

34:49.667 --> 34:50.667
(SIGHS)

34:51.708 --> 34:53.583
What about
your husband?

34:53.583 --> 34:55.166
Did you have
a good marriage?

34:56.166 --> 34:57.667
Parts of it were okay.

35:00.834 --> 35:02.542
How about your wife?

35:02.542 --> 35:04.875
I got married too young.
That's all I can say.

35:04.875 --> 35:06.291
How old were you?

35:06.291 --> 35:07.333
71.

35:12.208 --> 35:13.333
What did she look like?

35:13.333 --> 35:15.208
Very pretty.
Too pretty.

35:15.208 --> 35:16.583
What do you mean?

35:16.583 --> 35:18.375
Well, I have this theory
that you should be
with another person

35:18.375 --> 35:21.000
who's good-looking
enough to turn you on.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.834
Any excess
brings problems.

35:22.834 --> 35:25.000
She was much
prettier than I needed.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.959
I never heard
that theory before.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.708
So, do you like
your lawyer?
Are you happy with him?

35:29.708 --> 35:31.333
Oh, he's brilliant.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.542
You know how
big his brain is?

35:34.708 --> 35:37.125
I just came from a world
filled with penis envy.

35:37.125 --> 35:38.875
Now I'm in a world
with brain envy.

35:39.542 --> 35:41.417
No. How big
is his brain?

35:43.375 --> 35:44.708
Hmm.

35:50.750 --> 35:52.041
What is this?

35:52.041 --> 35:53.708
It's my hotel.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.041
This is your hotel?

36:02.041 --> 36:03.166
Yeah.

36:03.166 --> 36:04.375
Where are you staying?

36:04.375 --> 36:06.125
Obviously, the place
for people who
weren't generous

36:06.125 --> 36:07.583
and didn't adopt anybody.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.625
I'm at the continental.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.917
Come over.
We'll paint it.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.250
Listen.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.291
Tomorrow after the trials,
you want to have dinner?

36:15.291 --> 36:16.667
Oh, I can't tomorrow.

36:16.667 --> 36:19.083
You can't?
No. I'm sorry.

36:19.083 --> 36:21.333
Well, you can't
have plans already.

36:21.333 --> 36:23.250
What am I supposed to do?
Call you in two weeks?

36:23.250 --> 36:25.625
No. Sam is just having
a small dinner party.

36:25.625 --> 36:28.750
He said that
there are gonna be some
very, very smart people there.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.250
He asked me
if I wanted to go.

36:30.917 --> 36:31.959
Sam again.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.250
I hope you're not
dating your defender.

36:34.250 --> 36:35.917
I just know in
my heart it's wrong.

36:37.959 --> 36:39.750
Well, I'll call you
after the dinner.
Okay.

36:39.750 --> 36:41.458
We could talk on the phone.
Good.

36:41.458 --> 36:43.583
It will give me
time to have sex
with my prosecutor.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.792
Good luck tomorrow.

36:47.792 --> 36:49.041
Thanks.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.500
Good night.
Good night.

37:21.625 --> 37:22.834

37:22.834 --> 37:23.959
Feeling pretty good.

I'm doing okay.

Let's go.

37:28.834 --> 37:30.000
Nervous?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.125
No. Should I be?

37:31.125 --> 37:32.291
I wouldn't be.

37:33.583 --> 37:34.834
What did you
do last night?

37:34.834 --> 37:36.625
I met this
amazing woman.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.708
You met a girl?
You're kidding me.

37:40.875 --> 37:42.583
What are you
laughing at?

37:42.583 --> 37:43.834
It just sounds funny.

37:43.834 --> 37:45.500
Two days after
the car accident,

37:45.500 --> 37:46.959
you're in love.
Go figure.

37:48.375 --> 37:50.583
Like I believe it.
I've done this
a million times,

37:50.583 --> 37:52.250
and every time
it feels like new.

Here we are.

Hello, Robert.

Well, well, well.
If it isn't my old friend.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.959
I heard we lost last
Thursday, didn't we?

38:07.959 --> 38:10.333
Leave it to you
to greet me with that.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.000
Turnabout's
fair play, I think.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.583
I'm going to get you.

38:15.417 --> 38:16.875
I promise.

Good morning.
Don't make

38:24.875 --> 38:26.542
Are you two feuding?

38:26.542 --> 38:27.875
It isn't a feud.

38:27.875 --> 38:30.041
Feuding suggests
at one time you
liked each other.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.250
We never did.

38:32.041 --> 38:33.375
There should
be a mistrial here.

38:33.375 --> 38:34.667
This isn't a mistrial.

38:34.667 --> 38:37.208
This isn't a trial.
Then it's a "mis"

38:46.875 --> 38:48.708
Mr. Miller,
I'm sure your defender

38:48.708 --> 38:50.583
has explained all
of the basics to you,

38:50.583 --> 38:52.208
but let me just say,

38:52.208 --> 38:55.166
even though this feels
like a trial, it really isn't.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.959
It's just a process
that helps us decide.

38:57.959 --> 38:59.500
As imperfect
as it may be,

38:59.500 --> 39:01.417
we think it
works quite well.

39:01.417 --> 39:03.792
What you're going to see
in the screen Mr. Miller,

39:03.792 --> 39:05.542
will look and feel
so real to you,

39:05.542 --> 39:07.750
you might be a little
uneasy at first.

39:07.750 --> 39:09.083
But just relax.

39:09.083 --> 39:11.750
After a while,
I think it will become
pleasurable to you.

39:12.583 --> 39:15.291
They tell me it feels
something like 3-D.

39:20.166 --> 39:22.083
Any questions,
Mr. Miller?

39:26.792 --> 39:28.250
Miss Foster,
you may begin.

39:28.250 --> 39:29.708
Thank you,

39:32.250 --> 39:34.792
Over the course of
the following four days,

39:34.792 --> 39:37.417
I will attempt to show
that Daniel Miller,

39:37.417 --> 39:39.917
while he's a quality
human being,

39:39.917 --> 39:42.417
is still held back
by the fears

39:42.417 --> 39:46.667
that have plagued him
lifetime after lifetime.

39:47.333 --> 39:50.834
I believe that I can show,
without a shadow of a doubt,

39:50.834 --> 39:54.166
that he must once again
be returned to earth

39:54.166 --> 39:55.750

Mr. Miller,

40:04.083 --> 40:08.166
this signifies
you're 11 years, 4 months,
and 19 days old.

40:08.166 --> 40:09.625

No, I mean

did this bring up?

you were afraid?

the word "afraid"
all of a sudden?

42:35.834 --> 42:36.959
What word would you use?

42:36.959 --> 42:38.333
What word would I use?

42:38.333 --> 42:39.792
How about "restraint"?

42:40.333 --> 42:42.375
I think the little boy
was quite dignified.

42:42.375 --> 42:43.959
Restraint?

42:43.959 --> 42:45.166
Yes, ma'am.

42:45.166 --> 42:46.291
May I show you
what I mean?

42:47.000 --> 42:48.125
Be my guest.

42:49.166 --> 42:52.291
Your Honors, may we
go to 1-8-17, please?

42:55.166 --> 42:56.625
(BEEPING)

42:57.458 --> 42:59.125
What are you
accusing me of?
Nothing.

42:59.125 --> 43:00.291
What are you
accusing me of?
Nothing!

43:00.291 --> 43:01.625
Why don't you
say it to my face?

43:01.625 --> 43:02.708
What are you
talking about?

43:02.708 --> 43:04.166
Why don't you ever
think about my problems?

43:04.166 --> 43:06.000
Just lower your voice.
Lower my voice?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.041
You said you wouldn't
yell in front of the baby.

43:08.041 --> 43:09.542
Baby.
It's always the baby.
(BABBLES)

43:09.542 --> 43:10.625
What about me?

43:11.000 --> 43:12.834
I live here, too!
This is my house, too!

43:12.834 --> 43:15.166
I work very hard
to pay for this house!
I know you do.

43:15.166 --> 43:16.417
No, you don't.

43:16.417 --> 43:18.041
The minute I earn it,
you go out and spend it!

43:18.041 --> 43:20.000
What do you mean?
You think I spend
too much money?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.834
Yes!
All I do is scrimp!

43:21.834 --> 43:23.166
Look, if you
don't like it,

43:23.166 --> 43:24.667
why don't you get
on you high horse
and get out of here!

43:24.667 --> 43:26.041
George, stop it!
No!

43:26.041 --> 43:27.750
This happens
every time
you drink!

43:27.750 --> 43:29.000
Every time!
It's lecture time!

43:29.000 --> 43:30.083
It's lecture time!

43:30.083 --> 43:32.000
Why don't you just sit down
and join the lecture!

43:32.000 --> 43:33.166
Please...
Don't touch me.

43:33.166 --> 43:34.333
George!

43:35.542 --> 43:36.542
(CRYING)

43:46.166 --> 43:47.208
(BEEPS)

43:50.375 --> 43:53.000
DIAMOND:  In that one brief,
extraordinary moment

43:53.000 --> 43:55.208
when that baby and his
father's eyes linked,

43:55.208 --> 43:57.875
this child learned
the meaning of restraint.

43:59.083 --> 44:00.708
He wasn't afraid.

44:00.708 --> 44:02.208
He was mature.

44:02.208 --> 44:03.542
He was non-violent.

44:03.542 --> 44:05.041
Dignified, I call it.

44:05.041 --> 44:07.083
Now, my colleague
may believe
in hitting first

44:07.083 --> 44:08.708
and asking questions later.

44:08.708 --> 44:10.208
But, we're not
all that way.

44:10.208 --> 44:11.250
I resent that.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.708
Let's ask Mr. Miller.

44:14.708 --> 44:16.708
Mr. Miller,
in the schoolyard,

44:16.708 --> 44:18.667
did you want to
hit that child back?

44:20.250 --> 44:23.417
Well, I wanted
to hit him back,
but I felt restraint.

44:23.417 --> 44:25.500
You felt restraint.
I see.

44:26.583 --> 44:28.417
And do you think
that restraint

44:28.417 --> 44:30.792
is the best
course of action
every single time

44:30.792 --> 44:32.250
in every case?

44:32.250 --> 44:33.417
No.

44:33.417 --> 44:36.750
Wouldn't this have
been a case to
not restrain yourself?

44:37.875 --> 44:39.834
I believe, if you'd have
stuck up for yourself,

44:39.834 --> 44:41.583
this event would
not have haunted you

44:41.583 --> 44:44.083
throughout your
entire lifetime.

44:44.083 --> 44:45.875
You never got this
out of your mind.

44:46.375 --> 44:48.250
You always
thought about it,
didn't you?

44:48.250 --> 44:49.583
Hold on a second!

44:49.583 --> 44:51.250
People think about
lots of things

44:51.250 --> 44:53.041
throughout their
entire lifetime.

44:53.750 --> 44:55.417
You're going to isolate
this one incident?

44:55.417 --> 44:57.583
Aren't we here to
isolate incidents?

44:57.583 --> 44:59.750
Or maybe I don't
understand the job.

45:00.625 --> 45:03.333
Your Honors,
to save valuable time,

45:03.333 --> 45:05.750
I submit 11-4-19
as shown,

45:05.750 --> 45:07.250
without further comment.

45:08.125 --> 45:09.583
JUDGE:
Mr. Diamond?

45:09.583 --> 45:10.959
I'm fully satisfied.

45:10.959 --> 45:12.500
I love watching this kid.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.333
Mr. Miller, is there anything
you would like to say?

45:16.458 --> 45:19.125
I feel very good
about the restraint idea.

45:19.959 --> 45:21.166
Thank you,
Mr. Miller.

45:22.250 --> 45:23.750
JUDGE:  Mr. Diamond,
you're up.

45:25.125 --> 45:27.667
Your Honors, while
we're still in childhood,

45:27.667 --> 45:28.959
I'd like to show something

45:28.959 --> 45:31.834
which I feel is
absolutely extraordinary.

45:31.834 --> 45:33.917
Could we go to
10-9-15, please?

45:35.917 --> 45:37.625
(BEEPING)

45:44.208 --> 45:46.625
I'm on probation for
stealing those books.

45:46.625 --> 45:48.625
Now they're gonna
think I stole this.

45:48.625 --> 45:50.166
I'm gonna be expelled.

45:50.166 --> 45:51.750
You won't
be expelled.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.875
Of course I will.
I'm already
on probation.

45:53.875 --> 45:55.500
I'm in big trouble.

45:56.041 --> 45:57.041
(SHUSHING)

45:58.834 --> 46:00.333
Good afternoon, class.

46:00.333 --> 46:03.834
ALL: Good afternoon,
Mr. Wadworth.

46:03.834 --> 46:06.834
Continue working
on the assignment
you started last Tuesday.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.834
Here, take these.

46:10.375 --> 46:11.542
Really?

46:11.542 --> 46:12.875
I'll say I lost mine.

46:12.875 --> 46:14.250
But you'll
get in trouble.

46:14.250 --> 46:15.542
Just do it.

46:18.667 --> 46:20.708
Daniel, where
are your supplies?

46:20.708 --> 46:22.208
I left them at home.

46:22.208 --> 46:23.333
You left them?

46:23.333 --> 46:24.667
I lost them.

46:24.667 --> 46:27.041
What did you do?
Lose them or leave them?

46:27.041 --> 46:30.083
Well, both,
I left them
and I lost them.

46:30.083 --> 46:31.708
Where are your
supplies, Daniel?

46:31.708 --> 46:34.625
What's going on?
Do you know how
much these things cost?

46:34.625 --> 46:37.291
Class, tell Daniel
how much the paints cost.

46:37.291 --> 46:39.000
ALL: $10.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.417
And the brushes?

46:40.417 --> 46:42.208
ALL: $3.

46:42.208 --> 46:43.542
What's the total?

46:43.542 --> 46:45.708
ALL: $13.

46:46.542 --> 46:49.083
If you don't have
any paint, you can't
be an artist, Daniel.

46:49.083 --> 46:51.542
If just like you can't
be a swimmer unless
you get into the water.

46:51.542 --> 46:53.417
You've got to have paint,
you understand that?

46:53.417 --> 46:55.542
Yeah.
This is careless behavior.

46:55.542 --> 46:58.041
I'll have to
call your father
after school today.

46:58.875 --> 47:01.041
We're gonna have
to figure out a way
for you to pay for this.

47:02.208 --> 47:03.250
Yeah.

47:05.166 --> 47:06.375
(BEEPS)

47:10.583 --> 47:13.208
You got in quite
a bit of trouble for that,
didn't you, Dan?

47:13.208 --> 47:14.417
Yes.

47:14.417 --> 47:16.834
But you felt your friend
would have been
punished worse.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.041
Yes.

47:18.458 --> 47:19.792
Your Honors,
at 10 years old,

47:19.792 --> 47:23.208
he showed the
kind of courage that
most adults never find.

47:25.041 --> 47:27.250
I let the life
stand for itself here.

47:28.625 --> 47:32.250
Could we go to 10-9-15?
It's the evening
of that same day.

47:32.750 --> 47:33.750
Thanks.

47:35.917 --> 47:37.250
(BEEPING)

47:38.583 --> 47:40.458
How are you
gonna get the money
to pay for this?

47:40.458 --> 47:41.583
I don't know.

47:41.583 --> 47:44.375
I'm very, very
disappointed in you.

47:44.750 --> 47:45.917
I'm sorry.

47:45.917 --> 47:48.417
Now, we're gonna have
to punish you severely.

47:48.417 --> 47:49.583
You don't have
to punish me.

47:49.583 --> 47:50.917
Yes, we do.

47:50.917 --> 47:53.625
First of all,
no television
for a month!

47:53.625 --> 47:54.917
I didn't do it!

47:54.917 --> 47:55.917
Steve did it!

47:55.917 --> 47:57.083
It was Steve's fault.

47:57.083 --> 47:58.959
What are you
saying to me?

47:58.959 --> 48:00.333
Steve lost the paints.

48:00.333 --> 48:03.000
He probably stole them,
just like he stole the books.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.834
I didn't do it.
You've gotta believe me.

48:05.125 --> 48:06.291
Steve.

48:06.291 --> 48:07.333
Yeah.

48:07.333 --> 48:08.959
Hey, punish him.

48:08.959 --> 48:10.000
(BEEPS)

48:14.166 --> 48:16.458
What happened to
your friend Steve?

48:16.458 --> 48:18.291
Do you remember,
Mr. Miller?

48:18.708 --> 48:19.875
What do you mean?

48:19.875 --> 48:21.959
He was expelled from
school two days later.

48:21.959 --> 48:23.708
Isn't that what
happened to him?

48:23.708 --> 48:25.792
I thought he
left on his own.

48:25.792 --> 48:26.959
What's the point, please?

48:26.959 --> 48:28.500
I'm looking at the results

48:28.500 --> 48:30.792
of what you call
a courageous action.

48:31.375 --> 48:34.417
Mr. Miller might
have acted bravely
in the classroom,

48:34.417 --> 48:38.458
but we just watched him
crumble a few hours later,
and why?

48:38.458 --> 48:40.542
At the threat of
no television?

48:40.542 --> 48:42.708
I was 10-years-old.

48:42.708 --> 48:45.166
Television is everything
to a 10-year-old.

48:45.875 --> 48:47.000
It's like heroin.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.667
You can't just
pull it away.

48:49.083 --> 48:50.667
And I never wanted
to watch television.

48:50.667 --> 48:53.125
My parents made me
'cause they could go out.

48:53.125 --> 48:55.166
And I got hooked.

48:55.166 --> 48:57.375
You Honors,
Miss Foster and I
have had this argument

48:57.375 --> 48:58.875
for a long time.

48:59.333 --> 49:02.166
I think the act itself
is what's important.

49:02.166 --> 49:03.625
But she wants to
keep enlarging it

49:03.625 --> 49:05.834
until everything
loses its meaning.

49:06.375 --> 49:08.792
If I fixed a flat
tire on your car,

49:08.792 --> 49:11.166
and two years later
I lose your garden hose,

49:11.166 --> 49:13.375
according to you
I'm not going to get
any credit for the flat.

49:13.375 --> 49:15.458
I'm just the dumb
guy who lost the hose.

49:16.542 --> 49:18.125
And let me suggest this...

49:19.000 --> 49:20.417
Did we ever think

49:20.417 --> 49:23.250
that this young boy had
a bond with his father?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.250
I don't think
it had anything to
do with the friend.

49:26.250 --> 49:29.542
I just think Daniel
couldn't lie to his dad.

49:29.542 --> 49:30.583
That's all.

49:31.542 --> 49:32.959
You're nodding,
Mr. Miller.

49:32.959 --> 49:35.375
Does that mean you
agree with Mr. Diamond?

49:35.375 --> 49:36.708
Oh, yes.

49:36.708 --> 49:38.667
I had a bond
with my father.

49:38.667 --> 49:41.417
I pretty much
never lied to him.

49:41.417 --> 49:43.417
You never lied
to your father?

49:43.417 --> 49:46.542
Would you like me
to show you at least
500 examples?

49:47.750 --> 49:50.250
I said "pretty much"
never lied.

49:50.250 --> 49:52.250
I didn't say
I never ever lied.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.875
You have to lie sometimes...

49:54.708 --> 49:56.375
In an emergency.

49:57.208 --> 50:01.041
But it doesn't mean that
the bond is affected.

50:01.041 --> 50:03.208
If you've got the bond,
the bond's always there.

50:03.208 --> 50:04.458
And if you have
to lie occasionally,

50:04.458 --> 50:05.917
you not gonna interfere
with the bond.

50:06.583 --> 50:07.708
You know...

50:08.458 --> 50:10.542
The bond can wait
for a little lie.

50:10.542 --> 50:13.041
And in the end
it's there for you.

50:17.125 --> 50:19.834
You know, sometimes
in the middle of a lie,

50:19.834 --> 50:22.583
I found that the bond
would kick in,

50:23.208 --> 50:25.792
maybe squeeze
a little truth out.

50:25.792 --> 50:26.875
Psst.

50:27.458 --> 50:28.458
Wrap it up.

50:29.458 --> 50:30.792
I'm through.

50:32.083 --> 50:34.500
Very good day.
I'm very pleased.

50:34.500 --> 50:36.583
She's tough,
isn't she?

50:36.583 --> 50:38.250
If I told you
how tough,
my friend

50:38.250 --> 50:40.291
you wouldn't sleep,
believe me.

50:41.208 --> 50:43.792
Well, I'm off.
Call me if you need me.

50:44.458 --> 50:45.959
What are you doing
this evening?

50:45.959 --> 50:48.542
Going out with
that gal?
I can't. She's busy.

50:48.542 --> 50:50.333
Busy? Hah!

50:50.333 --> 50:51.917
Well,
I'll be damned.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.834
How are you?
All right.

51:26.625 --> 51:28.333
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

Hi.

51:38.041 --> 51:39.417
How are you?
(SPEAKS JAPANESE)

51:39.417 --> 51:40.667
Thank you.

51:41.875 --> 51:43.500
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

51:44.041 --> 51:45.500

51:49.333 --> 51:50.792
How are you tonight?
Fine.

51:51.542 --> 51:52.708
Thank you.

51:53.708 --> 51:55.333
What's good here?
Everything we have.

51:55.333 --> 51:56.375
Everything.

51:57.041 --> 51:59.166
What's this?
Looks like a worm.

51:59.500 --> 52:00.834
That's our
resident food.

52:01.542 --> 52:02.500
What does it
taste like?

52:02.834 --> 52:03.834
You'll, uh, throw up.

52:03.834 --> 52:05.333
Okay. Let me
have the tuna.

52:05.333 --> 52:07.834
Tuna, sure.
Okay. Tuna!

52:07.834 --> 52:09.208
Very good tuna!

52:09.208 --> 52:11.333
Oh, very fast.
Very fast.

52:11.333 --> 52:12.708
So I've been told.

52:13.917 --> 52:15.375
Mmm. Delicious.

52:15.375 --> 52:16.750
Do you like it?
Very good.

52:16.750 --> 52:18.792
Thank you very much.
Very good.

52:18.792 --> 52:20.375
So how many days
are you looking at?

52:21.041 --> 52:22.125
Hmm?

52:22.125 --> 52:24.041
How many days
you looking at?

52:25.208 --> 52:26.583
Nine.
Nine?

52:26.583 --> 52:28.708
Mmm-hmm.
Nine days?

52:28.708 --> 52:31.041
Oh, my God.
Nine days!

52:31.375 --> 52:33.166
ALL: Nine days!

52:33.166 --> 52:34.542
(ALL SHOUTING)

52:35.375 --> 52:36.708
You better have
more sake.

52:37.708 --> 52:39.417
You got nine days?
Yeah.

52:39.417 --> 52:40.875
I got 15.

52:41.542 --> 52:43.375
My name's Frank.
Daniel.

52:45.333 --> 52:47.000
15 days?
Mmm-hmm.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.834
Is that a lot?
I don't know.

52:50.750 --> 52:52.583
How'd you die, Dan?
May I call you Dan?

52:52.583 --> 52:55.041
Yeah.
I got hit by a bus.
Ooh.

52:56.291 --> 52:57.583
What about yourself?

52:57.583 --> 52:58.917
Got shot
in the head.

52:59.333 --> 53:00.750
Really? Murder?

53:00.750 --> 53:02.375
No.
Hunting accident.

53:02.792 --> 53:04.959
Some putz with bad eyesight
thought I was an animal.

53:04.959 --> 53:06.250
(LAUGHING)

53:08.250 --> 53:10.417
How did you make
your living, Dan?
Advertising.

53:10.417 --> 53:11.792
What about yourself?

53:11.792 --> 53:14.417
I made money
in adult books.
Selling them?

53:15.083 --> 53:17.750
No, reading them.
Yes, of course,
selling them.

53:17.750 --> 53:19.250
(CHUCKLING)

53:21.417 --> 53:22.917
Were you from L.A.?

53:24.083 --> 53:25.959
You know those nightclubs
up by the airport?

53:25.959 --> 53:27.250
Those strip clubs?

53:28.792 --> 53:31.083
I coined the phrase
"all nude."

53:31.834 --> 53:34.333
What do you mean?
That was mine.

53:34.333 --> 53:36.458
I bought two of the clubs
that were going under.

53:36.458 --> 53:38.667
They were only using
the word "nude."

53:38.667 --> 53:41.291
I put up
"totally all nude."

53:42.000 --> 53:43.125
Mmm-hmm.

53:43.458 --> 53:44.792
Doubled business
in a month.

53:44.792 --> 53:46.208
I gotta take a piss.
You want to go?

53:46.208 --> 53:47.291
No.

53:48.166 --> 53:49.792
CHEFS: (SHOUTING)
Thank you very much!

53:51.708 --> 53:54.125
I'm not leaving.
I'm just going to
take a piss.

53:54.125 --> 53:55.667
CHEFS: (SHOUTING)
Take a piss!

54:12.959 --> 54:14.667
(PHONE RINGING)

54:19.417 --> 54:20.959
Hello?
MAN:  Mr. Miller?

54:20.959 --> 54:22.041
Yes?

54:22.041 --> 54:23.667
I have a message
for you, sir.

54:24.375 --> 54:25.667
You do?
Yes.

54:25.667 --> 54:26.708
Here it comes.

54:27.875 --> 54:29.667
JULIA:  Hi! Where are you?

54:31.041 --> 54:32.333
Okay.

54:32.667 --> 54:33.708
I'm going to sleep.

54:33.708 --> 54:35.625
Listen, tomorrow
when you're through,

54:36.333 --> 54:38.208
meet me by
the front entrance,
the main entrance.

54:38.208 --> 54:39.542
I'll be there.

54:39.959 --> 54:42.667
I miss you.
Isn't that funny?
(CHUCKLES)

54:43.375 --> 54:44.959
Good night.

54:53.875 --> 54:55.250

54:55.250 --> 54:56.417
DIAMOND:  This is wild.

54:56.917 --> 54:58.375
Now, let me
get this straight.

54:58.375 --> 55:01.208
You actually had sex
with Benjamin Franklin?

55:01.708 --> 55:02.875
Twice.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

55:05.083 --> 55:06.333
How was he?

55:06.750 --> 55:08.208
He was fat, Bob.

55:08.208 --> 55:10.000
AUDIENCE:  Ooh!

55:10.000 --> 55:11.583
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

55:12.917 --> 55:14.583
I couldn't believe it
when they told me.

55:14.583 --> 55:16.333
(CHUCKLES)
It's wonderful.

55:16.333 --> 55:18.000
I forgot all about it.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.250
He was willing to
sleep underwater.

55:20.250 --> 55:22.417
(LAUGHS)
Marvelous.

55:23.208 --> 55:25.417
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.

55:25.417 --> 55:27.750
Morning.
I'm Dick Stanley.

55:28.208 --> 55:30.417
I'm going to
defend you today.
You're what?

55:30.417 --> 55:32.375
I'm going to
defend you today.

55:32.375 --> 55:33.834
Now, Mr. Diamond
couldn't make it.

55:33.834 --> 55:35.166
I'm filling in
for him.

55:35.166 --> 55:36.208
He couldn't make it?
(CHUCKLES)

55:36.208 --> 55:37.708
Come on,
you're playing
with me.

55:37.708 --> 55:39.375
Mr. Diamond will be
back tomorrow.

55:39.375 --> 55:41.458
How can you defend me?
You don't know
anything about me.

55:41.750 --> 55:44.792
Mr. Miller I use
51% of my brain.

55:44.792 --> 55:46.250
I know everything
about you.

55:46.250 --> 55:48.250
51%? That's clocked?

55:48.750 --> 55:50.417
Clocked.
Impressive.

55:50.750 --> 55:53.208
Oh, I would lose.
I can't start
all over with you.

55:53.208 --> 55:54.625
(STUTTERS)
I have lots--

55:54.625 --> 55:57.083
No, I operate
a little differently
from Mr. Diamond,

55:57.083 --> 55:59.250
but without tooting
my own horn,

55:59.250 --> 56:01.041
I'm quite good at this.

56:01.041 --> 56:02.875
I'm familiar with
every day of your life

56:02.875 --> 56:04.583
and I want you
to have confidence.

56:04.583 --> 56:05.583
I'm going to lose.

56:07.208 --> 56:08.917
Good morning.
Good morning.

56:08.917 --> 56:10.041
JUDGE:  Good morning,
everybody.

56:10.458 --> 56:12.208
Thank you so much.

56:12.583 --> 56:13.792
That was so nice.

56:13.792 --> 56:15.125
Oh, it was nothing.

56:16.375 --> 56:17.417
JUDGE:  Good morning,
Mr. Miller.

56:17.417 --> 56:18.417
Good morning.

56:19.125 --> 56:21.333
Your Honor,
my defender is not here
this morning.

56:21.333 --> 56:23.000
And I feel that
under the circumstances,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.917
this puts me
at a disadvantage.

56:26.417 --> 56:28.667
It's quite common.
Mr. Stanley will do fine.

56:28.667 --> 56:29.750
Let's begin.

56:31.792 --> 56:33.625
(SIGHS)
Your Honors,

56:34.583 --> 56:36.959
today I would like to
begin with an episode

56:36.959 --> 56:38.959
in the 24th year
of life.

56:40.208 --> 56:42.291
Mr. Miller had been,
uh, out of school

56:42.291 --> 56:45.125
and working
for several years.

56:45.125 --> 56:49.750
And he had put aside $10,000
specifically to invest.

56:50.583 --> 56:52.125
Do you remember,
Mr. Miller?

56:52.834 --> 56:55.500
One of Mr. Miller's
good friends from school

56:55.500 --> 56:59.625
was the son of an executive
of the Casio corporation,

56:59.625 --> 57:01.542
which at that time
was a very small company

57:01.542 --> 57:03.333
and not doing
particularly well.

57:03.750 --> 57:06.792
Mr. Miller had a dinner
with his friend,
Your Honors

57:06.792 --> 57:09.333
at which he was
given information

57:10.208 --> 57:13.333
which comes along
maybe once every
five, six lifetimes.

57:14.417 --> 57:16.708
May we go to
24-2-16, please?

57:17.041 --> 57:18.708
(WHIRRING)

57:18.708 --> 57:20.333
(BEEPING)

57:21.250 --> 57:22.667
They're gearing up now.

57:22.667 --> 57:24.625
They should start production
in about three months.

57:25.041 --> 57:26.542
Buy as much stock
as you can.

57:26.542 --> 57:28.333
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

57:28.333 --> 57:31.667
Switzerland keeps
the time, Charles,

57:31.667 --> 57:32.708
not Japan.

57:32.708 --> 57:34.333
That's gonna change.
I don't think so.

57:34.333 --> 57:35.792
Wait, why can't Japan
keep the time?

57:35.792 --> 57:38.792
'Cause you need a society
that's into precision
to keep time.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.875
And with all due respect,
Japan makes a hell of a radio,

57:41.875 --> 57:43.834
but they don't know beans
about precision.

57:44.083 --> 57:46.708
Now, you come here,

57:46.708 --> 57:50.041
and you tell me
the Germans are going to
start making watches,

57:50.041 --> 57:51.250
you've got my money.

57:51.250 --> 57:53.542
(CHUCKLES)
What's the stock

57:53.917 --> 57:55.583
Six.
Okay, here's

57:56.375 --> 57:57.542
When word
hits the street,

57:58.125 --> 57:59.417
you're at three.

57:59.417 --> 58:01.083
(CHUCKLES)
You watch.

58:01.083 --> 58:02.375
Remember who said it.

58:03.417 --> 58:04.542
(LAUGHING)

58:05.875 --> 58:07.500
(BEEP)
(WHIRRING)

58:08.875 --> 58:11.583
LENA:  Your Honors,
for the record,
the Casio corporation

58:11.583 --> 58:15.166
is one of the largest
manufacturers of timepieces
in the universe.

58:16.542 --> 58:17.750
I know
who they are.

58:18.875 --> 58:20.250
And for the record,
Your Honors,

58:20.250 --> 58:23.083
his original investment
of $10,000

58:23.083 --> 58:26.458
would be worth
37.2 million today.

58:26.875 --> 58:27.917
Wow!

58:29.583 --> 58:32.417
Mmm-hmm. I have nothing
further to say at this time.

58:33.291 --> 58:35.250
Mr. Stanley.
I'm fine.

58:36.208 --> 58:38.583
You're what?
He's not going to

58:39.792 --> 58:41.250
You're not gonna
say anything at all now?

58:41.625 --> 58:42.917
You speak.

58:42.917 --> 58:44.083
I'd like to hear
what you have to say.

58:44.417 --> 58:45.750
Jeez, you are good.

58:46.917 --> 58:50.250
Listen, (STUTTERS) I'm not
as smart as everyone here,

58:50.250 --> 58:53.125
but does this
make me defective

58:53.125 --> 58:55.417
because I didn't
make money on this?

58:55.417 --> 58:58.125
I can't believe that
the whole point
of the universe is...

58:58.125 --> 59:01.291
Is to make money.
(STUTTERS)
I just can't believe that.

59:01.291 --> 59:03.625
LENA:  This has nothing to do
with making money.

59:04.125 --> 59:06.500
We're looking at
a judgment you made.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.500
And nobody dragged you
from your home and said,

59:08.500 --> 59:10.542
"You have to
invest $10,000."

59:10.542 --> 59:11.959
You chose to do that.

59:11.959 --> 59:13.291
You sought
the investment.

59:13.291 --> 59:14.959
We're just looking
at that choice.

59:16.333 --> 59:17.959
What did you
finally invest in,
Mr. Miller?

59:17.959 --> 59:18.959
Do you remember?

59:21.041 --> 59:22.959
(SOFTLY) I think
it was cattle.

59:23.333 --> 59:24.750
Hmm?
(NORMAL) Cattle.

59:26.458 --> 59:27.667
What happened
to the cattle?

59:29.458 --> 59:30.792
I never got
a straight answer.

59:31.667 --> 59:33.500
All I know is,
their teeth fell out.

59:38.083 --> 59:39.166
I rest.

59:39.583 --> 59:40.959
Mr. Stanley,
you're up.

59:41.542 --> 59:43.125
No counter
at this time,
Your Honor.

59:43.500 --> 59:44.792
Wait a second.

59:45.458 --> 59:47.500
You're not going to
show something in my favor?

59:47.500 --> 59:48.917
Not at this juncture. No.

59:48.917 --> 59:50.542
I think we'd do better
to move on.

59:50.542 --> 59:52.875
(SCOFFS)
LENA:  Shall we move on,

59:52.875 --> 59:54.208
Sure, let's move on.

59:55.166 --> 59:58.166
Your Honors,
I would like to
go to 29-4-5.

59:58.834 --> 01:00:02.166
This is the evening
before Mr. Miller took
the job in advertising

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:04.166
he was to hold
until his passing.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.083
He asked his wife
to help him
by playing a little game.

01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:09.333
Do you remember,
Mr. Miller.

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:11.041
You asked her
to act the boss

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.500
so you could
sharpen your tools

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.291
in order to get
what he wanted.

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:15.333
(WHIRRING)

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:16.667
(BEEPING)

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:19.583
Do this for me.
It helps.

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.667
Not now.
I'm eating.
Come on, do it!

01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:24.041
What do you
want me to do?
Be him.

01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:27.166
This is silly.
It's not silly.

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:29.583
Offer me $55,000,
no more.

01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:31.500
How much
do you want?

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.125
How much are you
offering me?

01:00:33.125 --> 01:00:34.750
$55,000.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.500
I can't work here
for a penny under 65.
I'm sorry.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.375
Well, I can't pay you 65.

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:40.542
Then I can't work here.

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:43.333
$58,000.
65.

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:45.375

65.

61.

01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:51.166
Let me make it plain.

01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:54.375
I cannot take the job
for under 65,

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:55.708
under no conditions.

01:00:57.375 --> 01:00:58.792

I would like to
go directly

01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:01.500
to the next afternoon
and show you
the real encounter.

01:01:03.667 --> 01:01:06.208
Daniel, I'm prepared
to offer $49,000.

01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:07.417
I'll take it.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.583

a parking place.
Okay.

Why did you
cave in so fast?
I'm just curious.

01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:31.083
Why did you accept
so much less money
than you wanted?

01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:32.083
And do it so quickly.

01:01:32.542 --> 01:01:33.917
Here we go again
with money.

01:01:33.917 --> 01:01:36.083
Obviously, this is
all about money.

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:39.834
Look, I'm guilty.
I didn't make enough money.
Okay?

01:01:39.834 --> 01:01:42.375
Call me a hippie.
Send me to hell.
I give up.

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:44.583
You keep thinking
it's about money.

01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:45.875
But it's about fear.

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:49.250
Why didn't you
stand up to your boss

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:50.375
the way you did
to your wife?

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:51.708
What happened
in your mind?

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.458
Well, first of all,
it wasn't my wife.

01:01:53.959 --> 01:01:56.959
It was a man with a suit.
And the suit had a odor.

01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:59.583
And the odor
said $49,000.

01:01:59.959 --> 01:02:01.959
I like that very much.

01:02:03.542 --> 01:02:05.959
So your nostrils
told you you were
worth less?

01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:07.667
Is that what
you're saying?

01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:09.291
The process that
a person goes through

01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:12.417
when they're accepting
a salary is a complicated one.

01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:14.792
You don't know
all my reasons.

01:02:14.792 --> 01:02:16.417
Anyway, we lived fine
on that money.

01:02:16.417 --> 01:02:17.750
That money was fine.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.125
If you wanna make it
about money,
you may do so

01:02:20.125 --> 01:02:21.834
but we're looking
at fear.

01:02:21.834 --> 01:02:23.000
What was I afraid of?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.083
You tell me.

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:26.125
49 grand is
a lot of money!

01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:31.625
I have nothing more
to say at this time.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.667
Mr. Stanley.
I'm fine.

01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:37.000
I can't believe it.

toot your own horn.

to show something,
Mr. Miller?

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:43.708
I got a raise
six months later.

01:02:44.125 --> 01:02:45.708
Well, if you'd like
to show that,
let us know.

I'd like to present

you had Dick Stanley

they're taking that
part very seriously.

01:10:30.542 --> 01:10:32.458
The Romanians
are excellent at it.

01:10:32.458 --> 01:10:35.083
If you make fun of me,
I'm gonna get you.

01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:36.625
You've already got me.

01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:44.458
JULIA: What time
do you start?

01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:45.708
DANIEL: Early
in the morning.

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.625
I don't have to
start till 3:00,

01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:49.667
so you want to have
dinner tomorrow night?

01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:52.500
Actually, I thought
I'd start dating others now.

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:56.000
I have my eye on
this 91-year-old.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.333
(CHUCKLING)

01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.333
Well, I'll be at the
main entrance at 5:00.

01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:02.542
I'll be there.

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:05.500
If you get there early,
just come to my
screening room.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.000
You can take a look
at some of my life.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.125
I'd like that.

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:11.834
Okay.

01:11:12.166 --> 01:11:13.166
So...

01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:15.333
Good night.

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:16.375
Good night.

01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:41.333
So, good night.

01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:42.875
Yeah, good night.

01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:44.708
Good night.

01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:47.708
You'll sleep great.

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:50.208
I have three boxes of
candy waiting for me.

01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:55.166
Oh, did they give you
those chocolate swans?

01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:57.875
Swans?

01:11:58.208 --> 01:12:01.542
They're cream-filled.
They're really delicious.

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.375
Swans.

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:05.750
No.

01:12:06.417 --> 01:12:08.708
I think I'm just
getting breath mints.

01:12:08.917 --> 01:12:09.875
Oh...

01:12:12.542 --> 01:12:13.542
Okay.

01:12:14.917 --> 01:12:16.041
Good night.

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.208
Sleep well.
Same to you.

01:12:35.792 --> 01:12:36.750
Howard.

01:12:48.583 --> 01:12:50.750
Oh, good morning.
Morning.

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:52.166
After you.

01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:53.250
Thank you.

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.166
Now I have no attorney.

01:13:00.166 --> 01:13:01.250
Hmm.

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:06.625
Gee, that's a very,
very nice outfit.

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:09.750
Thank you.

01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:13.917
Do you like it here?

01:13:14.583 --> 01:13:17.125
(SIGHS) Mr. Miller,
I'll make you a promise.

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:19.959
When we're all through,
if you still want to
know about me,

01:13:19.959 --> 01:13:21.375
I'll be more than
happy to tell you.

01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:24.959
But right now,
let's concentrate
on you, all right?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.166
Good morning!

01:13:27.834 --> 01:13:29.750
Well, well.
Look who's here.

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:31.750
Good morning.
I missed you.

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:32.959
How are you, buddy?

01:13:32.959 --> 01:13:34.000
What do you care?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.333
Oh, stop it.

01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:37.417
You think I let
you down, don't you?

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:40.083
Where were you?
I'm just curious.

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.834
I'd tell you,
but you wouldn't understand.

01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:44.291
Don't treat me
like a moron. Try me.

01:13:45.458 --> 01:13:47.834
I was trapped
near the inner
circle of thought.

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:50.667
I don't understand.
I told you.

01:13:51.834 --> 01:13:53.041
Good morning.

01:13:53.041 --> 01:13:54.542
Morning.
Morning.

01:13:55.875 --> 01:13:57.708
Hi. How are you?

01:13:57.708 --> 01:13:59.166
Good morning, everybody.

01:13:59.834 --> 01:14:01.959
Let's begin.
Miss Foster, you're up.

01:14:02.834 --> 01:14:04.333
Thank you, Your Honors.

01:14:05.333 --> 01:14:07.417
This morning,

01:14:07.417 --> 01:14:10.291
l would like to begin
in the 34th year of life.

01:14:11.542 --> 01:14:13.667
Mr. Miller had accepted
a speaking engagement

01:14:13.667 --> 01:14:17.375
to represent
all of the West Coast
advertising agencies

01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:20.500
in a very important speech
to the Ford Motor Company.

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:23.917
A situation where
if he did well,

01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:26.208
it could have worked
wonders for his career.

01:14:26.542 --> 01:14:28.500
Let's not make this
the end of the world, okay?

01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:31.834
May we go to
34-7-7, please?

01:14:32.834 --> 01:14:33.834
(BEEPING)

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.542
It's packed
like sardines.
Are you ready?

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.041
What? I can't do it.
There's too many people.

01:14:43.041 --> 01:14:46.000
I just looked.
There's too many people.
I can't go out there.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.750
You've got to.
I can't go out there.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:49.083
Something has
happened to me.

01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:51.208
This is way,
way too many people.

01:14:51.208 --> 01:14:52.583
I'm having horrible
stage fright.

01:14:52.583 --> 01:14:53.875
I can't go out there.

01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:55.041
Hey, you got to
go out there.

01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:56.708
A lot of people
are counting on you.
Come on.

01:14:56.708 --> 01:14:58.333
I can't do it.
I'm gonna make
a fool of myself.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:14:59.417
No, you're not.

01:14:59.417 --> 01:15:01.375
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

01:15:01.375 --> 01:15:03.708
Yes, you can.
My heart is racing.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.959
I am having some sort
of an anxiety attack.

01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:07.208
Come on.
You know this stuff.

01:15:07.208 --> 01:15:08.417
You look great.
Let's go.

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:09.583
Peter, I can't
think straight.

01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:12.125
Now listen to me,
that's too many people.

01:15:12.125 --> 01:15:13.250
I don't want
to go out there.

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:14.708
You  have
to
cancel this.

01:15:14.959 --> 01:15:16.000
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.583
Let's go quickly,
you're on.

01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:19.250
Um, he's having
a little bit of trouble.

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:20.959
Just give us
a second, all right?

01:15:20.959 --> 01:15:22.750
Let's go. You've got
a full house. It's packed.

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:23.917
Let's go!

01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:26.500
Please don't make me
do this.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.959
You'll be fine.

01:15:27.959 --> 01:15:29.959
ANNOUNCER:  Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:31.917
Would you please
welcome our speaker
for today?

01:15:31.917 --> 01:15:34.708
From Foote, Cone & Belding,
Mr. Daniel Miller.

01:15:34.708 --> 01:15:36.083
(APPLAUSE)

01:15:36.083 --> 01:15:37.875
I'll be right here
if you need me.

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:06.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your
attention, please?

01:16:06.792 --> 01:16:10.000
Nothing serious, but we have
a gas leak under this room.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'd like you all to file out,

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.000
very orderly.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.291
This is only
for precaution.

01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:19.500
(CROWD MURMURING)

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:28.834
(BEEP)

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.333
Your Honors,

01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:33.375
I would have shown this day

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:36.166
to illustrate just
how brave Mr. Miller is.

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:40.125
With all the paying
and panic and confusion
going on in his mind,

01:16:40.125 --> 01:16:42.458
he still walked out
to that microphone.

01:16:42.458 --> 01:16:44.375
He never said anything!

01:16:44.375 --> 01:16:46.291
There was a gas leak!

01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:49.166
Yes, but he never went back
and accomplished it.

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:52.834
He never got up in front
of a large group
of people again.

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.708
Ha! Maybe he
didn't want to.

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:57.208
Mr. Miller accepted
that speaking engagement

01:16:57.208 --> 01:16:59.041
with a great deal
of excitement.

01:16:59.041 --> 01:17:01.125
He wanted to be there.

01:17:01.708 --> 01:17:04.208
If he had accomplished
that moment,

01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:06.500
I believe that the rest
of his life would have gone

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.875
in a much
better direction.
I'm positive of it.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:12.166
LAWYER:  You're positive of it?
This woman is wonderful!

01:17:12.166 --> 01:17:13.917
The rest of his life
would have gone

01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:15.667
in a much better
direction?

01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:17.375
Just incredible.

01:17:18.208 --> 01:17:19.417
(SIGHS)

01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:22.750
Your Honors, I'd like
to get off this scene

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:25.667
and move on to something
that I think we'll have
a ball watching.

01:17:25.667 --> 01:17:28.417
This is damn
exciting stuff.

01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:31.250
Daniel, where did
this scene take place?

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.333
I don't know what
you're going to show.

01:17:33.333 --> 01:17:36.834
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're going on 31-1-9.

Big bear.

01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:43.166
Big bear.

01:17:44.583 --> 01:17:46.583
Watch this, Your Honors.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:48.417

How far did you have
to go for help?

01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:41.166
About three miles.

01:18:41.166 --> 01:18:42.917
You broke that leg
in two places?

With no help,
by himself,

01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:01.125
with his badly broken leg,
as I've ever seen,

01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:04.208
this man crawled
three miles to get help.

01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:06.291
You can't be serious.
I'm sorry?

01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:09.917
What did we just watch?
That is self-preservation.

01:19:09.917 --> 01:19:11.375
He didn't risk
his life.

01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:13.000
He saved his life.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.333
Oh, I see, you're not a hero
if you save your own life?

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:18.708
A hero?
No, you're not. No.

01:19:18.708 --> 01:19:21.041
No one here
is accusing Mr. Miller

01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:23.166
of not having
a survival instinct.

01:19:23.166 --> 01:19:27.375
We're here to see
if he can overcome
fear, not pain.

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:29.500
You don't see the fear
in this situation?

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.750
What was he afraid of?

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:32.834
Well, how about death,
for starters?

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:34.542
I hope you realize,
Miss Foster,

01:19:34.542 --> 01:19:36.000
it would be very hard

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.834
to be a brilliant
public speaker

01:19:37.834 --> 01:19:39.667
if you're lying dead
in the snow.

01:19:39.667 --> 01:19:41.667
Mr. Miller, for the record,

01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:44.166
you never rode
a snowmobile again,
did you?

01:19:44.166 --> 01:19:46.959
Wait a second.
Not because I was afraid,

01:19:46.959 --> 01:19:48.667
because I hated it!

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.208
You have to
believe me on this.

01:19:51.208 --> 01:19:53.834
This has nothing to do
with fear. This is hate.

01:19:53.834 --> 01:19:56.667
This is a rotten contraption,
Your Honors.

01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:59.083
First of all, it heats up
like a toaster oven.

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:02.583
from my knee
to my crotch.

01:20:02.583 --> 01:20:04.250
Singed it right off.

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.041
Secondly, I don't know
if it was the leather-seat,

01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:08.542
or if it was lined with fur.

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:12.458
But years of
rotting and drying out
and getting wet...

01:20:12.458 --> 01:20:14.667
Mine smelled like
an old sheepdog.

01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:17.750
Thirdly, it's very,
very noisy.

01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:19.250
They don't tell you
about that.

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:21.417
You don't find out
until about the second hour,

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:23.041
when you can't
hear anyone.

01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:24.542
You get off
and have a snack,

01:20:24.542 --> 01:20:26.875
and your friends
are in a silent movie.

01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:28.875
And fourth, uh...

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:31.917
Pardon the expression,
but your balls vibrate

01:20:31.917 --> 01:20:34.208
for three weeks afterwards.

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:41.125
I'm very proud
of you.

01:20:41.125 --> 01:20:44.083
Very, very good day.
Very emotional day.

01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:46.750
What are you
gonna do tonight?

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:48.125
I'm gonna see
this woman.

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:49.250
Julia?

01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:50.583
How did you
know her name?

01:20:50.583 --> 01:20:52.417
Still don't get
the big brain bit, do you?

01:20:52.417 --> 01:20:54.458
I'll see you tomorrow.
Feel good,

01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:57.208
you did very well.
See you.

Going back for the cat
is wonderful.

01:21:48.834 --> 01:21:50.667
What kind of cat
was it, Julia?

01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:51.959
Persian.

01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:53.917
Oh. I love Persian.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:05.417
I'm sorry for the delay.
I just had to see that again.

01:22:05.417 --> 01:22:07.792
Oh, that's all right.
It's spectacular.

01:22:11.542 --> 01:22:12.750
I think that's
all for today.

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:14.417
We'll meet
one more time tomorrow,

enjoyment's sake.

around 1 o'clock.

Hi!

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:25.834
Great job.

01:22:25.834 --> 01:22:27.208
Great.

you again. How are you?

Good. You have
a good time tonight.
Thanks.

I will see you
tomorrow at 1:00?
Okay.

Bye-bye.

Listen, Sam told me
about this amazing
Italian restaurant.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.166
What do you say?

01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:41.125
Very exciting stuff
up there, really.

01:22:41.667 --> 01:22:43.708
It was like watching
a Mutual of Omaha commercial.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.542
You're just jealous.

are gigantic.

Mmm. I'm so hungry.

love this place.
This is supposed to be

01:23:05.041 --> 01:23:06.417

in the area.

Mmm-hmm.

So what was your
favorite food
in the whole world.

Turkey with stuffing. Yeah.

01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:20.208
Really? I couldn't
eat turkey.
Why not?

01:23:20.208 --> 01:23:23.000
Well, when I was a kid
I had one as a pet,
and I named it.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.083
(CHUCKLES)

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.708
And you can't eat
something you've named.

01:23:25.708 --> 01:23:27.583
I wish someone had
told me that years ago.

01:23:27.583 --> 01:23:29.291
I would have named
ice cream.

I like fish.

01:23:35.417 --> 01:23:37.041
Yeah, me, too.
What kind?

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.750
Well, salmon,
and I like the kind

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:42.583

nuclear reactors,
in the rocks.

so fresh,

onto the plate themselves.

in cholesterol?

even be a Jacuzzi.

bring me anything.

What?
What did I say?
Nice to meet you both.

So you don't forget,
I bring these to you.

01:28:13.166 --> 01:28:15.166
Now you got
nine pies in here.

01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:16.834
You think that's
gonna be enough
or you want more?

01:28:17.208 --> 01:28:18.208
I didn't want these.

01:28:18.375 --> 01:28:19.917
Hey, you told me
to make these pies.

01:28:20.208 --> 01:28:21.542
No, sir. I did not.

01:28:22.041 --> 01:28:23.708
You said that.
No.

01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:24.875
Yes, you did.

01:28:24.875 --> 01:28:26.875
I have no place
to put these boxes.

01:28:26.875 --> 01:28:28.750
Please, you're
embarrassing me!

01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:29.750
You shy.

01:28:30.917 --> 01:28:33.208
I'm going to bring you
some steaks.

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:34.500
No steaks!
No steaks!

01:28:36.375 --> 01:28:37.542
(MOANS)

01:29:05.792 --> 01:29:07.000
What's going to
happen to you?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.250
Did Sam tell you
anything?

01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:11.083
He said I wouldn't
come back to the hotel
after tomorrow.

01:29:12.417 --> 01:29:13.917
That's all I know.

01:29:16.458 --> 01:29:18.083
I have to
tell you something.

01:29:20.291 --> 01:29:22.083
I know you think
I've got it all together.

01:29:22.083 --> 01:29:23.375
You do!

01:29:23.375 --> 01:29:25.250
Not quite.

01:29:26.667 --> 01:29:28.542
One of the things
I do know how to do
really well

01:29:28.542 --> 01:29:30.125
is make things work,
you know.

01:29:30.125 --> 01:29:32.750
I can take a situation
and just make it okay.

01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:34.542
I've always been
able to do that.

01:29:35.583 --> 01:29:36.708
But it's work.

01:29:38.291 --> 01:29:39.583
And this...

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:42.125
This isn't.

01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:43.792
I don't know
what this is,

01:29:45.458 --> 01:29:46.792
but it's...

01:29:48.333 --> 01:29:49.625
Well, it's...

01:29:50.291 --> 01:29:51.750
Effortless. (CHUCKLES)
Effortless.

01:29:52.667 --> 01:29:54.750
I know. I know.

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:58.083
And I've never, ever,
ever had that before.

01:29:58.333 --> 01:29:59.500
Tell me about it!

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.625
I didn't think it
was ever going to
happen to me.

01:30:01.625 --> 01:30:03.000
So, great...

01:30:03.458 --> 01:30:05.083
Where do we find it?
In the pit stop.

01:30:05.083 --> 01:30:07.125
Yeah.
Thanks, God.

01:30:07.458 --> 01:30:10.834
Well, better this
than nothing, I guess.

01:30:10.834 --> 01:30:11.917
I guess.

01:30:14.917 --> 01:30:16.458
Want to spend
the night with me?

01:30:18.208 --> 01:30:19.959
More than
anything else
in the world.

01:30:20.458 --> 01:30:23.667
Oh, good.
Come on.
Let's go.

01:30:23.667 --> 01:30:24.834
Wait.

01:30:25.667 --> 01:30:27.125
I don't think I can.

01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:28.375
I don't think
I should.

01:30:29.667 --> 01:30:31.041
Why?

01:30:31.834 --> 01:30:32.875
Because...

01:30:34.166 --> 01:30:35.667
This is
already better

01:30:35.667 --> 01:30:38.000
than any sex
I've ever had...

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.458
Ever.

01:30:39.458 --> 01:30:42.750
And, I don't want to
screw it up...

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:43.917
Literally.

01:30:43.917 --> 01:30:45.542
How do you know
what's going to happen?

01:30:45.542 --> 01:30:47.125
I don't. I don't.

01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:48.792
Let's say
it's the most
amazing thing

01:30:48.792 --> 01:30:50.166
that ever was.

01:30:50.166 --> 01:30:51.166
Then what am I
gonna do?

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:53.625
By the looks
of things,

01:30:53.625 --> 01:30:55.041
we're not going
to the same place,

01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:57.834
so I'll just have to
miss it forever
and ever and ever?

01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:00.959
What if
it's not so good?

01:31:01.834 --> 01:31:03.834
Then I won't be able
to fantasize about it.

01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:09.375
I love you.

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:11.542
Oh, Julia.

01:31:19.542 --> 01:31:20.750
Oh...

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:24.458
If I had a fire scene
like you had today,

01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:26.250
I would
feel differently.
I'm sure.

01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:28.542
I'd stay here.
I'd never leave.

01:31:29.583 --> 01:31:33.041
But I've been defending
myself so hard these
last few days,

01:31:33.041 --> 01:31:35.166
and I just don't want to
be judged anymore.

01:31:36.208 --> 01:31:38.208
I have this
wonderful feeling
inside of me,

01:31:38.208 --> 01:31:39.542
but I'm af--

01:31:40.166 --> 01:31:43.000
I'm just tired
of being judged.

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:46.458
It's okay.

01:31:48.291 --> 01:31:49.583
I'm going to
miss you.

01:31:49.917 --> 01:31:51.083
I'm going to
miss you so much.

01:31:51.083 --> 01:31:52.250
I love you, Daniel.

01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:53.291
Oh, Julia.

01:31:53.291 --> 01:31:54.375
I'll miss you.

01:31:54.708 --> 01:31:56.083
Oh, Julia.

01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:02.959
Oh...

01:32:03.959 --> 01:32:05.917
Okay. I should go.

01:32:06.458 --> 01:32:07.542
Okay.

01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:18.041
Okay.

01:33:05.208 --> 01:33:06.291
WOMAN:  Yes, Mr. Miller?

01:33:06.291 --> 01:33:08.792
Can you get me
the Majestic Hotel,
please?

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:10.458
Hold on, sir.

01:33:13.583 --> 01:33:14.667
MAN:  Majestic Hotel.

01:33:14.667 --> 01:33:16.041
Yes. Julia...

01:33:18.041 --> 01:33:20.333
My God.
I don't know
her last name.

01:33:21.166 --> 01:33:22.583
Excuse me, sir?

01:33:22.583 --> 01:33:24.708
I've fallen in love with
a woman in your hotel,

01:33:24.708 --> 01:33:26.333
and I don't know
her last name.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.250
Let's see. What's
her first name?

01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:30.500
Julia.

01:33:30.834 --> 01:33:32.333
We have
two Julias.

01:33:32.333 --> 01:33:34.166
Both have
do not disturbs on.

01:33:34.333 --> 01:33:36.834
Can you ring
through, please?
It's very important.

01:33:37.417 --> 01:33:39.208
No, sir. I'm not allowed
to do that.

01:33:39.208 --> 01:33:40.667
But it's
very important.

01:33:41.542 --> 01:33:42.959
I'm sorry, sir.

01:33:44.166 --> 01:33:46.333
Can I leave
a message, then?

01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:47.875
I guess
for both of them.

01:33:48.333 --> 01:33:49.667
Go ahead, sir.

01:33:51.083 --> 01:33:56.041
Tell them both
that I love them
more than life itself

01:33:57.125 --> 01:33:59.583
and I've never met
anybody like them

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.166
and I'll miss them
forever and ever.

01:34:03.166 --> 01:34:05.083
Is that all,
sir?

01:34:06.375 --> 01:34:07.667
Yeah. That's all.

01:34:07.667 --> 01:34:09.041
Thank you.

01:34:09.041 --> 01:34:10.542
(PHONE CLICKS)

01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:16.834
DIAMOND:  Has Mr. Miller
overcome his fears,
Your Honors?

01:34:17.917 --> 01:34:20.333
I believe that
my final summation scene

01:34:20.333 --> 01:34:24.041
will prove to you
that he has.

01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:29.708
Mr. Miller,
your middle 30s

01:34:29.708 --> 01:34:32.208
were not particularly
good for you, were they?

01:34:32.708 --> 01:34:34.125
No.

01:34:34.792 --> 01:34:38.291
A bad divorce left you
with virtually nothing
financially.

01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:41.625
You had about $9,000
to your name, correct?

01:34:41.625 --> 01:34:43.083
Yes, sir.

01:34:43.417 --> 01:34:45.125
Months before
your divorce,

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:48.583
you and your wife
had purchased tickets
to Hong Kong.

01:34:50.166 --> 01:34:51.875
You were going
to go together,

01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:56.542
but after the separation,
she cashed hers in.

01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:59.041
What did you do
with yours?

01:35:00.583 --> 01:35:01.708
I used it.

01:35:02.458 --> 01:35:04.250
He used it.

01:35:06.041 --> 01:35:08.375
With only $9,000
to his name,

01:35:08.625 --> 01:35:10.166
with his life in a rut,

01:35:10.166 --> 01:35:11.959
Mr. Miller didn't do
the safe thing.

01:35:12.458 --> 01:35:13.917
He could've
cashed in that ticket.

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:18.333
But Mr. Miller said,
"The hell with it.
I'm going to Hong Kong."

01:35:20.083 --> 01:35:22.959
Now that alone
in my books
takes a lot of guts,

01:35:23.667 --> 01:35:26.291
but, Your Honors,
it just begins there.

01:35:26.291 --> 01:35:29.333
Let us go to 36-9-16.

01:35:30.125 --> 01:35:32.959
This is Los Angeles
International Airport.

01:35:33.625 --> 01:35:34.959
You're
in seat 41B.

01:35:36.792 --> 01:35:38.125
B?
Mmm-hmm.

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:40.959
Between A and C?

01:35:40.959 --> 01:35:42.250
Yes, it is.

01:35:43.667 --> 01:35:46.250
I'm sitting between people
all the way to Asia?

01:35:46.792 --> 01:35:48.041
Yes, you are.

01:35:48.041 --> 01:35:51.458
Is coach
completely full?

01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:53.625
Oh, yes.

01:35:57.959 --> 01:35:59.875
Is there any space left
in first class?

01:36:02.708 --> 01:36:04.166
We have
one seat left.

01:36:05.208 --> 01:36:06.500
What is
the price difference?

01:36:06.708 --> 01:36:07.959
Round trip?

01:36:09.834 --> 01:36:13.834
It's an additional
$3,194.

01:36:19.375 --> 01:36:21.000
I'll take it.

01:36:24.708 --> 01:36:29.041
Your Honors, this man
just spent 1/3
of his life savings

01:36:29.041 --> 01:36:30.708
to be a little
more comfortable.

01:36:31.667 --> 01:36:32.959
What does that
say to you?

01:36:34.375 --> 01:36:37.166
As stressed out as he was,
as crazy as his life was
at that moment,

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.250
somewhere inside of him,
that little boy cried out,

01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:43.708
"I need this.
Don't worry about the money.
We'll get it back.

01:36:43.959 --> 01:36:45.708
"Be nice to me!"

01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:47.834
And he was.

01:36:49.542 --> 01:36:53.417
Your Honors,
I feel Mr. Miller
is sufficiently past

01:36:53.417 --> 01:36:55.250
the fears
that would keep him

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:58.208
from becoming a remarkable
citizen of the universe.

01:36:59.875 --> 01:37:03.667
I wholeheartedly recommend
full onward movement.

01:37:04.917 --> 01:37:05.917
I rest.

01:37:06.708 --> 01:37:08.166
JUDGE:  Miss Foster,
you're up.

01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:14.041
Your Honors,

01:37:14.041 --> 01:37:17.041
at this point, I would like
to show my final
summation scene.

01:37:17.542 --> 01:37:18.875
Proceed.

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:22.750
My scene takes place
not there, but here.

01:37:23.291 --> 01:37:24.458
What?

01:37:24.458 --> 01:37:26.583
What're we doing?
We're showing
something from here?

01:37:26.583 --> 01:37:27.959
Yes, we are.

01:37:27.959 --> 01:37:30.250
I was told we're not
doing that anymore.

01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:32.250
No one told you that,
Mr. Diamond.

01:37:33.083 --> 01:37:34.250
What are we seeing?

01:37:34.458 --> 01:37:35.875
Something
from last night.

01:37:36.208 --> 01:37:38.875
Mr. Miller,
please watch this,

01:37:39.208 --> 01:37:40.750
and tell me what
you were feeling.

01:37:42.917 --> 01:37:44.542
Last night?

01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:47.750
(BEEPING)

01:37:48.583 --> 01:37:50.208
JULIA:  Want to spend
the night with me?

01:37:50.708 --> 01:37:52.375
DANIEL:  More than anything
else in the world.

01:37:52.959 --> 01:37:54.583
JULIA:  Good.
Come on. Let's go.

01:37:54.583 --> 01:37:57.291
DANIEL:  I don't think I can.
I don't think I should.

01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:58.875
JULIA:  Why?

01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:01.333
If I had a fire scene
like you had today,

01:38:01.333 --> 01:38:03.125
I would
feel differently.
I'm sure.

01:38:03.125 --> 01:38:05.291
I'd stay here.
I'd never leave.

01:38:05.792 --> 01:38:09.125
But I've been defending
myself so hard
these last few days.

01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:11.083
And I just don't
wanna be judged anymore.

01:38:12.291 --> 01:38:14.166
I have this
wonderful feeling
inside of me,

01:38:14.166 --> 01:38:15.458
but I'm af--

01:38:16.625 --> 01:38:18.959
I'm just tired
of being judged.

01:38:30.166 --> 01:38:33.083
You genuinely feel
for this woman,
don't you, Mr. Miller?

01:38:33.792 --> 01:38:34.917
Yes.

01:38:36.125 --> 01:38:38.083
Why didn't you stay
with her last night?

01:38:40.083 --> 01:38:41.333
I was afraid.

01:38:42.291 --> 01:38:43.333
A little louder.

01:38:43.542 --> 01:38:44.792
I was afraid.

01:38:53.041 --> 01:38:54.125
I rest.

01:38:56.166 --> 01:38:58.458
Well, this is
a new one on me.

01:38:58.834 --> 01:39:01.500
Have sex with somebody
and move right on.

01:39:02.166 --> 01:39:04.333
Is that the way
it works, Miss Foster?

01:39:06.708 --> 01:39:08.667
I don't think
you're being very
understanding

01:39:08.667 --> 01:39:10.875
about the world
Mr. Miller
just came from.

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.000
It's filled with problems
you no longer have.

01:39:15.667 --> 01:39:18.667
Deadly diseases,
confusing identities,
changing attitudes.

01:39:19.208 --> 01:39:22.667
How do you know
Mr. Miller he wasn't worried
about getting a disease?

01:39:23.542 --> 01:39:25.875
Were you worried about
getting a disease,
Mr. Miller?

01:39:26.166 --> 01:39:28.083
I didn't think
she had a disease.

01:39:28.917 --> 01:39:30.708
You didn't think.
But you didn't know.

01:39:30.708 --> 01:39:32.041
We're getting
off the point.

01:39:32.041 --> 01:39:34.083
We've never been
near the point!

01:39:34.083 --> 01:39:35.917
You're getting
him both ways.

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.208
When he's courageous
and follows it up

01:39:38.208 --> 01:39:40.250
with something
you don't like,
you show the follow-up.

01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:41.625
When there aren't
any follow-ups,

01:39:41.625 --> 01:39:42.959
you blame him
for not having any.

01:39:42.959 --> 01:39:46.041
This is an example
of something he wanted to do

01:39:46.041 --> 01:39:48.917
and he didn't because
he was afraid.

01:39:49.417 --> 01:39:51.041
And this was just last night.

01:39:51.458 --> 01:39:53.708
DIAMOND:  May I tell you
what I think we just
watched here?

01:39:54.041 --> 01:39:56.875
I think we just watched a man
who was caring

01:39:56.875 --> 01:39:58.333
of another
human being's feelings.

01:39:59.166 --> 01:40:01.333
He didn't know
what this experience
would do to her,

01:40:01.542 --> 01:40:03.000
so he was careful.

01:40:04.166 --> 01:40:07.083
You blame him
for this.
I praise him for it.

01:40:07.959 --> 01:40:11.083
You call it fear.
I call it thoughtfulness.

01:40:11.917 --> 01:40:15.750
To be caring about
someone else's feelings.

01:40:17.083 --> 01:40:20.041
I'm sorry, but I hope
we all can have
that quality.

01:40:22.417 --> 01:40:23.708
Thank you.

01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:27.750
Mr. Miller, your final
summation, please.

01:40:28.792 --> 01:40:29.834
(SIGHS)

01:40:29.834 --> 01:40:32.083
Well, I think it was
thoughtfulness.

01:40:33.250 --> 01:40:35.625
And I would like to say
something about this disease.

01:40:36.417 --> 01:40:37.625
Your Honors,
I didn't think

01:40:37.625 --> 01:40:39.250
that Julia had a disease,

01:40:39.583 --> 01:40:42.083
but you must understand
that right now on earth,

01:40:42.333 --> 01:40:45.250
they're filling our heads
with all these
terrible things.

01:40:45.667 --> 01:40:48.125
They keep telling you
over and over

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:50.125
that you're not just sleeping
with one person.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.500
You're sleeping with everyone
they've ever slept with.

01:40:54.166 --> 01:40:56.667
Now that I've been
to the past lives pavilion,

01:40:57.125 --> 01:40:58.959
that could be
20,000 to 30,000 people.

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:00.500
(CHUCKLES)

01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:03.458
As far as the rest
of my life is concerned,

01:41:03.458 --> 01:41:05.792
I truly believe
I turned the corner.

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:08.542
I know
I had a few fears left,

01:41:08.542 --> 01:41:10.166
but I was taken
very young.

01:41:10.166 --> 01:41:12.000
I feel I could have
conquered them.

01:41:13.625 --> 01:41:16.500
So if you see fit to let me
move forward,

01:41:17.125 --> 01:41:19.750
I promise you
I will do the best I can.

01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:23.458
I'll work very hard,
I'll do whatever
is required of me.

01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:27.792
I'll do the best I can.
Honestly. I will.

01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:30.625
I'll do the best I can.

01:41:32.625 --> 01:41:34.000
Is that all,
Mr. Miller?

01:41:34.708 --> 01:41:36.125
Yeah.

01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.625
But please just know
that I'll--

01:41:39.625 --> 01:41:40.834
Do the best you can?

01:41:41.333 --> 01:41:42.959
Hmm.

01:41:42.959 --> 01:41:44.166
Good.

01:41:45.166 --> 01:41:46.792
That's all,
everybody.
Thank you.

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:57.625
It was nice to
meet you. Good luck.

01:42:00.667 --> 01:42:04.417
Well, that's it.
Let's go back
to my office and wait.

01:42:04.417 --> 01:42:05.667
We'll know
in 30 minutes.

01:42:24.041 --> 01:42:25.208
Judgment's in.

01:42:25.208 --> 01:42:26.708
It's early.

01:42:26.708 --> 01:42:27.792
Is that good?

01:42:27.792 --> 01:42:29.333
Not good or bad.

01:42:34.875 --> 01:42:35.917
They don't waste
any time.

01:42:35.917 --> 01:42:37.375
They must need
the hotel space.

01:42:41.875 --> 01:42:44.041
So what do you think
of our fair city?

01:42:44.250 --> 01:42:45.417
We do a pretty
good job here.

01:42:45.834 --> 01:42:46.917
How was that
Italian restaurant?

01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:48.250
What does it say?

01:42:49.875 --> 01:42:51.041
You're going back.

01:42:55.375 --> 01:42:56.750
Can I say something?

01:42:57.917 --> 01:42:59.417
Just because
they're sending you back,

01:42:59.417 --> 01:43:00.750
doesn't mean
that they're right.

01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:02.750
They can make a mistake.

01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:06.583
You shouldn't let
others get to you
like this.

01:43:08.083 --> 01:43:09.291
Just follow
what's in here.

01:43:13.542 --> 01:43:16.250
Come on. I'll take you
to the station.

01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:22.083
MAN: (OVER PA)
Trams 7 and 8
to onward destinations.

01:43:22.625 --> 01:43:24.458
This is something.
I never get over it.

01:43:24.458 --> 01:43:26.250
The organization
is amazing.

01:43:26.583 --> 01:43:28.083
All these different
trams going to

01:43:28.083 --> 01:43:29.375
all these
different places.

01:43:29.375 --> 01:43:32.083
WOMAN: (OVER PA)
All tunnels now
operational.

01:43:32.083 --> 01:43:33.250
These are yours,

01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:36.208
your boarding card,
your various I.D.
pieces,

01:43:36.208 --> 01:43:38.125
all the things
you're going to need.

01:43:38.417 --> 01:43:40.000
You're not going to
remember any of this.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.083
So don't worry.

01:43:41.417 --> 01:43:42.959
You won't
kick yourself forever.

01:43:43.333 --> 01:43:45.959
Take the opportunities
when they come. Okay?

01:43:47.458 --> 01:43:49.125
WOMAN:  Passengers going
back to earth,

01:43:49.125 --> 01:43:51.083
please board trams
on your left.

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:55.250
Passengers moving onward,
board trams on your right.

01:43:55.667 --> 01:43:57.625
Well, this is it.

01:43:59.291 --> 01:44:00.750
Good luck, kid.

01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:01.834
I've got a lot
of faith in you.

01:44:09.917 --> 01:44:11.125
FEMALE ATTENDANT:
I can take that here, sir.

01:44:11.792 --> 01:44:14.333
There you go.
You keep those,
and follow the yellow line.

01:44:19.834 --> 01:44:22.375
WOMAN:
All trams now operational.

01:44:26.375 --> 01:44:28.166
MALE ATTENDANT:
I'll take those, sir.

01:44:28.166 --> 01:44:31.792
MAN:  Trams 7 and 8

01:44:31.792 --> 01:44:34.000
final boarding, please.

01:44:42.333 --> 01:44:43.959
Right here, sir.

01:44:54.375 --> 01:44:57.500
WOMAN:  All personnel,
please prepare for departure.

01:45:00.875 --> 01:45:01.875
JULIA:  Daniel!

01:45:02.667 --> 01:45:03.708
Daniel!

01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:05.750
Daniel!

01:45:06.083 --> 01:45:07.208
Julia!

01:45:07.625 --> 01:45:08.875
Daniel!

01:45:08.875 --> 01:45:09.875
Julia!

01:45:21.041 --> 01:45:22.333
Julia!

01:45:28.875 --> 01:45:30.000
(ALARM SOUNDS)

01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:33.000
What the hell
are you doing?

01:45:36.542 --> 01:45:38.834
Sit down right now.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:42.875
(SECOND ALARM SOUNDS)

01:45:50.250 --> 01:45:51.250
Aah!

01:45:52.375 --> 01:45:53.417
(HORN HONKS)

01:46:08.417 --> 01:46:09.542
Julia!

01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:12.291
Julia!

01:46:12.917 --> 01:46:14.875
Julia!

01:46:15.417 --> 01:46:16.792
Daniel!

01:46:17.417 --> 01:46:18.750
Julia!

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.542
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)
(SCREAMS)

01:46:20.542 --> 01:46:22.500
Aah! Daniel!

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:24.375
I love you!
Oh, my God.

01:46:24.375 --> 01:46:26.500
I tried to call,
but I didn't know
your last name.

01:46:27.458 --> 01:46:29.583
I won't let you go!
I won't let you go!

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.083
Help! Help!

01:46:37.166 --> 01:46:38.291
Whoa!

01:46:38.583 --> 01:46:40.125
Aah! Hold on!

01:46:40.291 --> 01:46:42.625
Hold on.
Just please hold on.
Hold on.

01:46:43.166 --> 01:46:44.583
I love you.

01:46:44.583 --> 01:46:45.917
I love you.

01:46:50.458 --> 01:46:51.625
Open this up!

01:46:52.291 --> 01:46:54.083
Damn it!
Open it up!

01:46:54.083 --> 01:46:55.458
JULIA:  Please,
open the door!

01:46:56.792 --> 01:46:59.250
Julia!
Wait for me!

01:46:59.792 --> 01:47:01.125
Wait for me!

01:47:02.166 --> 01:47:03.417
Brave enough for you?

01:47:03.792 --> 01:47:07.041
JULIA:  Please! Open
the door, please!

01:47:09.166 --> 01:47:10.500
DANIEL:  Julia!

01:47:11.375 --> 01:47:12.375
(INAUDIBLE)

01:47:13.041 --> 01:47:14.208
Julia!

01:47:15.291 --> 01:47:16.333
Let him go.

01:47:20.208 --> 01:47:22.166
(APPLAUSE)
