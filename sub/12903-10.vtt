WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.501
Good morning.

00:02.503 --> 00:04.003
It's 5 minutes to 6:00,

00:04.005 --> 00:07.506
and it's a beautiful election
day here in Los Angeles.

00:07.508 --> 00:11.377
In one hour, polls will open
to decide if Joe Perry

00:11.379 --> 00:13.345
will get four more years

00:13.347 --> 00:15.014
or if
Councilman Richard Dreyfuss

00:15.016 --> 00:18.117
will be the new mayor
of the City of Angels.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.885
According to the latest polls,

00:19.887 --> 00:23.455
Mayor Perry is predicted to win
in a landslide.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.125
But Councilman
Dreyfuss remains confident

00:26.127 --> 00:29.695
that a massive conspiracy
will finally come to fruition,

00:29.697 --> 00:33.132
toppling Perry and placing him
in the mayor's mansion

00:33.134 --> 00:37.169
by what can only be described
as a coup d'etat.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.038
Will you be voting today?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.839
Vote in our online poll.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.509
Will you be voting
in our online poll?

00:43.511 --> 00:45.744
Vote in our other online poll.

00:45.746 --> 00:48.414
It is 6:00,
which means it's time

00:48.416 --> 00:51.316
for Stinkbomb
and the Monkey Man.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.052
Good morning, everybody!

00:53.054 --> 00:55.554
Hey, Monkey Man, who do
you like the mayor election?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.042 --> 01:17.576
After the target
is eliminated here,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.745
we meet Pepper
at the rendezvous point here.

01:19.747 --> 01:23.015
Restrooms here, Wetzel's Pretzels here.
Copy that.

01:23.017 --> 01:26.085
And what if LAPD decides to...
I don't know... shoot us?

01:26.087 --> 01:28.921
The only person that Mayhem
Global was afraid of was you.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.355
But now you're with us, right?

01:30.357 --> 01:33.092
If I wasn't,
would I have gotten this?

01:35.796 --> 01:38.230
Yeah. That turned out well.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.033
Package for 24601.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.369
Tribeca?

01:44.371 --> 01:45.904
That's me.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.706
Sign here.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.443
Thank you.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.715
This is gonna work.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.618
The only question is,
are you ready?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.421
I never thought I'd be
on the wrong side of the law,

02:02.423 --> 02:04.590
but that's where I find myself,

02:04.592 --> 02:07.126
and nothing's gonna change that.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.969
This changes everything.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.337
Tribeca!

02:18.339 --> 02:20.072
You've got a visitor!

02:26.480 --> 02:28.647
Hello? Kathy?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.315
There's no Kathy here.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.417
Sorry. Wrong number.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.755
Kathy?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.824
Hey, Dad.

02:39.994 --> 02:40.993
Tribeca, good news.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.594
The mayor is gonna let you go.

02:42.596 --> 02:46.098
Pardon me? The mayor
is gonna let you go.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.667
Eddie Pepper's prints were
all over the murder weapon,

02:48.669 --> 02:52.004
so the only question is,
whose side are you on?

02:52.006 --> 02:55.841
Geils, I'm 100% committed
to being a good guy,

02:55.843 --> 02:57.509
and I was about to bust out
of here anyway,

02:57.511 --> 02:58.777
so this just saves a step.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.812
I knew it. Let's go.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.158
Jason. Angela.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.727
Could I see you two in my office
for a quick powwow?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.563
It'll only take
a couple of minutes.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.032
Sure. What's with him?

03:20.034 --> 03:21.366
No idea.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.968
The mayor's life is in danger.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.837
I'm having Tanner and Hoffman
transport he and his wife

03:25.839 --> 03:28.540
to a safe house
at an undisclosed location.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.975
Should we know where that is

03:29.977 --> 03:32.077
just in case we need to get in
touch with each other?

03:32.079 --> 03:33.712
It's really best
if as few people

03:33.714 --> 03:35.013
know the location as possible.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.049
It's just
I have Tanner's inhaler.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.218
And I would just be a little
worried if he had an attack.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.386
It's really safest
if I'm the only one who knows.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.654
Got it. Got it. Yeah.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.855
What's the address?

03:43.857 --> 03:45.958
113...

03:46.560 --> 03:47.926
Nice try.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.728
Tribeca, I'm putting you
in charge of security

03:49.730 --> 03:51.029
at the Biltmore Hotel,

03:51.031 --> 03:53.232
where the mayor's gala
will take place.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.533
We're on high alert

03:54.535 --> 03:56.868
since Diane Duran
escaped from prison.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.905
She escaped? When?
About an hour ago.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.107
Smuggled out in a laundry bin,
hijacked a van,

04:02.109 --> 04:04.209
mesmerized the driver
with her beauty.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.544
She could be anywhere.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.912
Geils, see if you can
pick up her trail

04:06.914 --> 04:10.082
and neutralize her
by any means available.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.152
Geils.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.055
Forget about Duran.
Keep an eye on Tribeca.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.257
I'm telling you,
Lieutenant... She's not crooked.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.260
The gym teacher
checked her out this morning.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.428
We cannot take a chance
with the mayor's life.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.796
If she is in on this,

04:24.798 --> 04:26.965
you have to be prepared
to take her down.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.935
You're asking me to choose
between the woman I love

04:29.937 --> 04:33.605
and the mayor, who quite frankly
has done a pretty crappy job

04:33.607 --> 04:35.207
at running the city
the last few years.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.576
Hey! That is our mayor
you're talking about.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.378
How would you like it
if you heard him

04:39.380 --> 04:41.013
saying mean things about you?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.650
I'm talking to you.
Pretty bad, I guess.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.152
All right. Go play.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.810
Welcome, ma'am.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.378
Thanks.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.921
Sir.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.523
Okay.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.895
What are you doing?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.530
Tribeca.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.733
Are you tailing me? Not at all.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.836
I'm here to look at ballrooms
for my high-school reunion.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.371
Didn't you grow up in Chicago?

06:12.373 --> 06:13.572
Good point.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.973
No one's gonna drive
all the way out here.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.175
Well, I'll see you later.
Let me guess.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.911
The lieutenant told you to
follow me to see if I'm dirty.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.214
Let me let you in
on a little secret...

06:22.216 --> 06:23.882
I <i> am</i> dirty.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.384
Extremely dirty.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.952
Like you...

06:31.558 --> 06:33.859
You seem different.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.628
All women should go to prison.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.332
Hey! Get a room!

06:40.334 --> 06:43.068
Front desk is that way.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.236
Okay.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.038
City view or pool view?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.373
Either one.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.909
Let's see.
I'm gonna put you by the pool.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.511
Smoking or non-smoking? Sure.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.347
For an additional $89,
I can upgrade you to a suite.

06:55.349 --> 06:56.448
Whatever's fastest.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.749
The upgrade is fast. Great.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.017
But it won't be ready till 3:00.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.919
No, no. No upgrade, then.
No upgrade.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.587
I'm gonna need a credit card
for incidentals, please.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.056
Take it.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.691
I see
you're a rewards club member.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.093
Would you like
to pay with points?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.428
No, just charge it.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.796
You have 19,000 points.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.964
Sir, please just give us a room.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.766
Hurry up!

07:14.768 --> 07:16.234
Okay, but if you pay
with points,

07:16.236 --> 07:18.637
you're eligible for
a free continental breakfast.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.938
Just give us a room!

07:19.940 --> 07:22.207
That would be a basket
of fresh pastries,

07:22.209 --> 07:23.475
a hot pot of tea or coffee,

07:23.477 --> 07:24.810
and a glass
of fresh-squeezed juice.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.878
Sir!
I cannot stress this enough.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.613
We just want keys to a room.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.315
Okay.
How many keys would you like?

07:30.317 --> 07:31.950
One key, right now.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.286
Boy.
Key reader's gone on the fritz.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.821
Dale!

07:35.823 --> 07:39.391
Okay, I clicked on 601, then
star, enter, and then print.

07:39.393 --> 07:41.593
No, no. That's the old system.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.962
Why don't I help you folks
here at my station?

07:43.964 --> 07:44.964
My God!

07:58.479 --> 08:01.446
So sorry about that.
Here you go.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.687
Lieutenant Atkins
recommends that you all stay

08:08.689 --> 08:11.590
in the safe house until
any potential threat subsides.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.263
How do we even know
these threats are credible?

08:18.265 --> 08:21.333
We have multiple sources who
have corroborated the threats.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.034
Dear. That's terrifying.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.805
Sir, ma'am, your safety
is our highest priority,

08:26.807 --> 08:29.307
and this is the only place
the department can assure you

08:29.309 --> 08:32.344
that nothing, absolutely
nothing, will happen to you.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.845
Well, I think it's lovely.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.847
Do you at least know
who's behind all this nonsense?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.549
We believe it's an organization

08:37.551 --> 08:38.884
called Mayhem Global

08:38.885 --> 08:40.885
headed up by an ex-cop
named Edward Pepper

08:40.888 --> 08:43.488
and a former FBI operative
named Diane Duran

08:43.490 --> 08:44.890
who escaped from prison
this morning.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.658
So you know nothing. Great.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.226
We don't fully understand
their motive,

08:48.228 --> 08:51.396
but we do that they're very
interested in Dreyfuss' victory.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.532
And one thing
that they're not interested in

08:53.534 --> 08:55.000
is whether you live or die.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.703
If anybody kills my husband,
it's going to be me.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.971
This is ridiculous.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.573
You can't tell me what to do.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.542
I'm a grown mayor,
and today is my re-election.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.010
I've got a vote to cast,

09:05.012 --> 09:06.645
and I've got
a victory party to attend.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.713
Mayor Perry
doesn't cower in fear.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.949
Come on, Katie. Okay.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.091
No-o-o-o!

09:23.764 --> 09:26.865
How in the hell
did they get to the safe house?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.367
No idea, but we moved
the the mayor to an Arby's,

09:29.369 --> 09:30.669
hoping for better luck.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.537
We came as soon as we heard,

09:32.539 --> 09:34.205
and then we left
for the precinct.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.707
I'm tired of playing catch-up
with these guys.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.276
We need a plan.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.412
And we need one
before the mayor casts his vote

09:40.414 --> 09:42.347
on live TV
at the elementary school.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.515
How about this for a plan?

09:43.517 --> 09:45.517
The mayor casts his vote
on live TV

09:45.519 --> 09:46.952
at the elementary school.

09:46.954 --> 09:50.589
Um, that's a great idea,
Tribeca.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.024
But just for the heck of it,
why don't we keep brainstorming?

09:53.026 --> 09:55.226
No, don't you see? It's perfect.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.228
We do exactly
what Pepper's expecting.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.531
We put the mayor
where Pepper wants him,

09:59.533 --> 10:01.733
and then when the mouse
goes in for the cheese...

10:01.735 --> 10:03.735
He eats the cheese.
We spring the trap.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.937
Unless someone's
got a better metaphor,

10:05.939 --> 10:07.539
we go with Tribeca's plan.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.874
I got something with a fox
and a chicken guarding a bridge,

10:09.876 --> 10:12.477
but it's just not coming together.
Let's move.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.280
Hey.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.549
I noticed the lieutenant
was playing the guitar.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.085
Okay. Calm down, Detective.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.820
You got the job.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.900
Mr. Mayor!

10:35.902 --> 10:37.569
How do you feel today
about the election?!

10:39.406 --> 10:40.939
Who you
gonna vote for, Mr. Mayor?

10:40.941 --> 10:42.574
Are you feeling confident?

10:42.576 --> 10:44.843
You ran
a good campaign, Mr. Mayor.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.277
They're totally buying it.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.114
Remind me to give Jenkins in
our creature shop an "attaboy."

10:49.116 --> 10:50.115
Will do.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.816
It's incredible, isn't it?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.853
Tribeca, Tanner,
the package is coming inside.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.921
What package?
What's it look like?

10:56.923 --> 10:59.591
Is it for me?
The fake mayor we made.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.359
I see him. Wow!

11:01.361 --> 11:03.161
Jenkins really nailed it
this time.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.897
Remind me to tell him what a
great job he... Already on it.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.967
Where's the actual mayor?

11:08.969 --> 11:13.371
Completely safe inside
that soft-top Jeep over there.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.848
My God. My God.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.317
Well, now it doesn't
even matter if he wins.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.487
The city's not paying for that.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.489
Mr. Mayor, you're all right?
Yes.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.391
Fortunately, I went
to go get a shave ice

11:33.393 --> 11:34.659
at exactly the right moment.

11:34.661 --> 11:38.563
A shave ice?
In this part of town?

11:40.801 --> 11:41.933
Duran.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.907
Don't eat that.
It could be poison.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.010
Jenkins.

11:57.684 --> 11:58.983
Stop! Police!

12:15.602 --> 12:17.469
Ha ha!

12:32.085 --> 12:33.985
Yeah!

12:37.724 --> 12:40.391
Ha ha!

12:43.063 --> 12:44.729
Damn!

12:44.731 --> 12:47.899
How the hell did Pepper know
that the mayor was in that Jeep?

12:47.901 --> 12:51.936
He's obvious got someone
inside the police department.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.241
I didn't do it. God!

12:56.243 --> 12:57.442
Go to the dark side one time,

12:57.444 --> 12:58.643
and suddenly you're <i> that</i> guy.

12:58.645 --> 12:59.911
Well, I'm tired of hiding.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.579
I'm the mayor of Los Angeles.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.947
And as of 10:00 tonight,

13:02.949 --> 13:04.783
I'm gonna be
the <i> mayor</i> of Los Angeles,

13:04.785 --> 13:06.751
so you do what you need to do.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.787
I've got a victory gala
to attend.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.088
Hang on, Joe.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.724
I'm taking personal
responsibility for your safety.

13:12.726 --> 13:16.094
Detectives, I'm counting on you
to bring down Mayhem Global.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.030
And until then, I'm
not leaving the mayor's side.

13:24.905 --> 13:28.173
Tribeca. I think you guys better
get down here and see this.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.643
I think I figured out
why the lieutenant's

13:31.645 --> 13:33.178
been acting so strangely.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.182
What the...

13:37.184 --> 13:40.285
If the lieutenant is here,
who's protecting the mayor?

13:40.287 --> 13:41.653
It's Eddie Pepper.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.655
He's gonna kill the mayor
posing as the lieutenant.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.875
Eddie Pepper's in there.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.109
He's gonna kill the mayor.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.377
We don't have much time.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.571
Let's rock and roll.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.210
LAPD. Step aside.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.645
The mayor's life is in danger.
I'm sorry.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.213
We received strict instructions

14:42.215 --> 14:43.748
not to let any police officers
in the ballroom.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.316
From who? You.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.685
Like half an hour ago, and you
were kind of a dick about it.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.521
Well, I am reversing that
and ordering you to let us in.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.357
You said you would try
to reverse the order

14:52.359 --> 14:53.424
and we should ignore you.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.994
Damn it.
I'm one step ahead of me.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.929
Okay, well, thanks, anyway.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.764
Good night, guys.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.001
What was that?

15:03.003 --> 15:04.669
We're just gonna give up?

15:04.671 --> 15:06.070
So, Dreyfuss is the mayor.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.272
They're all the same anyway.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.873
No, we're not
just gonna give up.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.842
Tanner, come with me.
We're gonna find a back way in.

15:10.844 --> 15:12.744
You two, get in that ballroom.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.227
Sorry, folks. LAPD.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.362
I'm gonna need
to commandeer your outfits.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.799
Aah!

15:34.801 --> 15:36.567
Works every time.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.713
Thank you.

16:07.767 --> 16:08.933
There's Duran.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.536
Get over here.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.905
Sorry.
The split screen threw me.

16:13.907 --> 16:15.173
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:15.175 --> 16:17.842
the final results
of the election are in!

16:19.346 --> 16:21.679
There's the mayor.
He's with Pepper.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.148
Second runner-up
is Abraham McCheese

16:24.150 --> 16:25.450
with 2% of the vote.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.286
First runner-up
with 12% of the vote

16:28.288 --> 16:31.022
is Councilman Richard Dreyfuss.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.523
You know what that means, folks.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.959
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you

16:34.961 --> 16:39.697
the former and next mayor
of Los Angeles, Mayor Joe Perry!

16:46.039 --> 16:47.505
She's got a gun!

16:49.209 --> 16:51.376
Get down! Get down!

17:00.520 --> 17:01.819
Atkins, have you lost your mind?

17:01.821 --> 17:04.388
It's not safe for you
in there, Mr. Mayor.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.391
I'm afraid you're not safe
here either, Mr. Mayor.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.724
What the hell is this?

17:07.727 --> 17:09.827
Sir, the Lieutenant Atkins
standing next to you

17:09.829 --> 17:12.063
is not the Atkins
you've come to know and love,

17:12.065 --> 17:13.865
but rather
a rogue police officer

17:13.867 --> 17:16.300
who left the force
10 years ago...

17:16.301 --> 17:18.636
Sergeant Eddie Pepper.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.642
God, it's good
to be young again!

17:24.644 --> 17:27.512
Now, I'm gonna have to ask you
to drop your weapons,

17:27.513 --> 17:29.213
or I'm gonna drop your mayor.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.415
That's ridiculous.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.416
There's four of us
and one of you.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.984
Make that two of us.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.319
Drop your weapons.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.998
We did it, Eddie.
We got the mayor.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.032
How does it feel?

17:48.034 --> 17:49.267
It feels pretty damn good.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.403
How does it feel now?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.405
Diane, I don't mean
to micromanage,

17:54.407 --> 17:56.340
but you just shot <i> me,</i>
not the <i> mayor.</i>

17:59.579 --> 18:00.278
Tribeca?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.413
Angie?

18:02.415 --> 18:03.848
Don't worry, Eddie.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.583
I shot you through
the fleshy part of your abdomen

18:05.585 --> 18:06.784
where there's no vital organs.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.753
You'll be fine. You sure?

18:10.356 --> 18:12.924
Wait. If you're Tribeca,
then who's...

18:12.926 --> 18:14.292
who's this?

18:19.399 --> 18:20.798
But you had sex with me!

18:20.800 --> 18:22.967
That is so unethical.

18:22.969 --> 18:27.605
I would be extremely upset
if I were actually Geils.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.942
You were a masterful lover.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.477
Well, I thought
you were Tribeca,

18:32.479 --> 18:34.145
so there was an added level
of kink to it.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.813
Well, then who did I tie up?

18:35.815 --> 18:36.948
My twin brother, Eric.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.617
Remember him
from Season 1, Episode 4?

18:39.619 --> 18:40.918
No, I don't really
follow the show.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.653
I'm just doing a cameo
for a friend.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.122
Well, he was established.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.923
Mom says hi.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.559
I think there's one thing
you all overlooked.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.166
Mom?!

18:55.168 --> 18:56.834
What? You never call me.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.137
And I thought it would be fun
to do something together.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.272
Wait a minute.
Then where is Geils?

19:01.274 --> 19:02.607
The bigger question is,

19:02.609 --> 19:05.443
Tribeca, what the hell
is going on?

19:05.445 --> 19:07.678
It all started in prison.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.614
Duran and I
were going over Pepper's plan

19:09.616 --> 19:11.916
for us to break out
and help him kill the mayor

19:11.918 --> 19:13.584
when a package arrived.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.256
Geils had overnighted
our baby to me

19:18.258 --> 19:20.925
as a reminder
of how much I had to lose.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.527
This changes everything.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.462
I suddenly realized
I wanted baby Angela

19:24.464 --> 19:26.531
to grow up in a world
with right and wrong,

19:26.533 --> 19:28.366
with good guys and bad guys

19:28.368 --> 19:29.934
and a mother
who could tell the difference.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.336
I easily convinced Diane Duran

19:32.338 --> 19:34.038
to come back
to the right side of the law,

19:34.040 --> 19:36.674
and together, we hatched
a plan to stop Eddie Pepper

19:36.676 --> 19:37.808
before he could kill the mayor.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.143
Hang on a second.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.545
You easily convinced Diane Duran

19:40.547 --> 19:42.880
to come back
to the right side of the law?

19:42.882 --> 19:46.117
That sounds
ridiculously implausible.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.552
It's a little less implausible

19:47.554 --> 19:50.454
if you consider that she was
on the right side all along.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.861
Wait. So, then
who ended up having sex?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.901
So, Geils...

20:03.903 --> 20:06.571
that means
you had my back all along.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.573
It's a pretty great back.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.808
So, what do you think?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.410
You want to catch criminals
and raise a baby?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.979
Sounds good to me.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.083
You all right?

20:19.085 --> 20:22.620
I think I'm just slipping
into shock.
