WEBVTT

00:03.796 --> 00:06.007
- Hey.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.

00:06.173 --> 00:09.093
Look, can we talk
about what happened here last night?

00:09.301 --> 00:13.055
Sure. Just give me a second
to get all huffy and weird like you.

00:13.514 --> 00:19.061
You believe that whoever did something
last night did what they did or didn't do?

00:19.729 --> 00:22.356
Okay, you really don't know
what I'm talking about?

00:22.565 --> 00:25.026
- No.
- Okay. Last night, after the party...

00:25.192 --> 00:28.779
...I saw Rachel kissing that jerk
from her office out on your balcony.

00:28.988 --> 00:30.406
Our balcony? Seriously?

00:30.573 --> 00:33.951
That's so funny. I told Monica
we should put lights on our balcony...

00:34.118 --> 00:37.788
...and she said, "No, no. It's too cold.
Nobody will go out there." And I said:

00:37.955 --> 00:40.416
"Maybe if we put some lights
out there they will."

00:42.793 --> 00:46.464
Right, that's what I came over to talk
about. I saw Rachel kissing some guy...

00:46.630 --> 00:50.384
...on your balcony,
even though there were no lights!

00:51.594 --> 00:54.305
So are you gonna talk to her?

00:54.513 --> 00:58.350
Why? Why should I? I mean,
if she wants to move on, that's fine.

00:58.559 --> 01:02.146
You know when "that's fine" sounds
true? When someone yells it and spits.

01:02.897 --> 01:07.610
No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wants
to date people, fine. I don't care.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.945
But at least she could have told me.

01:10.112 --> 01:13.616
You know, I've been putting my life on
hold and concentrating on Emma.

01:13.824 --> 01:19.455
But if she wants to go out there kissing
guys she barely knows, then so will I.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.752
Very funny! Ross is gay! Ha, ha.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.130
No, no.
Good, so you're moving on.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.800
Do you have any idea
where you're moving on to?

01:31.008 --> 01:32.885
I've got plenty of opportunities.

01:33.052 --> 01:37.556
Just now, there was some woman
at the coffeehouse smiled at me.

01:37.723 --> 01:43.270
And then the other day on the subway,
a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.

01:43.938 --> 01:48.275
Dude, don't rub my face
in your crazy single life.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.195
And there's an anthropologist
atschooL"

01:51.362 --> 01:55.116
...who totally came on to me during
the interdepartmental potluck dinner.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.952
Why did I get married?

02:49.378 --> 02:52.047
Hey, let me ask you guys something.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.008
I'm having new headshots
taken tomorrow.

02:54.175 --> 02:57.511
The photographer said she thinks
I should have my eyebrows waxed.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.972
Is that weird for a guy?

03:00.181 --> 03:02.349
- Well, it depends.
- On?

03:02.558 --> 03:05.394
On how far along he is
in the sex-change process.

03:07.062 --> 03:11.025
No, I totally disagree. I think it's fine
for a guy to do something like that.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.776
Especially an actor.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.863
I mean, not that you need to.
Your eyebrows are...

03:20.075 --> 03:22.870
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,
you're freaking me out.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.372
Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.876
Oh, man, now I have to get
those done too?

03:29.084 --> 03:33.130
- Wow, talk about high maintenance.
- You dye your hair.

03:33.339 --> 03:36.550
- I'm a woman.
- Double standards!

03:37.843 --> 03:40.804
Before I forget, are you coming
to Mike's piano bar tonight?

03:41.013 --> 03:44.850
- Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
- But everybody sings. It's so fun.

03:45.017 --> 03:49.188
Last time, this adorable old man got up
there, forgot all the words, flipped out...

03:49.355 --> 03:53.734
...and everyone booed him off the stage.
It was so funny.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.404
Look, I'm not good at singing.

03:57.613 --> 04:01.742
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
You afraid I'm a better singer?

04:01.909 --> 04:04.119
You afraid I'm gonna beat you
at singing?

04:06.413 --> 04:09.875
Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.

04:10.042 --> 04:13.087
Wow, I must be growing up.

04:14.755 --> 04:19.134
Okay, fine. Just please come and
support Mike. You don't have to sing.

04:19.343 --> 04:23.472
So I don't have to sing, and I can just sit
there and pass judgment on others?

04:23.681 --> 04:25.933
- While drinking.
- I'm there.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.938
Hi, you guys.
Listen, I really need your help.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.607
I think I did something
really stupid.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.444
Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something
so beautiful out of it.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.866
No, not that.
I kissed Gavin last night.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.159
- My God.
- You kissed him?

04:44.326 --> 04:46.912
Yeah, it was after the party,
we were on the balcony...

04:47.121 --> 04:50.457
Wait, wait, wait. I was at home
the whole time. How did I miss that?

04:50.666 --> 04:54.795
Well, it was the end of the party. You
were probably ironing wrapping paper.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.214
Oh, yeah.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.802
So how did you end up kissing?

05:02.011 --> 05:04.346
We were all alone
and he was being really nice...

05:04.513 --> 05:07.725
- ...and he gave me this scarf.
- I thought you hated him.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.644
Well, there is a thin line
between love and hate...

05:10.811 --> 05:15.399
...and it turns out that line
is a scarf.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.820
Are you thinking of starting
something up with this guy?

05:19.987 --> 05:23.032
I don't know. It's so complicated.
I work with this guy.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.744
I have the baby, and I have Ross.
I don't know what to do.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.164
And I have to be at the office
and see Gavin in 10 minutes.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.917
Sounds like you need to think
about what you want and talk to Gavin.

05:34.084 --> 05:38.047
- And you definitely should talk to Ross.
- Or...

05:38.672 --> 05:41.800
...I could call in sick
and not deal with it at all.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.804
Wow! Five months maternity leave,
you're back for four days...

05:45.971 --> 05:50.267
...kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
They are lucky to have you.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.318
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:59.485 --> 06:04.281
- I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
- Name?

06:04.490 --> 06:06.241
Chandler Bing.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.162
Okay, very good.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.540
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
and Sonya will be right with you.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.793
- Okay. Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.362
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.327
Uh-oh.

07:01.213 --> 07:04.133
I touched the stuff.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.219
I'll take care of it.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.766
Thanks.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.019
So do you...?
Do you get a lot of guys in here?

07:16.186 --> 07:18.981
- Oh, absolutely.
- Oh, good.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.818
- You looking to meet somebody?
- All right, let's just do this.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.655
Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.575
First, I want to tweeze
some of the strays, okay?

07:29.741 --> 07:33.704
- Now, this may sting just a little bit.
- I have an extremely high threshold...

07:33.871 --> 07:37.958
Holy Mother of God!
Oh, my face! My face!

07:44.006 --> 07:46.300
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.845
It's just a bit of shock, that's all.

07:50.012 --> 07:54.475
- But I'll be fine. You can go again.
- Okay.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.646
Sorry.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.446
Damn it, woman!

08:07.613 --> 08:10.324
QW, ow! Oh!

08:12.701 --> 08:14.620
Okay.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.584
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

08:20.751 --> 08:24.171
It's the most eligible man in New York.
How's the moving on going?

08:25.839 --> 08:29.885
Not well. I went on the subway again
and someone did sit on my hand...

08:30.052 --> 08:34.014
...but that person was neither female
nor wearing pants.

08:35.432 --> 08:39.394
Maybe you're going about this
the wrong way. I mean, think about it:

08:39.561 --> 08:44.024
Single white male, divorced three times,
two illegitimate children.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.904
The personal ad writes itself.

08:49.905 --> 08:53.867
You know, that's funny. Yeah.
So do you think you'll ever work again?

08:55.369 --> 08:58.664
What are you doing?
You know I can only dish it out.

08:59.414 --> 09:03.919
I can't believe Rachel just moved on
and didn't say anything to me.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.712
Maybe she didn't move on.

09:05.879 --> 09:09.508
Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
one-time birthday thing.

09:09.675 --> 09:12.678
No, a month ago, she gave her number
to some guy in a bar.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.972
- Did she go out with him?
- No. When he called...

09:15.138 --> 09:16.640
...I threw the message away.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.477
Ah, the highroad.

09:21.228 --> 09:25.691
All right, you know what? Enough.
Enough talking. I have to get moving.

09:26.275 --> 09:30.946
Hey, check out those two blonds
over there. Hey, come with me.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.782
Are you trying to get
everybody divorced?

09:34.408 --> 09:37.869
You don't have to do anything.
It'll just be easier if it's two of us.

09:38.036 --> 09:42.374
Like college, remember? First, you
break the ice with some kind of a joke...

09:42.541 --> 09:46.628
...so they know you're the funny one. I
swoop in with interesting conversation...

09:46.795 --> 09:51.049
...so they'll see that I'm the brilliant,
brooding sexy one.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.471
I thought I got to make the jokes.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.435
- Don't you have to be at work?
- Oh, come on.

10:04.104 --> 10:09.109
Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.
This is my friend Ross right here.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.861
We were wondering...

10:11.028 --> 10:15.032
...if you're up for it, we only need
six more people for a human pyramid.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.910
Swoop. Swoop.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.789
Uh... So, um...

10:22.956 --> 10:26.752
Hey, I notice
you're reading the paper.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.254
Another flood in Europe, huh?

10:31.632 --> 10:33.717
Um, here's a question:

10:35.010 --> 10:40.140
Would you rather drown
or be burned alive?

10:41.475 --> 10:45.896
- I'm sorry, we're just leaving.
- Okay.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.734
We still got it.

10:59.785 --> 11:03.830
- Who is it?
- Gavin. I brought you some soup.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.500
- Why?
- Uh, I heard your were sick.

11:06.667 --> 11:10.545
Oh, right! Hold on,
let me just clean up in here a little bit.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.392
Hello, Gavin.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.269
I missed you at work.
How you feeling?

11:26.478 --> 11:30.190
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.527
Oh, good. Because I was having
a totally paranoid moment...

11:33.694 --> 11:35.904
...where I thought you
called in sick to avoid me.

11:36.113 --> 11:39.032
Oh, no, no, no.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.870
So I had fun last night.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.540
So did I.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.461
Exactly how contagious
is this thing you have?

11:51.628 --> 11:56.883
Is it a cold from standing on
the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?

11:57.426 --> 12:00.303
- It's just a cold.
- Do you have a fever?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.764
Let me see.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.311
Um...

12:08.478 --> 12:10.188
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

12:10.355 --> 12:12.858
What's Ross doing to you
in that picture?

12:13.024 --> 12:16.778
Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.365
He thought it would be funny.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.784
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.953
- Ross.
- Yeah.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.957
What's the deal with you guys? I don't
wanna get in the middle of anything.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.961
Oh, you're not getting in the middle
of anything. Don't worry about Ross.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.757
Hide! That's Ross! Hide!

12:37.340 --> 12:39.634
- Hide! Hide!
- Yeah, but you said not to worry...

12:39.801 --> 12:42.596
I lied and I'm not sick either!
Just stay behind the curtain!

12:46.683 --> 12:49.770
- Hi.
- Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.814
No. I'm here to take Emma
to your mother's, remember?

12:53.023 --> 12:54.608
Right. Yes, yes.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.652
- Don't panic.
- What?

12:57.819 --> 13:00.071
There is a man behind your curtain.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.867
- I have Mace in my purse.
- No, that's okay! No, no, no.

13:04.034 --> 13:09.080
This is my business associate Gavin
being silly. Come out from behind there.

13:10.332 --> 13:13.460
Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.880
It was my idea to stand there.

13:17.047 --> 13:21.343
- Hello. I'll just go get Emma.
- Okay.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.764
So...

13:25.931 --> 13:29.726
- ...why did I have to hide?
- I thought it was Ross.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.687
I thought there was nothing
going on between you.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.856
There isn't. There totally isn't.

13:35.023 --> 13:39.611
You hear keys in the hall and you jump
like a bronco coming out of the chute.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.074
I used to be a rodeo clown.

13:45.784 --> 13:49.663
Um, all right, look, Gavin...

13:52.123 --> 13:56.002
...I guess I felt guilty
that you were here...

13:56.169 --> 13:58.171
...Which I shouldn't.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.925
You know, Ross and I
are not in a relationship...

14:02.092 --> 14:06.638
...but he is the father of my child.
And, you know...

14:06.847 --> 14:10.433
...we do live together. And plus,
there's just so much history, you know?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.519
It's just... I don't know.

14:12.686 --> 14:16.815
- I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.
- It's okay.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.944
It's probably not my place,
but can I give you a piece of advice?

14:21.111 --> 14:24.573
- Yes.
- You should talk to Ross about all this.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.076
People keep saying that.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.414
Oh, I'm sorry, Gavin.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.249
Don't be.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.085
It's just bad timing.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.547
So seriously, rodeo clown?

14:41.423 --> 14:44.092
One of the best, ma'am.
One of the best.

14:48.972 --> 14:52.017
No time for losers

14:52.183 --> 14:57.564
'Cause we are the champions

14:57.731 --> 15:01.818
Of the world

15:12.454 --> 15:16.207
Oh, she's my girlfriend.
That's not just how we do it here.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.960
I'm gonna take a little break,
and when we come back...

15:19.127 --> 15:22.505
...we've got Kenneth singing
"I Touch Myself."

15:23.173 --> 15:25.842
I'm not here to judge.

15:29.304 --> 15:32.515
- You have got to sing.
- No, I told you I can't.

15:32.724 --> 15:36.186
But you would have so much fun.
And you have a really nice voice.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.940
- When have you heard me sing?
- All the time, when you're cooking.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.733
- What?
- Yeah, you're always singing:

15:41.900 --> 15:44.694
"Yummy, yummy, yummy,
I've got love in my tummy."

15:46.029 --> 15:47.697
Yeah, I do rock that one.

15:49.908 --> 15:53.078
Isn't there just a little part of you
that wants to get up there?

15:53.954 --> 15:57.332
Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.501
I don't even know what I would sing.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.379
- Well, I've got a book around...
- "Delta Dawn."

16:10.971 --> 16:16.351
Hi. I couldn't help but notice,
but that's an unusual necklace.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.396
You already hit on me an hour ago.

16:21.064 --> 16:24.734
Right. So that's a firm no?

16:30.615 --> 16:33.535
I don't believe this.
I just keep striking out.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.162
I don't get it either.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.040
I mean, you're obviously desperate.

16:39.207 --> 16:43.044
You're asking women
how they wanna be killed.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.339
This is great.
Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys...

16:46.506 --> 16:50.385
...until she finds the one she wants,
and I'm gonna die alone.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.555
By drowning or...?

16:55.140 --> 16:59.185
- Why would he break up with me?
- I don't know, sweetie.

16:59.352 --> 17:03.648
All I ever wanted was to just love him
and have him love me back.

17:03.815 --> 17:07.569
I mean, am I so unlovable?

17:07.736 --> 17:10.864
- Wow.
- I know.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.586
All right. That was Kenneth with his...

17:24.752 --> 17:28.548
...much too literal rendition
of "I Touch Myself."

17:28.715 --> 17:32.927
Coming up next, we've got Monica
singing "Delta Dawn."

17:33.511 --> 17:36.014
Wait. I can't sing in
front of all these people.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.600
Just pretend they're not
even here. It's okay.

17:38.767 --> 17:43.438
Once that spotlight hits you, it's so
bright, you won't see anyone anyway.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.737
Hi, I'm Monica. And I'm going
to be singing "Delta Dawn."

18:00.413 --> 18:06.586
Delta Dawn
What's that flower you have on?

18:06.753 --> 18:13.468
Could it be a faded rose
From days gone by?

18:14.928 --> 18:19.390
- Can you totally see through her shirt?
- Like an x-ray.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.311
Bad day not to wear a bra.

18:23.520 --> 18:30.276
Take me to that mansion in the sky

18:34.447 --> 18:35.573
Hey.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.243
I need your help.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.372
Wow, it seems serious.

18:42.997 --> 18:46.126
What seems to be the problem,
Ashley Judd?

18:46.292 --> 18:50.296
I'm getting new headshots taken.
So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.424
I'm sorry.
Moment to make fun of that, please.

18:54.134 --> 18:58.263
I may be a sissy, but I'll still
pound you into the ground.

18:58.471 --> 19:02.308
Look, it hurt so bad, I could only
let her do one eyebrow, and now...

19:02.475 --> 19:05.228
...they don't match!

19:17.949 --> 19:21.661
It's like a baby caterpillar
chasing its mama.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.998
You gotta help me out, okay?
Look, I have a magic marker.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.126
Fill in the skinny one
so I don't look stupid for my pictures.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.920
Okay, first of all, this is green.

19:31.379 --> 19:34.174
- What the hell am I supposed to do?!
- I will help you out...

19:34.340 --> 19:38.970
...but you have to promise you won't
tell anyone what I'm about to tell you.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.764
What? What?

19:42.098 --> 19:43.433
Okay.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.728
You know how most kids get their
allowance from mowing the lawn...

19:46.895 --> 19:51.482
...or taking out the garbage?
Well, I earned mine...

19:51.649 --> 19:57.614
...by plucking the eyebrows of my father
and his "business partners."

20:02.202 --> 20:04.037
Oh, my God.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.790
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need
my help, Victor-Victoria.

20:07.999 --> 20:11.044
No, no, no. I do. I do.
I need your help.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.881
But, Chandler, I don't know if I can take
any more plucking. It hurt so bad.

20:15.089 --> 20:19.844
Not with my combination of ice cubes,
aloe vera and my gentle...

20:20.011 --> 20:23.556
...self-loathing touch.

20:26.059 --> 20:32.190
Take me to that mansion in the sky

20:36.986 --> 20:38.905
Aww...

20:39.113 --> 20:41.866
I'm sorry, the song's over.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.413
- Did you see me up there?
- Every little bit of you.

20:48.790 --> 20:52.252
I can't believe I sang
in front of people and they liked me.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.046
Did you hear that guy shouting,
"Look at those tips"?

20:55.213 --> 20:59.092
I mean, did I really help
you get a lot of tips?

20:59.259 --> 21:00.385
Sure.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.682
- Mon, not that you didn't sound good...
- Good?

21:05.890 --> 21:09.310
Didn't you hear them? I was great!

21:09.477 --> 21:14.148
Thank you so much for making me
do this. That is the best gift ever.

21:14.357 --> 21:17.110
Also a good gift: underwear.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.491
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

21:23.700 --> 21:27.787
Public bathrooms freak me out. I can't
even pee, let alone do anything else.

21:28.204 --> 21:31.833
But what's great is, you don't
mind talking about it.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.629
It is so amazing that I met you on the
same day that Eric broke up with me...

21:36.796 --> 21:40.675
...because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,
and you get a boyfriend.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.552
Uh-huh.

21:43.011 --> 21:47.974
No, don't worry. This is not some
rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.101
Phew.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.692
Good choice, Ross.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.654
Oh, hey. Hi. There you are.

22:01.863 --> 22:05.450
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Hello. Well, here I am.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.619
My mom is not bringing
the baby back until 9:00.

22:08.786 --> 22:12.040
So I was hoping you and I
could have a chance to kind of...

22:15.835 --> 22:18.588
- Somebody here?
- Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.

22:18.755 --> 22:21.924
- Who?
- Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.

22:23.468 --> 22:26.804
- You've been seeing someone?
- Yeah, didn't I mention that?

22:26.971 --> 22:29.891
I mean, we haven't been
going out too long...

22:30.058 --> 22:33.936
...but there's this amazing
connection between us.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.899
I mean, in fact just before you came in
she called me her boyfriend.

22:38.066 --> 22:42.111
I thought it was a little too soon,
but also, it felt kind of nice.

22:44.238 --> 22:48.076
What are you taking amoxicillin for?

22:53.289 --> 22:56.501
How great is this?
You're already comfortable enough...

22:56.667 --> 22:59.379
...to look through my stuff.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.006
I'm sorry, Michelle,
this is my roommate, Rachel.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.300
And I'm also Emma's mother.

23:05.051 --> 23:08.554
- Who's Emma?
- I told you about my daughter.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.182
This is your daughter?

23:12.100 --> 23:14.685
I could be your new mommy.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.781
And done.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.617
Oh, my God.

23:29.784 --> 23:32.870
I didn't feel a thing.
Hey, are you still looking for a job?

23:33.079 --> 23:36.624
Because you could tweeze circles
around that sadistic bitch at the salon.

23:38.042 --> 23:41.254
- Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?
- Yeah.

23:41.546 --> 23:42.713
Hey!

23:42.880 --> 23:46.175
They totally match. They look great.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.512
They look great. How you doing?

23:50.638 --> 23:53.975
Yeah, I think it looks pretty good.
I was a little worried I was...

23:54.142 --> 23:56.894
...uncovering a birthmark
right about there...

23:57.061 --> 24:00.148
...but it turned out to be
a little piece of chocolate.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.900
- Chandler, thank you so much.
- No problem.

24:03.067 --> 24:06.529
Listen, that was a pretty
girlie hour we just spent.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.157
We should do something manly
to make up for it.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.534
Yeah.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.165
- Curl my eyelashes.
- Yeah!

24:20.293 --> 24:25.214
For my next song, I think I'll sing
something a little more upbeat, all right?

24:25.381 --> 24:29.385
Oh, how about the Pointer Sisters'
"I'm So Excited"?

24:29.552 --> 24:31.888
And make it bouncy.

24:32.054 --> 24:35.016
Well, you can probably take care of that
on your end.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.937
I'm sorry I'm late. You'll understand
when you see Joey.

24:40.104 --> 24:43.691
Honey, you're just in time.
I'm about to sing another song.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.611
- Really? In front of all these people?
- And they love me.

24:46.777 --> 24:51.032
- Oh, my God.
- She gives the people what they want.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.743
All right, watch.

24:58.372 --> 25:02.710
Tonight, tonight we're gonna
Make it happen

25:02.919 --> 25:07.089
Tonight we'll put all other things aside

25:07.465 --> 25:10.593
Get in this time
And show me some affection

25:10.760 --> 25:13.888
Are those my wife's nipples?

25:14.222 --> 25:18.184
Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.
I wouldn't have let her go up again.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.644
I've got to stop this.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.313
Wrap myself around you...

25:26.859 --> 25:28.361
Yeah!

25:34.283 --> 25:37.119
Oh, who cares? They still love me.

25:40.331 --> 25:44.085
You, touching yourself! Out!

25:49.840 --> 25:51.968
Wow! She does that a lot.

25:53.511 --> 25:56.973
Ross, you didn't tell me
you were a doctor.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.309
Wait a minute. You haven't even
told her you are a doctor yet?

26:00.476 --> 26:02.436
How long have you known her,
like an hour?

26:02.645 --> 26:05.773
Actually, about an hour and a half.

26:05.940 --> 26:10.528
I told you it wasn't long, but there's
an amazing connection between us.

26:10.695 --> 26:13.030
You feel that too? Oh!

26:13.197 --> 26:17.910
- I thought that that was just me.
- Are you kidding?

26:18.077 --> 26:22.039
- Do you wanna go away this weekend?
- We'll see.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.625
Ross, what's going on here?

26:24.792 --> 26:27.753
Are we just bringing strange women
back to the apartment now?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.464
I don't know. Are we just kissing
guys on balconies?

26:31.007 --> 26:34.635
- How do you know about that?
- Through the magic of sight.

26:37.680 --> 26:42.018
- I was here, putting our child to sleep...
- Emma.

26:44.186 --> 26:47.189
When I looked through the window
and saw you kissing a guy...

26:47.356 --> 26:49.358
...you've known for what, a week?

26:49.525 --> 26:53.362
God, is that what this is all about?
You bring her up here to get back at me?

26:53.571 --> 26:57.074
No, actually, see, I had to pee
because I can't use public bathrooms...

26:57.241 --> 27:01.579
- ...because of the doody parasites.
- Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.

27:01.746 --> 27:04.498
- Well, call me.
- Okay.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.459
Wait, you don't have
my phone number.

27:06.667 --> 27:09.837
You know what?
If it's meant to be, I'll guess it.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.674
Bye-bye.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.344
Score.

27:16.510 --> 27:19.221
Did you not like her? Because I was
hoping we could come...

27:19.388 --> 27:21.432
...to your kissing parties
on the balcony.

27:21.641 --> 27:25.186
I can't believe you are making a big deal
about this. It was one kiss!

27:25.353 --> 27:27.980
- One guy. One time!
- Oh, really?

27:28.189 --> 27:30.816
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

27:32.526 --> 27:34.362
Oh, yeah.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.323
- What about the guy from the bar?
- Who?

27:37.531 --> 27:40.660
The guy you gave your number to.

27:40.826 --> 27:45.122
- How do you know about that?
- Because he called here looking for you.

27:45.289 --> 27:49.418
So don't tell me kissing this guy
from work is a one-time thing.

27:49.627 --> 27:52.922
Because you've been out there
in bars and on balconies...

27:53.089 --> 27:57.259
...for over a month now. And you
don't even have the courtesy to tell me.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.971
- Why didn't I get that message?
- What?

28:01.138 --> 28:04.934
From the guy in the bar?
Why didn't I get that message?

28:05.142 --> 28:08.312
Because I folded it up
and put it in my pants pocket.

28:08.479 --> 28:11.649
Do you...? Do you not look there?

28:13.609 --> 28:15.152
Ross.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.366
I never gave it to you.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.243
Why?

28:23.953 --> 28:26.622
- I don't know.
- Oh, God, you know what? I don't...

28:26.789 --> 28:29.542
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to decide...

28:29.709 --> 28:32.628
...what messages
I should or should not get?!

28:32.962 --> 28:35.756
Who am I? I'm the guy
who's taking care of our baby...

28:35.923 --> 28:39.218
- ...while you're at bars meeting guys!
- I cannot believe you.

28:39.385 --> 28:43.597
I actually came in here hoping to have
a mature conversation about us.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.350
But I can't do that with someone
who hides my messages...

28:46.517 --> 28:49.353
...and brings crazy women
back to my apartment!

28:49.562 --> 28:53.858
Hey, none of the sane ones
wanted to come back with me!

28:56.569 --> 28:59.572
That's not the point, okay?
The point is...

28:59.739 --> 29:03.784
...you are the one who moved on
and didn't tell anyone.

29:03.993 --> 29:08.122
Oh, God, Ross,
this is just so messed up.

29:08.289 --> 29:12.418
What is wrong with us? When people
hear about our situation, they ask:

29:12.626 --> 29:15.629
"You live together, but you're not
a couple, yet you have a baby?

29:15.796 --> 29:19.967
Isn't that weird?" And I say,
"No. It's not, because it works for us."

29:20.176 --> 29:22.094
But you know what?
This doesn't work.

29:22.261 --> 29:26.390
- In fact, this is the opposite of working.
- Clearly.

29:28.142 --> 29:29.852
And you know...

29:30.019 --> 29:33.731
...we said that we would live together
as long as this makes sense...

29:33.898 --> 29:38.277
...and maybe this
just doesn't make sense anymore.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.323
Yeah, maybe not.

29:43.574 --> 29:46.035
So, what do you wanna do?

29:49.205 --> 29:52.041
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:52.208 --> 29:55.669
Can Emma and I live here for a while?

29:55.878 --> 29:58.255
God. Uh...

29:58.964 --> 30:02.843
- Of course.
- Thank you.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.850
Your eyebrows look weird.

30:17.274 --> 30:21.362
Jeremiah was a bullfrog

30:21.570 --> 30:25.032
Was a good friend of mine

30:25.199 --> 30:28.452
Never understood a single word he said

30:28.661 --> 30:32.456
But I helped him drink his wine

30:35.376 --> 30:38.379
So you'll just touch yourself
for anything, then?
