00:00.520 --> 00:02.520
- <i>My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.520 --> 00:05.520
<i>and I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:07.520
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.520 --> 00:09.520
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge
to help struggling</i>

00:09.520 --> 00:12.520
<i>small business owners make it
in this competitive world.</i>

00:12.520 --> 00:14.520
<i>â™ª</i>

00:14.520 --> 00:18.520
<i>This is "Nathan for You."</i>

00:18.520 --> 00:21.520
<i>Alen Harikian is the owner
of Speers TV,</i>

00:21.520 --> 00:23.520
<i>a South-Pasadena
electronics store</i>

00:23.520 --> 00:25.120
<i>that's been operating
in the neighborhood</i>

00:25.140 --> 00:26.520
<i>for over 60 years.</i>

00:26.520 --> 00:28.520
<i>But ever since a massive
Best Buy moved in</i>

00:28.520 --> 00:30.520
<i>just minutes away
from his tiny shop,</i>

00:30.520 --> 00:32.520
<i>he's been finding it impossible</i>

00:32.520 --> 00:34.520
<i>to keep up with their
aggressive pricing.</i>

00:34.520 --> 00:36.520
- Their sales are ridiculous.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.520
I mean, there's no way
that I can compete.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.520
- <i>And if it keeps up,</i>

00:39.520 --> 00:42.520
<i>Speers TV is at risk
of going extinct.</i>

00:42.520 --> 00:44.520
<i>So I paid Alen a visit
with an ambitious solution</i>

00:44.520 --> 00:47.520
<i>to undercut
his biggest competitor.</i>

00:47.520 --> 00:49.640
Are you familiar with
the Best Buy price-match policy?

00:49.660 --> 00:51.520
- Yeah. It's horrible.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.520
I mean, it's bad
for small business.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.520
- <i>One of the main reasons</i>

00:55.540 --> 00:58.520
<i>Alen has such a hard time
competing with Best Buy</i>

00:58.520 --> 01:01.520
<i>is because of their aggressive
price-match policy,</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.520
<i>which guarantees
they will match the price</i>

01:03.520 --> 01:05.519
<i>of any local competitor,</i>

01:05.519 --> 01:07.600
<i>preventing stores like Speers
from underselling them,</i>

01:07.620 --> 01:09.520
<i>but if Alen
dropped his prices so low</i>

01:09.520 --> 01:12.520
<i>to make his TVs virtually free,</i>

01:12.520 --> 01:14.520
<i>according to Best Buy's
own policy,</i>

01:14.520 --> 01:16.120
<i>they would have to match
that price, too,</i>

01:16.140 --> 01:17.520
<i>giving Alen
a short window of time</i>

01:17.520 --> 01:20.520
<i>where he could buy up
all their inventory for $1</i>

01:20.520 --> 01:22.520
<i>and then resell those TVs
for any price he wants</i>

01:22.520 --> 01:25.520
<i>to make a huge profit.</i>

01:25.520 --> 01:28.520
<i>The plan: use Best Buy's
price-match policy against them</i>

01:28.520 --> 01:32.520
<i>to get Speers an endless supply
of $1 TVs.</i>

01:32.520 --> 01:33.520
- Um...

01:35.520 --> 01:37.520
It's a great idea.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.560
- It might take a little bit
of work and time to do.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.520
- Okay.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.520
- Do you have a lot
going on right now?

01:42.520 --> 01:45.520
- No, I honestly don't. No.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.520
- So you don't
have commitments at home

01:46.520 --> 01:47.520
or anything right now?

01:47.520 --> 01:49.520
Relationship stuff?

01:49.520 --> 01:50.800
- I'm not in a relationship, no.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.520
- I'm not in a relationship
either, so...

01:52.520 --> 01:53.520
- Oh.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.520
- We can both work on this,
you know, full-time.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.520
- Okay. All right. That's fine.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.520
- <i>After a bit more discussion,</i>

02:01.520 --> 02:04.520
<i>Alen was on board to move
forward with dropping the price</i>

02:04.520 --> 02:07.520
<i>on one of his premium
Samsung HD TV models</i>

02:07.520 --> 02:09.520
<i>to just $1 apiece,</i>

02:09.520 --> 02:12.520
<i>but once the new discounted
price went into effect,</i>

02:12.520 --> 02:14.520
<i>people would be flocking
to Speers to get the deal.</i>

02:14.540 --> 02:17.520
<i>So to help dissuade
these bargain hunters</i>

02:17.520 --> 02:19.520
<i>from buying up
all of Alen's dollar TVs,</i>

02:19.520 --> 02:22.520
<i>I implemented a strict
dress code, requiring customers</i>

02:22.520 --> 02:25.520
<i>to wear formal attire
just to enter the store.</i>

02:25.520 --> 02:27.520
<i>I then had all the dollar TVs
moved to an area</i>

02:27.520 --> 02:28.520
<i>at the back of the store</i>

02:28.520 --> 02:31.520
<i>and had a new wall constructed
to surround this area</i>

02:31.520 --> 02:32.560
<i>that could only be entered</i>

02:32.580 --> 02:35.520
<i>through a tiny,
two-foot-tall door.</i>

02:35.520 --> 02:38.520
<i>Finally, in between the door
and the TVs,</i>

02:38.520 --> 02:40.520
<i>I added a live alligator,</i>

02:40.520 --> 02:42.800
<i>which would hopefully force
customers who made it this far</i>

02:42.800 --> 02:43.920
<i>to reconsider their decision</i>

02:43.940 --> 02:47.510
<i>to take advantage
of the great offer.</i>

02:47.520 --> 02:49.520
<i>With our preventative measures
in place,</i>

02:49.520 --> 02:51.520
<i>I could now prepare
to get Alen his TVs.</i>

02:51.520 --> 02:53.520
<i>According to Best Buy's policy,</i>

02:53.520 --> 02:56.520
<i>price-matches are restricted
to one item per customer,</i>

02:56.520 --> 02:59.520
<i>so to maximize the number
of TVs I could get Alen,</i>

02:59.520 --> 03:02.520
<i>I put an ad on Craigslist
to recruit a team of people</i>

03:02.520 --> 03:04.520
<i>to help make the purchases,</i>

03:04.520 --> 03:06.520
<i>and later that week,
I met with those who responded</i>

03:06.540 --> 03:08.520
<i>to see if they
were right for the task.</i>

03:08.520 --> 03:12.520
So this job involves
buying things.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.520
- Okay.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.520
- Are you good at buying things?

03:16.520 --> 03:19.520
- Um, I would say so.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.520
Like, what do you mean
by buying things?

03:21.520 --> 03:24.520
- Like, going into a store
and buying something.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.520
- Yeah.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.520
- All right. Great.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.520
<i>All six applicants
seemed qualified for the job,</i>

03:30.520 --> 03:32.520
<i>so after printing out
some flyers</i>

03:32.520 --> 03:34.520
<i>and distributing them
throughout the neighborhood,</i>

03:34.520 --> 03:35.640
<i>it was finally time for Alen</i>

03:35.660 --> 03:39.520
<i>to offer his $1 prices
to the world.</i>

03:39.520 --> 03:41.520
<i>On the morning
of the big promotion,</i>

03:41.520 --> 03:44.520
<i>the deal vultures were already
circling out front,</i>

03:44.520 --> 03:46.520
<i>and that meant
we had to move quick,</i>

03:46.520 --> 03:48.520
<i>so I met my team of buyers
out back</i>

03:48.520 --> 03:52.520
<i>and gave them each the dollar
they'd need to buy the TVs</i>

03:52.520 --> 03:55.520
<i>and then sent them off in a van
to Best Buy.</i>

03:55.520 --> 03:57.560
<i>Meanwhile, I hung back
at Speers to help Alen ensure</i>

03:57.580 --> 03:59.520
<i>his inventory
remained untouched.</i>

03:59.520 --> 04:01.520
Hey.
- Hi.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.640
- You look good.
- Thank you.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.520
You too.
- Thanks.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.520
<i>And once Alen
unlocked the front door,</i>

04:06.520 --> 04:08.520
<i>we were officially
open for business.</i>

04:08.520 --> 04:10.520
- Wow, this is nice.
- Can I help you, or...

04:10.520 --> 04:11.520
- We're here to...

04:11.520 --> 04:13.520
for the TV deals.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.720
- Just so you guys know,
we do have a strict dress code,

04:15.740 --> 04:18.519
as you can see
on the wall, so...

04:18.519 --> 04:19.720
- Wow.
- There's no advertising

04:19.740 --> 04:21.519
about the dress code.
- Yeah.

04:21.519 --> 04:22.520
- Yeah.
- That's...

04:22.520 --> 04:24.520
- I mean, it's right
in the front of our store

04:24.520 --> 04:26.520
for everyone to see.
- <i>Yeah, but that doesn't...</i>

04:26.520 --> 04:27.880
- It's inside.
- This is the front.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.520
- It's inside.
We were waiting out there.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.520
We were waiting
in the front of the store.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.520
<i>- I knew some people
might be a bit frustrated,</i>

04:33.520 --> 04:34.520
<i>so I offered up a list</i>

04:34.520 --> 04:37.520
<i>of tuxedo rental stores
in the area</i>

04:37.520 --> 04:39.520
<i>to show them that Speers
did value their business.</i>

04:39.520 --> 04:41.120
Honestly, you seem like
very nice people,

04:41.140 --> 04:42.520
and I'd love to let you in,

04:42.520 --> 04:45.520
but I think doing so
would be unfair to the customers

04:45.520 --> 04:48.520
that, you know,
chose to dress... decent.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.520
- What the...

04:50.520 --> 04:52.520
- <i>My plan on the Speers TV side</i>
was working,

04:52.520 --> 04:54.520
<i>as 30 minutes after opening,</i>

04:54.520 --> 04:58.520
<i>exactly 0 of his $1
televisions had been purchased.</i>

04:58.520 --> 05:00.520
<i>Meanwhile, everything
was on track with my buyers</i>

05:00.520 --> 05:04.520
<i>as they were just now
arriving at Best Buy,</i>

05:04.520 --> 05:07.520
<i>but then, to my surprise,
a customer actually returned</i>

05:07.520 --> 05:09.520
<i>with attire that met
our strict dress code.</i>

05:09.520 --> 05:11.520
Did you rent that?
- Yes.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.520
<i>- I wasn't completely shocked
that someone</i>

05:13.520 --> 05:15.520
<i>would be determined enough
to make it inside,</i>

05:15.520 --> 05:17.520
<i>but I was hopeful
that the remaining steps</i>

05:17.520 --> 05:19.520
<i>would prove more discouraging.</i>

05:19.520 --> 05:23.520
So this is the section
with those TVs.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.520
- Okay.
- Um...

05:25.520 --> 05:27.520
- It's the premium-TV section.
- Yeah.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.640
<i>- That's the doorway?
- Yeah.</i>

05:28.640 --> 05:30.040
These are the more
expensive ones...

05:30.060 --> 05:31.510
- <i>Okay.</i>

05:31.520 --> 05:32.520
- So we keep them
in a separate room.

05:32.520 --> 05:33.720
That's gonna
be in there. Okay.

05:33.740 --> 05:34.740
- Yeah.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.520 --> 05:47.520
Oh. Okay.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.520
That's not good. Um...

05:54.520 --> 05:56.520
Yeah.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.080
<i>- The customer
may have been determined,</i>

05:58.100 --> 06:00.520
<i>but once he came face-to-face
with our alligator,</i>

06:00.520 --> 06:01.520
<i>it was all over.</i>

06:01.520 --> 06:03.520
I'm sorry.
I mean, I feel bad,

06:03.520 --> 06:05.640
'cause that's a dollar we're
losing as well, you know?

06:05.660 --> 06:07.520
<i>My plan was a success.</i>

06:07.520 --> 06:09.520
<i>The guy chose
not to buy the dollar TV,</i>

06:09.520 --> 06:11.520
<i>and every customer after
that met our dress code</i>

06:11.520 --> 06:14.520
<i>got no further than Herbert
as well.</i>

06:14.520 --> 06:16.520
- Herbert?
What is Herbert?

06:17.520 --> 06:19.520
- I'm sorry.
Did you not want a TV? Or...

06:19.520 --> 06:22.520
- No, I don't want to be in
the same room as an alligator.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.520
<i>- Everything seemed
to be going according to plan,</i>

06:24.520 --> 06:27.520
<i>but then I got word
that, back at Best Buy,</i>

06:27.520 --> 06:29.520
<i>things weren't looking so hot.</i>

06:29.520 --> 06:31.520
<i>After presenting the flyer
to sales associates,</i>

06:31.520 --> 06:32.520
<i>my buyers were told</i>

06:32.520 --> 06:34.520
<i>that the company would not
honor their price-match.</i>

06:37.520 --> 06:40.520
- This is a store,
and this is their price.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.520
<i>- I couldn't understand
why this was happening,</i>

06:44.520 --> 06:46.520
<i>so I left the shop
and headed over to Best Buy</i>

06:46.520 --> 06:49.520
<i>to see if I would have
any better luck myself.</i>

06:49.520 --> 06:52.520
I actually have a price-match
for this to get it for a dollar.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.520
- Why not?

06:57.520 --> 06:58.920
- They are.
They're within 25 miles.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.520
<i>- Even with my confidence
and negotiation skills,</i>

07:06.520 --> 07:08.520
<i>I was denied a price-match too.</i>

07:08.520 --> 07:10.520
I'm gonna count to three,

07:10.520 --> 07:12.520
and if you don't do it
by the time I get to three,

07:12.520 --> 07:13.520
I'm gonna leave, okay?

07:13.520 --> 07:16.520
One, two, three.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.520
- <i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

07:18.520 --> 07:20.520
<i>How could Best Buy,
one of my favorite companies,</i>

07:20.520 --> 07:22.520
<i>turn their backs
on the very policy</i>

07:22.520 --> 07:24.520
<i>that drew me in as a customer?</i>

07:24.520 --> 07:27.520
<i>It was a classic
bait-and-switch,</i>

07:27.520 --> 07:29.640
<i>but the one thing I knew
is that when big corporations</i>

07:29.660 --> 07:32.520
<i>try to mess
with regular people like us,</i>

07:32.520 --> 07:34.520
<i>we don't have
to take it lying down.</i>

07:34.520 --> 07:36.520
<i>So, the next day,
I returned to Alen's store</i>

07:36.520 --> 07:39.520
<i>with a slight adjustment
to our plan.</i>

07:39.520 --> 07:41.520
I'm just so sick and tired
of these big companies

07:41.520 --> 07:43.520
like Best Buy and Enron

07:43.520 --> 07:45.680
thinking that, you know,
the rules don't apply to them.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.520
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.520
- They can just push around
the little guy.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.520
You know what I mean?
- Yeah, absolutely.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.080
You're right.
- As far as I'm concerned,

07:52.100 --> 07:53.520
you're entitled to those TVs.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.520
- Yeah.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.520
- So that's why I've decided

07:57.520 --> 08:01.520
to file a class-action lawsuit
against Best Buy on your behalf.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.950
- In a way, it's
kind of nerve-racking,

08:06.950 --> 08:08.950
you know, like, going up
against a big company.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.110
- And how is that gonna work?

08:10.140 --> 08:12.960
What is the process?

08:12.950 --> 08:15.270
- You know, I don't know what
it will entail at this point,

08:15.300 --> 08:16.960
but we'll figure it out
together.

08:16.950 --> 08:18.150
You know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

08:18.180 --> 08:19.960
- We both aren't
in relationships.

08:19.950 --> 08:21.550
We don't have a love life.
- Yeah, but...

08:21.580 --> 08:22.960
That's true.

08:22.950 --> 08:24.950
- So you have time to do this?

08:24.950 --> 08:27.950
- Well, I mean, I...
this is my only li...

08:27.950 --> 08:29.950
basically, only way
of making money.

08:29.950 --> 08:32.030
So I wouldn't want to do
anything to jeopardize that.

08:32.059 --> 08:34.960
<i>- After telling Alen
I was gonna sue Best Buy,</i>

08:34.950 --> 08:36.110
<i>he was immediately concerned.</i>

08:36.110 --> 08:37.150
- They got bigger lawyers,

08:37.179 --> 08:38.960
better lawyers, probably,
more money.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.950
<i>- Alen was worried that Best Buy
would retaliate</i>

08:41.950 --> 08:43.950
<i>and have their lawyers
come after him.</i>

08:43.950 --> 08:44.950
So you're a bit worried?

08:44.950 --> 08:46.950
- Yeah.
Not a bit. A lot.

08:46.950 --> 08:47.950
- <i>I was torn.</i>

08:47.950 --> 08:49.030
<i>I couldn't live with myself</i>

08:49.060 --> 08:50.960
<i>if Alen ended up
broke and homeless</i>

08:50.950 --> 08:52.950
<i>because of my actions,</i>

08:52.950 --> 08:55.950
<i>but according to my research,
suing was the only way</i>

08:55.950 --> 08:57.950
<i>I could get him the TVs
he was rightfully owed,</i>

08:57.950 --> 09:00.950
<i>but that's when I came
across a sure-fire way</i>

09:00.950 --> 09:02.950
<i>to legally protect him
from Best Buy:</i>

09:02.950 --> 09:05.950
<i>a diagnosis of insanity.</i>

09:05.950 --> 09:08.950
<i>If Alen were diagnosed
as clinically insane,</i>

09:08.950 --> 09:11.190
<i>Best Buy wouldn't be able
to come after him for anything,</i>

09:11.220 --> 09:13.960
<i>but to do this
would take some maneuvering.</i>

09:13.950 --> 09:14.950
<i>So without telling Alen</i>

09:14.950 --> 09:16.950
<i>I was moving forward
with the lawsuit,</i>

09:16.950 --> 09:17.990
<i>I booked him an evaluation</i>

09:18.020 --> 09:20.960
<i>with L.A.-based
clinical psychologist</i>

09:20.950 --> 09:21.950
<i>Dr. Judy Rosenberg.</i>

09:21.950 --> 09:23.950
<i>I told Alen it was just
a routine checkup</i>

09:23.950 --> 09:26.950
<i>for insurance purposes
for the show,</i>

09:26.950 --> 09:28.190
<i>but I came prepared with a plan</i>

09:28.220 --> 09:30.960
<i>that would hopefully get me
the diagnosis I needed.</i>

09:30.950 --> 09:34.950
So I'm very concerned
about my friend Alen.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.950
- Mm-hmm.
- I believe he maybe

09:36.950 --> 09:38.950
has some sort of psychological
issue happening.

09:38.950 --> 09:41.950
- Okay. What are you noticing?

09:41.950 --> 09:44.190
- He believes he's the manager
of an electronics store...

09:44.220 --> 09:45.960
- Okay.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.950
- And has been working there
for the past 15 years.

09:47.980 --> 09:51.960
- Okay, so this
is a delusion that he's having.

09:51.950 --> 09:55.950
- I mean, as you'll see,
he has quite the imagination.

09:55.950 --> 09:57.950
- Okay.
- All right. You... you ready?

09:57.950 --> 09:59.270
- Let's go.
- Okay. It'll be easy.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.960
Just be yourself.
- All right. Okay.

10:00.950 --> 10:02.270
- It'll be
pretty straightforward.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.960
Yeah.
- Okay.

10:03.950 --> 10:06.950
- All right, so tell me
a little bit about yourself.

10:06.950 --> 10:08.950
- Well, I work at the Speers TV.

10:08.950 --> 10:10.950
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

10:10.950 --> 10:13.950
- I've been there for,
I would say, 15, 16 years, and...

10:13.950 --> 10:15.950
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

10:15.950 --> 10:17.230
And are you still working there?

10:17.230 --> 10:18.350
- Yes, I am. Yeah.
- <i>You are.</i>

10:18.380 --> 10:19.960
<i>Do you like?</i>
- I love it.

10:19.950 --> 10:20.950
- You love it. Okay.

10:20.950 --> 10:23.950
- Maybe ask about the alligator.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.950
- Okay.

10:26.950 --> 10:28.950
I didn't know. Go ahead.

10:28.950 --> 10:30.950
- Well, we did this thing where,

10:30.950 --> 10:33.950
you know, we put an alligator
inside a small door...

10:33.950 --> 10:35.950
or a smaller room, basically,
with a small door...

10:35.950 --> 10:36.950
- Mm-hmm.

10:36.950 --> 10:38.950
<i>- And we would have
customers coming in</i>

10:38.950 --> 10:39.990
to get a $1 TV, basically.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.960
- <i>Okay.</i>

10:41.950 --> 10:43.950
- So... and the only thing
they had to do was go...

10:43.950 --> 10:45.950
have, basically, a dress code.

10:45.950 --> 10:47.030
We had a dress code.
- Okay.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.960
- So you have to be
dressed nicely.

10:48.950 --> 10:49.950
Maybe a suit, you know.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.950
A tie. Nice shoes.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.950
- Wow. That is so interesting.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.950
- Yeah.

10:55.950 --> 10:57.950
It's interesting idea, and...

10:57.950 --> 10:59.510
- It is an interesting idea.
- <i>Yeah, so.</i>

10:59.540 --> 11:02.960
<i>- After Dr. Rosenberg
was done with her evaluation,</i>

11:02.950 --> 11:05.950
<i>I excused Alen from the room
so I could get her report.</i>

11:05.950 --> 11:06.990
What did you get from him?

11:07.020 --> 11:07.960
What sense...

11:07.950 --> 11:10.950
- He's not rooted in reality.

11:10.950 --> 11:12.150
You and I can sit here and go,

11:12.180 --> 11:13.960
"Wow. What a story."

11:13.950 --> 11:14.950
- Hmm.
- <i>"Jeez."</i>

11:14.950 --> 11:16.950
- Yeah.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.950
- I mean, read
the writing on the wall.

11:18.950 --> 11:20.950
Alligators, little doors...

11:20.950 --> 11:23.950
- Is this insanity
we're witnessing? Or...

11:23.950 --> 11:25.950
- I'm seeing psychosis.
Okay?

11:25.950 --> 11:28.950
I'm seeing delusional thinking.

11:28.950 --> 11:31.150
- Is there any way you could
put that in writing for me?

11:31.180 --> 11:32.960
- Sure.

11:32.950 --> 11:34.950
<i>- With proof
of Alen's insanity in hand,</i>

11:34.950 --> 11:36.390
<i>he was now immune
from prosecution...</i>

11:36.420 --> 11:37.960
Thank you so much.

11:37.950 --> 11:39.110
<i>And knowing he was protected,</i>

11:39.140 --> 11:41.960
<i>I was comfortable
moving forward with my lawsuit,</i>

11:41.950 --> 11:43.190
<i>but if I was gonna go up against</i>

11:43.220 --> 11:45.960
<i>a massive company like Best Buy,</i>

11:45.950 --> 11:47.950
<i>I would need some legal advice,</i>

11:47.950 --> 11:49.190
<i>so I paid a visit to my old pal,</i>

11:49.220 --> 11:50.960
<i>California judge Anthony Filosa,</i>

11:50.950 --> 11:53.950
<i>for guidance
on how to build my case.</i>

11:53.950 --> 11:56.950
- If you decide to sue Best Buy,

11:56.950 --> 11:58.190
based upon what you've told me,

11:58.220 --> 11:59.960
it's gonna be a huge battle.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.950
<i>- Filosa was skeptical
about my prospects,</i>

12:01.950 --> 12:03.950
<i>but he said
there was one piece of evidence</i>

12:03.950 --> 12:05.950
<i>that could turn the tide
to my favor.</i>

12:05.950 --> 12:09.950
- If you had an insider
from Best Buy that...

12:09.950 --> 12:13.950
that could testify
as to the price-match policy

12:13.950 --> 12:19.950
that they don't adhere to
across the board,

12:19.950 --> 12:20.950
that's relevant.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.230
- So I need info
from the inside.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.960
- Yes, whistleblower
for... type of person.

12:24.950 --> 12:26.950
<i>- It became clear
that without an inside source,</i>

12:26.950 --> 12:28.950
<i>I wouldn't have a case,</i>

12:28.950 --> 12:30.950
<i>but getting someone
from within these walls</i>

12:30.950 --> 12:33.950
<i>to disclose
corporate secrets on camera</i>

12:33.950 --> 12:35.950
<i>would be a whole other
challenge.</i>

12:35.950 --> 12:37.950
<i>So to conceal
my true intentions,</i>

12:37.950 --> 12:40.950
<i>I put up an ad
to recruit Best Buy employees</i>

12:40.950 --> 12:42.950
<i>for a new reality show
called "Retail Dating,"</i>

12:42.950 --> 12:46.950
<i>where people who work at retail
stores go on blind dates,</i>

12:46.950 --> 12:47.950
<i>and after a couple days,</i>

12:47.950 --> 12:51.950
<i>I got a response from a female
Best Buy employee named Elle.</i>

12:51.950 --> 12:52.950
- I'm 24 years old.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.950
I've worked at Best Buy
for three months.

12:54.950 --> 12:57.950
<i>- My plan was to pose
as another retail employee</i>

12:57.950 --> 12:59.950
<i>who was chosen to be her date,</i>

12:59.950 --> 13:02.070
<i>and because she mentioned
she liked alternative music,</i>

13:02.100 --> 13:04.960
<i>I decided to go as the manager
of a local Hot Topic</i>

13:04.950 --> 13:06.950
<i>named Nathan,</i>

13:06.950 --> 13:09.070
<i>but what Elle didn't know
is that my one and only goal</i>

13:09.100 --> 13:10.960
<i>was to get secret inside dirt</i>

13:10.950 --> 13:12.950
<i>on the Best Buy
price-match policy.</i>

13:12.950 --> 13:14.230
Do you want to see
a magic trick?

13:14.260 --> 13:15.960
- Oh, sure.
- Do you like magic?

13:15.950 --> 13:17.950
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:17.950 --> 13:19.110
- It's just a little...
- Yeah.

13:19.140 --> 13:20.960
- It's not...
- Why not?

13:20.950 --> 13:21.950
- Okay.

13:21.950 --> 13:22.950
See the coin?

13:22.950 --> 13:24.950
- I see it.
- Okay.

13:33.950 --> 13:35.230
- I think I've seen that before.

13:35.260 --> 13:36.960
- Okay.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.150
<i>Now that I had impressed Elle,</i>

13:38.180 --> 13:40.960
<i>it was time to see
if I could get her to admit</i>

13:40.950 --> 13:43.150
<i>that there was something more
going on with the Best Buy</i>

13:43.180 --> 13:44.960
<i>price-match policy
than meets the eye.</i>

13:44.950 --> 13:48.950
One cool thing about Hot Topic
is that, you know,

13:48.950 --> 13:50.950
they're pretty lax
on the rules, you know?

13:50.950 --> 13:52.950
We can kind of do
what we want a little bit.

13:52.950 --> 13:53.950
- Yeah.
- For example,

13:53.950 --> 13:56.950
we have this, uh,
price-match policy.

13:56.950 --> 13:58.950
Sometimes, like,
someone will come in

13:58.950 --> 14:00.150
with a legitimate price-match,

14:00.180 --> 14:02.960
and if I'm not feeling it,
I'll just be like, "No."

14:02.950 --> 14:03.950
You know what I mean?

14:03.950 --> 14:05.070
You guys ever do that? Or...

14:05.100 --> 14:07.960
- Oh, I've seen it happen, yes.
- At Best Buy?

14:07.950 --> 14:09.950
- Mm-hmm. Yes.
- You've seen what?

14:09.950 --> 14:12.950
- Other people not do it
because they're not...

14:12.950 --> 14:14.230
- Not do the price-match?
- Yeah.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.960
Because they're not
"feeling" the person.

14:15.950 --> 14:16.950
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

14:18.950 --> 14:19.950
- That's crazy.

14:19.950 --> 14:20.950
- Yeah.

14:20.950 --> 14:23.950
<i>- And there it was:
the smoking gun.</i>

14:23.950 --> 14:26.950
<i>On-camera evidence
of a culture of corruption,</i>

14:26.950 --> 14:28.950
<i>eroding the insides
of one of America's</i>

14:28.950 --> 14:31.950
<i>most-respected institutions.</i>

14:31.950 --> 14:33.350
<i>But even though I had
what I needed,</i>

14:33.350 --> 14:35.350
<i>I didn't want to be rude
and leave abruptly,</i>

14:35.350 --> 14:37.950
<i>so I decided to stay
for the private salsa lesson</i>

14:37.950 --> 14:39.950
<i>I had prearranged for the date.</i>

14:39.950 --> 14:41.950
How are you guys doing?

14:41.950 --> 14:43.950
You're supposed
to move your shoulders,

14:43.950 --> 14:45.950
your hips,
and your arms as well.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.950
- <i>I have to admit,</i>

14:47.950 --> 14:49.270
<i>I was a bit nervous
about dancing,</i>

14:49.300 --> 14:50.960
<i>but once we got going,</i>

14:50.950 --> 14:52.950
<i>I discovered I was actually
really good at it.</i>

14:52.950 --> 14:53.950
- Look at his eyes.

14:53.950 --> 14:54.950
He's waiting for you.

14:54.950 --> 14:56.950
<i>Perfect.</i>

14:56.950 --> 14:59.950
<i>- And once our date was over,
we said our good-byes.</i>

14:59.950 --> 15:00.950
- Nice meeting you.

15:00.950 --> 15:02.950
- Okay. Yeah. See you.

15:02.950 --> 15:03.950
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

15:07.180 --> 15:09.980
<i>- Now that I had
the evidence I needed</i>

15:09.980 --> 15:12.300
<i>against Best Buy, the potential
of an ugly courtroom battle</i>

15:12.330 --> 15:13.980
<i>was becoming a scary reality,</i>

15:13.980 --> 15:15.980
<i>and the only people
who could screw it up</i>

15:15.980 --> 15:17.020
<i>were my team of TV buyers,</i>

15:17.050 --> 15:19.980
<i>who would have to take the
stand if this went to trial.</i>

15:19.980 --> 15:21.980
<i>So I invited them
to a courtroom I rented</i>

15:21.980 --> 15:24.980
<i>to prepare each of them
for what they would face</i>

15:24.980 --> 15:27.980
<i>when they went head-to-head
with the Best Buy legal team.</i>

15:27.980 --> 15:29.180
Do you swear to tell the truth

15:29.180 --> 15:30.170
and the whole truth
and everything?

15:30.180 --> 15:30.970
- I do.
- Yes.

15:30.980 --> 15:31.980
- I do.

15:31.980 --> 15:33.980
- Yes.
- I do.

15:33.980 --> 15:35.980
- On the morning
of March 31, 2015,

15:35.980 --> 15:37.980
you entered a Best Buy,

15:37.980 --> 15:39.540
trying to price-match
a TV for a dollar.

15:39.570 --> 15:40.980
Is that correct?

15:40.980 --> 15:43.980
- It is, although I would have
to think of the exact date.

15:43.980 --> 15:45.980
- How did you find out
about that promotion?

15:47.980 --> 15:49.980
- From...

15:50.980 --> 15:51.980
Uh, a flyer.

15:51.980 --> 15:53.980
It was a flyer
that was in the...

15:53.980 --> 15:55.980
- <i>A flyer.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.980
- Did anyone tell you
to go to Best Buy that day?

15:59.980 --> 16:01.980
- Well, yes.

16:01.980 --> 16:04.980
I mean, no.

16:04.980 --> 16:06.980
No. I just wanted to go.

16:06.980 --> 16:10.980
- And was the television for
you, or was it for someone else?

16:10.980 --> 16:12.980
- It would've been for me.

16:12.980 --> 16:14.980
- <i>It was for you.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

16:14.980 --> 16:18.980
- Then how would you
explain this footage?

16:18.980 --> 16:21.980
<i>What you'll be doing
is going to Best Buy</i>

16:21.980 --> 16:24.980
<i>and using this flyer
to price-match</i>

16:24.980 --> 16:26.980
<i>and get a TV for a dollar...
- Okay.</i>

16:26.980 --> 16:29.180
<i>- And you'll bring that TV back
to me for me to keep it.</i>

16:29.210 --> 16:30.980
<i>It's not yours.
You understand, right?</i>

16:30.980 --> 16:31.980
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

16:31.980 --> 16:34.980
- How do you explain that?

16:34.980 --> 16:36.980
- Um...

16:41.980 --> 16:43.980
I...

16:43.980 --> 16:45.980
<i>- Right away, my buyer's
lack of confidence</i>

16:45.980 --> 16:47.980
<i>began to concern me,</i>

16:47.980 --> 16:49.980
<i>and as more and more
took the stand,</i>

16:49.980 --> 16:50.980
<i>it became clear
that they could be thrown off</i>

16:50.980 --> 16:52.980
<i>by even the simplest
of questions.</i>

16:52.980 --> 16:54.980
<i>Ms. Barcelona,</i>

16:54.980 --> 16:57.980
have you ever seen a man
that looks like this before?

17:01.980 --> 17:02.980
No.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.980
- <i>And for the first time,</i>

17:04.010 --> 17:05.980
<i>I began to have doubts
about our chances</i>

17:05.980 --> 17:07.980
<i>of winning this case.</i>

17:07.980 --> 17:08.980
<i>To make matters worse,</i>

17:08.980 --> 17:11.980
<i>when I showed Judge Filosa
the damning evidence</i>

17:11.980 --> 17:13.140
<i>I had obtained on Best Buy...</i>

17:13.170 --> 17:14.980
- A witness has to be in court,

17:14.980 --> 17:16.980
otherwise you can't introduce
their testimony,

17:16.980 --> 17:18.980
'cause they have to
cross-examine her.

17:18.980 --> 17:19.980
- But I have it on video.

17:19.980 --> 17:21.140
- No, that's not good enough.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.980
<i>- He told me that Elle's
statements</i>

17:22.980 --> 17:23.980
<i>would only be admissible</i>

17:23.980 --> 17:26.980
<i>if she agreed to say them
in an actual courtroom,</i>

17:26.980 --> 17:28.140
<i>but when I arranged a meet-up</i>

17:28.170 --> 17:30.980
<i>to ask her if she would be
willing to testify in person,</i>

17:30.980 --> 17:32.980
<i>she wasn't at all interested.</i>

17:32.980 --> 17:34.980
- That's really weird

17:34.980 --> 17:37.020
that you'd take someone
on a date and then ask them,

17:37.050 --> 17:41.050
"Hey, dude, like,
why don't we sue Best Buy?"

17:41.980 --> 17:43.980
- Okay.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.980
- For all I know, you're crazy.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.980
<i>- Elle didn't want
to help me out,</i>

17:48.980 --> 17:51.820
<i>and our case was crumbling
before my very eyes.</i>

17:53.110 --> 17:55.900
<i>- With Elle and her testimony
out of the picture,</i>

17:55.910 --> 17:57.900
<i>my case had taken a huge blow,</i>

17:57.910 --> 17:59.900
<i>but for some reason,
once she was gone,</i>

17:59.910 --> 18:01.900
<i>I just couldn't get her words
out of my head...</i>

18:01.910 --> 18:04.900
<i>For all I know, you're crazy.</i>

18:04.910 --> 18:05.910
- <i>And for the first time,</i>

18:05.940 --> 18:08.910
<i>I started to really think
about what I was doing.</i>

18:08.910 --> 18:10.030
<i>Here was a woman who thought</i>

18:10.060 --> 18:12.910
<i>she was sharing a genuine
connection with someone,</i>

18:12.910 --> 18:15.900
<i>but it was all just
a calculated ruse</i>

18:15.910 --> 18:18.900
<i>to get information,
a classic bait-and-switch,</i>

18:18.910 --> 18:21.900
<i>and in that moment,
I realized I'd become</i>

18:21.910 --> 18:24.900
<i>no better than the corporation
I was trying to defeat,</i>

18:24.910 --> 18:26.900
<i>that in my efforts
to take down Best Buy,</i>

18:26.910 --> 18:29.900
<i>I became the worst guy.</i>

18:29.910 --> 18:31.900
<i>I could've kept pursuing
this lawsuit</i>

18:31.910 --> 18:33.910
<i>and tried again to get
the court testimony I needed</i>

18:33.940 --> 18:35.910
<i>from another Best Buy employee</i>

18:35.910 --> 18:37.900
<i>that submitted to my
"Retail Dating" show...</i>

18:37.910 --> 18:39.390
- You know, when you work
at Best Buy,

18:39.420 --> 18:40.910
you're, like,
in a tech playground

18:40.910 --> 18:42.900
with, like, CDs and DVDs.

18:42.910 --> 18:45.900
<i>- But I didn't want to break
the heart of another angel</i>

18:45.910 --> 18:47.900
<i>who was just searching
for a real connection...</i>

18:47.910 --> 18:50.150
- Admittedly, it's been awhile
since I've been on a date.

18:50.180 --> 18:51.910
- <i>So I decided to drop my case</i>

18:51.910 --> 18:54.900
<i>and give up
on getting Alen his TVs.</i>

18:54.910 --> 18:57.900
<i>When you define yourself
entirely by your successes,</i>

18:57.910 --> 19:00.900
<i>failure can leave you feeling
pretty empty inside,</i>

19:00.910 --> 19:03.900
<i>but when I was reviewing
the footage we shot,</i>

19:03.910 --> 19:05.900
<i>I stumbled upon
a conversation I had with Alen</i>

19:05.910 --> 19:07.900
<i>on the day of his big promotion.</i>

19:07.910 --> 19:09.900
<i>- She says like, "You know,
you should, you know,</i>

19:09.910 --> 19:11.670
<i>find someone and get married,
so... have kids."</i>

19:11.700 --> 19:12.910
<i>- Your mom?
- Yeah. So.</i>

19:12.910 --> 19:15.900
<i>- And it made me realize
that my definition of success</i>

19:15.910 --> 19:17.900
<i>might've been entirely wrong.</i>

19:17.910 --> 19:18.900
<i>Getting close, or...</i>

19:18.910 --> 19:20.900
<i>- No. No.
- No.</i>

19:20.910 --> 19:22.900
<i>- Just concentrating
on the job, so.</i>

19:22.910 --> 19:23.900
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

19:23.910 --> 19:24.910
- <i>I didn't see it before,</i>

19:24.940 --> 19:27.910
<i>but the truth
was all over his face.</i>

19:27.910 --> 19:30.900
<i>Alen might've said he wanted
some TVs at a discounted price,</i>

19:30.910 --> 19:32.900
<i>but it wasn't what he needed.</i>

19:32.910 --> 19:34.900
<i>So, the next day,
I returned to Speers</i>

19:34.910 --> 19:36.900
<i>with the one thing
he'd been denying himself</i>

19:36.910 --> 19:38.900
<i>for so many years.</i>

19:38.910 --> 19:41.900
So I know I couldn't get you
those TVs that I promised...

19:41.910 --> 19:43.900
- It's okay.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.950
- But there is someone
I'd like to introduce you to.

19:45.980 --> 19:46.910
- Okay.
- Is that okay?

19:46.910 --> 19:47.950
- Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.910
- Okay. One sec.
- <i>Okay.</i>

19:49.910 --> 19:50.910
- Thanks.

19:52.910 --> 19:53.900
- Hi.

19:53.910 --> 19:55.900
- Alen, this is Cathy.

19:55.910 --> 19:58.030
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Cathy. Nice to meet you.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.910
- Cathy used to work
at Best Buy...

20:00.910 --> 20:01.900
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.900
- And she also
happens to be single.

20:04.910 --> 20:06.070
- <i>Mm-hmm. That's right.</i>
- Oh.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.910
- So I'll let you two
get to know each other.

20:07.910 --> 20:08.900
- All right. Okay.
- Awesome. Thank you.

20:08.910 --> 20:09.900
- Hi. So.
- Hi.

20:09.910 --> 20:11.900
- Hi. So.

20:11.910 --> 20:12.900
- <i>How are you doing?</i>
- Everything's good.

20:12.910 --> 20:13.900
Yeah. So.
- Good.

20:13.910 --> 20:15.900
- Yeah.
So you worked at Best Buy, huh?

20:15.910 --> 20:17.900
- Yeah, I worked at Best Buy
in high school.

20:17.910 --> 20:18.900
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.900
- Okay. Which location?
Was it around?

20:20.910 --> 20:21.900
- <i>Seeing Alen light up</i>

20:21.910 --> 20:23.900
<i>made me feel great
about what I had done.</i>

20:23.910 --> 20:25.900
- The crazy thing is, like,
once it starts raining

20:25.910 --> 20:27.900
for a few days,
everybody's panicking.

20:27.910 --> 20:28.900
- Oh, yeah.
Then they freak out. Yeah.

20:28.910 --> 20:30.900
- They're like, "Oh, my God,
we need the sun.

20:30.910 --> 20:33.110
It's California. What the hell?"
Like, they can't do it.

20:33.140 --> 20:34.910
<i>- As for me,
I was fine being alone</i>

20:34.910 --> 20:37.900
<i>because it would give me
more time to focus on my work.</i>

20:37.910 --> 20:41.900
<i>â™ª</i>

20:41.910 --> 20:43.900
- So 773 is a Chicago
area code...

20:43.910 --> 20:44.900
- Okay. All right.
- But it's my cell phone.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.900
- It was good to meet you.
- Good to meet you too.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.900
Thank you so much.
- All right. Bye.

20:48.910 --> 20:51.270
I'll see you soon, hopefully.
I'll give you a call for sure.

20:51.270 --> 20:52.910
- Okay. Bye. Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay. Bye.

20:52.940 --> 20:56.580
<i>â™ª</i>

21:00.890 --> 21:03.190
- You have the Hot Topic look.
- Oh, yeah.

21:03.190 --> 21:05.190
Well, employee discount,
you know...

21:05.190 --> 21:06.710
- How much discount
do you get, anyway?

21:06.730 --> 21:07.180
- 40%.

21:07.190 --> 21:09.190
- Oh, my God.

21:09.190 --> 21:10.470
Wow.
- <i>That's pretty good, right?</i>

21:10.490 --> 21:11.180
- That's amazing.

21:11.190 --> 21:12.390
- What do you get at Best Buy?

21:12.410 --> 21:14.410
- I think it was 40% off.
