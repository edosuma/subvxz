00:00.967 --> 00:02.503
BOBBY: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.536 --> 00:06.072
We find the defendant
William Hinks not guilty.

00:06.106 --> 00:09.142
Lindsay, the man
did not kill anybody.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.310
Jeannie, he did.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.545
WILLIAM: Can I vote?

00:11.578 --> 00:13.279
LINDSAY: Since you are
treating him,

00:13.313 --> 00:14.715
I would just like you
to prevail upon him

00:14.748 --> 00:16.349
not to stalk me
anymore.

00:16.382 --> 00:18.318
I can't promise
I'll be effective,

00:18.351 --> 00:20.253
but I'll certainly try.

00:20.286 --> 00:22.122
I am issuing
a restraining order

00:22.155 --> 00:25.391
requiring Mr. Hinks
not to contact, follow,

00:25.425 --> 00:27.828
or approach Ms. Dole
and Ms. Hatcher

00:27.861 --> 00:31.231
and to stay at least
1,000 feet from them,

00:31.264 --> 00:33.366
their homes,
and their offices.

00:37.403 --> 00:38.805
BOBBY:
You told the police

00:38.839 --> 00:40.741
that Scott Wallace
acted with premeditation?

00:40.774 --> 00:42.175
-He did.
-You're his lawyer.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.409
Not on this, I'm not.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.245
Ellenor and I
were witnesses.

00:45.278 --> 00:46.446
And Ellenor
correctly said he snapped.

00:46.479 --> 00:47.581
I don't agree.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.182
Well, if you're wrong, Jimmy,

00:49.215 --> 00:51.317
your mistake could cost
a man a life sentence.

00:51.351 --> 00:54.220
We all think it would be best
not to represent Scott Wallace.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.356
-Forget it.
-We should vote, Bobby.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.425
All those in favor
of me representing him...

00:59.459 --> 01:00.761
all opposed...

01:02.529 --> 01:04.297
The ayes have it.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.377
You're going up first.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.580
You also might be
batting cleanup.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.847
Okay.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.584
I'll basically just be
asking you what you saw.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.318
Contrary
to popular belief,

01:25.351 --> 01:27.621
I do not supply the answers
of my witnesses.

01:27.654 --> 01:31.124
This is
a little delicate, but...

01:31.157 --> 01:34.795
you do realize the lawyer
who will cross-examine you

01:34.828 --> 01:36.697
will try to leave you
in the shape of a pretzel.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.765
How long do you figure
to keep me up there?

01:38.799 --> 01:42.335
It should be
pretty short.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.337
I'm assuming
you have no conflict,

01:44.370 --> 01:46.840
and you'll continue
to give a truthful account.

01:46.873 --> 01:48.675
Of course
I have a conflict.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.577
My boss
is opposing counsel.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.846
I'll be testifying
against a former client.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.315
In my life,
I'll probably never know

01:55.348 --> 01:56.683
a bigger
professional conflict.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.585
But you're prepared
to tell the truth.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.786
That's why I'm here.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.387
Okay.

02:01.421 --> 02:04.691
Once again,
you might know Bobby Donnell,

02:04.725 --> 02:05.726
you might be friends
with him,

02:05.759 --> 02:07.561
but being cross-examined
by him

02:07.594 --> 02:09.663
is a different experience,
one you might not be --

02:09.696 --> 02:12.633
Richard,
I can handle Bobby.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.577
Bobby.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.845
Forget it.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.247
It's too late now, anyway.
We start tomorrow.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.249
Let me do it, then.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.684
Eugene, the only reason
the judge signed off

02:30.717 --> 02:32.619
on the conflict is because
of the unique trust

02:32.653 --> 02:34.320
that Scott shares with me.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.622
This firm.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.858
No, me.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.894
This could splinter us.
Jimmy, Ellenor --

02:40.927 --> 02:42.529
We've been through it.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.964
Well, for Scott Wallace's
sake, then.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.398
You've been erratic.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.634
I'm your friend, Bobby.
I'm your partner.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.536
Trust me
when I tell you

02:49.570 --> 02:52.372
you're in no emotional shape
to be trying this case.

02:52.405 --> 02:56.209
I am trying this case.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.579
End of discussion,
Eugene.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.551
â™ª (theme)

03:50.363 --> 03:52.398
The decision to even allow
Bobby Donnell

03:52.432 --> 03:55.335
to represent Scott Wallace
in this case

03:55.368 --> 03:56.937
has drawn
considerable fire

03:56.970 --> 03:59.940
from judges, prosecutors,
and defense lawyers alike.

03:59.973 --> 04:03.009
MAN: There is insanity here.
It comes from Mr. Donnell

04:03.043 --> 04:04.678
and Judge Michaelson.

04:04.711 --> 04:07.013
The idea that a lawyer
acts as defense counsel

04:07.047 --> 04:09.650
where two lawyers
from his own firm

04:09.683 --> 04:12.919
are primary witnesses?
It's ludicrous.

04:12.953 --> 04:16.022
Did Bec call?

04:16.055 --> 04:17.658
Yeah.

04:17.690 --> 04:21.027
She just left the clerk.
You're on time.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.329
(door opens)

04:23.363 --> 04:26.432
All set?

04:27.734 --> 04:29.970
What, we shouldn't
go over together

04:30.003 --> 04:31.638
'cause we're
on opposite sides?

04:31.672 --> 04:34.941
Jimmy, you've got to promise
no hard feelings.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.710
How many times
are you going to say that?

04:36.743 --> 04:38.945
Well, I will
have to go after you.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.080
I understand that, Bobby.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.715
And I'll get you.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.717
I'll embarrass you.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.451
Do you understand that?

04:45.485 --> 04:47.621
What's this, one of your
intimidation tricks?

04:47.654 --> 04:48.855
I'm not trying
to intimidate.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.456
I just don't
want this trial

04:50.490 --> 04:52.058
to jeopardize
our friendship.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.528
Bobby, if you gave a rat's ass
about our friendship,

04:54.561 --> 04:55.996
you wouldn't be
on this case.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.831
All right.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.833
No, let's all be honest.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.802
My involvement here
is mandatory,

05:01.835 --> 05:04.104
just like Ellenor's.
We're material witnesses.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.072
The only one
with a choice is you.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.708
I didn't choose.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.543
Scott Wallace isn't
in a psychological place...

05:09.576 --> 05:10.977
Can't trust anybody
but you, yeah, yeah.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.445
Look at you guys.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.647
You're already
at each other's throats.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.715
I'm not
at anybody's throat.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.382
I'm just saying, Jimmy,

05:16.416 --> 05:18.451
what I do in that room
is purely professional,

05:18.484 --> 05:20.086
so please don't
take it personally.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.121
(telephone rings)

05:21.154 --> 05:24.925
Donnell, Young, and Dole.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.092
When?

05:26.126 --> 05:30.396
Well, is she okay?

05:30.430 --> 05:32.498
Yeah, I'll --
I'll let her know.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.035
Thank you.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.604
Jeannie Reynolds
had a heart attack.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.607
What?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.609
She's in the E.R.
at Mass. General.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.382
I'll go with her.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.753
WOMAN (on P. A.):
Dr. Hoffman
to Medical Records.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.856
Dr. Hoffman to
Medical Records.

05:55.889 --> 05:56.857
Lindsay.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.859
Is she okay?

05:58.892 --> 06:00.694
They don't know yet.

06:00.727 --> 06:03.897
Lucy Hatcher, this is
Jeannie's mother Marianne.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.967
She was supposed to drive me
to the airport this morning,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.434
and she didn't show.

06:08.468 --> 06:09.903
I couldn't get her
by phone,

06:09.936 --> 06:11.738
so I went over
to her apartment.

06:11.772 --> 06:15.609
She was just lying on the bed,
and she wasn't breathing.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.043
Did they get a pulse?

06:17.077 --> 06:20.146
The paramedics --
I think they got something.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.149
Yeah. I don't even know
how long she was lying there.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.451
Had she had
any heart problems?

06:25.485 --> 06:28.622
No. She's in her 30s,
for God's sake.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.625
What 30-year-old
has a heart attack?

06:41.602 --> 06:45.572
We were trying one last time
to negotiate a settlement.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.575
Mr. Duvall was also a friend
of Scott Wallace,

06:48.609 --> 06:52.112
so we figured
it was worth a try.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.847
Can you describe
what transpired

06:53.880 --> 06:55.749
at the meeting,
Mr. Berluti?

06:55.782 --> 06:58.819
Well, Mr. Duvall told Scott
he would not rehire him,

06:58.852 --> 07:01.187
and Scott
began to get upset.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.024
He felt particularly
betrayed by Mr. Duvall

07:04.057 --> 07:06.492
since they were friends.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.929
Scott -- he claimed
his life was ruined,

07:08.962 --> 07:12.032
and that Mr. Duvall was
the first to abandon him.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.667
Then, suddenly,

07:13.700 --> 07:15.602
he's pulled a gun,
and he looks for a second

07:15.636 --> 07:17.604
like he's going
to kill himself.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.773
He even pointed
the gun at himself.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.041
And then what happened?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.043
Well, Mr. Duvall
started to try

07:23.076 --> 07:25.045
to talk him out of it.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.047
He said
suicide wasn't the answer.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.616
And Scott,
he said something like...

07:29.650 --> 07:31.752
"You're right,"
and he turned the gun,

07:31.785 --> 07:34.888
and he pointed it
right at Mr. Duvall.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.156
Could you describe

07:36.189 --> 07:38.058
Mr. Wallace's demeanor
at this point?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.527
Well, he was angry.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.228
That was the thing.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.064
He wasn't, like,
in despair.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.532
Objection -- foundation.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.533
Overruled.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.602
Go ahead, sir.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.604
He also --
he wasn't talking crazy.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.273
He was actually giving
these clever little answers.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.241
What do you mean?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.243
Well, when he had
the gun on himself,

07:57.277 --> 07:58.612
Mr. Duvall said --

07:58.645 --> 07:59.613
Hearsay.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.747
Overruled.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.816
He said,
"Suicide's not the answer,"

08:02.849 --> 08:04.985
and Scott, he said,

08:05.018 --> 08:06.987
"How would you know, Harry?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.989
"The last time
you killed yourself,

08:09.022 --> 08:10.624
it didn't work out?"

08:10.657 --> 08:12.993
and then
after he shot him,

08:13.026 --> 08:15.996
he turned to Ellenor Frutt
and me all calm,

08:16.029 --> 08:20.000
and he said, "Bet you're glad
I ran out of bullets, huh?"

08:20.033 --> 08:22.669
From your observation,

08:22.703 --> 08:25.205
was this man acting
in conscious control --

08:25.238 --> 08:26.840
BOBBY: Objection.
Foundation.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.274
I'm asking
the lay opinion

08:28.308 --> 08:30.010
of somebody
who was in the room.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.812
I'll allow it.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.014
When he fired that gun

08:34.047 --> 08:36.282
and killed Harry Duvall,

08:36.316 --> 08:38.952
did he appear to be
in control of himself?

08:38.985 --> 08:40.953
In my lay opinion,

08:40.986 --> 08:43.323
this was not
a man who snapped.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.959
I think he only pointed
the gun at himself

08:45.992 --> 08:48.962
to make it seem like
he was out of control.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.965
But when he shot
Harry Duvall,

08:51.998 --> 08:57.971
to me, it looked like
an ice cold execution.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.622
Ms. Reynolds?

09:15.656 --> 09:18.992
I'm sorry. The coronary
was just too massive.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.627
Oh, God.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.596
Please, God, no.

09:24.030 --> 09:27.067
She died of -- you're sure
it was a coronary?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.869
Yes.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.055
You don't have
any psychiatric training,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.356
do you, Jimmy?

09:50.390 --> 09:54.194
No, I do not. I said
it was in my lay opinion.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.196
What was
going through your head

09:56.229 --> 09:58.699
when Mr. Wallace
first pulled out that gun?

09:58.732 --> 10:00.300
At first when he put
the gun to his head,

10:00.333 --> 10:02.068
I thought he was going
to kill himself.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.670
Did you try to stop him?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.071
Did I try to stop him?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.207
Yes. Did you do anything?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.975
No. I think
I kind of froze.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.343
You froze.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.078
Did you say anything?

10:12.112 --> 10:15.816
I don't really remember
if I said anything or not.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.250
You don't really remember.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.052
You remember things
Mr. Wallace said,

10:19.085 --> 10:20.353
but you don't remember
what you said.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.155
I don't remember
saying anything.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.957
Does that mean
you didn't say anything,

10:23.990 --> 10:25.158
or if you did,
you just don't remember?

10:25.191 --> 10:27.227
I didn't say anything.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.362
Why not?
Your own client

10:29.395 --> 10:31.732
was apparently
about to take his life.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.700
You didn't even try
to dissuade him?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.869
I think I was
a little in --

10:35.902 --> 10:37.237
I was surprised.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.105
You were about to say
you were in shock,

10:39.139 --> 10:40.106
weren't you?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.742
I wasn't in shock.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.176
I was caught by surprise.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.078
Why didn't you
do anything, Jimmy?

10:45.111 --> 10:46.913
You could have
said something.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.082
You could have tried
to restrain Mr. Wallace.

10:49.115 --> 10:52.719
You could have left the room.
Instead, you did nothing.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.721
The man had a gun.
I wasn't going to rush him.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.289
Why, were you in fear
for your own life?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.724
A little, sure.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.025
So you were in fear when
all this happened?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.293
Yes.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.962
Ever been shot
yourself, Jimmy?

11:05.331 --> 11:06.733
Yes.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.068
Objection. Relevance?

11:08.101 --> 11:10.136
I'm attempting to show
this witness was in shock.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.872
He had previously been
a shooting victim himself.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.774
When he saw the gun --

11:13.807 --> 11:15.041
Now he's testifying.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.476
That objection is sustained.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.411
The first one is overruled.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.846
Where were you shot, Jimmy?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.414
My midsection.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.016
You almost died,
didn't you?

11:23.049 --> 11:23.917
That had nothing to do--

11:23.950 --> 11:26.086
You almost died.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.253
Yes.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.389
In fact,
you still have nightmares

11:29.422 --> 11:31.324
over being shot, don't you?

11:31.357 --> 11:32.793
Yes.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.728
-Ever sought therapy for that?
-No.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.229
Ever talk
about your nightmares

11:36.262 --> 11:37.330
with family
or close friends?

11:37.363 --> 11:38.999
No.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.734
You get shot.
You almost die.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.268
You have
reoccurring dreams.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.904
You don't talk about it
with anybody?

11:43.937 --> 11:45.071
-No.
-Why not?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.339
There's no need to.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.408
It's something
I can deal with myself.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.176
It's something
you can deal with yourself.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.012
And if somebody were
to pull out a gun

11:52.045 --> 11:53.446
in front of you today,

11:53.479 --> 11:55.281
you don't think
your powers of observation

11:55.315 --> 11:56.917
would be
at all compromised

11:56.950 --> 11:58.351
by your own
personal history?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.086
No, I do not.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.288
When somebody goes to kill
themselves or somebody else,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.190
it's your normal
clear-headed reaction

12:04.224 --> 12:06.059
to neither do anything
nor say anything?

12:06.092 --> 12:10.463
It's how I reacted
in this situation, yes.

12:10.496 --> 12:11.965
And tell me, Jimmy,
since all this happened,

12:11.998 --> 12:13.767
do you have nightmares
thinking maybe

12:13.800 --> 12:16.169
if you had done something
or said something,

12:16.202 --> 12:18.371
Harry Duvall
might still be alive?

12:18.404 --> 12:21.307
Have you been haunted
at all by that, Jimmy?

12:21.341 --> 12:22.442
No.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.277
Gee, to let another man
be killed --

12:24.310 --> 12:25.546
Objection.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.447
You were in shock,
weren't you, Jimmy?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.550
No, I was not.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.451
No? And it really
doesn't bother you

12:31.484 --> 12:33.353
that you didn't
do anything?

12:33.386 --> 12:34.387
Objection.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.256
Withdrawn.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.928
Nothing further.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.247
It was not
a heart attack.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.382
Lindsay...

13:02.415 --> 13:04.050
I don't care
what the doctor said.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.986
A woman in her 30s doesn't
just suddenly turn up dead.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.453
It was William Hinks.
I know it.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.222
What, he scared her
into having a coronary?

13:09.255 --> 13:11.024
Did you check for toxins?
If she was poisoned --

13:11.057 --> 13:12.392
-Lindsay--
-At least order an autopsy.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.127
The mother
is resisting that.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.562
Without some evidence
of foul play --

13:15.596 --> 13:17.363
Michael, she was treating
a serial killer.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.265
This wouldn't fit
his pattern.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.401
I know, but don't you think
it's a bit of a coincidence?

13:21.434 --> 13:22.569
Lindsay --

13:22.603 --> 13:25.572
I know he did it.
He killed her.

13:25.606 --> 13:28.374
I'll tell you what.
We'll dust her apartment,

13:28.408 --> 13:31.011
search it as if it were
a crime scene.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.846
What about the autopsy?

13:32.879 --> 13:36.016
You'll have to get the family
to agree to that.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.018
(sighs)

13:38.051 --> 13:40.554
I completely disagree
with Mr. Berluti's account.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.188
BOBBY: How so?

13:42.222 --> 13:44.024
Well, from my observation,

13:44.057 --> 13:46.627
Scott Wallace
was extremely erratic.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.629
Though I am
no psychologist,

13:48.662 --> 13:51.197
I believe he was going
to take his own life,

13:51.231 --> 13:53.600
and then he suddenly
turned the gun on Mr. Duvall.

13:53.634 --> 13:56.336
Could you describe
his behavior physically?

13:56.369 --> 13:59.640
Yes. He was trembling,
shaking,

13:59.673 --> 14:01.207
his eyes were closed

14:01.241 --> 14:02.976
when he had the gun
up to his own head,

14:03.009 --> 14:04.945
and then he started
to rock up and down slightly

14:04.978 --> 14:06.379
on the balls
of his feet.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.981
What did you do
at this point?

14:08.014 --> 14:10.250
Well, I tried to stop him,
reason with him,

14:10.283 --> 14:12.953
but he just screamed at me
and told me to shut up.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.955
I mean,
he screamed it at me,

14:14.988 --> 14:16.256
like he was
some kind of a madman.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.492
And when he turned the gun
on Mr. Duvall?

14:19.526 --> 14:23.129
His eyes had
this blank, foreign look.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.497
I think, mentally,

14:24.531 --> 14:27.233
he was gone
at that point.

14:27.267 --> 14:31.104
Ellenor, what about
Jimmy Berluti's behavior?

14:31.137 --> 14:33.139
That seemed
very odd as well.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.140
How so?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.408
He just sat there.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.410
When Scott
pulled out the gun,

14:37.443 --> 14:39.980
we all jumped up
except for Jimmy.

14:40.013 --> 14:44.518
He just sat there frozen,
like he was catatonic.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.621
I think
he went into shock.

14:47.654 --> 14:51.091
"Erratic," "madman,"
"catatonic," "shock" --

14:51.124 --> 14:53.426
A lot
of clinical buzzwords.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.529
I said
I was no psychologist.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.164
I testified
as to what I saw.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.333
In addition
to being a witness,

15:00.366 --> 15:01.702
Scott Wallace
is also your client.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.637
Former client.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.706
Well, he continues to be
a client of your firm.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.542
It doesn't compromise
the truth of my testimony.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.143
Could you respond
to my question?

15:10.176 --> 15:12.145
I am responding to
your implication.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.580
Yes or no.

15:13.614 --> 15:16.149
Scott Wallace is a client
of your law firm.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.383
Yes.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.452
And you, personally,
have been his lawyer.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.087
Yes.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.388
And Bobby Donnell

15:22.422 --> 15:24.457
is the senior partner
of your law firm.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.259
Yes.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.630
An autopsy?

15:29.663 --> 15:31.665
This man is ingenious.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.299
I just can't
rule out the idea

15:33.333 --> 15:35.101
that, somehow,
he's involved.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.137
Wouldn't the doctors
have been able to tell that?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.640
Yes, with an autopsy.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.108
On the face of it,

15:42.142 --> 15:44.244
there doesn't seem to be
any foul play, but I just --

15:44.277 --> 15:47.981
The idea
of cutting her up...

15:48.014 --> 15:50.383
This man is meticulous.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.985
(sighs)

15:52.018 --> 15:54.555
If she was killed,

15:54.588 --> 15:57.691
there isn't likely to be
any evidence at her home.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.326
Mrs. Reynolds,
even with just the possibility
that she was killed --

16:00.360 --> 16:01.595
You're the only one

16:01.628 --> 16:03.730
suggesting the possibility
she was killed.

16:03.764 --> 16:08.034
An autopsy could be done
in a day, maybe two.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.040
I just have
a strong feeling that --

16:43.336 --> 16:44.805
Certainly
you can't expect

16:44.838 --> 16:48.308
that restraining order
to apply here.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.744
I heard that Dr. Reynolds
had a medical emergency,

16:50.777 --> 16:53.313
I came down.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.116
I had no way of knowing
you'd be present.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.586
Did you kill her?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.557
That hurt my feelings.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.458
Did you kill her?

17:05.491 --> 17:07.828
In that you ask me
such a question

17:07.861 --> 17:09.462
within earshot of others,

17:09.494 --> 17:11.732
I have a cause of action
for slander.

17:11.765 --> 17:14.400
Why don't you sue me?

17:14.434 --> 17:17.403
What a delightful idea.

17:17.436 --> 17:20.440
Be tough to enforce
that restraining order then,

17:20.473 --> 17:23.143
wouldn't it, with us
inextricably embroiled

17:23.175 --> 17:25.345
in a lawsuit together?

17:28.281 --> 17:30.216
By the way...

17:30.250 --> 17:32.753
I don't poison.

17:32.786 --> 17:35.455
I cut off heads.

17:45.298 --> 17:49.369
That's the man
I think killed your daughter.

17:49.402 --> 17:54.140
Please request the autopsy.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.548
EUGENE: How's he doing?

18:01.582 --> 18:04.117
Actually, I thought
he was pretty great.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.286
In control.
He had Jimmy for lunch.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.554
What?

18:07.588 --> 18:09.823
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.725
He didn't
have me for lunch.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.894
I-I'm just trying to be
optimistic about the case.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.629
I thought
he did terrible.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.531
He strayed so far
off course with me...

18:17.564 --> 18:18.732
he looked desperate.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.534
You could be right.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.835
He didn't
have me for lunch.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.738
Let's go.
We're back in.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.807
Jimmy,
still friends, right?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.775
You didn't touch me.
All that crap

18:28.809 --> 18:31.211
about me getting shot
and how it affected --

18:31.244 --> 18:32.579
That was stupid, Bobby.

18:32.613 --> 18:35.148
You think a jury's
going to fall for that?

18:35.181 --> 18:37.417
It was desperate.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.587
What are you doing here?

18:40.621 --> 18:42.422
Just checking in.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.924
You need anything?

18:43.957 --> 18:46.459
Nope. I'm fine.
Come on, Bec.

18:51.932 --> 18:53.499
SCOTT: When he started,

18:53.534 --> 18:55.669
when he said I could have...
could have my job back,

18:55.702 --> 18:58.672
I just felt
the blood rush to--

18:58.705 --> 19:02.308
Just that he could
pity me after that.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.778
The gun
was in your briefcase.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.714
Why did you put a gun
in your briefcase that day?

19:07.748 --> 19:10.183
Well, many reasons.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.185
When you walk around
with a holster,

19:12.218 --> 19:13.687
people look at you funny.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.722
Scott, we need
for you to be serious.

19:15.756 --> 19:19.526
Serious is working
less well for me.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.532
When you packed the gun
in your briefcase,

19:25.566 --> 19:28.802
did you plan
on killing Harry Duvall?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.436
No.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.806
No, I planned
to kill myself...

19:32.839 --> 19:34.541
or a stranger.

19:34.575 --> 19:35.909
A stranger?

19:35.942 --> 19:37.744
When, uh...

19:37.778 --> 19:40.747
when I first put it
in the briefcase, I --

19:40.781 --> 19:43.483
I thought,
I'm going to kill somebody.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.385
Probably just somebody
I passed on the street.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.386
Why?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.521
Why not?

19:47.554 --> 19:48.955
I mean, why?

19:48.989 --> 19:51.558
What happened to me was

19:51.592 --> 19:54.394
I lived my whole life
like, you know,

19:54.427 --> 19:57.798
don't drink and drive,
work hard at school,

19:57.831 --> 19:59.299
and be good
to your parents --

19:59.332 --> 20:01.735
I jumped through
all the right hoops,

20:01.768 --> 20:03.937
you know,
and it doesn't matter,

20:03.970 --> 20:06.507
does it?

20:06.540 --> 20:08.909
It's all so arbitrary.

20:08.942 --> 20:12.679
Well, I picked up a gun,
and I wanted the power.

20:12.713 --> 20:17.317
I thought it'd be,
you know, a stranger.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.685
I thought maybe I'd --

20:18.719 --> 20:20.954
Right there on the street,
and boom,

20:20.987 --> 20:22.856
and I'd look in his eyes,

20:22.889 --> 20:25.325
and I'd see
that "Why me?" look

20:25.358 --> 20:26.660
in somebody else's.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.395
So you thought
you'd kill a stranger.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.532
I don't know.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.800
Probably just myself,
you know?

20:33.834 --> 20:35.969
And when you pulled
the gun out...

20:36.002 --> 20:37.704
It was to kill myself.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.507
Then when he offered
my job back,

20:40.541 --> 20:42.876
when he tried
to be a hero,

20:42.909 --> 20:44.811
I didn't want him
to think that.

20:44.845 --> 20:46.012
I didn't want him
to strut

20:46.046 --> 20:49.883
with the idea
that he was a good friend,

20:49.916 --> 20:51.885
and, oh,
I just felt hot,

20:51.918 --> 20:55.789
and the next thing I know,

20:55.822 --> 20:58.324
he -- he was recoiling
like he'd been shot,

20:58.358 --> 20:59.893
and then I realized
he was shot,

20:59.926 --> 21:02.796
and that I was the one
that shot him, just...

21:02.829 --> 21:06.567
(imitates gunshots)

21:19.479 --> 21:22.649
Nobody moved.
I think we were all glad

21:22.683 --> 21:24.718
he didn't have his gun
up there on the stand.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.019
Did Bay cross?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.087
Tomorrow morning.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.655
So Bobby's been okay?

21:28.689 --> 21:31.658
I think he's been perfect.
He's focused...

21:31.692 --> 21:33.393
So what's he doing now?

21:33.426 --> 21:34.861
Oh, he's in there
with the shrinks,

21:34.895 --> 21:36.930
which I should
probably be, too.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.765
(door opens)

21:43.704 --> 21:45.672
Okay, Lindsay,
you were right.

21:45.706 --> 21:47.407
What?

21:47.440 --> 21:49.042
She was injected
with liquid nicotine.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.777
It simulated
all the conditions

21:50.811 --> 21:52.478
of a heart attack.

21:52.513 --> 21:55.048
We've searched her apartment.
We found two hairs,

21:55.081 --> 21:58.785
and we're running
the DNA analysis as we speak.

21:58.819 --> 22:02.355
So she was murdered.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.390
She was murdered.

22:11.967 --> 22:12.733
I'm fine, Bobby.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.434
Don't keep telling me that.
The guy --

22:14.467 --> 22:15.902
We've got a guard outside,
and they're picking Hinks up.

22:15.936 --> 22:17.470
Until they pick him up,

22:17.504 --> 22:18.739
the guard goes with you
everywhere.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.106
LUCY:
I would like one, too.

22:20.140 --> 22:21.942
I mean,
the guy's got my address,

22:21.975 --> 22:24.477
and he looked at me
like he was attracted.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.679
You get a guard, too.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.581
Bobby,
we got to get going.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.115
Come on.
Everywhere you go.

22:34.721 --> 22:35.856
Morning, Jimmy.

22:35.889 --> 22:37.791
Good morning.

22:51.004 --> 22:54.608
Jimmy, you do seem to be
taking this personally.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.510
He made it personal,
Ellenor.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.612
He was defending
his client.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.881
My personal history has
nothing to do with this case,

23:00.914 --> 23:02.415
and you know it.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.685
Well, actually,
I don't know it.

23:04.718 --> 23:07.621
I think Bobby raised
a legitimate question.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.455
I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

23:09.489 --> 23:11.792
Yes, and your not wanting
to talk about it

23:11.825 --> 23:13.827
goes straight to the question.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.967
Your testimony was
very powerful, Mr. Wallace.

23:21.001 --> 23:22.603
Glad you liked it.

23:22.636 --> 23:25.539
I aim to please --
and, of course, to shoot.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.474
Yes, I think I was
most struck by your anger.

23:28.509 --> 23:30.911
You're a very angry man,
aren't you, Mr. Wallace?

23:30.944 --> 23:33.880
You seem to have
a firm grasp of the obvious.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.917
Yes, and what's
also obvious

23:36.950 --> 23:38.184
is you just happened
to shoot

23:38.218 --> 23:40.453
the person
you were most angry at.

23:40.486 --> 23:42.022
What a coincidence.

23:42.055 --> 23:43.824
-Objection.
-Overruled.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.826
How'd you get to the meeting
that evening, Mr. Wallace?

23:45.859 --> 23:47.761
I drove.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.930
Stop
for all the traffic lights

23:49.963 --> 23:51.197
on the way over?

23:51.231 --> 23:52.465
I don't remember.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.767
Any accidents or incidents

23:53.800 --> 23:55.636
on the way
to Mr. Donnell's office?

23:55.669 --> 23:56.637
No.

23:56.670 --> 23:58.739
You were dressed how?

23:58.772 --> 24:00.641
I wore a suit.

24:00.674 --> 24:01.675
On time
for the meeting?

24:01.708 --> 24:02.843
Yes.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.578
If the meeting
had gone well

24:04.611 --> 24:06.680
and Mr. Duvall had
given you your job back,

24:06.713 --> 24:08.582
think you would have
shot him?

24:08.615 --> 24:09.783
Objection. Speculation.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.652
Sustained.

24:11.685 --> 24:13.987
Are you remorseful, sir,
for shooting Mr. Duvall?

24:17.157 --> 24:19.059
You know Sarah Duvall,

24:19.092 --> 24:21.061
Harry's wife,
sitting right over here.

24:21.094 --> 24:22.963
You know
his three children.

24:22.996 --> 24:24.965
You've just sat up here
talking

24:24.998 --> 24:27.968
about shooting a husband,
a father of three.

24:28.001 --> 24:29.970
You've talked
about killing him

24:30.003 --> 24:32.138
with all this
righteous indignation.

24:32.172 --> 24:35.141
Look at them,
Mr. Wallace, and tell them

24:35.175 --> 24:38.612
how powerful it made you feel
to be arbitrary.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.713
Should we object?

24:39.746 --> 24:41.247
No.

24:41.281 --> 24:42.716
Just explain to them

24:42.749 --> 24:44.818
how unfair
life has been to you.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.720
I am sure
they'll understand.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.722
Maybe you could even
give them some advice.

24:48.755 --> 24:51.958
Tell them
they'll feel better

24:51.992 --> 24:53.293
if they just go out

24:53.326 --> 24:55.729
and shoot
somebody themselves.

24:58.298 --> 25:02.836
I don't feel
like talking anymore.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.271
I'm not going to talk.

25:07.307 --> 25:10.110
I'm not going to talk.

25:10.143 --> 25:12.178
MICHAEL: You're going
to talk.

25:12.212 --> 25:14.748
Oh, I have something
to say, detective,

25:14.781 --> 25:17.851
but it'll be to the judge
when I file a claim

25:17.884 --> 25:20.286
for harassment,
false imprisonment --

25:20.320 --> 25:22.723
Incidentally, will this
be the last arrest,

25:22.756 --> 25:24.190
or can I expect others?

25:24.224 --> 25:25.859
I want to know where
you were two nights ago.

25:25.892 --> 25:29.563
I believe I was home alone
watching "Taxi."

25:29.596 --> 25:31.264
You think
that's funny, William?

25:31.297 --> 25:34.568
I find humor is all about
knowing your audience.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.737
While the joke
could be lost on you,

25:36.770 --> 25:42.008
I'm sure Lindsay is about
to find herself in stitches.

25:42.042 --> 25:45.311
You don't think I know
you come in to watch?

25:49.315 --> 25:50.884
People always know

25:50.917 --> 25:52.853
when they're
being watched, Lindsay.

25:52.886 --> 25:56.623
You, of all people,
should know that.

26:06.099 --> 26:07.333
I can't hold him.

26:07.367 --> 26:09.069
What do you mean? He --

26:09.102 --> 26:10.971
I've got
no evidence, Lindsay.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.038
The man --

26:12.072 --> 26:13.273
The DNA
didn't check out.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.908
It was
somebody else's hair.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.342
You already know?

26:16.376 --> 26:18.078
We can't place him
at the scene.

26:18.111 --> 26:19.913
There's nothing
to hold him with.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.715
Unless he planted
somebody else's hair,

26:21.748 --> 26:23.617
which is starting
to happen now.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.986
Maybe he did, but we have
nothing to implicate him.

26:26.019 --> 26:28.321
You're the D.A.
Give me some advice here.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.624
So he's walking back out.

26:30.657 --> 26:33.059
He basically told me
that I'm next,

26:33.093 --> 26:34.661
and out he goes?

26:42.936 --> 26:44.170
What about
just on the threats?

26:44.204 --> 26:45.338
They can't
hold him on that?

26:45.371 --> 26:47.908
Put Helen on.

26:47.941 --> 26:50.711
How overt
do they have to be?

26:50.744 --> 26:53.714
Well, how long do we wait,
Helen, till Lindsay --

26:53.747 --> 26:55.215
don't tell me
to calm down,

26:55.248 --> 26:56.783
and don't tell me
there's nothing you can do.

26:56.817 --> 26:58.384
Go out and plant
some evidence if you have to.

26:58.418 --> 27:00.220
You're the police.

27:00.253 --> 27:01.722
Bobby.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.225
Lucy, call Alan Neel.

27:05.258 --> 27:07.861
Get him in my office
this afternoon.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.830
Tell him
it's an emergency.

27:09.863 --> 27:10.931
What happened?

27:10.964 --> 27:13.399
They released Hinks.
No evidence.

27:13.433 --> 27:16.136
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Are you okay to go in there?

27:16.169 --> 27:17.403
I can do direct on Murphy.

27:17.437 --> 27:18.972
I can do it.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.140
Okay, then take a breath.

27:20.173 --> 27:22.876
-I can--
-Take a breath.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.781
You can't
just judge his sanity

27:27.814 --> 27:30.150
by the single act
of the crime.

27:30.183 --> 27:32.986
You need to consider his
whole psychiatric database.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.420
What does that mean?

27:34.454 --> 27:36.422
Basically,
his prior mental history.

27:36.456 --> 27:39.793
He'd been experiencing
deep clinical depression,

27:39.826 --> 27:41.995
he'd been exhibiting
symptoms of psychosis,

27:42.028 --> 27:45.699
seeing spots,
sleeplessness, paranoia...

27:45.732 --> 27:46.967
And when he pulled out
the gun...

27:47.000 --> 27:48.134
In my opinion,

27:48.168 --> 27:51.004
that was the culminating
psychotic act.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.405
He'd lost his ability

27:52.438 --> 27:54.407
to be responsible
for his actions.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.877
Are you saying
if a person is depressed

27:56.910 --> 27:58.979
or he sees spots,
that's a precursor

27:59.012 --> 28:00.747
that he could
become homicidal?

28:00.781 --> 28:02.082
Of course not.

28:02.115 --> 28:04.284
I'm saying in this case,
it was a precursor.

28:04.317 --> 28:06.019
Well,
with all this psychosis,

28:06.052 --> 28:07.453
did you ever recommend
he be committed?

28:07.487 --> 28:10.023
No, but I wish I had.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.025
You wish you had.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.294
Mr. Wallace
had the presence of mind

28:14.327 --> 28:16.897
to select his victim
when he shot Mr. Duvall

28:16.930 --> 28:19.165
instead of his lawyers,
didn't he, Doctor?

28:19.199 --> 28:21.768
Well, that doesn't mean
it wasn't a psychotic act.

28:21.802 --> 28:24.037
Oh, no one's denying
the psychosis here, Doctor.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.306
The question is whether
Mr. Wallace could appreciate

28:26.339 --> 28:27.841
the nature of his act.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.843
He selected the victim
who angered him.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.312
He knew to stop shooting
when he ran out of bullets.

28:32.345 --> 28:34.881
Are you making up your
own test now, Mr. Bay?
For legal--

28:34.915 --> 28:36.416
You certainly felt free
to make up yours.

28:36.449 --> 28:37.417
Objection.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.019
Sustained.

28:39.052 --> 28:41.021
The fact
that he was able

28:41.054 --> 28:42.923
to demonstrate
victim selection

28:42.956 --> 28:45.291
is proof to me he knew
exactly what he was doing.

28:45.325 --> 28:48.261
Even if his acts
were irrational, Doctor?

28:48.294 --> 28:50.163
Every murder is irrational,

28:50.196 --> 28:54.367
and this man exhibited enough
rational thought to plan this.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.937
He brought a gun
to the meeting.

28:56.970 --> 28:59.239
It's premeditation
and preparation.

29:11.084 --> 29:14.921
The psychiatric testimony
was pretty much a wash.

29:14.955 --> 29:16.489
The good thing --

29:16.523 --> 29:18.859
in Massachusetts, the burden
is on the prosecution

29:18.892 --> 29:20.226
to show you were sane.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.295
We don't have to
prove you weren't.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.798
You make it all sound
so optimistic.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.233
I could almost
lose sight of the fact

29:27.267 --> 29:29.202
that insanity defenses
are successful

29:29.235 --> 29:33.039
in less than a quarter
of 1% of all criminal cases.

29:33.073 --> 29:35.542
Scott, I have to tell you,
with your attitude,

29:35.576 --> 29:37.811
our chances
are worse than that.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.480
Well, if I get
convicted here, Rebecca,

29:40.514 --> 29:43.049
I go back to a society

29:43.083 --> 29:46.520
where there are
even bigger pariahs than me.

29:46.553 --> 29:49.890
If you're even remotely
looking forward

29:49.923 --> 29:51.958
to that society,
you're every bit as insane

29:51.992 --> 29:53.827
as we're cracking you up
to be.

29:59.399 --> 30:02.268
Where's Bobby?

30:04.037 --> 30:06.940
He's working
on his closing.

30:09.109 --> 30:11.244
I'm impressed.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.613
Business must be good.

30:12.646 --> 30:14.247
Yeah, we get by.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.282
And I hear
you're married now.

30:16.316 --> 30:19.452
Yeah...

30:19.485 --> 30:21.522
which is the reason
I called.

30:21.555 --> 30:23.857
You want me to kill her?

30:23.890 --> 30:26.860
No, I do not want you
to kill her, Alan.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.394
She's being threatened,

30:28.428 --> 30:31.264
and her life could
very well be in danger.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.265
From who?

30:32.298 --> 30:33.567
His name is William Hinks.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.401
He's a serial
psycho head chopper

30:35.435 --> 30:37.270
we just successfully
got acquitted.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.573
Now he's obsessed
or something with Lindsay.

30:39.606 --> 30:40.941
Okay.

30:40.974 --> 30:43.143
$50,000 cash up front.

30:43.176 --> 30:45.546
I'm not hiring you to --

30:45.579 --> 30:48.148
I just want you
to scare him.

30:48.181 --> 30:49.550
Scare him?

30:49.583 --> 30:51.552
The police have tried,
the D. A. s have tried.

30:51.585 --> 30:53.019
The problem is he knows

30:53.053 --> 30:54.888
there's only so much
they can do.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.557
I want him to hear it
from somebody

30:56.590 --> 30:58.559
he thinks
might actually hurt him.

30:58.592 --> 31:00.393
You're really worried, huh?

31:00.426 --> 31:04.565
We're talking
about my wife, Alan.

31:04.598 --> 31:08.134
I mean, this guy is sick.

31:08.168 --> 31:10.571
We think he just killed
his therapist.

31:10.604 --> 31:14.040
You remember, uh...

31:14.074 --> 31:16.076
I said this day would come?

31:16.109 --> 31:18.178
Sorry?

31:18.211 --> 31:20.046
You know, when I was looking
at double consecutives,

31:20.080 --> 31:21.447
and you got me off.

31:21.481 --> 31:24.050
And I said, "Someday
you're going to need me

31:24.084 --> 31:26.186
just like I needed you."

31:26.219 --> 31:28.622
I also said I'd deliver.
Remember that?

31:34.661 --> 31:37.598
Put the fear of God
in him, Alan.

31:37.631 --> 31:41.201
You got an address?

31:41.234 --> 31:43.203
Yeah, I got it
written down.

31:43.236 --> 31:44.605
Bobby -- Oh, I'm sorry.

31:44.638 --> 31:46.940
I-I'll be right out.

31:49.409 --> 31:51.612
Yeah.

31:51.645 --> 31:54.147
Pregnant, even.

31:56.416 --> 31:59.119
I'll take care of it,
Bobby.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.155
Thanks.

32:18.572 --> 32:24.511
This man had been diagnosed
long before the shooting.

32:24.545 --> 32:28.148
He was suffering from twin
positional emotional traumas --

32:28.181 --> 32:31.518
His wife's death
and being accused of it.

32:31.552 --> 32:34.721
He had been on the edge
of a psychotic break

32:34.755 --> 32:36.557
for which
he was hospitalized.

32:36.590 --> 32:39.726
This isn't a case of lawyers
and doctors finding a disorder

32:39.760 --> 32:42.195
after the event.

32:42.228 --> 32:43.997
Scott Wallace's
mental condition

32:44.030 --> 32:47.100
was pre-existing
and diagnosed months before.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.736
He had been on the edge.

32:49.770 --> 32:53.206
Karen's death, the arrest,

32:53.239 --> 32:55.642
the conviction, prison,

32:55.676 --> 32:58.111
the appeal,
the second trial --

32:58.144 --> 33:00.380
He had been living all that

33:00.413 --> 33:02.382
while suffering
clinical depression,

33:02.415 --> 33:06.219
and he finally lost it
that night with Harry Duvall,

33:06.252 --> 33:09.389
just like Dr. Murphy
told us he would.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.658
You heard
seven different experts --

33:11.692 --> 33:13.660
psychologists,
forensic psychiatrists --

33:13.694 --> 33:16.296
they all told you
to a medical certainty

33:16.329 --> 33:19.633
that Scott Wallace
had a psychotic breakdown.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.501
But you don't have to
get weighed down

33:21.535 --> 33:23.504
by all the medical jargon
and the science.

33:23.537 --> 33:28.509
The test of legal insanity,
it really comes down to this --

33:28.542 --> 33:31.244
was Scott Wallace able --

33:31.277 --> 33:34.114
Was he able
to conform his conduct

33:34.147 --> 33:36.583
to the requirements
of the law?

33:36.617 --> 33:38.519
And to answer that question,

33:38.552 --> 33:40.521
you only need
ask yourselves this --

33:40.554 --> 33:43.524
Even if the Boston police
had been right there

33:43.557 --> 33:46.126
in the room with him
that night,

33:46.159 --> 33:48.695
would he have
still shot Harry Duvall?

33:48.729 --> 33:52.533
And we all know
the answer to that question.

33:52.566 --> 33:55.468
It's yes.

33:58.238 --> 34:00.607
RICHARD: He didn't
just pull out a gun

34:00.641 --> 34:02.175
and start firing.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.611
He shot the man
who wronged him

34:04.645 --> 34:06.279
after planning it,

34:06.312 --> 34:08.581
after packing a gun
in a briefcase to conceal it.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.317
This was a reflective choice.

34:11.351 --> 34:13.786
For every psychiatrist
they put up there

34:13.820 --> 34:16.790
to declare him insane,
we put up two to say he wasn't.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.358
This is a man,

34:18.391 --> 34:22.696
when he gets angry,
he acts on that anger.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.297
That's why he was charged
with his wife's murder,

34:25.331 --> 34:28.268
for which he was convicted
at first.

34:28.301 --> 34:30.637
That's why even
his close friend Harry Duvall

34:30.670 --> 34:32.639
knew him to be a murderer,

34:32.672 --> 34:35.275
and that's why
his own lawyer...

34:35.308 --> 34:38.277
his own lawyer,
who was in the room at the time,

34:38.311 --> 34:39.646
who saw it,

34:39.679 --> 34:44.284
he knew it to be
a cold-blooded act of execution,

34:44.317 --> 34:47.120
and he told you that.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.487
BOBBY: Jimmy Berluti

34:48.522 --> 34:51.391
was a previous
gunshot victim himself.

34:51.424 --> 34:53.659
He froze when Scott Wallace
pulled out that gun.

34:53.694 --> 34:55.661
His powers of observation
were paralyzed.

34:55.696 --> 34:58.231
He didn't even do anything
to try to stop

34:58.264 --> 35:00.233
either the suicide
or the homicide.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.669
The other eyewitness,
Ellenor Frutt,

35:02.703 --> 35:07.407
she told you
Scott Wallace snapped.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.876
He pulled that gun out
to kill himself,

35:09.910 --> 35:11.878
and then he went blank,

35:11.912 --> 35:13.880
and as Scott himself
testified, the next thing,

35:13.914 --> 35:16.617
shots were being fired,
Harry Duvall was being hit.

35:16.650 --> 35:21.387
Scott Wallace
was mentally gone.

35:21.421 --> 35:23.857
And I would submit
every murderer has to be

35:23.890 --> 35:26.860
a little mentally gone
to commit a homicide.

35:26.893 --> 35:29.395
That doesn't mean
we excuse it.

35:29.429 --> 35:31.431
Scott Wallace
was fed up.

35:31.464 --> 35:32.799
He'd had enough,

35:32.833 --> 35:36.269
and now it was time
to get even.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.672
Revenge may be motive,

35:38.705 --> 35:41.542
but it's no defense.

35:41.575 --> 35:46.903
Can they prove he was sane
beyond a reasonable doubt?

35:47.848 --> 35:49.516
No.

35:49.550 --> 35:54.557
They don't prove sanity
beyond a reasonable doubt.

35:55.956 --> 35:59.225
Intent, preparation,
victim selection.

35:59.259 --> 36:00.694
He snapped.

36:00.727 --> 36:01.662
He chose.

36:01.695 --> 36:02.896
He was insane.

36:02.929 --> 36:03.897
He was angry.

36:03.930 --> 36:05.532
Not guilty.

36:05.566 --> 36:06.466
Guilty.

36:06.499 --> 36:07.834
Could he appreciate

36:07.868 --> 36:10.571
the wrongfulness
of his conduct?

36:10.604 --> 36:12.305
That's the question.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.740
Could he appreciate

36:13.774 --> 36:15.842
the wrongfulness
of his conduct?

36:15.876 --> 36:19.312
That's the question.

36:28.989 --> 36:31.958
No witnesses
to place him near the house.

36:31.992 --> 36:33.426
What about --

36:33.459 --> 36:35.862
You said that hair
could have been planted.

36:35.896 --> 36:37.330
Well, a lot
of criminals

36:37.363 --> 36:39.499
are taking advantage
of DNA evidence now

36:39.533 --> 36:41.768
by leaving a strand
of somebody else's hair

36:41.802 --> 36:43.704
or a drop
of somebody else's blood.

36:43.737 --> 36:45.739
Hinks is certainly
smart enough.

36:45.772 --> 36:47.708
He is a suspect.

36:47.741 --> 36:49.843
Yes, he is.
Lindsay, we're on it.

36:49.876 --> 36:51.745
Can you just follow him
wherever he goes?

36:51.778 --> 36:54.347
No, we really can't
do that.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.783
Truthfully, I think
it was a mistake

36:56.817 --> 36:58.885
for me
to try to scare him.

36:58.919 --> 37:00.453
Some of these psychos,

37:00.486 --> 37:03.456
you antagonize them,
they just get worse.

37:15.435 --> 37:17.938
ALAN: William Hinks?

37:54.440 --> 37:57.578
Well, you tried
a great case, Bobby.

37:57.611 --> 37:59.613
Thanks.

37:59.646 --> 38:02.616
I know I could have
been more help.

38:02.649 --> 38:05.652
I should have
flapped my arms or something.

38:08.722 --> 38:10.657
Don't you care, Scott?

38:14.628 --> 38:16.997
Scott?

38:20.901 --> 38:26.072
When I let myself care,
that's when I get hurt.

38:26.106 --> 38:28.775
You know?

38:28.809 --> 38:30.043
It's just...

38:30.076 --> 38:31.077
boom!

38:34.781 --> 38:37.551
Kidding.

38:43.924 --> 38:46.459
I started to go crazy

38:46.492 --> 38:49.996
because, you know, they were
calling me a murderer.

38:50.030 --> 38:51.632
They, uh...

38:51.665 --> 38:55.569
they said I killed my wife,
and look what happened.

38:55.602 --> 38:57.403
I became one.

38:57.437 --> 39:00.874
I mean,
I shot Harry Duvall.

39:00.907 --> 39:04.110
I turned into exactly
what they were calling me.

39:04.144 --> 39:08.148
You're not a murderer,
Scott.

39:08.181 --> 39:10.784
Yeah.

39:10.817 --> 39:12.786
Well, you're a good man,
Bobby,

39:12.819 --> 39:16.489
but that's no guarantee.

39:23.129 --> 39:25.398
(pager beeps)

39:29.770 --> 39:31.838
Verdict.

39:43.784 --> 39:47.020
JUDGE MICHAELSON: Mr. Wallace,
would you please rise?

39:47.053 --> 39:49.055
Mr. Wallace?

39:54.795 --> 39:57.664
Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:57.698 --> 39:58.865
Yes, your honor.

39:58.899 --> 40:00.500
What say you?

40:00.534 --> 40:03.570
Commonwealth
vs Scott Wallace

40:03.604 --> 40:07.040
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

40:07.073 --> 40:10.777
we find the defendant
Scott Wallace

40:10.811 --> 40:13.680
not guilty

40:13.714 --> 40:16.783
by reason of mental disease
or defect.

40:16.817 --> 40:20.120
(audience murmuring)

40:20.153 --> 40:21.788
The Commonwealth moves

40:21.822 --> 40:24.891
the defendant be committed
to a psychiatric facility.

40:24.925 --> 40:28.529
The court orders that
the defendant be hospitalized

40:28.562 --> 40:31.998
for a period of 60 days
for observation at Bridgewater.

40:32.032 --> 40:34.134
We'll consider
further petitions after that.

40:34.167 --> 40:36.169
Court is adjourned.

40:36.202 --> 40:37.738
(judge pounds gavel)

40:37.771 --> 40:39.172
What's going on?

40:39.205 --> 40:41.141
It's for observation
and treatment.

40:41.174 --> 40:44.477
It's temporary,
and, Scott, you need it.

40:44.511 --> 40:46.713
Will I get out?

40:46.747 --> 40:48.248
Probably in 60 days.

40:48.281 --> 40:51.251
Scott, you need help.

40:51.284 --> 40:53.987
Treatment
is a good thing here.

40:54.020 --> 40:56.657
Okay, okay, Bobby.

40:56.690 --> 40:59.893
Bobby, I didn't know
what to say the last time.

40:59.926 --> 41:02.996
Now...

41:03.029 --> 41:04.698
thank you.

41:12.873 --> 41:14.508
Helen?

41:17.210 --> 41:19.279
It's okay.
Lindsay's fine.

41:19.312 --> 41:20.714
What?

41:22.248 --> 41:24.518
What?

41:27.053 --> 41:29.790
Michael called me.
He's inside.

41:33.159 --> 41:34.528
BOBBY: Michael.

41:34.561 --> 41:35.796
You don't want
to go in there.

41:35.829 --> 41:36.797
I'm going in.

41:36.830 --> 41:37.798
Bobby.

41:37.831 --> 41:39.533
I'm coming in.

41:39.566 --> 41:41.802
Lindsay, stay with Helen.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.321
Hinks?

42:01.354 --> 42:03.790
Yeah.

42:05.992 --> 42:07.293
Where's his head?

42:32.819 --> 42:34.254
You have any suspects?

42:34.287 --> 42:36.156
Not yet.

42:50.170 --> 42:52.906
â™ª (theme)

43:15.428 --> 43:16.797
You stinker!
