<i>Let's add to the collection.</i>

01:05.578 --> 01:06.913
<i>Ready, Skidmark?</i>

01:07.956 --> 01:08.957
Go!

02:16.774 --> 02:18.276
<i>Thank you for the car.</i>

02:42.008 --> 02:43.760
<i>Three more traps to check.</i>

02:45.845 --> 02:47.805
<i>We're going home, Skidmark.</i>

02:47.889 --> 02:48.932
<i>We're going.</i>

05:26.422 --> 05:28.507
- What if he finds her?
- He won't.

05:28.591 --> 05:30.092
This is what Charlie does.

05:30.176 --> 05:31.719
She was at the stadium for weeks

05:31.802 --> 05:33.637
before we found out
what she was up to.

06:05.002 --> 06:06.003
It's here.

06:06.086 --> 06:08.255
- <i>It was behind the semi.</i>
- OK.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.091
Find someplace he won't.

06:11.717 --> 06:14.303
When he leaves, open the gate.

06:14.845 --> 06:15.846
Copy.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.116
Skidmark!

07:12.403 --> 07:14.280
<i>I'm in his car.
He's about to leave.</i>

07:14.363 --> 07:16.240
Hey, get out of there.
We're coming in.

07:16.323 --> 07:18.993
You know how long I've been waiting
to drop this hammer?

07:19.076 --> 07:20.494
Turn her into Swiss cheese?

07:20.578 --> 07:21.912
- <i>No, stay put.</i>
- Charlie.

07:21.996 --> 07:23.330
- I can handle it.
- Charlie!

07:23.956 --> 07:25.124
<i>Hey, Charlie!</i>

07:28.127 --> 07:29.128
Charlie!

07:58.157 --> 07:59.658
I thought you might be hungry.

08:00.284 --> 08:01.327
It's OK.

08:02.161 --> 08:03.746
You can read it if you want.

08:05.164 --> 08:06.665
I gave it to someone once.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.251
Someone about your age.

08:11.003 --> 08:13.506
It helped both of us
get through some tough times.

08:14.465 --> 08:17.009
John, June, do you copy?

08:18.385 --> 08:20.554
Still out of range,
looking for Sherry.

08:22.848 --> 08:26.185
We can't wait any longer.
We've got to go back to the woods.

08:26.268 --> 08:29.063
This web of the dead, Al's got to be
on the other side of it.

08:30.564 --> 08:32.232
- Yeah.
- She's not there.

08:34.527 --> 08:37.488
In the woods -
that's not where they are.

08:41.366 --> 08:42.534
"They"?

08:45.579 --> 08:46.789
We saw them.

08:48.332 --> 08:50.042
When they first came here.

08:50.709 --> 08:52.586
We saw them
when they set up their camp.

08:56.799 --> 08:58.968
Why didn't you tell us that
when we found you?

09:00.261 --> 09:02.263
You don't have to be
afraid of us, Dylan.

09:03.597 --> 09:04.807
You know that, right?

09:06.350 --> 09:07.351
Yeah?

09:08.769 --> 09:10.104
Hey, could you...

09:13.774 --> 09:15.067
Could you show us...

09:16.694 --> 09:18.279
where you saw that camp?

09:22.491 --> 09:23.492
There.

09:24.660 --> 09:25.703
Thank you.

09:29.248 --> 09:30.708
We're going to find our friend

09:30.791 --> 09:32.960
and we're going to find
the people who did this.

09:33.043 --> 09:34.879
Walkie us if you hear
from the others.

09:34.962 --> 09:36.088
Leave us the tow truck.

09:36.172 --> 09:39.925
I'll fix the CB, contact Strand,
and see where he's at with the plane.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.803
You can't do that on your own.

09:43.220 --> 09:44.263
I'll help.

09:47.558 --> 09:51.187
The sooner you get the plane,
the sooner you can leave, right?

09:52.521 --> 09:54.064
The sooner we can all leave.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.194
You be careful.

10:07.786 --> 10:08.954
Here.

10:15.127 --> 10:17.880
Not my color or my style.

10:18.839 --> 10:21.509
I've always preferred flying a G4.

10:21.926 --> 10:23.052
Will she fly?

10:23.761 --> 10:24.762
She'll fly.

10:25.346 --> 10:28.641
Let's load her up
and bring our friends home, shall we?

10:39.276 --> 10:41.570
OK. Let's have a look at this baby.

10:47.910 --> 10:50.120
Oh, no.

10:56.001 --> 10:57.336
Where's the six pack?

10:57.753 --> 11:00.506
Brewski or abdominal?
You ain't gonna find either here.

11:00.589 --> 11:02.466
The instrument gauges. We need those.

11:03.509 --> 11:07.471
I ALREADY SAID NO! CHANNEL 8

11:22.069 --> 11:24.446
- What's wrong, Vic?
- What's going on, man?

11:24.905 --> 11:28.033
- Where the hell are you, Daniel?
- <i>Relax, Victor.</i>

11:28.117 --> 11:30.077
I'm nowhere near the warehouse.

11:30.661 --> 11:33.038
But if you're still there
when I get back,

11:33.122 --> 11:34.999
I'm gonna make good on my promise.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.627
Think he's gonna shoot us
in our faces, or just Vic?

11:41.589 --> 11:42.590
How did you know?

11:43.716 --> 11:47.720
Because I know you, Victor.
And I was right, you haven't changed.

11:51.807 --> 11:55.186
Look, I know you got
a beef with our friend.

11:55.394 --> 11:58.856
Justifiably so,
considering the... sinus pinball.

12:00.024 --> 12:03.819
But why not just give us the GD plane
and let us be on our way?

12:04.653 --> 12:05.696
Who is this?

12:06.614 --> 12:07.781
Sarah.

12:07.865 --> 12:09.950
Stay away from that man, Sarah.

12:10.701 --> 12:13.496
<i>He has a talent for hurting
anyone who comes near him.</i>

12:14.246 --> 12:15.789
I haven't hurt anyone, Daniel.

12:15.873 --> 12:19.084
You sent a child
to do your dirty work.

12:26.133 --> 12:28.594
Show yourself, in the back.

12:33.390 --> 12:34.517
If you hurt her...

12:34.600 --> 12:36.519
<i>I am not going to hurt her, Victor.</i>

12:37.228 --> 12:40.606
I am going to save her... from you.

12:51.967 --> 12:54.344
You just gonna sit there
like a turd in the toilet,

12:54.428 --> 12:55.971
waiting for him to come back?

12:56.638 --> 12:57.973
That's what he wants.

12:59.308 --> 13:01.518
Maybe I can talk him
into giving you the plane.

13:02.936 --> 13:05.397
It's gonna be hard to talk
with your head blown off.

13:15.365 --> 13:17.242
This ain't helping anybody, Vic.

13:18.535 --> 13:19.828
This is giving up.

13:21.663 --> 13:25.917
Because some jagoff with a bunch
of shit doesn't think you've changed?

13:27.669 --> 13:30.213
Dan the Man's not here right now,
and until he is,

13:30.756 --> 13:33.508
we're gonna keep cranking
to get this bear in the air.

13:36.595 --> 13:37.929
We'll get Charlie.

13:38.930 --> 13:40.140
We'll get everyone.

13:42.476 --> 13:43.560
It won't...

13:44.895 --> 13:47.648
I can't fly the plane
without the instruments.

13:48.607 --> 13:51.193
Vic, they got to be in here
somewhere, man.

13:52.903 --> 13:55.280
Come on, you gonna make me look
all by my lonesome?

14:00.827 --> 14:02.079
- Come on.
- Yeah.

14:04.915 --> 14:06.667
- Let's go.
- All right.

14:12.130 --> 14:13.465
Where are you taking me?

14:15.759 --> 14:18.387
I meant what I said.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

14:20.055 --> 14:21.473
You shouldn't blame Victor.

14:22.015 --> 14:24.726
I knew what I was doing.
I had my reasons.

14:24.810 --> 14:25.978
You're a child.

14:27.062 --> 14:28.188
He knows better.

14:38.115 --> 14:39.866
Did you set up the traps around here?

14:42.411 --> 14:43.745
You've been watching me?

14:48.208 --> 14:50.168
No, I didn't set the traps.

14:51.628 --> 14:54.131
But... you're disarming them.

14:55.007 --> 14:56.008
Why?

14:57.259 --> 14:58.844
You ask too many questions.

15:07.894 --> 15:09.271
Is this the live recording?

15:13.692 --> 15:14.901
You know Son House?

15:26.913 --> 15:28.081
What's your name?

15:37.507 --> 15:38.717
What's it about?

15:41.511 --> 15:43.805
The book, how can it help?

15:45.557 --> 15:48.143
There's a pilot
who crashes his plane in the desert.

15:49.061 --> 15:52.022
He finds a little prince
who has left his home planet...

15:52.981 --> 15:54.733
traveling from place to place.

15:58.028 --> 15:59.237
Why did he leave?

16:00.572 --> 16:01.573
To learn things.

16:02.824 --> 16:03.951
To meet friends.

16:05.494 --> 16:07.913
- What did he learn?
- To look beneath the surface.

16:08.705 --> 16:10.749
To not be afraid of the unexpected.

16:13.669 --> 16:17.798
Dylan, if there is anything
you want to talk about... you can.

16:18.840 --> 16:19.841
I know.

16:25.639 --> 16:26.890
We need electrical tape.

16:27.891 --> 16:28.934
I can get it.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.120
Olly olly oxen free.

16:50.038 --> 16:51.456
<i>Dylan, are you alone?</i>

16:51.665 --> 16:53.083
Yeah, I was careful.

16:54.084 --> 16:55.961
I'm using channel nine,
like you said.

16:56.044 --> 16:58.297
OK. They cut down
some more of our growlers.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.381
<i>Where?</i>

16:59.673 --> 17:01.883
By the old utility road,
near the gas station.

17:03.385 --> 17:06.555
I didn't send them that way.
They're trying to find their friend.

17:08.390 --> 17:09.891
Then who the hell did this?

17:11.685 --> 17:12.685
Max?

17:16.022 --> 17:17.232
Shit.

17:22.945 --> 17:23.946
Stay down.

17:31.079 --> 17:31.913
<i>Max?</i>

17:35.000 --> 17:36.001
Annie?

17:37.377 --> 17:38.420
Everything OK?

17:40.922 --> 17:42.966
I couldn't find the tape.

17:44.551 --> 17:45.677
It's in back.

17:48.597 --> 17:49.598
Let's go.

17:59.358 --> 18:00.400
Wait here.

18:03.737 --> 18:04.738
Come on.

18:31.598 --> 18:33.642
<i>This one's going to be tricky,
Skidmark.</i>

18:39.606 --> 18:42.818
Slip in the back,
away from all the windows.

18:44.152 --> 18:48.657
Throw a can to the other end of
the store, and use something heavy,

18:49.283 --> 18:51.326
like peaches or artichoke hearts.

18:53.078 --> 18:55.080
Nobody ever takes
the artichoke hearts.

18:57.249 --> 18:59.167
Use the shelves in aisle two as cover

18:59.251 --> 19:03.046
and unclip the belt from the gun,
and come out the front.

19:05.757 --> 19:07.259
I used to do the same thing.

19:08.010 --> 19:09.344
Pick over the dead.

19:10.387 --> 19:12.639
Sometimes I would use music
to distract them

19:12.723 --> 19:14.182
so I could steal their things.

19:18.186 --> 19:20.063
Except I didn't kill people to do it.

19:26.445 --> 19:27.904
I know what you're thinking.

19:29.114 --> 19:30.616
But I didn't do this.

19:32.284 --> 19:35.037
I inherited the warehouse
from the person who did.

19:36.371 --> 19:40.542
Who killed them
so their things could sit on a shelf.

19:42.919 --> 19:44.546
Why are they still sitting there?

19:45.213 --> 19:47.174
It's hard to find people these days.

19:50.010 --> 19:51.219
That's not true.

19:53.805 --> 19:56.224
One of them came to your door,
asking for help.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.565
Let's go find some artichoke hearts.

21:16.847 --> 21:17.848
<i>Run!</i>

21:31.028 --> 21:31.862
Skidmark!

21:34.489 --> 21:36.408
<i>I'm gonna leave you behind one day.</i>

22:00.606 --> 22:04.026
- How much ammo do you have?
- About half of what it would take.

22:05.069 --> 22:06.571
And we'd only draw more.

22:07.029 --> 22:09.115
Yeah, but we can outrun them.

22:09.615 --> 22:12.452
The herd will grow.
Eventually they will hurt someone.

22:13.077 --> 22:14.328
We need to stop it.

22:15.955 --> 22:18.666
We'll lead it to the warehouse.
The gates will hold.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.502
Then we'll pick them off, one by one.

22:36.100 --> 22:37.101
Hey.

22:48.654 --> 22:49.739
Nothing.

22:50.490 --> 22:52.450
I think Dylan
might have been confused.

22:53.076 --> 22:54.619
Well, he's been through a lot.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.082
Do you think he's
telling us everything?

23:02.668 --> 23:04.378
<i>Luciana, do you copy?</i>

23:07.715 --> 23:08.925
I'm here, Morgan.

23:09.008 --> 23:11.260
So, we're at the coordinates
that Dylan gave.

23:11.803 --> 23:13.054
There's no camp here.

23:13.596 --> 23:15.348
No sign that there ever was.

23:16.682 --> 23:18.267
<i>We're gonna go into the woods.</i>

23:18.351 --> 23:21.270
<i>John and June come into range,
tell them to meet us there.</i>

23:21.687 --> 23:23.064
No. No, no, no.

23:26.150 --> 23:27.151
That you, Dylan?

23:28.945 --> 23:31.906
- Go to the old utility road.
- <i>Why? What's there?</i>

23:33.783 --> 23:35.743
Just go. Near the gas station.

23:35.827 --> 23:37.412
Listen, we got to find our friend

23:37.495 --> 23:40.706
so that what happened to your brother
and sister won't happen again.

23:40.790 --> 23:42.083
They're not dead.

23:51.050 --> 23:51.926
What?

23:54.220 --> 23:55.304
We lied.

23:57.265 --> 23:58.266
I lied.

23:59.434 --> 24:01.102
<i>We faked the whole thing.</i>

24:02.562 --> 24:03.938
Why would you do that?

24:05.690 --> 24:07.233
Because we were scared.

24:08.526 --> 24:09.360
<i>Dylan...</i>

24:10.695 --> 24:12.864
<i>Please. Max and Annie
are in trouble.</i>

24:12.947 --> 24:16.200
I'm sorry we lied,
but they need help.

24:16.284 --> 24:17.452
Please.

24:30.715 --> 24:31.841
Is it clear?

24:34.051 --> 24:35.219
I think they left.

24:47.356 --> 24:48.691
- It's OK.
- OK.

24:48.775 --> 24:49.942
I think they're gone.

24:56.032 --> 24:57.200
Come on!

25:00.036 --> 25:01.579
No, we got to go! We got to go!

25:04.749 --> 25:05.750
No!

25:14.467 --> 25:16.344
<i>Sarah? Wendell? Do you guys copy?</i>

25:17.220 --> 25:19.222
Charlie, where are you? Are you OK?

25:19.305 --> 25:20.181
I'm fine.

25:21.599 --> 25:22.600
We're fine.

25:23.518 --> 25:24.769
<i>At least, we will be.</i>

25:25.853 --> 25:27.897
Daniel, where are
the damn instruments?

25:39.784 --> 25:41.119
<i>They're here, Victor.</i>

25:41.953 --> 25:45.790
Did you really think I'd leave them
anywhere you could get them?

25:45.873 --> 25:48.042
Daniel, I'm begging you.

25:48.209 --> 25:51.671
Our friends' lives may be in danger.
Bring them back.

25:52.255 --> 25:55.925
That's exactly what we're doing,
but we picked up some friends.

25:58.302 --> 25:59.679
There's a herd behind us.

26:00.930 --> 26:03.307
May not have to shoot you
in your face after all.

26:03.391 --> 26:04.517
<i>Close the gates.</i>

26:04.600 --> 26:06.811
Make sure the curb stops
are in place,

26:06.894 --> 26:08.938
and we'll climb over if we have to.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.775
Hate to crash your conversation
with bad news,

26:12.859 --> 26:14.861
but there's a bit of a hole
in that plan...

26:15.611 --> 26:17.655
about 36 feet wide.

26:18.156 --> 26:21.159
I had to break your fence down
to get this bird out of its cage.

26:28.291 --> 26:30.334
What? Why are you laughing?

26:32.420 --> 26:35.465
Because I said I would help you,
but going back there like this,

26:35.548 --> 26:37.341
putting your life at risk,

26:37.884 --> 26:40.094
I would be doing
the same things as Victor.

26:50.354 --> 26:51.564
Why are you stopping?

26:54.525 --> 26:55.902
You know how to drive?

26:56.903 --> 26:57.904
Kind of.

26:59.822 --> 27:02.950
Take the instruments to Victor,
get the plane and go.

27:03.034 --> 27:05.286
But I don't want
to just leave you here.

27:05.369 --> 27:07.246
Your friends need help.

27:09.415 --> 27:11.292
You can't help them
without the plane.

27:11.918 --> 27:13.044
What about you?

27:14.545 --> 27:15.713
I'll take care of them.

27:16.839 --> 27:19.133
- How?
- The same way you used to.

27:26.140 --> 27:27.141
Go.

28:13.420 --> 28:14.755
He just handed them over?

28:15.506 --> 28:17.633
He said he wanted to help me, but...

28:17.716 --> 28:19.843
if he led walkers here
with the gate down...

28:19.927 --> 28:22.721
...he'd hurt us, like I hurt him.

28:24.056 --> 28:26.683
Got to boogie if we're gonna get
that bear up in the air.

28:31.814 --> 28:32.815
Daniel?

28:36.360 --> 28:37.361
Daniel?

28:39.613 --> 28:41.240
I'm sorry about what happened.

28:43.283 --> 28:45.911
I'm sorry... I tried to kill you.

28:47.663 --> 28:49.748
I'm sorry about
whatever pain you're in.

28:51.166 --> 28:55.504
But if you're putting yourself
in danger to teach me a lesson,

28:55.587 --> 28:56.755
then don't.

28:58.382 --> 29:01.802
You still think this is about what
you did to me at the dam, Victor?

29:04.555 --> 29:06.098
What is it about, then, Daniel?

29:08.058 --> 29:11.437
The same thing
it's always about with you - lies.

29:13.105 --> 29:14.189
What lies?

29:15.649 --> 29:16.859
What does that mean?

29:17.735 --> 29:19.111
<i>Tell them, Victor.</i>

29:20.070 --> 29:22.406
Tell them how you kept me
from Ofelia.

29:31.832 --> 29:33.542
<i>I want to hear you say it.</i>

29:40.215 --> 29:43.844
Daniel... got separated
from his daughter.

29:45.971 --> 29:47.890
<i>I told him that I knew
where she was.</i>

29:49.600 --> 29:53.479
I lied... because I needed
something from him.

29:54.521 --> 29:55.522
And when...

29:56.190 --> 29:58.942
And when he finally got to her...

29:59.818 --> 30:01.361
when he finally found her...

30:02.738 --> 30:03.906
it was too late.

30:10.329 --> 30:12.706
You wasted time I did not have.

30:13.707 --> 30:16.960
<i>And I couldn't tell her
what I wanted her to know.</i>

30:23.634 --> 30:24.885
What was it?

30:28.347 --> 30:29.598
Doesn't matter now.

30:35.896 --> 30:39.149
Guys... we can't just
leave him behind.

30:39.733 --> 30:43.195
We said we were going to help people,
and here is someone we can help.

30:52.204 --> 30:53.455
We can't outrun them!

30:53.539 --> 30:55.249
We've got to find a place to hole up!

31:01.296 --> 31:02.423
Annie, come on!

31:16.311 --> 31:17.146
Hey, hey.

31:19.940 --> 31:21.024
How did you find us?

31:21.108 --> 31:23.694
Your brother told us
you were in trouble.

31:25.112 --> 31:26.697
I knew Dylan would crack.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.198
He's worried about you.

31:28.657 --> 31:30.242
You have no idea what's going on.

31:30.325 --> 31:31.535
So tell us.

31:33.912 --> 31:35.247
We're not gonna hurt you.

31:36.248 --> 31:37.666
And it's just us here now.

31:57.186 --> 31:58.604
It's not just us.

32:34.890 --> 32:37.684
<i>Daniel, I'm sorry about Ofelia.</i>

32:39.812 --> 32:41.688
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

32:42.356 --> 32:43.816
I'm just asking for the chance

32:43.899 --> 32:45.901
to show you that I'm not
that man any more.

32:45.984 --> 32:49.029
- <i>Let us help you.</i>
- I told you to leave, Victor.

32:50.906 --> 32:54.576
<i>We would, but my brother's been
itching to bring down the hammer.</i>

32:55.869 --> 32:56.870
Hammer?

32:57.121 --> 32:58.247
<i>Coming in hot.</i>

33:19.393 --> 33:22.146
Hug the van, Dan.
Time to stir up some beef.

33:38.787 --> 33:39.913
Now!

33:44.001 --> 33:45.210
Come on!

33:49.131 --> 33:50.257
Hit it again!

34:07.566 --> 34:08.817
We got a problem, guys.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.444
He's stuck under us.

34:11.402 --> 34:13.030
<i>Don't give up on me yet, Daniel.</i>

34:38.722 --> 34:39.723
Hey!

34:40.349 --> 34:41.183
Hey!

34:41.934 --> 34:42.935
Come on!

34:43.393 --> 34:44.395
Hey!

34:45.478 --> 34:46.522
Over here!

34:47.231 --> 34:48.232
Come on!

34:48.440 --> 34:50.567
Come on! Right here! Right here!

35:17.636 --> 35:19.054
Oh, shit.

35:39.908 --> 35:40.951
Oh, my God.

35:56.008 --> 35:57.426
Soup's on. Get the ladle.

36:51.313 --> 36:53.357
I'm not gonna shoot you in the face.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.707
Now we just have to test it.

37:19.332 --> 37:20.834
Thank you for helping me.

37:22.335 --> 37:24.254
<i>Dylan? Dylan, pick up.</i>

37:24.921 --> 37:26.506
Annie? Are you all right?

37:27.299 --> 37:28.758
What did you tell them?

37:29.342 --> 37:32.304
They were telling the truth before,
Annie. They want to help.

37:32.887 --> 37:34.389
Are you that stupid, Dylan?

37:34.472 --> 37:36.766
It's the truth.
I think they can help us, too.

37:37.684 --> 37:38.727
He's right.

37:39.686 --> 37:41.229
We can all help each other.

37:42.605 --> 37:43.440
Please...

37:45.108 --> 37:46.943
let's put down our weapons.

37:50.739 --> 37:51.906
Annie.

38:03.418 --> 38:04.461
Thank you.

38:08.340 --> 38:11.468
Dylan said some other people
came here... before us.

38:11.551 --> 38:13.011
People who scared you.

38:16.264 --> 38:18.350
We think they might be
the ones who took Al.

38:20.101 --> 38:21.227
Who are they?

38:23.772 --> 38:26.066
Our offer still stands.
You can come with us.

38:26.149 --> 38:28.026
We just need to know where Al is.

38:28.526 --> 38:31.029
Look, we can help you
find your friend.

38:31.696 --> 38:34.032
But like we said before,
we can't leave.

38:35.408 --> 38:36.409
Why?

38:40.121 --> 38:41.623
People back at the camp.

38:44.292 --> 38:45.961
They were your parents, right?

38:57.389 --> 38:58.556
You've been there.

39:07.899 --> 39:09.025
I'm sorry.

39:48.148 --> 39:49.733
What were you going to tell her?

39:59.743 --> 40:03.371
That every day
brings a chance to start over.

40:05.415 --> 40:06.916
A chance to get it right.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.463
Something tells me
you need to hear that, too.

40:20.513 --> 40:21.514
Wait.

40:22.057 --> 40:23.224
Where are you going?

40:24.601 --> 40:27.812
There's a reason I've been here
on my own for this long.

40:28.271 --> 40:29.939
I need to go and take care of it.

40:31.316 --> 40:33.777
Well... you want company?

40:41.368 --> 40:42.827
Your friends need you here.

40:44.037 --> 40:45.830
But I set the record player up.

40:57.842 --> 40:59.260
Look after Skidmark.

41:01.554 --> 41:04.057
You're welcome to stay
until you help your friends.

41:04.140 --> 41:06.309
Everything here, consider it yours.

41:06.601 --> 41:08.645
Except for this.

41:10.397 --> 41:13.817
A friend asked me to save this
for when things get better.

41:56.526 --> 41:57.527
Hey.

42:10.999 --> 42:12.125
Here goes.

42:16.671 --> 42:17.714
Strand?

42:18.548 --> 42:19.549
Are you there?

42:20.300 --> 42:21.426
Do you copy?

42:23.762 --> 42:26.264
<i>Hey. We're here, Luciana.
Are you OK?</i>

42:26.514 --> 42:29.059
Yes! How is it going with the plane?

42:31.519 --> 42:33.229
We managed to help someone with it,

42:33.730 --> 42:37.442
but in so doing, the engines
were damaged beyond repair.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.321
It won't fly?

42:41.404 --> 42:43.156
I wish I had better news.

42:43.990 --> 42:45.909
But we'll find a way
to bring you home.

42:47.577 --> 42:48.620
The pilot.

42:50.914 --> 42:53.208
In the book, he crashes
his plane in the desert.

42:53.667 --> 42:55.043
How did he get out?

42:56.127 --> 43:00.340
He fixed his plane, put it back
together and flew away.

43:01.007 --> 43:02.467
So why don't you do that?

43:04.928 --> 43:07.180
If he can do it, so can you.

43:14.980 --> 43:18.775
We saw them here a few weeks ago.
They had weapons, uniforms.

43:19.025 --> 43:21.987
- Any idea how many?
- Two, but there could be more.

43:27.283 --> 43:29.244
They have to know
this place isn't safe.

43:30.829 --> 43:31.955
They do know.

43:33.331 --> 43:34.374
I knew.

43:37.043 --> 43:38.920
My wife turned close to the start.

43:39.963 --> 43:41.589
And my son and I...

43:42.674 --> 43:43.925
I couldn't kill her.

43:44.592 --> 43:47.304
Couldn't bring myself
to leave her behind, so...

43:48.346 --> 43:49.389
we stayed...

43:50.181 --> 43:51.891
even after we shouldn't have.

43:55.562 --> 43:56.604
Your son?

43:59.274 --> 44:02.944
I lost him when he couldn't
bring himself to kill her, either.

44:09.159 --> 44:10.452
What were their names?

44:13.038 --> 44:14.331
She was Jenny.

44:16.916 --> 44:18.084
He's Dwayne.

44:22.797 --> 44:23.632
Wait.

44:24.507 --> 44:25.550
Wait.

44:32.932 --> 44:33.767
Get down!

44:37.228 --> 44:38.063
Stay down!

44:54.621 --> 44:55.830
What the hell is that?

45:00.585 --> 45:03.004
Those people, they came in that.

45:05.590 --> 45:06.716
Why are they leaving?

45:07.634 --> 45:09.427
Maybe they got what they came for.
