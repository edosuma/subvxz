WEBVTT

00:06.903 --> 00:08.905
I feel like I'll say
the wrong thing.

00:08.905 --> 00:10.320
You really can't.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.184
There are
no wrong answers here.

00:14.255 --> 00:15.739
Okay.

00:19.088 --> 00:21.573
His kindness.

00:21.573 --> 00:26.233
He's very kind.

00:26.233 --> 00:30.547
Something you love
and appreciate about Maggie?

00:30.547 --> 00:33.550
Yeah.

00:33.550 --> 00:36.415
I guess I am--

00:36.415 --> 00:38.728
well, I love--I love
that she's here this morning,

00:38.728 --> 00:41.110
because that means
that she's finally admitting

00:41.110 --> 00:43.077
that we need help communicating.

00:43.077 --> 00:47.081
So...

00:47.081 --> 00:50.119
And I--

00:50.119 --> 00:54.985
I appreciate
how hard Maggie works.

00:54.985 --> 00:57.298
How is that a bad thing?

00:57.298 --> 00:58.955
How is what I said bad?

00:58.955 --> 01:01.440
<i>Every life on the planet
begins as a single cell,</i>

01:01.440 --> 01:04.547
<i>which splits and multiplies
over and over again.</i>

01:04.547 --> 01:06.066
<i>Each cell has a purpose.</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:08.137
Okay, the kids
are dressed and ready,

01:08.137 --> 01:10.104
and you're... still not up.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.658
I can't.
I feel awful.

01:12.658 --> 01:16.490
Can you take Luna to day care
for me so that I can sleep?

01:16.490 --> 01:18.492
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:18.492 --> 01:21.460
<i>And as it forms, internal
and external forces</i>

01:21.460 --> 01:24.222
<i>converge on it.</i>

01:24.222 --> 01:26.569
I know what you're doing.

01:26.569 --> 01:27.501
What, trying to spend
a little more time

01:27.501 --> 01:29.123
with my wife?

01:29.123 --> 01:30.642
Now, you're gonna
have to go home

01:30.642 --> 01:32.264
and then come back
at the end of the day.

01:32.264 --> 01:34.991
Yeah, well, I got
the day off, so I got time.

01:34.991 --> 01:39.927
Two extra trips,
more carbon footprint,

01:39.927 --> 01:42.240
killing the planet--
think of our children.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.827
You see?

01:43.827 --> 01:46.313
They've extended
the security perimeter,

01:46.313 --> 01:47.969
perfectly safe.

01:47.969 --> 01:50.248
<i>Signaling to the cell
what it will become.</i>

01:50.248 --> 01:52.353
<i>We call this process differentiation.</i>

01:52.353 --> 01:54.976
Thanks for the ride.

01:54.976 --> 01:58.048
- Love you.
- It'll be fine.

01:58.048 --> 02:01.673
<i>An arm, a bone, a brain...</i>

02:01.673 --> 02:04.158
Hi, good morning.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.539
Perfectly safe.

02:05.539 --> 02:06.678
<i>All cells take a journey</i>

02:06.678 --> 02:10.130
<i>from generalized
to specialized.</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:11.993
Sorry, sorry.
I know I'm a little late.

02:11.993 --> 02:13.650
I have roommates,
tandem parking.

02:13.650 --> 02:15.963
Anyway, I am here
for my plasma donation.

02:15.963 --> 02:20.070
We don't call it a donation
when you're taking $75 for it.

02:20.070 --> 02:21.348
Fair point.

02:21.348 --> 02:23.315
They go
from nothing to something--

02:23.315 --> 02:24.558
You're three pounds underweight.

02:24.558 --> 02:25.697
Can't give plasma today.

02:25.697 --> 02:27.181
Not possible.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.734
I do this every two months.
Check your records.

02:28.734 --> 02:29.804
Check the scale.

02:29.804 --> 02:32.290
Come back when you qualify.

02:32.290 --> 02:36.742
<i>Or what you could be
to what you are.</i>

02:36.742 --> 02:39.089
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Good morning.

02:39.089 --> 02:40.815
Do you want to meet up
if you have a break,

02:40.815 --> 02:42.023
on-call room on four?

02:42.023 --> 02:43.404
<i>Sounds fun.</i>

02:43.404 --> 02:45.026
<i>Might take me
a while to get there.</i>

02:45.026 --> 02:46.027
<i>I'm in Phoenix.</i>

02:46.027 --> 02:47.512
Why?

02:47.512 --> 02:48.927
<i>Because that's
where my next job is.</i>

02:48.927 --> 02:50.515
<i>I finished my gig in Seattle.</i>
- What?

02:50.515 --> 02:51.654
You never said anything.

02:51.654 --> 02:53.725
I was with you two days ago.

02:53.725 --> 02:55.485
<i>Well, you always seem
more interested</i>

02:55.485 --> 02:57.487
<i>in the on-call room on four
than actually talking.</i>

02:57.487 --> 02:59.731
I--

02:59.731 --> 03:01.215
<i>I got to go.</i>

03:01.215 --> 03:03.700
<i>Let me know
if you're ever in Phoenix.</i>

03:03.700 --> 03:05.323
I mean, I'd just
as soon elope,

03:05.323 --> 03:07.842
but Trey and his family--
super into tradition.

03:07.842 --> 03:10.914
When he asked his brother
to be his best man, he cried.

03:10.914 --> 03:14.539
My sister and I
hardly speak, and--

03:14.539 --> 03:16.679
She's trying to say that
she needs a maid of honor.

03:16.679 --> 03:19.751
Oh, I like you so much,
but I would be bad at that job.

03:19.751 --> 03:21.201
Hey, what the hell?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.581
You left me again.
- Be on time.

03:22.581 --> 03:24.514
You know, if
your silver-spoon, nepotism ass

03:24.514 --> 03:26.930
isn't in the seat
by 7:00, you are out of luck.

03:26.930 --> 03:29.519
Tough, punctual, efficient--
there's your maid of honor.

03:29.519 --> 03:31.038
- What?
- Forget it.

03:31.038 --> 03:32.557
But you said 6:45.

03:32.557 --> 03:34.144
Yes, because
we gave you a fake time

03:34.144 --> 03:36.388
that's 15 minutes before we're
actually planning to leave.

03:36.388 --> 03:38.045
And yet,
you still can't make it.

03:38.045 --> 03:39.598
Well, you could
have woken me up.

03:39.598 --> 03:40.910
Does anybody have my back here?

03:40.910 --> 03:42.463
No.

04:01.965 --> 04:04.002
Oh, okay.
Yes, I understand.

04:04.002 --> 04:06.315
And I appreciate it, but--

04:06.315 --> 04:07.281
Okay.
Thank you.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.559
Busy morning?

04:09.559 --> 04:11.561
How come no one ever mentions
that part of the chief job

04:11.561 --> 04:13.943
is actually being a reference
for other institutions

04:13.943 --> 04:15.427
who are looking
to poach your surgeons?

04:15.427 --> 04:16.980
Not following.

04:16.980 --> 04:19.017
Harvard Med, NYU,
Heart Center of Chicago,

04:19.017 --> 04:20.398
they're all on my call list

04:20.398 --> 04:22.020
because they are interested
in Pierce.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.470
How long
has she been working here?

04:23.470 --> 04:25.506
Maybe there is something
in her contract

04:25.506 --> 04:27.301
that prohibits her
from leaving.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.648
- Leaving? Maggie?
- Yeah.

04:29.648 --> 04:32.099
That article has given her
a lot of attention.

04:32.099 --> 04:34.135
Look, I don't wanna hold anyone
back, but we just lost Grey.

04:34.135 --> 04:35.965
I mean, how do we get
Pierce to stay?

04:35.965 --> 04:37.587
Yeah, I'm on it.

04:37.587 --> 04:38.588
Oh, great. Thanks.

04:38.588 --> 04:41.211
I'm sorry--yeah, hi.

04:41.211 --> 04:43.144
This is she.

04:44.456 --> 04:47.321
So cough and sniffles,
bed six.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.840
Nothing like half a decade
of medical training

04:48.840 --> 04:50.359
to use on a runny nose.

04:50.359 --> 04:51.843
You know, I had a patient
who had sniffles.

04:51.843 --> 04:54.190
Turned out he had
a CSF leak in his brain, so--

04:54.190 --> 04:56.123
Uh, oh, complex
trauma case transferred

04:56.123 --> 04:57.331
from a rural hospital.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.815
Kwan, you wanna see
the helipad?

04:58.815 --> 05:00.196
- Oh, yeah.
- Just Kwan or--

05:00.196 --> 05:01.231
Adams, code phlegm.

05:01.231 --> 05:02.681
Bed five needs a Neti pot.

05:02.681 --> 05:04.234
Thank God you're here.

05:05.788 --> 05:07.997
Ma'am, please try
to keep your mask on.

05:07.997 --> 05:09.826
Agh, help!

05:09.826 --> 05:11.241
I need a doctor.

05:11.241 --> 05:12.312
- Move.
- I saw him first.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.727
- Nope.
- No--

05:13.727 --> 05:15.349
Hey, hey.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.179
Have you been injured?

05:18.179 --> 05:20.181
Okay, rodeo wreck--
rider in Oregon

05:20.181 --> 05:22.805
got bucked off and stomped on
by a 1,000-pound bull.

05:22.805 --> 05:25.255
It's barbaric--bull riding.

05:25.255 --> 05:26.636
Nothing but
testosterone addicts

05:26.636 --> 05:28.017
getting off
on torturing animals

05:28.017 --> 05:29.398
because it makes them feel
more like a man.

05:29.398 --> 05:31.400
Huh.
Let's go.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.711
Kay, what do we got?

05:32.711 --> 05:34.748
Georgia Arkins, 16.
Crush injuries

05:34.748 --> 05:36.370
from being trampled by a bull.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.097
GCS 15, CT scan shows
a retrohepatic hematoma

05:39.097 --> 05:40.650
from an IVC tear,

05:40.650 --> 05:42.100
multiple lumbar
burst fractures.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.515
Vital signs are stable.

05:43.515 --> 05:44.723
She's been given
sedatives for transfer,

05:44.723 --> 05:46.104
so she's a little out of it.

05:46.104 --> 05:47.243
Local hospital didn't feel
equipped to handle

05:47.243 --> 05:48.900
her complex injuries.
- Thank you.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.419
Can I go again?

05:50.419 --> 05:52.179
The bull, can I go again?

05:52.179 --> 05:53.698
I only got to 5 seconds.

05:53.698 --> 05:55.009
So anything you want to add

05:55.009 --> 05:57.253
to your initial assessment,
Kwan?

05:57.253 --> 05:58.288
Look up for me.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.500
He's exaggerating.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.846
Ever since the interview,
she's received

06:03.846 --> 06:06.020
half a dozen amazing offers,

06:06.020 --> 06:09.092
including a position in
bioartificial heart research.

06:09.092 --> 06:11.578
So we inject
an extracellular matrix

06:11.578 --> 06:14.443
of a pig's heart, which serves
as, like, scaffolding,

06:14.443 --> 06:17.066
with human stem cells,
that it can grow

06:17.066 --> 06:18.619
cardiac muscle tissue.

06:18.619 --> 06:21.070
And then we electrically
stimulate them to twitch,

06:21.070 --> 06:23.728
cell by cell, until they start
to beat together,

06:23.728 --> 06:26.903
essentially as
one beating heart.

06:26.903 --> 06:28.215
It's beautiful.

06:28.215 --> 06:29.458
Yeah, which means more hearts

06:29.458 --> 06:31.563
for people who need them.

06:31.563 --> 06:34.255
The research is
at the Heart Center of Chicago.

06:34.255 --> 06:37.811
Oh.
Well, that's a fantastic city.

06:37.811 --> 06:39.606
Yes, it is!

06:39.606 --> 06:42.436
It's the Art Institute
and Steppenwolf,

06:42.436 --> 06:43.886
deep dish pizza.

06:43.886 --> 06:45.577
You can keep
those winters, though,

06:45.577 --> 06:48.787
with the wind just ripping in
off the lake like that.

06:48.787 --> 06:50.548
That's what parkas
and mittens are for.

06:50.548 --> 06:52.722
And it's weak pizza, really.

06:52.722 --> 06:54.483
It's just quantity
over quality.

06:54.483 --> 06:56.623
So are you considering it?

06:56.623 --> 06:58.314
Well, I might like to, but--

06:58.314 --> 06:59.591
Look, I've already moved
across the country

06:59.591 --> 07:01.110
for you once.

07:01.110 --> 07:02.767
And then, when I tried
to change my specialty,

07:02.767 --> 07:05.632
also for you, you lost
all respect for me.

07:05.632 --> 07:07.185
So--

07:07.185 --> 07:08.497
Please don't put words
into my mouth.

07:08.497 --> 07:10.084
Those are your words.

07:10.084 --> 07:11.776
You put those words
in your own mouth.

07:17.609 --> 07:21.095
I have to go.

07:21.095 --> 07:23.926
- You have to go now?
- Can we pick this up?

07:23.926 --> 07:26.169
God's sake, Maggie,
I have waited weeks,

07:26.169 --> 07:28.206
weeks of just tiptoeing around,

07:28.206 --> 07:31.002
going along with this ceasefire
that you proposed

07:31.002 --> 07:32.831
until we could get in here
and try to fix this.

07:32.831 --> 07:35.696
And now you're on the hot seat,
so you just want to walk out?

07:35.696 --> 07:39.148
You know, no, I'm not even
that surprised by this.

07:39.148 --> 07:41.046
I'm on trauma call, Winston.

07:45.534 --> 07:47.156
Please excuse me.

08:07.072 --> 08:09.385
Hey, what are you doing here?

08:09.385 --> 08:10.524
The kids okay?

08:10.524 --> 08:13.147
Everyone's fine, except you.

08:13.147 --> 08:14.563
You're not fine.

08:14.563 --> 08:16.737
And you're also not sick.

08:16.737 --> 08:19.809
I am sick.
What are you doing here?

08:19.809 --> 08:22.432
I took the kids to day care,
and I took a personal day,

08:22.432 --> 08:26.195
because your body does this.

08:26.195 --> 08:27.921
My body does what?

08:27.921 --> 08:30.993
It aches so that you'll rest
because it's learned

08:30.993 --> 08:32.546
that if it aches,
you'll stay in bed,

08:32.546 --> 08:35.031
when nothing else works
to keep you in bed.

08:35.031 --> 08:38.103
You need a day off,
but you're not sick,

08:38.103 --> 08:42.245
which is why you get a latte

08:42.245 --> 08:45.455
and...

08:49.045 --> 08:54.361
The little doughnuts
with the pink frosting.

08:56.087 --> 08:57.433
You took the day off?

08:57.433 --> 09:00.022
Yeah, I figured
you could use the company.

09:00.022 --> 09:04.095
Plus, after I eat three boxes
of these, I'm no good at work.

09:04.095 --> 09:05.924
You ate three boxes?

09:05.924 --> 09:07.719
No, but I'm about to.

09:10.411 --> 09:11.585
You might want to look away.

09:12.759 --> 09:13.794
I'm just gonna go.

09:13.794 --> 09:16.038
No.

09:16.038 --> 09:18.696
- Ow!
- Any feeling of nausea?

09:18.696 --> 09:21.940
Ah, not really.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.425
Is there anything
you can do about the pain?

09:24.425 --> 09:26.945
It feels like someone's
dicing my intestines.

09:26.945 --> 09:28.740
We'll take care of that
for you in a moment.

09:28.740 --> 09:30.397
But I need to finish
this physical exam

09:30.397 --> 09:32.088
before we can--
- Look, I came here

09:32.088 --> 09:34.263
because Grey-Sloan's supposed
to be the best.

09:34.263 --> 09:36.230
So please, you gotta help me.

09:36.230 --> 09:37.784
It could be
a positive McBurney sign.

09:37.784 --> 09:39.164
Which could be caused by...

09:39.164 --> 09:40.510
- Appendicitis.
- Diverticulitis.

09:42.754 --> 09:44.998
Yo!
What the hell?

09:44.998 --> 09:45.964
I was seeing if the pain
was exacerbated

09:45.964 --> 09:47.069
by jostling movements.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.588
Can we wait to play school

09:48.588 --> 09:50.244
until I'm not in agony?

09:50.244 --> 09:51.729
Let's get him comfortable.

09:51.729 --> 09:53.351
We'll send him up
for the basic labs,

09:53.351 --> 09:55.664
and then let's take him up
to CT for some scans.

10:03.154 --> 10:04.914
Did I hear correctly, a bull?

10:04.914 --> 10:07.192
T-bird.
He's feisty.

10:07.192 --> 10:09.470
I just didn't get out
over his front end in time.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.438
When T-bird trampled
over Georgia,

10:11.438 --> 10:13.647
he crushed her liver
and likely tore her IVC.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.305
There's a big hematoma
in the retrohepatic space,

10:16.305 --> 10:19.342
which it looks contained
for now, stable HNH.

10:19.342 --> 10:22.138
She's got unstable T10
through L3 burst fractures.

10:22.138 --> 10:23.657
Please don't tell my parents.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.107
They freak out whenever
stuff like this happens.

10:25.107 --> 10:27.109
This has happened before?

10:27.109 --> 10:30.112
I had a huge cut on my back,
a broken wrist, a broken leg.

10:30.112 --> 10:32.148
Oh, and I have
this massive scar.

10:32.148 --> 10:34.288
- Whoa, whoa!
- Push two of midazolam.

10:34.288 --> 10:37.050
Okay, this burst L3 fracture
is too unstable.

10:37.050 --> 10:39.190
Without immediate surgery,
we're talking about paralysis.

10:39.190 --> 10:41.571
Once Maggie goes in
and repairs the IVC,

10:41.571 --> 10:43.056
I will stabilize the spine.

10:43.056 --> 10:44.678
I don't think I should go in.

10:44.678 --> 10:45.990
There's a massive hematoma.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.198
And it's sitting
in a minefield.

10:47.198 --> 10:48.544
The hematoma is stable for now.

10:48.544 --> 10:50.339
But you should go in
and repair the spine,

10:50.339 --> 10:52.065
and I will be there
to monitor her.

10:52.065 --> 10:54.239
Just use a posterior approach
to avoid rupturing it.

10:54.239 --> 10:55.862
What if it happens anyway?

10:55.862 --> 10:57.035
Then we'll flip her,

10:57.035 --> 10:58.519
and I will control
the bleeding.

10:58.519 --> 11:00.004
No, I'm not sure
I should go in.

11:00.004 --> 11:02.592
If you don't,
she never walks again.

11:02.592 --> 11:04.077
Are Georgia's parents here?

11:06.458 --> 11:08.702
Look.
All I need is antibiotics.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.670
It'll clear up
in a few days or so.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.568
Maybe.

11:12.568 --> 11:15.088
But I am hearing
some wheezing in the left lung.

11:15.088 --> 11:16.745
Okay.

11:16.745 --> 11:18.678
We should get a chest X-ray,
make sure

11:18.678 --> 11:19.989
we're not looking at pneumonia.

11:19.989 --> 11:22.578
No.
No chest X-ray.

11:22.578 --> 11:24.166
There's no
discomfort involved.

11:24.166 --> 11:26.030
Until the bill comes.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.931
When my husband died,
I was lucky enough

11:30.931 --> 11:33.002
to find work in a bookstore.

11:33.002 --> 11:34.694
It's lovely.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.525
The owner is kind,
but low wages and no--

11:38.525 --> 11:40.354
No benefits.

11:40.354 --> 11:42.253
Without the X-ray,
I can't tell

11:42.253 --> 11:43.633
how serious this is, so--

11:43.633 --> 11:46.740
I can hardly afford antibiotics.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.122
Anything else
is out of the question.

11:49.122 --> 11:52.125
Look, I'll get you
the antibiotics,

11:52.125 --> 11:54.748
but just stay here.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.094
Okay?
I'll be right back.

11:56.094 --> 11:57.475
<i>Dr. Sutton, Dr. Tracy,</i>

11:57.475 --> 11:58.476
<i>psych to recovery.</i>

11:58.476 --> 12:01.375
<i>Dr. Sutton to recovery.</i>

12:01.375 --> 12:03.308
He didn't even tell me
he was leaving.

12:03.308 --> 12:05.138
He insinuated
that I wouldn't care

12:05.138 --> 12:07.278
because I only cared
about the sex.

12:07.278 --> 12:08.935
I didn't use him for sex.

12:08.935 --> 12:12.559
He used me for sex,
and then he left.

12:12.559 --> 12:13.905
I'm the victim here.

12:13.905 --> 12:15.389
You're the doctor.
He's the nurse.

12:15.389 --> 12:17.081
You've got all the power.

12:17.081 --> 12:18.979
You clearly don't understand
gay male culture.

12:18.979 --> 12:20.463
He's hotter.

12:20.463 --> 12:21.913
He has all the power.

12:21.913 --> 12:23.397
Doesn't sound
like he felt that way.

12:23.397 --> 12:25.054
Why aren't you sad for me?

12:25.054 --> 12:27.954
I'm the nice guy
who, once again, got left.

12:27.954 --> 12:29.818
Well, the interns
who have come in here

12:29.818 --> 12:31.647
after working and being
yelled at for 16 hours

12:31.647 --> 12:32.959
definitely don't feel
like you're the nice guy.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.168
I don't yell!

12:35.168 --> 12:36.307
That wasn't yelling.

12:36.307 --> 12:37.791
That was loud talking.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.137
I'm nice.

12:44.522 --> 12:47.490
I love you.
I mean it.

12:47.490 --> 12:50.493
If the hematoma ruptures
while you're fixing the spine,

12:50.493 --> 12:51.667
she could die.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.151
But if it doesn't rupture,

12:53.151 --> 12:55.326
it could heal on its own?
- That's right.

12:55.326 --> 12:59.295
The safest option is to just
monitor Georgia in the ICU.

12:59.295 --> 13:01.953
She may not walk again,
but she would be alive.

13:01.953 --> 13:04.645
Sounds like this thing
could rupture any time.

13:04.645 --> 13:06.371
I mean, hell, it could be
rupturing right now.

13:06.371 --> 13:07.821
Cody...
She...

13:07.821 --> 13:10.824
He's not wrong.

13:19.039 --> 13:21.386
Do the spinal surgery.

13:21.386 --> 13:23.112
Sir, I wanna make sure
that you understand--

13:23.112 --> 13:24.700
We do.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.771
Save our daughter's ability
to ride.

13:30.879 --> 13:33.364
No stranding,
appendix looks normal.

13:33.364 --> 13:35.849
No evidence of colitis.

13:35.849 --> 13:39.197
That's an awfully quick
assessment, Adams.

13:39.197 --> 13:42.545
You know, scans are
like a piece of art,

13:42.545 --> 13:44.306
a still life, say.

13:44.306 --> 13:47.136
Maybe you first look
at it and you shrug.

13:47.136 --> 13:49.207
Looks like a pear, or tulip.

13:49.207 --> 13:50.899
But you sit with it
for a while,

13:50.899 --> 13:52.590
learn to open up your mind,

13:52.590 --> 13:55.524
and maybe it might guide
your eye

13:55.524 --> 13:58.699
to something that the artist
wants you to see.

13:58.699 --> 14:00.253
Hold up.

14:00.253 --> 14:01.910
It turns out Seth's been
to five different Seattle ERs

14:01.910 --> 14:03.532
in the past three weeks,

14:03.532 --> 14:06.949
all discharged with a script
for controlled pain meds.

14:08.917 --> 14:11.195
Seattle Pres,
two nights, Pacific Gen, one,

14:11.195 --> 14:12.886
St. Anne's, two hours.
- Okay.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.094
I get what you're implying.

14:14.094 --> 14:15.682
And according
to their records,

14:15.682 --> 14:17.684
you have a history of drug use

14:17.684 --> 14:19.928
that you didn't bother
to tell us about.

14:19.928 --> 14:21.791
We can't help you if you're
not telling the truth.

14:21.791 --> 14:24.173
Oh, my God.
I--I don't have--

14:27.245 --> 14:29.385
Back in the day,
I did Adderall to stay up.

14:29.385 --> 14:30.904
I'm a private equity analyst.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.216
All-nighters go
with the territory

14:32.216 --> 14:33.355
when you're starting out.

14:33.355 --> 14:34.943
But I haven't done it in years.

14:34.943 --> 14:36.461
And I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you

14:36.461 --> 14:37.877
to write me off like
all those other hospitals.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.188
We're not writing you off.

14:39.188 --> 14:40.603
Addiction is a disease.

14:40.603 --> 14:42.019
It's a disease I don't have.

14:42.019 --> 14:44.021
And your scans are clean.

14:44.021 --> 14:45.229
And I got on the phone
with colleagues

14:45.229 --> 14:46.540
of those other hospitals,

14:46.540 --> 14:48.715
who also found nothing
on your scans.

14:48.715 --> 14:50.441
Maybe they didn't sit
long enough with the scans.

14:50.441 --> 14:52.236
These aren't interns, Adams.

14:52.236 --> 14:53.306
These are world-class surgeons

14:53.306 --> 14:54.928
with decades of experience.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.274
So you're just gonna
kick me out on the street

14:56.274 --> 14:57.655
like everyone else?

14:57.655 --> 14:59.105
No, we are gonna exercise
our due diligence

14:59.105 --> 15:00.623
and take extra tests,

15:00.623 --> 15:02.591
and if they show nothing,
then we will discharge you

15:02.591 --> 15:04.765
with a referral
to an addiction specialist.

15:04.765 --> 15:08.321
I should never have admitted
I ever used drugs.

15:08.321 --> 15:10.875
You screw up once,
you're a screw-up forever.

15:23.612 --> 15:28.341
She's about
prepped and ready.

15:28.341 --> 15:31.068
Why didn't you tell me
about all the job offers?

15:31.068 --> 15:32.966
Offers come in
every time I publish.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.106
Happens to everyone.
- Not like this.

15:35.106 --> 15:37.971
Look, it doesn't matter
where you are, right?

15:37.971 --> 15:40.249
I mean, it matters
what you're doing.

15:40.249 --> 15:41.630
If you just ask
Teddy or Richard

15:41.630 --> 15:43.183
for whatever you need
research-wise,

15:43.183 --> 15:44.667
they will get it for you.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.084
You don't have to move
to do your next big thing.

15:47.084 --> 15:48.464
Meredith and I managed
to pull off

15:48.464 --> 15:51.502
the Parkinson's procedure
right down the hall.

15:51.502 --> 15:53.987
She's ready.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.230
All right.

15:59.234 --> 16:00.994
So when you all told me
about those 8:30

16:00.994 --> 16:03.169
surgical study sessions,
what time were they really?

16:08.519 --> 16:09.623
What do you think

16:09.623 --> 16:11.108
about Chilaiditi syndrome
for Seth?

16:11.108 --> 16:12.661
Thinking it's
usually associated

16:12.661 --> 16:14.214
with ascitic
and cirrhotic patients.

16:14.214 --> 16:15.871
Also, we would have
seen it in the scans.

16:15.871 --> 16:17.804
And we have our answer.

16:17.804 --> 16:19.012
All those tests came back
clean, except his urinalysis,

16:19.012 --> 16:20.393
which is positive for opiates.

16:20.393 --> 16:22.326
Because all those other
hospitals gave him meds.

16:22.326 --> 16:23.396
Webber said to discharge him.

16:23.396 --> 16:25.536
I'm gonna discharge him.

16:25.536 --> 16:28.573
Tessa Hobbes.

16:28.573 --> 16:31.680
Why would you bring up Tessa?
You know that still hurts.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.130
Because my gut told me
that we should have taken her

16:33.130 --> 16:34.545
straight to the OR.

16:34.545 --> 16:36.719
You heard me say it,
but I didn't fight for it.

16:36.719 --> 16:38.687
And now my gut's saying
that Seth's telling the truth.

16:38.687 --> 16:40.344
Nothing I've seen makes me
think Webber's wrong.

16:40.344 --> 16:41.517
Yeah, but do you think
there might be

16:41.517 --> 16:43.174
a chance that I'm right?

16:43.174 --> 16:44.589
I mean, I've always
had your back.

16:44.589 --> 16:46.350
Could you at least have mine?

16:51.700 --> 16:52.839
I'm already
on my second residency.

16:52.839 --> 16:57.016
He's not gonna fire us.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.672
Have suction ready.

16:58.672 --> 17:00.088
Blood pressure's steady.

17:01.951 --> 17:04.885
Chief, I have a wheezing
60-year-old patient in the ER,

17:04.885 --> 17:06.542
possible pneumonia.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.613
She needs a chest X-ray
and a nebulizer treatment,

17:08.613 --> 17:10.926
but can't afford it.
Can we do it pro bono?

17:10.926 --> 17:12.928
You'll have to fill out
the forms with accounting.

17:12.928 --> 17:14.274
They're gonna want
to confirm her income

17:14.274 --> 17:15.275
and make sure
that she qualifies.

17:15.275 --> 17:16.518
It may take a day or so.

17:16.518 --> 17:18.175
But she needs
to be treated now.

17:18.175 --> 17:19.969
If we break the rules
for one patient,

17:19.969 --> 17:21.419
it's not fair for the others.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.459
I was eating doughnuts
from the trash

17:26.459 --> 17:28.702
because I need to gain weight
in order to be eligible

17:28.702 --> 17:30.221
to donate my plasma because
I am broke.

17:30.221 --> 17:32.085
So is my patient.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.259
I don't need your help,

17:33.259 --> 17:34.777
and I am not looking
for handouts.

17:34.777 --> 17:36.227
I just want to take care
of my patient.

17:36.227 --> 17:37.884
I'm sorry.

17:37.884 --> 17:41.405
You have to go
through the proper channels.

17:41.405 --> 17:45.719
Yasuda, I have
protein bars in my office.

17:45.719 --> 17:47.963
You're welcome
to them any time.

17:47.963 --> 17:49.413
<i>Removing the lamina.</i>

17:49.413 --> 17:51.553
Can't stop thinking
about that father.

17:51.553 --> 17:54.314
I'm reconstructing a spine just
to have her go back out there

17:54.314 --> 17:55.798
and wreck it all over again.

17:55.798 --> 17:57.110
Yeah, lots of parents

17:57.110 --> 17:58.663
live out their fantasies
through their kids.

17:58.663 --> 18:00.803
So her last shock panel
showed a hemoglobin of 11.

18:00.803 --> 18:02.426
So the bleed is stable.

18:02.426 --> 18:04.945
Just be careful
with your instrumentation.

18:04.945 --> 18:06.982
I'm not sure you hovering
is gonna make things

18:06.982 --> 18:08.673
go more smoothly.

18:08.673 --> 18:10.606
How many times have we
fixed up a pro football player

18:10.606 --> 18:12.160
just so he can go back out
in the field in the hopes

18:12.160 --> 18:13.506
of making the playoffs?

18:13.506 --> 18:15.232
Don't get me started
on football.

18:15.232 --> 18:16.819
Except rodeo is the only gig

18:16.819 --> 18:18.511
with a poor animal
out there against their will.

18:18.511 --> 18:20.029
It's cruel.
- Can we keep

18:20.029 --> 18:21.859
all nonessential chatter
to a minimum?

18:21.859 --> 18:23.964
Georgia has a giant bleed
hanging over her

18:23.964 --> 18:26.139
that could burst in any second.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.175
Pedicle screw, please.

18:31.489 --> 18:33.629
I think it's a connection.
I think--

18:33.629 --> 18:36.287
Adams, Griffith!

18:36.287 --> 18:37.840
Is everything okay,
Dr. Schmidt?

18:37.840 --> 18:40.464
Just checking in
on how you two are doing.

18:40.464 --> 18:43.122
How's life?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.675
What's up?

18:44.675 --> 18:45.779
I don't understand.

18:45.779 --> 18:48.541
What are you working on?

18:48.541 --> 18:50.957
Okay, we--we know
Webber said to discharge him.

18:50.957 --> 18:53.615
But we really think

18:53.615 --> 18:56.031
that there's something more
to this patient.

18:56.031 --> 18:57.619
And if we could just have
a little more time

18:57.619 --> 18:58.792
to study his case,
we can figure it out.

18:58.792 --> 18:59.897
Okay.
No.

18:59.897 --> 19:01.070
You're interns.

19:01.070 --> 19:03.003
It doesn't matter
what you think.

19:03.003 --> 19:05.558
If you can't be trusted
to follow instructions,

19:05.558 --> 19:07.491
then you can't be trusted
in the OR.

19:07.491 --> 19:10.149
Discharge the patient.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.978
And never question
Dr. Webber ever again.

19:26.613 --> 19:30.307
I should probably go to work
and check on Tia.

19:30.307 --> 19:32.688
Tia and her baby
are both okay.

19:32.688 --> 19:35.553
I've checked.

19:35.553 --> 19:37.555
A car drove into human beings

19:37.555 --> 19:39.212
and tried to kill you
and your friends.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.420
You've earned a day off.

19:43.527 --> 19:47.496
Why is it so hard
for me to rest?

19:47.496 --> 19:51.742
How am I supposed
to know that?

19:51.742 --> 19:54.331
Because you knew
that I wasn't sick

19:54.331 --> 19:55.918
before I even knew
that I wasn't sick.

19:55.918 --> 19:57.334
I've known you a long time.

19:57.334 --> 19:58.921
You notice things
about somebody

19:58.921 --> 20:01.130
when you've known them
a long time.

20:01.130 --> 20:03.443
You knew what
my favorite doughnuts were.

20:03.443 --> 20:04.893
Same answer.

20:04.893 --> 20:07.344
So why is it
so hard for me to rest?

20:07.344 --> 20:08.862
You don't have a theory?

20:08.862 --> 20:11.934
I could tell you why I think

20:11.934 --> 20:13.246
it's hard for me to rest.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.937
Would that help?

20:14.937 --> 20:18.044
Yes, please.

20:18.044 --> 20:22.600
Well, I was
a pretty happy go-lucky kid.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.707
I got cancer, and my parents
started to fight all the time.

20:25.707 --> 20:31.471
And I was sick, stuck in bed,
listening to my parents fight

20:31.471 --> 20:33.059
through the walls.

20:33.059 --> 20:36.027
So I think I associate rest
with misery.

20:38.754 --> 20:41.067
I don't think that's it.

20:41.067 --> 20:42.379
Okay.

20:42.379 --> 20:44.104
You know me better
than I know me.

20:44.104 --> 20:45.451
I've known you a long time,

20:45.451 --> 20:46.797
and when you've known someone
a long time,

20:46.797 --> 20:47.798
you notice things.

20:50.352 --> 20:52.423
So what do you think it is?

20:52.423 --> 20:56.565
I think you only have
trouble resting

20:56.565 --> 20:59.465
when you're not taking care
of somebody else.

20:59.465 --> 21:02.640
You'll lay around all day
with a baby on your chest

21:02.640 --> 21:05.298
if that baby needs you.

21:05.298 --> 21:10.752
You lay in bed with me
with doughnuts if I need you.

21:10.752 --> 21:12.754
And when you got cancer

21:12.754 --> 21:15.619
and your parents
started fighting,

21:15.619 --> 21:17.345
you started
to take care of them

21:17.345 --> 21:19.933
so they wouldn't split up.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.763
You learned
to take emotional care

21:21.763 --> 21:23.937
of the people who are supposed
to be taking care of you.

21:23.937 --> 21:25.801
And that's why
it's hard for you to rest

21:25.801 --> 21:28.114
when you're by yourself.

21:28.114 --> 21:29.978
You don't feel safe
when you're not

21:29.978 --> 21:33.119
taking care of somebody else.

21:33.119 --> 21:34.879
That makes you anxious.

21:44.682 --> 21:49.825
And I think you can't rest

21:49.825 --> 21:53.622
because you never had
anyone to take care of you.

21:53.622 --> 21:56.211
So you stayed busy all
the time

21:56.211 --> 21:58.386
taking care of yourself.

21:58.386 --> 22:00.077
And when you're still,
you feel that pain.

22:08.396 --> 22:10.363
I need a nap.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.986
Want me to go?

22:12.986 --> 22:14.885
No.

22:21.754 --> 22:23.687
That feels nice.

22:33.869 --> 22:39.496
Harborview Med,
last Tuesday, 2311, nothing.

22:39.496 --> 22:41.532
If Webber or Schmidt
finds us, we're fired.

22:41.532 --> 22:42.947
Yeah, well--

22:45.709 --> 22:48.850
You'd think
that'd be annoying.

22:48.850 --> 22:52.371
It clears my mind,
helps me unwind.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.579
You have anything like that?

22:53.579 --> 22:54.545
Ice skating.

22:57.065 --> 22:58.618
What?

22:58.618 --> 23:00.448
I just--
I wasn't expecting that.

23:00.448 --> 23:04.555
Well, you don't know
everything about me.

23:04.555 --> 23:05.763
True.

23:05.763 --> 23:07.247
I never pictured you
as the type

23:07.247 --> 23:10.527
to have a big fancy wedding
or matching dresses.

23:10.527 --> 23:12.805
I don't want either.

23:12.805 --> 23:17.913
I want the marriage, but not
the pomp and circumstance.

23:17.913 --> 23:21.434
Not even a little pomp,
like meat on a stick

23:21.434 --> 23:24.230
or chucking a bouquet
at your girls, group pics?

23:24.230 --> 23:29.338
I truly hate you.

23:29.338 --> 23:30.823
I think it's sweet
that Trey wants

23:30.823 --> 23:32.549
to create a moment in our lives

23:32.549 --> 23:34.067
that we're gonna remember forever.

23:34.067 --> 23:35.586
But he's a romantic.

23:35.586 --> 23:37.450
Even when we're just out
getting pizza,

23:37.450 --> 23:38.727
he's like, "I wish I could
freeze this moment forever."

23:38.727 --> 23:39.970
Oh, wait. Wait. Wait.

23:39.970 --> 23:42.110
That's it.

23:42.110 --> 23:43.767
Moments--that's...

23:43.767 --> 23:45.251
Okay.

23:45.251 --> 23:46.666
These scans--
they're not works of art.

23:46.666 --> 23:48.254
They're--they're moments.

23:48.254 --> 23:51.360
They're frozen moments in time.

23:54.398 --> 23:56.504
Oh, good.
Glad we cleared that up.

23:56.504 --> 23:58.471
Okay, look.
Here we go.

23:58.471 --> 23:59.817
There and there...

24:03.062 --> 24:05.789
Do you know where they came
up with the eight seconds

24:05.789 --> 24:08.516
as the time the rider
has to stay on the bull?

24:08.516 --> 24:10.449
It's because the bull starts
to lose its strength

24:10.449 --> 24:12.589
to fight back
and they stop bucking.

24:12.589 --> 24:15.350
The official line is that it's
for the safety of the animals,

24:15.350 --> 24:17.386
but it's really because
they become so weakened

24:17.386 --> 24:19.043
that we stop being entertained.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.184
BP's dropping.

24:22.184 --> 24:23.531
Pierce, is that
what I think it is?

24:23.531 --> 24:24.946
She's bleeding out.

24:24.946 --> 24:26.499
The hematoma ruptured.
Stop the fusion.

24:26.499 --> 24:27.776
We need to flip her.
- Her spine is exposed.

24:27.776 --> 24:29.226
It doesn't matter.

24:29.226 --> 24:30.399
Pack it and throw
some ioban on it.

24:30.399 --> 24:31.642
Hang 2 units of blood.

24:31.642 --> 24:33.472
Prep for an x-flap
and a sternotomy.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.059
Every second counts
here, people.

24:35.059 --> 24:36.336
Until we get
this bleed stopped,

24:36.336 --> 24:37.372
this is my OR.

24:58.738 --> 25:00.257
Okay.
This is it.

25:00.257 --> 25:02.052
When we get in there, Kwan,
you're gonna alternate

25:02.052 --> 25:04.537
cardiac massage with Millin.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.815
Scalpel.

25:06.815 --> 25:10.819
Okay, Georgia, here we go.

25:10.819 --> 25:12.407
Scalpel.

25:12.407 --> 25:16.549
<i>♪ I've been looking

25:16.549 --> 25:19.863

25:19.863 --> 25:22.521

25:22.521 --> 25:25.454
Starting pressors.

25:25.454 --> 25:27.560
<i>♪ Set me free</i>

25:40.711 --> 25:42.782
Send a TEG.

25:49.099 --> 25:51.101
She's becoming more acidotic.

25:51.101 --> 25:52.585
We can't lose her.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.138
I need more suction.

25:54.138 --> 25:56.382
<i>Still no pulse.</i>

25:56.382 --> 25:59.765

26:18.922 --> 26:20.820
Okay, I've got
the infrahepatic IVC

26:20.820 --> 26:22.960
and Pringle.
Lap pads.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.584
I've got the cava
and the pericardium.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.826
Millin, switch with Kwan.

26:26.826 --> 26:28.517
We've maxed out
on her pressors.

26:28.517 --> 26:30.174
- Pickups?
- Still no pulse.

26:30.174 --> 26:31.728
I feel the heart.
I'm there.

26:31.728 --> 26:34.282
I see
the hepatic vein injury.

26:42.497 --> 26:46.121
Ligating, push epi.

26:46.121 --> 26:48.365
Packing
the retrohepatic space.

26:48.365 --> 26:50.850
Come on, Georgia.

26:50.850 --> 26:53.473
<i>♪ Set me free</i>

26:53.473 --> 26:55.993
The nurse
brought the antibiotics

26:55.993 --> 26:58.133
and the inhaler.
I'm off to my shift.

26:58.133 --> 26:59.445
Please don't go
before getting an X-ray

26:59.445 --> 27:00.688
and the nebulizer treatment.

27:00.688 --> 27:01.930
We could do it pro bono,

27:01.930 --> 27:03.656
but we just need
to fill these forms out.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.140
If I miss work,
I don't get paid.

27:05.140 --> 27:06.659
And if I don't get paid--

27:06.659 --> 27:08.005
You can't pay your bills.
I get it.

27:08.005 --> 27:09.110
- No--
- But--

27:09.110 --> 27:11.112
No, you don't.

27:11.112 --> 27:13.666
You're a doctor
with a cushy salary.

27:13.666 --> 27:16.358
Well, I am a surgical intern.

27:16.358 --> 27:19.051
My salary is government funded,
and it is not enough

27:19.051 --> 27:20.673
to keep me from drowning
in loans.

27:20.673 --> 27:21.985
Between undergrad
and med school,

27:21.985 --> 27:23.676
I owe more
than two grand a month.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.471
That doesn't even account
for what I send to my parents

27:25.471 --> 27:26.817
to help them
with their mortgage payment

27:26.817 --> 27:28.647
because they co-signed
all of my loans.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.408
I literally sell my blood
in order to get by.

27:31.408 --> 27:32.720
And if I thought that I had
pneumonia that could lead

27:32.720 --> 27:34.376
to sepsis
and respiratory failure

27:34.376 --> 27:36.378
that could prove fatal
if left untreated,

27:36.378 --> 27:37.586
or, at the very least,

27:37.586 --> 27:39.002
keep me out of work
for eight weeks,

27:39.002 --> 27:42.419
I would get the X-ray
and the treatment.

27:42.419 --> 27:44.490
And when the bill came,
I would pay the bare minimum.

27:44.490 --> 27:45.974
And if it went
to the collection agencies,

27:45.974 --> 27:48.252
I would pay them
the bare minimum too.

27:48.252 --> 27:51.152
And it might be
a huge, long, pain in the ass,

27:51.152 --> 27:52.636
but I would be alive.

27:57.848 --> 28:00.023
Where do I go
for the chest X-ray?

28:06.961 --> 28:11.241
Pick it up, guys,
a little faster.

28:11.241 --> 28:14.071
You know what they called me
when I was chief resident?

28:14.071 --> 28:15.383
The Nazi.

28:15.383 --> 28:16.867
That is wildly inappropriate...

28:16.867 --> 28:19.698
- Yes.
- On so many levels.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.252
I mean, I wasn't
a tough child,

28:22.252 --> 28:23.598
not in the obvious ways.

28:23.598 --> 28:26.463
I was sensitive
all through high school

28:26.463 --> 28:28.637
and undergrad and med school.

28:28.637 --> 28:31.848
So as a resident,
even more so as chief resident,

28:31.848 --> 28:34.954
I thought I had
to overcompensate.

28:34.954 --> 28:37.888
And for a while,
I became someone

28:37.888 --> 28:42.065
people didn't like very much.

28:42.065 --> 28:43.929
And what did you do?

28:43.929 --> 28:47.726
Well, I realized
that my idea of myself

28:47.726 --> 28:51.799
had come out of sync
with who I had become.

28:51.799 --> 28:54.491
Schmidt, you are
chief resident now.

28:54.491 --> 28:56.217
You are no longer an underdog.

28:56.217 --> 28:58.875
It's time for you to stop
seeing yourself that way.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.497
You're saying
I shouldn't demand

29:00.497 --> 29:02.085
excellence from the interns?

29:02.085 --> 29:04.294
I'm saying there's
many ways to do that.

29:04.294 --> 29:06.261
And the one that will work
best for you

29:06.261 --> 29:09.057
is likely the one
that lets you be you.

29:09.057 --> 29:12.751
I mean, you said you want us
to be the vagina of the program

29:12.751 --> 29:15.098
because vaginas are so strong.

29:15.098 --> 29:18.411
Well, vaginas
also bring pleasure.

29:18.411 --> 29:21.621
They bring joy, bring life.

29:21.621 --> 29:25.625
You got to be the whole vagina,
Schmidt, not just the muscle.

29:31.183 --> 29:33.254
It's like we were staring
at a single cell of film

29:33.254 --> 29:34.600
and trying to watch a movie.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.119
We have to look
at all the scans

29:36.119 --> 29:38.777
in order to see
if they tell a story.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.366
Okay, look--
look here, four to five.

29:42.366 --> 29:44.610
There's a slight thickening
in the cecal wall here.

29:44.610 --> 29:47.509
Yeah?
And then six and seven--

29:47.509 --> 29:49.511
No more thickening,
but mild fat stranding.

29:49.511 --> 29:51.134
Yeah.

29:51.134 --> 29:55.517
And then eight, nine, ten,
the pattern reappears.

29:55.517 --> 29:57.209
The flare-ups come and go,

29:57.209 --> 29:59.832
but the CT scans only capture
one moment in time.

29:59.832 --> 30:01.938
Now our little film
tells a different story.

30:01.938 --> 30:03.318
I mean, there's
gotta be something in there,

30:03.318 --> 30:05.493
a foreign object
causing these reactions.

30:05.493 --> 30:08.392
Like a fish bone, maybe,
or a piece of cartilage

30:08.392 --> 30:09.842
that wasn't digested properly?

30:09.842 --> 30:11.464
You want to tell me
why the patient

30:11.464 --> 30:15.192
I told you to discharge hours
ago is still stuck in my ER?

30:18.437 --> 30:21.405
So she's gonna be okay?

30:21.405 --> 30:22.890
Uh, yeah.

30:22.890 --> 30:25.858
Georgia did well
under the circumstances,

30:25.858 --> 30:28.343
against all odds.

30:28.343 --> 30:29.517
But we would like
to speak with you

30:29.517 --> 30:31.139
about the bull riding.

30:31.139 --> 30:34.039
I should wait for my husband.

30:34.039 --> 30:37.042
We would like to have
a minute with just you.

30:37.042 --> 30:38.181
Oh.

30:41.909 --> 30:46.154
Georgia's father,
her grandfather, her uncles--

30:46.154 --> 30:48.432
they are all champion riders.

30:48.432 --> 30:51.780
But Cody never wanted Georgia
to go near a bull.

30:51.780 --> 30:55.543
Every Christmas,
he would give her

30:55.543 --> 31:00.065
a dollhouse,
ballet slippers, a soccer ball.

31:00.065 --> 31:01.445
She wouldn't touch them.

31:01.445 --> 31:05.104
She wanted boots,
spurs, a saddle.

31:05.104 --> 31:07.072
Cody thought when she
took her first spill,

31:07.072 --> 31:10.109
she'd lose interest, but...

31:10.109 --> 31:12.422
but when she got laid up
with a crushed trachea,

31:12.422 --> 31:14.734
we said no more.

31:14.734 --> 31:16.875
Guess what?
She wouldn't eat,

31:16.875 --> 31:19.912
wouldn't speak, couldn't sleep.

31:19.912 --> 31:24.572
The light in her eyes
was just gone.

31:24.572 --> 31:27.782
To keep doing this
will very likely kill her.

31:27.782 --> 31:29.611
You think I don't worry
about that

31:29.611 --> 31:32.235
every single day of my life?

31:32.235 --> 31:35.307
But to take her dream
away from her--

31:35.307 --> 31:37.896
that would for sure kill her.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.069
Excuse me.

31:39.069 --> 31:40.174
I'm gonna go find my husband.

31:44.592 --> 31:45.834
Nothing is harder
than parenting,

31:45.834 --> 31:48.147
but you have to be the parent.

31:48.147 --> 31:50.046
Would it have worked on you

31:50.046 --> 31:51.944
when you were a teenager doing
hard drugs,

31:51.944 --> 31:54.291
risking your life?

31:54.291 --> 31:56.052
Was your mom able to stop you?

31:56.052 --> 31:57.570
I was using drugs to mask

31:57.570 --> 32:00.677
some very real pain in my life.

32:00.677 --> 32:02.472
Maybe it's
the same for Georgia.

32:02.472 --> 32:04.508
Maybe she's masking the pain
of having found

32:04.508 --> 32:06.303
her one true passion

32:06.303 --> 32:07.995
and hearing everyone around her

32:07.995 --> 32:12.068
tell her that she is selfish
for chasing it.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.002
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Georgia, no.

32:15.002 --> 32:16.348
She's pulling the tube out.

32:16.348 --> 32:18.937
Increase her O2
and draw an ABG.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.352
Hey.

32:20.352 --> 32:21.870
Georgia, you're okay.
Just take a breath.

32:27.497 --> 32:28.705
Georgia, calm down.
I need you to put this mask on.

32:28.705 --> 32:30.155
Your body needs
additional oxygen.

32:30.155 --> 32:31.984
I've had kids
self-extubate before.

32:31.984 --> 32:34.021
Instinct and adrenaline
kick in.

32:34.021 --> 32:35.815
How long--
how long will it take?

32:35.815 --> 32:39.302
You will be up and walking
in four to six weeks.

32:39.302 --> 32:40.889
Ride.

32:40.889 --> 32:43.133
Georgia, going back
to rodeo would be a mistake.

32:43.133 --> 32:45.135
Most people do not survive
the surgery

32:45.135 --> 32:46.205
that Dr. Pierce just did.

32:46.205 --> 32:47.827
I'm not most people!

32:47.827 --> 32:50.865
Would you be saying
the same thing if I was a guy?

32:50.865 --> 32:52.694
Georgia, I'm not
like most people either.

32:52.694 --> 32:55.111
I was really good at something
when I was your age too.

32:55.111 --> 32:57.009
I skipped grades,
I won prizes,

32:57.009 --> 32:58.114
and everybody thought it was
my parents

32:58.114 --> 32:59.218
that were pushing me,
but it was me.

32:59.218 --> 33:00.288
It was all me.

33:00.288 --> 33:01.980
So I get your focus.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.705
I get your passion.

33:03.705 --> 33:04.810
And I certainly get
what it's like to be

33:04.810 --> 33:06.294
a girl in an all-guys' world.

33:06.294 --> 33:08.296
Maybe you'll ride
again someday.

33:08.296 --> 33:10.574
But a few hours ago, you were
almost dead and paralyzed.

33:10.574 --> 33:13.198
Stop fighting us and let us
save the possibility

33:13.198 --> 33:15.338
of your future.

33:19.445 --> 33:20.860
There's the ileocecal valve.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.828
I hope we didn't
just put a tube

33:22.828 --> 33:24.864
into a patient for no reason.

33:24.864 --> 33:27.039
Whoa, whoa, what's that
in the distal ileum?

33:27.039 --> 33:30.767
Move the camera
down and left.

33:30.767 --> 33:33.183
- There!
- Is that a--

33:33.183 --> 33:35.082
Toothpick.
I'll be damned.

33:35.082 --> 33:36.773
Oh, my God.

33:36.773 --> 33:38.775
How did it not shred
his esophagus on the way down?

33:38.775 --> 33:40.708
Well, it perfed the bowel.

33:40.708 --> 33:43.021
Then it impacted
into the intestinal wall,

33:43.021 --> 33:45.333
where it hid
from the scanner's radar.

33:45.333 --> 33:47.059
Adams, what's the game plan?

33:47.059 --> 33:50.028
Use the endoscopy forceps
to fish it out carefully.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.099
Being careful not to break it
and leave a piece behind

33:52.099 --> 33:53.893
that could cause
an abscess later.

33:57.207 --> 33:58.864
All right, hold it steady.

33:58.864 --> 34:00.728
Will this take away
all of this pain?

34:00.728 --> 34:02.074
It absolutely will.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.593
Almost there.

34:08.218 --> 34:09.564
Incredible save, Adams.

34:18.780 --> 34:19.954
Incredible save.

34:22.922 --> 34:24.890
Have I mentioned
that I had my hand

34:24.890 --> 34:26.616
on an actual beating heart?

34:26.616 --> 34:28.825
Only about six times.

34:28.825 --> 34:31.207
But hey, I heard you found
a bobby pin in some guy's ass

34:31.207 --> 34:33.933
or something, so also cool.

34:33.933 --> 34:35.935
I convinced a patient
to get a chest X-ray.

34:35.935 --> 34:37.765
Hey, congratulations, Adams.

34:37.765 --> 34:39.560
Yasuda's day was
sadder than yours.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.079
Yeah.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.460
Hey, thanks
for everything today.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.290
If you need anything,
I got your back.

34:47.844 --> 34:49.156
I do need something.

34:49.156 --> 34:50.778
I know this might be weird,

34:50.778 --> 34:52.435
and if it's still hard
for you, you can say no.

34:52.435 --> 34:55.265
But you know me
better than anyone here,

34:55.265 --> 34:58.165
better than anyone
at my old program, actually.

34:58.165 --> 35:01.340
And I could really use a friend
to help me get through this.

35:04.447 --> 35:06.656
I'm asking you
to be my man of honor.

35:12.144 --> 35:15.803
Yeah, of course.

35:15.803 --> 35:16.735
It'd be an honor.

35:18.702 --> 35:19.703
Thank you.

35:19.703 --> 35:22.775
Hey, everyone,

35:22.775 --> 35:25.157
I want you to know
I heard you all did

35:25.157 --> 35:27.849
some incredible work today.

35:27.849 --> 35:30.058
And so, if you're up for it,
I would like to invite

35:30.058 --> 35:32.026
you all out for drinks.

35:34.615 --> 35:35.547
I'm actually serious.

35:37.100 --> 35:40.172
- Uh, oh.
- So just, you know,

35:40.172 --> 35:41.656
meet me at Joe's.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.730
- Free drinks.
- Yeah.

35:51.045 --> 35:53.185
Any chance you need
another bartender?

35:53.185 --> 35:54.807
When would you sleep?

35:54.807 --> 35:56.430
I'd figure it out.

35:57.879 --> 35:59.329
Uh, yeah, yeah.

35:59.329 --> 36:01.228
The manager is hiring
for the late shift.

36:01.228 --> 36:02.746
I can put in a good word.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.092
Thank you.

36:07.717 --> 36:09.339
Okay, people,
this is my treat.

36:09.339 --> 36:10.513
Thank God.

36:10.513 --> 36:11.755
- Yay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.654
Thank you.

36:13.654 --> 36:14.931
Thanks, Dr. Schmidt.

36:14.931 --> 36:16.070
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

36:16.070 --> 36:17.382
Welcome.

36:17.382 --> 36:18.383
Thank you.

36:18.383 --> 36:20.074
Mm-hmm.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.697
- Mm.
- Oh.

36:22.697 --> 36:24.216
Oh.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.528
- Chaser?
- Mm-hmm.

36:25.528 --> 36:26.667
What are you,
her babysitter?

36:26.667 --> 36:27.944
Man of honor, actually.

36:27.944 --> 36:29.532
Oh, thank God.

36:29.532 --> 36:31.119
I didn't wanna have to carry
around those blood vials.

36:33.294 --> 36:34.675
You mix them together,

36:34.675 --> 36:36.194
and you pour them out
at the altar.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.919
Why do you think
a maid of honor does that?

36:37.919 --> 36:39.680
My mom did it
at my uncle's wedding.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.440
I cannot overstate
how not normal that is.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.339
Whatever.
I'm going to order food.

36:43.339 --> 36:45.341
Anyone else?

36:45.341 --> 36:48.240
Can you get me some fries?

36:48.240 --> 36:49.241
I'm starving.

36:51.381 --> 36:53.349
- So when's the wedding?
- Next month.

36:53.349 --> 36:55.523
But it's in town
so no one has to travel.

36:55.523 --> 36:57.076
And I don't need
any extra time off.

36:57.076 --> 36:58.354
Trey is gonna take care
of most of the logistics,

36:58.354 --> 36:59.803
so you won't--
- Griffin, I--

36:59.803 --> 37:02.220
I was just asking.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.807
- Sorry, yeah.
- That's okay.

37:03.807 --> 37:05.878
- Next month.
- Okay.

37:05.878 --> 37:07.984
Wanna get out of here?

37:07.984 --> 37:10.918
I can't.

37:10.918 --> 37:13.472
We said no feelings,
and unfortunately,

37:13.472 --> 37:16.268
I find your staunch support
of animal rights...

37:16.268 --> 37:17.959
hot.

37:17.959 --> 37:20.065
Okay.

37:20.065 --> 37:21.963
What if I have no feelings?

37:25.829 --> 37:26.934
That works.

37:35.183 --> 37:36.737
You wanna pick up takeout?

37:36.737 --> 37:38.911
I kind of feel like Italian.

37:38.911 --> 37:41.845
I already ordered,
Chang's Garden.

37:41.845 --> 37:44.469
Right, of course you decided.

37:53.167 --> 37:56.791
Stop.
I need to look at you

37:56.791 --> 37:57.723
when I say this.

37:59.863 --> 38:01.796
Okay.

38:01.796 --> 38:03.695
You invited me to dinner
with your family,

38:03.695 --> 38:05.938
and then you abandoned me
when things got tough.

38:05.938 --> 38:07.285
What?
When?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.494
The first time
that I met your family,

38:09.494 --> 38:11.530
your father showed up,
and you became unhappy,

38:11.530 --> 38:16.880
and then you logged off,
and you left me there.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.675
My mother always used
to quote Maya Angelou.

38:18.675 --> 38:22.023
She used to say, "When someone
shows you who they are,

38:22.023 --> 38:24.302
believe them the first time."

38:24.302 --> 38:25.958
Why didn't I believe you
the first time?

38:25.958 --> 38:27.512
You showed me who you were,

38:27.512 --> 38:29.341
and I just didn't wanna see it.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.343
- And who am I?
- You're a person who retreats.

38:31.343 --> 38:33.311
When the going gets
tough, you retreat.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.072
You quit.
You disappear.

38:36.072 --> 38:40.179
You protect yourself, no matter
what it costs anybody else.

38:40.179 --> 38:43.182
You're the one thinking
of taking a job in Chicago.

38:43.182 --> 38:45.668
A job in Chicago
is nothing, Winston.

38:45.668 --> 38:48.360
Marriages can easily survive
a job in Chicago.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.329
But you don't seem
to want us to survive.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.848
You just seem to want to punish
me with your absence.

38:53.848 --> 38:56.092
- I'm right here!
- But you're not.

38:56.092 --> 38:57.714
You're not.

38:57.714 --> 39:00.993
You took your love,
and you retreated.

39:00.993 --> 39:05.032
You disappeared
inside yourself.

39:05.032 --> 39:07.241
When the going got tough,
you protected yourself,

39:07.241 --> 39:09.761
no matter what it cost
anybody else.

39:09.761 --> 39:11.728
I am right here.

39:11.728 --> 39:14.248
You are gone.

39:14.248 --> 39:16.215
You couldn't even think
of something nice to say

39:16.215 --> 39:18.356
about me this morning.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.219
Even when you wanted
to quit cardio,

39:20.219 --> 39:22.187
supposedly
to save our marriage,

39:22.187 --> 39:23.533
that was you quitting.

39:23.533 --> 39:25.052
That was you retreating.

39:25.052 --> 39:28.193
That was you giving up
your gift

39:28.193 --> 39:29.884
so that you could avoid
direct conflict,

39:29.884 --> 39:32.956
and that is what
I don't respect.

39:32.956 --> 39:36.857
It isn't your heart, Winston,
it's your cowardice.

39:36.857 --> 39:39.411
Oh, wow, really, Maggie?

39:39.411 --> 39:42.794
And the pizza in Chicago
is the best in the world.

39:42.794 --> 39:44.865
So I'm gonna go there.

39:44.865 --> 39:47.557
And I'm gonna take
my extraordinary passion,

39:47.557 --> 39:49.628

to build hearts

39:49.628 --> 39:51.458
that will save thousands
of lives.

39:51.458 --> 39:53.736
And you can stay here,
and you can pretend

39:53.736 --> 39:55.393
like it was you
who was abandoned,

39:55.393 --> 39:57.291
but we both know the truth.

40:14.101 --> 40:15.930
He was down.

40:15.930 --> 40:17.449
How are you feeling?

40:20.452 --> 40:23.110
I...

40:23.110 --> 40:26.734

40:29.323 --> 40:30.462

Hear that, Scout?

40:33.258 --> 40:36.157
She feels better.
Whoo-hoo!

40:36.157 --> 40:37.607
<i>So maybe you are
who you are.</i>

40:37.607 --> 40:40.507
All right,

Rough day?

40:53.105 --> 40:55.314
Oh, thank you.

40:55.314 --> 40:58.801
Oh, it was humbling.

40:58.801 --> 41:02.460
I missed a diagnosis
and almost lost a patient.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.600
But?

41:04.600 --> 41:07.844
I was bailed out
by a Shepherd.

41:07.844 --> 41:10.398
- Hmm.
- You?

41:12.677 --> 41:15.473
I'm afraid I might be losing
another sister.
