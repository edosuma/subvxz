00:26.276 --> 00:29.446
I guarantee you'll like her references,
Mr. Caribe.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.655
Listen.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.618
What was the take in the Houston bank?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.912
$1,200,000.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.206
Nice figure.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.626
We won't tell him I like yours better.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.088
Her name's Lil Thaxton.
Just what we need.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.967
Don't confuse your needs
with those of the organization.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.553
A pretty face can cause ugly problems.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.805
At least you can meet her.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.807
You've left me no choice.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.518
You've involved her too much already.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.813
It's either meet with her or kill her.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.191
When do we see you?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.276
I'll let you know.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.656
Honey, will you stop worrying? You're in.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.994
On a job that's gonna make Houston
look like a trip to the candy store.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.496
We'll see.

01:20.788 --> 01:21.915
Yeah, we'll see.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.005
Yes, sir?

01:29.339 --> 01:32.258
Leech, a full report, before tonight.

01:32.508 --> 01:33.885
You'll have it.

01:34.343 --> 01:36.220
The last thing we need is a ringer.

01:36.304 --> 01:39.599
No sweat. If she's a phony,
I know just what to do.

03:15.777 --> 03:18.864
Tony, I really should be
going back to my hotel.

03:19.573 --> 03:23.410
And miss the phone call
from your new employer? Come on, Lil.

03:26.038 --> 03:28.665
Then, as long as I'm going to meet
your Mr. Caribe...

03:28.749 --> 03:31.168
I should change
into something a little more...

03:31.710 --> 03:32.836
Appropriate.

03:32.919 --> 03:36.089
- Impressive, anyway.
- That sounds fascinating.

03:36.173 --> 03:38.717
- Back in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

04:46.617 --> 04:47.827
Steve.

04:49.328 --> 04:53.916
Diana, you had me worried. I was afraid
Ryan had found out who you really were.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.252
- I was afraid I'd never see you again.
- No way.

04:56.335 --> 04:58.880
Tony's so impressed with my cover story...

04:58.963 --> 05:02.091
that he's taking me to meet
the elusive Anton Caribe in person.

05:02.258 --> 05:05.803
That's great! Ryan's playing
right into our hands. When's the meeting?

05:05.886 --> 05:07.763
I don't know. We're waiting to hear.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.599
- What?
- That means Caribe's checking you out.

05:10.808 --> 05:13.144
- Any idea where he's hiding?
- No.

05:14.478 --> 05:18.733
All Tony will tell me is that he's
recruiting for a heist that's really big.

05:18.816 --> 05:21.569
- Bigger than his last three?
- Put together.

05:21.652 --> 05:25.448
If he's not arrested soon, he'll be
solely responsible for the national debt.

05:25.531 --> 05:27.950
He'll be arrested this time.
With enough evidence...

05:28.033 --> 05:30.244
to put him away for life
and throw away the key.

05:30.327 --> 05:32.079
The way things are going, I believe it.

05:32.163 --> 05:35.416
If he's checking you out,
I'll have to take care of a few details.

05:35.499 --> 05:37.960
I better get back to my friend
before he misses me.

05:38.294 --> 05:41.297
Listen, take some advice
from this old friend.

05:41.380 --> 05:42.798
You watch yourself. Be careful.

05:43.132 --> 05:45.509
Thanks, Steve, I will.

05:49.471 --> 05:50.806
Go!

06:19.835 --> 06:22.504
Dishonesty is no way
to start a relationship.

06:22.587 --> 06:24.214
What do you mean?

06:24.298 --> 06:26.091
You said 10 minutes.

06:27.634 --> 06:29.970
You've been gone 11 and a half.

06:31.263 --> 06:33.640
I had no idea you'd be counting.

06:39.771 --> 06:43.066
How are you doing there, Herb?
What news from the old neighborhood?

06:43.150 --> 06:45.694
I heard it's improved
since we got rid of you.

06:45.777 --> 06:47.821
- How have you been?
- Prosperous.

06:47.904 --> 06:50.240
- Is that right?
- Very prosperous.

06:50.323 --> 06:52.325
I'd like to check your mug files.

06:52.659 --> 06:55.745
- Anyone's in particular?
- Yes. Robbers. Female.

06:56.413 --> 06:57.789
Follow me.

07:02.294 --> 07:07.048
- Is there anyone in particular?
- Her name's Lil Thaxton, or so she says.

07:07.173 --> 07:10.009
The "T's" are over there.
Hey, buddy, you about done there?

07:10.093 --> 07:11.886
Yeah, just a second.

07:13.847 --> 07:15.849
- All yours, pal.
- Thank you.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.780
- Some record.
- I'll say.

07:31.114 --> 07:33.741
Huntsville. Alderson. Terminal Island.

07:33.992 --> 07:35.702
You planning on marrying her?

07:35.785 --> 07:38.871
A friend wants to invite her
to a grand opening.

07:39.622 --> 07:41.332
Thank you, Herbert.

07:41.416 --> 07:43.543
Any time, Prosperous.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.632
My thanks, too, Sergeant.

07:49.882 --> 07:52.760
You're welcome,
but what do I do with this?

07:58.891 --> 08:03.145
Let's just call it an IADC contribution
to the Police Memorial Fund.

08:03.229 --> 08:04.647
Okay, Steve.

08:11.988 --> 08:13.990
I'm really sorry about this, honey...

08:14.615 --> 08:17.576
but Mr. Caribe is very strict
about his privacy.

08:17.660 --> 08:21.997
I guess I'd do the same thing
if I were in his place. Wherever that is.

08:22.665 --> 08:24.834
You don't wanna know where that is.

08:24.917 --> 08:29.296
If you ever find out, you'll be able
to count your days on one hand.

08:31.132 --> 08:33.342
Just take it easy. I got you.

09:27.604 --> 09:31.233
Mr. Caribe, I'd like you
to meet Lil Thaxton.

09:31.984 --> 09:33.902
I hear you are very good at bank robbery.

09:35.237 --> 09:38.573
Good enough to feel ready
for bigger and better things, Mr. Caribe.

09:43.870 --> 09:44.955
You're very beautiful.

09:46.123 --> 09:47.207
Thank you.

09:47.290 --> 09:51.670
Unlike Mr. Ryan, however, I don't permit
beauty to color my good judgment.

09:52.963 --> 09:55.048
I've done my homework. We can trust her.

09:55.131 --> 09:58.718
When have I heard that before?
Last year, wasn't it?

09:59.469 --> 10:02.180
Only the name wasn't Lil, it was Karen.

10:02.305 --> 10:03.723
Who is now serving five years.

10:03.890 --> 10:04.975
It's seven.

10:05.308 --> 10:10.021
Which you could very easily be doing
right alongside her. Correct, Mr. Ryan?

10:13.316 --> 10:16.528
We have no personal knowledge
of this person's capabilities.

10:16.611 --> 10:18.696
Just hearsay and police reports.

10:18.822 --> 10:21.491
Try me. I can handle anything.

10:23.034 --> 10:25.495
A very revealing choice of words.

10:26.037 --> 10:29.582
I'm afraid "try" is unacceptable
in my vocabulary.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.711
Are you saying she's not in on the job?

10:33.795 --> 10:35.630
I'm saying she's not.

10:36.881 --> 10:38.258
Nobody is.

10:38.841 --> 10:43.012
I just heard. The whole security system's
been changed on the vault.

10:43.096 --> 10:47.975
Techtron alarm engineers were
there all week installing a new setup.

10:48.059 --> 10:49.977
All our plans are no good.

10:50.061 --> 10:52.438
The Techtron plan's a piece of cake.

10:52.605 --> 10:55.024
I can get you the plans
for the new alarm system.

10:55.441 --> 10:57.777
- Get her out of here, Ryan.
- No!

10:58.820 --> 11:01.697
You want proof I know my business.
You'll get it.

11:01.781 --> 11:05.368
- Lil, the place is like a fortress.
- All the better.

11:07.078 --> 11:08.996
I get you the plans...

11:09.664 --> 11:12.625
and you let me in
on whatever it is you want them for.

11:12.708 --> 11:14.210
Is it a deal?

11:15.086 --> 11:18.381
Obviously. It's the only kind I insist upon.

11:19.340 --> 11:22.593
- I can't lose.
- Good. I'll get them tonight.

11:25.596 --> 11:29.016
The plans are in file number 10355
at Techtron.

11:29.308 --> 11:30.684
What are they for?

11:30.768 --> 11:34.063
That, Miss Thaxton,
is none of your business.

11:34.647 --> 11:35.731
Yet.

11:37.608 --> 11:39.610
Take me to my car, Tony.

11:40.361 --> 11:41.487
Get her on her way.

11:41.987 --> 11:43.072
Excuse me.

11:43.489 --> 11:46.200
Just as soon as she's been blindfolded.

11:47.368 --> 11:51.622
I'm beginning to understand
why you've never been caught, Mr. Caribe.

11:52.122 --> 11:53.916
And I never will be.

11:54.541 --> 11:57.378
The next job is gonna be my grand finale.

11:57.878 --> 12:00.172
I intend to retire with so much wealth...

12:00.255 --> 12:03.175
not a police force in the world
can touch me.

12:03.884 --> 12:05.135
Got it.

12:15.854 --> 12:17.022
Stay on her, Leech.

12:17.856 --> 12:20.984
Anything suspicious,
don't bother to report back.

12:22.903 --> 12:24.571
Just execute her.

14:12.512 --> 14:15.431
Okay, lady. Where'd you
cut your way through this thing?

14:58.015 --> 15:00.935
I don't know where you went in,
but this is where I go in.

16:14.925 --> 16:16.009
What the...

16:16.092 --> 16:17.218
Wonder Woman.

16:17.302 --> 16:19.888
I want you to forget
that you've seen me here tonight.

16:19.971 --> 16:21.222
I will forget.

16:21.306 --> 16:24.559
- Now lead me to the file room.
- Certainly. This way.

16:54.672 --> 16:58.384
I need the files, plans 10355.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.938
- Here they are.
- Thank you.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.499
One for Anton Caribe...

17:34.378 --> 17:36.756
and one for Steve Trevor.

17:42.219 --> 17:44.263
Put back the file.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.809
Is there anything else?

17:48.893 --> 17:53.481
Just remember, there was no break-in,
and Wonder Woman was never here.

18:02.615 --> 18:07.161
I want you to stay here for five minutes,
and then resume your rounds. Thank you.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.626
Wonder Woman.

18:15.002 --> 18:18.464
Just tell me where Lil Thaxton went
and I promise you I won't hurt you.

18:18.547 --> 18:19.673
Lil Thaxton?

18:19.757 --> 18:23.010
I know you're her accomplice.
I saw her come this way.

18:23.177 --> 18:25.429
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:25.512 --> 18:27.806
I'm sure you don't. Okay.

18:27.973 --> 18:31.477
I've been after Lil Thaxton ever since
she pulled that Houston robbery.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.646
And I haven't got time for games.

18:48.368 --> 18:49.619
You!

18:49.745 --> 18:53.331
Would you please be quiet.
Wonder Woman has ears like radar.

18:53.707 --> 18:56.877
When the heat's after you,
it's after you in a big way.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.630
Well I can handle it, Leech.
I don't get locked in closets.

19:01.173 --> 19:03.925
And I get what I come for.

19:04.843 --> 19:08.680
You photographed those plans?
With Wonder Woman on your tail?

19:09.389 --> 19:12.684
- How?
- You figure it out. You're the expert.

19:13.226 --> 19:15.979
In the meantime, get me back to Caribe.

19:16.730 --> 19:20.525
It's time to deal myself in
on the grand finale.

19:51.264 --> 19:52.390
Good morning, Ira.

19:52.473 --> 19:56.769
"Good"is a subject assessment
not substantiated by scientific evidence.

19:56.853 --> 19:58.563
Please be specific.

19:58.646 --> 20:01.691
He must've gotten up
on the wrong side of his battery charger.

20:01.774 --> 20:04.610
All right, Ira. It's 7:30 a. m. 68 degrees.

20:04.694 --> 20:07.155
I need these photographs analyzed.

20:16.789 --> 20:17.915
Blueprints submitted...

20:17.999 --> 20:22.295
are ultimate state-of-the-art alarm system,
self-powered and foolproof.

20:23.129 --> 20:26.090
- And used in what bank?
- Used in no bank.

20:27.133 --> 20:28.676
You want to check that again, Ira.

20:28.759 --> 20:31.345
We've got to know
what bank Caribe's planning to hit...

20:31.429 --> 20:33.681
so we can call off their guards
and protect Diana.

20:33.764 --> 20:37.935
I repeat. Alarm system submitted
is not for any bank in any country.

20:38.769 --> 20:40.104
Then what is it used for?

20:40.187 --> 20:42.940
Insufficient data precludes any answer.

21:00.332 --> 21:02.960
I'm impressed by your professionalism.

21:04.587 --> 21:07.298
- Welcome to my organization.
- Thank you.

21:07.715 --> 21:09.800
Shall we talk percentages?

21:09.925 --> 21:14.388
Upon perfect execution of your duties,
your share will be $3 million.

21:15.514 --> 21:17.391
Three million dollars?

21:18.058 --> 21:20.269
What are we robbing? The IRS?

21:23.355 --> 21:27.109
Do you recall the Beirut bank robbery
in January, 1976?

21:27.526 --> 21:31.613
Of course. That was the biggest job
in history. $50 million.

21:32.656 --> 21:35.367
You also recall it was never recovered.

21:35.826 --> 21:38.954
That's right. They never could
pin that job on anyone.

21:39.037 --> 21:40.414
Was it you?

21:41.415 --> 21:43.375
No. A competitor.

21:44.835 --> 21:46.420
Michael Sutton.

21:49.298 --> 21:54.094
I've now decided he should be relieved
of that great financial responsibility.

21:54.177 --> 21:55.304
I see.

21:56.304 --> 21:58.890
We're going
to steal the Beirut money from him.

21:58.974 --> 22:01.017
The Beirut money and more.

22:01.601 --> 22:05.230
And that will make mine
the biggest job in history.

22:05.647 --> 22:07.816
He makes it sound so simple.

22:08.483 --> 22:11.194
Breaking into Fort Knox might be easier.

22:11.987 --> 22:14.114
You see, that is why it is so important...

22:14.197 --> 22:18.076
to find and use the best talent.

22:19.703 --> 22:22.789
I think it's time
you met your colleagues. Tony?

22:25.750 --> 22:27.711
Lil, this is Paul Rojak.

22:27.919 --> 22:30.755
- The football player?
- No. The ex-football player.

22:30.839 --> 22:34.217
Weren't you up for manslaughter
for what you did to that quarterback?

22:34.300 --> 22:35.719
No. He lived.

22:37.262 --> 22:39.347
And watch out for this one.

22:39.431 --> 22:42.684
His name is Grease,
our mechanic and general handyman.

22:43.351 --> 22:46.354
You're better looking
than a set of whitewalls on a '54 sedan.

22:46.438 --> 22:47.605
Thanks.

22:48.356 --> 22:51.151
- Is this everyone?
- With the exception of Leech...

22:51.234 --> 22:53.695
whom you've already had
the displeasure of meeting.

22:53.778 --> 22:55.446
Yes, I certainly did.

22:55.530 --> 22:57.490
- Where is he, anyway?
- He'll be back.

22:57.615 --> 23:00.910
Said he had some personal business
to take cafe of.

23:01.077 --> 23:02.328
Personal.

23:21.389 --> 23:22.932
Marge Douglass?

23:25.518 --> 23:26.727
Maybe.

23:28.396 --> 23:30.565
Just like I promised you over the phone.

23:38.239 --> 23:39.365
Now what?

23:39.448 --> 23:43.828
I'll take you for a ride, I'll blindfold
you, and then we'll ride some more.

23:43.911 --> 23:44.996
Blindfold?

23:45.079 --> 23:48.082
Just until I get you into a room
with Lil Thaxton.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.418
Old Larcenous Lil.

23:51.001 --> 23:53.504
Are you sure you can recognize her?

23:53.587 --> 23:56.841
After six months in the same cellblock,
how could I help it?

23:57.550 --> 24:00.136
Of course. How could you help it?

24:15.693 --> 24:16.860
An abandoned bank?

24:17.403 --> 24:20.531
Actually, it's
a very well disguised fortress.

24:20.823 --> 24:23.492
It'd have to be, to keep $50 million there.

24:23.575 --> 24:27.579
It's complete with bedrooms, a kitchen,
sentry dogs, armed guards...

24:27.830 --> 24:30.040
and one of the finest vaults
ever constructed.

24:30.874 --> 24:33.085
To say nothing of the new alarm system.

24:33.168 --> 24:36.046
Which is powered
by a selfcontained energy source...

24:36.130 --> 24:38.757
inside my old friend's enclave.

24:38.841 --> 24:42.803
That's great! We can't destroy the alarm
without setting it off.

24:43.929 --> 24:46.598
Fortunately, Mr. Sutton's brain
functions on a level...

24:46.682 --> 24:49.142
not much higher than yours, Mr. Rojak.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.687
He also believes the system is foolproof.

24:51.770 --> 24:54.398
You've figured out a way to get to it.

24:55.190 --> 24:56.358
Of course.

24:59.152 --> 25:02.406
I want you to memorize
the layout of the inside of the bank areas.

25:03.115 --> 25:06.493
The lighting won't be nearly as adequate
the next time you see them.

25:07.703 --> 25:09.830
Miss Thaxton, I want you...

25:11.164 --> 25:13.792
to pay particular attention to the study.

25:13.875 --> 25:17.212
Somewhere on this wall, I imagine
between the "O" and "P" volumes...

25:17.295 --> 25:19.756
of the encyclopedia, is the alarm control.

25:20.882 --> 25:23.468
Your responsibility
will be to deactivate it.

25:24.719 --> 25:26.137
You got it.

25:26.513 --> 25:27.847
What? Her?

25:30.684 --> 25:33.979
That's a pretty heavy assignment.
Why don't I take the alarm?

25:34.062 --> 25:36.856
Don't you trust your little protégé, Tony?

25:38.441 --> 25:39.651
I'd trust her with my life.

25:39.734 --> 25:43.613
Repeat that, Ryan.
Loud and clear. For the record.

25:44.114 --> 25:45.490
What is this, Leech?

25:45.573 --> 25:48.243
Just doing
what you taught me, Mr. Caribe.

25:48.326 --> 25:50.495
Double-checking on the double-checking.

25:50.829 --> 25:55.708
I found a friend of a friend who spent
six months at Huntsville with Lil Thaxton.

25:58.711 --> 25:59.754
So what?

25:59.838 --> 26:04.384
So, I thought it might be very educational
if I arranged a little reunion.

26:31.786 --> 26:35.623
Lil, honey, you sure don't show the years.

26:36.541 --> 26:38.042
Hey, how are you?

26:38.125 --> 26:40.878
I swear, you give old Marge
a fit of nostalgia.

26:40.962 --> 26:43.547
Marge, you look great. You got parole?

26:43.631 --> 26:47.343
Leech! Get that woman out of here.
You're the one threatening our security.

26:47.426 --> 26:49.053
Sorry, Mr. Caribe.

26:49.136 --> 26:51.847
How about let's get together
for a drink sometime, hon?

26:51.931 --> 26:56.519
I'd love it. I'm just a little worried about
the company you've been keeping lately.

26:57.770 --> 27:00.314
You watch out for her. She's my friend.

27:00.731 --> 27:01.941
Come on.

27:05.444 --> 27:09.114
Being overzealous is going to be
the death of him someday.

27:38.936 --> 27:41.313
- How'd it go?
- No problem.

27:47.152 --> 27:50.197
Good! The real Marge Douglass
will be glad to hear that, too.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.908
Yeah. Means she just completed parole.

28:06.672 --> 28:10.550
A member of one of Caribe's little gang
wishes to make a deal with us?

28:10.634 --> 28:13.220
Talked to the guy myself, Mr. Sutton.

28:13.595 --> 28:16.390
- When is the lady to be shipped?
- Tonight.

28:17.599 --> 28:21.561
Well, by all means,
pay him what he wants.

28:22.687 --> 28:25.273
It's not every day
someone has enough intelligence...

28:25.357 --> 28:27.984
to double-cross my unworthy adversary.

28:34.407 --> 28:37.994
I only wish I could be there
to see the look on his face.

28:40.038 --> 28:43.041
I'm really sorry, honey.
I wish there were another way.

28:43.124 --> 28:44.334
So do I.

28:44.959 --> 28:47.212
Stop wasting time and get in.

28:48.171 --> 28:50.507
If this chamber was
a good enough resting place...

28:50.590 --> 28:54.010
for the great Egyptian Queen Nefertiti
for thousands of years...

28:54.344 --> 28:56.638
you can endure the discomfort
for an hour or two.

28:56.721 --> 28:59.641
Queen Nefertiti
was hardly in a position to refuse.

28:59.724 --> 29:01.935
- I said, get in.
- Yes, sir.

29:05.897 --> 29:07.690
Are you comfortable?

29:08.107 --> 29:09.776
Not in the least.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.154
Then I suggest
that you ponder the $3 million...

29:13.238 --> 29:16.366
that your discomfort
is about to obtain for you.

29:22.497 --> 29:24.791
Hey, fellows, will you take it easy?

30:04.372 --> 30:06.957
Ross, put the gun away.
We all know why we're here.

30:07.041 --> 30:10.461
Relax. We gotta make it look good,
don't we? Just relax.

30:10.544 --> 30:12.546
When am I getting paid for tipping you off?

30:12.630 --> 30:16.217
Tomorrow. As soon as Sutton
checks out the lady back here. Relax.

30:16.967 --> 30:18.135
- Got it?
- Okay.

30:22.264 --> 30:24.266
You want me
to put that gun away for you?

30:24.350 --> 30:26.518
Okay, you got it. Just relax.

30:57.508 --> 31:00.469
Next time you wanna double-cross Caribe,
let us know.

31:00.552 --> 31:04.097
- Just come through with the bread.
- See you later, Tony.

31:19.863 --> 31:21.990
I want to report a robbery.

31:22.616 --> 31:26.536
Good for you. Now you know
what it feels like to be the victim.

31:27.037 --> 31:30.499
The lady should be able
to deactivate the alarm right on schedule.

31:30.582 --> 31:31.750
Right.

31:46.139 --> 31:48.141
Here she is, Mr. Sutton.

31:54.689 --> 31:57.317
How much did we agree to pay Mr. Ryan?

31:57.817 --> 31:59.110
$15,000.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.488
Is she the real thing?

32:05.950 --> 32:07.494
Very much so.

32:08.786 --> 32:12.081
At this moment more precious
than anything on earth.

32:13.041 --> 32:16.669
For Anton Caribe stole her
from the British Museum.

32:17.837 --> 32:20.715
And now I have stolen her
from Anton Caribe.

32:24.302 --> 32:26.012
I'd say another 20 minutes.

32:26.095 --> 32:29.766
Our friend Sutton will get tired
of patting himself on the back...

32:29.891 --> 32:32.060
and go to bed at his usual time.

32:32.143 --> 32:34.562
Then how long do we have to wait?

32:34.854 --> 32:38.733
No more than 10 minutes.
Sutton's bedroom is on another floor.

32:39.817 --> 32:42.820
That will leave Lil all alone in his office.

32:42.904 --> 32:46.699
She'll be able to turn off the alarm
right on schedule.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.205
What should we do with her, Mr. Sutton?

32:53.289 --> 32:56.334
Provide her the security
she so well deserves.

32:56.417 --> 32:58.961
What? You want to post a guard here?

32:59.837 --> 33:02.965
She's far too precious
to entrust to human care.

33:04.175 --> 33:06.594
Lock her up inside the main vault.

33:41.879 --> 33:44.340
She should be shutting off the alarm
any minute now.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.801
I'm not setting one foot in there
until she gives us the signal.

33:49.887 --> 33:51.555
Now get the dogs.

34:35.849 --> 34:37.976
There you are, Your Majesty.

34:38.101 --> 34:41.188
You're as safe
as if you were back in your tomb.

35:12.135 --> 35:13.344
Great.

36:09.066 --> 36:11.777
It's all right, boys. It's okay.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.114
We're friends.

36:23.873 --> 36:25.207
Good boys.

36:27.751 --> 36:31.046
Now, listen to me.
I respect your sense of duty very much.

36:31.130 --> 36:32.882
But I need your help.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.718
In a little while, four men...

36:36.302 --> 36:39.888
will return with me and they're gonna
try to steal from your territory.

36:39.972 --> 36:41.599
Listening?

36:41.682 --> 36:44.560
I know you'll want to hurt them
as you have been trained.

36:44.643 --> 36:46.395
But for my sake, please don't.

36:50.816 --> 36:52.568
You're such good dogs.

36:52.651 --> 36:55.779
Okay. I want you to listen to me.

36:58.991 --> 37:02.453
You must not move until I return.

37:03.245 --> 37:04.496
Please.

37:18.427 --> 37:21.596
I think you'd better stay out here,
Your Highness.

37:21.847 --> 37:26.101
If they see you in the vault,
they'd wonder how Lil could've escaped.

38:19.487 --> 38:20.822
Thank you.

38:34.210 --> 38:35.962
Your friend is late, Ryan.

38:36.045 --> 38:39.966
I guess Little Miss Huntsville
can't cut the mustard after all.

40:15.310 --> 40:18.522
There's the signal. She's fixed the alarm.

40:19.147 --> 40:21.942
Don't forget the laser gun.
Mr. Caribe, we're going in.

40:22.317 --> 40:23.402
Good.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.409
What took you so long? We were worried.

40:30.492 --> 40:33.412
The dogs were even more nervous.
I had to take care of them.

40:33.495 --> 40:35.205
Now get us inside the vault.

40:58.937 --> 41:00.438
Guard patrol.

41:13.118 --> 41:14.452
Let's go.

41:42.814 --> 41:45.400
Hold it. You sure that thing is out?

41:54.242 --> 41:56.619
These dogs are really out.
What did you give them?

41:56.702 --> 42:00.081
Something that was developed
a few years ago in the Caribbean.

42:07.713 --> 42:09.799
I knew you'd come through for us, honey.

43:09.274 --> 43:10.651
What about Miss Egypt out there?

43:10.734 --> 43:12.903
Caribe wants her back.
Put all the money in it.

43:12.986 --> 43:15.280
Then why didn't he carry
the stupid thing himself?

43:15.364 --> 43:18.325
- Get out of here. Let's go. Move it.
- Come on!

43:19.952 --> 43:21.161
Got it?

43:21.245 --> 43:23.121
How much is here you think?

43:23.205 --> 43:27.084
Every cent from the Beirut job,
and a couple million from some milk runs.

43:27.167 --> 43:30.754
- Maybe we'll get a bonus.
- You got a good sense of humor, lady.

43:39.596 --> 43:41.556
Come on, let's move it.

43:44.601 --> 43:45.727
What time is it?

43:45.811 --> 43:47.687
Another 10 minutes before we're relieved.

43:47.771 --> 43:50.774
- Better check the alarm.
- I watched him turn it on myself.

43:50.899 --> 43:52.442
That's not the point.

43:52.526 --> 43:55.445
The thing is brand new.
We're supposed to keep an eye on it.

43:59.783 --> 44:01.117
That's it. Go.

44:02.410 --> 44:05.080
I've been waiting for you all my life.

44:16.341 --> 44:17.634
I'll finish it. Go.

44:25.642 --> 44:27.018
The laser.

44:28.102 --> 44:30.772
- This thing is off.
- Try turning it on.

44:33.608 --> 44:34.734
Bad circuit breaker.

44:38.780 --> 44:39.864
No!

44:45.703 --> 44:47.580
Tony!

44:52.627 --> 44:55.713
- What's happening?
- Someone's in the vault room!

45:26.452 --> 45:28.412
You gave her
her death sentence back there!

45:28.496 --> 45:31.248
I didn't see you
volunteering to commute it!

45:49.266 --> 45:51.393
That should pass inspection.

45:52.686 --> 45:55.773
Now, dear friends, listen. I need your help.

45:57.191 --> 45:58.275
Good boy.

46:05.532 --> 46:08.202
Mr. Sutton, come out.
You won't believe this.

46:11.955 --> 46:14.875
Get their trainer in here
first thing tomorrow.

46:14.958 --> 46:17.211
He charged $10,000 apiece
for those mutts.

46:17.294 --> 46:19.046
And that's robbery.

46:31.558 --> 46:33.727
Well, gentlemen, I think the final count...

46:33.810 --> 46:37.230
should be $53,280,000.

46:37.731 --> 46:40.567
Acapulco here I come.

46:40.651 --> 46:45.072
Everything is here but your lady, Mr. Ryan.
What happened?

46:45.822 --> 46:47.741
This little creep left her for Sutton.

46:47.824 --> 46:49.659
The dumb broad tripped the alarm.

46:49.743 --> 46:53.371
- That's no reason to leave her there.
- She got what she deserved.

46:53.455 --> 46:57.459
Now, boys.
You're not fighting over me, are you?

46:58.460 --> 47:01.004
- Lil.
- The name's not Lil.

47:02.255 --> 47:03.757
Diana Prince.

47:06.384 --> 47:08.637
Officers? Don't do it!

47:09.846 --> 47:11.890
Diana Prince.
Intra Agency Defense Command.

47:11.973 --> 47:15.935
Assignment: To capture
master thief Anton Caribe with the goods.

47:16.186 --> 47:18.271
You haven't caught him yet, Miss Prince.

47:18.355 --> 47:21.524
Yes, she has, Caribe. Put it down!

47:26.237 --> 47:27.906
See what you get.

47:29.616 --> 47:32.160
See what you get
when you trust a woman?

47:32.243 --> 47:34.788
Yeah. You get the job done.

47:44.422 --> 47:46.174
Okay. Move them out.
