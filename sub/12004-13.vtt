00:00.143 --> 00:01.812
<i>Previously on "Switched at birth"...</i>

00:02.267 --> 00:03.797
I'm coach Medlock. Do you have a second?

00:03.937 --> 00:04.438
Yeah.

00:04.795 --> 00:06.655
I decided to take coach Medlock's offer.

00:06.739 --> 00:08.222
I'm going to join the Buckner team.

00:08.285 --> 00:09.779
I know you're mad, but I'm doing it.

00:09.837 --> 00:11.962
Dale, I know you're a member
of the hospital board.

00:11.962 --> 00:13.795
We probably shouldn't be
talking about this.

00:13.864 --> 00:15.761
But the hospital is part of this community.

00:15.829 --> 00:17.233
You really wanna be
the guy who puts it under

00:17.281 --> 00:19.253
because you feel you're
entitled to a huge payday?

00:19.318 --> 00:21.298
All of these people can write
books about their lives,

00:21.340 --> 00:22.259
why can't I?

00:23.163 --> 00:25.112
Oh, he... hello.

00:25.195 --> 00:27.390
She is not just your mom.

00:27.468 --> 00:29.641
She's my mom's best friend.

00:29.740 --> 00:31.569
I can't have her hate me.

00:31.673 --> 00:33.773
There are some people
that love you so much.

00:33.904 --> 00:34.907
And then there are others

00:34.907 --> 00:37.570
that even the tiniest reminder
brings you down?

00:37.795 --> 00:40.220
That's my dad. I hate
even thinking about him.

00:40.769 --> 00:42.503
You did that?

Are you Emmett Bledsoe?

00:58.566 --> 01:00.165
Are you Emmett Bledsoe, sir?

01:00.719 --> 01:02.485
We have a warrant for your arrest.

01:05.394 --> 01:06.753
Drop that weapon, sir.

01:06.842 --> 01:07.746
Drop the weapon, sir.

01:07.829 --> 01:09.303
I said drop it!

01:11.021 --> 01:13.660
** charges, huh?

01:13.891 --> 01:16.634
Do not resist, sir. Come on, let's go.

01:20.137 --> 01:21.699
What, you got something to say, kid?

01:24.652 --> 01:25.789
Huh?

01:26.521 --> 01:27.681
Get in there.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.383
Where is my son?

01:49.420 --> 01:51.530
Excuse me, are you
Emmett Bledsoe's mother?

01:51.531 --> 01:52.887
Where is my son?

01:53.865 --> 01:56.975
Hale. Your son is in the conference room.

01:58.075 --> 01:59.039
Does he have an interpreter?

01:59.040 --> 02:00.596
Did you cuff his hands in
the front instead of the back?

02:00.597 --> 02:03.140
Miss, miss, I was with him during booking.

02:04.317 --> 02:06.179
What the hell are you
charging him with anyway?

02:06.180 --> 02:08.764
First-degree trespassing and vandalism.

02:13.863 --> 02:15.328
She doesn't believe you.

02:17.706 --> 02:18.966
Follow me.

02:31.028 --> 02:33.265
What exactly did he vandalize?

02:33.574 --> 02:34.608
Why are you so sure he did it?

02:34.609 --> 02:36.926
He tagged the billboard on elm.

02:37.750 --> 02:41.113
It's amazing the details
these digital cameras can capture.

02:52.850 --> 02:54.702
Okay, you scared the hell out of him.

02:56.538 --> 02:57.841
He won't do it again.

03:01.399 --> 03:03.924
- Can we go home now?
- Yeah, you can go,

03:04.676 --> 03:07.084
but we take these crimes very seriously.

03:08.012 --> 03:09.925
And we are pressing charges.

03:21.590 --> 03:22.427
Hi.

03:22.428 --> 03:24.216
- Hey!
- That's... uh, okay.

03:24.217 --> 03:27.056
- Hey.
- Okay.

03:34.188 --> 03:36.854
Oh, that's right. I come sans Kennish.

03:37.148 --> 03:39.567
And they were okay with
you to see me alone?

03:39.956 --> 03:42.225
They finally realized you
weren't gonna kidnap me...

03:42.319 --> 03:43.942
- No.
- And neither of them could wrap

03:43.943 --> 03:46.573
their brain around a cuban-chinese place.

03:48.060 --> 03:48.917
- How was your day?
- So how was your d...

03:48.918 --> 03:52.074
- No, you. You first.
- You, me... Okay.

03:54.041 --> 03:58.285
So is it just me or
is this like really weird?

03:59.103 --> 04:02.363
It's like a cross between
an interview and a date.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.116
Yeah, I'm sure the most we see each other
the better it will be.

04:06.324 --> 04:08.213
Oh, the espresso here is incredible.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.890
I think they add a little gin in it,
you'll love it.

04:12.214 --> 04:13.465
Oh great.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.493
Oh, is that okay,
that I ordered this for you?

04:16.820 --> 04:17.653
Oh yeah, of course.

04:17.654 --> 04:19.685
I mean your parents...
they let you drink coffee, no?

04:20.017 --> 04:22.625
They're not the biggest
fans of me having caffeine.

04:22.626 --> 04:24.682
And they're right. Let me
order something else for you.

04:24.683 --> 04:26.310
Oh no no no. No.

04:26.837 --> 04:28.795
You gotta stick with your decisions,
be consistent.

04:28.796 --> 04:30.986
That's, like, parenting rule #1.

04:31.282 --> 04:32.938
I'm sorry. I'm not sure

04:32.939 --> 04:35.440
what the father
of a sexy new girl should be doing.

04:36.715 --> 04:38.752
Maybe if you'd been
around to raise Daphne,

04:38.753 --> 04:40.553
you'd probably have a lot more practice.

04:42.684 --> 04:43.715
You're right.

04:44.519 --> 04:45.361
For what it's worth,

04:45.362 --> 04:47.818
I've been trying to call her, texting.

04:48.379 --> 04:51.099
If you have any idea of what else I could do,
it would be great.

04:55.552 --> 04:58.712
Okay, what's the sign for pick and roll?

05:00.118 --> 05:01.115
Nice.

05:01.116 --> 05:04.409
And what does this mean?

05:06.043 --> 05:08.666
Jenna takes the ball out,
inbounds double-stack play.

05:09.762 --> 05:10.958
What, is that wrong?

05:11.367 --> 05:13.558
No, it's just, you know,

05:13.572 --> 05:15.058
Jenna, double-stacked.

05:16.165 --> 05:17.800
You're laughing 'cause she's stacked?

05:17.941 --> 05:21.506
- She's blessed.
- You need to stop hanging out with Wilke.

05:21.507 --> 05:23.415
I know, and start hanging out with Jenna.

05:23.618 --> 05:25.768
Come on! This is my
first game with Buckner.

05:25.769 --> 05:27.215
I really don't wanna mess it up.

05:28.074 --> 05:29.900
What's the sign for "Give and go" again?

05:31.136 --> 05:34.770
Oh, hey, how did your dinner go with...

05:35.461 --> 05:37.967
Angelo. You can say his name.

05:40.356 --> 05:44.212
You know, he really wants to see you

05:44.213 --> 05:47.534
and explain why he did what he did.

05:48.553 --> 05:50.882
Don't you two have anything
better to talk about?

05:51.735 --> 05:53.518
He feels really bad

05:53.519 --> 05:56.441
and you know, you might wanna

05:57.072 --> 05:58.685
hear what he has to say.

06:01.876 --> 06:05.120
Let's go over the zone
defense again, yeah?

06:34.097 --> 06:35.866
Hey, hon, can you give me a hand?

06:41.213 --> 06:43.346
So I was looking through an old album

06:43.347 --> 06:45.263
and there are a lot of photos missing.

06:45.264 --> 06:47.440
Yeah, they fall out sometimes.

06:47.952 --> 06:49.768
All the ones of Angelo?

06:52.297 --> 06:54.980
Um, yeah.

06:57.241 --> 06:58.518
Do you still have them?

06:59.628 --> 07:00.848
I do.

07:11.296 --> 07:12.711
Could I see them?

07:29.854 --> 07:30.862
What?

07:31.546 --> 07:34.234
I'm just admiring
my very own Willa Cather.

07:35.338 --> 07:37.534
Way to pull a name out of thin air.

07:37.535 --> 07:39.764
I pay attention at back-to-school nights.

07:40.742 --> 07:42.641
I just... I don't know where to begin...

07:44.010 --> 07:46.658
With us sitting in that lab office,

07:47.502 --> 07:49.386
when Bay took the blood test

07:50.397 --> 07:52.171
or when we first met Daphne.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.763
Why don't you write about all of
it and decide the order later?

07:57.429 --> 08:00.192
Huh. Well, that's not a bad idea.

08:00.482 --> 08:01.753
Anytime.

08:02.425 --> 08:05.899
Did you happen to tell our lawyer
that you're writing this book?

08:05.900 --> 08:09.178
No. Why, do you think I should?

08:09.513 --> 08:10.893
Well, it could impact the case.

08:10.894 --> 08:12.410
It might not be a bad idea.

08:15.372 --> 08:16.369
Is that your way of saying

08:16.370 --> 08:18.430
you want this whole book
thing to just go away?

08:18.431 --> 08:20.225
No, it is my way of saying

08:20.226 --> 08:22.094
I think this book is
gonna be a best-seller,

08:22.095 --> 08:25.423
but I don't want the hospital to
find a way to use it against us.

08:25.775 --> 08:26.979
That's all.

08:37.577 --> 08:39.224
Here are the ones I could find.

09:07.073 --> 09:09.276
- Emmett's been arrested.
- What?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.276
Did you know Emmett was arrested tonight?

09:12.674 --> 09:14.884
- Wait. What?
- Yeah, they arrested him

09:14.885 --> 09:16.799
for trespassing and vandalism.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.056
I don't understand. What was he doing?

09:19.194 --> 09:21.558
They have photos of him

09:21.559 --> 09:23.890
tagging pictures on
a billboard or something.

09:23.891 --> 09:25.936
- Oh no.
- What, did you know about it?

09:25.937 --> 09:26.795
Uh,

09:27.694 --> 09:28.479
I have to go.

09:53.815 --> 09:55.065
Hey.

09:57.244 --> 09:59.374
Not a good time, I know.

10:00.314 --> 10:01.587
That's why I'm here.

10:01.588 --> 10:04.372
I... I heard about Emmett getting...

10:05.227 --> 10:06.456
What is the sign?

10:09.291 --> 10:11.214
Is he okay? Can I see him?

10:13.140 --> 10:13.790
Grounded?

10:15.343 --> 10:17.216
No, wait. I...

10:17.217 --> 10:18.388
I'm sorry.

10:19.078 --> 10:20.379
This is my fault.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.689
I'm the one the police
should have arrested.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.584
Because it was my...

10:29.254 --> 10:30.803
piece. It was my...

10:43.907 --> 10:47.033
Okay, a little slower, please.

10:53.881 --> 10:56.719
Yes, help Emmett... yes I-I...
That is what I am saying

10:56.720 --> 11:00.115
I want to help h... I want to help him.

11:17.628 --> 11:19.097
Uh, what are you doing here?

11:19.307 --> 11:21.346
- I needed a trim.
- And?

11:21.347 --> 11:23.496
And I can't come to the house,

11:23.590 --> 11:25.273
and I really wanted to talk to you.

11:25.704 --> 11:27.199
If you wanna make plans with Bay,

11:27.200 --> 11:29.882
- you need to talk to the Kennishes.
- It's not about Bay.

11:30.166 --> 11:33.316
There's a space for rent around
the corner from my apartment.

11:33.317 --> 11:36.550
- You already have an apartment?
- I told you I was here to stay.

11:37.035 --> 11:38.194
I... I guess so.

11:38.195 --> 11:40.233
Anyway the place I'm talking about

11:40.234 --> 11:41.941
would be perfect for a salon.

11:42.525 --> 11:44.759
Um, that ship has sailed.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.860
The bank thinks I'm too much of a risk.

11:46.861 --> 11:50.214
But I don't. I saved up enough
money to cover the lease

11:50.215 --> 11:52.205
and whatever you need for the equipment.

11:52.764 --> 11:54.639
You and I going into business together

11:54.640 --> 11:57.339
- sounds like a very bad idea.
- No, just come with me.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.801
Look at the place.
It's big, full of light.

12:00.578 --> 12:01.642
You'll love it.

12:03.114 --> 12:04.972
I need to go to work.

12:08.324 --> 12:11.065
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I really do need a haircut.

12:16.142 --> 12:18.362
Um, I'll see what I can do. Come on.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.775
All right, come on, girls!

12:37.538 --> 12:40.050
I can't believe Daphne
quit Carlton for this.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.198
Honey, I know it's hard

12:41.199 --> 12:43.792
for you to watch her
play for another team.

12:44.025 --> 12:47.246
No, it is hard for me to watch
her not play for another team.

12:47.578 --> 12:50.286
You know how good she is.
I'm sure the coach'll put her in soon.

12:50.287 --> 12:51.690
Oh oh oh oh oh!

13:02.259 --> 13:03.529
Oh, hey!

13:06.023 --> 13:08.149
Uh, hey.

13:08.239 --> 13:10.030
- Hi, Regina.
- Did I miss anything?

13:10.031 --> 13:11.663
- No, you missed nothing.
- Okay.

13:11.664 --> 13:14.319
Okay, subs, next dead ball
we've got Jenna, Lucy,

13:14.320 --> 13:16.523
Gaby, Ava, Amelia... you're going in.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.764
Oh, sorry. That's what we do at
Carlton when the team scores.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.959
- Like this? Yay!
- Yes, just like that.

13:32.047 --> 13:35.124
- Whoo!
- Mom, you can stop doing that now.

13:35.136 --> 13:36.806
It's so much fun embarrassing them.

13:36.924 --> 13:38.208
Hey, mom, don't you have to

13:38.209 --> 13:39.838
go home and write or something?

13:40.210 --> 13:41.587
Oh, what are you writing?

13:41.675 --> 13:46.453
Oh, I'm just trying to
write about our situation,

13:46.454 --> 13:47.762
what it's like to be the mother of

13:47.762 --> 13:49.653
a child who was switched at birth.

13:50.195 --> 13:52.808
- You're starting a blog?
- Uh, no.

13:53.379 --> 13:55.924
- A book.
- About the switch.

13:55.944 --> 13:57.948
Well, that's the plan.

13:58.710 --> 14:01.278
Well, as the other mother whose
child was involved in the switch,

14:01.279 --> 14:03.708
- I'm not okay with that.
- Well actually, Regina...

14:03.709 --> 14:05.589
It's not gonna be salacious or anything.

14:05.590 --> 14:08.162
It's gonna be honest. It's gonna be real.

14:08.163 --> 14:10.043
I don't care what it is.
I don't want it written.

14:10.473 --> 14:12.204
I... I don't think I need your permission.

14:12.205 --> 14:14.189
I don't see how you're gonna
write it without my cooperation.

14:14.190 --> 14:15.870
I guess I'll find out.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.758
I just don't understand
what the point is.

14:19.408 --> 14:21.189
- I wanna tell my story.
- But why?

14:21.190 --> 14:24.014
What, you need more money or
you just wanna humiliate me?

14:24.015 --> 14:25.805
- Of course not.
- Then what?

14:28.838 --> 14:31.547
Sometimes you just get sick
of sitting on the bench.

14:36.022 --> 14:37.139
Yes!

14:48.033 --> 14:51.426
Hey, I've been texting you like crazy.

14:51.662 --> 14:52.963
Are you okay?

14:57.941 --> 15:00.377
Did she tell you that I came by?

15:00.378 --> 15:04.729
I wanna go to the police and
tell them that I'm responsible.

15:08.536 --> 15:09.780
But it was my piece.

15:15.195 --> 15:17.877
Right, but maybe if I tell them,

15:17.878 --> 15:19.839
they'll give you
like a lighter sentence if I just go...

15:28.067 --> 15:29.349
Okay.

15:33.697 --> 15:35.449
That must've hurt.

15:37.138 --> 15:37.946
Are you okay?

15:39.980 --> 15:43.313
What about us? Are we okay?

16:03.643 --> 16:05.422
You guys all made me so proud today.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.679
You left it all on the floor.
We got the victory,

16:07.680 --> 16:09.770
and that's the way a bulldog
does it. Bring it in.

16:09.771 --> 16:13.460
- Bulldogs on three. One, two, three.
- Bulldogs!

16:16.737 --> 16:19.683
Hey. So coach Medlock

16:19.684 --> 16:22.054
can take some time to warm up to somebody.

16:22.055 --> 16:24.526
So just hang in there.
You'll win him over.

16:25.706 --> 16:27.416
- Thanks.
- You will.

18:45.281 --> 18:46.605
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:46.606 --> 18:49.143
- Saw you at the game yesterday.
- You guys did good.

18:49.144 --> 18:50.585
Tyler country day is tough.

18:50.586 --> 18:52.762
You know, if you're planning
on making it a habit,

18:52.763 --> 18:54.749
I could hook you up with some pom-poms.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.597
Oh, I'll pass. Unless Daphne
gets some more playing time,

18:57.598 --> 18:58.961
I'm not gonna be at too many more games.

18:58.962 --> 19:01.401
That's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

19:01.402 --> 19:04.187
I think I know why coach
Medlock's not playing her.

20:52.914 --> 20:54.636
Hey, sorry to bother you.

20:54.637 --> 20:57.409
Do you have time to go over
the inbound plays again?

20:57.410 --> 21:00.373
I think coach Medlock's worried
that I don't know the plays.

21:00.833 --> 21:04.462
Um, I don't think that's the problem.

21:04.463 --> 21:07.981
- What do you mean?
- Coach Medlock's kind of a jerk.

21:08.045 --> 21:09.604
You know, he just has his favorites.

21:09.605 --> 21:11.206
I wouldn't take it personally.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.722
I'm trying not to. That's why
I want to run the plays with you.

21:18.737 --> 21:22.051
- What? What aren't you telling me?
- Nothing.

21:24.627 --> 21:26.882
You know I can tell when
you're hiding something.

21:30.605 --> 21:33.337
I have a friend whose dad
is on the Buckner board

21:33.338 --> 21:36.737
and said that they've been trying

21:36.738 --> 21:38.913
to raise money to upgrade
the locker rooms.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.069
And?

21:41.480 --> 21:43.987
And by putting you on the basketball team,

21:44.418 --> 21:47.934
Buckner qualifies for a $20,000 grant.

21:49.996 --> 21:51.584
How did that get them the grant?

21:52.135 --> 21:55.667
It's... it's for schools who encourage

21:55.668 --> 21:59.879
students with disabilities
to participate in sports.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.671
So the only reason that they wanted me

22:04.672 --> 22:07.090
on the team was because I'm deaf?

22:10.047 --> 22:11.300
But when coach came up to me,

22:11.301 --> 22:13.295
he acted like he thought I could play.

22:14.335 --> 22:16.784
I think the principal made
him put you on the team

22:16.785 --> 22:19.214
and now he's not playing
you because he feels

22:19.215 --> 22:20.937
like you were shoved down his throat.

22:20.938 --> 22:22.391
Shoved down his throat?

22:22.564 --> 22:25.084
But hey, in a couple of weeks,
it's not gonna matter anyway.

22:25.270 --> 22:27.507
You just gotta show him how good you are.

22:30.262 --> 22:31.206
Right.

22:44.123 --> 22:45.620
Hi Amanda, it's Kathryn Kennish.

22:45.621 --> 22:47.468
I just stopped by your office

22:47.469 --> 22:49.301
'cause I need to talk
to you about something.

22:49.389 --> 22:51.823
But I guess both you and your
assistant are out to lunch,

22:51.824 --> 22:54.312
so I guess I'll... oh!

23:02.072 --> 23:04.779
Wow. Uh...

23:07.011 --> 23:09.692
I guess I'll just schedule
something for another...

23:10.163 --> 23:12.009
Okay. Uh, bye.

23:22.431 --> 23:25.859
Hey, you boning up on
your souffle recipes?

23:26.110 --> 23:28.154
Just killing time before class.

23:28.966 --> 23:30.961
You wanna hang out tonight after practice?

23:31.181 --> 23:33.660
I don't think so.
I've got a lot of homework to do.

23:34.829 --> 23:37.469
Toby told you about the grant.

23:38.310 --> 23:39.932
Wait, you're the friend?

23:39.933 --> 23:41.716
The one whose dad's on the board?

23:42.679 --> 23:44.373
You went to Toby?

23:44.374 --> 23:46.165
Why didn't you just come to me directly?

23:46.166 --> 23:47.581
I know I should've. I'm sorry.

23:47.582 --> 23:49.943
I just didn't know what
I was gonna say to you.

23:49.944 --> 23:51.661
Is that why you want me on the team?

23:51.662 --> 23:53.391
I would never do something like that.

23:53.392 --> 23:56.581
I wanted you to join the team
because you're an amazing player.

23:58.502 --> 24:00.853
- Does everyone know?
- No.

24:01.268 --> 24:03.630
Look, I just happen to
have a dad who spends

24:03.631 --> 24:05.781
a lot of time and money on Buckner

24:05.782 --> 24:08.006
and is blessed with a loud phone voice.

24:08.879 --> 24:10.277
Seriously though,

24:10.340 --> 24:12.248
nobody else knows and we all think

24:12.249 --> 24:14.171
that coach Medlock should play you.

24:14.537 --> 24:17.888
It's just a matter of time
before he realizes that too.

24:33.627 --> 24:35.553
Some light reading I see.

24:36.179 --> 24:37.512
Do you want something?

24:38.248 --> 24:40.313
This is awkward and believe me,

24:40.314 --> 24:42.202
I wouldn't be coming to you,

24:42.203 --> 24:45.945
but I do not know who else I can ask so...

24:45.946 --> 24:49.076
I have to read three more chapters
of this before tomorrow so...

24:49.077 --> 24:51.098
Has Emmett said anything to you about me?

24:51.099 --> 24:54.276
Because I have been texting him
and he has not texted me back,

24:54.277 --> 24:57.626
which you probably love,
but I really need to know, okay?

24:57.627 --> 25:01.914
Is he mad at me or does Melody
have him on some sort of lockdown?

25:01.915 --> 25:05.046
You really think that everything
is about you, don't you?

25:05.047 --> 25:07.578
When someone is avoiding me, yeah, I do.

25:07.579 --> 25:09.523
He's upset about the arrest.

25:09.524 --> 25:12.483
- I know that but...
- You're never gonna get it.

25:12.484 --> 25:15.410
Okay, seriously,
will you just stop lording

25:15.411 --> 25:18.651
the whole you're-both-deaf-
and-I'm-not thing over me.

25:18.652 --> 25:21.873
The fact that you even think
it's something to "Lord over"

25:21.874 --> 25:24.795
just shows how really ignorant you are.

25:24.796 --> 25:27.403
Thanks for clearing everything up.

25:30.686 --> 25:32.661
It was a kiss kiss.

25:32.662 --> 25:35.316
Not a I-just-kicked-your-ass-
in-negotiations-on-behalf-

25:35.317 --> 25:36.981
of-the-Kennish-family-
and-now-I'm-giving-you-

25:36.982 --> 25:39.131
a-patronizing-goodbye kind of kiss?

25:39.132 --> 25:41.098
Unless that involves
a fair amount of tongue,

25:41.099 --> 25:43.101
I'd have to say no.

25:43.603 --> 25:45.934
This is a huge conflict of interest.

25:45.968 --> 25:47.157
Why didn't she say anything?

25:47.158 --> 25:50.078
You really think she'd let it
affect how she handles the case?

25:50.406 --> 25:52.831
I don't know. Who knows what she told him

25:52.832 --> 25:56.563
about the nurse or Angelo or...

25:57.487 --> 26:00.578
I just can't get over it,
and Dale of all people.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.165
I thought she was a lesbian.

26:04.166 --> 26:05.247
Really?

26:05.918 --> 26:07.199
What, 'cause of the haircut?

26:07.200 --> 26:09.942
No, I kinda thought
she had a crush on me.

26:10.711 --> 26:14.903
Sweetie, I think we've been
way off about a lot of things.

26:23.838 --> 26:25.517
Hitting the beach reading already?

26:25.869 --> 26:28.365
There is obviously a Kennish joke book.

26:28.366 --> 26:31.055
Shouldn't you be at basketball practice?

26:31.738 --> 26:32.876
What's the point?

26:33.084 --> 26:34.740
Coach Medlock's never gonna play me

26:34.741 --> 26:36.547
and it's not like he's gonna cut me.

26:36.548 --> 26:40.040
I'm their $20,000 ticket to new showers.

26:40.904 --> 26:41.702
Hey, I know it sucks,

26:41.703 --> 26:44.069
but try not to go to the bitter place.

26:45.096 --> 26:46.221
I'm not bitter.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.627
I'm disabled.

26:47.628 --> 26:49.611
It's a miracle I can even talk to you

26:49.612 --> 26:51.344
and hold this book at the same time.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.678
You never talk this way about being deaf.

26:55.136 --> 26:57.345
This is way more than one douchey coach.

26:57.346 --> 26:58.706
What's really going on?

27:21.868 --> 27:22.932
Daphne.

27:24.244 --> 27:26.117
Did you leave because I went deaf?

27:32.166 --> 27:33.630
Come in. Just come in.

27:33.631 --> 27:34.831
I just need to know.

27:36.399 --> 27:38.386
Did you leave because I lost my hearing?

27:38.907 --> 27:41.817
No. No, of course not.

27:42.845 --> 27:44.134
This was a stupid idea.

27:44.135 --> 27:45.807
Of course that's what you're gonna say.

27:46.926 --> 27:49.536
Daphne, come in. Let's just talk.

27:59.599 --> 28:00.705
Daphne, you hungry?

28:00.706 --> 28:03.076
I'm making soupe au pistou.

28:04.146 --> 28:05.566
Pesto soup?

28:05.967 --> 28:08.196
No, a vegetable... vegetable soup.

28:08.197 --> 28:10.125
And I heard you are a vegetarian,

28:10.126 --> 28:11.643
so it's perfect timing.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.312
Uh, I don't want any. I'm not hungry.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.692
You used to love it when you were a kid.

28:17.693 --> 28:19.483
You would scoop it up with your hands

28:19.484 --> 28:21.052
and put it all over your face.

28:28.706 --> 28:31.492
Did you used to sing
when you were cooking?

28:31.493 --> 28:33.961
Yeah, the crocodile song. I mean...

28:33.962 --> 28:36.949
Ah, les crococo,
les crococo, les crocodiles

28:36.950 --> 28:38.481
sur les bords du Nil.

28:40.207 --> 28:42.742
I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean... I didn't mean to...

28:42.743 --> 28:46.112
It's okay. You can sing in front of me.

28:47.593 --> 28:50.123
I mean, can... can you remember sound?

28:51.472 --> 28:52.592
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

28:52.593 --> 28:54.434
I don't wanna say the wrong thing.

28:54.528 --> 28:56.078
I really want this to work.

28:57.943 --> 28:59.296
Then tell me the truth.

29:00.671 --> 29:02.865
Did you leave because I lost my hearing?

29:03.596 --> 29:05.643
Because every time someone treats me

29:05.644 --> 29:08.678
like there's something wrong with me,
I go back to that place...

29:09.573 --> 29:10.633
A place where

29:12.090 --> 29:13.138
I blame myself

29:13.139 --> 29:15.765
for making you leave
and ruining everything.

29:17.332 --> 29:18.537
No, I left because

29:19.710 --> 29:21.080
you didn't look anything like me

29:21.081 --> 29:24.316
and I have Regina telling me over and over

29:24.317 --> 29:26.808
that you were mine, and I thought...

29:26.809 --> 29:28.230
I thought she was lying.

29:28.855 --> 29:32.215
So as soon as you found out
I wasn't yours, you just took off.

29:33.437 --> 29:34.451
No, it wasn't that simple.

29:34.452 --> 29:36.912
Regina and I always used
to fight all the time.

29:37.788 --> 29:39.843
- She... she was saying...
- And that's what happened.

29:40.756 --> 29:44.261
You found out I wasn't yours and you left.

29:44.312 --> 29:46.399
- Yes, but you have to understand...
- No no no,

29:46.400 --> 29:48.103
You have to understand.

29:48.104 --> 29:49.989
I was three.

29:50.522 --> 29:54.930
I didn't know anything about
D.N.A. tests or affairs.

29:54.968 --> 29:57.841
The only thing that I knew
is that the father that I had

29:57.842 --> 29:59.954
was there one day and gone the next.

30:01.962 --> 30:02.959
Sorry.

30:03.183 --> 30:04.324
It was a mistake.

30:05.365 --> 30:07.441
Tell me the truth.

30:09.915 --> 30:11.014
Please.

30:13.885 --> 30:15.936
Did you leave because I went deaf?

30:24.923 --> 30:26.308
Maybe a little.

30:32.248 --> 30:33.209
I'm sorry.

30:34.423 --> 30:36.067
Daphne, look, I'm sorry.

30:36.219 --> 30:38.019
- Just... let's talk about it.
- No.

30:40.756 --> 30:41.821
But thank you

30:43.826 --> 30:45.205
for being honest.

30:57.419 --> 30:58.366
Regina.

30:59.029 --> 31:00.012
Do you have a minute?

31:00.013 --> 31:02.596
- Sure.
- I heard a rather unfortunate rumor

31:02.597 --> 31:03.955
that you were thinking
of opening up a salon

31:03.956 --> 31:06.457
of your own not too far from here.

31:06.687 --> 31:07.699
That's ridiculous.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.677
The real estate broker

31:09.677 --> 31:12.558
whose bald spot I slave
to hide on a weekly basis

31:12.559 --> 31:14.013
would beg to differ.

31:15.048 --> 31:16.937
Even if I were thinking
something like that,

31:16.938 --> 31:20.230
- there's no way I could afford it.
- I took a chance hiring you.

31:20.438 --> 31:23.315
Stealing my clients and
becoming my competition

31:23.316 --> 31:25.285
would not be the way to repay me.

31:25.445 --> 31:28.140
Well, that's funny. I thought
the fact that I was booked solid

31:28.141 --> 31:28.797
and brought in at least

31:28.798 --> 31:31.438
10 new clients was my way of repaying you.

31:37.417 --> 31:38.435
Ooh.

31:39.809 --> 31:40.913
I'm glad you called.

31:40.914 --> 31:43.072
There's something I need
to talk to you two about.

31:43.542 --> 31:45.279
Does it have anything to do with the fact

31:45.280 --> 31:46.785
that you're involved with a member

31:46.786 --> 31:48.754
of the hospital's board of directors?

31:49.978 --> 31:51.256
You mean Dale?

31:52.043 --> 31:54.559
Are you seeing more than
one member of the board?

31:55.762 --> 31:57.919
We don't talk about the case

31:57.920 --> 32:01.063
or anything that could conceivably
be related to it.

32:01.064 --> 32:04.065
It is a giant conflict of interest.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.673
John, we've known each other
since I was in law school.

32:07.674 --> 32:11.084
My dad negotiated your first
major league contract.

32:12.199 --> 32:15.455
There is no conflict.
I am always on your side.

32:15.456 --> 32:17.938
But see, we're sitting
here and we're wondering

32:17.939 --> 32:20.178
why you were so eager to
take the hospital settlement,

32:20.179 --> 32:22.414
and why you didn't want
to believe that nurse

32:22.415 --> 32:24.985
and why you were so reluctant

32:24.986 --> 32:26.739
to join forces with
Angelo and his attorney.

32:26.740 --> 32:29.326
Okay, now wait a minute... wait.
I was reluctant

32:29.327 --> 32:31.354
because I had concerns about Angelo.

32:31.355 --> 32:33.740
- I still do.
- Yeah, it's just

32:33.885 --> 32:35.992
I don't know how we don't second-guess

32:35.993 --> 32:39.537
every piece of advice you've given us,
every move you make.

32:42.235 --> 32:45.500
So are you letting me go?

32:50.145 --> 32:51.897
I think we are, Amanda.

32:57.215 --> 33:00.423
Okay, umm,

33:00.424 --> 33:01.965
I'll have all the files

33:01.966 --> 33:04.454
and relevant material
sent over to you today.

33:12.332 --> 33:15.395
Make the hospital pay. They deserve to.

34:26.795 --> 34:27.978
Stopping by to remind me

34:27.980 --> 34:30.242
how insensitive and ignorant I am?

34:31.927 --> 34:34.485
I just thought you should know...

34:39.933 --> 34:41.507
I saw Angelo.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.422
How did that go?

34:46.302 --> 34:47.409
It was hard.

34:49.781 --> 34:52.462
Did he apologize, explain why he left?

34:54.061 --> 34:55.166
He tried.

34:57.389 --> 35:00.337
- And?
- There's really no good way

35:00.338 --> 35:04.149
to say you're sorry for
being weak, that...

35:05.557 --> 35:08.574
you didn't bother to
fight for somebody else.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.616
So you still hate him.

35:15.595 --> 35:17.996
Why is it so important to you?

35:18.257 --> 35:20.672
I don't know! I...

35:21.723 --> 35:22.970
I guess 'cause,

35:23.382 --> 35:26.664
you know, he technically is my dad and...

35:28.346 --> 35:30.083
I want to know what you think.

35:31.468 --> 35:32.652
I guess...

35:34.275 --> 35:35.866
I feel sorry for him.

35:38.260 --> 35:40.934
I'm not just trying to dump
on him to make you feel bad.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.218
I know, but...

35:44.207 --> 35:46.072
it's just you happen to hit the jackpot

35:46.073 --> 35:49.466
in the bio-dad department.

35:56.713 --> 35:59.845
- Hey, sweetie.
- Do you have a second?

36:01.243 --> 36:03.689
Yeah. What's going on?

36:07.792 --> 36:11.448
You saw it. I'm kind of having
a tough time on the Buckner team.

36:12.441 --> 36:14.164
Those girls are a little
tougher to play with

36:14.165 --> 36:15.680
than you might have thought, huh?

36:17.131 --> 36:19.687
I don't think I'm gonna get
to play a game all season.

36:20.551 --> 36:21.780
What are you talking about?

36:21.781 --> 36:23.872
Do something to piss off coach Medlock?

36:24.372 --> 36:26.582
No, it's not something I did.

36:27.543 --> 36:28.782
I found out...

36:33.157 --> 36:35.615
I was just wondering
if you'd be willing to coach me,

36:35.616 --> 36:38.546
because if I'm not twice as
good as every girl on that team,

36:38.547 --> 36:40.953
I'm gonna spend the entire
season on the bench.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.338
I can maybe find the time,

36:42.339 --> 36:44.579
but you know, I do have to warn you

36:45.156 --> 36:48.466
certain ex-players of mine have
been known to call me "Hard-ass."

36:51.219 --> 36:52.248
That's okay.

36:53.955 --> 36:56.849
- So will you do it?
- Of course I'll do it.

36:56.850 --> 36:59.315
- Be a pleasure.
- Thanks.

37:15.410 --> 37:16.373
Hi.

37:17.250 --> 37:18.194
Hi.

37:21.371 --> 37:23.196
Trying to get your attention.

37:25.784 --> 37:27.842
Okay, just come down here, okay?

37:27.950 --> 37:30.428
I have something that I want to show you.

37:33.581 --> 37:35.020
Was that "Rap sheet"?

37:37.462 --> 37:39.797
Love it when you speak con,

37:39.798 --> 37:42.359
but don't worry, okay?

37:42.486 --> 37:44.420
It's not illegal

37:45.159 --> 37:48.983
and I am not taking "No" for an answer.

38:03.391 --> 38:05.115
I wanna give the salon a shot.

38:08.104 --> 38:10.191
- You do?
- I can't work for Geraldo anymore.

38:10.192 --> 38:12.440
He's patronizing, vindictive and...

38:12.486 --> 38:14.914
Gina, wait, don't quit your job.

38:15.159 --> 38:17.340
I don't think we can do it...

38:17.341 --> 38:18.560
I mean together

38:19.569 --> 38:21.409
Daphne came to see me today.

38:21.991 --> 38:24.697
She did? She came here?

38:24.861 --> 38:26.687
Yeah, and it was a disaster.

38:27.058 --> 38:29.660
- What happened?
- I tried to explain to her

38:29.661 --> 38:32.607
that my leaving had
nothing to do with her,

38:32.608 --> 38:35.603
but that made her angrier.

38:35.604 --> 38:37.724
Huh. I can't believe she came here.

38:37.758 --> 38:39.978
You heard me saying it
was a disaster, right?

38:39.979 --> 38:42.322
Of course it was. She's been
mad at you for 13 years.

38:42.323 --> 38:44.055
It's not gonna go away in an afternoon.

38:45.969 --> 38:49.227
- Think she will ever forgive me?
- I think so.

38:51.492 --> 38:52.619
I hope so.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.958
Okay, wait wait, look look... I know

39:14.959 --> 39:17.919
that getting arrested sucked

39:18.552 --> 39:20.118
and you're mad

39:20.848 --> 39:23.522
at me, at the police...

39:24.727 --> 39:26.561
I don't really know at who

39:26.562 --> 39:31.047
and according to Daphne,
I will never really get it.

39:31.623 --> 39:34.543
But I wish that you would try and explain.

39:37.860 --> 39:38.991
No, I do.

39:40.774 --> 39:41.910
Try me.

39:54.024 --> 39:55.034
Okay.

39:57.973 --> 39:59.862
But here's the thing.

40:01.074 --> 40:05.057
Nobody is better at being
mad at the world than I am.

40:05.512 --> 40:07.626
I've had 16 years of practice at it.

40:09.088 --> 40:10.739
And it's a lot more fun

40:10.740 --> 40:13.199
being angry together

40:13.631 --> 40:14.680
than alone.

40:50.300 --> 40:52.562
Just 'cause we can't do street art

40:53.782 --> 40:57.199
doesn't mean we can't do street art.

41:11.272 --> 41:13.407
Those files arrived from Amanda's office.

41:13.408 --> 41:15.281
Do you want to put them in
the study or the garage?

41:15.282 --> 41:18.698
- You should look at that one.
- Why? What's in it?

41:19.145 --> 41:22.275
Amanda's private investigator
ran a report on Angelo.

41:22.746 --> 41:25.090
After October of 2009,

41:25.563 --> 41:27.190
he just disappeared.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.183
Disappeared? What do you mean?

41:29.386 --> 41:32.585
- He's here.
- I mean there is no record

41:32.586 --> 41:34.824
of an Angelo Sorrento anywhere.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.951
No credit card charges, no phone bills,

41:36.952 --> 41:39.264
no mailing address... nothing.

41:39.603 --> 41:41.049
It's like two years ago

41:41.203 --> 41:43.316
he just fell off the face of the Earth.

41:44.399 --> 41:45.529
What was he doing?

41:47.585 --> 41:49.127
Obviously something he didn't want

41:49.128 --> 41:50.848
anybody else ot know about.

41:54.051 --> 41:55.337
So what I was thinking is that

41:55.338 --> 41:57.859
you could put the waiting area here,

41:58.149 --> 41:59.948
the sinks over here

41:59.949 --> 42:01.821
and it would leave you all this space

42:01.822 --> 42:04.715
- to put the chairs and the mirrors.
- And it has skylights?

42:04.999 --> 42:07.368
Yeah, it has everything you always wanted.

42:07.419 --> 42:10.413
Now the only question is,
what will you name it?

42:10.414 --> 42:12.557
Gina's? Paloma's?

42:12.916 --> 42:13.717
Estilio?

42:13.718 --> 42:15.205
How do you know what I'm thinking about?

42:15.206 --> 42:16.497
Do you remember all those
times we were walking

42:16.498 --> 42:19.051
down at that old barber
shop on 8th street?

42:19.052 --> 42:20.808
- Oh.
- And you'd stop by it and say

42:20.809 --> 42:22.762
what would you do to
this place once you have it?

42:22.763 --> 42:25.766
- Are you sure you can afford this?
- Yes, and it's the least

42:25.767 --> 42:26.888
I can do after leaving

42:26.889 --> 42:28.789
you to take care of
Daphne all those years.

42:30.124 --> 42:32.297
Gina's... that's what I'm gonna go with.

42:32.298 --> 42:33.374
All right.

42:34.392 --> 42:37.704
- What... is that...
- Oh. Yeah.

42:38.633 --> 42:41.658
"I like it like that." Do you
remember at your cousin's wedding?

42:42.472 --> 42:43.648
Yeah, we didn't realize

42:43.649 --> 42:45.177
it was supposed to be the first dance.

42:45.178 --> 42:47.871
We didn't know.
Everybody was staring at us.

42:47.872 --> 42:50.212
Oh, she didn't talk to me for a month.

42:50.272 --> 42:52.071
Nope, she didn't.

42:54.300 --> 42:56.523
- Oh no.
- Come on.

42:56.896 --> 42:59.529
- Really?
- What, you forgot?

42:59.530 --> 43:01.920
No. Maybe.

43:04.103 --> 43:05.217
Okay.
