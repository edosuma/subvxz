00:02.281 --> 00:04.319
[doctor] Everything looks good,
Mr. Reynolds.

00:04.352 --> 00:06.489
Your blood work is all normal.

00:06.523 --> 00:08.494
[Dennis]
Excellent. As expected, right?

00:08.527 --> 00:10.297
Does look like
your blood pressure's

00:10.330 --> 00:12.569
-a little high, however. Um--
-Wait.

00:12.602 --> 00:14.807
-I have high blood pressure?
-Well, yes, but

00:14.840 --> 00:16.611
that's consistent
with your last visit.

00:16.644 --> 00:18.313
We might want
to put you on a low dose

00:18.346 --> 00:20.585
-of blood pressure medication.
-Oh... no.

00:20.618 --> 00:22.824
[scoffs] Come on, Doc.
Pills are for old men.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.427
Well, we all get
to a certain age where we need--

00:25.461 --> 00:26.832
Do we? I don't.

00:26.865 --> 00:29.236
So, no. I mean, you know,
let-let's not...

00:29.269 --> 00:30.539
Listen, I-I can see
where you're headed with this.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.309
Let's-let's not go there, okay?

00:32.342 --> 00:34.480
If I wanted my blood pressure
to be low, I would simply

00:34.514 --> 00:36.685
command my body to make it low.

00:36.718 --> 00:39.123
That's really not how chronic
high blood pressure works.

00:39.156 --> 00:41.628
Okay, well, it is how it works
with Dennis Reynolds, okay?

00:41.661 --> 00:43.732
And if I'm chronically
having high blood pressure,

00:43.765 --> 00:45.468
it's because
I'm chronically suffering fools

00:45.502 --> 00:47.573
who won't listen to me
when I say that I can do things.

00:47.606 --> 00:50.312
Uh, you know what, Doc?
It's fi...

00:50.345 --> 00:52.617
I'm gonna take control
of this, okay?

00:52.650 --> 00:54.186
Don't you worry about a thing

00:54.219 --> 00:56.123
'cause Dennis Reynolds is gonna

00:56.156 --> 00:58.193
figure this all out on his own.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.444
[beeping]

01:23.477 --> 01:24.881
There we go.

01:24.914 --> 01:26.585
Blood pressure.

01:26.618 --> 01:29.591
Pulse. Resting heart rate,
syncs right to the phone.

01:29.624 --> 01:31.293
And it records everything.

01:31.326 --> 01:33.297
[laughs]
This is perfect.

01:33.330 --> 01:36.137
Now I'll have proof I can smash
in that stupid doctor's face.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.708
[phone ringing, buzzing]

01:41.346 --> 01:43.585
-Yeah.
- [Charlie] Oh, hey, Dennis.

01:43.618 --> 01:45.856
Uh, a-are we above
or below sea level?

01:45.889 --> 01:47.459
-What?
[Frank] Tell him about
the family-style cooking.

01:47.493 --> 01:49.196
[Charlie]
Yeah, so we're doing

01:49.229 --> 01:50.599
some family-style cooking now,
and we got this,

01:50.632 --> 01:52.335
like, industrial-grade
pressure cooker.

01:52.368 --> 01:53.739
-[Frank] Mm.
-[Charlie] Pretty badass, man,

01:53.772 --> 01:55.341
but, you know,
we got to make sure

01:55.374 --> 01:56.712
we're above sea level
just to be safe.

01:56.745 --> 01:57.847
Well, we can't be
below sea level.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.383
Otherwise, we'd be underwater.

01:59.416 --> 02:00.786
[Frank]
But if it's under sea level,

02:00.819 --> 02:02.355
-it may explode.
-That's our big worry.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.859
That this sucker's
gonna explode.

02:03.892 --> 02:04.861
You can't take
a pressure cooker under the sea.

02:04.894 --> 02:06.565
It's not gonna explode.

02:06.598 --> 02:08.468
Yeah, that's not
how pressure cookers works.

02:08.502 --> 02:09.871
-Yeah.
-You're telling me
that you can't bring

02:09.904 --> 02:11.474
a pressure cooker
onto a submarine?

02:11.508 --> 02:13.612
How do they feed
the entire U.S. Navy?

02:13.645 --> 02:15.348
-They don't pressure-cook
the shit, Mac.
-Navy argument.

02:15.381 --> 02:17.219
-Navy argument...
-Stop! Stop! All of you, okay?

02:17.252 --> 02:18.321
[Charlie]
They have, like,
a grill or something.

02:18.354 --> 02:19.624
I'm calling mental health day.

02:19.657 --> 02:21.495
[Frank]
Mental health day?

02:21.528 --> 02:23.231
What kind
of cuckoo shit is that?

02:23.264 --> 02:24.868
[Dee] It's a new thing.
It's like a sick day

02:24.901 --> 02:26.805
but for your brain,
and if somebody calls it,

02:26.838 --> 02:28.742
you have to give it to 'em,
you can't ask any questions.

02:28.775 --> 02:30.646
Are you calling that?
Are you taking that for real?

02:30.679 --> 02:33.919
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm calling
mental health day, okay?

02:33.952 --> 02:36.290
-And I'm gonna drive out
to the beach...
-[Dee] Ooh.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.495
...and spend the entire day
just staring at the ocean.

02:38.528 --> 02:40.265
Isn't your car in the shop?
I'm sorry.

02:40.298 --> 02:41.400
That's, uh, not a question
about mental health.

02:41.433 --> 02:42.770
That's a question of logistics.

02:42.803 --> 02:44.541
Ah, damn it. No, you're right.

02:44.574 --> 02:45.643
[Dee]
Hey, Dennis,
I'll come drive you.

02:45.676 --> 02:47.345
I could use a beach day.

02:47.378 --> 02:49.517
Oh, shit. You know what?
This could be a good way

02:49.550 --> 02:51.220
-to find out whether or not
we're, uh, underwater.
-[beeping]

02:51.253 --> 02:52.790
[Frank] We can take
the cooker there, yeah.

02:52.823 --> 02:54.259
-[Dee] We're gonna bring
the cooker, too.
-No. No.

02:54.292 --> 02:55.663
Goddamn it!
Do you hear that beeping?

02:55.696 --> 02:57.432
-[overlapping chatter]
-That means stop. No!

02:57.465 --> 02:58.669
This is my mental health day,
and none of you

02:58.702 --> 03:00.639
are a part of it.
Goddamn it!

03:00.672 --> 03:02.409

03:03.444 --> 03:04.981
Hi.

03:05.014 --> 03:06.718
Hi. How can I help you today?

03:06.751 --> 03:08.722
Uh, yeah, I have a reservation
under the name Reynolds.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.260
-Okay, let me check that out
for you.
-All right.

03:11.293 --> 03:13.263
[rapid typing]

03:22.550 --> 03:24.654
Wow. That's a lot of typing
you're having to do there.

03:24.687 --> 03:26.858
-You writing a novel?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

03:26.891 --> 03:29.564
We have no more vehicles
available in that class.

03:29.597 --> 03:31.433
No, no, no,
I made a reservation.

03:31.466 --> 03:32.837
Sometimes
our system double-books,

03:32.870 --> 03:35.008
so that's our mistake,
and we are happy

03:35.041 --> 03:37.947
-to offer you
a complimentary upgrade.
-Okay.

03:37.980 --> 03:41.020
This is the Tsuma EVS,
a fully-electric car

03:41.053 --> 03:42.757
with touch screen controls,
automated steering

03:42.790 --> 03:44.426
made right here in America.

03:44.459 --> 03:46.565
Oh, these are awesome.
I've seen these.

03:46.598 --> 03:48.301
-These are really cool.
-Mm-hmm.

03:48.334 --> 03:51.440
Okay, yeah, no. I-I... I accept,
and I'll take those keys.

03:51.473 --> 03:53.946
-There are no keys.
-Aha.

03:53.979 --> 03:56.685
-There's an app.
-Oh, right.

03:56.718 --> 03:58.822
-An app.
-Mm-hmm.

03:58.855 --> 04:01.460
Boy, I got tell you, I...
I, uh, I don't love that.

04:01.494 --> 04:04.333
I, uh, have a lot of apps
on my phone already,

04:04.366 --> 04:06.571
and, uh,
keys are sort of a system

04:06.604 --> 04:08.474
that have existed for millennia.

04:08.508 --> 04:10.613
I don't know why we're trying
to fix that, but, uh,

04:10.646 --> 04:12.015
yeah, no, now we got apps.

04:12.048 --> 04:13.619
We got... we got apps
for everything, right?

04:13.652 --> 04:15.488
Even for things
we already had things for.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.025
-[watch beeping]
-[laughing]

04:17.058 --> 04:18.896
I guess, uh, since
my blood pressure's going up,

04:18.929 --> 04:21.000
really spiking here,
I'm just gonna...

04:21.033 --> 04:23.004
I'm gonna go with it.
We're gonna download the app.

04:23.037 --> 04:25.041
Right? What's one more app?
[laughs]

04:25.074 --> 04:28.280
The phone is the key now.
Simple.

04:30.786 --> 04:33.492
This is nice.
Smooth ride, it's quiet.

04:33.525 --> 04:36.030
Try this
automated steering thing.

04:36.063 --> 04:38.601

Hey.

04:41.541 --> 04:44.046
Hey! [laughs]

04:44.079 --> 04:46.383
That is awesome.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.389
Time to kick
this mental health day off

04:49.422 --> 04:51.494
with some feel-good plant tonic.

04:51.527 --> 04:55.368
My good friend, Mr. Kratom.

04:55.401 --> 04:57.907
Uh, this stuff's gnarly
as hell, though.

04:57.940 --> 05:00.044
I need some...
some kind of a mixer.

05:00.077 --> 05:05.054
Uh, Tsuma, direct me
to the nearest tea shop.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.025
-[car chimes]
-[male voice]
Rerouting to Teaspoon.

05:07.058 --> 05:09.029
Holy shit.

Tsuma, play... Roxette.

05:13.404 --> 05:15.041

I'll just sit here
and enjoy the ride, I guess.

[Charlie]
Dee tried to tell us
not to eat it, but look, anyway,

08:44.760 --> 08:46.898
we're just calling now so
you don't get mad at us later.

08:46.931 --> 08:48.602
-All right?
-[Mac] Yeah, we're hoping
that you get mad out there

08:48.635 --> 08:49.971
and then you come back
and you're happy.

08:50.004 --> 08:51.608
[Charlie]
Do not expect that sandwich

08:51.641 --> 08:53.645
when you get back,
'cause it's gone, okay?

08:53.678 --> 08:56.016
[Mac] But don't worry about it.
It has been pressure-cooked.

08:56.049 --> 08:58.020
-[Charlie] Yeah, we pressure-
cooked the shit out of it.
-What do you mean?

08:58.053 --> 09:00.024
-No, you cannot pressure-cook
a French dip.
-[car horn honks]

09:00.057 --> 09:01.861
[Mac] Oh, yeah, you can, and
I guarantee that the U.S. Navy

09:01.894 --> 09:03.598
-is down on their submarine...
-Don't. Don't talk!

09:03.631 --> 09:05.201
-Don't talk. Don't. Stop.
-...with their pressure cooker.

09:05.234 --> 09:06.671
-No more phone calls! No more!
-[overlapping chatter]

09:06.704 --> 09:07.305
-[watch beeps off]
-[Dennis sighs]

09:07.338 --> 09:08.207
[siren toots]

09:08.240 --> 09:09.042
[car's chiming continues]

09:09.075 --> 09:11.781
[siren toots]

09:11.814 --> 09:12.849
Fantastic.

09:17.358 --> 09:19.062
[indistinct radio transmission]

09:19.095 --> 09:20.231
Hello, Officer.

09:20.264 --> 09:21.935
License and registration.

09:21.968 --> 09:24.105
-Uh, well, this is a rental,
actually.
-Hmm.

09:24.138 --> 09:25.909
-Turn the car off.
-[chiming continues]

09:25.942 --> 09:28.113
[laughs]
Yeah.

09:28.146 --> 09:31.921
I, uh... I can't
because I don't have a key.

09:31.954 --> 09:34.326
Uh, well, technically
there is no key.

09:34.359 --> 09:36.831
My phone is the key, and...

09:36.864 --> 09:39.035
I don't have a phone.

09:40.004 --> 09:41.340
Step out of the car, sir.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.745
Uh, you know,
I'd really rather not

09:43.778 --> 09:45.849
because I'm afraid if I get out,
then, um,

09:45.882 --> 09:47.887
I'm not gonna be able
to start the car again.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.991
Sir, out of the car, please.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.861
-[chiming]
-[watch beeping]

09:51.894 --> 09:54.199
Right. You don't care.

09:54.232 --> 09:56.804
All right, stepping out.

09:56.837 --> 09:59.041
[chiming and beeping continue]

10:05.989 --> 10:07.225
[car horn toots]

10:07.258 --> 10:10.665
Well,
who could've predicted that?

10:14.138 --> 10:17.011
Hi. Good afternoon. Fine,
and you? Thanks for asking.

10:17.044 --> 10:18.748
Listen, my name is
Dennis Reynolds,

10:18.781 --> 10:20.919
and I'm on a family plan
under the name Frank Reynolds,

10:20.952 --> 10:22.322
and I need a new phone, please.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.125
Okay, I can help you
with that here.

10:24.158 --> 10:25.762
Great.

10:25.795 --> 10:27.833
-Frank Reynolds, mm-hmm.
-[rapid typing]

10:31.741 --> 10:33.879
-My name's not that long.
-So,

10:33.912 --> 10:35.983
looks like I can get you
a replacement phone here.

10:36.016 --> 10:37.887
Can have it to you
by end of day tomorrow.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.391
Uh, no, that's-that's not
gonna work. I need it today.

10:40.424 --> 10:43.363
Unfortunately, the phones are
at our warehouse, so...

10:44.332 --> 10:46.403
Tell me about those,

10:46.436 --> 10:47.940
'cause those look like phones.

10:47.973 --> 10:49.276
Those aren't the phones.

10:49.309 --> 10:50.746
-Those aren't the phones?
-No.

10:50.779 --> 10:52.448
Hey, those aren't
the phones, guys, so,

10:52.481 --> 10:54.185
you know, just so you know.
Those are just boxes

10:54.218 --> 10:56.290
filled with phones
that aren't the phones.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.394
-Phones for new customers.
-Oh, for new customer, right.

10:58.427 --> 11:00.732
Not for old customers.
Not for the paying customers,

11:00.765 --> 11:02.068
the people who have been paying
for months and months,

11:02.101 --> 11:03.470
for years and years
and years and years.

11:03.504 --> 11:05.074
Let's punish those people
and give the phones

11:05.107 --> 11:06.811
that are right there
to the new customers.

11:06.844 --> 11:08.213
It's just how the system works.

11:08.246 --> 11:09.917
-Yeah, well, mm, that system.
-[watch beeping]

11:09.950 --> 11:11.754
I've been
running up against it all day.

11:11.787 --> 11:14.426
Well, I'll tell you what, pal.
I am not mad at you, okay?

11:14.459 --> 11:16.196
I am mad at the system.

11:16.229 --> 11:18.467
Okay, but unfortunately
the system isn't here

11:18.501 --> 11:21.941
for me to direct my frustrations
at it, s...

11:21.974 --> 11:24.312
[Dennis inhales deeply]

11:24.345 --> 11:26.249
[exhales]

11:26.282 --> 11:29.222
Good. Let's try something else.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.828
Um, what if we add a new line

11:31.861 --> 11:33.297
to the Frank Reynolds
family plan?

11:33.330 --> 11:34.934
Would that make me
a new customer?

11:34.967 --> 11:37.238
Yeah, I can do that.
I just need your PIN.

11:37.271 --> 11:38.775
Right, 'cause the PIN's the key
to the phone,

11:38.808 --> 11:40.111
and the phone's the key
to the car,

11:40.144 --> 11:41.948
and everything's been
streamlined.

11:41.981 --> 11:44.820
Excuse me, please. I need
to make a call on my watch.

11:44.853 --> 11:46.524
-Are you sure
this is gonna work?
-Charlie,

11:46.557 --> 11:48.260
diamonds are made
under pressure.

11:48.293 --> 11:49.930
This is a pressure cooker.

11:49.963 --> 11:52.001
We're going to cook diamonds.
It's very linear.

11:52.034 --> 11:53.872
-[phone buzzing]
-So genius.

11:53.905 --> 11:55.341
I just can't believe no one's
ever thought of this before.

11:55.374 --> 11:56.476
-We're gonna be rich, man.
-[Dee] Oh, I know.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.080
It's Dennis.

11:58.113 --> 11:59.517
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
do not answer it.

11:59.550 --> 12:02.221
-It's a mental health day test.
-A test. Mm.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.858
-Test?
-Mm-hmm.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.929
In my day, if you wanted
to get out of work, you...

12:05.962 --> 12:07.465
you hit yourself with a hammer

12:07.499 --> 12:10.071
or you got gnawed by a shark
or something simple.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.075
-[line ringing]
-No, not gonna pick up now.

12:12.108 --> 12:14.212
No, wh-wh-why would he?
Unreal.

12:14.245 --> 12:18.253
Uh, let's try... 69-69.

12:18.286 --> 12:20.024
[laughs softly]
Okay.

12:20.057 --> 12:22.496
-[typing]
-Yeah, that's it.
-That worked?

12:22.529 --> 12:23.965
You're all set.

12:23.998 --> 12:25.368
-Seriously?
-That's it.

12:25.401 --> 12:27.005
-This is the phone?
-That's the phone.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.273
I'm gonna open the box,
I'm gonna turn it on,

12:28.306 --> 12:29.376
-the phone's going to work?
-Yup.

12:29.409 --> 12:31.013
It's gonna work.
It's your phone.

12:31.046 --> 12:32.382
Whoo!

12:32.415 --> 12:34.419
[screams]

12:34.452 --> 12:36.557
Why won't you talk
to each other?!

12:36.590 --> 12:40.565
Talk! Talk! Talk! Talk!

12:40.598 --> 12:43.003
Talk! Talk!

12:43.036 --> 12:45.007
Dennis Reynolds.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.546
D, E, "N" as in Nancy...

[smooth jazz version of "Listen
to Your Heart" playing on phone]

12:58.033 --> 12:59.870
[male automated voice]
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

12:59.903 --> 13:01.473
Yeah, no, I know you didn't
get it 'cause I didn't say it.

13:01.507 --> 13:03.010
I didn't say what it was.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.547
Did you say "January"?

13:04.580 --> 13:06.149
No, I didn't say "January."
I didn't say anything.

13:06.182 --> 13:07.886
I didn't give a month,
I didn't give a day.

13:07.919 --> 13:10.157
Representative.
No, representative.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.426
Human! Human!

13:11.459 --> 13:12.896
Oh.

13:12.929 --> 13:15.134
[music resumes]

13:15.167 --> 13:16.571

"N" as in "nightmare"!
"I" as in "Is this real?!"

13:33.370 --> 13:35.609
"S" as in "Somebody help me!"

13:35.642 --> 13:38.080
There has to be a way
to open this goddamn car!

13:38.113 --> 13:40.184
How do I open the car?!

13:40.217 --> 13:42.054
[beeping]

13:42.087 --> 13:44.593
Dennis Reynolds. [sighs]

13:44.626 --> 13:47.098
D, E,

13:47.131 --> 13:50.304

-[male voice]
Thank you for calling

13:52.208 --> 13:54.112
-Tsuma Customer Care.
-[Dennis] Never gonna help me.

13:54.145 --> 13:55.181
[male voice]
Your call is
very important to us.

13:55.214 --> 13:57.017
Please enter your 17-digit VIN.

13:59.388 --> 14:01.126
Please say your name.

14:01.159 --> 14:04.199
-Dennis Reynolds.
-Got it. Let me transfer you.

14:04.232 --> 14:06.203
[line ringing]

14:06.236 --> 14:08.407
[Daisy]
Thank you
for calling Tsuma Customer Care.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.346
My name is Daisy. May I please
have your name and 17-digit VIN?

14:11.379 --> 14:12.983
No. No, no, no, no. No.

14:13.016 --> 14:15.254
I just ent... I ju...

14:15.287 --> 14:18.060
I just entered all that
information into the system.

14:18.093 --> 14:19.630
I'm sorry, sir.

14:19.663 --> 14:21.399
-I get it, but I do--
-That-That's okay. No, no.

14:21.432 --> 14:23.237
That's okay. Daisy, was it?

14:23.270 --> 14:26.476
Listen, don't be sorry, okay?
I'm not mad at you.

14:26.510 --> 14:29.215
I'm a little upset, but I'm
upset at the situation, okay?

14:29.248 --> 14:31.019
And-and the situation is this,
Daisy.

14:31.052 --> 14:32.990
If you'll just give me a second
and indulge me, okay?

14:33.023 --> 14:37.031
[sighs]
My new phone won't talk
to my car.

14:37.064 --> 14:39.369
Okay, so I called
the car rental company,

14:39.402 --> 14:41.306
and they put me on
with a supervisor

14:41.339 --> 14:42.643
who told me
to call Tsuma Roadside,

14:42.676 --> 14:44.179
so I called Tsuma Roadside.

14:44.212 --> 14:45.515
Spoke to someone over there

14:45.548 --> 14:47.118
who put me on
with another supervisor

14:47.151 --> 14:48.521
who told me
to call the service center.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.124
So I called the service center,
spoke to about--

14:50.157 --> 14:51.661
I don't know--
two, three morons over there

14:51.694 --> 14:53.363
who had no answers
for me whatsoever.

14:53.396 --> 14:55.367
They put me on
with one of their supervisors,

14:55.400 --> 14:58.240
and that person told me to call
the car rental company again.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.677
So I called
the car rental company,

14:59.710 --> 15:02.315
then roadside, service center,
rental company,

15:02.348 --> 15:04.185
roadside, service center,
rental company,

15:04.218 --> 15:05.655
roadside, service center,
and around and around

15:05.688 --> 15:07.325
and around like that
for hours and hours,

15:07.358 --> 15:09.128
until finally someone had
the presence of mind

15:09.161 --> 15:10.999
to let me know there's
a goddamn customer care line.

15:11.032 --> 15:12.536
Okay, so I called
the customer care line

15:12.569 --> 15:15.007
and now I find myself talking
to you, Daisy,

15:15.040 --> 15:16.577
my little wildflower.

15:16.610 --> 15:19.315
And you ask me
to enter in my VIN

15:19.348 --> 15:21.052
and my date of birth again,

15:21.085 --> 15:23.725
information which I already
entered into your system.

15:23.758 --> 15:26.196
Okay, now, now, listen,
Daisy, Daisy,

15:26.229 --> 15:28.535
bear with me here, okay?

15:28.568 --> 15:31.072
I know you didn't create
the system, okay?

15:31.105 --> 15:33.043
So you are not to blame.

15:33.076 --> 15:35.682
But somebody did create
the system,

15:35.715 --> 15:38.086
and I would very much like
to blame that person.

15:38.119 --> 15:40.692
So... who is that?

15:40.725 --> 15:42.696
Sir, I'm sorry. Who is...?

15:42.729 --> 15:44.700
Who is the person who created
your customer service system

15:44.733 --> 15:46.236
in such a way

15:46.269 --> 15:47.639
that the information entered

15:47.672 --> 15:49.475
into the computer
isn't passed on

15:49.509 --> 15:51.514
to the human representative?!

15:51.547 --> 15:53.350
Sir, I don't know. I can send
you to one of my supervisors.

15:53.383 --> 15:54.720
No, no, no, no, no.
No, Dai... no.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.323
No, don't send me
to a supervisor, Daisy.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.427
Daisy, Daisy...

15:58.460 --> 16:00.197
it's just you and me.

16:00.230 --> 16:02.301
Just you and me, Daisy,
fighting the good fight

16:02.334 --> 16:04.239
against a broken system
engineered

16:04.272 --> 16:06.243
to drive us both so crazy

16:06.276 --> 16:07.613
that we have to take days off

16:07.646 --> 16:10.518
for our mental health!

16:10.551 --> 16:13.056
-[beeping]
-[sighing]

16:13.089 --> 16:14.459
Daisy?

16:14.493 --> 16:16.096
Yes?

16:16.129 --> 16:18.100
The Tsuma.
It's made in America, right?

16:18.133 --> 16:19.469
Yes, it is.

16:19.503 --> 16:21.172
Where?

16:25.715 --> 16:27.752
[rolling thunder]

16:33.063 --> 16:35.334
[woman]
Yup. Great, wonderful. [laughs]

16:35.367 --> 16:36.737
All right, yes, okay. Yup.

16:36.770 --> 16:39.342
Oh, let me call you back.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.714
[woman clears throat]

16:41.747 --> 16:44.052
Hello. How are you?

16:44.085 --> 16:46.122
I've been better.

16:46.155 --> 16:48.126
[both laugh]

I'll just wait.

I'll make sure he gets it
