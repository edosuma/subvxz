Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

23:13.771 --> 23:15.739
God, the size of it is massive.

23:17.741 --> 23:20.468
It has genes that have been
extinct since the Cretaceous,

23:20.606 --> 23:22.642
and swarms of them
are decimating crops

23:22.780 --> 23:24.230

23:24.368 --> 23:26.370

23:27.371 --> 23:28.924

by the end of the summer.

23:31.133 --> 23:32.721

23:32.859 --> 23:35.517
there will be no grain
to feed chickens, cattle.

23:35.655 --> 23:37.830

would collapse.

23:37.968 --> 23:42.110

but why would anyone do that?

the world's food supply.

24:14.694 --> 24:17.145

You know, when we made Blue,
we used monitor lizard DNA

1:06:18.975 --> 1:06:21.563
to fill in the gaps
in her genome.

1:06:21.701 --> 1:06:24.463
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate,

1:06:24.601 --> 1:06:28.467
so Beta and Blue
are genetically identical,

1:06:28.605 --> 1:06:30.365
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

1:06:30.503 --> 1:06:32.229
Charlotte.

1:06:34.749 --> 1:06:36.440
What do you know
about Charlotte?

1:06:36.578 --> 1:06:38.166
She died.

1:06:39.202 --> 1:06:40.582
A long time ago.

1:06:41.652 --> 1:06:43.447
It broke my grandpa's heart.

1:06:45.242 --> 1:06:46.795
So he made me.

1:06:48.418 --> 1:06:50.523
No, Maisie, actually, he didn't.

1:06:53.043 --> 1:06:55.114
Charlotte made you.

1:06:57.979 --> 1:07:00.706
I'm so excited for everyone to
see what we've been doing here.

1:07:00.844 --> 1:07:03.950
There's new technology
being made, new science,

1:07:04.089 --> 1:07:05.849
like, every day almost.

1:07:05.987 --> 1:07:07.471
And it's great to be...

1:07:07.609 --> 1:07:09.128
it's great to be
in the center...

1:07:09.266 --> 1:07:10.854
center of that.

1:07:10.992 --> 1:07:15.203
- Charlotte lived
on Site B with all of us.

1:07:15.341 --> 1:07:17.550
Till the storm.

1:07:17.688 --> 1:07:19.035
She loved dinosaurs.

1:07:19.173 --> 1:07:20.450
HENRY
Charlotte, be careful.

1:07:20.588 --> 1:07:22.003
Yeah, I will.

1:07:22.141 --> 1:07:23.970
She grew up around scientists.

1:07:24.971 --> 1:07:27.146
Then, eventually...

1:07:28.182 --> 1:07:29.873
...she became one herself.

1:07:30.011 --> 1:07:31.978
A butterfly flew into
my office this morning.

1:07:32.117 --> 1:07:34.326
They say tiny things
have huge impacts,

1:07:34.464 --> 1:07:36.328
and I agree wholeheartedly.

1:07:36.466 --> 1:07:38.433
She was brilliant.

1:07:40.125 --> 1:07:41.850
In ways that I'll never be.

1:07:41.988 --> 1:07:43.473
In the metaphysics of identity,

1:07:43.611 --> 1:07:45.751
can a replica
truly be the original?

1:07:45.889 --> 1:07:49.479
And if it's possible,
what makes it so?

1:07:54.518 --> 1:07:56.348
I've lost my pen.

1:07:59.765 --> 1:08:01.007
Is that me?

1:08:01.146 --> 1:08:03.389
Yeah.

1:08:03.527 --> 1:08:05.184
Just like Blue,
Charlotte was able

1:08:05.322 --> 1:08:07.186
to have a child all by herself.

1:08:08.325 --> 1:08:11.949
She created you
with her own DNA.

1:08:12.950 --> 1:08:15.125
So I do have a mother.

1:08:15.263 --> 1:08:18.370
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

1:08:18.508 --> 1:08:21.338
He was protecting her and you.

1:08:22.374 --> 1:08:23.789
And we're the same?

1:08:25.722 --> 1:08:27.033
You were.

1:08:27.172 --> 1:08:29.174
When you were a baby,
Charlotte started

1:08:29.312 --> 1:08:31.176
to show symptoms
of a genetic disorder.

1:08:31.314 --> 1:08:33.902
That's how she died.

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:37.458
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

1:08:37.596 --> 1:08:39.356
Do I have it, too?

1:08:39.494 --> 1:08:40.702
No.

1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:43.084
She changed your DNA.

1:08:43.222 --> 1:08:45.880
She altered every cell
in your body

1:08:46.018 --> 1:08:48.262
to eradicate this disease.

1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:50.954
No one on earth has ever
known how to do that.

1:08:51.092 --> 1:08:53.232
She fixed me.

1:08:53.370 --> 1:08:56.062
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

1:08:58.030 --> 1:09:01.413
Your DNA could change the world.

1:09:01.551 --> 1:09:03.622
And I have to know
how she did it,

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:05.900
but I just can't
replicate her work.

1:09:06.038 --> 1:09:07.729
If I could just study you

1:09:07.867 --> 1:09:11.112
and Beta, whose DNA
was never changed, I could...

1:09:13.459 --> 1:09:16.290
...fix a terrible mistake
that I've made.

1:09:16.428 --> 1:09:18.257
