WEBVTT

00:00.215 --> 00:02.368
It seems our little secret's out.

00:05.335 --> 00:07.943
- They're opening up everywhere.
- All over the world.

00:08.063 --> 00:11.148
This is it. We're about to
make history.

00:11.268 --> 00:13.325
Stop him. Do whatever
you have to.

00:13.445 --> 00:17.617
See I know that you think you're doing the
right thing, but you couldn't be more wrong.

00:18.263 --> 00:20.894
New Dawn kills everything.

00:21.014 --> 00:23.693
There are dinosaurs roaming
the streets.

00:23.813 --> 00:26.756
- That's what the ARC's for.
- The ARC has failed.

00:28.071 --> 00:30.272
Yes. I'm in.

00:30.392 --> 00:32.281
- It's Connor.
- Get him down.

00:32.402 --> 00:37.019
Come on April. Don't give me an
excuse to fire.

00:43.164 --> 00:46.346
Philip. You've gotta listen to me.
I've seen this.

00:46.466 --> 00:49.025
You're gonna kill everything....
Philip no!

00:51.839 --> 00:54.184
Cheer up man. It's working.

00:57.309 --> 00:58.553
No!

03:18.215 --> 03:21.923
We have to go after Connor.
Philip at least let me go after him.

03:22.043 --> 03:25.248
No one is going after Connor
until this anomaly is stable.

03:25.368 --> 03:27.736
You can't control this you
have to listen to me.

03:27.856 --> 03:30.057
No. You listen to me.

03:30.177 --> 03:33.661
This machine is already generating more
power than the entire national grid

03:33.781 --> 03:35.360
and this is only the beginning.

03:35.719 --> 03:38.183
Did you ever even care about him?

03:38.901 --> 03:42.489
- That kid worshiped you.
- Of course I cared for him.

03:43.342 --> 03:46.691
And if he is dead it will be
your fault.

03:48.605 --> 03:52.313
Cause he wouldn't even have been up there
if you hadn't poisoned him against me.

03:53.142 --> 03:58.453
Look around you Matt. The world
didn't end. You were wrong.

03:59.075 --> 04:02.137
This machine is a force for good.

04:02.917 --> 04:06.434
My work. Connor's work.

04:07.654 --> 04:11.243
I know he would have been proud
of what he has achieved.

04:12.382 --> 04:17.310
- You were wrong. You.
- Get him out of here.

04:49.235 --> 04:51.819
Emily I <i>have</i> to go after Connor.
I have no choice.

04:51.939 --> 04:54.857
Abby. Listen to me. You can't go
through, you're not thinking straight.

04:54.977 --> 04:56.556
Hey! Hey!

04:58.102 --> 05:01.428
- I'm going. I'm gonna go.
- No. No. No. No.

05:02.026 --> 05:05.614
I gonna go. And I'm gonna bring him
back I promise. You're gonna stay here

05:05.734 --> 05:08.174
because I need both of you here.
Okay?

05:19.781 --> 05:21.312
Abby.

05:23.326 --> 05:25.168
Connor do you read me?

05:26.316 --> 05:28.206
Anyone do you read me?

05:35.863 --> 05:38.925
No. Not here.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.724
Connor!

05:59.523 --> 06:01.150
Connor.

06:06.977 --> 06:08.843
It's growing too quickly.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.585
It can't be right. Run those
tests again.

06:32.353 --> 06:35.296
It's all right. I expected this.

06:48.268 --> 06:49.943
Connor.

06:53.686 --> 06:55.600
Matt.

07:07.436 --> 07:08.622
Help me.

07:15.890 --> 07:17.742
On three we're gonna move, ok?

07:17.862 --> 07:19.400
- No.
- We're gonna do it man it's gonna be good.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.744
We're gonna be fine.

07:39.401 --> 07:41.971
It's Abby.
Where's Emily?

07:42.091 --> 07:43.713
Distracting the guards.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.313
It's coming again.

07:51.232 --> 07:52.667
Okay, follow me.

07:52.787 --> 07:54.409
Come on.
These winds are toxic.

07:59.342 --> 08:02.156
We'll be safe in here.
Help me.

08:03.948 --> 08:05.708
Connor get in.

08:08.101 --> 08:09.287
Abby. Go!

08:16.100 --> 08:17.344
You ok?

08:19.488 --> 08:21.076
Where are we?

08:22.454 --> 08:25.593
Okay. Here. Set him over here.
He needs water.

08:28.810 --> 08:32.427
You just keep breathing and that pain is
gonna pass all right? Just keep breathing.

08:37.243 --> 08:38.544
What is this place?

08:39.100 --> 08:40.822
Our only hope.

08:53.022 --> 08:56.773
- My throat is burning.
- Hello

09:01.187 --> 09:02.967
He needs water.

09:03.407 --> 09:04.402
Okay.

09:06.363 --> 09:08.105
How did you know this
place was here?

09:08.951 --> 09:11.151
Water. There must be water.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.562
This is my time.

09:14.558 --> 09:15.859
My guess later.

09:17.115 --> 09:18.666
Or close to it.

09:20.771 --> 09:22.455
You actually lived out there.

09:22.575 --> 09:24.503
Nothing can survive
out there Abby.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.104
Except those ugly freaks.

09:29.687 --> 09:30.778
Awh!!

09:32.750 --> 09:33.898
Oh, no.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.771
It's clean, it's clean.
Here.

09:46.113 --> 09:48.123
- Okay.
- Drink this.

09:50.668 --> 09:51.855
It's okay.

09:53.845 --> 09:56.467
- You okay?
- Storms are erratic and hard to predict.

09:56.587 --> 09:58.202
We're going to have to
time this carefully.

10:01.092 --> 10:02.681
You lived underground?

10:04.671 --> 10:06.834
Yeah. We moved from shelter
to shelter.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.161
Tried to avoid the storms.
Fought the predators.

10:09.927 --> 10:11.975
When I got to your time...

10:12.798 --> 10:14.711
I thought it was the "Garden
of Eden".

10:15.680 --> 10:17.288
Where's everyone now?

10:17.408 --> 10:20.197
Everyone is dead, Abby.

10:22.390 --> 10:23.711
Have a good look.

10:24.821 --> 10:26.907
This is what New Dawn did
to the earth.

10:27.615 --> 10:29.203
Turned it into Hell.

10:40.512 --> 10:42.540
What is wrong with you people?

10:42.660 --> 10:44.856
Can't you see that I'm actually
quite busy here?

10:44.976 --> 10:46.636
They might be dead now
because of you.

10:46.756 --> 10:48.205
Take her away.

10:55.264 --> 10:58.977
You have to stop Burton.
Listen to me.

10:59.097 --> 11:00.623
Let me out of here.

11:08.206 --> 11:11.383
Malfunction. Emergency.

11:15.206 --> 11:17.421
Place the magnetic field brackets.

11:17.541 --> 11:20.560
What are you doing.
Where're you going! I need you!

11:24.977 --> 11:27.503
Primary reactor off line.

11:34.263 --> 11:38.186
Emergency. Emergency. Emergency.

11:38.306 --> 11:41.593
Emergency. Emergency. Emergency.

11:50.033 --> 11:52.004
Helen won...

11:56.585 --> 11:58.135
and I helped.

12:00.911 --> 12:03.265
All I ever wanted to
do was to prove...

12:04.061 --> 12:06.454
to Cutter that he was
right to trust me.

12:08.935 --> 12:12.610
And I ended up just betraying everything
that he even stood for.

12:54.519 --> 12:55.878
It's okay.

13:41.266 --> 13:44.329
You okay? What happened?

13:45.565 --> 13:47.555
Can Philip not afford to
pay the electricity bill?

13:47.675 --> 13:51.345
Some kind of electrical surge. Everything
went dead. We're on emergency power.

13:51.465 --> 13:55.532
The system is fried. The dectors offline,
and I can't get through to anyone on coms.

13:55.652 --> 13:57.522
Okay, we'll just get some to fix it.

13:57.642 --> 13:59.460
Everyone is out in the field.

13:59.580 --> 14:02.389
I don't think the power outage is
restricted to the ARC.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.877
Philip's infernal machine.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.422
Now I've seen it all. Mobile phone
reception when you really need it.

14:19.934 --> 14:21.274
It's Becker.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.552
Electricity's out all
across the city.

14:23.672 --> 14:28.214
It's as if someone set off a huge
electromagnetic weapon. What's Matt say?

14:28.334 --> 14:31.411
We've lost touch with him. Get to
New Dawn and find out what's going on.

14:32.486 --> 14:35.491
Try that.
We're on our way.

14:37.539 --> 14:38.974
Good man.

14:39.453 --> 14:40.792
Good man.

14:49.123 --> 14:53.161
Every second we stay here New Dawn gets
stronger. We need to go. We need to go now.

14:54.180 --> 14:58.065
You two go then. I'll catch up
when I feel a bit better.

14:59.902 --> 15:02.295
Don't even think about giving
up on me.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.831
I'll slow you down.

15:06.654 --> 15:07.745
Never.

15:08.855 --> 15:11.649
Whatever we do, we do together.
Thanks the deal.

15:12.013 --> 15:14.827
I need you to stop that machine.
I can't do it.

15:15.258 --> 15:17.498
Come on. Nothings finished yet.

15:17.618 --> 15:21.804
Connor. Forget about Philip
and the machine,

15:24.725 --> 15:26.218
You have to go back.

15:31.638 --> 15:35.045
- Why?
- Because...

15:50.200 --> 15:52.381
- Really?
- Yes.

16:00.335 --> 16:03.110
Stop messing around
and help us.

16:08.369 --> 16:09.384
Come on.

16:09.805 --> 16:11.279
The wind's dying down.

16:11.399 --> 16:12.542
Whew.

16:13.128 --> 16:14.716
We doing this or what, then?

16:26.036 --> 16:27.490
It's clear. Hurry.

17:21.698 --> 17:22.789
Connor.

17:26.425 --> 17:29.449
It's expanding too quickly.
It's not safe inside. Come on.

17:32.786 --> 17:37.035
You will find a way.
Our hopes rest on you.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.307
The future is in your hands,

17:40.690 --> 17:42.547
and there's no doubt you
will do it.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.612
The future is in your hands.

17:58.618 --> 17:59.824
It's him.

18:00.130 --> 18:01.221
Philip.

18:06.817 --> 18:09.611
- Connor. You're alive.
- I need you to help us.

18:09.731 --> 18:13.611
I know this is what Helen wanted.
I just don't understand why.

18:13.905 --> 18:15.991
The anomaly's grown so powerful.

18:16.111 --> 18:17.962
Use the code so we can
shut down the system.

18:18.082 --> 18:20.202
- It's too late. It's-
- Stop lying to me Philip.

18:20.322 --> 18:22.288
Otherwise I'm gonna drag you through
that anomaly myself

18:22.408 --> 18:23.513
and I'll show you what
you've done.

18:24.539 --> 18:26.970
Listen to me. I know your
intentions were good,

18:27.090 --> 18:28.960
and I know you were trying
to help us...

18:29.080 --> 18:31.938
This is what Helen exploited.
It's what she always exploited,

18:32.589 --> 18:35.804
humanity. Your humanity.

18:35.924 --> 18:38.541
She didn't exploite my humanity.
I mean...

18:39.021 --> 18:40.954
she exploited my ego.

18:41.406 --> 18:43.837
Give us the codes.
We can still fix this.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.324
It's no use. The EM surge
would have fired the data.

18:46.444 --> 18:48.219
We can't just quit the program.

18:52.237 --> 18:53.519
Unless...

18:57.691 --> 18:59.089
There is a way.

18:59.209 --> 19:03.926
There is a possibility. Connor I need you
to crash the computer in the turbine room.

19:04.046 --> 19:06.874
- Do it.
- Then find Emily. I'm going with Philip.

19:06.994 --> 19:07.792
Come on.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.152
Any news?

19:25.951 --> 19:27.368
No.

19:35.019 --> 19:36.512
What if they failed?

19:37.354 --> 19:40.454
This is the beginning of the end.
Just like Matt said.

19:41.894 --> 19:43.177
What if they're all dead?

19:43.297 --> 19:45.933
They're not dead Jess, and
it's not the end of the world.

19:46.053 --> 19:48.708
If it was...
someone would have sent us a memo.

19:50.901 --> 19:53.332
You know what my father used
to say when things got rough?

19:56.241 --> 19:58.136
Where's that ruddy whiskey?

20:00.941 --> 20:02.415
Oh no.

20:02.931 --> 20:05.304
Don't tell me you're teetotal.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.143
There's...

20:13.731 --> 20:14.669
There's...

20:37.248 --> 20:38.262
Don't...

20:40.521 --> 20:42.569
don't make a sound.

20:46.722 --> 20:48.502
Okay, how do we do this?

20:48.622 --> 20:52.462
I can shut this machine down but when I do
there won't be much left of this building.

20:52.582 --> 20:54.103
You need to leave Matt.

20:54.223 --> 20:55.754
Can't we shut it down
and then make a run for it?

20:55.874 --> 20:57.330
As soon as I take the
last system offline,

20:57.450 --> 21:01.003
it will be like snagging the brakes on an
aircraft traveling 500 miles an hour.

21:02.785 --> 21:05.140
Everything in here will
be vaporized,

21:08.358 --> 21:09.629
including you Philip.

21:11.943 --> 21:12.963
Matt.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.431
I'm the bad guy.

21:41.463 --> 21:43.689
We gotta get down and
override it.

21:43.809 --> 21:45.321
I don't- I don't
Just do it Abby.

21:49.854 --> 21:51.301
Shutting it down now.

21:51.421 --> 21:52.339
Then what?

21:54.083 --> 21:55.826
We need to get out of here.

21:59.238 --> 21:59.934
Where...

22:00.795 --> 22:01.926
Where's Philip.

22:06.514 --> 22:07.886
He's not gonna make it.

22:09.296 --> 22:10.798
He want's to do the right thing.

22:12.022 --> 22:13.710
No. No, no, no we can...

22:14.511 --> 22:16.644
He's locked himself in,
there's nothing we can do.

22:19.890 --> 22:21.763
- We can't just let him...
- Connor. Connor.

22:22.173 --> 22:23.564
If this is what he wants.

22:25.549 --> 22:28.052
Come on, we're leaving.
We have to get out of here.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.851
- Come on.
- Come on.

22:33.757 --> 22:36.242
Get clear of the building.
I'll find Emily.

22:57.666 --> 22:59.039
EMILY!!

23:03.991 --> 23:04.788
Emily.

23:08.223 --> 23:09.410
Emily.

23:17.953 --> 23:19.177
Emily.

23:20.624 --> 23:21.533
Matt.

23:25.391 --> 23:26.893
What took you so long?

24:14.625 --> 24:18.631
Self destruction sequence initiated.

24:27.298 --> 24:32.361
Unintelligable computer
announcements contine)

24:59.370 --> 25:02.282
The anomaly's too powerful, it
doesn't need the machine anymore.

25:05.625 --> 25:07.610
There's no way we
can stop it now.

25:47.669 --> 25:51.842
Your anomaly, the one in your lab.
It was the prototype for this one, right?

25:51.962 --> 25:54.700
- Yeah.
- So essentially it's the same anomaly.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.853
It must have reopened which is how
the predators got into the ARC.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.061
There's a way to destablize
the anomaly,

26:00.181 --> 26:02.344
by merging the prototype
with this one.

26:09.832 --> 26:11.297
Where is everything.

26:13.115 --> 26:16.880
All the teams are out in the field but
I thought there'd be more than this left.

26:36.430 --> 26:37.635
No power.

26:39.313 --> 26:40.593
Power packs.

28:43.778 --> 28:46.374
Jess. You're all right now,
do you hear.

28:50.770 --> 28:52.996
Abby, keep a lookout.

28:54.183 --> 28:55.203
Okay.

28:55.504 --> 28:58.119
Let's get a drip in and seal
him in the medical bay.

28:58.239 --> 29:00.641
That's all we can do for now,
right? Jess.

29:01.569 --> 29:03.201
Jess how many were there.

29:03.321 --> 29:07.042
Um... four or-or five,
maybe more.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.739
Becker, check the corridor.

29:11.521 --> 29:12.875
James?

29:12.995 --> 29:15.851
Internal video system's down,
everything is.

29:18.355 --> 29:19.282
Connor.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.917
I need to get to my lab.
I <i>need</i> to get to that anomaly.

29:23.037 --> 29:25.219
Okay James. Come on.

29:27.241 --> 29:29.448
I got him.

29:31.183 --> 29:32.778
All right, let's go, one,
two, three.

29:32.898 --> 29:35.282
Take a big breath.
Just breathe.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.270
Look after Jess.

29:45.908 --> 29:48.060
We're all gonna die aren't we.

29:48.180 --> 29:51.992
- We're gonna die.
- Course not.

29:54.256 --> 29:58.225
Jess. Have you got a
laptop here?

29:58.345 --> 30:00.803
Yeah. Yeah.

30:01.288 --> 30:04.886
Good. Don't worry I've
got an idea.

30:05.628 --> 30:07.445
It's gonna be okay.

30:09.244 --> 30:10.469
Listen.

30:11.597 --> 30:16.141
We have beaten these creatures before.
We'll beat them again.

30:24.570 --> 30:25.943
Will it hold?

30:26.063 --> 30:27.983
Yeah. Yeah he'll be safe for now.

30:28.103 --> 30:31.526
Okay. You sweep through this way
and we'll meet you at Connor's lab.

30:45.910 --> 30:47.950
Your secret weapon is sound.

30:48.070 --> 30:52.068
Not exactly but the disrupter sound
should seriously mess them up.

30:52.188 --> 30:56.177
They work on sonar. It means
they pick up infrasound.

30:56.297 --> 30:58.829
Low pitched noises way
beyond our hearing.

30:58.949 --> 31:01.351
I'm going to overload their
nasty little brains.

31:01.471 --> 31:02.837
Will it be enough to kill them?

31:02.957 --> 31:04.970
No but it will-should slow them
down enough for us to shoot them.

31:06.862 --> 31:08.865
Just access this file.

31:39.521 --> 31:41.505
Why did it go?

31:46.457 --> 31:47.533
Wait here.

32:40.070 --> 32:41.739
That's the first one I've
managed to hit.

32:42.277 --> 32:43.427
Thank you.

33:21.980 --> 33:23.334
Nice plan, Abby.

33:36.371 --> 33:37.540
All right. It's safe.

33:38.485 --> 33:41.935
Okay Matt. When I-when I tell you to close
it do it in one fluid movement, all right?

33:42.770 --> 33:44.012
Good luck.

33:45.956 --> 33:46.995
Cheers.

33:56.205 --> 33:57.169
Go.

33:59.302 --> 34:00.248
That's good.

34:02.195 --> 34:03.141
Locked.

34:09.918 --> 34:15.260
- Okay, ready?
- One, two, three.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.981
Easy. Easy.

34:23.284 --> 34:26.289
If we damage the suncage in any
way and we might lose the anomaly.

34:27.203 --> 34:30.152
- Okay, got it.
- Careful.

34:35.585 --> 34:39.072
Look no offense, but do you
really think this is gonna work?

34:39.193 --> 34:43.636
Well... we've three options

34:44.143 --> 34:46.869
One we merge this
with Philip's anomaly.

34:47.295 --> 34:50.801
It makes the big one unstable,
it closes and the plans worked.

34:50.920 --> 34:54.309
Two. Nothing happens and it
doesn't change a thing right?

34:54.429 --> 34:57.165
- Right.
- So far I prefer option 1.

34:57.611 --> 34:59.447
What's option 3?

34:59.896 --> 35:03.661
It makes the big one even more
powerful and it accelerates the whole

35:03.781 --> 35:06.832
apocalyptic end of the world
type thing.

35:08.093 --> 35:09.596
Basically not good.

35:11.937 --> 35:13.291
Well let's find out.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.647
- Ready?
- Yeah.

35:24.650 --> 35:25.800
We're good.

35:36.555 --> 35:38.503
- I'm gonna go and rig the car.
- Okay.

35:40.302 --> 35:41.118
Okay.

35:41.238 --> 35:45.130
- You're gonna drive it yourself.
- It's the only chance we have.

35:51.197 --> 35:52.662
You know what I have to do?

35:54.276 --> 35:55.537
It's all about this.

35:55.657 --> 35:59.135
If you fail...
you die.

36:01.024 --> 36:05.160
If you succeed, if you
change the future

36:07.275 --> 36:09.148
You might never even
have existed.

36:11.474 --> 36:12.605
You could just...

36:16.852 --> 36:18.262
- disappear.
- Hey.

36:34.225 --> 36:35.727
- Ready?
- Ready.

36:35.847 --> 36:37.638
Just need to secure the
steering wheel.

36:37.758 --> 36:39.659
I'll see about that.

36:41.275 --> 36:44.131
- Stop it.
- No.

36:44.251 --> 36:46.283
- Matt no.
- Matt!

38:27.476 --> 38:28.347
Matt.

38:47.498 --> 38:48.444
Matt!

38:53.361 --> 38:54.586
Wai-ait.

38:54.706 --> 38:55.977
How did you survive?

38:56.097 --> 38:57.349
I've no idea.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.667
- Good.
- Well I sure can see it.

39:10.420 --> 39:11.792
Just think we did it.

39:13.968 --> 39:15.860
Just think we changed the future.

39:17.715 --> 39:18.698
Yeah.

39:20.312 --> 39:21.461
Think so.

39:25.670 --> 39:26.598
Matt.

39:27.414 --> 39:29.027
What about my truck.

39:30.734 --> 39:31.791
No.

39:33.712 --> 39:36.994
Oh, well, I guess we'll just
walk back to the ARC.

39:37.114 --> 39:37.903
Yeah.

39:54.592 --> 39:57.207
- How's Lester?
- He's gonna be ok.

39:57.327 --> 39:59.266
He's already threatening to
sack the medics.

40:02.069 --> 40:05.185
- Abby. Could I just have a word?
- Yeah.

40:05.305 --> 40:08.393
Um... I wanted to...

40:09.922 --> 40:11.109
you know the...

40:13.465 --> 40:15.115
whispered thing.

40:16.284 --> 40:17.285
Whisper?

40:18.586 --> 40:20.367
Well yeah... you...

40:20.923 --> 40:25.170
You said that when we were back
you know all this-all this  was over then

40:25.290 --> 40:28.047
you said you were gonna...
you know you sai...

40:29.327 --> 40:30.384
You said you'd...

40:32.687 --> 40:35.394
Great. You don't remember.

40:37.694 --> 40:38.603
Connor

40:39.765 --> 40:40.822
Yep.

40:41.156 --> 40:42.547
Temple

40:49.937 --> 40:51.514
will you marry me?

41:00.037 --> 41:02.263
- I'll have to think about it. Yes.
- Forget about it.

41:04.802 --> 41:06.211
So yes.

41:12.390 --> 41:14.987
Oh, please, for goodness sake

41:15.107 --> 41:17.884
stop fussing. I'm perfectly
capable of walking by myself.

41:18.004 --> 41:20.184
Here we are. How are you
feeling Lester?

41:20.722 --> 41:23.133
What an idiotic question.
How do you think I'm feeling?

41:26.719 --> 41:28.184
It's so good to see you.

41:28.304 --> 41:31.248
- I take it this means we won then?
- Here we go.

41:35.717 --> 41:36.534
You did it.

41:38.801 --> 41:40.823
Guess this means we're
stuck with you now.

41:41.583 --> 41:42.752
I guess it does.

41:42.872 --> 41:45.756
I think we should keep the uh... whole
man from the future thing

41:45.876 --> 41:47.555
just between ourselves.
Don't you?

41:48.124 --> 41:50.256
Minister's confused enough
as it is.

41:51.091 --> 41:54.207
Well this is turning into a
surprisingly good day.

41:54.578 --> 41:58.658
With us...
Saving the world and...

42:00.421 --> 42:02.703
Well I suppose that's the end
of the anomalies.

42:02.823 --> 42:07.061
It is possible Philip's machine might
have closed the anomalies forever.

42:07.379 --> 42:10.402
That'd be really wierd,
being normal again.

42:18.449 --> 42:23.364
Ach... only two people have got that number,
one's the minister the others my wife.

42:23.642 --> 42:26.164
Either way I think I'm
in for an earful.

42:30.729 --> 42:31.786
James Lester.

42:36.571 --> 42:37.702
Understood.

42:40.229 --> 42:42.214
So much for being normal Connor.

42:42.826 --> 42:45.960
Train just left Kings Cross.
Disappeared into thin air.

42:47.592 --> 42:49.317
So does that sound familar
to anyone?

42:50.285 --> 42:52.863
Anomalies. Chop chop.

42:53.308 --> 42:54.198
Yep.

42:55.107 --> 42:59.317
Everyone grab a black box. I'll
get the system up and running.

43:03.163 --> 43:04.257
Let's go.

43:19.365 --> 43:21.461
Well Parker, don't just stand there.

43:21.581 --> 43:23.334
Get back to work.

43:37.982 --> 43:39.466
Emily?

43:39.586 --> 43:42.767
Coms are still down.
Better get my phone.

43:57.656 --> 43:58.917
Hello?

44:28.280 --> 44:29.671
Go back.

44:31.266 --> 44:34.215
- You have to go back.
- Matt.

44:38.138 --> 44:40.160
What's wrong?

44:41.922 --> 44:43.183
Nothing.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.189
I'm fine.

44:47.946 --> 44:49.652
We're ready to go.
