11:58.618 --> 12:01.121
SOUNDS LIKE A WILD
SLUMBER PARTY.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.489
IT WAS.

12:02.555 --> 12:06.059
WE WERE UP UNTIL
ABOUT A QUARTER TO 10:00.

12:11.298 --> 12:15.335

RACHEL, RACHEL.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.771
ARE YOU GOING TO BE
DOING THIS A LOT?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.706
OH, YEAH.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.741
YOU KNOW, IT'S
ALL COMING BACK.

12:21.809 --> 12:25.312
THEY USED TO
CALL ME HOT LIPS.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.481
RACHEL, THAT WAS BEFORE
YOU GOT THE SAXOPHONE.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.519
OH, YEAH.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.823
WELL, GOODWILL JUST TOOK
ALL THE JUNK
THAT DIDN'T SELL.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.158
OF COURSE,
I HAD TO TIP HIM 5 BUCKS

12:38.225 --> 12:41.094
TO TAKE
THE BOWLING BALL LAMP.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.696
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID WE MAKE?

12:43.763 --> 12:47.467
350 BIG ONES.

12:48.668 --> 12:51.805
WE MADE $350,000?

12:55.809 --> 12:58.411
NO, NIMROD.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.981
$350.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.615
I SOLD
SOME OF GRANDMA'S NAPKINS

13:02.682 --> 13:04.451
AND A FEW
OF HER OTHER THINGS.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.553
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.589
NO ONE ELSE'S

13:13.026 --> 13:15.162
WHAT PUT ME
OVER THE TOP

13:15.228 --> 13:18.698
WAS THE 300 BUCKS I GOT
FOR GRANDMA'S OLD QUILT.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.400
WHAT? SAY THAT AGAIN.

13:20.467 --> 13:24.938
LAURA, YOU DIDN'T SELL
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S QUILT?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.907
GRANDMA, I KNOW
WHAT YOU TOLD ME,

13:26.974 --> 13:28.141
BUT I MADE ENOUGH MONEY

13:28.208 --> 13:30.177
TO BUY A VCR
AND A NEW QUILT.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.013
LIKE YOU SAID,
OUT WITH THE OLD,
IN WITH THE NEW.

13:33.080 --> 13:37.317
THAT QUILT HAS BEEN
IN OUR FAMILY
FOR 200 YEARS.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.921
THE PATCHES MAKE UP
OUR FAMILY HISTORY.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.858
IT'S THE ONLY
RECORD WE HAVE.

13:44.925 --> 13:48.361
THAT QUILT IS PRICELESS.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.834
EXCUSE ME.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.524
HOW YOU DOING, MOM?

OHH...

14:24.364 --> 14:28.268
WELL, SHE'S DOING A LOT BETTER
THAN SHE WAS YESTERDAY.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.703
THAT QUILT SURE
MEANT A LOT TO HER.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.172
HOW'S LAURA DOING?

14:32.239 --> 14:35.242
SHE'S OUT PUTTING
FLYERS ALL OVER
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.912
SHE'S GOT IT IN HER MIND
SHE'S GOING TO FIND THAT QUILT.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.982
YOU KNOW, WE
NEED TO CHEER UP
AROUND HERE.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.383
HOW ABOUT
SOME MUSIC?

14:43.450 --> 14:45.352

I DON'T KNOW.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.527
COME ON, RICHIE.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.165
I'VE GOT A WHOLE
NEW BOX OF REEDS
UPSTAIRS.

15:02.169 --> 15:05.205
OH, NO, SHE DOESN'T.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.377
I OWE YOU BIG,
HARRIETTE.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.050
HI, HONEY.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.186
ANY LUCK
TRACKING DOWN
THAT QUILT?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.820
NO.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.490
I PUT UP FLYERS.
I WENT TO
EVERY STORE.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.425
I KNOCKED ON DOORS.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.493
NOTHING.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.229
LAURA, YOU'RE DOING
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.931
I REALLY LET
THE FAMILY DOWN,
DIDN'T I?

15:31.999 --> 15:34.101
SWEETHEART...

15:34.167 --> 15:35.902
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
SOLD THE QUILT.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.537
THAT'S FOR SURE.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.473
BUT THIS IS A MISTAKE
YOU'LL HAVE TO LIVE WITH

15:40.540 --> 15:42.075
AND LEARN FROM.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.944
POOR GRANDMA HAS TO
LIVE WITH IT, TOO.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.779
SHE TOLD ME
NOT TO FEEL BAD,

15:46.846 --> 15:48.815
BUT I KNOW
I REALLY HURT HER.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.785
I'LL FIND THAT QUILT
IF IT TAKES ME
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.387
LAURA, I'M A COP.

15:54.454 --> 15:58.258
IF YOU DON'T FIND A GOOD LEAD
WITHIN AT LEAST 24 HOURS,

15:58.325 --> 16:00.627
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO SOLVE THE CASE.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.356
WELL, LOOK AT THIS ONE.
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.291
IT'S A PICTURE
OF A GORGEOUS GIRL

16:31.358 --> 16:32.959
LEAVING THE GARAGE SALE
WITH NOTHING.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.395
I CALL IT,
"GIRL WITH NOTHING."

16:37.797 --> 16:40.133

COULD TAKE BETTER
PICTURES.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.336
LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S A SHOT
OF OUR MAILBOX.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.439
I WAS AIMING FOR THAT LADY
GETTING INTO HER CAR.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.909
BUT THE MAILBOX
JUST GOT IN MY WAY.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.578
WAIT A MINUTE!
THAT'S HER!

OH.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.977

FORGIVE HER.

A LITTLE UPSET.

TO SELL THE QUILT.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.617
SO WE'LL
JUST GIVE YOU
YOUR MONEY BACK,

18:04.684 --> 18:07.487

WE'LL FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.291
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.160
MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME
NOT TO SELL IT,

18:47.227 --> 18:50.497
BUT I DIDN'T LISTEN.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.260
WELL, YES.
EVERYBODY HAS.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.161

IF YOU SOLD
SOMETHING

19:23.330 --> 19:25.665
OF YOUR FAMILY'S
