00:24.564 --> 00:27.043
It's time.

00:27.044 --> 00:30.203
You have to decide.

00:30.204 --> 00:33.203
It's the only way.

00:33.204 --> 00:37.204
Only you can give the order.

00:59.204 --> 01:03.204
'Dude, make it quick.'

01:31.263 --> 01:33.462
Back again, are we?

01:33.463 --> 01:35.782
Didn't expect to see you so soon.

01:35.783 --> 01:39.783
Don't take it personally, but it's
never good to have the police around.

01:40.063 --> 01:42.342
After Grant Leetham, are we?

01:42.343 --> 01:46.343
Um, I just spoke to his mother -
apparently he's missing.

01:46.463 --> 01:49.022
There's nothing new there.

01:49.023 --> 01:52.022
Here.

01:52.023 --> 01:54.263
How many people
are in this building?

01:54.264 --> 01:57.022
What, now? Not many, school's over.

01:57.023 --> 02:00.702
Em, four in Geology Club,
Janey's got this detention

02:00.703 --> 02:04.703
and I've got
a young lad in the gym...

02:05.983 --> 02:08.463
What was that?!

04:14.858 --> 04:18.576
Your lives as you knew them are
over. What the next 48 hours
are about

04:18.577 --> 04:21.538
is abandoning everything you knew
or thought you could rely on,

04:21.539 --> 04:24.377
and adjusting to the new reality.

04:24.378 --> 04:27.497
So are the things in Utopia real?

04:27.498 --> 04:28.957
BSE was theirs.

04:28.982 --> 04:30.140
What's that? Comic.

04:30.141 --> 04:32.980
Are you going to show me
or are you going to be a twat?

04:32.981 --> 04:34.262
Keep it under your bed.

04:34.263 --> 04:38.061
'That's 11 now dead on the Shetland
Island of Fetlar.'

04:38.062 --> 04:40.702
We need a sample of the vaccine.
There's a man in Sheffield,

04:40.703 --> 04:44.021
a scientist called Donaldson,
get it to him.

04:44.022 --> 04:48.022
It's me. The manuscript exists.
The boy knows where it is.

04:48.023 --> 04:51.701
There's a woman,
works in secret, trusts no-one.

04:51.702 --> 04:53.141
What's her name?

04:53.142 --> 04:57.142
Her name's... Milner.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.462
Right, shall we wait for Jessica?

05:02.463 --> 05:04.501
What for? I can break in.

05:04.502 --> 05:06.741
Yeah, I can break in as well.

05:06.742 --> 05:09.862
Jesus Christ! Am I the only one
who can't break into houses?!

05:09.863 --> 05:13.862
We'll teach you if you want.

05:19.222 --> 05:22.261
Ooh, got some bruising here.

05:22.262 --> 05:26.262
You'll have to keep
your weight off it.

05:27.942 --> 05:31.942
Thanks, Becky, for finding me.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.941
You got a boyfriend?

05:37.062 --> 05:40.261
No! I haven't got a boyfriend.

05:40.262 --> 05:44.262
You're well fit. I knew you would
be. I can tell from what you typed.

05:45.022 --> 05:48.502
From what you typed, I thought
you were 24 and drove a Porsche.

05:48.503 --> 05:52.021
I will drive a Porsche when I'm 24.

05:52.022 --> 05:56.022
I've got a girlfriend, though. Her
name's Alice. I met her yesterday.

05:58.062 --> 06:00.981
Have you got the manuscript?

06:00.982 --> 06:04.982
Grant, listen to me, it's very
important. I need... We need...

06:05.462 --> 06:09.462
Ow! I'm sorry.

06:11.742 --> 06:15.742
I left it somewhere. Right.

06:16.902 --> 06:20.902
When you're ready, you need
to come and tell me, OK?

06:22.982 --> 06:25.421
What's it like?

06:25.422 --> 06:27.941
It's... not what I thought.

06:27.942 --> 06:31.942
I mean, I thought part two,
it'd be like a new story.

06:32.942 --> 06:36.942
But it ain't. It's the same, just...
just different.

06:37.342 --> 06:39.981
Like the scientist is called Carvel.

06:39.982 --> 06:43.982
And the... And the rabbit,
has he got a name, Grant?

06:44.462 --> 06:48.462
I think it began with an L.

06:53.262 --> 06:55.860
So he has had it, then?
I mean, he can tell us where it is?

06:55.861 --> 06:58.780
He's an 11-year-old boy
who's seen someone murdered.

06:58.781 --> 07:01.702
Right? He's been alone for days,
he's not ready to trust anyone.

07:01.703 --> 07:04.181
So do we give it to Jessica then?

07:04.182 --> 07:06.861
No way! God knows what she's up to.

07:06.862 --> 07:10.140
We take it to this woman,
to Milner. I mean she's MI5.

07:10.141 --> 07:13.062
We take it to her, we hand it over,
we just get the fuck out of this.

07:13.063 --> 07:17.062
Fuck!

07:23.062 --> 07:24.621
Does he have it? No.

07:24.622 --> 07:26.061
The manuscript?

07:26.062 --> 07:29.100
Look, he's left it somewhere,
he hasn't said where.

07:29.101 --> 07:30.060
Did you search him?

07:30.061 --> 07:31.380
We are not searching him!

07:31.381 --> 07:32.782
You want to search this, darlin?

07:32.783 --> 07:35.341
Oi, Grant, stop that!

07:35.342 --> 07:39.342
You're just going
to have to go through me.

07:39.822 --> 07:42.421
And she thinks that'll be difficult.

07:42.422 --> 07:43.661
Sit down, Becky.

07:43.662 --> 07:46.902
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
- And why are you so enthralled to...

07:46.903 --> 07:49.661
Is that Grant? What?

07:49.662 --> 07:52.060
'This is the image of the boy
believed is responsible...'

07:52.061 --> 07:53.180
Why has it got my picture?

07:53.181 --> 07:56.780
'..for the deaths of
eight children and two teachers
at Bainstow Secondary school,

07:56.781 --> 07:59.940
in what police have described
as scenes of unparalleled horror.

07:59.941 --> 08:02.220
'The Prime Minister is expected
to make a statement

08:02.221 --> 08:04.742
'within the next 20 minutes.
But we can confirm...'

08:04.743 --> 08:06.781
That's not me.

08:06.782 --> 08:09.780
'..the fingerprints on the gun
are those of Grant Leetham,

08:09.781 --> 08:12.942
'a pupil at the school, and the boy
identified...' That is not me!

08:12.943 --> 08:16.942
'The Leetham family...'

08:46.342 --> 08:49.260
'This is the image of the boy
police believe is responsible

08:49.261 --> 08:52.502
'for the deaths of eight children
and two teachers...'

08:52.503 --> 08:55.181
How is he?

08:55.182 --> 08:59.182
He's pretending he's OK. He's...
terrified of what his mum thinks.

09:00.262 --> 09:04.061
Christ. How could they do that?

09:04.062 --> 09:08.021
They faked the CCTV
and the fingerprints.

09:08.022 --> 09:10.980
It don't need to stand up in court,
they just want to get hold of him.

09:10.981 --> 09:14.222
No, I mean how can they actually
do it, how can someone...?

09:14.223 --> 09:18.222
It's a handful of kids. So what?

09:18.822 --> 09:21.820
They've just made Grant the most
famous child in this country.

09:21.821 --> 09:24.620
The moment he's picked up,
they have him.

09:24.621 --> 09:27.582
And all it cost them
was a handful of lives.

09:27.583 --> 09:31.541
Don't you get it yet?
That is nothing to them.

09:31.542 --> 09:35.542
Death is part of it. Get used to it.

09:49.102 --> 09:51.781
Look, Becky, I... Wait, no!

09:51.782 --> 09:53.222
No. It's not a good idea.

09:53.223 --> 09:54.701
Why?

09:54.702 --> 09:58.702
Won't your girlfriend allow it?
Is it against orders?

10:41.062 --> 10:45.062
My Dad wrote Utopia.

10:45.502 --> 10:49.502
I never knew him. Not really.

10:53.622 --> 10:57.541
I grew up on the run.

10:57.542 --> 11:01.542
I learned not to trust people,
because you know what?

11:04.062 --> 11:08.062
People always let you down.

11:11.822 --> 11:15.822
And they want to sugar-coat it.
Treat you like a kid.

11:16.582 --> 11:19.141
That's fine for them.

11:19.142 --> 11:22.261
They've been kids.

11:22.262 --> 11:26.262
Some of us
don't get to have childhoods.

11:27.982 --> 11:31.741
Becky and Ian are great.

11:31.742 --> 11:35.742
But they're not like us.

11:42.022 --> 11:46.022
I want you
to show me the manuscript.

11:46.342 --> 11:50.342
I won't force you. It's your choice.

11:51.742 --> 11:54.741
But I want you to come with me.

11:54.742 --> 11:58.742
I'll keep you safe. You know I can.

12:00.022 --> 12:03.061
There's no place for me here.

12:03.062 --> 12:05.281
Not now, or ever.

12:12.959 --> 12:16.959
We always said this was Bhopal
and this was Lake Nyos.

12:18.359 --> 12:21.378
10,000 lives.

12:21.397 --> 12:25.036
Don't feel good being right.

12:25.037 --> 12:28.836
Where's Grant?

12:37.237 --> 12:41.237
You like some shit music.

12:42.997 --> 12:46.997
Is this shit?

12:50.708 --> 12:52.386
So your dad was Mark Dane?

12:52.387 --> 12:54.068
His real name was Philip Carvel.

12:54.069 --> 12:58.068
What, and you didn't know him?

12:58.708 --> 13:02.067
They got me out
when I was about four.

13:02.068 --> 13:04.186
I was given to a man
called Christos.

13:04.187 --> 13:08.188
He looked after me, but he was
more like a guard than a dad.

13:08.748 --> 13:12.027
He did his best.

13:12.028 --> 13:14.547
He taught me how to steal.

13:14.548 --> 13:18.187
How to fight.
How to survive, really.

13:18.188 --> 13:22.188
I was a total bitch to him,
but he never got angry.

13:23.828 --> 13:25.907
He was amazing.

13:25.908 --> 13:29.067
What happened to him?

13:29.068 --> 13:32.066
We were hiding in an old factory
and suddenly they turned up.

13:32.067 --> 13:33.868
He hid me and ran out at them.

13:33.869 --> 13:37.787
They caught him,
tortured him, killed him.

13:37.788 --> 13:41.788
What, and you saw that?

13:42.148 --> 13:45.307
How old were you?

13:45.308 --> 13:49.308
Ten.

13:49.428 --> 13:52.327
Are you hungry?

13:52.328 --> 13:55.023
- What are you doing now?
- Trying to bypass their firewall.

13:55.024 --> 13:58.623
It's MI5, not ASDA! We're better off
hacking into the HMG network

13:58.719 --> 14:01.598
and sending her an intranet mail.
I work with computers, I know...

14:01.599 --> 14:03.198
You're an IT consultant, Ian.

14:03.199 --> 14:06.040
If I want to know how to make
a printer work, I'll let you know.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.438
What are you two doing?

14:08.439 --> 14:11.838
Trying to get hold of Milner. We're thinking
of sending her some kind of internal mail.

14:11.872 --> 14:15.871
The only problem is,
their firewall is triple encrypted.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.710
Why don't you just call her?

14:18.711 --> 14:22.711
What? Just call MI5?

14:23.191 --> 14:27.191
With a phone?

14:27.671 --> 14:31.671
Yeah... Why not?

14:33.991 --> 14:35.949
What if they're tracing her calls?

14:35.950 --> 14:38.711
You have 42 seconds before
they can get a trace on you.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.950
Wilson, how do you know that?

14:41.951 --> 14:44.030
I saw it on Spooks.

14:44.031 --> 14:48.031
Don't be on there for more
than 30 seconds. I'll time you.

14:54.231 --> 14:56.030
'Security Service.'

14:56.031 --> 14:57.950
Hello. Could I...

14:57.951 --> 14:59.671
Could I speak to Mrs Milner, please?

14:59.672 --> 15:02.550
'One moment.'

15:02.915 --> 15:04.395
They're putting me through.

15:04.396 --> 15:06.834
'Hello, Milner.'

15:06.835 --> 15:09.034
Erm... We'd like to talk to you.

15:09.035 --> 15:10.794
We're...

15:10.795 --> 15:14.514
We're friends of Jessica Hyde.

15:14.515 --> 15:16.514
'Who?'

15:16.515 --> 15:18.914
Jessica Hyde.

15:18.915 --> 15:22.234
'Right. Sorry, does she work here?'

15:22.235 --> 15:23.714
You don't know her?

15:23.715 --> 15:27.715
'I have no idea who you're talking
about. Can I ask, who is this?'

15:28.155 --> 15:32.155
Wrong number.

15:32.955 --> 15:35.955
She said she'd never heard of her.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.833
'That line was monitored,
this isn't.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.175
'Wherever you are,
get out of there right now.'

15:45.176 --> 15:46.174
Uh... OK...

15:46.231 --> 15:49.071
'There's a chapel on Arbel Lane
in Levingstone. It's always empty.

15:49.072 --> 15:53.071
'Meet me there. Avoid CCTV.
Get out of there. Now.'

16:33.472 --> 16:34.671
Michael?

16:34.672 --> 16:37.511
Are you OK?

16:37.512 --> 16:41.512
Actually, I feel a bit ill, Jane.
Could you call in sick for me?

16:41.712 --> 16:43.351
Have you got the shits?

16:43.352 --> 16:44.991
I think so, yeah.

16:44.992 --> 16:48.992
Aw, hon! Well, I'd love to stay,
but you know how I hate the weak.

16:52.312 --> 16:56.312
Drink plenty of water
and I'll call Bev.

16:57.072 --> 16:58.911
Thanks.

16:58.912 --> 17:01.071
And no wanking in there.

17:01.072 --> 17:05.071
IVF clinic on Friday,
you dirty puppy!

17:09.392 --> 17:13.392
Ugh...

17:17.992 --> 17:19.271
Professor Donaldson.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.790
Mm? Mm? Yes?

17:21.791 --> 17:24.671
You knew Bill Kaye.

17:24.672 --> 17:26.550
Sorry, who?

17:26.551 --> 17:29.671
Bill Kaye. He was a reporter.

17:29.672 --> 17:33.672
Uh... No, no. I don't know
any reporters, actually.

17:35.272 --> 17:37.311
But he sent me to you.

17:37.312 --> 17:41.312
Well, I think someone must've
had you on 'we test' pet food.

17:46.432 --> 17:50.432
Uh... Spot check inspection.
It says 'Department of Health'.

18:15.272 --> 18:19.272
You get away from me. Stay away
from me or I swear to Christ!

18:19.472 --> 18:21.830
I'm Michael Dugdale.
Bill Kaye sent me to you.

18:21.831 --> 18:23.510
He must've told you about me.
Please!

18:23.511 --> 18:25.032
You're Michael Dugdale?

18:25.033 --> 18:28.191
Yes. Yes, that's me.

18:28.192 --> 18:30.592
Why the fuck didn't you say so
in the first place?

18:30.593 --> 18:33.511
I've got third-stage heart disease.

18:33.512 --> 18:37.512
You should eat better, then.

18:39.312 --> 18:41.071
Have you got the vaccine?

18:41.072 --> 18:43.391
No... I-I tried.

18:43.392 --> 18:47.392
Listen,
they've got Fetlar shut down.

18:47.632 --> 18:48.872
Nobody's getting in or out.

18:48.873 --> 18:51.831
No doctors,
no specialists - nothing.

18:51.832 --> 18:53.152
It all their own people.

18:53.153 --> 18:56.191
You haven't got it?

18:56.192 --> 18:57.752
Isn't there another way?

18:57.753 --> 19:01.752
Not unless you have
a corpse in your pocket.

19:04.192 --> 19:08.192
Look... I need...
I need something on them.

19:14.192 --> 19:18.192
You really have no idea who
you're dealing with, do you?

19:19.432 --> 19:21.471
No.

19:21.472 --> 19:25.472
That's why I need your help.

19:27.592 --> 19:31.231
Do you want to talk
about last night?

19:31.232 --> 19:32.911
Did you like it?

19:32.912 --> 19:34.471
Of course I liked it.

19:34.472 --> 19:38.351
Then what's there to talk about?

19:38.352 --> 19:42.352
You're such a pain in the arse!
As if life isn't difficult enough.

19:44.552 --> 19:48.071
Tell you what,
why don't we get married, Ian?

19:48.072 --> 19:52.072
Jessica can be my maid of honour.

19:56.072 --> 19:59.831
All right, I'll tell you what.

19:59.832 --> 20:03.391
I'll say it. I like you.

20:03.392 --> 20:06.511
There. I said it. It's out.

20:06.512 --> 20:10.512
So now you can punch me
or give me a Chinese burn or just...

20:10.632 --> 20:14.632
just kick me in my balls.

20:18.032 --> 20:22.032
I reckon you'd like that.

20:24.432 --> 20:28.191
Where's the other cunt?

20:28.192 --> 20:32.192
WHERE IS THE OTHER FUCKING CUNT?!

20:39.752 --> 20:42.591
Put that down.

20:42.592 --> 20:45.471
I'm... gonna... shoot...

20:45.472 --> 20:49.472
Right? Cos I don't think you are.

20:52.112 --> 20:53.831
Go on, then, shoot me.

20:53.832 --> 20:56.512
Cos if you don't put that down,
I'm gonna shoot you.

20:56.513 --> 20:58.911
Look, please...

20:58.912 --> 21:01.351
"Please"? "Please"?

21:01.352 --> 21:05.352
I'm gonna shoot you
in the fucking head, mate.

21:05.952 --> 21:08.551
I'm gonna count to three.

21:08.552 --> 21:09.991
One...

21:09.992 --> 21:11.591
Don't.

21:11.592 --> 21:15.592
Two...

21:30.672 --> 21:34.672
Did the bullet come out the front?

21:38.032 --> 21:40.432
Did the bullet come out
the front of his head?

21:40.433 --> 21:44.432
No... No, it didn't.

22:07.632 --> 22:09.311
What's your name, dear?

22:09.312 --> 22:10.671
Wilson.

22:10.672 --> 22:14.672
Nice to meet you, Wilson.
I'm Milner.

22:17.872 --> 22:21.191
Now, I need you to come round here,

22:21.192 --> 22:25.191
and fire both barrels
of that shotgun into his head.

22:25.192 --> 22:26.711
What?

22:26.712 --> 22:28.310
This is a standard issue firearm

22:28.311 --> 22:31.792
I've just signed out from ATC.
I need to cover my tracks.

22:31.793 --> 22:33.391
He's already dead.

22:33.392 --> 22:37.392
You're not killing.
You're saving my life.

22:44.992 --> 22:45.991
Oh!

22:45.992 --> 22:49.352
Oh, oh.

22:50.392 --> 22:51.432
Eugh!

22:56.272 --> 22:59.791
You OK, Wilson?

22:59.792 --> 23:03.792
Why don't you let me have that gun?

23:12.872 --> 23:16.872
How do I know this isn't a trap?

23:17.680 --> 23:19.083
How do we?

23:28.368 --> 23:31.928
Look, we've told you everything
we know. We want to... come in.

23:31.929 --> 23:34.487
Come in? Ian, there is no "in".

23:34.488 --> 23:37.008
I'm not MI5 here,
I can't protect you.

23:37.009 --> 23:38.927
What do we do?

23:38.928 --> 23:42.928
We need to find out why
they want the manuscript.

23:44.768 --> 23:47.487
I think I know.

23:47.488 --> 23:50.047
It has the identity of Mr Rabbit.

23:50.048 --> 23:53.208
Grant said, but he couldn't
remember the name.

23:53.209 --> 23:55.447
That's it.

23:55.448 --> 23:58.326
He's kept his identity secret
for nearly 30 years.

23:58.327 --> 24:01.408
That's why they're so desperate
for the manuscript.

24:01.409 --> 24:03.767
He mentioned a girl called Alice.

24:03.768 --> 24:05.806
Said that that was his girlfriend.

24:05.807 --> 24:09.808
OK. I can find out if she's come
forward. You need to go there.

24:09.894 --> 24:10.893
No. No way.

24:10.913 --> 24:14.913
We're not cops, we're not spies.
This has nothing to do with us!

24:16.081 --> 24:19.361
What did Jessica tell you
about her father's ideas, Ian?

24:19.362 --> 24:21.640
On racial purification?

24:21.641 --> 24:24.720
What? He was a fucking Nazi?

24:24.721 --> 24:28.521
Philip Carvel wrote a paper called
The Survival Of The Genome

24:28.522 --> 24:31.880
in which he advocated a human cull.

24:31.881 --> 24:35.881
This is the same man who became
involved with weaponizing disease.

24:36.201 --> 24:37.360
Right. OK.

24:37.361 --> 24:41.361
If you can't help us, we need to go.

24:42.721 --> 24:46.721
Look, I can't do this on my own.

24:49.121 --> 24:53.121
This has one number on it - mine.

24:54.881 --> 24:58.881
Why come this way around?

25:16.561 --> 25:20.561
You can hold it if you like.

25:26.281 --> 25:28.840
What if they give this room out?

25:28.841 --> 25:32.841
They won't. It's occupied.

25:33.201 --> 25:35.041
Can you teach me how to do that?

25:35.042 --> 25:37.160
There's lots I can teach you.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.680
What, to be like you?

25:39.681 --> 25:43.681
Would you like that?

25:49.841 --> 25:53.680
You need to change the way you look.

25:53.681 --> 25:55.440
Argh!

25:55.441 --> 25:57.920
Fucking hell! Argh!

25:57.921 --> 26:01.120
Argh! That fucking hurt!

26:01.121 --> 26:02.961
We are close, aren't we, Grant?

26:02.962 --> 26:06.320
To Utopia?

26:06.321 --> 26:10.321
I...need to know we're
moving in the right direction.

26:11.921 --> 26:15.919
Initial reports had indicated
that everyone who died had
an underlying health problem.

26:15.920 --> 26:19.921
However, three apparently healthy
men in their 20s are now known to...

26:20.281 --> 26:24.281
Argh! Jessica! That's my head.

26:24.321 --> 26:27.360
Nice! You look cute.

26:27.361 --> 26:31.280
You're kidding? Look,
you're making me a fucking Goth!

26:31.281 --> 26:34.880
No! You're not putting that on me!

26:34.881 --> 26:37.161
No way! You're not putting that
on me.

26:37.162 --> 26:40.040
No! You're not putting that on me.

26:40.041 --> 26:43.960
Grant, just... Just come home.

26:43.961 --> 26:47.961
Just go to the police
and we'll sort it out.

26:49.801 --> 26:53.801
Or phone Mum and we'll come
and get you. Everything'll be fine.

26:55.281 --> 26:59.281
OK, I'm here. Please, just...
Please come home.

27:01.361 --> 27:05.361
OK? It'll be all right. I know...

27:09.241 --> 27:12.040
I need to tell her I didn't do it.

27:12.041 --> 27:13.800
You know we can't, Grant.

27:13.801 --> 27:16.080
Not yet.

27:16.081 --> 27:19.960
Am I going to be normal after this?

27:19.961 --> 27:23.961
Let's drink some booze.

27:24.521 --> 27:28.521
There's a girl in Richmond,
Alice Ward.

27:31.121 --> 27:35.121
Oh, God.

27:43.401 --> 27:47.401
What was I like as a child?

27:48.721 --> 27:52.721
My earliest memory
is killing animals.

27:53.121 --> 27:55.720
Slaughterhouse. You were there.

27:55.721 --> 27:56.800
Watching.

27:56.801 --> 28:00.360
Arby, please.

28:00.361 --> 28:04.360
For as long as I can remember,
I've killed.

28:04.361 --> 28:06.640
But...

28:06.641 --> 28:10.641
Yesterday, there was a boy
holding these...

28:14.761 --> 28:17.600
and I couldn't.

28:17.601 --> 28:21.601
Arby, don't. Not now. Not know.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.840
Who are my parents?

28:25.841 --> 28:29.841
You don't have parents.

28:30.241 --> 28:34.241
You were part of a consignment -
from Bulgaria, I think.

28:36.801 --> 28:40.080
Carvel was brilliant,

28:40.081 --> 28:42.720
but he wasn't kind.

28:42.721 --> 28:46.721
Some of the things he did were,
by necessity, cruel.

28:52.641 --> 28:56.600
What about Jessica Hyde?

28:56.601 --> 29:00.601
Is she like me?
Did he do things to her?

29:01.121 --> 29:05.121
He was not a man of compassion.

29:09.201 --> 29:13.201
Lee was killed the other day.

29:13.761 --> 29:17.761
Next to you,
he's the person I knew most.

29:19.481 --> 29:22.520
Why doesn't that hurt me?

29:22.521 --> 29:26.521
Because you're not the same
as others.

29:27.121 --> 29:31.121
You're special.

29:32.041 --> 29:36.041
I don't feel special.

29:41.161 --> 29:45.161
I look mental.

29:45.561 --> 29:47.281
Like a fucking Goth.

29:49.841 --> 29:52.440
How many of those have you had?

29:52.441 --> 29:56.441
Can I have another one?

30:05.801 --> 30:09.600
What's the manuscript like, Grant?

30:09.601 --> 30:11.400
Amazing.

30:11.401 --> 30:14.560
I didn't read it all. Bits.

30:14.561 --> 30:18.561
What about... What about my dad?

30:24.761 --> 30:28.761
You are going to tell me
where it is, Grant, aren't you?

30:35.241 --> 30:39.241
Because I could make you.

30:40.161 --> 30:44.161
I could just make you tell me.

30:51.081 --> 30:55.081
I'm going to be sick.

31:18.001 --> 31:22.001
I'm sorry.

31:22.721 --> 31:26.721
Jessica... I'm sorry.

31:30.601 --> 31:34.601
I want my mum.

31:35.281 --> 31:39.281
I want my mum.

32:47.881 --> 32:49.880
Her name's Alice Ward.

32:49.881 --> 32:53.839
Her mother brought her into
Richmond police station yesterday,
she'll be back today.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.439
I'm sending an officer to get her.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.721
You need to go to her house.
That's what Jessica will do.

32:58.722 --> 33:01.200
I need a reason. Why us?

33:01.201 --> 33:05.201
What difference does it make
if we know who Mr Rabbit is?

33:06.201 --> 33:10.201
There's a story about
how he got his name.

33:10.921 --> 33:14.879
He was embedded with the criminal
underworld in Guangdong.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.681
But he was playing everyone off
against each other.

33:17.682 --> 33:20.040
The Russians, CIA, the gangs.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.480
So the Americans got fed up.

33:22.481 --> 33:26.481
And they let a particularly
nasty crime boss know
that he was their man.

33:27.441 --> 33:31.320
The boss found him.
Dragged him off the street.

33:31.321 --> 33:34.561
Right through the middle
of a busy office block.

33:34.562 --> 33:37.960
They tortured him and,
as a lesson to others,

33:37.961 --> 33:41.961
the boss carved his own name
into this man's stomach.

33:43.401 --> 33:45.000
Rabbit.

33:45.001 --> 33:48.841
Have you ever seen the
Chinese character for "rabbit", Ian?

33:48.842 --> 33:52.841
Lots of lines, lots of cuts.

33:53.121 --> 33:55.159
Somehow he managed to get free

33:55.160 --> 33:59.039
and, despite being unarmed,
he killed everyone in that room.

33:59.040 --> 34:02.879
Then he went back
through the office block
and killed everyone who'd seen him.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.881
By the time he was finished,
265 people on three continents

34:07.761 --> 34:09.520
had lost their lives,

34:09.521 --> 34:13.521
and not a single living person
knew his identity.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.360
That's who Mr Rabbit is.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.719
He is the beating heart of all this

34:20.719 --> 34:24.721
and, if we can find his identity,
it ends and you go home.

34:29.081 --> 34:30.799
I need to get across to Fetlar.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.319
Sorry, sir.
There's a quarantine in place.

34:33.320 --> 34:37.321
I'm with the Department of Health.
I have a permit of access

34:38.761 --> 34:41.480
issued by the minister.

34:41.481 --> 34:45.481
Plus an inter-department waiver,
as well as a warrant for inspection.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.280
We weren't told about all this.

34:50.281 --> 34:53.000
I've come all the way from London.

34:53.001 --> 34:57.001
I'm not turning back.

35:01.801 --> 35:05.600
Here. You'll have to call him.

35:05.601 --> 35:07.081
What, phone the minister?

35:07.082 --> 35:11.081
Yeah.

37:33.761 --> 37:36.757
A couple in here need shifting.
Let's go.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.932
Alice, we want to help Grant.

37:52.113 --> 37:56.313
Now, the kids at school,
they say they saw him with you.

37:57.393 --> 38:01.393
We just want to know
why they'd be saying that.

38:03.233 --> 38:05.193
Alice, please. Just tell him.

38:05.194 --> 38:09.193
It's OK. It takes time.

38:10.313 --> 38:13.511
We've got a new officer who's
come to ask you some questions.

38:13.512 --> 38:15.393
He'll take you somewhere else
to do that now.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.672
What is this? Who?

38:16.673 --> 38:19.953
But you'll still have our child
liaison officer, Laura, to help, OK?

38:19.954 --> 38:22.232
Here we go.

38:22.233 --> 38:26.233
Your new officer, Alice.

38:29.673 --> 38:33.673
Are you Alice Ward?

38:36.193 --> 38:40.193
Did he give you the manuscript?

38:46.233 --> 38:50.233
We're going for a drive.

39:41.673 --> 39:45.673
Can I have it, please?

39:49.473 --> 39:51.872
Grant?

39:51.873 --> 39:55.873
Can I have it, please?

40:26.553 --> 40:29.672
Give me the manuscript.

40:29.673 --> 40:33.673
What do you mean? What manuscript?

40:36.193 --> 40:40.193
Alice, what is this?

41:01.873 --> 41:03.672
It's...

41:03.760 --> 41:05.319
It's not there.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.279
It's gone.

41:08.280 --> 41:12.280
What is? What's she talking about?

41:38.480 --> 41:41.399
Tell me where it is,
or she's next.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.439
I haven't got it! Please!

41:43.440 --> 41:46.880
It was here. Please!

41:49.120 --> 41:50.678
I haven't got it, please!

41:50.679 --> 41:52.320
Please don't kill my mum!

41:52.321 --> 41:55.759
She hasn't got it!

41:55.760 --> 41:59.479
I've got it!

41:59.480 --> 42:03.480
Don't hurt my daughter, please.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.600
My name is Jessica Hyde.

42:19.851 --> 42:23.850
You know who I am
and what I'm capable of.

42:28.890 --> 42:31.129
Give me the manuscript!

42:31.130 --> 42:35.130
Or I'll kill the girl's mother!

42:40.970 --> 42:42.510
The girl's next. Give it to me!

42:42.569 --> 42:45.407
Please, Jessica, please!

42:45.408 --> 42:49.408
OK! I'll throw the weapon out.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.247
I'm giving the manuscript
to the boy.

42:53.248 --> 42:57.248
She comes in here, they get out,
you get the manuscript.

42:57.488 --> 43:01.007
If you shoot before
she's gone, he runs.

43:01.008 --> 43:03.447
OK?

43:03.448 --> 43:07.448
Do it slow.

43:14.288 --> 43:16.447
You keep these secret.

43:16.448 --> 43:20.448
Don't tell anyone
you have these, OK?

43:49.928 --> 43:53.928
Jessica, please.

43:54.408 --> 43:57.967
Drop it.

43:57.968 --> 44:01.968
Drop it!

44:22.168 --> 44:26.168
Give it me.

45:07.128 --> 45:11.128
Your father was Philip Carvel.

45:15.088 --> 45:19.088
What was he like?

45:22.088 --> 45:25.287
I don't know.

45:25.288 --> 45:29.288
That's why I wanted that.

45:33.368 --> 45:37.368
Where is Jessica Hyde?

45:54.088 --> 45:55.527
Come on.

45:55.528 --> 45:56.928
Grant! Get in the van!

45:56.929 --> 46:00.928
Come on! Get in.

46:52.368 --> 46:54.446
'I would have laughed, really hard.'

46:54.447 --> 46:56.248
'We were doing our best not to.'

46:56.249 --> 46:58.087
And there he is!

46:58.088 --> 47:01.346
Hello! We didn't hear you come in.
Look who's popped round.

47:01.358 --> 47:02.577
The Minister's been telling me...

47:02.674 --> 47:05.515
Jen, for God's sake, do not call
me "the Minister", please!

47:05.516 --> 47:08.514
I hope you don't mind, Michael,

47:08.515 --> 47:10.753
but Jen and I have been
getting rather personal.

47:10.754 --> 47:13.795
Geoff and his wife did IVF, too,
and they were at it for years.

47:13.796 --> 47:17.554
For five fucking years. Christ!

47:17.555 --> 47:20.233
I think the worst part is that
there are things you can't share.

47:20.234 --> 47:23.073
I mean, Sam was being pumped
so full of those hormones

47:23.137 --> 47:24.898
that you just think, "Christ..."

47:24.899 --> 47:28.537
It really can test a marriage.

47:28.538 --> 47:30.498
But now we have two beautiful boys

47:30.499 --> 47:34.297
who we wouldn't exchange
for the world, so...

47:34.298 --> 47:37.098
Jen, do you mind if I just
have a quick word with Michael?

47:37.099 --> 47:38.817
Oh, of course, of course.

47:38.818 --> 47:40.216
Just boring Ministerial stuff, so...

47:40.301 --> 47:41.822
No, no. Yes, of course.

47:41.823 --> 47:45.822
Thank you.

47:47.579 --> 47:48.858
She's great.

47:48.859 --> 47:52.859
Just great.

47:52.899 --> 47:56.899
It would be such a shame
to see her raped.

47:58.019 --> 48:01.719
Hand it over...

48:01.785 --> 48:03.544
or Jen will be raped.

48:03.545 --> 48:07.545
Brutally, Michael.
Later this week.

48:19.425 --> 48:22.384
Is that all of it?

48:22.385 --> 48:26.385
Do you think I kept a piece?

48:26.705 --> 48:30.705
What kind of idiot uses his own ID?
You are so fucking ridiculous.

48:33.505 --> 48:37.225
They wanted just to snatch you.
Pick you up on your way home.

48:37.226 --> 48:40.784
Torture you. Kill you.
Jen, as well, but I said no.

48:40.785 --> 48:44.664
"He's useful. He's a friend
in the department.

48:44.665 --> 48:46.465
"Let me deal with him," I said.

48:46.466 --> 48:50.465
"Because I know
I can get him onside."

48:50.865 --> 48:52.623
Michael, if you work with me,

48:52.624 --> 48:56.625
there's a really good chance that
I could make your life wonderful.

48:57.865 --> 49:00.585
But if you work against me,
just one more time,

49:00.586 --> 49:04.544
I will make your life over.

49:04.545 --> 49:08.545
Is that clear?

49:19.585 --> 49:23.585
'Oh. Are you off?'

49:23.945 --> 49:25.465
'Take care. See you soon.'

49:25.466 --> 49:29.465
'Yes. It was lovely to meet you...'

49:35.809 --> 49:37.129
'Bye.'

49:45.000 --> 50:22.315
