00:00.451 --> 00:02.398
Previously on Once Upon A Time...

00:02.398 --> 00:04.961
- Regina's doing what?
- She's going undercover.

00:05.147 --> 00:06.316
They're after The Author, too.

00:06.316 --> 00:07.842
They feel the only way
to get their happy ending

00:07.842 --> 00:09.297
is to destroy yours.

00:09.297 --> 00:10.450
May I come in?

00:11.948 --> 00:14.549
No amount of
torture will work on him.

00:14.583 --> 00:16.251
But it will succeed on
the man he used to be.

00:16.285 --> 00:18.486
I know there's something
about your past with Ursula

00:18.520 --> 00:19.620
you're not telling me.

00:19.655 --> 00:21.089
- Did you break her heart?
- Worse.

00:46.681 --> 00:49.993
Mr. Smee, we are to return to
Neverland with a full hold...

00:50.414 --> 00:52.014
not full bellies.

00:52.048 --> 00:53.081
Come on, captain.

00:53.116 --> 00:54.784
Pan will never notice if
a few cakes are missing.

00:54.818 --> 00:55.818
You can eat as many cakes as you want

00:55.852 --> 00:58.787
after I find a way to
destroy the Dark One.

00:58.822 --> 01:01.423
Until then, we keep pan happy.

01:01.457 --> 01:02.357
Of course.

01:05.795 --> 01:07.462
Do you hear that?

01:24.447 --> 01:26.981
It's beautiful.

01:48.135 --> 01:50.637
Rocks dead ahead!

02:02.516 --> 02:05.485
That voice, captain...
What was it?

02:05.519 --> 02:09.856
The most dangerous
creature in all the seas...

02:09.890 --> 02:11.291
a mermaid.

02:22.703 --> 02:25.538
Why did you let that ship go?

02:25.572 --> 02:27.840
I'm sorry, father, but I couldn't.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.175
But I told you to.

02:30.210 --> 02:31.511
And I'm...

02:31.545 --> 02:33.379
Poseidon, king of the sea.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.580
Yes, yes. I know, but still...

02:36.649 --> 02:40.152
I want to use my voice
to make people happy,

02:40.186 --> 02:41.353
not to hurt them.

02:41.388 --> 02:44.156
That's what your mother wanted,

02:44.190 --> 02:46.658
and look what happened to her.

02:46.692 --> 02:48.961
I miss her, too, father.

02:48.995 --> 02:51.329
But she's the one that taught me to sing,

02:51.363 --> 02:54.065
and I know she wouldn't want
me to use my voice like this.

02:54.099 --> 02:57.702
She also wouldn't want you to
let her murderers sail free.

02:57.737 --> 03:00.505
She would want you to avenge her death.

03:00.540 --> 03:01.840
No! That's what you want!

03:01.874 --> 03:03.542
Just because one human hurt mother

03:03.576 --> 03:05.243
doesn't mean they're all bad.

03:05.277 --> 03:06.445
Enough!

03:06.479 --> 03:11.382
As long as you live in my
ocean, you will live by my rules.

03:11.417 --> 03:13.751
Then maybe I don't want
to live in your ocean.

03:13.785 --> 03:16.154
Ursula, pout all you want,

03:16.188 --> 03:19.057
but I expect you home by high tide.

03:37.041 --> 03:38.509
Darling. Come.

03:38.543 --> 03:40.243
You're missing out on all the fun.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.182
I already told you...

03:45.216 --> 03:46.883
I don't know anything about this author.

03:48.219 --> 03:51.021
Well, perhaps you could
use a little incentive.

03:51.055 --> 03:53.223
Oh, that knife is not gonna
make me remember something

03:53.257 --> 03:54.524
- that I don't know.
- Wait.

03:56.594 --> 03:58.628
Is there a problem?

03:58.662 --> 04:00.630
I knew she'd never the stomach for this.

04:00.664 --> 04:01.464
Please.

04:01.499 --> 04:02.465
I was torturing people

04:02.500 --> 04:04.601
back when you were still
playing with puppies.

04:04.635 --> 04:08.471
This sorry excuse for a
man used to be made of wood.

04:08.506 --> 04:11.440
So let's light a fire under
him and see what happens.

04:16.346 --> 04:19.581
Okay. All right.

04:19.616 --> 04:21.149
You know something?

04:21.184 --> 04:25.087
I actually, uh, do remember
something about The Author.

04:28.458 --> 04:29.591
Um...

04:29.626 --> 04:32.227
Don't hold out on us.

04:32.261 --> 04:35.731
W-when I was in Hong Kong,
uh, before the curse broke,

04:35.765 --> 04:38.099
I met a mystic.

04:38.134 --> 04:39.635
His name was The Dragon.

04:39.669 --> 04:41.737
I don't know how he
knew about the book,

04:41.771 --> 04:46.074
but he had been looking
for The Author for years.

04:46.108 --> 04:48.109
And what did this "dragon" learn?

04:48.144 --> 04:50.111
He died before I could ask.

04:50.146 --> 04:52.847
Oh, well, that's something you
two are about to have in common.

04:52.881 --> 04:56.584
And after he died... I took his research.

04:56.618 --> 04:59.454
And I brought it with me to Storybrooke.

04:59.488 --> 05:01.622
Do you really
think this man-child

05:01.657 --> 05:03.758
is telling us the truth?

05:03.792 --> 05:06.961
Well, it wouldn't be the first
time he's lied to my face.

05:06.995 --> 05:09.030
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pay a visit

05:09.064 --> 05:11.532
to his trailer to find out.

05:11.567 --> 05:13.634
While you're doing that,

05:13.669 --> 05:15.603
shall we carry on with
the rest of the plan?

05:15.637 --> 05:17.705
Rest of the plan?

05:17.739 --> 05:19.673
What aren't you telling me?

05:19.707 --> 05:22.176
You're gonna have to do a lot
more than just kidnap a marionette

05:22.210 --> 05:25.712
and torch a few logs for
us to tell you everything.

05:25.746 --> 05:27.381
In the meantime,

05:27.415 --> 05:31.051
be content that you've finally
chosen the winning side.

05:49.704 --> 05:51.504
It's okay, Emma.

05:51.538 --> 05:53.739
As long as he's with Regina,
Pinocchio will be all right.

05:53.773 --> 05:54.607
We don't know that.

05:54.641 --> 05:56.709
I just wish I hadn't let her ditch me.

05:56.743 --> 05:57.876
Swan, you couldn't have known

05:57.911 --> 05:58.920
that she'd drop that tracking device.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.523
Yeah, but I let her talk me into thinking

06:00.523 --> 06:02.156
kidnapping him was a good idea.

06:02.190 --> 06:04.125
If anything happens to
that kid, it's my fault.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.063
Uh, the tracks end here.

06:09.097 --> 06:10.898
Looks like the rain washed them away.

06:10.932 --> 06:13.100
Oh, would now be an appropriate
time for a locator spell?

06:13.492 --> 06:15.125
We may not need one.

06:15.159 --> 06:16.460
Look.

06:29.923 --> 06:30.740
Mary Margaret.

06:30.829 --> 06:31.938
What the hell was that? Are you okay?

06:31.938 --> 06:32.922
I have to make this quick.

06:32.922 --> 06:33.911
We don't have much time.

06:35.146 --> 06:37.480
- Regina?
- Pinocchio's fine.

06:37.515 --> 06:40.717
He's back to his
old self, or older self.

06:40.751 --> 06:41.856
August.

06:41.856 --> 06:43.520
But there's something
else you need to know...

06:43.554 --> 06:44.335
Gold is here.

06:46.279 --> 06:47.515
We're holed up in his cabin,

06:47.709 --> 06:49.125
and he's in town for
more than just The Author.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.192
But he won't tell me why,

06:50.227 --> 06:53.530
which means whatever it is
he's planning... it's bad.

06:58.402 --> 07:00.502
So the Dark One's returned.

07:00.537 --> 07:01.703
Yeah.

07:02.973 --> 07:06.208
There's only one person who
can help us drive him back out.

07:06.243 --> 07:07.555
H-h-he's here?

07:08.684 --> 07:10.667
Th-that's...
That's impossible.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.748
Well, did you really
think he'd stay away?

07:12.782 --> 07:15.417
The dagger... you
need to hand it over

07:15.452 --> 07:16.919
so we can stop this
fight before it starts.

07:16.953 --> 07:18.053
The dagger?

07:18.087 --> 07:20.088
I-I don't have the dagger.

07:20.122 --> 07:21.189
Killian does.

07:23.292 --> 07:25.060
Who? Me?

07:25.094 --> 07:26.929
Well, I haven't seen that cursed blade

07:26.963 --> 07:29.565
since you commanded the
Crocodile to leave the first time.

07:29.599 --> 07:31.899
But y-you took it from me last night

07:31.934 --> 07:34.202
to hide it where no one could find it.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.703
After the lifetimes I spent searching

07:35.737 --> 07:37.339
for a way to destroy the Dark One,

07:37.373 --> 07:39.707
I'm pretty certain I'd remember
holding that dagger in my hand.

07:39.741 --> 07:42.610
Okay, well, if I didn't
give it to you, then who...

07:42.644 --> 07:45.447
you gave it to Gold... Disguised as you.

07:45.481 --> 07:46.581
He's back, and so is his power.

07:48.116 --> 07:52.954
Even when I didn't think he
could deceive me anymore...

07:52.988 --> 07:54.622
He found a way.

07:54.656 --> 07:56.390
Banishment was too good for that demon.

07:56.424 --> 07:58.425
We should have driven that
dagger through his heart

07:58.460 --> 07:59.460
when we had the chance.

07:59.495 --> 08:01.174
Then your name would
be written across it.

08:01.174 --> 08:01.944
It's a small price to pay

08:01.944 --> 08:03.789
to ensure the Crocodile
wouldn't come back again.

08:03.789 --> 08:06.039
I know you're angry, but we defeated
him before and we'll do it again.

08:06.039 --> 08:07.054
Yeah, but the question is, how?

08:07.054 --> 08:08.135
We don't even know what he's planning.

08:08.135 --> 08:09.371
First, we save August.

08:09.785 --> 08:11.738
Yeah. You do that.

08:11.772 --> 08:13.740
I'll find out the Dark One's secret.

08:13.774 --> 08:15.376
How are you gonna do that?

08:16.649 --> 08:18.415
The sea witch Ursula.

08:19.128 --> 08:20.881
Remember when I said
I had a past with her?

08:20.915 --> 08:22.048
Now's the time to use it.

08:22.082 --> 08:23.116
How?

08:23.150 --> 08:25.585
By taking a page out of your book, Swan.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.721
I'm gonna return her happy ending.

08:27.755 --> 08:30.156
Can you really do that?

08:30.190 --> 08:31.424
Aye.

08:31.458 --> 08:34.594
Because I'm the one who took
it from her in the first place.

08:43.203 --> 08:47.673
What's that... more kindling?

08:50.619 --> 08:52.719
This page appeared to
someone very important to me.

08:52.939 --> 08:54.873
Robin Hood?

08:58.236 --> 09:01.271
How do you know about Robin Hood?

09:01.305 --> 09:05.108
Just 'cause the boy
doesn't remember being me

09:05.142 --> 09:08.311
doesn't mean I don't
remember being the boy.

09:08.346 --> 09:11.982
Well, you're right.

09:12.016 --> 09:14.885
Robin did find it.

09:14.919 --> 09:17.520
But this page...

09:19.923 --> 09:22.392
it depicts something that didn't happen.

09:22.426 --> 09:25.201
And I think you know
more than you're saying.

09:28.791 --> 09:29.899
What's the matter, darling?

09:29.899 --> 09:31.833
Is there something out there?

09:31.868 --> 09:33.201
It's nothing.

09:33.235 --> 09:35.670
Just gonna go stretch my tentacles.

09:41.438 --> 09:43.472
Where is that infernal creature?

09:48.078 --> 09:50.479
Right here, captain.

09:50.514 --> 09:53.015
Wait. I want to offer you a deal.

09:53.049 --> 09:55.050
After what you did to me? I don't think so.

09:55.084 --> 09:56.185
Gold was wrong.

09:56.219 --> 09:59.655
You don't have to find the
author to get what you want.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.226
And why should I believe a word you say?

10:05.261 --> 10:08.664
Because I know what it is you desire.

10:08.698 --> 10:11.900
And I know exactly where to get it.

10:11.934 --> 10:13.935
You still have it?

10:13.970 --> 10:16.672
The Dark One...

10:16.706 --> 10:18.573
he's here for more than just The Author.

10:18.607 --> 10:19.841
If I return your happy ending,

10:19.876 --> 10:24.045
you're gonna tell me exactly
what he's doing in Storybrooke.

10:26.982 --> 10:30.051
You got yourself a deal.

11:16.330 --> 11:18.098
I'd recognize that voice anywhere.

11:18.132 --> 11:21.968
You're the mermaid who
nearly sank my ship.

11:23.137 --> 11:26.072
But you didn't.

11:26.107 --> 11:28.708
For that, I owe you a drink.

11:31.144 --> 11:34.146
After I let you escape, my father said

11:34.180 --> 11:37.816
I had to obey his rules if I
wanted to live in his ocean.

11:37.851 --> 11:41.153
Ah. I see you don't
take well to ultimatums.

11:42.055 --> 11:44.322
I broke into his vault and stole this.

11:44.357 --> 11:46.859
It lets me walk on land.

11:46.893 --> 11:48.227
Well, you're a brave lass.

11:51.631 --> 11:54.166
My father wasn't always
so cruel, you know.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.333
He used to be happy.

11:55.368 --> 11:59.037
Listening to my mother and
me sing used to bring him joy.

11:59.072 --> 12:01.506
What changed, love?

12:04.209 --> 12:06.978
My mother was killed...

12:07.012 --> 12:08.980
By a pirate.

12:09.014 --> 12:11.149
That's why he forbade me to sing,

12:11.183 --> 12:13.385
except to guide sailors to their doom.

12:13.419 --> 12:16.020
He turned my voice into a weapon.

12:16.054 --> 12:21.058
But it's all I have left of my mother.

12:21.093 --> 12:24.962
Singing is the only way
to keep her spirit alive.

12:24.997 --> 12:28.132
You have a rare gift.

12:28.167 --> 12:31.969
Your voice can soothe
even the most haunted soul.

12:32.004 --> 12:34.204
You really think so?

12:36.274 --> 12:39.176
For almost a century,

12:39.210 --> 12:42.012
my every waking moment

12:42.046 --> 12:44.748
has been consumed
by one thought...

12:44.783 --> 12:48.051
making an evil man pay

12:48.085 --> 12:51.087
for what he did to the woman I loved.

12:51.122 --> 12:54.024
Listening to your voice...

12:56.260 --> 12:58.594
took away that pain.

12:58.629 --> 13:01.932
If even just for a brief moment.

13:01.966 --> 13:06.269
That's all I ever wanted
To make people happy.

13:06.304 --> 13:09.405
Well, that's what you're doing.

13:10.941 --> 13:14.176
So, why are you singing
in this rat's nest?

13:14.211 --> 13:16.679
I'm saving for passage to Glowerhaven.

13:16.714 --> 13:19.449
My mother said it was her
favorite place to sing.

13:19.483 --> 13:21.718
I'm trying to earn enough gold...

13:21.752 --> 13:23.518
oh, you don't need
gold for that trip.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.020
I won't?

13:25.055 --> 13:26.559
Not if I take you.

13:27.436 --> 13:29.725
You'd really do that for me?

13:29.759 --> 13:32.261
Meet me at the docks tomorrow morning.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.901
So, where exactly did
you bury my treasure?

13:39.935 --> 13:42.604
Oh, I didn't bury what you're
after. It's aboard the Jolly Roger.

13:42.638 --> 13:44.439
So where's the Jolly Roger?

13:44.474 --> 13:45.574
Ha.

13:45.608 --> 13:47.776
Back in the Enchanted Forest.

13:47.810 --> 13:50.144
Now, can you still open
portals underwater,

13:50.179 --> 13:51.747
or did you give up that power

13:51.781 --> 13:53.715
when you became the monster you are?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.484
The monster that you made me.

13:56.491 --> 13:58.590
- Can you open the portal or not?
- Yes, I can.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.256
But I'm afraid I'll need
something from the Jolly Roger

14:01.290 --> 14:03.391
to know exactly where it is.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.329
Piece of the rigging.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.298
Did you really think I'd trade my ship

14:10.332 --> 14:12.100
without taking a souvenir?

14:16.304 --> 14:19.907
What's the matter...
you don't like the ocean?

14:19.941 --> 14:22.175
I haven't dipped my toe in the sea

14:22.210 --> 14:24.378
since I was banished to this world.

14:25.881 --> 14:28.248
Stand back.

14:41.562 --> 14:43.096
It didn't work.

14:44.299 --> 14:45.732
Yes, it did.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.636
Bloody hell.

14:49.670 --> 14:53.473
Looks like you're not the
only thing that's changed.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.210
The last man who tailed me ended
up with a dagger in his gut.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.743
You dare drag me onto my own ship?

15:28.412 --> 15:29.443
You're a dead man.

15:29.443 --> 15:31.044
You listen to me.

15:31.078 --> 15:32.445
My daughter is not

15:32.479 --> 15:35.815
going anywhere near
this vessel tomorrow.

15:35.850 --> 15:39.886
Well, threatening me isn't
gonna make her change her mind.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.456
I don't need to change her mind.

15:43.490 --> 15:44.923
You do.

15:44.958 --> 15:47.393
How's a seashell gonna help me?

15:51.865 --> 15:57.436
It's now enchanted to take away
her reason to leave... her voice.

15:57.471 --> 16:00.572
Or rather, her singing voice.

16:00.606 --> 16:04.343
If she can't sing, she'll return
to the sea, where she belongs.

16:04.377 --> 16:06.979
She told me what that voice means to her.

16:09.448 --> 16:12.584
I won't betray her, not
since she spared my ship.

16:16.389 --> 16:19.090
What if I could offer you a
way to destroy the Dark One?

16:19.124 --> 16:22.427
What do you know about my
feud with the Crocodile?

16:22.461 --> 16:25.096
I know you've spent a lifetime
searching for a way to kill him.

16:25.130 --> 16:29.601
I can offer you magic that
will finally set you free.

16:29.635 --> 16:31.836
What kind of magic do you mean?

16:31.871 --> 16:32.904
Squid ink.

16:32.938 --> 16:37.875
A single drop is potent
enough to paralyze any being,

16:37.910 --> 16:40.778
even Rumplestiltskin.

16:40.812 --> 16:42.479
And all I have to do

16:42.514 --> 16:44.982
is steal your daughter's singing voice?

16:45.017 --> 16:47.118
It's simple, pirate.

16:47.152 --> 16:51.955
Just show her how awful
humans really can be.

17:00.398 --> 17:02.499
Do hope we're not interrupting,

17:02.534 --> 17:04.568
but we need the thief's assistance.

17:04.602 --> 17:07.904
And how do I know
That you're really Killian?

17:07.939 --> 17:09.672
Oh, now you decide
to question my identity?

17:09.705 --> 17:11.340
If he were the Dark One,

17:11.375 --> 17:12.976
lover boy here would already be dead.

17:13.010 --> 17:15.178
Yeah, she's got a point there.

17:15.212 --> 17:17.146
But why should I help you?

17:17.181 --> 17:20.383
Because for once, we want the
same thing... the Dark One gone.

17:20.417 --> 17:23.986
The key to making that happen is in here.

17:25.722 --> 17:27.990
Right.

17:28.023 --> 17:29.559
That your ship, is it?

17:30.594 --> 17:33.195
- Bit small, isn't it?
- Careful, mate.

17:33.229 --> 17:36.165
It's unwise to insult the
size of a pirate's ship.

17:36.199 --> 17:38.834
And you spent more time in
wonderland than anyone I know.

17:38.868 --> 17:41.136
You must have something
that can restore it.

17:42.572 --> 17:44.206
You're in luck.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.408
I think I might have just what you need.

17:52.815 --> 17:55.817
Regina!

17:59.054 --> 18:01.590
Robin?

18:01.624 --> 18:03.091
Regina!

18:03.125 --> 18:06.561
Robin!

18:06.596 --> 18:07.929
I don't understand.

18:07.964 --> 18:09.798
How did you get here?

18:09.832 --> 18:11.532
That doesn't matter.

18:11.566 --> 18:15.436
The only thing that matters
is I'm here with you now.

18:21.343 --> 18:23.511
Someone's watching.

18:25.580 --> 18:28.816
What the hell are you doing here?

18:28.850 --> 18:31.519
Get away from him!

18:36.457 --> 18:38.158
If you're having trouble sleeping,

18:38.192 --> 18:39.894
I have something that might help.

18:39.928 --> 18:42.563
I'm fine. Thank you.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.503
Hello, dearies.

18:49.537 --> 18:52.472
Tell us... did you find
anything at the puppet's trailer?

18:52.507 --> 18:54.408
Of course not.

18:54.442 --> 18:55.542
I didn't even look.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.280
The man's a born liar.

19:01.649 --> 19:04.651
He never would have cracked so easily.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.620
Instead, I paid a visit to the fairies.

19:07.655 --> 19:10.857
Or rather, a visit to their
ample supply of magic.

19:10.891 --> 19:13.593
Now, this potion can temporarily reverse

19:13.627 --> 19:15.995
any spell those do-gooders cast.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.864
They made him real.

19:18.898 --> 19:21.767
This can undo that.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.639
I promise you, deary...
This is gonna hurt.

19:45.758 --> 19:48.660
Now...

19:48.695 --> 19:52.163
Let's see if we can pull
this puppet's strings.

20:01.321 --> 20:03.387
Gold's cabin's up ahead.
We go on foot from here.

20:03.774 --> 20:04.990
Anything from Hook?

20:05.024 --> 20:06.984
Think he's managed to turn Ursula yet?

20:06.984 --> 20:07.993
If she hasn't turned him.

20:08.027 --> 20:09.483
Really? We're thinking that now?

20:09.483 --> 20:11.098
Well, he kind of went to
a dark place this morning.

20:11.098 --> 20:12.842
Do you blame him? If Gold
did to me what he did to Hook,

20:12.842 --> 20:15.100
I'd want to shove that
dagger through his heart, too.

20:15.134 --> 20:17.213
Emma, that's not you.
You're not...

20:17.213 --> 20:18.804
it's also not Hook. Relax.

20:18.838 --> 20:21.273
I'm just saying I understood
where he was coming from.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.473
Come on.

20:22.508 --> 20:24.742
Gold might not hurt a kid, but August?

20:24.777 --> 20:26.611
Who knows what he'll do to him?

20:45.548 --> 20:48.598
When you said it was temporary, you
weren't kidding, were you, darling?

20:48.633 --> 20:52.669
You see, you may no longer look
like the puppet you once were,

20:52.704 --> 20:54.138
but it matters not.

20:54.172 --> 20:56.473
That potion you just drank

20:56.507 --> 21:00.477
has activated that...
built-in lie detector of yours.

21:00.511 --> 21:04.481
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:12.690 --> 21:14.123
Excellent.

21:14.158 --> 21:18.627
The next lie is gonna hurt.

21:24.034 --> 21:27.003
What do you know about The Author?

21:27.037 --> 21:28.838
I already told you everything.

21:31.408 --> 21:32.808
Try again, deary.

21:32.843 --> 21:33.910
Where is he?

21:33.944 --> 21:36.211
I don't know.

21:36.246 --> 21:38.481
Do not fool yourself.

21:38.515 --> 21:40.082
I will get my answer.

21:40.116 --> 21:41.183
- Okay.
- Where is he?

21:41.217 --> 21:43.686
All right. I'm gonna tell
you what you want to know.

21:45.121 --> 21:49.224
The Sorcerer, uh, trapped
The Author behind a door.

21:49.259 --> 21:51.193
The Sorcerer? A door?

21:51.227 --> 21:53.195
He's speaking in riddles.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.264
No, listen to me, Gold.

21:55.298 --> 21:57.032
You know about the sorcerer.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.034
You know I'm telling the truth.

22:00.203 --> 22:05.974
And she... she knows about the door.

22:07.310 --> 22:10.578
I know my papa gave you my things.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.749
There was a page that
I took out of the book.

22:14.784 --> 22:17.184
Had an illustration of the door on it.

22:20.155 --> 22:22.791
Regina?

22:22.825 --> 22:25.859
They were just scraps of paper.

22:25.894 --> 22:28.796
Then you'll have no problem
sharing them with us now.

22:28.830 --> 22:32.900
Well, I would if I hadn't
already given them to Henry.

22:36.939 --> 22:39.740
Do you remember what the door looks like?

22:39.774 --> 22:43.109
Uh...

22:43.144 --> 22:45.646
Made of wood.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.582
Hand-carved frame. Gilt in gold.

22:48.616 --> 22:51.151
Where is the door?

22:51.185 --> 22:54.521
All I know... Is...

22:57.124 --> 22:59.292
it's somewhere in Storybrooke.

23:08.202 --> 23:11.438
There we are, now.

23:11.472 --> 23:14.841
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

23:17.945 --> 23:21.313
Since the sorcerer was the
one who did the trapping,

23:21.348 --> 23:25.084
we will start our search
for the door at his mansion.

23:25.118 --> 23:27.152
Maleficent.

23:27.187 --> 23:30.356
I'll stay here and watch the puppet.

23:30.390 --> 23:31.490
No, no.

23:31.524 --> 23:33.658
Cruella will be our guard dog.

23:33.693 --> 23:37.829
Since you're the only one who's
seen the drawing of the door,

23:37.864 --> 23:40.499
you're gonna have to help us find it.

23:46.531 --> 23:47.830
Be careful, love.

23:48.223 --> 23:50.316
That's distilled from
wonderland's finest mushrooms.

23:50.316 --> 23:51.943
Spill one drop, and, well,

23:51.978 --> 23:55.279
Storybrooke will have a
giant squid in its harbor.

24:12.431 --> 24:15.366
Now that's a ship fit for a pirate.

24:24.776 --> 24:26.243
Mr. Smee, clear the deck.

24:30.549 --> 24:33.523
I'd like a moment alone with our guest.

24:43.061 --> 24:44.661
I hope you don't mind.

24:44.695 --> 24:48.065
I thought your crew might
like something to work by.

24:48.099 --> 24:49.666
Aye. It's beautiful.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.235
I'm afraid I've got
something to show you.

24:58.075 --> 25:00.944
I know what that is.
Why do you have that?

25:00.978 --> 25:02.568
- Please don't use it!
- Don't worry.

25:02.922 --> 25:04.091
I won't.

25:04.989 --> 25:08.381
But you must know...
your father gave this to me.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.710
He thought you'd return home
if you could no longer sing.

25:11.269 --> 25:13.632
In exchange for helping him,
he offered me squid ink...

25:14.287 --> 25:16.311
a weapon that would finally
let me get my revenge

25:16.311 --> 25:17.401
against the Dark One.

25:17.552 --> 25:21.488
And you would sacrifice
that prize for me?

25:21.523 --> 25:23.783
I know that voice

25:24.550 --> 25:27.785
is the only thing you
have left of your mother.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.721
If I had something left of my love...

25:32.324 --> 25:34.559
Look, I may be a pirate...

25:35.827 --> 25:38.096
but I have a code.

25:38.130 --> 25:40.798
And I promise to never
take that voice from you.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.532
But that means you'll remain trapped

25:42.567 --> 25:43.767
as pan's servant forever.

25:43.802 --> 25:44.802
Not necessarily.

25:44.836 --> 25:48.538
You stole that bracelet
from your father's vault.

25:49.908 --> 25:52.876
I'd wager that's where
he keeps the squid ink.

25:52.911 --> 25:56.080
You want me to steal it for you.

25:56.114 --> 25:59.882
I'll take you to Glowerhaven
and wherever else you want to go.

25:59.917 --> 26:01.951
Then we can both get what we want.

26:01.986 --> 26:03.953
Aye.

26:03.988 --> 26:06.756
Now you're thinking like a pirate.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.329
Mm.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.764
I never thought I'd walk
this sweet vessel again.

26:14.798 --> 26:16.833
Yes, well, you can ogle your ship

26:16.867 --> 26:18.768
after you return my singing voice.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.982
Now, you know the deal
I hand this over,

26:34.017 --> 26:36.918
you tell me every detail
of the Dark One's plan.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.361
Oh, you hear that?

26:45.395 --> 26:47.029
Aye.

26:52.835 --> 26:54.102
It didn't work.

26:54.137 --> 26:55.336
Why the devil not?

26:56.405 --> 26:59.041
Because you're wrong, Hook.

26:59.075 --> 27:02.711
Villains can't get their happy endings.

27:02.745 --> 27:04.379
I never should have believed you

27:04.413 --> 27:06.381
when you said we could do
this without The Author.

27:06.415 --> 27:08.616
I delivered your voice.

27:08.651 --> 27:10.051
It's not my fault if your magic

27:10.085 --> 27:12.019
can't get it out of the bloody shell.

27:12.054 --> 27:13.621
Now tell me what Gold has planned.

27:13.656 --> 27:15.723
Our deal is over. You get nothing!

27:15.757 --> 27:17.958
Our deal is not done.

27:19.228 --> 27:20.895
I have to stop the Dark One.

27:20.929 --> 27:23.030
He's taken too much from me already.

27:23.065 --> 27:24.732
You haven't changed one bit.

27:24.766 --> 27:26.967
Still the same selfish pirate, as always.

27:28.003 --> 27:30.204
Never go up against a
woman with eight hands,

27:30.238 --> 27:32.372
especially when you only have one.

27:33.441 --> 27:36.010
Have a nice swim, Captain.

27:54.394 --> 27:56.095
Don't worry.

27:56.129 --> 27:58.598
You can thank me later.

28:04.037 --> 28:06.171
Are you okay?

28:06.206 --> 28:08.107
Aye.

28:08.141 --> 28:09.308
Good.

28:10.390 --> 28:12.097
That's for tossing black beard overboard

28:12.175 --> 28:14.176
before he could tell me where Eric was.

28:14.211 --> 28:16.019
I had to rescue that
awful man to find him.

28:16.215 --> 28:17.329
Then why are you here?

28:17.329 --> 28:19.949
I thought you and your prince
were living happily ever after.

28:19.983 --> 28:22.451
I was, until I got trapped in that bottle.

28:23.586 --> 28:25.955
After you traded the
Jolly Roger to black beard,

28:25.989 --> 28:28.523
he used your ship to
terrorize a lot of people,

28:28.558 --> 28:30.525
including some royals from Arendelle.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.361
The queen trapped
your ship as punishment.

28:32.395 --> 28:34.130
Elsa did that?

28:34.164 --> 28:36.498
And I accidentally got
swept up in the magic,

28:36.532 --> 28:39.033
so thanks for letting me out.

28:40.503 --> 28:41.803
Was that the real Ursula?

28:41.837 --> 28:43.639
Why was she throwing you overboard?

28:43.673 --> 28:47.452
Because I was so focused
on getting what I want,

28:47.452 --> 28:49.177
I made a promise to
her I couldn't deliver.

28:49.211 --> 28:51.747
Maybe she was right.

28:51.781 --> 28:55.516
Maybe villains can't get
their happy endings.

28:55.550 --> 28:56.751
Maybe that's because villains

28:56.786 --> 28:58.820
always go about getting
them the wrong way.

29:01.556 --> 29:03.992
I'm gonna need your help.

29:04.026 --> 29:07.228
I trust that you didn't
run into any trouble.

29:07.263 --> 29:09.397
Nothing I couldn't handle.

29:10.865 --> 29:13.934
I've waited a century for this.

29:13.968 --> 29:17.371
I couldn't have done this
without your help, Ursula.

29:17.406 --> 29:21.041
So, tell me, where do
you want to go to first?

29:21.075 --> 29:24.011
You're not taking her anywhere.

29:24.979 --> 29:26.380
Stand down, men.

29:26.415 --> 29:30.184
This is between me and the sea king.

29:30.218 --> 29:31.451
No! It's about me.

29:31.485 --> 29:33.253
Hook told me what you asked him to do.

29:33.288 --> 29:35.923
You were trying to take away

29:35.957 --> 29:38.625
the only thing I have left of mother.

29:38.659 --> 29:40.994
So I wouldn't lose you
the way I lost her.

29:42.496 --> 29:44.631
You may have fooled my daughter,

29:44.665 --> 29:47.033
but I know exactly what you are.

29:47.067 --> 29:51.270
You only care about one
thing... your vengeance.

29:52.506 --> 29:54.040
Now you'll never get it.

29:54.074 --> 29:56.075
You have no idea what you've just done.

29:58.813 --> 30:01.613
You dare attack a deity?

30:06.753 --> 30:09.788
I don't have to kill
you to make you suffer.

30:09.823 --> 30:14.393
I know I'm not the only
one consumed by vengeance.

30:15.462 --> 30:18.597
No!

30:24.838 --> 30:28.407
Now you'll never sink
another ship with this.

30:29.876 --> 30:30.942
How could you?

30:30.977 --> 30:33.178
You said you had a code.

30:33.212 --> 30:34.679
You said you'd never steal my voice.

30:34.713 --> 30:36.314
That was before your father

30:36.349 --> 30:39.417
destroyed my one chance at revenge.

30:39.451 --> 30:43.021
My father is a tyrant,
but you're no better.

30:43.055 --> 30:44.689
Keep it.

30:44.723 --> 30:47.725
If this is what humans are
like, no one deserves to hear it.

30:49.328 --> 30:50.795
Ursula!

30:53.164 --> 30:54.231
Give me the shell.

30:54.266 --> 30:57.735
And give you the satisfaction
of returning it to her?

31:01.473 --> 31:04.308
Now go.

31:04.342 --> 31:09.280
Before I destroy it and
everything you hold dear.

31:16.587 --> 31:19.156
Thank heavens that
potion was only temporary.

31:19.190 --> 31:22.026
The scruff is so much more
attractive than the timber.

31:24.328 --> 31:26.630
I'm here for my friend.

31:26.664 --> 31:28.330
So, the savior found us, did she?

31:28.799 --> 31:29.733
Now leave.

31:29.767 --> 31:31.802
Aah!

31:33.037 --> 31:34.671
Nice one, mom.

31:34.705 --> 31:36.506
Well, first thing you
learn as a bandit...

31:36.541 --> 31:37.808
back door's usually unlocked.

31:38.910 --> 31:40.709
August, are you okay?

31:40.744 --> 31:42.878
- Did they hurt you?
- I'll survive.

31:45.515 --> 31:46.816
Oh.

31:46.850 --> 31:48.761
Well, I see somebody's been practicing.

31:48.761 --> 31:51.921
Well, I seem to remember someone telling
me I just needed to believe in myself.

31:51.956 --> 31:53.522
I always knew you'd figure it out.

31:53.557 --> 31:56.058
It's good to have you back,

31:56.092 --> 31:58.561
even if it isn't the way
things were supposed to be.

31:58.595 --> 32:01.697
I'm glad I didn't have to
wait 20 years to see you

32:01.731 --> 32:02.865
as you again.

32:02.899 --> 32:05.734
Me too.

32:07.938 --> 32:09.338
Come on. Let's get you out of here.

32:09.372 --> 32:11.707
No one is going anywhere.

32:11.741 --> 32:13.741
Where the hell is Hook?
What'd you do to him?

32:13.776 --> 32:14.909
Sorry, sweetheart.

32:14.944 --> 32:16.778
Your boyfriend is shark bait.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.213
Aah! Oh!

32:18.247 --> 32:20.215
Drop those hands,

32:20.249 --> 32:23.718
or your mother here's
gonna need gills to breathe.

32:32.468 --> 32:34.202
I'm sorry, Ursula.

32:34.237 --> 32:35.403
But I had to.

32:35.437 --> 32:37.405
Don't you understand?

32:37.439 --> 32:41.409
My singing was the only thing
keeping mother's spirit alive,

32:41.443 --> 32:43.578
and now she's gone forever.

32:45.481 --> 32:47.415
You wanted me to choose a side.

32:47.449 --> 32:49.450
Well, father, I'm
choosing one... mine!

32:49.485 --> 32:51.218
Ursula, don't!

32:51.253 --> 32:52.286
All you ever wanted

32:52.320 --> 32:54.455
was for me to remain
your precious, little mermaid.

32:54.490 --> 32:56.457
Well, I'm not gonna be that anymore.

32:56.492 --> 32:59.126
In fact, I'm not gonna
be a mermaid at all.

32:59.160 --> 33:02.463
You named me Ursula
after the sea goddess of old.

33:02.498 --> 33:05.366
Legend says she was
strong and powerful.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.435
Well, that's exactly what I want to be.

33:08.469 --> 33:09.770
Ursula, wait!

33:21.749 --> 33:25.819
Now I'm even more powerful than you.

33:25.853 --> 33:30.223
And the whole sea will be at
the mercy of my every whim.

33:30.257 --> 33:33.259
You don't need to protect me, father.

33:33.294 --> 33:34.401
You need to fear me.

33:38.465 --> 33:41.401
Ursula, you don't need to do this.

33:41.435 --> 33:42.802
That's where you're wrong.

33:42.836 --> 33:44.470
I can't have him leave with you.

33:44.504 --> 33:46.439
Not when The Author is the only one

33:46.473 --> 33:47.974
who can give me what I want.

33:48.008 --> 33:50.376
That's not true.

33:51.478 --> 33:53.079
How are you still breathing?

33:53.113 --> 33:56.148
I'm good at surviving.
Or you're bad at killing.

33:56.182 --> 33:59.485
Either way, you don't need the
author to get what you want.

33:59.519 --> 34:03.789
I know why you couldn't release
your voice from that shell.

34:03.824 --> 34:07.159
Only the one who
enchanted it can do that.

34:07.193 --> 34:09.328
Wait.

34:09.362 --> 34:11.129
You don't mean...

34:11.164 --> 34:12.630
Aye.

34:12.665 --> 34:15.333
Father?

34:15.368 --> 34:17.436
Ursula.

34:20.340 --> 34:24.275
How are you here in this land?

34:24.310 --> 34:26.710
A young mermaid found me and
brought me through a portal.

34:26.745 --> 34:29.179
I need to say something.

34:29.214 --> 34:31.483
I'm sorry, Ursula.

34:31.516 --> 34:35.520
I never should have forced you
to use your voice as a weapon.

34:35.554 --> 34:39.389
It was just... Every
time I heard you sing,

34:39.424 --> 34:43.393
I heard your mother,
and it was too painful.

34:43.428 --> 34:47.498
I let that pain fuel
my desire for vengeance,

34:47.532 --> 34:49.533
but it shouldn't have.

34:49.567 --> 34:56.540
It should have reminded me that I
still had a piece of her... you.

34:58.343 --> 35:01.845
Let me return your voice

35:01.880 --> 35:05.549
so I can hear it one last time.

35:34.578 --> 35:39.415
Now that you are whole again,
I'll leave you in peace.

35:39.449 --> 35:41.417
Wait.

35:41.451 --> 35:45.888
My voice is all we have left of mother.

35:45.923 --> 35:48.457
You took it from me once.

35:48.491 --> 35:51.427
I don't want to do
the same thing to you.

35:51.461 --> 35:53.628
What are you saying?

35:53.663 --> 35:56.031
I've missed you.

35:57.567 --> 36:00.569
I've missed you, too.

36:06.809 --> 36:08.398
Where's Cruella?

36:08.626 --> 36:11.032
Uh, she must have slipped
away, most likely to warn Gold.

36:11.032 --> 36:12.919
We should clear out before they get back.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.278
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

36:21.958 --> 36:24.959
Hook, what's wrong?

36:24.993 --> 36:27.761
You gave Ursula everything she wanted.

36:27.796 --> 36:30.498
But I almost didn't, love.

36:30.532 --> 36:33.934
I was so desperate to figure
out what the Crocodile was up to,

36:33.969 --> 36:36.270
I almost became the man I used to be.

36:36.305 --> 36:38.272
You have no idea how easy it is

36:38.307 --> 36:40.273
to fall back into the darkness.

36:40.308 --> 36:44.578
Whatever mistakes you made
with Ursula, you fixed.

36:45.647 --> 36:47.514
Aye.

36:47.548 --> 36:50.283
But it's a stark reminder of something.

36:50.318 --> 36:52.185
What?

36:52.220 --> 36:57.190
With all this talk of
authors and the book,

36:57.225 --> 37:01.328
we've never discussed one fact...

37:01.362 --> 37:03.330
I was a villain.

37:03.364 --> 37:06.032
But you're not anymore.

37:06.066 --> 37:08.835
Neither is Regina, but she
still lost her happy ending.

37:08.869 --> 37:12.505
If we're to believe
the rules of the book,

37:12.539 --> 37:15.642
then it's only a matter
of time before I lose mine.

37:17.711 --> 37:18.645
Wait.

37:18.679 --> 37:20.880
If you're afraid of losing
your happy ending,

37:20.914 --> 37:22.481
that means you found it.

37:24.518 --> 37:25.985
What is it?

37:26.020 --> 37:29.321
Don't you know, Emma?

37:31.691 --> 37:34.092
It's you.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.380
Well, that was a royal waste of time.

37:55.414 --> 37:57.582
The door may not be in
the sorcerer's mansion,

37:57.616 --> 37:59.317
but it's somewhere in Storybrooke.

37:59.351 --> 38:00.886
We will find it.

38:08.727 --> 38:10.261
What are you doing here?

38:10.296 --> 38:12.197
Where's August?

38:12.231 --> 38:15.200
They rescued him... the heroes.

38:15.234 --> 38:17.202
You had one simple task.

38:17.236 --> 38:19.737
It wasn't my fault! We have a mole.

38:19.771 --> 38:22.506
Who would be foolish enough to cross us?

38:22.540 --> 38:25.309
I know exactly who.

38:26.712 --> 38:28.746
Ursula.

38:28.780 --> 38:31.615
She sold us out for a
reunion with daddy dearest.

38:31.649 --> 38:32.717
All right.

38:32.751 --> 38:34.618
We may have lost our informant,

38:34.652 --> 38:36.453
but we still have his information.

38:36.487 --> 38:38.255
Bring us the illustration of the door.

38:38.289 --> 38:40.591
Maybe there's something
in it the puppet missed.

38:46.964 --> 38:49.233
I suppose this is farewell.

38:49.267 --> 38:53.103
It is, but first, I have to
hold up my end of the deal.

38:58.275 --> 39:01.244
Gold's plan... I'm
afraid it involves Emma.

39:01.278 --> 39:02.278
She's the only way

39:02.312 --> 39:04.280
he can secure happy
endings for the villains.

39:04.314 --> 39:06.315
Well, I thought he
was gonna get The Author

39:06.350 --> 39:07.750
to rewrite everyone's stories.

39:07.784 --> 39:08.817
It's not that simple.

39:08.852 --> 39:11.820
The Author can't just
change things in this world

39:11.855 --> 39:14.590
because he didn't give everyone
their happy endings here.

39:16.293 --> 39:18.561
Emma did.

39:18.595 --> 39:19.729
She's the savior.

39:19.763 --> 39:22.331
And as long as there's a savior,

39:22.366 --> 39:26.334
The Author can't give the
villains what they really want.

39:26.369 --> 39:28.637
And the Dark One knows this.

39:28.671 --> 39:32.340
The Dark One's gonna try to kill Emma?

39:32.375 --> 39:33.375
Worse...

39:33.409 --> 39:38.781
he plans to fill her heart
with darkness forever.

39:47.823 --> 39:50.026
We're lucky he's okay.

39:50.639 --> 39:51.626
It wasn't luck.

39:51.661 --> 39:53.495
You got us that message. Thank you.

39:56.198 --> 39:57.985
I need your help with something.

39:58.126 --> 39:59.633
What is it?

39:59.668 --> 40:03.671
I had a dream today...
Robin Hood came back,

40:03.705 --> 40:07.608
we were finally together,
but then, I...

40:07.642 --> 40:10.278
The Evil Queen...

40:10.312 --> 40:14.615
showed up with a fireball in her hand.

40:14.649 --> 40:16.283
I may not be Archie, but it sounds like

40:16.318 --> 40:18.118
you're afraid of the
villain you used to be

40:18.152 --> 40:19.820
and the one you might become again.

40:19.854 --> 40:21.888
No, I don't think that's it.

40:21.923 --> 40:23.156
In my dream,

40:23.191 --> 40:26.893
I don't think the Evil Queen
was there to hurt Robin.

40:26.928 --> 40:29.663
I think she was there to protect him.

40:29.698 --> 40:30.997
From what?

40:31.032 --> 40:32.899
I don't know.

40:32.934 --> 40:36.837
I just... Felt it.

40:40.574 --> 40:45.812
You used to track people for a living.

40:45.847 --> 40:48.981
Can you get me
a phone number,

40:49.015 --> 40:51.884
a way to contact him, anything?

40:51.918 --> 40:52.852
Yeah.

40:52.886 --> 40:54.920
Yeah, I can do that.

40:54.955 --> 40:56.689
Mom!

41:06.233 --> 41:09.101
What is she doing here?

41:09.135 --> 41:11.170
Oh, it's okay. I promise.

41:12.705 --> 41:17.877
August... We need to talk about

41:17.911 --> 41:19.911
how I'm going to keep
up my cover with Gold.

41:21.414 --> 41:23.515
The only reason I was able to come here...

41:24.817 --> 41:27.853
is because they think
I'm stealing this page.

41:27.887 --> 41:31.055
We didn't find the door
at the sorcerer's mansion.

41:31.090 --> 41:33.392
That's because it's not there.

41:33.426 --> 41:35.761
What?

41:37.162 --> 41:40.365
But... You said you
didn't know where it was.

41:40.399 --> 41:42.433
And your nose didn't grow.

41:42.467 --> 41:46.070
My nose didn't grow
because I wasn't lying.

41:46.105 --> 41:50.541
When Gold asked me, I didn't
know where the door was

41:50.575 --> 41:55.112
because I didn't know where
Henry was keeping this page.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.854
Regina...

42:05.351 --> 42:07.273
This isn't just an illustration.

42:08.994 --> 42:12.261
This is the door.
