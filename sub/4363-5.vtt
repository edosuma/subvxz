WEBVTT

00:08.239 --> 00:10.381
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER EVEN
HAD THE URGE TO HAVE A BABY.

00:10.381 --> 00:14.785
THERE I WAS. I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT OLIVIA.

00:14.785 --> 00:17.188
YOU'RE WORRIED YOU'RE GONNA FALL
OFF THE WAGON IN THE FUTURE.

00:17.188 --> 00:19.690
IF YOU WANNA PREVENT YOUR FUTURE
AND SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE,

00:19.690 --> 00:22.453
FIRST STEP ISN'T KEEPING SECRETS
FROM YOUR WIFE.
REMEMBER THAT HACKER--
MR. CHEETO DUST?

00:22.453 --> 00:26.026
GIVE HIM A CALL.
IS SOMALIA
REALLY THAT IMPORTANT?

00:26.026 --> 00:29.500
YEAH.
(Mark) WE'VE BEEN SO WORRIED
THE BLACKOUT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN,

00:29.500 --> 00:31.031
WE HAVEN'T STOPPED TO ASK
OURSELVES,

00:31.031 --> 00:33.734
WHAT IF IT HAPPENED BEFORE?

00:40.611 --> 00:42.273
ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL,

00:42.273 --> 00:45.276
YEAH, IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD

00:45.276 --> 00:47.518
IF I HAD--
FORGET IT, MARK. FORGET IT.

00:47.518 --> 00:49.520
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW

00:49.520 --> 00:53.124
THE DETAILS I DO REMEMBER,
I REMEMBER CLEARLY.

00:53.124 --> 00:55.826
FABULOUS. LOOK,
JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

00:55.826 --> 00:59.059
YOU TELL ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS,
WE ARE D.O.A.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.732
(vehicle approaches,
shifts gears)

01:07.438 --> 01:10.441
HEY. JUST WANTED TO SHARE
SOME GOOD NEWS WITH YOU.

01:10.441 --> 01:13.174
WELL, THE WHOLE TRIP'S BEEN
A BIT OF A DISASTER.

01:13.174 --> 01:16.177
BUT WEDECK PULLED
SOME KIND OF RABBIT.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.110
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE HE WOULDN'T HAVE--
(tires screeching)

01:19.110 --> 01:21.552
(loud crash)

01:21.552 --> 01:23.154
(tires peal)

01:29.520 --> 01:31.292
(Demetri and Vreede) NO! NO!

01:33.194 --> 01:46.207
(loud explosion)

01:46.207 --> 01:50.411
(Vreede) DRAGGING US DOWN HERE
EARLY IN THE MORNING LIKE THIS.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.144
IF YOU ASK ME, THIS WHOLE THING
IS ONE BIG CHINESE FIRE DRILL.

01:53.144 --> 01:56.187
HEY!
IS THAT INAPPROPRIATE
FOR THE WORKPLACE?

01:56.187 --> 01:57.888
OH, NO, NO. THAT'S COOL.

01:57.888 --> 02:00.521
I KNOW HOW
YOU OLD PEOPLE ARE.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.353
(door opens)
(chuckles)

02:02.353 --> 02:05.526
DEMETRI FORDIS NOH?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME FOR?

02:05.526 --> 02:08.199
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
I TOLD YOU IN MY AFFIDAVIT, MAN.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.801
DOESN'T YOU MEAN YOU WERE
TELLING THE TRUTH

02:10.801 --> 02:14.865
WHEN YOU GAVE IT.

02:14.865 --> 02:17.768
(door closes)

02:24.845 --> 02:28.619
(heart beating)

02:28.619 --> 02:30.851
I WAS ALONE.

02:30.851 --> 02:34.825
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS
ANYONE ELSE IN THE BUILDING.

02:34.825 --> 02:38.689
(Vreede) I DIDN'T THINK
ANYONE ELSE WAS IN THE BUILDING.

02:38.689 --> 02:41.762
IT WAS LATE. 10:00 P.M.

02:43.434 --> 02:45.336
(beeping)

02:45.336 --> 02:47.538
I WAS WORKING IN MY OFFICE.

02:47.538 --> 02:49.700
I WAS WORKING LATE.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.703
I WAS...
LEAVING FOR THE NIGHT.

02:52.703 --> 02:55.206
(whoosh)
(Vreede) I WAS HEADED OUT
THE SECURITY EXIT.

02:55.206 --> 02:57.778
(beeps twice, door unlocks)

02:57.778 --> 03:00.851
I DON'T KNOW WHY. MAYBE...
BECAUSE IT WAS LATE.
(whoosh)

03:00.851 --> 03:03.584
DID YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE
DURING YOUR FLASH-FORWARD?

03:03.584 --> 03:05.216
NO.

03:05.216 --> 03:07.788
YES. I SAW TWO MEN,

03:07.788 --> 03:11.562
BOTH WEARING MASKS,
BOTH CARRYING KALASHNIKOVS.

03:11.562 --> 03:13.224
(beeping)

03:13.224 --> 03:15.526
DID YOU RECOGNIZE THE MEN?

03:15.526 --> 03:18.869
I DID MENTION THEY WERE
WEARING MASKS, RIGHT?

03:20.831 --> 03:22.833
HOW'S IT GOING OVER THERE?

03:22.833 --> 03:25.936
(Aaron) How's it going
in D.C.?
WELL, THEY DON'T THINK
I'M A TRAITOR.

03:25.936 --> 03:28.239
THOSE LIE DETECTORS
CAN BE FOOLED, RIGHT?

03:28.239 --> 03:30.841
(chuckles) SERIOUSLY,
HOW'S IT GOING OVER THERE?
WELL, I'VE JUST ABOUT
FIGURED OUT

03:30.841 --> 03:33.944
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR ALARM SYSTEM.

03:33.944 --> 03:36.917
And you're welcome.
I fixed that hack repair job

03:36.917 --> 03:39.920
that you did
on your garage door.
AH, YOU'RE
A FULL-SERVICE SPONSOR.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.523
YEAH, AND CHARLIE NOW KNOWS
HOW TO DRIVE A STICK.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.525
So now that you're
off the hot seat,

03:44.525 --> 03:46.527
when can we expect
to see you back?

03:46.527 --> 03:47.858
WEDECK'S TESTIFYING
IN THESE HEARINGS.

03:47.858 --> 03:50.431
UH, I'M GONNA HELP DEMETRI
WITH DOCUMENT SUPPORT.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.464
SOUNDS EXCITING.
Mm, I'm the one
who started the office

03:53.464 --> 03:54.965
ON THIS MOSAIC PATH,

03:54.965 --> 03:57.408
AND I'M FEELING A WHOLE LOT OF
PRESSURE TO BE RIGHT ABOUT IT.

03:57.408 --> 03:59.910
D.C.'s GOT A.A. MEETINGS,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

03:59.910 --> 04:02.913
MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA
TO GO AND FIND ONE.

04:02.913 --> 04:04.775
(dog barking in distance)

04:04.775 --> 04:06.777
I'LL TAKE IT
UNDER ADVISEMENT.

04:06.777 --> 04:08.779
IN THE MEANTIME,
SEE IF YOU CAN'T

04:08.779 --> 04:10.981
GET CHARLIE INTO A FEW COLLEGES
WHILE I'M GONE.

04:10.981 --> 04:14.425
GO TO A MEETING.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.460
VERY CLOAK-AND-DAGGER.
JUST LIKE THE MOVIES.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.462
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF ANYWAY?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.334
EVIDENCE.

04:23.334 --> 04:25.836
WEDECK THINKS HE NEEDS IT
FOR HIS SENATE TESTIMONY.

04:25.836 --> 04:27.968
HE'S AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE AWAY OUR FUNDING,

04:27.968 --> 04:30.541
I WHICH CASE MOSAIC
IS DEAD IN THE WATER.

04:30.541 --> 04:33.874
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN WEDECK
WITH A STICK SO FAR UP HIS ASS.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.946
YEAH, HE HATES D.C.
HE USED TO LIVE HERE.

04:35.946 --> 04:38.709
APPARENTLY IT LEFT
A BAD TASTE IN HIS MOUTH.

04:38.709 --> 04:41.051
YOU ASK ME, HE'S A DUDE
WITH SOMETHING TO PROVE.

04:50.661 --> 04:51.992
(panting)

04:51.992 --> 04:54.695
WHOO! YOU'RE GETTIN' BETTER.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.368
NO. YOU'RE GETTIN' OLDER.
(chuckles)

04:57.368 --> 04:58.969
(groans)

04:58.969 --> 05:00.871
OH!
(pants)

05:00.871 --> 05:02.873
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU, TOO.

05:02.873 --> 05:06.677
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, STAN.
WHO SAID THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE HEARINGS

05:06.677 --> 05:08.379
WEREN'T GOOD FOR ANYTHING?

05:08.379 --> 05:10.541
I SAY IT ON A DAILY BASIS.

05:10.541 --> 05:12.883
LOOK, DAVE,

05:12.883 --> 05:14.845
THESE HEARINGS...
RELAX.

05:14.845 --> 05:18.048
THIS IS CONGRESS MASTURBATING
TO THE SOUND OF ITS OWN VOICE.

05:18.048 --> 05:20.421
REALLY?
'CAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS

05:20.421 --> 05:22.823
THESE HEARINGS ARE GONNA
REDISTRIBUTE A LOT OF FUNDING.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.825
AND FUNDING IS WHAT I NEED.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.428
STAN, NOBODY'S GONNA
TAKE ANYTHING FROM YOU.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.000
LOOK, OUR MOSAIC INVESTIGATION'S
ALREADY PAYING OFF.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.403
WE'RE STARTING TO GET
A REAL PICTURE OF APRIL 29th

05:32.403 --> 05:34.435
AND WHAT CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.036
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE MONEY.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.869
AND IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO HAVE A BIG DOG ON MY SIDE.

05:38.869 --> 05:41.572
OH, YOU DON'T WANT ME
AS YOUR FRIEND.

05:41.572 --> 05:44.945
WHY?
CLEMENTE'S CHAIRING
THESE HEARINGS. YOU REMEMBER?

05:46.777 --> 05:48.879
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

05:48.879 --> 05:51.982
YOU THINK I'D EVEN
SET FOOT IN D.C. IF I DID?

05:53.524 --> 05:55.355
ALL RIGHT, I WOULD'VE,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.928
BECAUSE THIS IS
THAT IMPORTANT, DAVE.

05:57.928 --> 06:00.691
(chuckles)
WHAT?

06:00.691 --> 06:02.963
NO, IT'S JUST THAT THE--

06:02.963 --> 06:05.836
THE TRUSTY BOY SCOUT
IS FUNNY

06:05.836 --> 06:07.638
COMING FROM YOU.

06:07.638 --> 06:08.799
HUH.

06:08.799 --> 06:10.771
YOU WOULD KNOW.
(dribbles basketball)

06:10.771 --> 06:11.902
MM! (grunts)
AH!

06:11.902 --> 06:14.405
(grunts)
(chuckles)

06:18.949 --> 06:21.452
(shouts indistinctly)
AH!

06:21.452 --> 06:24.555
(both grunting)

06:28.919 --> 06:29.920
UHH!

06:31.962 --> 06:35.065
(shouts)

06:35.065 --> 06:37.628
ALL RIGHT.

06:46.036 --> 06:48.939
HEY. THAT WAS A PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE MOVE BACK THERE.

06:48.939 --> 06:51.582
I MEAN, YOU ALMOST
KNOCKED THE WIND OUT OF ME.

06:51.582 --> 06:53.584
OH, I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU OKAY?

06:53.584 --> 06:56.647
YEAH. YOU KNOW, NO PROBLEM. UM,
SO "ENTER THE DRAGON'S" PLAYING

06:56.647 --> 06:58.589
AT THE--THE NUART TONIGHT.

06:58.589 --> 07:01.151
I-I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
CHECK IT OUT.
OH. SORRY.

07:01.151 --> 07:03.754
I ALREADY HAVE PLANS
TONIGHT.

07:03.754 --> 07:06.827
OH. OKAY.
UH, MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.599
YEAH.

07:08.599 --> 07:09.930
MAYBE. YEAH.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.133
YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
I'LL CATCH YOU GUYS LATER.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.665
BYE.

07:14.665 --> 07:16.006
BYE. BYE.

07:17.508 --> 07:19.470
WHAT A MANGINA.

07:21.912 --> 07:24.575
(beep)
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

07:24.575 --> 07:26.717
UH, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
DOES HE HAVE A BROTHER?

07:26.717 --> 07:28.719
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M STILL WADING IN.

07:28.719 --> 07:29.980
GOOD MORNING.

07:29.980 --> 07:33.053
HERE YOU GO, PRINCESS--
YOU'RE VERY OWN HAYSTACK.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.655
WHAT IS THIS?

07:34.655 --> 07:36.657
18 YEARS WORTH OF SATELLITE
IMAGERY FROM SOUTHERN SOMALIA,

07:36.657 --> 07:38.659
COURTESY OF
THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.831
OH, I THOUGHT YOU AND MARK
GOT SHUT DOWN ON THAT.

07:40.831 --> 07:43.564
WE GOT UNSHUT.
OH.
UPLOAD WHATEVER'S ON HERE,

07:43.564 --> 07:46.767
AND WE'LL START
POURING THROUGH IT.
POURING THROUGH IT FOR WHAT?

07:46.767 --> 07:50.140
ANYTHING THAT RELATES
TO THE CROW DIE-OFF IN '91,

07:50.140 --> 07:52.142
ESPECIALLY IF WE CAN
SUBSTANTIATE REPORTS

07:52.142 --> 07:55.075
THAT PEOPLE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
IN THE GANWAR REGION

07:55.075 --> 07:57.678
DURING THAT TIME.
BONUS POINTS
IF WE CAN FIND SOMETHING

07:57.678 --> 08:00.050
THAT GIVES WEDECK EXTRA AMMO
IN WASHINGTON.

08:00.050 --> 08:03.714
ANYTHING TO KEEP OUR HAPPY
INVESTIGATION GOING? I'M ON IT.
(chuckles)

08:06.216 --> 08:08.088
(indistinct conversations)

08:08.088 --> 08:10.060
WHERE'S BENFORD?
BACK AT THE HOTEL.

08:10.060 --> 08:13.223
(cell phone beeping)
HE SAID PHOTO OPS
MAKE HIM CONSTIPATED.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.225
TELL HIM TO GET IN LINE.

08:15.225 --> 08:18.268
(chuckles)
I WISH MY FIFTH GRADE TEACHER
COULD SEE ME NOW.

08:18.268 --> 08:21.602
ALWAYS SAID I WOULD EITHER
END UP DEAD OR IN PRISON.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.604
THERE'S STILL TIME,
MY FRIEND.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.975
STILL TIME.

08:24.975 --> 08:29.139
(indistinct conversations)

08:29.139 --> 08:31.682
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE PRESS,

08:31.682 --> 08:33.744
THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE
A BRIEF STATEMENT.

08:33.744 --> 08:35.916
AT THE CONCLUSION
OF THE STATEMENT,

08:35.916 --> 08:37.988
THE PRESIDENT WILL ANSWER
A LIMITED NUMBER OF QUESTIONS.

08:37.988 --> 08:40.591
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

08:40.591 --> 08:43.554
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
GOOD AFTERNOON,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.656
PLEASE.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.928
(reporters shouting at once)

08:47.928 --> 08:49.860
BE SEATED.

08:49.860 --> 08:52.833
(camera shutters clicking)

09:03.013 --> 09:05.215
SO IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY
THE SENATE HEARINGS WERE CLOSED,

09:05.215 --> 09:07.547
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK A SENATOR.
BUT I'M WILLING TO WAGER

09:07.547 --> 09:09.980
IT'S BECAUSE NATIONAL SECURITY
ISSUES WILL BE DISCUSSED.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.982
NEXT QUESTION.
(reporters) MR. PRESIDENT.

09:11.982 --> 09:13.684
SCOTT.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.686
MR. PRESIDENT,
THREE WEEKS SINCE THE BLACKOUT,

09:15.686 --> 09:17.858
THERE'S STILL
NO CENTRALIZED AGENCY

09:17.858 --> 09:19.890
TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.032
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO CRITICS
WHO SAY THAT YOUR ADMINISTRATION

09:22.032 --> 09:24.134
HASN'T LEARNED FROM THE LESSONS
OF 9/11 AND KATRINA?

09:24.134 --> 09:26.136
WELL, TODAY'S HEARINGS
HAVE BEEN CONVENED

09:26.136 --> 09:28.699
TO ADDRESS JUST THIS ISSUE.

09:28.699 --> 09:30.601
WE'RE COORDINATING
OUR RESPONSES,

09:30.601 --> 09:34.274
WE'RE REDIRECTING FUNDS
TO THE MOST PROMISING LEADS,

09:34.274 --> 09:35.976
AND WE'RE DROPPING
INVESTIGATIONS

09:35.976 --> 09:39.009
WHICH ARE NOT
PRODUCING RESULTS.

09:39.009 --> 09:41.051
WHEN I FINALIZE
MY VICE PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE,

09:41.051 --> 09:44.855
HE OR SHE WILL SUPERVISE
THESE EFFORTS.

09:44.855 --> 09:46.657
THANK YOU, ALL.
(man) THANKS, EVERYONE.

09:46.657 --> 09:51.021
WHY HAVEN'T YOU SHARED WHAT YOU
SAW IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD,

09:51.021 --> 09:52.362
MR. PRESIDENT?

09:52.362 --> 09:53.964
(camera shutter clicking)
MR. OBREGON,

09:53.964 --> 09:57.698
LIKE MANY OTHER WORLD LEADERS,

09:57.698 --> 10:00.370
I'M FOLLOWING THE POLICY
OF NOT REVEALING WHAT I SAW.

10:00.370 --> 10:01.902
(whoosh)

10:01.902 --> 10:03.904
MR. PRESIDENT?

10:03.904 --> 10:07.077
SIR, SOMETHING
TERRIBLE'S HAPPENED.

10:07.077 --> 10:08.608
(whoosh)

10:08.608 --> 10:11.682
I'M THINKING ABOUT THE PRESENT,
NOT THE FUTURE, OSCAR.

10:11.682 --> 10:13.944
WE HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO.
THANK YOU, ALL.

10:13.944 --> 10:17.347
(reporters shouting at once)

10:17.347 --> 10:19.349
(indistinct conversations)

10:19.349 --> 10:20.921
MR. WEDECK?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.753
PLEASE FOLLOW ME.

10:25.896 --> 10:28.098
(Aaron) OKAY, ALL I NEED
IS A NEW CODE.

10:28.098 --> 10:30.931
UH, 0-3-1-2.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.402
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

10:32.402 --> 10:35.105
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO PICK SOMETHING

10:35.105 --> 10:36.236
THAT MARK WILL REMEMBER?

10:36.236 --> 10:37.838
(both chuckle)

10:37.838 --> 10:41.011
HOW'S IT GOING IN WASHINGTON?
UH, NOT GREAT. MARK CALLED.

10:41.011 --> 10:44.244
HE SOUNDS STRESSED.
I'M SURE HE'LL DO FINE.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.679
YOU DON'T SEEM TOO SURE.

10:48.679 --> 10:51.682
I DON'T KNOW. THIS CASE
HAS HIM TRAVELING A LOT,

10:51.682 --> 10:56.026
AND HE'S AWAY FROM HOME,
HIS SUPPORT SYSTEM. YOU KNOW...

10:56.026 --> 10:58.028
SO I OVERHEARD
YOU BOTH TALKING

10:58.028 --> 11:00.230
ABOUT HIM GOING TO MEETINGS
IN WASHINGTON.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.765
IS HE HAVING A HARD TIME?

11:04.765 --> 11:07.738
IT'S JUST
A FRIENDLY REMINDER.

11:07.738 --> 11:10.741
IT'S JUST THAT THE LAST TIME
MARK HAD A PROBLEM,

11:10.741 --> 11:13.373
HE WAS AWAY FROM HOME,
TESTIFYING IN ONE OF HIS CASES.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.375
HE'D JUST BEEN PROMOTED
AT WORK.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.948
THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

11:17.948 --> 11:20.450
I THINK IT'S EXACTLY
THE SAME.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.382
AND EVEN IF WEREN'T--

11:22.382 --> 11:25.415
LOOK, I GET IT.

11:25.415 --> 11:28.759
THINGS HAVE BEEN STRESSFUL
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

11:28.759 --> 11:31.421
I GUESS MARK TOLD YOU
ABOUT MY FLASH-FORWARD?

11:31.421 --> 11:35.025
MM.

11:35.025 --> 11:36.696
OF COURSE.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.102
EH, HE'S JUST FIXATED NOW
ON THE IDEA

11:42.102 --> 11:43.774
THAT IN SIX MONTHS' TIME,

11:43.774 --> 11:46.006
I'M GONNA BE SLEEPING
WITH ANOTHER MAN--

11:46.006 --> 11:48.008
WHICH IS INSANE.
BUT HIS WHOLE JOB

11:48.008 --> 11:50.811
DEPENDS ON THESE FLASH-FORWARDS
COMING TRUE, SO--

11:50.811 --> 11:52.282
MARK'S AN ALCOHOLIC,
OLIVIA.

11:52.282 --> 11:54.714
HE DOESN'T NEED
A REASON TO DRINK.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.117
HE DRINKS BECAUSE HE DRINKS.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.090
I KNOW.

12:00.090 --> 12:03.493
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME WHETHER I
THINK HE'S GONNA TAKE A DRINK--

12:03.493 --> 12:05.025
I AM.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.460
ARE YOU ASKING FOR HIM
OR FOR YOU?

12:10.460 --> 12:12.132
I DON'T KNOW.

12:15.866 --> 12:19.209
I LOVE HIM, AARON.
I JUST...

12:19.209 --> 12:21.211
I KNOW I CAN'T CONTROL HIM.

12:21.211 --> 12:23.743
THAT'S THE HARDEST PART
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.016
TRUST ALWAYS IS
WITH AN ALCOHOLIC.

12:26.016 --> 12:29.850
BUT IF YOU CAN'T
TRUST MARK,

12:29.850 --> 12:32.252
WHO CAN YOU TRUST?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.025
(door closes)

12:35.025 --> 12:36.526
LET ME GUESS.

12:36.526 --> 12:38.528
YOU REMEMBERED YOU OWE ME

12:38.528 --> 12:41.031
AND HAD A CHANGE OF HEART
ABOUT HELPING ME OUT.

12:41.031 --> 12:45.035
STAN... WE'RE NOT
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ANYMORE.

12:45.035 --> 12:48.068
AND INSIDE THE BELTWAY,
WELL...

12:48.068 --> 12:51.401
YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE SUBTLER
ABOUT CALLING IN OUR CHITS.

12:51.401 --> 12:54.004
I GOT OUT OF THE BELTWAY,
IF YOU RECALL.

12:54.004 --> 12:56.376
YEAH.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.079
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT ME OWING YOU ONE,

12:59.079 --> 13:01.551
AND YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT ME HELPING YOU OUT.

13:01.551 --> 13:05.956
BUT MY PLAN IS GONNA BRING YOU
RIGHT BACK IN THE BELTWAY.

13:05.956 --> 13:07.958
I ALWAYS FELT REALLY BAD

13:07.958 --> 13:10.360
THAT I COULDN'T
BRING YOU ON BOARD INITIALLY.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.362
IT'S FINE.
EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.

13:12.362 --> 13:18.068
YOU KNOW, THE CHINESE
VIEW CHAOS AS OPPORTUNITY,

13:18.068 --> 13:22.232
AND THE BLACKOUT GIVES ME
THE CHANCE TO PAY YOU BACK.

13:24.134 --> 13:27.007
DIRECTOR OF HOMELAND SECURITY,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.209
MEMBER OF MY CABINET.

13:35.145 --> 13:37.547
I'M PRETTY SURE

13:37.547 --> 13:39.990
CLEMENTE WILL BLOCK
MY APPOINTMENT.

13:39.990 --> 13:42.953
CLEMENTE'S GOT BIGGER FISH
TO FRY.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.227
THINK ABOUT IT.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.559
THERE'S NO RUSH.

13:57.267 --> 13:59.509
(laughs) THIS IS, LIKE,
THE SIXTH COURSE.

13:59.509 --> 14:02.042
WHAT ARE YOU, A FOOD CRITIC
OR SOMETHING?

14:02.042 --> 14:05.015
CHEF, ACTUALLY.
THIS IS MY RESTAURANT.

14:05.015 --> 14:07.347
WELL, THE ONE WHERE I WORK.
MM.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.620
YOUR BEING FBI,
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE NOT...

14:10.620 --> 14:12.152
OH. OUT?

14:12.152 --> 14:14.024
(chuckles) NO.

14:14.024 --> 14:16.326
I WORK FOR
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

14:16.326 --> 14:20.160
AND "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL"
IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE.
WHO KNOWS?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.392
MAYBE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW
WE'LL ALL BE MORE ENLIGHTENED.

14:22.392 --> 14:26.266
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I'M HERE IN THE RESTAURANT,

14:26.266 --> 14:28.969
BUT I HAVE A WEDDING BAND
ON MY FINGER.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.042
(laughs)
THAT WAS WAY TOO MUCH
INFORMATION,

14:32.042 --> 14:35.005
ESPECIALLY FOR A FIRST DATE.
NO. NO, NO, NO.

14:35.005 --> 14:39.349
MAYBE IT'S A SIGN
OF HOW WELL THIS IS GOING.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.351
HELP ME CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

14:41.351 --> 14:43.453
WHAT DID YOU SEE
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD?

14:43.453 --> 14:47.357
WELL, I WAS...

14:47.357 --> 14:49.189
ON THE INTERNATIONAL
SPACE STATION

14:49.189 --> 14:52.662
HAVING A 3-WAY WITH
HILLARY CLINTON AND SARAH PALIN.

14:52.662 --> 14:56.396
REALLY? ACTUALLY, DID I SAY
I WAS IN THE RESTAURANT?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.928
MM-HMM.

14:57.928 --> 15:00.170
I MEANT I WAS ON "WHO WANTS
TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?"

15:00.170 --> 15:02.032
AND ANGELINA JOLIE
WAS THE GAME SHOW HOST.

15:02.032 --> 15:04.404
OH.YOU SLUT.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.077
YEAH, ANGIE JUST ASKED ME
THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION.

15:07.077 --> 15:10.440
I WENT TO PHONE A FRIEND--
YOU--BUT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.682
SO MY "MILLIONAIRE" MOMENT
WAS GONE.

15:12.682 --> 15:15.515
WELL, I DON'T BUY THAT.

15:15.515 --> 15:20.120
WHAT, THAT ANGELINA JOLIE
WOULD BE A GAME SHOW HOST?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.352
NO.

15:22.352 --> 15:24.995
THAT I WOULD EVER
LET YOU DOWN LIKE THAT.

15:45.275 --> 15:48.948
SENATOR CLEMENTE AND OTHER
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE,

15:48.948 --> 15:51.281
THE C.D.C. HAS RULED OUT
PSYCHOTROPIC PHARMACEUTICALS

15:51.281 --> 15:53.283
IN THE GLOBAL WATER SUPPLY

15:53.283 --> 15:56.156
AS THE POTENTIAL CAUSE
OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS SHIFT.

15:56.156 --> 16:01.091
AN ALIEN INTELLIGENCE MAY HAVE
BEEN AT WORK HERE, YES.

16:01.091 --> 16:02.092
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING.

16:02.092 --> 16:04.294
CHINA.

16:04.294 --> 16:06.536
CAN YOU ELABORATE,
DIRECTOR KELLER?

16:06.536 --> 16:09.439
CHINA'S POPULATION
NUMBERS 1.3 BILLION,

16:09.439 --> 16:12.102
YET THEY SUFFERED FATALITIES
OF LESS THAN HALF A PERCENT

16:12.102 --> 16:13.603
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

16:13.603 --> 16:16.646
NO MYSTERY.
WHEN THE BLACKOUT HAPPENED,

16:16.646 --> 16:19.549
IT WAS 2:00 IN THE MORNING OVER
THERE. EVERYBODY WAS ASLEEP.

16:19.549 --> 16:22.552
THAT DOESN'T STRIKE YOU
AS A BIT CONVENIENT?

16:22.552 --> 16:25.055
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY UNTOUCHED,
WHILE AMERICA SUFFERS

16:25.055 --> 16:28.018
THE GREATEST NUMBER
OF CAUSALITIES PER CAPITA

16:28.018 --> 16:30.160
OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.363
IT IS THE CIA's BELIEF
THAT THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

16:33.363 --> 16:35.725
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS
A TARGETED EVENT

16:35.725 --> 16:38.228
DESIGNED TO BRING ABOUT
THE COLLAPSE OF OUR GOVERNMENT.

16:40.470 --> 16:42.672
LET'S TAKE A SHORT RECESS.

16:42.672 --> 16:44.704
THEN WE'LL HEAR
FROM STANFORD WEDECK,

16:44.704 --> 16:48.038
FIELD DIRECTOR OF
THE FBI's LOS ANGELES OFFICE.

16:48.038 --> 16:50.040
AGENT WEDECK
IS CURRENTLY RUNNING

16:50.040 --> 16:52.142
AN INTERESTING INVESTIGATION

16:52.142 --> 16:54.013
THAT HAS DIVERGED SIGNIFICANTLY

16:54.013 --> 16:57.187
FROM THE METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED
BY THE REST OF THE BUREAU.

17:01.091 --> 17:04.023
NOW I REMEMBER
WHAT I HATE ABOUT D.C.,

17:04.023 --> 17:05.525
WHAT THIS PLACE TURNS ME INTO.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.027
(Felicia) You hold your head
high, Stanford Wedeck.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.729
You're a good man.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.433
ENJOYING D.C., STANFORD?

17:13.433 --> 17:15.435
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CALL YOU BACK.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.167
(shuts cell phone)
JOYCE.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.169
SENATOR, ACTUALLY.

17:19.169 --> 17:22.612
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU
YOU'RE A SORE LOSER, JOYCE?

17:22.612 --> 17:24.274
(scoffs) LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

17:24.274 --> 17:26.776
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GOT PUT OUT TO PASTURE.

17:26.776 --> 17:30.080
SPEAKING OF WHICH... (sighs)
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT,

17:30.080 --> 17:32.452
KNOWING WHAT YOU DID
WITH THAT WOMAN?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.724
DOES YOUR WIFE KNOW?

17:34.724 --> 17:38.128
IF I COULD'VE PROVED
WHAT YOU DID SIX YEARS AGO,

17:38.128 --> 17:41.131
I WOULD BE SITTING BEHIND
THE DESK IN THE OVAL OFFICE

17:41.131 --> 17:42.632
RIGHT NOW.

17:42.632 --> 17:45.135
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

17:45.135 --> 17:47.637
I DOUBT YOU WOULD'VE GOTTEN
A SECOND TERM.

17:49.139 --> 17:51.641
"IF YOU SIT BY THE RIVER
LONG ENOUGH,

17:51.641 --> 17:53.843
YOU'LL SEE THE BODIES
OF YOUR ENEMIES FLOAT BY."

17:53.843 --> 17:55.575
SUN TZU.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.577
GET READY TO FLOAT,
STANFORD.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.850
YOU WANNA GO AFTER ME?
YOU GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

18:00.850 --> 18:03.353
BUT MOSAIC--
IS A JOKE.

18:03.353 --> 18:05.815
NOT EVERYONE'S VISIONS
ARE GOING TO COME TRUE.

18:05.815 --> 18:08.458
MOST PEOPLE DON'T AGREE.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.690
MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE
WHAT I DID.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.763
I SAW MYSELF AS PRESIDENT
IN SIX MONTHS.

18:16.766 --> 18:21.301
NOW AS IMPOSSIBLE
AS THAT MAY BE...

18:21.301 --> 18:24.374
IT'S A NICE THOUGHT,
ISN'T IT?

18:30.880 --> 18:34.184
HOW MUCH OF THAT
DID YOU HEAR?

18:34.184 --> 18:35.815
ENOUGH TO KNOW

18:35.815 --> 18:38.818
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE GUY
IN JOYCE CLEMENTE'S GUN SIGHTS.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.820
NO, YOU DON'T.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.693
WHILE OTHERS ARE USING
WHAT THEY KNOW OF THE PRESENT

18:43.693 --> 18:45.195
TO EXPLAIN THE BLACKOUT,

18:45.195 --> 18:47.697
OUR OFFICE IS TRYING
TO CONSOLIDATE INFORMATION

18:47.697 --> 18:51.130
GLEANED FROM
THE FLASH-FORWARDS THEMSELVES.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.132
THE MOSAIC COLLECTIVE
HAS GATHERED THE VISIONS

18:53.132 --> 18:54.834
OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF AVERAGE PEOPLE

18:54.834 --> 18:56.836
ALL AROUND THE WORLD,

18:56.836 --> 18:58.838
LETTING OUR OFFICE
CONSTRUCT A PICTURE

18:58.838 --> 19:01.871
OF WHAT THE WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE
ON APRIL 29th, 2010.

19:01.871 --> 19:03.873
A TACT, I BELIEVE,
YOU'VE TAKEN

19:03.873 --> 19:07.177
WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL
OR PROPER AUTHORIZATION.

19:07.177 --> 19:09.719
IT'S GOTTEN RESULTS.
YES, I FORGOT.

19:09.719 --> 19:11.921
YOU'RE AN "ENDS JUSTIFY MEANS"
KIND OF GUY,

19:11.921 --> 19:15.285
NO MATTER HOW QUESTIONABLE
THOSE MEANS MAY BE.

19:15.285 --> 19:17.857
IN THIS CASE,
THE "MEANS" MERELY INVOLVE

19:17.857 --> 19:19.859
USING THE FUTURE WE'VE SEEN

19:19.859 --> 19:22.862
TO GUIDE OUR INVESTIGATION
OF THE BLACKOUT.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.195
HOW EXACTLY?

19:25.195 --> 19:27.197
ONE OF OUR AGENTS HAD
A FLASH-FORWARD OF HIMSELF

19:27.197 --> 19:29.499
INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE
OF THE BLACKOUT.

19:29.499 --> 19:32.342
HE REMEMBERS LEADS
AND INVESTIGATORY PATHS

19:32.342 --> 19:34.344
THAT WE WON'T HAVE
FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS.

19:34.344 --> 19:39.549
THOSE LEADS HAVE ALREADY LEAD TO
SIGNIFICANT BREAKS IN THE CASE.

19:39.549 --> 19:41.711
"SIGNIFICANT" MIGHT BE
OVERSTATING THINGS A LITTLE,

19:41.711 --> 19:43.182
AGENT WEDECK.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.885
STILL, IF YOUR ENTIRE
INVESTIGATION IS BOTTOMED

19:45.885 --> 19:48.358
ON WHAT THIS ONE AGENT SAW...

19:48.358 --> 19:50.920
PERHAPS WE SHOULD HEAR
FROM HIM.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.892
I'M THE DEPUTY FIELD DIRECTOR,
MADAME CHAIRMAN.

19:52.892 --> 19:56.926
YES, YOU SEEM TO HAVE LANDED
ON YOUR FEET QUITE NICELY,

19:56.926 --> 20:00.500
MR. WEDECK.
THE POINT BEING, I'M THE ONE
HEADING UP THE INVESTIGATION.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.203
BUT IN ANY CASE, AGENT BENFORD'S
ALREADY BEEN THOROUGHLY VETTED,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.336
INCLUDING SUBMITTING
TO A POLYGRAPH.

20:06.336 --> 20:07.837
IN THAT CASE,

20:07.837 --> 20:10.880
HE WON'T MIND SUBMITTING
TO SOME QUESTIONS FROM US.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.213
THIS HEARING RECONVENES TOMORROW
AT 10:00 A.M.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.287
WITH AGENT BENFORD'S
TESTIMONY.

20:17.287 --> 20:20.720
(gallery murmuring)

20:22.792 --> 20:24.694
JUST TELL THE TRUTH, MARK.

20:24.694 --> 20:27.457
IT'S GOTTEN US THIS FAR.

20:36.436 --> 20:40.340
(woman) â™ª IT'S WHAT'S CALLED
A SITUATION â™ª

20:40.340 --> 20:42.512
â™ªâ™ª

20:42.512 --> 20:45.745
â™ª CIRCUMSTANTIAL... â™ª

20:45.745 --> 20:48.948
HERE. LET A PROFESSIONAL
DO THAT.

20:48.948 --> 20:49.919
(chuckles)

20:49.919 --> 20:51.451
THANK YOU.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.684
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
TOTALLY USELESS, MAYA.

20:54.684 --> 20:58.888
I CAN BREAK DOWN A SIG SAUER
IN, LIKE, 12 SECONDS.

20:58.888 --> 21:01.461
I'M IMPRESSED.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.963
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A SIG SAUER IS.

21:07.297 --> 21:10.340
â™ª LET THE STORY BEGIN â™ª

21:10.340 --> 21:13.343
â™ªâ™ª

21:21.651 --> 21:23.653
(clock alarm blaring)
OH! STUPID ALARM.

21:23.653 --> 21:25.955
(laughs)

21:25.955 --> 21:27.957
(click, alarm stops)

21:27.957 --> 21:30.019
NO WONDER I CAN'T
GET ANYWHERE ON TIME.

21:30.019 --> 21:33.363
SPEAKING OF WHICH, I ACTUALLY
HAVE TO GO TO THE OFFICE NOW.

21:33.363 --> 21:35.765
EXCITING DAY
COLLARING BAD GUYS?

21:35.765 --> 21:38.027
(laughs) OKAY. YEAH.

21:38.027 --> 21:41.000
YOU WATCH TOO MUCH CABLE.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.874
AND, NO, IT'S ACTUALLY A BUSY
DAY ANALYZING SATELLITE IMAGERY.

21:44.874 --> 21:46.506
SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.908
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET ME GET DRESSED.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:48.908 --> 21:52.011
STAY. EAT FOOD.
RIFLE THROUGH MY STUFF.

21:52.011 --> 21:56.516
JUST LOCK THE DOOR
WHEN YOU LEAVE, OKAY?

21:56.516 --> 21:59.789
WILL I SEE YOU LATER?

21:59.789 --> 22:02.021
ONE OF MY FRIENDS IS HAVING
A SHOWING AT THE MERTON GALLERY.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.993
YEAH.

22:03.993 --> 22:05.955
GREAT.

22:05.955 --> 22:08.498
WE'VE DETERMINED
THAT AT LEST TWO MEN

22:08.498 --> 22:10.500
WERE AWAKE
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.603
MOREOVER, WE'VE DISCOVERED
A RECURRING THEME

22:13.603 --> 22:15.835
OF CROW ATTRITION.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.967
"CROW ATTRITION"?

22:17.967 --> 22:20.740
CROWS DIED ALL OVER THE WORLD
DURING THE RECENT BLACKOUT.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.513
THE SAME THING HAPPENED
IN SOMALIA IN 1991.

22:23.513 --> 22:27.777
NOW I'M NO SCIENTIST, BUT THAT
SEEMS SIGNIFICANT TO ME.

22:27.777 --> 22:30.580
BECAUSE YOU SAW IT
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD?

22:30.580 --> 22:33.953
NO, WE LEARNED ABOUT
THE CROW DEATHS

22:33.953 --> 22:37.887
FROM A LEAD THAT I REMEMBERED
FROM MY FLASH-FORWARD.

22:37.887 --> 22:40.560
AND THIS IS A LEAD
YOU FOLLOWED UP ON YOUR OWN?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.492
MY OFFICE DID, YES.

22:42.492 --> 22:46.766
WHY, EXACTLY, HAS YOUR OFFICE
SET UP ITS OWN INVESTIGATION

22:46.766 --> 22:51.641
WITHOUT GETTING AUTHORIZATION
FROM FBI HEADQUARTERS?

22:51.641 --> 22:54.003
WELL, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

22:54.003 --> 22:57.447
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I SEEMED TO BE--

22:57.447 --> 22:59.779
OR RATHER, THE L.A. OFFICE--

22:59.779 --> 23:03.012
SEEMED TO BE AT THE CENTER
OF THE BLACKOUT INVESTIGATION.

23:03.012 --> 23:04.514
REALLY?

23:04.514 --> 23:06.916
A-AND, UH, HOW DID YOU
DETERMINE THIS?

23:06.916 --> 23:09.789
(lowered voice) HERE WE GO.
IN MY VISION,

23:09.789 --> 23:11.961
I WAS RUNNING POINT
ON SOMETHING CALLED MOSAIC.

23:11.961 --> 23:14.524
(whoosh)
I HAD A CASE BOARD SET UP
IN MY OFFICE,

23:14.524 --> 23:16.496
COVERED IN CLUES,
PICTURES, LEADS--

23:16.496 --> 23:18.498
EVERYTHING
THAT YOU WOULD SEE

23:18.498 --> 23:20.900
IN AN ONGOING,
FRUITFUL INVESTIGATION.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.002
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE INVESTIGATING THIS

23:23.002 --> 23:26.075
BECAUSE YOU HAD A VISION
OF INVESTIGATING THIS.

23:26.075 --> 23:28.007
OKAY. YOU HAVE
A BULLETIN BOARD

23:28.007 --> 23:31.441
WITH LOTS OF NICE PICTURES
ON IT.

23:31.441 --> 23:34.644
BUT WHAT LED YOU TO ASSUME
YOUR INVESTIGATION

23:34.644 --> 23:37.617
WOULD ACTUALLY AMOUNT
TO ANYTHING?

23:39.649 --> 23:40.950
BECAUSE, MADAME CHAIR,

23:40.950 --> 23:43.553
I ALSO SAW
A TEAM OF MASKED GUNMEN

23:43.553 --> 23:45.995
TRYING TO KILL ME...
(whoosh)

23:45.995 --> 23:48.027
PRESUMABLY FOR WHAT
WE WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED

23:48.027 --> 23:50.830
IN THIS INVESTIGATION
OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.832
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,

23:52.832 --> 23:55.465
MASKED GUNMEN ARE GOING TO
BURST INTO YOUR OFFICE

23:55.465 --> 23:57.837
IN A SECURE FEDERAL BUILDING

23:57.837 --> 24:01.010
AND TRY TO KILL YOU?

24:02.572 --> 24:04.914
THAT'S WHAT I SAW, YES.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.024
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

24:15.024 --> 24:17.527
YES. THE GANWAR REGION
IS THE HABITAT

24:17.527 --> 24:19.689
OF THE REMARKABLE
SOMALI PYGMY GERBIL.

24:19.689 --> 24:21.030
AWESOME.

24:21.030 --> 24:24.634
SO HOW WAS YOUR DATE?
WHOA! YOU HAD A DATE?

24:24.634 --> 24:27.597
WAS THERE ANY GROPING?
CAN WE FOCUS, PLEASE,
ON WHAT WE'RE DOING?

24:27.597 --> 24:28.968
(typing on keyboard)

24:28.968 --> 24:30.940
OKAY, IF THE SATELLITE IMAGERY
DOESN'T GIVE US ANYTHING,

24:30.940 --> 24:34.043
THEN LET'S START TO LOOK
AT ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS--

24:34.043 --> 24:36.646
ANOMALIES IN THE OZONE LAYER,

24:36.646 --> 24:39.178
SUNBURST ACTIVITY
DURING THAT TIME, ANYTHING.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.481
ANY REASONABLE EXPLANATIONS?
NOW YOU'RE TALKIN'.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WAIT.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.585
DO YOU SEE THAT?
IS THAT AN ASPHALT ROAD?

24:45.585 --> 24:46.916
GO FORWARD.

24:46.916 --> 24:48.958
(beeping)

24:48.958 --> 24:51.791
WHAT ARE THOSE?

24:51.791 --> 24:54.724
THEY LOOK LIKE PYLONS.
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.028
HUH.
(types)

25:07.076 --> 25:09.879
AGENT BENFORD, WHY WERE YOU
ALONE IN THE OFFICE THAT NIGHT?

25:09.879 --> 25:13.012
PRESUMABLY,
I WAS WORKING LATE.
AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING

25:13.012 --> 25:15.845
BEFORE YOU REALIZED
THE GUNMEN WERE IN THERE?

25:15.845 --> 25:17.847
LOOKING AT
THE MOSAIC CASE BOARD.

25:17.847 --> 25:20.850
I THINK I MIGHT'VE BEEN
ON THE PHONE AT SOME POINT,

25:20.850 --> 25:23.292
BUT I'M NOT SURE
WHO I WAS TALKING TO.

25:23.292 --> 25:25.294
HOW CAN YOU NOT BE SURE?

25:25.294 --> 25:26.826
OTHER PEOPLE

25:26.826 --> 25:29.258
WHO WERE ON THE PHONE
IN THEIR FLASH-FORWARDS

25:29.258 --> 25:31.260
REMEMBER
WHO THEY WERE TALKING TO.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.703
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
SENATOR,

25:33.703 --> 25:36.135
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO THE BUREAU AGENT

25:36.135 --> 25:38.938
WHO POLYGRAPHED ME.
I DID.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.871
HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO PROVIDE
A TRANSCRIPT OF YOUR SESSION.

25:41.871 --> 25:44.243
YOU DESCRIBED YOUR EXPERIENCE

25:44.243 --> 25:47.777
AS "IMPRESSIONISTIC FLASHES
OF REALITY."

25:47.777 --> 25:49.879
IS THIS CORRECT?

25:49.879 --> 25:51.020
YES.

25:51.020 --> 25:53.823
AND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,

25:53.823 --> 25:55.825
YOU'VE RECOUNTED
ABOUT 30 SECONDS WORTH OF...

25:55.825 --> 25:57.857
"IMPRESSIONS."

25:57.857 --> 26:00.990
EVERYONE ELSE WE'VE HEARD FROM,
UNLESS THEY WERE ASLEEP,

26:00.990 --> 26:04.093
EXPERIENCED VIVID,
EASILY RECALLED VISIONS

26:04.093 --> 26:06.796
COVERING THE ENTIRE
2 MINUTES AND 17 SECONDS

26:06.796 --> 26:08.197
OF THE BLACKOUT.

26:08.197 --> 26:11.771
IS THAT A QUESTION?
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

26:11.771 --> 26:15.004
WAS THE BUILDING ON FIRE?
WAS THERE SMOKE IN THE ROOM?

26:15.004 --> 26:17.677
WHY IS EVERYTHING
IN YOUR RECOLLECTION

26:17.677 --> 26:21.050
SO HAZY AND DISJOINTED?

26:21.050 --> 26:22.952
(whoosh)

26:22.952 --> 26:26.055
AS FAR AS I KNOW,
THERE WAS NO FIRE.

26:26.055 --> 26:28.057
THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT

26:28.057 --> 26:30.189
FOR THE STARK,
QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE

26:30.189 --> 26:32.191
BETWEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE
OF THE BLACKOUT

26:32.191 --> 26:35.194
AND EVERYONE ELSE'S?
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
MADAME CHAIR,

26:35.194 --> 26:37.366
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO ALL
7 BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET?

26:39.999 --> 26:41.731
NO, I HAVEN'T,

26:41.731 --> 26:44.203
POSSIBLY BECAUSE
THOSE 7 BILLION PEOPLE

26:44.203 --> 26:47.306
AREN'T SEEKING
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

26:47.306 --> 26:48.978
TO SPEARHEAD AN INVESTIGATION

26:48.978 --> 26:52.942
BASED ON THEIR SOMEWHAT MURKY
FLASH-FORWARDS.

26:52.942 --> 26:55.084
SENATOR CLEMENTE,
COULD I JUST--

26:55.084 --> 26:57.386
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF FEDERAL DOLLARS

26:57.386 --> 27:00.619
HAVE BEEN SPENT BECAUSE OF WHAT
YOU CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.021
DON'T YOU THINK SOMEBODY...

27:02.021 --> 27:05.194
HOW DARE YOU.
SHOULD'VE ASCERTAINED
WHAT YOU WERE DOING

27:05.194 --> 27:07.797
THE OTHER HUNDRED-PLUS SECONDS
OF YOUR VISION?

27:07.797 --> 27:10.900
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS
THESE INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES

27:10.900 --> 27:14.864
SEEM A LITTLE CLOSER
TO VOODOO OR FRAUD?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.638
NOW...

27:19.638 --> 27:23.242
DID SOMEONE HAVE A QUESTION
ABOUT NAZI REPATRIATION?

27:25.114 --> 27:27.376
WHERE THE HELL IS WEDECK?
TOILET?

27:27.376 --> 27:31.120
FOR 40 MINUTES?
(sighs) WENT STRAIGHT TO
VOICE MAIL. WHAT A DISASTER.

27:31.120 --> 27:35.224
WELL, THAT CLEMENTE
IS A HARD-ASS.
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU HEAR IT

27:35.224 --> 27:37.226
LAID OUT LIKE THAT,
IT DOES SOUND QUESTIONABLE.

27:37.226 --> 27:39.759
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE CONSULTED
THE PSYCHIC NETWORK

27:39.759 --> 27:42.431
FOR CLUES OR SOMETHING.
OH, THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT.

27:42.431 --> 27:44.433
I'M NOT SAYING I THINK
THAT NECESSARILY. IT JUST--

27:44.433 --> 27:46.766
IT SOUNDS TOTALLY NUTS--DEAD
BIRDS, D. GIBBONS, DOLL HEADS.
CHINA--

27:46.766 --> 27:48.768
THAT'S STARTING TO SOUND
PRETTY GOOD RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.771
(cell phone rings)
SO IT WAS A MISTAKE
TO MENTION THE DOLLS HEADS,

27:51.771 --> 27:53.773
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
YEAH.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.104
EH.
BENFORD.

27:55.104 --> 27:57.146
(Janis)
Get to a laptop, boyfriend.

27:57.146 --> 27:59.108
WE GOT SOMETHING
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO SEE.
(Mark)
What are we looking at here?

27:59.108 --> 28:00.810
WAJID, SOMALIA--
POPULATION 325,

28:00.810 --> 28:03.883
about 200 miles east of nowhere.
OPRAH'S
BUILDING A SCHOOL THERE?

28:03.883 --> 28:06.455
HONEY, BE QUIET.
THE GROWN-UPS ARE TALKING.

28:06.455 --> 28:10.059
This is a satellite photo
taken December of 1990--

28:10.059 --> 28:12.962
ABOUT FIVE MONTHS BEFORE
YOUR CROWS DID A FACE-PLANT.

28:12.962 --> 28:16.095
WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE?

28:16.095 --> 28:19.869
This is from January,
February, March...

28:19.869 --> 28:23.202
YOU GET THE IDEA.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.875
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE
ABOUT 100 FEET TALL

28:25.875 --> 28:30.439
when they were completed
here in April of 1991.

28:30.439 --> 28:33.883
THE SAME MONTH
OUR PROTO-BLACKOUT HIT.

28:33.883 --> 28:35.885
Any idea
what these structures are?
BEATS ME,

28:35.885 --> 28:37.887
BUT IT'S THE LAST THING
I'D EXPECT TO SEE

28:37.887 --> 28:41.020
AT A PLACE THAT DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE INDOOR PLUMBING.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.953
WE'RE SENDING THE IMAGES DOWN
TO FORENSICS FOR EVALUATION.

28:43.953 --> 28:45.955
STATE DEPARTMENT'S
BEEN STONEWALLING US

28:45.955 --> 28:48.758
ON OUR REQUEST
TO SEND A TEAM IN.

28:48.758 --> 28:50.960
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'LL
CUT THROUGH SOME RED TAPE.

29:04.413 --> 29:06.145
(speed-dials)

29:09.819 --> 29:12.081
JANIS, THIS IS WEDECK.

29:12.081 --> 29:15.084
MM-HMM. I NEED YOU TO
DO SOMETHING FOR ME RIGHT AWAY.

29:18.427 --> 29:20.229
(indistinct conversations)

29:20.229 --> 29:22.932
HEY, MAYA.
HI.

29:22.932 --> 29:25.064
(both chuckle)

29:25.064 --> 29:28.267
SORRY I'M LATE. MY BOSS CALLED
RIGHT AS I WAS OUT THE DOOR.
NO WORRIES.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.969
WOW.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.101
I GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING.

29:32.101 --> 29:35.004
THANK YOU.
I JUST SAW IT
AND THOUGHT OF YOU.

29:35.004 --> 29:37.076
(chuckles)
(clock chimes)

29:37.076 --> 29:39.548
(automated male voice) WAKE UP.
IT'S TIME TO GET UP.
(laughs)

29:39.548 --> 29:41.811
SO YOU'RE NOT LATE ANYMORE,
UNLESS YOU WANNA BE.
THANK YOU.

29:41.811 --> 29:43.883
WAKE UP.
(clicks button)

29:43.883 --> 29:46.956
THAT'S VERY SWEET.
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

29:46.956 --> 29:49.989
YEAH.
IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.561
(laughs) YOU'RE GETTING
ALL FLUSTERED.

29:52.561 --> 29:55.264
DO YOU DATE GUYS, TOO?

29:55.264 --> 29:57.496
UM... THE LAST ONE
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

29:57.496 --> 29:59.999
AND I TRY NOT TO THINK
ABOUT IT. WHY?

29:59.999 --> 30:02.972
WELL, I-I GUESS THAT'S THE PART
THAT'S AWKWARD. UM...

30:02.972 --> 30:04.974
I KIND OF DID SOMETHING.

30:04.974 --> 30:07.506
(gasps) YOU WENT THROUGH
MY STUFF!

30:07.506 --> 30:09.979
OH, I KNEW
YOU WOULD DO THAT.

30:09.979 --> 30:11.510
NO.
HMM?

30:11.510 --> 30:14.243
I DID THE NEXT BEST THING.

30:14.243 --> 30:16.215
I MOSAIC-ed YOU.

30:17.987 --> 30:20.819
YOU WHAT?
I COULDN'T RESIST.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.252
YOU KNOW, IT'S WAY BETTER
THAN GOOGLE STALKING.

30:23.252 --> 30:26.595
I SAW THAT
IN FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW,

30:26.595 --> 30:28.898
YOU'LL BE...

30:28.898 --> 30:30.900
YOU KNOW...

30:30.900 --> 30:32.131
PREGNANT.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.302
(whoosh)

30:35.064 --> 30:38.437
OH.
AND AS TALENTED AS I MAY BE
IN THE BEDROOM...

30:38.437 --> 30:40.609
YEAH, THAT'D BE
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

30:40.609 --> 30:42.611
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

30:42.611 --> 30:47.076
I MEAN, IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I'M WEARING A WEDDING RING.

30:48.177 --> 30:51.080
MAYBE--MAYBE IT'S OURS.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.082
(sighs) LOOK,
FOR W-WHAT IT'S WORTH,

30:53.082 --> 30:56.425
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE A GREAT MOM.

30:56.425 --> 30:59.158
AND THAT WAS
THE WRONG THING TO SAY, TOO.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.291
(sighs) THIS ISN'T...

31:02.291 --> 31:04.293
A "ME/YOU" THING, MAYA.

31:04.293 --> 31:07.066
THIS IS A "ME" THING.

31:07.066 --> 31:10.539
AND HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T EVEN
FIGURED IT OUT YET.

31:10.539 --> 31:13.903
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

31:16.645 --> 31:18.877
YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:18.877 --> 31:21.951
I... (sighs)

31:21.951 --> 31:24.483
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS...

31:24.483 --> 31:25.915
RIGHT NOW.

31:25.915 --> 31:27.586
(mouths word)

31:27.586 --> 31:30.219
I'M SORRY.

31:30.219 --> 31:32.221
I'M REALLY SORRY.

31:41.931 --> 31:43.472
HELLO, STAN.

31:43.472 --> 31:45.504
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.436
MAY I COME IN, RENEE?

31:52.141 --> 31:54.013
MY MAN!

31:54.013 --> 31:57.016
HELLO, MY MAN!

31:57.016 --> 32:00.319
WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?
WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?
(giggles)

32:08.097 --> 32:10.229
LONG WAY FROM $2 BEER NIGHT
AT GENO'S.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.001
(glasses clink)

32:15.634 --> 32:18.167
MY FIRST TERM WAS A BITCH.

32:18.167 --> 32:19.969
I COULD'VE USED YOU, STAN.

32:19.969 --> 32:22.471
REALLY, I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T BRING YOU IN.

32:22.471 --> 32:24.243
BUT I CAN NOW.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.975
SO...

32:25.975 --> 32:27.977
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT D.H.S.?

32:27.977 --> 32:31.150
I KNOW YOU'D LOVE BEING
ANASTASIA MARKHAM'S BOSS.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.281
WE HA--

32:41.230 --> 32:44.133
I'M NOT HERE ABOUT THE JOB.

32:44.133 --> 32:46.395
SO NO MORE BOY SCOUT?

32:46.395 --> 32:49.098
HOW'D YOU FIND HER?

32:49.098 --> 32:51.100
WELL, I WAS THE BAGMAN
WHO PAID HER

32:51.100 --> 32:53.572
A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS
TO DISAPPEAR. REMEMBER?

32:53.572 --> 32:57.146
ONLY SHE DIDN'T GO VERY FAR.
SHE'S LIVING WITH THE BOY

32:57.146 --> 32:59.648
RIGHT HERE IN GEORGETOWN,
IN FACT.

32:59.648 --> 33:02.011
AND YOU KNOW THAT HOW?

33:02.011 --> 33:04.653
THROUGH OUR MOSAIC WEB SITE.

33:04.653 --> 33:06.985
IT'S REALLY QUITE AMAZING
HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE

33:06.985 --> 33:08.987
TO CROSS-REFERENCE
ALL THESE PEOPLE'S VISIONS.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.420
TURNS OUT MS. GARRIGOS
HAD A VISION, TOO.

33:11.420 --> 33:15.024
SHE SAW HERSELF LIVING IN
PUERTO RICO SIX MONTHS FROM NOW.

33:15.024 --> 33:17.026
AND IN HER MOSAIC POST,

33:17.026 --> 33:19.098
SHE REMARKED
HOW DIFFERENT THAT WAS

33:19.098 --> 33:21.400
FROM HER CURRENT HOME
IN GEORGETOWN.

33:23.632 --> 33:26.635
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKED
ABOUT HAVING YOU AROUND, STAN?

33:26.635 --> 33:28.677
HMM?

33:28.677 --> 33:32.611
YOU WEREN'T JUST...
COMFORTABLE IN THE MUD.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.484
YOU ENJOY BEING THERE.

33:38.187 --> 33:41.190
CLEMENTE IS GOING TO CUT OFF
THE FUNDING UNLESS YOU STOP HER.

33:41.190 --> 33:42.721
SO... STOP HER.

33:42.721 --> 33:46.525
AND THE NEGATIVE
GOES INTO THE SHREDDER.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.628
YOU CAN ONLY PLAY THIS
CARD ONCE, YOU KNOW.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.730
YOU SURE YOU WANNA
PLAY IT NOW?

33:53.332 --> 33:56.735
NOW'S ALL I GOT.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.709
AHH.

34:05.144 --> 34:08.217
(door opens and closes)

34:17.726 --> 34:20.159
(dialing)

34:22.731 --> 34:25.734
I'VE GOT A PROBLEM
I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF.

34:25.734 --> 34:29.368
(Night Ranger's
"Sister Christian" playing)

34:29.368 --> 34:31.840
â™ª MOTORING â™ª

34:31.840 --> 34:35.204
â™ª WHAT'S YOUR PRICE
FOR FLIGHT â™ª

34:35.204 --> 34:36.605
DO IT!

34:36.605 --> 34:41.150
â™ª IN FINDING MR. RIGHT? â™ª

34:41.150 --> 34:43.452
I HATE NIGHT RANGER.

34:43.452 --> 34:46.415
â™ª YOU'RE ALL RIGHT TONIGHT â™ª

34:46.415 --> 34:50.459
THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
FOR YOU TO SLOW DOWN THERE?

34:50.459 --> 34:52.161
â™ªâ™ª

34:52.161 --> 34:54.223
I GOT FIVE MONTHS TO LIVE.

34:54.223 --> 34:57.766
I THINK THAT ENTITLES ME
TO BLOW OFF A LITTLE STEAM, MAN.

34:57.766 --> 34:59.128
(slaps table)

34:59.128 --> 35:02.831
â™ªâ™ª

35:02.831 --> 35:07.436
(both) â™ª SISTER CHRISTIAN,
OH, THE TIME HAS COME â™ª

35:07.436 --> 35:12.181
â™ª AND YOU KNOW
THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE â™ª

35:12.181 --> 35:14.513
â™ª TO SAY â™ª

35:14.513 --> 35:17.346
(sighs deeply)

35:17.346 --> 35:19.148
â™ªâ™ª

35:19.148 --> 35:21.520
YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY?

35:21.520 --> 35:24.122
NOPE.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.795
'CAUSE YOU LOOK
A LITTLE PISSED.

35:26.795 --> 35:28.797
WHY WOULD I BE ANGRY?

35:28.797 --> 35:31.830
JUST BECAUSE YOU BAILED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEARING,

35:31.830 --> 35:33.332
LEFT ME TWISTING--

35:33.332 --> 35:36.835
LET'S BE HONEST.
IT'S NOT LIKE BEING THERE

35:36.835 --> 35:39.168
WOULD'VE KEPT YOU FROM CHOKING
ON THE WITNESS STAND.

35:39.168 --> 35:42.611
YOU WERE FLAILIN' IN THERE!
â™ª YOUR NEXT MEAL â™ª

35:42.611 --> 35:45.814
â™ª OH, HOW DOES IT FEEL â™ª

35:45.814 --> 35:47.316
â™ªâ™ª

35:47.316 --> 35:51.280
â™ª HOW DOES IT FEEL â™ª

35:51.280 --> 35:54.483
â™ª TO BE ON YOUR OWN... â™ª

35:54.483 --> 35:56.485
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL
FOR A RECESS? HUH?

35:56.485 --> 35:59.188
YOU COULD'VE SPOKEN UP
FOR ME.
AND SAID WHAT?

35:59.188 --> 36:01.260
THERE'S A PERFECTLY GOOD
EXPLANATION

36:01.260 --> 36:03.262
WHY YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE
REMEMBERING SOMETHING

36:03.262 --> 36:05.694
THE REST OF US
HAVE LASERED INTO OUR BRAINS?

36:05.694 --> 36:08.367
SEE, THIS IS
MY OWN DAMN FAULT.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.869
CLEMENTE IS JUST
ASKING YOU QUESTIONS

36:10.869 --> 36:13.942
I SHOULD'VE ASKED WEEKS AGO,
BUT I DIDN'T

36:13.942 --> 36:15.604
BECAUSE I TRUSTED YOU.

36:15.604 --> 36:18.207
AND I WENT WITH THIS WHOLE
MOSAIC THING IN THE FIRST PLACE

36:18.207 --> 36:20.849
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU, MARK.
AND I HAVE GOTTEN YOU RESULTS.

36:20.849 --> 36:23.552
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER.

36:23.552 --> 36:25.554
NOW CLEMENTE MAY BE
A TOTAL BITCH,

36:25.554 --> 36:27.556
BUT SHE'S RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING--

36:27.556 --> 36:30.459
YOUR STORY'S GOT MORE HOLES
THAN A KITCHEN SPONGE.

36:30.459 --> 36:32.461
WHY CAN'T YOU REMEMBER
EVERYTHING?

36:32.461 --> 36:34.363
BECAUSE I WAS LOADED, OKAY?!

36:47.906 --> 36:52.441
(scoffs) WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO SAY, STAN?

36:54.783 --> 36:56.785
I'VE BEEN SOBER SEVEN YEARS,

36:56.785 --> 37:02.851
AND I HAVE ZERO INTENTION OF
EVER TAKING ANOTHER DRINK AGAIN.

37:02.851 --> 37:06.224
(whispers) BUT I CAN'T CHANGE
WHAT I SAW.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.757
I...

37:08.757 --> 37:11.660
I PUT MY ENTIRE CAREER
ON THE LINE

37:11.660 --> 37:13.662
BASED ON YOUR FLASH-FORWARD,

37:13.662 --> 37:16.965
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME...

37:16.965 --> 37:19.468
YOU WERE IMPAIRED
WHEN YOU HAD IT?

37:23.872 --> 37:27.416
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
ANYMORE.

37:27.416 --> 37:28.917
â™ªâ™ª

37:28.917 --> 37:30.849
THAT'S FANTASTIC, MARK.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.422
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

37:33.422 --> 37:34.953
EVERYTHING OKAY IN HERE?

37:34.953 --> 37:37.286
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

37:37.286 --> 37:40.659
GUYS, WON'T DON'T YOU
BUY YOURSELVES A COUPLE ROUNDS?

37:40.659 --> 37:41.990
ON ME.

37:41.990 --> 37:46.034
IT'S, UH, CELEBRATION TIME.

37:46.034 --> 37:47.896
WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

37:49.798 --> 37:52.401
I GOT US OUR FUNDING.

38:10.859 --> 38:14.022
(beeping)
POUND-0-3-1-2.

38:14.022 --> 38:15.364
(beep)
SET.

38:15.364 --> 38:17.025
(beeps rapidly)
DAMN IT.

38:17.025 --> 38:17.896
AARON...

38:17.896 --> 38:19.067
(beep)

38:24.333 --> 38:25.504
(beep)

38:33.782 --> 38:35.814
(beep)

38:40.889 --> 38:42.621
(drops cell phone)

38:42.621 --> 38:45.654
ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL,

38:45.654 --> 38:47.656
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD

38:47.656 --> 38:49.057
IF I HAD--
FORGET IT.

38:49.057 --> 38:51.059
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

38:51.059 --> 38:54.363
THE DETAILS I DO REMEMBER,
I REMEMBER CLEARLY.

38:54.363 --> 38:56.865
FABULOUS. LOOK,
JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

38:56.865 --> 39:00.068
YOU TELL ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS,
WE ARE D.O.A.
(woman) IN WASHINGTON,

39:00.068 --> 39:03.111
PRESIDENT SEGOVIA HAS ANNOUNCED
HIS NOMINEE FOR VICE PRESIDENT,

39:03.111 --> 39:05.343
A POSITION
WHICH HAS BEEN VACANT

39:05.343 --> 39:07.916
SINCE THE TRAGIC DEATH
OF VICE PRESIDENT PRATT

39:07.916 --> 39:09.918
DURING THE BLACKOUT.
TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT SAYS

39:09.918 --> 39:12.350
HE HAS NOMINATED
SENATOR JOYCE CLEMENTE.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.353
THE NOMINEE WILL HAVE TO BE
APPROVED BY MAJORITY VOTE...
CLEMENTE?

39:15.353 --> 39:17.355
IN BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.358
(scoffs) I DON'T GET THIS TOWN.
EVERYTHING'S A TRADE-OFF.

39:20.358 --> 39:24.533
D.C.'s YOUR ULTIMATE "CAN'T GET
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING" PLACE.

39:24.533 --> 39:26.535
(vehicle approaches,
gears shift)

39:33.371 --> 39:36.845
(girl wailing)

39:40.909 --> 39:42.981
(screaming and sobbing
continues)

39:42.981 --> 39:45.654
(cell phone rings)

39:45.654 --> 39:47.856
(ring)
HEY, MARK.

39:47.856 --> 39:49.818
JUST WANTED TO SHARE
SOME GOOD NEWS WITH YOU.

39:49.818 --> 39:51.490
WE'VE GOT OUR FUNDING.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.693
Mosaic's still alive.
BECAUSE OF THE SOMALI INTEL?

39:54.693 --> 39:57.626
NO. WEDECK PULLED
SOME KIND OF RABBIT.

39:57.626 --> 39:59.928
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE HE WOULDN'T
HAVE HAD TO IF--

39:59.928 --> 40:02.931
(tires screech, loud crash)

40:02.931 --> 40:05.534
(tires peal)
MARK?

40:11.039 --> 40:13.011
(Vreede and Demetri) NO! NO!

40:15.484 --> 40:18.086
(loud explosion)

40:21.119 --> 40:23.021
HELLO? MARK?

40:23.021 --> 40:23.892
HELLO?
FREEZE!

40:23.892 --> 40:25.423
(gunshot)

40:25.423 --> 40:28.627
AAH! AAH! (grunting)

40:28.627 --> 40:30.629
(bone crunches)
AAH!

40:51.149 --> 40:55.924
(Rolling Stones)
â™ª HOW DOES IT FEEL â™ª

â™ª TO BE ON YOUR OWN â™ª
