00:04.700 --> 00:07.616
Jessica, our son isvaledictorian of Harvard.

00:07.659 --> 00:08.791
Crazy.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.053
Louis, pipe down.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.490
I gave you one rule
for today, remember?

00:12.534 --> 00:14.275
Don't talkin a wicked Boston accent

00:14.318 --> 00:15.189
to order lobster chowder?

00:15.232 --> 00:16.886
Okay, fine.
Two rules.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.584
And it's not crazy
he's up there.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.804
He's always shown
signs of greatness.

00:21.847 --> 00:24.459
Breakfast is served, suckas.

00:24.502 --> 00:27.940
Boom. A literal food pyramid
made from all 10 food groups.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.638
Frozen fish sticks
form the base,

00:29.681 --> 00:31.379
so give her a sec to thaw
before diving in.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.685
10 food groups?Why is it moving?

00:33.729 --> 00:36.471
I still can't believe
you got a 1500 on your SAT.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.168
I still can't believeyou haven't told Mom yet.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.474
Boys, think.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.476
I'm a high-school junior
who doesn't listen well.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.043
Fair.Cautiously following.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.566
I'll tell Mom my score

00:44.609 --> 00:46.437
when I really need
a get-out-of-jail-free card,

00:46.481 --> 00:48.700
like, for example,
I'm in jail.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.746
Yeah.Eddie, clean up the mess
you made in the kitchen.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.835
I got a 1500
on my SATs.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.271
What?!
Wow.

00:54.315 --> 00:57.057
Eddie, I can't believe it!

00:58.319 --> 01:00.190
I did it.

01:27.957 --> 01:31.308
Me pushing Eddie all these years

01:31.352 --> 01:33.528
Top-tier colleges
are back in play.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.659
The football teams
get worse,

01:34.703 --> 01:36.226
but the starting salaries
skyrocket.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.054
You did fill in the oval

01:38.098 --> 01:40.187
letting schools get
your test scores, right?

01:40.230 --> 01:43.494
I filled in every oval I saw --you know, better my chances.

01:43.538 --> 01:44.887
1500, ladies and germs.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.107
1-5-0-0.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.195
Well, I better clean
my pyramid mess.

01:48.238 --> 01:49.935
No, no, no.
You stay.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.111
You deserve to rest.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.940
I'll do the dishes.
What the heck.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.247
Maybe I'll even reconnect
the dishwasher.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.819
Was that a hug?

02:03.862 --> 02:05.690
I've never seen your mother
this happy.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.388
That includes
our wedding day,

02:07.431 --> 02:08.824
but definitely
not our wedding night.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.217
We went for it.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.218
Gross.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.958
I don't trust this.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.743
It's like when a stranger offersyou candy to get in their van.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.962
I mean, you take it --
free candy --

02:17.006 --> 02:18.268
but it never ends well.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.356
Please tell me
you've never gotten in

02:19.400 --> 02:20.357
a stranger's van before.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.359
Eddie, your mom

02:22.403 --> 02:23.708
doesn't get to
experience pure joy often.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.928
She refuses to watch
"Police Academy,"

02:25.971 --> 02:28.670
doesn't "get dogs,"
calls Weird Al a hack.

02:28.713 --> 02:29.758
Let her have this.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.803
Eddie,
forget the kitchen.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.370
We're going out
to celebrate!

02:33.414 --> 02:36.243
Cele-what?
Girl, I got school.

02:36.286 --> 02:38.375
Not today.
School can wait.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.246
Dope.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.726
Motherand oval-filling son.

03:24.769 --> 03:25.857
This stays here.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.032
I don't wantyour Ivy League roommates

03:27.076 --> 03:29.557
drooling overyour mother's flawless skin.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.341
I don't know
about the Ivy League.

03:31.385 --> 03:34.518
I do!
That 1500 changed the game.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.172
We need to update
your life-chart.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.915
Evan has dibs
on president,

03:39.958 --> 03:41.264
but we can Kennedy
this thing,

03:41.308 --> 03:42.657
and you could be
his attorney general.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.573
Emery can be the drunk
with the square head.

03:48.837 --> 03:51.492
Oh, no.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.146
Mom wrote "A Case of a Knife tothe Brain 2: The Second Knife"?

03:54.190 --> 03:55.974
I'm penning my memoir.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.672
I want to get
my life story down

03:57.715 --> 04:00.152
before things get intensein high school.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.851
It'll be way less intense
if you keep that to yourself.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.287
I can't be America's firstDoctor-President

04:04.331 --> 04:05.462
without publishing
a memoir.

04:05.506 --> 04:06.855
I even mocked up a cover.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.902
I'll update the photowhen I'm old enough to run,

04:10.946 --> 04:12.077
maybe grow some stubblefor the ladies --

04:12.121 --> 04:13.253
crucial demo.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.819
Cool.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.299
I've outlined
my next chapter --

04:16.343 --> 04:18.388
"Evan Huang,HOA Vice President."

04:25.656 --> 04:27.571
Matthew: How do you think
this guy went out?

04:27.615 --> 04:29.007
Big-game hunter,

04:29.051 --> 04:31.358
or stepped in front
of the wrong logging truck?

04:31.401 --> 04:33.577
Pushing that much girth
around the woods?

04:33.621 --> 04:34.361
Heart disease all day.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.232
Hey!

04:36.276 --> 04:38.147
Mom liftedher bumper-sticker ban.

04:38.190 --> 04:41.585
She wants you to put this onthe Cattleman's delivery car.
Eddie: Great.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.413
That's what you want on your
bumper during rush hour.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.458
Very rear-end-able.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.635
You have a minute
to talk?

04:47.678 --> 04:48.810
Boss Talk or Dad Talk?

04:48.853 --> 04:49.811
Dad Talk.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.291
Okay.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.598
It's me, Dad.
What's up?

04:54.642 --> 04:56.121
So, I've been thinkinga lot about college

04:56.165 --> 04:57.253
ever since our UCLA trip.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.341
Great trip.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.516
Great trip,

04:59.560 --> 05:01.344
but I don't think I wanta regular school.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.826
I want to go to
culinary school.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.654
Culinary school?

05:06.697 --> 05:09.004
Like for cooking.I know what it means --
sorta.

05:09.047 --> 05:11.006
This is big, Eddie.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.703
I know you're working
at the restaurant with me,

05:12.747 --> 05:14.879
but I didn't realize you were
that passionate about this.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.317
I didn't either,until it dawned on me

05:17.360 --> 05:19.362
the thing I always getexcited about is food...

05:33.420 --> 05:35.465
...creating it,cooking it, eating it.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.727
I love food, Dad!

05:36.771 --> 05:38.990
I love food, too, son.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.905
I love food, too.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.559
You're following
in my footsteps.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.605
Uh, my restaurant footsteps,

05:44.648 --> 05:46.650
not my Cha Cha King of Taipei
footsteps.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.130
Ain't nobody
following those.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.958
Well, I'm glad you're opento culinary school.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.133
Ma won't be.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.482
Yeah.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.136
No way she had this
on my life-chart.

05:54.179 --> 05:57.052
Hey, why don't you
make her a meal,

05:57.095 --> 05:58.662
show her your stuff,

05:58.706 --> 06:00.795
and then we can talk about
culinary school together?

06:00.838 --> 06:02.579
Yeah, that'd be sick!

06:08.672 --> 06:10.457
"Evan Huang for HOA
Vice President:

06:10.500 --> 06:12.459
One Deidre Heartbeat Away."

06:12.502 --> 06:14.286
You said you worked
as a mall elf

06:14.330 --> 06:16.680
to "help
my needy brothers"?

06:16.724 --> 06:18.508
Iworked as a mall elf
to help you!

06:18.552 --> 06:19.901
Uh, time out.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.293
You read my memoir?

06:21.337 --> 06:22.643
Please tell me you wore
the document gloves

06:22.686 --> 06:23.687
sitting next to it.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.559
You stole my story.
You lied!

06:27.387 --> 06:29.127
I'm just giving readers
what they want -- a hero.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.520
Who cares about
the details?

06:30.564 --> 06:31.565
I do.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.393
You can't be presidentif you lie.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.524
It's un-American.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.961
Calling the first
Asian President un-American?

06:37.005 --> 06:39.181
Pretty racist.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.883
This is amazing.

06:45.927 --> 06:48.625
Your mom will have toconsider culinary school.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.061
Each dish is inspired
by her --

06:50.105 --> 06:52.542
Anti-Hobo Stew,
Chicken a la Stephen King,

06:52.586 --> 06:54.239
Aw Hell Gnocchi.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.720
I was out at the mailbox,

06:56.764 --> 06:57.765
and I saw Deidre
in the window.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.594
Dummy took 20 minutes
to notice my sweatshirt.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.512
What's all this?Oh, I made dinner for you.

07:05.555 --> 07:06.861
Why?

07:06.904 --> 07:08.776
Oh, you put a baby
in that redhead, didn't you?

07:08.819 --> 07:10.299
Jessica!
Whoa!

07:10.342 --> 07:11.387
No.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.519
I just wanted
to say thank you

07:12.562 --> 07:13.737
for everything
you've done for me.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.260
Aww!

07:15.304 --> 07:17.567
You got a 1500
andyou cook.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.570
You are going to make some womanI choose a great husband.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.572
So, Mom,I was hoping we could talk.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.095
Sure.

07:24.139 --> 07:25.880
What did you want to --

07:25.923 --> 07:27.316
Eddie got a letter
from Harvard.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.317
I'll open it so you don't
cut your test fingers.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.232
Okay with you?
Great!

07:30.275 --> 07:31.755
Aah!

07:31.799 --> 07:34.366
"Dear Edwyn Huang,

07:34.410 --> 07:36.151
we received your SAT scores

07:36.194 --> 07:37.805
and want to schedule
an interview

07:37.848 --> 07:39.502
with one of our alumni"?

07:47.379 --> 07:49.033
Ah!

07:49.077 --> 07:51.296
Harvard wants to send an alum
here to my house

07:51.340 --> 07:54.082
to interview Eddie,
my son.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.910
Louis: No chance they send
Bill Gates, right?

07:55.953 --> 07:58.695
Because I still can't get
the printer to do landscape.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.741
I got to get moving.
I got to call Connie to gloat.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.699
I got to redecorate the house
to Ivy League standards,

08:02.743 --> 08:04.440
polish the fine china.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.529
Fun fact --
that's my bowling nickname.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.925
Dad, I want to go
to culinary school.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.361
Do I really have to do
this interview?

08:12.404 --> 08:13.580
It'd just be
a waste of time.

08:13.623 --> 08:14.537
Not for your mom.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.844
Ho, ho, ho!

08:16.887 --> 08:17.758
Not a "yo mama" joke.
Sorry.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.760
Eddie, she's worked hard

08:19.803 --> 08:21.022
your whole lifeto give you this opportunity.

08:21.065 --> 08:24.721
Just let her have this,and then we can talkto her about culinary.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.202
Fine.
I'll do it -- for her.

08:27.245 --> 08:28.464
Good.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.726
And if,for whatever reason,

08:29.770 --> 08:31.162
cooking school
doesn't pan out...

08:31.206 --> 08:32.773
Pan out. Nice.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.078
...Harvard is not
the worst backup.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.819
Speak for yourself.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.734
I ain't built for those
Pennsylvania winters.

08:37.778 --> 08:40.432
No, Harvard is...
Yeah.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.698
Aah!
Ahh.

08:44.741 --> 08:45.829
Pay up, Barbie.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.919
Hey, why are you so quiet there,Emory, huh?

08:48.963 --> 08:50.747
Those freshman girls
got your tongue?

08:50.791 --> 08:52.183
Evan's writing a memoir,

08:52.227 --> 08:54.316
and he's stealing stories,making things up.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.665
Well,
he's just spinning yarns

08:55.709 --> 08:57.841
like we used to do
in the Navy -- harmless.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.713
Not like those dirty Marines.

08:59.756 --> 09:00.844
They're actual liars.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.585
N-- O-kay.
You can g--

09:02.629 --> 09:04.195
Emery, your brother'sin eighth grade.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.719
That's a tough time.

09:05.762 --> 09:09.331
He's probably justtooting his own horn.Yeah.

09:09.374 --> 09:10.375
Maybe I am overreacting.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.812
I'm glad you guys
think it's okay

09:11.855 --> 09:12.856
since you're all
in his memoir, too.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.597
We are?
Yeah?
Yeah.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.730
You should see how
he described Liza's birth.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.081
Oh, Marvin!
Where are the keys?

09:20.124 --> 09:22.387
This baby is coming!I can't find 'em!

09:22.431 --> 09:25.216
Oh, this is all too much,even for a Navy man.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.131
Oh, no.

09:27.175 --> 09:30.308
Ohh. I'm fainting.

09:30.352 --> 09:33.964
Oh, who could blame you?

09:34.008 --> 09:37.533
There's not a man alive who canhandle this kind of pressure.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.580
I will deliver the baby.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.149
Honey, give me
two deep breaths.

09:45.193 --> 09:48.196
1, 2...

09:49.893 --> 09:51.982
There she is.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.637
We'll call her Liza.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.555
I had a 17-hour labor

09:59.599 --> 10:01.949
with a rare diagonal breach,no epidural,

10:01.992 --> 10:03.820
and that nerd is trying totake it away from me?

10:03.864 --> 10:05.822
I warned Evan,
but he didn't listen.

10:05.866 --> 10:06.780
He's stubborn.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.521
That's why he'll be
a good politician.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.132
He only cares
about the votes.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.482
And Navy men don't faint!

10:13.525 --> 10:16.137
They pass out
and hit the ground hard

10:16.180 --> 10:19.270
with their pants off and
their shoes on, like men.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.842
Why does our house looklike a Vermont B&B

10:25.886 --> 10:27.844
inside a whaling ship?

10:27.888 --> 10:30.151
I want Harvard to feel at home
for Eddie's interview.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.196
The theme is
"New England Snoot."Smart.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.720
Eddie: Ma,

10:33.763 --> 10:34.982
do I really have
to wear all this?

10:35.025 --> 10:36.592
I mean, look at me.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.333
I want to kick my ass.Eddie, you look great --

10:38.376 --> 10:41.945
like a hip1970s IBM executive.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.687
Places.
Places, everyone.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.996
Together:
Afta-noon!

10:49.039 --> 10:51.825
Hello.
That wasn't creepy at all.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.043
Andy Richter?

10:53.087 --> 10:54.741
You know this intelligent man?

10:54.784 --> 10:57.047
Oh, he's the co-host of"Late Night with Conan O'Brien."

10:57.091 --> 10:59.702
The talk show?I understand zero
of those words.

10:59.746 --> 11:00.790
Yeah, it's a great job.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.575
I sit on the couch
and laugh at Conan's jokes.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.012
Hey, me too.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.274
Alright, look,
it's not that easy, okay?

11:06.317 --> 11:09.059
I mean, there's...lights
and stuff.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.408
So, Andy,you're a Harvard alum?

11:10.452 --> 11:12.802
Oh, God, no.
My name is Andy. Come on.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.804
No, but Conan is,

11:14.848 --> 11:16.501
and sometimes he does
interviews for them,

11:16.545 --> 11:19.243
and then he asks me to do
the interviews for him.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.897
Mm. I like this Conan.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.769
Eh, everybody does.
He's Conan.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.859
He's tall, he's handsome,
he signs my checks.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.991
So, uh,can I get you anything?

11:28.035 --> 11:29.253
Tea?
Something to eat?

11:29.297 --> 11:31.691
My "Simpsons" spec scriptto give to Conan?

11:31.734 --> 11:34.302
Uh, no, it's alright.
I'll just talk to Eddie.Okay.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.825
And you know what?
I will have something to eat.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.567
And drink.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.961
Evan, thank you for
the block-party update.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.571
My pleasure.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.878
Gonna be a scorcher out there,
so sunscreen up, girls.

11:44.921 --> 11:45.922
Up next

11:45.966 --> 11:47.924
are elections
for HOA Vice President.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.274
Any nominations?

11:50.318 --> 11:52.799
Uh, I nominate
Emery Huang.

11:54.278 --> 11:57.107
I accept.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.674
For those who don't know me,
I'm a spelling-bee champ,

11:58.718 --> 12:02.330
writing a memoir,
and love a tucked-in polo!

12:02.373 --> 12:04.027
Those are my credentials.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.159
Just giving people
what they want.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.856
It takes a lot of marbles

12:06.900 --> 12:09.076
to sideswipe the guy
holding a wooden hammer.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.555
-Ooh!

12:10.599 --> 12:12.906
Whoa, Eddie.
You really nailed the SATs.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.255
What was that like?

12:14.298 --> 12:16.736
Tough.I filled in so many ovals,

12:16.779 --> 12:19.173
I didn't have the strengthto zip up my pants for a week.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.131
Well, zippers
are complicated.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.307
I think the Amish are ahead
of the curve on that one.

12:23.351 --> 12:24.569
Jessica: Oh, don't mind me.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.050
Just taking Eddie's cello
to the conservatory.

12:28.617 --> 12:31.620
Ooh! Cello --
the man's violin.

12:31.663 --> 12:34.405
Well, actually,I'm more of a beatboxer.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.320
No kidding!
Let 'er rip.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.935
♪ Ah-booty, booty, booty jam

12:41.978 --> 12:43.588
No, no, over here,
ignore that now!

12:43.632 --> 12:44.459
Eddie's telescope.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.853
Houston, we have a genius.

12:46.896 --> 12:50.117
Gosh, maybe it would be easier
if I just interviewed you.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.859
Great idea.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.469
Well, uh, Eddie,
do you have any questions

12:54.512 --> 12:56.514
for me, for Conan,
for Harvard?

12:56.558 --> 12:58.081
Yes.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.169
How hard will
they make him work?

12:59.213 --> 13:00.867
Eddie loves hard work.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.869
Huh?
Huh.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.044
Well, he didn't at first.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.220
I've always had to
push him to succeed.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.528
Eddie, focus!

13:10.572 --> 13:12.530
Aah!
Where's my bed?!

13:12.574 --> 13:14.054
Beds are for people
who work hard.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.883
Recommit yourself to school
and hard work,

13:16.926 --> 13:18.058
you get your bed back.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.015
Mom?

13:19.059 --> 13:20.408
For the next
three months

13:20.451 --> 13:21.844
while I'm busy
studying for grad school,

13:21.888 --> 13:25.021
you will be by my side
PSAT prepping.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.327
Study buddies.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.459
Wow. You've really
done a lot for Eddie.

13:28.503 --> 13:31.027
I drive my boys
to be the best.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.855
Jessica don't raise
mediocre.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.118
That's actually
very helpful to hear.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.685
Yes,
that's why I said it.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.427
Alright, well, uh,
I've got to get going.

13:39.470 --> 13:43.866
"Conan" has another interview
in Daytona Beach.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.433
Uh, hey, Andy.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.609
Uh, complimentary
basket of oranges.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.872
My "Simpsons" spec scriptis on the bottom.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.221
Homer takes Lisa square dancingand then loses her.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.702
It's called "Do-Si-D'oh!"

13:53.745 --> 13:55.617
Yeah, perfect.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.619
They're always hungry for ideasfrom the random public.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.621
Really? That's great.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.059
Mm.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.845
So, what did you think of Eddie?What will you tell the school?

14:05.888 --> 14:08.586
Should I preorder
my license plate for him now?

14:08.630 --> 14:11.894
Okay, look, I've done
a lot of these things,

14:11.938 --> 14:14.418
and Harvard is not
gonna be a fit.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.985
What?

14:16.029 --> 14:18.945
Oh, it was his
mouth-rapping, wasn't it?

14:18.988 --> 14:20.250
Oh, no, no,
that was excellent --

14:20.294 --> 14:22.426
I mean,
Michael Winslow-nian.

14:22.470 --> 14:26.691
No, i-it's not so much Eddie
as it is you.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.041
Me?

14:28.084 --> 14:31.305
Yeah, you're a bit of
a helicopter mom,

14:31.348 --> 14:35.787
and Harvard's found that, when
a parent is so...invested

14:35.831 --> 14:38.007
that the kid tends to fizzle out

14:38.051 --> 14:39.269
once they're finally
on their own.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.793
Eh, helicopter mom,
that's not me.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.143
Hey, who put this in my room?

14:46.363 --> 14:48.888
Well,
thanks for the oranges.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.417
Eddie can't go to Harvard
because of me.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.945
Jessica.
I pushed you
your whole life

15:02.989 --> 15:04.686
for a school like Harvard,
but I pushed too hard.

15:04.729 --> 15:06.731
I failed you.
What?

15:06.775 --> 15:08.037
No, I wasn't thatbig on Harvard anyways.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.170
I mean, their mascot's
a friggin' color.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.867
Well, I guess there are
other top schools.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.087
Why, it is the Ivy League
after all.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.523
Or there are
other options.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.655
Okay, new plan!

15:17.699 --> 15:18.961
We go to the schools
to interview.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.397
We ambush them.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.008
I'll find
the admissions director,

15:22.051 --> 15:24.097
tell him that if he doesn't
accept Eddie,

15:24.140 --> 15:25.489
it's time
for some smacks --

15:25.533 --> 15:28.144
hitting smacks,
not kissing smacks.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.972
Ma, you don't have to
do that.

15:30.016 --> 15:33.149
Of course I do.
I ruined Harvard!

15:33.193 --> 15:35.412
You didn't ruin it,
because I didn't want
to go to college.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.501
I want to go to
culinary school.

15:42.811 --> 15:45.335
Then I guess I really did
fail you as a mother.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.342
Okay.
I'll tally the votes.

15:52.386 --> 15:55.389
Hey, dingbat.
What the "H" was that?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.043
You took credit
for my success,

15:57.086 --> 15:59.262
plucked my feathers
for your cap.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.394
I was just proving a point.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.004
Well,
this isn't a joke, kid.

16:02.048 --> 16:05.051
This is the doggone
HOA Vice Presidency!
Mm.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.444
Doesn't feel so goodwhen someone stealsyour story, does it?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.969
The dark underbelly
of plagiarism.

16:12.275 --> 16:15.017
Evan, you saw how
everyone reacted

16:15.061 --> 16:16.192
when I shared your story.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.193
It's powerful enoughon its own.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.195
When you get to
high school,

16:19.239 --> 16:21.284
the operating room,
the oval office...

16:21.328 --> 16:23.983
you don't need to be anythingother than who you are.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.201
I love that guy.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.335
Alright, y'all.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.032
Congrats to the new
Vice President,

16:30.076 --> 16:31.991
Emery Huang!

16:32.034 --> 16:33.993
This -- This is why

16:34.036 --> 16:36.038
we need to do away
with the popular vote.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.484
Here's the thing, kids,
but I've taken this sucker

16:47.528 --> 16:50.574
to 150 miles an hour
on a residential street.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.489
Matthew: Taking the ranchon the road.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.796
Brings me back to
my Dolly days --

16:54.839 --> 16:57.146
minus the groupies
and the wigs.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.539
Oh, you worked
at Dollywood?

16:58.582 --> 17:00.019
I wasn't sure, because
you haven't mentioned it

17:00.062 --> 17:01.716
since yesterday.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.372
Yo, Pops.Ma's not doing so well.

17:05.415 --> 17:08.070
Louis: Oh, yowza.
Mac and cheese?

17:08.114 --> 17:09.332
And we're out of LACTAID.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.986
This is my fault.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.205
I shouldn't have pushed you
to do that interview.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.423
No, it's my bad.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.643
I knew she'd hate
culinary school,

17:15.686 --> 17:19.125
but I thoughtshe'd be mad, not sad.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.300
I broke Mom.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.606
Meatball: Okay, everybody.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.087
Let's keep that energy going
