00:41.625 --> 00:45.915
I've waited here for you all this time.

00:47.666 --> 00:50.290
I believed you'd come see me

00:51.458 --> 00:57.207
The moment you meet me,
you and I will become one.

00:59.208 --> 01:02.999
I threw myself away to become you.

01:03.833 --> 01:09.624
From now on,
so that I can live in your mind and body...

01:10.541 --> 01:12.874
Open the door to your soul.

01:13.708 --> 01:18.499
And then, love everything I ever have...

01:18.708 --> 01:20.499
Including her.

01:21.541 --> 01:26.915
"Colors of Wind"

01:28.541 --> 01:33.749
3 years ago, the world changed,
taking me with it.

01:33.916 --> 01:38.874
And I just got dragged along,
not knowing anything.

01:39.541 --> 01:42.624
Masao, where have you been for so long?

01:42.625 --> 01:44.457
Didn't I say?

01:44.458 --> 01:48.040
2 billion light years away on Planet Erf.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.707
It's just like Earth.

01:49.708 --> 01:53.415
What? Erf? It's just like Earth?

01:53.416 --> 01:54.790
Exactly the same.

01:54.791 --> 01:57.707
Exactly, huh? Then why go?

01:57.708 --> 02:02.207
Right, there's no need to go.
But there are differences

02:02.208 --> 02:03.499
Like What?

02:03.500 --> 02:06.249
You're an edible ant there.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.290
Excuse me?

02:07.291 --> 02:10.539
And I'm dating the actress Haruka Ayase.

02:10.541 --> 02:13.957
You might be served as a snack soon.

02:13.958 --> 02:16.082
Why am I an edible ant?

02:16.083 --> 02:19.540
And why don't you move there with Haruka?

02:19.583 --> 02:22.582
Actually, I can take you all there.

02:22.583 --> 02:28.124
What? Then leave Haruka
and me and go to that planet?

02:28.125 --> 02:32.332
When I count to three,
you all will go to a different world.

02:32.333 --> 02:33.332
Ready?

02:33.333 --> 02:34.874
Packing is unnecessary.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.332
So are toothbrushes.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.082
Girlfriends and boyfriends too.

02:39.083 --> 02:41.207
One, two, one two...

02:41.208 --> 02:43.165
One, two, three!

02:43.416 --> 02:45.040
My name is Ryo.

02:45.625 --> 02:49.457
I'm unemployed, but I wasn't always like this.

02:50.666 --> 02:54.040
I just suddenly wanted to be like a cocoon.

02:55.416 --> 02:59.374
Because in the end, a cocoon becomes a butterfly.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.957
Today feels different from usual.

03:05.083 --> 03:08.207
When I awoke, I was on a different planet.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.540
Is that what is happening?

03:38.666 --> 03:42.499
Until just recently, I was one of them.

03:43.166 --> 03:48.290
Now, they're on the inside,
and I'm on the outside.

03:49.416 --> 03:52.374
Or maybe it's the opposite.

04:00.333 --> 04:03.874
"Bar Houdini"

04:15.750 --> 04:16.874
Houdini?

04:18.333 --> 04:20.207
So the owner has changed?

04:21.708 --> 04:24.749
This was Mr. and Mrs. Tanaka's diner.

04:24.916 --> 04:28.290
Starting today, it's called Houdini.

04:28.541 --> 04:30.249
I see.

04:30.833 --> 04:34.124
Wait, are you Ryo by any chance?

04:41.500 --> 04:44.249
You really don't remember?

04:44.333 --> 04:46.124
I'm sorry.

04:47.250 --> 04:51.415
You asked Mr. Tanaka to hold on to this.

04:52.291 --> 04:57.499
And Mr. Tanaka told me
to give this back when you came.

04:58.708 --> 05:00.874
I really don't remember.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.624
I left this?

05:03.708 --> 05:04.749
Yeah.

05:04.833 --> 05:08.082
It was exactly 1 00 nights ago.

05:08.333 --> 05:12.290
You brought this box
and said that in 1 00 days...

05:13.708 --> 05:15.874
You would come pick it up.

05:16.666 --> 05:20.624
You also said you might not remember this.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.999
And this is exactly what's happening.

05:30.208 --> 05:35.040
Ryo, perhaps you want to become a magician?

05:35.125 --> 05:36.790
Mr. Tanaka said that?

05:37.083 --> 05:39.957
Gosh... Don't be surprised.

05:40.041 --> 05:43.332
The theme of this place is magic.

05:43.875 --> 05:47.540
Many famous magicians will come here.

05:48.250 --> 05:52.332
If you want to become a real magician,

05:53.166 --> 05:56.332
You should start coming here.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.332
It's an awfully good picture.

06:22.125 --> 06:25.082
Imagine it's me and greet it every day.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.415
Don't be mean to it.

07:08.875 --> 07:12.415
These are my belongings that Yuri had.

07:15.291 --> 07:19.124
Rather, they seem like Yuri's things that

07:19.125 --> 07:21.832
have a connection with me.

07:47.375 --> 07:50.499
But what is this candy?

07:51.291 --> 07:52.999
A present for me?

07:59.375 --> 08:03.290
One day, I was told about her death.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.540
I drank heavily.

08:05.833 --> 08:09.582
After that, I turned my back to the world

08:09.708 --> 08:13.624
And shut myself in here
like a cocoon for 1 00 days.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.957
Maybe it's time to become a butterfly.

08:53.708 --> 08:56.790
One day, she stopped showing herself.

08:58.291 --> 09:00.415
She wouldn't answer my calls.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.874
It was like a UFO abducted her.

09:04.291 --> 09:07.332
She disappeared without a trace.

09:08.541 --> 09:11.665
Then one day, I got a call...

09:12.250 --> 09:13.582
From her number.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.124
I...

09:16.666 --> 09:18.832
I'm Yuri's mother.

09:19.041 --> 09:23.415
You know Yuri, yes? Yuri Kawaguchi.

09:23.666 --> 09:25.332
Yes.

09:26.250 --> 09:29.790
Yuri died the other day.

09:30.541 --> 09:33.749
Her funeral has already been held.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.457
I was shocked, but I had expected it.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.415
She must have died.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.415
That's how she disappeared.

09:45.625 --> 09:49.790
I thought I should tell you.

09:53.541 --> 09:57.915
It seems you were close with Yuri.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.749
We dated for a year.

10:01.750 --> 10:06.415
She never told me, so I didn't know.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.582
I'm sorry.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.540
Don't worry.

10:10.708 --> 10:14.124
I should have known about her passing.

10:14.541 --> 10:16.915
I should be apologizing.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.540
Oh no.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.415
If you were Yuri's boyfriend...

10:24.083 --> 10:26.665
Do you know anything?

10:27.791 --> 10:31.624
Why did she take her own life?

10:33.375 --> 10:35.374
How could I explain?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.582
If I said Yuri didn't die

10:38.583 --> 10:42.415
but disappeared,
will she understand?

10:47.791 --> 10:48.790
Are you crying?

10:50.666 --> 10:53.665
Yeah, I'm crying.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.665
Why?

10:56.333 --> 10:57.832
I don't know.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.249
It'd be nice if you did.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.749
Can you cry when you want to?

11:11.458 --> 11:13.665
Laugh when you want to?

11:16.541 --> 11:18.915
Emotions are selfish.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.540
I can't cry when I want to.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.874
Or laugh when I want to.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.665
Why do I get those emotions?

11:35.833 --> 11:38.415
I usually don't know why.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.374
You smile unconsciously too.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.582
You're right.

11:52.125 --> 11:55.790
There's something I vaguely know.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.749
I won't live much longer.

12:04.166 --> 12:08.165
I might disappear from this world.

12:09.666 --> 12:13.624
Afterwards, I think it was
when we went to Tokyo Tower.

12:14.666 --> 12:15.957
Right now...

12:16.250 --> 12:20.207
There's someone in Japan
who looks exactly like me.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.582
She's much smarter than I am.

12:26.958 --> 12:28.957
Much happier...

12:29.583 --> 12:31.790
And much more beautiful.

12:37.833 --> 12:40.457
I can't be as happy as her.

12:42.916 --> 12:46.832
If I die, can I become her?

12:53.458 --> 12:55.290
I...

12:55.958 --> 12:59.249
I feel like my life is fake.

13:04.541 --> 13:06.582
If I die...

13:07.958 --> 13:09.999
Go find her.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.124
Right now...

13:14.750 --> 13:18.040
She's watching drift ice in Hokkaido.

13:22.625 --> 13:25.207
I want to see what she sees.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.832
In my mind,

13:29.833 --> 13:34.790
I see her standing on the deck
of an icebreaker boat.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.207
Don't look for me.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.874
I won't look for you either.

13:47.958 --> 13:49.290
But...

13:50.416 --> 13:52.207
We'll meet again.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.540
Nevertheless...

13:58.333 --> 14:03.790
I can take comfort in knowing
that she had a boyfriend.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.832
Thank you.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.749
For being my daughter's boyfriend.

14:15.958 --> 14:17.707
Thank you.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.207
Thank you so much.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.249
Disappointed?

14:45.666 --> 14:50.290
I'll do a magic trick just for you.

15:06.875 --> 15:09.124
It's clearly an empty box.

15:09.583 --> 15:14.124
I'll put something in this box
that's from your house.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.749
It can't be too big.

15:21.958 --> 15:23.457
Close your eyes.

15:36.958 --> 15:38.415
Now open them.

15:39.541 --> 15:43.124
Look inside when you get home.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.624
Study under Mr. Kitta?

16:23.750 --> 16:24.874
Yes.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.499
That's a problem.

16:26.958 --> 16:31.290
He doesn't take students
and he rarely comes here

16:32.541 --> 16:34.290
But that's okay.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.415
I know many great teachers.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.915
Sorry to keep you waiting.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.832
Your magic teacher will come soon.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.249
Okay, we'll be practicing.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.457
Okay.

17:00.958 --> 17:03.832
Everybody, sorry for the wait.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.999
I'm James Katsuragi.

17:06.708 --> 17:08.582
Welcome.

17:08.833 --> 17:11.999
You're the teacher?

17:12.165 --> 17:15.124
I am the owner's doppelganger.

17:15.415 --> 17:19.624
He and I are the same,
but we're different people.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.915
Don't ever say that again.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.790
I despise him.

17:26.875 --> 17:30.707
However, he respects me.

17:32.708 --> 17:37.582
Everybody, I have some super funky magic.

17:38.208 --> 17:43.665
Tonight, your own two hands will create a miracle.

17:44.208 --> 17:47.082
Magic is a miracle indeed.

17:47.166 --> 17:51.457
Your own hands will create a miracle.

21:14.958 --> 21:17.665
Eight, nine, ten!

21:51.583 --> 21:54.957
Ryu Murayama was performing an escape trick.

21:55.291 --> 22:00.457
After sinking in the winter sea,
he failed to escape and went missing.

22:00.708 --> 22:05.082
Ryu's original plan was to appear on drift ice.

22:05.125 --> 22:08.624
However, Ryu Murayama never returned.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.915
Here is footage of the incident.

22:12.208 --> 22:16.790
After Ryu went missing, the authorities and staff

22:16.833 --> 22:20.165
Searched for the box he was trapped in

22:20.250 --> 22:21.540
You know...

22:22.666 --> 22:25.624
Doesn't that Ryu guy look like me?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.124
Now that you mention it, yeah

22:30.541 --> 22:33.665
I bet he's just like me under his mask.

22:33.708 --> 22:37.332
Maybe he's your doppelganger.

22:37.666 --> 22:40.457
Doppelganger?
You mean playing two roles like you?

22:40.458 --> 22:41.665
Doppelganger?
You mean playing two roles like you?

22:41.791 --> 22:42.999
No.

22:43.875 --> 22:46.874
Doppelgangers really exist.

22:47.958 --> 22:53.082
Somewhere in this world,
there's someone identical to you.

22:53.416 --> 22:57.457
Throughout history,
people everywhere have believed so.

22:58.166 --> 23:02.915
Even Goethe and Edgar Allan Poe
had doppelgangers.

23:03.958 --> 23:09.165
In old Japanese records too,
it's called the "Shadow Disease".

23:09.916 --> 23:12.915
Even I've heard of that.

23:14.291 --> 23:17.624
When one finds out about the other,

23:17.791 --> 23:23.082
They become tormented by extreme suicidal thoughts.

23:25.083 --> 23:28.707
And in the end, they take their own life.

23:29.833 --> 23:33.540
Then you or the magic teacher has to die.

23:33.541 --> 23:35.082
It's fine.

23:35.083 --> 23:39.415
The two of us have already surpassed such matters.

23:40.541 --> 23:42.165
So don't worry.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.082
I don't buy it.

23:44.541 --> 23:49.415
And maybe also with Ryu, the Hokkaido magician...

23:51.333 --> 23:55.540
He was your doppelganger,
and because he learned of you,

23:55.541 --> 23:57.457
He died from it.

23:57.833 --> 24:00.040
"Ryu Murayama"

24:45.750 --> 24:50.332
Yuri said someone like her was in Hokkaido.

24:51.583 --> 24:56.332
If someone like her exists,
the same must go for me.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.582
A doppelganger?

25:03.083 --> 25:06.874
Will a double of her really be in Hokkaido?

25:08.083 --> 25:12.957
Someone prettier and happier than her.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.582
Ryu

27:29.125 --> 27:31.665
A magic trick like this isn't just for me.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.999
We have an apology and an announcement.

28:14.041 --> 28:15.249
Due to a cave-in accident,

28:15.250 --> 28:18.332
The Okhotsk Train for Abashiri

28:18.708 --> 28:21.457
Will stop at Kitami Station

28:21.541 --> 28:25.290
The repairs will take about an hour.

28:25.416 --> 28:28.665
Please wait inside the train, station building,

28:28.708 --> 28:32.665
Or somewhere safe near the station.

29:05.833 --> 29:07.874
"Kitami Station"

30:42.583 --> 30:43.874
Ryu

30:44.833 --> 30:47.790
You're Ryu, the great magician!

30:48.583 --> 30:50.624
What are you planning?

30:51.541 --> 30:53.999
Not time to appear yet?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.290
Still doing your escape trick?

30:57.208 --> 30:58.665
Or was it...

31:00.666 --> 31:02.749
An act to run away from me?

31:05.041 --> 31:06.999
Say something!

31:07.833 --> 31:08.957
I'm sorry.

31:10.208 --> 31:12.332
I don't remember.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.249
I don't remember anything.

31:19.125 --> 31:20.249
Ryu.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.040
I knew it.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.040
That you were always beside me.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.957
If I came here...

31:32.375 --> 31:34.499
I knew I could find you.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.624
Where have you been?
What do you remember last?

31:54.250 --> 31:58.249
Don't worry. You can take your time.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.290
I'm just happy we met again, Ryu.

32:03.708 --> 32:05.665
You don't have to explain.

32:06.166 --> 32:07.332
Just...

32:08.916 --> 32:11.082
Just don't disappear again.

32:12.833 --> 32:14.082
Okay?

32:14.958 --> 32:18.124
We're going to see drift ice together again.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.582
There, I'll tell you

32:24.583 --> 32:26.624
how we, Ryu and Aya, met.

32:28.958 --> 32:31.165
We can just make new memories.

32:37.583 --> 32:38.749
I didn't mind.

32:39.833 --> 32:44.290
I was Ryu for her, she was Yuri for me.

32:45.791 --> 32:50.707
She met Ryu and I met Yuri.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.207
I met you in college.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.332
It was the day of our show.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.040
We were more excited for
your magic than our show.

33:50.041 --> 33:53.332
We were more excited for
your magic than our show.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.332
Because you were a handsome, young magician.

34:03.208 --> 34:08.415
She started talking about
how she met a man named Ryu.

34:54.833 --> 34:56.248
Great job!

35:08.250 --> 35:09.415
I'm going now.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.207
Hurry up.

35:15.750 --> 35:19.540
You in the fourth row, pick a card.

35:22.833 --> 35:25.207
7 of hearts Very well.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.749
Go up there.

36:13.208 --> 36:15.999
You are about to disappear.

36:17.041 --> 36:18.624
Are you ready?

36:20.166 --> 36:23.207
But don't worry. You'll come right back.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.374
Here it goes.

37:39.708 --> 37:41.749
Enjoy your trip?

37:42.958 --> 37:45.499
You may go back now.

38:10.166 --> 38:13.082
I'm interested in the supernatural too.

38:15.291 --> 38:18.582
Anything that can't be explained by science,

38:18.791 --> 38:21.999
People say it's an illusion or a coincidence.

38:25.166 --> 38:28.499
The happiest moment
during a supernatural incident

38:28.500 --> 38:30.790
Is when love begins

38:31.916 --> 38:35.165
After all, Love is the most magical thing

38:39.916 --> 38:42.290
The moment I saw you,

38:42.291 --> 38:44.665
I had fallen for your magic, Aya.

38:46.708 --> 38:48.832
Liar. You're lying.

38:50.208 --> 38:51.874
Shall we see...

38:52.875 --> 38:55.290
How much I fell for you?

38:56.375 --> 38:58.332
Put your hand on my chest.

39:07.708 --> 39:10.540
My heart has never beaten so loud.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.249
Can you feel my heartbeat?

39:23.583 --> 39:25.665
My heart popped out.

40:00.166 --> 40:01.790
What's going on?

40:02.791 --> 40:04.624
I didn't hear about this.

40:05.625 --> 40:09.040
I'll show you a trick
where I escape from that ocean.

40:09.333 --> 40:11.540
Isn't that dangerous?

40:12.625 --> 40:16.415
The more dangerous it looks,
The more entertaining.

40:18.125 --> 40:20.874
It'll be thrilling for you too.

40:22.291 --> 40:24.874
You're lying. You're dumping me.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.207
Magic is my job.

40:31.125 --> 40:33.540
I have a bad feeling.

40:40.916 --> 40:44.499
I wouldn't stay in the ocean
when you're on land.

40:45.666 --> 40:47.082
Stop worrying.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.290
Let go of me!

40:52.583 --> 40:55.665
I want to see the ocean you're going in!

41:23.416 --> 41:27.790
We're coming to you "live"
from Shiretoko, Hokkaido.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.082
Ryu, the genius magician,

41:45.208 --> 41:50.082
Will get tied up and escape
from a box sunk in the sea.

41:50.125 --> 41:52.207
It's a new magic feat.

41:53.541 --> 41:54.790
Ryu!

41:58.666 --> 42:01.582
She is the girl I love most in this world.

42:06.416 --> 42:10.665
This watch my father gave me isn't waterproof.

42:12.875 --> 42:18.124
Hold on to it and put it on me when I return.

42:22.458 --> 42:23.707
Okay?

42:41.958 --> 42:44.665
Ryu's arms are being shackled.

42:45.166 --> 42:48.874
He can no longer move his hands.

42:49.208 --> 42:52.624
Can he really escape from the ocean?

42:53.791 --> 42:54.957
I love you.

42:57.916 --> 42:59.957
The box is being locked.

43:01.125 --> 43:06.957
The box gets lifted,
Mercilessly tearing apart the couple.

43:07.458 --> 43:12.415
It is headed for the frigid,
midnight sea of Okhotsk.

43:13.166 --> 43:16.040
Will this be an eternal farewell?

43:16.833 --> 43:18.790
The box is in the water.

43:19.208 --> 43:23.832
Water is flooding inside,
and Ryu is now submerged.

43:24.166 --> 43:29.207
Now the box with Ryu
has been swallowed by the sea.

43:37.916 --> 43:41.582
Ryu's heart monitor is on display.

43:41.625 --> 43:46.165
His pulse is proof that he is alive.

43:46.541 --> 43:50.540
The saw has now come in contact with the wire.

43:51.125 --> 43:52.999
There are sparks flying.

44:00.541 --> 44:02.624
The monitor has turned off.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.915
What has happened?
The spectators are in shock.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.165
Ryu! Ryu!

44:09.791 --> 44:11.832
Please stop!

44:49.875 --> 44:54.915
Listening to her story,
It felt as if it happened to me.

44:55.708 --> 44:59.707
Does she really believe that I'm Ryu?

45:02.625 --> 45:05.540
This is where you disappeared.

45:06.166 --> 45:07.624
Don't you remember?

46:13.000 --> 46:18.457
Hokkaido has the lowest latitude
for places with drift ice.

46:18.666 --> 46:22.165
You don't have to go all the way to Alaska.

46:23.041 --> 46:26.540
The weather is sunny while there is drift ice.

46:26.625 --> 46:30.374
The ice prevents evaporation

46:30.375 --> 46:32.665
and clouds don't form.

46:44.458 --> 46:48.457
That's how you kissed me right here.

46:50.583 --> 46:54.040
There was a man there taking a picture of us.

46:55.416 --> 46:58.832
Hey. We meet here again.

46:59.500 --> 47:01.040
I thought I'd see you,

47:01.041 --> 47:05.040
So I printed the picture I took before.

47:05.625 --> 47:06.832
Here.

47:08.625 --> 47:11.665
Well? Nice picture, huh?

47:13.125 --> 47:16.582
Nobody can take a better picture than that.

47:19.166 --> 47:21.790
Aren't you going to kiss her today?

47:23.833 --> 47:25.832
I already did.

47:25.916 --> 47:28.665
Damn. I was too late.

47:29.625 --> 47:30.915
Goodbye

47:42.333 --> 47:47.499
You told me that you like cold lips.

49:20.125 --> 49:22.374
Hey, where are we going?

49:22.708 --> 49:24.707
You forgot my brother?

49:24.791 --> 49:26.832
He's in a facility for autism

49:26.833 --> 49:29.082
and I'm late seeing him.

49:46.666 --> 49:48.374
The security is tight.

49:59.625 --> 50:02.665
He flipped up nurses' skirts 9 times.

50:02.833 --> 50:06.749
He set up a camera in the ladies' room 6 times.

50:06.875 --> 50:11.540
He's also used Kojiro's false teeth
as tongs and castanets.

50:11.875 --> 50:15.415
One time,
he even cut Mayumi's cane in half.

50:15.875 --> 50:19.707
Ryoma is seriously hopeless.

50:19.875 --> 50:21.540
You will grow to love me.

50:21.750 --> 50:23.540
You're not funny.

50:27.083 --> 50:29.332
How will you help me escape?

50:31.958 --> 50:33.707
Ryu is a magician,

50:33.708 --> 50:37.332
so he can let you meet Haruka Ayase.

50:37.916 --> 50:39.207
Haruka Ayase?

50:39.791 --> 50:44.082
Haruka Ayase is filming by the Sapporo TV Tower.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.290
I'll take you there.

50:46.791 --> 50:49.082
I signed you up as an extra.

50:51.250 --> 50:53.832
I won't just be in Haruka's movie.

50:54.250 --> 50:55.832
I'll film her acting

50:55.833 --> 50:59.165
and edit it into a movie featuring me.

50:59.166 --> 51:00.790
That's my plan.

51:07.500 --> 51:08.665
Watch carefully.

51:15.250 --> 51:17.957
It's gone. Where did it go?

51:21.166 --> 51:24.290
Now, I'll show you a trick where I disappear.

51:24.375 --> 51:27.582
Everyone turn around and count to ten.

51:29.125 --> 51:30.624
Please turn around.

51:33.041 --> 51:35.790
One, two, three...

51:36.458 --> 51:39.624
Four, five, six...

51:39.875 --> 51:43.915
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

51:46.458 --> 51:48.207
He's gone.

51:48.625 --> 51:52.707
What? The filming location changed?
Tell me why.

51:53.250 --> 51:57.165
If the flight was cancelled,
Take a train, idiot!

51:57.500 --> 51:59.332
What? Who am I?

51:59.541 --> 52:00.874
I'm an extra!

52:00.958 --> 52:04.207
I waited an hour to star with Haruka!

52:04.458 --> 52:06.499
You think a Web notice will do?

52:06.500 --> 52:10.374
I'm allergic to Internet,
So someone else registered me!

52:10.416 --> 52:11.457
Go to hell!

52:11.458 --> 52:13.707
What? "You go to hell"?

52:13.916 --> 52:17.290
Damn it. Is that all you got?

52:17.375 --> 52:18.832
I'll tell Haruka about this

52:18.833 --> 52:21.540
and get you fired!

52:23.750 --> 52:25.540
He hung up.

52:25.666 --> 52:27.790
No one answered to begin with.

52:28.458 --> 52:29.832
Is that so?

52:59.875 --> 53:03.707
You're going to do my sis, right?
Or have you already?

53:03.791 --> 53:06.082
How could you say that?

53:06.375 --> 53:09.040
I speak the truth. Stay out of this.

53:09.458 --> 53:10.957
I asked Ryu.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.124
Can you calculate this?

53:13.166 --> 53:17.499
234,567 x 67,899

53:19.500 --> 53:22.957
Why are you asking me?
You're holding a calculator.

53:23.250 --> 53:26.665
What day of the week was April 3, 1 986?

53:27.041 --> 53:28.332
Monday.

53:28.333 --> 53:29.665
Wrong.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.624
One in seven chances.

53:31.833 --> 53:35.707
Ask me again, the odds should be good.

53:49.541 --> 53:51.207
Ta-dah!

53:58.791 --> 54:03.957
So the magic trick
from 4 hours ago finally ended?

54:06.750 --> 54:08.499
I get it.

54:08.916 --> 54:10.624
There's something on you.

54:14.333 --> 54:16.124
Thank you for today.

54:16.708 --> 54:17.790
Huh?

54:21.291 --> 54:22.499
You scared me!

54:22.666 --> 54:25.707
Ryu, doesn't my sister look tasty?

54:25.875 --> 54:27.999
Do her tonight! Got it?

54:28.583 --> 54:31.582
Ryoma! That's enough!

55:11.041 --> 55:15.332
I wasn't Ryu, but was she Yuri?

55:16.791 --> 55:18.790
I don't understand any of it...

55:51.500 --> 55:52.624
Ryu?

55:54.000 --> 55:55.290
Ryu?

55:56.250 --> 55:57.874
Where are you?

56:00.958 --> 56:03.790
Don't tell me that was a dream.

56:45.041 --> 56:45.749
Right now

56:45.750 --> 56:49.582
there's someone in Japan
who looks exactly like me.

56:53.041 --> 56:55.957
I can't be as happy as her.

56:58.291 --> 57:01.415
If I die, can I become her?

57:33.458 --> 57:35.124
Have you forgotten me?

57:35.916 --> 57:38.207
I met you before.

57:38.458 --> 57:40.540
I'm Ryo. I dated Yuri.

57:41.625 --> 57:43.457
That's right.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.374
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

57:48.375 --> 57:49.707
I...

57:50.833 --> 57:51.999
I saw Yuri.

57:53.791 --> 57:54.999
In Sapporo.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.957
I'm sorry.

57:57.666 --> 58:00.457
I'm truly sorry.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.040
I'm her aunt.

58:05.666 --> 58:08.040
I'm her only relative.

58:09.375 --> 58:10.499
She had...

58:11.416 --> 58:13.582
Severe depression.

58:15.041 --> 58:20.582
In Sapporo, she lost the man
she was going to marry.

58:21.291 --> 58:26.165
She was suffering, and I brought her to Tokyo.

58:27.791 --> 58:29.124
Then...

58:30.250 --> 58:34.124
When her depression was getting much better,

58:34.666 --> 58:36.749
She met you.

58:37.333 --> 58:42.082
She dated you by the name of Yuri.

58:42.666 --> 58:45.665
She tried to forget that she was Aya.

58:46.666 --> 58:51.040
However, her guilt grew stronger...

58:52.708 --> 58:57.374
Thinking that her boyfriend in Sapporo
may be alive.

58:57.875 --> 59:00.790
She started to have suicidal thoughts.

59:01.166 --> 59:03.749
I had no choice.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.332
So once again...

59:07.125 --> 59:10.957
I sent her back to Sapporo.

59:11.916 --> 59:16.040
So you told me she died?

59:16.791 --> 59:18.249
As it turned out...

59:19.583 --> 59:22.457
After she returned to Sapporo,

59:22.791 --> 59:25.749
She forgot about her time in Tokyo

59:25.750 --> 59:28.040
like she lost her memory.

59:28.833 --> 59:30.665
She forgot everything.

59:31.750 --> 59:32.832
That's why.

59:33.375 --> 59:37.874
The girl named Yuri is as good as dead.

59:40.041 --> 59:41.707
I'm...

59:43.833 --> 59:46.124
I'm so sorry.

01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:23.624
"First Prize. Congratulations Ryo Murayama!"

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.082
Great to see you again.

01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:47.249
I decided to become a magician

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.499
because of the trick you showed me.

01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:51.790
Please teach me.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.915
Now... I'm no longer a magician.

01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:59.707
You would become a great magician.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:05.290
But a magician shall not rely only on technique.

01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:09.832
As you say, instead of using cheap tricks,

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.290
I want to learn true magic.

01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:15.957
True magic cannot be taught.

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:18.332
It is something spiritual.

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:21.457
For example, the life of Christ.

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:28.374
He fed thousands with
five loaves of bread and two fish.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:33.415
Did he really feed all of them?

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:37.957
Perhaps he gave them the illusion

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:40.332
That they were full without actually eating.

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:42.957
That they were full without actually eating.

01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:47.999
It was magic, that only Christ knew about.

01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:52.249
Well, about that trick you showed me...

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:54.040
The lollipop?

01:03:54.041 --> 01:03:55.124
Yes.

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:58.582
I really don't know how you did it.

01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:00.457
Want to know?

01:04:15.666 --> 01:04:18.332
If it can be explained,

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:21.582
It is no longer magic.

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:23.790
Congratulations.

01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:28.957
For winning the World Magic Competition.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.332
Please pick a card.

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:52.290
The 7 of diamonds, yes?

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:16.749
I'm such a fan. Thank you.

01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:27.207
Go ahead.

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:29.290
3 of diamonds.

01:05:30.416 --> 01:05:31.707
Show them.

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:34.374
Please come.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.582
Is this thing alright?

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:42.999
Ryo.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:51.540
This person is here to see you.

01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:52.707
You're cruel!

01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:55.624
Aya's in a mental hospital in Hokkaido.

01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:58.332
She has dissociative identity disorder.

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:00.082
You know something.

01:06:00.083 --> 01:06:03.040
Who are you? Why do you torture her?

01:06:03.083 --> 01:06:07.415
Are you Ryu? Ryo?
It's your fault she was admitted.

01:06:07.416 --> 01:06:09.957
What are you planning, idiot?!

01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:14.624
What did she do?
Why did she have to be admitted?

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:17.957
I was born dumb and autistic, but not her!

01:06:17.958 --> 01:06:20.790
It's your fault she was admitted!

01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:23.415
You ruined her life!

01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:27.124
I...

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:29.749
I left her Yuri's picture.

01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:35.124
She mistakenly thought I was Ryu.

01:06:35.708 --> 01:06:38.207
I just wanted to tell the truth.

01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:42.082
You should've never shown her.

01:06:54.875 --> 01:07:00.290
Aya Mogami became severely depressed
after her lover Ryu died.

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:06.707
Later, when she met you in Tokyo,
a new identity was created.

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:09.749
Her name was Yuri.

01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:15.124
She couldn't accept that
she loved someone besides Ryu.

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:21.624
So through her new identity as Yuri,
she could love you, Ryo.

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:29.499
But Yuri and Aya's identities existed together.

01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:34.790
She believed that her two identities
were doppelgangers.

01:07:35.375 --> 01:07:39.165
Therefore, Yuri's identity killed herself.

01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:43.290
And Aya's identity came back.

01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:48.749
However, Aya had not recovered mentally.

01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:51.540
Then she met you again in Hokkaido.

01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:56.040
She was convinced that I was Ryu.

01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.874
I imagine so.

01:07:58.916 --> 01:08:03.040
But you showed her the diary of the dead Yuri.

01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:08.249
After that, once again,

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:11.874
Pieces of Yuri started to come back.

01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:21.832
Once Yuri returned
and Ms. Mogami started to feel confused,

01:08:22.125 --> 01:08:23.957
She attempted suicide.

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:29.249
In the end, showing a desire to return to Aya

01:08:29.707 --> 01:08:32.582
Means to accept Ryu's death.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:36.165
So she's even refusing to be Aya.

01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:44.624
I found out that Aya lost her parents in a fire.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:52.124
When one becomes traumatized by a tragedy...

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:56.332
rather than overcoming extreme hardships,

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.915
They force it on a new identity.

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:03.540
The person then hides in their new identity.

01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:07.540
Which identity does she have now?

01:09:08.666 --> 01:09:09.874
I don't know.

01:09:10.957 --> 01:09:15.457
Whether she sees you as Ryu or Ryo

01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:18.499
Should reveal her identity

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.207
You may talk to her.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.249
What?

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.915
Where have you been?

01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:51.999
How could you abandon me?

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:56.790
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

01:09:58.041 --> 01:09:59.332
I...

01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:03.624
I can't be happy anymore.

01:10:05.291 --> 01:10:07.249
I can't feel her

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.499
I think she died.

01:10:15.416 --> 01:10:18.040
I, the unhappy one, should disappear.

01:10:19.291 --> 01:10:21.707
And she should live.

01:10:24.625 --> 01:10:27.082
That's the only way to happiness.

01:10:29.708 --> 01:10:31.457
The girl in Hokkaido...

01:10:34.083 --> 01:10:36.207
She died because of me.

01:10:39.333 --> 01:10:40.499
I'm

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.249
I'm so worthless.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:46.457
Yuri.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.665
It's all my fault.

01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:53.832
I should have disappeared.

01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:56.499
That's why...

01:10:57.916 --> 01:10:59.874
I took those pills.

01:11:02.416 --> 01:11:04.290
But I couldn't even die.

01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:07.082
It's too late now.

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:20.207
I want to see drift ice.

01:11:20.208 --> 01:11:24.124
Did Yuri say that? Or was it Aya?

01:11:24.708 --> 01:11:26.582
Maybe it was both.

01:11:26.666 --> 01:11:29.999
If Yuri were still alive,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.249
She might return to Aya.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.749
Excuse me. Aren't you the famous magician?

01:11:36.791 --> 01:11:39.540
You seem busy,

01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:42.415
so can I have your autograph later?

01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:23.832
First, make a loop.

01:12:25.958 --> 01:12:27.665
Tighter. Good.

01:12:29.708 --> 01:12:31.499
Tie it once again.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.582
Now step forward

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:41.624
I'll untie this in three seconds.

01:12:44.416 --> 01:12:45.957
Three, two...

01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:52.707
Thank you. You can go back now.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:03.124
Now I'd like one of you to come up
for a special trick.

01:13:07.833 --> 01:13:10.457
The young lady in front.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.790
Would you come up?

01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:30.540
What is your name?

01:13:32.958 --> 01:13:34.374
I'm Aya.

01:13:37.708 --> 01:13:40.499
Now put this mask on.

01:16:09.083 --> 01:16:11.957
We have an apology and an announcement.

01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:13.499
Due to a cave-in accident,

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.582
The Okhotsk Train for Abashiri

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.082
Will stop at Kitami station.

01:16:21.708 --> 01:16:26.832
Every year there's a festival,
and the train stops for repairs.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.207
I bet there's no accident.

01:16:30.666 --> 01:16:35.082
Maybe it's their strategy to
get tourists to the festival.

01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:38.415
Ryo.

01:16:39.916 --> 01:16:41.374
"Kitami Station"

01:16:41.375 --> 01:16:42.832
Is this déjà vu?

01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:45.290
No.

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:47.957
It's a scene from your memory.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.915
I've heard from your doctor.

01:16:51.666 --> 01:16:54.790
I know very well about my condition.

01:16:56.708 --> 01:17:00.415
Two people are living in my mind, right?

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:06.832
Don't we all have someone living inside us?

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.749
I have two identities in me as well

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:17.374
I sometimes wonder.

01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:20.999
Who I am...

01:17:22.291 --> 01:17:24.582
Does it really matter?

01:17:36.583 --> 01:17:38.207
Who should I be?

01:19:23.416 --> 01:19:26.374
You're Aya Mogami and...

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:29.040
Ryo Murayama, yes?

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:32.540
Is that supposed to be a disguise?

01:19:33.166 --> 01:19:35.457
I'm not really sure.

01:19:36.041 --> 01:19:38.124
Please go back to the hospital.

01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:42.040
You haven't recovered yet,
so you shouldn't be out.

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:47.124
Can't you use magic to disappear
or vanish them?

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:49.999
I can, but I need preparation.

01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:52.374
Maybe they'll help.

01:19:52.791 --> 01:19:54.665
I wish.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:57.415
There's ice cream.

01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:01.582
That ice cream is made from real glaciers.

01:20:02.625 --> 01:20:06.040
So the ice is thousands of years old.

01:20:06.416 --> 01:20:08.665
From before humans existed?

01:20:09.416 --> 01:20:11.540
I think so.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:17.915
I have an idea.

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:21.290
I'll show you magic.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.540
Magic where you close your eyes
while we eat glacier ice cream.

01:20:27.041 --> 01:20:28.290
Well?

01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:34.832
I feel like I have to eat this ice cream slowly.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.499
Scarfing down something thousands of years old

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:40.332
Would be a waste.

01:20:40.333 --> 01:20:42.874
In summer, you have to eat quickly,

01:20:42.916 --> 01:20:46.582
But in winter, you can slowly eat ice cream.

01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:50.082
Glacier ice cream isn't your average ice cream.

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:54.665
When I think of the age-old glaciers,
I might cry.

01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:57.832
Global warming is melting glaciers.

01:20:57.833 --> 01:21:01.707
So to put a brake on the end of the world,

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.665
Eat slowly

01:21:03.666 --> 01:21:05.249
You're right.

01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:09.082
Which do I look like?

01:21:09.833 --> 01:21:12.040
Aya or Yuri?

01:21:12.791 --> 01:21:16.040
The name doesn't matter. You are you.

01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:20.915
What was Yuri like?
Prettier than me, right?

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:24.874
Yuri is...

01:21:27.208 --> 01:21:28.540
Gone.

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:30.999
So is Aya.

01:21:33.625 --> 01:21:36.207
You're Mathilda.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.124
It doesn't work that way.

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:45.790
Because the person
who I think is Ryu calls himself Ryo.

01:21:48.458 --> 01:21:50.374
What am I supposed to do?

01:21:55.916 --> 01:21:57.290
That's enough.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:03.165
Aya or Yuri. Ryu or Ryo. Who cares?

01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:07.457
Why do you think we're dressed like this?

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:12.249
It's to get away from Ryu and Aya. So stop!

01:22:15.833 --> 01:22:20.540
I don't know who I am,
and it's hard for me too.

01:22:29.125 --> 01:22:30.290
Look at me.

01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:33.999
I don't know what Ryu was like.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:37.040
But he looked like this and you loved him.

01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:41.832
That's how Ryu and I are different.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:46.415
This Ryu guy could be dead or alive.

01:22:46.666 --> 01:22:48.707
Get him out of your head.

01:22:55.916 --> 01:22:57.540
I...

01:22:58.125 --> 01:23:00.540
I was happy on our way here.

01:23:03.291 --> 01:23:06.749
Putting on different clothes like this.

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:10.207
Made me feel different and happy.

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:13.874
But my hair will grow again.

01:23:15.916 --> 01:23:18.457
And I'll get confused too.

01:23:22.458 --> 01:23:24.207
I'm scared of that.

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:31.165
Let's

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:34.499
Let's stay like this

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:53.540
I'm going now.

01:24:24.333 --> 01:24:29.290
Oh no, you're not a criminal,
so I won't cuff you.

01:24:37.708 --> 01:24:39.624
If your hair grows,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.999
Just cut it again!

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.915
If you get confused

01:24:44.916 --> 01:24:47.790
Just remember the happy times!

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:53.165
We'll meet again

01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:58.207
I can tell. We'll meet again!

01:24:59.916 --> 01:25:04.290
Next time we meet, we're Mathilda and Leon!

01:25:07.833 --> 01:25:09.332
Got it?

01:25:10.166 --> 01:25:11.624
Mathilda?

01:25:13.166 --> 01:25:15.707
Yeah, Leon!

01:25:18.958 --> 01:25:21.582
Good job, Aya.

01:26:14.583 --> 01:26:15.999
Can you go faster?

01:26:16.625 --> 01:26:18.957
Is it okay that I'm speeding?

01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:21.165
Be quiet!

01:26:22.375 --> 01:26:24.290
Don't ruin the mood!

01:26:25.208 --> 01:26:26.415
I'm sorry.

01:27:02.583 --> 01:27:03.915
Look there.

01:27:07.458 --> 01:27:09.582
"Bye, Mathilda. Until next time."

01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:41.249
I heard she was discharged from the hospital.

01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:45.832
The doctor said there could be
a recurrence anytime.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.582
So that I won't confuse her anymore,

01:28:51.166 --> 01:28:54.707
I must become Ryu and not Ryo.

01:28:55.583 --> 01:28:58.040
That's what she wants.

01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:04.082
Goethe and Edgar Allan Poe
had doppelgangers too.

01:29:05.208 --> 01:29:07.957
But neither died.

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:10.457
Why is that?

01:29:11.416 --> 01:29:14.165
Because their souls synchronized.

01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:17.374
How so?

01:29:17.375 --> 01:29:18.582
Well...

01:29:19.875 --> 01:29:21.832
I will never tell you

01:29:22.458 --> 01:29:25.415
If I meet your doppelganger, I'll ask him.

01:29:25.666 --> 01:29:27.749
He won't tell you either.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.332
Because he has the same personality as me.

01:29:31.625 --> 01:29:32.707
Right?

01:29:45.416 --> 01:29:49.874
This drink is from my doppelganger.

01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:59.749
My doppelganger says thank you.

01:32:23.916 --> 01:32:25.665
It smells like Aya.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:29.707
Aya must be waiting for his return.

01:32:31.666 --> 01:32:33.665
Jealousy grows inside me.

01:33:25.083 --> 01:33:28.582
I want to see the ocean you're going in!

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:55.707
Like Houdini, he got the key from her kiss.

01:33:57.791 --> 01:34:02.290
Then there's no reason he couldn't have escaped.

01:34:13.625 --> 01:34:16.540
I will wait for my other self.

01:34:18.125 --> 01:34:19.957
My other self?

01:34:22.041 --> 01:34:24.082
That has to be me.

01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:27.790
He's waiting for me?

01:34:29.166 --> 01:34:30.499
Damn it.

01:34:33.083 --> 01:34:37.582
In his notebook was a perfectly
planned escape magic.

01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:40.874
However, he disappeared.

01:34:42.208 --> 01:34:46.790
He chose this place
because the water suddenly gets deep.7

01:34:48.875 --> 01:34:49.915
Alright.

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.249
I'll come see you.

01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:54.540
Then the assistants come...

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:17.249
He received the key along with her kiss.

01:35:17.666 --> 01:35:22.207
If it were me,
I'd want another kiss after coming back.

01:35:23.583 --> 01:35:26.624
Who am I supposed to get the key from?

01:35:57.875 --> 01:36:01.915
Known as the second Ryu, or his doppelganger,

01:36:02.291 --> 01:36:05.749
Ryo has taken the world of magic by storm

01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:10.082
He will try to reenact Ryu's escape magic

01:36:10.541 --> 01:36:14.999
which Ryu performed in Shiretoko,
Hokkaido 4 years ago.

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:20.499
It is a dangerous trick where he will be tied up
and sunk in the sea...

01:36:20.958 --> 01:36:23.374
- Are you Aya Mogami?
- Yes.

01:36:23.583 --> 01:36:26.040
This is for you. Thank you.

01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:11.999
No.

01:37:12.583 --> 01:37:15.082
This doesn't leave things to fate.

01:37:15.625 --> 01:37:17.957
I said I wouldn't go see him.

01:37:23.708 --> 01:37:25.332
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:29.207
Were you going to buy a ticket to Abashiri?

01:37:32.041 --> 01:37:34.540
Go ahead and use mine.

01:37:36.333 --> 01:37:40.832
My baby was due soon,
so I was going to pray for a safe birth.

01:37:41.541 --> 01:37:43.999
But I just got word

01:37:44.208 --> 01:37:47.415
that a cute, healthy girl was born.

01:37:48.583 --> 01:37:51.499
So I won't be needing this anymore.

01:37:54.916 --> 01:37:57.249
I'll gladly use it.

01:37:57.416 --> 01:37:58.957
Thank you.

01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:01.749
I'm happy for your baby.

01:38:02.083 --> 01:38:04.082
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

01:38:05.125 --> 01:38:06.332
The train will leave.

01:38:09.708 --> 01:38:10.999
Take care.

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.415
The Okhotsk Train for Abashiri

01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:44.915
will stop at Kitami Station for 30 seconds.

01:38:45.291 --> 01:38:50.165
If you are getting off,
please check your belongings.

01:39:18.416 --> 01:39:20.499
We're coming to you live footage from

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.665
the northern end of Japan, Utoro in Shiretoko.

01:39:25.666 --> 01:39:28.832
The genius magician Ryo, is about to

01:39:29.083 --> 01:39:33.457
try to escape from a sunken box
after being tied up.

01:39:33.625 --> 01:39:36.249
The stage is now lit up.

01:39:36.333 --> 01:39:38.332
What a glamorous stage.

01:39:54.666 --> 01:39:58.790
4 years ago,
the magician Ryu attempted the same magic,

01:39:59.125 --> 01:40:02.332
but never returned from this ocean.

01:40:03.166 --> 01:40:05.457
And now...

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:09.832
Ryo, known as Ryu's doppelganger,
will take attempt the same challenge.

01:40:11.833 --> 01:40:16.207
The men are wrapping
heavy chains around his body,

01:40:16.625 --> 01:40:18.874
and cuffing his hands.

01:40:19.791 --> 01:40:22.249
A great challenge lies ahead,

01:40:22.291 --> 01:40:26.874
yet Ryo is keeping his calm
and confident composure.

01:40:41.416 --> 01:40:44.332
Ryo is now tied in chains,

01:40:44.666 --> 01:40:47.290
and is being lifted above the box.

01:40:48.166 --> 01:40:49.957
It is a transparent coffin

01:40:49.958 --> 01:40:52.040
an elevator to the seabed.

01:40:52.833 --> 01:40:54.290
- Stop.
- Leon!

01:40:55.708 --> 01:40:56.832
Mathilda.

01:41:49.958 --> 01:41:55.290
Ryo's body, shackled in chains,
is lowered into the box.

01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:01.457
Is it really possible to escape
from the ocean like this?

01:42:07.791 --> 01:42:11.457
The box housing Ryo has been shut.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.624
There is no turning back.

01:46:14.625 --> 01:46:16.790
You finally came to see me.

01:46:22.791 --> 01:46:26.040
I've waited here for you all this time.

01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:45.832
I believed that you would come for me.

01:46:46.083 --> 01:46:49.207
You probably didn't know of me,

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:52.832
but I knew about you for a long time.

01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:58.749
In two contrasting environments
of Sapporo and Tokyo,

01:46:59.375 --> 01:47:01.749
you and I had lived.

01:47:02.125 --> 01:47:06.915
Then one day, your environment
became visible to me.

01:47:07.125 --> 01:47:10.665
It was something like déjà vu.

01:47:30.250 --> 01:47:33.707
I was able to see your future.

01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:38.499
That you would meet Aya and fall in love.

01:47:41.041 --> 01:47:45.249
In my déjà vu, I couldn't see my future.

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:48.832
It was only you and Aya I saw.

01:47:50.333 --> 01:47:54.124
I saw what had not yet happened
between you and Aya.

01:47:55.958 --> 01:47:59.874
I learned that I would cease to exist soon.

01:48:00.333 --> 01:48:04.124
If one of two doppelgangers must die...

01:48:05.041 --> 01:48:06.999
I was the one.

01:48:12.625 --> 01:48:18.290
If you would love
everything I possessed and loved,

01:48:19.375 --> 01:48:22.415
I decided to gladly take my own life.

01:48:23.458 --> 01:48:24.957
And then...

01:48:25.541 --> 01:48:28.582
I threw myself away to become you.

01:48:30.208 --> 01:48:35.540
From now on,
so that I can live in your mind and body...

01:48:36.291 --> 01:48:38.665
open the door to your soul.

01:48:39.375 --> 01:48:43.790
And then love everything I ever have...

01:48:45.583 --> 01:48:46.915
including her.

01:49:43.916 --> 01:49:46.624
Something is going on at sea.

01:49:46.833 --> 01:49:48.624
I can see someone.

01:49:48.625 --> 01:49:51.374
Someone is being pulled up...

01:49:51.375 --> 01:49:54.290
It's Ryo! He did it!

01:49:54.666 --> 01:49:57.665
The great magician has returned alive.

01:49:58.208 --> 01:50:03.624
Ryo has come back to us
from the bottom of the ocean.

01:50:04.708 --> 01:50:06.999
The crowd is going wild.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.624
There is a thunderous applause,
and some are even crying.

01:50:12.041 --> 01:50:14.749
These of course must be tears of joy.

01:50:15.333 --> 01:50:20.665
Ryo has just returned to the stage once again.

01:50:27.208 --> 01:50:28.582
Leon!

01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:32.165
Leon!

01:50:35.291 --> 01:50:36.707
Mathilda.

01:51:27.916 --> 01:51:29.665
From now on...

01:51:30.291 --> 01:51:35.290
I will exist between you
and her as the emotion of love.

01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:47.124
I have just become one with you.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.874
Edgar Allan Poe had a doppelganger too.

01:51:59.916 --> 01:52:01.624
But he didn't die.

01:52:02.208 --> 01:52:05.457
There are many ways for both to live.

01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:08.207
Just look at me.

01:52:09.208 --> 01:52:11.874
What if there was someone you loved?

01:52:13.125 --> 01:52:17.249
What if both of you loved the same woman?

01:52:20.458 --> 01:52:22.374
I...

01:52:24.916 --> 01:52:28.457
I would choose to exist in her heart.

01:54:12.916 --> 01:54:14.499
How did you do it?

01:54:15.416 --> 01:54:17.665
A magical piece of ice.

01:54:19.833 --> 01:54:21.582
It's a magic trick...

01:54:25.125 --> 01:54:26.790
created by God.
