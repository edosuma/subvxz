WEBVTT

00:26.493 --> 00:29.629
(grand trumpet music)

00:43.476 --> 00:45.012
(cows mooing)

00:45.046 --> 00:47.480
(upbeat mandolin music)

00:47.514 --> 00:48.481
Tucker: Ah, look at us.

00:48.515 --> 00:52.153
My beloved and me bound together
by art and love.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.021
Ready to take on the world.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.090
How could we have known that our
quest

00:56.123 --> 00:59.726
for redemption would tear us
asunder?

00:59.759 --> 01:03.563
(grand orchestral melody)

01:03.597 --> 01:05.397
Oh, but I'm getting ahead of
myself.

01:05.432 --> 01:08.903
Long before Fargo I was just
Tucker Charlemagne,

01:08.936 --> 01:12.874
a newly minted bachelor of fine
arts in New York City.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.910
But what set me apart from my
fellow bearded

01:15.943 --> 01:20.081
caucasian alums was my
partnership with Sandrene.

01:21.048 --> 01:25.652
I'll never forget the moment we
first locked eyes.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.722
I was directing a movement piece
when suddenly

01:28.755 --> 01:32.425
a shock of hay blonde hair
commanded my attention.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.527
Sandrene Rothstein from far off

01:34.561 --> 01:37.932
North Dakota with dreams of TV
stardom.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.733
She was doing research for a
role

01:39.766 --> 01:42.636
in a new detective show, "Rookie
Badge."

01:42.669 --> 01:45.940
From there began a romance
punctuated by a whirlwind

01:45.973 --> 01:49.709
of Shakespearian performances
throughout the boroughs.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.113
But when Rookie Badge finally
aired they had

01:52.146 --> 01:54.815
brutally cut out nearly her
entire part.

01:54.849 --> 01:56.583
Sandrene was devastated.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.985
So I invited her to join me at

01:58.019 --> 02:00.821
the Artist Atelier Acting Studio
under

02:00.855 --> 02:04.225
legendary acting teacher Buford
Schlesinger.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.960
-: I have only two notes.

02:05.993 --> 02:10.997
One, a working actress must
always carry a fan.

02:11.265 --> 02:14.734
And two, if you wanna make it in
this business

02:14.768 --> 02:18.873
you've got to immediately lose
10 pounds.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.042
Tucker: Buford forged us in the
flames

02:21.075 --> 02:22.475
of the avant-garde.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.778
Sadly, a chronic battle with
gout left him

02:24.812 --> 02:26.948
wheelchair bound and he
nominated

02:26.981 --> 02:30.051
Sandrene and me as his
successors, instructing us

02:30.084 --> 02:33.787
to devise our premiere
performance.

02:33.821 --> 02:34.788
I can see it now.

02:34.822 --> 02:38.525
3 AM atop a derelict warehouse
in The Bronx.

02:38.558 --> 02:41.228
We had a packed house plus a
comped ticket

02:41.262 --> 02:43.931
for Jax Winn, lead theater
critic

02:43.965 --> 02:47.734
of the Black Box Chronicle.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.070
-: Let's knock them dead.

02:49.103 --> 02:49.937
-: Yeah.

02:49.971 --> 02:51.671
-: David!

02:51.705 --> 02:52.739
(gong rings)

02:52.772 --> 02:53.874
(meditative chanting)

02:53.908 --> 02:55.142
Tucker OC: The stage was set for
us

02:55.176 --> 02:58.279
to unveil our signature
innovation.

02:58.312 --> 03:01.648
The Immersive Theater Attack.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.551
A thrusting of the audience into
the performance

03:04.584 --> 03:07.021
with the power to jolt
theatergoers

03:07.054 --> 03:09.023
out of their comfort zone.

03:09.056 --> 03:12.059
Actors: Immersive Theater
Attack!

03:14.895 --> 03:18.598
-: How slow this old moon
wanes...

03:18.631 --> 03:22.269
-: Four nights will quickly
dream away the time,

03:22.303 --> 03:24.537
And then the moon shall behold

03:24.571 --> 03:27.875
the night of our solemnities.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.910
Tucker OC: For a moment it
seemed as though

03:29.944 --> 03:33.014
Sandrene and I were on the edge
of a new dawn.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.748
(rhythmic drumming)

03:34.781 --> 03:37.584
(actors hooting)

03:44.025 --> 03:46.659
-: Awake the nimble spirit of
mirth!

03:46.693 --> 03:49.997
Turn melancholy forth to
funerals!

03:50.031 --> 03:52.599
Tucker OC: But as quickly as it
began,

03:52.632 --> 03:55.236
so did it abruptly end.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.939
(Sandrene gasps)

03:58.973 --> 03:59.974
-: Oh.

04:00.007 --> 04:00.841
-: Nana?

04:00.875 --> 04:01.976
-: My god.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.179
Tucker OC: I can still hear Jax
Winn's damning words.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.613
-: Don't write that down.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.816
-: "The tragic death of theater
patron

04:08.849 --> 04:11.252
"Doris Feinstein overshadowed

04:11.285 --> 04:13.720
"an otherwise scattershot
production."

04:13.753 --> 04:14.687
-: Scattershot?

04:14.721 --> 04:16.223
David: "From The Confidential
Collective."

04:16.257 --> 04:18.192
-: It's not my fault that Jax
Winn can't see

04:18.225 --> 04:20.995
that such a "tragedy" is
precisely what

04:21.028 --> 04:23.064
an immersive theater attack is
all about.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.198
-: You monster!

04:24.231 --> 04:26.167
-: What Tucker is trying to say
is that

04:26.200 --> 04:29.170
we are so, so sorry for your
loss.

04:29.203 --> 04:34.108
And we promise that such a
tragedy will never happen again.

04:35.376 --> 04:40.014
-: Yes, it was a once in a
lifetime anomaly.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.315
-: Oh really?

04:41.348 --> 04:43.084
From our very first workshop
where

04:43.117 --> 04:46.287
you forced us to use real guns!

04:46.320 --> 04:49.323
-: To adding unstimulated sexual
intercourse with each other.

04:49.356 --> 04:52.293
-: To last night, when Asher's
Nana, and by the way,

04:52.326 --> 04:55.029
our only source of funding,
died.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.833
-: After she lived as she never
had before!

04:58.866 --> 05:01.235
-: I have here an official
petition,

05:01.268 --> 05:03.137
from the members of the
"Artist's Atelier

05:03.170 --> 05:05.272
"Presents The Confidential
Collective,"

05:05.306 --> 05:09.243
demanding that Tucker and
Sandrene step down.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.811
-: Judas!

05:10.845 --> 05:13.380
Buford, surely you must
appreciate

05:13.414 --> 05:16.016
the divine influences at work
here.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.852
Our production's birth.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.652
Nana's death.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.721
It's the circle of life.

05:21.754 --> 05:25.192
-: Don't patronize me, young
man.

05:26.093 --> 05:31.298
I must respect the will of The
Collective.

05:32.333 --> 05:37.704
You two are hereby banned from
all outreach activities.

05:38.506 --> 05:41.041
-: Not the Artist's Atelier
Prison Unit.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.743
Without a working knowledge of
iambic pentameter

05:43.776 --> 05:46.447
they'll never be able to reenter
society!

05:46.480 --> 05:50.151
-: Due to your extreme
recklessness,

05:50.184 --> 05:54.288
I have no choice but to award
leadership

05:54.321 --> 05:57.925
of The Collective into the hands
of David.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.061
-: No!
-: No!

06:02.296 --> 06:03.931
-: Squire, please escort these
two

06:03.964 --> 06:05.698
out of the rehearsal studio.

06:05.732 --> 06:06.467
-: Cowards!

06:06.500 --> 06:07.301
Conformists!

06:07.334 --> 06:08.402
Sandrene: Darling, let's just
go.

06:08.435 --> 06:11.906
-: No no, we will remount our
rooftop spectacular

06:11.939 --> 06:16.110
and it will shake this town to
its very core!

06:16.143 --> 06:19.712
(dramatic music)

06:19.746 --> 06:23.450
-: Okay Tucker, they're in the
elevator, so please be nice.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.752
If we want to remount the show
we need their money.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.087
-: Well how am I supposed to
impress them when

06:27.121 --> 06:29.957
the injera hasn't even had a
chance to leaven?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.725
-: Nobody forced you to make an
Ethiopian feast from scratch.

06:32.759 --> 06:33.994
-: Well why don't we just open
up a couple cans

06:34.028 --> 06:35.863
of baked beans and throw them
into

06:35.896 --> 06:38.265
a Home Depot bucket and call it
a day?

06:38.299 --> 06:39.200
Bob: We're here!

06:39.233 --> 06:41.835
Where's our little celeb?

06:41.869 --> 06:42.503
Sandrene: Mom!

06:42.536 --> 06:43.804
-: Hi sweetie.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.106
-: Daddy.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.508
-: There's our girl.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.442
-: Hey hey hey!

06:48.475 --> 06:49.742
-: Look at your hair.

06:49.776 --> 06:50.777
Is it yours?

06:50.811 --> 06:51.445
-: Mom.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.779
-: There's the big boy!

06:52.813 --> 06:53.814
-: Tucker, hi!

06:53.847 --> 06:55.316
-: Hey, hello.

06:55.349 --> 06:56.183
Bob: Tuck!

06:56.217 --> 06:57.384
-: I love your costume.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.254
-: Oh actually it is a
traditional robe

07:00.287 --> 07:02.256
pilfered from the tomb of one of
the last

07:02.289 --> 07:06.026
known relatives of Alexander
the... Good.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.361
-: Okay.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.495
Well here.

07:08.529 --> 07:12.132
I brought you this fresh sack of
homemade bison jerky.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.235
-: Oh, you shouldn't have.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.870
Bison.

07:16.904 --> 07:17.805
-: Go on.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.273
Tuck, take a pull.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.541
-: Daddy, we're vegans now.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.476
Remember that documentary I sent
you?

07:22.509 --> 07:26.180
-: Yeah, well it's not meat,
it's jerky.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.881
Go on, take a bite.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.550
-: You know what?

07:29.583 --> 07:34.488
I am going to save this and dive
into it later.

07:35.322 --> 07:39.126
-: I'll be offended if you don't
try it.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.195
-: Well I'd hate to offend you.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.795
I shall

07:43.864 --> 07:45.933
"Take a pull" as you say.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.435
-: You're so bad.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.874
-: There you go!

07:53.907 --> 07:55.809
Put some hair on your chest.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.178
You're getting that nice smokey
mesquite!

07:58.212 --> 08:01.115
-: I can taste it in the...

08:01.148 --> 08:02.016
In the...

08:03.217 --> 08:04.218
The tendons.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.987
-: What time's the performance?

08:07.021 --> 08:08.222
-: Oh yeah, what did you guys

08:08.255 --> 08:10.224
transform into theater this
time?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.459
Is it another public restroom in
Prospect Park?

08:12.493 --> 08:14.094
Because we came prepared.

08:14.128 --> 08:16.230
(Deirdre laughs)

08:16.263 --> 08:17.865
-: Well about that.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.167
-: The production is...

08:21.902 --> 08:24.538
Being retooled.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.307
-: Oh geez, how come?

08:27.641 --> 08:31.245
-: We decided to leave our
theater company.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.846
-: So there's no show?

08:32.880 --> 08:37.384
-: Well we are gonna remount the
rooftop show on our own.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.087
But you know, first we're gonna
need

08:41.121 --> 08:43.090
some additional funding before
we can do--

08:43.123 --> 08:44.058
-: Ha!

08:44.091 --> 08:44.925
I told you!

08:44.958 --> 08:46.360
-: You did, Bob, you did.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.228
-: That they couldn't make it
through to dessert.

08:48.262 --> 08:51.932
-: Daddy please, we've been
working on this for four years.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.635
It'll literally make our
reputation in New York.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.071
We wouldn't ask for anything
ever again.

08:57.104 --> 08:57.938
-: Ever again.

08:57.971 --> 08:58.605
-: That's good.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.240
(Deidre and Bob laugh)

09:00.274 --> 09:02.910
-: You really are your mother's
daughter.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.347
-: Sandy, your mother and I have
been talking

09:06.380 --> 09:09.116
and we think it's high time you
two start

09:09.149 --> 09:12.019
pulling yourselves up by your
own bootstraps.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.053
(Tucker gasps)

09:13.087 --> 09:15.522
-: We are artists, Bob.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.990
Not plumbers.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.893
-: Well we have been bankrolling
this whole

09:19.927 --> 09:22.262
artist lifestyle for long
enough.

09:22.296 --> 09:26.033
So it is time to grow up and
start earning a living.

09:26.066 --> 09:31.105
Because we cannot justify this
freeloading here any longer.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.072
Got it?

09:32.106 --> 09:33.140
Let's go.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.576
We'll see if we can find one of
those halal carts.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.611
-: So what, you're just cutting
us off?

09:37.644 --> 09:41.348
-: That bison jerky's my last
handout.

09:41.382 --> 09:42.316
You hear?

09:42.349 --> 09:43.384
-: Wait, no, mommy please!

09:43.417 --> 09:44.218
-: Mommy.

09:44.251 --> 09:44.853
-: You know I don't have the
forearm

09:44.918 --> 09:47.421
strength to be a waitress.

09:49.123 --> 09:50.424
-: Well there is one thing,
but--

09:50.457 --> 09:53.394
-: No, anything mommy, please.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.028
-: You know the Fargo City
Council

09:55.062 --> 09:56.663
is revitalizing Main Street.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.664
-: Yeah.

09:57.698 --> 10:01.502
-: Well they've renovated the
Fargo Theater.

10:01.535 --> 10:03.670
And they're having a competition
next month

10:03.704 --> 10:07.908
to award a residency to one
local theater company.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.012
-: Oh Tucker, you should see the
Fargo Theater.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.113
It's so beautiful.

10:13.147 --> 10:13.981
-: Yes.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.015
-: Oh yes, wonderful.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.284
We can perform for the spillover

10:17.317 --> 10:20.053
from the local cattle auction.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.355
-: Come to Fargo.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.357
And try and win the theater.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.259
Sweetie, I think you have a
shot.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.427
And you can stay at the ranch

10:26.460 --> 10:29.329
while we're on safari in
Tanzania.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.000
Otherwise, your father's right.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.369
You can't live in fantasy land
anymore.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.304
(subway train rumbling)

10:37.337 --> 10:40.974
Conductor: Stand clear of the
closing doors please.

10:47.181 --> 10:48.048
-: Tucker?

10:50.350 --> 10:53.620
Come have a word with me at the
Atelier.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.196
Have I told you about my
off-off-Broadway

11:02.229 --> 11:05.132
production of A Doll's House

11:05.165 --> 11:07.401
Which Walter Kerr called

11:08.702 --> 11:10.537
"a neorealist's wet dream?"

11:10.571 --> 11:12.272
-: Wet dream, yeah.

11:12.306 --> 11:14.074
I wish I had been alive to see
it.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.476
I would've sat in the splash
zone.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.611
-: The first adaptation of that

11:17.644 --> 11:22.115
was devised in the jungles of
Siberia.

11:23.818 --> 11:26.520
-: I didn't know that they had
jungles in the Arctic.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.055
-: The snow.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.356
(Buford chuckles)

11:29.389 --> 11:31.358
The mosquitoes!

11:31.391 --> 11:36.430
Collaborating with comrades
toward a single goal.

11:36.463 --> 11:40.701
It made me the artist I am
today.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.303
If you're ever going to discover

11:43.337 --> 11:45.639
the true purpose of theater

11:45.672 --> 11:46.473
-: Yes.

11:46.507 --> 11:51.111
-: You must have this experience
too.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.815
-: But the New York theater is
my home.

11:53.848 --> 11:57.751
-: But you'll never understand
it until you step away

11:57.784 --> 12:01.588
to discover the true purpose of
that theater.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.658
-: I see.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.261
It's all clear to me now.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.531
-: It's all for your own good,
my boy.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.533
-: The gout has eaten its way
from your foot

12:12.566 --> 12:15.669
to your brain and infected it.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.772
-: That's medically impossible.

12:19.841 --> 12:22.109
-: King Lear would be proud.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.245
-: Tucker, you must realize.

12:25.279 --> 12:27.815
You're standing in your own way.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.387
-: Do you see this?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.188
It's literally real fake fur.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.457
I'm sure you can get tons for
it.

12:37.491 --> 12:38.392
Also this one.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.693
-: Oh my god.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.094
Sandy.

12:41.128 --> 12:41.762
-: Brian.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.629
-: Is that you?

12:42.663 --> 12:43.497
-: Brian!

12:43.530 --> 12:44.364
-: Hey.

12:44.398 --> 12:45.465
So how are you?

12:45.499 --> 12:46.400
How's it going?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.835
Who are you with?

12:47.869 --> 12:49.403
-: Oh.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.237
Tucker.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.439
No no no no, who are you repped
by?

12:52.472 --> 12:53.373
-: Oh.

12:53.407 --> 12:55.309
Oh no no, I don't have an agent.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.443
-: Really?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.378
You didn't get signed after your
Rookie Badge recurring?

12:58.412 --> 13:00.247
-: Oh no, we took over the
theater company

13:00.280 --> 13:03.517
right after that, so we've been
really busy.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.153
-: So I just got promoted to
coordinator

13:06.186 --> 13:07.889
at United Talent International.

13:07.922 --> 13:09.289
-: UTI, right.

13:09.323 --> 13:11.525
-: I'm starting to hip pocket my
own clients

13:11.558 --> 13:13.427
and I would love to send you out
on some stuff.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.661
See if anything sticks.

13:14.695 --> 13:15.495
-: Really?

13:15.529 --> 13:17.664
-: Sandrene, you are way too
legit

13:17.698 --> 13:20.701
to spend your life pawning
pashminas.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.369
Caller: You'll never perform in
this city again!

13:22.402 --> 13:23.370
(caller hangs up)

13:23.403 --> 13:24.671
-: Hello?

13:24.705 --> 13:25.572
Hello?

13:26.540 --> 13:28.308
-: Did you find us a theater?

13:28.342 --> 13:29.209
-: No.

13:30.544 --> 13:33.580
Everyone in this town thinks
we're murderers.

13:33.614 --> 13:36.483
Or, as your father's lawyer
says,

13:36.516 --> 13:38.886
"involuntary manslaughterers."

13:38.920 --> 13:40.554
-: Great.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.856
-: There's gotta be a way.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.457
What are we missing?

13:43.490 --> 13:46.226
(playful music)

13:52.599 --> 13:53.433
Sandrene.

13:54.802 --> 13:55.736
Brilliant!

13:55.769 --> 13:56.603
Brilliant!

13:56.637 --> 13:57.738
-: What?

13:57.771 --> 14:00.842
-: This face mask has particles
of 24 karat gold in it.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.542
If we chemically separate it and
melt it down

14:02.576 --> 14:03.777
into bullion, I've heard tell of
a man

14:03.811 --> 14:06.279
in Venezuela who will pay top
dollar for--

14:06.313 --> 14:06.948
-: Tucker!

14:06.981 --> 14:08.248
-: What?

14:08.281 --> 14:09.416
-: Look at us!

14:09.449 --> 14:11.652
Is this what our life is gonna
be like?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.520
-: What choice do we have?

14:13.553 --> 14:14.621
We can't get real jobs.

14:14.655 --> 14:16.657
-: Of course.
-: Of course.

14:20.828 --> 14:22.262
-: We can go to Fargo.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.497
-: Sandrene, please be serious.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.899
-: I am.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.802
The competition, the Fargo
Theater.

14:27.835 --> 14:30.470
This could be our chance to do
what we've always dreamed.

14:30.504 --> 14:34.574
-: No, I will not cast my
theatrical pearls before...
bison.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.944
-: You're missing the forest for
the trees.

14:36.978 --> 14:39.212
We wouldn't have to worry about
money.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.948
We'd live at my parents' ranch
and we'd

14:40.982 --> 14:44.584
have the freedom to make
whatever we want.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.187
Like a retreat.

14:48.422 --> 14:49.423
-: A retreat.

14:50.925 --> 14:53.861
Like the jungles of Siberia...

14:53.895 --> 14:55.328
-: There are no jungles in
Siberia.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.931
-: But nobody in Fargo would
have experience.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.365
We'd have to start from scratch.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.466
-: Exactly!

14:59.499 --> 15:03.838
We'd have a blank canvas to
create whatever we want.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.274
Also rent's due tomorrow, so
unless

15:07.307 --> 15:08.810
your gold extractor's up and
running

15:08.843 --> 15:12.312
we best start looking for a
tent.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.246
-: Oh.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.550
(upbeat mandolin music)

15:23.557 --> 15:26.493
(train bell rings)

15:35.602 --> 15:38.005
(cows mooing)

15:40.908 --> 15:42.642
Ahh, the city gates.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.880
At least we've arrived.

15:45.913 --> 15:47.014
-: Yeah, but my parents' ranch

15:47.048 --> 15:48.950
is still two miles down that
way.

15:48.983 --> 15:50.650
-: Let's go.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.719
-: We should've just stayed in
the car.

15:54.488 --> 15:57.024
Tucker: Ahh, there she blows.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.595
Sandrene: Mmm yes, the historic
Fargo Theater.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.066
-: We would be its ideal
custodians.

16:05.099 --> 16:06.500
-: Come with me.

16:09.804 --> 16:13.473
(Tucker and Sandrene gasp)

16:17.344 --> 16:19.312
-: This could be our Globe.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.982
Though, you know,

16:21.015 --> 16:23.283
Hopefully less flammable.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.889
-: I used to sneak in here.

16:27.922 --> 16:30.290
Pretend I was on Broadway.

16:31.658 --> 16:35.328
Never actually got to perform
here though.

16:37.865 --> 16:42.335
-: But soft, what light through
yonder window breaks?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.405
It is the east.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.307
And Juliet is the sun.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.011
-: Oh Romeo, Romeo.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.347
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

16:54.381 --> 16:58.019
Deny thy father and refuse thy
name.

16:58.052 --> 17:01.354
Or if thou wilt not, be but
sworn

17:01.388 --> 17:03.891
my love and I will no longer
be--

17:03.925 --> 17:05.724
Morten: Rothstein?

17:06.792 --> 17:07.627
-: Mr. Mortenson?

17:07.661 --> 17:11.031
-: Sandy Rothstein, live and in
person?

17:11.065 --> 17:12.699
Treading the boards?

17:12.732 --> 17:15.136
Oh fer cute, Sandy Rothstein.

17:15.169 --> 17:18.906
How long has it been since our
legendary drama class?

17:18.940 --> 17:20.373
You look wonderful!

17:20.406 --> 17:21.041
-: So do you.

17:21.075 --> 17:22.108
-: Thank you.

17:22.143 --> 17:24.511
-: And actually I go by my stage
name St. Jean now.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.012
-: Sandy St. Jean, I like that.

17:26.047 --> 17:27.048
-: Sandrene.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.983
-: Sandrene St. John, even
better.

17:29.016 --> 17:30.017
-: Well you came up with it.

17:30.051 --> 17:31.819
-: Well let's applaud me!

17:31.853 --> 17:32.652
(Sandrene laughs)

17:32.686 --> 17:34.155
-: Excuse me good sir, but we
were

17:34.188 --> 17:36.523
in the throes of artistic
creation.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.792
-: No no no, Tucker, this is Mr.
Mortenson.

17:38.826 --> 17:40.161
My high school drama teacher.

17:40.194 --> 17:41.461
He's the one that taught me how
to sing

17:41.494 --> 17:43.396
and dance and get rid of my
accent

17:43.430 --> 17:44.899
so I could make it in New York.

17:44.932 --> 17:45.833
-: It's true.

17:45.867 --> 17:46.934
And you are?

17:46.968 --> 17:49.036
-: Tucker Charlemagne, if you
please.

17:49.070 --> 17:51.638
-: Tucker's my fiance.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.706
-: Oh.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.075
Cute.

17:54.108 --> 17:55.508
So what are you doing home, huh?

17:55.542 --> 17:56.643
Visiting the folks?

17:56.676 --> 17:59.046
-: No, we are here to start an
artistic

17:59.080 --> 18:02.083
revolution and claim this
theater.

18:02.116 --> 18:03.516
-: I see.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.485
-: Oh, maybe you can help us
actually.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.687
We need to cast our ensemble and
Mr. Mortenson

18:07.721 --> 18:10.091
knows all the best actors in
town.

18:10.124 --> 18:11.859
-: It's true, I do.

18:11.893 --> 18:13.995
But I'm afraid they're not
available.

18:14.028 --> 18:15.562
-: Why not?

18:15.595 --> 18:18.065
-: Because they're in my
ensemble.

18:18.099 --> 18:19.499
Ensemble!

18:19.532 --> 18:21.534
(dance music)

18:21.568 --> 18:22.769
Get out here, kids.

18:22.803 --> 18:24.005
There you are.

18:24.038 --> 18:25.572
Your body is your instrument.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.042
You're a symphony, all of you.

18:28.075 --> 18:29.576
Okay, no tension.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.079
There you go, that's beautiful.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.784
You see, a lot has changed since
you left, Sandy.

18:37.818 --> 18:42.189
West Fargo High has cut the
drama department.

18:42.223 --> 18:43.057
-: What?

18:43.090 --> 18:43.757
Why?

18:43.790 --> 18:44.591
-: They used the money to buy

18:44.624 --> 18:47.460
an ice bath for the football
team.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.562
So I had to go out on my own,
build my own

18:49.596 --> 18:51.464
repertory company to perform all

18:51.498 --> 18:53.466
the classics like we used to do.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.769
And yes, there is a competition

18:55.803 --> 18:58.672
for the theater, but it's
perfunctory.

18:58.705 --> 19:02.076
The Red River Players are poised
to win.

19:02.109 --> 19:04.744
We could use an immense talent
like yours.

19:04.778 --> 19:05.980
(Tucker laughs)

19:06.013 --> 19:07.781
-: Sandrene would never betray
me.

19:07.815 --> 19:09.050
-: Tucker, please.

19:09.083 --> 19:10.985
-: There's a dearth of local
talent here.

19:11.018 --> 19:12.853
A lot of people auditioned.

19:12.887 --> 19:14.754
If you want to see the rejects,
they're all

19:14.788 --> 19:17.825
performing open mic night down
at the Sons of Norway.

19:17.858 --> 19:19.126
Sandy.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.027
You.

19:21.963 --> 19:24.764
-: And so friend becomes foe.

19:24.798 --> 19:26.633
-: Come on, I need to get a
drink.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.036
-: Norway.

19:29.070 --> 19:30.603
Ibsen, very good.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.541
(chill hip hop music)

19:40.815 --> 19:41.681
-: Good.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.219
-: Well if only we were looking

19:45.252 --> 19:47.221
for farmhands and cowpokes.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.655
-: Don't fret, darling.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.789
I'm gonna ask around.

19:49.824 --> 19:51.225
We will find our band of merry

19:51.258 --> 19:52.893
minstrels or my name isn't--

19:52.927 --> 19:54.128
Hank: Sandy?

19:55.695 --> 19:56.931
-: Oh my god, Hank!

19:56.964 --> 19:58.866
(Hank laughs)

19:58.899 --> 20:01.002
-: Look at you, Miss Thing.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.537
How long has it been, seven
years?

20:04.571 --> 20:07.707
-: Yeah, since that summer after
graduation.

20:07.741 --> 20:08.575
Sure has.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.743
-: How now?

20:09.776 --> 20:10.744
-: Tucker, this is Hank.

20:10.777 --> 20:11.879
Hank, this is Tucker.

20:11.912 --> 20:13.014
-: Her partner.

20:13.047 --> 20:15.682
Creatively, spiritually,

20:15.715 --> 20:18.886
and soon to be... matrimonially.

20:18.919 --> 20:21.654
-: And you told me you weren't
the marrying kind.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.657
-: Yeah, well a lot has changed
since high school.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.626
-: And yet here you are.

20:29.763 --> 20:30.898
(crowd applauds)

20:30.931 --> 20:31.798
-: Yes!

20:35.369 --> 20:36.470
-: Tough crowd tonight, man.

20:36.504 --> 20:40.241
-: Aw please, your music's just
lost on these fossils!

20:40.274 --> 20:41.909
-: Oi Hank, you're up.

20:41.942 --> 20:42.943
-: All right.

20:47.848 --> 20:49.183
-: Who is that hayseed?

20:49.216 --> 20:50.784
-: No, that "hayseed" is my
boyfriend

20:50.818 --> 20:51.852
from high school, remember?

20:51.886 --> 20:53.753
I told you about him many times.

20:53.787 --> 20:55.588
-: He still seems very enamoréd.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.623
-: Tuck, please.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.025
He never left Fargo.

20:58.059 --> 20:59.994
You know how that bothers me.

21:00.027 --> 21:02.063
-: You don't seem botheréd.

21:02.096 --> 21:04.832
-: Before our next act, I'm
obliged

21:04.865 --> 21:08.768
to remind you all that the Red
River Players

21:08.803 --> 21:11.338
will be presenting a medley from
their

21:11.372 --> 21:14.809
production of Pirates of
Penzance

21:14.842 --> 21:18.678
at the Fargo Theater competition
this month.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.779
Whoop de doo.

21:25.319 --> 21:28.923
Also, if you don't want to be a
part

21:28.956 --> 21:32.625
of that musical theater drivel.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.294
Dryvel?

21:33.327 --> 21:34.261
Dribble?

21:34.295 --> 21:36.263
-: Drivel, you were right the
first time.

21:36.297 --> 21:37.131
-: Drivel.

21:37.164 --> 21:38.665
Drivel, drivel.

21:38.698 --> 21:42.203
And want to join a theatrical
revolution,

21:42.236 --> 21:45.239
find the handsome couple at the
bar.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.676
And now, the man himself,
Buffalo Hank!

21:49.709 --> 21:51.078
(crowd applauds)

21:51.112 --> 21:53.314
-: His name is Buffalo Hank?

21:55.116 --> 21:56.283
-: I'm gonna start with an oldie

21:56.317 --> 21:59.719
but a goodie for a friend here
tonight.

22:00.521 --> 22:02.655
I'm gonna need her to join me to
sing it.

22:02.689 --> 22:03.991
Sandy, get up here!

22:04.024 --> 22:04.892
Come on!

22:04.925 --> 22:05.826
-: No thanks.

22:05.860 --> 22:06.894
-: Come up here.

22:06.927 --> 22:09.263
-: No no, I couldn't possibly.

22:09.296 --> 22:10.931
-: Get on up there, girl!

22:10.965 --> 22:12.366
Hank: Sandy Rothstein, get up
here!

22:12.399 --> 22:14.201
-: Okay okay, fine.

22:14.235 --> 22:16.237
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:16.270 --> 22:19.073
(crowd applauds)

22:20.141 --> 22:21.342
(acoustic guitar music)

22:21.375 --> 22:24.311
-: I think you'll recognize

boots ♪

22:26.779 --> 22:29.383

23:08.088 --> 23:10.224
(song drowns out)

23:10.257 --> 23:13.427
-: So Billy was thrown in jail,

23:13.460 --> 23:16.030
covered in puke, wearing just
the helmet.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.432
-: Hey screw you man, I still
had a flag around my waist.

23:18.465 --> 23:19.300
-: Oh yeah, the flag!

23:19.333 --> 23:20.501
(group laughs)

23:20.534 --> 23:22.870
-: Wow, sounds like quite the
funeral.

23:22.903 --> 23:23.770
-: Oh yeah.

23:27.341 --> 23:30.177
So uh, Tuck.

23:30.211 --> 23:32.346
How'd you meet Sandy?

23:32.379 --> 23:33.746
-: Tucker.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.216
Charlemagne. The First.

23:35.249 --> 23:38.751
And Sandrene and I met doing a
production

23:38.785 --> 23:42.089
of Romeo and Juliet in the park.

23:42.122 --> 23:44.191
-: Aww, Central Park?

23:44.225 --> 23:46.360
-: Thompson Square Park.

23:46.393 --> 23:48.395
It was a movement based
interpretation

23:48.429 --> 23:50.898
for the safe injection site.

23:53.100 --> 23:55.035
-: So you really think you can

23:55.069 --> 23:57.004
take on the Red River Players?

23:57.037 --> 23:59.840
I mean they've performed
indoors.

24:02.142 --> 24:06.080
-: Once I find my ensemble and
train them in the tradition

24:06.113 --> 24:10.184
of the avant-garde we will be
unstoppable.

24:10.217 --> 24:13.120
-: That what they call that
fancy scarf?

24:13.153 --> 24:14.088
"Avant-garde"?

24:14.121 --> 24:16.023
(group chuckles)

24:16.056 --> 24:17.224
How about those red pants?

24:17.258 --> 24:18.525
Are they a part of the costume?

24:18.559 --> 24:19.893
Does that help you perform?

24:19.927 --> 24:21.495
-: Oh for Pete's sake, stop it.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.330
-: No, this isn't...

24:25.532 --> 24:27.167
-: Tucker, we're razzing you,
man.

24:27.201 --> 24:28.335
We're just having fun.

24:28.369 --> 24:29.536
Billy: We're just razzing you!

24:29.570 --> 24:31.105
We're having a good time!

24:31.138 --> 24:32.206
Greta: Be sensitive.

24:32.239 --> 24:33.073
-: Beloved!

24:33.107 --> 24:36.143
(tense music)

24:36.176 --> 24:40.047
Was the hope drunk wherein you
dressed yourself?

24:40.080 --> 24:41.949
Hath it slept since?

24:41.982 --> 24:43.851
-: Immersive theater attack.

24:43.884 --> 24:47.488
-: And wakes it now to look so
green and pale,

24:50.057 --> 24:52.192
At what it did so freely?

24:54.928 --> 24:58.198
From this time, such I account

24:59.099 --> 25:00.367
Thy love.

25:00.401 --> 25:01.268
-: Oh my god.

25:01.302 --> 25:03.137
This is a flash mob.

25:03.170 --> 25:06.507
-: Art thou afeard to be the
same in thine own

25:06.540 --> 25:10.110
act and valor as thou art in
desire?

25:10.144 --> 25:12.246
Wouldst thou have that which
thou

25:12.279 --> 25:15.015
esteem'st the ornament of life,

25:15.049 --> 25:17.551
and live a coward in thine own
esteem?

25:17.584 --> 25:19.386
-: Prithee peace!

25:19.420 --> 25:22.956
I dare do all that may become a
man.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.992
Who dares do more is none.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.627
-: What beast was't then that
made you

25:26.660 --> 25:28.929
break this enterprise to me?

25:28.962 --> 25:31.832
(uplifting music)

25:40.274 --> 25:42.943
(crowd gasps)

25:42.976 --> 25:43.944
-: Hey!

25:43.977 --> 25:46.146
We don't hit our women out here!

25:46.180 --> 25:47.448
-: No no no no no!

25:47.481 --> 25:50.517
(rock music)

25:50.551 --> 25:52.086
-: It's a fight, it's a fight!

25:52.119 --> 25:54.588
-: It's stage combat, you
simpleton!

25:54.621 --> 25:55.923
Ow ow ow ow ow!

25:55.956 --> 25:56.890
Yorick: Should we call the
police?

25:56.924 --> 25:57.558
-: Go, go go go!

25:57.591 --> 25:58.459
Sandrene: Get off of him!

25:58.492 --> 25:59.326
-: Sandrene!

25:59.360 --> 26:00.294
Get him off!

26:00.327 --> 26:02.329
(Sandrene shrieks)

26:02.363 --> 26:05.532
(Tucker and Sandrene groan)

26:05.566 --> 26:08.369
(wistful music)

26:11.205 --> 26:14.942
(Tucker and Sandrene laugh)

26:29.990 --> 26:31.425
(bluesy harmonica music)

26:31.458 --> 26:33.026
-: So I hoisted up my britches,

26:33.060 --> 26:35.095
gathered my things, and
hightailed it

26:35.129 --> 26:37.498
out of the theater as fast as I
could.

26:37.531 --> 26:38.932
-: Incredible.

26:38.966 --> 26:42.336
-: But I do miss the sense of
community.

26:42.369 --> 26:47.341
-: Well our theatrical
revolution could give you a
community.

26:47.374 --> 26:48.509
-: Revolution?

26:48.542 --> 26:50.010
Oh I don't know.

26:50.744 --> 26:54.281
I'm already blacklisted in 47
States.

26:54.314 --> 26:56.383
-: Shall we make that 48?

26:56.417 --> 26:57.985
Policeman: Okay now, rise and
shine.

26:58.018 --> 26:58.652
Everybody out.

26:58.685 --> 27:02.222
(electronic door buzzes)

27:05.492 --> 27:06.660
-: Tucker, hey, hi.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.162
-: No, please, no photographs.

27:08.195 --> 27:09.530
-: No no no, we were there.

27:09.563 --> 27:10.497
Last night.

27:12.499 --> 27:13.500
Here you go.

27:14.568 --> 27:16.203
Hi, I'm Brady.

27:16.236 --> 27:18.038
This is Jack.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.674
-: What you guys did was
amazing.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.509
-: Oh yeah, when you guys got in
that fight.

27:22.543 --> 27:24.445
-: We wanna do what you guys do.

27:24.478 --> 27:27.414
And we're not the only ones.

27:27.448 --> 27:28.315
-: Jack!

27:29.183 --> 27:31.251
What are you doing here?

27:31.285 --> 27:33.554
Shouldn't you be at lacrosse
practice?

27:33.587 --> 27:36.356
-: Mom, we agreed that if I got
into

27:36.390 --> 27:38.625
a play I didn't have to do
lacrosse.

27:38.659 --> 27:41.028
-: Yes, but the Red River
Players

27:41.061 --> 27:43.163
did not see your special spark.

27:43.197 --> 27:44.998
-: Well these guys do.

27:45.799 --> 27:47.568
Radio Policeman: We got a 419 on
I-12.

27:47.601 --> 27:49.303
-: 10-4, Captain Mikkelsen
responding.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.004
I'll be there in five.

27:51.038 --> 27:52.306
Stay out of trouble.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.173
-: Yeah yeah.

27:53.207 --> 27:54.241
Okay, bye mom.

27:54.274 --> 27:56.076
Radio Policeman: Okie doke, bye
now.

28:02.082 --> 28:03.517
-: They're here!

28:03.550 --> 28:05.085
-: Hey everybody, this is Uther.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.054
He can't see you so good, so.

28:07.087 --> 28:08.021
Watch out for these chairs.

28:08.055 --> 28:08.689
-: Oh thank you.

28:08.722 --> 28:09.723
Jack: Told you they'd come.

28:09.756 --> 28:10.657
Leah: As long as they'll sign

28:10.691 --> 28:11.625
my community service forms.

28:11.658 --> 28:13.327
Yorick: Are we picking teams?

28:13.360 --> 28:15.295
-: Look at them, Sandrene.

28:15.329 --> 28:17.397
So young, so raw, so--

28:17.431 --> 28:18.699
-: Salutations everyone!

28:18.732 --> 28:19.566
-: Hello.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.268
-: They're perfect.

28:24.571 --> 28:27.608
-: Now if we are going to devise
a play

28:27.641 --> 28:30.177
that will win us that theater,
we need

28:30.210 --> 28:34.281
to assess your individual
strengths so that

28:34.314 --> 28:39.319
we may build them into our final
performance.

28:40.687 --> 28:42.456
-: So we're not going to just

28:42.489 --> 28:45.292
memorize lines and say them
good?

28:50.097 --> 28:54.568
-: The stage is where you
arrive, not where you begin.

28:54.601 --> 28:56.069
Write that down.

28:56.770 --> 28:58.405
This is obviously going to take
a while,

28:58.438 --> 29:00.340
so let's clear out a rehearsal
space.

29:00.374 --> 29:01.208
-: Wait!

29:01.241 --> 29:03.143
We can't do that in here!

29:03.176 --> 29:04.711
Lunch is in an hour.

29:06.213 --> 29:09.383
-: We need a three dimensional
sketchpad

29:09.416 --> 29:13.186
where artists can take risks,

29:13.220 --> 29:14.588
fail,

29:14.621 --> 29:17.157
and ultimately bear their open
wounds

29:17.190 --> 29:20.594
to the healing salve of artistic
creation.

29:26.466 --> 29:28.769
-: Oh, we need a room with some
open space to move around.

29:28.803 --> 29:29.469
-: Oh!

29:29.503 --> 29:31.171
-: Yes, that makes more sense.

29:31.204 --> 29:31.973
-: That's what I said.

29:32.006 --> 29:34.842
-: Well, what about the
Tankhouse?

29:34.876 --> 29:36.310
-: The what?

29:36.343 --> 29:38.779
-: It used to be the storeroom
for the lodge,

29:38.813 --> 29:41.181
but then the raccoons invaded,
so now

29:41.214 --> 29:44.418
I just use it as my Aquavit
distillery.

29:45.719 --> 29:48.221
(Uther sniffs)

29:48.255 --> 29:50.257
-: Oh, I know that smell.

29:51.391 --> 29:54.461
I squatted in here for a few
moons.

29:54.494 --> 29:58.332
Painted some self-portraits to
keep me company.

29:58.365 --> 29:59.633
(tense sting)

29:59.666 --> 30:02.369
I didn't have a mirror.

30:02.402 --> 30:03.905
-: They're very nice.

30:03.938 --> 30:05.539
(rhythmic drumming)

30:05.572 --> 30:09.409
All human progress has been in
pursuit of comfort.

30:09.443 --> 30:10.644
Well guess what?

30:10.677 --> 30:14.247
Comfort is the enemy of
creation.

30:14.281 --> 30:15.749
Therefore, partner off.

30:15.782 --> 30:18.886
One of you bend over, the other
vigorously

30:18.920 --> 30:21.521
knead your partner's tailbone.

30:22.723 --> 30:24.892
-: Get some real pressure in
there.

30:24.926 --> 30:26.760
-: Try a fist.

30:26.793 --> 30:29.429
-: I have a passion for the
technical side of theater.

30:29.463 --> 30:30.797
Absolutely definitely not

30:30.832 --> 30:33.600
the in-front-of-people side of
theater.

30:33.634 --> 30:36.503
So this is pretty much my worst
nightmare.

30:36.536 --> 30:38.171
-: Nina!

30:38.205 --> 30:40.273
Speak the speech.

30:40.307 --> 30:41.809
-: Can I please just take notes?

30:41.843 --> 30:43.710
-: It'll be so easy.

30:43.744 --> 30:47.648
The wonderful thing about Tucker
and me is we're always on

30:47.681 --> 30:49.349
-: The same page.
-: The same page.

30:49.383 --> 30:51.718
-: Mmm, yes, very often we are
thinking.

30:51.752 --> 30:54.822
-: The same thoughts.
-: The same thing.

30:55.890 --> 30:58.659
-: Whoa, nice, we got a couple
of naturals over here.

30:58.692 --> 30:59.526
-: Thank you.

30:59.559 --> 31:00.627
-: How does that feel?

31:00.661 --> 31:02.295
-: My buddy came to visit North
Dakota the other day

31:02.329 --> 31:04.364
and he was complaining about the
cold.

31:04.398 --> 31:05.666
And I said what'd you expect?

31:05.699 --> 31:08.635
It's got "coat" right in the
name!

31:08.669 --> 31:09.536
-: Ha!

31:14.876 --> 31:16.476
-: I want you to be.

31:16.510 --> 31:20.313
-: Slippery as a noodle.
-: Stiff as a board.

31:20.347 --> 31:20.982
-: Perfect technique.

31:21.015 --> 31:21.849
-: Lovely pressure.

31:21.883 --> 31:22.950
-: The point, the point.

31:22.984 --> 31:24.785
There you go, really dig in
there.

31:24.819 --> 31:26.420
Yorick: Geez Leah, ow.

31:26.453 --> 31:27.487
-: I'm Leah.

31:27.521 --> 31:29.790
I'm the founder of the militant
wing

31:29.824 --> 31:32.592
of Fargo's women's alliance The
Pink Panthers.

31:32.626 --> 31:36.363
Every month I bleed in a cycle,
I howl at the moon!

31:36.396 --> 31:38.665
(Leah howls)

31:38.699 --> 31:41.501
(group applauds)

31:44.738 --> 31:45.873
-: Like a bolt of lighting!

31:45.907 --> 31:46.908
-: Swimming in noodles-

31:46.941 --> 31:47.942
-: Shooting up your spine-

31:47.975 --> 31:49.811
-: Whether 'tis nobler...

31:49.844 --> 31:52.412
-: I didn't really fit in as a
kid.

31:52.446 --> 31:54.414
The more I got into history,

31:54.448 --> 31:57.684
the more I realized my true
identity.

31:57.718 --> 32:00.687
I am the reincarnated Sweyn
Forkbeard.

32:00.721 --> 32:02.522
And the Tankhouse is a great

32:02.556 --> 32:05.325
outlet for my warrior
tendencies.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.961
-: Okay, all right, let's go
over this one more time.

32:06.994 --> 32:09.463
It's called "stage combat" so
that

32:09.496 --> 32:12.365
you don't actually have to hit
me.

32:13.767 --> 32:15.803
See, you did it again...

32:17.771 --> 32:19.306
(Nina sobbing)

32:19.339 --> 32:20.707
-: Take five!

32:20.741 --> 32:21.943
-: I think we're really getting
somewhere.

32:21.976 --> 32:26.346
-: Ever since my ill-fated
attempt at DIY laser eye
surgery,

32:26.379 --> 32:29.917
I have mastered the scent-driven
lifestyle.

32:30.717 --> 32:35.589
I am the master of my body in
space!

32:36.590 --> 32:38.025
-: Watch out, watch out!

32:38.059 --> 32:38.926
-: My mead!

32:40.794 --> 32:43.064
-: That was a choice.

32:43.097 --> 32:46.366
♪ You've got no idea what I'm
feeling ♪

32:46.399 --> 32:49.636
♪ Every time I'm with you, so
hard to be near you ♪

32:49.669 --> 32:52.039
♪ Heart beats- ♪

32:53.473 --> 32:55.542
-: Why'd you stop singing?

32:55.575 --> 32:58.645
-: I don't sing without the
music.

32:58.678 --> 33:01.949
-: Well let's see what happens
if you do.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.419
-: It's easier if you pick a
partner.

33:06.453 --> 33:09.589
(gentle glockenspiel melody)

33:20.500 --> 33:24.504

33:47.694 --> 33:48.695

33:56.503 --> 33:57.771
You're so tight.

33:58.438 --> 34:02.375
Excuse me, this is an active art
zone.

34:02.409 --> 34:03.410
-: Oh, sorry.

34:04.212 --> 34:06.780
I heard there was an audition
here?

34:06.814 --> 34:07.747
Sandy.

34:07.781 --> 34:08.681
It's me.

34:08.715 --> 34:09.817
Mackenzie.

34:09.851 --> 34:12.954
I was a freshman when you were a
senior at Fargo High.

34:12.987 --> 34:14.121
When you were Fantine in Les Mis

34:14.155 --> 34:16.456
I was starving prisoner number
two.

34:16.489 --> 34:20.027
We actually swapped mics after I
died in the first scene.

34:20.061 --> 34:20.928
-: Yes!

34:21.996 --> 34:22.864
Kenzie!

34:23.864 --> 34:26.033
(Sandrene and Mackenzie laugh)

34:26.067 --> 34:26.967
-: Oh yeah.

34:27.001 --> 34:29.170
I'd always have to go off
looking for you.

34:29.203 --> 34:32.572
You were usually huddled away in
some corner with Hank.

34:32.606 --> 34:33.908
You guys were so cute.

34:33.940 --> 34:35.675
-: Well thanks for coming in
today.

34:35.708 --> 34:38.112
-: Don't just skulk there like a
street urchin.

34:38.145 --> 34:40.114
State your credentials.

34:40.147 --> 34:41.181
-: Oh.

34:41.215 --> 34:42.482
(clears throat)

34:42.514 --> 34:43.885
Mackenzie Billingham.

34:43.918 --> 34:46.418
CCM class of 2021.

34:46.453 --> 34:49.656
BFA musical theater with a
concentration on acting.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.559
(Tucker snickers)

34:53.828 --> 34:55.728
-: Musical theater "acting?"

34:55.762 --> 34:57.530
(Tucker laughs)

34:57.564 --> 35:00.634
More like musical theater
schmacting.

35:05.039 --> 35:08.075
-: I've actually been
specializing in sense memory.

35:08.109 --> 35:10.777
So I've been reading up on Lee.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.747
-: Who's Lee?

35:13.780 --> 35:14.982
-: Strasberg!
-: Strasberg!

35:15.016 --> 35:18.886
-: Lee Strasberg, the founder of
the method.

35:18.920 --> 35:19.820
-: The method?

35:19.854 --> 35:21.488
-: Isn't that what killed that
Joker guy?

35:21.521 --> 35:22.489
-: Yes.

35:22.522 --> 35:24.758
That's how you knew he was doing
it correctly.

35:24.791 --> 35:25.659
-: Okay.

35:26.961 --> 35:29.997
(tense music)

35:30.031 --> 35:34.068
-: Let's see how sensitive your
memory really is.

35:34.101 --> 35:37.771
(whimsical music)

35:37.805 --> 35:38.672
-: Okay.

35:40.707 --> 35:42.642
I'm in a hallway and...

35:44.879 --> 35:47.081
I can smell my grandma's chicken
soup.

35:47.114 --> 35:48.581
(soup boiling)

35:48.615 --> 35:49.482
-: Mmm.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.489
-: I can hear the gentle summer
rain hitting the skylight.

35:56.523 --> 35:57.892
(rain falling)

35:57.925 --> 36:01.228
I'm walking past the dark wooden
door.

36:01.262 --> 36:04.098
With the brass handle carved by
my grandpa Sven.

36:04.131 --> 36:05.732
Brady: I'm not sure you carve
brass.

36:05.765 --> 36:06.599
-: Go on.

36:06.633 --> 36:07.935
Open it.

36:07.969 --> 36:08.836
-: No.

36:09.703 --> 36:11.238
No, I can't.

36:11.272 --> 36:13.808
It's always locked, that's my
dad's office.

36:13.841 --> 36:15.508
(ghostly echos)

36:15.542 --> 36:18.980
-: You know where the key is
hidden don't you?

36:19.013 --> 36:22.515
-: It's in the fern next to the
door.

36:22.549 --> 36:23.884
-: Grab it.

36:23.918 --> 36:24.784
Open it.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.754
-: I don't want to.

36:27.787 --> 36:29.056
-: Open it!
-: Open it!

36:29.090 --> 36:31.558
(Mackenzie screams)

36:31.591 --> 36:33.094
-: It's my dad!

36:33.127 --> 36:36.130
Fucking our tennis coach Jim!

36:36.163 --> 36:37.731
I hate you!

36:37.764 --> 36:40.533
I hate you dad, screw you!

36:40.567 --> 36:42.103
-: Yes!
-: Well done, dear.

36:42.136 --> 36:43.636
-: It's always those locked
doors.

36:43.670 --> 36:45.239
-: You guys are sick.

36:45.272 --> 36:46.673
Yorick: I wanna go next.

36:46.706 --> 36:48.242
-: That was amazing.

36:48.275 --> 36:50.077
-: Brilliant.

36:50.111 --> 36:52.645
So what do we call ourselves?

36:54.915 --> 36:58.052
(playful sneak music)

37:00.787 --> 37:01.956
-: Pst!

37:01.989 --> 37:03.858
The Tankhouse Theater.

37:05.692 --> 37:08.728
Their leader, Tucker, says he
wants to start

37:08.762 --> 37:10.797
some sort of a theatrical
revolution.

37:10.831 --> 37:11.866
-: Oh please.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.868
He's all hat and no cattle.

37:13.901 --> 37:15.735
Fargoans are gonna see through
him

37:15.769 --> 37:17.872
like long johns in a
thunderstorm.

37:17.905 --> 37:18.839
-: No.

37:18.873 --> 37:19.907
No, they're good.

37:19.940 --> 37:22.276
They got me emotional.

37:22.309 --> 37:24.979
I'm never actually emotional
onstage.

37:25.012 --> 37:26.814
-: You can be emotional
sometimes.

37:26.847 --> 37:27.647
-: Okay, thank you.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.516
-: I mean I don't always believe
you,

37:28.548 --> 37:30.583
but yeah yeah yeah, you're
emotional.

37:30.617 --> 37:31.819
-: Aww, that's really nice of
you.

37:31.852 --> 37:32.752
-: Just get to the point.

37:32.786 --> 37:33.454
-: Okay okay.

37:33.487 --> 37:34.288
So they're gonna do something

37:34.321 --> 37:35.890
called an immersive theater
attack

37:35.923 --> 37:37.324
at the farmer's market on
Sunday.

37:37.358 --> 37:39.793
Apparently it's gonna shake this
town to its core.

37:39.827 --> 37:41.228
-: I'm not gonna let some
foppish dandy

37:41.262 --> 37:43.630
take this theater away from me.

37:43.663 --> 37:44.932
Here's what I want you to do.

37:44.965 --> 37:46.233
I want you to infiltrate the
group,

37:46.267 --> 37:47.902
make yourself indispensable, and
then once

37:47.935 --> 37:49.669
you've earned their trust, just
yank

37:49.702 --> 37:51.771
the carpet right out from under
them.

37:51.806 --> 37:55.109
-: Mr. Mortenson, call me a
calculator.

37:55.142 --> 37:57.644
'Cause you can count on me.

37:57.677 --> 37:59.013
-: Did you just say that out
loud?

37:59.046 --> 37:59.880
-: I'm so sorry.

37:59.914 --> 38:00.580
-: Just get outta here.

38:00.613 --> 38:01.748
-: Okay, yeah, no, I'm sorry.

38:01.781 --> 38:02.615
-: Hey Sandy!

38:02.649 --> 38:04.018
Here, let me help you.

38:04.051 --> 38:05.853
-: No, I really gotta get these
back to the theater.

38:05.886 --> 38:07.154
We're only taking a five for
dinner.

38:07.188 --> 38:08.022
Thank you.

38:08.055 --> 38:08.721
-: I feel real bad about what
happened

38:08.755 --> 38:10.157
at the bar the other night.

38:10.191 --> 38:11.292
-: No, don't even worry about
it.

38:11.325 --> 38:14.028
-: No, seriously, not cool on my
part.

38:14.061 --> 38:16.163
You guys seem like you make a
good match.

38:16.197 --> 38:17.164
-: Well thank you.

38:17.198 --> 38:19.200
I appreciate that.

38:19.233 --> 38:21.734
-: I was just really pumped to
see you.

38:21.768 --> 38:23.670
You know, my mom had a little
party

38:23.703 --> 38:25.738
to watch your Rookie Badge
episode.

38:25.772 --> 38:26.706
-: What?

38:26.739 --> 38:28.375
I had like two lines in that.

38:28.409 --> 38:29.243
That's so sweet.

38:29.276 --> 38:31.278
-: No, seriously, when you told
that cop

38:31.312 --> 38:32.880
the suspect threw the girl's
remains

38:32.913 --> 38:35.216
into the dumpster, I totally
bought it.

38:35.249 --> 38:36.984
(Sandrene laughs)

38:37.017 --> 38:41.355
So can you still audition for
stuff out here?

38:41.388 --> 38:43.257
How does that work?

38:43.290 --> 38:44.258
-: Yeah, I mean kinda.

38:44.291 --> 38:46.793
I can self-tape for stuff.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.896
Actually, I just ran into this
agent guy in New York.

38:48.929 --> 38:51.132
He said he'd started sending me
out more.

38:51.165 --> 38:53.134
But who knows about that, you
know?

38:53.167 --> 38:54.034
-: Whoa.

38:54.969 --> 38:56.170
That's awesome.

38:57.438 --> 38:58.671
-: Yeah.

38:58.705 --> 39:02.009
Yeah, I guess it is kinda cool.

39:03.878 --> 39:05.279
Well, thank you.

39:05.312 --> 39:06.280
This is my stop.

39:06.313 --> 39:11.318
-: Hey, if you ever need help
with all that,

39:11.352 --> 39:12.920
Let me know.

39:12.953 --> 39:14.221
-: Thank you.

39:14.255 --> 39:17.258
-: As long as you thank me in
your Oscar speech.

39:17.291 --> 39:20.060
-: If I had a nickel for every
time someone asked me that.

39:20.094 --> 39:22.029
(Sandrene and Hank laugh)

39:22.062 --> 39:23.197
Okay, I'll see you.

39:23.230 --> 39:24.131
-: Yup, okay.

39:24.165 --> 39:24.999
Break a leg!

39:25.032 --> 39:25.665
Sandrene: Thanks!

39:25.698 --> 39:28.402
-: Five, six, seven, eight.

39:28.435 --> 39:29.336
Yup.

39:29.370 --> 39:31.438
Okay, that's not it at all.

39:31.472 --> 39:32.273
That's okay.

39:32.306 --> 39:34.308
Just lift up your hands like
this.

39:34.341 --> 39:35.342
-: Mackenzie.

39:37.978 --> 39:41.415
So after some reflection, I
think that we should

39:41.448 --> 39:43.250
make the truth you spoke about
your father

39:43.284 --> 39:45.752
the centerpiece of our
performance on the morrow, hmm?

39:45.785 --> 39:46.820
-: Oh.

39:46.854 --> 39:48.489
Oh I love that idea.

39:48.522 --> 39:50.124
I'm so ready to share that with
the world.

39:50.157 --> 39:52.792
-: Yeah, me too, but it is a
great responsibility.

39:52.826 --> 39:55.728
Do you think you can execute?

39:55.762 --> 39:57.398
-: You can count on me.

39:58.832 --> 40:00.367
-: Like a calculator.

40:01.402 --> 40:02.836
Oh.

40:02.870 --> 40:05.206
Uh-uh-uh, director eats first!

40:05.239 --> 40:07.007
Nina: And antibacterial hand
wipes.

40:07.041 --> 40:08.309
Please take one.

40:11.812 --> 40:12.745
-: Titania.

40:12.779 --> 40:15.082
Come in Titania, are the players
in position?

40:15.115 --> 40:18.819
-: Oberon, everyone is in
position except Mackenzie.

40:18.852 --> 40:19.987
She hasn't checked in yet

40:20.020 --> 40:22.056
and I don't see her anywhere.

40:22.089 --> 40:23.257
-: We should do it now.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.993
Lydia's here, she's the head
judge of the competition.

40:26.026 --> 40:27.261
Where is Mackenzie?

40:27.294 --> 40:27.928
-: I don't know.

40:27.962 --> 40:28.862
Don't worry about McKenzie.

40:28.896 --> 40:29.796
She's the most professional of
the bunch.

40:29.830 --> 40:33.334
Sandrene: Well everyone else is
in place.

40:33.367 --> 40:35.836
-: Good work, Titania.

40:35.869 --> 40:36.804
Oberon out.

40:44.211 --> 40:45.946
Ladies and gentlemen!

40:45.980 --> 40:48.549
My name is Tucker Charlemagne.

40:48.582 --> 40:51.318
And I'm afraid I have some
terrible news.

40:51.352 --> 40:52.853
There's been a murder!

40:52.886 --> 40:54.255
(crowd gasps)

40:54.288 --> 40:55.788
Over there!

40:55.823 --> 40:56.857
Come with me.

40:57.958 --> 40:58.826
Follow!

40:58.859 --> 40:59.860
Quickly!

40:59.893 --> 41:02.896
Townsfolk, stay on my heels!

41:02.930 --> 41:04.965
Just around this vehicle.

41:07.201 --> 41:08.068
No!

41:09.903 --> 41:11.572
Oh my goodness!

41:11.605 --> 41:13.073
What a disaster!

41:14.308 --> 41:17.144
But look, she's still alive.

41:17.177 --> 41:19.380
Beloved, who did this to you?

41:19.413 --> 41:20.547
-: It was...

41:20.581 --> 41:21.548
It was him!

41:21.582 --> 41:23.017
(dramatic piano sting)

41:23.050 --> 41:24.485
(Yorick evil laughs)

41:24.518 --> 41:26.020
(crowd gasps)

41:26.053 --> 41:27.787
-: He's getting away!

41:28.589 --> 41:30.591
-: I can find him!

41:30.624 --> 41:32.326
-: Quick, lead us.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.494
-: But I am weak.

41:33.527 --> 41:34.395
Catch me.

41:35.863 --> 41:36.864
-: You there.

41:37.598 --> 41:38.899
-: What can I do?

41:38.932 --> 41:40.601
I'm just a kid.

41:40.634 --> 41:44.571
-: Play that piano like her life
depends on it.

41:44.605 --> 41:45.606
-: Okay.

41:45.639 --> 41:49.376
(upbeat synthesizer music)

41:49.410 --> 41:52.513
What an authentic expression of
care.

41:52.546 --> 41:57.885
-: I'm no expert, but
authenticity seems to strengthen
him.

41:57.918 --> 41:59.386
-: That way!

41:59.420 --> 42:00.354
-: Oh my god.

42:00.387 --> 42:02.589
-: Well if you don't want me to
be anorexic.

42:02.623 --> 42:03.457
-: Shh fourth wall-

42:03.490 --> 42:04.391
Hey come on, let's go!

42:04.425 --> 42:05.059
-: That way!

42:05.092 --> 42:07.561
Come on everybody, let's go!

42:10.664 --> 42:12.966
This way, let's go, let's go.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.401
Inside, thank you, inside.

42:14.435 --> 42:15.436
-: There's the beast!

42:15.469 --> 42:17.371
(Yorick evil laughs)

42:17.404 --> 42:18.205
(crowd gasps)

42:18.238 --> 42:21.542
-: I have killed your precious
art!

42:21.575 --> 42:24.545
My power is greater than ever
and there's

42:24.578 --> 42:27.181
nothing you can do as stop me!

42:29.083 --> 42:29.950
-: Oh god!

42:31.285 --> 42:32.553
There's no hope.

42:35.456 --> 42:37.491
How can we ever save art?

42:39.326 --> 42:40.594
-: Bringing him down will take

42:40.627 --> 42:43.931
a truth bomb of epic
proportions!

42:43.964 --> 42:45.332
-: Yes.

42:45.366 --> 42:46.333
Yes.

42:46.367 --> 42:47.301
Yes!

42:47.334 --> 42:50.137
Quickly, does anyone have a
truth that needs

42:50.170 --> 42:53.073
to be spoken that hasn't been
given voice before?

42:53.107 --> 42:55.008
Do you have a...

42:55.042 --> 42:55.676
What about you?

42:55.709 --> 42:58.545
Come on, a secret, a truth?

42:58.579 --> 43:00.147
Come on, please, anyone, anyone.

43:00.180 --> 43:01.081
Do you have a truth?

43:01.115 --> 43:01.982
Please, anybody.

43:02.015 --> 43:03.617
Anybody, a truth?

43:03.650 --> 43:04.918
What about...

43:06.954 --> 43:07.621
You!

43:10.391 --> 43:13.260
(crowd murmuring)

43:16.430 --> 43:19.633
I say, a truth that hasn't been
spoken!

43:28.075 --> 43:30.144
Nothing about a dad?

43:30.177 --> 43:31.245
Tennis coach?

43:34.114 --> 43:35.182
A door? okay.

43:38.085 --> 43:39.520
-: Okay.

43:39.553 --> 43:41.622
-: All right, very well.

43:41.655 --> 43:43.590
I shall do this myself.

43:45.526 --> 43:47.961
From the dawn of time- not right
now.

43:47.995 --> 43:50.164
From the dawn of time,

43:50.197 --> 43:52.266
-: No, but if it's all the same
to you,

43:52.299 --> 43:55.235
there is a pretty big truth that
I,

43:55.904 --> 43:57.604
we, would like to get off our
chest.

43:57.638 --> 43:58.672
-: Dude, not now.

43:58.705 --> 43:59.573
Seriously.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.176
-: It is going to be okay.

44:02.209 --> 44:03.043
-: Brady!

44:03.076 --> 44:03.912
-: I promise.

44:03.944 --> 44:05.746
-: Hey, what's going on here,
kiddo?

44:05.779 --> 44:07.481
-: Dear town!

44:07.514 --> 44:08.449
Jack and I.

44:11.618 --> 44:12.719
We're together.

44:12.753 --> 44:14.521
(crowd murmuring)

44:14.555 --> 44:17.157
(tense music)

44:29.703 --> 44:31.271
-: You guys.

44:31.305 --> 44:34.107
(crowd applauds)

44:38.412 --> 44:40.781
(Sandrene giggles)

44:40.815 --> 44:42.449
-: Called that.

44:42.483 --> 44:43.784
-: Die.

44:43.818 --> 44:47.688
(Yorick death cries)

44:47.721 --> 44:50.290
(Sandrene gasps)

44:50.324 --> 44:52.159
-: It's gonna be okay.

44:52.192 --> 44:53.060
-: Oh yes.

44:56.230 --> 44:58.732
All: Art is truth brought to
life,

44:58.765 --> 45:01.735
and the truth shall set you
free!

45:01.768 --> 45:04.571
(crowd applauds)

45:07.508 --> 45:09.443
-: Beloved, how amazing!

45:17.351 --> 45:19.219
-: What an unmitigated disaster.

45:19.253 --> 45:22.055
-: Darling, it turned out better
than what we had planned.

45:22.089 --> 45:23.657
Let's just go back to the ranch,

45:23.690 --> 45:26.593
have a bacchanal, and move
forward okay?

45:26.627 --> 45:27.594
Brady: Wait, I'm confused.

45:27.628 --> 45:28.830
That was amazing, right guys?

45:28.863 --> 45:30.664
-: Did you hear the applause?

45:30.697 --> 45:33.200
-: Yeah, the crowd loved it.

45:33.233 --> 45:34.002
-: No!

45:34.034 --> 45:35.569
If we don't have artists
committed

45:35.602 --> 45:37.504
to our work, then what do we
have?

45:37.538 --> 45:38.605
Mackenzie: Hey!

45:38.639 --> 45:41.241
(tense music)

45:46.246 --> 45:47.347
-: What happened to you?

45:47.381 --> 45:49.851
-: You really thought I'd join
your group of misfits?

45:49.884 --> 45:51.184
(Mackenzie laughs)

45:51.218 --> 45:53.353
-: That was cute back there!

45:53.387 --> 45:55.589
I wouldn't call it theater, per
se.

45:55.622 --> 45:57.825
More like a prank really.

45:57.859 --> 46:00.427
-: You two gathered to conspire
against us?

46:00.460 --> 46:02.296
-: Good luck to you, Kenzie.

46:02.329 --> 46:04.197
Have fun in a dance studio

46:04.231 --> 46:06.266
conforming for the rest of your
life.

46:06.300 --> 46:09.236
(Tucker and Sandrene laugh)

46:09.269 --> 46:13.740
-: The way I see it, you're like
the boy who cried wolf.

46:13.774 --> 46:16.410
Your little trick can only last
for so long.

46:16.443 --> 46:18.478
People will catch on.

46:18.512 --> 46:20.347
And when they do, you can kick

46:20.380 --> 46:23.784
and scream and prank all you
want.

46:23.818 --> 46:25.452
No one will listen.

46:25.485 --> 46:27.822
-: Mr. Mortenson, what happened
to you?

46:27.855 --> 46:29.623
You used to be such a
sweetheart.

46:29.656 --> 46:32.726
-: Sandy, you had such promise
in the day, come join us.

46:32.759 --> 46:34.127
You don't belong with these
people.

46:34.161 --> 46:35.195
-: No way.

46:35.228 --> 46:36.797
-: There's no way she would
sully her lily white

46:36.831 --> 46:39.399
hands with your crowd-pleasing
drivel.

46:39.433 --> 46:40.667
(actors murmuring)

46:40.701 --> 46:43.270
Yorick: Drivel, I know that one.

46:43.303 --> 46:44.304
-: All right.

46:45.205 --> 46:47.909
Let's settle this right now.

46:47.942 --> 46:50.344
A Modern Major General-off.

46:50.377 --> 46:51.244
Just you and me.

46:51.278 --> 46:52.613
(tense music)

46:52.646 --> 46:53.881
Yorick: Should I get my sword?

46:53.915 --> 46:55.482
Uther: I smell trouble brewing.

46:55.515 --> 46:56.650
-: A Modern Major General-off?

46:56.683 --> 46:58.285
I've never seen one in real
life.

46:58.318 --> 46:59.386
-: What's a Modern Major
General-off?

46:59.419 --> 47:01.154
-: "I Am the Very Model of a
Modern Major-General"

47:01.188 --> 47:03.490
is the fastest song in the
English language canon.

47:03.523 --> 47:05.425
-: Major General-offs have been
illegal since two

47:05.459 --> 47:09.696
RSC members tried it in 1984 and
broke their jaws.

47:09.730 --> 47:12.165
-: Betrothéd, let me do this.

47:12.199 --> 47:14.735
-: No darling, this is extremely
perilous.

47:14.768 --> 47:15.602
-: I know.

47:15.636 --> 47:16.904
He taught me the part in high
school.

47:16.938 --> 47:18.672
I can beat him.

47:18.705 --> 47:20.374
-: Come on!

47:20.407 --> 47:22.776
We gonna do this or what?

47:22.810 --> 47:23.644
-: I love you.

47:23.677 --> 47:24.544
-: Wait.

47:26.613 --> 47:27.481

You have to realize that if you

cock-up

49:55.595 --> 49:57.098

50:02.103 --> 50:04.071
God, you're so controlling
sometimes.

call it directing.

Mackenzie.

go according to plan,

50:11.846 --> 50:14.916

Stop being such a mule.

production of The Sound of
Music.

betrayal, capiche?

50:32.766 --> 50:33.835
Oh geez!

50:33.868 --> 50:35.036
What?

50:35.069 --> 50:35.903
-: Sorry.

50:35.937 --> 50:36.770
-: It's locked.

50:36.804 --> 50:38.840
Yorick: We can't get in.

50:38.873 --> 50:40.640
-: You have a key to the barn?

50:40.674 --> 50:42.877
-: Yes, I have the keys.

50:42.910 --> 50:44.011
Come on in, you guys.

50:44.045 --> 50:44.946
Uther: I smell hay!

50:44.979 --> 50:47.882
Sandrene: Mi casa es su casa.

50:47.915 --> 50:49.382
Nina: I have water.

50:49.416 --> 50:52.053
I've never been around underage
drinking before.

50:52.086 --> 50:54.588
-: All right everyone, I wanna
make an announcement.

50:54.621 --> 50:55.957
Thank you.

50:55.990 --> 50:56.858
Beloved.

50:57.825 --> 51:02.696
I just want to raise a goblet to
these two beautiful boys.

51:02.729 --> 51:06.566
Planning that surprise was the
perfect example of risk.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.169
-: Well we didn't plan it.

51:08.202 --> 51:09.904
-: Congratulations to all!

51:09.937 --> 51:10.972
Drink up!

51:11.005 --> 51:12.439
Yorick: Skol!

51:12.472 --> 51:14.075
-: I love fruit punch!

51:16.077 --> 51:19.981
-: Look bonbon, I think we
should agree to disagree.

51:20.014 --> 51:22.083
I don't wanna fight with you.

51:22.116 --> 51:23.050
I love you.

51:23.885 --> 51:26.954
Let's just have fun tonight,
okay?

51:28.755 --> 51:30.858
(Tucker and Sandrene chuckle)

51:30.892 --> 51:31.758
-: Drink up.

51:31.791 --> 51:32.659
-: Okay.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.897
(rock music)

51:42.702 --> 51:44.471
Buford: If you're ever going

51:44.504 --> 51:47.808
to discover the true purpose of
theater,

51:47.842 --> 51:50.443
you must have this experience.

51:51.778 --> 51:54.081
(Leah and Nina cheer)

51:54.115 --> 51:55.082
(Yorick screams)

51:55.116 --> 51:56.750
-: It is absolutely not a thing.

51:56.783 --> 51:59.586
-: What do you, explain your
point with words please.

51:59.619 --> 52:01.088
-: When you're dancing with the
lighting,

52:01.122 --> 52:02.857
and dancers, and your lighting
with dancers,

52:02.890 --> 52:05.993
you wanna see their angles and
the bodies and the shapes.

52:06.027 --> 52:06.994
-: Look, poppet.

52:07.028 --> 52:07.962
-: Huh?

52:07.995 --> 52:10.730
-: The group is really starting
to "cohese."

52:10.764 --> 52:13.834
-: Yes, it's like they're
melting together

52:13.868 --> 52:18.505
like a Croque Monsieur.

52:18.538 --> 52:19.206
-: You mad?

52:21.775 --> 52:25.046
-: Did you consider maybe I
didn't wanna

52:25.079 --> 52:28.916
come out to the whole farmer's
market?

52:28.950 --> 52:31.785
-: But what are you so worried
about, man?

52:31.819 --> 52:33.586
I mean your mom?

52:33.620 --> 52:35.622
Dude, she was totally happy.

52:35.655 --> 52:38.259
-: That's 'cause everyone was
watching.

52:38.292 --> 52:41.996
This town is mad conservative,
dude.

52:42.029 --> 52:43.563
You have no idea.

52:48.568 --> 52:49.703
-: I do though.

52:58.545 --> 52:59.447
-: Don't do that.

52:59.479 --> 53:02.749
-: Boys, what is doing on over
here huh?

53:02.782 --> 53:07.620
-: Nothing like a little
showmance to spice up the gumbo.

53:07.654 --> 53:09.622
-: Did we ever tell you about
the first time

53:09.656 --> 53:11.524
that Sandrene and I made love?

53:11.558 --> 53:12.893
-: Why do you guys smell like
garlic?

53:12.927 --> 53:15.595
-: It was a cast party just like
this one.

53:15.628 --> 53:16.897
-: Just let me out first.

53:16.931 --> 53:18.798
Just let me out first!

53:20.167 --> 53:22.103
(unintelligible)

53:22.136 --> 53:24.305
(cans clanging)

53:24.338 --> 53:25.272
-: Yeah, hi.

53:25.973 --> 53:28.175
Can I get 10 extra large with

53:28.209 --> 53:30.011
zucchini flowers if you have it?

53:30.044 --> 53:33.214
("call waiting" beeps)

53:36.583 --> 53:37.918
-: Oh.

53:37.952 --> 53:39.053
Mr. Marlow.

53:39.086 --> 53:41.788
Is that a scimitar or are you
just happy to see me?

53:41.822 --> 53:44.691
(Tucker chuckles)

53:46.093 --> 53:47.161
-: Brian, hey.

53:50.364 --> 53:51.899
A self-tape?

53:51.932 --> 53:52.799
Really?

53:53.901 --> 53:54.869
Yeah.

53:54.902 --> 53:56.237
No, I'm in Fargo.

53:57.304 --> 54:00.141
Yeah, it comes out sometimes.

54:00.174 --> 54:01.809
Yeah, okay.

54:01.842 --> 54:04.111
I'll get it in immediately.

54:04.145 --> 54:05.913
Okay perfect.

54:05.946 --> 54:06.881
Great, bye.

54:11.718 --> 54:14.321
(dramatic music)

54:19.093 --> 54:22.129
(rooster crows)

54:22.163 --> 54:23.197
Rise and shine!

54:23.230 --> 54:24.932
(pots and pans clanging)

54:24.965 --> 54:28.069
(actors groaning)

54:28.102 --> 54:30.237
-: Ideokinesis on the porch!

54:30.271 --> 54:31.338
Everybody up!

54:31.372 --> 54:34.208
-: Ideokinesis is an intimate
technique that opens

54:34.241 --> 54:37.644
the energy centers around the
pelvic floor.

54:37.677 --> 54:39.046
-: Ooh yeah, that's good.

54:39.080 --> 54:42.749
Tucker: Trust the process,
children.

54:42.782 --> 54:44.151
Yorick: Oh Brady, look what you
did.

54:44.185 --> 54:45.219
(Yorick chuckles)

54:45.252 --> 54:46.153
-: Oh my god, no!

54:46.187 --> 54:47.154
I'm done with this!

54:47.188 --> 54:49.056
-: All right, calm down
everybody, calm down.

54:49.090 --> 54:50.357
I know it's wet, I know it's
cold, all right?

54:50.391 --> 54:51.658
But we're gonna do a couple more

54:51.691 --> 54:53.828
sacrum scrubs and then it's back
to town.

54:53.861 --> 54:55.963
(trumpet blaring)

54:55.996 --> 54:57.031
Sandrene: Darling, look.

54:57.064 --> 54:57.865
The Squire.

54:57.898 --> 55:00.733
-: All the way from New York
City?

55:03.270 --> 55:04.939
Ah.

55:04.972 --> 55:06.173
Good Squire.

55:06.207 --> 55:07.808
What news bring you?

55:07.842 --> 55:09.310
-: Hear ye, hear ye!

55:10.311 --> 55:13.214
I come bearing tragic news!

55:13.247 --> 55:16.851
It is with great sorrow that I
inform you that

55:16.884 --> 55:20.955
Buford Schlesinger, the honored
artistic director

55:20.988 --> 55:24.959
of the Artist's Atelier, after
his decades-long

55:24.992 --> 55:29.296
battle with gout, has passed
away!

55:29.330 --> 55:32.066
(actors murmur)

55:32.099 --> 55:33.901
-: No no no no no!

55:33.934 --> 55:36.871
(Tucker crying)

55:36.904 --> 55:37.770
No!

55:39.306 --> 55:40.174
Buford!

55:44.178 --> 55:45.045
No!

55:46.713 --> 55:47.381
Buford!

55:48.282 --> 55:49.984
Why?

55:50.017 --> 55:52.920
-: I don't know what this is
about right now.

55:52.953 --> 55:54.889
-: Rehearsals dismissed!

55:58.058 --> 56:00.693
-: I'm sorry, but we kinda got a
ride with you--

56:00.727 --> 56:01.896
-: Get another ride!

56:03.330 --> 56:05.332
-: Absolutely, totally
understand.

56:05.366 --> 56:06.867
We'll figure it out.

56:06.901 --> 56:08.903
(Squire crying)

56:08.936 --> 56:10.838
♪ Why take it ♪

56:10.871 --> 56:13.274
♪ It is thine ♪

56:14.808 --> 56:16.076
-: Again.

56:16.110 --> 56:17.378
-: I can't, Mr. Mortenson.

56:17.411 --> 56:18.946
I've done it a thousand times.

56:18.979 --> 56:20.080
-: Again please!

56:20.114 --> 56:24.218
-: I'm literally dying up here,
I can't do this anymore!

56:24.251 --> 56:25.085
-: You're dying?

56:25.119 --> 56:26.887
From singing a song?

56:26.921 --> 56:27.754
Get her outta here.

56:27.787 --> 56:30.991
Get her smelling salts for all I
care.

56:31.025 --> 56:31.926
Hey!

56:31.959 --> 56:33.726
Lisa, Ashley, what the hell are
you doing?

56:33.760 --> 56:36.964
I told you, no cell phones in
the rehearsal space.

56:36.997 --> 56:40.100
-: Why don't we ever get to
massage each other?

56:40.134 --> 56:42.203
-: What the hell are you talking
about?

56:42.236 --> 56:44.505
-: Brady is posting them all at
the Tankhouse cast party.

56:44.538 --> 56:46.773
It looks so fun.

56:46.807 --> 56:48.108
-: I'm so jealous.

56:48.142 --> 56:51.812
All of their warmups are
clothing optional.

56:52.880 --> 56:55.449
-: Theater is about hard work.

56:55.482 --> 56:56.984
Precision.

56:57.017 --> 56:57.885
Pain.

56:58.852 --> 57:01.055
It's not some bordello.

57:01.088 --> 57:02.056
-: Well maybe if you had more
fun

57:02.089 --> 57:03.991
you wouldn't have lost the
Major-General off.

57:04.024 --> 57:05.025
-: Excuse me?

57:05.725 --> 57:08.329
-: Just doing a tongue stretch.

57:12.799 --> 57:16.270
-: Well it won't be fun when I
show Captain Mikkelsen this.

57:16.303 --> 57:18.005
(Tucker crying)

57:18.038 --> 57:19.406
-: Oh Buford!

57:19.440 --> 57:21.909
Why would you leave me here?

57:25.179 --> 57:27.881
(mischievous music)

57:30.985 --> 57:34.555
-: Pretty cool getting to be a
part of the movie magic.

57:34.588 --> 57:38.125
Hope I can do uh... "Logan"
justice.

57:38.158 --> 57:40.060
-: Yeah, hold on, sorry.

57:40.094 --> 57:41.128
The lighting is perfect right
now,

57:41.161 --> 57:42.296
so if we could just get started

57:42.329 --> 57:44.131
'cause they're casting this off
the tape.

57:44.164 --> 57:46.934
And it's for the CW, so I need
to look CW-ish.

57:46.967 --> 57:47.968
-: Whoa!

57:48.002 --> 57:49.303
CW.

57:49.336 --> 57:53.407
Are you gonna be a sexy witch or
a sexy werewolf?

57:54.608 --> 57:55.809
I'm kidding.

57:56.543 --> 57:57.478
-: Okay, let's get going.

57:57.511 --> 57:59.146
Tucker's guru just died and I
need to hold

57:59.179 --> 58:02.549
the bucket for him while he
purges his grief.

58:02.583 --> 58:03.951
-: Wait.

58:03.984 --> 58:06.820
Does he know you're here?

58:06.854 --> 58:08.589
-: Tuck really hates network
television.

58:08.622 --> 58:11.091
He thinks it's "lulling the
masses into a stupor

58:11.125 --> 58:14.361
"while they get disenfranchised
by the ruling class."

58:16.397 --> 58:17.531
Or something.

58:17.564 --> 58:21.168
(Hank and Sandrene laugh)

58:22.970 --> 58:25.873
I know he's a lot, and I know
you don't

58:25.906 --> 58:28.409
understand him, but he's
passionate

58:28.442 --> 58:32.479
and ambitious and driven and
we...

58:32.513 --> 58:34.348
Need each other.

58:35.149 --> 58:38.852
-: But you can't be honest with
each other?

58:38.886 --> 58:43.957
You always told me that your big
dream was to be on TV.

58:43.991 --> 58:44.858
-: It was.

58:47.261 --> 58:48.128
It is.

58:50.331 --> 58:51.198
-: Well.

58:52.599 --> 58:55.269
Is Tucker a part of that dream?

58:57.905 --> 59:00.307
(tense music)

59:01.442 --> 59:04.178
-: Come here come here come
here.

59:06.180 --> 59:07.581
-: Thank you so much.

59:07.614 --> 59:09.083
You're the best.

59:12.252 --> 59:13.620
-: Okay.

59:13.654 --> 59:16.990
(playful sneak music)

59:18.659 --> 59:19.493
-: Pauline.

59:19.526 --> 59:20.494
-: Whoa!

59:20.527 --> 59:22.396
Morten, what are you doing
hiding down there

59:22.429 --> 59:26.033
like a pregnant possum in a
pumpkin patch?

59:27.634 --> 59:29.403
What has gotten into you?

59:29.436 --> 59:30.904
Seems like everyone around here
is losing

59:30.938 --> 59:34.208
their right minds over this
competition.

59:35.509 --> 59:38.011
-: Something I wanna show you.

59:38.045 --> 59:38.912
-: Huh?

59:45.619 --> 59:46.487
Oh.

59:48.422 --> 59:51.024
-: Did you sleep at all last
night, darling?

59:51.058 --> 59:51.892
-: I'm not sure.

59:51.925 --> 59:55.929
I took about eight Melatonin at
5 AM.

59:55.963 --> 59:57.431
I just can't stop thinking about

59:57.464 --> 01:00:00.234
the last thing that Buford ever
said to me.

01:00:00.267 --> 01:00:03.670
I was to find the true purpose
of theater.

01:00:05.005 --> 01:00:07.207
-: Well we've brought people
together

01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:10.010
and helped them find their
voices as artists.

01:00:10.043 --> 01:00:11.512
And our final performance can be
a place

01:00:11.545 --> 01:00:15.482
to showcase what makes our
ensemble so special.

01:00:17.084 --> 01:00:17.718
-: No.

01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:18.619
-: No?

01:00:18.652 --> 01:00:19.753
-: No.

01:00:19.787 --> 01:00:24.725
Buford sent me here to redefine
theater as we know it.

01:00:24.758 --> 01:00:25.759
-: Oh is that what he said?

01:00:25.793 --> 01:00:29.062
-: And these people will be the
raw materials

01:00:29.096 --> 01:00:31.064
with which I craft my
masterpiece!

01:00:31.098 --> 01:00:33.100
-: Tucker, you're getting
carried away.

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:34.501
-: Hey Tucker?

01:00:34.535 --> 01:00:36.370
Yorick and I have been
channeling our rage

01:00:36.403 --> 01:00:38.539
into this really cool stage
combat sequence

01:00:38.572 --> 01:00:40.374
that we think would be great for
the finale.

01:00:40.407 --> 01:00:42.376
-: Ooh, and I can't wait to try
out my crowd work.

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:43.510
-: Thank you all for your
suggestions,

01:00:43.544 --> 01:00:45.179
but they will not be necessary.

01:00:45.212 --> 01:00:46.280
-: Tucker.

01:00:46.313 --> 01:00:48.182
-: I've been very clear with you
all from the outset.

01:00:48.215 --> 01:00:51.318
Our mission here is to create a
theatrical revolution

01:00:51.351 --> 01:00:52.753
so that I may take my rightful
place

01:00:52.786 --> 01:00:55.155
at the apex of the avant-garde.

01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:58.459
Now Buford's death, I'm sorry,
confirms.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.395
That my time is now.

01:01:02.429 --> 01:01:06.667
-: So, like, we've all never
been totally sure who Buford is?

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.501
-: Yeah.
-: Yeah.

01:01:07.534 --> 01:01:09.036
-: That's very funny.

01:01:11.772 --> 01:01:14.274
Ladies and gentlemen, there
comes a point

01:01:14.308 --> 01:01:17.010
in every artist's journey where
he, or she,

01:01:17.044 --> 01:01:19.580
must take a step back from
creating their own work

01:01:19.613 --> 01:01:22.516
and take part in the equally
fulfilling task

01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:25.285
of executing other people's
instructions!

01:01:25.319 --> 01:01:26.153
-: Ha.

01:01:27.654 --> 01:01:29.590
-: I'm sorry, Nina.

01:01:29.623 --> 01:01:30.657
Something humorous?

01:01:30.691 --> 01:01:32.793
-: That's exactly what Morton
said when I demoed

01:01:32.827 --> 01:01:35.195
my take for the lighting design
of Pirates.

01:01:35.229 --> 01:01:37.064
-: Yes dear, weren't you the one

01:01:37.097 --> 01:01:39.533
that teased them about
conforming?

01:01:39.566 --> 01:01:40.667
-: No.

01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:42.769
No no, no no no no no no, that
is completely different.

01:01:42.803 --> 01:01:44.705
Look, this is not a debate.

01:01:44.738 --> 01:01:47.508
You will all execute my
instructions,

01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:51.278
we will win that theater, and
that is final!

01:01:58.452 --> 01:01:59.620
-: Whoa!
-: Hey!

01:01:59.653 --> 01:02:00.621
-: What happened?

01:02:00.654 --> 01:02:03.657
-: No one leaves this room until
I am satisfied!

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:05.259
-: My phone is charging in the
bar

01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:07.094
My mom is gonna wonder where I
am.

01:02:07.127 --> 01:02:08.462
-: This is a fire hazard.

01:02:08.495 --> 01:02:09.396
What are we going to eat?

01:02:09.429 --> 01:02:11.265
There's no food in here.

01:02:11.298 --> 01:02:13.835
-: There's plenty of Aquavit.

01:02:13.868 --> 01:02:14.701
-: Eww.

01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:15.602
-: Ugh.

01:02:16.703 --> 01:02:19.706
(pop montage music)

01:02:28.115 --> 01:02:30.717
(horse neighing)

01:02:38.258 --> 01:02:39.159
-: Faster!

01:02:39.192 --> 01:02:40.294
Faster faster faster!

01:02:40.327 --> 01:02:41.361
Slower slower slower!

01:02:41.395 --> 01:02:42.796
One hand fast, the other slow!

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:44.731
That one's fast, that one's
slow!

01:02:44.765 --> 01:02:46.099
Go go go!

01:02:46.133 --> 01:02:47.801
'Drene are you getting this?

01:02:47.835 --> 01:02:48.669
-: Yes.

01:02:48.702 --> 01:02:50.771
-: Okay, fast, slow, fast!

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.382
(Leah barfs)

01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:05.252
(actors groan)

01:03:05.285 --> 01:03:07.754
(upbeat music)

01:03:10.825 --> 01:03:13.493
(actors groan)

01:03:16.898 --> 01:03:19.399
Jack: The sun burns.

01:03:19.433 --> 01:03:20.868
-: Oh my god, it's 9:55.

01:03:20.902 --> 01:03:21.936
We have five minutes to get
there.

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:24.371
-: Tucker, you weren't keeping
track of the time?

01:03:24.404 --> 01:03:25.305
-: I didn't hear the lark.

01:03:25.339 --> 01:03:27.207
Did you hear the lark?

01:03:28.408 --> 01:03:29.811
Yorick: I'm gonna use the
slingshot.

01:03:29.844 --> 01:03:31.012
Nina: No no no, I think we
decided on

01:03:31.045 --> 01:03:33.313
the North Korean style movement
piece with the streamers.

01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:34.715
Uther: I hear footsteps.

01:03:34.748 --> 01:03:36.683
Brady: Did we decide live horse
or a dead horse?

01:03:36.717 --> 01:03:37.551
Uther: Hello?

01:03:37.584 --> 01:03:39.553
Where is everyone?

01:03:39.586 --> 01:03:41.388
Leah: Does somebody have any
mouthwash?

01:03:41.421 --> 01:03:43.156
(phone rings)

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:45.392
-: Hello, is this Jax Winn?

01:03:47.628 --> 01:03:49.596
Yeah, hello, this is Captain
Pauline Mikkelsen

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:52.733
of the Fargo PD, I just had a
question for you

01:03:52.766 --> 01:03:56.203
about an immersive theater
performance.

01:03:56.236 --> 01:03:59.239
(tense piano music)

01:04:03.543 --> 01:04:04.378
-: Lydia.

01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:06.480
-: Oh hi, nice to see you.

01:04:10.317 --> 01:04:11.184
-: Whoa!

01:04:12.452 --> 01:04:13.387
What are you whispering about?

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.254
Do you need tampons?

01:04:14.287 --> 01:04:15.756
'Cause I have those.

01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:16.623
Nina: No, I--

01:04:16.657 --> 01:04:17.491
-: Do you need Extra Plus?

01:04:17.524 --> 01:04:18.358
I have that too.

01:04:18.392 --> 01:04:19.493
-: No no, I only use pads.

01:04:19.526 --> 01:04:22.396
-: Tucker, you changed your mind
30,000 times last night.

01:04:22.429 --> 01:04:24.631
Now nobody has any idea what's
going on and everyone

01:04:24.665 --> 01:04:27.701
thinks your masterpiece is gonna
be a disaster.

01:04:27.734 --> 01:04:29.937
Lydia: And now, ladies and
gents,

01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:33.507
please welcome to the stage the
Red River Players.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.543

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.562
for The Tankhouse Theater.

01:06:35.595 --> 01:06:37.397
-: Just remember to...

01:06:38.765 --> 01:06:42.069
Commit to the text and
everything will be fine.

01:06:42.103 --> 01:06:43.703
-: There's no text.

01:06:43.737 --> 01:06:44.906
-: Places!

01:06:44.939 --> 01:06:48.408
(dramatic violin music)

01:07:10.865 --> 01:07:14.334
-: From the dawn of time!
-: How dare you!

01:07:15.036 --> 01:07:17.872
-: I've been cuckolded before
mine own eyes.

01:07:17.905 --> 01:07:20.875
-: Ah yes, the eye of the play!

01:07:20.908 --> 01:07:22.576
-: 'Drene!

01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:24.879
How could you do this to me?

01:07:25.579 --> 01:07:27.882
-: Beloved, what in the devil?

01:07:27.915 --> 01:07:29.116
-: What is happening?

01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:30.952
-: This is part of their whole
"thing."

01:07:30.985 --> 01:07:32.887
-: Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.888
-: Know what?

01:07:33.921 --> 01:07:36.556
-: That you've been cheating on
me with Hank!

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:38.926
(audience gasps)

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.594
Salacious!

01:07:43.496 --> 01:07:44.664
-: Okay, I wasn't cheating on
you,

01:07:44.698 --> 01:07:45.967
but can we please talk about
this--

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.168
-: I trusted you!

01:07:47.201 --> 01:07:48.668
-: We weren't cheating.

01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:50.838
-: Now you're going to lie?

01:07:56.911 --> 01:07:59.981
-: He was helping me with a
self-tape.

01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:02.950
-: A.

01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:04.718
Self.

01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:06.888
Tape.

01:08:06.921 --> 01:08:09.857
(audience murmurs)

01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:15.029
I can never forgive you.

01:08:15.062 --> 01:08:17.631
-: What's a self-tape?

01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:20.935
-: Well I'm sorry, but it's for
a new CW show.

01:08:20.968 --> 01:08:22.469
It's between me and one other
girl

01:08:22.502 --> 01:08:25.639
and I find out any minute if I
got it.

01:08:31.711 --> 01:08:33.180
Jack: Sorry, what's happening?

01:08:33.214 --> 01:08:35.149
-: The CW, it's like, real TV.

01:08:35.182 --> 01:08:35.850
-: Wow!

01:08:35.883 --> 01:08:38.152
Are you gonna be a sexy witch?

01:08:38.185 --> 01:08:39.685
Or a sexy werewolf?

01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:40.620
Brady: Oh my god, Sandrene, you
have

01:08:40.654 --> 01:08:42.189
to come on my podcast when
you're famous.

01:08:42.223 --> 01:08:43.790
-: Yeah, I'm sure all 13 of your

01:08:43.823 --> 01:08:45.158
listeners would love that,
Brady.

01:08:45.192 --> 01:08:47.794
(audience oohs)

01:08:47.828 --> 01:08:49.029
-: Okay Jack.

01:08:49.063 --> 01:08:50.596
Can we stop this?

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:53.033
I love you, okay?

01:08:53.067 --> 01:08:54.001
I love you!

01:08:55.136 --> 01:08:56.736
(audience awws)

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:58.139
-: Oh, oh, oh!

01:08:58.171 --> 01:08:59.639
You have a missed call!

01:08:59.673 --> 01:09:03.144
Ooh-hoo, it's from 2-1-2.

01:09:03.176 --> 01:09:04.511
I'm dialing.

01:09:04.544 --> 01:09:05.645
(phone rings)

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:06.613
Here, here.

01:09:10.184 --> 01:09:11.185
-: Hey Brian.

01:09:13.988 --> 01:09:14.854
Yeah.

01:09:16.622 --> 01:09:17.490
What?

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:19.160
What?

01:09:20.194 --> 01:09:21.228
You're kidding!

01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:22.629
Oh my god!

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:23.529
Oh my god.

01:09:25.099 --> 01:09:26.167
I got the part!

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.970
(audience cheers and applauds)

01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:30.171
I got it!

01:09:30.203 --> 01:09:31.604
I got the part!

01:09:35.009 --> 01:09:35.876
-: Yeah!

01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:40.147
-: No no no no, stop stop stop
stop!

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:44.185
Sandrene, you're not gonna do it
right?

01:09:44.218 --> 01:09:45.785
-: What?

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:48.956
-: Think about our artistic
revolution.

01:09:49.823 --> 01:09:51.058
-: Tucker.

01:09:51.091 --> 01:09:54.661
Tucker, this is all I ever
wanted.

01:09:54.694 --> 01:09:57.530
It's the opportunity of a
lifetime.

01:09:57.564 --> 01:10:01.668
They're literally flying me out
tomorrow morning.

01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:03.670
-: I can't believe you're gonna
be on the CW.

01:10:03.703 --> 01:10:06.007
This is so amazing.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:06.907
-: No.

01:10:08.742 --> 01:10:10.077
It's not amazing.

01:10:11.012 --> 01:10:12.146
It's betrayal.

01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:15.916
Ensemble.

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:16.817
And.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.653
I guess, audience.

01:10:21.422 --> 01:10:24.691
I'm afraid I have an
announcement to make.

01:10:24.724 --> 01:10:28.728
Sandrene is no longer a member
of the Tankhouse.

01:10:30.865 --> 01:10:33.300
She was too busy selling out.

01:10:33.334 --> 01:10:36.837
(audience gasps)

01:10:36.871 --> 01:10:38.873
-: Truly typical, Tucker.

01:10:38.906 --> 01:10:40.707
You hide behind your art, but
you

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.877
wish you had these
opportunities.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:46.180
And it kills you to see others,
especially me, get them!

01:10:46.213 --> 01:10:49.183
'Cause you think you're better
than everyone else!

01:10:49.216 --> 01:10:51.118
And you're not.

01:10:51.152 --> 01:10:52.086
You're not.

01:10:55.823 --> 01:10:59.659
-: Heaven truly knows that thou
art false as hell.

01:10:59.692 --> 01:11:00.727
-: How am I false?

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.129
-: Leave her alone!

01:11:02.163 --> 01:11:04.165
Sandrene needs a real man.

01:11:04.198 --> 01:11:06.666
(audience applauds)

01:11:06.699 --> 01:11:09.036
-: Oh no no no, Hankery, take
her!

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:12.605
You can be happy little hayseeds
together.

01:11:12.639 --> 01:11:14.041
You, we, are done!

01:11:15.276 --> 01:11:16.444
-: Great!

01:11:16.477 --> 01:11:19.980
Then you can just swiftly move
out of my parents' ranch,

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:23.217
which you've been staying in by
the way, for free!

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.385
(audience oohs)

01:11:24.418 --> 01:11:25.386
-: "Free" is--

01:11:25.419 --> 01:11:26.586
-: Did you even send my mother a
thank you note?

01:11:26.619 --> 01:11:28.956
-: If I hear about these thank
you notes one more time--

01:11:28.989 --> 01:11:30.991
-: Everyone just shut up!

01:11:32.226 --> 01:11:34.061
We dedicated our time and effort

01:11:34.095 --> 01:11:36.197
to this company because we
believed in you two!

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:37.664
And now look at you!

01:11:37.697 --> 01:11:39.066
You're childish and you're
selfish

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.634
and you don't care about art!

01:11:43.104 --> 01:11:44.905
I am resetting for top of show

01:11:44.939 --> 01:11:46.773
and we are trying this again!

01:11:46.807 --> 01:11:47.674
Okay?

01:11:51.278 --> 01:11:52.847
-: Oh, that must be it.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.883
(audience applauds)

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:00.888
-: Look, they're clapping.

01:12:00.921 --> 01:12:02.923
-: Why are they clapping?

01:12:12.399 --> 01:12:13.367
-: Wow.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.902
How much fun was that?

01:12:14.935 --> 01:12:18.405
Let's give it up for The
Tankhouse Theater.

01:12:22.977 --> 01:12:23.844
-: Stop!

01:12:24.812 --> 01:12:25.813
Stop!

01:12:25.846 --> 01:12:26.914
-: Is this part of it too?

01:12:26.947 --> 01:12:27.780
-: I don't know.

01:12:27.815 --> 01:12:30.017
-: I have sworn testimony
confirming

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:33.187
Tucker Charlemagne and Sandrene
Rothstein's

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:36.957
prohibition from performing in
New York.

01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:38.259
Due to their negligence leading

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:40.261
to the death of an audience
member

01:12:40.294 --> 01:12:42.263
during one of their
performances.

01:12:42.296 --> 01:12:44.465
No one implicated in a felony

01:12:44.498 --> 01:12:48.202
can take possession of a city
landmark.

01:12:48.235 --> 01:12:50.737
They cannot win the theater.

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:51.805
-: Please.

01:12:51.839 --> 01:12:53.474
Shire Reeve, I implore you.

01:12:53.507 --> 01:12:56.709
-: In good conscience I can't
let you corrupt my son,

01:12:56.743 --> 01:12:59.712
or these people, for one more
minute.

01:12:59.746 --> 01:13:02.049
-: I'm the corrupter?

01:13:02.082 --> 01:13:05.152
I shared my gifts with you
yokels!

01:13:05.186 --> 01:13:08.289
Pearls suckled from the teat of
America's

01:13:08.322 --> 01:13:11.358
theatrical breast, New York
City!

01:13:11.392 --> 01:13:12.759
You heard of it?

01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:14.828
It's not my fault if these
bumpkins

01:13:14.862 --> 01:13:16.931
can't grasp the grandeur I'm
giving them!

01:13:16.964 --> 01:13:18.265
-: Tucker, control thyself!

01:13:18.299 --> 01:13:20.901
-: And thank you, Sandy
Rothstein,

01:13:20.935 --> 01:13:22.436
for teaching me that success
only comes

01:13:22.469 --> 01:13:25.439
when you toss aside those you
care about most

01:13:25.472 --> 01:13:29.742
in the pursuit of your own
selfish purposes.

01:13:29.776 --> 01:13:32.179
Well consider yourself tossed.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.819
Lydia: Well in light of this
news, I guess

01:13:38.852 --> 01:13:41.055
we have no other option but to
award

01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:44.391
the Fargo Theater to the Red
River Players.

01:13:44.425 --> 01:13:47.428
(audience applauds)

01:13:54.868 --> 01:13:55.735
-: Oofta.

01:13:56.403 --> 01:13:57.404
-: Oh my god.

01:13:58.872 --> 01:14:00.374
I cannot believe the Tankhouse
people

01:14:00.407 --> 01:14:02.309
are full on psycho murderers.

01:14:02.343 --> 01:14:05.813
I wonder who tipped off Captain
Pauline.

01:14:06.914 --> 01:14:07.780
Oh my god.

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:10.251
It was you.

01:14:10.284 --> 01:14:12.920
Mr. Mortenson, I love that.

01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:14.021
-: Shh.

01:14:14.054 --> 01:14:15.923
Just keep your voice down.

01:14:15.956 --> 01:14:18.392
This is nothing to be proud of.

01:14:20.961 --> 01:14:23.364
-: Well then why did you do it?

01:14:25.933 --> 01:14:27.835
-: You have your whole life
ahead of you.

01:14:27.868 --> 01:14:29.536
Endless possibilities.

01:14:32.006 --> 01:14:36.443
All I have is a past filled with
missed opportunities.

01:14:36.477 --> 01:14:38.412
And a present that I'm working

01:14:38.445 --> 01:14:40.914
very hard to make tolerable.

01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:45.552
-: I'm sorry, I didn't realize
that...

01:14:45.586 --> 01:14:46.453
-: What?

01:14:50.257 --> 01:14:53.093
That I'm not through dreaming?

01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:58.932
(dramatic music)

01:15:30.364 --> 01:15:31.231
-: Tucker!

01:15:33.967 --> 01:15:35.436
-: Uther, what are you doing
here?

01:15:35.469 --> 01:15:38.172
-: What are you doing here?

01:15:38.205 --> 01:15:39.206
-: I'm done!

01:15:39.239 --> 01:15:41.208
I'm going to let this river
carry me northward

01:15:41.241 --> 01:15:45.646
to Canadia where I will start
anew amongst the moose.

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:50.417
-: Tucker, do you know why I
keep my glasses on?

01:15:50.451 --> 01:15:54.088
-: Yes, it was after a failed
corrective eye surgery

01:15:54.121 --> 01:15:55.656
that you did on yourself with a
laser pointer.

01:15:55.689 --> 01:15:58.525
-: Bah, that's just the party
line.

01:15:58.559 --> 01:16:01.628
In truth, my eyes work.

01:16:01.662 --> 01:16:02.463
-: What?

01:16:02.496 --> 01:16:06.166
-: They can reveal things in
people.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.035
I can't control it.

01:16:08.068 --> 01:16:10.471
And the emotional burden is...

01:16:10.504 --> 01:16:12.573
It's too much for me.

01:16:12.606 --> 01:16:14.875
So I keep myself blinded.

01:16:15.676 --> 01:16:19.079
Most people aren't ready for the
truth.

01:16:24.218 --> 01:16:26.387
-: I'm ready for my truth.

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.488
-: I know.

01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:30.124
(tense music)

01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:36.997
Buford: Have I told you about

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:40.367
my production of A Doll's House?

01:16:40.401 --> 01:16:45.406
Our first adaptation was devised
in the jungles of Siberia.

01:16:46.473 --> 01:16:49.443
("Siberia" echoing)

01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:53.213
(dramatic music)

01:17:29.516 --> 01:17:32.186
(upbeat music)

01:17:58.412 --> 01:18:01.148
(audience oohs)

01:18:05.252 --> 01:18:08.255
(audience applauds)

01:18:35.516 --> 01:18:36.350
(Sandrene sobs)

01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:37.417
Sandrene: I'm sorry.

01:18:37.451 --> 01:18:38.318
-: It's okay.

01:18:38.352 --> 01:18:41.655
-: I just feel so guilty and
ungrateful

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:46.126
and just a total asshole.

01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:48.695
Leaving all these people that I
love and care about.

01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:50.230
-: Look.

01:18:50.264 --> 01:18:52.566
If they really love you, they'll
understand

01:18:52.599 --> 01:18:54.735
that you've gotta follow your
dreams.

01:18:54.768 --> 01:18:56.470
And if they don't, then it
sounds to me

01:18:56.503 --> 01:18:59.506
like they got some growing up to
do.

01:19:00.374 --> 01:19:04.745
You are the most talented person
I've ever met.

01:19:04.778 --> 01:19:07.581
(dramatic music)

01:19:13.587 --> 01:19:14.421
Wow.

01:19:15.823 --> 01:19:17.424
That was so crazy.

01:19:19.192 --> 01:19:20.160
-: Yeah.

01:19:20.193 --> 01:19:24.131
-: I've been waiting for so long
for a sign.

01:19:24.164 --> 01:19:27.701
For some reason for me to get
out of here and this is it.

01:19:27.734 --> 01:19:30.604
I can come with you, I'll make
your place a home.

01:19:30.637 --> 01:19:35.642
You're gonna be so busy and you
need stability.

01:19:36.243 --> 01:19:36.878
-: Well--

01:19:36.911 --> 01:19:37.711
-: I can cook.

01:19:37.744 --> 01:19:39.546
I can clean, I can take care of
you.

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:40.714
Hell, maybe I can even figure
out

01:19:40.747 --> 01:19:41.849
the music scene in New York
City.

01:19:41.883 --> 01:19:43.818
-: Okay, Hank, Hank, hi.

01:19:46.486 --> 01:19:47.822
No.

01:19:47.855 --> 01:19:49.523
This is my journey.

01:19:50.757 --> 01:19:54.227
And if I have learned anything
it's that

01:19:55.662 --> 01:19:57.464
I can't have someone depending

01:19:57.497 --> 01:20:00.300
on me to give their life
meaning.

01:20:05.238 --> 01:20:06.106
Okay?

01:20:06.908 --> 01:20:07.774
-: Yeah.

01:20:11.913 --> 01:20:13.213
-: Guys guys guys!

01:20:13.246 --> 01:20:13.881
Okay.

01:20:13.915 --> 01:20:15.215
Uther, how did you get here?

01:20:15.248 --> 01:20:16.416
-: Uber.

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:17.284
-: Oh.

01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:19.653
Didn't know they had that.

01:20:19.686 --> 01:20:23.290
Look, I just, I wanted to say
that I am,

01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:26.660
I'm so sorry for all the
horrible

01:20:26.693 --> 01:20:30.597
eloquently-worded things that I
said earlier.

01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:34.234
I've come to the realization
that...

01:20:34.267 --> 01:20:37.872
I now understand the true
purpose of theater.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:41.642
It's about community, you know?

01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:43.878
And bringing people closer.

01:20:47.414 --> 01:20:51.284
Trying to figure out this crazy
life together.

01:20:53.687 --> 01:20:55.422
And I wanna be here.

01:20:57.391 --> 01:20:59.927
I wanna be a part of your
family.

01:20:59.961 --> 01:21:01.361
Your community.

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:10.838
-: No thanks, I think we're all
set.

01:21:10.872 --> 01:21:11.906
-: Yeah.

01:21:11.939 --> 01:21:13.908
I'm gonna help Yorick get his
distilling license

01:21:13.941 --> 01:21:16.376
so that he can sell his
moonshine legally.

01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:18.311
Proceeds will go to Tankhouse.

01:21:18.345 --> 01:21:18.980
-: What?

01:21:19.013 --> 01:21:20.114
Wait, what?

01:21:20.148 --> 01:21:24.584
-: We are turning Tankhouse into
our permanent theater.

01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:26.420
-: That's.

01:21:27.521 --> 01:21:29.356
Amazing.

01:21:33.527 --> 01:21:36.864
If you could just find a place
for me here,

01:21:36.898 --> 01:21:40.001
I would be eternally grateful.

01:21:40.034 --> 01:21:42.837
(dramatic music)

01:21:44.404 --> 01:21:48.475
-: You know, someone once told
me a stage

01:21:48.508 --> 01:21:51.813
is where you arrive, not where
you begin.

01:21:53.848 --> 01:21:55.782
If you want to join us.

01:21:56.884 --> 01:21:59.653
You'll have to audition.

01:21:59.686 --> 01:22:02.389
-: Just like everyone else?

01:22:02.422 --> 01:22:04.558
-: Just like everyone else.

01:22:06.393 --> 01:22:07.260
-: Yes.

01:22:09.496 --> 01:22:10.363
-: Okay.

01:22:12.332 --> 01:22:13.835
Sign me up.

01:22:13.868 --> 01:22:16.536
(Uther laughs)

01:22:21.508 --> 01:22:22.810
-: Oi!

01:22:22.844 --> 01:22:24.544
Everyone!

01:22:24.578 --> 01:22:26.313
To Tankhouse!

01:22:26.346 --> 01:22:28.415
Patrons: To Tankhouse!

01:22:29.449 --> 01:22:30.450
-: Tankhouse.

01:22:31.853 --> 01:22:34.521
(upbeat music)

01:22:39.359 --> 01:22:40.494
-: Ooh!

01:22:40.527 --> 01:22:41.661
I am so sorry.

01:22:42.897 --> 01:22:47.068
Tonight is our opening night of
"Art Assault"

01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:48.769
An immersive show that we've
been

01:22:48.802 --> 01:22:51.873
working on the past few weeks.

01:22:51.906 --> 01:22:54.041
-: I was given a more
instrumental part

01:22:54.075 --> 01:22:55.675
in the production since Sandrene

01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:57.711
had to leave to shoot her show.

01:22:57.744 --> 01:22:59.513
It was a little awkward at first

01:22:59.546 --> 01:23:03.316
because Tucker kept forgetting I
wasn't Sandrene.

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:05.285
-: I'll take care of it.

01:23:06.453 --> 01:23:07.320
Whoa!

01:23:08.688 --> 01:23:09.656
I forgot.

01:23:09.689 --> 01:23:11.792
-: I heard she's coming to the
show tonight.

01:23:11.826 --> 01:23:13.928
-: Yeah, we're back together.

01:23:13.961 --> 01:23:14.795
-: Boing!

01:23:14.829 --> 01:23:15.729
-: On one condition.

01:23:15.762 --> 01:23:16.563
-: Our one rule is I'm not
really supposed

01:23:16.596 --> 01:23:18.732
to talk about him in my standup,
so.

01:23:18.765 --> 01:23:19.934
-: Yeah.

01:23:19.967 --> 01:23:21.035
-: So I'm hanging with my
girlfriend

01:23:21.068 --> 01:23:22.569
the other day, sucking her dick.

01:23:22.602 --> 01:23:25.672
(audience laughs)

01:23:25.705 --> 01:23:26.540
Future mother-in-law everybody.

01:23:26.573 --> 01:23:29.476
Give it up for Pauline, police
captain.

01:23:29.509 --> 01:23:31.078
-: We weren't able to get the
licensing

01:23:31.112 --> 01:23:33.915
for my moonshine, but we were
able to use

01:23:33.948 --> 01:23:38.085
the equipment to make a cologne
designed by Uther.

01:23:39.053 --> 01:23:43.024
Turns out his crazy sense of
smells does come in handy.

01:23:43.057 --> 01:23:47.028
We got it in all the duty frees!

01:23:48.129 --> 01:23:49.931
-: So since the competition I've

01:23:49.964 --> 01:23:52.399
taken over as technical
director.

01:23:52.432 --> 01:23:54.969
That's why it's so neat in here.

01:23:57.038 --> 01:24:00.640
-: After some self-reflection,
and Leah sitting me down

01:24:00.674 --> 01:24:03.643
and explaining to me how I'm
part of "the problem,"

01:24:03.677 --> 01:24:05.478
I decided I needed to take a
step back

01:24:05.512 --> 01:24:07.781
from leadership for a while.

01:24:10.084 --> 01:24:12.752
So I demoted myself to squire.

01:24:15.622 --> 01:24:16.723
Scroll for you, sir!

01:24:16.756 --> 01:24:17.757
-: Thank you, good sir.

01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:18.725
-: Good day!

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.098
Nina: This is why we have spell
check.

01:24:33.074 --> 01:24:34.275
-: Oh.

01:24:34.308 --> 01:24:37.544
So I've been taking an
experimental acting class at
CCM.

01:24:37.577 --> 01:24:39.914
So I had to come see Art
Assault.

01:24:39.947 --> 01:24:42.482
Once I confronted my dad about
the whole

01:24:42.515 --> 01:24:46.187
sense memory exercise, he
finally came out to me.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:49.190
But yeah, he and Jim should be
here any second.

01:24:49.223 --> 01:24:52.425
(rhythmic babbling)

01:24:55.495 --> 01:24:57.098
-: Beat the chest!

01:24:57.131 --> 01:24:59.532
King Kong the chest, yes.

01:24:59.566 --> 01:25:00.500
-: Sandrene?

01:25:02.103 --> 01:25:04.771
Sandrene: Hey guys!

01:25:04.804 --> 01:25:06.506
Brady: How are you?

01:25:06.539 --> 01:25:08.508
Sandrene: I missed you so much!

01:25:08.541 --> 01:25:10.510
Nina: You looks so pretty.

01:25:10.543 --> 01:25:12.512
You really got that CW glow.

01:25:12.545 --> 01:25:15.149
(actors chatter)

01:25:19.253 --> 01:25:20.754
-: I've missed you guys.

01:25:20.787 --> 01:25:22.656
-: We've missed you too.

01:25:22.689 --> 01:25:24.791
-: I love your romper.

01:25:24.825 --> 01:25:28.695
-: Let's all take five in the
antechamber, huh?

01:25:29.897 --> 01:25:31.999
Take me, thank you.

01:25:32.033 --> 01:25:33.935
I just wanted to give them a
little space.

01:25:33.968 --> 01:25:37.771
Nina: Actually it's time to
hydrate, guys.

01:25:39.506 --> 01:25:40.141
-: Hi.

01:25:40.174 --> 01:25:41.775
-: Hey 'Drene.

01:25:41.809 --> 01:25:44.979
I was just counting the chairs
for the...

01:25:45.012 --> 01:25:47.815
(dramatic music)

01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.891
-: How's the show?

01:25:56.924 --> 01:25:58.658
-: Good, good, yeah, really
good.

01:25:58.692 --> 01:25:59.592
Great actually.

01:25:59.626 --> 01:26:03.264
Jack, he's really come out of
his shell.

01:26:03.297 --> 01:26:05.665
Leah has a beautiful movement
piece

01:26:05.699 --> 01:26:08.002
about cryptic pregnancies that
came to her

01:26:08.035 --> 01:26:11.906
in a dream actually, so yeah,
it's great.

01:26:11.939 --> 01:26:14.842
-: Look at you giving the actors
freedom.

01:26:14.875 --> 01:26:15.742
It's nice.

01:26:18.645 --> 01:26:19.847
-: What about you?

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.148
How's your... show?

01:26:22.716 --> 01:26:23.750
-: It's great.

01:26:23.783 --> 01:26:26.120
We just finished filming the
first two episodes.

01:26:26.153 --> 01:26:27.587
Learning a lot.

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:28.956
The cast is cool.

01:26:32.759 --> 01:26:36.263
-: Are you gonna go see Hank
after this, or...

01:26:36.297 --> 01:26:37.131
-: What?

01:26:37.164 --> 01:26:38.032
No.

01:26:38.065 --> 01:26:39.699
No, Tucker.

01:26:39.733 --> 01:26:42.569
He's just trying to find himself

01:26:42.602 --> 01:26:44.138
Like the rest of us.

01:26:48.675 --> 01:26:51.112
I'm really happy though.

01:26:51.145 --> 01:26:52.813
I hope you are too.

01:27:00.754 --> 01:27:02.689
-: I really do miss you.

01:27:05.326 --> 01:27:06.626
Nina: Oh hey, Tucker?

01:27:06.659 --> 01:27:07.895
-: Ah, Nina.

01:27:07.928 --> 01:27:08.996
What news bring you?

01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:11.731
-: Sorry, it's just we have to
open the house now.

01:27:11.765 --> 01:27:14.601
It's company members only.

01:27:14.634 --> 01:27:16.569
-: Oh my god, of course.

01:27:18.839 --> 01:27:21.075
Break a leg, you guys.

01:27:21.108 --> 01:27:23.177
