WEBVTT

00:07.441 --> 00:10.410
<i>They told me,</i>
<i>but I had no idea.</i>

01:37.899 --> 01:41.101
Yeah. Yeah, it's coming.

01:56.017 --> 01:57.384
What is that sound?

01:58.185 --> 01:59.587
They're cheering him on.

02:14.267 --> 02:17.071
Juan Miguel Prado,
you have been sentenced to die

02:17.137 --> 02:18.506
by the state of Oklahoma

02:18.573 --> 02:22.610
for the triple homicides
of November 12th, 2013.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.312
Do you have any last words?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.525
This is only the beginning.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.512
You couldn't wait?

04:06.748 --> 04:09.617
Jesus, you look like shit.
Whoa, I've been up all night.

04:10.151 --> 04:11.418
You went?

04:12.053 --> 04:13.187
Fucking unbelievable.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.455
Sandy, can I have
my usual please?

04:15.823 --> 04:17.692
Oh, and get him
some more coffee.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.493
Coming right up.

04:20.128 --> 04:21.195
How's Emma?

04:21.394 --> 04:22.730
She's good.

04:22.797 --> 04:23.965
I told her
you're gonna be there tonight.

04:24.165 --> 04:27.568
You know,
I love her, but not that much.

04:27.835 --> 04:28.636
Think about it.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.038
<i>...what has been</i>
<i>a rocky week for Governor Jeffs,</i>

04:31.105 --> 04:33.306
<i>amid allegations of corruption</i>

04:33.373 --> 04:36.177
<i>relating to the oil industry</i>
<i>and political favors.</i>

04:36.476 --> 04:38.378
<i>This morning,</i>
<i>the governor followed through</i>

04:38.445 --> 04:40.447
<i>on his promise of law and order.</i>

04:40.515 --> 04:44.252
<i>Cartel Under boss Juan</i>
<i>Miguel Prado was executed,</i>

04:44.484 --> 04:47.221
<i>in what was the state's</i>
<i>first capital punishment case</i>

04:47.320 --> 04:48.890
<i>in more than seven years.</i>

04:48.956 --> 04:52.359
<i>Governor Jeffs, then prosecutor,</i>
<i>was in attendance</i>

04:52.693 --> 04:54.896
<i>and is holding</i>
<i>a press conference now.</i>

04:55.328 --> 04:57.064
Fuck is he doing?

04:57.799 --> 04:58.599
Shouldn't you be there?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.002
He's running the show now.
He's the boy wonder, remember?

05:01.102 --> 05:02.236
We dad a deal, Billie.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.771
<i>What I witnessed</i>
<i>this morning</i>

05:03.905 --> 05:06.541
<i>was the state exercising</i>
<i>its right to capital punishment.</i>

05:06.674 --> 05:08.308
<i>Mr. Governor,</i>
<i>will you address the...</i>

05:08.441 --> 05:10.678
I need to tell you
this is gonna be a problem.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.579
This is not good.

05:11.813 --> 05:14.215
He's gotta look tough
on crime and the Cartel.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.917
People are scared, Doc.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.552
We just executed Prado's brother

05:17.618 --> 05:19.153
and now he's gonna
take a victory lap.

05:19.220 --> 05:20.788
You gotta talk to this guy.

05:20.855 --> 05:22.389
You know him.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.258
Guys like this will sell
their children to win.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.795
What do you want me
to say, huh?

05:28.896 --> 05:30.497
Are you seeing them today?

05:30.765 --> 05:35.002
Yeah.
Okay, so we don't know
what we don't know.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.572
You'll see them
and then we'll go from there.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.541
"We don't know
what we don't know"?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.677
<i>Mr. Governor,</i>
<i>will you address</i>

05:42.977 --> 05:45.478
<i>the corruption allegations</i>
<i>reported against you this week?</i>

05:45.880 --> 05:48.049
<i>Reports that</i>
<i>you were directly compensated</i>

05:48.115 --> 05:50.218
<i>for the Keystone deals?</i>
<i>Those claims are baseless.</i>

05:50.284 --> 05:52.587
<i>Next question.</i>
<i>Mr. Governor,</i>
<i>why did you feel</i>

05:52.687 --> 05:54.555
<i>you had to attend</i>
<i>the execution?</i>

05:55.857 --> 05:58.226
<i>Well I was the prosecutor</i>
<i>in the Prado case.</i>

05:58.793 --> 06:01.929
<i>I felt like I owed it</i>
<i>to the families of his victims</i>

06:01.996 --> 06:04.497
<i>and to Mr. Prado, to see</i>
<i>this through to the end.</i>

06:04.565 --> 06:05.867
<i>What did</i>
<i>you owe Mr. Prado?</i>

06:05.933 --> 06:09.770
<i>As a reminder to him</i>
<i>and to his brother, Lalo Prado,</i>

06:09.937 --> 06:12.439
<i>and his heinous</i>
<i>criminal organization,</i>

06:13.841 --> 06:16.911
<i>that this state</i>
<i>and this great country</i>

06:17.178 --> 06:18.646
<i>won't stand for their kind.</i>

06:22.116 --> 06:23.818
<i>With this new Task Force,</i>

06:24.585 --> 06:26.287
<i>I'm going to make it my mission</i>

06:26.354 --> 06:28.488
<i>to eradicate</i>
<i>the Cartel's presence here,</i>

06:28.556 --> 06:30.490
<i>specifically Lalo Prado.</i>

06:31.458 --> 06:33.361
<i>Today's execution</i>
<i>was the first step.</i>

06:36.664 --> 06:39.066
<i>Next time I'm in that room,</i>
<i>it'll be Lalo on the table,</i>

06:39.133 --> 06:40.433
<i>getting the needle.</i>

08:28.109 --> 08:31.946
The United States
doesn't own its people, Lalo.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.619
Let me do this,
Brother.

09:17.358 --> 09:18.793
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:20.094 --> 09:22.730
- You wanna get some donuts?
- Please.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.672
- You look tired.
- I am.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.108
- How's the drinking?
- It's good.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.578
How's your mom?

09:37.845 --> 09:40.848
Fine.

09:40.915 --> 09:42.383
Did you get an attorney yet?

09:42.616 --> 09:44.218
Why you don't like
these secret meetings?

09:44.285 --> 09:46.821
Dad.
Yes, I have an attorney.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.723
Have you thought about
where you wanna go?

09:50.624 --> 09:52.059
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:52.493 --> 09:54.563
The mountains,
the beach, the moon, what?

09:54.628 --> 09:57.364
It's expensive.
I've been saving up.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.035
- I have a presentation tonight.
- About what?

10:01.335 --> 10:04.238
I did it on you
and what it's like to have a dad

10:04.305 --> 10:05.739
who served in the CIA.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.209
Special Forces, baby.

10:09.009 --> 10:09.810
Right.

10:10.244 --> 10:12.646
Well it's... it's just
a little different, that's all.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.050
Think she'd let you come?

10:17.985 --> 10:18.986
No.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.255
Maybe you can video it.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.097
I love you kiddo.
I love you too.

10:30.164 --> 10:32.099
Don't let them
corrupt you in there.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.935
Good luck, later.

12:05.059 --> 12:08.128
Just as you said, no problem.

12:11.265 --> 12:14.235
Escorts picked them up
when they crossed the Red River.

12:16.571 --> 12:17.672
What about tomorrow?

12:17.871 --> 12:19.240
We'll be ready.

12:20.374 --> 12:22.776
I have a new crew
coming in this evening

12:22.843 --> 12:24.311
to pack everything back up.

12:27.982 --> 12:29.817
I assume you saw the news.

12:31.553 --> 12:32.753
Oh, I did.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.292
I thought we had
an understanding.

12:40.528 --> 12:41.795
I thought the same.

12:49.704 --> 12:51.138
We know you did.

12:56.010 --> 12:57.512
Let's just get through tomorrow.

13:01.382 --> 13:02.383
<i>VÃ¡monos.</i>

13:31.145 --> 13:32.479
Hey, buddy!

13:35.617 --> 13:36.884
Put that thing out.

13:41.723 --> 13:43.290
What are you fucking crazy?

13:47.595 --> 13:49.363
You gonna try
to kill us all here?

13:56.538 --> 13:58.038
Fucking Mexicans.

14:09.083 --> 14:13.454
Whiskey.

14:17.191 --> 14:18.892
Thank you.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.198
<i>I was surprised</i>
<i>you showed up.</i>

14:24.465 --> 14:25.567
Well, I tried not to.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.202
I do not know
how you do these things.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.238
After 30 years of campaigns,
you figure it out.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.041
How's little Nellie?

14:34.108 --> 14:36.644
Oh, she ain't so little.
She's good though.

14:36.778 --> 14:39.614
She's a smart kid.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.517
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.387
Billie told me
she's gonna help out

14:46.453 --> 14:49.189
on the custody case.
Yeah, that's the plan.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.193
Well, you don't go over there
and do what you did,

14:53.994 --> 14:55.963
and then come back in one piece.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.900
She should realize that...

15:01.335 --> 15:03.203
you can't keep
a girl from her dad.

15:05.507 --> 15:06.508
You showed.

15:07.675 --> 15:09.977
I'm here for her, not you.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.313
Honey, do you
want another one?

15:13.380 --> 15:15.015
No, thank you.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.384
Can I get a minute?

15:27.261 --> 15:29.196
They're gonna respond, Billie.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.032
Yeah. What did he say?

15:32.534 --> 15:35.102
Nothing. Which is worse.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.574
Okay. So what do you wanna do?

15:39.940 --> 15:42.009
Talk to Rich,
tell him to cool it

15:42.075 --> 15:43.645
with the white knight
bullshit, all right?

15:45.078 --> 15:46.614
I don't even wanna think
about what they're gonna do.

15:46.681 --> 15:48.683
- You can't do that.
- Why?

15:49.950 --> 15:51.151
Well, you can.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.420
But he doesn't
know everything.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.122
So--
What doesn't he know?

15:55.757 --> 15:58.091
He doesn't wanna know,
that's the agreement.

15:59.026 --> 16:02.196
What doesn't he know, Billie?
Oh, come on Doc.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.366
I've had my arm
up the ass of people like Jeffs

16:06.433 --> 16:10.037
for the past 30 fucking years.
They get to put on their hats

16:10.103 --> 16:11.806
and wave to everyone
from the parade floats,

16:11.940 --> 16:14.141
but they're bouncing
on my fucking knee.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.278
He may be a war hero
in your world,

16:19.213 --> 16:22.983
but here in mine,
Jeffs knows what I tell him.

16:23.585 --> 16:24.586
Right.

16:27.822 --> 16:29.356
What haven't you told me,
Billie?

16:38.867 --> 16:40.100
Clarke?

16:54.983 --> 16:57.084
Doc.
Clarke.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.054
Six-hundred a plate,
I'm surprised to see you here.

17:01.154 --> 17:05.224
Need to talk to Rich.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.864
Tonight is a busy night, Doc.

17:10.565 --> 17:11.566
Why don't you call
my office tomorrow,

17:11.833 --> 17:13.568
maybe we can schedule
a meeting for next week, huh?

17:15.234 --> 17:17.104
It needs to be tonight Clarke.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.840
What didn't you understand?
The answer is no.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.512
Look at me, look at me.

17:24.579 --> 17:27.079
Listen to me
you little fucking turd.

17:28.016 --> 17:30.852
The answer is,
"I'll go get him, Doc."

17:30.985 --> 17:36.290
I'll go get him Doc,
I'll go get him.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.671
What is it?
Clarke said it couldn't wait.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.509
Go ahead, Billie.

17:55.877 --> 17:57.545
Damn it.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.446
It's the Prado thing.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.916
We need you to back down
from the Task Force

18:01.983 --> 18:03.585
and let this whole thing
die down a bit.

18:04.018 --> 18:05.252
Why would I do that?

18:06.119 --> 18:07.454
I just announced it.

18:08.056 --> 18:09.423
Remember when you were running,

18:10.357 --> 18:12.026
"Whatever needs
to be done," right?

18:12.125 --> 18:15.128
I told you whatever it is,
I didn't want to know.

18:15.429 --> 18:16.598
Where do you think those large,

18:16.664 --> 18:18.498
anonymous contributions
came from,

18:18.666 --> 18:20.969
or the overwhelming
Hispanic vote, huh?

18:21.536 --> 18:24.038
Those things aren't won
at the fucking wishing well.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.238
What are you saying?

18:25.573 --> 18:28.408
That we have
a few partners in this thing.

18:29.877 --> 18:30.878
Prado?

18:34.114 --> 18:35.617
How does this happen?

18:36.985 --> 18:38.452
I'm the sitting
fucking governor.

18:38.519 --> 18:40.588
Everyone makes
their deal with the devil.

18:40.655 --> 18:41.956
This one is yours.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.358
What does he expect
from this deal you made?

18:44.592 --> 18:47.294
We look the other way on things
concerning his interests.

18:47.629 --> 18:49.329
What the fuck
are you saying to me?

18:49.396 --> 18:52.165
Not all, just some,
he's practical.

18:52.567 --> 18:54.368
And most you don't need
to be aware of

18:54.434 --> 18:55.503
because you have Doc and I.

18:55.570 --> 18:57.872
I mean, you hired
me to fucking win.

19:00.742 --> 19:04.779
Don't look
so shocked, Richard.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.081
Naive doesn't look good on you.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.117
We just executed his brother.

19:09.517 --> 19:11.284
You kill three civilians,
you get the needle,

19:11.351 --> 19:12.553
that's the deal.

19:13.054 --> 19:15.155
Lalo knew
we couldn't save his brother,

19:15.523 --> 19:18.593
but I told you, don't dance
on his fucking grave.

19:19.093 --> 19:22.429
Look, this is just a pit stop.
We thread the needle here

19:22.563 --> 19:24.364
then we get to D.C.
after one term.

19:24.532 --> 19:26.567
Don't shit your pants on me now.

19:26.634 --> 19:28.503
And with this Keystone thing...

19:33.541 --> 19:35.275
So...

19:37.244 --> 19:39.781
what do you advise
that I do now, Billie?

19:46.721 --> 19:49.891
Doc, can we have a minute?

20:04.105 --> 20:05.540
Clarke, fuck off.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.407
Yes.

20:11.713 --> 20:15.348
Hey, Doc.

20:16.416 --> 20:20.353
Hey Taylor. How's football?
Good. How's Nell?

20:20.855 --> 20:23.791
Oh, she's good.
Said to say hi, if I saw you.

20:24.625 --> 20:26.594
Tell her I say hi back.
I will.

20:29.063 --> 20:30.131
Get some rest, Doc.

20:30.198 --> 20:32.365
Taylor.
Yeah.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.770
Oh, yeah,
exactly, thank you.

20:35.837 --> 20:37.237
Yep.
You leaving already?

20:37.638 --> 20:39.207
Not gonna stick around
for a drink?

20:39.306 --> 20:40.407
No, I can't.

20:40.675 --> 20:41.876
Did they actually,
let you through the front door

20:42.009 --> 20:44.377
with this outfit on?
Yeah, I wish they hadn't, Karl.

20:45.046 --> 20:46.848
You look good though.
You too.

20:47.014 --> 20:48.381
I'll call you tomorrow.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.052
Hey Doc, it's good
seeing you man.

20:51.219 --> 20:52.887
- You, too.
- Love you bro.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.290
I love Doc, don't you?

20:57.457 --> 20:58.626
I do.
Hold on a sec.

20:58.693 --> 21:00.293
Talk to your client, Karl.

21:07.969 --> 21:09.036
Hey, Doc.

21:10.838 --> 21:11.839
Listen, uh...

21:13.406 --> 21:15.843
I just wanted
to thank you, you know,

21:15.977 --> 21:18.946
I know how fucked up this all is
and all that you do for us.

21:19.013 --> 21:20.413
I know it's not always pretty.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.351
Rich, Rich, Rich,
it's me. Cut the shit, man.

21:25.653 --> 21:27.354
Listen to what Billie's saying.

21:28.756 --> 21:30.658
Back down on the Lalo thing,
man, all right,

21:30.725 --> 21:33.928
I can't protect you,
I can't protect your family.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.933
You worry too much.

21:42.870 --> 21:44.772
It's too bad
we're not as close anymore.

21:48.009 --> 21:49.010
Is it?

22:28.516 --> 22:30.551
- Hello?
<i>- Are you sleeping?</i>

22:32.286 --> 22:33.888
- No.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

22:36.356 --> 22:37.625
What is it?

22:38.159 --> 22:40.561
<i>I was calling</i>
<i>to see if you'll be</i>

22:40.628 --> 22:41.863
<i>in court this week.</i>

22:42.495 --> 22:45.566
Yeah, I'm gonna be in court.

22:47.068 --> 22:48.135
Is that why you called?

22:48.703 --> 22:50.470
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Oh.

22:51.572 --> 22:55.776
Look Carla, my bills are paid.
I slept at home last night.

22:55.877 --> 22:58.679
Laundry's getting done
over here.

22:58.779 --> 23:00.581
You wanna let a judge decide,
it's fine,

23:00.681 --> 23:02.216
I'm not gonna fight you on it.

23:02.884 --> 23:05.385
I just wanna be part
of her life, okay?

23:06.120 --> 23:07.889
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Okay.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.423
Is there anything else?

23:10.524 --> 23:12.593
Because otherwise
I have to get to work.

23:13.761 --> 23:15.296
<i>Yeah, where's work?</i>

23:15.563 --> 23:19.399
Okay.
I'll see you in court.

23:26.374 --> 23:27.742
<i>Hey Dad, it's me,</i>

23:27.808 --> 23:30.311
<i>just calling to tell you</i>
<i>the presentation went great</i>

23:30.378 --> 23:32.313
<i>and everyone loved it.</i>

23:32.680 --> 23:34.414
<i>Um, I'll tell you more</i>
<i>about it tomorrow,</i>

23:34.515 --> 23:35.950
<i>same time, same place?</i>

23:36.317 --> 23:37.518
<i>Love you.</i>

24:16.891 --> 24:17.925
Billie?

25:18.586 --> 25:19.920
<i>Call Clarke Moore.</i>

25:26.927 --> 25:29.730
<i>What Doc?</i>
We need to meet.

25:29.797 --> 25:31.332
<i>Why would we do that?</i>

25:31.999 --> 25:34.869
Cut the shit, Clarke.
Put me through to Rich.

25:35.703 --> 25:37.038
<i>Listen, Doc,</i>

25:37.104 --> 25:40.207
<i>whatever arrangement you had</i>
<i>with the governor is gone now.</i>

25:41.409 --> 25:42.576
Is that right?

25:42.810 --> 25:45.479
<i>The governor has decided</i>
<i>to end this relationship.</i>

25:45.813 --> 25:47.081
<i>He wishes you well.</i>

25:47.148 --> 25:49.216
It doesn't work
that way, motherfucker.

25:49.283 --> 25:50.217
Put me through now.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.485
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>more to talk about, Doc.</i>

25:51.552 --> 25:54.155
Clarke! Put me fucking through.

25:54.688 --> 25:56.957
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>you're on your own now.</i>

25:58.359 --> 26:00.361
Fuck, fuck!

26:21.649 --> 26:24.185
Three-thousand pounds
in 48 hours...

26:25.186 --> 26:26.187
<i>not bad.</i>

26:27.021 --> 26:29.890
This is Cuco,
he just came in from Mexico.

26:35.930 --> 26:38.933
I was sorry to hear
about Riggs and her wife.

26:40.468 --> 26:41.669
Truly.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.121
All right.

27:00.589 --> 27:02.223
Go get
some rest, <i>cabrÃ³n.</i>

27:25.446 --> 27:26.814
Police, freeze!

29:55.129 --> 29:56.430
Hey.

31:31.392 --> 31:32.192
Hey, pal.

31:32.594 --> 31:33.994
- Great to see you, Rich.
- Good to see you.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.797
Hey, long time no see,
how you been?

31:35.864 --> 31:37.231
Nice to see you.
Good, good.

31:37.498 --> 31:39.099
So, what do we got?

31:39.166 --> 31:41.101
Well, we've got
1,500 pounds of dope

31:41.368 --> 31:44.071
and 11 million dollars seized.
What's next?

31:44.606 --> 31:46.907
Well, now it's a question
of you and your family's safety.

31:47.107 --> 31:48.510
We've upped
your personal detail,

31:48.743 --> 31:50.745
but we need to be careful.

31:50.845 --> 31:52.847
Move my wife and son
out of the mansion.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.682
Put a team
with them at all times,

31:54.816 --> 31:56.316
just until
this thing calms down.

31:56.450 --> 31:58.018
I was so sorry to hear
about Billie Riggs, sir.

31:58.686 --> 32:00.154
It's just terrible
what happened.

32:00.387 --> 32:03.056
How do you figure
she factors into this?

32:03.525 --> 32:04.692
I can't think of a reason.

32:04.759 --> 32:05.993
Do you know
an associate of hers,

32:06.059 --> 32:07.327
by the name of Doc Alexander?

32:07.829 --> 32:09.062
Yes, yeah, I do.

32:09.564 --> 32:11.465
We have reason to believe
that he is connected

32:11.533 --> 32:12.767
to the Prado organization.

32:13.233 --> 32:14.702
What makes you think that?

32:14.903 --> 32:16.805
Well, he was the only one
that showed up

32:16.871 --> 32:18.439
for Prado's brother's execution.

32:18.506 --> 32:21.175
He also matches
the description of an individual

32:21.241 --> 32:22.943
leaving the warehouse
earlier today.

32:23.678 --> 32:26.648
Doc was my superior officer,
we served together.

32:27.749 --> 32:30.350
I know him to be a troubled man.

32:31.318 --> 32:35.155
If you think
he's connected to the Prados...

32:36.290 --> 32:37.792
we have to consider
him dangerous...

32:38.593 --> 32:41.295
and do whatever we need
to do to apprehend him.

32:43.430 --> 32:44.498
Okay.

32:45.767 --> 32:46.967
We ready?

32:49.336 --> 32:50.772
Hey, Rich,
can you give me a second?

32:50.839 --> 32:52.841
What is it? I'll catch up.

32:54.776 --> 32:56.443
Are we sure we wanna do this?

32:57.377 --> 33:00.047
I mean, you go back on camera...

33:01.315 --> 33:04.586
and we're at war.
Clarke, we already are.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.154
What was that about Doc
in there?

33:07.221 --> 33:08.489
Doc's on his own now.

33:09.089 --> 33:11.158
That's how this thing goes.

33:11.225 --> 33:15.462
Now we have to protect
everything we've worked for.

33:15.563 --> 33:17.732
After that, we're clean.

33:19.099 --> 33:20.768
You knew this was gonna happen,
didn't you?

33:21.001 --> 33:23.303
No, I didn't.
People are dead, Rich.

33:23.738 --> 33:26.073
Look, Billie knew the stakes
better than anyone.

33:26.541 --> 33:27.575
Emma?

33:28.408 --> 33:29.409
Those cops?

33:29.711 --> 33:30.778
It's horrible.

33:31.478 --> 33:33.848
But there's no going back,
Clarke.

33:34.114 --> 33:35.683
And I'm really sorry about that.

33:36.350 --> 33:39.521
Right now, I need to know
that I can count on you.

33:41.455 --> 33:45.927
Hey, we are going to take on
the Cartel and win, Clarke.

33:48.796 --> 33:49.797
Let's go.

33:53.868 --> 33:54.869
It's all in here.

33:55.068 --> 33:57.170
Stick to the script.
We're gonna get touched up.

34:17.157 --> 34:19.259
Good evening, Oklahoma.

34:20.494 --> 34:22.262
He's traveling next week.

34:24.831 --> 34:27.067
No. Are you watching the press--

34:28.670 --> 34:30.638
Education is fucking Oklahoma.

34:31.706 --> 34:33.340
No, he's running on crime.

34:34.174 --> 34:35.743
Yeah, well the numbers
are the numbers.

34:36.777 --> 34:38.646
Look, I can't get into it.
I got an early morning,

34:38.746 --> 34:39.813
I gotta jump.

34:55.128 --> 34:56.731
Oh, what the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

34:56.797 --> 34:58.198
Shut your fucking mouth.

34:58.465 --> 34:59.466
Okay, okay, okay.

34:59.701 --> 35:01.268
Please, please, please,
don't hurt me, please.

35:01.569 --> 35:03.470
Put your hands above your head.

35:03.905 --> 35:05.138
What, why?

35:05.907 --> 35:10.110
Put your hands
above your head now.

35:10.177 --> 35:12.080
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

35:14.716 --> 35:15.516
Oh, my God, no.

35:15.717 --> 35:16.951
Okay, hey, listen,
I'll do whatever you want.

35:17.552 --> 35:19.854
I'll get you anything you want
just please don't hurt me.
Shh.

35:24.358 --> 35:27.595
That's a good boy. Shh.

35:27.829 --> 35:30.230
What is going on?

35:31.966 --> 35:33.266
Hey man, look.

35:33.333 --> 35:36.136
Hey, I had nothing to do
with it, with any of it, okay.

35:36.269 --> 35:37.337
I don't even know
what's going on,

35:37.404 --> 35:38.405
I don't! I don't know.

35:38.506 --> 35:40.307
What does he think he's doing?

35:42.142 --> 35:43.511
Jeffs?

35:44.277 --> 35:45.747
Man,
he wants to take on the Cartel.

35:47.081 --> 35:48.683
Now people
are fucking dying and...

35:49.751 --> 35:52.987
I just wanted to work
in politics. Please.

35:53.655 --> 35:56.323
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

35:57.025 --> 35:58.593
But they just
upped the security.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.329
I have an idea.
Uncuff me and I can call him.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.231
Okay, I'll call him
and we can set up a meeting,

36:04.632 --> 36:07.167
right away, I promise,
I'll get you a meeting with him.

36:11.139 --> 36:12.907
Do you pray, Clarke?

36:13.206 --> 36:16.044
What? No, what the fuck
does that mean?

36:16.778 --> 36:19.147
I'm gonna give you a minute
to get right with God.

36:19.681 --> 36:22.850
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, please.

36:23.051 --> 36:25.720
Help me! Help!

36:25.920 --> 36:31.926
Help me! Help! No!

36:31.993 --> 36:34.595
Please.

36:35.930 --> 36:38.265
No!

36:38.432 --> 36:41.736
Oh, my God!

36:47.709 --> 36:51.813
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
no, oh, my God.

37:41.261 --> 37:42.530
Yeah.

37:42.997 --> 37:43.998
<i>Hello, Doc.</i>

37:44.799 --> 37:48.301
- Who the fuck is this?
<i>- Your girl is here.</i>

37:49.003 --> 37:51.338
What? Where is she?

37:52.673 --> 37:54.876
<i>Relax, she's-- she's fine.</i>

37:56.276 --> 37:58.278
You fucking touch her,
I swear to God I'll--

37:58.813 --> 38:00.581
<i>You fucking listen to me.</i>
<i>You listen to me--</i>

38:00.648 --> 38:04.051
No,
you listen to me, okay?

38:06.754 --> 38:07.955
Doc.

38:09.223 --> 38:10.858
<i>I need your help,</i> Jefe.

38:12.593 --> 38:16.363
I came here to send a message.
Now our money is gone,

38:16.631 --> 38:17.899
<i>our men, our product.</i>

38:17.965 --> 38:20.367
I had nothing to do
with what you lost.

38:21.301 --> 38:22.537
<i>I believe you.</i>

38:23.971 --> 38:26.040
But that doesn't change
where we are.

38:27.175 --> 38:29.210
<i>How long have you</i>
<i>known Mr. Jeffs?</i>

38:29.744 --> 38:32.312
I've known him 20 years,
but I don't know him anymore.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.015
<i>What do you want?</i>

38:34.615 --> 38:36.818
And I've read a lot
about your state.

38:37.752 --> 38:39.821
They've executed
a lot of people.

38:41.622 --> 38:43.791
And it's the only one
that offers more than two forms

38:43.858 --> 38:47.360
besides lethal injection
and electrocution.

38:48.328 --> 38:50.531
And they always start
at the same time?

38:53.568 --> 38:54.869
<i>I asked you a question.</i>

38:57.738 --> 38:58.806
Midnight.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.043
<i>Midnight.</i>
<i>That's what I heard.</i>

39:04.745 --> 39:05.880
Kind of poetic.

39:08.216 --> 39:10.483
What do you want?

39:12.286 --> 39:13.654
<i>My father's people</i>

39:14.322 --> 39:16.389
from the Southern part
of Mexico,

39:17.625 --> 39:19.359
descendants of Mayans.

39:20.761 --> 39:22.495
<i>For their culture,</i>
<i>the greatest offering</i>

39:22.563 --> 39:23.998
<i>was the head of your enemy.</i>

39:29.670 --> 39:31.639
I want the head
of Richard Jeffs.

39:33.875 --> 39:34.909
Head?

39:35.877 --> 39:37.011
<i>Just the head.</i>

39:39.013 --> 39:42.183
If you bring me what I want,
I will give you the girl,

39:42.516 --> 39:44.384
that is the price for her life.

39:45.385 --> 39:46.954
<i>Call this number</i>
<i>when you have it.</i>

39:47.722 --> 39:49.056
<i>I'll give you</i>
<i>instructions from there.</i>

39:49.123 --> 39:51.759
I'm not gonna do a goddamn thing
until I know she's okay.

39:52.827 --> 39:53.961
<i>Okay.</i>

39:55.363 --> 39:57.464
<i>Ask me something</i>
<i>only she would know.</i>

40:00.735 --> 40:03.271
Ask her what her
mother and I call her.

40:18.119 --> 40:19.153
Little Dixie.

40:21.689 --> 40:23.758
<i>Call me when it's done.</i>

40:44.679 --> 40:46.747
<i>Â¿EstÃ¡s bien, Little Dixie?</i>

40:48.916 --> 40:51.585
Hey, you like music?

40:52.653 --> 40:54.055
Yeah, I got something for you.

41:10.604 --> 41:13.107
See it?
Yeah, yeah, no it's labeled.

41:13.841 --> 41:16.277
Well, no, we had
two different labels this year.

41:16.476 --> 41:19.513
I put, um, one gold
for you and then one red.

41:19.580 --> 41:21.615
So it was distinctly different.

41:22.049 --> 41:24.218
Yeah, sorry about that,
I was in a rush.

41:25.453 --> 41:27.154
Yeah, no, okay, things are good.

41:28.089 --> 41:29.824
She's good, she's good.

41:30.358 --> 41:32.226
No, well we've got midterms

41:32.994 --> 41:36.063
and we're just not quite sure
where the situation is at

41:36.130 --> 41:38.032
with timing and scheduling,
but things are well.

41:38.099 --> 41:39.133
How about you guys?

41:41.602 --> 41:45.239
Um, Stace,
I gotta call you back.

41:48.309 --> 41:49.377
What the fuck
are you doing here?

41:49.710 --> 41:52.213
I had the cops at my door
earlier, asking about you.

41:52.780 --> 41:55.583
What'd you do, Doc?
Someone took her.

41:57.985 --> 41:58.986
Nell?

42:00.287 --> 42:02.590
What the fuck are you saying?
Shh, I need you to be quiet.

42:02.690 --> 42:04.158
Who the fuck took her?

42:04.225 --> 42:05.593
I don't know.
Where?

42:05.793 --> 42:07.528
Come, I need to talk to you,
she'll be okay.

42:07.661 --> 42:09.163
How did you--

42:10.698 --> 42:12.333
I don't care
what you have to do,

42:12.433 --> 42:14.135
you get her back.
Do you understand?

42:15.369 --> 42:16.437
And you do it for her, Doc.

42:16.737 --> 42:18.973
Because once she's home,
you will never see her again.

42:19.106 --> 42:20.307
I will make sure of it.

42:20.374 --> 42:21.675
Yeah.

42:21.742 --> 42:24.145
If they hurt her,
I'll kill you myself.

42:24.578 --> 42:26.881
Like, I thought
passing out drunk,

42:27.148 --> 42:30.584
letting our six-year-old girl
wander into the streets was bad?

42:31.619 --> 42:33.522
I hate you.

42:35.623 --> 42:37.058
Do you hear me?

42:37.491 --> 42:39.160
I fucking hate you.

42:40.995 --> 42:42.063
Where's Andy?

42:43.130 --> 42:44.231
He's at work.

42:46.300 --> 42:48.002
You can't tell him anything.

42:48.102 --> 42:50.037
He's my husband,
he's not gonna know?

42:51.972 --> 42:54.942
All right, fine. But he--
he can't say a word.

42:55.676 --> 42:58.012
Who's he gonna tell, Doc?
Nobody.

42:58.245 --> 43:00.948
- Do you understand me, Carla?
- Yes. Yes.

43:01.582 --> 43:02.983
What are you waiting for?

43:06.187 --> 43:07.922
âª <i>But I kept on looking</i>
<i>For a sign</i> âª

43:07.988 --> 43:12.259
âª <i>In the middle of the night</i>
<i>But I couldn't see the light</i> âª

43:12.359 --> 43:14.628
âª <i>No, I couldn't see the light</i> âª

43:17.465 --> 43:19.400
âª <i>To take me through the night</i> âª

43:19.900 --> 43:24.138
âª <i>I couldn't get it right</i>
<i>I couldn't get it right</i> âª

43:37.651 --> 43:40.654
All right, give me a minute!

43:45.993 --> 43:46.994
<i>Voila.</i>

43:48.262 --> 43:50.364
You got the Glocks.
You got the Beretta.

43:50.798 --> 43:53.501
You got the Birds,
the semi-autos.

43:53.734 --> 43:56.170
And of course, the trimmings.

43:56.770 --> 43:58.873
I need a Glock 19
with four extra mags.

43:59.340 --> 44:00.509
Money.

44:00.841 --> 44:02.243
Beretta
with the extended mag.

44:02.643 --> 44:04.111
Pussy.

44:05.112 --> 44:07.948
Give me ten boxes of VOR-TX's
for the Glock and the Beretta

44:08.015 --> 44:10.117
and throw in a Ka-Bar
with a strap.

44:11.018 --> 44:12.786
You've got it, man.

44:16.223 --> 44:19.860
What else?
Want some dessert?

44:20.995 --> 44:21.996
Suppressors.

44:22.730 --> 44:23.931
Suppressors.

44:29.703 --> 44:31.138
That it?

44:32.806 --> 44:34.008
I need something...

44:35.209 --> 44:36.210
sharp.

44:37.546 --> 44:38.746
Sharp?

44:39.680 --> 44:41.182
I mean, you got
the Ka-Bar right there, man.

44:41.248 --> 44:43.751
No, no, I mean
something that could...

44:45.019 --> 44:46.053
Oh.

44:48.155 --> 44:49.190
Oh.

44:50.424 --> 44:51.425
Yeah.

44:52.226 --> 44:55.362
I got a chainsaw in my truck,
how about that for sharp?

44:58.032 --> 44:59.333
Yeah.
Yeah?

45:00.367 --> 45:03.771
Shit yeah.

45:04.171 --> 45:08.776
I'll go get it.

45:42.943 --> 45:44.278
Hey, Karl, open up.

45:47.948 --> 45:51.218
Don't make me bust this door in,
Karl, open the door.

45:53.821 --> 45:57.491
Karl.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.861
Doc, is that you?

46:01.061 --> 46:03.764
No, man, it's the Easter bunny.
Open the fucking door.

46:05.032 --> 46:06.066
Listen,
if you wouldn't mind,

46:06.166 --> 46:07.702
I'd rather just talk
through the door.

46:07.968 --> 46:09.537
No, that's not
gonna work, Karl.

46:11.171 --> 46:12.172
You alone?

46:13.140 --> 46:15.876
Open the door.
No, are you alone?

46:16.343 --> 46:17.344
I'm alone.

46:21.982 --> 46:23.884
- How's it going?
- Not well.

46:26.954 --> 46:28.155
What do you want?

46:30.725 --> 46:31.792
What you got there?

46:31.925 --> 46:33.060
It's my father's, okay.

46:33.260 --> 46:35.095
And it's like... it's like,
fucking you know, like,

46:35.664 --> 46:37.532
Mad Max,
road warrior shit out there.

46:37.599 --> 46:38.600
Give me the gun.

46:39.066 --> 46:39.900
No, I'm not giving
you give my gun.
Give me the gun.

46:39.900 --> 46:41.201
I'll hold my fucking gun.

46:42.269 --> 46:43.270
What do you want?

46:47.074 --> 46:49.009
Come on.
I want it back.

46:52.747 --> 46:55.416
What... what are you fucking
hitting me for?

46:55.617 --> 46:58.285
Point a fucking gun at me?
I didn't point a gun at you.

46:58.352 --> 47:00.354
Give my fucking piece back.
The fuck is wrong with you?

47:01.288 --> 47:03.223
You shouldn't put
your fucking hands on me.

47:04.024 --> 47:05.826
What the fuck's going on, Karl?

47:08.162 --> 47:09.597
Man, what the fuck do I know?

47:09.798 --> 47:11.432
Okay, I don't know shit.
They got my daughter.

47:15.836 --> 47:17.304
Christ, I'm sorry, okay.

47:17.371 --> 47:19.507
This blew up
in everybody's fucking face.

47:21.842 --> 47:24.478
Doc, this ain't some grand
fucking conspiracy, okay.

47:24.546 --> 47:25.613
I wish it were.

47:26.380 --> 47:28.750
But Billie, she made
some sort of deal

47:28.849 --> 47:30.250
with the Predos, the Prados

47:30.317 --> 47:31.885
whatever the fuck
their name is.

47:31.952 --> 47:33.454
And she didn't tell Rich.

47:33.755 --> 47:35.489
And then Rich sees
an opportunity

47:35.824 --> 47:38.058
to become the big
motherfucking hero.

47:38.492 --> 47:40.394
All right, it's that simple.

47:40.762 --> 47:42.196
Right hand don't know
what the left hand

47:42.296 --> 47:44.498
or whatever the fuck's
going on, and that's it.

47:44.566 --> 47:46.100
That's it?
That's it!

47:47.736 --> 47:49.203
What about the warehouse raid,
Karl?

47:49.269 --> 47:52.039
Oh, for God's sake,
man, are you serious?
Yeah.

47:53.140 --> 47:56.377
That's got fucking Billie's name
all the fuck over it, man.

47:56.678 --> 47:59.079
The fucking press
conference and all?

47:59.913 --> 48:02.851
They needed something big

48:03.350 --> 48:08.556
to deflect
from the oil scandal, okay?

48:08.790 --> 48:11.091
And it came up
and bit her on her ass.

48:11.659 --> 48:13.227
And you didn't know about this?

48:13.894 --> 48:15.730
Oh, come on.
I mean you-- Seriously?

48:16.096 --> 48:17.866
What, they played you
like they played me?

48:17.931 --> 48:19.366
Give me a fucking break.

48:26.775 --> 48:27.908
Where's Rich now?

48:28.475 --> 48:31.078
He's at the mansion.
He took his family out.

48:31.145 --> 48:32.580
But he's all in, bro.

48:33.247 --> 48:35.015
Hey, you see
the last press conference?

48:35.382 --> 48:36.885
Yeah.
Okay.

48:37.384 --> 48:39.153
Now he's gonna take
on the Cartel,

48:39.253 --> 48:41.488
like the big man
that he thinks he is.

48:42.456 --> 48:45.259
It's fucking simple, Doc.
Who's Cuco?

48:48.863 --> 48:50.565
That's who's doing this?
Yeah.

48:54.168 --> 48:57.471
He's, um, Lalo's half-brother.
Okay, he's the one

48:57.539 --> 48:59.674
that everybody forgets
to mention. He's...

49:00.974 --> 49:02.242
he's the one
with the most to prove

49:02.309 --> 49:04.311
because he's a fucking American.

49:05.513 --> 49:06.514
Real name's Raffe.

49:07.948 --> 49:11.920
But, down in the Sandbox,
he's known as Cuco,

49:11.985 --> 49:16.056
and that means, loosely
translated, boogieman.

49:17.826 --> 49:18.927
All the mass graves down there

49:18.992 --> 49:20.562
and the kidnappings,
and the bombings,

49:20.628 --> 49:23.297
and all the murders
and shit, that's him, bro.

49:26.133 --> 49:28.536
I met him once with Billie.
That is him.

49:29.571 --> 49:31.906
When we were down
in the compound, Zaragoza.

49:31.972 --> 49:33.440
Now, if he's got your kid,

49:34.709 --> 49:37.612
I really am sorry, I really am,

49:38.045 --> 49:40.447
but that's got nothing
to fucking do with me.

49:40.748 --> 49:41.883
Zaragoza?

49:42.149 --> 49:44.251
It's a fucking fortress,

49:44.318 --> 49:45.954
like you see
in the fucking movies,

49:46.019 --> 49:47.087
all right?

49:47.354 --> 49:50.224
And then villages
all built up around it.

49:50.625 --> 49:52.159
Jesus Christ, man.

49:53.360 --> 49:56.564
What do they want? What, Jeffs?

49:58.733 --> 50:00.200
They want his head.

50:00.668 --> 50:02.302
- What?
- His head.

50:03.036 --> 50:04.238
Literally?

50:05.940 --> 50:09.076
This is a nightmare to me.

50:09.142 --> 50:10.612
So what are you gonna do?

50:14.883 --> 50:17.017
Anything I have to.
Then what?

50:30.030 --> 50:31.365
I'm sorry about that Karl.

50:46.079 --> 50:48.950
Let's give it up
for the fiercest queen,

50:49.149 --> 50:52.020
you've ever seen, Misty.

50:55.690 --> 51:02.062
<i>âª There's a change in pace</i>
<i>Of fantasy and taste âª</i>

51:04.933 --> 51:07.936

And if you got that itch,

52:36.824 --> 52:39.627
come to the bar
and come pick out your song.

52:39.827 --> 52:44.799
We got drag queen karaoke
all night long.

53:12.026 --> 53:14.461
My mother had a dress like that.

53:16.064 --> 53:17.264
It's pretty.

53:23.171 --> 53:24.839
I like the way you sing.

53:28.408 --> 53:29.744
Thank you, sweetie.

53:30.945 --> 53:33.413
What's your name?
Cuco.

53:34.515 --> 53:36.884
I like those sunglasses, Cuco.

53:43.057 --> 53:44.892
Well,
how about I buy you a drink?

54:02.643 --> 54:05.913
Well,
look who brought Mr. 45.

54:07.380 --> 54:08.850
I like a bad guy.

54:10.450 --> 54:12.419
I need to use
a little girl's room.

54:13.253 --> 54:14.454
It's out of order.

54:17.825 --> 54:20.494
Okay, I was just gonna
get cleaned up for you.

54:23.131 --> 54:25.867
Get on the fucking bed.
Oh, yeah.

54:26.366 --> 54:27.735
And face down.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.877
Rip me open, bad boy.

55:11.478 --> 55:13.380
Listen, honey, we knew
it was gonna get worse

55:13.446 --> 55:14.682
before it got better.

55:18.119 --> 55:20.387
I'm fine. I promise.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.528
Let them know
if you need anything, yeah?

55:29.797 --> 55:31.398
I love you, too.

55:32.900 --> 55:34.602
Mm-hmm. Bye.

55:45.345 --> 55:46.614
He was a good kid.

55:50.151 --> 55:51.719
I can't believe he's gone.

55:53.254 --> 55:54.255
Come here.

55:54.655 --> 55:58.092
We are safe now.

56:02.495 --> 56:04.131
Everything is gonna be fine.

57:34.655 --> 57:35.856
Hey.

57:51.772 --> 57:55.609
Are you hungry?

57:55.843 --> 57:57.678
I can order you something
to eat.

57:58.779 --> 58:01.549
Yeah, no, I don't think
I'll eat for a week.

58:03.284 --> 58:04.952
You gotta eat, babe.

58:05.686 --> 58:08.556
Hey, did you, um,
contact his family yet?

58:09.757 --> 58:11.926
No, it slipped my mind.

58:12.492 --> 58:14.729
I'm gonna call him
in the morning.

58:21.869 --> 58:24.271
We are gonna have
a busy day tomorrow,

58:24.338 --> 58:26.040
once this thing goes national.

58:27.274 --> 58:30.311
Have you, uh,
drafted anything yet?

58:30.378 --> 58:32.546
Any early thoughts, ideas?

58:34.081 --> 58:36.250
Oh, my fucking God, Doc.

58:37.385 --> 58:38.586
What the fuck?

58:39.253 --> 58:40.254
Sit down, Rich.

58:45.926 --> 58:47.628
God damn it, Doc.

58:49.030 --> 58:50.131
What do you want?

58:53.067 --> 58:53.901
You don't want to know.

58:54.235 --> 58:58.372
Listen, I'm sorry about Billie,
I know how close you were.

58:58.706 --> 59:00.541
But she was fucking using you.

59:01.042 --> 59:02.777
It was her idea
to raid the warehouse.

59:02.977 --> 59:04.945
Her idea to take
on the Cartel.

59:05.012 --> 59:06.080
They got Nell.

59:08.582 --> 59:09.750
Oh, my God.

59:10.184 --> 59:12.620
Please let me help, I can help.
Too late.

59:14.188 --> 59:17.892
Wait, they're not gonna hurt
Deb and Taylor, are they?

59:21.295 --> 59:23.564
Are you?
No.

59:25.299 --> 59:26.734
I won't.

59:28.002 --> 59:29.036
Come on, Doc.

59:32.807 --> 59:34.775
Oh, fuck, God help me.

59:46.587 --> 59:48.989
You know what I thought
about the other day?

59:51.025 --> 59:56.263
That 4th of July
at the lake, Billie's house.

59:58.365 --> 01:00:00.234
You and Carla were
together I think.

01:00:00.334 --> 01:00:01.469
Yeah.

01:00:02.136 --> 01:00:03.671
It was right before
my last tour.

01:00:03.871 --> 01:00:07.007
Yeah.
Kids must have been six, seven.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.580
And they wanted
to get married

01:00:11.679 --> 01:00:12.913
under the fireworks.

01:00:15.649 --> 01:00:17.318
We had a wedding
for them on the dock.

01:00:18.619 --> 01:00:21.288
Riggs was the priest.

01:00:21.655 --> 01:00:22.823
I was Taylor's best man.

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:24.593
And you walked Nell
down the aisle.

01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:32.099
This is all my fault.

01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:41.375
You know, you were like
a brother to me.

01:00:43.444 --> 01:00:44.645
I know.

01:00:46.548 --> 01:00:47.982
I'm sorry, Doc.

01:00:50.351 --> 01:00:51.719
I'm so sorry.

01:02:51.805 --> 01:02:53.040
Yeah.

01:02:53.841 --> 01:02:55.843
<i>It's done.</i>

01:02:56.777 --> 01:02:58.279
Oh, that's good.

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.585
<i>Where do you want me</i>
<i>to meet you?</i>

01:03:10.257 --> 01:03:11.358
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:28.242 --> 01:03:30.044
It sounds like
you're at a party.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.815
Let me talk to Nell.

01:03:35.717 --> 01:03:37.251
<i>I can't</i>
<i>do that right now.</i>

01:03:37.318 --> 01:03:39.420
I want to talk
to my daughter.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.122
<i>Yo, relax. She's fine.</i>

01:03:43.924 --> 01:03:45.159
<i>I promise.</i>

01:03:47.428 --> 01:03:51.365
There's a little town
near the border, called Del Rio.

01:03:52.433 --> 01:03:54.134
Do you know it?

01:03:55.202 --> 01:03:57.037
Yeah, East of El Paso.

01:03:58.072 --> 01:03:59.340
<i>That's the one.</i>

01:04:00.007 --> 01:04:03.344
<i>There's a motel there,</i>
<i>The Royal Inn,</i>

01:04:03.944 --> 01:04:05.379
<i>come meet me there</i>
<i>tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.</i>

01:04:05.446 --> 01:04:07.281
Cuco, you lay
your finger on my kid,

01:04:07.348 --> 01:04:08.849
I swear to God I'll kill you.

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:11.919
Hello?

01:04:23.364 --> 01:04:24.932
What the fuck?

01:04:31.071 --> 01:04:32.707
What is this, hun?

01:04:33.006 --> 01:04:35.309
I don't do whatever this is.

01:04:36.511 --> 01:04:37.712
Then why did you do that?

01:04:38.145 --> 01:04:42.282
I just wanted to fix
my makeup and there she is.

01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:43.384
But I said...

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:45.687
I said to you, do not--

01:04:45.754 --> 01:04:47.655
What the fuck is going on, hun?

01:04:48.355 --> 01:04:50.491
Honey, you--

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:56.664
No. No!

01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:07.307
Don't hurt me, Cuco.
Don't hurt me, Cuco.

01:05:07.842 --> 01:05:11.646
Cuco.

01:05:12.446 --> 01:05:14.381
Shh, shh.

01:06:10.805 --> 01:06:12.072
Fuck.

01:07:34.421 --> 01:07:37.491
It's gonna be a long night.

01:08:02.951 --> 01:08:04.619
Someone had
too much to drink.

01:08:06.688 --> 01:08:08.121
You have a good night.

01:08:14.328 --> 01:08:16.531
Oh, you fucking bitch.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.689
Fuck.

01:08:46.828 --> 01:08:47.895
God damn it, Rich.

01:09:23.064 --> 01:09:24.064
Hey.

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:27.769
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>
I'm about to go get her.

01:09:28.234 --> 01:09:29.469
<i>Where is she?</i>

01:09:30.437 --> 01:09:31.939
I can't tell you that, Carla.

01:09:34.908 --> 01:09:36.644
<i>Did you hear</i>
<i>what happened to Richard?</i>

01:09:39.179 --> 01:09:40.948
Yeah. I heard.

01:09:41.816 --> 01:09:43.417
<i>There was a girl</i>
<i>in there with him,</i>

01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:46.854
<i>his press secretary, I think,</i>
<i>it's all over the news.</i>

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:48.287
<i>Deb is hysterical.</i>

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:50.223
<i>But they won't tell her</i>
<i>anything else.</i>

01:09:53.027 --> 01:09:55.863
<i>What's happening, Doc?</i>
<i>Are you guys gonna be okay?</i>

01:09:57.799 --> 01:09:59.534
Nell's a tough kid, Carla.

01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:02.704
<i>I know.</i>

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:05.405
She's gonna be fine, sweetheart.

01:10:06.273 --> 01:10:10.511
<i>Doc, listen,</i>
<i>I'm sorry about what I said.</i>

01:10:11.079 --> 01:10:13.280
<i>I am still so angry with you</i>

01:10:13.346 --> 01:10:16.050
<i>and it drives me crazy</i>
<i>that no matter what,</i>

01:10:16.316 --> 01:10:18.285
<i>she'll always love you more.</i>

01:10:20.253 --> 01:10:21.656
<i>You're her idol, Doc.</i>

01:10:24.257 --> 01:10:26.426
<i>She also knows</i>
<i>what you're capable of.</i>

01:10:27.128 --> 01:10:28.529
<i>So wherever she is...</i>

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.702
<i>I'm sure she knows</i>
<i>you're coming.</i>

01:10:36.104 --> 01:10:37.304
Look, I gotta go.

01:10:38.438 --> 01:10:40.608
I'll call you
as soon as I have her, okay?

01:10:44.045 --> 01:10:45.913
<i>Doc?</i>
Yeah.

01:10:47.548 --> 01:10:50.651
<i>Please be careful.</i>
I always am.

01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:10.497
Your papa's coming.

01:12:13.433 --> 01:12:15.736
- I know.
- You know?

01:12:20.541 --> 01:12:23.811
Your papa is a bad man.

01:12:25.179 --> 01:12:30.918
That's why you don't scare me.

01:12:31.786 --> 01:12:34.622
No? Mmm.

01:12:35.455 --> 01:12:37.625
Most little girls
get really scared.

01:12:40.393 --> 01:12:42.663
Not you, huh?

01:12:45.766 --> 01:12:47.902
You shouldn't have killed
that lady.

01:13:00.081 --> 01:13:01.782
But she didn't listen.

01:13:03.483 --> 01:13:04.986
She didn't listen to me.

01:13:07.321 --> 01:13:08.789
How can you do that?

01:13:18.566 --> 01:13:20.801
When was the first time
you killed someone?

01:13:23.436 --> 01:13:24.805
When I was a boy.

01:13:27.008 --> 01:13:28.009
Younger than you.

01:13:34.382 --> 01:13:35.683
What happened?

01:13:40.187 --> 01:13:41.622
I was a bastard.

01:13:44.058 --> 01:13:45.760
My mother was an American...

01:13:47.628 --> 01:13:52.066
but she was also a lady
of the night, you could say.

01:13:54.969 --> 01:13:57.672
My skin was lighter
than all of my brothers,

01:13:59.472 --> 01:14:02.677
so no one believed
I was a son of Antonio Prado.

01:14:06.479 --> 01:14:09.517
And my mother
was a very beautiful woman.

01:14:12.386 --> 01:14:13.721
Beautiful.

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:18.025
She died when I was 13.

01:14:19.527 --> 01:14:21.662
And my father,
he always made sure

01:14:21.729 --> 01:14:23.097
I was taken care of.

01:14:24.464 --> 01:14:27.134
But his wife
never accepted me.

01:14:28.402 --> 01:14:30.705
There was one boy in town...

01:14:32.907 --> 01:14:36.944
he called my mother a whore,
the day after her funeral.

01:14:40.081 --> 01:14:43.884
So I followed him home
that day and waited.

01:14:48.488 --> 01:14:53.194
That night I snuck into his room
and cut his throat.

01:14:57.131 --> 01:14:58.799
What happened after that?

01:15:04.405 --> 01:15:06.907
No one ever talked
about my mother again.

01:15:13.247 --> 01:15:14.615
And what about your dad?

01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.918
We became very close.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.822
And he knew
what you did to that boy?

01:15:22.857 --> 01:15:25.893
My father knew everything
that happened in his town.

01:15:29.163 --> 01:15:30.765
So you like it?

01:15:35.503 --> 01:15:36.871
I'm a good at it.

01:15:47.516 --> 01:15:49.550
Are you sick
to your stomach now?

01:15:51.352 --> 01:15:52.920
I thought I didn't scare you.

01:15:54.822 --> 01:15:56.957
I don't like burgers
without ketchup.

01:16:02.696 --> 01:16:06.967
The girl wants ketchup.

01:16:15.276 --> 01:16:17.878
Right there. That's where
I saw him coming out of.

01:16:27.988 --> 01:16:29.924
It was a big girl,
I mean, you saw him, right?

01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:31.258
He was coming out
of that room right there.

01:16:33.562 --> 01:16:35.296
Fuck. Fuck.

01:16:47.174 --> 01:16:48.709
Listen, you little bitch.

01:16:49.743 --> 01:16:50.744
Now, you say a word,

01:16:50.878 --> 01:16:53.013
I'm gonna shoot you
in the fucking face.

01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:55.850
We're gonna go on a little ride.

01:16:57.552 --> 01:16:59.186
Have you ever been to Mexico?

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.695
Get in the fucking trunk.

01:17:07.761 --> 01:17:10.164
Hey, man, hold on.
Call the fucking cops.

01:17:10.297 --> 01:17:13.400
Stop. Stop it.
Hey, what are doing, bud?

01:17:13.767 --> 01:17:15.803
Who is this?
He's not hurting you?

01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:17.338
Are you okay?
What's going on?

01:17:17.572 --> 01:17:20.641
What the fuck.

01:17:30.718 --> 01:17:35.089
- Don't take another fucking step.
- Turn around.

01:17:38.025 --> 01:17:39.026
Turn around!

01:17:41.896 --> 01:17:43.697
You think I'm fucking around?

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:47.701
Get your ass
in the fucking trunk.

01:18:02.449 --> 01:18:04.218
Oh, you fucked up, fool.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.814
I don't know
what's going on.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.782
I need you
to send somebody over.

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:11.418
The Royal Motel.

01:19:15.624 --> 01:19:17.958
Hold on, man. No please.

01:19:53.728 --> 01:19:54.729
What the fuck
were you thinking

01:19:54.795 --> 01:19:55.996
with that girl?

01:19:57.431 --> 01:20:02.136
I mean, she knew
about your wife and your kid.

01:20:06.675 --> 01:20:08.475
I didn't wanna fucking do her.

01:20:10.578 --> 01:20:12.079
No fucking choice.

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:18.352
You fucking had everything.

01:20:19.654 --> 01:20:20.854
You fucking did.

01:20:23.223 --> 01:20:24.224
Golden boy.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.960
Now look at you.

01:20:31.832 --> 01:20:34.301
Fucking head in a bag, great.

01:20:37.037 --> 01:20:40.140
You know, I hadn't thought
about that lake trip in years.

01:20:40.341 --> 01:20:41.475
I forgot about it.

01:20:41.875 --> 01:20:43.545
And the kids...

01:20:45.913 --> 01:20:50.084
married under the fireworks.
God, that was a fucking--

01:20:50.851 --> 01:20:53.220
God damn it,
that was a great weekend.

01:20:55.824 --> 01:20:57.391
You know, I think
that was the last time

01:20:57.525 --> 01:21:01.862
that Carla and I were in love.

01:21:04.064 --> 01:21:05.800
It was when I came back
from that last tour,

01:21:05.866 --> 01:21:07.067
you remember?

01:21:09.303 --> 01:21:11.872
It was fucked up, man,
I couldn't handle it.

01:21:13.508 --> 01:21:15.342
Something changed inside of me.

01:21:16.243 --> 01:21:17.244
You remember.

01:21:18.112 --> 01:21:20.013
I couldn't deal with anything.

01:21:22.383 --> 01:21:26.220
And then the whole
husband and daddy thing,

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:29.123
I mean, fuck me.

01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:32.493
Everybody was so fucking normal.

01:21:38.265 --> 01:21:40.367
I just saw some fucked up shit.

01:21:42.637 --> 01:21:45.339
You were running for office.

01:21:50.043 --> 01:21:51.445
And then the divorce, man.

01:21:51.513 --> 01:21:56.116
And you know, somehow
I was the pariah.

01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:59.153
You know,
nobody wanted to fucking deal

01:21:59.219 --> 01:22:00.921
with the basket case.

01:22:11.965 --> 01:22:13.500
Man, you were like my brother.

01:22:16.905 --> 01:22:18.238
Now look at this shit.

01:22:19.973 --> 01:22:21.275
Doesn't make sense.

01:22:27.916 --> 01:22:29.249
It's nice to talk.

01:23:03.283 --> 01:23:05.085
Fuck.

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:32.012
Come on, you motherfucker.

01:24:37.912 --> 01:24:39.179
Can I help you?

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:44.084
What happened here?
Back to your room, now.

01:24:53.628 --> 01:24:56.129
- Hey, you live here?
- Yeah, you could say that.

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:57.632
What happened?

01:24:58.198 --> 01:25:00.233
I hear some potato
murked them fools, man.

01:25:00.702 --> 01:25:03.370
- Had a girl with him too.
- Is she alive?

01:25:03.805 --> 01:25:05.305
She was walking.

01:25:06.975 --> 01:25:08.175
Then what happened?

01:25:08.241 --> 01:25:10.578
They got in their whip
and they went that way, dude.

01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:12.547
What way's that?
Was it that way?

01:25:12.614 --> 01:25:15.449
Right, that way.
What's that way?

01:25:15.516 --> 01:25:17.819
The fucking sandbox,
homie. Mexico.

01:25:18.151 --> 01:25:21.388
Mexico. Thanks man.

01:25:26.928 --> 01:25:30.832
Going to Mexico.

01:25:46.814 --> 01:25:48.616
Fuck you, bitch.

01:29:23.496 --> 01:29:24.765
Where's my daughter?

01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:28.970
She's fine.

01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:31.906
Why don't you go get her.

01:29:32.874 --> 01:29:34.041
We'll be on our way.

01:29:34.876 --> 01:29:39.113
I'm sorry, but the deal
you made with my brother...

01:29:42.516 --> 01:29:45.553
I cannot honor it.
I didn't make a deal...

01:29:46.486 --> 01:29:47.688
with your brother.

01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:50.858
He snatched my kid.

01:29:55.263 --> 01:29:56.496
Look...

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:01.636
Doc...

01:30:03.004 --> 01:30:05.873
I know you were there
when they executed Miguel.

01:30:07.808 --> 01:30:09.944
I'm grateful for that, truly.

01:30:11.746 --> 01:30:13.781
I've heard nothing
but good things

01:30:13.881 --> 01:30:17.417
about you from him
and the people who work for me.

01:30:18.319 --> 01:30:19.520
However...

01:30:21.956 --> 01:30:22.957
my brother here...

01:30:24.424 --> 01:30:25.626
who took your daughter...

01:30:27.427 --> 01:30:29.864
has caused a bit
of a problem for me.

01:30:31.299 --> 01:30:32.566
I guess...

01:30:34.635 --> 01:30:36.003
he had you help him?

01:30:40.308 --> 01:30:43.476
I cannot have any of this...

01:30:44.779 --> 01:30:48.015
leading back to me
or my business.

01:30:52.053 --> 01:30:53.120
I'm sorry.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.761
What about my kid, man?

01:31:12.173 --> 01:31:13.174
Pacho.

01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:25.052
Sit the fuck down.

01:31:27.822 --> 01:31:31.192
It's okay, baby, it's okay.

01:31:32.193 --> 01:31:33.227
Just be still.

01:31:38.399 --> 01:31:40.568
Let's go
for a little walk.

01:31:50.277 --> 01:31:52.713
It's okay baby, it's okay.

01:31:58.486 --> 01:32:00.621
You remember
when you were a little girl...

01:32:01.689 --> 01:32:02.890
and the storms would come,

01:32:02.957 --> 01:32:06.093
and I'd tell you
how to hide, you remember that?

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.995
Shut the fuck up.

01:32:10.264 --> 01:32:11.999
Let's do it right fucking here.

01:32:42.296 --> 01:32:44.899
I'm sorry
it had to happen this way.

01:32:48.269 --> 01:32:49.770
Little Dixie.

01:32:55.676 --> 01:32:58.045
Oh, I'm gonna fucking miss you.

01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:05.352
Shh.

01:33:10.324 --> 01:33:12.626
Now get on your fucking knees.

01:33:20.501 --> 01:33:21.869
Pacho.

01:33:27.708 --> 01:33:30.177
I thought
you were a bad motherfucker.

01:33:32.379 --> 01:33:35.349
Just some old man.

01:33:37.952 --> 01:33:40.754
Pacho, sit him up, sit him up.

01:34:13.622 --> 01:34:15.322
Okay, it's okay, baby.

01:34:16.857 --> 01:34:19.360
Come with me. Come on.

01:34:24.265 --> 01:34:26.367
Shh. Shh.

01:34:54.461 --> 01:34:55.664
Shh.

01:35:08.909 --> 01:35:12.313
You stay close to me.
You stay close.

01:35:58.492 --> 01:36:00.261
Come on.

01:36:00.327 --> 01:36:01.495
Shh.

01:36:03.364 --> 01:36:04.431
Take this. Take this.

01:36:05.099 --> 01:36:09.069
Look at me,
you use it if you have to. Okay?

01:36:11.405 --> 01:36:12.973
Shh, stay here.

01:37:05.859 --> 01:37:08.095
That you were gonna come
into my country...

01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:11.533
that you were gonna
come into my house...

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.501
and make me look like a fool?

01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:17.271
Where's my brother?

01:37:19.674 --> 01:37:21.008
In the field.

01:37:39.561 --> 01:37:40.595
Okay.

01:38:28.576 --> 01:38:30.077
How you feeling, kiddo?

01:38:30.712 --> 01:38:31.979
I'm okay.

01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:34.516
Yeah?

01:38:40.921 --> 01:38:43.957
Do you know
where I wanted to go on my trip?

01:38:44.458 --> 01:38:45.492
Where?

01:38:46.761 --> 01:38:49.930
Mexico.

01:38:49.997 --> 01:38:54.101
No more Mexico.

01:38:56.036 --> 01:38:59.607
We'll go somewhere else
next time.
Yeah.

01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:04.411
You have
your mother's sense of humor.

01:39:06.413 --> 01:39:07.414
I called her...

01:39:08.482 --> 01:39:09.517
told her you're okay.

01:39:14.522 --> 01:39:15.590
I love you, Dad.

01:39:16.658 --> 01:39:17.725
I missed you.

01:39:19.126 --> 01:39:20.595
I love you too, baby.

01:39:46.721 --> 01:39:47.722
What are we doing?

01:39:49.858 --> 01:39:51.492
I need to make one last stop.

01:40:11.679 --> 01:40:13.146
There you go, pal.

01:40:14.916 --> 01:40:16.518
It's the best I could do.
