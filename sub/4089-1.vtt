11:26.491 --> 11:29.461
Watch this shot now! Shoot, man! Go!

12:11.786 --> 12:12.912
Yeah!

14:10.322 --> 14:13.701
- Chickie! Chick, chick, chick!
- Boy! Jet boy!

14:14.117 --> 14:15.369
Jet boy!

14:26.254 --> 14:27.722
Jet, Jet, Jets!

14:29.090 --> 14:30.808
- Come back!
- Come over here!

14:30.884 --> 14:31.885
Chickens!

14:46.066 --> 14:47.409
Beat it!

14:58.578 --> 14:59.921
Yeah!

15:02.916 --> 15:04.714
All right, go, Jets!

15:09.547 --> 15:10.764
Snowboy!

15:21.101 --> 15:22.398
Come on!

15:31.069 --> 15:32.286
Beat it!

15:41.746 --> 15:44.249
Chico! Andale, chico!

15:45.208 --> 15:46.630
Okay, here we go!

15:47.502 --> 15:49.379
Over here, A-Rab!

16:22.328 --> 16:24.251
Jets! Jets!

16:29.669 --> 16:32.513
Bernardo! Indio! Chaco, come on!

16:38.511 --> 16:40.684
Jets, come on! Follow me, baby.

16:53.610 --> 16:56.079
- Mira, mira, mira!
- Jets!

17:03.787 --> 17:05.334
Andale, Chico!

17:06.580 --> 17:08.174
Come on, Jets!

17:08.916 --> 17:10.260
Hey, Jets!

17:11.044 --> 17:12.215
Hello!

17:15.882 --> 17:17.555
Jets, come on! Julio!

17:18.009 --> 17:19.477
Come on!

17:22.137 --> 17:23.685
Jets!

17:28.560 --> 17:30.188
Come on, boys!

17:31.564 --> 17:33.032
Come on, now!

18:19.529 --> 18:20.781
Jets!

18:55.356 --> 18:59.577
Break it up, you punks! Cut it out!
Come on, guys! Break it up, I said!

18:59.652 --> 19:01.905
Come on, break it up! Come on!

19:01.988 --> 19:04.832
How many times have I told you
punks to cut this stuff out?

19:04.908 --> 19:09.004
- Why, if it ain't Lt. Schrank!
- Top of the day, Lt. Schrank.

19:09.078 --> 19:12.582
- And Officer Krupke.
- Top of the day, Officer Krupke.

19:12.665 --> 19:15.509
- I'll give you the top of the head.
- Hey you, get down!

19:15.627 --> 19:18.506
- But we're having such fun.
- We enjoy the playground.

19:18.588 --> 19:21.512
See, it keeps us deprived children
off of the foul city streets.

19:21.591 --> 19:22.638
Shut up!

19:22.717 --> 19:24.560
And born like we was
on the hot pavement.

19:24.636 --> 19:27.435
- You wanna get your skull broke?
- Hey, Baby John, come here!

19:28.181 --> 19:29.353
Come here!

19:33.895 --> 19:35.238
All right!

19:35.355 --> 19:37.824
Now, which one of these
Puerto Ricans bloodied you?

19:39.484 --> 19:41.361
- Sir...
- Which one?

19:41.819 --> 19:43.366
Excuse me, sir.

19:43.613 --> 19:45.365
As a matter of fact...

19:45.698 --> 19:48.702
we suspicion that the
job was done by a cop.

19:49.243 --> 19:50.620
- Two cops.
- At the very least.

19:50.703 --> 19:51.670
Impossible.

19:51.746 --> 19:54.590
In America, nothing is impossible.

19:55.583 --> 19:57.381
All right, wise guys...

19:58.044 --> 19:59.637
now, you listen to me!

19:59.712 --> 20:01.055
All of you!

20:01.631 --> 20:03.725
You hoodlums don't own these streets.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.304
And I've had all the roughhouse I'm
gonna put up with around here!

20:07.387 --> 20:11.984
You wanna kill each other, kill each other!
But you ain't gonna do it on my beat!

20:12.058 --> 20:14.060
- Are there any questions?
- Yes, sir.

20:14.894 --> 20:17.397
Would you mind translating
that into Spanish?

20:19.524 --> 20:23.028
Get your friends out of here, Bernardo.

20:23.903 --> 20:25.405
And stay out!

20:30.910 --> 20:32.127
Please.

20:34.414 --> 20:35.882
Okay, Sharks.

20:37.417 --> 20:38.634
Vámonos.

20:48.094 --> 20:49.596
Boy, oh boy!

20:49.762 --> 20:52.732
As if this neighborhood
wasn't crummy enough!

20:55.101 --> 20:57.103
Now, look, fellas. Fellas!

20:57.395 --> 20:59.272
Look, let's be reasonable...

20:59.355 --> 21:01.904
if I don't get a little law
and order around here...

21:01.983 --> 21:04.577
I get busted down to
a traffic corner...

21:04.652 --> 21:07.121
and your friend don't
like traffic corners.

21:07.196 --> 21:09.164
So, that means you're gonna
start makin' nice...

21:09.240 --> 21:11.242
with the PR's from now on.

21:12.910 --> 21:14.662
I said nice! Get it?

21:15.747 --> 21:17.465
'Cause if you don't...

21:17.540 --> 21:21.465
and I catch any of you doin' any
more brawlin' in my territory...

21:21.544 --> 21:24.218
I'm gonna personally beat the livin'
crud out of each and every one of you...

21:24.297 --> 21:27.016
and see that you go to
the can and rot there!

21:30.344 --> 21:34.269
- Say good-bye to the nice boys, Krupke.
- Good-bye, boys.

21:38.811 --> 21:40.438
"Good-bye, boys."

21:41.439 --> 21:42.816
Jail? Gee.

21:43.691 --> 21:45.568
"You hoodlums don't own the streets."

21:45.651 --> 21:48.074
Go play in the park.
Keep off of the grass.

21:48.154 --> 21:50.156
- Get out of the house!
- Keep off the block.

21:50.239 --> 21:51.991
- Get outta here.
- Keep off the world!

21:52.075 --> 21:54.419
A gang that don't own
the street is nothin'!

21:54.494 --> 21:55.996
We do own it!

21:57.580 --> 21:59.457
Come on, Jets, round out!

21:59.999 --> 22:04.049
- Not you, Anybodys! Beat it!
- Riff, you gotta let me in the gang!

22:04.128 --> 22:07.803
Didn't you just see me? I was smash!
I'm a killer, I wanna fight.

22:07.882 --> 22:10.101
How else she gonna get
a guy to touch her?

22:10.176 --> 22:13.430
- You dirty rat!
- Come on, the road, little girl! The road!

22:13.554 --> 22:14.806
Beat it!

22:16.682 --> 22:18.901
- Beat it!
- Okay, come on.

22:25.483 --> 22:27.030
Okay, now listen!

22:27.110 --> 22:30.410
Now, we fought hard for this turf,
and we ain't just gonna give it up.

22:30.488 --> 22:32.411
The Emeralds claimed
it, we shot 'em out.

22:32.490 --> 22:35.494
The Hawks, remember? They tried to take
it away, we knocked them down the cellar.

22:35.576 --> 22:38.705
- But these PR's are different.
- They multiply. Like cockroaches.

22:38.788 --> 22:40.756
- Shut the door!
- They're eatin' all the food.

22:40.832 --> 22:43.460
- Breathin' all the air.
- Help! I'm drowning in tamale.

22:43.543 --> 22:46.092
And you heard what that Lt. Schrank said...

22:46.170 --> 22:49.515
we gotta make nice with
them Puerto Ricans or else.

22:49.590 --> 22:51.809
We gotta let 'em move in
right under our noses...

22:51.884 --> 22:53.978
- and take it all away from us or else.
- No!

22:54.053 --> 22:55.896
You're damn right, no!

22:56.222 --> 23:00.352
So what're we gonna do, buddy boys?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

23:00.434 --> 23:02.061
We're gonna speed back!

23:02.228 --> 23:05.607
We're gonna move like lightnin', and
we're gonna clean them Sharks up...

23:05.690 --> 23:06.907
once and for all.

23:06.983 --> 23:09.782
So they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again!

23:10.778 --> 23:14.453
We're gonna do it in one all-out fight.

23:14.574 --> 23:17.703
- A rumble! Chop, chop!
- Now cool, Action Boy.

23:17.910 --> 23:22.632
The Sharks want a piece of this world, too.
And they're real down boys.

23:23.082 --> 23:24.959
They might ask for blades...

23:25.418 --> 23:27.341
- zip guns.
- Zip guns?

23:29.255 --> 23:32.680
I ain't finalizin' and
sayin' they will, Baby John.

23:32.758 --> 23:36.979
I'm just sayin' that they might,
and we gotta be prepared.

23:38.181 --> 23:40.024
Now, what's your mood, Jets?

23:40.099 --> 23:42.773
- I say go, go!
- I say mix!

23:42.852 --> 23:44.149
- I say sock 'em!
- Tear them!

23:44.228 --> 23:48.904
- Yeah, but if they say blades or guns...
- I say let's just forget the whole thing.

23:48.983 --> 23:51.202
- What?
- What do you say, Riff?

23:52.403 --> 23:56.624
I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.954
I wanna hold it like we
always held it, with skin!

24:02.580 --> 24:05.333
But if they say blades, I say blades.

24:05.917 --> 24:08.511
If they say guns, I say guns.

24:09.378 --> 24:12.302
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!

24:12.423 --> 24:16.348
- To sail! To hold the sky!
- Then rev us off! Voom va-voom!

24:18.221 --> 24:19.393
Okay, cats, we rumble!

24:19.889 --> 24:21.141
Now...

24:21.682 --> 24:23.525
protocality calls for a war council...

24:23.601 --> 24:26.104
between us and the Sharks
to set the whole thing up.

24:26.187 --> 24:29.031
So I will personally give
the bad news to Bernardo.

24:29.106 --> 24:31.325
- You gotta take a lieutenant with you.
- That's me.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.073
- That's Tony.
- Who needs Tony?

24:33.152 --> 24:34.699
We need Tony!

24:35.029 --> 24:37.532
He's got a rep that's bigger
than the whole West Side!

24:37.615 --> 24:40.710
- He don't belong no more.
- Now, cut it, Action!

24:40.952 --> 24:44.047
- Me and Tony started the Jets.
- So where is he?

24:44.163 --> 24:47.633
- How come he takes a lousy, stinkin' job?
- Youth Board corrupted him.

24:47.708 --> 24:49.756
- Yeah, temporary sickness!
- Wait and see.

24:49.835 --> 24:52.429
Remember them fists the day
we clobbered the Emeralds?

24:52.505 --> 24:55.349
- He saved my ever-loving neck!
- Sure! He'll do it again, too!

24:55.424 --> 24:58.598
He always came through for
us and he always will.

- I read you loud and clear, Riff.

27:02.510 --> 27:05.730
- Then why don't you say somethin'?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

27:05.805 --> 27:08.900
- You're my buddy, my pal, my best friend!
- Womb to tomb?

27:10.059 --> 27:11.481
Birth to earth.

27:11.560 --> 27:15.155
That's why you gotta come to the
dance tonight and stand up with me.

27:15.439 --> 27:17.658
Come on, Tony. Just say yes.

27:17.817 --> 27:20.570
Riff, did you ever stop to figure...

27:20.653 --> 27:23.748
how many bubbles there are in one
bottle of this here soda pop?

27:23.823 --> 27:25.621
Tony, this is important!

27:25.699 --> 27:27.918
Everything's important, Riff...

27:28.160 --> 27:30.709
you, me, the sweet guy I work for.

27:31.455 --> 27:33.674
The Sharks walk bad. They bite hard.

27:33.958 --> 27:36.962
- And if we don't stop them now...
- Here! Work for a living.

27:37.753 --> 27:41.883
How do you like that? Four and a half
years I live with a buddy and his family.

27:41.966 --> 27:44.014
I think I'm diggin' a guy's character.

27:45.302 --> 27:48.146
Boy, am I a victim of
disappointment in you!

27:49.056 --> 27:51.024
End your sufferin', little man.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.694
Why don't you just pack up
your gear and move out?

27:53.769 --> 27:55.487
'Cause your ma's hot for me.

27:59.024 --> 28:02.369
No! It's 'cause I hate livin'
with my buggin' uncle!

28:02.445 --> 28:04.698
- Come on!
- Come on, uncle!

28:06.365 --> 28:07.366
Now...

28:08.075 --> 28:09.873
go play games with the Jets.

28:10.077 --> 28:12.079
And why not? They're the greatest.

28:12.538 --> 28:13.710
Ain't they?

28:14.206 --> 28:15.332
Were.

28:17.877 --> 28:19.595
You found somethin' better?

28:20.171 --> 28:22.390
No. Not yet, but...

28:23.757 --> 28:25.054
But What?

28:26.385 --> 28:28.308
You won't dig it, Riff.

28:28.804 --> 28:30.147
So try me.

28:31.182 --> 28:33.059
Come on, Tony, try me.

28:36.937 --> 28:38.029
Okay.

28:41.609 --> 28:44.909
Every single night for the
last month, I wake up...

28:45.821 --> 28:47.573
and I'm reaching out.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.453
- For what?
- I don't know.

28:52.578 --> 28:53.795
A dame?

28:54.914 --> 28:58.168
It's right outside the door,
just around the corner...

28:58.542 --> 29:00.010
but it's comin'.

29:00.085 --> 29:01.302
What is?

29:02.129 --> 29:03.597
I don't know. It...

29:05.090 --> 29:07.718
it's like the kick I used
to get from bein' a Jet.

29:07.801 --> 29:09.553
Now you're talkin'!

29:09.637 --> 29:11.981
Man, without a gang, you're an orphan.

29:12.056 --> 29:14.650
With a gang, you walk in
twos, threes, fours...

29:14.725 --> 29:16.022
and your crew is the best...

29:16.101 --> 29:18.775
when you're a Jet, you're out
in the sun, buddy boy...

29:18.854 --> 29:20.026
you're home free home!

29:20.105 --> 29:21.857
Riff, I've had it!

29:25.194 --> 29:26.411
Tony...

29:27.905 --> 29:29.282
Tony, look at me, will ya?

29:29.365 --> 29:31.367
- Come on, look at me.
- I'm lookin' at you.

29:31.450 --> 29:35.296
Now, I never asked the time
of day from a clock, did I?

29:36.372 --> 29:40.252
I never asked nothin' from
nobody, but I'm askin' you...

29:40.543 --> 29:42.170
come to the dance tonight.

29:43.462 --> 29:45.556
I promised Doc I'd clean
up the store tonight.

29:45.631 --> 29:47.633
Then do it after the dance.

29:48.467 --> 29:51.391
Tony, I already told the
guys you'd be there.

29:51.679 --> 29:54.398
If you don't show,
I'll be marked lousy.

29:55.849 --> 29:57.192
What time'd you tell 'em?

29:57.518 --> 29:58.690
10:00.

29:59.311 --> 30:01.188
For me, Tony, for Riff!

30:05.234 --> 30:07.077
- 10:00 it is.
- Womb to tomb?

30:07.152 --> 30:09.200
Birth to earth, and I'll
live to regret this.

30:09.280 --> 30:12.625
Who knows? Maybe what you're waitin'
for'll be twitchin' at the dance tonight.

30:12.700 --> 30:14.327

Por favor, Anita, you are my friend.

32:50.315 --> 32:52.943
- Stop it, Maria.
- You must make the neck lower.

32:53.026 --> 32:54.573
And you must stop heckling me.

32:54.653 --> 32:57.327
We are working on our time
now, not the old lady's.

32:57.740 --> 33:02.166
- One inch. How much can one little inch do?
- Too much.

33:02.828 --> 33:06.878
Anita, it is now to be a dress for
dancing, no longer for praying!

33:06.957 --> 33:11.178
Listen, with those boys, you can
start in dancing and end up praying.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.264
Querida, one little inch.

33:15.591 --> 33:18.515
- Bernardo made me promise!
- Bernardo!

33:18.594 --> 33:22.098
One month have I been in this country.
Do I ever even touch excitement?

33:22.181 --> 33:24.980
I sew in this place all day.
I sit at home all night.

33:25.058 --> 33:27.652
For what did my fine
brother bring me here?

33:27.728 --> 33:30.151
- To marry Chino.
- Chino.

33:30.397 --> 33:34.698
- When I look at Chino, nothing happens.
- What do you expect to happen?

33:35.027 --> 33:37.155
I don't know. Something.

33:39.490 --> 33:42.118
What happens when you look at Bernardo?

33:42.576 --> 33:45.204
It's when I don't look that it happens.

33:48.874 --> 33:53.550
I think I will tell Mama and Papa
about you and Nardo in the balcony...

33:53.629 --> 33:54.630
of the movies!

33:54.713 --> 33:57.091
- I will rip this to shreds!
- No!

33:57.549 --> 34:00.894
But if you perhaps could
manage to lower the neck...

34:01.804 --> 34:03.397
Next year.

34:04.097 --> 34:05.314
I hate that dress!

34:05.390 --> 34:08.643
Then don't wear it, and don't come
to the dance with us tonight.

34:08.726 --> 34:10.103
Don't come?

34:13.482 --> 34:17.362
- Could we not dye it red at least?
- No, we could not.

34:19.404 --> 34:21.246
White is for babies.

34:21.739 --> 34:24.835
I will be the only one
there in a white...

34:34.085 --> 34:35.463
Sí.

34:37.005 --> 34:38.973
It is a beautiful dress.

34:39.341 --> 34:40.763
I love you!

34:42.886 --> 34:45.184
- Are you ready, ladies?
- Nardo, come in.

34:45.264 --> 34:46.811
Is it not beautiful?

34:47.766 --> 34:48.983
Yes.

34:49.226 --> 34:51.945
- Very.
- I didn't quite hear.

34:52.813 --> 34:54.440
Very beautiful.

34:56.275 --> 34:58.403
Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.

34:58.652 --> 35:02.953
- But this is a shop for ladies.
- We won't bite you till we know you better.

35:03.407 --> 35:08.208
Chino, you will keep both eyes on Maria
tonight in case I cannot. You too, Anita.

35:08.287 --> 35:12.542
- My brother is a silly watchdog.
- My sister is a precious jewel.

35:14.126 --> 35:16.925
What am I? Cut glass?

35:17.838 --> 35:22.514
Nardo, it is most important that I have a
wonderful time at the dancing tonight.

35:22.593 --> 35:23.765
It is?

35:24.011 --> 35:26.764
Because tonight is the real
beginning of my life...

35:26.847 --> 35:28.975
as a young lady of America.

35:30.527 --> 35:34.527
Inserted comments without subtitles
(about 3,5 minutes)

39:32.553 --> 39:33.930
Let's go!

40:00.622 --> 40:01.874
Get outta here!

40:29.276 --> 40:31.074
Nardo. Cómo está?

40:33.447 --> 40:34.869
Chino. Chino!

40:36.408 --> 40:38.581
Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys!

40:41.163 --> 40:42.380
Maria.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.176
Look what I got.

40:46.251 --> 40:48.754
Maria, these are some of
my friends you've not met.

40:49.254 --> 40:50.756
Pick up.

40:52.132 --> 40:53.179
This is Loco.

40:53.258 --> 40:54.680
- Mucho gusto.
- Encantada.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.388
- Teresita. My sister Maria.
- Good evening.

40:57.471 --> 41:01.021
- And this is Luis and Rosa.
- Encantada. Rosalie, ai.

41:01.099 --> 41:02.442
Oye, Nardo.

41:12.110 --> 41:14.829
All right, boys and girls. All right.

41:15.989 --> 41:17.662
Attention, please!

41:20.118 --> 41:21.461
Attention!

41:23.956 --> 41:24.957
Come here.

41:25.374 --> 41:26.717
Thank you.

41:26.792 --> 41:29.762
My, this is a fine turnout
we have here tonight.

41:29.836 --> 41:32.089
It's all for you, glad hand.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.388
I know all of you boys and girls...

41:35.467 --> 41:38.095
are here because you want
to make new friends...

41:38.178 --> 41:41.057
and get closer to old ones.

41:41.139 --> 41:42.391
Yeah!

41:43.058 --> 41:47.313
So, tonight, kids, we're
gonna do something special.

41:47.771 --> 41:50.490
We're gonna have a get-together dance!

41:50.774 --> 41:51.900
Ginger! Peachy!

41:54.069 --> 41:56.242
All right, all right,
now, kids, kids...

41:56.321 --> 41:59.416
I want you to form two circles.

41:59.491 --> 42:00.538
- How many?
- Two.

42:00.617 --> 42:03.962
Boys on the outside, and
girls on the inside.

42:04.162 --> 42:05.334
Where are you?

42:07.332 --> 42:08.504
All right.

42:08.667 --> 42:10.010
Now...

42:11.378 --> 42:13.346
when the music stops...

42:13.422 --> 42:18.349
each boy dances with whichever
girl is opposite, okay?

42:18.468 --> 42:19.560
Okay!

42:20.137 --> 42:21.935
Two circles, kids!

42:26.893 --> 42:28.691
Well, it won't hurt you to try.

42:29.438 --> 42:31.361
It hurts. It hurts! It hurts.

42:31.898 --> 42:33.150
Snowboy.

42:54.504 --> 42:55.721
I'm with it.

43:17.402 --> 43:20.155
That's it, kids! Keep the ball rolling.

43:20.322 --> 43:24.668
Round she goes, and where
she stops, nobody knows.

43:24.743 --> 43:26.586
All right, here we go.

43:29.164 --> 43:32.338
Boys to my right, and girls to my left.

44:03.031 --> 44:04.704
- Mambo!
- Mambo!

44:05.158 --> 44:06.250
Go!

44:22.634 --> 44:23.977
Tony!

44:38.191 --> 44:39.363
Mambo!

44:54.958 --> 44:56.130
Mambo!

50:14.689 --> 50:17.238
You're not thinking I'm someone else?

50:17.859 --> 50:19.577
I know you are not.

50:23.657 --> 50:25.625
Or that we've met before?

50:26.534 --> 50:28.252
I know we have not.

50:29.704 --> 50:31.047
I felt...

50:31.873 --> 50:35.047
I knew something never before was
gonna happen, had to happen...

50:35.126 --> 50:36.469
but this is so much more.

50:36.544 --> 50:38.512
My hands are cold.

50:43.093 --> 50:44.470
Yours, too.

50:52.227 --> 50:53.774
So warm.

50:59.359 --> 51:01.282
So beautiful.

51:02.278 --> 51:03.621
Beautiful.

51:10.453 --> 51:12.376
It's so much to believe.

51:14.082 --> 51:16.050
You're not making a joke?

51:17.919 --> 51:20.843
I have not yet learned
how to joke that way.

51:22.298 --> 51:24.300
I think now I never will.

51:59.419 --> 52:02.047
- Get your hands off, American!
- Nardo!

52:02.130 --> 52:03.803
- Stay away from my sister.
- Sister?

52:03.882 --> 52:06.226
- Couldn't you see he's one of them?
- I saw only him.

52:06.301 --> 52:08.429
They want one thing from
a Puerto Rican girl.

52:08.511 --> 52:09.637
- That's a lie!
- Later, Tony!

52:09.721 --> 52:11.439
- Get away!
- Don't listen.

52:11.514 --> 52:13.608
She'll listen to me before
she listens to you.

52:13.683 --> 52:14.900
If you two want to settle this...

52:14.976 --> 52:17.775
Please, boys!
Everything was going so well.

52:17.854 --> 52:21.199
Now, come on! We're all here to
have a good time, aren't we?

52:21.274 --> 52:22.651
Nardo...

52:27.614 --> 52:29.412
Take her out of here. We're going home.

52:29.491 --> 52:33.291
- Nardo, it is my first dance.
- Please. We are family. Now go.

52:44.672 --> 52:46.094
Come, Maria.

52:51.679 --> 52:52.896
Maria.

52:59.145 --> 53:02.024
- I don't want you.
- I want you, though.

53:11.950 --> 53:15.204
I want you for a war council.
Jets and Sharks.

53:15.703 --> 53:18.832
- The pleasure is mine.
- Let's go outside.

53:18.915 --> 53:22.294
I would not leave the ladies here
alone with your kind around.

53:22.377 --> 53:24.050
We will meet you at midnight.

53:24.712 --> 53:26.339
Doc's candy store?

53:27.132 --> 53:29.180
And no jazz before then.

53:29.801 --> 53:31.895
I understand the rules...

53:32.512 --> 53:33.889
native boy.

53:35.390 --> 53:36.482
Ice.

53:41.855 --> 53:45.280
- Doc's at midnight. Spread the word.
- Right, daddy-o.

to spoil your evening...

56:32.525 --> 56:33.993
or to hear myself talk.

56:34.068 --> 56:36.787
- I am here longer than you, Maria.
- Sí, Nardo.

56:36.863 --> 56:39.616
Someday, when you're an old
married woman with five kids...

56:39.699 --> 56:43.203
you can tell me what to do.
But right now it is the other way around.

56:43.286 --> 56:44.788
Now go to bed.

56:45.580 --> 56:47.924
He's the old married woman.

56:53.963 --> 56:56.682
You know, she has a mother.
Also a father.

56:56.758 --> 56:59.261
They do not know this country
any better than she does.

56:59.344 --> 57:02.689
And you do not know it at all.
Girls here are free to have fun.

57:02.764 --> 57:07.611
- She is in America now.
- Puerto Rico is in America now.

57:11.022 --> 57:15.277
Sometimes I don't know which is
thicker, your skull or your accent.

57:19.197 --> 57:20.949
Vámonos, muchachos!

57:21.366 --> 57:23.789
Let them wait. Is Maria all right?

57:23.868 --> 57:26.838
- I should be so all right.
- It will not happen again.

57:26.913 --> 57:29.962
Pepe, Indio, after tonight,
things will be settled.

57:30.041 --> 57:32.885
- First settle your stomach.
- Never mind my stomach.

57:32.960 --> 57:37.841
- I mind your nose and your head broken.
- Broken?

57:37.965 --> 57:40.969
Sure! They use Maria for an
excuse to start World War III.

57:41.219 --> 57:45.224
- It is more than that.
- More than what? She was only dancing.

57:45.306 --> 57:49.652
- With an American who's really a Polack.
- Says the Spic.

57:52.230 --> 57:53.823
You are not so cute.

57:53.981 --> 57:56.359
- That Tony is.
- And he works.

57:56.442 --> 57:59.070
- A delivery boy.
- And what are you?

57:59.153 --> 58:00.200
An assistant.

58:00.279 --> 58:02.953
Sí, and Chino makes half
of what the Polack makes.

58:03.032 --> 58:05.205
Here comes the whole commercial!

58:05.284 --> 58:07.582
Your mother's a Pole,
your father's a Swede...

58:07.662 --> 58:09.881
But you were born here,
that's all that you need.

58:09.956 --> 58:14.052
You are an American.
But us? Foreigners!

58:14.127 --> 58:16.505
Lice! Cockroaches!

58:16.587 --> 58:17.804
But it's true!

58:18.506 --> 58:21.476
When I think of how I thought
it would be for us here...

58:21.551 --> 58:25.522
- we came like children believing...
- Trusting with our hearts open!

58:25.596 --> 58:29.692
- With our arms open.
- You came with your mouth open.

58:31.018 --> 58:33.112
You're the Spic, and you
go back in handcuffs.

58:33.187 --> 58:34.939
I'm going back in a Cadillac.

58:35.022 --> 58:36.945
- Air-conditioned!
- Built-in bar!

58:37.024 --> 58:38.742
- Telephone!
- And television!

58:38.818 --> 58:40.070
Compatible color.

58:40.611 --> 58:43.865
If you had all that here, why would
you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?

58:43.948 --> 58:47.578
Or even if you didn't have all that here,
why would you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?

58:47.660 --> 58:50.288
- It's so good here?
- It's so good there?

58:50.371 --> 58:51.873
We had nothing!

58:52.457 --> 58:55.711
We still have nothing,
only more expensive.

- You leave me alone. At least I let...

01:01:54.053 --> 01:01:56.431
Once an immigrant, always an immigrant!

01:01:56.514 --> 01:01:59.518
Look! Instead of a shampoo,
she's been brainwashed!

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.647
Stop it!

01:02:00.726 --> 01:02:04.026
She has given up Puerto Rico, and
now she's queer for Uncle Sam.

01:02:04.355 --> 01:02:05.572
No.

01:07:26.051 --> 01:07:27.303

01:07:27.386 --> 01:07:30.230

01:07:32.808 --> 01:07:33.900

- Please.

01:09:04.066 --> 01:09:06.194
My mother and father will wake up.

01:09:06.484 --> 01:09:08.158
Just for a minute.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:11.323
- A minute is not enough.
- For an hour, then.

01:09:11.407 --> 01:09:12.453
I cannot.

01:09:12.533 --> 01:09:15.377
Then forever. Then I'm coming up.

01:09:15.661 --> 01:09:16.832

Momentito, papá.

01:09:20.499 --> 01:09:22.546
- Now see what you've done?
- Momentito, Maria.

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:23.877
Cállate.

01:09:26.212 --> 01:09:29.888
- It is dangerous. If Bernardo knew...
- We will let him know.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.015
I'm not one of 'em, Maria.

01:09:32.176 --> 01:09:35.522
But you are not one of us,
and I am not one of you.

01:09:35.596 --> 01:09:38.145

01:09:38.225 --> 01:09:40.227

No.

He's like Bernardo, afraid.

01:10:00.539 --> 01:10:03.383

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.308
- We don't get no love there.

- Aren't you up a little late, Baby John?
- I got insomnia, Doc. Too many worries.

01:22:59.484 --> 01:23:02.408
- Any of you seen Tony tonight?
- You betcha we did.

01:23:02.487 --> 01:23:04.239
He was supposed to clean up the store.

01:23:04.322 --> 01:23:06.871
Maybe he decided to clean
up the PR's instead.

01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:07.997
Tony?

01:23:11.162 --> 01:23:14.041
- Doc, you ain't gonna close up now.
- I'm not?

01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:16.876
- Listen, we got a war council here.
- A who?

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.930
To determine weapons.
We gotta set up a mix with the PR's.

01:23:20.004 --> 01:23:22.598
Weapons. You couldn't play basketball?

01:23:22.799 --> 01:23:25.723
- Get with it, buster.
- You don't understand.

01:23:25.885 --> 01:23:27.887
We got special business
comin' here tonight.

01:23:27.971 --> 01:23:31.396
- Makin' trouble for the Puerto Ricans?
- They make trouble for us.

01:23:31.474 --> 01:23:33.226
For you, trouble is a relief.

01:23:33.559 --> 01:23:35.937
We gotta stand up to 'em, Doc.
It's important.

01:23:36.187 --> 01:23:39.566
Fightin' over a little piece
of street is so important?

01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:41.617
- To us, it is!
- To hoodlums, it is.

01:23:41.693 --> 01:23:42.785
Who you calling hoodlum?

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:44.407
- War council...
- Don't start that.

01:23:44.487 --> 01:23:47.707
- Rumbles. Why, when I was your age...
- When you was my age!

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:50.785
When my old man was my age,
my brother was my age...

01:23:51.077 --> 01:23:53.205
You was never my age, none of ya.

01:23:53.496 --> 01:23:56.921
And the sooner you creeps get hip
to that, the sooner you'll dig us!

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.628
I'll dig you an early grave,
that's what I'll dig.

01:23:59.711 --> 01:24:01.213
Dig, dig, dig!

01:24:45.256 --> 01:24:49.306
- Okay, Doc, set 'em up. Cokes all around.
- Let's get down to business.

01:24:49.385 --> 01:24:52.480
So, Bernardo hasn't learned the
procedures of gracious living.

01:24:52.555 --> 01:24:55.729
I don't like you, either, so cut it.

01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:56.897
Okay, kick it, Dos.

01:24:56.976 --> 01:24:59.855
- Boys, couldn't you maybe talk...
- Kick it!

01:25:15.745 --> 01:25:19.750
We challenge you to a rumble.
All out, once and for all. Accept?

01:25:20.458 --> 01:25:21.960
On what terms?

01:25:22.418 --> 01:25:26.139
Whatever terms you're callin'.
You crossed the line once too often.

01:25:26.214 --> 01:25:28.717
- You started it.
- Who jumped Baby John this afternoon?

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.643
Who jumped me the first
clay I moved here?

01:25:30.718 --> 01:25:32.641
- Who asked you to move here?
- Who asked you?

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.142
- Back where you came from.
- Spies.

01:25:34.222 --> 01:25:35.724
- Mick!
- Wop!

01:25:43.815 --> 01:25:45.067
We accept.

01:25:46.484 --> 01:25:48.202
- Time?
- Tomorrow?

01:25:48.778 --> 01:25:50.155
After dark.

01:25:53.699 --> 01:25:55.793
- Place?
- The park?

01:25:58.496 --> 01:25:59.793
The river.

01:26:04.335 --> 01:26:05.712
Under the highway.

01:26:09.382 --> 01:26:12.010
- Weapons?
- Doc! Doc!

01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:14.512
- Tony!
- Weapons!

01:26:18.683 --> 01:26:19.855
Weapons.

01:26:20.184 --> 01:26:22.232
- You call.
- Your challenge.

01:26:23.813 --> 01:26:25.315
Afraid to call?

01:26:29.652 --> 01:26:30.824
Rocks.

01:26:31.446 --> 01:26:32.618
Belts.

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:34.748
- Pipes.
- Cans.

01:26:35.199 --> 01:26:36.451
- Bricks.
- Bats.

01:26:36.534 --> 01:26:37.626
- Clubs.
- Chains.

01:26:37.702 --> 01:26:39.545
Bottles, knives, guns!

01:26:40.163 --> 01:26:43.633
- What a coop full of chickens.
- Who are you callin' chicken?

01:26:43.708 --> 01:26:46.302
- Every dog knows his own.
- I'm calling you all chicken!

01:26:46.502 --> 01:26:50.223
Big, tough buddy boys gotta throw bricks.
Afraid to get in close?

01:26:50.423 --> 01:26:52.846
Afraid to slug it out?
Afraid to use plain skin?

01:26:53.092 --> 01:26:55.060
- Not even garbage?
- That ain't a rumble.

01:26:55.136 --> 01:26:56.934
- Who says?
- You said call weapons.

01:26:57.847 --> 01:27:01.852
A rumble can be clinched by a fair fight,
if you've got the guts to risk that.

01:27:01.934 --> 01:27:04.357
Best man from each gang to slug it out.

01:27:05.897 --> 01:27:08.025
I would enjoy to risk that.

01:27:08.483 --> 01:27:09.860
Okay. Fair fight.

01:27:09.942 --> 01:27:12.912
Wait a minute!
The commanders say yes or no.

01:27:15.448 --> 01:27:16.825
Fair fight.

01:27:19.118 --> 01:27:23.464
When I get through with you, you
will be like a fish after skinning.

01:27:23.748 --> 01:27:26.171
Your best man fights our best man.

01:27:26.501 --> 01:27:29.300
And we pick him.

01:27:30.588 --> 01:27:33.933
- But I thought I would be fighting with...
- You shook on it.

01:27:36.969 --> 01:27:38.687
Yes. I shook on it.

01:27:38.763 --> 01:27:41.186
Look, Bernardo, if you
wanna change your mind...

01:27:51.943 --> 01:27:53.536
Bernardo, baby, would
you like a cigarette?

01:27:53.611 --> 01:27:56.114
No, thank you. I don't smoke.

01:28:00.284 --> 01:28:02.082
Evening, Lieutenant.

01:28:02.328 --> 01:28:04.581
I and Tony was just closing up.

01:28:07.542 --> 01:28:09.965
Now, this is more like it, fellas.

01:28:10.336 --> 01:28:12.555
Warms me all over to see you this way.

01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:16.305
And after only a couple of words from
me at the playground. How about that?

01:28:16.968 --> 01:28:18.265
Do you mind?

01:28:18.386 --> 01:28:21.139
I have no mind. I'm the village idiot.

01:28:22.682 --> 01:28:26.107
You know, headquarters hears about
this, I may even get a promotion.

01:28:26.978 --> 01:28:29.276
Good deal all around, Bernardo?

01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:31.862
I get a promotion...

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.370
and you Puerto Ricans get what
you've been itchin' for...

01:28:35.778 --> 01:28:38.372
use of the playground,
use of the gym...

01:28:38.447 --> 01:28:40.575
the streets, the candy store.

01:28:41.701 --> 01:28:45.501
So what if they do turn this whole
town into a stinkin' pigsty?

01:28:46.122 --> 01:28:49.422
Don't stop him! He wants to get
home, write letters to San Juan...

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.673
tell 'em how he's got
it made over here!

01:28:52.545 --> 01:28:56.516
What I mean is, clear out, you!
I said, clear out!

01:29:00.261 --> 01:29:02.184
Yeah, sure, I know.

01:29:02.972 --> 01:29:07.227
It's a free country, and I ain't got the right.
But I got a badge.

01:29:08.269 --> 01:29:09.862
What do you got?

01:29:10.521 --> 01:29:13.365
Things are tough all over. Beat it!

01:29:45.598 --> 01:29:46.975
Okay, fellas...

01:29:48.684 --> 01:29:50.982
where's the rumble gonna be?

01:29:52.396 --> 01:29:53.488
Come on!

01:29:53.564 --> 01:29:56.113
Regular Americans don't rub
with the gold teeth unless...

01:29:56.192 --> 01:29:58.695
- Lieutenant...
- You shut your mouth!

01:30:01.572 --> 01:30:03.415
Come on, Baby John.

01:30:03.991 --> 01:30:07.040
Before that smooth little kisser
of yours gets out up for life.

01:30:07.119 --> 01:30:08.746
Now, where's it gonna be?

01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:10.456
The river?

01:30:11.248 --> 01:30:12.545
The park?

01:30:16.504 --> 01:30:18.506
Look, fellas, I'm for you.

01:30:18.923 --> 01:30:21.847
I want this beat cleaned up,
and you can do it for me.

01:30:21.926 --> 01:30:26.272
I'll even lend a hand if things get rough.
Now, where you gonna rumble?

01:30:29.433 --> 01:30:30.980
The playground?

01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:34.772
Sweeney's lot?

01:30:41.362 --> 01:30:44.366
Why don't you get smart,
you stupid hooligans?

01:30:44.448 --> 01:30:47.543
I ought to take you to the station
and throw you in the can now!

01:30:47.618 --> 01:30:50.792
You and the tinhorn immigrant
scum you come from!

01:30:53.165 --> 01:30:55.588
How's your old man's DT's, A-Rab?

01:30:58.212 --> 01:31:02.058
How's the action on your mother's
side of the street, Action?

01:31:02.633 --> 01:31:05.227
One of these days, there won't
be anybody to hold you.

01:31:05.302 --> 01:31:08.306
Get him out of here!
Come on! Beat it! Go!

01:31:08.806 --> 01:31:11.525
Don't worry!
I'll find out where it's gonna be.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:15.650
So be sure to finish each other off,
because if you don't, I will!

01:31:25.322 --> 01:31:26.824
Yeah, sure.

01:31:27.241 --> 01:31:28.709
Understand them.

01:31:29.118 --> 01:31:32.964
That's what they keep telling me
down at headquarters. "Understand."

01:31:33.622 --> 01:31:37.468
You try keeping hoodlums in line,
and see what it does to you.

01:31:40.671 --> 01:31:43.595
It wouldn't give me a mouth like his.

01:31:47.678 --> 01:31:49.146
Come on, Doc.

01:31:49.513 --> 01:31:52.187
- Don't let it get you.
- I'm sick.

01:31:52.975 --> 01:31:57.401
- You heard. It's gonna be a fair fight.
- And that's gonna cure somethin'?

01:31:57.688 --> 01:32:00.942
From here on in, everything's
gonna be all right.

01:32:01.525 --> 01:32:04.278
- Got a feelin'.
- What have you been takin' tonight?

01:32:04.361 --> 01:32:07.706
A trip to the moon!
And I'll tell you a secret, Doc.

01:32:07.907 --> 01:32:10.877
It ain't a man that's up there.
it's a girl.

01:32:12.119 --> 01:32:13.336
A lady.

01:32:16.415 --> 01:32:19.544
- Buenas noches, señor
- Buenas noches?

01:32:21.128 --> 01:32:23.472
So that's why you made it a fair fight.

01:32:23.547 --> 01:32:25.549
I'm gonna see her tomorrow,
and I can't wait.

01:32:25.633 --> 01:32:28.887
Tony! Things aren't tough enough?

01:32:29.053 --> 01:32:31.897
- Tough? Doc, I'm in love!
- And you're not frightened?

01:32:31.972 --> 01:32:33.394
Should I be?

01:32:35.017 --> 01:32:36.064
No.

01:32:37.144 --> 01:32:40.148
No, I'm frightened enough
for the both of you.

01:35:31.402 --> 01:35:33.404
What has Chino done to her?

01:35:33.654 --> 01:35:35.873
Chino? Why Chino?

01:35:35.948 --> 01:35:39.919
- Maybe she's just dolling up for us.
- Gracias, querida.

01:35:40.077 --> 01:35:44.799
Rosalie, Consuelo, my adorable
friends, can you keep a secret?

01:35:44.873 --> 01:35:46.625
I'm hot for secrets.

01:35:48.544 --> 01:35:50.342
No. I won't tell you.

01:35:51.088 --> 01:35:52.465
- What?
- "What?"

01:35:52.548 --> 01:35:54.391
The poor girl is out of her mind.

01:35:54.466 --> 01:35:55.934
I am! Crazy.

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:59.104
She might be at that.
She looks somehow different.

01:35:59.471 --> 01:36:02.350
- I do?
- And I think she is up to something.

01:36:02.433 --> 01:36:03.855
I am?

01:36:04.018 --> 01:36:07.022
"I do? I am?" She talks like a parrot.

01:36:07.104 --> 01:36:09.152

01:38:59.359 --> 01:39:02.863
But Madam Lucia, what can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.

01:39:02.946 --> 01:39:03.947
Sure.

01:39:04.031 --> 01:39:06.409
You make the bad joke home
where I can't hear it.

01:39:06.491 --> 01:39:11.122
- Go now. Go home. it's closing time. Shoo!
- Buenas noches, Madam Lucia.

01:39:12.956 --> 01:39:14.583
- You put down the shades?
- Yes.

01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:16.969
Turn off the lights,
and lock the doors.

01:39:18.295 --> 01:39:21.094
- Buenas noches, Anita.
- Buenas noches.

01:39:21.632 --> 01:39:24.977
- Adiós
- The jail is open.

01:39:25.052 --> 01:39:26.770
I thought she'd never leave.

01:39:26.845 --> 01:39:28.913
You know, it's hard to believe
that old bag of a witch

01:39:28.914 --> 01:39:30.355
was once a young bag like us.

01:39:31.099 --> 01:39:33.852
Come on, let's go before she
changes her mind and comes back.

01:39:33.936 --> 01:39:36.735
You go, querida. I will lock up.

01:39:37.064 --> 01:39:39.283
- Why?
- I have work.

01:39:39.358 --> 01:39:40.826
Do it tomorrow.

01:39:41.318 --> 01:39:43.662
- I'm in no hurry.
- I am!

01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:47.120
I'm going home now and take
a nice, long bubble bath.

01:39:47.699 --> 01:39:50.828
- Black orchid.
- Black orchid?

01:39:51.578 --> 01:39:52.955
All over.

01:39:53.372 --> 01:39:55.670
I gotta date with Nardo
after the rumble.

01:39:56.291 --> 01:39:57.668
What rumble?

01:39:58.919 --> 01:40:00.519
Oh...well, uh...

01:40:00.545 --> 01:40:03.219
Nardo's Sharks and those
boys at the dance.

01:40:03.465 --> 01:40:05.684
They fight each other tonight?

01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:07.552
They don't play patsy.

01:40:10.305 --> 01:40:12.353
Why must they always fight?

01:40:12.432 --> 01:40:16.312
You saw how they dance, like they
gotta get rid of something quick.

01:40:16.395 --> 01:40:18.272
That's how they fight.

01:40:18.605 --> 01:40:20.357
To get rid of what?

01:40:20.816 --> 01:40:24.320
Too much feeling.
And they do get rid of it.

01:40:24.569 --> 01:40:28.119
Boy, after a fight, that brother
of yours is so healthy.

01:40:28.865 --> 01:40:31.118
Definitely black orchid.

01:40:42.796 --> 01:40:44.298
Buenas noches.

01:40:45.549 --> 01:40:48.678
"You go, querida. I will lock up."

01:40:51.847 --> 01:40:53.394
It's too early for noches.

01:40:53.598 --> 01:40:55.100
Buenas tardes.

01:40:55.851 --> 01:40:57.228
Gracias...

01:40:58.854 --> 01:40:59.855
buenas tardes.

01:40:59.938 --> 01:41:03.033
He just came from the
drugstore to deliver aspirin.

01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:04.493
You'll need it.

01:41:04.568 --> 01:41:07.196
Not us. We're fine.

01:41:07.738 --> 01:41:10.958
- We're out of the world.
- You're out of your heads.

01:41:11.408 --> 01:41:14.582
- We're 12 feet in the air.
- Anita can see that.

01:41:19.708 --> 01:41:21.381
You will not tell?

01:41:24.963 --> 01:41:26.135
Tell what?

01:41:26.214 --> 01:41:29.058
How can I know what goes
on 12 feet over my head?

01:41:31.303 --> 01:41:34.056
You better be home in 15 minutes.

01:41:43.023 --> 01:41:45.321
It's all right. She likes us.

01:41:46.193 --> 01:41:49.788
- But she is worried, and so am I.
- That's foolish.

01:41:49.905 --> 01:41:51.623
Are you going to that rumble tonight?

01:41:51.698 --> 01:41:53.496
- No.
- Yes!

01:41:54.117 --> 01:41:56.495
- Why?
- You must go and stop it.

01:41:56.578 --> 01:42:00.299
I have stopped it. It'll only be a
fistfight between two of 'em. Nardo...

01:42:00.374 --> 01:42:02.502
Any fight is no good for us.

01:42:02.793 --> 01:42:06.798
- Everything is good for us. We got magic.
- Listen and hear me.

01:42:07.672 --> 01:42:09.345
You must go and stop it.

01:42:10.842 --> 01:42:12.594
It means that much to you?

01:42:12.677 --> 01:42:13.769
Yes.

01:42:14.721 --> 01:42:16.394
All right, I will, then.

01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.642
I believe you.

01:42:19.101 --> 01:42:21.604
- You do have magic.
- Of course.

01:42:23.105 --> 01:42:24.573
I've got you.

01:42:25.607 --> 01:42:28.827
And tonight, after I stop the
rumble that isn't a rumble...

01:42:28.902 --> 01:42:29.949
I'll come by for you.

01:42:30.028 --> 01:42:32.827
- I will wait for you on the roof.
- No.

01:42:33.657 --> 01:42:34.954
Not the roof.

01:42:35.409 --> 01:42:36.911
I'll come to your house.

01:42:37.327 --> 01:42:39.580
You cannot. My mama.

01:42:41.915 --> 01:42:44.668
- Then I'll take you to my house.
- Your mama?

01:42:47.462 --> 01:42:49.885
She'll come runnin' from the
kitchen to welcome you.

01:42:49.965 --> 01:42:52.969
- She lives in the kitchen.
- Dressed so elegant?

01:42:53.051 --> 01:42:56.726
I told her you were coming.
She'll look at your face. Try not to smile.

01:42:56.805 --> 01:43:00.435
She'll say, "Skinny, but pretty."

01:43:01.726 --> 01:43:03.603
She is plump, no doubt?

01:43:04.354 --> 01:43:05.355
Fat.

01:43:05.689 --> 01:43:08.738
I take after my mama. Delicate-boned.

01:43:12.279 --> 01:43:14.077
Not in front of Mama!

01:43:15.907 --> 01:43:18.831
I would like to see Papa in this.

01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:20.753
Mama will make him ask
about your prospects.

01:43:20.829 --> 01:43:21.921
Many.

01:43:21.997 --> 01:43:24.591
- If you go to church.
- Always.

01:43:26.501 --> 01:43:28.924
Yes, Papa might like you.

01:43:31.339 --> 01:43:34.764
- May I have your daughter's hand?
- He says, "Yes."

01:43:35.886 --> 01:43:37.138
Gracias.

01:43:37.888 --> 01:43:40.937
- And your mama?
- I'm afraid to ask her.

01:43:41.057 --> 01:43:45.187
Tell her she's not getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.

01:43:47.814 --> 01:43:49.157
She says, "Yes!"

01:43:49.232 --> 01:43:51.030
She has good taste.

01:43:52.068 --> 01:43:54.162
Here. Maid of honor.

01:43:54.404 --> 01:43:58.034
- That color is bad for Anita.
- The best man!

01:43:58.116 --> 01:43:59.743
That is my papa!

01:44:01.244 --> 01:44:02.746
Sorry, Papa.

01:44:04.789 --> 01:44:07.417
Here we go, Riff. Womb to tomb.

01:44:07.918 --> 01:44:11.548
Now, you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.

01:44:14.758 --> 01:44:17.136
Look! Mama's crying already.

01:44:51.044 --> 01:44:52.466
I, Anton...

01:44:52.796 --> 01:44:54.719

- Now, move in and shake hands.
- For what?

01:52:13.861 --> 01:52:15.738
That's the way it's done, buddy boy.

01:52:16.531 --> 01:52:18.408
More gracious living?

01:52:18.825 --> 01:52:22.045
Look, every one of you hates every
one of us, and we hate you back.

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:23.337
Let's get at it.

01:52:23.413 --> 01:52:25.336
- Sure.
- Here we go.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.514
- Let's get in there...
- Come on, Ice.

01:52:36.592 --> 01:52:38.265
Come on, Ice, come on!

01:52:41.431 --> 01:52:43.274
Keep your eyes open!

01:52:44.642 --> 01:52:46.064
Hold it!

01:52:48.104 --> 01:52:51.779
Tony! Get with the gang. It's all okay.

01:52:51.858 --> 01:52:52.950
No!

01:52:53.317 --> 01:52:54.409
Tony, what are you doing?

01:52:54.485 --> 01:52:57.159
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battles.

01:52:58.698 --> 01:53:03.078
It don't take guts if you got a battle.
We ain't got one. None of us.

01:53:03.786 --> 01:53:05.459
- Okay, Nardo?
- Tony!

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.134
Hold it! Now, let's just cool it.

01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:11.799
The deal is, a fair fight
between you and Ice.

01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:15.595
- Come on, get with the gang.
- Mother hen protecting the little one?

01:53:15.673 --> 01:53:18.142
- I'll give you a battle.
- You've got one!

01:53:18.217 --> 01:53:20.561
I'll take pretty boy as a warm-up.

01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:23.939
Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, gutless?

01:53:24.432 --> 01:53:25.854
- Afraid, chicken?
- Cut it!

01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:27.147
No!

01:53:29.187 --> 01:53:31.656
- I don't wanna, Bernardo.
- I'm sure.

01:53:31.731 --> 01:53:33.449
- Now, listen to me.
- Are you chicken?

01:53:33.524 --> 01:53:35.743
- There's no need to fight.
- The hell there ain't!

01:53:35.818 --> 01:53:37.820
- You've got it wrong!
- Chicken!

01:53:39.238 --> 01:53:41.832
- Why can't you understand?
- Understand, chicken!

01:53:42.241 --> 01:53:44.414
- Get out of here!
- Kill him, Tony!

01:53:44.494 --> 01:53:45.746
Come on!

01:53:46.496 --> 01:53:48.965
- Afraid to fight?
- Come on.

01:53:49.499 --> 01:53:52.343
- Let me see you fight.
- Chicken boy!

01:53:53.795 --> 01:53:55.513
He is chicken!

01:55:57.214 --> 01:55:59.342
Pretty boy. Listen to him!

01:55:59.549 --> 01:56:02.678
Don't! Stop it!
We got nothin' to fight about.

01:56:03.261 --> 01:56:05.889
- Bernardo!
- Yellow-bellied chicken!

01:56:05.972 --> 01:56:09.317
- Don't push me!
- Come on, you yellow-bellied Polack!

01:56:23.031 --> 01:56:26.285
- Riff! What are you doin'?
- Get outta here, Tony!

01:56:26.535 --> 01:56:29.209
- Riff, don't!
- Hold him!

01:56:30.539 --> 01:56:31.882
Let me go!

01:56:42.217 --> 01:56:43.389
Riff, don't!

01:56:55.730 --> 01:56:57.403
Keep outta this!

01:56:58.817 --> 01:57:00.490
Somebody stop him!

01:57:00.986 --> 01:57:02.329
Let me go!

01:57:03.238 --> 01:57:04.330
Ice!

01:57:04.573 --> 01:57:05.745
Tiger!

01:57:31.933 --> 01:57:33.059
Riff!

01:57:39.191 --> 01:57:41.114
- Come on, Nardo!
- Stop him!

01:57:43.904 --> 01:57:45.372
Riff, don't!

01:58:16.061 --> 01:58:17.153
Get them!

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:49.492
Maria!

01:59:59.414 --> 02:00:01.758
Tony, come on! Come on, Tony!

02:00:01.958 --> 02:00:03.801
We gotta get out of here! Come on!

02:00:07.255 --> 02:00:09.758
Come on, Tony! Come on!

02:00:09.883 --> 02:00:11.305
Get outta here!

02:00:23.271 --> 02:00:24.523
Come on!

02:00:30.862 --> 02:00:32.409
Come on, Tony!

02:00:56.071 --> 02:01:00.071
Inserted comments without subtitles
(about 3 minutes)

02:02:49.097 --> 02:02:50.770
Wait for me, Rosa.

02:03:58.291 --> 02:03:59.463
Chino!

02:04:00.377 --> 02:04:02.550
There was no one downstairs.

02:04:03.088 --> 02:04:06.638
My mother and father are at the store.
I didn't expect you to come by.

02:04:06.716 --> 02:04:08.514
- I would have waited down...
- Maria.

02:04:09.010 --> 02:04:12.059
- You have been fighting, Chino?
- Yes.

02:04:12.639 --> 02:04:15.392
- I am sorry.
- That is not like you.

02:04:15.892 --> 02:04:18.270
- No.
- You must go home and wash up.

02:04:18.895 --> 02:04:21.648
- I will see you tomorrow.
- Maria, at the rumble...

02:04:21.731 --> 02:04:23.825
- There was no rumble.
- There was.

02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:25.493
- No. You are wrong.
- There was.

02:04:25.568 --> 02:04:27.696
Nobody meant for it to happen.

02:04:33.493 --> 02:04:34.585
Tell me.

02:04:36.246 --> 02:04:37.589
It is bad.

02:04:38.748 --> 02:04:40.170
Very bad?

02:04:42.377 --> 02:04:43.720
You see...

02:04:47.298 --> 02:04:50.097
It will be easier if
you say it very fast.

02:04:51.261 --> 02:04:52.934
There was a fight.

02:04:54.305 --> 02:04:55.727
And Nardo...

02:04:56.433 --> 02:04:58.106
Somehow a knife...

02:04:59.227 --> 02:05:01.821
- And Nardo and someone, they...
- Tony.

02:05:03.398 --> 02:05:05.275
What happened to Tony?

02:05:06.317 --> 02:05:09.446
Chino, tell me! Is Tony all right?

02:05:12.615 --> 02:05:14.492
He killed your brother!

02:05:22.083 --> 02:05:23.585
You are lying.

02:05:24.502 --> 02:05:26.721
Chino, why do you lie to me?

02:05:31.301 --> 02:05:33.770
Chino, true, you are lying! Why?

02:05:33.845 --> 02:05:35.768
Why do you lie to me, Chino?

02:05:36.931 --> 02:05:38.433
Mama! Mama!

02:05:38.683 --> 02:05:42.233
- Bernardo está muerto!
- Bernardo, muerto?

02:05:42.312 --> 02:05:43.484
No!

02:05:50.653 --> 02:05:55.329
Santa María, make it not be true.
Please make it not be true.

02:05:55.533 --> 02:05:59.754
Madre de Dios, I will do anything.
Make me die!

02:05:59.829 --> 02:06:02.173
Only, please, make it not be true.

02:06:06.544 --> 02:06:08.171
Make it not be...

02:06:12.842 --> 02:06:14.094
Killer!

02:06:22.018 --> 02:06:23.816
I tried to stop it.

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:26.857
I did try.

02:06:27.065 --> 02:06:31.070
I don't know what went wrong.
I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't wanna.

02:06:31.194 --> 02:06:33.162
But Riff's like my brother...

02:06:33.238 --> 02:06:37.038
when Bernardo killed him,
Bernardo didn't mean it either.

02:06:40.703 --> 02:06:42.421
I thought you knew.

02:06:46.918 --> 02:06:49.262
I didn't come to tell you that.

02:06:49.712 --> 02:06:52.807
Just for you to forgive me,
so I can go to the police.

02:06:52.882 --> 02:06:54.884
- No!
- It'll be easy now.

02:06:54.968 --> 02:06:56.515
- I won't let you!
- I must.

02:06:56.594 --> 02:06:59.598
- Stay! Stay with me.
- Maria, I love you so much!

02:06:59.681 --> 02:07:01.149
Don't leave me!

02:07:01.224 --> 02:07:02.771
Whatever you want, I'll do.

02:07:02.851 --> 02:07:05.525
- Hold me!
- Forever!

02:07:05.770 --> 02:07:06.987
Tighten

02:07:07.313 --> 02:07:11.113
it'll be all right. I know it.
We're really together now.

02:07:12.193 --> 02:07:13.786
But it's not us.

02:07:15.572 --> 02:07:17.574
It's everything around us.

02:07:18.908 --> 02:07:22.378
Then I'll take you away,
where nothing can get to us.

02:07:24.038 --> 02:07:26.416

Nothin'.

02:10:15.001 --> 02:10:17.595
What are you doin' nothin' here for?
Come on.

02:10:18.671 --> 02:10:21.299
I don't want the guys to see me, A-Rab.

02:10:21.758 --> 02:10:23.010
Why not?

02:10:23.885 --> 02:10:25.512
I'm cryin'.

02:10:26.804 --> 02:10:28.056
You are?

02:10:30.058 --> 02:10:31.310
What for?

02:10:32.018 --> 02:10:34.817
- I don't know. I'm just...
- Blow your nose.

02:10:41.235 --> 02:10:42.407
A-Rab?

02:10:42.612 --> 02:10:43.704
Yeah?

02:10:44.197 --> 02:10:46.666
Did you get a look at their faces?

02:10:48.451 --> 02:10:50.499
- Which faces?
- You know...

02:10:51.412 --> 02:10:53.790
At the rumble. Riff and Bernardo.

02:10:55.083 --> 02:10:56.175
Yeah.

02:10:59.837 --> 02:11:03.887
- I wish it was yesterday.
- Me, too. I'm scared.

02:11:03.966 --> 02:11:07.345
- Cut it out. You hear me? Cut it out!
- A-Rab, what are we gonna do?

02:11:07.428 --> 02:11:10.307
We'll meet the other guys and form up.
That's what we'll do.

02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:12.313
Now, come on. Let's go.

02:11:13.267 --> 02:11:15.110
You got a handkerchief first?

02:11:15.186 --> 02:11:16.859
What's wrong with your sleeve?

02:11:45.216 --> 02:11:48.311
- Where you been?
- Where do you think, the Stork Club?

02:11:48.386 --> 02:11:50.388
- We thought they nabbed you.
- Go on.

02:11:50.471 --> 02:11:53.190
- You didn't see Tony?
- Nothin' but coppers.

02:11:53.516 --> 02:11:54.768
What's wrong with him?

02:11:54.851 --> 02:11:57.024
There's nothin' wrong.
He's okay, you get it?

02:11:57.103 --> 02:11:58.605
All right, all right!

02:11:58.688 --> 02:12:00.861
- Maybe we oughta go home.
- For what?

02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:02.863
- Betcha they got him.
- Not Tony.

02:12:02.942 --> 02:12:06.537
- Man, he was great, right, Baby John?
- Yeah.

02:12:06.863 --> 02:12:10.868
- He really come through for the Jets.
- Just like Riff said he...

02:12:13.453 --> 02:12:14.955
Said he would.

02:12:19.709 --> 02:12:21.552
I want Riff!

02:12:23.129 --> 02:12:24.881
Come on, Graziella.

02:12:27.091 --> 02:12:29.594
Nobody was supposed to get killed.

02:12:30.761 --> 02:12:32.104
It just...

02:12:37.810 --> 02:12:39.278
They're gonna pay!

02:12:39.353 --> 02:12:41.572
- Them stinkin' Sharks.
- Dirty fighting.

02:12:41.647 --> 02:12:42.648
They started it!

02:12:42.732 --> 02:12:45.485
So why don't we finish it?
We gotta show 'em who's on top.

02:12:45.568 --> 02:12:48.538
- The Jets! Let's do it now!
- Ain't we had enough?

02:12:48.613 --> 02:12:51.833
- What's the matter, you scared?
- Who you callin' scared?

02:12:51.908 --> 02:12:53.660
- Lay off of him.
- Mind your own business.

02:12:53.743 --> 02:12:55.086
Don't sound off on me. I'll...

02:12:55.161 --> 02:12:57.710
- You'll do what?
- Knock it off!

02:13:00.458 --> 02:13:03.086
Shut up down there, you dirty

02:13:03.169 --> 02:13:04.591

02:13:07.465 --> 02:13:09.513
Come down, I'll put
this through your face!

02:13:09.592 --> 02:13:12.186
- Get inside! All of you!
- Come on!

02:13:17.767 --> 02:13:20.361
- Shut up!
- I don't have to take that from nobody!

02:13:20.436 --> 02:13:23.360
Next creep who sounds on me,
I swear the next guy...

02:13:23.439 --> 02:13:24.941
You'll laugh!

02:13:30.613 --> 02:13:31.739
Yeah.

02:13:32.782 --> 02:13:35.786
Now, you all better dig
this and dig it good!

02:13:36.244 --> 02:13:38.918

02:13:38.996 --> 02:13:41.670
man, you show it, and you are dead!

02:13:44.794 --> 02:13:49.220
You are cuttin' a hole in yourselves for
them to stick in a red-hot umbrella...

02:13:49.298 --> 02:13:51.016
and open it wide!

02:13:52.093 --> 02:13:56.348

02:21:57.149 --> 02:21:58.366
Where we goin'?

02:21:58.442 --> 02:22:00.740
If we lay low, the coppers
are gonna smell fish.

02:22:00.819 --> 02:22:03.197
- So the first thing we do...
- Buddy boy!

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:06.705
- Go wear a skirt.
- I got scabby knees. Listen...

02:22:06.784 --> 02:22:09.537
First, start showing around
like we got nothin' to hide.

02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:11.338
Suppose they ask us about the rumble.

02:22:11.413 --> 02:22:15.543
Supposin' they ask you where's Tony and
what party's lookin' for him with a gun!

02:22:15.626 --> 02:22:17.299
You know somethin'?

02:22:17.461 --> 02:22:20.510
- I know I gotta go get a skirt.
- Come on, Anybodys!

02:22:20.589 --> 02:22:22.557
- What's the freak know?
- Plenty!

02:22:22.674 --> 02:22:25.223
I figured somebody oughta
infiltrate PR territory...

02:22:25.302 --> 02:22:26.428
and spy around.

02:22:26.512 --> 02:22:28.606
I'm very large with shadows, you know.

02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:31.274
I can slip in and out of 'em
like wind through a fence.

02:22:31.350 --> 02:22:34.775
- Boy, is she ever makin' the most of it.
- You bet your fat "A," I am!

02:22:34.853 --> 02:22:36.480
- Spill it!
- Okay.

02:22:36.563 --> 02:22:40.659
I hear Chino tellin' the Sharks somethin'
about Tony and Bernardo's sister.

02:22:40.734 --> 02:22:42.236
And then I hear Chino say,

02:22:42.319 --> 02:22:45.163
"If it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna get that Polack."

02:22:45.239 --> 02:22:47.742
And then he pulls out the bad news!

02:22:48.367 --> 02:22:50.665
- Them PR's won't stop.
- Till we stop 'em.

02:22:50.744 --> 02:22:51.836
Hold it!

02:22:52.287 --> 02:22:53.504
Now, listen...

02:22:53.914 --> 02:22:57.168
Tony come through for us.
We gotta come through for Tony.

02:22:57.376 --> 02:23:00.050
- We gotta find him before Chino finds him.
- And burns him.

02:23:00.129 --> 02:23:02.302
You cover the river!
Snowboy, get over to Doc's.

02:23:02.381 --> 02:23:05.100
- I'll take the alleys.
- We'll take the streets.

02:23:05.175 --> 02:23:06.347
- The park.
- The schoolyard.

02:23:06.427 --> 02:23:07.770
We'll take the playground.

02:23:07.845 --> 02:23:09.188
What about me?

02:23:10.597 --> 02:23:13.191
You? In and out of the shadows.

02:23:13.434 --> 02:23:16.313
- Maybe you'll find Tony in one of them.
- Right!

02:23:19.815 --> 02:23:21.783
You done good, buddy boy.

02:23:22.693 --> 02:23:25.492
Thanks, daddy-o.

02:24:28.717 --> 02:24:29.934
Who is...

02:24:33.305 --> 02:24:34.477
Maria.

02:24:40.187 --> 02:24:42.406
Maria, it's Anita. You in there?

02:24:43.482 --> 02:24:45.325

- Yes.

02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:47.402

I'll be right there.

02:25:06.713 --> 02:25:08.886
- Together.
- But where?

02:25:09.967 --> 02:25:12.891
The bus station. We'll go so far
away, they'll never find us.

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:15.894
- How can we?
- Doc will help us. I'll get money from him.

02:25:15.973 --> 02:25:18.226
- You'll meet me at his store.
- At Doc's, yes.

02:25:18.308 --> 02:25:20.402
- I'll wait for you there.
- All right.

02:25:20.769 --> 02:25:21.895
Yes.

02:30:11.810 --> 02:30:15.610
- He's hunting for Tony.
- He is at Doc's store, waiting for me.

02:30:16.189 --> 02:30:19.614

him, I swear to you, I'll...

- I love Tony.

02:30:24.281 --> 02:30:25.453
I know.

02:30:26.533 --> 02:30:28.080

02:30:36.334 --> 02:30:38.336
- Anybody home?
- Yes.

02:30:40.297 --> 02:30:43.972
- Bernardo's sister, please.
- She isn't feeling well.

02:30:44.509 --> 02:30:45.726
Who is?

02:30:48.430 --> 02:30:49.807
Hello, miss.

02:30:50.432 --> 02:30:53.606
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't like to
disturb you at a time like this...

02:30:53.685 --> 02:30:57.064
Yes, a very bad time.
You'll excuse me, please.

02:30:57.147 --> 02:31:00.401
- I have a couple of questions to ask.
- Afterwards, please.

02:31:00.734 --> 02:31:03.157
- I must go to my brother now.
- Now, just one minute!

02:31:03.236 --> 02:31:05.159
- Can't you wait?
- No!

02:31:07.157 --> 02:31:08.329
Now.

02:31:08.491 --> 02:31:09.993
You were at the dance at
the gym last night...

02:31:10.076 --> 02:31:11.901
Will this take very long?

02:31:11.902 --> 02:31:13.580
As long as it has to.

02:31:14.998 --> 02:31:16.341
Excuse me.

02:31:17.667 --> 02:31:20.090
Anita, my headache is much worse.

02:31:20.170 --> 02:31:22.019
Will you go to Doc's store for me?

02:31:22.020 --> 02:31:23.925
Don't you people keep aspirin around?

02:31:24.007 --> 02:31:26.055
This is something special.

02:31:27.886 --> 02:31:29.888
Will you go for me, Anita?

02:31:35.810 --> 02:31:37.562
What shall I ask for?

02:31:38.688 --> 02:31:40.190
Doc will know.

02:31:40.857 --> 02:31:45.408
Tell him I have been detained and
can't get there right away...

02:31:46.029 --> 02:31:48.748
or I would have picked it up myself.

02:31:59.209 --> 02:32:01.587
Excuse me. You were asking?

02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:04.722
Yeah.

02:32:05.465 --> 02:32:08.639
At the gym last night, your brother
got into a heavy argument...

02:32:08.718 --> 02:32:11.562
because you danced with the wrong boy.

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:16.269
- Yes.
- Who was the boy?

02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:19.528
Another from my country.

02:32:20.438 --> 02:32:21.906
And his name?

02:32:22.774 --> 02:32:24.100
José.

02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:36.834
- Can't find him. He ain't nowhere.
- He's right down there in the cellar.

02:32:36.913 --> 02:32:38.039
- Tony?
- Safe and sound.

02:32:38.123 --> 02:32:40.501
- I found him.
- You warn him about Chino?

02:32:40.583 --> 02:32:43.928
- What's he doin' in the cellar?
- Keepin' the mice company, stupid.

02:32:44.212 --> 02:32:46.556
- No sign of Chino?
- Nothin'.

02:32:46.631 --> 02:32:47.723
His luck.

02:32:47.799 --> 02:32:49.927
I'll slip out the back and
check the alleys again.

02:32:50.010 --> 02:32:52.183
- You guys hang here.
- Right.

02:32:52.262 --> 02:32:56.563
- Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?
- Upstairs raising getaway money for Tony.

02:32:56.641 --> 02:32:59.064
- Doc ain't got no money.
- His mattress has.

02:32:59.144 --> 02:33:02.023
Come on. Cut the frabberjabber.
Grab some readin' matter.

02:33:02.105 --> 02:33:03.948
Play the juke. Some of you get outside.

02:33:04.024 --> 02:33:06.743
If you see Chino or those
stinkin' PR's comin...

02:33:18.246 --> 02:33:20.795
- I'd like to see Doc.
- He ain't here.

02:33:21.958 --> 02:33:24.302
- Where is he?
- He went to the bank.

02:33:24.377 --> 02:33:26.129
They made a mistake in his favor.

02:33:26.337 --> 02:33:29.011
The banks are closed at night.
Where is he?

02:33:29.090 --> 02:33:30.683
You know how skinny Doc is.

02:33:30.759 --> 02:33:32.761
He slipped in through
the night-deposit slot.

02:33:32.844 --> 02:33:35.267
And got stuck halfway in.

02:33:35.346 --> 02:33:38.850
Which indicates there's no
tellin' when he'll be back.

02:33:40.935 --> 02:33:43.404
Buenas noches, señorita.

02:33:52.864 --> 02:33:54.616
Where you goin'?

02:33:54.824 --> 02:33:58.328
- Downstairs.
- Didn't I tell you he ain't here?

02:33:59.162 --> 02:34:01.290
I'd like to see for myself.

02:34:03.792 --> 02:34:05.294
Please.

02:34:08.463 --> 02:34:09.680
Please.

02:34:12.342 --> 02:34:13.685
Por favor.

02:34:14.344 --> 02:34:17.689
- Will you let me pass?
- She's too dark to pass.

02:34:17.764 --> 02:34:19.437
- Don't
- Please don't.

02:34:19.516 --> 02:34:21.109
- Por favor.
- No comprende.

02:34:21.184 --> 02:34:22.481
- Gracias.
- De nada.

02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:23.607
Mambo!

02:34:23.686 --> 02:34:25.563
- Listen, you!
- We're listenin'.

02:34:25.647 --> 02:34:28.776
Look, I gotta give a
friend of yours a message.

02:34:28.858 --> 02:34:30.405
- I gotta tell Tony...
- He ain't here.

02:34:30.485 --> 02:34:32.237
- I know he is.
- Who says he is?

02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:33.913
- Who's the message from?
- Never mind.

02:34:33.988 --> 02:34:35.831
Couldn't be from Chino, could it?

02:34:35.907 --> 02:34:39.127
Don't you understand? I want to help!

02:34:39.202 --> 02:34:42.957
- Bernardo's girl wants to help?
- Even a greaseball's got feelings.

02:34:43.039 --> 02:34:45.041
- But she wants to help get Tony.
- No!

02:34:45.125 --> 02:34:48.800
- Not much. Bernardo's tramp.
- Bernardo's pig!

02:34:49.045 --> 02:34:50.843
- You lyin' Spic!
- Don't do that.

02:34:50.922 --> 02:34:52.720
- Gold tooth!
- Pierced ear!

02:34:53.133 --> 02:34:54.680
- Don't.
- Garlic mouth.

02:34:56.845 --> 02:34:59.268
- I want to help!
- Come on!

02:34:59.556 --> 02:35:01.775
- Go!
- Chiquita!

02:35:02.892 --> 02:35:03.893
No!

02:35:06.229 --> 02:35:07.822
Olé! Olé!

02:35:08.231 --> 02:35:09.403
Hey, babe!

02:35:10.066 --> 02:35:11.238
Come on!

02:35:15.572 --> 02:35:16.664
Let's get her!

02:35:16.739 --> 02:35:19.538
- No, you don't.
- Come on, baby.

02:35:28.877 --> 02:35:29.969
Come on!

02:35:30.295 --> 02:35:31.547
Stop it!

02:35:36.467 --> 02:35:38.469
What are you doing there?

02:35:58.031 --> 02:35:59.874
Bernardo was right.

02:36:01.993 --> 02:36:03.461
If one of you...

02:36:03.578 --> 02:36:07.048
was lying in the street bleeding...

02:36:07.290 --> 02:36:09.964
l'd walk by and spit on you!

02:36:10.126 --> 02:36:12.345
She'll tell Chino that
Tony's in the cellar.

02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:14.297
Don't you touch me!

02:36:17.467 --> 02:36:20.437
I got a message for
your American buddy.

02:36:21.471 --> 02:36:25.192
You tell that murderer that
Maria's never going to meet him!

02:36:26.142 --> 02:36:29.737
You tell him that Chino
found out about them...

02:36:30.063 --> 02:36:31.656
and shot her!

02:36:32.857 --> 02:36:34.234
She's dead!

02:36:38.821 --> 02:36:40.915
When do you kids stop?

02:36:42.033 --> 02:36:44.877
You make this world lousy!

02:36:45.662 --> 02:36:47.539
We didn't make it, Doc.

02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:51.167
Get outta here!

02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:22.870
Maria?

02:37:23.825 --> 02:37:26.248
Doc, I thought I heard... You got it!

02:37:26.327 --> 02:37:29.922
- Yes, I got it.
- Doc, you're a pal.

02:37:29.998 --> 02:37:32.092
You're the best friend a guy ever had.

02:37:32.166 --> 02:37:34.715
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I promise.

02:37:34.836 --> 02:37:37.589
- Forget that.
- No, I'll never! I couldn't.

02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:41.180
Doc, you know what we're gonna
do in the country, Maria and me?

02:37:41.259 --> 02:37:43.887
We'll have kids, and we'll
name 'em all after you...

02:37:43.970 --> 02:37:45.972
even the girls, so when you visit us...

02:37:46.055 --> 02:37:47.398
Wake up!

02:37:48.391 --> 02:37:51.395
Is this the only way to
get through to you...

02:37:51.936 --> 02:37:56.316
do just what you all do,
bust like a hot water pipe?

02:37:56.524 --> 02:37:57.821
What's got into you?

02:37:57.900 --> 02:38:01.279
Why do you kids live
like there's a war on?

02:38:05.825 --> 02:38:07.543
Why do you kill?

02:38:11.748 --> 02:38:13.876
I told you how it happened.

02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:16.424
Maria understands.

02:38:17.295 --> 02:38:21.425
- I thought you did, too.
- Maria understands nothing...

02:38:22.342 --> 02:38:23.764
Never again.

02:38:24.135 --> 02:38:26.388
There is no Maria, Tony.

02:38:30.433 --> 02:38:31.525
What?

02:38:33.227 --> 02:38:35.321
- I can't.
- No, no, Doc.

02:38:36.064 --> 02:38:38.362
Now, tell me. What is it?

02:38:39.442 --> 02:38:41.410
That was Anita upstairs.

02:38:42.570 --> 02:38:45.619
Chino found out about you and Maria...

02:38:46.824 --> 02:38:48.826
and he killed her.

02:38:56.459 --> 02:38:57.460
No.

02:39:02.965 --> 02:39:04.137
Maria.

02:39:12.183 --> 02:39:13.730
Not Maria, Doc.

02:39:15.186 --> 02:39:16.438
She's...

02:39:23.403 --> 02:39:24.575
Chino!

02:39:28.533 --> 02:39:30.661
Come and get me, too, Chino!

02:39:45.049 --> 02:39:47.268
- Come and get me, too!
- Tony!

02:39:47.343 --> 02:39:48.344
Who's that?

02:39:48.428 --> 02:39:51.432
- It's me, Anybodys. Come on.
- Get out of here!

02:39:51.514 --> 02:39:55.394
- Chino, come and get me, damn you!
- What are you doin'?

02:39:55.476 --> 02:39:56.898
Get out of here!

02:39:57.353 --> 02:39:59.151
Why don't you come with me?
We'll find...

02:39:59.230 --> 02:40:01.824
It ain't playin' anymore!
Can't any of you get that?

02:40:01.899 --> 02:40:05.654
- But the gang...
- You're a girl! Be a girl and beat it!

02:40:12.702 --> 02:40:15.546
Come on, Chino! Get me, too!

02:40:30.678 --> 02:40:32.806
I'm callin' for you, Chino!

02:40:33.764 --> 02:40:37.143
There's nobody here but me. Come on!

02:40:38.144 --> 02:40:39.771
Please, will you?

02:40:41.522 --> 02:40:43.399
I'm waitin' for you.

02:40:44.108 --> 02:40:45.610
I want you to.

02:40:56.829 --> 02:40:58.001
Maria.

02:40:59.248 --> 02:41:00.340
Tony!

02:41:03.836 --> 02:41:05.008
Maria.

02:41:42.792 --> 02:41:44.760
I didn't believe hard enough.

02:41:44.835 --> 02:41:46.462
Loving is enough.

02:41:47.296 --> 02:41:48.593
Not here.

02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.561
- They won't let us be.
- Then we'll get away.

02:41:57.848 --> 02:41:58.974
Yeah.

02:41:59.392 --> 02:42:00.644
- We can.
- Yes.

02:42:00.726 --> 02:42:02.103
- We will.
- Yes.

02:43:28.189 --> 02:43:30.533
How do you fire this gun, Chino?

02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:33.949
Just by pulling this little trigger?

02:43:34.528 --> 02:43:36.906
How many bullets are left, Chino?

02:43:37.698 --> 02:43:39.245
Enough for you?

02:43:39.408 --> 02:43:40.660
And you?

02:43:42.370 --> 02:43:43.747
All of you!

02:43:43.996 --> 02:43:47.717
You all killed him, and
my brother, and Riff...

02:43:48.334 --> 02:43:50.382
not with bullets and guns.

02:43:51.128 --> 02:43:52.471
With hate!

02:43:53.255 --> 02:43:57.010
I can kill, too, because
now I have hate!

02:43:57.593 --> 02:44:00.517
How many can I kill, Chino? How many?

02:44:01.097 --> 02:44:03.771
And still have one bullet left for me?

02:44:10.564 --> 02:44:11.611
No!

02:44:25.621 --> 02:44:27.749
Don't you touch him!

02:45:22.511 --> 02:45:24.605
Te adoro, Anton.
