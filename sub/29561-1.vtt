00:46.102 --> 00:47.637
Hello?

01:09.593 --> 01:12.162
Hello, is anyone here?

01:30.546 --> 01:34.951
Oh my goodness, aren't you
the cutest little thing?

05:45.368 --> 05:46.837
What?

06:10.793 --> 06:13.163
Wow, retro.

06:17.868 --> 06:18.967
Ha!

06:18.969 --> 06:20.103
Hi.

06:22.471 --> 06:24.371
Oh, my God.

06:24.373 --> 06:26.407
No, no, no, no, my fault.

06:26.409 --> 06:30.477
Note to self, don't sneak up
on the new girl.

06:30.479 --> 06:34.481
Terry Lumley, I uh live
downstairs by the laundry room.

06:34.483 --> 06:38.118
Resident handyman and
all-around helpful guy.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.921
Jennifer.

06:39.923 --> 06:42.190
Nice to meet you, oh,
thank you.

06:42.192 --> 06:43.828
Wow, so you just moved in?

06:44.894 --> 06:46.460
Uh, yeah.

06:46.462 --> 06:48.363
Yeah, looks like,
I can't believe you

06:48.365 --> 06:50.964
moved all this stuff yourself,
that's a lot of crap.

06:50.966 --> 06:52.967
If I would've known,
I could've helped you out

06:52.969 --> 06:54.137
with some of that.

06:56.038 --> 06:58.138
Actually...

06:58.140 --> 06:59.573
You got it?

06:59.575 --> 07:01.176
- Yeah I got it.
- Okay.

07:01.178 --> 07:03.077
One step at
a time, you got it.

07:03.079 --> 07:04.979
Okay, here we go, you just
have to lift with the legs,

07:04.981 --> 07:07.317
lift with the legs,
there you go.

07:24.967 --> 07:26.002
Hey.

07:28.271 --> 07:29.536
Mm.

07:29.538 --> 07:30.972
What's that guy's deal?

07:30.974 --> 07:31.972
Who, Fuzzy?

07:31.974 --> 07:33.440
Yeah.

07:33.442 --> 07:35.210
We're not 100%
sure about Fuzzy.

07:35.212 --> 07:36.945
Yeah?

07:36.947 --> 07:38.912
He doesn't seem
to have a real job,

07:38.914 --> 07:41.548
but I have my suspicious
about how he pays the rent.

07:41.550 --> 07:43.084
Really?

07:43.086 --> 07:44.421
I think he grows pot.

07:46.423 --> 07:49.257
Oh, okay,
that would make sense.

07:49.259 --> 07:50.592
You like pot?

07:51.861 --> 07:53.094
You ever smoke it?

07:53.096 --> 07:54.863
No, it's not really my thing.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.031
I, I tried it once when
I was like 15 and I,

07:57.033 --> 07:58.565
I think I slept
for like four days.

07:58.567 --> 08:01.135
Yeah.

08:01.137 --> 08:03.503
What's the deal
with the couple?

08:03.505 --> 08:06.274
The second
apartment from here.

08:06.276 --> 08:09.544
Oh yeah, Pete and Sherry.

08:09.546 --> 08:11.212
I don't know,
how can I put this,

08:11.214 --> 08:14.185
they're um,
they're trailer folk.

08:19.122 --> 08:22.359
Hey, that's a... that's quite a bruise.
How'd you manage to get that?

08:27.163 --> 08:28.566
Fell out of a trailer.

08:33.135 --> 08:35.940
I want you to meet somebody,
come on.

08:38.006 --> 08:39.640
I think the bricks
give it a lot of charm,

08:39.642 --> 08:42.613
and these lighting
fixtures are all original.

08:44.046 --> 08:45.346
What kind of trees are those?

08:45.348 --> 08:47.215
I know nothing about trees.

08:47.217 --> 08:49.616
But I'll tell you something,
just be prepared,

08:49.618 --> 08:52.522
her bark is a little
worse than her bite.

09:04.935 --> 09:05.969
What now?

09:07.637 --> 09:10.972
Claudette,
this is our new tenant.

09:10.974 --> 09:13.173
Oh yeah, McFarland, 212?

09:13.175 --> 09:16.311
Actually, it's Conrad now.

09:16.313 --> 09:17.448
Conrad, right.

09:19.648 --> 09:23.617
So, the apartment,
it looks a little bit different

09:23.619 --> 09:27.020
than it did
on the website.

09:27.022 --> 09:28.689
Hey.

09:28.691 --> 09:31.294
What the hell
did I tell you about that?

09:37.233 --> 09:39.733
God damn hippies.

09:39.735 --> 09:41.535
Yeah.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.474
So, you need something
from me, or what?

09:45.241 --> 09:47.377
No, I just wanted
to say hello.

09:48.445 --> 09:49.979
Oh, well then, hello.

09:52.681 --> 09:54.017
Thanks, Claudette.

09:58.655 --> 09:59.687
Wow.

09:59.689 --> 10:01.025
Yeah.

10:02.691 --> 10:05.693
Well, I don't know how you
plan to top that one, Terry.

10:05.695 --> 10:09.997
Well, don't be so sure,
the night is still young.

10:09.999 --> 10:14.268
We haven't seen the laundry area
or the mailboxes.

10:14.270 --> 10:15.602
Well, I stand corrected then.

10:15.604 --> 10:17.407
Oh, and the spa.

10:18.474 --> 10:20.173
You guys have a spa?

10:20.175 --> 10:23.244
No, be awesome though,
wouldn't it?

10:23.246 --> 10:25.313
Oh, the dumpsters
are really good,

10:25.315 --> 10:27.148
let me show you these over here.

11:36.453 --> 11:38.452
Jenny, listen here,

11:38.454 --> 11:40.788
we both know you are
gonna come crawlin' back

11:40.790 --> 11:42.789
sooner or later,
you ain't never done anything

11:42.791 --> 11:45.259
in your life
except maybe wait tables.

11:45.261 --> 11:47.595
Christ sakes, you don't
even cook worth a damn.

11:47.597 --> 11:49.797
Thank God
for the fuckin' microwave.

14:19.382 --> 14:20.416
Hello?

14:23.953 --> 14:25.255
Hello?

14:47.343 --> 14:49.246
Are you kidding me?

14:51.347 --> 14:52.980
Oh!

15:26.416 --> 15:27.450
Shit.

15:46.469 --> 15:47.470
Damn it.

16:25.742 --> 16:29.809
So, I see here that
the only work you have listed

16:29.811 --> 16:31.712
other than food
service is for

16:31.714 --> 16:34.515
the Weld County Highway
Patrol office?

16:34.517 --> 16:37.485
Yes, I worked there
on and off over the years

16:37.487 --> 16:38.988
doing secretarial work.

16:41.690 --> 16:44.594
You have a phone number
where I could reach them?

16:47.397 --> 16:49.532
911?

16:52.935 --> 16:57.638
Very amusing, Miss Conrad,
but you've omitted

16:57.640 --> 16:59.910
a contact for them
on your references, why is that?

17:06.516 --> 17:07.550
Complicated.

17:09.951 --> 17:16.790
So, other than that,
the only contactable references

17:16.792 --> 17:19.396
are for waitressing,
is that right?

17:20.496 --> 17:22.365
You're a waitress?

17:45.688 --> 17:49.156
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
what are you doing?

17:49.158 --> 17:51.492
I put money in the meter.

17:51.494 --> 17:52.562
You're parked in two spaces.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.868
Jenny?
Let's talk about it later.

18:00.870 --> 18:02.636
Brenda?

18:02.638 --> 18:05.538
Wowee, what has it been,
like, 10 years now?

18:05.540 --> 18:06.739
What are you doing here?

18:06.741 --> 18:08.141
I work here,
we're up on the 18th floor.

18:08.143 --> 18:09.776
What about you?

18:09.778 --> 18:12.580
I just had a job interview
on the third floor.

18:12.582 --> 18:14.014
Are you kidding?

18:14.016 --> 18:15.485
No, why?

18:19.889 --> 18:21.554
Oh, wow.

18:21.556 --> 18:23.056
They moved me up from
a project manager position

18:23.058 --> 18:25.191
last week,
and one of my first tasks

18:25.193 --> 18:28.963
is to hire and train someone
to fill my old position.

18:28.965 --> 18:30.063
Well?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.998
You, you mean me?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.801
Yeah, we could totally
use someone like you, Jenny.

18:33.803 --> 18:35.169
I mean, when I
think about the way

18:35.171 --> 18:36.871
you juggled everything
back in high school?

18:36.873 --> 18:38.938
Well, I mean,
that was high school,

18:38.940 --> 18:41.508
this is, this is, this is huge.

18:41.510 --> 18:44.078
Are you kidding me?
Softball, pep rallies,

18:44.080 --> 18:46.146
homecoming, if I had
half as much drive

18:46.148 --> 18:49.082
as Hurricane Jennifer,
I'd be CEO by now.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.284
Hurricane Jennifer, wow,

18:51.286 --> 18:53.920
I, I haven't thought
of that in years.

18:53.922 --> 18:55.989
All right look, they're
shipping me off to Beijing

18:55.991 --> 18:57.658
for three weeks
to try to save a deal,

18:57.660 --> 19:00.527
but the second I get back,
I wanna bring you in.

19:00.529 --> 19:02.530
I mean, if you want.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.931
Yeah, sure,
that would be amazing.

19:04.933 --> 19:07.935
Well, the interview'll
just basically be a formality.

19:07.937 --> 19:08.936
Thanks.

19:08.938 --> 19:09.937
Of course.

19:11.806 --> 19:13.274
You're welcome, just call
the number on that card

19:13.276 --> 19:14.975
and my assistant will put
the interview on the calendar

19:14.977 --> 19:16.810
for the end of the month, okay?

19:16.812 --> 19:17.511
Okay.

19:17.513 --> 19:18.248
All right, I'll see you later.

19:22.951 --> 19:24.119
All right.

20:57.412 --> 20:59.348
Ah!

21:08.056 --> 21:10.160
Hey Terry, what's that?

21:12.862 --> 21:13.861
What?

21:13.863 --> 21:14.863
Um.

21:17.932 --> 21:19.332
Oh, shit.

21:28.276 --> 21:29.312
Terry?

21:52.401 --> 21:53.670
Hey.

22:03.411 --> 22:05.815
Well it's nice
to meet you, Tina.

22:12.921 --> 22:14.658
Will you please be quiet?

22:29.270 --> 22:30.305
Hello?

22:35.143 --> 22:36.979
Oh, come on!

22:41.150 --> 22:42.252
There.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.131
Oh!

23:55.391 --> 23:58.995
I'm sorry, I, I just wanted...

24:30.926 --> 24:33.861
Hi, it's Jennifer.

24:33.863 --> 24:37.299
I'm sorry about before,
I just moved in.

24:40.603 --> 24:42.839
You seem really sad.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.575
Just do it, Jennifer.

25:08.162 --> 25:11.297
Hey, hey cop,
that's my shotgun.

25:11.299 --> 25:13.536
That klepto bitch
took it out of my car.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.439
Ma'am, please try
and be still for me.

25:20.441 --> 25:23.442
It's okay, okay there.

25:23.444 --> 25:26.348
Follow my finger, ma'am.

25:29.418 --> 25:32.686
Okay, you know, you're lucky,

25:32.688 --> 25:34.420
this could've been a lot worse.

25:34.422 --> 25:36.358
I didn't find any
glass in your eyes.

25:42.064 --> 25:45.332
Excuse me, Miss McFarland?

25:45.334 --> 25:48.302
Actually, it's Conrad,
I changed it, yeah.

25:48.304 --> 25:51.537
So, did you know
Stella Bakanowski?

25:51.539 --> 25:52.642
Stella?

25:55.344 --> 25:57.444
That was her name?

25:57.446 --> 25:59.446
I'll take that as a no.

25:59.448 --> 26:04.083
Can you tell me anything
about your neighbor?

26:04.085 --> 26:07.623
Did you ever see her drinking,
taking narcotics?

26:09.557 --> 26:15.661
I've only been here for
a few days, but she cried a lot.

26:15.663 --> 26:19.365
Literally, all the time.

26:19.367 --> 26:22.535
Well, I always say
there's two kinds of women

26:22.537 --> 26:26.605
in this world, the kind who
cry about their problems

26:26.607 --> 26:29.476
and the kind who do
something about 'em.

26:36.584 --> 26:43.390
Well, call us if you think
of anything you wanna add.

26:43.392 --> 26:44.623
Thanks.

26:44.625 --> 26:46.592
Seriously, guys?

26:48.497 --> 26:50.397
Whoo, whoa, whoa.

26:50.399 --> 26:53.399
Oh, it's, it's okay,
I live upstairs in 212.

26:53.401 --> 26:57.070
Yeah, sorry,
once the police are done,

26:57.072 --> 26:58.505
I'll be happy to escort
you up to your apartment

26:58.507 --> 27:00.172
to get your essentials.

27:00.174 --> 27:02.342
Essentials?

27:02.344 --> 27:05.746
Yeah, I mean, we've gotta fumigate
the deceased's apartment.

27:05.748 --> 27:08.448
We're deeming it an
immediate health hazard,

27:08.450 --> 27:10.417
which means we've gotta get both

27:10.419 --> 27:12.753
neighboring apartments vacated.

27:12.755 --> 27:16.422
Isn't there someone you
could stay with tonight?

27:16.424 --> 27:18.728
A friend, boyfriend?

27:42.284 --> 27:45.217
Ready to order, darling?

27:45.219 --> 27:48.056
I think I might just have
coffee, if that's okay?

27:49.458 --> 27:51.457
It's kinda late.

27:51.459 --> 27:52.691
What's the matter,
you had a fight

27:52.693 --> 27:53.695
with your old man or somethin'?

27:55.096 --> 27:57.397
Uh, something like that.

27:57.399 --> 28:00.833
Well, I'll tell ya,
I think you might be surprised

28:00.835 --> 28:02.334
at how quick a good
steak'll change

28:02.336 --> 28:03.338
a man's attitude towards ya.

28:05.473 --> 28:07.841
Yeah well, apparently,
I can't cook worth a damn,

28:07.843 --> 28:10.412
so, there's that.

28:12.581 --> 28:15.251
And that's why Jesus
invented the microwave.

28:18.487 --> 28:19.421
That'll be $1.50.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.880
You've omitted a contact

28:46.882 --> 28:50.753
for them on your references,
why is that?

28:52.720 --> 28:59.561
So, other than that,
the only contactable references

29:00.796 --> 29:03.833
are for waitressing,
is that right?

29:07.201 --> 29:08.200
You're a waitress?

29:47.375 --> 29:48.777
Hey, Jennifer!

29:49.944 --> 29:51.945
I can't hear you.

29:51.947 --> 29:53.913
Hey Jennifer, it's me.

29:53.915 --> 29:55.849
How's it goin'?

29:55.851 --> 30:00.489
Well uh, you know,
it's kinda, you know.

30:46.634 --> 30:48.270
Can I borrow this, Tina?

30:57.011 --> 30:58.280
I'm sorry, Stella.

31:37.753 --> 31:38.788
Ow!

31:40.956 --> 31:42.291
Whoa.

31:48.796 --> 31:53.501
I look gorgeous.

34:00.862 --> 34:02.131
What do you think, Tina?

34:05.033 --> 34:07.069
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

34:19.647 --> 34:20.681
Hey.

34:33.060 --> 34:34.496
Here we go.

35:20.575 --> 35:23.542
Hey Terry, I'm kind of in a...

35:23.544 --> 35:25.914
Jesus, Jenny,
you look like cat shit.

35:27.248 --> 35:29.915
What do you want, Boyd?

35:29.917 --> 35:33.021
I wanna come in,
what do you think I want?

35:39.527 --> 35:42.027
You poppin' up in
the system, that's a,

35:42.029 --> 35:44.730
that's not a good
way to stay hid.

35:44.732 --> 35:47.502
You still can't park a car on
your own, I see.

35:50.805 --> 35:56.645
Well don't worry about it,
I'll take care of it, as usual.

36:00.614 --> 36:01.915
I appreciate it.

36:01.917 --> 36:03.616
You see...

36:03.618 --> 36:05.087
I don't think that
you do, Jenny.

36:10.792 --> 36:14.797
- Listen.
- No, you listen, okay?

36:16.564 --> 36:19.667
'Cause I don't think
that you appreciate

36:21.102 --> 36:25.772
the lengths that I have gone to,

36:25.774 --> 36:29.545
and that I continue to go to

36:31.078 --> 36:35.080
to make sure you don't
end up drunk and alone

36:35.082 --> 36:37.783
like your goddamn crazy mother.

36:42.957 --> 36:45.158
Stop it, please.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.025
Now don't you...

36:47.027 --> 36:48.196
Howdy, neighbor.

36:51.632 --> 36:53.167
Is there a problem, officer?

36:54.234 --> 36:56.137
No, no problem.

36:57.672 --> 36:59.074
Just a routine check is all.

37:06.848 --> 37:08.683
I brought you
some turtle chow.

37:10.618 --> 37:13.118
Good thing that guy
left when he did.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.157
Been workin' out,
and drinkin' my milk.

37:28.736 --> 37:30.236
All right,
these are too small,

37:30.238 --> 37:32.772
I'm gonna get some
new ones of these.

37:32.774 --> 37:38.580
Oh, okay, oh God, new glasses
too, is what I really need.

37:40.247 --> 37:43.952
That's the key.
That's the key.

37:45.853 --> 37:47.386
All right, this is good here.

37:47.388 --> 37:51.223
Got that, and let that,
no, why don't,

37:51.225 --> 37:55.862
you over there, you here, done.

37:56.864 --> 37:59.431
Come in.

38:01.002 --> 38:02.171
It's open.

38:07.676 --> 38:08.377
Hey.

38:09.944 --> 38:11.279
Got any of that milk left?

38:15.950 --> 38:18.187
Here you go,
this should be perfect.

38:19.988 --> 38:21.323
Hmm.

38:27.161 --> 38:29.163
I'm sorry for
being rude to you.

38:30.964 --> 38:32.765
I really appreciate
what you did up there.

38:32.767 --> 38:35.333
Oh, don't mention it.

38:35.335 --> 38:39.105
So, um, anyway,
I made these cookies.

38:39.107 --> 38:41.107
These are for me?

38:41.109 --> 38:43.141
This is crazy, that's so
nice of you, this is really...

38:47.181 --> 38:50.183
- Um...
- That's good, it was really good.

38:50.185 --> 38:51.350
I'm sorry.

38:51.352 --> 38:52.784
Oh no, no, no.

38:52.786 --> 38:54.256
Cooking's not really my thing.

38:56.290 --> 38:59.725
Boyd always used to say, thank
God for the f'in microwave.

38:59.727 --> 39:02.361
Hey, speaking
of Boyd, I was curious,

39:02.363 --> 39:05.732
what uh,
what's the story with him?

39:10.772 --> 39:14.810
Hey, how are nosy neighbors
like chili peppers?

39:16.977 --> 39:18.076
How?

39:18.078 --> 39:20.179
They jalapeno your business!

39:23.785 --> 39:25.784
I'm sorry to pry,
I was just curious though,

39:25.786 --> 39:28.254
because it just seems like,
how would you...

39:28.256 --> 39:31.324
He pulled me over
for speeding

39:31.326 --> 39:34.527
on my 19th birthday, actually.

39:34.529 --> 39:39.364
Um, and he said that
he would tear up the ticket

39:39.366 --> 39:41.967
if I agreed to go out with him.

39:41.969 --> 39:43.071
What?

39:46.174 --> 39:50.179
Yep, but he was really
handsome in his uniform,

39:51.212 --> 39:52.715
and charming.

39:55.517 --> 39:59.020
And then, one day,
he just flipped, you know?

40:02.189 --> 40:04.125
He just became a totally
different person.

40:08.562 --> 40:12.397
When I was a kid,
my dad wasn't around much.

40:12.399 --> 40:16.835
But when he was,
he was just mean.

40:16.837 --> 40:22.975
And uh, my mother just,
uh, by the time she left,

40:22.977 --> 40:25.513
all of her dreams
were, were gone.

40:27.181 --> 40:29.281
What happened to her?

40:29.283 --> 40:31.817
She drank herself to death,

40:31.819 --> 40:33.855
before I even got
out of high school.

40:35.823 --> 40:37.156
That's really awful.

40:37.158 --> 40:39.826
The point is,
even though my dad

40:39.828 --> 40:41.861
wasn't around
to hurt her anymore,

40:41.863 --> 40:45.964
she carried on like,
like he was still there.

40:45.966 --> 40:48.469
She just tore herself apart.

40:52.006 --> 40:56.542
So, hey, that, um,

40:56.544 --> 40:59.181
the turtle you gave me,
that was really sweet.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.183
Thought you needed a friend.

41:04.919 --> 41:06.187
Well, now I have two.

41:08.189 --> 41:11.056
Well, most people think of
turtles as slow and vulnerable

41:11.058 --> 41:13.558
but the thing about turtles,
they're stronger

41:13.560 --> 41:15.830
than people ever
give 'em credit for.

41:16.997 --> 41:18.399
They can weather a storm.

41:21.002 --> 41:22.868
Why'd you name her Tina?

41:22.870 --> 41:26.404
Oh, Ike and Tina Turtle,
remember them?

41:26.406 --> 41:31.009
Ike and Tina Turtle, great
group, way back in the 60s.

41:31.011 --> 41:32.411
That's really clever.

41:32.413 --> 41:34.082
Tina ended up on top,
you know.

41:35.382 --> 41:38.085
And Ike, nobody cares.

41:40.355 --> 41:43.192
- To weathering the storm.
- To weathering the storm.

46:01.582 --> 46:04.650
Hello, hey.

46:04.652 --> 46:07.152
This better be good, honey,
I've got the QVC on.

46:07.154 --> 46:08.853
I need you to call
an exterminator.

46:08.855 --> 46:10.823
And just what in the heck for?

46:10.825 --> 46:13.591
The city already fumigated
the bejesus out of this place.

46:13.593 --> 46:15.627
I'll probably get
the freakin' cancer

46:15.629 --> 46:18.297
from the damn chemicals
they squirted all over up there.

46:18.299 --> 46:20.165
Yeah I know, I just think
that some of the bugs

46:20.167 --> 46:21.766
or something from Stella's house

46:21.768 --> 46:23.801
have made their way
into my place and...

46:23.803 --> 46:26.404
Look, this ain't
none of my business,

46:26.406 --> 46:28.641
but you may want
to stop donating cash

46:28.643 --> 46:30.576
to old Fuzzy's rent fund.

46:30.578 --> 46:32.710
I don't think there's a lot
of quality control going on

46:32.712 --> 46:34.846
up there in Camp Woodstock.

46:34.848 --> 46:38.183
I'm not on drugs, if that's
what you're implying, okay?

46:38.185 --> 46:40.386
Like I said, it ain't
none of my business.

46:40.388 --> 46:42.757
Look, all right, you see this?

46:44.424 --> 46:46.294
I'm not making this shit up.

46:48.930 --> 46:51.196
Now I know that you have
a legal responsibility

46:51.198 --> 46:53.199
- to your tenants...
- All right, all right,

46:53.201 --> 46:55.833
all right, don't get all
Better Business Bureau on me.

46:55.835 --> 46:57.435
I'll get you a damn exterminator

46:57.437 --> 46:58.837
tomorrow morning, how's that?

46:58.839 --> 46:59.904
Why not tonight?

46:59.906 --> 47:01.839
No, I, I need to sleep,
you don't understand. I...

47:01.841 --> 47:03.908
It is midnight, honey.

47:03.910 --> 47:05.611
Do you really think
that there's an emergency

47:05.613 --> 47:07.946
9-1-1 for ladybug attacks?

47:07.948 --> 47:11.552
I said I will call tomorrow,
I will call tomorrow!

47:15.855 --> 47:18.290
Dude, I like your turtle.

47:18.292 --> 47:21.596
It's not my turtle,
I'm just turtle sitting.

47:23.397 --> 47:24.862
I'm sorry ma'am,

47:24.864 --> 47:28.234
I'm not seeing any
insect activity.

47:28.236 --> 47:29.571
Wait, what do you mean?

47:31.471 --> 47:33.741
I mean you don't
have bugs, at all.

47:35.576 --> 47:38.978
No, that's not right,
you need to check again.

47:38.980 --> 47:41.846
Ma'am, I did
a 16 point inspection,

47:41.848 --> 47:44.218
didn't find so much
as a dead spider.

47:48.288 --> 47:49.890
I know someone you can call.

47:52.359 --> 47:53.394
They helped me.

47:58.366 --> 47:59.964
Get out.

47:59.966 --> 48:01.268
Get out!

48:31.299 --> 48:32.300
Oh, damn it.

48:43.044 --> 48:44.246
Oh, shit!

48:47.314 --> 48:48.547
Shit!

48:48.549 --> 48:50.919
18th floor.

48:59.460 --> 49:00.725
Tell Polycor I don't care

49:00.727 --> 49:02.627
what their initiated
protocols are.

49:02.629 --> 49:03.995
We have a strict
90 day turnaround

49:03.997 --> 49:05.797
indemnification on this deal.

49:05.799 --> 49:08.702
Okay, China does not want...
tell me you understand this!

49:09.837 --> 49:11.502
Put Gil on the phone.

49:11.504 --> 49:13.374
Sir,
your interview is here.

49:17.678 --> 49:18.680
Yo.

49:32.625 --> 49:34.493
Hi,
I'm Jennifer Conrad.

49:34.495 --> 49:36.297
I'm, James Tran.

49:37.598 --> 49:38.967
Actually, um...

49:43.904 --> 49:46.605
I thought that I was
meeting with Brenda.

49:46.607 --> 49:48.406
You'll be meeting
with the both of us actually.

49:48.408 --> 49:50.375
Brenda's on a call
with one of our Chinese clients,

49:50.377 --> 49:51.046
she'll be here shortly.

49:52.078 --> 49:53.314
Oh, okay.

49:58.419 --> 49:59.988
Are you okay, Miss Conrad?

50:02.422 --> 50:06.861
I haven't been sleeping very
well, but I'm fine, thank you.

50:11.165 --> 50:14.602
So, uh, how long have
you known Brenda exactly?

50:16.636 --> 50:18.904
We went
to high school together.

50:18.906 --> 50:20.906
And which high school...

50:20.908 --> 50:22.676
China's a go,
hey, Jenny, sorry I'm late.

50:25.044 --> 50:26.080
Hey, Brenda.

50:28.047 --> 50:30.114
So, you're the friend
that Brenda

50:30.116 --> 50:34.553
decided to put in
a personal recommendation for.

50:34.555 --> 50:35.589
Yeah.

50:37.190 --> 50:38.757
Well, looks like
we're all done here.

50:38.759 --> 50:39.991
We appreciate you coming in.

50:39.993 --> 50:41.363
- Look...
- Thank you.

50:56.477 --> 50:59.814
Brenda, close the door.

51:36.517 --> 51:37.518
Asshole!

51:43.524 --> 51:45.924
I mean, could it be
some kind of rash then?

51:45.926 --> 51:47.926
No, I mean I doubt it.

51:47.928 --> 51:50.828
I mean, if it were a rash,
we'd see some concentration

51:50.830 --> 51:52.864
in a specific area
before the spreading.

51:52.866 --> 51:55.933
But these are everywhere.

51:55.935 --> 51:57.703
There was
a pretty bad situation

51:57.705 --> 51:59.504
with my next door
neighbor recently

51:59.506 --> 52:01.105
and there's a pretty good chance
that she had bed bugs.

52:01.107 --> 52:04.208
These are definitely
not from any bed bugs.

52:04.210 --> 52:06.545
I mean, they're just too big.

52:06.547 --> 52:09.547
And beyond that,
they seem very irritated.

52:09.549 --> 52:11.616
I can tell you've been
scratching at them.

52:11.618 --> 52:14.122
They only happen when
I'm asleep, so...

52:15.922 --> 52:18.123
I mean, I keep waking up
and I have new ones.

52:18.125 --> 52:19.625
Okay, you know what,
hold on a second, okay.

52:19.627 --> 52:21.926
I'll take another look.

52:21.928 --> 52:23.661
Thank you.

52:23.663 --> 52:25.696
Let me see 'em again.

52:25.698 --> 52:29.036
And, let me do it, okay, 'cause
I don't want you scratching.

52:30.571 --> 52:31.569
Ouch.

52:31.571 --> 52:32.573
It's okay.

52:35.743 --> 52:41.647
Wow, do you know if your
neighbor had any animal vermin?

52:41.649 --> 52:43.047
Like mice maybe?

52:43.049 --> 52:45.616
I'm not, I, I don't know.

52:45.618 --> 52:47.719
Why?

52:47.721 --> 52:50.589
Well, it could be because
of all of your scratching,

52:50.591 --> 52:53.759
but these wounds look
very ragged, I mean,

52:53.761 --> 52:56.594
the impressions
around the very edges

52:56.596 --> 52:59.598
kinda seem like they
were caused by...

52:59.600 --> 53:00.802
What?

53:02.937 --> 53:04.770
Teeth.

53:36.937 --> 53:38.739
Jennifer...

53:43.944 --> 53:45.046
Jennifer...

53:50.718 --> 53:53.721
Jennifer...

53:56.890 --> 54:00.127
Jennifer...

57:01.841 --> 57:04.177
Jesus, Terry!

57:05.212 --> 57:06.978
Jennifer?

57:06.980 --> 57:09.380
What are you doing in here?

57:09.382 --> 57:10.417
I need you to help me.

57:13.553 --> 57:15.222
What are you talking about?

57:17.223 --> 57:21.228
It came from inside of here,
the thing that ate Stella.

57:23.897 --> 57:26.330
Now it's eating me.

57:26.332 --> 57:30.868
She knew, she knew
that it would never stop,

57:30.870 --> 57:33.471
that's why she shot herself.

57:33.473 --> 57:36.473
I wanna help you, I really do.

57:36.475 --> 57:38.976
But in order to do that,
we have to talk about

57:38.978 --> 57:43.181
what's really going
on here, okay?

57:43.183 --> 57:46.551
You knew, you knew
about the drawings in her wall

57:46.553 --> 57:48.453
and you hid them.

57:48.455 --> 57:50.522
I didn't hide
anything, Jennifer.

57:50.524 --> 57:51.957
You covered
them up,

57:51.959 --> 57:53.190
why didn't you just tell me?

57:53.192 --> 57:55.060
I work in here, I can't...

57:55.062 --> 57:57.165
I don't wanna look
at those things.

58:01.968 --> 58:04.969
Look, Stella was very disturbed.

58:04.971 --> 58:07.538
- No.
- She was.

58:07.540 --> 58:09.341
No, Terry, you
listen to me, okay?

58:09.343 --> 58:11.475
And, sometimes,
sometimes when people are

58:11.477 --> 58:13.478
so used to being hurt...

58:13.480 --> 58:18.315
What you,
you think I did this?

58:18.317 --> 58:21.888
You, you think, you.

58:23.656 --> 58:25.924
Look, okay, I know
how this looks and I,

58:25.926 --> 58:28.926
I know that you must think
I'm crazy, but I'm not.

58:28.928 --> 58:32.630
I know the answer's
in here somewhere, I just,

58:32.632 --> 58:36.000
I just need,
I just need a minute, okay?

58:36.002 --> 58:40.975
Just, just go, okay?

58:42.375 --> 58:45.944
You think something in here
will help you?

58:45.946 --> 58:50.382
I mean, there's not
much left, but, okay,

58:50.384 --> 58:53.484
okay, you want to,
all right, that's fine.

58:53.486 --> 58:56.022
Look around, do what
you're gonna do, okay?

58:57.189 --> 58:58.924
But be quiet, all right.

58:58.926 --> 59:00.158
If Claudette finds out
you've been in here,

59:00.160 --> 59:02.060
I could lose my job, all right?

59:02.062 --> 59:05.496
And no more climbin'
in and out of windows, got it?

59:05.498 --> 59:07.966
Okay.

59:07.968 --> 59:12.237
Now here's Stella's keys,
lock up after you go.

59:12.239 --> 59:14.239
I'm gonna board
the window back up

59:14.241 --> 59:17.475
so Claudette doesn't
know you've been here.

59:17.477 --> 59:23.517
You be careful,
okay, okay?

59:24.984 --> 59:25.986
Thanks, Terry.

59:32.359 --> 59:33.393
All right.

59:40.267 --> 59:41.602
Come on, Stella.

59:56.649 --> 59:59.252
What happened to you, Stella?

01:00:39.259 --> 01:00:41.228
Enough.

01:02:15.622 --> 01:02:17.621
You gotta
be kiddin' me.

01:02:17.623 --> 01:02:19.757
What,
think it's cute.

01:02:19.759 --> 01:02:21.391
Well, take it down.

01:02:21.393 --> 01:02:24.161
Folk'll think a couple
queers live here.

01:02:24.163 --> 01:02:26.263
All right,
then I'll tell 'em

01:02:26.265 --> 01:02:27.565
that you put it up.

01:02:27.567 --> 01:02:29.236
Hey, what'd you
just say to me?

01:02:31.605 --> 01:02:33.170
- Um.
- Hm?

01:02:33.172 --> 01:02:36.174
Um, I like it, I'm sorry.

01:02:36.176 --> 01:02:38.245
Do you mind
if we keep it, please?

01:02:49.189 --> 01:02:50.324
Grab something.

01:02:58.864 --> 01:03:01.267
Well, well,
look what we've got here.

01:03:03.236 --> 01:03:06.574
Little miss independent,
cold busted sneaking away.

01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:10.841
Jesus Jen, I thought you
was a burglar, I almost shot you

01:03:10.843 --> 01:03:12.512
as dead
as fried chicken, girl.

01:03:18.484 --> 01:03:23.289
Well, go on, go ahead.

01:03:25.392 --> 01:03:27.257
What?

01:03:27.259 --> 01:03:28.792
Ask if you can come back,

01:03:28.794 --> 01:03:30.230
that's what
you're here for, ain't it?

01:03:33.232 --> 01:03:35.833
That's not why I'm here.

01:03:35.835 --> 01:03:39.874
Okay, well then,
why is it you're here, Jenny?

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:44.812
Uh...

01:03:49.248 --> 01:03:51.248
I came for my sign.

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:52.486
You came....

01:03:58.257 --> 01:03:59.489
Is that right?

01:03:59.491 --> 01:04:03.261
You drove, middle of the night,

01:04:03.263 --> 01:04:05.629
put on five pounds of makeup,

01:04:05.631 --> 01:04:07.534
in that rattlin'
piece of shit car,

01:04:11.303 --> 01:04:14.474
for this little hunk of junk?

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:19.779
Oh, really?

01:04:27.386 --> 01:04:31.321
Oh you want this, is that right?

01:04:31.323 --> 01:04:33.293
Well, this is mine
right now, Jenny.

01:04:35.395 --> 01:04:38.862
It's not yours, nothin's
yours unless I give it to you.

01:04:38.864 --> 01:04:41.267
Unless I give it to you.

01:04:42.402 --> 01:04:44.271
You remember that.

01:04:57.584 --> 01:04:58.618
You'll be back.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:03.290
Except, next time, you're
gonna have to ask real nice,

01:05:04.823 --> 01:05:06.357
you can count on it.

01:05:15.368 --> 01:05:17.701
All dolled up
and just getting home,

01:05:17.703 --> 01:05:19.372
now why am I not surprised?

01:05:20.939 --> 01:05:23.074
Well, I am sure
your parole officer'll

01:05:23.076 --> 01:05:25.375
be very interested
to hear about this.

01:05:25.377 --> 01:05:27.847
Well, that got your attention,
didn't it?

01:05:28.948 --> 01:05:31.882
I don't have a parole officer,

01:05:31.884 --> 01:05:36.420
and I'm not on drugs, all right?

01:05:36.422 --> 01:05:38.656
That policeman,
who's been filling your head

01:05:38.658 --> 01:05:40.891
with all this bullshit,

01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:43.594
he's my ex-husband
and he's doing everything he can

01:05:43.596 --> 01:05:46.567
to get me to give up and go
back to being his punching bag.

01:05:48.468 --> 01:05:52.306
And the best part of it is,
now he's got you helping him,

01:05:53.506 --> 01:05:55.473
only you're too goddamn stupid

01:05:55.475 --> 01:05:57.708
to figure it out for yourself.

01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:59.944
But he gave me this pamphlet.

01:05:59.946 --> 01:06:01.578
Why don't you roll it up

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.383
and stick it up
your ass, Claudette?

01:06:21.433 --> 01:06:22.502
Goddamn hippies.

01:06:34.913 --> 01:06:36.816
Jennifer, are you okay?

01:06:39.085 --> 01:06:40.917
Jennifer?

01:06:40.919 --> 01:06:43.855
I heard you and Claudette
arguing earlier.

01:06:43.857 --> 01:06:46.093
Unfortunately, I think
the whole complex did.

01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:53.433
Jennifer?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.902
All right, let me know
if you need anything.

01:06:57.904 --> 01:07:00.107
I'll come back later.

01:07:10.517 --> 01:07:13.551
Goddammit!

01:09:11.938 --> 01:09:14.675
There was this
beautiful jewelry box,

01:09:16.075 --> 01:09:19.112
no one was around,
I just took it.

01:09:20.912 --> 01:09:23.116
Why can't I stop taking things?

01:10:58.077 --> 01:11:01.945
Woe are they
who shall not rest.

01:11:01.947 --> 01:11:05.950
Woe to those in Jedak's nest.

01:11:05.952 --> 01:11:10.056
Beware of sleep,
for when you wake

01:11:12.759 --> 01:11:15.194
lost what flesh it came to take.

01:11:17.929 --> 01:11:21.966
The thing that eats
and never dies,

01:11:21.968 --> 01:11:26.436
you only catch it by the eyes.

01:11:26.438 --> 01:11:29.375
'Til you're dead,
it will not cease.

01:11:32.912 --> 01:11:36.717
Take my Jedak, give me peace.

01:12:51.389 --> 01:12:53.392
You idiot.

01:13:01.533 --> 01:13:02.768
Oh, God.

01:13:54.987 --> 01:13:59.890
No, no, no!

01:17:00.072 --> 01:17:01.474
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:18:23.188 --> 01:18:27.257
You only catch it by the eyes.

01:18:31.362 --> 01:18:32.398
I got you.

01:18:38.804 --> 01:18:40.169
Jennifer,
Jennifer, Jennifer.

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:42.705
Jennifer, are you okay?

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:45.812
Come to the door.

01:18:48.746 --> 01:18:52.182
Jennifer,
I know you're in there.

01:18:52.184 --> 01:18:54.183
Now open this door,
I can hear you in there.

01:18:55.854 --> 01:18:57.654
I don't know
what's happening in there

01:18:57.656 --> 01:19:00.289
but I don't like it,
and if you don't talk to me

01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:02.594
right now, I'm coming in.

01:19:06.732 --> 01:19:10.103
Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

01:19:10.903 --> 01:19:12.105
You okay?

01:19:13.605 --> 01:19:15.405
Stay there,
I'm gonna get help, okay.

01:19:15.407 --> 01:19:16.276
I'm gonna get some...

01:19:25.317 --> 01:19:26.616
Terry.

01:19:26.618 --> 01:19:29.453
What, Jennifer, what is it?

01:19:31.422 --> 01:19:32.823
Jennifer, you have
to get some help.

01:19:32.825 --> 01:19:35.424
This is, this is crazy, okay?

01:19:35.426 --> 01:19:37.593
And it's my fault,
and I'm sorry.

01:19:37.595 --> 01:19:40.830
But we have to get you
some help right now, okay?

01:19:40.832 --> 01:19:44.500
Okay, I'm gonna go get an
ambulance right now, Jennifer.

01:19:44.502 --> 01:19:48.504
I have to do something
proactive, okay?

01:19:48.506 --> 01:19:49.606
Stay there!

01:19:49.608 --> 01:19:51.240
No, don't get up!

01:22:09.814 --> 01:22:10.817
Great.

01:22:12.084 --> 01:22:13.450
Come on.

01:22:42.747 --> 01:22:44.416
Oh, oh!

01:26:51.929 --> 01:26:55.066
You like to hurt people,
don't you?

01:26:57.001 --> 01:26:58.670
Well, let's see how you like it.

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:39.075
Thank God
for the fucking microwave.

01:27:50.121 --> 01:27:52.955
I don't know what you are,

01:27:52.957 --> 01:27:56.426
or where the hell you came from,

01:27:56.428 --> 01:27:58.762
but you better listen up.

01:27:58.764 --> 01:28:03.035
Now you can hurt me,
you can take my sleep,

01:28:04.169 --> 01:28:05.971
you can take my sanity,

01:28:07.938 --> 01:28:09.938
you can even kill me.

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:15.411
But you are never, ever,
ever gonna break me!

01:28:15.413 --> 01:28:20.152
So, you and I need to come
to some kind of an agreement,

01:28:21.952 --> 01:28:24.156
or we can just keep going,

01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:28.828
it's your choice.

01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:56.820
Terry, what are you doing?

01:28:56.822 --> 01:28:58.221
I'm just helping.

01:28:58.223 --> 01:29:01.160
You're supposed to be resting.

01:29:03.862 --> 01:29:06.332
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

01:29:07.832 --> 01:29:09.798
It's for the best.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.370
I don't mind stayin'
and helpin' out if you need it.

01:29:14.406 --> 01:29:18.310
You've already done
more than enough, I'm fine.

01:29:19.845 --> 01:29:20.913
All right.

01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:26.348
Oh, oh, oh.

01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:27.950
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

01:29:27.952 --> 01:29:29.421
Chicks dig the scars.

01:29:30.822 --> 01:29:32.158
Get outta here.

01:29:53.944 --> 01:29:55.046
So...

01:30:00.786 --> 01:30:02.121
Happened to your face?

01:30:04.956 --> 01:30:06.325
Thanks for coming.

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.004
Well, go on, ask.

01:30:23.908 --> 01:30:25.411
I wanna come home,

01:30:27.879 --> 01:30:29.180
if you don't mind.

01:30:33.117 --> 01:30:35.051
Yeah, well,
after all this bullshit,

01:30:35.053 --> 01:30:37.790
there's gonna be some fuckin'
rules, that's for sure.

01:30:39.023 --> 01:30:40.492
Yeah, I know.

01:30:42.027 --> 01:30:43.593
Tell you what, you're crazy

01:30:43.595 --> 01:30:45.928
if you think I'm movin'
all this shit back.

01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:50.933
No, I mean, that's my fault,
so I'll finish and...

01:30:50.935 --> 01:30:53.936
I'll finish packing tomorrow
and then I'll talk to Claudette

01:30:53.938 --> 01:30:55.874
about letting me
out of my lease.

01:30:57.908 --> 01:31:00.513
I should be finished
by the end of the week, I think.

01:31:04.282 --> 01:31:06.152
Well, all right.

01:31:07.952 --> 01:31:13.858
I will
see you at home.

01:31:21.332 --> 01:31:22.334
Hey, baby?

01:31:25.103 --> 01:31:26.569
Would you mind taking

01:31:26.571 --> 01:31:30.405
some of my clothes
back with you?

01:31:30.407 --> 01:31:33.109
I thought that maybe
I could stay over a few nights

01:31:33.111 --> 01:31:38.317
until I'm done packing and
things, would that be okay?

01:31:41.653 --> 01:31:45.088
Now, that's what
I like to hear.

01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:46.458
Thanks.

01:33:21.385 --> 01:33:22.420
Jenny!

01:33:27.392 --> 01:33:29.528
Not off to a very
good start, Jenny.

01:33:32.029 --> 01:33:33.364
Don't smell any damn bacon.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.703
Oh,
hope I brought some.

01:33:44.108 --> 01:33:45.141
What the hell?
