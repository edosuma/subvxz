 (gunshot)

00:03.134 --> 00:04.105
(Emily) THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN
IS DEAD.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.636
HIS NAME WAS GORDON MURPHY.

00:05.636 --> 00:08.179
I FOUND THIS ON HIM.
HE KNEW MY MOTHER.

00:08.179 --> 00:09.340
(Aiden, American accent)
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?

00:09.340 --> 00:11.212
WHAT'S HE WANTED FOR?
 KIDNAPPING.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.315
SHOW THIS TO CHARLOTTE. IT'S ONE
OF MY FATHER'S JOURNALS.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.286
OR AT LEAST
MY VERSION OF IT.

00:16.286 --> 00:18.689
THERE IS ONE PERSON I WISH
TO WELCOME INTO THE FOLD--

00:18.689 --> 00:20.351
AMANDA CLARKE.

00:20.351 --> 00:22.053
YOU AND YOUR NEW FAMILY
WERE ALL OVER THE NEWS.

00:22.053 --> 00:24.024
I'M COMMITTED TO OUR CHILD.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.626
I JUST DON'T THINK
I CAN COMMIT TO YOU.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.028
(Kara) It's me.
God, Gordon, please be okay.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.131
I love you.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.306
(Emily) SOME THINK INTUITION
IS A GIFT.

00:35.306 --> 00:38.309
BUT IT CAN BE A CURSE
AS WELL...

00:48.048 --> 00:50.481
A VOICE CALLING
TO US FROM PLACES

00:50.481 --> 00:53.053
THAT ARE
BETTER LEFT UNEXPLORED...

00:55.726 --> 00:59.130
AN ECHO OF MEMORIES
THAT WILL NEVER DIE...

01:02.293 --> 01:05.396
NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY
TO KILL THEM.

01:08.139 --> 01:10.441
SO... (panting)

01:10.441 --> 01:12.573
RECONSIDERED MY APOLOGY?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.475
YOU FOUND MY MOTHER.
 (cell phone beeps)

01:14.475 --> 01:16.807
(female electronic voice)
RECEIVED AT 1:21 A.M.

01:16.807 --> 01:19.510
(Kara) It's me.
Where are you?

01:19.510 --> 01:22.853
Um, some guy claiming to be
a Detective Lasky

01:22.853 --> 01:24.485
came by with a sketch

01:24.485 --> 01:26.117
asking questions.

01:26.117 --> 01:28.289
I know
what I'm supposed to do.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.460
(beeps)

01:29.460 --> 01:30.621
WHAT,
THAT'S YOUR MOTHER'S VOICE?

01:30.621 --> 01:32.293
AND I CHECKED.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.766
DETECTIVE LASKY
DOESN'T EXIST.

01:35.766 --> 01:38.669
WHERE DID YOU GO YESTERDAY,
AIDEN?

01:38.669 --> 01:40.571
HOW DID YOU FIND
THE FLIGHT RECORDER?

01:40.571 --> 01:42.473
I LIFTED A KEY OFF
YOUR WOULD-BE KILLER'S BODY

01:42.473 --> 01:44.335
BEFORE YOU KNOCKED ME OUT.

01:44.335 --> 01:48.209
LOOK, IF THE WOMAN ON THAT
MESSAGE REALLY IS YOUR MOTHER

01:48.209 --> 01:49.340
AND SHE'S AS DEEPLY INVOLVED

01:49.340 --> 01:51.111
WITH THE MAN WHO KILLED
YOUR FATHER AS IT APPEARS,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.314
THE INITIATIVE
ARE GONNA BE ALL OVER HER.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.347
THIS DETECTIVE LASKY
IS PROBABLY ONE OF THEM.

01:56.347 --> 01:57.688
ALL THE MORE REASON
I NEED TO FIND HER.

01:57.688 --> 01:58.849
AND TELL HER WHAT?

01:58.849 --> 02:00.251
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
HOW SHE MIGHT REACT

02:00.251 --> 02:01.592
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT
THAT GORDON'S DEAD?

02:01.592 --> 02:02.753
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

02:02.753 --> 02:04.124
AND IF SHE ASKS ME,

02:04.124 --> 02:05.256
I'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM
TELLING HER WHO DID.

02:05.256 --> 02:06.797
RIGHT, WILL THAT BE BEFORE
OR AFTER YOU TELL HER

02:06.797 --> 02:08.299
WHO YOU REALLY ARE?

02:08.299 --> 02:10.130
OR MAYBE SHE'LL SAVE YOU
THE TROUBLE BY RECOGNIZING YOU.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.862
THINK, EMILY.

02:11.862 --> 02:13.234
THIS WOMAN HAS THE POWER
TO DESTROY

02:13.234 --> 02:14.565
EVERYTHING
YOU CAME HERE TO DO.

02:14.565 --> 02:16.537
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT HER MOTIVES ARE.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.339
THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN
HAD NEARLY 20 YEARS

02:18.339 --> 02:20.471
TO BRAINWASH HER INTO BELIEVING
ANYTHING HE WANTED.

02:20.471 --> 02:23.314
THAT--THAT IS EXACTLY THE POINT
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE.

02:23.314 --> 02:24.645
BEFORE YOU TRACK HER DOWN,

02:24.645 --> 02:26.577
YOU BETTER BE PREPARED
FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.252
EM--

02:31.252 --> 02:33.324
(Victoria)
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

02:33.324 --> 02:34.285
(Conrad) HMM?

02:34.285 --> 02:36.187
BRINGING THE INITIATIVE
BACK INTO OUR LIVES

02:36.187 --> 02:37.688
IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

02:37.688 --> 02:39.230
WELL, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD'VE
THOUGHT OF THAT

02:39.230 --> 02:40.531
BEFORE YOU MADE
THEN BROKE A DEAL

02:40.531 --> 02:43.234
WITH ONE OF THEIR
DEADLIEST ASSASSINS.

02:43.234 --> 02:45.196
AND IT'S NOT AN INVITATION,
IN ANY CASE.

02:45.196 --> 02:46.166
IT'S A SUMMONS.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.838

02:47.838 --> 02:50.341

IN YOUR VOICE?

02:50.341 --> 02:51.502
YES, IT IS.

02:51.502 --> 02:52.843

YOU WILL SCREW THINGS UP

02:52.843 --> 02:55.406

YOUR REPTILIAN HANDS ON.

AH, THAT'S A NECESSARY EVIL,

03:54.735 --> 03:55.906

03:55.906 --> 03:57.838

AND WILL BE AUCTIONED OFF
IF NOT CLAIMED.

08:53.063 --> 08:55.736
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
HE DIED?

08:57.568 --> 09:01.171
BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST
I'M HEARING OF IT.

09:01.171 --> 09:03.574
(inhales deeply)

09:03.574 --> 09:04.745
(clears throat)

09:04.745 --> 09:08.078
UH, LET'S GET BACK TO WORK,
SHALL WE?

09:08.078 --> 09:10.020
(sniffles)

09:10.020 --> 09:11.321
WHY ARE YOU BLOWING UP
MY PHONE, PORTER?

09:11.321 --> 09:12.853
I GAVE YOU YOUR TAKE.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.184
YEAH,
AND I'M GIVING IT BACK.

09:14.184 --> 09:15.155
THE STUFF WE STOLE
THE OTHER NIGHT,

09:15.155 --> 09:16.827
I NEED IT, NOW.

09:16.827 --> 09:18.288
MAYBE YOU DON'T GET
HOW THIS WORKS.

09:18.288 --> 09:19.990
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

09:19.990 --> 09:21.291
BUT THE GUY HAS MY I.D.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.093
HE COMES BY LAST NIGHT,
SAYS HE'S GONNA GO TO THE COPS

09:23.093 --> 09:24.294
IF I DON'T GET HIM
HIS STUFF BACK.

09:24.294 --> 09:25.736
SO WHAT'D YOU DO WITH IT?

09:25.736 --> 09:27.067
(laughs)
YOU LEFT YOUR I.D.?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.198
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY.

09:28.198 --> 09:29.970
I COVERED YOUR ASS.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.902
YOU GOTTA HELP ME.
 LOOK, I CAN'T.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.804
THE GUY WHO SELLS
THE STUFF THAT WE STOLE,

09:33.804 --> 09:35.145
HE'D BREAK OUR LEGS
JUST FOR ASKING.

09:35.145 --> 09:36.607
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.086
NEW FRIEND?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.958
NO.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.794
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.127
I GOT A PROBLEM, JACK.

09:57.127 --> 10:00.070
(sighs)

10:00.070 --> 10:01.371
(Victoria) I WANT YOU TO KNOW

10:01.371 --> 10:05.275
THAT WHATEVER ISSUES YOU AND I
MAY HAVE HAD,

10:05.275 --> 10:07.678
I LOVED YOUR FATHER
VERY MUCH.

10:07.678 --> 10:10.110
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THERE'S MORE TO THAT STORY.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.082
YOU MAY HAVE HAD
MY FATHER FOOLED,

10:12.082 --> 10:14.144
BUT YOU DON'T FOOL ME.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.116
DON'T PISS HER OFF.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.118
NOT YET.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.190
READ HER THE FIRST PASSAGE.

10:20.190 --> 10:22.653
"I'LL NEVER FORGET THE NIGHT
VICTORIA AND I MET.

10:22.653 --> 10:24.024
"NEW YEAR'S EVE,

10:24.024 --> 10:26.026
"1991.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.029
"IN HER EYES,
I SAW KINDNESS AND FIRE

10:29.029 --> 10:31.131
"AND SOMETHING ELSE--

10:31.131 --> 10:35.065
"A DEEP SADNESS
TO MATCH MY OWN.

10:35.065 --> 10:39.139
"IT HAD BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE
I HAD SAID GOOD-BYE TO MY WIFE.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.672
"AND THE PAIN OF THAT LOSS
WAS AS CRIPPLING ON THAT NIGHT

10:41.672 --> 10:45.876
AS IT WAS THE DAY I LAID EYES
ON HER FOR THE LAST TIME."

10:50.320 --> 10:52.382
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE,
SHALL WE? HOW MUCH?

10:52.382 --> 10:54.284
HUH?

10:54.284 --> 10:57.087
FOR THE JOURNAL. HOW MUCH?

10:57.087 --> 10:58.328
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.290
THEN PRAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:00.290 --> 11:02.662
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT MY MOTHER.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.836
READ HER THE NEXT PASSAGE.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.167
"THE ONLY PERSON TO WHOM

11:07.167 --> 11:09.199
"I EVER CONFIDED THE TRUTH
ABOUT KARA

11:09.199 --> 11:12.272
WAS VICTORIA."

11:12.272 --> 11:14.074
WHAT TRUTH
IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

11:14.074 --> 11:16.206
ALL I KNOW
IS WHAT HE TOLD ME.

11:16.206 --> 11:18.308
THAT YOUR MOTHER DIED
IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION

11:18.308 --> 11:21.251
WHEN YOU WERE
A VERY LITTLE GIRL.

11:21.251 --> 11:22.212
PERHAPS

11:22.212 --> 11:25.385
A SIMILAR FATE
AWAITS YOU.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.757
DID YOU...

11:26.757 --> 11:27.918
...MEET HER?

11:27.918 --> 11:29.790
NO, AND IF YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO FALL PREY

11:29.790 --> 11:33.223
TO YOUR EMOTIONAL EXTORTION,
YOU ARE SORELY MISTAKEN.

11:33.223 --> 11:35.866
TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY MOTHER,

11:35.866 --> 11:37.998
AND I WILL GIVE YOU
THIS JOURNAL.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.830
ALL I CAN TELL YOU

11:39.830 --> 11:41.171
IS THAT YOUR MOTHER

11:41.171 --> 11:43.173
WAS THE SOURCE
OF ALL OF DAVID'S PAIN.

11:43.173 --> 11:44.935
NOW... (inhales deeply)

11:44.935 --> 11:46.737
IF YOU DON'T CARE
TO SHARE HIS WRITINGS,

11:46.737 --> 11:48.278
THAT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE.

11:48.278 --> 11:49.239
BUT YOU'RE FAMILY NOW.

11:49.239 --> 11:50.410
AND IT'S MY HOPE

11:50.410 --> 11:52.382
THAT ONE DAY
YOU WILL SHARE THEM,

11:52.382 --> 11:55.215
IF NOT OUT OF RESPECT FOR ME,
OUT OF LOVE FOR YOUR FATHER.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.787
(Charlotte) MOM.

11:56.787 --> 11:59.449
AMANDA. WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:59.449 --> 12:01.091
WELL,

12:01.091 --> 12:03.493
WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
AMANDA'S BABY SHOWER.

12:03.493 --> 12:05.355
WHAT BABY SHOWER?

12:05.355 --> 12:06.857
WELL, THE ONE THAT WE'RE
THROWING FOR HER TOMORROW.

12:06.857 --> 12:08.859
IT'S IMPROMPTU, I KNOW,

12:08.859 --> 12:10.100
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A FUN WAY

12:10.100 --> 12:11.461
FOR YOU TO CELEBRATE
BEING AN AUNT.

12:11.461 --> 12:13.463
SAY YES.
 AND I WOULD LOVE
TO WELCOME...

12:13.463 --> 12:14.965
WE NEED ANOTHER PASS
AT HER.

12:14.965 --> 12:16.436
AMANDA INTO
MY PUBLIC CIRCLE.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.038
(Amanda) YES.

12:18.038 --> 12:21.772
I FEEL LIKE THE LUCKIEST GIRL
IN THE WORLD.

12:26.176 --> 12:27.277
(clicks keyboard keys)

12:29.079 --> 12:30.250
(whooshes)

12:33.383 --> 12:35.125
(clicking calculator keys)

12:35.125 --> 12:36.957
(whoosh)

12:36.957 --> 12:38.428
(continues clicking keys)

12:40.130 --> 12:41.431
(exhales)

12:41.431 --> 12:43.333
(Ashley) DANIEL.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.795
I THOUGHT YOU WENT HOME.

12:44.795 --> 12:46.436
I THOUGHT YOU DID, TOO.

12:46.436 --> 12:48.298
WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

12:48.298 --> 12:51.001
FINAL DETAILS
ON THE DUBAI TELECONFERENCE

12:51.001 --> 12:52.242
IN THE MORNING.

12:52.242 --> 12:53.403
YOU?

12:53.403 --> 12:54.374
SAME.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.046
UH, MY LAPTOP FROZE.

12:56.046 --> 12:58.348
I WAS JUST...
USING MY DAD'S COMPUTER

12:58.348 --> 13:00.881
TO PRINT THESE OUT
FOR THE CALL.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.813
(clicks latches)

13:02.813 --> 13:04.915
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.

13:04.915 --> 13:07.017
CAN WE JUST BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER?

13:07.017 --> 13:08.788
HAVEN'T WE ALWAYS BEEN?

13:08.788 --> 13:09.960
(sighs)

13:09.960 --> 13:11.421
I'M WORRIED.

13:11.421 --> 13:13.293
EVER SINCE YOU SHARED YOUR
SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE RANSOM,

13:13.293 --> 13:17.227
I KEEP THINKING, IF CONRAD WERE
ENGAGED IN SOME IMPROPRIETY,

13:17.227 --> 13:18.528
COULDN'T WE ALL
BE IMPLICATED?

13:18.528 --> 13:20.570
NOT IF GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF IT FIRST.

13:20.570 --> 13:23.003
AND WHATEVER HE'S DONE,
I PROMISE,

13:23.003 --> 13:25.005
HE'S GONNA BE TAKING
SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

13:25.005 --> 13:28.578
AND YOU WOULD DO THAT,
TURN ON YOUR OWN FATHER?

13:28.578 --> 13:31.281
WHAT, YOU THINK HE WOULDN'T DO
THE SAME TO ME OR CHARLOTTE

13:31.281 --> 13:32.983
OR YOU?

13:42.292 --> 13:44.594
HEY, HEY, HEY. WE'RE--
WE'RE CLOSED.

13:44.594 --> 13:47.457
UM, THERE'S--THERE'S
A BED-AND-BREAKFAST

13:47.457 --> 13:50.130
ABOUT 20 MILES EAST...

13:50.130 --> 13:51.431
OH, YOU AGAIN.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.933
ODD TIME TO BE
CLOSING UP SHOP.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.935
THE SEASON'S
JUST GETTING STARTED.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.266
WHAT'S ODD IS,
YOU WERE AN AMERICAN

13:56.266 --> 13:57.507
THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE.

13:57.507 --> 14:00.540
I WORK FOR THE FBI.
DEEP COVER, SAME AS GORDON.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.243
I KNOW HIS FEELINGS FOR YOU

14:03.243 --> 14:05.215
RAN BEYOND
PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION.

14:05.215 --> 14:06.376
WHERE IS HE?

14:06.376 --> 14:07.347
HIS LAST COMMUNIQUE INDICATED

14:07.347 --> 14:08.518
HIS IDENTITY
HAD BEEN COMPROMISED.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.850
HIS DIRECT ORDERS
WERE TO RETURN HERE.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.352
WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.483
THE PEOPLE
GORDON WAS INFILTRATING

14:13.483 --> 14:15.455
ARE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.586
YOU NEED TO TELL ME
WHATEVER YOU KNOW

14:16.586 --> 14:18.388
ABOUT WHOEVER
HE'S BEEN IN CONTACT WITH.

14:18.388 --> 14:21.461
I'M GONNA STICK TO THE PLAN,
HIS PLAN.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.493
GOOD-BYE.

14:23.493 --> 14:26.897
SORRY, MS. CLARKE.

14:26.897 --> 14:29.139
BUT I CANNOT LET YOU DO THAT.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.383
YOU'RE AWFULLY QUIET
THIS MORNING.

14:48.258 --> 14:50.460
I JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT,

14:50.460 --> 14:53.663
ABOUT BEING IMPLICATED
IN WHAT MY FATHER'S DONE.

14:53.663 --> 14:57.467
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU
GET DRAGGED INTO IT.

14:57.467 --> 14:58.628
INTO WHAT?

14:58.628 --> 15:01.201
MY PARENTS,
THEY'VE DESTROY PEOPLE.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.133
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.435
I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IMAGINATION.

15:07.337 --> 15:09.239
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

15:09.239 --> 15:10.941
LOOK, THE KIDNAPPING,

15:10.941 --> 15:12.582
IT WASN'T REAL.

15:12.582 --> 15:14.644
THE MONEY MY FATHER
PRETENDED TO PAY IN RANSOM

15:14.644 --> 15:16.516
WAS ACTUALLY USED
TO INFLATE INVESTOR RETURNS.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.989
BUT THAT COULD BRING DOWN
THE ENTIRE COMPANY.

15:18.989 --> 15:20.690
YOU GOTTA TRUST ME.

15:20.690 --> 15:22.222
I'VE GOT A PLAN.

15:25.455 --> 15:28.628
(cell phone buzzes)

15:30.260 --> 15:32.332
(buzz)

15:32.332 --> 15:34.434
ARE YOU GONNA GET THAT?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.966
UH...
 (beeps)

15:35.966 --> 15:37.307
NO.

15:37.307 --> 15:39.139
THE MAN'S CALLED ME
THREE TIMES TODAY

15:39.139 --> 15:42.472
TO CONFIRM THE EASTERN EXPOSURE
ON HIS PALM BEACH HOTEL SUITE.

15:43.713 --> 15:47.077
YOU SHOULD GET DRESSED.
WE'RE LATE.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.182
WHAT IS THIS?

15:52.182 --> 15:53.653
IT'S PROOF THAT VICTORIA
KNEW MY MOTHER.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.525
SHE VISITED HER
IN THE HOSPITAL.

15:55.525 --> 15:57.327
IT'S SIGNED CHARLOTTE CLARKE.

15:57.327 --> 15:58.588
WHY WOULD VICTORIA ADMIT

15:58.588 --> 16:00.630
TO SIGNING IN
UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME?

16:00.630 --> 16:03.063
LEAVE THAT TO ME.
I'LL DO THE TALKING.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.734
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M UP FOR THIS.

16:04.734 --> 16:06.997
AMANDA, PLEASE.
 (sighs deeply)

16:06.997 --> 16:10.100
LOOK, IF WE DO THIS,
IF I FIND MY MOTHER,

16:10.100 --> 16:11.271
WE CAN BE DONE.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.642
YOU WILL NEVER BE DONE.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.446
(sighs)

16:16.446 --> 16:18.448
PLEASE. I NEED YOU
TO CALL VICTORIA.

16:18.448 --> 16:21.411
TELL HER
THAT YOU'VE RECONSIDERED.

16:21.411 --> 16:24.354
TELL HER THAT YOU'LL TAKE
THE MONEY FOR THE JOURNALS

16:24.354 --> 16:26.356
AND ASK HER TO WRITE YOU
A CHECK FOR $100,000.

16:26.356 --> 16:27.687
WHAT DO WE NEED
HER MONEY FOR?

16:27.687 --> 16:29.359
WE DON'T NEED HER MONEY.

16:29.359 --> 16:31.421
WE NEED HER SIGNATURE.

16:32.622 --> 16:34.364
(sighs)

16:34.364 --> 16:36.396
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:36.396 --> 16:39.469
TO THINK.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.406
(sighs)

16:48.408 --> 16:50.480
(Padma) WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT A LAWSUIT

16:50.480 --> 16:54.013
Zingstur.com BROUGHT
AGAINST YOU IN 2001?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.145
YOU EVER HEAR OF THEM?

16:55.145 --> 16:56.416
NO.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.119
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY LOST.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.290
END OF STORY.

17:00.290 --> 17:01.321
YOU ALL RIGHT?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.056
YEAH.

17:06.056 --> 17:08.098
MM.

17:08.098 --> 17:11.201
WHEW.
I GOTTA GET SOME AIR.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.220
(woman)
YOU KNOW THE ORIGINAL OWNERS

17:30.220 --> 17:33.052
FOUGHT 20 YEARS FOR THE RIGHT
TO DEVELOP THIS LAND?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.384
ONLY TO SEE THEIR DREAMS

17:34.384 --> 17:37.127
OF TURNING THIS SWAMP
INTO A THRIVING METROPOLIS

17:37.127 --> 17:40.390
BURST LIKE
A PROVERBIAL BUBBLE.

17:42.532 --> 17:43.833
THEY PUT IN ALL THE WORK,

17:43.833 --> 17:46.336
YOU BUY ON THE CHEAP

17:46.336 --> 17:47.497
AND REAP ALL THE BENEFIT.

17:47.497 --> 17:49.469
IT'S A ZERO-SUM WORLD,
MR. GRAYSON.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.302
ONE MAN'S LOSS,
ANOTHER MAN'S GAIN.

17:52.302 --> 17:54.404
WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING
ON SHORT NOTICE.

17:54.404 --> 17:57.477
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I HAD A CHOICE.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.549
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE.

17:59.549 --> 18:01.481
IT'S WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH YOUR CHOICES

18:01.481 --> 18:03.153
IS THE QUESTION.

18:06.456 --> 18:09.419
SO I TAKE IT YOU'VE BEEN
WATCHING THE NEWS VERY CLOSELY

18:09.419 --> 18:13.223
SINCE YOUR AGENT WENT ROGUE,
TAKING MY WIFE HOSTAGE.

18:13.223 --> 18:14.864
YES.

18:14.864 --> 18:16.566
YES, A CURIOUS BETRAYAL

18:16.566 --> 18:19.229
AFTER DECADES OF LOYAL SERVICE
TO THE ORGANIZATION.

18:19.229 --> 18:20.530
HE'S BEEN MAKING
SUBSEQUENT THREATS,

18:20.530 --> 18:22.232
AND I FEAR FOR MY FAMILY.

18:22.232 --> 18:25.175
I NEED ASSURANCES
THAT YOU CAN CONTROL HIM.

18:25.175 --> 18:26.576
AS FAR AS WE'RE ABLE TO DISCERN,
HE'S OFF THE GRID,

18:26.576 --> 18:30.440
BUT REST ASSURED,
WE WILL FIND HIM.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.643
AND WHEN WE DO,
WE'LL BE MOST INTERESTED

18:33.643 --> 18:35.745
IN HEARING HIS SIDE
OF THE STORY.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.845
"CHARLOTTE CLARKE."

29:05.845 --> 29:07.516
THEY MATCH.

29:07.516 --> 29:09.348
WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU VISITED HER?

29:09.348 --> 29:10.519
(static crackling)
 THIS IS POINTLESS.

29:10.519 --> 29:13.122
EITHER YOU SHOW YOURSELF OUT

29:13.122 --> 29:15.124
OR I WILL HAVE YOU ESCORTED.

29:15.124 --> 29:16.856
(static crackles)

29:16.856 --> 29:19.859
GO AFTER HER.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.831
WHY WERE YOU THERE,
VICTORIA?

29:21.831 --> 29:22.832
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

29:22.832 --> 29:24.193
OH, LET IT GO.
IF YOUR FATHER WERE HERE,

29:24.193 --> 29:25.835
HE WOULD TELL YOU
THE SAME THING.

29:25.835 --> 29:28.137
MY FATHER TOLD ME SHE WAS DEAD.
WHY WOULD HE LIE?

29:28.137 --> 29:29.298
BUT WHY?

29:29.298 --> 29:30.840
WHY WOULD HE MAKE ME BELIEVE
SHE WAS DEAD

29:30.840 --> 29:32.471
WHEN SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY
STILL ALIVE?

29:32.471 --> 29:34.203
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

29:34.203 --> 29:35.905
SO AM I.

29:35.905 --> 29:37.176
FIND OUT WHERE SHE IS.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.878
(static crackles)
 YEAH, BUT FROM WHAT?

29:38.878 --> 29:40.349
AMANDA?

29:40.349 --> 29:42.281
HE WOULD RATHER HAVE YOU
BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS DEAD

29:42.281 --> 29:44.854
THAN TO TELL YOU
THE UNSPEAKABLE TRUTH.

29:44.854 --> 29:47.186
WHAT? TELL ME.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.358
(static crackles)
 AMANDA. DAMN IT.

29:49.358 --> 29:52.822
YOUR MOTHER
TRIED TO KILL YOU.

29:52.822 --> 29:55.194
THAT'S A LIE.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.026
I WISH IT WAS.

29:57.026 --> 29:59.568
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH HATRED
YOU HARBOR TOWARD ME,

29:59.568 --> 30:02.271
IT IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH!

30:02.271 --> 30:03.572
AAH!
 (thuds)

30:03.572 --> 30:04.974
(gasps)
 (thud)

30:07.276 --> 30:08.537
MARTA!

30:08.537 --> 30:11.580
SOMEONE, CALL 9-1-1!

30:11.580 --> 30:14.383
(Charlotte)
WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED?

30:14.383 --> 30:17.046
OH, MY GOD. AMANDA.

30:17.046 --> 30:18.247
AMANDA.

30:18.247 --> 30:19.548
AMANDA.

30:19.548 --> 30:21.851
(keypad beeps, phone rings)

30:21.851 --> 30:23.893
YES, WE NEED AN AMBULANCE
RIGHT AWAY.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.595
OH, OH, GOD.
 HANG IN THERE, AMANDA.

30:26.595 --> 30:28.858
HELP IS ON THE WAY.

30:35.905 --> 30:37.036
20s, PREGNANT FEMALE,
BLUNT HEAD TRAUMA...

30:37.036 --> 30:38.437
WHATEVER--
WHATEVER HAPPENS,

30:38.437 --> 30:40.409
YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE BABY.

30:40.409 --> 30:42.071
MAKE SURE THEY SAVE
THE BABY.

30:42.071 --> 30:43.442
NO, YOU'RE BOTH
GONNA BE FINE.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.575
TAKE THIS.
CALL JACK, PLEASE.

30:46.575 --> 30:47.877
I'M GOING WITH HER.

30:47.877 --> 30:49.348
ARE YOU FAMILY?
 I AM.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.480
I'M HER SISTER.
 CHARLOTTE.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.322
MOM, I'M GOING.

30:53.322 --> 30:56.585
(emergency radio chatter)

30:56.585 --> 30:58.527
(man) CLOSING.

30:58.527 --> 31:01.630
(siren wails)

31:01.630 --> 31:03.462
(Jack)
WE FAILED THE INSPECTION.

31:03.462 --> 31:04.994
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME
EXACTLY?

31:04.994 --> 31:06.435
THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP
TO YOUR WORD?

31:06.435 --> 31:07.967
I'M SAYING THAT THIS PLACE
IS MY INCOME,

31:07.967 --> 31:09.498
SO IF I CAN'T OPEN THE BAR...

31:09.498 --> 31:11.500
(sighs) MAYBE THERE'S
SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENT

31:11.500 --> 31:12.641
THAT COULD BE MADE.

31:12.641 --> 31:14.543
JACK, I...

31:14.543 --> 31:15.905
(cell phone rings)

31:15.905 --> 31:17.576
MAYBE THERE IS. I...

31:17.576 --> 31:19.548
(ring)

31:19.548 --> 31:20.509
(ring)

31:20.509 --> 31:22.011
EXCUSE ME.

31:22.011 --> 31:24.083
(beeps)

31:24.083 --> 31:25.584
HEY.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.886
OH, THANK GOD. (sniffles)

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
JACK, IT'S AMANDA.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.520
There's been an accident.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.992
WHAT?

31:32.992 --> 31:34.563
IS SHE OKAY?

31:34.563 --> 31:36.225
I DON'T KNOW.

31:36.225 --> 31:37.896
THEY TOOK HER
TO SUFFOLK MEMORIAL.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.668
I'M GONNA MEET YOU THERE,
OKAY?
 Yeah.

31:39.668 --> 31:41.370
HEY, LISTEN, IT'S--
IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

31:41.370 --> 31:45.104
I GOTTA... I'M SORRY.
WE'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT.

31:47.476 --> 31:49.408
(cell phone auto dials)

31:49.408 --> 31:51.380
(rings, line clicks)
 (man) What up?

31:51.380 --> 31:53.312
YOU DID GOOD.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.114
SO DID OUR INSPECTOR.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.615
COOL.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.587
DID YOU MAKE AN OFFER
ON THE BAR?

31:58.587 --> 32:01.520
AFTER THE DUST SETTLES.

32:03.592 --> 32:07.326
(clatters)

32:07.326 --> 32:08.657
(clicks switch)

32:13.662 --> 32:15.634
LET'S GET STARTED.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.182
VICTORIA!

32:34.623 --> 32:36.525
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

32:36.525 --> 32:39.258
VICTORIA,
WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?

32:39.258 --> 32:41.090
THEY'RE SAFE.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.592
IT'S AMANDA CLARKE'S BLOOD.
SHE FELL.

32:43.592 --> 32:46.065
ON OUR PROPERTY?

32:46.065 --> 32:48.137
YOU BETTER HOPE
IT'S NOT SERIOUS.

32:48.137 --> 32:50.569
IT'S VERY SERIOUS,
NO MATTER WHAT HER FATE.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.741
JUST BEFORE THE ACCIDENT,

32:52.741 --> 32:55.344
SHE CONFRONTED ME
WITH SOME OLD LOG-IN SHEETS

32:55.344 --> 32:57.346
FROM HER MOTHER'S HOSPITAL.

32:57.346 --> 33:00.379
SHE'S VERY CLOSE TO FIGURING OUT
THAT I HAND-DELIVERED KARA

33:00.379 --> 33:01.710
TO GORDON MURPHY.

33:01.710 --> 33:05.014
HOW COULD SHE
HAVE STUMBLED UPON THAT?

33:05.014 --> 33:07.216
SHE COULDN'T HAVE,
NOT WITHOUT HELP.

33:07.216 --> 33:08.687
(car door closes)

33:10.019 --> 33:11.320
OH, WELCOME HOME, DAD.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.491
HEY.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.692
GOOD TRIP?

33:13.692 --> 33:15.464
AH...

33:15.464 --> 33:17.396
LISTEN, I'M WIPED. I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA TURN IN, ALL RIGHT?

33:17.396 --> 33:18.567
OKAY.

33:18.567 --> 33:19.728
OKAY?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.272
(lowered voice) YOU...

33:23.272 --> 33:24.733
DIDN'T CALL ME BACK.

33:24.733 --> 33:26.605
(lowered voice) BECAUSE
THERE'S NOTHING TO REPORT.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.577
DANIEL ONLY HAS
YOUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.

33:28.577 --> 33:32.541
AND AS FOR ME, I AM DONE
BEING YOUR LITTLE SPY.

33:39.048 --> 33:43.052
WHO KNEW THERE WAS SUCH A THING
AS COMPETITIVE TETRIS?

33:43.052 --> 33:46.055
OH. (chuckles) YEAH.

33:46.055 --> 33:48.727
I LED A PETITION TO MAKE IT
A DEMONSTRATION SPORT

33:48.727 --> 33:51.230
AT THE '92 OLYMPICS.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.461
WE LOST.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.564
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE HELD ON TO THIS.

33:55.564 --> 33:57.236
HEY, THIS IS ALL
NOLCORP STUFF--

33:57.236 --> 34:00.739
INVESTOR PROSPECTS,
START-UP BUDGETS.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.642
I FOUNDED THE COMPANY

34:03.642 --> 34:05.714
IN MY DAD'S GARAGE

34:05.714 --> 34:08.417
THE SUMMER BEFORE
MY JUNIOR YEAR.

34:08.417 --> 34:10.649
WHEN I TOLD HIM I WASN'T
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL...

34:10.649 --> 34:12.781
MM, HE KICKED ME OUT.

34:12.781 --> 34:15.184
I SHOULD SORT THROUGH
IT ALL.

34:15.184 --> 34:17.456
COULD BE USEFUL
FOR THE AUDIT.

34:18.786 --> 34:20.629
PADMA...

34:20.629 --> 34:23.562
THANK YOU FOR...

34:23.562 --> 34:25.734
TAKING AN INTEREST.

34:25.734 --> 34:28.237
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

34:28.237 --> 34:30.369
IT'S MY JOB
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. (chuckles)

34:30.369 --> 34:32.771
'CAUSE...

34:32.771 --> 34:36.074
I WAS KINDA HOPING
MAYBE THIS HAD...

34:36.074 --> 34:39.178
NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE JOB.

34:40.549 --> 34:42.681
(chuckles)

34:44.112 --> 34:45.414
OH!

34:45.414 --> 34:46.655
(gasps)

34:49.558 --> 34:51.389
(grunts)

34:52.621 --> 34:54.623
CAN, UH... (sighs)

34:54.623 --> 34:56.195
WE TRY THAT AGAIN?

34:57.766 --> 34:59.698
I THINK WE SHOULD.

35:20.219 --> 35:21.820
(grunts)

35:21.820 --> 35:25.194
(pants)

35:25.194 --> 35:26.725
(grunts)

35:28.457 --> 35:30.699
(pants)

35:30.699 --> 35:32.631
(grunts)

35:32.631 --> 35:34.163
OH! OHH.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.142
(grunts)

35:44.142 --> 35:45.914
(woman on radio)
AND FINALLY, IN SOCIETY NEWS,

35:45.914 --> 35:48.847
AMANDA CLARKE, DAUGHTER OF
TERRORIST DAVID CLARKE

35:48.847 --> 35:52.181
AND A RECENT ADDITION TO
VICTORIA GRAYSON'S FAMILY FOLD,

35:52.181 --> 35:53.882
HAS BEEN RUSHED
TO SUFFOLK MEMORIAL

35:53.882 --> 35:56.585
WITH SERIOUS
BUT UNSPECIFIED INJURIES.

35:56.585 --> 35:58.427
AMANDA CLARKE WAS APPARENTLY

35:58.427 --> 35:59.858
AT THE GRAYSONS'
SOUTHAMPTON ESTATE

35:59.858 --> 36:01.730
AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.

36:01.730 --> 36:04.893
(indistinct conversations)

36:04.893 --> 36:07.165
AMANDA CLARKE'S FAMILY?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.167
THAT'S US. THAT'S US.
I'M AMANDA'S...

36:09.167 --> 36:10.799
I'M THE FATHER.

36:10.799 --> 36:12.301
HOW ARE THEY?

36:12.301 --> 36:13.802
THE ABRUPTION'S CAUSED

36:13.802 --> 36:15.304
A DECREASE IN BLOOD FLOW
TO YOUR SON.

36:15.304 --> 36:16.645
HE'S BEING DEPRIVED
OF OXYGEN.

36:16.645 --> 36:18.447
THE LONGER WE WAIT TO DELIVER,
THE WORSE THE OUTCOME.

36:18.447 --> 36:19.778
THEN WHY ARE YOU WAITING?

36:19.778 --> 36:21.880
IT'S HIGH RISK. AMANDA'S ALREADY
LOST A GOOD DEAL OF BLOOD.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.882
AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE
A CONCLUSIVE ASSESSMENT

36:23.882 --> 36:25.354
OF HER INTERNAL INJURIES.

36:25.354 --> 36:27.886
OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GONNA TRY
TO SAVE MOTHER AND SON,

36:27.886 --> 36:30.859
BUT IF THERE COMES A POINT
WHERE A DECISION MUST BE MADE--

36:30.859 --> 36:33.492
THE BABY.
IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

36:33.492 --> 36:36.365
SHE TOLD ME WHEN THEY WERE
PUTTING HER IN THE AMBULANCE.

36:36.365 --> 36:40.499
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

36:40.499 --> 36:42.371
OKAY.

36:42.371 --> 36:46.275
SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.
SHE HAS TO BE.

36:46.275 --> 36:49.278
(indistinct conversations)

36:54.613 --> 36:56.745
(inhales deeply)

36:56.745 --> 36:57.886
(exhales)

36:57.886 --> 37:00.889
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HOW AWFUL I WAS TO HER,

37:00.889 --> 37:02.721
THE LAST THINGS I SAID.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.753
JACK, DON'T DO THAT
TO YOURSELF.

37:04.753 --> 37:06.695
(sniffles)

37:07.856 --> 37:08.827
(alarm beeping)

37:08.827 --> 37:09.998
(woman) CODE BLUE, ROOM THREE!

37:09.998 --> 37:12.401
CODE BLUE, CODE BLUE,
ROOM THREE!

37:12.401 --> 37:14.963
(beeping continues)

37:14.963 --> 37:16.465
(Jack) AMANDA!

37:16.465 --> 37:18.967
(beeping continues)

37:23.842 --> 37:25.013
HOW IS SHE?

37:25.013 --> 37:26.775
WE HAD TO PERFORM
AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION.

37:26.775 --> 37:28.847
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE WAS ALREADY
BATTLING INTERNAL INJURIES

37:28.847 --> 37:30.419
AND MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS.

37:30.419 --> 37:32.281
WE WERE FORCED
TO INDUCE A COMA.

37:32.281 --> 37:33.852
HOW'S THE BABY?

37:33.852 --> 37:35.954
HIS OXYGEN LEVELS
ARE LOWER THAN WE'D LIKE,

37:35.954 --> 37:37.926
SO WE'VE PUT HIM
IN THE NICU FOR TREATMENT.

37:37.926 --> 37:39.257
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU CAN SEE HIM.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.859
CAN WE SEE AMANDA?

37:40.859 --> 37:42.991
NOT JUST YET.

37:42.991 --> 37:45.994
I'LL GET US COFFEES.

37:45.994 --> 37:49.338
(indistinct conversations)

37:51.400 --> 37:52.571
(Declan) HEY.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.272
HEY.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.974
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

37:55.974 --> 37:57.976
UH...

37:57.976 --> 37:59.578
JUST...

37:59.578 --> 38:01.049
I'M A DAD.

38:01.049 --> 38:02.911
BUT--BUT THAT'S--
THAT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT?

38:02.911 --> 38:06.515
(voice breaking) AMANDA...

38:06.515 --> 38:08.617
SHE'S NOT GOOD, MAN.

38:08.617 --> 38:09.788
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
NOT GOOD?

38:09.788 --> 38:10.919
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY,
RIGHT?

38:10.919 --> 38:13.061
(mouths words)

38:13.061 --> 38:15.424
JACK, I'M--I'M SORRY.

38:15.424 --> 38:18.066
I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.

38:18.066 --> 38:20.399
COME HERE.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.970
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

38:21.970 --> 38:22.971
