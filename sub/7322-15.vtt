(Richard) I'VE SEEN
A LOT OF SURGERY RESIDENTS

00:04.505 --> 00:06.507
COME AND GO IN MY TIME,

00:06.507 --> 00:09.210
AND THEY'RE ALL ADDICTED...
TO SURGERY.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.142
IT COMES BEFORE FOOD,

00:11.142 --> 00:13.714
BEFORE SLEEP.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.716
IT BECOMES
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING...

00:15.716 --> 00:17.088
WHAT?

00:17.088 --> 00:19.120
NOTHING.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.152
WELL, GO AWAY.

00:21.152 --> 00:23.023
YOU LOOK NICE.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.396
GO AWAY.

00:25.396 --> 00:28.799
THE ONLY THING.

00:28.799 --> 00:34.034
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW
IS THAT LIVING ON THAT HIGH...

00:34.034 --> 00:36.036
CAN EAT THEM ALIVE.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.038
I CAN'T DO IT. (retches)
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.471
OH, MY GOD.
I'M GONNA HURL AGAIN.
OKAY, PLEASE DON'T,

00:40.471 --> 00:44.215
'CAUSE I JUST GOT THE LAST
OF THE PUKE OUT OF YOUR HAIR.
WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THIS?

00:44.215 --> 00:46.647
I'M NOT A PUBLIC SPEAKER.
IT'S NOT MY THING.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.650
GOD, I HATE DEREK SHEPHERD.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TALK
ABOUT BEING A GREAT SURGEON.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.682
TO A GIANT ROOM
FULL OF PEOPLE...

00:51.682 --> 00:53.554
FROM A GIANT STAGE.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.686
OH, GOD.
WITH A MICROPHONE.

00:55.686 --> 00:58.359
SOME MAKE IT THROUGH.

00:58.359 --> 01:02.133
THEY COME OUT
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

01:02.133 --> 01:06.697
THEY SURVIVE
WITH THEIR SANITY INTACT.

01:06.697 --> 01:09.370
(Switchfoot's "Always" playing)

01:09.370 --> 01:12.203
THEY BECOME... BETTER DOCTORS

01:12.203 --> 01:16.307
AND STRONGER PEOPLE.

01:16.307 --> 01:20.151
I DIDN'T.

01:20.151 --> 01:22.213
I BROKE.

01:22.213 --> 01:24.185
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

01:24.185 --> 01:28.459
AND I GIVE THANKS
FOR THAT EVERY DAY.

01:28.459 --> 01:30.861
BUT I HURT PEOPLE,

DON'T WANT TO COME BACK.

WE SHOULD ALSO LEARN--

FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S
EXPERIENCES.

03:05.256 --> 03:06.917
THEIR LOSSES

03:06.917 --> 03:08.889
WILL SAVE YOU LOSSES.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.862
THEIR MISTAKES
WILL SAVE YOU MISTAKES.

03:11.862 --> 03:14.625

NOTHING HELPS THE PAIN.

05:00.070 --> 05:03.474
UH, UH, WELL,
I WAS WONDERING--
BLOOD DRAW
IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU?

05:03.474 --> 05:06.607
NO. I CAN DRAW BLOOD.
I-I-I JUST WANTED--

05:06.607 --> 05:08.609
YOU DON'T HAVE WANTS OR NEEDS.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.911

IS GOING ON HERE?

LOOK, THIS IS NO JOB

LOOK AT THIS.

19:59.329 --> 20:02.302
LOOK AT MY FOOT.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.374
WATCH IT.

20:04.374 --> 20:07.206
(chuckles)

20:07.206 --> 20:09.609
YOU DID THAT FOR ME.

20:09.609 --> 20:14.414
SINCE I WAS 7, I HAVE
NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.919
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN DIFFERENT.

20:19.919 --> 20:24.324
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN STARED AT.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.927
I WANT TO WALK.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.960
I WANT TO STAND STRAIGHT UP.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.905
I BELIEVE
YOU CAN DO THE REST.

20:35.905 --> 20:38.708
PLEASE.

20:40.870 --> 20:43.843
PLEASE TRY.

20:45.415 --> 20:48.418
(Richard) NO SURGEON LIKES
GIVING UP ON A PATIENT.

20:48.418 --> 20:52.382
DR. GREY AND I LIKED IT
EVEN LESS THAN MOST.

20:52.382 --> 20:54.624
BUT WHEN A PATIENT
REFUSES TREATMENT,

20:54.624 --> 20:56.956
YOU'RE DONE.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.729
I MEAN, WE WERE DONE.

20:59.729 --> 21:03.363
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE THOUGHT ANYHOW.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.436
(woman) I PUT IN
THE N.G. TUBE, DOCTOR.

21:06.436 --> 21:09.038
OKAY.

21:09.038 --> 21:11.901
DR. GREY,
LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AS USUAL.

21:11.901 --> 21:14.504
FLATTERY WILL GET YOU
TO AN ON-CALL ROOM

21:14.504 --> 21:17.377
IN FIVE MINUTES OR LESS.
YOU'RE ON.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.449
(Meredith)
MOMMY! MOMMY! LOOK!

21:22.412 --> 21:25.585
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

21:25.585 --> 21:29.719
SHE WAS CRYING.
SHE MISSES YOU.

21:29.719 --> 21:32.462
AND I GOT DESPERATE.

21:32.462 --> 21:33.393
RICHARD.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.896
THATCHER, HOW ARE YOU?

21:36.896 --> 21:41.000
I ONLY HAVE A FEW SECONDS.
SHOW ME YOUR DOLL.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.003
(pagers beeping)
(man) DR. GREY, DR. WEBBER,
STAT TO EMERGENCY.

21:44.003 --> 21:47.036
I GOTTA GO, THATCH.
MOMMY, DON'T GO!

21:47.036 --> 21:48.508
TAKE HER.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.510
THATCHER, I HAVE TO GO.
MEREDITH.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.342
MOMMY, NO.

21:52.342 --> 21:54.083
MOMMY.

21:54.083 --> 21:56.446
DON'T GO.

21:56.446 --> 21:59.719
DR. GREY, DR. WEBBER,
STAT TO THE E.R.

21:59.719 --> 22:02.792
(staff murmuring)

22:05.355 --> 22:07.557
KAPOSI'S SARCOMA.

22:07.557 --> 22:11.330
YOUR G.R.I.D. PATIENT
FROM A FEW MONTHS BACK.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.962
HANDLE IT.

22:12.962 --> 22:17.667
(murmuring continues)

22:24.744 --> 22:26.345
(murmuring continues)

22:26.345 --> 22:28.347
I'M SORRY I...

22:28.347 --> 22:30.019
YOU WERE RIGHT.

22:30.019 --> 22:32.482
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

22:32.482 --> 22:34.784
PLEASE...

22:34.784 --> 22:37.587
PLEASE...

22:37.587 --> 22:39.489
HELP ME.

22:53.042 --> 22:54.774
A HEALTHY APPENDIX--

22:54.774 --> 22:57.647
THE THIRD SURGERY
FOR THIS PATIENT

22:57.647 --> 23:01.150
WITH UNRELENTING ABDOMINAL PAIN,
FATIGUE AND MUSCLE PAIN.

23:01.150 --> 23:03.913
NOW WHAT?
TEST FOR ZEBRAS.
UM, UNCOMMON DISEASES.

23:03.913 --> 23:05.915
OKAY.

23:05.915 --> 23:08.087
DO AN A.N.A. FOR LUPUS.
LUPUS. YEAH.

23:08.087 --> 23:11.821
WHOA, WHAT ABOUT LEAD?
YOU TEST FOR LEAD?
GOOD, GOOD. SEE?

23:11.821 --> 23:13.823
SOMETIMES I-IT'S NOT EASY.

23:13.823 --> 23:16.826
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE
YOUR PATIENT'S ADVOCATE

23:16.826 --> 23:19.829
AND PUSH TO GET THINGS DONE.

23:19.829 --> 23:21.831
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

23:21.831 --> 23:24.434
EXCUSE ME, UH, DR. BAYLOW.

23:24.434 --> 23:26.436
ALICIA TATUM
IS BEING DISCHARGED

23:26.436 --> 23:28.438
WITH NOTHING BUT A NOTE
FOR A PSYCH CONSULT?

23:28.438 --> 23:30.440
SHE'S SNIFFING AROUND
FOR PAIN MEDS.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.542
SHE'S DEPRESSED,
IS HER PROBLEM.
WELL, YEAH.

23:32.542 --> 23:35.114
MONTHS OF SEVERE, UNTREATED PAIN
CAN BE DEPRESSING.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.716
OKAY, SMARTY PANTS.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.848
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
TEST FOR LUPUS

23:38.848 --> 23:40.820
OR, UM, LEAD POISONING

23:40.820 --> 23:42.121
OR LOOK,
EVEN HEMOCHROMATOSIS--

23:42.121 --> 23:44.754
WE ARE NOT ORDERING
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN TESTS

23:44.754 --> 23:47.757
FOR SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CURED
WITH A BIG DOSE OF PROZAC.

23:47.757 --> 23:50.159
BUT--
WHAT ARE WE DOING
WITH ALICIA TATUM?

23:50.159 --> 23:52.862
WE'RE TURFING HER TO PSYCH
FOR DEPRESSION.

23:52.862 --> 23:55.505
WELL, WE CUT HER OPEN THREE
TIMES AND DIDN'T CURE HER PAIN.

23:55.505 --> 23:57.507
WOULDN'T YOU BE DEPRESSED?
OF COURSE.

23:57.507 --> 23:59.939
B-BEFORE SHE GOES, I THOUGHT
WE COULD TEST FOR LUPUS

23:59.939 --> 24:02.011
OR LEAD POISONING
OR MAYBE HEMOCHROMATOSIS.

24:02.011 --> 24:04.514
HEMOCHROMATOSIS.
NOW YOU'RE THINKING.

24:04.514 --> 24:06.916
GOOD WORK.

24:06.916 --> 24:09.619
(Ellis) OH, MY GOD. I THINK
THAT'S AN INTUSSUSCEPTION.

24:09.619 --> 24:12.151
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE
IN AN ADULT.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.154
WELL, I SUPPOSE
WE'D HANDLE IT THE SAME WAY

24:15.154 --> 24:16.656
AS WITH A KID, RIGHT?

24:16.656 --> 24:19.489
DR. GRACIE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IN THIS SITUATION?

24:19.489 --> 24:22.792
QUITE FRANKLY, NOTHING.
I WOULDN'T OPERATE.

24:22.792 --> 24:25.795
THIS PATIENT'S A LOST CAUSE.
HE'S GOT G.R.I.D.

24:25.795 --> 24:29.038
IT'S CALLED A.I.D.S. NOW.

24:29.038 --> 24:30.840
A.I.D.S.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.843
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S CAUSING IT
OR HOW IT SPREADS.

24:33.843 --> 24:36.606
YOU WANT ME TO POTENTIALLY RISK
THE HEALTH OF MY STAFF,

24:36.606 --> 24:39.108
MY OWN LIFE, FOR A GUY
WITH A DEATH SENTENCE?

24:39.108 --> 24:41.511
NO, I'M NOT DOING IT.

24:41.511 --> 24:43.513
AND I RECOMMEND
YOU DON'T DO IT EITHER.

24:43.513 --> 24:46.255
WE TOOK AN OATH.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HEALERS.

24:46.255 --> 24:47.757
TEN YEARS AGO,

24:47.757 --> 24:50.259
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE
BEEN ALLOWED IN THIS PROGRAM.

24:50.259 --> 24:53.492
DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME
WHAT KIND OF OATH WE TAKE.

24:56.165 --> 24:59.098
(Callie) WE'D HIT A WALL.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.170
AND, UM...

25:01.170 --> 25:03.533
WE PLANNED A NUMBER
OF PROCEDURES.

25:03.533 --> 25:05.504
BUT, UM...

25:05.504 --> 25:07.276
UH, BUT THEN...

25:07.276 --> 25:09.739
THEN I GAVE YOU
THAT ROUSING PEP TALK.

25:09.739 --> 25:11.240
(audience laughs)

25:11.240 --> 25:13.913
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU TOTALLY DID. (laughs)

25:13.913 --> 25:15.915
WHAT IF I HAD QUIT
IN THE ELEVATOR?

25:15.915 --> 25:18.688
WHAT IF I HAD FROZEN? I MEAN,
I HAD EVERY REASON TO FREEZE.

25:18.688 --> 25:21.220
I'M AN INTERN. I NEVER HAD
MY HAND ON A HEART BEFORE.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.222
NO REASON FOR ME TO THINK

25:23.222 --> 25:26.095
I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
BUT KILL THAT COP FASTER.
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

25:26.095 --> 25:27.597
NO, I DIDN'T.

25:27.597 --> 25:29.599
I-I CUT HIM OPEN,
I CROSS-CLAMPED THE AORTA,

25:29.599 --> 25:32.201
I STUCK MY FINGER IN THE HOLE
AND I STOPPED THE BLEEDING.

25:32.201 --> 25:34.303
IT WAS SEAMLESS.
I WAS PERFECT.

25:34.303 --> 25:36.005
SO PRETEND
THERE'S A BLACKOUT

25:36.005 --> 25:38.908
AND YOU'RE STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR
AND YOUR GUY IS BLEEDING OUT.

25:38.908 --> 25:42.171
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
ARE YOU GONNA JUST QUIT?
(Meredith)
WHAT WAS THE RESULT?

25:42.171 --> 25:44.243
DID SHE TEST POSITIVE
FOR HEMOCHROMATOSIS?
(Miranda) NOPE.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.245
(indistinct shouting)
UH, WHAT ABOUT LIME DISEASE?

25:46.245 --> 25:49.548
LIME DISEASE--NEGATIVE.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.050
CELIAC DISEASE--NEGATIVE.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.222
EVERY TEST
I COULD THINK OF--NEGATIVE.

25:53.222 --> 25:56.185
SO I DID WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU ALL
TO DO WHEN YOU GET STUCK.

25:56.185 --> 25:59.258
I WENT TO THE LIBRARY
AND I HIT THE BOOKS.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.761
I HIT 'EM HARD.

26:01.761 --> 26:05.264
I WAS RAISED TO BE POLITE,
YOU KNOW?

26:05.264 --> 26:07.637
DON'T RAISE YOUR VOICE,

26:07.637 --> 26:11.941
HAVE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE
HIGHER IN THE PECKING ORDER,

26:11.941 --> 26:13.943
BE GENEROUS TO THOSE BELOW--

26:13.943 --> 26:15.945
I WAS NOT RAISED
TO BE A SHARK.

26:15.945 --> 26:17.907
NOW DOES THAT
MAKE ME A MINNOW?

26:17.907 --> 26:19.208
AM I A MINNOW?

26:19.208 --> 26:20.910
I-I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

26:20.910 --> 26:22.812
(voice breaking)
I'M A MINNOW.

26:22.812 --> 26:23.983
OH.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.755
NOT BECAUSE OF MY HEIGHT.

26:25.755 --> 26:30.019
BECAUSE I'M A MINNOW
ON THE INSIDE.

26:30.019 --> 26:33.122
♪♪

26:33.122 --> 26:36.295
THAT IS A SAD STATE
OF AFFAIRS, JOE.

26:36.295 --> 26:39.128
(man) ♪ WILL YOU COME HOME?
WILL YOU COME HOME? ♪

26:39.128 --> 26:40.630
♪ PLEASE COME HOME ♪

26:40.630 --> 26:43.132
(Richard) HELL,
WE WEREN'T NOBLE.

26:43.132 --> 26:45.905
WE WERE JUST MORE ARROGANT
THAN THE REST

26:45.905 --> 26:48.207
AND HAD MORE TO PROVE.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.380
YOUR C.T. SHOWED THAT YOUR BOWEL
HAS TWISTED IN ON ITSELF,

26:51.380 --> 26:54.984
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF KAPOSI'S
LESIONS IN YOUR ABDOMEN.

26:54.984 --> 26:56.946
(Ellis)
IT'S A PRETTY RARE PROBLEM,

26:56.946 --> 26:59.348
BUT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF IT
WITH SURGERY.

26:59.348 --> 27:01.350
WILL DR. GRACIE
BE DOING THE SURGERY?

27:01.350 --> 27:03.052
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:03.052 --> 27:05.124
I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE STUCK WITH US.

27:08.898 --> 27:11.630
HE'S SCARED, ISN'T HE?

27:13.262 --> 27:15.705
JUST LIKE THEM, OUTSIDE.

27:15.705 --> 27:18.307
I CAN SEE THEM...

27:20.169 --> 27:23.943
POINTING, MUMBLING, STARING.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.414
SCREW THEM.

27:31.420 --> 27:33.422
I DON'T BLAME THEM...

27:33.422 --> 27:36.325
FOR BEING SCARED.

27:38.427 --> 27:41.130
(voice breaking)
I'M SCARED, TOO.

27:41.130 --> 27:45.394
I USED TO BE SCARED
THAT, UM...

27:45.394 --> 27:50.669
PEOPLE WOULD FIND OUT
THAT I WAS GAY AND...

27:50.669 --> 27:54.844
NOW, UM, I CAN'T EVEN
HIDE IT ANYMORE.

27:56.906 --> 27:59.408
(cries)

27:59.408 --> 28:02.852
I'M A--I'M A LEPER...

28:02.852 --> 28:05.084
AN OUTCAST...

28:05.084 --> 28:07.386
AN UNTOUCHABLE.

28:07.386 --> 28:12.291
NO ONE WILL LOOK AT ME.

28:12.291 --> 28:16.295
(sobs)
NO ONE WILL TOUCH ME.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.997
(sniffles)

28:17.997 --> 28:20.029
I WANT TO HATE EVERYONE

28:20.029 --> 28:22.401
FOR TREATING ME THIS WAY.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.373
BUT HOW...

28:24.373 --> 28:26.375
HOW CAN I HATE THEM
FOR BEING SCARED

28:26.375 --> 28:30.309
WHEN I'M THE ONE
THAT'S BEEN LIVING THE LIE?

28:30.309 --> 28:34.313
(sniffles)
(Ellis) THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO CHANGE THAT.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.315
HAVE THIS SURGERY,

28:36.315 --> 28:38.017
LET US OPERATE.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.318
WHAT'S THE POINT?

28:39.318 --> 28:42.421
NO ONE RECOVERS FROM THIS.

28:44.293 --> 28:45.795
NO ONE LIVES.

28:45.795 --> 28:47.256
(Richard) FOR ALL YOU KNOW,

28:47.256 --> 28:50.499
THERE COULD BE A CURE FOR THIS
THING TOMORROW OR NEXT WEEK.

28:50.499 --> 28:53.432
LET US OPERATE.

28:56.365 --> 28:58.938
(Callie) WE SPENT DAYS
TRYING TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT,

28:58.938 --> 29:02.071
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE BEST STRATEGY.

29:02.071 --> 29:04.343
SO WE, UH, WE RESEARCHED

29:04.343 --> 29:07.176
AND, UH,
PRACTICED AND PRACTICED,

29:07.176 --> 29:10.850
AND... EVENTUALLY,
WE WERE READY.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.522
OKAY, RETRACT
THE RECTUS FEMORIS.
WHAT ABOUT THE NERVE?

29:13.522 --> 29:16.355
(monitor beeping erratically)
B.P. JUST DROPPED
AND HE'S TACHYCARDIC.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.088
TORSADES ON THE MONITOR.
OH, MY GOD.
PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE?

29:19.088 --> 29:21.060
SOUNDS LIKE.
DAMN IT.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.492
OKAY, NOBODY PANIC.
PAGE CARDIO.

29:23.492 --> 29:27.136
ALEX, WE NEED TO DO
A SUBXIPHOID PERICARDIOTOMY

29:27.136 --> 29:29.198
TO DRAIN THE BLOOD
THAT'S SQUEEZING THE HEART.

29:29.198 --> 29:31.941
IT'S LIKE A MINIATURE VERSION
OF WHAT YOU DID IN THE ELEVATOR.

29:31.941 --> 29:34.373
SO GET A SCALPEL.
I CAN'T.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.345
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU CAN'T?
YOU ALREADY DID.

29:36.345 --> 29:38.547
TAKE THE SCALPEL.
I-I CAN'T.

29:38.547 --> 29:41.110
THE PATIENT IS CRASHING, KAREV.
DO THE ELEVATOR THING.

29:41.110 --> 29:43.813
I CAN'T. I'VE NEVER DONE THIS.
IT--IT W--IT WASN'T ME.

29:43.813 --> 29:45.554
I'M NOT
THE HEART-IN-THE-ELEVATOR GUY.

29:45.554 --> 29:48.387
IT WAS O'MALLEY.

29:48.387 --> 29:49.889
(exhales deeply)

29:58.127 --> 29:59.528
OKAY. OKAY.

29:59.528 --> 30:01.530
NO, THIS IS FINE.

30:01.530 --> 30:03.272
WE'RE FINE.

30:03.272 --> 30:05.304
AND YOU--
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.407
BUT I HAVEN'T--
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T.

30:08.407 --> 30:11.510
GET IT TOGETHER
AND TAKE THE SCALPEL.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.513
(monitor beeping erratically)

30:18.287 --> 30:21.150
OKAY.

30:21.150 --> 30:22.291
UH...

30:22.291 --> 30:25.524
MAKE A 6-CENTIMETER-LONG
INCISION

30:25.524 --> 30:30.299
OVER
THE XIPHISTERNAL JUNCTION.

30:30.299 --> 30:33.402
GOOD.

30:33.402 --> 30:36.405
(Richard) WE KNEW
WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS RISKY.

30:36.405 --> 30:38.467
THESE DAYS WE KNOW
THAT A.I.D.S. TRANSMISSION

30:38.467 --> 30:40.539
REQUIRES EXCHANGES
OF BODILY FLUIDS.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.912
BUT BACK THEN
WE HAD NO IDEA.

30:42.912 --> 30:45.444
CAN YOU GET IT FROM
CASUAL CONTACT, FROM THE AIR,

30:59.288 --> 31:01.030
WHAT?

31:01.030 --> 31:04.033
WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING WHAT
WE'RE DOING. WE HAVE TO STOP.

31:04.033 --> 31:06.035
NO. WE'RE NOT THE LIE.

31:06.035 --> 31:08.297
OUR MARRIAGES ARE THE LIE.

31:08.297 --> 31:10.369
THIS? US?

31:10.369 --> 31:13.372
THIS IS WHAT'S RIGHT.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.376
WE SHOULD LEAVE THEM,
RICHARD.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.378
YOU LEAVE ADELE,
AND I'LL LEAVE THATCHER.

31:19.378 --> 31:23.052
I CAN'T. YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER.
I CAN'T.

31:23.052 --> 31:25.354
AND NEITHER CAN YOU.

31:25.354 --> 31:27.486

31:27.486 --> 31:30.189
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO IN THERE.
I CAN DO THIS ALONE.

31:30.189 --> 31:33.192
YOU HAVE MEREDITH
TO THINK ABOUT.
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
THE REST OF THEM.

31:39.498 --> 31:42.501
THAT MAKES ME A MOTHER.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME INEPT.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.503
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME
LESS OF A WOMAN.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.505
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME
LESS OF A SURGEON.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.938

EVERYONE WANTS IT TO.

31:51.981 --> 31:53.582

31:53.582 --> 31:56.545
ALL MY RESEARCH
DIDN'T HELP.

31:56.545 --> 31:59.188
DR. BAYLOW
SENT THE PATIENT HOME.

31:59.188 --> 32:01.220
SO I THOUGHT SHE'D WON.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.123
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I WASN'T CUT OUT FOR THIS GAME.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.325

32:11.060 --> 32:12.601
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:12.601 --> 32:14.303
THE PAIN GOT REALLY BAD.

32:14.303 --> 32:18.007
THEY SAID MAYBE I HAVE SOME SORT
OF OBSTRUCTION OR SOMETHING

32:18.007 --> 32:20.009
FROM THE OTHER SURGERIES.

32:20.009 --> 32:23.372

32:27.116 --> 32:30.079

I CAN TAKE IT ANYMORE.

32:30.079 --> 32:33.082
PLEASE TELL ME
THIS SURGERY'S GONNA HELP.

32:33.082 --> 32:37.326

32:51.740 --> 32:53.742
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE BOLD?

32:53.742 --> 32:55.744
WELL, SHE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT ADHESIONS, RIGHT?

32:55.744 --> 32:58.307

(audience laughs)

32:58.307 --> 33:00.249
NO ADHESIONS. NO CANDY.

IT WAS STUPID.

33:03.182 --> 33:06.155
BUT IN THIS CASE,
IT WAS ALSO NECESSARY.

33:06.155 --> 33:10.319

YEAH, REBOOK MS. TATUM

33:22.101 --> 33:24.233
NO, D-DR. BAYLOW,
YOU WANTED TO GO IN

33:24.233 --> 33:26.305
AND EXPLORE HER OBSTRUCTION.

33:26.305 --> 33:29.408
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SIGNS OF ADHESIONS.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.410
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE SHE'S HAD
PREVIOUS SURGERIES

33:31.410 --> 33:34.413
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU SHOULDN'T
ACTUALLY LOOK FOR ANOTHER CAUSE.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.445
SHE HAS A PSEUDO-OBSTRUCTION

33:36.445 --> 33:39.048
THAT COULD BE RESOLVED
WITH AN N.G. TUBE.

33:39.048 --> 33:41.450
AND IF YOU'D LOOKED FURTHER

33:41.450 --> 33:43.452
AND I-I DON'T KNOW,
TALKED TO YOUR PATIENT,

33:43.452 --> 33:46.155
YOU WOULD'VE DISCOVERED THAT
ALONG WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN,

33:46.155 --> 33:48.557
SHE ALSO HAD,
UH, WEAKNESS, PALPITATIONS,

33:48.557 --> 33:50.399

33:50.399 --> 33:52.401

34:00.439 --> 34:03.142
IF YOU HAD
DIAGNOSED IT EARLIER,

34:03.142 --> 34:05.474

GETTING HER OVARIES TAKEN OUT

34:05.474 --> 34:07.446

34:07.446 --> 34:10.519

BETWEEN YOU AND ME?

34:15.824 --> 34:17.586

34:17.586 --> 34:19.558
I LEARNED WHEN NOT TO CUT.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.460
I LEARNED

34:28.167 --> 34:30.169

I HAD HER CHART

34:30.169 --> 34:32.171
WAS BECAUSE
YOU IGNORED MY PAGES
