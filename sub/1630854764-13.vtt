19:29.920 --> 19:31.380
Oh! You're a size 13?!

19:31.380 --> 19:33.382
Shh! Yes! Okay?

19:33.382 --> 19:35.175
That's why I always wear
these amazing hats.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.553
To draw the eye up!

19:38.136 --> 19:39.137
[sighs]

19:39.721 --> 19:41.390
How about a trade?

19:41.390 --> 19:43.809
Our silence for my ring back.

19:45.394 --> 19:46.812
And you'll delete that photo?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.065
Done.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.110
Pleasure doing business, Missy.

19:53.110 --> 19:55.070
[sighs] I agree.

19:55.070 --> 19:58.115
You know, I haven't had this much fun
since I got in a fistfight with my nanny.

19:59.575 --> 20:02.119
Hey. I will give you guys each a hat

20:02.119 --> 20:03.537
for a pint of your blood.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.207
No, no, it's not for anything weird.
Just, you know,

20:07.207 --> 20:09.209
to keep myself looking young.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.836
- Just a pint.
- Uh, Val?

20:10.836 --> 20:12.546
You gotta stop giving away your blood.

20:15.132 --> 20:16.800
There she is. Where you been?

20:17.509 --> 20:19.845
Uh, meeting my cousin.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.890
Damn it, Jake. [scoffs]

20:22.890 --> 20:24.766
I knew I should've gotten a real actor.

20:24.766 --> 20:27.227
Guy takes one improv class,
he thinks he's Brando.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.646
Okay, listen.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.317
I'm sorry.
I didn't know how to tell you that...

20:33.317 --> 20:35.986
this pop-up thing was really fun, but...

20:35.986 --> 20:38.488
I don't wanna shlep
into the city all the time.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.948
I'm happy with my shop.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.285
Got it.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.706
I guess I was just looking
for a reason for us to...

20:47.706 --> 20:51.502
keep getting to know each other
because we have <i>nothing</i> in common.

20:51.502 --> 20:54.755
And if we don't have a thing,
then maybe we're just going to

20:54.755 --> 20:56.298
drift out of each other's lives.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.799
Sophie.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.637
We don't need a thing to be
in each other's lives.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.682
Listen. I got divorced young.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.310
I don't date much
'cause I'm always at the shop.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.312
I was in a toxic on-and-off thing

21:10.312 --> 21:12.731
with my sauerkraut supplier.
You know Sharon DiMarco?

21:13.482 --> 21:15.692
Why would you?
She's just another lady.

21:16.235 --> 21:17.736
The point is...

21:18.362 --> 21:19.988
I kinda thought
it was too late for me

21:19.988 --> 21:23.367
when it came to the whole
"having a family" thing. But...

21:24.368 --> 21:27.871
you're a real game-changer, kid.
Best kind.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.547
Why wouldn't you just tell me
that you didn't want to do another pop-up?

21:36.547 --> 21:37.798
Oh.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.842
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

21:39.842 --> 21:41.343
[scoffs] What?

21:42.010 --> 21:45.389
What kind of a person
makes up such an elaborate lie

21:45.389 --> 21:47.891
just to avoid having
a tough conversation...

21:51.103 --> 21:52.604
Oh, my God.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.439

Last one of the night.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.664
I saved it for you.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.208
Thanks for letting me pop up.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.127
Thanks for not getting me murdered.

22:15.878 --> 22:18.422
- Any time.
- Yeah, you, too.

22:19.882 --> 22:22.426
Hey, babe.
Uh, can we talk for a second?

Oh, yeah.

Um, Val. Hey, look, I-I know I've been
acting really weird lately,

- but there's a reason--
- I know.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.439
And it's okay.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.566
If you have feelings
for this Ally person...

Ally? [laughs]

22:39.526 --> 22:42.446
I-I don't have feelings for Ally.
She's my party planner.

For our engagement party
that's happening next week! Surprise!
