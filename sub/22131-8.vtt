HAVE TO BE A GENIUS.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.215

-LAST TIME, HE WAS
JUST IN A BAD MOOD.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.977
HE'S NOT THAT MEAN.

07:36.586 --> 07:37.979
SOMETIMES, THE
PRESSURE GETS TO HIM.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.503
IT'S NOT EASY RAISING A
CHILD ALL BY YOURSELF.

07:40.634 --> 07:43.550

ON MY WRITTEN TEST.

10:42.685 --> 10:43.991
THEY ASKED ME TO PLAY A
GAME FOR THE PRODUCERS.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.732
MY BRAIN, IT JUST
STOPPED FUNCTIONING.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.516
I COULDN'T FIND THE CLICKER.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.649
WHEN I DID BUZZ IN, I WOULDN'T
GIVE THE RIGHT ANSWER,

10:49.779 --> 10:51.781
OR I WOULDN'T PHRASE IT
IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.523
IT WAS SO HUMILIATING.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.917
-WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS
"WHEEL OF FORTUNE."

11:13.890 --> 11:15.718
-I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.329
I'M JUST SIGNING UP A LITTLE

11:18.460 --> 11:21.202
AND GIVING HIM A RIDE HOME.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.687

12:08.728 --> 12:09.946
YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS.

12:22.002 --> 12:22.872
-WHAT IS THIS?

12:23.525 --> 12:25.353
-IT'S A PROGRAM
BAYWATCH RUNS FOR KIDS

12:25.483 --> 12:26.615
WHO WANT TO BECOME LIFEGUARDS,

12:26.746 --> 12:28.138
OR KIDS WHO JUST
LIKE THE WATER.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.358
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE GOOD FOR HIM.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.317
-WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU
KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR MY SON?

12:33.448 --> 12:34.275

12:34.405 --> 12:35.580
-TANNER: BUT, DAD--

12:35.711 --> 12:37.365

THE KID LIVES IN A FANTASY LAND.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.120
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.730
I THINK THE BEST
THING FOR YOU TO DO

12:54.861 --> 12:56.819
IS GO RECRUIT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.386
-THANKS A LOT.

-GET IN THE HOUSE!

LIKE TO STAY FOR DINNER?

13:09.005 --> 13:10.006
-NO, THAT'S IT.

13:12.661 --> 13:13.749
HAVE A NICE NIGHT.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.502
-HEY, I GUESS I WON'T
BE NEEDING THESE.

13:27.632 --> 13:28.982
-NO, NO, THAT'S
OKAY, YOU KEEP THEM.

13:29.112 --> 13:29.939
IT'S A GIFT.

13:30.984 --> 13:31.767
-YOU SURE?

13:31.898 --> 13:32.724
-YEAH, I'M SURE.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.987
-TANNER: THANKS, MITCH.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.337
SORRY MY DAD'S SUCH A JERK.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.905
I'LL TRY AND TALK HIM INTO IT.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.254
-OKAY.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.754
-MITCH: ALL RIGHT,
DANIELLE, GO, GO, GO!

14:05.845 --> 14:07.107
SOPHIE: THANK YOU!
MITCH: ALRIGHT.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.500
HAVE A GOOD ONE,
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!

14:09.631 --> 14:11.328
-HE'S LATE.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.853
-YEAH, IT'S 9:25, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET STARTED, HUH?

14:13.983 --> 14:16.116
-YOU KNOW, WE COULD WAIT A
FEW MORE MINUTES IF YOU WANT.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.552
-THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:17.682 --> 14:18.335
I DON'T THINK HE'S
GOING TO MAKE IT.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.904
-MITCH, YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
DONE EVERYTHING YOU COULD,

14:22.035 --> 14:23.601
MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE MORE
THAN YOU SHOULD HAVE.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.212
-WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:25.342 --> 14:27.257
-JUST THAT I'M CONCERNED.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.390
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING
EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED
IN A SITUATION

14:29.520 --> 14:30.870
OVER WHICH YOU
HAVE NO CONTROL.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.046
-WHAT CAN I SAY?
IT'S A CHARACTER FLAW.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.700
-WELL, I WOULDN'T CALL
IT A CHARACTER FLAW.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.181
I MEAN, YOU CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.009
THAT'S A GREAT THING,

14:40.140 --> 14:42.142
BUT SOMETIMES, YOU JUST TEND
TO OVERDO IT A LITTLE BIT.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.099
[MITCH LAUGHS]

14:43.230 --> 14:44.622
-ALEX: WHAT?

14:44.753 --> 14:46.842
-THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
MY EX-WIFE USED TO SAY.

14:46.973 --> 14:47.887
-TANNER: MITCH!

14:48.017 --> 14:49.279
-HEY, TANNER, YOU MADE IT!

14:49.410 --> 14:51.325
-SORRY I'M LATE.
CAN I STILL GET IN?

14:51.455 --> 14:53.240
-ABSOLUTELY, HERE YOU GO.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.806
-OKAY.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.765
-SO, WHAT MADE YOUR
DAD CHANGE HIS MIND?

14:57.592 --> 14:59.202
-WHO KNOWS?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.638
HE JUST WOKE UP THIS MORNING
AND TOLD ME I SHOULD GO.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.205
-WELL, WE'RE GLAD
TO HAVE YOU, TANNER.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.206
I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO EVERYONE, OKAY?

15:03.337 --> 15:04.164
-OKAY.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.078
-THIS IS TANNER.

15:05.208 --> 15:05.992
-HI, HOW ARE YOU?

15:06.122 --> 15:06.906
-OKAY.

15:07.036 --> 15:07.907
-GOOD!

15:08.777 --> 15:11.301
-ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING GOOD.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.443
-MITCH: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!

15:26.795 --> 15:28.797
ALL RIGHT, GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.320
-WE'RE GOING TO
GO IN THE WATER.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.800
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
LEAVE YOUR SHIRT ON?

15:31.931 --> 15:32.932
-YEAH, I'M SURE.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.455
-IT'S GOING TO FILL
UP WITH WATER.

15:34.585 --> 15:35.804
-I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.110
-IT PROBABLY WON'T
BE THAT COMFORTABLE.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.720
-I'M STILL NOT TAKING IT OFF.

15:38.850 --> 15:39.895
-OKAY.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.734
-HEY.

15:52.864 --> 15:53.735
-HEY.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.999
SO, WHAT'S THE NEXT
MOVE WITH J.D.?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.915
-[LAUGHS] I DON'T KNOW.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.917
I CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER I
SHOULD SIT BACK AND WAIT,

16:02.048 --> 16:02.962
OR POUNCE.

16:03.614 --> 16:04.398
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:04.528 --> 16:06.226
-POUNCE. [LAUGHTER]

16:06.356 --> 16:08.880
GUYS LOVE IT WHEN WOMEN
ARE THE AGGRESSORS.

16:09.011 --> 16:09.925
-YEAH?

16:10.056 --> 16:11.057
-JUST GO AND ASK HIM OUT.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.449
-WHAT IF HE SAYS NO.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.277
-HE'S NOT GOING TO SAY NO.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.584
-I DON'T KNOW HOW
I FEEL ABOUT THAT.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.630
BESIDES, ALL J.D. HAS
TO DO IS SMILE AT ME.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.850
I'M COMPLETELY
OFF IN LA-LA LAND.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.113
I FEEL LIKE I'M
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL

16:24.244 --> 16:25.897
WHEN I HAD A CRUSH ON THE
CAPTAIN OF THE SWIM TEAM.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.249
HE'D STOP BY MY LOCKER AND I'D
ALWAYS FORGET MY COMBINATION.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.165
-I'LL TALK TO HIM IF YOU WANT.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.905
-WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

16:34.776 --> 16:38.867
-I'D SAY, "J.D., JESS
HAS GOT THE HOTS FOR YOU.
GO GET HER."

16:38.998 --> 16:40.216
-THANKS A LOT.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.131
THAT'S ALL I NEED. [LAUGHTER]

16:43.263 --> 16:44.307
-OH, HI, J.D.

UM, HAVE A NICE SHOWER!

16:57.625 --> 16:58.452
-J.D.: THANKS.

16:59.279 --> 17:00.149
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

17:36.794 --> 17:37.665
-HEY.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.538
WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

17:41.669 --> 17:44.280

CLOTHES ON HERE, PAL.

17:46.282 --> 17:47.414
-NOT REALLY.

17:47.544 --> 17:48.415
-TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

17:48.980 --> 17:49.981
-I DON'T WANT TO.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.461
-COME ON, TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

17:51.592 --> 17:52.201
YOU CAN WEAR MY JACKET.
COME ON, COME ON.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.346
HERE YOU GO.

-STILL ON HOLD?

18:24.625 --> 18:26.453
-YEAH, IT'S BEEN
10 MINUTES NOW.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.411
-YEAH, THEY'RE
SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED.

18:28.542 --> 18:29.891
YOU THINK WE'VE
HAD BUDGET CUTS.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.022
YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT
THE COUNTY'S DONE

18:31.153 --> 18:31.936
WITH CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.112
-HOW'S TANNER DOING?

18:33.808 --> 18:34.678
-HE'S WORKING OUT.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.725
I CALLED HIS HOUSE.
THERE'S STILL NO ANSWER.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.467
-HERE.

18:42.817 --> 18:43.644
-WHERE YOU GOING?

18:43.774 --> 18:44.601
-TAKING HIM HOME.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.603
-THERE'S NO ONE THERE.

18:46.734 --> 18:47.735
-I'M KNOW THAT. I'M
TAKING HIM TO MY HOUSE.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.040
-YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

18:49.171 --> 18:50.999
-ALEX, HE HASN'T
EATEN SINCE LUNCH.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.696
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS FIX HIM DINNER.

18:52.827 --> 18:53.958
-MITCH, PLEASE,
LET'S WORK THROUGH

18:54.089 --> 18:55.395
THE PROPER CHANNELS ON THIS.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.005
IF THERE'S EVIDENCE
OF CHILD ABUSE,

18:57.136 --> 18:58.702
WE NEED TO GET IT DOCUMENTED.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.313
YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE A
CHILD FROM HIS FATHER.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.271
-I'M NOT KIDNAPPING
HIM. I'M FEEDING HIM.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.752
-LOOK, I AM ON
YOUR SIDE ON THIS,

19:04.882 --> 19:07.189
BUT IF YOU DON'T WORK
WITHIN THE SYSTEM,

19:07.320 --> 19:08.756
IT'S GOING TO BACKFIRE.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.192
-IF YOU HEAR FROM HIS
FATHER, YOU CALL ME.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.672
I'LL BE BACK HERE

WE NEVER TALKED

22:03.147 --> 22:05.976
ABOUT THOSE MARKS ON YOUR BACK.

DID YOUR FATHER HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT?

22:10.372 --> 22:12.331
-UH, NO, NO, IT
WASN'T HIS FAULT.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.724
I'VE GOT A BIG MOUTH. I'VE
GOTTA LEARN TO KEEP IT SHUT.

-IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY,
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

22:20.904 --> 22:24.125
NOTHING YOU SAY OR
DO GIVES YOUR DAD

22:24.255 --> 22:26.127
THE RIGHT TO HIT
YOU LIKE THAT, OKAY?

37:26.809 --> 37:28.071
YOU NEVER MET ME, OKAY?

37:29.682 --> 37:31.597
[LAUGHTER]

37:36.732 --> 37:37.733
-HI, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

37:37.864 --> 37:38.995
-SURE.

37:48.048 --> 37:51.051
I'M SORRY. THEY'RE GONE.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.359
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING.

37:54.489 --> 37:55.403
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

37:57.623 --> 37:58.667
-DAMN IT!

38:13.508 --> 38:14.335
-HI.

38:15.075 --> 38:15.945
-HEY.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.731
-I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

38:18.861 --> 38:20.646
THEY'RE AWARE THAT
TANNER MAY BE IN DANGER,

38:20.776 --> 38:22.517
AND THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING
THEY CAN TO FIND HIM.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.171
-YEAH, WELL, GOOD LUCK.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.261
-I KNOW YOU MUST FEEL
BAD, BUT THE BOTTOM--

38:27.392 --> 38:28.784
-NOT AS BAD AS HELPLESS.

38:30.743 --> 38:33.311
YOU THINK YOU COULD MAKE A
DIFFERENCE IN SOMEBODY'S LIFE,

38:34.529 --> 38:35.922
AND IT TURNS OUT TO
BE A WASTE OF TIME.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.141
-I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD
CALL IT A WASTE OF TIME.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.927
I DON'T THINK TANNER
WOULD CALL IT THAT EITHER.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.017
-I GUESS WE'LL
NEVER KNOW, HUH?

38:53.548 --> 38:54.419
-ALEX: EXCUSE ME.

38:55.811 --> 38:58.379
COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE WE
MIGHT FIND ALEX RYKER, PLEASE?

38:58.510 --> 39:01.164
-YEAH, YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.123
-THANK YOU.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.215
-WHAT?

39:17.442 --> 39:19.095
-MR. TREBEK, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:19.226 --> 39:20.836
-HI, ALEX, I JUST
WANTED TO COME BY

39:20.967 --> 39:23.099
AND THANK YOU PERSONALLY
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.885
-OH, I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.

39:26.015 --> 39:28.757
-I KNOW, BUT I ALSO WANTED
TO BE HERE TO TELL YOU

39:28.888 --> 39:30.411
THAT I'M REALLY SORRY

39:30.542 --> 39:32.370
THAT YOU WON'T BE A
CONTESTANT ON "JEOPARDY."

39:32.500 --> 39:34.502
-WHY?

39:34.633 --> 39:36.374
-YOU SEE, ONE OF THE RULES IS
THAT YOU CAN'T BE ON THE SHOW

39:36.504 --> 39:38.027
IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE
WHO WORKS THERE.

39:38.724 --> 39:39.725
SORRY.

39:43.250 --> 39:46.209
-DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD
MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN MY CASE?

39:46.340 --> 39:48.429
I MEAN, I DID SAVE
YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.779
-BOY, I REALLY WISH I
COULD BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,

39:50.910 --> 39:51.737
I DON'T MAKE THE RULES.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.696
BUT, I KNEW YOU'D
BE DISAPPOINTED,

39:54.827 --> 39:56.916
SO I BROUGHT YOU SOME OF OUR
"JEOPARDY" PARTING GIFTS.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.831
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.181
NOW, HERE'S THE LATEST VERSION
OF THE "JEOPARDY" HOME GAME.

40:01.311 --> 40:03.357
HERE'S SOMETHING YOU
CAN PLAY ON YOUR COMPUTER.

40:03.488 --> 40:04.837
HERE'S A GAME YOU
CAN HAVE FUN WITH

40:04.967 --> 40:06.099
BECAUSE IT TALKS BACK TO YOU.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.622
-THIS IS SO GREAT.

40:07.753 --> 40:09.102
-YOU'RE WORKING IN
THE SUN ALL THE TIME.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.451
YOU NEED A "JEOPARDY" CAP.

40:10.582 --> 40:12.410
TAKE A "JEOPARDY"
TEE SHIRT, ALSO.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.716
HEY, IT GETS COLD AT THE BEACH.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.196
HAVE A "JEOPARDY" SWEATSHIRT.

40:25.771 --> 40:26.554
-ALEX: HEY, MITCH.

40:26.685 --> 40:27.512
-HEY.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.472
-HEY, I FOUND THIS
IN TOWER 12 TODAY.

40:31.603 --> 40:32.604
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT THAT.

40:33.735 --> 40:34.606
-THANKS.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.869
-I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT
HEADQUARTERS, ALL RIGHT?

40:37.522 --> 40:38.392
-YEAH, RIGHT.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.103
-TANNER: DEAR MITCH,

40:54.234 --> 40:55.801
SORRY I DIDN'T GET A
CHANCE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

40:56.410 --> 40:58.586
MY DAD GOT A NEW JOB
AND WE HAD TO LEAVE.

40:59.326 --> 41:00.849
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING
YOU DID FOR ME.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.938
I'M REALLY, REALLY
GOING TO MISS YOU,

41:03.069 --> 41:04.940
AND I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER
HOW NICE YOU WERE.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.116
LOVE, TANNER.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.511
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
ME. I'LL BE OKAY.
