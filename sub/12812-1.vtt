The funny thing is,

the whole thing
didn't even show up.

on the murderboard?

_ need horror movies

This is a stupid waste Of time.

30:19.710 --> 30:22.042
They called late in the night.
They keep texting.

30:22.050 --> 30:23.472
It's more than just a prank.
Hey!

30:23.480 --> 30:26.142
Why don't you
get your friend a soda?

30:26.150 --> 30:30.257
Oh, okay. Yes, sir.
Right away.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.721
He wants to file a report,
but it's not up to him.

30:44.910 --> 30:50.303
Re-read this. If you want
to file it, you sign it.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.040

NOAH: You know, that clip
is still blowing up.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.496
We could use that digital
influence and my podcast

31:16.500 --> 31:18.434
_ to crowdsource
and find the caller ourselves.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.907
Stop, Noah! Just stop.

31:19.910 --> 31:23.232
Have you ever thought
that maybe it's your stupid,
crazy podcast that did this?

31:23.240 --> 31:26.175
Crazy? The Morgue?
You've been on it, like,
seven times already.

31:26.180 --> 31:30.219
Yeah, but maybe
it's time to stop obsessing
over these murders.

31:30.220 --> 31:34.247
It was just
a crank call, Noah. Let's go.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.511
(SCOFFS)

31:39.490 --> 31:41.219
Piper is dead.

That movie's over.

31:42.930 --> 31:45.922
Roll credits.
Leave the freaking theater.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.507
You know you can admit
that you miss Jake, right?

31:53.510 --> 31:58.129
I'm pissed that he turned
into the kind Of guy
that made me care.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.947
He's been MIA all day.

31:59.950 --> 32:02.919
He's torturing me.
He really made you care?

32:02.920 --> 32:04.979
He changed, Em.
He stepped up.

32:04.990 --> 32:09.859
You were gone. My dad was going
through all this legal crap.

32:09.860 --> 32:12.488
Jake was kind Of my rock.

32:12.490 --> 32:14.629
It's hard to imagine Jake
being anybody's rock.

32:14.630 --> 32:21.627

since you were away.

32:28.510 --> 32:29.977
He really missed you.

32:29.980 --> 32:33.939
Yeah, I think my freak-out
really freaked him out.

32:33.950 --> 32:35.474
He's been dodging me all day.

32:35.480 --> 32:39.576
Last night, it was like
he thought I was going
to break or something.

32:39.590 --> 32:43.082
I don't know. Maybe he just
sees me as the broken girl,

32:43.090 --> 32:44.910
and he's just not up for it.

32:44.930 --> 32:47.979
We're all breakable, Emma.
At least you had therapy.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.889
The rest of us just partied
the crazy away.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.652
You're probably
the strongest one of us all.

32:52.670 --> 32:57.596
NO, not Kieran. He's granite.
Trust me, he's breakable.

32:57.600 --> 33:02.867
Kieran doesn't go
into his dad's room.
That's how breakable he is.

33:02.880 --> 33:10.946
He just hides all that stuff.
You both do. You're both a mess.

33:11.550 --> 33:16.010
Now, grab me a trash bag.
You get one teddy bear. One!

33:16.020 --> 33:20.628

Nah. Figured I'd turn in,
you know?

33:35.280 --> 33:36.804
Get my dream journal on.

33:36.810 --> 33:39.233

So, I might have gotten a little
yell-y scream-y earlier.

33:45.020 --> 33:49.889
You only get that mad
when you know that I'm right.

33:49.890 --> 33:51.915
Shut up and walk me
through the murderboard.

33:51.930 --> 33:56.822
And we're back.
That text at school today was
your most recent contact, right?

33:56.830 --> 33:59.128
That's right.
Okay, here's that text.

33:59.130 --> 34:03.738
And, over here, I've included
the comments of the third
prankster from my podcast.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.935
Note the parallel verbiage,
the repeated phrases.

34:05.940 --> 34:09.706
Uh, bad-ass,
killer, bloodletter.
TOO close for coincidence.

34:09.710 --> 34:13.544
I'd wager that your texter
and the third prankster
are one and the same.

34:13.550 --> 34:16.849
So, some demented troll
with a grudge is out
to catfish me?

34:16.850 --> 34:23.153
Or this demented troll,
as you rightly put it,
was Piper's accomplice.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.088
There was no accomplice.

34:25.090 --> 34:26.819
I disagree.
I think someone helped Piper,

34:26.830 --> 34:28.183
and I think they're
still out there.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.896
I think that this prank
and those calls

34:30.900 --> 34:32.652
may lead us to that person.

NO, you weren't.

34:41.610 --> 34:46.843
I was. It was dumb to think
that we could just pick up
where we left Off

34:46.850 --> 34:48.647
and act like nothing
ever happened.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.619
That's what I was going for.
Yeah, I know.

34:51.620 --> 34:57.354
Because we both tend
to act like we're fine
when we're totally not.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.059
We should stop.
Yeah.

35:01.060 --> 35:02.789
We should.

35:03.100 --> 35:05.227
We could help each other.
