WEBVTT

00:08.267 --> 00:13.433
Knights had seconds in command,
just as chefs have sous chefs...

00:13.433 --> 00:15.200
Hi. Billie, can I speak
with you for a second?

00:15.200 --> 00:16.833
Oh... peh-- we're...
just in the middle of class.

00:16.833 --> 00:19.600
Yeah, I'd really love it
if you would do it.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.800
Uh... okay.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.933
I'll take over.

00:23.867 --> 00:26.500
My favorite knight? Jordan.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.833
Hey, uh...

00:27.833 --> 00:30.133
Billie, this is
Coach McLaughlin.

00:30.133 --> 00:31.933
And of course, you already
know Timothy.

00:31.933 --> 00:33.700
Hi, I'm Timothy.
I know.

00:33.700 --> 00:38.367
Billie, you have a student
in this class, Matthew Lee?

00:38.367 --> 00:39.900
Yeah, you do, you do.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.900
He just never really shows up.
Okay.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.867
He's very busy, he's the captain
of the fencing team.

00:43.867 --> 00:45.567
School's only Division One
sport.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.567
Yeah.
So...

00:49.033 --> 00:52.367
It's super important that
Matthew be allowed to compete.

00:52.367 --> 00:53.700
And if he gets another F...

00:53.700 --> 00:55.700
then he can't fence
in the Regionals, so...

00:55.700 --> 00:56.867
Oh, no, yeah.

00:56.867 --> 00:59.567
Are you trying to get me to pass
this guy?

00:59.567 --> 01:01.233
Well, I, uh don't-- B-- Billie.
Oh, wow.

01:01.233 --> 01:03.767
Billie, Bi--
Somebody's paranoid.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.933
We're just asking that you
be invested...

01:05.933 --> 01:07.133
in his future at this school.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.267
Okay.
And also, here's a note.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.600
We do want you to pass him.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.533
It's on a note, so...
We didn't say it.

01:13.533 --> 01:15.100
The note said it.
Yeah.

01:15.100 --> 01:18.300
Okay, you know what? I will pass
him.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.833
Oh, great.
Great, that was easy.

01:19.833 --> 01:21.900
After he earns the grade,
okay?

01:21.900 --> 01:23.467
I don't care if I have
to tutor him everyday...

01:23.467 --> 01:25.967
I will get him to pass
this class.

01:25.967 --> 01:27.700
Students are not a paycheck,
okay?

01:27.700 --> 01:28.833
Actually--

01:28.833 --> 01:31.267
Our students are the future.
Okay.

01:31.267 --> 01:33.233
They are of the future.

01:33.233 --> 01:34.900
And that's why Wahlburgers...

01:34.900 --> 01:36.767
Ssh, ssh, ssh...
is the best show in the world.

01:36.767 --> 01:37.733
Be quiet.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.067
ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
For the first match...

01:50.067 --> 01:51.767
we have Aaron Dwyer
fromCumbridge.

01:51.767 --> 01:53.367
What are we doing here again?

01:53.367 --> 01:55.733
Well, I'm here to meet this
Matt guy, and I don't--

01:55.733 --> 01:57.667
I don't know why you're here.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.633
Oh, I'm just kinda gettin'
into sports, I guess.

01:59.633 --> 02:01.133
ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
Who will be facing...

02:01.133 --> 02:02.300
EastWestern's Matthew Lee.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.633
Oh, that's him.
Oh, fan favorite.

02:04.633 --> 02:06.233
Very popular.
Yeah.

02:06.233 --> 02:08.067
What are they wearing?
They look like voo-doo dolls.

02:08.067 --> 02:10.133
Yeah, they look like they're
wearing hairnets...

02:10.133 --> 02:12.100
but on their faces.
Yeah.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.633
Ssh!
Oh, my gosh!

02:13.633 --> 02:16.700
Uh, this is not a library,
it's a sports match.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.667
So we can talk, we're having a
private conversation.

02:18.667 --> 02:20.400
Yeah, and kill yourself.
Ooh!

02:20.400 --> 02:21.933
REFEREE (OVER P.A.)
Pret?Allez!

02:21.933 --> 02:23.967
Oh! Trying to stab each other.
Wow.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.767
That's cool.
Yeah, sort of.

02:25.767 --> 02:27.100
Sword of.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.733
Oh, sword of!
I'm an American treasure.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.133
Oh, my god, they're so bendy.
So regal.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.733
Yeah, bendy.
Regal.

02:33.733 --> 02:34.733
Bendy.
Regal.

02:34.733 --> 02:36.167
They're so bendy.
Regal.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.767
Yeah.
Do you smell popcorn?

02:37.767 --> 02:39.133
I do.
I want popcorn.

02:39.133 --> 02:41.933
Can we get a popcorn?
This is very exciting.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.900
Go, Matt!
Get it, Matt! Get it!

02:43.900 --> 02:46.333
He is very good.
Yeah. I'm at every game.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.900
Oh, wait, I do have popcorn.
Look, it's in my butt pocket.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.600
They're warm, have some.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.900
Go EastWestern! Woo!
Woo!

02:53.900 --> 02:55.367
Get a E-W!

02:55.367 --> 02:57.367
This is totally my thing.
Oh, yeah, hell, yeah.

02:57.367 --> 02:58.733
We need more of whatever
the game is called!

02:58.733 --> 03:01.100
Fencing, this is fencing.
Fencing.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.200
Fencing.
Fencing.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.967
I painted a fence!
Fencing.

03:03.967 --> 03:05.933
Fencing! Fencing.
Fencing. Fencing.

03:05.933 --> 03:07.233
This is fencing.

03:07.233 --> 03:08.700
I don't think so...
that sounds weird.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.200
Ssh!
Who's-- ssh, back!

03:11.200 --> 03:13.267
Ssh, back!
Back! Who's ssh-ing?

03:13.267 --> 03:15.300
Who ssh?
Speak up!

03:15.300 --> 03:17.833
Ssh back.
You dropped your eaves.

03:17.833 --> 03:20.067
Eavesdropper.

03:21.933 --> 03:23.633
It's kinda like fighting
in the future.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.067
But like fighting in the past.

03:25.067 --> 03:26.533
Yeah, like--
Yeah.

03:26.533 --> 03:28.500
That was really good.
Thanks, it felt really natural.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.167
Yeah.
Oh, my god.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.933
Am I a good fencer?
Well, I don't-- okay.

03:32.933 --> 03:34.733
Oh my god, there he is!
There--

03:34.733 --> 03:36.367
I can smell the win.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

03:36.367 --> 03:39.500
Excuse me, Mr. Lee? Hi!

03:39.500 --> 03:42.567
I'm-- I'm Matt. I mean,
I'm Billie.

03:42.567 --> 03:46.067
And this is Matt.
No, I'm Gene, you're Matt.

03:46.067 --> 03:47.267
Huge fan.

03:47.267 --> 03:49.433
[FEMALE COED] Later, Mattress!
Later.

03:49.433 --> 03:52.700
Oh, what part of England
are you from?

03:52.700 --> 03:53.933
Hong Kong.

03:53.933 --> 03:57.367
Ah, John Lennon, the Monkees...
Rebel Wilson.

03:57.367 --> 04:00.900
I bet you know Hugh Jackman
personally.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.433
so...ctually your teacher, um,

04:03.433 --> 04:06.300
I think your coach spoke to
you about setting up tutoring?

04:06.300 --> 04:07.733
Yeah, I think-- I do
remember that.

04:07.733 --> 04:09.533
Great, because I want to say,
what I saw you do...

04:09.533 --> 04:12.167
with your sword, I'm gonna do
with your mind.

04:12.167 --> 04:16.467
I'm just gonna poke, poke, poke,
poke at your brains...

04:16.467 --> 04:20.133
with-- with my fact... wand.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.600
Wait, wait.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.067
Wh-- what was that?

04:25.067 --> 04:27.133
What?
Sorry, did you say Matt?

04:27.133 --> 04:28.600
I didn't hear anyone.
Guys...

04:28.600 --> 04:31.233
Me, either.
Guys, my team's calling me.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.800
Thanks for coming, yeah?
Really good to meet you. Cheers!

04:33.800 --> 04:36.900
Cheers!
Brexit like a boss.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.067
You okay? What happened there?
Oh, I don't know.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.467
I jus-- I--

04:40.467 --> 04:42.367
You should just work on talking
to people.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.733
Hah! On guard!
Hee-yah!

04:46.733 --> 04:48.200
I'm good at sound effects.
Gotcha!

04:48.200 --> 04:50.400
Agh, that kind of hurt.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.067
Sorry.
It's okay.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.300
Uh, sports are really cool.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.533
I wonder why they never really
caught on.

04:54.533 --> 04:56.367
Yeah, especially like the team
pride, you know?

04:56.367 --> 04:57.833
It's like, we're all fencing.
Yeah.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.333
Totally, it's bondage.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.733
You know what? I'm gonna get him
to pass my class, Gene.

05:01.733 --> 05:04.200
I won't let him, let him down.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.067
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel you.
( HORN HONKS )

05:06.067 --> 05:07.500
I'm totally listening,
but also...

05:07.500 --> 05:10.367
why has no one ever told me that
I'm meant to be a fencer?

05:10.367 --> 05:12.667
Like, I know what Morgan
Freeman feels like now...

05:12.667 --> 05:14.100
starting acting at 70.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.500
I'm like the Morgan Freeman
of fencing.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.700
I mean, I guess you could try
out for the team.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.633
What do you mean? Ilike,
am the team already.

05:19.633 --> 05:20.967
Okay, just don't get your
hopes up...

05:20.967 --> 05:22.100
before you've seen
what you can do.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.533
I have seen what I can do.
Where?

05:23.533 --> 05:25.067
In my brain!

05:25.067 --> 05:26.533
That-- you can't just snap your
fingers and be an athlete!

05:26.533 --> 05:27.867
( HORN HONKS )
You have to work at it.

05:27.867 --> 05:29.800
Like Matt's gonna have to work
to pass his test.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.067
( HORN HONKING )

05:31.067 --> 05:33.067
Everything starts out
as an idea, okay?

05:33.067 --> 05:34.667
( HONKING CONTINUES )
Baby names, buildings--

05:34.667 --> 05:36.333
Land Before Time sequals.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.500
but you're the kind of person...

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
that like will never turn it
into reality.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.600
And you know why? Because you
don't believe in yourself.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.733
I totally believe in myself. I'm
gonna be a [BLEEP]ing fencer.

05:44.733 --> 05:47.600
You know? Go EastWestern!
What?

05:47.600 --> 05:50.533
Agh! Ooh! Agh!

05:50.533 --> 05:53.700
I'm in pain! Ow!
Oh, my gosh, I am sorry.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.433
No! It's not your fault!

05:55.433 --> 06:01.167
Billie! You hit my ankle,
you bitch! Agh!

06:01.167 --> 06:04.433
Jousting was actually history's
first extreme sport...

06:04.433 --> 06:06.700
when you think about it, right?

06:06.700 --> 06:10.767
Speaking of sports, has anyone
seen Matthew Lee?

06:10.767 --> 06:13.533
From fencing team? Supposed
to be in this class, no?

06:13.533 --> 06:18.133
Never mind, he's not here,
and that's... fine.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.867
I'm sorry, I've been in an
accident, excuse me.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.233
[GENE] I'm so sorry.

06:26.233 --> 06:30.933
What are you doing in a scooter,
Gene? There's a--

06:30.933 --> 06:32.367
Great.

06:32.367 --> 06:36.433
I'm gonna sit right around--
like right there.

06:36.433 --> 06:39.233
Okay, start your lesson.
You bruised your ankle.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.833
I got hurt worse than you did!

06:40.833 --> 06:43.300
Where's Matt? Where is he?

06:43.300 --> 06:44.767
Is he okay? Everything--
Matt, he didn't show up.

06:44.767 --> 06:46.167
He hates direction.
He didn't show up.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.433
What? Matt?

06:48.433 --> 06:51.633
No. Matt!
Not here, Gene!

06:51.633 --> 06:54.433
Of course, he's not. For him,
the dream is still alive.

06:54.433 --> 06:57.800
Unlike for me, just a washed
up piece of crap...

06:57.800 --> 07:00.167
with a suitcase full
of should'ves...

07:00.167 --> 07:03.733
and what coulda happens,
and mighta beens.

07:03.733 --> 07:05.100
How do think I feel, huh?

07:05.100 --> 07:07.133
How am I gonna can't get him
to pass my class...

07:07.133 --> 07:08.833
if I can't even get him
to show up?

07:08.833 --> 07:12.100
Um, guys?
I gave my-- what?

07:12.100 --> 07:15.067
Can we um, learn?
Yeah.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.633
Uh, this just in, we were in an
accident.

07:17.633 --> 07:19.867
You're a rude girl. I'll reflect
that in your grade.

07:19.867 --> 07:21.767
This just in.
Do not sass me, Eduardo!

07:21.767 --> 07:23.633
Oh, my god. Out of my way!

07:23.633 --> 07:24.700
Where are you-- what are you
doin--

07:24.700 --> 07:26.167
Billie, watch out!

07:26.167 --> 07:27.567
Don't leave me here.
I just yelled at a student.

07:27.567 --> 07:29.200
I have to tell truths, Billie!

07:29.200 --> 07:31.367
Truths, plural?
All the truths!

07:31.367 --> 07:34.067
No, don't help me. It makes
me feel pathetic.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.333
You look pathetic.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.300
You look pathetic, babe.
You look pathetic, babe.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.367
Hey, toots, you look the most
pathetic!

07:39.367 --> 07:41.067
[GENE] Shit!

07:41.067 --> 07:43.300
Okay, I don't know what you're
doing, but just go for it!

07:43.300 --> 07:44.733
Wait, I got it.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.567
I got this! Hah-hah-hah!

07:49.567 --> 07:50.933
Sayonara!
All right.

07:53.267 --> 07:57.100
This is it... my new
second home.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.700
God, it feels good to be here
for the first time.

08:00.700 --> 08:01.933
Gene?

08:01.933 --> 08:05.133
Richie, just the man
I was looking for.

08:05.133 --> 08:07.100
The news station manager...

08:07.100 --> 08:09.367
slash, the person who hit me
with a van.

08:09.367 --> 08:11.500
Yeah, I want to apologize again
for that, by the way.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
Oh, my gosh, no need, no need.
All right?

08:13.500 --> 08:16.733
Take that apology and let's turn
it into an opportunity, okay?

08:16.733 --> 08:18.433
Follow me down this path.

08:18.433 --> 08:21.267
I've decided to do what all
great athletes do after their...

08:21.267 --> 08:24.100
professional careers are over,
and become a sports journalist.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.267
That's right. That's right.

08:27.267 --> 08:30.800
Hi. I'm your new broad...
caster.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.300
No, no.

08:32.300 --> 08:35.367
This is Gene on the Scene coming
to you live...

08:35.367 --> 08:38.300
from EastWestern University's
tournament of "Swords."

08:38.300 --> 08:40.400
You're doing this right now?
So, y'all know what that means.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.667
Gene? Gene?
Fencing fans.

08:41.667 --> 08:42.933
The cameras aren't even
plugged in.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.100
I know when they're on me.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.067
That's right, it's a sword
fight!

08:46.067 --> 08:50.267
A major poke-fest, starring
Matt "The Mattress" Lee...

08:50.267 --> 08:52.167
as he scored a touchdown.
Gene. Gene?

08:52.167 --> 08:54.533
Let's take it into overtime
with 15-love.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.067
Gene?
Yeah.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.867
I can't just give you the
position just because I hit you.

08:57.867 --> 08:59.767
I mean, my insurance already
covered your hospital bills...

08:59.767 --> 09:01.600
and this-- this Rascal...

09:01.600 --> 09:04.133
which I really don't think
you need.

09:04.133 --> 09:08.367
But you ruined my sports-- you
ruined my sports career.

09:08.367 --> 09:10.067
Okay, uh, look, Gene?

09:10.067 --> 09:14.267
If you want to work here,
you gotta bring me a story.

09:14.267 --> 09:17.500
Oh... one time, there was a
prince--

09:17.500 --> 09:19.400
No, no, no, I don't need you
to tell me a story right now.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.633
Oh.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.167
I need you to go out there
and get one.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.667
I see what you mean.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.600
I'm gonna bring you a story...

09:25.600 --> 09:27.700
and it's gonna be the best story
you've ever read.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.967
Even when you were a kid...

09:28.967 --> 09:30.900
and you got great stories
by your parents.

09:30.900 --> 09:34.467
It's gonna be better than that.
Peace out, no.

09:34.467 --> 09:35.833
Are you okay?
No, the je--

09:35.833 --> 09:37.500
Yeah, I'm fine.
The wheel is stuck.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.467
It's fine. This one's good,
that one's good.

09:41.467 --> 09:42.933
Yeah, we're good.

09:42.933 --> 09:44.500
This thing is a piece of shit,
by the way.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.400
I'm gonna need a better one...
and a make-up person.

09:47.400 --> 09:52.600
And uh, a raise, because
I'm a woman, and I deserve it.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.067
It's 2017.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.133
No, I knew you were
looking at me.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.033
Oh, please, whatever!

10:02.033 --> 10:04.533
In my head, I'm going,
"He doesn't even know my name."

10:04.533 --> 10:06.533
Oh really, Felicia?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.233
My name is Rachel.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.867
Hi, there!
Oh!

10:14.867 --> 10:18.333
I'm looking for Matt
the athlete?

10:18.333 --> 10:19.600
He's all yours.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.000
Bye, Felicia.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.100
Oh, bye, Felicia!

10:23.467 --> 10:24.800
Sorry.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.467
Pretty name, it means...
happiness.

10:27.467 --> 10:31.867
So, um, I was just in study hall
waiting for you.

10:31.867 --> 10:35.933
I waited for about an hour,
and then I was like...

10:35.933 --> 10:40.633
"Billie, are you sure...
that you told him about this?"

10:40.633 --> 10:42.100
So, I thought, "You know what?

10:42.100 --> 10:46.100
"Why don't I just make it easier
and just come to you."

10:46.100 --> 10:48.267
So, walla!

10:50.400 --> 10:52.500
I'm sorry, who are you?

10:52.500 --> 10:55.333
Oh, I'm your, uh-- I'm your
history teacher.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.800
Yeah, and look, I know you're
the star athlete...

10:57.800 --> 11:01.067
and you're used to all your
professors just passing you.

11:01.067 --> 11:04.633
But, uh, this Mattress just
got delivered to Browntown.

11:04.633 --> 11:08.067
Browntown is me, I'm Browntown.
What--

11:08.067 --> 11:11.533
I jus-- I've never had a teacher
invest in my future this way.

11:11.533 --> 11:13.667
Oh! Well, that's great.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.600
Too bad it's not for something
more practical...

11:15.600 --> 11:17.300
than medieval weaponry,
but whatever.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.367
Yeah.
Let's give it a go.

11:18.367 --> 11:19.567
Okay.
Agh...

11:19.567 --> 11:21.567
That's cool, cool--
cool, cool attitude.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.533
I brought you an extra book.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.367
Wow. Look at your wrist.

11:25.367 --> 11:27.333
Oh, yeah, I got ah...

11:27.333 --> 11:28.833
No, no, no.
...hit by a van.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.633
That should be bandaged.
Have you seen a doctor?

11:30.633 --> 11:34.667
No! No need, I got my trusty
crutches here...

11:34.667 --> 11:37.867
from my plantar's wart removal,
and I thought, "You know what?"

11:37.867 --> 11:39.667
Wow! Your knees are destroyed!
Something told me to hang on--

11:39.667 --> 11:44.967
Oh, eyes up here, Romeo.
I see what you're doing.

11:44.967 --> 11:46.467
Hi, can you connect me to
the Health Center, please?

11:46.467 --> 11:47.967
Okay.

11:47.967 --> 11:49.433
Yeah, yeah, I've got a professor
here in pretty bad shape.

11:49.433 --> 11:51.467
All right, okay.
Yes, I'll hold.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.633
Someone really doesn't want
to study.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.600
Uh, is that-- are you?
Just a little blood.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.367
Okay. That looks a little--
That's fine.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.333
You know what? It's more red
snot than blood.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.967
Yeah? It's-- okay.
No, I just--

12:02.967 --> 12:04.467
What's the altitude
in this room?

12:04.467 --> 12:05.667
It's sea level, same.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.500
I think it's just dry.
Okay, uh--

12:07.500 --> 12:10.267
Do you smell a burnt avocado?
Burnt-- burnt avocado?

12:10.267 --> 12:14.933
Mm.
Yes, please hurry.

12:14.933 --> 12:17.933
Coach? Coach?
Coach McLaughlin! Hi!

12:17.933 --> 12:20.133
Can I help you, miss?
Oh, Miss Brown.

12:20.133 --> 12:21.567
I could barely recognize you.

12:21.567 --> 12:24.200
I know, I had a little accident.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.700
I was actually on crutches...

12:25.700 --> 12:28.633
but Matt insisted I go to the
hospital, so I got this.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.800
Um, is he in there, by the way?

12:30.800 --> 12:33.233
Yes, but you cannot go
into the men's locker room.

12:33.233 --> 12:35.600
Oh, right, the penises.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.267
Um, well, I made him some
study sheets...

12:38.267 --> 12:39.433
because I didn't get a chance
to tutor him.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.067
Oh, great.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.967
Oh, and this is just a little
thank you for the hospital.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.467
Assortment of flavored nuts.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.833
I got barbeque, jalapeno.
Ah...

12:46.833 --> 12:48.767
Well, I'll pass them along.
Thank you.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.067
Did someone say pass?
I did.

12:51.067 --> 12:53.333
Roxie, play news stinger.
What's up, America?

12:53.333 --> 12:55.700
I'm here outside the men's
locker room...

12:55.700 --> 12:58.967
at EastWestern University, where
you just witnessed a coach...

12:58.967 --> 13:02.100
accepting gifts from a disabled
person.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.067
I'm not disabled.
Back to me.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.733
Not only is she a disabled
person...

13:05.733 --> 13:07.933
she's also a teacher here at
this very school.

13:07.933 --> 13:10.067
Also, this very coach--
go to him.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.467
Hey!
Has been putting pressure...

13:11.467 --> 13:13.867
on her to pass his star athlete,
Matthew Lee.

13:13.867 --> 13:15.267
Back to me.

13:15.267 --> 13:16.633
Also, Billie's having sex
with Matthew Lee.

13:16.633 --> 13:18.800
What? Ew.
What? No, no!

13:18.800 --> 13:21.167
All right, good, good! I deny
all of these allegations!

13:21.167 --> 13:23.167
All of them, denied!

13:23.167 --> 13:24.700
Sick.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.733
[GENE] Back to me, Hedra.
Gene, what are you doing?

13:26.733 --> 13:29.667
It seems there's a seedier
side to college sports...

13:29.667 --> 13:32.700
full of glad handing
and special favors.

13:32.700 --> 13:35.433
Hm, this seems like there's one
Mattress...

13:35.433 --> 13:37.667
that needs to be flipped.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.167
And cut and perfect.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.767
Oh, my god, you were totally
right.

13:40.767 --> 13:42.067
You really are an American
Treasure.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.067
I know.
Right?

13:43.067 --> 13:44.067
Yeah.
Exactly.

13:44.067 --> 13:46.100
No!
Gene!

13:46.100 --> 13:48.367
Oh, Billie, I am so sorry.

13:48.367 --> 13:49.733
You don't know anything
that's going on.

13:49.733 --> 13:52.233
I'm gonna be a college
broadcaster now.

13:52.233 --> 13:54.067
Sorta need a juicy story...

13:54.067 --> 13:56.233
something with meat on the
bones.

13:56.233 --> 13:57.833
And I'm the meat?

13:57.833 --> 13:59.767
Well?
Okay, look!

13:59.767 --> 14:02.167
I am not fodder for your sex
scandel, okay?

14:02.167 --> 14:05.933
I was here to teach Matt,
so he could pass fairly.

14:05.933 --> 14:09.533
And you cost him his study
sheets and his nuts!

14:09.533 --> 14:12.467
Study sheets or cheat sheets,
Billie?

14:12.467 --> 14:15.767
Study sh-- they were just
guiding--

14:15.767 --> 14:19.533
Look, what happened to your team
pride, anyway?

14:19.533 --> 14:22.300
What happened to my legs,
Billie?

14:22.300 --> 14:26.267
Nothing. I got hit, you just
stubbed your toe.

14:26.267 --> 14:27.767
What happened to my legs?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.167
The exam's in an hour.
You have to take it, too.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.833
Legs, Billie!

14:30.833 --> 14:33.633
Did you hear me about the test?
What happened to my legs?

14:37.100 --> 14:39.300
All right, guys, don't open 'em
up yet.

14:39.300 --> 14:43.600
We're gonna just wait, see if
anyone shows up late.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.067
Oh.

14:47.067 --> 14:49.067
Hey, man, why's everybody
got these tricked out bicycles?

14:49.067 --> 14:51.067
Just take a seat, Shane,
and mind your business.

14:51.067 --> 14:52.200
Thank you.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.200
Matt, hi!

14:54.200 --> 14:57.867
I'm sorry, am I late?
No, only technically.

14:57.867 --> 14:59.200
Come, have a seat.

15:00.700 --> 15:05.733
Look, I just want to say that
I'm-- sorry.

15:05.733 --> 15:08.200
Hey, I'm sorry that we never
got to study...

15:08.200 --> 15:10.333
or I never got you those study
sheets.

15:10.333 --> 15:11.900
It's fine.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.367
But just so you know my--
I'm not gonna just pass you.

15:14.367 --> 15:16.500
My moral compass doesn't
allow it.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.800
Don't worry, I got this.
Thanks, Matt.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.733
Preferential treatment abounds.

15:21.733 --> 15:23.267
All right, guys.

15:23.267 --> 15:26.900
Get out your pens and your
battle axes and uh...

15:26.900 --> 15:29.167
take your test.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.933
I don't have a battle ax.
Just use your pen.

15:31.933 --> 15:32.967
Oh.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.600
( SNORING )

15:37.600 --> 15:39.167
Fencing!

15:40.967 --> 15:42.533
Better get going and grade
these papers...

15:42.533 --> 15:44.433
before the big game, teach.

15:46.367 --> 15:48.067
Did you get a faster Rascal?

15:48.067 --> 15:50.400
Yes, it's like I always
say, live fast, die slow.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.333
That's a terrible plan.

15:55.433 --> 15:58.667
Okay, please be good,
please be good, please be good.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.367
Oh, god.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.367
Mm--

16:29.100 --> 16:30.233
Eh--

16:33.833 --> 16:35.367
Yeah, okay.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.500
It seems like there's one
Mattress...

16:39.500 --> 16:43.067
that needs to be flipped.

16:43.067 --> 16:46.100
We added the explosion
in after, for effect.

16:46.100 --> 16:50.233
I wanted to do it live, but I'd
have a major case of hot face.

16:50.233 --> 16:53.767
Gene, look, this piece is
totally slanted...

16:53.767 --> 16:57.067
it lacks in-depth reporting,
it has no sources...

16:57.067 --> 16:59.567
and it makes outrageous claims.

16:59.567 --> 17:03.667
It's what we in the news world
like to call... perfect.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.233
Oh, my gosh.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.333
Thought you were gonna go a
different way with that. Wow!

17:07.333 --> 17:09.367
Thank you! I felt really
good about it.

17:09.367 --> 17:11.933
Like a regular Barb Walters.

17:11.933 --> 17:13.533
So you wanna just give me
my press badge...

17:13.533 --> 17:15.200
and I'll head off
to the big match?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.500
Yeah, unfortunately I can't
do that.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.100
What's up?

17:19.100 --> 17:21.733
Your GPA... it's too low.
Your exam grades were posted.

17:21.733 --> 17:27.167
What? She failed me...
and passed Matt!

17:27.167 --> 17:30.067
Oh, that bitch!

17:38.067 --> 17:40.933
Oh, that bitch!

17:46.400 --> 17:47.900
Hi, Gene, I can't talk
right now.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.467
Oh, are you in a hurry, on the
way to the big match?

17:50.467 --> 17:51.900
Yeah, actually, I am.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.067
Oh, that bitch!

17:54.067 --> 17:55.233
What?

17:55.233 --> 17:56.700
You posted our grades online,
Billie!

17:56.700 --> 17:58.900
I saw that you passed Matt,
even though he failed.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.433
How did you know--

18:00.433 --> 18:04.367
Because I let him copy off of me
and he passed and I failed!

18:04.367 --> 18:06.133
And now I can't be the
Bob Costas of the school...

18:06.133 --> 18:07.600
because my GPA is so low.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.067
And it's all your fault,
you stupid bitch!

18:10.067 --> 18:11.633
Roxie, play death metal.

18:11.633 --> 18:16.667
Gene, wait! Stop circling me,
Gene, I am going to tell them!

18:16.667 --> 18:20.100
Will you shut off your
dance club music? Thank you.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.767
Look, I know what I did was
wrong.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.767
I'm going right now to tell
the truth! Will you--

18:23.767 --> 18:26.433
Roxie, play death metal!
I'm going to tell the truth!

18:26.433 --> 18:28.067
Will you turn that off!

18:28.067 --> 18:30.067
Gene, would you turn that off,
please!

18:30.067 --> 18:31.567
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
What?

18:31.567 --> 18:33.100
I said I'm going right now...

18:33.100 --> 18:34.600
Yeah?
...to stop it.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.533
I'm going to tell the coach...
Roxie, death metal!

18:35.533 --> 18:37.300
...and the dean that he failed.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.067
Will you stop being such a baby!

18:39.067 --> 18:40.500
Oh, I'm a baby?

18:40.500 --> 18:43.667
You had no problem failing
this baby, did you, Billie?

18:43.667 --> 18:46.467
That's because I expect more
from you, Gene!

18:46.467 --> 18:48.133
Plus, you let him cheat!

18:48.133 --> 18:51.667
Me cheats?
Yeah, you cheats.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.833
You cheat, sweets.
Yeah, you cheat, sweets.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.633
You cheat!
Eat sweet-- take cheats!

18:55.633 --> 18:56.867
You cheat!
You cheat! Sweep streets!

18:56.867 --> 18:58.067
Hey, give me that.
Give me that, Hand!

18:58.067 --> 18:59.200
This is the only thing I
learned...

18:59.200 --> 19:00.700
No!
...in your stupid class, Billie!

19:00.700 --> 19:02.900
The joust!
No! No! Stop!

19:02.900 --> 19:05.300
This isn't fair, your Rascal's
way faster than mine!

19:05.300 --> 19:07.067
Oh, yeah, you're right,
I'll handicap myself.

19:07.067 --> 19:10.667
No, you have a metal flag pole!
This is crazy!

19:10.667 --> 19:13.067
Hey, you! Gimme this!

19:13.067 --> 19:14.567
Hey, that's my hand, man.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.333
Relax, Shane, I'll give it back.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.333
Do you guys not have anything
more battle-worthy than a--

19:19.333 --> 19:20.967
Never mind.
How do you know my name?

19:20.967 --> 19:24.467
You're in my class, you idiot!
You have very sweaty hands.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.767
Live fast, die slow, bitch!

19:26.767 --> 19:28.700
That doesn't make any sense,
bitch!

19:28.700 --> 19:30.067
I need my flag.

19:30.067 --> 19:32.300
Agh!
Agh!

19:32.300 --> 19:36.300
Agh!
Agh!

19:37.200 --> 19:39.967
Agh!
Agh!

19:39.967 --> 19:43.100
Agh!
Agh!

19:43.100 --> 19:44.800
These things are really
[BLEEP]ing slow!

19:44.800 --> 19:46.067
Very frustrating.
Yeah.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.300
Stop!

19:47.300 --> 19:49.567
Hedra, we're in the
middle of a scooter joust.

19:49.567 --> 19:51.067
Well, haven't you guys heard
the news?

19:51.067 --> 19:54.267
Matthew Lee can't compete.
He fell on his sword.

19:54.267 --> 19:55.800
Figuratively or literally?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.400
No, he dropped his equipment and
when he went to pick it up...

19:57.400 --> 19:59.500
he got hit by a van.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.800
It's an epidemic.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.300
Really, I mean, are these
walking streets?

20:02.300 --> 20:03.433
Are they driving streets?

20:03.433 --> 20:05.400
This school needs better
signage. Hello!

20:05.400 --> 20:09.200
Hey! I want my hand and
The Hand wants its flag.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.467
Not until the joust is done!

20:10.467 --> 20:12.733
Agh!
( ENGINE WHIRS DOWN )

20:13.733 --> 20:15.000
Agh!

20:15.000 --> 20:16.167
Your battery-- your battery's
dead.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.400
The joust is done.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.300
My lady.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.567
I'm very much a man.

20:22.567 --> 20:25.833
Which answers the age old
question: Which came first?

20:27.133 --> 20:29.233
The vomitorium, of course.

20:29.233 --> 20:30.900
Matt, do you have a question?

20:30.900 --> 20:33.233
Nope, again, it's just the cast.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.167
Right, okay.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.967
So this would change the way...
And last but not least...

20:36.967 --> 20:38.200
Lisa Kudrow.
...battles were fought.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.300
What are you doing?

20:39.300 --> 20:41.433
Now it's the cast of Friends.

20:41.433 --> 20:42.667
Now who can tell me the
difference...

20:42.667 --> 20:45.100
between a moat and a sluice?

20:45.100 --> 20:47.033
Oh.
Matt, you wanna...

20:47.033 --> 20:48.300
take a stab at this?

20:48.300 --> 20:49.867
Yeah, I think Gunther can get
this one!

20:49.867 --> 20:51.867
Dude, his hand's up,
'cause he's in a cast.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.233
Oh, my god.

20:53.233 --> 20:54.867
Shane, don't talk out of turn,
please.

20:54.867 --> 20:57.300
Raise your hand like Matt.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.733
S'good, Billie... that bitch.

21:00.733 --> 21:02.633
[BILLIE] Take a... train!
[GENE] Train!

21:10.100 --> 21:11.600
I mean, which way is rev--

21:12.833 --> 21:14.267
Which way is rev-- hold on!

21:14.267 --> 21:16.467
This is an accident waiting
to happen.

21:21.900 --> 21:22.267
No.
