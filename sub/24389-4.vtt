00:19.019 --> 00:21.730
<i>I've raced helicopters,
I've raced jet planes.</i>

00:21.813 --> 00:24.213
<i>I don't know what's out there for me,
but I want to be ready.</i>

00:24.399 --> 00:27.239
<i>I like being the underdog.
My whole life, I've been the underdog.</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:30.632
<i>I think that's where the whole sleeper
thing really attracts to me the most.</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:32.448
<i>I'm definitely known as Turbo Tony.</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:35.661
<i>I'm doing this race to prove
that a low-buck car</i>

00:35.744 --> 00:38.121
<i>can race a supercar and run with it.</i>

00:38.330 --> 00:39.957
<i>The adrenaline rush is insane.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.668
<i>You're doing something that's dangerous.
You know, you could die.</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:45.563
- Dude, that thing looks ridiculous.
- Look, you can see her ass.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.006
So, I'm gonna put my roof on,
'cause if you beat me,

00:48.090 --> 00:50.717
I don't want pieces of your car
flying at me.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.030
<i>I don't really see the Lambo
having a bunch of a shot with us three.</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.723
What the hell is that?

00:56.807 --> 00:58.934
<i>Most people don't like to race me.</i>

00:59.101 --> 01:00.581
<i>I'll do whatever I have to do to win.</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:03.188
<i>If you're driving a Lamborghini Aventador,</i>

01:03.272 --> 01:05.315
<i>everybody expects you to win.</i>

01:05.399 --> 01:08.068
<i>And if you don't, that's humiliating.</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:26.837
<i>I always liked cars, and I liked art</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:29.965
<i>and after college,
I wanted to something really creative.</i>

01:30.048 --> 01:34.052
It was just so horrifying to think
that I would have a regular job.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.681
<i>I just wanted to do something different.</i>

01:38.181 --> 01:41.310
And I said, "I don't know what I'd be.
King of the world? Is that a thing?"

01:42.185 --> 01:45.564
<i>My dad said, "You can do anything you want
on your spare time,</i>

01:45.689 --> 01:48.317
<i>but make money through a real career."</i>

01:48.525 --> 01:50.110
<i>My parents didn't have any money.</i>

01:50.485 --> 01:53.572
So, for him, a real career
was law, medicine or plumbing.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.741
<i>So, I chose law.</i>

01:56.408 --> 01:59.369
<i>I became a divorce lawyer
to please my dad.</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:01.246
<i>But then on weekends,</i>

02:01.330 --> 02:04.291
<i>I like to really let loose
with the rally cars.</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:08.127
<i>The Lamborghini has more style
than any other car.</i>

02:08.336 --> 02:09.880
<i>You can be the king of the world.</i>

02:18.180 --> 02:21.642
<i>I'm probably the only person who thinks
that a Lamborghini's understated.</i>

02:22.267 --> 02:24.227
<i>So, I customized the car.</i>

02:25.228 --> 02:27.606
<i>Everything I owned, I always customize.</i>

02:27.939 --> 02:29.691
<i>So, shoes, suits, everything,</i>

02:29.775 --> 02:32.486
<i>I want it to be an expression
of creativity.</i>

02:32.694 --> 02:33.779
Ready? Up.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.197
<i>These Lamborghinis,</i>

02:35.322 --> 02:40.869
<i>no one would dare to take a brand-new car
and re-invent it as a very flashy car.</i>

02:42.412 --> 02:45.332
If you can just chrome everything,
I would. Everything looks better shiny.

02:46.792 --> 02:53.006
<i>Right now, I own a 2016 Lamborghini
Aventador Roadster Superveloce.</i>

02:53.131 --> 02:54.675
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.511
<i>It's got a 12-cylinder engine.</i>

02:57.594 --> 03:02.432
<i>It now has about 800 horsepower
with the factory exhaust tunes,</i>

03:02.599 --> 03:05.060
<i>and it has almost every single option.</i>

03:05.894 --> 03:09.356
I think the price
for this was 725,000 dollars.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.483
This is the only car ever like this,
isn't it?

03:11.566 --> 03:14.027
Yeah. You know how you can tell?
Check this out.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.697
Over here...

03:17.739 --> 03:21.368
there is... a plate that says
it was made just for me.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.161
<i>Life is art.</i>

03:23.745 --> 03:25.747
Or at least my life is art.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.809
Holy shit, it does have your name
right in there.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.435
- Yeah.
- That's freaking awesome.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.878
They had... they had one that said
"Made for Jackie Chan",

03:31.962 --> 03:35.674
and I know Jackie, and fuck him.
So, I made it specially made for me.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.301
<i>People want to interact with it.</i>

03:38.385 --> 03:41.346
It's a spaceship
on the streets of New York.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.806
Looking good!

03:44.558 --> 03:46.226
She looks good in that car, right?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.938
I like the attention.
It makes me happy,

03:50.272 --> 03:52.632
because it makes me feel like
I did a good job with the car.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.403
- You just stopped in tonight?
- We do this every... every weekend.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.089
But, you know,
we go all across the country.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.573
The only way I have fun

03:59.698 --> 04:01.783
is to go and do different things
with the cars.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.078
Yeah, it's a wonderful life.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.206
You see the smiles.
You also see the opposite.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.793
You have people who look like
why would they ever do that to a car?

04:11.877 --> 04:14.629
I almost threw up in my mouth.
I can't un-see it.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.733
All the negative and all the positive.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.426
As long as it impacts someone...

04:20.469 --> 04:21.720
Make a statement!

04:23.138 --> 04:26.641
<i>I would be humiliated
if I get my doors blown</i>

04:26.725 --> 04:28.268
by a station wagon,

04:28.602 --> 04:30.020
or an ice cream truck,

04:30.103 --> 04:31.743
or whatever the heck this sleeper car is.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.398
<i>But you know what?</i>

04:33.482 --> 04:35.358
<i>When I go home,
I'm gonna be looking good</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:37.444
while you get that crap
back to your house.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.876
<i>Back in the end of high school,
I started getting into racing,</i>

04:52.959 --> 04:54.711
<i>and a lot of people don't understand</i>

04:54.878 --> 04:56.713
<i>that if you built a car
and you win a race,</i>

04:56.797 --> 04:58.507
<i>it's like no other feeling in the world.</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:00.485
<i>You've got a crowd of people
surrounding you,</i>

05:00.509 --> 05:01.843
<i>you've got cops behind you.</i>

05:01.927 --> 05:04.887
You know, you're doing something
that's dangerous. You know, you could die.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.809
<i>But when we're in the driver's seat,
ready to make the pass,</i>

05:08.934 --> 05:11.144
<i>the adrenaline rush is insane.</i>

05:11.228 --> 05:13.814
And that's why I like to street race
so much.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.984
<i>My car is a third-gen Camaro.</i>

05:18.068 --> 05:20.153
<i>It's a small block, small tire car.</i>

05:20.821 --> 05:23.114
<i>It's a nitrous car, and it's a sleeper.</i>

05:24.032 --> 05:25.992
<i>Under the hood, it has the best
of the best,</i>

05:26.076 --> 05:28.370
<i>the electronics, the fuel system,</i>

05:29.037 --> 05:31.039
<i>but the outside of the car
looks like shit,</i>

05:31.248 --> 05:32.749
<i>so we called it the Shitbox.</i>

05:37.838 --> 05:40.340
<i>A fast car is only
as good as its team,</i>

05:40.507 --> 05:42.187
<i>and a lot of people don't understand that.</i>

05:43.969 --> 05:46.805
<i>You know, a good team helps
make the car better.</i>

05:48.974 --> 05:51.142
<i>And Team Shitbox is very solid.</i>

05:53.103 --> 05:54.372
- What are you doing?
- Me?

05:54.396 --> 05:55.748
- Yeah, bro.
- I'm here for...

05:55.772 --> 05:58.066
- Moral support?
- I need a nap, bro.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.693
I know you got my six, bro.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.695
Here you go, high five.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.906
<i>I've met my best friends and my crew
because of racing.</i>

06:04.990 --> 06:06.199
That is not a high five.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.953
<i>We also get to enjoy, you know,
hanging out.</i>

06:10.537 --> 06:13.665
<i>You know, we get to go to car shows,
we have big barbecues,</i>

06:13.832 --> 06:15.041
<i>we go on vacations together.</i>

06:15.584 --> 06:19.129
<i>We help each other,
and we all trust each other very well.</i>

06:19.379 --> 06:21.298
<i>That's a big thing about us.</i>

06:21.882 --> 06:25.176
It's not just... being a team.
It's almost being family.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.306
This is actually a picture of me
and my dad when I was a little baby.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.975
<i>My dad's always had Camaros.</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:35.145
<i>When he passed away
when I was 13 years old,</i>

06:35.604 --> 06:38.940
that was a very tough time,
because, you know,

06:40.650 --> 06:43.445
<i>growing up, you know,
especially during high school,</i>

06:43.653 --> 06:45.093
<i>if you don't have a dad, you know...</i>

06:45.739 --> 06:48.491
<i>Those are the years
you kind of learn the most,</i>

06:48.617 --> 06:50.535
<i>you know, about life in general.</i>

06:51.161 --> 06:53.830
And did not have my dad.
I had to kind of learn my own way.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.333
Where's the drill?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.420
<i>The car's kind of, you know,
helped me through, you know,</i>

07:01.254 --> 07:03.465
<i>the depression of losing my dad.</i>

07:04.549 --> 07:06.509
I just wish I was able to...

07:07.052 --> 07:08.178
to know him longer.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.029
This is a picture of my dad in the Navy.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.350
He was 18 here, or 17.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.894
As you can see,
there's a little bit of a resemblance.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.606
<i>My dad actually gave me my first Camaro.
I was 9 years old,</i>

07:19.731 --> 07:22.317
<i>and I learned a lot about automotive,</i>

07:22.567 --> 07:24.945
<i>and I also built my own engines.</i>

07:25.195 --> 07:28.740
<i>I always wanted more Camaros
to play around on and build them.</i>

07:29.074 --> 07:32.953
<i>So, every time I saw a good deal on one,
if I could afford it, I would buy it.</i>

07:33.036 --> 07:35.372
<i>I've had 35 of them.</i>

07:36.164 --> 07:39.084
<i>And that's because I used to part them out
to make money</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:42.212
<i>to be able to build my project car,
which is the Camaro I'll be racing.</i>

07:43.672 --> 07:46.466
<i>I kind of do everything to impress my dad.</i>

07:48.259 --> 07:49.678
<i>Every time I race, I get to think,</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:52.013
<i>"Oh, if I win, he's there watching,
you know?"</i>

07:53.264 --> 07:55.684
Even though he's not here...
if he's watching.

07:57.394 --> 08:01.064
<i>Everything I do
is to make sure he's proud.</i>

08:09.572 --> 08:12.283
My car is a '92 Plymouth Colt.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.077
I swapped with a 4G 6.3 engine

08:14.202 --> 08:16.413
out of a '91 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

08:17.372 --> 08:20.250
It's loud and obnoxious, kind of like me.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.630
Prior to modifying it, its max speed
was only 82 miles an hour.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.882
Like, I couldn't get it
to go any better than that.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.761
I love cars that look like shit.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.811
<i>I have 14 cars, which is a lot.</i>

08:40.020 --> 08:43.063
<i>But my Colt is absolutely my favorite car.</i>

08:43.565 --> 08:46.526
<i>And I just knew
that after I had done my touches to it,</i>

08:46.609 --> 08:49.320
<i>that it could be a monster.
And that's exactly what it is.</i>

08:54.159 --> 08:59.956
<i>The car runs in a quarter of a mile
9.8 seconds, 157 miles an hour.</i>

09:00.623 --> 09:02.167
<i>This car's a true sleeper.</i>

09:02.375 --> 09:03.877
<i>If it was quiet, it'd be even better.</i>

09:03.960 --> 09:05.795
<i>But the exhaust was so crappy,</i>

09:06.004 --> 09:07.564
it fell off and I never put it back on.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.971
I love my Colt so much 'cause it's like
family to me at this point.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.075
I've gone through some really bad times
in my life with this car,

09:18.099 --> 09:19.659
and the car helped me get through that.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.314
<i>Growing up, family life wasn't great.
My dad, he just wasn't a father.</i>

09:24.397 --> 09:26.608
<i>And he wasn't really involved in my life
that much.</i>

09:28.068 --> 09:29.308
<i>My parents smoked in the house,</i>

09:29.444 --> 09:31.284
<i>and I went to school
smelling like a cigarette.</i>

09:31.404 --> 09:34.324
So, I would be the smelly kid,
and, like, wouldn't have much money,

09:34.407 --> 09:35.909
so, clothes were on the back burner.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.112
I'd always wear the same stuff
all the time, you know?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.163
<i>We didn't have a lot of food, you know,</i>

09:40.538 --> 09:43.416
<i>so you're concerned more about eating
than what you look like.</i>

09:44.334 --> 09:47.670
Cars are an outlet for people
that get over things,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.839
and just pass some time.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.633
<i>Cars are just...</i>

09:52.050 --> 09:53.551
<i>it was like an escape from reality,</i>

09:53.676 --> 09:56.304
<i>like, the best way to, to describe it
when I was a kid,</i>

09:56.429 --> 09:58.264
<i>just 'cause that's all I had.</i>

09:58.640 --> 09:59.766
<i>I knew nothing.</i>

10:00.183 --> 10:02.644
<i>So, I went to the library
and literally rented a book</i>

10:02.727 --> 10:06.272
<i>on how to take an engine apart
and read it.</i>

10:06.648 --> 10:08.608
<i>I was just like,
"Wow, I can actually do this.</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:11.277
<i>I can actually take an engine apart
and assemble it</i>

10:11.361 --> 10:12.695
<i>and actually know it can work.</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:14.989
Now I've got to figure out
how to make it faster."

10:16.157 --> 10:18.159
<i>If you were in high school with me
back in the day,</i>

10:18.284 --> 10:22.038
<i>you'd be like, "Wow, he actually made it.
He did all right, you know?"</i>

10:22.914 --> 10:25.667
Having this garage and being able to call
everything here mine

10:25.959 --> 10:27.544
is pretty nice, you know?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.421
<i>It doesn't come overnight,
and it definitely comes from</i>

10:30.797 --> 10:33.383
<i>just being dirty as hell
at 02:30 in the morning,</i>

10:33.633 --> 10:36.553
<i>working on a fricking piece-of-shit car</i>

10:36.845 --> 10:38.805
<i>that shouldn't even be on the road
to begin with,</i>

10:38.930 --> 10:41.349
- just trying to make ends meet.
- How was work today?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.601
- Good, busy.
- Yeah?

10:43.685 --> 10:44.978
- It's always busy.
- Yeah.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.689
The hustle with street racing
is difficult,

10:48.273 --> 10:51.151
<i>and luckily, obviously,
my girlfriend lets me do whatever I want.</i>

10:51.276 --> 10:52.902
I got this race coming up on Tuesday.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.656
I'm gonna be racing
a Lamborghini Aventador SV.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.076
- The car is 800,000 dollars.
- 800,000 dollars?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.453
Yeah. Odds are he has a very small penis.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.417
And... there's two other sleepers as well.
Probably win.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.061
- I always win. You know that.
- You always win.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.795
I am definitely known as Turbo Tony.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.260
A hundred percent, that is my nickname.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.723
<i>I like being the underdog.
My whole life, I've been the underdog.</i>

11:22.223 --> 11:25.223
<i>I think that's where the whole sleeper
thing really attracts to me the most,</i>

11:25.268 --> 11:27.228
<i>is just having that sense of...</i>

11:28.104 --> 11:30.190
<i>"You're not supposed to be doing this,
but you are."</i>

11:30.773 --> 11:32.609
<i>And it's just bad-ass
that you're doing it.</i>

11:34.402 --> 11:37.447
<i>The racing's important to me
because these guys own these cars</i>

11:37.572 --> 11:40.909
worth literally 100 times
what your whole investment is worth.

11:40.992 --> 11:44.032
You know, they're doing something right
in their life to be where they're at.

11:44.329 --> 11:47.040
I just want a small piece of how they feel

11:47.415 --> 11:49.375
for... even if it's only ten seconds.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.907
<i>I'm definitely
a very mechanical person.</i>

12:02.931 --> 12:04.474
<i>I love knowing how things work.</i>

12:04.557 --> 12:06.517
<i>And I've always just had a passion
for cars.</i>

12:12.774 --> 12:15.193
<i>The truck I'll be racing is a 1984 C10.</i>

12:15.443 --> 12:17.362
<i>It has a stock-style fuel injection,</i>

12:17.528 --> 12:19.239
<i>4L 80 overdrive transmission.</i>

12:20.990 --> 12:23.993
<i>I couldn't begin to tell you
the amount of hours...</i>

12:24.786 --> 12:27.163
<i>that everybody has worked on this truck,</i>

12:27.830 --> 12:31.209
<i>from my dad, to me,
to my friends helping me with it.</i>

12:32.794 --> 12:36.297
<i>My favorite part with driving the truck
and it looking like a piece of crap</i>

12:36.506 --> 12:39.300
<i>is... nobody assumes that it's quick.</i>

12:42.470 --> 12:46.140
<i>The truck makes
roughly around 700 horse on...</i>

12:46.641 --> 12:48.226
<i>14-15 pounds of boost.</i>

12:49.894 --> 12:51.604
<i>The truck is a sleeper, because...</i>

12:52.105 --> 12:54.941
<i>anybody can build a Mustang
or a Camaro and make it fast.</i>

12:55.525 --> 12:59.821
To make a 4000-pound brick wall fast
is... pretty impressive in my book.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.203
<i>I knew the basic idea,
what I wanted to do to the truck.</i>

13:07.328 --> 13:10.456
<i>And then about four years ago,
I started getting parts together,</i>

13:10.748 --> 13:14.585
<i>this piece here, this piece there.
But everything was used, junkyard parts.</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:18.965
<i>It has a 700-dollar junkyard motor
with 74,000 miles on it.</i>

13:19.173 --> 13:20.484
<i>I decided I wanted to do twin turbos.</i>

13:20.508 --> 13:23.970
<i>I just thought it would be cooler-looking
to have PO2 turbos underneath the hood.</i>

13:24.470 --> 13:27.223
Everything's been cut, fit, and made
in the shop.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.858
<i>I'm usually out of the house
by 05:30, 06:00, every morning.</i>

13:37.317 --> 13:39.694
<i>I'm home by 2:30, 3:00.</i>

13:39.944 --> 13:42.064
<i>Get my kids off the school bus
when they're in school.</i>

13:42.322 --> 13:44.949
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, babe. How was your day?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.951
- All right, how was yours?
- It was good.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.456
<i>Me and my wife,
we've been together for 21 years now.</i>

13:52.040 --> 13:53.791
- What's up, you two?
- Nothing.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.044
<i>The drive to race</i>

13:56.127 --> 13:58.588
<i>definitely went away
after the kids were born.</i>

13:58.921 --> 14:02.175
<i>It wasn't a priority for me to be in a car
and going down the drag strip.</i>

14:02.383 --> 14:04.719
It was more wanting to spend time
with my wife and kids.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.388
- What are you drawing, Taylor?
- A person.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.639
- A person?
- Yeah.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.950
- Looks good.
- Thanks.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.287
<i>When my twins were born,
they were premature,</i>

14:13.311 --> 14:14.562
<i>they were seven weeks early.</i>

14:15.021 --> 14:17.190
<i>They spent roughly a month in NICU.</i>

14:17.315 --> 14:19.108
<i>That was a very trying time for us.</i>

14:19.359 --> 14:22.111
Having kids,
it's a life-changing experience.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.239
<i>My twins are now almost 11 years old.</i>

14:25.656 --> 14:27.784
<i>With me growing up
with my dad and my mom,</i>

14:27.867 --> 14:30.036
<i>how close I am with them,
I want that with my kids.</i>

14:30.119 --> 14:31.746
<i>I enjoy being around my kids.</i>

14:32.413 --> 14:34.999
<i>It's awesome hearing them
call you "Dad" or "Daddy."</i>

14:35.625 --> 14:36.985
I wouldn't trade it for the world.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.837
<i>Usually sit, eat dinner,</i>

14:40.004 --> 14:43.424
and I'm usually at the race car shop
till nine, ten o'clock every night.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.951
All right, I'll get underneath of this
and do this oil change.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.015
Grab that filler wrench.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.935
<i>Growing up,
my dad was always working on cars.</i>

14:54.185 --> 14:57.397
<i>I was always out there helping him,
trying to put stuff together with them,</i>

14:57.980 --> 15:00.900
<i>testing cars when we first started
really driving them a lot.</i>

15:01.442 --> 15:04.362
<i>So, it's always been a common ground
for me and my dad to work together.</i>

15:05.113 --> 15:08.699
<i>I still get amazed to this day,
watching him figure out a new roll cage,</i>

15:08.783 --> 15:10.493
<i>or a new back end for a race car.</i>

15:11.035 --> 15:12.096
If we get this oil changed,

15:12.120 --> 15:13.920
maybe we can do
a set of plugs in it too, Dad?

15:14.497 --> 15:16.577
<i>He did a really good job on that truck.</i>

15:16.749 --> 15:19.794
<i>Of course, he picked up on everything.
He watched me do a lot of stuff.</i>

15:20.711 --> 15:22.630
<i>And okay, there's mistakes along the way.</i>

15:22.755 --> 15:25.355
<i>There's stumbling blocks and everything,
and that's how you learn.</i>

15:25.383 --> 15:27.743
And that's how I learned,
and my dad taught me the same way.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.197
We'll check and make sure turbo,
all the V-bands are good.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.681
Check the header bolts too.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.852
<i>I want to do the race
because I want to prove to my dad</i>

15:35.935 --> 15:40.398
<i>that we can put something together
low-budget and it can run with a supercar.</i>

15:49.574 --> 15:53.411
<i>So... I got this race coming up
on Tuesday.</i>

15:53.995 --> 15:57.957
Two other sleeper cars
and a Lamborghini Aventador supercar.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.186
Well, the only car you should worry about
is the other two sleepers, probably.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.378
That's exactly how I feel.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.173
I feel the sleepers are more important
than the supercar.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.276
<i>Supercars are something,
I like to look at them,</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:08.540
<i>like I think anybody else does,</i>

16:09.135 --> 16:11.137
but they're not all
they're cracked up to be.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.847
The maintenance, the money.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.825
<i>At the end of the day,
there's other cars out there</i>

16:14.849 --> 16:16.889
<i>that are actually more well-built
than most of them.</i>

16:16.976 --> 16:20.313
We got to do the injectors.
The injectors are probably 15 years old.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.316
It's all rust.
It literally is full of rust.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.186
All right.
Let's get some new injectors in here.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.715
We're changing out the injectors
just 'cause they're old,

16:29.739 --> 16:33.326
so putting a bigger set of injectors in
so we can run more power

16:33.409 --> 16:34.702
to get down the track,

16:34.911 --> 16:36.245
and tear apart these other cars.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.624
And this car, for what it is,
you can put a hurt on people.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.919
<i>Yeah, the Lambo is not the problem
in this equation.</i>

16:43.085 --> 16:45.022
<i>Just 'cause you got money
doesn't mean you're fast.</i>

16:45.046 --> 16:46.839
<i>I know some supercar owners
that are actually</i>

16:47.006 --> 16:48.841
<i>the most down-to-earth people
you've ever met.</i>

16:49.008 --> 16:51.888
<i>But also know some that are the biggest
assholes you've ever met as well.</i>

16:52.136 --> 16:54.680
I guess it all depends on the situation.

17:08.944 --> 17:09.987
The bullpen.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.031
The bullpen houses the bull.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.867
It's a working garage.
There's nothing fancy here.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.868
I drive my car all the time.

17:16.953 --> 17:20.498
I drive it 12 months out of the year,
seven days out of the week.

17:20.580 --> 17:24.835
I've done 30,000 miles on that car.
So, this is a working garage,

17:25.002 --> 17:27.421
and I don't think anything but Lambos
can park here.

17:27.964 --> 17:31.592
I keep the Bentley, it's a placeholder
for the next Lambo that's coming.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.594
And the next Lambo that's coming?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.346
Beyond belief.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.975
They're protected by the eagle.
This came off a castle.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.728
I always liked it. It's predatory.
It could have cameras on it.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.815
It could have motion detectors.
It could have a license plate reader.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.818
When I hit 50, 50th birthday,

17:48.901 --> 17:51.153
I said the only thing I don't have
is a dinosaur.

17:51.654 --> 17:52.738
So, now I have a dinosaur.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.367
What the neighbors think would be
in the "I don't give a fuck" file.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.119
<i>Some people say,</i>

17:58.327 --> 18:01.038
"Wow", you know?
"It seems like you don't give a fuck."

18:01.163 --> 18:03.040
And that's because I really don't.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.044
Wow. And here it is.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.297
This is the wall of fame.
And you know what?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.090
These are the best moments of my life.

18:13.050 --> 18:18.014
For example, right here,
this was me racing a Cobra helicopter.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.475
<i>That helicopter went 185 miles an hour.</i>

18:21.767 --> 18:23.853
<i>I went 204. I won that one.</i>

18:24.604 --> 18:27.940
Very few people get front page,
above the fold

18:28.107 --> 18:30.067
of a major metropolitan paper.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.403
And we didn't have to kill anyone
to do it.

18:33.529 --> 18:38.826
The tour of Italy. You had to be selected,
and I was car number 34.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.077
Very special.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.164
<i>Racing... the world's best sleeper cars,</i>

18:43.331 --> 18:44.790
<i>I have more skin in the game,</i>

18:44.874 --> 18:46.208
and I have more to lose.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.171
<i>So, I better be prepared,
and I better win.</i>

18:50.671 --> 18:52.071
<i>And I think it's gonna be exciting.</i>

18:56.719 --> 18:58.697
Does anyone see the price tag
on this Lamborghini?

18:58.721 --> 19:00.514
- Jesus.
- Yeah, okay.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.809
535,000 dollars!

19:03.976 --> 19:06.187
Man, zero to 62 in 2.9 seconds.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.540
- Any information on the quarter-mile?
- I'm looking now.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.732
- No.
- 10.40s.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.068
- 10.40s?
- That's yo ass.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.486
10.40s.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.404
I thought they said a supercar.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.115
We're also on a drag radial tire.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.825
Woah.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.329
And all them on radials too,
I'm assuming, right?

19:22.495 --> 19:24.348
Yes. It's all the same,
same rules for everyone.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.373
Whatever, let's do it.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.643
But the other two sleepers,
that's what I'm more worried about.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.478
- Did they tell you what they were?
- No.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.104
There's one in Connecticut
and one in Jersey.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.088
Connecticut?

19:32.089 --> 19:34.191
Not worried about Jersey,
'cause we beat the fastest guy there.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.817
- Definitely.
- Not worried about Connecticut,

19:35.841 --> 19:37.361
because I haven't heard anything fast
about them.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.030
We might be the fastest car
in the tri-state area. We can hashtag it.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.615
Fastest car in the tri-state area.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.182
It's ugly, but it works.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.227
- It's what a sleeper's supposed to be.
- My man.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.204
<i>I'm willing to race anyone
at any time,</i>

19:47.228 --> 19:48.688
<i>and proving people wrong,</i>

19:48.771 --> 19:50.451
and beating people
that are faster than you

19:50.523 --> 19:53.234
or have better cars than you
is even better.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.152
<i>That's what I strive for.</i>

19:55.319 --> 19:57.359
I think we're just gonna pull out nitrous
right now.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.032
'Cause basically
if we don't take the nitrous out,

20:00.157 --> 20:01.957
I just think
we're gonna annihilate the tires.

20:02.243 --> 20:07.081
With not knowing the road I'll be racing,
I'm gonna be taking power out of the car,

20:07.164 --> 20:08.749
because I'd rather get down the road

20:08.958 --> 20:11.711
than blow the tires off
and lose by spinning.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.714
This thing's gonna leave... slow.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.724
Well, supercars don't leave
that hard either,

20:16.757 --> 20:18.134
but they go fast on the top end.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.136
That's why I don't want to take out
too much.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.024
- Right. That's right.
- And we'll gap him.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.098
We're racing
that Lamborghini Aventador SV.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.662
- Okay.
- I'm not overly scared to race it.

20:28.686 --> 20:32.440
I just said that's one
of the faster supercars that I know of.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.376
Just don't let him get in your head,
that's all.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.485
740 horse, all-wheel drive,

20:36.736 --> 20:38.946
estimated quarter mile runs 10.40s.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.191
That's gonna be a good race.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.450
<i>The truck's capable of running 10s.</i>

20:42.825 --> 20:45.411
Now, actually, that's gonna depend
on track conditions,

20:45.494 --> 20:48.456
weather... there's always a lot of factors
in drag racing.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.073
- Holy price tag.
- A little bit more than this?

20:51.125 --> 20:54.044
Couple of bucks, 447,000.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.089
With a top speed of 217 mile an hour.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.091
- Only 700 horse.
- Yes.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.736
For that kind of money,
only 700 horse.

21:00.801 --> 21:01.927
It's telling me, like, 750?

21:02.011 --> 21:04.239
He's gonna be a little upset
when he gets beat by a Chevy pickup.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.324
Yeah. I mean, we can only hope
he's not a drag racer.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.185
- Don't know how to make it leave.
- Drag racers don't buy them cars.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.103
No, they don't.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.106
<i>Most supercar owners aren't drag racers,</i>

21:14.607 --> 21:17.401
so they're not used to leaving
a red light hard.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.403
- They do have launch mode in it.
- Okay.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.614
If the guy has any clue
on how to drive the car,

21:21.697 --> 21:23.824
that's gonna be... can be an issue.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.668
Well, that comes to you
getting out of there.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.348
- Yeah.
- Don't be late.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.040
<i>So, before the race, we go through a tune.</i>

21:31.165 --> 21:34.502
<i>We make sure the boost levels look good,
air/fuel ratio, stuff like that.</i>

21:34.585 --> 21:36.897
The only other thing we want to do
is put more boost in it.

21:36.921 --> 21:39.089
I can go to 20, see what it does.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.095
That'll be all right for one pass.

21:41.217 --> 21:45.888
Turbochargers use exhaust to spin
a turbine to force air into the motor.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.098
<i>The harder you spin the turbo,</i>

21:48.182 --> 21:49.743
<i>the more air you're forcing
into the motor,</i>

21:49.767 --> 21:52.353
<i>the more boost it creates.
And that creates more power.</i>

21:53.312 --> 21:55.648
<i>On the street,
I'm running 13 pounds of boost.</i>

21:55.773 --> 21:58.651
For this race, I can put it to 20,
and it would take it.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.096
For how long, I don't know,
but it would take it for a bit.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.197
<i>Twenty is kind of a time bomb.</i>

22:03.280 --> 22:05.217
I think you've got nothing
to worry about that Lambo.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.551
- Yeah.
- If we get out on him,

22:06.575 --> 22:09.295
- it's over with for him.
- Oh, yeah. He won't catch me once I'm out.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.665
<i>The Lamborghini Aventador SV...</i>

22:13.249 --> 22:14.667
<i>is an awesome car.</i>

22:15.042 --> 22:18.629
<i>It is my favorite supercar out of probably
any supercar out there right now.</i>

22:19.004 --> 22:21.316
<i>And being able to prove
that I can run with that kind of car</i>

22:21.340 --> 22:22.660
is a pretty cool feeling to have.

22:31.684 --> 22:35.896
<i>First time I saw Davina ten years ago,</i>

22:36.146 --> 22:38.107
<i>I looked at her and I said, "That's it.</i>

22:38.232 --> 22:39.275
<i>My life's over."</i>

22:39.400 --> 22:44.488
Now I'm not gonna get any more women,
'cause I just met the only woman for me.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.782
- The Lambo is amazing.
- You like it?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.093
- Love it.
- You know, during the day...

22:48.117 --> 22:49.386
What wheels did you put on?

22:49.410 --> 22:50.971
- Nishi road wheels.
- Nishi?

22:50.995 --> 22:53.598
- Enjoy yourself. Nice seeing you guys.
- Thanks a lot. Good to see you.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.625
We're not actually married,
but we are soulmates.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.210
Mai Tai right here.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.838
<i>When I met Davina, I had a Lotus,</i>

23:01.046 --> 23:02.798
<i>and I loved that Lotus.</i>

23:03.507 --> 23:05.175
<i>She's a self-professed gold digger.</i>

23:05.259 --> 23:08.345
When she saw that Lotus,
that wasn't really going to work.

23:08.804 --> 23:09.889
That's good stuff, man.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.849
It's so dope.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.768
<i>She figured
it wasn't even 100,000 dollars.</i>

23:15.227 --> 23:17.521
<i>And then she said,
"You know, look, if you're so rich,</i>

23:17.813 --> 23:19.481
<i>how come I'm not in a Lamborghini?"</i>

23:19.607 --> 23:21.859
And I said, "Oh, yeah?"
And went right to the store.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.987
This is the love of my life.
This is concubine.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.906
- She made this tonight.
- Yes!

23:27.156 --> 23:31.577
This right here, from the slipcovers
of my grandmother's couch.

23:31.785 --> 23:35.789
The plastic slipcovers.
Do you see that? Yeah!

23:39.001 --> 23:40.801
<i>Bryan loves to call me
the concubine.</i>

23:40.920 --> 23:43.047
<i>This all started when he went to China.</i>

23:43.839 --> 23:46.967
From what I hear,
the most powerful woman there

23:47.217 --> 23:50.387
was not the empress,
but it was the concubine,

23:50.846 --> 23:52.056
dragon lady.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.893
And I have a dragon on my back.
So, I was like, dragon lady, concubine?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.729
She's in charge?
I want to be the concubine.

23:58.854 --> 24:03.525
You guys know that Bryan's birthday
is coming up in the next two weeks.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.195
So, every year we do a photo shoot.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.658
<i>Lamborghini gave me, us, a status...</i>

24:10.991 --> 24:12.159
everywhere we go.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.454
Do you remember, they said,
"Oh, if you buy this car,

24:15.579 --> 24:18.874
you'll be invited to parties
that you were never invited to."

24:19.458 --> 24:20.778
<i>And I'm thinking, "Oh, bullshit."</i>

24:21.251 --> 24:24.296
<i>Within six months,
we had met most every celebrity,</i>

24:24.380 --> 24:26.382
- had been to the Playboy mansion...
- Yeah.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.009
...had been to parties
we would have never been invited to.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.844
- Right.
- And it just got better.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.097
Salute!

24:34.765 --> 24:36.308
<i>We're never apart.</i>

24:37.142 --> 24:40.062
It's like no other relationship I've seen,
and I've done

24:40.145 --> 24:41.981
<i>20,000 divorce cases</i>

24:42.106 --> 24:44.226
<i>and I've never seen anything
like my own relationship.</i>

24:44.608 --> 24:46.248
- Babe, you got the key?
- Yeah, I got it.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.905
<i>I met a man that's not only rich,</i>

24:50.656 --> 24:52.700
but he's also a wonderful person.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.911
<i>And he gives back like nobody else does.</i>

24:56.578 --> 25:00.249
<i>Davina is the most experienced
Lamborghini co-driver</i>

25:00.666 --> 25:01.875
<i>on the face of the earth.</i>

25:02.626 --> 25:04.920
<i>She is the navigator, the social media,</i>

25:05.170 --> 25:07.423
<i>she's the DJ. Everything.</i>

25:08.007 --> 25:10.259
<i>So, for this race, she has her own plans.</i>

25:10.676 --> 25:14.013
I'm gonna go there,
and I'm gonna talk shit.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.765
<i>I'm gonna distract the other driver,</i>

25:16.932 --> 25:18.267
and he's gonna win.

25:21.729 --> 25:24.690
<i>The next thing we've got to do
is change the tires.</i>

25:26.066 --> 25:28.277
<i>A regular tire has steel belts in it.</i>

25:29.361 --> 25:31.905
<i>These tires are bias-ply.
They're softer.</i>

25:31.989 --> 25:33.709
<i>When you heat them up,
they get even softer,</i>

25:33.782 --> 25:36.535
and then grips the road
twice as hard as it did

25:36.660 --> 25:38.662
prior to, like, a regular street tire.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.622
Nice and flat, the way they need to be,

25:40.914 --> 25:42.750
so we can heat them up

25:42.875 --> 25:44.043
and get that traction going.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.335
We don't want to lose.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.423
<i>It's pretty unsafe to lower the pressure
in a regular street tire</i>

25:49.757 --> 25:51.383
versus a bias-ply tire like this.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.833
- Just ready to do some burnouts.
- Yeah, let's do this.

25:54.303 --> 25:57.556
<i>There's definitely a fear
of racing Turbo Tony, so to speak.</i>

25:58.515 --> 26:00.326
<i>When I first started,
everybody wanted to race,</i>

26:00.350 --> 26:01.602
<i>'cause I was just the new kid.</i>

26:05.022 --> 26:08.192
As time progressed,
nobody really wanted to race anymore.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.118
Just because of the fact
that I kept winning.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.739
<i>They just feel that they don't have
a chance to begin with,</i>

26:13.822 --> 26:16.325
<i>'cause I build
some pretty bad-ass street cars.</i>

26:31.882 --> 26:33.592
I'll just take the nitrous bottle out now.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.490
So, you're coming out
with almost no nitrous.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.754
Yeah, it's basically our motor.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.892
Another thing we have to do
is change the timing,

26:41.975 --> 26:44.478
'cause we lowered the nitrous shot.
So, took nitrous out.

26:44.728 --> 26:48.440
You know, we took power out
because... of the radial tires.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.901
It's the only way
we're gonna be able to go A to B.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.028
<i>I'm gonna be taking power out of the car.</i>

26:53.153 --> 26:55.531
<i>Performance-wise, I'm not worried at all.</i>

26:56.281 --> 26:59.451
<i>It's more of getting down the road
than blowing the tires off.</i>

27:00.285 --> 27:01.829
<i>I think I have a big shot at winning.</i>

27:07.417 --> 27:09.253
<i>This is a road that I like to test on</i>

27:09.419 --> 27:11.421
<i>any time I make any kind of changes
on the truck.</i>

27:13.382 --> 27:16.542
<i>I like to try to simulate what will happen
if I'm driving normally down the road</i>

27:16.718 --> 27:19.388
<i>where it's not a prepped road,
there's not a lot of rubber down.</i>

27:19.555 --> 27:21.699
<i>So, I'll do a quick burnout
just to get a little bit of heat</i>

27:21.723 --> 27:23.243
<i>in the tires,
and I'll try to make sure</i>

27:23.350 --> 27:26.145
<i>the boost levels look good,
air/fuel ratio, stuff like that.</i>

27:26.436 --> 27:28.730
Make sure everything is cohesive
with the truck.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.483
<i>I usually try to find that happy medium</i>

27:31.567 --> 27:33.861
<i>to where it'll take
maximum amount of power</i>

27:33.944 --> 27:35.946
<i>but not spin the tires
going down the road.</i>

27:38.073 --> 27:39.533
<i>Burnout went well.</i>

27:39.616 --> 27:42.077
<i>The truck feels like
it's accelerating pretty hard right now.</i>

27:42.327 --> 27:43.579
<i>Tracks look pretty even.</i>

27:44.204 --> 27:46.290
<i>The truck's got to be 100 percent.</i>

27:46.790 --> 27:48.990
You can never be too prepared
going in to race anything.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.337
<i>I saw a little bit of smoke
right after I did the burnout,</i>

27:52.504 --> 27:55.007
<i>and the one turbo feed line
which actually oils</i>

27:55.090 --> 27:57.718
<i>the inside of the turbo
got a small leak in it.</i>

27:57.801 --> 27:59.779
<i>So, it's just kind of spitting
a little bit of oil out</i>

27:59.803 --> 28:01.096
<i>right on top of the turbo.</i>

28:02.097 --> 28:03.724
<i>It's an easy fix. It's just a fitting.</i>

28:03.849 --> 28:05.569
<i>It's not the end of the world
for the truck.</i>

28:09.563 --> 28:11.683
<i>The most important part of anything
with racing</i>

28:11.732 --> 28:14.401
<i>is making sure your car's running
100 percent before you get there.</i>

28:15.319 --> 28:16.919
You can make all the power in the world.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.239
If you can't use it, it's useless.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.367
<i>We're making a burnout box right now.</i>

28:26.914 --> 28:29.333
<i>The tires are nice and flat,
the way they need to be,</i>

28:29.499 --> 28:31.919
<i>so we can heat them up
and get that traction going.</i>

28:33.086 --> 28:35.797
<i>When the tire's full of air,
it's just gonna end up spinning off,</i>

28:36.215 --> 28:37.257
<i>and it doesn't grip.</i>

28:37.341 --> 28:39.801
<i>We're gonna be around six
to eight pounds of air pressure,</i>

28:40.177 --> 28:43.680
<i>just so that way the tire is flat
and it's just gripping</i>

28:43.764 --> 28:45.764
<i>with everything it has
and gives you more traction.</i>

28:50.896 --> 28:51.980
<i>It's not running right.</i>

28:53.732 --> 28:56.902
<i>The reason why we couldn't do a burnout
is because we have to work out the bugs</i>

28:57.027 --> 28:58.028
<i>in the fuel system.</i>

29:00.239 --> 29:02.157
It's crazy lean, dude.

29:02.491 --> 29:03.909
Like it dropped pressure instantly.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.346
<i>When we took the old injectors out,
found a little rust in them,</i>

29:06.370 --> 29:09.248
<i>which obviously,
that leads to a rusted fuel tank,</i>

29:09.331 --> 29:11.041
<i>and nobody wants that in their race car.</i>

29:11.208 --> 29:13.728
It didn't hurt the engine or nothing,
'cause we were just... we're testing.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.004
This is why you test,
to get ready for the big day.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.417
<i>This race means something to me.</i>

29:36.441 --> 29:37.943
And I want to look good.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.905
Very difficult to rock clothes like this,
but I can pull that off.

29:42.489 --> 29:46.743
<i>Growing up,
I had maybe two pairs of jeans.</i>

29:46.994 --> 29:49.997
Often, I was made fun of,
because my clothes were dirty.

29:50.622 --> 29:54.042
<i>But I noticed that I could have
nice things if I worked hard.</i>

29:54.501 --> 29:55.752
<i>So, after law school,</i>

29:55.877 --> 29:57.921
<i>I worked seven days a week,</i>

29:58.463 --> 29:59.983
and then the money started to come in.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.302
I wanted to take it to that next level,
and I didn't know where to go.

30:03.427 --> 30:07.514
So, actually, Davina
used to go to this woman who does...

30:08.557 --> 30:10.142
she does clothes for strippers.

30:12.102 --> 30:15.314
If anyone has what it takes to win,
that would be me.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.108
These are not sleeper clothes.
Let me tell you something.

30:18.442 --> 30:21.069
And that's about as chrome as it gets,
now, isn't it?

30:21.695 --> 30:23.006
Yo, you got plugs in it too?

30:23.030 --> 30:24.924
- Yeah, are you able to check that?
- Yeah.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.988
<i>I've changed every nut and bolt
on this car.</i>

30:27.451 --> 30:29.953
<i>It's just an ongoing process,
and I'm gonna keep building,</i>

30:30.037 --> 30:31.371
<i>just go faster and faster.</i>

30:33.040 --> 30:35.834
<i>The adrenaline rush of street racing
is insane.</i>

30:37.002 --> 30:40.922
It's confidence. It's how confident that
you're gonna win that race at that time.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.843
<i>The car's ready.
I think I got it, no problem.</i>

30:47.346 --> 30:50.265
<i>If I took this car on race day
and tried to race,</i>

30:50.724 --> 30:52.059
<i>I would've embarrassed myself,</i>

30:52.142 --> 30:54.394
<i>'cause it would've gone
absolutely nowhere.</i>

30:54.936 --> 30:58.774
<i>The car just didn't have any power.
It was basically starved for fuel.</i>

30:58.857 --> 31:00.418
<i>Not a big deal, we're already back in it.</i>

31:00.442 --> 31:01.777
Hey, you're looking good.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.779
Actually, got to add another part to it,
real quick.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.333
Well, she's gonna run much better now.
I know she gonna run much better.

31:12.621 --> 31:16.124
Mitsubishis inherently
have electrical issues,

31:16.416 --> 31:20.170
and adding extra grounds in these cars
is actually proven to pick up horsepower.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.048
<i>It's the most important part of anything
with racing,</i>

31:23.131 --> 31:25.568
is making sure your car's running
100 percent before you get there.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.469
- Now we're ready.
- We're ready.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.010
<i>I've learned a couple tricks
talking to guys</i>

31:31.181 --> 31:33.517
<i>that I know are big turbo guys that race.</i>

31:34.851 --> 31:36.691
<i>Definitely a huge learning experience
with this</i>

31:36.728 --> 31:39.481
<i>on how the turbos are piped,
turbo sizing.</i>

31:39.564 --> 31:42.734
There's a lot of factors
in how it makes boost.

31:42.943 --> 31:45.153
- Did that stop leaking?
- Yeah.

31:45.779 --> 31:48.907
- It's stopped? Did you change this?
- No, I tightened it. I tightened it up.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.786
I think the truck's gonna be a lot faster
than a lot of people think it is.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.165
<i>I'm a rally driver.
I've never done a drag race.</i>

31:58.291 --> 32:00.377
<i>I'm just gonna put this car
on launch control.</i>

32:00.460 --> 32:01.711
<i>That's what it's for.</i>

32:02.379 --> 32:06.466
<i>Lamborghini spent millions
developing this exact feature.</i>

32:06.716 --> 32:08.051
<i>The car's gonna do all the work,</i>

32:08.260 --> 32:12.139
so I am extremely prepared to win
and to be very fast.

32:12.806 --> 32:17.060
Gabriel, you know I commissioned this
just for a race against sleeper cars.

32:17.477 --> 32:18.937
I wanted to look good...

32:19.646 --> 32:21.773
and I'm not sleeper.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.651
Everything about me is flashy,
but this jacket is elegant.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.903
- Elegant like crazy.
- So, we have the white piping.

32:27.154 --> 32:30.407
- You've got the Lambo patches. The lapels.
- This piping is fantastic.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.493
Looks just like the seats, man.
Fantastic.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.288
You got the magnetic buttons,
you've got the inserts.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.166
- Got my high collar.
- High collar,

32:39.416 --> 32:41.185
- double...
- What's on the back? I can't see.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.294
That's Lamborghini.

32:44.171 --> 32:46.715
I've raced helicopters,
I've raced jet planes.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.532
I don't know what's out there for me,
but I want to be ready.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.279
Well, they're not gonna look
as sharp as you,

32:51.303 --> 32:53.783
- so that's something.
- That's it. So, I'm winning either way.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.138
<i>Driving and feeling my truck
right now,</i>

33:17.162 --> 33:19.372
<i>I am not worried about racing a supercar.</i>

33:20.499 --> 33:22.542
<i>But this is drag racing.
Anything can happen.</i>

33:25.462 --> 33:27.631
- All right, Chuck. Very nice.
- Thank you.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.154
- Thanks for coming out.
- Thank you.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.970
<i>I'm very confident
in racing my Colt.</i>

33:34.095 --> 33:35.555
<i>I know the car inside and out.</i>

33:39.518 --> 33:40.894
Is that pizza delivery?

33:41.061 --> 33:43.261
- That's Domino's.
- They still deliver?

33:48.026 --> 33:50.320
I could actually say,
he might be more sleeper than me.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.256
<i>In street racing,
it's never a guarantee you're gonna win.</i>

33:56.159 --> 33:59.120
<i>It's how confident that you're gonna win
that race at that time.</i>

34:01.706 --> 34:05.752
- That's an eight-second car. Low nines.
- It's got a big motor in it.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.148
Yeah, that's not what
I was hoping for today.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.172
No.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.972
This thing.
Our crew is heavier than this car.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.244
What's going on, man?
How you doing, it's Chuck.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.351
Nice to meet you.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.675
- I want to see this truck.
- Pop the hood.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.542
- Yeah.
- It's hilarious, it's a junkyard motor.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.646
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's always a junkyard.

34:29.775 --> 34:31.194
It is a junkyard motor.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.880
- What?
- That's fucking cool.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.114
This guy's the man.

34:34.531 --> 34:37.371
<i>All three of us will mile-an-hour
real well in the quarter-mile,</i>

34:37.659 --> 34:40.699
<i>so I don't really see the Lambo having
a whole bunch of a shot with us three.</i>

34:41.079 --> 34:43.918
It's really gonna come down to who can
get the car to leave the hardest.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.355
Let's guess what color it is.

34:49.379 --> 34:50.690
- Green.
- It's gonna be white.

34:50.714 --> 34:51.940
- Yellow.
- Black.

34:51.965 --> 34:54.301
- Look who we got here.
- Looks chrome.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.220
Damn.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.056
And not a bad way to spend 500,000.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.660
He's driving down right now
being like, "Look at this,

35:02.684 --> 35:04.185
what is that, a junkyard down there?"

35:05.145 --> 35:06.396
Oh, look at that.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.483
- Oh my god.
- Oh, look at that.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.859
<i>I bought an Italian supercar,</i>

35:11.192 --> 35:12.485
<i>and didn't build it,</i>

35:12.694 --> 35:13.903
<i>'cause I don't build shit.</i>

35:14.237 --> 35:16.364
<i>I just polished it last night.
That's all I do.</i>

35:17.782 --> 35:19.142
Dude, that thing looks ridiculous.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.996
I've never wanted to game someone
more than them.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.206
Look, you can see her ass.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.519
Yeah, when I go home,
I'm wrapping my Colt in chrome.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.354
Unfortunately, the wrap's gonna cost
more than my whole car.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.218
That's why I say he's got more in the wrap
than I do in the whole truck.

35:34.341 --> 35:35.341
All right.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.361
Dude, that thing's gonna blind you
in the sun.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.929
I know. Is that illegal? I'm like.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.807
All right, D. Look at that thing.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.685
- He is gonna be pissed later.
- Yes.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.190
You know, I wanted the name Team Shitbox.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.507
They must have contacted you first.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.837
The ones I saw online, I was like,
"Wow, that's a really nice car."

35:54.861 --> 35:57.501
You see that thing, and you're like,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

35:57.656 --> 36:00.033
So, I'm gonna put my roof on like you do.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.035
'Cause if you pass me, you beat me,

36:02.118 --> 36:04.663
I don't want pieces of your car
flying at me.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.809
After today, are you gonna change
the plate to "Losing?"

36:08.833 --> 36:10.418
Oooh.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.171
Actually? No.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.775
You might want to check out
the front of my car, though,

36:15.799 --> 36:17.239
'cause you might not see that again.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.261
Yeah, there we go.
That's how that goes.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.407
- Who's the driver of this?
- Right here.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.225
- Hey, I'm Bryan. What's your name?
- Tony.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.476
- What is it?
- Tony.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.228
Hey, Tony. Good to see you, man.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.021
So, this right here,

36:30.772 --> 36:32.148
too big to put a potato in.

36:32.232 --> 36:33.274
Oh, my God,

36:33.775 --> 36:34.901
there's a turbo in this.

36:34.984 --> 36:35.985
- It's a turbo.
- Yeah.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.237
It's little.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.824
This is the one that my experts
are telling me to be afraid of.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.386
I think you might need some new experts.

36:43.410 --> 36:44.536
<i>These cars are all fast.</i>

36:44.619 --> 36:47.706
If I can get ahead of these guys,
they're not gonna get ahead of me.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.207
<i>I need a little luck.</i>

36:49.791 --> 36:50.959
Just my driver skill here.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.814
- What's the duct tape for?
- Hold the fender together.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.131
- This is not a wrap?
- No.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.298
No?

36:58.007 --> 37:00.760
Please get to your car.
We're gonna go to the starting line.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.099
What the hell is that?

37:14.941 --> 37:17.777
<i>I hope nothing flies off
that thing and hits me.</i>

37:18.737 --> 37:20.506
<i>It's gonna be a whole bunch of tire smoke,</i>

37:20.530 --> 37:23.408
<i>and then you're gonna see
this little white Colt pulling way ahead.</i>

37:23.950 --> 37:25.720
<i>Driving and feeling my truck
right now,</i>

37:25.744 --> 37:27.412
<i>I am not worried about racing a supercar.</i>

37:36.045 --> 37:37.630
Fucking Lance, what the hell?

37:37.797 --> 37:40.633
You've got to shut that thing off.
I can't hear myself...

37:41.968 --> 37:44.763
All right, everybody here, please,
drivers and teams. Here, please.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.306
Thank you. All right.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.701
So, thanks everybody.
Again, thank you for coming out.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.685
We will go over the rules for the race.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.937
So, we will bring you all to the line.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.024
Everybody set on the line,
we say we're ready to race.

37:56.149 --> 37:58.651
I will hold out my arms like this, right?

37:59.360 --> 38:02.697
And I will turn my back,
and I will point to each light,

38:02.781 --> 38:05.283
to draw your attention from me
to the lights.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.243
That means we're about to go.
We are hot.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.829
I'm gonna sprint out of the way,
back through the box.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.749
It'll be flashing red, flashing red,
and then go green.

38:12.832 --> 38:13.958
That's when the race starts.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.878
- It's instant green light?
- It's instant green. You go on green.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.047
If a vehicle has a false start,

38:19.380 --> 38:21.382
that vehicle will be disqualified.

38:22.425 --> 38:26.763
The light will not turn green
until I am completely off the track.

38:27.138 --> 38:30.475
The winner of this race will go on
to the championship race

38:30.642 --> 38:32.602
in El Mirage dry lakebed.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.371
Let's have a good race,
ladies and gentlemen.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.955
Thank you for coming out.
Appreciate it.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.291
Want to check them tires real quick?

38:56.417 --> 38:58.257
I've got to a whole computer thing now.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.131
First hold down the... engage first gear.

39:03.633 --> 39:04.926
You got your gloves?

39:05.009 --> 39:07.569
I can't do the gloves,
'cause I have to do my launch control app.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.735
Okay, we're gonna bring you to the line.

39:17.438 --> 39:20.316
We're good?
All right. Now, that's it, man.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.986
Corsa, escape!

39:23.444 --> 39:29.075
<i>The Lamborghini launch control
has the car engaged at 4,500 RPM.</i>

39:29.367 --> 39:30.952
<i>And you feel the whole thing shaking.</i>

39:31.536 --> 39:35.164
<i>You live by or die by this system
that they have in this car.</i>

39:36.207 --> 39:39.127
<i>The truck has a lot of meaning
to me and my family.</i>

39:39.502 --> 39:42.922
<i>To win the race, I think, is gonna be
an awesome feeling for me and my dad,</i>

39:43.006 --> 39:46.134
<i>knowing that you don't need a ton of money
to build a race car.</i>

39:46.926 --> 39:49.971
<i>I like being the underdog.
My whole life, I've been the underdog.</i>

39:50.763 --> 39:52.243
<i>I'll do whatever I have to do to win.</i>

39:53.766 --> 39:55.953
<i>When you're standing there
with the chrome Lamborghini,</i>

39:55.977 --> 39:58.104
<i>everybody expects you to win.</i>

39:58.271 --> 40:00.857
<i>If you don't... that's humiliating.</i>

40:01.774 --> 40:04.277
<i>I want to be the baddest,</i>

40:04.444 --> 40:06.821
<i>you know, small tire racer
in the northeast.</i>

40:06.988 --> 40:09.490
<i>I want to be, like, the fastest of fast.</i>

40:09.657 --> 40:11.993
<i>You know?
So, this is, like, a dream for me.</i>

40:15.246 --> 40:16.289
Are you ready?

40:25.298 --> 40:28.426
- They both jumped, right?
- Those two are out, gone.

40:28.509 --> 40:31.888
Come on, bring it up, bring it up.
Bring it up. Come on, baby!

40:53.826 --> 40:55.596
- That was a good race.
- The Colt won.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.704
The Colt won.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.046
- You did it!
- I know.

41:05.129 --> 41:08.249
- How bad did you drive around him?
- I did, I thought he hit the brakes.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.301
- Yeah, buddy.
- Yeah.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.678
Way to wait. Way to wait.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.567
<i>This was
a good combination of cars.</i>

41:14.597 --> 41:15.974
<i>It really was, like, I'm just glad</i>

41:16.057 --> 41:18.035
<i>that I fucking kept it together
and the car stayed together.</i>

41:18.059 --> 41:20.245
<i>Like, I saw him go, and I'm like,
"Why'd they leave so early?"</i>

41:20.269 --> 41:21.509
<i>It didn't make any sense to me.</i>

41:22.021 --> 41:23.624
<i>And then I was like, "I'm just gonna
sit here</i>

41:23.648 --> 41:25.128
<i>and wait for my light to turn green."</i>

41:25.942 --> 41:29.654
<i>The truck just took off and I'm just like,
be calm, be calm, just keep driving.</i>

41:29.737 --> 41:32.217
<i>Bang, second, bang, fucking third,
and as soon as I hit fourth,</i>

41:32.281 --> 41:34.325
<i>it was just coming, coming,
coming, coming.</i>

41:34.659 --> 41:38.204
- I went by him pretty fast. I did.
- The underdog won.

41:40.415 --> 41:42.625
It's funny.
She wants to go to California.

41:44.627 --> 41:47.088
I'm just... God, I cannot believe
he came around me.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.507
Fuck, man!
He came by me like a frigging missile.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.987
<i>I'm mad that I had to watch
that front-wheel drive car</i>

41:53.011 --> 41:54.691
<i>come around me at 150 mile an hour, but...</i>

41:55.221 --> 41:56.901
for the most part,
yeah, it was a good day.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.942
<i>This was just absolutely great.</i>

42:00.184 --> 42:02.061
<i>To see this thing
go down that track, and...</i>

42:03.021 --> 42:04.230
<i>it's just amazing.</i>

42:04.355 --> 42:06.155
He did a heck of a job
in building this truck.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.901
That was stupid. Fuck.

42:09.694 --> 42:12.989
Dude, he left so early that I thought
I didn't see the light, so I just left.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.867
Yeah, I was...
I didn't have a good time there.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.870
<i>It sucked that we lost on a default.</i>

42:19.287 --> 42:20.747
<i>We hate losing on that.</i>

42:21.664 --> 42:23.666
<i>If I'd went on green,
I probably would've won.</i>

42:24.417 --> 42:27.297
<i>I think after this, I'm gonna go home.
I'm probably buying everyone food,</i>

42:27.378 --> 42:29.898
<i>because they've been all busting their ass
and helping me out so much</i>

42:29.922 --> 42:32.592
that I've got to hook them up
a little bit.

42:33.426 --> 42:34.969
<i>But it never ends.</i>

42:35.053 --> 42:37.406
<i>I've got to fix the car,
'cause I had a little issue at the end.</i>

42:37.430 --> 42:40.016
<i>So, I've got to do some updates,
and I'll be back on the streets.</i>

42:40.099 --> 42:42.828
Dude, you went, like, really,
really, really, really, really early.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.187
I fucked that up so bad.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.814
<i>I saw him go. I'm like, Lambo's out.</i>

42:47.023 --> 42:49.776
<i>- Wait, no, there goes Lance.
- I went be... I went off him.</i>

42:49.859 --> 42:51.402
Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.154
Did I almost mow you down? I'm sorry.

42:53.446 --> 42:55.446
I woke up this morning.
I said, "Don't get killed."

42:55.490 --> 42:57.259
- Good stuff, man.
- It's what I say every day.

42:57.283 --> 42:58.618
I'm gonna blame the equipment.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.513
<i>Oh, I'm not a drag racer.</i>

43:01.537 --> 43:05.083
<i>I'm more of a rally driver,
and I've never had to use the launch mode.</i>

43:05.166 --> 43:06.918
This was pretty new to me.

43:08.669 --> 43:11.589
It's a good day... it's always a good day
when you don't die, right?

43:11.839 --> 43:14.258
<i>I jumped the line,
which is not a good thing.</i>

43:14.634 --> 43:17.637
<i>See, so I finished too soon.</i>

43:17.970 --> 43:20.348
This usually doesn't happen to me.
I'd like to say that.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.728
- Hey, Tony.
- What up?

43:25.978 --> 43:27.647
- Good job, man. Come here.
- Thanks.

43:27.730 --> 43:30.084
You know, I've done it all.
I've swam with great white sharks,

43:30.108 --> 43:32.944
I've jumped out of planes,
I've been on Mount Kilimanjaro.

43:34.028 --> 43:36.364
<i>This, I'm just so grateful to be here.</i>

43:37.156 --> 43:38.699
<i>These people were good people.</i>

43:39.742 --> 43:42.662
And this is gonna be
the best experience I've had all year.

43:42.745 --> 43:43.955
- Lance?
- Yeah.

43:44.247 --> 43:45.891
- Sorry I jumped the line.
- It's all right.

43:45.915 --> 43:46.916
- Come here.
- No problem.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.417
- Any time.
- That's it, man.

43:49.252 --> 43:50.938
<i>The first reaction
of the Lambo driver,</i>

43:50.962 --> 43:52.213
<i>you know, him pulling up</i>

43:52.296 --> 43:55.842
<i>with, you know, the girlfriend
hanging out the window, you know,</i>

43:55.967 --> 43:58.386
<i>he's got all the gold and stuff on
like, this guy's gonna be</i>

43:58.469 --> 44:00.847
<i>the typical Lambo driver,
cocky and this and that.</i>

44:00.972 --> 44:02.765
<i>But, you know, as soon as I met him,</i>

44:02.890 --> 44:04.225
he changed my mind right away.

44:04.725 --> 44:06.325
All right, so how was that for you guys?

44:06.352 --> 44:08.271
Apparently, we have a winner.

44:08.563 --> 44:09.689
We do have a winner.

44:09.772 --> 44:11.959
- All right. All right, yeah.
- So, Tony, congratulations.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.609
Congratulations, very nice.

44:13.693 --> 44:15.587
<i>I'm happy how the car is running.
It's running absolutely perfect,</i>

44:15.611 --> 44:18.197
<i>and I'm happy that I won.</i>

44:18.781 --> 44:20.575
<i>I'm pretty happy. This is a good day.</i>

44:25.121 --> 44:26.414
I'm so proud of you.
