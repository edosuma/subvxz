WEBVTT

00:22.313 --> 00:24.190
Okay, so be honest.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.027
Why did you really stay in Paris?

00:29.279 --> 00:30.989
I can't really remember.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.493
I guess, work.

00:35.577 --> 00:41.791
It wasn't, like, something or someone
that influenced your decision?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.418
I see what you're getting at.

00:45.128 --> 00:49.340
And, yeah… it was… someone.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.675
I thought so.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.553
Antoine. Yep.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.346
I stayed for him.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.849
I mean, who wouldn't?
The guy's so suave.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.602
[chuckles]

01:01.770 --> 01:04.397
Speaking of, I better get going.

01:04.481 --> 01:07.942
No. No, can we just stay in bed
a few more minutes?

01:08.693 --> 01:10.945
Aw, Cooper.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.783
I never thought I'd see the day
when you didn't want to go to work.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.534
I know, me neither.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.162
But everything's
just such a mess right now.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.041
Except for this.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.168
Being here with you.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.545
It's all I want to do.

01:29.506 --> 01:33.301
So, whatever the reason is
that you ended up staying in Paris,

01:33.384 --> 01:35.136
I'm really glad that you did.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.014
Me too.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.827
Ugh! The elevator's down again?

01:58.910 --> 02:01.329
This time it's up,
but it won't come back down.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.000
[in French] This is the third time
in a week, monsieur.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.335
[grumbles]

02:08.419 --> 02:10.046
[in English] I'm speaking French, right?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.339
I think so.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.842
[in French] The elevator
is delicate, madame.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.510
It is part of the charm of the building.

02:15.593 --> 02:19.305
And thanks to you, it's been carrying
a heavy load for far too long.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.808
No. It's broken.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.603
[in English] No. Broken.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.813
No shit!

02:29.065 --> 02:30.441
Can you sort this for me?

02:30.525 --> 02:31.734
I cannot deal with this.

02:31.818 --> 02:35.488
I've got Gilbert Group Corporate up my ass
because we are hemorrhaging clients,

02:35.572 --> 02:37.907
and they've scheduled
a check-in Zoom tomorrow.

02:37.991 --> 02:43.246
This is the the only thing I have left
that is not encrusted with baby vomit.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.254
So, um, we fix?

02:52.839 --> 02:53.673
Now.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.973
[in French] This building
is only for residents.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.600
You can't have an office here.

03:03.683 --> 03:08.021
It's not an office, my apartment
is a temporary meeting place.

03:08.104 --> 03:12.066
Temporary? People have been coming
and going for weeks! Like him!

03:12.150 --> 03:15.653
Good morning, Colette!
You look lovely today.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.238
Stop leaving that thing in the hallway!

03:17.322 --> 03:18.573
I almost tripped over it!

03:18.656 --> 03:19.824
Put it outside, Luc.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.869
Oh, no, no, someone will steal it.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.954
Then don't ride it to work.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.791
See! It is an office, I'm reporting you!

03:28.875 --> 03:30.168
Have a good day, Colette.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.544
[Colette] I'm reporting you.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.962
Have a good day!

03:37.926 --> 03:39.719
Don't be mad,
but I moved some furniture around

03:39.802 --> 03:41.012
just to open up the space.

03:41.095 --> 03:41.930
It's better, right?

03:44.098 --> 03:45.099
Move it all back.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.059
I agree.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.602
Emily.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.312
[Emily in English] <i>Hi, Luc.</i>

03:49.395 --> 03:51.731
-Sorry to ask but I need a favor.
-Uh-huh.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.608
<i>We're having issues with our elevator</i>

03:53.691 --> 03:56.361
and, since you know Henri so well…

03:56.444 --> 03:57.403
Yes, of course.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.530
-Of course. I speak with him.
-Merci.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.991
Yes, you're welcome.
Bye, bye.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.244
[in French] What are you and Emily
conspiring about this time?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.246
What? It's not scheming.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.498
I'm just helping her
with the elevator at Savoir.

04:08.581 --> 04:12.210
I have a very warm relationship
with Henri, the building manager.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.468
If you have such a warm relationship,

04:20.551 --> 04:23.429
maybe we should take him out to dinner?

04:24.472 --> 04:27.392
Henri? Yes, of course.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.394
[sighs]

04:38.069 --> 04:38.903
<i>Merci.</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:42.573
-You really look like the dog.
-What?

04:42.657 --> 04:45.368
[in English] Are you taking unsolicited
photos for Instagram?

04:45.451 --> 04:46.536
We talked about this.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.496
No. It's for a pet food client pitch.

04:48.579 --> 04:49.414
Pet food?

04:50.206 --> 04:52.458
Wow. You guys are getting desperate.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.710
Yeah, tell me about it.

04:54.210 --> 04:57.547
So I woke up alone this morning again.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.716
Have you moved in to Alfie's hotel?

05:00.258 --> 05:03.928
No. But I'm starting
to get that look from the hotel staff.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.848
Every <i>"bonjour"</i> they say is so loaded.

05:07.515 --> 05:11.019
Can you drag yourselves out of bed
to make it to the jazz club tonight?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.438
Of course! Wouldn't miss your big show.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.940
This gig is gonna be
such great exposure for you.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.861
I know. The club is so iconic.
I just wish I wasn't doing it alone.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.237
I'll be there.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.322
I know.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.573
I mean Benoît.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.784
You know, I'm used to following his cues,

05:26.868 --> 05:28.244
and whenever I get nervous,

05:28.328 --> 05:31.205
I look at him with his shirt
unbuttoned down to his navel,

05:31.289 --> 05:33.374
-and I just feel at ease.
-Oh. [chuckles]

05:33.458 --> 05:35.793
Oh, that shih tzu has bangs like you.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.795
Are those trauma bangs too?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.256
No? Fine.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.057
-[Alfie] Blimey, this place is posh.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.308
Go, Mindy.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.186
I mean, she's really stepping up
into the big leagues.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.687
I'm so proud of her.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.607
Hey, can I ask you a work question?

05:58.149 --> 05:59.859
I'm impressed you didn't dive right in.

05:59.942 --> 06:01.194
-I'm learning.
-[chuckles]

06:01.527 --> 06:05.531
Do you think Antoine will return to Savoir
now that Sylvie's under a non-compete?

06:05.615 --> 06:09.452
Cooper, I'm his CFO,
not his Creative Director.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.372
But you're still a part
of those conversations, right?

06:12.455 --> 06:15.375
It's like PR and Marketing,
we're always smooshed together.

06:15.708 --> 06:20.463
The thing is Savoir has a long history
with Maison Lavaux, and it…

06:24.759 --> 06:26.052
What was that for?

06:26.886 --> 06:27.720
I felt like it.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.681
What was you saying?

06:30.932 --> 06:31.891
Hmm?

06:31.974 --> 06:33.184
I don't know. No idea.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.102
[chuckles]

06:34.185 --> 06:35.436
[in French] You two lovebirds?

06:35.520 --> 06:36.646
[whispers] Over here.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.982
Look at you two.

06:40.066 --> 06:40.942
[chuckles]

06:42.026 --> 06:44.195
Where's Gabriel?

06:44.278 --> 06:45.738
Oh, he's stuck at work.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.491
He wanted to come,
but the restaurant's fully booked.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.576
Again? He's killing it.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.912
I know. He's doing so well, but, um…

06:53.538 --> 06:56.749
It's funny, since I moved in,
we see less of each other.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.753
Like, when we lived apart,
we'd make more of an effort I guess.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.631
Do date nights. Kiss in jazz clubs.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.384
Don't take this time
for granted, you guys.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.301
We won't.

07:07.927 --> 07:08.761
[chuckles]

07:12.056 --> 07:13.683
[people chattering indistinctly]

07:13.766 --> 07:14.600
[Sylvie] Henri.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.855
[in French] I'm so happy
we're finally doing this.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.774
It's wonderful to get to know you better.

07:21.858 --> 07:22.984
Really?

07:23.985 --> 07:25.069
<i>Merci.</i>

07:25.153 --> 07:28.781
I was told to never speak to you directly.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.325
What? No. No.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.077
What a terrible misunderstanding.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.412
No, you said, don't let that dirty--

07:34.495 --> 07:36.205
I love that shirt.

07:37.665 --> 07:38.916
It really complements your eyes.

07:39.000 --> 07:39.834
Really?

07:39.917 --> 07:42.462
I've never noticed how beautiful they are.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.172
Thanks.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.591
For the 15 years I've worked with you,

07:46.674 --> 07:49.427
I didn't think you'd noticed me at all.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.805
I was very intimidated by you.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.560
You shouldn't have.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.606
I can't believe you left Savoir.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.774
It's those Americans.

08:04.442 --> 08:09.989
They forced us out of our office.
In our country. Can you believe it?

08:12.074 --> 08:15.119
Can they do that? Is that legal?

08:15.203 --> 08:17.163
Well, Sylvie was
starting her own company so--

08:17.246 --> 08:19.707
I just miss working there so much.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.084
And seeing you.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.669
Hmm.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.797
If only there was a way
we could…

08:26.964 --> 08:28.007
[sighs]

08:28.090 --> 08:29.717
move out those intruders.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.719
I don't know.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.892
Anyone care for a Saint-Émilion?

08:37.975 --> 08:39.727
Ah, yeah, me, I'd like some.

08:39.810 --> 08:43.523
The cheaper bottles
are on this other page--

08:44.023 --> 08:46.317
We'll follow your lead. And please…

08:46.400 --> 08:47.485
Find the best one on the list.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.701
Give me 24 hours.

08:55.785 --> 08:59.080
I'll treat them
like any pests in the building.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.374
I'll smoke them out.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.044
[sighs seductively]

09:15.680 --> 09:16.681
[in English] Wow.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.890
You look gorgeous.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.226
Thanks, but don't look at me,
look at them.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.143
[Benoît] Why?

09:21.227 --> 09:24.605
Édith Piaf, Josephine Baker, Eartha Kitt.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.773
They all performed here?

09:25.856 --> 09:27.525
Yeah, and they used this dressing room.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.609
That's incredible.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.111
Incredibly intimidating.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.113
I feel like they're all staring at me,

09:32.196 --> 09:34.365
thinking, "What's this bitch doing here?"

09:34.448 --> 09:35.575
[laughs]

09:35.658 --> 09:37.076
You belong here, Mindy.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.287
They changed the set list,
then added these strings,

09:39.370 --> 09:41.497
so it's like
I'm singing with an orchestra.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.124
You'll be fine. Okay?

09:43.207 --> 09:46.085
And if you get nervous, just picture
everyone in the audience naked.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.503
That never works.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.213
So maybe just picture me naked.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.717
Okay, now, take a deep breath.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.803
[takes deep breath]

09:57.013 --> 09:57.847
Okay.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.266
[moans]

10:07.690 --> 10:08.524
Thank you.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.192
Any time.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.448
Is there anything else I can do?

10:57.740 --> 10:58.949
[crowd cheers]

11:53.129 --> 11:54.714
She sounds fantastic.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.048
She really does.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.175
-Your fly's open.
-What?

11:58.300 --> 11:59.885
Thank you.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.687
[panting] Phew!

12:13.441 --> 12:16.694
Is it hot in here
or am I just schwitzing from the stairs?

12:16.777 --> 12:18.529
No, it does feel warmer than usual.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.407
I've been calling Henri
to fix the elevator,

12:21.490 --> 12:22.658
but he's not answering.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.285
Well, keep trying.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.788
We can't expect potential clients
to climb those stairs.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.040
Luckily for us, they don't exist.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.500
[laughs] It's not a joke.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.211
I don't know how
I'm going to sugar-coat that news

12:34.295 --> 12:36.464
to the Gilbert Group
on my Zoom call this afternoon.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.133
Well, if it helps,
I'm close to signing a new brand.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.386
Edgard and Cooper,
it's a Belgian-based pet food company.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.181
I mean, it's not luxury, but you know…

12:45.931 --> 12:49.560
I don't care. At this point,
they could sell dog food or dog shit.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.145
Show me the pitch.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.275
[Emily] People often look like their pets.

12:56.358 --> 12:59.069
But for this campaign,
we're going to take it one step further

12:59.153 --> 13:00.821
and let people become their pets.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.699
With the help
of Edgard and Cooper's avatar filter.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.493
First you start with the photo.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.995
Here is a cute cat wearing a sunhat.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.497
-[chuckles]
-No idea why.

13:10.331 --> 13:14.627
Then using the camera
on your phone or computer…

13:15.461 --> 13:16.921
Look how red I am.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.924
I look like a tomato with tits.

13:20.007 --> 13:23.219
-It's hot in here, right?
-Yeah. And the French don't do AC.

13:24.011 --> 13:27.264
Okay open a window, will you.
I think my breast milk is curdling.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.392
[rattling]

13:30.476 --> 13:33.187
Uh, this is sealed shut.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.481
Typical. Forget it.
Just where's the filter?

13:36.148 --> 13:37.900
Uh…

13:39.151 --> 13:40.486
<i>Meow.</i>

13:40.569 --> 13:42.404
[both laugh]

13:42.738 --> 13:45.074
Oh, my… This is so cool. Em.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.202
QR codes on packaging billboards
and print ads will link to their app

13:48.285 --> 13:51.997
so consumers can upload images
of their beloved fur baby,

13:52.081 --> 13:54.083
and share their pet avatar to socials.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.461
[Madeline chuckles]
I love to party.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.588
I love it!

13:59.672 --> 14:01.507
Just don't say fur baby.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.093
It's offensive to people
who have actual babies.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.722
I knew it. The heat is on.
In the middle of summer!

14:09.265 --> 14:12.351
I can't do my Zoom in here.
It's like working in a hot pocket!

14:16.981 --> 14:17.982
[in French] Hello.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.692
All the residents have signed a petition.

14:19.775 --> 14:20.609
Sylvie.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.029
What's this?

14:24.113 --> 14:26.991
If you don't move your business elsewhere,
you'll be evicted--

14:27.867 --> 14:29.285
That won't be necessary.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.286
But--

14:30.369 --> 14:31.579
Shh, shh, shh.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.958
How's everything going over there,
<i>mon chéri?</i>

14:36.542 --> 14:38.544
Our plan is in motion.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.379
-[knocking on door]
-Henri? Are you there?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.381
You're a genius.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.592
Americans have
such a ridiculous aversion to heat.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.677
It's barely on.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.596
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up.

14:49.847 --> 14:55.311
It's very hot in our office!

14:58.147 --> 15:01.150
Were you waiting? I'd give it a minute.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.193
And you're out of toilet paper.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.236
Luc.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.154
What?

15:05.237 --> 15:06.447
Henri, yes.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.157
The sooner we're back there,

15:08.240 --> 15:11.452
the sooner the two of us can celebrate
over another bottle of Saint-Émilion.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.494
Say hi from me.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.580
It won't be long, madame…

15:15.205 --> 15:16.457
[knocking]

15:16.540 --> 15:17.833
Henri, are you there?

15:18.626 --> 15:19.627
[in English] Please…

15:21.253 --> 15:22.922
[in French] Trust me.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.591
[groans]

15:29.303 --> 15:31.680
From heat or sleep deprivation,
I'm so light-headed

15:31.764 --> 15:32.890
I could eat three of these.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.183
Your Zoom's about to start.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.268
Don't rush me. I'll get hiccups.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.604
[creature cooing]

15:38.687 --> 15:39.521
What was that?

15:39.605 --> 15:40.689
It sounded like a--

15:40.773 --> 15:42.107
[both gasp]

15:42.399 --> 15:43.943
[Emily screams]

15:45.277 --> 15:46.862
Oh, my God, my croissant.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.782
My croissant.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.325
-Get out.
-Out! Out.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.494
[in French] Out!

15:53.577 --> 15:56.246
-[in English] You think it knows French?
-It's worth trying.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.289
[in French] Go out.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.667
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo!

15:59.750 --> 16:00.668
[screams]

16:00.751 --> 16:01.794
Out. Out.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.087
[in English] Get it out.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.381
-How?
-You grew up with animals, didn't you?

16:05.464 --> 16:07.049
Dogs, not birds.

16:07.132 --> 16:07.967
Oh, my--

16:08.092 --> 16:11.053
[both screaming]

16:17.518 --> 16:18.477
Go.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.979
-Yes. Go.
-Get.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.605
<i>Au revoir.</i>

16:21.689 --> 16:23.357
<i>-Oui.</i>
<i>-Très bien.</i>

16:23.440 --> 16:25.025
-Go. <i>Merci.</i>
<i>-Très bien.</i>

16:25.109 --> 16:27.611
Now go find Henri--
Henry. What? Henri?

16:27.695 --> 16:28.946
Yes, Henri. I'm on it.

16:29.029 --> 16:29.863
Henri.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.450
<i>Bonjour, Chicago. Ça va?</i>

16:33.534 --> 16:36.245
[Patricia on phone]
<i>Hi, Madeline. How are you?</i>

16:36.328 --> 16:38.414
[Judd] <i>I believe you have</i>
<i>a filter turned on.</i>

16:38.497 --> 16:39.957
[Madeline chuckles] Oh!

16:40.040 --> 16:41.917
Yes, Jed, I do. Sorry.

16:44.753 --> 16:50.634
I don't know how to remove the filter.
I'm trying…

16:50.718 --> 16:53.012
<i>I think you press the down arrow.</i>

16:53.095 --> 16:54.304
Down button.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.890
<i>It's in video settings.</i>

16:58.183 --> 16:59.143
Mmm…

16:59.435 --> 17:00.644
That's not it.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.479
<i>Should we call you back or…</i>

17:02.563 --> 17:06.942
No, actually this is
part of a new campaign

17:07.026 --> 17:08.485
that Emily's been working on.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.487
It's so life-like, isn't it?

17:10.571 --> 17:14.450
<i>Oh, is Emily there? Could she help?</i>

17:14.533 --> 17:15.534
[Madeline] Good idea.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.746
Hold just a moment
while I go on mute. Yeah?

17:19.496 --> 17:22.082
Emily get in here!
Turn this fucking filter off!

17:22.666 --> 17:24.626
[Patricia] <i>Madeline,</i>
<i>you're not muted.</i>

17:28.047 --> 17:29.131
[chuckles nervously]

17:29.965 --> 17:30.799
<i>Désolé.</i>

17:31.508 --> 17:32.509
Sorry.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.303
<i>You mentioned a new campaign.</i>

17:34.386 --> 17:36.388
<i>Can you step us through your pipeline?</i>

17:36.472 --> 17:38.182
<i>Including revenue for the next quarter.</i>

17:38.265 --> 17:41.226
Absolutely. We have
some very promising new leads.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.686
[screams]

17:43.604 --> 17:44.855
[gasps]

17:45.564 --> 17:46.565
Shoo!

17:47.566 --> 17:48.400
Shoo!

17:53.322 --> 17:55.991
<i>Is there a pigeon in your office?</i>

17:56.700 --> 17:57.534
<i>Oui.</i>

17:58.202 --> 18:02.372
[in English] Yes, our building manager
is on his way over to rectify some issues.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.209
Now, um, where were we?

18:05.292 --> 18:07.920
<i>How's the search</i>
<i>for the new French president going?</i>

18:08.003 --> 18:10.172
<i>Très bien. Très, très bien.</i>

18:10.672 --> 18:12.966
Now, I know it may not seem this way,

18:13.050 --> 18:16.178
but I promise you,
everything is under control.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.179
[chuckles]

18:21.892 --> 18:24.978
See? It's hot.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.356
<i>Très chaud.</i>

18:27.481 --> 18:29.483
[in English] Emily, where have you been?

18:29.566 --> 18:30.776
I went to find him.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.153
I couldn't get the cat filter off.
It was stuck on.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.613
I was completely humiliated

18:34.696 --> 18:36.865
in front of
the entire Gilbert Group board.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.242
Madeline, I'm so sorry.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.869
[in French] And you,

18:41.370 --> 18:44.039
we can't work like this.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.668
This office is a disaster!

18:47.751 --> 18:50.045
Sorry, madam,
but what do you want me to do about it?

18:50.129 --> 18:53.507
[in English] There's a fucking pigeon
in here.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.886
[in French] Pigeon!

18:57.970 --> 18:59.680
-[chuckles] Ah!
-[laughs sarcastically]

19:00.389 --> 19:02.683
[in English] But if you make mess…

19:04.643 --> 19:05.477
[gasps]

19:07.938 --> 19:10.691
How did it fly in here
when the windows are sealed shut?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.118
[in French] We're doing
lamb shoulder instead.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.494
Otherwise, good. Print it.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.412
-Okay.
-Thanks.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.248
[in English] Signing off
on tonight's menu.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.000
Do you ever take a night off?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.668
Have you ever run a restaurant?

19:30.252 --> 19:31.086
Fair.

19:31.795 --> 19:35.132
Look, I only ask because
Cooper and I were chatting with Camille

19:35.883 --> 19:38.719
and it seems like she misses you.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.722
And could do with a little bit of romance.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.266
Did Emily send you to say this?

19:44.349 --> 19:45.309
What? No.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.227
No, this is mate to mate.

19:47.311 --> 19:52.441
Well. Thanks for your concern,
but Camille and I are good.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.319
We are.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.613
Maybe we've slipped into
a predictable rhythm

19:57.696 --> 20:00.115
since she moved in,
but we're in a good place.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.951
And I'd love to go to shows
and take her out for dinner,

20:03.035 --> 20:04.786
but after being here all day,

20:04.870 --> 20:07.664
the last thing I want to do
is go to another restaurant.

20:10.083 --> 20:10.918
Then don't.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.181
Hey, I got your messages. What's up?

20:24.264 --> 20:25.641
Last night's show was good?

20:25.724 --> 20:28.477
-Good? You were amazing.
-And so were you.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.811
I'm happy to help where I can.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.022
So I'm probably
being overly superstitious,

20:32.105 --> 20:34.358
but I want to repeat
everything I did last night.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.817
-Okay.
-Okay, great.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.861
You mean everything you did last night?

20:37.945 --> 20:39.780
I can't go on until I get off.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.365
But what? Here? Now?

20:41.448 --> 20:43.408
-They double-booked my dressing room.
-Right.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.662
-What, you don't want to?
-I want to.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.622
Yeah, it's just that…

20:49.122 --> 20:51.500
Wait a sec… Okay, let's do this. In here.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.293
[Mindy] You have to unzip me.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.722
My swollen ankles
are not going to miss those stairs.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.683
Is Henri finally fixing the elevator?

21:07.766 --> 21:10.560
No. We are vacating this office.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.063
I told Gilbert Group
I wanted to break the lease

21:13.146 --> 21:15.023
and they fully supported my decision.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.819
Really? I always liked this place.

21:18.902 --> 21:19.736
Well, I hate it.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.490
We'll work out of my hotel
until we can find a suitable place.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.493
Come on, girlie, pack up your stuff.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.247
Let's get out
of this bird-infested armpit.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.550
Let's go.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.819
[in French] It's handled, madame.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.160
[in English] I'm still picturing you
chasing that pigeon around.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.328
I mean, what a gift.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.705
I swear, Alfie,
it was, like, the size of an eagle.

22:11.788 --> 22:12.664
[laughs] What?

22:12.748 --> 22:15.792
It's going to be so weird
not working in that office anymore.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.587
Since moving to Paris,
it was kind of like my second home.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.590
Yeah, well, you work too much.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.468
And I thought this was your second home.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.345
I mean, you sure are here a lot.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.804
No more than you.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.557
Touché.
Shall we pop in for a nightcap?

22:31.308 --> 22:33.018
Yeah. Let's pop in.

22:35.854 --> 22:36.730
[laughs]

22:36.813 --> 22:38.440
[in French] I refuse to…

22:38.732 --> 22:40.442
Oh. <i>Bonsoir.</i>

22:40.525 --> 22:41.902
[in English] So, still open?

22:42.486 --> 22:45.739
I should have put a sign out.
It's just a table for two tonight.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.075
Very smooth, mate.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.242
I thought so too.

22:49.951 --> 22:53.705
Well, sorry for the interruption.
Enjoy your romantic dinner.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.875
Just don't send any of the dishes back
to the chef. He hates that.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.126
[both chuckle]

22:58.418 --> 22:59.252
Okay.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.005
Bye.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.549
-[in French] Leave me some.
-Classic.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.512
-[in English] They seem good.
-Yeah. They do.

23:08.595 --> 23:12.265
I mean, when guys pull a move like that…
Someone's getting lucky tonight.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.350
Oh…

23:13.433 --> 23:14.559
He's not the only one.

23:22.025 --> 23:22.901
What about Mindy?

23:22.984 --> 23:24.736
She'll be at the club until 1:00.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.405
Now suddenly I love jazz.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.447
[both laugh]

23:30.992 --> 23:31.910
Okay.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.829
-Ow!
-Oh, my God.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.541
[Mindy] <i>Whoo!</i>

23:37.624 --> 23:38.959
[doing vocal exercises]

23:41.253 --> 23:42.295
[knocking on door]

23:42.671 --> 23:45.048
Finally. I was beginning to think
that you weren't--

23:45.132 --> 23:46.425
These are from Benoît.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.177
He said he's sorry,
but he can't make it tonight.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.475
<i>Merde.</i>

23:56.017 --> 23:56.977
Are you okay?

23:57.477 --> 23:58.728
Anything I can do?

24:00.730 --> 24:01.648
No, I'm good.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.650
Okay.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.747
-Hey. I…
-[doll squeaks]

24:18.498 --> 24:20.917
I was going to take the stairs,
then I saw the elevator.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.669
-What a luxury.
-Yeah.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.296
Where's Jack?

24:24.379 --> 24:26.882
Josette, the au pair,
took him out for a walk.

24:27.382 --> 24:30.635
In his stroller.
He can't walk. Obviously.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.012
Okay.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.098
I set up a meeting with Edgard and Cooper.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.142
I was thinking maybe we could meet them

24:37.225 --> 24:39.728
in this WeWork-y kind of cafe
called Unicorners.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.646
It's in the third, and it's super cute.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.565
-Cancel it.
-Why?

24:47.861 --> 24:48.904
We got Air France?

24:49.488 --> 24:50.989
Oh, my God, that's huge! How?

24:51.072 --> 24:54.409
No, it's my return flight home to Chicago.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.120
I'm flying back tomorrow. With Jack.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.874
-What about--
-I know. I'm going to be that woman.

25:00.957 --> 25:03.043
In business with a crying baby.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.378
It's funny how you become
the things you hate.

25:05.462 --> 25:08.256
Anyway, I booked you a seat too.
In coach, but you can come visit.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.008
Madeline, what's going on?

25:10.091 --> 25:11.843
Well, after learning

25:11.927 --> 25:15.430
that we have no French president
to run our operations here

25:15.514 --> 25:19.184
or any French staff,
next to no clients, and now no office,

25:19.267 --> 25:22.521
the Gilbert Group have decided
to suspend operations here.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.813
We're going home.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.274
I don't understand. What about Savoir?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.734
Well, Savoir is done, hon.

25:27.817 --> 25:31.112
I mean, they may revisit down the line,
but we both know they bought a lemon.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.783
It's a good thing I came to Paris
to uncover the rot.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.577
Insubordination, sweetheart deals.

25:37.661 --> 25:42.749
I ask some reasonable questions
and they all quit.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.919
Because they're afraid
of being exposed for corruption.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.672
It was more nuanced than that.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.549
But you agree?
You'd say that as well?

25:50.632 --> 25:52.259
Why does it matter what I think?

25:52.342 --> 25:55.971
You're going to be scheduled
for a 360 review when we get to Chicago.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.181
-Me?
-You've been here for months.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.225
Emily, I mean, nobody knows

26:00.308 --> 26:03.812
what a disaster this place has been
from the start better than you.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.189
But don't worry, it's not your fault.

26:06.940 --> 26:10.235
Em, it's going to be okay.
You were in over your head, that's all.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.530
We'll figure out what you're going to say
on the plane ride home.

26:28.712 --> 26:29.546
No.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.047
[Madeline] No?

26:31.798 --> 26:32.632
What?

26:35.468 --> 26:37.554
I'm not going back to Chicago.

26:37.637 --> 26:40.265
But… Wait, what are you saying?

26:41.182 --> 26:46.813
I guess I'm saying… I quit.

26:48.481 --> 26:51.776
Emily. Slow down.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.362
Think this through.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.407
Are you sure you want to run away

26:57.490 --> 27:00.243
from everything
that you've worked so hard for?

27:00.785 --> 27:03.413
The raise, the big promotion. Remember?

27:03.496 --> 27:05.332
Madeline, I'm not running away.

27:06.583 --> 27:11.671
I'm running towards the life I want.
And that's here.

27:12.672 --> 27:13.798
In Paris.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.220
I get it, I do.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.350
It's always been a dream of mine
to live and work here.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.101
And I did it.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.436
[laughs]

27:31.900 --> 27:33.109
Have a safe trip home.

27:35.945 --> 27:37.989
Thank you so much for everything.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.077
Hmm.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.545
Agence Grateau.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.005
[in French] I like it.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.216
Thanks, Henri. It's perfect.

27:57.092 --> 28:01.054
So, about our celebratory dinner.

28:01.137 --> 28:03.056
Does Friday work for you?

28:05.433 --> 28:07.102
I wish I could.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.479
But now that my name is on the door,

28:09.562 --> 28:12.524
we need to keep things
professional between us.

28:14.359 --> 28:18.405
But I'll always
cherish the time that we had.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.339
Just as we left it.

28:41.177 --> 28:42.345
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

29:01.823 --> 29:03.908
It's good to be back.

29:04.951 --> 29:05.785
Yes.

29:07.328 --> 29:10.540
It feels like something is missing though.

29:25.930 --> 29:26.931
[laughs softly]

29:48.912 --> 29:50.205
