WEBVTT

00:28.111 --> 00:29.488
[Tony Sr.] Yeah, alright.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.614
That's alright.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.783
That's good. Let's go.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.368
[people chattering]

00:34.451 --> 00:35.577
[man] Let's go. Let's go.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.828
[Tony Sr.] Come on now.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.457
-[music playing]
-[bowling pins thumping]

00:41.291 --> 00:42.376
There you are. Thank you.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.721
[everybody cheering]

00:56.390 --> 00:57.349
Hey...

00:58.559 --> 00:59.518
What's up, Joey?

00:59.977 --> 01:01.019
Detective Vasquez.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.565
-You staying out of trouble?
-Mr. Clean, that's me.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.276
Good luck tonight.
I'm pulling for you guys.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.819
Yeah.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.988
Third place, kind of crazy, right?

01:11.113 --> 01:12.739
[lasers whizzing ]

01:12.864 --> 01:13.824
Look at Big Tony.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.741
Come on.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.368
Hey. Pay attention.

01:16.535 --> 01:19.454
Our fearless Captain.
He'd kill his mother for that trophy.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.664
I wouldn't put it past him.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.962
-No one's going to win that one.
-That's the idea.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.047
I like that little guy.

01:29.798 --> 01:30.882
It's kind of special.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.097
This is our chance--
Cora, come over here.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.098
Alright.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.224
Listen up, guys.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.853
I've been wearing this shirt
for 17 years.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.021
Not consecutively.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.106
Yes, that's true.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.357
Thank you.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.902
But even when I was upstate
on "my little sabbatical,"

01:51.028 --> 01:52.613
I was dreaming of this moment.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.575
What are you doing? What is that?

01:57.159 --> 01:59.202
-A toy.
-He started a toy company.

01:59.328 --> 02:00.912
Is it a toy that can walk down the alley

02:00.996 --> 02:02.706
-and knock over some pins?
-No.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.333
Then it can't help us, can it?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.752
People, please we have to focus.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.879
We're so close to the finals
I can taste it.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.505
it's only a game, Mr. Caruso.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.883
You see that?

02:13.592 --> 02:15.218
That right there is crazy talk.

02:16.428 --> 02:19.014
I wish you people could
hear yourselves sometimes.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.140
I need a drink.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.446
[Tony Sr. cheering]

02:34.529 --> 02:36.239
That's our guy.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.132
Come on, now.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.385
Put it in there.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.136
That looks good.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.681
[everybody cheering]

03:01.431 --> 03:03.016
What did you do your old lady for?

03:03.266 --> 03:05.811
-[man speaking at the same time]
-How much? A million? Two million?

03:06.061 --> 03:08.063
[both yelling]

03:14.236 --> 03:15.821
[Burl] Here we go. Looking again.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.740
[both men grunt]

03:20.117 --> 03:22.035
Fifteen minutes of drinking beer,

03:22.244 --> 03:24.079
ten seconds of physical activity,

03:24.705 --> 03:25.956
greatest game ever invented.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
[grunts]

03:29.126 --> 03:31.628
[Tony Sr.] Come on, baby, let's go now.
Concentrate...

03:33.213 --> 03:36.842
-[Burl] There you go. Oh Yeah!
-That might be the best ball of the night.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.511
Pick that up.

03:46.601 --> 03:47.644

03:49.271 --> 03:51.273
-[chattering]
-[rock music playing]

03:53.066 --> 03:54.860
Stop celebrating and start focusing.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.031
[chattering]

04:00.949 --> 04:02.075
[Tony Sr.] Here we go.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.163
Hey...

04:07.122 --> 04:08.331
What the hell is that?

04:09.583 --> 04:10.834
Not cool, man.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.687
[police siren]

04:33.273 --> 04:35.025
Caruso, thank you for coming.

04:35.150 --> 04:35.984
Of course.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.069
You okay?

04:39.237 --> 04:42.449
Still trying to wrap my head around it.
He's back here.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.494
His name is Joey Wingate. He worked here.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.413
Did the odd jobs...
You know, shoe rentals, cleanup...

04:48.663 --> 04:49.831
Did you know him?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.417
I was his PO for three years.
I got him the job.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.463
They found him back behind the pins.
One round...

04:56.963 --> 04:58.840
point-blank, it was a 9mm.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.303
[groans]

05:04.971 --> 05:05.806
A quarter.

05:06.932 --> 05:07.766
Lucky you.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.393
Look, the ME's ruling suicide, but...

05:11.269 --> 05:14.523
I don't see it.
Maybe I don't want to see it, really.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.107
Did somebody lose a quarter?

05:16.858 --> 05:17.692
Anyone?

05:20.695 --> 05:22.364
Frankie, did you drop a quarter?

05:22.531 --> 05:24.950
Caruso, it's a quarter.
Forget about the quarter. Just keep it.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.536
Keep it?

05:28.370 --> 05:30.705
That's what people do, I mean,
normal people.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.375
[TJ sighs]

05:33.750 --> 05:36.002
Look, I was talking to-- Hello?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.797
Joey. I was talking to Joey
about an hour ago.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.383
He was filling with claw machine.
He was fine.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.513
-I'm going to leave it at the front desk.
-Wait a minute. Let me look at that.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.517
You know what? It's my quarter,
I remember now.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.602
Must have dropped it over there.

05:52.811 --> 05:53.645
Thank you.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.648
[policemen chattering]

06:03.947 --> 06:06.950
-What do you think?
-Self-inflicted.That's where I'm leaning.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.536
Gunshot residue on the glove,
position of the body...

06:13.164 --> 06:15.125
He had another pair of gloves
in his pocket.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.501
The guy had two pair of gloves.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.880
One for work and one for killing himself?

06:21.548 --> 06:22.591
And where are his keys?

06:22.674 --> 06:24.801
-What keys?
-I talked to him an hour ago.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.177
He was wearing a big keyring.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.471
We're going to need a little more time.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.766
Alright, I'll leave these blank for now.
Buy you another day...

06:32.142 --> 06:32.976
But...

06:33.059 --> 06:34.686
this counts as a birthday gift.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.776
-What are you doing tonight?
-What's today, Monday?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.403
-Laundry.
-No, it's Tuesday.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.907
-Laundry.
-No, you're not. You're coming with me.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.702
We're going to Joey's apartment.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.913
No, Cora you can't.
It's not an official homicide.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.165
-You need a warrant.
-I'm two steps ahead of you.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.918
His niece owns the building.
I already talked to her.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.586
She's letting us in.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.129
Nice and legal.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.132
It's dark out there,
better bring your halo.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.426
"Bring your halo..."

07:08.345 --> 07:09.179
That is funny.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.483
Thank you.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.570
[TJ sighs]

07:25.820 --> 07:26.988
Looks like a real apartment.

07:27.739 --> 07:28.990
Only smaller and...

07:30.533 --> 07:31.451
crappier.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.370
A little respect.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.121
He's not even cold yet.

07:38.959 --> 07:39.918
He was a reader.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.296
True Crimes.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.224
I don't see a note.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.685
They don't always leave one.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.603
In fact, they rarely do.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.816
-[traffic]
-[police siren]

08:10.699 --> 08:11.533
Caruso.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.954
Someone must have been here.
They were looking for something.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.331
-How do you figure?
-He loved his mother.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.793
He was obsessed with her.
He'd never leave her picture like this.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.503
Maybe.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.673
And look at this... Pants pockets?

08:28.258 --> 08:30.301
Whatever they were looking for
must have been small.

08:31.136 --> 08:31.970
Maybe.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.057
Would you stop saying "Maybe"?
You're driving me nuts.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.227
How'd they get in?

08:40.270 --> 08:43.023
-All the windows were locked.
-They had a key, remember?

08:47.569 --> 08:48.403
Maybe.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.115
[people chattering]

08:52.907 --> 08:54.659
-It's not personal.
-The hell, it isn't.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.244
"After thorough review,

08:56.327 --> 08:58.121
our initial findings are unchanged."

08:58.204 --> 09:01.082
They're still ruling it a suicide.
They didn't even read my report.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.960
It's been ever, thus. They're just worried
about their clearance rate.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.630
[Tony Sr.] Now, at least we can move on,
and get back to what's really important.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.883
Winning the semi-finals on Friday night.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.676
We've got to keep the pressure on.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.720
We've got to make
those early frames count.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.805
Tony, we're not talking about bowling now.

09:16.639 --> 09:20.477
Joey Wingate was my first client.
I promised him I would take care of him.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.188
-So it's a maternal thing.
-It's not a maternal thing.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.107
It's a justice thing. I'd do the same
thing for any one of you, even him.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.901
[clears throat] Well, thank you.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.570
Hey, look. I didn't know the guy.
I'd seen him around.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.655
I'd seen him cleaning the men's room.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.200
Obviously, he loved the game.
He loved bowling.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.368
And I think
the best way to honor his memory

09:37.452 --> 09:40.413
would be to go out
and win those semi-finals on Friday night.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.873
How about we honor his memory

09:41.956 --> 09:43.917
by finding the son of a bitch
who killed him?

09:44.292 --> 09:45.418
That could work too.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.922
I have been studying
the surveillance footage from the alley,

09:49.506 --> 09:52.050
Nobody entered or exited the building...

09:52.383 --> 09:53.635
during the tournament.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.262
-So, the shooter was on one of the teams?
-Or he works there.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.556
-What are you proposing?
-An unsanctioned mission.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.266
[TJ laughs] There's no such thing.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.894
[Cora] There is now.
I say we keep bowling...

10:03.645 --> 10:05.271
twice a week, like we normally do.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.399
-I love this plan, we keep bowling.
-There's only one change.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.984
-TJ's on the team.
-Excuse me?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.278
-No!
-Yes. I need you there.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.031
In the tournament.
You're the best investigator we've got.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.449
Time. Bad idea.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.408
-Very bad.
-TJ...

10:17.492 --> 10:20.328
No offense. You suck. He's not an athlete.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.540
He doesn't have any coordination.
He still can't ride a bike.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.667
-That's true.
-It doesn't matter.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.918
It's not about winning.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.962
[Tony Sr.] Wait a minute.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.047
We are in the semi-finals.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.342
We can see the promised land
after 17 years.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.303
And anyway, it's a four man roster.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.764
That's a league rule.
You can't just add another bowler.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.933
-He's taking his place. Ryan you're out.
-Okay.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.185
[Tony Sr.] What do you mean, okay?

10:44.269 --> 10:47.772
I'd rather work on this, anyway.
The toy fair is coming up in five weeks.

10:47.856 --> 10:52.277
-[Cora] Oh, the toy fair.
-Have you ever bowled in your life?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.487
When I was ten, for a birthday party.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.158
I'll call the alley,
tell them to put the bumpers back on.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.789
That's what's wrong with this country
in a nutshell.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.542
You know? I'm supposed to apologize...

11:07.917 --> 11:09.210
for wanting to win.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.463
Let me tell you something.
I refuse to apologize.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.299
[music playing]

11:14.424 --> 11:15.300
You with me?

11:16.134 --> 11:17.844
Absolutely, Mister C.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.138
I mean, after all...
Cora's friend Winston--

11:20.221 --> 11:22.390
-Wingate.
-[Tony Sr.] Wingate. Whatever...

11:22.473 --> 11:25.476
He's gone. The man is dead.
Nothing's going to change that.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.769
The only thing we can change

11:26.853 --> 11:29.439
is who's going to bring home that trophy
Friday night.

11:29.564 --> 11:33.318
And it sure as hell ain't going to be us
with my<i> verkakte</i> son in the lineup.

11:34.861 --> 11:35.904
What is that thing?

11:35.987 --> 11:38.698
I call it Orbo.
It's a remote-controlled ball.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.659
-Orbo?
-Yeah.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.786
-You want to invest?
-Maybe.

11:44.871 --> 11:45.955
[Tony Sr.] It all depends.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.708
On what? The color?
We can change the color.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.501
I don't care about the color.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.046
How big can you make it?

11:55.006 --> 11:57.926
-[balls thumping and rolling]
-[bowling pins clink]

12:03.306 --> 12:06.809
How should I know why he killed himself?
You knew him better than me.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.150
-Was Joey worried about money?
-Probably. You know someone who isn't?

12:15.276 --> 12:16.277
That's a good point.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.158
[players cheering]

12:28.289 --> 12:29.666
Hello baby. How are you?

12:32.460 --> 12:33.753
[humming]

12:36.839 --> 12:38.925
-Where's your remote?
-It's here.

12:39.008 --> 12:39.842
Good.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.762
Mr. Caruso, I'm sorry.
I don't think I can go through with this.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.305
It's not fair to the other bowlers.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.724
Ryan we talked about this.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.351
This is not really cheating.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.270
We're trying
to build up his confidence.

12:50.353 --> 12:53.189
TJ's never bowled before.
It's like training wheels.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.107
I don't know.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.359
Remember, this is not just a game.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.569
This is also a homicide investigation.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.406
We lose tonight, that's it.
We're eliminated. We have to go home.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.409
But, he doesn't even
know what we're doing.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.287
Of course he doesn't know.
Have you met my son?

13:07.370 --> 13:09.372
He'd have an aneurysm
if he thought he was cheating.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.084
Even though he's not. He's not cheating.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.257
-Training wheels.
-That a boy. Alright. Okay. See you.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.728
Terrible thing about Joey Wingate.

13:32.854 --> 13:33.980
Were you working that night?

13:34.731 --> 13:37.442
-Do I know you?
-No, it's my first time here.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.111
No, I... told a lie.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.655
I was here when I was ten
for a birthday party.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.617
Anyway, we were just over there,
my friends and I,

13:46.701 --> 13:49.287
and we were talking about Joey,
so I was curious...

13:49.370 --> 13:51.414
I don't have time for curious.
It's League Night.

13:51.998 --> 13:55.835
Right, but I was just wondering....
if that night you saw anything unusual...

13:56.127 --> 13:58.254
There was blood on the bowling balls.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.672
I would call that unusual.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.216
[girl sighs] What are you drinking?

14:04.052 --> 14:04.927
I don't drink.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.638
Okay. I think we're done here.

14:09.932 --> 14:10.767
Anthony!

14:11.059 --> 14:11.934
You're up.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.019
Come on.

14:13.728 --> 14:14.645
[Tony Sr.] Excuse me.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.273
Excuse me.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.234
-What are you doing?
-I got a ball.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.319
Don't use that.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.321
-Why?
-Because I bought you a ball.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.697
Custom made.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.783
Fifteen pounds. It's perfect.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.496
-"Big Bad Wolf."
-You don't like it?

14:31.621 --> 14:34.624
-I don't think I can live up to it.
-Let's see what happens.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.126
[Ryan huffs and puffs]

14:51.724 --> 14:53.726
[ball thumps]

15:06.489 --> 15:08.366
-[Burl shouts] <i>Wowwww!</i>
<i>-</i>[Tony Sr. laughs]

15:08.533 --> 15:10.118
That is one hell of a hook.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.874
[Tony Sr. laughs] The kid's a natural.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.264
[everybody cheering]

15:43.860 --> 15:45.820
[Cora and Burl cheering and laughing]

15:53.369 --> 15:54.287
Wait a minute.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.288
Where you going?

15:55.955 --> 15:56.873
Are you crying?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.207
I can't do this.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.584
It's so wrong.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.919
-It's just wrong.
-I feel awful too.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.129
I'm sick about it.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.797
But we can't stop now.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.842
If he starts rolling gutter balls now,
how would that look?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.970
People would start asking questions,
maybe examine that ball.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.099
And remember,
this is the Brooklyn Bowling Association.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.642
They don't mess around.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.687
I mean, they'd never believe
Junior wasn't in on it.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.772
They'd break his thumbs, maybe worse.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.066
You can't stop now.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.401
We're in too deep.

16:26.861 --> 16:27.862
We're in too deep.

16:27.945 --> 16:28.946
-Alright.
-Yeah.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.156
-Go back.
-Okay.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.498
[Tony Sr.] Come on, baby,
show them how it's done.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.416
-[Burl] Come on, baby.
-Come on, son.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.418
Oh, yeah.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.295
Come on, TJ.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.305
[Cora screaming]

16:54.472 --> 16:56.474
[everybody cheering]

16:57.183 --> 17:00.478
The big... bad... wolf!

17:00.603 --> 17:02.605
[everybody cheering]

17:04.649 --> 17:06.651
[people yelling]

17:08.945 --> 17:11.822
[officer] I've been bowling my whole life,
never got close to 240.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.369
You might be over-thinking your stroke.
I'll come by a little later and...

17:17.036 --> 17:18.871
-give you a few pointers.
-That would be great.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.415
-We can hit Farrell's after.
-Grab a couple beers.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.543
Or ginger ale. Whatever.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.711
Yeah, I would...

17:25.962 --> 17:27.255
[laughs] I'd like that.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.256
We'll just...

17:28.673 --> 17:29.549
hang out.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.134
No biggie. Just the guys.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.136
[Ryan] Oh, my God.

17:34.679 --> 17:35.596
[Burl] Are you okay?

17:36.430 --> 17:37.515
[Ryan] I'm fine.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.103
You know, I'm still mad at myself
about that third frame.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.106
I really let at 3:10 split just...

17:50.027 --> 17:50.861
getaway.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.613
Yeah, you had one hell of a game.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.657
Talk about beginner's luck.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.411
[Burl] That wasn't luck.
I don't know what the hell that was.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.538
He had one shot, Frame Eight.

18:00.621 --> 18:04.542
The ball was in the gutter.
In the damn gutter.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.586
It hopped out of the gutter...

18:06.669 --> 18:07.837
and made the spare.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.715
It was like a religious experience.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.217
It's all in the topspin.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.052
Well, let's keep our eye
on the prize here.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.889
Are you referring, by chance,
to the BBA tournament trophy?

18:19.098 --> 18:22.518
No, I'm referring to the guy who shot
my friend, Joey Wingate, in the skull.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.520
[policemen chattering]

18:24.645 --> 18:25.980
Listen up.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.107
Joey did a three-year stint
for mail fraud.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.527
He was selling non-existent condos
to little old ladies.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.988
One of them was a widow from Rochester,

18:34.113 --> 18:35.364
Francine Carruthers.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.535
Her nephew is in the league.
Bowling for Coronet Realty.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.494
Nephew?

18:40.995 --> 18:41.829
That's thin.

18:41.912 --> 18:46.709
-I know it's thin, but it's all we've got.
-I do hope you're wrong, Cora.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.712
I'd hate to think a fellow bowler,

18:50.296 --> 18:52.840
a denizen of the lanes,
could do such a thing.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.134
Frankly, it reflects badly on all of us.

18:55.426 --> 18:58.095
[Ryan moans deeply]

19:01.265 --> 19:04.143
-[balls thumping and rolling]
-[bowling pins clink]

19:08.898 --> 19:10.900
[people wooing]

19:14.904 --> 19:16.238
[man] Come on.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.948
[Tony Sr.] Come on, now.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.749
[taps the chalk]

19:36.217 --> 19:39.178
I think you're ready, Anthony.
Could you just roll the ball?

19:47.937 --> 19:48.896
Oh, yeah.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.482
[Burl] <i>Ooooooooooooooooh...</i>

19:53.651 --> 19:54.985
[everybody shout]<i> Yeah!</i>

19:55.236 --> 19:56.654
[everybody cheering]

19:56.737 --> 20:00.199
[Tony Sr.] Look at him!

20:03.035 --> 20:06.372
Aunt Francine?
I haven't seen her since my confirmation.

20:06.455 --> 20:10.584
-She didn't even come to my wedding.
-So you have no idea Joey ripped her off?

20:10.668 --> 20:12.753
No, ma'am.
It's the first I'm hearing of it.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.632
So, where were you when he was killed?

20:16.882 --> 20:18.843
[laughs] I was standing right there.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.095
Hold on. I can prove it.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.104
That's the gunshot.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.483
-I'd like a copy of that, if I could.
-Excuse me.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.778
Whatever this is, can it wait?
This game's do or die for us.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.864
I was just leaving.
I'm Detective Vasquez.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.699
Just asking some questions
about Joey Wingate.

20:41.782 --> 20:45.202
What kind of questions? It was a suicide,
right? That's what everybody says.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.913
We still have to do the paperwork.
Just a formality.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.832
I don't understand,
are you bowling or working?

20:50.791 --> 20:54.170
A little of both, I guess.
I don't believe we've met.

20:54.295 --> 20:55.296
Lionel Sykes.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.381
Lenny to my friends.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.009
So you're the captain of the team?

21:00.301 --> 21:02.511
Congratulations,
you guys have had a hell of a season.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.639
We thought so too,
until Cinderella showed up out of nowhere.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.018
[TJ yells and laughs]

21:09.477 --> 21:12.313
-What's his secret?
-Clean living.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.607
If that's the case,
it's too late for me.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.362
Let's go. Come on, son.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.489
Is he the guy?

21:21.739 --> 21:24.200
[huffs]
It's a dead end. His alibi is airtight.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.875
-That's a first.
-How's the rookie of the year doing?

21:33.083 --> 21:35.711
-I think he just ran out of luck.
-Come on, get some of it.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.553
[Burl grunts loudly and laughs]

21:46.347 --> 21:48.140
[everybody cheering]

21:49.892 --> 21:51.268
My world makes no sense.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.938
Big... Bad... Wolf!

22:05.491 --> 22:07.827
[Tony Sr.]
That's the way. There's one. There it is!

22:08.869 --> 22:12.164
-[everybody cheering]
-[Cora] That was pretty good.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.833
Let's go.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.545
Come on, T.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.505
[Cora] Wiggle it out.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.340
[Burl] What kind of wolf is it?
A bad wolf.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.892
[everybody cheering]

22:36.063 --> 22:37.690
[Tony Sr.] Yeah, that's good.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.449
Farrell's, to win.

22:48.742 --> 22:49.994
Betting on your own team?

22:51.161 --> 22:53.581
Why? You know something we don't?

22:55.249 --> 22:56.208
Just feeling lucky.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.420
-You ever get that feeling?
-Bubala, I'm a bookie.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.297
I can't afford to feel lucky.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.048
Farrell's to win.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.349
-Caruso...
-Not a good time, Cora.

23:12.433 --> 23:13.809
I know how Joey got the gun.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.145
My friend at Verizon finally
coughed up his phone records.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.480
Do you remember Nolan Zander?

23:18.981 --> 23:22.151
Handguns 'R Us?
Joey called them four times last month.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.110
Cora...

23:23.444 --> 23:25.154
He hangs out at the gym
on Barrister Street.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.989
He's probably there right now.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.117
Cora, I guess you have not noticed,
I have a perfect game going.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.330
[huffs and yells]
<i>Whooooo's ready for The Wolf?</i>

23:34.622 --> 23:36.624
[everybody cheering]

23:38.459 --> 23:39.835
Get your marshmallows,

23:39.919 --> 23:42.087
because I am on fire.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.505
Go get it, baby.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.384
Come to Papa, heel.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.427
Heel.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.557
[everybody yelling and cheering]

23:55.309 --> 23:57.728
Tony Sr. laughing

23:58.979 --> 24:00.064
[TJ] I can't believe it.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.484
Dad.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.990
Okay, let's go. Wolf, wolf! Yeah.

24:10.157 --> 24:13.619
[everybody] Wolf, wolf, wolf!

24:15.079 --> 24:16.121
[TJ] Thank you very much.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.248
[girls courting TJ]

24:21.502 --> 24:23.295
Sure, you can take a selfie.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.675
-Stay in school.
-[girls shout] Smile!

24:27.758 --> 24:28.717
Don't do drugs.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.846
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you so much.

24:33.430 --> 24:36.141
-[girls imitate wolf]
-[TJ imitates and roars]

24:37.559 --> 24:39.311
[TJ] I'm only one man. Please.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.438
Thank you, ladies.

24:42.982 --> 24:43.816
Ginger ale?

24:44.233 --> 24:45.776
with... a straw?

24:47.444 --> 24:49.780
-How did you know?
-I've been paying attention.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.365
It's kind of hard not to.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.868
-Would you like an autograph?
-[girl chuckles]

24:56.328 --> 24:58.622
I think I might need
more than an autograph.

24:58.706 --> 24:59.581
[tin clicks]

25:06.463 --> 25:07.297
Hey.

25:08.007 --> 25:08.882
Hey.

25:11.385 --> 25:12.261
What's this?

25:13.012 --> 25:13.971
It's a trophy case.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.516
Where's it going to go?

25:25.149 --> 25:25.983
Right here.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.611
I want it to be the first thing you see
when you walk downstairs.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.405
[laughs] The first thing I see...

25:32.448 --> 25:35.367
I  want you to be proud of me.
I know how...

25:36.035 --> 25:39.413
disappointed you were
that I never played sports.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.293
-You don't think I was proud of you?
-Dad, come on.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.588
Do you remember when I quit Little League?

25:47.838 --> 25:50.716
You made me put my arm in a cast,
so you could tell people I got hurt.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.719
You took it off,

25:53.802 --> 25:54.636
I remember that.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.514
Eleven years old, you wouldn't play along.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.349
There'll be plenty of trophies now.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.522
It's like that movie <i>Pinocchio,</i> you know?

26:06.106 --> 26:07.024
That's how I feel.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.068
"Like a real boy."

26:15.157 --> 26:16.033
What's this?

26:17.451 --> 26:19.203
I bought a second one, you know...

26:19.703 --> 26:20.579
for next year.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.039
Yeah.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.759
Don't you think it's fascinating?

26:34.510 --> 26:35.719
He went his whole life.

26:36.053 --> 26:39.139
He had a gift, a gift for bowling...
and never knew it.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.602
Maybe I could play the bassoon.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.357
Maybe I'm the world's greatest bassoonist,
but I just don't know it.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.526
I just don't recognize him anymore.

26:50.734 --> 26:51.568
Who's that?

26:51.902 --> 26:52.736
TJ.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.156
He used to be
a little tightly-wound, but...

26:56.740 --> 26:57.866
he was the real thing.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.744
The last honest man.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.830
Now it's all about how tight the lane is,

27:02.913 --> 27:05.415
and, "Where am I gonna put
all my trophies?"

27:05.541 --> 27:08.544
And, "Did you see
how that last ball hooked?

27:10.254 --> 27:12.422
And... "You'll never bowl as good as me,

27:12.506 --> 27:14.758
because bowling like I bowl,
it can't be taught."

27:14.842 --> 27:15.801
It's instinctive.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.428
Like playing the bassoon.
It can't be taught.

27:18.637 --> 27:22.891
He's become so self-centered and awful,
I could almost picture myself dating him.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.518
So go out with him.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.689
I don't go out
with people I would go out with.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.358
Those days are over.

27:34.987 --> 27:35.821
There he is.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.740
-There he is.
-Yes.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.077
[Burl clears throat]

27:48.000 --> 27:49.334
Should we pick him up now?

27:50.794 --> 27:52.546
[Cora] No, I want to see where he lives.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.465
Something I've got to tell you,
like a heads up...

27:56.466 --> 27:57.301
What's that?

27:57.676 --> 27:58.635
I don't run.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.971
You don't run. What does that mean?

28:01.471 --> 28:03.348
Just so you know, if he takes off...

28:05.434 --> 28:07.811
-What's that, like, your policy?
-Exactly.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.856
-What if he's getting away?
-We get him tomorrow.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.316
Or we get somebody else.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.109
There's always somebody else.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.361
What kind of cop are you?

28:16.528 --> 28:17.362
Tired.

28:24.786 --> 28:25.621
Good luck.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.707
Zander. Stop!

28:29.041 --> 28:31.043
-[tires squeak]
-[car honk]

28:47.559 --> 28:49.561
[gasps and grunts]

28:51.396 --> 28:52.231
We got him.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.361
Recognize this?

28:59.821 --> 29:01.240
Wasn't just the phone calls.

29:01.949 --> 29:05.118
Joey had a box of shells in his pocket
with your prints on it.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.788
You've got to wipe the prints
off the box, man.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.041
-[Burl] That's gun dealing 101.
-[Cora] Nolan, look at me.

29:11.959 --> 29:12.793
Hi.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.712
Rudy Ferranta in the DA's office
has a shovel in his hands.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.047
He wants to bury you.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.007
You sold this piece.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.343
You sold it to Joey Wingate.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.097
He said he needed it.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.849
-For protection.
-Protection from who?

29:28.558 --> 29:29.393
He didn't say.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.395
He said he found something.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.772
-He was scared.
-Found something?

29:33.855 --> 29:35.232
-Money?
-He didn't say.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.818
All I know is he said he found something.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.027
Something.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.905
Said it was like winning the lottery.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.283
I want Caruso to hear this.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.619
Don't go anywhere.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.042
Hey, where is Caruso?

29:54.751 --> 29:56.461
He left about 20 minutes ago.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.421
He left?

29:58.005 --> 30:01.008
He said he was following his... bliss.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.593
He was acting all strange.

30:04.928 --> 30:05.804
He hugged me.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.307
[policemen chattering]

30:15.230 --> 30:17.232
[phone ringing]

30:27.117 --> 30:28.035
No.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.288
Wait... what?

30:32.164 --> 30:33.498
I'm quitting the force.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.084
I'm going to become a professional bowler,
full-time.

30:36.209 --> 30:39.296
Hold on. Let's hold on here a minute.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.257
Tap the brakes.
Who else have you told about this?

30:42.799 --> 30:43.633
Nobody.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.218
Then it's not official.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.804
I'm gonna wait
until I win the tournament tomorrow,

30:47.888 --> 30:48.847
but my mind's made up.

30:48.930 --> 30:49.848
No, it's not.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.225
-Yes, it is.
-No it's not.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.687
-There are factors to consider here.
-Like what?

30:56.188 --> 30:57.022
Factors.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.982
We have factors.

30:59.775 --> 31:03.362
Son, you've worked so hard
to get to where you are.

31:03.737 --> 31:07.949
I mean, you're the lead investigator
on the All-City Homicide task force.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.285
There are ten other detectives
that can do my job.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.621
-I work with two of them.
-That is not true.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.749
You have the best clearance rate
in the city. You have a gift.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.793
Dad, this is my gift.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.379
Okay? Bowling is my gift.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.548
I'll be honest with you,
I don't even know how I do it.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.635
It's like Divine intervention.
That's my only explanation.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.678
-Oh, my God.
-When I'm on the line...

31:30.180 --> 31:31.515
the ball is in my hand...

31:32.808 --> 31:33.809
I feel it.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.937
I am His instrument.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.564
[Tony Sr. groans heavily]

31:41.149 --> 31:43.860
-Oh, my gosh.
-Are you okay?

31:44.319 --> 31:46.488
I need a minute. I need a minute to think.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.240
I've got a big decision to make.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.909
It's not your decision, Dad.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.994
In a way it is.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.080
It's what Mom would have wanted.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.666
Right? Find your bliss. Follow it.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.501
Alright.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.296
[sighs] Look...

32:05.340 --> 32:06.925
I've got to tell you something.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.847
There's a reason
you can't be a professional bowler.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.641
I know what you're going to say.
It's my pension, right?

32:14.724 --> 32:16.977
-I'd be throwing it all away.
-There is that.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.395
Well, Dad...

32:19.938 --> 32:20.772
you can relax.

32:21.398 --> 32:22.899
Okay? I've done my homework.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.652
I'm bowling 285 a game. That's my average.

32:25.819 --> 32:26.987
I keep that pace up...

32:27.904 --> 32:30.240
I'll see two million dollar
my first season of the circuit.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.285
-Two million?
-More if you include endorsements.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.081
We're going to need a good accountant.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.584
In other words, the government
takes half your money.

32:40.709 --> 32:44.087
-I've got a guy, let me call him.
-You can't use your guy.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.630
-Why not?
-We're not using your guy.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.641
[bottles clinking]

33:04.816 --> 33:07.277
-[woman] Did you sleep here?
-Yeah, I guess I did.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.447
[man] Tough night?
You need a ride home?

33:10.572 --> 33:11.490
I'm good.

33:14.993 --> 33:15.827
What do you think?

33:16.495 --> 33:18.705
We've got reporters
coming from miles around.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.540
Everybody wants to see your boy.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.459
You must be excited, too.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.628
[huffs] Me?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.213
You're his number one fan.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.507
Same seat every day.
You can't take your eyes off him.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.550
His biggest fan?

33:31.176 --> 33:32.761
Oh, my God.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.096
After today, you'll probably
be farting through silk.

33:35.639 --> 33:36.848
I heard he's going pro.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.767
Big national tour.
Thirty-seven states.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.811
-Not without me he's not.
-Are you his good luck charm?

33:41.978 --> 33:43.230
[Ryan laughs]

33:43.522 --> 33:44.814
I need a bigger wrench for this.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.275
Look in that box, will you?

33:48.860 --> 33:49.694
It's locked.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.115
That was Joey's box.
Why in hell would he lock it?

33:54.282 --> 33:56.284
[shakes locker]

34:15.470 --> 34:17.556
[Cora] Good work, Detective.
You cracked the case.

34:17.681 --> 34:18.515
We know this guy.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.934
Yeah, that's Lionel Sykes.
He's in the tournament.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.310
He bowls for Coronet Realty.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.479
I knew there was something hinky
about him.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.107
[grunts] What the heck?

34:27.190 --> 34:29.276
This is gross. Did he do that?

34:29.359 --> 34:31.903
Cops in Philly thought so,
but they couldn't prove it.

34:32.737 --> 34:36.825
There's no physical evidence.
Joey was a true crime fanatic.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.494
He must have read about the case
and then recognized Sykes.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.746
So, he recognized him?

34:42.706 --> 34:44.874
Yeah, you're right.
There had to be something more.

34:49.296 --> 34:51.089
Joey had to have found something.

34:51.756 --> 34:54.384
A piece of evidence tying Sykes
to his wife's murder.

34:57.971 --> 35:00.557
Then, knowing Joey, he must have
tried to shake him down.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.566
That old fool.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.110
At least we know where to find him.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.904
He's bowling against us
in the finals tomorrow night.

35:15.697 --> 35:16.531
Sudden death.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.575
Sudden death, that's appropriate.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.952
Should we tell the lieutenant?

35:21.411 --> 35:22.704
-I just did.
-[incoming text]

35:22.954 --> 35:24.080
What did he say?

35:29.252 --> 35:31.504
He said right now the only case
he's interested in

35:31.588 --> 35:33.256
is his new trophy case.

35:33.965 --> 35:39.179
Welcome to this,
the finals of the BBA Championship.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.097
Tonight Farrell's Bar taking on

35:41.181 --> 35:43.683
the defending champs
from Coronet Realty.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.019
Let's meet the team captains.

35:46.603 --> 35:47.520
Gentlemen...

35:48.021 --> 35:52.233
Tony Caruso,
AKA Big Tony to his friends,

35:52.442 --> 35:54.444
of which I'd like to think that I'm one.

35:54.611 --> 35:57.113
And of course, we've got Lionel Sykes
from Coronet Realty.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.990
Tony, the big story tonight...

35:59.074 --> 36:00.992
your son,Tony Junior,

36:01.076 --> 36:03.161
joining the team
just three short weeks ago,

36:03.244 --> 36:04.704
as a replacement bowler,

36:04.954 --> 36:07.123
and like the proverbial bat out of hell,

36:07.207 --> 36:10.168
has dominated, ever since,
propelling this team

36:10.251 --> 36:11.544
almost single-handedly

36:11.628 --> 36:13.713
to the championship match tonight.
What do you think?

36:14.214 --> 36:17.509
All I can say is he's a good boy
and I couldn't be prouder of him.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.928
Did you take him bowling as a kid, or...

36:20.887 --> 36:22.138
No, not really.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.557
Maybe he picked it up
while you were in prison.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.102
Yeah, maybe he did.

36:27.310 --> 36:31.022
[laughs] The trash-talking has begun.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.359
Our first frame in this
winner-take-all tournament,

36:34.526 --> 36:35.902
is coming up next.

36:37.153 --> 36:39.030
Guys, huddle up. Let's go.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.907
[people cheering]

36:41.074 --> 36:44.703
Alright, listen...
This is my last game as an amateur.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.913
I do not want to go home a loser.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.333
So, let's get out there, let's focus...
Let's take it to the basics.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.670
Loomis, you're still releasing soon,
that's why you've been hooking.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.965
Cora... a little tentative on that line.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.134
It's a slick alley,
you can amp it up a bit.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.595
Cora? What did I just say?

37:04.055 --> 37:06.057
You said you used to have
your priorities straight,

37:06.141 --> 37:07.851
but now you're a bit of a jerk.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.311
I know you guys
think this is funny, but...

37:10.437 --> 37:12.897
This championship means a lot
to my father and...

37:13.148 --> 37:13.982
it means a lot to me.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.862
I'll be honest with you guys.
My back hurts from carrying this team.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.280
Say that again.

37:21.698 --> 37:22.866
You heard me.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.119
[Cora] Your back hurts from carrying...

37:26.244 --> 37:27.412
What was it?

37:28.455 --> 37:29.831
From carrying this team.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.126
I'm done here.

37:35.044 --> 37:35.879
Nice talk.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.255
Thanks.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.424
[people chattering]

37:42.469 --> 37:44.429
There you are. I was getting worried.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.181
-How are you feeling?
-Bad.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.850
That's just your conscience.
Don't worry, it'll pass.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.019
Great news. I talked to Junior.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.979
He said you can go with him on tour

37:53.062 --> 37:54.647
-as his ball boy.
-What's that?

37:54.731 --> 37:56.983
It's like a caddie, except for bowling.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.694
I already have a job.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.030
I took care of that.
I called the department.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.782
-You're on paternity leave.
-What?

38:03.865 --> 38:07.535
Yeah, you know that nice Asian girl
who works at Petsmart on Temple Street?

38:07.619 --> 38:09.162
-No.
-Well, you knocked her up.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.707
Have you ever heard
of Lance Armstrong, Mr. Caruso?

38:12.916 --> 38:14.834
Ryan, how many roommates do you have?

38:15.126 --> 38:16.711
-Three.
-Three roommates...

38:16.961 --> 38:19.005
and a student loan the size of Delaware.

38:19.255 --> 38:22.717
Listen to me, I'm going to be handling
all of TJ's merchandising.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.262
And I'm going to put some side bets down,
of which you are entitled to half.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.807
You're going to walk away
with maybe $50,000.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.184
Some things in life
are more important than money.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.603
Yeah, that's true,
but those things cost money.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.194
It's not there.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.196
Excuse me?

38:43.321 --> 38:45.782
Whatever you're looking for,
it's not there. I've checked.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.784
I thought I left my phone.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.245
You're not looking for your phone, Lionel.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.374
Joey Wingate knew you murdered your wife,
and so do I.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.168
That's a very serious accusation,
Detective Vasquez.

38:58.253 --> 39:01.756
-I was never indicted in Philadelphia.
-Well, welcome to Brooklyn.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.425
[presenter speaking loud]

39:04.759 --> 39:07.095
Joey found something.
He was shaking you down.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.304
What was it?

39:09.639 --> 39:14.102
That's what I'm talking about, bowlers.
To your lanes. We are ready to roll.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.061
That's our cue.

39:16.646 --> 39:17.772
Good luck, Detective.

39:20.942 --> 39:21.860
[man] Go, Tony.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.325
[everybody cheering]

39:40.169 --> 39:41.796
[presenter] Tony, Jr. now on the line.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.382
This guy's emergence
has been unbelievable.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.593
A pretty distinctive approach.

39:48.469 --> 39:52.515
Look at the action on that ball.
It's as if it had eyes.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.644
[everybody cheering]

39:57.103 --> 39:58.187
[presenter] And he nails it.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.397
[TJ] My house now.

39:59.480 --> 40:00.648
You are in my house.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.279
[claws whiz]

40:11.034 --> 40:11.910
[girl] Oh!

40:12.869 --> 40:13.786
Heartbreaker.

40:14.579 --> 40:18.625
I knew a guy who used to work here.
He said that bunny is very special.

40:24.380 --> 40:28.551
[Tony Sr.] Let's go now, Burl.
Come on, Burl. That's a good bowl!

40:28.635 --> 40:30.428
That's a good bowl. Yeah.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.555
[everybody cheering]

40:35.642 --> 40:37.310
-Hi.
-Hello.

40:38.353 --> 40:41.272
-You really like that bunny.
-The lady said it was special.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.446
Come on, come on...

40:50.114 --> 40:50.949
Yes.

40:53.743 --> 40:54.744
Congratulations.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.663
-Thanks.
-That was good.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.206
[girl giggles]

40:58.539 --> 40:59.374
Can I see that?

40:59.582 --> 41:01.042
-Sure.
-That's really cool.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.337
Bowl on three. Ready.
One, two, three.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.421
-Bowl!
-Bowling!

41:12.595 --> 41:13.429
Hey.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.682
-Hi.
-What happened to your bunny?

41:16.057 --> 41:17.100
That man traded me.

41:17.934 --> 41:19.477
He gave me his watch.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.145
Isn't it cool?

41:21.270 --> 41:23.272
[people chattering]

41:27.360 --> 41:29.195
Well folks, as it often does,

41:29.278 --> 41:31.823
it all comes down to this:

41:32.031 --> 41:33.324
the final frame.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.076
Coronet Realty up by two.

41:35.284 --> 41:38.329
This is their last chance
to build on that lead.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.598
Tough break for Coronet Realty.

41:57.974 --> 42:00.768
Sykes psyched himself out
on that one for sure.

42:00.977 --> 42:04.147
Team Farrell's now has a chance
to clinch it all,

42:04.480 --> 42:06.774
as Tony Junior comes to the line.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.110
All we need is three pins to clinch it.

42:09.610 --> 42:10.445
Three pins.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.071
[takes a deep breath] Three pins.

42:12.822 --> 42:13.990
I think I can handle that.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.246
Son.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.206
I love you, Son.

42:22.457 --> 42:23.583
I love you too, Dad.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.130
[pants]

42:34.886 --> 42:36.888
[both grunt]

42:39.307 --> 42:41.059
[Cora shouts] Sykes! Stop him!

42:41.309 --> 42:42.226
This is it, baby.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.228
Come on, let's win it now.

42:44.854 --> 42:48.483
Wolf, wolf, wolf!

43:10.338 --> 43:11.964
[TJ flashbacks]

43:12.048 --> 43:15.635
<i>I'd rather work on this, anyway.</i>
<i>I've got the toy fair in five weeks.</i>

43:16.677 --> 43:21.015
<i>I bought you a ball. Custom made.</i>
<i>Fifteen pounds, it's perfect.</i>

43:22.391 --> 43:24.393
[ball thumping around]

43:28.439 --> 43:29.816
[grunts] No!

43:31.025 --> 43:33.027
[Ryan imitates machine gun]

43:34.070 --> 43:37.198
[Lionel and Cora grunting]

43:39.951 --> 43:40.827
Nice shot.

43:43.663 --> 43:45.665
[sighs]

44:02.640 --> 44:04.392
Hold on... Breaking news.

44:05.143 --> 44:08.104
DNA test on the tooth,
it was a positive match with Sykes' wife.

44:08.187 --> 44:09.313
Sykes is waiving extradition.

44:09.397 --> 44:11.899
He will be arraigned on Monday
in Philadelphia.

44:11.983 --> 44:14.110
See? We solved the case.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.154
All's well that ends well.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.743
Ouch!

44:24.328 --> 44:26.706
[Tony Sr.] A little help. Hello?

44:27.206 --> 44:29.208
-[music playing]
-[Tony Sr. sighs]

44:31.252 --> 44:33.629
How long are you people
going to stay mad at me?

44:35.381 --> 44:37.425
Come on, haven't I suffered enough?

44:37.967 --> 44:40.928
I got my thumb broke
by Mrs. Spiro's crazy grandson.

44:41.262 --> 44:44.098
It could have been worse.
Thank goodness it was Shabbos.

44:44.557 --> 44:47.643
This one's going to take a while, Tony.
That was a cold thing to do.

44:48.352 --> 44:50.813
That was <i>the </i>meanest thing
you've ever done to me.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.900
-And that's saying a lot.
-Come on.

44:54.150 --> 44:55.193
How was it mean?

44:55.401 --> 44:57.653
You were on top of the world
for three weeks.

44:57.778 --> 45:00.573
Most people never get three minutes.
You're welcome.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.742
I can't help but wonder how you'd do.

45:03.326 --> 45:05.620
You know, bowling for real,
without any help.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.496
I was actually curious too.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.874
I went back yesterday on my own.

45:10.291 --> 45:11.125
Yeah?

45:13.252 --> 45:14.086
And?

45:15.254 --> 45:16.088
I bowled a 92.

45:17.632 --> 45:19.675
That was with the bumpers.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.055
[pops his lips]
Yeah, my bowling days are over.

45:25.097 --> 45:27.391
[sighs] Maybe I'll take up pool.

45:28.809 --> 45:32.605
You know, not for nothing,
but I shoot a pretty good stick.

45:33.272 --> 45:35.399
Maybe it's like apple trees make apples,

45:35.524 --> 45:38.778
you'll be this tremendous pool player.
What do you think? [laughs]

45:40.780 --> 45:41.989
Let's see what you got.

45:53.292 --> 45:54.126
Holy mackerel!

45:54.669 --> 45:55.711
He's a natural.

45:57.588 --> 45:58.923
It's easier than it looks.

46:03.678 --> 46:04.804
I'm going to hell.
