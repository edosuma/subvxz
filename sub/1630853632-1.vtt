WEBVTT

00:33.373 --> 00:34.669
- Then nutty looking lady

00:34.704 --> 00:36.572
that was looking for
her mother in Ireland.

00:36.607 --> 00:40.378
- She is a real
damaged set of goods.

00:40.413 --> 00:43.007
Her father is a Spanish Royal.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.482
Mother left her in Spain.

00:45.517 --> 00:47.418
Lots of incest files.

00:47.453 --> 00:50.322
Uncle was let free
of high crimes.

00:50.357 --> 00:54.084
She went through therapy
as a child, didn't work,

00:54.119 --> 00:57.494
then drugs, then about
a hundred therapists.

00:57.529 --> 01:00.090
Then for some reason,
out of the blue,

01:00.125 --> 01:03.632
she begins an obsessed search
for her mother in Ireland.

01:03.667 --> 01:06.096
She was found at a party

01:06.131 --> 01:09.605
in a trance, that
summer solstice.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.575
So we hired a young,
brilliant Spanish doctor,

01:12.610 --> 01:13.906
speaks the language,

01:13.941 --> 01:16.183
and the doctor in the
hospital in Ireland

01:16.218 --> 01:19.109
has been using
state-of-the-art methods

01:19.144 --> 01:22.222
analyzing the
decoding brainwaves.

01:22.257 --> 01:24.686
This doctor is one of
the best in Europe.

01:24.721 --> 01:27.524
Patient, Jeanie Del Rey.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.858
She has many personalities
inside of her head.

01:31.893 --> 01:34.762
- Madam, I remember seeing
this freaky looking woman

01:34.797 --> 01:37.732
at the summer solstice
in Stonehenge.

01:37.767 --> 01:41.604
- I suggest you
shut your big mouth.

01:41.639 --> 01:44.134
Big sister hears all.

01:44.169 --> 01:46.246
The British military,

01:46.281 --> 01:49.810
the most powerful, most secret,

01:49.845 --> 01:54.144
and most brilliant force
on nature's green earth.

01:54.179 --> 01:56.223
Tail the American!

01:56.258 --> 01:58.951
I want to know who
killed these people.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.195
- Madam, with all due respect,

02:01.230 --> 02:03.890
when did you actually care
about a few dead Irish?

02:05.190 --> 02:06.860
- One of them was
a friend of mine.

02:06.895 --> 02:10.127
We met at Rudlow
Manor on a project.

02:10.162 --> 02:12.767
He was a grand member
of the Golden Dawn.

02:14.001 --> 02:17.244
He is, was, a great scientist.

02:18.203 --> 02:20.280
Find out who killed
our constituents.

03:12.895 --> 03:13.960
- Agent Pietra?

03:13.995 --> 03:15.269
This is Agent Hastings.

03:15.304 --> 03:16.864
Welcome to Ireland.

03:16.899 --> 03:18.701
Hope the ferry ride from
France was not too roughly.

03:18.736 --> 03:20.835
I'm sure you will
be used to the cold

03:20.870 --> 03:23.200
having stationed in New
York for a few years back.

03:23.235 --> 03:25.477
They say that roughly against
most of the sun in Ireland,

03:25.512 --> 03:26.874
which ain't much.

03:26.909 --> 03:29.349
Radio says it's gonna
snow in Wexford today.

03:29.384 --> 03:31.010
You see clear as a fog,

03:31.045 --> 03:33.353
weather has to say its mind
of its own in the Republic.

03:33.388 --> 03:35.949
I know the rental car is
not up to your standards.

03:35.984 --> 03:37.984
For this case we
thought low-profile

03:38.019 --> 03:39.359
might be the best solution.

03:39.394 --> 03:40.250
On your way to Wexford,

03:40.285 --> 03:41.889
make sure you stay on the left.

03:41.924 --> 03:45.090
Plenty of Yanks slam stop
on the roads in the islands

03:45.125 --> 03:46.366
for not staying on the left.

03:46.401 --> 03:50.260
The Iris mostly, well,
they're amiable and 30 so-so.

03:50.295 --> 03:52.163
I have your full report here.

03:52.198 --> 03:56.266
I know you suffered PTSD
from the last case in LA,

03:56.301 --> 03:58.906
when you had the occult
crime unit there.

03:58.941 --> 04:00.941
We know the Persidio case well.

04:00.976 --> 04:03.911
You did a hell of a job on that.

04:03.946 --> 04:05.715
Sorry about the outcome.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.453
Your apartment is on the quay.

04:07.488 --> 04:09.356
Hell of a lot better
than your Rent-A-Car.

04:09.391 --> 04:12.425
They say you're the best
Interpol agent for the job,

04:12.460 --> 04:14.790
especially with your
occult background.

04:14.825 --> 04:16.627
There have been two
murders in five weeks,

04:16.662 --> 04:19.828
similar hocus pocus signs
on the crime scenes.

04:19.863 --> 04:22.567
We've got some great Spanish
lady at the Wexford psyche unit

04:22.602 --> 04:24.261
saying she did the crimes.

04:24.296 --> 04:26.604
Impossible, she's been
locked up for two months

04:26.639 --> 04:28.232
in the looney bin.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.300
Report from Wexford boys
says there has been some,

04:30.335 --> 04:33.446
well let's say,
extranatural intendency

04:33.481 --> 04:35.448
with this nutter in the ward.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.978
From what I hear,
she's a real monster.

04:38.013 --> 04:41.850
There is a brilliant Spanish
doctor, Astrid Thomas.

04:41.885 --> 04:44.182
She's been analyzing
the madwoman.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.283
Said she has over
nine personalities

04:46.318 --> 04:50.463
and that one of those nine
says she did the murders.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.762
The doctor says
she is delusional.

04:52.797 --> 04:54.467
There is a special
priest that has dealt

04:54.502 --> 04:57.635
with criminally insane
over the 30 years.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.967
His name is Father
Malichi Peterson.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.839
Supposedly he can help us
with mysterious symptoms

05:03.874 --> 05:06.446
outside the normal
science approved protocol.

05:06.481 --> 05:08.448
We need to know who
did these murders.

05:08.483 --> 05:10.615
I expect a full
report in one week.

05:37.677 --> 05:38.973
- Yeah, well if
I'm going to go in there,

05:39.008 --> 05:41.239
I need a drink and a
good night's sleep.

05:57.092 --> 05:58.322
- Agent Pietra, you
were supposed to be here.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.664
- Yeah, well look, Doc,

05:59.699 --> 06:00.830
I'm a little jetlagged.

06:00.865 --> 06:02.667
I'll be there tonight
or first thing

06:02.702 --> 06:03.470
in the morning, all right?

06:03.505 --> 06:04.900
Thank you, sorry.

06:54.589 --> 06:55.885
Hello, sir.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.557
- Good afternoon,
sir, how can I help you?

06:57.592 --> 07:00.285
- Yeah, I'm here to have a
visitation with a doctor.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.594
- Okay, no problem.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.387
I'll just give you a
quick sweep if I may.

07:04.225 --> 07:05.422
What's that there, sir?

07:05.457 --> 07:07.897
- Special Agent Charge
Interpol America.

07:07.932 --> 07:09.602
- Oh, no
problem, that's fine, sir.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.427
- Okay.

07:10.462 --> 07:11.604
Here to see the doctor.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.639
- They've all got guns.

07:13.674 --> 07:14.673
Everyone.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.070
All these Americans
have all got guns!

07:16.105 --> 07:17.401
- It's okay.
- It's going crazy.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.007
- Walk steady, Gill,
it's only a man.

07:19.042 --> 07:20.371
It's okay now, you calm down,

07:20.406 --> 07:22.747
let's get you back
in the ward then.

07:22.782 --> 07:24.177
Good man.

07:24.212 --> 07:25.882
- Agent Pietra?

07:25.917 --> 07:26.784
A fellow American?

07:26.819 --> 07:28.918
It's good to meet a fellow Yank.

07:28.953 --> 07:30.557
- Fellow yank, huh?

07:30.592 --> 07:33.417
What the hell are you doing in
this haunted Irish nuthouse?

07:33.452 --> 07:34.660
- Oliver, if you could
please take the agent here

07:34.695 --> 07:35.826
to see Dr. Astrid.

07:35.861 --> 07:36.926
- Yes sir.

07:36.961 --> 07:37.729
- Thank you.

07:37.764 --> 07:38.488
- Thank you, pal.

07:38.523 --> 07:39.731
- You're welcome.

07:39.766 --> 07:41.799
- Oh yeah, to answer
your question.

07:41.834 --> 07:45.572
My mother was Irish and my
father was American like you.

07:46.531 --> 07:49.433
My father was a big ladies man.

07:49.468 --> 07:52.678
So one day, my mother
came to my room.

07:52.713 --> 07:55.681
She told me, you ain't
getting up on the dole.

07:55.716 --> 07:57.650
You gotta get a job, you idiot.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.620
So I figured that there was
only two places for hire,

08:00.655 --> 08:01.621
I looked up.

08:01.656 --> 08:03.821
There was a pizza
joint and a nuthouse.

08:03.856 --> 08:05.559
Can you believe it?

08:05.594 --> 08:09.420
Funny enough, my specialty
was studying mental cases,

08:09.455 --> 08:11.521
since my family was
one.

08:11.556 --> 08:13.666
Did I mention the pay was good?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.492
My girl loves that I work here.

08:15.527 --> 08:18.099
She's a bit of a goth
chick, but you know,

08:18.134 --> 08:21.333
she likes hearing my
stories every night.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.643
- That's a little bit too
much information, all right?

08:23.678 --> 08:25.612
I thought the Irish
hated Oliver Cromwell.

08:25.647 --> 08:27.713
- Fake names
protect us from the nuts.

08:27.748 --> 08:30.276
- I'm here to study a
case, a murder case.

08:30.311 --> 08:32.014
A couple of murders in town,

08:32.049 --> 08:33.983
your little hick
town, all right?

08:34.018 --> 08:37.690
And I need a big file
on this lady here.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.890
I know you know her.

08:39.925 --> 08:42.387
You know this lady, don't you?

08:42.422 --> 08:43.729
- Yeah, I know her.

08:43.764 --> 08:46.600
- Okay well, I need a
lot of information on her

08:46.635 --> 08:47.700
because these
psychiatrists, you know,

08:47.735 --> 08:49.394
they're all bleeding hearts.

08:49.429 --> 08:52.738
It's "My mommy did it, my
daddy did", you know, all that.

08:52.773 --> 08:54.740
I'll give you 50 bucks if
you give me a big file.

08:54.775 --> 08:57.941
- Make it a hundred and
I'll get you a full file.

08:57.976 --> 08:59.569
- What kind of patriot are you?

08:59.604 --> 09:02.682
- My girl, she likes
nice things, you know?

09:02.717 --> 09:04.717
- Yeah, been there, done that.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.015
- Want to take your
jacket off, sir?

09:06.050 --> 09:08.314
It's gonna be warm when
they lock your room.

09:08.349 --> 09:10.756
- I think I'll be just fine.

09:11.759 --> 09:12.791
I'm still cold.

09:27.104 --> 09:28.565
- Gimme my ice pack.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.841
Gimme my ice pack!

09:29.876 --> 09:31.744
Gimme my ice pack!

09:32.747 --> 09:34.747
- Now these three need
to go into their room

09:34.782 --> 09:35.539
by six o'clock.

09:35.574 --> 09:36.474
They get very violent

09:36.509 --> 09:37.607
after that time.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:37.642 --> 09:38.850
- I wanna go home!

09:38.885 --> 09:40.720
- Michael Collins!

09:44.825 --> 09:45.956
- Nice place.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.456
- You're lucky,
it's concert day.

09:55.704 --> 09:57.770
- That's a real nice concert.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.300
- Not really, they play the
same thing every Friday.

10:04.603 --> 10:05.470
- What's that mean?

10:05.505 --> 10:06.273
- Oh, hello.

10:06.308 --> 10:07.780
- Oh, I see.

10:11.115 --> 10:11.883
- What the hell?

10:11.918 --> 10:13.610
It's the same girl.

10:13.645 --> 10:15.216
- No, they're twins.

10:17.022 --> 10:18.417
- But they're too
young to be here,

10:18.452 --> 10:19.319
what the hell did they do?

10:19.354 --> 10:20.892
- Ah, they baked their mother.

10:20.927 --> 10:22.993
- They baked their mother.

10:23.028 --> 10:24.489
All right, I better get
to the doctor's office

10:24.524 --> 10:26.062
before I get murdered.

10:26.097 --> 10:26.832
Which way?

10:26.867 --> 10:28.097
- Ah, right this way.

10:28.132 --> 10:28.900
- Thanks, Logan.

10:30.002 --> 10:31.661
- Oliver.

10:31.696 --> 10:33.300
- Oliver Cromwell, thanks.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.468
- Hey Captain,
look at her teeth.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.271
Look at her teeth.

10:37.306 --> 10:38.173
- Your fucking teeth.

10:43.312 --> 10:44.784
- Gimme something to smoke.

10:44.819 --> 10:48.216
- You remind me of
my son.

10:48.251 --> 10:49.283
- I'm trying to give up,

10:49.318 --> 10:50.856
will you stop asking?

10:50.891 --> 10:51.956
- Well if you stop fucking
grabbing the smokes.

10:51.991 --> 10:53.056
Do you wanna look like that?!

10:53.091 --> 10:54.827
- Girls, settle down, please.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.796
IF you want a smoke,
I'll get you one, right?

10:56.831 --> 10:57.995
- Okay.
- Cool.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.492
- Check him out.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.834
- Already fucking looking.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.066
- I love it.
- I saw him first!

11:03.101 --> 11:04.870
I'll fucking kill you.

11:06.907 --> 11:09.534
- Ah, looks like
it quit snowing.

11:11.010 --> 11:13.340
Hey, what kind of
birdies are you?

11:13.375 --> 11:15.782
I bet you're happy
it stopped snowing.

11:15.817 --> 11:17.674
Freezing your asses up
here in Ireland, huh?

11:17.709 --> 11:18.983
Lovebirds.

11:19.018 --> 11:23.086
Or shall I say genus Agapornis

11:24.320 --> 11:27.024
from the Psittaculidae
family from Africa.

11:27.059 --> 11:29.125
And you're from Madagascar.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.392
Must be great to have
all those cousins, huh?

11:32.427 --> 11:33.327
Oh.

11:33.362 --> 11:35.329
- Impressive, very smart of you.

11:35.364 --> 11:38.299
You know a lot about birds.

11:38.334 --> 11:40.202
Take a seat, please, sir.

11:40.237 --> 11:44.305
- I'm not so smart, I just
read a lot, thank you.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.108
- Mhmm.

11:50.951 --> 11:53.886
Look, the white
bird is the female.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.613
Her name is Joan of Arc.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.923
And the blue one
is her man Freud.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.683
They love each other very much.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.959
- Joan of Arc and Freud, huh?

12:02.457 --> 12:04.963
You know, they say that
lovebirds, they mate for life.

12:06.263 --> 12:09.066
That when one dies,
the other one dies.

12:09.101 --> 12:11.530
- Very romantic, Agent Pietra.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.730
However, every time I
leave on the weekend,

12:13.765 --> 12:16.601
Joan of Arc is pecking
the hell out of Freud.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.273
He was bloody yesterday morning.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.915
- Well, a woman is to be
loved, not understood.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.949
- Sounds familiar.

12:23.984 --> 12:25.247
Mark Twain?

12:25.282 --> 12:28.514
Oh no, my
teacher will murder me.

12:28.549 --> 12:31.385
It's Ireland's
greatest, Oscar Wilde.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.958
But you don't seem
the Wilde type.

12:32.993 --> 12:34.586
He was a very free man

12:34.621 --> 12:38.095
and your reputation is one
of extreme conservatism.

12:38.130 --> 12:39.998
- Oscar Wilde died a Christian.

12:40.033 --> 12:41.967
Not that anyone in
the so-called press

12:42.002 --> 12:43.265
would ever write that.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.598
But for a broken heart,
how could Jesus enter?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.941
That's okay, I'll eat
some garlic later.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.976
Kills vampires too.

12:51.011 --> 12:53.671
- They did say you
were eccentric.

12:53.706 --> 12:56.047
I'm sure you know that
I deal with many more

12:56.082 --> 12:59.347
how should I say,
more challenging test

12:59.382 --> 13:00.744
than your types everyday.

13:01.923 --> 13:03.417
- So they said I
was eccentric, huh?

13:03.452 --> 13:05.749
I guess that's a
double edged sword.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.961
The only thing worse
than being talked about

13:08.996 --> 13:10.787
is not being talked about.

13:10.822 --> 13:12.228
- Wilde again?

13:12.263 --> 13:15.726
I guess you're not only
brilliant, you are obsessive.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.002
An easy observation.

13:18.698 --> 13:22.271
I'm sure it helps you
with investigations.

13:22.306 --> 13:24.878
Like a tiger, I'm
sure you don't let go.

13:26.046 --> 13:27.881
Agent Pietra, I have
read your report

13:27.916 --> 13:29.982
as ordered by Interpol.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.810
And I'm not only supposed to
help you with murder cases.

13:33.845 --> 13:36.351
They directed me to
attempt to help you

13:36.386 --> 13:37.484
with your own demons.

13:38.718 --> 13:39.783
- I don't had demons.

13:40.995 --> 13:43.325
I just got frazzled by
a case a few years back.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.931
A woman like you
who went to Oxford

13:44.966 --> 13:47.032
should know it's PTSD.

13:47.067 --> 13:50.662
- Demons was a figure
of speech, Agent Pietra.

13:50.697 --> 13:54.666
And do I detect a bit of an
inferiority complex here?

13:54.701 --> 13:57.735
'Cause mentioning Oxford
is a clear indication.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.143
There's no need for envy.

13:59.178 --> 14:02.212
You are the one who was
decorated by the President

14:02.247 --> 14:04.115
when you were young in Iraq.

14:04.150 --> 14:05.985
I know you chose that as a way

14:06.020 --> 14:10.187
out of a troubled youth and
prison, very impressive.

14:11.289 --> 14:12.750
- I'm not so impressed.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.654
- I can see you're
still suffering a bit.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.854
Those dark circles
under the eyes,

14:17.889 --> 14:18.998
do you sleep much?

14:20.199 --> 14:21.396
And your hands are shaking.

14:21.431 --> 14:24.201
May I get you a
glass of water or...

14:24.236 --> 14:26.368
- No, I'm okay, I'm fine.

14:27.899 --> 14:30.207
You're a very observant woman.

14:30.242 --> 14:32.869
- Does it make a
difference if I am a woman?

14:32.904 --> 14:35.905
- Oh, here we go again with
this feminist bullshit.

14:35.940 --> 14:38.512
Now look, what is this,
some kind of analyst thing?

14:38.547 --> 14:40.052
Look, I came here to
help with a murder,

14:40.087 --> 14:41.383
not to be analyzed
by some young-

14:41.418 --> 14:42.714
- Chick?

14:42.749 --> 14:44.254
There were called
bears at Oxford.

14:45.455 --> 14:48.357
At least the gentleman
said it in another room.

14:49.921 --> 14:54.935
I'm sure you have at least,
let me, two divorces.

14:56.103 --> 14:56.860
- Three.

14:56.895 --> 14:57.894
What are you, psychic?

14:57.929 --> 15:01.106
- You're the
street smart one here.

15:01.141 --> 15:02.272
Self taught.

15:02.307 --> 15:06.573
May I ask what a GED is?

15:06.608 --> 15:08.740
- General Education Diploma.

15:09.941 --> 15:11.743
Now look, we gotta end
this session, okay?

15:11.778 --> 15:13.052
I know what you're doing,
you're trying to analyze,

15:13.087 --> 15:15.087
you can't analyze a
guy like me, right?

15:15.122 --> 15:15.945
- Pride is a sin.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.914
Lest we forget, Agent Pietra.

15:17.949 --> 15:19.091
- I'm the king of sin.

15:20.325 --> 15:22.193
There's two types of
people in the world.

15:22.228 --> 15:24.294
People that set out to do evil

15:24.329 --> 15:27.066
and people that
set out to do good.

15:27.101 --> 15:28.628
I belong to the latter.

15:28.663 --> 15:31.103
I came here, I wanna figure
out this murder case,

15:31.138 --> 15:34.238
I wanna know what happened
to this Mr. O'Leary.

15:34.273 --> 15:37.802
And what's going on with
this crazy Spanish chick?

15:37.837 --> 15:39.111
No disrespect.

15:40.906 --> 15:44.974
Pretty and wacked, those are
two words I can come up with.

15:45.009 --> 15:48.780
- Lost and abandoned are the
first two that came to mine.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.221
- Figures, bleeding heart.

15:50.256 --> 15:51.486
You think she killed them?

15:51.521 --> 15:52.751
- Impossible.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.984
She has been locked
up here with me

15:55.019 --> 15:57.063
for weeks before the murders.

15:57.098 --> 15:58.427
- You sure you
didn't let her out

15:58.462 --> 16:01.067
on some hippy retreat weekend?

16:01.102 --> 16:05.170
- Oh, your American humor
does not agree with me.

16:05.205 --> 16:06.600
- American, huh?

16:06.635 --> 16:10.076
I guess who has the
inferiority complex now?

16:10.111 --> 16:12.606
- Touche, Agent Pietra.

16:12.641 --> 16:17.479
Look, patient Del Rey
has been very troubled.

16:17.514 --> 16:19.448
But she's not a murderer.

16:19.483 --> 16:20.746
To give you the bottom lines,

16:20.781 --> 16:22.286
I am nearly capable to merge

16:22.321 --> 16:24.453
Jeanie's personalities into one.

16:24.488 --> 16:28.017
I worked months on
it with a combination

16:28.052 --> 16:29.293
of therapy medicine

16:29.328 --> 16:32.890
and state of the art
scanning of brain activity,

16:32.925 --> 16:33.891
I am nearly there.

16:35.136 --> 16:37.994
Just because this is Ireland,
I have to even consider

16:38.029 --> 16:41.239
this insane exorcism that
Father Malichi desires to do

16:41.274 --> 16:42.174
so desperately.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.769
I think it would hurt her

16:43.804 --> 16:46.508
and cause her to split
to even more mask

16:46.543 --> 16:49.280
to protect her original self.

16:49.315 --> 16:52.250
But she's such a sweet person
if one gets to know her.

16:52.285 --> 16:53.779
- Oh yeah, she's
a real sweet kid.

16:53.814 --> 16:56.683
Look at this, she
stabbed her father's hand

16:56.718 --> 16:58.047
with a screwdriver.

16:58.082 --> 17:02.491
She threw two cats in a
fireplace, lucky they got out.

17:02.526 --> 17:07.524
And cut her brother's hair off
when he was four years old.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.465
Yeah, she's a real
winner, this one.

17:10.435 --> 17:12.204
- Agent Pietra, I have studied

17:12.239 --> 17:16.208
multiple personality
disorders my whole life.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.869
- Well that's not very long.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.541
- Long enough to
have two doctorates

17:19.576 --> 17:21.939
at the capacity,
don't you think?

17:21.974 --> 17:23.182
- I feel things.

17:24.581 --> 17:26.218
And that woman is crazy.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.781
She's a real monster,
a real bitch.

17:28.816 --> 17:30.046
- I beg your pardon.

17:30.081 --> 17:31.553
What the hell is
wrong with you, sir?

17:31.588 --> 17:33.357
Don't ever call her
or any woman a bitch

17:33.392 --> 17:35.084
in front of me again.

17:35.119 --> 17:36.723
Do you understand that, sir?

17:38.496 --> 17:40.760
- I stand corrected,
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

17:42.764 --> 17:44.093
Look.

17:44.128 --> 17:45.237
I'm really sorry.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.241
Look, we didn't start
things off right.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.409
You're a very
brilliant young doctor

17:52.444 --> 17:56.105
and I'm an old salty dog who
knows how to figure things out.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.679
Why don't we join forces, huh?

18:01.222 --> 18:04.080
- Okay, your apology accepted.

18:04.115 --> 18:06.621
Agent Pietra, it will be
wise for both our jobs

18:06.656 --> 18:07.490
to move alone.

18:08.757 --> 18:11.923
Jeanie has at least
eight personalities.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.628
And she's not easy to be near.

18:14.829 --> 18:18.094
And I am worried about
your own mental status.

18:18.129 --> 18:21.306
Interpol will approve an
elephant to investigate

18:21.341 --> 18:23.869
if they could close this case.

18:23.904 --> 18:26.839
I think you should be
on some beach somewhere

18:26.874 --> 18:29.215
sipping a pina colada.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.316
I know you have
gone through a lot.

18:31.351 --> 18:33.483
Your work is to be commended.

18:33.518 --> 18:36.145
But this case is
for those who are

18:36.180 --> 18:37.146
more-
- What?

18:37.181 --> 18:38.422
More mentally capable?

18:39.392 --> 18:41.887
I spent three years in Presidio.

18:41.922 --> 18:42.888
You know what that is?

18:42.923 --> 18:44.197
It was a Satanic case.

18:44.232 --> 18:46.331
Three years of my life!

18:46.366 --> 18:48.058
I saw children!

18:48.093 --> 18:49.697
Children were murdered!

18:49.732 --> 18:51.798
You understand this?

18:51.833 --> 18:54.339
It'd shake anybody
to the foundation.

18:54.374 --> 18:57.133
And there was American
Army officers involved.

18:58.312 --> 19:00.609
It shook my foundation,
you understand that?

19:00.644 --> 19:02.314
- You were almost killed.

19:03.515 --> 19:04.811
It must have been
a trying experience

19:04.846 --> 19:07.286
to say the least.

19:07.321 --> 19:10.355
But you are lucky you're alive.

19:10.390 --> 19:13.226
I do respect your
gallantry, Agent Pietra.

19:13.261 --> 19:14.260
I do respect you.

19:15.395 --> 19:17.021
You have gone through a lot.

19:18.222 --> 19:20.629
But sometimes we push
ourselves too much.

19:20.664 --> 19:22.268
And just because
they approve you

19:22.303 --> 19:26.305
doesn't mean in my opinion
that you are up to task.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.836
Look, I have studied two
years just on body language.

19:29.871 --> 19:33.004
And yours are reflections
of major conflict.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.247
- Body language?

19:34.282 --> 19:35.380
I grew up on the
streets of New York.

19:35.415 --> 19:36.282
What do you know
about body language?

19:36.317 --> 19:37.283
You're just a kid!

19:37.318 --> 19:39.846
What can you tell
about my body language?

19:39.881 --> 19:42.145
- Your feet are
pointed for the door.

19:42.180 --> 19:45.390
You want out of here
as fast as you can.

19:45.425 --> 19:46.721
- I told you I wanted
to have a smoke.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.990
- Dr. Thomas, Jeanie
just stabbed another.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.893
- Sandra, are you all right?

19:53.928 --> 19:54.762
- I'll be fine.

19:55.930 --> 19:57.193
Jeanie needs sedating.

19:57.228 --> 19:59.195
You have to sedate her!

19:59.230 --> 20:00.636
- I think I may have
mentioned something

20:00.671 --> 20:02.341
about more security!

20:02.376 --> 20:04.002
And I told you, Doctor!

20:04.037 --> 20:05.674
- Oliver, take care of Sandra.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.005
- She shouldn't have gone.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.347
- Am I too old for this?

20:08.382 --> 20:11.240
Can I leave this
here, thank you.

20:14.355 --> 20:15.981
- Michael, wait!

20:16.016 --> 20:17.884
Let me step through.

20:17.919 --> 20:19.182
Please, stop.

20:19.217 --> 20:20.249
- I have
to enter the forest!

20:20.284 --> 20:22.361
Enter the trees, I can
be safe in the trees.

20:22.396 --> 20:24.495
I must go to the forest, forest.

20:24.530 --> 20:26.024
I must enter the trees.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.795
Trees can save me!

20:27.830 --> 20:29.027
- Hey, Jeanie.

20:30.866 --> 20:32.063
Please.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.372
- Let me get the fucking knife!

20:33.407 --> 20:34.538
- I got this, okay?

20:35.739 --> 20:37.442
We won't be needing any
of your American guns.

20:37.477 --> 20:39.576
Do not show them,
do you hear me?

20:39.611 --> 20:41.237
- Yeah, anyone could hear you.

20:41.272 --> 20:42.238
- Jeanie.

20:42.273 --> 20:44.680
It's me, Dr. Thomas.

20:44.715 --> 20:46.946
It is all going to be
just fine, do you hear me?

20:46.981 --> 20:49.520
No one died, no one is bad off,

20:49.555 --> 20:51.181
it is all okay.

20:51.216 --> 20:54.393
Am I speaking to Jeanie,
or is it Kimber-Ann Baru?

20:54.428 --> 20:58.221
Or is it Blackhorse?

20:58.256 --> 20:59.794
Oh, I like you music, Jeanie.

20:59.829 --> 21:02.434
You have so much
great taste in music.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.294
For this music has
so much character.

21:05.329 --> 21:07.538
Thank you for playing it for us.

21:07.573 --> 21:12.510
- Do you like this song,
Dr. Thomas?

21:14.107 --> 21:16.778
This human, another human
you bring in my domain!

21:18.452 --> 21:19.616
He's irritating me!

21:22.456 --> 21:25.017
Send him away now!

21:26.757 --> 21:27.525
Doctor!

21:28.924 --> 21:31.122
Send him away!

21:31.157 --> 21:33.861
Will you never learn?

21:33.896 --> 21:36.501
I won't cast myself
near this one.

21:37.966 --> 21:39.295
He's like my father!

21:53.784 --> 21:54.552
- What the hell?

21:54.587 --> 21:55.751
That's not French,
is it Spanish?

21:55.786 --> 21:57.016
What's she saying?

21:57.051 --> 21:58.655
- It's Spanish, she's
speaking Spanish.

21:58.690 --> 22:00.316
She's speaking of her father,

22:00.351 --> 22:02.021
that he enjoyed the blood,
that he liked the blood.

22:02.056 --> 22:04.023
He abused her.

22:04.058 --> 22:06.432
Sunshine, come here.

22:06.467 --> 22:07.697
Come with Dr. Thomas, okay?

22:07.732 --> 22:09.435
I love you, I'm here.

22:10.966 --> 22:12.438
We can go get some
ice cream on the quay

22:12.473 --> 22:13.670
like we did last month.

22:13.705 --> 22:15.771
- You told me she stayed
here all the time!

22:15.806 --> 22:16.772
- It was only 25 minutes.

22:16.807 --> 22:18.675
She was with me all the
time, with Logan and I.

22:18.710 --> 22:19.973
- Where, where did you go?

22:20.008 --> 22:21.447
- I mean Oliver Cromwell and I.

22:21.482 --> 22:22.547
She went to the loo.

22:22.582 --> 22:23.548
- What the hell is a loo?

22:23.583 --> 22:26.111
- A nice word for toilet, sir.

22:26.146 --> 22:27.420
I thought you read a lot.

22:27.455 --> 22:29.312
- They don't teach French
in Rucker's Island.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.490
- She was gone maybe
a minute, maybe 10,

22:31.525 --> 22:33.459
you can't be serious.

22:33.494 --> 22:34.460
- I'm gonna need
the fucking address

22:34.495 --> 22:35.791
of that ice cream shop.

22:35.826 --> 22:37.353
- Just to the right
down that alley.

22:37.388 --> 22:39.157
Sir, I need to calm her down.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.798
When I get her calm, try
talking the knife away from her

22:42.833 --> 22:44.063
so I can give her the shot.

22:44.098 --> 22:45.328
- Yeah, I'll get
the fucking knife.

22:45.363 --> 22:46.230
- She tried
to kiss Jeanie!

22:46.265 --> 22:47.506
- Who tried to kiss Jeanie?

22:47.541 --> 22:50.333
- That fucking slut you
let work on the guy!

22:50.368 --> 22:52.137
She's thicker than any patient.

22:52.172 --> 22:54.205
I begged you to
farm on that one.

23:01.049 --> 23:01.916
- That's not Spanish.

23:01.951 --> 23:03.214
What the fuck is she saying?

23:03.249 --> 23:04.556
That's French or
what, what is that?

23:04.591 --> 23:06.558
How many languages
does she speak?!

23:08.056 --> 23:09.528
- She
speaks nine languages

23:09.563 --> 23:10.892
that I can recollect.

23:10.927 --> 23:12.564
- Many Irish speaks French.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.226
This is Europe, Agent
Pietra, you can't be serious.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.393
Don't tell me you believe
it's another soul's voice.

23:17.428 --> 23:19.230
What kind of detective are you?

23:19.265 --> 23:20.506
- Latin?

23:20.541 --> 23:21.606
When did they teach
Latin in London?

23:21.641 --> 23:22.904
Or old Greek?

23:22.939 --> 23:25.401
She's read an entire
speech in old Arameic.

23:25.436 --> 23:27.007
You're daft, woman.

23:27.042 --> 23:28.745
Your college didn't teach
you any common sense.

23:28.780 --> 23:31.308
We've had this conversation.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.442
She's a second level
college dropout.

23:33.477 --> 23:36.280
She has no understanding
of Latin or Greek.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.447
And for sure no Arameic.

23:38.482 --> 23:40.416
- Blackhorse, stop her.

23:40.451 --> 23:41.791
Please, Blackhorse.

23:41.826 --> 23:42.957
Blackhorse, help Jeanie.

23:42.992 --> 23:44.596
- Jeanie.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.533
God bless the day you
were born, God loves you.

23:47.568 --> 23:49.733
I've forgiven you for
what you've done to me.

23:49.768 --> 23:50.899
Forgive yourself.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.133
Rebuke this demon
in the name of-

23:54.168 --> 23:55.508
- Boyle's mistress.

23:55.543 --> 23:58.335
She's one of my favorite,
Jeanie, put the knife down.

24:01.582 --> 24:03.142
Come, give me the knife.

24:03.177 --> 24:05.375
And let's go play
with Joan of Arc.

24:05.410 --> 24:06.442
Remember how she sat

24:06.477 --> 24:07.245
on your hand?

24:07.280 --> 24:08.015
- Joan of Arc?

24:08.050 --> 24:09.313
- Yes.

24:09.348 --> 24:13.020
- Dr. Thomas, Joan
of Arc loves Freud.

24:14.518 --> 24:15.957
And Freud loves her too.

24:15.992 --> 24:17.563
- Yeah.

24:17.598 --> 24:20.390
- And they love each other
forever, you told me that.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.834
And Freud don't
want to abuse her.

24:24.869 --> 24:27.606
I've seen that.

24:31.876 --> 24:33.546
- Let her be, I got this.

24:33.581 --> 24:35.009
- Got what, Doctor?

24:35.044 --> 24:37.275
Sandra's face already
looks like a zipper.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.178
I already have orders
from the warden.

24:39.213 --> 24:40.685
Put the knife down.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.852
Put the fucking knife down!

24:42.887 --> 24:44.722
Put the knife down, Jeanie.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.661
- Ow, he's raping me!

24:49.696 --> 24:51.025
- Get a shot!

24:51.060 --> 24:52.158
- No, Logan!

24:52.193 --> 24:53.423
No, stop!
- Get her out of here!

24:53.458 --> 24:54.490
- How does she
know my real name?

24:54.525 --> 24:56.701
- I'm sorry Logan, I slipped.

25:02.005 --> 25:03.499
- Good one, doctor.

25:04.744 --> 25:07.844
- Ah, there we go, there's
some beautiful music.

25:07.879 --> 25:09.747
From God on high.

25:12.279 --> 25:14.444
Welcome to Ireland,
Agent Pietra.

25:14.479 --> 25:15.654
- Yeah.

25:15.689 --> 25:16.754
- Agent Pietra!

25:17.757 --> 25:19.218
Nurse Sandra said
to give you these.

25:19.253 --> 25:20.450
It's cold outside.

25:20.485 --> 25:21.352
- Oh no, thank you darling

25:21.387 --> 25:23.354
I'm used to the cold.

25:23.389 --> 25:25.059
- Thank you, I'm not used to it.

25:26.557 --> 25:28.898
I don't know how you get
used to something like this.

25:28.933 --> 25:31.703
- Ah, now that's
music on most high.

25:34.499 --> 25:36.235
Welcome to Ireland,
Agent Pietra.

25:37.601 --> 25:38.908
Care for a smoke?

25:40.208 --> 25:41.372
- A cig?

25:41.407 --> 25:42.648
A priest who smokes?

25:43.915 --> 25:46.113
- You have to around
here with them 'uns.

25:47.281 --> 25:49.314
Oh aren't they a
sight for sore eyes?

25:49.349 --> 25:51.756
Not one of them goes to church.

25:51.791 --> 25:53.582
Oh, Jesus.

25:53.617 --> 25:55.188
There's the matron.

25:55.223 --> 25:57.663
She'll hide me if
she sees me smoking.

25:57.698 --> 25:59.896
- Well I guess I won't
smoke so you're not tempted.

25:59.931 --> 26:01.766
Just for a little while.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.428
You know cigs are bad
for health, they say.

26:04.463 --> 26:07.706
- Everybody says
they believe in God.

26:08.940 --> 26:11.677
But I've yet to meet anyone
who's a great hurry to meet him.

26:15.177 --> 26:17.716
It's good to see
you're a good Catholic,

26:17.751 --> 26:19.311
finally someone to preach to.

26:20.611 --> 26:22.413
None of them go to church.

26:26.188 --> 26:29.761
- Well, it's gonna be a long
day, Father, a long day.

26:29.796 --> 26:30.894
You see, I don't belong

26:30.929 --> 26:33.358
to the Catholic church
anymore, I quit.

26:33.393 --> 26:35.063
I became a Russian Orthodox.

26:35.098 --> 26:36.394
You wanna know why?

26:37.595 --> 26:41.432
I see more Satanists
in Rome that work there

26:41.467 --> 26:42.675
than any strip club.

26:43.634 --> 26:46.745
And the pope, he ain't no pope.

26:46.780 --> 26:48.241
He believes in abortion,
he doesn't believe

26:48.276 --> 26:50.540
in anything about
Vatican, the originals.

26:50.575 --> 26:52.850
What kind of pope, why
even be a Catholic for him?

26:52.885 --> 26:54.379
I'm not saying there's
not good people

26:54.414 --> 26:56.722
in the Catholic church,
I know there is.

26:56.757 --> 26:58.757
- You're darn right
there's good people.

26:58.792 --> 27:00.825
- Yeah, I even go to a
Catholic church in an emergency

27:00.860 --> 27:03.663
'cause I know
there's good people.

27:05.865 --> 27:07.623
- Did your mother
drop you on your head

27:07.658 --> 27:08.932
when you were an infant?

27:11.134 --> 27:12.936
You are a strange cat.

27:12.971 --> 27:15.169
- I got a priest
who smokes, drinks.

27:15.204 --> 27:17.138
You probably don't
even believe in demons.

27:17.173 --> 27:20.009
- I didn't say I don't
believe in demons.

27:20.044 --> 27:22.374
I asked do you believe in 'em.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.048
- Father, let me tell you this.

27:26.083 --> 27:28.721
For 10 years, in LA,

27:30.021 --> 27:31.691
I worked for the
Occult Crime Unit.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.353
I've seen everything there is.

27:34.388 --> 27:36.586
I've seen pentagrams
drawn on the ground,

27:36.621 --> 27:38.258
I've seen sacrifices.

27:38.293 --> 27:39.831
Every dog, every cat,

27:39.866 --> 27:41.866
every kind of animal
you've seen sacrificed.

27:43.067 --> 27:45.661
I've seen priests
and evangelists,

27:45.696 --> 27:48.741
where they kill
with Satanic symbols

27:48.776 --> 27:50.435
drawn all over their body.

27:50.470 --> 27:52.811
I see the woman,
little bitty lady,

27:53.847 --> 27:54.879
she had the power of an ox.

27:54.914 --> 27:56.276
She threw this guy in a ditch,

27:56.311 --> 27:58.916
guys chanting with these
weird forms, right?

28:00.887 --> 28:03.921
I've seen everything
there is in LA.

28:03.956 --> 28:06.825
I've seen every murderer
with every Satanic smile

28:06.860 --> 28:08.992
and the murderous face.

28:09.027 --> 28:12.655
- You avoid the question
like the plague.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.898
- I was getting there.

28:13.933 --> 28:16.296
I was getting there.

28:16.331 --> 28:18.199
I got hired as a
private investigator

28:18.234 --> 28:20.696
to follow this young woman.

28:20.731 --> 28:22.005
She was about 20.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.270
She went to this big
mansion one night.

28:23.305 --> 28:24.909
Her father said they
were getting there

28:24.944 --> 28:26.108
into witchcraft, right?

28:26.704 --> 28:28.077
So I go in there.

28:28.112 --> 28:29.705
And they start off.

28:29.740 --> 28:32.180
They're doing all these weird
dances and this and that,

28:32.215 --> 28:34.050
and they started
doing all these drugs.

28:34.085 --> 28:36.052
Then they started
doing all these orgies.

28:36.087 --> 28:37.713
Then they started
cutting their wrist

28:37.748 --> 28:40.892
and drinking from
their own life force.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.686
And then my position
was compromised.

28:43.721 --> 28:44.753
I had to run down the hill,

28:44.788 --> 28:46.557
I had no weapon, no
contact, no nobody.

28:46.592 --> 28:49.593
And these four men
dragged me into the grove

28:49.628 --> 28:51.903
and they laid me on a slab.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.806
And they carved a
pentagram on my back.

28:53.841 --> 28:56.435
- Jesus, Joseph and Mary!

28:56.470 --> 28:57.876
- And they...

28:57.911 --> 28:59.108
When they cut me here,

28:59.143 --> 29:01.880
see, I got a scar here,
they cut my throat.

29:01.915 --> 29:03.145
- Well you
don't have to continue this.

29:03.180 --> 29:04.949
- No, no, I gotta tell somebody.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.987
It's not what they did to me.

29:11.485 --> 29:12.748
They took this little girl.

29:12.783 --> 29:14.618
This woman put this
little girl on a slab

29:14.653 --> 29:17.896
and this woman, she
came by the slab and

29:17.931 --> 29:19.194
she put another slab down.

29:19.229 --> 29:20.965
It was very small and they...

29:25.103 --> 29:26.839
They took this little girl.

29:28.007 --> 29:30.909
They took this dagger,
came to her body!

29:30.944 --> 29:33.637
- Continue,
continue, God is with you.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.045
I'm here as well.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.079
- Finally...

29:37.577 --> 29:39.247
This helicopter came.

29:39.282 --> 29:42.316
I saw that little boy, I saw
his hair was blonde from behind

29:42.351 --> 29:43.856
but I couldn't see his face.

29:43.891 --> 29:45.319
He was running backwards to me.

29:45.354 --> 29:47.783
It was very strange, like
a dream but it was real.

29:47.818 --> 29:49.323
And the witches, they ran

29:49.358 --> 29:50.929
and said "5-0, 5-0!

29:51.899 --> 29:53.558
No witnesses, no witnesses!"

29:55.199 --> 29:56.594
And then they ran.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.596
They ran to the forest.

29:58.631 --> 30:02.303
They're gonna die, these people,
father, they're gonna die!

30:02.338 --> 30:05.042
- Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the Lord.

30:08.982 --> 30:10.883
- Father, do you think
the little girl's okay?

30:10.918 --> 30:13.182
You think she's in heaven?

30:13.217 --> 30:16.779
- She's smiling, she's
with the creator.

30:16.814 --> 30:18.891
And she is smiling.

30:19.850 --> 30:20.992
She's smiling.

30:22.457 --> 30:24.028
- You think so, huh?

30:27.528 --> 30:28.824
I'm sorry, Father.

30:28.859 --> 30:31.464
I feel like I've been
through a carwash.

30:31.499 --> 30:33.763
- Only a New Yorker
can compliment you

30:33.798 --> 30:35.666
with the back of his hands.

30:36.834 --> 30:39.010
- Don't forget
your music, please.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.605
- Thank you very much, Agent.

30:42.873 --> 30:45.709
- What are you doing,
leaving that for the drunks?

30:45.744 --> 30:46.952
- No.

30:46.987 --> 30:49.845
I need to clean up a bit
for the next few days.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.814
Jeanie's exorcism starts.

30:51.849 --> 30:54.883
But I know the devil
is cleverer than me

30:54.918 --> 30:57.325
and I have to put on
the full armor of God.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.460
And I would suggest
you do the same, Agent.

31:00.495 --> 31:01.967
You're only an observer.

31:03.267 --> 31:05.905
But he's gonna try to drag
you into his dark web.

31:07.898 --> 31:09.799
- Who's gonna drag
me into their web?

31:09.834 --> 31:12.472
- Those demons that
you're on the fence about.

31:12.507 --> 31:14.914
And maybe even
the devil himself.

31:16.610 --> 31:21.481
- Good night, Father.

31:37.565 --> 31:38.333
Hey, kid.

31:39.567 --> 31:40.896
Hey, what are you
doing out here, kid?

31:40.931 --> 31:41.633
Where's your mother?

31:41.668 --> 31:43.041
- I don't have a mother.

31:43.076 --> 31:44.702
- Well where's your father at?

31:44.737 --> 31:46.011
- He's up the hill.

31:46.046 --> 31:47.276
- Well you should get
home to your father.

31:47.311 --> 31:48.574
You shouldn't be out here alone.

31:48.609 --> 31:49.982
- I always do what
my father says.

31:50.017 --> 31:51.544
He says be home at seven.

31:52.382 --> 31:54.580
- All right, you get home.

32:21.807 --> 32:24.808
The hippocampus, what a name.

33:33.615 --> 33:37.122
- Isn't it delightful when a
woman wears nothing underneath?

33:39.159 --> 33:40.488
Do you like that, Sonny?

33:43.790 --> 33:45.020
- Who told you my name?

33:45.858 --> 33:47.330
Who told you my first name?

33:47.365 --> 33:50.597
I wanna know who told
you my first name.

33:50.632 --> 33:53.534
- Knowledge is
power, Agent Pietra.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.075
I know many things.

33:57.540 --> 34:01.773
I know your father enjoyed
all kinds of films.

34:03.777 --> 34:05.942
He tried to kill you
when you were a child.

34:08.221 --> 34:10.551
It must have hurt.

34:10.586 --> 34:11.849
Heroin was his lover.

34:13.556 --> 34:17.261
And your mom, she
enjoy her whiskey.

34:18.330 --> 34:20.990
Do you remember the
smell of her breath?

34:25.766 --> 34:29.966
Irish and Italian,
such a bad, bad temper.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.244
You can't control
yourself, Sonny.

34:34.775 --> 34:37.479
You can't control
your urges either.

34:39.648 --> 34:41.516
Isn't it Oscar Wilde who said

34:42.849 --> 34:46.917
"I can resist anything
but temptation."

34:46.952 --> 34:47.819
Flesh of my flesh.

34:49.328 --> 34:51.196
Bone of my bone.

34:52.397 --> 34:53.792
Lust of my lust.

35:03.133 --> 35:04.902
Stay with me, Sonny.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.002
Stay in hell.

35:07.247 --> 35:09.808
We can live here
together forever.

35:12.351 --> 35:16.320
It's not that bad in
hell as they say it is.

35:16.355 --> 35:17.750
Come on, Sonny.

35:17.785 --> 35:19.114
Stay with me.

37:06.333 --> 37:07.596
- You're late, Logan.

37:07.631 --> 37:09.268
I should have met my
friends at the river.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.067
- You shouldn't have a cigarette
in your mouth, Dolores.

37:17.102 --> 37:18.475
- Why the hell not?

37:22.415 --> 37:23.777
- That's why.

37:23.812 --> 37:25.548
- You know you're the only
one ever to tell me this.

37:25.583 --> 37:27.011
- I'm the only one
to put up with you.

37:27.046 --> 37:28.419
- Can't argue with
you there, you Yank.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.246
Come on, give us
another wee kiss.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.162
- Yeah?

38:19.197 --> 38:21.263
- Agent Pietra.

38:21.298 --> 38:22.638
I'm sorry to bother you

38:22.673 --> 38:24.574
but there's a problem.

38:24.609 --> 38:26.268
- Fr. Malichi.

38:26.303 --> 38:27.676
What's the problem?

38:27.711 --> 38:29.612
- The medical
board just demanded that we

38:29.647 --> 38:34.452
do the exorcism tomorrow or
we won't be able to do it.

38:35.345 --> 38:36.586
- Tomorrow it is.

38:48.325 --> 38:49.995
How you doing, Agent Pietra.

38:50.030 --> 38:52.602
I'm looking for Kennedy,
Captain Kennedy.

38:52.637 --> 38:54.472
- Take a left down
the country road.

38:54.507 --> 38:55.869
That will lead
you to the castle.

38:55.904 --> 38:56.804
- All right.

38:56.839 --> 38:58.135
- Shit, they made a bloody mess.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.477
- Yeah, all
right, let's go see.

38:59.512 --> 39:00.511
Take care.

39:18.762 --> 39:20.025
- Who killed my daddy?

39:20.060 --> 39:20.993
Who killed him?
- I'll call you later.

39:21.028 --> 39:22.357
Don't worry.

39:22.392 --> 39:24.502
I'll call you later.
- No, who killed my daddy?

39:27.705 --> 39:29.001
- Agent Pietra.

39:29.036 --> 39:29.837
Hello, boys.

39:31.368 --> 39:34.479
- Agent Pietra, a job's the
chase as you say New York.

39:34.514 --> 39:36.547
Science boys found nothing.

39:36.582 --> 39:39.011
Detectives found nothing,
police found nothing.

39:39.046 --> 39:40.749
I found nothing.

39:40.784 --> 39:42.179
No leads, no nothing.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.654
Just this body and all
these strange carvings.

39:44.689 --> 39:46.788
- Strange carvings all
over his body, huh?

39:48.451 --> 39:50.352
What do you say you
give me the crime scene

39:50.387 --> 39:52.497
for a little bit on my own, huh?

39:52.532 --> 39:53.388
- It's yours.

39:53.423 --> 39:54.389
We'll leave Ernie along with you

39:54.424 --> 39:56.468
and he can tell us
if you need anything.

39:57.427 --> 39:59.537
Donuts, maybe a
big jug of coffee?

40:00.463 --> 40:02.705
- Agent Pietra,
it's not America.

40:02.740 --> 40:05.400
There's no Spunking
Donuts on every corner.

40:05.435 --> 40:07.237
And no fat lady
serving black tar.

40:07.272 --> 40:08.579
If you need something
from the baker

40:08.614 --> 40:10.207
I'm sure Ernie will get
something there for you.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.945
- Yeah, no worries, no problem.

40:11.980 --> 40:13.375
Anything the Yank,

40:13.410 --> 40:15.718
oh sorry, anything
Agent Pietra needs,

40:15.753 --> 40:17.082
it's no bother, really.

40:18.283 --> 40:19.447
- Agent Pietra, it looks
like you wanna lay off

40:19.482 --> 40:21.020
the pastries anyway.

40:24.289 --> 40:25.695
- Go fuck yourself.

40:25.730 --> 40:27.961
- Look, the Chief, he
doesn't mean any harm.

40:27.996 --> 40:29.424
He's just having a bit of crack.

40:29.459 --> 40:30.502
- What's crack?

40:31.736 --> 40:33.538
- I mean crack, not
like crack cocaine

40:33.573 --> 40:35.298
like you have in
America, no, no, no.

40:35.333 --> 40:38.433
Crack here in Ireland
just means having a laugh.

40:38.468 --> 40:40.809
- You said nothing.

40:40.844 --> 40:42.877
He said he found nothing.

40:42.912 --> 40:45.209
What is this?

40:45.244 --> 40:46.518
And what is this?

40:48.687 --> 40:49.884
You know what that is?

40:49.919 --> 40:51.853
- No, they don't tell
me fucking shite.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.383
They don't seem to
like Interpol agents

40:54.418 --> 40:56.055
being around here either.

40:56.090 --> 40:57.452
Maybe that's why the crack.

40:58.565 --> 41:00.565
They got British
agents here too.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.392
It's a spit in the face,
that's fucking shite.

41:03.427 --> 41:05.460
- Yeah, I'll give him
a crack, all right.

41:07.365 --> 41:08.298
You know what this is?

41:08.333 --> 41:10.102
- That's a mushroom, I presume.

41:10.137 --> 41:11.576
- Magic mushroom.

41:11.611 --> 41:12.940
- Why do they call that magic?

41:12.975 --> 41:15.470
- Satanists use it in
ritualistic sacrifice

41:15.505 --> 41:18.781
and the witches use it
in the ritual sex magic.

41:19.619 --> 41:21.278
- That sounds like a good idea.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.653
- Oh it's not so funny.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.985
- Look, Agent Pietra.

41:26.450 --> 41:29.594
This, this island, it's
thousands of years old, okay?

41:29.629 --> 41:32.993
And all of us here, we
all came from pagans

41:33.028 --> 41:34.291
before Patrick
came on the scene.

41:34.326 --> 41:38.262
So a few mushrooms,
a few chopped up cats

41:38.297 --> 41:39.802
doesn't scare us Irish.

41:39.837 --> 41:42.035
- A few chopped up cats, huh?

41:42.070 --> 41:44.433
How about a few
chopped up grannies?

41:44.468 --> 41:47.304
A few chopped up women,
a few chopped up men?

41:47.339 --> 41:48.536
How about some kids?

41:48.571 --> 41:50.076
- Whoah, whoah,
whoah, whoah, wait.

41:50.914 --> 41:51.847
Take your meds.

41:55.149 --> 41:56.445
Have a swig of this.

42:02.288 --> 42:03.353
Now that's my fault.

42:03.388 --> 42:04.288
I'm sorry.

42:05.995 --> 42:09.634
I should have been more
sensitive to your past, maybe.

42:09.669 --> 42:12.329
- No, it's my fault.

42:13.673 --> 42:16.740
I should have taken my meds
before I left, I'm sorry.

42:16.775 --> 42:17.774
I really am sorry.

42:19.569 --> 42:21.877
How do you know
about my history?

42:21.912 --> 42:23.571
- You're in Ireland, sir.

42:23.606 --> 42:25.980
We love to gossip here.

42:26.015 --> 42:28.114
What the hell else
are we gonna do?

42:28.149 --> 42:29.852
So everybody here knows about

42:30.756 --> 42:32.184
what happened to you in LA.

42:33.286 --> 42:34.054
- I hate LA.

42:35.453 --> 42:37.596
I'm a New Yorker, I
only worked there.

42:39.732 --> 42:40.863
They measured this?

42:42.526 --> 42:43.899
- It's 13 by 13.

42:45.595 --> 42:49.707
- And inside, they have 666

42:49.742 --> 42:52.105
written in blood
on the wall, yeah?

42:52.140 --> 42:55.713
And a man that's
got two pentagrams

42:55.748 --> 42:58.078
carved on each
side of the breast?

42:58.113 --> 43:01.180
- For a cheeky old guy,
you're pretty smart.

43:01.215 --> 43:02.247
- Answer the question.

43:02.282 --> 43:03.754
Were there two pentagrams

43:03.789 --> 43:04.986
carved on each
side of the chest?

43:05.021 --> 43:06.152
- No.

43:06.187 --> 43:07.351
- What do you mean no?

43:07.386 --> 43:09.452
- I mean, they were there, yeah

43:09.487 --> 43:14.259
but there was also
the regular cross

43:14.294 --> 43:15.392
across the stomach.

43:15.427 --> 43:16.294
That's what I mean to say,

43:16.329 --> 43:18.637
it was just kind of unusual.

43:19.838 --> 43:22.135
- The blood was drained
from the body, right?

43:22.170 --> 43:23.433
- Yes sir.

43:23.468 --> 43:27.778
- You have an eternity
tattoo on your neck.

43:27.813 --> 43:30.407
- Oh yeah, you know
young stuff, pagan stuff.

43:30.442 --> 43:32.882
But I wasn't into any
of this crazy stuff,

43:32.917 --> 43:34.752
I mean come on, sir.

43:34.787 --> 43:36.754
- Were there any
more needles found?

43:36.789 --> 43:38.052
- Yeah, yeah,
I mean there's lots

43:38.087 --> 43:39.581
of paraphernalia and,

43:40.925 --> 43:41.649
this.

43:41.684 --> 43:42.727
- Lidocaine.

43:42.762 --> 43:43.519
- Dead on, sir.

43:44.687 --> 43:47.556
- They use that
to numb the victim

43:48.867 --> 43:53.331
and then they take this and
they tie it around their neck.

43:53.366 --> 43:54.299
They squeeze.

43:55.808 --> 43:58.336
And then they
carve up the victim

43:58.371 --> 44:00.008
in a ritualistic fashion.

44:00.043 --> 44:01.713
- What ritual, sir?

44:01.748 --> 44:05.849
- Well just your everyday type
of satanic ritual, you know.

44:05.884 --> 44:08.643
I thought you knew about
your old religion here,

44:08.678 --> 44:10.117
your old country here.

44:10.152 --> 44:12.614
I guess they wipe all the
history clean here too huh

44:12.649 --> 44:14.451
like they do everywhere else.

44:14.486 --> 44:17.861
And the man, he's
carved from the left ear

44:17.896 --> 44:19.731
to the right ear,
right down to the neck?

44:19.766 --> 44:21.524
- I guess
you were there.

44:21.559 --> 44:22.833
- That's real funny.

44:22.868 --> 44:24.659
- You think this is
actually witchcraft?

44:24.694 --> 44:27.662
I mean, I know that's what
you've been brought here

44:27.697 --> 44:29.532
to find out, but

44:29.567 --> 44:32.744
Agent Pietra, Satanic
panic went away in the 90s.

44:32.779 --> 44:33.569
- Oh yeah?

44:36.882 --> 44:37.716
Well it's back.

44:43.746 --> 44:44.855
- Is that it?

44:45.891 --> 44:46.681
We done?

44:47.827 --> 44:48.793
Where are you going?

44:50.093 --> 44:51.554
- I'm late for an exorcism.

44:56.726 --> 44:57.868
- That guy's crackers.

45:20.783 --> 45:23.322
- First it's snowing,
then it's raining,

45:23.357 --> 45:25.093
then it's just cold as fuck.

45:26.932 --> 45:28.063
Hey, you're late for work!

45:30.837 --> 45:31.803
I guess it's that time.

45:54.993 --> 45:58.830
- Arianna, please take
these jackets for us.

45:59.789 --> 46:01.899
It's gonna be hot
there, you see?

46:01.934 --> 46:02.834
- Thank you, Arianna.

46:02.869 --> 46:03.967
- Make sure you
don't go in that room

46:04.002 --> 46:04.935
for an hour at least.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.465
- I won't be going in
there, that's for sure.

46:09.370 --> 46:10.633
- What is that music?

46:10.668 --> 46:13.801
Is this a concert
or an exorcism?

46:13.836 --> 46:15.077
- Well, you know, the only thing

46:15.112 --> 46:16.408
that the doctor and
the priest agree on

46:16.443 --> 46:19.015
is the music, Mozart.

46:19.050 --> 46:21.820
- I mean, classical
music during an exorcism?

46:22.812 --> 46:23.778
This is crazy.

46:23.813 --> 46:24.647
- Fucking nuts, ain't it?

46:26.651 --> 46:29.993
- Hold her down, hold her down1

46:30.028 --> 46:31.192
Hold her harder!

46:32.426 --> 46:35.867
- You cannot
contain an old soul!

46:38.531 --> 46:42.137
- You didn't tie
down her fucking feet?

46:42.172 --> 46:44.271
- Don't curse, it'll
weaken our position.

46:45.505 --> 46:46.372
Pull it up!

46:48.739 --> 46:49.540
- Nurse?

46:50.510 --> 46:51.839
Nurse.

46:53.843 --> 46:56.987
- Take him to the doctors.
- You don't have room for it.

46:57.022 --> 46:58.582
You motherfucker!

46:58.617 --> 47:00.518
You have no courage.

47:00.553 --> 47:02.487
You are a traitor!

47:02.522 --> 47:06.194
A traitor to your
father, to your mother,

47:06.229 --> 47:08.064
to your entire city!

47:08.968 --> 47:12.167
I built the city, motherfucker!

47:12.202 --> 47:14.697
In six days, I build it better!

47:14.732 --> 47:17.139
And I created
every soul in here!

47:17.174 --> 47:20.373
- I command you to
stop harming Jeanie.

47:20.408 --> 47:22.914
In the name of Jesus
Christ our lord!

47:32.057 --> 47:34.651
- What did she say,
Malichi, what did she say?

47:34.686 --> 47:37.555
- You know what, you
took your murders here.

47:37.590 --> 47:42.593
She's speaking of war slogans
and war cries and so on.

47:44.036 --> 47:46.894
- Patient eschews remaining
sense of excitement,

47:46.929 --> 47:49.732
certainly to move to bold
personality for safety net.

48:22.074 --> 48:24.041
- Agent Pietra!

48:24.076 --> 48:25.141
Agent Pietra!

48:26.111 --> 48:26.901
Sonny!

48:28.113 --> 48:29.981
- She said Sonny, she
knows my birth name.

48:30.016 --> 48:31.675
How the hell does she
know my first name?

48:31.710 --> 48:33.083
- Come on, Agent Pietra.

48:33.118 --> 48:35.085
She could have heard that
on any number of occasions

48:35.120 --> 48:36.878
from one of us, or...

48:36.913 --> 48:38.880
- Bullshit, that's bullshit!

48:38.915 --> 48:41.256
How the hell did she
know this, Father?

48:41.291 --> 48:42.950
- Get a hold of yourself, Sonny.

48:42.985 --> 48:46.129
You know the rules
of the exorcism.

48:46.164 --> 48:47.955
- Can I call you Sonny?

48:47.990 --> 48:50.397
- She let the cat out
of the bag, why not?

48:50.432 --> 48:52.003
- Can you just take
this as a simple,

48:52.038 --> 48:55.138
well not so simple
but a case of DID?

48:55.173 --> 48:57.371
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

48:57.406 --> 49:00.143
I'm sure, you in the years
of work in your field

49:00.178 --> 49:02.970
are familiar with
this mental illness.

49:03.005 --> 49:04.279
- I know what DID is.

49:04.314 --> 49:06.611
Yes, I've seen that and
I've seen schizophrenia.

49:06.646 --> 49:07.909
And I've seen a whole
lot more things.

49:07.944 --> 49:10.087
But I've never seen a
woman who's not educated

49:10.122 --> 49:11.583
speak all these languages.

49:11.618 --> 49:14.091
And you think it's just
a brain phenomenon?

49:14.126 --> 49:16.885
- Do you know how-
- You, Doctor!

49:16.920 --> 49:19.987
You're always thinking
about yourself!

49:20.022 --> 49:21.461
- That ain't no DID.

49:21.496 --> 49:23.298
That is some monster mad shit.

49:23.333 --> 49:25.300
- Logan, calm yourself!

49:25.335 --> 49:26.961
Do your job!

49:34.971 --> 49:38.973
- This is absolutely unnecessary
and only hurting her.

49:39.008 --> 49:41.151
You defy logic, all of you.

49:41.186 --> 49:44.583
Come on, exorcims
in this day and age?

49:44.618 --> 49:46.981
You must just be
crazy, all of you.

49:47.016 --> 49:49.093
- This is legal, doctor.

49:49.128 --> 49:51.326
We have a writ from the court.

49:51.361 --> 49:53.955
And I suggest you abide by it

49:53.990 --> 49:55.330
and let us continue.

49:58.962 --> 50:00.995
- Frontal cortex has shrunk.

50:01.030 --> 50:03.173
We have proof, we have
the brain activity.

50:03.208 --> 50:04.834
- How does a shrunken brain

50:04.869 --> 50:06.671
explain the strength of an ox?

50:11.040 --> 50:13.007
- What is this?

50:13.042 --> 50:14.877
- Zendiatha

50:14.912 --> 50:18.815
Taught of enchantments
and the cutting of ropes!

50:20.082 --> 50:23.952
Hathathel taught men how
to make swords and knives

50:23.987 --> 50:26.988
and shields and breastplates.

50:27.023 --> 50:29.397
How to make mirrors
and the worshiping

50:30.928 --> 50:33.269
of ornaments and bracelets.

50:34.404 --> 50:37.064
Armed bracelets and ornaments

50:37.099 --> 50:39.704
and cutting of ropes and effigy.

50:43.215 --> 50:46.315
Amathera, the beauty
of April making.

50:46.350 --> 50:48.515
Verkayal, the
observers of the stars.

50:50.453 --> 50:54.257
Concavel, science of
the constellations.

50:54.292 --> 50:57.293
Effegial, knowledge
of the clouds.

50:58.725 --> 51:02.100
Arachiel, the
signs of the earth.

51:03.235 --> 51:06.236
Zvashiel, signs of the sun.

51:06.271 --> 51:07.105
Stariel, the moon.

51:09.736 --> 51:13.067
Hakiabel, signs, the signs.

51:14.070 --> 51:15.278
Tamia, astronomy.

51:17.007 --> 51:17.808
Hakastega.

51:19.009 --> 51:21.416
You should know
that one, Doctor.

51:23.145 --> 51:27.191
He's been with you with all
your signs and mistakes.

51:27.226 --> 51:29.259
Taught the children of men

51:29.294 --> 51:33.329
and the wicked smiting
of spirits and demons.

51:33.364 --> 51:37.300
And this mighty
astronomy in the womb,

51:37.335 --> 51:39.797
that it might pass away.

51:39.832 --> 51:42.899
- Malichi, I've heard
those chants before

51:42.934 --> 51:44.131
in LA undercover.

51:44.166 --> 51:45.242
What is she saying?

51:45.277 --> 51:49.246
- Fascinating, she's
naming the fallen angels

51:49.281 --> 51:50.313
and their tasks.

51:50.348 --> 51:53.140
- My mother read me
the bible as a kid.

51:53.175 --> 51:55.186
I never heard of
any of those names.

51:55.221 --> 51:57.287
- That's because the
church took them out

51:57.322 --> 51:59.454
to the council of Nicea.

51:59.489 --> 52:01.291
- Gabriel taught
the weapons of war!

52:04.527 --> 52:07.990
- I command you to
let her go in the name

52:08.025 --> 52:10.828
of Jesus of Nazareth!

52:10.863 --> 52:13.765
- Agent Pietra,
according to DSN,

52:13.800 --> 52:15.998
she fits perfect
criteria with DID.

52:16.033 --> 52:19.672
- How the hell does DID cause
such horrendous behavior?

52:19.707 --> 52:22.741
How does she obtain such
intricate knowledge like this,

52:22.776 --> 52:24.842
intricate spiritual knowledge?

52:24.877 --> 52:26.140
- Come on, Sonny.

52:26.175 --> 52:29.253
Usually it's severe childhood
trauma, physical abuse,

52:29.288 --> 52:31.354
sexual abuse cause this.

52:31.389 --> 52:32.619
When the brain splits,

52:32.654 --> 52:35.589
sometimes it can
cause induced genius

52:35.624 --> 52:38.493
or sometimes even
savant syndrome.

52:38.528 --> 52:40.594
- Savant syndrome,
it's a rare condition

52:40.629 --> 52:43.564
which someone has significant
mental disabilities

52:43.599 --> 52:46.336
but he demonstrates
certain abilities

52:46.371 --> 52:47.931
far in the excess
of the average.

52:47.966 --> 52:49.163
I know all about this.

52:49.198 --> 52:52.837
Memory, art, mathematics.

52:52.872 --> 52:55.741
- Can't you see that
she's a bit like you.

52:55.776 --> 52:58.249
She's troubled but very
witty, shall we say?

52:59.208 --> 53:02.110
In your case, a way
to survive prison

53:02.145 --> 53:05.014
'cause you do over desire
and thirst for knowledge.

53:05.049 --> 53:09.326
In Jeanie's case, language
and many talents appear.

53:09.361 --> 53:13.495
And extreme neglect
and molestation
causes hypersexuality.

53:13.530 --> 53:14.826
- Motherfucker!

53:15.664 --> 53:17.367
- That ain't sexy.

53:19.261 --> 53:20.667
- I can tell you Agent Pietra

53:20.702 --> 53:22.768
what happens in Jeanie's brain.

53:22.803 --> 53:24.341
That is where this mystery lies.

53:24.376 --> 53:28.675
The MRIs both functional and
structural MRIs observed.

53:28.710 --> 53:30.677
Most of female DID patients

53:30.712 --> 53:33.383
have reduced the hippocampus
region of the brain

53:33.418 --> 53:35.781
and the amygdala
region of the brain.

53:35.816 --> 53:39.917
31.6 reduction in the
middle region of the brain

53:39.952 --> 53:42.920
and 19.2 percent reduction

53:42.955 --> 53:45.659
in the hippocampus
region of the brain.

53:45.694 --> 53:47.397
The hippocampus
region of the brain

53:47.432 --> 53:50.191
is associated with
long term memory.

53:50.226 --> 53:53.568
- I know the studies
you're quoting, Doctor.

53:53.603 --> 53:57.572
There are only a sample
taken from 15 patients

53:57.607 --> 54:01.070
who are already on
meds from day one.

54:01.105 --> 54:03.204
And even I know
as a lowly priest

54:04.482 --> 54:08.385
that certain drugs reduce
th size in the amygdala

54:08.420 --> 54:11.388
and the hippocampus
in the brain.

54:11.423 --> 54:13.819
There goes your study.

54:13.854 --> 54:15.788
- Two stars in the chest!

54:15.823 --> 54:16.921
Agent Pietra.

54:18.122 --> 54:20.760
There is a gift for
you at the castle.

54:20.795 --> 54:22.432
Look in the water.

54:22.467 --> 54:23.763
- It's as if she was
at the murder scene,

54:23.798 --> 54:25.369
but she's been here all day.

54:25.404 --> 54:27.437
Did you take her out
for more ice cream?

54:27.472 --> 54:29.307
- No, you're
bordering on paranoia.

54:30.838 --> 54:33.300
- Doctor, request all French
be translated to English.

54:33.335 --> 54:35.269
All languages
translate in English.

54:35.304 --> 54:37.106
That's an official order.

54:37.141 --> 54:38.272
- Understood.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.362
- She says, translation,

54:51.397 --> 54:54.464
"Priest, the house can stand
divided against his turf.

54:54.499 --> 54:57.027
Get these two ugly
motherfuckers in line."

54:57.062 --> 55:00.470
- I kill you all, motherfucker!

55:00.505 --> 55:04.672
- Leave for now, I
command you leave Jeanie

55:04.707 --> 55:06.674
in the name of
Jesus of Nazareth!

55:08.040 --> 55:11.140
- Jeanie, calm down, please.

55:11.175 --> 55:12.515
I'm here for you.

55:12.550 --> 55:15.342
Oliver's here for you but
I need you to calm down.

55:15.377 --> 55:18.653
- Now I don't know if she was
connected to these murders

55:18.688 --> 55:22.019
but someone around
her or her family is.

55:22.054 --> 55:24.428
♪ I'm just a little girl ♪

55:24.463 --> 55:28.828
♪ Looking for a big bad wolf ♪

55:28.863 --> 55:30.357
- Father, I need you
to get some information

55:30.392 --> 55:32.535
about the murders from her.

55:32.570 --> 55:34.900
I need you to ask
her some questions.

55:38.543 --> 55:43.546
- The priest has the power
of the earth!

55:47.519 --> 55:50.311
Come away from us!

55:50.346 --> 55:52.819
Come away from
this precious child

55:52.854 --> 55:54.854
in the name of the Lord.

56:02.424 --> 56:04.534
- What the hell do
you think that was?

56:04.569 --> 56:06.030
Is that science?

56:06.065 --> 56:07.570
- Many studies.

56:07.605 --> 56:09.935
Many studies in
Eastern religion,

56:09.970 --> 56:13.543
many yogis in India has shown
this obvious mental state.

56:13.578 --> 56:14.907
- You're crazier than she is.

56:14.942 --> 56:18.240
- Don't you feel the
presence of evil?

56:18.275 --> 56:21.749
Come out of here in the
name of Jesus Christ,

56:21.784 --> 56:23.619
our Savior and Lord.

56:24.754 --> 56:26.050
- The amygdala
region of the brain

56:26.085 --> 56:28.558
is associated with emotions.

56:28.593 --> 56:32.221
That explains why DID
patients forget what they say,

56:32.256 --> 56:35.499
at one personality
and have amnesia.

56:35.534 --> 56:36.434
- Stop him!

56:37.800 --> 56:40.031
Stop him, stop him!

56:40.066 --> 56:42.264
Stop him, he's stopping a war!

56:43.509 --> 56:46.433
- She was looking at
you, Agent Pietra.

56:46.468 --> 56:48.578
There's something
she doesn't like,

56:48.613 --> 56:50.844
something inside you.

56:50.879 --> 56:51.779
- The only thing she's afraid of

56:51.814 --> 56:53.407
is my nine millimeter.

56:53.442 --> 56:56.751
And if it was just physical,
I'd shoot it at her head!

56:56.786 --> 56:59.787
- The spirit contact has
something against you!

56:59.822 --> 57:02.053
- Doctor, help me, help me!

57:02.088 --> 57:02.856
They're hurting me!

57:03.892 --> 57:06.794
Eight, eternity!

57:06.829 --> 57:08.092
Doctor, Doctor!

57:10.426 --> 57:12.932
- In the name of our Lord Jesus,

57:12.967 --> 57:14.736
I curse this devil to go.

57:16.069 --> 57:17.332
- Get him away!

57:18.170 --> 57:19.466
Get him away!

57:19.501 --> 57:21.072
He's a killer!

57:21.107 --> 57:24.680
He's a killer, he's a
murderer, he's killing me.

57:24.715 --> 57:26.979
- Here Agent Pietra,
take the cross.

57:27.014 --> 57:29.586
Hold it above her, do it now!

57:30.413 --> 57:31.346
- I can't do this.

57:31.381 --> 57:32.754
I wanna get out of here!

57:32.789 --> 57:34.481
You know what
happened to me before?

57:34.516 --> 57:36.450
I can't take this!

57:36.485 --> 57:38.595
- Come on, Agent Pietra.

57:38.630 --> 57:41.125
- I've sinned more than
a pack of bikers, man.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.929
I'm the wrong guy for this!

57:42.964 --> 57:45.129
- We have to get
rid of this devil.

57:45.164 --> 57:47.769
You have to do this,
Pietra, please.

57:47.804 --> 57:49.672
It couldn't hurt.

57:49.707 --> 57:50.673
You have to do this.

57:50.708 --> 57:52.807
- Her cortex is her issues.

57:52.842 --> 57:55.337
This poor woman needs rest.

57:55.372 --> 57:58.978
You know, she's not
responsible for what she does

57:59.013 --> 58:01.849
anymore than a blind
person for not seeing.

58:01.884 --> 58:04.654
- Please, good sir, help her!

58:04.689 --> 58:07.690
Say something, say anything
that you can remember

58:07.725 --> 58:09.516
from Catholic school!

58:09.551 --> 58:10.957
Say it, say it now!

58:10.992 --> 58:12.761
- But I'm the lifer!

58:12.796 --> 58:13.993
- This is ridiculous.

58:14.028 --> 58:15.830
I'm ending this now.

58:15.865 --> 58:19.163
- Now, do it, while
we have a chance!

58:19.198 --> 58:21.165
Continue, Sonny!

58:21.200 --> 58:23.101
- You can do it, Sonny.

58:23.136 --> 58:25.268
- This insanity ends now.

58:25.303 --> 58:29.107
- Who am I fighting,
you or the devil?

58:29.142 --> 58:30.537
- I'm going to stop this now.

58:30.572 --> 58:32.682
- Say it, say it now!

58:38.250 --> 58:41.383
- Our father, who art in heaven,

58:41.418 --> 58:43.517
hallowed be thy name.

58:43.552 --> 58:45.288
- Thy kingdom come,

58:45.323 --> 58:46.960
- Thy will be done

58:46.995 --> 58:50.359
on earth as it is in heaven.

58:50.394 --> 58:53.230
Give us this day
our daily bread.

58:53.265 --> 58:55.463
Forgive us our trespasses

58:55.498 --> 58:59.005
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.403
Lead us not into temptation

59:01.438 --> 59:03.075
but deliver us from evil.

59:03.110 --> 59:06.078
For thine is the
kingdom, the power

59:06.113 --> 59:07.310
and the glory!

59:08.412 --> 59:09.686
Forever and ever.

59:11.756 --> 59:12.953
- Amen.
- Amen.

59:21.623 --> 59:22.798
She's sleeping.

59:36.308 --> 59:38.572
- Let me know if you
need anything else, doctor.

59:38.607 --> 59:40.145
- We're
fine, thank you.

59:43.381 --> 59:44.754
- Have a wee swig of this,

59:44.789 --> 59:46.250
this'll set you right.

59:48.650 --> 59:51.486
You did good, man, you did good.

59:56.493 --> 59:58.867
You drunk it all, you git!

59:58.902 --> 1:00:01.067
- It's not everyday
you do an exorcism.

1:00:01.102 --> 1:00:01.903
- Luckily,

1:00:05.139 --> 1:00:05.940
there's more.

1:00:06.811 --> 1:00:08.074
Get your own.

1:00:08.109 --> 1:00:11.539
- All right.

1:00:11.574 --> 1:00:12.749
- She'll be all right.

1:00:12.784 --> 1:00:14.949
They're gone, they're all gone.

1:00:14.984 --> 1:00:16.280
- Who's gone?

1:00:16.315 --> 1:00:18.612
You must be joking, Fr. Malichi.

1:00:18.647 --> 1:00:20.856
You know exactly
what happened there.

1:00:20.891 --> 1:00:23.320
It was integration.

1:00:23.355 --> 1:00:24.761
- Integration?

1:00:24.796 --> 1:00:26.994
What in the hell is integration?

1:00:27.029 --> 1:00:28.622
- The coordination process of

1:00:28.657 --> 1:00:31.295
dissociative identity
disorder sufferers.

1:00:31.330 --> 1:00:34.661
It was simply the breakdown
of fusing processes

1:00:34.696 --> 1:00:36.135
you need to become alters

1:00:36.170 --> 1:00:37.807
in damnation, in Jeanie.

1:00:38.777 --> 1:00:40.777
- Doctor, I think
you need this drink

1:00:40.812 --> 1:00:42.570
more than the rest of us.

1:00:42.605 --> 1:00:45.144
After what you witnessed
in there tonight,

1:00:45.179 --> 1:00:47.949
you're gonna call it
some sort of fusion?

1:00:47.984 --> 1:00:50.149
I'm sorry, Agent Pietra.

1:00:51.053 --> 1:00:52.690
I hate scoffers.

1:00:56.058 --> 1:00:57.057
Good night, Doctor.

1:01:00.161 --> 1:01:04.493
And you, you saved that girl
tonight through bravery.

1:01:04.528 --> 1:01:08.662
I think you may have found
something in yourself as well.

1:01:08.697 --> 1:01:10.202
Good man, you.

1:01:10.237 --> 1:01:11.533
- Thank you.

1:01:11.568 --> 1:01:12.699
- Keep
up the good fight.

1:01:12.734 --> 1:01:14.338
- Good night, sir.

1:01:15.737 --> 1:01:18.705
- Some cause happiness
wherever they go

1:01:18.740 --> 1:01:20.916
and others, whenever they go.

1:01:21.886 --> 1:01:24.447
- I think I started a mad trend.

1:01:24.482 --> 1:01:27.549
Now you're quoting Oscar Wilde.

1:01:27.584 --> 1:01:29.617
I thought you liked the Father.

1:01:29.652 --> 1:01:31.619
- I think he hurt her
more than help her.

1:01:31.654 --> 1:01:34.688
I'll have to spend all day
with her in therapy tomorrow.

1:01:34.723 --> 1:01:36.360
She was doing so well,

1:01:36.395 --> 1:01:38.461
she's been integrating all week.

1:01:39.629 --> 1:01:41.068
Oh.

1:01:41.103 --> 1:01:42.036
- I think...

1:01:44.975 --> 1:01:47.976
I'm gonna have to disagree
with you on that one.

1:01:50.475 --> 1:01:51.705
Doctor.

1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:52.915
- Uh huh?

1:01:52.950 --> 1:01:55.885
- Can I see what's
under your right sleeve?

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:58.415
- Come on, Agent Pietra.

1:01:58.450 --> 1:02:01.286
PTSD is not an excuse
for sexual harassment.

1:02:02.553 --> 1:02:04.124
- Nothing of the sort.

1:02:04.159 --> 1:02:07.523
I saw a tattoo underneath
your right sleeve.

1:02:07.558 --> 1:02:09.030
I'd like to see
it again, please.

1:02:09.065 --> 1:02:10.427
- Mhmm.

1:02:13.465 --> 1:02:15.234
- The eternity symbol.

1:02:15.269 --> 1:02:17.874
I've seen that
before in my work.

1:02:17.909 --> 1:02:19.535
- Come on, Sonny, you
have been traumatized

1:02:19.570 --> 1:02:20.811
with the priest.

1:02:20.846 --> 1:02:22.912
Have you locked your
rotating door tonight?

1:02:22.947 --> 1:02:24.606
You need a good night of sleep

1:02:24.641 --> 1:02:26.608
and a couple of valium.

1:02:26.643 --> 1:02:28.775
- But I don't leave
any stone unturned.

1:02:28.810 --> 1:02:31.822
- Might have to lock you
up here for a few days

1:02:31.857 --> 1:02:32.988
and get some tests on you.

1:02:34.156 --> 1:02:35.892
I mean, that is
like the two degrees

1:02:35.927 --> 1:02:38.719
that I received in the college.

1:02:38.754 --> 1:02:40.963
Eternal friends,
friends for life.

1:02:40.998 --> 1:02:43.966
Do you think the whole world
is Satanic, Agent Pietra?

1:02:45.464 --> 1:02:48.234
- I don't
know, I don't know.

1:02:48.269 --> 1:02:51.941
- Are you off to get drunk
with the hypocrite priest?

1:02:51.976 --> 1:02:52.876
- No.

1:02:52.911 --> 1:02:54.845
I'm going to the castle lake.

1:02:56.145 --> 1:02:59.949
- Come on, the place one of
Jeanie's outbursts mentioned?

1:03:00.886 --> 1:03:02.248
Come on, Agent Pietra.

1:03:02.283 --> 1:03:05.119
She was in a state of psychosis.

1:03:05.154 --> 1:03:07.781
She also said that
you were a murderer.

1:03:07.816 --> 1:03:09.783
Come on man, get
yourself together.

1:03:09.818 --> 1:03:12.863
The whole town is up
in arms over this.

1:03:14.196 --> 1:03:16.790
Children afraid to
walk the streets.

1:03:16.825 --> 1:03:18.297
- There were no
kids that were hurt

1:03:18.332 --> 1:03:19.331
in any of these murders.

1:03:19.366 --> 1:03:20.332
Good night, Doctor.

1:03:31.510 --> 1:03:33.114
- Agent Hastings.

1:03:33.149 --> 1:03:34.775
I have some complicated

1:03:34.810 --> 1:03:38.515
but very relevant information
for you about Agent Pietra.

1:03:39.716 --> 1:03:41.287
He is in on it.

1:03:41.322 --> 1:03:42.849
- In on what, Ma'am?

1:03:42.884 --> 1:03:44.851
- He murdered them all.

1:03:44.886 --> 1:03:47.854
We believe he is
responsible for both murders

1:03:47.889 --> 1:03:49.394
and a lot more besides that.

1:03:51.002 --> 1:03:52.661
- Listen, are we
on a clear line?

1:03:52.696 --> 1:03:54.366
No, you imbecile.

1:03:54.401 --> 1:03:56.368
Am I six years old?

1:03:56.403 --> 1:03:59.371
We've been on to Agent
Pietra for weeks now.

1:03:59.406 --> 1:04:02.341
We did not inform you as it
was a need to know basis.

1:04:02.376 --> 1:04:03.980
- That sly son of a bitch.

1:04:04.015 --> 1:04:05.212
He must have lost it

1:04:05.247 --> 1:04:07.874
tracking down all
those devil worshipers.

1:04:07.909 --> 1:04:09.876
- We set him up a few months ago

1:04:09.911 --> 1:04:12.186
due to the murder of
three high priests

1:04:12.221 --> 1:04:14.518
from the Bohemian Grove Lodge.

1:04:14.553 --> 1:04:17.818
A witness spotted Agent
Pietra at the grove.

1:04:17.853 --> 1:04:19.358
He was wearing a jogging suit

1:04:19.393 --> 1:04:20.821
and a long black wig.

1:04:20.856 --> 1:04:24.231
He followed him and
tracked his footsteps.

1:04:24.266 --> 1:04:26.002
So the footprints matched.

1:04:26.037 --> 1:04:28.499
Then we had a special
agent in Dublin,

1:04:28.534 --> 1:04:29.940
gave him a massage.

1:04:29.975 --> 1:04:32.833
Got a hair follicle
and it matched.

1:04:32.868 --> 1:04:37.178
Agent Pietra is
killing the witches.

1:04:37.213 --> 1:04:41.050
Hastings, you know if he
exposes certain things

1:04:41.085 --> 1:04:43.052
about certain people,

1:04:43.087 --> 1:04:45.714
you know it won't be
good for any of us.

1:05:37.999 --> 1:05:39.240
- You bastard.

1:05:40.309 --> 1:05:42.078
You never entered on the ferry.

1:05:42.113 --> 1:05:44.542
You only picked up the car,

1:05:44.577 --> 1:05:46.313
came in from France to Dublin.

1:05:46.348 --> 1:05:48.843
And he's as slick
as a seal's ass.

1:06:00.593 --> 1:06:02.758
Yes, good evening, Dr. Thomas.

1:06:02.793 --> 1:06:04.793
Yes, it's Agent Hastings here.

1:06:06.170 --> 1:06:07.301
Do you have a few moments?

1:06:52.513 --> 1:06:54.007
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

1:06:54.042 --> 1:06:55.052
I'm so sorry.

1:06:57.221 --> 1:06:58.913
You will be avenged.

1:06:58.948 --> 1:06:59.749
You will be.

1:07:01.225 --> 1:07:03.555
I promise you,
you'll be avenged.

1:07:05.053 --> 1:07:05.821
You'll be

1:07:05.856 --> 1:07:08.098
Ugh!

1:07:13.061 --> 1:07:15.028
- You ignorant son of a bitch!

1:07:15.063 --> 1:07:17.173
You got her killed!

1:07:17.208 --> 1:07:19.373
We had to sacrifice someone!

1:07:19.408 --> 1:07:21.342
You killed our high priest!

1:07:21.377 --> 1:07:22.376
This is you!

1:07:23.577 --> 1:07:26.380
Tonight you're doing
the walk of death.

1:07:26.415 --> 1:07:28.976
- I'll kill all of
you, you witches.

1:07:29.011 --> 1:07:30.714
I've killed hundreds!

1:07:30.749 --> 1:07:32.012
I'll kill you all!

1:07:32.047 --> 1:07:34.190
- You killed our
greatest ritual master

1:07:34.225 --> 1:07:35.488
and our high priest!

1:07:35.523 --> 1:07:38.359
Tonight, you will
die a horrible death.

1:07:38.394 --> 1:07:40.922
- And there's more than me.

1:07:40.957 --> 1:07:42.055
You can kill me.

1:07:42.959 --> 1:07:44.992
But many will follow me.

1:07:45.027 --> 1:07:47.236
We're all sick of
your child murders!

1:07:47.271 --> 1:07:50.096
You pagans will be wiped
off the face of the earth!

1:07:50.131 --> 1:07:52.032
- We're on our way
to see your friend

1:07:52.067 --> 1:07:53.869
Looney Bin Logan O'Bern.

1:07:53.904 --> 1:07:55.772
Just remember this
once the life is ebbing

1:07:55.807 --> 1:07:57.477
out of you in this lake.

1:07:57.512 --> 1:08:00.513
You're responsible for
young lover's death.

1:08:00.548 --> 1:08:02.812
Like Romeo and Juliet!

1:08:02.847 --> 1:08:05.045
Like poetry, you motherfucker!

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:08.719
Tonight is Romeo and
Juliet, you Christian puke!

1:08:08.754 --> 1:08:11.227
You're responsible for
young lover's death.

1:08:11.262 --> 1:08:12.921
She's one of ours.

1:08:12.956 --> 1:08:15.055
We all love Dr. Thomas.

1:08:15.090 --> 1:08:17.464
We've all made
love to Dr. Thomas.

1:08:17.499 --> 1:08:21.270
You're the only one that
doesn't get that, dollface.

1:08:21.305 --> 1:08:23.096
Like Shakespeare.

1:08:34.351 --> 1:08:35.647
You motherfucker!

1:08:35.682 --> 1:08:37.484
Put him in the lake!

1:08:37.519 --> 1:08:38.980
- I will call my father!

1:08:42.150 --> 1:08:43.523
- What the hell?

1:08:43.558 --> 1:08:45.591
- Go now, I'm recording you.

1:08:45.626 --> 1:08:47.395
If you don't leave
now, I'll press send

1:08:47.430 --> 1:08:48.363
and the whole city will get

1:08:48.398 --> 1:08:49.463
this video.
- Let go.

1:08:49.498 --> 1:08:50.761
He doesn't know who we are.

1:08:50.796 --> 1:08:51.531
We'll get the Chief in there,

1:08:51.566 --> 1:08:53.368
he's one of my people.

1:08:57.539 --> 1:08:59.099
- Who are you?

1:08:59.134 --> 1:09:00.166
What are you doing here?

1:09:00.201 --> 1:09:02.245
Get out of here
before they come back!

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:04.610
- Always worried about
others, Agent Pietra.

1:09:04.645 --> 1:09:06.777
Time you worry about yourself.

1:09:06.812 --> 1:09:09.109
Look towards the
most high, Pietra.

1:09:09.144 --> 1:09:10.649
Look towards the heavens.

1:09:20.298 --> 1:09:21.154
- Come with me!

1:09:21.189 --> 1:09:23.662
We can take them all down, come!

1:09:23.697 --> 1:09:25.301
- My father has not approved.

1:09:25.336 --> 1:09:26.698
The mystery will be revealed.

1:09:26.733 --> 1:09:28.370
Go now, Agent Pietra.

1:09:28.405 --> 1:09:30.031
They know you
killed the witches.

1:09:30.066 --> 1:09:31.934
Go now and save the Adam man.

1:09:31.969 --> 1:09:33.166
- Who's the Adam man?

1:09:33.201 --> 1:09:34.376
- Logan.

1:09:34.411 --> 1:09:35.212
Run now!

1:09:48.392 --> 1:09:50.150
- Notify the elders.

1:09:50.185 --> 1:09:51.393
Yes, Agent Pietra.

1:09:51.428 --> 1:09:53.989
I need you to get
me Logan's address.

1:09:54.024 --> 1:09:56.189
No, I need it now,
it's an emergency,

1:09:56.224 --> 1:09:58.598
and don't tell anyone, please.

1:10:07.378 --> 1:10:09.235
- The jugs look cool.

1:10:09.270 --> 1:10:12.612
Looks like crystal,
but the wine is cheap.

1:10:13.615 --> 1:10:15.109
It gets the job done though.

1:10:19.753 --> 1:10:21.885
Come on, let's dance.

1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:22.721
- Logan!

1:10:25.858 --> 1:10:27.561
- I'll kill you!

1:10:29.928 --> 1:10:31.191
- I'll kill you!

1:10:33.602 --> 1:10:36.702
- You keep moving and
I will slit her throat!

1:10:36.737 --> 1:10:37.868
- Who are you?

1:10:37.903 --> 1:10:40.442
Take me, just let her go.

1:10:40.477 --> 1:10:41.773
I'll give whatever you want.

1:10:41.808 --> 1:10:45.414
- You know the
evil ones loves the innocent.

1:10:45.449 --> 1:10:46.877
The more innocent they are,

1:10:46.912 --> 1:10:49.913
the more he enjoys their
souls on the other side.

1:11:02.829 --> 1:11:03.960
- Son of a bitch!

1:11:19.142 --> 1:11:20.416
- You're gonna die.

1:11:20.451 --> 1:11:21.945
You're gonna die
like your brother.

1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:23.309
Suffer a witch not to live!

1:11:23.344 --> 1:11:24.882
- No, Logan!

1:11:24.917 --> 1:11:26.983
It's a corrupt town, they'll
do you up for murder.

1:11:27.018 --> 1:11:28.457
You take her.

1:11:28.492 --> 1:11:30.085
Come on, wake up, come on.

1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:32.494
You go to the pizza
joint, you go right now.

1:11:32.529 --> 1:11:33.759
I'll clean this mess up

1:11:33.794 --> 1:11:35.156
and then you can come back.

1:11:35.994 --> 1:11:36.795
Go!

1:11:40.405 --> 1:11:41.701
I'll meet you in front
of the pizza joint.

1:11:41.736 --> 1:11:43.637
I'll clean this mess up
then you can come back.

1:11:43.672 --> 1:11:44.473
Go!

1:11:46.642 --> 1:11:48.103
You're gonna die,

1:11:48.138 --> 1:11:49.940
just like all the innocent
blood you spilled.

1:11:49.975 --> 1:11:52.481
Like my brother in
California, remember that?

1:11:53.616 --> 1:11:55.308
- You killed
before, Agent Pietra.

1:11:55.343 --> 1:11:57.112
You're one of us now!

1:11:57.147 --> 1:11:58.311
You'll kill again!

1:12:10.666 --> 1:12:12.864
- At least I got a new
car out of the deal,

1:12:12.899 --> 1:12:14.261
these wack job witches.

1:12:23.008 --> 1:12:26.482
Listen, don't say
anything to anybody.

1:12:26.517 --> 1:12:29.716
And remember an old Republican
book I read long ago.

1:12:29.751 --> 1:12:32.818
Loose lips sink
ships, you got it?

1:12:32.853 --> 1:12:33.852
- Got it.

1:12:33.887 --> 1:12:35.854
And about that Wexford killer.

1:12:35.889 --> 1:12:36.657
Are you him?

1:12:36.692 --> 1:12:38.087
Because we need to know.

1:12:39.156 --> 1:12:40.595
- Yeah, we deserve to know.

1:12:40.630 --> 1:12:42.157
Just tell us.

1:12:42.192 --> 1:12:43.499
- Look.

1:12:43.534 --> 1:12:45.402
Whatever they say about
me, remember this.

1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:49.736
Anybody I took out worked
for the devil himself.

1:12:49.771 --> 1:12:51.397
They killed babies!

1:12:51.432 --> 1:12:53.366
They killed children!

1:12:53.401 --> 1:12:57.513
Every week, every high
holiday, all year long!

1:12:57.548 --> 1:12:58.712
It's real!

1:12:58.747 --> 1:12:59.977
It's real, you get it?

1:13:01.112 --> 1:13:02.782
And I can't live if I know that.

1:13:04.016 --> 1:13:05.488
I don't want to live
in a world like that.

1:13:05.523 --> 1:13:07.116
Somebody has to stand up.

1:13:08.383 --> 1:13:09.624
We all should stand up.

1:13:11.452 --> 1:13:13.353
Now get rid of that job,
get out of the hospital,

1:13:13.388 --> 1:13:15.388
get that pizza job and
don't ever go back.

1:13:15.423 --> 1:13:16.433
I'm sorry.

1:13:17.601 --> 1:13:20.261
Look, I gotta check on Malichi,
make sure he's all right

1:13:20.296 --> 1:13:21.229
then I'm on the ferry.

1:13:21.264 --> 1:13:22.197
You guys be safe.

1:13:25.675 --> 1:13:29.402
You'll be all right,
take care of yourself.

1:13:48.159 --> 1:13:49.466
Father Malichi.

1:13:55.496 --> 1:13:58.574
- The police were
here for hours.

1:13:58.609 --> 1:14:03.546
Interpol as well, one
British and one American.

1:14:03.581 --> 1:14:04.481
- American?

1:14:05.616 --> 1:14:07.110
They're calling in the cavalry.

1:14:07.145 --> 1:14:09.277
They want me dead.

1:14:09.312 --> 1:14:12.588
- But I'm surprised you
trusted me enough to come here.

1:14:12.623 --> 1:14:16.383
I'll give you sanctuary, but
you need to leave the island.

1:14:16.418 --> 1:14:19.925
On a ferry, but not
from Wexford, from Cork.

1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:21.597
There's the tickets.

1:14:21.632 --> 1:14:24.600
It's in my name so
you'll need my passports.

1:14:24.635 --> 1:14:27.966
And here's a little
bit of money.

1:14:28.001 --> 1:14:30.133
- Why are you doing this for me?

1:14:30.168 --> 1:14:32.938
- It's against my
better judgment.

1:14:32.973 --> 1:14:36.139
But when I saw how those
demons reacted to you

1:14:36.977 --> 1:14:38.515
in that exorcism, I knew.

1:14:39.815 --> 1:14:42.310
I knew who you were.

1:14:42.345 --> 1:14:44.653
- You knew
I was what, Father?

1:14:44.688 --> 1:14:47.513
- I knew you were the anointed.

1:14:47.548 --> 1:14:49.020
- Anointed?

1:14:49.055 --> 1:14:51.627
I'm not anointed, I'm cursed!

1:14:51.662 --> 1:14:53.486
You know how many
people I've killed?

1:14:54.698 --> 1:14:56.159
You know how many
witches I've killed?

1:14:57.327 --> 1:14:59.800
- Agent Pietra, you were chosen.

1:14:59.835 --> 1:15:02.462
We're in the end times.

1:15:02.497 --> 1:15:05.168
First thing, earth
is consumed by water,

1:15:05.203 --> 1:15:06.807
and then by fire.

1:15:06.842 --> 1:15:09.645
But you can't do it from here.

1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:14.540
You must take the
battle to Babylon.

1:15:14.575 --> 1:15:15.409
- Where's Babylon?

1:15:17.281 --> 1:15:18.687
- America.

1:15:18.722 --> 1:15:20.546
Feds were here earlier.

1:15:20.581 --> 1:15:22.823
They mean to kill you,
they won't let you live.

1:15:24.024 --> 1:15:25.859
You know what they did
to our blessed Lord

1:15:25.894 --> 1:15:27.289
when they got
their hands on him?

1:15:27.324 --> 1:15:30.699
That's what they mean for you.

1:15:30.734 --> 1:15:33.900
I think somehow
they're all involved.

1:15:35.563 --> 1:15:37.640
- Father, angels are real.

1:15:37.675 --> 1:15:40.533
I saw one, a little
boy named Gabriel!

1:15:44.605 --> 1:15:46.979
I've never seen this
picture of Jesus before.

1:15:48.719 --> 1:15:50.719
Father, I don't feel well.

1:15:51.887 --> 1:15:53.513
I don't feel well.

1:15:55.451 --> 1:15:56.791
- Agent Pietra?

1:16:00.863 --> 1:16:02.863
- My wrists are on fire!

1:16:04.702 --> 1:16:05.800
- Stigmata.

1:16:44.599 --> 1:16:45.807
- Arrest Pietra.

1:16:45.842 --> 1:16:47.941
What are you waiting for?

1:17:02.793 --> 1:17:04.122
- Stay back!

1:17:04.157 --> 1:17:06.894
Stay back, don't
touch the anointed.

1:17:06.929 --> 1:17:10.623
Don't touch my
prophet, stay back!

1:17:10.658 --> 1:17:11.459
Stay back!

1:17:12.869 --> 1:17:14.297
You swine!

1:17:14.332 --> 1:17:16.772
You're all swine, you'll burn

1:17:16.807 --> 1:17:18.807
in bloody hell for this!

1:17:18.842 --> 1:17:19.841
- Shoot him.

1:17:20.701 --> 1:17:22.239
Kill the bastard!

1:17:22.274 --> 1:17:23.009
- But sir.

1:17:23.044 --> 1:17:23.845
- Shoot him!

1:17:28.885 --> 1:17:30.786
- The bleeding stopped.

1:17:37.190 --> 1:17:38.189
- Oh my God!

1:17:40.061 --> 1:17:41.995
- You are God's soldier.

1:17:42.030 --> 1:17:43.491
His hammer.

1:17:43.526 --> 1:17:44.701
- I'm no soldier!

1:17:45.770 --> 1:17:47.660
I'm a murderer!

1:17:47.695 --> 1:17:51.202
- For the greater good.

1:17:51.237 --> 1:17:52.665
- Act of contrition, Father.

1:17:52.700 --> 1:17:55.338
Last rites, now for
yourself, say it!

1:17:55.373 --> 1:17:57.274
- Oh my God.

1:17:57.309 --> 1:18:02.312
I'm heartily sorry for
having offended thee.

1:18:02.952 --> 1:18:04.853
I repent of all my sins

1:18:06.648 --> 1:18:09.616
because I fear
the loss of heaven

1:18:11.323 --> 1:18:13.730
and dread the pains of hell.

1:18:16.933 --> 1:18:18.031
- You bastards!

1:18:18.869 --> 1:18:21.496
You fucking bastards!

1:18:21.531 --> 1:18:23.333
You killed a priest!

1:18:23.368 --> 1:18:25.038
- Put him in the car!

1:18:54.069 --> 1:18:55.761
- Ma'am.

1:18:55.796 --> 1:18:56.806
- Thank you.

1:19:00.801 --> 1:19:04.176
You know what to do if
anything goes wrong.

1:19:04.211 --> 1:19:06.046
- Of course ma'am,
shoot to kill.

1:19:08.886 --> 1:19:10.677
- Jeanie?

1:19:10.712 --> 1:19:12.855
You feel better, don't you?

1:19:12.890 --> 1:19:15.682
- Doctor, at the
moment I feel good.

1:19:15.717 --> 1:19:17.519
I wanna thank you, Doctor.

1:19:17.554 --> 1:19:20.863
It is such a wonderful
feeling to feel.

1:19:20.898 --> 1:19:22.865
- Merged together as one?

1:19:22.900 --> 1:19:24.724
Is that how you feel, honey?

1:19:24.759 --> 1:19:25.560
- No.

1:19:26.464 --> 1:19:27.760
No, Doctor.

1:19:27.795 --> 1:19:32.809
I feel as if an anchor
was taken from my neck.

1:19:33.306 --> 1:19:34.536
I feel light.

1:19:34.571 --> 1:19:37.847
I don't feel merged,
I feel light.

1:19:37.882 --> 1:19:39.046
- Tomorrow
you will see,

1:19:39.081 --> 1:19:40.806
I will show you the braces scans

1:19:40.841 --> 1:19:43.919
and you will know and
understand the science, okay?

1:19:46.814 --> 1:19:48.616
- What is this tattoo, Doctor?

1:19:49.817 --> 1:19:53.489
It doesn't suit such an
elegant lady, I don't like it.

1:19:53.524 --> 1:19:56.899
- Okay, we're going
to take a rest then.

1:19:56.934 --> 1:19:59.968
Tomorrow I will
take you to places

1:20:09.375 --> 1:20:12.310
Oh, come on, you
put your coat here.

1:20:12.345 --> 1:20:13.806
Do you feel better?

1:20:13.841 --> 1:20:15.918
- I feel better.

1:20:15.953 --> 1:20:20.450
- Yeah, tomorrow, I will try
to get us some ice cream.

1:20:20.485 --> 1:20:22.386
'Cause tomorrow you will be part

1:20:22.421 --> 1:20:25.455
of a really
beautiful ritual too.

1:20:25.490 --> 1:20:28.854
Please, Myler,
bring me the tiara.

1:20:28.889 --> 1:20:30.295
- What ritual, Doctor?

1:20:30.330 --> 1:20:33.826
- Hmm, you're such
a blessed woman.

1:20:33.861 --> 1:20:37.500
You have been chosen
from high places, honey.

1:20:41.011 --> 1:20:45.277
You are chosen.

1:20:45.312 --> 1:20:46.542
Blessed be.

1:20:46.577 --> 1:20:49.347
You are chosen to be
the mother of darkness.

1:20:54.552 --> 1:20:57.652
Tomorrow in the
grove, you shall be...

1:20:59.392 --> 1:21:00.688
You shall be...

1:21:01.559 --> 1:21:03.691
You just rest tonight, okay?

1:21:03.726 --> 1:21:05.495
Go back inside.

1:21:05.530 --> 1:21:06.859
- Agent Pietra?

1:21:06.894 --> 1:21:08.069
Agent Pietra!

1:21:08.104 --> 1:21:09.136
- Jeanie.
- Hey!

1:21:09.171 --> 1:21:11.072
Hey, Agent Pietra, what
are you doing here?

1:21:11.107 --> 1:21:12.733
Wait, he's here!
- He's just coming now.

1:21:12.768 --> 1:21:15.175
He's just visiting us.
- He's the one who helped me,

1:21:15.210 --> 1:21:16.704
he prayed for me!

1:21:16.739 --> 1:21:18.013
- Jeanie, you need to rest.

1:21:18.048 --> 1:21:19.575
We'll see you bright and early.

1:21:19.610 --> 1:21:22.083
And for Agent Pietra, as long
as he submits to science.

1:21:22.118 --> 1:21:23.612
He's got to just
listen to the science.

1:21:23.647 --> 1:21:26.120
- This had nothing
to do with science!

1:21:26.947 --> 1:21:29.882
Agent Pietra, Agent Pietra!

1:21:29.917 --> 1:21:31.994
- Remember your braces scans?

1:21:32.029 --> 1:21:33.655
He got one this
morning like you did

1:21:33.690 --> 1:21:35.558
and you got all better.

1:21:35.593 --> 1:21:37.890
- Yeah I remember,
it didn't hurt.

1:21:39.069 --> 1:21:41.069
- Go take a rest, Jeanie.

1:21:41.104 --> 1:21:42.829
- I don't want an ice cream!

1:21:42.864 --> 1:21:43.599
No, I want Logan!

1:21:43.634 --> 1:21:44.930
Where is Logan?

1:21:44.965 --> 1:21:46.239
- Logan got another job.
- Logan!

1:21:46.274 --> 1:21:47.768
He's the only one
who didn't kiss me!

1:21:47.803 --> 1:21:49.242
No, no!

1:21:49.277 --> 1:21:50.738
Agent Pietra!

1:21:50.773 --> 1:21:51.981
Agent Pietra!

1:21:52.016 --> 1:21:53.774
- No!

1:21:53.809 --> 1:21:57.250
- What are
you doing to me?

1:22:21.177 --> 1:22:22.077
- Why, God?

1:22:23.872 --> 1:22:25.476
Why is life so dark?

1:22:27.975 --> 1:22:29.018
Why?

1:22:43.628 --> 1:22:44.429
Gabriel!

1:22:45.927 --> 1:22:48.070
- Agent Pietra,
please listen to me.

1:22:48.105 --> 1:22:49.137
You have only one chance.

1:22:49.172 --> 1:22:50.798
It will be your only chance.

1:22:50.833 --> 1:22:53.108
Father has instructed
me to unlock your door

1:22:53.143 --> 1:22:55.671
like I did Peter's
in the old times.

1:22:55.706 --> 1:22:57.211
But you have one chance.

1:22:57.246 --> 1:22:59.807
You will run out and you
will go to the forest.

1:22:59.842 --> 1:23:02.216
- No, but we have to
go to the next cell.

1:23:02.251 --> 1:23:03.547
We have to save Jeanie!

1:23:03.582 --> 1:23:05.087
We have to get her out of here!

1:23:05.122 --> 1:23:05.978
You have to help me!

1:23:06.013 --> 1:23:08.255
- That is not
Father's instructions.

1:23:08.290 --> 1:23:09.751
The mystery will be revealed

1:23:09.786 --> 1:23:11.753
but you will run through
the door and go right

1:23:11.788 --> 1:23:13.095
and leave now.

1:23:13.130 --> 1:23:14.195
Do not stop and do
not get Jeanie out,

1:23:14.230 --> 1:23:15.493
it is not the plan!

1:23:19.565 --> 1:23:20.696
- I gotta save Jeanie!

1:23:23.173 --> 1:23:24.370
- Sonny, don't stop!

1:23:24.405 --> 1:23:26.174
It's not part of the plan!
- Jeanie!

1:23:26.209 --> 1:23:27.241
Jeanie, Jeanie!

1:23:29.971 --> 1:23:33.181
- Sonny!

1:23:33.216 --> 1:23:33.973
Sonny!

1:23:34.008 --> 1:23:34.875
- Run!

1:23:34.910 --> 1:23:36.008
They're gonna hurt you!

1:23:36.043 --> 1:23:37.977
Run, run!
- Sonny, no!

1:23:38.012 --> 1:23:39.088
- Just run!

1:23:39.123 --> 1:23:42.058
They're gonna kill
you, run, run!

1:23:46.196 --> 1:23:47.822
- Ma'am, Pietra's doing a run.

1:23:47.857 --> 1:23:50.528
- Come help me save
Jeanie, Gabriel.

1:23:50.563 --> 1:23:51.793
Come!

1:23:51.828 --> 1:23:53.531
- Run to the forest now
and don't look back.

1:23:53.566 --> 1:23:54.565
- What, sir?

1:24:01.343 --> 1:24:02.870
- Sonny, don't look back!

1:24:23.167 --> 1:24:24.397
- Run, Jeanie!

1:24:43.286 --> 1:24:45.220
- Clean up that slobber.

1:24:45.255 --> 1:24:48.157
- I'd have shot
his ass last night.

1:25:26.626 --> 1:25:27.889
- Hey, you're American.

1:25:27.924 --> 1:25:29.264
You sure you wanna
drive here, man?

1:25:31.026 --> 1:25:32.531
- I'm cool, man, I'm cool.

1:25:39.936 --> 1:25:41.639
- How long
to Dublin airport?

1:25:41.674 --> 1:25:42.871
- About an hour, ma'am.

1:25:46.316 --> 1:25:49.680
- Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the Lord.

1:25:49.715 --> 1:25:51.253
- Watch out for the truck!

1:25:51.288 --> 1:25:52.287
- Stay left!

1:26:40.161 --> 1:26:41.831
- It's been a year now.

1:26:41.866 --> 1:26:44.339
It feels like a haunting wind.

1:26:44.374 --> 1:26:45.538
- A haunting wind.

1:26:45.573 --> 1:26:48.475
Yes, Dolores, it feels
like a haunting wind.

1:26:48.510 --> 1:26:50.807
I don't care what anyone
else said about him.

1:26:52.415 --> 1:26:55.108
Hey kid, you gotta
respect this place.

1:26:57.420 --> 1:26:59.387
- Sorry, I was just playing.

1:27:00.522 --> 1:27:01.752
He was a good man.

1:27:01.787 --> 1:27:03.886
A bit of a temper but
he had a good heart.

1:27:09.124 --> 1:27:11.124
- Kid, you don't
have an Irish accent.

1:27:12.897 --> 1:27:15.865
- I'm not a kid, an I'm not
from around these parts.

1:27:16.802 --> 1:27:18.868
- Did you know Agent Pietra?

1:27:23.611 --> 1:27:24.973
- He worked for my father.
