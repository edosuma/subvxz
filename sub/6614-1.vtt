00:25.257 --> 00:26.893
<i>Breaking News.</i>

00:26.894 --> 00:30.463
<i>There's been an incident at the
Monte Vista High School lock-in.</i>

00:30.464 --> 00:33.900
<i>Two LAPD officers were at the
scene and witnessed the crime.</i>

00:33.901 --> 00:36.068
<i>We go now live to Monte Vista</i>

00:36.069 --> 00:39.005
<i>where students were gathered
for the annual school dance.</i>

00:39.006 --> 00:41.474
<i>Well, Officer Lagney and
I arrived at the scene</i>

00:41.475 --> 00:44.844
to find these "packs" of gang members
in the midst of gun violence.

00:44.845 --> 00:49.816
We immediately pounced the evildoers and
we had the situation under control.

00:49.817 --> 00:53.519
Yeah, we have to take care of this
before more innocent kids are hurt.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.088
Bunch of savages.

00:56.089 --> 01:00.092
Animals that belong in a zoo.

01:00.093 --> 01:04.864
<i>First of all, that cop is
high as hell. Look at him.</i>

01:04.864 --> 01:09.068
<i>Second of all, that's not even how it went
down. Let me rewind to the beginning.</i>

01:11.638 --> 01:14.574
<i>This was actually the
greatest night of my life.</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:17.109
<i>Would you believe me if I told
you it was a tale of love?</i>

01:17.110 --> 01:18.911
<i>The cops may have
labeled it a tragedy,</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:20.847
<i>but you can never trust the police.</i>

01:20.848 --> 01:23.015
<i>Hey, this is my story.</i>

01:23.016 --> 01:25.918
<i>So I should tell you, it'll
probably be a little racist.</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:28.087
<i>Where you gonna be at tonight?</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:30.656
<i>You best believe that you're gonna
be over at Monte Vista High School</i>

01:30.657 --> 01:32.892
<i>because it's going down.</i>

01:32.893 --> 01:34.627
<i>Supa Sizers out there with their
smash hit</i> The Hater Dance

01:34.628 --> 01:36.629
<i>will be in the neighborhood, man.</i>

01:36.630 --> 01:40.032
<i>It's Power 106's annual "Unity
in the Community" school dance</i>

01:40.033 --> 01:41.534
<i>going down at Monte
Vista High School.</i>

01:41.535 --> 01:42.902
<i>Power 106.</i>

01:47.573 --> 01:49.509
Well, I love that Supa Sizer.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.245
That motherfucking <i>Hater
Dance</i> song is the shit.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.126
I'm not gonna give in to
that Supa Sizers' song.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.250
Press it just as soon as I can.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.918
You want Mamma to
walk you in, baby?

01:58.919 --> 02:00.586
No, Mamma, I'm good.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.054
You ain't good, nigga.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.258
You ain't about four feet
goddamn tall. Hold on.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.826
Your Mamma coming.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.526
I don't want nobody
fucking with my baby.

02:13.165 --> 02:14.665
Ma!

02:15.167 --> 02:17.435
I protects my baby.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.805
Come on.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.974
Let's go.

02:21.975 --> 02:26.212
Now, listen. If some shit goes down,
I want you to page me, all right?

02:26.213 --> 02:29.215
Ma, nobody uses pagers
no more. We got iPhones.

02:29.216 --> 02:32.316
Man, I know what's going on in
these streets, God help you.

02:32.985 --> 02:35.219
Ma, I promise, I'm good.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.859
All right, well, listen, I gotta get
to the motherfucking church anyway.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.294
Go in there and make Mamma
proud. Learn something.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.829
Give Mamma a kiss,
little baby, before I go.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.146
Kiss me, nigga, before I blow...

03:14.293 --> 03:15.628
I love you.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.798
Take care and learn something today.
Make Mamma proud, you little bitch.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.699
Tell your teacher I said, "Hey."

03:21.000 --> 03:22.668
You got something for me?

03:22.669 --> 03:24.836
Yeah, I got something. Hold on.

03:25.938 --> 03:27.206
All right.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.175
Roll on, I got you. I got you.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.610
You don't put that football
down, I'll fuck your ass up.

04:15.054 --> 04:18.156
The Rangers, those
dudes are amazing.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.660
Best dance clique in our school.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.894
And one of them is
actually my older cousin.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.764
Day Day.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.266
I met him at a family reunion once,

04:27.267 --> 04:30.136
but I don't even think
he remembers my name.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.705
See, man, I'd do anything to
be down with that clique.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.207
Now, that's what it's
about here. Cliques.

04:35.208 --> 04:40.112
Now, they're not gangs, but it's
far from that study-buddy shit.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.915
It's more so sororities
and fraternities

04:42.916 --> 04:45.217
without the college education
and social benefits.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.253
Let me explain.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.922
Each school is divided and
segregated into cliques.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.290
Monte Vista is no different.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.792
You got your backpackers,

04:52.793 --> 04:54.860
the nerds,

04:54.861 --> 04:57.897
the vegan, tree-loving dreadheads.

04:57.898 --> 05:02.368
You got your dirty ghetto
kids aka your hood skaters.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.870
Oh, and that's Stinkfinger.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.039
<i>Across the street,</i>

05:07.040 --> 05:09.709
<i>you'll find the lamest fools
to ever set foot in the hood.</i>

05:09.710 --> 05:11.410
Girl, let me carry your
books for you, girl.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.779
<i>They all dropped out of
school like 10 years ago</i>

05:13.780 --> 05:16.749
<i>but these fools still up
here every single day.</i>

05:16.750 --> 05:19.752
<i>Bunch of old wannabe gangsters
who wanna holler at young chicks</i>

05:19.753 --> 05:21.120
<i>but always fail miserably.</i>

05:21.121 --> 05:22.988
We're not carrying any books.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.224
And if we were, you wouldn't
be able to touch them.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.159
You wanna carry these
balls then, bitch?

05:27.160 --> 05:31.330
Yeah, put the balls in
your book bag, bitch.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.898
Told the bitch to carry my balls.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.366
Say what?

05:34.367 --> 05:35.735
I said, "Carry my balls, bitch."

05:35.736 --> 05:37.336
Come again, say what?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.604
- Let's ride out.
- I know. That's right.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.808
<i>Then there's the Ese's.</i>

05:42.809 --> 05:44.243
<i>The real gangsters.</i>

05:44.244 --> 05:47.146
<i>Legend has it if you look one of
them in the eye, you could die.</i>

05:47.147 --> 05:50.850
<i>Where we come from, blacks and
Mexicans have never gotten along.</i>

05:50.851 --> 05:53.953
<i>It's the ghetto civil
war that defies logic.</i>

05:53.954 --> 05:57.423
<i>It's like vegetarians beefing
with vegans. It's the same shit.</i>

05:57.424 --> 06:01.060
<i>See what I did there?</i>

06:01.061 --> 06:05.464
<i>And the most notorious badass
Ese of them all is Big Junior.</i>

06:05.465 --> 06:08.834
<i>A while ago he got sent to prison
for burning down a school dance</i>

06:08.835 --> 06:12.204
<i>'cause he thought some blind guy
was looking at his little sister.</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:14.540
<i>Who just so happens to be
the girl of my dreams.</i>

06:14.541 --> 06:17.042
<i>Anastacia Moreno.</i>

06:17.043 --> 06:20.880
I've been in love with her since we shared
a nap-time towel in the first grade.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.816
<i>I was so nervous,
I pissed on myself,</i>

06:23.817 --> 06:25.785
<i>all over the towel, all over her.</i>

06:26.787 --> 06:28.821
I sure enough did.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.990
She hasn't looked my way since.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.292
It's probably because we're from
two totally different worlds.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.094
<i>I mean, she's a Sweet Gyrl.</i>

06:35.095 --> 06:38.998
<i>A part of the hottest female clique
that my school has ever birthed.</i>

06:38.999 --> 06:42.234
<i>Let's take a moment to enjoy.</i>

07:02.521 --> 07:04.590
<i>Man, look at her.</i>

07:04.591 --> 07:08.059
<i>She's the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.</i>

07:11.530 --> 07:13.030
Wait a minute.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.733
Is she looking at me?

07:17.069 --> 07:19.138
Jason B.B. Jackson.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.041
Oh, this is my shot.
This is my moment.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.609
Seize the opportunity.

07:33.185 --> 07:35.487
Go get 'em, buckaroo.

07:35.488 --> 07:38.958
<i>Oh, yeah, I forgot to introduce
you to the Prairie Puff Man.</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:41.493
<i>The tobacco industry's
propaganda pitchman</i>

07:41.494 --> 07:43.462
<i>that's been killing kids for years.</i>

07:43.463 --> 07:46.063
I wasn't always super cool.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.501
Till I discovered these.

07:49.502 --> 07:53.239
<i>My mother smokes eight packs
of these death-doobies a day.</i>

07:53.240 --> 07:55.174
<i>And since she's a single parent,</i>

07:55.175 --> 07:57.610
<i>he's the only man I've
ever seen in my house.</i>

07:57.611 --> 08:00.045
<i>Prairie Puff Man is
like my guardian angel.</i>

08:00.046 --> 08:01.313
Don't cheat.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.448
<i>My role model.</i>

08:06.286 --> 08:07.653
Go get 'em, buckaroo.

08:22.534 --> 08:24.835
My nigga, what the fuck, bro?

08:29.041 --> 08:30.342
What's that?

08:33.645 --> 08:36.181
<i>Worst moment in the history
of fucked-up-ness.</i>

08:36.182 --> 08:38.816
<i>Ay!</i> He's so little.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.955
It looks like a dick but smaller.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.024
That is gross.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.261
Little dude ain't even circumcised!

08:49.262 --> 08:51.430
What was that, bro? Why you even
looking at this nigga's dick?

08:51.431 --> 08:53.532
This nigga's dick
look like Franklyn.

08:57.269 --> 08:58.938
Hey, bro, pull your pants up.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.699
He's still sitting there
with his pants down.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.075
Hey! Wait up!

09:03.076 --> 09:04.710
<i>Attention! It's 7:45.</i>

09:04.711 --> 09:08.614
<i>Will the student who lost
their prosthetic leg</i>

09:08.615 --> 09:11.583
<i>please hop your ass down here to
the guidance counselor's office.</i>

09:11.584 --> 09:13.784
Hey, guys! Hey, guys! Wait up.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.989
Yo, how can I be a Ranger?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.158
I know everything about y'all.
I got all your mix-tapes.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.726
I know all your dance moves.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.061
I was even thinking of
getting a Ranger tattoo.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.295
Yo, this nigga is a stalker.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.316
I'll do whatever it takes, I swear.

09:26.198 --> 09:28.067
Okay, little
piggy-in-the-blanket dick.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.235
You really want that Ranger life?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.936
Day Day, whip it out.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.642
Memorize it.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.677
Now, if you want to pledge
to be in the illest clique,

09:38.678 --> 09:41.080
you got to get the drawers off
one of the illest chicks.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.248
That's right. Panties.

09:43.249 --> 09:47.486
When you come back with a fresh pair
of Sweet Gyrl panties, you're in.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.722
Uh, can't it be like
a sock or something?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.290
Panties!

09:51.291 --> 09:52.890
Like these.

09:54.526 --> 09:57.129
These are Keisha's from last night.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.163
She just gave you those?

09:58.164 --> 10:00.065
For sure.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.667
All right, now here come
them sugar drawers.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.569
Take your pick, little dude!

10:16.749 --> 10:19.084
Yo, yo, yo, snap out
of it, Un-Circky!

10:19.085 --> 10:21.153
This Ranger shit is real.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.322
South Central wasn't
built in no day.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.091
So can you pull it off or what?

10:26.092 --> 10:28.227
Uh, when am I supposed
to have this done?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.361
Tonight.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.031
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.333
But you just said South Central
wasn't built in a day.

10:34.334 --> 10:38.170
Uh, I don't know what that shit
means. I just be saying shit.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.372
Y'all expect me to have sex

10:40.373 --> 10:42.274
with one of the most untouchable
girls in our school tonight?

10:42.275 --> 10:43.642
Yeah.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.743
That's not even humanly possible.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.712
Yeah, it is.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.548
Tonight is the "Unity in the
Community" school dance, fool.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.183
And it's a lock-in.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.552
And you know what happens
at the lock-in, boy.

10:57.089 --> 11:01.427
Okay, for those of you that don't know
what a lock-in is, let me explain.

11:01.428 --> 11:05.697
<i>In an attempt to give all races and classes
of students a safe party environment,</i>

11:05.698 --> 11:07.666
<i>and keep them away
from gang violence,</i>

11:07.667 --> 11:11.370
<i>we have an all-night campus party
that culminates in a sleep over,</i>

11:11.371 --> 11:13.105
<i>in the gym.</i>

11:13.106 --> 11:15.006
<i>Nice, safe and wholesome, right?</i>

11:15.274 --> 11:17.476
<i>Wrong.</i>

11:17.477 --> 11:20.512
<i>Instead of the lock-in, they
need to call it the "get it in."</i>

11:20.513 --> 11:23.615
<i>Because that's all that's
happening all night long.</i>

11:23.616 --> 11:26.877
<i>Everybody sneaks off somewhere
to get their freak in...</i>

11:27.152 --> 11:30.556
<i>drink in, smoke in,</i>

11:30.557 --> 11:34.326
<i>and frolic in.</i>

11:34.327 --> 11:38.530
<i>But the main attraction is the
Power 106 concert and talent show.</i>

11:38.531 --> 11:43.235
<i>Last year The New Boyz took home
$2,000 and a major label record deal.</i>

11:43.236 --> 11:44.703
<i>Their lives changed forever.</i>

11:44.704 --> 11:46.538
<i>And they're coming back
this year to judge</i>

11:46.539 --> 11:48.774
<i>and give another act a
ticket out of the hood.</i>

11:48.775 --> 11:50.409
Oh, shit, y'all.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.277
We're late! We better get to class.

11:52.278 --> 11:55.280
Nigga, we're The Rangers. We're not
worried about being late to class.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.250
Yeah, we run this school. This
school don't run us, extra meat.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.651
Yeah, nigga. Quit tripping.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.221
I'm with the big dogs
running this school.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.123
This school don't run us.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.624
Ain't that right, dude?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.625
Langston?

12:18.604 --> 12:21.306
Tardy, tardy, tardy!

12:21.307 --> 12:24.308
Get your Hot Pocket-sized
ass to my office!

12:26.512 --> 12:28.679
In here, sir.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.151
Little-ass homie, in here.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.253
Ain't that a rip?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.588
Damn. That's what's
wrong with you kids.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.758
Your mind is filled
with all that bullshit.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.228
I'm sick of it. If I was your daddy,
I'd be the one who tore your ass up.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.797
I wouldn't play here. I wouldn't
put up with none of it.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.538
That's right. I'm trying to...

12:48.367 --> 12:50.636
Ooh!

12:50.637 --> 12:54.177
Look at that. Look at that. Look at that.
Look at that, that, that, that...

12:55.941 --> 12:58.844
Stop looking at my girl.

12:58.845 --> 13:01.713
I'm gonna tell you one time and
I ain't gonna tell you no more.

13:01.714 --> 13:06.385
Keep your eyes and your
mind off my bitch.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.062
I mean, my faculty. I'm sorry
about that, Mrs. Johnson.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.526
She hears every damn
thing. Everything!

13:14.527 --> 13:16.795
Yeah, she is a bitch sometimes.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.762
I needs to talk to you.

13:20.265 --> 13:22.201
About that little butt-naked
dance you just did

13:22.202 --> 13:24.768
out there on the quad
just a minute ago.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.207
Well...

13:28.208 --> 13:29.474
I'm not circumcised either.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.780
And I'm sixty-some years old,
still ain't circumcised.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.282
Join the club!

13:37.283 --> 13:39.850
You've got a turtle-neck
little dick, too.

13:40.586 --> 13:41.954
You got a German Shepherd dick.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.889
I got a German Shepherd dick.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.525
You got a Sean John leather on
your dick. That's what you got.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.859
That's right. Levi leather.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.764
I know it. When your little dick
gets a little blanket lint on it,

13:52.765 --> 13:54.333
and cookie crumbs, stuff like that,

13:54.334 --> 13:55.534
it's hard to blow out.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.237
I know what you're talking about
'cause I deal with it all the time.

13:58.238 --> 14:02.407
You ain't even gotta use a condom.
Just twist the tip up like a balloon.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.476
That little ball will pop up.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.076
More pleasure!

14:07.512 --> 14:09.648
- Principal Rogers.
- What?

14:09.649 --> 14:11.817
Is there any reason that you
have me in your office?

14:11.818 --> 14:14.686
Yes, there's a reason
why I got you in here.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.355
I wanted to ask you something.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.724
You having a problem out
with 'em Ranger boys?

14:18.725 --> 14:20.659
The Rangers?
No, they're my friends.

14:20.660 --> 14:24.529
That's what I'm talking about.
See that! See that!

14:24.530 --> 14:26.565
I'm sitting here trying to defend
you and you're running with 'em!

14:26.566 --> 14:27.966
I'm gonna tell you
something, Jebediah,

14:27.967 --> 14:29.868
you're trying to start
some shit around here.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.404
The Rangers, now, all of a
sudden, is your friends.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.039
Ain't that a bitch.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.475
You run around here fooling
with the Mexican kids.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.710
They're gonna fuck one of
y'all up, up around here.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.847
Somebody's gonna bend you, spin you
and go up in you. This is my school.

14:41.848 --> 14:45.450
And I won't play that. I don't
like any of them one bit!

14:45.451 --> 14:48.353
Are you getting initiated
into a gang, young Jiminey?

14:48.354 --> 14:52.457
Uh, my name is Jason,
and no, I'm not.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.992
Cut the... I'm gonna tell
you something, Jethro.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.295
You're gonna try and
start a race riot.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.897
You better leave them Mexican kids
alone, they're gonna jump on you.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.333
Yeah, four to five of them are
gonna jump on your little ass.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.902
They're gonna have Home Depot little
jackets on, they don't play the fool.

15:06.371 --> 15:08.972
Yeah. Damn shit.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.310
You think it's a game?

15:11.311 --> 15:12.911
You think it's a game?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.913
You're gonna end up on <i>First 38.</i>

15:16.848 --> 15:18.784
<i>- First 38.</i>
<i>- I thought it was 48.</i>

15:18.785 --> 15:20.384
Yeah, it's 38, nigga.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.988
Yes.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.090
I hear you need one more volunteer
teacher tonight for the lock-in.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.326
And you heard right, baby.
I need you here.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.894
Quicker than a cat
can lick his ass.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.829
All right, great.
I'll see you there.

15:36.635 --> 15:39.071
- I'm gonna tear that ass up tonight.
- Huh?

15:39.072 --> 15:42.007
Are you going to the
school dance tonight?

15:42.008 --> 15:46.043
Yeah, come on. Get your little nosey
ass out of here. Get on out of here.

15:50.982 --> 15:52.482
<i>The Hater Dance.</i>

15:53.352 --> 15:54.852
<i>The Hater Dance.</i>

15:55.454 --> 15:56.988
<i>The Hater Dance.</i>

15:56.989 --> 15:58.488
Oh!

16:16.842 --> 16:19.010
What the fuck?

16:19.011 --> 16:22.346
It seems like today is
your unlucky day, Day.

16:23.548 --> 16:25.382
That's funny, fool.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.619
Yeah.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.454
Yo, why y'all messing with me?

16:29.455 --> 16:31.489
I know you got some lawns
to mow or something.

16:35.894 --> 16:39.930
So, Day Day, you have a
really important phone call.

16:43.668 --> 16:45.103
Who's this?

16:47.073 --> 16:49.539
What? Nigga, speak English.
Who's this?

16:51.042 --> 16:56.948
It's Junior. Just got out
and he wants his money.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.518
Yeah, don't keep him holding
on the phone, Holmes.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.621
That's rude.

17:02.622 --> 17:06.491
My bad, Junior. I didn't know it
was you. How did you get out?

17:06.492 --> 17:08.727
I thought you were in
jail for triple life.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.099
Look, man, I got your money.
Don't worry.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.035
<i>Insert 25 cents for another minute.</i>

17:20.807 --> 17:22.874
What did he say?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.176
Don't ask me, fool.
I don't speak Spanish.

17:31.616 --> 17:35.285
$2,000 by midnight or
Junior's gonna kill you.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.590
Shit.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.930
2 grand.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.766
Where am I gonna get
that from by midnight?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.634
- Day Day, you cool?
- Hell no.

17:49.635 --> 17:53.238
These Ese's are threatening me over
some shit my wack-ass father did!

17:53.239 --> 17:54.773
Uncle D-Smoke?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.975
Yeah, that lying-ass nigga, Darren.

17:56.976 --> 18:02.614
See, my mamma thought it would be a good
idea for me to go visit him in prison.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.216
Say, "Hi, Daddy!" Say, "Hi, Daddy!"

18:04.217 --> 18:07.085
Hi, Daddy.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.120
Whose goddamn white baby is that?

18:09.121 --> 18:12.990
This is your baby, okay? He's
just light skinned. Mmm-hmm.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.060
That one might be mine.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.028
That one right there,
I'm not totally sure.

18:17.029 --> 18:20.632
Just because you named him Darren
don't mean he belongs to Darren.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.101
But I don't care what
this baby's name is,

18:23.102 --> 18:25.704
this baby is rice skinned
but not light skinned.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.239
That is a white child.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.242
That is Caucasian from the
mountains of Caucasus.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.845
That is a Slavic baby,
a Viking from Iceland.

18:33.846 --> 18:38.750
That baby got 730 as a credit
rating right now as an infant.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.619
You the only one I've
been with, Darren.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.823
Bitch, let me explain to you the math.
I've been in here 16 consecutive years.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.225
You know how long
"consecutive" is, don't you?

18:47.226 --> 18:50.529
Okay, so, it means one right
after the motherfucking other.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.197
'Cause I ain't never missed a day.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.966
So clearly you've been
having some conjugal visits

18:54.967 --> 18:57.168
with some other motherfuckers
other than me.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.137
That's not my baby.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.774
That's almost a grown white
man you've brought in here.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.676
His glasses are certainly grown.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.646
I've never seen a baby with
that type of prescription.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.149
And why does that baby
look like Officer Joshua?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.817
Bitch, you've been
fucking the guard?

19:12.818 --> 19:14.920
Ew! Nuh-uh!

19:14.921 --> 19:18.056
Hey, Darren, stop talking to my mom
like that, man. Be respectful.

19:18.057 --> 19:22.093
You're absolutely right.
I apologize for that.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.962
- It's just that this bitch...
- Damn it. There you go again.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.566
Your mother was misbehaving.

19:27.567 --> 19:31.836
Sorry, I should've set a
better example in front of

19:31.837 --> 19:35.006
the nice white gentleman
and your mother.

19:35.007 --> 19:39.744
All right, so, could I please speak
to my black son privately, please?

19:39.745 --> 19:41.313
- Would that be okay with you, Trina?
- Mmm-hmm.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.081
I mean you no disrespect, sir.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.183
Hope to work for you one
day when I get out.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.985
Come on, baby.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.819
Raggedy head...

19:51.690 --> 19:54.624
You have to excuse me, son.
This is my first white baby.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.260
What's up, man?

19:57.829 --> 19:59.598
I'm in a jam.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.334
- What?
- Uh...

20:02.335 --> 20:07.270
There was a gambling
incident and I need, like,

20:07.772 --> 20:10.775
13,000 cigarettes, preferably 6,000

20:10.776 --> 20:15.080
of those non-menthol and then
like 5,000 pineapple fruit cups.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.848
That's worth about $2,000

20:16.849 --> 20:18.249
on the open street market.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.819
If you can handle that for
me, I'd appreciate it.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.254
Darren, what are you talking about?

20:23.255 --> 20:26.658
Well, see, what had happened was...

20:26.659 --> 20:30.328
Wait, you're gonna do a
flashback within a flashback?

20:30.329 --> 20:31.863
Nigga, you know you can't do that.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.632
Nigga, I'm a criminal.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.767
That's what I do, what
I'm not supposed to do.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.302
So, now.

20:37.303 --> 20:38.803
What had happened was...

20:40.839 --> 20:44.776
<i>No Mexican has ever beat
me in Dominoes. Ever.</i>

20:44.777 --> 20:46.978
<i>But one day the cash
was on the line,</i>

20:46.979 --> 20:49.779
<i>I had been sipping that lean
and he caught me slipping.</i>

20:52.785 --> 20:55.186
What's this got to do with me?
This is your problem.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.222
Uh, I didn't have the money,

20:57.223 --> 20:59.924
and in lieu of the money,

20:59.925 --> 21:03.361
I told Junior and his crew
that I had a rich son

21:03.362 --> 21:07.866
in a famous rap group, and I'm
sure a little funky $2,000

21:07.867 --> 21:10.702
don't mean nothing when he's
clocking all the dollars out there,

21:10.703 --> 21:12.804
Mr. Major Buckety Bucks.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.839
What? Man, we ain't signed yet.
I ain't got no money.

21:17.308 --> 21:20.278
All right, well, let's
not be a Gloomy Gus.

21:20.279 --> 21:24.049
Okay, if you didn't learn nothing
from your white brother, learn

21:24.050 --> 21:27.152
always look on the
bright side of life.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.254
But you still haven't
given him any money?

21:29.255 --> 21:31.956
No, I gave him an
orange this morning.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.859
But they're already trying to
make me make small booty payments

21:34.860 --> 21:37.201
and I only got a small
booty to work with.

21:39.397 --> 21:42.300
Look here, man, um,
I only got one booty hole.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.736
You understand what I'm saying?

21:44.737 --> 21:49.974
They don't take debit or credit or
nothing in here, it's just hole. Okay?

21:49.975 --> 21:52.077
I've been holding
onto it for 16 years.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.212
I don't see no reason
to let it go now

21:54.213 --> 21:58.817
over a few little pineapple
fruit cups and some cigarettes.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.019
Speaking of which, I need
you to do me a favor.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.723
You think you can
listen to these for me?

22:04.724 --> 22:07.392
That's disgusting, man. Where'd
you pull that out from?

22:07.393 --> 22:10.028
Oh, from my Louis
Vuitton prison bag.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.163
Nigga, what do you think?
I pulled them out of my ass.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.799
You ain't got to smell it.
Just listen to it.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.000
I know. I know. It's time.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.969
Look, I only got a few seconds

22:17.970 --> 22:21.272
before they snatch me up out
of here 'cause I'm a gangster!

22:21.273 --> 22:23.842
But look, I need you
to save my sphincter.

22:23.843 --> 22:27.112
You gonna embarrass me in front of that
white man's child, you better lock me down!

22:27.113 --> 22:29.748
Some father I got, huh?

22:29.749 --> 22:32.117
Now I gotta pay Junior by midnight.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.517
Anyway, you get them drawers yet?

22:35.520 --> 22:39.357
I'm just messing with you.
Come on, bro, we got PE.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.992
Wait, you noticed I
was in your PE class?

22:40.993 --> 22:44.896
Yeah, man. I've seen you there before,
looking all un-athletic and shit.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.134
Let's keep this Junior
thing between me and you.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.535
<i>It's 11:00. Get your
wretched ass into class!</i>

22:56.107 --> 22:59.344
<i>Man! I'm in a tight situation.</i>

22:59.345 --> 23:01.479
<i>Go ahead. Keep laughing at my pain.</i>

23:01.480 --> 23:04.115
<i>But the struggle is real!</i>

23:04.116 --> 23:07.552
<i>Big Junior just magically got
released from a triple life sentence.</i>

23:07.553 --> 23:09.420
<i>And he's on a mission to
kill my cousin Day Day.</i>

23:09.421 --> 23:11.089
<i>And probably me too,
once he finds out</i>

23:11.090 --> 23:13.992
<i>I'm trying to get his
sister's panties.</i>

23:13.993 --> 23:17.529
<i>Are those panties
really worth dying for?</i>

23:17.530 --> 23:21.432
<i>She probably got some
really nice panties.</i>

23:21.433 --> 23:23.868
<i>I guess I gotta do what I gotta do.</i>

23:23.869 --> 23:25.970
<i>It's like my man Shakespeare said,</i>

23:25.971 --> 23:29.207
<i>"Love is a smoke, made
from the fumes of sighs,</i>

23:29.208 --> 23:32.342
<i>"being purged, a fire
sparkling in lovers' eyes."</i>

23:36.548 --> 23:39.017
Get your asses up
for some aerobics.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.585
Stand your asses up!

23:40.586 --> 23:44.289
Don't make Coach mad today.
Don't make me mad! Come on now.

23:44.290 --> 23:48.593
Let's get into this <i>Hater Dance,</i>
shall we? 5, 6, 7 and 8.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.929
And to the left.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.996
Whoo! Yeah!

23:52.997 --> 23:54.499
Come on, guys.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.101
Man, what the hell you
doing, piddly dick?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.037
Move like you got some
damn rhythm. Come on.

23:59.038 --> 24:02.106
Now step, yeah, side to side, yeah,
side to side, yeah, side to side.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.707
Oh, yeah! Keep going.

24:04.209 --> 24:05.709
Mmm!

24:06.211 --> 24:07.777
Do the dance.

24:10.181 --> 24:13.117
Not so hard, Venkatesh!
Not so hard. Okay?

24:13.118 --> 24:15.186
Hey. I'm so sick of this damn song!

24:15.187 --> 24:18.888
Yeah, but I do like the way B3's
booty shakes to that dance. Mmm!

24:19.390 --> 24:21.526
What's a B3?

24:21.527 --> 24:24.028
Man, you gotta keep up with the
acronyms if you're gonna be a Ranger.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.130
B3 is Big Booty Becky.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.565
Oh.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.400
Come on, J-Extra. Let's
roll over there right now.

24:29.401 --> 24:32.637
I like that, J-Extra.
That's your new name.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.906
Yeah. That's right.
Dougie's with it, boy.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.688
That's the Fredrick Douglass
right there, you old nigga.

24:38.576 --> 24:40.345
Can we help you, little boy?

24:40.346 --> 24:42.547
No love. Little homie with us.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.383
Oh, I'm sorry, Langston.
I didn't know.

24:45.384 --> 24:48.987
Hey. Didn't we go to
pre-school together?

24:48.988 --> 24:53.690
Uh, me? No. See, I'm from Nigeria.

24:54.192 --> 24:55.759
Oh!

24:56.427 --> 24:58.296
Oh...

24:58.297 --> 25:02.100
Yeah. That's it. You peed
on me in elementary school.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.502
- What?
- What?

25:04.503 --> 25:09.140
What are y'all doing, not participating
in my calisthenics, huh?

25:09.141 --> 25:12.543
Coach, we're tired of doing that
fake-ass electric slide, man.

25:12.544 --> 25:14.379
<i>The Hater Dance</i> is
loved by everybody.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.546
We don't like it.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.382
Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:17.383 --> 25:20.518
Baby Chris Rock face. Why you
hate <i>The Hater Dance,</i> huh?

25:20.519 --> 25:24.422
You gotta like it! Okay?

25:24.423 --> 25:26.925
We're about what's
popping next, not now!

25:26.926 --> 25:29.560
Yeah, we about to give you a little
taste of what we gonna do tonight.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.396
- Check it out!
- Who painted your back?

25:31.397 --> 25:32.964
Little Negro division?

25:32.965 --> 25:34.945
Watch this, little niggas.

27:02.754 --> 27:06.024
Yo, we killed that. We
definitely gonna win tonight.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.392
Bro, you already know what's up.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.360
I know you saw how
Jasmine was on me.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.262
That's gonna be my
butt down tonight.

27:11.263 --> 27:14.132
Nigga, yeah, right! You
know her daddy's a pastor.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.068
What? Are you doubting
the powers of a Ranger?

27:17.069 --> 27:19.604
My fault. I repent.

27:19.605 --> 27:22.473
Yo, yo. Check that out. That's
confidence right there.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.742
Day Day still ain't gonna smash,
but at least he's confident.

27:26.244 --> 27:30.415
I don't know, bro. This whole Sweet Gyrl
thing's a little bit out of my league.

27:30.416 --> 27:33.351
I couldn't even get my
name out. I blew it.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.353
Don't trip, you'll
get another chance.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.222
No, you won't, little nigga.

27:38.223 --> 27:40.224
<i>Mrs. Johnson, report to the office.</i>

27:40.225 --> 27:42.725

28:14.593 --> 28:15.860
Move, man! Word!

28:15.861 --> 28:17.495
Man, that's why The Rangers is gay.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.097

Everyone, take out your poems

I hope you students ain't
fronting on some bitch-ass shit

30:44.509 --> 30:46.611

Miss Moreno, late again.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.035
Sorry, Ms. Billingsly.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.739
You must think Billingsly
is a punk bitch?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.874
Because you are treating
me like a bitch,

31:16.875 --> 31:18.776
coming up in my class
all late and shit!

31:18.777 --> 31:21.579
Ms. Billingsly, it's
not even like that.

31:21.580 --> 31:24.849
And I bet your ass didn't do the
homework assignment either, huh?

31:24.850 --> 31:27.818

Uh-huh?

31:33.358 --> 31:38.929
I mean, I liked it. It's formatted
correctly. The words are beautiful.

31:38.930 --> 31:40.698
You just forgot to
put your name on it.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.034
So, you didn't think
it was too long?

31:43.035 --> 31:45.134
Nah, you're perfect. It's perfect.

31:45.636 --> 31:47.136

actually do some work.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.880
Well, I have got to hear this shit!

31:55.881 --> 32:00.384
Miss Moreno, do us the honor
of reciting that poem.

32:00.385 --> 32:03.888
- What?
- To the front of the class, Miss Moreno.

32:03.889 --> 32:05.790

34:19.157 --> 34:21.891
But now it's time
to rope this filly.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.061
- Man, what you talking about?
- Here she comes.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.462
Jason. Jason!

34:27.231 --> 34:31.168
Oh, my God! She gave me an A!

34:31.168 --> 34:34.004
She even wrote, "Your
poem was the shit!"

34:35.540 --> 34:37.975
I wish I was as good
a writer as you.

34:37.976 --> 34:41.679
I mean, you're talented.
I've seen you.

34:41.679 --> 34:47.885
Really? I mean, I've got the vocals.
Just not much of a songwriter.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.820
Maybe you should let
me help you with that.

34:49.821 --> 34:53.289
Yeah? That would be cool.

34:54.024 --> 34:55.860
I guess I owe you now.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.928
No. You don't owe me.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.764
It's the least I could do after
peeing on you in pre-school.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.602
- I knew I wasn't crazy. That was you.
- That was really stupid.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.669
Man, shut up! Shit.

35:07.238 --> 35:09.139
- Excuse me?
- Huh?

35:09.140 --> 35:13.309
I said shut up to all them haters.
And, uh, give me your number.

35:13.811 --> 35:15.411
Okay.

35:24.121 --> 35:27.758
So, you should give
me a call sometime.

35:27.759 --> 35:29.860
And maybe we can write
a song together.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.794
Yeah. I'd like that.

35:33.731 --> 35:35.299
Fuck you, niggas.
How you do that shit?

Oh, and aren't you going

35:37.969 --> 35:39.803
Uh, yeah. Uh-huh.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.605
- Cool! I'll see you there then.
- Yeah.

Look who finally got a
little confidence. Yeah.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.292
Got a little bit of swag, too!

36:01.293 --> 36:03.794
You actually got her number.
I can't believe it.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.563
- That's right.
- You know he ain't gonna do nothing with it

36:05.564 --> 36:07.865
but get ink on his dick
when he's jacking off.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.702
Aw, shit!

36:11.703 --> 36:14.038
Who raggedy-ass shit is that?

Here, see what happened is she's

36:48.907 --> 36:50.808
Mamma, they was my friends.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.569
You ain't got no fucking
friends. Quit lying.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.881
Hold on. Hold on. What's happening?

36:57.882 --> 36:59.984
Hey, man, come on. Mamma.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.386
Old lady. You see me
out here dancing?

37:02.387 --> 37:05.656
Crip walking and shit! You're out
here interrupting my swag, lady.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.958
Yeah, bitch! You
interrupting his swag, ho!

37:07.959 --> 37:10.260
- How about I interrupt your life?
- Oh shit. Shit done got real!

37:10.261 --> 37:12.062
Everybody, chill! No. No. No.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.064
Look at me. It's cool, lady.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.666
I'm not worried about that little
squirt-gun you got, nigga.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.702
- I got pussy hair tougher than you.
- Yeah, it's on top of your lip, bitch!

37:18.703 --> 37:20.443
- Motherfucker!
- All right!

37:36.153 --> 37:38.188
What seems to be the
problem, Percy?

37:38.189 --> 37:40.424
Nothing, Uncle. Everything cool
around here. We're straight!

37:40.425 --> 37:43.060
I've done told you little motherfuckers
to stop coming up to this school,

37:43.061 --> 37:44.762
you grown-ass niggas.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.997
You trying to gangbang?
You need to bang a job!

37:46.998 --> 37:48.932
I done told you about
selling drugs around here.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.968
Come on, we ain't getting
nobody into that.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.404
We ain't in that life. We just say no
to that. Ain't that right, my nigga?

37:53.405 --> 37:54.872
Excuse me, say what?

37:54.873 --> 37:57.107
- I said, "We say no to drugs, nigga!"
- Come again. Say what?

37:57.108 --> 37:59.943
No.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.312
Percy, you think you slick.
I'm on your ass.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.682
I'm on your ass like stink on shit!

38:04.683 --> 38:07.117
Look, I told you to stop calling me
Percy in front of my homies, man.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.952
It's OG Lil' Pretty Thug.
You know what it is.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.056
Pretty thug! A pretty thug?

38:12.057 --> 38:14.623
You look like a pretty
little chimpanzee!

38:15.392 --> 38:17.526
Not when I do this.

38:18.262 --> 38:19.363
Amazing!

38:19.364 --> 38:21.965
You look like OG Meerkat.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.701
- Meerkat?
- Yeah, you look like a little meerkat.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.936
All four of you is short!
You understand?

38:25.937 --> 38:28.437
All of you can do a
flip under the bed.

38:30.074 --> 38:33.010
Nigga, are them the shoes with
the wheels on the bottom of 'em?

38:33.011 --> 38:35.471
You up here at the school
with some Heelys on?

38:35.946 --> 38:37.815
I'm crazy!

38:37.816 --> 38:42.219
Now, let this student and
this beautiful super-model...

38:42.220 --> 38:44.440
- Thank you, baby!
- ...come on through.

38:44.955 --> 38:46.924
See you. I'm gonna see you.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.425
- Move, bitches!
- You're gonna leave 'em alone around here.

38:48.426 --> 38:52.229
Hit me again. Built
like a goddamn car!

38:52.230 --> 38:54.797
Call me when you want a
ride too, motherfucker!

38:55.299 --> 38:58.168
Yes, Lord!

38:58.169 --> 39:02.139
This milkshake brings all the boys
to the yard, son. Trust and believe!

39:02.140 --> 39:03.841
I'll stick my face in that ass.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.242
- You'd get stuck.
- Oh!

39:05.243 --> 39:08.010
That's how I got your
daddy to knock me up.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.981
Knocked me good and up!

39:10.982 --> 39:12.750
I want you to stay out
of my woman's face.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.018
- You're not going with that bitch.
- Yeah. Get on out of here.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.887
Or what? Or what? You sure?

39:16.888 --> 39:18.756
Let's roll. Let's roll, nigga.

39:18.757 --> 39:21.125
Start, bitch! God damn it!

39:21.126 --> 39:22.926
All of you better be in a car
seat when you leave here.

39:22.927 --> 39:24.328
Easy, cuz! Easy, cuz!

39:24.329 --> 39:26.562
Get your ass out of here!

39:31.136 --> 39:33.103
Fucking piece-of-shit car.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.239
Fuck this raggedy motherfucker.

39:35.240 --> 39:39.009
I don't give a fuck, bitch.
Go around, bitch. Go around!

39:39.010 --> 39:42.478
Shit. I don't give a fuck. What the
fuck you looking at, motherfucker?

39:45.215 --> 39:50.120
<i>Now, going live to the LAPD
eyewitness ride-along.</i>

39:50.121 --> 39:53.457
So, this is what we like to do all day. We
survey the land and look for evildoers.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.325
And we like picking up bitches!

39:55.326 --> 39:57.494
What the fuck would you say
that in the camera for?

39:57.495 --> 40:00.798
- You don't like picking up bitches?
- I love picking up bitches.

40:00.799 --> 40:04.168
But I don't say it in the camera.
Holy shit! Rock the cockblock!

40:04.169 --> 40:06.003
We got some serious

40:06.004 --> 40:07.304
rocking the cockblock right here.

40:07.305 --> 40:09.406
- Pull over, fuckers.
- We are in hot pursuit!

40:09.407 --> 40:11.275
They're pulling over. We got
ourselves a hot tamale right here.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.277
Oh! Rock the cockblock!

40:13.278 --> 40:17.181
This is what taxpayers pay for right
here and these boys are mine, baby!

40:18.850 --> 40:22.718
<i>Rock the cockblock! Yeah!</i>

40:27.090 --> 40:28.492
Turn the music down!

40:28.493 --> 40:30.027
Huh?

40:30.028 --> 40:31.927
Turn the music down!

40:32.429 --> 40:33.831
What?

40:33.832 --> 40:36.233
Turn the fucking music down!

40:36.234 --> 40:39.236
Hold on, I can't hear you. The music
is too loud! Let me turn it down.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.038
How fast you were going?

40:41.039 --> 40:43.373
Um...

40:43.374 --> 40:46.143
Apparently not fast enough,
Officer, since you caught us.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.546
Obviously these guys
are on drugs. Okay?

40:49.547 --> 40:51.915
Do you have any
paraphernalia in the car?

40:51.916 --> 40:53.417
- Any weapons?
- No, sir!

40:53.418 --> 40:58.155
I mean, ma'am. Officer Penis?

40:58.156 --> 41:01.325
It's P'eniss. It's French.

41:01.326 --> 41:04.928
Hey, Penis, all we got is these
brownies my grandmother made

41:04.929 --> 41:08.565
and this non-alcoholic grape
drink to wash it down with.

41:08.566 --> 41:11.401
<i>- Really? Can I have some of that?
- Yeah, man.</i>

41:11.402 --> 41:12.870
<i>- Where's the drink?
- You want some?</i>

41:12.871 --> 41:14.538
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

41:14.539 --> 41:16.874
<i>What the fuck are you doing?
This isn't a restaurant!</i>

41:16.875 --> 41:19.209
I'm starving. I didn't have
anything to eat today.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.044
But you can't eat shit from them.

41:21.045 --> 41:23.113
- Your grandmother made these?
- Yes, sir.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.515
These are amazing! You tell
her, she needs her own show.

41:25.516 --> 41:29.052
This is ridiculous shit!
Get out of the car!

41:29.053 --> 41:31.321
You have to be firm
and authoritative

41:31.322 --> 41:33.657
so that these perps
treat you with respect.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.598
Cockblock!

41:36.026 --> 41:38.161
<i>Hot pursuit! Hot pursuit!</i>

41:38.162 --> 41:42.199
<i>Two black men in a white Rolls
Royce going down Fairfax.</i>

41:42.200 --> 41:43.934
<i>Roger that, Officer Penis!</i>

41:43.935 --> 41:45.734
It's P'eniss!

42:07.158 --> 42:10.494
Yeah, man. I'm gonna have to make you work
the corners. Make us some money, man!

42:10.495 --> 42:13.964
Whatever, Holmes!
I can feel the burn!

42:13.965 --> 42:16.133
This thing works.
I feel like Bruce Lee.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.102
We better start rehearsing if we are
gonna win the talent show tonight.

42:19.103 --> 42:21.204
I got some cool moves.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.440
Hey, pretty bitches!

42:23.441 --> 42:26.476
I know you didn't just disrespect
us and call us bitches.

42:26.477 --> 42:29.179
What you talking about disrespecting?
Ain't nobody disrespect you!

42:29.180 --> 42:32.349
I said pretty bitches. Disrespecting
you is calling you ugly bitches!

42:32.350 --> 42:34.051
It's a compliment, bitch.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.152
Them bitches don't know.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.154
<i>Ay,</i> he does have a point.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.622
Thank you.

42:38.623 --> 42:41.959
Damn, he is kinda cute, in a little
chocolate Smurf type of way.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.962
It's me, baby. You see it.

42:44.963 --> 42:48.098
You guys can't be serious.
Do you hear your friends?

42:48.099 --> 42:50.167
Come on, you guys, let's go inside.

42:50.168 --> 42:52.970
This bitch over here acting
like a See-You-In-Tijuana.

42:52.971 --> 42:54.604
Hey, why don't you stop cockblocking,
you little Mexican bitch.

42:54.605 --> 42:56.707
You see, she over here
trying to get it.

42:56.708 --> 43:00.043
Let your girl get it. Over here,
fucking up game. Stankin' bitch!

43:00.044 --> 43:02.112
Mexican bitch!

43:02.113 --> 43:03.413

43:03.414 --> 43:05.716
Shit! Let's go! Let's go!

43:07.685 --> 43:09.985
We are funny! We are...

43:10.487 --> 43:12.422
Look at this bitch!

43:12.423 --> 43:14.324
What's that you called my sister?

43:14.325 --> 43:17.461
- What the fuck?
- The fuck you are rolling up on for, cuz?

43:17.462 --> 43:18.462
- Huh?
- He must don't know. He can't know.

43:18.463 --> 43:20.230
He can't know.

43:20.231 --> 43:22.599
I said, "Stop cockblocking,
you little Mexican bitch!"

43:22.600 --> 43:24.368
- Fucked, my boy!
- That's what I said, cuz!

43:24.369 --> 43:25.769
This nigga got me fucked up!

43:25.770 --> 43:27.604
Man, show 'em what
you do. Oh, shit!

43:27.605 --> 43:30.574
- Hold on, nigga.
- It's back here. There you go!

43:30.575 --> 43:32.309
OG Lil' Pretty Thug, nigga!
Okay. Now what?

43:32.310 --> 43:33.610
I'm about to put
this nigga in a box.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.412
Don't do it. Calm down.
You know how you get.

43:35.413 --> 43:37.514
Six feet under, nigga! You hear me?

43:37.515 --> 43:39.516
- Funeral service! Nigga, I...
- It's seven now. It's seven feet...

43:39.517 --> 43:41.218
Nigga, I'm talking

43:41.219 --> 43:42.486
- Boy!

43:42.487 --> 43:44.588

43:44.589 --> 43:47.157
- Okay!

43:47.158 --> 43:49.026
- Comeback! Comeback! Comeback!
- You got me fucked up, cuz!

43:49.027 --> 43:50.794
- Pretty Thug, nigga! You understand?
- Comeback! Okay!

43:50.795 --> 43:52.529
- You don't know, ask somebody.
- Okay!

43:52.530 --> 43:55.399
Don't fuck around and get shot
by a pretty nigga, nigga!

43:55.400 --> 43:56.800
- What is he talking about?
- Excuse me, what?

43:56.801 --> 43:58.802
I said, "OG Lil' Pretty Thug!"

43:58.803 --> 44:00.270
- Come again, say what?
- I'm... I'm telling...

44:00.271 --> 44:02.139
Oh, shit!

44:05.076 --> 44:07.310
Oh, shit. This

44:07.311 --> 44:09.479
Fucking thug, nigga.
I'll kill you, bitch!

44:09.480 --> 44:12.149
Oh, Jesus Christ and the Latter
Day Saints. What the fuck?

44:12.150 --> 44:14.217
Bam! Get the grenade
on this nigga, man!

44:14.218 --> 44:16.653
- Get us a what?
- Grenade this nigga, man!

44:16.654 --> 44:18.587
Pray to him! Pray to him!

44:20.691 --> 44:22.559
Put him down! He
don't deserve that.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.161
Get this cholo, nigga!

44:24.162 --> 44:26.929
Damn! I'm too pretty for this shit.

44:34.071 --> 44:35.472
God damn! That nigga threw you!

44:37.308 --> 44:38.575
Shit!

44:38.576 --> 44:40.342
Oh, shit! Nigga!

I feel that shit!

44:45.416 --> 44:46.850
Enough! Enough!

Listen to me!

44:49.620 --> 44:50.720
Shit!

44:50.721 --> 44:53.190
I always wanted to do that, eh?

44:53.191 --> 44:55.491
Hey, Bam, grab my gun!

44:55.492 --> 44:56.793
Excuse me, say what?

44:56.794 --> 44:58.562
Grab my gun!

44:58.563 --> 45:00.430

45:00.431 --> 45:03.871
I can't understand you. Oh, shit!
Hey, you can't shoot a nigga...

45:03.872 --> 45:06.136
with Jesus on their face. Now
come on, in the name of Allah!

45:06.137 --> 45:08.672
Don't do it. Fall back,
Holmes. Fall back.

45:08.673 --> 45:10.172
Okay!

45:17.714 --> 45:20.048
What's that you said
about my sister?

45:20.750 --> 45:23.018
Will about mine, cuz...

45:27.891 --> 45:29.226
No bullets?

45:30.828 --> 45:33.695
This motherfucker put
no bullets in his gun.

45:34.898 --> 45:37.518
Looks like your life is
full of blanks, fool.

45:39.537 --> 45:42.305
Hey, that's The New Boyz?
They just cut their new album.

45:42.306 --> 45:43.872
Fuck that shit.

45:44.641 --> 45:46.143
Just come on, nigga!

45:46.144 --> 45:49.146
I'm not getting up.

45:49.147 --> 45:51.481
This nasty! I've been
fucked up, nigga.

45:51.482 --> 45:52.482
Y'all got me fucked up!

45:52.483 --> 45:54.351
All the way up.

45:54.352 --> 45:58.053
You talking like a real gigo. You
talking like a real gigo, man.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.326
Oh, shit! We made it to World Star?

46:03.327 --> 46:04.628
Man, that shit's crazy.

46:04.629 --> 46:06.229
Hey, nigga, I killed
them niggas off.

46:06.230 --> 46:07.731
Ain't that some good shit.

46:07.732 --> 46:09.566
- Hey, y'all.
- Hear that, nigga.

46:09.567 --> 46:11.835
Look whose mom finally
let him out the house.

46:11.836 --> 46:14.604
Hey, y'all are wack. You

46:14.605 --> 46:18.575
Ghetto-ass mama. She
care about gun play.

46:18.576 --> 46:21.311
Did you see your little cameo
on World Star? Check it out.

46:21.312 --> 46:22.546
Got a million views.

46:22.547 --> 46:23.747
Is it tight?

46:23.748 --> 46:25.715
<i>Yo!</i>

46:27.585 --> 46:29.252
Loser!

46:29.253 --> 46:31.254
Langston, can I use your
phone to call Anastacia?

46:31.255 --> 46:32.822
Why don't you call at your crib?

46:32.823 --> 46:35.492
Well, we don't have a house phone.

46:35.493 --> 46:37.460
All we got is my mom's pager.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.863
Besides, I need the moral
support from my guys, you know?

46:39.864 --> 46:42.030
I'm mad nervous, y'all.

46:42.566 --> 46:45.235
For sure. Call her.

46:45.236 --> 46:48.904
And I'm gonna call George
Kush and light up this blunt.

46:51.708 --> 46:53.944
You know what? I can't
believe they beat my record.

46:53.945 --> 46:58.548
You know I hold the record for
most videos retired on 106...

46:58.549 --> 47:00.850
And this one is smashing it.
How many days it's been over?

47:00.851 --> 47:03.386
Cut it! 78 days!

47:18.802 --> 47:20.270
Hello!

47:20.271 --> 47:22.037
Yo, it's Jason.

47:23.006 --> 47:25.006
Who the hell is Jason?

47:25.742 --> 47:27.944
What do you want with my daughter?

47:27.945 --> 47:32.315
Hey, sir, it's Jason and I want
to speak with Anastacia, sir.

47:32.316 --> 47:33.917
Man, you didn't answer my
question. Who are you?

47:33.918 --> 47:36.486
And what the fuck do you
want with my daughter?

47:36.487 --> 47:40.357
Uh... Me and Anastacia are ass-mates...
I mean classmates!

47:40.358 --> 47:42.459
We share a room...

47:42.460 --> 47:45.328
We share a classroom and I
help her with her homework.

47:45.329 --> 47:47.664
And I wanted to know if she
needed any more help... Help...

47:47.665 --> 47:48.965
If she needed me to help
her with her homework.

47:48.966 --> 47:53.068
- 'Cause I helped her with her homework.
- Hold on. Anastacia!

47:54.004 --> 47:55.837
I'm coming.

48:01.444 --> 48:03.111
Hello?

48:03.947 --> 48:05.781
Hey, Anastacia.

48:06.283 --> 48:08.485
Jason?

48:08.486 --> 48:11.520
Yeah. I thought this
was your cell phone.

48:12.656 --> 48:15.358
I lost my cell phone.
This is my home phone.

48:15.359 --> 48:16.992
What's up?

48:17.627 --> 48:21.064
Uh, nothing. What's up with you?

48:21.065 --> 48:23.433
Hey, yo, tell her to put the
phone up to her coochie!

48:25.369 --> 48:26.569
Shut up!

48:26.570 --> 48:27.871
- Excuse me?
- Uh...

48:27.872 --> 48:30.807
Nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing.

48:30.808 --> 48:33.310
Um...

48:33.311 --> 48:35.879
I guess I'll see you
later on at the lock-in.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.947
Later on.

48:37.948 --> 48:39.815
I guess so.

48:56.833 --> 48:58.968
Straight crash and burn!

48:58.969 --> 49:01.037
You got all shook when her
dad got on the phone.

49:01.038 --> 49:03.006
It was downhill from there.

49:03.007 --> 49:05.642
She probably thinks you are a
big-ass dork right about now.

49:05.643 --> 49:07.510
I told you about them
Mexican daddies, man.

49:07.511 --> 49:09.612
No niggers in <i>mi casa,</i> fool!

49:09.613 --> 49:13.049
Confidence, bro. That's all it is.
Stop being so fuckin' nervous.

49:13.050 --> 49:15.116
Yeah, virgin!

49:21.491 --> 49:23.360
Who was that on the phone?

49:23.361 --> 49:25.729
Nobody. It was just
a friend from school.

49:25.730 --> 49:29.032
- He was helping me with homework.
- Oh, yeah? He's helping you out.

49:29.033 --> 49:32.535
And your little friend from
school. Is he a <i>negrito?</i>

49:32.536 --> 49:34.137
What does it matter?

49:34.138 --> 49:37.607
<i>Orale,</i> Kim Kardashian?
Now you're dating black guys?

49:37.608 --> 49:39.008
- Papa!
- Papa?

49:39.009 --> 49:40.777
Don't papa me.

49:40.778 --> 49:44.013
Okay, I know how suave
black guys are.

49:44.014 --> 49:48.651
They talk to you with that Mack Daddy
lingo, holding their giant penises.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.988
All right, and I could tell by
this kid's voice, over the phone,

49:51.989 --> 49:54.389
it was all deep, he's
got a giant <i>palo.</i>

49:54.891 --> 49:56.393
No, he doesn't.

49:56.394 --> 49:57.660
What did you say?

49:57.661 --> 49:59.496
Nothing.

49:59.497 --> 50:02.699
Look, Ana, you're a beautiful
Latina, which means...

50:02.700 --> 50:04.000
Which means what?

50:04.001 --> 50:07.437
Which means you're fertile as hell.

50:07.438 --> 50:11.007
I don't want some little black
nappy-headed baby with a big penis

50:11.008 --> 50:14.811
running around this house, touching all
my shit, and leaving him for me to raise.

50:14.812 --> 50:16.713
- I can't believe we're talking...
- Big black baby.

50:16.714 --> 50:18.782
about this right now. I'm a virgin.

50:18.783 --> 50:23.586
I didn't run off like you and Mom
and get pregnant when I was 16.

50:23.587 --> 50:27.123
All right, well, at least I stuck
around to take care of my children.

50:27.124 --> 50:30.727
Those black guys come around with their
cool talk and they get you in bed,

50:30.728 --> 50:33.496
and when you get pregnant,
they turn into magicians.

50:33.497 --> 50:34.898
Magicians?

50:34.899 --> 50:38.001
Yeah, magicians, like that <i>acho</i> we
saw at the casino, David Coppertone.

50:38.002 --> 50:39.836
- Yeah, Coppertone.
- He was good.

50:39.837 --> 50:40.837
- Yeah, it was funny.
- The rabbits?

50:40.838 --> 50:42.705
Yeah, they were cute.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.140
They disappear.

50:44.141 --> 50:46.843
I don't want you to become
a statistic. All right?

50:46.844 --> 50:50.613
I'm telling you because I want you to
take care of yourself. I care about you.

50:50.614 --> 50:53.883
Papa, don't worry about me.
Worry about your sons.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.052
Like Junior, the one that
just got out of jail?

50:58.221 --> 50:59.756
Or this one.

50:59.757 --> 51:01.624
The 18-year-old who
still wears slippers

51:01.625 --> 51:03.126
because he doesn't know
how to tie his shoes.

51:03.127 --> 51:05.093
Hmm?

51:06.629 --> 51:08.965
Oh, no, I know how to tie my shoes.

51:08.966 --> 51:11.634
I just think the concept
of laces is stupid.

51:11.635 --> 51:14.504
I would have to agree
with Flaco on that one.

51:14.505 --> 51:17.140
Who asked you to talk,<i>ese,
and why are you always here?</i>

51:17.141 --> 51:20.643
Yeah. Why are you always here?

51:20.644 --> 51:22.045
What do you mean? I'm family.

51:22.046 --> 51:23.813
How are you family, fool?

51:23.814 --> 51:26.581
Yeah. How are you family, fool?

51:28.718 --> 51:31.888
I'm second cousin to your third
cousin's <i>cunado, El Machete,</i>

51:31.889 --> 51:33.656
who married Consuela,
who was married

51:33.657 --> 51:35.892
to Pablo before and
then escaped to the US.

51:35.893 --> 51:39.696
After that, <i>El Machete</i> took care
of me, and then he disappeared.

51:39.697 --> 51:41.965
So, I didn't know what to do.
So I just came here.

51:41.966 --> 51:44.106
And that's all I have
to say about that.

51:45.101 --> 51:47.237
And you want me to be
with somebody like this?

51:47.238 --> 51:49.270
Gosh, Papa.

51:50.006 --> 51:52.942
Shit, she might have a point.

51:54.678 --> 51:57.013
<i>Power 106! DJ Sully Sal.</i>

51:57.014 --> 52:00.783
<i>The moment you've been
waiting for is going down.</i>

52:00.784 --> 52:02.986
We're gonna lock your asses in.

52:02.987 --> 52:06.723
<i>At the talent contest we will
be making some stars tonight.</i>

52:06.724 --> 52:08.892
<i>You know how we do it. Y'all ready?</i>

52:08.893 --> 52:13.530
It's all about Unity in the Community!
Yo, Monte Vista, let's go!

52:13.531 --> 52:15.899
We got The Rej3ctz in the house!

52:48.631 --> 52:51.668
Oh, snap! The Rangers
are in the house!

52:51.669 --> 52:54.469
They're the favorites to win
the contest tonight, y'all.

53:01.077 --> 53:04.212
You Ranger boys better
behave yourselves tonight.

53:06.849 --> 53:08.952
I'm gonna behave on
that ass tonight.

53:08.953 --> 53:11.352
Yeah, Ms. Johnson got cakes.

53:12.322 --> 53:14.090
I ain't gonna lie.
She is nice looking.

53:14.091 --> 53:16.225
Come on, man.

53:16.226 --> 53:19.526
What you're really supposed to be
worried about is Anastacia tonight.

53:21.230 --> 53:24.667
Nigga, this ain't the Disney Channel.
You better go handle that.

53:24.668 --> 53:26.736
She practically throwing her
pussy at you, fuck boy.

53:26.737 --> 53:28.957
All you got to do is catch it.

53:30.239 --> 53:31.841
I don't even know
what to do, y'all.

53:31.842 --> 53:33.643
I know what this
little nigga needs.

53:33.644 --> 53:35.584
Seven minutes of heaven.

53:38.648 --> 53:39.983
Hey!

53:39.984 --> 53:42.185
Everybody got their
name in the hat?

53:42.186 --> 53:45.054
For sure. Y'all know
how this goes down.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.123
Seven minutes of heaven.

53:47.124 --> 53:49.025
I pick two names out of this cap,

53:49.026 --> 53:51.886
y'all go into this closet
right here for seven minutes.

53:52.662 --> 53:54.596
First two names are...

53:56.934 --> 53:58.634
Julian and Big Booty Becky.

53:59.102 --> 54:00.835
Get in.

54:01.671 --> 54:03.072
What a nasty ho!

54:04.308 --> 54:05.874
Seven minutes.

54:06.676 --> 54:08.476
So, what's up, Becky?

54:09.045 --> 54:10.913
Absolutely nothing.

54:10.914 --> 54:13.082
For seven minutes.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.823
Come on, don't be like that.

54:15.418 --> 54:17.252
Ow.

54:21.392 --> 54:23.826
Doesn't this just get
your adrenaline going?

54:23.827 --> 54:26.896
It's like a dominatrix has
your balls in a vice grip!

54:26.897 --> 54:31.134
This is what super cops
do, right, Lagney?

54:31.135 --> 54:32.769
What the fuck are you doing?

54:32.770 --> 54:35.271
- I've had three of these things...
- Shit.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.873
The best.

54:36.874 --> 54:39.676
What happens when you
lick a goat's ass?

54:39.677 --> 54:42.311
Ah...

54:42.312 --> 54:44.452
<i>Pay attention, fucker!</i>

54:51.087 --> 54:53.322
- I think you're beautiful.
- What?

54:53.323 --> 54:54.904
I think you're beautiful.

54:56.859 --> 54:58.795
You're beautiful.

54:58.796 --> 55:01.064
Get your hand off my
tit, man! I'm driving.

55:01.065 --> 55:03.565
I like you.

55:06.969 --> 55:08.304
So we not gonna do nothing, Becky?

55:08.305 --> 55:11.340
Would you even be interested if I
didn't have this big ol' booty on me?

55:11.341 --> 55:13.910
What? What kind of
question is that?

55:13.911 --> 55:17.180
That's what I thought. All
you like me for is my booty.

55:17.181 --> 55:19.614
It's such a nice booty.

55:21.017 --> 55:24.320
Plus, you got a cute smile.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.956
And a dimple that only
comes out when you laugh.

55:26.957 --> 55:28.157
Aw.

55:28.158 --> 55:30.793
See, I'm a nice guy.

55:30.794 --> 55:32.028
One minute left!

55:32.029 --> 55:33.930
Shit, that's all I need.

55:33.931 --> 55:35.930
You don't got to tell me twice.

55:37.834 --> 55:39.202
Daddy about to get it on.

55:40.404 --> 55:42.371
Fuck!

55:42.372 --> 55:43.840
You love the white chocolate.

55:43.841 --> 55:46.909
I normally don't date white
women. But when I do...

55:48.879 --> 55:50.513
What are y'all doing out in this
hallway? Get to the dance!

55:50.514 --> 55:53.816
The question is, sir, what
are you doing out here?

55:53.817 --> 55:57.019
Well, I'm the Principal.
What are you doing...

55:57.020 --> 56:01.157
Do you got an ETA on The New Boyz?

56:01.158 --> 56:04.460
No, but we know about
Ms. Johnson's T n' A.

56:04.461 --> 56:06.896
You better watch your mouth.

56:06.897 --> 56:09.866
Sitting up there talking about you know
something about Ms. Johnson's DNA...

56:09.867 --> 56:12.001
Yo, what the hell is
going on out there?

56:12.002 --> 56:16.038
Uh, Principal Rogers, as soon
as I hear about The New Boyz,

56:16.039 --> 56:17.940
I'll come look for you, bro.

56:17.941 --> 56:20.076
Yeah, you do that.

56:20.077 --> 56:22.445
Snitchin' ass nigga. You know
a snitch don't like a snitch.

56:22.446 --> 56:25.446
You take it easy and get
to the dance, nigga.

56:26.382 --> 56:27.982
Will do, sir.

56:34.123 --> 56:36.459
Hey, y'all give it up for
the Supa Sizers, y'all!

56:49.839 --> 56:51.406
Do the shit!

56:51.908 --> 56:53.441
Do the shit!

56:59.282 --> 57:01.184
Next two names are...

57:01.185 --> 57:05.520
Jason and Anastacia.

57:07.123 --> 57:12.295
Okay, I guess y'all are not
feeling the Supa Sizers.

57:12.296 --> 57:15.464
The New Boyz are on their way and we
still got the talent contest coming up.

57:15.465 --> 57:18.067
The Sweet Gyrls, The Rangers...

57:20.037 --> 57:22.036
Seven minutes.

57:29.478 --> 57:30.913
Have you done this before?

57:30.914 --> 57:32.982
Nope.

57:32.983 --> 57:35.583
Me either. Kinda awkward, huh?

57:36.085 --> 57:38.419
Yeah. Very.

57:44.360 --> 57:46.896
<i>Power 106!</i>

57:46.897 --> 57:48.965
<i>We are broadcasting live from
Monte Vista High School,</i>

57:48.966 --> 57:51.167
<i>it's all about Unity
in the Community.</i>

57:51.168 --> 57:54.136
<i>And we're waiting on The
New Boyz. Where y'all at, man?</i>

57:54.137 --> 57:56.804
- Hey, nigga. Wake the fuck up!
- Yeah, nigga.

57:57.540 --> 58:02.478
Man, fuck these niggas. Hurry up so we
can bash this thing at the lock-in.

58:02.479 --> 58:05.381
All right, that's my nigga.
Now we're talking.

58:08.051 --> 58:10.453
- Whee!
- What the fuck are you doing, man?

58:10.454 --> 58:12.889
Get your ass out of my face!

58:12.890 --> 58:14.323
Soft as a baby's butt!

58:14.324 --> 58:16.424
Are you fucking crazy?

58:17.426 --> 58:20.196
Normally we have these
missions more intact.

58:20.197 --> 58:22.999
But it seems that my partner has taken
some kind of controlled substance.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.067
I'm R. Kelly, bitch.

58:26.103 --> 58:27.236
Mmm...

58:27.237 --> 58:29.103
What the fuck are you doing?

58:29.672 --> 58:31.974
Are you nuts?

58:31.975 --> 58:36.512
Peaches! Bitch, bring your ass out
the house with my goddamn money.

58:36.513 --> 58:39.348
I'll blow every window in that
raggedy fuckin' condo out.

58:39.349 --> 58:41.816
What the fuck are you doing, man?

58:43.185 --> 58:45.554
Bring your ass out here!
I'm gonna kill you!

58:46.690 --> 58:48.189
Oh!

58:52.995 --> 58:55.231
One minute left!

58:55.232 --> 58:57.466
So... There's no
chance that I can...

58:57.467 --> 58:59.235
You're not getting my panties.

58:59.236 --> 59:00.303
What?

59:00.304 --> 59:01.971
I know all about it.

59:01.972 --> 59:07.243
Julian told Becky, who told Jasmine,
who told me all about your mission.

59:07.244 --> 59:08.444
Kinda stupid, huh?

59:08.445 --> 59:10.513
Yeah.

59:10.514 --> 59:12.613
And I can't go out like that.

59:13.115 --> 59:14.717
I understand.

59:14.718 --> 59:17.852
And honestly, I respect
you more for it.

59:18.454 --> 59:20.356
Thanks.

59:20.357 --> 59:21.958
You're sweet.

59:21.959 --> 59:23.591
Doing good, cowboy.

I like how you love me ♪</i>

01:09:54.656 --> 01:09:55.657

I fucks with The Rangers!

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.941
Oh, my God! You were amazing!

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:16.078
Yo, J-Extra. You saved us, dawg!

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:18.113
You did that, my dude. Respect!

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:20.349
Yo, Jay, where did that come from?

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:23.018
I honestly couldn't even tell
you, it just, like, came to me.

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:26.254
- Yo. You see this right here, right?
- Got someone who need that.

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:29.758
You know what I'm saying? Somebody's
about to walk away with $2,000.

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:33.996
You know what I'm saying? DJ Felli Fel,
Power 106, Unity in the Community.

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:37.332
It's been a great night. And to
announce your winner right now,

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.835
y'all give it up for The New Boyz!

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:53.315
Yo, this was a dope-ass
night of performances.

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:57.052
Hell yeah. Some of y'all did
your thing tonight, man!

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:59.421
Some of y'all were
complete failures.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.889
Fucking booty.

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:05.827
But yo, man, on the real though,
there can only be one winner.

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:08.797
And this group crushed it!
Murdered it! Killed it.

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:12.267
So, give it up for
tonight's winner!

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.036
Motherfucking...

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:15.671
Sweet Gyrls!

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.840
Huh?

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:20.676
- We won!
- This is so exciting!

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:22.077
- Thank you!
- My goodness!

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:23.979
Tell me that shit did
not just happen, bro.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.681
Yo, I needed that two grand.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.182
How did we lose?

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:31.186
- We must've got these niggas tripping, bro!
- Yo, look at how high they are.

01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:32.754
Don't even know who the fuck
they're picking right now.

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.156
So excited!

01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:37.726
Oh shit! Day Day, it's 12:00.

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:39.928
Time for me to go face
the music, you feel me?

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:41.363
Wait. Hold up. What's 12:00?

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:44.565
Yo. That's the end of
the talent show, y'all.

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:54.309
Day Day, I know you don't want to
get into it with the Ese's, man.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.778
Shit!

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:59.414
Yo Junior, I tried to get your money by
midnight. But I need some more time.

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.016
You can do whatever you want to me.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.878
But please, don't hurt my family.

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.090
I ain't got insurance, Junior!

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:14.863
Junior says, "Time's up!"

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:17.332
Man, Day Day ain't going nowhere.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.499
You're going to have
to kill us all.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.373
Cool.

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:27.409
No. Fuck that. It's cool, bro.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:31.279
It's time for me to handle this debt
by myself. Like a man. So what's up?

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.482
- What's up?
- Junior!

01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:35.784
Flaco, no!

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:38.186
Anastacia, what are you doing here?
Get outta here, go!

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:40.848
Anastacia, go back to the gym.
We good, I promise.

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:48.196
Don't talk to my
sister like that, <i>ese.</i>

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.696
Stop it!

01:12:51.299 --> 01:12:54.402
We'll blast through Mexicans tonight
for what they did to you, OG.

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:56.772
Man, fuck that nigga, Junior, cuz!

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.141
What?

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:01.376
Nigga what?

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:06.307
Oh, we could've made some Mexican
cunt salad around this motherfucker.

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:25.433
Now is the time, my son!

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.734
This is your hero moment!

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:52.060
Oh!

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:55.362
I'm fine!

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.031
Are you okay?

01:13:59.167 --> 01:14:01.435
Oh, my God, Jason. You're hurt.

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.616
Everybody, freeze!

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:16.618
- What the hell is going on here?
- Yeah!

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:18.119
Stand back! We got this.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.889
Everybody freeze!

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.091
We got this. We got
this under control!

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:25.692
Great frickin' police work.

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:30.465
Can I just talk to
him for one second.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.006
You got one minute, then we need to get
him to the hospital to get sewn up.

01:14:34.135 --> 01:14:36.972
Look. I'm sorry all this happened.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:40.774
This whole money thing with Day Day and
your brother got way out of hand. And...

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.977
Playa, playa!

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:50.751
Day Day.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.721
Appreciate your little
homie saving my sister.

01:14:56.224 --> 01:14:58.558
You still owe Junior $2,000.

01:15:04.099 --> 01:15:05.699
This ain't over.

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:12.172
- What're you doing? That's your prize money.
- It's fine!

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.556
Jason told me to give this to you.

01:15:17.512 --> 01:15:19.446
And he got the drawers, too.

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:22.651
I'll take that.

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:24.651
And I will take that!

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:29.557
Hey Jay, I appreciate the
way you came through, bro!

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:32.327
That was some true
Ranger fashion. Salute.

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:35.563
I told you, man. We family, and
I consider y'all my friends.

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:39.067
Straight up, bro. You my friend.
And official Ranger member.

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:41.002
You deserve it!

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:44.406
Man, I'm just grateful y'all helped me find
the confidence to get the girl of my dreams.

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:45.607
Ow!

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:51.379
Now, I'm going to the
hospital with my boyfriend.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.982
Boyfriend? Papa ain't
gonna like that.

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:58.151
Oh, yeah? Well, he's just going to
have to deal with it! And so are you!

01:15:58.653 --> 01:16:00.187
Uh-oh.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:08.530
We gonna keep your
ass in our prayers.

01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:10.999
Man, I wish I would've got shot.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.301
What is you talking about?

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.136
Do you know how much ass I would've
gotten on Monday, if I got shot?

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:17.037
- Wow!
- God, man!

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:23.645
<i>You see, that's how
it really went down.</i>

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:27.082
<i>Fairytale endings do really
happen, even in the hood.</i>

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:30.517
<i>Now all I need is a painless
circumcision and I'll be straight.</i>

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.857
Who shot my baby?

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.260
Who shot my baby?

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:44.132
Everybody scatter! Everybody could
get some of this lead tonight!

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:47.102
Fucking Kardashian
cheerleader bitches!

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:51.072
You fucking Rangers. I'll fuck 'em
and I'll kill you motherfuckers.

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:54.709
God damn it, everybody. You fucking
writers. You raggedy-ass producers.

01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:00.582
All you bitches! Everybody
out there in the theater.

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:05.086
All you motherfucking Slurpee-serving,
popcorn-buttering motherfuckers!

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:08.156
And you bitches. I tell you, you
better not be bootlegging my shit.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:11.292
You better not bootleg this shit.
I'll come out there and I'll get you.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:14.662
It's like in a Freddy Krueger movie.
I'll be back and get you in the sequel.

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:18.598
Motherfuckers! Deuce it!
You heard? What?

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:55.908
What the fuck going on
with the beats, y'all?

01:19:56.357 --> 01:19:58.526
Hey nigga, fuck!

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:01.396
Shit's speedin' up. Shit, nigga!

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:04.097
I can't dance to this shit,
nigga! Shit, nigga!

01:20:06.834 --> 01:20:10.638
Nigga, oh shit! I can't
catch my breath, nigga.

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.473
Oh shit, nigga. I hate this shit!

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:22.148
Bounce, nigga, bounce!

01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:23.985
Bounce, bounce nigga!

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:25.853
Come on!

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:27.488
Fuck that shit, nigga!

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.692
Don't hate, participate.

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:32.927
Fuck that, nigga. I'm tired
of this bitch, nigga!

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.440
Oh, shit!

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:54.040
Nigga, I'm sweatin' all
around my second belly there.

01:21:00.256 --> 01:21:01.689
Can this be a movie?

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.591
Like is this going
to be in the movies?

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:04.892
'Cause I can act.

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.394
Where are we starting?

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:07.462
From the top again, right?

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:09.462
What up, pretty bitches?

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.379
I got pussy hair tougher than you.

01:21:14.702 --> 01:21:17.405
I fucked up on that.

01:21:17.406 --> 01:21:20.106
- Fuckers!
- I'd like to fuck you, Chris Paul.

01:21:21.442 --> 01:21:24.412
And if you look into the mirror,
you gonna think you look like

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:26.633
the little nigga on <i>The
Lord of the Rings.</i>

01:21:26.981 --> 01:21:29.783
Give me the ring, Percy.

01:21:30.351 --> 01:21:32.387
Get ready tonight, baby.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:34.956
'Cause I'm gonna stick
this rat-tail up your ass.

01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:38.059
And I like a woman that's
built like a mattress.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.927
I'm gonna lay on you later.

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:41.696
I will.

01:21:41.697 --> 01:21:43.765
Gonna stick my face in your ass.

01:21:43.766 --> 01:21:45.965
With an antibiotic in my mouth.

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:48.303
Y'all better not move.

01:21:48.304 --> 01:21:49.771
Y'all better not move.

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:52.006
Dude with no shirt on,
with hard nipples.

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.808
And you're touching them.

01:21:53.809 --> 01:21:55.777
A seven for your ass!

01:21:55.778 --> 01:21:58.579
You ain't got bitch.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.881
That bitch look good, though.

01:21:59.882 --> 01:22:01.382
You got it.

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.318
She look good.

01:22:03.319 --> 01:22:04.519
Yeah.

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:08.623
Give mamma a kiss before you go.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:48.595
Whoo-hoo!

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.111
You know what, while
I interrupt your...

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:04.911
Oh.

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:07.615
Wait, wait. I forgot my lines.

01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:10.885
Just help me. I only
got one sphincter.

01:23:10.886 --> 01:23:12.754
You gonna wreck the whole jail down

01:23:12.755 --> 01:23:15.490
with your strong self.
I got delicate ankles.

01:23:18.861 --> 01:23:20.395
Who you asking for?

01:23:20.396 --> 01:23:21.662
Another homie.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:22.864
All right, homie. Yeah!

01:23:22.865 --> 01:23:24.732
Clap on, clap off, nigga.

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.634
You dead, bitch! You want it?

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:30.905
Don't move. I got it. You ready?

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:32.807
Nigga, you about to be dead, nigga!

01:23:34.543 --> 01:23:36.144
- OG Lil' Pretty Thug.
- Excuse me, say what?

01:23:36.145 --> 01:23:37.578
Nigga, I'm saying my name.

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:39.545
OG Lil' Pretty Thug.

01:23:42.084 --> 01:23:43.084
Light's out, nigga. You hear me?

01:23:43.085 --> 01:23:44.519
Okay.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.454
Light's out for you, nigga.

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:52.493
- That shit's gotta be edited.
- Fuck. My bad.

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:53.528
I'm sorry. Was that
my line, or his line?

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.029
- What?
- I messed up.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.465
- Am I supposed to say my line?
- Mmm, yeah.

01:23:57.466 --> 01:23:59.033
- Shit. Line?
- Wait. What is it?

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:01.569
Sorry.

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:04.939
So, I hear you need one more volunteer
teacher tonight. For the lock-out.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.674
You heard right.

01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:09.577
One more time, please. "Lock-in."

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:12.847
So, I hear you need one more
teacher for the volunteer tonight.

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.851
So, I hear you need one
more teacher tonight.

01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:19.018
Volunteer for the line...

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:24.459
One more volunteer teacher for the lock-in.
You can keep doing it a hundred times.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.160
I'm sweating!

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:28.341
What the fuck were
they talking about?
