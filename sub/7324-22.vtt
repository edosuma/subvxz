15:52.722 --> 15:54.624
I FIGURED I'D TRY
THE NONTRADITIONAL ROUTE.

15:54.624 --> 15:56.226
IT HELPED.
OH.

15:56.226 --> 15:57.527
IT DID.

15:57.527 --> 15:59.289
BUT THE PAIN STARTED
TO KICK UP,

15:59.289 --> 16:01.731
SO I SAW A REAL DOCTOR.

16:01.731 --> 16:03.733
AND HE WAS GONNA SEND ME
TO AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON,

16:03.733 --> 16:05.965
BUT THEN I WAS LIKE,
"HOLD UP.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.238
YUMA ROBBINS JUST MARRIED
ONE OF THOSE."

16:08.238 --> 16:09.439
NOT THAT IT WAS
A REAL WEDDING.

16:09.439 --> 16:11.071
(laughs)
(elevator bell dings)

16:11.071 --> 16:12.542
EXCUSE ME?

16:12.542 --> 16:14.244
OH, UM, SHE THINKS
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

16:14.244 --> 16:17.207
OH, I AM SERIOUS.
TUCSON'S ALREADY MARRIED.

16:17.207 --> 16:18.408
MM-HMM. TO HIM.

16:18.408 --> 16:19.579
SHE LOVES ME.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.111
WE WERE 10,
IT WAS IN MY TREE HOUSE,

16:21.111 --> 16:23.653
AND WE HAD RINGS
MADE OF CRABGRASS.

16:23.653 --> 16:25.155
YOU'RE PROBABLY THE LAST GUY
I EVER KISSED.

16:25.155 --> 16:28.658
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY.
TIM OFFICIATED, HER BROTHER.

16:28.658 --> 16:30.120
MM-HMM.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.062
HE MADE ME SWEAR TO STOP PULLING
THE STREAMERS OFF OF HER BIKE.

16:32.062 --> 16:33.223
MM. (chuckles)

16:33.223 --> 16:34.624
IT WAS AN ISSUE
FOR A WHILE.

16:34.624 --> 16:36.626
YEAH, I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED
ABOUT HOW MUCH PAIN YOU'RE IN.

16:36.626 --> 16:39.169
SO I AM GOING TO ORDER
SOME NEW SCANS.

16:39.169 --> 16:40.600
THESE ARE HOW OLD?

16:40.600 --> 16:43.173
9, YOU KNOW, MAYBE 12 MONTHS.
I HAD TO FINISH UP A PROJECT

16:43.173 --> 16:44.774
ON THE GUYS WHO CARRY
ALL THE TOURISTS' CRAP UP K-2.

16:44.774 --> 16:46.136
WITH A CANE?

16:46.136 --> 16:47.277
I STAYED AT BASE CAMP.

16:47.277 --> 16:48.778
PLAY THROUGH THE PAIN,
RIGHT?

16:48.778 --> 16:51.041
NO.
ANYBODY?

16:51.041 --> 16:52.742
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

16:52.742 --> 16:54.514
IS SHE ALWAYS LIKE THAT
OR AM I DYING?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.786
NO, YOU ARE
GOING TO BE FINE,

16:56.786 --> 16:59.189
BECAUSE SHE IS A GENIUS
WITH A SCALPEL.

16:59.189 --> 17:00.690
SHE'LL BE IN AND OUT,
AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.422
AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA USE DRUGS.
OH.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.524
NOPE, NOPE, JUST, UM,
CHAMOMILE TEA.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.726
(chuckles)
YOU ARE SO DAMN CUTE.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.198
HOW DOES SHE GET THROUGH
A WORK DAY WITH YOU AROUND?

17:08.198 --> 17:09.559
(laughs) I DON'T KNOW.

17:09.559 --> 17:11.201
(chuckles)

17:13.203 --> 17:14.504
I FORGOT HOW MUCH
I MISSED YOU.

17:14.504 --> 17:16.436
ME, TOO.

17:19.169 --> 17:21.341
(sighs)

17:21.341 --> 17:24.043
AND OUR SURGICAL ROTATIONS
OFTEN ALLOW

17:24.043 --> 17:27.117
FLEXIBILITY TO SET ASIDE
CONSECUTIVE DAYS

17:27.117 --> 17:30.220
FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS
AND FIELD WORK IF NECESSARY.

17:30.220 --> 17:31.251
ANY QUESTIONS?

17:31.251 --> 17:33.253
WOULD I HAVE TO SHARE
AN OFFICE?

17:33.253 --> 17:34.584
WE DON'T H--

17:34.584 --> 17:37.527
I'LL HAVE TO CHECK
ON THAT.

17:37.527 --> 17:39.459
ARE PARKING SPACES ASSIGNED
FOR ATTENDINGS,

17:39.459 --> 17:41.731
OR DO WE HAVE TO, LIKE,
FIND OUR OWN?

17:41.731 --> 17:43.233
I'LL HAVE TO CHECK ON THAT.

17:43.233 --> 17:44.534

17:47.767 --> 17:50.770

17:53.773 --> 17:55.845
ALL RIGHT, WE JUST NEED
TO SCREW THIS DOWN

17:55.845 --> 17:59.209
AND THEN ADJUST IT
TO FIT.

17:59.209 --> 18:00.550
WELL...

18:00.550 --> 18:03.853
MARK SAID THAT I GET TO GRAFT
THE FAT.

18:03.853 --> 18:05.385
HOW COOL IS THAT?

18:05.385 --> 18:07.157
YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

18:07.157 --> 18:08.618

18:08.618 --> 18:11.361

18:19.529 --> 18:21.571

18:21.571 --> 18:23.873
WH-WHAT DID HE SAY?
(stammers) HOW DID IT GO DOWN?

18:23.873 --> 18:26.206

18:26.206 --> 18:27.837
I GOTTA GO
CHECK ON A PATIENT.

18:27.837 --> 18:29.379
NO, I--OH, DOES HE WANT
TO DO IT?

18:29.379 --> 18:30.680
I MEAN, DID IT SEEM LIKE
HE WAS EXCITED ABOUT IT?

18:30.680 --> 18:33.213
OR DOES HE SEEM LIKE,
"THAT'S AN INSANE IDEA"?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.644
BECAUSE IT IS.
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I...

18:34.644 --> 18:39.349
D--I HOPE YOU TOLD HIM
THAT IT'S AN INSANE... IDEA.

18:39.349 --> 18:40.550
(scoffs)

18:40.550 --> 18:41.721
(door closes)

18:41.721 --> 18:43.853

18:43.853 --> 18:46.426

WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GROSS?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.258
UH, THEY KEEP ASKING ME
ABOUT BOWELS

18:48.258 --> 18:49.759

18:49.759 --> 18:51.831
IT'S GENERAL SURGERY.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.833
YOU'RE NOT HELPING,
AT ALL.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.766
MY GUY IS A FREAKIN' FOSSIL.

18:56.766 --> 18:58.638
THE LAST TIME
HE WAS IN THE O.R.,

18:58.638 --> 19:00.370
IT WAS LIT BY CANDLES.

19:00.370 --> 19:03.413
MAYBE I'LL JUST LIVE IN HERE,
IN THIS STALL,

19:03.413 --> 19:05.175
IN MY FILTH...

19:05.175 --> 19:07.177
TILL I DIE.

19:07.177 --> 19:08.348
(knock on door)

19:08.348 --> 19:09.919
SICK WOMAN IN HERE.
GO AWAY.

19:09.919 --> 19:11.321
UH, I-I REALLY NEED
TO GET IN THERE.

19:11.321 --> 19:13.453
UH, SORRY.
CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.225
PLEASE LET ME IN.

THE ADVICE COLUMNIST?

19:29.939 --> 19:31.801
TOUCHY, TOUCHY.
WELL, I'M SORRY.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.403
IT'S JUST, NO ONE CAN SEEM TO
MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND TODAY.

19:33.403 --> 19:35.205
OH, PEOPLE DO MAKE UP
THEIR OWN MINDS,

GETTING THERE.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.608
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:38.608 --> 19:40.510
OKAY, IF SOMEONE COMES TO ME
WITH A PROBLEM...

19:40.510 --> 19:42.482
YEAH.
I GIVE THEM A METAPHOR.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.483
A METAPHOR?

19:43.483 --> 19:44.654
A FIGURE OF SPEECH WHICH--

19:44.654 --> 19:45.815
YES, I KNOW
WHAT A METAPHOR IS.

19:45.815 --> 19:47.387
FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.688
NOW THE NEXT TIME SOMEONE
COMES TO YOU WITH A PROBLEM,

19:48.688 --> 19:50.360
YOU JUST GIVE THEM
A METAPHOR.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.491
ANY KIND OF METAPHOR?

19:51.491 --> 19:52.662
SEE? THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF IT.

19:52.662 --> 19:54.494
THEY'LL DRAW
SOME MEANING FROM IT,

19:54.494 --> 19:56.496
AND IT'LL HELP THEM
MAKE THE DECISION

19:56.496 --> 19:58.197

19:58.197 --> 19:59.499

THANK YOU.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.602

THEY TAKE YOUR ADVICE

20:02.602 --> 20:04.304

IS A TOTAL FIASCO.

20:38.708 --> 20:40.270

REEL IT IN.

20:41.371 --> 20:44.544
AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO HIM
A-AND I NEED HIM.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.946
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN CALM ME DOWN!

20:46.946 --> 20:49.449
WHY THE HELL DID YOU DO IT?
WHY'D YOU LET ME?
I DON'T KNOW!

20:49.449 --> 20:50.450

I KNOW!

20:50.450 --> 20:51.781

ALL MESSED UP NOW, TOO.

20:56.726 --> 20:58.488
I'M--I'M NOW THE GUY THAT MADE
YOU BREAK YOUR PROMISE TO JESUS?

20:58.488 --> 21:00.590

ALL RIGHT?

DESTROYING MY APPETITE.

23:52.462 --> 23:54.433
YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD'VE SAID THIS,

23:54.433 --> 23:56.966
BUT WE NEED TO KEEP
OUR PEOPLE, PEOPLE.

23:56.966 --> 23:58.107
MM-HMM.
(Teddy) RIGHT?

23:58.107 --> 23:59.939
WE HAVEN'T PUT IN
ALL THIS TRAINING

23:59.939 --> 24:01.641
AND PUT UP WITH
ALL THEIR NONSENSE

24:01.641 --> 24:03.112
TO GO GROVELING AT THE FEET
OF BREAD SNIFFERS.

24:03.112 --> 24:04.814
KEPNER'S ALREADY GOTTEN
JOB OFFERS

24:04.814 --> 24:05.875
AT FOUR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.046
OH.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.478
WELL,
GREY'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

24:08.478 --> 24:10.480
NOT WITHOUT YANG ANYWAY.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.652
CRISTINA HAS OPTIONS.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.924
MY CONTACT IN BOSTON

24:14.924 --> 24:17.887
MAY HAVE MENTIONED
THAT MEREDITH SAID

24:17.887 --> 24:19.929
THEIR PROGRAM'S
HER FIRST CHOICE.

24:19.929 --> 24:21.891
YOU'RE BUILDING A HOUSE.

24:21.891 --> 24:24.764
HARVARD HAS AN EXCELLENT
NEUROSURGERY DEPARTMENT.

24:24.764 --> 24:25.935
W--

24:25.935 --> 24:28.067
AND THEY HAVE PLENTY
OF REALLY NICE HOUSES.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.801
DON'T BE ALL CRYPTIC
AND THEN JUST WALK AWAY.

24:31.801 --> 24:32.872
(chuckles)

24:32.872 --> 24:34.974
(Derek) MEREDITH?

24:34.974 --> 24:36.646
(Meredith)
Uh, I lied to you.

24:36.646 --> 24:38.077
ABOUT WHAT?

24:38.077 --> 24:39.779
I'M NOT OKAY.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.981
I MIGHT BE DYING. I THINK
OUR DAUGHTER TRIED TO KILL ME

24:41.981 --> 24:43.653
with her flu
for being a bad mother.

24:43.653 --> 24:44.984
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME BEFORE?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.215
I'm failing, Derek,

24:46.215 --> 24:48.087
and I--and I-I don't think
I can go back in there.

24:48.087 --> 24:51.260
I JUST CAN'T...
I MEAN...

24:51.260 --> 24:52.722
(blows air)

24:52.722 --> 24:55.024
WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME
IF I FAIL?

24:55.024 --> 24:58.027
YOU WANT ME TO YELL AT YOU
OR TELL YOU TO COME HOME?

24:58.027 --> 24:59.699
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.672
(sighs)

25:02.672 --> 25:04.003
THE TEST IS A MIRROR.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.504
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.677
THE TEST...
IT'S A MIRROR.

25:07.677 --> 25:11.510
REFLECTING
MY SICKLY INCOMPETENCE?

25:11.510 --> 25:12.982
(sighs)

25:12.982 --> 25:14.814
(sniffles)

25:14.814 --> 25:16.245
ARE YOU SAYING
I WON'T LIKE MYSELF

25:16.245 --> 25:17.917
IF I GIVE UP RIGHT NOW,

25:17.917 --> 25:20.019
THAT I WON'T BE ABLE
TO LOOK MYSELF IN THE MIRROR

25:20.019 --> 25:21.090
IF I QUIT?

25:21.090 --> 25:25.625
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE,
I WILL STILL LOVE YOU.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.797
NO, YOU WON'T.
NOBODY LOVES A QUITTER.

25:27.797 --> 25:29.559
GOOD LUCK, MEREDITH.

25:31.901 --> 25:33.563
(cell phone beeps)

25:33.563 --> 25:34.804
(sighs)

25:35.935 --> 25:37.036
(people speaking indistinctly)

25:37.036 --> 25:38.137
HUH.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.072
(woman)
YOU FIND OUT THE PATIENT

25:43.072 --> 25:45.114
HAS ADVANCED METASTATIC DISEASE
AND IS TERMINAL.

25:45.114 --> 25:46.245
WHAT DO YOU DO?

25:49.078 --> 25:51.050
HONESTLY?

25:51.050 --> 25:52.321
I'D PRAY FOR THEM.

25:52.321 --> 25:55.184
I KNOW THAT'S NOT
THE RIGHT ANSWER,

25:55.184 --> 25:57.026
BUT IT'S WHAT I'D DO FIRST.

25:57.026 --> 25:58.327
OR AT LEAST
IF YOU ASKED ME YESTERDAY,

25:58.327 --> 25:59.859
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.160
NOW I'M NOT SO SURE
IF HE'S LISTENING.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.693
DR. KEPNER, THIS IS
HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.

26:03.693 --> 26:04.964
YEAH, WELL, SO IS HAVING

26:04.964 --> 26:06.936
PREMARITAL SEX IN THE MEN'S ROOM
WITH A REALLY GOOD FRIEND,

26:06.936 --> 26:09.969
BUT THAT JUST HAPPENED,
SO... (chuckles)

26:11.701 --> 26:14.173
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN
SURROUNDED BY SCIENTISTS

26:14.173 --> 26:17.106
FOR A DECADE NOW,

26:17.106 --> 26:20.079
HOLDING BACK MY FEELINGS
ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD

26:20.079 --> 26:22.351
'CAUSE I WAS AFRAID
OF BEING LAUGHED AT

26:22.351 --> 26:26.656
OR JUDGED
OR CONSIDERED LESS OF A DOCTOR.

26:28.117 --> 26:30.960
I WAS HIDING,

26:30.960 --> 26:33.923
ASHAMED TO ADMIT
THAT I LOVE HIM,

26:33.923 --> 26:38.227
THAT HIS IS THE ONE RELATIONSHIP
I COUNT ON.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.971
(sighs) AND NOW--
NOW I'M NOT SURE

26:41.971 --> 26:43.673
IF I JUST SCREWED THAT UP

26:43.673 --> 26:46.105
OR FREED MYSELF
FROM ITS LIMITATIONS.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.878
I...

26:48.878 --> 26:52.081
THE ONE THING I KNOW
FOR SURE, THOUGH, IS...

26:52.081 --> 26:54.383
I THINK I'M DONE HIDING.

26:54.383 --> 26:56.015
DR. KEPNER,

26:56.015 --> 26:59.248
WE ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

26:59.248 --> 27:03.192
YES, I WOULD DO A PALLIATIVE
ENDOSCOPIC STENTING.

27:03.192 --> 27:05.825
IF THAT FAILED AND THE PATIENT
WAS STILL ALIVE AND HAVING PAIN,

27:05.825 --> 27:07.757
I WOULD DO
A BILIARY-ENTERIC BYPASS.

27:07.757 --> 27:09.058
AFTER THAT, I MIGHT...

27:09.058 --> 27:10.760
A 30-YEAR-OLD FEMALE COMES IN
WITH THIRD-DEGREE BURNS.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.863
YOU'VE CHECKED HER AIRWAY
AND STARTED FLUID RESUSCITATION

27:13.863 --> 27:15.805
WITH D-5 N.S. FLUIDS.

27:15.805 --> 27:18.668
ACTUALLY, I WOULD USE L.R.
FOR FLUID RESUSCITATION,

27:18.668 --> 27:20.169
NOT N.S.

27:20.169 --> 27:21.671
UH, SALINE
HAS TOO MUCH CHLORIDE,

27:21.671 --> 27:24.013
AND THAT COULD CAUSE ACIDOSIS
IN MY PATIENT.

27:24.013 --> 27:25.174
(car horns honk)

27:25.174 --> 27:26.676
OKAY.

27:26.676 --> 27:30.649
SO YOU'VE STARTED YOUR PATIENT
ON A LITER OF L.R.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.181
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:32.181 --> 27:34.123
(Callie)
THANKS FOR ASSISTING, BAILEY.

27:34.123 --> 27:35.084
YOU KNOW, NICK DID

27:35.084 --> 27:38.057
A BIG SPREAD
IN "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC" ONCE

27:38.057 --> 27:39.729
ON THIS SCHOOL
FOR ORPHAN GIRLS IN CALCUTTA,

27:39.729 --> 27:41.330
AND HE--HE SENT THEM
A BUNCH OF CAMERAS.

27:41.330 --> 27:43.232
I THINK THAT IT WAS POLAROIDS

27:43.232 --> 27:45.735
SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY
FOR THE FILM TO GET PROCESSED...
(exhales)

27:45.735 --> 27:47.036
BUT ANYWAYS, YOU KNOW,
A COUPLE OF THOSE GIRLS

27:47.036 --> 27:48.938
ACTUALLY
BECAME PHOTOGRAPHERS.

27:48.938 --> 27:51.100
LIKE PROFESSIONALS.
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

27:51.100 --> 27:53.172
WE'RE NOT GOING TO KILL
YOUR FRIEND.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.175
WHAT? I KNOW.
I'M JUST--I'M SAYING...

27:56.175 --> 27:58.677
HEY, DOES HE
SAVE PUPPIES, TOO?

27:58.677 --> 28:01.080
LESS SARCASM.
A LITTLE MORE FOCUS.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.153
(suction gurgling)

28:04.153 --> 28:06.115
(beeping continues)

28:06.115 --> 28:07.386
OH, SHOOT.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.218
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO

28:09.218 --> 28:11.220
BRING SNACK TODAY
TO THE DAY CARE

28:11.220 --> 28:13.162
FOR ALL THE KIDS.
TODAY?

28:13.162 --> 28:14.824
YEAH, THAT MOM FROM PSYCH ASKED
IF WE WOULD SWITCH WITH HER,

28:14.824 --> 28:16.095
AND I SAID WE WOULD,
AND THEN I FORGOT.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.426
YOU NEED TO WRITE
THIS STUFF DOWN. I--

28:17.426 --> 28:19.328
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I AM SO SORRY.
I...

28:19.328 --> 28:21.270
SORRY.

28:21.270 --> 28:23.332
(beeping continues)

28:23.332 --> 28:25.204
(door slides open)

28:25.204 --> 28:27.436
YOU DIDN'T
FORGET SNACK TODAY, DID YOU?

28:27.436 --> 28:29.138
(sighs)

28:29.138 --> 28:32.181
NO, I'M SEEING METS
IN THE VESSELS. LOOK AT THIS.

28:32.181 --> 28:35.044
DAMN.
AND IF THEY'RE HERE...

28:35.044 --> 28:37.716
THEY'RE GONNA BE EVERYWHERE.

28:43.192 --> 28:44.754
(instrument whirs)

28:44.754 --> 28:46.495
(Derek) THE TEMPORALIS MUSCLE
IS ATROPHIED.

28:46.495 --> 28:48.958
ANY IDEA WHY, DR. GREY?

28:48.958 --> 28:50.029
UH, LACK OF USE?

28:50.029 --> 28:52.902
IT HAD NOWHERE TO ATTACH
SINCE THE BONE WAS GONE.

28:52.902 --> 28:54.363
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THIS MUSCLE.

28:54.363 --> 28:57.306
IT'S MISSED ITS CHANCE
TO ATTACH.

28:57.306 --> 29:00.139
WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE TEMPORALIS?

29:00.139 --> 29:03.442
TEACHABLE MOMENT, DR. SLOAN.
STAY OUT OF IT.

29:03.442 --> 29:07.176
ONCE YOU INJECT THE FAT
INTO CHARLIE'S TEMPLE,

29:07.176 --> 29:08.147
THE MUSCLE WILL--

29:08.147 --> 29:09.318
AGAIN WITH THE MUSCLE?

29:09.318 --> 29:11.821
YEAH,
THE ONCE HEALTHY MUSCLE

29:11.821 --> 29:14.183
WILL SLOWLY WITHER
TO NOTHING

29:14.183 --> 29:15.785
ALL ALONE,

29:15.785 --> 29:20.329
SURROUNDED BY A THICK LAYER
OF FAT.

29:20.329 --> 29:21.891
MM.

29:21.891 --> 29:24.363
VERY CRAFTY, DR. SHEPHERD.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.835
MESSAGE RECEIVED,

29:25.835 --> 29:28.197
LOUD AND CLEAR.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.471
THEY HAD SNACK.

29:32.471 --> 29:35.504
AND NOW I HAVE 2 POUNDS OF
STRAWBERRIES FOR NO REASON.

29:35.504 --> 29:37.376
(chuckles)

29:37.376 --> 29:39.208
WHY--WHY IS TEDDY HERE?

29:39.208 --> 29:40.349
(sighs) OH, HONEY.

29:40.349 --> 29:43.012
WE DID A PET-SCAN,
AND, UM...

29:43.012 --> 29:44.954
NICK HAS INTRADURAL METS.

29:44.954 --> 29:47.086
THEY'VE SPREAD INTO
HIS LYMPH NODES.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.859
THEY'VE EVEN GONE INTO
HIS HEART.

29:49.859 --> 29:52.391
(Teddy) HE HAS A CARDIAC TUMOR,
WHICH LOOKS LIKE

29:52.391 --> 29:55.164
IT MIGHT HAVE INVADED
INTO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE.

29:55.164 --> 29:56.926
(Miranda)
AT THIS POINT,

29:56.926 --> 30:00.169
THERE'S VERY LITTLE
THAT WE CAN DO.

30:13.042 --> 30:15.284
(sighs)

30:17.086 --> 30:19.849
I-I WOULD BE CONCERNED
ABOUT CROHN'S DISEASE

30:19.849 --> 30:22.451
BUT DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
COULD BE P.U.D.,

30:22.451 --> 30:25.254
ULCERATIVE COLITIS,
OR APPENDICITIS.

30:25.254 --> 30:26.825
(woman) DR. GREY?

30:28.197 --> 30:32.301
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T--

30:32.301 --> 30:33.432
(vomits and coughs)

30:33.432 --> 30:35.935
(groans)

30:35.935 --> 30:37.266
I'D LOCATE THE FISTULA
ENDOSCOPICALLY,

30:37.266 --> 30:38.837
THEN INJECT FIBRIN GLUE.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.139
WHAT ABOUT AN ABSCESS?

30:40.139 --> 30:42.311
WHAT ABOUT IT?

30:42.311 --> 30:45.044
WELL, APPARENTLY,
YOU HAVE RULED IT OUT.

30:45.044 --> 30:48.878
IT JUST FEELS A BIT...
CAVALIER, DOESN'T IT?

30:48.878 --> 30:50.219
IF YOU SAY SO.

30:50.219 --> 30:51.921
I'M HAVING
A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING

30:51.921 --> 30:55.054
WHY I WOULD OPEN HER UP WHEN I
COULD TREAT IT ENDOSCOPICALLY.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.625
PRECISELY MY QUESTION,
DR. YANG.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.487
I'VE TREATED THIS CONDITION
A DOZEN TIMES.

30:58.487 --> 31:01.190
AND I A THOUSAND TIMES.

31:04.533 --> 31:07.066
IF YOU WOULD RATHER
I OPEN HER UP

31:07.066 --> 31:08.437
AND DO TUBE DUODENOSTOMY,

31:08.437 --> 31:11.500
THAT'S... FINE, TOO.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.272
IT'S MORE INVASIVE,
BUT FINE.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.403
MM-HMM.

31:16.175 --> 31:19.508
(vomiting and coughing)

31:19.508 --> 31:21.280
(sighs)

31:21.280 --> 31:22.511
DR. GREY.

31:22.511 --> 31:25.084
DR. GREY, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO CALL THIS.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.186
(coughs)
YOU CAN TAKE THE EXAM
AGAIN NEXT YEAR.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.358
AND WE WON'T--WE WON'T
COUNT THIS AS A FAILURE

31:29.358 --> 31:31.060
SO PLEASE--

31:31.060 --> 31:32.561
OKAY, YOU'RE DOCTORS. YOU CAN'T
HANDLE A LITTLE VOMIT?

31:32.561 --> 31:34.223
DR. GREY, IT--
IT'S REALLY OKAY--

31:34.223 --> 31:36.125
I WOULD REPAIR IT
WITH AN ABDOMINAL APPROACH,

31:36.125 --> 31:38.197
REDUCE THE SIZE
OF THE HERNIA CONTENTS,

31:38.197 --> 31:40.369
EXCISE THE SAC,
CLOSE THE HIATUS,

31:40.369 --> 31:44.573
AND PERFORM A FLOPPY NISSEN
FOR ANTIREFLUX AND GASTROPEXY.

31:44.573 --> 31:46.235
BUT ASK ME SOMETHING ELSE,

31:46.235 --> 31:48.677
BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN THAT ANSWER
SINCE I WAS, LIKE 12 YEARS OLD.

31:48.677 --> 31:51.580
MY MOTHER PRACTICALLY INVENTED
THE FLOPPY NISSEN.

31:51.580 --> 31:54.643
SO KEEP THEM COMING,
BUT DON'T GO EASY ON ME.

31:54.643 --> 31:56.445
ALL RIGHT.
A 40-YEAR-OLD MAN PRESENTS

31:56.445 --> 31:59.048
WITH A SUSPICIOUS LESION
ON HIS LEFT TEMPORAL,

31:59.048 --> 32:02.651
SENT IN BY HIS IN--
(vomits and coughs)

32:02.651 --> 32:05.054
(trash can clanks)

32:05.054 --> 32:07.957
WHEW. PIGMENTED LESION?
(sniffles)

32:07.957 --> 32:10.359
(man) YOU SEEM AWFULLY SURE
OF YOURSELF.

32:10.359 --> 32:12.461
I'M SORRY.
IS THAT A QUESTION?

32:12.461 --> 32:13.662
DO YOU FEEL THREATENED?

32:13.662 --> 32:15.204
OH, HAVE WE MOVED ON
TO PSYCHOLOGY?

32:15.204 --> 32:17.306
I FIND
YOUR HOSTILITY CURIOUS.

32:17.306 --> 32:19.438
AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY
YOU THINK ME HOSTILE.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.140
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH MY APPROACH,

32:21.140 --> 32:23.342
I WISH YOU WOULD VOICE
YOUR ISSUES.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.214
I-I DON'T DISAGREE.

32:25.214 --> 32:26.645
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.418
ARE YOU CALLING ME
A LIAR, SIR?

32:35.454 --> 32:37.226
FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:37.226 --> 32:40.189
EARLIER WHEN I SAID I WAS OKAY
WITH THAT OPEN PROCEDURE,

32:40.189 --> 32:41.490
I WASN'T.

32:41.490 --> 32:43.432
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OKAY
WHEN, LIKE,

32:43.432 --> 32:45.064
HAWKEYE AND B.J.
DID IT ON "M-A-S-H,"

32:45.064 --> 32:47.236
BUT THIS BEING
THE NEW CENTURY AND ALL,

32:47.236 --> 32:50.399
I WOULD HAVE, AS I SAID EARLIER,
TREATED IT ENDOSCOPICALLY.

32:50.399 --> 32:51.600
THEN YOU LIED EARLIER.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.971
YOU KNOW WHAT? OH, GOD.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.274
I CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
ANY WAY YOU WANT

32:55.274 --> 32:57.346
USING MEDICAL TECHNIQUES
FROM ANY ERA.

32:57.346 --> 32:58.647
SO HOW ABOUT WE JUST,

32:58.647 --> 33:00.749
YOU KNOW, PICK A DECADE
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH

33:00.749 --> 33:03.612
AND GO FROM THERE?

33:03.612 --> 33:05.354
WELL, THEN...

33:05.354 --> 33:08.757
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE
BEING WITNESS TO SUCH GENIUS.

33:08.757 --> 33:11.390
I CAN NOW FINALLY RETIRE

33:11.390 --> 33:14.093
KNOWING THAT SUCH ADVANCED
AND CREATIVE MINDS

33:14.093 --> 33:17.996
ARE AT WORK
IN THE SURGICAL FIELD, HMM?

33:17.996 --> 33:19.168
(papers rustle)

33:19.168 --> 33:20.729
(clears throat)
THAT'S IT?

33:20.729 --> 33:23.001
OH, I THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF AN EDUCATION TODAY,

33:23.001 --> 33:24.203
DR. YANG.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.374
(both click latches)

33:25.374 --> 33:27.736
BUT...
THERE'S STILL 20 MINUTES.

33:27.736 --> 33:30.339
NO NEED.

33:30.339 --> 33:32.181
OH...

33:32.181 --> 33:33.342
BEST OF LUCK.

33:33.342 --> 33:34.683
(pats shoulder)

33:36.245 --> 33:38.487
(door opens and closes)

33:38.487 --> 33:39.648
I'D DO A BIOPSY.

33:39.648 --> 33:41.320
(man) PATH SHOWS L.C.I.S.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.452
WHAT'S YOUR
BEST MASTECTOMY APPROACH?

33:43.452 --> 33:45.023
I'D MAKE A PERIAREOLAR INCISION

33:45.023 --> 33:47.656
TO PRESERVE
THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD.

33:47.656 --> 33:51.130
BUT WAIT.
DID YOU SAY L.C.I.S.?

33:51.130 --> 33:53.062
YES, LOBULAR CARCINOMA
IN SITU.

33:53.062 --> 33:56.335
YOU WOULDN'T DO A MASTECTOMY.
YOU'D OBSERVE AND REPEAT MAMMOS.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.607
YOU ALREADY DID
A SKIN SPARING MASTECTOMY.

33:58.607 --> 34:00.439
THAT WAS A TRICK QUESTION.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.040
YOU HAD ALL THE FACTS
TO ANSWER.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.472
YEAH, BUT MY ANSWER
WAS WRONG.

34:03.472 --> 34:06.175
I'M GONNA FAIL
BECAUSE OF A TRICK QUESTION?

34:06.175 --> 34:08.347
THE QUESTIONS ARE DESIGNED
TO GET YOUR RESPONSE--

34:08.347 --> 34:09.578
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME?

34:09.578 --> 34:11.280
YOU MISSED YOUR FIRST SESSION.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.781
YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE
EVEN GETTING THIS CHANCE.

34:12.781 --> 34:14.453
YEAH, I MISSED
MY FIRST SESSION

34:14.453 --> 34:15.724
FOR THE BEST FREAKIN' REASON.

34:15.724 --> 34:17.356
I WAS WITH A PATIENT.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.459
FOR MONTHS WITH THIS KID
WHO--WHO DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE,

34:20.459 --> 34:21.790
NOT A CHANCE.

34:21.790 --> 34:24.533
AND WE GIVE THEM A CHANCE
AND WE TRY EVERYTHING,

34:24.533 --> 34:26.335
AND THEN WHEN THERE'S
NOTHING LEFT TO DO,

34:26.335 --> 34:28.337
I'M SUPPOSED
TO JUST WALK AWAY

34:28.337 --> 34:30.269
FROM HIS MOTHER?

34:30.269 --> 34:33.242
I HAD TO BE THERE.
I HAD TO.

34:33.242 --> 34:34.373
AND WHAT--
WHAT DID I MISS HERE,

34:34.373 --> 34:37.506
A FEW MORE
HYPOTHETICAL TRICK QUESTIONS?

34:37.506 --> 34:39.348
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

34:39.348 --> 34:40.779
YOU GUYS ARE DOCTORS.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.452
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DECIDE
IF I'M GONNA BE A DOCTOR,

34:43.452 --> 34:45.254
AND YOU
CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT?

34:45.254 --> 34:46.315
THANK YOU, DR. KAREV.

34:46.315 --> 34:47.486
IT'S KAREV.

34:49.488 --> 34:52.491
CAN YOU AT LEAST TELL ME
IF I PASSED?

34:55.494 --> 34:57.566
(cart rattles,
door opens)

34:57.566 --> 34:59.398
(door closes)

35:00.799 --> 35:02.801
(grunts)
(bag clatters)

35:05.774 --> 35:07.436
(sighs)

35:18.817 --> 35:20.789
(ship's horn honks)

35:20.789 --> 35:22.151
THANK YOU.

35:22.151 --> 35:23.622
THANK YOU.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.123
(man) TAXI.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.126
(indistinct conversations)

35:29.898 --> 35:32.161
WELL, YOU--YOU DON'T WANT
TO MISS YOUR FLIGHT.

35:32.161 --> 35:34.233
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO MISS MY FLIGHT.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.834
I BETTER GO.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.207
MM.

35:38.207 --> 35:39.668
AHH.

35:39.668 --> 35:41.870
RICHARD, I DON'T REGRET
LAST NIGHT

35:41.870 --> 35:43.842
ONE BIT.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.675
NEITHER DO I.
(chuckles)

35:46.675 --> 35:48.617
IT'S JUST BAD TIMING.

35:48.617 --> 35:50.749
YOU KNOW, WE LIVE
IN DIFFERENT CITIES.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.222
IT'S--IT'S TOO COMPLICATED
RIGHT NOW.

35:53.222 --> 35:54.783
YEAH, BAD TIMING.

35:54.783 --> 35:56.555
(sighs) BYE, RICHARD.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.157
BYE, CATHERINE.
SAFE FLIGHT.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.460
OH, UH, CALL ME IF YOU HEAR
ANY MORE ABOUT THE BOARDS.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.392
OH, I WILL, AND CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET HOME,

36:03.392 --> 36:04.893
LET ME KNOW
YOU GOT THERE OKAY.

36:04.893 --> 36:05.894
I WILL.

36:05.894 --> 36:09.398
ARE... YOU GOING TO

36:09.398 --> 36:11.900
THE TRAUMA AND CRITICAL CARE
CONFERENCE IN MAY?

36:11.900 --> 36:14.303
IN NEW ORLEANS?

36:14.303 --> 36:15.444
I'M SPEAKING AT IT.

36:15.444 --> 36:16.845
ME, TOO.

36:16.845 --> 36:19.878
I'M AT THE SONAIT HOUSE.
WHERE ARE THEY PUTTING YOU UP?

36:19.878 --> 36:22.911
UM...

36:22.911 --> 36:24.453
WINDSOR COURT.

36:24.453 --> 36:26.255
OH, NO. SONAIT HOUSE
IS MUCH BETTER.

36:26.255 --> 36:28.557
THE BREAKFAST BISCUITS
WILL MAKE YOU JUMP UP AND DOWN.

36:28.557 --> 36:30.559
(both laugh)

36:30.559 --> 36:32.561
WHEN DO YOU FLY IN?

36:32.561 --> 36:34.563
UH, I THINK IT'S THURSDAY.

36:34.563 --> 36:36.795
I FLY IN THURSDAY, TOO.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.897
(both speak inaudibly)

36:38.897 --> 36:41.930
(woman)
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

36:41.930 --> 36:43.932
MY WHOLE CHARLIE IS BACK.

36:43.932 --> 36:44.973
MM.

36:44.973 --> 36:47.236
YOU PEOPLE
ARE MIRACLE WORKERS.

36:47.236 --> 36:49.408
SO HOW LONG TILL
I'M BACK ON THE LADDER?

36:49.408 --> 36:50.739
I-I JUST GOT A TILE SAW...
UH-HUH.

36:50.739 --> 36:52.641
AND I'M GONNA MOSAIC
THE STUCCO.

36:52.641 --> 36:55.384
YOU CA--DR. SHEPHERD,
TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

36:55.384 --> 36:56.945
IT'S REALLY NOT MY PLACE.

36:56.945 --> 36:58.947
BUT IF YOU WANT TO
SAY SOMETHING TO YOUR HUSBAND,

36:58.947 --> 37:01.350
PLEASE, BY ALL MEANS,
YOU SHOULD DO IT.

37:01.350 --> 37:04.253
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
TO WORK ON THE HOUSE,

37:04.253 --> 37:06.855
BUT LISTEN TO ME,
YOU ARE CLUMSY.

37:06.855 --> 37:10.259
AND I CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT
OF ALMOST LOSING YOU AGAIN.

37:10.259 --> 37:11.900
SO WOULD YOU JUST TAKE
A SECOND

37:11.900 --> 37:13.862
AND WHAT'S LEFT
OF YOUR BRAIN

37:13.862 --> 37:16.735
AND THINK ABOUT HOW I FELT
ABOUT IT,

37:16.735 --> 37:19.268
HOW SCARED I WAS
TO LOSE YOU FOREVER?

37:19.268 --> 37:21.970
(Charlie sighs)

37:23.542 --> 37:24.743
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.915
I'M SORRY, BABE.

37:26.915 --> 37:29.448
I'LL--I'LL--I'LL FIND
A NEW HOBBY.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.849
RIGHT, SOMETHING--
SOMETHING WE CAN DO TOGETHER,

37:30.849 --> 37:32.351
LIKE, UH, BOWLING.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.423
OH, NO, UM, I--
I HATE BOWLING.

37:34.423 --> 37:35.924
BUT YOU NEVER EVEN TRIED IT.

37:35.924 --> 37:38.387
WELL, YOU CAN HATE SOMETHING
WITHOUT TRYING IT.

37:38.387 --> 37:41.390
♪♪♪

37:42.861 --> 37:44.463
OH.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.934
HEY.

37:45.934 --> 37:47.466
HEY.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.998
THANKS, UH, FOR TODAY.

37:49.998 --> 37:52.341
FOR--FOR LETTING ME, UH...

37:52.341 --> 37:53.842
YOU DID A GOOD JOB
IN THERE.

37:53.842 --> 37:55.304
THANKS.

37:55.304 --> 37:56.475
(sighs)

37:56.475 --> 37:57.976
YOU OKAY?

37:57.976 --> 37:59.878
I LOVE YOU.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.451
OH, G--OH, MY GOD.
THAT JUST CAME...

38:02.451 --> 38:04.353
FLY-FLYING OUT OF MY FACE

38:04.353 --> 38:05.714
LIKE IT WAS
S-S-SOME KIND OF--

38:05.714 --> 38:07.356
I-I L--I LOVE YOU.

38:07.356 --> 38:09.318
I JUST--GOD.

38:09.318 --> 38:10.989
DID IT AGAIN. (laughs)

38:10.989 --> 38:12.861
I...
I-I-I-I LOVE YOU.

38:12.861 --> 38:15.694
I-I DO. I JUST--
I-I LOVE YOU.

38:15.694 --> 38:18.296
AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING
NOT TO SAY IT.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.499
I HAVE BEEN TRYING SO HARD
TO JUST MASH IT DOWN

38:20.499 --> 38:22.331
AND IGNORE IT
AND NOT SAY IT.

38:22.331 --> 38:25.303
AND JACKSON IS A GREAT GUY.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.707
HE--HE IS, AND HE--
HE'S GORGEOUS,

38:28.707 --> 38:30.038
AND--AND HE'S YOUNGER
THAN YOU,

38:30.038 --> 38:31.380
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY GRANDKIDS

38:31.380 --> 38:33.342
OR--OR BABIES
WITH HIS LESBIAN B.F.F.s

38:33.342 --> 38:37.586
AND HE'S AN AVERY, AND--AND HE
LIKED ME, YOU KNOW?

38:37.586 --> 38:39.518
HE--HE REALLY LIKED ME.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.520
BUT IT WAS NEVER
GONNA WORK OUT

38:41.520 --> 38:44.052
BECAUSE I-I LOVE YOU.

38:44.052 --> 38:46.755
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

38:46.755 --> 38:49.958
AND YOU'RE--YOU'RE--
YOU'RE IN ME.

38:49.958 --> 38:52.931
IT'S--YOU'RE LIKE--IT'S--
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE A DISEASE.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.734
IT'S LIKE I AM INFECTED
BY MARK SLOAN.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.366
(laughs) AND I JUST CAN'T--

38:57.366 --> 39:00.409
(voice breaking) I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING OR ANYBODY,

39:00.409 --> 39:03.572
AND I CAN'T SLEEP.

39:03.572 --> 39:05.674
(crying) I CAN'T BREATHE.

39:05.674 --> 39:07.015
I CAN'T EAT.

39:07.015 --> 39:09.378
AND I LOVE YOU. I JUST--
I LOVE YOU ALL THE TIME,

39:09.378 --> 39:11.380
JUST EVERY MINUTE
OF EVERY DAY. (laughs)

39:11.380 --> 39:13.452
(normal voice) AND I-I-I--

39:13.452 --> 39:15.724
I-I...

39:15.724 --> 39:19.528
LOVE YOU.

39:19.528 --> 39:22.431
GOD, THAT FEELS GOOD,

39:22.431 --> 39:23.732
TO J--I AM--

39:23.732 --> 39:25.734
(laughs)
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

39:25.734 --> 39:27.996
JUST... I LOVE YOU.

39:27.996 --> 39:30.769

GOOD. WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

39:57.966 --> 40:00.068
DUDE--
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

40:00.068 --> 40:02.100
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.503
I MEAN, WH-WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL ME? I'M A DOCTOR.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.475

I MEAN, YOU SHOULD'VE
FREAKIN' CALLED ME!

NATUROPATHY WORKS, TOO,
FLAGSTAFF.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.111
WHOA.
IT'S NOT FLAGSTAFF!

40:13.111 --> 40:14.813
AND IT'S NOT PHOENIX
AND IT'S NOT TEMPE.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.045
IT'S ARIZONA ROBBINS, M.D.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

40:17.045 --> 40:18.587
HOW DO YOU SPELL IT?

40:18.587 --> 40:20.889
IT'S NOT FUNNY, NICK.
NOTHING IS FUNNY. YOU'RE DYING!

40:20.889 --> 40:23.091
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HELL IT WAS
WHEN TIM DIED

40:23.091 --> 40:24.853
BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE,

40:24.853 --> 40:26.154
AND--AND YOU AND I
BARELY MADE IT THROUGH THAT.

40:26.154 --> 40:28.156
SO TO DO NOTHING
FOR SIX YEARS

40:28.156 --> 40:29.998
AND THEN TO COME
WHEN IT'S TOO LATE,

40:29.998 --> 40:31.930
I... I...

40:31.930 --> 40:34.503
WHY DO YOU THINK I DIDN'T
COME TO YOU SOONER?

40:37.005 --> 40:39.107
AS IF AFTER TIM DIED,
I COULD...

40:41.510 --> 40:44.873
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS MUST FEEL FOR YOU?

40:44.873 --> 40:46.475
YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

40:46.475 --> 40:50.018
I COULDN'T HAVE HELPED TIM,
BUT I COULD'VE HELPED YOU!

40:50.018 --> 40:54.452
(people speaking indistinctly)

40:59.558 --> 41:02.190
I'LL ADMIT,
THE ROMANS HAD A POINT.

41:02.190 --> 41:04.192
(siren wailing)

41:04.192 --> 41:06.665
YOU'VE GOTTA LIVE LIFE.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.668
UGH. GOTTA PEE. GOTTA PEE.
GOTTA PEE. GOTTA PEE. GOTTA PEE.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.902
OH! IT'S SUPPOSED TO COME
ONLINE AT MIDNIGHT.

41:13.902 --> 41:15.203
I MEAN,
IT'S FOUR MINUTES LATE.

41:15.203 --> 41:16.875
COME ON, PEOPLE.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.807
CRAZY DOCTORS,
THEY CRASHED THE SYSTEM.

41:18.807 --> 41:20.779
I ALREADY KNOW I FAILED,
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY

41:20.779 --> 41:22.781
I KEEP HITTING
THE REFRESH BUTTON.
(buttons beeping)

41:22.781 --> 41:25.554
AND LIVING MEANS THAT
EVERY MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP

41:25.554 --> 41:26.785
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE...

41:26.785 --> 41:28.486
OKAY, IF ANYONE FAILED,
IT WAS ME,

41:28.486 --> 41:29.918
BECAUSE MY GUY
HAD A VENDETTA.

41:29.918 --> 41:31.489
PLEASE. I'VE GOT
THE ODDS ON FAILURE.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.491
ARE ANY OF YOU ON CALL?
I'VE GOT A TRAUMA.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.223
(all) NO!

41:35.223 --> 41:36.565
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

41:36.565 --> 41:38.266
(people speaking indistinctly)

41:38.266 --> 41:39.998
I PASSED. I PASSED.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.269
I PASSED! I PASSED!
I PASSED! YES!

41:41.269 --> 41:42.631
I PASSED! I PASSED!

41:42.631 --> 41:43.902
OH, MY GOD!
YEAH!

41:43.902 --> 41:45.534
(laughing)

41:45.534 --> 41:46.905
BETWEEN SEIZING WHAT LIFE
OFFERS IN THE MOMENT

41:46.905 --> 41:49.507
AND FORGING AHEAD,
NO MATTER THE WEATHER...

41:49.507 --> 41:51.209
ALEX?
(groans)
IT'S NOT COMING UP.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.781
HERE. HERE. USE MINE.

41:52.781 --> 41:55.584
(siren wailing)

41:55.584 --> 41:56.985
(drums on chest)

41:56.985 --> 41:59.588
(all laugh)

41:59.588 --> 42:00.919
OH, UNH!

42:00.919 --> 42:02.951
YES!
(shouts indistinctly)

42:02.951 --> 42:04.793
(all laughing)

42:04.793 --> 42:07.225
(singing indistinctly)

42:07.225 --> 42:08.597
(laughing continues)

42:08.597 --> 42:10.158
WAIT. WAIT.
WHERE IS APRIL?

42:10.158 --> 42:11.529
(wailing continues)

42:11.529 --> 42:13.061
OR CLOSING THE CURTAINS...

42:13.061 --> 42:16.835
(wailing continues)

42:18.737 --> 42:22.110
AND SHUTTING OUT THE DAY.

42:22.110 --> 42:23.271
(wailing continues)

42:23.271 --> 42:24.242
(hydraulic brakes hiss)

42:24.242 --> 42:32.020
(engine rumbles)
