00:20.088 --> 00:23.920
<i>The incredible legends of
the abominable Dr Phibes</i>

00:24.051 --> 00:28.713
<i>began a few short years ago. All
them are, unfortunately, true.</i>

00:28.847 --> 00:31.931
<i>It was here, in London's
fashionable Maldine Square,</i>

00:32.058 --> 00:35.926
<i>whence Phibes ventured out to
work his diabolical revenge</i>

00:36.063 --> 00:40.226
<i>against those responsible for the
death of his beloved wife Victoria</i>

00:40.359 --> 00:42.647
<i>and the destruction
of his own face,</i>

00:42.778 --> 00:47.155
<i>making it necessary to talk through
an ingenious mechanism in his neck.</i>

00:47.282 --> 00:52.656
<i>My wife existed only six minutes
on the operating table.</i>

00:52.788 --> 00:55.160
<i>You murdered her.</i>

00:55.290 --> 01:02.871
<i>When the acid reaches him, he
will have a face like mine.</i>

01:16.729 --> 01:21.308
<i>The minds of Scotland Yard were
baffled as the murders continued,</i>

01:21.442 --> 01:23.601
<i>each more fiendish than the last.</i>

01:23.736 --> 01:25.895
<i>And in his basement of his mansion,</i>

01:26.030 --> 01:29.695
<i>none could hear his flamboyant
songs of triumph and revenge,</i>

01:29.826 --> 01:33.989
<i>played on his organ and by his
ingenious clockwork musicians.</i>

01:37.000 --> 01:38.624
We have got to find Phibes.

01:38.751 --> 01:43.912
<i>Only by a stroke of amazing luck did
the police seek out Maldine Square.</i>

01:46.509 --> 01:50.838
<i>But the fiendish Dr Phibes was
prepared for such an emergency,</i>

01:50.972 --> 01:53.724
<i>and, building his face anew,</i>

01:53.850 --> 01:57.894
<i>he entered the crypt, where he
had enshrined his beloved wife,</i>

01:58.021 --> 02:02.848
<i>incredibly maintained neither
alive nor completely dead.</i>

02:03.943 --> 02:07.989
<i>And there Phibes placed himself
in suspended life, like her,</i>

02:08.115 --> 02:12.528
<i>until it would be time for
Phibes to rise again.</i>

02:28.344 --> 02:31.510
<i>It's as if he disappeared
off the face of the earth.</i>

02:33.349 --> 02:37.263
<i>Phibes lay in darkness three
years, until the moon,</i>

02:37.394 --> 02:40.894
<i>coming into proper conjunction
with the eternal planets,</i>

02:41.023 --> 02:46.812
<i>shone upon the golden moon of the crypt,
pulsing with a fantastic life of its own.</i>

02:53.661 --> 02:56.448
<i>Lifeblood then flowed
back into Phibes,</i>

02:56.580 --> 02:59.202
<i>great wheels and motors
sprung into motion,</i>

02:59.333 --> 03:03.795
<i>and Dr Phibes once more
walked upon the Earth.</i>

05:23.981 --> 05:31.727
<i>Victoria, for three years
I have rested beside you.</i>

05:31.864 --> 05:37.949
<i>Tonight, the glorious moon has
risen to the exact position</i>

05:38.078 --> 05:42.907
<i>which last occurred
2,000 years ago,</i>

05:43.043 --> 05:46.458
<i>signalling the opening
of this crypt</i>

05:46.588 --> 05:51.214
<i>and the beginning of our
greatest adventure.</i>

05:51.343 --> 05:54.877
<i>We shall embark to
the land of Egypt,</i>

05:55.013 --> 06:00.007
<i>where, years ago, in a mountain
overlooking the Valley of the Pharaohs,</i>

06:00.143 --> 06:04.639
<i>I did prepare for us
a wondrous shrine</i>

06:04.773 --> 06:08.521
<i>unknown by any living man.</i>

06:08.652 --> 06:14.357
<i>There, my beloved, awaits the
key to resurrection for you</i>

06:14.491 --> 06:18.785
<i>and eternal life for both of us.</i>

06:19.871 --> 06:25.826
<i>And, once again,
I call on you, Vulnavia.</i>

06:25.960 --> 06:29.045
<i>Come one more time,
my trusted aide.</i>

06:29.172 --> 06:31.628
<i>Join me and my beloved,</i>

06:31.758 --> 06:39.470
<i>for we have work to do to
bring her back to life.</i>

07:16.762 --> 07:21.341
<i>Thank you, my dear, for
answering my call.</i>

07:21.475 --> 07:28.523
<i>Upstairs, in my safe, is a
most precious map of papyrus,</i>

07:28.650 --> 07:31.402
<i>the way to a Pharaoh's tomb,</i>

07:31.528 --> 07:36.985
<i>beneath which flows each 2,000
years the River of Life.</i>

07:37.117 --> 07:43.321
<i>We must make haste and find
the river at its flood.</i>

08:09.274 --> 08:15.811
<i>Let us go upstairs and
prepare for our journey.</i>

08:20.787 --> 08:22.614
<i>No! No!</i>

08:22.747 --> 08:26.198
<i>While I slept in sweet oblivion,</i>

08:26.334 --> 08:29.418
<i>who dared destroy my house?!</i>

08:29.546 --> 08:31.585
<i>The safe.</i>

08:31.714 --> 08:33.789
<i>The safe!</i>

08:33.924 --> 08:36.546
<i>Could it still be here?</i>

08:39.389 --> 08:41.216
<i>There!</i>

08:55.989 --> 08:58.065
<i>What fiend has taken it?!</i>

08:58.199 --> 09:03.324
<i>Only one who seeks eternal
life as I do. Biederbeck!</i>

09:03.454 --> 09:07.998
The papyrus. And yet,
paradoxically, worthless.

09:09.127 --> 09:11.534
Yes, Ambrose, worthless.

09:11.671 --> 09:17.757
For without my interpretation of the
translation it has no value or significance.

09:17.887 --> 09:22.347
Three years it took me to come upon
this grand and final realisation.

09:22.474 --> 09:27.136
It was the one... the one piece
I had searched for my whole life.

09:27.271 --> 09:29.310
May I, Biederbeck?

09:33.141 --> 09:34.184
Ah.

09:34.288 --> 09:38.400
So this is the papyrus that
I've read so much about.

09:38.532 --> 09:40.691
I've made no secret of it.

09:40.826 --> 09:43.578
When they demolished a
house in Maldine Square,

09:43.704 --> 09:48.829
it came into the hands of a dealer who
contacted me, knowing of my interest.

09:50.544 --> 09:54.957
This seems to be almost a matter
of life and death to you.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.048
You're a strange man.

09:57.176 --> 10:01.256
Acclaimed as one of the most brilliant
minds in the Western hemisphere,

10:01.388 --> 10:04.097
- yet you seem obsessed with...
- Yes?

10:04.123 --> 10:07.283
The spiritual, the
mythical aspect of life.

10:07.813 --> 10:10.268
Of course I'm obsessed with life.

10:10.398 --> 10:13.732
And somewhere in Egypt that
obsession will be answered.

10:14.444 --> 10:18.109
This... This is all hypothesis.

10:19.324 --> 10:21.862
Five years ago I
toured the whole area.

10:21.993 --> 10:24.401
Indeed, Ambrose.

10:24.538 --> 10:26.162
And nothing.

10:26.289 --> 10:29.207
I remember looking down
upon the whole valley.

10:29.334 --> 10:31.907
That, my friend, was
your greatest mistake.

10:32.045 --> 10:35.580
You looked down. Did it never
occur to you to look up?

10:35.715 --> 10:37.625
- The sky?
- Exactly.

10:37.759 --> 10:40.926
That's where the answer lies.

10:41.054 --> 10:43.130
The stars.

10:43.765 --> 10:45.592
The moon.

10:47.602 --> 10:50.603
The sky is the key.

10:50.730 --> 10:56.484
While you look down, I look up. The rings
of Saturn, when were they discovered?

10:56.611 --> 11:00.194
- Beginning of the 18th century.
- Exactly.

11:01.325 --> 11:03.484
And yet, look here.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.455
See? Plainly marked.

11:06.581 --> 11:10.246
And that map is 5,000 years old.

11:10.376 --> 11:12.618
And this.

11:12.754 --> 11:15.624
Only a fragment, but
what significance!

11:15.757 --> 11:20.253
It's a page from the log of a Phoenician
ship. Notice the positioning of the stars.

11:20.386 --> 11:25.344
A chart more sophisticated than anything
we allowed for in our calculations.

11:25.475 --> 11:29.887
And, finally, this.
The Temple of Ibiscus.

11:30.813 --> 11:34.016
- That's where we're going.
- What do you hope to find?

11:34.150 --> 11:38.278
If there's treasure, gold, it's yours.
I'm seeking something more.

11:38.404 --> 11:42.484
- What more do you want?
- I like to think he wants me.

11:42.617 --> 11:47.362
I can tell by your face, you've forgotten.
We're dining with Princess Rica.

11:47.497 --> 11:51.826
I'm sorry. I'll go up and change.
Make Ambrose a drink, will you?

11:57.257 --> 12:01.551
- When are you two going to?
- Get married? You'd better ask Darius.

12:01.678 --> 12:03.967
Perhaps after this trip.

12:04.098 --> 12:07.846
Sometimes it's like... as if he's
going to Egypt for my benefit.

12:07.976 --> 12:13.101
Every day he grows more preoccupied with
something. I wish I knew what it was.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.805
Oh, Ambrose, I don't want to go!

12:15.943 --> 12:20.854
- But I thought you wanted to go.
- No, I wasn't talking about tonight.

12:20.989 --> 12:23.278
Well, are we ready?

12:24.284 --> 12:26.740
Here we go, then.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.619
Huh! Come along, my dear.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.076
At least the meal
should be interesting.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.169
We should get a good
claret, anyhow.

12:37.297 --> 12:42.256
Darius, we can't keep the princess
waiting. Blue blood, you know.

16:35.207 --> 16:41.661
<i>So, once more I have been forced
to kill for you, Victoria,</i>

16:41.797 --> 16:45.083
<i>only that you may live again.</i>

16:45.217 --> 16:49.963
<i>For here, where mystic
lines converge,</i>

16:50.097 --> 16:59.101
<i>we'll find the door that separates
the living from the dead!</i>

17:02.526 --> 17:05.099
I see.

17:05.237 --> 17:09.234
Has he any known relatives
in this country, sir?

17:09.366 --> 17:11.692
It would seem most unlikely.

17:11.827 --> 17:14.579
May I ask how long has he
been in your employment?

17:14.705 --> 17:17.577
- That is academic. The papy...
- That may be...

17:17.709 --> 17:20.496
Don't interrupt me!
It damned well is so.

17:20.628 --> 17:25.919
The papyrus is missing, and that's all I'm
concerned about. Not this postmortem.

17:26.050 --> 17:30.843
Now let's get our priorities right. A man
has been senselessly killed, murdered.

17:30.972 --> 17:35.266
All right, so he has. But I
have been senselessly robbed.

17:35.393 --> 17:40.636
Curious as that may seem, the latter is
all that I care about. Do you understand?

17:40.774 --> 17:45.566
Find the papyrus, and that will lead you
to the killer. But find the papyrus first.

17:45.695 --> 17:47.487
You have 24 hours.

17:47.614 --> 17:52.572
Now, this papyrus, who exactly would
know that it was in your possession?

17:52.702 --> 17:55.703
Any interested party. I made
no secret of its purchase.

17:55.831 --> 18:01.667
But it would interest only a few scholars...
all, I assure you, above suspicion.

18:01.795 --> 18:06.042
No, Trout, what you are looking for
is a common thief who was surprised.

18:06.174 --> 18:10.220
A man who pierces the skull of
another man with a golden snake?

18:10.346 --> 18:13.596
That's not a common
thief, sir. With respect.

18:13.724 --> 18:18.849
- With respect, what are you suggesting?
- That it was a calculated act.

18:18.980 --> 18:21.767
By a man who knows the
true value of the papyrus?

18:21.899 --> 18:23.441
Yes, sir.

18:25.361 --> 18:31.565
<i>No force in all the
world can stop us now.</i>

18:31.701 --> 18:37.620
<i>For in a mountain range
where Pharaohs once reside,</i>

18:37.749 --> 18:42.126
<i>a palace I have built
beneath the stone.</i>

18:42.253 --> 18:50.961
<i>And there we'll wait until the great
appointed tide reveals a secret door,</i>

18:51.095 --> 18:55.722
<i>through which we'll find new life.</i>

18:58.186 --> 19:02.516
<i>And now, bon voyage to all of us.</i>

19:02.649 --> 19:09.482
<i>With you, Victoria, safe in your
sealed abode, we drive to Southampton.</i>

19:09.615 --> 19:13.447
<i>Then Channel, then the open sea.</i>

19:13.577 --> 19:16.993
<i>Come, Vulnavia, we sail!</i>

20:14.055 --> 20:21.719
<i>Ah, sweet Victoria, what happy
times of years ago I think of now.</i>

20:21.855 --> 20:27.145
<i>It won't be long, my love,
before we've reached our goal.</i>

20:27.277 --> 20:34.525
<i>And moving, breathing, you in
my arms again and I in yours.</i>

20:34.659 --> 20:37.613
<i>In Egypt I shall find the key,</i>

20:37.746 --> 20:41.280
<i>the key to the elixir of life.</i>

20:43.877 --> 20:46.794
<i>June 1st. At sea, bound for Egypt.</i>

20:46.921 --> 20:50.126
<i>I'm taking three drops
of my elixir of life.</i>

20:50.259 --> 20:52.584
<i>The vials are almost empty.</i>

20:52.720 --> 20:56.006
<i>If I fail in Egypt, I am doomed.</i>

21:35.554 --> 21:39.338
"Awaken, O sick one!
Thou has slept."

21:39.475 --> 21:43.260
"They have lifted thine head
toward the horizon. Appear!"

21:43.397 --> 21:48.474
"Thou art justified against those
that sought to do thee harm."

21:48.610 --> 21:51.730
One of my favourite passages
from <i>The Book of the Dead.</i>

21:51.863 --> 21:56.572
All relating to the divine incarnation
and the phenomenon of rebirth.

21:56.702 --> 21:58.943
Singularly appropriate, Ambrose.

22:03.083 --> 22:07.295
<i>Our voyage has now begun, Vulnavia.</i>

22:07.421 --> 22:13.506
<i>Though brief, the time aboard this
ship will seem too long, I know,</i>

22:13.635 --> 22:17.633
<i>so eager are we to arrive in Egypt</i>

22:17.764 --> 22:23.968
<i>and complete the preparations
I began long years ago.</i>

22:25.397 --> 22:30.557
<i>Here, in the mountain
marked on this papyrus,</i>

22:30.694 --> 22:36.947
<i>beyond corridors which led once
to a Pharaoh's hidden tomb,</i>

22:37.076 --> 22:41.537
<i>awaits the key to
resurrection and to life.</i>

22:41.664 --> 22:43.823
<i>I shall decipher it!</i>

22:43.958 --> 22:49.712
<i>Nothing, nothing will stop me now!</i>

22:51.049 --> 22:57.965
<i>I must tell Victoria, hidden safe
below away from curious eyes.</i>

22:58.097 --> 23:03.684
<i>We have but three short weeks
until that glorious day.</i>

23:03.811 --> 23:07.097
How would you pinpoint the most
important part of the globe?

23:07.232 --> 23:09.604
Rocks erode and fall.

23:09.734 --> 23:12.770
Sand changes daily, hourly.

23:12.904 --> 23:16.107
Rivers flood, twist,
form new courses.

23:16.241 --> 23:21.780
Topographically, the world is in
a perpetual flux. But the sky...

23:21.913 --> 23:24.404
The sky remains the
one constant factor.

23:24.541 --> 23:28.409
What are all these theories
of yours leading up to?

23:28.546 --> 23:30.871
They're not my theories alone.

23:31.006 --> 23:35.134
Ancient civilisations knew
about this, capitalised on it.

23:36.262 --> 23:38.301
To what end?

23:39.139 --> 23:42.923
The return of the
life force, Ambrose.

23:43.060 --> 23:46.394
As I say, they're not my theories.
They're 3,000 years old.

23:46.522 --> 23:51.065
Let me show you another aspect of this.
Where's that model of the mountain?

23:51.193 --> 23:53.815
- In the hold.
- Then I'll tell you tomorrow.

23:53.946 --> 23:58.822
But, Biederbeck, I won't be able
to sleep. I must know, tonight.

23:58.951 --> 24:02.154
I'll get it. Have you discussed
this with anybody else?

24:02.288 --> 24:03.865
Of course not.

24:03.998 --> 24:09.158
And, Ambrose, I forbid you to
tell anyone of this conversation.

24:20.097 --> 24:23.348
Probably one of these.
Let's see now.

24:25.562 --> 24:27.851
No. No, that's not it.

24:28.356 --> 24:30.230
Huh!

24:30.358 --> 24:33.858
Not quite the kind of
model I'm looking for.

24:33.987 --> 24:37.107
It might just be
stored in here, sir.

24:38.742 --> 24:40.616
Empty, I suppose.

24:40.744 --> 24:42.736
Pity.

24:42.871 --> 24:45.825
Ah! That looks more like it. Yes.

24:45.957 --> 24:49.373
Thank you very much. I mustn't
keep you from your duties.

24:49.503 --> 24:52.753
- I could quite easily just...
- I can manage by myself.

24:52.881 --> 24:55.372
- As you say, sir.
- Thank you. Good night.

24:55.509 --> 24:58.463
Good night to you, sir.

25:01.181 --> 25:02.759
What the hell?

26:29.104 --> 26:31.642
Come in.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.106
- Biederbeck.
- Yes, Captain?

26:35.235 --> 26:37.643
I'm sorry to be the
bearer of bad news.

26:37.780 --> 26:41.231
I have made two sweeps and
found no trace of your friend.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.451
Very well, then. That's that.

26:44.578 --> 26:48.077
I'm afraid that we must
face up to the fact that...

26:48.207 --> 26:51.623
Well, time is running
out, Mr Biederbeck.

26:52.586 --> 26:55.042
No doubt you'll resume
your normal course.

26:55.172 --> 26:56.880
Good heavens, no!

26:57.007 --> 27:00.506
Naturally, I intend to use
my every power to find him.

27:00.637 --> 27:03.591
We shall search until
dawn, if necessary.

27:03.723 --> 27:07.970
But you said yourself, there's
no hope. It's been two hours.

27:08.103 --> 27:10.428
This delay is intolerable.

27:10.563 --> 27:13.730
Please bring your
ship around, Captain.

27:13.858 --> 27:17.773
I remind you that the navigation
of this ship is my responsibility.

27:17.904 --> 27:21.190
I shall, of course, bear
your suggestion in mind.

27:23.743 --> 27:27.029
- Was he a good swimmer?
- I have no idea, Captain.

27:30.834 --> 27:33.704
I suppose he never...
How can I put this?

27:34.587 --> 27:36.829
I supposed he never
touched the bottle?

27:36.965 --> 27:39.966
Then how'd he get in there
in the first place?

27:40.093 --> 27:44.221
The blighter must have
drunk his way in.

27:57.028 --> 28:00.313
I come back from leave and the
first thing I find is this!

28:00.448 --> 28:03.069
Oh? What's that, then, sir?

28:03.200 --> 28:06.154
"The Gloucester Squirt murder."

28:06.287 --> 28:09.905
"The Gloucester <i>Square</i> murder."
I can hardly read your writing.

28:10.041 --> 28:14.418
"On arrival, I discovered the
man's body surrounded by..."

28:16.213 --> 28:18.206
- Balls.
- Look here, Trout!

28:18.341 --> 28:21.792
- On the snooker table, sir.
- What?

28:23.210 --> 28:24.253
Oh.

28:24.357 --> 28:26.885
"...balls on the snooker table."

28:27.016 --> 28:32.141
"Cause of death was apparently
by a small gold... snake"?

28:34.106 --> 28:36.313
"...which entered
the man's left ear,

28:36.442 --> 28:39.811
and, having pierced the skull,
reappeared through the right."

28:39.946 --> 28:42.104
In one ear and out the other, sir.

28:42.239 --> 28:45.490
"Death, it would appear,
was... instantaneous."

28:45.618 --> 28:51.242
Brilliant! Why was his employer, the main
witness, allowed to leave the country?

28:51.375 --> 28:54.826
It was a delicate matter,
involving a difficult gentleman.

28:54.962 --> 28:59.125
You're dealing with a more difficult
one now! Do you know what time it is?

28:59.258 --> 29:01.749
- After one.
- I've been waiting since nine!

29:01.885 --> 29:03.712
I was called out last night.

29:03.845 --> 29:07.261
- Where to?
- Er, what's it called? Fawley.

29:07.391 --> 29:10.973
- Never heard of it.
- It's at the mouth of Southampton Water.

29:11.103 --> 29:14.637
A man's body had been washed up.

29:14.773 --> 29:17.015
- Fallen overboard?
- In a sense, sir.

29:17.150 --> 29:21.397
Men fall overboard all the time.
That's what the locals are for!

29:21.530 --> 29:24.400
This one was inside a bottle, sir.

29:25.909 --> 29:28.579
- Do what?
- He was inside a bottle.

29:28.704 --> 29:32.286
Glass, it was. About
seven feet long.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.622
Corked?

29:37.421 --> 29:41.502
<i>To Egypt, and our arrival here.</i>

29:50.476 --> 29:55.020
<i>My compliments to you, Vulnavia.</i>

29:57.442 --> 30:02.602
<i>You have done wonders
with the local fish.</i>

30:31.809 --> 30:35.226
<i>But we must not dally.</i>

30:35.356 --> 30:41.145
<i>While Victoria safely sleeps, we
must hasten to the caves within</i>

30:41.278 --> 30:46.439
<i>and learn what time has wrought
since last I ventured there.</i>

32:23.174 --> 32:26.507
<i>See, Vulnavia!</i>

32:26.636 --> 32:30.171
<i>Not a thing has been disturbed.</i>

32:30.306 --> 32:35.597
<i>Some minor decorating,
some touching up,</i>

32:35.728 --> 32:40.520
<i>and it will seem like home.</i>

32:40.650 --> 32:42.689
<i>Lights!</i>

32:42.819 --> 32:46.318
<i>Music, Vulnavia!</i>

32:46.447 --> 32:49.816
<i>A song of celebration.</i>

32:49.951 --> 32:52.074
<i>Unveil the band.</i>

33:08.428 --> 33:12.472
- We're looking for a madman, sir.
- You've bloody well found one!

33:12.598 --> 33:16.467
Do you realise that this
is Saturday afternoon?!

33:16.603 --> 33:19.604
We thought we'd have a little
talk with you in private...

33:19.732 --> 33:22.982
We do appreciate you coming
at such short notice, Mr?

33:23.110 --> 33:27.855
Lombardo. I didn't have much option with
a police car rolling up outside my club.

33:27.990 --> 33:32.367
Frightful intrusion! And, as I
say, on a Saturday afternoon.

33:32.494 --> 33:36.907
- Well, it is a rather delicate matter, sir.
- Oh?

33:37.041 --> 33:40.706
- We've, um...
- We've found a body.

33:40.836 --> 33:43.920
- I didn't know you'd mislaid one. Whose?
- Ambrose's.

33:44.048 --> 33:47.251
- The man who fell off the...
- Ah, him!

33:47.384 --> 33:48.629
Yes, sir.

33:48.761 --> 33:52.889
If it's about insurance, it's much too
early for me to commit. I mean...

33:53.015 --> 33:57.641
Well, it seemed pretty obvious
that he was... pissed.

33:57.770 --> 34:00.011
- We're loath...
- I beg your pardon?

34:01.356 --> 34:04.856
loath to involve anybody
else at this juncture.

34:04.985 --> 34:08.818
But we have a strong reason to
believe that he was murdered.

34:08.947 --> 34:11.902
- Murdered?
- Killed.

34:12.034 --> 34:14.822
Yeah, I got that.
Shoved the old boy off, eh?

34:14.954 --> 34:18.952
- Did you know the gentleman?
- Not intimately, but professionally.

34:19.083 --> 34:23.128
He went on cruises to the Middle
East. He was an archaeologist.

34:23.254 --> 34:27.085
Digging around in the dirt.
Like you chaps.

34:27.217 --> 34:30.301
- Quite.
- This may seem an obvious question, sir,

34:30.428 --> 34:34.507
but on this passenger list was there
anyone you'd describe as at all...

34:34.641 --> 34:37.262
how shall I put it... odd?

34:37.393 --> 34:41.342
The whole ruddy lot of them.
No, that's a slight exaggeration.

34:41.481 --> 34:45.146
No, I wouldn't say
exceptionally odd.

34:45.275 --> 34:47.565
Oddish?

34:51.366 --> 34:53.572
Well... is that it?

34:55.078 --> 34:56.905
For the time being. Thank you.

34:57.038 --> 35:01.167
If you should have second thoughts,
we would like to hear from you.

35:01.294 --> 35:03.286
All right, you can rely on me.

35:03.421 --> 35:06.790
We do have a lot of eccentric
people on these tours.

35:06.924 --> 35:10.376
- It takes all sorts.
- Incidentally, there was a woman...

35:10.511 --> 35:12.836
Oh, well. Another
story, another time.

35:12.972 --> 35:16.139
Whatever they ask for, we
try to keep them happy.

35:16.267 --> 35:19.552
- We get chaps wanting pianos.
- Really, sir?

35:19.687 --> 35:22.723
I suppose if it helps
the old thing along.

35:22.857 --> 35:25.099
Quite so, sir.
We are grateful for...

35:25.234 --> 35:28.852
Do you know, on this last trip,
a fellow wanted an organ.

35:28.988 --> 35:30.731
Well, I'll be off.

35:30.865 --> 35:34.068
Would you say that again, sir?

35:34.201 --> 35:35.612
Well, I'll be off.

35:35.745 --> 35:38.152
No, no, no. Just before that, sir.

35:38.289 --> 35:40.116
- The organ?
- That's it.

35:40.249 --> 35:42.621
I think he was
probably an organist.

35:42.752 --> 35:45.539
The girl stipulated that
it be a cinema organ.

35:45.671 --> 35:48.293
- Which girl?
- The girl who did the booking.

35:48.424 --> 35:51.259
Was her employer's name Phibes?

35:51.385 --> 35:54.553
Phibes? No, Smith.
Get a hell a lot of Smiths.

35:54.681 --> 35:58.549
Smith, thank God for that. Thank you.
That was a nasty moment.

35:58.685 --> 36:01.770
- This girl who did?
- Don't waste the man's time.

36:01.897 --> 36:05.480
- Did you see the man at all?
- No, I didn't. I just saw the girl.

36:05.609 --> 36:09.441
She was a very beautiful girl.
Very tall. You'd have liked her.

36:09.571 --> 36:13.071
There was something strange.
I suppose she was an entertainer.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.984
Of course. Fellow's on the boards.
Wanted a bit of practice.

36:17.120 --> 36:21.201
- Did he take anything else?
- Organ music, bound to suit those Arabs.

36:21.333 --> 36:26.209
Clockwork musicians, life-size clockwork
musicians. That isn't all they took.

36:26.338 --> 36:29.173
They took a lot. I've got
the details in my office.

36:29.299 --> 36:32.917
I'd like to come along and take
a look. You didn't see the man?

36:33.053 --> 36:38.094
No, I didn't see the man. I just saw the girl.
She did the lot. She did the paying and...

36:38.225 --> 36:40.383
- Did she pay by cheque?
- No. Cash.

36:40.519 --> 36:42.346
- Return fare?
- No, single.

36:42.479 --> 36:45.231
Single. One-way.

36:45.357 --> 36:48.027
Maybe... he won't come back.

36:48.152 --> 36:52.020
It's Phibes, all right, sir.
And he always comes back.

37:26.900 --> 37:28.394
You know the saying:

37:28.526 --> 37:32.939
Build a better mousetrap and the
world will beat a path to your door.

37:33.072 --> 37:39.609
Every time we've built a better mousetrap,
sir, Phibes has built a better mouse.

37:39.746 --> 37:42.320
What the hell's that?

37:42.458 --> 37:47.084
Nothing to do with me, sir.
Are you sure it's not one of your?

37:47.838 --> 37:50.709
What do you mean, one of mine?

38:03.979 --> 38:05.224
Oh.

38:05.356 --> 38:07.728
So sorry, I must have
dropped right off.

38:07.858 --> 38:12.604
- May we ask why you're here?
- I've come to see Mr Waverley.

38:12.738 --> 38:15.609
Would you like me to go, sir?

38:16.742 --> 38:19.315
- I'm Waverley.
- Oh, isn't that nice?

38:19.453 --> 38:23.700
Such a sweet man showed me in.
I'm an Ambrose, you know.

38:23.833 --> 38:27.036
- Ambrose? You're?
- Cousin of the late Harry.

38:27.795 --> 38:31.294
We were very sorry about that.
It must have been a great shock.

38:31.423 --> 38:35.921
Not all that close, I'm afraid.
We kept in touch occasionally.

38:36.054 --> 38:38.675
I thought he was a
mysterious old bird.

38:38.807 --> 38:43.136
Can you tell us anything that
might be of any help, Miss... er?

38:43.270 --> 38:45.725
- Am... brose.
- Ambrose.

38:45.856 --> 38:48.940
Did anybody bear him a
grudge, or anything?

38:49.067 --> 38:54.310
Er, it's hardly likely, isn't it? He spent
most of his time leaping round the world.

38:54.448 --> 38:57.402
It's possible, I suppose, though.

38:57.534 --> 38:59.242
Hm.

38:59.369 --> 39:04.909
Just before you came in I took the
liberty of looking at this map.

39:05.041 --> 39:07.912
That's not where they're
going at all, you know.

39:08.044 --> 39:10.500
- Who?
- Biederbeck and that lot.

39:10.630 --> 39:14.545
Now... here.

39:14.676 --> 39:16.384
This is much more likely.

39:34.030 --> 39:38.941
- Where the devil is everybody?
- Mr Biederbeck, I'm Hackett. I imagine...

39:39.077 --> 39:43.869
The instructions were for everyone to wait
until I arrived at the base camp. Everyone.

39:43.998 --> 39:45.327
Hm.

39:45.458 --> 39:47.118
Well?

39:47.251 --> 39:51.119
Stewart and Baker couldn't wait.
They've gone off to the mountain.

39:51.255 --> 39:54.340
- To do what?
- They were getting a bit impatient.

39:54.467 --> 39:57.337
- And Shavers?
- Oh, he's around.

39:58.387 --> 40:00.214
- Hackett.
- Come on.

40:00.348 --> 40:03.302
- Come on where?
- You stay here and rest. Come on.

40:03.434 --> 40:09.223
No man should go near that mountain
alone. Nobody knows what's in there.

40:10.316 --> 40:14.693
<i>Sleep on, my sweet Victoria,</i>

40:14.821 --> 40:22.402
<i>for regal claws of sacred birds
guard well your place of rest.</i>

40:22.538 --> 40:30.830
<i>For those poor fools that dare
intrude, the penalty is death.</i>

42:43.723 --> 42:45.514
Argh!

43:33.482 --> 43:37.610
<i>Did you have a good dinner?</i>

44:29.747 --> 44:33.496
<i>Do you realise what this is?</i>

44:33.626 --> 44:40.424
<i>A secret room, hidden from
view so long as it is flooded.</i>

44:40.550 --> 44:45.591
<i>But now, as the moon
rises towards a zenith,</i>

44:45.722 --> 44:50.764
<i>the waters have receded and
they flow underground,</i>

44:50.895 --> 44:55.936
<i>perhaps into the hidden
River of Life itself.</i>

44:56.066 --> 45:03.030
<i>Somewhere through there,
Vulnavia, awaits our answer.</i>

46:05.428 --> 46:11.798
<i>What Pharaoh of what forgotten
dynasty rested here,</i>

46:11.935 --> 46:18.139
<i>before he drifted on the bosom of
what stream beneath these stones</i>

46:18.275 --> 46:21.359
<i>to find eternal life?</i>

46:30.162 --> 46:34.540
<i>A secret compartment
beneath the sarcophagus,</i>

46:35.126 --> 46:38.127
<i>large enough to hold Victoria.</i>

46:38.880 --> 46:42.165
<i>What other secrets lie within?</i>

46:44.844 --> 46:46.504
<i>A key.</i>

46:46.637 --> 46:49.757
<i>An actual key!</i>

46:49.891 --> 46:52.975
<i>How ironic and how clever.</i>

46:53.102 --> 46:58.938
<i>When I find the lock it
fits, I'll have the answer.</i>

47:04.864 --> 47:09.028
- Shavers! Baker! Where are you?
- Straight ahead, Biederbeck!

47:12.747 --> 47:16.579
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- Oh! Er...

47:16.709 --> 47:18.749
It's just a preliminary sortie.

47:18.878 --> 47:23.706
- On whose authority?
- Didn't realise we needed permission.

47:23.841 --> 47:27.542
Stewart, when you're older,
perhaps you'll respect authority.

47:27.678 --> 47:30.883
You might keep in mind that
you're a member of my team.

47:31.016 --> 47:34.966
And, er, is this
your mountain, sir?

47:35.104 --> 47:39.351
- I regard it as such, yes.
- Are we to take that literally, sir?

47:39.483 --> 47:42.934
You may take it however you wish.
But I give the orders.

47:43.070 --> 47:47.068
Any explorations will be planned
and led by me. Understood?

48:38.918 --> 48:43.082
You know, we're not
exactly amateurs here.

48:43.631 --> 48:49.966
If discoveries are to be made, it'll require
individual effort and intellectual freedom.

48:50.096 --> 48:52.422
There are no prima donnas here.

48:52.557 --> 48:55.760
Discoveries will be made by the
team, under my directions.

48:55.894 --> 49:01.315
Then perhaps you'll be so kind as to
enlighten us. Where is all this leading to?

49:01.441 --> 49:03.065
- In good time.
- Darius?

49:03.193 --> 49:07.273
- Not now.
- It's usual for all information to be pooled.

49:07.906 --> 49:11.571
- I've no doubt, but you will...
- It's rather urgent.

49:11.701 --> 49:16.245
- What is it?
- I have a little... discovery of my own

49:16.374 --> 49:19.244
that I think you ought to see.

49:59.125 --> 50:01.201
You mustn't let this upset you.

50:01.335 --> 50:03.873
Upset me? A man has
just been killed.

50:04.005 --> 50:07.041
You're in the desert,
not taking tea in Mayfair.

50:07.174 --> 50:10.011
Curious as it may seem, you
don't have to remind me.

50:10.137 --> 50:14.134
I've drunk lots of tea in Mayfair
without finding bodies at my feet.

50:14.266 --> 50:16.057
Would you just trust me?

50:16.184 --> 50:17.727
- Trust?
- Yes, trust.

50:17.853 --> 50:22.100
How far is that gonna get me? Or us?
How can I? You don't trust me.

50:22.232 --> 50:24.521
What's that supposed to mean?

50:24.651 --> 50:27.985
It's clear to me, you don't
trust me and you won't tell me.

50:28.113 --> 50:32.407
Your attitude has changed. Suddenly
human life means nothing to you.

50:32.534 --> 50:35.618
- Have I ever said that?
- No. But I just have.

50:35.746 --> 50:38.284
You're so callous now.

50:38.415 --> 50:43.919
- Is that what you really think?
- Do you honestly care what I really think?

50:44.046 --> 50:46.537
Of course I do.

50:46.673 --> 50:49.710
It's just that I...

50:49.843 --> 50:53.841
- It's just that I can't explain it.
- What's holding you back?

50:53.972 --> 50:56.131
I mean, it's that, isn't it?

50:56.266 --> 51:00.596
Why does that big mountain
have so much hold over you?

51:00.729 --> 51:02.806
What is it that goes on in there?

51:20.500 --> 51:23.454
<i>How lovely she looks, my darling,</i>

51:23.586 --> 51:28.877
<i>on her way to her last brief
sleep before awakening.</i>

51:29.008 --> 51:33.006
<i>She shall rest where
none can find her.</i>

52:07.715 --> 52:16.422
<i>I am protecting you, Victoria,
from those who would discover us.</i>

52:16.557 --> 52:22.061
<i>I shall eliminate
them all, one by one.</i>

52:23.063 --> 52:24.723
<i>Yes,</i>

52:24.857 --> 52:32.105
<i>even Biederbeck himself,
if need be, my beloved.</i>

52:33.782 --> 52:41.078
<i>In this secret compartment, made
by artisans millenniums ago,</i>

52:41.207 --> 52:45.370
<i>you shall rest like
the princess you are.</i>

52:45.503 --> 52:48.837
<i>For when the moon next comes full,</i>

52:48.965 --> 52:56.012
<i>the waters of the Nile and the tides
within the seas will somehow meet,</i>

52:56.139 --> 53:03.186
<i>and life will flow within your
veins and love within our hearts.</i>

53:10.737 --> 53:15.446
Er, we've got enough trouble around
here without you dreaming up more.

53:15.575 --> 53:19.443
That kind of trouble
I can take any time.

53:19.579 --> 53:22.414
Yes, well. She belongs
to Biederbeck.

53:23.416 --> 53:26.916
- Don't we all?
- Yes. But some more than others.

53:27.045 --> 53:31.173
As you have nothing better to do,
perhaps you'll unload the other truck.

53:31.299 --> 53:33.339
Er, what truck?

53:34.636 --> 53:36.676
Hackett's truck.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.695
Get a good night's sleep.

53:57.827 --> 54:01.326
You still haven't told me
what you expect to find.

54:01.456 --> 54:05.453
- Tomorrow.
- Now, Darius. I'd like to know now.

54:06.002 --> 54:08.244
Tomorrow.

55:54.237 --> 55:57.606
What the hell's going on?!

56:01.745 --> 56:03.571
You're mad.

56:07.917 --> 56:09.957
You're bloody mad!

56:11.921 --> 56:15.006
For God's sake, man, I'll die!

56:46.207 --> 56:52.625
<i>If music be the food
of love... play on...</i>

57:42.055 --> 57:45.009
<i>Give me excess of it...</i>

57:45.142 --> 57:47.134
<i>No.</i>

57:50.480 --> 57:54.146
Here with a loaf of bread
beneath the bough,

57:54.276 --> 57:58.439
a book of verse, a glass of beer...

57:58.572 --> 58:02.320
That's Omar Khayyám, sir. Yes.

58:05.412 --> 58:09.114
I'm a bit apprehensive
about finding the others.

58:09.250 --> 58:13.497
- Do you think you know where we are?
- Trout, I don't think, I know.

58:13.630 --> 58:17.378
- I don't think you know either, sir.
- Keep your place, Trout.

58:17.508 --> 58:19.548
Sorry, sir.

58:21.346 --> 58:23.385
Now, then.

58:24.849 --> 58:27.636
Cairo is, erm...

58:29.729 --> 58:31.140
over there.

58:31.272 --> 58:35.815
And by the same token,
the Red Sea is over there.

58:35.944 --> 58:37.652
- In that direction...
- Yes?

58:37.779 --> 58:41.563
- England.
- Yeah. Yeah, quite so, sir.

58:41.699 --> 58:46.408
How do we find the mountain range where
Biederbeck and Phibes are headed?

58:46.538 --> 58:51.199
There are times when I worry about you.
All we have to do is to ask someone.

58:51.334 --> 58:54.335
- Out here, sir?
- Why not? Bound to be somebody.

59:01.762 --> 59:05.178
- Ah, there! There's somebody.
- Where, sir?

59:05.307 --> 59:06.387
Erm...

59:06.517 --> 59:10.431
Three dunes east. Hop to it,
man. Start the tank.

59:12.648 --> 59:16.231
- Hackett, I need you.
- What's all this about?

59:16.360 --> 59:18.649
I've sent Baker and
the workmen up there.

59:18.779 --> 59:21.614
- Why are we taking the truck?
- Just get in!

59:21.740 --> 59:26.367
We broke through a wall,
found a gold sarcophagus.

59:27.454 --> 59:33.956
<i>Already, underground
waters have begun to rise.</i>

59:34.086 --> 59:41.252
<i>Somewhere within this maze of
tunnels a new river will crest,</i>

59:41.385 --> 59:44.671
<i>along which we will glide,</i>

59:44.805 --> 59:49.763
<i>through gates which will be
revealed to us, Vulnavia.</i>

59:49.894 --> 59:55.565
<i>The gates which can be unlocked
only with the silver key.</i>

59:55.692 --> 01:00:00.235
<i>Come! I must tell Victoria.</i>

01:00:27.516 --> 01:00:33.388
<i>Those devils! To take from me
the two treasures of my life?!</i>

01:00:33.522 --> 01:00:39.524
<i>I shall get them back.
Who tries to stop me will die!</i>

01:01:09.392 --> 01:01:12.144
It certainly is a remarkable find.

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:15.436
How he knew it was there beats me.
He went straight to it.

01:01:15.565 --> 01:01:19.609
- I think it calls for a celebration.
- Yes. Champagne?

01:01:19.736 --> 01:01:21.775
Yes.

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:31.778
<i>A key!</i>

01:01:31.914 --> 01:01:34.584
<i>Why a key?</i>

01:01:37.962 --> 01:01:42.340
Oh, I don't know, but
something's been biting him.

01:01:43.969 --> 01:01:46.425
Who's this, then?

01:01:59.568 --> 01:02:01.477
Darius.

01:02:01.612 --> 01:02:03.651
Stewart's back.

01:02:03.781 --> 01:02:06.069
Don't let him go away.
I'll be out soon.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.572
He's not going anywhere.

01:02:08.702 --> 01:02:11.573
Please, you must come now.

01:02:15.376 --> 01:02:18.460
I suppose we'd better
take him down.

01:02:26.178 --> 01:02:29.262
Why? I don't understand.

01:02:30.557 --> 01:02:33.428
Who could conceive of such
a bizarre way to kill?

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.354
A man called Phibes, sir.
Dr Anton Phibes.

01:02:39.359 --> 01:02:44.650
<i>They have taken you from
me, my sweet Victoria.</i>

01:02:44.781 --> 01:02:48.992
<i>But fear not, for I
shall recover you,</i>

01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:55.702
<i>and they will suffer for this
outrage with their lives!</i>

01:02:56.334 --> 01:02:58.742
With Stewart, he's
now killed four men.

01:02:58.878 --> 01:03:02.413
- Recently. If you care to go further back...
- Trout.

01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:06.677
Yes, but why? What possible
reason could he have?

01:03:06.803 --> 01:03:08.843
Well, Biederbeck?

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.844
The papyrus.

01:03:12.976 --> 01:03:18.136
If he stole it, it means we have
the same goal, the same purpose.

01:03:18.273 --> 01:03:20.942
- No, that's impossible.
- Impossible?

01:03:21.067 --> 01:03:24.152
Impossible or not, we must
get back to civilisation.

01:03:24.279 --> 01:03:26.984
Yeah, especially the young lady.

01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:33.117
Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Baker, first
thing tomorrow, take Diana out of here.

01:03:33.247 --> 01:03:37.161
- The rest can follow later.
- And your good self, sir?

01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:40.708
There's one thing I
must do before I leave.

01:03:40.838 --> 01:03:46.259
- If you value your life, you'll...
- That's precisely why I'm staying.

01:03:46.385 --> 01:03:48.294
A remarkable man.

01:03:48.429 --> 01:03:52.758
I hardly know him, but I've never met
anyone more completely dedicated.

01:03:52.892 --> 01:03:58.597
That poor girl. What she must have
gone through in the past few days.

01:03:58.731 --> 01:04:02.230
Why the hell did he bring her out?

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:07.688
Curiously enough, I think she was the
reason he came here in the first place.

01:04:08.532 --> 01:04:11.403
- Listen, Diana...
- I'm listening.

01:04:11.535 --> 01:04:14.620
You're my whole life, everything.

01:04:16.248 --> 01:04:19.534
Please, darling, if nothing
else, you must know that.

01:04:19.669 --> 01:04:23.714
I'm beginning to wonder if I
do know anything about you.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.672
I can't tell you any more.
I mean, not that you'd understand.

01:04:27.803 --> 01:04:30.091
But the mountain must
be the key to it.

01:04:30.222 --> 01:04:33.887
Possibly, Trout, but it's
all purely academic.

01:04:34.017 --> 01:04:37.267
Now, we only got as far
as an inner chamber,

01:04:37.396 --> 01:04:40.397
but it looked as though
there's a warren of tunnels.

01:04:40.524 --> 01:04:44.937
Every move I make, this whole affair,
concerns our future together.

01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:50.112
Well, if it's anything like now,
it's going to be pretty awful.

01:04:50.242 --> 01:04:53.196
It won't be. I promise you.

01:04:55.205 --> 01:04:58.740
- It's just that I...
- What? What were going to say?

01:04:58.875 --> 01:05:01.248
- I...
- Say it.

01:05:03.213 --> 01:05:08.089
It's just that these next few hours
are of desperate importance to me.

01:05:08.218 --> 01:05:13.343
This expedition isn't really the reason we
came here, is it? There's something else.

01:05:13.473 --> 01:05:16.725
- We could search the mountain and...
- Search it?

01:05:16.853 --> 01:05:20.103
One needs a warrant to make
a search. You should know that.

01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:21.346
I know, but...

01:05:21.482 --> 01:05:25.611
We can't charge into somebody
else's mountain. This isn't Hyde Park.

01:05:25.737 --> 01:05:27.564
Baker.

01:05:28.656 --> 01:05:33.817
Sleep in the sarcophagus tent tonight. Be
ready to leave in the morning with Diana.

01:06:54.535 --> 01:06:56.611
What is it Shakespeare says, sir?

01:06:56.745 --> 01:07:01.954
Thus unconscious doth make
strange bedfellows of us all.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.576
Don't worry, Trout.

01:07:20.812 --> 01:07:23.683
Do you know what I'm dying for?

01:07:25.025 --> 01:07:26.400
What, sir?

01:07:26.526 --> 01:07:29.729
A nice, big, warm...

01:07:29.863 --> 01:07:31.026
What?

01:07:31.156 --> 01:07:32.864
Glass of milk.

01:07:32.991 --> 01:07:36.194
- Would you like me to get one?
- No. That's all right.

01:07:36.828 --> 01:07:40.577
<i>Dear girl, man the machine.</i>

01:08:32.218 --> 01:08:34.886
What's going on?

01:08:35.638 --> 01:08:37.678
Help. Help!

01:08:37.807 --> 01:08:39.349
Argh!

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.384
Argh!

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.395
Get me out!

01:08:51.404 --> 01:08:53.777
- At least we're sure of one thing.
- Hm?

01:08:53.907 --> 01:08:57.323
- Nothing can happen on a night like this.
- Yes.

01:10:40.516 --> 01:10:43.268
<i>Victoria,</i>

01:10:43.394 --> 01:10:48.103
<i>those who have tried
to take you from me,</i>

01:10:48.733 --> 01:10:53.027
<i>so have they paid
the terrible price.</i>

01:10:55.281 --> 01:10:59.113
<i>This water, placid now,</i>

01:11:00.119 --> 01:11:02.610
<i>is but a calm deception.</i>

01:11:02.747 --> 01:11:10.790
<i>For beneath this mountain,
when moon and water reconcile,</i>

01:11:10.921 --> 01:11:16.129
<i>the secret River of
Life will be revealed.</i>

01:11:23.601 --> 01:11:25.759
<i>The key!</i>

01:11:25.895 --> 01:11:29.181
<i>Where is the key?!</i>

01:11:38.325 --> 01:11:40.364
What's the matter?

01:11:43.789 --> 01:11:45.034
Where's Baker?

01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:52.584
Baker.

01:11:52.714 --> 01:11:54.754
Poor devil.

01:11:55.634 --> 01:11:57.258
Quite.

01:11:57.386 --> 01:12:01.335
He's taken the sarcophagus.
But I still have the key.

01:12:02.432 --> 01:12:05.801
That storm last night, Phibes
must have used that as cover.

01:12:05.936 --> 01:12:09.352
- Used it? He probably summoned it!
- All the Arabs have gone.

01:12:09.481 --> 01:12:14.060
I don't blame them. I say, I don't blame
them! It's the obvious thing to do!

01:12:14.194 --> 01:12:17.645
- I found the truck up by the mountain.
- And the sarcophagus?

01:12:17.781 --> 01:12:20.984
- Oh, well, that's gone.
- Just as I expected.

01:12:22.328 --> 01:12:24.368
But what were they doing there?

01:12:24.497 --> 01:12:28.826
I mean, who drove the truck up there
in the first place? Where's Baker?

01:12:31.379 --> 01:12:33.917
He had a bad night, sir.

01:12:37.468 --> 01:12:40.256
Come along, Biederbeck.

01:12:40.388 --> 01:12:41.966
I'm still staying.

01:12:42.098 --> 01:12:44.221
Look here, I have a responsibility.

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:49.724
You have a moral responsibility but, as far
as I'm concerned, no actual jurisdiction.

01:12:49.856 --> 01:12:52.857
- I'm staying.
- But no one's got the better of Phibes.

01:12:52.984 --> 01:12:57.562
To our knowledge he's already killed
15 men. You can't hope to win.

01:12:57.697 --> 01:13:01.909
Don't speak of hope to me,
Trout. I mean to win.

01:13:02.035 --> 01:13:05.238
Hackett, with Baker gone,
you take Diana out of here.

01:13:05.371 --> 01:13:11.042
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'd
like a word with her before she leaves.

01:13:13.046 --> 01:13:15.917
Darling, would you come with me?

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:22.551
- Hackett, put her suitcase in the truck.
- Come along, Trout. Strike camp.

01:13:22.681 --> 01:13:26.679
Yeah. We ought to get these tents
down too, and be on our way.

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:30.939
What about Baker? Should
we dispose of his body?

01:13:31.065 --> 01:13:34.849
I don't know about his body. We
should give his head a decent burial.

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:20.649
Listen.

01:14:22.784 --> 01:14:25.951
It's the Scottish Fusiliers!

01:14:26.079 --> 01:14:29.495
My God! It makes you
proud to be British.

01:14:29.624 --> 01:14:31.451
Out here? How marvellous!

01:14:31.585 --> 01:14:34.539
Yes, it's probably
some desert patrol.

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:37.957
Britannia's cloak covers a
large section of the globe.

01:14:38.091 --> 01:14:42.718
We must tell them about the others.
I mean, that way, they'll be safe.

01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:45.218
Yes, that's true enough.

01:14:45.348 --> 01:14:48.018
But I mustn't leave you.

01:14:48.143 --> 01:14:50.598
I'll go with you, Mr Hackett.

01:14:50.729 --> 01:14:52.057
What?

01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:55.854
Er, no. No, but you're
absolutely right.

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:04.612
A platoon of that lot ought
to put Phibes in his place.

01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:08.787
Don't go anywhere.

01:17:21.883 --> 01:17:23.258
Hackett!

01:17:23.385 --> 01:17:25.673
He has nothing to say, sir.

01:17:25.804 --> 01:17:29.848
Where's Diana? My God,
Phibes must have her!

01:17:30.225 --> 01:17:32.632
- You've no chance!
- He'll kill you like the others!

01:17:32.769 --> 01:17:36.932
I'm not like the others. Phibes may put
the fear of God in you, but not me.

01:17:37.065 --> 01:17:39.520
Now, stay out of my way!

01:17:39.651 --> 01:17:43.484
Oh, dear, dear, dear. He really
is being a trifle heavy-handed.

01:17:43.614 --> 01:17:48.110
He's being bloody offensive! If it
wasn't for Miss Trowbridge... Come on.

01:17:48.244 --> 01:17:49.952
Biederbeck!

01:17:50.079 --> 01:17:51.953
Wait!

01:17:52.081 --> 01:17:54.121
- After him.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:08.264 --> 01:18:13.258
- Phibes!
- <i>So, we meet at last, Biederbeck.</i>

01:18:13.394 --> 01:18:18.554
- Where is she?
- <i>Waiting. As we all must wait.</i>

01:18:18.691 --> 01:18:22.854
Play your foul games with me. If ever
a man deserves to die, it's you.

01:18:22.987 --> 01:18:27.898
<i>You cannot threaten the
dead with death, my friend.</i>

01:18:28.034 --> 01:18:32.612
<i>Only with life, eternal life.</i>

01:18:32.747 --> 01:18:34.870
So that's it, the key.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.787
- <i>My key.</i>
- No.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.996
I've searched for years.

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:44.591
The Temple of Ibiscus, the River
of Life. It's mine, Phibes!

01:18:44.718 --> 01:18:51.848
<i>Then your beloved will die, for
only the key can save her now.</i>

01:18:52.809 --> 01:18:56.392
You lie. The key controls
the gates, nothing more.

01:18:56.521 --> 01:19:03.235
<i>The key controls the gates and much
more... the life of your Diana.</i>

01:19:03.362 --> 01:19:07.822
<i>And you have only three
minutes to use it.</i>

01:19:08.867 --> 01:19:14.110
<i>Now... save your Diana.</i>

01:19:35.436 --> 01:19:37.263
Diana!

01:19:39.732 --> 01:19:40.977
Diana!

01:20:06.676 --> 01:20:11.219
<i>Observe, my sweet Victoria,</i>

01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:17.258
<i>that as the sacred
waters drain away</i>

01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:25.190
<i>the final revelation is before
us... the gates to eternity.</i>

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:32.118
<i>Go, Vulnavia,</i>

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:39.741
<i>and let our victim know the
full measure of our wrath!</i>

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.805
What an amazing thing.

01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:00.557
Don't do that.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.978
- Sir?
- Fellow's toenail.

01:22:03.295 --> 01:22:06.379
What we really need, sir, is a ram.

01:22:12.263 --> 01:22:13.306
Yes.

01:22:16.601 --> 01:22:21.595
<i>You have so little
time, Biederbeck.</i>

01:22:21.731 --> 01:22:26.808
- What kind of fiend are you?
- <i>The kind that wins, my friend.</i>

01:22:26.944 --> 01:22:30.444
<i>It is a pity, in a way.</i>

01:22:30.573 --> 01:22:33.907
<i>We have so much in common.</i>

01:22:34.535 --> 01:22:38.747
- You flatter yourself.
- <i>I think not.</i>

01:22:38.873 --> 01:22:43.914
<i>For years I have had</i>
one terrible obsession...

01:22:44.045 --> 01:22:47.212
<i>to find the River of Life.</i>

01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:51.384
<i>Once used by the Pharaohs of Egypt,</i>

01:22:51.511 --> 01:22:56.089
<i>it lies beyond those gates.</i>

01:22:56.224 --> 01:23:00.008
<i>A river that gives new life,</i>

01:23:00.144 --> 01:23:04.854
<i>again and again and again.</i>

01:23:04.983 --> 01:23:11.520
- Why do you think I came here?
- <i>You have all the life you need.</i>

01:23:11.657 --> 01:23:16.817
No more, Phibes. The elixir that
gave me youth for 100 years is gone.

01:23:16.954 --> 01:23:22.244
This vial, this vial has sustained me
for many years, suspended time and age.

01:23:22.376 --> 01:23:25.827
- But no more.
- <i>How long?</i>

01:23:25.963 --> 01:23:28.086
<i>How many years?</i>

01:23:28.215 --> 01:23:32.082
Too long to remember. Too long
to throw it all away now.

01:23:32.219 --> 01:23:36.596
<i>I, too, have searched, Biederbeck,</i>

01:23:36.724 --> 01:23:40.721
<i>but not for myself.</i>

01:23:40.853 --> 01:23:43.604
<i>For my Victoria.</i>

01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:48.476
<i>I offer you the same goal...</i>

01:23:49.153 --> 01:23:52.818
<i>the life of your beloved.</i>

01:23:52.948 --> 01:23:56.199
<i>But hurry.</i>

01:23:56.328 --> 01:24:00.574
<i>When the bough breaks, my friend...</i>

01:24:00.707 --> 01:24:03.957
It could be a trick. Why should
I trust you, of all people?

01:24:04.085 --> 01:24:11.381
<i>Not me. The ancient artisans
who built these chambers.</i>

01:24:12.177 --> 01:24:18.974
<i>When those gates are unlocked, the
waters from Diana's pool will drain out</i>

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.140
<i>and she will be free.</i>

01:24:21.269 --> 01:24:24.603
<i>Save her. Don't be a fool!</i>

01:24:25.815 --> 01:24:28.982
<i>Soon it will be too late!</i>

01:24:29.694 --> 01:24:33.063
- For whom?
- <i>For us all.</i>

01:24:33.198 --> 01:24:36.531
<i>Especially Diana.</i>

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:43.742
<i>Every second brings her
closer to a terrible death.</i>

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:48.585
<i>Can you pay that price, Biederbeck?</i>

01:24:50.299 --> 01:24:52.422
<i>The key!</i>

01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:06.143
- The devil take you, Phibes.
- <i>The devil take me?</i>

01:25:06.941 --> 01:25:13.394
<i>Not for some considerable
time, I trust.</i>

01:25:51.570 --> 01:25:57.157
Now, if Biederbeck went through there
and he was running pretty fast...

01:25:57.284 --> 01:25:59.775
- Well, I'll be blowed!
- And then...

01:25:59.912 --> 01:26:04.538
Now wait a minute. Phibes must be out
first, otherwise we would have...

01:26:04.666 --> 01:26:07.501
Yes, I think...
I think I've got it.

01:26:27.105 --> 01:26:30.889
- We'll get her out all right.
- Phibes has finally failed, eh?

01:26:31.026 --> 01:26:33.065
No. He's won.

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:38.030
Come on, Trout.

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:52.706
<i>Come, Vulnavia, your work is done.</i>

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.877
<i>Join us on the other side.</i>

01:26:57.053 --> 01:26:59.342
What's that?

01:27:03.601 --> 01:27:04.930
Nothing.

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.052
Phibes!

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:09.015
Wait!

01:27:16.322 --> 01:27:17.781
Phibes!

01:27:18.825 --> 01:27:20.948
Phibes!

01:27:21.077 --> 01:27:24.161
Phibes, I beg you,
let me come with you!

01:27:28.084 --> 01:27:30.161
Phibes, for once have mercy!

01:27:31.706 --> 01:27:35.212
Don't worry, darling. It's
not the end of the world.

01:27:35.897 --> 01:27:41.318
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i>

01:27:41.444 --> 01:27:45.738
<i>Bluebirds fly</i>

01:27:47.909 --> 01:27:52.737
<i>Birds fly over the rainbow</i>

01:27:52.872 --> 01:27:56.372
<i>Why, oh, why can't I?</i>
