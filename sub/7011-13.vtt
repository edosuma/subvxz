WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.371
Hey, guys,
guess what I got.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.305
V.D.?

00:11.344 --> 00:13.278
No.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.280
A hundred bucks.

00:15.348 --> 00:19.307
So... money to treat
your V.D.?

00:19.386 --> 00:21.616
No. My grandmother
gave me this money.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.782
See, my mom told her
that she needed to bleach her whiskers...

00:24.858 --> 00:28.294
and I was like, I go,
"What whiskers?"

00:28.361 --> 00:31.797
Which is a total lie,
'cause she's got these honkin' whiskers.

00:31.865 --> 00:36.996
But then it made her so happy
she gave me a hundred bucks.

00:37.070 --> 00:40.597
Uh, no offense, Michael, but your mom's
not one to talk. I mean... Whoo!

00:42.809 --> 00:44.970
Hey! My mother
is a beautiful woman.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.809
- Apologize.
- Sorry.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.543
- She's nice.
- Whisker face.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.551
All right, thank you.

00:52.619 --> 00:55.315
Now we gotta go celebrate
this hundred bucks.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.322
Let's all go out to dinner...

00:57.390 --> 00:59.551
Someplace expensive.
Someplace nice.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.594
Let's go to the Vineyard.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.720
My new lady love, Caroline,
works there.

01:03.797 --> 01:07.028
Caroline from the concert?
Have you guys gone out again?

01:07.100 --> 01:10.126
- No.
- So, have you guys hung out at school?

01:10.203 --> 01:13.138
- No.
- Talked on the phone?

01:13.206 --> 01:15.140
No.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.540
Have you had any contact
with her at all?

01:17.610 --> 01:19.669
No.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.044
- So Caroline's your new lady?
- Yes.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.639
- That's great.
- Thank you.

01:31.858 --> 01:35.760
There she is.
Isn't she lovely?

01:35.829 --> 01:39.390
She reminds me of that song
"Isn't She Lovely?"

01:39.466 --> 01:41.400
Here she comes.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.333
Here she comes.
Watch me impress her.

01:43.403 --> 01:48.500
- Hi, Fez.
- Hello, Caroline.

01:48.575 --> 01:52.170
- I just came over to say hi.
- Hi.

01:52.245 --> 01:56.045
- Hi! Bye.
- Bye.

01:59.385 --> 02:02.218
Did you see how I played her?

02:04.357 --> 02:06.917
- Hey, Kelso, thanks for dinner. It was great.
- Yeah, it was delicious.

02:06.993 --> 02:10.086
Hey, guys, no need to thank me.
I'm happy to do it.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.533
Okay.

02:14.601 --> 02:17.968
Everybody ready?

02:18.037 --> 02:20.562
Uh, don't you
have to pay first?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.370
- I'm not paying.
- What?

02:23.443 --> 02:26.412
What, did you think
I was paying?

02:26.479 --> 02:29.937
- Yes. Kelso, we don't have any money.
- You don't need any.

02:30.016 --> 02:34.646
People, we are on
a "dine and dash" here.

02:34.721 --> 02:37.656
Oh, yeah. 'Cause the only thing
better than eating lobster...

02:37.724 --> 02:40.750
is eating lobster
and hauling ass.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.955
Let's haul ass.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.471 --> 03:28.099
Kelso, what the hell
are you thinking?

03:28.174 --> 03:30.438
You said you'd
take care of it.

03:30.510 --> 03:36.039
And I took care of it...
by planning the "dine and dash."

03:36.115 --> 03:38.310
Kelso, we're not doing it.

03:38.384 --> 03:42.821
Why not? Guys, we're making
memories here.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.924
Kelso, it's wrong.

03:45.992 --> 03:50.258
Wrong? Or hilarious?

03:50.330 --> 03:53.822
Wrong, you dill-hole.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.959
Or hilariously wrong.

03:56.035 --> 03:57.969
I like it.

03:58.037 --> 04:00.505
But then again,
I'm from the underbelly of society, so...

04:00.573 --> 04:03.007
Uh, yes, excuse me.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.568
Um, would you please send
your finest imported beer to Caroline...

04:06.646 --> 04:09.080
and tell her
that when I said "Hi"...

04:09.148 --> 04:13.278
what I meant was,
"I'll take you like a stallion."

04:16.255 --> 04:19.156
You got that?
Like a stallion?

04:21.827 --> 04:24.592
Fez, stop ordering stuff.

04:24.664 --> 04:27.258
Okay, you need
to chill out, little girl.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.267
Didn't you hear Kelso?

04:29.335 --> 04:34.170
The Vineyard is having a dine-and-dash
promotion. Everything is free.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.435
It's not free, Fez.

04:36.509 --> 04:39.205
"Dine and dash" is when
you run out without paying.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.818
So it's stealing?

04:49.022 --> 04:51.684
This isn't going to help me
with Caroline, is it?

04:53.559 --> 04:56.221
Excuse me.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.905
Hey!

05:19.986 --> 05:23.444
That's from me,
you son of a bitch.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.955
Oh, good, honey, you're home.
Listen.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.760
The Pinciottis called.
They wanted to have card night tonight, so...

05:33.833 --> 05:36.529
No, Kitty, you just
call them back, 'cause...

05:36.602 --> 05:38.695
there's no way in hell that
I'm gonna have card night...

05:38.771 --> 05:42.605
with the Pinciottis
'cause it's just too much fun.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.473
Hello, Bob and Midge.

05:45.545 --> 05:48.013
- What the hell are they doing here?
- I don't know.

05:50.016 --> 05:54.350
So! Who else needs
a drink real bad?

05:54.420 --> 05:56.718
Tough day
at the salt mines, Red?

05:56.789 --> 06:01.351
Oh. When did you get a job
at the salt mines?

06:03.129 --> 06:06.030
Here, honey.
Play with these.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.033
Yeah...

06:08.101 --> 06:10.228
workin' Joe.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.737
I'll tell ya.
Since my business went bankrupt...

06:12.805 --> 06:15.239
I got a lot of free time.

06:15.308 --> 06:18.277
I mainly use it
to nap and cry.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.413
Well, uh, Bob...

06:21.481 --> 06:23.415
don't cry on the cards.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.781
It makes 'em hard to shuffle.

06:30.790 --> 06:34.920
Michael, I have never dined and dashed,
and I'm not about to start now.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.087
Uh, well...

06:38.164 --> 06:40.098
Remember when we went
to nice restaurants...

06:40.166 --> 06:42.600
and I told you to wait
in the car while I paid?

06:42.668 --> 06:46.866
Did you ever wonder why
I was running to the car?

06:48.674 --> 06:51.404
Oh, my God.
I'm a thief.

06:51.477 --> 06:54.503
I think technically
you're an accessory.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.707
Which should make you happy,
because you love accessories...

06:56.783 --> 07:00.617
- earrings, bracelets, bangles, bows...
- Shut up!

07:02.555 --> 07:06.047
So, did you enjoy your pilsner?

07:06.125 --> 07:09.219
Did you get the message
about the stallion?

07:11.130 --> 07:15.396
Okay, look, okay? You can't send beer
to the hostess podium, okay?

07:15.468 --> 07:20.337
I almost got fired.
So just pretend you don't know me, okay?

07:20.406 --> 07:22.533
I don't think I do know you,
Caroline.

07:28.981 --> 07:32.610
Caroline has upset me.

07:32.685 --> 07:36.587
I can't wait
to dine and dash on her ass...

07:36.656 --> 07:38.817
her beautiful ass.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.252
- I'll go first.
- Hyde, we're not doing this.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.560
And especially not you,
'cause you're on probation.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.623
- So what?
- So what?

07:48.701 --> 07:51.135
You get caught, you go to jail,
and I've heard nothing good about jail.

07:51.204 --> 07:55.004
I haven't done one stinkin' illegal thing
since I got probation.

07:55.074 --> 07:58.441
So, what, you're mad because you haven't
committed any crimes since your last crime?

07:58.511 --> 08:01.002
Yeah, so I'm going.

08:27.974 --> 08:32.707
Can I help you?

09:00.206 --> 09:03.175
- What happened?
- This place is like Alcatraz, man.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.335
There's no way out.

09:06.712 --> 09:12.207
So it was either a U.F.O.
Or I rubbed my eyes too hard.

09:16.289 --> 09:20.055
Okay. Good story, Midge.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.094
So, Red, how's work?

09:22.161 --> 09:25.062
Well, yesterday I hired some new guy
down in sporting goods...

09:25.131 --> 09:28.396
- but I don't know...
- Whoa. You hired a new guy?

09:30.469 --> 09:32.403
Oh, that's funny.

09:32.471 --> 09:36.407
I remember when I was doing the hiring
at my store, and you were out of work.

09:36.475 --> 09:38.568
I hired you...

09:38.644 --> 09:40.942
neighbor.

09:41.013 --> 09:44.039
- Listen, Bob...
- No. Midgie?

09:44.116 --> 09:46.744
- We're going home.
- But I have gin.

09:46.819 --> 09:49.379
We're playing bridge!

09:51.891 --> 09:54.018
I can't do it.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.220
I've gone soft, man.
I'm like Forman.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.791
It sickens me.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.767
Mm. So you can't do it.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.770
I wonder why.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.272
- Why, oh, why?
- Oh! I know why.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.275
- Yes, Donna?
- Because it's wrong.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.972
That's right, Miss Pinciotti.
It's wrong.

10:14.046 --> 10:18.039
Gee, what a surprise...
Mom and Dad don't want to do it.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.051
We are not Mom and Dad.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.611
And we're not leaving
without paying, young man.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.123
Fine. Fine.
I'll pay for the stupid dinner.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.126
Now just give me
your stupid keys...

10:28.194 --> 10:30.662
so I can get my money
out of your stupid car.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.664
Stupid.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.795
I don't care if you're
in the freakin' Olympics...

10:36.869 --> 10:38.803
about to run the freakin'
hundred-yard dash...

10:38.871 --> 10:40.805
If someone sends you a beer,
you say thank you...

10:40.873 --> 10:43.706
and drink the freakin' beer.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.645
Um, Eric?

10:47.713 --> 10:49.647
Did Kelso leave
his money at home?

10:49.715 --> 10:52.980
- 'Cause he just drove away in the Vista Cruiser.
- What?

10:53.052 --> 10:55.953
No. No, he wouldn't ditch us.

10:56.022 --> 10:59.389
Are you sure?
'Cause as he drove past he was doing this...

11:04.664 --> 11:07.428
No. Donna, he's kidding.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.468
He wouldn't ditch us.

11:09.535 --> 11:12.698
He ditched us!

11:12.772 --> 11:15.434
I'm sure he's right outside.
I'll go get him.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.806
- Fez, I don't know.
- Don't worry.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.811
I'll go and get the money
and come back.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.813
You can trust me.

11:26.118 --> 11:30.987
- He's not coming back!
- And we trusted him.

11:31.057 --> 11:34.185
Foreigners lie.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.956
You know what?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.692
I'm just gonna call my dad,
and he'll come pay for our dinner.

11:40.766 --> 11:43.667
Okay, but, Jackie,
if you don't come back...

11:43.736 --> 11:47.604
Eric, please. I'm not immature
like those idiots.

11:51.243 --> 11:54.679
She is immature
like those idiots!

11:54.747 --> 11:57.375
I can't believe
I got stuck here with the squares.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.418
We're not squares!

11:59.485 --> 12:01.419
Donna, settle down.

12:01.487 --> 12:05.355
You don't want
to upset your stomach.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.594
This is bad, man.

12:09.662 --> 12:13.928
If I'm not fighting against the system,
I <i>am</i> the system.

12:13.999 --> 12:18.026
Screw it. I'm going.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.231
Banzai!

12:29.949 --> 12:32.144
Okay, I can
take the check now.

12:32.218 --> 12:35.244
Or whenever... or now.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.619
Uh...

12:37.690 --> 12:40.352
Two more bananas Foster,
please.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.954
Eric, what are you doing?

12:45.031 --> 12:48.057
I'm stalling.
They'll come back.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.637
Joke's over, you know?

12:52.705 --> 12:56.971
Best thing about this joke,
it just keeps going and going.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.307
And not only
did we break the law...

12:59.379 --> 13:03.110
we screwed our friends
while breaking the law.

13:03.182 --> 13:08.245
How dumb was he
to give me the car keys?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.414
I mean,
who here trusts me?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.424
- <i>No way.</i>
- <i>Not me.</i>

13:12.492 --> 13:14.426
Thank you.

13:14.494 --> 13:18.430
You know what?
Stolen food just tastes better.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.432
Dinner roll?

13:23.169 --> 13:25.103
Guys, I feel bad
about Eric and Donna.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.765
Maybe we should figure out
a way to help them.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.274
Sure, we could do that.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.777
Or...

13:32.845 --> 13:36.246
we could ask ourselves,
"How can we make this worse?"

13:36.315 --> 13:39.443
Happy anniversary
Happy anniversary

13:39.519 --> 13:42.784
<i>Happy anniversary</i>
<i>Donna and Eric</i>

13:42.855 --> 13:46.313
With best wishes from Hyde,
Kelso, Fez and Jackie.

13:57.370 --> 14:01.204
- Oh, this is just terrible.
- Oh, Kitty.

14:01.274 --> 14:05.768
Quincy's no Columbo,
but he's still pretty good.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.508
Red, Bob was very upset
when he left here.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.516
Bob's always upset.

14:11.584 --> 14:15.543
He's a little girl
in big boy pants.

14:15.621 --> 14:19.250
Well, why didn't you
offer him a job?

14:19.325 --> 14:23.318
I didn't want to insult him
by offering him some nothing job.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.297
Oh, Red, you insult him
every day.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.993
But that's different.
He thinks I'm kidding.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.600
Kitty, this is about
a man's dignity.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.674
Oh, sure, it was...

14:36.742 --> 14:39.768
It was awful, what happened.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.872
But let's just
put it behind us...

14:42.949 --> 14:44.974
and watch <i>Quincy.</i>

14:47.253 --> 14:49.187
Hey!

14:49.255 --> 14:52.782
Oh, come on, Red.
How bad would it be working with Bob?

14:52.859 --> 14:55.259
It's a big store.
You'd hardly ever see him.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.855
Maybe you could...
You could hide from him.

15:00.933 --> 15:03.561
He'd find me.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.571
He always finds me.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.733
Well, you better
think of something...

15:09.809 --> 15:14.405
because they are gonna live next door
to us for a long, long time.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.074
You don't know that.

15:17.149 --> 15:20.084
He's out of work.
He'll probably lose the house.

15:25.157 --> 15:27.250
Fine. I'll talk to Bob.

15:27.326 --> 15:30.420
But you gotta work
on your sense of humor, lady.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.261
Man, I can't believe
those guys screwed us like this.

15:35.334 --> 15:38.770
- Well, at least we still have each other.
- You know what? You're right.

15:38.838 --> 15:42.467
I can't count on much in this crazy world,
but I can always count on you.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.102
That is so true.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.338
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.643
Hey!

15:51.017 --> 15:54.453
Why don't you just
sit your lyin' ass down?

15:57.189 --> 15:59.885
Eric, don't you trust me?

16:01.961 --> 16:05.453
Not as far as I can throw you,
and that ain't far.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.398
How can you say that?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.732
Okay, so I noticed the fire exit
was next to the bathroom.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.238
Doesn't mean I'd use it.
I happened to notice it, that's all.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.968
It's very convenient.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.210
Donna, don't you see
what's happening?

16:19.278 --> 16:22.076
They've turned us
against each other.

16:22.148 --> 16:27.848
You're right.
I <i>was</i> gonna use the fire exit. I was!

16:27.920 --> 16:30.912
You know why they do this?
Because they know we won't get them back.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.754
We're responsible,
mature "Mom and Dad."

16:33.826 --> 16:36.294
We just...
We won't stoop to their level.

16:36.362 --> 16:39.195
Well, damn it, let's stoop to their level
or an even lower level.

16:39.265 --> 16:42.234
Yeah. Oh, I'm with you,
baby, yeah.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.264
There's just one problem.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.832
We can't do it from in here.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.615
If I don't make it...

16:57.683 --> 17:00.208
tell Mama I'm sorry.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.220
Don't talk like that.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.449
You'll tell her yourself.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.411
Hey, Bob.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.640
So, taking out
your trash, huh?

17:28.714 --> 17:32.480
No, Red,
I'm bringing it back in.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.922
Yeah, Bob.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.925
That's a good one.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.053
Listen, I want to offer you
a job at Price Mart.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.099
- Geez, Red, Price Mart?
- What?

17:47.166 --> 17:51.159
Yeah, that may be fine for you, but you're
talking to a guy who owned his own business.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.673
And ran it into the ground.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.300
Okay, I'm, uh...

17:57.376 --> 17:59.606
I'm sorry.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.544
Just take the job, Bob.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.208
- No.
- Okay.

18:04.283 --> 18:07.719
That's fine, Bob. There is no job.
Forget it.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.813
Oh, so now you're <i>not</i>
offering me a job.

18:10.890 --> 18:15.384
I just offered you the job,
and you said you didn't want the job.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.402
Well, ask me again.

18:26.806 --> 18:30.503
Oh, cripes.

18:30.576 --> 18:33.909
You want a job
at Price Mart, Bob?

18:34.980 --> 18:36.971
I'll think about it.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.945
Go to hell, Bob!

18:44.990 --> 18:47.584
Okay, you guys. Okay.
Good one last night.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.924
You know, ditching us
at the restaurant and everything.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.190
Yeah, we got you
so bad.

18:52.264 --> 18:56.598
You really did.
We laughed and laughed.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.603
To show you guys
we're such good sports...

18:58.671 --> 19:01.037
we made you guys a batch
of special brownies.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.838
Special brownies.
Like the <i>special</i> kind of special?

19:04.910 --> 19:07.344
The best kind of special.

19:11.717 --> 19:15.016
Something's wrong.
I don't feel special.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.453
Me neither.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.083
Yeah, I don't think those
were special brownies, man.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.719
Oh, no, no.
They're special.

19:22.795 --> 19:26.424
Say, Donna, do you have any more
of that <i>special</i> ingredient we used?

19:26.499 --> 19:30.492
Well, I certainly do, Eric.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.901
Chocolate Super-Lax.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.443
- You didn't.
- We did.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.710
We so did. Now maybe
you'll think twice before screwing us.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.149
Well, nice try, 'cause I don't feel any...

20:06.338 --> 20:08.704
Oh, no. I am last.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.044
- Ay, no!
- I know.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.843
You're surprised to see me, right?
And upset.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.113
- Yes, many things are upset.
- Okay, listen.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.620
Okay, listen, Fez.
About last night...

20:22.688 --> 20:25.589
I know you were angry,
and you have every right to be.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.592
But you know
what this was?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.594
- Our first fight.
- Oh!

20:29.662 --> 20:32.130
And it made us a real couple...
if you can forgive me.

20:32.198 --> 20:36.692
- Fine. Move away from the door.
- So we're okay?

20:36.769 --> 20:41.172
Good. Now let's make up like a real couple.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.969
You bastards!

20:46.045 --> 20:48.104
Wait, Fez!
Wait up!

20:55.554 --> 20:58.648
Okay, you guys.

20:58.724 --> 21:03.024
That was a wicked burn.

21:04.797 --> 21:10.497
It had all the elements: You didn't see
it coming, parts of it really hurt...

21:14.840 --> 21:17.240
Well, Kelso,
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.539
Oh, I did.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.951
I got my eye on you two.

21:29.021 --> 21:32.650
You're not gonna burn me
like that again.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.888
- I love our friends.
- Me too.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.201
Hey, Red.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.203
I've been thinking
about your offer...

21:45.271 --> 21:47.739
and I want you to know,
I made a decision.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.741
Oh, goody.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.607
But I need you
to ask me again.

21:56.382 --> 21:58.646
Bob, would you, uh...

21:58.717 --> 22:01.413
like a job at Price Mart?

22:01.487 --> 22:04.320
Say it like you mean it.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.655
Go to hell, Bob!
