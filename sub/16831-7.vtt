WEBVTT

00:03.648 --> 00:05.515
You just had to build
a fire, didn't you?

00:05.550 --> 00:07.184
How was I supposed
to know they'd see it?

00:07.218 --> 00:09.179
You do know fire makes light, right?

00:12.324 --> 00:13.391
Arrêtez!

00:44.456 --> 00:46.057
- Oui.
- Adieu.

00:49.695 --> 00:52.992
I think that's Lieutenant Louis Coulon.

00:53.732 --> 00:55.099
He's the only man George Washington

00:55.134 --> 00:57.031
- has ever surrendered to. He...
- No. No history.

00:57.056 --> 00:58.257
Not right now.

01:02.207 --> 01:03.710
Hey.

01:03.735 --> 01:05.585
Careful with that.

01:06.045 --> 01:08.613
- He doesn't speak English.
- I don't care.

01:08.647 --> 01:12.550
Okay. Okay. Obviously, the
situation is not ideal...

01:12.584 --> 01:14.752
Not ideal is having french
fries without ketchup.

01:14.787 --> 01:17.689
This has been three days
of trudging through the mud,

01:17.723 --> 01:19.223
bitten by bugs I can't identify,

01:19.258 --> 01:20.990
eating meat I don't want to identify...

01:21.015 --> 01:22.256
Three days of listening to you whine.

01:22.281 --> 01:23.761
- Hey. Come on.
- Really, G.I. Joe?

01:23.787 --> 01:26.530
I don't like it either but,
Flynn is still out here somewhere,

01:26.564 --> 01:28.351
and if we're gonna find him, we're
gonna have to work together, okay?

01:28.376 --> 01:30.945
Work together? Really?
'Cause Rufus is over there...

01:30.970 --> 01:32.078
Hey!

01:32.841 --> 01:35.209
... recording us for Rittenhouse.

01:35.407 --> 01:38.242
Yeah, we're really working
together, aren't we?

01:45.139 --> 01:47.685
How do you say, "I had sex
with your mother" in French?

01:47.710 --> 01:49.454
You don't, unless you're trying
to get us killed right now.

01:49.488 --> 01:51.656
I'm trying to do my job.

01:59.298 --> 02:02.403
J'ai couchée avec ta mère.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.247
Hey, Pierre.

02:10.271 --> 02:12.844
J'ai couchée avec ta mère.

02:15.848 --> 02:17.786
Très bien, you son of a bitch.

02:55.821 --> 02:58.407
Oh, hey, I forgot.
Hand me that recorder.

03:03.259 --> 03:05.165
There. Now we can say
whatever the hell we want.

03:05.190 --> 03:06.319
Wha...

03:07.032 --> 03:08.633
What am I supposed to say to Mason?

03:08.667 --> 03:10.001
Tell him you lost it.

03:10.035 --> 03:11.569
And you think he's just gonna buy that?

03:11.603 --> 03:13.055
I don't know.

03:13.705 --> 03:16.307
You know, we still haven't even
figured out why Flynn's here.

03:16.341 --> 03:17.642
I don't know. It's hard to say.

03:17.676 --> 03:19.310
Basically, the French and Indian War

03:19.344 --> 03:22.602
was the French with their Indian
allies fighting the British.

03:22.627 --> 03:25.049
A 22-year-old George Washington
was fighting for England.

03:25.084 --> 03:27.018
So this is about young
George Washington?

03:27.052 --> 03:29.821
Or maybe Flynn wants to
change the outcome of the war?

03:29.855 --> 03:32.523
So, what? We become
United States of France?

03:32.558 --> 03:34.445
Lots of attitude, no one
picks up their dog poop?

03:34.470 --> 03:35.837
Hey.

03:35.862 --> 03:37.626
What, did you write a book
on France or something?

03:37.651 --> 03:40.431
Whatever Flynn was gonna do,
he's probably already done it.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.623
That's comforting.

03:47.606 --> 03:49.240
Place them all around.

03:54.813 --> 03:57.048
Hey, I need more over here.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.772
It's Flynn's guys.

04:07.529 --> 04:09.197
- Is that...
- ... C4.

04:10.129 --> 04:12.130
Okay. Stand clear.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.476
No!

04:36.488 --> 04:39.000
Rufus! Hey!

04:39.691 --> 04:42.059
- What the hell are you doing?
- That was our ride!

04:42.094 --> 04:45.445
The Mothership's our last chance
to get back to the 21st century!

05:07.152 --> 05:08.703
Wyatt, get down.

05:08.728 --> 05:11.023
If you don't let go,
you're going to die!

05:29.886 --> 05:31.653
We're trapped here.

05:35.411 --> 05:39.097

05:42.238 --> 05:44.439
Jacques? Jacques!

05:44.473 --> 05:45.940
No, no.

06:01.964 --> 06:04.432
So you think Flynn's plan
wasn't to change history?

06:04.466 --> 06:06.301
It was to trap us here?

06:06.335 --> 06:08.322
- In 1754?
- That'd be my guess.

06:08.347 --> 06:09.604
While we were out looking for him,

06:09.638 --> 06:11.026
his guys were looking for the Lifeboat.

06:11.051 --> 06:13.508
It'd be smart. I can't imagine
a worse place to strand us.

06:13.542 --> 06:16.177
300 miles from anywhere, in
an era full of hostile forces

06:16.211 --> 06:19.103
- and, you know, smallpox.
- Amazing.

06:32.795 --> 06:34.095
Come on.

06:34.129 --> 06:36.197
You have to talk to me at some point.

06:36.231 --> 06:37.733
What do you call this?

06:37.758 --> 06:40.536
Look, I-I will say it again,
and I will keep saying it.

06:40.569 --> 06:42.437
I'm sorry for not telling
you about the journal.

06:42.471 --> 06:44.733
What about your little
deal with Agent Christopher?

06:45.280 --> 06:47.041
When were you gonna tell me about that?

06:47.076 --> 06:48.732
Yeah, Christopher told me.

06:48.757 --> 06:50.880
So I kill Flynn, she helps
you get your sister back.

06:50.905 --> 06:52.872
Nothing about me or my wife, but, hey,

06:52.897 --> 06:55.147
as long as you get what you need.

06:55.172 --> 06:56.951
Okay, that is not
fair. It is not a secret

06:56.986 --> 06:58.747
that I'm trying to get my sister back.

06:58.772 --> 07:01.139
I mean, you were the one that said,
"Figure out what you're fighting for."

07:01.164 --> 07:02.561
Well, I am fighting for Amy,

07:02.586 --> 07:04.749
and you of all people
should understand that.

07:06.015 --> 07:07.881
Okay.

07:08.351 --> 07:10.052
Rufus, where are we?

07:10.086 --> 07:11.553
Well...

07:11.850 --> 07:13.708
aside from the obvious
hole in the side panel,

07:13.733 --> 07:16.036
there is some serious
damage to the circuitry.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.927
I could cannibalize the
wiring from the nav system,

07:18.962 --> 07:21.395
and if I had some iron, maybe
I could patch up the hole,

07:21.420 --> 07:24.716
but our big problem is, we're
short a couple capacitors.

07:24.741 --> 07:26.850
Like a flux capacitor?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.244
No. Those don't exist.

07:29.279 --> 07:31.155
What would it take to
make a real capacitor?

07:31.180 --> 07:33.108
You buy one. From RadioShack.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.083
Come on, Rufus. You
built a time machine.

07:35.118 --> 07:38.936
If you absolutely had to
build a capacitor here, now,

07:38.961 --> 07:40.475
what would it take to build it?

07:40.500 --> 07:41.623
- I'd need foil.
- Okay.

07:41.658 --> 07:43.425
Okay, uh, barring that,

07:43.459 --> 07:46.280
I could hammer some tin or copper,

07:46.305 --> 07:49.741
thinly, maybe, uh, salt,
a couple glass jars...

07:49.766 --> 07:52.342
- Okay. Good. What else?
- Uhm...

07:52.639 --> 07:54.169
I'd need a forge.

07:54.203 --> 07:56.405
And to learn to be a blacksmith.

07:56.439 --> 07:59.408
- And then you'd be able to fix it?
- Probably not.

08:01.311 --> 08:02.945
Maybe.

08:05.124 --> 08:06.702
Okay, look.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.278
We are less than 20
miles from Fort Duquesne.

08:09.311 --> 08:10.733
They probably have some of
the stuff that you need there.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.154
Fort Duquesne?

08:12.179 --> 08:15.157
The fort that the French soldiers came
from, including the one that I killed?

08:15.191 --> 08:17.467
What are we gonna do? Walk
in and ask to borrow a forge?

08:17.492 --> 08:19.660
Either that or we
learn to start farming.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.699
All right. if you can build
this thing, you can get us home?

08:23.733 --> 08:25.367
Haven't even gotten
to the hard part yet.

08:25.401 --> 08:26.530
Oh, good to know.

08:26.555 --> 08:27.967
If we use the wiring
from the nav system,

08:28.015 --> 08:29.795
I won't be able to
control where we land.

08:29.820 --> 08:31.606
Doesn't matter if we
fix the Lifeboat or not.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.674
We'll never survive the trip unless...

08:35.506 --> 08:36.745
protocol.

08:36.779 --> 08:40.100
Protocol? What protocol?

08:51.444 --> 08:54.101
So when exactly did Flynn get the
Mothership back to present day?

08:54.126 --> 08:55.255
Three hours ago.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.716
Usually, our guys come back just
a few minutes after Flynn does.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.147
Well, it could just be a technical
problem with the Lifeboat.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.100
Or something's happened to the team.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.622
Any leads on Flynn?

09:04.850 --> 09:06.366
Yes.

09:06.659 --> 09:09.942
He's in this 50-square-mile
radius near Mexico City.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.664
- How fast can we get a team there?
- It's Mexico. It'll be a minute.

09:12.698 --> 09:14.825
Sir, we don't have a minute.
Any second, Flynn could jump,

09:14.850 --> 09:16.668
and there won't be anyone
there to chase him this time.

09:16.702 --> 09:18.002
I'll get into it.

09:20.106 --> 09:21.473
Don't mean to be insensitive,

09:21.693 --> 09:23.794
but stop moping like a bloody idiot.

09:23.819 --> 09:25.477
- Excuse me?
- Our people are out there.

09:25.502 --> 09:27.616
Get your head in the game,
and let's figure out a way

09:27.641 --> 09:28.747
- to get them back home.
- How? How...

09:28.781 --> 09:31.616
Why do you think we have the protocol?

09:37.623 --> 09:40.472
And you're digging exactly 3 feet
from the front of the Lifeboat?

09:40.497 --> 09:43.729
Yes, I am following your
absurdly specific instruction.

09:46.105 --> 09:48.252
When you said, "Get a
message to Mason Industries,"

09:48.277 --> 09:50.463
I didn't think you literally
meant "in a bottle."

09:50.488 --> 09:51.846
We can't exactly send a text, can we?

09:51.871 --> 09:52.965
Really? This is the best system

09:52.990 --> 09:54.480
that Connor Mason could come up with?

09:54.505 --> 09:57.876
Ah, behold the power of
non-biodegradable polyethylene.

09:57.910 --> 09:59.869
Bit of a future
environmental catastrophe,

09:59.894 --> 10:01.994
but, today, it could save our asses.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.947
- How's that gonna work?
- Connor will fly to this spot

10:03.972 --> 10:06.244
with a team of archaeologists
and dig this up.

10:06.269 --> 10:08.884
We're standing in what's going
to be a suburb of Pittsburgh.

10:08.909 --> 10:12.035
I mean, who knows what could happen
to this patch of land over 260 years.

10:12.060 --> 10:14.487
Yeah, well, that's
why we got to dig deep.

10:15.494 --> 10:17.962
And this system generally works?

10:17.997 --> 10:20.854
Don't know. No one's ever tried it.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.402
- And if it doesn't?
- Then we don't make it home.

10:24.577 --> 10:26.089
Or we die violently.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.269
Or both.

10:44.158 --> 10:47.042
- Connor Mason.
- Your Lifeboat is missing.

10:47.136 --> 10:49.925
- Garcia Flynn is operating unchecked.
- I'm handling it.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.894
We've already bankrolled one machine
that was hijacked by terrorists.

10:52.933 --> 10:54.439
Now we've lost our backup machine.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.892
We've lost Lucy Preston.

10:55.917 --> 10:59.316
We've lost our whole team,
actually, but you only mention Lucy.

10:59.706 --> 11:03.385
Matter of fact, you've mentioned her
a few times now, which I find curious.

11:03.410 --> 11:05.923
Out of all the excellent
historians in the country,

11:05.965 --> 11:08.479
a young untenured professor is chosen

11:08.504 --> 11:11.061
for something this important?

11:11.096 --> 11:12.706
You know, it makes one wonder if...

11:12.731 --> 11:15.463
certain strings weren't
pulled to get Lucy the job.

11:15.534 --> 11:17.267
Also makes me wonder

11:17.302 --> 11:19.612
who could've pulled those strings.

11:19.698 --> 11:21.872
- And why...
- Mr. Mason...

11:21.906 --> 11:24.575
you seem to have forgotten
the nature of our relationship.

11:24.609 --> 11:25.843
Our relationship?

11:25.877 --> 11:27.277
This machine is our relationship.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.346
Without it, and without
all my team back,

11:29.381 --> 11:31.010
we don't have a relationship.

11:31.035 --> 11:32.716
I'll call you when I
have something to report.

11:32.751 --> 11:34.184
My jet is waiting.

11:34.219 --> 11:35.753
What was all that about?

11:36.788 --> 11:38.288
Personal business.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.050
The jet should be ready.

11:43.595 --> 11:45.863
This is all gonna be
downtown Pittsburgh one day.

11:45.897 --> 11:48.597
Concrete as far as the eye can see.

11:49.538 --> 11:51.213
But for now?

11:51.569 --> 11:53.659
It's really beautiful, isn't it?

11:54.072 --> 11:55.706
Super beautiful.

11:55.740 --> 11:57.785
Just wiped my butt with some leaves.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.341
Thank God.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.063
What the hell, man?

12:10.088 --> 12:11.789
You said the red
berries are safe to eat.

12:11.823 --> 12:13.590
The ones that are solo.

12:13.635 --> 12:16.970
When they're a cluster, they
will kill you. I told you that!

12:16.995 --> 12:18.916
Well, I'm sorry. That's confusing.

12:18.941 --> 12:20.666
You realize we are in 1754, right?

12:20.691 --> 12:22.563
There's no ambulance.
There's no antibiotics.

12:22.588 --> 12:24.001
- There's no tetanus shot.
- I get it.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.401
You make one mistake, you'll die.

12:25.437 --> 12:27.799
I get it! I get that I suck at this.

12:27.824 --> 12:29.159
I hate the outdoors!

12:29.184 --> 12:30.588
And-and camping. And bees.

12:30.613 --> 12:32.399
And I really hate this survivalist crap.

12:32.424 --> 12:35.182
- That's why we have you.
- Who do I have, Rufus?

12:37.565 --> 12:38.731
You're Delta Force.

12:38.756 --> 12:41.158
Delta Force isn't a person. It's a team.

12:44.122 --> 12:45.923
I'm just one guy.

12:45.957 --> 12:47.658
If I don't have someone
that I can count on...

12:47.692 --> 12:49.675
I mean really count on...

12:51.186 --> 12:53.417
we're not gonna make it out of here.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.276
Come on.

13:17.555 --> 13:18.989
What is it?

13:19.023 --> 13:20.491
It's the French from last night.

13:20.525 --> 13:21.992
Oh, God.

13:22.026 --> 13:24.035
One guess who they're looking for.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.651
The water will cover our tracks.

13:38.543 --> 13:40.544
Let's go for a swim.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.435
I don't hear anything.
You think we lost 'em?

14:05.470 --> 14:08.442
Yeah, for now, but we got
to keep moving. Come on.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.611
Uh, uh, guys?

14:20.833 --> 14:22.754
Deserter, maybe?

14:26.257 --> 14:27.558
What are you doing?

14:27.592 --> 14:29.565
We're gonna have much better
luck getting into a French fort

14:29.590 --> 14:32.387
if I'm dressed like a French
soldier, don't you think?

14:34.432 --> 14:36.232
This body's still warm.

14:36.734 --> 14:40.653
- Which means he was killed...
- ... Really, really recently.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.093
- What the hell is that?
- Battle cries.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.413
It's what they do when
they take prisoners.

15:13.085 --> 15:14.335
Like us.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.443
So do they scalp you
after they kill you,

15:16.468 --> 15:19.530
or is scalping, like, how they kill you?

15:22.685 --> 15:24.710
- These are Shawnee?
- Yeah.

15:24.735 --> 15:26.521
- And they think we're British?
- Yeah.

15:26.556 --> 15:28.319
And how do the Shawnee
feel about the British?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.858
Depends on the tribe,
depends on the day,

15:29.892 --> 15:30.960
but I think it's safe to say

15:30.985 --> 15:32.374
- they're not fans.
- Yeah.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.609
So we should take it as a positive sign

15:33.634 --> 15:35.179
they haven't tried
to kill us yet, right?

15:35.204 --> 15:37.187
I think they're just
waiting for their chief.

15:40.269 --> 15:42.170
Come on, Wyatt, there's got to be...

15:42.205 --> 15:44.039
a way to get us out of this, right?

15:44.073 --> 15:45.802
You can, just... something.

15:45.827 --> 15:47.804
Unless one of you can barf up a knife,

15:47.829 --> 15:50.297
I think we're gonna be here awhile.

15:53.860 --> 15:56.184
Yeah. As soon as they're
done with the loader...

16:04.757 --> 16:07.028
So how'd you get them to
clear out the whole street?

16:07.063 --> 16:08.421
Told them all we were CDC

16:08.446 --> 16:11.194
and we found Zika mosquitoes
in the neighborhood.

16:11.534 --> 16:13.602
Hey, whatever it takes.

16:13.636 --> 16:15.971
I want to get the team back home too.

16:19.304 --> 16:20.554
You needn't have come out here.

16:20.579 --> 16:22.226
You know I'd have let you
know if we'd found anything.

16:22.251 --> 16:23.765
No, I needed to be here.

16:24.915 --> 16:28.530
It hasn't escaped my notice
that you and Rufus are close.

16:30.253 --> 16:32.487
That's just it. We aren't.

16:34.157 --> 16:36.437
I mean, he asked me out once, but...

16:36.462 --> 16:38.794
most of the time, he just
instant messages me from his desk,

16:38.828 --> 16:41.630
2 feet away from me, instead
of actually talking to me.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.898
I think it would mean a lot to
him to know how worried you are.

16:56.345 --> 16:58.980
You know, if this is really
it, you know, like, really it...

16:59.015 --> 17:01.148
- Don't say that. It's not it.
- Even if we get out of here,

17:01.173 --> 17:04.460
there's no telling if we'll
actually make it out of 1754.

17:05.755 --> 17:07.851
I can't stop thinking...

17:08.352 --> 17:10.632
what I wouldn't give...

17:11.375 --> 17:14.574
for one more Chocodile.

17:16.499 --> 17:18.038
What?

17:18.460 --> 17:21.335
What the hell is a Chocodile?

17:21.359 --> 17:22.771
Twinkie....

17:24.272 --> 17:25.473
covered in chocolate.

17:26.809 --> 17:28.977
Rufus, that is monumentally stupid.

17:29.011 --> 17:31.012
Well, clearly, you've
never had one before.

17:31.047 --> 17:32.086
No.

17:40.723 --> 17:44.226
What I wouldn't give to be able
to tell Jiya how I feel about her.

17:47.844 --> 17:49.874
How do you feel about her?

17:52.798 --> 17:54.296
I like her.

17:57.055 --> 17:59.343
We went on a date once.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.777
- Really?
- Yeah. Super awkward.

18:02.812 --> 18:05.765
Haven't had the guts to
talk to her about it since.

18:06.026 --> 18:09.462
I don't know why that, of all things,

18:09.552 --> 18:12.153
was so scary to me...

18:12.188 --> 18:15.824
just talking to someone.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.816
When I was little,

18:26.269 --> 18:31.394
my mother used to read to me
these biographies for children.

18:32.566 --> 18:35.677
It was like... "Einstein for Kids."

18:35.711 --> 18:37.879
"Churchill for Kids."

18:39.214 --> 18:41.636
They were really good, actually.

18:42.070 --> 18:45.440
I guess I just... I always figured
that I'd read them to my kids.

18:46.022 --> 18:48.331
Just always figured there'd be...

18:50.107 --> 18:51.565
time.

18:55.598 --> 18:57.495
Yeah, I know what you mean.

18:58.723 --> 19:01.581
Jessica always wanted a little boy.

19:02.384 --> 19:04.752
And I would always say, "Relax.

19:04.874 --> 19:07.042
"We got all the time in the world."

19:12.298 --> 19:13.925
Wyatt.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.824
I am...

19:17.074 --> 19:19.675
I am so sorry that I said that
Jessica's death was meant to be.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.714
- You don't have to...
- I do.

19:22.957 --> 19:25.652
You deserve to get Jessica back.

19:28.931 --> 19:31.680
Well, I wish you could get Amy back too.

19:33.135 --> 19:37.238
And if I could make a deal
with Agent Christopher, I would.

19:42.678 --> 19:44.406
Yeah, well,

19:44.647 --> 19:46.172
what's the point of
having a time machine

19:46.197 --> 19:48.297
if you can't fix your regrets?

19:51.660 --> 19:52.827
Yep.

20:05.965 --> 20:08.148
The chief must be coming.

20:15.211 --> 20:16.611
The chief is a woman.

20:16.646 --> 20:18.580
Don't look so surprised.

20:18.614 --> 20:20.906
- You speak English.
- Missionaries.

20:20.931 --> 20:23.922
The language stayed.
Their faith did not.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.454
My name is Nonhelema.

20:26.489 --> 20:27.989
You're Nonhelema?

20:28.024 --> 20:30.547
I've heard of you before,

20:30.594 --> 20:34.594
because you are a great chieftess.

20:35.064 --> 20:38.867
And very beautiful
and super intimidating.

20:38.901 --> 20:40.719
And who are you?

20:41.370 --> 20:44.281
We're not here to hurt anybody.

20:44.306 --> 20:49.227
In fact, I'm Dr. Quinn,
and I'm a medicine woman.

20:50.687 --> 20:53.014
And this here is my brother,

20:53.049 --> 20:54.898
and we've come here to treat the sick

20:54.923 --> 20:56.451
and help in any way that we can.

21:00.972 --> 21:02.807
The French came to help.

21:02.832 --> 21:05.406
They said they wanted to trade.

21:05.635 --> 21:08.203
And then they start building forts.

21:08.676 --> 21:12.484
And when we fought back,
they killed all our men.

21:13.598 --> 21:15.466
To our women...

21:16.112 --> 21:19.076
my daughter still bears the scars.

21:21.482 --> 21:23.223
We were captured by the French as well.

21:23.248 --> 21:24.979
The English are no better.

21:25.014 --> 21:26.756
Look, if you let us go,

21:26.781 --> 21:29.017
- we promise...
- Promises.

21:29.480 --> 21:33.755
I've heard promises from
liars and thieves before.

21:40.502 --> 21:41.969
What is he doing?

21:41.994 --> 21:45.129
Oh, you know, just marking us for death.

21:50.824 --> 21:52.628
You live.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.646
Wait. Wha...

21:55.949 --> 21:57.445
Me? Why?

21:57.480 --> 21:59.180
You didn't choose to be here.

21:59.215 --> 22:01.058
You were forced to.

22:05.888 --> 22:09.057
No, no, no! Wait! Wait! No! No.

22:09.971 --> 22:11.181
Just stop.

22:13.806 --> 22:15.017
Ma'am?

22:16.432 --> 22:18.977
Respectfully, I'm asking you to listen.

22:20.220 --> 22:22.400
We're not who we said we were.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.372
We're not from France.

22:24.406 --> 22:28.024
We're not British; we're not
from anywhere around here.

22:28.509 --> 22:30.645
But these people didn't
force me to be with them.

22:30.679 --> 22:32.665
These people are my friends.

22:32.815 --> 22:35.696
They've saved my life on
more than one occasion.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.352
We look out for each other.

22:38.487 --> 22:39.946
Thing is,

22:40.425 --> 22:43.165
we're not even supposed to be here.

22:44.126 --> 22:46.032
We just want to go home.

22:46.328 --> 22:47.790
Now, you can kill them,

22:47.815 --> 22:50.298
and I'm pretty sure there
is nothing I can do about it,

22:50.332 --> 22:52.367
but if you do...

22:55.478 --> 22:57.913
you're gonna have to kill me too.

23:11.206 --> 23:14.527
My brother says to kill you all.

23:16.804 --> 23:19.621
But it is not his decision to make.

23:20.663 --> 23:22.833
If someone like him is willing

23:22.858 --> 23:25.902
to die for someone like you,

23:26.836 --> 23:30.605
then you're certainly not
from around here, are you?

23:31.614 --> 23:32.714
No.

23:36.545 --> 23:41.115
I will spare your lives
because of this man's honor.

23:41.150 --> 23:43.535
But if you prove him wrong,

23:43.560 --> 23:45.816
I will spare no one.

23:48.897 --> 23:50.732
About 6 inches to the left...

23:53.729 --> 23:55.479
I got something!

24:00.169 --> 24:02.537
- It's cracked.
- Open it.

24:04.667 --> 24:06.501
Careful.

24:16.559 --> 24:17.719
His note.

24:18.921 --> 24:20.121
It's gone.

24:32.622 --> 24:34.777
Thank you for what you did back there.

24:35.824 --> 24:38.316
That was incredibly brave.

24:39.461 --> 24:41.605
Figured if I was gonna die,

24:42.164 --> 24:43.864
I'd rather not do it alone in the woods.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.965
Oh, really? That's why?

24:49.137 --> 24:52.473
A blue and white uniform really
blends in here, don't you think?

24:52.507 --> 24:54.770
It's hard to believe they lost the war.

24:54.976 --> 24:57.690
So, how close are we to Fort Duquesne?

24:57.722 --> 25:00.121
Uh, just about 5 miles.

25:00.148 --> 25:02.550
But we need to come up
with a plan before we go.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.151
The plan is, you and I stall

25:04.186 --> 25:06.387
while Rufus finds the
supplies to the Lifeboat.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.888
But you got to be quick.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.724
Those soldiers are looking for us,
they could show up at any moment.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.959
Okay.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.763
Is anybody worried about the fact

25:15.797 --> 25:17.097
that neither of you speak French?

25:17.132 --> 25:18.588
I got that covered.

26:02.223 --> 26:04.705
More like Fort Dysentery.

26:10.650 --> 26:12.119
We've run the test three times.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.654
This is all we can make out.

26:16.591 --> 26:17.825
"Death."

26:17.859 --> 26:19.860
Well, that's not at all ominous.

26:19.895 --> 26:21.408
There must be more
tests you can do, right?

26:21.433 --> 26:22.997
I mean, UV lighting or...

26:23.031 --> 26:24.774
We've done every test there is.

26:24.799 --> 26:27.197
This is all we could get. I'm sorry.

26:27.814 --> 26:29.197
What does it mean?

26:29.222 --> 26:31.252
I'm afraid it can't be good.

26:47.394 --> 26:49.041
You got this.

27:05.450 --> 27:07.718
Come on. Come on.

27:28.296 --> 27:30.264
What do you think's taking him so long?

27:30.298 --> 27:31.588
I don't know.

28:30.736 --> 28:32.359
Hit him.

28:32.394 --> 28:33.736
- What?
- Hit. Him.

28:38.566 --> 28:39.800
What was he gonna do?

28:39.834 --> 28:41.635
Trust me, you don't want to know.

28:41.669 --> 28:43.170
- Took you long enough.
- Did you get what you need?

28:43.204 --> 28:44.415
Yeah. Got it.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.337
Let's get the hell out of here.

29:11.773 --> 29:13.416
What are you doing?

29:13.441 --> 29:14.575
Come on!

29:14.602 --> 29:16.017
Isn't that a bit of a high jump?

29:16.042 --> 29:18.072
Beats facing a French
firing squad. Let's go.

29:18.106 --> 29:19.840
When you put it like that...

29:19.874 --> 29:23.236
I'm just gonna go ahead
and say it. 1754 sucks.

29:31.738 --> 29:34.495
- There any sign of our French pals?
- Not yet!

29:34.520 --> 29:36.768
They'll see our tracks.
They won't be far behind.

29:40.503 --> 29:43.042
Oh, come on. That can't actually work.

29:43.067 --> 29:44.868
It should work enough for one trip.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.953
Except, we won't know until
the rings start spinning.

29:47.987 --> 29:51.156
But, by then, it'll be too
late to change our minds.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.175
What do you mean, "change our minds"?

29:54.894 --> 29:57.496
Without the navigation
system, we could land anywhere.

29:57.530 --> 29:58.964
The Earth is 70% water.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.532
We could land in the
middle of the ocean,

30:00.566 --> 30:02.151
on a mountain, inside of a mountain.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.454
The middle of Fallujah would
be an amazing result right now.

30:04.479 --> 30:06.142
Needless to say, it is very complicated,

30:06.167 --> 30:08.509
and we need Jiya and
Mason to help us land.

30:08.534 --> 30:10.347
That is, provided they got my note.

30:11.110 --> 30:14.045
Let's say they didn't.
What are the odds?

30:14.080 --> 30:17.382
Somewhere between one in
a billion and impossible.

30:18.451 --> 30:20.452
How do they help us land?

30:27.894 --> 30:29.494
Hey, there.

30:29.529 --> 30:31.229
I don't know what else to do.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.064
Well, I do.

30:35.535 --> 30:37.951
My boss usually frowns
on drinking at work.

30:37.976 --> 30:41.412
Well, I think he'll
let it slide this once.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.409
Rufus ever tell you how we met?

30:46.646 --> 30:48.413
No.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.882
I was doing charity outreach.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.517
Inner-city neighborhoods.

30:52.552 --> 30:54.719
Plucking out the best and brightest.

30:54.754 --> 30:56.581
Made me feel good.

30:57.723 --> 31:00.091
It made me look good too.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.894
So we're at the science
fair in this run-down,

31:02.929 --> 31:05.530
gang-infested Chicago middle school.

31:05.565 --> 31:07.599
The whole thing's pathetic, really,

31:07.633 --> 31:10.902
but I see this scrawny, nerdy kid.

31:10.937 --> 31:14.039
And he's got this scale
model of the entire city

31:14.065 --> 31:17.234
re-engineered with a monorail system

31:17.276 --> 31:20.045
that runs entirely on
recycled coffee pods.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.646
Somehow, I'm not surprised.

31:21.681 --> 31:23.657
No, so, you know, I
invite him to talk to me

31:23.682 --> 31:25.665
after the science fair,
and he knows who I am,

31:25.690 --> 31:28.095
and he says, "No, no, sorry,
Mr. Mason, I'd love to,

31:28.120 --> 31:30.488
"but I can't be late
to pick up my brother."

31:30.523 --> 31:34.643
I think, "Wow, a genius with
a sense of responsibility."

31:34.861 --> 31:37.762
I thought, "He's gonna
do great things one day,

31:37.797 --> 31:41.633
"and when he does, I
want it to be for me."

31:45.471 --> 31:47.572
First time I met Rufus,

31:47.607 --> 31:50.976
he saw the Tribble
that I got at Comic-Con,

31:51.010 --> 31:54.179
and he told me that we
would never be friends

31:54.213 --> 31:56.822
'cause I was "Star Trek"
and he was "Star Wars."

31:56.847 --> 31:58.109
Yeah, that sounds just like Rufus.

31:58.134 --> 32:02.040
He was always one who could
take awkward to bold new heights.

32:02.822 --> 32:04.964
You say it like he's gone.

32:05.558 --> 32:08.979
Come on, I mean, any
minute, he's gonna be back,

32:09.004 --> 32:11.574
bragging about his
latest trip, you know,

32:11.599 --> 32:13.823
what a hero he was.

32:13.848 --> 32:15.634
Like Han Solo.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.237
What is it?

32:22.074 --> 32:24.745
I think I know what
Rufus is trying to say.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.047
Now, there are a number of reasons

32:29.081 --> 32:30.815
why they might not be back yet,

32:30.850 --> 32:32.915
most of them really
bad, but let's just say

32:32.940 --> 32:34.552
something happened to
the navigation system.

32:34.587 --> 32:36.236
- Well, how do you know...
- I'm getting to that.

32:36.261 --> 32:38.857
If the nav system is down,

32:38.891 --> 32:40.659
Rufus is gonna need our
help with the landing.

32:40.693 --> 32:42.627
I left specific
instructions... a series of code

32:42.662 --> 32:44.526
that detail how the
team at Mason Industries

32:44.551 --> 32:47.393
can take over and essentially
bring us home via remote control.

32:47.418 --> 32:49.339
Now, we won't be able to do anything

32:49.364 --> 32:53.261
until it's in transit, so what
we need to do is catch him...

32:54.565 --> 32:55.993
mid-jump,

32:56.242 --> 32:58.517
take over the controls,
and guide him in here.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.175
It's an interesting theory, Jiya,

33:00.200 --> 33:02.267
but how are you getting all
that from a few words in a note?

33:02.292 --> 33:03.882
Because I filled in the blanks.

33:03.916 --> 33:06.084
Rufus made an analogy to
a movie you might've seen.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.237
It's like what the Death Star did...

33:07.262 --> 33:09.464
... To the Millennium Falcon.

33:09.489 --> 33:11.784
That's what Rufus was trying to say.

33:11.809 --> 33:14.392
And you can do that?

33:15.159 --> 33:16.860
Maybe.

33:17.129 --> 33:20.098
- But I'm gonna need help.
- So what are our options?

33:20.132 --> 33:21.479
We stay here and fight off the French

33:21.504 --> 33:24.136
or die of smallpox eventually?

33:24.161 --> 33:25.361
Pretty much.

33:26.539 --> 33:28.139
Likely death either way.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.709
Yeah.

33:30.743 --> 33:33.597
What the hell? I'm in.

33:35.614 --> 33:36.781
Me too.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.051
Tough call for me.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.787
I was really hoping to
be sold into slavery.

33:52.932 --> 33:54.766
Horses.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.602
They're coming.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.641
Tirez!

34:26.554 --> 34:28.225
- Hurry up.
- Here we go.

34:28.250 --> 34:29.484
Okay.

34:37.422 --> 34:40.065
- Go where? We're not going anywhere.
- No. No. No. No.

34:47.074 --> 34:48.780
Rufus, come on!

34:51.679 --> 34:53.413
This patch is not as strong
as the rest of the ship.

34:53.447 --> 34:55.530
- If they hit it...
- You're not helping!

34:55.623 --> 34:57.975
Come on, Rufus. Get us out of here.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.909
Mon Dieu.

35:26.413 --> 35:28.780
The Lifeboat is in transit.
We need to do this now.

35:28.805 --> 35:32.151
- It's not ready.
- We don't have time for ready.

35:58.569 --> 36:01.491
Initiate Lifeboat arrival procedure.

36:06.420 --> 36:07.787
Sorry we're late.

36:07.821 --> 36:09.225
We hit some traffic.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.302
Okay.

36:11.327 --> 36:13.461
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:16.428 --> 36:19.299
- You all right?
- We made it.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.668
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

36:52.709 --> 36:54.634
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:58.124 --> 37:01.020
Um... I heard you got it

37:01.045 --> 37:03.362
just from "Death" and "Millennium."

37:03.396 --> 37:05.364
Took me a while, but yeah.

37:05.398 --> 37:08.436
I guess we know each other
better than I thought.

37:13.673 --> 37:14.991
Jiya.

37:15.016 --> 37:16.208
Yeah?

37:20.079 --> 37:21.932
Remind me to tell Mason

37:21.957 --> 37:23.760
that if he can build a time machine,

37:23.785 --> 37:25.900
then he can build a reasonably
durable plastic tube,

37:25.925 --> 37:27.346
because the only...

37:36.262 --> 37:37.496
Wow.

37:39.660 --> 37:41.338
What was that for?

37:42.001 --> 37:43.643
For making it back.

37:45.839 --> 37:47.315
Thanks to you.

37:49.008 --> 37:53.119
I need your authorization
for a surveillance operation.

37:53.346 --> 37:55.227
- On Connor Mason?
- That's correct.

37:55.252 --> 37:56.481
For what reason?

37:56.516 --> 37:58.083
I think he's hiding something from us,

37:58.117 --> 38:00.085
and I want to know what it is.

38:01.322 --> 38:04.523
Here it is. The
Pennsylvania Orb Incident.

38:04.557 --> 38:07.659
In September of 1754, a
group of French soldiers

38:07.694 --> 38:09.494
claimed to have seen a giant metal orb

38:09.529 --> 38:12.598
with spinning rings that
disappeared before their eyes.

38:12.632 --> 38:16.776
One of the earliest UFO sightings
in colonial North America.

38:16.936 --> 38:18.940
- What?
- All right.

38:18.965 --> 38:21.139
- We did it?
- That's us.

38:22.575 --> 38:24.776
Well, cheers to the French.

38:27.981 --> 38:29.293
After this,

38:29.318 --> 38:32.284
I'm gonna eat my body
weight in Chocodiles.

38:34.087 --> 38:35.613
About that...

38:39.626 --> 38:41.293
No!

38:41.327 --> 38:43.128
They're all yours.

38:44.297 --> 38:45.942
- Thank you.
- I wasn't sure

38:45.967 --> 38:48.486
if we were ever gonna
see any of this again.

38:48.879 --> 38:50.903
Yeah. We got lucky.

38:53.306 --> 38:56.329
You know, if you believe
there is such a thing as luck.

38:57.443 --> 38:58.814
What's wrong?

38:59.078 --> 39:00.412
I know you were angry with me

39:00.446 --> 39:01.993
for not telling you
about the journal, but...

39:02.018 --> 39:03.949
you never asked me why I
didn't tell you about it.

39:03.983 --> 39:05.784
Doesn't matter. It's
water under the bridge.

39:05.818 --> 39:07.753
It's a cheap fake, right?

39:09.656 --> 39:11.290
That's the thing.

39:11.991 --> 39:14.665
If I'm being really honest with myself,

39:16.129 --> 39:17.829
I don't know if it is.

39:20.199 --> 39:21.566
It's just too crazy.

39:21.601 --> 39:24.603
I mean, the mix of cursive and print,

39:24.637 --> 39:26.271
the way that I make my Gs...

39:26.306 --> 39:28.492
Wyatt, it looks so real,

39:28.517 --> 39:29.975
and I've thought so
since the Hindenburg,

39:30.009 --> 39:32.110
and if that's what I'm meant to be...

39:32.135 --> 39:34.845
- helping Flynn...
- That's not what you're meant to be.

39:35.308 --> 39:37.548
If you don't want to write
a journal, don't write it.

39:38.685 --> 39:41.892
My whole life, I have believed

39:42.388 --> 39:44.955
that...

39:44.980 --> 39:47.329
everything happens for a reason.

39:48.127 --> 39:50.961
That, for all of us, there is some plan

39:50.986 --> 39:53.501
for each one of us
that comes from some...

39:53.931 --> 39:55.907
What? A higher power?

39:56.267 --> 39:59.226
- Never took you for the spiritual type.
- Well, I am.

39:59.572 --> 40:03.442
And what does the spiritual
type look like exactly?

40:03.476 --> 40:04.702
I don't know.

40:04.727 --> 40:07.646
The thing is, is, if
this is my job now...

40:07.680 --> 40:10.148
protecting history, preserving the past,

40:10.183 --> 40:12.851
you know, saving the things
that are meant to be...

40:12.885 --> 40:16.321
how can I believe in fate and
not believe in my own fate?

40:16.356 --> 40:18.690
- Help me out here, Rufus.
- Don't look at me.

40:18.725 --> 40:21.218
My degrees are in
physics, not metaphysics.

40:22.328 --> 40:25.694
Look, we are in uncharted water here.

40:29.268 --> 40:30.836
Have a drink.

40:33.106 --> 40:34.506
Humor me.

40:34.540 --> 40:36.174
Okay.

40:40.046 --> 40:44.216
Okay. Now, did you
decide to take that drink,

40:44.250 --> 40:47.007
or was it pre-written,

40:47.454 --> 40:51.124
some kind of history that says
you were meant to take that drink?

40:52.091 --> 40:54.093
You made the choice, Lucy.

40:54.527 --> 40:56.094
And that's what history is.

40:56.129 --> 40:58.830
Right? It's choices.

40:58.865 --> 41:02.267
Some small, stupid, some monumental.

41:03.870 --> 41:05.737
But we make them.

41:07.040 --> 41:10.904
So if you're not happy with the history

41:10.929 --> 41:13.382
that Flynn has predicted for you,

41:14.914 --> 41:16.749
then rewrite it.
