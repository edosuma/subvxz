(mellow music playing)

01:03.767 --> 01:06.100
-Aah!
-Aah! Oh.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.300
Oh, Dorothy, what do you mean,
sneaking up on me like that?

01:09.367 --> 01:10.800
You scared me half to death.

01:10.867 --> 01:12.100
I'm sorry, Rose.

01:12.166 --> 01:14.600
Next time I walk into a dark room
in the middle of the night,

01:14.667 --> 01:16.900
I'll send a mariachi band
ahead of me.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.300
What are you doing up?

01:19.367 --> 01:21.734
I thought I heard a strange noise.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.734
What kind of strange noise?

01:23.800 --> 01:26.834
Like someone walking slowly
up creaking stairs.

01:27.367 --> 01:28.633
We don't have stairs.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.700
I know! How strange is that?

01:33.233 --> 01:34.233
What are you doing?

01:34.300 --> 01:36.667
Well, I thought I heard
a prowler outside.

01:36.734 --> 01:38.500
Oh, my God, Dorothy!
Why didn't you call the police?

01:38.567 --> 01:39.467
Oh, no, no.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.467
It turned out it was a neighbor's cat

01:41.533 --> 01:44.266
trying to mate
with our plastic flamingo.

01:47.266 --> 01:49.200
What is it? I heard screams!
What's happening?

01:49.266 --> 01:51.033
No, nothing.
Everything's fine, Blanche.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.567
We never should have watched <i>Psycho.</i>

01:55.300 --> 01:58.400
For 25 years, I have avoided that picture,

01:58.467 --> 02:00.633
even when Stan invited me
to the Roxy

02:00.700 --> 02:03.100
instead of over to
his mother's house for dinner,

02:03.166 --> 02:05.567
and it turned out
that my instincts were right.

02:05.633 --> 02:09.467
Norman Bates is scarier
than my mother-in-law.

02:11.066 --> 02:12.867
And a much better dresser.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.333
Oh, I never should have
watched it, either.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.767
It always upsets me,
especially that shower scene.

02:18.834 --> 02:22.133
Why, it's the reason
I prefer not to shower alone.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.300
Sure, Blanche,
and <i>Goldilocks and The Three Bears</i>

02:29.367 --> 02:31.567
is why you prefer not to sleep alone.

02:33.266 --> 02:35.133
At least we're not alone tonight.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.033
Oh, boy, you know,
there is nothing worse

02:38.100 --> 02:42.233
than being wide awake
and scared and by yourself.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.834
Oh, yes, there is...

02:44.400 --> 02:48.133
Being wide awake
and scared and by yourself

02:48.200 --> 02:51.600
without a double-fudge
chocolate cheesecake in the freezer.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.734
Ah! I'll get the silverware.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.033
-I feel better already.
-(laughs)

02:56.100 --> 02:59.533
You know, I never used to do anything
like this with my old roommates.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.567
You had roommates before us?
I never knew that.

03:02.633 --> 03:05.200
Oh, yes.
Two very eccentric old ladies

03:05.266 --> 03:08.166
who used to bathe together
and floss each other's teeth.

03:09.967 --> 03:12.600
I kicked 'em out one morning,
and that very afternoon

03:12.667 --> 03:15.000
went down to the supermarket
to advertise for new ones.

03:15.066 --> 03:17.100
That was when I first met Rose.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.767
(somber music playing)

03:31.066 --> 03:33.633
-Are you okay?
-Oh, I'm fine.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.367
Oh, I know exactly
what you're going through.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.300
-I can read it in your face.
-You can?

03:38.367 --> 03:41.700
Oh, sure. Your husband
or your boyfriend dumped you.

03:41.767 --> 03:43.367
Oh, honey, don't let it get you down.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.166
It's just the nature of the beast.

03:45.233 --> 03:47.333
They'd do it in the mud if they had to.

03:48.767 --> 03:50.300
You just go sleep with his best friend.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.000
That'll even up the score.

03:56.633 --> 03:58.734
Am I on <i>Candid Camera?</i>

04:01.233 --> 04:02.734
You mean, you didn't get dumped?

04:02.800 --> 04:05.700
Well, actually, I did,
by my landlord.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.533
He threw me out of my apartment,

04:07.600 --> 04:09.967
but I couldn't sleep with his best friend.

04:10.033 --> 04:11.867
He's... he's over 80 years old

04:11.934 --> 04:13.900
and thinks he's the Archduke Ferdinand.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.133
Why did he throw you out?

04:17.200 --> 04:19.333
The new owners of the building
don't allow cats,

04:19.400 --> 04:21.266
and I'm not about to part
with Mr. Peepers.

04:21.333 --> 04:24.900
Oh, I guess you two have been
through a lot together, huh?

04:24.967 --> 04:27.667
Yes. I found him last week.

04:28.266 --> 04:30.800
But I... I wouldn't feel right
having a home if he didn't.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.934
We've become very attached.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.066
I think that shows
great strength of character.

04:35.133 --> 04:38.734
I like you and I like cats.
I also happen to have a room for rent,

04:38.800 --> 04:40.200
and the name is Blanche Devereaux.

04:40.734 --> 04:42.767
Why would you name a room
Blanche Devereaux?

04:42.834 --> 04:44.867
(laughs)

04:44.934 --> 04:46.834
That's very good.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.500
I like a roommate
with a sense of humor.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.900
My last two roommates were two old sticks
in the mud from Minnesota.

04:52.967 --> 04:55.467
Oh! Tell me a little 'bout yourself.

04:55.533 --> 04:58.600
Well, my name is Rose Nylund,
and I'm from Minnesota.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.000
Stop it, girl. You're killing me.

05:03.066 --> 05:04.934
Oh, but I'm not a stick in the mud.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.533
Oh, listen, I can let my hair down

05:06.600 --> 05:08.934
-and get crazy with the best of them.
-Really?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.900
Hey, I think we'd get along great.

05:10.967 --> 05:14.166
-I got a feeling you're a wild woman.
-Oh, you bet I am.

05:15.633 --> 05:17.433
I eat raw cookie dough.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.567
And occasionally,
I run through the sprinklers

05:22.633 --> 05:25.000
and don't wear a bathing cap.

05:25.066 --> 05:26.400
And at Christmas,
I've been known

05:26.467 --> 05:28.100
to put away more than one eggnog.

05:31.867 --> 05:35.066
-What's the matter?
-I think I'd better keep looking.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.400
Oh, I... I'll stop eating
raw cookie dough.

05:37.467 --> 05:38.433
No, honey, that's not it.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.233
It's just the two of us
have nothing in common.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.533
We're just two different kinds of people.
It wouldn't work out, believe me.

05:46.867 --> 05:48.467
Can I pet your cat, lady?

05:48.533 --> 05:50.433
Why, sure, sweetheart.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.800
-What's his name?
-Mr. Peepers.

05:52.867 --> 05:56.166
I had a cat just like him.
His name was Harpo.

05:56.233 --> 05:58.800
But he died. I miss him.

05:58.867 --> 06:02.100
Oh, well, you'll have to
get yourself another kitty.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.433
Would your mommy let you
have another kitty?

06:05.500 --> 06:08.734
Yeah, she said she would
get me one next week.

06:09.200 --> 06:14.567
Well, if you'll promise to give him
a really, really good home,

06:14.633 --> 06:16.367
I'll let you have Mr. Peepers.

06:16.433 --> 06:17.567
Great.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.700
Would it be okay if I call him Harpo?

06:20.333 --> 06:21.767
Well, I don't think he'd mind.

06:21.834 --> 06:24.700
-(Boy) Thanks a lot, lady.
-(Rose) There you go, sweetheart.

06:24.767 --> 06:25.834
Mom!

06:27.667 --> 06:29.600
Say, Rose... um...

06:29.667 --> 06:31.133
Look, now, I'm not making any promises,

06:31.200 --> 06:34.066
but how would you like to take a look
at that Blanche Devereaux room?

06:34.133 --> 06:36.200
Really? I'd love to.

06:36.266 --> 06:38.934
-Come on, let's go.
-By the way, what's your name?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.100
(Blanche) <i>That last remark was the reason</i>

06:43.166 --> 06:45.367
<i>I didn't let you move in</i>
<i>that same day.</i>

06:45.433 --> 06:47.367
<i>But after I saw</i>
<i>what I had to choose from,</i>

06:47.433 --> 06:49.700
<i>you seemed like a gift from heaven.</i>

06:49.767 --> 06:53.033
<i>You wouldn't believe</i>
<i>some of the people I interviewed.</i>

06:53.100 --> 06:57.367
Well, I think that about completes
our tour, Madame Zelda.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.500
Anything else I can tell you
about the place?

07:01.567 --> 07:04.600
Yes. Was a young woman
in a nurse's uniform

07:04.667 --> 07:06.533
murdered in this house
with a handsaw?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.166
Heavens, no!

07:08.233 --> 07:11.934
Are you sure?
I'm getting a very strong vibration.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.400
I see a woman in a white uniform
writhing and screaming,

07:15.467 --> 07:16.834
and there's a man
kneeling over her.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.800
If it was last Wednesday,
that was me

07:18.867 --> 07:21.266
and the gentleman
I'm currently dating, but...

07:24.000 --> 07:26.400
But that was a French maid's uniform.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.767
(doorbell rings)

07:28.834 --> 07:31.100
Mrs. Devereaux, you must
leave this house at once.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.700
It's possessed by an evil spirit.

07:32.767 --> 07:35.000
Actually, it's possessed
by Miami Federal.

07:36.066 --> 07:38.767
And at 7%, you couldn't
blast me out of here.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.700
-Yes?
-Are... are you Blanche Devereaux?

07:41.767 --> 07:45.266
-Yes, what can I do for you?
-Well, I'm Dorothy Zbornak.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.333
This is my mother, Sophia Petrillo.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.266
Remember we spoke on the phone
about sharing the house?

07:49.333 --> 07:51.000
Yes. Come in, uh-huh.

07:51.066 --> 07:54.100
Move in this house,
and you'll die an agonizing death.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.367
Thank you, Madame Zelda.
Goodbye.

08:02.433 --> 08:04.934
Oh, ladies, I'm sorry about that.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.700
You get so many weirdos
when you run an ad in the newspapers.

08:07.767 --> 08:08.700
Please sit down.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.600
Well, are you ladies
considering taking both rooms?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.133
Oh, no. Just me.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.700
Mother lives at the
Shady Pines Retirement Home.

08:17.767 --> 08:21.000
Oh, the Shady Pines. I know
the Shady Pines. It's a lovely place.

08:21.066 --> 08:22.467
It's a prison.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.934
They lock us in our rooms and force us
to look like we're having fun.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.500
Then they take pictures
for their brochure.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.033
Ma, you know that's not true.

08:36.533 --> 08:37.934
You'll have to excuse my mother.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.600
She recently had a stroke,

08:39.667 --> 08:43.066
and her perception
is a little, you know, distorted.

08:43.133 --> 08:46.633
-Oh, I understand.
-No, you don't.

08:47.467 --> 08:49.667
Why don't we start out
with a tour of the house,

08:49.734 --> 08:52.633
and later on we'll sit down and go over
that application you filled out.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.567
Wonderful. Oh, your house
is just breathtaking.

08:56.633 --> 08:57.934
I know.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.533
You said it looked like a dump
from the outside.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.867
(Blanche) This is the lanai.

09:08.934 --> 09:10.533
It is wonderful in the summertime.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.767
Especially if you like to sunbathe
with your top off.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.767
Oh, really, really?

09:14.834 --> 09:16.734
And the neighbors can't see in?

09:16.800 --> 09:17.734
Oh, sure they can.

09:21.133 --> 09:23.800
The woman has "slut"
embroidered on her underwear.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.700
Dear, ladies, I'm afraid
I'm running a little late.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.367
May I just ask you a few questions?

09:31.433 --> 09:33.767
Well, of course. Go right ahead.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.133
What do you call
an inhabitant of Guam?

09:38.467 --> 09:41.867
I don't know.
A Guamanian, I guess.

09:41.934 --> 09:43.667
What does this have to do
with renting the room?

09:43.734 --> 09:46.433
Oh, nothing. I just wanted
to finish my crossword puzzle.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.700
Now, then, Dorothy, would you say
you are a very neat person?

09:52.767 --> 09:55.400
Oh, yes. Very, very neat.

09:55.467 --> 09:57.867
Please. You're neat, and I wear a d-cup.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.967
(Dorothy)<i> At that moment,</i>
<i>I was convinced I'd blown it.</i>

10:05.033 --> 10:07.633
<i>I was sure I'd made</i>
<i>a bad first impression.</i>

10:07.700 --> 10:09.133
<i>But then I met Rose,</i>

10:09.200 --> 10:11.266
<i>and I realized</i>
<i>I could have shown up naked,</i>

10:11.333 --> 10:14.033
<i>playing a ukulele</i>
<i>and still gotten the room.</i>

10:14.100 --> 10:17.000
Oh, it's been such a lovely day.

10:17.066 --> 10:21.667
Mr. Sunshine really gave us
one of his biggest and brightest smiles.

10:21.734 --> 10:24.967
Oh, I feel like putting my arms
around mother nature

10:25.033 --> 10:26.633
and giving her a big kiss.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.266
Hi, you must be Dorothy.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.667
And you must be Mrs. Rogers.

10:33.567 --> 10:36.800
No, but we have a Mrs. Rogers
at the grief center.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.300
Oh, and there's a Mrs. Rogers
lives across the street.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.300
And then of course, there's Dale Evans,

10:41.367 --> 10:43.667
the most famous Mrs. Rogers
of them all.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.767
I didn't catch your name.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.500
I'm Rose Nylund, your new roomie.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.166
Blanche has told me all about you.

10:52.233 --> 10:54.467
Sorry your husband dumped you.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.166
You can borrow my bubble bath
anytime you want.

10:59.066 --> 11:01.133
That'll help ease the lonely nights.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.700
Thank you very much.

11:03.467 --> 11:04.900
Oh, I see you two
are getting acquainted.

11:04.967 --> 11:07.100
Yes. I'm just gonna take my stuff
to my room.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.667
It's the second on the left
down the hall there?

11:09.734 --> 11:11.900
Dorothy, the second
on the left is mine.

11:11.967 --> 11:13.967
Blanche had promised it to me.

11:14.033 --> 11:16.500
Blanche promised it to me, too.
Didn't you, Blanche?

11:16.567 --> 11:18.633
Whoops.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.567
Oh, great, great.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.867
What are we supposed to do now?

11:23.934 --> 11:26.700
Back in Minnesota,
we'd settle this kind of a dispute

11:26.767 --> 11:28.533
with some good-natured logrolling.

11:29.367 --> 11:31.734
Sorry, Rose. My log is in the shop.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.600
What do we do now, toss a coin?

11:35.667 --> 11:37.000
-Okay.
-All right.

11:37.467 --> 11:39.767
-I'll take tails?
-Okay.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.200
Tails. You win.

11:44.266 --> 11:46.100
I'll make it up to you,
Dorothy, I promise.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.533
Listen, if there's ever a night
where you can't sleep,

11:48.600 --> 11:51.300
I'll come to your room
and sing "Kumbaya."

11:53.100 --> 11:55.967
(laughing) Rose, I don't know what to say.

11:56.033 --> 11:57.300
Yes, I do.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.800
Don't ever do that.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.133
Well, Rose, what do you say
we help Dorothy move her things, okay?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.233
Okay.

12:07.300 --> 12:11.934
Gee, this is fun already,
being roomies with you two.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.100
-(vase shatters)
-Oh!

12:13.166 --> 12:14.400
-Oh!
-Blanche!

12:14.467 --> 12:17.333
Ohh, Blanche,
I am so sorry.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.166
Oh, I'll buy you another one.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.800
Well, you can't.
That was one of a kind.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.967
Oh, well, don't feel bad.
I never really liked it much anyway.

12:26.033 --> 12:30.500
It's just that my grandmother
gave this to me on her deathbed.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.834
She was very, very sick
for a very, very long time.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.767
I loved her very, very much.

12:40.834 --> 12:44.834
Blanche, why don't you just grind
the broken pieces in her hand?

12:47.333 --> 12:49.467
Blanche, I... I know I can't replace it,

12:49.533 --> 12:51.100
but I... I wanna make it up to you.

12:52.300 --> 12:55.200
Listen, since this is
our first night as roommates,

12:55.266 --> 12:58.367
I'd like to invite the two of you
to dinner at my favorite restaurant.

12:58.433 --> 13:01.367
-Well, that's very sweet of you, Rose.
-Well, thank you, Rose.

13:01.433 --> 13:02.400
Then we'd better hurry,

13:02.467 --> 13:06.600
'cause the strawberry blizzard special
at the Dairy Queen only lasts till five.

13:07.834 --> 13:08.667
Come on, I'll drive.

13:08.734 --> 13:11.266
Oh, let's not drive.
Let's skip there.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.300
(somber music playing)

13:21.000 --> 13:24.400
Oh, my goodness,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

13:24.467 --> 13:27.633
-And I am still wide awake.
-Me, too.

13:27.700 --> 13:31.400
You know, before I met you two girls,
I was never up this late.

13:31.467 --> 13:34.100
Except, of course,
during the <i>Jerry Lewis Telethon.</i>

13:35.400 --> 13:36.200
Of course.

13:36.266 --> 13:38.533
I was never a night person, either,

13:38.600 --> 13:40.533
until I blossomed
into young womanhood

13:40.600 --> 13:44.133
and realized I was even more
devastating by moonlight.

13:44.867 --> 13:45.767
Of course.

13:45.834 --> 13:48.934
I will never forget the night
I made that discovery.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.433
It was during the spring cotillion.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.300
I was wearing
a long white dress

13:52.367 --> 13:53.800
and my first push-up bra.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.367
And Bobby "Buck" McAllister
and I

13:57.433 --> 14:00.133
were enjoying a glass of punch
out on the veranda

14:00.200 --> 14:02.667
when a beam of moonlight
hit my cleavage.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.967
Suddenly, the band began to play.

14:10.567 --> 14:12.300
It was at that moment I realized

14:12.367 --> 14:15.233
my bosoms had the power
to make music.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.300
Didn't Bette Midler win
a special Grammy for that?

14:28.166 --> 14:30.000
(laughing)

14:30.633 --> 14:32.700
Oh, girls, isn't it wonderful

14:32.767 --> 14:35.333
how we always have
such a good time together?

14:35.400 --> 14:37.100
It's been that way
right from the start.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.700
Please, Rose.

14:38.767 --> 14:41.266
Don't you remember
the day after we moved in

14:41.333 --> 14:43.266
when we went shopping together?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.600
(tranquil music playing)

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Walking by that sausage case
back there

14:52.066 --> 14:54.400
really brought back
a lot of memories.

14:54.900 --> 14:58.133
Sausage opens a floodgate
for many of us, Rose.

14:59.433 --> 15:00.800
What's this, Blanche?

15:00.867 --> 15:02.433
-Smoked oysters.
-Oh, come on.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.266
Now, I know we said we'd go in
on everything equally,

15:05.333 --> 15:06.967
but this is $4 a can.

15:07.033 --> 15:10.700
Well, we have to have these.
They're absolutely essential.

15:10.767 --> 15:15.233
Well, if you ever have a date with a man
who's a little... sluggish,

15:17.433 --> 15:19.767
a tin of these and a bottle of cold duck,

15:19.834 --> 15:21.567
you'll be prying him off the wall.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.600
-Those are very nice cantaloupes.
-Why, thank you.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.166
-This one's ripe.
-And how do you tell, Dorothy?

15:49.233 --> 15:50.934
Well, you smell the tip of it.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.934
It's an old Sicilian method
my mother taught me.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.667
Oh, Dorothy, dear,

15:54.734 --> 15:57.900
the best way to tell if a melon is ripe
is southern. You thump it.

15:57.967 --> 16:01.500
Well, actually, roomies,
I have the best method,

16:01.567 --> 16:03.133
the farm method.
It works every time.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.266
And what might that be, Rose, dear?

16:12.166 --> 16:14.033
No. Mm-mm.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.600
Better.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.066
Yeah, I almost forgot.

16:28.133 --> 16:31.633
We need a <i>Globe</i> and A <i>Tattler</i>
and a <i>Midnight Star</i>

16:31.700 --> 16:35.367
and an <i>Enquirer</i> and I guess
maybe one serious newsmagazine

16:35.433 --> 16:38.233
so we know what's going on
in the world, one <i>People.</i>

16:41.166 --> 16:42.333
(scanner beeps)

16:42.400 --> 16:45.233
Ah, excuse me, you made a mistake.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.233
Those peaches aren't 59 cents
a pound, they're 89 cents.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.467
Honesty is the best policy.

16:50.533 --> 16:54.200
What are you trying to do, Rose,
qualify for some kind of scout badge?

16:54.266 --> 16:56.867
I can't help it if I'm an honest person.

16:56.934 --> 16:59.400
Obviously something you don't know
anything about.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.233
What are you talking about?

17:02.300 --> 17:05.800
Well, you bought pantyhose in petite.
(laughs)

17:06.800 --> 17:09.433
Anybody can see you couldn't
get those past your knees.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.266
If you don't keep your voice down,

17:12.333 --> 17:14.433
I'm gonna hit you in the head
with this loin of pork.

17:16.333 --> 17:20.467
Oh, Blanche, come on!
$15.99?

17:20.533 --> 17:22.133
Now, this is just too extravagant.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.633
I'm not going in on this.
I don't even like loin of pork.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.467
All right, then I'm not
going in on this nightstick.

17:27.967 --> 17:31.266
-This is a pepperoni.
-It's obnoxious.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.166
Uh, excuse me. You made a mistake.

17:36.233 --> 17:38.266
That windex isn't on sale this week.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.600
The regular price is $1.99.

17:41.133 --> 17:44.166
Rose, why don't you just save it
for <i>The Price Is Right?</i>

17:45.633 --> 17:47.867
Excuse me for trying
to be a good American.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.667
Will you two please
keep your voices down?

17:50.734 --> 17:54.734
I have shopped and dated extensively
throughout this market.

17:55.266 --> 17:57.934
That does it. That does it.
I am shopping for myself.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.734
Fine! Blanche and I will do
very nicely on our own.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.100
Oh, no, I'm not shopping with you,
Mary Poppins.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.200
Fine!

18:06.567 --> 18:07.433
(sighs)

18:25.500 --> 18:28.467
(clattering)

18:34.467 --> 18:38.633
All right, who put the raisin bran
in the refrigerator?

18:39.233 --> 18:41.934
I did. Do you have
a problem with that?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.867
Yes, I do. I have two problems with it.

18:43.934 --> 18:45.467
First of all, there isn't room
for it in there,

18:45.533 --> 18:48.200
and second of all, it doesn't go in
the refrigerator, it goes in the cabinet.

18:48.266 --> 18:51.100
It does not go in the cabinet.

18:51.166 --> 18:53.000
It stays fresher
in the refrigerator.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.100
(Blanche) No, it does not stay fresher
in the refrigerator.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.567
If it stayed fresher in the refrigerator,

18:56.633 --> 18:59.333
there would be a sign on it
saying "refrigerate."

18:59.400 --> 19:01.166
Actually, you're both wrong.

19:01.233 --> 19:04.500
It does not belong in the refrigerator.
It does not belong in a cabinet.

19:04.567 --> 19:07.033
It belongs in a glass canister.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.367
That way, it's not only
visually appealing,

19:09.433 --> 19:12.033
but you can see if they cheated you
out of raisins.

19:13.433 --> 19:15.500
I thought everybody knew that.

19:15.567 --> 19:17.400
You know, until I met you, Rose,

19:17.467 --> 19:20.934
I didn't know that people actually
talk back to their rice Krispies.

19:22.633 --> 19:25.066
Uhh. All right, I have had it.

19:25.133 --> 19:28.367
Thanks to all this constant bickering,
I now have a splitting headache.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.033
Oh, girls, let's face facts.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.433
The three of us just can't agree
on anything.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.300
I mean, it is obvious
we were not meant to live together.

19:36.367 --> 19:39.000
I hate to agree with you,
but I think you're right.

19:39.066 --> 19:42.800
I think so, too. In fact, I know so.

19:43.166 --> 19:46.834
This is exactly what happened
during the Great Herring War.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.433
The Great Herring War?

19:53.500 --> 19:55.767
Yes. Between the Lindstroms
and the Johanssons.

19:55.834 --> 19:58.633
Oh, that Great Herring War.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.800
The two families controlled
the most fertile herring waters

20:02.867 --> 20:03.867
off the coast of Norway,

20:03.934 --> 20:05.967
so naturally it seemed
like it would be

20:06.033 --> 20:08.600
in their best interest
to band together.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.333
Oh, boy, was that a mistake.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.433
You see, they couldn't agree
on what to do with the herring.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.166
Oh, well, that's understandable.

20:16.233 --> 20:19.066
I mean, the possibilities
are overwhelming.

20:20.500 --> 20:24.200
Exactly. The Johanssons wanted
to pickle the herring

20:24.266 --> 20:27.233
and the Lindstroms wanted
to train them for the circus.

20:30.967 --> 20:34.100
Weren't they kind of hard to see,
riding on the elephants?

20:35.734 --> 20:38.700
Oh, not that kind of circus.
A herring circus.

20:38.767 --> 20:41.834
Sort of like Seaworld, only smaller.

20:43.166 --> 20:46.367
-Much, much smaller.
-(Dorothy chuckles)

20:46.433 --> 20:48.700
-But bigger than a flea circus.
-(Blanche) Mm-hmm.

20:48.767 --> 20:51.433
Tell me, Rose, um...

20:51.500 --> 20:53.333
(laughs)

20:54.333 --> 20:57.433
Did they ever shoot a herring
out of a cannon?

21:08.700 --> 21:10.033
Only once.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.033
(laughing)

21:14.667 --> 21:16.433
But they shot him into a tree.

21:19.233 --> 21:21.367
After that, no other herring would do it.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.266
You're making this up!

21:26.333 --> 21:30.900
I am not! My grandfather
told me that story.

21:30.967 --> 21:34.367
Of course, he also used to
call me by my sister's name.

21:36.166 --> 21:39.433
And... and sometimes he'd wear his
underwear on the outside of his pants.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.333
I guess he wasn't
a very reliable source.

21:47.600 --> 21:51.166
Ohh. Ah-ha-ha!

21:51.233 --> 21:53.133
Oh, girls...

21:53.200 --> 21:56.066
Girls, do you realize
what just happened?

21:56.133 --> 21:57.934
I know I've been having
a very good time,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.467
and there wasn't even
a man in the room.

22:02.734 --> 22:04.367
Do you think it was just a fluke,

22:04.433 --> 22:06.200
or do you think we could learn
to like each other?

22:06.266 --> 22:08.867
Well, I think it might take time,

22:08.934 --> 22:11.533
but... but I think it could be worth it.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.600
-Let's give it a shot.
-Great!

22:13.667 --> 22:15.533
-I'm game.
-Okay.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.266
(all laughing)

22:21.967 --> 22:24.667
Wait a minute. What's that?

22:24.734 --> 22:28.200
Oh, I'm sorry. I know it's awful,
but I have this incredible sweet tooth.

22:28.266 --> 22:29.467
-What is it?
-Cheesecake.

22:29.533 --> 22:30.567
-What kind?
-Chocolate.

22:30.633 --> 22:32.066
Oh, I think this could be

22:32.133 --> 22:34.367
the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.934
I guess some things never change.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.266
They sure don't. We've almost finished
the entire cheesecake.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.200
Oh, what the hell.
It was a special occasion.

22:47.266 --> 22:50.800
Yeah, and it sure took
my mind off of <i>Psycho.</i>

22:50.867 --> 22:53.300
Listen, these can wait till morning.
Let's go to bed.

22:53.367 --> 22:55.300
Okay. (yawns)

22:57.133 --> 22:59.834
-Aah!
-Aah!

22:59.900 --> 23:02.467
(laughing)

23:09.767 --> 23:12.467
Ma, that is not funny.

23:12.533 --> 23:14.433
Are you kidding? It's a riot.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.533
I pulled it once on old man Peterson,

23:17.600 --> 23:19.934
after we saw <i>Psycho </i>at the home.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.600
They had said
he would never walk again.

23:23.667 --> 23:24.934
He walked.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.734
Well, good night. Sweet dreams!

23:33.433 --> 23:36.400
Well... I think I'll have
just one more cup of tea.

23:36.467 --> 23:39.233
-Yeah, and we can finish the cheesecake.
-Sounds good.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.166
You know what would go so good
on this cheesecake

23:41.233 --> 23:42.600
is those chocolate sprinkles.

23:42.667 --> 23:44.033
We finished those an hour ago.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.166
We could crush some Oreos on top.

23:46.233 --> 23:48.166
We ran out of those two hours ago.

23:48.233 --> 23:50.900
-How about some whipped cream?
-Mmm!

23:50.967 --> 23:52.433
I think we still have a can.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.367
-I'll get it. It's in my bedroom.
-Never mind, Blanche.

24:08.567 --> 24:11.967
(closing theme music playing)
