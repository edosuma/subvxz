00:02.240 --> 00:03.439
TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:03.480 --> 00:04.679
-Once this whole
court thing's over,

00:04.719 --> 00:06.040
I can get strait to Indonesia.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.599
-Yeah, and what if
we go to jail, Aaron?

00:07.639 --> 00:08.800
AARON: Why so negative?

00:08.839 --> 00:11.160
-The board, in its
almighty wisdom,

00:11.199 --> 00:13.160
has decided to cut
the changes that you

00:13.199 --> 00:14.400
made to the curriculum.

00:14.439 --> 00:16.600
Pretty much anything
that's not classical.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.800
-If Damo doesn't make it
back, I'm in the company.

00:19.839 --> 00:22.679
-Hey, can we just
stop for a second?

00:22.719 --> 00:25.399
It doesn't feel right.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.800
FEMALE DOCTOR:
Dislocated patella.

00:26.839 --> 00:28.480
And I'm pretty sure
the femur's fractured.

00:28.519 --> 00:30.640
-Everyone keeps telling
me that I'm wasting time,

00:30.679 --> 00:31.839
that I have to choose!

00:31.879 --> 00:33.560
-Well, let me make
it easy for you then.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.520
THEME SONG: Whoa-oh, whoa.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.359
Whoa-oh, whoa.

00:53.399 --> 00:59.799
Take a breath, close your eyes.

00:59.840 --> 01:04.760
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:07.799 --> 01:11.680
This is my chance,
this is my chance.

01:11.719 --> 01:14.640
My chance to feel alive.

01:14.680 --> 01:18.159
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.280
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:25.200 --> 01:33.040
-Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

01:33.079 --> 01:34.680
TARA (VOICEOVER): So
apparently, there's

01:34.719 --> 01:37.480
this basic human
reaction to fear.

01:37.519 --> 01:40.359
It's called the fight
or flight response.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.319
ETHAN: 14.

01:53.359 --> 01:55.760
-Don't you have a company
costume fitting to go to?

01:55.799 --> 01:56.599
-It can wait.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.799
Focus on your VMO.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.400
TARA (VOICEOVER): When
something freaks us out,

01:59.439 --> 02:02.519
our first response
is to run very fast

02:02.560 --> 02:05.359
in the opposite direction.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.199
The second is
actually much harder.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.479
-I'm not hearing you breathe.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.879
-Ugh!

02:11.919 --> 02:15.159
TARA (VOICEOVER): It's where
you ignore every instinct.

02:15.199 --> 02:18.599
And instead of
running, you stay.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.240
And fight.

02:26.159 --> 02:27.800
-You're late.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.039
-Where's the other lawyer?

02:29.080 --> 02:30.800
-She's been reassigned.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.479
It's OK, she gave me your file.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.280
The court hearing's been
set for early next week.

02:35.319 --> 02:37.159
-Right.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.479
-Now, do you have a personal
reference from the school?

02:39.520 --> 02:40.680
-Not yet.

02:40.719 --> 02:42.639
-You know it's
important, Christian.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.800
-Look, what do you give me?

02:43.840 --> 02:47.800
60-40, 50-50, that
I'm going to juvie?

02:47.840 --> 02:51.759
-Well look, so long as uh, the
co-accused, your uh, friend,

02:51.800 --> 02:53.280
um--

02:53.319 --> 02:53.919
-Aaron.

02:53.960 --> 02:54.479
-Yeah, that's right.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.479
Aaron.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.800
So long as Aaron
supports your story

02:56.840 --> 02:58.400
about what happened
that night, there's

02:58.439 --> 02:59.479
a good chance you're getting
a suspended sentence, which

02:59.520 --> 03:01.120
means no time in
juvenile detention.

03:01.159 --> 03:02.039
-And if he doesn't show,
I just go down, right?

03:02.080 --> 03:03.159
-Yeah.

03:03.199 --> 03:04.080
We need Aaron to
say he's the one who

03:04.120 --> 03:05.199
planned the robbery, OK?

03:05.240 --> 03:08.639
He's the one who
brought the knife.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.560
Is he planning on skipping
out on his court date?

03:11.599 --> 03:13.319
-No, he, he's solid.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.759
-Good.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.439
Get that reference, all right?

03:17.479 --> 03:18.199
-Yep.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.319
-We'll take it from there.

03:29.639 --> 03:31.639
CHRISTIAN: Yeah, it's me.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.599
Again.

03:34.639 --> 03:37.599
[piano playing]

03:43.479 --> 03:44.800
-Chin up, Kat.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.080
You're at court.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.400
Be regal.

03:48.439 --> 03:51.639
-Sir, I think we should get
some uh, white crusty wigs.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.080
Very 18th century,
very fetching.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.400
-I know you all have an opinion
about the curriculum changes.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.120
But the board want us to spend
more time on the classics.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.079
Did Dr. Wicks say anything
about coming back to class?

04:16.120 --> 04:17.720
-We want to make sure
it heals properly.

04:27.079 --> 04:30.639
-I can't believe they
cut hip hop for this.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.399
PATRICK: Mr. Reed?

04:32.439 --> 04:34.240
Where's your note?

04:34.279 --> 04:34.920
-What?

04:34.959 --> 04:36.319
-New regime, new rules.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.600
Unexplained absences must
be taken to the principal.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.800
MR. KENNEDY: What's
going on, Christian?

04:46.839 --> 04:48.319
-I had to see my lawyer.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.199
He needs a personal reference.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.639
-And what's it going to say?

04:51.680 --> 04:55.199
Christian used to come to class,
but now can't be bothered?

04:55.240 --> 04:56.639
-You can say whatever you like.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.319
-Sit!

04:59.480 --> 05:03.480
The board is serious about
their new back to ballet policy.

05:03.519 --> 05:05.839
Our teaching methods
are being scrutinized,

05:05.879 --> 05:08.680
and even your being here
under bail conditions

05:08.720 --> 05:10.160
is something that they question.

05:10.199 --> 05:12.199
-Well, I'm sorry to make
things hard for you.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.279
-That's not what I meant.

05:14.319 --> 05:17.160
I just need you to
work with me a little.

05:17.199 --> 05:18.199
-You know what?

05:18.240 --> 05:19.480
Don't worry about it.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.439
-We can't take these
changes lying down.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.120
We have free will.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.040
We need a plan.

05:27.079 --> 05:28.600
-Um, I'd love to plan.

05:28.639 --> 05:29.600
But I have knee stuff.

05:29.639 --> 05:30.680
-Sammy.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.480
Uh, come find me
when you're free.

05:32.519 --> 05:32.839
-Hey.

05:32.879 --> 05:34.079
-Hey.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.480
-I was looking for
you last night.

05:35.519 --> 05:36.800
-Yeah?

05:36.839 --> 05:39.639
Oh, I was just
hanging out with Kat.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.600
-Again?

05:42.639 --> 05:44.199
You avoiding me?

05:44.240 --> 05:45.319
-No.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.800
It's just, you know,
you and Kat, you're

05:47.839 --> 05:49.800
like opposite magnetic poles.

05:49.839 --> 05:54.800
And anything in between is
instantly crushed and [laughs]

05:54.839 --> 05:58.279
it's not pretty.

05:58.319 --> 06:01.600
-So if I could be friends
with Kat, that would help.

06:01.639 --> 06:06.720
-[laughs] Sure.

06:06.759 --> 06:10.120
I, I should go.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.160
Kat's uh, I promised.

06:15.319 --> 06:17.360
DR. WICKS: How's that feel?

06:17.399 --> 06:18.839
-OK, I guess.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.199
-Well, the ligaments around
the patella are healing nicely.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.240
I think you're ready
to start class.

06:24.279 --> 06:25.639
Just barre work
at first, but you

06:25.680 --> 06:28.160
should be able to build up
your strength quite quickly.

06:28.199 --> 06:29.720
-No guarantees though, right?

06:29.759 --> 06:31.160
DR. WICKS: Never are.

06:31.199 --> 06:34.639
At some point, you have
to take a leap of faith.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.480
-Aaron, call me back.

06:36.519 --> 06:37.639
Our hearing's next week.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.160
I need to talk to you.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.839
-Hey.

06:42.879 --> 06:45.639
-Hey.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.399
-What did Mr. Kennedy say?

06:47.439 --> 06:49.839
Does he know you've
been missing classes?

06:49.879 --> 06:51.439
-Didn't think you noticed.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.439
-Don't worry about it.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.120
-Tara.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.519
Can we go somewhere and talk?

06:58.560 --> 06:59.639
-Now?

06:59.680 --> 07:02.680
Um, I'm supposed to
be meeting-- Ethan.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.720
He's helping me with my rehab.

07:04.759 --> 07:07.600
-Good for him.

07:07.639 --> 07:08.199
-Christian.

07:10.839 --> 07:12.399
I can't believe
this piece of paper

07:12.439 --> 07:15.319
means you get paid to dance
with the National Ballet!

07:15.360 --> 07:16.639
Wait, why haven't
you signed it yet?

07:16.680 --> 07:19.079
-I have the whole week to
read the fine print, so.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.040
-I would crawl over broken
glass to sign my contract.

07:22.079 --> 07:23.839
-Yeah well, you should
be glad that I haven't.

07:23.879 --> 07:25.680
Once I'm in the company,
I won't have time

07:25.720 --> 07:27.720
to be your personal spotter.

07:27.759 --> 07:29.680
Say 100 crunches?

07:29.720 --> 07:32.319
[hip hop music playing]

07:57.759 --> 07:59.360
-Ha!

07:59.399 --> 08:00.720
Hey stranger!

08:00.759 --> 08:01.800
-Have you seen Aaron?

08:01.839 --> 08:03.519
-Hey Kaylah, how's things?

08:03.560 --> 08:05.600
-Have you seen him?

08:05.639 --> 08:06.439
-Yeah.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.319
He's gone up north.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
Why?

08:08.399 --> 08:09.480
-Our sentencing
hearing is next week.

08:09.519 --> 08:10.120
KAYLAH: [groans]

08:10.160 --> 08:10.720
-No biggie.

08:10.759 --> 08:13.600
-I'll kill him.

08:13.639 --> 08:17.160
-So you guys been hanging out?

08:17.199 --> 08:19.399
-Listen, he just said he had
to go sort some stuff out.

08:19.439 --> 08:21.560
-So he might be here next week?

08:21.600 --> 08:22.639
-Yeah, it's possible.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.080
KAYLAH: His gran had a
rolling pin, remember?

08:38.120 --> 08:39.399
CHRISTIAN: I remember
you and Aaron

08:39.440 --> 08:41.519
were on the other side
of the street laughing

08:41.558 --> 08:43.399
at me, letting me
cop all the abuse.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.159
KAYLAH: [laughs] Price you
pay for being an idiot.

08:49.519 --> 08:52.799
Dude, what are you doing?

08:52.840 --> 08:55.480
-You never thought about it?

08:55.519 --> 08:57.159
-It's too much history.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.120
-Aaron's not coming back, is he?

09:03.159 --> 09:06.039
KAYLAH: He might.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.799
-You know, I can't
think about it anymore.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.480
I don't care what happens.

09:11.519 --> 09:13.799
(SHOUTING) I don't care!

09:13.840 --> 09:16.799
I don't care!

09:16.840 --> 09:18.799
-Yeah, you do.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.799
-No.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.799
No, I'm done.

09:22.840 --> 09:27.480
The future can be
whatever it's gonna be.

09:27.519 --> 09:29.159
-[laughs]

09:42.840 --> 09:45.320
-You can't dance forever
with a straight knee.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.759
-But my whole leg's shaking.

09:46.799 --> 09:48.120
-You need to build up strength.

09:48.159 --> 09:49.080
-It doesn't feel right.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.360
I'll do it another day.

09:50.399 --> 09:51.480
-Do it today.

09:51.519 --> 09:53.840
-I have to make sure
I recover properly.

09:53.879 --> 09:56.240
-You're stopping
because you're scared.

09:56.279 --> 09:57.799
-Do you know how
close I came to never

09:57.840 --> 09:58.840
being able to dance again?

09:58.879 --> 10:01.120
-That's why I'm pushing you!

10:01.159 --> 10:02.360
-It's easy for you.

10:02.399 --> 10:04.039
You have a contract
with the company.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.200
You know exactly where
your life is going.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.360
Why are you even here?

10:07.399 --> 10:09.240
Don't you have
rehearsals or something?

10:09.279 --> 10:11.399
-I thought I was helping you.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.799
-We're not getting
back together.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.559
So if that's what you
think this is about--

10:14.600 --> 10:16.600
-Trust me, that's the
last thing on my mind.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.799
KAT: Think of it like Defense
Against the Hip Hop Arts.

10:25.840 --> 10:26.639
You're Hermione.

10:26.679 --> 10:27.799
-Why am I Hermione?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.720
Why can't I be Harry?

10:29.759 --> 10:31.360
Or at least Ron?

10:31.399 --> 10:33.120
-OK look, you can be whoever you
what to be so long as you come

10:33.159 --> 10:36.240
and help me co-teach my
illegal hip hop class.

10:36.279 --> 10:36.759
-OK.

10:36.799 --> 10:38.039
I'll be there.

10:38.080 --> 10:38.720
-You are like blood
to me, Lieberman.

10:38.759 --> 10:39.440
Blood!

10:39.480 --> 10:40.600
-[laughs]

10:40.639 --> 10:42.679
PATRICK: Christian's
coming today, isn't he?

10:42.720 --> 10:43.679
-I guess.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.200
I mean, I'm not entirely sure.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.200
-He's gonna fail if he
doesn't show up to class.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.480
Do you know what's going on?

10:51.360 --> 10:52.080
-Maybe.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.639
