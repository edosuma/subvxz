AKU: Long ago in a distant land,

00:04.589 --> 00:09.219
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness

00:09.302 --> 00:12.722
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.181 --> 00:18.478
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword

00:18.686 --> 00:21.481
stepped forth to oppose me.

was struck, I tore open a portal in time

00:29.364 --> 00:33.701
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.202 --> 00:38.039
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.414 --> 00:43.127
and undo the future that is Aku.
