01:47.224 --> 01:48.384
Taxi!

01:53.197 --> 01:56.792
I need to get to the Bennet Music
Library, at 65th and 3rd.

02:16.487 --> 02:17.647
Meg?

03:16.714 --> 03:18.875
- Meg?
- Over here!

03:18.949 --> 03:20.109
Thank God.

03:20.718 --> 03:22.379
This had better be good.

03:24.321 --> 03:25.652
- It's good.
- Come on, Meg.

03:25.723 --> 03:27.350
What did you find?
I wanna know.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.551
Christine, remember when you said
that you wished

03:29.627 --> 03:31.959
we had something really
unusual for the addition?

03:32.029 --> 03:33.553
- Something really fresh?
- Yeah.

03:38.602 --> 03:40.433
This is very fresh, Meg.

03:40.504 --> 03:43.996
Christine, please. Trust me,
this is a major find.

03:44.074 --> 03:46.065
Don Juan Triumphant.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.239
By... Erik... Destler.

03:49.314 --> 03:52.449
- Right.
- Why does that name sound familiar?

03:52.517 --> 03:53.977
I don't know.
It shouldn't.

03:54.552 --> 03:56.884
I had to go through a dozen books
before I could find a footnote.

03:56.954 --> 04:00.355
It's really weird.
I know I've heard his name before.

04:00.424 --> 04:01.823
It must be another guy.

04:01.892 --> 04:03.757
Here. Look

04:03.827 --> 04:05.419
Right there.

04:07.264 --> 04:08.993
"Destler, Erik."

04:09.066 --> 04:11.432
"Known primarily for his unfinished
Opera

04:11.502 --> 04:13.129
"Don Juan Triumphant.

04:13.203 --> 04:17.264
Destler's musical reputation is
overshadowed by his infamy."

04:17.341 --> 04:18.466
Keep on reading.

04:18.541 --> 04:20.942
"He was said to be obsessed with
a young Opera singer...

04:21.011 --> 04:24.503
... who disappeared without a trace
the night of Destler's death.

04:24.582 --> 04:27.642
"Authorities believe, though were
never able to prove

04:27.718 --> 04:29.982
"that the composer was
a psychopathic killer

04:30.054 --> 04:32.648
"responsible for the brutal murders

04:32.723 --> 04:35.487
of at least a dozen London
residents."

04:35.559 --> 04:37.151
Isn't that weird?

04:37.227 --> 04:40.685
I mean, composer by day,
serial killer by night.

04:46.637 --> 04:49.629
But it's so gentle.
It's like a lullaby.

04:49.707 --> 04:53.643
I told you. Christine,
we'll blow them away with this.

04:53.711 --> 04:55.201
We can have it done
by tomorrow.

04:55.279 --> 04:57.110
I wanna hear more.

04:57.181 --> 05:00.344
That's it. That's all I could find.
It was squished between two books.

05:00.417 --> 05:01.645
- Where?
- Over there.

05:12.963 --> 05:15.693
We gotta get out of here.
It's almost midnight.

05:15.766 --> 05:18.200
Well, go grab your things and
I'll be right behind you.

05:18.268 --> 05:19.735
Ok.

05:40.724 --> 05:45.127
Don Juan Triumphant.

06:39.249 --> 06:40.648
Are you ok?

06:41.652 --> 06:42.812
What is it?

06:45.289 --> 06:46.620
It's nothing.

07:05.776 --> 07:08.267
Thank you.
Next.

07:21.959 --> 07:23.950
Please tell us a little
about yourself.

07:24.995 --> 07:26.724
My name is Christine Day.

07:26.797 --> 07:29.459
I'm second year at Juilliard,

07:29.533 --> 07:32.866
and I've done a couple of things
mostly classical.

07:32.936 --> 07:35.837
- I studied with--
- That's fine.

07:35.906 --> 07:38.466
What are you gonna sing
for us today?

07:38.542 --> 07:41.807
I'm gonna do a piece from
Don Juan Triumphant.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.710
By Erik Destler.

07:44.915 --> 07:46.576
Hold the noise,
please!

09:12.100 --> 09:13.395
Christine...

09:14.972 --> 09:17.463
Christine. Come back to me

09:23.046 --> 09:24.513
Come back.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.418
What happened?

09:35.592 --> 09:38.925
Christine!
Christine, wake up.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.487
Wake up.

09:41.565 --> 09:42.896
Wake up.

09:45.035 --> 09:46.696
Did you see what happened?

09:46.770 --> 09:48.101
Thank God.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.498
Meg?

09:51.575 --> 09:54.373
Of course. It's me.

09:59.716 --> 10:02.446
Don't speak.
Let's take you to your room.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.750
Sorry Miss. Don't know what happened.
It just fell.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.949
I'm sorry.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.994
Come, come, what has happened to
discipline in this company?

10:11.061 --> 10:13.552
Can we get on with it, please?

10:13.630 --> 10:17.896
Positions, everyone!
Let's start again, without Cybil!

10:19.766 --> 10:22.166
Act 3, scene 1--
Marguerite in the garden.

10:24.074 --> 10:26.736
I don't know what happened
but I feel fine.

10:26.810 --> 10:28.300
You better try to
get some rest.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.972
I can't sleep
I'm not tired...

10:31.048 --> 10:32.640
You had a scare.

10:32.716 --> 10:38.382
So strange... but I feel
exhilarated

10:39.289 --> 10:40.620
I'm on fire.

10:40.691 --> 10:43.159
No bloody wonder.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.490
An American singing with the
London Opera,

10:45.562 --> 10:47.359
understudy to the Diva

10:47.431 --> 10:49.422
The way Carlotta's screaming
her head off out there

10:49.499 --> 10:51.160
she might lose her voice
by tonight.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.725
You may have to do her part.

10:53.804 --> 10:57.001
- Small chance of that.
- Well, we can dream, can't we?

10:59.042 --> 11:00.737
Sleep-- for me.

11:00.811 --> 11:03.939
- All right?
- All right.

13:00.497 --> 13:02.658
Christine.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.260
I tell ya, there's an evil here.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.631
That was no accident of mine.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.403
Ghosts again.

13:47.477 --> 13:50.537
Laugh while you can. I've seen him...
moving on the catwalk.

13:50.614 --> 13:52.639
He's got eyes like fire.

13:53.316 --> 13:55.307
A death mask for a face.

13:55.385 --> 13:57.046
Oh, come on.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.678
Want to know what I think?

13:58.755 --> 14:01.417
I think you were getting
an eyeful of Christine.

14:01.491 --> 14:04.654
You had your hand down your trousers when
you should've been minding the ropes.

14:04.728 --> 14:05.990
Go to hell.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.723
Come on. There's work to do.

14:07.797 --> 14:10.459
Leave him alone.
We're better off without him.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.266
Joseph.

14:30.387 --> 14:31.718
Joseph.

15:19.169 --> 15:22.661
Yes...
let's have that drink.

15:29.479 --> 15:31.310
So...

15:31.381 --> 15:35.647
Your bumbling was the work
of a ghost.

15:35.719 --> 15:38.688
Nah, Nah.
It was... it was an accident.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.452
But you blamed me.

15:47.998 --> 15:49.795
It won't happen again.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.659
No... it won't.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.096
You're suspended.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.080
You were in fine voice today,
Christine.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.420
It's you, isn't it?

16:56.266 --> 16:59.599
Who else, Christine,
but your teacher,

16:59.669 --> 17:01.398
your angel.

17:09.045 --> 17:10.773
There was an accident.

17:11.848 --> 17:13.008
Something happened.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.811
It's of no importance.

17:14.884 --> 17:16.909
What matters is the music.

17:16.986 --> 17:19.386
Finish the song for me.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.788
But you never show
yourself to me.

17:22.459 --> 17:26.259
I will... soon.
Now sing!

17:33.570 --> 17:37.904
No. the lead.
Carlotta's part.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.033
That's the role you want,
isn't it?

17:40.110 --> 17:42.510
You're the only one
who can sing Marguerite

17:42.579 --> 17:45.047
as it was meant to be sung.

17:45.115 --> 17:46.275
Sing.

18:09.139 --> 18:10.265
No!

18:11.040 --> 18:13.873
With passion,
desire.

18:13.943 --> 18:16.104
Your voice and your
heart must be one.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.841
Now sing...
like an angel.

18:43.807 --> 18:45.968
You are ready, Christine.

18:46.709 --> 18:50.839
Tonight,
the world will hear you sing.

18:53.483 --> 18:54.541
Tonight?

18:54.617 --> 18:57.916
Tonight,
the world will love you.

19:18.341 --> 19:19.831
Do you mind?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.240
Excuse me, sir.

19:23.646 --> 19:25.807
Oh, Mr. Barton.
Miss Carlotta's expecting you.

19:25.882 --> 19:26.974
Thank you.

19:30.119 --> 19:31.177
Carlotta?

19:31.254 --> 19:33.245
Mr. Barton.
Please come in.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.623
I don't usually see anyone
before a performance.

19:37.694 --> 19:39.093
I'm flattered.

19:39.162 --> 19:40.220
Esther.

19:41.197 --> 19:44.257
Perhaps they'll brighten up this
rat's nest you call a dressing room.

19:44.334 --> 19:47.098
- This is the best room in the house.
- Then the house is lacking... my back.

19:51.374 --> 19:54.639
I have your contract... I think you'll
find everything to your satisfaction.

19:54.711 --> 19:58.203
A larger room would be better.
I barely have enough room for my things.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.546
Yes, well, we can discuss the finer
points later in good faith.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.984
That is for the good and faithful.

20:06.189 --> 20:08.180
That young lady,
Christine --

20:08.258 --> 20:09.919
I want her back in the chorus.

20:09.993 --> 20:13.759
She was lucky enough to play Cybil
to you, she's just an understudy.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.730
I want her out!

20:15.798 --> 20:18.926
Don't test me, Carlotta.
I could drown you too easily.

20:19.569 --> 20:22.561
Better submerged in bathwater
than mediocrity,

20:22.639 --> 20:24.163
don't you agree?

20:28.111 --> 20:29.544
All you have to
do is sign!

20:29.612 --> 20:31.375
I'll sing.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.972
You think about what
I said.

20:44.894 --> 20:46.486
You bitch.

20:47.897 --> 20:50.832
Tell wardrobe to take this in.
It's tailored for a sow.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.891
And hurry.
I need it for the third act.

20:52.969 --> 20:54.129
Yes, ma'am.

21:35.545 --> 21:38.139
Help me!

22:02.338 --> 22:05.136
I find it little wonder that the opera
was in the red when we purchased it.

22:05.208 --> 22:06.266
How's that?

22:06.342 --> 22:10.642
For a start, there's a monthly debit of 300.
No receipt, no invoice, nothing.

22:10.713 --> 22:13.375
That's a stipend to the opera ghost --
the phantom.

22:13.449 --> 22:14.473
The what?

22:14.550 --> 22:17.610
Phantom's theater tradition, old boy.
Box five's held for him every night

22:17.687 --> 22:20.178
It's silly, but you know how
these artistic people are.

22:20.256 --> 22:24.522
I know how bankers are. Richard, box
five is on the grand tier -- four seats.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.186
Who actually sits there?

22:26.262 --> 22:28.162
No one.
It's the phantom's box.

22:28.231 --> 22:30.961
I'm told it wards off the evil
eye or some such thing.

22:31.034 --> 22:34.731
For 300 a month and a private box,
I'll risk a gypsy curse.

22:34.804 --> 22:36.396
On opening night.

22:39.075 --> 22:40.235
No.

22:41.144 --> 22:42.475
No!

22:53.756 --> 22:56.247
- Good evening, Mr. Harrison.
- Good evening.

22:56.325 --> 22:58.259
Your reviews today
were a revelation.

22:58.327 --> 23:01.023
- As always.
- Madam, you're too kind.

23:03.032 --> 23:06.263
It's a fine crowd, my dear.
This will be a night to remember.

23:14.210 --> 23:15.802
Richard,
the curtain's about to go up.

23:17.847 --> 23:19.644
I'm afraid there's
been an accident.

23:22.952 --> 23:25.284
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:25.354 --> 23:27.914
I regret to tell you
that due to a sudden illness,

23:27.990 --> 23:32.484
our Diva, La Carlotta,
will not be appearing this evening.

23:32.562 --> 23:38.432
In her absence, the part of Marguerite
will be played by Miss Christine Day.

23:39.535 --> 23:40.593
Thank you.

23:41.504 --> 23:42.835
Come on, dear.

23:43.673 --> 23:47.575
My god. This is going to close us
faster than a house fire.

23:47.643 --> 23:48.803
Have you heard
Christine sing?

23:48.878 --> 23:50.709
I knew Carlotta was going
to do this to me.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.146
Barton, she's wonderful.

23:53.216 --> 23:56.652
We'll be tried for fraud.
I'm going to have a word with our Diva.

23:56.719 --> 23:58.949
There's nothing you can
do about it now.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.648
I can cure her
or kill her.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.450
Shh! quiet, please.

24:03.526 --> 24:05.255
Listen,
I'll go have a word with her.

24:05.328 --> 24:10.231
Perhaps a fresh face will succeed
where, obviously, charm has failed, hmm?

24:10.299 --> 24:12.699
Remember,
we are partners, after all.

24:47.170 --> 24:50.662
Thank you. Out of the way, please.
Out of the way.

24:51.741 --> 24:52.799
Step back, please.

24:52.875 --> 24:54.035
What's happening?!

25:00.283 --> 25:01.614
In the closet.

25:07.857 --> 25:10.758
His name's Joseph.
He's a scene shifter.

25:13.563 --> 25:15.224
Don't leave him like this

25:16.265 --> 25:17.596
Get him down.

25:18.835 --> 25:19.893
Stretcher.

25:19.969 --> 25:22.199
- Who found him?
- Right away, sir.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.670
Miss Carlotta, the Diva.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.139
She's feeling ill.
I sent her home to await a doctor.

25:26.209 --> 25:29.201
- I can have her --
- No. Send her home, too.

25:29.979 --> 25:31.708
- Inspector.
- Do it!

25:32.949 --> 25:34.416
We don't need her.

25:35.585 --> 25:37.075
I've seen this work before.

25:38.254 --> 25:40.654
She says
it's the phantom's work.

25:42.658 --> 25:47.994
This was no phantom, Davies!
Ghosts do not skin their victims.

25:48.798 --> 25:50.732
This is the work of an artist.

25:52.235 --> 25:54.726
An artist who works
in the flesh.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.293
You play very well.

27:01.170 --> 27:02.228
Thank you.

27:03.775 --> 27:05.775
What is it?

27:07.043 --> 27:08.101
It's mine.

27:08.911 --> 27:12.244
But you want it to
belong to the world.

27:12.315 --> 27:16.308
Yes. I want the world to love
me for my music.

27:17.153 --> 27:20.816
What would you give for
your music to live forever,

27:20.890 --> 27:24.826
like Beethoven, Mozart --
the immortals?

27:25.494 --> 27:28.428
Anything. I...
I'd give everything.

27:28.501 --> 27:33.793
Would you wed your soul...
with the devil?

27:34.170 --> 27:35.262
Yes!

27:39.742 --> 27:42.438
The world will love you
for your music, but...

27:45.548 --> 27:49.006
... that's all it will love
you for.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.304
There must be a thousand doors
in this Opera house.

28:49.378 --> 28:51.369
I want them all opened --
every one --

28:51.447 --> 28:53.176
and every room searched.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.382
But lock this one down.

28:56.185 --> 28:57.618
I don't want anyone
in here.

28:58.554 --> 28:59.543
Yes, sir.

29:04.460 --> 29:05.518
Who are you?

29:05.594 --> 29:08.529
- Sir, I am half owner of this house.
Who the hell are you?

29:08.597 --> 29:10.656
Inspector Hawking,
Scotland Yard.

29:10.733 --> 29:12.667
We'd better talk.

31:51.527 --> 31:54.360
Evening, governor.
What's your desire tonight?

31:54.430 --> 31:57.160
Desire?
What do you know of desire?

32:34.169 --> 32:35.227
Is that right?

32:36.839 --> 32:40.900
No.
I like it in the dark.

32:44.680 --> 32:49.845
The night is...
far too short as it is.

32:56.859 --> 32:58.019
You can take your time.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.291
Christine...

33:04.466 --> 33:05.865
My name is Maddie.

33:10.939 --> 33:16.343
Tonight... your name...
is Christine.

33:22.618 --> 33:25.109
There she is!
Bravo!

33:37.499 --> 33:38.898
She'll never sell tickets.

33:41.236 --> 33:42.897
It is my night.

33:44.473 --> 33:46.941
This is what I've always
dreamed of.

33:47.676 --> 33:51.339
Tonight, I didn't sing
with my voice. I don't know.

33:52.081 --> 33:55.539
It just came out.
It was a feeling...

33:56.885 --> 33:57.943
a passion.

33:59.355 --> 34:01.915
But it had to come from
somewhere.

34:01.990 --> 34:04.652
Is it such a secret
that you can't share it with me?

34:06.562 --> 34:12.056
My father...
sends an angel who teaches me.

34:13.068 --> 34:14.899
Who is this angel?
Introduce us.

34:16.338 --> 34:19.431
I've never seen him...
really.

34:19.507 --> 34:22.568
But I feel him,
and I hear him.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.235
He instructs me.

34:25.114 --> 34:29.277
What happened tonight --
I don't want to lose it.

34:29.351 --> 34:33.081
I don't want this feeling
ever to go away.

34:34.123 --> 34:36.181
I won't let it.

34:38.860 --> 34:41.694
I had a different sort of
evening planned, you know.

34:42.697 --> 34:44.427
What did you want to do?

34:45.634 --> 34:47.192
Ask you to marry me.

34:51.306 --> 34:55.743
Richard... I can't.
Not now.

34:55.811 --> 34:56.869
I know.

34:57.579 --> 34:59.308
I might have been
able to persuade you,

34:59.381 --> 35:02.111
but after this evening know I
may have lost you.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.819
You could never lose me.

35:13.295 --> 35:14.523
You owe me this favor.

35:14.596 --> 35:17.326
But your Miss Day
will be devastated.

35:17.399 --> 35:21.096
Perhaps she will
grow as an artist.

35:21.170 --> 35:23.104
I'm sure she will.

35:23.172 --> 35:26.369
Years and tears -- that's what
it needs. Years and tears.

35:26.442 --> 35:28.569
We must provide the public
with what they want,

35:28.644 --> 35:29.975
and they want Carlotta.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.036
Then with my help,
they shall have her.

35:35.017 --> 35:37.349
Sarah, more ale!

35:52.601 --> 35:54.091
How was the show,
sir?

35:54.169 --> 35:56.034
An inspiration.

36:16.859 --> 36:19.919
Why don't you introduce
us to your dark friend?

36:19.995 --> 36:22.156
He's a gentleman
who enjoys his privacy,

36:22.231 --> 36:24.631
Especially when he's composing.

36:24.700 --> 36:27.760
A gentleman... because he pays in gold?

36:28.470 --> 36:30.301
Perhaps he wagers in gold as well.

36:30.372 --> 36:32.863
Not with the likes of you,
you bastard.

36:35.544 --> 36:36.602
Can you hear it?

36:36.678 --> 36:37.736
What?

36:38.814 --> 36:40.475
Full pockets.

36:48.490 --> 36:50.014
Smoke?

36:50.092 --> 36:52.720
Go... away?

36:52.794 --> 36:54.125
I'm busy.

36:54.196 --> 36:56.255
I've seen you before.

36:56.331 --> 36:59.129
We've never actually
met proper...

37:00.802 --> 37:01.860
Have we?

37:05.173 --> 37:06.572
No.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.974
I never forget a face.

38:07.402 --> 38:10.462
Still hungry for an introduction?

38:11.473 --> 38:13.065
Just open your purse.

38:14.242 --> 38:16.176
And what will
you trade?

38:16.244 --> 38:19.008
steel... for gold.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.349
Hardly seems fair.

38:41.937 --> 38:44.428
Get in there!

39:03.058 --> 39:04.719
Get in there!

39:46.368 --> 39:47.960
This what you wanted?

39:50.739 --> 39:55.574
Now... I propose
a different bargain...

39:55.644 --> 39:59.842
And you shall die
a rich man.

40:03.051 --> 40:05.451
You're a thing from hell.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.978
And you, sir... are hellbound!

41:25.100 --> 41:26.590
Rotten morning.

41:30.272 --> 41:32.638
I've got to show this to Christine.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.902
- What's it say?
- Haven't read it yet.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.671
Did you get it?
Let me read it.

41:40.749 --> 41:44.048
I'll read it. You sit down
before you fall down.

41:44.119 --> 41:46.246
Too much wine for you,
missy.

41:47.055 --> 41:48.317
Meg!

41:48.390 --> 41:50.551
Meg, come on!

41:54.196 --> 41:56.721
Last night, the London
opera house and company

41:56.798 --> 41:59.858
opened the season
with their performance of "Faust."

41:59.935 --> 42:01.903
The gala was as
festive as anyone

42:01.970 --> 42:03.369
It's my first.
Let me read it.

42:03.438 --> 42:05.372
- I don't know.
- Meg!

42:12.581 --> 42:17.917
"unfortunately, the performance
did not fulfill all expectations

42:17.986 --> 42:23.014
"the most obvious reason was the
conspicuous absence of La Carlotta,

42:23.091 --> 42:24.888
the company's Diva."

42:28.463 --> 42:30.556
I don't understand.

42:34.369 --> 42:36.428
You shouldn't read that.
I mean, what does he know?

42:36.504 --> 42:40.998
"Young Christine Day could not sing
the role of Marguerite.

42:41.076 --> 42:44.978
"though her voice is not
completely unpleasant,

42:45.046 --> 42:47.776
"lack of discipline and
training show.

42:48.416 --> 42:50.976
"This humble reviewer
wonders...

42:51.052 --> 42:53.816
"... whether Miss Day has even
the substance

42:53.889 --> 42:57.381
"to fulfill the secondary
role of Cybil, as billed

42:57.459 --> 43:01.395
Oh, Christine.
It's only one opinion.

43:01.463 --> 43:04.591
The stupid bastard probably
wasn't even there.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.099
He was there!

43:06.902 --> 43:10.895
God. It was only
in my head.

43:10.972 --> 43:14.203
They loved you.
You heard them applaud.

43:14.276 --> 43:17.109
They would have been
embarrassed not to, Meg!

43:23.118 --> 43:24.949
Will you be having your
massage today?

43:25.020 --> 43:27.750
No, thank you.
Just a bath and steam.

43:46.608 --> 43:48.098
More steam?

43:49.644 --> 43:51.134
By all means.

43:53.515 --> 43:56.177
Could it be that I saw you at
the opera last night?

43:56.251 --> 43:59.743
It's quite possible.
I am the opera critic of the Gazette.

43:59.821 --> 44:01.152
Indeed.

44:01.222 --> 44:04.487
I found your account of Miss
Day's performance

44:04.559 --> 44:07.050
somewhat... troubling.

44:08.897 --> 44:12.162
Could it be that we
saw different shows?

44:12.901 --> 44:14.232
Aah, Miss Day.

44:14.302 --> 44:16.896
I was sorry for her --
embarrassed, really.

44:16.972 --> 44:18.462
The role was beyond her.

44:18.540 --> 44:20.371
Perhaps...

44:20.442 --> 44:23.275
... you weren't afforded a seat
befitting your status

44:23.345 --> 44:26.872
and your knowledge
of the arts.

44:26.948 --> 44:30.611
The acoustics are
somewhat inconsistent.

44:32.020 --> 44:35.183
Should you reconsider
your evaluation,

44:35.256 --> 44:39.386
I could provide you
with a private box.

44:39.461 --> 44:41.622
Sir, you flatter me,

44:41.696 --> 44:45.188
but in all truthfulness, I think
I'd rather die than subject myself

44:45.367 --> 44:48.302
to that shrieking child
for another evening.

44:49.104 --> 44:50.765
As you wish.

45:09.958 --> 45:13.018
Christine, wait.
Where are you going at this hour?

45:13.094 --> 45:14.925
I need to be alone.

45:24.339 --> 45:25.499
Driver!

45:39.654 --> 45:40.712
Wait!

46:28.736 --> 46:29.896
Father...

46:31.439 --> 46:33.907
I felt you last night.

46:35.410 --> 46:37.241
I know that you
were there.

46:38.980 --> 46:42.143
I don't know if I
can sing again.

46:44.619 --> 46:46.450
What do I do now?

46:57.899 --> 46:59.366
Father?

47:22.390 --> 47:24.119
Richard?

47:35.436 --> 47:38.462
Your father has sent me.

47:38.540 --> 47:40.701
I am your angel.

47:42.410 --> 47:46.813
All of your lessons have
led to this moment.

47:56.758 --> 48:00.250
We will make music that the
world will love forever.

48:01.729 --> 48:04.391
Take the last step to me...

48:06.801 --> 48:09.065
to your destiny...

48:10.972 --> 48:13.167
... to immortality.

49:01.389 --> 49:04.654
Here you are, you vermin.

49:05.927 --> 49:09.090
The old statue catch you?

49:09.998 --> 49:12.660
We'll put you in our bag,
we will.

49:33.855 --> 49:36.983
Please...
where are you taking me?

49:37.792 --> 49:39.054
Home.

49:46.401 --> 49:49.063
There is nothing to harm
you here.

50:17.932 --> 50:22.767
Up there... they see the actors,
the costumes, the scenery.

50:22.837 --> 50:25.169
They don't know the
soul of the opera.

50:28.810 --> 50:30.971
In your dressing room,

50:31.045 --> 50:34.446
I could only teach you the words,
the notes.

50:35.350 --> 50:38.376
But here...
here, I can,

50:39.220 --> 50:40.881
I can teach you
the meaning.

51:04.579 --> 51:05.739
What's the matter?

51:05.813 --> 51:08.145
Is this your name?

51:08.216 --> 51:09.706
Erik Destler?

51:11.152 --> 51:12.983
That... man is...

51:14.222 --> 51:15.883
... is long dead.

51:15.957 --> 51:18.289
But you wrote this.

51:18.359 --> 51:19.849
it is incomplete.

51:19.927 --> 51:22.589
- Play it.
- No. not, not that.

51:22.663 --> 51:24.221
Perhaps some Mozart.

51:24.298 --> 51:27.290
No. Play your music.

51:27.368 --> 51:29.029
Play.

51:37.945 --> 51:43.281
There is nothing you could ask...
that I could refuse.

51:53.528 --> 51:59.330
Christine... you...
are my inspiration to finish it.

52:26.614 --> 52:33.946
<i>♪ Your eyes see but my shadow</i>

52:34.101 --> 52:41.735
<i>♪ My heart is overflowing</i>

52:41.809 --> 52:50.978
<i>♪ There's so much you could hope to know </i>

52:51.052 --> 52:57.514
<i>♪ Your comfort is knowing</i>

52:57.592 --> 53:01.790
<i>♪ Tenderly</i>

53:01.863 --> 53:07.699
<i>♪ You could see</i>

53:07.768 --> 53:13.104
<i>♪ My soul</i>

53:31.926 --> 53:33.086
Libretto.

53:36.330 --> 53:40.266
How did you know
the words to my music?

53:41.936 --> 53:42.925
I...

53:44.071 --> 53:45.732
I-I sang them before.

53:48.976 --> 53:50.705
I don't remember where.

53:50.778 --> 53:53.713
It's impossible!
No one's heard that music.

53:53.781 --> 53:55.442
Please... play the rest.

53:55.516 --> 53:59.680
I have told you...
it is incomplete.

54:01.022 --> 54:03.684
Christine... you

54:04.792 --> 54:06.953
you are the angel.

54:07.028 --> 54:09.189
You are my voice.

54:10.364 --> 54:13.197
Together... together we'll
have London at our feet

54:18.573 --> 54:20.507
Christine...
come to me...

54:20.575 --> 54:23.305
And I will give
you everything.

54:26.614 --> 54:28.844
You love the music.

54:28.916 --> 54:31.851
I am the music.

54:35.022 --> 54:37.149
Our souls are one.

54:37.224 --> 54:39.158
No! No...

54:39.226 --> 54:41.592
Now! You are married
to the music.

54:42.697 --> 54:44.824
You cannot serve two masters.

54:45.900 --> 54:48.494
Do not see another.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.369
I promise.

55:07.521 --> 55:11.787
Tonight...
you will be my bride.

55:18.666 --> 55:20.827
Christine Day's life
is in danger.

55:20.901 --> 55:22.163
And yours isn't?

55:22.236 --> 55:25.128
A lot of people are dead, Mr. Dutton,
and the murderer is in your house.

55:25.224 --> 55:27.384
Inspector, will you please
keep your voice down?

55:28.676 --> 55:30.007
How's your stomach?

55:36.183 --> 55:37.241
Dear God.

55:37.318 --> 55:39.479
- They're all missing their...
- Skin.

55:41.255 --> 55:44.122
That's Joseph from your opera house.
Look at it.

55:46.027 --> 55:49.463
I fail to see the connection.
What's the point?

55:49.530 --> 55:51.862
Motive...
that's the point.

55:52.800 --> 55:56.258
Christine Day sang because your
Diva found a body in her closet.

55:56.337 --> 55:59.670
Harrison died because
he criticized her performance.

55:59.740 --> 56:03.232
Someone is doing murder in
Christine Day's name.

56:04.111 --> 56:06.944
and I understand the two of you
were very close.

56:10.785 --> 56:12.514
What are you saying, Inspector?

56:13.754 --> 56:15.813
Oh, I know it isn't you.

56:21.028 --> 56:23.758
so...
you know who it is, then?

56:23.831 --> 56:25.992
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Dutton?

56:26.067 --> 56:27.557
- Yes.
- Good.

56:28.502 --> 56:30.299
Because it's going to take
a leap of faith

56:30.371 --> 56:33.033
for you to understand
what I'm about to tell you.

56:33.908 --> 56:36.138
The phantom is real.

56:36.210 --> 56:37.734
It has a name...

56:37.812 --> 56:39.473
Erik Destler.

56:39.547 --> 56:41.538
But that's just a story.

56:41.615 --> 56:43.606
I know the legend
as well as you.

56:43.684 --> 56:47.848
He sold his soul to the devil so the
world would love him for his talent,

56:47.922 --> 56:49.412
but the devil had a price.

56:49.490 --> 56:52.084
He mutilated Destler's
face so terribly

56:52.159 --> 56:55.822
that no one could stand to love him
ever again for himself.

56:55.896 --> 57:00.422
And it's said the only way to kill
the phantom is to destroy his music.

57:01.235 --> 57:03.703
I don't believe in phantoms
or legends, Mr. Dutton,

57:03.771 --> 57:05.830
but I do believe in facts,

57:05.906 --> 57:10.707
and the fact is this man,
this creature, is still alive.

57:10.778 --> 57:14.305
Still alive,
and living under your opera.

58:51.946 --> 58:53.345
Do you want to tell me
where you've been?

58:53.414 --> 58:54.472
No.

58:55.316 --> 58:57.511
You look like you've
been through hell.

58:57.585 --> 58:59.644
- I have.
- He gave you a ring!

58:59.720 --> 59:01.119
- Who?
- Richard, of course.

59:01.188 --> 59:03.349
I expected at least
a diamond.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.449
Richard didn't
give me the ring.

59:10.431 --> 59:11.591
Christine?

59:12.700 --> 59:15.897
I've been your friend for a long time.
Am I missing something?

59:19.740 --> 59:21.298
I guess you know
about Harrison.

59:21.375 --> 59:24.469
What's there to know?
He hated me, Meg.

59:24.545 --> 59:25.705
You haven't heard?

59:25.779 --> 59:28.475
Someone's killed the bastard.
It's all anyone's taking about.

59:28.549 --> 59:32.110
Oh, my God.
I can't stay here.

59:37.558 --> 59:38.616
It's Richard.

59:41.528 --> 59:45.259
Vinegar!
Buy your precious Vinegar

59:48.903 --> 59:50.165
He's in danger.

59:51.505 --> 59:52.836
Christine...

59:54.842 --> 59:57.242
but you have to make an appearance
at the ball tonight.

59:59.213 --> 01:00:01.238
Richard can't be
seen with me.

01:00:01.315 --> 01:00:04.375
- He's coming.
- Here. Give this to him.

01:00:04.451 --> 01:00:06.681
Don't tell him I'm here.
I beg of you.

01:00:09.423 --> 01:00:12.915
Sir, can't you read?
This is a proper house for ladies.

01:00:12.993 --> 01:00:14.654
I must speak with
Miss Day.

01:00:14.728 --> 01:00:16.218
Meg. I must see her.

01:00:16.297 --> 01:00:17.787
- She's not here.
- She's not?

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:19.457
She asked me to give
you this.

01:00:20.868 --> 01:00:22.699
- So you have seen her?
- Yes.

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:24.761
Yes, this morning.
She's fine.

01:00:26.774 --> 01:00:28.264
No, she's not, Meg.

01:00:32.579 --> 01:00:34.513
She's in a great
deal of danger.

01:00:52.466 --> 01:00:53.626
Madam.

01:01:07.181 --> 01:01:10.173
My dear lady Robly.
It's a shame to hide your beauty.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.410
Scandalous party?

01:01:11.485 --> 01:01:13.885
Perhaps you and lord Robly
can help us make it so.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.260
- Has Christine arrived, then?
- Christine?

01:01:24.331 --> 01:01:25.730
Splendid.

01:01:25.799 --> 01:01:27.198
How would I know,
in this crowd?

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:30.259
There are prospects here by the dozen.
Go and have some fun.

01:01:30.337 --> 01:01:31.599
- Sr. Dutton.
- Sr. Barton.

01:01:31.672 --> 01:01:35.335
Perhaps kicking your ass, then,
would brighten my spirits.

01:01:36.677 --> 01:01:38.008
- Delightful.
- Quite.

01:01:38.078 --> 01:01:41.309
Mr. Barton, you wicked man

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:12.309
I do believe you're the
goddess Aphrodite.

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:14.803
Oh, thank you so much.

01:02:14.882 --> 01:02:16.816
My dear Carlotta.

01:02:18.218 --> 01:02:19.879
You have given me away, sir.

01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:21.614
I must have a dance.

01:02:21.688 --> 01:02:23.178
Perhaps later.

01:02:23.257 --> 01:02:26.522
I was never rich in patience
when faced with such beauty.

01:02:26.593 --> 01:02:27.855
Please excuse us.

01:02:31.131 --> 01:02:32.723
No alcohol, Davies.

01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:35.930
And keep your eyes
off the women.

01:02:37.871 --> 01:02:40.271
Don't worry.
If he's here, we'll get him.

01:02:48.715 --> 01:02:50.205
- Christine.
- Richard.

01:02:50.284 --> 01:02:52.616
- He might see us.
- Who?

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.621
Christine, this angel of yours --
he's the phantom

01:02:55.624 --> 01:02:59.785
No, he's everywhere. He's in the walls.
I'm afraid that he can hear us.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.350
Don't be afraid.

01:03:01.428 --> 01:03:03.157
He'll find me.

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:04.663
I love you, Richard.

01:03:10.838 --> 01:03:12.430
I'll go find us a coach.

01:03:13.507 --> 01:03:17.341
By tomorrow morning,
this will all be behind us.

01:03:33.961 --> 01:03:36.122
You're very
forward tonight.

01:03:36.196 --> 01:03:39.029
My will is weak and my resolve
strong where you're concerned.

01:03:39.099 --> 01:03:41.499
It's a magic night.
Anything can happen.

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:45.629
Perhaps we may consummate a personal
union with our, uh, professional one

01:03:51.645 --> 01:03:53.135
Who is this man?

01:03:54.348 --> 01:03:55.747
I must know.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.511
You must not.

01:04:02.723 --> 01:04:04.554
Who could that be?

01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:15.028
- Sir!
- We will have another.

01:04:16.136 --> 01:04:17.569
Dance.

01:04:33.687 --> 01:04:36.019
You are a wonderful dancer.

01:04:36.823 --> 01:04:38.222
Do I know you?

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:40.260
By my works.

01:04:40.928 --> 01:04:43.658
I can't stand it.
I have to see your face.

01:04:46.833 --> 01:04:48.767
And what will you trade?

01:04:52.272 --> 01:04:53.933
Everything has its price.

01:05:08.689 --> 01:05:11.419
What will I think
when I see you?

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:17.153
You'll just... die.

01:05:33.914 --> 01:05:35.643
Original costume.

01:05:35.716 --> 01:05:39.880
The thing you're looking for has already
come and gone, right under your nose.

01:05:41.955 --> 01:05:43.923
Show me where he lives.

01:05:43.991 --> 01:05:45.982
Where he had the girl,
you mean.

01:05:46.059 --> 01:05:47.583
It's unholy.

01:05:47.661 --> 01:05:49.925
I heard them
singing together.

01:05:51.465 --> 01:05:53.797
He pays me well to
keep his secrets,

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.596
and to keep the rats out.

01:05:55.669 --> 01:05:57.159
I'll pay you more.

01:05:59.506 --> 01:06:00.666
Show me!

01:06:12.653 --> 01:06:15.315
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:18.324
If you please,
we have the canard l'orange.

01:06:19.993 --> 01:06:23.724
Croissant citron with
white wine sauce.

01:06:23.797 --> 01:06:27.528
head of wild boar stuffed
with pâté of truffle.

01:06:31.705 --> 01:06:34.503
The soup tonight is...

01:06:54.294 --> 01:06:56.228
Carlotta!

01:07:05.405 --> 01:07:06.895
No, please!

01:07:15.982 --> 01:07:18.143
Damn it! He's got her.

01:07:18.218 --> 01:07:19.276
Come on.

01:07:20.654 --> 01:07:21.985
No!

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:25.324
He's gone down.

01:07:28.895 --> 01:07:30.055
Go on.

01:07:41.108 --> 01:07:44.544
Faithfulness is not
a quality

01:07:44.611 --> 01:07:47.603
I admire in you, Christine.

01:07:52.018 --> 01:07:54.782
Desire is only a demon,
Christine.

01:07:54.855 --> 01:07:57.790
How does getting what
you desire ever --

01:07:57.858 --> 01:07:59.052
No, please.
Let me go.

01:07:59.126 --> 01:08:01.924
You will never
leave here again.

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:03.053
Ever!

01:08:12.506 --> 01:08:14.201
You can never leave.

01:08:17.411 --> 01:08:18.604
He lives here?

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:23.973
Not here. Below the prison --
below the sewer,

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:25.711
deep down.

01:08:27.554 --> 01:08:28.612
Davies.

01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:39.366
Now are you ready to believe me?

01:08:40.018 --> 01:08:42.023
I will believe when
I find Christine.

01:08:45.604 --> 01:08:48.130
This is police business.
You don't have to go.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.698
Stop me!

01:08:58.587 --> 01:08:59.834
You wait a damn minute.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.546
I'll show you the way.

01:09:04.758 --> 01:09:10.787
But if I don't clear the rats out,
none of us will make it very far.

01:09:10.863 --> 01:09:13.389
Just stay to the right.

01:09:13.466 --> 01:09:15.526
And keep going down.

01:09:15.602 --> 01:09:18.002
Down, down.

01:09:18.872 --> 01:09:21.033
We'll catch you.

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:27.509
Help me!

01:09:27.848 --> 01:09:30.645
Please!
Somebody help me!

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:05.770
You are an
unholy thing.

01:11:06.813 --> 01:11:10.305
I heard you singing
with the girl.

01:11:10.383 --> 01:11:12.214
Better your hearing
had failed you.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.252
You won't kill me.

01:11:17.462 --> 01:11:21.306
I lead the rats
away, drown them.

01:11:21.932 --> 01:11:25.550
Without me, you'll have
them crawling all over you.

01:11:26.733 --> 01:11:30.191
Then lead them...
to eternity!

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.001
What was that?

01:11:35.075 --> 01:11:37.669
Where?
That's the question.

01:11:37.744 --> 01:11:40.474
Damn it. There must be 100 miles
of tunnels down here.

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:45.481
Davies. Morris.

01:11:47.454 --> 01:11:50.855
You go this way.
Keep to your right. Mark your path.

01:11:50.924 --> 01:11:54.257
We should meet up. If we don't,
follow your marks back here

01:11:54.327 --> 01:11:55.589
Now move!

01:11:55.662 --> 01:11:56.924
Take care.

01:11:58.965 --> 01:12:00.296
We'll go this way.

01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:03.405
- Keep an eye out.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:08.835 --> 01:13:09.995
Morris!

01:13:45.405 --> 01:13:46.565
Not there.

01:14:09.729 --> 01:14:10.855
here I am.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.880
Inspector!

01:14:57.377 --> 01:14:59.368
Inspector!

01:15:35.248 --> 01:15:37.182
He's stalking us.

01:15:39.419 --> 01:15:41.751
Then let's not be easy prey.

01:15:58.404 --> 01:16:00.599
Are you going to kill me now?

01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:03.270
Everyone dies.

01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:06.901
I only choose the time
and place for a few.

01:16:08.414 --> 01:16:11.406
When do you choose...
for me?

01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:21.754
This is either a wedding march
or a funeral mass.

01:16:22.595 --> 01:16:24.825
You decide which.

01:16:36.576 --> 01:16:39.067
This way.
It's coming from down here.

01:16:40.113 --> 01:16:41.603
It's an entrance.

01:16:59.666 --> 01:17:00.826
Come here.

01:17:35.468 --> 01:17:36.867
Watch your skin.

01:20:09.789 --> 01:20:14.624
I told you.
you will never leave here!

01:20:32.211 --> 01:20:38.707
Only love... and music...
are forever.

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.204
Come... with me.

01:21:39.779 --> 01:21:43.112
Come back!!

01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:54.456
Oh, my god!
Chris!

01:21:54.527 --> 01:21:55.858
Chris, are you okay?

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:59.222
You could have
killed somebody!

01:21:59.298 --> 01:22:01.027
- I'm sorry.
- Chris, come on.

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:03.591
Chris?
You're going to be okay.

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:04.931
What happened?

01:22:07.406 --> 01:22:08.634
Is she all right?

01:22:08.708 --> 01:22:11.199
Excuse me.
Let me through, please!

01:22:13.446 --> 01:22:14.504
She all right?

01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:19.110
Who are you?

01:22:20.953 --> 01:22:23.547
A very relieved admirer.

01:22:23.623 --> 01:22:25.784
I thought we lost the star of our
show there for a minute.

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:29.658
This is Mr. Foster, Miss Day,
our producer and Major Backer.

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:32.455
Well, I guess that makes
me an authority

01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:34.692
on how you'll be spending
your time for a while.

01:22:35.801 --> 01:22:37.860
I don't understand.

01:22:39.005 --> 01:22:40.165
Excuse me.

01:22:41.307 --> 01:22:44.970
Christine...
the part is yours.

01:22:47.413 --> 01:22:51.247
Unless, of course, uh...
you've changed your mind.

01:22:51.317 --> 01:22:55.344
Don't say another word, Chris.
I-I represent Miss Day

01:22:55.421 --> 01:22:58.584
And before we go any further, I-I would
like to have something in writing.

01:22:58.658 --> 01:23:00.717
You will have it in writing.
Don't you worry.

01:23:00.793 --> 01:23:02.624
Come on over here.
We'll have a coffee.

01:23:02.695 --> 01:23:04.162
Are you sure you're okay?

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:05.959
I'm a little shaky.

01:23:06.866 --> 01:23:09.699
You, uh... you look like you
could use a drink.

01:23:09.769 --> 01:23:12.897
They'll be haggling terms
in there for hours.

01:23:14.273 --> 01:23:17.868
I toast you, Christine.
you'll have all New York at your feet.

01:23:17.943 --> 01:23:19.001
Thank you.

01:23:19.078 --> 01:23:21.046
Now then,
I would like you to join me

01:23:21.113 --> 01:23:24.514
at a small dinner with the other
backers of the show, all right?

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:25.982
Give me a few minutes
to change,

01:23:26.052 --> 01:23:28.919
And I promise you an evening on the
town you will not forget.

01:23:28.988 --> 01:23:30.922
Maybe I should
freshen up.

01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:34.585
No, no, no, no. you're perfect. I must
put on a tie, though. Five minutes.

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:36.287
Make yourself at home.

01:24:01.053 --> 01:24:02.213
Damn.

01:24:44.296 --> 01:24:45.888
Oh, my god.

01:25:10.523 --> 01:25:11.512
Oh, my god.

01:25:26.405 --> 01:25:28.100
Come on, come on.

01:25:30.443 --> 01:25:31.603
Stop. stop.

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:34.034
Damn.

01:25:36.415 --> 01:25:37.541
So...

01:25:37.616 --> 01:25:39.379
How do you like it?

01:25:39.452 --> 01:25:41.283
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean --

01:25:41.353 --> 01:25:43.514
I knew we'd find
each other.

01:25:45.024 --> 01:25:48.187
Love...
music...

01:25:49.462 --> 01:25:50.793
They're forever.

01:25:56.168 --> 01:25:57.658
You're him...

01:25:59.205 --> 01:26:00.263
Aren't you?

01:26:01.507 --> 01:26:03.975
Had you expected someone else?

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.343
You've always been my inspiration,
Christine.

01:26:12.685 --> 01:26:16.348
You... made it all possible,
Christine.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:19.352
You.

01:26:24.663 --> 01:26:28.690
Now... it's just a matter

01:26:28.767 --> 01:26:30.894
of what you choose.

01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:33.939
Love...
or music.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.011
I have waited
a very long time

01:27:18.083 --> 01:27:21.109
for you to come back to me,
my dear.

01:27:23.889 --> 01:27:25.823
We had a bargain,
remember?

01:27:26.692 --> 01:27:27.750
Forever!

01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:36.998
Forever.

01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:40.634
Not forever!

01:27:53.953 --> 01:27:55.011
Yes!

01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:59.380
It's over.

01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:06.721
Not my music.

01:28:07.305 --> 01:28:13.522
