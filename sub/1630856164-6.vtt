WEBVTT

00:12.303 --> 00:14.389
How you doing? You okay?

00:14.431 --> 00:15.515
It's hard.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.766
I know.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.893
He was the closest thing
I had to a father.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.895
You ever tell him that?

00:20.979 --> 00:22.063
No.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.815
Well, tell him now.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.151
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.741
Hey, Teddy.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.703
I-I can't. There's people.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.663
Uh, can everyone please back up?

00:38.747 --> 00:39.998
Yeah.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.458
Hey, you heard her.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.084
Colavito's trying to
have a private moment

00:43.168 --> 00:44.502
with the deceased.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.713
Go.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.298
Thanks.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.593
Just the highlights,
though, huh? I gotta piddle.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.766
Just wanted to thank you
for teaching me

00:57.849 --> 00:59.267
how to run a book.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.395
Keep going.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.813
But more importantly,

01:04.855 --> 01:07.192
how to be a stand-up guy.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.235
I love you, Teddy.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.237
I'll miss you forever.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.491
-You're up.
-Yeah.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.242
Good job.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.870
Teddy, I outlived you.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.206
I win. Okay.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.248
Excuse me.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.792
Did you pay your respects?

01:23.875 --> 01:26.002
Yeah, man, you know
I don't do dead bodies.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.837
-Grow up.
-You grow up.

01:27.879 --> 01:28.922
All right.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.924
I'm very proud of you.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.676
Thanks.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.513
When I got out of prison, uh,

01:36.554 --> 01:38.973
Teddy took me in
and showed me the ropes.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.810
Least he could do after he
turned his fuckin' back on us.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.229
-Lorraine, not now, not here.
-Then where?

01:44.312 --> 01:46.064
Am I the only one that remembers

01:46.146 --> 01:48.233
he had no room for us
after Mom died?

01:48.316 --> 01:50.151
His baby sister?

01:50.193 --> 01:52.779
He regretted that, believe me.
Oh, did he?

01:52.862 --> 01:55.532
Did he end up in a foster home
with a creepy foster dad

01:55.573 --> 01:57.366
who bought him
hot pants for Christmas?

01:57.408 --> 01:59.327
How much did she have to drink?

01:59.411 --> 02:01.287
I had to wear those things
and serve him a Rob Roy

02:01.371 --> 02:03.039
when he came home from work.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.125
-Keep your voice down.
-I was 12.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.167
Come on, let's go
get some food in you.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.502
-12.
-Come here.

02:09.294 --> 02:10.880
What's a Rob Roy?

02:11.923 --> 02:13.591
That's what you got from that?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.677
♪ ♪

02:23.685 --> 02:26.021
We are here today
to honor a great bookie

02:26.103 --> 02:27.897
and a great man.

02:27.939 --> 02:31.443
A man who went the extra mile
for the people in his life.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.738
True story, hand to God.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.281
I once found myself

02:37.365 --> 02:39.075
in a bit of a pickle

02:39.117 --> 02:40.493
with some very bad people.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.370
(clears throat) Armenians.

02:44.079 --> 02:45.874
And that man there

02:45.957 --> 02:47.917
walked into a warehouse

02:47.959 --> 02:52.172
within which I was
hanging upside down,

02:52.255 --> 02:53.465
and posted the 30 grand

02:53.548 --> 02:55.633
that allowed for
my eventual release.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.473
What with the interest and all,

03:01.514 --> 03:04.309
I wound up paying him $112,000.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.772
But it sure as hell beat
the taste of my own genitals.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.608
Thank you.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.111
Joe Namath wasn't the only one

03:15.153 --> 03:16.905
who predicted the Jets

03:16.988 --> 03:18.656
would win Super Bowl III.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.160
That man there in the box

03:22.202 --> 03:24.746
had a hunch.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.581
And he was decent enough

03:26.664 --> 03:29.209
to share it with
a struggling single mom

03:29.292 --> 03:31.544
who desperately needed a big win

03:31.628 --> 03:35.840
to pay for her son's back brace.
(chuckles)

03:35.882 --> 03:37.884
The Colts lost that day.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.763
And so did scoliosis.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.598
Before I met Teddy,

03:43.682 --> 03:47.519
I lived my life
with a shameful secret.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.020
While on the outside,

03:49.062 --> 03:52.524
I was a nice Jewish boy
from Philadelphia,

03:52.565 --> 03:55.442
on the inside,
I was Robert Duvall

03:55.527 --> 03:57.696
from Lonesome Dove.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.948
Until one day,

04:00.031 --> 04:03.201
Teddy dropped by my shop to
fence a silver tea set.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.203
I didn't ask him
where it came from.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.705
We haggled,
we settled on a price,

04:06.788 --> 04:09.124
and then, for some reason
I don't understand,

04:09.207 --> 04:10.333
I told him the whole story.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.544
How I was keeping a secret horse

04:12.585 --> 04:14.295
up in Simi Valley,

04:14.337 --> 04:16.380
and on the sabbath,
when my family thought

04:16.464 --> 04:19.175
I was praying at shul,
I was riding Ginger

04:19.216 --> 04:20.719
in the hills
above Magic Mountain.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.763
And you know
what Teddy said to me?

04:23.847 --> 04:27.600
He said, "Irving,
why do you keep fighting

04:27.684 --> 04:29.436
"what God wants you to be?

04:29.519 --> 04:32.564
It's time you lived your truth."

04:32.647 --> 04:35.400
And from that day forward,

04:35.442 --> 04:37.777
that is what I did.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.407
Teddy, happy trails, compadre.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.327
Until we meet again.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.329
You know, I-I want to
grieve for Teddy.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.915
I do. But I can't.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.876
And I'll tell you why.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.254
Part of me envies him.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.173
He's the lucky one.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.342
He got out at the right time.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.762
Before Draft Kings and Fan Duel,
pardon my French,

05:03.803 --> 05:05.597
stuck their corporate dicks
up the ass

05:05.680 --> 05:08.516
of every decent God-fearing
bookie in America.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.770
Teddy, you were always
two moves ahead.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.900
And dying the slow,
agonizing way you did proves it.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.279
Thank you.

05:22.072 --> 05:26.743
A lot of amazing things
were said about my dad today.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.536
I learned a lot.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.163
For starters,
that he was capable of love.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.498
You know, I wouldn't know that

05:31.581 --> 05:32.499
because I was
an embarrassment to him.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.125
Viggy, don't. Please.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.835
VIGGY:
That's another thing.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.379
He named me Viggy.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.672
As in "vigorish,"

05:38.755 --> 05:40.215
the juice you place on a bet.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.758
I'm begging you.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.968
VIGGY:
And you let him.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.553
You let him send me away
to military school

05:45.637 --> 05:47.597
so they could
make a man out of me.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.308
Well, guess what?
The joke's on him.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.643
I found my people there.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.478
At the George Patton
Army Academy,

05:53.520 --> 05:55.647
they had a vibrant
queer community.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.233
And the uniforms were spiffy!

05:58.316 --> 05:59.526
You're the best, Papi!

05:59.609 --> 06:01.152
Thank you, baby.

06:02.070 --> 06:06.533
I could stand here and say
I'm gonna miss my father...

06:07.784 --> 06:09.953
...but I've been missing him
my whole life.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.079
Fuck yeah!

06:13.289 --> 06:14.874
Come on, baby.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.460
Good job.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.714
I met Teddy when I was hooking

06:20.797 --> 06:24.175
over at the Spread Eagle Ranch
in Pahrump, Nevada.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.593
And unlike Julia Roberts,

06:25.677 --> 06:28.430
I didn't have a heart of gold.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.933
First time I shtupped Teddy,

06:32.017 --> 06:35.353
I stole his watch
and his Diner's Club card.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.356
But unperturbed...

06:38.398 --> 06:41.484
he kept coming back.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.112
And eventually,

06:44.195 --> 06:46.698
he stole my heart.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.576
But more important,

06:49.659 --> 06:51.077
made things right
with the Genovese family

06:51.161 --> 06:54.622
so I could, you know, leave.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.707
I want her to be my mother.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.586
-They broke the mold
with that one.
-Yeah.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.463
I'm so sorry I smoked
and I took diet pills

07:01.546 --> 07:04.132
when I was pregnant with Viggy.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.925
But we didn't know back then.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.056
Why in the fuck
would you buy a boat?

07:11.097 --> 07:12.724
WALT:
First of all, I didn't buy it.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.642
I took it in trade.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.729
If it flies, floats or fucks,
lease it.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.065
Come on,
I taught you guys that shit.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.566
Second of all,

07:21.649 --> 07:24.486
if you take bets
three miles offshore,

07:24.569 --> 07:26.905
you're in international waters.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.573
And, best part,

07:28.615 --> 07:31.534
outside the reach
of the local gendarmes. Ha-ha.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.911
What about the Coast Guard?

07:32.994 --> 07:35.622
What about 'em?
I've broken no laws.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.541
I'm just a man
with sunscreen on his nose

07:38.582 --> 07:40.085
trying to catch a mahi

07:40.168 --> 07:42.253
or, you know, some kind
of trout. I don't know.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.963
No trout in the ocean.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.591
Big picture, bubbie.
Big picture.

07:46.633 --> 07:50.637
The point is I've created
an offshore sports book,

07:50.720 --> 07:53.598
and you guys need to buy in.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.267
You want us to buy
a part of your boat?

07:56.351 --> 07:57.602
The dream.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.771
I want you to buy
part of the dream.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.524
-What's going on?
-Oh, imagine this one

08:02.607 --> 08:04.317
in a bikini, all greased up,

08:04.401 --> 08:06.528
sunning herself on the aft deck.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.779
Up periscope,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.406
-right?
-Walt, tone it down.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.366
Too much?

08:11.449 --> 08:12.909
E-Excuse me?

08:12.951 --> 08:15.328
I was told I could
place a bet with you.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.122
Really? Now?

08:18.415 --> 08:19.541
Sure. Who do you like?

08:19.624 --> 08:22.293
Ah, Milwaukee Braves.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.462
You mean Atlanta.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.257
No. Milwaukee.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.968
Lew Burdette.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.386
Put me down
for a double sawbuck.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.389
No, no. Your credit's good here.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.307
Oh.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.226
-Thanks, kid.
-Good luck.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.227
WALT:
Wow.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.479
That was very classy.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.440
Eh, I learned from the best.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.066
Hey. You know what?

08:45.150 --> 08:47.569
We could call the boat
the Classy Danny, huh?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.195
-Okay, you ready to go?
-Yeah.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.156
Anchors away.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.241
VIGGY:
Yo, Danny.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.826
How come no eulogy?

08:54.909 --> 08:56.244
I couldn't. I'm sorry.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.412
VIGGY:
I'm surprised,

08:57.495 --> 08:58.663
you were more like a son to him

08:58.747 --> 08:59.748
than I ever was.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.499
Nah, listen, I feel bad

09:01.541 --> 09:03.168
hearing all you went through.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.003
You know, different generation,
not accepting of your

09:05.045 --> 09:07.172
alternate whatever
the fuck you do.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.506
(Viggy scoffs)

09:08.548 --> 09:09.841
Blood under the bridge.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.177
So listen, uh, you know,
the 20% gross

09:12.218 --> 09:14.471
you were paying to my father,
we're gonna keep that going.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.847
To who?

09:16.848 --> 09:19.851
-To me.
-(laughing): This fucking guy.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.313
I don't think so.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.356
Your father gave me the book.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.857
I owed him, not you.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.275
Well, first of all,
the book should've gone

09:27.359 --> 09:28.443
to his genetical son.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.778
-Genetical?
-(chuckles)

09:29.861 --> 09:32.364
DANNY:
Well, shoulda woulda coulda,

09:32.447 --> 09:35.116
but he gave it to me, Vigorish.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.785
And I paid the 20%

09:36.868 --> 09:39.412
for 18 years without fail.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.414
And you're gonna keep paying it.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.333
And when I'm dead,

09:43.375 --> 09:45.418
you're gonna pay my child.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.836
You two have a kid?

09:46.878 --> 09:48.713
We're gonna adopt.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.757
Korea, you can buy them in bulk.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.802
Well, I got an idea.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.762
Why don't you get a job
for the first time

09:55.845 --> 09:58.056
in your motherfuckin' life?

09:58.139 --> 09:59.724
RAY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.226
We don't want to do this here.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.436
I could kill you
so easy right now.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.729
But you'd have to kill me first.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.356
Okay, this is where we leave.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.399
Hang on, hang on.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.234
No, walk with me.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.362
Thoughts and prayers.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.865
20% every week.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.659
DANNY:
Fuck off.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.952
Whew.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.412
My God.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.288
Oh, look at me.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.708
I'm shpritzing over here.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.097
(door buzzes)

10:39.889 --> 10:42.100
-Guisados.
-Gotta go.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.852
Be right down.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.981
Tacos, tacos, tacos.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.444
-Hello.
-Wha...

10:52.527 --> 10:54.446
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.116
We don't carry cash
on the premises.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.034
Shh, shh, shh.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.285
We're not here for your money.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.495
Okay.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.205
How may I help you?

11:04.289 --> 11:08.293
Tell Danny to
do the right thing, okay?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.378
You betcha. Do you wanna
leave a name or a card?

11:10.462 --> 11:11.755
(laughs) He'll know.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.215
Here you go. (laughs) Bye.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.343
Enjoy your lunch.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.098
What's wrong with me
that I'm still hungry?

11:23.641 --> 11:25.810
I'm telling you,
we gotta strap up.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.021
Hit the mattresses.
This is war, baby.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.481
All right, all right, calm down.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.066
No, no, no, no.
They started this fight

11:31.149 --> 11:32.567
and I'm fucking finishing it.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.152
You got a little Tapatío
right there.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.740
So, what's the plan?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.370
What're you looking at me for?

11:43.453 --> 11:45.372
-Who should we look at?
-Maybe me and you

11:45.455 --> 11:46.831
should have
a sit-down with Viggy.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.124
Don't forget the other guy.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.501
I swear to God, he had a boner

11:49.584 --> 11:50.919
when he was strangling my neck.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.299
We're not gonna talk to Viggy.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.926
Then who?

11:58.009 --> 12:01.346
The one person in this world
he's truly afraid of.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.847
Come on in, fellas.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.725
I got ziti, I got Entenmann's.
We'll talk.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.769
Thanks, Nancy.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.107
-What are you drinking?
-Uh, water's fine.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.526
-Yeah, sure.
-(chuckles) Fuck you.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.777
Juanita!

12:15.860 --> 12:17.696
Make a couple of screwdrivers,

12:17.779 --> 12:20.365
and put them
in those big glasses.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.995
I am very sorry
about this, fellas.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.455
Well, out of respect
to your husband,

12:27.539 --> 12:30.417
I wanted to come to you
before we respond.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.210
You got a response?

12:33.712 --> 12:34.879
(exhales)

12:34.921 --> 12:36.881
What I thought.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.971
-VIGGY (over phone): Yeah?
-Viggy, it's your mother.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.514
Can I call you back?
This isn't a good time.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.266
Shut up and listen.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.561
You and Marco are gonna stand
down on this Danny nonsense.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.229
Okay, how do you know
about that?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.732
He honored the deal
with your father.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.608
-That's the end of that.
-Mom.

12:55.692 --> 12:59.571
Leave Danny and Tall, Dark
and Handsome alone.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.323
Ugh. Okay.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.118
You coming to dinner?

13:05.201 --> 13:08.371
-Chicken Kiev.
-Can Marco come?

13:08.413 --> 13:10.290
Oh, for God's sakes.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.917
Okay, can you just tell him
to eat with his mouth closed?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.502
He was a kickboxer, Mom.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.421
He can't breathe
through his nose.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.759
Okay, fine. I love you. Bye.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.261
Drink up.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.889
He won't give you
any more trouble.

13:25.930 --> 13:26.931
-Salud.
-Salud.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.433
Salud.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.687
Juanita!

13:32.771 --> 13:35.106
We're ready for the scungilli!

13:37.859 --> 13:39.778
(laughs):
I can't.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.906
No, I can't.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.575
Okay, fine.

13:45.617 --> 13:49.996
I'm wearing a black, lacy bra
and a G-string.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.040
It's panties, you fool.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.126
What are you wearing?

13:55.210 --> 13:57.545
Dungarees
and a lumberjack shirt?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.964
What part of that is
supposed to get me going?

14:00.048 --> 14:01.966
We celebrating, Grandma.
Whoo!

14:02.008 --> 14:03.718
Not now, Rayfield.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.220
Hey, I'm moving you
out of this dump

14:05.303 --> 14:07.472
and getting you back
to Brentwood.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.725
Frank, you're on your own.
For real?

14:10.809 --> 14:14.479
For real. My piece of the book
just got a whole lot bigger.

14:14.562 --> 14:18.191
-Oh, Rayfield, that's wonderful.
-Mm-hmm.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.651
So, first thing tomorrow,

14:19.734 --> 14:21.486
we gonna find a realtor
and start looking.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.530
Can we get something
with a big backyard?

14:23.613 --> 14:24.989
Whatever you want.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.742
We're gonna need lots of space
for tables

14:27.826 --> 14:29.244
-and a dance floor.
-For what?

14:29.327 --> 14:31.162
Frank asked me to marry him.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.164
I mean, we were thinking June,
but...

14:33.206 --> 14:35.542
who knows if we'll be alive,
so maybe sooner.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.003
Grandma, you've been seeing this
man for, what, three weeks?

14:38.086 --> 14:40.505
It's a little more complicated.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.882
-Come on, sit down.
-Just tell me.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.343
Sit.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.264
(exhales)

14:49.347 --> 14:51.182
Uh...

14:51.266 --> 14:54.060
Forty-two
and one-half years ago,

14:54.144 --> 14:56.771
God tested Frank and I...

14:56.855 --> 14:59.315
-and we failed.
-Okay, that's enough.
You ain't got to tell me...

14:59.357 --> 15:02.527
-No, no.
You need to hear it all.
-Uh-huh.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.822
Francine, his wife,
was my best friend.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.449
(groans)

15:07.532 --> 15:11.619
She was a deep sleeper,
and we took full advantage.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.705
Ugh. God.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.499
I betrayed her trust,

15:16.541 --> 15:20.045
and I've been carrying
that guilt all these years.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.341
How do you make that right?

15:24.382 --> 15:25.800
Well, you don't.

15:25.884 --> 15:29.262
You just live your life
knowing that you're a sinner.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.932
You think less of me?

15:33.016 --> 15:35.268
No.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.064
Just makes you human.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.149
Thank you.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.318
Now, do I get to walk you
down that aisle?

15:43.401 --> 15:46.071
-You better.
-(chuckles)

15:46.154 --> 15:48.948
Pop that cork.
I'm-a go get the gummy bears.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.658
Ooh! Yes.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.662
JEFFREY:
Know what I love
about this place?

15:54.746 --> 15:56.164
The bacteria?

15:56.247 --> 15:58.750
How tired they are
when you take them home.

15:58.833 --> 16:02.754
My guy will be asleep
before we get on the freeway.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.922
Divorced?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.882
Nope. Stepdad.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.927
JEFFREY:
Oh, man, you're going
for some bonus points.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.596
You'd think they'd have some
monitors here so we could watch

16:11.638 --> 16:15.225
Michigan-Ohio State instead
of our kids getting Ebola.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.102
You enjoy college football?

16:17.185 --> 16:20.021
Maybe a little too much.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.024
You wouldn't happen to know
what the line on the game is?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.278
As a matter of fact, I would.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.115
(entry bell chimes)

16:31.491 --> 16:33.451
There she is.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.619
What do you want?

16:34.703 --> 16:36.788
Is that any way
to talk to a customer?

16:37.831 --> 16:40.875
I'm just here shopping
for a gift for my mommy.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.627
Oh.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.464
These look nice.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.675
(gasps softly)

16:51.886 --> 16:53.763
The middle's where you get
the bigger bounce.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.932
No, I'm-I'm good where I am.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.059
(phone ringing)

17:00.311 --> 17:03.648
Hey! Check it out.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.733
I'm on a trampoline.

17:05.817 --> 17:09.904
Anthony, do your stuff
for your mom.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.198
Oh, wow, look at you.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.160
Danny, turn the phone around.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.829
-Viggy's here.
-What?

17:18.872 --> 17:20.832
-And his husband. He...
-Give me the phone.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.960
Hey, asshole.
You go to my mother?

17:24.002 --> 17:26.671
-What the fuck do you want?
-I want what's mine.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.633
Otherwise, this is what's
gonna happen to what's yours.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.887
Okay, stop. Stop.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.889
-Thirty percent.
-Twenty.

17:35.972 --> 17:39.017
You're negotiating?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.477
(shatters)

17:41.895 --> 17:44.022
Fine. You win.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.899
Just get the fuck out of there.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.609
VIGGY:
I expect an envelope
every Tuesday

17:47.692 --> 17:49.652
and every Tuesday thereafter.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.282
(whispers):
Can I keep this one?

17:54.366 --> 17:57.202
Oh. Of course you can, baby.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.788
He collects unicorns.
(chuckles)

17:59.871 --> 18:02.040
So cute. Come on.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.541
(glass crunching)

18:07.128 --> 18:08.880
You okay?

18:08.963 --> 18:10.340
Of course I'm not okay!

18:10.382 --> 18:12.217
Stay there.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.970
I'll be, I'll be right there.

18:16.054 --> 18:20.183
Anthony, we got to go.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.768
But we just got here.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.770
We got to, we got to go.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.897
ANTHONY:
This is bullshit.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.609
(tires screeching)

18:35.240 --> 18:37.492
-(tires screech)
-Wait here.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.834
(entry bell chimes)

18:45.917 --> 18:47.168
Oh, Jesus.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.754
-I am so sorr...
-Stay away from me.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.590
We can make this right.
We have insurance, uh, cash.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.384
No, nothing makes this right.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.344
Those animals can come back
any time they want.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.096
Well, they're not after you,
they're after me.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.431
Well, it sure
didn't feel that way

18:59.514 --> 19:01.016
when they were tearing
this place up.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.767
I'll take care of it.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.185
(stammers)

19:06.187 --> 19:09.107
-Holy shit.
-I said wait in the car.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.650
Mom, are you okay?

19:10.734 --> 19:12.318
I am, baby.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.904
All right, come on,
let's get out of here.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.364
Let me get my purse.

19:16.448 --> 19:17.741
Oh, it's okay, buddy.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.075
It's all right,
it's gonna be okay.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.702
I just promised my grandma

19:20.785 --> 19:22.328
I was gonna get her
to a nice place.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.413
DANNY: Yeah, well,
what are we gonna do?

19:23.455 --> 19:25.623
They came at my wife.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.209
I got to rethink
this whole gay thing now.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.669
What are you talking about?

19:29.753 --> 19:32.255
I just always assumed
they were the good guys.

19:32.297 --> 19:35.300
That's understandable,
they got terrific PR.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.803
Yo, yo.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.599
DANNY:
Hey, Marco.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.893
Viggy, the assholes are here.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.812
It's good to see you, too.

19:47.854 --> 19:48.980
You having a party?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.982
It's our anniversary.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.817
Oh. Mazel tov.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.361
Yeah, mazel tov.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.987
DANNY:
So, uh, you and Viggy

19:56.029 --> 19:58.490
have been a happy couple
for quite some time, huh?

19:58.573 --> 20:00.158
20 years.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.659
In a row?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.661
We had one bad year
when he cheated on me.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.039
Oh, that rascal. What'd you do?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.957
-What do you care?
-DANNY: Eh, you've been married

20:07.999 --> 20:09.125
longer than I have.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.585
I could learn from you.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.295
And this guy,
soon as a relationship

20:12.337 --> 20:16.341
gets complicated, "See ya."

20:16.383 --> 20:18.510
Yeah, running is easy.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.513
Are you listening?

20:21.596 --> 20:22.514
So?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.265
What could I do? I forgave him.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.892
Just like that?

20:25.975 --> 20:29.270
Well, first, I beat
the living shit out of him.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.272
And then we forgave each other.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.857
Hey. What's going on?

20:32.941 --> 20:34.526
DANNY:
Uh, Marco was just telling us

20:34.609 --> 20:36.986
how you guys kept it together
all these years.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.321
Very romantic.

20:38.363 --> 20:39.739
Yeah, fuck you.
You got my money?

20:39.823 --> 20:42.158
-Right here.
-Thank you.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.285
And to be clear,
it rains every week.

20:44.369 --> 20:47.372
Every week. We done?

20:47.455 --> 20:50.041
Almost.
I want to hear Ray say it.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.169
Every week.

20:53.211 --> 20:55.046
Good boy.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.881
You're dismissed.

21:01.845 --> 21:02.971
Give me the reason

21:03.054 --> 21:05.056
I don't kill both of them
in their sleep.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.391
'Cause I got a better idea.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.726
That's what you said
about his mother.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.937
And now I got
another better idea.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.317
(knocking on door)

21:18.737 --> 21:20.030
Hey, Lex.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.823
I'm so sorry.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.242
I just, uh,
I need a little more time.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.744
Calm down.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.620
How about we, uh,
give you an opportunity

21:27.704 --> 21:29.497
to work off your debt?

21:30.290 --> 21:32.042
The both of you?
I can do the both of you.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.419
No, not us.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.299
(door opens)

21:41.051 --> 21:43.303
(gasps)
Oh, shit.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.058
(exhales)

21:48.850 --> 21:50.727
Can we at least wait
until they dry?
