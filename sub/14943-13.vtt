WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.173
Previously on "body of proof"...

00:03.174 --> 00:05.635
I specialize in
grief counseling.

00:05.636 --> 00:07.607
Two people killed
by acts of vengeance,

00:07.608 --> 00:10.110
and the only thing those
cases have in common...

00:10.111 --> 00:11.741
Is you.

00:11.742 --> 00:15.145
Megan, you're rather
brave to come here all alone.

00:15.146 --> 00:17.187
Aren't I a diabolical killer?

00:17.188 --> 00:19.189
Well, you only kill people
you think deserve it.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.191
I want you to have this.

00:21.192 --> 00:23.253
It's my father's suicide note.

00:23.254 --> 00:25.495
I need you to run it
through the lab. Why?

00:25.496 --> 00:27.327
Because I don't believe
a word in that note.

00:27.328 --> 00:31.302
My father did not kill himself.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.540
(Door creaks)

00:40.541 --> 00:44.315
(Door closes)

01:02.433 --> 01:05.195
Daddy?

01:05.196 --> 01:07.797
I didn't want to
leave you, pumpkin.

01:07.798 --> 01:10.270
But like I said,

01:10.271 --> 01:14.144
this world is not for me.

01:14.145 --> 01:16.206
(Gunshot)

01:16.207 --> 01:18.649
(Gasps)

01:20.080 --> 01:22.081
(Exhales)

01:22.082 --> 01:23.853
(Camera shutter clicking)

01:23.854 --> 01:26.186
(Police radio chatter)

01:26.187 --> 01:29.159
Dr. Murphy, I didn't expect you.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.660
Where's Megan?

01:30.661 --> 01:32.662
That's a good question.
She's not returning any calls.

01:32.663 --> 01:34.264
Well, that's strange,

01:34.265 --> 01:35.395
especially considering

01:35.396 --> 01:37.727
she feels she's the
only m.E. In town.

01:37.728 --> 01:39.499
(Clicks)

01:39.500 --> 01:41.231
All right, so what do you see?

01:41.232 --> 01:42.332
(Chuckles)

01:42.333 --> 01:44.404
Really?

01:44.405 --> 01:45.635
Mm-hmm.

01:45.636 --> 01:47.607
(Radio chatter continues)

01:47.608 --> 01:49.679
Well, he's definitely
a-a John Doe,

01:49.680 --> 01:51.581
and somebody wanted
to keep it that way.

01:51.582 --> 01:53.413
I mean, besides the
number done on his face,

01:53.414 --> 01:56.416
both of his hands were removed
to, uh, prevent identification.

01:56.417 --> 02:00.250
Also, considering
the, uh, animal activity,

02:00.251 --> 02:03.823
he's been out here...
Two days at least.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.825
Any clue as to cause of death?

02:05.826 --> 02:09.629
Single gunshot to
the upper left chest.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.602
But there's no blood spatter.

02:12.603 --> 02:15.565
He wasn't killed here.
This was a body dump.

02:15.566 --> 02:17.837
Not bad, Dr. Gross.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.209
Thanks.

02:19.210 --> 02:20.710
(Radio chatter continues)

02:20.711 --> 02:22.242
Was this a test?

02:22.243 --> 02:23.873
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
you haven't thought about

02:23.874 --> 02:25.915
working in the field full time.

02:25.916 --> 02:27.377
(Chuckles) It doesn't suck.

02:27.378 --> 02:28.849
(Laughs)

02:30.451 --> 02:31.621
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

02:31.622 --> 02:33.323
Where are Tommy and Adam?

02:33.324 --> 02:35.485
Adam's canvassing with c.S.U.

02:35.486 --> 02:37.227
I haven't seen Tommy.

02:37.228 --> 02:41.261
Wait. Megan and
Tommy are both M.I.A.?

02:41.262 --> 02:43.162
Great.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.195
(Cell phone rings)

02:45.196 --> 02:46.366
(Clicks)

02:46.367 --> 02:48.338
(Beeps)

02:48.339 --> 02:49.270
Yeah.

02:49.271 --> 02:50.440
(Elevator bell dings)

02:50.441 --> 02:51.941
Good morning to you, too.

02:51.942 --> 02:54.304
I was at the courthouse
today. Ran into judge klein.

02:54.305 --> 02:55.505
Oh?

02:55.506 --> 02:57.907
He said your father's
exhumation was granted.

02:57.908 --> 02:59.409
This is great news. How
come you didn't tell me?

02:59.410 --> 03:02.582
I tried, the other
day at the station.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.354
Almost caught you

03:04.355 --> 03:05.485
before you left, but...

03:05.486 --> 03:07.517
Oh, you saw me
leaving with Riley,

03:07.518 --> 03:08.688
didn't you?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.220
That's why you're withholding.

03:10.221 --> 03:11.861
Look, Megan, the
ball was in your court.

03:11.862 --> 03:13.463
You took it out of play.

03:13.464 --> 03:16.195
Didn't take you long
to find another game.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.627
(Buzzes)

03:17.628 --> 03:19.329
Oh, god, it's the office.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.531
You would think I'm
the only m.E. In town.

03:21.532 --> 03:23.403
(Buzz)

03:23.404 --> 03:25.475
Listen, Tommy, this...

03:25.476 --> 03:27.977
Thing with my
father, it's fine, okay?

03:27.978 --> 03:29.679
I'm handling it.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.911
In fact, I have a 9:00 A.M.
appointment at the cemetery.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.283
I'll meet you there.

03:33.284 --> 03:34.914
I just told you,
i'm... Handling it.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.647
Right. You're not
doing this without me.

03:37.648 --> 03:39.349
(Exhales)

03:39.350 --> 03:42.353
(Machinery whirring)

03:44.655 --> 03:46.657
(Metal squeaks)

03:47.928 --> 03:50.831
(Wheels clatter, man
speaks indistinctly)

03:54.335 --> 03:56.306
You sure you want to
go through with this?

03:56.307 --> 03:59.339
Now the image you have
in your mind of your dad,

03:59.340 --> 04:01.411
you can still keep that intact.

04:01.412 --> 04:04.474
Whatever's in
there... It's not him.

04:04.475 --> 04:05.645
Megan...

04:05.646 --> 04:07.477
It's just what he left behind.

04:07.478 --> 04:09.980
I need to do this.

04:11.322 --> 04:12.422
Ma'am?

04:12.423 --> 04:13.623
Yes.

04:13.624 --> 04:14.954
(Latch clicks)

04:14.955 --> 04:16.887
(Hinges creak)

04:30.901 --> 04:34.845
♪♪♪

04:41.882 --> 04:44.414
(Hinges creak)

04:44.415 --> 04:46.756
Okay. Thank you.

04:46.757 --> 04:47.918
(Truck door closes)

04:50.421 --> 04:52.762
What did you do,
come by for a final look?

04:52.763 --> 04:54.994
No. I came to see you.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.566
To gloat?

04:56.567 --> 04:58.998
Well, you got your
exhumation order.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.472
Congratulations.

05:02.473 --> 05:04.003
(Exhales, truck door closes)

05:04.004 --> 05:07.036
Daddy's coffin was empty.

05:07.037 --> 05:09.480
(Truck engine starts)

05:11.412 --> 05:12.842
What?

05:12.843 --> 05:15.785
That is impossible.

05:15.786 --> 05:17.717
You must have
opened the wrong...

05:17.718 --> 05:21.391
I saw him. I watched
him go into the ground.

05:21.392 --> 05:23.523
Someone came
back after the funeral

05:23.524 --> 05:24.924
and removed the body.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.095
That is ridiculous.

05:26.096 --> 05:28.327
Why would anybody
want to do that?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.460
To keep somebody
from discovering the truth,

05:30.461 --> 05:32.732
that he was murdered,

05:32.733 --> 05:35.965
that his suicide was staged.

05:35.966 --> 05:37.838
(Exhales)

05:39.570 --> 05:41.541
(Voice breaking) I am...

05:41.542 --> 05:43.342
I'm sorry, mom.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.075
I know how difficult
this is for you.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.681
(Exhales)

05:52.653 --> 05:54.924
(Indistinct conversations)

05:54.925 --> 05:56.957
Sullivan.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.894
Closed door? That can't be good.

06:04.895 --> 06:07.567
Did you think I
wouldn't find out?

06:07.568 --> 06:09.569
Word's reached
me that you've been

06:09.570 --> 06:11.741
using the crime lab
for personal reasons.

06:11.742 --> 06:13.473
I just had a few people
check out the validity

06:13.474 --> 06:14.644
of a suicide note.

06:14.645 --> 06:15.805
This wasn't personal.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.106
For Megan hunt, I know.

06:17.107 --> 06:18.708
She had a feeling

06:18.709 --> 06:20.009
somebody staged
her father's suicide,

06:20.010 --> 06:21.881
that he may have been murdered.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.484
So you've been
tying up our resources

06:24.485 --> 06:29.058
on an off-book investigation
based on feelings?

06:29.059 --> 06:32.121
Even I had my doubts, but
we just exhumed her father.

06:32.122 --> 06:34.564
The coffin was empty.
Somebody stole the body.

06:34.565 --> 06:36.426
There could be
other explanations.

06:36.427 --> 06:37.597
Or he was murdered,

06:37.598 --> 06:38.768
and the killer is
covering his tracks.

06:38.769 --> 06:40.169
(Exhales deeply) Okay.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.171
If you think there's
something there,

06:42.172 --> 06:43.933
then see it through.

06:43.934 --> 06:47.878
But no more back channels, okay?

06:53.714 --> 06:55.715
(Man) So your father used
to work here at the university?

06:55.716 --> 06:56.886
He was a doctor.

06:56.887 --> 06:59.449
Uh, may of 1977, huh?

06:59.450 --> 07:01.451
Yes, the patient
files of Dr. David hunt

07:01.452 --> 07:03.092
from the campus health clinic.

07:03.093 --> 07:04.794
The university's good
at keeping records?

07:04.795 --> 07:06.025
Oh, insanely.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.557
The old head of the
department was here

07:07.558 --> 07:08.898
for, like, a hundred years.

07:08.899 --> 07:10.800
He was a total
organization Nazi.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.101
(Gate clatters)

07:12.102 --> 07:15.935
So, um, this is for a
police investigation?

07:15.936 --> 07:16.907
(Megan) Yeah.

07:16.908 --> 07:18.938
Like a... like a cold case?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.940
'Cause I devour those shows.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.773
Um, I could really be helping
you catch a killer right now.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.074
Could be.

07:25.075 --> 07:26.616
Wow.

07:26.617 --> 07:29.549
Oh, here it is. Box 5-0-9-6-5-4.

07:29.550 --> 07:33.183
Huh. It seems kinda light.

07:38.489 --> 07:39.659
(Rustles file folders)

07:39.660 --> 07:41.130
You're sure this
is the right box?

07:41.131 --> 07:42.992
1,000%. Could I see it?

07:42.993 --> 07:43.993
But where are the files?

07:43.994 --> 07:45.194
Damn it!

07:45.195 --> 07:46.566
Wait a minute.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.737
It's happening all over again.

07:47.738 --> 07:48.868
Where are you going?

07:48.869 --> 07:51.641
I'm walking. I need some air.

07:51.642 --> 07:54.043
(Kate) Unidentified male victim,

07:54.044 --> 07:55.975
possibly in his 60s.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.077
Both hands were
severed at the wrist.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.710
He suffered a gunshot
wound to the upper left chest,

08:00.711 --> 08:02.011
which was a through and through.

08:02.012 --> 08:05.254
So it's a wash on
any ballistics evidence.

08:05.255 --> 08:07.957
At least until we find the
location where he was shot.

08:07.958 --> 08:10.259
Which is almost impossible
unless we have an I.D.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.021
(Adam) And no
hands, so no prints.

08:12.022 --> 08:14.023
We can't run his face
through missing persons

08:14.024 --> 08:15.965
because he doesn't have one.

08:15.966 --> 08:17.897
I ran a sample of
his blood to d.N.A.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.799
And so far, we have zip.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.230
So if he's not in the system,

08:21.231 --> 08:23.673
we're up a you know where
without a you know what.

08:23.674 --> 08:25.504
You can say "paddle," Curtis.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.976
Boy, don't...

08:26.977 --> 08:28.538
Have you boys
forgotten my specialty?

08:28.539 --> 08:29.709
Let me take a crack at him.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.040
I may not be able
to give him hands,

08:31.041 --> 08:33.943
but I can give him a face.

08:33.944 --> 08:36.787
(Horns honk)

08:38.549 --> 08:41.721
(Indistinct conversations)

08:41.722 --> 08:42.993
Megan.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.896
Please, you have... you
have nothing to fear from me.

08:46.897 --> 08:48.127
I...

08:48.128 --> 08:49.859
(Huffs)

08:49.860 --> 08:52.031
It's very nice to
see you, Megan.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.263
(Chuckles) No, you don't.

08:54.264 --> 08:56.065
Don't... don't what?

08:56.066 --> 08:57.607
You really want me to believe

08:57.608 --> 08:59.008
we just met here by coincidence?

08:59.009 --> 09:00.139
(Chuckles) Look,
I can assure you,

09:00.140 --> 09:01.871
this is not by my design.

09:01.872 --> 09:04.013
I've thought about you, Megan.

09:04.014 --> 09:05.775
I realized that

09:05.776 --> 09:07.116
because of our past,

09:07.117 --> 09:09.078
you might not be inclined
to return to me for therapy.

09:09.079 --> 09:12.652
I do tend not to take
the advice of sociopaths.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.654
Please don't.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.125
Don't boil me down to that.

09:16.126 --> 09:18.928
It's... demeaning.

09:18.929 --> 09:20.189
Really?

09:20.190 --> 09:23.763
And I'm not just a bundle
of daddy issues to you?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.094
No.

09:25.095 --> 09:28.768
You're so much more.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.770
But you must
admit that you are...

09:30.771 --> 09:32.241
Still haunted

09:32.242 --> 09:35.705
by the death of your father.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.346
You want me to admit
something to you?

09:37.347 --> 09:40.009
I will.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.982
You got away with murder,

09:42.983 --> 09:45.154
two people, at least.

09:45.155 --> 09:48.718
And I know that you had your...

09:48.719 --> 09:50.019
Reasons.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.792
I even understand those reasons.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.765
But I don't like it.

09:56.266 --> 09:59.298
I told you things,

09:59.299 --> 10:03.072
things I've never
told anyone before.

10:03.073 --> 10:05.174
I have never betrayed
your confidence.

10:05.175 --> 10:09.909
You helped me remember
why I don't trust people.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.081
Because people disappoint.

10:12.082 --> 10:13.783
They fail you.

10:13.784 --> 10:16.746
That's your past talking, Megan.

10:16.747 --> 10:19.949
Because you felt
abandoned by your father,

10:19.950 --> 10:21.821
it's colored your every move.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.292
Maybe so.

10:23.293 --> 10:27.827
But it also taught
me to rely on myself.

10:27.828 --> 10:31.731
And as far as my
daddy issues go,

10:31.732 --> 10:36.035
I am taking care of those
the best way I know how.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.238
My way.

10:45.015 --> 10:48.647
(Paper rustles)

10:48.648 --> 10:51.781
(Chuckles)

10:51.782 --> 10:53.983
(Exhales)

10:53.984 --> 10:55.155
Mm.

10:57.988 --> 10:59.989
(Clicks)

10:59.990 --> 11:02.061
(Click)

11:02.062 --> 11:05.394
(David) Today is
April the 10th, 1970.

11:05.395 --> 11:07.737
What's your name?

11:07.738 --> 11:09.038
(Girl) You know my name, daddy.

11:09.039 --> 11:10.740
Well, tell the machine, honey.

11:10.741 --> 11:11.901
Megan hunt.

11:11.902 --> 11:13.102
And how old are you, Megan?

11:13.103 --> 11:14.744
5.

11:14.745 --> 11:16.706
Okay. I'm gonna ask you
some questions, okay?

11:16.707 --> 11:18.247
For posterity.

11:18.248 --> 11:19.949
What's that mean?

11:19.950 --> 11:22.912
Well, it means that one
day, we can listen to this

11:22.913 --> 11:25.855
when I'm old and gray.

11:25.856 --> 11:29.258
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

11:29.259 --> 11:30.790
A bird. (Laughs)

11:30.791 --> 11:31.921
What? (Laughs)

11:31.922 --> 11:34.063
You want to be a bird
when you grow up?

11:34.064 --> 11:36.325
Yep, a red one, and I'm
never gonna stop flying.

11:36.326 --> 11:38.928
I'm thirsty. I'm gonna
get some water.

11:38.929 --> 11:40.169
No, no, wait, wait, honey,

11:40.170 --> 11:42.072
don't leave.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.036
(Click)

11:47.707 --> 11:48.878
(Sniffles)

11:48.879 --> 11:50.010
(Click)

11:52.182 --> 11:55.044
(Sighs)

11:55.045 --> 11:58.287
(Rattling)

11:58.288 --> 11:59.448
(Clinks)

11:59.449 --> 12:02.252
(Clicks)

12:05.425 --> 12:07.457
(Rattles)

12:16.266 --> 12:18.437
So this was your
father's study, huh?

12:18.438 --> 12:19.909
Yeah.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.411
It's also where he...

12:22.412 --> 12:25.014
Where his body was found.

12:25.015 --> 12:27.316
So with everything
in the house gone,

12:27.317 --> 12:29.849
what could that
key possibly open?

12:29.850 --> 12:32.952
I don't know, but if he went
to all the trouble to hide it,

12:32.953 --> 12:35.124
it must have been important.

12:35.125 --> 12:38.458
This was his favorite room.

12:41.431 --> 12:44.994
You know, there's
something I wanted to ask you.

12:44.995 --> 12:46.165
What?

12:46.166 --> 12:49.298
Well, after my accident
after the plane crash,

12:49.299 --> 12:50.469
you left me a voice mail.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.971
You said...

12:51.972 --> 12:55.244
I need to know something,
then it got cut off.

12:55.245 --> 12:56.906
Really?

12:56.907 --> 13:00.549
Yeah, i... yeah, I just
played it over and over again.

13:00.550 --> 13:02.551
There was just
something in your voice.

13:02.552 --> 13:05.154
I needed to know what?

13:05.155 --> 13:07.516
Um...

13:07.517 --> 13:08.958
I don't know.

13:08.959 --> 13:11.821
Uh, you were missing.

13:11.822 --> 13:14.023
I thought something
had happened to you.

13:14.024 --> 13:16.095
We were all worried.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.297
Oh, was that it?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.429
Yes.

13:20.430 --> 13:22.201
Because...

13:22.202 --> 13:24.974
You know,

13:24.975 --> 13:27.007
if something ever
happened to you...

13:35.415 --> 13:36.585
Tommy.

13:36.586 --> 13:37.988
Yeah?

13:42.923 --> 13:45.055
Look.

13:48.398 --> 13:49.558
Wow.

13:49.559 --> 13:51.461
Never knew that was there.

14:05.115 --> 14:08.518
It's one of the
missing medical files.

14:11.081 --> 14:13.052
Who is she?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.454
Why'd your dad go to such
great lengths to hide this?

14:15.455 --> 14:18.057
I don't know,

14:18.058 --> 14:21.091
but I bet it got him killed.

14:29.399 --> 14:32.402
(Indistinct conversations)

14:34.905 --> 14:36.505
(Exhales)

14:36.506 --> 14:39.108
I've gone over this
file at least ten times,

14:39.109 --> 14:40.609
and I still don't know

14:40.610 --> 14:42.611
why my father kept
it under lock and key.

14:42.612 --> 14:44.113
But he was definitely
Lindsay Pratt's doctor

14:44.114 --> 14:45.314
at the university.

14:45.315 --> 14:47.456
It's pretty obvious
she was assaulted.

14:47.457 --> 14:48.587
Were you able to locate her?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.189
I really want to ask
her what happened.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.321
That's not gonna be possible,
'cause Lindsay Pratt is dead.

14:52.322 --> 14:53.662
What?

14:53.663 --> 14:55.324
Murdered, 1977...

14:55.325 --> 14:57.626
She was killed the day
before your father died.

14:57.627 --> 14:59.168
It's a good thing
you're sitting down.

14:59.169 --> 15:00.399
You're not gonna
believe who killed her.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.231
Earl brown.

15:02.232 --> 15:04.233
Earl brown?

15:04.234 --> 15:06.135
Why do I know that
name... Earl brown?

15:06.136 --> 15:08.137
Earl brown, serial
killer, remember?

15:08.138 --> 15:10.379
Killed four other
girls the same year.

15:10.380 --> 15:13.242
And Lindsay and my father
died within a day of each other?

15:13.243 --> 15:15.514
There's no way
that's not related.

15:15.515 --> 15:19.048
Please don't tell me
Earl brown's dead, too.

15:19.049 --> 15:21.650
(Tommy) Very much
alive. Convicted in 1978.

15:21.651 --> 15:24.954
He's serving three
consecutive life terms.

15:24.955 --> 15:28.097
Mr. Brown.

15:28.098 --> 15:29.398
Mr. Brown, we were
hoping we could get

15:29.399 --> 15:30.699
a few minutes of your time.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.231
(Door clanks)

15:32.232 --> 15:34.233
To whom am I speaking?

15:34.234 --> 15:36.235
I'm detective Tommy
Sullivan from Philly p.D.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.467
This is my associate,
Dr. Megan hunt

15:38.468 --> 15:40.310
from the medical
examiner's office.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.214
Thank you.

15:45.215 --> 15:48.047
The warden tells us you
don't speak very much.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.249
A testament to the quality

15:50.250 --> 15:53.552
of the company
I'm forced to keep.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.454
We were wondering if
you could shed some light

15:55.455 --> 15:56.986
on one of your victims.

15:56.987 --> 15:59.658
I see.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.161
We realize it... it was
a long time ago, but...

16:02.162 --> 16:05.164
I have spent half my life

16:05.165 --> 16:09.498
in prison... Ms. Hunt.

16:09.499 --> 16:12.171
Memories are all I have

16:12.172 --> 16:14.143
and all I need.

16:14.144 --> 16:17.546
(Doors clanking)

16:17.547 --> 16:23.752
I remember every little detail.

16:23.753 --> 16:26.356
Who would you
like to hear about?

16:28.188 --> 16:31.020
Teresa?

16:31.021 --> 16:33.192
Candace?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.264
Mary?

16:35.265 --> 16:38.597
Donna?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.299
(Sighs deeply)

16:40.300 --> 16:43.702
Now Donna...

16:43.703 --> 16:47.005
She was my favorite.

16:47.006 --> 16:51.540
She had the sweetest
little blonde curls

16:51.541 --> 16:53.582
on the nape of her neck...

16:53.583 --> 16:55.285
Tell me about Lindsay Pratt.

16:58.388 --> 17:02.221
I never had the pleasure
of meeting Ms. Pratt.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.224
That doesn't seem possible,
seeing you murdered her.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.397
(Sighs)

17:09.159 --> 17:12.331
I did not end that
girl's life, detective.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.163
And it upsets me

17:14.164 --> 17:17.307
that the legal record
states otherwise.

17:19.609 --> 17:22.211
So I'm just supposed
to believe you?

17:22.212 --> 17:25.144
(Chuckles) Well...

17:25.145 --> 17:29.118
Look around you, detective.

17:29.119 --> 17:32.121
I'm not going anywhere for...

17:32.122 --> 17:35.524
Three lifetimes at least.

17:35.525 --> 17:39.688
Ask yourself...

17:39.689 --> 17:42.191
Why would I lie?

17:42.192 --> 17:44.563
(Door clanks)

17:44.564 --> 17:46.695
(Keys jangle)

17:46.696 --> 17:48.498
(Chuckles)

17:51.141 --> 17:53.173
(Exhales)

17:55.705 --> 17:57.376
Nice shot.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.648
Ah. (Chuckles) Oh, thank you.

17:59.649 --> 18:01.210
You're too kind.

18:01.211 --> 18:02.551
Dr. Hunt, I'm guessing.

18:02.552 --> 18:04.413
My office said
you'd be coming by.

18:04.414 --> 18:05.754
Mr. Fitz.

18:05.755 --> 18:08.387
Detective, don't recognize
you from the trenches.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.619
Tommy Sullivan,
recent transplant.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.291
Retired myself, ten years ago.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.164
We're here to ask you
about the Earl brown murders,

18:15.165 --> 18:17.126
since you were the lead
detective on that case.

18:17.127 --> 18:18.867
Hmm.

18:18.868 --> 18:21.300
Well, that's been a while.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.373
And it's well documented.

18:24.374 --> 18:26.205
What could I
possibly tell you that

18:26.206 --> 18:30.209
case files and court
records haven't spelled out

18:30.210 --> 18:32.381
in detail?

18:32.382 --> 18:34.383
Well, the fact that Earl brown

18:34.384 --> 18:38.317
didn't actually kill
Lindsay Pratt for one.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.118
After all this time,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.651
why would you suddenly
believe something like that?

18:42.652 --> 18:44.153
Uh, we're just looking

18:44.154 --> 18:46.425
into a possible
murder case from 1977.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.427
We think it has something
to do with Ms. Pratt's death.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.259
And Earl brown claims

18:50.260 --> 18:53.202
that he never met Lindsay Pratt.

18:53.203 --> 18:54.164
(Sighs)

18:54.165 --> 18:57.166
Ms. Pratt was a co-ed

18:57.167 --> 19:00.339
with a similar victim
profile to all the others.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.242
Method of death... asphyxiation.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.544
Not to mention that
each of the victims

19:05.545 --> 19:08.247
had a postage stamp
affixed to their tongue.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.250
A 13-cent stamp, by the way,

19:11.251 --> 19:13.282
because he said

19:13.283 --> 19:16.154
that it was his duty
to send the girls on

19:16.155 --> 19:19.188
to their next destination.

19:19.189 --> 19:21.530
The jury came back
with a guilty verdict

19:21.531 --> 19:24.663
without a moment
of deliberation.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.236
So...

19:27.237 --> 19:29.338
If you're pursuing this lead

19:29.339 --> 19:33.702
on the word of a
convicted serial killer,

19:33.703 --> 19:36.375
I'd say you're on
a fool's errand.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.347
Whereas myself,

19:38.348 --> 19:40.709
I have more
therapeutic endeavors

19:40.710 --> 19:43.413
in my immediate future.

19:44.714 --> 19:46.655
Good day.

19:46.656 --> 19:48.287
Thanks so much.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.558
(Club strikes ball)

19:49.559 --> 19:50.719
(Elevator bell dings)

19:50.720 --> 19:52.861
(People speaking indistinctly)

19:52.862 --> 19:54.363
There you are. We
were getting worried.

19:54.364 --> 19:55.694
You weren't
answering your phone.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.195
And here comes the big speech.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.467
You know what?

19:58.468 --> 20:00.499
I cannot be at your Beck
and call 24 hours a day.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.331
That is asking way
too much of me.

20:02.332 --> 20:03.832
That is not what I was gonna...
And I know I should've called,

20:03.833 --> 20:05.504
but this thing with
my father has...

20:05.505 --> 20:07.506
Yes, you've been looking into
his death, I know. Yes, I have,

20:07.507 --> 20:08.837
and please don't tell me
it's a conflict of interest

20:08.838 --> 20:10.208
or it's way too
emotional for me,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.610
because you would be
correct on both counts.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.982
And you know what?
I don't give a damn.

20:13.983 --> 20:15.344
And if you have a
problem with that...

20:15.345 --> 20:16.485
(Drops file) I quit.

20:16.486 --> 20:19.248
Wh-whoa. Me... Will
you just let me talk?

20:19.249 --> 20:20.219
You're not quitting, all right?

20:20.220 --> 20:21.390
I was just gonna say,

20:21.391 --> 20:23.221
I know how important
this is to you.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.954
I would want answers, too.

20:25.955 --> 20:27.326
Oh.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.328
So take as much
time as you need.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.629
And if anybody has
a problem with that,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.261
you tell them they
can come see me.

20:32.262 --> 20:35.304
Okay. I will.

20:35.305 --> 20:36.605
Thank you.

20:36.606 --> 20:37.767
Sorry.

20:43.313 --> 20:45.314
(Tommy) Hey.

20:45.315 --> 20:47.516
Are those the autopsy reports?

20:47.517 --> 20:49.978
Yeah, from all five of
Earl brown's victims.

20:49.979 --> 20:52.020
All five of them died
from asphyxiation.

20:52.021 --> 20:53.522
And all five of them were found

20:53.523 --> 20:55.484
with a postage
stamp on their tongue,

20:55.485 --> 20:57.956
but here's the thing...

20:57.957 --> 20:59.828
The first four women died

20:59.829 --> 21:03.261
from a combination of
smothering and torso compression.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.734
Burking. Sat on their chest
and suffocated them. Right.

21:05.735 --> 21:07.466
But Lindsay Pratt
was asphyxiated

21:07.467 --> 21:09.468
in an entirely different way.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.300
Her jugular veins
and carotid arteries

21:11.301 --> 21:13.472
were compressed on
both sides of her neck...

21:13.473 --> 21:16.445
A lateral vascular
neck restraint.

21:16.446 --> 21:18.577
Sounds like an old
police choke hold. Exactly.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.909
Okay, and brown's m.O.
With the postage stamp...

21:20.910 --> 21:23.982
None of this information
was ever leaked to the press.

21:23.983 --> 21:27.055
So... what if

21:27.056 --> 21:30.919
a police officer
kills Lindsay Pratt,

21:30.920 --> 21:35.063
sticks a 13-cent postage
stamp on her tongue

21:35.064 --> 21:37.626
to look like Earl brown did it?

21:37.627 --> 21:39.468
(Exhales) Maybe your father
was the only one who knew,

21:39.469 --> 21:41.299
that's what got him killed.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.732
It's no wonder Glen Fitz
wasn't very forthcoming.

21:43.733 --> 21:46.405
He was the lead detective on
this case. He knew everything.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.379
Or he was the killer.

21:57.086 --> 21:58.347
(Tommy) Oh,
chief, there you are.

21:58.348 --> 21:59.648
I've been looking
all over for you.

21:59.649 --> 22:00.819
You got a minute?

22:00.820 --> 22:01.990
Not unless you're
here to tell me

22:01.991 --> 22:03.352
that you're dropping
this business

22:03.353 --> 22:04.393
with Megan hunt's father

22:04.394 --> 22:05.494
and you're ready
to get back to work.

22:05.495 --> 22:07.526
Exact opposite, actually.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.398
Okay.

22:09.399 --> 22:10.859
Go on.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.861
We were looking into David
hunt's medical practice.

22:12.862 --> 22:16.365
We found an old patient
file, been hidden all this time.

22:16.366 --> 22:18.036
He had treated a young woman

22:18.037 --> 22:20.969
who was later thought to have
been murdered by Earl brown.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.471
The serial killer?

22:22.472 --> 22:24.112
Except Earl brown
says he didn't kill her.

22:24.113 --> 22:25.614
The medical examiner's
report comes back

22:25.615 --> 22:27.476
and said that she was
killed in a different manner

22:27.477 --> 22:28.817
than all his other victims.

22:28.818 --> 22:30.348
Different manner how?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.480
They were suffocated.

22:31.481 --> 22:34.453
She was killed with
a police choke hold.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.884
Wait a minute.

22:35.885 --> 22:37.556
Are you trying to
say that you think

22:37.557 --> 22:40.128
a cop killed that girl in 1977

22:40.129 --> 22:42.391
and blamed it on brown?

22:42.392 --> 22:43.692
And I also think David
hunt knew something,

22:43.693 --> 22:45.133
and that's what got him killed.

22:45.134 --> 22:46.635
Who was the lead detective?

22:46.636 --> 22:48.136
Glen Fitz.

22:48.137 --> 22:49.638
I just want to
question him officially,

22:49.639 --> 22:51.369
but I need your okay.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.771
On one condition...

22:52.772 --> 22:54.503
You tread very carefully.

22:54.504 --> 22:56.405
I don't want word of
possible corruption

22:56.406 --> 22:58.146
leaking beyond these walls.

22:58.147 --> 23:00.049
You got it.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.719
Look at you go.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.060
(Chuckles)

23:12.061 --> 23:13.522
And that smile.

23:13.523 --> 23:16.164
We don't get to see
that often enough.

23:16.165 --> 23:17.896
You dig this, don't you?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.898
Well, yeah. This is
what got me excited

23:19.899 --> 23:22.170
about doing this kind
of work in the first place.

23:22.171 --> 23:25.173
It makes me wonder why
i'm so anxious to give it all up.

23:25.174 --> 23:26.875
What, to be a congresswoman?

23:26.876 --> 23:28.036
Mm-hmm.

23:28.037 --> 23:29.538
Oh, you can't help that.

23:29.539 --> 23:31.039
It's the American way.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.512
Everybody's always
thinking about what's next.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.884
What about you? You
subscribe to that theory?

23:35.885 --> 23:37.145
Mnh-mnh.

23:37.146 --> 23:38.517
I'll be right here

23:38.518 --> 23:39.848
until I crawl into a
morgue drawer myself

23:39.849 --> 23:41.890
and wake up in
heaven. (Chuckles)

23:41.891 --> 23:43.121
Really?

23:43.122 --> 23:45.093
It's all I ever wanted to do,

23:45.094 --> 23:46.595
and I'm doing it.

23:46.596 --> 23:48.156
Even when y'all drive me crazy,

23:48.157 --> 23:51.660
I'm loving every minute of it.

23:51.661 --> 23:53.762
And if you tell
anybody I said that,

23:53.763 --> 23:55.664
I'll sprinkle hemlock
in your tea. Oh.

23:55.665 --> 23:57.005
Don't think I won't.

23:57.006 --> 23:58.206
(Laughs)

23:58.207 --> 24:00.870
You're in good hands, Mr. Doe.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.476
(Tommy) Okay,
here's the thing...

24:07.477 --> 24:08.977
I know you want a
crack at him, Megan,

24:08.978 --> 24:11.149
but you're gonna have to
let me fly solo on this one.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.521
What?

24:12.522 --> 24:13.982
This guy may have
killed my father.

24:13.983 --> 24:15.453
May have.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.756
Now I know how
to talk to these guys.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.027
Do you want to nail him?

24:19.028 --> 24:20.228
(Scoffs)

24:20.229 --> 24:21.760
Trust me.

24:21.761 --> 24:25.163
(Exhales) How
you doing, Mr. Fitz?

24:25.164 --> 24:27.135
I know your time is
valuable. (Closes door)

24:27.136 --> 24:29.638
I just wanted to continue
our discussion in light

24:29.639 --> 24:30.799
of some new information...

24:30.800 --> 24:32.641
Just say your piece. Okay.

24:32.642 --> 24:34.843
Dr. Hunt reviewed
the autopsy reports

24:34.844 --> 24:36.474
of each one of brown's victims.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.247
You said there was only one
cause of death for each case.

24:39.248 --> 24:40.579
Asphyxiation.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.651
Well, she found
two modes of death.

24:42.652 --> 24:44.152
Four of 'em died from burking.

24:44.153 --> 24:46.615
Lindsay died from an
outdated police choke hold.

24:46.616 --> 24:47.956
Close enough.

24:47.957 --> 24:49.257
Yeah, you see that's
what I find hard to believe.

24:49.258 --> 24:52.190
Somebody with your
knowledge, your experience...

24:52.191 --> 24:53.962
Why would you blanket
two modes of death

24:53.963 --> 24:55.193
under the same signature?

24:55.194 --> 24:58.997
Earl brown is
guilty, believe me.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.529
You ever heard of
the name David hunt?

25:00.530 --> 25:02.230
No. He was a doctor

25:02.231 --> 25:03.202
who treated Lindsay
for some injuries

25:03.203 --> 25:04.733
after she got beat up.

25:04.734 --> 25:06.074
See, I'm thinking she was afraid

25:06.075 --> 25:08.276
to report her assailant
to the police because

25:08.277 --> 25:10.839
it was actually a cop.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.210
By the end of the week,

25:12.211 --> 25:14.543
both of 'em are dead.

25:14.544 --> 25:17.716
Well, that's a pretty wild
theory you've concocted there.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.248
And just how do I factor in?

25:20.249 --> 25:22.691
Well, you're the closest
one to the investigation.

25:22.692 --> 25:26.755
See, you had Earl brown
on four counts of homicide.

25:26.756 --> 25:29.157
So why throw the
other murder in there?

25:29.158 --> 25:32.601
I see where this is going
and I don't like it one bit.

25:32.602 --> 25:34.763
Let me tell you something.

25:34.764 --> 25:36.534
I was a great cop,

25:36.535 --> 25:38.066
twice the cop you're
ever gonna be.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.207
Decades of protecting this city,

25:39.208 --> 25:41.039
and this is the thanks I get?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.071
You feel the need
to get in touch

25:43.072 --> 25:45.043
with me again, you
do it through my lawyer.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.875
No, no, no. No, no, no.

25:46.876 --> 25:48.617
You are not... (Slams door)

25:48.618 --> 25:49.918
Squirming out of it this time.

25:49.919 --> 25:51.249
So what, Lindsay
was your girlfriend?

25:51.250 --> 25:52.781
She threatened
to tell your wife,

25:52.782 --> 25:54.883
and you punched her,
a little jab in the ribs,

25:54.884 --> 25:56.554
and then you what,
had to finish her off?

25:56.555 --> 25:57.726
You know, I don't know

25:57.727 --> 25:59.057
who the hell you
think you are, lady,

25:59.058 --> 26:00.328
but you better shut up.

26:00.329 --> 26:01.760
Oh, yeah, or what?

26:01.761 --> 26:04.633
You gonna shut me up,
just like you did Lindsay,

26:04.634 --> 26:06.735
and like you did my father?

26:06.736 --> 26:08.266
Okay, Megan, let's go.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.270
You are gonna
pay for what you did.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.143
I told you to let
me handle this.

26:15.144 --> 26:17.175
He killed my father!
I know it was him!

26:17.176 --> 26:19.247
We... we don't know that, Megan,
and now by you busting in there,

26:19.248 --> 26:20.979
you basically just laid
out our whole theory.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.081
Now he knows exactly what
we're thinking, how to counteract.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.313
You were too soft on him.

26:25.314 --> 26:26.815
Megan, it's just an
interrogation tactic.

26:26.816 --> 26:28.657
Ohh!

26:28.658 --> 26:30.689
So what? So what, that is it?

26:30.690 --> 26:32.661
No, it's not it! I got a call
in to his former partner.

26:32.662 --> 26:33.992
I'll start with him.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.363
I'll talk with him. I'll
see what he knows.

26:35.364 --> 26:37.796
This is the guy! We had him!

26:37.797 --> 26:40.168
Megan, we need evidence
or he's gonna walk.

26:40.169 --> 26:42.330
(Exhales)

26:42.331 --> 26:44.332
No, no, he won't.

26:44.333 --> 26:45.734
Where are you going?

26:45.735 --> 26:47.276
(Door opens) Megan.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.717
You got me.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.348
This time it's no coincidence.

27:00.349 --> 27:03.351
Wow.

27:03.352 --> 27:05.223
Cornering me in
the police station.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.225
That is bold,

27:07.226 --> 27:09.157
even for you.

27:09.158 --> 27:11.229
Well, I've got nothing to hide.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.061
What do you want?

27:13.062 --> 27:15.303
To talk.

27:15.304 --> 27:17.866
I was bothered by
something you said yesterday.

27:17.867 --> 27:19.868
You said you were
going to deal with things

27:19.869 --> 27:21.710
in your own way.

27:21.711 --> 27:23.371
And I got to thinking

27:23.372 --> 27:25.343
so I did a little homework.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.875
You no longer believe

27:26.876 --> 27:28.778
you father committed
suicide, do you?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.381
You believe he was murdered.

27:34.383 --> 27:37.086
Do you have any idea who
the killer may have been?

27:40.359 --> 27:42.230
But justice...

27:42.231 --> 27:45.734
Has proven elusive, hasn't it?

27:45.735 --> 27:47.065
Even for you.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.997
For now.

27:48.998 --> 27:52.842
I know what you believe.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.074
If you could just
find the person

27:56.075 --> 27:58.246
who took your father from you,

27:58.247 --> 28:00.348
then that deep
fissure in your heart

28:00.349 --> 28:03.952
will somehow be mended.

28:03.953 --> 28:05.253
But I can assure you,

28:05.254 --> 28:07.385
even if that moment comes,

28:07.386 --> 28:10.318
the fissure will remain.

28:10.319 --> 28:12.290
Because what punishment

28:12.291 --> 28:15.293
can possibly be fitting enough

28:15.294 --> 28:19.267
for the one who
inexcusably robbed you...

28:19.268 --> 28:21.230
Of what was so dear?

28:22.732 --> 28:26.434
There's only one
just punishment,

28:26.435 --> 28:28.907
only one...

28:28.908 --> 28:32.141
Possible outcome suitable...

28:33.382 --> 28:35.944
For a taker of lives.

28:35.945 --> 28:39.347
It's not gonna bring
my father back.

28:39.348 --> 28:41.490
Did it bring your wife back?

28:43.322 --> 28:45.353
Did it mend the fissure...

28:45.354 --> 28:47.295
(Chuckles)

28:47.296 --> 28:49.297
Deep in your heart?

28:49.298 --> 28:51.230
It most certainly did.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.807
I'd like to help you, Megan.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.310
Let me help you.

29:05.274 --> 29:07.046
(Huffs)

29:10.179 --> 29:13.481
No.

29:13.482 --> 29:15.223
(Opens car door)

29:15.224 --> 29:18.287
I need to do this my
way, the legal way.

29:20.529 --> 29:24.362
You do understand me?

29:24.363 --> 29:26.095
(Huffs)

29:30.069 --> 29:32.071
Very well, then.

31:41.130 --> 31:44.133
Talk to me, daddy. Talk to me.

31:49.608 --> 31:52.581

Who's this guy?

32:20.269 --> 32:21.569
Oh, it's for the
case I'm working.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.271
A John Doe found in the park.

32:23.272 --> 32:24.942
I reconstructed his face.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.115
I'm hoping it'll help us get an
I.D. What happened to him?

32:27.116 --> 32:29.147
He was shot in the chest
and both hands severed,

32:29.148 --> 32:31.179
about three days ago, why?

32:31.180 --> 32:32.350
(Rustles papers)

32:32.351 --> 32:33.481
Ah.

32:33.482 --> 32:35.183
Look at that photo,
the guy on the left.

32:35.184 --> 32:36.524
One of the homicide detectives.

32:36.525 --> 32:40.658
That photo was taken in 1977.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.262
Now look at your drawing.

32:47.036 --> 32:49.437
Whoa. Look at
the similarities...

32:49.438 --> 32:51.569
That heavy eyebrow
Ridge, the... the cheekbones,

32:51.570 --> 32:53.071
the diastema.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.442
That is the same guy

32:54.443 --> 32:56.245
35 years later.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.447
It has to be... (Rustles papers)

32:59.448 --> 33:01.509
Glen Fitz's

33:01.510 --> 33:04.152
former partner...

33:04.153 --> 33:06.384
Wilcox.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.086
Arthur wilcox.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.418
Wilcox. All right, so what...
What does that mean?

33:10.419 --> 33:12.260
What does it mean? It means...

33:12.261 --> 33:13.722
It means everything.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.426
(Elevator bell dings)

33:18.427 --> 33:22.301
(Indistinct conversations)

33:24.633 --> 33:27.205
Oh, damn it.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.737
Has anyone seen Tommy Sullivan?

33:29.738 --> 33:32.110
Chief Martin.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.511
Dr. Hunt.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.384
I know that Tommy apprised
you of the Glen Fitz situation.

33:36.385 --> 33:39.087
I can now prove
that he was involved.

33:39.088 --> 33:41.089
Three days ago, there
was a new murder,

33:41.090 --> 33:42.650
all part of the cover-up.

33:42.651 --> 33:45.093
Okay, I'm all ears.

33:45.094 --> 33:48.056
(Sighs) Well, it's all
back at my office, but...

33:48.057 --> 33:49.427
Would you mind?

33:49.428 --> 33:53.161
I-I just... i would really
like to move on this.

33:53.162 --> 33:54.363
All right.

33:56.705 --> 33:59.437
Do you know the
name Arthur wilcox?

33:59.438 --> 34:01.439
Of course. He's been
around since I was a rookie.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.271
Retired a few years ago.

34:03.272 --> 34:06.474
He was Glen Fitz's
partner in the late '70s.

34:06.475 --> 34:08.476
He was just shot to death.

34:08.477 --> 34:11.149
What? He was?

34:11.150 --> 34:13.221
Probably because
he kept a secret

34:13.222 --> 34:15.083
for the last 35 years...

34:15.084 --> 34:17.685
That Fitz not only
killed a young girl,

34:17.686 --> 34:20.158
but also my father.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.630
That's quite a claim.

34:22.631 --> 34:26.764
And you've got hard evidence
linking Fitz to the murders?

34:26.765 --> 34:29.567
Not yet, but I will.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.370
I promise.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.402
Gotta hand it to you, Dr. Hunt.

34:34.403 --> 34:37.305
You just don't give up.

34:37.306 --> 34:38.606
(Thunderclap)

34:38.607 --> 34:40.248
Unfortunately,

34:40.249 --> 34:42.811
that's also gonna
get you killed.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.395
What are we doing?

34:57.396 --> 34:59.267
Why'd you make me come here?

34:59.268 --> 35:00.598
I've kept my eye
on your progress

35:00.599 --> 35:03.601
ever since you had your
father's suicide note examined.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.274
I just never thought
you'd get this far.

35:06.275 --> 35:07.605
I still don't understand.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.637
What do you have
to do with my father?

35:09.638 --> 35:11.108
You don't need to know.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.612
No, I deserve to know.

35:15.244 --> 35:18.115
I was a rookie patrol officer,

35:18.116 --> 35:20.588
had this boyfriend I worshipped.

35:20.589 --> 35:21.719
Except he left me.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.891
For Lindsay Pratt.

35:23.892 --> 35:25.553
One night, I attacked her,

35:25.554 --> 35:26.694
told her to stay away from him,

35:26.695 --> 35:28.526
but she wouldn't do it, so...

35:28.527 --> 35:31.459
I paid her another visit.

35:31.460 --> 35:33.431
The situation got out of hand.

35:33.432 --> 35:35.663
Yeah. You strangled her.

35:35.664 --> 35:38.406
And I called Arthur
wilcox. I told him everything.

35:38.407 --> 35:39.737
He was...

35:39.738 --> 35:42.910
(Exhales) He was
a friend of the family.

35:42.911 --> 35:44.612
Instead of arresting me,

35:44.613 --> 35:46.614
he told me how this
could all go away.

35:46.615 --> 35:47.815
Right.

35:47.816 --> 35:50.648
Stick a 13-cent
stamp on her tongue,

35:50.649 --> 35:53.321
make it look like the
work of a serial killer.

35:53.322 --> 35:55.583
I just had to get rid
of the loose ends.

35:55.584 --> 35:56.924
That's when I found out

35:56.925 --> 35:59.187
she went to your
father for treatment.

35:59.188 --> 36:02.360
I was afraid she told
him who attacked her.

36:02.361 --> 36:07.235
You forced him... To
write his own suicide note.

36:07.236 --> 36:09.737
You shot him...

36:09.738 --> 36:13.301
And then you dug him
up out of the ground,

36:13.302 --> 36:15.473
like an animal.

36:15.474 --> 36:18.175
All I ever wanted
to be was a cop.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.507
The thought of losing that...

36:19.508 --> 36:21.449
What about losing a daughter

36:21.450 --> 36:23.251
like Lindsay's parents,

36:23.252 --> 36:24.652
a father?

36:24.653 --> 36:27.785
You destroyed my family!

36:27.786 --> 36:29.817
And I've spent the last 35 years

36:29.818 --> 36:32.490
trying to atone for that.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.791
Screw you!

36:33.792 --> 36:35.663
You can justify
this all you want.

36:35.664 --> 36:37.625
You're nothing but
a cold-blooded killer.

36:37.626 --> 36:38.796
If it wasn't for you,

36:38.797 --> 36:40.728
I wouldn't have had
to kill wilcox and Fitz.

36:40.729 --> 36:42.600
If you didn't have
this compulsion

36:42.601 --> 36:45.673
to keep digging up the past...

36:45.674 --> 36:47.605
You killed Fitz?

36:47.606 --> 36:49.407
He never suspected
anything back then,

36:49.408 --> 36:51.679
until you questioned him.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.811
Then he called me, said
something wasn't right.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.384
I've come too far
to go back now.

36:56.385 --> 36:59.517
You are my last loose end.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.489
Megan hunt...

37:01.490 --> 37:03.321
Just couldn't get over

37:03.322 --> 37:04.722
her father's death,

37:04.723 --> 37:07.755
so she's decided
to repeat history.

37:07.756 --> 37:09.757
(Crying) Please.

37:09.758 --> 37:11.599
Don't do this.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.631
I have a daughter.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.333
For an intelligent woman,

37:15.334 --> 37:16.864
you still don't seem
to get it, do you?

37:16.865 --> 37:18.235
I have to.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.509
(Gunshot) Aah!

37:21.510 --> 37:22.710
(Thuds)

37:22.711 --> 37:26.013
(Thunder rumbling)

37:26.014 --> 37:28.716
(Rainfall)

37:28.717 --> 37:29.948
(Exhales)

37:40.389 --> 37:42.591
(Exhales)

37:49.037 --> 37:51.470
Thank you.

38:01.450 --> 38:04.752
(Sirens wailing)

38:04.753 --> 38:08.456
(Police radio chatter)

38:08.457 --> 38:12.620
(Indistinct conversations)

38:12.621 --> 38:14.291
(Tommy) Megan.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.695
God, I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.527
Who was it?

38:19.528 --> 38:21.969
Do you know who saved your life?

38:21.970 --> 38:25.974
(Police radio chatter)

38:28.306 --> 38:30.679
Philly p.D.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.475
(Door opens)

39:07.476 --> 39:09.548
(Tommy) All right.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.082
Nah, he's long gone.

39:20.489 --> 39:22.360
(Lock clicks)

39:43.682 --> 39:45.683
(Crying)

39:45.684 --> 39:48.956
Oh, Megan. (Sniffles)

39:48.957 --> 39:50.789
Ohh.

39:52.521 --> 39:55.494
(Knock on door)

40:02.000 --> 40:04.131
Hey.

40:04.132 --> 40:05.973
Sorry. I know it's late.

40:05.974 --> 40:07.936
Not at all. Come on in.

40:10.739 --> 40:12.811
(Sighs)

40:15.614 --> 40:17.815
Um, thank you...

40:17.816 --> 40:20.448
For... (Huffs) Everything.

40:20.449 --> 40:22.651
I couldn't have
done it without you.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.523
How do you feel?

40:25.524 --> 40:28.025
(Exhales deeply)

40:28.026 --> 40:32.600
I... can't even begin
to answer that question.

40:32.601 --> 40:35.433
I don't know that I ever will.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.867
(Exhales)

40:39.868 --> 40:42.970
I do know one thing, though.

40:42.971 --> 40:44.972
I've spent most of my life

40:44.973 --> 40:48.015
allowing my past
to rule my present,

40:48.016 --> 40:50.718
a-and everything
with my father, y-yeah,

40:50.719 --> 40:53.821
but... also with you, too.

40:53.822 --> 40:55.823
And I've held the
past against you

40:55.824 --> 40:56.924
for way too long, Tommy.

40:56.925 --> 40:58.185
It's just not fair.

40:58.186 --> 40:59.857
(Inhales)

40:59.858 --> 41:01.188
(Voice breaking)
You're not the man

41:01.189 --> 41:02.790
that you were 20 years ago,

41:02.791 --> 41:04.091
and ever since you've been here,

41:04.092 --> 41:07.165
you've been showing me
that over and over again.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.569
(Chuckling) I don't even
know why you put up with me.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.601
I don't.

41:13.602 --> 41:14.772
Megan.

41:14.773 --> 41:15.744
(Sighs) Yeah?

41:15.745 --> 41:17.506
You're worth it.
