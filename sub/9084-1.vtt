WEBVTT

00:00.277 --> 00:01.529
That it can't be done.

00:01.611 --> 00:03.864
When they believe in you like that.

00:03.947 --> 00:05.073
We didn't want to disappoint him.

00:05.157 --> 00:06.374
No. We got busy.

00:06.449 --> 00:08.292
Not that we thought
that we could do it.

00:08.368 --> 00:09.915
At least Timothy
would know that we tried.

00:09.995 --> 00:11.247
<i>Yeah. We stayed up
all that first night.</i>

00:11.288 --> 00:13.336
<i>We stayed up
several nights after that.</i>

00:13.415 --> 00:14.541
<i>Cindy started making sketches.</i>

00:14.624 --> 00:15.876
<i>Jim started carving.</i>

00:16.585 --> 00:19.759
<i>It turns out we weren't
the only ones making something.</i>

00:20.714 --> 00:23.934
<i>Yeah. We both came up
with the idea to use leaves.</i>

00:24.009 --> 00:25.010
<i>Leaves.</i>

00:28.263 --> 00:31.358
See? Now just wind it.
The other way. Yeah. You got it.

00:35.395 --> 00:37.113
Just a little more.

00:37.355 --> 00:39.323
Yeah, see?
Just put it right through.

00:39.399 --> 00:41.276
- Like this?
- That's good.

00:43.195 --> 00:45.072
So we've got
our leaf slurry pretty much ready.

00:45.197 --> 00:47.416
Okay. Right on in.

00:49.451 --> 00:50.953
- Perfect.
- That should do it.

00:51.203 --> 00:53.956
Let's see. Help it... Help it push it down.

00:54.206 --> 00:56.379
Okay.

00:56.458 --> 00:57.880
Oh, yeah!

01:01.755 --> 01:02.802
Okay.

01:03.548 --> 01:05.425
Ta-da!

01:05.507 --> 01:08.762
Oh, my gosh!
This is the pencil. You really did it.

01:08.845 --> 01:10.222
- We did.
- You made it.

01:10.305 --> 01:13.730
So we're to believe
that you made a pencil out of leaves?

01:14.142 --> 01:16.270
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, it was a prototype.

01:16.353 --> 01:19.277
You do realize if any part of
your story doesn't check out,

01:19.356 --> 01:20.778
we are done here.

01:20.857 --> 01:23.406
And we will be
checking it out. Thoroughly.

01:23.485 --> 01:24.611
- And you should.
- Well, good.

01:24.694 --> 01:28.915
Anyway, that Monday
was take your kid to work day.

01:29.658 --> 01:30.659
He started with me.

01:31.451 --> 01:34.204
<i>It was kind of
a celebratory day at work and...</i>

01:36.915 --> 01:38.462
<i>Timothy wanted to be in on it.</i>

01:38.541 --> 01:40.009
Something's missing.

01:40.126 --> 01:42.629
Oh, nonsense. It's you. So...

01:43.171 --> 01:44.343
Very you.

01:44.673 --> 01:45.970
Gentlemen.

01:48.051 --> 01:50.145
<i>And as soon
as he met my boss,</i>

01:50.262 --> 01:52.230
<i>he didn't know to be intimidated by her,</i>

01:52.305 --> 01:53.852
<i>and the next thing you know...</i>

01:53.974 --> 01:55.976
Little man, what do you think of that?

01:56.601 --> 01:57.853
Not much.

01:57.936 --> 01:59.734
Well, that's honest.

01:59.813 --> 02:00.860
Timothy's very honest, ma'am.

02:00.939 --> 02:05.115
That was done by a renowned artist
at great expense.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.866
I would have done it for free.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.369
Are you suggesting
you could do it better?

02:11.074 --> 02:12.246
I can try.

02:13.618 --> 02:15.620
Well, let's find out.

02:17.163 --> 02:20.007
May I just remind you,
ma'am, as his parent,

02:20.083 --> 02:21.130
that he is only ten years old, and...

02:21.209 --> 02:22.552
Don't you have somewhere to be?

02:22.627 --> 02:23.924
Of course I do, but...

02:24.879 --> 02:26.051
- Shoo.
- Okay.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074

03:40.789 --> 03:41.790
Oh!

03:44.167 --> 03:45.965
Oh, sweetie.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.722
Oh, it's beautiful. It's amazing.

03:49.839 --> 03:51.136
It's amazing.

03:53.134 --> 03:55.182
Oh, no, no, no.
Erase that.

03:55.428 --> 03:56.771
Why?

03:58.306 --> 04:02.937
<i>It turns out, Timothy
was Picasso with a pencil.</i>

04:03.019 --> 04:05.317
<i>So he had
all the qualities you imagined?</i>

04:05.480 --> 04:06.481
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

04:06.731 --> 04:09.860
<i>Yeah, well,
including honest to a fault.</i>

04:22.163 --> 04:24.416
<i>He couldn't help
but draw her exactly as he saw her.</i>

04:24.499 --> 04:25.591
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:26.084 --> 04:28.928
It included an unfortunate
thatch of chin hair.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.004
Mmm.

04:36.261 --> 04:39.731
So, what else aren't you telling me?

04:41.975 --> 04:43.022
Tell her.

04:43.435 --> 04:44.812
Hmm?

04:45.019 --> 04:46.145
I'm waiting.

04:46.813 --> 04:49.111
Sometimes you wear
plaids and stripes that clash.

04:49.858 --> 04:51.201
Hmm.

04:51.401 --> 04:54.154
Your one joke that
you always tell, it's not funny.

04:55.447 --> 04:57.950
No one can appreciate the art in here

04:58.032 --> 04:59.750
because everything
that is special and beautiful,

04:59.826 --> 05:01.328
no one can see
because the curtains are so thick

05:01.411 --> 05:03.413
that the light can't get in.

05:03.496 --> 05:05.919
Not to mention, if someone has a child

05:05.999 --> 05:08.969
who just is born or appears,

05:09.335 --> 05:11.383
say congratulations with a smile.

05:11.504 --> 05:13.381
Say something nice.

05:14.048 --> 05:15.300
I wanted to love you,

05:15.383 --> 05:16.976
and I have tried so hard to like you.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.895
But if someone asked me to be
a pallbearer at your funeral,

05:19.971 --> 05:23.396
I would tell them not by
the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.

05:23.933 --> 05:25.059
And furthermore...

05:25.143 --> 05:27.191
- Cindy lost her job.
- I lost my job.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.908
I didn't regret most of what I said.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.282
But you lost your job.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.827
Make sure all the pencils are good.

05:38.907 --> 05:40.784
<i>So things were going to get harder.</i>

05:40.867 --> 05:42.585
<i>But at least I still had my job.</i>

05:42.827 --> 05:44.044
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

05:44.537 --> 05:47.256
They go in this box.
They go on a little pencil vacation.

05:47.332 --> 05:48.379
<i>And what did you say about</i>

05:48.458 --> 05:50.176
<i>having Timothy with you that day?</i>

05:50.251 --> 05:52.094
<i>- Oh, right.</i>
- That's a lot of trees.

05:52.837 --> 05:54.134
<i>I couldn't help but feel...</i>

05:54.214 --> 05:55.261
Mind if I have one?

05:55.423 --> 05:56.549
<i>...anything was possible.</i>

05:56.883 --> 05:58.298
You want another one?
You want a yellow one?

05:58.343 --> 06:00.220
We got this... You see, we got a whole...

06:00.303 --> 06:02.226
- Right back.
- Good luck, Dad.

06:02.597 --> 06:04.895
<i>So Jim gave it his best shot.</i>

06:05.016 --> 06:06.893
Sir? How you doing?

06:08.520 --> 06:09.897
- Huh?
- Do you have a minute?

06:10.271 --> 06:11.272
No.

06:13.107 --> 06:16.281
Oh, hell. Why not?
Turns out we may all get the axe.

06:17.445 --> 06:18.446
What?

06:18.530 --> 06:20.453
Then I think we got nothing to lose.

06:20.532 --> 06:23.376
What if we made a new kind of pencil?

06:55.525 --> 06:58.404
Come on, Erasers!
Come on! Come on!

06:58.486 --> 07:01.080
Push up the field! Push up the field!

07:01.155 --> 07:04.534
Don't pass it!
How do you score if you pass it!

07:05.326 --> 07:07.670
Kick it! Kick the ball!

07:08.663 --> 07:10.085
- Mom! I'm so thirsty.
- What are you doing?

07:10.248 --> 07:12.626
No, no, no. Get back on D. Back on D!

07:16.045 --> 07:17.137
Come on!

07:18.548 --> 07:22.052
I saw your car.
Didn't know the kid was a player.

07:22.135 --> 07:23.432
What position? Striker?

07:23.511 --> 07:24.558
Uh...

07:24.637 --> 07:27.481
Well, he's taking a break right now.

07:27.557 --> 07:30.026
Oh, well, I got time.

07:31.019 --> 07:32.271
It might be a while.

07:34.272 --> 07:35.990
You know, I'm impressed, Dad.

07:36.608 --> 07:38.201
You never really came to my games.

07:38.359 --> 07:42.205
No. I came.
You were always on the bench.

07:43.031 --> 07:46.501
Come on, Luke.
Find your man. Find your man!

07:46.701 --> 07:48.044
You got to want it!

07:48.119 --> 07:49.245
Oh, here we go.

07:49.370 --> 07:51.122
Come on, I want to see some fight!

07:51.247 --> 07:52.624
To keep you hydrated, sir.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.175
Thank you.

07:57.462 --> 07:58.930
He's a water boy.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.257
No. Dad,

08:01.341 --> 08:04.345
actually, I'm working
on all aspects of his game right now.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.392
And you know what...

08:07.555 --> 08:10.183
Come on, Erasers.
Keep your head in the game.

08:10.266 --> 08:11.392
Let's go, Bobby! Let's go!

08:11.476 --> 08:12.978
Good pass. Good pass.

08:16.397 --> 08:18.320
- All right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:19.067 --> 08:20.410
Good eye! Good eye!

08:20.485 --> 08:21.737
Talk to each other!

08:21.986 --> 08:24.489
Erasers, talk to each other!

08:24.572 --> 08:26.995
That's your house, Philip!

08:27.075 --> 08:28.702
Don't let nothing in there!
That's your house!

08:28.826 --> 08:29.702
That's your house!

08:36.542 --> 08:38.590
<i>All this time, it felt like</i>

08:38.669 --> 08:41.264
<i>there was something
Timothy wasn't telling us.</i>

08:50.390 --> 08:53.189
<i>And he was spending
far too much time with that girl.</i>

08:53.267 --> 08:55.019
<i>Was it a problem for you?</i>

08:56.771 --> 08:58.489
<i>Well,
they were up to something,</i>

08:58.564 --> 08:59.531
<i>and we didn't know what.</i>

09:01.401 --> 09:03.369
Can you teach me to do that thing?

09:03.444 --> 09:05.037
You know, that you do with your arms

09:05.113 --> 09:06.706
and you put your head up in the sun.

09:06.781 --> 09:08.124
Well, first, find the light, all right?

09:08.199 --> 09:09.200
Okay.

09:09.283 --> 09:14.039
Just absorb it.
Just soak it in. Think "tree."

09:15.540 --> 09:17.338
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, I feel it.

09:18.459 --> 09:19.551
Nice.

09:21.087 --> 09:22.680
Maybe you should show your birthmark,

09:22.755 --> 09:24.348
because people might like it.

09:24.424 --> 09:25.425
I don't know.

09:25.508 --> 09:28.307
<i>We didn't know
what he was doing with the girl.</i>

09:28.386 --> 09:29.979
It was fine if he wanted to have a secret

09:30.054 --> 09:32.148
as long as he shared it with us.

09:34.434 --> 09:36.607
<i>So Cindy did
what she thought was best.</i>

09:45.987 --> 09:46.988
Hey!

09:47.739 --> 09:49.036
Hey!

09:53.077 --> 09:54.169
We need to talk.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.542
Okay, let's talk.

09:56.664 --> 09:57.790
Well, can you wait?

09:59.333 --> 10:00.459
Fine.

10:03.671 --> 10:07.847
I don't think that
you're the best influence on my son,

10:08.092 --> 10:10.094
and I want you
to tell me what you know about him.

10:10.178 --> 10:11.350
I know a lot.

10:11.429 --> 10:12.555
I thought so.

10:13.347 --> 10:14.769
So you know that he's got...

10:16.768 --> 10:18.315
You know that he's different.

10:18.436 --> 10:20.780
Yeah. It's what I like about him.

10:22.565 --> 10:24.363
Well, it's a hard world to be different in.

10:25.485 --> 10:26.862
And I don't want him to be hurt.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.322
By you or anyone. I won't let it happen.

10:29.447 --> 10:30.539
That's good.

10:32.784 --> 10:34.252
What is this?

10:35.495 --> 10:37.372
He's going to be misunderstood.

10:38.831 --> 10:40.833
Lots of people hate anything different.

10:42.752 --> 10:44.425
I wish it wasn't this way, but

10:45.254 --> 10:47.677
I wish a lot of things. I wish...

11:01.813 --> 11:05.738
<i>It took my breath away,
this world they created.</i>

11:08.694 --> 11:10.162
<i>I was wrong</i>

11:10.696 --> 11:13.666
<i>about this, this girl.</i>

11:25.253 --> 11:26.550
You did this?

11:26.671 --> 11:29.390
Yeah. Timothy and I did it together.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.516
<i>I had made a mistake.</i>

11:31.592 --> 11:32.684
<i>We made lots of mistakes.</i>

11:32.760 --> 11:35.764
Yeah, we made mistakes
trying to fix our mistakes.

11:35.847 --> 11:37.599
Isn't that how you know you're a parent?

11:41.435 --> 11:43.483
You seem to forget
what the object is here.

11:43.604 --> 11:45.402
You need to persuade us.

11:45.481 --> 11:47.779
Tell me, what would you do differently?

11:49.527 --> 11:50.949
We'd make better mistakes?

11:51.195 --> 11:52.617
- Better?
- Different. New.

11:52.697 --> 11:53.823
New mistakes.

11:53.906 --> 11:56.204
That's... That's what we'd do.

11:56.284 --> 11:57.376
Yeah.

11:58.536 --> 12:00.789
Put your
heart into it, Erasers!

12:01.956 --> 12:03.378
Smarten up out there.

12:03.457 --> 12:04.629
Bobby.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.677
The most amazing thing happened.

12:07.753 --> 12:09.881
I woke up this morning
and I started to draw again.

12:09.964 --> 12:12.558
Oh, God! It must be so nice to
have time to waste.

12:12.633 --> 12:13.634
It was like coming home.

12:13.718 --> 12:16.221
My three are so busy with
their second languages,

12:16.304 --> 12:17.305
their public service work...

12:17.388 --> 12:18.935
Oh, and their upcoming music recital.

12:19.015 --> 12:20.733
Your presence is expected.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.903
Let's go, Erasers! Come on!

12:26.898 --> 12:28.616
Brenda's freaking me out.

12:30.735 --> 12:31.987
What's wrong?

12:33.905 --> 12:35.657
If you're on the bench now,

12:36.032 --> 12:38.455
you'll be on the bench of life later on.

12:38.534 --> 12:40.457
Jim, that is your father talking.

12:40.578 --> 12:41.955
Coach. Coach!

12:42.455 --> 12:43.923
Put Green in!

12:44.624 --> 12:45.750
Come on.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.460
Good, Coach. Thank you.

12:47.543 --> 12:48.760
What are you doing? No, no, no. Jim...

12:48.836 --> 12:49.883
Put...

12:51.672 --> 12:52.844
What's going on?

12:53.841 --> 12:55.935
Oh, great.
Now he's going to do that again.

12:56.010 --> 12:57.432
What?

12:57.511 --> 13:00.264
He's going to uncross his arms,
crack his knuckles,

13:00.348 --> 13:01.474
then he will turn and go.

13:01.557 --> 13:02.604
Yep.

13:02.683 --> 13:04.401
It's fine that he did that to me,

13:04.477 --> 13:05.854
but now he's doing it to Timothy.

13:06.395 --> 13:07.521
Hey, Jim...

13:07.688 --> 13:09.486
Look. Look.

13:12.610 --> 13:13.782
Here, Grandpa Jim.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.785
You know
what I feel really good about?

13:16.864 --> 13:18.832
Bart and I are just grateful
that our kids' school

13:18.908 --> 13:20.706
has a gifted and talented program.

13:21.577 --> 13:22.954
Did you know Timothy is gifted?

13:23.037 --> 13:24.380
How so?

13:24.872 --> 13:25.919
Well...

13:27.041 --> 13:29.043
He always finds the bright side.

13:29.377 --> 13:31.880
He never gives up
and he has a good heart.

13:32.046 --> 13:33.923
That will get you into college.

13:36.634 --> 13:38.602
- He's a great artist.
- Look where that got you.

13:38.678 --> 13:39.770
Get open!

13:39.887 --> 13:42.640
Brenda, I have to say, lam...

13:42.723 --> 13:44.020
What? I'm listening.

13:44.976 --> 13:46.068
He's musical.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.397
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:50.564 --> 13:51.941
What instruments does he play?

13:55.027 --> 13:57.576
"He's musical?"
What possessed you to even say that?

13:57.738 --> 13:59.661
She just kept bragging
about how her kids could do this,

13:59.740 --> 14:00.787
her kids could do that.

14:00.866 --> 14:03.836
<i>So Cindy's sister
has this yearly family concert</i>

14:03.911 --> 14:05.413
<i>that we never seem to miss.</i>

14:05.496 --> 14:07.669
<i>If I'd known
what she was going to pull that day,</i>

14:07.748 --> 14:08.749
<i>we never would have shown up.</i>

14:24.098 --> 14:26.601
Thank you. Thank you.

14:27.435 --> 14:28.482
Brilliant.

14:28.602 --> 14:31.902
Thank you. This year
we are going to dispense

14:31.981 --> 14:33.858
with our traditional encore.

14:33.941 --> 14:34.988
Oh!

14:35.109 --> 14:38.830
Because we have a very special treat.

14:38.904 --> 14:44.126
Sit back and enjoy
the musical stylings of Timothy Green!

14:44.827 --> 14:46.955
You know what?
We're running late to something.

14:47.038 --> 14:48.460
Go ahead and do the encore because...

14:48.581 --> 14:50.800
No, Mom, it's okay. It's fine, Mom.

14:52.084 --> 14:53.085
Um, Timothy?

14:53.169 --> 14:54.512
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

14:54.587 --> 14:55.634
It's okay.

15:11.771 --> 15:13.739
Just get him, baby. Just go.

15:14.607 --> 15:15.904
Just get him. Get him.

15:17.651 --> 15:18.777
Just go get him.

15:18.861 --> 15:20.158
Hey, pal?

15:43.844 --> 15:47.940
<i>All my friends know the low rider</i>

15:50.851 --> 15:54.856
<i>The low rider is a little higher</i>

16:18.879 --> 16:20.051
Yeah!

16:31.100 --> 16:32.101
Yeah!

16:32.518 --> 16:33.815
Can we go back and do it again?

16:33.894 --> 16:35.020
- No.

16:35.104 --> 16:36.651
I don't think we'll be invited back.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.824
But it doesn't matter
because you were great.

16:38.899 --> 16:39.991
You rock, buddy.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.819
It felt great to rock.

16:41.902 --> 16:43.904
It felt great to have a kid who rocked.

16:44.989 --> 16:46.206
- Good night.
- Good night.

16:46.991 --> 16:48.288
It was all you.

16:48.576 --> 16:49.953
And us, but mostly you.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.124
Hey.

16:53.914 --> 16:55.712
- We were proud of you.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.753
Turn the lights off in five, okay?

16:59.587 --> 17:00.804
Good night!

17:05.759 --> 17:06.760
We rocked!

17:06.886 --> 17:07.853
We did.

17:07.928 --> 17:08.929
We rocked!

17:09.012 --> 17:10.138
You know what this means?

17:10.222 --> 17:11.690
I think I do!

17:12.266 --> 17:14.734
This Sunday at the championship game

17:14.810 --> 17:18.565
our son is going to
score the winning goal.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.632
Whoo! Let's go!

17:46.342 --> 17:49.061
Ha! Yeah! Let's go!

17:53.224 --> 17:54.316
All right, way to go, Coach!

17:57.436 --> 17:58.483
No! No!

17:58.562 --> 18:01.156
No, no, no. No, you don't! Not this time!

18:01.607 --> 18:03.609
- You are staying for this one!
- I can't stay.

18:03.692 --> 18:05.239
- You're staying.
- I got lots, I got a lot...

18:05.319 --> 18:06.866
You will not be sorry!

18:08.906 --> 18:10.158
I promise you.

18:12.326 --> 18:14.078
- Okay.
- All right. Come on! Come on!

18:15.079 --> 18:16.171
Yes!

18:19.667 --> 18:22.090
Hey, Jim, how's he going to
score the winning goal

18:22.169 --> 18:23.921
if he's never in the game?

18:24.004 --> 18:25.130
Good point.

18:26.882 --> 18:29.931
Hey, Coach. Coach, I just want
to give you the heads-up.

18:30.010 --> 18:32.729
Timothy Green is
your difference-maker today.

18:32.805 --> 18:34.227
That is your game-changer right there.

18:34.306 --> 18:35.899
You're kidding, right?

18:35.975 --> 18:37.318
Do I look like I'm kidding?

18:37.393 --> 18:38.940
If I put your son in the game,

18:39.019 --> 18:40.612
he wouldn't live to see his next birthday.

18:40.688 --> 18:42.281
If you don't mind, we got a game to win.

18:42.356 --> 18:44.984
Erasers, this is our time.
This is our time.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.819
Warm him up, Coach!

18:46.902 --> 18:48.904
Come on, Timothy!
Let's see you run some drills.

18:48.988 --> 18:50.865
How about he runs some drills, Coach?

18:51.907 --> 18:53.204
You better stretch, baby!

18:53.742 --> 18:55.085
What did he say?

18:55.202 --> 18:57.671
- He's going to play.
- Is he going to do it?

19:00.958 --> 19:03.052
Get open! Get open!
That's yours right there!

19:03.127 --> 19:05.676
There you go, son. There you go, son.

19:08.382 --> 19:12.057
All right, Erasers!
Bring the championship home!

19:19.268 --> 19:20.736
Spread out!

19:42.416 --> 19:43.918
- Yes!
- Oh!

19:44.001 --> 19:45.093
- No! Jim!
- No!

19:46.003 --> 19:47.255
Is he okay?

19:48.088 --> 19:49.385
I hope he's okay.

19:50.424 --> 19:51.767
Oh, no!

19:52.217 --> 19:53.389
Time! Time!

19:55.095 --> 19:56.392
It's going to be okay.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.683
- Who's that?
- I have no idea.

19:59.767 --> 20:01.269
- Is that the Henderson kid?
- Maybe.

20:01.977 --> 20:03.069
He's not that good.

20:04.980 --> 20:05.981
He's okay!

20:06.273 --> 20:08.822
He's okay! It's okay.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.248
I can get you some water.

20:15.074 --> 20:16.917
- Way to go-
- Okay.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.834
- Watch this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:21.914 --> 20:22.961
This is what we've been waiting for.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.041
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:24.124 --> 20:26.172
- He's coming in.
- We're going with ten.

20:26.377 --> 20:27.879
- Okay, Coach.
- What?

20:27.961 --> 20:29.804
No, no. Ref, come here.

20:30.506 --> 20:32.224
They've only got ten kids on the field.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.097
What about zero?
Why isn't zero playing?

20:34.176 --> 20:35.519
- I thought he was a mascot.
- No.

20:35.719 --> 20:37.187
No, he's on the team.

20:38.180 --> 20:39.898
There's got to be a rule.

20:40.766 --> 20:43.394
Get the book.
Hundred fifty-four rule or whatever.

20:43.519 --> 20:44.987
Jim, is there a rule?

20:46.980 --> 20:48.068
Coach, you need 11 players on the field.

20:48.107 --> 20:49.074
He doesn't play.

20:49.149 --> 20:50.150
Is he on your team?

20:50.234 --> 20:51.235
Yeah, he's on the team, but...

20:51.318 --> 20:53.161
Then he plays. Let's go, Coach.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.458
Okay, Green, come on. Come on.

21:10.087 --> 21:12.181
Our son's going to
score the winning goal.

21:14.258 --> 21:17.512
I want you to plant your feet
right here, son. Okay?

21:18.220 --> 21:20.314
And whatever you do,
don't move from this spot.

21:20.389 --> 21:21.390
You're safe here, okay?

21:21.473 --> 21:23.020
- Got it, Coach.
- All right. There you go.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.226
Coach, let's go.

21:24.309 --> 21:25.902
All right, buddy. This is what it's about!

21:26.895 --> 21:28.568
This is where you find out who you are.

21:30.816 --> 21:32.910
No more bench of life.

21:33.026 --> 21:34.494
Oh, hit me with a stick.

21:34.570 --> 21:36.117
They're not putting that boy in!

21:36.196 --> 21:39.245
Actually, they are. It's good. Trust me.

21:39.533 --> 21:41.206
- Laugh if you want.

21:41.285 --> 21:43.208
My kid is going to
score the winning goal.

21:45.122 --> 21:46.874
Two minutes left in the game.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.209
Who's your daddy?

21:49.168 --> 21:50.260
Has he been drinking?

21:50.335 --> 21:52.429
No, no. He just knows what's coming.

21:53.422 --> 21:54.844
Come on, Timothy!

21:55.257 --> 21:57.100
Do that thing you're going to do!

21:58.552 --> 21:59.895
This is it. Come on!

22:00.554 --> 22:02.056
Come on,
Erasers, let's go!

22:02.139 --> 22:03.937
You can do it! You can do it!

22:04.057 --> 22:06.276
Let's go! Let me see
some fight, Erasers!

22:06.894 --> 22:08.316
Put some heart into it!

22:10.189 --> 22:11.566
That's what I'm talking about, Green.

22:11.899 --> 22:13.901
That's what
I'm talking about. Keep that up.

22:14.109 --> 22:15.235
Timothy. Timothy.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.529
You got to move your feet. Come on.

22:18.363 --> 22:19.956
No. Stay right there, son.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.950
- Stay right there.
- Don't listen to Coach Cal!

22:22.075 --> 22:23.372
Don't listen to your father!

22:23.452 --> 22:25.329
Timothy, Timothy.
Look at me. Don't listen to Coach Cal.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.005
Move your feet. Move around!

22:27.206 --> 22:29.629
Green, Green. Stay right there.
You're doing great!

22:29.917 --> 22:30.964
Feel it out, Timothy!

22:31.084 --> 22:32.427
Come on, move around!

22:32.544 --> 22:34.922
Chase the ball! Come on!

22:36.256 --> 22:38.930
Way to go. Way to go. Way to go, Tim.

23:02.366 --> 23:03.583
God, he's doing that thing again.

23:03.659 --> 23:06.208
No, no. Put your arms down. Arms down.

23:06.286 --> 23:07.412
Get your head in the game, baby!

23:07.496 --> 23:08.497
Get your head in the game.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.173
Get in the game!

23:10.249 --> 23:12.343
Like we worked it, come on!

23:34.690 --> 23:36.567
There you go, Erasers,
there you go!

23:36.692 --> 23:38.035
Yes! Yes!

23:38.110 --> 23:39.657
There it is! There it is!

23:39.945 --> 23:41.242
Get back in! Get back in!

23:43.156 --> 23:44.658
- Oh, my boy! This is it!
- This is your moment!

23:45.284 --> 23:46.661
No, no, no! Don't do that!

23:47.244 --> 23:49.542
Do something with it! Do something!

23:53.000 --> 23:54.172
- Yes! Yes!
- Come on!

23:54.501 --> 23:55.502
Yes!

23:55.586 --> 23:56.963
That's what we're talking about.

24:00.257 --> 24:03.261
All right, Green!
Come on! That's your house!

24:06.013 --> 24:07.560
Just like we practiced!

24:08.557 --> 24:10.150
Look at his little legs!

24:10.225 --> 24:11.317
I don't believe it.

24:11.393 --> 24:12.690
Oh, believe it, sister.

24:12.978 --> 24:15.652
For years I've been listening to
how perfect your kids are!

24:15.731 --> 24:18.234
Well, look at that! That kid is mine!

24:19.276 --> 24:21.074
I am the mom of that!

24:22.446 --> 24:24.540
Get that kid! Put him on the ground!

24:25.324 --> 24:27.622
Take his knees out!
Put him on the ground!

24:30.120 --> 24:32.464
See? See?

24:32.539 --> 24:34.541
See what happens
when you're there for your kid!

24:34.625 --> 24:36.423
Huh? See what happens
when you believe in him! Huh?

24:36.501 --> 24:40.096
I could have been like that,
because I had skills, but no.

24:40.172 --> 24:42.641
Come on, Timothy! Go! Go!

24:42.716 --> 24:44.138
Go, Timothy! Go!

25:02.069 --> 25:03.161
No!

25:06.406 --> 25:07.749
That's the wrong goal!

25:08.033 --> 25:09.250
Game Bone Crushers!

25:11.078 --> 25:12.170
Oh!

25:15.540 --> 25:16.587
Oh!

25:21.630 --> 25:22.722
But he...

25:46.113 --> 25:47.365
Just like you practiced it, huh?

26:12.472 --> 26:14.566
When we're dreaming up the kid that
we never thought we would get,

26:14.641 --> 26:16.083
I should have said,
"The winning goal for his team!"

26:16.143 --> 26:17.558
- That's not what I'm saying!
- What are you saying?

26:17.561 --> 26:18.562
Shut up!

26:18.645 --> 26:19.771
It was a failure of my imagination!

26:19.855 --> 26:21.528
Your mistake was simple!

26:21.606 --> 26:24.075
Oh, my mistake?
So, you think it was my fault?

26:24.151 --> 26:26.324
You needed him to
score for you to make you...

26:27.279 --> 26:29.327
Tell me you didn't love

26:29.406 --> 26:31.408
the idea of rubbing it in Brenda's face.

26:31.533 --> 26:32.580
Oh, please!

26:32.659 --> 26:34.707
You think you're better than your sister,
and you're not.

26:34.786 --> 26:36.834
You are worse than your father!

26:38.749 --> 26:39.841
What?

26:46.506 --> 26:47.678
No.

26:49.301 --> 26:50.427
No, no, no.

26:50.510 --> 26:51.807
Stop it!

26:53.305 --> 26:56.149
I am not the only bad parent
in this house!

26:56.224 --> 26:57.567
Look, it's not a competition

26:57.642 --> 26:59.269
to see who can be the worst parent!

26:59.352 --> 27:01.229
No, I am saying
we're both terrible at this!

27:01.313 --> 27:03.111
We are! We don't know anything!

27:03.190 --> 27:04.487
You're right! We know nothing!

27:04.566 --> 27:06.660
We were monsters out there today.

27:06.735 --> 27:08.612
Stop! Stop fighting!

27:08.695 --> 27:09.821
Oh, God.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.326
I need to tell you something.

27:14.409 --> 27:16.377
Buddy, we want to tell you something.

27:16.453 --> 27:17.579
- No!
- You deserve better.

27:17.662 --> 27:19.664
We will be better parents.
We will do better.

27:19.748 --> 27:21.125
- I promise.
- Please...

27:21.208 --> 27:22.300
Stop.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.179
Your time is up.

27:26.296 --> 27:27.388
- No, it can't be.
- No.

27:27.464 --> 27:28.556
Actually, you ran over.

27:28.632 --> 27:30.509
- By three minutes.
- You have to let us finish.

27:30.592 --> 27:32.811
You have to hear the whole thing.
You have to.

27:32.886 --> 27:35.264
Excuse me.
With all due respect, we're not leaving.

27:43.271 --> 27:44.318
Okay.

27:46.358 --> 27:49.237
Tots, Timbo? There you go.

27:52.572 --> 27:53.869
Get them next year.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.244
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

28:01.581 --> 28:03.583
Boys, come on.
We're going home.

28:04.251 --> 28:05.628
We're going home! What did I say?

28:05.710 --> 28:07.712
No, that's somebody's job. Let's go.

28:10.257 --> 28:11.509
Mom and Dad?

28:13.552 --> 28:16.522
This is Joni,
the coolest girl you ever hope to meet.

28:18.431 --> 28:19.478
Wow. Hi.

28:19.933 --> 28:21.776
Nice to see you again.

28:21.852 --> 28:22.944
Hi.

28:23.812 --> 28:26.565
Well, okay, bye.

28:30.777 --> 28:31.824
There it is.

28:32.946 --> 28:34.448
Love and be loved.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.872
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.

28:42.956 --> 28:44.674
Let them go. Let them go.

28:52.924 --> 28:53.971
Yeah.

28:55.594 --> 28:57.471
I know we've
had a great time together.

28:57.554 --> 28:58.646
Me, too.

28:59.306 --> 29:01.729
I didn't tell my parents because

29:01.975 --> 29:04.194
they could n't have
done anything about it.

29:07.397 --> 29:09.240
There's something
you need to know about me.

29:09.316 --> 29:10.317
What is it?

29:23.997 --> 29:25.999
There's nothing I can do about it.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.173
Everything's going to be okay.

29:37.177 --> 29:38.269
Good night.

29:38.345 --> 29:39.517
Oh, good night.

29:39.596 --> 29:40.688
Timothy!

29:47.187 --> 29:49.189
Oh, I am so confused.

30:11.211 --> 30:12.258
Guys?

30:13.505 --> 30:14.597
Oh, hey!

30:16.549 --> 30:17.596
We were spying.

30:17.676 --> 30:18.973
Yeah, we couldn't help ourselves.

30:19.052 --> 30:20.645
- Oh, she's lovely.
- Yeah.

30:21.221 --> 30:23.019
We really like her.

30:23.098 --> 30:24.099
Yeah.

30:24.224 --> 30:25.441
I more than like her.

30:25.517 --> 30:26.985
Well, of course.

30:27.060 --> 30:28.437
I don't mean to pry, buddy,

30:28.520 --> 30:30.318
but it looks like
you just broke up with her.

30:30.522 --> 30:33.321
No. I let her go.

30:34.234 --> 30:35.577
Why would you do that?

30:35.652 --> 30:36.659
Especially if you more than like her.

30:36.736 --> 30:37.737
Yeah.

30:38.738 --> 30:40.365
You don't get it.

30:44.744 --> 30:46.121
<i>He was right.</i>

30:47.205 --> 30:48.457
We didn't get it.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.585
But we were about to.

30:52.544 --> 30:53.716
We just want to work!

30:53.795 --> 30:54.717
Yeah, we want to work.

30:55.463 --> 30:56.680
My grandfather worked for you.

30:57.090 --> 30:59.184
My father did. My brothers.

30:59.259 --> 31:01.682
24 years! He's given you 24 years!

31:01.761 --> 31:02.853
<i>The meeting was about</i>

31:02.929 --> 31:04.522
<i>whether the factory was going to close.</i>

31:04.597 --> 31:06.565
- And the whole town showed up.
- Everybody.

31:07.100 --> 31:08.852
<i>Good evening.
I know you're all upset,</i>

31:09.102 --> 31:10.479
<i>but if you could just
give me a few minutes.</i>

31:11.229 --> 31:12.856
<i>You've heard the rumors</i>

31:12.939 --> 31:14.486
<i>that our factory here in Stanleyville</i>

31:14.566 --> 31:15.783
<i>is going to close.</i>

31:16.151 --> 31:19.121
That's what we thought.
As it turned out...

31:19.237 --> 31:24.118
<i>But... But something
unexpected happened.</i>

31:24.534 --> 31:28.380
<i>A little miracle. And here it is.</i>

31:29.706 --> 31:31.549
<i>This is a new kind of pencil</i>

31:31.624 --> 31:34.548
<i>made almost entirely out of leaves.</i>

31:34.627 --> 31:35.628
<i>A new kind of pencil.</i>

31:37.255 --> 31:39.223
The pencil that Timothy
had asked us to make.

31:39.424 --> 31:43.600
<i>It will not only save trees,
but will save our factory.</i>

31:49.642 --> 31:50.814
<i>Don't thank me.</i>

31:50.894 --> 31:52.237
<i>I did not have the vision</i>

31:52.312 --> 31:53.905
<i>to come up with this revolutionary idea.</i>

31:54.314 --> 31:57.284
<i>But allow me to
introduce you to who did.</i>

31:58.777 --> 32:02.247
<i>My son, Franklin Crudstaff.</i>

32:07.494 --> 32:12.216
<i>I can't begin to
describe the feeling of pride I have.</i>

32:12.665 --> 32:14.167
<i>Quite frankly, Franklin,</i>

32:14.250 --> 32:16.344
<i>I didn't think you had it in you.</i>

32:16.628 --> 32:17.675
<i>He didn't.</i>

32:18.838 --> 32:20.431
<i>He didn't have it in him.</i>

32:20.507 --> 32:22.305
<i>The new pencil
was thought up by my parents,</i>

32:22.383 --> 32:23.509
<i>Jim and Cindy Green.</i>

32:25.178 --> 32:26.145
<i>Oh, look here.</i>

32:26.221 --> 32:27.313
<i>It's the boy who kicked the winning goal</i>

32:27.388 --> 32:28.765
<i>for the other team.</i>

32:30.141 --> 32:31.939
Hey, hey, stop, Franklin.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.316
<i>Well, he's obviously confused again.</i>

32:34.395 --> 32:36.318
<i>He shoots. He scores. We lose.</i>

32:36.439 --> 32:40.410
<i>Hey! Enough. Do not pick on my son.</i>

32:42.403 --> 32:43.575
<i>The truth is,</i>

32:43.655 --> 32:46.875
<i>the only reason that
Cindy and I came up</i>

32:46.950 --> 32:48.623
<i>with the idea for the leaf pencil</i>

32:48.701 --> 32:51.454
<i>is because he believed
that we could. He's the reason.</i>

32:52.372 --> 32:53.624
<i>And if you call him a liar,</i>

32:53.706 --> 32:56.425
<i>if you ever so much as
even look at him funny,</i>

32:56.501 --> 32:58.174
<i>you will have to deal with me.</i>

32:58.253 --> 32:59.345
And me.

33:05.927 --> 33:07.270
How touching.

33:10.390 --> 33:13.894
Tell me, how did you
come up with this idea

33:13.977 --> 33:16.730
to make a pencil out of leaves.

33:17.272 --> 33:18.398
Franklin?

33:22.443 --> 33:24.866
<i>Well, it seems kind of obvious, really.</i>

33:25.572 --> 33:28.792
<i>Uh, leaves are everywhere. And, uh...</i>

33:30.743 --> 33:32.370
- ...pencil.
<i>- How about you?</i>

33:34.998 --> 33:38.502
<i>Ever since Timothy came to us,
leaves have been a big,</i>

33:39.586 --> 33:40.929
<i>a big part of our lives.</i>

33:41.296 --> 33:42.593
<i>Why?</i>

33:44.757 --> 33:45.758
<i>Well?</i>

33:46.759 --> 33:48.511
<i>Because I have leaves on my legs.</i>

33:51.431 --> 33:52.899
<i>Leaves on your legs.</i>

33:54.267 --> 33:58.613
<i>Yes. Our son, Timothy,
has leaves on his legs.</i>

34:02.317 --> 34:04.786
<i>And we didn't tell
you guys because we were afraid.</i>

34:06.946 --> 34:08.447
<i>And kind of ashamed.</i>

34:10.491 --> 34:12.289
<i>I even tried to cut his leaves off.</i>

34:12.409 --> 34:14.708
<i>Surely you don't
expect us to believe that...</i>

34:14.786 --> 34:16.289
I've seen the leaves.

34:17.373 --> 34:18.498
They're spectacular.

34:19.751 --> 34:22.550
And it's okay to be different.
A little weird, even.

34:24.964 --> 34:25.965
Thank you.

34:28.842 --> 34:30.516
<i>It doesn't matter if you believe us or not.</i>

34:30.594 --> 34:32.313
<i>I'd like to see the leaves.</i>

34:39.603 --> 34:41.606
It is up to you. You don't have to.

34:41.688 --> 34:44.317
It's okay. It's time.

35:01.626 --> 35:02.673
Oops.

35:15.682 --> 35:17.776
Now that's amazing.

35:19.978 --> 35:21.525
<i>I used to have more.</i>

35:23.106 --> 35:25.655
<i>If this boy can
have a leaf on his ankle,</i>

35:25.733 --> 35:27.952
<i>then we can make
a pencil out of leaves.</i>

35:28.611 --> 35:30.079
<i>Let's all go to work!</i>

35:40.415 --> 35:42.588
Wow!
You guys were incredible.

35:42.709 --> 35:45.588
Timothy, what happened to your leaves?

35:46.629 --> 35:48.051
Oh, you know.

35:48.798 --> 35:51.392
No. We don't know.

35:52.010 --> 35:53.478
He wouldn't tell us.

35:53.553 --> 35:54.805
No. He was quiet.

36:09.068 --> 36:11.867
<i>We were in
the middle of something.</i>

36:11.946 --> 36:13.698
<i>We didn't know what.</i>

36:17.744 --> 36:20.748
<i>But Timothy knew. He stayed calm.</i>

36:21.497 --> 36:24.046
<i>He knew, and he was okay with it.</i>

36:33.468 --> 36:34.765
It was beautiful.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.017
It was really beautiful.

36:39.432 --> 36:40.604
Timothy.

36:41.809 --> 36:43.106
What aren't you telling us?

36:44.854 --> 36:46.106
We should get inside.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.153
- Get inside.
- Come on.

36:58.076 --> 36:59.043
I didn't tell you before

36:59.118 --> 37:00.961
because there's nothing
you could have done.

37:04.624 --> 37:06.046
About my leaves...

37:07.043 --> 37:08.135
What about them?

37:09.796 --> 37:10.843
Please, please tell us.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.433
When my leaves go...

37:17.512 --> 37:19.014
You go, too, don't you?

37:23.976 --> 37:25.478
When?

37:33.569 --> 37:34.570
Now.

37:34.779 --> 37:36.076
No, no.

37:36.656 --> 37:39.000
No, sweetie. You can't.

37:39.158 --> 37:42.162
It's nothing you did.
It's how it's supposed to be.

37:42.745 --> 37:44.167
There's only so much time.

37:45.498 --> 37:47.751
Other kids grow up and move away.

37:48.668 --> 37:50.636
I lose my leaves and move on.

37:50.753 --> 37:51.879
Oh, sweetie, you can't.

37:52.547 --> 37:54.675
There is so much that we have left to do.

37:54.757 --> 37:56.805
We're just starting to get good at this.

37:56.884 --> 37:58.511
You're ready.

37:59.137 --> 38:00.889
- You were always ready.
- Oh, baby.

38:05.393 --> 38:06.565
Never give up.

38:15.653 --> 38:16.654
Timothy?

38:17.196 --> 38:18.618
- Timothy?
- Jim.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.129
Oh!

38:31.669 --> 38:32.921
- Jim.
- Yeah?

39:03.201 --> 39:04.202
Oh, Jim.

39:06.162 --> 39:07.835
Here, here, here, here.

39:41.864 --> 39:43.116
What was in the box?

39:54.752 --> 39:55.969
This.

40:19.944 --> 40:22.663
Thank you. I think that's all we'll need.

40:25.324 --> 40:26.667
That's it?

40:27.326 --> 40:28.327
That...

40:28.619 --> 40:29.745
Thank you.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.171
Thank you.

40:41.674 --> 40:43.142
<i>Dear Mom and Dad.</i>

40:45.886 --> 40:49.686
<i>About my leaves, I gave them all away.</i>

40:51.767 --> 40:53.360
<i>It's what you do with gifts.</i>

40:56.230 --> 40:58.107
<i>I gave one to Aunt Brenda</i>

40:59.358 --> 41:01.156
<i>so now she can rock.</i>

41:05.865 --> 41:07.913
<i>I wanted Uncle Bub to have one.</i>

41:10.369 --> 41:11.746
<i>And Miss Crudstaff.</i>

41:13.873 --> 41:18.003
<i>Coach Cal got one.
He said it was my best kick ever.</i>

41:20.004 --> 41:23.304
<i>I gave one to Reggie,
because he really liked them.</i>

41:27.678 --> 41:31.933
<i>I left one for Grandpa Jim
where I know he'll find it.</i>

41:40.274 --> 41:43.244
<i>And Joni, she got two.</i>

41:45.905 --> 41:50.081
<i>And for you guys, here's what I know.</i>

41:52.745 --> 41:54.747
<i>If you came to me and said,</i>

41:55.247 --> 41:57.341
<i>"There are two people in the world</i>

41:57.416 --> 41:59.259
<i>who want you more than anything."</i>

41:59.335 --> 42:00.427
Jim!

42:01.253 --> 42:05.303
<i>"They'll do their best.
They'll make some mistakes."</i>

42:06.425 --> 42:09.144
<i>"And you'll only get them
for a short time."</i>

42:10.805 --> 42:13.775
<i>"But they will love you
more than you can ever imagine. "</i>

42:17.853 --> 42:21.448
<i>"Well, when that's true, I'd say,</i>

42:23.442 --> 42:25.444
<i>so much is possible. "</i>

42:45.297 --> 42:46.389
Hi.

42:47.717 --> 42:48.809
Hi.

42:49.176 --> 42:50.302
Hi.

42:51.345 --> 42:52.437
I'm Cindy.

42:52.847 --> 42:53.973
I'm Jim.

42:58.310 --> 42:59.357
And you can call us...

42:59.437 --> 43:00.939
Whatever you want.

43:02.148 --> 43:03.400
I'm Lily.

43:07.737 --> 43:09.114
You want to come inside?

44:20.976 --> 44:24.230
<i>This gift will last forever</i>

44:24.313 --> 44:27.567
<i>This gift will never let you down</i>

44:27.650 --> 44:31.200
<i>Some things are made from better stuff</i>

44:31.278 --> 44:34.373
<i>This gift is waiting to be found</i>

44:34.448 --> 44:37.748
<i>Your heart's in wide receiving</i>

44:37.827 --> 44:41.252
<i>Been too long buried in the sand</i>

44:41.330 --> 44:44.675
<i>Some things require leaving</i>

44:44.750 --> 44:51.474
<i>This gift will fall right in your hand</i>

44:52.550 --> 44:56.771
<i>Just try to understand</i>

45:00.140 --> 45:05.488
<i>If you long enough</i>

45:07.106 --> 45:11.987
<i>And you don't give up</i>

45:13.821 --> 45:18.952
<i>If you're strong enough</i>

45:20.452 --> 45:25.424
<i>And you don't give up</i>

45:27.376 --> 45:32.132
<i>And you'll be no harbor</i>

45:33.799 --> 45:37.645
<i>To the sorrow</i>

45:40.431 --> 45:41.432
<i>Just let it go</i>

46:22.306 --> 46:25.310
