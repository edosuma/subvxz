00:03.000 --> 00:04.750
(Ryan)
Previously, on Mech-X4 ...

00:04.834 --> 00:06.917
(Mastermind) You know you're
on the ocean floor now.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.959
No one is coming to save you.

00:09.041 --> 00:11.000
-An underwater base?
-That's where Leo has to be.

00:11.083 --> 00:13.750
(Ryan) We have this cool new tech,
and this cool new robot mod.

00:13.834 --> 00:15.083
Let's get Leo.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.750
(Harris)
I made these MECH-Links.

00:20.834 --> 00:24.041
Think of it like a little bit of Mech-X4,
on your wrist.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.291
(Ryan) While I was in Leo's cell,
I... I figured something out.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.750
I know who the guy
behind all of this is!

00:30.834 --> 00:31.959
It's Seth Harper!

00:35.125 --> 00:36.458
It was Harper.

00:36.542 --> 00:39.500
It was Harper behind the monsters
the whole time!

00:39.583 --> 00:42.750
(coughs)
Ryan... (groans)

00:42.834 --> 00:44.917
Take it easy, Leo,
you're not 100 percent yet.

00:45.000 --> 00:45.834
(coughs)

00:45.917 --> 00:47.750
Leo, I have so many questions
about my powers.

00:47.834 --> 00:49.709
And I promise, I'll answer
all of them, but right now,

00:49.792 --> 00:50.959
we have to stop Harper.

00:51.041 --> 00:52.542
-But I...
-Ryan!

00:52.625 --> 00:54.792
There is a giant pocket
of Primorphorous Gel.

00:54.875 --> 00:58.250
It's the key to Harper's... you know,
master plan to destroy the world.

00:58.333 --> 01:01.125
And if he thinks you've drowned
in that underwater base,

01:01.208 --> 01:03.291
he's gonna move fast
to get that gel.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.834
Define fast.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.375
It could be days. It could be minutes.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.500
Whoo! Minutes would be a bummer.

01:09.583 --> 01:12.792
Got it. My questions can wait.
We got work to do.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.875
Let's get down to Harper Futuristics
and put an end to that guy.

01:15.959 --> 01:17.792
We can't.
Even if we take out Harper,

01:17.875 --> 01:19.917
his people will still
carry out his plan.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.375
Then we have to get to the gel
first and destroy it.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.458
And get Harper
to stop dating your mom.

01:25.542 --> 01:28.000
Really? I'm the only one
who thought of that?

01:30.041 --> 01:32.375
So, Leo... where's
this ooze pocket?

01:32.458 --> 01:33.667
Ugh... I don't know.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.375
He keeps all the important stuff
locked up here.

01:36.458 --> 01:40.750
Oh yeah, too bad you can't use
your powers to hack into his brain.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.083
-Ha!
-Huh?

01:42.166 --> 01:45.083
Hack into his brain. Yeah, I...

01:46.333 --> 01:48.000
Let me see in here.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.333
Okay, that's...
Okay. Uh, um...

01:52.417 --> 01:54.041
(Leo muttering)

01:54.125 --> 01:55.792
-I see what you're doing.
-Uh-huh.

01:55.875 --> 01:58.917
That's the part of the robot that boosts
Ryan's powers to connect with Mech-X4.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.458
-Exactly.
-But what are these modifications?

02:01.542 --> 02:06.875
Oh, these are theta-band transceivers,
so you can sync up to Harper's brain.

02:06.959 --> 02:09.500
And create a three-dimensional
memory-scape...

02:09.583 --> 02:11.875
-Yeah.
-...accessible to the technopathic plane!

02:11.959 --> 02:13.083
-Ba-bam!
-Yeah!

02:13.166 --> 02:14.625
-Ooh, yeah, science!
-Science!

02:14.709 --> 02:15.875
(growling)

02:15.959 --> 02:18.792
Wait. So, we put that...

02:18.875 --> 02:20.625
Oh, it's a neurosplicer.

02:20.709 --> 02:23.000
-...on Harper's head.
-Yeah.

02:23.083 --> 02:26.417
We connect to his brain
and then I use my power

02:26.500 --> 02:29.709
to jump into his mind and figure out
where the ooze pocket is.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.417
-Yes!
-Only one tiny problem.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.000
Harper's never gonna
put that thing on.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.959
Well, he doesn't know
that we're onto him.

02:37.041 --> 02:39.667
And he has a huge
product launch tomorrow.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.500
Harper thinks he's our buddy.

02:41.583 --> 02:42.875
I bet we could get tickets.

02:45.291 --> 02:48.917
Who's up for mind-jacking
an evil billionaire genius?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.041
(laughs)
Okay.

02:52.125 --> 02:54.625
Can you guys
bring me back a juice?

02:54.709 --> 02:57.834
(theme music playing)

03:14.959 --> 03:17.458
Hi, I'm Seth Harper.
Bold! Impressive!

03:17.542 --> 03:19.250
Fantastic!
Amazing!

03:19.333 --> 03:21.500
And, yes, I have
a dark secret,

03:21.583 --> 03:22.750
But Harris,
Harris Jr.,

03:22.834 --> 03:25.458
is no less of a genius
'cause he didn't know.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.709
Boom! How was that?

03:28.792 --> 03:32.917
Yeah. Uh, you need
to be more animated.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.083
Have you seen
that guy's hands?

03:34.166 --> 03:36.083
They flop around like a goldfish
out of its bowl.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.583
(Leo laughs)

03:37.667 --> 03:38.792
Okay, now me.

03:38.875 --> 03:40.834
This hologram isn't
for goofing around.

03:40.917 --> 03:42.709
I gotta make sure no one knows
Harper's missing

03:42.792 --> 03:44.542
before the big product
release launch.

03:44.625 --> 03:48.333
I know. All I'm saying is,
I'd be a better Harper than you.

03:48.417 --> 03:50.834
That's impressive work
on the hologram, Harris.

03:50.917 --> 03:53.458
Thanks. I based it out of
your hologram tech

03:53.542 --> 03:55.458
-you used to hide Mech-X3.
-Hmm.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.333
I just hope it's good enough
to fool people.

03:57.417 --> 04:00.500
Well, here is the neurosplicer.

04:00.583 --> 04:02.375
And one more thing.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.875
Ryan will also need this.

04:04.959 --> 04:06.208
What is that?

04:06.291 --> 04:10.041
Well, the neurosplicer
will get Ryan into Harper's brain,

04:10.125 --> 04:12.250
and this, will get him out.

04:16.917 --> 04:21.625
(bass guitar playing riff)

04:24.083 --> 04:27.250
Hey, amigos! You made it!

04:27.333 --> 04:30.166
Couldn't stay away.
Thank you so much for VIP passes.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.166
Oh, look, it means so much
to me that you guys came.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.625
I mean, these things are always
a little bit of a snoozefest,

04:34.709 --> 04:37.917
but havin' people that I actually
wanna share my world with...

04:38.000 --> 04:40.542
man, that just...
makes it all worthwhile.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.375
Um, did you hear?
DJ Live-Rat$z just got here.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.875
-Really? Cool.
-Come on, come on, come on.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.250
Where is she?
I don't see her.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.792
Keep lookin', she's there.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.500
(electronic beeping)

05:04.083 --> 05:06.291
-(Jessica) Mr. Harper?
-Go, go, go.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.709
Have you seen Mr. Harper?
No. Mr. Harper?

05:10.917 --> 05:13.667
Mister... Mr. Harper.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.500
Jessica! You look fantastico!

05:15.583 --> 05:18.542
Not that I would judge you on your looks.
You're also very intelligent, okay!

05:18.625 --> 05:20.083
Are you having
some kind of attack?

05:21.333 --> 05:22.875
-No... No?
-Hmm?

05:22.959 --> 05:24.458
It's time for the presentation.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.625
Oh! Uh, I thought that wasn't for,
like, an hour.

05:28.709 --> 05:29.834
Are you sure you're okay?

05:29.917 --> 05:31.375
Uh, should we get you
checked out?

05:31.458 --> 05:33.625
No, no, no. No, nobody
needs to check anything.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.917
I... I am perfectly believable.
I'm perfectly legal.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.709
I mean, uh... I'm... I'm, uh,
I'm... stupend-errifico!

05:39.792 --> 05:42.291
I'm, uh, amaze-balls!

05:42.375 --> 05:43.500
Ah!

05:44.959 --> 05:46.834
Awesome sauce.
I'm awesome sau...

05:46.917 --> 05:48.834
Later, JJ!

05:48.917 --> 05:51.875
-How was that?
-Terrible!

06:03.333 --> 06:05.667
All right, so we've got
the neurosplicer on him.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.750
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

06:08.834 --> 06:12.542
Ah! Yeah, he won't even know
you're in there. Yeah.

06:12.625 --> 06:15.000
Just, uh...
don't get brain damage.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.917
How would I get
brain damage?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.959
Oh, by staying in Harper's brain for too
long. Did I for... forget to mention that?

06:22.041 --> 06:23.333
I think I would've
remembered that.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.375
-Yeah.
-Okay, well, how do I know

06:25.458 --> 06:26.792
I've been in Harper's brain too long?

06:26.875 --> 06:28.291
Oh, it's easy.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.709
Easy as pie, you just, uh,
gotta look at the remote.

06:30.792 --> 06:33.458
It's like a traffic light. If it's green,

06:33.542 --> 06:36.500
you're okay.
If it's, uh, yellow, or amber, heh,

06:36.583 --> 06:38.083
you're, uh, you're
running out of time,

06:38.166 --> 06:41.291
and if it's red, got to get out of there.

06:41.375 --> 06:44.959
Okay, uh, passing out now,
for a few hours.

06:45.041 --> 06:47.542
Just still wiped from years of prison.

06:47.625 --> 06:48.834
Good night. Okay.

06:50.917 --> 06:52.834
This is a bad idea, dude.

06:52.917 --> 06:54.417
It's the only way to stop Harper.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.500
I'll get in, he won't even notice me,
and then I'll get out.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.917
He won't remember a thing.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.500
(electronic beeps)

07:05.583 --> 07:08.083
- ...the power to hack into his brain.
-(Leo) Hack into his brain.

07:08.166 --> 07:12.583
-(voices calling Ryan)
-Don't get brain damage. (echoing)

07:15.375 --> 07:19.625
(sound distorts, slows)

07:26.250 --> 07:27.417
Whoa.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.625
What are you doing here?

07:40.333 --> 07:43.667
What am... I doing here?

07:44.917 --> 07:46.792
Uh... I, uh...

07:46.875 --> 07:48.792
Well, I wasn't gonna stay
at the symposium

07:48.875 --> 07:50.458
after I heard they expelled you.

07:50.542 --> 07:52.166
(echoing)
Expelled you.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.125
Aah.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.750
Hey, man, all I did
was interrupt a speech

07:56.834 --> 07:59.625
by that dude from the company
that polluted the Bay.

07:59.709 --> 08:04.083
Yeah, and also genetically modified
the dean's ficus plant to eat him.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.333
(echoing) Eat him.

08:05.417 --> 08:08.667
Oh, yeah, that.
I call it the Venus Jerk-Trap.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.250
'Cause he's a jerk, and...

08:10.333 --> 08:15.875
I... It's funny, but... you can't convince
people to be better by bullying them.

08:15.959 --> 08:17.792
Your heart was in the right place, so...

08:17.875 --> 08:20.500
Yeah. And I was right.
(echoing) I was right.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.083
Let me tell you, one day when I have
the power to change things...

08:24.542 --> 08:25.709
it's gonna be different.

08:31.208 --> 08:34.291
All right, Leo. I guess this is it.

08:35.959 --> 08:37.500
Good luck.
(echoing) Good luck.

08:37.583 --> 08:38.750
Yeah, you too, Seth.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.000
(Both) (echoing)
Science.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.834
I think I might've gone too far back
into his memories.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.959
He's still a good guy here.

08:48.041 --> 08:49.333
Ow.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.792
What is that?

08:57.875 --> 09:00.041
-What is that?
-Huh?

09:00.125 --> 09:01.959
Okay, I'm comin' out!

09:02.041 --> 09:03.417
(gasps)

09:03.500 --> 09:05.250
How's your brain?
How many fingers am I holding up?

09:05.333 --> 09:07.834
Five, four, five, three, two, one.
Five, two, one, f...

09:07.917 --> 09:10.583
Knock it off, Dingus!
I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

09:10.667 --> 09:11.667
Okay.

09:13.125 --> 09:16.333
But some weird...
fuzzy thing came right at me.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.542
Maybe there's something wrong
with the neurosplicer.

09:20.625 --> 09:23.291
-I'm getting Harris.
-Harris is busy being Harper out there,

09:23.375 --> 09:25.834
so we can have
the real Harper in here.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.250
I'm goin' back in.

09:39.834 --> 09:42.792
(cheers and applause)

09:45.959 --> 09:48.291
I can do this.
I can do this.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.834
Thank you, everyone.

09:49.917 --> 09:54.542
Today, we're streaming live to more than
a billion people around the planet.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.458
-And we're broadcasting into space...
-Oh, no, it's Mark.

09:57.542 --> 09:59.208
There must be a problem
with the neurosplicer.

09:59.291 --> 10:00.250
I gotta go.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.125
Oh, don't worry,
I got the hand flops nailed.

10:03.208 --> 10:08.417
And now, I'd like to welcome to the stage
Harper Futuristics' fearless leader,

10:08.500 --> 10:10.750
Seth Harper!

10:10.834 --> 10:12.917
(applause and cheers)

10:17.834 --> 10:19.417
Seth Harper!

10:19.500 --> 10:22.250
(cheers, applause)

10:26.667 --> 10:29.208
-(Woman) We're waiting for him.
-(Man) Where is he?

10:29.291 --> 10:31.166
Seth... Harper?

10:31.250 --> 10:34.750
Yeah-yeah-yeah!
Yeah-yeah-yeah! Whoo!

10:34.834 --> 10:38.208
What is up, party poopers?

10:38.291 --> 10:40.458
(cheers, applause)

10:40.542 --> 10:43.875
Heh! Wow! There is like
a lot of you guys!

10:43.959 --> 10:45.500
(phone beeps)

10:45.917 --> 10:47.792
Come on, Harris.

10:52.834 --> 10:54.583
(gasps)

10:58.750 --> 11:00.917
(Ryan) Oh... Whoa.

11:05.542 --> 11:06.917
It's the ooze.

11:08.583 --> 11:11.709
Oh, I cannot wait to get this into my lab.

11:11.792 --> 11:14.709
But there's not enough here
to make a monster.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.291
Whoa. Where did he go?

11:26.709 --> 11:30.125
(voices chattering)

11:37.667 --> 11:39.917
Harper Futuristics?

11:47.041 --> 11:48.500
All right, everyone!

11:48.583 --> 11:49.834
Gather around!

11:49.917 --> 11:51.000
Gather around.

11:53.875 --> 11:57.625
After all these years,
and all your hard work...

11:57.709 --> 12:00.083
Yeah, I'm lookin' at you, Big Dave.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.667
This is it, guys.
Here we go.

12:02.750 --> 12:06.333
Now, nobody get too close.

12:06.417 --> 12:09.583
This thing is like amazingly dangerous.

12:24.208 --> 12:28.375
(growling)

12:32.959 --> 12:36.083
Whoa! We should've built a bigger lab.

12:36.166 --> 12:39.291
(roaring)

12:39.375 --> 12:40.583
(screaming)

12:40.667 --> 12:42.834
(electronic buzzing)

12:46.500 --> 12:48.250
-What is that thing?
-I don't know.

12:48.333 --> 12:51.834
Okay! Okay, good...
good first test, everyone.

12:51.917 --> 12:55.375
Super good. Uh, let's...
let's revert that back to gel form,

12:55.458 --> 12:57.500
and see if we can
figure out a way to make it,

12:57.583 --> 13:00.625
oh, I don't know,
uh, not try and eat me!

13:00.709 --> 13:01.834
Dave?

13:02.917 --> 13:04.458
I'm gonna need more of that gel.

13:04.542 --> 13:08.208
Somebody get me Grey on the line.
(echoing) On the line.

13:10.208 --> 13:11.500
Principal Grey?

13:16.125 --> 13:18.375
(school bell ringing)

13:21.166 --> 13:23.834
(Mastermind)
So, you understand your orders?

13:23.917 --> 13:26.917
But I hate children.

13:28.166 --> 13:31.041
Hmm. Why am I here?

13:31.125 --> 13:34.333
Because there's something
of great value under the school

13:34.417 --> 13:36.417
I need you to protect it.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.917
When the time is right,
I will destroy the school

13:39.000 --> 13:41.041
and harvest it.

13:41.125 --> 13:44.041
The giant pocket of ooze
is under the school?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.208
Ooze.

13:48.917 --> 13:50.417
Why'd you call me?

13:50.500 --> 13:52.667
(Mark) Something in Harper's brain
came after Ryan.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.750
Dude, your remote
just turned yellow.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.917
You got to get
out of there!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.458
(Harris)
He can't hear us.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.333
-(grunting)
-Ryan!

14:21.333 --> 14:23.625
Looking for this?

14:23.709 --> 14:28.000
Did you really think that I wouldn't be
aware of a stranger in my head?

14:29.041 --> 14:32.458
My mind, Ryan. My rules.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.917
(Harper)
My mind, Ryan. My rules.

14:42.000 --> 14:42.959
What the...?

14:43.041 --> 14:45.083
Beautiful, isn't it?

14:45.166 --> 14:47.500
My remote.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.250
Smell that air.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.291
Not a hint of pollution,
you know why?

14:54.417 --> 14:58.542
Because I had to wipe the world
clean, so that, years later...

15:01.750 --> 15:03.542
it'll look like this.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.750
Free of damage caused by humans.
I love it here!

15:06.834 --> 15:10.333
I am making a paradise
for the worthy.

15:10.417 --> 15:14.125
The only question is,
will you be a part of it?

15:15.625 --> 15:17.625
Hey, now, that was, like,
a trick question,

15:17.709 --> 15:20.542
'cause skateboarding and snowboarding
are, like, both, like,

15:20.625 --> 15:24.959
the same amount of cool,
and you can't judge one over the other.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.500
(Woman)
Yeah, show us the product!

15:26.583 --> 15:30.125
Right! Yes, yes, you wanna know
what's under there.

15:30.208 --> 15:35.208
I, Seth Harper, not a kid,
pretending to be Seth Harper,

15:35.291 --> 15:36.583
'cause that...
that'd be weird...

15:36.667 --> 15:41.542
uh, present to you,
the brand-new...

15:41.625 --> 15:43.542
letter H?

15:43.625 --> 15:45.750
(scattered applause)

15:45.834 --> 15:48.458
It's an H. Heh...

15:48.542 --> 15:54.250
So... what is it?
What is it? What is it?

15:54.333 --> 15:58.583
Uh... a Wi-Fi-enabled...
gaming system.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.709
Monitor your pets.
Dispensify... snacks.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.458
-Does magic!
-(murmuring)

16:05.542 --> 16:07.417
None of this is in the script!

16:07.500 --> 16:11.208
The... Harp Quad HD.

16:13.125 --> 16:18.291
Uh-oh. Uh, everyone in the
audience gets... a thousand dollars!

16:18.375 --> 16:20.542
-(applauding)
-And... a puppy.

16:20.625 --> 16:23.166
(cheers, applause)

16:23.250 --> 16:24.709
Peace y'all!

16:31.709 --> 16:34.375
(Harper)
So! What's it gonna be?

16:34.458 --> 16:38.667
Will you be a part of my utopia?

16:38.750 --> 16:40.542
By letting you wipe out
everyone on Earth?

16:40.625 --> 16:41.959
If our minds
really are connected,

16:42.041 --> 16:43.500
then you already know
my answer!

16:43.583 --> 16:45.291
(grunts)

16:47.333 --> 16:48.333
Okay, that's not cool.

16:48.417 --> 16:50.625
Hey, you can't
make an omelet without

16:50.709 --> 16:52.208
breakin' a few necks.

16:52.291 --> 16:53.625
I don't think
that's the expression.

16:53.709 --> 16:54.625
Oh, isn't it?

16:54.709 --> 16:55.959
Ah, well.

17:03.166 --> 17:04.917
Get him out.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.375
Ryan? Ryan!

17:07.458 --> 17:08.417
(Harris) It's not working!

17:08.500 --> 17:09.709
His brain's gonna get fried.

17:09.792 --> 17:10.834
I'm gettin' that thing off.

17:10.917 --> 17:12.875
While Ryan's still connected?

17:12.959 --> 17:14.458
That could kill him!

17:16.333 --> 17:19.917
You guys ever give anybody the full
details of anything before you do it?

17:40.834 --> 17:43.417
-Hey, Ry Guy.
-Don't call me that!

17:43.500 --> 17:45.417
Only my friends
and my mom call me that.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.542
Ooh, snap.

17:47.625 --> 17:52.333
I see, so, if I'm not
your friend, then...

17:52.417 --> 17:55.458
well, you know
what I do to my enemies.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.166
You messed with the wrong mind.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.709
That is made from recycled paper,
by the way.

19:07.792 --> 19:09.375
How are you doing this?

19:09.458 --> 19:13.458
In the mind, I can do anything, Ryan.

19:15.417 --> 19:16.917
Maybe I can, too.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.583
I'm done playing.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.792
It's red. You gotta cut the link.

19:43.792 --> 19:46.000
I really don't wanna do this.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.208
You actually thought
that you could beat me?

19:53.375 --> 19:54.625
In my mind?

20:00.625 --> 20:02.166
(shouting)

20:16.375 --> 20:18.875
Ryan? You okay?

20:18.959 --> 20:20.083
Yeah.

20:20.166 --> 20:22.583
Harper got control
a little bit there, but...

20:22.667 --> 20:24.500
I got everything I needed.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.875
-(Man) Hey, is someone in there?
-Out the back, out the back!

20:27.959 --> 20:30.667
(Man)
This area is off-limits!

20:30.750 --> 20:34.375
(groans)

20:35.625 --> 20:36.750
Sir?

20:36.834 --> 20:39.208
Whoa, what the...?

20:39.291 --> 20:40.750
Where am I?

20:40.834 --> 20:42.667
I'm not surprised you're exhausted.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.458
You were fantastic out there.

20:44.542 --> 20:46.834
Really? Well, yeah, of course,
you know me.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.542
I just sort of like,
get in the zone out there.

20:48.625 --> 20:53.208
I kind of lose track of things.
So, what happened?

20:53.291 --> 20:56.125
-What exactly happened in his mind?
-I'll explain later.

20:56.208 --> 20:59.417
The important thing is,
I know where the ooze is.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.291
It's under the school.

21:01.375 --> 21:03.375
And we gotta get to it
before Harper does.

21:03.458 --> 21:04.583
(shrieks)

21:04.667 --> 21:06.208
Before Harper does what?

21:08.709 --> 21:09.792
(laughs)

21:11.041 --> 21:12.375
Aah! Just kidding, guys.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.542
Haha. What'd I miss?

21:14.625 --> 21:17.291
Nothing. Just the end of the world.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.834
-(clamoring)
-(Man) Hey, they he is!

21:20.917 --> 21:22.000
Harper!

21:24.667 --> 21:26.625
Hey, hey, guys, guys.

21:26.709 --> 21:29.333
Thank you so much for coming.

21:29.417 --> 21:31.458
Yeah. Yeah, it was, uh,
it was amazing.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.667
You know, it's weird,
I almost don't even remember

21:33.750 --> 21:35.166
doing the presentation.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.500
-Must've been the adrenaline.
-The body is a mystery.

21:37.583 --> 21:40.208
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

21:40.291 --> 21:41.542
See you around.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.500
I'll see you guys.

21:43.583 --> 21:45.166
I'll see you real soon.

21:54.208 --> 21:55.208
Morris.

21:56.667 --> 21:59.291
I know who the pilots are.

21:59.375 --> 22:01.333
And I know what they're
gonna do next.

22:04.041 --> 22:07.250
(theme music playing)

22:28.709 --> 22:29.959
(barking)
