00:15.167 --> 00:17.133
* When the Sheriff John Brown
come for you? *

00:17.167 --> 00:18.667
-Officer: You better stop!

00:18.700 --> 00:20.733
(grunts, growls)

-* Bad boys, bad boys *

"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:40.700
in a court of law.

00:42.467 --> 00:45.500
-I think working
in the city of Des Moines
is actually fantastic.

00:45.533 --> 00:47.833
Your good days out here
are some of the best days

00:47.867 --> 00:50.000
you'll ever have in your life,
and when it's a bad day out here

00:50.033 --> 00:52.100
it's probably the worst days
you're gonna have in your life.

00:52.133 --> 00:53.467
So, you gotta be ready.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.667
There's very little
middle ground
in law enforcement.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.500
And if you want to come out
and see something different

00:58.533 --> 01:00.633
all day long,
every day of your life,

01:00.667 --> 01:02.333
this is the place to be.

01:02.367 --> 01:05.067
We've been asked to go
assist a couple of officers

01:05.067 --> 01:07.533
on an escaped felon,

01:07.567 --> 01:10.767
and the information
we've received is that

01:10.800 --> 01:13.233
he's possibly armed
and he definitely

01:13.267 --> 01:15.833
doesn't like the police
and probably won't be

01:15.867 --> 01:17.933
all that cooperative,
so on these, it's probably

01:17.967 --> 01:20.667
always better to have
a few more bodies
than a few less.

01:21.867 --> 01:23.267
-(car door opens)

01:23.300 --> 01:25.767
-All right,
right in the middle.

01:29.767 --> 01:30.967
-Did you catch his name?

01:31.067 --> 01:32.633
-David.
-Okay.

01:34.167 --> 01:35.833
-I just know he's there.

01:35.867 --> 01:38.300
-David's in there?
Where's he at?

01:38.333 --> 01:39.733
-Where in there?
I don't know.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.533
-Where's he at?
-I don't know.
I ain't been in there.

01:41.567 --> 01:42.967
-Is it your house?
-Yeah.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.533
-Okay. Can we go in?

01:46.933 --> 01:48.633
-Do they know
there's two kids in there?

01:48.667 --> 01:50.500
-Hey, there's two kids in there!

01:50.533 --> 01:52.267
-They shut the door.
-Yeah.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.333
He just shut that door
on us right there.

01:54.367 --> 01:55.700
Is there a back door?

01:58.233 --> 01:59.700
Watch that side.

02:02.067 --> 02:03.100
-(dog barking)

02:03.133 --> 02:04.667
-Radio:
32 Adam.

02:05.867 --> 02:09.300
-David? David!

02:09.333 --> 02:11.600
David, Des Moines Police.
Put your hands above your head.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.600
-(woman shouts)
-David, open the door

02:13.633 --> 02:15.300
and come out
with your hands up!

02:15.333 --> 02:16.567
-(dog barks)

02:16.600 --> 02:18.400
-David!
-Woman: Door!

02:18.433 --> 02:19.767
-David, open the door!

02:19.800 --> 02:21.067
-Hey, boy, come here!

02:21.067 --> 02:22.733
-Come on!
-Don't come in here, man!

02:22.767 --> 02:25.267
-David, we're gonna
kick the door.
-Don't do that!

02:25.300 --> 02:27.433
-You've got a warrant, David.
It's time to come out.

02:27.467 --> 02:29.233
-No, Officer! You don't want
to come in here, man!

02:29.267 --> 02:31.567
-David, you're comin' out!

02:31.600 --> 02:33.267
We're not goin' anywhere!

02:33.300 --> 02:34.600
Do it right!

02:34.633 --> 02:37.433
-Don't come in here!
I don't want to die yet!

02:37.467 --> 02:39.367
-David, come out
and put your hands up!

02:39.400 --> 02:41.767
-No!
-David, if you don't
put your hands up,

02:41.800 --> 02:43.367
we're gonna end up
coming through that door,

02:43.400 --> 02:44.533
and that's not
what you want.

02:44.567 --> 02:45.967
-Well, you're right about that!

02:46.067 --> 02:47.700
-Listen!
-I can end this now!

02:47.733 --> 02:50.433
-What?
-Gonna put a bullet
in my head! Just take it off!

02:50.467 --> 02:52.067
-David, don't do that.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.633
-(shouting)
-Put down your gun, David.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.400
-Don't wanna die!
-David!

02:55.433 --> 02:57.067
All you gotta do
is get processed.

02:57.067 --> 02:58.733
You're gonna be done.
That's all it is, brother.

02:58.767 --> 03:00.267
You're not gonna die.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.700
Nobody dies today.

03:01.733 --> 03:03.633
Nobody gets hurt, man.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.433
That's not what
we're here for.

03:05.467 --> 03:06.700
-And I'm thirsty!

03:06.733 --> 03:09.067
And I want a cigarette!
That's all I want!

03:09.100 --> 03:11.533
-Okay, if you come out,
I'll get you a smoke, man.

03:11.567 --> 03:15.100
-(shouting)
-No, I'll get you smokes
if you come out, brother.

03:15.133 --> 03:16.467
Watch that door.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.067
-Okay.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.600
-(house door opens)
-Hey, can you talk him
into giving up?

03:21.667 --> 03:23.400
Ma'am! Grandma, come in here.

03:23.433 --> 03:25.700
Talk to him
through the door.
-Hey, just come out, man.

03:25.733 --> 03:27.333
-David?

03:27.367 --> 03:29.733
Come on out for Grandma.

03:29.767 --> 03:31.767
-David, listen to your Grandma.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.200
-Come on!
I want you still alive.

03:34.233 --> 03:35.833
I don't want you dead.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.200
-Just go away.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.267
-Come on, David, please!

03:40.533 --> 03:42.967
-David, here's the deal,
the longer this goes,

03:43.067 --> 03:44.667
the more dangerous it gets.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.267
I don't want anybody hurt.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.633
Get the shield.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.300
It's in the bed trunk
of my car, Marshal.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.833
-Water, a cigarette,
and to have it... (indistinct)

03:51.867 --> 03:54.067
-What'd you say?
Water and a cigarette?

03:54.100 --> 03:55.633
-Can I have a cigarette
and a glass of water?

03:55.667 --> 03:57.067
-Cool. I'll get you that.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.067
Get me a water.
Get me a glass of water.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.467
-A big glass of water.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.833
-We're gettin' it.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.167
Somebody cover me.

04:07.433 --> 04:09.933
I'm gonna put your smokes--
Your water is right there.

04:09.967 --> 04:11.067
-(David muttering)

04:11.100 --> 04:13.233
I want the shield.
I want the shield.

04:16.833 --> 04:18.100
Ready?

04:18.133 --> 04:19.467
-Marshal, be ready.

04:22.133 --> 04:25.367
-Okay. One, two, three.
-Careful with the officer
in front of you.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.067
-Kick it.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.533
-(door opens)
-(grunting)

04:28.567 --> 04:30.100
-Get on the ground!
-Get on the ground!

04:30.133 --> 04:32.133
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

04:32.167 --> 04:35.067
Get on the ground!
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

04:35.100 --> 04:37.300
-Aah! I can't move!
-Move your hands!

04:37.333 --> 04:39.067
Move your hands up
behind your back!

04:39.067 --> 04:41.733
Put your hands behind your back!

04:41.767 --> 04:44.300
-(sobbing)

04:44.333 --> 04:46.133
-502 David,
we're good here.

04:46.167 --> 04:47.700
-I'm in so much trouble.

04:47.733 --> 04:48.933
-You okay in here?
-Yup.

04:48.967 --> 04:50.233
-I want him out
of the room.
-Okay.

04:50.267 --> 04:52.667
-Let's go.
-(sobbing)

04:55.933 --> 04:58.633
Oh, my glasses.
Please don't step on 'em.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.767
-Okay, we'll pick 'em up.
Pick up his glasses for him.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.533
-(panting)
Can I at least get water?

05:02.567 --> 05:04.600
-Okay, we're gonna
fix him right here.

05:04.633 --> 05:07.067
-Marshal, Rob, see if you can
find that glass of water.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.533
-I got bottled waters
in the house.

05:08.567 --> 05:09.833
-Okay, we'll get you some.

05:09.867 --> 05:11.133
We'll watch ya.

05:11.167 --> 05:12.367
We'll watch ya.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.100
Everything's fine.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.367
Everything's fine.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.267
-I got your glasses,
all right, bud?

05:17.300 --> 05:18.700
-(exhales)
-Good?

05:18.733 --> 05:19.967
-Slow down, brother.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.967
Will somebody get my man David
a drink of water, please?

05:22.067 --> 05:24.800
-Hey, hey, your water
right there.

05:24.833 --> 05:26.633
-Somebody find me a cigarette.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.067
We'll get you a smoke.

05:28.067 --> 05:29.900
We're gonna sit you down
so you can chill, brother.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.100
All right?
'Cause we're chill now.

05:36.133 --> 05:38.367
Right? We're Fonzie now.
Right? We're cool.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.700
We're cool, brother.

05:39.733 --> 05:41.333
Breathe. Right there.

05:41.367 --> 05:42.733
Right there. Breathe.

05:42.767 --> 05:45.600
-Cigarette.
-Brother, did you think
we were going away, man?

05:45.633 --> 05:47.067
-I don't know.
I just didn't know.

05:47.067 --> 05:49.600
-Okay.
-(mumbling)

05:49.633 --> 05:51.667
-Okay. You know, man,
I didn't want to hurt you,

05:51.700 --> 05:53.967
but you freaked me out,
brother, when you started
talking about a gun.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.833
-(mumbling)

05:55.867 --> 05:57.633
-What'd you guys find?

05:57.667 --> 05:58.967
-This is the one
I thought was real

05:59.067 --> 06:00.700
when I first picked it up.
It's a CO2.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.400
-It sure looks real.
Tell you what,

06:03.433 --> 06:05.167
if he come out that door
with that in his hand,

06:05.200 --> 06:07.600
this probably would have gone
a whole different direction,
wouldn't it?

06:07.633 --> 06:09.467
-Exactly.
-Man, I'm glad it didn't.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.767
I'm just glad it didn't.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.467
There was no reason
for that today.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.633
What was your warrant for?

06:13.667 --> 06:14.867
What was your
original charge, brah?

06:14.900 --> 06:15.967
A burglary?

06:16.067 --> 06:18.433
-No, a dirty UA.
-A dirty UA on your parole?

06:18.467 --> 06:19.900
-Yeah.
-When did you drop that, bud?

06:19.933 --> 06:21.800
-It didn't drop
'cause I didn't go in to drop.

06:21.833 --> 06:22.933
-You didn't go in to drop?

06:22.967 --> 06:24.867
Did you know they would
come looking for ya?

06:24.900 --> 06:26.733
How long have you been
on parole, brah?

06:26.767 --> 06:28.100
-Five or six years.

06:28.133 --> 06:29.500
-How long did you have left?

06:29.533 --> 06:31.600
-Just had three more.
-Three more?

06:31.633 --> 06:33.833
Man, let me ask you this.
Not that it matters to me.

06:33.867 --> 06:35.567
Would that UA been dirty?

06:35.600 --> 06:38.200
-For weed, yeah.
-For weed? Not methamphetamine?

06:38.233 --> 06:39.967
-Well, it is now.
-It is now?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.600
When did you get high this week?

06:41.633 --> 06:43.767
'Cause I know you're
a little high right now maybe.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.200
-Well, I'm comin' down...
-You're comin' down?

06:46.233 --> 06:47.300
Yeah? Okay.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.600
When did you last
get high, brother?

06:48.633 --> 06:50.700
-Last night.
-Last night?

06:50.733 --> 06:53.533
All right, and you just
wandered the neighborhood
or did you just stay at home?

06:53.567 --> 06:56.067
-I just, I got tired,
and got me something
and came home.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.833
-Okay. This will help you, man.

06:57.867 --> 06:59.200
Maybe clean you up.

06:59.233 --> 07:01.833
All right. You good to go?
We okay?

07:01.867 --> 07:03.067
-Yeah.
-All right, buddy.

07:03.067 --> 07:04.633
Swing yourself in.
You're a nice guy.

07:08.633 --> 07:09.900
Wow.

07:09.933 --> 07:11.500
That's not what I expected
on a Monday.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.400
That freaked me out. Heh.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.667
-It seems like drug use
is kind of a common theme.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.667
Just about every car thief
has a drug habit

07:22.700 --> 07:26.067
whether they're stealing
to support their drug habit

07:26.067 --> 07:28.567
or the thrill
of stealing the car

07:28.600 --> 07:30.367
kind of goes
with their drug habit.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.700
I'm not sure what causes it.

07:31.733 --> 07:34.633
I just know that we see it
on almost every...

07:34.667 --> 07:37.533
every, uh, car we deal with.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.867
-We're gonna stop this Honda
with no plates.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.067
Silver Civic with 1, no plates.

07:46.267 --> 07:47.767
-(siren wails)

07:58.800 --> 08:00.133
-(door opens)

08:00.167 --> 08:01.633
-How you doing?

08:01.667 --> 08:03.867
Do you have ID on you?

08:03.900 --> 08:05.833
Okay, is this your car?

08:07.733 --> 08:09.233
Friend's car?
Okay. All right.

08:09.267 --> 08:11.467
Do you... do you have
a driver's license?

08:11.500 --> 08:13.833
-I don't have
a driver's license.

08:13.867 --> 08:16.533
-Okay. Why don't you give
my information to my partner?

08:16.567 --> 08:18.067
Do you have a key
to this vehicle?

08:18.067 --> 08:20.067
-What's your name?
Do you have a key to the car?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.933
Is there a key in the car?
-Yeah.

08:21.967 --> 08:23.900
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:23.933 --> 08:25.700
-What is all this?
-Do you have your ID?

08:25.733 --> 08:27.767
-Um, I don't.
I was gonna go
to the welfare office.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.067
-Take your glasses off
while you're talking.
What's your name?

08:30.100 --> 08:31.700
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer what?

08:31.733 --> 08:33.167
What?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.733
I thought you said "To-ma-to."

08:34.767 --> 08:36.700
-Oh, no.
-I was like, "Huh,
that's very formal."

08:36.733 --> 08:39.200
-Yes.
-All right, Jennifer,
what's your date of birth?

08:40.500 --> 08:41.533
'85? Whose car?

08:41.567 --> 08:43.067
-It's my friend's.
-Your friend?

08:43.067 --> 08:44.400
Do you have paperwork
for the car?

08:44.433 --> 08:47.100
-Uh...
-Do you want to check
the glove-box for paperwork?

08:47.133 --> 08:49.567
You're driving a car
that has paper plates on it.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.200
Okay? That's a California
vehicle code violation.

08:52.233 --> 08:53.433
You gotta have plates.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.900
If you don't,
we can stop you
to research then.

08:54.933 --> 08:57.133
You understand that?

08:57.167 --> 08:58.900
She's shaking.
I won't be surprised

08:58.933 --> 09:02.567
if this is stolen
right now.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.067
-(computer beeps)
-Yup.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.633
Yeah, 'firmed.
We're detaining the driver now.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.600
-Hey, do me a favor.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.467
Just hop out real quick
so I can talk to you.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.133
Come over here.

09:19.067 --> 09:20.300
Come over here.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.967
Put your hands
on top of your head.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.767
-Okay, but what--
-Put your hands
on top of your head.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.067
This is a stolen car.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.100
-No, it's not.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.867
-Okay, well,
it's showing stolen.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.667
-It's what?
-It's showing stolen.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.067
-How?

09:32.067 --> 09:33.800
-We can talk about that.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.100
-(car beeping)
-Do a little search.

09:37.133 --> 09:40.800
Syringes, counterfeit 20s...

09:40.833 --> 09:46.700
foil, which is generally used
for smoking heroin off of it.

09:46.733 --> 09:49.533
She's driving it
with a whole handful
of shaved keys in the ignition.

09:49.567 --> 09:51.367
-(car starts, beeps)

09:51.400 --> 09:52.500
-It's broken.

09:52.533 --> 09:54.733
It won't go all the way
back to "off" though

09:54.767 --> 09:57.400
because it's been
torqued over too hard.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.267
-Have you been arrested before?
-Yeah. I just--

09:59.300 --> 10:00.967
-For what?
-I borrowed my friend's car

10:01.000 --> 10:03.033
like two weeks ago.
-Hold on. Relax.

10:03.067 --> 10:05.333
-It was on the--
around the fifth.

10:05.367 --> 10:06.567
And I said,
"Can I borrow your car

10:06.600 --> 10:08.400
for just a minute
to run to the store?"

10:08.433 --> 10:10.833
-You're talking about this car?
-No, I'm talking about
this happened recently.

10:10.867 --> 10:12.767
That's why I'm feeling--
I'm feeling really--

10:12.800 --> 10:15.000
-Have you been arrested before
for driving a stolen car?

10:15.033 --> 10:17.267
-Yeah, and I'm mad about that

10:17.300 --> 10:19.367
because they didn't
tell me it was.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.000
-Okay. All right.
-It's not fair

10:21.033 --> 10:22.600
'cause these people
are not my friends.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.800
-Well, just relax.
I'll talk to you a little bit
more about this, okay?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.100
So you didn't know
this car was stolen?

10:26.133 --> 10:27.967
-No.
-Okay. You didn't steal the car?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.600
-No.
-Okay.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.600
-Her story is
that some guy told her

10:31.633 --> 10:33.567
to get in
and drive the car.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.167
But she's driving it
with like five shaved keys,

10:36.200 --> 10:37.900
the ignition's broken
and won't shut off,

10:37.933 --> 10:39.267
doesn't know the name
of the owner,

10:39.300 --> 10:41.467
the plate's stuffed down
next to her leg in plain view,

10:41.500 --> 10:43.633
yet wants to claim that
she didn't know it was stolen.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.667
-Cha-ching.
-Going to jail.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.100
-Have a seat.
Watch your head.

10:47.133 --> 10:50.300
-Please, can I speak
to that other officer, please?

10:50.333 --> 10:52.367
-Yup. Kick your feet in.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.233
-You always gotta be careful.

10:55.267 --> 10:58.400
Pretty common, always lots
of rigs in the car.

10:58.433 --> 11:00.233
Really dangerous for us.

11:00.267 --> 11:02.100
We always try to take them
out of the victim's car

11:02.133 --> 11:05.500
and dispose of 'em
so no one gets stuck.

11:05.533 --> 11:08.167
It's either heroin
or methamphetamine.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.133
-Gonna try calling the victim.

11:11.433 --> 11:12.900
Hey, Gregorio?

11:12.933 --> 11:16.200
-Yeah?
-This is Detective Lynn
with the Sheriff's Department.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.467
-Oh, yeah... (indistinct).

11:18.500 --> 11:20.533
Did you catch my car or what?

11:20.567 --> 11:22.067
-I have your car, yeah.

11:22.067 --> 11:23.900
-(speaking indistinctly)

11:23.933 --> 11:26.367
-It looks good, buddy.
Can you come get it?

11:26.400 --> 11:27.700
-(speaking indistinctly)

11:27.733 --> 11:29.467
-Yup. My pleasure. Bye.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.700
All right. I gotta
text him the address.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.333
-You knew the car was hot.
-In the back of my mind.

11:35.367 --> 11:37.633
-Look at me.
In the back of your mind,
you knew the car was hot.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.400
-In the back of my mind,
and that's why I asked him
for an explanation.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.867
-My point is,
when you got in that car,

11:42.900 --> 11:45.200
you were nervous
'cause you thought
the car might have been stolen.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.533
Correct?

11:46.567 --> 11:48.500
-Yeah. I made a bad judgment
error by even saying, "Okay."

11:48.533 --> 11:49.867
-That's what
I wanted you to say.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.433
-I was stupid.
-You made a mistake.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.900
You made a bad judgment
and hopefully you can
learn from this, yes?

11:53.933 --> 11:55.267
-(mumbles)
-Okay?

11:55.300 --> 11:56.833
-Yes.
-So, I'm not doing you
for all that other crap

11:56.867 --> 11:59.467
inside the car,
I might do you for
the stealing the car.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.967
But you're driving a stolen car

12:01.067 --> 12:03.233
and I think you're smart
enough to know that.

12:03.267 --> 12:04.600
All right?

12:04.633 --> 12:06.933
-Do I have to go to jail today?
-You gotta go to jail today.

12:06.967 --> 12:09.367
You gotta go to jail, okay?

12:09.400 --> 12:11.067
Hopefully next time
we see each other,

12:11.067 --> 12:12.333
it won't be
the same way.

12:12.367 --> 12:13.800
-Please, no.
-Okay, have a seat back there.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.633
I took care of you
on some stuff. Have a seat.

12:15.667 --> 12:16.933
-Can you hand me
my purse, please?

12:16.967 --> 12:18.400
-Okay. We'll take care of you.
Just relax.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.667
-I didn't know. I didn't...

12:22.700 --> 12:24.400
-Hi. Gregorio.
-Tom.

12:24.433 --> 12:25.467
Nice to meet you.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
You wanna come look
at the car with me?

12:27.533 --> 12:29.600
-Yeah.
-It looks, I mean,
there's some...

12:29.633 --> 12:31.700
maybe some paint on it,
but otherwise, it looks
pretty good.

12:31.733 --> 12:32.967
Just be careful.

12:33.067 --> 12:35.067
There's gonna be stuff
inside it that's not yours.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.900
You can go through it
and then whatever is not yours,

12:37.933 --> 12:39.433
you can just toss it.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.633
-Yeah.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.100
-Is the stereo still there?

12:42.133 --> 12:44.100
-Yeah, it's there.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.067
-We're gonna give him
a steering wheel Club.

12:46.100 --> 12:49.167
Some guys, their car is
gonna get stolen repeatedly,

12:49.200 --> 12:50.467
and so I hate that.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.133
I hate recovering
the same car twice.

12:52.167 --> 12:55.100
So, if I can,
we try and get

12:55.133 --> 12:57.233
people the Club
and tell them how to use it,

12:57.267 --> 12:58.600
and hopefully they do.

12:58.633 --> 13:00.900
We actually don't get too many
where the car was equipped

13:00.933 --> 13:03.533
with a Club
and it was still stolen.

13:03.567 --> 13:06.533
We have a bunch leftover
from a previous purchase,

13:06.567 --> 13:08.467
so we try to get 'em
to guys who...

13:08.500 --> 13:10.433
I mean...

13:10.467 --> 13:12.367
his car is gonna
get stolen again

13:12.400 --> 13:15.133
if he just leaves it
the way it is.

13:15.167 --> 13:16.300
Do you have one of these?

13:16.333 --> 13:17.800
-Yeah, how much?

13:17.833 --> 13:20.233
-No, no, it's for you.
-Okay. Oh, thank you.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.800
-Just don't let your car
get stolen again.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.233
-Thank you very much.

13:23.267 --> 13:24.533
-Yeah.
-Use that.

13:24.567 --> 13:26.667
'Cause this, this is gonna
be easy to steal right now.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.167
-I know. Okay.
-Okay?

13:28.200 --> 13:30.533
-Thank you very much, my friend.
-All right? Take care
of yourself.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.233
So, I think
we're done here, bud.

13:32.267 --> 13:34.067
-Yup.
-That was a good takedown.

13:34.067 --> 13:36.933
-We got him his car back.
He's happy with that, so...

13:36.967 --> 13:38.700
-Yeah. And she,
this is the second time

13:38.733 --> 13:40.133
that she's been pinched
on this deal,

13:40.167 --> 13:41.600
so she'll hopefully learn
from this one.

13:41.633 --> 13:42.933
-We'll see.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.767
-I've been in Green Bay
for about a year and a half.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.700
Prior to that,
I was a police officer

13:50.733 --> 13:53.267
in the city of Algoma
for 14 years

13:53.300 --> 13:55.300
Algoma's a very
small department

13:55.333 --> 13:56.533
and there'd only be
a couple cars

13:56.567 --> 13:58.667
out on the street
versus in Green Bay,

13:58.700 --> 14:01.500
where it's so busy, your shift,
it just goes so fast.

14:01.533 --> 14:04.600
Right now we're en route
to a disturbance

14:04.633 --> 14:07.367
over a loose dog.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.867
The individual that has the dog

14:08.900 --> 14:11.267
is refusing to give it back
to their owner.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.433
-(woman speaking Spanish)

14:15.967 --> 14:18.167
-Ma'am? What's going on? Ma'am?

14:18.200 --> 14:19.900
-I don't know
what she told in English.

14:19.933 --> 14:21.500
Me no understand
too much English.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.767
Me nothing for (bleep).

14:23.800 --> 14:25.067
-Woman:
The dog got hit by a car.

14:25.067 --> 14:26.700
-It got hit by a car?
-Okay.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.667
-When did that happen?
-Just recently.
In the last five minutes.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.767
-So just now.
-This was just recent.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.767
We were driving by
from the grocery store--
-It's problem.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.067
My dog, every time, my dog
go outside and going, going.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.700
-Yes, but this time,
he got hit by a car

14:38.733 --> 14:41.300
and you picked him up
off the road and you shook him.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.333
You have hurt him worse.
He's hurt.

14:43.367 --> 14:47.667
-(speaking Spanish)
-(girl translating)

14:47.700 --> 14:49.567
-(bleep)! (bleep)!

14:49.600 --> 14:51.067
-You shook your dog.

14:51.067 --> 14:53.367
-No, she take every time.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.167
-Okay--
-You American people!

14:55.200 --> 14:56.867
Me no understand English.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.933
She understand English.
-Okay, hang on--

14:58.967 --> 15:00.167
-Mommy, ya. Mommy.
-Hey, hey...

15:00.200 --> 15:02.200
-Ah, bull (bleep).
(bleep) her.

15:02.233 --> 15:03.533
-Hey, stop.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.433
-(speaking Spanish)
No, give me my dog.
-Mommy, stop!

15:05.467 --> 15:07.533
-Stop! Now! Stop!

15:07.567 --> 15:08.833
-Yeah.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.067
-Okay, you American too.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.467
-Mommy, ya!
-Mommy, ya!

15:11.500 --> 15:12.800
-Don't even go there.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.567
-(both speaking Spanish)

15:15.600 --> 15:17.100
-Do you understand English?
-Yes.

15:17.133 --> 15:20.633
-Okay. Can you tell your mom
that your dog was hit by a car?

15:20.667 --> 15:21.767
Does your mom know that?

15:21.800 --> 15:24.067
-Yeah.
-(translating)

15:25.767 --> 15:28.067
-Sí.
-And did you see
your dog get hit?

15:28.100 --> 15:29.400
-Oh, no.
-No? Okay.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.633
-No. I no see.
Nobody see that.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.567
-Oh, okay.
-We didn't see it.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.333
-I don't know for what
the girl for me.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.233
Too much (bleep).

15:37.267 --> 15:38.900
-He comes home,
but when people are chasing him,

15:38.933 --> 15:40.400
he doesn't like
when people chase him.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.833
-Me understand that.
-Hang on.

15:41.867 --> 15:43.700
I'm gonna talk
with the other officer, okay?

15:43.733 --> 15:44.833
So what do we have?

15:44.867 --> 15:46.400
-We're gonna have
Animal Control come over

15:46.433 --> 15:49.333
take the dog to the vet,
make sure the dog's
not severely injured.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.067
Apparently it was
hit by a car.
-Yup.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.833
-And go from there.
Maybe a citation

15:53.867 --> 15:55.400
for animal running at-large.

15:55.433 --> 15:56.800
-But what she's saying,

15:56.833 --> 15:58.467
she didn't know
the dog was hit.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.367
-She knew that
the dog was hit.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.800
We told her immediately.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.167
-She doesn't understand English.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.167
-She does. I just had-- I've had
a full conversation with her

16:05.200 --> 16:06.900
several times
about her dogs

16:06.933 --> 16:09.833
running out
in the middle of the road
all day long. I have.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.200
-What exactly happened then?

16:11.233 --> 16:13.267
-I told her that her dog
was in the middle of Ashland

16:13.300 --> 16:15.067
and she continued
to blow it off,

16:15.067 --> 16:16.567
say, "It's okay, it's okay."

16:16.600 --> 16:19.133
And then finally
I came out the last time

16:19.167 --> 16:20.967
and her dog was
across the street on Ashland

16:21.067 --> 16:23.800
badgering these people who were
trying to walk their dog

16:23.833 --> 16:26.667
responsibly on a leash,
and so I told her again

16:26.700 --> 16:28.333
that her dog was
across the street.

16:28.367 --> 16:31.333
She runs across the street
and she shoos her dog across it,

16:31.367 --> 16:33.767
it almost gets hit once,
and then it starts

16:33.800 --> 16:36.067
to go over here and then
it goes back across the street

16:36.100 --> 16:38.633
and I could hear
a screeching of tires

16:38.667 --> 16:40.933
and I don't know if it was
the sound of the dog yelping,

16:40.967 --> 16:43.567
but all of a sudden I turn
around and this little girl has

16:43.600 --> 16:46.067
a dog in her arms,
and I asked her if it got hit.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.600
She said yeah, so then I call
Animal Control immediately.

16:48.633 --> 16:52.400
And then the woman is upset
that we are holding her dog,

16:52.433 --> 16:54.933
and we told her that it
just got hit by the car,

16:54.967 --> 16:56.900
and she grabs it
out of her arms,

16:56.933 --> 16:58.300
starts shaking it
by its legs,

16:58.333 --> 17:00.200
and says,
"This is my f-ing dog!

17:00.233 --> 17:02.100
There's nothing wrong
with this dog!"

17:02.133 --> 17:04.800
-And she's shaking his
back legs and everything else.
-Saying that it's her dog and...

17:04.833 --> 17:05.833
-Okay.

17:05.867 --> 17:07.900
-Then finally we ended up
getting it back,

17:07.933 --> 17:10.767
and now...
here we are.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.500
-Yeah, I walked up
to her and I said,
"Can I have the dog?"

17:13.533 --> 17:15.733
and she handed it over to me
and then I took it
on the other side.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.900
I laid it in the grass
because I wanted to see

17:17.933 --> 17:20.833
how bad the injuries were
and then she started--

17:20.867 --> 17:22.933
She went to her house
and everything

17:22.967 --> 17:25.500
and then she came back,
just going off again.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.700
-Last week,
we called Animal Control

17:27.733 --> 17:31.200
and she said that
we can't do nothing about it.

17:31.233 --> 17:33.900
That all we can do
is find him and give him back.

17:33.933 --> 17:35.933
I said, "Why? They're abusive!"

17:35.967 --> 17:37.600
-Okay.
-They beat him.

17:37.633 --> 17:40.133
-Okay.
-I mean, they beat him
over the head,

17:40.167 --> 17:42.600
they beat him when every--
wherever they want to hit him.

17:42.633 --> 17:44.067
-Hang on.

17:44.067 --> 17:45.767
-AC Officer:
We've chased this dog before.
If it got hit,

17:45.800 --> 17:46.967
gonna have to go to the vet.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.233
Is it okay? I mean,
it looks okay. I mean...

17:49.267 --> 17:52.300
-Yeah, they were talking
about the back legs

17:52.333 --> 17:54.867
maybe being injured.
-Okay.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.733
-(dog whimpering)

17:57.767 --> 18:00.100
-Do you guys have
a specific vet you take him to?

18:00.133 --> 18:03.200
'Cause this dog needs
to be seen by a vet. ASAP.

18:03.233 --> 18:05.567
-Children:
No.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.633
-You guys take him anywhere?
-He's never have been.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.867
-He's never have been?
Do you take him anywhere
to get his shots or anything?

18:10.900 --> 18:12.200
-No.

18:12.233 --> 18:14.133
-'Cause this dog's gonna
seriously need to see a vet

18:14.167 --> 18:15.900
just to make sure
things are okay and checked out.

18:15.933 --> 18:18.433
I'll go over and see
and check things out real quick.

18:18.467 --> 18:20.167
-Mother:
How much to take it back?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.633
-Do we need to pay
to get him back or...

18:22.667 --> 18:25.200
-Well, if he goes to the vet,
you'll be responsible

18:25.233 --> 18:27.600
for any vet...
for any vet bills, yes.

18:27.633 --> 18:29.667
-I'll pay, but a little bit,

18:29.700 --> 18:31.700
because we no,
we no too many money.

18:31.733 --> 18:34.367
-Okay. We're still
trying to figure out
everything that's going on.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.433
-(speaking Spanish)

18:38.133 --> 18:40.967
-Do you know
that some of the things

18:41.067 --> 18:42.467
that they're saying
are not true?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.900
-We can't understand
the people over there.

18:44.933 --> 18:46.800
-Okay, well, there's two sides
to every story.

18:46.833 --> 18:49.133
Okay? They're saying one thing,
you're saying another thing.

18:49.167 --> 18:52.600
The bottom line
is your dog got hit
and your dog is--

18:52.633 --> 18:54.533
-(children translating)

18:54.567 --> 18:56.400
-Yeah, this is the only
me understand too.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.600
-That's the only thing
she knows all so far

18:58.633 --> 19:01.533
because like,
she wasn't there to see.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.367
-Yeah. Yeah.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.733
So, but the dog is hit.

19:05.767 --> 19:08.100
The dog has to get checked out
by a veterinarian.

19:08.133 --> 19:09.567
-(translating)

19:09.600 --> 19:12.867
-Okay. We pay for it.
-And that, that's all
we know right now.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.533
-We pay. We pay later.
-Okay?

19:15.567 --> 19:17.100
-(dog whimpering)
-It's a good dog.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.367
-Kind of close your arm
in there. I'm sorry.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.067
-It's okay.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.933
He's dragging his legs.

19:22.967 --> 19:24.600
-Okay.

19:24.633 --> 19:28.433
-The dog is now on its way
to the veterinarian

19:28.467 --> 19:29.567
for any medical treatment.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.300
We're not even sure
of what the injuries are.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.833
We have the owners over here.

19:33.867 --> 19:37.267
What's gonna happen is right now
they're a little hard on money,

19:37.300 --> 19:39.167
so they'll be given
a time period

19:39.200 --> 19:42.367
to pay their vet bills,
and then from there,

19:42.400 --> 19:45.200
if they do not pay,
they will be issued citations

19:45.233 --> 19:48.500
for mistreatment of animals
and abandoned animals.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.067
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.067
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.167
Cover is code three.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.167
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.667 --> 20:07.633
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.667 --> 20:08.833
-(theme music playing)
