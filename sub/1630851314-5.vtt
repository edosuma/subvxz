Roswell, New Mexico...

No!
Stop!

00:04.587 --> 00:05.380
ISOBEL:
What'd he do to you?

00:05.422 --> 00:07.048
He told me I'm a clone.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.634
You deserve the life
I came here to give you.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.136
I've seen your X-rays.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.596
Let me help you, Max.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.223
Safety is a shared endeavor.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.019
MARIA:
I have these odd visions
sometimes.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.353
I think someone's
getting murdered.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.231
We need to get to that coffin.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.566
MARIA:
The Valenti coat of arms.

00:24.607 --> 00:25.942
Oh, my God, it's Kyle.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.360
(both grunting)

00:27.402 --> 00:29.237
Call an ambulance.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.572

HEATH:
You all right?

00:30.613 --> 00:32.073

Systolic BP's 170 and rising.

00:36.786 --> 00:40.707
Pushing 100 milligrams
of lidocaine.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.043
What happened? Heath?

00:43.084 --> 00:45.587
Hey, it's okay. I'm here.
You passed out.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.505
Paramedics think you went
into cardiac arrest.
(Liz gasping)

00:47.547 --> 00:48.715
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to cut your dress.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.176
No, no. No.
It's not my heart.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.344
(buzzing and whirring)

00:53.386 --> 00:54.387
Almost there.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.222

00:56.264 --> 00:57.307
You ready?
Mm-mm.

00:57.348 --> 00:58.892
Great. One... two...

00:58.933 --> 01:01.102
No. No, don't...
(grunts)

01:02.187 --> 01:03.563
Hang in there.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.608
Whoa, easy, easy.

Liz, if it's not your heart,

01:23.958 --> 01:26.211
You know what?
You tell her your damn self.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.046
(grunts)
Evans, no.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.089
Saving me will kill you.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.049
(grunting)

01:31.091 --> 01:33.134
I need Max Evans.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.761

I haven't had
to mainline acetone

02:16.427 --> 02:17.804

What the hell
were you thinking, antagonizing

02:25.353 --> 02:27.355
the prime suspect
of your impending murder?

02:27.397 --> 02:28.565
Look, some of the Regi-necks
roughed up a worker

02:28.606 --> 02:29.774
on the Lopez farm.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.401
All right? I went to
go talk to the sheriff

02:31.442 --> 02:33.736
when Jordan and the pointy end
of a railing got in the way.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.740
Why didn't you go to Max?

02:37.782 --> 02:39.200
How was I supposed to know

02:39.242 --> 02:41.161
I'm the coffin-filler
from your vision?

02:41.202 --> 02:44.372
In my vision, Alex said
we were covering up a murder.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.582
The only reason
we would do that is

02:45.623 --> 02:48.084
if there was something alien
to hide.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.712
Like, um... that?

02:50.753 --> 02:52.755
You didn't have that yesterday.

02:52.797 --> 02:55.216
Ash is still in the air.
Things are lining up.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.302
So you're benched
until this handprint disappears.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.637
Well, maybe I just got to
Kyle later in your vision,

02:59.679 --> 03:00.722
and I wasn't able to save him.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.265
Look, there's no maybe

03:02.307 --> 03:03.516
when it comes to his life.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.642
I want to take down
the Regiment

03:04.684 --> 03:06.394
just as bad as you guys do,

03:06.436 --> 03:08.897
but until this intergalactic
body glitter disappears,

03:08.938 --> 03:10.398
we're just gonna have
to bust out the puzzles

03:10.440 --> 03:12.233
and binge some Buffy.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.903
Act like it's quarantine
all over again.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.905
'Cause that was so much fun
the first time around.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.198
(phone chimes)

03:18.239 --> 03:19.699
(sighs)

03:21.701 --> 03:23.786
You look like someone
just got murdered.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.499
(sirens wailing)

03:32.754 --> 03:34.756
Knew them Lopezes
would crack one day.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.258
Says Deputy Deport 'Em
without checking any facts.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.009
Oh, we're saved.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.637
Department sent Lieutenant
Liberal to work the crime scene.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.138
TAYLOR:
Okay.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.765
What do we know
about the Lopezes

03:43.806 --> 03:45.975
besides Zeke Murphy's burnt body
being in the barn?

03:46.017 --> 03:49.062
Manny and Vinnie, they raise
alpacas, uh, grow sunflowers.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.688
They sponsor a T-ball team.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.523
They seem... political.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.691
Pot stirrers, ma'am.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.860
Or peaceful protestors.
Or murderers.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.612
Manny's got bruised knuckles

03:57.654 --> 04:00.198
that his husband claims is
from a slip on a deck.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.325
But we both know they're
not great with the truth.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.160
Manny's been living here
illegally for years.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.662
Actually,
they're citizens.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.163
Manny's family's been
in New Mexico

04:07.205 --> 04:08.164
since before it was a state,

04:08.206 --> 04:09.415
but I guess every Lopez

04:09.457 --> 04:10.667
looks undocumented to you,
right?

04:10.708 --> 04:12.085
Okay, the files I pulled
revealed

04:12.126 --> 04:13.670
a-a long-standing feud

04:13.711 --> 04:15.546
between Zeke and the Lopezes.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.383
Bar brawls, fence line disputes,
water rights.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.592
To me, that says motive.

04:19.634 --> 04:20.718
The evidence is circumstantial.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.886
Okay, but enough
to bring 'em in.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.471
You need to arrest them, Evans.
Ma'am?

04:23.513 --> 04:25.473
I really...
Okay, we impart order,

04:25.515 --> 04:26.724
Deputy.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.726
Don't forget
what that badge represents.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.359
Max, this is
a mistake, right?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.027
I'm sorry, guys.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.788
Explain to me again
why you're now suddenly

04:48.830 --> 04:50.915
in favor of throwing Max
into the lion's den?

04:50.957 --> 04:53.167
Jones showed us his memories.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.254
He fought for Max like a father.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.840
Turns out thawed-out Max
really cares about him.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.175
Yeah, but even if Jones
can't lie in the mindscape,

05:01.217 --> 05:03.261
that doesn't mean
he didn't slice off a memory

05:03.303 --> 05:04.679
that's gonna make him look
sympathetic.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.015
Hmm. And what's your point?

05:07.056 --> 05:10.310
That our intergalactic frenemy
is hiding something from us?

05:10.351 --> 05:11.853
Of course he is.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.062
It doesn't matter.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.398
We know for a fact
he doesn't want Max dead.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.358
Well, maybe not, but
he does want something.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.277
And we can't afford
to be careless.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.903
There is too much at stake.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.196
I agree.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.198
But we are running out of time

05:24.240 --> 05:26.326
and we're out of options.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.828
After what Max pulled
last night with Kyle...

05:28.870 --> 05:30.163
You're afraid
that it's gonna be soon.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.248
Aren't you?
(sighs)

05:32.290 --> 05:34.042
We know how much
this takes out of him.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.627
I made myself a promise
this morning, Iz.

05:36.669 --> 05:37.295
I'm gonna drink less tequila,

05:37.337 --> 05:40.214
and I'm gonna take care
of the people who matter.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.842
Okay.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.802
But give me the day, all right?

05:44.844 --> 05:46.220
Let me see what
I can find out.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.139
What am I supposed to do?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.141
I don't know, Michael.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.769
Find someone else
to take care of.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.609
(sighs)

05:59.650 --> 06:01.694
(quiet chatter)

06:03.696 --> 06:05.156
Updating the specials?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.532
We're closed for the day.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.368
Gregory and Bert are
helping me organize

06:08.409 --> 06:10.161
a march for the Lopezes.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.663
I could use
your artistic eye on this.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.915
¿Qué piensas?

06:13.956 --> 06:15.124
"Alien and proud."

06:15.166 --> 06:16.959
Okay, Liz is gonna freak out

06:17.001 --> 06:18.127
when she hears
that she missed this.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.797
Before my visa,
when I had no voice,

06:20.838 --> 06:22.215
people spoke out for me.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.175
Now, I have a voice,

06:24.217 --> 06:25.551
and it's...

06:25.593 --> 06:27.095
my job as an American to use it.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.013
Yeah, but...

06:29.055 --> 06:30.223
I mean, papi, you're at, like,

06:30.264 --> 06:31.557
the one-yard line
of citizenship.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.060
What if this jeopardizes
your status?

06:35.061 --> 06:37.313
The important things are
worth fighting for.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.357
You taught me that.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.484
Ten.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.446
Rosa loved raging
against the machine,

06:45.488 --> 06:48.783
but Rosalinda cannot afford
that kind of attention.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.160
I understand.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.578
But...

06:52.620 --> 06:55.123
you cannot be happy
if you can't be yourself.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.083
(door opens)

06:57.125 --> 06:59.794
Hey, stranger.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.879
It's good to see you.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.132
With, um... Kyle.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.427
Oh, no, I'm just babysitting.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.053
Can we at least
call it man-sitting?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.431
Greg,
what's going on here?

07:11.472 --> 07:14.142
Ah, a little Roswell activism.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.811
The Lopezes are being framed.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.689
So... we want the sheriff
to know that we don't approve.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.815
Grab a seat.

07:23.734 --> 07:24.902
Do not give me that look,
Valenti.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.154
We agreed to Shatner Shakes

07:26.195 --> 07:28.573
and seminal angsty
television shows.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.241
And my family protected this
community for a hundred years.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.909
I can't just turn my back
on them.
Well,

07:31.951 --> 07:33.786
I doubt either of your parents
would have wanted you dead.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.539
Uh, I'm a grown man.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.958
Okay? If I'm going down,
it's got to be swinging.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.087
(crowd cheering)

07:43.129 --> 07:44.714
Chin up.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.049
Kevlar looks good on you.
Hmm.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.718
BERT (over bullhorn):
Look, people of color
are being victimized,

07:48.759 --> 07:51.053
targeted and ignored,
and the sheriff's department

07:51.095 --> 07:52.722
has turned their backs on us.

07:52.763 --> 07:53.973
MAN: That's right.
WOMAN: Yeah.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.851
The Lopezes were unjustly
arrested today.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.979
And Brooke Taylor
is not the voice of fairness

08:00.021 --> 08:01.772
that she claims to be.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.858
Now, look, enough is enough.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.651
MAN: She's a liar.
CROWD (chanting):
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

08:05.693 --> 08:07.612
Sheriff Taylor
has got to go!

08:07.653 --> 08:09.363
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

08:09.405 --> 08:11.365
Sheriff Taylor has got to go!

08:11.407 --> 08:13.534
Hey, hey, ho, ho...

08:13.576 --> 08:15.286
Don't look surprised.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.039
The righteous are hard
to keep down.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.916
No clue what you're
talking about.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.752
Or we could go in that station
and clear up any confusion.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.046
Sheriff's a little bit busy
putting a long overdue end

08:25.087 --> 08:26.881
to the lawlessness around here.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.591
Don't you have anywhere to be,
Jordan?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.593
Yeah.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.887
Here.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.349
Taking in the voice
of change. Mmm.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.017
Noisy bunch, aren't they?

08:38.059 --> 08:40.645
Too bad no one cares to listen.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.147
Then we'll just have
to raise up the volume.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.524
And I'll get
all my powerful friends

08:44.565 --> 08:45.691
to make sure those bastards

08:45.733 --> 08:47.860
never see the outside
of a cell again.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.617
How long have I been out?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.369
(exhales)
Couple of hours.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.746
Here, drink this.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.375
I know I owe you
an explanation.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.502
You were having a heart attack,
at least that's what I thought

09:04.544 --> 09:06.587
until your vitals
didn't add up.
(exhales sharply)

09:06.629 --> 09:08.339
Liz, you are simultaneously
presenting symptoms

09:08.381 --> 09:12.176
of vascular degeneration
and African trypanosomiasis.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.971
You think this is
a parasitic infection?

09:15.012 --> 09:16.806
I have no idea.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.267
But I'm pretty sure that
the answer to your heart problem

09:19.308 --> 09:22.228
doesn't lie in a town full
of yahoos with tinfoil hats.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.063
(exhales)
Talk to me, Liz.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.898
You can barely hold
your head up.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.401
I-It's like something is sucking
the life force out of you.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.861
I am going to explain, okay?
Just not now.

09:30.903 --> 09:31.904
(gasps)

09:31.946 --> 09:33.990
Sure, fine.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.783
Actually, you know what?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.285
Not fine.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.828
At the very least,
tell me what Max Evans

09:38.869 --> 09:41.831
has to do with
any of-- Liz, hey.
(groaning)

09:41.872 --> 09:42.915
(gasping)

09:42.957 --> 09:44.792
Okay. That's it.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.377
I'm pulling over.
No, no, no, no. Don't stop.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.170
Keep driving.
(loud pop)

09:48.212 --> 09:49.380
(hissing)
(tires squealing)

09:49.422 --> 09:50.673
(gasping)

09:56.846 --> 09:58.055
Thought you
might be hungry.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.767
I don't want a damn snack.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.228
I'm trying to help you.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.397
Okay? I mean, this is obviously
a misunderstanding.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.316
Aren't I entitled
to a phone call?

10:08.357 --> 10:08.899
Yeah, of course.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.943
If you just explain to me
what happened,

10:10.985 --> 10:12.069
then maybe I can...

10:12.111 --> 10:13.487
Don't play good cop with me.

10:13.529 --> 10:14.697
I know you're allowed to lie

10:14.739 --> 10:16.407
to get me to say
whatever you want.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.618
When have I ever lied to you?

10:18.659 --> 10:21.245
I mean, aside from,
like, Thursday night poker

10:21.287 --> 10:22.747
when I'm trying
to bluff you out?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.667
Look, I know Zeke roughed up
one of your guys.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.211
Okay? Let me help you.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.172
The Regiment has been coming
around here for weeks,

10:31.213 --> 10:33.132
attacking our employees,

10:33.174 --> 10:34.300
messing with our livestock.

10:34.342 --> 10:34.925
We stood up to them,

10:34.967 --> 10:37.428
and they hung a Confederate flag
on our fence.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.679
Wait, why didn't you come to me?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.640
Because you're a cop.
I'm your friend.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.308
Not in that uniform, you're not.

10:44.685 --> 10:48.064
I said everything I need to say
to that reporter yesterday.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.609
Time's up, Evans.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.195
Our granola murderers here
just made bail.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.741
(indistinct chatter)
(rock music playing)

11:02.995 --> 11:04.622
I let you take a bathroom
break, and Max tells me

11:04.664 --> 11:05.247
you bailed out the Lopezes?

11:05.247 --> 11:07.792
I can't let innocent people
sit in jail when

11:07.833 --> 11:08.459
I have the means to help.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.171
If you want to help someone,
help me keep you alive.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.049
What you just did is gonna
enrage Jordan further.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.551
Of course he's gonna
be upset, but...
But nothing.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.552
I'm a Black woman in America.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.221
Don't you think I understand

11:20.262 --> 11:21.889
wanting to stop injustice?

11:21.931 --> 11:22.515
Don't you think I would

11:22.556 --> 11:25.643
rather be out there
inciting change in our town?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.228
A vision landed
in my head,

11:27.269 --> 11:30.481
and keeping you
from your own funeral is on me.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.817
You're right.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.695
You're right,
you shouldn't be babysitting me.

11:35.736 --> 11:36.821
You should be
out there.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.322
I can tell you
want to be.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.074
Who would watch you?

11:40.116 --> 11:41.325
MICHAEL:
I could.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.330
I mean, I bet I'd make
a pretty good bodyguard.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.500
Being alien and all.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.629
(click)

11:53.671 --> 11:55.131
(power whirs down)

11:55.172 --> 11:56.340
Hmm.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.802
You're not afraid I'll run?

11:59.844 --> 12:03.264
(sighs)
What kind of a white knight
would run away?

12:03.305 --> 12:08.477
Hmm. So you're here to kick the
tires on my offer to heal Max.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.689
To suss out
my emotions.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.649
Catch me in a lie.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.443
But, of course,
you can't do that

12:15.484 --> 12:17.570
with those bars between us.

12:17.611 --> 12:18.320
Well...

12:18.362 --> 12:22.700
if you have nothing to hide,
that shouldn't be a problem.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.076
Right?

12:24.118 --> 12:28.664
Well, if my motivations
are to be scrutinized,

12:28.706 --> 12:31.459
I may as well enjoy this steak
while you do it.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.753
To Max.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.045
Hmm.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.507
Okay, well, I got a D-minus
in high school shop class,

12:38.549 --> 12:39.216
but I'm pretty sure

12:39.258 --> 12:42.553
that the radiator hose
shouldn't smell like barbecue.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.598
(pained groan)

12:45.639 --> 12:47.975
Damn it!
Yup, that's hot, it's hot.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.060
Wh-Why would you do that?
I don't know, Liz.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.438
Because I'm an idiot,
obviously, and I have

12:52.480 --> 12:54.398
no idea what I'm doing here.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.649
(exhales)

12:55.691 --> 12:57.943
You mean driving me to my ex?

12:57.985 --> 12:59.320
(sighs)

12:59.361 --> 13:02.615
You do not need to be threatened
by Max Evans.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.074
We're done.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.493
Yet somehow the cop

13:05.534 --> 13:07.661
is the answer to your heart,
not the scientist.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.163
All I can tell you

13:09.205 --> 13:10.748
is that we went through
something like this before.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.834
Okay? You asked me to trust you,
and I did.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.796
Now it's your turn.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.048
Fine.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.758
But we still need

13:20.800 --> 13:22.843
to get you to a hospital, okay?
Chugging electrolytes

13:22.885 --> 13:24.178
isn't gonna bring
that fever down.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.888
But it'll get us
back on the road.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.307
(groans)

13:30.851 --> 13:33.604
As soon as I MacGyver
this into an intake hose.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.689
(takes deep breath)

13:37.066 --> 13:40.361
If you really
wanted to heal Max,

13:40.402 --> 13:43.405
why didn't you do it when
you knocked him unconscious?

13:43.447 --> 13:46.075
I wanted to say goodbye
to my life first.

13:46.116 --> 13:48.035
You wanted one last day.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.205
And tell me,

13:51.247 --> 13:52.498
what did you do with it?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.625
Well, I...

13:54.667 --> 13:56.544
I read a book.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.671
I befriended a dog.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.633
And I saw the sun
one last time.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.969
It's the same sun
as 70 years ago, but...

14:05.010 --> 14:06.679
it feels different somehow.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.097
It's hotter now.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.099
Dried up my old fishing spot.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.352
But the view there is...

14:13.394 --> 14:15.104
spectacular.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.730
Tell me more.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.985
I found out that you and I

14:21.026 --> 14:23.529
have a mutual acquaintance.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.949
Noah Bracken.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.450
I knew him
from back home.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.160
How long were you two
married?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.705
Let's let sleeping dogs lie,
shall we?

14:32.746 --> 14:34.290
So, what else
did you do?

14:34.331 --> 14:35.833
Well, I went to the hospital,

14:35.875 --> 14:37.501
and that's where I...

14:37.543 --> 14:40.337
saw the sad state
of Max's heart.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.137
You know what's my favorite part
about this new power?

14:48.178 --> 14:49.847
Hmm?

14:49.889 --> 14:53.267
When you finally get it
just right...

14:53.309 --> 14:56.562
there's a sort of a halo
that appears

14:56.604 --> 14:58.731
around the person
you're reading.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.859
Yours is yellow.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.986
Do you know
what yellow feels like?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.615
Deceit.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.744
So, why don't you take
another bite of that steak

15:11.785 --> 15:14.788
and tell me
what else you did yesterday?

15:22.671 --> 15:25.132
(chanting): Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Sheriff Taylor has got to go!

15:25.174 --> 15:28.969
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Sheriff Taylor has got to go!

15:29.011 --> 15:30.596
Of course, Mayor Bernhardt,

15:30.638 --> 15:32.640
I'm aware of Zeke Murphy's
family's investments

15:32.681 --> 15:34.767
in our city,
but with all due respect,

15:34.808 --> 15:36.018
this isn't my first rodeo,

15:36.060 --> 15:37.937
and this bull
isn't getting away from me.

15:37.978 --> 15:41.482
CROWD:
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Sheriff Taylor has got to go!

15:41.523 --> 15:44.109
Sheriff, the protests
aren't subsiding.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.861
Uh, maybe if you
made a statement

15:45.903 --> 15:47.863
about how we handled...
Don't start with me, Evans.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.164
(in distance):
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Sheriff Taylor has got to go!

15:57.206 --> 15:58.791
Releasing those two
wasn't enough.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.542
Those rioters out there
want us disbanded,

16:00.584 --> 16:02.252
defunded and dead.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.380
MAX:
I know these
people, ma'am.

16:04.421 --> 16:04.922
This isn't them.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.383
If anything,
this is Jordan Bernhardt.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.009
He wants a fight.
The mayor's son?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.594
Sheriff,
the Roswell Regiment

16:10.636 --> 16:12.137
is about blue lives mattering,
and, frankly,

16:12.179 --> 16:13.931
we could use their help
right about now.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.391
We are understaffed

16:15.432 --> 16:16.725
and we are clearly under
fire, and we don't have

16:16.767 --> 16:18.268
the badges to keep this
in check.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.104
I'm telling you,
the protestors wouldn't do this.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.981
Why? Because they're
your friends?

16:22.022 --> 16:23.440
Evans, get
me the names

16:23.482 --> 16:25.401
of all the protestors
with violent priors.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.611
You.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.154
Call up the Regiment.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.573
(chanting continues outside)

16:56.682 --> 16:57.766
only made burritos.
(chuckles)

16:58.767 --> 17:01.061
I recognize your voice.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.440
Your parents
raised you better than this.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.608
You don't know nothing,
old man.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.864
Papi!

17:11.905 --> 17:13.449
Hey, you stupid vatos,
get out of here, okay,

17:13.490 --> 17:15.159
before I call the cops.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.327
Here.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.371
Use my phone.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.540
Mouthy.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.876
Pretty little piñata.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.047
(grunting)

17:29.131 --> 17:30.758
Hey.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.051
Papi, are you okay?

17:32.092 --> 17:33.343
(panting):
Yeah.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.928
Those aliens...

17:34.970 --> 17:37.056
definitely didn't
come in peace.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.111
(sighs heavily)

17:51.153 --> 17:54.156
You think you know
what you're doing, Isobel,

17:54.198 --> 17:57.743
but three days' practice
does not an expert make.

17:57.785 --> 18:01.205
Don't "young grasshopper" me.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.624
I know what I feel
coming off of you.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.709
I don't think you do.
I might be
inexperienced,

18:05.751 --> 18:09.588
but trust me, I'm a quick study.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.757
And you went somewhere else
that day.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.885
You don't see me at all, do you?

18:14.927 --> 18:17.805
(exhales)
You only see him.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.389
Noah.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.350
Oh, he had

18:21.391 --> 18:24.978
a rotten soul-- I'm sure he
did not do right by you at all.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.648
This has nothing to do
with Noah.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.149
This has everything

18:29.191 --> 18:32.903
to do with Noah, because
you can't see past the pain

18:32.945 --> 18:34.655
he left in your life.

18:34.696 --> 18:38.033
That yellow that you see,
that's you, Isobel.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.701
That's what
you're feeling, not me.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.578
No.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.372
You're hiding something.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.665
Are you sure about that?

18:44.706 --> 18:46.917
All I see
when I look at you

18:46.959 --> 18:50.003
is fear and insecurity

18:50.045 --> 18:52.339
and distrust.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.967
And after yesterday,
I understand why.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.677
Noah.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.722
Are you really willing
to let Max die

19:00.764 --> 19:02.474
because you can't let go
of your own past?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.271
Get back in the cage.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.955
I heard you spoke
with the Lopezes.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.624
Couple of days ago
I interviewed them

19:27.666 --> 19:30.043
about how they were making waves
with Mayor Bernhardt.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.045
Well, that probably won't help
our cause.

19:32.087 --> 19:35.257
You know, Vinnie and I used to
throw back whiskey quite a bit.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.884
Now he won't open up to me.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.678
I guess I wouldn't want
to talk to me either.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.055
Most cops don't have
such compassion.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.391
What is it that
keeps yours so open?

19:44.433 --> 19:47.060
I grew up watching
the Valentis.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.729
They listened to all sides.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.063
They maintained the dignity.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.566
You wanted to be a hero.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.903
I just want to keep
what they had going alive.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.323
You know, they cared
about everyone in Roswell.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.949
They didn't
pick and choose.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.493
That should be
the bare minimum.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.288
But it sounds like
another planet to me.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.707
There's more of us
than you think.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.293
But definitely not enough.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.878
So I see

20:12.920 --> 20:15.130
where these protestors
are coming from.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.759
I know why they hate us.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.761
But when there's trouble
at 3:00 a.m.,

20:20.802 --> 20:22.554
they still dial 911.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.056
But this is bigger than that.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.183
The Wild Pony
was robbed

20:26.225 --> 20:28.018
by white supremacists.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.104
People are being harassed,
followed home.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.315
And Sheriff Taylor's looking
the other way.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.067
But it's not just her--
this is happening

20:35.108 --> 20:37.027
all across the country.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.446
I could run a stop sign,
and my story could turn sad

20:39.488 --> 20:40.989
at any moment.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.492
That's the system we live in.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.458
Yeah, well,
I believe in the work I do.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.710
But I understand
there's a lot broken.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.962
If you recognize that,

20:55.003 --> 20:56.797
how can you keep putting on
that uniform?

20:56.838 --> 20:59.549
I ask myself that every day.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.052
And every day...

21:02.094 --> 21:05.180
every day
I find a reason to put it on.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.059
Do you see that?

21:11.645 --> 21:13.063
Tire tracks.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.147
Right?

21:14.189 --> 21:16.233
Tracks on farms?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.986
The Lopezes are scraping by.

21:19.027 --> 21:24.324
Their truck is, what,
17 years old with balding tires.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.995
These tracks, these
are defined and fresh.

21:28.036 --> 21:32.249
They must have moved it
and pinned it on the Lopezes.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.334
(phone chimes)

21:41.633 --> 21:43.468
(door opens)

21:43.510 --> 21:44.886
Whoa, who are you?

21:44.928 --> 21:46.179
He's with me.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.347
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Liz.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.349
I-I'm okay, I'm okay.
Yeah?

21:49.391 --> 21:50.851
Yes.
Well, you must be Max Evans.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.145
Heath Tuchman.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.771
I-I was there
when she collapsed,

21:54.813 --> 21:57.441
then we practically broke the
sound barrier to... get here.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.859
You know what? Forget
I said that, Officer.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.362
No, I appreciate it. I'll, uh...

22:02.404 --> 22:04.072
I'll take it
from here.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.574
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'll stay.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.205
Heath, can you-- can you find
Dr. Jane Holden?

22:12.247 --> 22:14.666
She should be
able to help.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.876
Yeah?

22:15.917 --> 22:17.919
Yeah.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.005
Okay. I'll be back
as soon as I can.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.883
Okay.
(grunts)

22:26.261 --> 22:28.180
Liz, what is going on?

22:28.221 --> 22:29.389
I went into sudden
cardiac arrest

22:29.431 --> 22:30.599
last night, and since then

22:30.640 --> 22:32.434
I've been bouncing
between fatigue

22:32.476 --> 22:34.561
and dizziness and chills and...

22:34.603 --> 22:37.064
I short-circuited a car
'cause of this.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.648
I gave you that?

22:38.690 --> 22:41.818
But... no. Hand prints
can only transfer emotions.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.236
No, Max.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.072
I am experiencing
your heart failure.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.323
And if the
connection doesn't

22:46.365 --> 22:48.450
fade soon, it's gonna kill me.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.585
That was Max.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.212
He said it was the sheriff
that activated the Regiment.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.505
Well, can they do that?

23:01.546 --> 23:03.256
Oh, this country's
got a long history

23:03.298 --> 23:04.925
of police collusion
with local militias.

23:04.966 --> 23:05.592
I mean, my mom tried
to keep Roswell

23:05.634 --> 23:09.596
from going down that road,
but Taylor is no Valenti.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.431
Guess she's trying to protect
the town from all the rioting

23:11.473 --> 23:13.683
and looting we of course
were gonna do.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.936
Well, we're not gonna fold
to Roswell's racist social club.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.687
Hmm, I agree with my man-sitter.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.106
No, we're not gonna do that.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.274
By now the Regiment
knows it was Kyle

23:21.316 --> 23:22.776
who bailed out
the Lopezes.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.319
And add that to their
newfound authority,

23:24.361 --> 23:27.197
that gives us a huge bull's-eye
on Kyle's back.

23:28.365 --> 23:31.827
So, I hate to admit it,
but our only option

23:31.868 --> 23:33.537
is to take Jordan out of play.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.248
They follow him as a leader,
so...

23:36.289 --> 23:39.042
take him out,
the Regiment falls.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.752
ROSA:
I would really,

23:40.794 --> 23:42.629
really love to take down
the bitch-ass racists

23:42.671 --> 23:45.507
who have been targeting
my family for a decade.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.260
So put me in, coach.
Rosalinda's tired of hiding.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.011
Happy to have you both
on the team.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.097
Great.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.723
What is the team doing?

23:53.765 --> 23:55.559
This might help.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.936
Swiped that off one of the
maggots who attacked my dad

23:57.978 --> 23:59.855
and who was stupid enough
to show me his passcode.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.816
80085.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.152
"BOOBS."

24:06.194 --> 24:08.238
(panting)

24:09.698 --> 24:11.741
(grunts)

24:14.536 --> 24:17.247
(panting)

24:18.832 --> 24:21.084
JONES:
It dried up my old fishing spot,

24:21.126 --> 24:25.714
but the view there
is spectacular.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.676
(sniffles)

24:34.931 --> 24:36.892
(laughs softly)

24:38.685 --> 24:40.979
I knew Evans' magically-fixed
heart was too good to be true.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.573
MAX:
Her fingers are blue.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.742
Yeah, her oxygen
levels are dropping.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.160
Can't we boost that?

24:55.202 --> 24:57.078
It'd be like putting a Band-Aid
on an amputation.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.622
And we're sure
it's the handprint?

24:58.663 --> 24:59.915
LIZ:
Heath thought that

24:59.956 --> 25:01.166
my symptoms were due
to a vascular infection

25:01.208 --> 25:02.417
caused by a parasite.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.043
When a parasite

25:03.084 --> 25:06.254
is under attack,
it launches a defense mechanism,

25:06.296 --> 25:07.672
draining energy
from its host.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.383
When Max healed me,
it should have killed him.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.802
In order to keep your organs
from shutting down...

25:12.844 --> 25:16.014
I siphoned energy from
the person I'm tethered to. Liz.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.474
(coughing)
KYLE: Whoa, whoa.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.643
She's nearing
end-stage arrhythmia.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.812
Well, okay, maybe I can stop it.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.900
(panting)

25:28.860 --> 25:29.653
(grunts)

25:29.694 --> 25:31.321
You're hurting him.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.697
It's not just Liz.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.493
You're tethered to Kyle, too.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.411
It's like your life forces,
they're-they're tied together.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.830
If you heal her,
it's gonna kill him.

25:44.584 --> 25:48.255
Four ríos down, one to go.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.300
(scoffs)
Best fishing spot my ass.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.303
What were you doing out here,
Diet Max?

25:55.345 --> 25:57.222
(crackles)

26:06.982 --> 26:09.276
Clearly you used
your fire ability,

26:09.317 --> 26:10.652
but what did you burn?

26:14.364 --> 26:16.074
(gasps)

26:17.033 --> 26:18.952
(panting)

26:22.872 --> 26:24.916
JORDAN:
These murderers
are running free.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.252
It's time we sent
a strong message.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.629
That's why I called our friends
in Lincoln and Otero County.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.214
They'll be here soon.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.466
Y-You called in
other people?

26:33.508 --> 26:37.345
Mm-hmm.
Dude, this is the
Roswell Regiment.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.388
(scoffs)
Now, I got to get

26:38.430 --> 26:39.889
back to work before the sheriff

26:39.931 --> 26:41.391
finds out that I'm gone.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.643
If you know what's
good for you,

26:43.685 --> 26:45.270
you'll leave, too.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.152
(car door opens)

26:52.193 --> 26:53.695
You ready for this?
(engine starts)

26:53.737 --> 26:55.947
BROCK:
I certainly am.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.960
(shouts)

27:09.002 --> 27:10.253
You guys are late!

27:10.295 --> 27:11.671
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago!

27:11.713 --> 27:13.214
Damn riots outside held us up.

27:13.256 --> 27:15.258
MARIA:
Jordan,
just put the gun down.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.259
You don't want
to be a murderer.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.260
You don't know anything about me

27:17.302 --> 27:18.845
or what I want, DeLuca.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.805
I lost a friend, too, okay?
I've felt that pain before.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.265
Oh, yeah?
(gun cocks)

27:22.307 --> 27:24.267
Did you find
your friend's body? Huh?

27:24.309 --> 27:26.811
Zeke was so burnt up, I could
only recognize his shoes.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.105
The Lopezes have had it out
for Zeke since day one

27:29.147 --> 27:32.692
'cause he dared to stand up to
the infestation taking over.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.323
We're gonna burn down
their house.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.741
Give Zeke the justice
he deserves.

27:39.783 --> 27:40.950
What if you're wrong?

27:40.992 --> 27:42.577
Whoever killed Zeke
is a monster,

27:42.619 --> 27:44.079
but if it wasn't the Lopezes,

27:44.120 --> 27:44.704
how are you doing
right by your friend?

27:44.704 --> 27:48.416
Also, your sadness
does not excuse your racism.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.459
Y'all love throwing
around that word.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.710
Always playing the victim.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.837
System's rigged
against guys like me!

27:52.879 --> 27:54.798
MARIA:
The thing about guys
like you, Jordan,

27:54.839 --> 27:58.051
is that somehow all of your
problems are magically caused

27:58.093 --> 27:59.803
by people who don't
look like you.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.388
When does the guy in the mirror
get judged?

28:01.429 --> 28:02.013
This isn't about me.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.516
People need to know the truth.
Which is what?

28:04.557 --> 28:06.685
That they murdered my friend!

28:06.726 --> 28:08.770
Hated what he stood for so much

28:08.812 --> 28:09.979
that they left him out there
in the cold

28:10.021 --> 28:11.564
where no one
would ever find him.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.191
You moved his body.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.442
You're damn right I did.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.779
Come on. Let's do this.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.030
Give me the gas can. Come on.

28:25.161 --> 28:26.788
This livestream
is hitting

28:26.830 --> 28:28.289
all the Times feeds.

28:28.331 --> 28:29.499
10,000 views already.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.459
Not bad for a small town beat.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.005
(grunting)

28:36.047 --> 28:37.298
(coughing)

28:37.340 --> 28:39.300
(groans)

28:39.342 --> 28:40.802
Heal them.

28:40.844 --> 28:44.139
The problem is you,
Max, not them.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.851
Let me heal
your heart.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.728
It's the only way to save Liz.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.106
Do it.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.780
(groaning)

29:13.418 --> 29:16.171
Don't let him touch you.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.672
He's a murderer.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.176
You killed Zeke.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.260
JONES:
I had to.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.012
You were gonna die.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.638
I saw your scans
in Dr. Valenti's office,

29:25.680 --> 29:27.640
the irreparable heart damage.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.476
What, so you decided
to kill someone?

29:30.727 --> 29:32.187
I didn't want to.

29:32.228 --> 29:33.605
But I didn't have the strength

29:33.646 --> 29:35.523
to save him
if I didn't.

29:35.565 --> 29:36.733
MICHAEL:
And you conveniently
left that

29:36.775 --> 29:38.276
out of last night's
fireside chat.

29:38.318 --> 29:39.611
Would you have let me
heal him if I told you?

29:39.652 --> 29:41.070
I wanted to spare you

29:41.112 --> 29:43.531
the burden of making
an impossible decision.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.284
It is our burden,
decision or not.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.952
I spent my last few hours

29:47.994 --> 29:49.370
looking for the most
wicked person

29:49.412 --> 29:50.872
I could find.

29:50.914 --> 29:54.083
And when I found Zeke, he was
beating a farmer to death.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.044
So you followed him
down to Rio Hondo

29:56.085 --> 29:58.046
and then you burned him alive.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.465
Zeke's life is not as
valuable as your brother's.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.217
(Liz and Kyle coughing)

30:03.301 --> 30:04.803
Listen
to my feelings,

30:04.844 --> 30:07.096
Isobel, I'm not lying.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.057
I traded
the life of one

30:09.098 --> 30:11.142
evil racist for the lives
of three good people.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.685
Does that make me a villain?

30:12.727 --> 30:14.521
KYLE (strains):
Guys...

30:14.562 --> 30:17.148
Guys, she's seizing!
She's seizing.

30:17.190 --> 30:17.732
JONES:
You're the savior, Max.

30:17.732 --> 30:20.860
No one understands this
better than I do.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.070
Do it.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.156
Do it.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.492
Go ahead.

30:28.284 --> 30:29.869
(grunts, screams)

30:36.459 --> 30:39.379
(strains)

30:39.420 --> 30:40.964
Howdy, partner.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.592
How do you feel?

30:44.634 --> 30:47.136
Better than I have
in a long time.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.225
How's, uh, uh, Liz and...

30:52.267 --> 30:54.143
Kyle? They're good.
Yeah.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.354
He drove her home.
Great.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.314
Well, I appreciate y'all, uh,

30:58.356 --> 30:59.732
not giving up
on us.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.317
We are a united front.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.236
That's what matters.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.739
(grunts)

31:06.781 --> 31:08.825
(exhales)

31:08.867 --> 31:10.410
All right.

31:10.451 --> 31:11.870
I will get the silver.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.580
You guys get him ready
for the pod.

31:13.621 --> 31:14.998
Hey.

31:22.046 --> 31:24.090
(laughs)

31:29.220 --> 31:32.724
KYLE:
You remember
this as a kid?

31:32.765 --> 31:36.352
Sana, sana, colita
de rana, rana.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.438
Are you channeling the mystical

31:38.479 --> 31:39.981
healing properties of Vaporu

31:40.023 --> 31:41.482
right now?
Ooh, maybe.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.151
Oh, yeah?

31:43.192 --> 31:45.695
Your pulse is steady. I think
you're out of the woods.

31:47.488 --> 31:50.199
I was awful to you
the last time I was here.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.536
And yet here you are.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.081
Don't you remember?

31:57.123 --> 31:59.167
We're family.

31:59.208 --> 31:59.918
Mm-hmm.

31:59.959 --> 32:03.129
Besides, the only person
I was really mad at was myself.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.883
For not taking a stand
in my own life.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.093
When I saw you taking
a stand in yours.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.390
I quit Genoryx.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.018
I'm not going
back to L.A.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.354
My purpose has always been here.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.607
In my own backyard.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.737
I have a feeling
you already knew that, though.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.739
I'm glad you're back.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.950
(knocking)

32:33.368 --> 32:35.078
Oh, Kyle,
this is Heath, my...

32:35.119 --> 32:36.287
Colleague.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.333
Hey.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.502
Hey. (clears throat)

32:42.543 --> 32:45.213
I'm gonna check on Evans.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.346
There is no...

32:53.388 --> 32:56.015
Dr. Jane Holden, is there?

32:59.477 --> 33:01.229
Liz, I trusted you.

33:01.270 --> 33:04.023
I mean, you said
you trusted me...

33:04.065 --> 33:05.274
I do.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.819
(exhales)
I just...

33:09.028 --> 33:10.655
I want to tell you everything.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.657
I just, I--
the truth is, I can't.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.283
It would put

33:14.325 --> 33:15.827
people that I care about
in harm's way.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.495
So then your first instinct was

33:17.537 --> 33:19.080
to send me
on some wild goose chase?

33:19.122 --> 33:21.416
I'm sorry, I just, I didn't feel
like I had another choice.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.167
Well, you could
have been honest.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.628
I mean, ask me to step away
while you and Max talked about

33:25.670 --> 33:27.964
whatever it is
you needed to talk about.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.966
Would I have liked it? No.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.218
But I-I would have understood,
I would have respected it.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.469
I didn't want to hurt you.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.267
You know, when you coded
last night, I...

33:39.308 --> 33:41.561
I was terrified

33:41.602 --> 33:43.771
that you were gonna die.

33:43.813 --> 33:47.150
And then you gave me
this task that I believed

33:47.191 --> 33:49.485
was the single avenue
to saving your life.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.279
So I told myself,

33:51.320 --> 33:53.239
I was damn well not
gonna screw that up.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.615
I mean, do you have any idea

33:54.657 --> 33:56.701
what my mind went through
every single time

33:56.743 --> 33:57.910
I hit a dead end today?

33:57.952 --> 33:59.996
Heath...
That I was failing you!

34:00.038 --> 34:02.707
And not
in some dumb lab experiment.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.417
In keeping you alive.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.377
It was the one time

34:06.419 --> 34:08.838
in my life that
what I did actually mattered.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.424
And I couldn't find
the only person

34:11.466 --> 34:12.925
who could fix you.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.347
So, yeah.

34:20.016 --> 34:23.227
I know that you may not have
wanted to hurt me, Liz...

34:24.604 --> 34:28.191
...but I cannot imagine a way
you could have hurt me any more.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.740
So much for saving
the world together.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.373
ROSA:
Did Liz ask you to do that?

34:46.626 --> 34:48.336
Uh...

34:48.377 --> 34:50.421
no.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.757
It's the least I can do.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.968
Go home.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.554
I absolve you of your crimes.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.894
Hey, uh...

35:04.936 --> 35:07.480
You know, when I was a-a kid...

35:09.732 --> 35:11.901
...feeling guilty...

35:13.361 --> 35:15.196
...I used to lie
in my truck thinking about

35:15.238 --> 35:17.782
what Rosa Ortecho would be like
all grown up.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.909
Hmm.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.410
I always thought if you didn't
get to live a life,

35:21.452 --> 35:23.204
that I didn't
deserve one either.

35:24.997 --> 35:27.250
And that felt
like a fitting punishment.

35:28.751 --> 35:31.629
Well, I'm here now.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.927
We were scared.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.429
And we were stupid.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.599
And we should've known
what putting you

35:43.641 --> 35:45.143
in that driver's seat would do.

35:49.772 --> 35:52.650
And I wish, I wish I could
give you some kind of justice.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.361
But this is, sadly,
the best that I can do.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.822
(chuckles)

36:00.241 --> 36:03.244
I've never heard you say
this many words at once.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.788
It's freaky.

36:05.830 --> 36:09.125
Not a lot of people
get a second chance

36:09.167 --> 36:11.169
to make things right.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.713
You did, though.

36:13.754 --> 36:16.465
Makes me think
there's hope for me yet.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.551
(chuckles)

36:20.928 --> 36:23.681
Maybe there is.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.900
I knew you'd
still be here.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.364
Thank you for saving my life.

36:41.782 --> 36:45.328
That is the least I can do
to return the favor.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.538
I was, um,

36:47.580 --> 36:50.583
sitting in my room, trying
to recover from almost dying,

36:50.625 --> 36:53.002
and I realized
I never got a good look

36:53.044 --> 36:54.962
at the reason
we're not together.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.966
Well, the reason for that

36:59.008 --> 37:01.928
is far more complicated
than a man in a pod.

37:01.969 --> 37:04.597
You mean like the fact that we
can't stop hurting each other

37:04.639 --> 37:06.599
no matter how hard we try?

37:07.600 --> 37:09.143
I'm sorry.

37:09.185 --> 37:12.021
I never meant to do what I did.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.024
You aren't the only one
hurting people.

37:17.693 --> 37:20.071
I was terrible to Heath today.

37:20.112 --> 37:22.240
And in a moment

37:22.281 --> 37:24.450
where I had to choose,

37:24.492 --> 37:26.702
I chose you.

37:28.287 --> 37:29.956
I knew what that

37:29.997 --> 37:34.001
would do to him,
but I sent him away anyway.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.462
Because I had to

37:36.504 --> 37:38.881
for all of us.

37:39.882 --> 37:43.427
But also 'cause I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

37:45.429 --> 37:48.557
The connection between us,
it's hard to break.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.184
It's...

37:50.226 --> 37:52.812
We're caught
in each other's orbits.

37:52.853 --> 37:54.522
Orbits decay.

37:54.563 --> 37:58.401
And eventually everything
in them spirals away

37:58.442 --> 38:02.321
and burns up, so what's that
saying about us, Max?

38:02.363 --> 38:04.323
About what we are doing

38:04.365 --> 38:06.534
to the people around us?

38:16.544 --> 38:18.879
There was a lot of harm done
in our community today.

38:18.921 --> 38:21.173
Mistakes were made
on all fronts.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.675
As for Zeke Murphy,

38:22.717 --> 38:25.761
toxicology confirms
there was no foul play.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.680
His death was caused
by a tragic mix

38:27.722 --> 38:30.641
of too much alcohol
and a lit cigarette.
Wow.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.018
We are looking into...

38:32.059 --> 38:34.645
I mean,
it's almost impressive.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.605
I just hope
she stretched her hammies

38:36.647 --> 38:39.150
before doing
all that dodging.

38:39.191 --> 38:43.029
At least the charges against
the Lopezes were dropped.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.865
Jordan's sitting in
the cell they vacated.

38:45.906 --> 38:49.035
That's true.
Although, as the mayor's son,

38:49.076 --> 38:51.245
I'm guessing he's gonna spend
a lot less time in it.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.080
Now is not the time...

38:53.122 --> 38:54.623
