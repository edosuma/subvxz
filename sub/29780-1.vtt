you are a wanted war criminal

I'm here to see that those
wishes are carried out.

05:35.500 --> 05:39.870
And how exactly do you
plan on carrying that out?

05:39.872 --> 05:41.872
Can start by finding
an oak tree big enough

to hold a man of your stature.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.014

Well, I'll not be swingin'
from an oak tree today.

thought you could come here

your utter stupidity.

kindly to such a proposal, sir.

And I'll be goddamned if I'm
gonna think of my daughter

22:34.885 --> 22:37.755
going to visit
her mother's grave

22:39.257 --> 22:43.828
with an image of me swinging
up above her at the time.

22:54.838 --> 22:56.006
I will not hang you.

22:57.642 --> 22:59.009
I will not shoot you.

23:00.778 --> 23:03.048
I will let you pass
as God sees fit.

23:05.048 --> 23:06.414
But I will stay here for it.

23:06.416 --> 23:09.653
It's my job to watch men like
you take their last breath.

23:12.155 --> 23:14.759
That is the burden I
must carry in this life.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.066
Heavy burden, isn't it, son?

23:28.940 --> 23:31.574
Will these accommodations
be all right?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.676
More than all right, mam.

23:33.678 --> 23:34.513
Sarah.

23:35.946 --> 23:36.847
MATHIAS: Sarah.

23:39.651 --> 23:40.519
Come.

23:43.587 --> 23:45.555
If you'll be needing to
put your things anywhere,

23:45.557 --> 23:49.592
we have a chest for you.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.461
Feel free.

23:51.695 --> 23:52.530
Thank you.

24:01.705 --> 24:02.740
Why carry two?

24:05.042 --> 24:08.009
Better to have two
loaded guns when needed.

24:08.011 --> 24:11.212
Any occupation that requires
a man to carry such firepower

24:11.214 --> 24:12.884
must be of mighty importance.

24:14.285 --> 24:17.221
Or of the law-breaking kind.

24:19.222 --> 24:21.659
But then it's none of
my business what you do.

24:23.861 --> 24:27.228
It's been such a long time
since we've had a horse here.

24:27.230 --> 24:28.098
Why's that?

24:32.903 --> 24:35.073
Probably because we
can't keep 'em alive.

24:39.876 --> 24:43.013
Heck, we can barely
keep ourselves alive.

24:47.250 --> 24:52.257
You see, there's some men around
here who would like to see

24:53.023 --> 24:54.289
this land taken from us.

24:54.291 --> 24:58.026
One man in particular
goes by the name of Quaid.

24:58.028 --> 25:00.030
It was his men you
saw here this morning.

25:01.633 --> 25:06.136
Now that Father is dying, he
sees a greater opportunity.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.742
They'll do anything
to try and run us off.

25:12.644 --> 25:13.577
This is tough country.

25:14.945 --> 25:17.014
It takes an even
tougher soul to tame it.

25:18.148 --> 25:20.216
Fact is, you kept
it going this long.

25:20.218 --> 25:22.053
Means you got a lot
of fight in you.

25:23.221 --> 25:24.955
It's an admirable
quality, Sarah.

25:29.426 --> 25:31.829
Well, I'll leave
you to it then.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.768
You know, I'm making some stew.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.238
I thought maybe you
might want to join me.

25:42.406 --> 25:44.673
Or if you're tired
from your journey,

25:44.675 --> 25:47.008
I will understand if
you'd prefer to rest.

25:47.010 --> 25:48.344
I can bring you a bowl.

25:48.346 --> 25:49.847
I would love to join you.

25:54.218 --> 25:58.223
All right then, I'll see you
inside in just a little bit.

26:23.181 --> 26:24.783
I hope it's all right.

26:25.982 --> 26:28.986
I'm not exactly the best cook.

26:30.721 --> 26:32.822
Anything is better
than hard tack.

26:32.824 --> 26:33.991
I suppose that's true.

26:35.393 --> 26:40.365
So tell me, Mr. Breecher, did
you really come all this way

26:41.132 --> 26:42.898
just to see my father?

26:42.900 --> 26:45.070
Please, call me Mathias.

26:48.472 --> 26:49.340
I did.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.846
And for reasons I
should not be privy to?

26:57.115 --> 27:01.152
No, but I would think
them not much important now.

27:05.021 --> 27:07.856
Father must have seen a
bootfull of kindness in you

27:07.858 --> 27:10.125
to ask you to stay like he did.

27:10.127 --> 27:13.731
I mean, I have never seen
him have overnight company.

27:19.303 --> 27:22.270
I imagine we see eye to
eye on a good many things.

27:22.272 --> 27:23.173
I would hope so.

27:24.842 --> 27:26.311
How long you been on the trail?

27:28.211 --> 27:33.151
One year, six
months, three days.

27:34.852 --> 27:35.887
That's a long time.

27:36.953 --> 27:39.020
Now you're really
temptin' me to ask

27:39.022 --> 27:40.658
what it is you do for a living.

27:54.471 --> 27:55.706
I'm a detective.

28:00.377 --> 28:01.879
You come to see my father.

28:12.088 --> 28:14.692
You know, he became a
different man after the war.

28:17.228 --> 28:18.296
Haunted like.

28:20.897 --> 28:22.864
He wouldn't tell me much
about what happened,

28:22.866 --> 28:26.003
but I know he regrets it.

28:28.239 --> 28:29.471
He was afraid.

28:29.473 --> 28:33.976
Afraid of possible
repercussions from his actions.

28:33.978 --> 28:36.845
And that's why he up and
took us all the way out here

28:36.847 --> 28:38.048
to the middle of nowhere.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.982
He feared that somehow
we'd be caught up

28:40.984 --> 28:42.820
in whatever was comin' for him.

28:44.255 --> 28:48.390
My mother, well, this land
was just too hard for her.

28:48.392 --> 28:53.264
She hated it, and she died
shortly after we came here.

28:54.598 --> 28:57.402
And for quite some time,
I did blame him for that.

29:00.270 --> 29:03.074
But there's good
in him, I seen it.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.275
He's trying to reform himself.

29:06.277 --> 29:09.879
He built a decent life
for me and him here.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.282
He has changed.

29:14.317 --> 29:16.517
Maybe I should go.

29:16.519 --> 29:17.756
Please don't leave.

29:36.374 --> 29:40.044
Whatever his sins,
whatever his demons,

29:42.212 --> 29:45.282
they die with him
as will the past.

29:48.451 --> 29:50.054
And what will you do, Sarah?

29:51.388 --> 29:54.957
Oh, well I have given
that a great deal of thought

29:54.959 --> 29:56.158
as of late.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.464
This land has been
something of a challenge,

30:01.031 --> 30:04.067
but nothin' would suit me
better than to tame it.

30:07.505 --> 30:09.238

30:09.240 --> 30:11.606
Yes, this is good land.

crops, for farmin'.

I mean, that is a
profitable venture.

30:27.023 --> 30:30.092
Well I was a cattle drover
on the plains for a short time.

30:30.094 --> 30:30.961

and fortitude.

Hey, you don't
die easy, do you?

Well, you know that old saying.

01:44:32.765 --> 01:44:35.534
You want a good job done,
you got to do it yourself.

01:44:59.192 --> 01:45:01.694
I didn't get to where
I'm at by being slow.

old-fashioned dime novel showdown?

Oh, oh, you're hurt real bad.

01:46:45.731 --> 01:46:47.197
Someone fetch the doctor!

01:46:47.199 --> 01:46:48.068
My horse.

01:46:49.903 --> 01:46:50.737
My horse.

I know, I'll send 'em a report

01:47:42.956 --> 01:47:44.821
and tell 'em what happened here.

01:47:44.823 --> 01:47:45.858

Means you got something
more important

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:56.783
than your own health, my friend.

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:04.658
You deserve peace, Mathias.

01:51:11.096 --> 01:51:12.666
I'm stained, broken.

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:20.105
I am unfit for it.

01:51:26.078 --> 01:51:27.914
You were borne of violence.

01:51:28.814 --> 01:51:30.916
Now be still.
