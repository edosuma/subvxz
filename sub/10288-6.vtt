00:06.072 --> 00:08.842
-What are you reading there?
-Bartlett's Book of Quotations.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.809
This is great stuff.
There is a quote for every occasion.

00:12.145 --> 00:13.665
-May I. sir?
HARRY: Sure.

00:16.015 --> 00:19.845
He crams with cans of poisoned meat
The subject of the king

00:20.018 --> 00:24.578

Why, he laughs like anything

Whoa.

00:37.633 --> 00:41.093
-Guess who is coming here tonight.
-Oh. give us a hint.

00:41.270 --> 00:45.040
-Somebody I mentioned a thousand times.
-Fatty Arbuckle.

00:46.876 --> 00:50.276
-Who is it that's coming. Dan?
-Chip.

00:53.614 --> 00:54.884
Chip Collins?

00:55.049 --> 00:57.979
Hey. pork belly futures are up.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.900
Yeah. he's the one
who went into priesthood. right?

01:09.063 --> 01:10.933
No. that was Bubba Patterson.

01:11.632 --> 01:13.572
Father Bubba?

01:15.134 --> 01:17.474
He didn't make it.
He's with Green Bay now.

01:17.637 --> 01:18.927
So who's Chip?

01:19.104 --> 01:21.944
Chip. my best friend.
my closest buddy. my spiritual twin.

01:22.107 --> 01:24.297
[LAUGHS]

01:24.476 --> 01:26.736
Once in high school.
right before the big game...

01:26.912 --> 01:28.902
...we stole our rival team's mascot.

01:29.081 --> 01:30.551
This little German shepherd puppy.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.176
[LAUGHS]

01:32.351 --> 01:36.081
-You stole a little puppy?
-That was the best part.

01:36.255 --> 01:38.615
After we shaved it.
you couldn't tell what it was.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.020
[LAUGHS]

01:40.191 --> 01:42.661
Dan. that was cruel.

01:42.827 --> 01:45.727
Oh. come on. we glued the hair back on.

01:47.431 --> 01:51.561
So. what brings old Snips-and-Snails-

Hey. Bull. what about Dan?

03:31.863 --> 03:33.423
It's okay.

You had me going.
What a gag. what a pistol. Ha. ha.

03:50.748 --> 03:54.648
Put your real clothes back on. before
somebody mistakes you for a woman.

Hey. Dan. Dan. take it easy.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.708
Take it easy?

04:29.886 --> 04:34.376
This is not his lucky rabbit's foot he lost.
Harry. We're talking an appendage.

04:36.826 --> 04:38.756
I knew it was gonna be a shock to him.

04:38.928 --> 04:41.948
I just couldn't think of a way
to break it to him gently.

04:42.531 --> 04:43.931
She's very pretty. Dan.

04:44.099 --> 04:46.499
But I thought your friend was a man.

04:46.668 --> 04:48.028
He was.

04:48.436 --> 04:50.496
I had an operation. Bull.

04:50.671 --> 04:53.141
Uh. I had a sex change.

04:53.774 --> 04:55.504
Oh. yeah?

04:57.377 --> 05:00.747
Does this have anything to do
with the birds and the bees?

05:01.514 --> 05:04.714
In a high-tech sort of way.

05:05.351 --> 05:07.411
You know.
I have heard about these things...

05:07.587 --> 05:10.147
...but I've never actually met anyone
who had one.

05:10.323 --> 05:13.053
Ha. ha. Don't be so sure.

05:13.326 --> 05:15.416
It's more common than you think.

05:15.595 --> 05:21.255
Trust me. It may not be mint.
but this is all my original equipment.

05:28.508 --> 05:31.208
So how about those Knicks. huh?

05:31.377 --> 05:33.737
Heh. They need a power forward.

05:35.648 --> 05:38.238
I ought to know. I used to be one.

05:39.017 --> 05:43.217
And I thought the legs
were the first thing to go.

05:45.691 --> 05:49.891
-Dan. let me try and explain--
-Go away!

05:50.062 --> 05:51.692
Dan. this is your friend.

05:51.864 --> 05:53.354
This is a gelding.

05:53.532 --> 05:57.232
My friend is in a bottle
of formaldehyde somewhere.

06:00.905 --> 06:05.535
Well. it's obvious you old buddies
have a lot to talk about. so....

06:12.984 --> 06:17.054
Maybe I can explain it to you
with your Cabbage Patch doll.

06:20.691 --> 06:22.961
You know. Dan.
an old saying just occurred to me.

06:23.127 --> 06:26.587
Don't judge a man
until you've walked a mile in his shoes.

06:27.431 --> 06:30.871
We used to wear
each other's shorts. Harry.

06:31.335 --> 06:33.595
It needed updating.

06:35.406 --> 06:38.836
It's true.
You can't judge a book by its cover.

this is too much mascara. then?

I'm very happy now.

you're healthy. your accessories match.

07:03.133 --> 07:07.233

believing this. but I had to do what I did.

07:08.705 --> 07:12.335
After I realized the truth about myself.
how I always felt unnatural.

How I always had to prove myself
by hustling every girl I met.

07:16.279 --> 07:17.299
I hated it.

07:17.948 --> 07:19.808
-You hated it?
-Every minute.

07:19.983 --> 07:21.853
But you were so good at it.

07:23.320 --> 07:26.090
I was just one of the guys
on the outside.

07:26.256 --> 07:30.846
Inside I was desperately yearning to be
one of the girls.

07:32.561 --> 07:35.431
I let you watch me shower.

the happiness of my wedding.

then found out she was a woman.

-Right.
-Who told her?

08:17.905 --> 08:21.065
-Himself.
-Got it.

we could show him.

Why it doesn't say Brunswick
across the top of his head. I'll never know.

after Dan.

-Let's give him a couple of minutes.
-He seemed upset.

08:47.499 --> 08:50.399
-Well. you blame him?
-Heh. well. no.

08:50.568 --> 08:55.228

to find out that your old friend....

08:56.808 --> 08:59.208
Grew breasts?

09:00.145 --> 09:03.005

and finding a man sleeping on my porch?

12:47.155 --> 12:49.175
Several times.

to me on her deathbed?

"Anybody but Jesse|."

walks into a pharmacy. and says:

"Give me some ChapStick
and put it on my bill."

-Thank you.
-Well. I mean it.
