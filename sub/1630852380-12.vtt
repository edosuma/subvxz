WEBVTT

00:06.832 --> 00:08.138
Hey, babe. Hey.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.618
I got to jump in the shower
and get to La Mirage.

00:09.661 --> 00:10.749
It's the last day of filming.

00:10.793 --> 00:11.750
Wow, I can't believe

00:11.794 --> 00:13.578
- it's already over.
- I know, right?

00:13.622 --> 00:15.058
I mean, we're still
editing and everything,

00:15.102 --> 00:18.148
but yeah,
- it really did just fly by.
- Um...

00:18.192 --> 00:19.628
What time do you think
you'll be home tonight?

00:19.671 --> 00:21.064
Ah, I mean, we're
shooting pretty late,

00:21.108 --> 00:22.587
so I was just gonna
crash at the hotel,

00:22.631 --> 00:23.762
if that's okay.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.112
But hey, how about
we celebrate

00:25.155 --> 00:26.548
the movie wrapping
tomorrow night?

00:26.591 --> 00:29.377
- Okay? Just you and me.
- Yeah.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.074
Yeah, that'll be perfect.
Just us.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.946
- We can celebrate everything.
- Okay.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.123
I can't wait.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.428
Me neither.

00:45.784 --> 00:49.440
Don't you think this
is a little excessive

00:49.484 --> 00:51.138
for just the two of us?

00:51.181 --> 00:53.444
we don't have lobster
Well, to be honest, frittatas

00:53.488 --> 00:55.533
and Golden Reserve
caviar every day,

00:55.577 --> 00:56.839
but I wanted
your first meal

00:56.882 --> 00:58.406
since moving in
to be something special.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.799
- It's delicious.
- I am so thrilled

01:00.843 --> 01:02.714
that we are finally
living under the same roof.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.151
Well, I am equally thrilled,

01:04.194 --> 01:06.153
but I am not sure
that everyone will be.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.763
Does Adam know
that I've moved in?

01:07.806 --> 01:09.721
Not unless you said something.
I haven't told him yet.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.114
Perfect.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.637
It'll be delightful
when he finds out.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.639
Hey, Adam is in a really
good place these days.

01:14.683 --> 01:15.988
He'll be fine.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.904
He's working on some
top secret wonder drug

01:18.948 --> 01:22.430
for Alexam that he claims
will take him to the next level

01:22.473 --> 01:24.432
of... something. Hmm.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.173
I wonder what
- the big secret is.
Oh, yay,

01:26.216 --> 01:28.566
lobster and caviar
for breakfast.

01:28.610 --> 01:31.134
Oh, wow,
Amanda for breakfast.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.136
Don't worry,
- I'm almost finished. Good.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.920
I don't know how early
you had to leave Alexis's

01:34.964 --> 01:36.618
just to get over here
for a free breakfast,

01:36.661 --> 01:38.837
but, uh, let's not to make a
habit out of it, all right?

01:38.881 --> 01:40.448
Well, actually, maybe
you should get used to it,

01:40.491 --> 01:41.927
seeing as how
I-I live here now.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.539
Oh, uh, could I get some more

01:44.582 --> 01:45.714
of that French jam,
please?

01:45.757 --> 01:47.019
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry, What?

01:47.063 --> 01:49.065
Oh, it is this amazing jam

01:49.109 --> 01:50.153
that they flew in from France.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.415
No, I know about the jam.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.200
- She's kidding, right?
- Of course not.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.332
It's wonderful news,
- isn't it?
- Would you like to join us?

01:55.376 --> 01:58.770
It's bad enough I have to see
you at the hospital every day.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.250
So what? You just gonna be

02:00.294 --> 02:01.599
here all the time?
Well, maybe

02:01.643 --> 02:03.166
you could move out
whenever you want.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.907
I actually think everyone
would help you pack.

02:06.474 --> 02:07.779
That's enough, both of you!

02:07.823 --> 02:09.825
- She started it.
- He started it.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.131
I'm finishing it.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.306
Now, be the adults

02:12.349 --> 02:14.482
that I know the
both of you are

02:14.525 --> 02:15.874
and please, try to get along.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.924
You're lucky he saved you.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.752
Oh, were you going to
kill me with carbs?

02:23.795 --> 02:25.710
Please.
I'm here to stay.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.236
Hey.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.803
Hey, man, welcome back.

02:33.936 --> 02:35.851
How'd it, um...
how'd it go in Venezuela?

02:35.894 --> 02:39.550
It was a rough few days.

02:39.594 --> 02:41.596
Even though I only knew
Daniel for a little while,

02:41.639 --> 02:44.033
it was still painful
to say goodbye.

02:44.076 --> 02:47.079
- Thanks for asking, buddy.
- Yeah, yeah, of course, man.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.125
I see you're still
- working on your movie.
- Yeah. We, uh,

02:49.169 --> 02:50.866
we actually finish
shooting tonight.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.128
We're filming
the final scene,

02:52.172 --> 02:53.564
when Lionel finally
wins over Farrah.

02:53.608 --> 02:54.870
I remember that
pretty well.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.219
When you made your move

02:56.263 --> 02:58.090
and basically stole
Fallon from Culhane.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.050
I didn't steal Fallon
from Culhane.

03:01.093 --> 03:03.400
Maybe Lionel didn't,
but Liam did.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.795
What are you talking about?

03:06.838 --> 03:09.232
When Liam kept manipulating
ways to get Fallon alone,

03:09.276 --> 03:10.973
and then he told her
he loved her

03:11.016 --> 03:12.583
while she was still
engaged to Culhane.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.150
And then... Okay, okay.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.065
I get it, and why do you
remember all these details?

03:16.108 --> 03:17.675
Are you writing a book
about my life?

03:17.719 --> 03:18.676
Because I already did that.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.025
What's past is past.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.853
That's why
it's called "the past."

03:21.897 --> 03:23.333
True love won,

03:23.377 --> 03:25.335
and it was clearly
the best thing for everyone.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.947
So, you're allowed
a little creative license.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.820
- That's not what's happening.
- Just forget I brought it up, okay?

03:31.863 --> 03:33.038
I'm sure
whatever you wrote

03:33.082 --> 03:35.345
is exactly
how it happened...

03:35.389 --> 03:36.433
Lionel.

03:37.826 --> 03:40.829
I'm so happy the two of you
said yes to breakfast.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.744
- It was my pleasure.
- I wasn't really sensing a choice.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.834
It is important to me that
the two most significant people

03:45.877 --> 03:47.009
in my life

03:47.052 --> 03:48.663
get to know
one another.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.621
the day off so we could be
I even gave the staff alone

03:50.665 --> 03:51.840
to connect on a deeper level.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.929
That sounds creepy.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.496
Well, I love that idea

03:55.539 --> 03:57.062
and I'm happy
to do the dishes.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.455
That is so sweet.

03:58.499 --> 03:59.978
And ridiculous.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.110
The staff will be happier
to do them tomorrow.

04:02.546 --> 04:05.027
So, Fallon, if half of
what your mother says

04:05.070 --> 04:07.290
about you is true,
you are a remarkable person.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.987
I don't think half
of what my mother says

04:09.031 --> 04:09.988
about anything is true.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.035
Fallon.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.297
You have had your face
buried in that phone

04:14.341 --> 04:15.646
since you got here.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.952
The Wordle can't
be that hard.
Hmm?

04:16.995 --> 04:19.302
Oh. No, I got some
big news this morning

04:19.346 --> 04:21.522
and I have to make
an appointment

04:21.565 --> 04:24.568
with my... accountant
to, uh, confirm it.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.787
So...
Oh.

04:25.830 --> 04:26.701
Well, I'm
not looking to

04:26.744 --> 04:28.268
overstep boundaries,

04:28.311 --> 04:30.139
but I do run a relatively
successful hedge fund.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.315
So, I know my way around
money if you need help.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.795
Mmm.
I love the boundaries.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.753
How about you stay
on your side of breakfast

04:35.797 --> 04:37.364
and I'll stay on mine?

04:37.407 --> 04:38.495
Maybe we should do
this another time. No.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.018
Ooh, agreed.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.759
Let's pencil something
in for two months from now.

04:41.803 --> 04:45.546
That way, I can easily erase
it when you are no longer around.

04:45.589 --> 04:46.677
I'm sorry, but he feels
a little more

04:46.721 --> 04:48.897
boy toy than boyfriend
right now.

04:48.940 --> 04:49.898
Fallon Morell Carrington...

04:49.941 --> 04:51.029
Oh, that's fine.
You can be

04:51.073 --> 04:52.466
mad at me,
but I'm the only one

04:52.509 --> 04:54.032
looking out for you.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.512
I know guys like him,
and I know you.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.558
You two will be bored
of each other in two weeks.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.606
Well, that was worse
than expected.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.826
I think I'm going to go.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.349
No, Dex, please.
I don't want you to leave.

05:06.393 --> 05:09.134
I think it's for the best.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.398
I spent a winter in Antarctica
and it wasn't this cold.

05:11.441 --> 05:14.488
Well, maybe we could
have dinner tonight?

05:14.531 --> 05:17.534
I promise, Fallon
will not be there.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.580
I'm flying out of town
tomorrow and I have a lot to do.

05:19.623 --> 05:23.018
Tell Fallon I said goodbye.
If she notices I'm gone.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.503
I've been looking for you.

05:29.546 --> 05:32.114
I did not think
to look in my chair.

05:32.157 --> 05:35.422
final details for the airport
Just, uh, going over some opening.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.380
I can't believe it's
only two weeks away.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.077
I'm so excited

05:39.121 --> 05:41.384
that we're doing this
together, as equal partners.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.038
I can feel the corporate
tycoon energy

05:43.081 --> 05:45.170
- racing through my veins.
- Well, I don't want to be

05:45.214 --> 05:47.303
a blood clot,
but I have some bad news.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.613
We failed yesterday's
inspection,

05:52.656 --> 05:54.528
because our radar tower
wasn't up to code.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.312
- So now what?
- Well, if we don't get

05:56.356 --> 05:57.531
proper certification
this week,

05:57.574 --> 05:59.359
we'll have to postpone
our opening.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.970
Flores board is breathing down
No, we can't do that. The
my neck

06:02.013 --> 06:04.407
to prove that their sizable
investment in the merger

06:04.451 --> 06:05.539
was worth the risk.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.105
Well, I can try
to grease some palms,

06:07.149 --> 06:10.413
but most of them are currently
giving me the middle finger.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.982
I'll look into some
possible solutions as well.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.898
I didn't realize that you knew
people that build radar towers.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.161
I don't know people
who build radar towers.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.380
But I need our airport

06:20.423 --> 06:22.730
to open on schedule,
so I will find some.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.908
Well, thank you for
squeezing me in.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.953
Okay, I'll see you
this afternoon.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.478
Whoa!

06:31.521 --> 06:33.131
Why are you all up
in my face?

06:33.175 --> 06:34.611
Also, you should call

06:34.655 --> 06:36.483
Dr. Gellar and have that
frown line taken care of.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.354
Where's your
gentleman caller?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.487
Dex left because of
your bitchy attitude.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.749
I told you

06:41.792 --> 06:43.098
I was too busy for
breakfast this morning.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.273
I have a lot going on

06:44.316 --> 06:45.143
and there was something
that I needed

06:45.187 --> 06:46.449
- to take care of.
- Like what?

06:46.493 --> 06:47.581
Like...

06:47.624 --> 06:48.712
I don't like
your vibe right now,

06:48.756 --> 06:50.192
so maybe
it's not a good time.

06:50.235 --> 06:51.672
Oh, you are impossible.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.064
You know,
I need to go find Dex

06:53.108 --> 06:55.197
and apologize
before he leaves town.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.633
Good, don't let me stop you.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.549
Hi, there.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.464
We're here to service
your refrigerator?

07:01.508 --> 07:03.640
Oh, right. Freon leak?

07:03.684 --> 07:06.077
Actually, what is freon?
I read it was dangerous.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.427
Or was that radon?
No, it's freon.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.124
Freon is the dangerous one.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.518
Be quiet and nobody gets hurt.

07:12.823 --> 07:16.914
Looks like freon is the least
of our worries right now.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.927
I have a bad feeling
about this.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.799
I would rather try to bribe

07:31.842 --> 07:34.671
the Governor of Georgia,
who I know hates me,

07:34.715 --> 07:36.630
- than come here for help.
- I've done the research.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.632
This is our only shot
to fix the radar tower

07:38.675 --> 07:39.807
without delays.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.243
Unless you have
another solution

07:41.286 --> 07:43.854
- you're not telling me about.
- No. No, I don't.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.335
But since we're here,
just let me do all the talking.

07:47.597 --> 07:51.383
Huh, Blake, Cristal.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.299
Nice to see you.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.606
I'd say I'm sorry
to have kept you waiting,

07:56.650 --> 07:58.478
but you two left my husband
and I waiting naked

07:58.521 --> 08:00.523
in a hotel room,
so I'm not that sorry.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.916
You're right.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.353
We should have said
something before we left.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.268
We were intrigued

08:06.311 --> 08:09.837
by your offer for a joint
experience together,

08:09.880 --> 08:12.883
but got nervous
and handled it poorly.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.494
I guess I shouldn't be
that surprised.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.366
Blake was much more
bark than bite in college.

08:17.409 --> 08:20.500
Though we really were into
some biting that night.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.066
Okay, Sonya.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.546
I think you've milked
the awkwardness enough.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.505
Can we just get on with it?

08:25.548 --> 08:26.462
We know that your company

08:26.506 --> 08:28.203
does large-scale
electrical work,

08:28.246 --> 08:30.858
including building and
installing radar towers.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.555
Now, we don't need
a new one built,

08:32.599 --> 08:35.166
but we do need one brought up
to code... in a week.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.081
All right.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.561
Henry and I
would be glad to help.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.129
- Great.
- But if you need it that fast,

08:41.172 --> 08:42.826
it's gonna come
with a mark-up.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.045
How much?

08:44.088 --> 08:45.350
300 percent.

08:45.394 --> 08:46.917
What?! Are you insane?

08:46.961 --> 08:49.180
Oh, this is just punishment
for us not biting.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.226
Believe me, I would love
to punish you, Blake.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.489
And if you'd stayed
that night, you'd know.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.099
But this is business.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.797
And rush jobs are costly.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.626
Look, why don't you guys
take the day to think about
it?

08:59.669 --> 09:00.975
The day?

09:01.018 --> 09:04.108
And then,
come to our house tonight

09:04.152 --> 09:07.111
for a little party
and we can talk.

09:07.155 --> 09:10.724
It's going to be a wonderful
evening of fun and games.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.424
<i>All we want</i>

09:15.467 --> 09:16.643
is the jewelry
you got from Cartier.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.296
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.560
You posted your shopping trip
on your social media feed

09:20.603 --> 09:21.865
and narrated the whole thing.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.301
You did what?

09:23.345 --> 09:24.607
Have you learned nothing
from the Kardashians?

09:24.651 --> 09:26.261
My followers expect
bold content.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.263
I don't post boring pictures
of my feet by the pool.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.656
Okay, well,
maybe if you did,

09:29.699 --> 09:31.440
we wouldn't have a gun
pointed at us right now.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.485
Shut your mouths.
This isn't couples therapy.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.226
Give me your phones
and get on the floor.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.619
Tie their hands
behind their backs.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.012
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.230
I have a lot going on,

09:39.274 --> 09:40.971
so will you just let me know

09:41.015 --> 09:42.930
if I get any calls or texts?

09:47.238 --> 09:48.196
Okay.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.284
So here's the thing...

09:53.680 --> 09:55.507
- Follow me!
- Whoa.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.689
<i>Why are you here</i> <i>
and when are you leaving?</i>

10:02.732 --> 10:04.778
The hospital's
insurance carrier

10:04.821 --> 10:06.736
needs the legal department
to review these cases

10:06.780 --> 10:09.304
to make sure they're
consistent with recent changes

10:09.347 --> 10:10.348
in insurance law.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.393
Shouldn't take you too long.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.178
You're slamming me with
needless busywork.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.310
How juvenile.

10:15.353 --> 10:16.746
How you.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.182
You know,

10:18.226 --> 10:20.271
you may be
untouchable at home,

10:20.315 --> 10:21.751
but here at the hospital,

10:21.795 --> 10:23.492
I'm chief of staff,
and I make the rules.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.842
So if you don't want to play
by them, you can just quit.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.496
It really would make
life more pleasurable

10:27.539 --> 10:28.976
for the both of us.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.194
Or maybe just me.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.631
You're very funny.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.154
And quite sad.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.938
But, um...
I absolutely won't quit

10:34.982 --> 10:36.766
and I can handle anything
you throw at me.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.028
So... Oh, sister,

10:38.072 --> 10:39.421
you haven't even
seen me throw yet.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.205
Bring the rest in.

10:46.602 --> 10:47.951
You cannot be serious.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.129
Well,

10:52.173 --> 10:53.522
I should let you
get back to work.

10:53.565 --> 10:54.958
You have a lot on your plate.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.656
<i>There is no way</i>

10:56.699 --> 10:59.876
we are attending Sonya
and Henry's "night of fun,"

10:59.920 --> 11:02.052
which is obviously just
their way of saying "orgy."

11:02.096 --> 11:03.445
We are out of options, Blake.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.055
Either we go to the party
or we postpone

11:05.099 --> 11:06.709
the airport opening,
which we can't afford to do.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.015
I don't care.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.407
I am done with
those two hedonists.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.887
We don't have
to have sex with them

11:10.931 --> 11:12.541
to get a better price.
We just have to show up.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.022
Sonya is challenging us
to see if we're scared.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.023
It's all a mind game.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.199
Besides...

11:18.242 --> 11:22.769
I have been dying to wear
this new outfit.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.249
And Sexfest 2022 seems like
the perfect place for it.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.468
I have a better idea.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.861
Why don't you put
that on here

11:27.904 --> 11:30.733
and then I will eagerly
take it off of you.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.387
Interesting.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.606
I'll put it on for you,

11:34.650 --> 11:37.479
but you can't take it off
until we get to the orgy.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.656
I'm kidding.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.440
But wear something
super sexy just in case.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.921
We don't want to stand out
for the wrong reasons.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.837
<i>We'll be safe in here.</i>

11:47.881 --> 11:49.056
It's my panic room.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.014
Did you say panic room
or day spa?

11:51.058 --> 11:53.321
What? I installed all
the essentials in case

11:53.364 --> 11:54.975
I ever needed to seek refuge.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.890
I wanted to put in a hot tub,
but the condo board

11:56.933 --> 11:58.456
- was completely unyielding.
- Okay, so I'm just curious.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.241
Now that you have
locked us in here,

12:00.284 --> 12:01.633
how and when
do we get out?

12:01.677 --> 12:02.722
Easy.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.072
I push this security button

12:05.115 --> 12:06.769
which sounds the alarm
and calls the police.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.250
Butch and Sundance out there
will realize they need to leave

12:09.293 --> 12:11.469
and we can walk out
when they do.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.085
Please tell me
it's a silent alarm.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.695
It is not.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.001
I know you're in there.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.350
Very clever.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.352
That's right.
The police have been called

12:24.395 --> 12:26.267
and are on their way.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.747
We cut the phone wires

12:27.790 --> 12:30.140
as soon as we got here,
so the police are not coming.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.229
Especially since
we have your phones.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.797
And we're not leaving
until we get what we came for.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.581
So tell us where
the jewelry is...

12:36.625 --> 12:38.714
...or settle in
while we search the place. Tell them.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.629
No.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.936
Okay, your funeral.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.815
I'll only need a minute

12:52.859 --> 12:54.295
of the chief of staff's
valuable time.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.818
Come in.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.778
If you've come to resign,
I will need it in writing.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.083
Uh... No, you know,

13:00.127 --> 13:01.519
verbal will be fine.
You know what?

13:01.563 --> 13:03.783
Just a simple head nod
and we're good.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.654
You've misdiagnosed
the situation, Doctor.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.135
As usual. I'm not quitting.

13:08.178 --> 13:11.225
- Then get out.
- Unfortunately, there has been a leak

13:11.268 --> 13:13.575
in the confidential
hospital files, so,

13:13.618 --> 13:14.794
Legal is gonna
need to check

13:14.837 --> 13:16.317
every computer to
determine the culprit.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.146
No need. Obviously,
I would never do such a thing.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.800
Don't touch my computer.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.368
Uh, I'm sure that you're
telling the truth.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.630
I mean, there is

13:25.674 --> 13:26.806
obviously a first time
for everything. But

13:26.849 --> 13:28.242
we'll snatch it up
anyway to make sure

13:28.285 --> 13:29.983
- you're not hiding anything.
- This is preposterous.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.375
You can't do this.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.116
Well, you can
take it up with Legal.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.075
Oh, wait, that's me.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.598
Motion denied.

13:36.641 --> 13:37.904
Shall we?

13:44.475 --> 13:47.739
You what? That pressing
is getting really annoying.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.611
And I am starting to feel
a little claustrophobic in here.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.352
Come on.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.006
Hey, Instagram star,
we haven't found...

13:53.049 --> 13:55.008
...the jewelry,
but we did find your safe.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.488
So, combination, please?

13:57.532 --> 14:01.144
Sure, left, go to hell,
right, choke on it.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.233
What is the matter with you?

14:03.277 --> 14:05.888
No piece of jewelry is worth
getting killed over.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.586
Easy for you to say
- when it's not your jewelry.
- You know what?

14:08.630 --> 14:10.762
On second thought, maybe
it's better if I do getkilled.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.939
That way, I won't have
to spend another hour

14:12.982 --> 14:14.984
in this room with someone
as selfish as you.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.899
I am your mother.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.945
Are there no bounds
to your rudeness?

14:20.163 --> 14:21.512
Fine.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.689
07, 24, 08.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.343
What is that?

14:26.387 --> 14:27.954
The date I divorced
your father.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.607
Oh, that's charming.

14:29.651 --> 14:33.307
So, which bottle of wine
pairs best with a home
invasion?

14:33.350 --> 14:35.048
- Not in the mood to drink.
- Wow.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.876
That's the first time I've
ever heard you said that.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.619
But the more I think about it,

14:41.663 --> 14:43.273
I don't think
I'm gonna drink, either.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.927
Hey.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.582
There's nothing in the safe
but costume jewelry.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.192
Tell us where
the real piece is.

14:49.236 --> 14:50.846
Over my dead body!

14:50.890 --> 14:52.021
All right.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.675
Just to be clear, she said

14:53.718 --> 14:55.677
over her dead body, not mine.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.722
We're not leaving without
what we came for.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.072
We need to get
out of here,

14:59.115 --> 15:00.682
I have a crucial

15:00.725 --> 15:02.597
appointment this afternoon
that I cannot miss.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.294
Oh, you think
I don't need to leave?

15:04.338 --> 15:06.383
I need to go find Dex
and apologize before he leaves

15:06.427 --> 15:07.863
the country
for the next three weeks.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.734
I am not telling
them a thing!

15:09.778 --> 15:11.388
What do you think
is gonna happen?

15:11.432 --> 15:12.607
Do you think that the robbers
are just gonna get bored

15:12.650 --> 15:14.000
and they're gonna move on?

15:14.043 --> 15:15.392
Or do you think that
they've booked another

15:15.436 --> 15:16.872
home invasion appointment
on a different floor?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.395
They'll leave if they think
the police are coming.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.527
But they know that
the police aren't coming.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.226
Well, then we need
to fix that, don't we?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.056
Everybody got my
rewritten scene, right?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.579
Uh, yeah,

15:28.623 --> 15:31.147
we all got them... But?

15:31.191 --> 15:33.236
But Nina wants to shoot
it the way that it was.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.585
That's not gonna to happen.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.065
UH, you can take
it up with Nina,

15:36.109 --> 15:38.372
but I don't think
she's gonna change her mind.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.765
Which one do you like better?
The old one or the new one?

15:40.809 --> 15:42.245
I'm just the producer.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.291
Okay, my job is to keep
things on schedule

15:44.334 --> 15:45.727
and not go over budget.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.033
So if Nina wants to
shoot it this way,

15:47.076 --> 15:48.208
then I'm perfectly
fine with that.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.687
Yeah, of course you are.
All right,

15:49.731 --> 15:50.906
maybe you don't
like the rewrite

15:50.950 --> 15:52.125
because Cutler is
acting super shady

15:52.168 --> 15:54.083
and unworthy of Farrah's love.

15:54.127 --> 15:57.695
Which is clearly why
she runs to Lionel.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.001
Okay.

15:59.045 --> 16:02.135
If it were up to me,
which it is not,

16:02.178 --> 16:03.963
I would say we shoot
the good version,

16:04.006 --> 16:05.834
which is the original.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.402
Like I said, you can
take it up with Nina,

16:08.445 --> 16:09.969
but she wants
to shoot this one.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.759
Now what're you gonna shoot?

16:17.802 --> 16:19.021
Very mature,

16:19.065 --> 16:20.153
but you know we have
other copies.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.241
It was symbolic.

16:24.722 --> 16:25.985
Let's get this over with.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.682
Relax, we're
gonna be fine.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.205
And you look hot.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.381
Well, thank you,
but remember, we agreed.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.687
We're not getting involved

16:32.730 --> 16:34.515
in any of Sonya's
sex-crazed fantasies.

16:34.558 --> 16:35.690
The second someone
asks for lubricant,

16:35.733 --> 16:36.778
we are out the door.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.609
Uh-oh.

16:41.652 --> 16:42.871
What the hell?

16:42.914 --> 16:44.003
I think we're
a little undressed.

16:44.046 --> 16:48.050
Welcome to our night of fun.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.400
I love what you're
both wearing.

16:50.444 --> 16:53.447
Makes me wish I was wearing
a little less.

16:54.274 --> 16:57.668
We thought...
Never mind.

16:57.712 --> 16:58.626
SONYA:Great.

16:58.669 --> 16:59.888
So, game night's
about to start.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.803
Shall we make our way
to the living room?

17:14.163 --> 17:16.209
Hello.
Kirby. Hi!

17:16.252 --> 17:17.427
Welcome home.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.125
Thank you so much for coming.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.996
I got your text when I got
off the plane from Milan

17:21.040 --> 17:22.563
and came straight here.
I really appreciate it.

17:25.261 --> 17:28.003
I'm assuming you want
to talk about the, uh...

17:28.047 --> 17:29.831
the kiss, right?

17:30.875 --> 17:33.878
Well, I mean, you're
with Charlie, so we can just

17:33.922 --> 17:35.271
forget that ever happened.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.012
Okay...

17:38.144 --> 17:39.449
So what do you
need me for, then?

17:39.493 --> 17:40.929
I hope it has nothing to do

17:40.972 --> 17:42.757
with the mountains
of paper in here.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.063
'Cause, technically,
I didn't finish high school.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.629
Well, actually,

17:45.673 --> 17:47.414
it is related, 'cause Adam
is trying to bury me

17:47.457 --> 17:48.806
so that I quit or am fired.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.330
So, I need to fight back.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.810
He's working on this new
top secret drug project

17:52.854 --> 17:55.117
and I found these cryptic
exchanges on his computer

17:55.161 --> 17:56.814
between him and
the Customs Commissioner,

17:56.858 --> 17:58.816
and also certain Google
searches which imply

17:58.860 --> 18:00.644
that he has imported
a drug illegally.

18:00.688 --> 18:03.082
Okay, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
I'm still on Italy time.

18:04.474 --> 18:05.780
You hacked his computer?

18:05.823 --> 18:07.738
Well, no, no,
I'm not Jeff Colby.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.610
But I had security take it.

18:09.653 --> 18:10.915
I mean, I had my suspicions

18:10.959 --> 18:12.439
that he was doing
something illegal.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.441
I mean, considering
he stole his last formula

18:14.484 --> 18:15.616
from the other doctor,
but this...

18:15.659 --> 18:17.357
this is way worse
than I imagined.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.925
I'm still waiting
- for the me part.
- Right.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.928
Um, I'm hoping that you
could go and talk to Adam

18:23.972 --> 18:26.148
in his lab and,
you know, find out what

18:26.192 --> 18:28.150
and where this
illegal substance is.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.239
<i>Altolà, altol.</i>

18:30.283 --> 18:33.155
You want me to spy
on my ex-boyfriend?

18:33.199 --> 18:35.331
That's why you texted me?

18:35.375 --> 18:37.072
<i>Siì?</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:38.813
This sibling feud is
ridiculous and out of control,

18:38.856 --> 18:40.510
and I don't want
any part of it.

18:40.554 --> 18:43.078
But if Adam gets his way,
I... I could be deported.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.602
And-and-and
I could lose my job

18:45.646 --> 18:47.256
and be forced
to go back to the UK.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.086
Well, I don't want to see you
get deported.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.348
Me neither.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.308
Fine.

18:55.351 --> 18:56.831
I'll see what
I can find out.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.354
But I'm not
promising anything.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.574
Of course not.
I really appreciate it.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.185
This is the night of fun
and games?

19:03.229 --> 19:04.839
Looks like fun to me.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.015
Getting that radar
tower deal done

19:07.058 --> 19:08.408
is business, not fun.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.757
I didn't come here
to play kids' games.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.106
No.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.455
It looks like you both
are dressed

19:12.499 --> 19:14.414
to play adult games,
if you ask me.

19:14.457 --> 19:15.850
Is Henry around?

19:15.893 --> 19:17.678
While you guys are
playing candy cones,

19:17.721 --> 19:19.419
maybe he and I
can hash out a deal.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.594
Henry's around somewhere.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.378
But what if there's
an opportunity

19:22.422 --> 19:25.207
right here for you to get
what you want.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.861
Yeah? Well, how many people
- do I have to sleep with?
- Blake.

19:26.904 --> 19:30.386
One game. You win, you get
your tower at cost,

19:30.430 --> 19:32.171
plus two years
of free maintenance.

19:32.214 --> 19:36.044
I win, you pay me
400 percent over cost.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.524
The price went up?

19:37.567 --> 19:39.265
What's the game?

19:39.308 --> 19:44.008
Well, I like high stakes
mind games.

19:44.052 --> 19:47.360
But they're not
for everyone.

19:47.403 --> 19:50.972
I thrive on high stakes
mind games.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.757
What is it, huh?

19:53.801 --> 19:56.282
Liar's Poker?

19:56.325 --> 19:58.240
Ace tres?

20:00.416 --> 20:02.026
Murder?

20:02.070 --> 20:04.377
Rock Paper Scissors.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.205
Are you sure about this?

20:06.248 --> 20:08.337
Nobody outsmarts
Blake Carrington.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.253
Let's do this.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.254
I'm ready to rock.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.735
Or am I ready to scissor?

20:16.867 --> 20:17.955
Patience.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.523
Let me explain
how we do it here.

20:20.567 --> 20:24.266
We use gold, silk,
and katana swords.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.572
Gold bashes katana.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.748
Katana slices silk.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.619
And silk covers gold.

20:29.663 --> 20:32.535
And the winner gets
to keep the gold.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.668
Would you, uh,
give us a second?

20:35.843 --> 20:37.845
Sonya's choosing the sword.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.368
She'd feel more powerful
slicing with it.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.630
She probably knows

20:40.674 --> 20:41.762
you're telling me
that right now.

20:41.805 --> 20:42.937
No, I've got this, okay?

20:42.980 --> 20:44.199
I've known her
way longer than you.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.635
But I know how she thinks.

20:49.726 --> 20:50.858
Let's do this.

20:53.730 --> 20:56.777
Rock. Paper. Scissors.
Rock. Paper. Scissors.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.431
Ha!

21:03.871 --> 21:05.176
I win.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.221
You lose.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.353
Thanks for coming.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.974
Is now really the time
to celebrate with some wine?

21:20.017 --> 21:21.236
I thought you and
I were coming up

21:21.280 --> 21:22.977
with a plan
to get these guys out of here.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.587
No one is having wine.
This is the plan.

21:24.631 --> 21:25.936
Come on, help me move this.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.810
Is this really a plan

21:29.853 --> 21:31.551
or am I just
- helping you redecorate?
- Here.

21:31.594 --> 21:34.510
Okay. Now, crank
the tanning bed up to high.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.512
But, like, bacon-crisper high.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.471
And then, with a little luck,
it will trigger the alarm

21:38.514 --> 21:40.342
- on the wine fridge.
- And then, what?

21:40.386 --> 21:41.517
The wine police will come?

21:41.561 --> 21:44.128
Oh, we can play the alarm

21:44.172 --> 21:45.434
over the intercom.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.001
And they'll think we got
the alarm going again.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.655
But what if they know
it's not the police alarm?

21:48.698 --> 21:49.917
You think these idiots
know the difference?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.005
I'm pretty sure
they don't own

21:51.048 --> 21:53.094
a $25,000 wine fridge.

21:53.137 --> 21:56.140
Why do you have a $25,000
wine fridge in your panic
room?

21:56.184 --> 21:57.228
Mmm.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.668
Crap! We got to go.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.800
Just grab what you can.

22:06.499 --> 22:09.458
Hello?
Mr. Robbers?

22:09.502 --> 22:10.938
I'll tell you where
the diamond is now.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.853
Hello?

22:15.029 --> 22:17.379
- They're gone.
- I have to say,

22:17.423 --> 22:19.599
- I am very impressed with you.
- Mmm.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.340
Now, let's get the hell
out of here.

22:26.997 --> 22:30.044
Is there some secret way
to open this thing?

22:30.087 --> 22:32.742
It's a door, Fallon. No.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.399
- Uh-oh.
- What "uh-oh"?

22:37.443 --> 22:40.228
The door and the phone
must use the same power source,

22:40.271 --> 22:42.970
which they cut,
so we're locked in.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.493
Now I'm less
impressed with you.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.413
Woo!

22:51.457 --> 22:52.675
Hey, stranger.

22:52.719 --> 22:54.198
Stranger is right.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.026
What are you doing
- here, Kirby?
- My iPad died

22:56.070 --> 22:57.506
on my flight back from Milan,

22:57.550 --> 22:59.073
and I just...
I don't know.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.770
I just wanted to check in,

23:00.814 --> 23:02.511
make sure our friendship
is still solid.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.165
That's so thoughtful.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.385
But the timing is odd,

23:06.428 --> 23:09.170
considering the fact that
we're not really friendsanymore.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.867
So, if you don't mind...

23:10.911 --> 23:12.478
Right, you're busy.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.697
I can feel the science
happening in here.

23:14.741 --> 23:17.657
Are you working on something
new and exciting?

23:17.700 --> 23:20.921
I am developing
an antiaging injectable

23:20.964 --> 23:22.966
which is going to be revolutionary.

23:23.010 --> 23:26.100
That sounds amazing. Is there
a, uh, secret ingredient?

23:26.143 --> 23:27.188
Indeed there is.

23:30.626 --> 23:31.584
It's in these bottles?

23:31.627 --> 23:33.107
Yeah.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.115
What is it?

23:41.158 --> 23:44.074
You promise not
to tell anyone?

23:44.118 --> 23:45.598
Of course I promise.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.687
Okay, but this
stays between us.

23:47.730 --> 23:48.992
All right?

23:49.036 --> 23:50.733
The secret ingredient

23:50.777 --> 23:54.868
is a tropical plant called
"how stupid do you think I
am?"

23:54.911 --> 23:55.999
Oh.

23:56.043 --> 23:57.697
That was...

23:57.740 --> 24:01.048
It was for me,
not the name.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.050
Somebody sent you here
- to spy on me.
- What?

24:03.093 --> 24:04.965
You're being paranoid,
silly Billy.

24:05.008 --> 24:07.054
God, you are not a good spy.
Um, so, who sent you?

24:07.097 --> 24:09.535
- Jeff? Alexis?
- Wow.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.058
You really do have
a lot of enemies.

24:11.101 --> 24:13.016
So it's neither
of those, so...

24:14.714 --> 24:15.802
Was it Amanda?

24:16.803 --> 24:19.806
Kirby, why are you
working for that monster?

24:19.849 --> 24:20.807
Monster?

24:20.850 --> 24:21.851
Amanda isn't the monster.

24:21.895 --> 24:22.939
You're the one
trying to fire her

24:22.983 --> 24:24.332
and get her deported.

24:24.375 --> 24:28.249
Uh, first of all,
I can't fire her.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.293
And even if I could,

24:29.337 --> 24:31.513
her visa isn't
connected to her job.

24:31.557 --> 24:34.473
She has American parents.
So she can't get deported.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.171
So she lied to manipulate
you to do this.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.955
So who's the monster?

24:40.696 --> 24:42.089
<i>Oh, did you speak to Adam?</i>

24:42.132 --> 24:44.004
Yes, and we need to talk.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.701
Oh, I know. I've been dying
to call you,

24:45.745 --> 24:46.920
but I didn't want to just
in case you were still with him.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.487
So, did you find out anything?

24:48.530 --> 24:50.924
Uh, well, I found out
the secret ingredient

24:50.967 --> 24:52.926
he uses is locked in
a high-tech refrigerator.

24:53.927 --> 24:55.450
Is that it or...

24:55.494 --> 24:58.105
- is there anything else?
- I learned that you're a liar

24:58.148 --> 25:00.542
who tried to manipulate me
by making me feel bad for you.

25:00.586 --> 25:03.240
I also learned that your
visa has nothing to do

25:03.284 --> 25:05.112
with your job, and, yeah,

25:05.155 --> 25:06.505
- I think that was about it.
- Look,

25:06.548 --> 25:08.115
I'm-I-m so sorry,
Kirby. I-I...

25:08.158 --> 25:10.552
I shouldn't have said that.
I was panicking

25:10.596 --> 25:13.294
and I needed help
and it kind of came out.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.035
Mmm, yeah. Well,
even if I believed you

25:15.078 --> 25:16.471
which I don't,

25:16.515 --> 25:17.994
it's nothing compared to
what you did to me

25:18.038 --> 25:19.169
the night I left for Milan.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.868
Uh, I'm sorry,
what I did to you?

25:21.911 --> 25:25.001
From what I recall,
you're the one that kissed me.

25:25.045 --> 25:26.699
Only because you were
going on and on about

25:26.742 --> 25:29.876
how you had these feelings
for me and I was confused.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.356
But I'm done with
your stupid feud with Adam.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.316
I have had enough drama
with him. And you.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.752
Oh.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.319
And I did learn
one more thing tonight.

25:38.362 --> 25:41.191
Kissing you was
a huge mistake.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.291
Did you just bring me
in here to humiliate me

25:54.335 --> 25:55.858
in the weirdest way possible?

25:55.902 --> 25:59.470
No. I was testing a theory
about my instincts.

25:59.514 --> 26:00.515
And I was right.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.126
They're great. Kudos.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.650
Glad I could help.

26:04.693 --> 26:05.912
The problem is that Blake

26:05.955 --> 26:07.261
didn't trust
my instincts tonight,

26:07.304 --> 26:08.436
so now we're stuck
with a horrible deal

26:08.479 --> 26:10.046
for the radar tower.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.309
He refuses to pay Sonya's
price, meaning that the opening

26:12.353 --> 26:14.355
of our airport
will definitely be delayed.

26:14.398 --> 26:17.010
I didn't understand
about 50 percent

26:17.053 --> 26:18.620
of what you just said to me,

26:18.664 --> 26:20.796
but I can relate to having
a difficult business partner.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.189
Alexis?

26:22.232 --> 26:24.017
I'm pretty sure everyone
saw that one coming.

26:24.060 --> 26:27.237
Yeah, and I'm busting my ass
trying to fund a project

26:27.281 --> 26:29.022
at Alexam just to get
her approval.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.327
Why are you self-funding?

26:30.371 --> 26:31.851
You and Alexis
are on good terms.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.200
We're on great terms

26:33.243 --> 26:35.594
and technically,
we're partners, but...

26:37.030 --> 26:38.727
...she has all the power,
I guess.

26:38.771 --> 26:41.556
It's like you and Blake.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.123
Only one of you
has real control.

26:46.866 --> 26:49.564
I haven't really
looked at it that way.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.000
Thank you, Adam.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.307
Oh, I didn't know I was
being helpful, but sure.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.358
I'm not an electrician,
but I'm pretty sure

27:01.402 --> 27:03.665
the power to the door
won't just turn on.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.886
This cannot be happening.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.758
What about Liam?
Won't he wonder where you are?

27:09.802 --> 27:11.107
He'll come here,

27:11.151 --> 27:12.587
turn the power on
and let us out.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.807
No, no. Liam's spending
the night at La Mirage.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.896
Oh...

27:16.939 --> 27:18.506
Another big fight?
Makes sense.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.465
What? No. We're great.

27:21.509 --> 27:24.599
And we're about
to be even greater.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.340
He's just... he's
spending the night there

27:26.383 --> 27:27.907
because he's shooting the
movie and it makes more sense

27:27.950 --> 27:29.735
for him to stay
- there than come home.
- Right.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.171
Sure. Okay.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.303
Well, Dex won't be
looking for me

27:33.347 --> 27:35.088
- because he's leaving town.
- Yes, yes.

27:35.131 --> 27:36.611
I know. You've told me
about 90 times.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.613
No need to snap.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.180
I'm just saying
we are trapped here tonight

27:40.223 --> 27:42.269
until my staff comes
in the morning.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.187
At least they didn't
get this.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.799
I could kill you.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.889
I should kill you.
You've had that the whole
time?

27:53.933 --> 27:56.805
You could've given that to
them and we would be out of here.

27:56.849 --> 27:59.112
But you care about possessions
more than you care about people.

27:59.155 --> 28:01.331
Some things never change.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.594
If you'd let me explain... No, I'm not gonna
let you do anything.

28:03.638 --> 28:05.379
I may be stuck here with you,
but that doesn't mean

28:05.422 --> 28:07.294
I have to look at you
or hear you.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.210
Fallon, uh...

28:12.908 --> 28:14.127
Good night.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.484
Picking up some extra cash?

28:23.527 --> 28:25.878
I'm just
trying to help out

28:25.921 --> 28:27.444
where I can.
You know, I can't help it.

28:27.488 --> 28:28.794
I'm a giver.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.752
So principal
photography is over.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.798
Does it always go by
- so quickly?
- Pretty much.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.843
These indie shoots
just fly by.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.453
It's funny that
you mention that.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.718
I was thinking,

28:39.761 --> 28:42.068
maybe we slow things
down just a bit.

28:42.111 --> 28:44.766
You know, shoot my version
- of the scene from last night.
- Liam,

28:44.810 --> 28:46.725
you can bring me breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.335
It's not gonna change the fact
that we already wrapped.

28:48.378 --> 28:51.251
Yeah, but have you considered
maybe unwrapping?

28:51.294 --> 28:52.600
That's not a thing.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.689
And I heard about
your tantrum last night,

28:54.733 --> 28:56.343
which sounded wildly unprofessional.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.780
Okay, that was just
frustration with Culhane

28:58.824 --> 29:00.173
for not supporting my vision.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.349
We need to show
the audience that Lionel

29:02.392 --> 29:05.744
didn't steal
Farrah from Cutler.

29:05.787 --> 29:09.269
The story works great
as it is, unless...

29:09.312 --> 29:12.315
This has nothing to do with
showing the audience anything,

29:12.359 --> 29:14.840
but is really about you
showing Culhane

29:14.883 --> 29:16.363
you weren't
the real-life villain.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.581
I-I mean...

29:17.625 --> 29:19.453
I assume you two talked
about this.

29:19.496 --> 29:20.976
It's obviously
not the kind of thing

29:21.020 --> 29:23.065
you just ignore and pretend
like it never happened.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.894
No.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.548
Yeah, never.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.332
I don't know, I figured
it was ancient history.

29:29.376 --> 29:30.899
Of course. I forgot.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.814
You're men, who don't talk,
which is why

29:32.858 --> 29:36.122
it's not historical,
but very, very current.

29:40.517 --> 29:43.303
Hello? Is anyone here yet?
Hello?

29:45.609 --> 29:46.915
Oh.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.090
Breakfast?

29:49.613 --> 29:51.702
Caviar-infused protein bar?

29:51.746 --> 29:53.226
FALLON:I never

29:53.269 --> 29:55.576
want to hear the word
breakfast ever again.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.752
We wouldn't be trapped
in here right now

29:57.796 --> 29:59.145
if you hadn't insisted
I have breakfast

29:59.188 --> 30:00.755
with your latest boy toy.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.452
You need to stop
- calling him that.
- Oh, I know.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.106
I know, he's not a boy,

30:04.150 --> 30:06.848
but man toy doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.459
He's not any kind of toy.
He's special to me.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.374
That's why I wanted
the two of you to bond.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.202
And because...

30:15.074 --> 30:16.597
well, I was going
to propose to him

30:16.640 --> 30:17.946
before he left town.

30:18.904 --> 30:19.948
With this ring.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.560
That's why I
- wouldn't give it up.
- Fine.

30:23.604 --> 30:26.259
That almost makes
sense, but...

30:26.302 --> 30:28.870
I mean, why did you have
to propose to him last night?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.916
You just met the guy,
not counting, you know,

30:30.959 --> 30:33.614
when he had a crush
on you 20 years ago.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.921
Why couldn't you have just
waited till he got back in
town?

30:35.964 --> 30:37.096
I love Dex.

30:38.053 --> 30:39.098
I do.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.623
But I'm afraid
I'm going to lose him,

30:42.666 --> 30:45.756
like I lose everyone
who's important to me.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.758
You've come and gone.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.979
Amanda moved out.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.329
Jeff is too busy for me.

30:55.549 --> 30:56.898
What if I end up alone?

30:56.942 --> 30:58.291
You can't marry someone

30:58.334 --> 31:00.510
just because
you're afraid to be alone.

31:00.554 --> 31:02.904
You'll still be alone,
just with the other person.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.082
Dex is the only one
that I've got now.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.171
And...

31:09.215 --> 31:10.825
I was hoping to
make us forever

31:10.869 --> 31:12.696
before he had second thoughts.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.135
But he's gone now, so...

31:17.136 --> 31:19.747
When we get out of here,
I need to get on a plane

31:19.790 --> 31:21.357
and go find him.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.446
This can't all be for nothing.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.930
I'm here to renegotiate.
You can't renegotiate

31:28.974 --> 31:30.497
just because you
don't like the terms.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.326
That was Blake's deal.

31:33.369 --> 31:34.718
I'm here to make my own.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.069
With you. Woman to woman.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.420
I don't feel incentivized.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.552
Although, we could
play a game for it.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.380
This isn't a game.
It's my business.

31:44.424 --> 31:46.730
And I know your company
is the only one

31:46.774 --> 31:48.819
that can do this
for us in time.

31:48.863 --> 31:51.822
But I expect you to do it
for a fair price.

31:51.866 --> 31:54.521
In exchange, you'll get
first bidding rights

31:54.564 --> 31:56.001
on all future projects.

31:56.044 --> 31:59.482
PPA is just one small piece
of the Flores empire.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.311
I'm surprised to see
this side of you, Cristal.

32:02.355 --> 32:04.444
I thought of you more
as a backseat driver.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.054
Oh, I'm in
the front seat, Sonya.

32:06.098 --> 32:08.274
I'm the one who brought
the power and money

32:08.317 --> 32:09.971
to the merger with PPA.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.932
So, are you ready
to make a deal with me?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.417
Hey...

32:21.461 --> 32:24.377
I heard there was a power
failure at the Alexam lab.

32:24.420 --> 32:27.597
I Sure hope it didn't ruin
anything that needed, say...

32:27.641 --> 32:28.685
refrigeration.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.688
Nice try.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.039
But I moved my ingredients
to another refrigeration source

32:34.082 --> 32:35.823
to keep them
from being destroyed.

32:35.866 --> 32:37.564
So... Sorry, Sis. You failed.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.131
Did I?

32:39.174 --> 32:41.394
'Cause I just can't help
but wonder where you moved

32:41.437 --> 32:43.004
your secret ingredient to.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.615
No doubt somewhere with
a medical grade refrigerator.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.704
Huh! Like this one.

32:48.575 --> 32:49.576
Um...

32:49.619 --> 32:51.230
You-you shouldn't...

32:51.273 --> 32:53.014
Yeah, caref
You can come in now.

32:56.235 --> 32:58.150
This must be
the Bokocho extract

32:58.193 --> 33:00.587
I read so
much about in your emails.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.067
Well, yeah.
You can't prove that.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.329
There's, uh...
There's no label.

33:03.372 --> 33:04.895
Oh, we'll have it tested.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.549
Seeing it is illegal to
possess, I must warn you

33:06.593 --> 33:08.073
that this could get us
into serious trouble

33:08.116 --> 33:09.335
with the FDA.

33:09.378 --> 33:10.858
And once the board
learns about

33:10.901 --> 33:12.860
your breach of ethics
and the law,

33:12.903 --> 33:15.036
it's likely gonna cost you
your chief of staff position.

33:18.605 --> 33:21.303
You didn't want to destroy
my supply, did you?

33:21.347 --> 33:23.175
No, no, no.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.655
I just needed you
to bring it here.

33:25.699 --> 33:28.528
After all, I'm not a monster.

33:32.793 --> 33:33.881
<i>Listen to me.</i>

33:33.924 --> 33:35.622
We are going to be okay.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.189
- You don't know that.
- Talk to me.

33:37.232 --> 33:40.496
Maybe tell me why you
were distracted and rude

33:40.540 --> 33:41.497
at breakfast yesterday.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.933
You want to know?
Well...

33:42.977 --> 33:44.283
I think I might be pregnant.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.068
Fallon, that's fantastic news!

33:47.112 --> 33:48.504
All right.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.289
Calm down, Grandma.
It's been like five minutes.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.508
I wanted to wait
till I went to the doctor

33:52.552 --> 33:53.727
to confirm before I told Liam,

33:53.770 --> 33:55.337
but clearly,
that did not happen.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.383
So, Liam doesn't
know, but I do?

33:57.426 --> 33:58.993
Okay, I promise
I won't say a word.

33:59.037 --> 33:59.994
No, it's fine.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.300
It's fine.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.041
I was gonna tell him
once I knew for sure,

34:03.084 --> 34:04.216
but I'm glad that you know.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.869
You are?
Yeah.

34:05.913 --> 34:09.090
I mean, you're gonna be
a big part of this baby's
life.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.397
And I know that you think
everybody hates you

34:11.440 --> 34:13.268
and has abandoned you,
but I'm still here.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.488
And Amanda will cool off.
And I have forgiven you

34:15.531 --> 34:17.446
many, many times... Okay, what's your point?

34:17.490 --> 34:20.319
My point is, maybe you should
learn to forgive yourself.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.624
Right? I mean,
you deserve happiness

34:21.668 --> 34:23.061
as much as the next woman.

34:23.104 --> 34:25.367
So if you're gonna
chase after Dex

34:25.411 --> 34:27.021
and you're gonna
propose to him,

34:27.065 --> 34:29.067
then you should be sure
that it's for the right reasons.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.678
I'm sure about Dex.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.375
Hello? Mrs. Colby,

34:33.419 --> 34:35.073
are you home? What happened?

34:35.116 --> 34:36.683
Yes, we're here.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.511
In the panic room.
Access the generator.

34:38.554 --> 34:41.427
The power line's been cut. Okay.

34:41.470 --> 34:44.430
Do you think she's gonna
charge more for cleaning up
ransacking?

34:44.473 --> 34:45.909
The power's on.

34:48.869 --> 34:52.525
You see? When you are patient,
the universe provides.

34:52.568 --> 34:54.701
Or at least
the housekeeper does.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.746
Do you want me to go
- with you to the doctor?
- No.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.271
No, it's just a blood test.
I'll be fine.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.099
Good luck.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.622
And what about you?

35:02.665 --> 35:05.146
Are you gonna go hop on a
plane and chase after Dex,

35:05.190 --> 35:08.236
or are you gonna trust the
universe that you don't have
to?

35:14.199 --> 35:16.331
- You got a minute?
- Are you gonna grab

35:16.375 --> 35:17.985
this menu out of my hand
and rip it in half?

35:18.028 --> 35:19.856
I am not. Looks like
a heavy card stock.

35:22.903 --> 35:25.862
Listen, man, I was way
out of line last night.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.212
Ah, forget about it.

35:27.255 --> 35:28.387
Apparently, that's
what happens on movie sets.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.040
You creative types
get all defensive.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.347
I realized
I rewrote that scene

35:32.391 --> 35:33.783
to make myself...

35:34.741 --> 35:37.570
...Lionel look better,

35:37.613 --> 35:39.833
because I was feeling guilty.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.182
- Guilty about what?
- I did some...

35:41.226 --> 35:42.618
questionable things
in the past

35:42.662 --> 35:43.880
to steal Fallon from you,

35:43.924 --> 35:45.621
and I was just,
I don't know,

35:45.665 --> 35:47.797
I guess I was just trying to
rewrite history or something.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.495
Is that what this is about?

35:49.538 --> 35:53.194
Okay, yeah, sure, you weren't
my favorite person back then.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.630
But do you think

35:54.674 --> 35:56.241
Fallon did anything
that she didn't want to do?

35:56.284 --> 35:58.852
Say, if she heard you say
you stole her from me...

36:01.333 --> 36:03.204
Yeah.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.814
Yeah, you do make
a good point.

36:04.858 --> 36:07.643
Hey, look. No offense
to your romantic skills,

36:07.687 --> 36:09.776
but that woman ended up
with exactly

36:09.819 --> 36:11.386
who she was meant to be with.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.301
Just like we all will.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.129
I appreciate you saying that.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.957
And, hey, I got to say,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.568
working together,
it's been a lot of fun.

36:19.612 --> 36:21.048
It has.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.485
Especially if I don't
have to tell Nina

36:23.529 --> 36:25.313
that the writer
is demanding a reshoot.

36:25.357 --> 36:28.360
No reshoot. We're wrapped.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.276
Congrats, man.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.541
<i>Salud.</i> <i>Salud.</i>

36:36.542 --> 36:38.848
Good news. I got Sonya

36:38.892 --> 36:40.850
to agree to get our
radar tower up to code

36:40.894 --> 36:42.287
at 100 percent
over cost,

36:42.330 --> 36:43.592
not 400.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.115
What?
You talked to Sonya?

36:45.159 --> 36:47.683
- I did.
- Without telling me?

36:47.727 --> 36:49.468
That seems... strange.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.253
But hey, that's a...
that's a good number,

36:52.297 --> 36:54.995
so I'll sign off on it.

36:55.038 --> 36:57.302
That's sweet, but I don't
need you to sign off.

36:57.345 --> 37:00.609
I'm the largest stakeholder
in the company, remember?

37:00.653 --> 37:01.697
The deal is done.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.222
You should be thrilled, Blake.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.661
Our airport will now
open on schedule.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.273
Oh, and, um...

37:12.317 --> 37:15.320
next time someone challenges
us to Rock Paper Scissors,

37:15.363 --> 37:16.538
I'll play.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.672
Well, let's just hope
there is no next time.

37:19.715 --> 37:20.890
To PPA.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.031
Sorry, not interested.

37:32.772 --> 37:36.210
Understood. I-I'll just
apologize to the door.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.604
Very loudly.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.258
Fine. Come in.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.523
Look, I never should have
involved you

37:44.566 --> 37:47.308
in any Carrington
sibling drama, okay?

37:47.352 --> 37:49.528
For some reason, Adam,
he just gets into my head

37:49.571 --> 37:51.312
and I end up
doing crazy things.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.401
I can certainly
- relate to that.
- And you were right.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.837
I never should have shared
my feelings with you

37:54.881 --> 37:57.057
five seconds before
you left for Milan, okay?

37:57.100 --> 37:58.493
Especially because
you're with Charlie.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.713
Can we just pretend that
that never happened?

38:00.756 --> 38:02.758
Well, we could.

38:02.802 --> 38:04.369
Except Charlie and I
are over now.

38:04.412 --> 38:07.459
Oh... I'm sorry.

38:08.677 --> 38:13.378
We decided that a client/rep
relationship was too exhausting

38:13.421 --> 38:15.554
with all the extra
baggage, so...

38:15.597 --> 38:17.120
strictly professional now.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.948
Plus...

38:18.992 --> 38:20.341
the whole time I
was in Milan...

38:22.343 --> 38:25.041
...I couldn't stop thinking
about that kiss with you.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.524
So, um, you're saying that

38:29.568 --> 38:31.570
you don't think kissing me
was a huge mistake?

38:31.613 --> 38:32.571
I'm just curious.

38:32.614 --> 38:33.746
I don't know.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.575
I guess there's
only one way to find out.

38:43.582 --> 38:44.757
Maybe we should just do it,

38:44.800 --> 38:46.062
like, one more time,
just to be sure.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.067
Yes, this is Mrs. Colby.

38:51.111 --> 38:53.505
Can you tell my driver
I no longer need him?

38:54.593 --> 38:56.899
I've decided not to go
to the airport.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.249
I don't understand.
Are you sure?

39:05.908 --> 39:06.866
Hey.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.171
What are you doing here?

39:08.215 --> 39:09.259
Shouldn't you be getting
on a plane?

39:09.303 --> 39:10.522
I was on my way

39:10.565 --> 39:13.002
to the airport,
but realized that I needed

39:13.046 --> 39:14.787
to say something to you
before I left.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.136
That's so funny.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.833
I was this close
to racing to the airport

39:17.877 --> 39:19.357
to catch you
before you took off.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.359
Really? Like a rom-com?

39:21.402 --> 39:23.361
Were you gonna
get down on one knee

39:23.404 --> 39:25.101
and ask me to marry you
at gate 31B?

39:25.145 --> 39:27.452
Oh, I probably wouldn't have
gotten down on one knee.

39:27.495 --> 39:30.063
Wait. You weren't really
going to propose, were you?

39:30.106 --> 39:31.543
I was.

39:31.586 --> 39:34.067
I know it's insane,

39:34.110 --> 39:37.723
but it was out of fear
I was going to lose you.

39:37.766 --> 39:41.117
Lose me? I was only going
- to be gone for a few weeks.
- I know.

39:42.554 --> 39:43.990
And, um...

39:44.033 --> 39:46.514
I realized that
I don't need to rush us.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.386
If the timing is right,
we'll know.

39:48.429 --> 39:50.344
I get it.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.695
- It... You think I'm crazy.
- No.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.612
I just think
the coincidence is crazy.

39:58.613 --> 40:01.529
Stop it.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.444
I can't...

40:03.488 --> 40:05.403
...because what I came
back to say is...

40:05.446 --> 40:07.535
will you marry me?

40:09.494 --> 40:11.104
I think the time is right.

40:13.323 --> 40:15.238
Right now.

40:15.282 --> 40:17.763
You really want to spend
the rest of your life with me?

40:17.806 --> 40:19.504
I can't imagine living
another day without you.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.593
So what do you say?

40:22.768 --> 40:24.857
Because my knee is
starting to lock up.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.729
Of course I will marry you.

40:27.773 --> 40:30.819
A thousand times yes.

40:30.863 --> 40:32.604
I only need one.

40:42.265 --> 40:44.616
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.661
The movie is wrapped

40:46.705 --> 40:49.359
and I am ready to celebrate
this milestone

40:49.403 --> 40:51.187
with the love of my life.

40:52.232 --> 40:53.929
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

40:53.973 --> 40:56.497
- Where have you been all day?
- Well...

40:56.541 --> 40:58.586
it's kind of long story.

40:58.630 --> 41:02.242
And then, I went
to the doctor, and...

41:02.285 --> 41:04.374
then I was just walking.

41:05.375 --> 41:06.681
Is everything okay?

41:08.770 --> 41:11.077
Well, I have
to tell you something.

41:12.165 --> 41:14.515
I was just at the OBGYN

41:14.559 --> 41:15.603
and...

41:15.647 --> 41:17.039
I'm not pregnant.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.563
I really thought that I was,

41:18.606 --> 41:20.826
and the test said
that I was, but...

41:20.869 --> 41:23.524
...my doctor told me
it was just a false positive.

41:23.568 --> 41:24.612
Fallon...

41:24.656 --> 41:26.919
Hey, I'm sorry.

41:26.962 --> 41:30.052
It's okay. We'll just...
We'll keep trying

41:30.096 --> 41:33.055
- And it will happen.
- Yeah, well...

41:33.099 --> 41:35.014
That's the thing. No.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.972
It won't happen.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.020
My doctor...

41:41.063 --> 41:45.024
...he said that because
of the scar tissue

41:45.067 --> 41:46.547
from where I got shot...

41:48.288 --> 41:49.942
I won't be able
to carry a baby.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.336
Ever.
