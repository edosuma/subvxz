00:12.930 --> 00:14.180
[MALACHY] SAM PARSONS.

00:14.220 --> 00:15.220
NUMBER NINE. BRUNETTE.

00:28.860 --> 00:30.150

WANT TO HURRY IT UP.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.490
HANG ON A SECOND.

00:31.530 --> 00:32.700

[WALTER] &lt;INTO PHONE&gt; PINK IS
THE BAD ONE?

00:41.580 --> 00:43.500
[JAKE] &lt;OVER PHONE&gt; PINK IS
PREGNANT WALTER. ALL RIGHT?

00:43.540 --> 00:45.210
CAN YOU IMAGINE ME
BEING A FATHER?

00:45.250 --> 00:47.250
[WALTER] COULD BE
SOMEONE ELSE'S.

00:47.290 --> 00:51.590
SOME DRIFTER
SHE LURED BACK AND DE-SEEDED
BEFORE FLAYING HIM ALIVE.

00:51.630 --> 00:54.630
[JAKE] &lt;OVER PHONE&gt;
IT WASN'T SOME ELSE'S.
THERE IS NO OTHER GUY, WALTER.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.760
WAIT A MINUTE, DO YOU
THINK THERE'S ANOTHER GUY?

00:56.800 --> 00:58.140
[WALTER] I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE THE P.I MAN.

00:58.180 --> 00:59.850

[JAKE] WHAT'D WANT ME TO DO?

00:59.890 --> 01:02.810

BE EX-WIFE. AND I'M AN OFFICER

01:05.140 --> 01:08.190

A THING LIKE THAT.

01:08.230 --> 01:11.320

"DO THE DUE DILIGENCE."

01:11.360 --> 01:13.240
[JAKE] WHERE ARE YOU ANYWAY?
[WALTER] &lt;OVER PHONE&gt; CLIENT.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.160

01:15.200 --> 01:16.660

FOR THE DOYLES.

01:16.700 --> 01:17.990
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

01:18.030 --> 01:21.740

01:35.970 --> 01:37.260
DAD?

01:37.300 --> 01:38.800

FOR THAT NOW ANYWAY.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.420

02:13.460 --> 02:16.340

02:18.340 --> 02:20.350
[JAKE] TECHNICALLY,
IT'S STILL THE BANKS.

02:28.310 --> 02:31.310

AT LEAST 5 MONTHS.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.320
FINE, FINE. IT'S YOUR RIG.

02:43.410 --> 02:46.250
THIS ISN'T HOW IT PLAYED OUT
IN MY DREAMS AT ALL.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.400
[JAKE] HE'S NOT HERE!

03:12.440 --> 03:14.270
WALTER SAID FOR US TO MEET

03:14.320 --> 03:15.230
[MALACHY] &lt;INTO PHONE&gt; HOLD ON.

03:15.270 --> 03:16.990
WHO IS THIS WE'RE MEETING?

03:17.030 --> 03:21.360
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW,
SOME BIG CASH CLIENT HE SAID.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.280
[MALACHY] SORRY.
[ROSE] TINNY'S GONE MALACHY.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.540
HER DRAWERS ARE EMPTY.
SHE TOOK HER CLOTHES, HER IPOD.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.580
SHE ALSO LEFT A NOTE.

03:28.620 --> 03:30.620
"YOUR ACCOMMODATIONS ARE NO
LONGER-REQUIRED"

03:30.670 --> 03:31.790
THAT'S IT.

03:31.830 --> 03:33.000

03:33.040 --> 03:34.460
[ROSE] &lt;OVER PHONE&gt; SHE'S
PROBABLY WITH THE "DWAYNE"

03:34.500 --> 03:37.260
FELLA SHE'S BEEN SEEING.
[MALACHY] I'LL CUT HIM IN HALF.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.470
[ROSE] &lt;OVER PHONE&gt; YEAH,
THAT'LL SOLVE THE PROBLEM
FOR SURE.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.390
WE HAVE TO BE CALM, MAL.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.300
[MALACHY] SHE'S 16!

03:44.350 --> 03:47.470

[MALACHY] I'LL GO OVER THERE

03:55.520 --> 03:58.320
[ROSE] I'VE NO INTEREST IN
PLAYING MOMMY. I REALLY DON'T.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.240

04:02.280 --> 04:04.740

HOUSE DOWN.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.290
[JAKE] WHAT WAS THAT?
[MALACHY] NOTHING.

04:14.330 --> 04:16.340
TAXES, NOTHING.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.420
[JAKE] WHY'RE YOU SO CROOKED
TODAY?

04:19.460 --> 04:22.470
[MALACHY] I'M NOT CROOKED.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.270
[JAKE] NICE RIDE OLD MAN.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.650
DOES IT COME WITH A DRIVER

TIME INSIDE TO LEARN THAT NAME.

04:58.420 --> 04:59.550

04:59.590 --> 05:01.960
YOU'RE ALL PALE ALL OF A
SUDDEN.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.010
[MALACHY] I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

05:06.510 --> 05:08.680
[CARL] I NEVER KILLED HER IN
CASE YOU WERE WONDERING.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.720
IN CASE YOU CARES, YOU KNOW?

05:13.560 --> 05:15.690
[CARL] THERE'S A HUNDRED GRAND

06:01.570 --> 06:04.150
HE GOT TO DO IT TOO
OR WE GOT NO DEAL!

06:04.190 --> 06:05.740
[JAKE] WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING
AT THERE, PALLY?
[WALTER] JAKE.

06:05.780 --> 06:07.740
[CARL] I DID 12 YEARS FOR
KILLING THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.450
YOUR OLD MAN, ALL THE COPS,
THEY PINNED ME TO THE CROSS.

06:10.490 --> 06:11.530
I WANTS HIM TO PROVE.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.410
LOOK AT ME.

06:13.450 --> 06:15.710
I WANTS HIM TO PROVE THAT
I GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH

06:15.750 --> 06:17.500
MELISSA DYING.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.830
I WANTS JUSTICE.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.000
[WALTER] THE CROWN ADMITTED
THEY SCREWED UP ON THIS ONE

06:21.040 --> 06:23.380
JAKE. THEY WENT AFTER CARL
LIKE A POODLE ON A PORK CHOP.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.260
[CARL] SHUT UP!

06:25.300 --> 06:27.510
SAID THEY HAD THE MURDER
WEAPON. THEY GOT NOTHING.

06:27.550 --> 06:29.970
[WALTER] SHOULD NEVER HAVE
GONE TO TRIAL.
[CALL GIRL#1] CARL?

06:30.010 --> 06:35.100
WE BILL BY THE HOUR.

06:35.140 --> 06:38.190
[CARL] GO ON IN GIRLS,
START WITHOUT ME.

06:38.230 --> 06:42.570
LOOKING GOOD, CAN WE MAKE OUT?

06:42.610 --> 06:44.070
SORRY.

06:44.110 --> 06:45.900
[JAKE] SO YOU WERE SAYING
SOMETHING ABOUT THE NIGHT THE

06:45.940 --> 06:47.320
"LOVE OF YOUR LIFE" WAS KILLED?

06:47.360 --> 06:49.360
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ME
THROUGH THAT.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.700
[CARL] I COME HOME DRUNK RIGHT?

06:55.750 --> 07:00.420
LOST MY KEYS AND
PASSED OUT IN THE BACKYARD.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.210
I DIDN'T WANT MELISSA
TO SEE ME DRUNK,

07:02.250 --> 07:04.840
SO I LAY DOWN ON THE
GROUND, FELL ASLEEP.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.130
YOU GOT NO IDEA SIR
HOW I WISHES I WOULDA POUNDED

07:08.170 --> 07:10.470
ON THAT DOOR...

07:10.510 --> 07:12.430
DRUNK OR NO.

07:12.470 --> 07:16.020
[WALTER] THE COPS CAME BY THE
NEXT DAY, HE WAS STILL ASLEEP.
[CARL] SHUT UP!

07:16.060 --> 07:18.640
AND EVER SINCE THEN,
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING SO
GOOD, SO...

07:18.680 --> 07:21.600
[JAKE] OH YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.400
[CARL] $4 MILLION IS A LOT OF
CASH. BUT IT WON'T BRING BACK MY

07:24.440 --> 07:26.820
WIFE, IS IT?

07:26.860 --> 07:29.490
[JAKE] I SUPPOSE NOT.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.740
OKAY LOOK...

07:31.780 --> 07:35.080
THIS INVESTIGATION MAY TAKE A
WHILE. YOU KNOW WITNESSES MOVE

07:35.120 --> 07:36.580
AWAY, DIE.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.830
[CARL] I'LL MAKE IT REAL EASY
FOR YOU BUDDY. I KNOWS WHO

07:38.870 --> 07:41.120
KILLED HER ALREADY. IT WAS MY
BROTHER, BOBBY. HE WAS

07:41.170 --> 07:43.080
SLEEPING WITH MELISSA AND
I KNOWS HE KILLED HER. OKAY SO

07:43.130 --> 07:45.550
ALL YOUR FATHERS GOTTA DO IS
PROVE IT!

07:45.590 --> 07:46.550
[JAKE] OKAY.

07:48.090 --> 07:50.470
WELL, I'LL TALK TO SKIPPER.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.260
BUT IF HE DOES TAKE THE CASE,
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT HE WILL,

07:54.300 --> 07:57.060
AND HE PROVES THAT YOU DID IN
FACT KILLED YOUR WIFE,

07:57.100 --> 08:00.100
THAT'S A CHEQUE YOU'LL BE
WRITING FROM JAIL, MY FRIEND.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.270
[CARL] BUDDY,
I GOT NOTHING LEFT TO HIDE

08:05.310 --> 08:07.280
AND NOTHIN' LEFT TO LOOSE.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.690
SHE WAS ALL OF IT.

08:13.610 --> 08:17.870
YOU GET YOUR MONEY NO MATTER
WHO YOU FINDS THAT KILLED HER.

08:17.910 --> 08:20.710
[JAKE] YOU SHOULD
YOU KNOW GET YOURSELF
A CHESTERFIELD, SOMETHING.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.000
IT'LL SOFTEN THE PLACE UP.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.550
[MALACHY] SURE. I WENT EVERY
DAY OF THAT TRIAL. HE SAT

08:27.590 --> 08:30.300
THERE. NOT A TEAR, NOT AN
OUNCE OF REMORSE. THEN THAT

08:30.340 --> 08:33.470
MORON PROSECUTOR RUSHED THAT
DODGY KNIFE INTO EVIDENCE.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.600
[JAKE] A HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY, DAD.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.140
[MALACHY] WHY ARE YOU SO HARD
UP FOR CASH?

08:37.180 --> 08:39.770
[JAKE] I'M NOT. IT'S JUST--
[ROSE] JAKE COULD GET HIS OWN

08:39.810 --> 08:41.390
PLACE. FREE UP ONE ROOM
IN THE DOYLE FAMILY FLOP

08:41.430 --> 08:43.770
HOUSE. JUST IMAGINE WHAT WE
COULD DO WITH ALL THAT EXTRA

08:43.810 --> 08:46.690
SPACE.
[MALACHY] LISTEN IT'S A MIRACLE

08:46.730 --> 08:49.400
CARL MAHER STAYED OUT OF JAIL
AS LONG AS HE DID.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.110
THIS IS NOT SOME ALTAR BOY.

08:51.150 --> 08:53.400
HE'S A SLEEVEEN, ALWAYS WAS.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.620
[JAKE] WE'RE DOING THIS.
[MALACHY] IS THAT RIGHT?

08:55.660 --> 08:57.580
YOU'RE CALLING ALL THE SHOTS
NOW ARE YOU?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.040

09:01.910 --> 09:04.540

09:27.310 --> 09:29.610

09:34.360 --> 09:39.950
I-- I WAS HOPING THAT WE COULD
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.370
BUT YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT
FEELING GOOD OR WHATEVER,

09:42.410 --> 09:43.790
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.210
[NIKKI] NO, NO, NO.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.790
TEA IS UH-- TEA IS NICE.

NEVER YOUR MIND.

10:00.010 --> 10:01.390
[JAKE] WHAT CASE?

10:01.430 --> 10:02.770
[MALACHY] LOOK, IF YOU'RE SUCH
A FIEND FOR THE CASH,

10:02.810 --> 10:04.930

10:04.980 --> 10:06.190
[JAKE] THANK YOU.

10:06.230 --> 10:10.310
OUR CLIENT IS THE WRONGFULLY
CONVICTED CARL MAHER.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.820
[MALACHY] ALLEGEDLY WRONGFULLY
CONVICTED.

10:11.860 --> 10:12.820
[JAKE] WHATEVER.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.990
HIS WIFE, MELISSA,
WAS STABBED FOUR TIMES

10:15.030 --> 10:16.200
IN THEIR OWN HOME.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.360
NOW THE POLICE--
[MALACHY] THE POLICE RECOVERED

10:17.410 --> 10:18.700
A KNIFE AT THE SCENE,

10:18.740 --> 10:20.200
WHICH AS IT TURNED OUT WAS
NOT THE MURDER WEAPON.

10:20.240 --> 10:20.830
ALLEGEDLY.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.160
[ROSE] OKAY, OKAY.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.450
SO FAR ON THE MAHER FAMILY
WE'VE GOT BROTHER CARL,

10:24.500 --> 10:28.080
BROTHER BOBBY AND A YOUNGER
SISTER, CRYSTAL.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.210
CRYSTAL STILL LOOKS AFTER THE
MOTHER'S WHO'S AN INVALID.

10:30.250 --> 10:33.840
[DES] SHE'S HOT.
[JAKE] THAT'S DISGUSTING.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.380
[DES] I MEAN THE GIRL,
NOT THE OLD MISSUS.

10:35.420 --> 10:36.840
I'M NOT INTO "GILFS".

10:36.880 --> 10:39.300
[MALACHY] WHAT?
[DES] GILFS.

10:39.340 --> 10:41.890
A GILF. IT'S A--
[JAKE] NOTHING!

10:41.930 --> 10:42.810
GILF IS A NOTHING.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.810
[DES] IT'S A NOTHING.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.980
[JAKE] CARL GAVE ME A LEAD.
[MALACHY] AH, YES.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.440
"THE BROTHER DID IT."

10:49.480 --> 10:51.900
[ROSE] OKAY, IF WE'RE STILL
LOOKING INTO THE BROTHER.

10:51.940 --> 10:55.190
BECAUSE HE'S WORKS AT A SCRAP
YARD OVER IN SHAE HIGHTS.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.700
[JAKE] YES WE ARE LOOKING INTO
THE BROTHER. CARL THINKS THAT

10:57.740 --> 11:00.780
BOBBY WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH MELISSA. IT'S A LEAD,

11:00.820 --> 11:01.820
WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW IT.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.490
LET'S GO.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.500
[MALACHY] ANY NEWS ON TINNY?

11:08.540 --> 11:10.580

11:11.960 --> 11:14.460
[MALACHY] RIGHT, RIGHT.

11:14.500 --> 11:18.920
I'M FINE, THANKS.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.010
[DES] HOW DO YOU END UP WITH
THE WRONG KNIFE?

11:21.050 --> 11:22.300
[ROSE] EASY.

11:22.340 --> 11:25.890
YOU FIND A KNIFE AT THE CRIME
SCENE.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.480
THE TESTS SHOW THAT THERE IS
ALL THESE CUTS AND NICKS ALONG

11:28.520 --> 11:29.850
THE BLADE.

11:29.890 --> 11:34.900
PROSECUTOR "FORGETS"
TO MENTION THAT.

11:34.940 --> 11:36.570
AND HERE WE ARE.

11:38.940 --> 11:39.990
YOU GOING TO SNOOP ON
MY COMPUTER

11:40.030 --> 11:42.410
OR SAY THE WORD "GILF" IN MY
HOUSE EVER AGAIN?

11:42.450 --> 11:45.030
[DES] NO NEVER.
[ROSE] COOL.

11:45.080 --> 11:45.950
GOOD ANSWER.

11:45.990 --> 11:47.750

[MALACHY] &lt;FROM INTERCOM&gt; JAKE
WHATEVER YOU DO,

12:05.050 --> 12:06.600

12:06.640 --> 12:07.770
[JAKE] &lt;WHISPERS&gt; THANKS FOR THE
CONFIDENCE.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.100
&lt;LOUDER&gt; OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU
LATER HONEY. BUH-BYE.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.140
[JAKE] HEY, WHAT YOU GOT?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.810
[BOBBY] THIS IS IT.

12:13.850 --> 12:14.610
NICE CAR!

12:14.650 --> 12:15.900
[JAKE] OH YEAH, THANKS.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.530

12:18.570 --> 12:21.280
[JAKE] SHE'S A 68 ACTUALLY.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.320
MUFFLER'S GOING.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.860

FOR IT?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.910
[BOBBY] MUFFLER SOUNDS FINE.
[JAKE] YEAH, I KNOW.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.120
I CAN SORT OF FEEL WHEN
SHE'S STARTING TO GO.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.200
I DON'T WANNA GET CAUGHT.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.250
[BOBBY] I MIGHT'VE SOMETHING
IN THERE.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.750
[JAKE] &lt;INTO INTERCOM&gt;
I'M GONNA HAVE A LOOK AROUND.

12:44.010 --> 12:46.220

13:00.030 --> 13:03.530
[MALACHY] YOU'RE ALWAYS
GOOD WITH THE ANIMALS.

13:03.570 --> 13:05.570
&lt;DOG BARKING&gt;

13:12.830 --> 13:14.920

13:25.050 --> 13:26.430
[JAKE] AH!

13:28.050 --> 13:29.810
[MALACHY] AH, MELISSA.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.400
&lt;♪♪&gt;

13:39.440 --> 13:41.440
&lt;DOG BARKING&gt;

13:52.080 --> 13:54.040
[MALACHY] BOB HAD
A REASON TO BE JUMPY.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.830
[JAKE] THANKS FOR THE
HELP SKIPPER!

13:56.870 --> 14:00.040
[MALACHY] CARL'S GOT QUITE
A WAY WITH WORDS.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.210
[JAKE] WELL NOW.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.050
[MALACHY] I'M GONNA SHOVE
CARL'S CREATIVE FAXING

14:03.090 --> 14:05.090
RIGHT UP HIS ARSE. I KNOW
HE SENT THESE, JAKE.

14:05.130 --> 14:05.930
[JAKE] LOOK, OUR FIRST

14:05.970 --> 14:07.720
PRIORITY IS TO FIND BOB,
ALRIGHT?

14:07.760 --> 14:10.850
SECOND, IS TO PROVE THERE WAS
AN AFFAIR, CAUSE THAT'S MOTIVE.

14:10.890 --> 14:12.930
NOW YOU STICK ON THE SISTER,
AND I'LL FIND BOBBY.

14:12.970 --> 14:15.020
[MALACHY] HOW?
[JAKE] I GOT MY WAYS.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.480
[MALACHY] YEAH, "YOUR WAYS".

14:16.520 --> 14:20.150
ANY BLONDE WITH A BADGE.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.110
&lt;DOG BARKING&gt;

14:22.150 --> 14:23.940
[MALACHY] GET THAT
POOR THING OUT.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.990
I DIDN'T RAISE YOU TO BE CRUEL.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.660
[JAKE] YOU WATCH YOURSELF.

14:29.570 --> 14:32.450
&lt;DOG BARKING&gt;
[JAKE] HELLO, S.P.C.A?

14:32.490 --> 14:35.500
&lt;♪♪&gt;

14:37.160 --> 14:39.210
[LESLIE] MAN, ARE YOU MESSING
WITH THE WRONG CASE, DOYLE.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.670
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT CARL MAHER
TO JUST GO AWAY.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.210
[JAKE] YEAH I KNOW.

14:43.250 --> 14:47.300
LOOK, I NEED YOU TO RUN A PLATE
FOR ME.

14:47.340 --> 14:48.510
[LESLIE] BOBBY MAHER?

14:48.550 --> 14:49.180
JAKE ARE YOU SERIOUS?

14:49.220 --> 14:50.800
HE'S A DEAD END.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.390
CARL WAS CONVINCED HE WAS
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MELISSA,

14:52.430 --> 14:54.890
BUT THERE WAS NEVER
A SHRED OF PROOF.

14:54.930 --> 14:57.060
[JAKE] YOU KNOW FOR A CASE
THAT'S ALMOST AS OLD AS YOU ARE,

14:57.100 --> 15:00.020
YOU SEEM TO KNOW
A WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT.

15:00.060 --> 15:03.270
DO YOU THINK MAYBE I COULD GET
A LOOK AT THE CASE FILE?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.030
[LESLIE] SURE, DOYLE.

15:05.070 --> 15:09.110
HOW ABOUT A PONY RIDE
WHILE I'M AT IT?

15:09.150 --> 15:10.030
I'LL RUN THE PLATE.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.990
BUT DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK.

15:12.030 --> 15:15.540
[JAKE] HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU
THAT YOU GET BETTER LOOKING

15:15.580 --> 15:23.090
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU?
[LESLIE] YOU REALLY THINK

15:23.130 --> 15:25.710
THAT'S GOING TO GET YOU A LOOK
AT MY FILE?

15:25.750 --> 15:29.050
[JAKE] JUST A PEEK.
[LESLIE] COPS WANT TO FORGET

15:29.090 --> 15:31.340
THIS CASE.
[JAKE] I KNOW, MY OLD MAN'S

15:31.390 --> 15:34.140
BEEN HANGING ONTO THIS ONE FOR
YEARS.

15:34.180 --> 15:35.600
[LESLIE] JAKE?

15:35.640 --> 15:37.100
YOUR FATHER NEVER WORKED
THE MAHER CASE.

15:37.140 --> 15:39.140
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.990
&lt;♪♪&gt;

15:50.200 --> 15:53.660
[CRYSTAL] MELISSA TOOK THIS
FAMILY AND SHAPED US UP.

15:53.700 --> 15:57.620
EVERYTHING GOT DIFFERENT AFTER
SHE PAST.

15:57.660 --> 16:00.460
NOT JUST CARL AND JAIL BUT...

16:00.500 --> 16:03.040
MOM FADED AND...

16:03.080 --> 16:05.130

16:05.170 --> 16:06.960
IF YOU'RE WORKING FOR CARL,
HE'S PROBABLY GOT YOU ONTO

16:07.000 --> 16:08.090
"THE BIG AFFAIR."
[MALACHY] YOU DON'T THINK

16:08.130 --> 16:09.130
THERE WAS TRUTH TO IT?

16:09.170 --> 16:11.050
BOB AND CARL'S WIFE?

16:11.090 --> 16:14.680
[CRYSTAL] NO.
[MOTHER MAHER] DO BOTH SIDES!

16:14.720 --> 16:17.100

YOU'RE TOLD!

16:26.520 --> 16:27.730

16:29.860 --> 16:32.820

SHE'S DISORIENTED.

16:32.860 --> 16:34.200
[MALACHY] YEAH.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.240
IT'S A CRUEL THING
GETTING OLDER.

16:38.240 --> 16:42.120
&lt;YOGA MUSIC&gt;
[ROSE] HERE TO GET SOME

16:42.160 --> 16:45.630
GROCERIES I SUPPOSE?
[TINNY] NO. I JUST WANTED TO

16:45.670 --> 16:48.050
DROP BY.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.590
WHERE IS UNCLE JAKE?

16:49.630 --> 16:51.130
[ROSE] LEAVING YOUR GRANDFATHER
A NOTE TO LET US KNOW YOU'D

16:51.170 --> 16:53.220
MOVED OUT WAS LOW CLASS TINNY.

16:53.260 --> 16:54.380

16:54.430 --> 16:55.930
[TINNY] I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

16:55.970 --> 16:57.720
[ROSE] I WOULD LOCK YOU IN THIS
HOUSE RIGHT NOW, IF I DIDN'T

16:57.760 --> 17:00.640
THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE
YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE IN LOVE

17:00.680 --> 17:03.270
WITH THIS GUY. GOD FORBID AND
DRIVE YOU FURTHER AWAY

17:03.310 --> 17:05.400
FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.110
I WAS YOU ONCE, BUT I WASN'T
LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A MAN LIKE

17:09.150 --> 17:13.530
MALACHY IN MY LIFE.

17:13.570 --> 17:15.030
OR EVEN JAKE FOR THAT MATER.

17:15.070 --> 17:16.200
[TINNY] I DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN TO YOU.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.580
[ROSE] NO YOU DON'T.
YOU DO NOT.

17:19.620 --> 17:21.750
HERE IS THE DEAL.

17:21.790 --> 17:26.040
I COULDN'T CARE LESS THAT YOU
MOVED AWAY. I COULDN'T CARE

17:26.080 --> 17:30.300
LESS IF YOU RAN OFF AND MARRIED
THIS GUY. NONE OF THAT MATTERS

17:30.340 --> 17:35.300
TO ME. BUT IT MATTERS TO THE
MAN THAT I LOVE. SO IF DWAYNE

17:35.340 --> 17:37.510
HAS HIS WITS ABOUT HIM, DWAYNE
WILL GET HIS ASS OVER HERE

17:37.550 --> 17:38.930

[JAKE] &lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;
I SHOULD, YOU KNOW...

29:48.450 --> 29:49.120

29:49.160 --> 29:50.370
I SHOULD GO.

29:50.410 --> 29:51.660
PROBABLY LET YOU GUYS SORT OF
WORK THIS OUT.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.580

30:13.810 --> 30:15.440
[DWAYNE] UM...

30:15.480 --> 30:18.940
IT'S ACTUALLY-- IT'S "DWAYNE".

30:18.980 --> 30:21.980
[MALACHY] SORRY... DWAYNE.

30:25.190 --> 30:28.200
HOW DO YOU LIKE SLEEPING WITH
MY GRAND DAUGHTER?

30:34.450 --> 30:36.040
[JAKE] CRYSTAL MAHER'S
A HEAD CASE.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.790
[MALACHY] WHY?

30:37.830 --> 30:40.670
[JAKE] SHE'S THE ONE
PLANTED THE SEED WITH
CARL ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

30:40.710 --> 30:43.000
WHO'S HE?
[TINNY] UNCLE JAKE.

30:43.050 --> 30:44.050
YOU KNOW DWAYNE.

30:44.090 --> 30:46.550
[DWAYNE] UH YEAH, WE MET.

30:46.590 --> 30:48.800
[JAKE] OOH!

30:48.840 --> 30:51.970

30:52.010 --> 30:55.020
[MALACHY] SO YOU'RE SAYING
CRYSTAL PLANTED THAT
IN CARL'S HEAD?

30:56.480 --> 30:57.980
[JAKE] YEAH.

30:58.020 --> 31:01.020
&lt;♪♪&gt;

31:03.480 --> 31:06.610
[CARL] YOU WERE ALWAYS SUCH
A SOOK, YOU KNOW THAT?

31:06.650 --> 31:07.950
THAT'S MY FAULT.

31:07.990 --> 31:09.320
I NEVER SMACKED YOU AROUND
ENOUGH AS A YOUNGSTER,

31:09.360 --> 31:10.780
I S'POSE.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.870
WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND IN THE
DEATH THREATS TO THE COPPERS?

31:12.910 --> 31:14.160
[BOBBY] YOU'D KILL ME
IF I TOLD THE COPS.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.080
[CARL] THEY'D HAVE PUT ME BACK
IN PRISON THE SECOND

31:16.120 --> 31:20.120
YOU'D TOLD THEM I WAS SENDING

31:35.010 --> 31:37.930
WE GOT LOADED BUDDY,

31:37.980 --> 31:39.690
TWO BROTHERS DRINKING,
HAVING A GRAND TIME?

31:39.730 --> 31:43.440
[BOBBY] LEAVE ME ALONE CARL!
[CARL] WE GOT LOADED,

31:43.480 --> 31:45.650
I TOLD YOU ME AND MELISSA

31:45.690 --> 31:49.030

PUNCHED ME IN THE MOUTH

31:49.070 --> 31:50.950

31:54.240 --> 31:55.450
I NEVER COULD!

31:55.490 --> 31:58.410
[CARL] EASY, YOU'RE SQUEALING

31:58.450 --> 32:00.120

32:00.160 --> 32:01.920
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

32:10.300 --> 32:12.010

32:16.600 --> 32:18.220
[DES] BOB TRIED TO GIVE THAT TO
HIS SISTER YESTERDAY.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.980
SHE WOULDN'T TAKE IT.
[JAKE] BOB WHAT?

32:21.020 --> 32:23.310
[DES] BOB TRIED GIVING THAT TO
HIS SISTER YESTERDAY.

32:23.350 --> 32:25.690
SHE WOULDN'T TAKE IT.
[JAKE] IT'S FROM MELISSA

32:25.730 --> 32:28.940
TO CRYSTAL:
"I'M SO SORRY YOU THINK WE'RE

32:28.990 --> 32:31.990
ABANDONING YOU. I FORGIVE YOU
FOR THE GOSSIP. I FORGIVE YOU

32:32.030 --> 32:35.070
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE. THERE'D
NEVER BE ANYTHING BETWEEN ME

32:35.120 --> 32:36.450
AND BOBBY EVER.

32:36.490 --> 32:37.790
THERE NEVER WAS".

32:37.830 --> 32:39.540
[ROSE] WHY WOULD BOBBY KEEP THAT
LETTER ALL THESE YEARS?

32:39.580 --> 32:42.040
[JAKE] BECAUSE I THINK BOB WAS
TRYING TO PROTECT HIS SISTER?

32:42.080 --> 32:44.500
&lt;HIS CELL PHONE RINGS&gt;
SORRY.

32:44.540 --> 32:45.630
SORRY.

32:53.130 --> 32:56.760
[JAKE] I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.180
&lt;GUN SHOT&gt;

32:59.100 --> 33:02.190
[BOBBY] SCREW YOU, YOU BASTARD!
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;

33:02.230 --> 33:03.270
[JAKE] I GOTTA GO.

33:03.310 --> 33:04.190
[TINNY] THAT'S IT?

33:04.230 --> 33:05.270
[JAKE] WHAT?

33:05.310 --> 33:06.810
[TINNY] THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT
TO SAY?

33:06.860 --> 33:08.070
[JAKE] OKAY, TINNY, WHAT?

33:08.110 --> 33:10.780

33:10.820 --> 33:13.070
YOU'RE A KEEPER.

33:13.110 --> 33:14.490
HE'S A KEEPER.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.620
[ROSE] NO!

33:20.660 --> 33:22.210
YOU STINK, GO.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.120
[MALACHY] ROSE...

33:23.160 --> 33:24.080
USE THE GOOD KNIFE.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.130
[ROSE] I COULDN'T FIND
THE GOOD KNIFE.

33:38.720 --> 33:43.180
[DWAYNE] YOU GOTTA DO BOTH
SIDES.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.100
[MALACHY] WHAT DID YOU SAY?
[DWAYNE] MY DAD USED TO SAY,

33:46.150 --> 33:50.320
"IF YOU WANT THE KNIFE TO CARVE
TRUE YOU GOTTA DO BOTH SIDES".

33:50.360 --> 33:52.530
[MALACHY] I HAVE TO GO.
[ROSE] MAL.

33:52.570 --> 33:54.240
[TINNY] SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO
TALK ABOUT IT?

33:54.280 --> 33:55.400
AT ALL?

33:55.450 --> 33:57.530
[MALACHY] TINNY,
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

33:57.570 --> 34:01.240
AND YOU, NEXT TIME I SEE YOU I
CAN'T PROMISE I WON'T STAB YOU.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.290
[DES] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

34:13.260 --> 34:15.260
[CRYSTAL] WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

34:18.260 --> 34:20.100
YOU DON'T HAVE A WARRANT!

34:20.140 --> 34:21.680
[MALACHY] DON'T NEED ONE.

34:21.720 --> 34:23.100
I'M NOT A COP.

34:29.690 --> 34:32.280
THE KNIFE THAT SUPPOSEDLY
KILLED MELISSA DIDN'T HAVE
NICKS OR CUTS

34:32.320 --> 34:34.240
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T
SHARPENED ON A CUTTING STONE.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.950
LIKE THESE WERE.

34:36.990 --> 34:38.820
DID YOU BRING IT BACK HOME
WITH YOU?

34:38.870 --> 34:40.870
RUN IT THROUGH THE DISHWASHER?

34:41.530 --> 34:43.160
WHERE IS IT?

34:44.950 --> 34:46.330
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT!

34:46.370 --> 34:48.000
TELL ME!

34:49.170 --> 34:52.550
[CRYSTAL] &lt;CRYING&gt;
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

34:57.090 --> 34:59.090
PLEASE DON'T TELL CARL.

35:01.140 --> 35:07.190
&lt;♪♪&gt;

35:07.230 --> 35:09.980
[JAKE] BOB?!

35:10.020 --> 35:12.320
BOBBY?!

35:12.360 --> 35:15.190
BOB?!

35:15.230 --> 35:16.860

35:21.660 --> 35:22.660
[CARL] &lt;O.S.&gt; IT'S CARL!

35:22.700 --> 35:23.830
NOW RUN ALONG, DOYLE.

35:23.870 --> 35:24.910
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

35:24.950 --> 35:25.830
[JAKE] OH DEADLY.

35:25.870 --> 35:27.370
BOTH OF THE CRAZIES GOT GUNS.

35:27.410 --> 35:29.830
[CARL] THIS IS A FAMILY PROBLEM
NOW, DOYLE!

35:29.870 --> 35:31.330
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

35:31.380 --> 35:36.210
&lt;GUN SHOT&gt;
[CARL] STILL A BIG PACK RAT,

35:36.260 --> 35:39.470
BOB?

35:39.510 --> 35:42.050
IS THERE ANYTHING FOR ME
OR WHAT?

35:42.090 --> 35:43.260
SOMETHING FOR THE HOUSE?

35:43.300 --> 35:46.310
[BOBBY] GO TO HELL, CARL!
&lt;JAKE'S CELL PHONE RINGS&gt;

35:46.350 --> 35:48.600
[CARL] SHE WAS MY WIFE,
BASTARD!

35:48.640 --> 35:50.270
NOT YOURS!

35:50.310 --> 35:51.400
[JAKE] &lt;INTO PHONE&gt; DAD?

35:51.440 --> 35:54.360
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY A VERY GOOD
TIME, RIGHT NOW.

35:54.400 --> 35:57.650
&lt;GUN SHOT&gt;
[JAKE] WHAT?

35:57.690 --> 36:00.200
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;
[JAKE] OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

36:00.240 --> 36:03.490
&lt;GUN SHOTS&gt;
[BOBBY] SORRY!

36:03.530 --> 36:05.490
SORRY! SORRY!

36:05.530 --> 36:06.450
I WAS SHOOTING AT CARL!

36:06.490 --> 36:07.700
&lt;GUN SHOT&gt;

36:09.410 --> 36:12.790
[JAKE] OKAY, EVERYBODY JUST
RELAX, ALRIGHT?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.840
[CARL] DOYLE, STEP AWAY.
[JAKE] CARL, YOU GOTTA LISTEN

36:17.880 --> 36:19.010
TO ME, OKAY?

36:19.050 --> 36:21.430
[CARL] I'M JUST GONNA MAIM HIM
UP A BIT.

36:21.470 --> 36:23.300
LEAST I CAN DO,
HE KILLED MY WIFE!

36:23.340 --> 36:25.390
[JAKE] HE DIDN'T KILL
ANYBODY, YOU MORON.
JUST PUT YOUR GUN DOWN,

36:25.430 --> 36:27.430
PUT IT DOWN.
PUT YOUR GUN DOWN!
PUT 'EM DOWN!

36:27.470 --> 36:29.600
[CARL] YEAH RIGHT.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.150
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, JUST MEET ME
BACK AT YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE.

36:33.190 --> 36:34.690
I THINK I CAN EXPLAIN ALL THIS.

36:34.730 --> 36:36.520
ALRIGHT?

36:36.570 --> 36:37.650
WALKING OUT.

36:37.690 --> 36:40.400
NO ONE SHOOTING.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.070
NO ONE SHOOTING.

36:42.110 --> 36:43.360
[CARL] GO ON BOY, GO ON.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.030
WE'RE FINE.

36:48.410 --> 36:51.210
[JAKE] MELISSA WASN'T GUILTY
OF ANYTHING CARL,

36:51.250 --> 36:53.290
AND NEITHER WAS YOUR BROTHER.
WELL...

36:53.330 --> 36:58.380
ASIDE FROM BEING
PRETTY WEIRD AND IN LOVE
WITH YOUR WIFE.

36:58.420 --> 37:01.170
[MALACHY] YOU AND MELISSA
WERE GOING TO MOVE AWAY
AND START OVER.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.430
[JAKE] MELISSA WROTE THAT
LETTER TO CRYSTAL AND BOBBY

37:03.470 --> 37:07.100
GOT A HOLD OF IT. BUT THE
QUESTION IS, WHY DID YOU HAVE

37:07.140 --> 37:09.060
IT ALL THESE YEARS, BOB?

37:09.100 --> 37:10.770
AND NOT TELL ANYONE?

37:10.810 --> 37:13.940
WHO WERE YOU TRYING TO PROTECT?

37:13.980 --> 37:17.190
[CRYSTAL] I'M SORRY, CARL.

37:17.230 --> 37:20.110
I'M SO SORRY.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.570
[BOBBY] WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO
DO?

37:21.610 --> 37:25.240
SHE WAS A KID,
OUR LITTLE SISTER.

37:25.280 --> 37:32.620
[CRYSTAL] ALL THESE YEARS.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.710
I'M SO SORRY.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.580
[MOTHER MAHER] PUT THAT AWAY.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.250
AWAY, NOBODY NEEDS TO SEE.

37:39.300 --> 37:47.390
NOBODY... CAN'T.
[CARL] NO.

37:47.430 --> 37:49.390
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

37:49.430 --> 37:52.930
[MALACHY] CRYSTAL TOLD YOUR
MOTHER YOU WERE LEAVING.

37:52.980 --> 37:58.520
[MOTHER MAHER] YOU CAN'T TAKE
MY CARL AWAY...

37:58.560 --> 38:06.490
HE'S MY BABY &lt;CRYING&gt;.

38:06.530 --> 38:08.530
MELISSA!
NO!

38:08.570 --> 38:11.490
[CARL] THAT'S CRYSTAL, MOTHER.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.540
MELISSA'S GONE.
[MOTHER MAHER] GONE ALRIGHT.

38:14.580 --> 38:17.710
I TOOK IT, AND I CLEANED IT UP
RIGHT.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.840
NOBODY WILL SEE.

38:19.880 --> 38:24.010
[CARL] WHAT DID YOU DO MOTHER?

38:24.050 --> 38:26.550
[MOTHER MAHER] I WON'T LOOSE
HIM TO THE LIKES OF YOU.

38:26.590 --> 38:29.430
YOU BITCH.

38:29.470 --> 38:35.350
I'D RATHER SEE HIM ROT.

38:56.580 --> 38:59.500
[CARL] NO WORRIES, MOTHER.

38:59.540 --> 39:04.800
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

39:04.840 --> 39:12.640
[MALACHY] CARL,
WE SHOULD TELL THE POLICE.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.810
[JAKE] IT'S TRUE CARL.

39:15.850 --> 39:17.350
SHE'LL NEVER STAND TRIAL ANYWAY.

39:17.390 --> 39:19.230
NOT IN HER CONDITION.

39:19.270 --> 39:21.400
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR NAME CLEARED.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.570
[CARL] THIS DOESN'T LEAVE
THE ROOM.

39:23.610 --> 39:26.360
[JAKE] CARL.
[CARL] THIS DOESN'T LEAVE
THE ROOM!

39:28.530 --> 39:31.620
IF YOU TELLS ANYONE,
I'LL DENY IT.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.700
AND I'LL COME AFTER THE BOTH
OF YOUS, I SWEAR I WILL.

39:33.740 --> 39:35.950
I SWEAR TO GOD.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.410
OKAY?

39:37.450 --> 39:40.790
[BOBBY] WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

39:40.830 --> 39:43.340
BETTER THAN SHE EVER TOOK CARE
OF US.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.460
[CARL] YOU DONE YOUR JOB.

39:45.500 --> 39:48.470
BUT THIS IS A FAMILY PROBLEM
NOW, DOYLES.

39:48.510 --> 39:52.720
I OWES YOUS FELLAS

39:52.760 --> 39:55.180
[MALACHY] TIME AND EXPENSES AT

39:55.220 --> 39:56.060
SEVEN GRAND.

39:56.100 --> 40:01.100

40:01.150 --> 40:03.480
I MISJUDGED YOU, CARL.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.440
I'M SORRY.

40:05.480 --> 40:10.320
[CARL] I APPRECIATE THAT,
COPPER.

40:10.360 --> 40:11.700
AND IF YOUS KEEP THE SECRET,

40:11.740 --> 40:13.160
WE'RE SQUARE.

40:13.200 --> 40:17.240

40:21.080 --> 40:23.210
PADING OUT THOSE EXPENSES
A BIT, YOU KNOW,

40:23.250 --> 40:25.250

[MALACHY] JAKE?

40:37.890 --> 40:39.980
