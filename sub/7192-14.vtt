00:04.963 --> 00:06.297
- I've made a decision.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.424
- Oh, me too.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.591
I am done eating corn dogs.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.385
You know, I always think
I'm gonna like them,

00:10.468 --> 00:11.469
but then I get the breading
stuck in my teeth--

00:11.553 --> 00:12.929
- I think...

00:13.012 --> 00:14.013
No...

00:14.097 --> 00:14.889
I <i> know</i>
I can bring my mom back.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.891
I don't care what it takes.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.852
I'm going to do it.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.103
- I--I don't understand--
- Which part?

00:20.186 --> 00:22.480
- The part where you think
you can do that.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.982
Em, you can't.

00:24.065 --> 00:24.941
- I can!

00:25.024 --> 00:26.109
I mean, I still have

00:26.192 --> 00:27.444
to fine-tune the spell, but--

00:27.527 --> 00:29.612
- No, I know you "can"
like, "physically able."

00:29.696 --> 00:31.114
I meant you shouldn't.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.450
- When did Andi
turn into such a wimp?

00:33.533 --> 00:34.784
It used to be,

00:34.868 --> 00:36.786
"Use your powers
and give me wings."

00:36.870 --> 00:38.955
"Use your powers and give
Maddie an atomic wedgie."

00:39.038 --> 00:40.415
Now you're all...

00:40.498 --> 00:43.334
"Emma, don't use your powers,
could be dangerous!"

00:43.418 --> 00:44.502
- Wha--okay.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.004
First of all,
I do not sound like that.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.881
And second of all,
I'm not turning into a wimp;

00:47.964 --> 00:49.466
I'm just getting smarter,

00:49.549 --> 00:50.717
learning
from my past mistakes.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.969
- I can't believe you're
not excited about this.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.722
This is my mother!
- I know, Em, but...

00:55.805 --> 00:57.098
messing with the universe
like that?

00:57.182 --> 00:59.142
- The universe
messed with me first!

00:59.225 --> 01:00.894
By taking her away from me.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.395
I'm just making things right.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.063
You don't understand.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.316
Because you have a mom.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.609
- No, Em, I get it.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.320
Look, I really do.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.281
But you're trying to go beyond
what any person should do,

01:13.364 --> 01:14.407
even a super-powerful witch.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.786
- So...you're not
going to help me?

01:17.869 --> 01:20.121
- I'm sorry, Emma.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.456
I'm not.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.665
- Fine.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.167
But don't try to stop me.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.293
- Emma...

01:25.376 --> 01:27.170
- Either you're with me
or against me.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.380
- Okay, I think somebody
has been playing

01:29.464 --> 01:30.924
"Galactic Warmongers 7"
too much

01:31.007 --> 01:32.509
because they say that
in Level--

01:32.592 --> 01:33.343
- You don't want
to find out how I deal

01:33.426 --> 01:35.178
with people who go against me.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.304
- Is that a threat?

01:36.387 --> 01:37.722
- Maybe.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.515
- Well, "maybe"
you should take that back.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.558
- Fine.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.894
It wasn't "maybe" a threat.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.813
It definitely was.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.022
- Oh, really?

01:46.105 --> 01:47.690
And what are you gonna do,
tele-transport me?

01:47.774 --> 01:50.235
Please try, because I'd love
to take a dip in the pool.

how to do this.

that we were the last ones.

Mia's address in Vero Beach,

06:11.621 --> 06:14.665

and you could pop up there

it's "Canadians."
