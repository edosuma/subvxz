12:32.030 --> 12:35.102
You know why I didn't
want to see you, Mother?

12:35.872 --> 12:37.740
Why I don't return your phone calls?

12:39.117 --> 12:40.742
'Cause every time I look into your eyes,

12:40.743 --> 12:43.556

I see and hear what I feel about myself.

12:47.785 --> 12:50.288
You are my confirmation.

12:52.964 --> 12:54.691
You have to let me go, Mother,

12:54.692 --> 12:57.192
because no matter how badly you feel

12:57.193 --> 13:00.196
or guilty or angry or sad or ashamed...

13:00.197 --> 13:02.064
I have never been ashamed of you, never.

13:02.065 --> 13:03.765
Or ashamed of yourself, then.

13:03.766 --> 13:06.936

I can't abandon you, honey. I won't.

13:17.081 --> 13:19.068
I'm not asking you to.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.403
I'm asking you to let me go.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.046
I'm asking you to do

13:25.950 --> 13:28.890
what you have been wanting
so desperately to do.

13:29.791 --> 13:31.246
And what is that?

13:33.773 --> 13:35.242
To be free.

13:36.927 --> 13:38.735
Free of bondage.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.087
And what about you?
What about your bondage, Daniel?

13:43.330 --> 13:44.925
It's not your problem.

Can't decide between the
Michelins and the Bridgestones.

15:00.321 --> 15:02.918
Got the Michelins on mine
for what it's worth.

15:03.588 --> 15:04.920
I guess it's no coincidence

15:04.921 --> 15:07.008
those are the more expensive of the two.

I didn't take it that way.

I can sell you the Bridgestones
for a cool $200 each.

That's $10 off the regular.

Why would you think that?
I'd be thrilled.

18:06.762 --> 18:08.176
That's why.

already stated rather strongly

I get... I get
this kind of memory of her.

a-a feeling or an experience

get it over with, frankly.

may take years in the courts,

No, I'm just being straight
with you, Sondra,

23:52.403 --> 23:54.404
that that is what is going to happen,

23:54.405 --> 23:56.739
not because we're coming
after you personally,

23:56.740 --> 23:58.074
but because of all the evidence

23:58.075 --> 24:00.279
that has come to light
since the plea deal.

24:01.078 --> 24:04.946
Because we believe now that
if the plea deal is vacated,

24:04.947 --> 24:06.816
there is no way you or any other D.A.

24:06.817 --> 24:08.736
will ever retry Daniel Holden.

between him and Foulkes,

24:31.617 --> 24:34.743
My client was originally
convicted 20 years ago

24:34.744 --> 24:36.244
on what I believe
was a coerced confession

24:36.245 --> 24:38.247
and the testimony of two men
who we now know

24:38.248 --> 24:39.749

Ms. Dean was raped
and strangled to death

24:49.760 --> 24:52.296
and then sent home
without being questioned.

If it were so easy, Mr. Stern.

25:36.807 --> 25:38.974
But the only way that can have
a chance of happening

25:38.975 --> 25:41.978
is for someone without
a vested interest to come in.

25:41.979 --> 25:44.180
Let the chips fall where they may.

25:44.181 --> 25:46.883
The chips never fall well for the one

25:46.884 --> 25:48.216
who has to clean up the mess.

25:48.217 --> 25:50.219
I think you're wrong there, Sondra.

25:50.220 --> 25:52.087
If you see this all the way to the end,

25:52.088 --> 25:54.703
reasonable people will think
the better of you for it.

25:57.511 --> 26:01.161
You have a higher regard

Uh, no. No, ma'am.

28:08.743 --> 28:11.661
Um, I work at Pineridge...

28:11.662 --> 28:14.396
where Mr. Bowers was.

28:15.238 --> 28:16.499
"Was"?

28:16.500 --> 28:18.466
He passed away this morning.

28:19.370 --> 28:21.232
Lord, have mercy.

28:23.173 --> 28:24.909
Why you here now?

28:26.891 --> 28:29.545
Mr. Zeke, wanted me
to get his plaque for him,

28:29.546 --> 28:31.947
but I... I wasn't able to.

28:32.828 --> 28:36.035
I just wanted to see it
for myself, I guess.

28:37.885 --> 28:39.587
The one from his work?

28:39.949 --> 28:41.691
Yes, ma'am.

28:42.287 --> 28:43.993
I know where he keeps it.

28:53.270 --> 28:56.007
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

29:12.688 --> 29:14.222
Well, I'm going.

29:14.223 --> 29:16.224
Oh.

29:16.225 --> 29:17.559
Okay.

29:19.153 --> 29:20.495
You gonna lock up?

29:21.714 --> 29:24.200
Um, I will.

29:24.201 --> 29:27.703
Guess we just leave the key
in that frog.

29:28.735 --> 29:30.705
Are... are you coming back?

29:31.308 --> 29:33.075
Well, he paid me six months in advance,

29:33.076 --> 29:34.979
and it's been seven now.

29:36.713 --> 29:39.714
Do you... do you know
if he had any family?

29:40.261 --> 29:41.716
I never saw any personally,

29:41.717 --> 29:45.020
but he said he had a nephew in, um...

29:45.021 --> 29:46.355
Arizona?

29:46.963 --> 29:48.283
That sounds right.

29:53.329 --> 29:56.432
Well, uh, it was good
to meet you, Bonnie.

29:56.433 --> 29:58.102
You too.

30:00.687 --> 30:02.372
Why don't you keep that plaque?

30:03.673 --> 30:06.509
Don't look like nobody else
gonna want it.

30:06.510 --> 30:08.378
Maybe I will.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.519

You say your prayers,
you'll be all right.

30:28.447 --> 30:30.300
Bye, now.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.505
Bye.

It must be inspiring being here.

30:49.073 --> 30:51.235
Sometimes you become inured.

30:52.722 --> 30:55.459
You can become inured
to a lot of things.

30:59.664 --> 31:02.097
What was your son like before?

31:03.259 --> 31:04.799
Daniel said you were direct.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.337
To a fault sometimes.
If you're not comfortable...

31:08.338 --> 31:10.056
No. (CHUCKLES)

31:11.207 --> 31:16.511
I still see that boy in him,
that burgeoning man.

31:17.184 --> 31:20.519
He was sensitive, rebellious,

31:21.693 --> 31:25.186
wise beyond his years
and yet fully adolescent.

31:26.199 --> 31:28.856
Like most mothers,
I thought he hung the moon.

31:29.525 --> 31:32.041
Sometimes, I still think he might have.

31:33.096 --> 31:35.510
I don't think
it's just a mother's slant.

31:36.133 --> 31:39.650
He is... special.

31:41.404 --> 31:43.299
I'm glad you took a chance on him,

31:43.906 --> 31:46.442
even if you are going away

31:50.813 --> 31:53.348

that approach with me today,

31:53.349 --> 31:55.067
so I'm taking his cue.

31:58.155 --> 32:00.424
Do you think he'll make it?

32:02.826 --> 32:05.828
What does that mean, Janet, to you?

32:07.007 --> 32:08.497
Will he ever be happy?

32:09.674 --> 32:11.232
Are you happy?

32:12.852 --> 32:14.283
Sometimes.

32:14.771 --> 32:16.166
So is he.

32:24.614 --> 32:26.481
Have you been talking about me?

32:26.835 --> 32:28.137
Of course.

32:30.486 --> 32:31.654
Is Ted coming?

32:31.655 --> 32:34.289
No. He texted me.

32:34.290 --> 32:35.790
I didn't even know he could text.

32:35.791 --> 32:38.327
Said he took a cab to Camden, Tennessee,

32:38.328 --> 32:40.195
to see where Patsy Cline died.

32:40.196 --> 32:41.529
He won't be back until late.

32:41.530 --> 32:43.632
I think that's like 100 miles away.

32:43.633 --> 32:47.770

must have been disappointing.

32:47.771 --> 32:49.980
Do you like Thai food, Mother?

33:11.828 --> 33:13.828
I wouldn't think forks, either.

Nope.

33:15.999 --> 33:18.901

33:18.902 --> 33:22.270
Well, I am a very competent

If you want my opinion.

34:15.668 --> 34:17.297
Okay.

34:17.299 --> 34:19.800
But I'd like to set Teddy up
with the inventory

34:19.801 --> 34:22.335
and the equipment
if that's what he wants.

34:22.337 --> 34:23.530

in any way that we can.

34:43.860 --> 34:45.594
I don't know.

But I know we can't
keep going on the way we are.

Thank you, Chloe, for all this.

35:31.206 --> 35:33.844
It felt like living.

It may run you off,
but that is not my intention.

36:03.206 --> 36:05.007
Why won't you go into therapy?

36:06.409 --> 36:10.610
Real, targeted, specific therapy
for your issues.

36:12.969 --> 36:14.649
Because I'm not ready yet.

36:14.650 --> 36:15.933
When will you be?

36:15.934 --> 36:17.852
Mid-2023.

36:17.853 --> 36:20.721
Seriously, when?

36:20.722 --> 36:22.457
Probably never, Chloe.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.622
Then why not start now?

36:25.760 --> 36:28.629
Because it would be way too much fun,

36:28.630 --> 36:30.364
and I'm no good at fun.

36:30.365 --> 36:32.901

36:34.083 --> 36:37.504
And frankly, um, I-I don't see you

36:37.505 --> 36:41.161
as the most shining example
for the benefits of therapy.

a good chunk of time

36:57.994 --> 36:59.333
I really do.

Chloe, alliteration aside.

37:06.314 --> 37:08.050
Have a good night, Daniel.

37:17.563 --> 37:20.503
Because there's too much shit
to dredge up.

37:21.584 --> 37:23.598
And I don't want to relive it.

37:23.599 --> 37:28.469
I don't... I don't think
I can handle it.

37:28.470 --> 37:30.839
I can barely handle life now.

37:30.840 --> 37:35.375
Look, I know it must be
terribly difficult

37:35.376 --> 37:40.248
to even contemplate facing
the very real traumas

37:40.249 --> 37:41.482
that you endured.

37:42.344 --> 37:44.819
But I've thought about this a lot,

37:44.820 --> 37:47.822
and I think that there's something else

37:47.823 --> 37:49.123
that's stopping you.

37:50.367 --> 37:54.628
I don't know. It just feels
like you created this identity.

37:54.629 --> 37:57.632
You had to... I understand
that... to survive.

37:57.633 --> 37:59.333
I mean, you were barely 18.

37:59.334 --> 38:01.435
You weren't even fully formed yet.

38:01.436 --> 38:04.772
So you became what they said you were.

38:04.773 --> 38:07.174
And you played the part,

38:07.175 --> 38:09.377
and you lived the life
of death-row Daniel.

38:09.378 --> 38:12.346
Tell me something I don't know, Chloe.

38:12.347 --> 38:16.518
I don't know if I can,

38:16.519 --> 38:19.654
but there is this shame all around you,

38:19.655 --> 38:21.656
all the time.

38:21.657 --> 38:23.290
And you don't want to let it go

38:23.291 --> 38:26.293
because if you are always
and already the bad boy,

38:26.294 --> 38:28.795
then no one can hurt you.

38:28.796 --> 38:30.498
But if you start to
feel good about yourself,

38:30.499 --> 38:34.201
just a little bit,
even just these brief moments

38:34.202 --> 38:38.706
of "I think I am an okay person,"

38:38.707 --> 38:41.241
then that must be
truly terrifying for you.

38:41.242 --> 38:45.580
Because what protects you then
from the slings and arrows?

38:45.581 --> 38:47.915
You're one to talk, Chloe.

38:47.916 --> 38:50.284
I know I'm one to talk.

38:50.285 --> 38:51.953
We can talk about me
being the one to talk

38:51.954 --> 38:53.554
some other time.

38:53.555 --> 38:56.424
But right now, I am telling you,

38:56.425 --> 38:59.594
if you are unwilling
to let go of that self-image,

38:59.595 --> 39:02.931
of that shame, of that Daniel
that you had to create

39:02.932 --> 39:04.898
to save yourself back then,

39:04.899 --> 39:09.805
then I am afraid you will not
be able to save yourself now.

39:11.941 --> 39:15.275
And then you will never know
who you truly are.

39:17.312 --> 39:19.390
Isn't that why we're here?

39:23.352 --> 39:25.295
Why we are doing this.

39:26.521 --> 39:28.159
Talk about a waste.

39:32.294 --> 39:33.858
I have to go.

39:37.599 --> 39:39.334

No.
