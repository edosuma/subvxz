Me?

04:42.240 --> 04:44.038
(Wry chuckle)

04:44.201 --> 04:48.798
Our land has been conquered
by a barbaric race.

We would like you to escort
the present heirto the throne

04:52.250 --> 04:55.379
back to our people in Spain
so she can help to lead the army

04:55.545 --> 04:57.422
and overthrow the barbarians.

04:57.589 --> 05:02.140
For many years, a great number
of poor people has sacrificed

- For what?

direct descendant
of one of our most noble families.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.753
And we're willing to pay any amount

05:32.207 --> 05:34.710
Well, I don't know who you are,

05:34.876 --> 05:38.301
and I don't know nothin'
about no barbarians.

05:38.463 --> 05:43.219
Hell, I don't even know where
this place Spain is you're talkin' about.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.763

05:53.144 --> 05:56.990
lady, I'll take you any goddamn place
you want to go.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.197
Is that the kind of respect
you show for royalty?

06:03.989 --> 06:07.334
Look...

06:07.492 --> 06:10.837
business is business,

06:10.996 --> 06:14.717
and I happen to be
a businessman.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.468
And besides,

06:16.626 --> 06:19.721
if I really thought
you were a princess,

06:19.880 --> 06:22.224
well, I'd ask for $100,000.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.893
- What's that?
- It was built by the Moors

09:12.052 --> 09:13.895
when they came here
years ago

09:14.054 --> 09:16.933
to help my people
conquer the barbarians.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.978
In this place, they once kept
the treasure of Rodrigo.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.523
- The what?
- The treasure of Rodrigo.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.844

10:11.528 --> 10:12.700
(exhales sharply)

10:29.838 --> 10:31.465
Who's that?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.725
Our enemies, the barbarians.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.227
What about them?

10:36.386 --> 10:38.764
- The Moors.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.568

Best we get the hell
out of here.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.276
Get your stuff.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.905
Them's the barbarians, right?

11:42.452 --> 11:44.625
And them's the Moors, right?

11:44.787 --> 11:46.039
Yes.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.050
(exhales sharply)

12:35.213 --> 12:37.466
Now, this is a dangerous country.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.181
They're fightin' everywhere.
Let's go. Come on.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.095
Come on!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.809
Wait!

12:43.972 --> 12:48.398
That's the Moorish army.
They've come to help my people.

12:48.559 --> 12:52.154

- What do you want me to do?

12:52.313 --> 12:54.566

12:54.732 --> 12:56.905
And I command you
to shut up, lady,

18:41.162 --> 18:43.415
You don't understand
who you're speaking to!

18:43.581 --> 18:47.256
No, you are the one
who doesn't understand.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.513

Elizabeth Maria de Borgos.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.014
( Groans)

18:58.888 --> 19:01.016
Let me welcome you to Spain

19:01.182 --> 19:04.982
and offer you the hospitality
of my humble house.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.273
I accept nothing
that is already mine.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.533
I am the rightful ruler
of this land.

19:10.691 --> 19:14.286
You own nothing
but the army of that man!

19:14.445 --> 19:15.742
Look.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.380
This little woman here
fell off her horse

19:24.538 --> 19:27.712
a few days back
and hurt her head.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.344
Now she's crazy.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.893
Ah, come on, you guys.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.180

she's a princess,

19:40.346 --> 19:42.440
you're all crazy.

19:42.598 --> 19:46.478
She's not a princess,
she's an ill-bred bitch!

19:46.644 --> 19:47.941
Just hold on there.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.948
I'm supposed to get $50,000

19:51.107 --> 19:54.737
for delivering her,
whatever she is.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.745
How much is that?

19:56.904 --> 20:01.159
It would buy you 2,000 horses.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.669
Stupid foreigners.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.798
You <i>come</i> to my country,

20:15.715 --> 20:18.514
I've told you a hundred times <i>--</i>

20:18.676 --> 20:24.228
You must never lose control
in front of the men.

20:24.390 --> 20:28.020

Hang him!

20:58.799 --> 21:00.016

21:07.057 --> 21:09.901
Now, let's talk this thing over.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.937
We can make a deal.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.607
Hell, <i>I'll</i> take $25,000.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.784
Hey, come back here!
Where are you going?

22:06.951 --> 22:11.297
Where are you going,
you bunch of foreigners?

22:11.455 --> 22:14.755
You can't treat a man like this!

22:14.917 --> 22:17.636
Hey! Cut me down!

27:14.258 --> 27:17.182
Listen, ask him
about my money, will ya?

27:17.344 --> 27:19.142
There's no way to pay you

27:19.304 --> 27:22.148
until Rodrigo's treasure
has been found.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.561
Look, lady, a deal's a deal.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.025

who can claim the treasure.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.313
Now, nobody get nervous...

33:41.937 --> 33:44.065
because I come in peace.

33:59.079 --> 34:04.586
Take a look at this stuff, Chief.

34:04.751 --> 34:09.257
Beads. Pretty beads.

34:09.422 --> 34:12.972
- ( Beads rattle on table )
- ( groans )

34:13.134 --> 34:14.556
<i>0k3Y-</i>

34:16.513 --> 34:20.643
How 'bout a new kind
of looking glass...

34:22.811 --> 34:27.157
I bring from big country <i>--</i>
America.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.737
( Groans)

34:31.527 --> 34:33.530
Don't be shy. Take it.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.538
All right.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.172
How 'bout this?

34:49.004 --> 34:50.847
That's a nice hat for your wife.

34:51.005 --> 34:54.179
I have six wives.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.531
Oh, looks like you've been robbing
the cradle, there, Chief.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.407
(exclaims)

35:15.822 --> 35:17.950
You insult me!

35:21.661 --> 35:23.413
First you demand

35:23.580 --> 35:26.584
I pay $50,000 for the princess!

35:32.547 --> 35:34.675
Then...

35:34.841 --> 35:36.969
you kill six <i>--</i>

35:37.135 --> 35:39.354
six of my men!

35:42.057 --> 35:43.980
And now...

35:44.142 --> 35:46.486
you dare to tell me...

35:46.645 --> 35:49.489
( chuckling )

35:49.648 --> 35:53.027
you come in peace!

35:53.193 --> 35:54.740
(shouting )

35:54.903 --> 35:58.828
If he kills me,
you'll never get your treasure!

35:58.990 --> 36:01.539
Treasure? What treasure?

36:01.701 --> 36:04.250
The treasure of Rodrigo.

36:04.412 --> 36:07.632
Where? Where is it?
Give it to me!

36:07.791 --> 36:12.718
I ain't givin' him nothin'.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.257
You tell him I'll trade him even up <i>--</i>

36:15.423 --> 36:17.221
the princess for the treasure.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.388
- I'll kill you!
- Diego!

36:31.314 --> 36:35.319
All right. Take him.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.203
He's yours.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.802
You'd better come with me.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.382
I think it's time
we had a little talk.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.927
Have you ever read Shakespeare?

36:57.090 --> 36:59.138
- Who?
- ( chuckles )

36:59.300 --> 37:02.349
No, I don't suppose
you would know him.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.685
( Chuckles )
Shakespeare.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.566
He wrote a great many plays--

37:06.725 --> 37:09.353
Hamlet, Othello, Richard III.

37:09.519 --> 37:12.238
( Chuckles )
Dear Richard.

37:12.397 --> 37:15.401
Richard was
a very interesting man.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.740
He was a hunchback.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.825
You might say...

37:19.988 --> 37:21.706
( chuckles)

37:21.865 --> 37:25.369
he is my idol.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.162
All right, Richard.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.922
(women giggling, exclaiming)

37:55.857 --> 37:57.905
Well, thank you.

38:06.659 --> 38:10.755
Oh, you son of a gun!

38:10.914 --> 38:14.214
But how do you pick one of them?

38:14.375 --> 38:16.048
Oh, they're not for me.

38:16.211 --> 38:21.638
( Chuckles )
They're for them.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.518
Mm-hmm!

38:29.557 --> 38:33.107
But don't they get nervous
with those guys watching up there?

38:33.269 --> 38:37.240
No, no. Those guys are blind.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.526
(man thinking)
This guy's a cripple.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.490
A hunchback.

38:41.653 --> 38:45.954
And he's crazy.
Completely crazy.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.914
But he must be doing
something right.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.249
Damn.

38:51.579 --> 38:55.049
I've been trying to make a deal
with the wrong guy.

38:55.208 --> 38:59.759
Tell me, do you like
what you have seen?

38:59.921 --> 39:01.969
Are you kiddin', Richard?

39:02.131 --> 39:05.135
I've been waitin' all my life
for somethin' like that.

39:05.301 --> 39:08.555
Well, perhaps I can arrange
for you to have it.

39:08.721 --> 39:09.893
Come with me.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.993
Sombra:
See?

39:30.159 --> 39:33.663
We have taken very good care
of your friend.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.924
Now perhaps we can reach some...

39:36.082 --> 39:38.084
agreement between us.

39:38.251 --> 39:40.003
( Crying out)

39:40.169 --> 39:42.171
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

39:42.338 --> 39:48.266
What about Diego?
Where does he fit into this thing?

39:48.428 --> 39:50.977
Never mind about Diego.

39:51.139 --> 39:54.484
This is between you and I.

39:59.981 --> 40:03.076
- Okay, Richard, I --
- My name is not Richard!

40:06.446 --> 40:08.119

.*:f_ j[L;.:_ rj lg 'ILL l}j:: F” 21251: ..

40:13.036 --> 40:15.459
Now, I know where the treasure is,

40:15.622 --> 40:18.125
but I need the little woman
to claim it.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.631
All right.

40:24.797 --> 40:29.849
I'll release her, and then we'll go
and claim it together...

40:30.011 --> 40:31.354
partner.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.496
Princess: I don't know what kind
of arrangement you have made,

40:52.659 --> 40:55.287
but I will not go anywhere
with this man.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.581
Now, look.

40:57.747 --> 41:00.296
I don't care nothin' about him,

41:00.458 --> 41:04.508
I don't care nothin' about that treasure,
and I don't care nothin' about you.

41:04.671 --> 41:07.140
You don't care nothing
about anything.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.891
Right.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.052
I just want to get my money

41:11.219 --> 41:15.224
and get out of this trashy
goddamn country of yours.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.984
But you know
we can't trust him.

41:18.142 --> 41:21.612
One thing at a time, lady.
One thing at a time.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.622
(exclaims)

41:59.809 --> 42:02.232
(all humming)

42:50.151 --> 42:54.998
How would you girls like to visit
the States someday?

42:55.156 --> 42:56.999
( Thinking )
Oh, dear God,

42:57.158 --> 43:00.753
they got some ugly-looking women
in this country.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.085
( Creaking )

43:03.247 --> 43:04.669
Sombra:
Hey, partner.

43:09.879 --> 43:12.428
I think you'd better come inside.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.434
I can't worry about danger.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.728
This is something I must do.

43:36.072 --> 43:37.164
<i>HEY-</i>

43:41.577 --> 43:43.420
Now, where do you think
you're going?

43:43.579 --> 43:45.832
This is not your affair.

43:45.998 --> 43:49.468
Look, lady,
until I get my money,

43:49.627 --> 43:51.629
everything's my affair.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.925
Now, somebody tell me what the hell's
going on around here.

43:55.091 --> 43:58.812
I'm sorry. This is one
of our most sacred traditions.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.849
The princess will not be able
to claim the treasure

44:02.014 --> 44:05.985
unless she makes the long journey
through the trials of death.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.738
- The what?
- Man: The trials of death,

44:08.896 --> 44:13.447
a venture full of magic
and the unknown.

44:13.609 --> 44:18.160
They are the only way
to claim Rodrigo's treasure.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.825
After many men had died
in the attempt,

44:20.992 --> 44:23.165
a time came when
no one else would try.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.501
So the tradition and the secret
of the treasure

44:26.664 --> 44:29.042
were lost and forgotten.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.676
Man:
Now, mister, you're crazy.

44:30.835 --> 44:33.805
We got a little woman here.

44:33.963 --> 44:37.888
Now, if all them guys got killed tryin',
how do you expect her to do it?

44:38.050 --> 44:39.768
She doesn't have to.

44:39.927 --> 44:43.272
If the heir apparent
is a woman or a child,

44:43.431 --> 44:46.184
a loyal subject
who must carry no weapon

44:46.350 --> 44:47.977
may be appointed instead.

44:48.144 --> 44:51.614
But she insists on going.

44:53.316 --> 44:58.743
I'm going,
and nobody can stop me.

44:58.905 --> 45:00.077
<i>Lady...</i>

45:04.368 --> 45:07.121
I'll not only stop you,

45:07.288 --> 45:11.964
but I'll break
your goddamn legs for you.

45:12.126 --> 45:15.380
Now, we got a problem here.

45:15.546 --> 45:20.347
We got a serious problem here.

45:20.509 --> 45:23.888
All right, what are we gonna do
about this thing?

45:24.055 --> 45:28.526
Well, I could certainly do
this kind of thing better than you.

45:28.684 --> 45:30.482
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

45:30.645 --> 45:34.195
However, there is
one small problem.

45:34.357 --> 45:35.859
What's that?

45:36.025 --> 45:38.995
Well, you know how it is
when one's crippled.

45:39.153 --> 45:45.035
You'll have some good days...
and some bad.

45:45.201 --> 45:48.296
And today is just one of those
bad days, right?

45:48.454 --> 45:49.922
Ah.

45:51.666 --> 45:55.136
You know, I'm really happy
you came along, partner.

45:55.294 --> 45:59.720
That's very nice
of you to say.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.805
All right, what do I have to do?

46:03.052 --> 46:04.269

(female voice laughing)

48:31.784 --> 48:34.207

48:34.370 --> 48:37.340
Now, all you people
in them coffins,

48:37.498 --> 48:41.844
I don't believe
in this kind of stuff.

48:42.002 --> 48:44.846
You hear me?

48:45.005 --> 48:48.851
So don't be trying to turn me
into no damn wolf.

53:13.107 --> 53:17.954
Now, what the hell
kind of treasure is that?

53:18.112 --> 53:21.662
Maybe it's old or something.

54:16.628 --> 54:17.845
(doors opening)

54:47.701 --> 54:49.999
There. You see?

54:50.162 --> 54:52.836
I told you.
They plotted together.

54:52.998 --> 54:55.592
Where is my treasure?

54:55.751 --> 54:57.549
( Chuckles)

55:00.339 --> 55:02.182
But, mister,

55:02.341 --> 55:05.265
now you've got to
get me a doctor,

55:05.427 --> 55:08.897
because I've turned black all over,
and I think I'm gonna die.

55:09.056 --> 55:10.308
Search him!

55:29.618 --> 55:32.371
Oh, my God!
Zepeda's necklace!

55:32.538 --> 55:35.041
- The Scorpion's Sting.
- Man: The what?

55:35.207 --> 55:37.084
It's called the Scorpion's Sting.

55:37.251 --> 55:41.097
Death comes to whoever claims it.
They say El Cid had it at Valencia.

55:41.255 --> 55:43.553
Three days later...

55:43.715 --> 55:45.217
he was dead!

55:45.384 --> 55:49.059
Shut up!
Give it to him!

55:49.221 --> 55:51.019
( Gasping )

55:54.935 --> 55:56.403
T-Take it.

55:56.562 --> 55:58.405
Take it.

55:58.564 --> 56:02.068
You take it, or I'll drive this dagger
through your black throat.

56:02.234 --> 56:04.987
All right.

56:05.153 --> 56:06.951
<i>I'll take it.</i>

Hell, that's a nice necklace.

(exclaims)

56:16.248 --> 56:20.674
- ( Sombra laughing )
- What?

56:20.836 --> 56:22.088
Nothing.
( chuckles )

56:22.254 --> 56:25.303
- It was nothing.
- Why do you laugh?

56:25.465 --> 56:28.184
Please, Diego.

56:28.343 --> 56:30.437
In another moment,
you'll lose your temper and he'll be dead,

56:30.596 --> 56:32.439
and then you'll never
find your treasure.

56:32.598 --> 56:35.943
Don't listen! Don't listen.
He tried to betray you.

56:36.101 --> 56:37.853
That's right, Diego.
Listen to

<i>H </i>

56:40.981 --> 56:42.779

of a new hat with feathers!

56:46.528 --> 56:48.030
Now, come.

56:48.196 --> 56:51.621
Come, sweet counselor.
Tell us.

56:51.783 --> 56:55.287
If I did betray Diego for the treasure,
where is it?!

56:55.454 --> 56:57.377
I...

56:59.499 --> 57:03.299
I d-- I don't know.

57:03.462 --> 57:07.057
That's right.
You don't know, do you?

57:07.215 --> 57:09.309
(Sombra cackles)

57:09.468 --> 57:11.891
You think that
Diego is a fool,

57:12.054 --> 57:14.148
that you can whisper anything
that you like into his ears

57:14.306 --> 57:19.187
and he will believe you <i>--</i>
well, you're wrong!

57:19.353 --> 57:22.323
Diego knows better than that.

57:22.481 --> 57:26.076
He knows that if I had this treasure
in my hands, I would bring it to him!

57:26.234 --> 57:29.283
- Bullshit.
- ( exclaims )

57:31.073 --> 57:32.245
(bells jangling)

59:03.832 --> 59:05.800
We will dedicate

59:05.959 --> 59:08.178
this human sacrifice

in memory of Rodrigo!

59:34.696 --> 59:35.913
(men chuckling)

59:48.794 --> 59:53.391
There's no real reason for you
to share the same fate as your friend.

59:53.548 --> 59:57.098
- Just tell me where the treasure is.
- ( spits )

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:07.104
Bring me swords!

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:13.619
If you won't tell me, then take
your secret to the grave with you.

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:22.168
Take up the sword

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:24.671
or take up me.

Well, come on!

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:46.777
I'm begging to be killed!

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:51.566
( Groans)

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:55.110
Well, it looks like
I drew first blood.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:06.747

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:15.090
It's a shame to waste
a beautiful woman like you.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:35.340
Oh, I'm glad I didn't shoot
you two bastards.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:39.006
- It would've been too quick.
- ( wry chuckle)

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:41.641
Hold your head up high!

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.973
You're the guest of honor

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:46.263
at our feast tonight!

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.229
( Chuckles)

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:52.315
You see, partner,

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.900
the flames are very low,
so it's up to you

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:58.363
whether you'll be rare,
medium, or well done.

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.827
Sombra: When you decide
to tell us where the treasure is,

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.664
we'll be waiting.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.169
Let's go.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:06.802
Would you like me to help you?

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:08.641
Well, I will.

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:12.603
But you...
you must help me.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:15.736
Anything.
Anything you want.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:17.896
- I want the treasure.
- I've got the treasure.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:21.567
Where is it? Where is it?

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:24.236
I got it.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:26.780
I'll take you to it.

01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:33.086
All right. All right.

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.747
But if you're lying,

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:39.339
well, this...
this will seem like child's play

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:41.674
to what I'll do to you.

01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:44.259

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:46.158
No.

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:48.911
If he comes here, my friend,

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.164
you'd better keep your doors
closed to him,

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:54.792
or we'll burn this village
and everything in it to the ground!

01:05:58.163 --> 01:05:59.756
(whooping )

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.839
Is Diego afraid
of this pretty little necklace

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:08.882
like everybody else around here?

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:11.597
All of Spain is afraid of that.

- Good. Now, turn around!

the treasure was here.

- Now, don't turn around.

a message to Diego for me.

No, please. No, don't make me do it.
I won't do it!

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.722
But you're worse than trash.

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:57.486
You're garbage.

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:02.488

Garbage, buddy.

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:51.289
Tie her to the wagon.

I think I'm gonna give you till sunrise

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:56.628

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:59.461
(voice echoing)

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:01.842
You've lost your mind!

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:05.296
This is my country!

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:09.342

It-It's a hidden cave!

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:38.913
Oh, my God!

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:41.173
It's Rodrigo's treasure!

Sombra:
Shh!

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.006
It's been right here
under our noses all the time.

01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:46.842
Of course. Of course!

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:49.598
Here, in Rodrigo's ancient fortress.

01:22:49.756 --> 01:22:53.260
Wait! Listen to me!

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:56.681
This is madness,
trying to kill each other.

01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:59.270
There's a fortune here!

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:03.028

Ha!
( cackling )

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:40.065
When the butterfly goes
too nearthe flames...

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:42.647
Alfonso: Sombra, he's not in here.
Why did you lock the door?

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:17.450
( groans)

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:26.547
Now, that's one hell of a way
to treat a princess, ain't it'?

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:31.964
You okay?

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:37.758
Wait for me inside, all right?

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:56.451
My leg.

01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:57.953
My leg!

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:03.416
Oh, please, let me go.

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:07.375
I couldn't sleep nights
if I let you go.

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:11.462
Only... give me a chance.

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:15.220
Just... give me a chance.

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.303
I'll give you a chance.

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:22.269
Just like you gave
that little gypsy girl.

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:24.600
(whimpering gasps)

01:26:24.763 --> 01:26:26.982
Get up. Get up!

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.440
How dare you talk
to me like that?

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:34.064
You think I'm just another
pitiful hunchback

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.108
limping my way through life!

01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:40.404
No, no. Don't be fooled
by my appearance.

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:42.823
I am Richard!

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:45.833
Richard, king of all of England!

01:26:45.992 --> 01:26:49.997
- Okay, Richard!
- ( groaning )

01:26:50.163 --> 01:26:52.257
If you're a king,

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:55.420
you'll understand this real good.

01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:58.589
I challenge you to a duel.

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:02.430
You got your cannon,

01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:04.310
I got mine.

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:06.517
- Huh?
- Now, you go for it.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.149
I said, go for it!

01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:25.161
Now is the winter of our discontent,

01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:29.123
made glorious summer
by this son of York.

01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:31.380
And all the clouds
that lowered upon this house

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:35.133
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried!
(cackles)

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:38.717
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths,

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:42.053
our bruised arms
hung up for monuments,

01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:44.809
our stern alarums
changed to merry meetings,

01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:47.812
our dreadful marches
to delightful measures.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:49.814

(exclaims)

01:27:57.314 --> 01:28:00.488
( cackling )
Deformed,

01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:05.156
unfinished...
(exclaims)

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:09.247
...sent before my time
into this breathing world,

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:12.834
scarce half made up,
and that so lamely and unfashionable

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:16.546
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them!

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:19.006
(shouts)

01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:22.264
A horse! A horse!

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:27.519
( groaning )

01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:35.519
A horse...

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:36.732
( groans)

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:43.406
( spurs jangling )

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:49.704
The king is dead.

01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:54.625
Long live the king.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:58.716
Or whatever they say.

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:03.054
(explosion )

01:29:58.268 --> 01:30:01.397
