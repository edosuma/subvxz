00:31.381 --> 00:32.884
Where is your brother?

00:32.917 --> 00:35.019
Ou est votre frere?

00:35.052 --> 00:38.455
Ou est votre frere?

00:38.488 --> 00:40.958
Ou est votre frere?

00:40.992 --> 00:43.094
Where is your sister?

00:43.127 --> 00:45.763
Ou uest votre soeur?

00:45.797 --> 00:49.599
Ou est votre soeur?

00:49.633 --> 00:52.502
Where is your father?

00:52.536 --> 00:55.672
Ou est votre pere?

00:55.705 --> 00:57.108
Hello?

00:57.141 --> 00:58.075
You guys?

01:00.744 --> 01:01.711
Anybody here?

01:01.745 --> 01:02.679
Hello?

01:10.087 --> 01:11.122
Yo, what up?

01:11.155 --> 01:12.389
You've reached Tolbert!

01:12.422 --> 01:13.423
Hi!

01:13.456 --> 01:14.558
Go on and leave that message.

01:14.591 --> 01:15.625
You know what to do.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.394
Boop!

01:17.427 --> 01:18.129
Hey, Tolbert.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.729
Uh, It's Scott.

01:19.764 --> 01:22.399
Um, why did I come into
work today for nothing?

01:22.432 --> 01:24.769
You told me that we were
working a private party?

01:24.802 --> 01:26.804
Yeah, we are.

01:26.838 --> 01:27.704
Surprise!

01:29.140 --> 01:30.373
Hey!

01:30.407 --> 01:32.676
Bon voyage, buddy!

01:32.709 --> 01:33.845
Oh, thanks, man.

01:33.878 --> 01:35.545
I don't leave for a week.

01:35.579 --> 01:36.981
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.083
But tonight's the only night
the restaurant's closed.

01:39.116 --> 01:40.852
Scotty!

01:40.885 --> 01:42.686
My main man, we are going to
miss you around here, brother.

01:42.719 --> 01:45.022
The place will not be
the same without you.

01:45.056 --> 01:46.389
Wow, thank you.

01:46.423 --> 01:47.457
That's... that's very
nice of you to...

01:47.490 --> 01:48.525
- It'll be a lot better!
- Oh!

01:48.558 --> 01:49.726
There it is.

01:49.760 --> 01:50.627
Aw, kidding.

01:50.660 --> 01:52.029
Kind of.

01:52.063 --> 01:53.396
But seriously, bro, I hope
that you make a better

01:53.430 --> 01:54.832
writer than you do a waiter.

01:54.866 --> 01:56.633
All right, Tolbert,
this place better

01:56.666 --> 01:58.568
be clean by opening tomorrow, or
you're doing doubles all week.

01:58.602 --> 01:59.971
Yep, yep.
Gotcha.

02:00.004 --> 02:01.005
All right.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.472
Uh, who are all these people?

02:02.505 --> 02:04.075
Oh, uh, these are
your friends, man.

02:04.108 --> 02:06.710
Happy birthday, Mike!

02:06.743 --> 02:08.478
Scott.

02:08.511 --> 02:09.713
Yeah.

02:09.746 --> 02:10.914
Look, you don't have
a lot of friends,

02:10.948 --> 02:12.549
so I had to improvise
a little bit.

02:12.582 --> 02:13.650
You know?

02:13.683 --> 02:14.785
All right.

02:14.819 --> 02:16.620
I invited some of
my improv class.

02:16.653 --> 02:17.889
She might know you.

02:17.922 --> 02:18.856
But let's just get a drink.

02:18.890 --> 02:20.157
OK.

02:20.191 --> 02:21.092
Oh, yeah.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.127
There we go!

02:23.160 --> 02:24.929
Ah, wait.

02:24.962 --> 02:28.766
To my best friend, who, uh, I
don't really understand why he

02:28.799 --> 02:30.835
has to move to become
a writer, but I guess

02:30.868 --> 02:32.036
it worked for Hemingway.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.637
So bottoms up.

02:33.670 --> 02:34.939
Actually, can we not
talk to Hemingway, though?

02:34.972 --> 02:38.742
Because he ended up
blowing his brains out.

02:38.776 --> 02:40.177
I'mma Google that.

02:40.211 --> 02:41.711
All right.

02:41.745 --> 02:42.980
Look, look, here's to a
better ending than that.

02:43.014 --> 02:43.948
- OK.
- OK?

02:43.981 --> 02:44.916
Thank you.

02:47.651 --> 02:48.518
Ooh!

02:48.551 --> 02:49.519
Come on, one more.

02:49.552 --> 02:51.155
Ooh, ooh.

02:51.188 --> 02:52.123
Hold up.

02:55.927 --> 02:56.794
Hey, Dad.

02:56.827 --> 02:58.095
Can I call you back?

02:58.129 --> 02:59.830
I'm actually... I'm at
a going away party.

02:59.864 --> 03:02.465
Scott, it's Cookie.

03:02.499 --> 03:04.902
I'm using your father's phone.

03:04.936 --> 03:09.106
I'm afraid your
father passed away.

03:09.140 --> 03:10.573
What?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.709
He died in his sleep.

03:12.742 --> 03:14.477
I called the crematorium.

03:14.511 --> 03:16.147
They're... they're coming in
two hours if you'd like to see

03:16.180 --> 03:19.817
him before they take him away.

03:19.850 --> 03:21.584
Daddy's dead?

03:21.618 --> 03:22.954
And
Scott, can... can you

03:22.987 --> 03:24.121
pick up your sister on the way?

03:41.839 --> 03:43.274
Hi.
Is he still here?

03:43.307 --> 03:44.809
Am I too late?

03:44.842 --> 03:46.143
No, he's still in bed,
right where I found him.

03:46.177 --> 03:48.745
OK.

03:48.779 --> 03:49.947
Where's Cindy?

03:49.981 --> 03:52.216
Uh, she stayed in the car.

04:46.804 --> 04:48.072
Drink warm water.

04:48.105 --> 04:49.840
Let cookie massage her legs.

04:49.874 --> 04:50.908
Avoid ice cubes.

04:50.941 --> 04:51.842
Really?

04:51.876 --> 04:53.144
They hurt his teeth.

04:53.177 --> 04:54.311
His teeth?

04:54.345 --> 04:55.678
The man's blood was
50% cholesterol.

04:55.712 --> 04:56.881
He's worried about his teeth?

04:56.914 --> 04:58.282
You know your
father and medicine.

04:58.315 --> 05:00.117
He thought if he saw a
doctor, they'd just find

05:00.151 --> 05:01.318
more things wrong with him.

05:01.352 --> 05:03.087
Yeah, isn't that
kind of the point?

05:03.120 --> 05:06.023
Uh, your father loved
that picture of her.

05:11.362 --> 05:13.730
Well, uh, I hope you
don't mind, but I

05:13.764 --> 05:18.035
collected a few personal items
that I thought you should have.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.870
So this is it, huh?

05:19.904 --> 05:21.839
A man's life reduced to
a 10 by 12 cardboard box.

05:21.872 --> 05:23.140
Oh, no.
That's not it.

05:23.174 --> 05:24.208
Wait a minute.

05:26.944 --> 05:28.846
I also made you a
tuna fish sandwich.

05:46.130 --> 05:49.400
Can you just take this?

05:49.433 --> 05:50.633
Thank you.

06:00.945 --> 06:03.347
Are you OK?

06:03.380 --> 06:04.315
Mom made me a sandwich.

06:07.318 --> 06:08.752
Yeah.

06:08.786 --> 06:11.288
Yeah, me, too.

06:11.322 --> 06:12.923
She's big on the sandwiches.

06:12.957 --> 06:14.358
Although Cookie's not
your mom, you know.

06:14.391 --> 06:16.160
She's... she's Dad's wife.

06:16.193 --> 06:20.663
Or she's Dad's
widow now, I guess.

06:20.697 --> 06:21.799
But you have a mom, right?

06:21.832 --> 06:22.900
So just don't ever
forget that, OK?

06:22.933 --> 06:23.834
You're right.

06:23.868 --> 06:25.735
I'm sorry.

06:25.769 --> 06:27.737
I mean, after everything
that Mom did for you,

06:27.771 --> 06:29.340
can you just please not
call Cookie Mom ever again?

06:29.373 --> 06:30.808
All right!
I said I'm sorry!

06:51.962 --> 06:54.231
We need to make a memorial card.

06:54.265 --> 06:55.432
What?

06:55.466 --> 06:56.800
A memorial card...
you can write it,

06:56.834 --> 06:59.236
and I can draw a picture.

06:59.270 --> 07:00.237
A memorial card?

07:00.271 --> 07:01.205
Who are we going to send...

07:07.811 --> 07:09.880
Yes, OK.

07:09.914 --> 07:11.348
That's a good idea.
Let's make a memorial card.

07:11.382 --> 07:13.184
Yeah, you can write it,
and I can draw a picture.

07:13.217 --> 07:14.151
OK, sure.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.060
My neighbor
watches TV so loud all night.

07:23.093 --> 07:25.229
I have to wear earplugs.

07:25.262 --> 07:28.132
And when I complain,
she screams at me.

07:28.165 --> 07:31.468
And she drinks a lot.

07:31.502 --> 07:34.338
I'm
sorry to hear it.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.006
What do you think I should do?

07:36.040 --> 07:39.076
I don't know, get
bigger earplugs?

07:39.109 --> 07:39.977
No, you're right.

07:40.010 --> 07:42.745
I should just ignore it.

07:42.780 --> 07:44.515
Do you want my sandwich?

07:44.548 --> 07:46.517
I don't like tuna fish.

07:46.550 --> 07:47.484
Me, neither.

07:52.089 --> 07:54.458
I hope Cookie doesn't put
Dad's ashes in one of these.

08:05.836 --> 08:07.137
I really just...

08:07.171 --> 08:08.839
I can't believe that Dad
wanted to be cremated.

08:08.872 --> 08:10.207
Why not?

08:10.241 --> 08:14.345
He never struck me as
a cremation type of guy.

08:14.378 --> 08:16.847
What would you do instead?

08:16.880 --> 08:21.285
I would have a burial like
a normal person in a box

08:21.318 --> 08:23.487
with a funeral in the ground.

08:24.989 --> 08:29.426
I'm sorry if that's
old school for you.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.228
OK, I get it.

08:31.262 --> 08:32.830
That's so boring!

08:32.863 --> 08:36.467
OK, what would you like
to do when you die, then?

08:36.500 --> 08:38.135
I don't know.

08:38.168 --> 08:42.573
I read about this thing where
they can take your ashes

08:42.606 --> 08:45.142
and turn them into a diamond.

08:45.175 --> 08:47.311
A diamond?

08:47.344 --> 08:49.546
A diamond.

08:49.580 --> 08:52.983
So you'd like to be
turned into a diamond?

08:53.017 --> 08:55.552
It beats being stuck in
a box for all eternity.

08:55.586 --> 08:57.454
OK, so... well, then what
happens to the diamond, then?

08:57.488 --> 08:58.389
Who gets that?

08:58.422 --> 08:59.823
I don't know.

08:59.857 --> 09:02.192
If I give it to you,
would you pawn me?

09:02.226 --> 09:03.127
The joke's on you...

09:03.160 --> 09:04.028
I won't even be here.

09:04.061 --> 09:04.995
I'll be in Paris.

09:07.598 --> 09:08.532
Right.

09:13.537 --> 09:15.039
I mean, I'm going
to come and visit you.

09:15.072 --> 09:15.839
Yeah.
Whatever!

12:27.264 --> 12:28.665
Thank you

12:28.699 --> 12:31.235
for calling the National
Passport Information Center.

12:31.268 --> 12:34.371
All our operators are currently
assisting other customers.

12:34.404 --> 12:36.173
Please stay on the line.

12:36.206 --> 12:38.810
Thank you for calling the
National Passport Information...

12:41.678 --> 12:42.746
Hello?

12:42.780 --> 12:44.448
Hello?
Hello?

12:44.481 --> 12:46.083
Thank you

12:46.116 --> 12:47.484
for calling the National
Passport Information Center.

12:47.518 --> 12:51.288
All our operators
are currently...

12:51.321 --> 12:52.289
Jesus, Cookie!

12:56.426 --> 12:57.294
Hey.

12:57.327 --> 12:58.228
Hi.

12:58.262 --> 12:59.329
I'm so sorry I'm late.

12:59.363 --> 13:00.264
Okie doke.

13:00.297 --> 13:01.431
So I made you a file.

13:01.465 --> 13:03.333
It's got pink slip,
repair history...

13:03.367 --> 13:04.535
pretty much everything.

13:04.568 --> 13:05.636
Do you have the check?

13:05.669 --> 13:06.570
Oh!

13:06.603 --> 13:08.138
Right.

13:08.171 --> 13:09.172
The car, dude.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.741
Mm-hmm.

13:10.775 --> 13:12.309
I actually called you, but
I think your voicemail's full

13:12.342 --> 13:13.677
- or something.
- OK.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.812
Well, no need to call.

13:14.846 --> 13:15.780
I'm here now.

13:15.813 --> 13:17.247
So do you have the check?

13:17.281 --> 13:18.348
No, I... I was
trying to tell you

13:18.382 --> 13:19.416
that I'm not buying the car.

13:22.653 --> 13:23.654
Uh, what do you mean?

13:23.687 --> 13:24.588
We had a deal.

13:24.621 --> 13:26.323
Well, yeah.

13:26.356 --> 13:28.158
B- but I asked my parents for
the money to buy your car,

13:28.191 --> 13:31.763
and they said they'd rather just
give me their old car instead.

13:31.796 --> 13:32.864
Are you serious?

13:32.897 --> 13:34.331
It's kind of crazy, you know?

13:34.364 --> 13:35.499
I got to drive around
a stupid minivan.

13:35.532 --> 13:36.700
It actually sucks.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.836
Yeah, that definitely...

13:38.870 --> 13:40.304
that definitely sucks.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.441
Do you want a cone
for the trouble?

13:48.913 --> 13:51.248
Yes, I want a cone.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.531
Cookie, I'm sort
of busy right now.

14:07.564 --> 14:12.135
Is... what?

14:12.169 --> 14:14.237
She did what?

14:14.271 --> 14:15.272
I don't know why you're here.

14:15.305 --> 14:16.607
I told them to tell Cookie.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.376
Yeah, well, Cookie's
pruning fig trees.

14:19.409 --> 14:20.477
She's doing what?

14:20.510 --> 14:23.280
Hello, Cindy.

14:23.313 --> 14:24.181
And you are?

14:24.214 --> 14:26.818
He's my little brother.

14:26.851 --> 14:28.585
What happened?

14:28.619 --> 14:30.687
Well, your sister's having
a problem with a tenant here...

14:30.721 --> 14:32.389
- Margaret.
- She hit me!

14:32.422 --> 14:33.690
Hold on a minute, Cindy.

14:33.724 --> 14:35.793
I... she... I told her
to turn down her TV,

14:35.827 --> 14:36.861
and she attacked me!

14:36.894 --> 14:37.762
I told you about her.

14:37.795 --> 14:39.196
Everyone here is crazy!

14:39.229 --> 14:40.330
We're not sure how it started.

14:40.364 --> 14:42.265
She pulled out my hair!

14:42.299 --> 14:44.501
She claims that
Cindy came in her room...

14:44.534 --> 14:45.903
stole her TV...

14:45.937 --> 14:47.905
and then spit on her when
she tried to stop her.

14:47.939 --> 14:49.473
- You spit at her?
- She's a liar.

14:49.506 --> 14:51.208
That was my TV.

14:51.241 --> 14:52.743
Trouble's been brewing between
them for quite some time.

14:52.777 --> 14:54.177
You know what?

14:54.211 --> 14:55.712
She's just jealous,
because she wants

14:55.746 --> 14:58.181
to steal my boyfriend,
DeMarco, and he won't

14:58.215 --> 14:59.216
have anything to do with her.

14:59.249 --> 15:00.617
OK, OK.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.486
So, um, you have to
separate them or something?

15:02.519 --> 15:04.856
Normally, yes, but this
isn't the first infraction

15:04.889 --> 15:06.891
Cindy's had here, and we have
a very strict three strikes

15:06.924 --> 15:08.291
policy.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.795
OK, so, um, what
strike is she on?

15:14.231 --> 15:14.932
Really, Cindy?

15:14.966 --> 15:16.700
It's not my fault!

15:16.733 --> 15:18.770
I managed to secure
a room at a board

15:18.803 --> 15:20.905
and care over in
Hammond, but they can't

15:20.938 --> 15:22.205
take your sister for two weeks.

15:22.239 --> 15:23.240
Hammond.

15:23.273 --> 15:23.941
I don't want to go to Hammond.

15:23.975 --> 15:25.509
I grew up in Hammond.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.744
Well, then you'll
feel right at home.

15:27.779 --> 15:31.849
You can come back later and pick
up the rest of Cindy's things.

15:31.883 --> 15:33.450
I... sorry, what
do you mean later?

15:33.483 --> 15:34.919
I thought that she wasn't
moving for two weeks?

15:34.952 --> 15:36.386
Not into
the board and care,

15:36.420 --> 15:37.721
but she needs to leave
here immediately.

15:37.755 --> 15:39.389
Oh, it's fine.
I'll just move in with DeMarco.

15:39.423 --> 15:40.892
He's been wanting us to
live together for a while

15:40.925 --> 15:41.859
now, anyway.

15:44.494 --> 15:46.363
We've made a list of
all her medications.

15:46.396 --> 15:49.000
I hope I don't have to remind
you about how important it

15:49.033 --> 15:50.902
is that she stays on them.

15:52.436 --> 15:53.603
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

15:53.637 --> 15:55.238
Me?

15:55.272 --> 15:56.473
Uh, she... she's not... she's
not moving in with me.

15:56.506 --> 15:57.507
No, him... I'm not
moving in with him.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.575
Well, she's not staying here.

15:58.608 --> 16:00.845
She's already been dismissed.

16:00.878 --> 16:03.647
OK, well, undismiss her.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.582
You know, I face a lot of
hard choices at this facility,

16:05.615 --> 16:07.250
Mr. Weaver.

16:07.284 --> 16:10.520
But the only choice I have
right now for your sister

16:10.554 --> 16:14.826
is to give her to you or to
put her out on the street.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.001
Can I see how much I weigh?

16:24.035 --> 16:25.903
Let's go.

16:25.937 --> 16:26.871
That wasn't my fault!

16:26.904 --> 16:27.839
I didn't say that it was.

16:27.872 --> 16:28.773
I'm going to sue them.

16:28.806 --> 16:30.007
Those people are evil!

16:30.041 --> 16:31.475
- You can't sue them.
- Why not?

16:31.508 --> 16:32.509
Because you can't!

16:32.542 --> 16:33.577
Well, just take me to a hotel.

16:33.610 --> 16:34.745
I'll go to a hotel.

16:34.779 --> 16:35.679
Oh, and who's going
to pay for that?

16:35.712 --> 16:36.713
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah!

16:36.747 --> 16:37.681
DeMarco makes a ton of money.

16:37.714 --> 16:39.817
Way more than you do, I bet!

16:39.851 --> 16:41.953
Yeah, well, most people do.

16:54.899 --> 16:56.600
It's a little bit tight,
so just be careful with...

16:57.534 --> 16:58.502
...the door.

17:08.112 --> 17:09.613
This is it.

17:09.646 --> 17:11.848
Um, the bathroom is back
there if you need it.

17:11.883 --> 17:13.415
But please, if you're
going to use a towel,

17:13.450 --> 17:14.718
just pick one and reuse it, OK?

17:14.752 --> 17:16.653
Don't start using all of them.

17:16.685 --> 17:18.055
Also, don't put your
stuff everywhere,

17:18.089 --> 17:19.422
because I'm actually...

17:19.455 --> 17:20.523
I'm trying to pack.

17:20.557 --> 17:21.959
So.

17:21.992 --> 17:23.560
That's... that's my
bedroom, actually,

17:23.593 --> 17:25.963
so if you could just, um...

17:25.997 --> 17:26.897
just don't go in it.

17:30.802 --> 17:32.435
Where's my room?

17:32.469 --> 17:34.404
Um, right here.

17:34.437 --> 17:35.605
I have some sheets
and stuff for you,

17:35.639 --> 17:36.874
I think somewhere
in these boxes.

17:36.908 --> 17:38.843
Uh, no.

17:38.876 --> 17:39.777
No?

17:39.811 --> 17:40.778
No.

17:40.812 --> 17:42.113
I need privacy for my yoga.

17:42.146 --> 17:43.680
I have special
breathing exercises,

17:43.713 --> 17:44.882
and I need space to do that.

17:44.916 --> 17:46.818
And I, I, I, I can't
do that in here.

17:50.154 --> 17:51.688
OK.

17:51.721 --> 17:52.857
Can we call Mom?

17:52.890 --> 17:53.758
I want to call Mom.

17:53.791 --> 17:54.691
Mom?

17:54.724 --> 17:55.993
Yeah.

17:56.027 --> 17:58.029
Mom can't really do
anything about it, OK?

17:58.062 --> 17:59.529
She can't do anything anymore.

18:04.701 --> 18:08.471
No, this isn't going to work.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.107
This really isn't going to work.

18:10.141 --> 18:11.508
I don't like
it anymore than you do,

18:11.541 --> 18:12.076
but we don't have
a choice, either.

18:42.173 --> 18:48.112
Hey, um, listen, uh, y-y-
you don't need me to fill

18:48.145 --> 18:49.847
any prescriptions or
anything for you, do you?

18:49.881 --> 18:51.015
'Cause I can go down
to the pharmacy.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.083
How dare you ask me that?

18:52.116 --> 18:53.117
What?

18:53.150 --> 18:54.051
That is none of your business!

18:54.085 --> 18:55.186
I'm sorry.

18:55.219 --> 18:56.419
I can't stay here.
No, no, no!

18:56.453 --> 18:57.621
- I...
- OK.

18:57.654 --> 18:58.789
- I'm not staying here.
- OK, all right!

18:58.823 --> 18:59.924
- No, no, no, no, no!
- All right!

18:59.957 --> 19:00.992
- No, no, no, no!
- OK, OK, OK.

19:01.025 --> 19:01.759
How about this?
How about this?

19:01.792 --> 19:02.626
Take my room.

19:02.659 --> 19:03.693
OK?

19:03.727 --> 19:04.762
Have my room.

19:04.795 --> 19:05.930
How about that?

19:05.963 --> 19:07.999
I'll stay out here,
and you'll have

19:08.032 --> 19:10.768
all the room you need for...

19:10.801 --> 19:11.735
to do... for yoga.

19:11.769 --> 19:12.702
So.

19:15.907 --> 19:16.841
OK.

20:04.155 --> 20:05.555
Yes, hi, hello.

20:05.588 --> 20:06.723
Uh, I'm moving to
Paris in five days,

20:06.757 --> 20:07.892
and my passport
still has not come.

20:07.925 --> 20:09.026
It was supposed
to be here by now.

20:11.929 --> 20:13.530
Um, hey, yeah, I'm sorry.

20:13.563 --> 20:14.932
My sister actually did that.

20:14.966 --> 20:17.500
You can just... you can
knock a few bucks off, OK?

20:17.534 --> 20:18.668
Yes, uh, I understand that.

20:18.702 --> 20:20.004
But it... but it
has not come yet.

20:20.037 --> 20:21.538
So what am I supposed to
do if it doesn't show?

20:25.076 --> 20:26.077
An expeditor?

20:26.110 --> 20:27.510
OK, how much would that cost me?

20:30.214 --> 20:31.715
Oh, $600?

20:31.748 --> 20:33.750
Are you... um, sorry,
hold on one second.

20:33.784 --> 20:34.651
Hey, man!

20:34.684 --> 20:35.886
Hey.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.189
You said it was clean.

20:38.222 --> 20:39.522
That?

20:39.556 --> 20:40.590
That's g... that'll
buff out easy.

20:40.623 --> 20:41.591
You know what?

20:41.624 --> 20:42.827
You can take 200 bucks off.

20:42.860 --> 20:44.795
Or a... here, listen.

20:44.829 --> 20:45.863
3,000 even.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.530
What about that?

20:47.564 --> 20:48.698
You know, your sister
should have been more careful.

20:52.203 --> 20:54.637
Yes, I... yes, I know.

20:54.671 --> 20:55.572
I'm sorry.

20:55.605 --> 20:57.208
Hello?

20:57.241 --> 20:58.175
Hello?

21:19.330 --> 21:20.231
Shit!

21:24.201 --> 21:25.702
I can't do it, Cookie.

21:25.735 --> 21:27.038
Can you please just take her?
It's two weeks.

21:27.071 --> 21:28.039
You won't... you won't
even know she's there.

21:28.072 --> 21:29.672
I'm sorry!

21:29.706 --> 21:30.707
Scott, I've already decided
to move in with my son

21:30.740 --> 21:32.043
and his new wife.

21:32.076 --> 21:34.045
I don't think they're
quite ready for Cindy.

21:34.078 --> 21:35.346
All right.

21:35.379 --> 21:36.313
Sorry about the wait.

21:39.216 --> 21:44.155
And also, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

21:44.188 --> 21:46.057
Now, let's get to the money.

21:46.090 --> 21:49.326
As you both know, your
father and Cookie...

21:49.360 --> 21:50.995
Mm-hmm.

21:51.028 --> 21:53.630
...had a prenuptial agreement,
so she won't be a part

21:53.663 --> 21:54.697
of these estate proceedings.

21:54.731 --> 21:55.933
He made you sign a prenup?

21:55.966 --> 21:59.103
Actually, I made him sign one.

21:59.136 --> 22:00.737
Your father was not
great with money.

22:00.771 --> 22:03.307
The savings,
retirement, and holdings

22:03.340 --> 22:09.080
should just about cover my fees,
which just leaves us the house.

22:09.113 --> 22:10.647
Yes.
OK, great.

22:10.680 --> 22:11.614
How soon can we sell that?

22:11.648 --> 22:12.316
That depends.

22:12.349 --> 22:13.750
Uh, who's Cindy?

22:15.753 --> 22:16.619
Cindy.

22:16.653 --> 22:17.822
What about her?

22:17.855 --> 22:19.622
Yes, well,
uh, the estate is

22:19.656 --> 22:21.624
split evenly between you both.

22:21.658 --> 22:23.027
So if you want to
sell the house,

22:23.060 --> 22:26.864
you're going to need to
get her to sign off on it.

22:26.897 --> 22:28.999
Oh, good Lord.

22:29.033 --> 22:31.802
Uh, Cindy has
had some troubles.

22:31.836 --> 22:32.735
Some troubles?

22:32.770 --> 22:33.636
Come on.

22:33.670 --> 22:35.206
Cindy's a schizophrenic.

22:35.239 --> 22:37.408
Um, when she's off medication,
she's just as likely to sign

22:37.441 --> 22:38.641
her name here as Sheena.

22:42.679 --> 22:49.286
Well, that is a pickle.

23:50.481 --> 23:52.283
You think she'll sign?

23:52.316 --> 23:56.453
Um, I've given up guessing
what Cindy's going to do.

23:56.487 --> 23:57.821
Here.

23:57.855 --> 23:59.123
It's the keys to
your father's place.

23:59.156 --> 24:00.491
I've cleared out all
my stuff, so now it's

24:00.524 --> 24:04.328
officially all yours
and Cindy's, of course.

24:04.361 --> 24:05.262
Of course.

24:08.432 --> 24:10.801
Give your sister
a chance, Scotty.

24:10.834 --> 24:13.037
She might just surprise you.

24:15.406 --> 24:19.043
Cindy!

24:19.076 --> 24:21.744
Cindy!

24:25.516 --> 24:27.184
What are you doing?

24:27.218 --> 24:28.352
There's a fire.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.486
OK, why are you
just sitting there?

24:29.520 --> 24:30.487
Get some water!

24:30.521 --> 24:31.855
Don't yell at me!

24:49.506 --> 24:51.942
I put my scarf over the lamp,
because it was too bright.

24:51.976 --> 24:53.544
You could have burnt this
whole building down, OK?

24:53.577 --> 24:55.279
Do you understand that?

24:55.312 --> 24:56.547
Can you please tell me what
the hell you were thinking?

24:56.580 --> 24:57.848
No, because I didn't
know if it would...

25:03.153 --> 25:07.891
Were you... did you not
know if this was real?

25:13.864 --> 25:15.199
I want be the
real thing, straight

25:15.232 --> 25:16.200
from the horse's mouth.

25:16.233 --> 25:17.201
Cindy?

25:17.234 --> 25:18.969
Did you get the mail today?

25:19.003 --> 25:20.504
Oh yeah, I
had to sign for something.

25:20.537 --> 25:23.374
I put it on your dresser.

25:25.109 --> 25:31.982
over in China,
and, and, and you know what?

25:32.016 --> 25:34.485
No, no, no, no, no.

25:37.121 --> 25:39.056
Shit.

25:39.089 --> 25:40.357
OK.

25:40.391 --> 25:41.492
Yes, I just want to
make sure I understand.

25:41.525 --> 25:43.027
Sorry, one second.

25:43.060 --> 25:46.263
So when that's done, you
just ship my passport,

25:46.297 --> 25:49.066
and then I just have to
be there to sign, right?

25:51.068 --> 25:51.969
Ugh!

25:52.002 --> 25:53.304
Good.

25:53.337 --> 25:56.340
OK, please, please do
it as fast as you can.

25:56.373 --> 25:57.441
OK, thank you very much.

26:00.144 --> 26:01.345
It feels weird being here.

26:01.378 --> 26:02.846
Yes, I know.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.982
But there's a minor
problem in my apartment.

26:05.015 --> 26:06.250
Like, breathing.

26:19.630 --> 26:21.899
Are you going
to sleep in here?

26:21.932 --> 26:23.067
No.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.301
No.

26:24.335 --> 26:25.636
I'll probably just
crash at Tolbert's.

26:25.669 --> 26:27.504
But listen, I do need to t...

26:27.538 --> 26:28.439
No!

26:28.472 --> 26:30.074
What?

26:30.107 --> 26:32.076
Cookie took the one
picture that I wanted of Dad.

26:32.109 --> 26:33.477
We can... we can get it back.

26:33.510 --> 26:34.978
But just listen to me, OK?

26:35.012 --> 26:36.146
We...

26:36.180 --> 26:37.448
Can I take
something else, then?

26:37.481 --> 26:38.582
Yes.

26:38.615 --> 26:39.550
Yeah, Dad would want that.
But...

26:39.583 --> 26:40.451
Can I take towels?

26:40.484 --> 26:42.653
I need towels.

26:42.686 --> 26:43.921
Take whatever you want.

26:43.954 --> 26:44.922
What if we want
the same thing?

26:44.955 --> 26:47.024
I don't think that we will.

26:47.057 --> 26:48.258
Listen, we need to talk...

26:48.292 --> 26:49.493
OK, I'm going to
make a little pile.

26:49.526 --> 26:50.461
OK, but here's the
thing... it's just

26:50.494 --> 26:53.030
we have to sell the hou...

26:56.400 --> 26:58.235
Scott?

26:58.268 --> 26:59.336
Yes?

26:59.370 --> 27:00.437
Do
you know why dad

27:00.471 --> 27:03.140
never wanted us to be together?

27:03.173 --> 27:07.177
Well, um, Dad
didn't really like

27:07.211 --> 27:08.445
me around when he was with you.

27:08.479 --> 27:09.380
Why?

27:13.283 --> 27:18.589
Well, uh, he and Mom saw
things a little differently.

27:18.622 --> 27:22.393
And well, he thought I
always agreed with Mom.

27:22.426 --> 27:24.194
About me, you mean?

27:35.005 --> 27:37.941
Yeah, about a lot of things.

28:17.514 --> 28:19.149
Scott.

28:19.183 --> 28:20.384
Scott.

28:20.417 --> 28:22.186
- Scott!
- What happened?

28:22.219 --> 28:23.620
I have to go to my
therapist, but it takes me

28:23.654 --> 28:24.555
three buses to get there.

28:24.588 --> 28:26.190
Can you please drive me?

28:26.223 --> 28:27.491
They get really mad
at you if you're late,

28:27.524 --> 28:28.459
so I can't be late.

28:28.492 --> 28:30.527
Can you drive me or not?

28:30.561 --> 28:32.362
Can you drive me or not?

28:32.396 --> 28:33.765
Can you drive me or not!

28:33.798 --> 28:35.466
Just... can you calm down
and give me one second?

28:40.137 --> 28:41.071
Stop staring at me.

29:02.259 --> 29:03.126
Oh!

29:03.160 --> 29:04.094
About time.

29:04.127 --> 29:06.296
She wants to talk to you.

29:06.330 --> 29:07.231
What?

29:07.264 --> 29:08.165
Who?

29:12.837 --> 29:15.205
You must be Cindy's brother.

29:15.239 --> 29:17.007
Come on in, have a seat.

29:21.512 --> 29:23.247
She talks about
you all the time.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.816
She's very proud.

29:24.849 --> 29:27.084
Really?

29:27.117 --> 29:29.787
That's news to me.

29:29.821 --> 29:33.624
So you're moving
to Paris, I hear.

29:33.657 --> 29:34.826
Yes.

29:34.859 --> 29:38.228
Why, you want to buy my car?

29:38.262 --> 29:39.496
Cindy's nervous about it...

29:39.530 --> 29:41.298
about you leaving.

29:41.331 --> 29:45.202
Oh, well, it's not like things
are going to be much different.

29:45.235 --> 29:47.404
I mean, we're not exactly close.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.841
And why do you think that is?

29:49.874 --> 29:51.608
Oh, gee, how much
time do you have?

29:51.642 --> 29:54.344
Well, we could discuss
it later today if you like.

29:54.378 --> 29:55.345
Oh, no, no, no.

29:55.379 --> 29:56.346
That's... that's... I didn't...

29:56.380 --> 29:58.816
I... I was not...

29:58.850 --> 30:00.317
sorry, I don't need therapy.

30:00.350 --> 30:01.251
I'm, I'm not the one
that's hearing voices.

30:01.285 --> 30:02.386
So.

30:02.419 --> 30:03.353
You think that's
the only reason

30:03.387 --> 30:05.289
people talk to therapists?

30:05.322 --> 30:06.290
OK.

30:06.323 --> 30:07.190
Uh, thank you for the offer.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.258
But I really should go.

30:08.292 --> 30:09.560
So.

30:09.593 --> 30:10.828
That's not actually
why I asked you in here.

30:10.862 --> 30:12.229
Your sister wants to get a job.

30:14.298 --> 30:15.232
Right.

30:18.402 --> 30:19.469
Oh my God, you're serious.

30:19.503 --> 30:20.671
No, my s... my sister can't work.

30:20.704 --> 30:22.172
She thinks she can.

30:22.205 --> 30:23.307
OK, well, she also
thought that the mailman

30:23.340 --> 30:24.374
was trying to kill her.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.143
Well, I spoke to Cookie.

30:26.176 --> 30:27.411
- She agrees with me.
- Does she?

30:27.444 --> 30:28.579
And Cindy
told me your father

30:28.612 --> 30:30.314
encouraged her to get a job?

30:30.347 --> 30:33.250
Oh, well, my father thought
that she was a drug addict.

30:33.283 --> 30:34.484
OK.

30:34.518 --> 30:36.119
Why don't you think
about it this way?

30:36.153 --> 30:37.688
You really want to
move to Paris and stop

30:37.721 --> 30:39.423
worrying about your sister?

30:39.456 --> 30:41.793
Help her get a job so she can
stand on her own two feet.

30:45.329 --> 30:47.197
Are you guilt tripping me?

30:48.432 --> 30:50.267
Therapists cannot
guilt trip people.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.903
Mmm.

30:51.936 --> 30:58.241
I tell myself
not to be a fool.

30:58.275 --> 31:01.345
It comes so naturally to me.

31:01.378 --> 31:04.681
It's all I'll ever be.

31:04.715 --> 31:10.487
I tell myself to grow
up and get serious.

31:10.520 --> 31:15.525
And all I want to be is
an animal that's free.

31:22.967 --> 31:27.704
I tell myself it's
not safe in my head.

31:29.306 --> 31:31.776
And that's
where I'm going

31:31.809 --> 31:34.378
to be every day until I'm dead.

31:38.850 --> 31:39.884
- Stop it.
- What?

31:39.917 --> 31:41.151
I'm not doing anything.

31:44.655 --> 31:45.722
I don't see why
I can't just work

31:45.757 --> 31:47.224
at the restaurant with you.

31:47.257 --> 31:49.292
Ugh, that's not happening.

31:49.326 --> 31:51.395
When's your birthday again?

31:51.428 --> 31:54.731
You don't know your
own sister's birthday?

31:54.766 --> 31:56.733
What kind of brother are you?

31:56.768 --> 31:57.668
Yeah, what's my birthday?

31:57.701 --> 32:03.440
February 21, 1994.

32:03.473 --> 32:04.574
Hi!

32:04.608 --> 32:05.742
I'm so sorry to
keep you waiting.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.549
So as we were talking
about over the phone,

32:12.582 --> 32:14.718
basically the job is
just sweeping up hair

32:14.751 --> 32:17.354
and generally helping out with
whatever the hairdressers need.

32:17.387 --> 32:18.455
Sweeping?
That's very doable.

32:18.488 --> 32:19.489
You can sweep.

32:19.523 --> 32:21.458
Yeah, is it usually this busy?

32:21.491 --> 32:22.659
Would you look at that?

32:22.693 --> 32:24.261
Wow, she's already
ready to pitch in.

32:24.294 --> 32:25.495
And it sure does look like
you could use her help.

32:25.529 --> 32:26.898
What are the hours?

32:26.931 --> 32:29.399
Well, generally,
our most popular hours

32:29.433 --> 32:31.869
are in the morning, so
we'll need you here at 8:00.

32:31.903 --> 32:33.437
OK.

32:33.470 --> 32:35.572
Oh, no, I can't do
that, 'cause I have yoga.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.508
OK, well, surely you can
reschedule that, Cindy.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.277
She's very into her
health and wellness.

32:40.310 --> 32:41.645
Nn-nnn.

32:41.678 --> 32:42.512
This isn't going to
work, 'cause I have yoga.

32:42.546 --> 32:43.848
Yes, you said that.

32:43.881 --> 32:45.415
But I'm sure that you
could move your yoga...

32:45.449 --> 32:46.516
This isn't going to
work, 'cause I have yoga!

32:51.354 --> 32:52.422
So she has yoga.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.876
So what makes

33:11.909 --> 33:15.378
you want to work
in a coffee shop?

33:15.412 --> 33:16.279
Coffee!

33:16.313 --> 33:17.581
Yes, uh, coffee.

33:17.614 --> 33:19.349
Uh, I don't drink it,
of course... too strong.

33:19.382 --> 33:20.484
Blech!

33:20.517 --> 33:22.552
But, uh, um, I do
like the smell,

33:22.586 --> 33:26.057
and my girlfriend says that you
guys have excellent benefits.

33:26.090 --> 33:28.760
So, um, I don't have any
doctors, though, because...

33:28.793 --> 33:30.027
Well, that's well...
I'm so sorry.

33:30.061 --> 33:31.763
Please, excuse me.
I'm so sorry.

33:31.796 --> 33:33.497
She does have a few doctors...
just a couple of doctors.

33:33.530 --> 33:34.932
- Nothing that's... nothing crazy.
- Oh, yes, I have doctors.

33:34.966 --> 33:35.967
- I mean, I didn't...
- I'm sorry, I didn't.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.501
I mean, everybody has doctors.

33:37.534 --> 33:38.502
My dad was losing his
teeth, and I'm worried

33:38.535 --> 33:40.037
that it could happen to me.

33:40.071 --> 33:40.670
But if you chew tree roots,
it can get rid of the coffee

33:40.704 --> 33:42.006
stains.

33:42.039 --> 33:43.306
And if you have dreams
about teeth falling out,

33:43.340 --> 33:45.342
it can mean that you're dying.

33:45.375 --> 33:49.312
Um, and I had one last
week, so anyway, what

33:49.346 --> 33:50.747
would my starting salary be?

33:56.386 --> 33:57.889
Cindy, we tried our best, OK?

33:57.922 --> 33:59.056
What am I supposed
to tell my therapist?

33:59.090 --> 33:59.891
It didn't work out!
I don't know.

33:59.924 --> 34:01.458
Make something up.

34:01.491 --> 34:02.927
You want me to
lie to my therapist.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.394
Well...

34:04.427 --> 34:05.863
What kind of a monster
do you think I am?

34:05.897 --> 34:07.697
That's not at all what I mean.
I just think that it's...

34:07.731 --> 34:08.933
Whatever.
You were right.

34:08.966 --> 34:10.634
I'll never be able
to get a stupid job!

34:14.772 --> 34:16.107
OK.

34:16.139 --> 34:18.408
Dude, I didn't even
know you had a sister.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.976
OK, well, if...
if you please could

34:20.011 --> 34:22.545
just give her a busboy job,
I really would appreciate it.

34:22.579 --> 34:23.679
Ugh, I don't know, man.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.116
She looks kind of timid.

34:25.149 --> 34:26.750
OK, she's just...
she's nervous.

34:26.784 --> 34:28.451
She hasn't had a job in a while.

34:28.485 --> 34:31.054
How long?

34:31.088 --> 34:31.989
Never.

34:32.023 --> 34:32.924
Never.

34:32.956 --> 34:34.623
She's never had a job?

34:34.658 --> 34:35.960
What was she, like, in
prison or something?

34:35.993 --> 34:37.494
She can pick up dishes, Bob.
OK?

34:37.527 --> 34:38.929
It's not brain surgery.

34:38.963 --> 34:40.429
Can you please... can you
please just do this for me?

34:40.463 --> 34:41.630
I will vouch for her, OK?
I promise.

34:41.665 --> 34:42.599
You will?

34:42.632 --> 34:43.900
Well, you'll be in Europe.

34:43.935 --> 34:45.937
OK, well, then, uh,
Tolbert will, right?

34:45.969 --> 34:46.938
He'll be here.

34:46.971 --> 34:48.773
Dude, is that your sister?

34:48.806 --> 34:49.841
What is she doing here?

34:49.873 --> 34:51.408
He wants us to hire her.

34:54.110 --> 34:55.913
What?

34:55.947 --> 34:56.813
Oh.

34:56.848 --> 34:58.448
Oh, you're serious.

34:58.481 --> 34:59.516
OK.

34:59.549 --> 35:01.152
Can you excuse us for a second?

35:01.185 --> 35:04.588
Dude, you can't
leave your sister here!

35:04.621 --> 35:05.823
I'm just...

35:05.857 --> 35:07.490
I'm... she doesn't
have anything, man.

35:07.524 --> 35:09.526
OK, I'm trying to help her
a little bit before I go!

35:09.559 --> 35:11.494
You're the one who said
she could never work!

35:11.528 --> 35:13.663
Yeah, I also said that I
had the idea for "Mario Kart."

35:13.697 --> 35:14.765
You didn't believe
that, did you?

35:14.799 --> 35:16.433
I considered it!

35:16.466 --> 35:18.970
OK, look, just please
watch out for her, all right?

35:19.003 --> 35:20.704
Just give her a little
encouragement now and then,

35:20.737 --> 35:21.973
and that's it.

35:22.006 --> 35:24.108
If she runs a car
through that window...

35:24.141 --> 35:27.510
She's not going to run
a car though the window.

35:27.544 --> 35:28.846
Probably.

35:28.880 --> 35:31.182
Oh my...

35:31.215 --> 35:34.517
Yeah, she... she's good to go.

35:34.551 --> 35:36.120
She can pick up some
dishes or something.

35:36.153 --> 35:37.054
You think?

35:37.088 --> 35:39.689
Yeah!

35:39.723 --> 35:42.159
No, you... you can put... you
can put now.

35:43.828 --> 35:44.929
- OK, let's go.

35:44.962 --> 35:45.629
Whoa, whoa!
OK, OK!

35:45.662 --> 35:46.596
Calm down.

35:46.630 --> 35:47.899
It's not that big a deal.

35:47.932 --> 35:48.766
- It's just got a job.
- Not that big a deal?

35:48.799 --> 35:49.733
Are you kidding me?

35:49.767 --> 35:51.434
Scotty, it's my first job!

35:51.468 --> 35:53.637
And all because of you.

35:53.670 --> 35:54.972
Thank you.

35:55.006 --> 35:56.073
OK, I'm going to take us
out for ice cream now.

35:56.107 --> 35:56.974
Oh, are you?

35:57.008 --> 35:58.475
Yeah, I'm buying.

35:58.508 --> 35:59.743
OK, well, you don't
have any money, though.

35:59.777 --> 36:01.045
I'll pay you back!

36:01.078 --> 36:04.849
Drawing in
to learn how to draw...

36:04.882 --> 36:09.854
the color shines,
and the sun it falls,

36:09.887 --> 36:14.025
promising to have no end.

36:14.058 --> 36:17.795
The more you pull
the less it bends.

36:17.828 --> 36:19.130
Looking your way...

36:22.099 --> 36:28.139
I'm looking your
way on the highway.

36:28.172 --> 36:30.707
God, this is such a relief!

36:30.740 --> 36:32.977
I was so stressed out
during those interviews.

36:33.010 --> 36:35.478
I thought that I
would never get a job.

36:35.512 --> 36:36.680
Dad would have hated that.

36:36.713 --> 36:38.082
Well, you don't
have to worry anymore,

36:38.115 --> 36:39.216
because they're going to
take very good care of you

36:39.250 --> 36:40.717
at the restaurant.

36:40.750 --> 36:41.751
And I'm sure you'll
do a really good job.

36:41.786 --> 36:42.753
Yeah.

36:42.787 --> 36:44.155
I really, really do hope so.

36:44.188 --> 36:48.793
Things have just... they
have not been easy lately.

36:48.826 --> 36:51.695
Like, I was going
to this yoga class,

36:51.728 --> 36:52.930
and I was making
lots of friends.

36:52.964 --> 36:54.531
Mm-hmm.

36:54.564 --> 36:57.101
Um, but then I didn't
really know how to, like,

36:57.134 --> 36:59.971
tell them about my situation.

37:00.004 --> 37:01.172
Why did you have to?

37:01.205 --> 37:02.173
No, no!
I know!

37:02.206 --> 37:03.107
Right?

37:03.140 --> 37:04.041
Why did I have to?

37:04.075 --> 37:05.276
Mmm.

37:05.309 --> 37:06.978
But my therapist
said that I should.

37:07.011 --> 37:10.047
Um, that was scary, because
these were normal people,

37:10.081 --> 37:11.882
and they didn't know about me.

37:11.916 --> 37:17.755
And so, um, I told them about
the medication and about the

37:17.788 --> 37:20.057
doctors and about the illness.

37:20.091 --> 37:23.761
And, um, then everyone
stopped talking to me,

37:23.794 --> 37:25.495
so I stopped going to yoga.

37:32.003 --> 37:36.040
You know, like, you don't have
to tell people anything, right?

37:36.073 --> 37:39.877
I mean, for me, like, our
past and Mom and Dad...

37:39.910 --> 37:41.145
all that stuff...

37:41.178 --> 37:42.279
I really don't tell
people any of that.

37:42.313 --> 37:45.582
It's... it's none
of their business.

37:45.615 --> 37:46.917
You don't?

37:46.951 --> 37:49.719
No.

37:49.754 --> 37:50.888
But then how do
you make friends?

37:56.360 --> 37:57.294
Enough about me, OK?

37:59.096 --> 38:01.232
This is... we're here for you
to celebrate your first job!

38:01.265 --> 38:02.133
Yes!

38:02.166 --> 38:03.733
Thank you, Scott!

38:03.768 --> 38:04.969
Oh!

38:05.002 --> 38:07.670
Cindy,
are you kidding me?

38:07.704 --> 38:08.605
I'm sorry!

38:08.638 --> 38:09.606
It's OK, it's OK.

38:10.374 --> 38:12.009
It's OK.

38:12.043 --> 38:12.943
Cindy!

38:12.977 --> 38:14.879
Oh my God, is that you?

38:15.880 --> 38:17.081
Oh my God, is that Julia?

38:17.114 --> 38:17.982
Uh...

38:18.015 --> 38:19.316
Julia!

38:19.350 --> 38:22.853
Oh, shit, it's Julia.

38:22.887 --> 38:24.121
Oh my God, Julia!

38:24.155 --> 38:25.256
Oh my God!

38:25.289 --> 38:26.157
Hi!

38:26.190 --> 38:27.291
You look so good!

38:27.324 --> 38:28.192
What?

38:28.225 --> 38:29.126
I do?

38:29.160 --> 38:30.361
No, you look amazing!

38:30.394 --> 38:32.096
Your hair is so pretty.

38:32.129 --> 38:33.130
Oh my God!

38:33.164 --> 38:34.731
Where have you been?

38:34.765 --> 38:36.901
It's been... I haven't seen
you since high school!

38:36.934 --> 38:38.135
Yeah.

38:38.169 --> 38:39.602
And Scotty... the
last time I saw you,

38:39.636 --> 38:40.938
you weren't even shaving.

38:40.971 --> 38:42.739
Yeah, well, that's...
there's puberty for you.

38:42.773 --> 38:43.974
- It's...
- Aw!

38:44.008 --> 38:46.077
So, um, what are
you doing here?

38:46.110 --> 38:47.311
I heard that you
moved to LA, no?

38:47.344 --> 38:48.711
Oh, yeah.

38:48.745 --> 38:50.613
Um, I just keep a
little house here,

38:50.647 --> 38:51.782
you know, for tax reasons.

38:51.816 --> 38:53.017
- Egh!
- Egh!

38:53.050 --> 38:54.185
Oh my God!

38:54.218 --> 38:55.152
Cyn!

38:55.186 --> 38:56.821
What have you been up to?

38:56.854 --> 38:57.822
It's been so long!

38:57.855 --> 38:58.721
Yeah!

38:58.756 --> 38:59.757
I just got a job!

38:59.790 --> 39:00.690
Oh my God!

39:00.723 --> 39:01.759
Me, too!

39:01.792 --> 39:02.793
Yeah!

39:02.827 --> 39:04.661
Um, Cindy was the real actress.

39:04.694 --> 39:06.330
Tell me you're still acting.

39:06.363 --> 39:08.065
She was so talented.

39:08.099 --> 39:09.300
I was just her understudy.

39:09.333 --> 39:10.633
So what's the jump?

39:10.667 --> 39:12.236
Uh, I'm a busboy.

39:12.269 --> 39:14.671
In a play or a commercial?

39:14.704 --> 39:16.739
No, in a restaurant
with my brother.

39:21.779 --> 39:23.881
That's great!

39:23.914 --> 39:25.916
Huh!

39:25.950 --> 39:27.717
What is your job?

39:27.750 --> 39:30.888
Oh, yeah, I got the lead
in this new TV series.

39:30.921 --> 39:31.822
Oh!

39:31.856 --> 39:32.756
They wrote it for her.

39:32.790 --> 39:34.258
Oh!

39:34.291 --> 39:36.060
Yeah, so I'm just in
town for a couple of days

39:36.093 --> 39:37.895
before I fly back
to LA to shoot it,

39:37.928 --> 39:41.298
and then I have to go to Morocco
for one episode, I think.

39:41.332 --> 39:42.900
But ugh!
You know how it is.

39:42.933 --> 39:44.301
I'm jet-lagged just
thinking about it.

39:44.335 --> 39:46.203
Oh, that sounds so rough!

39:46.237 --> 39:47.704
Ugh!

39:47.737 --> 39:48.738
We should go, Jules.

39:48.772 --> 39:49.907
We have to get ready.

39:49.940 --> 39:51.041
Mmm!

39:51.075 --> 39:52.009
They're throwing
me this big going

39:52.042 --> 39:53.444
away party before I leave.

39:53.477 --> 39:56.013
Of course they're
using my house.

39:56.046 --> 39:57.114
Mmm, mmm.

39:57.148 --> 39:59.416
So you two have to come.

39:59.450 --> 40:00.750
- No, no, that's very nice.
- OK?

40:00.784 --> 40:02.086
You just have to!

40:02.119 --> 40:03.087
But we actually... uh,
we have something right

40:03.120 --> 40:04.687
after this that we're, um...

40:04.721 --> 40:05.856
- No, you can miss it.

40:05.890 --> 40:06.957
- You're coming.
- Prior engagement.

40:06.991 --> 40:07.424
- You're coming.
- Sorry,.

40:07.458 --> 40:08.392
Oh!

40:08.425 --> 40:10.394
Billy's going to be there.

40:10.427 --> 40:12.263
Oh, Bi... Billy's
going to be there?

40:12.296 --> 40:13.297
Yeah!

40:13.330 --> 40:14.731
Do you still keep up with him?

40:14.765 --> 40:18.135
God, you two were
the hottest couple.

40:18.169 --> 40:20.337
I don't know why you
let that one get away.

40:20.371 --> 40:21.772
You two want some ice cream?

40:21.805 --> 40:22.705
Ew!

40:22.739 --> 40:24.275
God, no!

40:24.308 --> 40:26.743
Um, I just saw you through
the window, so I had to pop in.

40:26.777 --> 40:28.812
But I can't believe
I ran into you.

40:28.846 --> 40:30.114
Ahh!

40:30.147 --> 40:32.883
And, um, congrats on,
uh, the busboy job!

40:35.319 --> 40:37.021
Let's get out of here.

40:37.054 --> 40:38.889
Wait, what about... what
about your ice cream?

40:38.923 --> 40:40.357
Don't you want another one?

40:40.391 --> 40:41.292
Ew!

40:41.325 --> 40:42.259
God, no!

40:54.138 --> 41:00.077
Sunday afternoon,
yeah, watching the rain fall.

41:04.181 --> 41:09.719
Staring out in the backyard
to find out what went wrong.

41:13.791 --> 41:16.527
When you were in the
kitchen washing dishes,

41:16.560 --> 41:23.133
trying to tell me
it's all right,

41:23.167 --> 41:27.404
and I found out that all
of these little things

41:27.438 --> 41:29.139
will break your heart.

41:32.243 --> 41:37.147
But I guess that's fine,
and that's the way it goes.

41:37.181 --> 41:38.482
I guess that's fine.

41:42.253 --> 41:48.092
And I'm always stuck and
wondering in my mind.

41:51.028 --> 41:58.302
That's how
my river runs, yeah.

42:04.608 --> 42:06.076
Oh, shit!

42:06.110 --> 42:07.311
What are
you doing in there?

42:07.344 --> 42:08.379
I'm just trying to pee!

42:08.412 --> 42:09.913
Do you mind?

42:09.947 --> 42:11.148
We have
to go to Julia's party!

42:11.181 --> 42:12.483
Ugh.

42:12.516 --> 42:14.418
Cindy, just be...

42:14.451 --> 42:15.853
Cindy?

42:15.886 --> 42:17.321
What?

42:17.354 --> 42:19.456
Just because she asked
doesn't mean we have to go, OK?

42:19.490 --> 42:22.326
She doesn't... she... she
doesn't even want you there.

42:22.359 --> 42:23.260
Yes, she does!

42:23.294 --> 42:24.194
She's my best friend!

42:24.228 --> 42:25.262
Oh, Cyn.

42:25.296 --> 42:27.031
You haven't seen
her in 10 years!

42:27.064 --> 42:28.465
And besides, we need to be at
the lawyers' in the morning,

42:28.499 --> 42:30.167
remember?

42:30.200 --> 42:31.568
We have to sign the papers
to... to sell the house, OK?

42:51.955 --> 42:57.494
What, uh... what are you wearing?

42:57.528 --> 43:00.164
I like it.

43:00.197 --> 43:01.865
I don't like what
you're wearing, either.

43:01.899 --> 43:02.633
Cindy!

43:02.666 --> 43:03.534
Look at me, please.

43:03.567 --> 43:04.468
This is a horrible idea.

43:04.501 --> 43:08.105
This is a horrible idea.

43:08.138 --> 43:09.039
Fine.

43:11.975 --> 43:14.545
If you don't want to
go, then I'll just...

43:14.578 --> 43:16.013
I'll just go with you.

43:20.117 --> 43:21.085
Just...

43:22.019 --> 43:23.554
Hey, hold on!

43:23.587 --> 43:25.155
- Is it this?
- I don't know.

43:25.189 --> 43:26.890
I don't know which one it is.
I can't see any...

43:26.924 --> 43:27.925
any numbers.

43:27.958 --> 43:29.059
Do you see numbers, honestly?

43:29.093 --> 43:30.627
I think it's that
one right there.

43:30.661 --> 43:32.296
Oh my God, this at
the end of the street?

43:32.329 --> 43:33.464
Mmm.

43:33.497 --> 43:34.631
- Jesus, this neighborhood.
- OK.

43:34.665 --> 43:35.632
- Wow.
- It must be.

43:35.666 --> 43:37.134
Look at that.

43:37.167 --> 43:38.068
That's like a house out
of a car commercial.

43:38.102 --> 43:39.336
- My God.
- Oh my God.

43:39.370 --> 43:40.437
This is going
to be interesting.

43:41.538 --> 43:43.073
Stop it!

43:43.107 --> 43:44.274
- Julia!
- Stop, stop!

43:44.308 --> 43:45.909
You're making a scene.
Please.

43:45.943 --> 43:46.610
What?
I wanted to tell her we're here.

43:46.643 --> 43:48.145
Pull in the driveway.

43:48.178 --> 43:48.912
I'm not
pulling in the driveway.

43:48.946 --> 43:49.913
It's a party!

44:08.165 --> 44:09.533
Oh my God!

44:09.566 --> 44:10.501
Wow.

44:10.534 --> 44:12.102
Oh my God!

44:12.136 --> 44:13.103
Hi!

44:13.137 --> 44:14.071
Um.

44:14.104 --> 44:15.305
Wow!

44:15.339 --> 44:18.542
I... I can't believe
you actually came.

44:18.575 --> 44:19.476
Oh my God!

44:19.510 --> 44:21.078
Why?

44:21.111 --> 44:24.281
I wouldn't miss my best
friend's going away party.

44:24.314 --> 44:25.482
Oh!

44:25.516 --> 44:28.051
OK, um, come, let
me introduce you.

44:28.085 --> 44:32.623
Everybody, this is
my dear friend Cindy

44:32.656 --> 44:34.992
and her little brother, Scotty!

44:35.025 --> 44:36.293
Eh, Scott.

44:36.326 --> 44:38.195
We all grew up
together over in Hammond.

44:38.228 --> 44:39.196
Hey!

44:39.229 --> 44:40.364
How are your parents doing?

44:40.397 --> 44:42.065
I haven't seen them in ages.

44:42.099 --> 44:46.970
Oh, yeah, uh, my dad
is dead, and my mom, um...

44:47.004 --> 44:50.541
she lost her mind.

44:50.574 --> 44:52.376
Uh, no, she didn't.

44:52.409 --> 44:54.244
She's just... she's got some
short term memory issues.

44:54.278 --> 44:55.712
No, she moved to
Florida so that she

44:55.746 --> 44:56.747
could get away from me.

44:56.781 --> 44:58.682
No, she didn't.

44:58.715 --> 45:01.652
She just... she moved away
because her husband wanted to.

45:04.688 --> 45:06.023
Do you know where
the bathroom is?

45:06.056 --> 45:08.392
Because I have to go.

45:08.425 --> 45:09.426
I do.

45:09.460 --> 45:12.563
It's, um, just up the stairs.

45:12.596 --> 45:13.530
What are you doing?

45:16.733 --> 45:18.202
Is she all right?

45:18.235 --> 45:19.636
Yeah.

45:19.670 --> 45:22.372
Uh, yeah, she's just...
she's not great at parties.

45:22.406 --> 45:24.241
So.

45:24.274 --> 45:25.609
How have you been?

45:25.642 --> 45:27.678
Uh, Cindy said
that... that you work

45:27.711 --> 45:29.313
at a restaurant or something?

45:29.346 --> 45:30.647
Oh, uh, actually, no.

45:30.681 --> 45:34.017
Um, I'm, uh... I'm moving
to Paris in a few days

45:34.051 --> 45:36.320
to start work on a novel.

45:36.353 --> 45:37.421
You're going to
go write a book?

45:37.454 --> 45:38.489
I am.

45:38.522 --> 45:39.656
That is amazing!

45:39.690 --> 45:40.591
Thanks.

45:40.624 --> 45:41.658
What's your book about?

45:41.692 --> 45:44.294
Oh, uh, well, I'm actually...

45:44.328 --> 45:46.430
OK, I'm toying with
the idea of... of using

45:46.463 --> 45:48.131
the form of an epistolary
novel to explore the...

45:48.165 --> 45:49.233
- You know what was awesome?
- Mmm?

45:49.266 --> 45:50.234
"Da Vinci Code."

45:51.502 --> 45:53.604
You should write
something like that.

45:53.637 --> 45:55.072
Yeah.

45:55.105 --> 45:56.507
E... excuse
me, just a second.

45:58.175 --> 45:59.109
She's excited.

46:06.450 --> 46:07.819
- How's it going?
- Yeah, good.

46:07.852 --> 46:08.752
Cool.

46:08.786 --> 46:11.054
Yeah.

46:11.088 --> 46:14.124
That's a cool haircut.

46:45.857 --> 46:46.723
No!

46:46.758 --> 46:48.826
I don't want to do that.

46:48.860 --> 46:50.661
I really don't want to do that.

46:53.363 --> 46:54.698
I've given you
everything that I have.

46:54.731 --> 46:55.867
I really have.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.367
Because you just
don't listen to me.

46:57.401 --> 46:58.702
But if you listen to
me a little bit more,

46:58.735 --> 47:00.637
you'd understand that
it's all going to be OK.

47:00.671 --> 47:02.639
You just have to believe.

47:42.479 --> 47:46.683
You do, uh... you do a
lot of these events for...

47:46.717 --> 47:47.785
I'm a waiter as well.

47:47.819 --> 47:49.586
So.

47:49.620 --> 47:51.555
More of a fine dining myself,
but, I mean, we're all on the...

47:52.522 --> 47:53.423
...same team.

47:53.457 --> 47:54.524
Did you see that girl?

47:54.558 --> 47:55.592
What is she on?

47:58.462 --> 47:59.931
Billy!

47:59.964 --> 48:01.498
You're not going to
believe who's here.

48:01.531 --> 48:02.466
- Who?
- Cindy.

48:02.499 --> 48:03.467
- Cindy?
- Cindy.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.368
My Cindy?

48:04.401 --> 48:05.369
Yeah!

48:06.336 --> 48:07.905
Cindy.

48:07.939 --> 48:08.940
What are you doing on the floor?

48:08.973 --> 48:10.808
You need to get up, OK?

48:10.842 --> 48:11.809
Stop, Cindy.

48:11.843 --> 48:13.310
It's... it's this new thing.

48:13.343 --> 48:14.645
Cindy, get off the
floor right now.

48:14.678 --> 48:16.213
What are you doing?
Cindy, please get off...

48:16.246 --> 48:16.914
What?

48:16.948 --> 48:18.181
It's time to go, OK?

48:18.215 --> 48:19.349
I'm busy.

48:19.383 --> 48:20.684
- OK, this is not the place.
- No!

48:20.717 --> 48:21.953
- Let's go!
- What are you doing?

48:21.986 --> 48:22.887
Trust me, you're
going to want to leave.

48:22.920 --> 48:23.620
- Let's go.
- Stop it!

48:23.654 --> 48:24.856
Please.

48:24.889 --> 48:25.790
Come on!

48:26.758 --> 48:27.658
We need to go.

48:27.691 --> 48:28.592
I don't want to go.

48:28.625 --> 48:29.526
OK, well, we need to go.

48:30.928 --> 48:31.829
Cindy!

48:34.766 --> 48:36.600
Billy!

48:36.633 --> 48:38.368
I can't believe it!

48:41.638 --> 48:42.639
Oh my God!

48:42.673 --> 48:43.808
Were you out there doing yoga?

48:43.841 --> 48:44.942
Yeah.

48:44.976 --> 48:46.743
Have you, um, read
the Kama Sutra?

48:46.778 --> 48:48.378
It's really good
for constipation.

48:52.850 --> 48:54.284
Where have you been?

48:54.317 --> 48:55.719
You've disappeared
since high school.

48:55.752 --> 48:58.422
I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know.

48:58.455 --> 49:01.625
I know, I know, I know.

49:05.495 --> 49:08.265
Um, so listen, I actually have
to pack, so we should just run.

49:08.298 --> 49:09.266
Scotty!

49:09.299 --> 49:10.267
I didn't even see you there.

49:10.300 --> 49:11.268
You've grown up.

49:11.301 --> 49:13.403
Oh, that's... I'm actually...

49:13.437 --> 49:14.839
been here for quite a while.

49:14.872 --> 49:16.339
Um, we should actually
head out, for real, though.

49:16.373 --> 49:17.507
No!
Already?

49:17.541 --> 49:18.608
Yeah, come on.
Stay, have a drink.

49:18.642 --> 49:19.676
Oh, no!

49:19.710 --> 49:20.878
I'm not allowed to drink.

49:20.912 --> 49:21.813
Why not?

49:21.846 --> 49:23.513
What, are you in rehab?

49:23.547 --> 49:27.350
Uh, well, yeah, I'm in rehab,
because I'm a drug addict.

49:27.384 --> 49:29.419
No, you're not.

49:29.453 --> 49:30.320
Uh, I'm...

49:30.353 --> 49:31.488
I'm sorry.

49:31.521 --> 49:33.390
I di... I appreciate
your honesty.

49:33.423 --> 49:34.691
I really do.

49:34.725 --> 49:38.796
I was... you know, I was
in rehab for a week.

49:38.830 --> 49:40.731
And I'm a schizophrenic,
and my name is Sheena.

49:43.700 --> 49:44.802
Um, it's not.

49:44.836 --> 49:46.403
We should... we
actually should go.

49:46.436 --> 49:48.840
So if you could... or if
you want to say bye, or...

49:51.508 --> 49:52.409
Oh.

49:52.442 --> 49:54.377
You smell so good!

49:54.411 --> 49:55.545
And your hair is so soft.

49:55.579 --> 49:58.548
And you're prettier than me.

49:58.582 --> 49:59.917
- OK, let's...
- Um...

49:59.951 --> 50:01.052
...have a hug.

50:01.085 --> 50:05.622
But you... you
are so beautiful.

50:09.026 --> 50:10.494
Thanks.

50:10.527 --> 50:14.464
You... you are, too.

50:14.498 --> 50:15.833
- Mmm.
- Scotty?

50:17.068 --> 50:18.069
- OK, well, that's...
- Oh!

50:18.102 --> 50:19.469
Oh, oh!
Oh!

50:20.537 --> 50:21.005
That's... we should
probably get out of here.

50:21.038 --> 50:21.839
Come on, let's go.

50:25.742 --> 50:28.045
Are you on your meds, Cindy?

50:28.079 --> 50:29.814
- I don't have to talk to you.
- Are you on your meds?

50:29.847 --> 50:30.848
- I don't have to talk to you.
- OK.

50:30.882 --> 50:32.349
I don't have to talk to you!

50:32.382 --> 50:33.650
God damn it, if you
are not, I swear to God.

50:33.683 --> 50:34.852
Pull over!
I want to get out of the car.

50:34.886 --> 50:35.820
We're going home.
Then you can get...

50:35.853 --> 50:36.954
Pull over!

50:36.988 --> 50:37.855
I just want to get
out of this car!

50:37.889 --> 50:38.890
Oh my God!
Jeez!

50:38.923 --> 50:40.323
- We are driving!
- Pull over!

50:40.357 --> 50:41.491
OK!
Give me one second!

50:43.127 --> 50:44.862
Cindy, where the
hell are you going?

50:44.896 --> 50:46.030
I've taken lots of buses.

50:46.063 --> 50:47.765
I don't need you.

50:47.799 --> 50:48.866
You're not my parent, and
you can't tell me what to do.

50:48.900 --> 50:50.101
I'm calling your therapist.

50:50.134 --> 50:51.668
She's my therapist,
and you can't call

50:51.701 --> 50:52.736
her if I don't want you to!

50:52.770 --> 50:53.703
You're not Dad!

50:53.737 --> 50:54.738
Yeah, I know I'm not Dad.

50:54.772 --> 50:55.639
I'm trying to be your brother.

50:55.672 --> 50:56.774
You're not my brother!

50:56.808 --> 50:58.109
- You're not my brother!
- Uh-huh.

50:58.142 --> 50:59.609
You don't care about me.
You don't call me.

50:59.643 --> 51:00.744
You don't see me.

51:00.778 --> 51:02.046
You don't... you
don't do anything!

51:02.079 --> 51:03.014
I don't do anything?
Are you kidding me?

51:03.047 --> 51:04.347
Are you kidding me?

51:04.381 --> 51:05.715
Do you know what
I've done for you?

51:05.749 --> 51:06.851
I've literally sacrificed
everything for you!

51:06.884 --> 51:07.617
When have you done
anything for me?

51:07.651 --> 51:08.820
Huh?
Tell me!

51:08.853 --> 51:09.954
When have you done
one thing for me?

51:09.987 --> 51:11.022
You have a
perfect life, Scott!

51:11.055 --> 51:12.089
- I have a perfect life?
- Yes!

51:12.123 --> 51:13.390
- I have a perfect life?
- Yeah!

51:13.423 --> 51:14.125
You got everything!

51:14.158 --> 51:16.660
You have everything!

51:16.693 --> 51:18.029
I have nothing, Cindy.
Do you understand?

51:18.062 --> 51:19.462
It's always been all about you.

51:19.496 --> 51:20.932
All about you, OK?

51:20.965 --> 51:23.400
Poor Cindy got sick and didn't
get to be a star, right?

51:23.433 --> 51:24.601
Right?

51:24.634 --> 51:26.403
Did you know that
Mom... did you know

51:26.436 --> 51:27.104
that Mom once hit me because I
forgot to take out the trash?

51:27.138 --> 51:28.906
Did you know that?

51:28.940 --> 51:30.908
You were running around crazy,
and I got in trouble because I

51:30.942 --> 51:32.609
didn't take out the trash.

51:32.642 --> 51:33.845
It's really too bad that I
didn't go crazy, too, right?

51:33.878 --> 51:34.644
Then I could've done
whatever I wanted.

51:34.678 --> 51:35.679
Yeah!

51:35.712 --> 51:36.746
What did you ever want to do?

51:36.781 --> 51:38.015
What does that even mean?

51:38.049 --> 51:39.482
All right, you want
to move to Paris so

51:39.516 --> 51:40.617
- that you can become a writer?
- Yes.

51:40.650 --> 51:41.718
Because there's
no way that you

51:41.751 --> 51:43.486
could possibly do that here!

51:43.520 --> 51:44.822
We're not... no, no, we are
not talking about me right now,

51:44.856 --> 51:45.722
Cindy.
OK?

51:45.756 --> 51:47.490
You were normal, Scott!

51:47.524 --> 51:48.793
You could have done anything!

51:48.826 --> 51:49.760
Anything!

51:49.794 --> 51:50.895
You were just too scared!

51:50.928 --> 51:51.863
Yeah!

51:51.896 --> 51:53.396
You were just too scared!

51:53.430 --> 51:55.032
You, you... you just were
my little brother who

51:55.066 --> 51:57.500
wet the bed until he was 14!

51:57.534 --> 51:58.602
That's... th... I was 11!

51:58.635 --> 51:59.536
That's bullshit!

51:59.569 --> 52:00.503
Can you... Cindy.

52:00.537 --> 52:01.438
Cindy, get back in the car.

52:01.471 --> 52:02.173
Please?

52:02.206 --> 52:03.107
I'm going home.

52:03.140 --> 52:04.075
What?

52:04.108 --> 52:05.442
Oh, you don't have a home.

52:05.475 --> 52:06.576
Yes, I do.

52:06.610 --> 52:07.444
I'm going to live
at Dad's house.

52:07.477 --> 52:08.645
The hell you are!

52:08.678 --> 52:09.679
- We're selling that house.
- Oh, no!

52:09.713 --> 52:11.015
It's my house, too, remember?

52:11.048 --> 52:11.916
- Dad said we're equal.
- Well, we're not equal.

52:11.949 --> 52:12.817
Hey!

52:12.850 --> 52:14.919
We are not equal!

52:14.952 --> 52:18.823
You know what the difference
is between you and me, Scotty?

52:18.856 --> 52:20.423
At least I know I'm screwed up.

52:23.127 --> 52:24.028
We're selling that house!

52:24.061 --> 52:25.062
Do you hear me?

52:25.096 --> 52:26.630
Do you hear me?

52:26.663 --> 52:27.697
You better be at the
lawyers' tomorrow morning

52:27.731 --> 52:28.732
to sign the goddamn papers!

52:35.039 --> 52:35.973
Shit!

53:24.255 --> 53:25.957
Did she know
what time to come?

53:41.305 --> 53:43.274
Oh, shit!

53:43.307 --> 53:45.276
Where is it?

53:45.309 --> 53:46.210
Cindy!

53:46.243 --> 53:47.979
Cindy!

53:48.012 --> 53:48.946
I know that you're in there.

53:48.980 --> 53:50.881
Open the door!

53:50.915 --> 53:52.016
God damn it, Cindy!

53:52.049 --> 53:53.717
You can't do one
thing for me, huh?

53:53.750 --> 53:55.987
Not one!

53:56.020 --> 53:56.954
I want to sell the house!

53:56.988 --> 53:58.555
Of course you don't, right?

53:58.588 --> 54:00.091
You got to be the center
of the God damn universe!

54:00.124 --> 54:02.159
It all has to be
about you, right?

54:04.061 --> 54:04.996
Cindy!

54:08.232 --> 54:09.166
Shit!

54:12.003 --> 54:13.737
Scott, what are
you doing here?

54:13.771 --> 54:15.206
When's the last time
you talked to Cindy?

54:15.239 --> 54:17.141
Is she still on meds?

54:17.174 --> 54:18.742
- Scott, what happened?
- Oh, what happened?

54:18.776 --> 54:19.977
It's the same thing
that always happens.

54:20.011 --> 54:21.112
She ruins everything in my life.

54:28.986 --> 54:32.123
Your sister didn't
ruin your life.

54:32.156 --> 54:33.057
Her illness did.

54:33.090 --> 54:34.225
Yeah, same thing.

54:34.258 --> 54:35.558
Is it?

54:35.592 --> 54:36.827
Is that all she is?

54:36.861 --> 54:38.728
Just a schizophrenic.

54:38.763 --> 54:40.865
Not a woman grieving her father?

54:40.898 --> 54:43.234
Not a sister?

54:43.267 --> 54:44.802
You think you're the
only one trying to find

54:44.835 --> 54:45.936
your place in this world?

54:45.970 --> 54:46.837
OK, don't compare
the two of us.

54:46.871 --> 54:47.670
OK?
We're not alike.

54:47.704 --> 54:50.107
No, you're not.

54:50.141 --> 54:52.043
She said she lived in
her shadow as a child.

54:56.613 --> 54:58.115
She said that?

54:58.149 --> 54:59.749
She said when you
walked to school together,

54:59.784 --> 55:03.754
everyone would run up to
her and you'd be forgotten.

55:03.788 --> 55:07.258
No, that's... no, I had...

55:07.291 --> 55:08.591
I had friends.

55:08.625 --> 55:10.294
Let me see if
this rings a bell.

55:10.327 --> 55:13.064
You always felt like you didn't
matter, because your parents

55:13.097 --> 55:15.800
were constantly fighting.

55:15.833 --> 55:18.169
And you felt the same
way when Cindy got ill.

55:21.671 --> 55:25.009
You made all the sacrifices...

55:25.042 --> 55:26.676
followed all the rules...

55:26.709 --> 55:28.645
did whatever you could to
keep everyone else happy.

55:28.678 --> 55:30.680
And no one even noticed.

55:30.713 --> 55:32.817
There are people
you can talk to.

55:32.850 --> 55:34.285
Me... support groups
for families...

55:34.318 --> 55:35.685
No, no!

55:35.718 --> 55:36.887
schizophrenic.

55:36.921 --> 55:37.822
I don't... I don't need...
I don't need a support group!

55:37.855 --> 55:39.023
OK?

55:39.056 --> 55:39.890
I don't need... I
don't need medication,

55:39.924 --> 55:40.524
and I don't need a shrink.

55:40.558 --> 55:41.358
I just... I need to leave!

55:41.392 --> 55:42.725
OK?

58:12.509 --> 58:13.911
Ew.
Watch your step.

58:13.944 --> 58:15.045
Thank you.

58:15.079 --> 58:16.480
Can someone clean
this up please?

58:16.513 --> 58:18.849
So, um, have you
seen Cindy recently?

58:18.882 --> 58:20.184
Do you have any idea
where she might be?

58:20.217 --> 58:21.118
No.

58:24.888 --> 58:28.025
Did your sister ever tell
you about the voices?

58:28.058 --> 58:29.860
Um, I...

58:29.893 --> 58:32.263
I never really asked.

58:32.296 --> 58:36.200
Well, the meds don't
get rid of the voices.

58:36.233 --> 58:38.302
They just lower the volume.

58:38.335 --> 58:40.437
The voices are always there.

58:40.471 --> 58:42.306
And they're mean,
and they're nasty.

58:42.339 --> 58:44.375
And they're waiting to take
over, because they know

58:44.408 --> 58:46.944
eventually the
person will just feel

58:46.977 --> 58:50.547
so tired of feeling weak
and vulnerable they'll want

58:50.581 --> 58:53.250
the voices to take control.

58:53.284 --> 58:56.086
That's why they go off the meds.

58:56.120 --> 58:57.788
Because the voices make
them feel powerful.

59:00.224 --> 59:02.326
Um, uh... what about
her boyfriend, DeMarco?

59:02.359 --> 59:03.961
Maybe he knows where she went?

59:03.994 --> 59:04.862
Who?

59:04.895 --> 59:06.397
DeMarco, her boyfriend.

59:06.430 --> 59:10.134
Oh, right.

59:10.167 --> 59:13.003
DeMarco's not real.

59:13.037 --> 59:13.937
What?

59:13.971 --> 59:14.872
No, no, no.

59:14.905 --> 59:17.174
She... she said that...

59:17.207 --> 59:18.475
that the two of them...

59:18.509 --> 59:20.210
Your sister's very sick.

01:00:31.382 --> 01:00:34.151
Uh, yeah, she has
to be missing 24 hours

01:00:34.184 --> 01:00:36.019
before you can file a claim.

01:00:36.053 --> 01:00:37.388
Yes, yes.

01:00:37.421 --> 01:00:40.023
I know that, but she
could be dead in 24 hours.

01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:43.293
Is she a drug addict?

01:00:43.327 --> 01:00:44.661
Would that help?

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:10.154
Look, did... did
anyone see her anywhere?

01:01:10.187 --> 01:01:11.121
Ugh.

01:01:11.155 --> 01:01:14.158
No, and it was her shift.

01:01:14.191 --> 01:01:15.726
Look, man, I...

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.095
I want to help you
out, but I don't think

01:01:18.128 --> 01:01:19.630
it's going to work with her.

01:01:23.066 --> 01:01:24.301
Hello?

01:01:24.334 --> 01:01:25.669
Scott, uh, it's Cookie.

01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:28.138
I just got a call
from Cindy, or Sheena?

01:01:28.172 --> 01:01:29.406
- As she's calling herself?
- Wait, wait.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.307
You talked to her?

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.408
Where is she?

01:01:31.442 --> 01:01:34.077
Where is she?

01:02:01.205 --> 01:02:02.406
Cindy?

01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:04.174
And there?
It's Scotty, OK?

01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:05.075
It's your brother.

01:02:05.108 --> 01:02:06.043
Can I come in?

01:02:08.813 --> 01:02:09.746
Come in, come in.

01:02:09.781 --> 01:02:10.714
All right.

01:02:10.747 --> 01:02:12.082
Sit.

01:02:12.115 --> 01:02:12.583
Sit, sit, sit,
sit, sit, sit, sit.

01:02:12.616 --> 01:02:13.584
Sit.

01:02:13.617 --> 01:02:15.319
OK, OK.

01:02:15.352 --> 01:02:18.522
I'm glad you're here.

01:02:18.555 --> 01:02:19.523
Did you see them?

01:02:19.556 --> 01:02:22.392
They're following me.

01:02:22.426 --> 01:02:23.660
Who?

01:02:23.694 --> 01:02:25.562
Nobody's... there's
nobody following you.

01:02:25.596 --> 01:02:28.031
Maria from... is
in the hallway,

01:02:28.065 --> 01:02:29.600
and she was watching me.

01:02:29.633 --> 01:02:31.435
And Margaret... that bitch from
the kitchen... they're here!

01:02:31.468 --> 01:02:32.336
No, Cindy.

01:02:32.369 --> 01:02:33.470
Nobody followed you, OK?

01:02:33.504 --> 01:02:34.438
There's nobody out there.

01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:35.472
I was just out there!

01:02:35.506 --> 01:02:38.108
Shhh!

01:02:38.141 --> 01:02:39.443
I told Cookie.

01:02:39.476 --> 01:02:40.544
She's sending money so
that she can help us.

01:02:40.577 --> 01:02:41.478
OK.

01:02:41.512 --> 01:02:42.479
OK?

01:02:42.513 --> 01:02:43.413
Hey, hey!

01:02:46.483 --> 01:02:48.051
These are dangerous!

01:02:48.085 --> 01:02:52.155
The electromagnetic waves
can disrupt your brain!

01:02:52.189 --> 01:02:53.758
I don't want anything
to hurt you, Scotty.

01:02:56.727 --> 01:02:57.762
Do you want room service?

01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:02.165
No, I don't.

01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:07.805
Yes?

01:03:07.839 --> 01:03:10.107
Yes.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.575
- Yes.
- Cindy, it's...

01:03:11.608 --> 01:03:13.076
Yes.

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:14.311
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:03:14.344 --> 01:03:16.113
Cindy.

01:03:16.146 --> 01:03:18.549
You need to get back
on medication, OK?

01:03:18.582 --> 01:03:20.818
It's time to get back
on the meds, right?

01:03:20.852 --> 01:03:21.819
OK?

01:03:21.853 --> 01:03:24.254
You can hear me?

01:03:24.288 --> 01:03:25.255
Cindy.

01:03:25.289 --> 01:03:26.623
Cindy.

01:03:26.657 --> 01:03:27.658
You know that I'm leaving
in two days, right?

01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:29.426
You know that.

01:03:29.459 --> 01:03:31.328
So you need to... you need to
let me take you to the hospital

01:03:31.361 --> 01:03:32.663
now, OK?

01:03:32.696 --> 01:03:34.398
OK?

01:03:34.431 --> 01:03:37.568
Please, Cindy, can you just
come with me for one second?

01:03:37.601 --> 01:03:38.870
Stop.
Please stop.

01:03:38.903 --> 01:03:40.237
Please... can you please... just...

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:41.638
Cindy, Cindy, Cindy, please!
Please.

01:03:41.672 --> 01:03:42.807
OK?
Please!

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.107
I'm leaving, right?
You know, right?

01:03:44.141 --> 01:03:45.709
I'm sorry.

01:03:45.742 --> 01:03:47.377
It makes me a... just a terrible
brother, but I'm leaving, OK?

01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:49.212
I'm leaving, and you need
to go to the hospital now.

01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:51.248
Please... can you just please
let me take you to the hospital?

01:03:51.281 --> 01:03:53.317
Please!

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:54.819
I don't know who he is.

01:03:54.852 --> 01:03:55.752
What?

01:03:55.787 --> 01:03:56.821
He's trying to kill me.

01:03:56.854 --> 01:03:57.721
No.

01:03:57.755 --> 01:03:59.289
Cindy.
Cindy.

01:03:59.323 --> 01:04:00.591
You know me.

01:04:00.624 --> 01:04:01.692
- I don't know who you are!
- You know you.

01:04:01.725 --> 01:04:02.827
Look at me.
Look.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:03.727
- No, no, no!
- Stop it, Cindy!

01:04:03.761 --> 01:04:04.661
He's trying to kill me!

01:04:05.863 --> 01:04:06.630
Cindy, I'm just
trying to help you!

01:04:06.663 --> 01:04:07.564
Please!
Cindy!

01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:08.465
Help me!

01:04:08.498 --> 01:04:09.767
Help me!

01:04:09.801 --> 01:04:12.302
He's trying to kill me!

01:04:12.336 --> 01:04:13.303
Cindy!

01:04:13.337 --> 01:04:14.204
Cindy, stop!

01:04:14.237 --> 01:04:15.572
I don't know who he is!

01:04:15.606 --> 01:04:16.774
- Cindy!
- I don't know who he is!

01:04:16.808 --> 01:04:17.708
Cindy!

01:04:17.741 --> 01:04:18.642
I don't want to die!

01:04:18.675 --> 01:04:20.177
I don't want to die!

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:22.379
Stop, Cindy!

01:04:22.412 --> 01:04:23.815
Stop!
Get up, please!

01:04:23.848 --> 01:04:25.515
She's my sister, OK?
And she's sick!

01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:26.750
- Call the police!
- Please!

01:04:26.784 --> 01:04:27.819
No, no, no!
You don't understand!

01:04:27.852 --> 01:04:29.186
Cindy!

01:04:29.219 --> 01:04:30.888
Cindy!

01:05:22.739 --> 01:05:23.674
Hello?

01:05:23.707 --> 01:05:24.574
Hi, Tommy.

01:05:24.608 --> 01:05:25.575
Um, it's Scott.

01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:27.577
Is my mom there?

01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:28.780
Uh, yeah.

01:05:28.813 --> 01:05:30.547
You shouldn't be calling.

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.316
It just upsets her.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.351
OK, well, did Cookie call you?

01:05:34.384 --> 01:05:35.719
Did she tell you about my dad?

01:05:35.752 --> 01:05:37.320
Yes.

01:05:37.354 --> 01:05:39.289
I told your mom, but I
don't know how much of it

01:05:39.322 --> 01:05:40.257
got through.

01:05:43.427 --> 01:05:44.962
OK, can you just put her on?

01:05:44.996 --> 01:05:47.597
Look, her
dementia only gets worse when

01:05:47.631 --> 01:05:49.366
you call and stress her out.
I don't...

01:05:49.399 --> 01:05:51.334
OK, can you just put her on
the phone, for Christ's sake?

01:05:51.368 --> 01:05:52.703
I just need to talk
to my mom, all right?

01:05:52.736 --> 01:05:56.306
It's Scotty.

01:05:56.339 --> 01:05:59.476
Sweetheart, is that you?

01:05:59.509 --> 01:06:00.912
Yes.
Hi.

01:06:00.945 --> 01:06:01.846
Uh, hi, Mom.

01:06:01.879 --> 01:06:03.246
It's Scotty.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.481
Ugh!

01:06:04.514 --> 01:06:06.550
Are you...
are you in Paris?

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:07.484
No.

01:06:07.517 --> 01:06:09.553
Um, no.

01:06:09.586 --> 01:06:11.388
Uh, not for a few
more days, Mom.

01:06:11.421 --> 01:06:12.556
Ah!

01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:14.291
How is everything?

01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:15.225
How's your sister?

01:06:17.762 --> 01:06:24.802
Um, uh, Mom,
she's off her meds.

01:06:24.836 --> 01:06:26.771
Oh.

01:06:26.804 --> 01:06:29.406
When?

01:06:29.439 --> 01:06:30.307
I don't know.

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.309
Um, I... I tried...

01:06:32.342 --> 01:06:33.577
I tried to take her
to the hospital.

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.313
But she ran.

01:06:36.346 --> 01:06:37.247
Mmm.

01:06:41.786 --> 01:06:43.020
Mom, you there?

01:06:43.054 --> 01:06:43.955
Oh!

01:06:48.358 --> 01:06:51.829
Mom, don't... don't cry, OK?

01:06:51.863 --> 01:06:53.730
Um, they're going to...
they're going to find her,

01:06:53.765 --> 01:06:55.332
because the police are
looking for her, OK?

01:06:55.365 --> 01:06:56.399
So they're... don't worry.

01:06:56.433 --> 01:06:57.534
They're going to find her.

01:06:57.567 --> 01:06:58.535
This is my fault!

01:06:58.568 --> 01:07:00.337
This is all... all my fault!

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:01.304
Nn-nnn.

01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:02.073
No, don't blame yourself.

01:07:02.106 --> 01:07:03.775
It's not your fault, OK?

01:07:03.808 --> 01:07:05.609
This is not your fault, and
they're going to find her.

01:07:05.642 --> 01:07:08.345
Scotty,
she's my daughter!

01:07:08.378 --> 01:07:14.919
She's sick, and I
can't take care of her!

01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:16.353
Um, I'm sorry.

01:07:16.386 --> 01:07:19.090
What... uh... what do
you want me to do?

01:07:19.123 --> 01:07:21.025
Just tell me... please
tell me what to do!

01:07:21.058 --> 01:07:23.593
Well,
you get on that plane!

01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:25.462
That's what you do.

01:07:25.495 --> 01:07:28.665
I'm not going to lose both
my kids to this monster!

01:07:28.698 --> 01:07:29.967
- OK?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:30.001 --> 01:07:31.401
Now,
you go to Paris.

01:07:31.434 --> 01:07:32.870
OK?

01:07:32.904 --> 01:07:33.938
You promise me you're getting
on that plane, Scotty.

01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:34.839
- Promise me!
- Yes!

01:07:34.872 --> 01:07:35.773
Yeah!

01:07:35.807 --> 01:07:37.041
I will.

01:07:37.074 --> 01:07:38.708
And
while you're at it,

01:07:38.742 --> 01:07:41.012
you tell that worthless father
of yours to go find her!

01:07:41.045 --> 01:07:44.081
That's his job, not yours.

01:07:44.115 --> 01:07:45.917
OK?
OK?

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:46.851
T- tell him!

01:07:46.884 --> 01:07:47.785
Yeah.

01:07:47.819 --> 01:07:50.420
Um, yeah, I'll tell him.

01:07:50.453 --> 01:07:51.621
OK.

01:07:51.655 --> 01:07:52.589
OK.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.726
Mom, you there?

01:08:31.962 --> 01:08:33.064
OK, Weaver.

01:08:33.096 --> 01:08:34.131
Yes, yes!

01:08:34.165 --> 01:08:35.832
Finally!

01:08:35.867 --> 01:08:37.634
All right, you were look
looking for a Cindy Weaver,

01:08:37.667 --> 01:08:38.535
right?

01:08:38.568 --> 01:08:39.937
Yes.

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:42.907
All right, so here she
is located at a Travelodge

01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:44.140
- yesterday.
- No, no, no!

01:08:44.175 --> 01:08:45.776
No, I know.
I know.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:46.911
I was at the Travelodge.

01:08:46.944 --> 01:08:47.845
That's... that's
not why I'm here.

01:08:47.879 --> 01:08:49.578
OK.

01:08:49.613 --> 01:08:50.447
So she's found, and I can
take her off the missing list.

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:51.581
Oh.
No, no, no!

01:08:51.615 --> 01:08:52.482
She's not... she's
not been found.

01:08:52.515 --> 01:08:53.515
She's not been found.

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:54.718
She is still missing.
OK?

01:08:54.751 --> 01:08:55.920
Please do not take
her off the list.

01:08:55.953 --> 01:08:57.420
OK?

01:08:57.453 --> 01:08:58.622
I am just here, because
I need to make sure

01:08:58.654 --> 01:08:59.656
that her file's in
order, because I'm

01:08:59.689 --> 01:09:01.125
leaving the country tomorrow.

01:09:01.158 --> 01:09:01.893
Now, she's... she's listed
as a special circumstance,

01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:03.660
is that correct?

01:09:03.693 --> 01:09:04.560
She... they'll... they'll know
that she's mentally ill, right?

01:09:04.594 --> 01:09:05.528
Not just a... a criminal.

01:09:05.562 --> 01:09:07.098
Uh, yep, it's listed.

01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:08.598
OK, good.

01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:09.901
And that's not just
for this county, right?

01:09:09.934 --> 01:09:10.902
They'll know if she
shows up somewhere else.

01:09:10.935 --> 01:09:12.602
- We communicate.
- OK.

01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:13.904
Um, and they'll... they'll...
they'll contact the person

01:09:13.938 --> 01:09:15.604
that I put down there...
Cookie Weaver, right?

01:09:15.639 --> 01:09:17.108
Because, see... I will...
I will not be here.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.111
Look, we deal with
mentally ill patients

01:09:20.144 --> 01:09:21.611
literally every day, sir.

01:09:21.645 --> 01:09:22.813
Yes, maybe so, but
my sister really needs

01:09:22.846 --> 01:09:24.048
to get back on medication.

01:09:24.081 --> 01:09:26.050
Well, we'll do our
best to find her,

01:09:26.082 --> 01:09:28.451
but we can't actually
make her take her meds.

01:09:28.484 --> 01:09:30.054
OK, let me just tell you
something really quick.

01:09:30.087 --> 01:09:32.555
I've been around this illness
since I was 12 years old, OK?

01:09:32.589 --> 01:09:34.959
I... I got my first pimple on
the way to a mental institution,

01:09:34.992 --> 01:09:36.626
right?

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.627
I saw my first naked boob
at a psychiatric hospital.

01:09:38.662 --> 01:09:40.697
I met my first girlfriend my
sister's rehab center, OK?

01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:41.598
That has been my life.

01:09:41.631 --> 01:09:42.934
So... so no!

01:09:42.966 --> 01:09:44.100
No, Cindy does not get a choice.

01:09:44.135 --> 01:09:45.102
You know why?

01:09:45.136 --> 01:09:47.537
Because I... I never got one!

01:09:51.908 --> 01:09:53.911
This guy gets it.

01:09:53.944 --> 01:09:55.645
Maybe she'll go home.

01:09:55.679 --> 01:09:57.514
Your father once said
whenever she was lost,

01:09:57.547 --> 01:09:59.150
she always found
her way back home.

01:09:59.183 --> 01:10:01.085
Yeah, she doesn't really
have a home anymore, so.

01:10:03.821 --> 01:10:04.989
I'm sorry.

01:10:05.022 --> 01:10:09.093
Cookie, I'm... I'm
leaving tomorrow.

01:10:09.126 --> 01:10:11.062
I have to go.

01:10:11.095 --> 01:10:12.696
I have to.

01:10:12.729 --> 01:10:15.900
If... if don't, I just don't
think that I ever will.

01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:17.868
So, um, I know you love Cindy.

01:10:17.902 --> 01:10:19.103
I do.

01:10:19.136 --> 01:10:20.537
Uh, so I'm...

01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:21.939
I'm going to pass
the baton onto you.

01:10:21.973 --> 01:10:25.042
Now, listen... here is
all the names and numbers

01:10:25.076 --> 01:10:26.676
of anyone that can help you.
I've written them down.

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:27.812
OK?

01:10:27.845 --> 01:10:29.146
There's the... the
police station.

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.781
That's where I filed the
missing persons report.

01:10:30.815 --> 01:10:32.116
There's the mobile health unit.

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:34.785
I put my mom on there,
which, I mean, I don't...

01:10:34.819 --> 01:10:37.288
obviously, I don't really
know how much help she can be.

01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:39.090
Um, now, if... if
they do find her,

01:10:39.123 --> 01:10:40.623
they can't force her
to go to the hospital,

01:10:40.657 --> 01:10:43.094
so you have to keep trying.

01:10:43.127 --> 01:10:45.562
Now, I'll be reachable
by email in Paris.

01:10:45.595 --> 01:10:47.564
But... but the only thing
you have to think about...

01:10:47.597 --> 01:10:48.933
really, the only
thing is getting

01:10:48.966 --> 01:10:50.667
her back on the medication.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.969
OK?

01:10:52.003 --> 01:10:53.104
That's the only thing
that really matters.

01:10:53.137 --> 01:10:54.171
Medication.

01:10:54.205 --> 01:10:57.008
Uh, OK.

01:10:57.041 --> 01:10:58.976
I will.

01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:01.212
OK.

01:11:01.245 --> 01:11:02.712
Th... thank you.

01:11:10.988 --> 01:11:11.956
Aw!

01:11:11.989 --> 01:11:13.924
Shit!

01:11:16.293 --> 01:11:17.194
Hey!

01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:18.129
Hey!

01:11:18.162 --> 01:11:19.063
Hey!

01:12:26.163 --> 01:12:27.131
Hi.

01:12:27.164 --> 01:12:28.631
I am so sorry to bother you.

01:12:28.665 --> 01:12:30.401
Um, my sister and I...

01:12:30.434 --> 01:12:32.069
we used to live here.

01:12:32.103 --> 01:12:34.271
Is there any chance you might
have seen a girl walking

01:12:34.305 --> 01:12:36.673
around here looking just...

01:12:36.706 --> 01:12:37.942
just sort of crazy?

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:41.172
I know you.

01:13:41.205 --> 01:13:42.473
I know who you are.

01:13:42.506 --> 01:13:43.807
You want my money.

01:13:43.841 --> 01:13:44.775
Yeah?

01:13:44.808 --> 01:13:45.809
You want to steal my car?

01:13:51.315 --> 01:13:52.183
Dad's dead.

01:13:52.216 --> 01:13:53.150
I killed him.

01:13:53.184 --> 01:13:54.251
I killed the bastard.

01:13:54.285 --> 01:13:55.252
Cindy?

01:13:55.286 --> 01:13:56.120
I killed him!

01:13:56.153 --> 01:13:58.289
I killed Dad.

01:13:58.322 --> 01:13:59.190
What are you looking at?

01:13:59.223 --> 01:14:00.723
Cindy.

01:14:00.758 --> 01:14:01.859
What are you looking
at, you stupid bitch?

01:14:01.892 --> 01:14:03.027
Cindy, please stop.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.828
Cindy, please.

01:14:04.862 --> 01:14:05.829
Please stop and look at me!

01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:06.797
Please.

01:14:10.067 --> 01:14:11.969
OK, I know you're in there.

01:14:12.002 --> 01:14:13.204
I know... I know it.

01:14:13.237 --> 01:14:14.305
I know you're in there.

01:14:14.338 --> 01:14:15.272
Please?

01:14:28.085 --> 01:14:30.487
Don't... don't do it.

01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:32.823
Don't!

01:14:32.856 --> 01:14:34.792
Cindy, stop!

01:14:35.526 --> 01:14:36.460
Cindy!

01:14:37.528 --> 01:14:38.762
God damn it!

01:14:38.796 --> 01:14:39.496
Cindy!

01:15:14.832 --> 01:15:15.766
Cindy?

01:15:21.005 --> 01:15:21.905
Cindy.

01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:31.315
I killed Mom.

01:15:34.618 --> 01:15:36.153
I killed Mom.

01:15:36.186 --> 01:15:37.221
I killed Dad.

01:15:41.992 --> 01:15:45.229
I killed Scotty.

01:15:45.262 --> 01:15:48.132
I killed Cindy.

01:15:48.165 --> 01:15:49.400
Don't listen to that voice, OK?

01:15:49.433 --> 01:15:50.334
You listen to mine.

01:15:50.367 --> 01:15:51.502
I'm a stupid fuck!

01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:53.370
Cindy, I'm right here!

01:15:53.404 --> 01:15:54.371
I'm right here.
It's me.

01:15:54.405 --> 01:15:55.406
It's Scotty, your brother.

01:15:55.439 --> 01:15:56.340
OK?

01:15:56.373 --> 01:15:57.374
I'm next to you.

01:15:57.408 --> 01:15:58.375
Listen to my voice.

01:15:58.409 --> 01:16:01.111
I'm going to take you home.

01:16:01.145 --> 01:16:05.049
I'm going to turn
into a diamond.

01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:07.818
A big, bright diamond.

01:17:19.323 --> 01:17:20.224
Hi, Scotty!

01:17:23.193 --> 01:17:24.128
Hi!

01:17:31.568 --> 01:17:33.303
We should go, OK?

01:17:33.337 --> 01:17:34.238
OK.

01:17:34.271 --> 01:17:37.641
Let's go, come on.

01:17:37.674 --> 01:17:40.544
Come on.

01:17:40.577 --> 01:17:42.012
Let's go home, all right?

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.258
Let's go.

01:18:02.166 --> 01:18:04.134
Mom's dead.

01:18:04.168 --> 01:18:06.703
Dad's dead.

01:18:06.737 --> 01:18:10.674
Well, we're still here.

01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:34.631
Don't I
look like my mother

01:18:40.237 --> 01:18:44.408
when I've passed out
on our kitchen floor

01:18:44.441 --> 01:18:47.478
from fighting drunk at the bar?

01:18:55.486 --> 01:19:05.496
Don't I look like
my mother when I'm

01:19:12.135 --> 01:19:16.473
jealous and insecure
and throwing

01:19:16.507 --> 01:19:20.577
holes through our bedroom door?

01:19:27.819 --> 01:19:35.793
I never thought I'd be
cut from the same cloth.

01:19:40.731 --> 01:19:50.741
But my eyes burn just like
hers when I'm messed up.

01:19:55.712 --> 01:20:05.722
And oh, oh, I thought I'd learn,
but ain't I my mother's girl?

01:20:24.174 --> 01:20:33.450
And oh, I never thought I'd
be cut from the same cloth.

01:20:39.389 --> 01:20:49.399
And oh, I thought
I'd learn, ooh.

01:20:56.707 --> 01:21:03.547
Ain't I my mother's girl?

01:21:23.667 --> 01:21:25.268
When you
get on an airplane,

01:21:25.302 --> 01:21:27.304
they always tell you to
put on your own oxygen mask

01:21:27.337 --> 01:21:31.174
first before helping others,
because you can't help anyone

01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:33.343
if you're drowning yourself.

01:21:33.377 --> 01:21:36.580
It was a point not lost on
him, as he waited patiently...

01:21:36.613 --> 01:21:40.317
seat upright, tray table stowed.

01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:42.920
But it was a point made
too late to matter.

01:21:42.954 --> 01:21:47.257
His struggle was all in the past
now, along with his family...

01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:49.794
buried in the shared plot
alongside his expectations

01:21:49.827 --> 01:21:50.762
of himself.

01:21:52.897 --> 01:21:53.798
So.

01:21:59.403 --> 01:22:00.337
What do you think?

01:22:03.473 --> 01:22:07.711
I think it's beautiful.

01:22:07.744 --> 01:22:12.282
Well, it's just a
start, but thank you.

01:22:12.315 --> 01:22:15.252
Am I going to be a character?

01:22:15.285 --> 01:22:19.256
Um, there's a character
based on you, sort of.

01:22:19.289 --> 01:22:21.793
I always told you I
was going to be a star.

01:22:21.826 --> 01:22:24.628
Oh my God.

01:22:24.661 --> 01:22:25.629
How are the new meds?

01:22:25.662 --> 01:22:26.697
Ugh!

01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:27.597
Terrible.

01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:28.732
I feel so bloated.

01:22:28.766 --> 01:22:29.700
Do I look fat?

01:22:29.733 --> 01:22:30.968
- No.
- I feel fat.

01:22:31.002 --> 01:22:31.903
No.

01:22:31.936 --> 01:22:33.905
You look fine.

01:22:33.938 --> 01:22:37.240
But are they helping,
though, with the voices?

01:22:41.946 --> 01:22:42.847
Yeah.

01:22:46.851 --> 01:22:49.386
Five minutes, everyone!

01:22:49.419 --> 01:22:50.955
All right.

01:22:50.988 --> 01:22:53.323
Save it for next
week, Shakespeare.

01:22:53.356 --> 01:22:54.926
I can stay a bit longer.

01:22:54.959 --> 01:22:56.894
No, you should go.

01:22:56.928 --> 01:22:57.895
It's important that you go.

01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.672
I'm sorry.

01:23:08.705 --> 01:23:12.676
I'm sorry that you didn't
get to go to Paris.

01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:15.345
Well, it's been
around for 1,000 years,

01:23:15.378 --> 01:23:19.851
so I think that it
can wait one more.

01:23:19.884 --> 01:23:22.053
I hope you get there soon.

01:23:22.086 --> 01:23:24.354
Thanks.

01:23:24.387 --> 01:23:25.522
Just don't set my
passport on fire.

01:23:25.555 --> 01:23:26.423
Oh my God!
Stop it!

01:23:26.456 --> 01:23:27.357
Ow!

01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:28.658
I'm such a jerk.

01:23:28.692 --> 01:23:29.927
Nurse,
she's attacking me!

01:23:29.961 --> 01:23:31.028
No, stop!
They really take that seriously.

01:23:31.062 --> 01:23:32.562
OK.
OK, I'm sorry.

01:23:32.596 --> 01:23:34.331
You're probably right.

01:23:34.364 --> 01:23:35.665
Oh!

01:23:35.699 --> 01:23:37.334
OK, I'm calling an Uber.

01:23:37.367 --> 01:23:38.568
OK.

01:23:38.602 --> 01:23:39.703
Hey!

01:23:39.736 --> 01:23:41.738
Do you want to get
a car together?

01:23:41.773 --> 01:23:43.007
How would that work?

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.508
You would get the
first half of the week,

01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:45.943
and I would get the
second half of the week.

01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:48.478
OK, Cindy, you know that's
not going to work, OK?

01:23:48.512 --> 01:23:49.746
This is just like
the pogo stick.

01:23:49.781 --> 01:23:52.716
There is an odd number
of days, remember?

01:23:52.749 --> 01:23:54.018
Oh, yeah.

01:23:54.051 --> 01:23:56.053
Mm-hmm.

01:23:56.087 --> 01:23:57.420
The pogo stick.

01:23:57.454 --> 01:23:58.688
The pogo stick!

01:23:58.722 --> 01:24:00.024
Oh my God, remember?

01:24:00.057 --> 01:24:03.027
Dad got so mad that he
made us throw it away.

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.494
Is that what happened to it?

01:24:04.528 --> 01:24:05.629
Yeah, he threw it away!

01:24:05.662 --> 01:24:06.530
You don't remember?

01:24:06.563 --> 01:24:07.799
I don't!

01:24:07.832 --> 01:24:10.868
Oh my God, it was
a piece of work.

01:24:10.902 --> 01:24:11.803
He really was.

01:24:19.043 --> 01:24:19.977
I wish he was here.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.381
Yeah, me, too.

01:24:45.803 --> 01:24:47.071
- Do you need any help?
- Um...

01:24:47.104 --> 01:24:48.572
- No, we're good.
- It's questionable.

01:24:48.605 --> 01:24:49.841
But it's
going to be good.

01:24:49.874 --> 01:24:51.108
- We're going to do well.
- OK.

01:24:51.142 --> 01:24:52.642
Two more,
and then I'm good.

01:24:52.676 --> 01:24:53.845
All right.
You good to go?

01:24:53.878 --> 01:24:54.744
Yes.

01:24:56.013 --> 01:24:57.414
Let's do it.

01:24:57.447 --> 01:24:58.415
Oh, wait,
I forgot the cream.

01:24:58.448 --> 01:24:59.683
Thank you guys for helping.

01:24:59.716 --> 01:25:00.684
I forgot the cream,
I forgot the cream!

01:25:00.717 --> 01:25:01.418
I'm sorry.
OK, OK, OK.

01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:03.020
Here we go.

01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:04.155
- Can't do without the cream.
- Can't do without the cream.

01:25:04.188 --> 01:25:04.922
All
right, let's go.

01:25:04.956 --> 01:25:05.689
Hey, everybody!

01:25:05.722 --> 01:25:06.590
Watch you step.

01:25:06.623 --> 01:25:07.624
I think we're all here.

01:25:07.657 --> 01:25:09.026
All right.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.627
A big thank
you to Scott for hosting

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.661
the group meeting this week.

01:25:11.695 --> 01:25:12.964
It's my deepest pleasure.

01:25:12.997 --> 01:25:13.898
Here's some coffee.

01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:14.832
Anybody need...

01:25:14.866 --> 01:25:15.800
I got it, Scotty.

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:16.767
Thank you, Cookie.

01:25:19.436 --> 01:25:20.938
Cookies from cookie.

01:25:22.173 --> 01:25:24.574
All right, who
wants to share first?

01:25:27.477 --> 01:25:29.046
Scott?

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:29.947
Yeah, OK.

01:25:29.981 --> 01:25:31.816
Uh, sure.

01:25:31.849 --> 01:25:33.150
Hello.

01:25:33.184 --> 01:25:37.621
Um, for anybody that's
new, my name's Scott,

01:25:37.654 --> 01:25:41.125
and my sister's schizophrenic.

01:25:41.158 --> 01:25:47.198
Um, sorry, my
sister is my sister,

01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:50.001
and she has schizophrenia.

01:25:50.034 --> 01:25:53.871
And that is very
difficult at times, um,

01:25:53.905 --> 01:25:57.141
as I'm sure you know.

01:25:57.174 --> 01:25:58.675
Lately, it's been quite good.

01:25:58.708 --> 01:26:00.845
She is in the hospital
at the moment, uh,

01:26:00.878 --> 01:26:02.113
getting some really good care.

01:26:02.146 --> 01:26:05.682
She's on a really
good meds regimen, um,

01:26:05.715 --> 01:26:08.920
and things are
going pretty great.

01:26:08.953 --> 01:26:11.688
I have absolutely
no idea if that

01:26:11.721 --> 01:26:13.758
will be the case next week.

01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:17.762
But, um, today is
not too shabby.

01:26:47.158 --> 01:26:50.727
It takes, uh, a lot of... of...

01:26:50.761 --> 01:26:52.997
a lot of education
to really begin

01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:54.899
to understand that we
have to differentiate

01:26:54.932 --> 01:26:56.267
the person from the illness.

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:59.804
I am living with a
schizoaffective disorder...

01:26:59.837 --> 01:27:03.074
have been for the past 16 years.

01:27:03.107 --> 01:27:05.076
It's a challenge
when a... a person you

01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:07.144
know is no longer that person.

01:27:07.178 --> 01:27:10.247
To have them be who
you though we were...

01:27:10.281 --> 01:27:12.515
and then suddenly their
face is different.

01:27:12.549 --> 01:27:13.784
They look different.

01:27:13.818 --> 01:27:15.585
They're... they're
saying things that you

01:27:15.618 --> 01:27:16.753
wouldn't expect them to say.

01:27:16.787 --> 01:27:18.588
And... and they're just...

01:27:18.621 --> 01:27:20.791
and they're... they're
just not your mom anymore.

01:27:20.825 --> 01:27:23.894
Our daughter, unfortunately,
does not accept her illness...

01:27:23.928 --> 01:27:25.662
um, is fairly reclusive.

01:27:25.695 --> 01:27:28.531
And... and it's been
interesting as a family, uh,

01:27:28.565 --> 01:27:32.903
and a journey to
accept, uh, the illness.

01:27:32.937 --> 01:27:34.738
In my brother's
situation... and this is

01:27:34.772 --> 01:27:37.908
the situation for many...
he can't manage his own,

01:27:37.942 --> 01:27:40.277
um, um, health care.

01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:42.046
That's where I step in...

01:27:42.079 --> 01:27:46.117
is to be that liaison for him
between him and the doctors

01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:48.119
and understanding...
observing what's going on,

01:27:48.152 --> 01:27:50.154
providing collateral
information,

01:27:50.187 --> 01:27:53.723
and making sure that the
medication is working.

01:27:53.758 --> 01:27:56.227
In the past 15
years, I've been on...

01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:00.730
I've tried maybe a dozen
different medications.

01:28:00.765 --> 01:28:05.702
Risperidone,
olanzapine, Seroquel,

01:28:05.735 --> 01:28:09.940
Dilantin, Celexa.

01:28:09.974 --> 01:28:12.243
You know, all these
crazy names, right?

01:28:12.276 --> 01:28:15.312
There's definitely something
called caregiver burnout.

01:28:16.847 --> 01:28:20.051
Uh, which, uh, impacted me.

01:28:20.084 --> 01:28:23.287
I ended up developing
depression myself just

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.754
from everything
going on with Mom

01:28:24.789 --> 01:28:27.324
but spilling over
into everything else.

01:28:27.358 --> 01:28:30.861
Uh, when my mom first
started becoming symptomatic,

01:28:30.895 --> 01:28:32.196
I was planning a wedding.

01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:33.764
Aw.

01:28:33.798 --> 01:28:35.900
Uh, and I wasn't
sure if she was going

01:28:35.933 --> 01:28:38.269
to be well enough to come.

01:28:38.302 --> 01:28:42.206
The... the bond as a
family is enormously strong,

01:28:42.239 --> 01:28:43.841
and it amazes me...

01:28:43.874 --> 01:28:47.644
even us going through what
we've gone through... how

01:28:47.677 --> 01:28:49.113
strong that family bond is.

01:28:49.146 --> 01:28:53.117
It doesn't go away come
hell or high water.

01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:56.954
It's important
to realize that 50%

01:28:56.987 --> 01:29:00.157
of people with
schizophrenia have a symptom

01:29:00.191 --> 01:29:02.359
called anosognosia, when...

01:29:02.393 --> 01:29:04.862
where they don't realize
that they're ill.

01:29:04.895 --> 01:29:08.165
So it often takes a third person
perspective... like a family

01:29:08.199 --> 01:29:12.369
member or a doctor or a
school counselor... someone

01:29:12.403 --> 01:29:16.407
with an objective perspective
and someone who can

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.043
make that educated assessment.

01:29:19.076 --> 01:29:21.212
Support groups... they've
become safe environments where

01:29:21.245 --> 01:29:24.681
it's... it's nice to
people who, um, have

01:29:24.714 --> 01:29:26.150
traveled a similar journey.

01:29:26.183 --> 01:29:27.418
And so they understand.

01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:28.352
Thank you so much.

01:29:28.385 --> 01:29:29.286
You're welcome.

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.788
Thank you.

01:29:30.821 --> 01:29:33.858
The brain is unknown,
uncharted territory,

01:29:33.891 --> 01:29:36.994
and of course there's
going to be stigma.

01:29:37.027 --> 01:29:40.197
Because it's natural
to fear the unknown.

01:29:40.231 --> 01:29:42.699
You guys are so generous
for taking the time.

01:29:43.968 --> 01:29:46.871
I couldn't possibly
have learned more.
