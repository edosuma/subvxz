02:20.760 --> 02:22.960

Watching...

17:14.240 --> 17:16.240
each other, slowly.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.680
Just watching.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.960
Bit by bit. Slow.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.560
Slowly.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.240
Slow. And then he started...

17:35.680 --> 17:36.800
kissing me here.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.840
And then he kissed me here.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.960
And then he kissed me on the...

17:49.720 --> 17:50.680
And then we...

17:53.880 --> 17:54.720
lay down.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.040
Then...

18:48.560 --> 18:49.520
We didn't really...

18:49.600 --> 18:51.600
-She just kept saying...
-"Mum, I want to see her."

18:51.680 --> 18:53.200
We were in the taxi and she wouldn't--

18:53.280 --> 18:54.280
It's all right.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.560
-Nathaniel announced his engagement.
-Posted a thing on...

18:56.680 --> 18:57.600
-Of the ring.
-Yeah.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.640
Sophie Kaskell.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.960
She's the one who used to have that mole
she got removed?

19:01.120 --> 19:02.000
Yeah.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.080
-Laura was...
-She was, like, distraught.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.360
-So then we were like...
-But we had no idea...

19:06.440 --> 19:09.840
I mean, we probably knew she was
maybe still full-on in love with him...

19:10.040 --> 19:12.400
-But we didn't realize...
-Otherwise we would have never...

19:12.480 --> 19:14.320
-Don't worry.
-You did the right thing.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.800
But we would've never...

19:15.880 --> 19:17.640
-Get you something to drink?
-No, thank you.

19:17.720 --> 19:18.600
Hello.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.640
Sounds like you've had
a bit of a shit one.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.680
I'm sorry, love.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.600
We haven't even been broken up that long.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.080
I know.

19:29.720 --> 19:30.960
How about some water?

19:31.440 --> 19:33.800
Just have a little sip, so we can...
Yeah, here we go.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.600
That's it. How's that?

19:39.240 --> 19:40.400
He put a little pic--

19:42.680 --> 19:43.560
Epic.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.640
-Let's-- Up we get.
-Yeah.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.920
-Here we go.
-Oh, dear.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.960
-Let's go this way...
-Yeah, round it.

19:50.040 --> 19:50.920
Watch your feet.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.280
-All right, you okay?
-Yeah.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.480
-We've got you.
-[vomits]

19:55.560 --> 19:57.560
-Only a little bit.
-So sorry.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.040
How's she doing?

20:20.880 --> 20:22.560
Nathaniel is such a prick.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.920
Yeah, he had the weirdest thumbs.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.800
I might have to call it a night.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.280
Toast.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.320
Thank you.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.200
I haven't been able to stop thinking
about last night.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.040
It really made me...

21:10.880 --> 21:12.840
It made me really want you.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.800
Yeah, I know what you mean.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
And I thought it might be weird.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.880
You know?  Coming home. But...

21:19.960 --> 21:21.240
No, it was the opposite.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.440
I couldn't wait to see you.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.120
To talk to you.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.360
Same.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.680
[weak groaning]

21:42.120 --> 21:43.000
She's alive.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.920
And then you were like,
”Oh, my God, I love him so much.”

21:49.000 --> 21:53.480
And then you puked, like, there,
and then there, and, like, all up there.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.000
Jesus.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.800
And then Mum and Dad had to practically
air lift you into the toilet...

21:57.920 --> 22:01.120
Then you refused to move. It was like,
shit, it's the funniest thing.

22:01.200 --> 22:05.840
Yeah! You were like, "This is my home,
this is where I feel safest."

22:05.920 --> 22:09.840
I'm so thrilled my genuine despair
brings you such unadulterated glee.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.120
Fuckers.

22:11.200 --> 22:15.240
And on that note,
I hope you feel better, love.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.960
-I'm so sorry, Dad.
-No, don't be silly.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.800
Go steady, right?

22:22.560 --> 22:23.440
Bye.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.600
-Bye.
-Ciao.

-Cool.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.120

Friend, food.

24:35.080 --> 24:39.360
And from your point of view,
how was that?

24:40.840 --> 24:43.320

I had a whale of a time.

Please.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.920
Right, look, we need to go over
some basic shit first.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.680
Yeah, if you go up to her now, all like...

25:14.800 --> 25:16.600
It's gonna be like
basically stalking her.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.520
-What?
-Have you sent her a friend request?

25:18.600 --> 25:21.040
No, but I don't get it,
she's just sat over there,

25:21.160 --> 25:22.920
why can't I just go over?

25:23.000 --> 25:26.600
You're like one of them monkeys they send
up into space to see how it blows up.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.160
What you gonna do if she says no?

25:28.280 --> 25:30.080
The thing is, if you send her
a friend request

25:30.160 --> 25:32.000
after she's said no
to the weird talk thing...

25:32.080 --> 25:33.480
Then it's like stalker times ten.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.480
Look, we're not saying
you shouldn't ask her to...

25:36.560 --> 25:39.440
Just maybe the best way
to get her to say yes is to be like...

25:39.600 --> 25:41.760
-Friend request.
-Message, message, message...

25:41.840 --> 25:43.160
You can just casually be like...

25:43.280 --> 25:44.120
"Hey, by the way..."

25:44.200 --> 25:45.600
"There's this talk thing happening

25:45.720 --> 25:47.560
and now we have
this whole shared history..."

25:47.640 --> 25:49.800
And without any stalker-y weirdness,
you be like...

25:49.920 --> 25:51.080
"Let's hang out."

25:51.760 --> 25:54.160
I didn't wanna have to bring this up,
but the other thing is,

25:54.240 --> 25:56.760
my brother says she's fucked like
half the guys at her old school.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.240
There is no way that can be true.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.760
Even if she had slept with
half the guys at her old school,

26:00.840 --> 26:04.360
that means she would've had
to have had sex once a day, for like...

26:04.440 --> 26:07.800
Okay, A, he wasn't necessarily
being completely literal.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.920
And, B, the numbers could totally add up.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.960
What do you think?

26:14.120 --> 26:16.120
I think you should do whatever you want.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.600
Or you could just sort of like... tell me.

26:39.680 --> 26:40.520
Hey.

26:41.720 --> 26:42.600
Hello.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.880
Do you like Zadie Smith?

26:46.600 --> 26:48.280
-Yeah,
-She's doing this talk.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.240
There's this talk that she's doing.
It's sold out.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.840
But I'm on the waiting list.

26:52.920 --> 26:56.160
And there is this option
for one or two tickets, so I chose two.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.080
So how many did you get?

27:00.920 --> 27:03.080
Yeah. No, I don't know yet. So...

27:04.200 --> 27:06.760
I-- Hopefully I'll hear, like...

27:08.040 --> 27:09.280
I mean, I can let you know

27:10.000 --> 27:13.800
once I know, in case you're...
in case you wanna... in case--

27:13.880 --> 27:14.720
Okay.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.920
So, what the fuck?  What she say?

27:33.120 --> 27:35.440
-She's head barista.
-Of the House of Commons?

27:35.520 --> 27:36.680
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow!

27:36.880 --> 27:40.920
She said it takes 42 coffee beans, right,
to make one cup of espresso.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.560
-How did the two of you meet?
-Tinder.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.640
Yeah, we'd been messaging a bit
and then...

27:46.040 --> 27:49.400
I was nearby and I said, "Hey,
I'm in the vicinity, what's up?"

27:50.320 --> 27:53.240
And she said, "I'm at work, come by,
I'll show you around."

27:53.960 --> 27:57.800
So she does, and at the end,
I was standing outside the gift shop,

27:57.880 --> 28:00.200
we are spitting distance
from the disabled toilet

28:00.280 --> 28:04.040
and she leans in, like, right in,
proper close and she whispers,

28:04.120 --> 28:06.720
"I've always wanted to fuck someone
in the disabled toilet."

28:08.880 --> 28:09.760
And you said?

28:15.280 --> 28:17.960
And is there a chance, do you think,
the two of you might...

28:18.400 --> 28:19.800
see each other again?

28:19.880 --> 28:21.720
I'm gonna say probably not.

28:21.880 --> 28:22.840
Not in a bad way.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.360
I mean, if she wants to see me again,
that'd be cool, but...

28:25.520 --> 28:27.760
You're quite relaxed about it either way?

28:29.520 --> 28:30.360
Yeah.

28:33.320 --> 28:36.840
Jason, I would like to return to something
we spoke about last week.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.480
Because, in truth, I can't really
stop thinking about it.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.960
Yeah, the running shoes in the fridge?

28:44.320 --> 28:47.600
-I knew I shouldn't have told you that.
-No, I'm glad you did.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.040
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you should have.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.880
It's a startling image.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.000
I mean, I'd probably say
more weird than startling but...

28:55.600 --> 28:57.600
-Really?
-Yeah.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.680
Because I'm saying you should
never let running shoes get cold.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.200
-Is that right?
-Mmm.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.480
All letting running shoes get cold
is gonna do

29:04.600 --> 29:06.800
is stiffen the foam in the midsoles
and the insoles.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.880
And all that's gonna do
is fuck your feet up.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.160
I'm saying, eventually.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.000
It's not something
you and Alice used to do?

29:25.400 --> 29:26.240
Alice...

29:29.520 --> 29:30.360
No.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.000
No, that would have been weird.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.760
But I am right in my thinking, aren't I?

29:39.840 --> 29:42.240
That you and Alice,
the two of you used to go running--

29:42.320 --> 29:43.640
Yeah.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.160
So what?

29:52.760 --> 29:54.800
It was a dream, shoes weren't anyone's.

30:02.520 --> 30:03.360
I mean...

30:07.360 --> 30:09.640
yeah, I still got
a bunch of her stuff, but...

30:10.880 --> 30:11.840
Alice's belongings?

30:16.520 --> 30:18.600
I hope I'm not making you uncomfortable,
Jason.

30:18.680 --> 30:19.680
I don't give a fuck.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.760
Jason, I'm sorry if something I've said
has upset you.

30:23.840 --> 30:24.720
I'm not upset.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.840
[inhales deeply]

30:30.280 --> 30:31.880
Look, I'm not, all right… I just...

30:33.240 --> 30:35.800
Fuck, I don't understand why
you're making a big deal outta this.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.640
I'm interested to know
what you mean by "big deal."

30:37.720 --> 30:38.800
Fuck, you're grilling me.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.280
-It's not my intention.
-Then move us the fuck on and stop--

30:45.760 --> 30:47.000
[exhales sharply]

30:54.720 --> 30:57.120
Jason, I suppose the reason
I brought Alice up...

30:59.800 --> 31:01.400
is because I know
how much she meant to you.

31:03.640 --> 31:06.440
And I know how difficult it is for you
to talk about her.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.120
I don't want our time together
to be difficult

31:09.840 --> 31:10.800
or upsetting.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.360
But it's clear to me
that she meant a great deal to you.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.560
And I worry I wouldn't quite
be doing my job,

31:21.640 --> 31:24.640
if I continued to allow us to avoid
the subject of Alice altogether.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.040
Can I  ask you something?

31:40.240 --> 31:41.640
I have a feeling you're gonna.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.360
You've had sex, right?

31:45.880 --> 31:48.600
-That your question?
-I mean, sort of, but...

31:50.160 --> 31:53.080
and I mean, this is probably
going to sound like, but--

31:54.520 --> 31:59.480
I was wondering, given my lack
of experience, and your actual...

31:59.560 --> 32:03.800
actually having some experience,
I was wondering if maybe we could,

32:04.040 --> 32:07.120
sort of, maybe anyway,
sort of like practice?

32:07.560 --> 32:08.440
Practice?

32:09.000 --> 32:09.880
Yeah.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.160
Practice what?

32:12.120 --> 32:13.040
Like, kissing?

32:14.640 --> 32:15.520
Fingering?

32:16.120 --> 32:18.600
I was thinking maybe too... oral?

32:19.160 --> 32:21.000
Holy shit, you're really serious.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.680
-Is this weird?
-It is pretty weird, Tom, yeah.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.040
I definitely don't want you to feel weird.
It's just...

32:31.280 --> 32:34.320
you know, I've been thinking
if these tickets to the talk,

32:34.400 --> 32:35.840
if they actually do come through.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.960
And even if it's not true,
the thing about Jennifer having fucked--

32:40.040 --> 32:41.200
No, I get it.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.560
I guess I just thought,
it's not like we...

32:49.360 --> 32:52.120
We spend so much time together,
it's sort of like we're related.

32:53.320 --> 32:57.080
And I guess I just figured that it would
be less weird than me sort of...

32:57.720 --> 33:00.280
I want you to imagine asking someone
you're related to

33:00.360 --> 33:01.520
if you could finger them

33:01.880 --> 33:03.200
and tell me that's not weird.

-Yeah, you know what, we'll just...
-Just...

33:10.040 --> 33:11.520
let me think about it. Okay?

33:20.680 --> 33:23.800
[Joy] Imagine eating at the same
restaurant most of your life,

33:24.600 --> 33:26.160
same menu,
same three or four things...

33:26.720 --> 33:29.840
same table, same tablecloth,

33:30.760 --> 33:33.520
same music, same lights.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.680
And then one day,

33:36.840 --> 33:39.200
somebody tells you
about another restaurant.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.520
With a bigger menu,

33:42.320 --> 33:46.000
there's different music playing,
different drinks.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.120
And going to this other restaurant
doesn't mean you have

33:49.200 --> 33:51.520
to stop going to the restaurant
you've gone to all your life.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.000
It just means now you can do both.

33:54.720 --> 33:59.200
And the food you'd grown sick of eating,
it's the same food...

33:59.920 --> 34:02.520
but now somehow it tastes different.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.320
I mean, not better,

34:05.440 --> 34:08.080
but not worse, it really is,
it's just different.

34:09.640 --> 34:10.480
It was...

34:11.360 --> 34:12.600
reinvigorating, then?

34:14.960 --> 34:18.120
Spending that time,
a little time, apart, with someone else...

34:19.240 --> 34:21.680
and then... coming back home.

34:22.520 --> 34:23.600
Coming back together.

34:23.680 --> 34:27.400
Yeah, it was like,
it was like the opposite of jealousy.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.800
-Okay,
-It felt a bit like...

34:30.240 --> 34:32.040
falling in love all over again.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.360
So it was quite an intense...

34:35.440 --> 34:37.760
-Yeah, but good intense.
-Good intense.

34:39.080 --> 34:39.920
Well...

34:41.080 --> 34:42.080
we like the sound of that.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.400
Yeah.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.480
So what's next?

34:46.920 --> 34:48.080
I don't know.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.640
I'd like to try again.
I think we both would.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.800
I'm sensing a "but."

34:56.400 --> 34:59.000
I don't know whether or not
we ought to be worried about the kids?

34:59.760 --> 35:00.600
In what sense?

35:02.000 --> 35:05.600
I just don't want them to think
there's something wrong.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.000
Why do you think
they'll think something's wrong?

35:10.960 --> 35:13.880
Well, their mum and dad
are having sex with other people.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.600
But you're also, for the first time
in a long time,

35:18.720 --> 35:20.720
very nearly having sex with each other.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.160
No?

35:22.840 --> 35:24.440
Unless I have misunderstood.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.640
No, that's...

35:25.720 --> 35:27.760
which is why, I think, you know,
generally speaking,

35:28.800 --> 35:31.600
I'm inclined to think we ought to...

35:33.200 --> 35:34.280
-Keep going.
-Keep going.

35:37.280 --> 35:42.200
Joy, I'm struck by the fact that you seem
to be almost searching for reasons

35:42.280 --> 35:43.800
why this can't work for you.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.200
Searching for disapproval.

Yet here we are...

35:50.360 --> 35:53.360

is much improved.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.480

-Yup,
-Just so I've got this...

48:03.960 --> 48:06.400
the only thing you make is coffee tables?

48:06.640 --> 48:08.360
I'm a big believer in doing one thing,

48:08.440 --> 48:10.200
to the absolute best of your ability.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.280
At work. At home. In the bedroom.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.160
Laura, listen, can I level with you
for a second?

48:21.280 --> 48:23.840
I guess, if you have to,
but for future reference--

48:23.920 --> 48:28.200
I'm not really on the lookout
for anything that serious right now.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.480
Then why does your profile say--

48:31.560 --> 48:33.360
I don't think that we should
let that stop us

48:33.440 --> 48:35.000
from making the most of tonight.

48:35.120 --> 48:35.960
Oh, God.

48:36.040 --> 48:39.440
I'd love the opportunity
to show you a good time tonight, Laura.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.360
You've seen my work.

48:43.440 --> 48:45.080
So you know I'm good with my hands.

a wrong turn?

49:00.000 --> 49:02.040
-Excuse me?
-You're not allowed to be in here.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.040
Well, it's unisex.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.800
In which case, go nuts.

49:14.240 --> 49:15.120
You all right?

49:15.680 --> 49:16.560
What you doing?

49:16.640 --> 49:19.120
I just heard you scream.
I'm just checking you're all right.

49:19.200 --> 49:20.680
Well, obviously I'm not,

49:20.760 --> 49:24.200
but I'm not in the habit of regaling
strange men in toilets with my problems.

49:24.480 --> 49:26.240
What if I told you I'm not that strange?

49:26.360 --> 49:27.760
You know who says things like that?

49:28.440 --> 49:29.920
-Strange people.
-Strange people.

49:33.440 --> 49:34.320
I'm Jason.

49:35.360 --> 49:37.240
I literally just you
saw come out that toilet,

49:37.360 --> 49:38.720
no way am I shaking that hand.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.680
Shit, yeah, sorry.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.440
Seriously, what's up?

49:48.600 --> 49:51.800
It's the strangest thing 'cause we
ain't seen each other for, what?

49:51.960 --> 49:53.240
-Two, three...
-At least.

49:53.320 --> 49:55.040
I'm sorry, you know each other how?

49:56.320 --> 49:57.440
-School.
-Primary.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.960
-Yep. Primary, baby.
-Yeah, those were the days.
