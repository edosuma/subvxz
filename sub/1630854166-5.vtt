calling me Fairfax.

you have to call me Jax.

in and out of jail, rehab.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.694

20:38.113 --> 20:39.740
It fails a lot of us.

- Who failed you?

20:44.119 --> 20:46.872
Was it him or someone else?

20:48.582 --> 20:50.083

20:51.335 --> 20:53.128
what I would do if I were you.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.298
And I think that you should go to trial.

20:56.798 --> 21:00.093
It's risky, but you didn't do this.

21:00.511 --> 21:02.596
You do not deserve to go to prison.
