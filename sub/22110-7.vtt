JEFF PROBST:
Previously on Family Guy...

00:35.219 --> 00:36.853
Certain of his own wit
and intellect,

00:36.886 --> 00:39.189
Brian opened up
a Twitter account.

00:39.223 --> 00:41.725
If you ask me, Twitter is
the perfect place for that guy,

00:41.758 --> 00:43.460
because he's a twit.

00:43.493 --> 00:46.263
PROBST: But an off-color tweet
suddenly made Brian

00:46.296 --> 00:48.465
a pariah to all of Quahog,

00:48.498 --> 00:50.600
forcing the family
to make the difficult choice

00:50.634 --> 00:52.802
of sending him
to a crappy apartment

00:52.836 --> 00:54.338
on the other side of town.

00:55.839 --> 00:57.807
Brian, the family has spoken.

00:57.841 --> 00:59.809
You know,
you're the only man in America

00:59.843 --> 01:02.112
who looks good
in sandals and cargo shorts.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.448
Good luck, everyone.
I'll miss you.

Lois, can we do it over?

No, that's eight times.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.444
We haven't talked
since I moved out,

01:34.478 --> 01:37.247

01:37.281 --> 01:40.450
you're probably on the couch
watching Pawn Stars.

01:40.484 --> 01:43.019
So, uh, pick up.

Okay. Well, again, it's Brian.

really, call me back.

-It's Brian. Bye.

02:04.241 --> 02:05.875
Is your family gonna give you
money for the rent?

02:05.909 --> 02:06.976
Yeah, I'm thinking no.

02:07.010 --> 02:08.545
Well, you got to do something,
Brian.

02:08.578 --> 02:10.347
-You're a week behind.
-Okay, okay.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.848
Look, I'll get a job, okay?

02:11.881 --> 02:13.717
There's got to be something
I can do.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.519
It's not like I'm Ringo.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.787
Well, lads, what do you think
of the new album cover?

02:17.821 --> 02:21.325
Great, but it won't look good
when it's shrunk down for a CD.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.327
CD? What's a CD?

02:23.360 --> 02:25.795
A digital compact disc.

02:25.829 --> 02:27.797
Ringo, are you from the future?

02:27.831 --> 02:29.866
Yeah. And I outlive two of you.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.369
-Which two?
-Yeah, come on, Ringo. Tell us.

02:32.402 --> 02:36.873
Okay, but you all have to agree
to do my song about the octopus.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.208
Hey, before you tell us,

02:38.242 --> 02:40.076
I'm gonna go and smoke
a thousand cigarettes.

02:40.109 --> 02:42.045
And I'm gonna move
to New York City

02:42.078 --> 02:44.381
and walk in and out
of my building.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.821
Okay, everybody, time to go
to Grandma and Grandpa's house.

02:51.855 --> 02:53.923
-They're dead.
-Not your grandparents, Peter.

02:53.957 --> 02:55.392
I'm talking about my parents.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.593
I hate going there.

02:56.626 --> 02:58.828
I'm not allowed to touch
anything in their house.

02:58.862 --> 03:01.265
And, besides, today's
Dolph Lundgren's birthday,

03:01.298 --> 03:03.032
and me and the guys
always celebrate it

03:03.066 --> 03:04.234
by watching Rocky IV.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.503
Fine, we're probably
better off without you.

03:06.536 --> 03:09.606
You always find a way
to embarrass us at my parents'.

Hi. We're concerned that many
of you Family Guy fans under 40

03:34.564 --> 03:35.965
didn't get that reference,

03:35.999 --> 03:39.303
so I'm gonna take you through
the actual commercial.

03:39.336 --> 03:41.305
Okay, typical '80s
stuffy brunch.

03:41.338 --> 03:43.106
Please pass the All Fruit.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.241
Clearly the matriarch.
She's got the most pearls.

Pass the Polaner All Fruit.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.278

Pass the Polaner All Fruit.

Okay, okay, watch. Here's
where it all goes to hell.

Would you please pass the jelly?

-(crashing) -(groans)
-See? He called it jelly.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.288
See... All right, now,
what I don't get is,

03:58.322 --> 03:59.789
if they know this guy,
why are they surprised

03:59.823 --> 04:01.791
by the way he talks? Right?

04:01.825 --> 04:04.628
And if they don't know him,
why is he at the table?

04:04.661 --> 04:06.296
Okay, now you have
the information

04:06.330 --> 04:09.499
that would've made that funny
had you had it going in.

04:13.537 --> 04:15.839
All right,
you ready to watch Rocky IV?

04:15.872 --> 04:18.975

04:30.720 --> 04:33.156
Well, we got to watch the movie.
It's our tradition.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.124
We could just stream it
on your Apple TV.

04:35.158 --> 04:37.627
Is that what that is?
I thought it was a coaster.

04:37.661 --> 04:40.129
I've been putting cold,
wet things on it for a month.

04:40.163 --> 04:43.367
Turn it on. I'm sure we can find
Rocky IV on there.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.771
I don't know how to turn it on.
It doesn't have any buttons.

04:47.804 --> 04:49.339
Well, maybe
it's voice-activated.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.876
Rocky IV! Rocky IV!

Rocky IV

05:06.656 --> 05:08.291

05:08.324 --> 05:09.959

05:09.993 --> 05:11.395
When I was a baby,

05:11.428 --> 05:15.198
they pulled me out of my moms
real slow.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.700

05:35.619 --> 05:37.220
That's, uh, Cyrillic.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.822

Oh, hey, Marth... a.

-I'm always here.

09:58.614 --> 10:00.249
Yeah, so I was thinking,

10:00.283 --> 10:02.351
maybe we could
Netflix and grill.

10:02.385 --> 10:04.453
I think it's
"Netflix and chill."

10:04.487 --> 10:07.123
Oh. Good,
'cause I don't have a grill.

10:07.156 --> 10:08.692
Hey, do you have Netflix?

10:08.725 --> 10:10.326

I've been guessing

Yeah. I mean, except for
Ronan Farrow, who is clearly
