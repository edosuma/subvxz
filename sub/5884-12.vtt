<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

00:03.194 --> 00:04.635
I think it'd be helpful

00:04.786 --> 00:06.603
if you and I were
to meet once a month

00:06.721 --> 00:08.880
just to, you know,
keep up with Sally's progress.

00:09.607 --> 00:12.238
I hate it here.
I really really do.

00:13.023 --> 00:14.023
I won't tell anybody.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.383
I don't have to live
with your shit over my head.

00:17.841 --> 00:20.256
- What's going on?
- We lost Lucky Strike.

00:21.176 --> 00:25.024
I got you a meeting with Heinz. They're
at Ketchum McLeod and they're restless.

00:25.238 --> 00:26.144
You didn't have to do this.

00:28.569 --> 00:29.730
I wanted to.

01:07.898 --> 01:09.899
First I want to assure you

01:09.967 --> 01:12.268
<i>That no one at my agency
knows about this meeting.</i>

01:12.336 --> 01:14.437
<i>- I appreciate that.
- I'm here to help.</i>

01:15.739 --> 01:17.640
I have my own thoughts,

01:17.708 --> 01:21.377
But how would
you describe your...

01:21.445 --> 01:24.280
Well, your
current frustrations?

01:24.348 --> 01:28.151
During the war,
Heinz was all about beans,

01:28.219 --> 01:30.086
But now, obviously,
ketchup is king.

01:30.154 --> 01:33.623
I'm happy for the company, but I'm afraid
we've become the fading older sister.

01:35.626 --> 01:39.629
So ketchup, chili sauce and
soup end up over at d.D.B.

01:39.697 --> 01:42.298
And vinegar, sauces and beans
end up at ketchum MacLeod.

01:42.366 --> 01:44.133
I don't know
why I'm disappointed,

01:44.201 --> 01:47.537
I asked for straightforward.
I just thought they would talk me out of it.

01:47.605 --> 01:50.507
They obviously don't know
what kind of client you are.

01:50.574 --> 01:54.244
Well, I've been working
a long time.

01:54.311 --> 01:57.580
I know that despite
the public's imagination

01:57.648 --> 02:00.650
Food is cyclical.
I don't mean seasonal.

02:00.718 --> 02:03.219
But I mean literally
there's a time for beans

02:03.287 --> 02:04.787
And there's a time for ketchup.

02:04.855 --> 02:07.257
<i>But I don't have
that time,</i>

02:07.324 --> 02:09.324
So I want to force the issue...

02:09.393 --> 02:11.026
You know, something inventive.

02:11.095 --> 02:13.863
Humor worked with pickles,
but pickles are funny.

02:13.931 --> 02:15.932
The way beans are funny,
we can't use that.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.600
We have to fight it, actually.

02:17.668 --> 02:19.969
Well, it's very possible

02:20.037 --> 02:21.771
That Heinz beans
don't need to be funny,

02:21.839 --> 02:24.207
Because they're a food,
not a condiment.

02:24.275 --> 02:27.777
- They're substantial.
- You know, I'd love to have that conversation.

02:27.845 --> 02:29.812
And the reason I agreed
to meet with you is

02:29.880 --> 02:31.614
Because I hoped
it would spark something,

02:31.682 --> 02:35.318
And maybe six to eight months from now
you can call me with a humdinger.

02:35.386 --> 02:37.687
How about six days?

02:37.755 --> 02:40.456
No. No, this is my point.

02:40.524 --> 02:43.693
I want to move, but there's
a lot that goes with it.

02:43.761 --> 02:45.962
There's a breaking-in period...
that's months.

02:46.030 --> 02:48.464
- That's true but...
- I'm sorry to be so blunt,

02:50.467 --> 02:53.403
But I don't know that your company
will be here in six months.

02:54.672 --> 02:55.939
I do.

02:56.006 --> 02:58.408
That's what I'm hoping.

02:58.475 --> 03:00.810
That's why
my answer is not "no,"

03:00.878 --> 03:03.580
It's just "not now."

03:03.647 --> 03:06.282
So where's the harm in coming
in and hearing some ideas?

03:06.350 --> 03:09.686
Because I can't afford
to move my business

03:09.753 --> 03:12.522
A third time in two years.
I just can't.

03:12.590 --> 03:17.026
- I see.
- So that's where we are.

03:17.094 --> 03:18.861
Hold on.

03:18.929 --> 03:21.064
Raymond, I will have
an exciting idea.

03:21.131 --> 03:22.465
I happen to know that.

03:24.335 --> 03:26.903
Would a discounted commission
make up for the break-in period?

03:29.039 --> 03:31.741
I bet I could get a date
with your mother right now.

03:33.177 --> 03:35.845
Well, you can see why
I don't want to let this go.

03:35.913 --> 03:38.881
Look, don, you're a hell
of an idea man,

03:38.949 --> 03:41.618
But let the account boys
do this part.

03:43.887 --> 03:46.222
I wish you the best of luck.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.358
Thank you.
It was really great to meet you.

03:57.401 --> 03:59.402
Excuse me, waiter.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.304
<i>Sally, Bobby!</i>

04:13.384 --> 04:14.817
You're filthy.

04:17.821 --> 04:19.689
Can I take it away from him?

04:19.757 --> 04:21.658
The spoon or the screaming... take your pick.

04:24.928 --> 04:26.362
I want two hot dogs.

04:26.430 --> 04:28.264
Your eyes are bigger
than your stomach.

04:28.332 --> 04:30.166
How come we never eat
with Henry?

04:30.234 --> 04:31.901
First of all,
he works until late

04:31.969 --> 04:33.703
And you're always
saying "I'm hungry."

04:33.771 --> 04:35.505
Second of all,
you don't eat the same food.

04:35.572 --> 04:37.106
I'll try new food.

04:38.442 --> 04:40.209
Would you like
to eat with Henry?

04:40.277 --> 04:42.512
Why don't Bobby
and gene eat first

04:42.579 --> 04:44.013
And I'll wait to eat
with you and Henry?

04:45.416 --> 04:46.949
Okay.

04:47.017 --> 04:48.651
Let me think about it.

04:48.719 --> 04:50.353
Okay.

04:52.022 --> 04:54.624
You're paying me
to assess your situation,

04:54.692 --> 04:57.527
But I could've told you
fr three blocks away

04:57.594 --> 05:00.396
That signing new business...
matter what the size...

05:00.464 --> 05:02.131
Is of the essence.

05:02.199 --> 05:05.501
Not only because your
billings have shrunk by 50%,

05:05.569 --> 05:08.371
But because there's not much
time before you'll be perceived

05:08.439 --> 05:09.739
As stagnant...

05:09.807 --> 05:11.841
Worse, decaying.

05:11.909 --> 05:15.044
Listen, doctor, we know there's
a black spot on the X-ray.

05:15.112 --> 05:16.746
You don't have to keep
tapping your finger on it.

05:16.814 --> 05:19.849
I recommend that you do
what you do best...

05:19.917 --> 05:23.419
Cigarettes.
You understand the f.T.C.

05:23.487 --> 05:24.821
You understand
the surgeon general.

05:24.888 --> 05:26.489
You have a team in place

05:26.557 --> 05:29.525
With account management
and media expertise

05:29.593 --> 05:31.160
Which is up and running.

05:31.228 --> 05:33.763
And, of course, you have don.

05:33.831 --> 05:36.032
<i>You are a certain
kind of girl,</i>

05:36.100 --> 05:40.069
And tobacco is
your ideal boyfriend.

05:40.137 --> 05:43.406
Can you get us a date?

05:43.474 --> 05:46.175
Philip Morris is introducing
a new brand for young women,

05:46.243 --> 05:48.845
Hoping to have it
on the market in 18 months,

05:48.912 --> 05:51.714
And they'd like a new agency
on it from the ground floor.

05:51.782 --> 05:54.984
- How much is it?
- Close to $5 million.

05:55.052 --> 05:56.753
It's a start.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.588
Wonderful.

05:58.655 --> 06:01.491
And what stage of the process
has your influence bought us?

06:01.558 --> 06:03.392
A meeting.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.328
No one else has one.

06:05.395 --> 06:08.431
We will listen more
than we will speak.

06:08.499 --> 06:10.900
Like a good girlfriend.

06:10.968 --> 06:13.803
- Sounds great.
- I concur.

06:16.940 --> 06:19.976
All I'm saying is we should be going
after something as big as what we had.

06:20.043 --> 06:22.211
It'd cost a fortune to pursue

06:22.279 --> 06:23.379
When one is in review.

06:23.447 --> 06:25.681
They're impossible to pry away.

06:25.749 --> 06:27.850
Our day-to-day payroll
will be beyond us

06:27.918 --> 06:29.519
By the next billing cycle.

06:29.586 --> 06:32.655
we should start
thinking about reducing staff

06:32.723 --> 06:34.357
And subletting
the square footage.

06:34.424 --> 06:35.424
Why even have an office?

06:35.492 --> 06:38.060
Why don't we just
work out of a cab?

06:38.128 --> 06:39.629
And where does that leave me?

06:39.696 --> 06:41.030
Trying to get my calls returned

06:41.098 --> 06:43.132
With all the buying power
of secor laxative?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.134
We gave him don
and a finder's fee.

06:45.202 --> 06:48.271
- He should've aimed higher.
- I just left Geyer for this.

06:48.338 --> 06:49.972
Do you think those clients
are in love with me?

06:50.040 --> 06:51.507
I'm getting married in October!

06:51.575 --> 06:53.176
It's gonna be
"barefoot in the park."

06:53.243 --> 06:54.844
These things go in streaks.

06:54.912 --> 06:56.646
And don draper
with a cigarette company?

06:56.713 --> 06:59.448
We get this vote of confidence
and we move from there.

06:59.516 --> 07:01.818
Marlboro was
their women's cigarette.

07:03.821 --> 07:05.855
Well, they certainly ran away
from that in the right direction.

07:07.858 --> 07:11.460
You know, bes, vinegars and
sauces was very impressed.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.964
Thank you for that,

07:15.032 --> 07:16.933
But thank you
much more for this.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.801
This is what I was hoping for.

07:18.869 --> 07:21.504
Good.
Geoff's excited.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.472
Study up.

07:28.245 --> 07:32.014
I have dinner plans
but call me tonight,

07:32.082 --> 07:33.950
Even if it's just to work.

07:38.689 --> 07:41.724
It's a summer practice helmet.
It's not as good.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.626
It smells.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.431
Well, you're there
all the time.

07:48.498 --> 07:51.200
- What do you talk about?
- Didn't you go?

07:51.268 --> 07:53.402
Yeah, but psychiatrists
are easy to fool.

07:53.470 --> 07:55.504
Dr. Edna's smart.

07:55.572 --> 07:57.540
She tell you
to kiss your mom's ass?

07:57.608 --> 07:59.408
No.

07:59.476 --> 08:01.444
So who's smarter, me or her?

08:04.882 --> 08:06.515
You want one?

08:06.583 --> 08:08.184
No.

08:10.787 --> 08:12.521
Do you talk
to your mom about me?

08:13.790 --> 08:15.892
I did and I don't anymore.

08:18.195 --> 08:20.529
She doesn't like me.

08:20.597 --> 08:23.366
She thinks...
she doesn't like kids.

08:23.433 --> 08:25.668
That's not true.

08:25.736 --> 08:27.803
You're the one who's always
saying how mean she is.

08:27.871 --> 08:29.472
So what?

08:38.181 --> 08:40.216
- I've gotta go.
- Okay.

08:42.619 --> 08:44.186
See you later, alligator.

08:49.660 --> 08:50.793
<i>Don.</i>

08:56.967 --> 08:58.801
Midge.

09:05.275 --> 09:07.209
I just came out from a meeting

09:07.277 --> 09:09.612
At a magazine related
to time life

09:09.680 --> 09:12.348
<i>And I saw
this dashing figure.</i>

09:12.416 --> 09:15.184
Where are you going
with so much purpose?

09:15.252 --> 09:18.654
Home. You look good.

09:18.722 --> 09:22.224
I'm skinny.
Starving artist.

09:22.292 --> 09:24.560
- Did you move here?
- Yes.

09:24.628 --> 09:27.997
Well, I have my own firm now.

09:28.065 --> 09:30.366
Ooh. Draper,
draper & draper?

09:30.434 --> 09:32.435
Sterling Cooper draper Pryce.

09:32.502 --> 09:35.104
Well, it sounds impressive.

09:35.172 --> 09:38.341
There are good days and bad
days like anything else.

09:38.408 --> 09:39.809
So you wouldn't happen to need

09:39.876 --> 09:41.911
Any freelance artists,
would you?

09:41.979 --> 09:43.479
I wish I could help right now.

09:43.547 --> 09:45.614
Maybe in six months.

09:45.682 --> 09:47.850
You can use me as a reference.

09:47.918 --> 09:49.685
Really?

09:51.254 --> 09:52.788
I thought I would've run
into you in the village.

09:54.691 --> 09:56.425
I'm always expecting
to see you in the park.

09:56.493 --> 09:59.395
What are you doing
in the village?

09:59.463 --> 10:01.964
Admiring the wildlife?

10:02.032 --> 10:04.800
I live there, on Waverly.

10:07.471 --> 10:09.805
Yeah.

10:09.873 --> 10:12.908
So what's the rush to go home?

10:12.976 --> 10:14.577
Come over.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.648
I have a big meeting tomorrow.
Maybe some other time.

10:19.716 --> 10:21.350
Not even to meet my husband?

10:23.387 --> 10:26.288
- Really?
- We, it's not romantic.

10:26.356 --> 10:28.791
We just got married
for the bread.

10:28.859 --> 10:32.595
We'll eat.
You'll buy a painting.

10:32.662 --> 10:34.663
I'll cheer you up.

10:37.801 --> 10:40.369
Look, I lost my purse.
At least give me a ride downtown.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.474
Okay.

10:49.846 --> 10:51.981
I told her I brushed my teeth,

10:52.049 --> 10:54.283
But she said I still
smelled like spaghetti.

10:54.351 --> 10:55.851
And what did you do?

10:55.919 --> 10:58.387
I brushed my teeth again.

10:58.455 --> 11:00.356
And what did she do?

11:00.424 --> 11:02.525
She doesn't care
what the truth is

11:02.592 --> 11:04.960
As long as I do what she says.

11:05.028 --> 11:06.762
Got any sevens?

11:06.830 --> 11:09.198
Nope. Go fish.

11:11.435 --> 11:14.170
- I hate sevens.
- Why?

11:15.338 --> 11:17.373
I just do.

11:18.675 --> 11:20.209
You know, I'm very proud

11:20.277 --> 11:22.778
Of how you found a way
to behave so well,

11:22.846 --> 11:25.314
Even when you get so angry
at your mother sometimes.

11:26.917 --> 11:30.019
It's hard to control ourselves
when we get so angry.

11:30.087 --> 11:32.988
She just doesn't know
that I'm mad.

11:33.056 --> 11:35.357
As long as you know it.

11:35.425 --> 11:39.462
I told you your mom acts that
way because she has stresses,

11:39.529 --> 11:42.898
Not because you're bad or
that you did anything wrong.

11:42.966 --> 11:44.233
I know.

11:46.837 --> 11:50.206
- Do you have any aces?
- No, go fish.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.277
So now that
you're back in school,

11:55.345 --> 11:57.613
We probably should be seeing a
little less of each other...

11:57.681 --> 12:01.550
Just one day a week... so
that you can ride your bike,

12:01.618 --> 12:05.054
Be with your friends
and be in the ballet recital.

12:05.122 --> 12:06.555
Okay.

12:08.925 --> 12:10.226
Do you have any threes?

12:14.564 --> 12:16.432
I said I'm very proud of you.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.801
Did you hear that?

12:24.708 --> 12:26.275
Do you have any Jacks?

12:35.576 --> 12:37.477
Perry, we have company.

12:39.179 --> 12:41.814
- This is my friend don.
- Perry. Nice to meet you.

12:41.882 --> 12:43.716
- Sorry to drop in.
- Oh no.

12:43.784 --> 12:45.485
Why don't you offer don drink?

12:45.552 --> 12:48.321
- Uh, sure.
- Don, what are you gonna have?

12:48.388 --> 12:50.356
I have...

12:51.592 --> 12:53.226
Vodka or brown.

12:53.293 --> 12:55.561
- Whiskey's good.
- Good.

12:55.629 --> 12:57.730
Good. I'll get
a couple of glasses.

13:00.300 --> 13:04.337
- So you're a playwright?
- When we met, I said he looked like Brendan Behan.

13:04.404 --> 13:06.639
you said Dylan Thomas.

13:12.146 --> 13:13.379
Here we go.

13:14.548 --> 13:15.882
To welcome company.

13:23.724 --> 13:26.392
Let me go freshen up and make
sure we have toilet paper.

13:29.630 --> 13:32.465
So, don, let me open
your eyes for a minute.

13:32.533 --> 13:33.766
Come here.

13:41.608 --> 13:43.409
Can you believe this?

13:44.912 --> 13:47.113
- What's it called?
- "number four."

13:47.181 --> 13:50.583
The whole thing is about what she
sees when she closes her eyes.

13:50.651 --> 13:51.851
It's part of this thing
that she's doing.

13:51.919 --> 13:53.319
It's called an afterimage.

13:53.387 --> 13:54.754
What's more real?

13:54.822 --> 13:56.756
It's nice.

13:56.824 --> 13:59.725
You know, I have
a price list somewhere.

13:59.793 --> 14:01.661
Of course, you know, whatever
you're willing to pay.

14:01.728 --> 14:03.863
I mean, I know she'd love
for you to have one.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.134
Let me think about it.

14:09.436 --> 14:11.270
You know,

14:11.338 --> 14:13.706
It's not hard to see things
are a little tough around here,

14:13.774 --> 14:16.976
But she digs you.

14:17.044 --> 14:19.445
And I could tell you

14:19.513 --> 14:21.147
She'd do anything
if you bought one.

14:23.016 --> 14:24.650
You're sure about that?

14:24.718 --> 14:26.786
We're not possessive,

14:26.854 --> 14:29.989
And you should've heard how excited
she was when she tracked you down.

14:30.057 --> 14:31.357
What?

14:33.627 --> 14:35.494
<i>You know,
the look on her face when</i>

14:35.562 --> 14:36.796
<i>- She walked in here with you.</i>

14:39.933 --> 14:42.435
I knew I shouldn't have
left you two alone.

14:42.502 --> 14:44.604
Are you kidding?
We're getting along famously.

14:44.671 --> 14:47.640
You know what?
I'm gonna get some groceries

14:47.708 --> 14:49.208
And whip up a great meal.

14:50.711 --> 14:53.713
Oh. Midge?

14:53.780 --> 14:56.515
- Honey?
- She lost her purse.

14:56.583 --> 14:59.218
Oh, right.

14:59.286 --> 15:01.454
Don, don't.

15:01.521 --> 15:03.389
My father owned a restaurant.

15:03.457 --> 15:05.458
I can make chicken cordon bleu.

15:05.525 --> 15:07.526
Here. How about that?

15:09.997 --> 15:11.464
$10?

15:12.766 --> 15:14.700
Well, okay.

15:14.768 --> 15:16.636
You two sit tight.

15:16.703 --> 15:18.537
I'll be right back.

15:28.482 --> 15:30.383
- He's very interesting.
- He's an idiot.

15:31.852 --> 15:33.586
He's just gonna go out
and put that in his arm.

15:35.856 --> 15:37.723
And you could've gotten
so much more from me.

15:39.059 --> 15:40.593
That's why you tracked me down

15:40.661 --> 15:42.995
Like James Bond.

15:43.063 --> 15:45.831
Oh God.

15:45.899 --> 15:47.900
He's such an idiot.

15:51.672 --> 15:53.906
I just wanted you
to buy a painting.

15:56.576 --> 15:58.144
I swear.

16:05.285 --> 16:06.886
What's it like?

16:09.022 --> 16:11.390
It's like

16:11.458 --> 16:14.360
Drinking 100 bottles of whiskey

16:14.428 --> 16:16.595
While someone licks your tits.

16:19.566 --> 16:21.334
I can see it's very good.

16:23.870 --> 16:26.706
He said it would help me
take my mind off my work.

16:28.075 --> 16:30.710
Turns out
it's a full-time job.

16:32.079 --> 16:33.646
Why don't you stop?

16:36.350 --> 16:38.217
I know it's bad for me, but...

16:39.386 --> 16:41.654
It's heroin, don.

16:44.191 --> 16:46.459
I just can't stop.

16:50.464 --> 16:52.164
I am glad

16:53.400 --> 16:56.068
To see you, you know?

17:09.449 --> 17:10.883
I...

17:10.951 --> 17:13.185
This is $300.

17:15.989 --> 17:18.991
You know, for "number
four" over there.

17:22.462 --> 17:24.195
Don.

17:24.263 --> 17:27.733
What am I gonna do
with a check?

17:41.982 --> 17:43.582
Here's $120 in cash.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.534
Do you think
my work's any good?

18:03.070 --> 18:05.404
It doesn't matter.

18:10.444 --> 18:12.144
You know, I don't even
have car fare.

18:12.212 --> 18:14.113
You can walk across the park.

18:14.181 --> 18:16.982
Do some advertising for me.

18:17.050 --> 18:19.185
Like a sandwich board.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.929
It's really great
to see you, don.

18:36.837 --> 18:38.737
I'm glad you haven't changed.

18:46.413 --> 18:48.547
It was the way he slammed
the car door like that.

18:48.615 --> 18:50.349
It was so dismissive.

18:50.417 --> 18:52.084
It reminded me of don,

18:52.152 --> 18:54.954
But of course it wasn't.

18:55.021 --> 18:56.889
When I confronted him later,

18:56.957 --> 18:58.891
It turned out
he hadn't heard me.

18:58.959 --> 19:01.460
That's what he said, anyway.

19:01.528 --> 19:03.996
Well, you learned
something, didn't you?

19:05.699 --> 19:06.866
I did.

19:08.568 --> 19:10.569
Our time is almost up,

19:10.637 --> 19:12.571
So I thought that
I should tell you that

19:12.639 --> 19:15.274
I believe Sally has made
wonderful progress

19:15.342 --> 19:17.510
And that I'd like
to reduce her sessions

19:17.577 --> 19:19.245
To once a week
and see where we are.

19:21.748 --> 19:23.115
So she's cured?

19:24.718 --> 19:27.119
She's not better.

19:27.187 --> 19:30.556
- She ran away. - And she
understands what she did was wrong

19:30.624 --> 19:32.892
And she's been
very responsible since.

19:32.959 --> 19:34.827
Her life is chaotic

19:34.895 --> 19:37.897
And I'm afraid of her
losing this influence.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.701
I've noticed that every
time you come in here

19:42.769 --> 19:45.404
You have many things
on your mind.

19:45.472 --> 19:49.341
And I feel that you
should have your own time

19:49.409 --> 19:52.545
<i>Where you get to say
everything you want to say.</i>

19:52.612 --> 19:54.947
I have
a very talented colleague,

19:55.015 --> 19:57.416
Dr. Evelyn Shapiro,
whom I can recommend.

19:57.484 --> 19:59.451
Why can't I talk to you?

19:59.519 --> 20:01.787
Betty, you can talk to me

20:01.855 --> 20:03.722
But, you know,

20:03.790 --> 20:06.926
I'm a child psychiatrist.

20:06.993 --> 20:10.362
Well, I don't need
a psychiatrist.

20:10.430 --> 20:11.764
I just...

20:13.433 --> 20:16.168
Obviously I'm willing to do
whatever you recommend

20:16.236 --> 20:19.171
As Sally progresses.

20:19.239 --> 20:21.373
And I would hope,

20:21.441 --> 20:22.975
Of course,

20:23.043 --> 20:25.744
That if she continues
to make progress

20:25.812 --> 20:28.480
That we could continue
to discuss that.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.421
Of course.

20:36.823 --> 20:39.191
So I'll keep you
in the books for next month.

20:39.259 --> 20:41.460
If you think so.

20:51.688 --> 20:53.522
Peter piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

20:56.226 --> 20:59.228
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.

20:59.296 --> 21:01.564
you wanted to see me?

21:01.631 --> 21:03.265
I did. Did you do
all the reading?

21:03.333 --> 21:05.000
- Yes.
- If strategy comes up...

21:05.068 --> 21:06.602
And it usually doesn't
at this point...

21:06.670 --> 21:09.004
What do you think they think the
strength is of this product?

21:09.072 --> 21:11.340
Well, as you know,
it's pointless

21:11.408 --> 21:13.776
To get women to switch from
men's brands... nobody switches.

21:15.946 --> 21:17.980
They're probably looking for a new
way to give 'em out for free.

21:20.150 --> 21:23.118
Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Draper, Dr.
Atherton is on his way up,

21:23.186 --> 21:25.087
The partners are
gathering in the lobby

21:25.155 --> 21:27.323
- And Dr. Miller called to say break a leg.
- Thank you.

21:29.459 --> 21:31.493
What were you saying?

21:31.561 --> 21:33.028
I was saying
you're gonna do great.

21:49.145 --> 21:50.346
Morning.

21:52.782 --> 21:55.451
I'm afraid I have
some unfortunate news.

21:57.354 --> 21:59.455
They canceled the meeting.

21:59.522 --> 22:01.056
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

22:01.124 --> 22:03.826
They decided to give
it to Leo Burnett.

22:03.893 --> 22:05.728
Burnett has Marlboro already.

22:05.795 --> 22:07.663
- I thought they wanted a fresh
start with this. - So did I.

22:07.731 --> 22:10.432
They're excited to see where
you are in six months.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.202
Six months means never.
They're letting us die.

22:13.269 --> 22:15.137
I thought this was
a sure thing.

22:15.205 --> 22:17.406
Down the road perhaps.

22:17.474 --> 22:19.375
There's no reason
to be discouraged.

22:19.442 --> 22:21.443
The wind is blowing
ice cold out there.

22:21.511 --> 22:23.412
We can't even get a meeting
with a damn tobacco account!

22:23.480 --> 22:24.813
Take it inside.

22:30.120 --> 22:31.754
You're an asshole,
you know that?

22:42.899 --> 22:45.100
Mr. Crane, out.

22:52.776 --> 22:54.943
They can't even dignify
us with an excuse?

22:55.011 --> 22:57.346
<i>They don't need an excuse.
It's because we're desperate.</i>

22:57.414 --> 22:59.815
<i>They can smell it on us.
We reek of it</i>

22:59.883 --> 23:01.984
Like some sweaty salesman
knocking on his last door!

23:02.052 --> 23:03.752
Because we're going
after scraps.

23:03.820 --> 23:06.221
What about United airlines,
general motors?

23:06.289 --> 23:08.524
- Do you think that's easier?
- Than what? You have a plan?

23:08.591 --> 23:10.592
<i>I'm out there beating the
bushes every day for anything.</i>

23:10.660 --> 23:14.229
- You should try it.
- Just out of caution, I met with the bank.

23:14.297 --> 23:16.398
<i>They've agreed to extend
our line of credit,</i>

23:16.466 --> 23:18.033
But they would like us
to post some collateral.

23:18.101 --> 23:20.002
You went to the bank?
There's a vote of confidence.

23:20.070 --> 23:23.639
$100,000 each
from the senior partners

23:23.707 --> 23:25.741
And $50,000 from
Mr. Campbell and I

23:25.809 --> 23:27.743
<i>Would buy us
six months or so,</i>

23:27.811 --> 23:30.813
Provided we make a drastic
reduction in staff.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.981
<i>$50,000?
Absolutely not.</i>

23:33.049 --> 23:35.684
It's an obligation
of your contract.

23:35.752 --> 23:37.553
All we need is a bridge
to cold and flu season

23:37.620 --> 23:39.288
And Vicks will take us
to the holidays.

23:39.355 --> 23:42.558
Sugarberry hams will
pick up. Samsonite...

23:42.625 --> 23:45.094
It's a hardship for me as
well, but it's a necessity.

23:45.161 --> 23:46.829
<i>We should move.
We should never have been here.</i>

23:46.896 --> 23:48.597
<i>You think we
look desperate now?</i>

23:48.665 --> 23:51.934
Well, if you figure it out,
you know where to find me...

23:52.001 --> 23:53.702
For a little while anyway.

23:59.042 --> 24:01.543
And then I was
floating over town...

24:01.611 --> 24:03.879
Standing straight up,
not like superman.

24:03.947 --> 24:06.815
Only it wasn't ossining,
it was London...

24:06.883 --> 24:08.317
Like Mary Poppins.

24:09.552 --> 24:11.186
Do you want the backwash?

24:17.026 --> 24:19.027
I fly in some of my dreams.

24:19.095 --> 24:21.130
It feels like
being in the ocean.

24:21.197 --> 24:23.966
I just felt like
I was going to heaven,

24:24.033 --> 24:26.268
Except I don't believe in it.

24:26.336 --> 24:29.071
You don't?
Then what happens when you die?

24:29.139 --> 24:32.474
- Nothing?
- It doesn't really bother me,

24:32.542 --> 24:34.409
Except for it's forever.

24:34.477 --> 24:36.345
When I think about forever,
I get upset.

24:37.847 --> 24:39.448
Like the land o' lakes butter

24:39.516 --> 24:42.818
Has that Indian girl...
sitting, holding a box.

24:42.886 --> 24:46.054
And it has a picture of her
on it, holding a box.

24:46.122 --> 24:48.457
With a picture of her
on it, holding a box.

24:48.525 --> 24:50.692
Have you ever noticed that?

24:52.629 --> 24:54.329
I wish y wouldn't
have said that.

24:54.397 --> 24:56.265
Sorry.

24:56.332 --> 24:58.267
I have to go.

24:58.334 --> 25:00.702
Yeah, I should too.

25:06.743 --> 25:08.443
I'll save my fritos for you.

25:15.819 --> 25:18.954
- May I speak with you?
- Are you busy?

25:19.022 --> 25:21.423
No. Do you want one?

25:21.491 --> 25:22.758
No.

25:24.127 --> 25:26.361
Philip Morris
set up the meeting

25:26.429 --> 25:29.631
Then told Leo Burnett about it
to leverage a sweeter deal.

25:29.699 --> 25:33.302
So they used us.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

25:33.369 --> 25:36.405
Everyone at Burnett is already bragging
about how we never even got a meeting.

25:36.472 --> 25:38.373
What do you want?

25:38.441 --> 25:40.209
I want to know
why I'm being punished

25:40.276 --> 25:42.444
For being the only business
left around here.

25:42.512 --> 25:45.747
- We're all being punished.
- I don't have that kind of money.

25:45.815 --> 25:49.084
Pete, I'm doing everything I can.
Get me in a room.

25:51.321 --> 25:52.688
<i>Miss Olson to see you.</i>

25:52.755 --> 25:54.756
<i>- Come in!</i>

25:57.160 --> 25:59.261
Everybody's waiting
in the conference room.

25:59.329 --> 26:02.564
- For what? - Well, we were all
gonna leave when you left,

26:02.632 --> 26:06.168
But you didn't go,
so what should we do?

26:06.236 --> 26:09.271
- I don't care.
- What happened?

26:09.339 --> 26:11.707
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

26:11.774 --> 26:13.942
What are we gonna do?

26:14.010 --> 26:15.510
Peggy, it's not your problem.

26:15.578 --> 26:18.247
I know, but I have been
thinking about the company

26:18.314 --> 26:21.316
And I was wondering
what you thought about...

26:21.384 --> 26:24.119
You know, why don't
we just change our name?

26:24.187 --> 26:26.021
If this was a dog food,
we'd change the name.

26:27.657 --> 26:30.359
We can't start over.
We just started.

26:30.426 --> 26:32.361
You always say "if you don't like
what they're saying about you,

26:32.428 --> 26:34.563
- Change the conversation."
- to what?

26:34.631 --> 26:36.498
What they're saying
about us is true.

26:36.566 --> 26:38.767
So there's nothing we can do?

26:38.835 --> 26:40.669
Sure there is.
We're gonna sit at our desks

26:40.737 --> 26:43.171
And keep typing while the
walls fall down around us,

26:43.239 --> 26:45.073
Because we're creative,

26:45.141 --> 26:47.109
The least important
most-important thing there is.

27:01.484 --> 27:03.185
You can't slam
the door like that.

27:05.455 --> 27:06.922
Why didn't you call me back?

27:06.990 --> 27:09.524
The bank called.
Something about a loan application?

27:10.793 --> 27:13.362
- They called here?
- Yes.

27:14.731 --> 27:16.832
You have something
you want to tell me?

27:18.368 --> 27:19.801
It's not important.

27:22.338 --> 27:24.740
To think you still
want to surprise me

27:24.807 --> 27:26.341
After five years of marriage.

27:28.311 --> 27:30.646
When can I start looking?
I'm so in love with Greenwich.

27:32.115 --> 27:34.116
We're not buying
a house, Trudy.

27:35.518 --> 27:37.919
The partners each need
to put in a lump sum

27:37.987 --> 27:40.088
To keep the payroll
we have going,

27:40.156 --> 27:42.224
So people don't lose
their jobs.

27:43.426 --> 27:45.694
What?
How much?

27:45.762 --> 27:48.163
Well, it's $50,000

27:48.231 --> 27:49.865
And we have $22,000
in the bank,

27:49.932 --> 27:51.733
Not counting the baby gifts...

27:51.801 --> 27:53.402
Which will remain for the baby.

27:53.469 --> 27:57.339
It's all for the baby, for Tammy
to have a yard to run around in.

27:57.407 --> 28:00.409
Central park was
good enough for me.

28:00.476 --> 28:04.212
When you bet big and lose,
you don't double down.

28:04.280 --> 28:07.349
It's in my contract.
I'll lose my partnership.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.651
You'll lose your stateroom
on the Titanic?

28:09.719 --> 28:12.554
You are forbidden to give
anything more to that company.

28:12.622 --> 28:15.023
you don't
get to forbid me.

28:15.091 --> 28:16.892
lower your voice!

28:16.959 --> 28:19.528
And don't even think
about asking my father.

29:31.901 --> 29:35.070
<i>"why I'm quitting tobacco.</i>

29:39.542 --> 29:42.177
<i>Recently,
my advertising agency</i>

29:42.245 --> 29:44.346
<i>Ended a long relationship</i>

29:44.414 --> 29:45.714
<i>With lucky strike
cigarettes.</i>

29:47.150 --> 29:49.251
<i>And I'm relieved.</i>

29:51.020 --> 29:54.022
<i>For over 25 years,
we devoted ourselves</i>

29:54.090 --> 29:55.657
<i>To peddling a product</i>

29:55.725 --> 29:58.727
<i>For which good work
is irrelevant,</i>

30:00.630 --> 30:02.697
<i>Because people can't stop
themselves from buying it."</i>

30:04.367 --> 30:05.867
<i>"the product
that never improves,</i>

30:05.935 --> 30:09.971
<i>Causes illness
and makes people unhappy.</i>

30:13.843 --> 30:15.477
<i>But there was
money in it.</i>

30:16.779 --> 30:18.380
<i>A lot of money.</i>

30:22.018 --> 30:25.754
<i>In fact, our entire
business depended on it.</i>

30:28.224 --> 30:29.991
<i>We knew
it wasn't good for us,</i>

30:30.059 --> 30:31.927
<i>But we couldn't stop.</i>

30:33.796 --> 30:35.530
<i>And then,
when lucky strike moved</i>

30:35.598 --> 30:37.666
<i>Their business elsewhere,</i>

30:37.733 --> 30:42.003
<i>I realized here was my chance to
be someone who can sleep at night</i>

30:42.071 --> 30:43.905
<i>Because I know
what I'm selling</i>

30:43.973 --> 30:45.807
<i>Doesn't kill
my customers.</i>

30:45.875 --> 30:48.610
<i>So as of today,
sterling Cooper draper Pryce</i>

30:48.678 --> 30:50.312
<i>Will no longer take
tobacco accounts.</i>

30:50.379 --> 30:52.881
<i>We know
it's gonna be hard.</i>

30:52.949 --> 30:54.749
<i>If you're interested
in cigarette work,</i>

30:54.817 --> 30:56.885
<i>Here's a list of agencies
that do it well:</i>

30:56.953 --> 31:00.388
<i>B.B.D.O., Leo Burnett,
McCann-Erickson,</i>

31:00.456 --> 31:03.325
<i>Cutler, Gleason & Chaough
and Benton & Bowles."</i>

31:03.392 --> 31:06.895
<i>"as for us,
we welcome all other business,</i>

31:06.963 --> 31:09.664
Because we're certain that our
best work is still ahead of us.

31:09.732 --> 31:12.567
<i>Sincerely,
Donald f. Draper,</i>

31:12.635 --> 31:15.437
<i>Creative director, sterling
Cooper draper Pryce."</i>

31:18.941 --> 31:21.376
- Good morning, don.
- Stan.

31:23.579 --> 31:25.347
Good morning.

31:26.782 --> 31:30.418
Good morning.
Any calls?

31:30.486 --> 31:32.654
Oh yes, quite a few.

31:32.722 --> 31:34.556
Mostly reporters and citizens,

31:34.624 --> 31:36.925
- Dr. Miller.
- Anyone else?

31:36.993 --> 31:39.794
Someone named Emerson Foote

31:39.862 --> 31:42.898
And people from those
agencies you mentioned.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.634
They're looking for you.

31:50.139 --> 31:51.506
Can you get Dr. Miller?

31:52.842 --> 31:54.509
Somebody used your name
to end our business

31:54.577 --> 31:56.044
In the newspaper.

31:56.112 --> 31:58.947
- It's not you, is it?
- It's suicide!

31:59.015 --> 32:00.882
It's insane!
How the hell could you do this?

32:00.950 --> 32:03.518
- Why would you do this?
- Because someone had to do something.

32:03.586 --> 32:05.520
You put the company name on it.

32:05.588 --> 32:06.955
You should've consulted us.

32:07.023 --> 32:09.391
Why? To evaluate its
strengths and weaknesses?

32:09.458 --> 32:11.760
To knock it down to risk versus reward?
It's done!

32:11.827 --> 32:14.229
And I slept last night
for the first time in a month.

32:14.297 --> 32:15.964
You slept?
Really?

32:16.032 --> 32:18.166
You weren't smiling, thinking
about the taste of shit

32:18.234 --> 32:19.734
That would be in everybody's
mouth over breakfast today?

32:19.802 --> 32:22.203
No one asked you
to euthanize this company.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.372
What did you expect, for
us to pat you on the back?

32:24.440 --> 32:26.641
Don't you realize the clients
are all going to think

32:26.709 --> 32:28.176
You could turn on them
at any minute?

32:28.244 --> 32:30.312
I'm not going to explain
to you what I did.

32:30.379 --> 32:32.581
It's an ad for this agency.

32:32.648 --> 32:34.816
If you don't understand it, then
you shouldn't be in this business.

32:34.884 --> 32:37.419
You humiliated us
by not putting

32:37.486 --> 32:39.154
Our names on it.

32:39.221 --> 32:41.923
You left us
with this hypocrisy.

32:41.991 --> 32:44.225
So deny it! I did what I thought
was best for the company.

32:44.293 --> 32:45.860
You can either back me or not.

32:45.928 --> 32:48.063
You did what was best for you,

32:48.130 --> 32:50.732
Because you're impatient
and childish.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.335
You had a tantrum on a full
page in "the New York times."

32:55.371 --> 32:57.305
So no one is happy about this?

32:59.008 --> 33:01.176
I don't know.
It's good enough to be the reason

33:01.243 --> 33:03.078
This place went down anymore.

33:03.145 --> 33:05.780
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

33:05.848 --> 33:08.750
Um, there's someone calling
from senator Kennedy's office.

33:08.818 --> 33:11.086
Robert Kennedy
wants to speak with you.

33:21.063 --> 33:22.597
<i>Please
hold for the senator.</i>

33:22.665 --> 33:24.332
<i>Is this here don draper?</i>

33:24.400 --> 33:26.868
<i>- Yes.
- This is Bobby Kennedy.</i>

33:26.936 --> 33:28.403
<i>How are you
this lovely morning?</i>

33:30.072 --> 33:32.440
I'm well.
Thank you, senator.

33:32.508 --> 33:34.643
<i>Bobby please.
Listen,</i>

33:34.710 --> 33:36.578
<i>I just wanted
to say that I admire</i>

33:36.646 --> 33:38.980
<i>Your fortitude and vigor</i>

33:39.048 --> 33:40.949
<i>Avd standing up
to what I consider to be</i>

33:41.017 --> 33:44.919
<i>One of the great menaces to this
civilization as we know it.</i>

33:44.987 --> 33:48.390
<i>- That's very flattering.
- I have one question:</i>

33:48.457 --> 33:52.494
<i>- Does your company represent secor laxatives?
- Yes. Yes, we do.</i>

33:52.561 --> 33:54.663
<i>Well, are you going to be
writing anything against them?</i>

33:54.730 --> 33:55.997
<i>Because I want
to make it clear</i>

33:56.065 --> 33:57.699
<i>That I am</i>

33:57.767 --> 34:00.535
<i>Firmly anti-laxative.</i>

34:00.603 --> 34:02.704
<i>- who the hell is this?</i>

34:04.507 --> 34:06.474
Teddy Chaough.

34:06.542 --> 34:09.476
Thanks for sticking my name
in there with the big boys.

34:09.545 --> 34:12.981
A full-page ad in "the times.
" what did that run you?

34:16.786 --> 34:18.853
A little mix-up there.
That was Eunice Kennedy.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.589
Keep joking.
You're cynical and craven.

34:21.657 --> 34:24.859
Tobacco put a roof
over your head

34:24.927 --> 34:27.495
- And it fed your children.
- And then it killed my business.

34:27.563 --> 34:31.065
I never thought you had the
stomach for a partnership.

34:31.132 --> 34:34.936
I'm no longer
a part of this agency.

34:35.004 --> 34:36.871
You there, get my shoes.

34:36.938 --> 34:38.505
Bert, calm down.

34:38.574 --> 34:40.141
I will not.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.010
We've created a monster.

34:50.418 --> 34:52.286
I've already informed
the other partners.

34:52.353 --> 34:56.391
I'll need your contribution by
close of business, as it were.

34:56.458 --> 34:57.726
You know this could work.

34:59.295 --> 35:02.464
Do you realize I've just
moved my family back here?

35:08.738 --> 35:10.905
I'm terribly sorry about that.

35:10.973 --> 35:14.242
- Did you get Dr. Miller?
- Yes, but you were on with...

35:14.310 --> 35:16.745
You were on the phone.
She said she'd stop by later.

35:18.247 --> 35:20.615
Okay, that'll be all.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.617
By the way,

35:22.685 --> 35:24.953
I loved the letter.

35:25.020 --> 35:27.122
I love that you stand
for something.

35:27.189 --> 35:29.491
Megan, that's not
really what it's about.

35:29.558 --> 35:32.560
I know that part.
I know it was about

35:32.628 --> 35:34.562
"he didn't dump me.
I dumped him."

35:36.632 --> 35:39.334
I just love that you did it.

35:39.401 --> 35:41.236
It feels different around here.

35:45.407 --> 35:46.775
Thank you.

35:53.849 --> 35:56.484
- So who else called?
- Everyone who's anyone.

35:56.552 --> 35:58.353
Smokey the bear,
Smokey Robinson,

35:58.420 --> 36:02.023
Chiquita banana, aunt Jemima.

36:02.091 --> 36:04.125
Is he gonna quit smoking?

36:04.193 --> 36:06.294
you're an idiot.

36:06.362 --> 36:07.929
I heard from all my
clients this morning...

36:07.997 --> 36:10.031
Mostly out of morbid curiosity.

36:10.099 --> 36:12.400
But one thing's for sure... they're not
talking about lucky strike anymore.

36:12.468 --> 36:15.036
Well, I think that was
the whole idea.

36:15.104 --> 36:17.672
They're gonna fire everybody...

36:17.740 --> 36:19.407
Or worse,
make me fire everybody.

36:19.475 --> 36:22.544
Well, it's been a pleasure
working with you all.

36:22.611 --> 36:24.179
I wish you the best of luck.

36:27.183 --> 36:30.051
I didn't think
they'd start with him.

36:30.119 --> 36:33.354
Peggy, Mr. Draper wants
to see you.

36:34.657 --> 36:36.257
Okay.

36:45.301 --> 36:48.269
It's a doggy-dog world.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.408
Should I close the door?

36:53.475 --> 36:54.809
Yes.

36:59.648 --> 37:00.882
Should I sit down?

37:02.084 --> 37:03.585
Who can you live without?

37:06.689 --> 37:07.989
Oh good.

37:08.057 --> 37:10.124
I mean not good,

37:10.192 --> 37:12.293
But... you know.

37:12.361 --> 37:15.330
Well, Danny obviously,

37:15.397 --> 37:16.965
Though he's kind of
grown on me.

37:17.032 --> 37:20.268
Lane sent over a memo
with suggestions.

37:20.336 --> 37:23.071
"all of the tobacco people,
mark Coyle,

37:23.138 --> 37:27.675
Wuzna"... the polish
kid... "Danny and bill."

37:30.546 --> 37:32.213
That's a lot of people.

37:33.415 --> 37:34.816
Are we going under?

37:34.884 --> 37:38.519
No. Of course not.

37:38.587 --> 37:40.355
I just wanted
to give you notice

37:40.422 --> 37:42.757
So when they all come to you,
you'll know what's going on.

37:44.260 --> 37:45.360
Okay.

37:47.630 --> 37:52.133
So? You haven't said
anything about the letter.

37:52.201 --> 37:55.536
I thought you didn't go in for
those kinds of shenanigans.

38:25.890 --> 38:27.624
Sally draper.

38:27.691 --> 38:29.426
Stop, both of you.

38:29.493 --> 38:31.127
What are you doing here?

38:36.400 --> 38:38.401
You stay away from her!
You hear me?

38:40.371 --> 38:42.305
Let's go.

38:50.848 --> 38:52.615
We're not going back
for your bike.

38:52.683 --> 38:55.318
I told you... he's my friend.
We don't do anything.

38:55.386 --> 38:58.354
- That boy is bad.
- No, he's not.

38:58.422 --> 39:01.524
Believe me.
I know him better than you do.

39:02.827 --> 39:04.394
You don't know him at all.

39:07.364 --> 39:08.731
Go to your room.

39:18.109 --> 39:22.045
- You stopped by. - Yes.
I'm glad to see you smiling.

39:22.113 --> 39:24.747
Well, they all want to kill
me, but I have a bodyguard.

39:24.815 --> 39:28.184
- Can I get you anything?
- No thank you.

39:37.862 --> 39:41.097
- What's this?
- My things.

39:41.165 --> 39:43.032
<i>- we had to resign.</i>

39:44.635 --> 39:47.270
Geoff atherton wants another
cigarette account someday.

39:49.974 --> 39:52.609
I'm so sorry.
I didn't think about that.

39:52.676 --> 39:54.410
I know.

39:59.383 --> 40:00.884
I'm really sorry.

40:09.226 --> 40:10.393
So...

40:11.996 --> 40:13.863
You're gonna make it
through this day,

40:13.931 --> 40:17.066
You're going to leave this
office, meet me for dinner

40:17.134 --> 40:19.869
In the open...
wherever I want...

40:19.937 --> 40:21.638
And we're gonna talk
about anything but work,

40:23.073 --> 40:25.175
Because we can do that now.

40:26.410 --> 40:28.478
It's a fair trade.

40:49.033 --> 40:51.334
Sure.

40:51.402 --> 40:53.570
Have your girl
make reservations.

41:06.016 --> 41:07.650
Just wanted to say goodbye.

41:09.153 --> 41:12.088
Oh no. What happened?

41:12.156 --> 41:14.791
Tobacco is very touchy.

41:14.858 --> 41:17.594
Who's gonna do our research?

41:17.661 --> 41:20.930
You know, I just lost
one of my best jobs.

41:20.998 --> 41:22.799
No, I mean,

41:24.301 --> 41:26.102
I love working with you.

41:26.170 --> 41:28.004
Would you have a drink with me?

41:29.506 --> 41:31.541
- I don't want to linger.
- Not right now.

41:31.609 --> 41:35.178
Just... I hate to think
I'm not gonna see you.

41:35.246 --> 41:37.380
That's sweet.

41:37.448 --> 41:39.148
No, I mean it.

41:39.216 --> 41:41.417
You do your job so well,

41:41.485 --> 41:44.554
They respect you and you don't
have to play any games.

41:46.023 --> 41:47.590
I didn't know
that was possible.

41:47.658 --> 41:49.692
Is that what it looks like?

41:51.829 --> 41:54.430
I'm sure we'll work
together again...

41:54.498 --> 41:56.299
Somewhere.

42:10.547 --> 42:11.881
Hello there.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.421
So I'm home early
for a family dinner.

42:18.489 --> 42:20.823
they couldn't wait.

42:20.891 --> 42:23.493
- We can eat later.
- I'll eat with this crowd.

42:31.902 --> 42:33.836
Well, I had quite a day.

42:33.904 --> 42:36.139
Mmm, that doesn't sound good.

42:36.206 --> 42:38.341
It's this neighborhood.

42:38.409 --> 42:41.044
It's being taken over
by low-caliber people.

42:44.648 --> 42:46.616
I think it's time
for us to move.

42:48.452 --> 42:51.788
Great. You know
how I feel about it.

42:51.855 --> 42:53.990
I like that place in rye.

42:54.058 --> 42:55.758
Rye? Isn't that
where playland is?

43:05.235 --> 43:07.136
She'll get over it.

43:32.629 --> 43:35.565
Roger, don, Harry and myself
should probably begin

43:35.632 --> 43:37.333
The process
of letting people go

43:37.401 --> 43:40.002
To avoid any further damage
to morale.

43:40.070 --> 43:42.739
And please try and limit
any sympathetic adjustments

43:42.806 --> 43:46.142
- To severance.
- Yes, and as lane mentioned,

43:46.210 --> 43:48.211
We'll try to hold onto
any staplers, scissors,

43:48.278 --> 43:50.012
Hole punches
and tape dispensers.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.981
They do disappear.

43:53.751 --> 43:54.951
Don, are you
ever gonna call back

43:55.018 --> 43:56.452
The American cancer society?

43:56.520 --> 43:57.787
They've tried you
twice this morning.

43:57.855 --> 44:00.723
I saw that.
It's a joke.

44:00.791 --> 44:02.925
It's not.
They finally called me.

44:02.993 --> 44:05.862
They want us to come in and meet
about an anti-smoking campaign.

44:05.929 --> 44:08.197
Huh. Really?

44:08.265 --> 44:10.566
Took me about five minutes
to stop laughing.

44:10.634 --> 44:12.335
I hope I didn't blow it.

44:13.804 --> 44:15.138
Well, that's interesting, right?

44:15.205 --> 44:18.674
Great. Public service.

44:18.742 --> 44:21.444
Free work. That's just what
we should be doing right now.

44:21.512 --> 44:24.380
- It's prestigious.
- But we can't eat prestige.

44:24.448 --> 44:26.048
Someone called us.

44:26.116 --> 44:28.117
We could have
new work on the air.

44:28.185 --> 44:29.819
There's a lot
of bigwigs on the board.

44:31.789 --> 44:34.791
Under normal circumstances, I would
consider this an opportunity.

44:34.858 --> 44:37.360
- Absolutely.
- Yes, don saved the company.

44:37.428 --> 44:39.796
Now go get rid of half of it.

44:43.667 --> 44:45.601
We should probably
stay in here.

44:45.669 --> 44:47.303
I suppose.

44:48.972 --> 44:51.140
Lane, may I speak
with you a moment?

44:51.208 --> 44:53.943
Well, I've gotta go learn a bunch of
people's names before I fire them.

45:00.984 --> 45:02.752
I know you said the end
of business today,

45:02.820 --> 45:05.555
But that money...
I don't have it.

45:05.622 --> 45:08.691
Is there any way
I can owe it on advance

45:08.759 --> 45:11.561
Against bonus or future salary?

45:11.628 --> 45:14.497
Calm yourself.
Don paid your share.

45:14.565 --> 45:16.165
What?

45:16.233 --> 45:18.835
Perhaps you weren't
supposed to know that.

46:05.115 --> 46:07.817
Well, thank you
for the opportunity.

46:07.885 --> 46:09.719
It was my pleasure.

46:17.027 --> 46:18.261
Bill.
