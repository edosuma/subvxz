NARRATOR:

00:01.794 --> 00:05.172
<i>All right, people, lots coming</i>

00:01.794 --> 00:05.172
<i>up. As you know, Michael died.</i>

00:05.172 --> 00:06.799
<i>And three years later, well,</i>

00:06.799 --> 00:09.259
<i>it was still really hard.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.386
<i>Also hard,</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.386
<i>Jane's nightmare boss, Chloe.</i>

00:11.386 --> 00:14.431
<i>But guess what?</i>

00:11.386 --> 00:14.431
<i>She just got some amazing news.</i>

00:14.431 --> 00:16.517
A publisher wants

00:14.431 --> 00:16.517
to buy my novel about Michael.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.893
NARRATOR:

00:16.517 --> 00:17.893
<i>Go, Jane!</i>

00:17.893 --> 00:19.394
( cheering )

00:17.893 --> 00:19.394
<i>And as for her parents,</i>

00:19.394 --> 00:22.147
<i>well, things were looking up</i>

00:19.394 --> 00:22.147
<i>for them, too.</i>

00:22.147 --> 00:24.692
<i>See, they'd been estranged</i>

00:22.147 --> 00:24.692
<i>for the past two years,</i>

00:24.692 --> 00:27.528
<i>because of how Xo was portrayed</i>

00:24.692 --> 00:27.528
<i>on Rogelio's reality show,</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.530
The De La Vega-Factor Factor.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.157
<i>That's right.</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:32.157
<i>She was known as the evil ex.</i>

00:32.157 --> 00:34.242
<i>But Rogelio convinced her</i>

00:32.157 --> 00:34.242
<i>he knew nothing about that.</i>

00:34.242 --> 00:36.578
<i>So they were trying</i>

00:34.242 --> 00:36.578
<i>to move past it.</i>

00:36.578 --> 00:40.207
<i>Also moving forward,</i>

00:36.578 --> 00:40.207
<i>Jane's baby daddy, Rafael.</i>

00:40.207 --> 00:42.877
<i>See, he went to prison</i>

00:40.207 --> 00:42.877
<i>and came back all Zen.</i>

00:42.877 --> 00:44.419
Just breathe.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.380
NARRATOR:

00:44.419 --> 00:46.380
<i>And he had</i>

00:44.419 --> 00:46.380
<i>a new girlfriend, Abbey,</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.173
<i>a super sweet</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.173
<i>greeting card designer.</i>

00:48.173 --> 00:50.509
<i>And as for</i>

00:48.173 --> 00:50.509
<i>his other baby mama, Petra,</i>

00:50.509 --> 00:52.720
<i>well, she had</i>

00:50.509 --> 00:52.720
<i>rebranded the Marbella</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:54.722
<i>and turned it</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:54.722
<i>into a kids' hotel.</i>

00:54.722 --> 00:57.558
<i>And she had a new beau, too:</i>

00:54.722 --> 00:57.558
<i>Chuck Chesser,</i>

00:57.558 --> 00:59.351
<i>the owner of</i>

00:57.558 --> 00:59.351
<i>the Fairwick Hotel next door.</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:02.103
<i>And she wanted to keep</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:02.103
<i>the relationship under wraps,</i>

01:02.103 --> 01:03.731
<i>but alas,</i>

01:03.731 --> 01:05.774
<i>nothing stays buried</i>

01:03.731 --> 01:05.774
<i>around here.</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:08.151
<i>Which is where we left off.</i>

01:11.906 --> 01:14.533
<i>Afterwards, after Michael,</i>

01:14.533 --> 01:18.704
<i>there were times when reality</i>

01:14.533 --> 01:18.704
<i>felt overwhelming and...</i>

01:18.704 --> 01:21.248
<i>well, let's have Jane tell us.</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:23.667
And my heart is racing,

01:23.667 --> 01:25.794
I'm sweating,

01:25.794 --> 01:29.423
everything looks

01:25.794 --> 01:29.423
and sounds far away.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.552
( sniffles ):

01:30.883 --> 01:33.552
It's like I'm dying.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.971
Yeah, that's definitely

01:33.552 --> 01:35.971
a panic attack.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.472
And I can give you some tools.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.559
Yes. Please, yes.

01:40.559 --> 01:41.936
First, take a deep breath,

01:41.936 --> 01:44.479
put your hand on your heart

01:41.936 --> 01:44.479
and give yourself

01:44.479 --> 01:45.731
a reality check.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.232
Remind yourself that

01:47.232 --> 01:48.817
you are not dying

01:48.817 --> 01:52.279
and that this is just a physical

01:48.817 --> 01:52.279
sensation that will pass.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.573
Then go through a checklist

01:52.279 --> 01:54.573
to figure out the trigger.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.408
HALT.

01:56.408 --> 02:01.455
Are you hungry, angry,

01:56.408 --> 02:01.455
lonely or tired?

02:01.455 --> 02:02.915
Usually all four.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.500
Try to figure out

02:02.915 --> 02:05.500
which is strongest,

02:05.500 --> 02:06.835
and then keep breathing.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.378
And when

02:06.835 --> 02:08.378
the panic attack passes,

02:08.378 --> 02:10.756
address the underlying trigger.

02:10.756 --> 02:13.759
Okay, I'll

02:10.756 --> 02:13.759
give it a try.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.476
I feel really bad,

02:19.139 --> 02:22.476
so terrible.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.685
Go on.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.980
I think I'm ready

02:23.685 --> 02:25.980
to stop therapy.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.523
NARRATOR:

02:25.980 --> 02:28.523
<i>Ah, the awkward</i>

02:25.980 --> 02:28.523
<i>therapy breakup.</i>

02:28.523 --> 02:30.025
<i>Who hasn't been there?</i>

02:30.025 --> 02:31.568
That's great, Jane.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.568
( sighs )

02:31.568 --> 02:33.320
It means we've made

02:31.568 --> 02:33.320
real progress.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.238
NARRATOR:

02:33.320 --> 02:35.238
<i>Hmm, mine was</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:35.238
<i>much more awkward.</i>

02:35.238 --> 02:36.907
You have been

02:35.238 --> 02:36.907
so helpful.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.909
NARRATOR:

02:36.907 --> 02:38.909
<i>Then again, I led</i>

02:36.907 --> 02:38.909
<i>with expensive.</i>

02:38.909 --> 02:41.036
And I will take everything

02:38.909 --> 02:41.036
I learned with me.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.664
NARRATOR:

02:41.036 --> 02:43.664
<i>Which she did, for the record.</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.709
<i>Especially</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.709
<i>that deep breathing technique.</i>

02:47.709 --> 02:50.087
CHLOE:

02:47.709 --> 02:50.087
Why did you

02:47.709 --> 02:50.087
cancel my therapist?

02:50.087 --> 02:51.338
Are you an idiot?

02:51.338 --> 02:52.840
NARRATOR:

02:51.338 --> 02:52.840
<i>Not for panic attacks,</i>

02:52.840 --> 02:54.215
<i>but for panic-inducing bosses.</i>

02:54.215 --> 02:55.843
I canceled

02:54.215 --> 02:55.843
your appointment because

02:55.843 --> 02:58.177
you texted me late last night

02:55.843 --> 02:58.177
asking me to cancel it.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.764
Well, you should have known

02:58.177 --> 03:00.764
that if I'm texting you

03:00.764 --> 03:02.724
late at night

03:00.764 --> 03:02.724
about my therapist,

03:02.724 --> 03:04.726
I really need my therapist.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.482
You're right. I'm sorry.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.109
NARRATOR:

03:10.482 --> 03:12.109
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>

03:12.109 --> 03:13.527
<i>Jane just got a book deal.</i>

03:13.527 --> 03:16.155
<i>Why is she still working</i>

03:13.527 --> 03:16.155
<i>for this demon?</i>

03:16.155 --> 03:17.906
And my latte is cold!

03:17.906 --> 03:19.158
( gasps )

03:19.158 --> 03:20.951
NARRATOR:

03:19.158 --> 03:20.951
<i>Well, at least it's cold.</i>

03:23.829 --> 03:26.540
<i>Screw it,</i>

03:23.829 --> 03:26.540
<i>I'm going to be optimistic!</i>

03:35.799 --> 03:38.343
I don't know how you don't quit

03:35.799 --> 03:38.343
that job 15 times a day.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.512
I haven't gotten the official

03:38.343 --> 03:40.512
offer for my book deal yet.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.222
I need to know

03:40.512 --> 03:42.222
what number I'm working with

03:42.222 --> 03:43.807
before I give them my notice.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.893
ABBEY:

03:43.807 --> 03:45.893
I think you're being

03:43.807 --> 03:45.893
completely reasonable.

03:45.893 --> 03:50.022
NARRATOR:

03:45.893 --> 03:50.022
<i>Oh, my bad. I actually</i>

03:45.893 --> 03:50.022
<i>forgot she was there.</i>

03:50.022 --> 03:52.649
Thanks, lady. See?

03:50.022 --> 03:52.649
No, do not gang up on me.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.359
( chuckles ):

03:52.649 --> 03:54.359
We're not. She's just right.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.444
Anyway, I got to run.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.444
My Something Borrowed,

03:56.444 --> 03:58.488
Something Blue line just came in

03:56.444 --> 03:58.488
Something Turquoise.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.241
NARRATOR:

03:58.488 --> 04:01.241
<i>Hey, what's wrong with</i>

03:58.488 --> 04:01.241
<i>turquoise? I love turquoise.</i>

04:01.241 --> 04:02.492
Love you.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.492
I love you.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.327
Mwah.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.164
<i>I know, right? They're already</i>

04:04.327 --> 04:07.164
<i>at "I love you."That's major.</i>

04:07.164 --> 04:08.832
MAN:

04:07.164 --> 04:08.832
We had a reservation.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.918
ELVIS:

04:08.832 --> 04:10.918
I know and I'm

04:08.832 --> 04:10.918
sorry, but we're backed up,

04:10.918 --> 04:12.211
and it's currently

04:10.918 --> 04:12.211
an hour wait.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.545
This is unacceptable.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.262
( quietly ):

04:20.052 --> 04:22.262
If you move

04:20.052 --> 04:22.262
the planters by the railing,

04:22.262 --> 04:23.638
you can push

04:22.262 --> 04:23.638
two tables together.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.891
Thank you.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.891
Mm-hmm.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.017
Enjoy.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.561
You are a lifesaver.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.561
He'll learn.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.771
I hope so.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.647
Scott was a creepy,

04:30.771 --> 04:32.647
scheming weirdo,

04:32.647 --> 04:34.816
but he was a damn good

04:32.647 --> 04:34.816
lounge manager.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.860
May he rest in peace.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.655
Speaking of which,

04:36.860 --> 04:40.655
don't you have to...?

04:40.655 --> 04:42.783
Yeah. I do.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.492
Good luck.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.578
NARRATOR:

04:44.492 --> 04:46.578
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

04:46.578 --> 04:47.996
<i>Good luck with what?</i>

04:47.996 --> 04:50.249
DENNIS:

04:47.996 --> 04:50.249
Okay, the results are in.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.042
We've concluded

04:50.249 --> 04:52.042
that Scott Archuletta's body

04:52.042 --> 04:53.794
was officially found

04:52.042 --> 04:53.794
on the grounds of...

04:53.794 --> 04:56.046
NARRATOR:

04:53.794 --> 04:56.046
<i>Actually, I should</i>

04:53.794 --> 04:56.046
<i>jump in real quick.</i>

04:56.046 --> 04:57.798
<i>That's Dennis.</i>

04:56.046 --> 04:57.798
<i>You remember Dennis, right?</i>

04:57.798 --> 05:00.383
<i>Michael's old BFF</i>

04:57.798 --> 05:00.383
<i>at the police department.</i>

05:00.383 --> 05:02.385
<i>He's been promoted to, like,</i>

05:02.385 --> 05:04.387
<i>major or admiral</i>

05:02.385 --> 05:04.387
<i>or colonel or something.</i>

05:04.387 --> 05:07.099
<i>Anyway, he's now running</i>

05:04.387 --> 05:07.099
<i>the dead Scott investigation.</i>

05:07.099 --> 05:08.809
<i>Okay, let's continue.</i>

05:08.809 --> 05:11.228
<i>Scott's body</i>

05:08.809 --> 05:11.228
<i>was on the grounds of...</i>

05:11.228 --> 05:13.021
...the Fairwick Hotel

05:13.021 --> 05:15.523
and not the Marbella.

05:15.523 --> 05:19.069
(<i> lively theme playing</i> )

05:19.069 --> 05:22.489
So, I got a stiff

05:19.069 --> 05:22.489
on my property. So what?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.116
Accidents happen.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.367
Problem is, we don't know

05:24.116 --> 05:26.367
if it's an accident yet.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.828
Could be a homicide.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.705
So that's what we have

05:27.828 --> 05:30.705
to try to figure out.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.791
PETRA:

05:30.705 --> 05:32.791
Chuck, wait!

05:33.750 --> 05:35.752
Hi.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.504
Couldn't resist

05:35.752 --> 05:37.504
a private good-bye, huh?

05:37.504 --> 05:40.299
Uh, no, I just, I wanted to

05:37.504 --> 05:40.299
see if you needed some advice.

05:40.299 --> 05:44.136
Since, you know, the

05:40.299 --> 05:44.136
Marbella's been here before.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.054
A few times.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.642
NARRATOR:

05:48.640 --> 05:50.642
<i>Hold on, that elderly guest</i>

05:50.642 --> 05:52.560
<i>died peacefully in his sleep.</i>

05:52.560 --> 05:54.313
What's your angle?

05:54.313 --> 05:55.647
What?

05:55.647 --> 05:58.066
Darlin', I've been

05:55.647 --> 05:58.066
in bed with you.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.068
You only think about yourself.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.321
NARRATOR:

06:00.068 --> 06:02.321
<i>Whoa. TMI, Chuck.</i>

06:02.321 --> 06:03.905
What are you trying

06:02.321 --> 06:03.905
to get me to do?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.657
Nothing. I'm trying to help you.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.784
Let's just stick to the language

06:05.657 --> 06:07.784
of love, sweetheart.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.703
And I'll take care

06:07.784 --> 06:09.703
of my own hotel.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.038
( elevator bell dings )

06:15.167 --> 06:17.044
Okay, so regardless of

06:15.167 --> 06:17.044
where Scott was found,

06:17.044 --> 06:18.712
we have to get out in

06:17.044 --> 06:18.712
front of the story.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.255
I'm implementing

06:18.712 --> 06:20.255
a complete lockdown.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.174
All media calls will be

06:20.255 --> 06:22.174
forwarded directly to me,

06:22.174 --> 06:24.301
the staff will inform guests

06:22.174 --> 06:24.301
that the blocked-off area

06:24.301 --> 06:26.094
on the beach is due

06:24.301 --> 06:26.094
to renovations,

06:26.094 --> 06:27.762
and security

06:26.094 --> 06:27.762
have been given strict orders

06:27.762 --> 06:29.223
to keep all press

06:27.762 --> 06:29.223
off the premises.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.849
But don't you think--

06:30.849 --> 06:32.684
This is a kids hotel.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.519
A whisper of murder

06:32.684 --> 06:34.519
and we're ruined.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.355
You are ruining me.

06:36.355 --> 06:39.482
Only the finest masseuses

06:36.355 --> 06:39.482
for my new bride.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.527
( moaning )

06:43.778 --> 06:47.115
Your hands feel

06:43.778 --> 06:47.115
so good on my body.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.783
( moans )

06:48.783 --> 06:51.370
That oil is so slippery

06:48.783 --> 06:51.370
and delicious.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.956
Can you rub it...even lower?

06:54.956 --> 06:58.501
Tanning oil does feel

06:54.956 --> 06:58.501
<i>so</i> good on the skin.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.003
TRIPP:

06:58.501 --> 07:00.003
Cut!

07:00.003 --> 07:03.257
Rogelio, this cabana boy

07:00.003 --> 07:03.257
is moving in on your woman

07:03.257 --> 07:05.967
on your romantic

07:03.257 --> 07:05.967
Hawaiian honeymoon!

07:10.430 --> 07:12.432
You're supposed to fly

07:10.430 --> 07:12.432
into a jealous rage

07:12.432 --> 07:14.851
and then hit her up

07:12.432 --> 07:14.851
with your catchphrase.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.895
"I just want to be factored in!"

07:16.895 --> 07:19.231
Yes, I know that's

07:16.895 --> 07:19.231
what I would have said,

07:19.231 --> 07:21.649
but, remember,

07:19.231 --> 07:21.649
this is a kinder, gentler

07:21.649 --> 07:23.902
<i>The De La Vega-Factor Factor.</i>

07:23.902 --> 07:25.279
No jealous rages.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.863
I just want to do

07:25.279 --> 07:26.863
a show about

07:26.863 --> 07:30.284
a happy, well-adjusted

07:26.863 --> 07:30.284
fake married couple.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.618
( phone vibrates )

07:42.712 --> 07:44.798
Okay. Dad'll be here soon.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.591
Great.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.551
I'm really glad

07:46.591 --> 07:48.551
we're doing this.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.678
NARRATOR:

07:48.551 --> 07:50.678
<i>Ah, yes, you'll</i>

07:48.551 --> 07:50.678
<i>recall, Xo and Ro</i>

07:50.678 --> 07:51.972
<i>put their fight behind them.</i>

07:51.972 --> 07:53.848
Me, too. It's about time.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.850
Come on,

07:53.848 --> 07:55.850
Mr. Sweetface.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.353
Your daddy's on his way

07:55.850 --> 07:58.353
to pick you up.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.819
Before we get started,

08:02.441 --> 08:05.819
I just wanted to say something.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.321
I'm so happy

08:07.321 --> 08:10.324
that we're all here together

08:07.321 --> 08:10.324
to share in this moment,

08:10.324 --> 08:13.743
when I show you what a liar

08:13.743 --> 08:15.162
Rogelio really is.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.205
<i>I'll go talk to her.</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:17.205
<i>We'll go again.</i>

08:17.205 --> 08:20.083
<i>Why? That was perfect.</i>

08:17.205 --> 08:20.083
<i>We'll make it</i>

08:20.083 --> 08:21.751
<i>seem like she lost it</i>

08:20.083 --> 08:21.751
<i>because of you and Darci.</i>

08:21.751 --> 08:23.962
<i>Come on, she just spilled</i>

08:21.751 --> 08:23.962
<i>coffee on herself.</i>

08:23.962 --> 08:25.797
<i>America doesn't know that.</i>

08:25.797 --> 08:28.800
<i>Ro, buddy, this is the drama</i>

08:25.797 --> 08:28.800
<i>that we have been looking for.</i>

08:28.800 --> 08:31.178
<i>It's gonna send the ratings</i>

08:28.800 --> 08:31.178
<i>through the roof.</i>

08:33.596 --> 08:35.974
<i>Fine. Just this once.</i>

08:38.226 --> 08:41.562
You said you didn't know

08:38.226 --> 08:41.562
anything about it.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.231
I knew you were lying!

08:43.231 --> 08:45.400
( in Spanish ):

08:43.231 --> 08:45.400
You lied to all of us.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.277
ROGELIO ( in English ):

08:45.400 --> 08:47.277
I know.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.321
I'm so, so sorry.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.323
I didn't think it would become

08:51.323 --> 08:53.116
such a big deal.

08:53.116 --> 08:56.328
I would--

08:53.116 --> 08:56.328
Go!

08:56.328 --> 08:58.079
Xiomara...

08:58.079 --> 08:59.956
Just go now.

09:11.592 --> 09:16.264
NARRATOR:

09:11.592 --> 09:16.264
<i>Wow, this Rogelio thing is</i>

09:11.592 --> 09:16.264
<i>really affecting her, huh?</i>

09:16.264 --> 09:18.350
<i>Oh, no, this is bad.</i>

09:16.264 --> 09:18.350
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>

09:18.350 --> 09:20.101
<i>"Wait, doesn't Jane</i>

09:18.350 --> 09:20.101
<i>like Dennis just fine?"</i>

09:20.101 --> 09:21.895
<i>Well, the answer is no,</i>

09:20.101 --> 09:21.895
<i>but I don't have time</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:23.480
<i>to explain now. Just trust me.</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:23.480
MAN: Jane?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.357
<i>She hasn't had</i>

09:23.480 --> 09:25.357
<i>a panic attack in forever.</i>

09:25.357 --> 09:27.025
Jane?

09:25.357 --> 09:27.025
<i>Remember your coping</i>

09:27.025 --> 09:29.277
<i>mechanisms, Jane.</i>

09:27.025 --> 09:29.277
( panting )

09:36.535 --> 09:38.995
Jane?

09:36.535 --> 09:38.995
( grunts )

09:38.995 --> 09:41.998
NARRATOR:

09:38.995 --> 09:41.998
<i>Wow. Even I didn't</i>

09:38.995 --> 09:41.998
<i>see that coming.</i>

09:45.168 --> 09:48.505
Oh, my God. I'm so...

09:45.168 --> 09:48.505
No, um...

09:48.505 --> 09:51.216
I-It's okay.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.216
But you deserved it. So sorry.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.301
Look, can we talk?

09:51.216 --> 09:53.301
No.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.553
Jane, we--

09:53.301 --> 09:54.553
I don't want

09:54.553 --> 09:57.180
to talk to you<i> ever.</i>

09:58.473 --> 10:00.016
( panting )

10:06.814 --> 10:10.151
I still can't believe it.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.238
( sniffles ):

10:10.151 --> 10:13.238
I know.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.367
( crying )

10:17.367 --> 10:19.578
I'm gonna check up on you, okay?

10:19.578 --> 10:21.121
( sniffles )

10:21.121 --> 10:22.622
ALBA ( in Spanish ):

10:21.121 --> 10:22.622
<i>You slapped him?</i>

10:22.622 --> 10:25.708
( in English ):

10:22.622 --> 10:25.708
I know. It's just...

10:25.708 --> 10:28.545
Ah. I started

10:25.708 --> 10:28.545
having a panic attack.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.796
( in Spanish ):

10:28.545 --> 10:29.796
Ah. You did?

10:29.796 --> 10:33.174
But you haven't had one

10:29.796 --> 10:33.174
in so long.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.594
( in English ):

10:33.174 --> 10:35.594
I was thrown. I wasn't

10:33.174 --> 10:35.594
expecting to see him.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.512
( in Spanish ):

10:35.594 --> 10:37.512
Why was he there?

10:37.512 --> 10:40.181
( in English ):

10:37.512 --> 10:40.181
Apparently, he's running

10:37.512 --> 10:40.181
the Scott investigation

10:40.181 --> 10:42.225
at the hotel, so he has to

10:40.181 --> 10:42.225
interview all the employees,

10:42.225 --> 10:43.768
including you<i> and</i> me.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.353
( in Spanish ):

10:43.768 --> 10:45.353
Want me to slap him?

10:45.353 --> 10:47.481
( in English) :

10:45.353 --> 10:47.481
I'll be fine.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.275
I just wasn't prepared.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.275
Now I'm prepared.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.528
No.A salad lead time of

10:50.275 --> 10:53.528
11 minutes is unacceptable.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.323
All salads and cold apps need

10:53.528 --> 10:56.323
to be delivered to the table

10:56.323 --> 10:58.241
within six minutes

10:56.323 --> 10:58.241
of the order being placed.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.659
I understand. I'm sorry.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.245
It won't happen again.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.414
Hey, yesterday

11:02.245 --> 11:04.414
it was 15 minutes.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.124
So he's improving.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.710
I am getting so tired

11:06.124 --> 11:09.710
of Zen Rafael.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.796
You hired him, you fire him.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.548
( phone chimes )

11:15.800 --> 11:17.552
Oh, no.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.221
Someone leaked the story.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.348
I hate to say I told you so.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.723
NARRATOR:

11:21.348 --> 11:22.723
<i>And yet...</i>

11:22.723 --> 11:24.225
We should've gotten

11:22.723 --> 11:24.225
ahead of it.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.894
All it takes is

11:24.225 --> 11:26.894
one disgruntled employee.

11:26.894 --> 11:30.190
( whispers ):

11:26.894 --> 11:30.190
And trust me,

11:26.894 --> 11:30.190
we have more than one.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.984
SONIA:

11:31.483 --> 11:32.984
So, so sorry

11:32.984 --> 11:34.902
for the wait.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.406
Great. You told me so.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.406
That's not important.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.158
What do we do now?

11:42.494 --> 11:45.455
I know this doesn't

11:42.494 --> 11:45.455
undo what I did,

11:45.455 --> 11:48.416
but please accept

11:45.455 --> 11:48.416
my apologies.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.044
I had my assistant go

11:48.416 --> 11:51.044
nuts at the bookstore.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.795
There are books

11:51.044 --> 11:52.795
about writing books,

11:52.795 --> 11:54.172
books about

11:52.795 --> 11:54.172
reading books--

11:54.172 --> 11:56.383
Dad, I appreciate

11:54.172 --> 11:56.383
all the books, but--

11:56.383 --> 11:57.592
Even books about forgiving.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.511
"Forgiveness

11:57.592 --> 11:59.511
is a gift

11:59.511 --> 12:01.095
you give yourself."

12:01.095 --> 12:02.930
Deepak Chopra.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.099
Via Suzanne Somers.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.060
Look, I know

12:05.099 --> 12:07.060
that you're sorry, but--

12:07.060 --> 12:08.687
I never meant

12:07.060 --> 12:08.687
to hurt anyone.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.188
But you did.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.399
And it's gonna take a while

12:10.188 --> 12:12.399
for people to forgive you

12:12.399 --> 12:13.900
no matter

12:12.399 --> 12:13.900
how many books you buy.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.276
I understand.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.945
I'm just trying

12:15.276 --> 12:17.945
to get the process started.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.532
Because I love you, Jane.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.532
You know that.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.992
And I love you, too.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.081
But I-I don't think

12:25.119 --> 12:28.081
Mom's gonna get past this.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.543
Her Ropology basket

12:28.081 --> 12:31.543
is a work of art.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.002
( phone chimes )

12:33.002 --> 12:34.921
Oh, my God. It's my offer

12:33.002 --> 12:34.921
from the publisher.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.506
NARRATOR:

12:34.921 --> 12:36.506
<i>I'm so excited!</i>

12:36.506 --> 12:38.383
<i>Let's see how much money</i>

12:36.506 --> 12:38.383
<i>Jane's going to get.</i>

12:38.383 --> 12:39.676
( shrieks )

12:39.676 --> 12:43.054
I am getting $50,000!

12:43.054 --> 12:44.472
What? That's it?

12:44.472 --> 12:47.058
( chuckles ):

12:44.472 --> 12:47.058
That's barely my episodic rate.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.312
No, that's amazing.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.312
$50,000 is a lot of money.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.231
It's a huge amount of money.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.231
What was I thinking?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.815
Let me get that scene

12:53.231 --> 12:54.815
from the top.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.945
$50,000, Jane! Holy moly!

12:58.945 --> 13:00.739
Congratulations!

13:00.739 --> 13:02.198
Oh. Ha.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.117
It's a year's salary.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.328
So I can finally give

13:04.117 --> 13:07.328
my two-week notice to Chloe.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.414
NARRATOR:

13:07.328 --> 13:09.414
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

13:09.414 --> 13:11.458
<i>Someone's got</i>

13:09.414 --> 13:11.458
<i>her quittin' heels on.</i>

13:17.589 --> 13:20.341
I have had it with Chloe

13:17.589 --> 13:20.341
and her ridiculous notes.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.260
I am not a hack, Jane!

13:22.260 --> 13:24.387
No one said you are, Gary.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.387
You know Chloe.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.514
You just got to breathe

13:24.387 --> 13:26.514
through it.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.142
( inhales, exhales ):

13:26.514 --> 13:29.142
Ah...

13:29.142 --> 13:32.312
We'll talk later, okay?

13:32.312 --> 13:35.231
NARRATOR:

13:32.312 --> 13:35.231
<i>Or hashtag</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:35.231
<i>"someone else's problem."</i>

13:37.150 --> 13:39.694
So, I have some exciting news.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.362
After the writers'

13:39.694 --> 13:41.362
showcase,

13:41.362 --> 13:43.364
I was actually offered

13:41.362 --> 13:43.364
a book deal.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.699
And?

13:45.659 --> 13:46.951
And...

13:46.951 --> 13:48.453
yay!

13:51.581 --> 13:54.083
So I'm giving

13:51.581 --> 13:54.083
my two-week notice.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.880
And I wanted to say thank you

13:56.169 --> 13:59.880
for the wonderful opportunity.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.008
It was amazing.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.263
So thank you.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.517
Very, very, very much.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.768
No.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.728
Two weeks' notice

14:11.768 --> 14:13.728
is unacceptable.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.022
I need at least six months,

14:13.728 --> 14:16.022
preferably a year,

14:16.022 --> 14:17.856
to find and train

14:16.022 --> 14:17.856
a new assistant.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.818
( stammers )

14:19.818 --> 14:22.654
T-Two weeks' notice is

14:19.818 --> 14:22.654
pretty much industry standard.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.448
Now you're lecturing me

14:22.654 --> 14:25.448
on industry standard?

14:25.448 --> 14:26.658
No. God, never. No.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.909
Uh... I could stay

14:26.658 --> 14:28.909
a little longer.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.078
( groans ):

14:28.909 --> 14:31.078
Oh, please.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.456
Go. You were terrible

14:31.078 --> 14:33.456
at your job.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.666
What?

14:34.666 --> 14:36.167
And you're

14:34.666 --> 14:36.167
deluding yourself

14:36.167 --> 14:38.044
if you think this book

14:36.167 --> 14:38.044
deal's going anywhere,

14:38.044 --> 14:40.714
especially with that

14:38.044 --> 14:40.714
ridiculous D-list publisher.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.174
But congrats, you're

14:40.714 --> 14:43.174
a half a step above

14:43.174 --> 14:44.509
self-publishing online.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.262
Wow.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.097
Chloe...

14:50.097 --> 14:52.141
you're a horrible person.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.310
And I tried

14:54.310 --> 14:56.521
to make excuses for you

14:54.310 --> 14:56.521
over the years,

14:56.521 --> 14:58.314
like maybe your parents

14:56.521 --> 14:58.314
didn't hug you,

14:58.314 --> 15:00.650
or maybe you grew up

14:58.314 --> 15:00.650
in a prison like Bane

15:00.650 --> 15:02.527
from that Batman movie,

15:00.650 --> 15:02.527
but I just think

15:02.527 --> 15:06.656
it comes down to who you are:

15:02.527 --> 15:06.656
a petty, mean-spirited bitch!

15:06.656 --> 15:08.115
NARRATOR:

15:06.656 --> 15:08.115
<i>Atta girl, Jane.</i>

15:08.115 --> 15:09.659
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

15:09.659 --> 15:11.536
<i>She deserved that.</i>

15:11.536 --> 15:14.121
God knows

15:11.536 --> 15:14.121
Scott did not deserve this.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.499
And I am so sad about this.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.042
( sobs softly )

15:18.042 --> 15:20.211
Which is why...

15:20.211 --> 15:22.213
we're dedicating

15:20.211 --> 15:22.213
this fountain to him,

15:22.213 --> 15:24.173
and creating a scholarship fund

15:22.213 --> 15:24.173
in his name

15:24.173 --> 15:25.341
for disadvantaged youth.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.885
( sighs ):

15:25.341 --> 15:26.885
And even though

15:26.885 --> 15:30.388
he died next-door,

15:26.885 --> 15:30.388
and not here at

15:30.388 --> 15:32.515
his beloved Marbella,

15:32.515 --> 15:35.393
his tragic loss will reverberate

15:32.515 --> 15:35.393
through these halls

15:35.393 --> 15:37.270
for years to come.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.400
Farewell, my friend.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.651
Farewell.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.027
( applause )

15:49.282 --> 15:50.533
Just know I feel terrible.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.910
VAN:

15:50.533 --> 15:51.910
<i>You should.</i>

15:51.910 --> 15:53.745
It's like North Korea here.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.705
Everyone's scared to say

15:53.745 --> 15:55.705
anything to Kim Jong-Chloe.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.457
<i>She told me to figure out</i>

15:55.705 --> 15:57.457
<i>everything you knew</i>

15:57.457 --> 15:58.999
<i>but not to call you.</i>

15:58.999 --> 16:00.877
If I get caught--

15:58.999 --> 16:00.877
<i>Don't worry, it sounds like she</i>

16:00.877 --> 16:02.462
wants you to call me

16:00.877 --> 16:02.462
but doesn't want you

16:02.462 --> 16:03.838
to know

16:02.462 --> 16:03.838
she wants you to call me.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.590
You're fine. And you've got...

16:05.590 --> 16:07.634
15 more minutes before

16:05.590 --> 16:07.634
she gets back from therapy,

16:07.634 --> 16:09.135
so hit me up.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.470
Sweat and Spin password?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.263
Zero-three-ten.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.263
BlowoutHeaven stylist?

16:12.263 --> 16:13.598
Lana for Beachy Waves,

16:13.598 --> 16:14.891
Quentin if she wants

16:13.598 --> 16:14.891
a Straight-Up,

16:14.891 --> 16:16.476
<i>and always</i>

16:14.891 --> 16:16.476
<i>with a scalp massage.</i>

16:16.476 --> 16:18.311
<i>Always</i> with a scalp massage.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.311
VAN: Got it.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.854
Coffee order?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.854
JANE: For a cold brew,

16:19.854 --> 16:21.355
Davey's 20-ounce Baridi Blend.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.816
For tea, InstaJava Venti

16:22.816 --> 16:24.484
<i>Iced Green Latte.</i>

16:22.816 --> 16:24.484
<i>And don't leave there</i>

16:24.484 --> 16:26.402
without an Edamame Hummus Wrap.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.402
She'll say that

16:26.402 --> 16:28.822
<i>she doesn't want one, but</i>

16:26.402 --> 16:28.822
<i>she'll always ask for it later.</i>

16:28.822 --> 16:30.281
( knocking )

16:28.822 --> 16:30.281
Hang on.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.950
Hurry.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.950
JANE: You're good on time.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.701
Legal docs for

16:31.950 --> 16:33.701
Jane Villanueva.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.912
Van, it's a messenger

16:33.701 --> 16:35.912
with documents

16:35.912 --> 16:38.665
from the publishing house

16:35.912 --> 16:38.665
for me to sign.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.916
Shut up. Oh, my God!

16:39.916 --> 16:42.084
<i>Chloe's favorite</i>

16:39.916 --> 16:42.084
<i>massage therapist?</i>

16:42.084 --> 16:43.795
She wants something

16:42.084 --> 16:43.795
called the pounder?

16:43.795 --> 16:45.546
Oh, no.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.546
VAN: Yep.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.256
Did I mention

16:45.546 --> 16:47.256
Gary finally dropped us?

16:47.256 --> 16:49.634
He's taking his next book

16:47.256 --> 16:49.634
to HarperCollins.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.344
Uh, 90 minutes with Mary.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.220
Van, let me call you back.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.973
( in Spanish ):

16:53.220 --> 16:54.973
What's wrong?

16:54.973 --> 16:56.975
( in English ):

16:54.973 --> 16:56.975
I-It's about when

16:54.973 --> 16:56.975
I get paid for my novel.

16:56.975 --> 17:01.270
NARRATOR:

16:56.975 --> 17:01.270
<i>And that's when Jane</i>

16:56.975 --> 17:01.270
<i>finally got her check.</i>

17:01.270 --> 17:04.524
I don't get $50,000

17:01.270 --> 17:04.524
all at once.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.900
I get $5,000 now,

17:05.900 --> 17:07.944
another five

17:05.900 --> 17:07.944
when I turn in my first draft,

17:07.944 --> 17:11.698
and the rest after

17:07.944 --> 17:11.698
the book is published.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.283
Holy crap! I just quit my job.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.703
I need to get my job back!

17:20.206 --> 17:22.500
( groans ):

17:20.206 --> 17:22.500
Of course I need to get it back.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.168
Why? You hate

17:22.500 --> 17:24.168
that job.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.420
ABBEY:

17:24.168 --> 17:26.420
You<i> have</i> been

17:24.168 --> 17:26.420
complaining about it forever.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.964
NARRATOR:

17:26.420 --> 17:27.964
<i>Oops. Sorry. My bad again.</i>

17:27.964 --> 17:29.256
Maybe this could be

17:27.964 --> 17:29.256
a good thing.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.591
It's just that

17:29.256 --> 17:30.591
publishing jobs

17:30.591 --> 17:32.760
are so hard to find,

17:30.591 --> 17:32.760
especially in Miami.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.471
And I know Chloe hasn't

17:32.760 --> 17:35.471
filled my position yet.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.806
Here's a thought.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.516
Our new lounge manager

17:36.806 --> 17:38.516
isn't working out.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.894
You could replace him.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.894
Oh... God, no.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.688
Why not?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.688
I left waitressing behind.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.481
This isn't waitressing,

17:43.688 --> 17:45.481
this is management.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.191
This is a step up

17:45.481 --> 17:47.191
in responsibility and pay.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.069
A wrong step.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.069
A step backwards, or sideways.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.365
Mateo, use your words.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.158
Help me!

17:56.158 --> 17:57.493
Please.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.620
Please!

17:59.620 --> 18:04.166
I just need to do some intense

17:59.620 --> 18:04.166
groveling, and...hope it works.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.794
Okay, the basket's

18:04.166 --> 18:06.794
all done.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.880
NARRATOR:

18:06.794 --> 18:08.880
<i>Aw. Jane's first</i>

18:06.794 --> 18:08.880
<i>apology basket.</i>

18:08.880 --> 18:10.715
<i>Let's see what</i>

18:08.880 --> 18:10.715
<i>she's giving Chloe.</i>

18:13.634 --> 18:14.928
What do you think?

18:14.928 --> 18:16.679
NARRATOR:

18:14.928 --> 18:16.679
<i>Not bad for a first-timer.</i>

18:16.679 --> 18:18.806
( in Spanish ):

18:16.679 --> 18:18.806
Why are my earrings

18:16.679 --> 18:18.806
in the basket?

18:18.806 --> 18:21.100
( in English ):

18:18.806 --> 18:21.100
Chloe loves vintage jewelry.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.352
( in Spanish ):

18:21.100 --> 18:23.352
She can love someone else's.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.358
( phone vibrates )

18:30.359 --> 18:32.028
( breathes deeply )

18:32.028 --> 18:33.863
You okay?

18:33.863 --> 18:35.448
( in English):

18:33.863 --> 18:35.448
Yeah.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.117
My interview with Dennis

18:35.448 --> 18:38.117
is scheduled for tomorrow.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.869
( sighs )

18:42.246 --> 18:43.790
NARRATOR:

18:42.246 --> 18:43.790
<i>As it happens, friends,</i>

18:43.790 --> 18:45.917
<i>Dennis did stop by</i>

18:43.790 --> 18:45.917
<i>to check on Jane.</i>

18:45.917 --> 18:47.627
Did you go to the pickup game?

18:45.917 --> 18:47.627
Yeah.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.212
NARRATOR:

18:47.627 --> 18:50.212
<i>And it turned</i>

18:47.627 --> 18:50.212
<i>into a regular thing.</i>

18:50.212 --> 18:51.965
Stayed five minutes,

18:50.212 --> 18:51.965
then I left.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.173
Why?

18:53.173 --> 18:54.842
Some guy asked

18:53.173 --> 18:54.842
where The Gunner was.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.218
The Gunner?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.218
Mm-hmm.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.054
That was Michael's

18:56.218 --> 18:58.054
nickname on the court.

18:58.054 --> 19:01.057
Because he was

18:58.054 --> 19:01.057
always gunning.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.391
The dude would never pass.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.936
( chuckles )

19:02.391 --> 19:04.936
Seriously?

19:04.936 --> 19:06.646
I didn't know Michael

19:04.936 --> 19:06.646
was such a ball hog.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.024
Oh, yeah. He made a lot,

19:06.646 --> 19:10.024
and he missed a<i> lot.</i>

19:10.024 --> 19:11.985
But he just kept shooting.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.028
( chuckles )

19:15.989 --> 19:17.281
So...

19:17.281 --> 19:19.993
you ready to go

19:17.281 --> 19:19.993
through his things?

19:19.993 --> 19:21.285
( exhales )

19:21.285 --> 19:22.745
( softly) :

19:21.285 --> 19:22.745
Yeah.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.124
And thank you

19:24.038 --> 19:26.124
for being here for this.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.541
Of course.

19:27.541 --> 19:31.087
( in Spanish ):

19:27.541 --> 19:31.087
Just breathe, my love, breathe.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.006
( exhales )

19:33.006 --> 19:35.508
( in English ):

19:33.006 --> 19:35.508
I just have to get through

19:33.006 --> 19:35.508
this stupid interview.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.301
RAFAEL:

19:35.508 --> 19:37.301
<i>Just breathe.</i>

19:37.301 --> 19:39.679
Don't tell me

19:37.301 --> 19:39.679
to breathe, Rafael.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.473
My breathing is not the problem.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.473
The problem is Elvis.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.018
The demotion didn't work.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.018
He's also a horrible waiter.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.020
If you won't

19:45.018 --> 19:47.020
fire him, I will.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.980
No, don't. You can't.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.858
I'll find

19:50.272 --> 19:51.858
some other place for him.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.943
Why do you care so much?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.570
I just...do.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.781
That's all.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.200
Okay. Fine.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.577
Look, I...met Elvis in prison.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.872
Oh, my God. Prison?

20:03.577 --> 20:05.872
Don't freak out.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.790
It was a nonviolent crime.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.790
Oh, you-you hired...

20:07.790 --> 20:09.249
He's a good guy.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.249
He just needs a chance.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.710
...an ex-con

20:09.249 --> 20:10.710
to work in a kids' hotel?

20:10.710 --> 20:13.171
Why? Why do we have

20:10.710 --> 20:13.171
to give him a chance?

20:13.171 --> 20:15.131
Because it's really tough

20:13.171 --> 20:15.131
for ex-cons to get work.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.133
And he has

20:15.131 --> 20:17.133
restaurant experience.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.551
I was just trying

20:17.133 --> 20:18.551
to do a good thing.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.386
If it makes you feel better,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.386
I'll just put him

20:20.386 --> 20:23.723
in maintenance, okay,

20:20.386 --> 20:23.723
away from the kids and the cash.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.350
Fine. Maintenance.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.894
And I'm running

20:26.350 --> 20:27.894
a background check.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.479
( phones vibrate, chime )

20:30.479 --> 20:33.649
Oh, my God, it worked.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.649
Your plan actually worked.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.818
"High praise to the

20:33.649 --> 20:35.818
owners of the Marbella

20:35.818 --> 20:37.277

20:37.277 --> 20:39.530

Could the Fairwick

20:49.790 --> 20:52.585
be covering something?"

20:54.628 --> 20:58.049
I lied, and I covered it up,

20:54.628 --> 20:58.049
and I'm just so sorry,

20:58.049 --> 21:00.718
but, Xo, please,

20:58.049 --> 21:00.718
just call me back.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.803
( sighs )

21:02.803 --> 21:04.972
You! I know what you did!

21:04.972 --> 21:06.640
What are you

21:04.972 --> 21:06.640
talking about?

21:06.640 --> 21:09.185
You sent that video to Xo,

21:06.640 --> 21:09.185
and now our relationship

21:09.185 --> 21:10.477
is ruined!

21:10.477 --> 21:12.063
I don't know anything

21:10.477 --> 21:12.063
about a video.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.732
You're a liar! I should

21:12.063 --> 21:14.732
have never trusted you!

21:14.732 --> 21:18.111
I didn't do it, Rogelio,

21:14.732 --> 21:18.111
I swear!

21:18.111 --> 21:19.987
It was probably Tripp.

21:19.987 --> 21:23.657
Come on. You said the only way

21:19.987 --> 21:23.657
you'd keep doing the show is

21:23.657 --> 21:25.659
if we made it

21:23.657 --> 21:25.659
kinder and gentler.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.162
And I agreed,

21:25.659 --> 21:28.162
because I need you.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.167
It wasn't me, I promise.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.004
Okay.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.006
Okay?

21:39.006 --> 21:41.383
Now can we deal

21:39.006 --> 21:41.383
with this after

21:41.383 --> 21:43.052
and get this scene shot?

21:44.595 --> 21:46.722
All right,

21:44.595 --> 21:46.722
let's do this!

21:46.722 --> 21:48.057
And action!

21:49.100 --> 21:52.019
Close your eyes, my love.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.772
I made it myself.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.356
( gasps )

21:56.356 --> 21:58.734
It's my apology for being

21:56.356 --> 21:58.734
jealous of the cabana boy.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.945
I'm sorry.

22:00.945 --> 22:04.198
NARRATOR:

22:00.945 --> 22:04.198
<i>And speaking of apologies...</i>

22:04.198 --> 22:05.866
<i>looks like Jane's got</i>

22:05.866 --> 22:08.327
<i>her "please give me</i>

22:05.866 --> 22:08.327
<i>my job back" heels on.</i>

22:09.578 --> 22:11.872
Oh, what are

22:09.578 --> 22:11.872
you doing here?

22:11.872 --> 22:14.333
Please. I just want

22:11.872 --> 22:14.333
to talk to you.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.002
And Van told me that you

22:14.333 --> 22:16.002
threw out my basket.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.337
NARRATOR:

22:16.002 --> 22:18.337
<i>Good thing</i>

22:16.002 --> 22:18.337
<i>Alba kept her earrings.</i>

22:18.337 --> 22:21.465
And since you won't

22:18.337 --> 22:21.465
let me past reception,

22:21.465 --> 22:24.051
and I know your

22:21.465 --> 22:24.051
schedule, I...

22:24.051 --> 22:26.386
Geez, you have to have, like,

22:24.051 --> 22:26.386
an engineering degree

22:26.386 --> 22:27.930
to get this...up.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.932
I got it. Ha.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.101
Look, Chloe...

22:32.101 --> 22:34.520
I just want to say

22:32.101 --> 22:34.520
that I am so sorry

22:34.520 --> 22:36.522
that I quit, and I...

22:34.520 --> 22:36.522
( loud dance music begins )

22:36.522 --> 22:39.025
Okay. Are you ready to be

22:36.522 --> 22:39.025
your best self today?

22:39.025 --> 22:42.528
Let's make every minute count.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.528
Out of the saddle!

22:42.528 --> 22:44.738
( dance music continues

22:42.528 --> 22:44.738
playing over speakers )

22:49.785 --> 22:53.164
We're almost at the crest

22:49.785 --> 22:53.164
of Mount Fuji, people!

22:58.294 --> 23:00.838
You're almost there!

22:58.294 --> 23:00.838
You own this mountain!

23:00.838 --> 23:02.631
Today is your day!

23:00.838 --> 23:02.631
( inaudible under loud music )

23:02.631 --> 23:05.301
NARRATOR:

23:02.631 --> 23:05.301
<i>I know! I can't</i>

23:02.631 --> 23:05.301
<i>hear her, either.</i>

23:05.301 --> 23:07.678
<i>I assume she's apologizing.</i>

23:05.301 --> 23:07.678
<i>Or hyperventilating.</i>

23:07.678 --> 23:09.305
INSTRUCTOR:

23:07.678 --> 23:09.305
Whoo!

23:09.305 --> 23:12.390
You made it to the top.

23:09.305 --> 23:12.390
Now break away from the pack.

23:12.390 --> 23:14.227
( groans )

23:14.227 --> 23:15.561
( music stops )

23:14.227 --> 23:15.561
Wow.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.355
That was intense.

23:17.355 --> 23:21.192
Do they provide a wheelchair,

23:17.355 --> 23:21.192
or do you just crawl out?

23:21.192 --> 23:24.737
Chloe... please,

23:21.192 --> 23:24.737
can we talk?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.197
Just wait.

23:26.197 --> 23:27.531
No, just give me a second!

23:27.531 --> 23:29.158
( groans ):

23:27.531 --> 23:29.158
Okay.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.408
( grunts )

23:30.408 --> 23:32.745
Are you kidding me right now?

23:32.745 --> 23:34.121
( grunts )

23:34.121 --> 23:35.373
Wait!

23:35.373 --> 23:37.415
( panting ):

23:35.373 --> 23:37.415
Chloe!

23:37.415 --> 23:38.751
Wait. I know I was rash.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.336
I got caught up

23:38.751 --> 23:40.336
in the excitement

23:40.336 --> 23:42.963
of getting a book deal,

23:40.336 --> 23:42.963
and I shouldn't have quit.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.799
But I know you haven't found a

23:42.963 --> 23:45.799
replacement, and let's face it,

23:45.799 --> 23:48.261
no one knows you

23:45.799 --> 23:48.261
better than I do. Please.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.845
No.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.430
I can get Gary back.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.766
I'm listening.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.601
I know him. He trusts me.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.436
Remember, I got him to add

23:55.601 --> 23:58.436
commas into<i> The Golden Hour,</i>

23:58.436 --> 24:00.189
even though

23:58.436 --> 24:00.189
he's morally opposed to commas?

24:00.189 --> 24:03.109
And you yourself said

24:00.189 --> 24:03.109
that it made the book readable.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.610
Just give me a chance.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.695
Hey, what do you have to lose?

24:06.695 --> 24:10.532
Fine. If you can get Gary back,

24:06.695 --> 24:10.532
you can have your job back.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.078
( car door closes )

24:19.417 --> 24:22.753
Hey, Gary, I was hoping

24:19.417 --> 24:22.753
that we could meet for a drink.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.256
And, look, I know that

24:22.753 --> 24:25.256
you already made your decision,

24:25.256 --> 24:27.925
but I just wanted to talk to you

24:25.256 --> 24:27.925
about it, okay?

24:27.925 --> 24:30.428
Uh, call me back.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.513
NARRATOR:

24:31.887 --> 24:33.513
<i>Deep breaths, Jane.</i>

24:33.513 --> 24:35.433
<i>I've been doing it, too,</i>

<i>and I am definitely</i>

How's Lindsay?

24:43.274 --> 24:44.817
<i>That's his fiancée.</i>

<i>She's a third-year resident</i>

24:51.240 --> 24:52.699
She's fine. Busy with work.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.077
Thanks for asking.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.536
About what happened

24:55.077 --> 24:56.536
the other day...

24:56.536 --> 24:58.831
I just want to get

24:56.536 --> 24:58.831
this over with.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.959
So, what kind of guy was Scott?

24:58.831 --> 25:01.959
Did you like him?

25:01.959 --> 25:04.670
Was he trustworthy?

25:01.959 --> 25:04.670
( pen clicks )

25:06.880 --> 25:08.715
I really think

25:06.880 --> 25:08.715
you'll feel better

25:08.715 --> 25:09.925
after going through this stuff.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.052
JANE:

25:09.925 --> 25:12.052
I hope so.

25:19.477 --> 25:20.853
I could have sworn

25:20.853 --> 25:22.729
I had another box buried

25:20.853 --> 25:22.729
( camera clicking )

25:22.729 --> 25:24.357
in the back of the

25:22.729 --> 25:24.357
closet somewhere.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.942
No rush. I've got all day.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.695
( camera clicking )

25:29.695 --> 25:31.280
What the hell do you

25:29.695 --> 25:31.280
think you're doing?

25:31.280 --> 25:32.572
Are you spying on me?!

25:32.572 --> 25:34.367
Jane, there's been

25:32.572 --> 25:34.367
an ongoing investigation

25:34.367 --> 25:36.285
into whether Michael was

25:34.367 --> 25:36.285
connected to Sin Rostro.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.120
He didn't do anything!

25:36.285 --> 25:38.120
I'm just trying

25:38.120 --> 25:40.080
to clear his name!

25:38.120 --> 25:40.080
No! Just get out!

25:40.080 --> 25:42.500
DENNIS ( echoing ):

25:40.080 --> 25:42.500
Jane? Was he trustworthy?

25:42.500 --> 25:44.584
Oh.

25:44.584 --> 25:49.965
( in Spanish ):

25:44.584 --> 25:49.965
I wish I could take back my

25:44.584 --> 25:49.965
actions, but since I can't,

25:49.965 --> 25:51.300
here.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.720
Thank you.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.229
How old do you think I am?

26:03.229 --> 26:08.234
I just hope the basket will help

26:03.229 --> 26:08.234
you try to forgive me, Alba.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.609
( sighs )

26:09.609 --> 26:13.072
I'm disappointed

26:09.609 --> 26:13.072
in you, Rogelio.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.407
I know.

26:16.825 --> 26:20.496
But I love you,

26:16.825 --> 26:20.496
and as Jesus said,

26:20.496 --> 26:23.249
"Let he who is without sin

26:20.496 --> 26:23.249
cast the first stone."

26:23.249 --> 26:27.294
Exactly. And who are we

26:23.249 --> 26:27.294
to argue with Jesus?

26:27.294 --> 26:29.296
Mm.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.215
But why did you do it?

26:33.759 --> 26:35.177
I was desperate.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.138
After "penis-gate,"

26:35.177 --> 26:38.138
my career was in the toilet,

26:38.138 --> 26:40.266
and I was desperate for

26:38.138 --> 26:40.266
the<i> De La Vega-Factor Factor</i>

26:40.266 --> 26:42.726
to be a hit.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.726
Hmm.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.186
And was it worth it?

26:44.186 --> 26:46.355
Of course not. I was

26:44.186 --> 26:46.355
totally wrong and stupid,

26:46.355 --> 26:49.942
and I want to tell Xiomara

26:46.355 --> 26:49.942
that but she won't hear me out.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.987
I just want my circumstances

26:49.942 --> 26:53.987
to be factored in!

26:53.987 --> 26:55.239
What?

26:55.239 --> 26:57.783
That's the catchphrase

26:55.239 --> 26:57.783
from your show.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.410
You're losing sight

26:57.783 --> 26:59.410
of what's real.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.996
Rogelio, that's the problem.

27:02.996 --> 27:08.294
Hm? So here's

27:02.996 --> 27:08.294
a reality check.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.713
You have a fake

27:08.294 --> 27:11.713
marriage to Darci,

27:11.713 --> 27:15.968
you don't actually live

27:11.713 --> 27:15.968
in the big house with her,

27:15.968 --> 27:20.556
and you've been lying

27:15.968 --> 27:20.556
to all of us for two years.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.978
That's not who you are.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.440
At least, it's not who

27:25.978 --> 27:29.440
you used to be.

27:43.454 --> 27:45.414
He's not my boyfriend.

And, no, I'm worried about us.

Well, technically,

30:44.009 --> 30:46.261

31:02.944 --> 31:06.031
I'm miserable.

31:02.944 --> 31:06.031

31:06.031 --> 31:09.201
Now I'm famous.

31:06.031 --> 31:09.201
And fame--

31:09.201 --> 31:12.204
it really does a great job

31:09.201 --> 31:12.204
of masking that empty feeling.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.251
Well, I'm done, Darci.

You can't quit.

31:18.251 --> 31:21.380

Yeah. No kidding.

33:46.608 --> 33:49.235
And I'm gonna try

33:46.608 --> 33:49.235
to get back to that guy.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.404
And he was honest.

33:51.404 --> 33:54.240
And if I'm honest,

33:54.240 --> 33:58.244
I think I agreed to the cut

33:54.240 --> 33:58.244
because I was jealous.

33:58.244 --> 34:01.289
You had just

33:58.244 --> 34:01.289
moved in with Bruce,

34:01.289 --> 34:04.626
and I think

34:01.289 --> 34:04.626
I wanted to hurt you.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.798
And I'm so sorry.

NARRATOR:

34:11.967 --> 34:15.428
<i>And from one troubled</i>

34:11.967 --> 34:15.428

34:15.428 --> 34:17.973
<i>Oh, wow! Look at Jane!</i>

34:17.973 --> 34:19.975
<i>She's pummeling him!</i>

34:22.143 --> 34:23.687
<i>In her mind.</i>

34:22.143 --> 34:23.687
( bell dings )

34:23.687 --> 34:25.230
<i>In reality...</i>

34:25.230 --> 34:27.649
You are such a jerk!

34:27.649 --> 34:28.901
I'm so mad at you.

34:28.901 --> 34:30.109
Whoa.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.737
No kicking.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.737
Sorry.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.321
I know you're mad.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.740
Punch me back.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.074
No.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.074
You can use me

34:36.074 --> 34:38.201
and betray me--

34:36.074 --> 34:38.201
that's punching me!

34:38.201 --> 34:40.119
I didn't use you.

34:40.119 --> 34:41.329
You did!

34:41.329 --> 34:42.664
I trusted you,

34:42.664 --> 34:44.416
and you went through

34:42.664 --> 34:44.416
Michael's stuff!

34:44.416 --> 34:47.711
I had to.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.711
What-- you had to spy on him?

34:47.711 --> 34:49.170
I was trying to clear his name.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.297
The whole time, I was

34:49.170 --> 34:51.297
trying to clear his name.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.091
I don't believe that.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.091
It's true.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.260
There was an investigation.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.260
You didn't have to work it.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.845
Would you want

34:55.260 --> 34:56.845
someone else to?

34:56.845 --> 34:59.056
You could have told me!

34:56.845 --> 34:59.056
I was trying to protect you.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.307
I don't need protecting!

35:01.307 --> 35:03.226
Not now, but then.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.395
You were having panic

35:03.226 --> 35:05.395
attacks every day!

35:05.395 --> 35:06.813
( bell dings )

35:05.395 --> 35:06.813
( grunts )

35:13.695 --> 35:15.572
I'm sorry, again.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.408
Not your fault.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.326
( sighs )

35:20.326 --> 35:21.620
You're right.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.959
I was in

35:23.663 --> 35:26.959
a different place then.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.544
( sighs )

35:29.544 --> 35:32.171
It just sucked,

35:29.544 --> 35:32.171
because you were the one person

35:32.171 --> 35:34.173
that I could talk to

35:32.171 --> 35:34.173
or could--

35:34.173 --> 35:37.385
I don't know--

35:34.173 --> 35:37.385
tell me new things

35:37.385 --> 35:40.639
about Michael,

35:37.385 --> 35:40.639
things I didn't know.

35:40.639 --> 35:44.142
Hearing that he was

35:40.639 --> 35:44.142
a ball hog, or...

35:46.103 --> 35:49.439
...what he said after

35:46.103 --> 35:49.439
our first date or whatever.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.569
It just kept him alive a little.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.154
I know.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.033
Well, I'm here

35:57.990 --> 36:00.033
every Tuesday,

36:00.033 --> 36:01.868
if you ever get

36:00.033 --> 36:01.868
the urge to talk,

36:01.868 --> 36:04.955
or, you know,

36:01.868 --> 36:04.955
hit me again.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.876
Maybe I will.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.170
So should we

36:09.876 --> 36:12.170
talk about Scott?

36:12.170 --> 36:15.381
Nah. We actually ruled it

36:12.170 --> 36:15.381
an accident this morning.

36:15.381 --> 36:18.802
Really? 'Cause I had a list of,

36:15.381 --> 36:18.802
like, 50 suspects in mind.

36:21.805 --> 36:24.223
Yep. The Marbella is totally

36:21.805 --> 36:24.223
off the hook.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.391
The Fairwick, too.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.060
JANE:

36:25.391 --> 36:27.060
<i>That's great.</i>

36:27.060 --> 36:28.603
I'm so happy for you.

36:28.603 --> 36:31.439
Oh. How is Mateo?

36:28.603 --> 36:31.439
Did he go down without a fight?

36:31.439 --> 36:34.067
We went a few rounds, but Fuzzy

36:31.439 --> 36:34.067
Bunny talked him into it.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.194
Oh, Fuzzy Bunny is such a creep.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.821
( Funny Bunny voice ):

36:36.194 --> 36:37.821
It hurts my feelings

36:37.821 --> 36:39.322
when you say that about me,

36:37.821 --> 36:39.322
Jane.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.867
( laughs ):

36:39.322 --> 36:41.867
Creepy.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.410
( laughs )

36:41.867 --> 36:44.410
JANE:<i> Oh, that reminds me,</i>

36:44.410 --> 36:47.372
I'm going to be a little late

36:44.410 --> 36:47.372
tomorrow picking him up.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.832
I'm meeting Gary for breakfast.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.458
I'm going to ply him

36:48.832 --> 36:50.458
with mimosas,

36:50.458 --> 36:52.460
and get him to come back

36:50.458 --> 36:52.460
to Chloe. Hmm?

36:52.460 --> 36:53.879
<i>Jane, stop.</i>

36:53.879 --> 36:55.630
Just come manage the lounge.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.007
I can't.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.842
<i>Why? You'd be good at it.</i>

36:58.842 --> 37:00.093
<i>Plus, you love everybody there.</i>

37:00.093 --> 37:02.179
I have to think long-term,

37:00.093 --> 37:02.179
career-wise.

37:02.179 --> 37:04.347
This isn't about your career,

37:02.179 --> 37:04.347
this is just to buy time.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.682
You don't know that.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.184
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

37:07.184 --> 37:08.601
You just got a book deal.

37:08.601 --> 37:09.978
W-Which might not go anywhere.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.229
<i>What?</i>

37:11.229 --> 37:12.939
Hit books are few

37:11.229 --> 37:12.939
and far between.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.734
<i>And if it doesn't</i>

37:12.939 --> 37:15.734
<i>happen for me,</i>

37:15.734 --> 37:17.443
then I'd be a lounge manager,

37:17.443 --> 37:19.946
as opposed to someone working

37:17.443 --> 37:19.946
in the publishing industry.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.781
You're talking about

37:19.946 --> 37:21.781
if you fail.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.533
I'm being practical.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.451
What happened

37:23.533 --> 37:25.451
to following your dreams?

37:26.912 --> 37:29.581
Well, y-you know, I...

37:29.581 --> 37:31.208
I had a dream.

37:31.208 --> 37:34.127
(<i> romantic theme playing</i> )

37:34.127 --> 37:36.171
RAFAEL:

37:34.127 --> 37:36.171
<i>I know.</i>

37:36.171 --> 37:37.756
But you do have other ones.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.217
<i>And I won't let you get stuck</i>

37:37.756 --> 37:40.217
<i>in the lounge.</i>

37:40.217 --> 37:41.927
Okay?

37:41.927 --> 37:43.469
Two years and you're out.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.013
Promise?

37:45.013 --> 37:46.890
Promise.

37:46.890 --> 37:50.185
Because you'd want me

37:46.890 --> 37:50.185
to tell you if you were stuck.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.145
Exactly.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.563
You're stuck.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.607
<i>At work, you're basically</i>

37:53.563 --> 37:55.607
<i>Petra's bitch.</i>

37:55.607 --> 37:57.275
<i>And I say that</i>

37:55.607 --> 37:57.275
<i>with full respect</i>

37:57.275 --> 37:58.651
for Petra.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.361
You're not gonna turn back

37:58.651 --> 38:00.361
into greedy,

38:00.361 --> 38:02.030
shady, amoral Rafael

38:02.030 --> 38:04.157
just because you care about

38:02.030 --> 38:04.157
the Marbella.

38:04.157 --> 38:07.619
Greedy, shady, amoral Rafael?

38:07.619 --> 38:10.329
Paraphrasing.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.329
Just think about it.

38:10.329 --> 38:13.833
NARRATOR:

38:10.329 --> 38:13.833
<i>Which he did, for the record.</i>

38:13.833 --> 38:16.711
So just like that?

38:16.711 --> 38:19.714
After a year of "you decide,"

38:16.711 --> 38:19.714
you want to start weighing in.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.759
Yes. I'm ready.

38:22.759 --> 38:25.428
Well, it's about time.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.639
ABBEY: See?

38:25.428 --> 38:27.639
I knew she'd be happy.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.390
NARRATOR:

38:27.639 --> 38:29.390
<i>Oh, God. Sorry, again.</i>

38:29.390 --> 38:31.726
<i>So embarrassing.</i>

38:29.390 --> 38:31.726
<i>I should look into this.</i>

38:31.726 --> 38:33.686
Well, he actually has

38:31.726 --> 38:33.686
good ideas sometimes.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.730
Wow. High praise.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.107
But he has to lose

38:35.730 --> 38:37.107
the beard, right?

38:37.107 --> 38:38.399
Oh, absolutely.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.651
Yeah.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.236
It's a prerequisite.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.905
I'm going back

38:41.236 --> 38:43.905
to telenovelas, Mateo.

38:43.905 --> 38:47.117
You are too young to remember,

38:43.905 --> 38:47.117
but Papa played some epic roles.

38:47.117 --> 38:50.078
So my next role

38:47.117 --> 38:50.078
needs to be even bigger.

38:50.078 --> 38:53.331
NARRATOR:

38:50.078 --> 38:53.331
<i>Or much, much, much smaller.</i>

38:56.168 --> 38:58.962
<i>But we're not there yet.</i>

38:58.962 --> 39:00.546
Ooh, it's my agent.

39:00.546 --> 39:01.881
Hi, Barry.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.216
Hi, Barry.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.303
Oh.

39:06.303 --> 39:08.138
I see.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.639
Okay.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.141
Thank you.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.228
What's wrong?

39:15.228 --> 39:16.688
It's nothing.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.065
Tell me.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.065
I want to be factored in.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.733
Hmm.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.945
I'm being sued for $10 million

39:20.733 --> 39:23.945
for breach of contract.

39:23.945 --> 39:26.323
That sounds bad.

39:23.945 --> 39:26.323
Can you send them a basket?

39:26.323 --> 39:29.075
NARRATOR:

39:26.323 --> 39:29.075
<i>If the basket</i>

39:26.323 --> 39:29.075
<i>is full of $10 million.</i>

39:29.075 --> 39:30.618
Sonia, can you cover

39:29.075 --> 39:30.618
six and seven

39:30.618 --> 39:32.245
for Joey until

39:30.618 --> 39:32.245
he gets back from break?

39:32.245 --> 39:34.372
Yeah, no problem.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.372
Thank you.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.167
NARRATOR:

39:34.372 --> 39:37.167
<i>Yep. Rocking that manager job.</i>

39:39.169 --> 39:43.882
<i>And in that instant, friends,</i>

39:39.169 --> 39:43.882
<i>Jane was reminded of Michael.</i>

39:43.882 --> 39:47.927
<i>And dare I say,</i>

39:43.882 --> 39:47.927
<i>it felt a little like a sign.</i>

39:47.927 --> 39:49.929
<i>The first in a long time.</i>

39:49.929 --> 39:51.348
( sighs )

39:51.348 --> 39:52.724
Found it.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.850
( chuckles )

39:53.850 --> 39:55.518
RAFAEL:

39:53.850 --> 39:55.518
Okay.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.687
Now that you've made it

39:55.518 --> 39:57.687
through your first day,

39:57.687 --> 39:59.314
I am officially giving you

39:59.314 --> 40:01.274
your one-year, 51-week,

39:59.314 --> 40:01.274
six-day notice.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.235
That won't be necessary,

40:01.274 --> 40:03.235
because I will have quit

40:03.235 --> 40:04.527
in a blaze of glory by then,

40:04.527 --> 40:05.820
because I am a writer.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.405
I have a book deal.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.532
A messenger sent over

40:07.405 --> 40:09.532
the paperwork and everything.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.783
Huh? Pfft.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.327
( squeals )

40:12.327 --> 40:13.953
PETRA:

40:12.327 --> 40:13.953
<i>What's all this?</i>

40:13.953 --> 40:15.330
They're flowers.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.082
It's what someone brings

40:15.330 --> 40:17.082
when he's taking

40:17.082 --> 40:18.457
someone else on a date,

40:18.457 --> 40:20.543
which is what I'm gonna do.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.671
Just take your pants off.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.840
You don't need to take me

40:23.671 --> 40:25.840
to dinner first.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.884
( chuckles ):

40:25.840 --> 40:27.884
No.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.302
I want to go out.

40:29.302 --> 40:31.679
A proper date.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.349
Come on.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.184
You wouldn't have

40:34.349 --> 40:36.184
tried to help my hotel

40:36.184 --> 40:39.229
if you didn't

40:36.184 --> 40:39.229
"like me" like me.

40:39.229 --> 40:41.981
Fine.

40:41.981 --> 40:46.152
Maybe I...

40:41.981 --> 40:46.152
"like you" like you.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.196
You happy?

40:55.161 --> 40:57.247
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

41:05.338 --> 41:06.839
NARRATOR:

41:05.338 --> 41:06.839
<i>Hmm.</i>

41:06.839 --> 41:09.134
<i>Looks like</i>

41:06.839 --> 41:09.134
<i>something's troubling Petra.</i>

41:09.134 --> 41:11.136
<i>I wonder what it could be.</i>

41:11.136 --> 41:14.555
<i>Sorry. I'm just being coy.</i>

41:11.136 --> 41:14.555
<i>I know what it is.</i>

41:14.555 --> 41:15.932
<i>I'll show you.</i>

41:15.932 --> 41:18.017
( thunder crashes )

41:30.529 --> 41:33.616
<i>Yep. Petra's been</i>

41:30.529 --> 41:33.616
<i>hiding something.</i>

41:33.616 --> 41:35.327
<i>And she's not the only one.</i>

41:35.327 --> 41:37.120
That was close.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.956
It would've been bad for us

41:37.120 --> 41:39.956
if they'd ruled it a murder.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.124
I know.

41:41.124 --> 41:42.541
NARRATOR:

41:41.124 --> 41:42.541
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

41:42.541 --> 41:44.543
<i>What the hell are you up to,</i>

41:42.541 --> 41:44.543
<i>Rafael?</i>

41:52.427 --> 41:54.595
