Let's clean up
before Bama gets here.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.172
I don't want her telling me
I'm a lousy housekeeper.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.522
Oh, shoot. I gotta get ready.
We're supposed
to be at the bank.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.481
Why do you have
to go to the bank?

00:46.524 --> 00:48.135
Because we need money
for stuff, like your braces.

00:48.178 --> 00:51.094
But I don't want braces.
I want a video game player.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.531
Charlie, your mama's gonna
tell you something true.

was folded. It will be

01:34.398 --> 01:36.879

Gum with nicotine.

How's the knee?

Oh, doesn't work

last two husbands. Heh.

01:46.889 --> 01:49.370
What are you gonna do
if the bank turns you down?

01:49.413 --> 01:51.067
No idea.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.765
Well, it ain't
a sin to be poor,
but it's damned inconvenient.

01:53.809 --> 01:56.333
Well, what do y'all think?

It's gonna be harder for
the banker to turn you down
in that outfit.

02:04.776 --> 02:08.476
That's what I'm counting on.
Like you said, "Use it
until you lose it."

What smells like pumpkin pie?
Oh, it's me.

02:14.221 --> 02:17.398
These scientists did
a test and figured out
that the smell of pumpkin

02:17.441 --> 02:20.836
brings blood flow to a man's
you-know-what faster
than anything else.

02:20.879 --> 02:23.404
Where'd you hear that?
I read it in some
woman's magazine.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.971
August 2006 issue.
Reese Witherspoon
was on the cover.

03:43.440 --> 03:47.879
Well, we're here about,
uh, this letter.

03:50.665 --> 03:53.450
Well, I'd say
it's a bit more than a letter.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.757
This is a notice of intent
to foreclose.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.629
Yes, and we know we're
seriously behind
in our payments,

03:58.673 --> 04:00.979
but the rates
suddenly jumped so high...

04:01.023 --> 04:02.894
As adjustable rates do.

04:02.938 --> 04:06.463
Mr. Sweeny, it's like I was
trying to tell you
on the telephone,

04:06.507 --> 04:08.987
my physical therapy job
just got phased out

04:09.031 --> 04:11.512
and Rex here, well,
he hurt his knee so bad

04:11.555 --> 04:14.297
that he had to quit his
construction job
and get surgery.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.994
We're just trying to pay back
the medical bills.

04:16.038 --> 04:18.345
The healing's been
a whole lot slower than
I'd hoped.

04:18.387 --> 04:21.348
I sympathize, but mortgage
payments must be maintained...

04:21.391 --> 04:24.786
It's not just about the
mortgage. We're strapped.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.483
Completely.

04:26.527 --> 04:31.401
Getting dinner on the table,
it's hard. We need more time.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.925
But, Mrs. Horton,
I can't really give you...

04:33.969 --> 04:35.971
You can call me Sam.

04:37.102 --> 04:38.800

04:42.543 --> 04:44.632
That's an interesting scent
you're wearing.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.504
You like it?
Very much.

04:49.854 --> 04:53.118
But, uh, there's nothing
I can do.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.425
With the current financial
situation,

04:55.469 --> 04:58.907
this bank must take a
zero-tolerance position
on non-payment.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.996
But what about the government
bailing you out
to help us out?

05:01.039 --> 05:02.345
Where's the help?

05:02.389 --> 05:04.347
All I can tell you

05:04.391 --> 05:07.437
is that unless
we receive payment
on the 15th of this month,

05:07.481 --> 05:10.353
foreclosure
proceedings will begin.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.399
And we'll lose our home.
Yes.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.749
That is what
foreclosure means.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.881
I'm sorry.
SAM: No, you're not.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.363
Not really.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.713
Even though
you're plenty at
fault here too.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.106
The day we met you,

05:24.149 --> 05:27.152
you told us that a subprime
ARM loan made good sense

05:27.196 --> 05:29.503
and not to worry
about rate adjustments

05:29.546 --> 05:31.548
because we would be able
to refinance
before the loan resets.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.681
Then you told us it would be
"advantageous

05:33.724 --> 05:37.075
for us to enhance our income
statement to help facilitate
the approving process."

05:37.119 --> 05:39.991
Those were your words,
exactly.

05:40.035 --> 05:44.169
Now, I don't think any of us
remembers
exactly what was said.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.475
She does.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.564
You were wearing
a black-and-gray coat,

05:47.608 --> 05:49.566
with a taupe shirt
and a cream tie.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.742
It had a quarter-sized
hot sauce stain on it.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.701
You were worried
because you were

05:53.744 --> 05:55.616
getting ready to
take your photo ID.

05:58.053 --> 06:01.535
There's the tie
and there's the stain.

06:01.578 --> 06:05.539
Now, what exactly
don't I remember, exactly?

06:09.891 --> 06:11.719
Like I said.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.811
At least you got
a month's extension.
It's something.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.466
Is it?
What's gonna make it better
next month?

06:19.509 --> 06:21.424
Chocolate milk shakes
and cheese fries.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.427
That will make it better
for about five minutes,
but I'll take it.

I would join the Army
if I could wear heels.

06:33.610 --> 06:36.613
We'd hire you at
the bar if we could.
I know you would.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.007
There's nothing
promising for Rex?
Not a thing.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.835
Nobody's even hiring.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.533

06:46.884 --> 06:48.233
Men are complicated.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.105
No, they're not. Men are easy.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.803
"I'm thirsty,"
"I'm hungry," "I'm horny."
That's men.

in that order.

It is what it is.

01:25:47.664 --> 01:25:49.231
School?

01:25:49.274 --> 01:25:50.754
Hard.

01:25:50.797 --> 01:25:52.190
Scary.

01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:53.844
Exciting.

01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:57.239
Well, you look good.

01:25:58.718 --> 01:26:00.633
You look real good.

01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:04.681
I'm glad you're
looking at me again.

01:26:10.904 --> 01:26:14.212
I can't believe
our baby's 4 years old.

01:26:14.256 --> 01:26:16.997
She sure was
the best
birthday present ever.

01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:20.305
You know,
it's good to share a birthday
with your child.

01:26:20.349 --> 01:26:22.829
It keeps the day
from ever being
able to get you down.

01:26:23.961 --> 01:26:26.442
She loved that dollhouse
you got her.

01:26:26.485 --> 01:26:28.444
She wanted a pony.

01:26:29.836 --> 01:26:31.577
What about you?

01:26:33.057 --> 01:26:34.450
What do you want?

01:26:37.409 --> 01:26:39.411
You know what I want.

01:26:48.072 --> 01:26:50.379
I'm taking baby steps.

01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:56.689
What do you think?

01:26:56.733 --> 01:26:59.953
I think that's the second-best
birthday present I ever got.
