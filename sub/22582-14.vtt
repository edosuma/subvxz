WEBVTT

00:09.288 --> 00:12.724
Your neurolytic enzymes
are considerably higher than last month.

00:14.168 --> 00:15.886
The treatment's no longer effective?

00:16.008 --> 00:18.203
I told you it was just a matter of time...

00:18.328 --> 00:20.398
before we'd need
supplemental medications.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.758
This conference is
a perfect opportunity.

00:22.888 --> 00:24.924
Some of your finest physicians
will be there.

00:25.048 --> 00:26.925
It's essential that I speak with them.

00:27.048 --> 00:28.845
It's too great a risk.

00:29.008 --> 00:30.361
I'd be taken off Enterprise.

00:30.488 --> 00:33.560
I think I can question them
without revealing that you're infected.

00:33.688 --> 00:35.485
It's too great a risk.

00:35.728 --> 00:37.878
I'm afraid we have no choice.

00:38.128 --> 00:41.564
Without further treatment,
you could very possibly die.

00:46.888 --> 00:49.448
It's been a long road

00:51.448 --> 00:53.484
Gettin' from there to here

00:54.568 --> 00:56.923
It's been a long time

00:58.168 --> 01:01.444
But my time is finally near

01:02.008 --> 01:05.683
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:06.328 --> 01:09.445
I will touch the sky

01:09.568 --> 01:13.163
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:13.288 --> 01:16.200
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:16.328 --> 01:20.799
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:20.928 --> 01:23.840
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:23.968 --> 01:27.802
I've got faith to believe

01:28.528 --> 01:31.201
I can do anything

01:31.328 --> 01:35.241
I've got strength of the soul

01:35.888 --> 01:38.766
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:38.888 --> 01:42.563
I can reach any star

01:44.288 --> 01:46.358
I've got faith

01:48.048 --> 01:50.960
I've got faith

01:51.848 --> 01:55.045
Faith of the heart

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074

02:09.488 --> 02:11.240
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

02:11.368 --> 02:13.279
We've entered orbit of Dekendi III...

02:13.408 --> 02:16.400
where the Interspecies Medical
Exchange is hosting a conference.

02:16.528 --> 02:19.520
We'll be picking up a neutron
microscope, but more importantly...

02:19.648 --> 02:22.208
we'll get a chance to meet
one of Phlox's wives.

02:22.328 --> 02:23.602
How long has it been, Doc?

02:23.728 --> 02:26.686
Oh, I haven't seen Feezal
for nearly four years.

02:26.808 --> 02:29.959
What's the point of having three wives
if you never get to see them?

02:30.088 --> 02:32.522
Denobulans are renowned
for their patience.

02:34.848 --> 02:37.681
- Welcome, my beloved.
- My beloved.

02:46.368 --> 02:49.360
Captain Archer, I'd like you to meet
my second wife, Feezal.

02:49.488 --> 02:51.080
It's a pleasure to have you aboard.

02:51.208 --> 02:52.163
Thank you.

02:52.288 --> 02:54.677
And this is our chief engineer,
Commander Tucker.

02:54.808 --> 02:55.797
Ma'am.

02:55.928 --> 02:58.840
I look forward to helping you
install the microscope.

02:59.008 --> 03:00.999
We can hold that off till later.

03:01.128 --> 03:04.120
I'm sure the two of you are eager
to spend some time together.

03:04.248 --> 03:05.647
Nonsense, Captain.

03:05.768 --> 03:09.522
We've been apart for four years.
Another hour, another day...

03:10.168 --> 03:12.363
As I said, we're very patient.

03:13.408 --> 03:17.117
Why don't we have lunch
while the microscope's being unloaded?

03:17.328 --> 03:18.886
I'd be honoured.

03:23.528 --> 03:25.325
Won't you be joining us, Commander?

03:25.448 --> 03:27.484
I'd love to,
but I think I should make sure...

03:27.608 --> 03:29.724
your equipment gets up to Sickbay
in one piece.

03:29.848 --> 03:32.567
- Then I'll see you after lunch?
- You bet.

04:03.648 --> 04:05.127
It seems odd, doesn't it...

04:05.248 --> 04:08.797
that a Denobulan physician would be
interested in a Vulcan disease?

04:08.928 --> 04:10.441
One of my colleagues on Denobula...

04:10.568 --> 04:13.287
has been studying Pa'nar Syndrome
for some time.

04:13.408 --> 04:16.161
Its pathology is quite similar
to thymic sclerosis.

04:16.288 --> 04:17.880
Thymic sclerosis?

04:18.048 --> 04:21.927
It's a non-fatal illness which we've had
very little success treating.

04:22.048 --> 04:23.766
I promised him,
my colleague back home...

04:23.888 --> 04:26.641
that I'd inquire about any recent
advances in its treatment.

04:26.768 --> 04:29.521
We're hesitant to discuss
Pa'nar Syndrome, Doctor.

04:29.888 --> 04:34.564
This illness is unique to a subculture,
a small percentage of our population.

04:34.728 --> 04:38.038
Their behaviour is neither tolerated
nor sanctioned.

04:38.248 --> 04:40.762
My friend is well aware of that.
Unfortunately...

04:40.888 --> 04:44.642
thymic sclerosis is found in all strata
of Denobulan society.

04:44.848 --> 04:47.442
Developing a cure
is of paramount importance.

04:47.568 --> 04:49.763
Do you have any literature
on this disease?

04:49.888 --> 04:52.561
As I told you, I'm currently serving
on a Starfleet vessel.

04:52.688 --> 04:55.043
Humans are non susceptible to it.

04:55.168 --> 04:57.398
I could contact my colleague...

04:57.688 --> 05:00.998
but it would take at least five days
before we'd receive a response.

05:01.128 --> 05:03.517
I'm afraid we'll have returned to Vulcan
by then.

05:03.648 --> 05:05.445
Anything you could provide me with...

05:05.568 --> 05:08.128
would be instrumental in helping
the Denobulan people.

05:08.248 --> 05:10.239
We'll have to discuss
your request, Doctor.

05:10.368 --> 05:13.917
When we've reached a decision,
we'll contact you aboard your ship.

05:15.568 --> 05:17.479
Thank you for your time.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.846
If the reflectometer is supposed to
amplify the neutron stream...

05:24.968 --> 05:26.879
shouldn't it be installed
before the emitters?

05:27.008 --> 05:29.442
It's collimating the neutrons,
not amplifying them.

05:29.568 --> 05:32.366
If you read the instructions,
you'll find it's all very clear.

05:32.488 --> 05:35.719
I've tried to read the instructions,
and they are anything but clear.

05:35.848 --> 05:37.759
I don't want to brag,
but I can take apart...

05:37.888 --> 05:40.766
and put back together
any piece of equipment I've ever met.

05:40.888 --> 05:44.005
That's one of the reasons Captain
Archer picked me for this mission...

05:44.128 --> 05:46.767
because I am really good
at following instructions.

05:46.888 --> 05:50.403
- But these are in...
- Denobulan. I understand.

05:50.688 --> 05:53.964
That's why I'm here.
So let's go through it slowly.

05:54.128 --> 05:56.961
Do you see the threads
on the aperture ring?

05:57.168 --> 05:58.521
- Here.
- Exactly.

05:58.648 --> 06:01.720
Take the smaller condenser lens
and screw it on.

06:05.328 --> 06:09.879
Now re-modulate the emitter frequency.
That'll initiate the neutron stream.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.602
Which one?

06:17.448 --> 06:20.406
You're going to have to help me
with this one.

06:20.648 --> 06:24.277
It's very simple.
Insert the thick end into this opening...

06:24.808 --> 06:27.197
it'll automatically program
the frequency.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.919
You can pull it out now.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.078
The stream should be initiated.

06:33.608 --> 06:35.678
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

06:36.768 --> 06:40.044
Maybe if you explain
the next few steps, I could...

06:40.168 --> 06:42.045
try and get through some of this
on my own.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.567
By all means.

06:44.008 --> 06:46.966
You're a very confident young man,
aren't you?

06:47.688 --> 06:49.041
I try to be.

06:56.528 --> 06:59.600
You're going to need to come
a little closer to see this.

07:03.528 --> 07:06.088
Have you spoken to Phlox
since he got back?

07:06.208 --> 07:07.641
I wasn't aware he was gone.

07:07.768 --> 07:09.759
You must have not seen him
yesterday morning.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.607
He was champing at the bit
to get down to that conference.

07:12.728 --> 07:15.800
Brought back a wish list
of medical instruments.

07:16.088 --> 07:19.967
It is the first I.M.E. Conference
he's attended in over a year.

07:20.328 --> 07:22.284
He said there was a Vulcan contingent.

07:22.408 --> 07:26.242
You might want to go down for a visit.
You may know one of them.

07:26.368 --> 07:28.928
There are over one million physicians
on Vulcan.

07:29.048 --> 07:33.439
I would think you'd enjoy spending time
with members of your own species.

07:34.608 --> 07:35.597
Archer.

07:35.728 --> 07:38.288
A Vulcan transport has requested
permission to dock, sir.

07:38.408 --> 07:40.842
- They've already left the surface.
- Speak of the devil.

07:40.968 --> 07:42.686
Looks like you won't
have to go anywhere.

07:42.808 --> 07:44.241
I'll meet them at Docking Port 2.

07:44.368 --> 07:47.360
They've asked that the doctor join you,
and Subcommander T'Pol.

07:47.488 --> 07:50.048
- Let him know, okay?
- Right away, sir.

07:55.248 --> 07:57.842
You have any idea what this is about?

07:58.008 --> 08:00.761
I haven't spoken to anyone
on the surface.

08:00.968 --> 08:04.005
You can bet they're not coming up
for coffee and doughnuts.

08:04.848 --> 08:06.122
Can I get you something?

08:06.248 --> 08:09.240
Thanks to Subcommander T'Pol,
our chef has learned to make some...

08:09.368 --> 08:11.359
pretty decent plomeek soup.

08:11.488 --> 08:13.365
We appreciate
your hospitality, Captain...

08:13.488 --> 08:16.878
but we've come to speak
to your doctor, with your permission.

08:17.008 --> 08:20.239
Absolutely. If you need anything,
just let me know.

08:20.688 --> 08:23.202
We would appreciate it
if T'Pol would remain.

08:27.288 --> 08:28.721
Subcommander.

08:36.087 --> 08:37.840
We've discussed your request.

08:37.967 --> 08:42.086
Unfortunately, we are still hesitant to
share data regarding Pa'nar Syndrome.

08:43.727 --> 08:46.003
Subcommander T'Pol is not aware
of my request.

08:46.128 --> 08:48.722
I'm curious why you asked her to stay.

08:49.128 --> 08:51.596
You're requesting information
about a Vulcan disease...

08:51.728 --> 08:54.447
and you didn't discuss it
with your Vulcan Science Officer?

08:54.568 --> 08:55.683
That's correct.

08:55.808 --> 08:58.959
As far as I know, her expertise
does not include medicine.

08:59.128 --> 09:01.688
Are you familiar with Pa'nar Syndrome,
Subcommander?

09:01.808 --> 09:02.843
Of course.

09:04.048 --> 09:05.879
Would you mind describing it?

09:06.568 --> 09:10.481
You are physicians. Why would you
need me to define an illness?

09:10.608 --> 09:12.564
Please, indulge us.

09:13.768 --> 09:17.238
It's an incurable degradation
of the synaptic pathways.

09:17.408 --> 09:19.876
It also affects the endocrine
and immune systems.

09:20.008 --> 09:21.600
An impressive definition.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.958
Could you tell us how the disease
is transmitted?

09:24.088 --> 09:25.965
Through a telepathic practice.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.164
And what practice would that be?

09:29.328 --> 09:30.647
Mind-melds.

09:30.808 --> 09:31.763
They cause a disruption...

09:31.888 --> 09:34.197
of neuroelectric impulses
in the midbrain...

09:34.328 --> 09:36.922
which can lead to the early stages
of the syndrome.

09:37.048 --> 09:40.245
Do you condone these acts,
Subcommander? These mind-melds?

09:40.888 --> 09:43.641
I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me
why you asked me here.

09:43.768 --> 09:44.757
As would I.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.083
Your questions to T'Pol
seem inappropriate.

09:47.728 --> 09:52.244
Dr. Phlox has asked for data regarding
the treatment of Pa'nar Syndrome.

09:53.168 --> 09:55.921
Did you have anything to do
with that request?

09:56.048 --> 09:57.879
I believe I was very clear about that.

09:58.008 --> 10:00.647
Yes. Your "colleague" on Denobula.

10:01.848 --> 10:04.487
Forgive us Doctor, but since there's
a Vulcan serving on your ship...

10:04.608 --> 10:06.519
a fact that you neglected
to mention to us...

10:06.648 --> 10:09.765
we had to consider
other possible motives for your inquiry.

10:09.888 --> 10:11.799
What motive are you suggesting?

10:14.288 --> 10:17.007
Are you familiar
with any of these names?

10:19.928 --> 10:23.079
They're Vulcan.
I'm not familiar with any of them.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.442
They're melders.

10:24.568 --> 10:28.243
Vulcans with the ability to transfer
thoughts and memories to each other.

10:28.368 --> 10:30.359
Do you know any melders,
Subcommander?

10:30.488 --> 10:33.088
Not well. But I've met a number of them.

10:33.248 --> 10:36.399
Then I'll ask you again.
Do you condone their behaviour?

10:36.528 --> 10:40.077
I don't understand what your questions
have to do with the doctor's request.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.642
We find their behaviour unacceptable...

10:42.768 --> 10:45.919
and since Pa'nar Syndrome
is transmitted by these people...

10:46.088 --> 10:48.602
its cure is not a priority.

10:48.808 --> 10:51.117
Are you saying
there is no additional research?

10:51.248 --> 10:54.763
None that we'd care to disseminate.
I'm sorry.

10:55.408 --> 10:58.957
You travelled up from the surface
to tell Dr. Phlox you wouldn't help him?

10:59.368 --> 11:01.199
If you'll please show us to the airlock.

11:26.288 --> 11:28.882
- Is it definitive?
- Unmistakably.

11:30.488 --> 11:32.524
She's suffering from the syndrome.

11:37.808 --> 11:41.164
Now watch. A simple strand
of protein molecules...

11:41.488 --> 11:45.083
can be enlarged and enhanced...

11:45.248 --> 11:48.126
to where we can clearly see
a single nucleotide.

11:48.248 --> 11:51.524
- Amazing. Look at that. Are those...
- Carbon atoms.

11:53.608 --> 11:55.121
Now you try it.

11:55.688 --> 11:59.158
- First I re-initialise the neutron stream.
- Precisely.

12:00.288 --> 12:03.007
Very good.
Now align the quantum filters.

12:05.008 --> 12:07.806
- This is a bitch.
- Excuse me?

12:08.728 --> 12:12.403
Oh, not you, the microscope.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.119
Has Vesena forgiven Groznik yet?

12:16.568 --> 12:20.038
Absolutely not.
Groznik has only apologised twice.

12:20.848 --> 12:23.442
I doubt he'll be forgiven
for another two years.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.844
- Well, at least he has his other wives.
- Not wives, wife.

12:27.048 --> 12:29.926
Kessil moved to Teerza Prime
to be with her third husband.

12:30.048 --> 12:32.164
Did I do this right?
Why is there no image?

12:32.288 --> 12:34.244
You forgot to enter
the frequency parameters.

12:34.368 --> 12:37.246
Which one was her third husband?
Oh, was that Klaban?

12:37.368 --> 12:40.007
Bogga. Klaban was Forlisa's husband.

12:40.488 --> 12:41.887
Her first, I think.

12:42.408 --> 12:43.807
There you go.

12:45.208 --> 12:48.837
- Why isn't it sharp?
- You forgot to stabilise the aperture.

12:48.968 --> 12:52.119
That's just a reflection
from the imaging filament.

12:52.248 --> 12:53.727
It's all right.

12:53.928 --> 12:56.442
We'll re-initialise the neutron stream
and start again.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.762
Forlisa.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.126
Oh, my.

13:03.208 --> 13:06.484
I thought about asking Forlisa
to be my second wife.

13:06.648 --> 13:09.401
Turned out she already had
three husbands.

13:09.528 --> 13:11.246
Archer to Dr. Phlox.

13:12.888 --> 13:15.448
- Yes, Captain?
- Could you report to my Ready Room?

13:15.568 --> 13:16.842
Certainly.

13:17.248 --> 13:19.682
I'll be back as soon as I can,
my beloved.

13:19.808 --> 13:21.082
Commander.

13:29.448 --> 13:30.642
Come in.

13:31.928 --> 13:33.327
Yes, Captain?

13:33.968 --> 13:36.004
I wanted to see both of you.

13:36.128 --> 13:39.916
It's been a while since I was
embarrassed by a Vulcan dignitary.

13:40.048 --> 13:41.083
Sir?

13:42.088 --> 13:44.079
I just spoke to Dr. Oratt.

13:45.288 --> 13:49.520
It seems you requested some medical
data regarding a Vulcan illness...

13:50.648 --> 13:52.798
for a colleague on Denobula.

13:53.648 --> 13:54.876
Yes, sir.

13:55.128 --> 13:59.246
And both of you said that T'Pol
had nothing to do with that request.

14:00.008 --> 14:03.398
Are you both going to lie to me
like you lied to them?

14:04.688 --> 14:07.600
I have no intention
of lying to you, Captain.

14:07.808 --> 14:10.402
And when were you going to tell me...

14:10.528 --> 14:13.759
that you've contracted a serious illness?

14:15.608 --> 14:16.643
Sir?

14:18.448 --> 14:20.439
They handed you something.

14:20.728 --> 14:23.367
A padd, I think. Does that ring a bell?

14:24.568 --> 14:28.277
You left a fingerprint.
It was enough for them to run tests.

14:28.888 --> 14:30.446
Why did you lie to them?

14:30.608 --> 14:34.362
- It's none of their concern.
- It sure as hell is, if they can help you.

14:37.888 --> 14:41.164
- How long have you known about this?
- Nearly a year.

14:41.368 --> 14:43.324
And you never thought that
maybe you should come to me and...

14:43.448 --> 14:45.120
let me know that one of my officers...

14:45.248 --> 14:46.966
has a potentially fatal disease?

14:47.088 --> 14:51.240
I believe your culture embraces the
concept of doctor-patient confidentiality.

14:51.448 --> 14:53.643
The disease is not contagious.

14:53.808 --> 14:56.845
If we had told you,
there's nothing you could have done.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.996
You still haven't explained to me
why you lied to the Vulcans.

15:03.048 --> 15:06.802
And why would you think
they would be more apt to help you...

15:07.128 --> 15:09.596
if you said it was for
a Denobulan colleague?

15:09.728 --> 15:13.516
Pa'nar Syndrome is an illness
that carries a stigma on Vulcan.

15:13.688 --> 15:16.282
If the High Command was to learn
that I was infected...

15:16.408 --> 15:18.683
I would most likely lose my commission.

15:21.848 --> 15:25.557
- For having a disease?
- It's not about the disease.

15:25.728 --> 15:28.845
It's about the people who are
capable of transmitting it.

15:29.408 --> 15:30.523
Go on.

15:31.688 --> 15:34.156
There are certain Vulcans,
a small minority...

15:34.288 --> 15:38.281
who are born with the ability to perform
a very intimate form of telepathy.

15:38.728 --> 15:41.959
- Intimate?
- A melding of minds.

15:43.848 --> 15:47.602
That ship of Vulcans who were
experimenting with emotions...

15:48.088 --> 15:50.841
They are part of the telepathic minority.

15:50.968 --> 15:54.404
One of the reasons why they left Vulcan
was to escape prejudice.

15:54.968 --> 15:57.641
Their behaviour
is considered unnatural.

15:57.808 --> 15:59.446
They are seen as a threat.

16:00.048 --> 16:03.404
- You belong to that minority?
- No.

16:04.488 --> 16:06.683
- Then...
- Only members of the minority...

16:06.808 --> 16:10.403
can initiate a mind-meld,
but any Vulcan can be the recipient.

16:12.968 --> 16:15.118
Why would you take that risk?

16:16.208 --> 16:17.926
It wasn't by choice.

16:19.008 --> 16:21.283
One of the men on that ship...

16:22.288 --> 16:24.597
You were attacked. I remember.

16:25.608 --> 16:27.724
I'm sure the High Command
will understand.

16:27.848 --> 16:31.284
- I have no intention of telling them.
- Why not?

16:31.968 --> 16:33.606
I have my reasons.

16:36.688 --> 16:38.326
How serious is it?

16:38.848 --> 16:42.045
I've kept it in check,
but the symptoms have progressed.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.285
That's why I requested
the most current research.

16:45.568 --> 16:48.526
Well, your request was accompanied
by a lie...

16:48.768 --> 16:50.963
and whatever your reasons
might have been...

16:51.088 --> 16:52.919
you're no longer welcome
at the conference.

16:53.048 --> 16:55.243
The Vulcans have seen to that.

16:55.648 --> 16:56.797
I understand.

16:57.048 --> 16:59.243
My number one priority here...

16:59.808 --> 17:02.197
is the health of my first officer.

17:02.968 --> 17:05.960
If these doctors have data
that can help her...

17:06.167 --> 17:07.760
I plan to get it.

17:26.968 --> 17:31.837
- I'm sorry. Did we keep you waiting?
- Actually, you did.

17:32.248 --> 17:34.478
What can we do for you, Captain?

17:34.608 --> 17:38.487
Subcommander T'Pol and my doctor
have explained the situation to me.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.242
It's unfortunate that T'Pol is ill.

17:42.368 --> 17:46.520
Dr. Phlox assures me that he was
only trying to protect her privacy.

17:47.328 --> 17:50.877
- He doesn't make a habit of lying.
- I certainly hope not.

17:52.768 --> 17:55.601
I'm having a little difficulty...

17:56.248 --> 17:59.399
understanding why you won't share
your research...

17:59.648 --> 18:03.402
especially now that you know
it could help T'Pol's condition.

18:04.648 --> 18:08.243
I can't believe you're withholding it
to punish Dr. Phlox.

18:08.448 --> 18:10.200
Our decision has nothing
to do with that.

18:10.328 --> 18:12.364
Then what does it have to do with?

18:12.568 --> 18:14.718
Pa'nar Syndrome is a disease
that's unique...

18:14.848 --> 18:17.078
to an undesirable segment
of our population.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.642
Thankfully, there are very few of them.

18:19.768 --> 18:22.407
And because you
find them undesirable...

18:23.648 --> 18:25.843
they're not entitled to medical care?

18:26.208 --> 18:29.518
We don't condone the intimate acts
that these people engage in.

18:29.648 --> 18:31.878
They defy everything
our society stands for.

18:32.008 --> 18:33.441
Intimate acts?

18:33.928 --> 18:36.237
You're talking about mind-melds.

18:36.408 --> 18:39.161
We take great pride in our ability
to contain emotions.

18:39.288 --> 18:40.846
Sharing them is offensive.

18:40.968 --> 18:42.845
If you'll excuse me,
we have a great deal...

18:42.968 --> 18:44.765
of work to do
before the conference ends.

18:44.888 --> 18:47.004
If you're not going to help her...

18:47.128 --> 18:49.926
the least you could do
is show a little discretion.

18:50.048 --> 18:52.801
The High Command doesn't need
to know about this.

18:52.928 --> 18:55.806
It's not for us to decide
what the High Command needs to know.

18:55.928 --> 18:57.919
You have her genetic profile.

18:58.048 --> 19:00.562
You must realise
she's not a member of this minority.

19:00.688 --> 19:04.078
Nonetheless, there's only one way
to contract Pa'nar Syndrome.

19:04.208 --> 19:05.436
Good day.

19:27.848 --> 19:28.883
Yes?

19:29.008 --> 19:32.159
There's a message for you
coming from the surface.

19:33.248 --> 19:35.762
- Transfer it here.
- Right away.

19:42.088 --> 19:43.282
Come in.

19:50.688 --> 19:54.317
I was just about to call you. Sit down.

20:04.408 --> 20:08.845
I'm sorry.
I didn't have much luck down there.

20:09.688 --> 20:13.283
They seem pretty pig-headed...

20:13.768 --> 20:15.406
when it comes to Pa'nar Syndrome.

20:17.008 --> 20:21.559
And I got the distinct feeling they're
not going to keep this to themselves.

20:21.848 --> 20:24.157
I just received a message
from Dr. Yuris.

20:26.088 --> 20:28.318
- Which one is he?
- The youngest.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.803
He asked me to meet him
in a northern section of the city.

20:38.048 --> 20:41.006
- I believe he wants to help.
- Help?

20:43.008 --> 20:45.966
That seems like the last thing
these doctors want to do.

20:46.088 --> 20:48.079
He asked me to come alone.

21:06.568 --> 21:08.001
Subcommander.

21:16.328 --> 21:18.319
This may be of use to you.

21:19.288 --> 21:22.405
- What is it?
- The research your doctor asked for.

21:28.248 --> 21:30.637
You've taken a great risk
by bringing this to me.

21:30.768 --> 21:33.077
One that I'm more than willing to take.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.243
Why?

21:34.528 --> 21:38.407
There's more intolerance today
than there was 1,000 years ago.

21:38.808 --> 21:40.287
It has to stop.

21:41.088 --> 21:44.524
Why jeopardise your career
to help someone you despise?

21:44.688 --> 21:47.839
If I despised you,
I'd be despising myself.

21:50.328 --> 21:52.284
I'm part of the minority.

22:01.968 --> 22:04.721
You know I'm not a member
of the minority.

22:04.968 --> 22:08.085
As far as my colleagues are concerned,
you might as well be.

22:08.208 --> 22:12.121
Anyone who chooses to perform
a mind-meld is worthy of contempt.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.119
What if I didn't choose?

22:19.128 --> 22:20.720
You were coerced.

22:22.328 --> 22:25.365
You should tell them.
They'll be far more sympathetic.

22:26.728 --> 22:29.083
- Are you infected?
- No.

22:29.768 --> 22:31.918
Only a small percentage are.

22:35.088 --> 22:39.047
If they ask my opinion,
I won't be able to condone what you did.

22:39.248 --> 22:42.957
- I hope you understand.
- You can't jeopardise your position.

22:44.008 --> 22:47.444
I have to return.
Tell them what happened.

22:48.288 --> 22:51.280
Tell them before they contact
the High Command.

22:52.768 --> 22:54.440
Thank you for this.

22:59.968 --> 23:02.243
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Why not?

23:02.368 --> 23:03.881
We're orbiting an alien world...

23:04.008 --> 23:06.283
and most of the crew are free
to go down and visit.

23:06.408 --> 23:09.320
Why would anyone want to stay
on board and watch a movie?

23:09.448 --> 23:12.360
Are you kidding?
They're showing The Black Cat.

23:12.488 --> 23:14.683
Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi.

23:14.888 --> 23:17.243
It sounds like you're the one
picking the movies.

23:17.368 --> 23:18.403
Me?

23:18.568 --> 23:22.243
Who else would choose
an obscure horror film?

23:22.528 --> 23:25.998
Why not something a little more,
I don't know, romantic?

23:26.448 --> 23:28.325
I'm going down to the surface.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.962
What's the rush?
You haven't even finished your dinner.

23:31.088 --> 23:32.885
There's a shuttle leaving at 1800 hours.

23:33.008 --> 23:34.999
You've got plenty of time.

23:35.208 --> 23:37.927
Try the cobbler.
The chef outdid himself.

23:39.768 --> 23:41.918
Okay, but I have to leave
in a few minutes.

23:42.048 --> 23:43.037
May I join you?

23:43.168 --> 23:46.683
Please. I'm Hoshi Sato.
I've been meaning to introduce myself.

23:46.808 --> 23:49.720
Feezal Phlox.
You're the language wizard.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.356
My husband speaks very fondly of you.

24:01.008 --> 24:04.000
I'm getting a little paranoid here.
You're not talking about me?

24:04.128 --> 24:06.084
Matter of fact, we were.

24:07.408 --> 24:09.797
Ens. Sato barely has an accent.

24:09.968 --> 24:12.687
She was telling me how attractive
she thinks you are.

24:12.808 --> 24:15.641
She's pulling your leg, sir.
I was only talking about grammar.

24:15.768 --> 24:17.360
It's okay, Hoshi.

24:17.688 --> 24:20.202
I've got to go.
It was very nice to meet you.

24:21.848 --> 24:24.806
I wasn't exactly pulling your leg, was I?

24:27.288 --> 24:29.324
No, not exactly.

24:30.648 --> 24:31.876
Look.

24:34.128 --> 24:37.962
I'm very flattered,
but aren't you a married woman?

24:38.168 --> 24:41.763
I'm a woman.
That's all that matters, isn't it?

24:44.568 --> 24:46.798
I'm afraid I've got to go, too.

24:46.928 --> 24:50.398
Captain asked me to write
a synopsis of tonight's movie.

24:50.528 --> 24:51.847
Save me a seat.

24:52.048 --> 24:56.246
You probably wouldn't like it.
It's very scary, and you've got to...

24:57.568 --> 24:59.638
You got to be human
to appreciate horror films.

24:59.768 --> 25:00.996
I'll see you in the morning.

25:12.648 --> 25:14.001
She's at it again.

25:14.848 --> 25:17.806
I don't know about you,
but I find her quite attractive.

25:17.928 --> 25:22.763
Come on, Malcolm. This is serious.
What if Phlox finds out?

25:23.008 --> 25:25.761
You haven't done anything
to make her think that you...

25:25.888 --> 25:27.037
Of course not!

25:28.288 --> 25:30.802
- Maybe I should tell the Doc.
- Tell him what?

25:31.008 --> 25:34.318
That his wife is trying to seduce you?
Not a good idea.

25:34.448 --> 25:38.726
I've got to spend the next two days
with her working on the microscope.

25:39.808 --> 25:41.958
I really think I should speak to Phlox.

25:42.088 --> 25:45.558
It might be a lot easier to avoid
her advances than get Phlox angry.

25:45.688 --> 25:49.397
I once saw him lose his temper
when one of his creatures bit him.

25:49.808 --> 25:51.764
It wasn't a pretty sight.

25:55.288 --> 25:56.960
This is far from a cure...

25:57.088 --> 26:00.319
but it should slow down the progression
of the disease.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.202
It's surprising. I assumed
your Science Directorate...

26:03.328 --> 26:05.080
would have made
more progress than this.

26:05.208 --> 26:08.644
As we've seen, they're
not very motivated to develop a cure.

26:09.128 --> 26:12.518
With this research, I should be able
to get closer than they have.

26:15.688 --> 26:17.326
How useful is it?

26:17.488 --> 26:19.638
Very. It will allow me to improve...

26:19.768 --> 26:22.919
my course of treatment
long before her symptoms get worse.

26:24.528 --> 26:27.281
Have you figured out
why Dr. Yuris gave it to you?

26:28.448 --> 26:29.881
No, I haven't.

26:35.648 --> 26:38.367
- You spoke with them.
- A few minutes ago.

26:43.088 --> 26:45.283
They've decided to recall you.

26:48.128 --> 26:51.757
- Do they have the authority to do that?
- Dr. Oratt does.

26:52.688 --> 26:55.521
He's a ranking member
of the Council of Physicians.

26:56.008 --> 27:00.126
They plan on taking you back to Vulcan
when the conference is over.

27:01.848 --> 27:05.807
- Have they notified the High Command?
- Not till you reach Vulcan.

27:10.568 --> 27:12.798
You've got to tell them, T'Pol.

27:13.848 --> 27:15.520
Tell them what happened.

27:15.648 --> 27:18.720
They won't do a thing to you
once they know it wasn't voluntary...

27:18.848 --> 27:20.679
that he did it against your will.

27:20.808 --> 27:22.560
- I won't do that.
- Why the hell not?

27:22.688 --> 27:24.246
I have Pa'nar Syndrome.

27:24.408 --> 27:26.603
It doesn't make a difference
how I contracted it.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.801
It makes a lot of difference.
You're not a member of this minority.

27:30.928 --> 27:33.442
He forced himself on you.
You said it yourself.

27:33.568 --> 27:36.287
He's right, T'Pol. You should tell them.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.047
He is not right.

27:39.808 --> 27:40.957
If I use that as a defence...

27:41.088 --> 27:43.682
as a way to keep
from being taken off Enterprise...

27:43.808 --> 27:45.480
I'd be condoning their prejudice...

27:45.608 --> 27:49.237
and in the process,
indicting every member of the minority.

27:50.128 --> 27:51.686
I won't do that.

28:03.688 --> 28:06.156
- Where's Oratt?
- Dr. Oratt isn't available.

28:06.288 --> 28:09.121
- Perhaps I can help you.
- Perhaps you can't.

28:17.248 --> 28:20.684
- You're going to have to leave.
- I need to talk to you!

28:23.488 --> 28:27.117
- I told him you were busy.
- What can I do for you, Captain?

28:29.128 --> 28:31.278
You have no right to take
my science officer.

28:31.408 --> 28:32.921
You're mistaken. I have every right.

28:33.048 --> 28:33.248
You can't dismiss someone
because you don't agree...

28:33.248 --> 28:35.284
You can't dismiss someone
because you don't agree...

28:35.408 --> 28:37.444
with the way they conduct
their personal lives.

28:37.568 --> 28:40.878
I am not dismissing T'Pol.
I'm simply returning her to Vulcan.

28:41.008 --> 28:43.647
The High Command will decide
whether she is fit for duty.

28:43.768 --> 28:44.803
Fit?

28:46.888 --> 28:50.847
You're saying a single mind-meld
is enough to destroy her career?

28:54.128 --> 28:56.881
Or is it that she contracted the disease?

28:58.808 --> 29:02.323
That's why you're so hesitant
to find a cure, isn't it?

29:02.488 --> 29:05.480
Why bother to help people
you don't approve of?

29:06.448 --> 29:10.282
I'm sorry you don't understand
the complexities of our culture, Captain.

29:11.008 --> 29:13.761
Please have the Subcommander ready
to depart in 36 hours.

29:13.888 --> 29:15.241
Not so fast.

29:17.448 --> 29:19.916
You know what this is, Doctor?

29:20.088 --> 29:23.319
My communications officer got it
from the Vulcan database.

29:23.448 --> 29:26.520
It's the protocols
of the Council of Physicians.

29:27.288 --> 29:29.961
It says that anyone accused
of ethical misconduct...

29:30.088 --> 29:33.478
is entitled to a hearing
"before the ranking medical officer...

29:33.608 --> 29:37.487
"in the province or territory where
the accusation was first made."

29:37.608 --> 29:39.724
If I'm not mistaken, that would be you.

29:39.848 --> 29:43.079
The accusation against T'Pol stands.
It's not open for debate.

29:43.208 --> 29:45.438
Where I come from,
everything's open for debate.

29:45.568 --> 29:47.479
And if I read these protocols correctly...

29:47.608 --> 29:50.281
so is the accusation you made
against my science officer.

29:50.408 --> 29:53.400
- You're wasting your time.
- It's mine to waste.

29:54.408 --> 29:57.923
Very well.
But I will not delay our departure.

29:58.888 --> 30:01.243
The hearing will take place
tomorrow afternoon.

30:01.368 --> 30:03.643
Tomorrow afternoon. Fine.

30:11.688 --> 30:13.724
It's the Dekendi's favourite sport.

30:13.848 --> 30:17.204
Just because they asked you
to participate, doesn't mean you had to.

30:17.328 --> 30:20.479
They said it was an honour.
It looked easy enough.

30:20.768 --> 30:24.078
You're lucky this creature
didn't strike a bit lower.

30:24.408 --> 30:28.037
If I may ask,
what is the purpose of this sport?

30:28.768 --> 30:32.204
They've got these fargans.
They're kind of like cows with humps...

30:32.328 --> 30:34.125
and they love melons.

30:34.328 --> 30:36.205
I think they're melons.

30:36.448 --> 30:39.520
So four guys get into
this big circle filled with fargans...

30:39.648 --> 30:41.479
and throw these melons back and forth.

30:41.608 --> 30:44.076
They use sticks
with metal baskets at the end.

30:44.208 --> 30:46.563
Do you play "monkey in the middle"
on Denobula?

30:46.688 --> 30:48.360
I don't believe so.

30:48.568 --> 30:52.117
Anyway, after a while, the fargans
start figuring out what's going on...

30:52.248 --> 30:53.761
Got a minute, Doc?

30:54.088 --> 30:55.806
Are you not feeling well, Commander?

30:55.928 --> 30:58.442
No, I'm fine. I just...

30:59.128 --> 31:00.880
I need to talk to you for a minute.

31:01.008 --> 31:03.397
By all means. What's on your mind?

31:04.128 --> 31:07.723
Actually, I was kind of hoping
to talk to you alone.

31:09.408 --> 31:11.205
I think we're about done here.

31:11.328 --> 31:14.206
It would be best if you avoided fargans
for a few days.

31:14.328 --> 31:15.443
Thanks, Doc.

31:17.008 --> 31:19.158
- Commander.
- See you, Travis.

31:23.728 --> 31:26.765
Malcolm said this was a bad idea...

31:27.288 --> 31:30.325
but I think it's the right thing to do.

31:30.608 --> 31:31.677
What's that?

31:31.808 --> 31:35.437
Feezal, I mean Mrs. Phlox...

31:36.288 --> 31:40.406
is a lovely woman, and she's very smart.

31:40.648 --> 31:44.436
She knows more about quantum optics
than anyone I've ever met.

31:45.208 --> 31:50.157
- She is remarkable.
- Remarkable, yeah, she sure is.

31:52.208 --> 31:54.164
Was there something else?

31:54.888 --> 31:57.083
Yeah, there is.

31:58.168 --> 32:00.602
You've got to understand,
I've been a perfect gentleman.

32:00.728 --> 32:02.958
Absolutely nothing's happened.

32:04.608 --> 32:06.280
She's trying to...

32:08.808 --> 32:10.400
She's...

32:12.488 --> 32:15.207
making advances,
if you know what I mean?

32:16.248 --> 32:19.763
- Sexual advances?
- I'm afraid so.

32:21.288 --> 32:23.756
Has she offered to give you
a rose petal bath?

32:23.888 --> 32:25.526
No, nothing like that.

32:25.648 --> 32:27.240
Any man would be a fool to ignore...

32:27.368 --> 32:30.644
the romantic overtures
of a healthy Denobulan woman.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.603
Don't you find her attractive?

32:33.968 --> 32:38.041
Sure. I mean, no, she's your wife.

32:38.208 --> 32:39.880
What does that have to do with it?

32:40.008 --> 32:42.283
- She's your wife?
- Oh, nonsense.

32:42.408 --> 32:43.636
Nonsense!

32:43.768 --> 32:46.521
You're too concerned
with human morality.

32:46.648 --> 32:50.357
You wanted to learn about new cultures.
Isn't that why you joined Starfleet?

32:50.488 --> 32:51.637
Why, of course it is.

32:51.768 --> 32:55.647
I was brought up believing you don't
play around with another man's wife.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.368
I don't think I'm ever going to
change my mind about that.

32:59.488 --> 33:02.400
As you wish. Your loss.

33:11.808 --> 33:13.002
Come in.

33:25.568 --> 33:28.287
Lieutenant Reed told me
you went to the surface.

33:30.408 --> 33:32.160
I spoke to Dr. Oratt.

33:33.208 --> 33:36.723
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you
to try and talk me out of it.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.204
- I assume you were unsuccessful.
- Not exactly.

33:41.768 --> 33:45.124
Before I left, I got the medical protocols
from Hoshi.

33:45.248 --> 33:47.762
It seems they owe you a hearing.

33:49.048 --> 33:52.085
- They'll never agree.
- They already did.

33:54.008 --> 33:57.125
I have no interest
in challenging their decision.

33:58.168 --> 34:00.921
If you're not going to defend yourself...

34:01.088 --> 34:05.604
the least you can do is speak for
this minority you're so eager to protect.

34:06.168 --> 34:10.241
You said you didn't want to condone
the attitude of these doctors.

34:10.728 --> 34:13.003
Your silence would do just that.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.884
You need to understand...

34:18.328 --> 34:21.047
I won't tell them how I got the disease.

34:21.288 --> 34:23.199
I'll go along with that.

34:23.408 --> 34:27.161
I promise.
But you've got to understand...

34:28.208 --> 34:30.199
I'm not going to give you up
without a fight.

34:35.208 --> 34:39.246
The fact that she has Pa'nar Syndrome
is not the reason she's being recalled.

34:39.368 --> 34:42.804
No. It has to do with
how she got infected.

34:43.328 --> 34:45.523
A mind-meld, over a year ago.

34:45.848 --> 34:47.725
When it took place is not pertinent.

34:47.848 --> 34:51.362
So what you're saying
is that if a Vulcan...

34:52.527 --> 34:55.440
even an officer
in the Science Directorate...

34:56.808 --> 35:01.723
engages in this exchange of thoughts
and memories...

35:01.928 --> 35:03.725
they're condemned for it?

35:03.848 --> 35:05.759
As you've been told, Captain...

35:05.968 --> 35:08.687
mind-melds are practiced
by a subculture.

35:08.808 --> 35:13.245
Vulcans who have elected to conduct
themselves in an unacceptable manner.

35:13.408 --> 35:16.878
They haven't elected to do anything.
They're born with this ability.

35:17.008 --> 35:20.683
Exactly. They're genetic aberrations
who prey on people like you...

35:20.808 --> 35:24.278
people foolish enough to experiment
with abhorrent behaviour.

35:24.408 --> 35:29.277
"You humans are too volatile,
too irrational, too narrow-minded."

35:29.688 --> 35:33.124
That's what I heard for years,
from every Vulcan I met.

35:34.008 --> 35:37.967
But we don't hold a candle to you
when it comes to narrow-minded.

35:38.288 --> 35:40.643
We got rid of bigotry
nearly a century ago.

35:40.768 --> 35:44.283
We're not afraid of diversity.
We don't persecute it, we embrace it.

35:44.408 --> 35:47.002
If you call yourselves enlightened...

35:47.128 --> 35:50.916
you have to accept people
who are different than you are.

35:51.048 --> 35:53.562
This is pointless.
Our culture is governed by rules.

35:53.688 --> 35:55.201
We're not about to ignore them.

35:55.328 --> 35:58.126
There are no rules telling you
to oppress minorities.

35:58.248 --> 36:00.284
You'd rather let them spread
their infections.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.160
That's exactly why you're being recalled.

36:02.288 --> 36:04.279
No, I'm being recalled
because you're afraid...

36:04.408 --> 36:07.684
of anything that doesn't conform
to your idea of acceptable behaviour.

36:07.808 --> 36:10.402
Unfortunately, you don't know
what you're talking about.

36:10.528 --> 36:12.917
The decision has been made.
We should end this inquiry.

36:13.048 --> 36:15.482
She knows exactly
what she's talking about.

36:16.128 --> 36:18.119
Are you questioning our judgement?

36:18.248 --> 36:21.797
There is nothing abhorrent
about the way we lead our lives.

36:21.928 --> 36:22.963
We?

36:23.088 --> 36:25.886
There is no simple definition
of intimacy.

36:26.008 --> 36:29.478
Those of us capable of mind-melds
are no different than you are.

36:29.648 --> 36:32.799
You realise that you're jeopardising
your reputation, your career?

36:32.928 --> 36:37.126
We share our thoughts differently.
We shouldn't be punished for that.

36:37.408 --> 36:40.286
The High Command will determine
whether you should be punished.

36:40.408 --> 36:41.761
Both of you.

36:43.608 --> 36:46.998
She's not guilty of anything.
She was violated.

36:47.168 --> 36:48.999
You gave me your word.

36:49.128 --> 36:52.040
The mind-meld was performed
against her will.

36:52.488 --> 36:54.001
Can you verify this?

36:54.208 --> 36:57.006
Why? So you can perpetuate
your double standard?

36:57.128 --> 36:59.244
Condemn the infected
when they meld by choice...

36:59.368 --> 37:01.723
and sympathise with them
when they don't?

37:02.448 --> 37:04.484
What do you know of this, Captain?

37:06.368 --> 37:09.246
Seems my science officer
doesn't want to discuss it.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.320
That's good enough for me.

37:12.448 --> 37:15.918
She told me herself.
She made me promise to stay silent.

37:17.968 --> 37:21.358
I'm sorry. I had to tell them the truth.

37:22.328 --> 37:24.205
You should do the same.

37:25.848 --> 37:28.043
I have nothing to say to them.

37:34.168 --> 37:36.636
Feezal tells me it can be
quite temperamental.

37:36.768 --> 37:38.326
I think I've got it figured out.

37:38.448 --> 37:40.325
Just let me know when
it starts acting up.

37:40.448 --> 37:42.837
Have you got
the activation sequence down?

37:44.088 --> 37:45.407
My beloved.

37:50.448 --> 37:53.520
I certainly hope it's not another
four years until I see you again.

37:53.648 --> 37:54.683
So do I.

37:54.808 --> 37:57.720
But remember, your other wives
are anxious to see you, too.

37:57.848 --> 37:58.883
Commander Tucker assures me...

37:59.008 --> 38:02.000
he'll keep your beautiful microscope
in perfect running order.

38:02.128 --> 38:03.925
As his doctor, I hope you'll keep...

38:04.048 --> 38:05.879
Commander Tucker
in perfect running order.

38:06.008 --> 38:09.080
Perhaps that'll motivate me
to visit more often.

38:09.408 --> 38:12.559
It's a shame you two didn't get
to know each other better.

38:12.968 --> 38:16.404
Well, I've got to get back
to my warp engine.

38:16.648 --> 38:19.606
The plasma's running a little hot.

38:19.768 --> 38:21.520
I know how it feels.

38:25.208 --> 38:26.960
Pleasure meeting you.

38:34.008 --> 38:35.157
Humans.

38:38.528 --> 38:39.517
Come in.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.325
Dr. Yuris has been suspended.

38:49.128 --> 38:51.039
That was to be expected.

38:52.048 --> 38:54.846
They offered him a hearing,
but he refused.

38:56.128 --> 38:59.006
Oratt said he'll lose his standing
with the Medical Exchange...

38:59.128 --> 39:01.323
when they get back to Vulcan.

39:01.688 --> 39:03.406
Also to be expected.

39:05.288 --> 39:08.644
One good thing did come out of this.

39:12.128 --> 39:15.359
They believed him when he said
you were forced.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.484
You're not going to be recalled.

39:28.248 --> 39:31.365
With your permission,
I'll be contacting the High Command.

39:31.488 --> 39:35.037
I don't intend to let Yuris
be dismissed without a fight.

39:36.368 --> 39:38.040
Permission granted.

39:40.528 --> 39:44.441
I know you must be very disappointed
that he broke his promise to you.

39:44.568 --> 39:48.004
But on a selfish note, I'm glad he did.

39:50.648 --> 39:52.206
I didn't want to lose you.

39:55.768 --> 39:59.204
Maybe this incident will encourage
others to speak out.

40:03.848 --> 40:05.281
Let's hope so.
