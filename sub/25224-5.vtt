01:41.000 --> 01:44.199
Time was 2.40.54am.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.439
OK, and if you would, please,

01:45.440 --> 01:46.839
go ahead and describe to the jury

01:46.840 --> 01:48.838
what you did as it related to

01:48.839 --> 01:51.758
the call that you
received at that time.

01:51.759 --> 01:55.078
I answered a 911 call from
a man who stated that there was

01:55.079 --> 01:56.998
an accident at his house.

01:56.999 --> 01:58.998
And I asked him what kind
of accident,

01:58.999 --> 02:01.597
he said his wife had fallen
down some steps.

02:01.598 --> 02:04.797
I asked him at that time if she was
breathing and he said yes.

02:04.798 --> 02:08.237
I then asked him how many steps
she fell down. He said,

02:08.238 --> 02:11.397
"I don't know", and I asked him
again, and he said, "15 or 20."

02:11.398 --> 02:14.117
He was doing some crying and stuff
in the background,

02:14.118 --> 02:16.756
and then I asked him again,
"Sir, is she still breathing?"

02:16.757 --> 02:20.517
And he said, "Yes",
and he eventually disconnected. OK.

02:21.917 --> 02:24.316
I take it over the course
of five years you've answered

02:24.317 --> 02:27.356
lots of 911 calls.
Yes, of course.

02:27.357 --> 02:31.235
And heard lots of different people
asking for help. Yes.

02:31.236 --> 02:34.555
And heard people who call up calm,

02:34.556 --> 02:37.635
people who call up excited
and everything in between.

02:37.636 --> 02:39.475
Yes.

02:39.476 --> 02:44.714
And the way you described
Mr Peterson on that tape...

02:44.715 --> 02:46.475
Objection.

02:49.355 --> 02:53.234
Overruled.
..was as hysterical, right?

02:53.235 --> 02:57.593
Very upset, yes. Well, you actually
said hysterical. Hysterical.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.434
Indeed, that's what you put on
that CAD form. Yes.

03:02.394 --> 03:08.193
Cos that's how he struck you? Yes.
That's all I have, thank you, ma'am.

03:08.194 --> 03:11.632
You have no way of knowing whether
he was feigning

03:11.633 --> 03:17.512
all those actions and noises on
his end of the phone call, do you?

03:17.513 --> 03:19.753
No, sir. No other questions.

04:46.586 --> 04:49.985
Now, we hear the dial tone,

04:49.986 --> 04:52.785
and I think we show that
in the transcript...

04:52.786 --> 04:55.425
on two occasions.
What does that mean?

04:55.426 --> 04:58.784
It would mean that the call was
terminated. On which side?

04:58.785 --> 05:00.544
It would be on the caller's side.

05:00.545 --> 05:03.025
OK. Your Honour, I have
no other questions.

05:07.865 --> 05:11.024
The Arrival of the Queen
of Sheba by Handel

05:27.743 --> 05:33.863
This is the other piece I wanted to
play at the, eh... At the funeral.

05:37.222 --> 05:39.782
It's just a wonderful piece
of music.

05:41.262 --> 05:42.662
Invitation to the Dance.

06:02.381 --> 06:03.621
Everything.

06:05.340 --> 06:08.059
Margaret, Martha, you guys...

06:08.060 --> 06:12.779
Everybody involved, it's just awful.

06:12.780 --> 06:17.819
Awful! As if the death wasn't
enough, and all the rest of it.

06:19.619 --> 06:22.658
But that's when I channel it
into other things.

06:22.659 --> 06:24.858
Yeah, distract yourself and...
Mm-hmm.

06:24.859 --> 06:28.218
And you're always doing things,
busy. Yes.

06:28.219 --> 06:31.817
A great deal of selfishness and ego
goes away with age.

06:31.818 --> 06:33.257
You can't help it.

06:33.258 --> 06:37.257
You watch yourself get old and ugly
and fat and stupid.

06:37.258 --> 06:41.338
The ego declines. It should, anyway.

06:43.618 --> 06:46.936
And so you worry more about
other things, other people.

06:46.937 --> 06:49.776
The ones you love. The dogs!

06:49.777 --> 06:52.416
HE CHUCKLES

06:52.417 --> 06:58.375
I'm mostly just worried about,
you know, how you're doing. I know.

06:58.376 --> 07:02.575
And yeah, mostly just coping with
everything. I cope pretty well.

07:02.576 --> 07:04.415
Where's my lighter here?

07:04.416 --> 07:07.735
Yeah, well, you haven't got any
choice, it's one of those things.

07:07.736 --> 07:09.295
That's what I've always believed.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.175
Can't do anything about it,
why worry about it?

07:13.415 --> 07:15.614
Which is, you know,
pretty much how Kathleen felt,

07:15.615 --> 07:18.694
and what we're trying to get
Becky to feel.

07:18.695 --> 07:21.654
Hey, if you can't do anything...
Can't do a fucking thing about it.

07:21.655 --> 07:24.254
Fuck it, don't worry about it.
Can't change anything.

07:24.255 --> 07:26.613
It's like worrying about... anything.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.693
Gee, I mean,
worry about dying - well, don't,

07:29.694 --> 07:32.173
because you're going to die!

07:32.174 --> 07:35.214
So what's the point in
thinking about it?

07:40.373 --> 07:44.172
No, I think I cope pretty well
with it.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.412
You going to be all right?
MICHAEL SIGHS/TODD LAUGHS

07:46.413 --> 07:50.172
Yes, I'm going to be fine,
thank you very much.

07:50.173 --> 07:52.411
Jesus! Sorry, Dad.

07:52.412 --> 07:56.211
The more you worry about me,
the more worried I get! Stop it.

07:56.212 --> 07:59.651
Well, you know...
Let me worry about you, hm?

07:59.652 --> 08:01.292
God.
HE LAUGHS

08:02.932 --> 08:04.532
Hm?

08:26.450 --> 08:29.009
Those appear to be the shorts
Mr Peterson had on the night...

08:29.010 --> 08:31.330
The front and the back... Yes, sir.

08:44.049 --> 08:45.967
At this point
we'd move into evidence

08:45.968 --> 08:47.768
what's marked State's Exhibit 4A.

08:53.168 --> 08:56.207
The victim was dressed in sweats.

08:56.208 --> 08:59.047
She had on a sweatshirt
and sweatpants.

08:59.048 --> 09:00.406
I observed that, again,

09:00.407 --> 09:04.126
what appeared to be large quantities
of blood all over the floor,

09:04.127 --> 09:07.686
all over the victim, her hands,
feet, her clothing,

09:07.687 --> 09:12.366
the walls, there were paper towels
around the body and there was

09:12.367 --> 09:13.845
a towel under her head.

09:13.846 --> 09:19.005
What was the condition of the blood
on the floor? It was dry. OK.

09:19.006 --> 09:22.525
Could you tell what the condition of
the blood was on the stairs?

09:22.526 --> 09:24.645
It was dry.

09:24.646 --> 09:27.284
What was the condition of the blood
on the walls of the stairway,

09:27.285 --> 09:30.164
if you could see that?
It appeared to be dry.

09:30.165 --> 09:32.524
It appeared to have been either
wiped or smeared.

09:32.525 --> 09:34.084
The first thing that came to me,

09:34.085 --> 09:36.884
with the amount of
training I've had,

09:36.885 --> 09:39.723
from what I observed in
the stairwell, this did not

09:39.724 --> 09:43.564
appear to be what I would have
considered a fall down the steps.

09:45.404 --> 09:46.883
Mr George, I want you to come down,

09:46.884 --> 09:48.563
I don't want you
to narrate anything,

09:48.564 --> 09:50.884
I just want you to look at
the videotape.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.202
You actually made the videotape?

09:57.203 --> 10:01.123
Yes, this is a copy of the videotape
I made the evening of the 9th.

10:54.199 --> 10:55.239
See ya.

11:06.318 --> 11:09.477
Well, let me talk about that issue
a little bit, you have all

11:09.478 --> 11:12.917
this testimony from these officers
saying the blood appeared dry.

11:12.918 --> 11:15.876
None of them touched the blood,
they said it appeared dry.

11:15.877 --> 11:17.436
Yet, on cross-examination,

11:17.437 --> 11:21.436
they all agreed that they didn't put
any of that in their report.

11:21.437 --> 11:25.276
What we really need in this case
are the experts to tell us how long

11:25.277 --> 11:26.796
does it take for blood to dry,

11:26.797 --> 11:29.635
how long does it take for it
to dry on plaster,

11:29.636 --> 11:32.835
how long does it take for it to dry
on wood, and how long does it take

11:32.836 --> 11:37.955
for a pool of blood versus a spatter
of blood versus a cast-off stain?

11:37.956 --> 11:40.075
These are... OK.

11:40.076 --> 11:42.995
TRAIN HORN BLASTS

11:47.715 --> 11:50.434
You know, when I look at what
we can get out of George,

11:50.435 --> 11:57.033
it seems to me that whatever
I can do to establish

11:57.034 --> 12:02.593
that there have been changes
in the scene, wherever they are,

12:02.594 --> 12:03.913
changes in the blood,

12:03.914 --> 12:06.873
changes in the things
that have blood on them...

12:06.874 --> 12:12.192
once we do that, then it's not
a very big jump to the fact

12:12.193 --> 12:16.872
that nothing in that stairway
can be relied upon.

12:16.873 --> 12:21.591
And there's a great quote from
Epstein's blood spatter...

12:21.592 --> 12:24.431
Actually, it's from
the North Carolina

12:24.432 --> 12:28.511
Justice Academy Blood Spatter
Interpretation Manual.

12:28.512 --> 12:32.111
"It is vital that the crime scene be
preserved in absolutely

12:32.112 --> 12:33.511
"its original condition

12:33.512 --> 12:38.150
"whenever any blood stain pattern
interpretation is to be done.

12:38.151 --> 12:40.950
"Even the movement of
a single blood-stained object in

12:40.951 --> 12:44.630
"the scene can significantly affect
the interpretation

12:44.631 --> 12:47.470
"of the spatter patterns."

12:47.471 --> 12:50.749
And then I thought I'd get into...

12:50.750 --> 12:53.349
some of these photos.
And that's where we'd get into...

12:53.350 --> 12:55.269
The photos where there's
differences,

12:55.270 --> 12:57.429
not the direction of blood
spatter photos?

12:57.430 --> 12:59.469
No, not the direction of
blood spatter stuff.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.029
Well, we know that it happened...

13:01.030 --> 13:03.148
We know the pictures were
taken by the 10th.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.708
And some of them were taken
on the 9th,

13:04.709 --> 13:07.588
because they actually have the date
on them. Right. So, for example...

13:07.589 --> 13:09.748
We've got the photo next
to the oven,

13:09.749 --> 13:12.228
and there's actually two things
changed about that.

13:12.229 --> 13:14.748
A drop disappears and another
drop is added. Right.

13:14.749 --> 13:16.707
You know, what I love is that
these two pictures

13:16.708 --> 13:19.387
don't have any date on them.

13:19.388 --> 13:23.507
They have no date.
So when were these taken?

13:23.508 --> 13:26.027
That's what we'll start with.

13:26.028 --> 13:30.786
This is a picture right here of
the area right by the sink, right?

13:30.787 --> 13:33.107
And can we go to the next photo?

13:34.467 --> 13:39.626
That's a close-up of the same area,
is it not? Yes, it is. All right.

13:39.627 --> 13:42.465
Now, what we have here is
a side-by-side comparison

13:42.466 --> 13:44.825
of those two areas, you see that?
I do.

13:44.826 --> 13:48.026
You see that little spot
right there? Yes, sir, I do.

13:49.826 --> 13:53.825
That's not there, is it?
No, it isn't. Do you know why?

13:53.826 --> 13:57.304
During our processing, if you also
notice right in the centre

13:57.305 --> 14:01.064
of the picture on the right, there
is a little stain there also.

14:01.065 --> 14:02.384
That one? Yes, sir.

14:02.385 --> 14:04.664
And that's missing on there. Right.

14:04.665 --> 14:09.304
So on each photo you have a stain
that's not on the other photo.

14:09.305 --> 14:11.703
I was explaining that when those
photos were processed,

14:11.704 --> 14:15.103
that was part of
a photo glitch there in the centre.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.343
Photo glitch? That was in
the processing,

14:17.344 --> 14:19.463
something happened
in the processing.

14:19.464 --> 14:23.542
So that's not really
a blood stain there? No, sir, it is.

14:23.543 --> 14:27.582
How would someone looking at that
know that? They wouldn't.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.822
Did you note it anywhere?

14:29.823 --> 14:34.783
No, sir. And that's a glitch too?
I don't really know.

14:36.103 --> 14:39.541
Well, you don't...?
I did not process those pictures.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.901
Well, how do you know this is
a glitch then?

14:41.902 --> 14:45.142
I was explained that later on.
Who explained that to you?

14:47.662 --> 14:49.661
I don't really recall
who did it right now.

14:49.662 --> 14:53.740
Do you know how many glitches
there are in the photos? No, sir.

14:53.741 --> 14:56.700
That's the only two
that I've observed.

14:56.701 --> 15:03.260
Ron found a number of photos
where there are

15:03.261 --> 15:07.819
really small differences,
but very significant differences.

15:07.820 --> 15:14.259
Uh, between two photos taken of the
same object by the police, at a time

15:14.260 --> 15:19.338
when Michael Peterson was in
a den somewhere under police watch

15:19.339 --> 15:20.778
or else out of the house.

15:20.779 --> 15:26.378
Their experts look at things like
this, these things with

15:26.379 --> 15:29.738
numbers here, and they say,
"Well, you see,

15:29.739 --> 15:32.577
"that's a skeletonised
blood stain.

15:32.578 --> 15:35.337
"That means someone tried
to clean up this area,

15:35.338 --> 15:38.737
"and what happened was the blood
stain was very dry

15:38.738 --> 15:42.537
"on the outer ring,
cos that's where it dries first,

15:42.538 --> 15:46.416
"and much less dry in the middle,
and so when someone came through

15:46.417 --> 15:50.776
"and tried to clean it,
all they wiped up was the middle."

15:50.777 --> 15:55.576
Well then,
when you go back to another photo -

15:55.577 --> 16:00.215
and both of these were taken
on 12/9, the same day -

16:00.216 --> 16:03.615
and you look at these
same blood stains,

16:03.616 --> 16:05.256
they're completely filled in.

16:06.616 --> 16:09.055
And so to the extent
their expert is saying,

16:09.056 --> 16:11.814
"Oh, there was clean-up here,"

16:11.815 --> 16:14.974
well, if there was clean-up,
it was clean-up by the police,

16:14.975 --> 16:16.415
not by Michael Peterson.

16:17.775 --> 16:22.654
And that's the kind of thing I think
that really creates questions

16:22.655 --> 16:25.453
in the minds of the jurors.

16:25.454 --> 16:28.533
Would you want to bet your own life
on the competence

16:28.534 --> 16:32.453
of Dan George and the Durham
crime scene investigators?

16:32.454 --> 16:35.613
Because if you wouldn't want to bet
your own life on them,

16:35.614 --> 16:38.332
then don't bet
Michael Peterson's life.

16:38.333 --> 16:42.052
See that area right there?
Yes, sir. Let's blow that up.

16:42.053 --> 16:44.732
That's that area, right?
It appears to be, yes, sir.

16:44.733 --> 16:50.052
And you see there's sort of a
skeletonised series of blood stains?

16:50.053 --> 16:51.251
I see that, yes, sir.

16:51.252 --> 16:55.691
All right, let's take a look at
another photo of that same step.

16:55.692 --> 17:00.251
Now, if we look at the area here and
compare it with the area here,

17:00.252 --> 17:01.971
there are some differences,

17:01.972 --> 17:03.451
aren't there?

17:03.452 --> 17:05.609
It is. For example,

17:05.611 --> 17:09.050
that one right there is
skeletonised,

17:09.050 --> 17:11.890
that one right there is full,
that's partially...

17:11.891 --> 17:13.609
Hold on, Tom.

17:13.611 --> 17:17.970
That's partially skeletonised and
that's full, right? Yes, sir.

17:17.971 --> 17:21.368
And the police took both of
these photos, right?

17:21.369 --> 17:22.888
That's correct.

17:22.890 --> 17:26.848
Mr Peterson wasn't in the stairway
doing anything

17:26.849 --> 17:29.609
between the taking
of these photos, right?

17:29.610 --> 17:32.128
No. Do you know which photo
was taken first?

17:32.129 --> 17:33.888
I do not.

17:33.889 --> 17:37.208
Well, do you have an explanation
for why they're different?

17:37.209 --> 17:39.808
I don't have an explanation for it.

17:39.809 --> 17:43.648
Are you thinking that
that's a glitch? No, sir.

17:43.649 --> 17:48.927
This is contamination
in the crime scene, right?

17:48.928 --> 17:52.927
And there you see Rudolf continuing
his attack on the witness,

17:52.928 --> 17:54.847
who is basically helping the state

17:54.848 --> 17:56.767
support the integrity
of that crime scene.

17:56.768 --> 17:59.166
Do you have a question for Jean
about the crime scene?

17:59.167 --> 18:02.966
I did, I'm still bothered by
the fact that there were footprints,

18:02.967 --> 18:07.446
I believe, in the kitchen,
and the blood had been cleaned up,

18:07.447 --> 18:09.926
and I still have not
seen an explanation

18:09.927 --> 18:12.086
of when they were cleaned and why.

18:12.087 --> 18:15.525
Jean, before we go to break, I want
to ask you another question -

18:15.526 --> 18:20.005
are you telling me that bloody
footprints were cleaned up... What?

18:20.006 --> 18:22.765
..before the police arrived?

18:22.766 --> 18:26.084
I think we have to assume
at this point... What?!

18:26.085 --> 18:28.644
..the prosecution is going to say
they were cleaned up,

18:28.645 --> 18:31.484
but the defence is going to say
the defendant was hysterical

18:31.485 --> 18:33.604
and walking in circles
everywhere he went,

18:33.605 --> 18:37.044
and as you keep walking,
the blood on your feet is going to

18:37.045 --> 18:39.643
become fainter and fainter,
pretty soon it's not going to be...

18:39.644 --> 18:42.483
Well, forget about Nancy,
Jean is at least

18:42.484 --> 18:45.923
supposed to be
correcting things.

18:45.924 --> 18:48.163
Who? Who the fuck is...?

18:48.164 --> 18:52.683
Wait - who has said that anyone
washed the floor in the kitchen?

18:54.243 --> 18:59.562
If you washed the floor, there
wouldn't be any luminol footprints.

18:59.563 --> 19:01.243
Is she an idiot?!

19:03.163 --> 19:05.442
She says, "Oh, yeah,
we'll just have to wait and see,

19:05.443 --> 19:07.082
"that's what it sounds like."

19:16.242 --> 19:23.680
No, no. Because there wasn't any
wipe marks, or swipe marks.

19:23.681 --> 19:28.401
And the mop was tested,
and there was no blood.

19:31.401 --> 19:33.800
I mean, come on, you know...

19:34.840 --> 19:40.279
She's saying stuff there that,
it's just... I understand you want

19:40.280 --> 19:43.879
to pump the ratings or whatever,
but gimme a break. And I'm not

19:43.880 --> 19:46.638
fussing at you, I understand
you didn't have anything

19:46.639 --> 19:51.038
to do with it, but it's... you know,
if you are supposed to be informing

19:51.039 --> 19:55.438
the public about what's going on,
she ought to have her ass fired.

19:55.439 --> 19:58.238
It's just awful.
It's one thing,

19:58.239 --> 20:01.597
you sort of expect
it from Nancy Grace,

20:01.598 --> 20:04.557
but for the correspondent
who's sat in the court...

20:04.558 --> 20:08.117
It's like she didn't
see what happened today!

20:08.118 --> 20:10.158
COOKER CLICKS

20:12.598 --> 20:15.596
I can't believe they were trying
to say that Dad faked that

20:15.597 --> 20:20.276
911 call. Yeah, that was
the dumbest... Oh, my God.

20:20.277 --> 20:25.436
That really was dumb. That was
so stupid of Jim Hardin,

20:25.437 --> 20:27.635
to just sit there and say that.

20:27.636 --> 20:31.275
Especially that day, when you're
crying right there.

20:31.276 --> 20:36.395
I tried so hard not to cry too,
it was horrible... starting to cry

20:36.396 --> 20:39.995
and all of a sudden you feel
the cameras on you, it's like...

20:39.996 --> 20:42.275
I know, right? It's the money shot.

20:45.315 --> 20:48.554
Well, no, but even Caitlin cried at
the opening statement

20:48.555 --> 20:51.314
when Rudolf played the 911 tapes.

20:51.315 --> 20:54.153
And Caitlin just wasn't there
that day that Hardin...

20:54.154 --> 20:56.193
Oh, she wasn't there?
No, she wasn't there,

20:56.194 --> 20:58.193
she probably would have been
crying too.

20:58.194 --> 21:02.993
Did she cry in the opening
statement? Yeah. Well, I mean...

21:02.994 --> 21:07.712
Do you think it was like
an... indignation, is that the word?

21:07.713 --> 21:12.352
Indignant crying or whatever?
Or was it, like, she really felt...?

21:12.353 --> 21:15.432
I'm sure... It's just a terrible
situation for everybody.

21:15.433 --> 21:18.793
I'm sure everyone's tears are real.
That's what I thought.

21:25.872 --> 21:28.431
You know, if you do it
a tad second too long,

21:28.432 --> 21:30.711
you lose the perfection
of my special recipe.

21:30.712 --> 21:32.112
That right?

21:38.671 --> 21:41.390
Are you going to drink cranberry
juice or...? Yeah, cranberry juice.

21:41.391 --> 21:44.390
No wine? No. All right.
You going to drink a little

21:44.391 --> 21:46.110
champagne to toast yourself?

21:46.111 --> 21:49.869
I might have a little half
a glass. OK, all right.

21:49.870 --> 21:55.749
And this is of course to Bill...
For my birthday, really?

21:55.750 --> 21:58.349
Well, yes, but for
other reasons too.

21:58.350 --> 22:02.508
And there's a lesson here, and it's
for you guys, because I could not

22:02.509 --> 22:07.868
have gotten through this without
my brother, and I of course will

22:07.869 --> 22:12.188
be there for him soon, I suppose,
when he is incontinent and...

22:12.189 --> 22:13.708
LAUGHTER

22:13.709 --> 22:14.868
..slobbering.

22:14.869 --> 22:20.227
But it is a wonderful lesson
for you and your brother,

22:20.228 --> 22:26.387
and for your sisters and your
brothers. It goes to la famiglia.

22:26.388 --> 22:29.546
And to Bill. La famiglia! Hey, Dad,
when you're acquitted,

22:29.547 --> 22:31.866
you're going to come down
and visit me?

22:31.867 --> 22:35.666
I will come down right away.
Yay. Mm-hmm.

22:35.667 --> 22:39.307
Have you thought this through?
Wouldn't he be an embarrassment?

22:42.186 --> 22:45.825
Only two more months, right? All of
October, all of September,

22:45.826 --> 22:48.385
all of August...
They're saying October now.

22:48.386 --> 22:51.265
They're saying October now?
It's spilled over into October.

22:51.266 --> 22:53.466
Are you kidding me?
That's what Court TV says.

22:55.306 --> 22:59.104
But... We talked about that
last night, we'll be here for

22:59.105 --> 23:03.265
Halloween and we're going to have
Mike Peterson masks made out.

23:04.785 --> 23:08.744
"Give me your candy or
I'll shove you."

23:08.745 --> 23:11.464
Little blow pokes!

23:13.464 --> 23:15.264
You got it, Todd? Yeah.

23:16.544 --> 23:20.064
Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

23:25.663 --> 23:30.142
We got to get that. Margaret,
you can carry this.

23:30.143 --> 23:33.622
That's so wrong, just wait for
your next birthday, Dad.

23:33.623 --> 23:35.422
MICHAEL LAUGHS

23:35.423 --> 23:38.181
♪ Happy birthday to you

23:38.182 --> 23:42.621
♪ Happy birthday to you

23:42.622 --> 23:47.581
♪ Happy birthday, dear Bill

23:47.582 --> 23:52.260
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

23:52.261 --> 23:54.381
THEY APPLAUD

24:01.261 --> 24:05.979
Are you able to say or give this
jury a minimum number of

24:05.980 --> 24:09.139
blows that you contend would
have been inflicted

24:09.140 --> 24:12.579
to Miss Peterson to cause
what we see here?

24:12.580 --> 24:16.578
Yes. On the night that
I was at this scene,

24:16.579 --> 24:21.378
I gave Detective Holland
a minimum of four blows

24:21.379 --> 24:23.298
that occurred to the victim.

24:23.299 --> 24:29.378
The reason for that was that I found
three points of origin from impact.

24:29.379 --> 24:31.857
That means that the source of blood,
the back of the head,

24:31.858 --> 24:33.697
was struck three times.

24:33.698 --> 24:37.297
I add one to that because there
needs to be at least one blow

24:37.298 --> 24:39.817
that occurs to start bleeding.

24:39.818 --> 24:43.856
One of the points of origin
is 19 inches from step 17,

24:43.857 --> 24:48.376
8 inches up from the east wall, and
6 inches out from the north wall.

24:48.377 --> 24:51.576
At that point would her face have
been up or down?

24:51.577 --> 24:54.976
If the face were up,
out here in space,

24:54.977 --> 24:57.735
and something impacted
the head from the bottom,

24:57.736 --> 25:00.735
then the impact spatters are going
to go down on the floor and

25:00.736 --> 25:04.255
on the wall low,
below the head itself.

25:04.256 --> 25:07.095
Therefore, the source of blood,
the back of the head,

25:07.096 --> 25:12.374
is going to have to be up
and be impacted in space such that

25:12.375 --> 25:14.494
the blood spatters can go up
the walls

25:14.495 --> 25:18.134
and create the blood spatters
that you see in Paragraph E.

25:18.135 --> 25:22.494
You've got cast-off outside
on that header and on the west wall

25:22.495 --> 25:23.973
on the hallway.

25:23.974 --> 25:25.933
Exactly how could that happen?

25:25.934 --> 25:30.893
It would be my opinion that this
cast-off stain that created this,

25:30.894 --> 25:36.573
and this pattern on this wall, was
created at or about the same time

25:36.574 --> 25:40.772
that the impact over
step number 15 was created.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.892
It's my opinion that
the individual creating that

25:43.893 --> 25:47.612
was standing on the outside,
able to swing the weapon,

25:47.613 --> 25:52.211
creating this cast-off stain.

25:52.212 --> 25:55.851
My opinion is that this
is the scene of a beating,

25:55.852 --> 26:00.171
that this scene is not unlike
many scenes that I have been to,

26:00.172 --> 26:02.331
and the spatters,
the impact spatters,

26:02.332 --> 26:04.250
are like those consistent
with beatings

26:04.251 --> 26:05.651
that I have seen in the past.

26:08.131 --> 26:12.450
So they're putting blood on a sponge
on top of a mannequin's head.

26:12.451 --> 26:14.570
A lot of blood.

26:14.571 --> 26:17.810
OVERLAPPING VOICES

26:20.730 --> 26:23.810
It's a Styrofoam head
with a sponge on it.

26:25.450 --> 26:29.209
This is quite an impressive
scientific method, don't you think?

26:29.210 --> 26:33.128
The first group of experiments
is elimination. Yes, exactly.

26:33.129 --> 26:38.289
She cannot be accidental,
a fall, from two or three high.

26:43.569 --> 26:45.927
Now you see how much blood spatter.

26:45.928 --> 26:49.447
You actually see a fair amount
along the base there.

26:49.448 --> 26:53.607
They actually proved that you get
a fair amount of spatter low down!

26:53.608 --> 26:57.687
Then, of course, there's the piece
of skull that they don't pick up.

26:57.688 --> 27:02.366
I'd love to hear the audio.
Do they have an audio?

27:02.367 --> 27:04.766
He says, "Give me another sponge.

27:04.767 --> 27:07.446
"Here, let's put the sponge
down on the floor."

27:07.447 --> 27:10.046
So they put the sponge down
on the floor.

27:10.047 --> 27:11.925
"Now, let's beat it some more."

27:11.926 --> 27:12.966
Watch.

27:14.206 --> 27:16.925
One, two...

27:16.926 --> 27:19.046
Oh, broke.

27:20.406 --> 27:25.485
Three, four, five, six, seven.

27:28.765 --> 27:31.284
Eight, nine.

27:31.285 --> 27:34.365
They still don't have the spatter
the way they want it.

27:40.884 --> 27:44.243
CHUCKLING

27:44.244 --> 27:48.763
Hey, Tim.
Boy, these guys work late too, huh?

27:48.764 --> 27:50.603
We all work late.

27:50.604 --> 27:52.882
Hey, my friend.
Hi, buddy, how you doing?

27:52.883 --> 27:56.322
Good, nice to see you. You too, man.
How you hanging on? Good.

27:56.323 --> 27:58.963
Tom? Hey, you have a good trip?
Piece of cake.

28:02.483 --> 28:06.161
He worked from the end result
backwards. He basically wanted

28:06.162 --> 28:09.241
to recreate something.
He looked at the pictures!

28:09.242 --> 28:13.001
So his goal was,
"I need this end product.

28:13.002 --> 28:15.561
"What do I have to do to get there?"

28:15.562 --> 28:17.881
That's dead polar opposite
to good science.

28:17.882 --> 28:22.320
Good science says we don't care
what the end product is,

28:22.321 --> 28:25.600
it's all about developing through
data collection and conjecture

28:25.601 --> 28:30.320
a good hypothesis, and whatever
the outcome it is, it shows.

28:30.321 --> 28:31.600
It shows. It shows.

28:31.601 --> 28:36.319
When you do that, you need to say,
"Is there any other

28:36.320 --> 28:39.599
"hypothesis or explanation that
could have done this?"

28:39.600 --> 28:42.599
And if there is,
I must also test that.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.639
If Deaver should have done
any experiment,

28:44.640 --> 28:46.598
that's the one
he should have tried to do.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.758
The two points of origin are...

28:48.759 --> 28:53.078
He's trying to put it out in space,
you know? You just can't...

28:53.079 --> 28:57.798
You can't... It's an area, it's not
a point. That's absolutely right.

28:57.799 --> 29:01.837
So your area, one of them
was two inches, one was six.

29:01.838 --> 29:04.557
In a macroscopic view,
it's on the wall. Right.

29:04.558 --> 29:06.117
It's right there.

29:06.118 --> 29:08.357
You've got the impact
to the back of the head.

29:08.358 --> 29:13.516
How can you orientate that
so that it's two inches from there?

29:13.517 --> 29:16.956
Even if I take your head and I
physically hold it against there,

29:16.957 --> 29:21.156
physically hold it, you're still
more than two inches.

29:21.157 --> 29:23.236
Stop it right there.

29:23.237 --> 29:25.876
Now, how did you determine that
you were going to strike

29:25.877 --> 29:31.195
that source of blood
from behind the stairway?

29:31.196 --> 29:34.915
I wanted to see what it would do
from that side. Why is that?

29:34.916 --> 29:36.595
Just simply as an observation.

29:36.596 --> 29:38.195
So you'd rather see it from
that side

29:38.196 --> 29:40.314
than from the side
you thought it happened from?

29:40.315 --> 29:42.354
Yes.

29:42.355 --> 29:48.994
All right. I notice that...
Can we go back for a second?

29:48.995 --> 29:52.114
OK, let's just replay that again.

29:52.115 --> 29:54.073
Let's watch how high you go.

29:54.074 --> 29:58.993
I notice that you go about that
high, right? That amount of force.

29:58.994 --> 30:02.033
About that much.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.473
Can we play it through?

30:04.474 --> 30:06.354
Like that.

30:07.553 --> 30:10.032
Right? Stop it. That's correct.

30:10.033 --> 30:13.952
You realise that when somebody's
trying to beat somebody to death,

30:13.953 --> 30:17.632
generally speaking, they're not
going like this, right, sir?

30:17.633 --> 30:20.351
Generally speaking, if somebody's
trying to beat somebody to death,

30:20.352 --> 30:21.951
they're not going like that, right?

30:21.952 --> 30:24.391
That has nothing to do with
these experiments.

30:24.392 --> 30:27.111
I was simply producing
an impact spatter.

30:27.112 --> 30:29.031
Something hitting
a source of blood

30:29.032 --> 30:30.911
producing a pattern on the wall

30:30.912 --> 30:33.511
so that I could go back
and pull my strings.

30:33.512 --> 30:40.310
Sir, my question is... was your
theory here that

30:40.311 --> 30:43.990
Michael Peterson was standing
somewhere outside the stairway,

30:43.991 --> 30:48.149
leaning in, and doing swings
like that, yes or no?

30:48.150 --> 30:49.669
No. OK.

30:49.670 --> 30:50.749
Let me ask you this -

30:50.750 --> 30:53.629
if somebody was hitting a source
of blood right there

30:53.630 --> 30:56.710
and they brought it back,
where would the cast-off go?

31:00.150 --> 31:04.508
Again, there is many
variables on that also.

31:04.509 --> 31:09.748
If the weapon were swung
in not a full roundhouse swing,

31:09.749 --> 31:12.868
there probably wouldn't be
a cast off.

31:12.869 --> 31:15.747
If the weapon had been cleaned
in between swings,

31:15.748 --> 31:18.387
there wouldn't be a cast off.

31:18.388 --> 31:19.827
Let me stop you there.

31:19.828 --> 31:23.467
In other words, if somebody was
beating somebody to death

31:23.468 --> 31:24.987
and they hit them once,

31:24.988 --> 31:27.866
then they took a towel and wiped
down the weapon...

31:27.867 --> 31:29.386
CHUCKLING

31:29.387 --> 31:31.826
..and then brought it back,
then there wouldn't be cast off.

31:31.827 --> 31:33.627
That's correct.
Got you.

31:39.387 --> 31:44.945
Given the number of the amount
of blood in that stairway

31:44.946 --> 31:46.945
and spatter getting on shorts...

31:46.946 --> 31:49.745
You had spatter even on your
white protective suit,

31:49.746 --> 31:52.185
I think we saw a picture of that
yesterday, right?

31:52.186 --> 31:54.025
On one of the experiments, yes.

31:54.026 --> 31:55.824
It would have been at least useful

31:55.825 --> 31:58.784
to see if there were
any spatters on the shirt.

31:58.785 --> 32:00.424
That's correct.

32:00.425 --> 32:04.344
Your expertise indicates
that you just couldn't do that

32:04.345 --> 32:07.584
because it was dark blue, right?

32:07.585 --> 32:09.943
Well, yes, that is correct.

32:09.944 --> 32:14.823
Blood stain pattern analysis
is a visual examination.

32:14.824 --> 32:20.143
Had there, you know... I would have
looked for them, or whatever,

32:20.144 --> 32:21.782
to be cautious, or whatever.

32:21.783 --> 32:22.902
If I can't really see it,

32:22.903 --> 32:26.462
then I don't consider it for blood
stain spatter analysis.

32:26.463 --> 32:29.702
OK, well, of course,
you're aware, are you not,

32:29.703 --> 32:32.502
that there are other things
you can do,

32:32.503 --> 32:35.701
non-destructive things
you can do,

32:35.702 --> 32:41.182
to enhance your ability to see
spatter on a blue shirt, right?

32:43.942 --> 32:45.102
Um, no.

32:46.862 --> 32:52.340
Well, you've read Mr Epstein's
report, have you not? Yes, I have.

32:52.341 --> 32:57.220
Does he not indicate further testing
of the shirt

32:57.221 --> 33:00.900
by alternate light sources,

33:00.901 --> 33:05.699
chemical or photographic techniques
may be warranted

33:05.700 --> 33:11.059
to further categorise -
characterise - this blood stain.

33:11.060 --> 33:12.619
That is correct.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.939
So let me ask you
the question again.

33:14.940 --> 33:19.218
There are techniques available -
to people who are trained

33:19.219 --> 33:23.138
in this field,
who are experts in this field -

33:23.139 --> 33:28.339
to enhance one's ability to see
spatter on a blue shirt, correct?

33:31.178 --> 33:34.817
Eh, some people do use those,
that's correct.

33:34.818 --> 33:38.937
Actually, after that report came and
suggested that we might do that,

33:38.938 --> 33:44.096
then that shirt was taken to
the laboratory and somebody who...

33:44.097 --> 33:46.856
We were there, somebody was there,
Suzi Barker,

33:46.857 --> 33:50.136
who had experience with that,
more experience than I had.

33:50.137 --> 33:51.736
We took a look at that.

33:51.737 --> 33:53.976
We didn't find anything with that,

33:53.977 --> 33:58.375
but it really doesn't go
any more to that.

33:58.376 --> 34:02.335
I didn't see blood spatter on it,
so that's what I reported.

34:02.336 --> 34:04.615
Well, hold on a second.

34:04.616 --> 34:08.376
Did you write a report
about that lumalite test?

34:09.855 --> 34:12.974
Eh... Yes, I think so, yes.

34:12.975 --> 34:16.094
You did? Yes. Did you give it to
the district attorney?

34:16.094 --> 34:18.094
Yes. May we approach, Your Honour?

34:27.293 --> 34:30.574
That's big.
That's really fucking big.

34:32.293 --> 34:34.333
That's really big.

34:34.333 --> 34:39.012
The fact that they ran a lumalite
and didn't find anything.

34:39.013 --> 34:42.452
You know, in some jurisdictions,
they'd strike his testimony.

34:42.453 --> 34:45.371
I know that, but still...

34:45.373 --> 34:47.732
What's most amazing about
the experiment is that he admits

34:47.733 --> 34:52.170
he struck a location that didn't
exist with a random amount of force

34:52.172 --> 34:56.331
and a random amount of blood to try
to produce the stain. Right.

34:56.331 --> 34:59.011
So he knows he can produce
that stain in a scenario that

34:59.012 --> 35:01.012
he knows did not exist at the scene.
Right.

35:03.492 --> 35:07.010
That's exactly right.
Make a note of that for closing.

35:07.011 --> 35:09.290
You know that under
the Constitution,

35:09.291 --> 35:13.650
a defendant is entitled
to any evidence that may tend

35:13.651 --> 35:16.970
to exculpate him, you're aware of
that, are you not? Yes, I am.

35:16.971 --> 35:18.809
And that the district
attorney is under

35:18.810 --> 35:25.009
a constitutional obligation to turn
over such evidence to the defendant,

35:25.010 --> 35:27.729
you're aware of that? Yes, I am.

35:27.730 --> 35:32.968
Did you provide a copy of this
report to the district attorney

35:32.969 --> 35:35.488
so that he could give it to us?

35:35.489 --> 35:38.048
As far as I remember, I did.

35:38.049 --> 35:40.648
Well, how do you generally deliver
reports to the DA?

35:40.649 --> 35:44.807
As soon as their copies come to me,
then I make a hand delivery of them.

35:44.808 --> 35:47.447
So you would have
hand-delivered this?

35:47.448 --> 35:50.367
Yes. To Mr Hardin? Yes.

35:50.368 --> 35:52.247
Do you recall having a conversation
with him

35:52.248 --> 35:54.207
about handing him this report?

35:54.208 --> 35:55.327
No, I don't.

35:55.328 --> 35:58.166
Or Miss Black? No, I don't.

35:58.167 --> 36:00.726
You're certainly not suggesting that
if they got this report

36:00.727 --> 36:03.246
they wouldn't have turned
it over to me.

36:03.247 --> 36:05.846
I'm making no suggestion.

36:05.847 --> 36:08.406
You recall telling them
that there were

36:08.407 --> 36:11.045
no spatters that you could see on
Michael Peterson's shirt?

36:11.046 --> 36:12.086
I don't.

36:14.086 --> 36:17.485
Did you think they just didn't
need to know that?

36:17.486 --> 36:19.685
My answer was
I don't recall telling him.

36:19.686 --> 36:21.725
OK.

36:21.726 --> 36:24.125
INDISTINCT CHATTER

36:24.126 --> 36:25.564
Yes, sir.

36:25.565 --> 36:28.244
All right, members of the jury,
we'll take our afternoon recess.

36:28.245 --> 36:31.644
Remember the instructions
I've given you throughout the...

36:31.645 --> 36:34.804
He's fucking chopped liver.

36:34.805 --> 36:37.764
The other thing that we saw today
that was pretty remarkable

36:37.765 --> 36:44.363
was a report prepared
by the SBI agent Mr Deaver

36:44.364 --> 36:48.323
in which he was supposed to be
checking using a lumalite,

36:48.324 --> 36:49.803
I think it's called,

36:49.804 --> 36:53.602
to check for blood spatter evidence
on Michael Peterson's shirt.

36:53.603 --> 36:57.402
He prepared, it turns out,
a report on that work that he did,

36:57.403 --> 37:01.522
but that report had not
come forward.

37:01.523 --> 37:05.561
My question is were there
any blood transfers or smears

37:05.562 --> 37:08.801
or was that shirt totally clean?
That is unclear,

37:08.802 --> 37:13.281
although the evidence today seems
to suggest that there was nothing.

37:13.282 --> 37:15.481
It seems to me he changed shirts.

37:15.482 --> 37:19.880
I wonder if it wasn't another shirt
as well, but that hasn't yet...

37:19.881 --> 37:24.800
I think we're going to pursue that
some more tomorrow in court, but...

37:24.801 --> 37:28.161
Sometimes I think they're watching
a different trial.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.600
HOME VIDEO PLAYS

37:56.879 --> 37:59.278
Oh!

38:05.038 --> 38:09.197
Um, I'm looking for the poker.

38:09.198 --> 38:13.517
To make sure I marked down every
time that a fireplace was shown.

38:20.157 --> 38:24.356
It's so frustrating to sit there in
court and know the answers to things

38:24.357 --> 38:28.115
that Jim Hardin is, "Ooh, this,"
or "Ooh, there's blood there.

38:28.116 --> 38:30.755
"Ooh, this", when you've lived it
every day of your life and

38:30.756 --> 38:34.515
you know exactly why it's there
and you can't say anything.

38:34.516 --> 38:37.675
You know, you have to just wait
for the lawyers to get it in,

38:37.676 --> 38:42.474
and then it's not even considered
fact because it's just hearsay.

38:42.475 --> 38:45.074
It's so frustrating.

38:45.075 --> 38:49.594
I've been filming since 1994,
I guess.

38:49.595 --> 38:52.354
Christmas in 1994,
I've been filming our family,

38:52.355 --> 38:56.673
and so anything that can help,
I'm going to help.

38:56.674 --> 39:01.993
In the picture that the DA has,
it's lying horizontally,

39:01.994 --> 39:04.393
maybe, like, there.

39:04.394 --> 39:06.872
It's kind of cut off.
Clayton is standing here.

39:06.873 --> 39:09.432
He's a freshman in college at Duke,

39:09.433 --> 39:12.512
and Wilbur is a puppy
and he's sitting right there

39:12.513 --> 39:17.952
where Wilbur is now, but this is
many years later, in 1999,

39:17.953 --> 39:21.271
and there's
no blow poke to be seen, so...

39:21.272 --> 39:23.431
I don't even remember the blow poke

39:23.432 --> 39:27.791
being there, except when we first
moved in the house.

39:27.792 --> 39:31.151
So they're kind of stupid
for using that.

39:31.152 --> 39:34.631
This whole trial is pretty
pointless, if you ask me.

39:40.031 --> 39:44.190
'Mom, it's cute!

39:44.191 --> 39:45.271
'Mom!'

40:18.348 --> 40:23.467
Dr Radisch, do you have an opinion
as to how these various injuries

40:23.468 --> 40:26.987
on Miss Peterson's face
would have occurred?

40:26.988 --> 40:29.186
Yes.
What is that opinion?

40:29.187 --> 40:34.826
The injuries, for instance
of the right eyelid, the injuries,

40:34.827 --> 40:40.985
the abrasions, below the left eye,
I would not expect those to

40:40.986 --> 40:45.305
occur as a result of falling against
a flat, firm surface.

40:45.306 --> 40:47.985
They're in areas that are normally
protected

40:47.986 --> 40:50.945
by bones that stick
out around them,

40:50.946 --> 40:56.624
so they wouldn't have
contact with a flat surface.

40:56.625 --> 41:02.584
On the head, there were seven areas
of laceration.

41:02.585 --> 41:05.464
Again, these are...

41:05.465 --> 41:08.143
Lacerations are tears.

41:08.144 --> 41:13.383
In many of these lacerations,
they were actually full thickness,

41:13.384 --> 41:18.263
or all the way through the scalp
to the underlying skull.

41:18.264 --> 41:21.422
It's not been pulled away,
but at the autopsy,

41:21.423 --> 41:27.302
we could actually pull these pieces
of tissues up as a flap,

41:27.303 --> 41:29.782
or this piece of tissue,
for instance,

41:29.783 --> 41:33.702
in this particular wound,
pulled up as a flap.

41:33.703 --> 41:38.741
Now, with respect to
the cumulative injuries,

41:38.742 --> 41:45.141
do you have an opinion
as to whether they collectively

41:45.142 --> 41:50.460
are consistent with
a fall down the steps? Yes, I do.

41:50.461 --> 41:52.260
What is that opinion?

41:52.261 --> 41:56.260
In my opinion, all the injuries
found on this body

41:56.261 --> 42:00.141
are not consistent with
a fall down the stairs.

42:01.221 --> 42:05.699
Let me ask you whether those are
consistent with having been

42:05.700 --> 42:11.020
struck with something like what is
marked here as State's Exhibit 72?

42:16.539 --> 42:20.218
Yeah...
Yes, in my opinion, they could be.

42:20.219 --> 42:22.578
In looking at the nature
of the injuries that

42:22.579 --> 42:25.818
Kathleen Peterson had suffered,

42:25.819 --> 42:29.897
we decided that we were going to
go back at least ten years

42:29.898 --> 42:33.937
and look at every beating death that
had occurred in North Carolina

42:33.938 --> 42:35.457
and see what the injuries were,

42:35.458 --> 42:38.897
because Kathleen Peterson had
no skull fracture,

42:38.898 --> 42:41.337
she had no massive brain injuries,

42:41.338 --> 42:43.976
indeed, she had virtually
no injuries to her brain at all.

42:43.977 --> 42:46.857
She didn't even have
any bruising on the brain.

42:48.177 --> 42:51.576
We went back and we looked at
in excess of 250 cases,

42:51.577 --> 42:54.296
which were all the cases
involving beating deaths

42:54.297 --> 42:56.776
in North Carolina
for the past decade.

42:57.936 --> 43:01.495
There was not a single case
involving multiple blows

43:01.496 --> 43:08.415
to the head where there was not
either skull fracture or massive

43:08.416 --> 43:11.134
injuries to the brain, or both.

43:11.135 --> 43:13.454
You didn't have that in this case.

43:13.455 --> 43:20.574
Would it be fair to say that in
cases involving beatings

43:20.575 --> 43:27.373
with blunt objects where someone
is really trying to kill somebody

43:27.374 --> 43:35.373
that there are certain injuries
that one generally tends to see?

43:35.374 --> 43:39.932
I don't really... I think you would
have to be more specific.

43:39.933 --> 43:41.212
All right.

43:41.213 --> 43:42.773
Can I approach?

43:44.333 --> 43:47.172
I want to just put these up here.

43:47.173 --> 43:49.611
Obviously you're not going to be
able read these all,

43:49.612 --> 43:52.251
but I want you to just tell me
if they appear to you to be,

43:52.252 --> 43:54.211
just from looking at them,

43:54.212 --> 44:00.291
a collection of all the autopsies
involving blunt trauma to the head

44:00.292 --> 44:04.290
in North Carolina from 1991 to 2003.

44:04.291 --> 44:06.330
Objection.

44:06.331 --> 44:11.530
She can respond however she wants
to respond. Overruled.

44:11.531 --> 44:13.531
CHUCKLING FROM GALLERY

44:15.451 --> 44:18.969
I don't really think I can give you
an accurate answer to your question.

44:18.970 --> 44:21.489
All right. Not today.

44:21.490 --> 44:23.009
LAUGHTER

44:23.010 --> 44:24.449
Are you aware, Dr Radisch,

44:24.450 --> 44:30.648
that out of the 257 cases
in North Carolina since 1991,

44:30.649 --> 44:35.528
there is not a single case
where a person was beaten

44:35.529 --> 44:38.568
with an object such as this,

44:38.569 --> 44:45.087
whether it was metal
or wood or hollow or not,

44:45.088 --> 44:48.447
not a single case documented where
a person was beaten

44:48.448 --> 44:51.447
with an object like this in the head

44:51.448 --> 44:56.847
where there was not skull factures
and massive brain injury?

44:56.848 --> 44:58.166
Are you aware of that?

44:58.167 --> 45:01.606
I don't know that because
I haven't reviewed them.

45:01.607 --> 45:05.766
Of course, Kathleen Peterson
didn't have any skull fracture.

45:05.767 --> 45:07.166
No, she didn't.

45:07.167 --> 45:12.405
Or any contusion on the brain.
No. Or any oedema. No.

45:12.406 --> 45:15.485
And she didn't have any broken
bones in her hands. No.

45:15.486 --> 45:17.565
Or her ribs. No.

45:17.566 --> 45:20.365
And are you familiar with the case
up in Nova Scotia,

45:20.366 --> 45:22.885
a similar set of circumstances,

45:22.886 --> 45:26.684
where a wife was found at the foot
of the stairs and her husband,

45:26.685 --> 45:31.524
Clayton Johnson, was charged with
murder? I've heard of it.

45:31.525 --> 45:33.284
In that case,

45:33.285 --> 45:38.483
the forensic experts called
by the prosecution at trial

45:38.484 --> 45:43.243
testified under oath that they could
determine that the injuries

45:43.244 --> 45:47.363
were inconsistent with a fall and
had to be from a beating,

45:47.364 --> 45:48.723
isn't that right?

45:48.724 --> 45:52.522
I don't know details of the case,
I don't know what the injuries were.

45:52.523 --> 45:57.362
Well, do you know that after serving
some number of years in prison,

45:57.363 --> 46:00.762
a number of forensic pathologists

46:00.763 --> 46:04.881
and people who study injury
biomechanics

46:04.882 --> 46:07.881
and various other experts
were put together

46:07.882 --> 46:11.921
by the government of Canada
to look into that case?

46:11.922 --> 46:16.201
I know that it was reviewed
and that a different decision,

46:16.202 --> 46:18.600
or different determination,
was made.

46:18.601 --> 46:22.960
And what was determined
was that the injuries

46:22.961 --> 46:28.280
that the initial State's
forensic pathologist testified

46:28.281 --> 46:30.560
you would not expect from a fall

46:30.561 --> 46:34.279
in fact had come from a fall.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.520
Right?

46:38.000 --> 46:39.280
Yes.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.319
That's all I have.
Thank you, Doctor.
