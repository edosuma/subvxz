00:02.520 --> 00:04.112
Whenever I see the news
and they're...

00:04.280 --> 00:08.910
...hauling in some criminal, terrorist,
psycho, maniac, mass-murderer guy...

00:11.360 --> 00:13.237
You notice he's always
covering up his face?

00:13.400 --> 00:14.549
What is he worried about?

00:14.720 --> 00:16.631
I mean,
what is this man's reputation...

00:16.800 --> 00:19.917
...that he has to worry
about this kind of exposure...

00:20.080 --> 00:22.548
...damaging his good name?

00:22.720 --> 00:25.598
I mean, what is he,
up for a big job promotion...

00:25.760 --> 00:27.273
...down at the office or something?

00:27.440 --> 00:29.590
Afraid the boss is gonna
catch this on TV and go:

00:29.760 --> 00:33.116
"Isn't that Johnson from sales?

00:33.280 --> 00:36.636
He's up in that clock tower,
picking people off one by one.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.392
I don't know
if that's the kind of man...

00:38.560 --> 00:40.710
...we want heading up
that new branch office.

00:40.880 --> 00:46.193
He should be in bill collection.
I think he's got aptitude."

00:53.760 --> 00:55.955
She was great.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.912
You don't want to know.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.959
Hey, Brecky, remind me to tell you
what we did in Lake George.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.430
Get this, I got it all on video.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.436
That's it. This is it.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.511
I'm done! Through! It's over!

01:10.680 --> 01:12.432
I'm gone! Finished! Over!

01:12.600 --> 01:15.160
I will never work for you again!
Look at you.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.276
You think you're an important man?

01:17.560 --> 01:20.199
You are a laughingstock.
You are a joke.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.157
These people are laughing at you!

01:22.320 --> 01:26.871
You're nothing! You have no brains,
no ability, nothing!

01:27.040 --> 01:28.712
I quit!

01:34.880 --> 01:35.869
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.759
Boy, I have really
had it with Newman.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.992
He wakes me up again, last night,
at 3:00 in the morning...

01:42.160 --> 01:44.390
...to tell me he's going on the roof
to kill himself.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.869
- Well, what did you say?
- I said, "Jump."

01:48.440 --> 01:50.590
He's been threatening
to do this for years.

01:50.760 --> 01:54.673
I said, "If you're gonna kill yourself,
do it already and stop bothering me."

01:55.160 --> 01:58.311
At least I'd respect the guy
for accomplishing something.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.754
What's his problem?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.433
No job, no women.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.155
He called the right guy.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.399
What am I supposed to tell him?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.471
How much there is
for him to live for?

02:09.320 --> 02:10.958
Why should I lie to him?

02:11.800 --> 02:13.438
I'm leaving. I'm going to the laundry.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.989
Why don't you use the machines
down in the basement?

02:16.480 --> 02:18.550
Fluff and fold, the only way to live.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.679
I drop it off, I pick it up.
It's a delight.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.750
- How about if I put a...?
- I don't want to do that.

02:25.920 --> 02:30.198
- What, you're going over there, what?
- I don't want to mix in everything.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.670
My guys don't know your guys.

02:34.120 --> 02:37.271
You can't just lock them all
in the same machine together.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.714
They'll start a riot.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.393
Have you ever met my guys?

02:40.800 --> 02:44.236
- No, I can't say as I have.
- Well...

02:44.400 --> 02:46.470
All right, put them on top.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.431
Oh, beautiful.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.513
This stuff on top is my friend's.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.716
Could I get it done
in a separate machine?

02:53.880 --> 02:55.711
I'll have to charge you
for another machine.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.393
Whatever it costs. In fact...

02:57.560 --> 03:01.109
...I would prefer it if the machines
are not even touching each other...

03:01.280 --> 03:03.953
...because something could,
you know, jump across.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.433
Guess what.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.314
- How did you know I was here?
- Kramer. Guess what.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.710
- I don't know.
- I quit my job.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.235
- Get out of here.
- I couldn't take it anymore.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.879
You can have this on Monday.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.189
What happened? Levitan?

03:19.360 --> 03:22.238
I go in to use his private bathroom.
Everybody uses it.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.152
And then I get a memo...
A memo...

03:24.320 --> 03:27.198
...telling me to use
the men's room in the hall.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.397
I mean, we share it with
Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!

03:30.920 --> 03:32.148
You and your toilets.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.357
I snapped. It was the last straw.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.878
What are you gonna do?
Look for something else in real estate?

03:39.040 --> 03:41.110
Nobody's hiring now.
The market's terrible.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.195
So, what are you gonna do?

03:48.280 --> 03:50.236
I like sports. I could do
something in sports.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.428
In what capacity?

04:00.040 --> 04:03.032
You know, like the general manager
of a baseball team.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.070
Yeah, well, that...
That can be tough to get.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.192
Well, it doesn't even have to be
the general manager.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.119
Maybe I could be, like, an announcer,
like, a colour man.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.553
You know how I always make...

04:17.720 --> 04:19.517
...interesting comments
during the game?

04:20.200 --> 04:22.236
Yeah. Yeah,
you make good comments.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.072
So, what about that?

04:24.240 --> 04:27.755
Well, they tend to give
those jobs to ex-ballplayers...

04:27.920 --> 04:31.993
...and people that are,
you know, in broadcasting.

04:36.320 --> 04:39.073
- Well, that's really not fair.
- I know.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.075
Well, okay, okay.
What else do you like?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.073
Movies. I like to watch movies.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.959
Yeah, yeah.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.670
Do they pay people
to watch movies?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.117
Projectionists.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.998
- That's true.
- But you got to know...

04:57.160 --> 04:59.071
...how to work the projector.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.278
Right.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.192
And it's probably a union thing.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.752
Those unions.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.674
Okay, sports...

05:09.840 --> 05:11.671
...movies...

05:13.120 --> 05:15.190
What about a talk show host?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.550
Talk show host, that's good.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.479
I think I'd be good at that.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.676
I talk to people all the time.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.796
Someone said once I'd be
a good talk show host.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.315
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple of people.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.552
How do you get that?
Where do you start?

05:32.720 --> 05:35.280
Well, that's where it gets tricky.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.437
You can't walk into a building and say,
"I want to be a talk show host."

05:39.600 --> 05:41.113
I wouldn't think so.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.358
It's all politics.

05:44.040 --> 05:48.636
All right, okay, sports, movies,
talk show host...

05:48.840 --> 05:50.558
What else?

05:53.760 --> 05:55.830
This could have been
a huge mistake.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.157
Yeah, well, it doesn't sound like
you completely thought this through.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.473
I guess not.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.992
- What should I do?
- Maybe you can just go back.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.268
- Go back?
- Yeah.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.073
Pretend like it never happened.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.233
You mean just walk in on Monday
morning like it never happened?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.675
Sure. You're an emotional person.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.638
People don't take you seriously.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.035
Just go back.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.675
- Pretend it never happened.
- Never happened.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.797
I was blowing off a little steam.
So what?

06:27.960 --> 06:31.191
- So what? You're entitled.
- I'm emotional.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.271
That's right, you're emotional.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.713
- Never happened.
- Never happened.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.318
To me, the most annoying thing...

06:40.480 --> 06:43.438
...about the couple of times
I did work in an office...

06:43.600 --> 06:46.398
...is when you go in in the morning,
you say "hi" to everyone...

06:46.560 --> 06:48.437
...and then, throughout the day...

06:48.600 --> 06:51.558
...you have to continue
to greet these people...

06:51.720 --> 06:54.075
...all day, every time you see them.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.959
"Morning, Bill." "Morning, Bob."
"How you doing?" "Fine."

06:57.120 --> 06:59.839
Ten minutes later, you see them
in the hall, "How you doing?"

07:00.000 --> 07:02.753
Every time you pass, you've gotta
come up with another greeting.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.478
You start racking your brains.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.996
You do the little eyebrow,
you know, "Hey."

07:09.120 --> 07:10.997
You start coming up
with nicknames for them.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.957
"Jimbo."

07:20.000 --> 07:21.592
How you doing?

07:22.200 --> 07:24.350
What are you doing here?

07:24.680 --> 07:26.272
What? I work here.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.476
I thought you quit.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.837
What quit? Who quit?

07:34.160 --> 07:35.513
Bill, how was your weekend?

07:35.680 --> 07:38.069
Excellent weekend.
What about your weekend?

07:38.240 --> 07:40.549
- Fine weekend.
- Yeah, good weekend.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.518
Went up to the Cape.
Took the kids sailing.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.238
Lisa was a little scared at first...

07:45.400 --> 07:47.470
...but that kid's gonna be
a good sailor someday.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.437
She's gonna be a fine sailor.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.315
Ava, what happened to you
Friday afternoon?

07:55.480 --> 07:58.995
- I got tied up.
- I'll bet you did.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.160
I want to remind everyone
that the 10th anniversary party...

08:04.320 --> 08:07.835
...for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be
Wednesday afternoon at 4:00...

08:08.000 --> 08:09.956
...in Lasky's Bar on Madison and 48th.

08:10.120 --> 08:14.557
I want all of you to be there.
This really means a lot to me.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.551
Is that Costanza over there?

08:20.440 --> 08:22.317
What are you doing here?

08:22.880 --> 08:26.555
- What?
- Am I crazy or didn't you quit?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.196
- When?
- Friday.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.998
Oh, what? That?

08:31.160 --> 08:33.594
Are you kidding? I didn't quit.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.990
Why, you took that seriously?

08:36.159 --> 08:38.116
You mean "laughingstock,"
all that stuff.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.633
Come on. Will you stop it?

08:39.799 --> 08:42.871
- "No brains, no ability"?
- Teasing.

08:43.039 --> 08:46.191
Okay, I want you out of here.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.033
I don't know where
you're getting this from.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.596
You're serious, aren't you?
Oh, you see...

08:52.760 --> 08:54.478
...you just don't know
my sense of humour.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.394
I mean, Dan, don't I joke around
all the time?

08:58.560 --> 09:00.471
I wouldn't say all the time.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.438
You can't win.
You can't beat me.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.468
That's why I'm here,
and you're there.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.753
Because I'm a winner.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.960
I'll always be a winner...

09:13.120 --> 09:16.476
...and you'll always be a loser.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.469
"I'll always be a winner,
and you'll always be a loser."

09:24.640 --> 09:26.312
This is what he said to me.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.630
- Well, so that's that.
- No, that's not that.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.031
- That's not that?
- No.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.191
Well, if that's not that, what is that?

09:33.440 --> 09:36.079
I got some plans. I got plans.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.231
- What kind of plans?
- What's the difference?

09:38.400 --> 09:40.072
You don't wanna tell me?

09:43.520 --> 09:45.750
I'm gonna slip him a Mickey.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.075
What, in his drink?
Are you out of your mind?

09:52.240 --> 09:54.231
What are you, Peter Lorre?

09:54.560 --> 09:58.109
You don't understand.
He's got this big party coming up.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.556
He's been looking forward to this.
This is gonna destroy the whole thing.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.274
- What if you destroy him?
- No, no, no. Don't worry.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.237
It's perfectly safe. I researched it.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.516
He'll get a little woozy.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.831
He might keel over.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.399
- Well, what does that do? Big deal.
- This is what they'd do in the movies.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.949
It's the beautiful thing.
It's like a movie.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.793
I'm gonna slip him a Mickey.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.755
You've really gone mental.

10:24.440 --> 10:28.149
Where are you gonna get this Mickey?
I can't believe I'm saying "Mickey."

10:30.080 --> 10:32.150
I got a source.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.437
You got a Mickey source?

10:36.480 --> 10:39.040
And Elaine is gonna
keep him busy.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.238
Elaine? How did you rope
her into this?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.914
I told her what a sexist he is.
How he cheats on his wife.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.878
- She knew that.
- She didn't know he doesn't recycle.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.270
What is the point of all this?

10:49.440 --> 10:52.637
- Revenge.
- The best revenge is living well.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.429
There's no chance of that.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.833
- Did you get your laundry?
- Yeah.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.158
What's with you?

11:12.640 --> 11:14.198
He jumped.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.912
- What?
- Newman jumped.

11:18.680 --> 11:22.559
- Did he call you last night?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.031
What did you say?

11:25.240 --> 11:27.993
I said, "Wave to me
when you pass my window."

11:30.440 --> 11:32.112
Did he wave?

11:34.400 --> 11:37.551
No. He jumped
from the second floor.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.518
Mr. Papanicolas saw him
from across the street.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.716
He's lying out there faking.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.472
See, he's trying to get back at me.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.596
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's the matter?

11:49.760 --> 11:52.593
On Thursday when I came home,
I had 1500 dollars on me.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.194
For some reason, I decided to hide it
in my laundry bag...

11:55.360 --> 11:58.158
...and then I completely
forgot about it.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.630
And then I took the laundry
in on Friday!

12:02.560 --> 12:05.313
- Oh, come on, let's go.
- Where? Where?

12:05.480 --> 12:07.277
To the Laundromat.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.949
I never saw it.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.032
Okay, come on, give the guy
his money. What are you doing?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.918
Hey, you see that sign up there?

12:15.880 --> 12:18.314
I see. You put up a sign
so you can do whatever you want.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.993
You're not a part of society.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.309
Yeah, that's right.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.516
Because this place is my country...

12:23.680 --> 12:27.468
...and I'm the president,
and that's my Constitution.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.757
I'm not responsible.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.593
So anybody leaves anything here,
you could just take it.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.988
You have a license to steal.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.311
You are like
the James Bond of laundry.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.235
- You ever hear of a bank?
- Come on, let's go.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.675
No, you can't let him
get away with this.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.956
- Which one is he?
- That's him over there.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.315
The one that looks like a blowfish.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.273
- Oh, yeah. I see him.
- Yeah.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.319
Hey, thanks for doing this.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.517
Why pass up the opportunity
to go to prison?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.230
This is the most exciting thing
I've ever done.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.436
Yeah, it is kind of cool.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.909
First time in my life I've ever
gotten back at someone.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.470
I can't believe we're doing this. It's
the kind of thing they do in the movies.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.039
That's exactly what I told Jerry.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.872
- Really?
- Yes.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.838
God, I've never felt so alive.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.473
Maybe we should call this off.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.472
Come on, what's the big deal?

13:32.640 --> 13:36.030
We're just gonna put a little concrete
in the washing machine.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.998
- And what's gonna happen?
- Well, it'll mix up with the water...

13:40.160 --> 13:43.436
...and then, by the end of the cycle,
it'll be a solid block.

13:45.360 --> 13:49.035
If only you could put your mind
to something worthwhile.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.194
You're like Lex Luthor.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.591
You keep him busy.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.392
You go over there,
you start flirting with him...

14:18.560 --> 14:21.438
...and I'll come by,
and while you're keeping him busy...

14:21.600 --> 14:23.556
...l'll slip it in his drink.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.029
Wouldn't it be easier
just to punch him in the mouth?

14:26.920 --> 14:29.115
Come on. They're terrible.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.998
They got no infield.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.997
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.957
I'm gonna get some food.
You want some?

14:37.120 --> 14:38.439
No.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.519
Hi.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.113
Hi.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.952
God bless you.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.757
Thank you. Thank you very much.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.313
Really, I mean that.
I am not one of those people...

15:07.480 --> 15:10.074
...who gives insincere thank-yous.
No, sir. No, sir.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.754
When I thank somebody,
I really thank them.

15:12.920 --> 15:16.276
So thank you.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.273
- You're welcome.
- People don't say "God bless you"...

15:24.440 --> 15:27.034
...as much as they used to.
Have you noticed that?

15:27.840 --> 15:29.239
No.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.837
So I'm going
to a nudist colony next week.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.789
Nudist colony? Really?

15:44.960 --> 15:48.191
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I love nudist colonies.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.033
They help me unwind.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.518
I've never been to a nudist colony.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.797
Oh, really? Oh, you should go.
They're great. They're great.

15:56.960 --> 16:01.272
Of course, when it's over, it's hard to
get used to all this clothing, you know.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.874
So a lot of times I'll just lock the door
to my office...

16:04.040 --> 16:05.712
...and I'll just sit there naked.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.388
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.516
I usually work naked
a couple hours a day.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.758
Glenda, can I ask you a favour?

16:17.920 --> 16:19.148
Could I have this seat?

16:19.880 --> 16:23.395
What do you have to sit here for?
There are plenty of other seats.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.996
I can't explain.
It's very important that I sit here.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.594
What are you doing here anyway?
I thought you were fired.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.320
Okay, okay. Fine.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.916
I cook naked, I clean...

16:39.640 --> 16:43.553
I clean naked. I drive naked.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.075
Naked, naked, naked.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.388
Who are you?

16:49.520 --> 16:51.988
Oh, you don't want to know, mister.
I'm trouble.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.991
Big trouble.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.594
What about the gentle cycle?
You ever use that?

17:15.839 --> 17:19.150
Do you think it's effeminate for a man
to put clothes in a gentle cycle?

17:23.440 --> 17:27.069
What about fine fabrics? How do you
deal with that kind of temperament?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.509
What about stonewashing?
You ever witness one of those?

17:35.680 --> 17:40.151
That must be something. What, do they
just pummel the jeans with rocks?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.560
I didn't realize it was a full box.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.476
I'm gonna count to three.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.835
If you don't give up the chair...

17:55.000 --> 17:57.560
...the wig is coming off.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.674
I don't wear a wig.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.431
One...

18:06.200 --> 18:08.430
No, I'm sorry.
I don't really have a phone.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.352
In fact, I don't really have
an apartment.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.511
I kind of sleep around.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.158
I just like to have a few drinks...

18:18.320 --> 18:20.914
...and then just let the guy do
whatever he wants.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.510
Would you close your eyes
a second?

18:26.680 --> 18:29.274
I want to tell you a secret
about my bra.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.557
Hello, Rick.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.153
Hey, look who's here.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.709
That's right, Ricky boy, it's me.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.077
You know something, Costanza,
I'm a very lucky man.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.389
I've always been lucky.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.552
Things just to seem to fall
right in my lap.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.033
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.556
In fact, I'm glad you're here,
you know.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.995
Maybe I've been
a little rough on you.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.071
Why should we let
personal differences...

19:02.240 --> 19:03.514
...get in the way of business?

19:03.680 --> 19:05.955
I... I want you to come back.

19:06.120 --> 19:10.591
And you can use my bathroom
anytime you want.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.154
- You want me to come back?
- Yeah.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.117
Hey, how about a toast, huh?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.475
- Everybody, a toast!
- Rick.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.551
Everyone, I want to propose a toast...

19:20.720 --> 19:23.075
...to 10 great years
at Rick Barr Properties...

19:23.240 --> 19:25.879
- Rick.
...and all the people in this room...

19:26.040 --> 19:27.758
...that made that possible.
- Rick.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.229
I'd also like to welcome back
into the fold...

19:30.400 --> 19:33.790
...our little, shrimpy friend,
George Costanza...

19:33.960 --> 19:37.270
...who, although he really didn't have
a very good year...

19:37.440 --> 19:40.000
How you blew that McConnell deal,
I'll never know...

19:40.160 --> 19:42.071
...but, hey, what the hell, huh?

19:42.240 --> 19:44.310
We've always enjoyed his antics
around the office.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.951
Anything you want to add to this?

19:50.640 --> 19:52.392
Drink up!

19:58.440 --> 20:01.000
I like history, the Civil War.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.035
Maybe I could be a professor
or something.

20:06.840 --> 20:11.197
Well, to teach something,
you really have to know a lot about it.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.276
- I think you need a degree.
- Yeah, that's true.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.550
- Hey, don't...
- What?

20:24.840 --> 20:26.398
Oh, my God, the money.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.394
- The 1500, where'd you find it?
- It was in my laundry.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.918
In your laundry? The whole time?

20:34.720 --> 20:38.508
I told you not to mix in our guys.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.635
What did we figure the damage
on that machine would be?

20:43.520 --> 20:44.919
It was about 1200 bucks.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.038
Kramer!

20:48.200 --> 20:50.191
That's Newman.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.635
I'm on the roof!

20:54.720 --> 20:58.076
Well? What are you waiting for?

20:59.320 --> 21:01.311
Elaine, take a walk with me
to the Laundromat.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.152
I got to pay this guy the money.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.717
I like horses.
Maybe I could be a stable boy.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.599
You want to shoot some pool tonight?

21:09.760 --> 21:12.115
I can't. I'm going to a movie!

21:15.480 --> 21:18.916
Nah, it's probably a union thing.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.190
People like the idea of revenge.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.511
You ever hear the expression:
"The best revenge is living well"?

21:31.680 --> 21:34.990
I've said this. In other words,
it means, supposedly...

21:35.160 --> 21:36.752
...the best way to
get back at someone...

21:36.920 --> 21:40.071
...is by being happy and successful
in your own life.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.835
Sounds nice. Doesn't really work
on that Charles Bronson kind of level.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.072
You know, those movies where
his whole family gets wiped out...

21:47.240 --> 21:49.754
...by some street scum.
You think you could go up to him:

21:49.920 --> 21:53.549
"Charlie, forget the.357. You need
a custom-made suit and a convertible...

21:53.720 --> 21:55.676
...new carpeting,
French doors, a divan.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.400
That'll show those punks."
