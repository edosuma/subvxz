10:13.470 --> 10:15.190
I haven't got a chance to meet you yet.

10:15.190 --> 10:16.350
I've been taking care of your mom

10:16.350 --> 10:17.410
for about a month now.

10:17.410 --> 10:18.243
(clapping)

10:18.243 --> 10:19.650
- Congratulations.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.800
- She really speaks

10:20.800 --> 10:22.020
highly of you.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.010
She talks about you a lot, you know.

10:24.010 --> 10:25.140
I mean, I know it's kind of rough

10:25.140 --> 10:27.440
seeing her and the
condition that she's in but

10:28.740 --> 10:30.335
she really really loves you.

10:30.335 --> 10:31.709
- Her condition?

10:31.709 --> 10:33.623
Oh you mean AIDS, right?

10:35.460 --> 10:36.560

10:38.130 --> 10:39.916
I know she has a lot of regrets.

10:39.916 --> 10:41.773
- Regrets, really?

10:42.620 --> 10:44.740
Did she tell you she regretted

10:44.740 --> 10:46.390
I didn't exist her anymore

10:46.390 --> 10:47.890
after she found out I was gay?

10:49.620 --> 10:51.170
Here's the ticker.

10:51.170 --> 10:52.240
Does she regret telling me

10:52.240 --> 10:53.410
she hopes I get AIDS

10:53.410 --> 10:55.033
by one of these dyke bitches?

10:56.710 --> 10:58.343
Karma's a bitch right?

10:59.290 --> 11:00.970

Taking care of her selfish ass.

11:04.290 --> 11:06.043
- Everybody makes mistakes.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.590
what your mother really needs

11:08.590 --> 11:10.475
is a chance at redemption.

11:10.475 --> 11:13.392

16:17.180 --> 16:19.760

16:19.760 --> 16:21.900
I'm not leaving my sister like this.

16:21.900 --> 16:22.733

16:22.733 --> 16:24.290
I didn't ask y'all to come over here.

16:24.290 --> 16:25.920

16:28.550 --> 16:29.383

17:49.020 --> 17:50.860

17:50.860 --> 17:52.445
And I heard some shit out there.

17:52.445 --> 17:55.224
- Oh yeah, what you heard nigga?

17:55.224 --> 17:57.010
- I heard Bow hit a lick

17:57.010 --> 17:58.850
on a major club.

17:58.850 --> 18:00.410
Also heard he had his head blown

18:00.410 --> 18:02.550
off before he made up street.

18:02.550 --> 18:04.810
I heard the club looking for they bread,

18:04.810 --> 18:06.990
and Bow's hitters looking for a shooter.

18:06.990 --> 18:08.340
I know you ain't that dumb.

18:20.377 --> 18:21.970
Shit's not funny.

18:21.970 --> 18:22.930
Niggas had a lot of love

18:22.930 --> 18:24.810

18:24.810 --> 18:27.236
these niggas play some (mumbles).

18:27.236 --> 18:28.069
What you need to do is take

18:28.069 --> 18:29.780
that money and put it back.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.210
Call Bow hitters,

18:31.210 --> 18:33.077
and let them know who did it.

18:33.077 --> 18:35.670
(feigns moaning)

18:35.670 --> 18:36.700
- I guess I should write

18:36.700 --> 18:38.150
a 'I'm sorry letter' too huh?

18:39.030 --> 18:40.383
I ain't giving shit back.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.530

19:34.171 --> 19:35.120
- We figured you'd show up

19:35.120 --> 19:36.613
here sooner or later.

19:37.786 --> 19:40.119
You could not be here alone.

19:42.456 --> 19:44.960
- Yeah we grabbed some steak

19:44.960 --> 19:47.110
and shrimp from from Bevie's.

19:47.110 --> 19:47.943
Your favorite

19:49.510 --> 19:51.670
- Thank you but, I'm not hungry.

19:51.670 --> 19:53.120
- You gotta to eat something.

19:55.310 --> 19:56.143
- I'm sorry.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.430
- My nigga fuck that,

19:58.430 --> 20:01.960
if you ain't eating,
we ain't eating either.

20:03.662 --> 20:04.495
- I can't.

20:06.524 --> 20:07.524
I can't eat.

20:09.180 --> 20:12.193
I can't do anything.

20:15.312 --> 20:19.118
I just want him back.

20:19.118 --> 20:22.117
I just want him back.

20:23.166 --> 20:23.999
(sniffles)

20:23.999 --> 20:27.253
and I wanna kill whoever took him from me.

20:28.730 --> 20:30.210
Even if I have to kill them.

20:31.733 --> 20:33.610
- I hear you,

20:33.610 --> 20:34.740
but that's the last thing Bow

20:34.740 --> 20:36.283
would want for you.

20:37.517 --> 20:40.140
What you need is to be
around friends and family.

20:43.970 --> 20:45.355
Roll one up Rach.

20:45.355 --> 20:47.153
Nah I can't smoke.

20:48.100 --> 20:48.933
- Fuck that.

20:50.795 --> 20:52.378
I'm a little bored.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.190
These niggas took the money

20:55.190 --> 20:56.653
and still killed my dawg.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.200
- How you know that?

21:00.220 --> 21:02.713
- Cuz we was hitting that
Lick together last night.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.490
Heard a nigga in the background talking

21:05.490 --> 21:06.590
when the gun went off.

21:08.430 --> 21:10.130
I was the last nigga he talked to.

21:14.371 --> 21:16.621
- Did he say anything else?

21:17.900 --> 21:18.733
- No mmh

21:21.260 --> 21:23.293
nothing besides wanting to be with you.

21:25.704 --> 21:27.871
(sobbing)

21:36.062 --> 21:38.229
(gunfire)

21:40.434 --> 21:41.601
sergeant down!

21:44.666 --> 21:46.103
- You know when we was kids.

21:46.103 --> 21:47.753
We used to roam the streets.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.866
Used go to that gas station
always running for that candy

21:51.866 --> 21:52.699
(laughs)

21:52.699 --> 21:53.532
- yeah

21:53.532 --> 21:54.365
- This nigga Bow loved some starhearts bro

21:54.365 --> 21:56.532
(laughs).

21:58.680 --> 22:00.660
So we had to be like a,

22:00.660 --> 22:01.669
Maybe like 8 or 9

22:01.669 --> 22:03.960
we were shorties,

22:03.960 --> 22:04.793
you know what I'm saying,

22:04.793 --> 22:05.626
so we couldn't reach the windows

22:05.626 --> 22:06.930
in the basement.

22:06.930 --> 22:09.194
Like literally we had sit
on each other's back a

22:09.194 --> 22:11.623
till we popped that motherfucker.

22:11.623 --> 22:12.456
The window was one

22:12.456 --> 22:13.980
of them uhh them are all in windows,

22:13.980 --> 22:15.890
so we push it,

22:15.890 --> 22:16.723
it's gonna open a little bit

22:16.723 --> 22:18.140
at the bottom not a lot.

22:18.140 --> 22:19.430
- Right.

22:19.430 --> 22:21.310
- So uh this nigga Bow managed

22:21.310 --> 22:23.060
to get a big screen TV through

22:23.060 --> 22:23.893
that Motherfucker.

22:23.893 --> 22:25.720
We talking about the big screen

22:25.720 --> 22:26.840
with the fat back,

22:26.840 --> 22:28.514
the big old booty on that motherfucker.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.347
(laughs)

22:29.347 --> 22:30.180
- Wow

23:09.480 --> 23:12.017

came home and caught him.

23:12.902 --> 23:16.570
Bow's like man fuck it man keep it run.

Funny it seems

46:24.140 --> 46:26.140

46:28.409 --> 46:30.059
You know Black had that money the

54:27.077 --> 54:29.610

She's like my mom,

54:30.443 --> 54:32.613

54:33.520 --> 54:35.470
- Why are you so interested in my mama?

54:37.090 --> 54:38.093
- Because I'm a healer.

54:39.854 --> 54:41.123
- There's no healing what she got.

54:43.270 --> 54:44.880
- Just because you can't heal the body

54:44.880 --> 54:46.880
don't mean that you can't heal the mind.

54:48.550 --> 54:49.713
This is inappropriate.

54:50.799 --> 54:51.632
(Coughs)

54:51.632 --> 54:53.393

- Nicole,

55:38.970 --> 55:40.320

55:41.560 --> 55:44.266
She might not have a reason to come back.

55:44.266 --> 55:46.850
(laughs)

55:46.850 --> 55:47.813
- Already there.

55:57.570 --> 55:59.379
It's always good seeing you though.

55:59.379 --> 56:00.217

56:12.891 --> 56:15.474

56:31.230 --> 56:32.340
- Shit she's stalling this

56:32.340 --> 56:34.520

56:34.520 --> 56:36.770
- Can I hit the motherfucker first?

56:52.890 --> 56:55.420

56:55.420 --> 56:58.143

57:00.150 --> 57:03.040
Seems like shit is just getting worse.

57:03.040 --> 57:05.290
- Who's been saying that the entire time?

57:05.290 --> 57:07.370

57:08.550 --> 57:11.780

57:11.780 --> 57:13.300
it's like we got Instant Karma

57:13.300 --> 57:14.293
for what we did.

57:15.370 --> 57:17.450
Getting money that's one thing

57:17.450 --> 57:18.990
but killing.

57:18.990 --> 57:20.370
And none is you!

57:20.370 --> 57:21.203
You think BoW would want

57:21.203 --> 57:22.691
you out here taking his place?

57:22.691 --> 57:23.524
- Bow would want her

57:23.524 --> 57:24.357
to do whatever the fuck she need

57:24.357 --> 57:25.880
to do to be good out here.

57:25.880 --> 57:27.790
- Look we all have

57:27.790 --> 57:31.953
to just come to terms with
the fact that Bow is gone.

57:33.320 --> 57:34.720
One night,

57:34.720 --> 57:36.580
that cost him his life

57:36.580 --> 57:38.700
and it hurt his friends.

57:38.700 --> 57:40.790

57:49.670 --> 57:50.543
They gon pay.

57:51.910 --> 57:52.743

57:56.530 --> 57:58.430
- This nigga Pig called me last night.

58:00.399 --> 58:01.816
- Let him finish.

58:04.093 --> 58:06.210
- Apparently Don got him

58:06.210 --> 58:08.460

58:08.460 --> 58:09.700
And taking it to the spa that me

58:09.700 --> 58:10.873

58:12.207 --> 58:13.607
- If Pig is working for Don,

58:14.470 --> 58:17.000
then Don had Pig kill Bow.

58:17.000 --> 58:17.980
- How do y'all know that?

58:17.980 --> 58:19.640
y'all said Black killed him at first.

58:19.640 --> 58:20.720
- Same car we've seen outside

58:20.720 --> 58:22.780

58:22.780 --> 58:25.078

You go stop covering

58:31.310 --> 58:32.313

58:33.690 --> 58:34.970
- My baby daddy said if he didn't do

58:34.970 --> 58:36.680
what he did Don would have to killed us.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.820
- Are you just gonna believe that shit?

58:38.820 --> 58:39.800

58:44.460 --> 58:46.560
how he chose the other side.

58:46.560 --> 58:48.650
This is the only chance we gon get

58:48.650 --> 58:51.050
to take out whoever had anything

58:51.050 --> 58:52.540
to do with Bow's death.

58:52.540 --> 58:54.880
- I thought you said we
was done with revenge?

58:54.880 --> 58:56.230
- And we are I'm not talking

58:56.230 --> 58:57.503
about killing nobody.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.273
We're just gonna make
them wish they was dead.

59:02.140 --> 59:03.840
- Oh (mumbles)

59:03.840 --> 59:05.360

01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:36.020
- Look, either y'all gonna take us in,

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:36.990
or y'all gonna grab Don

01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:38.340
and take him and let us go.

01:24:39.414 --> 01:24:41.330
- Why the fuck would we do that?

01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:45.130
- Because it's 6 million
in that white van.

01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:46.805
So the way I see it,

01:24:46.805 --> 01:24:47.950
y'all just caught a couple bank robbers

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:48.783
before they can get away

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.310
with the money.

01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:52.920
- and you bring in the
only living suspect.

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.950
- but he's not gonna cooperate

01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:55.460
with how much money he stole.

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.470
- plus all the financial records

01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:59.303
are gone.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.660
But he knows how much
money has been stolen could

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:04.140
be what six million,

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.093
sixty thou,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.483
plus oh, two?

01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:09.643
He dead dead.

01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:13.290
- Yo that's cute and all but uh

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:16.570
what's to stop us from

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:17.403
killing y'all right here

01:25:17.403 --> 01:25:18.940
and taking our all the cash?.

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:20.540
I mean shit.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.240
Nobody know we out here but y'all.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.760
- My son.

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:25.760
If don't go pick him up soon

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.593
he gon call the feds

01:25:26.593 --> 01:25:27.730
and let them know everything

01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:31.319
- Your Move.

01:25:31.319 --> 01:25:33.402
(upbeat)

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.339
- Get the fuck outta here.

01:25:36.339 --> 01:25:38.506
- Get the fuck outta here.

01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:44.103
- Yo, yo, no hospital.

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:46.743
they match that bullet

01:25:46.743 --> 01:25:48.540
to one of these guys out here.

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.190
We all fucked.

01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:52.181
- Yeah we know what we doing.

01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:53.014
- Aight.

01:25:57.230 --> 01:25:58.400
- what's rule number one?

01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.961
- never be greedy!

01:25:59.961 --> 01:26:02.628
(upbeat music)

01:26:23.729 --> 01:26:24.562
- Hey Nicole!

01:26:24.562 --> 01:26:26.479
- Hey, what's going on?

01:26:27.618 --> 01:26:28.785
Wait a second.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.230
Don't tell me

01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:39.120

01:26:40.267 --> 01:26:41.100

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.599
No.

01:26:42.599 --> 01:26:44.555
I'm in actual physical pain.

01:26:44.555 --> 01:26:45.530
- Oh

01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:47.593
- My mom's fine.

01:26:48.639 --> 01:26:50.210
- Oh I'm Sorry,

01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:51.060

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:51.960

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.106
I thought.

01:26:53.106 --> 01:26:56.980
- No heh I'm transferring her out

01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:01.313
to live with me in
house care out of state.

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:04.500
You were right.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.400
We both deserve a chance at redemption

01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:09.080
- Look at you.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.770
