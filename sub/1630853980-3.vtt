WEBVTT

00:15.933 --> 00:18.060
Her Majesty's Royal Guard! Open up!

00:35.327 --> 00:36.745
Is there any word?

00:36.828 --> 00:40.082
She's completely evaded our dogs,
Ayuras and Scentiers.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.960
Either she's managed to flee the city,
or she's very well hidden.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.044
Who else knows?

00:44.127 --> 00:46.713
Only the Royal Guard,
but they're sworn to secrecy.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.341
Which means the nobles will know soon,
if they don't already.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.593
And when the nobles know,
their staffs will know.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.761
Word will spread.

00:55.013 --> 00:59.059
If Trovere finds out about this,
there will be no avoiding a war.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.895
We need to get her out of the city
before news reaches the court.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.689
She's been promised Sibeth today.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.441
How did it even come to this?

01:06.525 --> 01:08.318
A peace treaty between two nations

01:08.402 --> 01:11.029
hanging on revenge
against one awful woman?

01:14.408 --> 01:19.496
Tamacti, these God Thunder weapons
that Baba speaks of,

01:19.580 --> 01:20.998
what are your thoughts?

01:21.790 --> 01:23.417
I don't know what to think about it.

01:24.376 --> 01:28.297
Baba Voss is a great warrior,
but he's been through a lot.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.424
Maybe he's confused.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.093
It doesn't matter. Someone attacked him.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.221
I will insist she go home
to seek assurances

01:36.305 --> 01:39.308
that this attack, that these weapons,
were not from Trivantes.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.768
Maghra, Trovere is no fool.
She'll know it's a stall.

01:41.852 --> 01:45.355
We need a stall to find my damn sister!

01:46.773 --> 01:50.736
Unless you can convince her
to accept something else in her stead.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.948
No, they seem pretty determined
to have her.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.075
So, what then?

01:59.161 --> 02:02.039
The ambassador is still pretty enraged
about Baba's attack.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.125
I'll give her time to settle,
then I'll approach her.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.710
What will you say?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.420
I don't know.

02:09.505 --> 02:12.216
But I think we all agree
it better be something brilliant.

02:16.011 --> 02:19.806
You're going to leave all our fates
in the hands of an idiot.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.852
Lord Harlan is many things,
but he's no idiot.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.481
If it wasn't for his influence
with Trovere,

02:27.564 --> 02:29.358
we would have been at war months ago.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.448
Must be one hell of a cock.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.825
Well, I wouldn't know.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.869
I should have been there.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.165
Not even you could have saved Paris.

04:10.209 --> 04:13.587
I would not have allowed her
to care for that demon woman.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.218
It was the baby she was caring for,
not Sibeth.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.056
I know you're upset about Paris.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.476
We've all had time to mourn her.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.068
It's not just Paris.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.196
What do you mean?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.159
They killed Bow Lion.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.788
Bow Lion?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.289
The God Thunder.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.001
She never even got a chance
to die fighting.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.921
No fight, just death.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.047
She was with you?

05:00.717 --> 05:01.760
Yes.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.434
I'm sorry.

05:10.602 --> 05:11.603
Me too.

05:20.696 --> 05:21.697
Mama?

05:23.866 --> 05:25.659
I assume you're here to let him out.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.870
Leave us to talk for a moment.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.247
-I will leave with my father.
-Haniwa, not now.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.876
Your sister killed Paris,
and you kept her in her bedroom.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.252
Him, you keep in a dungeon!

05:35.335 --> 05:38.005
If I let him out,
he will go after the ambassador again.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.381
No, he won't.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.383
-Yes, I will.
-Papa!

05:41.466 --> 05:43.635
Haniwa, leave us, please.

05:50.642 --> 05:51.935
It's okay, my love.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.407
Where is No?

06:06.867 --> 06:07.951
No?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.036
The dog.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.496
The dog?

06:12.915 --> 06:16.668
He's more comfortable than you are,
and most likely better fed.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.253
Good.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.050
And Sibeth?

06:24.301 --> 06:25.802
There's no sign of her yet.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.600
I do not understand
why you kept her alive.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.186
Was it so easy for you
to kill your brother?

06:38.857 --> 06:39.858
I'm sorry.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.945
I'm sorry, you're right.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.407
It was a mistake.
I should have killed her.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.371
Do not make another one
with the Trivantians.

06:55.123 --> 06:59.169
I have spent a long time
negotiating peace with them.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.963
And I cannot just throw it away

07:01.046 --> 07:04.424
because of a conclusion you have made
without firm evidence.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.635
They will be coming here
with these weapons,

07:06.718 --> 07:08.512
and they will flatten your kingdom!

07:08.595 --> 07:11.598
I do not doubt
that you were attacked by these weapons.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.393
-Yet you've caged me like an animal.
-You forced me to!

07:17.354 --> 07:19.147
You think I want you down here?

07:23.068 --> 07:26.738
I've spent seasons
wondering where you were,

07:26.822 --> 07:28.490
dreaming of your return.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.034
And now I am forced to lock you up?

07:32.786 --> 07:39.334
I'm just trying to hold things together
long enough to capture Sibeth,

07:39.418 --> 07:42.212
or any chance of peace will be lost.

07:44.464 --> 07:49.803
But I cannot hold it together
if you are so determined to tear it apart.

07:52.931 --> 07:57.102
I need you to trust me,
just for a little while.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.022
Can you do that?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
Yes.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.533
Good. Because there is something else
I need you to do.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.410
What?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.746
Talk to Kofun.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.334
Kofun?

08:21.210 --> 08:23.212
He needs his father, more than ever.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.929
Do you have a key?

08:32.846 --> 08:33.847
No.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.936
Then move, please.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.243
I'm sorry I broke your dungeon.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.331
Just another thing to fix.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.339
Paya was once a great and holy kingdom,

09:08.507 --> 09:10.551
where the very mention of sight was a sin.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.765
But now, our holy kingdom is corrupted

09:17.558 --> 09:19.852
by the very monarchy that built it.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.858
They have put themselves
before their people.

09:25.941 --> 09:30.279
And in so doing,
they have surrendered their birthright.

09:36.451 --> 09:42.749
I served Wolffe Kane, a great king
who is surely spinning in his grave.

09:43.876 --> 09:48.505
His daughters have betrayed him,
and they have betrayed us.

09:49.590 --> 09:53.135
And because he is not here
to right the wrongs of his daughters,

09:53.218 --> 09:54.720
we will do it for him.

09:57.556 --> 10:02.811
The time has come for us to rise up
as a people, as true believers,

10:03.520 --> 10:05.564
and rid Pennsa of these witches.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.400
Thanks.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.570
We must wipe out
the bastard children

10:11.653 --> 10:13.947
of Maghra and Sibeth Kane!

11:34.945 --> 11:35.946
Chet-chet.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.036
-Fucking witch!
-I got him!

11:43.120 --> 11:44.288
Hold him still.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.920
Kofun!

11:56.383 --> 11:57.801
That's enough of that!

12:00.929 --> 12:01.930
Kofun!

12:03.515 --> 12:04.516
Dad?

12:05.559 --> 12:07.853
Kofun. Are you hurt?

12:07.936 --> 12:11.356
No. It's just a cut. I'm fine.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.025
-Let me feel.
-No, I said I'm fine!

12:14.860 --> 12:15.944
Why are you here?

12:18.989 --> 12:20.782
I heard this is where I could find you.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.994
No, I mean, why are you back here at all?

12:28.790 --> 12:29.791
We should speak.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.836
Your mother has told me
all that has happened.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.257
Then we don't need to speak.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.388
Kofun! Listen to me. Please.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.934
Baba Voss! You got a dog.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.564
Go away.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.569
Kofun?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.739
Yeah, Ma, I'm here. I'm fine.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.244
You should have told me he was back.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.622
-How many were there?
-We picked up four of them.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.790
I said I'm fine.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.670
If that blade had gone any deeper,
he would be dead.

13:16.296 --> 13:20.425
This? After Haniwa was grabbed,
then nearly burned in the street?

13:21.426 --> 13:23.220
The Witchfinders have grown too bold.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.389
If it was Witchfinders
that had attacked him,

13:25.472 --> 13:26.723
the boy would be dead.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.184
-Beg to differ.
-This is still their doing.

13:29.268 --> 13:33.397
Their insurgency is giving other people
the nerve to act against my children.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.650
-I want every last one of them arrested.
-To what end?

13:37.985 --> 13:40.529
I am going to hang them for treason.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.700
Give us space.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.160
Now!

13:49.955 --> 13:52.291
Go.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.761
You're angry. I understand that.
Your family was threatened.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.514
But you can't go rounding up
and executing citizens

14:07.598 --> 14:08.682
without due process.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.976
Don't think like a parent,
think like a queen,

14:11.059 --> 14:12.060
the queen that you are.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.855
Sometimes a queen must do terrible things
for the good of her kingdom.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.023
You sound like your sister.

14:16.106 --> 14:21.069
Well, maybe she was right!
No one dared defy her the way they do me.

14:22.029 --> 14:26.575
I spent 20 years as the unquestioning tip
of Sibeth's blade.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.951
I'll not do it again.

14:29.077 --> 14:33.415
If you so command me,
I relinquish my post.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.463
Then I will not so command you.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.924
Captain Gosset!

14:42.007 --> 14:43.008
My queen.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.678
Take your men and bring me
every last one of them.

14:46.762 --> 14:49.264
I will not fear
for my own children's lives

14:49.348 --> 14:50.682
in my own kingdom.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.434
Yes, my queen.

15:15.624 --> 15:19.837
What is the point in waiting
for Ambassador Trovere's return?

15:20.462 --> 15:23.298
Her delay clearly demonstrates

15:23.799 --> 15:27.344
that Pennsa has no intention in honoring
the terms of our truce.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.847
Trovere is a seasoned diplomat.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.016
If they are resisting,
she will negotiate her way to our terms.

15:33.100 --> 15:37.938
Our terms are more beneficial
to the Payans than us.

15:38.021 --> 15:42.234
They have become too confident
in the aftermath of Greenhill Gap.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.321
Trivantes is by far
the superior military power.

15:46.405 --> 15:50.492
All we need to do
is give them a taste of defeat,

15:50.576 --> 15:53.328
and the terms will change significantly.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.789
General Voss held the same opinion,

15:55.873 --> 15:58.584
which is what led to Greenhill Gap
in the first place.

15:58.667 --> 16:04.047
Edo underestimated the Payan forces,
but that does not mean he was wrong.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.843
We've defeated the Ganite hordes,
we're at full strength,

16:07.926 --> 16:10.512
and we should be negotiating
from that position.

16:10.596 --> 16:12.264
What does The Bank think?

16:14.516 --> 16:18.228
Far be it from me
to weigh in on military solutions.

16:18.312 --> 16:22.274
But for now,
there's simply too much we don't know.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.195
Trovere either will return with the queen
or she won't.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.238
Either way, we'll know what to do then.

16:28.322 --> 16:31.575
And by then, they will be ready for us.

16:31.658 --> 16:35.329
Which shouldn't matter
if, as you say, we are at full strength.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.414
I say we wait.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.168
The People agrees with The Bank.

16:44.421 --> 16:47.674
The Military concedes to the majority.

16:51.220 --> 16:54.598
I've decided you and Kofun
shouldn't leave the palace right now.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.849
It's too dangerous.

16:56.808 --> 16:57.809
Okay.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.854
Okay, you'll stay inside?

17:01.730 --> 17:02.731
No.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.442
Haniwa, it's not safe out there.

17:05.526 --> 17:06.609
It never has been.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.194
Ouch! Charlotte!

17:09.905 --> 17:11.198
Is someone in your room?

17:12.616 --> 17:13.617
No.

17:14.326 --> 17:17.204
Wrong. Stay back.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.384
Stop!

17:32.010 --> 17:33.220
It's Wren.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.189
I never thought I'd see you again.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.191
I know.

17:53.282 --> 17:57.995
So, I'm thinking
I should probably leave now, right?

18:00.080 --> 18:01.081
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

18:16.388 --> 18:19.850
What happened to you? Why are you here?

18:21.476 --> 18:22.519
We need to talk.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.397
Okay.

18:28.317 --> 18:32.863
It's okay. It's all right.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.866
Hey, listen to this. Yeah.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.829
Hey, it's all right.

18:40.913 --> 18:43.707
Hey, it's okay.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.168
Yes, it is.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.379
What?

18:51.089 --> 18:55.010
I heard the baby crying.
I thought maybe you needed some help.

18:55.761 --> 18:57.596
Just trying to soothe him.

18:58.931 --> 19:00.307
Sounds like you're torturing him.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.060
I have done this before, you know.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.144
Yes.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.898
And they still haven't stopped
their whining.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.947
Here. Give him to me.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.788
Hi, Wolffe. Hi.

19:23.705 --> 19:27.459
I'm Charlotte. Hi, baby.

19:29.211 --> 19:33.841
I don't know what's bothering him.
It's like he knows I'm not his mother.

19:33.924 --> 19:39.012
No. All he knows is
he has gas he can't expel.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.975
There you go.

19:45.978 --> 19:47.145
Fart away, little man.

19:47.646 --> 19:48.689
You're good with him.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.400
I like them until they can speak.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.360
Do you want him back?

19:53.443 --> 19:54.486
No.

19:55.571 --> 19:59.491
Please, he's happy with you. Stay.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.535
Okay.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.081
Hi.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.627
Do you have any children of your own?

20:11.336 --> 20:12.337
If I did,

20:12.421 --> 20:15.757
I wouldn't be running all over the place
trying to keep yours out of trouble.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.637
I always thought
I would wanna have a daughter.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.225
Maybe name her for a flower.

20:27.186 --> 20:30.689
Lily. Rose.

20:35.319 --> 20:39.489
But this life, The Compass…

20:41.825 --> 20:43.327
it's all I've ever known.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.664
It's all I have to offer a child.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.755
If I were to go to the trouble
of bringing someone into this world…

20:57.424 --> 21:01.970
I'd wanna have more to offer them.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.765
I think you have more to offer
than you think.

21:18.737 --> 21:22.533
Charlotte, I don't know
if I've ever thanked you

21:22.616 --> 21:24.284
for protecting my children.

21:24.785 --> 21:26.995
I do. You have not.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.667
Well, please know that I am very grateful.

21:34.503 --> 21:38.257
There is no need. It's my sacred mission.

21:41.885 --> 21:43.846
-Mama.
-What? What is it?

21:43.929 --> 21:46.223
I need you to come with me. Right now.

21:47.808 --> 21:49.142
We're fine. You go.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.836
So the weapons are real.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.880
Baba, you were right.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.465
With one hand, the Triangle seeks peace,

22:20.549 --> 22:22.926
while the other plans our destruction.

22:23.635 --> 22:25.220
No, that's not true.

22:25.304 --> 22:27.431
Well, not entirely.

22:28.015 --> 22:29.808
This isn't the Triangle.

22:29.892 --> 22:32.603
It's a rogue military scientist
named Tormada.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.521
Tormada?

22:35.939 --> 22:36.982
You know him?

22:38.358 --> 22:42.279
He's a man with no soul.
He would kill thousands.

22:46.575 --> 22:48.410
I didn't recognize his voice…

22:50.412 --> 22:52.206
but it is he who killed Bow Lion.

22:54.124 --> 22:57.628
How can we fight him if these weapons
are as powerful as you say they are?

22:57.711 --> 23:01.632
The bombs. We have to destroy them
before they can be used.

23:01.715 --> 23:04.009
We have to go back
to the House of Enlightenment.

23:05.427 --> 23:08.138
So Jerlamarel is building weapons
for the Trivantians.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.265
Jerlamarel is dead.

23:10.766 --> 23:11.767
What?

23:12.684 --> 23:15.312
Edo killed him,
and then forced his children

23:15.395 --> 23:18.065
to build the bombs
under Tormada's supervision.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.569
Mom.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.740
We need to go.

23:27.282 --> 23:31.370
We can destroy the bombs.
We can save our brothers and sisters.

23:31.954 --> 23:34.248
You mean the ones that gave you to Edo?

23:34.915 --> 23:38.460
Oloman was forced to do that,
and to build the bombs.

23:38.961 --> 23:41.088
He died so I could escape to warn you.

23:41.171 --> 23:44.216
This Tormada, he will just make more.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.759
He can't, without the children.

23:45.843 --> 23:48.428
The process of refining the coal
requires sight.

23:48.512 --> 23:50.514
He needs them to make the weapons.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.516
And you wonder why they fear us.

23:53.225 --> 23:55.269
Did you say
the weapons are made from coal?

23:56.103 --> 23:57.104
Yes.

23:58.564 --> 24:01.066
I will have Tamacti Jun take
a battalion to take the house.

24:02.234 --> 24:05.070
They will hear them coming
from a thousand heartbeats away.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.657
I will go with Haniwa and Kofun.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.951
They know the house and the grounds.

24:11.535 --> 24:13.453
And we will free
the children of Jerlamarel,

24:13.537 --> 24:15.539
and they will tell us
how to destroy these weapons.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.458
You want to bring our children
back to that place?

24:21.211 --> 24:24.548
They are not the children they were
when they first went there.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.091
They're adults now.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.429
-Warriors.
-Well, you are injured.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.598
I'm always injured.

24:36.059 --> 24:40.647
First Paris, and now Bow Lion.

24:43.275 --> 24:45.360
I cannot bear to lose one of you.

24:47.696 --> 24:50.449
But we cannot let
their deaths have been for nothing.

24:52.951 --> 24:56.914
You will all have a full night's sleep,
and then leave first thing in the morning.

24:59.374 --> 25:00.375
Thank you, Mama.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.127
Come on.

25:08.926 --> 25:10.177
I should have believed you.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.434
We were both right.
We were also both wrong.

25:21.146 --> 25:23.232
So, what do you think?

25:24.983 --> 25:25.984
About what?

25:27.277 --> 25:30.364
Haniwa. And her woman.

25:32.658 --> 25:34.201
She had to fall for a Trivantian?

25:36.828 --> 25:38.080
She takes after her mother.

25:39.039 --> 25:41.792
Yeah, we all know
how well that worked out.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.716
-Ambassador?
-Yes.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.593
Lord Harlan requests an audience.

25:53.303 --> 25:54.513
I will receive him.

25:56.014 --> 25:57.015
Enter.

26:00.394 --> 26:01.478
Come to say goodbye?

26:07.734 --> 26:08.819
You lied to me.

26:08.902 --> 26:10.988
-Harlan.
-The weapons Baba Voss spoke of are real.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.656
The Trivantians are planning an attack.

26:12.739 --> 26:13.991
Have you lost your mind?

26:14.074 --> 26:17.327
Tormada. A man named Tormada built them.

26:17.828 --> 26:20.289
If you lie to me, I will slit your throat.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.293
I know you too well.

26:24.376 --> 26:25.544
Not as well as you think.

26:25.627 --> 26:28.964
Oh, yes, I do. And you know me too,

26:29.047 --> 26:31.550
well enough to know
I would not betray you.

26:36.013 --> 26:38.932
Well, kill me or kiss me,
but for fuck's sake, do something already.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.234
I had to be sure.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.070
And are you?

26:53.488 --> 26:54.489
Yeah.

27:01.288 --> 27:02.748
I've heard of Tormada.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.876
He's one of the Military's top scientists.

27:05.959 --> 27:09.796
He is an extremist, but it's been a while
since he's made any noise.

27:09.880 --> 27:13.467
Well, apparently he's been pretty busy
building weapons that can flatten cities.

27:13.550 --> 27:14.676
How can that even be?

27:14.760 --> 27:16.553
I don't know.

27:16.637 --> 27:19.806
These weapons are made
using large quantities of coal.

27:22.184 --> 27:24.102
So that's why your knife was at my throat.

27:24.186 --> 27:25.187
Yeah.

27:26.355 --> 27:29.191
Pretty much all the coal smuggled
into Trivantes comes from me,

27:29.274 --> 27:31.401
which means it comes from you.

27:31.485 --> 27:34.279
A portion of my shipments
do go to the Military.

27:34.363 --> 27:35.781
It's how I keep the routes open.

27:35.864 --> 27:40.118
Military?
You think he's in league with Tormada?

27:43.497 --> 27:47.251
It's possible.
Greenhill Gap was an embarrassment.

27:47.334 --> 27:50.504
The Military has made no secret
of his desire for a show of force.

27:52.673 --> 27:56.260
If a rogue faction of my government
is planning to march on Paya,

27:56.343 --> 27:58.387
it will mean not only a war
with your country,

27:58.470 --> 27:59.805
but a civil war in mine.

28:01.181 --> 28:02.182
Great.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.185
So how do we stop it?

28:10.232 --> 28:11.733
I will leave with Sibeth today.

28:13.652 --> 28:15.404
Once I've supplied
the last barrier to peace,

28:15.487 --> 28:17.823
they'll sign the treaty as agreed.

28:17.906 --> 28:21.869
If the Military objects,
we will know where he stands.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.746
-No.
-No?

28:26.164 --> 28:28.625
The queen will not let her sister go

28:29.126 --> 28:32.921
until you've provided assurances
that this insurrection has been put down.

28:33.005 --> 28:35.299
The queen is in no position
to make such a demand.

28:35.382 --> 28:37.259
Nevertheless, she has made it.

28:38.385 --> 28:40.971
If I leave without Sibeth,
then war is inevitable.

28:42.973 --> 28:45.726
Not if you expose a rogue faction.

28:45.809 --> 28:48.770
Prevent a civil war.
You'll be hailed as a hero.

28:49.479 --> 28:50.480
Or buried as one.

28:52.441 --> 28:53.442
Come with me.

28:54.193 --> 28:55.402
To Trivantes?

28:56.069 --> 28:58.197
I may need you to support my argument.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.073
Yeah, who's gonna listen to me?

29:00.157 --> 29:03.160
You need this peace even more than we do.
They know that.

29:03.243 --> 29:04.745
It gives you credibility.

29:04.828 --> 29:08.081
Plus, you have your networks.
They can help us track the coal.

29:08.749 --> 29:11.043
I can bring you in
as an official emissary.

29:12.419 --> 29:16.381
It's risky.
I could be grabbed, used as leverage.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.431
I don't want my presence known about
unless it has to be.

29:26.934 --> 29:28.602
How? I don't understand.

29:29.436 --> 29:32.356
I've been sneaking into Trivantes
since I was a boy.

29:33.398 --> 29:36.777
If you are discovered,
they will execute you as a spy.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.820
Well, then I'd better be quiet.

29:41.490 --> 29:42.950
This is a terrible idea.

29:44.535 --> 29:45.702
I agree.

29:46.954 --> 29:48.455
We should leave immediately.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.388
You don't have to be quiet.
He's awake.

30:09.726 --> 30:10.978
Why is he in here?

30:12.062 --> 30:14.064
The stench of her is everywhere.

30:14.731 --> 30:18.193
Her scent is what comforts him,
for better or for worse.

30:20.237 --> 30:22.781
Yes. There's my boy.

30:23.824 --> 30:25.617
Come to Papa Baba.

30:26.743 --> 30:27.911
Papa Baba.

30:32.082 --> 30:34.585
-You've heard about these bombs?
-Yes.

30:36.003 --> 30:37.504
Tomorrow, we go to destroy them.

30:39.464 --> 30:42.634
If that's an invitation, then I accept.

30:48.432 --> 30:50.267
Thank you, Charlotte.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.019
You're welcome, Baba Voss.

30:52.603 --> 30:55.355
We would be lost without you, Charlotte.

30:55.439 --> 30:58.525
Oh, Baba, you flatter me.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.707
What are you doing with him?

31:15.709 --> 31:16.710
Kofun.

31:18.337 --> 31:20.047
He's my grandson, is he not?

31:26.553 --> 31:27.763
There is your papa.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.059
Yes.

31:34.353 --> 31:35.604
Come to me.

31:36.813 --> 31:40.400
You know,
the day you and your sister were born,

31:41.527 --> 31:43.153
Witchfinders attacked our village.

31:44.321 --> 31:46.823
Many died, and we fled.

31:48.116 --> 31:51.745
Your first night was spent in a forest,

31:52.829 --> 31:55.040
and I stood guard that cold night.

31:56.667 --> 32:01.088
And every rush of wind through the trees
sounded like the breath of a Witchfinder.

32:05.342 --> 32:08.053
I had been a father for less than a day,

32:09.680 --> 32:11.807
and I already thought
that I had failed you,

32:13.141 --> 32:14.768
that I could not protect my children.

32:17.771 --> 32:19.189
That fear never goes away.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.527
But I have learned to embrace it.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.281
It is what makes us a father.

32:29.491 --> 32:31.577
I don't know
that I'm supposed to be a father.

32:33.245 --> 32:34.288
Not like this.

32:36.665 --> 32:37.666
Oh, son.

32:42.337 --> 32:45.591
You will find a way, as all fathers do.

32:47.342 --> 32:48.343
How?

32:52.306 --> 32:53.557
There is no great secret.

32:55.058 --> 32:58.896
You'll be scared… often.

33:00.147 --> 33:01.273
That's part of it.

33:04.818 --> 33:07.863
Fatherhood is a different kind of battle,

33:08.864 --> 33:10.365
one that you wage with your heart.

33:12.534 --> 33:15.078
And you, Kofun,

33:15.162 --> 33:17.539
you have the strongest heart
of any man I've ever met.

33:19.583 --> 33:20.584
Now take him.

33:32.387 --> 33:33.972
Your battle begins today, son.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.045
All that time in Wolf's Cliff…

34:07.130 --> 34:08.257
what did you do?

34:12.969 --> 34:14.429
I hunted,

34:15.556 --> 34:16.764
climbed,

34:18.350 --> 34:19.768
dreamed of you.

34:20.936 --> 34:24.356
You didn't have to dream of me.
You knew where I was.

34:27.234 --> 34:31.905
In my dreams, you are not here.
We're far from here.

34:38.829 --> 34:40.664
I know you're not happy here,

34:42.248 --> 34:44.251
but maybe one day you could be,

34:45.210 --> 34:47.462
when we're not living
under the threat of war.

34:52.384 --> 34:55.469
Kingdoms and countries
will always be under threat, my love.

35:00.642 --> 35:04.897
Do you even remember what it felt like
to live away from all of this?

35:07.941 --> 35:10.861
Quiet, peace…

35:13.197 --> 35:14.323
all together.

35:16.325 --> 35:18.076
Our children just a shout away.

35:20.579 --> 35:21.830
The world has changed.

35:24.708 --> 35:25.709
No.

35:26.210 --> 35:30.631
The world is still there.
We just can't sense it from here.

35:51.235 --> 35:52.236
Wren?

35:56.323 --> 35:57.407
What is it?

36:10.212 --> 36:14.800
I keep seeing the soldiers,
when the bombs went off.

36:17.427 --> 36:19.930
One minute they were standing there,
and the next…

36:22.057 --> 36:23.267
they were just…

36:25.727 --> 36:27.020
torn to pieces…

36:30.023 --> 36:31.108
burned to ash.

36:35.237 --> 36:36.947
I can't get it out of my head.

36:43.036 --> 36:45.330
Being able to see isn't always a gift.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.459
I don't know that it ever is.

36:56.550 --> 36:57.551
Wren?

37:09.354 --> 37:10.689
I'm a deserter.

37:12.858 --> 37:13.859
What?

37:15.277 --> 37:18.530
I left my battalion,
and that's punishable by death.

37:22.701 --> 37:23.952
I can never go back.

37:26.997 --> 37:28.749
I will never see my family again.

37:32.211 --> 37:33.879
They will be told that I'm a coward.

37:36.507 --> 37:37.883
And they'll be shamed.

37:38.634 --> 37:42.346
If your parents know you,
they will know that that isn't true.

37:50.729 --> 37:51.813
Every time…

37:53.190 --> 37:55.108
I hear your dad speak…

37:59.279 --> 38:01.198
I hear Edo's voice.

38:12.835 --> 38:13.836
You miss him.

38:17.089 --> 38:18.549
He was like a father to me.

38:25.639 --> 38:27.140
He built these bombs.

38:32.187 --> 38:33.188
I know.

38:39.194 --> 38:40.404
I still love him.

38:44.408 --> 38:45.492
What does that make me?

38:46.827 --> 38:47.995
Oh, my love.

38:53.417 --> 38:54.418
Here.

39:03.385 --> 39:08.223
It makes you human,
just like the rest of us.

40:23.131 --> 40:24.758
I was afraid you weren't coming.

40:26.176 --> 40:27.469
I had to be careful.

40:36.728 --> 40:38.063
Have you found a safe place?

40:39.815 --> 40:43.735
Not yet. Something came up.
But I brought enough food for a few days.

40:43.819 --> 40:47.030
A few days? No. You promised.

40:47.114 --> 40:48.240
Just let me out of here!

40:49.241 --> 40:52.160
I will. As soon as I'm back.

40:53.161 --> 40:56.915
Back? Where are you going?
What's more important than this?

40:56.999 --> 40:58.375
Keeping Wolffe alive.

41:01.545 --> 41:03.839
The Trivantians have made
these new weapons.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.592
Thunder and fire.

41:06.675 --> 41:09.052
They can destroy the entire city
and all of Paya.

41:10.846 --> 41:13.724
What? What are you talking about?

41:13.807 --> 41:15.601
Sibeth, I don't have time to explain.

41:16.977 --> 41:18.103
I want my baby.

41:19.146 --> 41:21.440
I don't care what you want.

41:22.316 --> 41:25.652
I am not doing this for you.
I'm doing it for Wolffe.

41:28.697 --> 41:32.701
I can't let them kill his mother,
even if she deserves it.

41:37.789 --> 41:40.125
-Kofun.
-Just shut up and stay put.

41:41.460 --> 41:42.836
I'll be back in a few days.

41:45.130 --> 41:46.548
What if you don't come back?

41:48.550 --> 41:49.968
Then we're all dead anyway.

41:56.141 --> 41:57.142
You heard?

42:02.814 --> 42:03.815
Yes.

42:05.108 --> 42:06.735
We may have to make some other plans.

42:07.319 --> 42:09.196
They are already in process, my queen.

42:11.490 --> 42:12.616
A gift for you.

42:32.094 --> 42:33.428
A perfect fit.

42:35.764 --> 42:37.140
Thank you, Harmony.

42:41.770 --> 42:45.440
Those Trivantian weapons he mentioned,
fire and thunder.

42:46.191 --> 42:47.860
I have heard whispers in the palace.

42:48.443 --> 42:51.697
Find out what you can.
Might be interesting.

42:52.906 --> 42:53.907
Yes, my queen.

43:13.427 --> 43:14.428
Gate!

43:24.855 --> 43:25.939
Lucien Bray.

43:27.649 --> 43:28.817
Tamacti Jun.

43:30.485 --> 43:32.362
I hope you're pleased.

43:32.446 --> 43:33.447
Far from it.

43:34.323 --> 43:35.741
You chose the wrong side.

43:36.283 --> 43:38.368
You're the one standing ready to swing.

43:39.536 --> 43:42.247
And you'll be called to answer
for my death,

43:42.331 --> 43:43.415
for all of our deaths.

43:45.959 --> 43:48.045
I have enough to answer for. We all do.

43:48.128 --> 43:49.129
Give us space.

43:57.679 --> 44:00.516
Recant your position, all of you,

44:02.017 --> 44:04.937
and I'm confident
I can convince the queen to spare you.

44:07.231 --> 44:08.232
I can't do that.

44:09.066 --> 44:10.192
You're dying for nothing.

44:10.275 --> 44:13.654
I am dying for my vow to the God Flame.

44:13.737 --> 44:18.575
That you call it nothing tells me
just how lost you truly are.

44:20.285 --> 44:24.623
There was a time that you would have
proudly died beside me.

44:24.706 --> 44:27.000
We were deceived, Lucien.

44:28.460 --> 44:33.173
Pledged to a woman who used the God Flame
as an excuse to murder.

44:33.257 --> 44:35.592
And how does this one excuse her murders?

44:35.676 --> 44:37.010
I'm trying to help you.

44:37.094 --> 44:38.095
Help me?

44:39.388 --> 44:40.889
You can't even help yourself.

44:42.683 --> 44:44.768
Now, if there's nothing else…

44:47.020 --> 44:48.647
I have a hanging to get to.

44:55.195 --> 44:56.196
Gate!

44:58.532 --> 44:59.533
Get in there!

45:02.202 --> 45:05.330
This land is your land

45:06.582 --> 45:09.418
This land is my land

45:10.669 --> 45:13.839
From the lowly valleys

45:14.715 --> 45:17.593
To the mountain highlands

45:19.553 --> 45:21.388
From the hidden forest

45:23.265 --> 45:25.434
To the salty waters

45:27.853 --> 45:31.523
This land was made for you and me

45:34.193 --> 45:37.029
This land was made

45:43.535 --> 45:46.079
I have to go.
I'll be back in a little bit.

46:26.286 --> 46:28.622
These three former Witchfinders,

46:29.414 --> 46:32.376
Nellicut, Wallen, Yarnes,

46:34.086 --> 46:35.420
stand before you,

46:36.672 --> 46:41.593
judged for the murder
of an innocent Payan citizen, Row Vano,

46:42.219 --> 46:46.306
burning him alive because they suspected
he might be sighted.

46:48.141 --> 46:52.771
The penalty for murder
is death by hanging.

47:59.254 --> 48:02.549
And now, the rest of you, rise.

48:05.844 --> 48:09.264
The kingdom of Paya
no longer recognizes witches.

48:10.265 --> 48:12.434
You have defied the royal edict

48:12.935 --> 48:15.938
and openly called
for the death of those with sight.

48:17.606 --> 48:21.235
Violation of your queen's edict
is punishable by death.

48:24.738 --> 48:25.739
But…

48:27.741 --> 48:32.871
we have all experienced
more than enough death as of late.

48:34.540 --> 48:39.294
And you are all still the same soldiers
who fought heroically at Greenhill Gap.

48:41.421 --> 48:42.422
You shall live,

48:43.298 --> 48:46.552
not with a warning, but with a promise.

48:48.971 --> 48:51.390
If you violate the royal edict again,

48:51.473 --> 48:54.393
if you continue to gather
and foment rebellion,

48:54.476 --> 48:58.897
you and your families will suffer
far more than these men did today.

49:02.985 --> 49:03.986
Go home.

49:13.579 --> 49:14.580
Wise decision.

49:15.706 --> 49:16.707
Time will tell.

49:53.035 --> 49:54.953
Be silent as a spider.

49:56.038 --> 49:57.039
Kofun?

50:03.420 --> 50:05.297
Welcome back, Baba Voss.

50:06.840 --> 50:07.841
Sibeth!

50:09.676 --> 50:11.428
You've woken the baby.

50:12.721 --> 50:13.722
There.

50:13.805 --> 50:15.307
It's only Grandpa.

50:15.390 --> 50:18.685
He's come to say goodbye
before Mama takes you on a trip.

50:20.896 --> 50:25.150
-Put the boy down.
-Stay back or I will slice fast and hard.

50:25.234 --> 50:26.693
My blade is at his neck.

50:31.907 --> 50:32.991
He is your child.

50:33.575 --> 50:37.871
Yes, he is mine.
And I will kill him before I lose him.

50:38.622 --> 50:40.582
You would kill your own child?

50:41.708 --> 50:45.754
I'm going to be lectured on murder
by a Trivantian slaver.

50:45.838 --> 50:50.801
How many souls did you capture,
sell, kill?

50:51.301 --> 50:54.263
I'd have to drown ten Kanzuas
to compete with you.

50:54.346 --> 50:55.597
Now, let me go.

51:03.146 --> 51:06.066
You killed your own father.

51:06.149 --> 51:08.402
You killed your own brother.

51:09.236 --> 51:11.780
Will you kill your own grandchild too?

51:15.075 --> 51:19.371
There is no place you can go
that I will not find you.

51:20.539 --> 51:22.833
You couldn't find me in your own house.

51:24.418 --> 51:26.712
What the fuck is happening?

51:27.713 --> 51:28.714
Kofun.

51:31.175 --> 51:32.384
There's been a change of plans.

51:32.467 --> 51:35.220
I'm grateful for your help,
but I can no longer hide

51:35.304 --> 51:37.222
in the walls like a restless spirit.

51:37.306 --> 51:38.515
It's time to leave.

51:38.599 --> 51:40.142
-You freed her?
-Dad.

51:40.225 --> 51:42.060
Wait, Sibeth. Please, just give him to me.

51:42.144 --> 51:44.438
I can't have the same conversation twice.

51:44.521 --> 51:46.398
You see my blade at his neck. Let me pass.

51:46.481 --> 51:47.774
You're not taking my son.

51:47.858 --> 51:48.942
He is my son.

51:50.235 --> 51:52.946
I made him. I carried him.

51:53.572 --> 51:56.450
But don't worry, Wolffie will return

51:56.533 --> 51:59.161
when I take back my kingdom
and place him on the throne.

51:59.244 --> 52:01.246
You're out of your fucking mind.
That's never gonna happen.

52:01.330 --> 52:02.581
He is the child of prophecy.

52:02.664 --> 52:04.041
He can't see!

52:07.419 --> 52:09.087
There's no fucking prophecy.

52:10.672 --> 52:12.508
He doesn't have my eyes, he has yours.

52:13.550 --> 52:17.513
Which means he isn't some blessed savior,
which means you aren't chosen by God.

52:18.472 --> 52:19.473
You're lying.

52:21.141 --> 52:24.019
We promised to always
tell each other the truth.

52:24.102 --> 52:25.103
You know I'm not.

52:30.776 --> 52:35.280
Well, then you know
I will kill your blind baby.

52:35.364 --> 52:36.949
-Let me go.
-No.

52:38.075 --> 52:39.159
Kofun!

52:44.414 --> 52:46.500
Kofun, let me feel.

52:47.376 --> 52:48.669
You're bleeding badly.

52:57.302 --> 52:58.303
Kofun.
