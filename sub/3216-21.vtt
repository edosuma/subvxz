Dad's missing. I need you to help me.
I can't do this alone.

00:19.812 --> 00:23.315
DEAN: Dad's given us a job to do.
He wants us to pick up where he left off.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.359
Saving people, hunting things.

00:25.568 --> 00:27.111
SAM:
This demon killed Mom and Jess.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.822
I gotta find Dad.
I gotta find Jessica's killer.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.490
MEG: I'm Meg.
-So where you headed?

00:31.699 --> 00:34.535
No way I'm telling you.
You could be some kind of freak.

00:35.745 --> 00:37.329
Dad.

00:42.209 --> 00:45.129
JOHN: In 1835, Samuel Colt made
a special gun.

00:45.296 --> 00:47.965
They say this gun can kill anything.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.604
SAM: I have these nightmares.
And sometimes they come true.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.738
You two are all I've got...

01:10.946 --> 01:12.740
...but I guess we are stronger
as a family.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.575
We go after this damn thing. Together.

01:14.784 --> 01:16.410
(IN UNISON)
Yes, sir.

01:42.978 --> 01:46.565
Good morning. Can I help you?

01:47.566 --> 01:51.111
I kind of--
I need to talk.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.241
Well, that's what I'm here for.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.246
I've done some things.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.207
Not good things.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.168
Well, there's always forgiveness
for us if we seek it.

02:06.335 --> 02:09.463
For everyone? Are you sure?

02:11.090 --> 02:14.510
I like to say:
Salvation was created for sinners.

02:17.513 --> 02:18.889
Tell me what's on your mind.

02:20.975 --> 02:24.186
Well, I--
I've lied a lot.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
I've stolen.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.941
I've lusted.

02:29.233 --> 02:35.155
And the other day, I met this man.
A nice guy, you know?

02:36.740 --> 02:40.369
And we had a really good chat.
Sort of like this.

02:43.914 --> 02:48.127
Then I slit his throat and ripped
his heart out through his chest.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.130
Does that make me a bad person?

02:51.213 --> 02:52.631
I know what you are.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.385
You can't be here.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.013
This is hallowed ground.

02:59.221 --> 03:03.601
Please. Maybe that works in
the minor leagues...

03:03.934 --> 03:05.311
...but not with me.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.547
You throw like a girl.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.300
What do you want?

03:37.343 --> 03:39.511
The Winchesters.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.181
I haven't spoken to John
in over a year.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.768
You're wasting your time.

03:45.935 --> 03:48.729
Even if I did know where they were,
I'd never tell you.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.898
I know.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.736
(GASPING)

04:42.700 --> 04:46.120
So this is it. This is everything I know.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.540
Look, our whole lives we've been
searching for this demon, right?

04:49.748 --> 04:51.709
Not a trace, just nothing.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.213
Until about a year ago.
For the first time, I picked up a trail.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.882
-That's when you took off.
-Yeah. That's right.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.052
The demon must have come out
of hiding or hibernation.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.513
So, what's this trail you found?

05:04.722 --> 05:07.808
Starts in Arizona,
then New Jersey, California.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.768
Houses burned down to the ground.

05:10.477 --> 05:14.231
It's going after families,
just like it went after us.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.942
-Families with infants?
-Yeah.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.986
The night of the kid's
6-month birthday.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.615
-I was 6 months old that night?
-Exactly 6 months.

05:24.158 --> 05:28.328
So basically, this demon is going
after these kids for some reason.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.832
The same way it came for me?

05:33.709 --> 05:35.127
So Mom's death...

05:37.004 --> 05:38.172
...Jess, it's because of me?

05:38.380 --> 05:39.798
-We don't know that.
-Really?

05:40.007 --> 05:42.009
-I'd say we're sure.
-For the last time...

05:42.176 --> 05:44.178
-...what happened is not your fault.
-Right.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.890
-It's not my fault, but it's my problem.
-No, it's not, it's our problem.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.392
Okay. That's enough.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.902
So why is it doing it?
What does it want?

06:00.110 --> 06:02.654
Look, I wish I had more answers. I do.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.531
I've always been one step behind it.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.452
Look, I've never gotten there
in time to save....

06:14.458 --> 06:16.585
So how do we find it
before it hits again?

06:17.753 --> 06:18.879
There are signs.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.673
It took me a while to see the pattern...

06:21.882 --> 06:25.219
...but in the days before these fires,
signs crop up in an area.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.222
Cattle deaths,
temperature fluctuations...

06:28.388 --> 06:30.432
...electrical storms.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.394
And then I went back
and checked, and....

06:34.478 --> 06:36.855
These things happened in Lawrence.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.525
A week before your mother died.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.488
And in Palo Alto...

06:48.242 --> 06:50.035
...before Jessica.

06:50.494 --> 06:53.122
And these signs,
they're starting again.

06:55.457 --> 06:59.628
-Where?
-Salvation, Iowa.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.413
-Goddamn it.
-What is it?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.748
-Son of a bitch.
-What is it?

07:37.499 --> 07:39.668
-I just got a call from Caleb.
-Is he okay?

07:39.877 --> 07:42.504
He's fine. Jim Murphy's dead.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.257
Pastor Jim?

07:46.466 --> 07:50.345
-How?
-Throat was slashed.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.930
He bled out.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.812
Caleb said they found traces of sulfur
at Jim's place.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.647
A demon.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.526
-The demon?
-I don't know.

08:04.776 --> 08:08.405
Could be he just got--
He got careless, he slipped up.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.618
Maybe the demon knows
we're getting close.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.622
-What do you wanna do?
-Now we act like every second counts.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.833
There's two hospitals and
a health center in this county.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.085
We split up, we cover more ground.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.422
I want records. I want a list
of every infant...

08:25.505 --> 08:27.549
...that's gonna be 6 months old
in the next week.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.594
That could be dozens of kids.
How the hell are we gonna know...

08:30.677 --> 08:33.764
-...which one's the right one?
-We'll check them all, that's how.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.475
You got any better ideas?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.520
No, sir.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.935
-Meet me there at midnight tonight.
-That's impossible.

19:46.144 --> 19:49.188
I can't get there in time
and I can't just carry a gun on a plane.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.816
Oh, then I guess your friends die,
don't they?

19:54.277 --> 19:58.156
If you do decide to make it,
come alone.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.458
What the hell are you looking at?

20:09.500 --> 20:14.255
-So you think Meg is a demon?
-Either that, or she's possessed by one.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.549
-It doesn't really matter.
-What do we do?

20:16.758 --> 20:18.635
-I'm going to Lincoln.
-What?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.470
Doesn't seem like I have a choice.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.890
If I don't go, a lot of people die.
Our friends die.

20:24.098 --> 20:27.435
Dad, the demon is coming tonight
for Monica and her family.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.646
That gun is all we got.
You can't just hand it over.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.731
Who said anything
about handing it over?

20:31.940 --> 20:34.859
Besides us and a couple vampires,
no one's really seen the gun.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.987
-No one knows what it looks like.
-So, what, you're just gonna...

20:38.154 --> 20:40.740
-...pick up a ringer at a pawnshop?
-Antique store.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.452
You hand Meg a fake gun
and hope she doesn't notice?

20:44.661 --> 20:48.247
Look, as long as it's close, she shouldn't
be able to tell the difference.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.750
For how long?
What happens when she figures it out?

20:50.917 --> 20:54.712
I just-- I just need to buy
a few hours, that's all.

20:55.672 --> 20:56.881
You mean, for Dean and me.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.262
You want us to stay here...

21:05.765 --> 21:07.725
...and kill this demon by ourselves?

21:07.809 --> 21:09.811
No, Sam.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.939
I wanna stop losing people we love.

21:13.147 --> 21:17.068
I want you to go to school.
I want-- I want Dean to have a home.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.742
I want Mary alive.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.540
I just--

21:33.418 --> 21:35.753
I just want this to be over.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.413
Did you get it?

22:23.551 --> 22:25.094
You know this is a trap,
don't you?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.849
That's why Meg wants you
to come alone.

22:30.058 --> 22:32.769
I can handle her.
I got a whole arsenal loaded.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.896
-Holy water, Mandaic amulets....
-Dad....

22:35.730 --> 22:36.856
What?

22:37.857 --> 22:40.735
-Promise me something.
-What's that?

22:41.778 --> 22:44.113
This thing goes south,
just get the hell out.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.910
Don't get yourself killed, all right?
You're no good to us dead.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.290
Same goes for you.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.711
All right, listen to me.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.840
They made the bullets special
for this Colt.

23:03.633 --> 23:07.637
There's only four of them left,
and without them this gun is useless.

23:11.099 --> 23:14.435
-You make every shot count.
-Yes, sir.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.273
I've been waiting
a long time for this fight.

23:20.274 --> 23:23.945
Now it's here,
and I'm not gonna be in it.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.907
It's up to you boys now.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.246
It's your fight. You finish this.

23:33.454 --> 23:37.458
You finish what I started.
You understand?

23:58.396 --> 23:59.814
We'll see you soon, Dad.

24:04.986 --> 24:06.112
I'll see you later.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.181
Later.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.269
Maybe we could tell them
there's a gas leak.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.980
Might get them out of the house
for a few hours.

26:04.188 --> 26:07.233
Yeah, and how many times
has that actually worked for us?

26:07.858 --> 26:09.235
Yeah.

26:12.613 --> 26:15.199
We could always tell them the truth.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.246
-No.
-No, I know, I know.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.999
I know. I know. I just....

26:23.624 --> 26:27.169
-With what's coming for these people....
-We only got one move and you know it.

26:27.378 --> 26:30.131
We gotta wait for that demon
to show itself and then...

26:30.339 --> 26:32.133
...we get it before it gets them.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.724
I wonder how Dad is doing.

26:42.184 --> 26:45.438
I'd feel a lot better
if we were there backing him up.

26:48.566 --> 26:51.736
I'd feel a lot better
if he were here backing us up.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.642
(PRAYING IN LATIN)

28:28.541 --> 28:30.334
This is weird.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.795
What?

28:33.712 --> 28:36.424
After all these years,
we're finally here.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.175
Doesn't seem real.

28:40.761 --> 28:44.056
We just gotta keep our heads
and do our job, like always.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.725
Yeah, but this isn't like always.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.148
True.

28:54.150 --> 28:55.359
Dean....

28:59.280 --> 29:01.282
I wanna thank you.

29:02.867 --> 29:04.243
For what?

29:07.246 --> 29:08.581
For everything.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.251
You've always had my back,
you know?

29:12.460 --> 29:15.880
Even when I couldn't count on anyone,
I could always count on you.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.048
And now....

29:19.049 --> 29:21.469
I don't know, I just wanted
to let you know.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.555
-Just in case.
-Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Are you kidding me?

29:25.264 --> 29:27.141
-What?
-Don't say, "Just in case...

29:27.224 --> 29:30.853
...something happens to you." I don't
wanna hear that freaking speech, man.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.813
Nobody's dying tonight.

29:33.022 --> 29:35.608
Not us, not that family, nobody.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.527
Except that demon.

29:38.861 --> 29:42.531
That evil son of a bitch isn't getting any
older than tonight. You understand me?

29:52.416 --> 29:53.792
(CREAKING)

29:55.127 --> 29:57.880
John. You made it.

29:58.047 --> 29:59.173
Too bad, really.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.467
I was hoping to kill more
of your friends.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.636
Sorry to disappoint.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.347
I can see where your boys
get their good looks.

30:07.765 --> 30:08.766
Though I must admit...

30:08.974 --> 30:12.728
...considering what they say about you,
I thought you'd be taller.

30:16.273 --> 30:18.734
Well, aren't you the chatty one.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.237
You wanna get to business?

30:22.404 --> 30:24.156
MEG:
Fine.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.617
Why don't you hand over the gun.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.119
If I give you the gun,
how do I get out of here?

30:29.954 --> 30:33.749
If you're as good as they say you are,
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

30:33.958 --> 30:37.127
-Maybe I'll just shoot you.
-You wanna shoot me, baby?

30:37.336 --> 30:40.005
Go ahead. It won't end anything.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.550
There's more where I came from.

30:47.638 --> 30:48.764
Who the hell's that?

30:49.265 --> 30:53.227
He's not nearly as much fun
as I am, I can tell you that.

30:53.686 --> 30:56.564
So I suggest you give us the gun.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.239
Now.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.376
This is the Colt?

31:23.924 --> 31:25.175
What do you think?

31:47.781 --> 31:49.158
You shot me!

31:50.701 --> 31:52.328
I can't believe you just shot me!

31:55.539 --> 31:56.624
It's a fake.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.557
-You're dead, John. Your boys are dead.
-I've never used the gun.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.894
-How could I know it wouldn't work?
-I'm so not in the mood for this.

32:17.061 --> 32:18.228
I've just been shot.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.981
Well, then I guess you're lucky
the gun wasn't real.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.400
That's funny, John.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.945
We're gonna strip the skin
from your bones, but that was funny.

32:29.531 --> 32:30.991
(STEAM HISSING)

33:09.363 --> 33:10.698
(YELLING)

33:13.367 --> 33:15.619
Holy water, John.

33:15.786 --> 33:17.621
Real cute.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.463
(PHONE RINGING)

33:28.882 --> 33:30.384
Dad's not answering.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.348
Maybe Meg was late.

33:36.557 --> 33:39.601
-Maybe cell reception's bad.
-Yeah, well....

33:43.397 --> 33:44.606
(STATIC ON RADIO)

33:44.982 --> 33:46.567
Dean, wait.

33:47.818 --> 33:49.361
Listen.

34:12.468 --> 34:14.261
It's coming.

34:22.519 --> 34:24.021
Damn it.

34:52.382 --> 34:53.550
Get out of my house!

34:55.010 --> 34:57.763
-Get out of my house!
-Please. Please.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.516
-Please.
DEAN: Be quiet and listen to me.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.810
Be quiet and listen.
We are trying to help you.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.603
MONICA: Charlie.
-Okay?

35:04.812 --> 35:07.189
MONICA: Everything okay down there?
-Monica, get the baby!

35:07.397 --> 35:10.317
-Don't go in the nursery!
-You stay away from her!

35:15.364 --> 35:16.990
What are you--?

35:20.661 --> 35:22.162
(GRUNTING)

35:25.624 --> 35:27.334
MONICA:
Rosie!

35:30.462 --> 35:31.505
(SCREAMING)

35:32.589 --> 35:34.132
-Where the hell did he go?
MONICA: My baby!

35:34.341 --> 35:36.301
-No. Wait.
-Get her out of here. I got it.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.136
DEAN: Take her and go.
MONICA: Rosie!

35:38.303 --> 35:40.180
-Come on.
MONICA: My baby!

35:40.389 --> 35:41.682
SAM:
Dean's got her.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.158
Aah!

36:02.786 --> 36:04.162
(GRUNTING)

36:34.776 --> 36:36.528
(COUGHING)

36:37.905 --> 36:41.533
-You get away from my family.
-No, Charlie, don't. They saved us.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.660
I mean, they saved us.

36:51.168 --> 36:52.544
Thank you.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.509
-It's still in there.
-Sam. Sam, no.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.512
-Dean, let me go. It's still in there.
-It's suicide.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.098
-I don't care.
-I do.

37:22.658 --> 37:23.784
(PHONE RINGING)

37:24.159 --> 37:27.037
DEAN: Come on, Dad.
Answer your phone, damn it.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.001
Something's wrong.

37:36.213 --> 37:40.217
-You hear me? Something's happened.
-If you had just let me go in there...

37:40.467 --> 37:43.011
...I could have ended all this.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.848
Sam, the only thing
you were gonna end was your life.

37:48.809 --> 37:50.018
You don't know that.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.981
So, what, you're just willing
to sacrifice yourself, is that it?

37:55.232 --> 37:58.402
-Yeah. Yeah, you're damn right I am.
-Well, that's not gonna happen.

37:58.568 --> 38:01.321
-Not long as I'm around.
-What are you talking about, Dean?

38:01.530 --> 38:03.991
We've been searching
for this demon our whole lives.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.575
It's the only thing
we've ever cared about.

38:05.784 --> 38:10.163
Sam, I wanna waste it. I do. Okay?
But it's not worth dying over.

38:10.539 --> 38:11.665
-What?
-I mean it.

38:12.374 --> 38:15.502
If hunting this demon
means you getting yourself killed...

38:15.711 --> 38:17.629
...I hope we never find
the damn thing.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.132
That thing killed Jess.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.261
That thing killed Mom.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.639
You said yourself once...

38:28.265 --> 38:31.059
...that no matter what we do,
they're gone.

38:31.268 --> 38:33.186
And they're never coming back.

38:34.187 --> 38:36.481
Don't you say that. Not you.

38:36.690 --> 38:39.276
Not after all this. Don't you say that.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.071
Sam, look...

38:45.240 --> 38:47.034
...the three of us...

38:48.160 --> 38:49.453
...that's all we have.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.291
And it's all I have.

38:58.587 --> 39:01.715
Sometimes I feel like
I'm barely holding it together, man.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.969
And without you or Dad, I--

39:07.554 --> 39:09.056
Dad.

39:14.686 --> 39:18.648
He should've called by now.
Try him again.

39:24.196 --> 39:26.073
(PHONE RINGING)

39:36.166 --> 39:38.585
You boys really screwed up this time.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.382
Where is he?

39:45.050 --> 39:47.803
You're never gonna see
your father again.
