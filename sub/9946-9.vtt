WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.869
With strong language,
violence and drug use.

00:04.867 --> 00:07.927
Tickets this way for
the Chatsworth Express.

00:07.917 --> 00:09.873
Come and watch pikeys
making a mess

00:09.864 --> 00:14.380
of the lives they were
given by 'im up stairs.

00:14.379 --> 00:17.849
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.841 --> 00:18.921
Stay away!

00:18.914 --> 00:22.077
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.071 --> 00:25.677
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.675 --> 00:28.235
Cos' this, people reckon,
and me included

00:28.230 --> 00:33.167
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.914
To calm us all down
to stop us going mental.

00:36.911 --> 00:41.336
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.336 --> 00:45.636
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.627 --> 00:47.834
You shit on our head.

00:47.824 --> 00:50.292
But you pay the taxes.

00:50.292 --> 00:53.364
LAUGHTER

00:53.361 --> 00:56.398
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:56.394 --> 00:58.794
who'd cum on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:58.789 --> 01:02.691
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:06.909 --> 01:08.558
(LAUGHS)

01:08.557 --> 01:10.366
Scatter.

01:10.356 --> 01:11.994
Party!

01:17.393 --> 01:21.033
In science we got told all
kinds of these 'law' things,

01:21.031 --> 01:24.341
like, "For every action there's
an equal and opposite reaction."

01:29.282 --> 01:31.294
I don't ever want to see your
faces around Chatsworth again.

01:31.388 --> 01:32.400
You got it?

01:38.073 --> 01:39.563
I've got a new one

01:39.557 --> 01:42.208
something about,
"When two bodies are on the run,

01:42.206 --> 01:45.232
"the lack of planning and the
distance they travel, is directly

01:45.223 --> 01:48.208
"proportional to how much
bullshit they're leaving behind."

01:48.398 --> 01:51.959
It was here on this very spot just
under a week ago that local teenager

01:51.956 --> 01:56.131
Ted Boden, known affectionately as
Bonehead to friends, had attended

01:56.123 --> 01:59.570
a house party after which he was
brutally attacked and later died.

01:59.568 --> 02:00.500
Please call Carl.

02:00.499 --> 02:04.503
'This seemingly unprovoked assault
has left Chatsworth residents

02:04.500 --> 02:09.961
'reeling in shock and detectives are
no closer to finding the killer.'

02:09.955 --> 02:11.446
Hey Compo grieving or not.

02:13.468 --> 02:14.503
Still no sign?

02:15.752 --> 02:16.389
Of what?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.546
Of what?
Something bad's happened.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.695
Oh, don't be daft.

02:18.687 --> 02:19.711
When?

02:19.702 --> 02:20.794
Carl's gone missing.

02:19.702 --> 02:23.229
No he's not.

02:23.219 --> 02:24.618
Guess you won't be
coming to the Jockey then?

02:23.219 --> 02:27.360
Invitation duly accepted.

02:30.271 --> 02:34.423
I bet you a packet of fig rolls
he'll be back tomorrow with
a cheeky smile on his face.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.810
He's not even checking Facebook.

02:35.806 --> 02:41.142
Look, when I was his age I followed
the Bay City Rollers on tour

02:41.138 --> 02:42.605
for ten days without telling anyone.

02:42.595 --> 02:44.495
Oh, you were considerate!

02:44.490 --> 02:48.324
Slapper! Is that where you were?!

02:48.319 --> 02:51.607
Carl always says, "See ya". Always.

03:01.259 --> 03:02.954
Still?

03:02.950 --> 03:03.871
How've you got one?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.804
Haven't.

03:07.979 --> 03:08.923
Saved this.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.061
What the fuck for?

03:10.051 --> 03:13.236
If it had been you and not Bonehead
shagging her then, bye bye, Chesney.

03:13.230 --> 03:16.154
I wouldn't have showed it everyone.

03:16.147 --> 03:18.365
Who were you calling?

03:18.365 --> 03:20.913
Anyone. Who'll come and
get us out of this shithole.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.606
Tell anyone why we left
they're in danger.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.616
Yeah, so we'll lie low. Stay out
of sight until Jimmy's nicked.

03:27.606 --> 03:29.574
Thinking with your dick
was the start of all this.

03:29.567 --> 03:30.306
You're to blame as well.

03:30.304 --> 03:31.236
Why?

03:30.304 --> 03:32.820
YOU bet I couldn't shag Sammi.

03:32.919 --> 03:35.365
This is fucking stupid.

03:36.909 --> 03:38.206
How far to the ferry?

03:38.200 --> 03:39.770
Too fucking far.

03:47.392 --> 03:50.520
Does it still count as a honeymoon
if you don't go straight away?

03:50.514 --> 03:51.685
Exactly!

03:51.675 --> 03:55.327
If you want somewhere proper it's
worth waiting for.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.732
Safari?

03:56.725 --> 03:57.635
That won't be cheap.

03:56.725 --> 03:58.602
Real baboons.

04:00.654 --> 04:03.566
His father's nose
is coming through.

04:03.556 --> 04:05.729
Go away!
I'd've knocked you right out, la!

04:06.556 --> 04:08.107
There's no need for that.

04:08.104 --> 04:09.230
Long as nana's accent stays at bay.

04:09.222 --> 04:10.359
So what're you saying?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.989
Fuck off!

04:11.982 --> 04:13.825
Did you clock that?

04:14.841 --> 04:16.125
He's just took it the wrong way.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.308
What?

04:17.298 --> 04:18.685
The threat to knock him out, Mum.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.858
He knows I'm joking.

04:19.858 --> 04:23.032
It's not you it's just,
your manner can be...

04:23.058 --> 04:25.137
Say what you mean, Karen.

04:25.127 --> 04:30.008
To a more delicate soul
you might sometimes come across
slightly aggressive.

04:29.997 --> 04:31.919
Me?! Aggressive?!

04:33.556 --> 04:36.332
Y'all right Jamie. Can I have
a lager and a blackhead, please?

04:36.324 --> 04:37.120
Still no Carl?

04:37.114 --> 04:38.843
Nah.

04:38.838 --> 04:39.862
Yes, mate?

04:38.838 --> 04:41.079
Two Stellas.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.088
Oh, what convenient timing!

04:44.087 --> 04:49.366
Stella, by name...
It's me youngest.

04:49.358 --> 04:53.556
Fucking...no offence, mate.
Just apple of me eye, that's all.

05:00.204 --> 05:01.614
Jimmy must have
something to do with it.

05:01.604 --> 05:03.549
Yeah, everyone knows he did it.

05:03.540 --> 05:06.759
No not Bonehead.
Carl and Chesney legging it.

05:06.757 --> 05:10.295
I heard that slag sister were
all over Chesney at party

05:10.290 --> 05:13.202
Yeah, was that before or
after Bonehead shagged her?

05:17.582 --> 05:23.157
I'm fucked, I need to get me head
down. Where you going? Here y'are.

05:30.783 --> 05:32.068
Fuck this.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.709
This'll wake you up!

05:49.724 --> 05:51.715
Whoa!

05:55.193 --> 05:56.729
GUN SHOT

05:56.727 --> 05:58.331
Ches!

06:03.203 --> 06:07.264
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

06:07.259 --> 06:08.669
That'll do.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.934
Look, please,
stop pointing the gun at me.

06:17.870 --> 06:21.579
Please. I'm sorry.

06:22.670 --> 06:23.625
Help him.

06:30.827 --> 06:31.885
CAR TYRES CRUNCH

06:36.535 --> 06:38.856
In there. Hurry up.

06:38.854 --> 06:40.833
Come on.

06:40.831 --> 06:42.549
What are you going to do with us?

06:40.831 --> 06:44.073
I said hurry up.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.288
Quick. Move it!

06:53.405 --> 06:54.861
Ah, that's hanging.

06:54.859 --> 06:56.383
It's all right.

06:58.757 --> 07:01.294
(SIGHS) Carl!

07:01.290 --> 07:02.348
His phone's off!

07:02.346 --> 07:04.758
Well, he wouldn't answer to
you anyway. What you did to him.

07:02.346 --> 07:06.715
We need to report it.

07:06.714 --> 07:07.419
They're grown men.

07:07.418 --> 07:10.103
When's Carl gone missing
for two hours before?

07:10.095 --> 07:12.086
When he got herpes round his mouth.

07:12.075 --> 07:12.973
He didn't.

07:12.970 --> 07:16.121
Plating that mong who did
handstands in the Jockey.

07:16.116 --> 07:18.789
He's got a point. If they
don't want to be contacted...

07:20.060 --> 07:22.085
I dread the day
I have to rely on you.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.002
Well, maybe you're
just missing him?

07:42.150 --> 07:43.742
What's she digging now?

07:43.736 --> 07:45.158
Don't think about it.

07:45.155 --> 07:47.032
What is she digging?!

07:55.064 --> 07:56.270
Help!

07:56.263 --> 07:59.585
You twisted fucker! Let us out!

07:59.584 --> 08:00.630
Anyone, please help!

08:00.625 --> 08:03.162
Shut up. Shut up.

08:03.154 --> 08:08.285
(SHE SINGS)

08:09.747 --> 08:12.398
Please! Just talk to us.

08:12.394 --> 08:13.656
What do you
want to talk to her for?!

08:12.394 --> 08:16.307
Ask her not to do anything stupid.

08:16.303 --> 08:21.354
More stupid than undress,
kidnap and let us starve to death?

08:23.247 --> 08:24.908
I'm too young to die.

08:24.906 --> 08:26.567
We're not going to die.

08:29.723 --> 08:31.361
SINGING STOPS

08:37.193 --> 08:38.125
Smell cooking?

08:40.169 --> 08:42.239
It might be other
runaways she's caught.

08:42.236 --> 08:43.828
Help!

08:43.818 --> 08:44.762
Help! Help!

08:43.818 --> 08:46.321
Help! Help!
Somebody help us! You sick bitch!

08:43.818 --> 08:48.994
Let us out!

DOOR CREAKS

08:52.223 --> 08:53.906
So sorry, lads.

08:53.904 --> 08:56.919
Smoking too much of my own shit
always makes me paranoid.

08:56.915 --> 08:58.496
Breakfast's ready.

09:01.908 --> 09:03.694
Put your hands together for Mavis,

09:03.687 --> 09:07.293
who's had her best collection yet
at Timperley Infirmary.

09:07.290 --> 09:11.056
Er, Â£62.28

09:14.382 --> 09:18.603
Oh, and, er, the calendar's
drawing ever closer, girls.

09:18.595 --> 09:20.472
(ALL) Ooh!

09:20.462 --> 09:23.044
We need at least three more,

09:23.041 --> 09:26.431
even though Edith has volunteered
to be on every month!

09:26.430 --> 09:27.636
(ALL) Ooh!

09:27.630 --> 09:29.086
(THEY CHANT) Out! Out!

09:29.080 --> 09:31.378
Out! Out! Out!

09:32.734 --> 09:35.168

09:36.994 --> 09:39.781
I think that's time
for a break, ladies.

09:46.441 --> 09:47.874
What do you think of the gang?

09:46.441 --> 09:49.330
All right, I suppose.

09:49.324 --> 09:55.058
It's all right. You'll settle. That's
just "first day of term" stuff.

09:55.057 --> 09:58.675
It took me over a month
before I finally settled.

09:58.665 --> 09:59.620

09:59.775 --> 10:00.810

10:00.800 --> 10:03.724

in her wheelchair.

10:03.721 --> 10:06.019
Give Stephen Hawkings a hard on.

10:06.010 --> 10:08.353
SHOCKED LAUGHTER

10:08.352 --> 10:09.467
And now look at me!

10:11.030 --> 10:13.362
I'd probably get me kit off
for a good cause.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.419
Especially if it'd help
with the gang.

10:15.419 --> 10:16.613
(Chatsworth.)

10:19.011 --> 10:21.935
Don't give them any more ammunition.

10:21.932 --> 10:25.106
You'll find them
an even harder bunch to crack.

10:25.105 --> 10:27.903
Er, shall we do coffee? Soon?

10:28.942 --> 10:30.660
I'll call you.

10:32.144 --> 10:34.590
(THEY CHUCKLE)

10:34.583 --> 10:35.993
(Drug addicts.)

10:38.751 --> 10:41.561
You two-faced skinny bitch.

10:41.559 --> 10:43.857
Bet you never had to bring kids up.

10:43.856 --> 10:45.300
Save it Lumley.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.896
Nobody tells me what to do.

10:47.894 --> 10:50.454
Don't fucking ignore me.

You OK?

11:12.354 --> 11:14.697
Women's Institute?!

11:14.698 --> 11:17.280
That is what all this is about?

11:17.269 --> 11:18.293
They're all right.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.151
They're not you.

11:20.142 --> 11:21.427
I know they're not.

11:21.418 --> 11:25.934
But the other night wasn't the only
time I've scared someone off.

11:25.934 --> 11:26.889
That is their problem.

11:27.115 --> 11:28.298
It's not though, Karen.

11:30.386 --> 11:33.139
I was born and brought up
on a council estate

11:33.135 --> 11:35.547
35 miles away from here,

11:35.540 --> 11:38.532
and I'm going to spend
the rest of me life on one.

11:38.529 --> 11:40.975
So, how are them stuck-up
boots going to help?

11:44.589 --> 11:46.602
Improve me jam-making?

11:53.209 --> 11:56.622
I'm now in this constant struggle
with my personality.

11:53.209 --> 11:59.079
You've been through a lot, girl.

11:59.077 --> 12:01.625
So don't you start
trying to be summat you're not.

12:05.686 --> 12:07.142
I promise.

12:12.871 --> 12:16.159
I'm sorry about your dog.

12:22.345 --> 12:24.711
More concerned with you two...

12:24.711 --> 12:27.054
now you know my little secret.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.274
Don't worry about us.

No chance of us saying owt.

12:32.508 --> 12:33.702
Or that you're capable of taxing me.

You're holding the gun.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.019
I unloaded it this morning.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.316
Make sure there's
no more accidents.

13:48.504 --> 13:51.359
What did the police want?

13:51.359 --> 13:54.920
Just reports of two lads
trying doors on cars and sheds.

13:54.912 --> 13:57.858
Wouldn't want to get
arrested round here.

13:57.849 --> 13:59.293
Have you seen The Wicker Man?

14:00.873 --> 14:02.238
Guess not.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.112
So...

14:05.110 --> 14:07.761
No belongings
and a fiver between you.

14:07.757 --> 14:09.668
Tells me you left somewhere
in a hurry.

14:10.789 --> 14:12.438
Yeah. You could say that.

14:12.432 --> 14:13.456
It's just...

14:13.455 --> 14:14.922
I'm not interested.

14:14.919 --> 14:17.604
No shit on my doorstep.

14:17.602 --> 14:19.536
Where were you headed?

14:19.533 --> 14:20.545
We was going to go...

14:20.535 --> 14:21.991
Ireland.

14:28.517 --> 14:30.394
I'll drop you at the ferry tonight.

14:30.384 --> 14:32.557
My way of saying sorry for
doing a Papa Fritzl.

14:34.329 --> 14:36.706
There's a spare bed
if you want to get some sleep.

14:41.779 --> 14:43.064
How much is there?

14:47.360 --> 14:50.625
Well, we're here today to kick-start
a brand new initiative

14:50.618 --> 14:54.657
that aims to allow residents of
the community a voice of their own.

14:54.656 --> 14:55.907
DOG BARKS

14:55.901 --> 14:56.913
Hey!

14:56.902 --> 14:58.221
Aargh!

14:59.554 --> 15:01.328
Tell us how this all came about.

15:01.325 --> 15:03.259
Not bad, that.

15:03.256 --> 15:05.144
Better than some.

15:05.139 --> 15:07.687
Graffiti scares the punters, though.

15:09.639 --> 15:10.401
Seen our Shane?

15:10.390 --> 15:11.482
He's just gone badger baiting.
Seen our Shane?

15:11.472 --> 15:13.076
In the daytime?

15:13.071 --> 15:18.657
He needs to earn for his honeymoon.
But he's took Bunty's dog without
permission, and it's epileptic.

15:18.655 --> 15:21.067
Mind, some farmers are happy
to see a few less.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.215
I recognise Billy Smart in the suit,

15:27.209 --> 15:29.894
even without the oranges
and a stiletto up his arse.

15:34.181 --> 15:35.136
Hello.

15:37.822 --> 15:39.278
What you filming me for?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.638
You look like a likely candidate.

15:42.719 --> 15:44.163
Freeze! RSPCA!

15:44.156 --> 15:46.329
Ha, ha, ha. Bang to rights.

15:46.325 --> 15:49.670
I've got the farmer's permission,
you dickhead.

15:49.665 --> 15:51.735
Here. Put me down for one.

15:53.023 --> 15:54.991
Pretending to be a grass
is never a joke.

15:54.990 --> 15:56.639
Ah!

15:57.816 --> 15:58.987
It's a movie camera. Digital.

15:57.816 --> 16:01.525
Did Baghead Billy ram-raid
Currys again?

16:01.522 --> 16:04.173
Me and Liam got picked off the
council cos Chatsworth's a shithole.

16:04.167 --> 16:05.623
What for?

16:05.616 --> 16:08.153
"Community initiative to aid
our recovery."

16:08.148 --> 16:12.118
We make films of our situation, yeah,
and see what we look like.

16:12.112 --> 16:14.706
Then it's easier to fix.
It's what the Yanks do.

16:14.698 --> 16:17.349
Oh, my giddy fucking God.
You are a grass.

16:17.348 --> 16:18.189
Why's that being a grass?

16:18.185 --> 16:19.629
Why's it not?

16:19.628 --> 16:23.394
The best one gets a grand
and a free trip to Hollinwood.

16:23.384 --> 16:25.807
But we can split the money.

16:25.805 --> 16:29.172
Nah. Two weeks' badger baiting
earns more than that.

16:29.171 --> 16:32.948
So? What, killing god's creatures
and stinking out the gaff?

16:32.942 --> 16:34.386
I know what I'd rather do.

16:34.380 --> 16:35.916
What is it with you and films?

16:35.910 --> 16:39.505
It's good to dream. It don't have to
be interviews. We can dramatise it.

16:39.495 --> 16:41.087
What, like Corrie?

16:41.082 --> 16:42.504
No. Drama!

16:42.495 --> 16:44.019
Anything. You know.

16:44.013 --> 16:46.629
"Nobody leaves the baby
in the corner."

16:46.627 --> 16:47.924
I've got evidence.

16:49.788 --> 16:51.665
I'll be watching you.

16:52.584 --> 16:55.838
Here. Don't say owt
in front of Donnie Brasco, but...

16:55.835 --> 16:57.951
we have got a camera of our own,
you know.

16:57.943 --> 17:01.379
Next filming I do is from a hot-air
balloon over the Serengeti.

17:08.092 --> 17:11.107
It's a great way
of holding the mirror to ourselves.

17:11.106 --> 17:14.030
Amazing stories without the cost
of scripted drama.

17:14.027 --> 17:17.484
We'll interview you about your
experience with the local community.

17:17.482 --> 17:20.541
Kyle! Jeremy! Put the fucking
lotion in the fucking basket.

17:21.848 --> 17:23.896
Carl and Chesney are wanted!

17:23.895 --> 17:25.169
For what?

17:25.164 --> 17:26.926
Murder. No way!

17:26.924 --> 17:29.688
We were just reporting 'em missing
at the police station

17:29.680 --> 17:30.704
and that slag sister was coming out.

17:30.697 --> 17:31.777
Who?

17:31.769 --> 17:32.906
Jimmy's sister stuck 'em in.

17:32.904 --> 17:33.871
Lying bitch.

17:32.904 --> 17:35.361
Slow down. What happened?

17:35.361 --> 17:37.556
Sammi. She's give a statement.

17:37.554 --> 17:39.636
She saw 'em with Bonehead
five minutes before he was killed.

17:37.554 --> 17:42.105
The police must know it was Jimmy.

17:42.099 --> 17:43.839
That means nothing.
We've got to get 'em home.

17:43.836 --> 17:45.280
Or keep 'em away.

17:48.239 --> 17:51.117
Sometimes, I'd swear
they're not even mine.

17:56.185 --> 17:57.629
Oo-er, Mrs!

17:57.623 --> 18:00.945
Local MP with a Marilyn fixation.

18:00.943 --> 18:03.275
Oh, yeah.

18:03.274 --> 18:05.242
(IN CHARACTER) Yes, Mr President.

18:05.233 --> 18:08.122
Happy birthday, Mr President.

18:08.122 --> 18:12.821
Orange and a high-heel shoe
up your anus, Mr President.

18:12.817 --> 18:14.091
(CHUCKLES)

18:14.089 --> 18:16.080
Come here, you daft get.

18:17.334 --> 18:19.461
Know this, Kelly Maguire.

18:19.452 --> 18:21.807
I don't, nor never will...

18:22.825 --> 18:24.144
..need oranges,

18:24.143 --> 18:27.283
poppers, pills or Viagra.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.227
Just you.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.872
In the gear...or starkers.

18:31.867 --> 18:34.188
(GIGGLES)

18:36.207 --> 18:37.651
Mm-mmm.

18:37.642 --> 18:38.768
Pumpkin...

18:38.760 --> 18:40.204
Yes, honey bunny?

18:40.196 --> 18:41.823
You know Micky's camera thingy?

18:41.811 --> 18:42.891
Mm.

18:42.883 --> 18:45.238
Well, I do role playing at work
all the time,

18:45.234 --> 18:49.421
and I think, maybe...I've always
wanted to be an actress.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.955
I like the sound of that, an' all.

18:52.455 --> 18:54.673
No piss, pain
or back bottom, though.

19:01.228 --> 19:02.889
(MICKY) Cut! Got it.

19:02.889 --> 19:05.983
Liam. Chop, chop. Nosing at our film.

19:05.983 --> 19:07.018
What's this supposed to be?

19:05.983 --> 19:07.848
What's this supposed to be?
Tell 'em nothing!

19:07.844 --> 19:09.641
We're calling it Fit Bird.

19:09.635 --> 19:13.150
Why aren't you making a film that
says something about our situation?

19:14.982 --> 19:16.631
Said we should've done Top Gun!

19:16.629 --> 19:17.857
Stupid!

19:17.855 --> 19:21.404
Fit Bird is going to show
the plight of working girls.

19:21.397 --> 19:23.183
Help get 'em off the street.

19:23.179 --> 19:25.977
Sugar-coated fluff. You can show
that but you can also make a stand.

19:25.978 --> 19:27.115
What, like you are?!

19:27.114 --> 19:29.014
It's verite, you twat.

19:29.011 --> 19:32.606
The art of letting the estate
speak for itself.

19:32.599 --> 19:35.591
People would rather watch a film
than a documentary any day.

19:35.583 --> 19:37.790
Michael Moore might have
something to say about that.

19:35.583 --> 19:40.395
Who? That arsonist kid in your year?

19:40.386 --> 19:42.206
Why are they working with him?

19:42.207 --> 19:43.185
Go, Liam. Go.

19:48.223 --> 19:50.464
(HUMS A TUNE)

19:52.259 --> 19:54.784
Oh, it's got to be worth a shot.

19:54.783 --> 19:56.728
What's the point?
Don't we want to get away from here?

19:56.727 --> 19:58.388
Why don't you just ask her?

19:58.386 --> 20:00.399
You ask her. It's your idea.

20:00.399 --> 20:01.423
All right. I will.

20:08.179 --> 20:09.532
More salad?

20:09.524 --> 20:11.446
He's on a diet.

20:17.647 --> 20:18.796
I thought they were supposed
to be fat.

20:17.647 --> 20:20.389
When you sell 'em for meat.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.678
I want this lazy fucker to mate.

20:22.673 --> 20:24.322
He's too heavy to get off
the ground to mount anything.

20:24.312 --> 20:25.916
Can't girl pigs get on top?

20:28.710 --> 20:30.200
What's it called?

20:30.189 --> 20:32.669
He. Harris.

20:32.662 --> 20:35.074
Don't want to leave yet.
It's too early.

20:35.073 --> 20:36.017
Hazel.

20:37.131 --> 20:39.008
We've been thinking...

20:40.280 --> 20:41.212
Your weed...

20:41.211 --> 20:43.247
Forget it.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.813
Oh, come on. There's always
a drought round our way.

20:45.813 --> 20:47.929
There's a drought everywhere
these days.

20:47.919 --> 20:49.955
I bet we can beat what price
you get now.

20:49.946 --> 20:51.004
And pay with what?

20:51.001 --> 20:52.127
Yeah, we know people.

20:52.122 --> 20:53.157
It's all right.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.858
Come on. Just a little bit. Hazel.

20:54.859 --> 20:56.815
It's mainly personal anyway.

20:56.808 --> 20:57.866
All that?

20:57.863 --> 20:59.831
There's other users in the valley,

20:59.823 --> 21:02.451
and a couple of Scousers
take the rest.

21:02.442 --> 21:04.216
Probably are a bit cheap, though.

21:04.210 --> 21:05.177
We won't be.

21:06.810 --> 21:08.107
Go on, Hazel.

21:08.103 --> 21:10.901
Just give us a sample.
We'll prove we're worth it.

21:10.901 --> 21:12.550
If it's good, we'll get paid in
advance.

21:10.901 --> 21:13.335
It's good.

21:10.901 --> 21:15.008
Five days into blossom.

21:14.997 --> 21:17.761
Go double with this. The buds stink
but it won't burn 'em.

21:17.758 --> 21:19.339
Makes them stickier.

21:19.338 --> 21:20.828
What about Ireland?

21:20.823 --> 21:23.724
Second thoughts.
Make some money, we can go anywhere.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.296
Crop's not ready. Two days?

21:25.291 --> 21:27.782
Four. I'd say less. But we can wait.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.748
(CHUCKLES) Can you, now?

21:29.741 --> 21:31.060
If you're interested.

21:31.051 --> 21:32.541
Where will you stay?

21:32.534 --> 21:34.434
Is there a hotel?

21:34.433 --> 21:35.343
Won't that let people know
where you are?

21:35.335 --> 21:36.393
So?

21:36.392 --> 21:37.984
You can't be proper fugitives, then.

21:36.392 --> 21:40.044
We never said we were.

21:40.035 --> 21:42.913
Come on. There must be
lots of jobs on a farm.

21:42.903 --> 21:45.087
Just while we wait.

21:50.458 --> 21:51.823
You lookin' at me?

21:51.813 --> 21:53.462
Yeah, you.

21:55.353 --> 21:57.048
You lookin' at me?

21:57.045 --> 21:58.114
Because...

21:58.109 --> 22:01.203
I can't see anyone else here.

22:01.193 --> 22:04.162
Who the fuck do you think
you're looking at?

22:04.163 --> 22:06.609
Rated. You look like a bell end.

22:06.603 --> 22:08.184
Oh, well. Life imitating art.

22:08.183 --> 22:10.538
Your script better be as good
as your porn was.

22:10.535 --> 22:14.505
You don't have to dress as one
to play Sonic the Hedgehog!

22:14.502 --> 22:15.594
I'm writing a script.

22:17.902 --> 22:18.789
What?

22:18.785 --> 22:20.366
Carl and Ches.

22:21.444 --> 22:23.730
They've pinned Bonehead's murder
on them.

22:27.314 --> 22:29.157
Someone needs to sort Jimmy out.

22:29.152 --> 22:30.881
No! You're Maguires.

22:30.874 --> 22:32.057
Come on. Do the right thing.

22:32.055 --> 22:34.660
Round the family up.
Force Jimmy to confess.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.409
I can't. Why?

22:36.406 --> 22:37.919
Cos it's not our fight.

22:39.196 --> 22:40.948
That's never stopped you before.

22:44.759 --> 22:47.159
I can't concentrate in here.

22:50.055 --> 22:51.113
Do it for me.

22:51.111 --> 22:54.194
I would. I've already asked me dad.

22:54.187 --> 22:56.678
He said he's not risking any of us
for any of yous.

22:56.677 --> 22:59.453
Plus, he can't stand
the fucking sight of that Chesney

22:59.451 --> 23:01.362
after his mam ripped him off.

23:03.475 --> 23:04.442
Look, I'm sorry.

23:18.077 --> 23:20.193
(MIMI, POSH) Is it full frontal?

23:20.183 --> 23:22.026
We will be nude.

23:22.019 --> 23:24.567
But with fruit and flowers,

23:24.559 --> 23:28.051
tastefully placed
to protect our modesty.

23:28.050 --> 23:32.157
My Paddy loved me
in nothing but a Santy hat.

23:32.151 --> 23:35.063
I don't think it's your thing.

23:35.058 --> 23:39.779
Laura Ashley,
under a good old M&S cardie.

23:39.770 --> 23:42.921
Make a good leprechaun in March?

23:42.921 --> 23:46.425
Maybe not the modelling, Mimi.

23:48.618 --> 23:50.882
Any other favourite labels?

23:52.464 --> 23:54.500
Bit of Lacoste, back in the day.

23:54.494 --> 23:56.428
"Dey do, dough, don't dey, dough?"

23:56.428 --> 24:02.162
My ultimate fashion disaster
was on Lady Captain's Day last year.

24:02.152 --> 24:04.063
The heavens opened,

24:04.052 --> 24:07.328
and my bra strap was showing
through my cashmere Pringle.

24:07.322 --> 24:08.493
ALARM WAILS

24:07.322 --> 24:10.906
Not so fast, Little Miss Bootle.

24:10.896 --> 24:12.705
Get off me!

24:13.942 --> 24:15.330
All right. Get off!

24:15.319 --> 24:16.638
Shut it!

24:16.630 --> 24:17.801
(Bitch!)

24:25.242 --> 24:26.425
You think sheep bite?

24:26.422 --> 24:27.855
Probably.

24:38.572 --> 24:40.073
It's good here, man.

24:40.073 --> 24:41.256
It's not that good.

24:41.254 --> 24:43.984
There's fuck all for me back there.

24:43.976 --> 24:45.876
I know there is for you.

24:48.266 --> 24:50.905
Should have just fronted
the little dickhead.

24:50.899 --> 24:52.116
Think so?

24:53.901 --> 24:56.426
Nah. He'd leather me all over.

24:56.421 --> 24:58.082
And still hurt Liam.

25:02.198 --> 25:04.905
I didn't think I'd miss home.

25:04.896 --> 25:07.865
You'll get over it.
He wouldn't get us in Pakistan.

25:07.862 --> 25:09.659
Behave!

25:09.651 --> 25:11.676
I know. London?

25:11.675 --> 25:13.597
There's too many homeless.

25:13.590 --> 25:15.273
John Macca's brother
was on the gear in a week.

25:15.266 --> 25:16.733
He was a baghead before!

25:16.726 --> 25:18.011
Wasn't queer, though.

25:19.191 --> 25:22.024
At least we're staying put
till the weed's ready.

25:27.473 --> 25:28.394
Carl?

25:31.847 --> 25:33.132
You all right?

25:33.125 --> 25:34.865
Thought you might be hungry.

25:34.861 --> 25:37.193
Nice kid, in't he?
Let's hope he makes it to 12.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.302
Anything good?

25:50.297 --> 25:52.743
Small matter of a firearm.

25:52.735 --> 25:55.215
Just got him another five years.

25:55.209 --> 25:57.325
Let's get it and get out of here.

25:57.314 --> 25:59.748
And action.

25:59.744 --> 26:02.486
Chatsworth was developed
as a garden suburb

26:02.485 --> 26:06.319
in the post-war years,
a time of optimism in city planning.

26:06.316 --> 26:10.104
The good intentions faded with time
and the shift in cultural attitudes.

26:11.891 --> 26:13.643
Good take?

26:13.639 --> 26:15.175
Perfect.

26:18.841 --> 26:20.945
# ..and the seven seas

26:20.936 --> 26:25.088
# Everybody's looking for something

26:25.081 --> 26:28.517
# Some of them want to use you

26:29.787 --> 26:33.188
# Some of them want
to get used by you... #

26:34.980 --> 26:36.538
Stop doing that!

26:36.537 --> 26:37.686
Go on, Hazel.

26:38.890 --> 26:43.054
Hardly the Palladium, but I held
a note longer than most.

26:43.049 --> 26:44.516
Scran time soon?

26:44.516 --> 26:46.666
This'll build your appetite.

26:48.761 --> 26:51.116
Hmmm! Haven't you got small hands?

26:51.107 --> 26:52.495
Don't believe the hype.

26:53.803 --> 26:55.566
I'd love to work on cruise ships.

26:55.558 --> 26:56.809
You still wear armbands!

26:56.801 --> 26:58.598
Why did you stop?

26:58.592 --> 27:01.652
It's harder for mature singers
when they leave the ships.
Look at Jane Macdonald.

27:01.643 --> 27:03.497
Look at Jane Macdonald.
So why leave?

27:03.493 --> 27:04.721
Indeed.

27:04.718 --> 27:05.332
Which one's your ex?

27:04.718 --> 27:06.379
At the back.

27:06.369 --> 27:09.953
You'd be all right,
the size of his hands.

27:09.948 --> 27:11.233
They were the problem.

27:11.222 --> 27:11.995
In what way?

27:11.222 --> 27:13.452
'..teenager Ted Boden...'

27:13.449 --> 27:14.450
There's your dad!

27:15.506 --> 27:20.876
'..had attended a house party
after which he was brutally
attacked and later died.

27:20.874 --> 27:24.560
'The police have released
the images of suspects,

27:24.554 --> 27:27.864
'Carl Gallagher and Chesney Karib.

27:27.856 --> 27:32.452
'A witness statement claims
to have seen both men with the
victim shortly before his death.'

27:43.591 --> 27:45.127
I wanted to kill a man once.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.670
We didn't kill him!

27:47.661 --> 27:48.810
Looks that way.

27:48.802 --> 27:50.440
Ches, we need to get back.

27:50.437 --> 27:54.032
They've got fuck all evidence,
we've just got to tell the truth.

27:54.026 --> 27:55.527
And Jimmy'll come for us.

27:55.527 --> 27:56.596
Not if he's in jail.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.559
Brothers, uncles,
rest of his firm.

27:58.557 --> 28:00.206
We're on the run for murder.

28:00.202 --> 28:01.669
In for a penny!

28:01.669 --> 28:03.068
We're fucked either way.

28:03.057 --> 28:07.050
Remanded for killing Bonehead or
getting done in by wannabe gangsters.

28:07.047 --> 28:07.957
We'll get police protection.

28:07.949 --> 28:09.234
Yeah(!)

28:09.224 --> 28:13.354
Coz they're known for sympathy
when a brother's got problems.

28:13.348 --> 28:16.363
What protection? You're suspects!

28:16.352 --> 28:18.320
We need to get back and sort this.

28:18.315 --> 28:21.227
Will that lessen the threat
to your little brother?

28:26.070 --> 28:28.118
Contrary to
the trend of pub closures,

28:28.111 --> 28:29.954
and regardless of any recession,

28:29.947 --> 28:33.906
Chatsworth regulars still
find ways to attend their local pub.

28:51.615 --> 28:55.278
Scouse decoy service suspended.
You're not welcome.

28:55.272 --> 28:56.466
At least you're still speaking.

28:56.462 --> 28:57.747
You reckon?

28:57.737 --> 28:59.045
They can't have kept
you five minutes!

28:57.737 --> 29:00.865
Not the point.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.756
I'm not proud of myself.

29:10.748 --> 29:12.272
Save it, Winona.

29:12.263 --> 29:15.630
It's just that nothing beats
that adrenalin rush.

29:15.629 --> 29:18.302
Normal people stop
around their 15th birthday.

29:18.297 --> 29:19.912
I didn't start till I was 50.

29:19.909 --> 29:21.103
Well, you need help.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.037
I'm getting it.

29:23.822 --> 29:25.153
I am sorry.

29:25.144 --> 29:28.580
I promise I won't
put you through that again.

29:28.573 --> 29:30.029
Fair enough.

29:30.027 --> 29:34.134
As well as the apology,
I came to talk about the calendar.

29:34.127 --> 29:36.300
My new white basque and the pom-poms?

29:36.297 --> 29:38.026
I'm a lovely snowman.

29:38.021 --> 29:42.321
I was wondering about getting
something to help the mood?

29:42.312 --> 29:46.703
You know, relax and
open the girls up a bit?

29:46.702 --> 29:50.809
A couple of them are really
quite shy. You know.

29:50.802 --> 29:54.112
Oh. And I can get
that sort of stuff?

29:54.104 --> 29:55.287
Can't you?

29:55.286 --> 29:57.299
I'll sort something out.

29:58.133 --> 30:00.875
Not that different
to the rest of us after all!

30:00.870 --> 30:04.727
Actually worse,
but pretending to be better?

30:04.716 --> 30:06.013
Hypocrites!

30:06.009 --> 30:09.274
It's OK. Wait and see. Sshhh.

30:14.115 --> 30:18.028
Leave it. Don't. No!

30:18.024 --> 30:20.470
You think you're a big man?

30:20.466 --> 30:23.469
Do the crime
but you can't do the time?

30:23.466 --> 30:24.478
Is that right?

30:24.467 --> 30:25.582
What's going on?

30:25.572 --> 30:29.076
And what's with the bullshit
statements, you lying slag?

30:29.073 --> 30:30.005
Hey. That's not nice.

30:30.003 --> 30:31.277
Stupid bitch!

30:31.271 --> 30:33.171
You think everyone's scared?

30:34.445 --> 30:35.628
You make me sick.

30:35.621 --> 30:36.565
Fuckin'...

30:42.309 --> 30:43.253
Get off.

30:44.302 --> 30:45.314
Out!

30:52.293 --> 30:55.148
SMOOTH JAZZ MUSIC

30:55.143 --> 30:58.579
The war on terror
fucked me up big-time.

30:58.573 --> 31:02.555
Back home, the war on crime
raged all around.

31:02.547 --> 31:05.516
And the good guys were losing.

31:09.439 --> 31:11.327
CUT!

31:11.323 --> 31:12.073
Bramhall, please.

31:11.323 --> 31:13.268
Whoa, lady.

31:13.258 --> 31:16.386
I think you'll find I saw him first!

31:16.384 --> 31:18.397
We're making a film, love.

31:18.397 --> 31:20.149
Aren't we all.

31:20.147 --> 31:22.490
OK, let's go again, everyone.
From the top.

31:23.657 --> 31:25.477
My fucking arm's killing me!

31:28.299 --> 31:30.142
I still say it needs a stitch.

31:30.135 --> 31:35.107
Yeah, five-hour wait with overdosing
smack-heads for a scratch?

31:35.098 --> 31:37.453
No chance.

31:37.444 --> 31:38.832
Sorry.

31:38.824 --> 31:40.143
Don't worry about it.

31:40.142 --> 31:41.678
About everything.

31:41.677 --> 31:44.123
Now I'm feeling even more guilty.

31:44.114 --> 31:46.389
Don't use this to put
another downer on us.

31:46.386 --> 31:50.550
If Carl was still with you,
he wouldn't be fucking about
at parties.

31:50.545 --> 31:54.208
He wouldn't be in this sort of shit
and you wouldn't be getting whacked.

31:54.200 --> 31:58.443
And if wasn't with you,
I could be at parties, off me head

31:58.434 --> 32:02.700
and risk getting raped or killed
by knobheads.

32:02.690 --> 32:04.681
What sort of way is
that to look at life?

32:08.078 --> 32:11.138
Here. You need it.

32:14.991 --> 32:18.324
Now that will get a party going.

32:18.314 --> 32:19.963
Not enough.

32:19.958 --> 32:22.301
You'll incite an orgy.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.143
Exactly!

32:24.136 --> 32:24.773
Garcon!

32:24.136 --> 32:26.570
Mam, we need a Scouser.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.585
What the fuck do you look like?

32:30.575 --> 32:32.258
Has anyone seen Liam?

32:38.480 --> 32:42.621
Fucking gangsters, eh?
Eh, you remember, Lillian!

32:42.613 --> 32:44.376
You know, before Slack Alices,

32:44.369 --> 32:46.746
me and our Bernard sent the Krays
packing.

32:46.746 --> 32:48.782
You'd have been about eight!

32:48.773 --> 32:53.255
Platform seven, Piccadilly station,
stood at the back, QSG.

32:53.252 --> 32:55.527
Showed the "Cockneys", all right.

32:55.523 --> 32:57.013
The shopping channel?

32:57.007 --> 33:00.192
Not QS - Quality Street Gang,

33:00.182 --> 33:04.198
you know, Tommy the Hat, Benny Axes,
Kenny the Dope. You know.

33:04.193 --> 33:06.536
Manchester's finest.

33:06.532 --> 33:08.181
I prefer Roses.

33:15.933 --> 33:18.845
# Raindrops keep falling on my head

33:19.905 --> 33:22.533
# But that doesn't mean my eyes
will soon... #

33:22.523 --> 33:24.536
You're like ET.

33:24.534 --> 33:27.765
# ..Crying's not for me

33:27.757 --> 33:30.965
# Cos I'm never going
to stop the rain... #

33:30.964 --> 33:33.683
No, not round here.
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

33:33.677 --> 33:35.213
What's wrong?

33:35.209 --> 33:37.086
Just not here.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.759
Come on, mate. Enjoy it while we can.

33:47.757 --> 33:48.781
I'm trying.

33:49.813 --> 33:52.873
She was a bit lively
getting you away from there.

33:54.022 --> 33:55.796
Sacred spaces.

33:55.793 --> 33:57.932
She's right into me, though.

33:57.931 --> 33:59.512
She could be your mam!

34:01.168 --> 34:04.319
MILF with her own weed farm -
could it get any better?

34:06.379 --> 34:08.244
See you later.

34:08.239 --> 34:12.051
So you've had no boyfriends at all
since your ex?

34:12.049 --> 34:12.889
How long's he been dead?

34:12.049 --> 34:15.382
Couple of years.

34:15.373 --> 34:17.443
That's a long time without a man.

34:17.433 --> 34:18.775
Maybe.

34:18.772 --> 34:19.978
You don't talk about him much.

34:18.772 --> 34:21.217
That's right.

34:21.215 --> 34:24.661
But you started to.

34:24.650 --> 34:26.766
Penile cancer sounds nasty.

34:26.766 --> 34:28.279
Change the channel.

34:28.268 --> 34:30.203
Just change the channel.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.338
It's not contagious, is it?

34:32.335 --> 34:33.632
Just kept going on and on.

34:48.547 --> 34:50.721
You're right.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.484
It's been too long.

34:58.809 --> 35:00.071
I think she's up for it.

35:00.068 --> 35:01.638
Never(!)

35:01.634 --> 35:03.010
What's up with you?

35:03.005 --> 35:05.405
Let's see where your
dick takes us this time.

35:05.401 --> 35:07.665
Don't be like that.
She might want both of us.

35:11.675 --> 35:12.915
Give her one from me.

35:27.824 --> 35:29.519
Oh, no more!

35:37.446 --> 35:39.892
FUCK!

35:39.883 --> 35:44.035
PHONE RINGS

35:53.510 --> 35:56.582
'Carl, you always say "see you".'

36:09.865 --> 36:14.052
You'll be perfect for the part.
It's been a nightmare getting extras.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.309
Do we share the prize money?

36:15.300 --> 36:17.882
Why? You're pulling out anyway.

36:17.877 --> 36:20.311
We sacrifice our project
for a greater cause.

36:20.301 --> 36:21.768
You're not doing
anything about Jimmy.

36:21.766 --> 36:24.451
Seems everyone is
too scared to do anything.

36:24.448 --> 36:25.631
It's not our fight.

36:25.622 --> 36:29.945
You know, the surveillance
can look after itself.

36:32.237 --> 36:35.400
All right.
We'll split the winnings.

36:35.396 --> 36:36.681
OK.

36:44.611 --> 36:50.345
For some reason, my new bird
didn't understand me.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.756
I love the start of this.

36:56.030 --> 36:58.271
Are you right in the head?

36:58.263 --> 37:00.538
Lots of couples watch these films.

37:00.531 --> 37:01.975
On a first date?

37:05.635 --> 37:07.808
And...cut

37:07.808 --> 37:10.094
Great. Well done, team.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.572
All across the estate...

37:17.125 --> 37:19.411
Why won't the council sort it?

37:19.407 --> 37:23.275
Smackheads, crackheads,
rapists, murderers...

37:23.274 --> 37:25.083
Does me in.

37:25.072 --> 37:27.097
Looking for a good time?

37:27.086 --> 37:29.486
Cabbages me napper...

37:29.482 --> 37:31.347
Sends me under.

37:37.518 --> 37:40.919
Then I sussedit.

37:40.913 --> 37:45.100
Even though my swede kept pounding...

37:45.098 --> 37:46.872
Save just one little lamb...

37:46.870 --> 37:51.443
Save one...and the buzzing might
stop and the headaches go away.

37:55.725 --> 37:59.229
Damp pissflaps for the first time
in years girls.

37:59.220 --> 38:02.030
Right! Come on.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.485
Oh, come on, give it here.

38:41.188 --> 38:43.190
Not so posh now, are you, girls?

38:48.676 --> 38:49.984
Can you hear me now?

38:54.688 --> 38:56.053
Can you hear me now?

38:56.045 --> 38:57.251
Ian?

39:00.719 --> 39:01.879
Yeah?

39:03.018 --> 39:05.304
I fancy a drink.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.027
Have you got a death wish?

39:05.299 --> 39:07.574
He won't stop me.

39:07.566 --> 39:09.488
You don't think?

39:09.480 --> 39:11.300
Are you going somewhere?

39:11.299 --> 39:13.267
Yeah I got something to do.

39:14.602 --> 39:15.682
What's this?

39:15.673 --> 39:18.551
Oh-ho! Now who's got a death wish?

39:18.544 --> 39:20.444
Have you got any better ideas?

39:20.444 --> 39:24.960
It's not Micky's movie!
Somebody might come forward.

39:24.956 --> 39:26.992
The whole estate's shit-scared.

39:26.985 --> 39:28.589
He's not gonna just admit to it.

39:28.581 --> 39:30.401
So I'll, I'll have to be subtle.

39:30.401 --> 39:33.290
Ian, it's not the time
to play the hero.

39:33.282 --> 39:34.567
I'm no hero.

39:34.566 --> 39:36.500
I steal my brother's girl

39:36.496 --> 39:38.430
then stand and watch her
get hit with a pool cue.

39:38.426 --> 39:39.563
Stop!

39:41.570 --> 39:44.221
I don't know how anyone
could hit a woman.

39:44.220 --> 39:46.984
You'd be surprised.

39:46.979 --> 39:48.264
Why d'you get with him?

39:48.256 --> 39:49.985
He didn't start out like that.

39:49.975 --> 39:52.205
I guess we both changed.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.168
Still no excuse.

39:58.071 --> 40:00.596
He broke six of my ribs once.

40:00.589 --> 40:03.183
Scum.

40:03.176 --> 40:05.724
You're sweet now, though.

40:05.722 --> 40:07.895
I wish my life was this sorted.

40:07.886 --> 40:09.126
D'you reckon?

40:09.116 --> 40:11.038
What more could you want?

40:11.028 --> 40:14.316
I wouldn't be so sure
I'm that good a role model.

40:18.632 --> 40:21.453
(SOBS)

40:21.447 --> 40:23.005
He can't stop you any more.

40:23.002 --> 40:26.563
You could just go back on the boats.

40:26.554 --> 40:27.578
He can.

40:27.576 --> 40:28.861
How?

40:34.596 --> 40:37.474
Oh, shit!

40:40.368 --> 40:41.596
Fuckin' kill you!

40:43.126 --> 40:44.662
Please!

41:00.928 --> 41:03.146
I'm more a prisoner than before.

41:04.757 --> 41:07.612
If I ever leave,
then they find the body.

41:09.303 --> 41:12.591
What do you think's left
down there after two years?

41:12.588 --> 41:15.648
Bet his hands are still as big.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.550
Pigs eat anything, don't they?

41:21.830 --> 41:23.718
No way, Chesney.

41:26.697 --> 41:29.268
Harris'd love a break
from that diet.

41:31.725 --> 41:34.057
All right, mate.

41:34.053 --> 41:35.111
You having a laugh?

41:35.105 --> 41:36.174
Are you?

41:36.174 --> 41:38.460
What is it with you and my family?

41:38.457 --> 41:42.006
You must mean Carl, cos
I ain't got round to Liam yet.

41:42.002 --> 41:43.424
Where is he?

41:43.413 --> 41:48.487
You think I'm stupid? I found
a camera. You do think I'm stupid.

42:03.399 --> 42:04.673
I'm getting out of here.

42:07.277 --> 42:08.198
When?

42:08.191 --> 42:10.011
Now.

42:10.006 --> 42:11.394
Right.

42:13.428 --> 42:15.896
I'm coming with you.

42:15.894 --> 42:17.202
What about the weed?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.465
Your new bird?

43:18.636 --> 43:21.446
SCREAMS

43:34.849 --> 43:37.135
Great ambition.
They should be really proud.

as the original, considering
the budget.

45:51.605 --> 45:54.392
It's a terrible affliction.
We put our heads together

45:54.382 --> 45:56.441
and come up with a solution.

45:56.439 --> 45:59.761
You won't know which is which.
Think Kelly'll be up for it?

45:59.760 --> 46:01.876
We all know
who's really responsible.

I'll fucking kill ya.

46:05.152 --> 46:07.279
Things can go back
to the way they were.

46:07.274 --> 46:08.559
No. They can't.

46:08.550 --> 46:09.847
Yeah, they can.

46:09.842 --> 46:11.286
Are you sure you want to do this?

46:11.280 --> 46:13.931

You know that bit of money you've
put aside? Not doing much, is it?

49:57.727 --> 50:00.161
No. But with a tax-free ISA
from Barclays,

50:00.355 --> 50:02.391
it can perform better
than you thought.

50:02.546 --> 50:06.016
# The sun'll come out tomorrow

50:06.144 --> 50:08.738
# Bet your bottom dollar that...

50:08.885 --> 50:10.125
Oh, there you are, you see.

50:10.270 --> 50:11.555
"Perform better than you thought."

50:11.546 --> 50:14.060
I wondered where this one was going.

50:14.198 --> 50:15.847
# Tomorrow!

50:15.988 --> 50:17.558
# Tomorrow!

50:17.548 --> 50:20.039
# You're always a day away!

small step

50:21.515 --> 50:23.187
and open a tax-free
ISA from:

At British Gas, we know
it hasn't been easy this winter.

50:30.014 --> 50:33.142
That's why we're dropping
our gas prices again.

50:33.318 --> 50:35.206
So now we have the cheapest

50:35.330 --> 50:38.504
standard gas and electricity tariff

50:38.633 --> 50:40.419
of any major supplier in Britain.

51:41.546 --> 51:44.253
# Welcome to my world

51:46.883 --> 51:48.680
# Built with you in mind

51:48.829 --> 51:51.616
New Sensatori holidays from Thomson.

51:51.754 --> 51:53.187
Built with you in mind.

53:34.157 --> 53:37.308
This programme contains
strong language and violence.

53:37.303 --> 53:40.261
Emily! This is my...friend, Lara.

53:40.252 --> 53:41.810
This is my friend, Mandy.

53:41.805 --> 53:42.908
Have you already met?

53:42.908 --> 53:44.694
Yeah. It was a coincidence.

53:44.689 --> 53:45.747
'What's going on?'

53:45.738 --> 53:47.308
Nothing.

53:47.306 --> 53:49.604
James, aren't you supposed
to be in jail?

53:49.599 --> 53:50.839
Yes.

53:50.832 --> 53:52.436
You can't just stay here!

53:52.431 --> 53:54.456
Effie, what the fuck is going on?

53:54.455 --> 53:55.626
You didn't reply.

53:59.226 --> 54:01.979
Freddie! Effie won't
come out of the toilet.

54:01.970 --> 54:02.880
You left her alone?

54:06.470 --> 54:11.294
She's going to need us
to help rebuild her again.

54:47.552 --> 54:50.419
MAN: What are you thinking about?

54:50.418 --> 54:51.840
My brother.

54:54.934 --> 54:57.539
What about him?

54:57.534 --> 55:00.332
Nothing.

55:00.326 --> 55:02.248
Something happened to him,
didn't it?

55:04.778 --> 55:06.871
Lots of things happened to him.

55:06.869 --> 55:09.588
He was born almost a month late.

55:09.582 --> 55:12.403
Won a poetry competition when
he was eight and met Sarah Ferguson.

55:13.954 --> 55:18.550
Got the highest mark for
a first-year essay in Cardiff's
history.

55:18.550 --> 55:25.592
And somewhere in there, he was hit
by a bus and nearly killed, right?

55:27.158 --> 55:30.207
Why don't you tell me about that?

55:30.198 --> 55:31.745
Why that?

55:31.743 --> 55:33.586
Why not the good stuff?

55:33.582 --> 55:35.857
Because I'm not interested in it.

55:41.050 --> 55:43.905
Tell me what happened to
your brother, Elizabeth.

55:43.894 --> 55:45.054
From the start.

55:47.242 --> 55:51.030
(# LOW ANTHEM:

57:01.790 --> 57:04.258
Ooh! You said you were cold.

57:07.512 --> 57:11.403
I don't recognise it.

57:11.403 --> 57:13.803
It's Freddie's.

57:13.794 --> 57:14.954
Oh. Do you want me to get you
another one?

57:14.954 --> 57:17.593
No. It's fine. I'll keep it.

57:36.948 --> 57:39.712
You're doing so well, sweetheart.

57:41.368 --> 57:43.654
There's a bus coming.
Tony doesn't see it.

57:45.516 --> 57:47.177
He's distracted.

57:51.454 --> 57:54.958
It hits him. Runs him over.

57:54.948 --> 57:57.644
He's in the gutter
and he's bleeding.

57:59.255 --> 58:00.699
He looks dead.

58:02.782 --> 58:05.103
Open your eyes.

58:08.798 --> 58:10.129
Well done, Elizabeth.

58:10.122 --> 58:13.876
It's taken you three weeks
to tell me that story.

58:15.660 --> 58:16.684
How do you feel?

58:16.677 --> 58:18.121
Awful.

58:20.846 --> 58:23.314
I'd like us to try something now.

58:23.305 --> 58:25.990
I want you to close your eyes again

58:25.986 --> 58:29.478
and imagine that bus never hit Tony.

58:29.478 --> 58:31.378
Can you do that for me?

58:31.377 --> 58:32.605
But it did hit him.

58:32.602 --> 58:33.660
It's just an exercise.

58:33.658 --> 58:36.218
Try to imagine it never happened.

58:39.964 --> 58:41.818
OK.

58:45.134 --> 58:47.204
Make a picture in your head.

58:49.682 --> 58:51.832
What do you see?

58:52.938 --> 58:56.840
Tony, standing by the road.

58:57.964 --> 58:59.477
He's laughing.

58:59.470 --> 59:00.914
Good.

59:06.488 --> 59:07.420
Afternoon.

59:09.052 --> 59:11.327
How's the real world?

59:11.318 --> 59:13.604
Fine.

59:19.393 --> 59:22.157
Well, I don't know, actually.

59:22.146 --> 59:23.784
Me and Emily,

59:23.781 --> 59:29.356
we're all...
Since...the...

59:29.350 --> 59:32.376
You know.
And I don't know what we're doing,

59:32.368 --> 59:35.781
if we're OK or if we're about to
break up.

59:35.781 --> 59:39.808
Sometimes I think
she can read my mind.

59:39.804 --> 59:41.772
I seriously do.

59:41.770 --> 59:44.785
I mean, is that normal?

59:44.782 --> 59:46.545
Is that what you...?

59:50.287 --> 59:51.367
Eff?

59:51.358 --> 59:54.668
You think you're going mad,
so you came to see me

59:54.658 --> 59:56.614
to see what a mad person looks like?

59:56.605 --> 59:58.698
No!

59:58.696 --> 01:00:00.254
No.

01:00:02.639 --> 01:00:04.493
No.

01:00:04.488 --> 01:00:05.580
Yes.

01:00:05.576 --> 01:00:08.136
Listen to me very carefully, Naomi.

01:00:08.128 --> 01:00:11.234
You need to get a message
to the Dog Lord of Azerbaijan.

01:00:11.223 --> 01:00:12.884
He's got my toilet ticket.

01:00:20.094 --> 01:00:22.016
Oh, God, what are they giving you?!

01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:23.215
And can I have some?

01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:28.581
This whole thing
with this girl, Sophia.

01:00:28.573 --> 01:00:31.110
Why don't you just imagine
it never happened?

01:00:33.642 --> 01:00:35.325
But it did.

01:00:35.323 --> 01:00:40.010
Yeah, but if you tried to
think like you didn't...

01:00:40.002 --> 01:00:42.277
But...

01:00:44.572 --> 01:00:48.019
Am I missing something?

01:00:48.017 --> 01:00:50.611
You can't change
what's already happened.

01:00:50.604 --> 01:00:52.048
I wish you could.

01:00:53.002 --> 01:00:57.883
But...you just can't.

01:02:22.663 --> 01:02:26.064
..then Mrs White said-
Lucy, gotta go now. Bye.

01:02:29.864 --> 01:02:32.003
Whenever Dad calls,
he's always on his mobile.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.353
It's like he just
doesn't want to talk to me.

01:02:34.348 --> 01:02:36.293
Of course, he does...!

01:02:36.284 --> 01:02:38.559
I've just been talking to her.
She's really upset.

01:02:39.592 --> 01:02:41.196
It's your dad.

01:02:41.188 --> 01:02:42.962
Hey, Dad. Hey, Lucy-Lou.

01:02:43.376 --> 01:02:46.231
If a conversation's worth having,
use your BT landline.

01:02:46.226 --> 01:02:48.137
Oh, and Mum's getting married
to Adam.

01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:54.930
Uh-hm?

01:02:55.044 --> 01:02:57.080
(grunting and snorting)

01:02:58.042 --> 01:02:59.464
(grunting)

01:02:59.592 --> 01:03:00.536
THUD

01:03:03.481 --> 01:03:05.836
(slowing footsteps)

01:03:07.422 --> 01:03:09.037
(snorting)

01:03:09.778 --> 01:03:12.554
(grunting and growling)

01:03:14.651 --> 01:03:15.982
Mm-hm...

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.323
Hrrrgh!

01:03:19.058 --> 01:03:21.026
(low moan)

01:03:22.844 --> 01:03:23.742
What do you think?

01:03:24.775 --> 01:03:25.582
( Children laugh )
Sir, it suits you!

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:29.902
There you go, put that on your head,
that's lovely Princess Miranda...

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:30.881
( Children laugh )

01:03:30.877 --> 01:03:32.037
..I'm liking that, that's good!

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.156
Teaching children
about the solar system...

01:03:34.474 --> 01:03:35.736
..doesn't have to take
place in the classroom.

01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:39.334
If it's 0.6 it'll be...
..Twelve o'clock!
..It'll be 60.

01:03:39.331 --> 01:03:40.992
Here you go, that's 240 metres.

01:03:40.982 --> 01:03:41.892
And rotate please!

01:03:42.064 --> 01:03:43.952
Keep moving, spin.

01:03:43.948 --> 01:03:45.085
Keep going!

01:03:45.263 --> 01:03:46.457
( Children laugh )

01:03:46.631 --> 01:03:47.802
Mercyry, where are you going?!

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:52.125
Visit:

01:04:22.517 --> 01:04:23.734
Morning!

01:04:23.896 --> 01:04:25.170
Morning, love.

01:04:26.034 --> 01:04:28.662
Â£20? That's more than normal.

01:04:29.364 --> 01:04:31.764
How much have you
been spending at Tesco?

01:04:31.758 --> 01:04:33.202
Er, just the usual.

01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:36.170
She must be spending a fortune.
I mean, look what turned up.

01:04:36.311 --> 01:04:37.881
Perhaps she's having an affair?

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.721
Well, I mean,
she's a good-looking woman.

01:04:39.899 --> 01:04:42.390
You'll be saying I need
to start following her next.

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.902
# BANJO

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:53.162
At Tesco, you earn double
Clubcard points

01:04:53.368 --> 01:04:54.278
across
the store.

01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:55.769
So you used to get one point

01:04:55.906 --> 01:04:57.567
for every pound you spend -

01:04:57.738 --> 01:04:59.399
now you
get two.

01:04:59.591 --> 01:05:00.888
Hello, what are
you doing here?

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.304
Er...

01:05:02.526 --> 01:05:04.460
You left this
on the kitchen table.

01:05:04.453 --> 01:05:05.511
Oh...

01:05:05.508 --> 01:05:07.669
What would I do without you?!

01:05:07.935 --> 01:05:14.761
Earn twice as many
points at Tesco.
