The fork and the spoon
jumped over the moon ?

00:38.722 --> 00:39.723
no.

00:39.723 --> 00:40.724
[moans]

00:40.724 --> 00:41.975
you got a letter.

00:41.975 --> 00:42.976
[sniffing]

00:43.476 --> 00:44.728
it smells like the letters

00:44.728 --> 00:47.731
luanne used to get
from her mom in prison.

00:48.231 --> 00:50.200
Only prisonier.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.202
Hmm, "archer"?

00:52.202 --> 00:53.703
I don't know anyon
e named archer.

00:54.204 --> 00:54.954
[mumbling]

00:55.238 --> 00:58.241
hey, I've been pre-approved for a gold card.

00:58.241 --> 01:00.243
Who wants ice cream?

01:01.211 --> 01:02.212
Uh-oh.

[moaning]

01:03.713 --> 01:04.631
[peggy sighs]

01:04.631 --> 01:05.632
listen to this.

01:06.132 --> 01:07.634
It's from an old student
of mine.

01:07.634 --> 01:08.918
He's on death row.

01:09.886 --> 01:11.888
"and as I raise my hand

01:12.388 --> 01:14.390
"for possibly
my final question,

01:14.390 --> 01:17.894
"i hope that Miss peggy hill
will call on me one more time.

01:17.894 --> 01:19.896
"because she is
the person who has had

01:19.896 --> 01:22.899
"the most positive
impact on my life.

01:22.899 --> 01:25.902
Sincerely,
wesley martin archer."

01:25.902 --> 01:27.904
That's a good name
for a killer.

01:28.321 --> 01:29.322
What was he like, mom?

01:29.823 --> 01:31.825
Did he speak
real proper english,

01:31.825 --> 01:33.326
like an evil genius?

01:33.777 --> 01:36.780
I think maybe
he had wavy brown hair

01:36.780 --> 01:39.032
or was he that albino boy?

01:39.032 --> 01:41.534
Well, it'll all come back
to me when I see him.

01:41.534 --> 01:43.536
Oh, wait a second here.
You're not thinking

01:43.536 --> 01:45.371
of going into a prison,
are you?

01:45.371 --> 01:47.791
Hank, I am
a substitute teacher.

01:48.291 --> 01:49.793
I flit in and out
of people's lives,

01:50.293 --> 01:52.011
and I never know
if I've made a difference.

01:52.011 --> 01:54.631
With this boy,
I did make an impact.

01:54.931 --> 01:56.800
Uh, he's in prison, peggy.

01:58.635 --> 02:00.303
(hank)
dang it, peggy.
Some of these guys

02:00.637 --> 02:02.856
haven't seen a woman
since they killed their wives.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.390
If you're gonna
insist on going,

02:04.390 --> 02:06.392
do you have to be
all decked out

02:06.392 --> 02:07.894
?
like some disco dancer

02:08.394 --> 02:11.197
hank, please.
Death row is perfectly safe.

02:11.197 --> 02:13.199
There's a code of conduct
that all prisoners

02:13.199 --> 02:15.151
are obligated to obey.

02:15.151 --> 02:16.736
[car engine starts]

02:19.489 --> 02:20.740
I tell you what,
hank, man,

02:20.740 --> 02:22.625
she's like dang ol
d susan sarandon

02:22.625 --> 02:24.127
in that movie, man
, spicoli, man.

02:24.127 --> 02:26.880
Talking about
taste the waves
cool buzz, you know.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.882
Are you just
gonna joke your way

02:28.882 --> 02:30.884
through your
entire life, boomhauer?

02:31.384 --> 02:33.386
Don't snap at boomhaue
r just because

02:33.386 --> 02:35.221
you're losing control
of your woman.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.557
Believe me, hank,
if you don't stop it here,

02:37.557 --> 02:39.893
.
the next step'll be
cutting your allowance

02:39.893 --> 02:42.228
oh, you can't rein
peggy in, dale.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.230
Peggy's like a wild mare.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.232
She needs to run free,

02:46.232 --> 02:49.235
her chestnut mane
blowing in the wind,

02:49.235 --> 02:51.237
flanks glistening
with sweat.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.239
I'll stop now.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.741
Hey! Death row.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.026
?
You think peggy' s
gonna meet the executioner

02:57.327 --> 02:59.329
well, she only
mentioned the murderer.

02:59.329 --> 03:01.164
Executioning.

03:01.581 --> 03:05.585
For us exterminators,
that's the major league.

03:05.585 --> 03:06.586
The show.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.291
[yelps]

03:18.514 --> 03:19.382
[gate creaking]

03:25.972 --> 03:27.473
[metal detector beeping]

03:27.473 --> 03:29.525
empty your bag
on that table.

03:30.894 --> 03:32.145
We'll hold on to this.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.647
A con could use
a mascara applicator

03:34.647 --> 03:37.817
to scoop a man's eye
right out of his head.

03:38.651 --> 03:39.619
[door buzzing]

03:50.246 --> 03:51.998
hola, senora hill.

03:53.216 --> 03:55.551
You don't remember me.
That's ok.

03:55.551 --> 03:57.971
Someone like you
touches so many lives.

03:57.971 --> 04:01.174
Well, yes, I--I guess I do
. Who'd you kill?

04:01.674 --> 04:03.176
I killed myself.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.477
At least
I might as well have,

04:04.477 --> 04:06.145
as bad as I
feel about it.

04:06.145 --> 04:08.014
One night I went
with my buddy ray

04:08.014 --> 04:09.015
over to his friend's house.

04:09.515 --> 04:10.516
Only he wasn't home.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.019
So I gave ray
a boost up to the window.

04:13.019 --> 04:15.521
He couldn't climb up
and hold his gun

04:15.521 --> 04:16.822
at the same time.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.742
That's why we were there,
to return his friend's gun.

04:19.742 --> 04:22.578
Mmm-hmm, I can see where
this is going. Go on.

04:22.578 --> 04:24.080
So we get inside,

04:24.080 --> 04:26.082
and it turns out
the guy was home.

04:26.582 --> 04:29.419
He was screaming,
alarms were ringing,

04:29.419 --> 04:31.921
and when a guy yells,
"don't shoot!"

04:31.921 --> 04:34.540
believe me,
it has the opposite effect.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.542
I just panicked.
The next thing I know,

04:37.043 --> 04:38.428
his head was blown off.

04:38.428 --> 04:39.929
It would be
a comedy of errors

04:39.929 --> 04:41.214
.
if it wasn't so tragic

04:41.597 --> 04:42.932
now you don't Miss a thing,
do you?

04:44.434 --> 04:45.935
How do you say:

04:45.935 --> 04:49.722
"peggy hill is the smartest,
most talented woman on earth"

04:49.722 --> 04:51.024
in spanish?

04:51.024 --> 04:53.526
Well, hmm...

04:53.526 --> 04:57.030
That would be,
"peggy hill es bueno."

04:59.615 --> 05:01.617
The prison may think
10 back issues

05:01.617 --> 05:04.153
of us magazine
and a bible make a library,

05:04.153 --> 05:05.288
but I do not.

05:05.288 --> 05:07.290
Wesley needs more than that
to expand his mind.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.208
?
Why bother
helping him at all

05:09.208 --> 05:11.077
he's just
gonna be executed.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.245
Very nice, hank.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.746
You know,
wes had only the best things

05:13.746 --> 05:15.248
to say about you.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.083
He was supportive
about your problems
with your father.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.553
You gave a convict
personal information about...

05:20.553 --> 05:21.554
[gasps]

05:21.554 --> 05:23.306
how could you be that naive?

05:23.306 --> 05:24.640
Naive?

05:24.841 --> 05:27.477
Do you know what a prisoner
could do with this? I do.

05:27.477 --> 05:29.479
He could jab it
into your windpipe,

05:29.479 --> 05:30.980
and you would be dead
in 2 minutes.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.982
Glasses are not a weapon.

05:33.483 --> 05:35.818
Guns are a weapon.
You used to know that.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.238
What color
is your parachute?

05:39.238 --> 05:42.108
Is a wonderful boo
k about finding
your inner self.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.077
Oh, this is so great.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.413
Mrs. Hill, have you
ever played "what if?"

05:47.747 --> 05:49.248
"what if?"

05:49.248 --> 05:51.250
is that the one
where you guys see how quickly

05:51.250 --> 05:53.086
you can stab a knife
around your fingers?

05:53.419 --> 05:54.420
Oh, that game's fun,

05:54.921 --> 05:55.705
but I don't
think it has a name.

05:56.039 --> 05:59.092
Hmm. How about
"stab-scotch"?

05:59.092 --> 06:02.428
Stab-scotch.
That's real good, Mrs. Hill.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.764
But, uh, back to what if.

06:04.764 --> 06:06.766
I can't help thinking,
"what if

06:06.766 --> 06:09.268
mrs. Hill had been
my full-time teacher?"

06:09.268 --> 06:11.471
maybe I'd be able
to read these books.

06:11.471 --> 06:12.972
You can't read?

06:12.972 --> 06:14.857
Now, that is a crime.

06:14.857 --> 06:17.360
Look, I know it'd be
unfair to ask,

06:17.360 --> 06:20.780
but if you would come in
and tutor me, well, whoo.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.899
What's the happiest color
on earth?

06:22.899 --> 06:23.900
Yellow.

06:23.900 --> 06:27.070
Well, then my parachute
would be yellow.

06:27.537 --> 06:30.039
You gave that bastard
our travel version

06:30.039 --> 06:32.075
of the guinness
book of world records

06:32.075 --> 06:34.077
and now you're gonna
teach him to read it?

06:34.077 --> 06:36.579
Hank, I'm a teacher.
I sell knowledge.

06:36.579 --> 06:38.581
And it doesn't matter to who.

06:38.581 --> 06:39.499
Whom.

06:39.499 --> 06:40.500
Even murderers?

06:40.917 --> 06:43.553
You work with propane.
And that kills people.

06:43.553 --> 06:45.421
Only when used by people

06:45.421 --> 06:46.923
that don't know
how to handle it.

06:46.923 --> 06:48.424
And I know
how to handle it.

06:48.925 --> 06:51.260
And I know
how to handle myself.

06:51.260 --> 06:53.763
I am not some
corset-wearing lady

06:53.763 --> 06:55.264
who passes out
with the vapors

06:55.264 --> 06:57.567
at the drop of a hat
or a sudden garroting.

06:57.567 --> 06:58.818
[sighing]

06:58.818 --> 07:01.187
dang it, peggy.
I-- you can't just...

07:01.571 --> 07:03.940
.
Ok, that's it.
You leave me no choice

07:04.440 --> 07:06.943
u
for your own good,
I am forbidding yo

07:06.943 --> 07:08.161
to go back there.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.329
You forbid me?

07:10.329 --> 07:13.332
Unless you decide
on your own not to go,

07:13.833 --> 07:15.418
'cause I'll still
support that.

07:15.418 --> 07:17.837
Nobody forbids peggy hill.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.798
(peggy)
well, obviously,
since there's only one of you,

07:28.798 --> 07:30.349
I cannot grade on a curve.

07:30.349 --> 07:32.101
But every day
an assignment is late

07:32.101 --> 07:34.437
is one grade off
and a day in the hole.

07:34.437 --> 07:35.855
[laughing]

07:36.639 --> 07:38.191
oh, peggy.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.194
Oh, that's beautiful.

07:41.694 --> 07:42.478
Is that me?

07:42.778 --> 07:43.779
It's an apple.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.198
oh.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.151
So, you're telling me
you'll spray

07:48.651 --> 07:50.153
the entire prison
for just $1 a month?

07:50.570 --> 07:52.872
My word is my bond, sir.

07:53.156 --> 07:55.658
Due to the fact the state
wouldn't bond me

07:55.658 --> 07:57.293
or insure me.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.294
Mmm-hmm.

07:58.294 --> 08:01.297
Yeah, of course,
the invoice will say $2,000,

08:01.297 --> 08:02.715
but that's just procedure.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.218
I think we've got
ourselves a deal.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.502
[laughing]

08:06.502 --> 08:07.503
I read your manual,

08:07.503 --> 08:10.006
and as an official employee
of the prison system,

08:10.006 --> 08:12.508
I now qualify
to be the executioner.

08:12.508 --> 08:14.227
Yeah, where's old sparky?

08:14.227 --> 08:16.729
.
Old sparky's been
put out to pasture

08:16.729 --> 08:18.064
we use lethal injection.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.433
Ok, then where's old squirty?

08:20.433 --> 08:23.186
Dead is dead.
I don't care how we get there.

08:23.186 --> 08:25.188
Mr. Gribble,
generally we choose

08:25.188 --> 08:26.989
one of the guards
to be the executioner

08:27.356 --> 08:29.609
and there's a rather long list
of volunteers already.

08:29.942 --> 08:33.279
Put me on it.
Please, please, please.

08:33.279 --> 08:38.167
Well, all right.
You'll be number 129.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.452
Wingo!

08:39.619 --> 08:41.621
I'm gonna kill a killer ?

08:41.621 --> 08:43.005
I'm gonna kill a killer ??

08:53.466 --> 08:55.468
Mom, you're covering up
my essay

08:55.468 --> 08:57.303
on why pollution is bad.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.305
It got a "shows improvement."

08:59.305 --> 09:00.806
Sorry, bobby,but I guess

09:01.307 --> 09:03.309
we're just gonna have to
murder somebody

09:03.309 --> 09:05.811
if we want
your mom's attention.

09:05.811 --> 09:06.812
ok.

09:08.397 --> 09:10.449
[humming]

09:10.449 --> 09:11.784
hey, sam.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.152
[metal detector beeping]

09:14.120 --> 09:15.121
[metal detector beeping]
hold it.

09:15.621 --> 09:16.622
Oh, yeah!

09:23.462 --> 09:25.548
Wes, you're supposed
to start finding words.

09:25.548 --> 09:27.550
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hill.

09:28.050 --> 09:30.886
I'm just not used to
such creative teaching.

09:34.924 --> 09:36.926
Hey,don't you dare
touch her!

09:36.926 --> 09:38.344
You leave Mrs. Hill alone!

09:39.262 --> 09:40.263
[gasps]

09:40.646 --> 09:41.681
[grunting]

09:42.682 --> 09:44.066
no, stop it!

09:44.066 --> 09:45.568
[groaning]

09:45.568 --> 09:48.571
she's too good for you!
She's teaching me to read!

09:52.491 --> 09:53.359
Oh, good god.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.161
[birds chirping]

09:55.361 --> 09:56.862
??[humming]

09:59.365 --> 10:01.367
excuse me. Do you know
if these gloves

[laughing fiendishly]

10:11.210 --> 10:12.712
[sighing]

10:12.712 --> 10:14.714
it was only 3 days
in the pit.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.716
.
I thought the guard
was gonna touch your..

10:17.216 --> 10:18.351
Bottom.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.353
Oh, I tried to tell them
that you meant no harm,

10:20.853 --> 10:21.887
but they would not listen.

10:21.887 --> 10:25.391
Heck. They're all as dumb
as a bucket of dirt.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.193
Anyway, that's why
they hate boggle.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.811
They hate boggle?

10:28.811 --> 10:31.314
.
Only because
we love boggle

10:31.314 --> 10:33.783
when I was little,
my meema played

10:33.783 --> 10:36.285
on her boggle set
all the time.

10:36.285 --> 10:38.788
I just watched,
being illiterate and all,

10:38.788 --> 10:42.375
but I dreamed of someday
playing on that set.

10:43.626 --> 10:46.128
Peggy, if you get me
my boggle set,

10:46.128 --> 10:48.798
you could make
that dream come true.

10:48.798 --> 10:50.800
I am a dream weaver.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.918
[dog barking]

10:54.420 --> 10:56.922
so, jennette,
I did not realize

10:56.922 --> 10:58.891
they allowed
wesley conjugal visits.

10:58.891 --> 10:59.892
[train horn blowing]

10:59.892 --> 11:01.894
wes better
get the whole set.

11:06.649 --> 11:08.684
Oh, rock me, amadeus!

11:09.185 --> 11:11.187
Now, wes,
you shake the letters,

11:11.187 --> 11:12.488
not the timer.

11:12.488 --> 11:13.856
[laughing]

11:13.856 --> 11:14.857
oh, right.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.914
All right,
who covered wes' drawing
with this crap?

11:22.331 --> 11:24.333
Uh, peggy, I just
thought that

11:24.333 --> 11:26.836
maybe if you saw some
happy pictures

11:26.836 --> 11:30.289
you might do happy things,
like not visiting death row.

11:30.289 --> 11:32.758
Let me paint you
a happy picture, hank.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.760
A broken-down, illiterate man

11:34.760 --> 11:37.263
e
with nothing but death
staring him in the fac

11:37.263 --> 11:40.766
,
spells out the word "party
" with his family boggle set

11:40.766 --> 11:42.635
and then he croons
white christmas to me

11:42.635 --> 11:44.603
as I leave his cell
for the day.

11:44.603 --> 11:47.106
Now, that is
a happy picture, hank.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.479
And then everybody
started fighting,

11:53.479 --> 11:56.449
and the guards were in there
just a-swinging their clubs.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.451
And I--I couldn't get to
the boggle set in time.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.702
It was ruined?

11:59.702 --> 12:00.703
.
Oh, just the timer

12:00.703 --> 12:02.204
.
jennette will
give you a new one

12:03.205 --> 12:04.707
[birds chirping]

12:05.658 --> 12:07.660
wes is a little slow.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.795
He needs more time.

12:10.963 --> 12:11.964
Well, you realize

12:11.964 --> 12:13.966
.
that this is not
a regulation timer

12:13.966 --> 12:17.219
.
this will make
tournament play
impossible for wes

12:17.219 --> 12:18.220
oh.

12:18.220 --> 12:19.221
[police siren wailing]

12:19.221 --> 12:20.055
ok.

12:26.395 --> 12:28.898
I know it was stupid,
but we were playing

12:28.898 --> 12:30.900
out in the yard
and the top fell off.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.319
Jennette will give you
some more timer sand.

12:33.319 --> 12:34.987
What about
using a watch?

12:34.987 --> 12:37.690
Peggy, that's not real boggle.

give you one tiny hint.

12:52.838 --> 12:56.592
Oh, rats!
There's tar on my star-art.

wes, what is it?

I, uh, I can't let
the guard see me cry.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.016

If they sense
some weakness-

13:04.433 --> 13:06.936
Guard, could you pleas
e give us some space?

13:06.936 --> 13:09.722
You are inhibiting
his wordplay.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.607
I have something
to tell you.

13:11.607 --> 13:12.608
Can you hear me?

I can hear you

13:14.026 --> 13:15.027
good.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.196
Peggy, all this timer sand
you've been bringing me--

13:17.196 --> 13:18.531
.
Oh, don't mention that

13:18.531 --> 13:19.532
this is coke, peggy.

13:20.032 --> 13:21.033
You've been
smuggling me cocaine.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.035
That's a federal offense.
And you know what?

13:23.536 --> 13:24.904
You're gonna
bring me more of it.

13:25.287 --> 13:26.455
Is this some kind of a--

13:26.455 --> 13:27.957
How stupid can you be?

13:27.957 --> 13:31.410
I never had you as a teacher.
I grew up in arkansas.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.412
I'm almost 40
for cripe's sakes!

13:33.913 --> 13:35.915
I wrote every teacher
in the arlen yearbook.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.334

So all that about bein

13:40.336 --> 13:42.421

13:42.421 --> 13:43.923
Here's what you're gonna do.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.424
You're going to bring me

13:45.424 --> 13:46.926
a brick of cocaine
every week.

13:46.926 --> 13:48.310
And that's not all.

13:48.310 --> 13:50.312
You know what else
I want, peggy hill?

13:50.312 --> 13:52.064
2 times a month...

14:03.409 --> 14:07.663
My sloppy joe is
all sloppy and no joe.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.333
I forgot to add the meat.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.086
How could I be
so freaking stupid?

14:19.875 --> 14:21.877
Luanne, bobby,
why don't you go

14:21.877 --> 14:24.380

and go out for pizza?

Hank, I've been
smuggling cocaine in to wes.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.145
Smuggling cocaine?

14:40.145 --> 14:41.947
That's got to be illegal,
peggy.

14:42.281 --> 14:44.283
Well, I thought
it was boggle sand.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.786
Now he's making
all kinds of demands.

14:47.786 --> 14:51.290

14:59.298 --> 15:01.834
well, he certainly
revealed his true colors.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.336
I don't think you'll be
going back to see him again.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.840
Hank, I have to
or he will turn me in.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.508
They will send me to jail.

He has nothing to gain

15:22.021 --> 15:24.189
well, he has
nothing to lose either.

they always crumble.

15:42.758 --> 15:44.259

any more

15:44.259 --> 15:45.761

leave my wife alone.

Uh-huh.

15:49.632 --> 15:54.136
No, your ass is mine
because we've got a plan.

15:54.136 --> 15:56.639
Sure we do.
It's a terrific plan.

15:56.639 --> 15:59.642
We discarded
2 perfectly good plans

15:59.642 --> 16:02.728
when we came up
with this great one.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.731
Why didn't you tell me
about our terrific plan?

16:05.731 --> 16:07.650
Peggy, I made that up.

16:07.650 --> 16:10.319
And the other 2 plans?

16:10.319 --> 16:14.323
Uh, he says if he doesn't
get his coke by noon tuesday,

16:14.323 --> 16:16.709
he's gonna turn you in
just for fun.

16:20.329 --> 16:22.331
Look, just go to the warden,

16:22.331 --> 16:24.833
and tell him you were naiv
e and that wes tricked you.

16:24.833 --> 16:26.085
I can't.

watch a short film

of smuggling things
in to the prisoners.

I even got 100% on the tes
t they gave me afterwards.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.983
Well, you can't smuggl
e any more drugs in,

16:40.983 --> 16:42.434
that's for sure.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.436
Hey, what would happen
if we just gave wes

16:44.436 --> 16:46.238
a brick of
regular timer sand?

16:46.238 --> 16:47.773
Well, we can't do that.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.274
He is going
to deal this batch

16:49.274 --> 16:50.776
to the aryan brotherhood.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.278
If they think he tried
to pull a fast one--

16:53.278 --> 16:55.581
They would make
a pincushion out of him.

16:55.581 --> 16:59.451
Unless he tastes it.

16:59.451 --> 17:03.122
He always
tasted the timer sand
when I brought it in.

17:03.122 --> 17:05.624

I didn't think
anything of it at the time

it was very good timer sand.

isn't working.

17:25.477 --> 17:28.230
Hank, there's no dial tone.

17:28.230 --> 17:31.150
Oh! Hello? Well, this is
the freakiest thing.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.652
I didn't even hear
the phone ring. I was just--

17:33.652 --> 17:37.156
Yes, warden, I understand.
I will be there.

17:40.325 --> 17:44.413
Ok. He wants me to come in
and explain myself tomorrow.

17:44.413 --> 17:47.416
Well, I guess I'd better
make bobby's lunch

17:47.416 --> 17:49.418

2 to 5 years.

No, that's--that's not
what I meant to say.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.627
Uh, look, you said
the other day

18:31.627 --> 18:33.929

a positive impact
on anybody's life.

18:34.296 --> 18:36.799
Well, I want you to know
that you have.

18:36.799 --> 18:39.551
I-i'd hate to think
where bobby, luanne, and I

18:39.551 --> 18:41.019
would be without you.

did you smuggle cocain

?
into my prison

I came to this prison
to make an impact, to help.

19:46.418 --> 19:48.754
Help how?
By getting me hooked?

19:48.754 --> 19:50.873
Do you give all
your students drugs?

19:50.873 --> 19:53.292
That's not the right way
to motivate us.

19:53.292 --> 19:54.459
I never meant to--

19:54.459 --> 19:55.460
Tell him, peggy.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.962
Tell him about
the boggle timer.

19:57.379 --> 19:58.630
Stop rushing me.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.432
Come clean.
Tell him the truth.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.301
I came here
to tell the truth.

I would never dream
of telling anything else.

20:07.222 --> 20:08.223

20:17.482 --> 20:20.903
I never saw this man
before in my life.

20:20.903 --> 20:23.405
And--and what I mean
by that is

20:23.405 --> 20:25.407
I did not bring him cocaine.

20:25.407 --> 20:27.709
I would like to please see
the evidence against me.

20:34.583 --> 20:37.085
But there's
no cocaine in there.

20:37.085 --> 20:39.972
.
In fact, it looks like
it's been licked clean

20:39.972 --> 20:42.975
well, I--I had a little bit
left this morning

20:42.975 --> 20:44.476
but this was
an important meeting.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.011
I wanted to be
up for it.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.814
So, this is the only
evidence against me?

20:51.183 --> 20:52.684
It should be enough.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.521
I didn't bring in a thing.

20:56.521 --> 20:59.024
I swear to god
she smuggled
cocaine in to me!

20:59.524 --> 21:02.494
So, uh, I guess
it's this convict's word

21:02.494 --> 21:03.996
against my wife's.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.365
Now, let's see.
Who can we trust?

21:06.365 --> 21:08.867
Peggy, have you ever
decapitated anyone?

21:09.368 --> 21:11.753
No, I don't believe I have.
How about you, wes?

21:11.753 --> 21:13.038
[growling]

21:13.038 --> 21:14.039
g
have you ever done anythin

21:14.539 --> 21:16.008
that caused
a man's head to come off?

21:17.259 --> 21:18.677
[gasping]

21:19.011 --> 21:20.212
[grunting]

21:20.212 --> 21:22.214
[wes screaming]

21:22.214 --> 21:23.715
[wes groaning]

21:28.687 --> 21:31.189
well, I guess
someone owes me an apology.

21:31.189 --> 21:32.691
I wouldn't
hold your breath.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.693
d
I don't think
wes even apologize

21:34.693 --> 21:36.194
for those people
he killed.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.946
I was talking about you.

21:37.946 --> 21:40.065
Oh! I'm sorry.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.567
Well, do you even know
what you're apologizing for?

21:42.567 --> 21:45.570
No. I'm sorry,
but I don't.

21:45.570 --> 21:46.705
I accept.

21:47.205 --> 21:48.707
You apologized
because you said

21:48.707 --> 21:50.826
I couldn't take care
of myself, and I can.

21:50.826 --> 21:52.327
So there.
All right.

21:52.327 --> 21:54.329
I thought it had
something to do

21:54.329 --> 21:55.831
with the prison.

22:27.829 --> 22:30.115
(bobby)
all sloppy and no joe.

22:31.305 --> 22:37.588
