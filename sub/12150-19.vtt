00:02.529 --> 00:03.609
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:07.309
- Charles Gunn.
- Anne, meet Rondell and George.

00:07.929 --> 00:10.839
- Somebody could have told me.
- You ain't been around.

00:11.529 --> 00:14.550
You've been playing
demon-detective with your new family.

00:15.730 --> 00:18.149
Hands on the wall, spread your feet.

00:18.730 --> 00:20.239
Wait! Officer, wait!

00:21.730 --> 00:24.539
- He took a bullet for me.
- It was nothing.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.050
I see you guys have bonded.

00:27.730 --> 00:29.870
None of us are ready just yet--

00:30.129 --> 00:33.079
I don't want you to work for me.
I wanna work for you.

00:35.170 --> 00:36.219
Cordy!

00:36.570 --> 00:37.939
What did you see?

00:38.369 --> 00:40.859
Are these vision
hangovers getting longer?

00:41.369 --> 00:43.229
I wish it would stop hurting.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.850
- Want to try my sashimi?
- Raw fish?

00:47.969 --> 00:49.759
Maybe when hell freezes over.

00:50.369 --> 00:51.810
What are you looking for?

00:52.170 --> 00:56.310
Celebrities. They won't put them out
here. They put them back in the dark.

00:56.969 --> 00:59.570
Not like here, where
it's bright and open...

01:00.570 --> 01:03.130
...and everyone can
stare at you and....

01:05.969 --> 01:08.390
It's a little exposed. Kind of public.

01:08.969 --> 01:12.090
That public thing. It happens
when you go where people are.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.239
No, I like people.
Normal people.

01:15.569 --> 01:18.310
I wanna be one,
celebrate Cordy's good news.

01:19.170 --> 01:23.099
- It's just a commercial.
- A national commercial. Here's to you.

01:23.969 --> 01:27.340
I can't drink. I have to be up
at 4:30 a.m. for the shoot.

01:28.170 --> 01:30.769
But continue toasting and praising.

01:31.170 --> 01:34.750
- You'll knock them dead.
- Don't leave us when you get famous.

01:35.370 --> 01:36.629
Don't worry.

01:37.170 --> 01:41.739
I can't leave you guys while I'm still
the owner of debilitating visions.

01:46.769 --> 01:48.349
I feel a little guilty.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.329
Don't.

01:50.969 --> 01:55.540
A $19 sashimi couscous appetizer
is money well spent.

01:56.370 --> 01:58.540
How is it? Good? It ought to be good.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.230
Delicious, but that's
not why I feel guilty.

02:04.170 --> 02:05.709
I'm not cheap, I'm old.

02:05.969 --> 02:10.288
I remember when a few bob got you a
meal, a bottle and a tavern wench.

02:14.370 --> 02:16.189
- You were saying?
- I was saying...

02:16.770 --> 02:20.419
...I feel guilty leaving you guys
mid-case to do a commercial.

02:20.969 --> 02:23.810
Angel will contact his
informant in the morning.

02:24.569 --> 02:27.310
- Is it a he or an it?
- Actually, both.

02:28.169 --> 02:31.219
Then it/he points us to the thing
you saw in your vision.

02:31.770 --> 02:35.069
The Haklar demon. The
informant will lead us to its grounds...

02:35.370 --> 02:38.810
...where we manly men will
gather around and kill it to death.

02:39.569 --> 02:40.969
Sounds like fun.

02:43.169 --> 02:44.750
If you guys want more wine....

02:45.569 --> 02:48.340
Not for me. That imported
stuff goes to your head.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.979
- Should we get a flame thrower?
- For the Haklar?

02:52.770 --> 02:54.139
If you want another bottle--

02:54.569 --> 02:57.520
If we're in a tight space,
we could burn each other.

02:58.169 --> 02:59.500
Right, right.

02:59.969 --> 03:01.930
You're the boss. You'll decide.

03:02.370 --> 03:06.409
A flame thrower is big and loud.
It might call unwanted attention.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.729
Stealth being a larger part of--

03:10.689 --> 03:13.569
- Isn't this interesting?
- What? My shawl?

03:13.689 --> 03:16.500
- Shroud woven of a child's skin.
- What's he doing?

03:17.289 --> 03:20.979
I know a Voctar witch when I see one!
I can read the markings--

03:22.090 --> 03:25.069
- Looks different up close.
- It's beautiful, ma'am.

03:26.289 --> 03:30.860
It's a beautiful, thousand-dollar
Laura Mina original.

03:32.289 --> 03:36.289
My friend loves beautiful things
so much, he can't control himself.

03:37.090 --> 03:40.639
Because he's from France.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.979
We're so sorry. So sorry.

03:49.090 --> 03:52.740
We could set the table on fire with a
flame thrower, draw more attention.

03:53.289 --> 03:57.189
- Those markings, from afar, looked--
- Let's just eat and go without--

03:58.090 --> 03:59.389
Oh, God.

03:59.889 --> 04:01.819
- What is it? What do you see?
- Moo--

04:02.289 --> 04:06.009
- Moo? Some sort of cow-monster?
- Move! The sashimi's coming up.

04:12.490 --> 04:14.419
They'll take that off the bill.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:08.290 --> 05:09.589
Yes, Mum.

05:11.209 --> 05:13.459
Yes, well, put him on.

05:14.209 --> 05:16.699
Right. You too.

05:19.009 --> 05:21.680
Hello, Father. Happy birthday.

05:22.689 --> 05:23.920
How are you?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.500
Good.

05:26.889 --> 05:28.959
No, it's going quite well, actually.

05:29.290 --> 05:30.449
Yes.

05:31.089 --> 05:34.779
I have news. I've been put
in charge of our group.

05:35.889 --> 05:37.470
Yes, as their leader.

05:38.889 --> 05:42.259
No, it's a permanent position.
As permanent as these things--

05:44.889 --> 05:46.959
No, I certainly won't be fired.

05:49.689 --> 05:53.660
Well, yes, I was that one time. Yes.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.209
Again. No, you're right.
I see how you--

06:00.490 --> 06:02.279
Yes, I'd forgotten. Thank you.

06:05.290 --> 06:06.480
Yes.

06:07.689 --> 06:11.829
Just recently. It's going
quite well so far.

06:15.490 --> 06:17.170
No, I think this time--

06:18.490 --> 06:20.420
I hope it will be different.

06:22.689 --> 06:25.459
No. No, you're right.
I see how you--

06:26.889 --> 06:30.399
I just thought you'd be--
I thought you'd want to know.

06:31.689 --> 06:36.040
Right. Well, again, happy birthday.

06:37.089 --> 06:38.139
Okay.

06:44.889 --> 06:46.220
Talking to someone?

06:46.689 --> 06:49.040
- My father.
- English, Sr.? How is he?

06:49.689 --> 06:52.250
- Well. It's his birthday.
- Nice.

06:53.889 --> 06:56.629
He sends his greetings
to all in Tinseltown.

07:08.410 --> 07:10.089
Sorry.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.350
What are you doing here?

07:43.810 --> 07:45.670
Getting a tan.

07:46.209 --> 07:48.209
Not bursting into flames.

07:49.209 --> 07:51.600
So, what are you doing here?

07:52.209 --> 07:54.420
In your vision, did the Haklar--?

07:55.209 --> 07:57.350
Shut up! Seth,
the director, is coming.

07:57.610 --> 08:01.750
- Hi. Thanks for casting me.
- You're welcome. Lose the bathrobe.

08:03.009 --> 08:05.009
- Excuse me?
- You don't speak English?

08:06.009 --> 08:09.910
The wardrobe, I need to see it.
Lose the robe, princess.

08:10.810 --> 08:12.209
Sure, sure.

08:18.610 --> 08:19.689
Turn around.

08:24.009 --> 08:27.199
Well, nothing wrong there.
Okay, turn.

08:32.409 --> 08:34.830
- When does she go to makeup?
- I've been to makeup.

08:35.409 --> 08:39.480
Take her back and tell David to get
rid of the circles under her eyes.

08:40.210 --> 08:42.879
She looks like an abused woman.

08:43.808 --> 08:46.929
- I had food poisoning.
- Yeah, right. You eat. Good one.

08:47.409 --> 08:50.009
I should want to sleep with her.
I don't.

08:50.409 --> 08:53.360
- Do you? Of course you don't.
- You're out of line.

08:55.809 --> 08:57.490
Apologize to her.

08:58.210 --> 09:01.259
Let me guess. Wannabe rocker
or part-time male model.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.490
- Could be either.
- Apologize.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.820
- Billy, get security.
- Angel--

09:06.009 --> 09:09.129
- Who the hell you think you are?
- I'm the director.

09:10.210 --> 09:13.720
You're smart bringing your
unemployed boyfriend onto my set...

09:14.409 --> 09:17.149
...to tell me how to film.
Really helps your career.

09:17.409 --> 09:20.389
- Sorry. He won't bother you anymore.
- I know.

09:21.009 --> 09:23.110
Security's gonna toss his ass.

09:24.009 --> 09:27.169
Now get into makeup and
hope they can work miracles.

09:28.809 --> 09:33.340
Want me to rip his head off?
I can rip his head right off his body.

09:34.210 --> 09:38.600
Are you trying to ruin my career?
Is this a conscious effort on your part?

09:39.610 --> 09:43.049
- No, I just--
- You need to go now.

09:44.409 --> 09:48.200
- Why are you still here? Go!
- I have to ask you a question.

09:50.409 --> 09:51.600
What?

09:52.809 --> 09:57.090
In your vision, did the Haklar eat
his victim whole or rip out the liver?

09:58.210 --> 09:59.889
According to my informant...

10:00.009 --> 10:03.169
...liver-eaters feed differently
than people-eaters.

10:04.210 --> 10:06.769
I have to know which it was
so I can kill it.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.870
I hate my whole life.

10:24.529 --> 10:26.950
This Heckler demon
we're supposed to kill--

10:28.129 --> 10:32.700
- Haklar. Two A's.
- This Haklar we're supposed to kill.

10:33.529 --> 10:35.700
Give me the specs.
What should I know?

10:36.529 --> 10:41.100
The Haklar, descended from the Klenzen
demons, can weigh up to three tons.

10:41.929 --> 10:46.039
It awakes from hibernation during
full moons only to feed and mate.

10:46.730 --> 10:51.299
Often simultaneously. Incapable of
speech, they learned to communicate...

10:52.129 --> 10:55.610
...via a complex pattern
of timed facial tics...

10:56.330 --> 10:58.470
...similar to our own Morse code.

10:58.730 --> 11:00.799
It prefers a warm, moist climate--

11:01.730 --> 11:03.200
- Wesley.
- Yes?

11:03.529 --> 11:05.779
I meant how do we kill it?

11:09.529 --> 11:12.269
Your standard slice-and-dice.

11:14.929 --> 11:15.980
Hey!

11:17.330 --> 11:19.610
- What are y'all doing?
- Got a situation.

11:19.730 --> 11:21.590
You remember Rondell and George.

11:22.129 --> 11:24.519
Certainly. I never
thanked you properly.

11:25.129 --> 11:27.519
- I owe you men my life.
- It's cool.

11:28.129 --> 11:30.129
You got shot because
you had our backs.

11:30.529 --> 11:33.059
- How you feeling?
- Better, thank you.

11:33.529 --> 11:35.779
- What's the situation?
- Vamps.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.740
Making Mackenzie Park
their new restaurant.

11:39.529 --> 11:41.490
- Many homeless there.
- They're the meals.

11:41.929 --> 11:45.409
- Sounds like we need to set a trap.
- Trap's already set.

11:46.129 --> 11:47.389
It is?

11:47.929 --> 11:50.389
We know the drill.
Everything's in motion.

11:50.929 --> 11:53.879
- You just need me to--
- Lend us your truck.

11:54.529 --> 11:56.529
- My ride?
- It's still tricked out for dusting?

11:57.529 --> 12:01.250
- Yeah, but--
- We wanna go in with all we got.

12:02.929 --> 12:04.889
- Count me in.
- And the Haklar?

12:05.330 --> 12:06.769
Angel finds it, page me.

12:07.129 --> 12:11.169
It lives by Lake Hollywood.
Let's hurry. A 5K race starts there soon.

12:11.929 --> 12:13.789
Consider yourself paged.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.529
I gotta take this. Wait for me.

12:20.929 --> 12:23.559
We'll hook up at base camp
and go out together.

12:24.529 --> 12:27.159
Whatever, G. Let's roll, Ron.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.679
Angel, is everything all right?

12:38.330 --> 12:40.360
- It's Cordy.
- What about her?

12:40.730 --> 12:42.690
- More headaches?
- What happened?

12:43.129 --> 12:45.340
Nothing happened.
It's just....

12:46.730 --> 12:49.470
Acting's her dream?
She wants to live that?

12:50.330 --> 12:52.860
- With those people? I don't get it.
- Who?

12:53.330 --> 12:57.399
Mr. I'm-a-Commercial-Director-
So-I'm-the-Center-of-the-Universe?

12:58.129 --> 13:00.659
If you're not in showbiz,
you're a step down.

13:01.129 --> 13:04.009
We only save the world.
The way he talks to her!

13:05.330 --> 13:08.169
It's like she's his commodity
or his slave.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.769
The worst part? She took it.
When has she taken crap from us?

13:12.529 --> 13:15.129
- Never. And the day after never.
- Exactly.

13:15.529 --> 13:19.289
He's also got her wearing this
flimsy swimsuit that covers, like...

13:21.529 --> 13:23.460
...nothing.

13:28.730 --> 13:30.899
- Appalling.
- Disgusting.

13:32.929 --> 13:35.629
- Shouldn't we be killing something?
- Absolutely.

13:35.929 --> 13:38.419
Good. Let's get this show on the road.

13:39.250 --> 13:41.110
Very superstitious

13:43.490 --> 13:45.139
The devil's on his way

13:52.330 --> 13:53.940
A broken looking-glass

13:56.529 --> 13:59.549
Seven years of bad luck

14:01.929 --> 14:03.230
Good things in your past

14:06.730 --> 14:10.309
Oh, if you believe in things
that you don't understand

14:11.529 --> 14:13.669
Then you suffer
Superst--

14:40.769 --> 14:44.559
It's okay. Everything's fine.
Nothing to worry about.

14:45.570 --> 14:47.600
It's all part of the show.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.600
It goes on smooth like a lover's kiss.

14:51.690 --> 14:55.480
It's the only suntan lotion
good enough for our man.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.419
Cut! Cut!

15:02.490 --> 15:04.519
- You're in his light.
- Still?

15:04.769 --> 15:07.299
I told you, you have
to bend over more.

15:07.769 --> 15:10.929
If I bend over more,
I'll fall out of my top.

15:11.970 --> 15:15.200
Then you'll be out of his light.
Everyone wins.

15:15.570 --> 15:19.570
- Isn't there something we--?
- You aren't here to play Ophelia.

15:20.970 --> 15:25.539
Show cleavage, say the line.
Or do you wanna waste more time?

15:26.970 --> 15:28.129
Got it.

15:37.409 --> 15:40.179
- Has it--?
- Stopped bleeding? Yeah.

15:42.210 --> 15:44.029
Cordelia.

15:45.809 --> 15:47.039
Hi.

15:51.809 --> 15:54.440
Look, if I was out of line today--

15:55.409 --> 15:57.830
If you were out of line? If?

15:58.409 --> 16:02.549
You're comfortable with your use
of the word "if" here, are you?

16:06.210 --> 16:08.490
Sorry I embarrassed you.

16:10.409 --> 16:14.450
Who am I kidding?
I embarrassed myself.

16:15.210 --> 16:17.529
I just wanted to act, that's all.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.700
For them to appreciate my talent.

16:23.610 --> 16:26.029
I never wanted to feel like this.

16:28.409 --> 16:32.549
- Wasn't Gunn with you?
- He had to take care of some vampires.

16:33.210 --> 16:34.720
How was the big fight?

16:35.009 --> 16:39.009
We killed it just before
it devoured some power walkers.

16:39.809 --> 16:41.000
- Horrible.
- I know.

16:41.610 --> 16:43.429
I saw it in my vision.

16:44.009 --> 16:48.190
Not the Haklar, the walkers.
Walking I get, but power walking?

16:48.809 --> 16:51.759
Why not run for a shorter time?

16:52.409 --> 16:53.490
Weird.

16:54.210 --> 16:56.419
- One of them hit him.
- A walker?

16:57.210 --> 17:00.509
She felt I disrespected
the Haklar's culture.

17:01.409 --> 17:03.340
This town sucks.

17:08.009 --> 17:11.730
Am I happy to see you!
You're still a knight for hire, yeah?

17:12.210 --> 17:14.670
I'm hiring. I need you
to kill something.

17:15.809 --> 17:18.720
Here are the particulars:
It's a Drokken.

17:19.410 --> 17:21.368
- Drokken?
- It's not in the books.

17:21.809 --> 17:23.809
- It's from another world.
- How so?

17:24.210 --> 17:27.970
Portal. Right in the middle
of my tune. Threw me off.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.660
I hate to disappoint an audience.

17:31.410 --> 17:33.579
What's important is you kill it.

17:34.410 --> 17:37.460
I can't stress enough.
Kill it. You must.

17:38.009 --> 17:40.039
- Where is it?
- No idea.

17:41.009 --> 17:44.490
But I imagine it's getting
pretty hungry by now.

18:10.410 --> 18:12.440
- That's it?
- Why is it here?

18:12.809 --> 18:15.089
What's it want?
What's it capable of?

18:15.809 --> 18:18.440
Who cares? It trashed
my club, my clientele.

18:19.410 --> 18:23.309
Isn't violence was impossible there?
Isn't it a sanctuary?

18:24.210 --> 18:28.740
I didn't say it killed anyone.
It knocked over a few of my regulars.

18:30.809 --> 18:33.440
There were angry glances.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.730
I sensed some bad intentions.

18:38.009 --> 18:41.700
Not a nice fella. Bad beast.
Did I mention the teeth?

18:42.210 --> 18:45.470
- You mentioned them.
- Are you gonna help me?

18:46.410 --> 18:49.670
We can start at Caritas,
do a circular search.

18:50.009 --> 18:51.309
Hope we get lucky.

18:51.809 --> 18:52.579
Angel....

18:55.410 --> 18:58.500
I didn't mean
to step on your toes, Wesley.

18:59.609 --> 19:00.660
Quite all right.

19:00.809 --> 19:03.759
- He's our leader.
- It's been a long time coming.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.759
Kudos. Nice choice of conductor.

19:07.410 --> 19:10.960
- So what do we do now?
- Well, um....

19:16.410 --> 19:20.980
Angel's right. A circular search
for the beast seems best.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.269
I like it.

19:25.410 --> 19:26.950
Hey, what's with her?

19:28.410 --> 19:31.319
Food poisoning.
Very expensive appetizers.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.829
Or possibly a vision.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.660
- Okay?
- Why does everyone ask me that?

19:49.450 --> 19:50.640
Do I look okay?

19:50.650 --> 19:54.480
- What'd you see?
- A woman at the public library.

19:55.490 --> 19:58.299
She works there.
She was reading a book.

19:59.089 --> 20:02.529
As scary as that sounds,
crazed Drokken on the loose.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.450
I was here first.

20:05.690 --> 20:10.009
There was an opening behind her.
Something magical. A portal.

20:11.089 --> 20:12.980
- A portal?
- A portal?

20:13.490 --> 20:17.460
- Like the one the Drokken used?
- We don't know that.

20:18.210 --> 20:20.839
Let's get the library.
They close soon.

20:23.009 --> 20:25.710
Great, The Powers That Be
have an interest in--

20:26.009 --> 20:29.309
I mean--The problem I brought you.
What a break.

20:30.210 --> 20:31.609
You coming?

20:32.009 --> 20:35.450
I...thought you'd never ask.

20:43.049 --> 20:45.299
Junior, where is everybody?

20:49.049 --> 20:50.210
What's wrong?

21:20.849 --> 21:21.900
What--?

21:28.650 --> 21:32.059
- Did they make him drink?
- We don't know.

21:38.450 --> 21:40.910
I have the weirdest sense of déjà vu.

21:41.450 --> 21:45.839
How come you and me always end up
in a library? Let's do something fun.

21:46.250 --> 21:49.339
- Like what?
- Elton's in town. Back row seats?

21:50.450 --> 21:51.779
I don't do crowded.

21:52.250 --> 21:54.529
Elton starts "Yellow Brick Road"...

21:54.650 --> 21:57.210
...you feel like the only person there.

22:00.049 --> 22:02.299
Hi. How are you?

22:03.049 --> 22:06.420
You...you're...

22:07.250 --> 22:11.430
...here for the children's program.
- Yes. Yes, I am.

22:12.049 --> 22:13.420
- It's tomorrow.
- Yes.

22:13.849 --> 22:16.660
I don't perform without
checking the space.

22:17.450 --> 22:21.170
Oh! Well, the kids will flip
over your costume.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.109
- It looks so real.
- Thanks.

22:24.650 --> 22:28.930
- Not the horns. They're hard to fake.
- If you only knew.

22:29.450 --> 22:31.799
The reading area's down that way.

22:32.450 --> 22:34.910
Toodles. See you
and the munchkins tomorrow.

22:36.650 --> 22:38.579
We close in five minutes.

22:39.049 --> 22:41.470
We're looking for
a woman who works here.

22:42.049 --> 22:44.609
- Who's that?
- Okay. She's tall.

22:45.650 --> 22:48.910
She has brown hair.
Wears glasses. Pretty.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.119
Sorry.

22:52.250 --> 22:56.710
She wears a locket, shaped like a
ball or an apple, I think.

22:57.650 --> 23:00.529
An apple? Fred wore one of those.

23:01.250 --> 23:03.920
- Fred?
- Winifred. We called her Fred.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.829
Do you know where she is?

23:12.650 --> 23:15.880
She disappeared five years ago.
They never found her.

23:16.250 --> 23:19.019
Police said if she didn't show up, well....

23:19.849 --> 23:22.410
- We stopped hoping long ago.
- This is her.

23:22.849 --> 23:24.220
Tell us about her?

23:24.650 --> 23:28.160
She worked with me.
She wanted to be a physicist.

23:28.849 --> 23:32.079
- The day she disappeared--
- Oh.... It was creepy.

23:33.650 --> 23:37.369
She was cataloging in Foreign Language
and then she was gone.

23:42.049 --> 23:46.299
Angel, why don't you look there?
I'll look over here and....

23:47.450 --> 23:51.450
- Why are we here?
- I saw the portal here in my vision.

23:52.250 --> 23:56.460
The reading room? To die for!
Stage, chair, fabulous colors.

23:57.049 --> 23:58.589
I'm tempted to come tomorrow.

23:58.849 --> 24:01.309
We're doing what you wanted us to do.

24:01.849 --> 24:04.170
I liked that search pattern you pitched.

24:05.450 --> 24:07.059
Are we going to do that?

24:07.250 --> 24:11.079
Here it is. This is the book that
Fred had in my vision.

24:12.650 --> 24:15.980
"Scrsqwrn." What language is that?

24:16.849 --> 24:19.480
Last checked out May 6, 1996...

24:19.849 --> 24:21.990
...and returned May 7, 1996.

24:22.849 --> 24:24.500
The day she disappeared.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.710
"Pat, I'll buy a vowel."

24:59.970 --> 25:02.180
Landok? Is that you?

25:05.369 --> 25:08.559
- You know him?
- That doesn't mean you should stop.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.970
- Please continue.
- Can it be you?

25:11.970 --> 25:14.039
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan?

25:14.369 --> 25:16.369
- Do it, Angel.
- Krevlornswath?

25:16.769 --> 25:18.490
Of the Deathwok Clan?

25:19.170 --> 25:21.240
- I prefer Lorne.
- Lorne?

25:21.569 --> 25:25.259
Yes, Lorne. Though I
generally don't go by that....

25:26.089 --> 25:27.670
- Green?
- Huh?

25:28.490 --> 25:30.490
Right! Lorne Greene.

25:30.890 --> 25:32.259
Bonanza?

25:33.289 --> 25:35.849
15 years on the air
means nothing to you?

25:36.890 --> 25:38.920
Okay, now I feel old.

25:40.490 --> 25:42.910
- What is this place?
- Los Angeles.

25:43.490 --> 25:46.369
- This isn't a hot spot.
- Is it a prison?

25:47.089 --> 25:50.210
Whoa, big fella. Put it down.
They're friends.

25:50.690 --> 25:52.900
Angel, Cordelia, Wesley...

25:53.690 --> 25:57.480
- ...this is Landok.
- Landokmar of the Deathwok Clan.

25:58.490 --> 25:59.789
Deathwok Clan again.

26:00.289 --> 26:02.430
- The two of you are--
- Cousins.

26:02.690 --> 26:06.269
- Your cousin?
- Your vanishing was a great mystery.

26:07.490 --> 26:10.970
Long story, boring ending.
It wouldn't interest you.

26:11.690 --> 26:15.309
We hoped you died atoning
in the Sacrificial Canyons of Trelinsk.

26:15.890 --> 26:18.240
It's been fun. But we have to go.

26:18.890 --> 26:21.799
You'll be fine.
New people come to L.A. each day.

26:22.490 --> 26:25.160
Were you abducted here?

26:26.089 --> 26:30.369
- I came by portal.
- We will find a path back to our home.

26:31.490 --> 26:34.160
- We'll go together.
- My ticket was one-way.

26:35.089 --> 26:38.529
You won't return to remove shame
from your Life-Giver?

26:39.289 --> 26:42.059
Is anyone else hungry?
How about Italian?

26:42.289 --> 26:46.500
- Your mother's burden is terrible.
- Misses me, does she?

26:47.690 --> 26:49.230
She rips your images...

26:49.490 --> 26:52.509
...and feeds them to swine.
Butchers them...

26:53.089 --> 26:56.569
- ...and feeds them to dogs.
- That's Ma. You pick.

26:57.289 --> 26:58.799
I'm game for anything.

26:59.089 --> 27:00.839
- You coward.
- These people...

27:01.490 --> 27:04.259
- ...don't care about our family.
- Sure we do.

27:05.089 --> 27:07.160
Yes! Let's hear about it.

27:07.490 --> 27:10.440
Okay, for your information,
not a coward.

27:11.089 --> 27:15.269
We were just on a Drokken hunt.
We must return to it.

27:15.890 --> 27:17.920
- Excuse us--
- A Drokken's near?

27:18.890 --> 27:20.960
- I will assist.
- Find your own.

27:21.289 --> 27:24.450
- How do we kill it?
- Pierce it with thromite.

27:24.890 --> 27:29.240
Sorry, cuz. Thromite: not exactly
existing in this world. Thanks.

27:30.289 --> 27:32.849
Killing it will be most difficult.

27:33.890 --> 27:35.500
- Decapitation?
- Stabbing?

27:35.690 --> 27:39.099
- Electrocution?
- We've had luck with that before.

27:39.890 --> 27:44.069
You must use thromite. The Drokken's
strong and fast, hard to hit.

27:44.690 --> 27:47.220
- We gotta find it first.
- I can track it.

27:48.289 --> 27:51.130
- You can?
- It leaves waves of hostility.

27:51.890 --> 27:56.069
And you can read these waves?
All your people do this?

27:56.690 --> 28:00.450
- Those who submit to training.
- Everybody on board.

28:01.490 --> 28:04.470
- Guilt trip leaving.
- Show me where it appeared.

28:05.089 --> 28:07.789
- I will help you.
- We welcome your help.

28:27.289 --> 28:31.190
- You should've waited for me.
- We've been waiting for months.

28:47.690 --> 28:50.009
Our path is true, our arrival late.

28:50.690 --> 28:54.170
The Drokken has consumed.
It'll be at maximum power.

29:00.890 --> 29:02.150
What's he doing?

29:02.089 --> 29:04.690
He's channeling to identify its aura.

29:05.690 --> 29:08.710
I use that to find destiny, and I'm a freak.

29:09.289 --> 29:12.980
He uses it to hunt,
he's the golden spawn. Go figure.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.769
So he's a hero back home?

29:16.490 --> 29:20.140
Talk about weird values.
A world of only good and evil.

29:20.690 --> 29:22.089
Black and white.

29:22.490 --> 29:23.650
No music, no art.

29:24.289 --> 29:28.930
Just champions roaming the country
fighting for justice. Boring.

29:29.690 --> 29:31.789
Problems solved with a sword.

29:32.690 --> 29:36.970
No one admits to having feelings
and emotions or talks about them.

29:37.490 --> 29:41.670
- Can you imagine living like that?
- Not really.

29:45.289 --> 29:48.619
Why isn't Gunn answering?
What if he's in trouble?

29:48.890 --> 29:51.839
Maybe he's in the middle
of his stake-o-rama.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.819
Last time we went chasing
after him, you got shot.

29:56.690 --> 29:57.950
Point taken.

29:59.690 --> 30:02.220
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

30:04.490 --> 30:07.259
- We're missing something.
- When we get back...

30:08.089 --> 30:11.210
- ...I'll decipher it.
- I mean something bigger.

30:12.289 --> 30:14.009
- Like what?
- I don't know.

30:14.089 --> 30:18.369
I feel like we're chasing after
the monster, which is good...

30:19.490 --> 30:21.490
...but we're missing something.

30:23.089 --> 30:26.319
It's this way. The aura's strong.
It's not far.

30:28.490 --> 30:31.900
- What do you want, a medal?
- Krevlornswath mocks me?

30:32.690 --> 30:34.369
Just the L.A. in me.

30:35.089 --> 30:39.660
The Krevlornswath who refused
the traditional hunting and gathering?

30:40.490 --> 30:43.470
I'll tell you a secret.
While you were hunting...

30:44.089 --> 30:47.349
...I was with the señoritas,
gathering a little love.

30:47.690 --> 30:51.339
- You brought cowardice to the joust.
- For the last time...

30:52.490 --> 30:55.819
...not a coward.
I saw both sides of the joust.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.630
How can you joust someone
when you agree with them?

31:01.490 --> 31:03.839
It has taken food to consume later.

31:04.490 --> 31:05.359
More food?

31:07.490 --> 31:09.029
Oh, you mean people?

31:09.890 --> 31:12.490
Oh! You mean people!

31:28.450 --> 31:30.480
You sure this is where it came?

31:35.049 --> 31:36.309
I am sure.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.829
What do we do, Wesley?

31:39.250 --> 31:40.690
We don't have Gunn.

31:41.049 --> 31:43.789
- If it's as strong as Landok says--
- Yeah?

31:44.650 --> 31:48.059
I have flares.
The light will distract him...

31:48.849 --> 31:51.450
- ...long enough for us to--
- Enough words!

31:53.650 --> 31:56.109
Patience: not a virtue with my people.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.710
Angel, what are you-- What are you....

32:04.450 --> 32:06.549
But we don't have a plan.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.329
- Where is my sword?
- You're hurt.

32:33.049 --> 32:35.079
- Fetch it.
- You're poisoned.

32:36.049 --> 32:38.819
- There's time to die later.
- Poisoned?

32:39.650 --> 32:42.460
The Drokken's bite is deadly
to my people.

32:42.650 --> 32:45.210
- Is there an antidote?
- Back in our world.

32:57.650 --> 32:59.369
It's going after the woman.

33:20.210 --> 33:23.400
Find her, get her out.
I'll find the Drokken.

33:32.809 --> 33:36.039
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan,
my sword!

33:37.009 --> 33:40.450
Hello? Martyr complex?
You can't even lift your arm.

33:51.410 --> 33:53.799
Hey, you want food?

33:55.009 --> 33:56.549
I can be food.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.299
Pretty tasty here.

34:02.210 --> 34:04.599
Come on, where are you?

34:11.809 --> 34:14.230
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

34:16.010 --> 34:17.800
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

34:38.809 --> 34:41.760
It's all right.
I'll get you out of here.

34:43.010 --> 34:44.409
Don't be scared.

35:23.570 --> 35:25.219
That was fun.

35:29.570 --> 35:33.050
- If I perish tonight--
- Stop. No perishables allowed.

35:33.769 --> 35:37.070
- You'll perform the rituals.
- I certainly will not.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.360
I won't receive glory if you don't.

35:40.969 --> 35:42.440
Glory you won't have.

35:42.769 --> 35:45.440
You're the only one here
who can officiate.

35:46.969 --> 35:49.320
We must get him home or he'll die.

35:49.969 --> 35:51.900
- I think I understand.
- What?

35:52.369 --> 35:55.349
- This book. It's how we do it.
- What do you mean?

35:55.969 --> 35:58.429
If he reads from it,
it'll send him back.

35:58.969 --> 36:02.300
My vision showed what happened
to that girl Fred.

36:03.170 --> 36:05.030
The portal works both ways.

36:05.570 --> 36:08.170
- And if it sends something here?
- It won't.

36:08.570 --> 36:13.309
- How can you be sure?
- I can't. I just am.

36:14.570 --> 36:16.570
Don't ask me how I know, I just know.

36:21.769 --> 36:22.929
Let's go.

36:27.769 --> 36:31.420
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan,
give me your pledge.

36:32.570 --> 36:34.739
Will you perform the rituals?

36:34.969 --> 36:37.949
I won't have to. No one's dying.

37:18.289 --> 37:21.769
- Where'd it appear?
- There. Talk about upstaging me.

37:23.690 --> 37:25.130
Cordy.

37:26.690 --> 37:28.619
Just read aloud from it.

37:31.489 --> 37:33.170
Well, that's the theory.

37:33.889 --> 37:36.980
To defeat the Drokken,
you must be a noble warrior.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.599
Well, you know.... I try.

37:42.289 --> 37:44.320
I am happy to know you.

37:45.889 --> 37:50.170
- Landok, be safe.
- Bye, Krevlornswath of Deathwok Clan.

37:51.889 --> 37:53.050
Tell my mother I--

37:53.690 --> 37:57.170
Tell her I threw myself into the
Canyons of Trelinsk.

37:57.889 --> 38:02.170
- I feel we will meet again someday.
- Oh, God, I hope not.

38:02.690 --> 38:05.429
"Klmprkthr pwlznth wrv...

38:06.289 --> 38:09.309
...blrpnkntr vrbqwptl spgr drpvln--"

38:21.889 --> 38:24.840
What say we all forget
this ever happened?

38:25.489 --> 38:28.050
I'm down with that. Wesley?

38:28.489 --> 38:30.380
Fine with me.

38:30.889 --> 38:31.829
Cordy?

38:32.090 --> 38:35.179
Cordy?

38:39.889 --> 38:40.800
Cordy!

39:05.090 --> 39:06.489
Oh, crap!

39:44.690 --> 39:45.559
Thank you,

39:46.305 --> 39:52.457
