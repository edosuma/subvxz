WEBVTT

00:04.136 --> 00:06.370
Come on, you guys.
Dinner's hot.

00:06.371 --> 00:07.939
<i>(mark)</i> what did you get?

00:07.939 --> 00:09.941
Everybody's favorite -
polish food.

00:09.942 --> 00:11.610
Oh...

00:11.611 --> 00:14.045
All right,
I love polish food.

00:14.046 --> 00:16.247
I went down
to hamtramick stan's.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.249
You were supposed
to get pizza.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.086
Anybody can get pizza.
You didn't.

00:22.287 --> 00:24.288
That's 'cause on the way
to get the pizza,

00:24.289 --> 00:26.825
I heard the call for kielbasa.

00:26.826 --> 00:30.795
You know, the last time
you ate polish food,
you were up half the night.

00:30.796 --> 00:33.798
And in the bathroom
the other half.

00:33.799 --> 00:37.502
That's because I made
a pig out of myself. This time,
I didn't order so much.

00:37.503 --> 00:40.471
These things
look great.

00:40.472 --> 00:43.942
Oh... These are great.
Brad, you oughta try
the duck blood soup.

00:43.943 --> 00:49.881
It's all right, dad. For lunch,
I had a chicken gut sandwich.

00:49.882 --> 00:52.316
I hope you're not gonna
stuff yourself again.

00:52.317 --> 00:55.620
Once you get started
on golabkis, it's hard
to put the brakes on.

00:55.621 --> 00:59.490
It's not the brakes
I'm worried about,
it's your full tank of gas.

02:03.488 --> 02:06.991
Oh. Ooh...

02:06.992 --> 02:08.359
You awake?

02:08.360 --> 02:10.862
No.

02:10.863 --> 02:15.100
I think all those
golabkis I ate

02:15.101 --> 02:18.203
Turned into
one big golabki.

02:18.204 --> 02:21.206
It's wedged between my head
and my heinie, honey.

02:24.176 --> 02:25.944
Go back to sleep.
I can't.

02:25.945 --> 02:28.780
Do we have any of those
little minty, chalky,

02:28.781 --> 02:31.049
Chewy stomach thingies?

02:31.050 --> 02:33.551
There's the liquid stuff
downstairs.

02:33.552 --> 02:36.387
Oh, would you
go get it for me?

02:36.388 --> 02:40.625
I didn't overeat.
Why should I have to get up
in the middle of the night?

02:40.626 --> 02:44.062
'cause in a second, you'll
want to be getting out of
this bed, anyway.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.831
Oh, man.

03:05.851 --> 03:08.653
<i>(man) now, when performing</i>
<i>a vasectomy,</i>

03:08.654 --> 03:11.856
<i>The first snip</i>
<i>is always critical.</i>

03:14.626 --> 03:16.828
<i>Qué buena gente.</i>

03:18.931 --> 03:21.666
<i>Bonito, el viejito.</i>

03:22.968 --> 03:27.638
<i>Y aquel chavito,</i>
<i>pues tan requetechiquito.</i>

03:27.639 --> 03:29.473
Too sad.

03:31.911 --> 03:34.045
<i>(groans)</i>

03:50.062 --> 03:52.030
<i>Does everybody know</i>
<i>what time it is?</i>

03:52.031 --> 03:53.698
<i>(audience) "tool time"!</i>

03:53.699 --> 03:56.334
<i>That's right. Binford tools</i>
<i>is proud to present</i>

03:56.335 --> 03:59.470
<i>Tim "the tool man" taylor.</i>

03:59.471 --> 04:01.739
<i>(cheering)</i>

04:09.681 --> 04:12.683
<i>Last time, I promised</i>
<i>construction-site cooking.</i>

04:12.684 --> 04:16.321
<i>That's why I invited</i>
<i>the guys at k&b construction</i>
<i>down here to the set.</i>

04:16.322 --> 04:20.558
Rock lannigan, dwayne hoover,
and pete bilker.

04:20.559 --> 04:22.393
How you doing, pete?
Hi, tim.

04:22.394 --> 04:23.962
Nice beard.

04:23.963 --> 04:27.332
Well, thank you, tim.
I grew it because of al.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.766
He's my hero.

04:33.638 --> 04:37.408
Yeah, mine too.
Rock, what have you got
for us today?

04:37.409 --> 04:40.044
Well, tim,
I'm a riveter.

04:40.045 --> 04:42.113
I work way up
on the high steel,

04:42.114 --> 04:44.815
And it makes it darn hard
to get a hot lunch up there,

04:44.816 --> 04:46.817
But I've come up with
a quick and easy way

04:46.818 --> 04:48.819
Of making a delicious
grilled-cheese sandwich.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.222
Hear my stomach growling?

04:51.223 --> 04:53.224
You're gonna
love this one, tim.

04:53.225 --> 04:55.226
The fellas call it
"cheddar a la rock."

04:55.227 --> 04:56.427
All right.

04:56.428 --> 04:58.796
I use only sharp
wisconsin cheese,

04:58.797 --> 05:01.132
Because after all,

05:01.133 --> 05:03.701
In wisconsin,
cheese is cheese.

05:03.702 --> 05:06.204
American cheese
from american cows.

05:06.205 --> 05:08.472
<i>(moos)</i>

05:08.473 --> 05:10.441
Look out!

05:10.442 --> 05:14.478
I spread on
a generous dollop
of oleo

05:14.479 --> 05:16.614
With my trowel,

05:16.615 --> 05:20.151
Then I take the cheese
and I stick it between
the bread.

05:20.152 --> 05:22.586
Good place for it.

05:22.587 --> 05:23.955
And then I...

05:26.358 --> 05:29.360
Tim, I kinda hate to give
this little secret away.

05:29.361 --> 05:31.729
Come on, rock, let it go.
It's a <i>tool time</i> crowd.

05:31.730 --> 05:32.797
<i>(grunts)</i>

05:32.798 --> 05:34.432
<i>(all grunt)</i>

05:34.433 --> 05:37.468
All right, all right.
Pete?

05:37.469 --> 05:42.941
I sprinkle on a little
oregano for flavoring,
and then I fire it up.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.009
What do you use
to heat that with?

05:45.010 --> 05:47.011
That's the secret of cooking
on the job site.

05:47.012 --> 05:49.981
I go straight for
my blowtorch.

05:49.982 --> 05:53.351
That's
no ordinary blowtorch.

05:53.352 --> 05:57.355
That's the binford 3000
turbo-ignition switch torch.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.357
Yeah, you betcha, tim.

06:01.460 --> 06:05.496
See the trick...
You gotta toast it

06:05.497 --> 06:08.132
Nice and evenly
on both sides

06:08.133 --> 06:10.935
So that you seal in that
delicious wisconsin flavor.

06:10.936 --> 06:13.604
Try that, timmy.

06:19.744 --> 06:21.479
It's hot!

06:21.480 --> 06:25.583
Might wanna let that cheese
cool down a little bit there.

06:27.953 --> 06:30.321
Oh, I remember that.

06:30.322 --> 06:34.024
That thing
tasted terrible. Ooh...

06:34.025 --> 06:36.827
<i>I'm gonna finish</i>
<i>sanding that table now.</i>

06:36.828 --> 06:39.163
We've got our belt attached
with a rough grip,

06:39.164 --> 06:41.165
And we wanna plug the thing in.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.767
You wanna be sure
the trigger switch is not
locked in the "on" position.

06:43.768 --> 06:46.004
Any idiot knows that, al.

06:51.377 --> 06:55.046
Before we get gluing,
I want to introduce
binford's new miracle glue.

06:55.047 --> 06:58.716
You might want to remind
viewers to be careful
when using this glue

06:58.717 --> 07:01.152
Because it will bond
instantly to your skin.

07:01.153 --> 07:04.588
Al, we learned
in the first grade

07:04.589 --> 07:07.025
You're not supposed
to play with glue.

07:07.026 --> 07:12.263
Well, I was just worried
about our viewers' welfare,
as well as your welfare.

07:13.598 --> 07:16.467
Al, these negative thoughts
can hurt people on the job site.

07:16.468 --> 07:18.969
I don't have
negative thoughts.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.371
You do too.
No, I don't.

07:20.372 --> 07:21.506
Do too.
Do not.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.940
Do.
Not.

07:28.013 --> 07:30.348
Maybe it would be better
if I just swept up here.

07:30.349 --> 07:33.684
Maybe it would be better
if you just swept up,
mr. Negativity.

07:33.685 --> 07:35.019
Not.
Do.

07:36.788 --> 07:40.058
You wanna set your laminate
securely on your shimmies,
front and back.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.759
Jeez...

07:49.468 --> 07:51.769
Al.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.003
Al!

07:55.006 --> 07:59.944
We'll be right back after these
messages from binford.

07:59.945 --> 08:02.180
As you can see
by our mock-up here,

08:02.181 --> 08:04.282
We've got our jack studs
in place.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.616
Now we're gonna
put our header in.

08:05.617 --> 08:08.619
So are you planning on using
a doubled-up 2 x 8?

08:08.620 --> 08:13.057
No, I'm not, bob.
I'm thinking about using
that beefy boy over there,

08:13.058 --> 08:16.127
A 4 x 8 big piece
of american doug fir.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.129
Doug fir. Ok.

08:18.130 --> 08:21.566
Folks, it's a good idea
to use your framing square
at this point in the job.

08:21.567 --> 08:25.103
You wanna make sure
this header is level.
Excellent point.

08:25.104 --> 08:28.106
There's nothing worse
than trying to hang a door
in an opening that isn't true.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.841
How true, how true.
Al, I was gonna get to that.

08:35.514 --> 08:38.816
Making their television debut
right here on <i>tool time,</i>

08:38.817 --> 08:41.152
K&b and the boys

10:06.771 --> 10:09.540
Thank you!

10:09.541 --> 10:11.509
Hi. Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

10:11.510 --> 10:13.844
As you can see,
our 1955 ranch home

10:13.845 --> 10:17.748
Needs a lot of work,
especially the roof.

10:17.749 --> 10:19.817
You wanna have
a professional examine

10:19.818 --> 10:21.885
Any weak or discolored
areas like these

10:21.886 --> 10:23.987
And make sure they're
properly attended to.

10:23.988 --> 10:27.558
For now, we'll hop over these
to a safer area.

10:31.062 --> 10:35.065
It's a little weak here.
You wanna avoid this area, too.

10:35.066 --> 10:37.067
Aah!

10:40.606 --> 10:41.939
Aah!

10:44.709 --> 10:47.945
Ow. That hurt
just looking at it again.

10:47.946 --> 10:50.515
<i>(al) I don't think</i>
<i>anyone did, tim.</i>

10:50.516 --> 10:53.684
Hey, what are you
doing up, honey?

10:53.685 --> 10:56.854
Ever since you woke me,
I couldn't get back to sleep.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.556
Oh, sorry.

10:58.557 --> 11:01.725
What happened to your hair?
It looks horrible.

11:01.726 --> 11:03.093
Well, excuse me.

11:03.094 --> 11:06.864
I didn't know I had to dress
for your upset stomach.

11:06.865 --> 11:09.333
Well, I won't look at you
that much.

11:09.334 --> 11:10.934
Thank you.

11:10.935 --> 11:14.104
I was starting to feast myself
on old <i>tool times.</i>

11:14.105 --> 11:16.541
Speaking of feast,
are there any golabkis left?

11:16.542 --> 11:20.178
If you
even think about a golabki,
I'm gonna file for a divorceki.

11:22.147 --> 11:26.050
I wouldn't worry about
other guys looking at you
with your hair like that.

11:26.051 --> 11:28.118
Will you watch some of these
<i>tool times</i> with me?

11:28.119 --> 11:31.922
Well, I can't get back to sleep
any other way.

11:39.598 --> 11:41.765
<i>In order to get a new floor,</i>
<i>we lift off the old floor.</i>

11:41.766 --> 11:45.570
That's right.
And for that we can use
a simple basic scraper.

11:45.571 --> 11:47.605
But that wouldn't be fun.
Let's use the dry-ice method.

11:47.606 --> 11:50.241
Put dry ice down, and it lifts
asphalt tiles right up.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.244
Actually, tim, uh...

11:53.245 --> 11:56.681
Using dry ice, you'd need
an awful lot of dry ice
for that to work.

11:56.682 --> 11:59.783
For once, al,
you're totally correct.

11:59.784 --> 12:02.620
So what we'll do is,
we'll be using the...

12:02.621 --> 12:04.021
<i>(engine starts)</i>

12:04.022 --> 12:06.524
...The simple
basic scraper.

12:06.525 --> 12:10.027
You can pick this up
at just about any
hardware store.

12:27.679 --> 12:33.384
We'll be right back
after these messages
from binford tools.

12:33.385 --> 12:36.320
Boy, there's a sport
with more power. Oh-oh.

12:36.321 --> 12:38.723
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.324
That's right, tim.

12:40.325 --> 12:43.961
But the secret
is to channel that power
through focus and concentration.

12:43.962 --> 12:45.529
Two things I excel at.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.999
Well, that and driving yourself
to the hospital while bleeding.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.974
Are you saying
I couldn't break that board
with my head?

12:56.975 --> 13:00.444
Well, tim,
he says it takes focus
and concentration.

13:02.013 --> 13:04.915
I think we all know
which one of us has that.

13:09.554 --> 13:11.955
You think you can
break this board
with your head?

13:11.956 --> 13:13.557
Yes, I do.
Oh, really?

13:13.558 --> 13:17.094
I don't think it's such
a good idea, al.
My show here, ok?

13:18.463 --> 13:20.798
You're up to the challenge,
right, al?

13:20.799 --> 13:22.300
It's all right.

13:31.743 --> 13:32.810
Hai!

13:32.811 --> 13:35.680
<i>(cheering)</i>

13:41.219 --> 13:45.055
Tim, I don't think
you should try this.
Hey, quiet, quiet, please.

13:45.056 --> 13:47.191
One thing you...
You've said enough.

13:47.192 --> 13:50.027
You should know...
It's my show.
I can do this.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.537
Hyah, godzilla!

14:03.274 --> 14:07.077
I was gonna say
I have studied karate,
tim.

14:07.078 --> 14:09.947
Buford tools...
W-w... Messages.
We have 'em.

14:09.948 --> 14:11.949
We'll be right back.

14:16.321 --> 14:19.122
Hi. Welcome to
this special edition
of <i>tool time.</i>

14:19.123 --> 14:22.660
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor,
and you know my assistant al.

14:22.661 --> 14:26.930
We're here at beautiful
memorial park, ready for
the big race with bob vila.

14:26.931 --> 14:29.967
I've got this helmet cam,
so you'll see exactly
what I see.

14:29.968 --> 14:32.470
Hey, bob, who do you think
is gonna win the race?

14:32.471 --> 14:35.406
It's for charity.
The real winners
are the children.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.342
Of course they are, bob.
The winners are the kids.

14:38.343 --> 14:43.381
In second place, me.
In a distant third, bob.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.416
Start your engines.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.132
Ready?

15:02.133 --> 15:03.768
One,

15:03.769 --> 15:05.269
Two, three!

15:10.074 --> 15:12.743
Nice mower, bob.
Thanks, tim.

15:12.744 --> 15:15.679
I'd love to sit and chat,
but I gotta run.

15:17.482 --> 15:20.017
Oh, boy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:20.018 --> 15:22.620
Look out, buddy. Look out!
Look out! Look out!

15:28.427 --> 15:30.728
Aah!

15:34.499 --> 15:36.700
Aah!

15:40.505 --> 15:42.172
Aah!

15:46.645 --> 15:50.614
As you can see, I've got
three samples of wood
on the workbench.

15:50.615 --> 15:52.616
I'll hand them to al
one at a time.

15:52.617 --> 15:56.353
He claims he can tell us
what type of wood it is
just by smelling it.

15:56.354 --> 15:58.422
We shall see.

15:58.423 --> 16:02.059
Al borland,
name that wood.

16:04.696 --> 16:06.931
Tim, that's hickory.

16:14.005 --> 16:16.841
Can you believe it, ladies?
This man's single.

16:19.310 --> 16:24.214
Second sample.
Al borland, name that wood.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.018
Cedar.
Hah!

16:28.019 --> 16:30.454
Wait...

16:33.391 --> 16:35.125
Western red cedar.

16:42.934 --> 16:44.969
You almost
messed that one up, al.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.705
Well, I'm fighting off
a cold, tim.

16:49.107 --> 16:51.274
Well, this next sample...

16:53.845 --> 16:57.147
...Should be a little bit
more difficult to discern, al.

16:57.148 --> 17:01.118
You might have to take
a big old whiff of this thing
to figure out what it is.

17:01.119 --> 17:04.054
Well, I'm up to
the challenge, tim.

17:04.055 --> 17:06.924
I certainly hope so, al.

17:09.227 --> 17:12.530
Al borland,
name that wood.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.835
Oh!

17:19.738 --> 17:25.308
Well, it's... It's a hardwood
from the pacific northwest,
and...

17:25.309 --> 17:26.877
Uhh.

17:29.748 --> 17:35.619
Well, this particular piece
seems to have some type
of a fungus.

17:39.691 --> 17:42.259
Uh, well, uh, uh...

17:42.260 --> 17:45.295
Uhh. Let me
try this again.

17:50.334 --> 17:52.570
Ohh!

17:54.739 --> 17:56.740
I also have a helpful
household hint.

17:56.741 --> 17:58.742
I'm going to show
the audience something

17:58.743 --> 18:01.011
You don't ordinarily do
with a potato.

18:01.012 --> 18:03.647
Keep the kids
away from the tv set.
Tim.

18:05.584 --> 18:09.086
Here's a safe way
to take a broken bulb
from its socket.

18:09.087 --> 18:13.057
You simply take a cut potato,
jam it into the socket,
twist...

18:13.058 --> 18:15.258
And in minutes, you have
thousands of curly fries.

18:15.259 --> 18:17.795
A wonderful snack
for tv time, movies...
Tim. Tim!

18:17.796 --> 18:22.700
I doubted the razor,
but I gave it a chance.
Please do not mock my potato.

18:24.469 --> 18:28.171
You say potato,
I say stupid.

18:28.172 --> 18:32.509
Tim, this'll work. You twist
and pull the broken bulb
right out of the socket.

18:32.510 --> 18:35.079
But first you must...
Jam it in the light.

18:42.453 --> 18:43.854
...Unplug the lamp.

18:45.857 --> 18:49.059
I'd like to introduce you
to binford's small line
of industrial magnets.

18:49.060 --> 18:54.564
The minimag 100
is perfect for picking up
screws and nails.

18:54.565 --> 18:58.235
It can pick up small tools
that have carelessly been
dropped behind the workbench,

18:58.236 --> 19:00.638
Perhaps the fault
of a coworker.

19:03.842 --> 19:06.777
And the minimag 2000.

19:06.778 --> 19:11.715
Small but powerful. 10 pounds
will pick up 400 pounds.

19:11.716 --> 19:14.918
This would suck the tin man
right through a keyhole.

19:14.919 --> 19:17.688
Well, it was designed
to pick up sheet metal,

19:17.689 --> 19:20.290
So you want to keep it
pointed... Tim.

19:23.461 --> 19:25.529
No, no, just slide it.

19:25.530 --> 19:26.964
Slide it down.

19:30.168 --> 19:31.168
Tim.

19:35.173 --> 19:37.107
Pretty powerful little thing,
isn't it?

19:37.108 --> 19:39.176
<i>(feedback)</i>

19:43.381 --> 19:45.015
Marv, pull it back!
Marv!

19:51.489 --> 19:54.792
We'll be right back after
these messages from binford.

19:57.862 --> 19:59.797
Wait a minute.

19:59.798 --> 20:04.568
Get this rope here,
attach it here to my biner,

20:04.569 --> 20:07.504
Then you can head down
towards that porta-potty
right down there.

20:07.505 --> 20:12.176
Tim, be careful.
I don't know, al, I... Oh!

20:12.177 --> 20:14.544
Aah!

20:20.518 --> 20:22.686
<i>(al) tim!</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>

20:22.687 --> 20:26.757
Th - are you awake?

20:26.758 --> 20:28.525
Jill?

20:28.526 --> 20:32.062
<i>(tim) can somebody</i>
<i>send me a magazine?</i>

20:32.063 --> 20:33.997
Uh, jill?

20:38.302 --> 20:41.238
I'm just gonna make myself
a little kielbasa omelet,

20:41.239 --> 20:43.506
With a hint of golabki.

20:49.914 --> 20:51.448
Oh.

20:51.449 --> 20:54.952
This is a good part.
This is great stuff.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.788
<i>To john q. Primitive man,</i>
<i>this was his source of fire.</i>

20:57.789 --> 21:01.058
They were trying to get a spark
to get the kindling moving.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.560
You should be careful
because you could
start a fire.

21:03.561 --> 21:07.231
Like I'm really gonna
start a fire.
Well, that's the... Tim.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.432
Al, al, al...
Tim, you're on fire.

21:11.535 --> 21:13.403
Indeed I am, al.

21:13.404 --> 21:16.173
I've done this to teach
the kids out there
an important lesson.

21:16.174 --> 21:19.576
Don't play with sticks.
They can put your eye out
or ignite your forearm.

21:19.577 --> 21:21.611
Al, could you
help me out here?

21:24.949 --> 21:29.920
I think we should
bid john farewell
in the <i>tool time</i> fashion -

21:29.921 --> 21:31.688
A little tribute
to john binford

21:31.689 --> 21:36.126
With a binford
21-nailgun salute.

21:41.766 --> 21:44.902
Do you think this isn't
a little dangerous, tim?

21:44.903 --> 21:47.271
No, wait. Warren,
the protective drop cloth,
please.

21:48.773 --> 21:49.940
Have you tried this?

21:49.941 --> 21:52.609
The drop cloth will collect
all of the nails.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.845
Well, you've tried this?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.218
Klaus,
some music, please.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.353
<i>(♪ plays "taps")</i>

22:07.358 --> 22:08.992
So long, johnny.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.273
Look, tim,
just be careful.

22:23.274 --> 22:25.742
Tim.

22:25.743 --> 22:27.510
<i>(music trails off)</i>

22:38.723 --> 22:40.824
Hey, that's all
of our show today.

22:40.825 --> 22:43.961
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor.
I gotta get out of here.

22:45.429 --> 22:49.066
Today, al and I
will be talking about fencing.

22:49.067 --> 22:53.570
In order to do that,
I'm gonna need
my dueling dowel. Heidi?

22:53.571 --> 22:55.405
Here you go, tim.

22:55.406 --> 22:58.108
Thanks, heidi.
You're welcome.

23:01.246 --> 23:04.581
En garde, big fella.
Come on, flannel man.
Tim.

23:04.582 --> 23:06.649
Tim. Tim.

23:06.650 --> 23:08.085
He's scared.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.088
This is not the type of fencing
we're talking about.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.490
Today, we'll be talking
about the classic...

23:40.385 --> 23:42.485
To show some of the advantages
of soundproofing,

23:42.486 --> 23:45.289
The crew and I got here early
and constructed a special room.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.557
Heidi, my room, please.

23:49.127 --> 23:52.930
This room will not only
protect you from the elements,
keep you warm,

23:52.931 --> 23:54.932
But it's also
totally soundproof.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.634
Here you go, tim.
Thank you, heidi.

24:00.438 --> 24:02.705
Watch this. Can't hear a word.
It's so good.

24:02.706 --> 24:04.741
Talking like this,
you walk in.

24:04.742 --> 24:08.178
Hi, everybody.
It's great to be here.
My name's tim "the tool..."

24:08.179 --> 24:09.212
<i>(mouths)</i>

24:22.226 --> 24:24.962
Aah!

24:24.963 --> 24:26.997
<i>(applause)</i>

24:33.737 --> 24:36.306
That is truly amazing.
We did not hear a sound.

24:36.307 --> 24:38.442
No, that's how it was designed.
You gotta try it.

24:38.443 --> 24:41.211
Let yourself go.
It's great. Yeah.

24:45.116 --> 24:48.785
Tim, can you hear me?
<i>(mouths)</i>

24:48.786 --> 24:50.854
You can't hear me?

24:50.855 --> 24:55.725
In that case,
I should be the host
of this show.

24:55.726 --> 24:59.062
And another thing, that's
a stupid haircut you have.

24:59.063 --> 25:01.365
And another thing...

25:27.825 --> 25:30.327
I can hear you.

25:35.933 --> 25:37.867
Think about that.

25:45.076 --> 25:47.877
Major general borland.

25:50.014 --> 25:52.315
Give a big <i>tool time</i> welcome
to the astronauts,

25:52.316 --> 25:55.485
The crew of the <i>endeavour</i>
space shuttle.

25:55.486 --> 25:57.087
<i>(cheering)</i>

26:06.864 --> 26:09.533
Let's meet mission commander
dick covey.

26:09.534 --> 26:12.502
How you doing, sir?
Very good, tim.

26:13.938 --> 26:16.139
Well, dick supervised
the entire servicing

26:16.140 --> 26:18.175
Of the hubble space telescope.

26:18.176 --> 26:21.211
What's it like
working with tools
in outer space?

26:21.212 --> 26:24.013
Well, tim, it's a lot like
using tools here on earth,

26:24.014 --> 26:26.049
Except there's no gravity,
so you don't have to worry

26:26.050 --> 26:28.918
About dropping a tool
on your foot.

26:32.856 --> 26:36.560
Sounds like the perfect
working environment
for you, tim.

26:38.829 --> 26:40.564
He's very funny.

26:40.565 --> 26:44.701
Yeah. A regular
astro-nut.

26:44.702 --> 26:47.404
Tim, it's pronounced
astro-naut.

26:47.405 --> 26:50.440
Yeah, I know.
That was a little joke.

26:50.441 --> 26:53.610
Oh, sorry.
I had no idea.

26:58.816 --> 27:01.284
Wow! Tools from space.

27:01.285 --> 27:04.454
What I wouldn't give to have
one of these on my shop wall.

27:04.455 --> 27:07.357
That's a 3/8-inch drive
mctether ratchet.

27:07.358 --> 27:10.527
They use this for playing
mctetherball out there.

27:15.266 --> 27:16.799
And next, we have a...

27:16.800 --> 27:20.937
Hey, where's my power tool
with the adjustable extension?

27:25.276 --> 27:27.310
You guys probably forgot
to bring it.

27:27.311 --> 27:29.679
No, I saw you
working with it earlier.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.748
I wasn't working with it.
Yes, you were.

27:31.749 --> 27:35.752
Tim, is this
what you're looking for?
Oh, that!

27:35.753 --> 27:39.489
Heidi, where'd you find that?
Doesn't matter where
she found it.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.691
It was in tim's locker.

27:44.962 --> 27:48.465
<i>(high-pitched)</i>
well, I... See, I...

27:48.466 --> 27:51.801

27:51.802 --> 27:54.137
Whoo.

27:54.138 --> 27:56.939
Taylor, we're gonna
need this back too.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.175
How did that
get in there?
