Hi. Is there anything
I can do for you?

01:21.281 --> 01:22.816
No, I don't think so.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.825
Cousin, this is
the greatest day of my life!

01:31.858 --> 01:33.560
Even greater than
the day I bought

01:33.594 --> 01:35.261
my first pair of

01:42.803 --> 01:45.438
Where is this restaurant?

01:45.471 --> 01:47.541
I had lunch
with Carol Mosley.

on the other side of the class.

All the way to the pawnshop.

‐ Hey, give me that.
‐ No.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.114
Balki, give me that pin.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.482
I don't think so.

13:39.620 --> 13:42.288
I just wanna see it,
I've heard so much about it.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.857
I just mentioned it
for the first time.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.260
Well, yes, that's when
I heard so much about it.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.130
May I see it, please?

13:51.297 --> 13:52.365
I'll give it right back.

13:53.634 --> 13:55.035
Do you promise?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.469
I promise.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.476
Are you crazy?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.410
Give me that.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.550
You're gonna give a family
heirloom to that barracuda?

14:11.985 --> 14:13.186
You tricked Balki.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.487
You're darn right
I tricked Balki.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.622
Give me nana's pin.

14:15.656 --> 14:17.390
No, I won't give you
nana's pin.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.292
I'm gonna put it in
a safe deposit box

14:19.325 --> 14:21.061

I can't stop you from
asking Carol to go steady

14:45.151 --> 14:47.588
but just let me
keep the pin for a day.

14:47.621 --> 14:50.090
If you ask her to go steady
and she says yes

14:50.123 --> 14:51.357
then I'll give you back the pin

14:51.391 --> 14:54.227
with‐with my apologies
and my blessings.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.963
Cousin, she loves me.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.666
I don't know why
you can't believe that.

14:59.700 --> 15:03.003
I don't need the pin,
and I don't need your apologies.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.505
I want your blessing.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.342
Honest to God, I hope
I am wrong about Carol.

15:10.977 --> 15:11.978
[mellow music]

15:24.490 --> 15:27.027
Are you sure this woman is
going to hurt Balki that badly?

Am I sure?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.498
I've been there.

15:32.533 --> 15:33.667
When he comes through that door

15:33.700 --> 15:36.369
he'll be a shell
of his former self.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.305
Oh, he'll pretend everything's
alright while you're here.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.241
But as soon as you leave

15:41.274 --> 15:45.411
he'll open up, pour his poor,
pitiful heart out.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.148
I'll comfort him.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.517
I've got some tissues.

15:50.551 --> 15:52.586
The ice cream
will cheer him up.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.654
A little.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.191
And then he'll sleep
a dreamless sleep

15:58.224 --> 15:59.593
with his arms around Dimitri.

Gosh! You're a great friend.

was going to happen.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.404
‐ And she said?
‐ Yep.

You asked Carol Mosley, the same
girl that was here two weeks ago

17:22.142 --> 17:24.077
to go steady with you,
and she said yes?

17:24.109 --> 17:25.646
You ain't just
whistling Dixie cups.

This was the last night
of class?

‐ School is over?
‐ Uh‐huh.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.755
Now, is there something you'd
like to crawl over here and say?

17:37.558 --> 17:39.726
Well, Balki, what can I say?

17:39.760 --> 17:45.231
I‐I‐I made a big, big
mistake. I am so sorry.

17:45.265 --> 17:49.202
Here, please give this
to Carol with my blessing.

have taken it to begin with.

her head to the side

to go steady and said

18:03.584 --> 18:08.454
"You and me go steady?
That's cute."

18:08.488 --> 18:11.792
And then she was so happy
that she burst out laughing.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.637
Balki, exactly
how did she laugh?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.473

18:40.554 --> 18:42.756

the second one

18:42.789 --> 18:45.926
but she don't point.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.661
Why do ask?

18:47.694 --> 18:49.530
After you asked her to go steady

18:49.563 --> 18:50.831
did you make any plans
for the future?

18:50.864 --> 18:53.466
Oh, it's all we
could talk about.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.569
We are both bursting with joy.

18:55.602 --> 19:00.674
She tell me that she will be
very busy looking for a job

19:00.707 --> 19:03.309
and also for
a new apartment

19:03.343 --> 19:05.646
because she's moving out of the
building called Jack's Place.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.819
Did she say something like

19:12.853 --> 19:15.488
she was too busy
to get together real soon?

19:15.522 --> 19:19.325
Yes, and I told
her I understand.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.762
Did she also say she was
gonna be getting a new phone

19:21.795 --> 19:24.731
and she'd call you as soon
as she had her new number?

19:24.765 --> 19:27.300
Get out of the city!
You were listening.

Oh, boy!

19:44.017 --> 19:46.720
...I'm afraid this
is really gonna hurt.

19:50.423 --> 19:54.260
When a woman says
she's too busy

19:54.294 --> 19:57.564
that's her way
of putting you off.

19:57.598 --> 20:00.300
And when she says
she's getting a new phone

20:00.333 --> 20:02.302
she has no intention
of giving you the number.

20:06.439 --> 20:10.376
And Jack's Place is
not the name of a building.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.846
It's Jack's place.

20:14.915 --> 20:17.250
But, cousin, she don't
say any of those things.

20:17.283 --> 20:20.687
Not in those words,
but that's what she meant.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.959
Why are you doing this again?

20:25.992 --> 20:28.829
Why can't you
just be happy for me?

20:28.862 --> 20:30.296
What you saying is no true.

20:32.566 --> 20:35.836
Balki, if you don't believe me,
then just call her yourself.

to Carol, please.

probably named Jack.
