WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.702
How do you call yourselves
a sheet music store

00:03.704 --> 00:05.971
If you don't have
the soundtrack of<i> smash?</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:09.108
Ugh, i know, it's like
a show choir hate crime.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.412
Hi, blaine.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.048
And dave.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.716
Don't tell me
that we have to figure out

00:17.718 --> 00:18.884
Alternating sheet music days.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.386
No. No, of course not.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.887
It's fine.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.522
So, uh, i've been helping
blaine put together

00:23.524 --> 00:25.391
His warblers song list.
Oh...

00:25.393 --> 00:28.560
But it's just like pulling teeth
to get this guy off broadway.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.896
Or even off off-broadway, if
you know what i mean, right?

00:30.898 --> 00:32.831
(forced chuckling)

00:32.833 --> 00:34.800
Um, it's good
to see you, kurt.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.269
(carole king's
"it's too late" begins)

00:43.677 --> 00:48.414
¶ stayed in bed all morning
just to pass the time ¶

00:48.416 --> 00:50.149
¶ there's something wrong here ¶

00:50.151 --> 00:53.052
¶ there can be no denying ¶

00:53.054 --> 00:55.020
¶ one of us is changing ¶

00:55.022 --> 00:59.291
¶ or maybe we've just
stopped trying ¶

01:01.328 --> 01:03.862
¶ and it's too late, baby ¶

01:03.864 --> 01:06.065
¶ now it's too late ¶

01:06.067 --> 01:11.070
¶ though we really did try
to make it ¶

01:11.072 --> 01:14.440
¶ something inside has died ¶

01:14.442 --> 01:16.842
¶ and i can't hide it ¶

01:16.844 --> 01:19.545
¶ i just can't fake it ¶

01:19.547 --> 01:21.680
¶ oh, no, no ¶

01:21.682 --> 01:22.781
¶ no, no... ¶

01:22.783 --> 01:23.882
¶ oh, no... ¶

01:23.884 --> 01:26.118
¶ no, no ¶

01:29.523 --> 01:33.225
¶ it used to be so easy
living here with you ¶

01:33.227 --> 01:34.426
¶ here with you ¶

01:34.428 --> 01:35.894
¶ you were light and breezy ¶

01:35.896 --> 01:38.063
¶ and i knew just what to do ¶

01:38.065 --> 01:40.365
¶ now you look so unhappy ¶

01:40.367 --> 01:43.368
¶ and i feel like a fool ¶

01:43.370 --> 01:47.573
¶ i feel like a fool ¶

01:47.575 --> 01:49.741
¶ and it's too late, baby ¶

01:49.743 --> 01:51.977
¶ now it's too late ¶

01:51.979 --> 01:57.049
¶ though we really did try
to make it ¶

01:57.051 --> 02:00.085
¶ something inside has died ¶

02:00.087 --> 02:02.254
¶ and i can't hide it ¶

02:02.256 --> 02:04.656
¶ i just can't fake it ¶

02:04.658 --> 02:07.493
¶ oh, no, no ¶

02:07.495 --> 02:10.729
¶ no, no, no ¶

02:14.735 --> 02:17.236
¶ na-na-na-na-na-na ¶

02:17.238 --> 02:20.139
¶ na, na, na, na, na ¶

02:22.776 --> 02:26.345
¶ oh, it's too late ¶

02:26.347 --> 02:30.516
¶ baby, it's too late ¶

02:30.518 --> 02:32.518
¶ now, darling ¶

02:32.520 --> 02:37.389
¶ it's too late. ¶

02:43.531 --> 02:44.930
(school bell ringing)

02:44.932 --> 02:47.366
I ran into blaine and
karofsky last night.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.701
Then i spent the rest of
the night having a fantasy

02:49.703 --> 02:51.436
About singing "it's too
late" all over town.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.437
Oh, no.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.339
Hey.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.209
Why don't we use carole king's
seminal break-up album<i> tapestry</i>

02:57.211 --> 02:58.610
As this week's lesson?

02:58.612 --> 02:59.845
Yeah, it's brilliant,
but, i mean,

02:59.847 --> 03:01.346
It's sort of a downer,
don't you think?

03:01.348 --> 03:02.814
If we're gonna do
a break-up album,

03:02.816 --> 03:04.816
Then it has to be
<i>jagged little pill,</i>

03:04.818 --> 03:06.985
'cause it's modern
and edgy and angry.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.487
And isn't that
the kind of energy

03:08.489 --> 03:10.055
That we want these
new kids expressing?

03:10.057 --> 03:12.024
Yeah, but i bet none of
these kids have even heard

03:12.026 --> 03:13.859
Of<i> tapestry,</i> and
that's just wrong.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.161
And mr. Shue was a little
obsessed with rap and journey,

03:16.163 --> 03:17.896
But at least we
all left glee club

03:17.898 --> 03:19.865
With a better understanding
and appreciation

03:19.867 --> 03:21.833
Of all kinds of music.
You know?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.803
It's our job to educate as well
as win competitions, you know?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.338
Maybe it was easier
for mr. Shue

03:26.340 --> 03:28.307
'cause he didn't have
a partner to answer to.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.641
I...

03:29.643 --> 03:31.043
I'm just, you know,
getting worried

03:31.045 --> 03:32.477
About this
co-teaching thing.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.379
I don't want us
to start hating each other.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.348
Wait, why don't we
do both albums?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.350
We'll make it
a mash-up week.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.986
Think about it, uh,<i> jagged</i>
<i>little pill</i> and<i> tapestry.</i>

03:40.988 --> 03:43.989
Two great albums written by
great singer-songwriters.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.524
That's brilliant because
then we can educate them

03:45.526 --> 03:47.159
And get them fired up
at the same time.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.094
We're so good!
Yes, on fire,
rachel, fire!

03:49.096 --> 03:50.529
You and me, together.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.731
(school bell ringing)

03:53.534 --> 03:54.900
Sorry i'm late.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.769
I think i got some
bad sushi last night.

03:57.771 --> 04:01.607
I seriously did not get
off the pot until about...

04:01.609 --> 04:04.343
15 minutes ago.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.911
So, uh, how was practice?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.579
Uh, you know, amazing, yeah.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.414
Only two guys passed out
from dehydration.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.683
Well, you can't
criticize the results.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.851
The guys love you.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.354
They work hard for you.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.624
Like i say, miracle whip
works fine on a burger, but...

04:18.626 --> 04:20.726
Both: You can't use it
to skin a cat.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.060
Thanks, coach, yeah.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.795
Um, no, i'm having
the time of my life here.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.265
I mean, if you asked me what
my dream was, like, right now,

04:26.267 --> 04:28.367
Besides like, having one of
those, like, giant talking m&m's

04:28.369 --> 04:29.601
And, uh, making it my pet...

04:29.603 --> 04:30.969
(chuckles)
it would probably be

04:30.971 --> 04:33.038
To take over your job
when you retire.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.273
It's, like, my ultimate fantasy.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.974
You could do it, too.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.543
You've got the gift, sam.
That's why i've been

04:38.545 --> 04:41.213
Entrusting you in running
practice couple days a week.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.381
Oh, hey, um...

04:42.383 --> 04:43.782
Are you, uh...

04:43.784 --> 04:45.117
Are you... Are you okay?

04:45.119 --> 04:46.918
What?
I-i mean,
like i said,

04:46.920 --> 04:49.554
I-i'm super grateful, um...
But, frankly,

04:49.556 --> 04:51.556
Everybody thinks it's
kind of suspicious for you

04:51.558 --> 04:53.158
To skip out of practice at all.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.993
Well, you tell 'em to mind
their own damn business!

04:54.995 --> 04:56.995
Whoa, uh, nobody's accusing you
of anything.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.830
I... And definitely not me.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.999
Honestly, i'm, you know,
i'm just...

05:01.001 --> 05:02.100
I'm worried about you.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.503
It-it's my knee.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.838
Looks like i'm gonna have
to have it replaced again.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.974
And i'll probably have to
take off a couple weeks.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.942
Is that all?
God, okay, i was worried

05:10.944 --> 05:12.477
It was something more serious.
I mean, like...

05:12.479 --> 05:13.945
Well, that explains
the extra leg hair.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.347
It must hurt to shave.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.582
I've been trying to
keep it hush-hush.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.985
You know, i feel like
the-the team needs to see me

05:19.987 --> 05:21.186
As, like, iron shannon,

05:21.188 --> 05:23.689
You know, this
invincible titan.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.390
Hey, coach... Es.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.795
Uh... You got a second to talk
about the starters for friday?

05:29.797 --> 05:32.264
I'll post it friday
morning, same as always.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.332
I want a shot
at quarterback.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.766
You're my best receiver.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.601
I've been taking snaps
in practice for weeks.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.869
I came in
the last four minutes

05:37.871 --> 05:39.037
Of the game against central

05:39.039 --> 05:40.205
And threw for four first downs.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.374
And no touchdowns.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.842
And you know why?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.644
Because you didn't have you
to throw to.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.979
I told you
this 50 times.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.015
You take fred flintstone
off the brontosaurus,

05:50.017 --> 05:53.218
All he is, is wilma with
a set of man-plumbs.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.586
Conversation over.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.025
Look, dude, man.
Tough break, buddy, okay?

06:00.027 --> 06:02.494
I think you're like a majestic
knight riding a horse.

06:02.496 --> 06:05.564
If it were up to me,
i'd give you a shot.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.334
(school bell ringing)

06:09.336 --> 06:11.370
Okay, why don't i start it
with the title,

06:11.372 --> 06:13.171
And then you can just
segue into the theme.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.673
Or i could start
with the title,

06:14.675 --> 06:15.741
And then we could both
segue into the theme.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.676
Welcome, everyone,

06:17.678 --> 06:19.978
To our very first
glee club rehearsal.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.817
First, i would like to welcome
back our distinguished alumni

06:25.819 --> 06:28.253
Who have so graciously agreed
to stay an extra week.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.755
So, thank you, thank you,
thank you.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.723
Yeah, how exactly are you guys
doing that?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.392
Oh, i can bend time
and space with my mind.

06:33.394 --> 06:36.194
Okay, so, as you very
well have heard,

06:36.196 --> 06:38.497
The glee club has a grand
and glorious tradition

06:38.499 --> 06:40.065
Of starting each
week with a lesson

06:40.067 --> 06:43.034
Where we explore every
musical genre under the sun.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.836
But mostly katy perry
and show tunes.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.773
Not this week. Rachel and i
are extremely excited

06:47.775 --> 06:49.508
To kick off this week's
lesson with our...

06:49.510 --> 06:53.845
First musical lesson,
"jagged little tapestry."

06:53.847 --> 06:56.715
Oh, look, finally some songs
about rachel's hair extensions.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.251
Now, as you can clearly see,
we've combined the titles

06:59.253 --> 07:01.353
Of these two
iconic albums...

07:01.355 --> 07:03.889
Alanis morissette's
<i>jagged little pill.</i>

07:03.891 --> 07:07.793
Which is celebrating its
20th-year anniversary.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.461
And carole king's
<i>tapestry.</i>

07:09.463 --> 07:11.396
That-that's my favorite.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.199
So these two iconic
albums are sort of

07:14.201 --> 07:15.534
Like chocolate and
peanut butter.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.035
Both...
Or peanut butter
and jelly.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.738
Okay, they're both different
but amazing.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.306
You know, you could say
that they're sort of

07:21.308 --> 07:22.908
Like the reese's
pieces of music.
Mm-hmm.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.876
Right?
Or, if you don't
like reese's pieces,

07:24.878 --> 07:27.779
You could name another
candy of your choice.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.951
Okay, kurt, why
don't you now...

07:32.953 --> 07:34.653
Well-well, carole king's
<i>tapestry</i> is-is...

07:34.655 --> 07:36.421
You know,
it's easy and informal,

07:36.423 --> 07:38.623
Like you're getting a cup
of coffee with an old friend.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.059
Both:
Team carole.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.127
Good choice.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.995
Okay, and alanis
is different.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.897
You know, she's edgy
and dark...
Angry.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.833
Team alanis.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.069
Yeah, and this is why we wanted
it to be your first lesson.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.337
Because, like
alanis and carole,

07:52.339 --> 07:53.672
You can look at every situation

07:53.674 --> 07:55.574
From two different
points of view, you know?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.609
It's about
combining...
I think what kurt
is trying to say is

07:57.611 --> 07:59.744
That it's about working together
and using this lesson

07:59.746 --> 08:01.012
To grow as a team.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.581
I'm sorry, i'm confused.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.816
What is it exactly
you want us to do?

08:04.818 --> 08:07.452
Just sit and smile like
i did for three years.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.287
So, our weekly lesson
is to find a partner

08:09.289 --> 08:11.456
That has a different style
than you and work together

08:11.458 --> 08:14.259
To mash up an alanis
and a carole song.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.527
Kurt and i will demonstrate...

08:15.529 --> 08:17.963
Probably tomorrow?
What? We...

08:17.965 --> 08:20.198
(quietly):
Let me tell you something--
why do you keep interrupting me?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.334
You're interrupting me,
and you're confusing them.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.935
You're confusing the
hell out of them.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.271
Santana: Okay, or how about
since you and porcelain

08:26.273 --> 08:28.273
Obviously have some issues
to iron out,

08:28.275 --> 08:30.075
Brittany and i will go first.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.177
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.678
That'd be great.
(school bell ringing)

08:33.680 --> 08:34.946
Quinn, can i talk
to you for a sec?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.381
Artie told me
that you said

08:36.383 --> 08:37.716
That brown was not
an ivy league school.

08:37.718 --> 08:38.984
That's not what i said.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.852
I said it's barely
an ivy league school.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.153
Becky.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.688
(groans)

08:43.690 --> 08:44.890
I thought you were in college.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.191
I am, idiot.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.360
I came back because
i'm in trouble.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.494
I need help.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.629
I met a guy
named darrell,

08:50.631 --> 08:53.164
And now he's my boyfriend.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.966
And i'm madly
in love.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.067
Well, that's amazing.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.369
Shut up! I know!

08:57.371 --> 08:58.570
I brought him home

08:58.572 --> 09:01.206
To lima
so he can meet my parents.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.240
Okay, so what's the problem?

09:02.242 --> 09:04.142
Bitch! The problem is

09:04.144 --> 09:05.310
That i lied to him.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.978
I told darrell
that i was

09:06.980 --> 09:09.981
The president of every club
at school.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.484
¶ ¶

09:20.661 --> 09:23.428
Becky, that's
an insane web of lies.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.829
I know, whore.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.865
But that's not
the worst part.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.034
I told him
that i was in glee club.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.202
Wait, why would you
tell him that?

09:31.204 --> 09:33.438
Because he was in glee club
in high school,

09:33.440 --> 09:36.408
And i want to impress him
by my singing voice.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.843
You got to let me sing
at the glee club

09:38.845 --> 09:40.946
When darrell comes
to school tomorrow.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.180
Becky, we will do

09:42.182 --> 09:43.615
Whatever it takes to help you.

09:43.617 --> 09:44.983
Thanks, kitty.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.920
(sighs)
you know, i am pretty sure

09:48.922 --> 09:51.890
That our fish ancestors
crawled out of the ooze

09:51.892 --> 09:53.892
And got legs just
to be able to scissor.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.460
Well, actually,

09:55.462 --> 09:57.295
Scissoring was invented
by the ancient egyptians,

09:57.297 --> 09:59.431
Which is weird because actual
scissors weren't invented

09:59.433 --> 10:01.733
For many centuries
after that. True story.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.401
(chuckles)
you know,

10:03.403 --> 10:05.370
I have to say,
i'm kind of really digging this

10:05.372 --> 10:07.472
Back-to-the-future
for glee club.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.808
If for no other reason
than to mess

10:09.810 --> 10:12.310
With berry and her sad gay.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.614
But i have
the perfect mash-up idea

10:15.616 --> 10:17.115
For us to perform
this week.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.917
So do i. Okay, you go first.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.552
Three, two, one.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.320
"i feel the earth move"
and "hand in my pocket."

10:22.322 --> 10:23.421
"you oughta know."

10:23.423 --> 10:24.723
No, see, you're supposed to do

10:24.725 --> 10:26.591
A song from each album.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.760
Okay, but i refuse to be
restrained by the laws of man.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.629
I like to think
outside of the box.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.263
No, listen. Okay.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.567
Aren't we here to help
the glee club get back on top?

10:35.569 --> 10:37.235
And don't you think
that teaching the power

10:37.237 --> 10:39.604
Of a mash-up would
totally contribute to that?

10:39.606 --> 10:41.806
Okay, i may be a genius, but...

10:41.808 --> 10:45.377
How can i argue with the logic
of your giant, generous heart?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.746
Come here.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.917
Ugh, we are so awesomely
in love.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.820
I would totally hate us
if i didn't know us.
I was thinking.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.690
I think that you and i should
live in new york together.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.292
You know? I-i want to go back
to college-- nyu

11:01.294 --> 11:03.361
Or columbia--
and you can just go...

11:03.363 --> 11:05.964
Wherever i get in, genius.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.866
How much fun would it be

11:07.868 --> 11:09.134
To be back in school
together again?

11:09.136 --> 11:10.101
(sighs) it'd be amazing!

11:10.103 --> 11:11.836
I love you, britt.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.872
I love you, too.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.607
I'm serious. I mean...

11:15.609 --> 11:17.042
Living my life with you is

11:17.044 --> 11:18.877
One of the few things
that's actually

11:18.879 --> 11:22.113
As good in real life
as it is in my imagination.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.615
Like raining phones.

11:23.617 --> 11:26.785
(laughs)
exactly.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.453
I'm serious.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.623
You make me so happy.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.492
And i'm never going to
stop doing just that.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.062
As a math genius, i am
one of the few people

11:37.064 --> 11:39.164
Who understands the
concept of infinity,

11:39.166 --> 11:43.401
And i will love you until
infinity, santana lopez.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.239
And i will love you
until infinity, too, britt.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.647
(school bell ringing)

11:55.649 --> 11:57.248
Sue: Oh, becky,
there's no way

11:57.250 --> 11:59.651
This wouldn't impress
that new boyfriend of yours.

11:59.653 --> 12:03.254
But, coach,
i feel bad that i lied.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.224
Oh, honey, all healthy
relationships are built on lies.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.394
When i got married, i pledged to
be totally honest at all times.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.229
And you know what?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.732
I'm pretty sure that's why
i ended up divorcing myself.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.534
(phone vibrating)
coach, he's here!

12:16.536 --> 12:17.936
Darrell's here!

12:17.938 --> 12:20.271
Ooh, can't wait to meet him!

12:20.273 --> 12:24.075
Becky: This is when
i campaigned against fracking

12:24.077 --> 12:27.412
With mark ruffalo.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.949
Young man, can i ask
you a question?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.350
Yeah.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.353
What are your intentions
with ms. Jackson?

12:35.355 --> 12:38.389
Well, uh, today
i intend to take becky

12:38.391 --> 12:40.225
To fuddruckers for lunch.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.862
Actually, becky, we need to go
if we're gonna beat the rush.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.130
I will bring the car around.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.098
Nice to meet you,
principal sylvester.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.934
Aw!

12:49.936 --> 12:52.103
Isn't he dreamy, coach?

12:53.273 --> 12:56.274
(laughs):
I'm so in love!

12:57.277 --> 12:58.977
(school bell ringing)

12:58.979 --> 13:01.946
(alanis morissette's
"one hand in my pocket" begins)

¶ i'm broke, but i'm happy ¶

13:05.719 --> 13:07.819

15:20.620 --> 15:22.420
(all cheering)

15:22.422 --> 15:24.889
And that is how a mash-up
is done, everyone.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.624
No, actually this is.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.927
Britt, can you take a seat?

15:28.929 --> 15:31.529
Okay.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.131
So, i figure that
this is as good a place

15:33.133 --> 15:34.766
As any to ask you this question.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.701
Um, mainly
because it's gonna

15:36.703 --> 15:39.037
Really upset all the single
guys and gals in here.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.940
But... I want to mash up
with you forever, britt.

15:41.942 --> 15:45.209
I mean, some
people love someone

15:45.211 --> 15:46.811
Because they make
them a better person,

15:46.813 --> 15:48.446
And that's not why i love you,

15:48.448 --> 15:50.815
Because you've always just
wanted me to be myself.

15:50.817 --> 15:53.151
You're my favorite person
in the whole world,

15:53.153 --> 15:56.287
And we're a big
deal, you know?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.822
Like, no matter how many times
we've tried

15:57.824 --> 15:59.657
To put our thing down
and walk away from it,

15:59.659 --> 16:01.826
We can't because i don't want
to live my life

16:01.828 --> 16:04.329
Without my one true love. And...

16:04.331 --> 16:05.763
I normally use
a lot of words

16:05.765 --> 16:07.065
When i'm saying
something negative,

16:07.067 --> 16:08.333
So since this is
the most positive thing

16:08.335 --> 16:10.001
I'm ever gonna do,

16:10.003 --> 16:11.836
I'm gonna keep
it simple.

16:13.907 --> 16:16.040
Brittany s. Pierce...

16:17.944 --> 16:19.744
...Will you marry me?

16:21.314 --> 16:22.747
Wait, what is happening?

16:22.749 --> 16:24.315
This kind of thing happens
in here all the time.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.550
Just go with it.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.419
Oh, my god. I would love to.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.854
Really?
I would love to.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.656
(applause)
oh, my god.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.096
I'm sorry.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.032
I-i just have to speak now
or forever hold my peace.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.768
Um, normally you save that kind
of thing for the wedding.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.636
Did you learn nothing
from me and blaine?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.038
We're too young
to get married.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.272
All of us.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.142
Um, as somebody
who has lived their life

16:51.144 --> 16:52.844
Jealously attacking
the happiness of others,

16:52.846 --> 16:54.612
Even i can't hate
this engagement.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.147
You guys are
perfect together.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.215
Thank you, tina.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.449
(applause)

16:58.451 --> 17:00.284
(excited chatter)

17:02.689 --> 17:04.555
Wait, let me get this straight.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.691
You want me
to fire coach beiste?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.126
I don't want you to fire her.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.994
I didn't even want
to come talk to you.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.362
It's just...
I've been really worried,

17:11.364 --> 17:12.964
And i felt like i had to.

17:12.966 --> 17:15.199
She's been acting really weird.
How so?

17:15.201 --> 17:17.235
Well, first, i noticed
that sam evans

17:17.237 --> 17:18.903
Had been running practices a lot

17:18.905 --> 17:20.471
Because she's been
absent so much.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.206
Also, she started
yelling all the time

17:22.208 --> 17:23.875
About the stupidest things.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.310
Listen, i-i can't just fire
somebody for yelling.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.012
I'm teaching a class
in pedagogical screaming

17:28.014 --> 17:29.580
Over at the community college.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.982
I'd look like a hypocrite.

17:30.984 --> 17:32.483
No, but, listen,
here's the kicker.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.719
Last night, when coach beiste
was locking up,

17:34.721 --> 17:37.355
<i>She was wearing this shirt</i>
<i>from the victoria's secret</i>

17:37.357 --> 17:39.357
<i>Truck driver collection</i>
<i>that was, like,</i>

17:39.359 --> 17:40.892
<i>Five sizes too small,</i>

17:40.894 --> 17:42.727
<i>And she was scarfing down</i>
<i>all these drugs.</i>

17:42.729 --> 17:45.229
<i>She had, like, three bottles</i>
<i>of pills on her desk.</i>

17:47.434 --> 17:49.700
Well, i appreciate
your coming to me.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.536
I'm actually quite envious
of all the snooping around

17:51.538 --> 17:53.838
You've been able to do without
detection. (clicks tongue)

17:53.840 --> 17:56.574
It's like you're
batman, only gay.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.342
I guess it's like you're batman.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.878
Look, she's a great coach, and
i don't want her to get fired.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.513
All i'm saying
is that if she did,

18:02.515 --> 18:04.782
Sam evans could take over.
He's young, he's exciting,

18:04.784 --> 18:06.918
And he's got a lot
of fresh ideas that could bring

18:06.920 --> 18:08.953
This football team
another championship.

18:13.026 --> 18:14.625
(school bell ringing)

18:14.627 --> 18:17.028
Kurt, i just... I don't think
you're being supportive.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.629
You're right.
I'm not being supportive.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.964
I'm not gonna
support something

18:19.966 --> 18:21.632
That i know from
personal experience

18:21.634 --> 18:23.534
Is a horrible decision that
they're going to regret.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.369
Oh, kurt, can i have a word
with you?

18:25.371 --> 18:26.737
Oh, um, i'm gonna go.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.139
No, unibrow, stay.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.441
Kurt, i took what
you said to heart,

18:30.443 --> 18:33.044
And i thought long and hard
about it, and...

18:33.046 --> 18:35.446
It occurred to me
that you may have a point.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.249
Okay, maybe brittany
and i are too young

18:38.251 --> 18:39.984
To get married.
I mean,

18:39.986 --> 18:41.919
After all,
that's why it didn't work out

18:41.921 --> 18:43.087
With you and blaine, right?

18:43.089 --> 18:44.722
Or maybe it
didn't work out

18:44.724 --> 18:46.991
Because you're a judgmental
little gerontophile

18:46.993 --> 18:48.493
With a mouth like a cat's ass.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.094
Maybe blaine got tired
of hearing your shrill,

18:50.096 --> 18:52.130
Self-aggrandizing lecture
about how you felt

18:52.132 --> 18:54.165
The two of you were
at the very apex

18:54.167 --> 18:56.434
Of the gay rights movement
every time you so much as cooked

18:56.436 --> 18:58.269
Macaroni and cheese
together or farted.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.904
Maybe blaine didn't want to
be with someone who looks

18:59.906 --> 19:01.339
Like they just removed
their top row of dentures

19:01.341 --> 19:02.773
Every time they smile

19:02.775 --> 19:04.775
Or someone who doesn't
dress like an extra

19:04.777 --> 19:06.978
Out of one of andy dick's
more elaborate wet dreams.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.779
Maybe blaine grew
weary of dating

19:08.781 --> 19:10.815
A breathier, more
feminine quinn fabray.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.317
Maybe he finally got freaked out
by your strange obsession

19:13.319 --> 19:16.621
With old people that causes you
to skulk around nursing homes

19:16.623 --> 19:18.523
Like one of those cats
that can smell cancer.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.158
Maybe he got tired
of watching you

19:20.160 --> 19:22.627
Drape yourself on every piano
you happen to pass

19:22.629 --> 19:25.029
To entertain
exactly no one with,

19:25.031 --> 19:27.031
Say, some song that
judy garland choked

19:27.033 --> 19:28.633
On her tongue in
the middle of

19:28.635 --> 19:31.435
Or some sassy old
broadway standard made famous

19:31.437 --> 19:33.371
By another dead alcoholic crone.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.006
Maybe blaine woke up one day
and said,

19:35.008 --> 19:36.440
"you know what, i don't
want to marry a sexless,

19:36.442 --> 19:38.309
"self-centered
baton twirler.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.378
Maybe i need someone who knows
more than three dance moves."

19:40.380 --> 19:42.947
The finger wag,
the shoulder shimmy

19:42.949 --> 19:44.882
And the one where you pretend
to twirl

19:44.884 --> 19:48.019
Two invisible rainbow-colored
ribbons attached to your hips.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.887
So, you know what, maybe
that's why it didn't work out.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.156
Maybe it has nothing to do
with me and brittany.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.724
Maybe it's just that
you are utterly,

19:53.726 --> 19:55.693
Utterly intolerable.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.129
Maybe that has something
to do with it.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.174
These are pretty fun. You know,
you just, like, tuck behind.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.909
Becky: Yeah.
Roll the arms.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.012
To the right.
Turn to the right.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.514
Clap. Turn to the left.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.049
All right, sluts, i'm out.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.751
Becky, we just started
practice ten minutes ago.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.221
I have a dinner date
with darrell.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.323
Look, becky, if you're
too tired, just say so.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.424
You don't have to lie.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.059
I'm not lying, tanya.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.427
But here's a lie:

20:29.429 --> 20:33.331
You guys getting in college.
Oh. Oh, snap!

20:33.333 --> 20:36.934
Freshmen 15s
in the house!

20:36.936 --> 20:38.936
(knocking)

20:38.938 --> 20:41.739
There he is.
Told you.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.874
Sorry, becks, but we got to fly

20:43.876 --> 20:45.876
If we're gonna make our 6:30
reservation at shutters.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.678
And you know
they don't like to hold a table.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.082
(chuckles)
let's hit it, boyfriend.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.617
Deuces.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.619
Uh, nice to meet you. Hi.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.521
I'm morally outraged.
Thank you. I gained
five pounds max.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.390
We've got to talk to sue.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.559
Right. Darrell. Of course. Ugh.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.428
(school bell ringing)
why are you using
mounds bars?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.364
Aren't jelly beans
more traditional?

21:06.366 --> 21:08.599
Mounds bars are
the lesbians of candies.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.601
Jelly beans are the gays,
of course.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.471
I used my better-than-yours
math brain to figure out

21:13.473 --> 21:15.973
Exactly how many minutes santana
and i have spent together,

21:15.975 --> 21:19.243
And i'm putting the mini
mounds bars into this giant jar

21:19.245 --> 21:21.212
To give to her
as an engagement present.

21:23.149 --> 21:26.384
I am so sorry that i interrupted
your proposal.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.052
I'm bitter.
I have this firm belief

21:28.054 --> 21:29.920
That people shouldn't
get married until they're 30.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.490
But i believe in you
and santana.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.325
You remind me
of blaine and me.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.762
Except for the fact that she and
i are actually still together.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.131
I'd like to believe
that we're just on a hiatus.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.166
And i'd like to think
that lord tubbington

21:42.168 --> 21:44.602
Isn't secretly videotaping me
while i'm in the shower

21:44.604 --> 21:47.371
And selling it on craigslist.
Doesn't make it true.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.941
(sighs)

21:50.943 --> 21:53.844
Okay, i hate to be the one
to tell you this, but, um,

21:53.846 --> 21:56.480
He's moving in
with dave karofksy.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.849
You know, blaine.
Not lord tubbington.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.751
I was just helping them decorate
yesterday.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.454
Wow.

22:03.456 --> 22:04.655
Yay!

22:04.657 --> 22:05.790
Blaine:
Where's the bed?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.191
Brittany:
I had it removed,

22:07.193 --> 22:08.592
'cause when i pictured
you two having sex,

22:08.594 --> 22:10.828
I imagined a u-haul
mounting a moped.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.030
You need
to start getting over him.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.131
Okay, move on.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.599
Start seeing somebody else.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.535
I'm sure there's
another person in this world

22:17.537 --> 22:19.670
Who will understand
and appreciate

22:19.672 --> 22:22.106
Your particular brand
of eccentricity.

22:22.108 --> 22:25.810
I know, but i just feel like,
if i start seeing someone else

22:25.812 --> 22:28.846
Or even just
go on a date, that...

22:28.848 --> 22:30.881
I'll be admitting
that it's over,

22:30.883 --> 22:34.118
And i-i... I don't want
to do that.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.154
You know... (clears throat)

22:37.156 --> 22:39.623
These mounds bars
are delicious,

22:39.625 --> 22:40.958
But you have to eat them.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.027
If you just hold
them in your hand

22:43.029 --> 22:45.496
Hoping that you might
get to eat them one day,

22:45.498 --> 22:46.664
They're going to melt.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.898
Then you'll look like

22:47.900 --> 22:50.401
Somebody just pooped
in your hand.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.036
Don't let waiting for things

22:52.038 --> 22:54.572
To maybe work out with blaine
turn you into the guy

22:54.574 --> 22:57.041
Who looks like somebody
just pooped in your hand.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.345
I have missed you, britt.
(laughs)

23:01.347 --> 23:04.048
I know. I am awesome.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.549
What are you doing?!
What do you think you're doing?!

23:05.551 --> 23:07.351
Sorry. I don't see
what the problem is.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.353
The problem is, you're dating

23:09.355 --> 23:12.022
Coach sylvester's daughter
robin, and she is not

23:12.024 --> 23:14.158
Okay with it.
Hey, roz, uh,
we're not talking

23:14.160 --> 23:15.326
About my daughter robin.

23:15.328 --> 23:16.761
We're talking
about becky jackson.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.095
She's not my daughter.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.730
I thought your daughter
had down syndrome.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.265
My daughter does
have down syndrome,

23:21.267 --> 23:22.733
As did my late sister.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.035
However, becky jackson
does have down syndrome,

23:25.037 --> 23:27.738
But she is merely
my best friend and confidante.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.373
Roz: Okay, so let me
get this straight.

23:29.375 --> 23:33.344
Your daughter, your sister
and your best friend

23:33.346 --> 23:36.414
All have down syndrome?

23:36.416 --> 23:37.715
What?

23:37.717 --> 23:39.784
Okay, look, darrell,
becky is our friend,

23:39.786 --> 23:41.352
And we have some
questions for you.

23:41.354 --> 23:42.586
Like where did you even meet?

23:42.588 --> 23:43.854
At a quiznos, actually,

23:43.856 --> 23:45.022
Across the street
from her college.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.690
She came in,
and she ordered

23:46.692 --> 23:48.759
Every sandwich on the menu,
and then she tried to pay

23:48.761 --> 23:50.461
With a $10,000 bill
that she counterfeited.

23:50.463 --> 23:51.796
(laughs)

23:51.798 --> 23:53.764
I thought she was really cool
and funny.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.466
We started hanging out.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.635
And when you "hang out,"
what exactly do you do?

23:57.637 --> 23:59.937
Darrell: Probably
the same things you do.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.139
You may find this shocking,
but it turns out

24:02.141 --> 24:04.141
That people with down syndrome
actually like doing

24:04.143 --> 24:05.576
Exactly the same things
that other people do.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.478
Quinn: We just want
to make sure that no one

24:07.480 --> 24:08.979
Is taking
advantage of her.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.548
What do you mean by
"taking advantage of"?

24:10.550 --> 24:11.816
You know, like,
doing certain things

24:11.818 --> 24:13.484
With her
that might not be appropriate.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.920
Okay, why don't you guys
quit beating around the bush?

24:15.922 --> 24:19.089
Just ask me the question
you're obviously dying to ask.

24:19.091 --> 24:21.492
I'll ask.
You having sex with becky?

24:21.494 --> 24:24.495
No, we're not.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.164
Not yet. Our relationship
hasn't gotten to that point.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.467
But at some point, it might,
and if we did have sex,

24:29.469 --> 24:31.402
I-i don't see
what's wrong with that.

24:31.404 --> 24:33.404
Are you kidding?!
Everything is wrong with that!

24:33.406 --> 24:35.139
It's gross,
it's weird...

24:35.141 --> 24:36.574
Darrell: Is it gross
when you have sex?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.075
Don't make us out to be bigots.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.677
Becky is our friend.
We're trying to protect her.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.111
No, you're not. You're trying
to protect yourselves

24:41.113 --> 24:42.580
From something
that you find uncomfortable

24:42.582 --> 24:45.182
Because it doesn't fit
your preconceived notions

24:45.184 --> 24:47.017
About what a relationship is.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.620
You know, when becky and i first
started dating, i actually

24:49.622 --> 24:51.155
Called the national association
for down syndrome.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.990
Nads?
And i asked them
that exact same question.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.159
You know what they told me?
They told me

24:55.161 --> 24:57.361
There was absolutely
nothing wrong with it.

24:57.363 --> 24:59.763
Guys, come on. You sit there
and you try and tell me

24:59.765 --> 25:01.499
That becky doesn't have
the right to live a normal life

25:01.501 --> 25:02.833
Just because
she has down syndrome?

25:02.835 --> 25:05.503
Well, i-i think
that's flat-out wrong.

25:05.505 --> 25:09.507
You should be the ones who have
to explain yourselves, not me.

25:11.344 --> 25:14.678
Wow. That didn't go at all
the way i pictured it.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.387
(carole king's "will you still
love me tomorrow?" begins)

25:25.191 --> 25:29.026
¶ tonight you're mine ¶

25:29.028 --> 25:33.964

26:05.731 --> 26:07.164
Mason:

26:07.166 --> 26:11.235
¶ i had no choice

26:37.129 --> 26:38.696

Both:
¶ will you still love me ¶

26:41.934 --> 26:46.103

26:46.105 --> 26:48.238

26:56.582 --> 26:58.916
¶ oh, oh-oh-oh ¶
¶ when the night ¶

26:58.918 --> 27:00.384
¶ when the night ¶

27:00.386 --> 27:02.319
¶ meets he morn... ¶
¶ meets the morn... ¶

27:02.321 --> 27:07.758
Both:
¶ ...Ing sun ¶

27:07.760 --> 27:10.728
¶ you've already
won me over ¶

27:10.730 --> 27:13.230
Both:
¶ in spite of me ¶

27:13.232 --> 27:15.899
¶ and don't be alarmed
if i fall ¶

27:15.901 --> 27:18.469
¶ head over feet ¶

27:18.471 --> 27:21.505
¶ and don't be surprised
if i love you ¶

27:21.507 --> 27:25.743
¶ for all that you are ¶
¶ all that you are ¶

27:25.745 --> 27:29.313
¶ will you still love me ¶

27:29.315 --> 27:31.749
¶ tomorrow? ¶

27:31.751 --> 27:35.085
¶ you've already won me over ¶

27:35.087 --> 27:39.590
¶ will you still love me ¶

27:39.592 --> 27:46.463
¶ tomorrow? ¶

27:46.465 --> 27:48.999
¶ yeah, yeah. ¶

27:49.001 --> 27:50.734
(song ends)
yay!

27:52.171 --> 27:55.339
Rachel:
Great job, you guys!

27:55.341 --> 27:57.441
I loved the enthusiasm
and the emotion.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.477
Great kick-off
performance. Yay!

28:00.479 --> 28:04.281
I think the singing could have
been a whole step higher.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.050
Mason, your cheerleader

28:06.052 --> 28:07.384
Could have used choreography.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.219
You know, give it variety,
complexity.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.954
Kurt, it was
their first time.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.322
Have you forgotten
what the competition looks like?

28:12.324 --> 28:13.891
You're forgetting
how hard mr. Shue

28:13.893 --> 28:15.325
Had to push us to be champions.

28:15.327 --> 28:18.028
Come with me.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.030
I am trying to be proactive, and
you are just sabotaging that.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.532
My problem is,
you're just

28:21.534 --> 28:23.167
Telling these kids
what they want to hear.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.334
We are in this to win it,

28:24.336 --> 28:25.703
And we are a long
way from it.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.571
Brutal honesty's
our only hope.

28:27.573 --> 28:29.373
You know, these clashes
that you're creating--

28:29.375 --> 28:30.574
They are not proactive,
and they're hurting

28:30.576 --> 28:31.809
The team, and right now,

28:31.811 --> 28:33.243
I think that you should
just go home,

28:33.245 --> 28:35.479
And i'm gonna take it
from here today.

28:39.585 --> 28:41.585
(school bell ringing)

28:45.157 --> 28:47.891
Shannon, you and i need
to have a frank discussion

28:47.893 --> 28:50.527
About something that you might
find uncomfortable.

28:50.529 --> 28:53.530
However, i don't want you to
grab me by the throat and crotch

28:53.532 --> 28:55.399
And hurl me
into that wall behind me...

28:55.401 --> 28:57.668
(sighs)
...Which i believe is well
within your abilities.

28:57.670 --> 28:59.169
Sue, what do you want
to talk about?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.537
Well, i've been approached

29:00.539 --> 29:02.372
By more than one
individual at this school

29:02.374 --> 29:04.108
Concerned about
your well-being

29:04.110 --> 29:07.778
Upon observation of a sharp
change in your behavior.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.847
And after two to
three milliseconds

29:09.849 --> 29:11.615
Of deep soul-searching,

29:11.617 --> 29:14.551
I decided to exercise my
authority as principal

29:14.553 --> 29:16.520
And rifle through all
of your desk drawers.

29:16.522 --> 29:19.957
There i found several
prescription medications,

29:19.959 --> 29:22.559
Among them gnrh,

29:22.561 --> 29:24.962
That wikipedia tells me
is a type of steroid

29:24.964 --> 29:27.397
Used for certain
medical treatments.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.199
So, shannon,
i'm going to ask you something,

29:29.201 --> 29:31.468
And i need for you
to answer me honestly.

29:32.471 --> 29:35.038
Coach beiste,

29:35.040 --> 29:37.875
Do you have cancer?

29:39.779 --> 29:41.578
Yes.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.281
I'm so sorry.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.450
I-i know this is
a huge inconvenience.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.519
Shannon, just stop stammering.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.423
You know, you and i haven't
always seen eye to eye.

29:53.425 --> 29:57.394
And i'm not using that metaphor
just because you look exactly

29:57.396 --> 30:00.798
How i picture greek mythology's
legendary cyclops.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.902
I promise you, i'm gonna do
everything i can to help you.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.069
Sue, you don't have to.

30:06.071 --> 30:08.305
Everything.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.308
(sighs)

30:22.855 --> 30:24.922
Okay, don't worry. We'll give
you a cue, okay, becky?

30:24.924 --> 30:26.824
And then just burst
in like mercedes.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.592
Okay, okay, i got it.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.428
I'm going to nail it.
You are.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.864
(carole king's
"so far away" begins)

30:43.375 --> 30:46.677
¶ so far away ¶

30:46.679 --> 30:53.317
¶ doesn't anybody stay
in one place anymore? ¶

30:53.319 --> 30:58.655
¶ it would be so fine
to see your face at my door ¶

30:58.657 --> 31:01.892
¶ doesn't help to know ¶

31:01.894 --> 31:05.062
¶ you're just time away ¶

31:05.064 --> 31:08.565
¶ long ago i reached for you ¶

31:08.567 --> 31:12.035
¶ and there you stood ¶

31:12.037 --> 31:14.905
¶ holding you again could only ¶

31:14.907 --> 31:17.207
¶ do me good ¶

31:17.209 --> 31:20.711
¶ how i wish i could ¶

31:20.713 --> 31:24.581
¶ but you're so far away ¶

31:28.053 --> 31:33.924
¶ one more song
about moving along the highway ¶

31:33.926 --> 31:40.497
¶ i can't say much
of anything that's new ¶

31:40.499 --> 31:46.370
¶ if i could only work this life
out my way... ¶

31:46.372 --> 31:47.604
(music stops)

31:49.742 --> 31:52.576
Well, you really can't
blame her for not joining in.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.044
These two were
very pitchy.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.545
So, uh,

31:55.547 --> 31:57.748
Let them work it out.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.121
Hey, becky.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.789
What happened
back there?

32:05.791 --> 32:07.291
I couldn't do it.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.926
I told you i should have
taken the mercedes moment.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.360
Pretty sure that's not
what she was talking about.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.762
As soon as i
started singing,

32:11.764 --> 32:13.897
Darrell was going to know

32:13.899 --> 32:17.134
That i was lying
about being in glee club.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.635
What do you think
he thinks now?

32:18.637 --> 32:20.070
I think her plan is brilliant.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.738
I always find that literally

32:21.740 --> 32:23.473
Running away from my problems
is usually my safest play.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.242
Look, we've all lied at
the beginning of a relationship.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.944
I told finn that he was
the father of my baby.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.278
I told artie
i had a stutter.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.613
I told everyone
i was straight.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.448
I once told a guy
i had three vaginas,

32:31.450 --> 32:33.583
And he was pretty bummed when
he found out i only had two.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.452
Quinn: The point being
is that most people,

32:35.454 --> 32:37.087
To get through that first
getting-to-know-you phase,

32:37.089 --> 32:38.722
Do everything they
can to make sure

32:38.724 --> 32:40.557
The other person
doesn't get to know them.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.292
At least not
the real them.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.594
Praise. Real relationship
can't start till you stop being

32:44.596 --> 32:46.964
Who you think the other person
wants you to be

32:46.966 --> 32:48.899
And just be yourself,
come what may.
Mm-hmm.

32:48.901 --> 32:51.001
You guys know
it's different for me.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.637
How often am i gonna
get a chance

32:53.639 --> 32:55.272
To get a guy like darrell?

32:55.274 --> 32:56.773
I think he really likes you.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.442
It's true. I see
how he looks at you

32:58.444 --> 33:00.143
When you're not looking.
I wish a guy would

33:00.145 --> 33:01.578
Look at me like that.
Quinn:
Mm-hmm.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.779
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.448
I blocked your voice
a few months ago

33:04.450 --> 33:06.249
Because everything you say
is depressing and about you.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.851
Quinn:
Okay, look, becky,

33:07.853 --> 33:09.286
How long are you
gonna do this for?

33:09.288 --> 33:10.754
You gonna lie to him
your whole life?

33:10.756 --> 33:12.589
That's what sue said to do.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.358
Sue also told us
to be honest with you

33:14.360 --> 33:16.193
And treat you like
we would treat anyone else,

33:16.195 --> 33:17.327
So let's just say it.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.695
You can't sing,
you can't dance,

33:18.697 --> 33:20.530
And you weren't in
any of those clubs,

33:20.532 --> 33:23.200
Because you're kind of lazy
and pretty toxic to be around.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.369
You call people
stupid bitches,

33:25.371 --> 33:26.703
And get mad at xylophones.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.638
You're not really
a catch, but...

33:28.640 --> 33:30.807
You found this guy who digs you,
and you dig him, too,

33:30.809 --> 33:32.009
And finding someone to put up

33:32.011 --> 33:33.510
With you is rare, so...

33:33.512 --> 33:34.544
I mean all of this

33:34.546 --> 33:36.480
In the nicest way.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.849
You have to take a chance that
he likes you for real reasons,

33:38.851 --> 33:40.317
And tell him the truth.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.319
And then your relationship
can really start.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.054
Thanks, guys.

33:44.056 --> 33:47.824
You're mostly stupid bitches,
but you're pretty cool, too.

33:47.826 --> 33:48.725
(sniffles)

33:48.727 --> 33:50.861
All:
Aw.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.263
(laughter)

33:56.368 --> 33:57.701
No need to lecture me.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.169
I know i screwed up.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.871
I broke the cardinal rule
of teaching:

34:00.873 --> 34:02.372
Leave your baggage at home.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.007
Or at least check your baggage

34:04.009 --> 34:06.309
So the whole plane doesn't
have to smell your stinky socks.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.045
Don't worry.
We've all been there.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.080
Heartbreak poisons the brain.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.882
So i am grasping

34:11.884 --> 34:14.651
For control
where it is not appropriate.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.820
I'm sorry.
I was way out of line.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.822
You weren't. You were right.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.023
Jane and mason

34:20.025 --> 34:21.925
Came to talk to me this morning.

34:21.927 --> 34:23.660
Jane:
We've been watching

34:23.662 --> 34:25.896
Youtubes of the new directions!
At regionals and nationals.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.497
We want to be as good
as you guys were.

34:27.499 --> 34:29.266
If we're going to do this,
we want to be champions.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.768
And that's not gonna happen
if you go easy on us.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.703
Kurt was right. We didn't work
hard enough on our number,

34:33.705 --> 34:35.539
And we're gonna need someone
like kurt being brutally

34:35.541 --> 34:37.007
Honest with us
if we want to be the best.

34:37.009 --> 34:38.875
I need you, kurt,
as my codirector.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.178
I need you here
to keep me honest.

34:41.180 --> 34:44.214
I-i think, because we're so
close, we forget sometimes

34:44.216 --> 34:46.917
That we have different views
of life, but they both work.

34:46.919 --> 34:49.419
Did they really say that
about me?

34:49.421 --> 34:51.121
That i helped them?

34:51.123 --> 34:53.457
It feels good, doesn't it?

34:56.261 --> 34:57.961
Holy crap, we're teachers.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.229
(laughs)

34:59.231 --> 35:01.231
Well, i think,
between the two of us,

35:01.233 --> 35:02.866
We make a pretty
good one.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.068
So, what do you say?

35:05.070 --> 35:09.573
We do this together,
changing the world?

35:09.575 --> 35:11.074
Deal?

35:11.076 --> 35:13.210
Deal.
Deal.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.950
(school bell ringing)
uh, what's going on?

35:19.952 --> 35:21.218
You guys said it was urgent?

35:21.220 --> 35:22.285
Sue:
Uh, yes. Coach beiste

35:22.287 --> 35:23.587
Asked me to
summon you.

35:23.589 --> 35:24.988
Have a seat. Shannon,

35:24.990 --> 35:26.156
Proceed.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.558
Um...

35:28.560 --> 35:29.893
You may have noticed

35:29.895 --> 35:31.428
That i've been acting
sort of weird lately.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.063
Yeah.

35:33.065 --> 35:35.565
Taking a lot
of personal days and stuff.

35:35.567 --> 35:39.302
Well, the truth is, is...
I've been seeing some doctors.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.770
Okay, this is taking too long.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.172
What coach beiste is

35:42.174 --> 35:44.141
Trying to say
is that she has cancer.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.742
You have cancer?!
No, i don't.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.777
What?
Wait. So, you don't...
You don't have cancer?

35:47.779 --> 35:49.613
No, i told sue that,
but it was a lie.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.148
What?!
Wait. What's going...
What's going on?

35:51.150 --> 35:52.449
This is an outrage.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.151
You don't lie
about having cancer

35:54.153 --> 35:56.153
Unless you're trying
to get out of jury duty,

35:56.155 --> 35:58.488
Or explain away
a particularly bad haircut.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.257
This will explain everything.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.993
It's a letter from
my psychologist, dr. Shane.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.028
"it is my assessment

36:05.030 --> 36:07.998
"that patient shannon beiste
meets all the necessary criteria

36:08.000 --> 36:10.433
"for a diagnosis of
gender dysphoria,

36:10.435 --> 36:14.204
Dsm-5, code 302.85."

36:14.206 --> 36:16.706
Holy mother of god.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.141
Wait, i don't... I don't...

36:18.143 --> 36:19.776
Yeah, what is that,
that gender dys-what, uh...?

36:19.778 --> 36:23.046
Well, pumpkin, it's where
your outsides don't match

36:23.048 --> 36:24.781
How you feel you
are on the inside.

36:24.783 --> 36:28.618
This letter is
my first step

36:28.620 --> 36:32.522
Into legally transitioning
from a woman to a man.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.891
When you think about it,
it's not that big of a stretch.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.193
Okay, i don't... I don't get it.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.394
So you're like a...
You're like a lesbian?

36:37.396 --> 36:38.528
Kiddo, this isn't about

36:38.530 --> 36:40.163
Who i want to go to bed with.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.399
It's about who i want
to go to bed as.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.201
I've always been attracted

36:44.203 --> 36:47.204
To men, and-and they say
that's not gonna change.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.873
You're gonna be, like...?
You want to be a gay man?

36:49.875 --> 36:51.908
Wow, really
thought i heard

36:51.910 --> 36:54.811
Of every conceivable version
of a gay man coming out.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.480
I'm confused. I feel like i...
This is coming out of nowhere.

36:57.482 --> 37:00.417
Kiddo, i know this may
seem sudden to you,

37:00.419 --> 37:02.485
But it doesn't to me.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.221
So, how long
have you felt this way?

37:04.223 --> 37:07.524
I've felt like this
my whole life.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.726
Growing up, i was...
I was really confused.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.595
I thought i was just a tomboy.

37:11.597 --> 37:14.531
So, i got into sports,
i started coaching football,

37:14.533 --> 37:17.000
And i wrestled hogs
in my free time,

37:17.002 --> 37:18.401
But no matter
what i did,

37:18.403 --> 37:19.836
I never felt

37:19.838 --> 37:21.504
At home in my own skin.

37:21.506 --> 37:25.508
I never felt like my body
fit who i was on the inside.

37:25.510 --> 37:29.212
I don't hate
being a woman,

37:29.214 --> 37:31.381
And i don't regret the
things i've been through,

37:31.383 --> 37:34.117
Because they've made me
the person i am today.

37:34.119 --> 37:37.020
A person strong enough to go
through with this transition.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.888
I got to do it

37:38.890 --> 37:40.123
For my own peace of mind.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.858
I got to get my
body in alignment

37:41.860 --> 37:43.627
With how i see myself.

37:46.131 --> 37:48.064
(sighs)

37:48.066 --> 37:50.433
I'm gonna need you
to take over as coach

37:50.435 --> 37:52.702
When i start the
procedures next week.

37:52.704 --> 37:56.273
I'm gonna have surgery
to have my breasts removed,

37:56.275 --> 37:57.941
And then i'm gonna start
taking testosterone.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.442
Okay, i'm gonna stop you
right there.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.611
Please spare
us the details

38:01.613 --> 38:03.213
Of the literal sausage-making.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.982
I just want to let you know,

38:05.984 --> 38:08.351
Should you choose
to return to this school...

38:09.755 --> 38:12.088
...Your job will be waiting.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.723
(sobs softly)

38:13.725 --> 38:15.158
(sniffles)

38:15.160 --> 38:16.726
We got your back.

38:16.728 --> 38:17.761
Thank you.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.763
Okay.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.465
I love you guys so much.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.402
Here you go-- strawberry
milk shake, two straws.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.470
Thanks.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.839
The milk shakes at fuddruckers
are so much better.

38:29.841 --> 38:33.410
Well, we're not allowed to go
back to fuddruckers, remember?

38:33.412 --> 38:35.578
The waitress was rude.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.681
They're supposed to be rude.
That's, like, their thing.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.083
You can't just
hit people, becky.

38:40.085 --> 38:43.953
Listen, darrell,

38:43.955 --> 38:46.456
It's really great
having you here,

38:46.458 --> 38:49.859
But i haven't been
completely honest with you,

38:49.861 --> 38:52.595
And it's eating me up inside.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.130
What is it?

38:54.132 --> 38:57.100
First of all,
i have down syndrome.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.935
Yes, i know.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.303
Good.

39:00.305 --> 39:03.206
I also have to
tell you that

39:03.208 --> 39:07.210
I really wasn't the president
of those clubs in high school.

39:07.212 --> 39:10.347
And i can't sing.

39:10.349 --> 39:12.048
You know, i sort of suspected

39:12.050 --> 39:13.717
You were exaggerating
a little bit

39:13.719 --> 39:16.553
When you said you were
the fifth member of 98 degrees.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.955
I mean, that's just something
i looked up on my phone.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.624
I shouldn't lie to you.

39:21.626 --> 39:23.727
I wanted to impress you.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.995
Becky, you don't have
to impress me.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.998
I already like you,
and i'll like you just the same

39:29.000 --> 39:34.738
Whether you're angela merkel's
most trusted advisor or not.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.806
People think it's weird
that i like you,

39:36.808 --> 39:39.075
For whatever reason.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.711
There's gonna be a lot
of outside pressure on us.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.980
We have to know that,
no matter what,

39:43.982 --> 39:45.382
We've got each other's backs.

39:45.384 --> 39:48.885
It's just going
to take me some time

39:48.887 --> 39:53.323
To get used to a guy
having my back.

39:53.325 --> 39:54.924
Well, get used to it, becky.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.693
(laughs)

39:56.695 --> 39:57.927
'cause i've got it.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.163
It sounds like a plan.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.969
Gross! This milk shake sucks!

40:10.275 --> 40:12.075
(both laugh)

40:12.077 --> 40:13.076
(school bell ringing)

40:13.078 --> 40:14.444
Before we wrap things up,

40:14.446 --> 40:16.079
Kurt and i just wanted
to say together

40:16.081 --> 40:17.614
That we're very proud
of you guys.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.749
Although we've just begun
to jell as a team,

40:19.751 --> 40:21.050
We learned this week

40:21.052 --> 40:22.585
That two very different styles
of teaching,

40:22.587 --> 40:23.953
Although may clash sometimes--

40:23.955 --> 40:26.289
They yield very important
lessons learned.

40:26.291 --> 40:29.125
That sort of sounded like you
were congratulating yourselves.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.126
You get used to it.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.394
Guys, the point being

40:31.396 --> 40:32.962
Is that we took
our inner caroles

40:32.964 --> 40:34.464
And our inner alanises...

40:34.466 --> 40:35.632
Uh, alani.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.867
We took the jagged
and the smooth,

40:37.869 --> 40:40.136
The angry and the sad,
and the joyful,

40:40.138 --> 40:41.738
And created something new.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.972
Mash-ups aren't always pretty.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.374
But they're worth the risk.

40:44.376 --> 40:46.042
Now we know
you guys are ready.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.143
Ready for what?

40:47.145 --> 40:49.479
The road to sectionals.

40:50.782 --> 40:55.652
¶<i> do-do, do-do-do</i> ¶
