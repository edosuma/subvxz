WEBVTT

00:12.320 --> 00:13.560
I'm doing the best I can.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.160
Are you?

00:15.240 --> 00:16.080
Because it feels like we have
the same argument

00:16.160 --> 00:17.480
at least once a month.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.800
Only because you're pushing
too hard.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.040
Chris is getting suspicious.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.360
I don't care.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.640
You made promises to me.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.160
Give me a little more time.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.200
Please.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.200
Maybe we should just
tell him everything.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.480
Jake, don't!

00:34.560 --> 00:36.160
It'll ruin him!

00:36.240 --> 00:37.400
Don't!

00:37.480 --> 00:39.200
Jake!

00:55.600 --> 00:56.600
Thanks for the call.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.640
You want me to follow you out?

00:57.720 --> 00:59.800
No, I'll take it from here.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.880
It's not your problem anymore.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.400
Go ahead and light up
your siren.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.120
[sirens blaring]

01:24.200 --> 01:25.160
[raps top of car]

01:27.920 --> 01:29.640
Thanks.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.680
At least you picked a friendly
district to get tanked in.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.440
It was all a big
misunderstanding.

01:58.520 --> 02:02.400
They said you were holding three
guys at bay with a pool cue.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.240
Where's your car?

02:04.320 --> 02:06.080
All I need is a breakfast
sandwich,

02:06.160 --> 02:08.240
a cup of coffee,
and a shower.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.080
I'll figure out the car later.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.480
Well, we can take care of the
first two at a drive through,

02:12.560 --> 02:14.000
but the closest thing
you're gonna get to a shower

02:14.080 --> 02:16.240
are the wet wipes
in the glove box.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.200
Chen called.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.960
We got a homicide.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.080
Ok, great.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.800
Thank you.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
Um, keep canvassing
the area.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.760
A forklift driver found
a lone barrel on the dock

02:39.840 --> 02:41.160
at the start of his shift.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.400
He assumed it was
from the day before

02:42.480 --> 02:45.440
and loaded it on the truck.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.160
Things went sideways after that.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.840
[vomiting]

02:58.200 --> 02:59.720
How's that breakfast sandwich?

02:59.800 --> 03:02.680
♪ Everything is fading,♪

03:02.760 --> 03:06.560
♪ Everything is fading,♪

03:06.640 --> 03:10.120

03:10.200 --> 03:11.360

03:11.440 --> 03:12.720
A strap came loose.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.880
Sent three of the drums
onto their side,

03:14.960 --> 03:21.520
spilled what's left of buddy
onto the ground and my shoes.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.240
Where did the drums come from?

03:25.320 --> 03:26.480
They fill them here.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.720
Ethan Ridley.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.720
I manage the warehouse.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.720
Oh...

03:31.800 --> 03:33.040
Oh my god.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.120
Eyes on me, Ethan.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.840
Don't look over there.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.520
Any idea who filled the drums?

03:37.600 --> 03:38.480
Our shippers.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.560
We have three.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.080
It would have been Murray.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.240
But that drum, that one there,
it's not ours.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.320
You sure?

03:44.400 --> 03:45.880
Yeah.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.360
It looks like it was spray
painted the same colour.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.240
The bottoms of ours are red,
this one's blue.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.560
How'd it wind up
at your warehouse?

03:51.640 --> 03:54.000
You tell me.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.400
I really don't know.

04:04.960 --> 04:05.880
Thank you, gentlemen.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.280
You've been very helpful.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.800
Kate, there you are.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.120
It came straight from
the Coroner's office.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.040
I've got cause of death
for your vic.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.640
Let's hear it.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.480
Based on the burns to the lips,
esophagus and lungs,

04:16.560 --> 04:19.360
your vic drowned in
the contents of the drum.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.720
He went into the barrel alive?

04:20.800 --> 04:22.080
If the drum hadn't been
knocked over

04:22.160 --> 04:23.400
he would have
completely dissolved.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.840
Can you establish
a time of death?

04:24.920 --> 04:26.840
In the 40's a killer named
George Haigh

04:26.920 --> 04:29.440
used sulphuric acid to dispose
of six victims.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.160
He dumped the bodies
in 45 gallon oil drums

04:31.240 --> 04:34.600
and waited two days
for them to dissolve.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.720
Based on what's left of this guy
I'd say it happened

04:36.800 --> 04:41.080
about 12 hours ago,
between 11:00 and 2:00
last night.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.560
I found an 8mm film strip
submerged in the body fat.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.560
A film strip?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.080
Why didn't that dissolve?

04:46.160 --> 04:47.600
There's enough degradation
to ruin the image

04:47.680 --> 04:49.360
but plastics and organics
react differently.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.080
That's why you can
buy drain cleaner

04:51.160 --> 04:55.240
that's 95 percent sulphuric acid
in a plastic bottle.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.160
Oh, I saved the best for last.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.040
What is it?

05:03.120 --> 05:04.120
It used to be his tibia.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.880
That was inside his leg.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.360
He got the implant two years
ago after a motorcycle accident.

05:08.440 --> 05:12.400
The serial number
gave us his name.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.320
Our victim is Jake Merridew,

05:14.400 --> 05:17.080
a programmer at the Cottonwood
Cinema, lives with his dad.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.200
Would have been
the perfect crime

05:18.280 --> 05:19.760
if it went according to plan.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.320
Find out where to buy oil drums
and sulphuric acid

05:21.400 --> 05:23.600
and follow up with forensics
on the film stock.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.760
[phone ringing]

05:24.840 --> 05:26.040
What's wrong?

05:26.120 --> 05:27.320
My son's school.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.960
We should start
at the vic's house.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.560
You two.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.120
Community day is next week
and the chief

05:33.200 --> 05:34.880
is looking for volunteers
from the department.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.920
A couple hours of
community outreach.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
That sounds right up
Kate's alley.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.200
That's a great idea, Nolan.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.280
Yeah. I need a coffee.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.000
So what's this about Nolan
getting in a bar fight

05:52.080 --> 05:54.560
in another district?

05:54.640 --> 05:56.240
I don't know where
he goes between shifts,

05:56.320 --> 05:58.760
but he seems fine.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.400
I'll assume it's a rumour.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.160
Jake's father leaves keys with me in case of emergencies.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.640
What can you tell me
about Jake?

06:10.720 --> 06:13.080
He programmed films
at the Cottonwood.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.760
He was good people,
so was his dad.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.760
I've lived beside them
for ten years.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.120
Sam will be devastated.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.080
How can I reach him?

06:19.160 --> 06:20.640
He's in Chile right now.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.560
He travels a lot.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.680
He works in mining.

06:22.760 --> 06:23.680
When did he leave?

06:23.760 --> 06:24.600
About a week ago.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.480
I can give you his cell.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.240
Did you notice anything
unusual about Jake recently?

06:29.320 --> 06:31.040
Or anything different
around the house?

06:31.120 --> 06:35.000
No, it's a pretty laid back
street outside of Tom Watson.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.120
He lives next door,
complains about everything.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.360
Music too loud, too much
smoke from your barbecue,

06:39.440 --> 06:40.920
you name it.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.920
He and Jake were always at it.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.160
Ok.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.480
Uh, thank you.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.840
I'm gonna need that number.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.080
Drop off the keys
when you're done.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.880
Found cocaine and vitamin K
in the desk drawer.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.600
Ketamine?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.200
This was stashed
with the drugs.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.760
Weird place for a photo.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.680
Who's the mystery woman
in the photograph?

07:01.760 --> 07:03.240
Good question.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.480
Well, there's a neighbour
we should question.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.640
He had a running dispute
with Jake.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.840
I need a shower.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.880
Oh, I know.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.880
But first things first.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.640
First things first.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.960
But not because
you said so.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.600
Jake taught his dog to shit
on my lawn.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.720
For a whole year
I put up with it.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.520
There's no dog
at Jake's house.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.240
A rogue car took care
of him for me.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.040
It was a hit and run.

07:30.120 --> 07:35.080
Jake was found dead
two nights ago.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.200
Well, I guess he got
what was coming to him.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.760
You filed several
noise complaints

07:39.840 --> 07:41.200
against him last week.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.040
Because I could hardly
hear myself think.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.200
Like, he'd crank up the bass on
his stereo just to piss me off.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.720
So you went over
to confront him?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.480
Yeah, but I didn't get
the chance

07:50.560 --> 07:53.040
'cause he was arguing with
some girl on his front porch.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.280
What did she look like?

07:54.360 --> 07:58.800
White, tall, brownish hair.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.200
Do you recognize this woman?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.000
That's her.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.680
She was really laying into him,

08:04.760 --> 08:08.240
so I just went back
to enjoy my beer.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.960
When was this?

08:10.040 --> 08:11.680
The night before last.

08:11.760 --> 08:12.760
Ok, I'm gonna need to know
your whereabouts last night

08:12.840 --> 08:14.960
between 11:00 pm and 2:00 am.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.600
Oh, that's easy.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.240
I was talking on the phone
with my mom.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.000
At 2:00 am?

08:21.080 --> 08:24.000
She lives in Australia.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.240
Hey.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.600
Everything ok with your son?

08:29.680 --> 08:30.840
He got in a fight at school.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.160
Emily's there now.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.960
Sounds like a juvie case
in the making.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.360
Not on my watch.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.520
You got anything?

08:36.600 --> 08:37.800
Drugs maybe,
but not much.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.200
You?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.640
I pulled this from
the Cottonwood site.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.600
They screened an Italian
horror film last month.

08:42.680 --> 08:44.280
24 Omega.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.520
In it a victim is murdered
by way of "white shotgun".

08:48.600 --> 08:50.200
I'm guessing you don't mean
that literally.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.960
He put a body in a barrel
of acid and it disappears.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.520
Seem familiar?

08:54.600 --> 08:56.160
Looks like we found our
connection to the barrel.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.040
Let's catch a matinee.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.200
Oh, theatre's closed.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.840
Detective Kate Jameson.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.280
This is my partner,
Detective Nolan Wells.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.760
I need to ask you
a few questions

09:17.840 --> 09:19.800
about one of your employees,
Jake Merridew?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.680
When was the last time
you saw him?

09:21.760 --> 09:23.680
Uh, he worked the screenings
last night.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.760
When did he leave?

09:24.840 --> 09:26.520
I don't know, but my wife might.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.720
I own the place, she runs it.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.800
I left around 10:00.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.240
Has something happened?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.120
Do you store any 8mm film
prints here?

09:33.200 --> 09:34.520
Or maybe have one go missing?

09:34.600 --> 09:36.680
No, we gave up on film
a few years ago.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.280
8mm sounds more
like a home movie.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.920
Jake have any problems
with staff?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.920
Customers?

09:42.000 --> 09:42.880
No.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.200
What's this all about?

09:44.280 --> 09:46.600
Jake was found dead
this morning.

09:48.200 --> 09:52.400
Honey, everything ok?

09:52.480 --> 09:54.880
Can you excuse me a minute?

09:57.120 --> 10:00.720
Nolan, that's the woman
from the photo.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.960
The same one that was ripping
him a new one at Jake's house.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.480
Jake left around 11:30,
after the late show.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.600
And you?

10:15.680 --> 10:17.800
I didn't get out of here
until after 2:00am.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.880
I was going through old posters
for a charity drive with Brody,

10:20.960 --> 10:22.520
one of our ushers.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.280
How would you describe
your relationship with Jake?

10:25.360 --> 10:26.800
He was a good programmer.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.640
Your relationship was
strictly professional?

10:30.720 --> 10:32.440
Yes.

10:32.520 --> 10:37.160
He kept an old photo of you.
Any reason he would have that?

10:37.240 --> 10:38.920
You didn't know Jake had it?

10:39.000 --> 10:39.920
Can I see it?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.080
Certainly.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.920
It's down at the station.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.680
Only eight people saw 24 Omega.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.760
Plus any other staff
that worked that night.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.040
What'd you turn up?

10:50.120 --> 10:51.640
Well, Alicia's hiding something.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.920
She claims she's got no idea
how Jake got that photo.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.360
She have an alibi?

10:55.440 --> 10:57.400
She was working late
with one of the ushers.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.560
Hmm.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.760
Follow up on that.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.320
A tiny place like this?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.440
If there was any animosity
between Jake and Alicia

11:03.520 --> 11:06.040
the staff would know.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.760
Are you really not gonna pay
for that?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.680
The rest of the staff
start shift in an hour.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.040
We'll circle back then.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.840
Alicia asked me to help out
on a poster drive

11:22.920 --> 11:25.040
raising money for charity.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.400
I couldn't really say no.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.680
You were with her
the whole time?

11:27.760 --> 11:29.920
She's a control freak.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.720
What did the staff
think about Jake?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.240
He was a good guy.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.920
A lot of fun.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.280
He threw these after parties
and Alicia turned

11:39.360 --> 11:41.280
a blind eye as long
as he cut her in.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.800
Thanks.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.160
24 Omega was Jake's
favourite film.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.400
We screened it a couple times
but subtitled horror

11:49.480 --> 11:50.840
isn't really a draw.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.200
You work those screenings?

11:52.280 --> 11:55.440
Front cash. Pretty dull shift.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.240
What happened the night
Jake died?

11:57.320 --> 11:59.160
He showed up with a DJ
and a few kegs.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.400
Chris heard, freaked out
and fired him.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.280
No one thought that
could ever happen,

12:03.360 --> 12:04.720
but Alicia intervened.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.440
Jake could do no wrong
in Alicia's eyes.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.880
He worked hard
but he was arrogant.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.480
Never had a conversation
that wasn't about himself.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.520
Did Alicia pay him
any special attention?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.640
Meetings after hours,
arriving at work together,

12:16.720 --> 12:18.320
anything like that?

12:18.400 --> 12:23.000
Jake was always in her office
with the door closed.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.880
Thanks for your help.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.080
Apparently, Jake and Alicia
had a lot to talk about.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.160
Meetings alone in her office
more often than not.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.760
They were having an affair.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.160
I wonder if the husband knew.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.760
Of course he knew.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.040
Do you think that's enough
for murder?

12:37.120 --> 12:39.680
We get a confession from
Alicia about the affair,

12:39.760 --> 12:41.280
we got motive.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.040
The police are questioning
my staff.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.280
Gathering evidence.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.600
It's not good.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.160
You're overreacting.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.840
If you were in danger
we'd take care of it.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.800
You need to get me
out of this mess.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.960
Have you told me everything
I need to know, Alicia?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.880
So I was able to get
your car back.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.760
You got your keys?

13:14.840 --> 13:16.120
[message alert]

13:16.200 --> 13:18.520
I wasn't that drunk.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.840
Is that Chen?

13:30.560 --> 13:33.000
Looks like someone left me
a voicemail.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.560

We'll pay Chris and Alicia
a visit in the morning.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.280
Hey.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.400
Thank you.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.960
I can't identify the origin
of this text.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.920
The sender's probably using
phishing software

14:52.000 --> 14:54.800
which masks the source but shows
a legitimate number.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.120
The file was created
a few weeks ago.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.760
So it's not connected
to my current case?

14:58.840 --> 15:00.840
The only clue you've got to go
on is the material.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.160
Do you know what
the song is about?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.800
Some say it's about witnessing
a crime,

15:03.880 --> 15:05.880
others say it's
about committing one.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.560
It could be a tip?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.560
Or a threat.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.160
Thanks.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.480
Am I good to use this?

15:13.560 --> 15:15.080

She looks forward
to your support

15:36.720 --> 15:37.680

Please leave a message.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.560
Hi.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.560
You must be Emily.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.600
I'm Kate.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.200
It's nice to put a face
to the name.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.280
Looks like you've got
your hands full.

15:58.360 --> 15:59.840
Goodnight.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.480
One second.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.840
So what's this about you getting
in a fight at school with Kevin?

16:11.920 --> 16:14.800
You can tell me.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.200
He called you and mom...

16:21.080 --> 16:23.520
Dykes.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.400
Hey, look.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.680
Anyone who speaks
to you like that,

16:28.760 --> 16:30.680
their opinion doesn't matter.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.560
I'm proud of you for standing up
for what you believe in.

16:39.640 --> 16:44.520
Your technique needs a little
work. Ok?

16:46.320 --> 16:47.880
We spoke with your staff.

16:47.960 --> 16:48.920
They gave us a very
different take

16:49.000 --> 16:50.160
on your relationship with Jake.

16:50.240 --> 16:54.000
I've been advised
to say nothing.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.480
We respect your right
to silence,

16:56.560 --> 17:00.480
but we know Chris fired Jake
and you stepped in.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.320
We also know that a film
you screened recently

17:02.400 --> 17:04.720
contained a scene that mirrors
Jake's death.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.320
[door opens]

17:06.400 --> 17:07.480
This interview is over.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.360

17:08.440 --> 17:09.400
Cue the attorney.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.120
Mrs. Bennett, you're free to go.

17:16.360 --> 17:18.600
That woman is a prime suspect
in our murder case.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.480
She lawyered up 'cause she's got
something to hide.

17:20.560 --> 17:21.640
He's not a lawyer.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.560
He's a government agent.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.480
Alicia Bennett is
in witness protection.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.440
95 percent of people in witness
protection have priors.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.680
They're all dirty.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.440
How am I supposed
to ignore that?

17:38.520 --> 17:39.960
Your job isn't to piss and moan
about how bad you've got it.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.240
Find another way.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.680
She was having an affair
with the victim.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.360
Without hard evidence
she's off limits.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.800
And be careful how
you go about it.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.560
Her husband doesn't
even know her past.

17:47.640 --> 17:53.440
If she can hide that from him,
what else is she hiding?

17:53.520 --> 17:54.760
Sit down.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.440
What're you doing, man?

18:00.520 --> 18:02.200

18:02.280 --> 18:04.200
Not how it looks
from where I sit.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.840
I know you and Leah are
having marriage issues,

18:05.920 --> 18:08.600
but you can't bring that stuff
to work.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.000
I don't wanna bench you,
so deal with it.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.120
Talk to someone.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.440
Whatever it takes, man.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.280
I'm focussed on the case,
alright.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.240
Why is she in protection?

18:23.320 --> 18:25.280
Information on that is sealed.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.240
All I know is that she's seen
some dark days.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.320
Get out.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.200
Find me a witness I can hold.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.360
He got into trouble.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.160
Yeah, that was a bad...

18:46.240 --> 18:46.840
-Thanks, Melanie.
-Thanks Melanie.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.520
We should do something for Jake.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.680
That's a good idea.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.760
Like a wake or something?

18:51.840 --> 18:52.760
Yeah.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.280
He would have liked that.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.960
Kegs and a DJ, two of
his favourite things.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.200
Look, I don't like to talk
ill of the dead

18:58.280 --> 19:00.600
but Jake was a prick.

19:00.680 --> 19:01.960
He thought he owned the cinema.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.200
Who knows how many people
he pissed off?

19:03.280 --> 19:05.120
Ok, he could be abrasive
at times

19:05.200 --> 19:07.160
but for the most part
he was funny as hell.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.960
He was a good guy, Mel.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.960
Why do you think I quit?

19:13.040 --> 19:15.560
Melanie, can you jump on cash?

19:26.080 --> 19:27.480

19:32.960 --> 19:34.240
Do you even know what's
in that sandwich

19:34.320 --> 19:36.040
or do you just order it
for the name?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.920
Why do you ask questions that
you already know the answer to?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.360
What'd I miss?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.800
Meg pulled a license plate
off the car in the background.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.240
You see that?

19:46.320 --> 19:49.400
It was registered in the 90's
to a guy named Phil Knowles.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.480
Guess what Phil did
for a living?

19:51.560 --> 19:53.240
He was a low budget
film producer.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.640
This image was pulled from
one of his production stills.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.600
She was an actress?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.240
In her old life.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.720
She had a small part in a B film
called "Alien Chase".

20:02.800 --> 20:06.400
Jake must have discovered it
in his work as a programmer.

20:06.480 --> 20:10.400
That, and her real name.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.920
What if they weren't
having an affair?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.960
What if Jake was
blackmailing her?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.680
That would be one hell of
a motive for her or Chris.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.680
Chen said if we wanna question
her, we need something concrete.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.120

20:25.640 --> 20:27.720
The police may want
to talk to you.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.880
I just needed you to know.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.360
I don't even know you.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.760
I'm still me.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.600
But before that I was
someone else.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.440
So you've just been lying to me
all these years?

20:36.520 --> 20:39.960
I was doing what I was told.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.040
I wanted to tell you
so many times,

20:43.120 --> 20:45.600
but I was afraid I was
gonna lose you.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.360
I'm tired of living this lie.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.840
Who did you testify against?

20:52.920 --> 20:55.760
Nikolay Kozlov.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.560
They offered me a deal to
either testify or go to prison.

20:58.640 --> 21:02.080
Why you?

21:02.160 --> 21:04.440
He was my husband.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.880
You're married?

21:05.960 --> 21:07.640
In my past life.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.080
So you being an only child,
your- your parents deceased,

21:10.160 --> 21:13.200
how far back do the lies go?

21:13.280 --> 21:14.320
Chris, I love you.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.760

hear it.

the premises.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.280
Piracy.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.920
Is this a joke?

21:35.000 --> 21:35.960
A distributor claimed
you screened an illegal copy

21:36.040 --> 21:38.560
of the film 24 Omega.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.000
Let's go.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.800
It's you and me then.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.320
Jake found out your real name
was Sonja Dresden,

21:54.400 --> 21:56.120
didn't he?

21:56.200 --> 22:00.840
To him it was blackmail but to
you it was the end of the world.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.960
I was an actress back then.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.840
Jake was always screening
obscure movies

22:05.920 --> 22:08.560
and then one day there was
my face staring back at us.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.800
But a different name
in the credits,

22:10.880 --> 22:12.600
which led him to discover
your first husband,

22:12.680 --> 22:14.600
crime boss Nikolay Kozlov.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.360
I thought he ran a restaurant.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.000
He had money.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.240
A lot of it.

22:26.320 --> 22:31.560
Whenever I'd ask about that
he'd tell me not to worry.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.520
I tried to ignore it.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.320
I just couldn't shake
the feeling

22:35.400 --> 22:37.680
that something was
horribly wrong.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.080
One night I had forgotten
something

22:43.160 --> 22:47.280
at the restaurant and stopped
by after hours.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.760
I saw them torturing a guy.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.440
I didn't know what to do.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.920
I was paralyzed.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.560
I confronted Nikolay...
and he turned on me.

23:03.640 --> 23:07.000
Fractured my jaw,
broke three ribs.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.960
It was a side of him
I'd never seen.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.960
I was afraid, and young.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.680
I felt trapped.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.040
Until federal agents approached
you and offered you a way out?

23:18.120 --> 23:19.360
Yes.

23:21.480 --> 23:25.080
At first Jake promised me
he would keep my secret.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.360
Swore that I was safe

23:27.440 --> 23:32.560
but over time he started
to use it against me.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.240
You should have told
your handler your identity

23:37.320 --> 23:38.840
was compromised.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.880
They would have relocated me.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.200
I'd never see Chris again and
I would have lost everything.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.760
So you had to kill Jake.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.960
It was self-defence.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.440
No.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.280
I would never have killed him.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.320
Do you have any idea what
it's like to lie to everyone?

23:52.400 --> 23:54.280
To never be able to just
tell the truth

23:54.360 --> 23:56.240
about what you've done?

23:56.320 --> 24:01.240
And then suddenly one person
knows the real you.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.800
You've got an 8mm editing
machine upstairs.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.920
It's Jake's.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.680
I need you to see something.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.960
Could have been what
the ketamine was for.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.760
Alicia insists she has no idea
these women were being filmed

24:43.840 --> 24:45.840
or who they are.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.840
Look at that floor.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.000
Let me see the photos
from Jake's house.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.880
That floor's a match to the one
in Jake's home.

25:00.960 --> 25:01.800
So what are they?

25:01.880 --> 25:02.920
Victims or conquests?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.360
They're out cold.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.000
My guess is he didn't go through
all that trouble

25:06.080 --> 25:07.920
to take their clothes off
just to photograph them.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.680
And whoever was
on that film strip,

25:09.760 --> 25:12.280
the killer was determined to get
rid of it with Jake's body.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.160
We need to start matching bodies
and faces.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.560
Great. So we can
I.D. his victims

25:15.640 --> 25:18.200
and start treating
them like suspects.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.040
Jake had over 900 friends.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.960
This could take a while.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.720
See the bracelet on number nine?

25:25.800 --> 25:26.920
Let's start there.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.560
Ok.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.560
Christine Hall.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.400
Look at the bracelet.

26:11.440 --> 26:15.600
That tattoo could be a match
for number four.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.680
Wait a second,
we know her.

26:25.760 --> 26:29.680
Yvonne Seo.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.640
She works concession
at the Cottonwood.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.040
There was nothing between us.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.720
Jake tried but I shut him down.

26:35.800 --> 26:36.720
Tried how?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.920
What do you mean by that?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.280
Even if it doesn't
seem important,

26:40.360 --> 26:43.200
any detail might help.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.520
We screened the movie The Fog
at one of his parties,

26:47.600 --> 26:51.040
ran out of popcorn so
he set up a makeshift bar

26:51.120 --> 26:55.800
and asked me what I'd give him
for a drink.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.360
And?

26:57.440 --> 27:00.440
I mean, he's my boss so
I told him I wasn't really

27:00.520 --> 27:03.960
into that in a joking way
so he knew we were still cool.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.920
He got it, backed off,
served me whatever I wanted.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.400
But then I woke up on
the projector room floor

27:15.480 --> 27:18.520
with no memory of
the night before.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.960
I was so stupid.

27:20.040 --> 27:23.280
I shouldn't have let myself
get that drunk.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.160
I need to show you something.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.040
It could be upsetting.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.080
Ok?

27:31.720 --> 27:33.920
Do you recognize this?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.720
Where did you get that?

27:41.800 --> 27:45.320
We found it in Jake's
possessions.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.320
I didn't wanna believe it.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.240
This was taken
without your consent?

27:50.320 --> 27:52.080
When I woke up everything
felt wrong.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.960
I just tried to forget it.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.080
I was warned about him.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.120
I should have never-

27:57.200 --> 28:00.480
Warned by who?

28:00.560 --> 28:02.480
Melanie Gram.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.760
She used to work here.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.840
We know Jake hurt
a lot of women.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.320
You wouldn't be the only one.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.240
Look, it's personal
and I took care of it.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.000
Took care of it or took care
of him?

28:21.080 --> 28:22.760
My life's pretty hard right now.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.800
Do you think I'd go and make
it worse by killing that creep?

28:24.880 --> 28:27.320
Well, maybe you knew
he was dangerous,

28:27.400 --> 28:28.960
and you were worried about
who else he might hurt.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.400
I'll tell you what I did.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.040
I quit the cinema and I loved
working there.

28:33.120 --> 28:36.280
Must have been pretty serious
for you to quit a job you loved.

28:36.360 --> 28:39.320
I've had guys cross
the line before.

28:39.400 --> 28:45.120
It makes you question
everything.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.120
I worked the late show one night
and no one showed up

28:48.200 --> 28:50.720
to the screening so Jake pulled
out a bottle of bourbon

28:50.800 --> 28:53.160
and we all did shots
while the film played out.

28:53.240 --> 28:56.280
Just a little fun.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.240
Next thing I know I'm waking up

28:58.320 --> 29:00.160
on the floor of
the projector booth.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.440
I knew something was wrong.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.600
I wasn't that drunk.

29:03.680 --> 29:04.880
You file a report?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.640
A report?

29:06.720 --> 29:09.440
The only reason you believe me
is because a guy is dead,

29:09.520 --> 29:13.560
and you think someone hated him
enough to kill him.

29:13.640 --> 29:17.280
I told Alicia and even
she didn't help me.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.480
Wait, Alicia knew?

29:32.360 --> 29:35.280
We know about Nikolay Kozlov.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.360
Do you know how much work
it takes to relocate someone?

29:37.440 --> 29:39.760
Not to mention the thousands
in tax payer money?

29:39.840 --> 29:42.400
So just walk away and pretend
we never had this conversation.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.480
We got a media scrum at 4:00pm.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.960
I'm dropping names if you
don't give me something

29:46.040 --> 29:47.120
to rule her out.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.760
She's not a killer.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.120
She likes her comfort
and she wouldn't risk that.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.840
The victim knew her identity.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.240
That's reason enough
for Alicia to murder Jake.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.280
What're you talking about?

29:56.360 --> 29:57.280
Jake Merridew.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.040
He was blackmailing her.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.560
Another employee said
that Jake raped her,

30:00.640 --> 30:02.720
Alicia covered it up.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.000
From where I'm standing

30:04.080 --> 30:05.760
it sounds like she's
kinda desperate.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.600
After what she experienced,
the abuse from her husband,

30:07.680 --> 30:09.000
the threats,
what makes you think

30:09.080 --> 30:11.080
that she can't escalate
to murder?

30:11.160 --> 30:12.040
[laughs]

30:12.120 --> 30:13.320
Is that what she said?

30:13.400 --> 30:14.800
That she's a victim
of her husband?

30:14.880 --> 30:16.560
Not the full story,
I take it.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.920
Alicia's the kind of person
to take the easiest way out.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.960
She was up to her neck in that
business and she knew exactly

30:21.040 --> 30:22.960
what her husband was doing.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.680
Look, I wouldn't believe
anything she says

30:24.760 --> 30:27.960
but I'm telling you,
she's not good for this.

30:28.040 --> 30:31.080
There's no way she would
get her hands dirty.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.320
How much did Jake blackmail
from you?

30:37.400 --> 30:38.440
$30,000.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.320
$30,000?

30:40.400 --> 30:41.360
What were you thinking?

30:41.440 --> 30:44.680
I did it for us.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.360
I love you, Chris.

30:47.440 --> 30:51.240
Love isn't enough.

30:51.320 --> 30:52.280
I don't see a way through this.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.960
I'm sorry.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.840
New theory.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.760
Can't trust Alicia as far as
we can throw her.

31:02.840 --> 31:06.440
If that's true then everything
is back on the table.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.840
We start with the most important
part of the statement.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.720
Her alibi.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.000
Worked late with Brody.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.720
He verified it.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.680
Let's look into Brody, see
if he was covering for her.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.240
He was effusive about Jake.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.560
Hey, I got this weird message
on my phone...

31:22.640 --> 31:24.400
you ever get any anonymous tips

31:24.480 --> 31:26.000
or anything like that
to your cell?

31:26.080 --> 31:27.680
Sure, yeah.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.240
I give out my card to someone,
it gets passed around.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.760
This Brody kid's been working
at the Cottonwood a while.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.120
Three years.

31:38.520 --> 31:39.480
Nolan.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.480
Brody's dating Melanie.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.320
Melanie, who told Alicia
about the sexual assault.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.080
And if she told Brody I can only
imagine how he'd react.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.840
It could explain why she's
missing from the home movies,

31:53.920 --> 31:56.120
because you know Jake
would've filmed her.

31:56.200 --> 32:00.760
Her film strip was meant
to disappear with Jake.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.680
Brody's not the one
covering for Alicia.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.360
She's covering for him.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.960
Your alibi, working late
with Brody, didn't stick.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.280
So who are you covering for?

32:20.360 --> 32:21.680
Him or you?

32:21.760 --> 32:23.600
Whatever happened
between Brody and Jake,

32:23.680 --> 32:25.560
I had nothing to do with that.

32:25.640 --> 32:29.960
We know Melanie confided in you
about Jake assaulting her.

32:30.040 --> 32:34.000
Sounds like you had plenty
to do with it.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.560
I can't connect Brody
to an oil drum purchase

32:42.640 --> 32:45.560
but I found another Andrews that
works out of that warehouse.

32:45.640 --> 32:46.760
Relative?

32:46.840 --> 32:48.360
I'm looking into it.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.960
I miss the old fashioned cases.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.920
Couple of bullets traced back
to a gun,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.520
maybe some gun shot residue
thrown in for good measure...

32:54.600 --> 32:58.080
How did you not die of boredom?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.680
We do have residue.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.280
The driver.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.840
He was upset about his shoes.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.440
We found trace amounts
of sulphuric acid

33:14.520 --> 33:16.800
on the bottom of your shoes.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.040
So?

33:18.120 --> 33:19.520
I walked through a puddle.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.240
We know Melanie was
one of Jake's victims.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.560
That must have been hard for you
to swallow.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.200
Dude, I told you
to stop doing this.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.280
It's an art film.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.720
Yeah, you keep saying that.

33:42.680 --> 33:43.600
Woah.

33:43.680 --> 33:44.600
What the hell?

33:44.680 --> 33:45.240
It's hot, right?

33:45.320 --> 33:46.280
No.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.280
You asshole, that's Melanie.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.280
Relax.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.160
You weren't together then.

33:49.240 --> 33:49.880
Why didn't you tell me?

33:49.960 --> 33:50.800
It was ages ago.

33:50.880 --> 33:51.640
I forgot it happened.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.240
Did you drug her?

33:52.320 --> 33:53.600
Woah.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.000
Chill out, man.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.440
You have no problem
selling me the K,

33:56.520 --> 33:57.520
don't act like you don't know
what it's for.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.960
How could you do that to her?

33:59.040 --> 34:01.360
She was all over me.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.200
Hey!

34:02.280 --> 34:03.480
Woah, woah, woah!

34:03.560 --> 34:04.560
Let's be clear about
something here.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.800
We're in this together.

34:05.880 --> 34:06.840
I have nothing to do
with this!

34:06.920 --> 34:08.320
No, you just make money from it.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.600
You sold me the drugs,
I film the girls,

34:10.680 --> 34:12.040
we both enjoy the footage.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.680
I'm sure you don't want Melanie
to find out

34:13.760 --> 34:15.760
about your little
side hustle here.

34:15.840 --> 34:21.440
So you say anything,
she's my first call.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.240
Guess who the resident drug
dealer was at the Cottonwood?

34:29.320 --> 34:33.320
Provided ecstasy
for all their parties?

34:38.360 --> 34:44.040
Who's idea was it to drug Jake,
yours or Brody's?

34:44.120 --> 34:46.120
After everything you've
sacrificed to stay out of prison

34:46.200 --> 34:51.320
are you really gonna let
this guy take you down?

34:51.400 --> 34:53.720
Chris left me.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.680
There's nothing you can threaten
me with now.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.720
I'm sorry to hear that.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.360
But don't throw
your life away

35:02.440 --> 35:04.920
just because you feel
like you don't deserve one.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.360
I had no idea what Brody
was planning,

35:11.440 --> 35:12.560
but I could tell there was
something off

35:12.640 --> 35:14.080
with him that night.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.120
Brody.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.120
Jake left his keys
on the counter.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.800
What's wrong with him?

35:27.880 --> 35:31.040
Oh, he... he had too much
to drink.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.200
Where are we going?

35:32.280 --> 35:35.080
I'm gonna get him home safe.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.120
Then don't you need these?

35:37.200 --> 35:40.800
Uh, probably.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.440
Does this have to do
with Melanie?

35:51.520 --> 35:53.400
Oh, Sonja.

35:54.960 --> 36:02.120
So pretty.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.480
Get him out of here.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.360
I could tell that he was
gonna get even,

36:21.440 --> 36:25.080
I just didn't know how.

36:25.160 --> 36:29.240
When I heard Jake was dead
I was relieved.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.720
So you alibied Brody.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.600
Yes.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.960
But I didn't kill Jake.

36:36.040 --> 36:41.160
You looked the other way, and
then you helped cover it up.

36:41.240 --> 36:45.000
That makes you an accessory
after the fact.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.840
It wasn't my business
what he did.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.600
Well, that's a nice story,
but you enabled him.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.720
Fostered the perfect storm
for him and your girl.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.160
You gotta really hate yourself.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.720
I couldn't let him drag me
into that.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.320
So you figured you'd stash
an oil drum

36:58.400 --> 36:59.920
where your cousin works,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.120
ship Jake across the country
never to be seen again.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.240
I wasn't gonna go down
for what he did.

37:04.320 --> 37:09.400
He was gonna say I was involved.

37:09.480 --> 37:14.160
That's because you were.

37:21.520 --> 37:25.680
♪ Well, I was there
and I saw what you did,♪

37:25.760 --> 37:29.920
♪ I saw it with my own
two eyes,♪

37:30.000 --> 37:32.480
♪ So you can wipe off
that grin,♪

37:32.560 --> 37:34.760
♪ I know where you've been,♪

37:34.840 --> 37:40.000

37:46.080 --> 37:49.080
♪ Oh lord,♪

37:49.160 --> 37:55.000
♪ And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life,

37:55.080 --> 37:58.400

37:58.480 --> 38:04.080

38:04.160 --> 38:08.960
♪ Oh lord,♪

38:16.440 --> 38:17.440
What're you still doing here?

38:17.520 --> 38:20.840
Not gonna wrap itself.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.960
I don't wanna hear
about you waking up

38:24.040 --> 38:26.760
in the back of a squad
car again.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.600
Understood.

38:29.680 --> 38:32.080
And I didn't hear it from Kate,
either.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.000
She covered for you.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.440
Abby's making
her lasagne tonight.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.600
Look, I know your marriage
problems can't be easy.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.480
Come on over and take your mind
off things.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.520
I gotta get through this.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.480
It can wait.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.520
It was the lasagne, right?

38:55.600 --> 38:56.440
You just can't say no.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.080
Can't say no.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.960
Hey.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.760
You ready?

39:14.840 --> 39:17.280
Yeah.

39:20.120 --> 39:25.000
I had to bail my partner out
of something this week.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.080
I probably shouldn't be talking
to you about Nolan.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.600
This is a safe place, Kate.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.200
Whatever you share with me
is protected

39:30.280 --> 39:32.000
by client confidentiality.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.800
Nolan making your job difficult?

39:35.880 --> 39:38.280
No.

39:38.360 --> 39:42.320
If anything, seeing him
like this makes him more human.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.080
It's tough to let someone see us
when we're struggling.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.440
It takes real courage.

39:46.520 --> 39:51.920
I see you sitting on this couch
and that takes courage.

39:59.160 --> 40:07.800
Um... I made a mistake
my first week in homicide.

40:07.880 --> 40:12.680
I left my firearm on the back
seat of the cruiser.

40:12.760 --> 40:17.200
Someone broke in,
stole the gun.

40:17.280 --> 40:25.920
It was later found at a murder.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.480
My partner wanted to protect me
and tried to cover it up.

40:29.560 --> 40:33.360
Detective Michael Huntley
tried to protect you

40:33.440 --> 40:35.480
the way you're protecting Nolan?

40:35.560 --> 40:37.320
This was different.

40:37.400 --> 40:43.120
He planted evidence
on our lead suspect.

40:43.200 --> 40:48.880
That's why we were at the
apartment the night he died.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.400
All because of my mistake.

40:58.160 --> 41:01.080
I got him killed.

41:01.160 --> 41:08.200
I'm the reason he died.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.800
Ok.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.960
That we should talk about.
