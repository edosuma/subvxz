01:24.667 --> 01:29.214
<i>I thought I'd start by telling you
a quintessential Dorothy Walker story</i>

01:29.297 --> 01:32.425
<i>about how she pushed me
to get a particular job</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:35.720
<i>on a sitcom called </i> That's Our Girl.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.723
I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.559
They might
actually serve that here.

01:41.643 --> 01:45.355
I ordered beef brisket,
not Seabiscuit.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.399
How can you be hungry anyway?
We just had snacks.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.277
This is the meal between snacks and lunch.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.529
I call it snunch.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.907
And yet you're so thin.
What's your secret?

01:55.990 --> 01:57.534
Crippling anxiety.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.452
You're ten.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.039
And I'll never see nine again.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.835
No! Throw it away.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.211
But...

02:08.294 --> 02:10.338
the parenthetical says "dramatic."

02:10.420 --> 02:13.424
What did I tell you about parentheticals?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.634
"Cross 'em out."

02:14.717 --> 02:19.514
Every girl is gonna be doing
a goddamn fake swoon.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.891
Find something else.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.561
Look at me, Pats.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.939
We have sold everything
down to the floorboards,

02:28.022 --> 02:31.442
and your dad's child support
barely covers our groceries.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.069
- I know.
- Do you?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.363
Because I'm not seeing
a serious effort here!

02:42.203 --> 02:43.580
I can't do this for you.

02:44.747 --> 02:45.999
It's all on you.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.710
Tell me you've got this.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.797
I've got this.

02:58.636 --> 02:59.637
Again.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.183
<i>Jess! Jess!</i>

03:04.225 --> 03:06.603
He killed her. He killed her.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.563
- She's dead.
<i>- Trish...</i>

03:08.646 --> 03:09.647
Oh, my God.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.483
- He did this!
- <i>I'm on my way.</i>

03:13.484 --> 03:16.404
<i>I'm leaving right now.
I'm gonna be right there.</i>

03:16.988 --> 03:20.491
<i>Trish? Trish, are you there?</i>

03:20.575 --> 03:21.701
It doesn't matter.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.709
- He has to pay.
- <i>Yes, and he will. Okay?</i>

03:39.177 --> 03:40.678
I've got this.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.705
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you a resident?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.208
Where's Jessica?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.339
Oh.

04:59.173 --> 05:00.550
I should have known.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.430
You didn't need the light.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.779
Is that what my mother sounded like?
Did you give a shit?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.612
Trish! Trish, stop!

06:29.097 --> 06:30.139
It's real...

06:31.474 --> 06:32.517
isn't it?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.355
She's gone.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.442
Jess...

06:43.528 --> 06:44.695
she's dead.

06:51.953 --> 06:52.954
Come here.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.846
<i>You are who you are
because of Dorothy.</i>

07:10.596 --> 07:12.056
I've gotta give her that.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.444
Costa.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.823
How's it playing out?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.371
<i>...this violent offender ourselves.</i>

07:35.455 --> 07:40.001
<i>Hogarth & Associates is prepared
to offer a $250,000 reward</i>

07:40.084 --> 07:44.630
<i>for the successful identification
of the vigilante plaguing our streets.</i>

07:45.923 --> 07:48.551
<i>I will unmask you.</i>

07:48.634 --> 07:52.013
<i>And in doing so, I will lead
the charge to take back our city</i>

07:52.096 --> 07:55.141
<i>from those who consider themselves
above the law.</i>

07:56.684 --> 07:57.935
<i>Questions, anyone?</i>

08:01.397 --> 08:02.815
I need to go check on something.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.776
- Did Sallinger ID me?
- That's what I need to find out.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.905
- I can't just sit here and do nothing.
- You have to.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.490
Just until I get some answers.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.034
Just, please, don't go anywhere.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.254
It's like an infestation.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.259
- Her hair is so red, though.
- Just pay them no mind.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.139
Everybody's blonde
except for her.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.475
The breakdown says Vicki's blonde.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.143
Yeah, well...

08:40.102 --> 08:42.020
the show's EP is Devlin Hoskins.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.563
Hair like an orangutan.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.443
Now, a cattle call
is about catching someone's eye.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.320
Nothing catches the eye like a mirror.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.493
There. Look at you.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.079
You look like he could have
made you himself.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.749
I need those.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.214
The line ends back there.

09:08.297 --> 09:09.924
She tore her sides.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.181
Don't smile. Look interesting.

09:18.849 --> 09:19.849
Dev!

09:20.810 --> 09:23.104
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.857
Dorothy Walker. We've met.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.901
This is Patsy.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.487
- I believe we're next.
- No, there's a long line...

09:31.571 --> 09:34.323
The red hair. Is that yours?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.576
Sure is.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.786
She paid good money for it.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.833
- You wanna come on in?
- Uh, excuse me!

09:43.916 --> 09:46.377
Hey! We've been waiting
way longer than you.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.628
You're cutting!

09:48.212 --> 09:49.839
Didn't she just walk in?

09:54.594 --> 09:57.054
I told you what would happen
if you saw him again!

09:57.138 --> 10:00.433
I told you a thousand times,
you lying whore!

10:00.516 --> 10:01.517
You're wrong!

10:01.601 --> 10:03.561
I didn't sleep with him!

10:03.644 --> 10:04.645
Put that down!

10:07.648 --> 10:09.692
This is your goddamn fault!

10:09.775 --> 10:11.615
You always do these things!

10:11.652 --> 10:13.696
You're goddamn selfish,
that's what you are!

10:13.779 --> 10:17.825
I take care of you, I provide for you,
and this is what you give me?

10:17.908 --> 10:20.411
I don't belong to you!

10:21.829 --> 10:22.829
Hey.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.500
Jessica thought
you might need some clothes.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.046
Uh...

10:41.015 --> 10:42.600
Nice digs.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.437
The best places to hide out
are the places no one else wants to go.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.862
Look, I'm so sorry.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.447
I know you blame yourself.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.075
It's not your fault.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.371
I know. It's Sallinger's fault.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.165
Despite everything on my side...

11:06.248 --> 11:07.750
...the good,

11:07.833 --> 11:10.211
the right, they still win. God damn it!

11:10.294 --> 11:13.005
- I'll go over there and see...
- No, don't... Don't. Um...

11:14.965 --> 11:16.467
- I'm hiding out.
- Right.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.678
Uh...

11:20.054 --> 11:21.597
They don't always.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.141
Win. They don't always win.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.563
They do enough
that I can't do this anymore.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.778
Good.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.738
Uh, was there anything else?

11:38.906 --> 11:39.907
No.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.742
I hope it helps.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.511
The hell you doin' in here?

12:01.512 --> 12:02.680
Was I bothering you?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.016
Because your wife beating
was bothering me.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.936
She ain't my wife.
And she got what she was asked for.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.235
No, no, no.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.078
Jess, where have you been?

12:45.514 --> 12:47.266
What the hell is he doing here?

12:47.349 --> 12:50.394
I wanted to look you in the eye
and explain... to make things right.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.271
You want me to absolve you

12:52.354 --> 12:54.231
for the fact my mother is dead

12:54.315 --> 12:56.251
because you're a goddamn coward!

12:56.275 --> 12:58.903
Jesus. Trish... Jesus.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.572
I can take a hit...

13:01.655 --> 13:02.698
when it's righteous.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.617
You don't deserve my forgiveness.

13:08.537 --> 13:09.538
I know.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.214
You have no idea
what he did for you tonight.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.675
All right, what did he do?

13:30.976 --> 13:32.061
It's Gelden.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.398
I need a game. Any game.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.695
Sallinger wanted me
to destroy the evidence

13:41.779 --> 13:44.031
that proved he killed Nathan Silva.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.574
No.

13:46.867 --> 13:50.663
- No. No, no, no.
- It was the only way to protect you.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.331
I told you I would go to jail!

13:53.123 --> 13:55.501
<i>Gladly, if it meant killing him.</i>

13:55.584 --> 13:58.337
<i>All that matters is nailing Sallinger.</i>

14:30.494 --> 14:33.581
You here to see Mr. Sallinger?
He's not receiving visitors.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.333
I was just passing by.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.836
It's all right.
Let her through.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.388
I made a deal with your sister.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.473
But not with me.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.976
You won't get very far.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.812
Not with our friends from the force
out there.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.817
I'm not afraid of jail.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.570
How about a bullet to the head?
You afraid of that?

15:05.613 --> 15:08.991
That's what cops do to people
that assault two of their officers.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.916
They won't protect you forever.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.297
It tortured your sister
to do what she did to save you.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.343
In vain, obviously,
if you murder me anyways.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.012
It's not murder. It's justice.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.138
You're a liar.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.974
You kill because it
makes you feel powerful.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.059
No, that's your MO.

15:35.142 --> 15:38.896
- No. It's a byproduct of my work.
- Your work?

15:39.939 --> 15:42.524
You mean those torture-porn pictures?

15:50.074 --> 15:53.702
Clearly, you haven't seen
my latest achievement yet.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.668
Seriously.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.421
I left it in the most obvious of places.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.591
You'll find it very...

16:08.842 --> 16:09.842
honest.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.470
I know I did.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.157
I'm sorry, ma'am.
This is still a crime scene.

16:33.117 --> 16:36.036
I just... need to get something...

16:37.037 --> 16:38.038
of hers.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.749
To remind me.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.046
Okay.

17:20.705 --> 17:21.999
<i>It's a good role.</i>

17:22.790 --> 17:25.544
You should've told him to wait
and talk to me.

17:25.627 --> 17:29.465
Okay. But it's good.
The best friend, named Surprise.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.092
The show is called <i>That's Our Girl,</i>

17:32.176 --> 17:34.386
not <i>What the Hell Kind of a Name
Is Surprise?</i>

17:34.470 --> 17:37.347
It says in the script that her parents
weren't planning on having...

17:37.431 --> 17:40.768
I get the joke. Ha-ha. Who got the lead?

17:40.851 --> 17:44.271
Carrie Leigh Hirsch.
She has way more experience than me.

17:44.813 --> 17:49.318
Experience is not the same thing
as talent.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.987
You weren't born to be a best friend.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.616
A best friend is a sidekick. It's nothing.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.036
When is the table read?

17:59.119 --> 18:03.415
There isn't gonna be one.
Carrie Leigh's getting over chicken pox.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.751
Meant to be.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.629
Here's what you do. Call them.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.757
Say you know how writers
like to hear the jokes out loud.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.677
Offer to help out and read the lead,
just for the table.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.889
That's... I don't...

18:20.307 --> 18:21.308
I don't want to.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.351
Ow!

18:24.478 --> 18:27.564
You take that holier-than-Mom look
off your face.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.984
You know you haven't done
everything you can to get that part.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.861
Now, you star 69 them.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.554
Oh.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.015
Oh, Mother.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.333
Ms. Walker?

19:29.418 --> 19:30.419
Omar.

19:30.794 --> 19:34.256
I'm so sorry. She was a great lady.
It happened on my watch.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.800
There's nothing you could've done.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.844
There's always something we can do.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.556
Satan wins
when the forces of light stand idly by.

19:45.851 --> 19:46.894
Thank you, Omar.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.360
Oh, I thought you were someone else.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.613
Just me.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.991
The first hit, I deserved it.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.203
Second one, I'm gonna put up a fight.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.122
You said you wished
you could make it right.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.833
I have a way you can do that.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.338
Can I offer you something to, uh...

20:14.421 --> 20:16.506
You, uh, blackmail guilty people.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.594
- Well, I'm rethinking that career path.
- What if you could put them away?

20:21.386 --> 20:22.596
You wanna catch a bad guy.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.724
I wanna pay a debt.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.643
You wanna go after Sallinger.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.897
Yes, but there are other assholes
who can and will hurt people,

20:31.980 --> 20:33.398
and you know who they are.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.442
Yeah, there's a never-ending supply.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.946
Maybe I can save a life, or lives,
by taking them down.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.994
Someone came to mind, didn't they?

20:46.578 --> 20:48.288
When I said you know who they are.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.293
Maybe the same person who you wanted
to pummel when you opened the door.

20:57.297 --> 21:01.301
A dirty cop.
I blackmailed him a while ago.

21:01.385 --> 21:05.055
More recently, Jessica and I
have pissed him off a bit.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.765
What's he guilty of?

21:08.684 --> 21:10.269
Killing some drug dealers.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.854
He killed bad people?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.064
Kids.

21:14.147 --> 21:17.359
Poor kids,
who still had a chance to change.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.194
And he did it to steal their money.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.488
- Do you have proof?
- A file full.

21:21.571 --> 21:26.785
Intel from illegal immigrants, ex-cons,
snitches, none of whom will testify.

21:26.868 --> 21:27.869
All inadmissible.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.246
But you know it's real.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.749
Nussbaumer paid me off. Twice.
It says it all.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.085
If we can get him to admit it on video...

21:35.168 --> 21:36.728
- It won't hold up.
- It doesn't matter.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.798
I would put it online.
It could trigger an investigation.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.889
I know it costs you,
but you can see into people.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.516
You've seen into this cop.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.143
If he kills another kid,

21:51.226 --> 21:54.062
you will be the only person on earth
who saw it coming.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.565
He won't talk.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.526
Oh, God! Just give me the file.
I'll confront him with it.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.403
You don't have to be involved.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.113
Will Jessica?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.157
No.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.201
I owe this.

22:09.619 --> 22:13.415
So I'm supposed to let you face off
with a murderer alone?

22:13.498 --> 22:15.751
- I'm powered, too.
- But he's armed.

22:15.834 --> 22:19.171
If you get hurt chasing my bad guy,
Jessica's gonna kick my face in.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.631
- And I'll let her.
- Jessica is not my mother!

22:27.304 --> 22:28.972
I have to do something good.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.351
Something to counteract
all of this hideousness.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.771
Something only I can do. Okay?

22:43.945 --> 22:45.280
Well, I'm coming with you.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.534
He won't talk to you,
you come at him with a camera phone.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.748
Pick an isolated place.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.334
Get Nussbaumer to meet you there.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.921
Oh, you mean now?

23:06.426 --> 23:08.637
And I guess that's what I learned today.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.349
That it doesn't matter if you're a lion
or a mouse...

23:13.141 --> 23:14.768
or a runaway class turtle

23:14.851 --> 23:17.979
that just couldn't take one more day
of the fourth grade.

23:21.358 --> 23:26.613
What matters is being the bravest version
of you that you can be.

24:02.732 --> 24:03.733
He's here.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.696
And judging from the pain,
he's not happy about the third bribe.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.050
You got a death wish, Gelden?

24:31.845 --> 24:35.307
Yeah, I know all about you, Erik Gelden!

24:35.390 --> 24:39.269
Where you live, where you gamble,
where you went wrong!

24:40.437 --> 24:45.192
David Corderas, age 16.
Shot in the back of the head.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.819
Jessica Jones?

24:49.029 --> 24:50.489
I know you, too.

24:51.072 --> 24:54.409
Rui Avedo, 14. Hit and run.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.413
Marquel Booker, 19.
Again, shot in the head.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.624
Dealing drugs is a dangerous gig.

25:01.416 --> 25:05.045
Aaron Martinez, 21.
Accidental overdose.

25:06.254 --> 25:07.964
Look, I got no beef with you,

25:08.048 --> 25:10.634
just the criminal
you're aiding and abetting.

25:10.717 --> 25:11.760
Gelden!

25:11.843 --> 25:14.930
You paid him off
because you killed those boys.

25:15.514 --> 25:19.809
It wasn't a payoff.
I executed a sting to catch a blackmailer.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.103
But he got away.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.272
Until now.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.072
Who the hell are you?

25:32.781 --> 25:35.450
All that stolen drug money,
you donated to charity, right?

25:35.534 --> 25:39.120
Generally speaking,
the people who die deserve it.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.389
Tyrone DeGrasse.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.309
Nineteen.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.145
Died in the back of your squad car.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.357
I did the taxpayers a favor.

26:08.149 --> 26:09.568
We got what we need.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.612
Shit.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.079
You don't deserve this.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.919
Oh, shit.

26:33.049 --> 26:35.176
Shit. Oh, my God.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.179
Um, we should, uh...
We should...

26:38.263 --> 26:40.765
- Call someone?
- Yeah. Uh...

26:46.938 --> 26:48.148
Oh, no.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.504
No. No, no, no, no, no.

26:53.528 --> 26:55.196
This wasn't supposed to happen.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.367
Sorry. Inappropriate.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.577
No, I didn't want...

27:00.660 --> 27:03.079
I didn't want this. Ugh.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.665
The pain...

27:07.042 --> 27:08.335
The pain is gone.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.963
In my... my head. It's... It's like the...

27:12.964 --> 27:15.216
the world just changed.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.011
It's lighter. It's...

27:20.180 --> 27:23.600
It's better. And I can feel it.

27:29.564 --> 27:30.607
We gotta go.

27:36.529 --> 27:40.450
We can start going over the details
and fill her in later.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.243
No. She's on her way.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.664
Well, I just need to reschedule
my next appointment.

27:47.248 --> 27:49.417
- Sorry.
- I'll be back.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.020
Oh, my God.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.651
What person of interest?

28:15.985 --> 28:16.986
Shit.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.784
Sorry I'm late.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.038
Are you okay?

28:29.124 --> 28:30.250
I don't know.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.275
Trish Walker?

28:56.568 --> 29:00.321
Detectives Imada and Defford.
We're very sorry for your loss.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.115
Thank you.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.758
We know how hard it can be
when you don't have answers.

29:04.784 --> 29:07.287
The answer is Gregory Sallinger.
He should be charged...

29:07.370 --> 29:09.122
We're not here in regard to that matter.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.750
We spoke to your sister earlier
about a case we're investigating

29:11.833 --> 29:15.253
- involving the death of a police officer.
- She didn't mention it.

29:15.336 --> 29:17.016
We have some questions
she couldn't answer.

29:17.088 --> 29:21.384
We're hoping you can fill in some blanks.
For example, how fast does she heal?

29:23.261 --> 29:24.471
Uh...

29:24.554 --> 29:27.432
I don't... Normal fast. Not too fast.

29:28.016 --> 29:31.686
- Wait. Jessica is your person of interest?
- We're looking at everyone, ma'am.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.272
- Well, Jessica didn't do it.
- And you know this because?

29:34.355 --> 29:38.067
Because I know her.
She would never kill a cop for no reason.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.631
What reason would she need?

29:40.361 --> 29:42.906
Well, I guess...
innocent until proven guilty,

29:42.989 --> 29:45.283
what, it only applies
to serial killers now?

29:45.366 --> 29:47.286
We're trying to fill in
some blanks in her story.

29:47.327 --> 29:49.496
- No, you're trying to pin it on her.
- They won't.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.666
What are you...

29:53.750 --> 29:56.002
The cops think Jessica killed Nussbaumer.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.296
What?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.716
- Did you just wake up? It's seven o'clock.
- Night owl.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.718
You and Jess are well-matched.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.012
They think Jessica did it?

30:06.596 --> 30:08.681
- That's bullshit.
- Of course it is.

30:08.765 --> 30:12.811
Shit. Nussbaumer's body cam was on.
They must have seen Jessica confront him.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.938
We can't let her get blamed for this.

30:15.021 --> 30:17.440
I should have made sure
she had a goddamn alibi.

30:17.524 --> 30:20.360
- Shit. Shit. Shit.
- Okay...

30:21.736 --> 30:22.987
Okay... Shit.

30:23.571 --> 30:24.697
Wait. What if...

30:25.448 --> 30:26.699
What if?

30:27.283 --> 30:30.620
What if Nussbaumer's killer
hits someone else?

30:30.703 --> 30:33.540
- I'm not gonna kill someone else.
- Not kill.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.875
Just rough up another bad guy.

30:36.751 --> 30:38.127
What bad guy?

30:38.211 --> 30:40.672
I don't know. I got a box full of 'em.

30:40.755 --> 30:44.759
But we'll time it so Jessica
is someplace visible when it happens.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.095
And then you tell him
that you also did Nussbaumer.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.263
And then he tells the cops.

30:48.346 --> 30:51.891
Jess gets an alibi.
We take down another asshole.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.394
Of course, when our mark says

30:54.477 --> 30:57.105
the masked vigilante
attacked him and Nussbaumer...

30:58.189 --> 31:02.068
Jessica's gonna know what you...
what we did.

31:02.151 --> 31:04.863
It was my fault.
I'll make sure she knows it.

31:04.946 --> 31:08.449
Because right now...
she thinks you did it.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.828
Christ. This is so dicked up.

31:11.911 --> 31:16.416
Hey, you didn't do this.
Just make sure she knows it.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.042
"Just"?

31:18.793 --> 31:21.254
Look, Jess and I...

31:23.172 --> 31:24.465
we've lost too much.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.886
I don't want her to lose you, too.

31:35.852 --> 31:36.853
Well...

31:37.395 --> 31:38.395
uh...

31:38.855 --> 31:40.023
neither do I.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.486
I'll go find us another asshole.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.126
What are they talking about?

32:01.586 --> 32:03.212
They're gonna offer us the lead.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.965
No way. I did it?

32:06.049 --> 32:07.508
Ooh, ooh... Ow!

32:07.592 --> 32:10.219
Act like a goddamn adult.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.139
You're number one on the call sheet now.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.934
You have to lead by example.

32:17.477 --> 32:18.561
How?

32:18.645 --> 32:21.230
You help the other actors.

32:21.314 --> 32:24.317
And you let them know
you notice if they're unprepared.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.653
You set the tone and land the jokes.

32:27.403 --> 32:32.241
A hundred people could have jobs
on this show, for years.

32:32.951 --> 32:37.789
But they only feed their families
if you do your job perfectly every day.

32:40.708 --> 32:46.005
I just wanted to play the part.
I didn't know it... It sounds hard.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.674
Well, it is hard.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.887
But there's no backing out now.
You owe this.

32:55.056 --> 32:58.184
Oh, Pats.

33:00.269 --> 33:03.189
I understand how this is daunting.

33:05.358 --> 33:09.862
But if you don't do it,
you are being selfish.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.907
Because I owe you?

33:14.450 --> 33:18.579
No.
You don't owe me, baby girl.

33:20.581 --> 33:22.709
You owe the world.

33:23.459 --> 33:27.547
It gave you a gift.
You have to give it back.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.802
All right, now. Now look surprised.

33:32.885 --> 33:36.514
Patsy, I have some big news.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.989
He spends most of his time
in that trailer over there.

33:54.490 --> 33:55.658
Jace Montero?

33:57.368 --> 33:59.787
I blackmailed him a few years ago.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.081
The headache he gave me
nearly put me in the hospital.

34:02.165 --> 34:06.169
- He's a developer?
- And an arsonist. Repeat offender.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.255
That used to be a landmark building.
Went up in flames.

34:10.339 --> 34:12.925
Freed 'em up to build
whatever monstrosity he wants.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.761
People died.

34:15.344 --> 34:18.889
Yeah, twelve that I know of.
In three different buildings he owned.

34:19.556 --> 34:22.018
Some squatters, a firefighter...

34:23.061 --> 34:24.771
No one's been able to pin it on him.

34:24.853 --> 34:27.231
And he just bought
an old building in Queens.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.859
Bet that burns down, too.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.820
Wow. This guy is really evil.

34:34.030 --> 34:38.159
What you can do... it's kind of amazing.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.368
Thank you?

34:40.786 --> 34:42.163
You could change the world.

34:42.996 --> 34:44.873
I just want an alibi for Jess.

34:45.875 --> 34:46.876
And then?

34:48.503 --> 34:49.795
A lobotomy?

34:51.547 --> 34:52.547
I don't know.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.134
I don't know, Trish. I don't.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.679
You know you can help people.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.683
You won't be able
to walk away from that now.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.646
That's him.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.050
We have to make sure
that Jess is someplace public.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.137
And until then...

35:42.515 --> 35:43.515
we go to a funeral.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.873
You did it, Pats!

36:06.956 --> 36:09.333
The head of programming was here.
He flipped!

36:09.417 --> 36:12.170
You're TGIF, baby girl.

36:12.253 --> 36:13.754
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.965
Congratulations, Patsy. Good show.

36:16.048 --> 36:20.928
There's nothing official yet,
but ABC knows a hit when they see it.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.096
Oh, fantastic!

36:23.181 --> 36:25.099
And you're changing the title, right?

36:25.183 --> 36:26.309
What?

36:26.392 --> 36:28.519
Oh, sorry. I heard the network talking.

36:28.603 --> 36:32.732
I mean, you changed the character's name
to Patsy, which is perfect, of course.

36:32.815 --> 36:36.986
I guess <i>That's Our Girl</i>
seems a little generic to them.

36:37.069 --> 36:40.323
Assholes. I told them that last week.

36:40.406 --> 36:45.870
Well, maybe it's just a little tweak.
Like... <i>That's Our Patsy!</i>

36:45.953 --> 36:49.457
Or... <i>Here's Patsy.</i> That might pop.

36:49.957 --> 36:52.752
Hmm. We'll see how it shakes out.

36:52.835 --> 36:53.836
Okay.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.929
I am so proud of you.

37:48.224 --> 37:51.060
Uh, Jess! You're a little early.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.399
You've been ignoring your calls.

37:57.566 --> 38:01.279
I'm ignoring your calls.
Our business relationship is over.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.364
- In its current form.
- In any form.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.953
- I know.
- You know what?

38:09.036 --> 38:12.248
I know that I can help you...
if you help me.

38:12.331 --> 38:16.168
- In what world would I ever help you?
- In this world.

38:38.149 --> 38:42.320
You've been stealing my files,
assaulting my clients.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.946
Your criminal clients.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.532
Who will sue you
for every penny that you have.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.603
Money that you will need
if the DA decides to prosecute you

38:49.660 --> 38:54.165
for assaulting those two police officers,
maiming Sallinger. All felony offenses.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.377
I'm about to bury my mother
because of you.

38:59.879 --> 39:02.131
I will destroy the footage...

39:03.174 --> 39:07.553
in exchange for a favor
that requires your gifts.

39:08.095 --> 39:10.181
I need you to steal something
from someone.

39:10.264 --> 39:11.682
Someone other than me.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.643
A man named Demetri Patseras.

39:15.853 --> 39:19.899
Patseras is trying to hurt someone
that I care about.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.568
He's a bad person.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.196
That's who you go after now, isn't it?

39:34.538 --> 39:38.042
I'll send you the specifics...
after the funeral.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.630
I do go after bad people.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.716
Remember that.

40:27.758 --> 40:28.884
Where's your sister?

40:34.348 --> 40:36.350
They have a warrant out for her arrest.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.436
- <i>I know.</i>
- We have to do it tonight.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.438
She's in the wind with no alibi.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.606
<i>Montero will tell the cops it wasn't her.</i>

40:42.690 --> 40:45.401
No, it's too risky.
Maybe he forgets what you tell him.

40:46.652 --> 40:47.653
Wait.

40:48.654 --> 40:51.782
Wait. I have evidence
that can back up Montero's story.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.372
<i>Meet me across from the construction site.</i>

40:58.456 --> 41:02.293
No. Not now. They could be watching you,
hoping she reaches out to you.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.588
Daytime. We'll see 'em coming.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.756
Call me first thing.

41:45.794 --> 41:48.005
- <i>Keep walking.
- </i> Are the cops following me?

41:48.088 --> 41:50.674
<i>No, not the cops.
Just keep going. Don't look back.</i>

41:59.683 --> 42:01.227
So dicked up.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.107
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

42:32.049 --> 42:34.593
Jessica Jones!
Hands behind your head!

42:34.677 --> 42:37.137
You're under arrest
for the murder of Carl Nussbaumer.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.222
Not today.

42:38.764 --> 42:40.004
Stop, or we'll shoot!

42:51.235 --> 42:52.236
What the hell?

42:52.319 --> 42:53.988
I'm here to take your confession.

42:54.071 --> 42:56.883
What're you talking about? You better
get the hell out of here before...

42:56.907 --> 42:58.909
Before you burn down another building?

42:59.785 --> 43:02.997
You're gonna do it again, aren't you?
That's why you bought this.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.754
People died in your fires. Families!

43:20.681 --> 43:22.141
Admit what you did!

43:23.309 --> 43:24.852
You set fires. Say it!

43:25.936 --> 43:27.438
You set fires!

43:29.815 --> 43:31.609
- I set fires.
- All of it!

43:34.486 --> 43:35.904
Somebody help me!

43:40.826 --> 43:43.537
- How many died?
- Ten. I'll pay.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.041
How many?

43:50.461 --> 43:52.504
It was 14! It was accidental!

43:52.588 --> 43:54.840
You're worse than Nussbaumer.

43:55.633 --> 43:56.467
Who?

44:03.641 --> 44:06.310
Now, you're gonna tell the police
that I did this.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.247
Oh, my God.

44:38.133 --> 44:39.133
Oh, God.

44:39.593 --> 44:40.593
He...

44:41.011 --> 44:42.011
He...

44:42.554 --> 44:43.639
He attacked.

44:43.722 --> 44:47.059
We needed him alive. For Jess.

44:59.571 --> 45:00.906
You feel it again.

45:03.325 --> 45:04.493
What have we...

45:05.452 --> 45:06.912
Jesus Christ.

45:26.014 --> 45:27.015
Wait!

45:29.226 --> 45:30.602
You lost control.

45:30.686 --> 45:31.729
Do you feel it?

45:33.689 --> 45:34.982
You murdered him.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.402
Is the world better?

45:43.490 --> 45:44.908
I can make it better.

45:44.992 --> 45:48.704
You owe the world. It gave you a gift.

45:48.787 --> 45:51.498
No, no, no. That's it. No more.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.250
We're done with this.

45:53.959 --> 45:55.753
- Not yet.
- I'm done.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.212
It's okay.

45:57.629 --> 45:59.173
You have to give it back.

46:00.966 --> 46:02.176
I know who's next.

46:03.844 --> 46:05.971
- Hey. What are you...
- I've got this.
