00:00.022 --> 00:01.567
Previously on
"Devious Maids"...

00:02.291 --> 00:04.295
- What's that on your back seat?
- Nothing.

00:04.559 --> 00:07.266
Is that blood? Miss, you're
gonna have to come with me.

00:07.428 --> 00:10.896
- Who did you kill, Nick?
- I'm not a murderer.

00:10.898 --> 00:13.365
When you get home,
I won't be there.

00:13.367 --> 00:14.933
I know what you're doing.

00:14.935 --> 00:16.335
If... if...

00:16.337 --> 00:17.703
If you will just give me
a chance to explain...

00:17.705 --> 00:19.905
Give me my cane.

00:19.907 --> 00:21.607
Mr. Kenneth?

00:21.609 --> 00:23.575
- Uncle Ken had a fall.
- What?

00:23.577 --> 00:24.943
She took my kid.

00:24.945 --> 00:26.745
Drinking won't get him back.

00:26.747 --> 00:28.947
I'll get my act together.
I promise.

00:31.284 --> 00:32.417
I know
you're sleeping with Tony.

00:32.418 --> 00:33.719
Tony makes me happy.

00:33.721 --> 00:35.253
Her husband has found out
about the affair.

00:35.255 --> 00:36.954
I just have to come up
with a new plan.

00:36.956 --> 00:39.257
When I knew him,
his name wasn't Tony.

00:39.259 --> 00:41.092
You must tell me more.

00:45.631 --> 00:48.433
Your bodyguard's real name
is Amir Hassan,

00:48.435 --> 00:51.536
but he's gone by
half a dozen different aliases.

00:51.538 --> 00:54.605
He is a con man with a record
as long as your yacht.

00:54.607 --> 00:56.941
Fraud, forgery, assault...

00:56.943 --> 00:59.710
Who says there are
no more renaissance men?

00:59.712 --> 01:01.278
His usual racket

01:01.280 --> 01:03.614
is to target wealthy,
middle-aged married women.

01:03.616 --> 01:06.784
He lures them into an affair,
and then blackmails them

01:06.786 --> 01:08.552
by threatening
to tell their husbands.

01:08.554 --> 01:11.721
Evelyn will be devastated
when she finds out.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.657
I can't wait to tell her.

01:14.635 --> 01:15.459
Thanks again, Rick.

01:15.461 --> 01:17.594
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do for you.

01:17.596 --> 01:19.929
Wait.

01:19.931 --> 01:22.299
I already know
they're involved.

01:22.301 --> 01:23.967
Tony knows I know.

01:23.969 --> 01:25.636
- He does?
- Yes.

01:25.638 --> 01:28.138
So how can he possibly think
he's going to blackmail her?

01:28.140 --> 01:29.973
He must have thought
of some other way

01:29.975 --> 01:31.307
to get money out of you.

01:31.509 --> 01:33.843
But how?

01:38.349 --> 01:40.816
Hello, you.

01:40.818 --> 01:42.518
Good morning,
Mrs. Powell.

01:42.520 --> 01:46.288
Here's the schedule for today.

01:46.290 --> 01:48.156
You and I
are going to make love.

01:48.158 --> 01:49.692
I will orgasm two times.

01:49.694 --> 01:52.060
Then you will drive me
to the sale at Gucci,

01:52.062 --> 01:53.863
where I will orgasm twice more.

01:53.865 --> 01:55.698
I'm not really in the mood.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.533
Since when?

01:57.535 --> 01:59.201
Mrs. Powell,
please...

01:59.203 --> 02:00.869
Why do you keep calling me
Mrs. Powell?

02:00.871 --> 02:02.670
I-I'm not trying
to upset you.

02:02.672 --> 02:06.074
Well, then I think you should be
a good employee and get naked.

02:08.244 --> 02:09.577
All right.

02:09.579 --> 02:12.347
I really can't afford
to lose this job.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.748
Well, you won't.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.750
Not if you keep
kissing me like that...

02:36.405 --> 02:37.571
Hey, you.

02:37.573 --> 02:39.807
Good morning, Javi.

02:41.410 --> 02:43.411
Did you have a good time
last night?

02:43.413 --> 02:44.912
Am I making you a frittata?

02:46.249 --> 02:47.581
You must have had
a very good time.

02:47.583 --> 02:49.149
I did, indeed.

03:03.130 --> 03:04.798
Yes?

03:04.800 --> 03:06.266
I'm Pablo.

03:07.435 --> 03:09.369
Zoila's Pablo.

03:09.371 --> 03:11.271
Her ex-husband?

03:11.273 --> 03:13.106
Her current husband,
but thanks for asking.

03:13.108 --> 03:14.140
Is she here?

03:14.142 --> 03:15.641
She's making breakfast.

03:15.643 --> 03:18.111
That smells good.

03:18.113 --> 03:20.280
If you invite him to eat
with us, I'll kill you.

03:20.282 --> 03:23.115
- We have to talk.
- No, we don't.

03:23.117 --> 03:25.451
We really, really do.

03:25.453 --> 03:26.819
Could you leave us alone?

03:26.821 --> 03:28.320
Okay.

03:28.322 --> 03:31.123
- Stay right there.
- Okay.

03:31.125 --> 03:32.558
Zoila, please.
This is important.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.426
If it's so important,
why didn't you call me?

03:34.428 --> 03:36.562
I did call you...
10 times last night.

03:36.564 --> 03:37.730
Where were you?

03:37.732 --> 03:39.664
Well, first,
we were in the shower...

03:39.666 --> 03:41.000
Not now, Javi.

03:41.002 --> 03:43.168
Zoila, grab your purse.
You got to go with me.

03:43.170 --> 03:44.636
Listen to me, menso.

03:44.638 --> 03:46.671
You left
after 20 years of marriage,

03:46.673 --> 03:49.508
destroying my self-confidence
and my self-esteem.

03:49.510 --> 03:51.810
The one thing in this world
I am sure of

03:51.812 --> 03:54.980
is that I don't have to go
with you anywhere ever again.

03:54.982 --> 03:56.414
Valentina's in jail.

03:56.416 --> 03:58.817
The police
found blood in her car,

03:58.819 --> 04:00.351
and she won't say
where it came from.

04:01.353 --> 04:03.855
I have to go.

04:10.196 --> 04:11.329
It's gorgeous.

04:11.331 --> 04:12.596
It is.

04:12.598 --> 04:14.332
Reggie is
a very generous boyfriend.

04:14.334 --> 04:16.000
Not really.

04:16.002 --> 04:19.003
We've been dating for months,
but we haven't... you know.

04:19.005 --> 04:21.872
He thinks the necklace
will get me in the mood.

04:21.874 --> 04:23.374
This is
a four-carat diamond.

04:23.376 --> 04:25.343
He's got me in the mood.

04:25.345 --> 04:26.844
Well,
I will not sleep with him.

04:26.846 --> 04:28.178
He's a worm.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.513
A worm that paid
for a platinum setting.

04:29.515 --> 04:30.881
Carmen!

04:30.883 --> 04:32.182
Okay, I'll shut up
if I get to wear it.

04:32.184 --> 04:35.019
So, why do you think
Reggie is a worm?

04:35.021 --> 04:38.188
He got Mr. Kenneth to kick
his daughter out of the house,

04:38.190 --> 04:39.523
and then his wife.

04:39.525 --> 04:41.391
And now Mr. Kenneth
is in the hospital

04:41.393 --> 04:43.226
because of a "mysterious" fall.

04:43.228 --> 04:46.029
Why would Reggie
want to hurt his Uncle?

04:46.031 --> 04:48.198
He's embezzling
Mr. Kenneth's money.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.833
And with everybody gone,
he can get away with it.

04:50.835 --> 04:52.369
Maybe you should
call the police.

04:52.371 --> 04:55.205
I will once I have proof.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.706
How are you going to get that?

04:56.708 --> 04:59.543
I'll go through
Reggie's papers.

04:59.545 --> 05:01.177
If I can find copies

05:01.179 --> 05:04.714
of his bank statements
or wire transfers...

05:04.716 --> 05:07.183
Well, just don't let him know
that you're on to him.

05:07.185 --> 05:10.519
He doesn't think I'm smart
enough to figure this out.

05:10.521 --> 05:13.056
He just sees me
as some dumb immigrant.

05:13.058 --> 05:14.891
Then he is in
for a rude awakening.

05:14.893 --> 05:16.559
Well, I should get going.

05:16.561 --> 05:18.727
I'll call you girls
in a few days.

05:18.729 --> 05:20.996
Wait. Carmen?
The necklace?

05:20.998 --> 05:24.200
Oh. Did I forget
to take this off?

05:24.202 --> 05:25.568
Hmm.

05:25.570 --> 05:26.902
I'm sorry.

05:39.348 --> 05:40.616
Thanks for coming, man.

05:40.618 --> 05:42.217
I had to cut class for this.

05:42.219 --> 05:43.619
What the hell is going on?

05:43.621 --> 05:45.253
I need to borrow some money.

05:45.255 --> 05:46.421
Dude...

05:46.423 --> 05:47.623
I got to get out of town
for a while.

05:47.625 --> 05:48.757
Can you help me out or what?

05:50.060 --> 05:52.960
I mean,
I only got a couple bucks.

05:52.962 --> 05:54.095
What's going on?

05:55.298 --> 05:57.198
I think
we're about to be caught.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.933
Did you tell someone?

05:58.935 --> 06:00.868
Valentina.

06:00.870 --> 06:02.103
How could you do that?!

06:02.105 --> 06:04.939
I got stabbed,
and she's not stupid!

06:04.941 --> 06:06.241
This is bad.

06:06.243 --> 06:09.243
- I mean, if she tells someone...
- I don't think she will.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.444
But I'm getting out
just in case.

06:10.446 --> 06:11.646
You might want to do the same.

06:19.404 --> 06:20.621
Remi!

06:20.623 --> 06:22.456
Where is she?

06:22.458 --> 06:24.291
She's in some room
being questioned.

06:24.293 --> 06:25.459
They won't let me see her.

06:25.461 --> 06:26.793
Oh, my God.

06:26.795 --> 06:28.061
She didn't want me
to call you guys,

06:28.063 --> 06:29.329
but I didn't know
what else to do.

06:29.331 --> 06:30.631
Well, you did the right thing.

06:30.633 --> 06:31.665
I don't understand.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.133
Do you know what happened?

06:34.936 --> 06:36.537
You'll have to ask her.

06:40.975 --> 06:42.275
Mami!

06:42.277 --> 06:43.609
Mija!

06:43.611 --> 06:44.811
What's going on?

06:44.813 --> 06:46.646
They said they found blood
in your car.

06:46.648 --> 06:49.082
I know it looks bad, but I didn't
do anything wrong. I swear.

06:49.084 --> 06:50.817
We're willing
to believe her

06:50.819 --> 06:52.986
if she tells us whose blood
it is and how it got there.

06:52.988 --> 06:54.320
So tell them.

06:54.322 --> 06:56.189
I can't.

06:56.191 --> 06:57.690
Valentina Josefina Diaz,

06:57.692 --> 06:59.825
you tell these people
what they want to know now.

06:59.827 --> 07:03.162
Can't we talk about it at home?

07:03.164 --> 07:04.664
First she has to answer
our questions.

07:04.666 --> 07:07.333
Wait a minute. Has she
been placed under arrest?

07:07.335 --> 07:09.535
Not yet.

07:09.537 --> 07:11.003
Then that means
you can't hold her.

07:11.005 --> 07:12.171
Am I right?

07:12.173 --> 07:13.471
It would be
in her best interest

07:13.473 --> 07:15.007
to assist
with this investigation.

07:15.009 --> 07:16.541
Yeah, well, I'm her father,

07:16.543 --> 07:17.976
and I think it's in her
best interest that she go home.

07:17.978 --> 07:19.044
Sir, please...

07:19.046 --> 07:20.345
You heard the man.
We're leaving.

07:51.810 --> 07:52.877
Rosie?

07:59.218 --> 08:01.552
Hey.
I've got good news.

08:01.554 --> 08:02.720
Really?

08:02.722 --> 08:03.987
I've received
all the affidavits

08:03.989 --> 08:05.556
the immigration judge
asked for.

08:05.558 --> 08:07.558
You and Miguel
are literally days away

08:07.560 --> 08:09.059
from getting resident status.

08:10.896 --> 08:12.730
Isn't that great?

08:12.732 --> 08:15.699
Yes. It is.

08:15.701 --> 08:18.235
Thank you so much
for all your hard work.

08:18.237 --> 08:20.070
It's my pleasure.

08:20.072 --> 08:22.372
What is this?

08:22.374 --> 08:24.241
Where did you get that?

08:24.243 --> 08:27.043
I found it on the floor.

08:27.045 --> 08:30.580
Oh.

08:30.582 --> 08:32.414
That's a brochure
for maple park.

08:32.417 --> 08:34.751
Best assisted-living center
in the country.

08:34.753 --> 08:38.254
They have pools,
uh, tennis courts, the works.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.722
Why would you have this?

08:39.724 --> 08:41.357
Well, after his fall,

08:41.359 --> 08:43.092
Uncle Ken will need more help
than we can provide.

08:43.094 --> 08:45.928
And maple park
has 24-hour medical care.

08:45.930 --> 08:48.063
But this is in Sacramento.

08:48.065 --> 08:49.766
How could we visit him?

08:49.768 --> 08:51.601
I'm sure we'd find a way.

08:51.603 --> 08:53.936
Look, the paperwork
has been signed.

08:53.938 --> 08:56.438
There's no point
in arguing about it.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.274
So, when are you
sending him there?

08:58.276 --> 09:00.575
Two weeks.

09:00.577 --> 09:02.244
No!

09:02.246 --> 09:05.114
Why are you getting so upset?

09:05.116 --> 09:07.283
My Uncle's going to be
well cared for.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.117
You're gonna get a green card.

09:09.119 --> 09:11.820
Come on, Rosie.

09:11.822 --> 09:14.323
It's a happy ending
for everyone.

09:20.072 --> 09:22.739
- Son of a bitch!
- What's wrong?

09:22.841 --> 09:26.176
Those idiotic writers... they've
put my character in a coma.

09:26.178 --> 09:27.811
Dr. Lance is in a coma?

09:27.813 --> 09:30.346
Nurse Jenny's
gonna be so upset.

09:30.348 --> 09:31.615
You know why they did it?

09:31.617 --> 09:33.082
So they can give
more screen time

09:33.084 --> 09:34.518
to that punk
playing Dr. Blake.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.753
Oh, he's so dreamy.

09:37.788 --> 09:39.623
For a punk.

09:39.625 --> 09:40.790
I can't believe this!

09:40.792 --> 09:42.258
Look on the bright side.

09:42.260 --> 09:44.527
They're paying you
to sleep in bed all day.

09:44.529 --> 09:46.695
I wouldn't mind that.
Hint hint.

09:46.697 --> 09:49.365
No, it's humiliating.

09:49.367 --> 09:52.135
Being hooked up to an I.V.
While Mr. "I went to Juilliard"

09:52.137 --> 09:53.969
is making out
with my love interest?

09:53.971 --> 09:55.804
What are you looking for?

09:55.806 --> 09:57.373
Some scotch.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.375
I threw all the liquor away
because you stopped drinking.

09:59.377 --> 10:00.809
Remember?

10:00.811 --> 10:02.044
I just need something
to calm my nerves.

10:02.046 --> 10:03.145
Here we go.

10:03.147 --> 10:04.780
You're hiding booze?

10:04.782 --> 10:06.882
It's for emergencies,
and that script is an emergency.

10:06.884 --> 10:09.818
Needing alcohol to cope
is the emergency.

10:09.820 --> 10:11.987
You're my maid, Carmen.

10:11.989 --> 10:13.055
Not my mom.

10:13.057 --> 10:15.958
So, if you don't mind...

10:17.493 --> 10:19.494
I appreciate you meeting
with me, Mrs. Parker.

10:19.496 --> 10:21.163
It's my pleasure.

10:21.165 --> 10:24.732
Mr. dresden tells me that
we have a "friend" in common.

10:24.734 --> 10:27.569
What's he calling himself
these days?

10:27.571 --> 10:28.836
Tony Bishara.

10:28.838 --> 10:31.339
He presented himself
as a bodyguard.

10:31.341 --> 10:33.308
He told me he was a chef.

10:33.310 --> 10:34.742
Tony knows how to cook?

10:34.744 --> 10:35.843
Not really.

10:35.845 --> 10:38.179
But he was attentive and caring

10:38.181 --> 10:41.315
and looked at me
with desire in his eyes,

10:41.317 --> 10:44.518
something my husband
hadn't done for years.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.853
And with that body of his,

10:45.855 --> 10:46.988
he could have served me
Chinese takeout

10:46.990 --> 10:48.089
and I wouldn't have cared.

10:48.391 --> 10:50.824
So you began an affair.

10:50.826 --> 10:53.660
I'm not a stupid woman,
Mr. Powell.

10:53.662 --> 10:56.997
But he knew
all the right buttons to push.

10:56.999 --> 10:59.500
That is his talent.

10:59.502 --> 11:02.068
That's why I hate him.

11:02.070 --> 11:05.839
Mr. Hassan ended up
soaking Mrs. Parker for $80,000.

11:05.841 --> 11:10.676
It would have been more, but
my husband unexpectedly died.

11:10.678 --> 11:13.179
Without that leverage...

11:13.181 --> 11:15.648
I'm so sorry.

11:18.152 --> 11:19.652
If I may ask...

11:19.654 --> 11:22.822
Are you going to tell your wife
what you've learned?

11:22.824 --> 11:24.757
How can I not?

11:24.759 --> 11:27.927
I suppose you have no choice.

11:27.929 --> 11:32.031
But I implore you
to proceed carefully.

11:33.700 --> 11:38.538
Women need
to feel beautiful and loved,

11:38.540 --> 11:40.673
especially those
of a certain age.

11:40.675 --> 11:46.378
And when we discover
that we've been fools...

11:46.380 --> 11:51.850
It can break us
in ways men can't imagine.

12:00.861 --> 12:03.327
How can I help you, detectives?

12:03.329 --> 12:04.796
We're trying
to build a time line

12:04.798 --> 12:06.565
for the night
of your husband's accident.

12:06.567 --> 12:08.800
Do you know when he left
the house to go for his run?

12:08.802 --> 12:11.069
I was in bed reading,
and I fell asleep.

12:11.071 --> 12:12.571
Can't Nick tell you?

12:12.573 --> 12:15.139
He doesn't remember much,
which isn't surprising.

12:15.141 --> 12:16.740
I wish I could be more helpful.

12:16.742 --> 12:18.076
This is a big property.

12:18.078 --> 12:19.310
Do you have security cameras?

12:19.312 --> 12:20.778
We do.

12:26.085 --> 12:29.253
That's the end of the driveway,
by the front gate.

12:29.255 --> 12:30.421
9:05 P.M.

12:30.423 --> 12:33.223
Thank you,
Mrs. Deering.

12:33.225 --> 12:37.595
Please don't hesitate to call
if you have any other questions.

12:37.597 --> 12:39.262
I have one.

12:39.264 --> 12:41.732
Can you think of anyone who
would want to hurt your husband?

12:41.734 --> 12:43.500
What?

12:43.502 --> 12:45.769
Well, typically, drivers brake
before the moment of impact.

12:45.771 --> 12:47.670
But there were no skid marks
on the bridge,

12:47.672 --> 12:49.439
which means
the car never slowed down.

12:49.441 --> 12:52.442
Indicating this hit-and-run
was deliberate.

12:52.444 --> 12:54.777
Oh, my God.

12:54.779 --> 12:56.746
Well, at this point,
it's just a theory.

12:56.748 --> 12:58.681
Thank you for your time.

13:05.756 --> 13:07.123
Tony!

13:07.125 --> 13:08.925
I was just about
to pour myself a Brandy.

13:08.927 --> 13:11.427
- Join me?
- That's quite all right.

13:11.429 --> 13:13.129
I'm sharing my wife with you.

13:13.131 --> 13:15.632
The least you could do
is share a drink with me.

13:19.970 --> 13:21.970
Here you go, Tony.

13:21.972 --> 13:25.974
Or do you prefer "Paolo"?
Or "Maximillian"?

13:27.310 --> 13:29.945
You have
quite the assortment of aliases.

13:29.947 --> 13:32.881
"Gunther" surprised me.

13:32.883 --> 13:35.317
I would've thought you'd be too
swarthy to pull off germanic.

13:35.319 --> 13:36.318
Good for you.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.988
I... Don't know
what to say.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.289
Well, for starters,

13:41.291 --> 13:42.991
why don't you tell me
what your "plan b" is.

13:42.993 --> 13:44.492
My plan "b"?

13:44.494 --> 13:46.628
Historically, you like
to blackmail your victims,

13:46.630 --> 13:48.496
threatening to expose
their tawdry affairs,

13:48.498 --> 13:51.499
but clearly, that won't work
with Evelyn and I.

13:51.501 --> 13:53.501
So I'm just dying to know...

13:53.503 --> 13:55.403
What is your next move?

13:57.406 --> 14:00.808
I intend to file a lawsuit.

14:00.810 --> 14:02.577
Excellent.
What kind of lawsuit?

14:02.579 --> 14:04.145
For harassment.

14:04.147 --> 14:08.183
Your wife forced me
to perform sexual acts

14:08.185 --> 14:12.352
and threatened to fire me
if I failed to comply.

14:12.354 --> 14:14.321
I have a recording.

14:18.359 --> 14:20.227
Is that
what I found in your clock?

14:22.998 --> 14:24.531
Oops.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.500
You son of a bitch.

14:26.502 --> 14:29.503
That is a hell of a thing
to call the man

14:29.505 --> 14:32.506
who's about
to give you $100,000.

14:32.508 --> 14:35.108
What?

14:35.110 --> 14:37.544
That's what you want, isn't it?
My money?

14:37.546 --> 14:40.214
Why would you
just give me $100,000?

14:40.216 --> 14:41.715
Because I love my wife.

14:41.717 --> 14:44.017
And I'd like to spare her
the embarrassment

14:44.019 --> 14:45.952
of finding out
that you used her.

14:45.954 --> 14:48.387
Is this some sort of trick?

14:48.389 --> 14:50.023
Not at all.

14:50.025 --> 14:53.226
Now, which phony name
shall I make out the check to?

14:53.228 --> 14:57.030
If it's Mustafa, you'll have to
help me with the spelling.

14:57.032 --> 14:58.732
Make it out to cash.

14:58.734 --> 15:01.534
I think I can handle that.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.975
But there's one condition
you'll need to agree to.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.536
Your mom and I
have been talking.

15:23.538 --> 15:26.372
We think you're protecting
that boy you've been dating.

15:26.374 --> 15:29.174
Are we right?

15:29.176 --> 15:31.943
Is that Ethan's blood
in the car?

15:35.048 --> 15:36.281
Yes.

15:38.851 --> 15:41.053
Why was he bleeding?

15:43.556 --> 15:45.790
He got stabbed.

15:47.359 --> 15:49.528
And how did he get stabbed?

15:49.530 --> 15:54.332
Mija, please...

15:57.870 --> 16:00.038
He's part of that gang

16:00.040 --> 16:02.407
that's been robbing houses
in Beverly Hills.

16:04.376 --> 16:06.544
The one
that killed Alejandro Rubio?

16:06.546 --> 16:08.379
That was an accident.

16:08.381 --> 16:10.448
Oh, my God.

16:10.450 --> 16:12.850
How long
have you known about this?

16:12.852 --> 16:14.718
I just found out.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.220
We call the police now.

16:16.222 --> 16:18.556
No!
I can't turn Ethan in!

16:18.558 --> 16:20.390
A man died!

16:20.392 --> 16:22.560
You can go to prison
for not telling!

16:22.562 --> 16:24.061
He's important to me!

16:24.063 --> 16:26.897
I'm not gonna ruin his life!

16:26.899 --> 16:28.933
Mija.

16:28.935 --> 16:30.233
Listen to me.

16:31.571 --> 16:35.739
When I was 17,
a couple of friends

16:35.741 --> 16:37.907
convinced me
to help them steal a car.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.076
Pablo...

16:39.078 --> 16:40.944
It's okay.

16:44.082 --> 16:46.083
We thought
we got away with it...

16:46.085 --> 16:49.419
Right up until we saw the police
lights coming up behind us.

16:49.421 --> 16:51.254
What happened?

16:51.256 --> 16:54.724
I spent 14 months in jail.

16:54.726 --> 16:57.093
Is he serious?

16:57.095 --> 16:59.996
Your father
never wanted you to know.

17:02.099 --> 17:04.701
He thought
you would be ashamed of him.

17:06.604 --> 17:09.005
I hooked up
with the wrong crowd.

17:09.007 --> 17:11.339
And it cost me
a year of my life.

17:11.342 --> 17:14.109
I'm begging you...

17:14.112 --> 17:18.079
Please don't make
the same mistake I did.

17:25.589 --> 17:30.926
Mrs. Powell, I'm afraid
I have some troubling news.

17:30.928 --> 17:34.963
Don't tell me you're too tired
for our afternoon romp.

17:34.965 --> 17:39.868
Actually, I've been offered
a unique business opportunity,

17:39.870 --> 17:42.937
which means
that I'll be leaving.

17:42.939 --> 17:45.640
Tony!

17:45.642 --> 17:49.710
- If money is the issue...
- It's more than that.

17:49.712 --> 17:54.115
It's become increasingly
difficult for me to work here.

17:54.117 --> 17:56.951
Why?

17:58.954 --> 18:02.023
You're an extraordinary woman.

18:02.025 --> 18:05.492
Mysterious, smart, beautiful...

18:05.494 --> 18:08.663
Ohh.
Keep going.

18:08.665 --> 18:11.832
The point is,
I can't continue to work here

18:11.834 --> 18:14.068
knowing you'll never be mine.

18:14.070 --> 18:15.469
It's pure torture.

18:15.471 --> 18:19.306
I had no idea
you felt this way.

18:19.308 --> 18:23.177
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

18:23.179 --> 18:26.146
Because I knew it was pointless
falling in love with you.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.014
You'd never leave your husband.

18:28.016 --> 18:30.050
That's quite an assumption.

18:30.052 --> 18:31.251
It's true.

18:31.253 --> 18:34.020
You love him so very much,

18:34.022 --> 18:37.891
almost as much
as he loves and needs you.

18:37.893 --> 18:40.193
So...

18:40.195 --> 18:41.995
When are you leaving?

18:41.997 --> 18:43.997
Now.

18:45.032 --> 18:47.533
I have to go to the bank
and deposit some money,

18:47.535 --> 18:49.535
and then I'll be off
to the airport.

18:49.537 --> 18:50.703
But it's not fair.

18:50.705 --> 18:52.705
Can't we have
one last glorious tryst?

18:52.707 --> 18:54.006
There isn't time.

18:54.008 --> 18:57.543
Well, one last kiss, then.

18:57.545 --> 19:00.079
For old times' sake.

19:10.890 --> 19:13.058
I really must go.

19:13.060 --> 19:17.495
Goodbye, Tony Bishara.

19:21.734 --> 19:24.102
Thank you for loving me.

19:36.916 --> 19:38.950
Westmore residence.

19:38.952 --> 19:42.286
Oh, sorry.
He's at work today.

19:42.288 --> 19:44.421
He never showed up?

19:44.423 --> 19:47.225
That doesn't make any sense.

19:49.295 --> 19:50.527
Hold on.

19:52.064 --> 19:53.264
Psst!
Spence! Spence!

19:53.266 --> 19:54.831
It's 8:30.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.467
You were supposed to be
at the studio half an hour ago!

19:56.469 --> 19:59.436
You should really work
on that accent.

19:59.438 --> 20:02.072
I have no idea
what you're saying.

20:02.074 --> 20:03.774
Hi.

20:03.776 --> 20:05.409
Yeah,
just give him 15 more minutes.

20:05.411 --> 20:07.411
You know, he's having problems
with his car,

20:07.413 --> 20:09.446
but I'm sure
he's gonna be there very soon.

20:09.448 --> 20:10.581
Okay. Thanks.

20:10.583 --> 20:14.284
Come on. Get up.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.293
Let's go!

20:23.295 --> 20:25.262
Let's do this.

20:25.264 --> 20:27.497
Come on.
Okay.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.134
Aah.
Let's go!

20:32.136 --> 20:35.104
Where the hell is Westmore?!

20:35.106 --> 20:36.839
If we don't start shooting
in 10 minutes,

20:36.841 --> 20:38.308
we're not gonna make our day.

20:38.310 --> 20:40.976
Carmen: He's here!
Everybody calm down.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.312
- He's here.
- Finally.

20:42.314 --> 20:44.146
Wardrobe, let's get him ready.

20:45.482 --> 20:48.483
Hi.
What's going on here?

20:48.485 --> 20:50.853
Since he found out
that he was gonna be in a coma,

20:50.855 --> 20:52.654
he refuses
to get out of character.

20:52.656 --> 20:54.323
What a pro, huh?

20:54.325 --> 20:55.825
Huh. Right.

20:55.827 --> 20:57.159
All right.

20:57.161 --> 20:58.327
Move like you got purpose,
people!

20:58.329 --> 20:59.528
Come on!

20:59.530 --> 21:00.729
You're doing good.
Get into bed.

21:00.731 --> 21:01.996
Come on.
Ready to do this?

21:01.998 --> 21:03.264
Let's go.
Can you help him?

21:05.368 --> 21:06.568
No, no, no, no!

21:06.570 --> 21:08.036
Face up, amigo!

21:08.038 --> 21:10.439
Let's go.

21:11.974 --> 21:13.875
Come on.
Are we ready?

21:15.010 --> 21:16.678
All right.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.579
Slate's good.

21:19.982 --> 21:21.216
Everybody to one.

21:21.218 --> 21:24.018
Camera one,
just in a touch. And set.

21:24.020 --> 21:27.856
And... action!

21:27.858 --> 21:29.590
What's wrong, Jenny?

21:29.592 --> 21:32.193
I keep thinking
about last night.

21:32.195 --> 21:33.427
What I let you do to me...

21:33.429 --> 21:34.829
I won't apologize
for kissing you.

21:34.831 --> 21:36.530
But Lance is in a coma.

21:36.532 --> 21:38.031
When he wakes up...

21:38.033 --> 21:39.199
We'll have
some explaining to do.

21:39.201 --> 21:40.401
But until then...

21:40.403 --> 21:42.002
I need to love you.

21:53.714 --> 21:55.415
Damn it! Cut!

21:55.417 --> 21:56.750
Cut!

21:56.752 --> 21:59.019
Somebody get him some coffee,
please.

21:59.021 --> 22:00.220
Wake up!

22:07.126 --> 22:09.460
Mr. Kenneth?

22:09.462 --> 22:13.130
I need to talk to you
about your nephew.

22:13.132 --> 22:17.968
Did you know he's planning
to put you in a nursing home?

22:17.970 --> 22:21.306
Mr. Kenneth,
did you hear me?

22:21.308 --> 22:23.474
We have to stop him.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.376
What's the point?

22:25.378 --> 22:28.279
What?

22:28.281 --> 22:31.816
I spent my life
trying to control everybody.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.418
Now the people
I love most...

22:34.487 --> 22:38.155
Didi, Lucinda...
they hate me.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.791
Mr. Kenneth,
you have to be strong now.

22:40.793 --> 22:44.661
We have to get you out of here
before Reggie sends you away.

22:44.663 --> 22:50.500
Whatever's about to happen
to me, I got it coming.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.968
Excuse me.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.504
This man isn't
supposed to have visitors.

22:54.506 --> 22:58.174
I was just leaving anyway.

22:58.176 --> 22:59.943
Don't give up,
Mr. Kenneth.

22:59.945 --> 23:02.345
We'll think of something.

23:19.295 --> 23:20.696
Hello?

23:20.698 --> 23:22.331
This is Nate
from Doheny Medical Center.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.433
You told me to call if anyone
came to see your Uncle.

23:24.435 --> 23:26.535
Sounds like
that was money well spent.

23:26.537 --> 23:29.705
Yeah, well, this pretty little
Mexican chick was just here.

23:29.707 --> 23:32.540
Didn't really catch her name.

23:32.542 --> 23:37.212
That's okay.
I know who you mean.

23:42.151 --> 23:43.385
Script delivery.

23:43.387 --> 23:44.887
Thank you.
I'll take it.

23:44.889 --> 23:47.356
And please tell Mr. Westmore
I'm really sorry.

23:47.358 --> 23:49.290
He was always
really nice to me.

23:53.629 --> 23:55.229
Uh-oh.

23:55.231 --> 23:57.565
Who's that?

23:57.567 --> 24:00.902
So, they just
delivered your script.

24:02.071 --> 24:03.571
I think you should read it.

24:03.573 --> 24:04.906
Why?
I'm in a coma.

24:04.908 --> 24:06.740
It's not like
I have any lines to memorize.

24:06.742 --> 24:09.410
Well, it looks like the writers
changed your story line.

24:09.412 --> 24:12.413
Really?
Am I waking up?

24:12.415 --> 24:14.481
Not so much.

24:16.584 --> 24:18.085
They're killing me off?

24:18.087 --> 24:20.254
I'm sorry.

24:20.256 --> 24:22.155
20 years I'm on this show.

24:22.157 --> 24:24.257
They can't tell me in person?

24:24.259 --> 24:26.059
Well, on the bright side,

24:26.061 --> 24:28.762
now you have time
to visit Tucker in Europe.

24:28.764 --> 24:30.764
How am I gonna pay for that?
I don't have a job.

24:30.766 --> 24:32.433
I'm sure you have savings.

24:32.435 --> 24:34.735
The divorce cleaned me out.
I can't even afford you.

24:34.737 --> 24:36.937
That's not good.

24:36.939 --> 24:39.072
Where are my keys?

24:39.074 --> 24:40.273
Why?

24:40.275 --> 24:41.774
The producer
lives a mile from here.

24:41.776 --> 24:43.009
I am gonna go tell him off.

24:43.011 --> 24:44.177
You've been drinking.

24:44.179 --> 24:45.778
I'm fine!
Where are my keys?

24:45.780 --> 24:48.281
Carmen, give me those.

24:48.283 --> 24:49.715
Let me drive you.

24:49.717 --> 24:51.117
- No, I'll drive myself.
- Not until you're sober.

24:54.456 --> 24:56.288
Give me those keys!

24:56.290 --> 24:59.425
This is for your own good!

25:02.128 --> 25:03.463
Open this door!

25:03.465 --> 25:04.530
I want those keys!

25:04.532 --> 25:05.631
Do you hear me?!

25:05.633 --> 25:06.966
Do you?!

25:06.968 --> 25:09.602
Do you hear me?

25:20.146 --> 25:22.314
Hey, Rosie.

25:22.316 --> 25:24.984
Oh, hi.

25:24.986 --> 25:26.485
I'm sorry I'm late.

25:26.487 --> 25:28.820
The store was so busy today.

25:30.277 --> 25:32.762
Don't lie to me.
I know you went the hospital.

25:33.994 --> 25:38.497
Only 'cause I was worried
about Mr. Kenneth.

25:38.499 --> 25:41.165
Well, I'm glad
you got a chance to say goodbye.

25:41.167 --> 25:43.468
Why are you smiling?

25:43.470 --> 25:45.836
The doctors said
he's well enough to travel.

25:45.838 --> 25:48.006
I'm sending him
to maple park on Monday.

25:48.008 --> 25:49.507
Monday?!

25:49.509 --> 25:52.510
- You can't.
- Why not?

25:52.512 --> 25:56.247
Because...

25:56.249 --> 25:58.016
If you do,
I'll go to the police

25:58.018 --> 26:00.018
and I'll tell them
what you're up to.

26:00.020 --> 26:03.186
And just what am I up to?

26:03.188 --> 26:04.855
Mr. Kenneth
was getting stronger.

26:04.857 --> 26:06.857
He wanted to take back control
of his business,

26:06.859 --> 26:09.159
so you made him fall
to get rid of him,

26:09.161 --> 26:11.996
just like you got rid
of Mrs. Didi and miss Lucinda.

26:11.998 --> 26:14.031
Now, why would I do that?

26:14.033 --> 26:15.933
To get
Mr. Kenneth's money.

26:15.935 --> 26:19.436
I know what it means to have
someone's power of attorney.

26:19.438 --> 26:20.537
I'm not stupid.

26:20.539 --> 26:23.540
So, how long have you known?

26:23.542 --> 26:26.376
Long enough.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.545
You're not the only one
who can lie to people's faces.

26:28.547 --> 26:30.380
You shouldn't screw with me.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.715
Not when I have your future
in my hand.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.383
Go ahead. Fire me.

26:34.385 --> 26:37.386
I'll be thrilled not
to be working for you anymore.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.055
Or kiss you.

26:40.361 --> 26:42.734
I'm not talking
about firing you.

26:44.295 --> 26:46.395
There's an immigration hearing
next week.

26:46.397 --> 26:48.698
It could go well
for you and your son...

26:48.700 --> 26:51.233
Or not so well.

26:51.235 --> 26:55.637
You're threatening
to send us back to Mexico?

26:55.639 --> 26:58.207
Picked up on that, did you?

27:00.243 --> 27:02.778
I guess you're not that stupid.

27:21.598 --> 27:24.299
Can you think of anyone who
would want to hurt your husband?

28:10.245 --> 28:11.645
Hello?

28:11.647 --> 28:13.246
Hello, Opal.

28:13.248 --> 28:14.480
Marisol.

28:14.482 --> 28:16.650
What a...
Pleasant surprise.

28:16.652 --> 28:18.051
Sorry to bother you.

28:18.053 --> 28:19.653
But the police dropped by.

28:19.655 --> 28:22.656
They wanted to know what time
Nicholas left the house

28:22.658 --> 28:23.990
the night of the accident.

28:23.992 --> 28:26.526
So I showed them
the security footage.

28:28.495 --> 28:30.129
You did?

28:30.131 --> 28:31.497
Relax.

28:31.499 --> 28:32.831
I didn't show them the part

28:32.833 --> 28:34.733
where you drove off
a few minutes later.

28:34.735 --> 28:36.669
I can explain.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.304
Of course.

28:38.306 --> 28:39.972
Why don't you
come to the house,

28:39.974 --> 28:41.641
and you can tell me everything?

28:41.643 --> 28:43.842
Then I don't have to
get the police involved.

28:43.844 --> 28:47.245
I'll be right over.

29:18.353 --> 29:21.988
- About what happened earlier...
- You scared the hell out of me.

29:21.990 --> 29:24.823
I know. I know.
I was out of control.

29:24.825 --> 29:27.026
I'm so sorry.

29:27.028 --> 29:29.362
I promise
it will never happen again.

29:29.364 --> 29:30.662
I know it won't...

29:30.664 --> 29:32.664
Because you're going to rehab.

29:32.666 --> 29:35.567
Ah.
That's not necessary.

29:35.569 --> 29:39.405
- I can control my drinking.
- I don't think you can.

29:41.108 --> 29:42.541
Don't get that.

29:42.543 --> 29:43.876
I don't want to talk
to anyone right now.

29:43.878 --> 29:47.012
Spence,
you'll want to see this person.

29:47.014 --> 29:50.181
Who is it?

29:50.183 --> 29:52.183
Someone you'll listen to.

29:56.622 --> 29:58.957
Hey.

30:01.693 --> 30:03.795
I heard
you haven't been feeling well.

30:03.797 --> 30:05.696
Yeah.

30:05.698 --> 30:08.132
I've had
a-a rough couple of weeks.

30:08.134 --> 30:11.201
Carmen says
you've been drinking too much.

30:11.203 --> 30:12.537
Oh, I don't know
what she told you,

30:12.539 --> 30:13.704
but I can get myself together.

30:13.706 --> 30:16.206
I-I don't need
to go to rehab.

30:16.208 --> 30:20.478
When she became your maid,
I asked her to look after you.

30:20.480 --> 30:24.248
And if Carmen thinks
you need help, then...

30:24.250 --> 30:27.949
- I think so, too.
- This is so embarrassing.

30:28.021 --> 30:31.022
Why? Because two
people care about you?

30:31.023 --> 30:34.024
I never wanted you
to see me like this.

30:36.527 --> 30:40.364
All I see when I look at you
is a wonderful man.

30:40.366 --> 30:43.967
So you don't hate me?

30:43.969 --> 30:47.371
Of course not.

30:49.707 --> 30:51.941
Go to rehab.

30:51.943 --> 30:55.311
When you get back...

30:55.313 --> 30:57.613
I will be here
waiting for you.

31:21.237 --> 31:22.805
What is that?

31:22.807 --> 31:24.840
I stumbled across
some of our old records.

31:24.842 --> 31:28.277
I thought I'd give them a spin.
Digitally speaking.

31:28.279 --> 31:30.913
I haven't heard
that tango in ages.

31:30.915 --> 31:32.747
We danced to it
on our honeymoon.

31:32.749 --> 31:34.549
Did we?

31:37.687 --> 31:40.222
I can't remember that far back.

31:43.092 --> 31:47.595
Luckily for you...
I can.

31:48.665 --> 31:50.965
- Are you serious?
- Tony's gone.

31:50.967 --> 31:53.468
No one will walk in on us.

31:53.470 --> 31:56.471
Wouldn't it be easier
to attempt a waltz?

31:56.473 --> 31:59.607
Oh, we could,
but let's face it...

31:59.609 --> 32:02.476
You and I were meant to tango.

33:11.111 --> 33:13.212
Would you like to sit?

33:13.214 --> 33:14.880
No.

33:14.882 --> 33:17.116
Suit yourself.

33:17.118 --> 33:19.684
You certainly seem upbeat.

33:19.686 --> 33:21.186
I'm an upbeat person.

33:21.188 --> 33:24.856
Or at least I was
before I moved into this house,

33:24.858 --> 33:30.529
where I was made to feel
insecure, distrustful, paranoid.

33:31.302 --> 33:36.034
- But that's about to change.
- And why is that?

33:36.036 --> 33:39.137
Because you're going to answer
some questions for me.

33:39.139 --> 33:41.372
Starting with...

33:41.374 --> 33:43.707
Who did Nick kill?

33:43.709 --> 33:46.877
That's how you were
blackmailing him, wasn't it?

33:46.879 --> 33:48.612
You had some sort of evidence,

33:48.614 --> 33:52.683
some proof
you were holding on to?

33:56.121 --> 33:59.089
We had such a nice life.

34:00.482 --> 34:03.393
Ethan and I.

34:03.395 --> 34:07.798
We lived in this home
like it was ours.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.734
Like we mattered.

34:12.938 --> 34:17.739
That was the deal I had
with Nicholas.

34:17.742 --> 34:21.078
And then you showed up
and ruined it all.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.913
You have two seconds
to tell me what I need to know

34:23.915 --> 34:25.983
or I am driving
that security footage

34:25.985 --> 34:27.550
right over to the police.

34:29.587 --> 34:34.290
You keep taking
everything I have.

34:34.292 --> 34:38.293
- It's not fair.
- Please don't do this.

34:38.295 --> 34:39.963
What other choice do I have?

34:39.965 --> 34:41.764
No!

34:41.766 --> 34:44.934
Mom!
What are you doing?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.007
Hi.

34:54.109 --> 34:55.842
Do you have a
couple minutes?

34:55.944 --> 34:57.911
Of course. Come on in.

35:03.050 --> 35:04.718
I just wanted you to know

35:04.720 --> 35:07.388
I've decided to tell the police
about Ethan.

35:07.390 --> 35:09.790
Oh, well, you're doing
the right thing.

35:09.792 --> 35:12.058
And I'm not going to tell them
you stitched him up.

35:12.060 --> 35:13.559
I don't care about that, Val.

35:13.561 --> 35:15.695
All that matters to me
is that you're okay.

35:17.231 --> 35:19.400
Can I ask you something?

35:19.402 --> 35:23.069
Why didn't you turn Ethan in?
I know you don't like him.

35:23.071 --> 35:25.671
I told you I wouldn't.

35:25.673 --> 35:28.008
And I don't break
my promises to you.

35:29.524 --> 35:31.711
Thank you.

35:34.248 --> 35:37.617
Look, uh...

35:37.619 --> 35:40.186
I know that you're kind of
going through a lot right now,

35:40.188 --> 35:41.987
and the timing
really couldn't be worse,

35:41.989 --> 35:43.856
but when you're ready,
I think...

35:49.430 --> 35:52.532
So, does this mean we're...

35:52.534 --> 35:55.435
Shh.
Don't ruin it.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.707
Okay.
Thank you.

36:02.709 --> 36:06.278
- What did the lawyer say?
- He wants to meet with us

36:06.280 --> 36:07.879
right before Valentina
talks to the cops.

36:07.881 --> 36:10.682
I'll meet you at his office.

36:10.684 --> 36:11.951
Great.

36:11.953 --> 36:14.619
So, I should probably take off.

36:14.621 --> 36:17.656
It's getting
past my dinnertime.

36:17.658 --> 36:20.391
Can I make you something?

36:21.728 --> 36:23.528
Well, I did see some chicken
in the fridge.

36:23.530 --> 36:25.396
I'd love some arroz con pollo.

36:25.398 --> 36:26.865
You got it.

36:26.867 --> 36:30.335
Of course, I might need
some help to get this going.

36:30.337 --> 36:33.471
If you could grab me the...

36:34.573 --> 36:37.308
Oh. Thanks.

36:37.310 --> 36:38.609
Sure.

36:41.246 --> 36:42.513
You know...

36:42.515 --> 36:45.483
Helen...
She's not much of a cook.

36:45.485 --> 36:47.184
Aww.
That's too bad.

36:47.186 --> 36:48.418
Javier's a chef.

36:48.420 --> 36:49.987
And handsome, too.

36:49.989 --> 36:51.989
You should have
traded me in years ago.

36:51.991 --> 36:53.591
Oh, shoot,
I have chicken hands.

36:53.593 --> 36:54.825
Could you hand me the...

36:56.427 --> 36:57.995
Thank you.

36:57.997 --> 37:00.397
Again.

37:00.399 --> 37:03.166
So, Javier's a good guy?

37:03.168 --> 37:04.534
He's great.

37:04.536 --> 37:08.938
I mean, it's only been a month,
but so far...

37:08.940 --> 37:10.440
How's Helen?

37:10.442 --> 37:11.608
Terrific.

37:11.610 --> 37:13.910
She never laughs
at my jokes, though.

37:13.912 --> 37:15.278
Mm.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.280
I don't think
she gets my sense of humor.

37:17.282 --> 37:20.016
Papi,
we were married for 20 years.

37:20.018 --> 37:23.285
Believe me when I say...

37:23.287 --> 37:25.454
You're not funny.

37:26.958 --> 37:29.959
Hey, you just
called me "papi."

37:29.961 --> 37:31.961
Old habits.

37:31.963 --> 37:34.130
Still...

37:37.968 --> 37:40.802
You know, I've been carrying
a lot of anger, Pablo.

37:40.804 --> 37:42.804
I know.

37:43.206 --> 37:46.207
But today,
I was thanking God for you.

37:46.209 --> 37:48.009
Really?

37:48.011 --> 37:52.380
I know it was hard for you to
tell Valentina you went to jail.

37:52.382 --> 37:54.482
But I'm so glad you did.

37:54.484 --> 37:56.884
That's what turned her around.

37:56.886 --> 37:59.887
Well, you softened her up
for me.

37:59.889 --> 38:02.890
We always did
make a great team.

38:02.892 --> 38:05.260
We did.

38:26.176 --> 38:30.417
- Have you lost your mind?
- She knows I ran over Nick.

38:30.419 --> 38:32.994
And your solution
is to shoot her?

38:34.523 --> 38:36.356
- Mom.
- Aah!

38:37.694 --> 38:39.359
I apologize
for my mom's insanity.

38:39.361 --> 38:40.360
You okay?

38:40.362 --> 38:43.029
Yeah.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.632
Marisol, there's a book
on that shelf over there...

38:45.634 --> 38:46.766
A big red one.

38:46.768 --> 38:48.034
Could you bring that to me?

38:48.036 --> 38:50.870
Uh... sure.

38:50.872 --> 38:52.272
She's gonna call the police.

38:52.274 --> 38:53.707
You think?
Ethan, please...

38:53.709 --> 38:55.542
I don't have time
for your B.S. right now!

38:55.544 --> 38:57.177
Just sit down
and shut up, okay?!

38:57.179 --> 39:00.346
Uh, is this the one you want?

39:00.348 --> 39:03.249
Yeah. Thanks.

39:05.786 --> 39:08.554
Nick keeps money in here
for emergencies.

39:08.556 --> 39:11.290
He didn't think
I knew about it, but...

39:11.292 --> 39:12.558
Oh, well.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.393
You're taking Nick's money?

39:14.395 --> 39:15.861
I got myself into some trouble.

39:15.863 --> 39:17.396
I need
to disappear for a while.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.198
What kind of trouble?

39:19.200 --> 39:23.336
Ethan, before you go,
I need to ask you something.

39:23.338 --> 39:24.837
Make it quick.

39:24.839 --> 39:27.306
Why...
Why did Nicholas

39:27.308 --> 39:28.874
let your mother live here
all these years?

39:28.876 --> 39:32.244
Did she have something on him?

39:32.246 --> 39:35.247
I'm not sure what it was,
but yeah.

39:35.249 --> 39:37.549
She had something.

39:37.551 --> 39:40.418
Of course,
mom couldn't really tell anyone

39:40.420 --> 39:43.789
because Nick saw her
push Dahlia off the bridge.

39:47.093 --> 39:48.593
We both did.

39:49.895 --> 39:52.764
Why did you
have to tell her that?

39:52.766 --> 39:54.366
Seeing as
I just saved your life,

39:54.368 --> 39:57.235
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
tell the police that I was here.

39:57.237 --> 40:00.472
Ethan, what did you do?

40:02.441 --> 40:06.243
You'll find out soon enough.

40:06.245 --> 40:07.311
Ethan!

40:12.450 --> 40:14.786
I'm so sorry.

40:17.723 --> 40:19.824
For everything.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.661
I wish I cared.

40:31.970 --> 40:35.138
I'm going to
call the police now.

40:35.140 --> 40:39.509
After I'm done,
would you like to call a lawyer?

41:10.173 --> 41:13.175
Hi, I'd like to speak
with detective Figueroa.

41:13.177 --> 41:14.509
It's Marisol Deering.

41:14.511 --> 41:16.773
I-I'm calling in regards
to a hit-and-run.

41:18.349 --> 41:20.582
Yes.
I'll hold.

41:28.691 --> 41:30.359
Opal, no!
