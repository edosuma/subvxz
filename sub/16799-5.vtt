WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.192
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.230 --> 00:05.529
Felon, got a spit bucket here
with your name on it.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.595
Do you remember me?
SHINWELL:
How could I forget?

00:07.640 --> 00:09.528
It's good to see you, Doc.

00:09.570 --> 00:11.128
So, you're a former drug dealer,
correct?

00:12.210 --> 00:13.609
Well, what kind of a name
is Shinwell?

00:13.640 --> 00:15.130
What kind of name is Sherlock?

00:15.180 --> 00:16.204
I was just thinking about

00:16.250 --> 00:17.308
what you asked me the other day

00:17.350 --> 00:18.601
about how to change.

00:18.650 --> 00:19.810
I think

00:19.850 --> 00:20.771
the answer is

00:20.820 --> 00:22.685
to let people help you.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.359
WATSON:
You hate it.

00:28.390 --> 00:29.652
Not really my style.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.487
You know, there are
so many options.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.122
Are you sure that
your partner's cool with me

00:33.160 --> 00:34.627
borrowing his clothes?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.389
I can count on one hand
the number of times

00:36.430 --> 00:37.658
he's opened that trunk.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.724
Besides, it's
for an interview.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.499
He-He'd understand.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.531
Okay, but I'm trying to get
a job working in the kitchen

00:42.570 --> 00:44.333
of a chain restaurant.

00:44.370 --> 00:47.100
My shirt...

00:47.140 --> 00:50.200
may not be more important
than a nice apron.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.616
WATSON:
You know, dress for success.

00:56.620 --> 00:57.746
What kind of hat is this?

00:57.790 --> 00:59.314
Uh...

00:59.360 --> 01:00.657
if you like it,
you can have it.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.681
Sherlock never wears it.

01:13.870 --> 01:16.407
That's nice.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.464
You like it?

01:17.510 --> 01:18.738
I like it.

01:18.770 --> 01:19.873
Well, we have

01:19.910 --> 01:22.140
a winner.
This is my fifth interview

01:22.180 --> 01:22.805
in the last two weeks

01:22.850 --> 01:24.272
and so far, I'm 0 and four.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.278
You really
think I didn't

01:26.320 --> 01:29.244
get those other jobs because
they didn't like my shirt?

01:29.290 --> 01:30.746
I'm ex-con.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.587
All the clothes in the world
ain't gonna hide that.

01:32.620 --> 01:34.110
Listen...
all we need

01:34.160 --> 01:35.252
is one person who's willing

01:35.290 --> 01:36.552
to give you a chance.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.189
You know, I think there's
a jacket down there

01:41.230 --> 01:43.460
that's gonna look
great with that.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.162
I'll be right back.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.504
Yeah, I know.

01:51.540 --> 01:54.634
It stinks, sweetie, but...

01:54.680 --> 01:56.272
Bob wants all

01:56.310 --> 02:01.247
the TPS reports in first thing,
so I am going to be

02:01.280 --> 02:05.216
stuck here in the office
all night.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.386
Dinner?

02:07.420 --> 02:08.853
(chuckles)

02:08.890 --> 02:10.448
Eh, I don't know.

02:10.490 --> 02:13.618
I'll probably just end up
ordering in.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.457
(chuckles)

02:15.500 --> 02:16.467
(jazz music plays)

02:16.500 --> 02:17.467
Oops, sorry.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.195
Ugh, stupid computer.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.538
Uh, I've been having trouble
with the volume.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.299
(music stops)

02:23.340 --> 02:25.638
I never said I didn't like jazz,
I said I...

02:25.670 --> 02:27.228
(gunshot booms)

02:27.280 --> 02:28.702
Uh, that was...

02:28.740 --> 02:30.173
(footsteps running)

02:30.210 --> 02:31.177
...that was nothing.

02:31.210 --> 02:32.177
Uh, that was Howie.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.869
He...

02:33.920 --> 02:37.788
He, uh, closed a big deal today,
so he...

02:37.820 --> 02:39.754
popped a bottle of champagne.
(gunshot fires)

02:39.790 --> 02:41.189
(glass shatters)

02:41.220 --> 02:41.788
(gasps)

02:44.230 --> 02:45.219
*

03:17.630 --> 03:20.519
BELL:
Victim's name is Damien Novak.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.323
A little after 8:00 pm.
last night, he was shot twice

03:22.370 --> 03:25.999
in a motel parking lot
in Jackson Heights.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.759
HOLMES:
Shot from behind.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.268
Figure he was
making a run for it.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.403
First bullet caught
him in the shoulder.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.601
The second caught him
square in the back,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.244
sent him
through a window.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.407
Any witnesses?

03:38.450 --> 03:39.849
Guests heard the shots,
but no one saw what happened.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.017
Other than
the lobby area,

03:41.050 --> 03:42.608
there's no
security cameras.

03:42.650 --> 03:43.742
It's the kind of place
that prides itself

03:43.790 --> 03:45.382
on its anonymity.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.388
No-tell motel.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.409
Was he a guest?

03:48.460 --> 03:49.427
As far as we
could tell, no.

03:49.460 --> 03:50.722
He hadn't checked in.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.398
But who knows?
He may have been

03:52.430 --> 03:53.454
on his way to
the front desk

03:53.500 --> 03:54.455
when the shooter
approached him.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.467
Wrists were bound.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.524
Zip tie

03:58.570 --> 03:59.537
in the bin
behind you.

03:59.570 --> 04:00.889
So, you think this was

04:00.940 --> 04:02.430
some sort of botched kidnapping?

04:02.470 --> 04:03.664
Novak was married.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.665
If he was going

04:04.710 --> 04:05.768
to the motel to meet up

04:05.810 --> 04:06.834
with someone other
than his wife,

04:06.880 --> 04:07.938
it's possible
he was stopped

04:07.980 --> 04:09.402
by an angry husband,

04:09.450 --> 04:11.509
a boyfriend.
That guy either wanted

04:11.550 --> 04:12.778
to scare him
or take hIm somewhere.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.380
Either way,
Novak took off

04:15.420 --> 04:16.444
and the perp opened fire.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.549
You don't think Novak's wife
could've done this?

04:18.590 --> 04:20.956
She alibi'd out when
the notification was made.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.014
I'm leaving here

04:22.060 --> 04:23.379
to talk to her
right after this.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.454
Not looking forward

04:24.490 --> 04:25.684
to floating the theory

04:25.730 --> 04:26.958
that her husband
was unfaithful.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.922
It's even worse than you think.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.829
Mr. Novak went to the motel
to rendezvous

04:31.870 --> 04:33.861
with an adolescent girl
that he met online.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.390
He's a sex predator.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.634
Last night, he was targeted

04:36.670 --> 04:38.035
by someone who reviles
such individuals,

04:38.070 --> 04:39.628
a predator of predators,

04:39.680 --> 04:41.079
if you will.
Couldn't be more obvious.

04:41.110 --> 04:43.806
Unless all of that is etched

04:43.850 --> 04:45.977
in teeny, tiny lettering
on that zip tie,

04:46.010 --> 04:48.547
I'm not sure how you
got there from here.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.549
Mr. Novak is not the first
predator to be preyed upon.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.885
It's happened exactly
five times before.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.451
DISTORTED MALE VOICE:
Say hi

04:56.490 --> 04:57.855
to the folks at home, Jerome.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.824
(crying): There's been
some sort of mistake.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.521
I'm not who you think I am.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.461
DISTORTED MALE VOICE:
I know exactly who you are.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.730
Dr. Jerome Chun, age 45.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.406
And you came here to have sex
with a 15-year-old girl.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.432
No, no.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.345
Stop it here.
Give away the ending.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.473
Dr. Chun admits that
he went to that motel

05:19.520 --> 05:20.441
to have sex with a minor.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.572
You said there's four

05:21.620 --> 05:22.848
more videos like this?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.482
I've seen
the filmmaker's

05:24.520 --> 05:25.839
entire oeuvre.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.448
On five separate occasions,
he used the popular

05:27.490 --> 05:28.912
dating Web site TrueRomantix

05:28.960 --> 05:30.359
_to lure men
With a proc|IVIty

05:30.390 --> 05:31.459
for underage girls.

05:31.490 --> 05:32.593
How exactly
did he do that?

05:32.630 --> 05:34.552
By pretending to be one.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.953
He's a catfish.
He says he's one thing

05:36.000 --> 05:37.024
when he's really another.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.025
And the MO. is

05:38.070 --> 05:39.025
pretty simple, really.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.435
He creates a phony profile

05:40.470 --> 05:42.506
and claims to be
an 18-year-old girl,

05:42.540 --> 05:44.508
then he strikes up conversations

05:44.540 --> 05:45.837
with lonely, middle-aged guys.

05:45.870 --> 05:47.030
When the young woman

05:47.080 --> 05:48.638
has a suitor on her hook,

05:48.680 --> 05:50.568
she then reveals
that she misrepresented

05:50.610 --> 05:53.477
her age in order to gain
access to the site.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.476
She's not really 18, she's 15.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.511
Now, it's safe to assume,
at this point,

05:57.550 --> 05:58.847
some men fall away.

05:58.890 --> 06:00.448
Others do not.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.514
Those are the guys
that she invites

06:01.560 --> 06:03.084
to meet her face-to-face.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.859
The ones that we would
claSSIfy as predators.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.027
On the night of their
respective trysts,

06:06.060 --> 06:07.596
Dr. Chun and four other

06:07.630 --> 06:10.098
tricked men were not greeted
by a pubescent girl,

06:10.130 --> 06:12.394
but by a vigilante
with a camera.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.567
And after he shot the video,
he shot the men?

06:14.600 --> 06:15.862
BROOKS:
No, he let them go.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.458
Posted the videos online.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.603
So, something went wrong
last night.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.039
Damien Novak fought back.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.479
The guy shot him.

06:22.510 --> 06:23.772
Uh, maybe, maybe not.

06:23.810 --> 06:25.471
Detective B_rooks
IS not conVInced

06:25.510 --> 06:26.613
that Mr. Novak's murder

06:26.650 --> 06:27.639
was the work of the same man.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.715
The catfish has been

06:28.750 --> 06:30.115
exclusive to New Jersey.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.742
I was keeping tabs
on the case from afar.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.883
All five videos got shot

06:33.920 --> 06:35.148
in my jurisdiction.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.418
I have questioned each
of the pervs

06:36.460 --> 06:37.427
that have lived to tell

06:37.460 --> 06:38.586
the tale and
none of them

06:38.630 --> 06:40.495
ever said anything
about a gun.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.998
The guy that lured them
used his size against them.

06:43.030 --> 06:43.997
Beat them into
sumeSSIon.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.725
Is this supposed to be

06:45.770 --> 06:47.658
a painter's mask?
Between that

06:47.700 --> 06:49.839
and the beatings, uh,
the light he shines

06:49.870 --> 06:51.667
in these guys' faces,
we got almost zilch

06:51.710 --> 06:53.177
in the description department.

06:53.210 --> 06:54.677
Caucasian.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.746
Could be as young as 20
or as old as 45.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.668
That being said,
in each case,

06:58.710 --> 06:59.972
the wrists
of the victims--

07:00.020 --> 07:01.817
and I use that term
as loosely as I can--

07:01.850 --> 07:04.045
were bound _with
a red zrp tie.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.149
The tie used
to bind Mr. Novak

07:06.190 --> 07:07.748
is a perfect match.

07:07.790 --> 07:09.451
Between it and the
fact that he was shot

07:09.490 --> 07:10.525
outside a cheap motel,

07:10.560 --> 07:11.754
I cannot help but think

07:11.790 --> 07:13.621
that your catfish
has migrated north.

07:13.660 --> 07:14.922
Well, how do you
explain the gun?

07:14.960 --> 07:16.564
Mr. Novak was especially fit.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.761
Perhaps the killer felt the need
to bring insurance.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.597
Do we have any idea
if Novak had a thing

07:20.640 --> 07:22.460
for underage girls?

07:22.510 --> 07:23.704
Watson and Marcus

07:23.740 --> 07:25.560
are with his wife now.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.237
Perhaps she'll be able
to shed some light

07:27.280 --> 07:29.475
on what kind of man he was.

07:30.510 --> 07:32.512
No.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.480
What you're saying,
it doesn't make sense.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.559
His sister, Ivy...

07:40.590 --> 07:41.716
she was hurt like that

07:41.760 --> 07:44.081
when she was a teenager
by a family friend.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.950
It happened

07:45.990 --> 07:49.027
a long time ago,
but Damien never got over it.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.027
I know this is

07:50.070 --> 07:51.697
very upsetting...

07:51.730 --> 07:52.890
but like

07:52.940 --> 07:54.737
Detective Bell said,
there is evidence

07:54.770 --> 07:56.635
that suggests that
your husband was being

07:56.670 --> 07:58.501
targeted by someone
who is hunting

07:58.540 --> 08:01.008
sexual predators,
so we need to know everything.

08:03.710 --> 08:06.645
Tell them about
the pictures.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.874
What pictures?

08:10.750 --> 08:12.957
A few months ago,
I found something strange

08:12.990 --> 08:14.252
on Damien's laptop.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.185
A file with photos of women.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.755
They were girls.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.256
They looked young.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.818
But when I asked
Damien about them,

08:23.870 --> 08:25.019
he said they
were in college.

08:25.070 --> 08:27.061
Sorority sisters
or something.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.068
He was training them
at the gym where he worked.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.159
My sister has always tried
to see the best in people

08:31.210 --> 08:32.632
and she's been that way
since we were kids,

08:32.680 --> 08:34.671
but Damien took advantage.

08:34.710 --> 08:35.836
What do you mean?

08:35.880 --> 08:36.869
The last few months

08:36.910 --> 08:38.241
he's been working late

08:38.280 --> 08:40.168
at the gym a lot and
Stephanie was worried

08:40.220 --> 08:41.869
that he might be
having an affair,

08:41.920 --> 08:45.617
so I talked to him and
he swore up and down

08:45.650 --> 08:47.811
that he wasn't cheating.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.749
God help me, I
believed him and...

08:50.790 --> 08:53.054
I got to think he was doing
something much worse,

08:53.100 --> 08:55.625
that he was
stalking these girls

08:55.660 --> 08:57.093
or-or meeting up
with other perverts

08:57.130 --> 08:58.165
and exchanging pictures...

08:58.200 --> 08:59.929
Garrett, stop it!

08:59.970 --> 09:03.235
We're gonna have to take a look
at Damien's laptop.

09:03.270 --> 09:06.899
You can, but...

09:06.940 --> 09:08.737
but after I talked to him
about what I found

09:08.780 --> 09:11.305
he password-protected it.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.978
I don't know
how to log on.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.339
If it's the pictures
you want to see,

09:15.380 --> 09:16.586
I can pull them
up right here.

09:18.790 --> 09:22.658
Stephanie... sent me the
file when she found it.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.694
MAN: _
TrueRomantix

09:35.740 --> 09:36.968
will not violate

09:37.010 --> 09:38.830
the privacy of its customers.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.838
Oh, well, I'm just asking
for access to the accounts

09:40.880 --> 09:43.701
of the men who were lured
and shamed usmg your srte.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.274
I want to trace their profiles
back to the ones

09:45.310 --> 09:46.277
used by their attacker.

09:46.310 --> 09:47.675
Or would you
rather that they

09:47.720 --> 09:49.017
continued stalking
your clientele?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.359
The five men in those videos
that got posted,

09:54.390 --> 09:55.812
they swore to a man
that they were

09:55.860 --> 09:57.225
victims of mistaken identity.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.023
Yes, well, it's easier
to play the victim

09:59.060 --> 10:00.027
than the pervert, isn't it?

10:00.060 --> 10:01.857
See, this is what I mean.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.162
You've already made up
your mind.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.895
Five loyal members
of our community

10:04.930 --> 10:06.761
are "perverts."

10:06.800 --> 10:08.358
Why? Because the crazy man

10:08.400 --> 10:10.709
with a camera says so?
Did you not think
it was strange

10:10.740 --> 10:12.401
that not one of them
would show the police

10:12.440 --> 10:13.998
the correspondence
that they engaged in?

10:14.040 --> 10:15.871
No, because
they have a right...

10:15.910 --> 10:17.741
To privacy.
Yes, I'm well aware.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.304
As do the TrueRomantix
subscribers

10:19.350 --> 10:20.908
who use your site
to engage in affairs.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.815
And that's what you're really
worried about, isn't it?

10:22.850 --> 10:24.386
'Cause once word gets out
that you're willing

10:24.420 --> 10:26.388
to bend the rules, the
whole horny house of cards

10:26.420 --> 10:27.682
comes tumbling down.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.755
They move on to another site

10:28.790 --> 10:30.257
_ with stricter
privacy protections.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.758
The Jersey City PD
asked very nicely

10:32.800 --> 10:33.824
for the same access
that you are.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.748
We said no.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.392
So, they asked not so nicely.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.897
Now it's in the courts' hands.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.898
You can wait for a decision
If you want,

10:40.940 --> 10:42.339
but I got to tell you...

10:42.370 --> 10:44.338
I'll take our lawyers
over theirs any day.

10:44.370 --> 10:47.806
If you don't mind,
I have a lunch meeting.

10:52.980 --> 10:56.074
You want to help me, don't you?
Excuse me?

10:56.120 --> 10:58.042
When I was pressuring your boss,
you retrieved a document

10:58.090 --> 10:59.785
from a printer just
a few feet behind us.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.913
Despite the fact that there's
another printer

11:01.960 --> 11:03.780
of higher quality
and faster output

11:03.830 --> 11:05.149
much closer to your desk.

11:05.190 --> 11:06.691
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:06.730 --> 11:08.254
You then disposed of said
document without even

11:08.300 --> 11:10.860
reading it. You were attempting
to eavesdrop, weren't you?

11:10.900 --> 11:13.095
You don't like him very much.
You seemed especially put out

11:13.140 --> 11:16.098
when he spoke of the company's
obligation to protect perverts.

11:16.140 --> 11:19.166
You take anti-anxiety
medication.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.906
You hate your job?
Are you trying to get me fired?

11:21.940 --> 11:23.908
Your dual 1440p monitors
and your calloused fingertips

11:23.950 --> 11:25.770
suggest you make
your living writing code.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.277
You are a programmer,
so getting me the data I need

11:27.320 --> 11:28.912
would be relatively easy.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.817
This place is the worst.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.488
My coworkers act like
they're curing world hunger,

11:36.520 --> 11:39.125
and my boss is literally like
a bad guy out of a comic book.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.025
Yeah.

11:42.260 --> 11:45.229
Give me your e-mail address.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.295
I'll send you whatever you need.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.035
(pen scratching on paper)

11:50.410 --> 11:51.809
Hey.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.137
What are you doing here?

11:53.180 --> 11:54.738
Waiting for you.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.907
Sherlock's not home?
He IS.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.975
Said I could wait inside,
but he's, you know...

11:59.010 --> 12:00.113
intense.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.041
You think?

12:03.090 --> 12:06.787
Wanted to return
the clothes I borrowed.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.385
Oh. You got the
job, so you don't

12:10.430 --> 12:13.456
need to do any
more interviews?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.991
I'm pretty sure I could've
wore a barrel and two straps,

12:16.030 --> 12:18.999
and it wouldn't have
made no difference.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.996
Apparently, my experience

12:22.040 --> 12:23.860
in the prison cafeteria

12:23.910 --> 12:25.969
is not a "real qualification."

12:26.010 --> 12:28.331
The guy didn't say it, but...

12:28.380 --> 12:31.372
he didn't want nothing
to do with an ex-con.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.008
I'm sorry.

12:35.050 --> 12:37.280
It is what it is.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.948
Why don't you just hold
onto them just in case?

12:42.990 --> 12:46.027
I think I'm gonna take a break
from the job hunt for a while.

12:46.060 --> 12:48.255
Try to get more hours
at the gym.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.428
You hate that place.

12:51.470 --> 12:54.837
(chuckles)
Work is work, right?

12:56.910 --> 12:59.470
Have a good night, Doc.

12:59.510 --> 13:02.070
You, too.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.847
(door opens, closes)

13:08.580 --> 13:09.911
You saw Shinwell?

13:09.950 --> 13:10.917
I did.

13:10.950 --> 13:13.009
I offered him to wait in here,
but he claimed

13:13.060 --> 13:15.415
to prefer the stoop.
I don't think he likes me.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.985
I have a feeling it has
more to do with the...

13:18.030 --> 13:19.429
pervert family tree.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.121
So, did you get

13:21.160 --> 13:22.457
everything you needed
at TrueRomantix?

13:22.500 --> 13:23.967
Almost.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.194
There's no record
of Damien Novak

13:25.230 --> 13:27.039
having been a customer there.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.037
Perhaps our predator-
predator lured him

13:28.070 --> 13:30.903
on a different dating site.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.829
WATSON: Hmm, so we still
don't know who this guy is.
We do not.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.474
He is, in fact, a more cautious
catfish than we realized.

13:36.510 --> 13:39.445
The New Jersey Police assumed
that he'd use the same

13:39.480 --> 13:41.118
phony profile to bait
all of his victims,

13:41.150 --> 13:42.310
but that was incorrect.

13:42.350 --> 13:44.284
He used a different one
each time.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.947
And all five of them

13:45.990 --> 13:48.379
were paid for on credit
cards pilfered in the mail.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.479
They can't be
traced back to him.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.450
So, you're analyzing his chats

13:53.500 --> 13:56.458
with these men when he was
pretending to be a teenage girl.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.388
Mm. Perhaps you'll have
better luck than I did.

13:58.430 --> 14:00.933
I've been at it for hours,
and all I can say for certain

14:00.970 --> 14:03.461
is that he is an expert
manipulator of perverts.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.102
He baits them with ease.

14:05.140 --> 14:08.109
I'd go so far as
to call him a master baiter.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.402
Of course you would.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.101
HOLMES: It's clear now
that none of these men

14:11.150 --> 14:13.015
were the victim
of mistaken identity.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.312
According to the transcripts,

14:14.350 --> 14:17.114
they were all quite keen
on the idea of having sex

14:17.150 --> 14:18.344
with a teenager.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.052
If our quarry hadn't crossed
the line into murder last night,

14:21.090 --> 14:22.648
I'd be quite tempted to let him

14:22.690 --> 14:25.181
continue his attacks.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.561
Oh, you know, Shinwell
lost out on another job.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.192
Sorry to hear that.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.265
You know, I was thinking,
instead of trying to work

14:35.300 --> 14:37.666
for other people, maybe
he should work for himself.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.234
You think he should
be a tradesman.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.204
Well, tradesmen need to be
taught their trades.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.242
And finding a willing teacher
might be just as difficult
(printing)

14:43.280 --> 14:44.508
as finding a willing employer.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.006
Well, I thought
I could be his teacher.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.608
I mean, what we do
is a trade, right?

14:47.650 --> 14:49.345
You want to teach him
to be a detective?

14:49.380 --> 14:51.086
We've done it before.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.054
You're referring to Kitty.
Kitty, who never graduated,

14:53.090 --> 14:54.955
burned a man's face off
and fled the country.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.151
She had a lot of baggage.
He doesn't?

14:57.190 --> 14:59.454
Look, the point is, you taught
me how to be a detective.

14:59.490 --> 15:02.357
I think it worked out
pretty well, right?

15:02.400 --> 15:05.096
Are these the phony profiles
the catfish used?
Yeah.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.324
The accompanying
photographs, however,

15:06.370 --> 15:08.133
are stock images
taken from the Internet.

15:08.170 --> 15:10.138
No way to trace them
back to him, either.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.535
(calling): Actually,
I think there is a way.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.174
I've seen those girls before.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.375
Where'd you get these?

15:22.420 --> 15:23.682
Damien Novak's wife found them

15:23.720 --> 15:25.483
on his laptop months ago.

15:28.190 --> 15:29.987
So, you no longer think
he was a sex predator.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.624
I think he was the catfish.

15:32.660 --> 15:33.649
*

15:39.470 --> 15:42.234
You think these profiles were
created by our victim, Novak.

15:42.270 --> 15:43.669
He was the one
who tricked all those guys

15:43.710 --> 15:45.200
who wanted to sleep with minors,

15:45.240 --> 15:47.401
he was the one
who made the videos?

15:47.440 --> 15:48.976
He fits the profile.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.170
His _sister was
a Victim of abuse,

15:50.210 --> 15:51.609
and even though their
descriptions varied,

15:51.650 --> 15:53.242
all five men who were shamed

15:53.280 --> 15:55.248
said their attacker _
overpowered them easrly.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.248
Novak was built
like a linebacker.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.541
Well, there's another
possibility:

16:01.120 --> 16:03.588
He fell for all five of the
vigilante's phony girls,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.621
cut and pasted their photos
into a file on his laptop

16:05.660 --> 16:07.628
so he can always have them.
The thing is,

16:07.660 --> 16:09.150
there were eight photographs
in that file.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.667
Sherlock and I worked
backwards and found

16:10.700 --> 16:12.463
three more profiles.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.697
So, these five were used to
catch the men who were shamed.

16:15.740 --> 16:17.207
After that, they
were deactivated.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.458
These three are still active.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.705
And we're pretty sure were used
as hooks in the water

16:21.740 --> 16:23.207
to catch new prey.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.707
BELL: If we're right,
the only way Novak

16:25.750 --> 16:28.275
would've had these is if he were
the one doing the hunting.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.141
GREGSON: So you're saying he
went to that motel two night ago

16:31.190 --> 16:32.543
to humiliate a new predator,

16:32.590 --> 16:36.082
only the tables got turned,
his prey pulled a gun.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.156
What about the mask?
All of the guys who got jumped

16:38.190 --> 16:40.454
said the perp was wearing
a painter's mask?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.491
Novak wasn't wearing one
when he got shot.

16:42.530 --> 16:45.658
I went back to the motel
this morning, found that

16:45.700 --> 16:48.134
in a gutter across the street.
Killer might've tossed it.

16:48.170 --> 16:50.263
Or it might've blown away.
It was windy that night.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.631
BELL: The lab swabbed
the inside for DNA.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.570
We're expecting it to come
back a match for Novak.

16:54.610 --> 16:57.670
All we got to do is ID
the guy he was supposed to meet.

16:57.710 --> 17:00.042
We'll have our killer.
Actually,

17:00.080 --> 17:01.741
we ID'd him. As it turns out,

17:01.780 --> 17:05.284
he is the one guy we're pretty
sure didn't kill Novak.

17:05.320 --> 17:08.255
BELL: Gonna save us
all some time, Mr. Utz.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.827
There is zero point denying
you went to the motel

17:10.860 --> 17:14.455
the other night to sleep with
a girl you thought was only 15.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.650
We read the messages you sent
Kendra on TrueRomantix.

17:16.700 --> 17:20.136
They were pretty explicit.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.138
You talk to your wife like that?

17:22.170 --> 17:24.263
You're positive
she doesn't exist?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.459
WATSON:
We told you.

17:25.510 --> 17:27.569
Kendra was a man
named Damien Novak.

17:27.610 --> 17:29.669
The same Damien Novak
who came crashing

17:29.710 --> 17:32.349
through your window.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.610
I'm sorry,

17:34.650 --> 17:35.639
it's just...

17:35.680 --> 17:37.216
I loved her.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.214
(sniffles)

17:40.260 --> 17:41.784
I didn't know.

17:41.820 --> 17:44.357
Obviously,
I didn't know.

17:44.390 --> 17:47.689
I had nothing to do
with what happened to that man.

17:47.730 --> 17:49.823
We believe you.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.226
Whoever killed him
knew what he was.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.794
They laid in wait.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.535
You'd have to be an idiot
to rent a room

17:55.570 --> 17:58.232
in your own name and then
blow a guy away outside of it.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.430
GREGSON:
That said...

17:59.470 --> 18:02.132
you kept things from us.

18:02.180 --> 18:05.240
It makes us wonder what
else you kept from us.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.419
Maybe you saw
or heard something.

18:08.350 --> 18:10.386
You did, didn't you?

18:12.620 --> 18:13.814
(sniffles)

18:16.360 --> 18:18.681
_If this conversation
IS gonng to continue,

18:18.730 --> 18:20.618
I want you to guarantee
that you won't

18:20.660 --> 18:22.457
tell my wife about Kendra.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.297
You said it yourselves.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.888
She wasn't real.
She was a figment.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.466
There is nothing illegal

18:27.500 --> 18:29.331
about wanting to be...

18:29.370 --> 18:31.759
with a figment.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.608
I didn't break
a single law that night.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.404
In fact, if someone
hadn't intervened,

18:37.450 --> 18:38.747
I would be a victim.

18:38.780 --> 18:39.906
Mr. Utz...

18:39.950 --> 18:41.349
Deal.

18:44.690 --> 18:48.410
A few seconds after
the second shot,

18:48.460 --> 18:51.327
a car tore out
of the parking lot.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.249
It was... a white Toyota.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.655
Think it might've been
the killer.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.897
That isn't helpful?

18:59.930 --> 19:02.660
It might be.
I'm just wondering, why didn't

19:02.700 --> 19:04.406
you mention this
the other night?

19:04.440 --> 19:05.839
It's not_ like it
would've given away

19:05.870 --> 19:08.373
your real reason
for being at that motel.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.901
Because...

19:10.950 --> 19:13.441
I didn't see it happen then.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.471
I saw it after.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.341
What do you mean, after?

19:18.390 --> 19:20.517
*

19:22.460 --> 19:24.257
This guy was gonna
record himself

19:24.290 --> 19:26.349
having sex
with a 15-year-old.

19:26.390 --> 19:27.550
(gunshot over video)

19:30.300 --> 19:31.426
WATSON:
Oh, there.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.368
(clicks phone)

19:35.240 --> 19:37.902
Can‘t make out
the license plate.

19:37.940 --> 19:39.908
It's hard to tell
if it's the shooter driving,

19:39.940 --> 19:42.306
or if it's just someone
who got spooked by the gunshots.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.604
We have a list of the other
people who were staying

19:44.650 --> 19:46.606
at the motel that night.
I'll run their names

19:46.650 --> 19:49.312
through DMV, see if
anyone owns a white Camry.

19:49.350 --> 19:52.387
(door opens)
I'll wrap up with Mr. Utz.

19:52.420 --> 19:53.455
Hey, you weren't serious before,
right?

19:53.490 --> 19:54.957
About not telling his wife?

19:54.990 --> 19:56.617
I gave my word.

19:56.660 --> 19:57.922
I'm not telling her a thing.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.359
(door opens)

19:59.390 --> 20:00.721
What I am gonna do

20:00.760 --> 20:02.455
is I'm gonna arrest him.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.560
Luring a child-- whether she
ends up being a figment or not--

20:05.600 --> 20:08.569
is a class E felony.
We have written proof.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.400
His wife ends up finding out
about it on the news?

20:12.440 --> 20:14.601
That's on him.

20:16.510 --> 20:17.704
(clicks phone)

20:17.750 --> 20:18.705
* Rico

20:18.750 --> 20:20.445
* Taco, taco, taco *

20:20.480 --> 20:23.745
* Taco, taco, taco, taco
* Taco. *

20:23.790 --> 20:25.644
HOLMES: Don't get comfortable,
Watson, 'cause we're leaving.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.487
Why are you listening
to old jingles?

20:27.520 --> 20:30.284
As we discussed, no one had more
motive to kill Damien Novak

20:30.330 --> 20:32.525
than the five men
he successfully shamed.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.891
Based on the work
I did this morning,

20:33.930 --> 20:35.591
only one of them
could have shot him.

20:35.630 --> 20:37.598
Jerome Chun? No.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.427
He attempted suicide
after the police questioned him

20:39.470 --> 20:41.290
about the video
that he appeared in.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.308
He's been in a coma ever since.

20:43.340 --> 20:44.364
Reuben Welker?
Impossible.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.968
In the wake of his shaming,

20:46.010 --> 20:47.830
he was arrested for embezzling
from his construction firm.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.438
He's serving
a five-year prison sentence.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.447
Ignacio Gomez
and Shane Fitzhugh,

20:50.480 --> 20:51.640
they both fled the country

20:51.680 --> 20:53.477
after Novak exposed them.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.647
So that just leaves Jack McGill.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.580
HOLMES: He's an ad man,
or at least he was.

20:57.620 --> 21:00.509
Managing partner of one of
New York's largest agencies.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.312
These jingles are all
from campaigns

21:02.360 --> 21:03.657
he mounted in the 19805.

21:03.690 --> 21:07.421
A year ago, a female employee
of his sued him

21:07.460 --> 21:08.757
for sexual harassment.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.597
Case was on the verge
of going to trial,

21:10.630 --> 21:12.928
and he was caught
in Novak's trap.

21:12.970 --> 21:15.564
So, after the video surfaced,
the company fired him

21:15.600 --> 21:16.669
and then settled the suit.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.928
His wife then filed for divorce.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.005
Took him to the cleaners.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.405
So, he didn't just get shamed,

21:20.440 --> 21:21.429
he lost everything.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.300
Mm, not everything.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.749
So many boats out here.

21:24.780 --> 21:25.940
How are we supposed
to find the one

21:25.980 --> 21:27.675
that _Jack_ McGill
hveSIn?

21:27.720 --> 21:28.675
Pretty sure
it's that one.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.481
You're positive this is
the guy who tortured me?

21:33.520 --> 21:34.748
That's him.
Good.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.520
I'm glad the son of a bitch
is dead.

21:38.590 --> 21:39.227
So, where were you

21:39.260 --> 21:41.558
two nights ago, around 8:00?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.488
Right here.

21:43.530 --> 21:44.599
I'm always right here.

21:44.630 --> 21:45.858
Haven't been able
to show my face

21:45.900 --> 21:47.561
in public for months,

21:47.600 --> 21:49.864
not without someone
threatening to kill me.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.607
Can anyone confirm
that you were here?

21:52.640 --> 21:53.629
(chuckles)

21:53.680 --> 21:54.704
Who'd you have in mind?

21:54.740 --> 21:55.968
My wife?

21:56.010 --> 21:57.773
She lives in Boca now.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.402
My kids?

21:59.450 --> 22:00.542
They won't talk to me.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.639
Not even when they
need money. Which,

22:02.680 --> 22:04.489
before I was branded
a diaper sniper,

22:04.520 --> 22:06.943
was pretty much all the time.

22:06.990 --> 22:09.356
The only visitor
I've had recently

22:09.390 --> 22:12.553
is the little turd
who vandalized my home.

22:12.590 --> 22:15.627
You realize you're not making
yourself any less of a suspect.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.628
You want to throw me
in jail, go ahead.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.888
I won't fight you.

22:19.930 --> 22:22.034
Tried that the last time _
someone accused me of something

22:22.070 --> 22:24.800
I didn't do.
Won't make that mistake again.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.139
We were able to access
your TrueRomantix account.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.807
We read the messages
that you sent

22:29.840 --> 22:31.569
to a 14-year-old girl
named Ella May.

22:31.610 --> 22:34.147
That's great.
I read them, too.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.818
I just didn't write them.

22:35.850 --> 22:38.819
I never even_ had an account
on that ridiculous Site.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.159
So you still claim that someone
created a phony profile

22:41.190 --> 22:42.748
and posed as you.

22:42.790 --> 22:45.987
I was a founding partner
of a top ad agency. You really

22:46.030 --> 22:48.021
think if I was gonna
seduce a teenage girl,

22:48.060 --> 22:50.620
I'd do it in a public forum

22:50.670 --> 22:52.626
using my own name and picture?

22:52.670 --> 22:54.592
You told the police you were
lured to a motel in East Orange

22:54.640 --> 22:56.562
by a phone call
from a mystery man

22:56.600 --> 22:58.431
who alleged to have
information that would,

22:58.470 --> 23:00.006
uh, help you in the lawsuit
you were fighting?

23:00.040 --> 23:02.179
Right. Only when I got there,

23:02.210 --> 23:03.848
I got jumped
by a masked psychopath

23:03.880 --> 23:05.541
with a camera.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.639
He beat on me for over an hour.

23:07.680 --> 23:10.114
Said he would kill me
if I didn't confess my sins.

23:10.150 --> 23:12.846
But you know what?
I never did.

23:12.890 --> 23:16.519
'Cause I didn't do any of those
things he accused me of.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.154
After you were fired
you told anyone who would listen

23:19.190 --> 23:21.158
that the woman who was suing you

23:21.200 --> 23:22.929
was the one
who set you up.

23:22.960 --> 23:26.123
Yvette Ingram. Who, by the way,
I did not sexually harass.

23:26.170 --> 23:28.559
That's a lie.
No, it's a good thing.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.136
I was beginning to think
you were unreadable.

23:30.170 --> 23:31.660
Yvette was desperate.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.598
The depositions were
not going well for her.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.505
She knew if the case
went to trial,

23:35.540 --> 23:36.677
the jury would side with me.

23:36.710 --> 23:38.871
Her only hope was

23:38.910 --> 23:41.219
to force a pretrial settlement.
And when that "video"

23:41.250 --> 23:44.185
of me surfaced, she got one.

23:44.220 --> 23:46.586
'Cause a man who would prey on
a minor is more than capable of

23:46.620 --> 23:50.056
harassing a grown woman, right?

23:50.090 --> 23:53.548
The dead guy, Novak--
he was just a weapon.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.727
Yvette's the one
who pointed him at me.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.159
Say he's telling the truth.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.895
That would mean
that Yvette Ingram

23:58.930 --> 24:00.568
beat Damien Novak
at his own game.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.965
She catfished a catfish.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.560
To do that she would have
to know that Ella Mae

24:04.610 --> 24:05.963
is one of his aliases.

24:06.010 --> 24:08.035
But how? We've already
established he doesn't ever

24:08.080 --> 24:09.877
use the same alias twice.

24:09.910 --> 24:11.468
Perhaps they
know each other.

24:11.510 --> 24:12.772
Perhaps she
shared his secret.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.778
Perhaps she divined it
without him realizing.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.947
Well, it's worth looking
for a link between them, right?

24:16.980 --> 24:18.948
It is. You know, I've
been thinking about

24:18.990 --> 24:20.787
your idea regarding Shinwell.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.754
If you want to attempt
to teach him our trade,

24:22.790 --> 24:24.519
I'm not gonna stop you,
but I'd be remiss

24:24.560 --> 24:25.879
if I didn't say
I-I don't see it.

24:25.930 --> 24:27.522
See what?

24:27.560 --> 24:29.596
He isn't a detective.
He wants a job.

24:29.630 --> 24:32.224
But what we do,
it's not a job.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.636
It's a calling.
We were born to do this work.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.228
You were born to it.
I learned it.

24:36.270 --> 24:38.101
You disagree
it's what you

24:38.140 --> 24:39.767
were meant to
do all along?

24:39.810 --> 24:41.801
Well, so, what,
Shinwell was meant to be

24:41.840 --> 24:43.649
a-a janitor in a boxing gym?

24:43.680 --> 24:45.147
I just know he's not
meant to be a detective.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.647
Well, you haven't spent
that much time with him.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.840
(phone rings)
Because, typically, I need to

24:47.880 --> 24:49.074
do that in order
to know someone?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.645
You kno...

24:51.690 --> 24:53.658
Hey, you've got us both.

24:53.690 --> 24:56.659
Thought you'd want to know
CCS finally cracked the password

24:56.690 --> 24:58.829
on Novak's laptop.
And?

24:58.860 --> 25:01.795
It's a gold mine. He was
our shamer, no doubt about it.

25:01.830 --> 25:04.526
We found links to all eight

25:04.570 --> 25:06.720
phony TrueRomantix profiles
you dug up.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.863
But there was a surprise, too--

25:08.900 --> 25:11.039
a link to a ninth phony profile

25:11.070 --> 25:12.833
on a totally different Web site.

25:12.870 --> 25:14.701
He was hunting a man
we didn't know about?

25:14.740 --> 25:16.207
Not a man. A woman.

25:18.780 --> 25:21.715
So this is profile number nine.
Raphael Arnold,

25:21.750 --> 25:23.718
aka Damien Novak.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.843
He whipped up Raphael
a couple months ago,

25:25.890 --> 25:28.188
made him a CPA
based out of Queens.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.586
You said he was using
this profile to hunt a woman?

25:30.630 --> 25:33.019
"Hunt" may be too strong a word,
but it definitely looks like

25:33.060 --> 25:34.721
he was targeting her.
He poked her

25:34.760 --> 25:36.022
a few times, tried to
start up a conversation,

25:36.060 --> 25:37.925
but she never took the bait.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.029
While men don't hold a monopoly
on sexual predation,

25:40.070 --> 25:42.732
Raphael is clearly of age,
so he wouldn't

25:42.770 --> 25:44.738
attract our kind of predator.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.909
The woman he reached out to
didn't look like a pervert,

25:46.940 --> 25:48.271
but you be the judge.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.771
Yvette Ingram.

25:52.810 --> 25:54.869
That's the woman who sued

25:54.920 --> 25:55.978
Jack McGill for
sexual harassment.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.681
I think
we've found a link

25:57.720 --> 25:58.709
between her and Damien Novak.
Don't you?

26:04.930 --> 26:07.797
So, you're saying that
this guy-- the one that was

26:07.830 --> 26:09.229
sending me all the messages--
he's really the one

26:09.260 --> 26:10.693
who beat up Jack?

26:10.730 --> 26:13.119
That's exactly
what we're saying.

26:13.170 --> 26:16.594
You were being pursued by
someone who, up until the moment

26:16.640 --> 26:18.198
he contacted you,
had only pursued

26:18.240 --> 26:21.209
the predators of teenage girls.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.128
Well, I don't, I don't
know what to tell you.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.670
I... I have a boyfriend.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.701
I've never preyed
on anybody.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.844
We think you preyed
on Damien Novak.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.689
What are you talking about?

26:31.720 --> 26:34.086
Somehow you knew he was
hunting sex predators.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.008
You lined Jack McGill up
in his crosshairs.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.153
(short chuckle)
This again.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.327
This again?

26:39.360 --> 26:41.328
Jack told that
little theory

26:41.360 --> 26:43.089
to anybody who
would listen

26:43.130 --> 26:44.666
when that video
came out.

26:44.700 --> 26:47.635
It was crazy then and
it's just as crazy now.

26:47.670 --> 26:50.036
We don't think Damien Novak
thought it was crazy.

26:50.070 --> 26:51.332
In fact, we think he saw

26:51.370 --> 26:52.769
everything Jack was saying
in the media

26:52.810 --> 26:55.370
and started to wonder,
had he been tricked?

26:55.410 --> 26:57.640
If he had, how did you
learn his secret?

26:57.680 --> 27:00.103
Was he in danger
of being exposed?

27:00.150 --> 27:01.242
He created _
the Raphael Arnold profile

27:01.280 --> 27:02.417
so he could look

27:02.450 --> 27:04.680
into you,
only you saw through it.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.188
You knew he was onto you, so you
ambushed him the other night.

27:07.220 --> 27:09.313
You're accusing me
of killing him.
The end result of your

27:09.360 --> 27:11.248
manipulation several months ago

27:11.290 --> 27:12.951
was a pretrial settlement

27:12.990 --> 27:14.321
of $10 million.

27:15.430 --> 27:18.365
Who had more reason to deceive
Mr. Novak than you?

27:21.740 --> 27:23.389
When exactly
was he killed?

27:23.440 --> 27:25.806
Two nights ago,
little after 8:00 pm.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.104
I was having dinner
with an ex-client

27:28.140 --> 27:29.676
on the Upper West Side.

27:29.710 --> 27:31.701
I'm trying to start
my own agency. She can

27:31.750 --> 27:33.274
vouch for that.
As for your motive,

27:33.310 --> 27:34.846
you couldn't be more wrong.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.973
I didn't get $10 million.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.681
I got a fraction
of $10 million.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.779
Actually, a fraction
of a fraction.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.856
The bulk of that settlement
went to the investment firm

27:42.890 --> 27:44.721
that actually paid
for that lawsuit.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.682
Investment firm?

27:46.730 --> 27:49.392
You are familiar with litigation
financing, aren't you?

27:49.430 --> 27:51.421
Wealthy investors furnish
the capital needed to bring

27:51.470 --> 27:55.167
civil suits in exchange for
a sizable cut of the proceeds.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.361
It was never about the money.

27:57.400 --> 28:01.029
Jack made my life hell
while I was working with him.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.709
The way he looked at me,
the-the things he would say.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.069
I wanted to make sure
that he could never

28:06.110 --> 28:07.441
do that to anyone again.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.368
I was going up
against a company,

28:09.420 --> 28:12.139
they had deep pockets,
I needed help.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.055
If you think that
he was really set up

28:14.090 --> 28:15.455
by somebody who could profit

28:15.490 --> 28:17.788
from that lawsuit,

28:17.830 --> 28:20.185
you should talk to the people
that actually paid for it.

28:23.430 --> 28:25.227
Hello?

28:25.270 --> 28:27.329
Come in.
(chuckles softly)

28:27.370 --> 28:30.430
Tell me
you don't smell that.

28:30.470 --> 28:31.937
Smell what?
The gas.

28:31.970 --> 28:34.438
Pilot went out. Then I
found a corroded pipe.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.833
Had to change it out.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.007
Oh, no.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.847
The air smells fine.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.472
Mm. It's funny,

28:41.520 --> 28:43.784
I'm supposed to be helping with
repairs around the building,

28:43.820 --> 28:45.412
but so far,

28:45.450 --> 28:48.817
most of the broken-down
stuff is in here.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.179
I got your text.

28:50.220 --> 28:51.858
You said you want to
talk about something?

28:51.890 --> 28:55.098
Uh, yeah. Ajob.

28:55.130 --> 28:58.019
I told you that I was gonna
take a break from interviewing.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.790
Well, you would not need
to interview for this job.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.364
It would be with me.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.005
I thought I could teach you
to do what I do.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.905
(chuckles)

29:07.940 --> 29:10.033
You want to teach me...

29:10.080 --> 29:12.503
to be a private eye?
I think you'd be

29:12.550 --> 29:14.848
great at it-- you're smart,
you know how to read people.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.518
You were a great help
when we were looking for

29:16.550 --> 29:17.778
the Bensonhurst Bomber.
We would not have

29:17.820 --> 29:19.048
been able to find him
without you.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.182
I was a help

29:20.220 --> 29:21.357
because I'm an ex-con.

29:21.390 --> 29:22.459
That don't mean I'm good

29:22.490 --> 29:23.787
at detecting stuff.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.286
I knew a guy
who knew a guy.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.218
You would be surprised how
important those connections are

29:27.260 --> 29:28.352
in our line of work.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.527
It took me years
to find my own.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.028
(scoffs)
You should try going to prison

29:33.070 --> 29:34.890
for a while.
Listen, Sherlock and I

29:34.940 --> 29:37.295
have experience with teaching.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.365
You'd be paid a stipend,
which is more than you make at

29:39.410 --> 29:41.833
the gym. But the work is hard.
You'd have to be available 24/7.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.802
And you'd have to study harder

29:43.850 --> 29:45.977
than you've ever studied
in your life.

29:46.010 --> 29:48.410
But in the end,
I think it would be worth it.

29:48.450 --> 29:50.418
You'd be your own boss.

29:50.450 --> 29:53.317
And it's work that your daughter
could be proud of.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.010
No.

29:57.890 --> 29:59.255
No.

29:59.290 --> 30:01.827
Look, I appreciate
all that you're doing.

30:01.860 --> 30:02.895
You know I do.

30:02.930 --> 30:04.568
But that doesn't mean

30:04.600 --> 30:05.862
I'm always gonna agree with you.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.492
I don't expect you to.

30:07.530 --> 30:10.260
I know, it just feels
that way sometimes.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.905
Thank you for the offer.

30:15.910 --> 30:17.798
Of course.

30:19.210 --> 30:21.212
All right, listen,
you have a good night, okay?

30:25.490 --> 30:27.981
(door opens)

30:28.020 --> 30:30.580
(door closes)

30:30.620 --> 30:32.281
What are you doing?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.423
I'm just typing.

30:34.460 --> 30:36.451
I mean with the glasses.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.468
Oh, I-I forgot I had those on.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.469
They're, uh, they're just
helping me get into character.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.468
(computer beeps)

30:43.500 --> 30:45.434
Oh, my God, you have your own

30:45.470 --> 30:46.630
TrueRomantix
account?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.308
No, Wade Applewhite
has his own

30:48.340 --> 30:49.534
TrueRomantix account.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.343
He's one of my aliases.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.200
Florida-born,
moved to the city in '07,

30:53.250 --> 30:56.139
systems analyst with big dreams,
enjoys wind surfing.

30:56.180 --> 30:58.648
I thought I would take a page
out of Damien Novak's book

30:58.690 --> 31:00.317
and try a little
catfishing of my own.

31:00.350 --> 31:02.159
What do you mean?

31:02.190 --> 31:04.658
I've been romancing a secretary
who works at the investment firm

31:04.690 --> 31:06.920
which backed
Yvette Ingram's lawsuit.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.222
We've been chatting
for almost an hour.

31:08.260 --> 31:09.921
I think
she's a hair's breadth

31:09.960 --> 31:11.291
from sending me
a list of the

31:11.330 --> 31:12.627
individuals who profited.

31:12.670 --> 31:15.298
Wow, that's pretty low.

31:15.340 --> 31:16.898
Well, it is and it isn't.

31:16.940 --> 31:18.100
I mean, I chose her

31:18.140 --> 31:20.608
based on certain beliefs
she's espoused

31:20.640 --> 31:21.937
on social media.
For example,

31:21.980 --> 31:23.277
she started her own chapter

31:23.310 --> 31:25.073
of the Ayn Rand
Appreciation Society

31:25.110 --> 31:27.408
because the New York chapter
was too charitable,

31:27.450 --> 31:29.645
so, you know, when Wade
fails to meet her

31:29.680 --> 31:31.238
for line dancing tomorrow night,

31:31.290 --> 31:32.917
I'm not going to
lose much sleep.

31:32.950 --> 31:34.679
Oh, I spoke to Shinwell tonight.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.551
And?

31:36.590 --> 31:40.048
You're right...
Not a detective.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.398
Not for everyone, Watson.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.159
In fact...
(computer pings)

31:43.200 --> 31:46.067
Oh. The biscuit
is in the basket.

31:46.100 --> 31:49.934
Sorry. That's just something
that Wade would say.

31:49.970 --> 31:52.632
His would-be girlfriend
has sent a list of investors.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.434
Tell me you don't have to
catfish any of them tonight.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.244
I don't think any additional
subterfuge will be necessary.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.702
One of_these names
is qUIte familiar.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.479
You met him the other day.

32:03.350 --> 32:05.045
You should know,
I've advised my client

32:05.090 --> 32:06.409
not to answer any questions.

32:06.450 --> 32:09.988
BELL: That's okay,
he can just listen.

32:10.020 --> 32:12.056
We know you lied to us
the other day, Mr. Lerner.

32:12.090 --> 32:14.354
When we said there was evidence
that suggested

32:14.400 --> 32:16.493
your brother-in-law
was a sex predator,

32:16.530 --> 32:18.725
you couldn't get on
board fast enough.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.567
But the truth is
he was hunting men like that.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.033
And you knew it.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.530
You said you
talked to Damien

32:24.570 --> 32:27.539
after your sister thought
he was having an affair.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.538
We're guessing he told you the
truth about what he was doing.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.502
HOLMES:
The timing was
quite fortuitous.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.075
You'd invested rather heavily
in a sexual harassment suit

32:34.120 --> 32:36.179
being brought by a woman
named Yvette Ingram.

32:36.220 --> 32:39.087
And those depositions were
not going as you'd hoped.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.759
So you created a phony
TrueRomantix profile

32:41.790 --> 32:44.122
for Yvette's former boss,
Jack McGill,

32:44.160 --> 32:47.425
and struck up a conversation
with one of Damien's alter egos.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.451
Not long after,
Damien assaulted McGill,

32:49.500 --> 32:52.196
and posted a video
that branded him a sex predator.

32:52.230 --> 32:53.720
A big cash
settlement for Yvette

32:53.770 --> 32:56.694
went from being a long
shot to a sure thing.

32:56.740 --> 32:59.129
You made your money
back times ten.

32:59.170 --> 33:02.537
Damien was a loose end, however,

33:02.580 --> 33:04.172
so you tied him up.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.468
GARRETT:
Wait. What do y--
what do you mean?

33:07.510 --> 33:09.216
Garrett.
No, no, uh...

33:09.250 --> 33:11.616
Are-are you saying
I killed him?

33:11.650 --> 33:13.015
The other day,
you let your sister think

33:13.050 --> 33:14.779
that her freshly-murdered
husband

33:14.820 --> 33:17.550
was a habitual_ seducer of
teenagers, so it's not hard

33:17.590 --> 33:20.753
for us to see you
make the leap to murder.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.792
Have you said anything
to Stephanie about this?

33:22.830 --> 33:24.127
Garrett,
I thought we agreed...
No, no, no, no.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.092
They thinkI killed Damien.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.132
Do you know what that
would do to my sister?

33:28.170 --> 33:30.092
We haven't talked to Stephanie.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.199
Yet.
Okay, yes.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.764
I tricked Damien
into going after McGill,

33:33.810 --> 33:36.233
but I did not kill him.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.100
Mr. Lerner, after everything
that's happened,

33:38.150 --> 33:39.503
why should we believe a word
you say?

33:39.550 --> 33:42.246
Because... I needed him alive.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.816
Explain that to us.

33:43.850 --> 33:45.784
When I communicated
with him as Jack McGill,

33:45.820 --> 33:47.811
I did it from a library
near my house.

33:47.850 --> 33:49.715
If he ever caught on to me,
I didn't want him to trace it

33:49.760 --> 33:51.352
back to my home computer.

33:51.390 --> 33:54.052
The night that he was killed,
I was at the library again.

33:54.100 --> 33:57.251
I had invested in another
sexual harassment case.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.666
I figured I could
use Damien again

33:59.700 --> 34:03.090
to get it to go the way
I wanted.

34:03.140 --> 34:05.062
I was creating
a phony profile, okay,

34:05.110 --> 34:06.634
in the name
of the new defendant,

34:06.670 --> 34:08.501
to get Damien to go after him.

34:08.540 --> 34:10.076
There's cameras
at the library.

34:10.110 --> 34:13.102
Go see.
I'm-I'm telling the truth.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.412
Am I a despicable person? Yes.

34:14.450 --> 34:15.769
Did I trick Damien?

34:15.820 --> 34:17.344
Yes.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.143
But I'm telling you,

34:19.190 --> 34:20.418
I never would have hurt him.

34:20.450 --> 34:21.451
Never. Not for all the money
in the world.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.297
WATSON:
How'd it go at the library?

34:33.330 --> 34:35.230
Yes, well, it turns out I took
out their copy

34:35.270 --> 34:38.467
of the Codex Seraphinianus
in 2011 and never returned it.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.398
And they refused access
to their security footage

34:40.440 --> 34:41.475
until I settled up.

34:41.510 --> 34:44.149
$463 later,
Marcus and I were able

34:46.610 --> 34:48.646
He did not kill
his brother-in-law.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.318
WATSON:
I had a feeling
it was going that way,

34:50.350 --> 34:53.285
so I dug back into the men
that Damien Novak shamed.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.457
And?

34:54.490 --> 34:55.650
Well, you and I both

34:55.690 --> 34:56.714
don't like Jack McGill
for the murder,

34:56.760 --> 34:58.557
so I put him to the side.

34:58.590 --> 34:59.659
Jerome Chun is
still in a coma,

34:59.690 --> 35:01.123
and Reuben Welker

35:01.160 --> 35:02.559
is still in prison.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.192
So that just leaves
Ignacio Gomez

35:04.230 --> 35:06.425
and Shane Fitzhugh.

35:06.470 --> 35:08.267
Both of whom
fled the country.
Yeah.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.336
That why you were crying,
Watson?

35:10.370 --> 35:12.531
Excuse me?

35:12.570 --> 35:15.607
You've been crying sometime
in the last hour.

35:15.640 --> 35:19.508
Okay, first of all,
I did not cry,

35:19.550 --> 35:20.801
I teared up,
and second of all,

35:20.850 --> 35:22.272
it wasn't because
we weren't able

35:22.320 --> 35:23.514
to pin one of these guys
to the murder.

35:23.550 --> 35:25.381
It was because of these.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.754
Oh, these are
the statements

35:31.790 --> 35:33.587
from the women hurt
by Fitzhugh and Gomez.

35:33.630 --> 35:36.622
Oh, the toughest one to read

35:36.660 --> 35:40.460
was one of Fitzhugh's victims,
Nadia Swain.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.536
He was her J.V.
field hockey coach.

35:42.570 --> 35:43.889
Over the course
of a year,

35:43.940 --> 35:45.259
he abused her over
a hundred times.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.538
She was 14.

35:46.570 --> 35:48.709
20 when she wrote this.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.435
Yeah, it took her that long
to come forward.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.549
When she was a kid,
he convinced her

35:51.580 --> 35:53.400
that no one was gonna
believe her

35:53.450 --> 35:54.940
and it was all her fault.
When she went to college,

35:54.980 --> 35:56.948
she knew better.
Hmm.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.540
Told you it was
tough to read.

35:59.590 --> 36:02.457
Ms. Swain writes that for years
she's required

36:02.490 --> 36:04.219
a daily cocktail
of anti-depressants

36:04.260 --> 36:05.818
and anti-anxiety medication.

36:05.860 --> 36:08.397
Who knows how long she's gonna
have to take those for?

36:08.430 --> 36:09.829
(sighs)

36:09.860 --> 36:11.623
Is there a problem?

36:11.670 --> 36:13.399
Well, the problem is,

36:13.430 --> 36:16.558
I don't just know
who killed Damien Novak, Watson.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.862
ButI liked her.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.244
Miss Parsons,
please have a seat.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.841
If you need more data from
TrueRomantix, I can't help you.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.519
I gave my notice
two days ago.

36:32.550 --> 36:33.619
No, that's not why
we asked you here.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.618
So the other day,
I, uh, misunderstood

36:35.660 --> 36:37.810
why you were interested in my
conversation with your boss.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.487
I thought you
were eavesdropping

36:39.530 --> 36:41.498
because you didn't
like him, but in truth,

36:41.530 --> 36:42.849
you wanted to know how
much the police knew

36:42.900 --> 36:44.788
about Damien
Novak's murder.

36:44.830 --> 36:47.958
I'm sorry. Um...
Damien Novak?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.434
The man you shot
the other night.

36:50.470 --> 36:52.859
We know your real name
is Nadia Swain.

36:52.910 --> 36:57.006
We also know that in 2009
you were Victimized

36:57.040 --> 36:59.349
by a man named Shane Fitzhugh.

36:59.380 --> 37:00.642
Last year, you
worked up the courage

37:00.680 --> 37:02.841
to tell the New Jersey
Police about it.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.587
HOLMES:
You gave them a very
detailed statement, and in that

37:05.620 --> 37:08.259
you explained how you needed a,
uh, certain regimen

37:08.290 --> 37:09.655
of medications now.

37:09.690 --> 37:11.578
Sertraline, 150
milligrams, once a day.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.621
Aripiprazole, five
milligrams, twice a day.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.457
Clonazepam, one-half milligram,
once a day.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.899
Now, when I approached
your desk the other day,

37:16.930 --> 37:18.818
I saw that very same
combination

37:18.870 --> 37:20.758
_ of medications
in your pill organizer.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.291
You own a white Toyota Camry,
right?

37:24.840 --> 37:26.000
So?

37:26.040 --> 37:27.439
We have video of a white Camry

37:27.470 --> 37:28.676
tearing out of the parking lot

37:28.710 --> 37:31.270
where Damien Novak was shot.
A lot of people

37:31.310 --> 37:32.607
own white Camrys.
How many of them

37:32.650 --> 37:34.311
also own a nine millimeter
handgun?

37:34.350 --> 37:37.444
We know you registered one
after you turned 21.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.789
It's the same caliber gun
used to kill Damien Novak.

37:39.820 --> 37:42.948
At first we... we didn't get it.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.787
Why kill Novak?

37:44.830 --> 37:46.752
I mean, he shamed
sex predators,

37:46.790 --> 37:48.951
including the one that hurt you.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.629
But then we reached out
to Jersey City PD.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.763
All of a sudden,
everything made sense.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.688
After you came forward,
they started an investigation

37:56.740 --> 37:58.537
into Mr. Fitzhugh.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.561
They took what you said
very seriously.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.305
But after so much
time had passed,

38:02.340 --> 38:04.035
there wasn't any evidence.
BELL: It took them a few months,

38:04.080 --> 38:06.947
but they managed to identify
a second girl he'd hurt...

38:06.980 --> 38:09.073
then a third.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.715
HOLMES: So they were on the
verge of making an arrest,

38:12.750 --> 38:15.719
and then _Mr. Novak mu_scles
his way into the equation.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.716
He shames your tormentor.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.729
He does such a good job, the man
has to leave the country.

38:20.760 --> 38:24.719
So, all of a sudden,
your quest for justice... over.

38:24.770 --> 38:27.864
You got angry,
you wanted revenge,

38:27.900 --> 38:30.767
but the man who cost you a shot
at Fitzhugh was anonymous.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.802
All anyone knew about him

38:32.840 --> 38:35.832
was that he set traps
at TrueRomantix.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.074
HOLMES:
So you dropped out of college.

38:37.110 --> 38:38.600
You got a job there,
undercover, right?

38:38.650 --> 38:40.777
You got access to their files,

38:40.810 --> 38:41.947
and then all of a sudden,
this hunter,

38:41.980 --> 38:43.868
he becomes the hunted.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.582
BELL:
It took you some time,
but you managed to identify

38:46.620 --> 38:48.679
Novak's newest phony accounts.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.483
You monitored them,

38:50.520 --> 38:52.784
and when you saw he was going
to meet Winston Utz

38:52.830 --> 38:54.798
at a motel a few nights ago,

38:54.830 --> 38:56.957
you acted.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.868
I wanted him to understand
what he'd done.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.765
I wanted to shame him.

39:05.570 --> 39:07.435
I was gonna make a video
of my own.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.802
Him on his knees
apologizing.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.843
He was on his way to that man's
room when I came up behind him

39:12.880 --> 39:14.609
and put the gun to his back.

39:14.650 --> 39:15.912
(crying)

39:15.950 --> 39:17.577
Made him tie his own hands.

39:17.620 --> 39:19.679
But then, when he
turned around,

39:19.720 --> 39:22.609
when he saw me...

39:24.660 --> 39:27.959
...he wasn't afraid anymore.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.799
He said

39:29.830 --> 39:34.665
he was sorry that I was upset...

39:36.800 --> 39:38.461
...but he wasn't gonna stop.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.865
It's like when
he looked at me,

39:40.910 --> 39:44.368
he saw what Shane saw.

39:47.850 --> 39:50.444
A victim.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.558
(crying)

39:54.590 --> 39:58.526
I didn't mean to kill him.

40:00.490 --> 40:02.128
(footsteps)

40:02.160 --> 40:03.752
WATSON:
What are you doing?

40:03.800 --> 40:07.520
I'm chatting with a policeman
in the province of Bali.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.595
Well, you don't have
your glasses on,

40:09.640 --> 40:12.803
so I'm guessing you're not
Wade Applewhite right now.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.603
I am not.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.801
Bali.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.071
Isn't that where Shane Fitzhugh
fled to?

40:20.110 --> 40:25.116
Indonesia has no extradition
treaty with the United States.

40:25.150 --> 40:26.686
In my early days as a detective,

40:26.720 --> 40:29.609
I lost many suspects
to such countries.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.924
Didn't sit well, so I began
to develop friendships

40:31.960 --> 40:35.020
with those countries' various
branches of law enforcement.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.948
Okay.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.763
Shane Fitzhugh's
going to be arrested

40:38.800 --> 40:41.769
by the Balinese police
tomorrow morning.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.688
Did he hurt someone there?

40:43.740 --> 40:48.200
Gonna find ten kilograms
of uncut cocaine in his home.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.606
Your friend is gonna plant it.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.869
Drug laws in that part
of the world... quite severe.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.478
He'll be spending
the rest of his life

40:57.520 --> 40:58.987
in an Indonesian prison.

40:59.020 --> 41:00.544
I typically don't like
such measures,

41:00.590 --> 41:03.514
but there's ample evidence
that Fitzhugh's a threat

41:03.560 --> 41:05.755
to young women wherever
he resides.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.159
If you feel I'm acting rashly...

41:12.630 --> 41:14.063
I didn't say anything.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.505
(indistinct voices in distance)

41:31.820 --> 41:33.242
Bang!

41:35.160 --> 41:37.515
You couldn't find a better
hiding place for this thing?

41:38.960 --> 41:42.589
Hey, if I can find it,
so can your parole officer.

41:42.630 --> 41:45.064
Why are you here?

41:45.100 --> 41:46.522
Heard about your new friend,
Ms. Watson.

41:46.570 --> 41:47.764
I understand you two
been spending

41:47.800 --> 41:49.062
a lot of time together.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.660
What do you care?

41:51.710 --> 41:54.065
(laughing)
You are aware that she works
for the police, aren't you?

41:54.110 --> 41:57.170
You and me, Shinwell,

41:57.210 --> 42:00.646
we got big plans.

42:00.680 --> 42:04.741
Be a shame if you die
before we see them through.

42:05.750 --> 42:08.685
(door opens)

42:08.720 --> 42:09.709
(door closes)
