00:19.709 --> 00:21.573
MALCOLM X,
WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:21.607 --> 00:22.781
OF CASSIUS' VICTORY
IN MIAMI?

00:22.815 --> 00:24.127
I THINK IT WAS
A GREAT VICTORY.

00:24.162 --> 00:25.404
HE PROVED HE WAS
THE BEST MAN.

00:25.439 --> 00:27.475
AND DO YOU THINK
THAT CASSIUS' BEING

00:27.510 --> 00:30.099
A BLACK MUSLIM HAS
HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THIS VICTORY?

00:30.133 --> 00:32.549
WELL, I HAVEN'T
HEARD HIM SAY HE WAS
A BLACK MUSLIM.

00:32.584 --> 00:35.069
HE'S A CLEAN-LIVING
YOUNG MAN,

00:35.104 --> 00:37.761
AND THIS IS THE MAIN THING
THAT THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

00:37.796 --> 00:40.868
DOES TEACH IN SPREADING
THE RELIGION OF ISLAM
THROUGHOUT THE--

00:40.902 --> 00:42.628
AMONG OUR PEOPLE
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:42.663 --> 00:46.425
MR. X, HOW LONG
HAS CASSIUS BEEN
A BLACK MUSLIM?

00:46.460 --> 00:48.151
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

00:48.186 --> 00:50.222
UH, WELL I DON'T KNOW.
CASSIUS IS PROBABLY--

00:50.257 --> 00:52.190
PROBABLY MORE CAPABLE
OF SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF

00:52.224 --> 00:54.399
THAN ANY OTHER MAN
IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:01.613 --> 01:05.375
ON THE MORNING
OF FEBRUARY 26, 1964,

01:05.410 --> 01:06.859
CASSIUS CLAY RETURNED TO

01:06.894 --> 01:08.723
THE MIAMI BEACH
CONVENTION CENTER,

01:08.758 --> 01:11.692
WHERE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
HE HAD BEATEN SONNY LISTON

01:11.726 --> 01:14.488
TO CLAIM THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE.

01:14.522 --> 01:17.663
HE WAS JUST 22 YEARS OLD.

01:17.698 --> 01:21.529
CLAY GAVE A VERY
GENTLEMANLY INTERVIEW.

01:21.564 --> 01:24.187
"I DON'T HAVE TO BE
WILD AND CRAZY ANYMORE.

01:24.222 --> 01:27.121
I CAN BE A NICE GENTLEMAN,"

01:27.156 --> 01:33.196
AND ALL THE OLDER REPORTERS
LEFT VERY SATISFIED.

01:33.231 --> 01:37.511
THE YOUNGER REPORTERS,
WE STAYED TALKING TO HIM.

01:37.545 --> 01:41.273
"WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOU
AND THE BLACK MUSLIMS?"

01:41.308 --> 01:46.140
AND SUDDENLY HE SAID,
"RED BIRDS STAY WITH RED BIRDS,

01:46.175 --> 01:48.832
"AND BLUE BIRDS
WITH BLUE BIRDS.

01:48.867 --> 01:51.663
"YOU STAY WITH PEOPLE
OF YOUR OWN KIND.

01:51.697 --> 01:54.873
THAT'S NATURE."

01:54.907 --> 01:58.428
I DON'T HAVE TO BE
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO BE.

01:58.463 --> 01:59.912
I'M FREE TO BE WHAT I WANT
TO BE AND THINK

01:59.947 --> 02:01.880
WHAT I WANT TO THINK,
ALL RIGHT?

02:01.914 --> 02:04.883
AND THAT REALLY SOUNDED
LIKE AN ATHLETIC DECLARATION

02:04.917 --> 02:08.162
OF INDEPENDENCE, SOMETHING THAT
WE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE

02:08.197 --> 02:10.199
IN ANY SPORT,

02:10.233 --> 02:13.271
AND IT WAS A REALLY
A VERY POWERFUL MOMENT,

02:13.305 --> 02:14.755
AND THEN HE WENT ON.

02:14.789 --> 02:16.515
I WASN'T FORCING
MYSELF IN NO NEIGHBORHOODS

02:16.550 --> 02:18.448
I'M NOT WANTED.

02:18.483 --> 02:20.726
I WASN'T BUSTING DOWN
NO SCHOOLS AND SHAMING AMERICA.

02:20.761 --> 02:22.418
I WASN'T DOING NOTHING.

02:22.452 --> 02:24.247
I WAS JUST
AROUND COLORED PEOPLE,

02:24.282 --> 02:26.594
AND NOW I'M CATCHING MORE HELL
THAN ALL THE PEOPLE

02:26.629 --> 02:28.458
WHO'S RAISING HELL.

02:28.493 --> 02:31.668
I LIKE EVERYBODY,
BUT ONE NEGRO COMING TO SCHOOL

02:31.703 --> 02:33.705
AND THE POLICE FORCE
IS OUT THERE AND THE MAYOR

02:33.739 --> 02:35.776
AND THE GOVERNOR
AND THE FIREMEN WITH THE HOSES

02:35.810 --> 02:38.227
AND RACE RIOTS
AND WHOOPING THEM.

02:38.261 --> 02:39.745
DO YOU
THINK IT'S AWFUL?

02:39.780 --> 02:41.713
YES, AWFUL.
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT AROUND IT.

02:41.747 --> 02:45.199
I MIGHT GET KILLED.

02:45.234 --> 02:47.891
THE NEXT DAY,
HE TOLD A REPORTER,

02:47.926 --> 02:49.790
"MY RELIGION IS ISLAM.

02:49.824 --> 02:52.517
"I BELIEVE ALLAH IS GOD.

02:52.551 --> 02:55.416
"I THINK THIS IS THE TRUE WAY
TO SAVE THE WORLD,

02:55.451 --> 02:58.454
WHICH IS ON FIRE WITH HATE."

02:58.488 --> 03:01.008
HE'S 22 YEARS OLD,

03:01.042 --> 03:04.494
AND HE'S STANDING UP
TO THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT.

03:04.529 --> 03:06.013
"I AM THE WORLD CHAMPION.

03:06.047 --> 03:07.980
"I HAVE CHANGED MY RELIGION,

03:08.015 --> 03:12.295
AND YOU'RE SIMPLY GOING
TO HAVE TO ACCEPT IT."

03:12.330 --> 03:14.987
HIS JOINING
A FAITH COMMUNITY,

03:15.022 --> 03:17.473
WHICH IS IN ESSENCE WHAT HE DID,

03:17.507 --> 03:19.302
IT WASN'T ACCEPTED.

03:19.337 --> 03:21.511
IT WAS SEEN MORE AS SOMETHING
POLITICAL

03:21.546 --> 03:23.789
BECAUSE
OF THE RACIAL ASPECT OF IT.

03:23.824 --> 03:26.930
IT WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO
MANY, MANY, WHITE PEOPLE,

03:26.965 --> 03:28.622
OF THE TIME.

03:28.656 --> 03:31.452
HE WAS VILIFIED,
AND IT WAS THOUGHT

03:31.487 --> 03:35.249
THAT IT WAS, UM--
HE WAS UN-AMERICAN.

03:35.284 --> 03:36.492
THAT WAS THE BIG THING.

03:36.526 --> 03:37.941
HE WAS UN-AMERICAN.

03:47.917 --> 03:49.470
DEMONSTRATIONS OF ALL TYPES

03:49.505 --> 03:50.851
ARE PROHIBITED.

03:50.885 --> 03:53.785
CURFEW AT 9 PM.

03:53.819 --> 03:55.338
GUARDSMEN USED
TEARGAS TO BREAK UP

03:55.373 --> 03:57.444
ANOTHER NEGRO PROTEST.

04:02.897 --> 04:05.003
IN THE 4 YEARS
IT HAD TAKEN CASSIUS CLAY

04:05.037 --> 04:07.695
TO RISE FROM LITTLE-KNOWN
OLYMPIC HOPEFUL

04:07.730 --> 04:10.905
TO HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD, AFRICAN-AMERICANS

04:10.940 --> 04:15.427
HAD WAGED A NON-VIOLENT
CAMPAIGN FOR INTEGRATION,

04:15.462 --> 04:17.981
ORGANIZING FREEDOM RIDES,

04:18.016 --> 04:21.675
CHALLENGING THE UNLAWFUL
SEGREGATION OF SCHOOLS,

04:21.709 --> 04:24.091
AND STAGING A MASSIVE
DEMONSTRATION

04:24.125 --> 04:27.750
ON THE MALL IN WASHINGTON D.C.

04:27.784 --> 04:32.651
THERE WILL BE NEITHER REST
NOR TRANQUILITY IN AMERICA

04:32.686 --> 04:36.552
UNTIL THE NEGRO IS GRANTED
HIS CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS.

04:46.113 --> 04:48.529
THEY WERE MET
BY A WHITE AMERICA

04:48.564 --> 04:52.361
VIOLENTLY DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN
THE RACIAL STATUS QUO.

04:52.395 --> 04:55.985
2-4-6-8,
WE DON'T WANT TO INTEGRATE.

04:56.019 --> 04:58.021
THE WINNER
BY A TKO

04:58.056 --> 05:02.025
IN THE SEVENTH ROUND
CASSIUS CLAY!

05:02.060 --> 05:03.993
CLAY THRILLED
THOSE WHO IDENTIFIED

05:04.027 --> 05:06.858
WITH HIS STRONG SENSE
OF RACIAL PRIDE,

05:06.892 --> 05:08.860
BUT MANY OTHERS
WERE ANGERED BY WHAT

05:08.894 --> 05:11.759
THEY REGARDED AS HIS LACK
OF HUMILITY,

05:11.794 --> 05:15.522
HIS REFUSAL TO ABIDE
BY THE OLD SOCIAL ORDER,

05:15.556 --> 05:18.041
AND HIS ASSOCIATION
WITH THE NATION OF ISLAM,

05:18.076 --> 05:21.528
WHICH PREACHED
THE SEPARATION OF THE RACES.

05:21.562 --> 05:26.049
TO THEM, CASSIUS CLAY WAS
UNGRATEFUL AND OFFENSIVE

05:26.084 --> 05:29.087
AND A THREAT THAT
NEEDED TO BE STOPPED.

05:33.125 --> 05:38.752
I WAS AS A CHILD
AFRAID OF CASSIUS CLAY

05:38.786 --> 05:44.378
BECAUSE HE CALLED UP
VIOLENT EMOTIONS

05:44.413 --> 05:47.519
IN BLACK MEN SPECIFICALLY
IN THE COMMUNITY.

05:47.554 --> 05:49.866
I LIVED IN WATTS AT THE TIME,

05:49.901 --> 05:58.875
AND WHAT I SAW IN HIM WAS
SOMETHING THAT

05:58.910 --> 06:03.604
COULD CAUSE ANYTHING TO HAPPEN,

06:03.639 --> 06:05.157
AND IT WAS TRUE
OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.

06:05.192 --> 06:07.746
CERTAINLY EVERYBODY
WAS AFRAID OF MALCOLM X

06:07.781 --> 06:09.852
BECAUSE HE SAID, "THEY'RE
STEALING FROM US.

06:09.886 --> 06:11.509
"THEY ROBBING FROM US.
THEY HATE US.

06:11.543 --> 06:13.027
THEY KILL US."

06:13.062 --> 06:14.201
WE ALL KNEW IT,
BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED

06:14.235 --> 06:16.583
TO BE SAYING THAT,

06:16.617 --> 06:19.620
AND YOU COULD SEE IT
RESONATING IN PEOPLE,

06:19.655 --> 06:22.071
THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING
IN THAT 500 YEARS

06:22.105 --> 06:24.970
OF OPPRESSION.

06:25.005 --> 06:28.905
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS A SPARK,
AND I WAS STANDING

06:28.940 --> 06:32.840
IN A FIELD OF GASOLINE
AND THINKING, "OH, NO."

06:32.875 --> 06:35.947
I DON'T--I'M GONNA
BE IN TROUBLE.

06:42.125 --> 06:46.475
ON FEBRUARY 26, 1964,
AT AN ANNUAL ASSEMBLY

06:46.509 --> 06:49.788
IN CHICAGO, THE NATION
OF ISLAM'S HEAD MINISTER

06:49.823 --> 06:52.170
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD PRAISED
CASSIUS CLAY

06:52.204 --> 06:55.035
FOR DEFEATING SONNY LISTON.

06:55.069 --> 06:59.833
HE WAS
ABLE BY CONFESSING

06:59.867 --> 07:03.112
ALLAH IS GOD
AND MUHAMMAD IS HIS MESSENGER.

07:04.872 --> 07:08.876
THAT HE WHIPPED
A MUCH TOUGHER MAN THAN HE.

07:20.578 --> 07:24.478
THE ENEMY WANTED HIM
TO COME OUT ALL BLASTED.

07:24.513 --> 07:26.929
YES, SIR!
YES, SIR!

07:26.963 --> 07:29.863
THEY HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD--
HEH HEH--

07:29.897 --> 07:33.694
LISTON WOULD TEAR UP
THAT PRETTY FACE OF YOURS...

07:36.214 --> 07:39.010
BUT ALLAH AND MYSELF
SAID NO, NO.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.188
THOUGH
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD HAD ALWAYS

07:45.223 --> 07:48.916
CONDEMNED SPORTS
AS FRIVOLOUS ENTERTAINMENT,

07:48.951 --> 07:51.229
HE NOW ORDERED THE EDITOR
OF THE NATION OF ISLAM'S

07:51.263 --> 07:55.647
NEWSPAPER "MUHAMMAD SPEAKS"
TO ADD 4 ADDITIONAL PAGES

07:55.682 --> 07:58.167
DEDICATED TO THE NEW CHAMPION.

07:58.201 --> 08:00.859
"MUHAMMAD SPEAKS."
WHAT'S UP, MY BROTHER?

08:00.894 --> 08:02.896
SUDDENLY ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
HAS TO THINK ABOUT THIS GUY

08:02.930 --> 08:04.242
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY

08:04.276 --> 08:06.278
BECAUSE HAD HE LOST
TO SONNY LISTON,

08:06.313 --> 08:08.695
AS EVERYONE EXPECTED,
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD COULD'VE

08:08.729 --> 08:10.524
BRUSHED HIM UNDER THE RUG,

08:10.559 --> 08:12.043
BUT NOW HE'S THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD,

08:12.077 --> 08:13.700
AND SUDDENLY ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
REALIZES THAT

08:13.734 --> 08:15.080
THIS COULD BE AN ASSET.

08:15.115 --> 08:17.876
THIS COULD HELP HIM
WITH RECRUITING,

08:17.911 --> 08:22.225
THAT MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T BE
SO FAST TO DISMISS THIS KID.

08:22.260 --> 08:24.607
ON MARCH 1,
CASSIUS CLAY DROVE

08:24.642 --> 08:26.644
TO NEW YORK, WHERE HE CHECKED
INTO THE HOTEL THERESA

08:26.678 --> 08:30.268
IN HARLEM,
AND REUNITED WITH MALCOLM X,

08:30.302 --> 08:33.547
THE MUSLIM MINISTER WHO HAD
BECOME HIS SPIRITUAL ADVISOR

08:33.582 --> 08:35.307
AND CLOSE FRIEND.

08:35.342 --> 08:37.724
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
HAD SUSPENDED MALCOLM

08:37.758 --> 08:40.036
FROM THE NATION OF ISLAM,
AND WITH LITTLE CHANCE

08:40.071 --> 08:43.799
OF BEING REINSTATED, HE HAD
QUIETLY BEGUN MAKING PLANS

08:43.833 --> 08:47.112
TO FORM HIS OWN MOVEMENT,
ONE THAT HE HOPED

08:47.147 --> 08:50.875
WOULD INCLUDE CASSIUS CLAY.

08:50.909 --> 08:54.292
THAT EVENING, THE TWO MEN
JOINED A CROWD OF 500 PEOPLE

08:54.326 --> 08:56.777
AT THE TRANS-LUX THEATRE
IN MIDTOWN

08:56.812 --> 09:00.022
FOR A SCREENING
OF CLAY'S FIGHT WITH LISTON.

09:00.056 --> 09:02.783
IN THE MORNING, MALCOLM
TOOK CASSIUS TO THE OFFICES

09:02.818 --> 09:06.649
OF THE "AMSTERDAM NEWS,"
WHERE THE BOXER TOLD REPORTERS

09:06.684 --> 09:08.893
THAT HE HAD
RENOUNCED THE NAME CLAY,

09:08.927 --> 09:12.690
WHICH THE NATION OF ISLAM
CONSIDERED A "SLAVE NAME,"

09:12.724 --> 09:16.141
AND WOULD NOW GO BY CASSIUS X.

09:16.176 --> 09:18.799
HERE'S MY BUDDY.

09:18.834 --> 09:22.251
ON MARCH 5, THEY
VISITED THE UNITED NATIONS.

09:22.285 --> 09:24.978
"I'M CHAMPION OF THE
WHOLE WORLD," CASSIUS TOLD

09:25.012 --> 09:27.049
DELEGATES FROM AFRICA
AND ASIA,

09:27.083 --> 09:30.811
WHO EAGERLY OFFERED TO HOST HIM
IN THEIR COUNTRIES.

09:30.846 --> 09:33.849
THE BOXER ALSO ANNOUNCED
THAT HE INTENDED TO MOVE

09:33.883 --> 09:35.333
TO NEW YORK.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.163
WELL, YES,
I'M LOOK--SCOUTING NOW,

09:38.198 --> 09:39.786
AND SOME HOME
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN

09:39.820 --> 09:41.235
I'LL SOON BE PICKING.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.616
IS THIS
THE REASON FOR YOUR--

09:42.651 --> 09:44.273
THIS PARTICULAR TRIP
TO NEW YORK?

09:44.307 --> 09:46.344
WELL, YES, I HAVE
ENTERPRISE SET UP HERE.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.104
I'M INCORPORATED NOW,
AND I HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESS

09:48.139 --> 09:49.761
TO ATTEND TO.

09:49.796 --> 09:51.038
AND LIKE I SAID, THIS IS
THE CENTER OF THE WORLD.

09:51.073 --> 09:53.144
A WHOLE LOT IS
GOING ON HERE.

09:53.178 --> 09:56.630
IN CHICAGO,
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD FUMED.

09:56.665 --> 10:00.220
HE ORDERED CLAY TO STOP
SEEING MALCOLM IMMEDIATELY.

10:00.254 --> 10:03.154
THE NEXT DAY,
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD MADE A MOVE

10:03.188 --> 10:06.053
INTENDED TO SECURE
THE BOXER'S ALLEGIANCE

10:06.088 --> 10:09.298
AND PERMANENTLY MARGINALIZE
MALCOLM X.

10:09.332 --> 10:11.645
"THIS CLAY NAME HAS
NO DIVINE MEANING,"

10:11.680 --> 10:13.958
HE DECLARED IN A RADIO ADDRESS.

10:13.992 --> 10:15.338
"I HOPE HE WILL
ACCEPT BEING CALLED

10:15.373 --> 10:17.858
"BY ANOTHER NAME.

10:17.893 --> 10:20.723
"MUHAMMAD ALI IS WHAT
I WILL GIVE TO HIM

10:20.758 --> 10:25.417
AS LONG AS HE BELIEVES
IN ALLAH AND FOLLOWS ME."

10:25.452 --> 10:27.937
FOR ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,
IT WAS A BRILLIANT STROKE

10:27.972 --> 10:31.113
BECAUSE IT PULLED MUHAMMAD ALI
TOWARD ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

10:31.147 --> 10:32.804
AT A TIME WHEN HE COULD'VE
GONE EITHER WAY.

10:32.839 --> 10:34.737
HE COULD'VE GONE TOWARD MALCOLM.

10:34.772 --> 10:36.981
HE COULD'VE SPLIT
FROM THE NATION OF ISLAM,

10:37.015 --> 10:41.088
BUT ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,
BY GRANTING ALI THIS HONOR,

10:41.123 --> 10:46.059
THIS SPECIAL NAME WAS
SAYING, "YOU'RE MY SON.

10:46.093 --> 10:51.374
YOU ARE, SPECIAL TO ME,"
AND THAT CEMENTED THEIR BOND.

10:51.409 --> 10:54.170
MEANWHILE, MALCOLM
TRIED REPEATEDLY TO REACH

10:54.205 --> 10:57.346
THE BOXER BY PHONE
AT THE HOTEL THERESA,

10:57.380 --> 11:01.074
BUT EACH CALL WAS ANSWERED
BY ONE OF ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S MEN.

11:01.108 --> 11:04.353
THEY REFUSED TO LET MALCOLM
SPEAK TO HIS FRIEND.

11:04.387 --> 11:05.975
WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON BEING CALLED

11:06.010 --> 11:07.321
MUHAMMAD ALI NOW?

11:07.356 --> 11:08.978
THAT'S THE NAME
GIVEN TO ME BY MY LEADER

11:09.013 --> 11:10.704
AND TEACHER, THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

11:10.739 --> 11:12.395
THAT'S MY ORIGINAL NAME,
THAT'S A BLACK MAN NAME.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.880
CASSIUS CLAY WAS
MY SLAVE NAME.

11:13.914 --> 11:15.778
I'M NO LONGER A SLAVE.

11:15.813 --> 11:17.090
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

11:17.124 --> 11:18.712
MUHAMMAD MEANS
"WORTHY OF ALL PRAISES,"

11:18.747 --> 11:21.715
AND ALI MEANS "MOST HIGH."

11:21.750 --> 11:23.130
DO YOU INTEND TO
FIGHT UNDER THAT NAME?

11:23.165 --> 11:24.718
YES, SIR. I WANT TO BE
CALLED BY THAT NAME,

11:24.753 --> 11:26.237
I WRITE AUTOGRAPHS
WITH THAT NAME.

11:26.271 --> 11:28.308
I WANT TO BE KNOWN ALL OVER
THE WORLD AS THAT NAME,

11:28.342 --> 11:30.137
ESPECIALLY THROUGHOUT
ASIA AND AFRICA

11:30.172 --> 11:33.140
BECAUSE THAT'S THE NAMES
OF OUR PEOPLE OVER HOME.

11:33.175 --> 11:34.901
MALCOLM X,
YOU'VE BEEN VERY CLOSE

11:34.935 --> 11:37.213
TO THE NEW HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION CASSIUS CLAY.

11:37.248 --> 11:40.285
DO YOU EXPECT THAT HE
MIGHT LEAVE THE NATION
OF ISLAM WITH YOU?

11:40.320 --> 11:43.875
NO. AS I STATED
EARLIER TODAY,

11:43.910 --> 11:46.326
IT'S NOT MY INTENTION
TO ENCOURAGE ANY MUSLIM

11:46.360 --> 11:48.155
WHO FOLLOWS THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

11:48.190 --> 11:49.847
TO LEAVE HIM.

11:49.881 --> 11:51.987
IN FACT, IT'S MY INTENTION
TO ENCOURAGE ALL MUSLIMS

11:52.021 --> 11:54.196
TO REMAIN UNDER
THE SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE

11:54.230 --> 11:55.991
OF THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

11:56.025 --> 11:58.752
THAT INCLUDES CASSIUS CLAY.

11:58.787 --> 12:01.237
HAVING WON
MUHAMMAD ALI'S LOYALTY,

12:01.272 --> 12:04.482
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD CUT OFF
MALCOLM X ENTIRELY,

12:04.516 --> 12:07.071
FORCING HIM AND HIS FAMILY
FROM THE HOME

12:07.105 --> 12:10.419
THE NATION OF ISLAM
HAD PROVIDED.

12:10.453 --> 12:13.767
FOLLOWED EVERYWHERE BY MEMBERS
OF THE FRUIT OF ISLAM,

12:13.802 --> 12:16.080
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S
SECURITY FORCE,

12:16.114 --> 12:19.324
MALCOLM X PUBLICLY
QUIT THE SECT.

12:19.359 --> 12:21.361
HE REMAINED A MUSLIM
BUT WOULD CREATE

12:21.395 --> 12:23.432
HIS OWN MOVEMENT COMMITTED
TO REACHING

12:23.466 --> 12:27.194
ALL AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

12:27.229 --> 12:29.507
IN THE MONTHS AHEAD,
MALCOLM WOULD MAKE

12:29.541 --> 12:32.924
A PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA
THAT WOULD RESHAPE HIS ATTITUDES

12:32.959 --> 12:34.961
TOWARD ISLAM.

12:34.995 --> 12:36.963
HE WAS WILLING NOW TO COOPERATE

12:36.997 --> 12:40.345
WITH NON-VIOLENT
CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS,

12:40.380 --> 12:42.900
AND HE WOULD LIVE EACH DAY
UNDER THE THREAT

12:42.934 --> 12:47.559
OF VIOLENCE
FROM THE NATION OF ISLAM.

12:47.594 --> 12:49.803
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE HEADED
FOR CHICAGO

12:49.838 --> 12:53.807
LATER ON THIS
AFTERNOON TO MEET
WITH ELIJAH MUHAMMAD?

12:53.842 --> 12:55.567
YES, SIR.
HAVING DINNER WITH HIM.

12:55.602 --> 12:58.812
UH-HUH. ONE OF
THE MAIN REASONS

12:58.847 --> 13:00.503
IS YOUR FRIENDSHIP
WITH MALCOLM X

13:00.538 --> 13:02.436
FOR YOU JOINING
THE BLACK MUSLIMS,
WASN'T IT?

13:02.471 --> 13:05.957
NO, I WAS A MUSLIM
4 YEARS BEFORE I MET
MALCOLM X.

13:05.992 --> 13:07.510
OH, REALLY?

13:07.545 --> 13:09.098
HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS
NOW THOUGH, ISN'T HE?

13:09.133 --> 13:11.445
MM-HMM. YES.
HE'S A BROTHER OF MINE.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.413
HE'S MY BROTHER.
WHATEVER HE DO,
HE'S MY BROTHER.

13:13.447 --> 13:16.140
UH-HUH. NOW THAT
HE'S SPLIT AWAY
FROM THE MUSLIMS--

13:16.174 --> 13:17.866
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
SPLITTING.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.109
I'LL HAVE TO SEE
A HIGHER AUTHORITY ON THAT.

13:20.144 --> 13:21.835
THAT'S ONE OF MY MAIN
REASONS FOR GOING

13:21.870 --> 13:23.457
IS TO FIND OUT
THE REAL STORY.

13:23.492 --> 13:28.428
I DON'T BELIEVE NOTHING
THE PRESS AND PEOPLE WRITE.

13:28.462 --> 13:31.224
AT HIS CHICAGO
MANSION, ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

13:31.258 --> 13:34.537
LECTURED ALI AND HIS
BROTHER RUDY ON ALLAH,

13:34.572 --> 13:37.264
DISCUSSED THE BOXER'S FUTURE,
AND PROMISED

13:37.299 --> 13:40.854
TO FIND HIM
A MUSLIM WOMAN TO MARRY.

13:40.889 --> 13:43.857
HE ALSO INTRODUCED ALI TO
HIS SON HERBERT, THE OWNER

13:43.892 --> 13:49.173
OF A PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO
AND EDITOR OF "MUHAMMAD SPEAKS."

13:49.207 --> 13:53.384
IN TIME, ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
AND HIS SON WOULD CONTROL

13:53.418 --> 13:56.974
NEARLY EVERY ASPECT
OF ALI'S LIFE.

14:02.082 --> 14:04.015
BACK IN NEW YORK,
THE NEW CHAMPION

14:04.050 --> 14:07.881
WAS BESIEGED BY REPORTERS,
MOST OF WHOM FORGOT--

14:07.916 --> 14:10.470
OR DECLINED--TO CALL HIM
BY HIS NEW NAME.

14:10.504 --> 14:12.437
CASSIUS,
WHEN THE FIGHT WAS OVER,
YOU RAISED YOUR HANDS...

14:12.472 --> 14:14.957
ATTENDING A FIGHT
AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,

14:14.992 --> 14:18.616
HE INSISTED ON BEING
INTRODUCED AS MUHAMMAD ALI.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.584
THE BOUT'S PROMOTERS REFUSED.

14:21.619 --> 14:24.518
"I PITY CLAY AND ABHOR WHAT
HE REPRESENTS,"

14:24.553 --> 14:27.245
WROTE THE VETERAN SPORTSWRITER
JIMMY CANNON.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.903
HE ACCUSED THE BOXER
OF USING HIS FAITH

14:29.938 --> 14:34.149
AS A "WEAPON OF WICKEDNESS
IN AN ATTACK ON THE SPIRIT."

14:34.183 --> 14:37.048
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.
CHARGED THAT ALI

14:37.083 --> 14:41.294
HAD BECOME "A CHAMPION
OF RACIAL SEGREGATION."

14:41.328 --> 14:44.124
FORMER CHAMPION
FLOYD PATTERSON, A CATHOLIC,

14:44.159 --> 14:47.231
COMPARED THE NATION
OF ISLAM TO THE KU KLUX KLAN

14:47.265 --> 14:50.027
AND OFFERED TO FIGHT
FOR FREE IN ORDER TO WREST

14:50.061 --> 14:53.547
THE TITLE FROM CLAY
AND THE BLACK MUSLIMS.

14:53.582 --> 14:55.342
WELL, I MADE,
THE CHALLENGE TO CASSIUS CLAY

14:55.377 --> 15:00.002
BECAUSE I FEEL THAT
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

15:00.037 --> 15:04.593
BELONGS TO ALL AMERICANS,
AND IT'S SOMETHING

15:04.627 --> 15:06.940
THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF,

15:06.975 --> 15:09.115
ALL AMERICANS
SHOULD BE PROUD OF.

15:09.149 --> 15:12.014
I ALSO FEEL THAT IT SHOULD NOT
BE IN THE HANDS OF ONE GROUP

15:12.049 --> 15:15.086
OF PEOPLE,
AND THAT'S THE MUSLIMS.

15:15.121 --> 15:18.262
BEFORE HE LEFT TOWN,
ALI LEARNED THAT, DUE

15:18.296 --> 15:20.989
TO HIS LOW SCORE
ON AN APTITUDE TEST

15:21.023 --> 15:24.164
HE WAS UNQUALIFIED TO SERVE
IN THE MILITARY.

15:24.199 --> 15:27.478
THE "
MADE IT FRONT PAGE NEWS.

15:27.512 --> 15:29.963
"I JUST SAID I WAS
THE GREATEST," ALI SAID.

15:29.998 --> 15:32.414
"I NEVER SAID
I WAS THE SMARTEST."

15:36.521 --> 15:39.593
IN MAY,
ALI BEGAN A MONTH-LONG TOUR

15:39.628 --> 15:41.975
OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES.

15:42.010 --> 15:45.358
IN ACCRA, THE CAPITAL
OF GHANA, THOUSANDS GATHERED

15:45.392 --> 15:47.601
AT THE AIRPORT TO CATCH
A GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD'S

15:47.636 --> 15:49.638
NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION.

15:52.123 --> 15:55.644
OUTSIDE HIS HOTEL,
ALI HEARD A FAMILIAR VOICE.

15:55.678 --> 15:58.164
"BROTHER MUHAMMAD," CALLED
MALCOLM X, WHO WAS

15:58.198 --> 16:00.476
ON HIS OWN OVERSEAS TOUR.

16:00.511 --> 16:03.272
HE GREETED ALI ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

16:03.307 --> 16:06.724
"I STILL LOVE YOU,"
HE TOLD THE BOXER."

16:06.758 --> 16:10.624
"YOU LEFT THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD," ALI SAID.

16:10.659 --> 16:14.180
"THAT WAS THE WRONG THING
TO DO."

16:14.214 --> 16:16.527
THERE WAS LITTLE ELSE TO SAY.

16:16.561 --> 16:20.669
MALCOLM WALKED AWAY.

16:20.703 --> 16:24.500
ALI MET WITH GHANAIAN
PRESIDENT KWAME NKRUMAH,

16:24.535 --> 16:27.641
SPARRED WITH HIS BROTHER RUDY,
NOW KNOWN AS RAHMAN,

16:27.676 --> 16:31.024
BEFORE THOUSANDS
AT A LOCAL SPORTS STADIUM,

16:31.059 --> 16:34.683
AND TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY
TO ENGAGE THE ADMIRERS

16:34.717 --> 16:37.720
WHO TURNED UP EVERYWHERE
ALI WENT.

16:37.755 --> 16:40.033
HE ALSO SPOKE OUT
AGAINST INTEGRATION

16:40.068 --> 16:42.070
IN AMERICA, ADVOCATING

16:42.104 --> 16:44.486
FOR A SEPARATE STATE
FOR BLACK PEOPLE,

16:44.520 --> 16:46.591
AND DISMISSED THE SWEEPING
CIVIL RIGHTS BILL

16:46.626 --> 16:49.353
UNDER CONSIDERATION
IN THE U.S. CONGRESS

16:49.387 --> 16:52.287
AS "COUNTERFEIT MONEY."

16:52.321 --> 16:55.393
LATER, HE VISITED
NIGERIA AND EGYPT,

16:55.428 --> 16:57.499
WHERE HE
AND HERBERT MUHAMMAD MET

16:57.533 --> 17:01.468
WITH PRESIDENT GAMAL ABDEL
NASSER AND PRAYED

17:01.503 --> 17:06.508
WITH 1,500 WORSHIPPERS
AT CAIRO'S AL-HUSSEIN MOSQUE.

17:08.648 --> 17:11.168
THE DEEP AFFECTION AFRICANS
SHOWERED ON ALI

17:11.202 --> 17:15.344
DURING HIS 5-WEEK TRIP SHOWED
THAT HIS SUCCESS IN THE RING

17:15.379 --> 17:20.211
AND OUTSPOKENNESS BEYOND IT HAD
WON HIM AN ENORMOUS FOLLOWING

17:20.246 --> 17:23.111
WELL BEYOND THE UNITED STATES.

17:23.145 --> 17:25.734
WELL, REMEMBER THAT
THE AFRICAN CONTINENT ITSELF

17:25.768 --> 17:28.392
WAS IN THE THROWS OF LIBERATION,
YOU KNOW,

17:28.426 --> 17:31.602
FROM COLONIAL STATUS.

17:31.636 --> 17:34.708
IT WAS LIBERATION TIME,
AND MUHAMMAD ALI WAS

17:34.743 --> 17:37.573
A FIGURE OF LIBERATION.

17:37.608 --> 17:40.335
BEFORE LEAVING
AFRICA, ALI RECEIVED

17:40.369 --> 17:43.476
A CABLE FROM
HIS FORMER FRIEND AND MENTOR.

17:43.510 --> 17:46.548
"BECAUSE A BILLION OF OUR
PEOPLE IN AFRICA, ASIA,

17:46.582 --> 17:50.138
"AND ARABIA LOVE YOU BLINDLY,
YOU MUST NOW BE

17:50.172 --> 17:52.864
FOREVER AWARE OF YOUR TREMENDOUS
RESPONSIBILITY TO THEM,"

17:52.899 --> 17:55.177
MALCOLM X WROTE.

17:55.212 --> 17:57.593
"YOU MUST NEVER DO OR SAY
ANYTHING THAT WILL PERMIT

17:57.628 --> 18:00.734
"YOUR ENEMIES TO DISTORT
THE BEAUTIFUL IMAGE YOU HAVE

18:00.769 --> 18:03.565
HERE AMONG OUR PEOPLE."

18:03.599 --> 18:05.636
I FRANKLY
BELIEVE THAT CASSIUS IS

18:05.670 --> 18:08.880
IN A BETTER POSITION
THAN ANYONE ELSE TO RESTORE

18:08.915 --> 18:13.195
THE UH, UH--A SENSE
OF RACIAL PRIDE

18:13.230 --> 18:14.886
TO NOT ONLY OUR PEOPLE
IN THIS COUNTRY

18:14.921 --> 18:16.578
BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD,

18:16.612 --> 18:20.340
AND HE IS TRYING HIS BEST TO
LIVE A CLEAN LIFE

18:20.375 --> 18:23.550
AND PROJECT A CLEAN IMAGE,
BUT DESPITE THIS,

18:23.585 --> 18:26.243
YOU FIND THE PRESS IS CONSTANTLY
TRYING TO PAINT HIM

18:26.277 --> 18:28.348
AS SOMETHING OTHER
THAN WHAT HE ACTUALLY IS.

18:28.383 --> 18:30.419
HE DOESN'T SMOKE,
HE DOESN'T DRINK.

18:30.454 --> 18:32.663
IN FACT, IF HE WAS WHITE,
THEY WOULD BE REFERRING TO HIM

18:32.697 --> 18:34.354
AS THE ALL-AMERICAN BOY.

18:59.724 --> 19:02.796
REMEMBER, FROM 12 YEARS OLD,
HE'S THIS BOXER IN TRAINING,

19:02.831 --> 19:07.767
AND I SUSPECT THAT
UNTIL HE MARRIED HIS FIRST WIFE

19:07.801 --> 19:15.292
HE HAD NOT HAD
A LOT OF SEXUAL ADVENTURES.

19:15.326 --> 19:18.364
ONE AFTERNOON
IN THE SUMMER OF 1964,

19:18.398 --> 19:21.194
WHILE MUHAMMAD ALI WAS STAYING
AT THE ROBERTS MOTEL

19:21.229 --> 19:23.714
IN CHICAGO,
HERBERT MUHAMMAD STOPPED BY

19:23.748 --> 19:25.405
FOR A VISIT.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.856
HE WAS NOT ALONE.

19:27.890 --> 19:30.893
SONJI ROI WAS A 27-YEAR-OLD
COCKTAIL WAITRESS

19:30.928 --> 19:33.620
AND SOMETIME FASHION MODEL
WHO HAD POSED FOR HERBERT

19:33.655 --> 19:36.830
AT HIS SOUTH SIDE
PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO.

19:36.865 --> 19:38.798
ALI LEAPT UP.

19:38.832 --> 19:41.214
"I SWEAR TO GOD, HERBERT,"
HE EXCLAIMED,

19:41.249 --> 19:44.700
"I WAS LYING ACROSS THE BED
PRAYING TO ALLAH FOR A WIFE,

19:44.735 --> 19:48.394
AND HERE SHE COMES
THROUGH THE DOOR."

19:48.428 --> 19:51.535
THAT EVENING,
THE TWO WENT FOR ICE CREAM,

19:51.569 --> 19:53.847
THEN DINNER,
AND FINALLY RETURNED

19:53.882 --> 19:57.748
TO SONJI'S APARTMENT,
WHERE THEY SPENT THE NIGHT.

19:57.782 --> 19:59.750
HERBERT HAD NOT MEANT
FOR ALI TO FALL IN LOVE

19:59.784 --> 20:02.960
WITH SONJI, A NON-MUSLIM,
BUT THE TWO BECAME

20:02.994 --> 20:05.825
INSTANTLY INSEPARABLE.

20:05.859 --> 20:08.724
JUST 6 WEEKS AFTER MEETING,
THEY WERE MARRIED

20:08.759 --> 20:12.728
IN GARY, INDIANA,
BY A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE.

20:12.763 --> 20:16.249
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY INFATUATED.

20:16.284 --> 20:18.838
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES
I WAS TALKING TO HIM

20:18.872 --> 20:20.978
AND YOU WOULD HEAR THIS
LITTLE VOICE

20:21.012 --> 20:25.707
AT THE HOTEL DOOR SAYING, "ALI,"

20:25.741 --> 20:28.917
AND HE WOULD, "I'LL TALK
TO YOU GUYS LATER."

20:28.951 --> 20:31.402
ON THEIR FIRST
TRIP TO LOUISVILLE,

20:31.437 --> 20:34.612
ALI'S PARENTS QUICKLY TOOK
TO SONJI, WHO HELPED ODESSA

20:34.647 --> 20:37.822
PREPARE FRIED CHICKEN,
PORED OVER ALI'S SCRAPBOOKS,

20:37.857 --> 20:40.342
AND BURST INTO
LAUGHTER WHEN ODESSA CALLED

20:40.377 --> 20:45.036
HER SON BY AN OLD
NICKNAME, "TINKY BABY."

20:45.071 --> 20:47.038
FOR CASSIUS SR. AND ODESSA,

20:47.073 --> 20:50.283
UNABLE TO ABIDE THEIR SON'S
RELIGIOUS CONVERSION

20:50.318 --> 20:51.940
AND WORRIED
THAT THE NATION OF ISLAM

20:51.974 --> 20:55.495
WOULD TAKE HIS BOXING EARNINGS,
SONJI OFFERED HOPE

20:55.530 --> 20:58.015
THAT ALI'S DEVOTION
TO ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

20:58.049 --> 21:00.328
WOULD BE SHORT-LIVED.

21:02.433 --> 21:05.988
HIS PARENTS WERE NOT
ALONE IN THEIR CONCERN.

21:06.023 --> 21:09.026
EVER SINCE ALI HAD PUBLICLY
CONFIRMED HIS MEMBERSHIP

21:09.060 --> 21:10.924
IN THE NATION OF ISLAM,

21:10.959 --> 21:12.719
THE WEALTHY
LOUISVILLE BUSINESSMEN

21:12.754 --> 21:15.653
WHO MANAGED HIS CAREER
HAD STRUGGLED

21:15.688 --> 21:17.897
TO ADJUST
TO THEIR BOXER'S NEW FAITH.

21:17.931 --> 21:20.520
I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT
IT HAS COST CASSIUS

21:20.555 --> 21:22.833
A GREAT DEAL OF OUTSIDE MONEY.

21:22.867 --> 21:25.594
BY OUTSIDE, I MEAN OF COURSE
OUTSIDE THE RING.

21:25.629 --> 21:27.355
MEMBERS OF THE LOUISVILLE
SPONSORING GROUP TOLD HIM

21:27.389 --> 21:29.529
RIGHT AWAY
"THIS IS CAREER SUICIDE.

21:29.564 --> 21:31.911
"WE HAVE BUSINESS
DEALS ON OUR DESK.

21:31.945 --> 21:34.465
COCA-COLA WANTS YOU TO DO ADS,"

21:34.500 --> 21:36.743
AND IN FACT,
THOSE CONTRACTS ALL GO AWAY.

21:36.778 --> 21:39.090
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T CARE.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.092
HE'S DOING WHAT HE BELIEVES IN.

21:41.127 --> 21:42.818
WOULD YOU CARE
TO MAKE AN ESTIMATE

21:42.853 --> 21:44.751
OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU THINK
IT MIGHT HAVE COST HIM?

21:44.786 --> 21:46.822
WELL, UH, MY OWN
PERSONAL OPINION

21:46.857 --> 21:49.653
IS THAT WE COULD HAVE
MADE FOR HIM--

21:49.687 --> 21:52.518
AFTER TAXES--
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
AS YOU KNOW, HARRY--

21:52.552 --> 21:55.797
I BELIEVE WE
COULD HAVE MADE
HIM $1.5 MILLION.

21:55.831 --> 21:57.764
AND THIS
HE HAS SACRIFICED?

21:57.799 --> 22:01.458
AND THIS, I'M AFRAID,
HE HAS SACRIFICED SO FAR.

22:01.492 --> 22:03.977
DOES IT NOT ALSO
EMBARRASS THE KENTUCKY
BUSINESSMEN?

22:04.012 --> 22:07.498
AFTER ALL, HERE
YOU'VE GOT A GROUP
OF KENTUCKY CHRISTIANS

22:07.533 --> 22:09.535
WITH A MUSLIM MOUTHPIECE.

22:09.569 --> 22:15.368
WELL, UH, I DON'T
THINK THAT IT'S BEEN
THAT EMBARRASSING.

22:15.403 --> 22:18.371
NATURALLY, IT'S
BEEN STARTLING.

22:18.406 --> 22:20.373
BUT, UH, IN
THE FIRST PLACE,

22:20.408 --> 22:22.548
MOST OF US FEEL
THAT A MAN HAS A RIGHT

22:22.582 --> 22:24.929
TO HIS OWN RELIGION,
TO HIS OWN FAITH,

22:24.964 --> 22:29.831
AND SECOND PLACE--
AND I HAVE REPEATED
THIS MANY TIMES--

22:29.865 --> 22:33.006
IF THE BLACK MUSLIMS
MEAN HATRED,

22:33.041 --> 22:36.078
THEN CASSIUS
WILL NEVER BE
A TRUE BLACK MUSLIM

22:36.113 --> 22:38.011
BECAUSE HE HAS
NO HATRED FOR ANYBODY

22:38.046 --> 22:40.082
IN HIS SOUL
OR IN HIS MIND.

22:40.117 --> 22:44.432
HE IS A VERY CLEAN,
FINE, NICE YOUNG MAN.

22:44.466 --> 22:47.952
UNTIL THEIR CONTRACT
EXPIRED IN 1966,

22:47.987 --> 22:50.955
IT REMAINED THE LOUISVILLE
GROUP'S JOB TO ARRANGE

22:50.990 --> 22:56.029
ALI'S FIGHTS, A TASK COMPLICATED
BY SOME BOXING OFFICIALS

22:56.064 --> 23:00.793
TROUBLED BY ALI'S ASSOCIATION
WITH THE NATION OF ISLAM.

23:00.827 --> 23:02.415
"CLAY'S CONDUCT,"
THE PRESIDENT

23:02.450 --> 23:04.486
OF THE WORLD BOXING
ASSOCIATION SAID,

23:04.521 --> 23:08.490
"HAS BEEN UNBECOMING
OF A CHAMPION."

23:08.525 --> 23:10.906
WHEN ALI'S SPONSORS ANNOUNCED
A NOVEMBER REMATCH

23:10.941 --> 23:14.427
WITH SONNY LISTON
IN BOSTON, THE W.B.A.

23:14.462 --> 23:16.429
REFUSED TO SANCTION THE BOUT

23:16.464 --> 23:19.915
AND THEN STRIPPED ALI
OF THEIR TITLE.

23:19.950 --> 23:21.192
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING PERSECUTED

23:21.227 --> 23:22.642
FOR SOME REASON?

23:22.677 --> 23:24.437
IF I'M CONDEMNED
FOR BEING A MUSLIM,

23:24.472 --> 23:26.128
YOU CONDEMNING ME BECAUSE
YOU HATE TO SEE A BLACK MAN

23:26.163 --> 23:27.923
STAND ON HIS OWN TWO FEET.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.822
YOU TELLING THE BLACK WORLD
THAT YOU NEVER WANT TO SEE

23:29.856 --> 23:31.513
A BLACK MAN INDEPENDENT,

23:31.548 --> 23:33.550
AND THIS IS
ALL YOU'RE DOING,
AND JUST ONE--

23:33.584 --> 23:35.690
THIS ONLY MAKES ME
BIGGER.

23:35.724 --> 23:37.450
PROMOTERS
WENT AHEAD WITH PLANS

23:37.485 --> 23:39.659
FOR THE FIGHT ANYWAY.

23:39.694 --> 23:42.110
OTHER BOXING ORGANIZATIONS
AND MOST SPORTSWRITERS

23:42.144 --> 23:48.012
AND FANS STILL RECOGNIZED HIM
AS THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION.

23:48.047 --> 23:50.877
ALI RETURNED TO MIAMI TO TRAIN.

23:50.912 --> 23:53.604
SINCE HIS FIRST FIGHT
WITH LISTON IN FEBRUARY,

23:53.639 --> 23:56.676
ALI HAD GROWN HALF AN INCH
TO 6'3"

23:56.711 --> 23:58.989
AND ADDED TWO INCHES
TO HIS BICEPS

23:59.023 --> 24:01.129
AND ONE INCH TO HIS FOREARMS.

24:01.163 --> 24:03.649
"I'M SO BEAUTIFUL,"
ALI DECLARED,

24:03.683 --> 24:06.445
"I SHOULD BE CHISELED IN GOLD."

24:06.479 --> 24:07.756
THIS WILL BE
THE GREATEST PREDICTION

24:07.791 --> 24:09.793
IN THE HISTORY OF ALL BOXING.

24:09.827 --> 24:12.105
I'VE NEVER BEEN WRONG.

24:12.140 --> 24:16.524
TO ALL OF MIAMI,
CHANNEL 4 MADE ME GREAT.

24:16.558 --> 24:19.043
THAT'S WHY I'LL
STOP LISTON IN 8.

24:19.078 --> 24:21.080
HOW WE GONNA GET HIM?GONNA DANCE.

24:21.114 --> 24:22.702
FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY...BUTTERFLY...

24:22.737 --> 24:24.635
AND STING LIKE A BEE. AHH!

24:24.670 --> 24:27.914
RUMBLE,
YOUNG MAN RUMBLE! AHH!

24:29.709 --> 24:31.711
SONNY LISTON,
DETERMINED TO AVENGE

24:31.746 --> 24:35.888
HIS EARLIER LOSS, TRAINED
FURIOUSLY FOR THE REMATCH.

24:35.922 --> 24:38.891
HE SWORE OFF ALCOHOL,
RAN IN THE FOOTHILLS WEST

24:38.925 --> 24:41.583
OF HIS DENVER HOME,
AND TOOK INSTRUCTION

24:41.618 --> 24:43.861
IN MARTIAL ARTS.

24:43.896 --> 24:46.864
BY NOVEMBER, HE WAS
10 POUNDS LIGHTER

24:46.899 --> 24:49.522
THAN HE HAD BEEN IN MIAMI.

24:52.111 --> 24:55.045
3 DAYS BEFORE
THE FIGHT AT THE BOSTON GARDEN,

24:55.079 --> 24:56.805
ALI AND HIS ENTOURAGE
HAD DINNER

24:56.840 --> 25:00.913
IN HIS SUITE
AT THE SHERRY BILTMORE HOTEL.

25:00.947 --> 25:06.228
SOON, ALI BEGAN TO COMPLAIN
OF PAIN IN HIS STOMACH.

25:06.263 --> 25:09.162
AND HE SAID "GET ME--
GET ME TO A DOCTOR."

25:09.197 --> 25:12.925
SO AT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW,
AS I SAY, WE WAS HATED.

25:12.959 --> 25:15.721
I THOUGHT SOMEBODY
HAD POISONED HIM.

25:15.755 --> 25:17.516
HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION CASSIUS CLAY IS

25:17.550 --> 25:19.656
AT THIS MOMENT UNDERGOING
AN EMERGENCY OPERATION

25:19.690 --> 25:22.175
FOR AN INCARCERATED HERNIA
AT BOSTON CITY HOSPITAL.

25:22.210 --> 25:25.282
CLAY WAS RUSHED TO
THE HOSPITAL EARLY TONIGHT.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.560
THE OPERATION
WAS A SUCCESS,

25:27.595 --> 25:29.562
BUT IT WOULD BE
3 MONTHS BEFORE ALI COULD

25:29.597 --> 25:31.978
RESUME HEAVY TRAINING.

25:32.013 --> 25:34.187
THE FIGHT WAS POSTPONED.

25:34.222 --> 25:37.018
MR. CLAY,
YOU LET US KNOW IF
YOU GET TIRED, OK?

25:37.052 --> 25:39.054
SONNY LISTON HAD
GOTTEN INTO THE BEST SHAPE

25:39.089 --> 25:40.918
OF HIS LIFE.

25:40.953 --> 25:44.128
"THAT DAMNED FOOL," HE SAID
WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS.

25:44.163 --> 25:47.131
THEN HE MIXED HIMSELF
A SCREWDRIVER.

25:51.826 --> 25:54.173
MALCOLM, A STORY
UNDER THE BYLINE
OF AUBREY BARNETT

25:54.207 --> 25:56.831
IN A CURRENT ISSUE
OF A NATIONAL MAGAZINE

25:56.865 --> 25:59.903
SAYS THAT
THE BLACK MUSLIMS
ARE A FRAUD.

25:59.937 --> 26:01.836
WHAT IS YOUR
COMMENT ON THIS?

26:01.870 --> 26:07.220
WELL, UH, AUBREY BARNETT
IS A VERY INTELLIGENT,
UH, PERSON,

26:07.255 --> 26:10.154
AND HE HAS A FINE
ACADEMIC BACKGROUND,

26:10.189 --> 26:13.917
AND I THINK THAT
THE STORY IN ITSELF
WAS VERY ANALYTICAL,

26:13.951 --> 26:15.988
AND IT WAS OBJECTIVE,
AND IT WAS TRUE.

26:16.022 --> 26:17.990
HE SAYS THEY'RE
ANOTHER LITTLE
MONEY-GRABBING SCHEME,

26:18.024 --> 26:19.681
FEEDING ON NEGRO
FRUSTRATIONS.

26:19.716 --> 26:20.855
IS THIS TRUE?

26:20.889 --> 26:22.926
WELL, IF IT IS--
AND IT IS--

26:22.960 --> 26:25.135
THAT'S WHAT IT
HAS DETERIORATED TO.

26:25.169 --> 26:27.862
UH, YOU STILL CAN'T,
UH, BLAME THE NEGRO,

26:27.896 --> 26:29.933
AND YOU CAN'T BLAME
THE MOVEMENT.

26:29.967 --> 26:31.693
YOU HAVE TO BLAME
THE SOCIETY THAT LETS

26:31.728 --> 26:35.697
SUCH FRUSTRATIONS DEVELOP
UNTIL, UH, THIS IS

26:35.732 --> 26:38.148
THE RESULT OF IT.

26:38.182 --> 26:42.152
ON FEBRUARY 21,
1965, WHILE ADDRESSING

26:42.186 --> 26:45.155
A CROWD AT THE AUDUBON BALLROOM
IN MANHATTAN,

26:45.189 --> 26:47.019
MALCOLM X WAS SHOT DEAD.

26:47.053 --> 26:48.641
- - 21 P.M.,
NEW YORK TIME,

26:48.676 --> 26:50.332
21 IN THE EVENING
OVER HERE,

26:50.367 --> 26:53.715
MALCOLM X ROSE TO SPEAK
TO HIS FOLLOWERS IN HARLEM.

26:53.750 --> 26:57.201
ONE MINUTE LATER, HE WAS
SHOT DOWN BY 10 BULLETS.

26:57.236 --> 26:59.341
18 MINUTES LATER, HE WAS DEAD.

26:59.376 --> 27:02.137
THOUGH IT WAS UNCLEAR
WHO ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION,

27:02.172 --> 27:05.209
ALL 3 OF THE GUNMEN WHO
WERE ARRESTED WERE MEMBERS

27:05.244 --> 27:07.626
OF THE NATION OF ISLAM.

27:09.938 --> 27:13.804
THE WAY I SEE IT MALCOLM IS

27:13.839 --> 27:16.393
THE VICTIM OF HIS OWN PREACHING.

27:16.427 --> 27:18.084
HE PREACHED VIOLENCE,

27:18.119 --> 27:19.914
AND SO HE BECOME
THE VICTIM OF IT.

27:19.948 --> 27:22.364
MR. MEL FISHER HERE
FROM UNITED PRESS.

27:22.399 --> 27:24.228
MRS. MALCOLM X,
YOUR HUSBAND

27:24.263 --> 27:26.886
HAD A GREAT
MANY FOLLOWERS.

27:26.921 --> 27:28.819
WHAT WILL BE THEIR
REACTION TO WHAT

27:28.854 --> 27:30.096
HAS HAPPENED TO HIM?

27:30.131 --> 27:32.133
NEXT QUESTION.

27:32.167 --> 27:34.376
DO YOU FEEL THAT
THE POLICE NOW HAVE
IN THEIR CUSTODY

27:34.411 --> 27:37.656
THE MAN OR MEN
WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEATH

27:37.690 --> 27:39.968
OF, UH, YOUR HUSBAND?

27:43.696 --> 27:45.353
THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL,

27:45.387 --> 27:48.114
MUHAMMAD ALI BOXED
IN AN EXHIBITION MATCH

27:48.149 --> 27:52.360
AT A NATION OF ISLAM EVENT
IN CHICAGO.

27:52.394 --> 27:56.744
MALCOLM X AND ANYBODY
ELSE WHO ATTACKS OR TALKS

27:56.778 --> 28:00.230
ABOUT ATTACKING
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD WILL DIE.

28:00.264 --> 28:04.441
NO MAN CAN OPPOSE
THE MESSENGER OF ALMIGHTY GOD

28:04.475 --> 28:07.996
VERBALLY OR PHYSICALLY
AND GET AWAY WITH IT.

28:14.416 --> 28:17.454
IN MAY OF 1965,
MUHAMMAD ALI

28:17.488 --> 28:20.871
AND HIS ENTOURAGE RETURNED
TO MASSACHUSETTS,

28:20.906 --> 28:24.116
WHERE HE CONTINUED TRAINING FOR
HIS REMATCH WITH SONNY LISTON.

28:24.150 --> 28:25.945
I'M GONNA
RUN THE BEAR UP A TREE.

28:25.980 --> 28:27.429
IT'S UP TO YOU TO
GET HIM OUT OF THE TREE.

28:27.464 --> 28:28.948
JUST POINT HIM OUT.

28:28.983 --> 28:30.709
I'LL SHOW HIM TO YOU.

28:30.743 --> 28:33.021
BUT LESS THAN
3 WEEKS BEFORE THE BOUT,

28:33.056 --> 28:35.437
BOSTON'S DISTRICT
ATTORNEY, CONCERNED

28:35.472 --> 28:39.925
ABOUT THE PROMOTERS' MOB TIES,
SUED TO STOP THE FIGHT.

28:41.443 --> 28:44.826
BEFORE A JUDGE COULD RULE,
A PAWNSHOP OWNER

28:44.861 --> 28:48.036
AND SOMETIME BOXING
PROMOTER IN LEWISTON, MAINE,

28:48.071 --> 28:51.868
OFFERED THE TOWN'S HOCKEY RINK.

28:51.902 --> 28:54.802
THE MATCH IS SET
FOR THE ARENA THAT IS

28:54.836 --> 28:59.772
THE HOME ICE OF THE FLYING DOM'S
CYO HOCKEY TEAM,

28:59.807 --> 29:02.292
AND NOBODY IN LEWISTON
WAS OPPOSED TO ALI.

29:02.326 --> 29:04.052
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE WAS

29:04.087 --> 29:06.330
AT THAT POINT.

29:06.365 --> 29:10.369
3 DAYS BEFORE
THE FIGHT, ABC's HOWARD COSELL,

29:10.403 --> 29:12.854
A LAWYER TURNED
SPORTSCASTER FROM BROOKLYN,

29:12.889 --> 29:16.375
BROUGHT A CAMERA CREW
TO ALI'S TRAINING CAMP.

29:16.409 --> 29:20.379
HOWARD COSELL CALLED
HIM CASSIUS CLAY FOR A WHILE,

29:20.413 --> 29:22.484
BUT HE GOT IT EARLY.

29:22.519 --> 29:25.315
HE GOT IT EARLIER,
CERTAINLY THAN MOST,

29:25.349 --> 29:29.043
CERTAINLY THAN MOST WHITE PEOPLE
AND PEOPLE ON TELEVISION,

29:29.077 --> 29:31.355
AND ALI APPRECIATED THIS,

29:31.390 --> 29:33.944
AND ALI STARTED
GIVING HIM ACCESS

29:33.979 --> 29:38.431
AND STARTED MAKING HIM HIS KIND
OF MEDIA WINGMAN.

29:38.466 --> 29:42.194
THEY WERE GOOD FOR EACH OTHER,
AND THEY BOTH KNEW IT.

29:42.228 --> 29:44.196
AND HERE
FULLY ROBED AFTER THE WORKOUT

29:44.230 --> 29:46.439
YOU'VE JUST SEEN COMES
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

29:46.474 --> 29:47.855
OF THE WORLD HIMSELF.

29:47.889 --> 29:49.304
GOOD TO SEE YOU, CHAMP.

29:49.339 --> 29:51.203
HOWARD COSELL, THE WORLD'S
GREATEST NEWSCASTER.

29:51.237 --> 29:52.376
HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

29:52.411 --> 29:53.826
YOU'RE VERY
KIND, CHAMP,

29:53.861 --> 29:55.172
BUT LET'S GET
TO CASES.

29:55.207 --> 29:56.380
YOU LOOK ALMOST
LIKE YOU'RE READY

29:56.415 --> 29:57.899
FOR THE FIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

29:57.934 --> 29:59.004
YOU ABOUT RIGHT.
ALMOST READY.

29:59.038 --> 30:00.419
AFTER ANOTHER WEEK.

30:00.453 --> 30:02.421
I'M A LITTLE TIRED NOW,
I'M WORKING HARD,

30:02.455 --> 30:04.837
BUT FOR THE BIG NIGHT,
I'LL BE READY.

30:04.872 --> 30:06.839
I NOTICED YOU'VE
STOPPED WITH THE POETRY.

30:06.874 --> 30:09.117
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY PREDICTIONS.
HOW COME?

30:09.152 --> 30:12.914
WELL, I'M JUST--I HAVE
A PREDICTION FOR THE FIGHT,

30:12.949 --> 30:18.402
BUT, UH, I'M--I THINK
I'LL BE WISE NOT TO RELEASE IT

30:18.437 --> 30:21.474
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN MY PREDICTIONS,

30:21.509 --> 30:24.098
AND THEY HAVE BEEN
ACCURATE UP TO DATE.

30:24.132 --> 30:26.169
I'M AFRAID THAT I MIGHT
HURT THE GATE IF I LET THEM

30:26.203 --> 30:28.447
KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,
SO I'LL JUST HOLD

30:28.481 --> 30:30.207
THE SURPRISE FOR THEM.

30:30.242 --> 30:32.244
LET ME SAY THIS
TO YOU. GOOD LUCK.

30:32.278 --> 30:34.177
I HOPE IT'S NOT AN ACT.
I HOPE YOU MEAN IT.

30:34.211 --> 30:36.869
IF IT'S AN ACT, JUST
LOOK AT MY RECORD AND SEE.

30:36.904 --> 30:39.078
HAVE THE OTHER
FIGHTS BEEN ACTS?

30:39.113 --> 30:41.011
HAVE THEY BEEN ACTS?NOT SO FAR.

30:41.046 --> 30:43.980
WELL, WHAT MAKES
YOU THINK I'M ACTING?

30:44.014 --> 30:45.913
AHH!

30:45.947 --> 30:49.226
AND WITH THAT
FINAL STAGE OF THE ACT,

30:49.261 --> 30:51.401
WE LEAVE THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD

30:51.435 --> 30:53.921
MUHAMMAD ALI OR CASSIUS CLAY,
AS YOU WILL,

30:53.955 --> 30:56.889
HERE AT HIS TRAINING CAMP
IN CHICOPEE, MASSACHUSETTS.

30:56.924 --> 30:58.442
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU
FOR A VISIT

30:58.477 --> 31:01.342
TO THE CHALLENGER'S CAMP
IN POLAND SPRING, MAINE,

31:01.376 --> 31:03.309
RIGHT AFTER THIS MESSAGE.

31:04.621 --> 31:07.106
AS THE MATCH
NEARED, RUMORS FLEW

31:07.141 --> 31:09.108
THAT SONNY LISTON WOULD
BE KILLED BY MEMBERS

31:09.143 --> 31:12.525
OF THE NATION OF ISLAM
UNLESS HE THREW THE FIGHT

31:12.560 --> 31:15.183
AND THAT A CARLOAD
OF MALCOLM X's FOLLOWERS,

31:15.218 --> 31:18.324
BENT ON REVENGE, WERE DRIVING
NORTH WITH PLANS

31:18.359 --> 31:20.292
TO SHOOT ALI.

31:20.326 --> 31:22.052
WHAT DO I CARE
ABOUT SOME PISTOLS?

31:22.087 --> 31:25.090
CAN'T SCARE ME
WITH NO PISTOLS.

31:25.124 --> 31:28.058
I WALK THROUGH HELL
EVERY DAY, NO GUARDS,

31:28.093 --> 31:29.646
DON'T NEED THEM.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.613
THIS ONLY PROPAGANDA TO
MAKE ME THINK THAT I HAVE

31:31.648 --> 31:33.650
AN ENEMY IN THE RING
AND ONE BEHIND MY BACK

31:33.684 --> 31:37.102
BECAUSE COMMON NATURE TELLS YOU
AND THE NEGRO HERE IN AMERICA

31:37.136 --> 31:39.311
YOU HAVE PUT FEAR IN HIM EVER
SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE,

31:39.345 --> 31:41.485
AND THE ONLY THING YOU
HOPE IS SOME OF IT'S STILL

31:41.520 --> 31:44.661
IN ME, BUT IT AIN'T.

31:44.695 --> 31:47.181
ON THE DAY
OF THE BOUT, OFFICIALS COMBED

31:47.215 --> 31:51.254
THE ARENA ONE LAST TIME
IN SEARCH OF POISON GAS BOMBS

31:51.288 --> 31:55.499
THAT HAD REPORTEDLY BEEN
HIDDEN AMONG THE SUPPORTS.

31:55.534 --> 31:58.330
"IT WILL BE A SHORT FIGHT,"
ALI TOLD A REPORTER

31:58.364 --> 32:02.990
WHO RODE WITH HIM
FROM HIS HOTEL TO THE ARENA.

32:03.024 --> 32:06.407
SONNY LISTON HAD SPENT
THE DAY GRIPPED BY DIARRHEA,

32:06.441 --> 32:09.272
HIS WIFE CONCERNED THAT
HE WASN'T HIMSELF.

32:09.306 --> 32:11.999
RECENT TRAINING SESSIONS
HAD BEEN LACKLUSTER,

32:12.033 --> 32:15.588
AND HE HAD RESUMED DRINKING.

32:15.623 --> 32:18.281
LET'S GO TO
THE CENTRAL MAINE YOUTH CENTER

32:18.315 --> 32:21.940
AND FIGHT ANNOUNCER
JOHNNY ADDIE.

32:21.974 --> 32:26.116
FROM ST. DOMINIC'S
ARENA, LEWISTON, MAINE.

32:26.151 --> 32:30.396
THE WORLD'S HEAVYWEIGHT
BOXING CHAMPIONSHIP.

32:30.431 --> 32:33.675
CASSIUS CLAY, NOW BOUNCING
IN FROM THE DRESSING ROOM

32:33.710 --> 32:37.024
ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ARENA,
LOOSE AND LIMBER

32:37.058 --> 32:39.992
WITH HIS VERY SHORT
TERRYCLOTH ROBE.

32:40.027 --> 32:43.133
COMING INTO THE RING,
UP THE RING STAIRS,

32:43.168 --> 32:45.618
AND HE'S BEING BOOED.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.659
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO GO.

32:51.693 --> 32:53.212
MUHAMMAD ALI SAYING A PRAYER

32:53.247 --> 32:54.420
IN HIS CORNER BEFORE COMING OUT

32:54.455 --> 32:56.388
TO MEET THE CHALLENGER,

32:56.422 --> 32:58.148
AND NOW LET'S GET TO

32:58.183 --> 32:59.287
THE OTHER TELEVISION

32:59.322 --> 33:01.738
COMMENTATOR STEVE ELLIS.

33:01.772 --> 33:04.258
AS YOU KNOW,
15 ROUNDS OR LESS,

33:04.292 --> 33:06.398
THE WORLD'S HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE,
THE BIG FIGHT,

33:06.432 --> 33:09.608
THE BIG NIGHT, UNUSUAL LOCALE,
LEWISTON, MAINE.

33:09.642 --> 33:11.644
ROUND NUMBER ONE.

33:11.679 --> 33:14.475
IF YOU'RE GONNA SCORE WITH US,
WELL, GET YOUR PENCIL

33:14.509 --> 33:17.547
AND PAD HANDY.

33:17.581 --> 33:19.238
WE'RE WAITING
FOR THAT BELL FOR ROUND ONE.

33:19.273 --> 33:20.722
HERE WE GO.

33:20.757 --> 33:23.518
- THE FIGHT BEGAN
- 40 P.M.

33:23.553 --> 33:27.212
LISTON WAS AGAIN THE FAVORITE,
9-TO-5.

33:27.246 --> 33:29.593
HE KNEW THAT THE ONLY WAY
HE COULD WIN

33:29.628 --> 33:33.287
WAS TO GET TO ALI EARLY.

33:33.321 --> 33:35.185
LISTON COMES TEARING
OUT THE CORNER,

33:35.220 --> 33:36.566
AND HE'S THROWING PUNCHES,

33:36.600 --> 33:37.774
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FOO--
YOU KNOW.

33:37.808 --> 33:39.500
WHEN HE MISSES A PUNCH--

33:39.534 --> 33:41.605
ANYBODY MISSES A PUNCH,
THEY'RE OFF BALANCE.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.263
YOU'LL NOTE THAT
CASSIUS WANTS TO STAY OUT

33:44.298 --> 33:46.300
IN THE CENTER OF THE RING,
WHERE HE HAPPENS

33:46.334 --> 33:48.371
TO BE THE KING.

33:55.481 --> 33:58.070
BEAUTIFUL RIGHT-HAND SHOT
THAT YOU SAW.

33:58.105 --> 34:00.038
THAT WAS THE BEST PUNCH
THUS FAR LANDED

34:00.072 --> 34:02.799
BY THE CHAMPION.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.491
WE NOTE THAT EARLY, HALFWAY
THROUGH THIS FIRST ROUND,

34:05.526 --> 34:09.668
THAT SONNY IS SHOOTING MOSTLY
TOWARD THAT BODY.

34:09.702 --> 34:11.394
YOU KNOW THE OLD STORY.

34:11.428 --> 34:14.259
YOU KILL THE BODY,
AND THE HEAD MIGHT FOLLOW.

34:32.311 --> 34:33.795
KNOCKED DOWN,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

34:33.830 --> 34:35.452
WITH A RIGHT-HAND SHOT.

34:35.487 --> 34:38.455
A RIGHT-HAND SHOT
ON THE CHIN.

34:38.490 --> 34:41.320
- 12 INTO THE FIRST ROUND,

34:41.355 --> 34:43.288
SONNY LISTON WENT DOWN.

34:43.322 --> 34:44.496
SONNY CANNOT MOVE.

34:44.530 --> 34:47.464
IT WAS ALL OVER.

34:47.499 --> 34:49.259
THERE WAS A PUNCH.

34:49.294 --> 34:51.675
WAS IT GONNA KEEP HIM DOWN?
HELL, NO.

34:51.710 --> 34:53.815
HE LOOKED UP,
AND THIS GUY WOULD NOT GO

34:53.850 --> 34:55.541
TO A NEUTRAL CORNER,
AND HE'S SCREAMING.

34:55.576 --> 34:57.509
"GET UP SUCKER,
NO ONE'S GONNA BELIEVE IT."

34:57.543 --> 34:59.235
HE GOT HIT HARD.

34:59.269 --> 35:00.857
I HIT HIM WITH A PUNCH
THAT JACK JOHNSON USED

35:00.891 --> 35:02.583
CALLED THE ANCHOR PUNCH.

35:02.617 --> 35:04.343
HOW DOES IT GO?

35:04.378 --> 35:06.449
IT'S A SNAP PUNCH,
AND YOU CAN'T PUNCH IT

35:06.483 --> 35:10.315
UNTIL THE MAN IS
COMING IN AT YOU.

35:10.349 --> 35:12.593
THAT'S ALL. JUST TWIST.

35:12.627 --> 35:14.491
AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT,
BUT IF YOU WERE HIT WITH IT,

35:14.526 --> 35:17.184
ALL OF YOU WOULD BE OUT.

35:17.218 --> 35:18.875
SONNY, DID
THE PUNCH SURPRISE YOU?

35:18.909 --> 35:20.290
CLAY SAYS--YES, IT DID.

35:20.325 --> 35:21.740
CLAY SAYS IT WAS
A NEW TACTIC--

35:21.774 --> 35:23.224
THE COUNTER RIGHT.

35:23.259 --> 35:25.157
IT WAS
A SURPRISING PUNCH.

35:25.192 --> 35:27.366
IT WAS CLEAN SHOT,
BUT IT WASN'T THE KIND OF

35:27.401 --> 35:30.231
CLEAN SHOT TO
KNOCK OUT SONNY LISTON.

35:30.266 --> 35:33.510
WHEN HE GETS KNOCKED DOWN,
IT'S--IT'S BAD ACTING, MAN.

35:33.545 --> 35:35.892
YOU KNOW, LIKE, HORRIBLE ACTING,
AND HE'S, LIKE,

35:35.926 --> 35:38.446
TURNING OVER ON THE--

35:38.481 --> 35:40.621
COME ON, MAN. REALLY SERIOUSLY?

35:40.655 --> 35:43.382
THERE WAS NO WAY
IN THE WORLD THAT MUHAMMAD ALI,

35:43.417 --> 35:45.695
NO MATTER HOW GREAT HE WAS,
WOULD EVER KNOCK OUT

35:45.729 --> 35:47.800
SONNY LISTON WITH ONE SHOT.

35:49.699 --> 35:52.529
TO THIS DAY, THIS IS ONE
OF THE GREAT MYSTERIES

35:52.564 --> 35:55.187
OF THE HISTORY OF SPORTS.

35:55.222 --> 35:57.189
WAS THAT FIGHT FIXED?

35:57.224 --> 35:59.502
DID--DID LISTON TAKE A FALL?

35:59.536 --> 36:02.608
WAS, IN FACT, THE PUNCH
SO IMMENSELY SWIFT

36:02.643 --> 36:04.610
AND DEVASTATING AND HIT
AT JUST THE RIGHT POINT THAT

36:04.645 --> 36:07.199
IT, IN FACT,
WAS A KNOCKOUT PUNCH?

36:07.234 --> 36:09.581
DID LISTON SEE
AFTER WATCHING ALI DANCE

36:09.615 --> 36:11.203
AROUND THE RING,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:11.238 --> 36:12.411
"I'M NOT GONNA CHASE THIS GUY.

36:12.446 --> 36:14.482
"ENOUGH'S ENOUGH,

36:14.517 --> 36:17.175
AND THE FIRST TIME HE HITS ME,
I'M OUT OF HERE."

36:17.209 --> 36:19.487
SO I--I CAN'T PRETEND
TO KNOW FOR CERTAINTY.

36:19.522 --> 36:21.386
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.284
IT'LL HAVE--I THINK,
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS

36:23.319 --> 36:26.218
THAT'S GONNA REMAIN A MYSTERY.

36:26.253 --> 36:29.842
LISTON BOXED
FOR 5 MORE YEARS.

36:29.877 --> 36:35.538
ON JANUARY 5, 1971, HIS WIFE
GERALDINE RETURNED HOME

36:35.572 --> 36:39.404
TO FIND HER HUSBAND DEAD
AT THE FOOT OF THEIR BED.

36:39.438 --> 36:41.751
THOUGH DRUGS HAD BEEN FOUND
AT THE SCENE

36:41.785 --> 36:45.720
AND SOME SPECULATED THAT THE MOB
HAD ORDERED A HIT ON THE BOXER,

36:45.755 --> 36:49.690
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER RULED
THAT SONNY LISTON HAD DIED

36:49.724 --> 36:52.486
OF A HEART ATTACK.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.419
I DON'T THINK THAT
LISTON COULD'VE AVOIDED

36:54.453 --> 36:56.731
WHAT HE BECAME.

36:56.766 --> 36:59.631
THERE WAS SOMETHING, THERE WAS
AN INNER LIGHT TO ALI,

36:59.665 --> 37:01.391
AND THAT LIGHT WAS
GOING TO SHINE,

37:01.426 --> 37:02.910
AND PEOPLE WERE GOING TO
LOVE HIM,

37:02.944 --> 37:05.361
AND THERE WAS
AN INNER DARKNESS TO LISTON,

37:05.395 --> 37:08.985
PUT IN IT BY 500 YEARS
OF PICKING COTTON.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.745
YOU KNOW?

37:10.780 --> 37:14.542
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY--
THEY PLAYED THE CARDS

37:14.577 --> 37:17.683
THEY WERE DEALT.

37:19.927 --> 37:24.242
MEANWHILE,
ALI'S MARRIAGE WAS UNRAVELING.

37:24.276 --> 37:26.934
ALONE IN THEIR CHICAGO
APARTMENT, ALI HAD ALLOWED

37:26.968 --> 37:29.902
SONJI TO WEAR
THE MINI-SKIRTS SHE PREFERRED,

37:29.937 --> 37:31.904
AND HE WOULD SERENADE HER
WITH SONGS

37:31.939 --> 37:37.013
BY SAM COOKE AND BEN E. KING
WHILE SHE COOKED DINNER,

37:37.047 --> 37:40.258
BUT HE NOW GREW UPSET
WHEN SHE APPEARED IN PUBLIC

37:40.292 --> 37:43.330
DRESSED IN A FASHION
HE BELIEVED INAPPROPRIATE

37:43.364 --> 37:46.505
FOR THE WIFE
OF A PRACTICING MUSLIM.

37:46.540 --> 37:51.752
IN JUNE OF 1965, ALI FILED
TO HAVE THEIR MARRIAGE ANNULLED,

37:51.786 --> 37:54.548
COMPLAINING THAT
SONJI HAD FALSELY PROMISED

37:54.582 --> 37:57.482
TO CONVERT TO ISLAM.

37:57.516 --> 38:00.450
"THEY'VE STOLEN MY MAN'S
MIND," SAID SONJI,

38:00.485 --> 38:02.521
WHO BLAMED ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
FOR THE COLLAPSE

38:02.556 --> 38:04.696
OF THEIR MARRIAGE.

38:04.730 --> 38:06.870
"I LOVED HER ONLY IF SHE
WOULD FOLLOW ME

38:06.905 --> 38:08.976
"IN MY WAY OF LIFE.

38:09.010 --> 38:12.013
NEXT TIME I MARRY, IT'LL BE
A GIRL OF 17 OR 18,"

38:12.048 --> 38:16.432
ALI VOWED, "ONE I RAISE TO
MY WAY OF THINKING."

38:20.643 --> 38:22.610
ALI'S COMMITMENT
TO THE NATION OF ISLAM

38:22.645 --> 38:24.543
CONTINUED TO DEEPEN.

38:24.578 --> 38:26.856
HE HAD GROWN ESPECIALLY CLOSE
TO ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S

38:26.890 --> 38:29.721
SON HERBERT, WHO WAS
PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY

38:29.755 --> 38:34.415
DECISIVE ROLE
IN ALI'S BOXING CAREER.

38:34.450 --> 38:36.624
HERBERT HAD A KNACK
FOR MAKING MONEY,

38:36.659 --> 38:40.041
SOMETIMES IN WAYS THAT VIOLATED
HIS FATHER'S TEACHINGS.

38:40.076 --> 38:43.355
ACCORDING TO FBI AGENTS,
HE PHOTOGRAPHED WOMEN

38:43.390 --> 38:46.738
IN THE NUDE,
MADE PORNOGRAPHIC FILMS,

38:46.772 --> 38:51.605
AND SIPHONED MONEY
FROM HIS FATHER'S BUSINESSES.

38:51.639 --> 38:53.607
HERBERT MUHAMMAD IS
THE SON OF ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

38:53.641 --> 38:57.404
SO IN MANY WAYS,
HE'S ALI'S CONNECTION

38:57.438 --> 39:01.511
TO THE RELIGION,
AND HE MENTORS ALI IN THE WAYS

39:01.546 --> 39:03.548
OF THE NATION OF ISLAM,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

39:03.582 --> 39:05.826
HE'S A BUSINESSMAN
WHO REALLY LIKES MONEY,

39:05.860 --> 39:09.416
REALLY LIKES FOOD,
REALLY LIKES WOMEN.

39:09.450 --> 39:10.658
HE LOVED ALI,
AND THEY DEVELOPED

39:10.693 --> 39:13.040
THIS UNBELIEVABLE CLOSENESS.

39:13.074 --> 39:15.732
DURING TRIPS
TO LOUISVILLE, ALI NOW STAYED

39:15.767 --> 39:19.736
AT A HOTEL AND SPENT LESS TIME
WITH HIS PARENTS.

39:19.771 --> 39:21.635
"THE MUSLIMS KEEP HIM
AWAY FROM ME," COMPLAINED

39:21.669 --> 39:25.363
CASSIUS SR., WHO CALLED
HERBERT "DIRTY"

39:25.397 --> 39:29.332
AND WARNED HIS SON THAT HE WAS
GOING TO WIND UP BROKE.

39:31.507 --> 39:35.683
IN SEPTEMBER 1965,
ALI TRAVELED TO NEW YORK

39:35.718 --> 39:37.754
TO ANNOUNCE THAT
HIS NEXT OPPONENT

39:37.789 --> 39:42.103
WOULD BE THE FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION FLOYD PATTERSON.

39:42.138 --> 39:44.934
PATTERSON, NOW 30,
HAD BEEN CAMPAIGNING

39:44.968 --> 39:48.593
FOR A SHOT AT ALI EVER
SINCE HE WON THE TITLE.

39:48.627 --> 39:52.355
HE SAW HIS CHALLENGE
AS A MORAL CRUSADE.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.599
"THE IMAGE OF A BLACK
MUSLIM AS CHAMPION

39:54.633 --> 39:56.877
IS NOT GOOD," HE TOLD THE PRESS.

39:56.911 --> 39:59.397
"CASSIUS MUST BE BEATEN."

39:59.431 --> 40:02.123
PATTERSON SAID HE INTENDED
TO "WIN THE TITLE BACK

40:02.158 --> 40:03.849
FOR AMERICA."

40:03.884 --> 40:05.610
ALI WAS LIVID.

40:05.644 --> 40:07.681
"I'M AN AMERICAN," HE SAID,

40:07.715 --> 40:10.925
"BUT HE'S A DEAF, DUMB,
AND BLIND SO-CALLED NEGRO

40:10.960 --> 40:13.652
WHO NEEDS A SPANKING."

40:13.687 --> 40:15.585
THE PRESS ATE IT UP.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.967
"IT IS CHRISTIAN
AGAINST BLACK MUSLIM.

40:18.001 --> 40:21.073
IT IS GOOD GUY AGAINST
BAD GUY," WROTE DICK YOUNG

40:21.108 --> 40:23.041
OF THE "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS,"

40:23.075 --> 40:24.663
WHO CALLED THE MATCHUP

40:24.698 --> 40:27.148
A HOLY WAR.

40:27.183 --> 40:31.049
FLOYD CAME ACROSS
AS THE WHITE MAN'S APOLOGIST,

40:31.083 --> 40:34.432
AND FOR US AT THAT TIME,
THAT WAS ENOUGH.

40:34.466 --> 40:37.504
THIS WAS DURING THE PERIOD
OF THE LONG, HOT SUMMER RIOTS.

40:37.538 --> 40:39.091
REBELLION WAS IN THE AIR.

40:39.126 --> 40:40.472
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT
REVOLUTION WAS

40:40.507 --> 40:42.025
A REAL POSSIBILITY, YOU KNOW?

40:42.060 --> 40:44.649
THE SMELL OF BURNING CITIES
MADE THAT

40:44.683 --> 40:46.754
A SERIOUS PLAUSIBILITY,

40:46.789 --> 40:50.413
AND SO THIS WAS A DIFFERENT ERA.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.866
FROM NEW YORK CITY,

41:29.901 --> 41:32.697
WEARING BLACK TRUNKS

41:32.731 --> 41:36.563
THE CHALLENGER FLOYD PATTERSON.

41:38.806 --> 41:41.602
FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,

41:41.637 --> 41:44.536
WEARING WHITE TRUNKS,

41:44.571 --> 41:51.094
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD MUHAMMAD ALI.

41:53.856 --> 41:56.168
ROUND 1, 15 ROUNDS,

41:56.203 --> 41:59.171
WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP.

42:04.901 --> 42:08.008
NOW THE ROUND BEGINS.

42:17.742 --> 42:19.951
AT FIRST,
ALI JEERED HIS CHALLENGER

42:19.985 --> 42:23.782
AS HE DANCED PLAYFULLY AND THREW
SOFT, GLANCING PUNCHES.

42:23.817 --> 42:26.613
"COME ON, AMERICAN!"
ALI TAUNTED PATTERSON.

42:26.647 --> 42:29.547
"COME ON, WHITE AMERICAN!"

42:29.581 --> 42:32.860
WE THOUGHT THAT FLOYD
NEEDED TO BE TORTURED.

42:32.895 --> 42:36.036
HE NEEDED HIS COMEUPPANCE,
AND WHO BETTER THAN ALI

42:36.070 --> 42:38.245
TO GIVE IT TO HIM?

42:38.279 --> 42:41.006
IT INDICATED SOME
OF THE CRUELTY THAT WOULD LATER

42:41.041 --> 42:45.597
SURFACE IN ALI'S LIFE, YOU KNOW,

42:45.632 --> 42:47.806
BUT I THINK AS A BOXER,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE

42:47.841 --> 42:50.533
AN INHERENT SENSE
OF CRUELTY SOMEWHERE

42:50.568 --> 42:52.017
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
SUCCESSFUL, I THINK.

42:53.950 --> 42:56.781
AS THE FIGHT
ADVANCED, ALI ADDED HOOKS

42:56.815 --> 43:00.301
AND UPPERCUTS TO HIS ASSAULT,
WHILE PATTERSON

43:00.336 --> 43:03.650
STRUGGLED TO LAND
ANY BLOWS OF HIS OWN.

43:03.684 --> 43:06.204
I LOVED MUHAMMAD ALI.

43:06.238 --> 43:10.760
I DID NOT LIKE
EVERYTHING HE DID AND SAID.

43:10.795 --> 43:17.905
HE PUNCHED FLOYD JUST HARD
ENOUGH TO HURT HIM

43:17.940 --> 43:20.839
BUT NOT TO KNOCK HIM OUT.

43:20.874 --> 43:24.740
HE KEPT THE FIGHT GOING
ROUND AFTER ROUND,

43:24.774 --> 43:27.052
PUNISHING HIM.

43:27.087 --> 43:28.882
FLOYD PATTERSON REFUSED
TO CALL HIM

43:28.916 --> 43:32.195
BY HIS NEW RIGHTFUL NAME
MUHAMMAD ALI,

43:32.230 --> 43:36.614
UH, YOU KNOW, REFUSED TO
GIVE HIM ANY KIND OF RESPECT.

43:38.029 --> 43:41.204
FLOYD'S STILL IN THERE.

43:41.239 --> 43:44.725
DR. DONALD ROMEO IS IN
THE CORNER AT THE PRESENT TIME

43:44.760 --> 43:47.797
TALKING WITH FLOYD,
ASKING ABOUT HIS BACK.

43:47.832 --> 43:49.799
THAT'S THE DOCTOR ON THE OUTSIDE
OF THE RING.

43:49.834 --> 43:52.353
BEFORE ROUND 11,
A DOCTOR WAS ORDERED

43:52.388 --> 43:55.253
TO EXAMINE
THE CHALLENGER IN HIS CORNER.

43:55.287 --> 43:58.256
PATTERSON INSISTED
THAT THE MATCH GO ON.

44:00.672 --> 44:03.123
NUMBER 12 COMING UP.

44:15.066 --> 44:18.103
THIS MAN IS THROWING
A VARIETY OF SHOTS.

44:32.946 --> 44:34.706
BEAUTIFUL PUNCHES
BY CASSIUS CLAY,

44:34.741 --> 44:36.225
THE WORLD CHAMPION.

44:36.259 --> 44:38.054
BEAUTIFUL SHOTS ALL THE WAY.

44:38.089 --> 44:42.334
IT WAS CRUEL,
AND IT WAS HUMILIATING,

44:42.369 --> 44:45.717
AND I DON'T THINK THAT
ANYBODY REALLY DESERVED THAT,

44:45.752 --> 44:51.171
EVEN THOUGH, YOU KNOW,
FLOYD HAD BROUGHT IT ON HIMSELF.

44:51.205 --> 44:53.311
ANGELO DUNDEE,
TIRED OF WATCHING

44:53.345 --> 44:56.797
HIS FIGHTER TOY WITH PATTERSON,
SCREAMED, "KNOCK HIM OUT

44:56.832 --> 45:00.732
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!"

45:00.767 --> 45:02.078
HE'S WOBBLING.

45:02.113 --> 45:04.805
HE'S HURT.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.704
HE'S ON THE RECEIVING END
OF GOOD PUNCHES

45:06.738 --> 45:08.844
ALL THE WAY.

45:12.744 --> 45:15.333
WHAT A MARKSMAN.
A MINUTE TO GO IN NUMBER 12.

45:15.367 --> 45:20.200
WHAT A MARKSMAN CASSIUS CLAY IS.

45:20.234 --> 45:22.443
I BELIEVE THEY'RE
GOING TO STOP IT.

45:30.175 --> 45:33.040
SOMEBODY GET
A CHAIR DOWN THERE, PLEASE.

45:40.013 --> 45:43.879
I'M VERY, VERY SORRY BECAUSE

45:43.913 --> 45:46.329
OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT.

45:46.364 --> 45:50.782
I HAD HOPED THAT I COULD
GIVE ALL OF YOU,

45:50.817 --> 45:54.475
AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE ALL OVER
THE WORLD AND IN THE AUDIENCE,

45:54.510 --> 45:56.995
A MUCH BETTER FIGHT.

45:57.030 --> 45:59.239
NO, I COULDN'T KNOCK HIM OUT.WHY NOT?

45:59.273 --> 46:01.310
I TOOK MY BEST PUNCHES.
HE WOULDN'T FALL.

46:01.344 --> 46:02.483
SURPRISED ME.

46:02.518 --> 46:03.968
HE'S A GOOD FIGHTER,

46:04.002 --> 46:07.937
DETERMINED...GOOD FIGHTER.

46:07.972 --> 46:09.421
STRONG, SURPRISED ME.

46:09.456 --> 46:12.735
I GOT TWO SWOLLEN HANDS. SEE?

46:12.770 --> 46:14.357
WHO ARE
YOU FIGHTING NEXT?

46:14.392 --> 46:16.187
WHO DO YOU
WANT ME TO FIGHT?

46:16.221 --> 46:17.809
YOU PICK WHO
YOU WANT TO FIGHT.

46:17.844 --> 46:19.017
WHO DOES
THE PRESS WANT ME TO FIGHT?

46:19.052 --> 46:20.329
WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU SHOULD FIGHT?

46:20.363 --> 46:21.951
THE BEST MAN.WHO IS THE BEST MAN?

46:21.986 --> 46:25.058
WHO DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW. FIND HIM.

46:27.854 --> 46:31.754
ALI WAS IRREFUTABLY
IN A CLASS OF HIS OWN.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.929
"COMPARISONS
WITH HEAVYWEIGHTS OF THE PAST

46:33.963 --> 46:37.277
ARE HARDLY RELEVANT,"
WROTE ONE SPORTSWRITER.

46:37.311 --> 46:39.935
"PATTERSON HAD AS MUCH
CHANCE OF BEATING HIM

46:39.969 --> 46:45.250
AS THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS WOULD
HAVE HAD AGAINST A JET FIGHTER."

46:45.285 --> 46:46.769
YOU'RE PLANNING ON
FIGHTING THIS YEAR

46:46.804 --> 46:48.219
BEFORE THE YEAR
IS OUT?

46:48.253 --> 46:49.772
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I MIGHT RETIRE.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.084
I'M CONSIDERING RETIRING.

46:51.118 --> 46:52.464
I'M REALLY TIRED
OF FIGHTING.

46:52.499 --> 46:53.949
AT YOUR AGE?YEAH. I'M TIRED.

46:53.983 --> 46:55.847
I DON'T HAVE TO
FIGHT NO MORE.

46:55.882 --> 46:56.986
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL
RETIRE BEFORE YOU
HAVE ANOTHER FIGHT?

46:57.021 --> 46:58.436
I'M GETTING TOO GREAT.

46:58.470 --> 46:59.437
I CAN'T EVEN FLY PLANES
WITHOUT CROWDS

46:59.471 --> 47:01.266
WAITING FOR ME.

47:01.301 --> 47:03.268
DO YOU THINK YOU
MIGHT RETIRE WITHOUT
ANOTHER FIGHT?

47:03.303 --> 47:04.822
THAT'S RIGHT.
I DON'T LIKE BOXING.

47:04.856 --> 47:07.134
BOXING MEANS
NOTHING TO ME.

47:07.169 --> 47:10.448
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

47:10.482 --> 47:14.072
AH, WELL I LIKE JUST--
I LIKE WHAT ALL NEGROES LIKE,

47:14.107 --> 47:16.799
AND WHAT THEY'RE
FIGHTING FOR IS FREEDOM.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.318
IF YOU QUIT
FIGHTING, WOULD YOU GO

47:18.352 --> 47:21.252
FULL-TIME INTO
CIVIL RIGHTS WORK?

47:21.286 --> 47:24.496
NO, I DON'T KNOW IF
I CALL IT CIVIL RIGHTS.

47:24.531 --> 47:26.878
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
FOR AN OCCUPATION

47:26.913 --> 47:28.190
IF YOU STOP FIGHTING?

47:28.224 --> 47:29.501
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO.

47:29.536 --> 47:31.020
GOD'S GOT ME HERE
FOR SOMETHING.

47:31.055 --> 47:34.023
I CAN FEEL IT.

47:34.058 --> 47:37.371
I WAS BORN FOR EVERYTHING
THAT I'M DOING NOW.

47:43.584 --> 47:45.483
RIGHT AFTER THE SIGNING
OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT

47:45.517 --> 47:48.210
IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE WATTS RIOTS,

47:48.244 --> 47:51.523
AND THE WATTS RIOTS COME
TO SYMBOLIZE THE FACT

47:51.558 --> 47:54.595
THAT THINGS ARE FAR
FROM BEING SOLVED.

47:54.630 --> 47:58.599
THERE'S UNREST THAT
THESE BILLS WON'T REACH.

47:58.634 --> 48:03.018
IN THE URBAN NORTH,
WE WERE A LITTLE BIT ESTRANGED

48:03.052 --> 48:06.987
FROM THE STYLISTIC METHODS
OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT,

48:07.022 --> 48:09.231
WHICH WAS PRIMARILY
A SOUTHERN-BASED

48:09.265 --> 48:11.854
AND AGRARIAN-BASED
KIND OF THING.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.407
THEY WOULD HAVE OVERALLS ON.

48:13.442 --> 48:15.306
THEY WOULD BE SINGING HYMNS
AND APPEAL

48:15.340 --> 48:18.378
TO CLERGY-ORIENTED
KINDS OF THINGS.

48:18.412 --> 48:20.069
THIS WASN'T
OUR STYLE, YOU KNOW.

48:20.104 --> 48:21.588
WE WERE MORE SECULAR.

48:21.622 --> 48:24.315
WE DIDN'T WANT TO WEAR
OVERALLS, YOU KNOW?

48:24.349 --> 48:28.595
AND SO WE WANTED ANOTHER
FORM OF ACTIVISM,

48:28.629 --> 48:32.530
AND THE NATION OF ISLAM AND
AND MALCOLM X HAD ALREADY BEEN

48:32.564 --> 48:35.360
VERY INFLUENTIAL
IN THE URBAN NORTH,

48:35.395 --> 48:37.431
AND BLACK--UH, I THINK,
BLACK ACTIVISTS

48:37.466 --> 48:39.917
WERE MORE ATTRACTED TO THAT KIND
OF ACTIVISM

48:39.951 --> 48:42.885
THAN THEY WERE
TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MODE,

48:42.920 --> 48:46.924
AND SO MUHAMMAD ALI FIT
PERFECTLY WITH THAT MODEL.

48:48.408 --> 48:51.342
BY 1966,
MUHAMMAD ALI HAD BECOME

48:51.376 --> 48:55.518
THE HIGHEST-PAID ATHLETE
IN THE WORLD.

48:55.553 --> 48:58.280
EAGER TO CAPITALIZE
ON THAT SUCCESS,

48:58.314 --> 49:00.316
ALI AND HERBERT MUHAMMAD,

49:00.351 --> 49:02.491
ALONG WITH FOOTBALL STAR
JIM BROWN

49:02.525 --> 49:06.288
AND A FORMER PROSECUTOR
FROM QUEENS NAMED BOB ARUM,

49:06.322 --> 49:08.462
FORMED MAIN BOUT, INC.

49:08.497 --> 49:12.018
TO MANAGE SUPPLEMENTAL RIGHTS
TO ALL OF ALI'S FIGHTS,

49:12.052 --> 49:15.469
INCLUDING
CLOSED-CIRCUIT BROADCASTS.

49:15.504 --> 49:19.301
CLOSED-CIRCUIT WAS,
IN THE SIXTIES,

49:19.335 --> 49:23.305
THE EQUIVALENT
OF WHAT PAY-PER-VIEW IS TODAY.

49:23.339 --> 49:28.068
WE WERE LIMITED AT THE TIME
TO 350 LOCATIONS--

49:28.103 --> 49:31.416
THEATERS, ARENAS--
WHERE WE COULD SHOW

49:31.451 --> 49:34.557
THE TELECAST OF THE FIGHT.

49:34.592 --> 49:37.146
WHILE THERE HAD BEEN
CLOSED-CIRCUIT

49:37.181 --> 49:42.358
BEFORE MUHAMMAD ALI,
MUHAMMAD ALI PUT CLOSED-CIRCUIT

49:42.393 --> 49:44.912
INTO ANOTHER PLATEAU.

49:46.155 --> 49:48.192
THE LOUISVILLE
GROUP WAS NOT A PART

49:48.226 --> 49:49.987
OF THE NEW ENTERPRISE.

49:50.021 --> 49:53.128
ALI HAD TOLD HIS BACKERS
THAT HE INTENDED TO RENEW

49:53.162 --> 49:56.648
THEIR AGREEMENT
WHEN IT EXPIRED LATER THAT YEAR,

49:56.683 --> 50:00.031
BUT IT WAS CLEAR TO EVERYONE
THE NEAR-TOTAL INFLUENCE

50:00.066 --> 50:04.001
THE NATION OF ISLAM
HAD OVER THEIR BOXER.

50:04.035 --> 50:05.726
"WE HAD HOPED TO
BE COMPLETELY FREE

50:05.761 --> 50:09.040
OF UNDERWORLD CONNECTIONS,"
ONE MEMBER WROTE THE GROUP,

50:09.075 --> 50:12.423
"BUT WE SEEM TO HAVE
NEW ONES IN CHICAGO."

50:14.149 --> 50:16.013
ALI STILL LIKES THESE GUYS,
AND HE STILL

50:16.047 --> 50:18.670
REALLY TRUSTS THEM,
AND THEY'VE TREATED HIM WELL,

50:18.705 --> 50:21.501
AND HE CONTINUES TO SAY HE LOVES
AND SUPPORTS THESE GUYS,

50:21.535 --> 50:23.503
AND FOR A WHILE, HERBERT WORKS

50:23.537 --> 50:25.229
WITH THE LOUISVILLE
SPONSORING GROUP,

50:25.263 --> 50:27.162
BUT THAT BECOMES TOO
DIFFICULT AFTER A WHILE

50:27.196 --> 50:30.165
AND, EVENTUALLY,
THE LOUISVILLE SPONSORING GROUP

50:30.199 --> 50:33.340
GIVES UP, CUTS ITS TIES,
AND HERBERT BECOMES

50:33.375 --> 50:36.240
ALI'S FULL-TIME MANAGER.

50:46.526 --> 50:49.356
FIRST ONE, SET UP
A RING OF SECURITY.

50:51.738 --> 50:53.636
AFTER
THE UNITED STATES ESCALATED

50:53.671 --> 50:57.088
ITS INVOLVEMENT IN VIETNAM
BY COMMITTING COMBAT SOLDIERS

50:57.123 --> 51:02.507
IN 1965, THE DEMAND
FOR TROOPS INCREASED.

51:02.542 --> 51:05.476
THE SELECTIVE SERVICE
LOWERED ITS STANDARDS.

51:07.581 --> 51:11.171
MUHAMMAD ALI,
ONCE DISQUALIFIED, WAS NOW

51:11.206 --> 51:13.553
ELIGIBLE FOR THE DRAFT.

51:15.624 --> 51:22.182
I WAS IN MIAMI TO DO
SOME FEATURE STORY ABOUT HIM,

51:22.217 --> 51:26.635
AND HE COMES OUT,
AND HE IS STEAMING.

51:26.669 --> 51:32.503
HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT
HE HAD BEEN RECLASSIFIED 1-A.

51:32.537 --> 51:35.126
I JUST CAN'T
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD

51:35.161 --> 51:38.474
RECLASSIFY ME AS 1-A
WHEN THEY WERE THE ONES

51:38.509 --> 51:41.201
WHO SAID--THE GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS WERE THE ONES

51:41.236 --> 51:44.791
WHO SAID THAT I WAS 1-Y,
AND THAT I WASN'T QUALIFIED.

51:44.825 --> 51:46.517
IT WAS THEIR DECISION.

51:46.551 --> 51:49.347
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I'M 1-A WITHOUT ANY TEST,

51:49.382 --> 51:51.522
WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME
OR CHECKING TO SEE

51:51.556 --> 51:54.525
IF I'M ANY WISER THAN I WAS
THE LAST TIME OR ANY WORSER.

51:54.559 --> 51:55.733
IF YOU ARE
DRAFTED WILL YOU FIGHT

51:55.767 --> 51:57.355
FOR YOUR COUNTRY?

51:57.390 --> 51:59.081
I'M NOT SAYING NOTHING
ABOUT THINGS

51:59.116 --> 52:00.531
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO SAY.

52:00.565 --> 52:02.153
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY
NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

52:02.188 --> 52:04.190
UH, THEY HAVEN'T DRAFTED
ME YET,

52:04.224 --> 52:06.571
AND IT'S A TOUCHY THING,
A TOUCHY QUESTION,

52:06.606 --> 52:10.403
AND I RATHER NOT
SAY NOTHING.

52:10.437 --> 52:12.853
THE NEXT MORNING,
MUHAMMAD ALI OFFERED

52:12.888 --> 52:17.306
A MORE COHERENT ARGUMENT
AGAINST JOINING THE MILITARY.

52:17.341 --> 52:21.172
"I AM A MEMBER OF THE MUSLIMS,
AND WE DON'T GO TO WARS

52:21.207 --> 52:24.106
UNLESS THEY ARE
DECLARED BY ALLAH HIMSELF,"

52:24.141 --> 52:26.660
HE TOLD A REPORTER
FOR THE "CHICAGO DAILY NEWS."

52:26.695 --> 52:31.389
"I DON'T HAVE NO PERSONAL
QUARREL WITH THOSE VIET CONGS."

52:31.424 --> 52:34.841
"I AIN'T GOT NOTHIN'
AGAINST THEM VIET CONG,"

52:34.875 --> 52:37.878
AND IT WAS LIKE
THE WORLD STOPPED.

52:37.913 --> 52:41.365
THERE WAS A REAL FEELING THAT
HE WAS NOT

52:41.399 --> 52:45.300
THE RIGHT CHAMPION FOR AMERICA.

52:45.334 --> 52:50.650
HOW COULD A BOXER,
A VIOLENT MAN,

52:50.684 --> 52:54.481
REFUSE TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY?

52:54.516 --> 52:58.278
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WAS
JUST HOW DESPISED

52:58.313 --> 53:02.662
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS
THROUGHOUT AMERICA.

53:02.696 --> 53:05.216
PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT
THEY WERE PATRIOTS,

53:05.251 --> 53:10.670
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO WERE
SENDING THEIR SONS TO WAR,

53:10.704 --> 53:14.329
WHO HAD FOUGHT THEMSELVES
IN WORLD WAR II AND KOREA,

53:14.363 --> 53:16.572
WHICH WAS NOT THAT FAR BACK,

53:16.607 --> 53:20.887
REALLY SAW
THIS REPREHENSIBLE CHARACTER

53:20.921 --> 53:23.372
WHO WAS,
YOU KNOW, MAKING MILLIONS,

53:23.407 --> 53:25.754
TAKING EVERYTHING FROM AMERICA,

53:25.788 --> 53:29.378
AND GIVING NOTHING BACK.

53:29.413 --> 53:32.623
IN 1966,
AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY

53:32.657 --> 53:36.937
OF AMERICAN CITIZENS
SUPPORTED THE VIETNAM WAR.

53:36.972 --> 53:39.423
JIM MURRAY
OF THE "LOS ANGELES TIMES"

53:39.457 --> 53:41.908
CALLED ALI "THE GREATEST
AMERICAN PATRIOT

53:41.942 --> 53:44.255
SINCE BENEDICT ARNOLD."

53:44.290 --> 53:47.396
"GO TO SOME MOTHER
IN IOWA," MURRAY URGED ALI,

53:47.431 --> 53:50.641
AND "SUGGEST SHE SEND
HER SON INSTEAD."

53:50.675 --> 53:52.712
ANOTHER WRITER CALLED HIM
THE WORST INFLUENCE

53:52.746 --> 53:56.681
ON PEOPLE SINCE ADOLF HITLER.

53:56.716 --> 53:59.546
LATER THAT MONTH,
MUHAMMAD ALI APPLIED

53:59.581 --> 54:02.308
FOR CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR
STATUS BASED

54:02.342 --> 54:04.724
ON HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

54:04.758 --> 54:06.760
HE WAS EMULATING
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

54:06.795 --> 54:10.592
WHO HAD REFUSED TO ENTER
THE SERVICE HIMSELF

54:10.626 --> 54:12.490
IN THE FORTIES.

54:12.525 --> 54:15.286
HE WAS FOLLOWING THE DICTATES
OF THE NATION OF ISLAM,

54:15.321 --> 54:19.773
AND THAT DEFINITELY
DIMINISHED HIS POPULARITY

54:19.808 --> 54:22.638
IN AMERICA IN GENERAL

54:22.673 --> 54:24.847
AND NOT JUST
IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY.

54:24.882 --> 54:26.435
THERE WERE A LOT
OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS,

54:26.470 --> 54:28.299
A LOT OF BLACK PEOPLE
WHO THOUGHT

54:28.334 --> 54:31.544
THAT HE WAS INSUFFICIENTLY LOYAL

54:31.578 --> 54:34.754
AND INAPPRECIATIVE
OF THE OPPORTUNITIES HE'S HAD

54:34.788 --> 54:36.928
AS AN AMERICAN,
AND HE SHOULD SHOW

54:36.963 --> 54:41.761
HIS DEDICATION TO THE COUNTRY
AND BE WILLING TO FIGHT.

54:44.764 --> 54:46.904
ALI'S NEXT FIGHT
HAD BEEN SCHEDULED

54:46.938 --> 54:50.425
FOR MARCH 29, 1966, IN CHICAGO

54:50.459 --> 54:52.944
AGAINST THE 6'6" ERNIE TERRELL,

54:52.979 --> 54:54.498
THE BOXER WHO HAD BEEN AWARDED

54:54.532 --> 54:56.534
THE WORLD BOXING ASSOCIATION
TITLE

54:56.569 --> 54:59.468
AFTER THEY HAD STRIPPED IT
FROM ALI.

55:00.573 --> 55:03.507
MOST BOXING FANS STILL
VIEWED ALI

55:03.541 --> 55:07.407
AS THE REAL CHAMP,
AND A DEFEAT OF TERRELL

55:07.442 --> 55:09.858
WOULD CEMENT HIS CLAIM.

55:09.892 --> 55:12.378
"I WANT OUR SOLDIERS
AND MARINES TO SEE

55:12.412 --> 55:15.346
WHAT A REAL CHAMPION LOOKS
LIKE," SAID TERRELL,

55:15.381 --> 55:17.452
WHO PROMISED TO SIGN UP
FOR AN EXHIBITION TOUR

55:17.486 --> 55:21.456
IN VIETNAM AFTER DEFEATING ALI.

55:21.490 --> 55:23.527
AND WE ANNOUNCED
THE FIGHT,

55:23.561 --> 55:25.874
AND TICKETS WERE GOING
VERY WELL,

55:25.908 --> 55:28.946
AND WE WERE SECURING
CLOSED-CIRCUIT EXHIBITORS

55:28.980 --> 55:30.879
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

55:30.913 --> 55:35.815
I HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE
THE BIGGEST ALI PROMOTION EVER

55:35.849 --> 55:37.782
AT THAT POINT.

55:37.817 --> 55:41.510
WHEN ALI, SAID, "I GOT
NOTHING AGAINST THE VIET CONG,"

55:41.545 --> 55:44.030
MAYOR DALEY
IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED

55:44.064 --> 55:47.620
THE ILLINOIS ATHLETIC COMMISSION
AND TOLD THEM TO

55:47.654 --> 55:50.416
THROW US OUT OF CHICAGO.

55:50.450 --> 55:52.866
TO SALVAGE THE FIGHT,
ALI BACKED AWAY

55:52.901 --> 55:55.041
FROM HIS STATEMENTS
AND OFFERED TO COME

55:55.075 --> 55:57.699
BEFORE THE ILLINOIS STATE
ATHLETIC COMMISSION

55:57.733 --> 55:59.494
TO APOLOGIZE,

55:59.528 --> 56:01.496
BUT AFTER HAVING BREAKFAST
WITH ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

56:01.530 --> 56:05.741
BEFORE THE HEARING,
HE REVERSED COURSE.

56:05.776 --> 56:08.295
I'M ASKING YOU IF YOU APOLOGIZE

56:08.330 --> 56:10.919
FOR THE UNPATRIOTIC
REMARKS THAT YOU MADE.

56:10.953 --> 56:12.645
ANYTHING--I'M NOT
APOLOGIZING FOR NOTHING

56:12.679 --> 56:14.440
LIKE THAT BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE TO.

56:14.474 --> 56:17.546
I'M APOLOGIZING TO
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

56:17.581 --> 56:19.410
IN CHARGE OF
THE SELECTIVE SERVICE.

56:19.445 --> 56:20.998
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT
WE'LL TAKE THIS UP WITH THEM.

56:21.032 --> 56:22.827
I'M NOT IN COURT
NOW FOR THAT.

56:22.862 --> 56:25.451
I'M A CHAMP OF THE WORLD,
THIS IS ATHLETIC COMMISSIONER,

56:25.485 --> 56:27.314
AND I'M HERE
TO FIGHT FOR THE TITLE,

56:27.349 --> 56:29.420
AND I'M JUST APOLOGIZING
FOR WHAT I SAID

56:29.455 --> 56:31.767
TO THE NEWSPAPERS
AND TO THE PRESS

56:31.802 --> 56:33.942
WHEN I SHOULD'VE HAD
THESE THINGS TO SAY,

56:33.976 --> 56:35.530
AND THEY WILL
FROM NOW ON BE SAID

56:35.564 --> 56:39.050
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
IN CHARGE OF THIS.

56:39.085 --> 56:40.431
MR. CLAY, WHEN YOU--

56:40.466 --> 56:41.812
MUHAMMAD ALI, SIR.

56:41.846 --> 56:42.916
MR. CLAY--

56:42.951 --> 56:44.435
MUHAMMAD ALI, SIR.

56:44.470 --> 56:45.609
OR MR. MUHAMMAD ALI,
EITHER ONE.

56:45.643 --> 56:47.369
I'M JUST
MUHAMMAD ALI, SIR.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.820
WHEN YOU APPEARED BEFORE
THIS COMMISSION BEFORE,

56:49.854 --> 56:51.649
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY,
YOU SAID

56:51.684 --> 56:53.927
YOU WERE
THE PEOPLE'S CHAMPION.

56:53.962 --> 56:55.515
YES, SIR.

56:55.550 --> 56:56.689
DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE ACTING LIKE

56:56.723 --> 56:57.966
A PEOPLE'S CHAMPION?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.002
YES, SIR.

57:06.595 --> 57:09.046
IS THE FIGHT ON OR OFF?
IS THE FIGHT ON OUR OFF?

57:09.080 --> 57:12.429
THAT SAME DAY,
THE ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL

57:12.463 --> 57:15.397
DECLARED THE FIGHT ILLEGAL.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.468
WE DETERMINED THAT
THE APPLICATION

57:17.503 --> 57:19.953
AND THE LICENSE
VIOLATED STATE LAW.

57:19.988 --> 57:23.025
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
STATEMENTS CLAY MADE.

57:23.060 --> 57:24.924
THE ONLY THING I CAN FIGURE
OUT ABOUT CLAY IS HE'S

57:24.958 --> 57:26.857
GUILTY OF BEING STUPID.

57:26.891 --> 57:30.930
AND ONCE WE GOT OUT
OF CHICAGO, EVERY CITY

57:30.964 --> 57:34.727
IN THE UNITED STATES
VIRTUALLY DID A PILE-ON,

57:34.761 --> 57:39.490
AND THE PILE-ON WAS, "KALAMAZOO
WILL NOT ACCEPT THE FIGHT!"

57:39.525 --> 57:42.597
YOU KNOW, NOBODY ASKED THEM,
SO IT BECAME OBVIOUS TO ME

57:42.631 --> 57:46.911
THAT WE COULDN'T DO THE FIGHT
IN THE UNITED STATES.

57:46.946 --> 57:49.396
ARUM EVENTUALLY
FOUND A VENUE FOR THE FIGHT

57:49.431 --> 57:51.019
IN TORONTO, CANADA,

57:51.053 --> 57:53.987
BUT TERRELL REJECTED
THE TERMS OF THE NEW CONTRACT

57:54.022 --> 57:56.058
AND PULLED OUT.

57:56.093 --> 57:59.061
WITH LESS THAN 3 WEEKS TO GO,
PROMOTERS SCRAMBLED

57:59.096 --> 58:02.513
TO FIND ANOTHER OPPONENT.

58:02.548 --> 58:05.551
GEORGE CHUVALO, THE CANADIAN
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION,

58:05.585 --> 58:08.174
AGREED TO TAKE TERRELL'S PLACE.

58:08.208 --> 58:10.521
HE'S GONNA FIGHT
GEORGE CHUVALO IN TORONTO

58:10.556 --> 58:13.869
BECAUSE THAT PATRIOTIC
MAYOR DALEY OF CHICAGO

58:13.904 --> 58:15.975
HAD SAID HE CAN'T ABIDE
A TRAITOR'S

58:16.009 --> 58:17.735
FIGHTING IN HIS MIDST.

58:17.770 --> 58:22.188
SO I GO UP THERE,
AND I COME TO SULLY'S AC GYM.

58:22.222 --> 58:23.810
I GO IN THE BACK.

58:23.845 --> 58:25.467
AND LUIS SARRIA,
THE CUBAN EXILE,

58:25.502 --> 58:27.607
IS GIVING HIM A MASSAGE.

58:27.642 --> 58:29.436
HE SAID, "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?"

58:29.471 --> 58:31.162
I SAID, "WELL, SOMEBODY
SAID THERE'S A FIGHT."

58:31.197 --> 58:33.751
HE SAID, "NO, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS NOT MUCH OF A FIGHT."

58:33.786 --> 58:35.477
I SAID, "WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

58:35.512 --> 58:37.997
"MUHAMMAD, I'M NOT
GONNA LIE TO YOU.

58:38.031 --> 58:41.621
"A LOT OF YOUNG AMERICAN MEN
WHO DO NOT WANT TO FIGHT

58:41.656 --> 58:46.730
"IN THIS WAR FOR REASONS
OF CONSCIENCE OR RELIGION

58:46.764 --> 58:49.008
"OR WHATEVER ELSE ARE COMING
TO CANADA,

58:49.042 --> 58:52.218
"AND THEY'VE BEEN GRANTED
POLITICAL ASYLUM,

58:52.252 --> 58:54.807
SO I'M HERE TO SEE
IF YOU GO HOME."

58:54.841 --> 58:56.912
HE GOT OFF THAT THING
SO FAST AND GOT IN MY FACE,

58:56.947 --> 58:58.569
I THOUGHT HE WAS
GONNA HIT ME.

58:58.604 --> 59:00.053
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT."

59:00.088 --> 59:02.055
HE SAID, "LOOK"--AND THESE
ARE THE WORDS.

59:02.090 --> 59:03.678
I REMEMBER THEM SO WELL.

59:03.712 --> 59:05.990
"AMERICA IS MY BIRTH COUNTRY.

59:06.025 --> 59:08.786
"NO ONE'S GONNA CHASE ME
OUT OF MY BIRTH COUNTRY.

59:08.821 --> 59:11.030
"I BELONG
IN MY BIRTH COUNTRY.

59:11.064 --> 59:14.205
"NOW I DON'T MAKE
THE LAWS IN MY BIRTH COUNTRY.

59:14.240 --> 59:15.966
"SO IF THE LAW SAYS
I GOT TO GO TO JAIL,

59:16.000 --> 59:17.208
"I'LL GO TO JAIL.

59:17.243 --> 59:19.141
"ELIJAH DID.
I WILL DO IT,

59:19.176 --> 59:20.798
"BUT I'M GOING HOME
TO MY BIRTH COUNTRY,

59:20.833 --> 59:23.076
AND YOU COULD TELL THAT
TO EVERYBODY."

59:23.111 --> 59:25.734
I WAS POSITIVE HE'D GO
TO JAIL IF HE HAD TO.

59:27.633 --> 59:31.084
GEORGE CHUVALO
LASTED ALL 15 ROUNDS,

59:31.119 --> 59:34.640
GIVING ALI WHAT HE CALLED
HIS "TOUGHEST FIGHT YET."

59:36.020 --> 59:39.506
SINCE DEFEATING LISTON,
ALI HAD DEFENDED HIS TITLE

59:39.541 --> 59:43.234
ONLY 3 TIMES IN 2 YEARS,
BUT NOW,

59:43.269 --> 59:46.824
BROKE AND BEHIND
ON ALIMONY PAYMENTS TO SONJI,

59:46.859 --> 59:50.725
ALI FOUGHT 6 TIMES
OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

59:53.693 --> 59:56.869
WE WENT TO ENGLAND
TO FIGHT HENRY COOPER AGAIN.

59:56.903 --> 59:59.872
WE GOT UP AROUND NOON.

59:59.906 --> 1:00:02.046
THE HOTEL WAS
IN PICCADILLY CIRCUS.

1:00:02.081 --> 1:00:06.292
CAME OUTSIDE,
AND THERE WERE 5,000 PEOPLE

1:00:06.326 --> 1:00:09.571
CHANTING HIS NAME,

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:13.299
AND YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT
A TONIC THAT WAS--

1:00:13.333 --> 1:00:18.269
BECAUSE HE WAS SO UNPOPULAR
IN THE UNITED STATES--

1:00:18.304 --> 1:00:23.965
TO GO OVER TO ENGLAND
AND TO BE GREETED BY THE PEOPLE

1:00:23.999 --> 1:00:28.659
IN LONDON WITH THAT TYPE
OF ADMIRATION.

1:00:28.694 --> 1:00:31.558
I MEAN, THAT REALLY PRESAGED

1:00:31.593 --> 1:00:35.735
THE WAY HE WOULD BE LOVED
YEARS LATER.

1:00:42.121 --> 1:00:43.743
YES, HENRY COOPER'S LEFT EYE

1:00:43.778 --> 1:00:45.262
IS BADLY CUT.

1:00:45.296 --> 1:00:47.678
A REALLY BAD ONE,
WHICH IS A RIGHT-HAND CLIP THERE

1:00:47.713 --> 1:00:49.784
IN THE FAR CORNER.

1:00:53.132 --> 1:00:55.168
NO. IT'S ALL OVER.

1:00:55.203 --> 1:00:56.998
ALI DEFEATED
HENRY COOPER

1:00:57.032 --> 1:00:58.689
BY TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT

1:00:58.724 --> 1:01:01.140
JUST AS HE HAD
IN THEIR PREVIOUS MATCH

1:01:01.174 --> 1:01:03.729
AND WENT ON TO BEAT
TWO MORE MEDIOCRE OPPONENTS

1:01:03.763 --> 1:01:05.627
IN EUROPE.

1:01:13.704 --> 1:01:16.776
BETWEEN FIGHTS,
ALI HAD RETURNED TO LOUISVILLE

1:01:16.811 --> 1:01:18.260
FOR A HEARING ON HIS APPLICATION

1:01:18.295 --> 1:01:20.953
FOR CONSCIENTIOUS
OBJECTOR STATUS.

1:01:20.987 --> 1:01:24.957
ALI WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT HE
WAS OPPOSED TO ALL WARS,

1:01:24.991 --> 1:01:28.029
THAT HIS OPPOSITION
WAS BASED ON RELIGIOUS BELIEFS,

1:01:28.063 --> 1:01:31.929
AND THAT HE WAS SINCERE
IN HOLDING THOSE BELIEFS.

1:01:31.964 --> 1:01:35.243
THE FBI HAD INTERVIEWED
HIS FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS,

1:01:35.277 --> 1:01:37.866
MANY OF WHOM QUESTIONED
HIS JUDGMENT FOR JOINING

1:01:37.901 --> 1:01:42.353
THE NATION OF ISLAM
BUT NOT HIS SINCERITY.

1:01:42.388 --> 1:01:44.217
THE HEARING EXAMINER,
WHO WAS A RETIRED

1:01:44.252 --> 1:01:47.255
KENTUCKY CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE,
CONCLUDED THAT ALI WAS

1:01:47.289 --> 1:01:50.223
INDEED ENTITLED TO
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR STATUS

1:01:50.258 --> 1:01:53.261
AND RECOMMENDED
THAT HE BE GIVEN A C.O.

1:01:53.295 --> 1:01:55.642
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,
NOTWITHSTANDING

1:01:55.677 --> 1:01:59.370
THAT RECOMMENDATION, SENT A LONG
LETTER TO THE DRAFT BOARD,

1:01:59.405 --> 1:02:03.754
UM, ARGUING THAT ALI SHOULD
NOT BE GIVEN

1:02:03.789 --> 1:02:06.964
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR
STATUS.

1:02:06.999 --> 1:02:08.759
THE KENTUCKY APPEAL BOARD
COULD HAVE REJECTED

1:02:08.794 --> 1:02:10.278
THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE LETTER,

1:02:10.312 --> 1:02:11.935
BUT IT DIDN'T.

1:02:11.969 --> 1:02:14.765
IT CONTINUED TO DENY
HIS C.O. APPLICATION

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:16.974
AND DIDN'T GIVE ANY REASONS WHY.

1:02:17.009 --> 1:02:20.081
IT JUST SAID, "NO.
YOU'RE STILL 1-A,"

1:02:20.115 --> 1:02:23.774
AND AS THE CASE UNFOLDED,
IT BECAME IMPORTANT

1:02:23.809 --> 1:02:26.673
THAT THE KENTUCKY APPEAL BOARD
HADN'T EXPLAINED

1:02:26.708 --> 1:02:29.711
WHY IT DID WHAT IT DID.

1:02:29.746 --> 1:02:32.438
THE DECISION MEANT
THAT THE ARMY COULD DRAFT

1:02:32.472 --> 1:02:35.199
MUHAMMAD ALI AT ANY TIME.

1:02:37.098 --> 1:02:40.308
AFTER 4 FIGHTS ABROAD,
ALI'S PROMOTERS

1:02:40.342 --> 1:02:43.449
HAD FINALLY MANAGED TO SECURE
AN AMERICAN VENUE,

1:02:43.483 --> 1:02:46.348
THE ASTRODOME IN HOUSTON, TEXAS,

1:02:46.383 --> 1:02:48.730
A BRAND-NEW
AND FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:54.115
DOMED STADIUM DUBBED
THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD.

1:02:54.149 --> 1:02:57.463
ALI HAD AGREED TO FIGHT
CLEVELAND "BIG CAT" WILLIAMS,

1:02:57.497 --> 1:02:59.983
AN ARMY VETERAN
WHO'D ONCE BEEN SHOT

1:03:00.017 --> 1:03:03.469
BY A POLICE OFFICER
DURING A DRUNK DRIVING ARREST.

1:03:03.503 --> 1:03:08.957
WILLIAMS HAD KNOCKED OUT
51 OF HIS 71 OPPONENTS.

1:03:08.992 --> 1:03:10.787
IT WOULD BE THE LARGEST AUDIENCE

1:03:10.821 --> 1:03:13.755
FOR AN INDOOR BOXING MATCH
IN HISTORY.

1:03:17.897 --> 1:03:20.072
I THINK HIS MASTERPIECE

1:03:20.106 --> 1:03:22.833
IS WITH CLEVELAND WILLIAMS.

1:03:22.868 --> 1:03:24.835
THAT'S PICASSO, RIGHT?

1:03:24.870 --> 1:03:26.872
THAT'S BARYSHNIKOV, RIGHT?

1:03:26.906 --> 1:03:29.806
THAT'S MILES DAVIS.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:32.015
HE THROWS, LIKE,
A 10-PUNCH COMBINATION.

1:03:32.049 --> 1:03:34.811
HE'S GOING BACKWARDS, MAN.

1:03:34.845 --> 1:03:38.159
NOW LOOK. HA HA! LOOK.

1:03:38.193 --> 1:03:41.300
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEFINE THAT.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST,

1:03:41.334 --> 1:03:43.923
BUT, LIKE, THAT, THAT KIND
OF LIKE, YOU KNOW, ARTISTRY

1:03:43.958 --> 1:03:46.857
WILL NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN.

1:03:46.892 --> 1:03:52.380
WHEN HE DID THAT,
UM, IT LOOKED EFFORTLESS,

1:03:52.414 --> 1:03:56.418
AND, UH, IT LOOKED LIKE, UM...

1:03:56.453 --> 1:03:58.835
HE CAME OUT OF THE WOMB
DOING THAT.

1:04:01.838 --> 1:04:03.909
INTRODUCING
A NEW MOVE HE'D DUBBED

1:04:03.943 --> 1:04:07.913
THE "ALI SHUFFLE," HE PEPPERED
WILLIAMS WITH JAB AFTER JAB

1:04:07.947 --> 1:04:12.158
AS THE "BIG CAT" STRUGGLED
TO LAND A SINGLE PUNCH.

1:04:12.193 --> 1:04:14.298
ALI FLOORED HIS CHALLENGER
3 TIMES

1:04:14.333 --> 1:04:16.369
IN THE SECOND ROUND.

1:04:16.404 --> 1:04:19.303
IT WAS "A TWO-FISTED ASSAULT
OF VICIOUS EFFECTIVENESS,"

1:04:19.338 --> 1:04:21.512
WROTE FREQUENT CRITIC
ARTHUR DALEY,

1:04:21.547 --> 1:04:27.001
WHO DECLARED THAT ALI HAD
"WON OVER ALL THE DOUBTERS."

1:04:27.035 --> 1:04:29.486
A MINUTE INTO THE THIRD ROUND,

1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:32.075
THE REFEREE ENDED THE FIGHT.

1:04:35.216 --> 1:04:38.288
THE CHAMPION
CASSIUS CLAY WILL DEFEND

1:04:38.322 --> 1:04:41.325
THAT TITLE ONCE AGAIN,

1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:43.983
AND TONIGHT HE SUCCESSFULLY
DEFENDED IT

1:04:44.018 --> 1:04:48.815
AGAINST THE MAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE HARDEST HITTER.

1:04:48.850 --> 1:04:53.337
I INTENDED TO TAKE
A REST AFTER THE HARD, UH,

1:04:53.372 --> 1:04:58.515
6 TITLE FIGHTS I JUST HAD,
AT LEAST 6 MONTHS' REST,

1:04:58.549 --> 1:05:01.242
BUT I JUST COULDN'T REST
AT NIGHT STAYING HOME SLEEPING

1:05:01.276 --> 1:05:06.040
AND THINKING ABOUT TERRELL
CLAIMING HALF OF THE TITLE.

1:05:06.074 --> 1:05:08.076
ALL OF IT.ALL OF IT.

1:05:09.629 --> 1:05:12.184
I SAY THAT'LL MAKE IT WORSER.

1:05:12.218 --> 1:05:15.187
CLAIMING ALL THE TITLE,
AND EVERYWHERE I GO SINCERELY

1:05:15.221 --> 1:05:18.052
THROUGHOUT THE STREETS
OF AMERICA, NORTH AND SOUTH,

1:05:18.086 --> 1:05:20.261
BLACK AND WHITE, AS FAR
AS RACE IS CONCERNED,

1:05:20.295 --> 1:05:22.125
OLD AND YOUNG,
WOMEN AND MEN,

1:05:22.159 --> 1:05:24.265
EVERYBODY'S TALKING
ABOUT IT.

1:05:24.299 --> 1:05:26.025
"WHAT ABOUT ERNIE TERRELL?"

1:05:26.060 --> 1:05:27.613
"WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO FIGHT TERRELL?

1:05:27.647 --> 1:05:29.546
"WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO FIGHT TERRELL?"

1:05:29.580 --> 1:05:33.412
IN DECEMBER, ALI
AND ERNIE TERRELL APPEARED

1:05:33.446 --> 1:05:36.173
ON ABC's "WIDE WORLD
OF SPORTS" TO PROMOTE

1:05:36.208 --> 1:05:40.350
THEIR BOUT, SCHEDULED
FOR FEBRUARY 6, 1967,

1:05:40.384 --> 1:05:41.972
AT THE ASTRODOME.

1:05:42.007 --> 1:05:44.147
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME
BY MY NAME, MAN?

1:05:44.181 --> 1:05:46.183
WELL, WHAT'S
YOUR NAME?

1:05:46.218 --> 1:05:47.978
YOU TOLD ME YOUR NAME
WAS CASSIUS CLAY
A FEW YEARS AGO.

1:05:48.013 --> 1:05:49.911
I NEVER TOLD YOU
MY NAME WAS CASSIUS CLAY.

1:05:49.946 --> 1:05:51.568
WELL...MY NAME IS
MUHAMMAD ALI,

1:05:51.602 --> 1:05:53.363
AND YOU WILL ANNOUNCE
IT RIGHT THERE

1:05:53.397 --> 1:05:55.468
IN THE CENTER OF THAT RING
AFTER THE FIGHT

1:05:55.503 --> 1:05:57.160
IF YOU DON'T DO IT NOW.

1:05:57.194 --> 1:05:58.609
FOR THE BENEFIT
OF THIS BROADCAST,

1:05:58.644 --> 1:06:00.957
HIM, ALL RIGHT? UH...

1:06:00.991 --> 1:06:04.201
YOU ACTING JUST LIKE
A OLD UNCLE TOM,

1:06:04.236 --> 1:06:06.203
ANOTHER
FLOYD PATTERSON.

1:06:06.238 --> 1:06:07.653
I'M GONNA PUNISH YOU...LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MAN.

1:06:07.687 --> 1:06:09.103
YOU AIN'T GOT NO
BUSINESS CALLING ME NO--

1:06:09.137 --> 1:06:10.449
BACK OFF OF ME,
BACK OFF OF ME.

1:06:10.483 --> 1:06:11.898
DON'T CALL ME
NO UNCLE TOM, MAN.

1:06:11.933 --> 1:06:13.245
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.
AN UNCLE TOM.

1:06:13.279 --> 1:06:15.040
WHY YOU GONNA CALL
ME A UNCLE TOM?

1:06:15.074 --> 1:06:16.662
I DIDN'T DO
NOTHING TO YOU...YOU HEARD ME.

1:06:16.696 --> 1:06:18.319
FOR YOU TO CALL ME
NO UNCLE TOM.JUST BACK OFF OF ME!

1:06:18.353 --> 1:06:20.183
AND SO LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN...UNCLE TOM!

1:06:20.217 --> 1:06:23.013
AS THE TWO CONTESTANTS PREPARE
FOR BATTLE RIGHT NOW--

1:06:23.048 --> 1:06:26.189
BACK OFF OF ME, MAN.
BACK OFF OF ME, MAN!

1:06:26.223 --> 1:06:27.604
ANOTHER INTERVIEW
HAS BEEN RECORDED

1:06:27.638 --> 1:06:29.157
FOR POSTERITY...

1:06:29.192 --> 1:06:30.262
"I WANT TO
TORTURE HIM,"

1:06:30.296 --> 1:06:31.988
ALI SAID BEFORE THE FIGHT.

1:06:32.022 --> 1:06:33.990
"I WANT TO GIVE HIM
THE PATTERSON HUMILIATION

1:06:34.024 --> 1:06:36.061
AND PUNISH HIM."

1:06:36.095 --> 1:06:37.476
PERFECT,
THAT'S IT.

1:06:39.098 --> 1:06:42.170
COME ON, MAN.WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

1:06:42.205 --> 1:06:44.690
COME ON, COME.KEEP SHOOTING.

1:06:48.383 --> 1:06:51.007
THE BELL FOR ROUND ONE.

1:06:54.631 --> 1:06:59.015
THIS GUY WANTED
TO CRUCIFY THIS "UNCLE TOM."

1:07:00.706 --> 1:07:05.607
HE WOULD THROW A JAB
AND TWIST IT.

1:07:05.642 --> 1:07:07.644
IT'S DAMAGING.

1:07:07.678 --> 1:07:09.266
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME
THREW A JAB,

1:07:09.301 --> 1:07:11.199
HE'S, LIKE, SAYING, "FUCK YOU."

1:07:14.685 --> 1:07:18.413
I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER
SEEN MUHAMMAD DISPLAY

1:07:18.448 --> 1:07:22.728
THAT KIND OF CONTEMPT
FOR SOMEBODY.

1:07:22.762 --> 1:07:24.661
MUHAMMAD ALI NOW
AT HIS MOST TAUNTING.

1:07:24.695 --> 1:07:27.491
GOT HIM WITH A RIGHT HAND
AT THE END OF THAT FLURRY.

1:07:27.526 --> 1:07:29.562
SOME SOUTHPAW IN HIM.

1:07:29.597 --> 1:07:31.323
REALLY TRYING TO
PERPLEX AND WORRY

1:07:31.357 --> 1:07:34.360
AND TORMENT TERRELL.

1:07:34.395 --> 1:07:36.224
AT THAT POINT
IN MUHAMMAD'S LIFE,

1:07:36.259 --> 1:07:40.539
HIM NOT BEING CALLED
MUHAMMAD ALI FROM A BLACK MAN,

1:07:40.573 --> 1:07:43.611
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH UNCLE TOMS?

1:07:43.645 --> 1:07:46.338
WE'RE GONNA PUBLICLY
HUMILIATE YOU,

1:07:46.372 --> 1:07:48.443
AND THAT'S WHAT MUHAMMAD DID.

1:07:50.652 --> 1:07:54.139
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
YOU'RE GONNA RESPECT ME.

1:07:57.245 --> 1:08:00.214
WHAT'S MY NAME?

1:08:00.248 --> 1:08:03.113
AND NOW ALI
TELLING TERRELL TO FIGHT,

1:08:03.148 --> 1:08:05.460
"COME ON, FIGHT"
HE SAYS, OPEN UP.

1:08:07.738 --> 1:08:13.572
THIS IS WHEN MUHAMMAD ALI IS
AT HIS LEAST SPORTSMAN-LIKE.

1:08:13.606 --> 1:08:15.574
THIS IS HIS TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A MAN HE KNOWS

1:08:15.608 --> 1:08:18.335
HE'S GOT WHIPPED I THINK.

1:08:18.370 --> 1:08:21.269
"COME ON, TERRELL" HE
SAYS, "FIGHT, FIGHT."

1:08:23.823 --> 1:08:25.446
HEY!

1:08:31.383 --> 1:08:33.385
WHAT'S MY NAME?

1:08:33.419 --> 1:08:34.765
"WHAT'S MY NAME?"

1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:36.733
HE'S ASKING HIM
"WHAT'S MY NAME?"

1:08:36.767 --> 1:08:40.150
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT.

1:08:44.327 --> 1:08:46.294
WHAT'S MY NAME HUH?

1:08:46.329 --> 1:08:49.159
WHAT'S MY NAME?
WHAT'S MY NAME?

1:08:49.194 --> 1:08:50.781
TERRELL GOES FOR HIM.

1:08:50.816 --> 1:08:55.786
OH, DEAR.
THIS IS NOT SPORT,

1:08:55.821 --> 1:08:58.237
BUT THIS IS MUHAMMAD ALI
NOW DOING JUST

1:08:58.272 --> 1:09:00.101
WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD DO,

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:02.448
AND THE CORNER--THE TERRELL
CORNER NOW HAVING TO WORK

1:09:02.483 --> 1:09:05.486
DESPERATELY, FURIOUSLY
FAST TO STAUNCH THE FLOW

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:07.315
OF BLOOD FROM THE RIGHT EYE.

1:09:07.350 --> 1:09:09.421
LOOKS LIKE A BAD CUT TO ME,
RIGHT UP OVER THE EYE

1:09:09.455 --> 1:09:11.492
JUST UNDER THE EYEBROW.

1:09:11.526 --> 1:09:13.632
ROUND 9.

1:09:13.666 --> 1:09:15.806
AND THERE HE GOES AGAIN.

1:09:24.401 --> 1:09:26.714
THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST
ASTONISHING SCENES

1:09:26.748 --> 1:09:28.302
THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN
IN A WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT

1:09:28.336 --> 1:09:30.511
CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT.

1:09:37.587 --> 1:09:39.485
THE CHANCES HE TAKES.

1:09:55.501 --> 1:09:58.228
I WAS THRILLED THAT HE
HE WAS--HE BEAT UP TERRELL

1:09:58.263 --> 1:10:00.161
AND SAID, "WHAT'S MY NAME?
WHAT'S MY NAME?"

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:04.130
I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT WAS
A SIGN THAT A NEW KIND

1:10:04.165 --> 1:10:06.788
OF BLACK ATHLETE HAD APPEARED,

1:10:06.823 --> 1:10:09.446
A WHOLE NEW KIND OF BLACK
CONSCIOUSNESS HAD APPEARED.

1:10:09.481 --> 1:10:11.414
IT WAS A WHOLE NEW KIND
OF BLACK MALE DISPENSATION

1:10:11.448 --> 1:10:14.140
THAT HAD COME ABOUT
AS A RESULT OF THAT FIGHT,

1:10:14.175 --> 1:10:16.142
SO THAT THAT FIGHT TO ME--
AND I THINK

1:10:16.177 --> 1:10:17.558
FOR MANY OTHER
YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE

1:10:17.592 --> 1:10:18.697
SUCH AS MYSELF AT THAT TIME--

1:10:18.731 --> 1:10:21.769
WAS A KIND OF TURNING POINT.

1:10:21.803 --> 1:10:24.254
AFTER 15 PUNISHING ROUNDS,

1:10:24.289 --> 1:10:26.360
THE DECISION WAS UNANIMOUS.

1:10:26.394 --> 1:10:29.915
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS NOW 28-0.

1:10:29.949 --> 1:10:32.538
ALI'S PERFORMANCE WAS
"A BARBAROUS DISPLAY

1:10:32.573 --> 1:10:36.335
OF CRUELTY," WROTE TEX MAULE
IN "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED."

1:10:36.370 --> 1:10:39.683
OTHER COLUMNISTS CALLED
HIM "MEAN AND MALICIOUS,"

1:10:39.718 --> 1:10:42.203
"COCKY" AND "ARROGANT."

1:10:42.238 --> 1:10:43.894
THE "NEW YORK TIMES"
RECOMMENDED THAT

1:10:43.929 --> 1:10:48.623
THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE
OUTLAW BOXING ALTOGETHER.

1:10:48.658 --> 1:10:50.487
AND I THINK THIS
PROVES TO THE PUBLIC

1:10:50.522 --> 1:10:52.386
AND ALL OF THE DOUBTERS
OUT THERE THAT ERNIE TERRELL

1:10:52.420 --> 1:10:55.285
HAS NO CLASS WHATSOEVER
AND YOU CANNOT COMPARE HIM

1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:57.149
EVEN IN MY, UH, RANKING.

1:10:57.183 --> 1:10:58.702
I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE TO SAY
THAT REALLY,

1:10:58.737 --> 1:11:00.601
THE MAN FOUGHT
A COURAGEOUS FIGHT.

1:11:00.635 --> 1:11:01.912
YOU WOULD SAY
EVERYTHING IF I HAD LOST,

1:11:01.947 --> 1:11:03.638
ESPECIALLY YOU.

1:11:03.673 --> 1:11:05.433
NOW, I WON AND LET
ME HAVE MY SAY.

1:11:05.468 --> 1:11:07.608
TERRELL--LOOK. I PROVED
THAT HE WASN'T NOTHING.

1:11:07.642 --> 1:11:10.162
ALL RIGHT.IT'S A JOKE
CALLING HIM A CHAMPION,

1:11:10.196 --> 1:11:12.302
AND HE BETTER PRONOUNCE
MY NAME RIGHT FROM NOW ON.

1:11:12.337 --> 1:11:13.648
I'M TIRED OF TALKING.ALL RIGHT.

1:11:13.683 --> 1:11:14.822
THE CHAMP IS TIRED.

1:11:14.856 --> 1:11:16.824
MUHAMMAD, COME HERE.

1:11:16.858 --> 1:11:18.653
LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU.

1:11:18.688 --> 1:11:21.207
JOE LOUIS TONIGHT SAID
YOU'RE "A GREAT FIGHTER".

1:11:21.242 --> 1:11:22.726
I DON'T NEED JOE LOUIS
TO TELL ME I'M A GREAT FIGHTER.

1:11:22.761 --> 1:11:25.384
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU
FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS.

1:11:28.594 --> 1:11:31.356
IN MARCH, HE WOULD
FACE ZORA FOLLEY

1:11:31.390 --> 1:11:34.428
AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

1:11:34.462 --> 1:11:36.568
WHILE TRAINING
IN THE ARENA'S BASEMENT,

1:11:36.602 --> 1:11:38.363
ALI WAS APPROACHED
BY AN UP-AND-COMING

1:11:38.397 --> 1:11:41.262
23-YEAR-OLD HEAVYWEIGHT
FROM PHILADELPHIA

1:11:41.297 --> 1:11:44.955
WHO'D WON HIS FIRST
14 PROFESSIONAL FIGHTS.

1:11:44.990 --> 1:11:46.750
"I THOUGHT YOU WERE MUCH
LARGER,"

1:11:46.785 --> 1:11:48.442
JOE FRAZIER SAID TO ALI.

1:11:48.476 --> 1:11:51.203
"YOU LOOK PRETTY
SMALL TO ME."

1:11:51.237 --> 1:11:53.585
WHEN ALI SAID HE'D BE HAPPY
TO FIGHT FRAZIER

1:11:53.619 --> 1:11:57.658
IN TWO YEARS, THE YOUNGER BOXER
PROMISED TO BE READY.

1:11:57.692 --> 1:12:00.592
BEFORE LEAVING, FRAZIER
BOUGHT A $2.00 GLOSSY PRINT

1:12:00.626 --> 1:12:04.216
OF ALI
AND HAD THE CHAMPION SIGN IT.

1:12:07.530 --> 1:12:10.705
HIS LAST FIGHT WAS
WITH ZORA FOLLEY.

1:12:10.740 --> 1:12:14.226
HE KNOCKED HIM OUT.
TOOK 6 OR 7 ROUNDS.

1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:19.335
THE NEXT MORNING, WE'RE
IN THE LOWE'S MIDTOWN HOTEL,

1:12:19.369 --> 1:12:20.681
AND HE COMES IN,
AND I REMEMBER HE CUT

1:12:20.715 --> 1:12:22.372
HIMSELF SHAVING.

1:12:22.407 --> 1:12:24.374
HE'S GOT A BAND AID HERE,
AND HE LOOKS AT US,

1:12:24.409 --> 1:12:27.653
AND HE SAYS, "FELLAS, I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY NEXT FIGHT

1:12:27.688 --> 1:12:30.656
BECAUSE I GOT A MUCH
BIGGER FIGHT COMING."

1:12:30.691 --> 1:12:33.694
BEFORE THE FOLLEY
FIGHT, ALI HAD RECEIVED WORD

1:12:33.728 --> 1:12:35.903
THAT HE HAD BEEN
DRAFTED AND WOULD HAVE

1:12:35.937 --> 1:12:40.010
TO REPORT FOR INDUCTION
THE FOLLOWING MONTH.

1:12:40.045 --> 1:12:43.497
WHILE HIS LAWYERS PREPARED
TO CHALLENGE THE DRAFT ORDER,

1:12:43.531 --> 1:12:46.638
ALI MET PRIVATELY
WITH DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.

1:12:46.672 --> 1:12:48.467
IN LOUISVILLE.

1:12:48.502 --> 1:12:50.400
KING WAS IN TOWN TO
PROTEST THE CITY'S

1:12:50.435 --> 1:12:52.333
SEGREGATED HOUSING.

1:12:52.368 --> 1:12:55.681
THOUGH THE TWO MEN DIFFERED
ABOUT BLACK SEPARATISM,

1:12:55.716 --> 1:12:57.752
THEY FOUND COMMON GROUND
IN THEIR VIEWS

1:12:57.787 --> 1:12:59.823
ON THE WAR IN VIETNAM.

1:12:59.858 --> 1:13:01.756
WHAT DID YOU DISCUSS
BACK IN THE HOTEL ROOM?

1:13:01.791 --> 1:13:03.309
NOTHING. JUST FRIENDS.

1:13:03.344 --> 1:13:05.726
JUST LIKE KHRUSHCHEV
AND KENNEDY

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:07.521
AND EVERYBODY.

1:13:07.555 --> 1:13:09.523
WHEN PEOPLE--
POLITICIANS

1:13:09.557 --> 1:13:11.663
OF ALL OTHER WHITE RACES
COME TOGETHER,

1:13:11.697 --> 1:13:13.768
AND THEY, ALTHOUGH
THEY BELIEVE DIFFERENT,

1:13:13.803 --> 1:13:15.874
THEY THINK DIFFERENT,
WHITES CAN COME TOGETHER

1:13:15.908 --> 1:13:17.634
AND DISCUSS
THE COMMON CAUSE,

1:13:17.669 --> 1:13:19.360
BUT WHENEVER A FEW
OF US COME TOGETHER,

1:13:19.395 --> 1:13:21.017
THE WORLD IS SHOOK UP,

1:13:21.051 --> 1:13:22.950
AND I SAY WHATEVER WENT
BACK THERE IS OUR BUSINESS.

1:13:22.984 --> 1:13:24.434
REVEREND KING,
DO YOU AGREE?

1:13:24.469 --> 1:13:25.987
OH, YES, YES.

1:13:26.022 --> 1:13:30.854
WE HAD A VERY
GOOD DISCUSSION
ON MANY MATTERS,

1:13:30.889 --> 1:13:32.373
AND OF COURSE THESE
ARE NOT THINGS

1:13:32.408 --> 1:13:34.306
THAT WE WOULD
DISCUSS HERE,

1:13:34.340 --> 1:13:36.688
BUT WE DO HAVE
COMMON PROBLEMS

1:13:36.722 --> 1:13:38.552
AND COMMON CONCERNS,

1:13:38.586 --> 1:13:43.453
AND ABOVE ALL,
AS MUHAMMAD ALI
HAS JUST SAID,

1:13:43.488 --> 1:13:47.043
WE ARE ALL VICTIMS
OF THE SAME SYSTEM
OF OPPRESSION,

1:13:47.077 --> 1:13:51.841
AND EVEN THOUGH WE
MAY HAVE DIFFERENT
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS,

1:13:51.875 --> 1:13:54.499
THIS DOES NOT
AT ALL BRING ABOUT

1:13:54.533 --> 1:13:55.914
A DIFFERENCE IN
TERMS OF OUR CONCERNS.

1:13:55.948 --> 1:13:57.605
STILL BROTHERS,
STILL BROTHERS.

1:13:57.640 --> 1:13:59.089
DO YOU SHARE THE SAME--
ONE MORE QUESTION.

1:13:59.124 --> 1:14:01.747
DO YOU SHARE THE SAME
CONCERN THAT MUHAMMAD HAS

1:14:01.782 --> 1:14:03.473
FOR HIS DRAFT STATUS?

1:14:03.508 --> 1:14:05.441
OH, I CERTAINLY DO.

1:14:05.475 --> 1:14:06.994
MY VIEWS ON THE DRAFT
ARE VERY CLEAR.

1:14:07.028 --> 1:14:08.720
I'M AGAINST IT,

1:14:08.754 --> 1:14:11.826
AND I THINK THE SOONER
OUR COUNTRY DOES AWAY

1:14:11.861 --> 1:14:15.381
WITH THE DRAFT,
THE BETTER IT WILL
BE FOR EVERYBODY.

1:14:15.416 --> 1:14:18.074
GET OUT,
GET OUT, GET OUT OF VIETNAM...

1:14:18.108 --> 1:14:21.387
IN APRIL
OF 1967, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

1:14:21.422 --> 1:14:25.806
OF ANTI-WAR PROTESTERS MARCHED
IN NEW YORK CITY,

1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:29.119
BUT MOST AMERICANS
STILL SUPPORTED THE WAR,

1:14:29.154 --> 1:14:32.744
AND CRITICIZING U.S. POLICY
ON VIETNAM REMAINED

1:14:32.778 --> 1:14:34.573
POLITICALLY TREACHEROUS,

1:14:34.608 --> 1:14:37.058
ESPECIALLY
FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

1:14:39.129 --> 1:14:41.925
MEANWHILE,
MUHAMMAD ALI'S LAWYERS

1:14:41.960 --> 1:14:45.446
HAD DELAYED HIS INDUCTION DATE
BY CLAIMING THE BOXER RESIDED

1:14:45.481 --> 1:14:49.726
IN HOUSTON, WHERE HE HAD TRAINED
FOR HIS RECENT FIGHTS.

1:14:49.761 --> 1:14:52.522
NOW A NEW ORDER REQUIRED
HIM TO REPORT

1:14:52.557 --> 1:14:54.869
TO LOCAL DRAFT BOARD NUMBER 47

1:14:54.904 --> 1:14:59.702
IN HOUSTON
30 A.M. ON APRIL 28.

1:14:59.736 --> 1:15:03.119
BEFORE HE LEFT LOUISVILLE,
ALI GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE

1:15:03.153 --> 1:15:06.916
EXPLAINING HIS POSITION
AND HIS PLANS.

1:15:06.950 --> 1:15:10.471
WHY SHOULD ME
AND OTHER SO-CALLED NEGROES GO

1:15:10.506 --> 1:15:15.062
10,000 MILES AWAY
FROM HOME HERE IN AMERICA

1:15:15.096 --> 1:15:18.755
TO DROP BOMBS AND BULLETS
ON OTHER INNOCENT

1:15:18.790 --> 1:15:22.483
BROWN PEOPLE
WHO'S NEVER BOTHERED US?

1:15:22.518 --> 1:15:28.454
AND I WILL SAY DIRECTLY,
NO, I WILL NOT GO 10,000 MILES

1:15:28.489 --> 1:15:34.046
TO HELP KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE.

1:15:34.081 --> 1:15:36.808
5 DAYS LATER,
MUHAMMAD ALI, FLANKED

1:15:36.842 --> 1:15:40.156
BY HIS LAWYERS, ARRIVED
AT THE OLD POST OFFICE BUILDING

1:15:40.190 --> 1:15:42.814
IN HOUSTON.

1:15:42.848 --> 1:15:45.817
INSIDE, AS ALI
UNDERWENT HIS PHYSICAL,

1:15:45.851 --> 1:15:48.578
HE JOKED WITH HIS FELLOW
RECRUITS, DEMONSTRATING

1:15:48.613 --> 1:15:51.719
THE ALI SHUFFLE
IN HIS UNDERWEAR.

1:15:51.754 --> 1:15:55.102
THEN AT THE INDUCTION
CEREMONY, ALI REFUSED TO

1:15:55.136 --> 1:15:58.933
STEP FORWARD
WHEN HIS NAME WAS CALLED.

1:15:58.968 --> 1:16:01.591
A NAVY LIEUTENANT EXPLAINED
THE PENALTY

1:16:01.626 --> 1:16:04.767
SHOULD HE BE FOUND GUILTY
OF REFUSING INDUCTION--

1:16:04.801 --> 1:16:09.634
A $10,000 FINE AND UP
TO 5 YEARS IN PRISON.

1:16:09.668 --> 1:16:12.533
GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE
TO STEP FORWARD,

1:16:12.568 --> 1:16:14.984
ALI REFUSED AGAIN.

1:16:15.018 --> 1:16:16.606
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1:16:16.641 --> 1:16:18.884
MR. MUHAMMAD ALI
HAS JUST REFUSED TO BE

1:16:18.919 --> 1:16:22.612
INDUCTED INTO
THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.

1:16:22.647 --> 1:16:25.650
THE REACTION
WAS SWIFT AND SEVERE.

1:16:25.684 --> 1:16:28.169
WITHIN HOURS, THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE NEW YORK STATE

1:16:28.204 --> 1:16:30.827
ATHLETIC COMMISSION
DENOUNCED HIS CONDUCT

1:16:30.862 --> 1:16:33.623
AS "DETRIMENTAL
TO THE INTERESTS OF BOXING,"

1:16:33.658 --> 1:16:37.144
STRIPPING HIM OF HIS LICENSE
TO FIGHT IN NEW YORK.

1:16:37.178 --> 1:16:39.249
ALMOST EVERY OTHER BOXING
COMMISSION

1:16:39.284 --> 1:16:42.632
IN THE UNITED STATES
FOLLOWED SUIT.

1:16:42.667 --> 1:16:45.186
THE WORLD BOXING
ASSOCIATION TOOK AWAY ALI'S

1:16:45.221 --> 1:16:48.604
TITLE FOR A SECOND TIME.

1:16:48.638 --> 1:16:50.882
WELL, AT THE TIME,
I WAS IN THE SERVICE,

1:16:50.916 --> 1:16:55.956
AND, UM, I--ONE WOULD THINK THAT
I WOULD--WOULD THINK OF HIM

1:16:55.990 --> 1:16:58.544
AS A TRAITOR OR SOMEONE
WHO DIDN'T WANT TO DO

1:16:58.579 --> 1:17:00.236
WHAT I'M DOING, YOU KNOW,

1:17:00.270 --> 1:17:02.134
BUT I WAS ALL FOR IT.

1:17:02.169 --> 1:17:04.654
AND I FOUND THAT MANY
OF THE BLACK SERVICEMEN

1:17:04.689 --> 1:17:07.139
WERE ALL FOR IT, AS WELL.

1:17:07.174 --> 1:17:09.590
THEY APPRECIATED HIM
SPEAKING UP BECAUSE

1:17:09.625 --> 1:17:11.765
AT THE TIME THERE WAS
A LOT OF DISSENT

1:17:11.799 --> 1:17:14.077
AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN
SERVICEMEN.

1:17:14.112 --> 1:17:17.115
THIS WAS THE VIETNAM ERA,
A LOT OF BLACK MEN WERE

1:17:17.149 --> 1:17:18.806
BEING KILLED.

1:17:18.841 --> 1:17:21.913
THEY WERE THINKING OF THEMSELVES
AS CANNON FODDER,

1:17:21.947 --> 1:17:25.123
AND I MET SOME OF THE MORE--

1:17:25.157 --> 1:17:28.644
SOME OF THE MOST RADICAL
FIGURES I'VE EVER MET

1:17:28.678 --> 1:17:31.785
IN THE RANKS
OF THE AIR FORCE AND THE ARMY.

1:17:31.819 --> 1:17:36.790
SO UH, WE--WE APPRECIATED
HIM SPEAKING OUT

1:17:36.824 --> 1:17:38.895
AND SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT.

1:17:38.930 --> 1:17:40.932
AS MUCH AS I THINK EVERYBODY
SHOULD PULL THEIR TOUR,

1:17:40.966 --> 1:17:44.763
I THINK THEY
ARE OVEREMPHASIZING

1:17:44.798 --> 1:17:46.938
THE NEED TO BRING CASSIUS CLAY
INTO THE SERVICE

1:17:46.972 --> 1:17:49.147
IF HE PROFESSES
TO BE A MUSLIM MINISTER.

1:17:49.181 --> 1:17:51.080
HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
ARE HIS OWN.

1:17:51.114 --> 1:17:54.290
THIS COUNTRY WAS SET UP
ON THE BASIC CONCEPT

1:17:54.324 --> 1:17:57.051
OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM,
OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.

1:17:57.086 --> 1:17:59.329
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE
SHOULD BE PERSECUTED

1:17:59.364 --> 1:18:01.918
OR RIDICULED BECAUSE
OF HIS BELIEFS.

1:18:01.953 --> 1:18:04.576
SIMPLY BECAUSE
MUHAMMAD ALI HAS THESE BELIEFS,

1:18:04.610 --> 1:18:08.097
IT'S NO REASON WHY PEOPLE
SHOULD--SHOULD GO AGAINST HIM.

1:18:08.131 --> 1:18:09.754
I THINK HE IS
A GREAT CHAMPION,

1:18:09.788 --> 1:18:11.721
AND, UH, THEY SHOULD RESPECT
HIS BELIEFS.

1:18:11.756 --> 1:18:13.585
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE RIGHT NOW.

1:18:13.619 --> 1:18:15.587
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
BEING UNNECESSARILY
HARSH ON HIM?

1:18:15.621 --> 1:18:17.071
I THINK THEY ARE.

1:18:17.106 --> 1:18:19.660
EVERYBODY KNEW THAT IF
HE HAD BEEN DRAFTED

1:18:19.695 --> 1:18:25.079
INTO THE ARMY HE WOULD--
LIKE JOE LOUIS AND JACK DEMPSEY

1:18:25.114 --> 1:18:28.980
AND EVERY OTHER BOXER,
HE'D GIVE SHOWS.

1:18:29.014 --> 1:18:30.809
HE'D GO AND SHAKE HANDS.

1:18:30.844 --> 1:18:33.122
HE'D BE
IN CHARGE OF MORALE.

1:18:33.156 --> 1:18:36.953
HE WASN'T GONNA BE
FIGHTING THE VIET CONG,

1:18:36.988 --> 1:18:38.161
AND HE KNEW THAT.

1:18:38.196 --> 1:18:39.956
EVERYBODY KNEW THAT.

1:18:39.991 --> 1:18:43.235
SO WHAT HE WAS GIVING UP
HAD TO BE FOR PRINCIPLE,

1:18:43.270 --> 1:18:46.963
COULDN'T BE FOR FEAR.

1:18:46.998 --> 1:18:50.933
ON JUNE 4, 1967,
JIM BROWN,

1:18:50.967 --> 1:18:54.039
THE RETIRED FOOTBALL STAR,
CONVENED A CLOSED-DOOR SUMMIT

1:18:54.074 --> 1:18:56.870
OF BLACK ATHLETES IN CLEVELAND.

1:18:56.904 --> 1:18:59.769
THEY INVITED MUHAMMAD ALI
IN HOPES THAT HE MIGHT

1:18:59.804 --> 1:19:03.393
ENTERTAIN A BACK-CHANNEL OFFER
FROM PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON

1:19:03.428 --> 1:19:08.053
THAT WOULD KEEP HIM OUT OF JAIL
AND IN THE BOXING RING.

1:19:08.088 --> 1:19:09.917
ABDUL-A NUMBER OF
THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MEMBERS

1:19:09.952 --> 1:19:11.160
OF THE CLEVELAND BROWNS.

1:19:11.194 --> 1:19:13.334
BILL RUSSELL WAS THERE, MYSELF,

1:19:13.369 --> 1:19:17.200
AND A FEW OTHER
PEOPLE WHO WERE RELATED

1:19:17.235 --> 1:19:20.721
TO SPORTS,
BUT WE ALL WANTED TO JUST SEE

1:19:20.756 --> 1:19:23.655
WHAT MUHAMMAD ALI WAS ALL ABOUT
WITH REGARD

1:19:23.689 --> 1:19:25.795
TO HIS STANCE ON VIETNAM.

1:19:25.830 --> 1:19:27.763
JIM,
WHAT DO YOU THINK

1:19:27.797 --> 1:19:31.180
OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF AH THE CHAMP
GOING TO JAIL,

1:19:31.214 --> 1:19:33.423
AND WHAT AH, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT THE IMAGE

1:19:33.458 --> 1:19:36.668
THIS MIGHT CREATE
AMONG NEGRO ATHLETES?

1:19:36.702 --> 1:19:40.258
WELL AS YOU KNOW,
RELIGION IS BASED ON BELIEF.

1:19:40.292 --> 1:19:43.917
WE'RE ALL ARE OF VARIOUS
RELIGIONS IN HERE,

1:19:43.951 --> 1:19:46.816
AND ONCE THE CHAMP
CONVINCED US THAT IT WAS

1:19:46.851 --> 1:19:51.821
SOLELY A RELIGIOUS MATTER
AND THAT HE BELIEVED COMPLETELY,

1:19:51.856 --> 1:19:54.203
THEN I HAD TO LEAVE IT
AT THAT AND GIVE HIM

1:19:54.237 --> 1:19:57.896
RESPECT AS FAR AS HIS BELIEF.

1:19:57.931 --> 1:19:59.139
WE WERE UNIFIED.

1:19:59.173 --> 1:20:01.037
YOU KNOW,
WE STOOD BEHIND HIM.

1:20:01.072 --> 1:20:04.144
WE WISHED HIM SUCCESS,

1:20:04.178 --> 1:20:07.733
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE
WAS NOTHING THAT WE COULD SAY

1:20:07.768 --> 1:20:12.290
FORMALLY THAT WAS GONNA MITIGATE
WHAT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH.

1:20:12.324 --> 1:20:14.085
"I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT MUHAMMAD ALI,"

1:20:14.119 --> 1:20:15.983
BILL RUSSELL SAID.

1:20:16.018 --> 1:20:18.814
"HE IS BETTER EQUIPPED THAN
ANYONE I KNOW TO WITHSTAND

1:20:18.848 --> 1:20:20.988
"THE TRIALS IN STORE FOR HIM.

1:20:21.023 --> 1:20:25.303
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS
THE REST OF US."

1:20:25.337 --> 1:20:27.788
ABDUL-ALL THE LIGHT
IN THE ROOM FOCUSED

1:20:27.823 --> 1:20:29.100
ON HIM IT SEEMED.

1:20:29.134 --> 1:20:31.757
YOU KNOW, HE
KIND OF ATTRACTED LIGHT.

1:20:31.792 --> 1:20:34.864
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS,
UH, WHO HE WAS.

1:20:34.899 --> 1:20:36.970
AND I SAW
IN MUHAMMAD ALI'S CHARACTER

1:20:37.004 --> 1:20:40.387
THE WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON
THE BURDENS

1:20:40.421 --> 1:20:44.046
OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS
IN CONFRONTING THE RACISM

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:45.806
THAT WE ALL HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

1:20:45.841 --> 1:20:48.947
HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE THAT ON,

1:20:48.982 --> 1:20:53.918
AND I WANTED TO
SUPPORT HIM IN THAT.

1:20:53.952 --> 1:20:57.438
TO ME, IT FELT JUST LIKE
I FELT ABOUT JACKIE ROBINSON.

1:20:57.473 --> 1:21:01.822
YOU KNOW, I WATCHED HIM,
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY,

1:21:01.857 --> 1:21:03.341
AND IT SEEMED
TO ME THAT MUHAMMAD ALI

1:21:03.375 --> 1:21:07.897
JUST TOOK UP THAT MANTLE.

1:21:07.932 --> 1:21:10.866
TWO WEEKS LATER,
AN ALL-WHITE HOUSTON JURY

1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:14.145
FOUND ALI GUILTY
OF REFUSING THE DRAFT.

1:21:14.179 --> 1:21:17.148
THE JUDGE, IGNORING
THE MORE LENIENT RECOMMENDATION

1:21:17.182 --> 1:21:21.186
OF THE PROSECUTOR,
SENTENCED HIM TO THE MAXIMUM--

1:21:21.221 --> 1:21:25.501
5 YEARS
IN PRISON AND A $10,000 FINE,

1:21:25.535 --> 1:21:28.814
AND HE WOULD HAVE TO
SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT.

1:21:30.126 --> 1:21:33.543
ALI'S LAWYERS IMMEDIATELY
FILED AN APPEAL,

1:21:33.578 --> 1:21:36.098
PREPARED TO GO ALL THE WAY
TO THE SUPREME COURT

1:21:36.132 --> 1:21:40.274
IF NECESSARY, A PROCESS
THAT COULD TAKE YEARS.

1:21:40.309 --> 1:21:43.829
ALI REMAINED FREE
BUT WITHOUT HIS TITLE

1:21:43.864 --> 1:21:47.005
OR A LICENSE TO BOX.

1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:50.422
HE FULLY EXPECTED THAT
HE WOULD ONE DAY GO TO JAIL

1:21:50.457 --> 1:21:52.459
FOR HIS BELIEFS.

1:21:52.493 --> 1:21:54.944
WE, WHO ARE FOLLOWERS OF
THE HONORABLE ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

1:21:54.979 --> 1:21:56.049
THE RELIGION OF ISLAM,
WE BELIEVE

1:21:56.083 --> 1:21:58.465
IN OBEYING THE LAWS OF THE LAND.

1:21:58.499 --> 1:22:01.088
WE ARE TAUGHT TO OBEY
THE LAWS OF THE LAND

1:22:01.123 --> 1:22:05.334
AS LONG AS IT DON'T CONFLICT
WITH OUR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

1:22:05.368 --> 1:22:07.474
WILL YOU GO
INTO SERVICE AS SUCH?

1:22:07.508 --> 1:22:09.338
THIS WOULD BE
A THOUSAND PERCENT

1:22:09.372 --> 1:22:11.478
AGAINST THE TEACHINGS OF
THE HONORABLE ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

1:22:11.512 --> 1:22:13.963
THE RELIGION OF ISLAM,
AND THE HOLY QURAN,

1:22:13.998 --> 1:22:15.378
THE HOLY BOOK
THAT WE BELIEVE IN.

1:22:15.413 --> 1:22:17.933
THIS WOULD ALL BE
DENOUNCING AND DEFYING

1:22:17.967 --> 1:22:19.935
EVERYTHING THAT I STAND FOR.

1:22:19.969 --> 1:22:22.282
THIS WOULD MEAN
OF COURSE THAT YOU
STAND THE CHANCE

1:22:22.316 --> 1:22:24.146
OF GOING TO JAIL
AS A RESULT

1:22:24.180 --> 1:22:25.561
OF NOT GOING
INTO SERVICE.

1:22:25.595 --> 1:22:27.839
WELL, WHATEVER THE PUNISHMENT,

1:22:27.873 --> 1:22:30.117
WHATEVER THE PERSECUTION IS
FOR STANDING UP

1:22:30.152 --> 1:22:33.051
FOR MY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS,
EVEN IF IT MEANS FACING

1:22:33.086 --> 1:22:35.088
MACHINE GUN FIRE THAT DAY,

1:22:35.122 --> 1:22:38.056
I WILL FACE IT BEFORE
DENOUNCING ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

1:22:38.091 --> 1:22:39.437
AND THE RELIGION OF ISLAM.

1:22:39.471 --> 1:22:42.026
I'M READY TO DIE.MM-HMM.

1:22:43.165 --> 1:22:46.892
WHEN I THINK ABOUT HIM
SAYING, "IF THEY WAN TO PUT ME

1:22:46.927 --> 1:22:50.172
"BEFORE A FIRING SQUAD
TOMORROW, I'M READY TO DIE

1:22:50.206 --> 1:22:52.484
BEFORE I ABANDON
MY RELIGION,"

1:22:52.519 --> 1:22:54.417
UM...

1:22:57.317 --> 1:23:00.354
THAT'S IT.

1:23:00.389 --> 1:23:03.979
YOU CAN'T TEACH THAT KIND OF
THING IN LECTURES, IN BOOKS.

1:23:04.013 --> 1:23:06.360
THAT KIND OF THING
HAS TO BE MODELED,

1:23:06.395 --> 1:23:09.018
AND MODELS TURN INTO TRADITIONS,

1:23:09.053 --> 1:23:13.402
AND TRADITIONS PROVIDE PEOPLE
WITH THE MECHANICAL MEMORY

1:23:13.436 --> 1:23:15.956
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

1:23:15.991 --> 1:23:19.063
THAT'S WHAT MUHAMMAD ALI
REPRESENTED IN THAT MOMENT.

1:23:19.097 --> 1:23:23.136
I MEAN, ANYBODY NOW FACED
WITH A MAJOR DECISION

1:23:23.170 --> 1:23:26.311
IN WHICH THE RIGHT WAY IS CLEAR
AND THE WRONG WAY IS CLEAR

1:23:26.346 --> 1:23:30.108
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE DIRE,
NOW THEY HAVE A MODEL

1:23:30.143 --> 1:23:32.524
THAT THEY CAN FALL
BACK ON PSYCHOLOGICALLY,

1:23:32.559 --> 1:23:34.319
EMOTIONALLY, SPIRITUALLY.

1:23:34.354 --> 1:23:36.977
THAT'S WHAT MUHAMMAD ALI
REPRESENTED IN THAT MOMENT,

1:23:37.012 --> 1:23:41.050
AND THAT TO ME, THAT MOMENT
WILL LIVE ON FOREVER.

1:23:46.124 --> 1:23:48.540
BACK
IN THE SUMMER OF 1966,

1:23:48.575 --> 1:23:51.405
WHILE IN CHICAGO BETWEEN FIGHTS,
ALI HAD BEEN DRIVING

1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:56.134
AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE
WITH A GERMAN PHOTOJOURNALIST.

1:23:56.169 --> 1:23:58.930
AFTER ALI REQUESTED THAT
HIS DRIVER RETURN

1:23:58.964 --> 1:24:02.278
TO A NATION OF ISLAM BAKERY
FOR A THIRD TIME,

1:24:02.313 --> 1:24:05.937
THE PHOTOGRAPHER FOLLOWED HIM
INSIDE AND REALIZED

1:24:05.971 --> 1:24:09.665
THE REASON
FOR THE FREQUENT VISITS.

1:24:09.699 --> 1:24:13.427
BEHIND THE COUNTER STOOD
A STRIKING 16-YEAR-OLD

1:24:13.462 --> 1:24:16.361
NAMED BELINDA BOYD.

1:24:16.396 --> 1:24:18.053
ALI WAS A VERY
GORGEOUS GUY,

1:24:18.087 --> 1:24:19.433
GOOD-LOOKING.

1:24:19.468 --> 1:24:21.608
I WAS ATTRACTED
TO HIM RIGHT AWAY.

1:24:21.642 --> 1:24:27.096
HE WAS A VERY WARM,
DOWN-TO-EARTH, KIND PERSON.

1:24:27.131 --> 1:24:29.374
ALI IS VERY FLIRTATIOUS, TOO.

1:24:29.409 --> 1:24:32.653
I THINK THAT--I THINK
THAT'S THE CHARM

1:24:32.688 --> 1:24:34.379
THAT I LIKED ABOUT HIM.

1:24:34.414 --> 1:24:36.278
HE WAS ALWAYS HAPPY.

1:24:36.312 --> 1:24:38.521
THE DAUGHTER
OF MUSLIMS, BOYD HAD ATTENDED

1:24:38.556 --> 1:24:41.731
ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ISLAM

1:24:41.766 --> 1:24:44.251
IN CHICAGO AND HAD BEEN
A FREQUENT GUEST

1:24:44.286 --> 1:24:47.358
AT THE HOME OF ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

1:24:47.392 --> 1:24:50.982
HERBERT MUHAMMAD HAD
ENCOURAGED ALI TO PURSUE HER,

1:24:51.016 --> 1:24:52.708
AND SOON THE TWO WERE
SEEING EACH OTHER

1:24:52.742 --> 1:24:55.573
AWAY FROM THE BAKERY.

1:24:55.607 --> 1:24:59.715
ON AUGUST 18, 1967,
MUHAMMAD AND BELINDA

1:24:59.749 --> 1:25:02.511
WERE MARRIED AND MOVED
INTO A SMALL BRICK HOUSE

1:25:02.545 --> 1:25:05.410
ON THE SOUTH SIDE.

1:25:05.445 --> 1:25:07.550
BOTH WERE TALL AND ATHLETIC,

1:25:07.585 --> 1:25:09.483
VOLUBLE AND CHARMING,

1:25:09.518 --> 1:25:11.658
AND BELINDA,
WHO HAD LOVED MUHAMMAD

1:25:11.692 --> 1:25:13.487
SINCE SHE WAS
A YOUNG TEENAGER,

1:25:13.522 --> 1:25:16.041
COULD MIMIC HIS CADENCE.

1:25:16.076 --> 1:25:19.148
THE COUPLE WERE SO MUCH
ALIKE THAT ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

1:25:19.183 --> 1:25:24.291
ONCE JOKED THAT ALI
HAD MARRIED HIS TWIN.

1:25:24.326 --> 1:25:27.225
MY MOM AND MY DAD WERE
A LOT ALIKE.

1:25:27.260 --> 1:25:31.229
I THINK SHE WAS GOOD FOR HIM
IN THE SENSE

1:25:31.264 --> 1:25:32.782
THAT SHE WASN'T QUIET AND SHY.

1:25:32.817 --> 1:25:35.475
SHE WAS STRONG,
AND SHE SPOKE HER MIND.

1:25:35.509 --> 1:25:39.168
I THINK MY DAD WAS ATTRACTED
TO HER BECAUSE

1:25:39.203 --> 1:25:41.239
SHE WAS A STRONG WOMAN

1:25:41.274 --> 1:25:44.415
AND SHE WAS A MUSLIM

1:25:44.449 --> 1:25:49.523
AND SHE HAD VALUES THAT
MY DAD RESPECTED AND LOVED.

1:25:49.558 --> 1:25:51.525
WITHOUT INCOME
FROM FIGHTS,

1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:53.251
MONEY WAS TIGHT.

1:25:53.286 --> 1:25:55.633
BELINDA SEWED HER OWN
CLOTHES AND DIPPED

1:25:55.667 --> 1:25:59.430
INTO HER COLLEGE FUND
TO COVER EXPENSES.

1:25:59.464 --> 1:26:01.225
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'D GIVE US MONEY.

1:26:01.259 --> 1:26:03.503
HE WOULD GIVE ME
MONEY TO SURVIVE,

1:26:03.537 --> 1:26:05.367
AND I WOULDN'T LET HIM KNOW IT
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM

1:26:05.401 --> 1:26:08.370
TO FEEL BAD AS A MAN,
NOT BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT US.

1:26:08.404 --> 1:26:09.785
THEY STRUGGLED.

1:26:09.819 --> 1:26:12.270
MY DAD COULDN'T MAKE
ANY MONEY,

1:26:12.305 --> 1:26:16.378
BUT MY MOM JUST DEEPLY,
JUST TRULY LOVED HIM,

1:26:16.412 --> 1:26:19.829
AND SHE WOULD'VE--
SHE DIDN'T CARE

1:26:19.864 --> 1:26:21.486
ABOUT ANY OF THAT STUFF.

1:26:21.521 --> 1:26:22.832
SHE JUST REALLY LOVED HIM,

1:26:22.867 --> 1:26:24.765
AND SHE'D FOLLOW
HIM ANYWHERE.

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:28.183
SO MY DAD WENT ON
THE SPEAKING CIRCUIT,

1:26:28.217 --> 1:26:30.150
AND HE STARTED TO SPEAK
AT COLLEGES

1:26:30.185 --> 1:26:32.463
AS A WAYS TO MAKE MONEY.

1:26:34.189 --> 1:26:37.088
WITHOUT ANY
FURTHER INTRODUCTION,

1:26:37.122 --> 1:26:41.161
THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING
CHAMPION MUHAMMAD ALI!

1:26:54.243 --> 1:26:56.176
FIRST OF ALL...

1:26:57.591 --> 1:26:59.386
FIRST OF ALL,
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK

1:26:59.421 --> 1:27:05.116
THE STUDENT GOVERNING BODY
FOR INVITING ME HERE

1:27:05.150 --> 1:27:11.156
TO SPEAK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL
AND WORTHY OCCASION TONIGHT.

1:27:11.191 --> 1:27:13.262
I WENT TO SOME
OF HIS COLLEGE CONCERTS,

1:27:13.297 --> 1:27:15.816
AND IN THE BEGINNING,
THEY WERE TERRIBLE,

1:27:15.851 --> 1:27:19.717
BUT THEN HE REALLY
STARTED EVOLVING.

1:27:19.751 --> 1:27:22.306
HE HAD PREPARED HALF
A DOZEN SPEECHES BASED

1:27:22.340 --> 1:27:25.101
ON THE TEACHINGS
OF ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

1:27:25.136 --> 1:27:27.276
AND THE POLITICAL HUMOR
OF THE ACTIVIST

1:27:27.311 --> 1:27:30.279
AND COMEDIAN DICK GREGORY.

1:27:30.314 --> 1:27:33.420
THE BLACK AND WHITE PROBLEM
IN AMERICA IS DIVINE.

1:27:33.455 --> 1:27:36.320
IT'S NOT A RACIAL THING
WHERE SOME ORGANIZATION

1:27:36.354 --> 1:27:37.735
IS GOING TO FREE US.

1:27:37.769 --> 1:27:39.495
BLACK PEOPLE NEED
TO KNOW THEIR CULTURE.

1:27:39.530 --> 1:27:40.841
BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
THEIR NAME.

1:27:40.876 --> 1:27:42.809
BLACK PEOPLE ARE MENTALLY DEAD.

1:27:42.843 --> 1:27:45.570
THIS IS WHY ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
TEACHES US THAT JESUS SAID,

1:27:45.605 --> 1:27:47.262
"YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH,

1:27:47.296 --> 1:27:48.780
AND THE TRUTH ALONE
WILL MAKE YOU FREE."

1:27:48.815 --> 1:27:50.299
JESUS DIDN'T SAY,
"ABRAHAM LINCOLN

1:27:50.334 --> 1:27:51.576
WILL MAKE YOU FREE."

1:27:51.611 --> 1:27:53.164
JESUS DIDN'T SAY, "THE CONGRESS

1:27:53.198 --> 1:27:54.303
GONNA MAKE YOU FREE."

1:27:54.338 --> 1:27:55.649
JESUS DIDN'T SAY, "INTEGRATION

1:27:55.684 --> 1:27:57.133
AND OPEN HOUSING
WILL MAKE YOU FREE."

1:27:57.168 --> 1:27:58.445
JESUS DIDN'T SAY,
"INTERMARRIAGE

1:27:58.480 --> 1:27:59.826
WITH WHITE FOLKS
WILL MAKE YOU FREE."

1:27:59.860 --> 1:28:01.379
JESUS SAID, "TRUTH
MAKE YOU FREE,"

1:28:01.414 --> 1:28:02.760
AND BLACK PEOPLE ARE
NOT FREE TODAY

1:28:02.794 --> 1:28:04.382
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
KNOW THE TRUTH,

1:28:04.417 --> 1:28:05.763
AND ELIJAH MUHAMMAD IS
THE ONLIEST MAN

1:28:05.797 --> 1:28:07.627
WITH THAT TRUTH.

1:28:07.661 --> 1:28:10.250
I WORKED FOR
"MUHAMMAD SPEAKS" AT THE TIME.

1:28:10.285 --> 1:28:12.321
WE FOLLOWED HIM PERIODICALLY.

1:28:12.356 --> 1:28:15.876
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
TOO REVERENTIAL TOWARD HIM

1:28:15.911 --> 1:28:18.776
BECAUSE, AGAIN,
THE OFFICIAL LINE OF THE NATION

1:28:18.810 --> 1:28:20.778
WAS ANTI-SPORT AND PLAY,

1:28:20.812 --> 1:28:21.848
AND SO WE DIDN'T WANT
TO, YOU KNOW,

1:28:21.882 --> 1:28:23.919
PUSH THAT TOO FAR.

1:28:23.953 --> 1:28:25.748
HE PREACHED
AT MUSLIM MOSQUES

1:28:25.783 --> 1:28:29.614
IN SAN FRANCISCO AND MIAMI,
HOUSTON AND NEW YORK,

1:28:29.649 --> 1:28:32.928
LECTURED AT SCHOOLS,
INCLUDING APPALACHIAN STATE,

1:28:32.962 --> 1:28:36.932
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,

1:28:36.966 --> 1:28:39.348
AND ADDRESSED
ANTI-WAR PROTESTERS

1:28:39.383 --> 1:28:42.731
AND A BLACK PANTHER RALLY.

1:28:42.765 --> 1:28:44.905
SO THERE WERE THESE
CLASHING SENSIBILITIES

1:28:44.940 --> 1:28:47.563
OUT THERE,
AND MUHAMMAD ALI COMING

1:28:47.598 --> 1:28:49.841
FROM THE NATION OF ISLAM,
WHICH KIND OF REPRESENTED

1:28:49.876 --> 1:28:55.191
THE BLACK MILITANT ASPECT
BUT YET RESISTING THE WAR,

1:28:55.226 --> 1:28:58.885
WHICH COINCIDED
WITH THE HIPPIE THING,

1:28:58.919 --> 1:29:01.370
AND SO I THINK THAT WAS
INDEED PART OF THE REASON

1:29:01.405 --> 1:29:03.821
WHY HE BECAME SUCH
A GALVANIZING FIGURE.

1:29:05.443 --> 1:29:09.378
HIS ABILITY TO EMBRACE
OTHER GROUPS,

1:29:09.413 --> 1:29:13.762
EVEN AS HE PROFESSED THE KIND OF
RACIALIST DOCTRINE HIMSELF.

1:29:13.796 --> 1:29:15.211
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
WHO HAVE ACCESS

1:29:15.246 --> 1:29:17.490
TO THAT KIND OF COMPLEXITY.

1:29:17.524 --> 1:29:20.320
WE HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED.

1:29:20.355 --> 1:29:22.426
WHEN YOU WENT TO
CHURCH TO LOOK AT JESUS,

1:29:22.460 --> 1:29:24.738
YOU SAW A WHITE.

1:29:24.773 --> 1:29:27.707
WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE ANGELS,
YOU SAW WHITES.

1:29:27.741 --> 1:29:31.918
EVERYTHING WHITE.
EVERYTHING OF AUTHORITY WHITE.

1:29:31.952 --> 1:29:35.508
WHITE OWL CIGARS,
WHITE SWAN SOAP,

1:29:35.542 --> 1:29:37.820
KING WHITE SOAP,
WHITE CLOUD TISSUE PAPER,

1:29:37.855 --> 1:29:41.859
WHITE RAIN HAIR RINSE--
WSHEWWW---WHITE TORNADO.

1:29:44.586 --> 1:29:47.451
WHO EVER HEARD OF
A WHITE TORNADO?

1:29:47.485 --> 1:29:48.797
TORNADOS ARE BLACK.

1:29:48.831 --> 1:29:49.901
YOU CAN SEE THEM
WHEN THEY'RE COMING.

1:29:49.936 --> 1:29:51.006
TORNADOS ARE BLACK.

1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:52.490
AIN'T NO WHITE TORNADOS.

1:29:57.909 --> 1:30:00.567
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT BLACK?

1:30:00.602 --> 1:30:02.535
SEE, YOU'VE BEEN TRICKED.

1:30:02.569 --> 1:30:05.779
YOU'VE BEEN TRICKED TO LOVE
OTHERS AND HATE YOURSELF.

1:30:05.814 --> 1:30:09.680
WHAT MUHAMMAD ALI DID WAS
REALLY TEAR THE MASK OFF

1:30:09.714 --> 1:30:12.579
OF COMFORT OF WHITE PEOPLE
IN BEING

1:30:12.614 --> 1:30:14.685
IN THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD.

1:30:14.719 --> 1:30:19.275
COMFORT OF OUR OWN PRIVILEGE
AND OUR OWN INABILITY

1:30:19.310 --> 1:30:21.485
TO IDENTIFY
WITH PEOPLE OF COLOR,

1:30:21.519 --> 1:30:25.627
AND HE DID IT
WITH ALL THE TOOLS THAT HE HAD.

1:30:27.939 --> 1:30:29.907
I'M NOT GONNA HELP
NOBODY GET SOMETHING

1:30:29.941 --> 1:30:31.529
MY NEGROES DON'T HAVE.

1:30:31.564 --> 1:30:32.634
IF I'M GONNA TO DIE,
I'LL DIE RIGHT NOW

1:30:32.668 --> 1:30:34.014
RIGHT HERE FIGHTING YOU.

1:30:34.049 --> 1:30:35.602
IF I WANT TO DIE.

1:30:35.637 --> 1:30:37.432
YOU MY ENEMY.

1:30:37.466 --> 1:30:38.916
MY ENEMY IS THE WHITE PEOPLE,
NOT VIET CONGS

1:30:38.950 --> 1:30:41.366
OR CHINESE OR JAPANESE.

1:30:41.401 --> 1:30:42.816
YOU MY OPPOSER
WHEN I WANT FREEDOM.

1:30:42.851 --> 1:30:44.680
YOU MY OPPOSER WHEN
I WANT JUSTICE.

1:30:44.715 --> 1:30:46.406
YOU MY OPPOSER
WHEN I WANT EQUALITY.

1:30:46.441 --> 1:30:48.304
YOU WON'T EVEN STAND UP
FOR ME IN AMERICA

1:30:48.339 --> 1:30:50.514
FOR MY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS,
AND YOU WANT ME TO GO SOMEWHERE

1:30:50.548 --> 1:30:51.791
AND FIGHT,
BUT YOU WON'T EVEN STAND UP

1:30:51.825 --> 1:30:54.000
FOR ME HERE AT HOME.

1:30:56.865 --> 1:31:00.903
HE USED HIS TONGUE TO
LACERATE RACISM

1:31:00.938 --> 1:31:03.354
AND WHITE SUPREMACY
AND OPPRESSION

1:31:03.388 --> 1:31:04.769
IN AMERICAN SOCIETY.

1:31:04.804 --> 1:31:08.566
HE BECAME MORE MILITANT,
NOT LESS.

1:31:08.601 --> 1:31:10.810
HE BECAME MORE ASSERTIVE,
NOT LESS.

1:31:10.844 --> 1:31:13.537
HE BECAME MORE
CONFRONTATIONAL, NOT LESS.

1:31:13.571 --> 1:31:16.401
HE'S NOT SUGAR COATING IT.

1:31:16.436 --> 1:31:19.888
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED
WHY WE TAKE SO MUCH HELL? HUH?

1:31:19.922 --> 1:31:22.891
SERVED THE COUNTRY SO
FAITHFUL FOR 400 YEARS?

1:31:22.925 --> 1:31:25.687
FOUGHT IN ALL OF THE WARS
AND STILL DYING IN THE WARS,

1:31:25.721 --> 1:31:28.655
AND RIGHT IN MY OWN HOMETOWN,
LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,

1:31:28.690 --> 1:31:31.969
TODAY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BEAT UP,
KICKED AROUND,

1:31:32.003 --> 1:31:33.764
PREGNANT WOMEN KNOCKED AROUND

1:31:33.798 --> 1:31:36.732
JUST FOR TRYING TO GET
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE IN.

1:31:36.767 --> 1:31:39.701
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY?

1:31:39.735 --> 1:31:42.048
BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER
HEARD THE TRUTH,

1:31:42.082 --> 1:31:44.015
AND TRUTH MAKES YOU FREE.

1:31:44.050 --> 1:31:46.397
CAN'T YOU LOOK AT ME
AND TELL THAT I'M FREE?

1:31:46.431 --> 1:31:48.537
CAN'T YOU HEAR THE WAY
I TALK AND SEE THAT I'M FREE?

1:31:48.572 --> 1:31:50.953
I DON'T HAVE NO BOSSES.

1:31:50.988 --> 1:31:52.748
I HAVE ONE BOSS,
AND THIS IS HIM,

1:31:52.783 --> 1:31:55.061
THE HONORABLE ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

1:31:55.095 --> 1:31:59.099
IN APRIL 1968,
"ESQUIRE" MAGAZINE PUT ALI

1:31:59.134 --> 1:32:02.620
ON ITS COVER, PORTRAYING
THE EXILED BOXER

1:32:02.655 --> 1:32:06.521
AS ST. SEBASTIAN,
A CHRISTIAN MARTYR PERSECUTED

1:32:06.555 --> 1:32:09.558
FOR HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

1:32:09.593 --> 1:32:11.491
YOU HAVE TO BE SICK
MENTALLY TO WANT TO FORCE

1:32:11.526 --> 1:32:13.148
YOURSELF INTO PLACES
WHERE YOU'RE NOT WANTED.

1:32:13.182 --> 1:32:14.770
YOU SEE THE MAN HATE YOU.

1:32:14.805 --> 1:32:16.772
YOU SEE THEY DON'T
WANT YOU DOWN THERE.

1:32:16.807 --> 1:32:18.394
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE?
WE'LL GO ON SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1:32:18.429 --> 1:32:20.396
YOU BECAME CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD,

1:32:20.431 --> 1:32:21.812
EVERYBODY THOUGHT.
"THIS IS A REFRESHING
YOUNG MAN."

1:32:21.846 --> 1:32:23.572
WE FOUND OUT
YOU WERE A MUSLIM,

1:32:23.607 --> 1:32:24.780
AND PEOPLE GOT SCARED.

1:32:24.815 --> 1:32:26.092
I GOT BAD
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

1:32:26.126 --> 1:32:27.472
I WAS A GOOD BOY
WHEN I WAS HOLLERING,

1:32:27.507 --> 1:32:28.819
"I AM THE GREATEST!

1:32:28.853 --> 1:32:30.821
"I CANNOT BE BEAT!

1:32:30.855 --> 1:32:33.858
I AM PRETTY!
I'M THE KING! HEE HEE HEE!"

1:32:33.893 --> 1:32:36.102
I WAS A GOOD BOY,

1:32:36.136 --> 1:32:37.759
BUT WHEN I SAID,
"I'M A MUSLIM,

1:32:37.793 --> 1:32:39.968
MY RELIGION IS ISLAM,"
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

1:32:40.002 --> 1:32:41.590
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW

1:32:41.625 --> 1:32:43.661
AS ONE OF THE PROMINENT
BLACK PERSONS?

1:32:43.696 --> 1:32:46.077
I CAN'T BE A LEADER,
BUT I CAN TELL THEM
ABOUT THE LEADER.

1:32:46.112 --> 1:32:48.701
ALL I CAN TELL THEM IS TO
JOIN ONTO THEIR OWN KIND,

1:32:48.735 --> 1:32:50.150
ACCEPT THEIR OWN KIND.

1:32:50.185 --> 1:32:52.601
JOIN ONTO THEIR TRUE
RELIGION, WHICH IS ISLAM.

1:32:52.636 --> 1:32:55.190
JOIN ONTO THE MUSLIM TEACHINGS,
WHICH IS TAUGHT TO US

1:32:55.224 --> 1:32:57.088
BY THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

1:32:57.123 --> 1:32:58.952
THE ONLIEST BLACK MAN
PREACHING THE TRUTH
TO BLACK PEOPLE.

1:32:58.987 --> 1:33:00.471
CLEAN UP YOUR OWN
NEIGHBORHOODS

1:33:00.505 --> 1:33:01.921
AND DO SOMETHING
FOR YOURSELF.

1:33:01.955 --> 1:33:04.648
QUIT BEGGING TO INTEGRATE
AND BEG TO SEPARATE.

1:33:04.682 --> 1:33:06.926
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH WHITES.

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:07.996
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE.

1:33:08.030 --> 1:33:09.894
NO, I'M UNCOMFORTABLE. UH...

1:33:09.929 --> 1:33:11.482
ARE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH ME RIGHT NOW?

1:33:11.516 --> 1:33:12.863
NO, I'M COMFORTABLE.

1:33:12.897 --> 1:33:14.968
I'M REAL COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU BECAUSE I KNOW

1:33:15.003 --> 1:33:16.452
HOW FAR TO GO WITH YOU.

1:33:16.487 --> 1:33:17.661
I'M NOT GOING TO GO HOME
WITH YOU NOW

1:33:17.695 --> 1:33:19.007
AND FLIRT
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

1:33:19.041 --> 1:33:20.180
I'M NOT GOING TO TRY
TO PUSH YOU OUT

1:33:20.215 --> 1:33:21.596
OF YOUR SUBURB.

1:33:21.630 --> 1:33:23.114
I INTEGRATE SO FAR.

1:33:23.149 --> 1:33:24.564
SEE, WE DON'T--THAT'S WHY
I LIKE GOVERNOR WALLACE.

1:33:24.599 --> 1:33:25.979
HE TELLS THE TRUTH
ABOUT THINGS.

1:33:26.014 --> 1:33:27.118
YOU LIKE
GEORGE WALLACE?
YES, SIR.

1:33:27.153 --> 1:33:28.741
THAT TRUTH
HE TELLS WE LIKE.

1:33:28.775 --> 1:33:30.018
HE TELLS THE TRUTH.

1:33:30.052 --> 1:33:31.157
YOU BELIEVE THAT?

1:33:31.191 --> 1:33:33.124
I SEE HIM
TELLING THE TRUTH.

1:33:33.159 --> 1:33:35.023
YOU DON'T BELIEVE HE'S
BEEN A TOUGH INFLUENCE

1:33:35.057 --> 1:33:36.680
IN THIS COUNTRY
AND A BAD INFLUENCE?

1:33:36.714 --> 1:33:38.578
WELL, I DON'T AGREE WITH
EVERYTHING NOBODY SAY,

1:33:38.613 --> 1:33:40.753
BUT I LIKE WHAT HE SAY
WHEN HE SAYS THAT NEGROES

1:33:40.787 --> 1:33:42.927
SHOULDN'T FORCE THEMSELVES
INTO WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS

1:33:42.962 --> 1:33:45.102
AND WHITE PEOPLE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO AH MOVE OUT

1:33:45.136 --> 1:33:47.622
OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS
JUST BECAUSE ONE NEGRO COMES.

1:33:47.656 --> 1:33:48.899
THEY DON'T WANT TO SELL
THE HOUSE TO HIM,

1:33:48.933 --> 1:33:50.555
THEY SHOULDN'T,
AND THAT MAKES SENSE.

1:33:50.590 --> 1:33:52.488
IF A PERSON DON'T WANT YOU.
WHY ARE YOU GOING

1:33:52.523 --> 1:33:53.800
TO PUSH YOURSELF ON HIM?

1:33:53.835 --> 1:33:55.664
AND WALLACE IS ADMITTING
THIS AIN'T RIGHT

1:33:55.699 --> 1:33:57.735
AND LET THE PEOPLE DO
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

1:33:57.770 --> 1:33:59.841
WE WANT...WHITE POWER!

1:33:59.875 --> 1:34:02.015
I THINK HIS TALK
ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE

1:34:02.050 --> 1:34:04.569
RACIALLY SEGREGATING
HAS A RESONANCE

1:34:04.604 --> 1:34:08.021
BECAUSE OF THE WHITE BACKLASH
THAT'S OCCURRING

1:34:08.056 --> 1:34:10.610
WITH THIS ATTEMPT
AT INTEGRATION,

1:34:10.645 --> 1:34:11.818
THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE
SAYING, "LOOK.

1:34:11.853 --> 1:34:12.957
"THESE WHITE PEOPLE DON'T
WANT US.

1:34:12.992 --> 1:34:14.925
DO YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?"

1:34:14.959 --> 1:34:16.927
I DON'T EVEN THINK HE EVER
SAW IT IN THAT WAY.

1:34:16.961 --> 1:34:22.553
HE JUST SAW IT AS BLACK PEOPLE,
UM, WANTING TO BECOME PEOPLE

1:34:22.587 --> 1:34:24.935
OUT HERE IN THIS WORLD
THAT MATTERED

1:34:24.969 --> 1:34:27.696
AND THAT THEY--
AND IN ORDER TO MATTER,

1:34:27.731 --> 1:34:29.215
WE HAD TO HAVE OUR OWN LAND,

1:34:29.249 --> 1:34:31.769
AND WE HAD TO BUILD UP
OURSELVES AS A PEOPLE.

1:34:35.186 --> 1:34:38.776
ON APRIL
4, 1968, WHILE STANDING

1:34:38.811 --> 1:34:40.778
ON THE BALCONY
OF THE LORRAINE MOTEL

1:34:40.813 --> 1:34:43.885
IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE,
MARTIN LUTHER KING

1:34:43.919 --> 1:34:45.680
WAS ASSASSINATED.

1:34:50.754 --> 1:34:53.135
"I AM IN MOURNING,"
ALI TOLD THE PRESS,

1:34:53.170 --> 1:34:56.932
"FOR MY BLACK BROTHER."

1:35:26.928 --> 1:35:31.104
IN JUNE, BELINDA
GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY GIRL.

1:35:31.139 --> 1:35:33.244
AT ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S SUGGESTION,

1:35:33.279 --> 1:35:37.870
THEY NAMED HER MARYUM.

1:35:37.904 --> 1:35:41.218
IN AUGUST, A REPORTER
VISITED ALI'S HOME,

1:35:41.252 --> 1:35:45.291
WHERE HE WAS SPENDING SOME
QUIET TIME WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

1:35:45.325 --> 1:35:48.052
HIS LAWYERS HAD JUST FILED
A PETITION ASKING

1:35:48.087 --> 1:35:51.918
THE SUPREME COURT TO
RECONSIDER HIS CONVICTION.

1:35:51.953 --> 1:35:53.920
"I'M NOT AFRAID
TO GO TO JAIL.

1:35:53.955 --> 1:35:55.335
I'M READY TO DIE
FOR MY PEOPLE,"

1:35:55.370 --> 1:35:57.096
HE TOLD THE REPORTER.

1:35:57.130 --> 1:35:59.615
THEN HE PICKED UP MARYUM.

1:35:59.650 --> 1:36:01.859
"YOUR DADDY'S FIGHTING
FOR YOU," HE SAID.

1:36:01.894 --> 1:36:04.275
"SOMEDAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO WALK WITH YOUR HEAD

1:36:04.310 --> 1:36:07.623
"HIGH AND NOT BEG FOR A JOB,

1:36:07.658 --> 1:36:09.902
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT."

1:36:12.249 --> 1:36:15.183
THAT WINTER,
THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

1:36:15.217 --> 1:36:18.255
VOTED PRIVATELY TO REJECT
ALI'S PETITION,

1:36:18.289 --> 1:36:20.188
A DECISION THAT SHOULD HAVE
IMMEDIATELY SENT

1:36:20.222 --> 1:36:22.155
HIM TO PRISON.

1:36:22.190 --> 1:36:25.020
THE CLERK WAS
GOING TO ANNOUNCE TO THE WORLD

1:36:25.055 --> 1:36:26.884
THAT THE CASE HAD BEEN
DENIED REVIEW,

1:36:26.919 --> 1:36:29.818
WHICH WOULD MEAN EVERYTHING'S
OVER, HE'S GOING TO JAIL,

1:36:29.853 --> 1:36:31.682
BUT OVER THE WEEKEND,
A LETTER CAME IN

1:36:31.716 --> 1:36:33.891
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,

1:36:33.926 --> 1:36:38.378
AND THAT LETTER STATED
THAT, UM, THEY HAD RECENTLY

1:36:38.413 --> 1:36:45.178
DISCOVERED THAT MUHAMMAD ALI HAD
BEEN OVERHEARD ON WIRETAPS

1:36:45.213 --> 1:36:47.732
THAT THE GOVERNMENT
HAD BEEN RUNNING

1:36:47.767 --> 1:36:51.150
ON ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
AND ON MARTIN LUTHER KING,

1:36:51.184 --> 1:36:54.981
AND THAT MEANT THAT ALI
WAS ENTITLED TO BE INFORMED

1:36:55.016 --> 1:36:58.019
ABOUT THOSE WIRETAPS
TO SEE WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE

1:36:58.053 --> 1:37:02.851
ANYTHING IN THEM THAT IS
EXCULPATORY TO HIS CASE.

1:37:02.886 --> 1:37:05.681
THE SUPREME COURT SAYS,
"WE ARE SENDING THIS CASE

1:37:05.716 --> 1:37:07.683
"BACK DOWN TO BE REEXAMINED
IN LIGHT

1:37:07.718 --> 1:37:09.375
OF THE WIRETAPPING ISSUE."

1:37:09.409 --> 1:37:13.103
SO AT THE VERY 11th HOUR,
ALI IS MORE OR LESS

1:37:13.137 --> 1:37:17.797
PULLED OUT OF JAIL AND TOLD YOU
CAN START ALL OVER AGAIN.

1:37:17.832 --> 1:37:20.869
IT HAD BEEN TWO YEARS
SINCE ALI'S LAST FIGHT.

1:37:20.904 --> 1:37:22.871
REPORTERS WERE EAGER
TO KNOW IF THIS MEANT

1:37:22.906 --> 1:37:24.804
THAT HE WOULD FIGHT AGAIN.

1:37:24.839 --> 1:37:27.013
"I'M JUST THANKFUL,"
HE TOLD THEM.

1:37:27.048 --> 1:37:30.223
"IT'S ALL IN THE HANDS
OF ALLAH."

1:37:30.258 --> 1:37:32.294
YOU'RE STILL CONTENT,
YOU'RE STILL DETERMINED

1:37:32.329 --> 1:37:34.124
TO RETURN TO THE RING
AND FIGHT ONCE AGAIN

1:37:34.158 --> 1:37:35.470
REGARDLESS
OF WHAT HAPPENS?

1:37:35.504 --> 1:37:37.886
OH, YES, MAINLY TO
PAY BILLS, YOU KNOW.

1:37:37.921 --> 1:37:40.958
THIS IS MY MAIN
MEANING OF LIVELIHOOD,

1:37:40.993 --> 1:37:43.202
AND AH I WOULD
RETURN MAINLY

1:37:43.236 --> 1:37:45.169
TO PAY A LOT
OF UNPAID DEBTS.

1:37:45.204 --> 1:37:47.378
IF THE GOVERNMENT
CLEARED THIS THING UP,
SAY, TONIGHT

1:37:47.413 --> 1:37:49.380
AND YOU COULD FIGHT
A MONTH FROM NOW,

1:37:49.415 --> 1:37:51.762
NAME ME ONE PERSON YOU'D
LIKE TO FIGHT RIGHT AWAY.

1:37:51.796 --> 1:37:52.970
WELL, UH...

1:37:53.005 --> 1:37:54.316
I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN
THEM ALL THESE--

1:37:54.351 --> 1:37:55.870
I'M NOT OUT TO FIGHT
ANY OF THEM REALLY.

1:37:55.904 --> 1:37:57.354
THEY ALL REALLY WANT
TO FIGHT ME BECAUSE

1:37:57.388 --> 1:37:59.252
I CAN'T GAIN
NO PRESTIGE--

1:37:59.287 --> 1:38:00.357
WHICH ONE WOULD MAKE
THE BEST FIGHT,

1:38:00.391 --> 1:38:01.772
AND DRAW
THE BIGGEST CROWD?

1:38:01.806 --> 1:38:03.774
JOE FRAZIER.

1:38:03.808 --> 1:38:06.018
DESPITE HIS EXILE,
MUHAMMAD ALI

1:38:06.052 --> 1:38:08.434
HAD BEEN CLOSELY WATCHING
THE BOXING RANKS,

1:38:08.468 --> 1:38:12.058
WHERE, IN HIS ABSENCE,
JOE FRAZIER WAS NOW RECOGNIZED

1:38:12.093 --> 1:38:15.993
AS THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
IN 5 STATES.

1:38:16.028 --> 1:38:19.410
"IF THE CONVICTION IS
OVERTURNED AND FRAZIER OFFERS,

1:38:19.445 --> 1:38:22.379
I'LL FIGHT," ALI PROMISED.

1:38:22.413 --> 1:38:25.865
BUT ALI'S CLAIM THAT
ANY FIGHT WOULD ONLY BE TO PAY

1:38:25.900 --> 1:38:29.765
OFF HIS DEBTS UNDERCUT
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S TEACHING

1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:33.424
THAT ALLAH WOULD ALWAYS PROVIDE.

1:38:33.459 --> 1:38:36.393
THE NEXT DAY,
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD SUMMONED

1:38:36.427 --> 1:38:39.775
ALI AND BELINDA TO HIS HOME.

1:38:39.810 --> 1:38:42.502
HE SUSPENDED THE FAMILY
FROM THE NATION OF ISLAM

1:38:42.537 --> 1:38:46.334
AND REVOKED MUHAMMAD ALI'S NAME.

1:38:46.368 --> 1:38:48.129
"WE FIGHT FOR OUR FAMILIES,

1:38:48.163 --> 1:38:49.440
"WE FIGHT FOR A LIVING.

1:38:49.475 --> 1:38:51.339
WE DON'T FIGHT FOR MONEY."

1:38:51.373 --> 1:38:54.342
SO IT'S JUST--IT'S JUST
A WAY YOU SAY THINGS,

1:38:54.376 --> 1:38:55.999
AND HE GOT KICKED OUT,

1:38:56.033 --> 1:38:57.379
AND WHEN HE GOT KICKED OUT,
I GOT KICKED OUT

1:38:57.414 --> 1:38:59.554
BECAUSE WE'RE ONE.

1:38:59.588 --> 1:39:01.866
IT WAS TORTURE TO ME

1:39:01.901 --> 1:39:03.351
NOT BEING ABLE TO GO
TO THE MOSQUE,

1:39:03.385 --> 1:39:06.457
NOT BEING ABLE TO GO PRAY
WITH EACH OTHER.

1:39:06.492 --> 1:39:09.081
IN "MUHAMMAD SPEAKS,"
WHICH HAD ONCE

1:39:09.115 --> 1:39:12.015
CELEBRATED THE BOXER
FOR HIS SUCCESS IN THE RING,

1:39:12.049 --> 1:39:14.017
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
NOW CHASTISED HIM

1:39:14.051 --> 1:39:17.054
FOR HIS DESIRE TO FIGHT.

1:39:17.089 --> 1:39:19.574
"CASSIUS CLAY MADE
A COMPLETE FOOL OF HIMSELF

1:39:19.608 --> 1:39:22.266
FOR ACCEPTING THE SPORT
WHICH ALLAH CONDEMNS,"

1:39:22.301 --> 1:39:24.337
THE LEADER WROTE.

1:39:24.372 --> 1:39:27.306
ALI WAS OUTWARDLY REPENTANT.

1:39:27.340 --> 1:39:30.826
"WHAT I SAID WAS OUT
OF PLACE," HE TOLD A REPORTER.

1:39:30.861 --> 1:39:32.414
"HE IS THE BOSS.

1:39:32.449 --> 1:39:35.038
"I WILL BE A MUSLIM
UNTIL THE DAY I DIE.

1:39:35.072 --> 1:39:37.281
"I ONLY PRAY THAT
HE WILL FORGIVE ME

1:39:37.316 --> 1:39:39.490
AND LET ME BACK."

1:39:39.525 --> 1:39:43.011
ALI INSISTED
THAT HE WAS RETIRED.

1:39:43.046 --> 1:39:45.048
"I'LL NEVER CLIMB
INTO THE RING

1:39:45.082 --> 1:39:48.603
OR GO IN AN ARENA AGAIN,"

1:39:48.637 --> 1:39:53.470
BUT HE NEVER STOPPED
PLOTTING HIS RETURN TO BOXING.

1:39:53.504 --> 1:39:57.025
MEANWHILE,
IGNORING HIS OWN FATHER,

1:39:57.060 --> 1:39:59.959
HERBERT MUHAMMAD CONTINUED
TO SEARCH FOR A VENUE

1:39:59.994 --> 1:40:02.444
WHERE THE BOXER
WOULD NOT BE BARRED.

1:40:02.479 --> 1:40:05.137
HE TRIED CITY AFTER CITY.

1:40:05.171 --> 1:40:07.311
NOTHING WORKED OUT.

1:40:07.346 --> 1:40:10.280
THEN ATLANTA BEGAN
TO SHOW PROMISE.

1:40:11.453 --> 1:40:14.974
LEROY JOHNSON, GEORGIA'S
FIRST BLACK STATE SENATOR

1:40:15.009 --> 1:40:17.942
SINCE RECONSTRUCTION,
WAS EAGER TO SEE ALI'S

1:40:17.977 --> 1:40:22.602
FIRST FIGHT IN MORE THAN
3 YEARS COME TO HIS HOMETOWN.

1:40:22.637 --> 1:40:27.262
I WENT TO THE LAW BOOKS
AND BEGAN TO SEARCH THE LAW,

1:40:27.297 --> 1:40:33.096
AND AFTER MAYBE A COUPLE
OF HOURS I DISCOVERED

1:40:33.130 --> 1:40:36.892
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE GEORGIA
STATUTE DEALING

1:40:36.927 --> 1:40:39.309
WITH BOXING MATCHES.

1:40:39.343 --> 1:40:41.932
THAT MEANT IT WAS
LEFT UP TO ATLANTA.

1:40:41.966 --> 1:40:44.417
THE CITY
OF ATLANTA GAVE ITS APPROVAL.

1:40:44.452 --> 1:40:47.248
THE GOVERNOR
OF GEORGIA WASN'T PLEASED.

1:40:47.282 --> 1:40:49.284
I DON'T--I DON'T
SEE HOW THIS FIGHT

1:40:49.319 --> 1:40:52.253
COULD TAKE PLACE REALLY ANYWHERE
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

1:40:52.287 --> 1:40:57.396
BY A MAN THAT HAS DENOUNCED
HIS COUNTRY'S UNIFORM

1:40:57.430 --> 1:41:00.226
AND REFUSED TO BE INDUCTED

1:41:00.261 --> 1:41:02.090
INTO THE SERVICE
OF THIS COUNTRY,

1:41:02.125 --> 1:41:04.368
SO I'VE CALLED FOR A DAY
OF MOURNING BECAUSE OF THIS

1:41:04.403 --> 1:41:06.543
THAT THIS TRAGIC THING
HAS HAPPENED

1:41:06.577 --> 1:41:08.614
IN THIS UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA,

1:41:08.648 --> 1:41:10.409
WHERE MEN HAVE FOUGHT SO LONG

1:41:10.443 --> 1:41:13.998
AND THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
HAVE SACRIFICED SO MUCH.

1:41:14.033 --> 1:41:16.691
BEFORE LEAVING
CHICAGO, ALI RECEIVED

1:41:16.725 --> 1:41:20.108
A PACKAGE CONTAINING
A DECAPITATED BLACK DOG

1:41:20.143 --> 1:41:23.422
AND A NOTE READING,
"WE KNOW HOW TO HANDLE

1:41:23.456 --> 1:41:26.356
BLACK DRAFT-DODGING DOGS
IN GEORGIA."

1:41:28.151 --> 1:41:30.705
TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ATLANTA
COULD STAGE THE BOUT

1:41:30.739 --> 1:41:33.949
WITHOUT POLITICAL
INTERFERENCE OR VIOLENCE,

1:41:33.984 --> 1:41:37.229
SENATOR JOHNSON ARRANGED
FOR A PRE-FIGHT EXHIBITION MATCH

1:41:37.263 --> 1:41:40.301
AT MOREHOUSE COLLEGE.

1:41:40.335 --> 1:41:44.477
ON SEPTEMBER 2, 1970,
2,700 PEOPLE,

1:41:44.512 --> 1:41:47.653
INCLUDING MARTIN LUTHER KING SR.
AND RALPH ABERNATHY,

1:41:47.687 --> 1:41:51.450
FILLED THE MOREHOUSE GYM TO SEE
MUHAMMAD ALI SPAR

1:41:51.484 --> 1:41:54.349
WITH 3 UNDISTINGUISHED
OPPONENTS.

1:41:54.384 --> 1:41:55.695
THE GYM WAS PACKED.

1:41:55.730 --> 1:41:57.594
BLACK AND WHITE WAS THERE,

1:41:57.628 --> 1:42:01.598
AND MOREHOUSE IS IN
THE HEART OF A BLACK COMMUNITY,

1:42:01.632 --> 1:42:05.257
AND THAT SERVED AS
A CUSHION FOR US,

1:42:05.291 --> 1:42:09.606
AND WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL.

1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:13.092
NOBODY TRIED TO INVADE IT
OR STOP THE FIGHT.

1:42:13.127 --> 1:42:15.025
"THE ROOF DID NOT
FALL IN," REPORTED

1:42:15.059 --> 1:42:18.442
"SPORTS ILLUSTRATED,"
"NO ONE THREW A BOMB.

1:42:18.477 --> 1:42:21.376
FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
DID NOT RAIN DOWN."

1:42:22.998 --> 1:42:25.449
SOON AFTER, PROMOTERS
ANNOUNCED THAT ALI

1:42:25.484 --> 1:42:29.488
WOULD BE FIGHTING TOP-RANKED
CONTENDER JERRY QUARRY

1:42:29.522 --> 1:42:33.319
IN ATLANTA ON OCTOBER 26.

1:42:33.354 --> 1:42:35.183
I THINK IT'S FINE,
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE

1:42:35.218 --> 1:42:37.461
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HERE IN ATLANTA.

1:42:37.496 --> 1:42:39.083
I THINK IT'S TIME.

1:42:39.118 --> 1:42:41.155
WELL, I DON'T
LIVE HERE IN ATLANTA,

1:42:41.189 --> 1:42:42.708
BUT FRANKLY I'D JUST
AS SOON HE DIDN'T

1:42:42.742 --> 1:42:44.330
FIGHT ANYWHERE.

1:42:44.365 --> 1:42:45.504
I THINK IT WOULD BE
THE GREATEST THING

1:42:45.538 --> 1:42:47.057
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ATLANTA.

1:42:47.091 --> 1:42:49.404
WELL, I JUST DON'T
LIKE TO SEE OUR--

1:42:49.439 --> 1:42:51.475
US HAVE THAT IN OUR CITY.

1:42:51.510 --> 1:42:53.339
WHY IS THAT?

1:42:55.134 --> 1:42:57.205
JOE FRAZIER'S
MANAGER PROMISED ALI

1:42:57.240 --> 1:43:00.277
A TITLE MATCH
IF HE BEAT QUARRY.

1:43:00.312 --> 1:43:02.486
"WE'LL FIGHT HIM ANYPLACE
IN THE UNITED STATES

1:43:02.521 --> 1:43:05.248
HE CAN GET A LICENSE," HE SAID.

1:43:06.387 --> 1:43:08.596
THOUGH THE BOUT IN ATLANTA
WOULD PROCEED,

1:43:08.630 --> 1:43:12.703
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS STILL BARRED
FROM FIGHTING ANYWHERE ELSE.

1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:20.021
AT THE SAME TIME, LAWYERS
FOR THE NAACP,

1:43:20.055 --> 1:43:23.231
INCLUDING MICHAEL MELTSNER,
HAD FILED A LAWSUIT

1:43:23.266 --> 1:43:26.061
AGAINST NEW YORK'S
BOXING COMMISSION,

1:43:26.096 --> 1:43:29.306
CLAIMING THE COMMISSION
HAD ILLEGALLY SINGLED OUT ALI

1:43:29.341 --> 1:43:33.310
AND GRANTED LICENSES TO OTHER
BOXERS CONVICTED OF CRIMES.

1:43:33.345 --> 1:43:37.038
WE KNEW THAT SOME
LICENSEES HAD CRIMINAL RECORDS,

1:43:37.072 --> 1:43:39.558
BUT WHEN WE GOT INTO THE FILES

1:43:39.592 --> 1:43:44.045
OF THE ATHLETIC COMMISSION,
WE WERE SHOCKED AT THE NUMBERS

1:43:44.079 --> 1:43:47.082
AND THE RANGE
OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES.

1:43:47.117 --> 1:43:52.674
244 BOXERS HAD BEEN LICENSED
BY THE NEW YORK STATE

1:43:52.709 --> 1:43:55.056
ATHLETIC COMMISSION
WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS,

1:43:55.090 --> 1:43:58.542
AND THEY INCLUDED
CHAMPIONS AND CONTENDERS.

1:43:58.577 --> 1:44:01.476
THEY INCLUDED MANSLAUGHTER,
SECOND DEGREE MURDER,

1:44:01.511 --> 1:44:04.617
ARMED ROBBERY, AND THE LIKE.

1:44:04.652 --> 1:44:09.277
IT CONFIRMED OUR SENSE THAT
ALI HAD BEEN PICKED OUT,

1:44:09.312 --> 1:44:12.418
SINGLED OUT,
FOR TREATMENT BECAUSE

1:44:12.453 --> 1:44:15.352
OF HIS IDENTITY, BECAUSE
OF HIS AFFILIATIONS

1:44:15.387 --> 1:44:18.182
WITH THE NATION OF ISLAM,
AND BECAUSE HE WAS

1:44:18.217 --> 1:44:21.289
A PROMINENT BLACK FIGURE.

1:44:21.324 --> 1:44:24.568
JUDGE MANSFIELD SAID,
"THIS IS ARBITRARY.

1:44:24.603 --> 1:44:28.503
IT VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION,
THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE,"

1:44:28.538 --> 1:44:31.437
AND HE REQUIRED THE STATE
OF NEW YORK

1:44:31.472 --> 1:44:34.233
TO GIVE ALI A LICENSE.

1:44:34.268 --> 1:44:38.237
BY THAT TIME, PEOPLE
WERE REALIZING

1:44:38.272 --> 1:44:43.277
WHAT A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE
THAT WHOLE THING HAD BEEN,

1:44:43.311 --> 1:44:46.314
AND JUDGE MANSFIELD'S
DECISION WAS

1:44:46.349 --> 1:44:51.354
THE FIRST JUDICIAL DECISION
ALONG THOSE LINES.

1:44:51.388 --> 1:44:55.150
SO ALI GOT HIS LICENSE
FROM NEW YORK,

1:44:55.185 --> 1:44:58.844
AND AT THAT POINT,
HERBERT CAME TO ME,

1:44:58.878 --> 1:45:02.330
AND HE SAID, "BOB,
FORM A NEW COMPANY

1:45:02.365 --> 1:45:05.782
AND START PROMOTING
ALI'S FIGHTS."

1:45:10.580 --> 1:45:12.409
ONE AFTERNOON
BEFORE HIS MATCH

1:45:12.444 --> 1:45:14.446
WITH JERRY QUARRY IN ATLANTA,

1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:16.620
ALI AND HIS ENTOURAGE
SCREENED A FILM

1:45:16.655 --> 1:45:19.416
ON THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

1:45:19.451 --> 1:45:22.143
JACK JOHNSON,
WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED

1:45:22.177 --> 1:45:24.628
ON RACIALLY MOTIVATED
CHARGES AND FLED

1:45:24.663 --> 1:45:27.528
THE COUNTRY IN 1913.

1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:31.670
"HIS FIGHTS WERE CANCELED, TOO?

1:45:31.704 --> 1:45:34.362
THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING,"
MARVELED ALI.

1:45:34.397 --> 1:45:37.607
"MY CASE REVIVES HIS STORY."

1:45:37.641 --> 1:45:39.471
CLAY, I FEEL, HAS BEEN
MESSED AROUND,

1:45:39.505 --> 1:45:41.576
AND NOW'S THE CHANCE
TO PROVE HIMSELF.

1:45:41.611 --> 1:45:43.337
IF SOMEONE WERE TO
GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY

1:45:43.371 --> 1:45:44.786
TO LET HIM BE HIMSELF,
AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING

1:45:44.821 --> 1:45:47.168
HE'S ASKED FOR
ALL THIS PARTICULAR TIME.

1:45:47.202 --> 1:45:48.583
HE DIDN'T DO
NOTHING NO MORE.

1:45:48.618 --> 1:45:50.240
JUST LET HIM BE HIMSELF.

1:45:50.274 --> 1:45:51.828
I LOVE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY.

1:45:51.862 --> 1:45:54.313
AND THIS WILL
FREE MUHAMMAD.

1:45:54.348 --> 1:45:56.798
THANK YOU.

1:45:56.833 --> 1:46:01.251
ON OCTOBER
26, 1970, MUHAMMAD ALI FOUGHT

1:46:01.285 --> 1:46:04.565
JERRY QUARRY
BEFORE 5,000 SPECTATORS

1:46:04.599 --> 1:46:08.396
AT ATLANTA'S
MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM.

1:46:08.431 --> 1:46:10.709
IT WOULD BE
HIS FIRST PROFESSIONAL FIGHT

1:46:10.743 --> 1:46:13.401
IN MORE THAN 3 1/2 YEARS.

1:46:36.631 --> 1:46:40.428
THAT NIGHT, BUNDINI IS
CONSTANTLY YELLING,

1:46:40.463 --> 1:46:41.774
"GHOST IN THE HOUSE!

1:46:41.809 --> 1:46:43.569
"THERE'S A GHOST IN THE HOUSE!

1:46:43.604 --> 1:46:45.571
GHOST IN THE HOUSE!"

1:46:45.606 --> 1:46:47.573
WELL, THAT GHOST IS,
OF COURSE, THE GHOST

1:46:47.608 --> 1:46:52.544
OF JACK JOHNSON BECAUSE
JACK JOHNSON FOUGHT HIS BATTLES

1:46:52.578 --> 1:46:56.237
AT AN EARLIER TIME
SURROUNDED BY ISSUES

1:46:56.271 --> 1:46:58.964
OF WHAT IT MEANT TO BE
A BLACK MAN IN AMERICA

1:46:58.998 --> 1:47:04.452
IN THE EARLIEST PART
OF THE 20th CENTURY.

1:47:04.487 --> 1:47:09.595
IT IS NOW THE 1970s,
AND IT TURNS OUT MUHAMMAD ALI

1:47:09.630 --> 1:47:12.253
IS FIGHTING A SIMILAR BATTLE.

1:47:12.287 --> 1:47:14.669
SO THE GHOST OF JACK JOHNSON

1:47:14.704 --> 1:47:16.740
IS THE SPIRIT THAT INFORMS

1:47:16.775 --> 1:47:19.881
ALI'S RETURN
AGAINST JERRY QUARRY,

1:47:19.916 --> 1:47:23.333
AND BUNDINI IS THE ONE
WHO GIVES VOICE TO THE FACT

1:47:23.367 --> 1:47:28.683
THAT THIS GHOST IS MOST
INDEED IN THE HOUSE,

1:47:28.718 --> 1:47:33.585
AND ALI FINISHED
IT IN THE RING.

1:47:33.619 --> 1:47:35.966
IN THE THIRD ROUND,
ALI OPENED A GASH

1:47:36.001 --> 1:47:39.453
ABOVE QUARRY'S LEFT EYE.

1:47:39.487 --> 1:47:42.456
THE CUT WAS SO SEVERE THAT
QUARRY'S TRAINER ASKED

1:47:42.490 --> 1:47:46.425
THE REFEREE TO STOP THE FIGHT.

1:47:46.460 --> 1:47:49.635
HE DID, AWARDING ALI
A TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT

1:47:49.670 --> 1:47:53.812
BEFORE THE BELL RANG TO OPEN
THE FOURTH ROUND.

1:47:58.368 --> 1:48:00.059
AFTER THE FIGHT,
CORETTA SCOTT KING

1:48:00.094 --> 1:48:02.959
AND RALPH ABERNATHY
PRESENTED ALI

1:48:02.993 --> 1:48:06.721
WITH A DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING
MEMORIAL AWARD.

1:48:06.756 --> 1:48:09.552
I WANTED TO SAY THAT YOU
ARE NOT ONLY

1:48:09.586 --> 1:48:12.900
OUR CHAMPION IN
THE BOXING AREA,

1:48:12.934 --> 1:48:16.075
BUT YOU ARE ALSO A CHAMPION
OF JUSTICE AND PEACE...

1:48:16.110 --> 1:48:17.491
THANK YOU.
AND HUMAN DIGNITY.

1:48:17.525 --> 1:48:19.527
THANK YOU.

1:48:19.562 --> 1:48:21.011
APPRECIATE IT.

1:48:21.046 --> 1:48:22.599
YOU ARE
THE LIVING EXAMPLE

1:48:22.634 --> 1:48:25.015
OF SOUL POWER.

1:48:25.050 --> 1:48:28.812
THIS WAS THE MARCH
ON WASHINGTON ALL IN TWO FISTS.

1:48:28.847 --> 1:48:32.609
- SO PROUD OF YOU.- SAY IT AGAIN.

1:48:32.644 --> 1:48:35.716
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
MORE THAN 200 VENUES

1:48:35.750 --> 1:48:38.753
HAD CARRIED THE FIGHT
ON CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION,

1:48:38.788 --> 1:48:42.412
INCLUDING NEW YORK CITY'S
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

1:48:42.446 --> 1:48:44.828
"IF THE CROWD AT THE GARDEN
WAS ANY INDICATION,"

1:48:44.863 --> 1:48:47.831
OBSERVED MURRAY CHASS
OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES,"

1:48:47.866 --> 1:48:50.662
"MUHAMMAD ALI COULD BE
ELECTED BOTH GOVERNOR

1:48:50.696 --> 1:48:53.078
"AND UNITED STATES SENATOR
IF HE WERE RUNNING

1:48:53.112 --> 1:48:55.529
IN NEXT TUESDAY'S ELECTION."

1:48:57.392 --> 1:49:01.051
MUHAMMAD ALI'S RETURN
TO THE RING HAD BEEN A TRIUMPH,

1:49:01.086 --> 1:49:04.020
BUT HIS FUTURE
REMAINED UNCERTAIN.

1:49:04.054 --> 1:49:07.092
THOUGH DETERMINED TO REGAIN
THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE,

1:49:07.126 --> 1:49:11.717
ALI STILL FACED 5 YEARS IN
PRISON ON DRAFT EVASION CHARGES,

1:49:11.752 --> 1:49:18.966
AND HIS LENGTHY EXILE HAD
NOT COME WITHOUT A COST.

1:49:21.658 --> 1:49:24.903
AFTER THE QUARRY FIGHT,
I REMEMBER LEAVING THE RING,

1:49:24.937 --> 1:49:26.767
LEAVING THE RINGSIDE
THAT NIGHT,

1:49:26.801 --> 1:49:28.769
WALKING WITH BUD SCHULBERG,
WHO KNEW A WHOLE LOT MORE

1:49:28.803 --> 1:49:31.426
ABOUT BOXING THAN I DID,
AND SCHULBERG'S ONLY COMMENT

1:49:31.461 --> 1:49:33.946
ON THE FIGHT WAS,
"HE'S LOST A STEP."

1:49:35.810 --> 1:49:37.985
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE
MUHAMMAD ALI AND YOU'VE

1:49:38.019 --> 1:49:42.437
MADE YOUR CAREER BY STAYING ONE
STEP AHEAD OF EVERYBODY,

1:49:42.472 --> 1:49:44.163
YOU CAN'T LOSE A STEP.
