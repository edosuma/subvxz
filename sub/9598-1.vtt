02:11.685 --> 02:15.371
That is a very vivid dream.

02:15.381 --> 02:16.636
Yeah. What do you think it means?

02:16.673 --> 02:18.808
<i>Probably nothing.</i>

02:18.809 --> 02:21.154
Though the physical changes
that your body is going through

02:21.161 --> 02:24.130
can enhance any underlying
emotional instability.

02:24.164 --> 02:27.600
So, you're saying that I'm
nervous about having the baby?

02:27.634 --> 02:31.971
I would be.
Look, you're pregnant.

02:32.006 --> 02:35.475
You know, your body is producing
a cocktail of hormones.

02:35.509 --> 02:38.511
Right now,
human chorionic gonadotropin

02:38.545 --> 02:41.796
is facilitating the production
of estrogen and progesterone.

02:41.843 --> 02:44.874
Estrogen causes breast enlargement.
It's also responsible

02:44.934 --> 02:47.934
for a lack of interest in sex
during pregnancy.

02:47.936 --> 02:49.421
So bigger boobs and no sex?

02:50.470 --> 02:52.271
That's a guy's worst nightmare.

02:52.306 --> 02:55.007
- Oh.
- Mnh-mnh-mnh.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.944
- I will kill you.
- Caffeine bad.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.345
Death worse.

03:00.205 --> 03:03.595
- Maura!
- Let go.

03:05.444 --> 03:08.946
- When are you gonna tell Casey?
- Not today.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.115
I don't even know
how I feel about it yet.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.618
Well, take your time.
It's a very big discussion.

03:15.087 --> 03:17.688
Mmm!
This is good.

03:17.723 --> 03:22.026
- Did you use the sulawesi?
- I hate you.

03:22.060 --> 03:25.029
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Angela.

03:25.088 --> 03:28.524
- Hey.
- Hey, Ma.

03:31.974 --> 03:34.330
What are you so worried about?

03:34.364 --> 03:37.333
You know, what kind of mother you'll be?
How it will affect your work?

03:37.401 --> 03:39.402
No, I'm afraid I'm gonna
turn into my mother.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.270
Oh, well, that's just
free-floating anxiety.

03:41.305 --> 03:44.040
That's not based in any reality.
Don't give in to it.

03:46.276 --> 03:48.010
You look different, Jane.

03:48.045 --> 03:51.336
- Bad sleep.
- New eyeliner.

03:51.370 --> 03:53.304
What's going on?

03:53.339 --> 03:56.474
- Nothing.
- Coffee's good.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.376
Coffee's great.

03:58.410 --> 04:01.412
- You want a cup?
- No, I'm... I'm good.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.548
<i>Tell her.</i>

04:03.582 --> 04:05.583
<i>What, right now?
What are you, nuts? No.</i>

04:05.618 --> 04:09.187
<i>- Why not?
- Because...</i>

04:09.221 --> 04:10.522
Because!

04:10.556 --> 04:13.191
Because of the wonderful
things she does?

04:14.326 --> 04:15.756
What are you two
whispering about?

04:15.763 --> 04:17.613
- Sore throat.
- We're not whispering.

04:17.663 --> 04:19.096
<i>Thank god.</i>

04:21.267 --> 04:23.334
- Rizzoli.
- Isles.

04:23.369 --> 04:26.037
- All right.
- Ma, we gotta go.

04:30.309 --> 04:32.744
Um, you know, you should just...

04:32.778 --> 04:35.948
Ah!
That's nice!

04:36.058 --> 04:39.617
I've been trying to get her
to wear her hair back.

04:39.685 --> 04:42.487
- You should try it.
- Would you get...

04:42.521 --> 04:43.988
What do you call a nightmare

04:44.023 --> 04:45.623
that happens to you
when you're awake?

04:45.658 --> 04:47.392
That couldn't happen.

04:47.426 --> 04:51.396
- Just did. Bye, Ma.
- Bye, girls.

<b>Rizzoli and Isles: A New Day</b>
Season 5 Episode 1
Original Airdate: Jun. 19 2014

05:18.536 --> 05:22.138
Would that be so bad... becoming
a little like your mother?

05:22.173 --> 05:25.108
I mean, nuclear war
is worse, but it's close.

05:25.142 --> 05:27.644
It's terrifying, Maura!

05:27.678 --> 05:31.014
Fear is an essential part of
our survival. It keeps us alert.

05:31.082 --> 05:32.415
Oh, great.
So, no caffeine in the morning.

05:32.450 --> 05:34.651
Just a big old cup of fear.

05:34.719 --> 05:37.287
<i>I happen to think that your mom
was a very great mother.</i>

05:37.321 --> 05:38.555
Well, that's because
you weren't around

05:38.589 --> 05:41.291
- when she was doing the mom-ing.
- Yeah, but I see the result.

05:41.325 --> 05:42.692
And I think that you're gonna take

05:42.760 --> 05:44.528
all the best of what she did
and do it even better.

05:44.595 --> 05:47.097
- I'll try.
- Morning. The victim's...

05:47.164 --> 05:49.332
- Hey, you look different.
- You look good.

05:49.367 --> 05:53.169
- Thanks, I think.
- You're wearing a suit.

05:53.204 --> 05:55.504
- Detectives are observant.
- Who's the woman?

05:55.512 --> 05:57.042
How did you know
the victim was a woman?

05:57.043 --> 05:59.468
I'm talking about you and the
woman you're dressing up for.

05:59.471 --> 06:01.971
Can't a man upgrade his look
without a woman being involved?

06:02.046 --> 06:03.346
I don't think so, no.

06:03.414 --> 06:07.150
Well, usually, the male ornaments
himself to attract a female.

06:07.184 --> 06:09.686
Well, take, for instance,
the sage-grouse or the quetzal.

06:10.755 --> 06:15.025
The victim's Susan Murphy, 38,
multiple stab wounds.

06:15.059 --> 06:16.734
She was out jogging.
Robbery's not a motive.

06:16.761 --> 06:20.297
She had a $20 in her pocket,
credit card, along with I.D.

06:20.331 --> 06:21.565
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:21.599 --> 06:26.102
- Good morning.
- Yes, to you... too.

06:27.371 --> 06:29.306
You are aware
that you've met before?

06:29.373 --> 06:31.308
You look sharp.
New woman?

06:31.375 --> 06:33.076
<i>He says he's upgrading his look.</i>

06:33.110 --> 06:35.345
- I don't believe it.
- What do you think?

06:36.447 --> 06:38.181
She bled out internally.

06:38.215 --> 06:41.117
- It's a vicious attack.
- Maybe a predator?

06:41.152 --> 06:44.454
- Hmm.
- What?

06:44.488 --> 06:46.623
There's a slight crease,
almost a burn, from friction.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.291
<i>Someone holding her wrist?</i>

06:48.326 --> 06:50.460
Well, looks more like something
was ripped off her.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.295
- A bracelet?
- Could be.

06:52.330 --> 06:54.475
- Maura.
- So, it's not about a woman?

06:54.478 --> 06:55.528
<i>Of course it's about a woman.</i>

06:55.529 --> 06:57.429
<i>You don't think
I dressed up for you, do you?</i>

06:57.568 --> 07:00.203
Could that be what left the
mark on the victim's wrist?

07:00.271 --> 07:01.605
It's possible.
What's it from?

07:03.808 --> 07:07.877
No, no. No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.181
Over here!

07:16.246 --> 07:20.449
- She was jogging with her baby.
- The baby's missing.

07:33.413 --> 07:35.715
<i>We're fine.
Don't worry about it.</i>

07:35.749 --> 07:37.717
Okay, Maura, thanks.
Let me know what you find.

07:39.186 --> 07:40.586
The divers have
gone through the lake.

07:40.621 --> 07:43.022
Lots of tires and mattresses,
a bowling ball, no baby.

07:43.056 --> 07:44.556
Okay.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.517
They finished the line search
of the woods.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.560
No evidence, no body, nothing.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.435
If you were gonna
kill a mother and her baby,

07:51.465 --> 07:53.195
you'd do it here...
you'd leave the bodies here.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.334
T-taking the bodies away
would just create problems.

07:55.402 --> 07:56.964
You got potential witnesses
who see you

07:56.970 --> 07:58.535
carrying the bodies away, blood trails.

07:58.538 --> 08:02.762
- So, if there's no body...
- Maybe we're looking for a live kid.

08:09.149 --> 08:10.616
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

08:10.651 --> 08:13.653
Brian Murphy. 10 days shy
of his first birthday.

08:15.247 --> 08:16.987
Okay, let's check all
the hospitals and fire stations,

08:16.990 --> 08:18.990
any safe haven where someone
might have turned in a baby.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.575
We did.
No babies last night.

08:20.627 --> 08:22.328
Okay, let's get an amber alert out.

08:22.362 --> 08:24.163
Already done, and we've got
uniforms with Brian's picture

08:24.197 --> 08:26.332
out to all the bus
stations and airports.

08:26.366 --> 08:29.201
Make sure they canvass the area
around the park, all right,

08:29.236 --> 08:31.103
as well as his own neighborhood.
Somebody saw something.

08:31.138 --> 08:32.905
We're talking to everyone, Jane.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.974
Good, 'cause he can't talk to anybody.

08:40.147 --> 08:43.249
What do we have?

08:43.283 --> 08:45.985
Susan Murphy, daughter
of William and Patricia,

08:46.019 --> 08:47.679
<i>local girl born
at Brigham and women's hospital,</i>

08:47.688 --> 08:52.458
<i>grew up right by Fenway Park.
Got a full scholarship to B.C.U.,</i>

08:52.492 --> 08:54.694
<i>where she was
a star cross-country runner</i>

08:54.761 --> 08:56.462
<i>and captain of the track team.</i>

08:56.496 --> 08:59.532
<i>She wrote code
for a software company.</i>

08:59.566 --> 09:03.069
<i>Susan worked from home so
she could take care of her son.</i>

09:03.103 --> 09:04.503
<i>Neighbors say Brian was colicky,</i>

09:04.538 --> 09:06.539
<i>but she ran every night
to help him get to sleep.</i>

09:06.573 --> 09:10.142
- She sounds like a good mom.
- Yeah. She was.

09:11.678 --> 09:13.145
No police record.

09:13.146 --> 09:14.613
<i>Solid citizen.</i>

09:14.648 --> 09:15.648
<i>Well-liked.</i>

09:17.517 --> 09:19.986
- Husband, boyfriend?
- Don't know yet.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.454
Money problems?
Relatives?

09:21.488 --> 09:23.022
Yeah, I-I'm working this thing
as fast as I can.

09:23.056 --> 09:26.993
- Which is not fast.
- Is Detective Frost in?

09:27.027 --> 09:29.428
- No, he's on vacation.
- Oh. When's he coming back?

09:29.496 --> 09:31.097
Uh, he's driving back today.
He'll be in tomorrow.

09:31.164 --> 09:32.231
Can I help you with something?

09:32.265 --> 09:35.434
- I doubt it.
- Well, try me.

09:35.469 --> 09:37.303
Well, the detective's been helping me

09:37.371 --> 09:39.405
organize all my observations and notes

09:39.439 --> 09:41.407
<i>from patrol into a database
which I can cross-reference</i>

09:41.441 --> 09:43.509
<i>with other officers
and update from my phone.</i>

09:43.577 --> 09:47.313
His whole system's so complicated,
I'm afraid to touch it myself.

09:47.347 --> 09:49.181
Any chance you can input these for me?

09:50.350 --> 09:55.121
Uh... it might be better
if Detective Frost handled that himself.

09:55.155 --> 09:57.556
We'll let the detective know
you're looking for him.

09:57.591 --> 10:01.027
- Great. Great. Thanks.
- Sure.

10:01.061 --> 10:04.263
Susan Murphy has a sister in Maine.
She's on her way in.

10:04.297 --> 10:05.631
Susan also has an ex-husband,

10:05.699 --> 10:08.267
and it looks like
the breakup wasn't pretty.

10:08.301 --> 10:11.997
Multiple filings in the case of
Susan Murphy vs. Raymond Murphy.

10:12.125 --> 10:15.797
I guess we need to pay him a visit.

10:18.434 --> 10:21.470
- Hi.
- Hey. What are you giving me?

10:21.504 --> 10:24.773
- Broiled fish with kale.
- For breakfast?

10:24.807 --> 10:27.476
It's very healthy.
I thought you might be hungry.

10:27.510 --> 10:29.778
- Sounds delicious.
- You don't eat anything

10:29.846 --> 10:32.714
- unless it's covered in sugar or grease.
- I've changed my diet.

10:34.450 --> 10:37.753
- Is he seeing a new girl?
- He's upgrading his look.

10:37.787 --> 10:39.921
Oh, he's got a new girl.

10:39.956 --> 10:42.491
- Thanks for the fish.
- Yeah, sure.

10:44.293 --> 10:48.296
- Thanks, Ma.
- Hmm.

10:49.699 --> 10:53.168
Raymond Murphy?
This is Boston police.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.736
Come on, Mr. Murphy, open up.

10:54.771 --> 10:56.838
- We're gonna need a warrant.
- We need to get in there.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.174
Yeah. I'll call Judge o'Connell.
He's fast.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.842
And he liked the Scotch
I sent him for his birthday.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.244
I'll pour him a glass myself

11:02.278 --> 11:03.678
if he can get us a warrant
before noon.

11:06.682 --> 11:09.682
- You know, that doesn't help.
- It makes me feel better.

11:12.075 --> 11:14.575
<i>Oh, come on.
You never get that.</i>

11:15.776 --> 11:16.801
<i>Excuse me.</i>

11:16.819 --> 11:20.000
Raymond Murphy.
Boston police.

11:20.025 --> 11:23.605
Uh... okay, is my truck too close to
hydrant? I thought it was just clear.

11:23.609 --> 11:24.849
No, it's got nothing to do
with your truck.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.287
- Can we talk inside, please?
- What's going on?

11:27.321 --> 11:29.856
- Who are you?
- Caitlin, Ray's girlfriend.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.291
Is something wrong?

11:32.426 --> 11:37.397
<i>- Susan's dead?
- Oh, my god.</i>

11:37.465 --> 11:38.798
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

11:38.833 --> 11:41.868
W-why? Who would
want to hurt Susan?

11:41.902 --> 11:46.673
Mr. Murphy, I have to ask.
We saw all the filings of your divorce.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.576
- It seemed pretty...
- Contentious.

11:49.610 --> 11:51.745
It was a divorce.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.413
And, yes, it was bad.
Aren't they all?

11:53.447 --> 11:58.585
Wait. You think I killed Susan
because we got divorced?

11:58.653 --> 12:01.154
That doesn't make any sense.

12:01.222 --> 12:04.691
I moved on with Caitlin.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.293
Wait a minute.
Where's Brian?

12:06.360 --> 12:08.210
- Mr. Murphy...
- Is he at the station?

12:08.212 --> 12:09.527
- W-wha... who's taking care of him?
- Take a seat.

12:09.530 --> 12:10.664
Please, just tell me
where my son is!

12:10.731 --> 12:13.900
- We don't know.
- Please sit down.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.935
We have every available
officer out looking for him.

12:20.875 --> 12:23.243
Why don't you tell us
where you were last night?

12:23.277 --> 12:26.446
- Me? Why?
- They need an alibi.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.647
For me?!
I-I told you that I don't...

12:27.682 --> 12:29.316
T-they're just doing their job.

12:29.383 --> 12:31.785
We, um... we took
the mass pike out to Chicopee

12:31.819 --> 12:33.787
- to visit Ray's mom.
- The toll road.

12:33.821 --> 12:38.458
- You have an e-zpass?
- Yeah. My mom has dementia.

12:38.526 --> 12:41.328
She's in a memory-care
facility... Evergreen.

12:41.362 --> 12:44.831
- So they'll have a record of your visit?
- No.

12:44.899 --> 12:47.567
A truck overturned
down near Springfield.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.802
We sat in traffic forever.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.705
By the time we got to Chicopee,
visiting hours were over.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.344
Can you think of anyone
who would want to harm Susan?

12:57.378 --> 13:00.580
Susan? No. No.

13:00.648 --> 13:03.283
And how would you describe
your relationship with her?

13:05.386 --> 13:07.854
We got past all the lawyers
and figuring out the alimony.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.356
W-we were fine.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.893
She was a great mom.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.263
Okay, then.

13:17.298 --> 13:19.899
Uh, there are some techs
that are on their way over.

13:19.934 --> 13:23.503
They'll be here to monitor the phones
in case someone calls for ransom.

13:23.537 --> 13:26.840
Ransom?
Y-you think someone might...

13:26.874 --> 13:28.124
We're exploring all options.

13:28.127 --> 13:29.407
Wait a minute.
I want to help find Brian.

13:29.410 --> 13:31.945
I-I can help search for him
or make phone calls or fliers or...

13:31.979 --> 13:33.584
We're looking everywhere, okay?

13:33.589 --> 13:35.444
If you'd like to come down to
the station to wait for news,

13:35.449 --> 13:37.384
if that makes you feel
better, that's fine.

13:37.418 --> 13:41.588
Yeah, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

13:49.996 --> 13:54.734
- Lungs sustained repeated punctures.
- How's it going?

13:54.769 --> 13:57.003
- Slow.
- I can't do slow.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.705
Well, I'm not asking you to.

13:58.773 --> 14:00.306
- That's cute.
- Maura, come on.

14:00.341 --> 14:04.411
This is really important that I...
it's really...

14:05.613 --> 14:09.416
- Jane, are you all right?
- Are you using some...

14:09.450 --> 14:14.320
new, powerful,
super-smelly chemicals in here?

14:14.355 --> 14:15.688
Uh, no.
Same as usual.

14:17.425 --> 14:19.359
Sink! Sink!

14:23.731 --> 14:27.700
Oh, god.
I'm turning into frost.

14:27.735 --> 14:29.335
You know, your heightened
level of estrogen

14:29.370 --> 14:31.571
produces an increased
sensitivity to strong odors.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.873
It's an evolutionary adaptation
to ensure

14:33.908 --> 14:36.443
the mother doesn't ingest toxins
that could harm the baby.

14:37.511 --> 14:40.447
- Okay, what have you found out?
- Let's step outside.

14:40.481 --> 14:41.915
No, no, no, I'm...
I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.017
No, you won't be if I
have to wet-mop my floor.

14:44.084 --> 14:48.488
- Want some water?
- Um... no, no.

14:48.522 --> 14:50.890
Um, just tell me about the autopsy.

14:50.925 --> 14:54.461
Well, it was a rageful attack...
17 stab wounds.

14:54.528 --> 14:57.997
Hmm. Uh, any physical evidence
to link us to the attacker?

14:58.032 --> 15:00.967
Nothing yet, though there is
a possible sexual element

15:01.001 --> 15:02.469
to the stab penetrations.

15:02.503 --> 15:04.604
Sometimes they indicate
an attacker who's impotent

15:04.638 --> 15:07.474
or otherwise incapable
of having intercourse.

15:07.508 --> 15:10.477
Hmm.
I mean, I was thinking

15:10.478 --> 15:13.580
that someone killed Susan
to steal her baby,

15:13.614 --> 15:15.548
but maybe the murder
was only about Susan.

15:15.583 --> 15:18.351
Well, someone could have taken
the baby after she was dead.

15:19.653 --> 15:23.022
This is hard for you, isn't it,
just looking for a missing baby?

15:23.057 --> 15:25.825
- Mm, of course it is.
- No, I-I mean harder because...

15:25.860 --> 15:30.029
Yes, Maura.
And I need to find Brian.

15:30.064 --> 15:32.398
And I can't find Brian
until I find the killer.

15:32.433 --> 15:33.900
And I can't find the killer...

15:33.934 --> 15:38.505
- Until I finish the autopsy.
- Right.

15:38.572 --> 15:40.406
Well, I would love to,
but I keep getting interrupted.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.942
Jane. Uh, there's
something you need to see

15:42.977 --> 15:44.444
on the sex-offender registry.

15:44.478 --> 15:45.545
Okay, I'll be right up.

15:45.579 --> 15:50.683
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hey.

15:52.586 --> 15:53.653
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:55.989 --> 15:59.192
Four "hey" s?
What the hell was that?

16:01.128 --> 16:03.129
<i>I smell something, Maura.</i>

16:03.163 --> 16:06.199
<i>And it has nothing to do with hormones!</i>

16:12.106 --> 16:13.673
What do you got?

16:13.707 --> 16:15.867
This is a map of the
neighborhood around Baxter Park.

16:15.902 --> 16:17.777
- Mm-hmm.
- Show her.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.575
And these are
all the pedophiles around it.

16:20.610 --> 16:23.149
- You got to be kidding.
- I wish.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.048
All right.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.992
- Talk to them... talk to all of them.
- Well, that's a lot of people.

16:26.996 --> 16:29.196
I can narrow it down.
The playground Susan

16:29.197 --> 16:31.539
took Brian to every day
is in Baxter Park.

16:31.564 --> 16:34.284
It's also where she handed Brian
over to Ray on visitation days.

16:34.287 --> 16:36.162
<i>I checked for suspicious
activity around the playground.</i>

16:36.163 --> 16:37.697
A nervous mom reported a man

16:37.731 --> 16:39.966
taking pictures of children
in the park four times.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.901
Well, you can't be in that
playground without a child.

16:41.936 --> 16:43.169
Especially not this guy.

16:44.471 --> 16:48.340
Who happens to live across
the street from Baxter Park.

17:02.207 --> 17:05.357
- Okay, 5A. Yeah.
- That's it.

17:09.175 --> 17:12.019
- Boston police!
- Freeze!

17:20.623 --> 17:22.357
Why are you doing this?

17:22.391 --> 17:24.459
You're a pedophile
living near a playground.

17:24.526 --> 17:28.897
I was convicted of an offense
or two many years ago,

17:28.931 --> 17:30.598
but I served my time.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.552
One of the conditions of
your probation is that you not

17:33.553 --> 17:36.471
live within 500 yards of a
gathering place for children.

17:36.505 --> 17:39.365
That playground was built
two years ago.

17:39.370 --> 17:41.700
I have lived in
the same apartment for 16.

17:41.707 --> 17:43.692
I'm grandfathered
into the neighborhood.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.109
We'll see how your probation
officer feels about that.

17:46.134 --> 17:49.426
He retired. His replacement
never contacted me.

17:49.451 --> 17:51.718
Explain this.

17:53.122 --> 17:55.657
Well, it's not finished yet,
so don't judge the quality.

17:55.691 --> 17:59.661
It needs music and a trim where
his mother is changing him.

17:59.695 --> 18:01.729
Or a close-up.

18:01.797 --> 18:03.498
- You know...
- Lose the attitude,

18:03.532 --> 18:04.832
or lose your freedom, all right?

18:04.900 --> 18:08.069
It's my job.
People bring me a box of tapes.

18:08.103 --> 18:10.505
I create a wonderful movie
of their child's early years.

18:10.572 --> 18:14.609
It's a very valuable service
and a good living.

18:14.643 --> 18:16.711
Who hired you to make
the DVD of Brian?

18:16.779 --> 18:20.381
His mother.
I was to deliver it on his birthday.

18:20.449 --> 18:22.483
- And where did you meet his mother?
- In Baxter Park.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.652
- I gave her my card.
- Where were you last night?

18:24.687 --> 18:26.888
A client asked for
some last-minute changes

18:26.922 --> 18:28.756
to a birthday video for his daughter.

18:28.791 --> 18:31.893
I was with him
in my apartment until 11:00.

18:31.961 --> 18:33.528
We're gonna need
the name of your client.

18:33.595 --> 18:36.631
Rob Brown.
He'll speak very highly of me.

18:36.665 --> 18:41.636
He's a repeat client.
I've... done all of his children.

18:42.471 --> 18:43.838
<i>Mnh-mnh,
mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh.</i>

18:50.153 --> 18:53.081
- Mr. Murphy.
- Yeah?

18:53.115 --> 18:57.118
- Have you seen this man before?
- No.

18:57.186 --> 19:00.054
- Okay.
- W-wait a minute. Is this the guy?

19:00.122 --> 19:02.662
- Right now, he's just someone we're talking to.
- Look, don't bullshit me!

19:02.666 --> 19:03.891
- Is this the guy that took my son?!
- Mr. Murphy. Mr. Murphy.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.793
- Is this the guy?!
- Mr. Murphy.

19:05.828 --> 19:07.853
- Please, just tell me, is this the guy?!
- Mr. Murphy!

19:07.855 --> 19:09.655
I need to you to calm down.

19:09.727 --> 19:13.127
My son is missing.
You know what that's like?

19:13.218 --> 19:15.019
No, I don't.

19:16.472 --> 19:18.573
But I can imagine it's horrible.

19:22.845 --> 19:25.747
Right now, we're doing
everything we can to find Brian.

19:25.781 --> 19:30.098
But if we have to take care of you,
that takes us away from the search.

19:30.133 --> 19:31.466
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:31.501 --> 19:34.122
- Sorry.
- N-no, just give me a minute.

19:36.892 --> 19:39.627
Wait here.

19:42.631 --> 19:44.766
- Where's Jane?
- Interrogation room

19:44.800 --> 19:46.768
with a pedophile
who lives near the park.

19:46.912 --> 19:49.113
Okay, uh, can you tell her
to come down to autopsy

19:49.148 --> 19:51.883
- when she's done?
- Absolutely.

19:54.686 --> 19:59.485
- We need to talk about our kiss.
- Yes, we do.

19:59.691 --> 20:02.793
- It can never happen again.
- And it won't.

20:02.828 --> 20:06.330
I'm sorry, but...
you're like a sister to me.

20:06.398 --> 20:07.798
I am so happy
that you feel that way.

20:07.866 --> 20:10.301
Because you are
like a brother to me...

20:10.335 --> 20:13.771
- with really soft lips.
- Well, not as soft as yours.

20:13.805 --> 20:17.308
- I use a moisturizing lip balm.
- Isn't that cheating?

20:17.376 --> 20:20.845
- The point is...
- I know.

20:21.029 --> 20:22.997
Me too.

20:23.031 --> 20:25.599
I'll tell Jane
you were looking for her.

20:25.634 --> 20:28.969
- Yeah. Thanks.
- All right.

20:32.407 --> 20:34.542
Okay, this is ridiculous.

20:34.576 --> 20:37.178
I have been nothing
but patient and cooperative.

20:37.245 --> 20:38.979
Mr. Robbins, we cannot let you go.

20:39.014 --> 20:43.384
- Then I need to speak to an at...
- Look. We broke your door down.

20:43.452 --> 20:44.852
I'm gonna send
someone over to fix it.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.587
You shouldn't be inconvenienced.

20:48.990 --> 20:52.493
Well, that... that's, uh,
very kind of you.

20:52.527 --> 20:55.096
Can I get you a cup of coffee
while we wait?

20:55.163 --> 20:59.200
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

21:06.041 --> 21:09.510
Thank god you're in here
and not in there.

21:09.544 --> 21:13.147
Just... did the autopsy smell
follow you in here?

21:13.181 --> 21:15.516
No, but your hormones did.
Jane, you should...

21:15.550 --> 21:18.018
I don't have a freaking clue
where Brian is.

21:18.053 --> 21:20.321
Nobody's seen anything.
There's no physical evidence

21:20.389 --> 21:22.223
- to tell us anything about the murderer.
- Jane...

21:22.257 --> 21:23.832
All I've got is
this creep in interrogation,

21:23.833 --> 21:26.009
- and I don't think he took Brian.
- Okay, I think that you should...

21:26.010 --> 21:28.463
And if his alibi checks out,
then I'm back to square one

21:28.488 --> 21:30.933
- with every known pedophile in Boston.
- Jane.

21:30.934 --> 21:33.202
You're interrupting me a lot!

21:34.403 --> 21:36.303
Okay, your turn.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.706
Chasing pedophiles
like the guy you have upstairs

21:38.740 --> 21:41.475
- isn't going to help you.
- Why not?

21:41.510 --> 21:43.244
The killer was a woman.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.568
How sure are you about this?

21:50.602 --> 21:54.772
- On a scale of one to Alpha Centauri?
- If you have to.

21:54.807 --> 21:59.944
- About a block from Alpha Centauri.
- That's very sure.

22:00.012 --> 22:03.748
Look... the wounds are too shallow
to penetrate the rib cage.

22:03.782 --> 22:05.750
The killer didn't have a lot of
upper body strength.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.552
- Or he just wasn't that strong.
- When Susan turned,

22:07.586 --> 22:09.787
the killer didn't stab her
in the face or the breasts.

22:09.822 --> 22:11.489
That what happens
when the killer's a woman.

22:11.557 --> 22:13.858
Anything else?

22:15.681 --> 22:17.515
This wasn't random.

22:17.549 --> 22:20.651
- What? She knew the killer?
- The attack feels personal.

22:20.686 --> 22:22.854
You know, the two stab wounds
in the back and the first

22:22.855 --> 22:25.022
two in the front were
delivered when she was alive.

22:25.057 --> 22:27.091
There were no wound tracks
for the rest.

22:27.125 --> 22:30.161
She was stabbed 13 times
after she was dead.

22:30.195 --> 22:32.196
So whoever did this hated Susan.

22:39.101 --> 22:42.303
<i>- Is my door fixed?
- We're waiting on the locksmith.</i>

22:42.337 --> 22:45.973
Um, can you tell me
about Susan Murphy?

22:46.007 --> 22:49.210
I met her in the park.

22:49.277 --> 22:52.179
<i>I gave her my card.
She called, brought tapes.</i>

22:52.214 --> 22:56.810
- I gave her a DVD.
- Did she ever mention

22:56.845 --> 22:59.353
troubles with friends or
any other women at the park?

22:59.388 --> 23:01.756
Didn't seem to have any friends.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.424
As far as I could tell,
her whole life

23:03.458 --> 23:06.193
was about her kid...
and the kid's father.

23:08.130 --> 23:10.898
A lot of shots of the father
in that video.

23:15.270 --> 23:19.807
Would you mind, um... pointing
out Brian's mom for us?

23:26.848 --> 23:29.350
- She's not here.
- You're sure?

23:29.384 --> 23:31.786
Yeah, she was younger
than these women.

23:31.853 --> 23:34.815
She had red hair.
She was pretty.

23:37.926 --> 23:42.863
- Is this her?
- Yeah, that's her.

23:42.898 --> 23:45.032
<i>That's the woman
who ordered the video.</i>

23:45.066 --> 23:46.033
That's Brian's mother.

23:49.838 --> 23:52.740
- Can I go now?
- No.

23:52.774 --> 23:56.043
I have an alibi.
You spoke to my alibi, right?

23:56.077 --> 23:57.445
<i>We sure did.</i>

23:57.479 --> 23:59.880
You're under arrest
for violating parole...

23:59.915 --> 24:01.849
failure of a registered sex offender

24:01.883 --> 24:03.717
to report to his probation officer.

24:03.752 --> 24:06.253
Dave Robbins, you have
the right to remain silent.

24:06.288 --> 24:07.955
You have the right to an attorney.

24:07.989 --> 24:10.491
If you can't afford one, the
court will appoint one for you.

24:10.525 --> 24:14.128
Ray's e-zpass registers
at each toll booth

24:14.162 --> 24:17.398
- from South Boston to Chicopee.
- It's an 87-mile trip.

24:17.432 --> 24:19.834
Well, we got pictures of the car
at four different booths.

24:19.868 --> 24:21.435
Each of their cellphones

24:21.470 --> 24:23.270
pings at towers on the way
to Mrs. Murphy's nursing home,

24:23.305 --> 24:25.506
two within five minutes
of Susan's time of death.

24:25.540 --> 24:29.743
- It's a tight alibi.
- Jane. You got to see this.

24:29.811 --> 24:32.911
Okay.
Uh... check it again.

24:32.948 --> 24:34.703
Check everything...
check their bank accounts.

24:34.704 --> 24:38.400
Look for any unusual transfers.
Maybe they got somebody else involved.

24:42.324 --> 24:44.225
What do you think?
Lover's quarrel?

24:44.259 --> 24:46.927
Yeah, about who's taking the fall.

24:46.995 --> 24:49.063
They wanted Susan dead.

24:49.097 --> 24:51.432
Maybe Ray was feeling squeezed
by the alimony payments.

24:51.466 --> 24:53.267
And what about Brian?
You saw his apartment.

24:53.301 --> 24:56.220
- It's a shrine to the kid.
- With Susan out of the way,

24:56.221 --> 24:58.806
Ray would keep Caitlin, his son,
and the money all to himself.

24:58.874 --> 25:02.977
- Okay, I buy it, but where's Brian?
- I think they put him somewhere.

25:03.011 --> 25:05.446
They had a plan...
kill Susan, keep the baby.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.947
But something went wrong.

25:06.982 --> 25:08.849
If they tell us where he is,
they go to jail.

25:08.917 --> 25:13.376
Jane, Susan's sister is here.
She's downstairs.

25:13.377 --> 25:15.152
I told her we'd call
when you're ready for her.

25:15.179 --> 25:17.279
I'm ready.

25:20.161 --> 25:22.129
<i>I'm sorry.
I know this is difficult.</i>

25:22.163 --> 25:24.832
<i>Just a few more questions.</i>

25:24.866 --> 25:27.067
How was Susan and Ray's
relationship?

25:27.102 --> 25:29.803
Fine.
I mean, the divorce was hard.

25:29.838 --> 25:32.072
But they got
everything worked out...

25:32.140 --> 25:34.341
until Caitlin came along.

25:34.376 --> 25:35.976
And what happened then?

25:36.011 --> 25:39.246
Well, first, Ray started
missing alimony payments.

25:39.281 --> 25:41.115
He promised he'd catch up,

25:41.149 --> 25:42.816
but he just kept falling further behind.

25:42.851 --> 25:45.052
- And the drop-offs.
- Oh, right.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.922
Caitlin was always late
dropping Brian off.

25:47.956 --> 25:50.658
And last week,
she called last-minute,

25:50.692 --> 25:54.995
said that Brian didn't want to
go back to Susan... at all.

25:55.030 --> 25:57.231
T-that's crazy.
He's a baby.

25:57.265 --> 26:00.300
- Right.
- Susan was so upset,

26:00.335 --> 26:03.304
she called her lawyer and said...
she wanted full custody.

26:03.371 --> 26:06.073
Did Ray and Caitlin know
that Susan wanted full custody?

26:06.141 --> 26:07.575
Ray knew.

26:07.609 --> 26:10.277
Um, she'd just hung up with him
when she called me.

26:10.345 --> 26:14.582
Okay. Thank you.
You've both been very helpful.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.250
- Detective Rizzoli.
- Yeah?

26:16.284 --> 26:18.953
You'll call us
when you find my nephew?

26:18.987 --> 26:23.324
You'll be the first call we make, okay?
Hang in there.

26:30.532 --> 26:33.033
- What?
- Smell my perfume.

26:35.503 --> 26:39.573
- You like it?
- Mm-hmm.

26:39.608 --> 26:41.609
It's strong.

26:43.912 --> 26:47.014
No, it's not.

26:48.950 --> 26:50.284
Caitlin MacCarthy.

26:50.352 --> 26:51.952
She had a record as a teen,
but it's sealed.

26:52.020 --> 26:54.188
Some drug problems later,
worked as a stripper.

26:54.222 --> 26:56.457
Hmm, it's the all-american girl.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.459
Susan was right to want to
keep her away from Brian.

26:58.493 --> 27:00.227
A mother's instinct is a powerful thing.

27:00.261 --> 27:04.465
- Yeah, but their alibi still holds.
- You got to see this.

27:04.499 --> 27:07.034
Ray said he and Caitlin
got stuck in traffic for hours

27:07.068 --> 27:08.535
because of an overturned big rig.

27:08.570 --> 27:11.872
- He's lying.
- No, it was a huge mess.

27:11.940 --> 27:14.308
But Ray drives a big-ass
pickup truck from the '90s.

27:14.342 --> 27:15.643
Oh, I had one like that...

27:15.677 --> 27:17.011
fire it up,
back it out of the driveway,

27:17.078 --> 27:18.138
you're down half a tank.

27:18.142 --> 27:19.472
- Exactly. What did you drive?
- Oh, I had...

27:19.473 --> 27:21.174
Click and clack, is there a point?

27:21.282 --> 27:23.517
Even if he started out with
a completely full tank of gas,

27:23.551 --> 27:25.519
with all that idling
with a trip like that...

27:25.553 --> 27:28.489
87 miles out, 87 back...
he'd need gas.

27:28.556 --> 27:31.158
So I checked the times
of his e-zpass stops.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.960
Now, there were
two pings at Sturbridge.

27:32.994 --> 27:35.562
- He got off the pike.
- There's a Chevron at the Sturbridge exit.

27:35.597 --> 27:40.067
We got the security tapes
from last night. Show them.

27:40.101 --> 27:41.068
Okay, freeze that.

27:41.102 --> 27:44.138
- Ray's truck?
- Where's Caitlin?

27:45.674 --> 27:46.940
Fast-forward.

27:48.143 --> 27:51.512
Freeze.

27:51.546 --> 27:53.414
I checked the time code on
the gas-station security tapes

27:53.448 --> 27:55.282
with Ray's cellphone records.

27:55.316 --> 27:57.718
That phone he's talking on
right there...

27:57.752 --> 28:02.690
- it's Caitlin's.
- Ray took Caitlin's phone with him.

28:02.757 --> 28:05.726
He made calls on it to establish
cellphone-tower pings as an alibi.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.062
So, Caitlin doesn't
have an alibi

28:08.096 --> 28:09.751
because she stayed in Boston
and killed Susan.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.566
Nice work, runt.

28:18.657 --> 28:21.459
- There's nothing.
- Nothing?

28:21.493 --> 28:23.995
No forensics tie Caitlin
to the crime scene.

28:24.029 --> 28:26.397
That is one smart stripper.

28:26.431 --> 28:28.566
You know, a lot of women
work as strippers

28:28.600 --> 28:30.234
to get themselves through college?

28:30.269 --> 28:32.534
Which isn't so strange given
the cost of higher education.

28:32.539 --> 28:35.212
- Maura.
- Well, I'm not advocating for the lifestyle.

28:35.237 --> 28:36.937
Although I do envy
anyone who works at a place

28:36.981 --> 28:39.981
- where five-inch heels are required.
- Maura, focus.

28:40.078 --> 28:42.580
Right. Yes. I'm here.

28:42.614 --> 28:45.483
We have no forensics.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.954
But Caitlin wouldn't
hurt Brian, you know?

28:49.988 --> 28:51.422
I mean, she introduced herself
as his mother.

28:51.456 --> 28:54.692
Maybe she left him with a friend.

28:54.726 --> 28:57.328
No, there'd be too many
questions after Susan's death.

28:57.396 --> 29:01.098
Caitlin put him someplace
where he'd be found.

29:01.133 --> 29:04.035
- Ray and Caitlin thought he'd be safe.
- But he's not.

29:04.069 --> 29:07.546
Maybe...
I don't know.

29:07.581 --> 29:09.307
He's a baby.
Who's looking out for him?

29:10.341 --> 29:11.909
You are.

29:16.381 --> 29:18.316
What's going on?
Have you found Brian?

29:18.350 --> 29:20.618
No. Uh, but we have
some new ideas.

29:20.652 --> 29:23.955
I...
it is... really hot in here.

29:23.989 --> 29:27.592
I'm sorry about that.
Um... here.

29:28.997 --> 29:30.194
- I'll get us some water, okay?
- Yeah.

29:30.229 --> 29:32.196
Just hang tight.

29:32.361 --> 29:34.729
I thought you were gonna break him.

29:34.796 --> 29:37.598
That's exactly what I'm doing.

29:40.769 --> 29:42.603
Why am I here?

29:42.671 --> 29:44.505
Because you killed Susan Murphy.

29:44.539 --> 29:45.873
What?

29:45.941 --> 29:47.641
I was on the mass pike
on my way to Chicopee!

29:47.676 --> 29:48.876
Your phone was on the mass pike.

29:48.910 --> 29:52.780
- You were in Boston in Baxter Park.
- I was sleeping in the backseat.

29:52.814 --> 29:55.216
Or maybe you were in Boston
in Baxter Park.

29:56.818 --> 30:00.821
It's Brian that I'm thinking about.
You left him somewhere,

30:00.856 --> 30:04.740
<i>thinking he'd be found
or turned in or taken care of.</i>

30:04.775 --> 30:06.460
But he hasn't been!

30:06.495 --> 30:08.295
Where did you leave him, Caitlin?!

30:08.330 --> 30:11.326
- Ask the person who killed Susan.
- I am!

30:15.237 --> 30:17.238
I want a lawyer.

30:29.250 --> 30:32.253
Angela.
What a lovely surprise.

30:32.287 --> 30:33.721
- Hello.
- No, no.

30:33.755 --> 30:37.958
What? Is something...
something wrong?

30:37.993 --> 30:40.961
Why are yo..

30:42.664 --> 30:47.368
I-I must say, this is
striking me as slightly odd.

30:47.402 --> 30:51.405
<i>Et non dico
mendacium quaestiones.</i>

30:51.440 --> 30:52.706
That's latin.

30:52.741 --> 30:56.944
"Ask me no questions.
I'll tell you no lies."

30:56.978 --> 30:58.712
I wasn't sure what that meant.

30:58.747 --> 31:01.682
My grandmother,
Maria Maddalena Mazzone,

31:01.716 --> 31:04.752
used to say it before
she read people's minds.

31:04.786 --> 31:08.456
- Oh, she was a psychic?
- No, she made dresses.

31:08.490 --> 31:10.825
But she could tell if you were lying

31:10.859 --> 31:13.527
by running her fingers
across the palm lines.

31:13.562 --> 31:15.262
The palmar flexion creases.

31:16.698 --> 31:18.999
Yours are a little sweaty.

31:21.269 --> 31:24.238
Okay, don't worry.
I won't ask you any questions

31:24.306 --> 31:25.940
so you don't have to
tell me any lies.

31:25.974 --> 31:28.442
I know how hard that is for you.

31:30.412 --> 31:33.213
Jane has a secret.

31:36.418 --> 31:38.919
Maura, she's glowing.

31:38.954 --> 31:40.488
She's not drinking any coffee,

31:40.555 --> 31:43.620
and we know that her blood
is 63% caffeine.

31:45.961 --> 31:49.430
Your palmar flexion creases
are talking to me.

31:49.464 --> 31:52.466
Well, they can't actually be talking.

31:52.501 --> 31:55.970
I knew it! I knew it!
Jane's pregnant!

31:56.004 --> 31:58.405
Wait!
I didn't even say anything!

31:58.473 --> 32:00.474
Yes, youid, loud and clear.

32:00.509 --> 32:02.921
No, no, no. Ange...
Angela, please. She will kill me.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.603
You cannot tell Jane
that you heard this from me.

32:04.605 --> 32:06.541
You have to
let her tell you herself.

32:06.769 --> 32:08.199
Of course.

32:08.208 --> 32:09.708
You will?
Y-y-you will wait?

32:09.718 --> 32:14.124
Yeah, sure, no problem.
I can keep a secret.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.828
I knew it!

32:20.862 --> 32:25.432
<i>I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!</i>

32:27.636 --> 32:30.671
- Have you found Brian?
- No.

32:31.973 --> 32:33.507
And I'll tell you why.

32:35.343 --> 32:39.847
Because Caitlin stabbed
Susan and took Brian.

32:39.881 --> 32:44.018
And she left him someplace safe
where he'd be found quickly.

32:44.052 --> 32:47.688
It was a good plan.

32:47.722 --> 32:50.624
Only we figured it out, and
now you're going to jail, Ray.

32:50.659 --> 32:53.894
The only question is whether or not

32:53.929 --> 32:57.498
Brian will be alive to visit you
when he's grown up.

33:03.772 --> 33:10.711
It is 58 degrees in here.
It's getting dark outside.

33:10.745 --> 33:13.981
The temperature is dropping.
It's supposed to hit 49.

33:15.784 --> 33:18.752
<i>That's cold.</i>

33:18.787 --> 33:22.356
<i>And your son, Brian...</i>

33:22.390 --> 33:25.359
your baby...

33:25.393 --> 33:28.762
is out there somewhere...

33:28.797 --> 33:30.130
alone.

33:32.968 --> 33:35.903
Tell me where Caitlin put Brian.

33:38.773 --> 33:40.741
Ray, I know you don't
want him to die.

33:44.946 --> 33:48.616
Please tell me.

33:52.587 --> 33:54.788
Near St. Ann's.

33:54.823 --> 33:59.026
He's supposed to be at St. Ann's.

34:18.356 --> 34:20.690
No baby has been
brought here for weeks.

34:20.757 --> 34:23.460
It's a very serious event.

34:23.494 --> 34:25.929
The child would become
a ward of the state.

34:25.963 --> 34:28.632
Did anything unusual happen
last night or this morning?

34:28.666 --> 34:32.636
Yes, there was a small theft of...
milk, several quarts.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.120
Do you have any idea who took it?

34:34.123 --> 34:38.039
No... uh, everyone knows where it is.
Uh, we don't lock the pantry.

34:38.063 --> 34:39.302
Has this ever happened before?

34:39.304 --> 34:41.835
Occasionally, we have a problem
with some of the medicines.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.206
But milk?
No. That's... unusual.

34:43.281 --> 34:46.750
Thank you, father.
You've been very helpful.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.353
Uh, detectives.

34:49.387 --> 34:50.954
Uh, I don't want anyone
to get in trouble for this.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.389
I assume that whoever
took the milk needed it,

34:53.424 --> 34:54.858
which is why it's there.

34:54.891 --> 34:56.693
We're not interested
in the milk, father.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.095
We just need to speak
to whoever took it.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.301
<i>So, we're looking for someone</i>

35:04.335 --> 35:07.037
familiar with this
church and this shelter.

35:07.071 --> 35:08.739
And homeless.

35:33.865 --> 35:36.733
- Korsak.
- I see it.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.969
Oh, Boston police.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.737
<i>No, you can keep the milk, all right?</i>

35:40.772 --> 35:42.406
<i>Just tell us where you got it.</i>

35:42.440 --> 35:44.408
Teri. She's my friend.

35:44.442 --> 35:46.076
Look, can you describe her for us?

35:46.110 --> 35:49.379
She's wearing a red hat.
She was a looker in her day.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.515
- So she's older?
- Yeah.

35:51.549 --> 35:53.316
Where does Teri go
when she's not at St. Ann's?

35:53.351 --> 35:58.517
- She camps out in Baxter Park.
- Okay, thanks.

35:59.387 --> 36:03.799
This is gonna be your
home for tonight, little angel,

36:03.800 --> 36:07.459
and then, tomorrow
we'll take a bus to Vermont.

36:07.486 --> 36:10.925
Yes, I have a friend there
who has a nice, warm room.

36:11.250 --> 36:14.118
<i>Oh, that's a good boy.
That's a good boy.</i>

36:14.270 --> 36:16.971
Okay, now.
You're gonna need this.

36:17.006 --> 36:21.209
I know. It's kind of cold.
I'm gonna fix it up for you.

36:21.243 --> 36:26.348
<i>There you go.
Yes. Here you go.</i>

36:26.382 --> 36:28.016
<i>Come on, little angel.</i>

36:28.084 --> 36:32.220
Now, don't go anywhere.
Don't go anywhere

36:32.288 --> 36:34.289
'cause aunt Teri's
gonna be right back, sweetie.

36:34.323 --> 36:37.659
Oh.
Just stay right here.

36:37.693 --> 36:39.527
Stay right here.

36:45.568 --> 36:49.037
<i>- Teri!
- Has anybody seen Teri?</i>

36:49.105 --> 36:50.271
<i>Do you know a Teri?</i>

36:50.306 --> 36:52.140
<i>- Someone named Teri?
- Teri!</i>

36:52.208 --> 36:53.408
Teri, Boston police.

36:55.778 --> 36:59.748
Teri, Boston police!
Has anyone seen Teri?

36:59.782 --> 37:03.284
- Red hat!
- Teri, you're not in trouble!

37:03.352 --> 37:04.352
Don't run!

37:08.724 --> 37:09.991
Teri, we're here to help.
Teri, Teri.

37:10.025 --> 37:13.128
No, please.
Don't hurt the baby.

37:14.764 --> 37:19.300
<i>Hey! Hey, bud!</i>

37:19.335 --> 37:20.668
Come here.

37:20.736 --> 37:22.270
Hey.
Come on. Come on.

37:22.304 --> 37:26.441
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

37:26.475 --> 37:30.612
Hush, angel.
Hey. Hey, baby.

37:30.646 --> 37:33.047
Hi, baby.

37:33.082 --> 37:36.326
I found him at the church.
He was all alone.

37:36.436 --> 37:38.668
He was gonna freeze if I left him.

37:38.750 --> 37:42.726
You kept him save and warm.
You did good.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.494
<i>Hey, sweet boy.</i>

37:44.529 --> 37:46.596
<i>Hi, sweet boy.
Oh, my goodness.</i>

37:46.664 --> 37:49.799
- Oh, my goodness.
- He's an angel.

37:57.555 --> 37:59.523
- Where are you taking my client?
- Not far.

37:59.557 --> 38:01.858
Caitlin MacCarthy,
this is Officer Jenkins.

38:01.893 --> 38:03.860
You're under arrest
for the murder of Susan Murphy

38:03.895 --> 38:05.228
and the kidnapping of Brian Murphy.

38:05.296 --> 38:07.491
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say

38:07.492 --> 38:09.933
<i>can and will be used against you
in a court of law.</i>

38:09.968 --> 38:11.368
<i>You have the right
to consult an attorney...</i>

38:11.402 --> 38:13.070
All done with Ray?

38:13.137 --> 38:17.107
Yeah, he's in holding,
waiting for his lawyer.

38:17.175 --> 38:19.409
You know, you see Ray
and Caitlin on the street...

38:19.444 --> 38:20.877
they look like good people.

38:20.912 --> 38:22.279
They look like
they'd be great parents.

38:22.313 --> 38:23.880
You see Teri on the street...

38:23.948 --> 38:25.582
you wouldn't want her
anywhere near your kid.

38:25.616 --> 38:27.084
Both cases, you'd be wrong.

38:27.118 --> 38:28.483
You never know
who's gonna be a good parent

38:28.486 --> 38:30.420
till it's time for them to do the job.

38:30.455 --> 38:33.323
- Yeah.
- Detective!

38:35.660 --> 38:37.294
We're on our way home.

38:37.328 --> 38:39.162
Everything go okay with
child protective services?

38:39.197 --> 38:42.199
We have temporary guardianship,
and the rest is in the works.

38:42.233 --> 38:45.702
- Thank you so much for everything.
- Sure. I'll see you at the trial.

38:51.209 --> 38:53.410
Julia?

38:53.444 --> 38:56.913
Is it... is it okay if I...
say goodbye to Brian?

38:56.948 --> 38:59.449
Oh, yeah, of course.
Here.

38:59.484 --> 39:01.084
Look at that.

39:01.119 --> 39:03.854
Oh, my goodness.
Look at you.

39:03.888 --> 39:07.124
Oh, come here.
Oh, precious.

39:07.158 --> 39:10.193
This is the lady that saved you.

39:12.997 --> 39:16.200
- She'll be a good mom someday.
- Jane?

39:16.234 --> 39:19.870
All that loving with your new girl
has got your brain scrambled.

39:19.904 --> 39:21.972
She's not a girl.
She's a woman.

39:22.040 --> 39:27.177
- Kiki is... my life coach.
- Ki... Kiki?

39:27.212 --> 39:30.472
- What kind of name is Kiki?
- It's short for Catherine.

39:30.473 --> 39:32.013
And why do you need a life coach?
Don't you know how to live?

39:32.016 --> 39:33.760
I'm in my third act.

39:33.785 --> 39:35.819
I just want to be sure
I've explored all my options.

39:35.854 --> 39:37.421
Right now, she's got me
studying for lieutenant.

39:37.455 --> 39:39.056
Now, why would you
want to be a lieutenant?

39:39.090 --> 39:40.390
Because I won't have to

39:40.425 --> 39:42.642
answer stupid questions
from detectives.

39:45.997 --> 39:47.164
You guys got a problem?

39:47.198 --> 39:49.132
- No, n-not me.
- Nope. No.

39:53.972 --> 39:57.441
- What?!
- I just wanted to see you.

40:05.710 --> 40:09.273
- Looking good, Vince.
- Thanks, Angela.

40:09.308 --> 40:11.242
Korsak.

40:11.276 --> 40:14.012
- What about me?
- You could dress better.

40:21.754 --> 40:22.754
What?

40:27.493 --> 40:31.396
It's Maura. Frost was driving
back from his mother's.

40:31.430 --> 40:34.213
And there's been an accident.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.701
There's nothing you can do.

41:14.707 --> 41:17.594
<i>There's nothing you can do.
He's gone.</i>
