Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:03.300 --> 00:05.063
(Spencer)
We found a hole
in Sara's closet

00:05.170 --> 00:06.535
in her room at The Radley.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.699
The night Charlotte came home,
the night she was murdered

00:08.800 --> 00:11.633
someone used a |and|in_e from The
Two Crows to call this house.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.378
(Ella)
I'm so glad
we finally told you.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.436
Now we don't have to
sneak around anymore.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.575
Congratulations.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.411
I buried someone
who made my life hell for years.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.080
I'm now being questioned
in her murder. I lost my job.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.215
- Come back to New York with me.
- I can't.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.709
Damian, I came to ask you
if your article is fully about

00:26.820 --> 00:29.050
millennials and politics
or if you have another angle.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.559
The murder weapon
was a golf club.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.491
What Detective Tanner
described was a hollow piece

00:32.600 --> 00:34.556
of metal cut with a rectangle
at the end.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.366
(Caleb)
I've been working with the data
from Yvonne's cell phone.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.030
These are my mom's medical
records. How do they have these?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.698
You and I need to talk
about Ezra Fitz.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.131
Does he know what you're doing?

00:42.240 --> 00:44.504
You wrote this,
big parts of it.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.578
Melissa's suitcase is broken

00:46.680 --> 00:49.171
and there's a part missing
that's metal, hollow

00:49.280 --> 00:51.145
and cut with a rectangle
in the end.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.184
Whoa.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.656
Did she check out
or get hurled out?

00:59.760 --> 01:03.287
This is what the inside of Sara
Harvey's head must look like.

01:03.390 --> 01:06.154
I would have made her lick
the carpet before she left.

01:06.260 --> 01:08.319
Okay, let's show All the closet.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.764
Urgh! Who leaves coleslaw
in the middle of the floor?

01:12.870 --> 01:14.462
Hanna, closet.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.330
(Alison)
'When you asked the front desk'

01:17.440 --> 01:18.509
'did they know
why she left so fast?‘

01:18.610 --> 01:20.202
(Hanna)
'What do you think?‘

01:20.310 --> 01:21.607
She's not racing off
to a Messies Anonymous meeting.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.541
- She knows we're on to her.
- It's gone.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.345
- There's no hole.
- What? That's impossible.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.315
There's not even a seam
where the hole used to be.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.478
Guys, maybe
this wasn't her room.

01:28.580 --> 01:30.480
Don't. Stop cutting
Sara any slack.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.285
Hey, I don't care how much
she claimed to have loved

01:32.390 --> 01:35.086
Charlotte like a sister.
This girl has two faces.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.452
[door opens]

01:36.560 --> 01:37.481
[gaSPSI

01:39.730 --> 01:41.493
- We should leave.
- No.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.568
Look, guys, if my mom finds out
that I used that key card--

01:43.670 --> 01:45.126
We don't have to introduce
ourselves.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.697
We just have to walk
out the door.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.237
Emily, stop.

01:51.340 --> 01:52.637
I'm not leaving
until we can go back down there.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.207
Okay, she doesn't
even believe it exists!

01:54.310 --> 01:55.709
I didn't say that,
I'm just trying to

01:55.810 --> 01:57.368
understand
why she would stalk you.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.401
(Emily)
'Because she thinks
we had something'

01:58.510 --> 01:59.545
'to do with Charlotte's murder.‘

01:59.650 --> 02:01.709
- She thinks we know who did it!
- Shh!

02:06.720 --> 02:08.551
Alright, let's move.

02:25.940 --> 02:30.707
* Got a secret can you keep it
swear this one you'll save *

02:30.810 --> 02:35.747
* Better lock it in your pocket
taking this one to the grave *

02:35.850 --> 02:40.810
* IfI show you then I know
you won't tell what I said *

02:40.920 --> 02:46.222
* 'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead **

02:51.670 --> 02:55.162
- Are you giving up?
- Nope, it's done.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.329
- Seriously?
- The file was corrupted.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.930
If they wanna leak
your mom's medical report

02:59.040 --> 03:01.406
they're gonna have to break
into her doctor's office again.

03:01.510 --> 03:02.841
And you're sure that
nobody in the Phillips camp

03:02.950 --> 03:04.269
could ever trace
this back to you?

03:04.380 --> 03:06.245
No way, I mean,
they might find an exit node

03:06.350 --> 03:08.375
but they'll never figure out
where it originated.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.448
The anonymizer software
disseminates traffic

03:10.550 --> 03:12.859
through multiple sources and..

03:12.960 --> 03:14.655
Did I just put you to sleep?

03:14.760 --> 03:15.715
No, no, I'm not.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.629
I, Ijust..

03:17.730 --> 03:20.324
I don't really think that
this is just gonna go away.

03:20.430 --> 03:21.692
You know, my mom
could still be ambushed

03:21.800 --> 03:23.199
right before the election.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.427
You're right,
but if you tell her that

03:25.530 --> 03:26.963
then she's gonna wanna know
how you learned about her

03:27.070 --> 03:29.334
being sick,
and you open that box..

03:30.710 --> 03:33.201
Hey, let's make you
some breakfast.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.504
You need protein.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.249
Fingernails can only supply
so much.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.942
When did you see me
chew my fingernails?

03:39.050 --> 03:40.847
In your sleep.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.281
You went after mine first.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.812
- No.
- Yes.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.282
Hey.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.221
Emily, hey, come in.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.298
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, you're not.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.265
- Uh, you hungry?
- I can't stay.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.759
I've got to get to
the bursar's office at Hollis.

03:58.870 --> 04:00.792
What's wrong?

04:00.900 --> 04:02.606
Can you go back down with me?

04:02.710 --> 04:03.904
We'll find another way
to get down there.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.500
- Emily, stop.
- I know.

04:05.610 --> 04:07.373
But if Sara Harvey
is hiding under the hotel

04:07.480 --> 04:08.777
what is she planning next?

04:08.880 --> 04:10.768
Don't do this to yourself, okay?

04:10.880 --> 04:13.019
She may have had nothing to do
with the fertility clinic.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.519
She's just playing on your fear.

04:14.620 --> 04:15.769
Yeah, well, it's workin'.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.246
Okay, it's not like
someone stole my chapstick.

04:18.350 --> 04:19.954
This person may be storing
my future offspring

04:20.060 --> 04:21.482
in a Styrofoam cooler.

04:21.590 --> 04:23.387
And if the police don't
come up with a suspect soon

04:23.490 --> 04:24.821
then Sara's gonna think
we're withholding information.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.251
Okay, but we're not
withholding anything.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.392
Wh-what was that look?

04:32.500 --> 04:34.593
You guys know something.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.668
- Oh, what?
- No, we know nothing.

04:41.680 --> 04:45.571
- Melissa's suitcase is broken.
- What?

04:45.680 --> 04:47.614
The pull-up handle
is missing a rod.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.688
It could've been used as a
weapon to crack someone's neck.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.485
Okay, can we please
not go there?

04:51.590 --> 04:52.852
Melissa wasn't _even in town
the night

04:52.960 --> 04:53.915
that Charlotte was murdered.

04:54.020 --> 04:55.556
Are you sure about that?

04:55.660 --> 04:57.321
Emily, my mother's election
is two weeks away.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.829
- I get it, but if Melissa had--
- What?

04:58.930 --> 05:00.921
Never wanted to watch Charlotte
walk the streets again?

05:01.030 --> 05:03.567
I mean, that pretty much
covers everyone who loves us.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.888
Should we add your mom
to that suspect list too?

05:07.100 --> 05:08.863
(Aria)
I don't know how to handle this.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.369
- You have to tell him.
- How?

05:10.470 --> 05:12.779
Liam, he spent the last week
pounding out chapters.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.529
But if he ships them to Boston
before you speak to him--

05:14.640 --> 05:15.971
He won't. _
He wants to speak to me first.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.604
He wants feedback.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.411
Did you sleep at all last night?

05:20.520 --> 05:21.646
I'll sleep when I'm unemployed.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.718
- Okay.
- Jillian's gonna fire me.

05:23.820 --> 05:26.687
Or give you a book contract.
She loved what you wrote.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.348
Because she thought
that Ezra wrote it.

05:28.460 --> 05:29.950
Okay, one step at a time.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.880
First, tell the author.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.821
Hopefully, he'll be...f|attered.

05:33.930 --> 05:36.467
- Flattered?
- Then he'll call our boss.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.561
Tell her he's had an epiphany
and he wants

05:38.670 --> 05:39.898
to take the story
in another direction.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.558
I think the word is betrayed.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.661
Aria, two weeks ago, this dude

05:43.770 --> 05:45.738
was pouring rum
on his corn flakes.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.502
He's luclq that someone who once
sat in the back of his classroom

05:48.610 --> 05:50.874
actually cares enough
to save his reputation.

05:50.980 --> 05:53.346
It's-it's not that simple.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.754
[sighs]
I'm gonna tell him
this afternoon.

06:01.890 --> 06:03.881
This hasn't even hit
the stores yet.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.753
I called in a favor.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.350
It's lovely. Silk?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.465
Yeah, and if you want, you can
pair it with that beaded bolero

06:10.570 --> 06:12.868
unless you think that's
too mother-of—the-bride.

06:12.970 --> 06:14.665
This mother is a bride.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.761
Did you bring all of these
back from New York?

06:16.870 --> 06:18.667
'Yeah, I tried
to grab everything'

06:18.770 --> 06:20.533
without running
into my former boss.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.699
[cell phone rings]

06:24.650 --> 06:26.072
- You can get that.
- Oh, no.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.648
- It's Jordan. He'll call back.
- No, please, answer It.

06:28.750 --> 06:31.048
I mean, I feel guilty
that I'm making you do all this

06:31.150 --> 06:32.117
when you have your own wedding--

06:32.220 --> 06:34.051
No, this is work.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.481
And you're doing this now.

06:36.590 --> 06:38.581
We haven't even set a date yet.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.920
So, umm, do you wanna
try something on

06:41.030 --> 06:42.429
or did I totally strike out?

06:42.530 --> 06:45.465
No, no, not at all.
You did a fabulous job.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.735
It's just when Byron and I
first got married

06:49.840 --> 06:53.970
umm, we were very determined
not be traditional.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.729
So we rented a barn

06:55.840 --> 06:58.149
and we basically dressed up
like cowhands.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.548
[chuckles]
Well, that's cute.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.687
- I mean, I love theme weddings.
- It wasn't a theme.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.782
It was just two cynical
college kids with no money

07:06.890 --> 07:09.688
and a skewed sense
of what was romantic.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.849
We made my mom sit on a keg.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.848
Ugh! What did she wear?

07:13.960 --> 07:17.566
This time, I wanna feel
like more of a bride

07:17.670 --> 07:20.594
and I wanna feel elegant.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.737
- I can do elegant.
- I know you can.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.434
Can you show me what
you've picked out for yourself

07:26.540 --> 07:27.768
or is that a state secret?

07:27.880 --> 07:30.098
Uh, no, I mean,
I-I haven't even thought

07:30.210 --> 07:31.541
about what I'm gonna wear.

07:31.650 --> 07:33.140
Seriously?

07:33.250 --> 07:34.717
And your mom already sent out

07:34.820 --> 07:36.481
shower invitations
and you haven't--

07:36.590 --> 07:38.581
You know what?
Give me till the end of the day.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.510
I know the dress.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.964
So sorry to bother.
Can I borrow a pen?

07:58.070 --> 07:59.799
What? Oh, sure.

07:59.910 --> 08:00.877
Thanks.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.572
Can I also borrow $1000?

08:03.950 --> 08:06.009
[chuckles]
I'm luclq ifI have enough left
to buy a single textbook.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.249
[chuckles]

08:08.350 --> 08:11.478
_ Hold it.
You taking Intro To Psych?

08:11.590 --> 08:13.148
- Yeah.
- Me too.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.479
You know, the professor's
supposed to be a real trip.

08:16.590 --> 08:17.887
He's actually giving
a lecture tonight.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.855
I was thinking about going
and asking a few questions

08:19.960 --> 08:22.622
just so I can start off
on his good side.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.095
You wanna join?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.599
I-I'll run my questions past you

08:25.700 --> 08:27.236
so I don't sound
like the village idiot.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.932
You free?

08:29.040 --> 08:30.928
Umm, yeah.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.769
Cool. I'm Damian.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.972
Emily.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.502
Hey, when did you get back?

08:39.620 --> 08:41.645
- Just now.
- How did it go?

08:41.750 --> 08:43.115
Fine, I guess.

08:43.220 --> 08:45.848
I need a long hot shower.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.113
Whose suitcase is that?

08:50.260 --> 08:51.522
Mine.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.188
What happened to your other one?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.927
It was broken.
I tossed it.

08:58.970 --> 09:02.736
- Good morning.
- It was until I opened my eyes.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.307
Do you have time for a coffee?

09:04.410 --> 09:06.264
Oh, honey,
I've already had a pot.

09:06.370 --> 09:09.840
Oh, jeez, Gil,
not the Shriners.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.269
We're supposed to be
hitting up new voters

09:11.380 --> 09:13.541
not resuscitating the dead.

09:15.050 --> 09:17.018
What's going on?
You look like a kid

09:17.120 --> 09:18.917
who just dropped her sucker
in the sand.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.279
- Honey, what is it?
- You should have told us.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.756
Told you what?

09:25.860 --> 09:27.828
That the cancer came back.

09:30.130 --> 09:31.825
You kept it from us once

09:31.930 --> 09:33.932
when you promised us that
that would never happen again.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.338
The prognosis was good,
so there was no reason--

09:36.440 --> 09:38.032
There's every reason, mom.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.698
I am not _
one of your constituents.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.675
I'm gonna be fine, Spencer.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.103
How did you find out about this?

09:44.210 --> 09:46.178
That doesn't even matter,
but ifI know

09:46.280 --> 09:48.669
you can bet that your opponent's
camp knows as well.

09:48.780 --> 09:49.883
What do they know?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.582
The doctors gave me
a clean bill of health.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.248
They supported
my bid for office.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.157
How about letting me
support you?

09:58.790 --> 10:02.089
Look, I was planning on
telling you and Melissa

10:02.200 --> 10:04.327
after the election.

10:04.430 --> 10:08.161
But Gil, he, he begged me
not to share this.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.669
It would, it would

10:09.770 --> 10:11.738
scare off the voters,
hijack the platform.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.308
It would be all that
anyone would ever ask me about.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.002
So what if they did?

10:17.810 --> 10:20.643
Mom, I work on Capitol Hill.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.945
I know all of the traps.

10:23.050 --> 10:26.144
But you're running on a platform
based on transparency

10:26.250 --> 10:28.081
and integrity.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.283
Do not set yourself up
to be blindsided

10:30.390 --> 10:32.756
once you get into the office.

10:32.860 --> 10:35.954
You know, you were the one
who taught me

10:36.060 --> 10:38.699
that courage is all about
having grace under fire.

10:42.270 --> 10:45.103
I mean, it doesn't really
get harder than this.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.008
You're right.

10:51.110 --> 10:53.169
Thank you for reminding me
why I did this.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.847
Mom, you're gonna make
a great senator.

10:57.950 --> 10:58.939
No.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.983
I meant whyI had kids.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.929
You get the chance to make
people better than yourself.

11:11.430 --> 11:12.988
I love you.

11:19.310 --> 11:20.868
[cell phone beeps]

11:39.230 --> 11:43.223
Do you wanna send that back,
order something else?

11:43.330 --> 11:44.922
Hmm?

11:45.030 --> 11:46.964
Oh, no, no. It's tasty.

11:49.300 --> 11:53.805
Listen, uh, okay, so your mother
and I have this crazy idea.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.003
Uh, we were thinking how great
it would be

11:56.110 --> 12:00.274
if we were actually married
by someone who really knew us.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.938
Like you.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.249
What?

12:05.350 --> 12:08.717
Dad, I can't officiate your
wedding. I'm not a minister.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.128
Well, no, wait,
that's the easy part.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.925
You can just get
a license online.

12:12.030 --> 12:13.395
I mean, we would still
have to be recognized

12:13.500 --> 12:14.922
by the state
for the ceremony--

12:15.030 --> 12:17.498
Dad, seriously,
you don't want me to do that.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.865
Why not? You are the writer
in this family.

12:23.470 --> 12:24.835
[clears throat]

12:26.040 --> 12:28.338
Okay, listen,
there's no pressure, okay?

12:28.440 --> 12:31.375
It was just this crazy idea
that your mom and I have.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.744
It's not that I don't want to.

12:33.850 --> 12:36.785
I just, I don't want Mike
to feel left out or anything.

12:37.850 --> 12:40.318
Oh...don't worry about Mike.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.987
Your brother's not coming.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.259
Why? Why, I thought he said
he was gonna try to--

12:46.360 --> 12:49.193
I just think he's not,
not so happy about this.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.995
That is insane.
Why wouldn't he want

12:51.100 --> 12:53.534
you and mom to be back together?

12:53.640 --> 12:57.303
Possibly because he has never
forgiven me for why we broke up.

12:58.970 --> 13:01.768
He doesn't trust
that I won't hurt her again.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.768
Well, it's his loss

13:06.880 --> 13:09.212
because it's gonna be
a very special day.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.081
I'll work on _
the ceremony tonight.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.059
She got her first text.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.048
Wait, so now this freak thinks
that Alison's hiding

13:19.160 --> 13:21.094
something about the murder too?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.929
That doesn't even make sense.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.464
Well, if it is Sara Harvey,
she's probably furious

13:25.570 --> 13:27.265
that Alison's talking
to us again.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.000
Why is Melissa just sitting
there in her car?

13:34.280 --> 13:35.975
Okay.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.048
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:44.150 --> 13:46.414
Turns out my trip
was a huge success.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.351
Polls show a 12% gain.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.985
I'm more persuasive
than I thought.

13:51.090 --> 13:53.297
Hail to the conqueror.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.095
Hey, do you, umm, have that

13:55.200 --> 13:56.895
luggage tag
on your old suitcase?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.228
Gil said you really need
to submit it if you want--

13:58.330 --> 14:00.264
Forget about it.
The trip's already paid for.

14:00.370 --> 14:03.237
Put the funds
toward mom's victory party.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.161
Hey, umm, how did you
break your suitcase?

14:06.270 --> 14:08.238
- What?
- I told him about it.

14:08.340 --> 14:11.901
'Cause he just really
likes to fix things.

14:12.010 --> 14:13.978
What makes you assume
I broke it?

14:14.080 --> 14:16.378
Well, when did you notice
it was broken?

14:16.480 --> 14:19.449
When I pulled it out of the cab
from the Philly airport.

14:19.550 --> 14:22.155
The idiot took every bumpy,
potholed street

14:22.260 --> 14:23.887
to avoid baseball traffic.

14:25.190 --> 14:27.351
- Have a nice walk.
- Bye.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.891
I know what you're gonna say.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.865
Well, then I won't say it.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.400
Say it.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.570
Your sister got back into town
two Saturdays ago.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.170
- Right?
-Mmm.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.077
The Phillies had
an away game that day

14:45.180 --> 14:48.411
so that traffic would've
been in Baltimore.

14:50.950 --> 14:54.454
Please don't be silent.
Just talk this through with me.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.348
Aria, it's done. You've already
submitted six chapters.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.495
Did Jillian like it?
Was she pleased?

15:06.670 --> 15:09.138
Kinda, yeah.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.901
On a scale Of one to ten

15:11.010 --> 15:12.659
ten being very pleased,
over the moon--

15:12.770 --> 15:14.169
- Ezra--
- I need a number.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.044
Nine, eight and a half, I..

15:17.150 --> 15:19.300
Eight and a quarter.

15:19.410 --> 15:20.570
She had notes.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.910
Did she?
And was I receptive?

15:23.020 --> 15:26.012
Ezra, I will go
to my boss on Monday

15:26.120 --> 15:27.417
and I will tell her the truth.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.010
Aria, you can't do that.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.326
She'll kick you to the curb.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.421
How could she even
trust you again?

15:32.530 --> 15:34.020
It's what it is.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.189
No, it isn't.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.523
I know you were trying
to protect me.

15:39.630 --> 15:41.166
You saw that
I was falling apart

15:41.270 --> 15:43.135
and you assumed the worst.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.128
You thought the jury would
hand down a lighter sentence

15:45.240 --> 15:48.209
ifI wrote a painful
and gripping story

15:48.310 --> 15:51.108
which also has all the makings
of a great romantic novel

15:51.210 --> 15:53.269
if you wanna write that too.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.486
I can't really tell
if you wanna hug me or punch me.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.252
How can I punch you?
This wasn't a career move.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.420
This-this...was an act of love.

16:12.170 --> 16:15.059
Oh, we-we could
just turn in all of it.

16:16.270 --> 16:19.068
I mean, Dickens was paid
by the inch.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.078
Oh.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.978
Can I just read what you wrote?

16:25.080 --> 16:28.049
It's probably a lot better
than what I have.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.619
(Hanna)
Okay, tell me
you're not in love.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.095
It's gorgeous.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.519
And I got a simple veil
to go with it.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.091
Nothing too insane, but just a
little something to add mystery.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.260
The mystery is how
am I going to walk in it.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.429
I may need to borrow
Emily's legs.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.007
Well, I'll hem it.

16:54.110 --> 16:56.203
You're gonna rock this dress,
I promise.

16:56.310 --> 16:58.369
Please try it on.
Oh, wait.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.516
- What about the veil?
- No, that's okay.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.282
I don't want anything
to detract from the dress.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.109
You did good.
Your work here is done.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.280
What about the tables?

17:08.390 --> 17:11.723
You want them to complement
the dress, right?

17:11.830 --> 17:14.025
Can I please do the tables?

17:14.130 --> 17:15.597
Knock yourself out.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.291
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.288
Go back outside. I don't
want you to see the bride.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.709
- It's bad luck.
- I'm not the groom, Hanna.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.302
I'm the minister
or officiator, whatever.

17:27.410 --> 17:31.039
Well, I'm styling it, so I guess
we'll both be working the party.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.674
Wait, you're gonna be there?

17:32.780 --> 17:34.418
That's weird.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.614
- Why is it weird?
- Because I..

17:37.720 --> 17:41.554
I didn't invite any friends.
I was trying to be sensitive.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.321
Sensitive to what?

17:43.430 --> 17:47.127
Making you sit at a small
wedding with Caleb and Spencer

17:47.230 --> 17:48.322
two feet from the ceremony.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.466
Would you be comfortable
with that?

17:50.570 --> 17:53.539
I have no issue
with Spencer and Caleb, alright?

17:53.640 --> 17:57.599
They're great together and
we're all different people now.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.236
I'm happy for them.
This is happy.

18:09.150 --> 18:12.244
Ali, what is it?

18:13.290 --> 18:15.155
The night that Charlotte
came home..

18:16.860 --> 18:19.420
...we stayed up late talking.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.592
And I told her about us.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.264
She stared at me like a cat.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.389
And then she went upstairs.

18:30.870 --> 18:33.202
I could tell
that she felt betrayed.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.639
I was her doctor.

18:39.450 --> 18:43.238
No, I think she was angry at me.

18:43.350 --> 18:45.409
That's why she ran out
in the middle of the night.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.649
It may not have been
because of a phone call.

18:51.390 --> 18:53.426
I might have delivered
my sister..

18:55.230 --> 18:57.118
...to whoever did that to her.

18:57.230 --> 18:59.164
Alison, th-that's not true.

19:02.370 --> 19:05.862
The person who failed Charlotte
in that moment..

19:05.970 --> 19:07.528
...was me..

19:08.980 --> 19:10.709
...not you.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.141
Hey, how did it go?

19:17.250 --> 19:19.389
Excellent.
I'm now gainfully employed.

19:19.490 --> 19:21.412
Well, at least
until tomorrow night.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.556
I'm starved. _
Do you wanna order In?

19:23.660 --> 19:26.356
Oh, I'm going to a lecture
with a guy from my psych class.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.894
Trying to earn brownie points
with the new professor.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.729
Well, congratulations.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.718
At least one of us will have
a degree that matters.

19:32.830 --> 19:35.663
I enrolled, Hanna, but it's not
like it was four years ago

19:35.770 --> 19:37.567
when the only thing I had
to worry about in freshman year

19:37.670 --> 19:39.729
was catching something
from a communal shower curtain.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.479
- Emily, you're not gonna have--
- Yes, I am, Hanna.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.275
How am I supposed to take notes
when the voice in my head

19:44.380 --> 19:46.177
is telling me that
Sara Harvey is torturing you

19:46.280 --> 19:47.838
for something Melissa
might have done?

19:47.950 --> 19:49.440
Wait, Melissa Hastings?

19:49.550 --> 19:50.881
Melissa might have
called Charlotte

19:50.990 --> 19:52.412
from the diner,
she could've been the one

19:52.520 --> 19:53.748
who lured her out
in the middle of the night--

19:53.860 --> 19:55.555
No, no, no, hold on.
Wasn't Melissa in London?

19:55.660 --> 19:57.548
Spencer thinks so.
Caleb doesn't.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.254
[cell phone rings]

20:01.800 --> 20:03.290
Oh, who's Damian?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.868
Uh, he goes to Hollis.
That's who I'm meeting up with.

20:05.970 --> 20:07.597
- Hey, there.
- 'Hey.'

20:07.700 --> 20:09.964
It's a good thing I got
here early. It's insane.

20:10.070 --> 20:11.731
That line behind me
IS waItIng to get In.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.808
- Can you save me a seat?
- 'Sure.‘

20:13.910 --> 20:15.377
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
you're still coming.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.448
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

20:18.650 --> 20:19.639
He looks familiar.

20:20.580 --> 20:21.569
Did you ever buy
any used books from Hollis?

20:22.480 --> 20:23.742
No, but they did
actually deliver a box

20:23.850 --> 20:25.408
for you this afternoon.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.353
Really?
I haven't ordered any.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.361
Em, what's wrong?

20:42.470 --> 20:44.768
"What To Name The Baby?"
What class is that?

20:48.640 --> 20:50.403
Oh, my God.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.478
What does it say?

21:02.390 --> 21:03.652
I've chosen to share this
With you

21:03.760 --> 21:07.594
because ultimately,
my diagnosis was a wake-up call.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.396
'And I trust _now_
that you have this in5ight'

21:10.500 --> 21:12.798
you'll know that I don't
give up without a fight.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.409
[sighs]

21:24.580 --> 21:26.377
- Hanna, hey.
- Hey.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.846
Hey, uh, did you
get my messages?

21:28.950 --> 21:30.440
No, I'm-I'm so sorry.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.744
I just turned my phone off,
so that I could watch.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.317
Are you okay?

21:35.420 --> 21:37.627
I think Melissa
could have done it.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.948
I saw your sister
years ago in London.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.550
Okay, where are you?

21:41.660 --> 21:43.662
You will never guess
who just talked to me.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.328
Okay, so I was in line
at the bar

21:45.430 --> 21:47.569
and some stranger
just compliments my shoes

21:47.670 --> 21:49.888
and I turn around, it's Claudia
Freakin' Greco, Caleb.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.900
And don't pretend like
you don't know who she is.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.307
I have to go.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.007
Melissa?

21:58.110 --> 21:59.805
Hello, Hanna.

21:59.910 --> 22:02.617
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.984
Well, not in this bathroom,
but nearby.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.739
No, this event.

22:06.850 --> 22:09.455
Fashion Week.
Did you change careers?

22:09.560 --> 22:11.653
I came with a friend
who ditched me

22:11.760 --> 22:14.854
because I've spent the entire
night sobbing into my phone.

22:14.960 --> 22:15.995
Is that drink yours or mine?

22:16.100 --> 22:17.692
Uh, yours.

22:20.700 --> 22:21.997
How's Wren?

22:22.100 --> 22:24.705
He's gone.
He left me.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.335
That scheming nut job who made
your life a living hell

22:27.440 --> 22:29.078
has now moved on
to mess With mine.

22:29.180 --> 22:30.204
You mean Charlotte?

22:30.310 --> 22:34.041
Who the hell gave that
twisted sister phone privileges?

22:34.150 --> 22:35.970
I mean, how does someone
with her resume

22:36.080 --> 22:38.548
get put under penthouse arrest?

22:39.990 --> 22:42.379
I try not to think about her.

22:42.490 --> 22:43.718
You know, forgive and forget.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.481
Yeah, a leopard
doesn't change its spots.

22:47.630 --> 22:49.518
Wait, did she call you?

22:49.630 --> 22:51.120
No, she called Wren

22:51.230 --> 22:53.790
and clearly, she shared
information with him

22:53.900 --> 22:55.765
because he's been looking at me
for the last week

22:55.870 --> 22:57.633
like I should be the one
locked up.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.878
And is that
because of Bethany Young?

23:02.980 --> 23:05.904
If she's willing to tell him,
who else is she gonna tell?

23:09.180 --> 23:11.683
You know,
we all have a past, Hanna.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.588
Aren't you curious what
she plans to use against you?

23:19.660 --> 23:21.799
Here. Why don't we call her
and find out?

23:21.900 --> 23:22.719
Melissa, stop.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.593
Someone needs to shut her up
for good.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.167
Melissa, give me my phone!

23:26.270 --> 23:28.636
I'm doing you a favor.
You'll thank me one day.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.836
Hi, this is Alison DiLaurentis.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.669
Can I please speak
to my sister, Charlotte?

23:33.780 --> 23:35.429
- Give me the phone.
- Well, wake her up.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.405
She has her whole life to nap.

23:37.510 --> 23:38.807
Tell her Hanna wants to say hi.

23:38.910 --> 23:39.877
Melissa, stop.

23:40.780 --> 23:41.519
No, I don't wanna speak
to her doctor.

23:42.280 --> 23:42.974
I wanna speak
to my bloody sister!

23:43.080 --> 23:45.116
Put Charlotte on!

23:45.220 --> 23:47.108
I don't wanna hear her voice!

23:47.220 --> 23:48.687
[glass shatters]

23:50.730 --> 23:53.426
Well, you have a funny way
of forgiving, Hanna.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.428
Why didn't you tell me
about this

23:56.530 --> 23:57.827
when you came home
from that trip?

23:59.100 --> 24:00.533
She didn't want another person

24:00.640 --> 24:02.460
telling her that
she wasn't over it.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.035
Well, neither was your sister.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.707
So can you at least find out

24:08.810 --> 24:10.641
if Melissa called that night
from the diner?

24:14.850 --> 24:16.715
Thanks.

24:16.820 --> 24:19.038
Oh, umm, what was the name

24:19.150 --> 24:21.948
of that snealq blogger dude
from Hollis?

24:22.060 --> 24:23.982
The one who freaked out
you and Melissa?

24:25.730 --> 24:27.823
So what made you decide
to come back?

24:29.260 --> 24:31.490
Here...where you grew up.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.591
What was the,
what was the draw?

24:33.700 --> 24:36.191
Oh, uh, my mom was alone

24:36.300 --> 24:38.109
so I thought it'd be good
to be nearby.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.859
Right.

24:39.970 --> 24:42.234
Hey, do you wanna grab
a cup of coffee in here

24:42.340 --> 24:44.877
and take it across the street?

24:44.980 --> 24:47.540
- Sure. That sounds great.
- Yeah. Great.

24:47.650 --> 24:48.810
[cell phone beeps]

24:58.260 --> 25:00.820
How do you take it?

25:00.930 --> 25:02.124
Your coffee?

25:02.230 --> 25:04.494
You know what?
Let's skip the coffee.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.522
Let's grab dinner instead.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.097
Even better.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.834
Ezra Fitz?

25:13.940 --> 25:16.204
Hi, I'm Liam Greene.
Uh, we met once before.

25:16.310 --> 25:17.504
I work with Aria
at the publishing house.

25:17.610 --> 25:18.747
That's right. Yeah.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.772
Umm, what brings you
to Rosewood?

25:20.880 --> 25:22.643
Aria invited me
to her parents' wedding.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.514
Oh, that's great.
That should be a lot of fun.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.759
In a parents' wedding
sort of way.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.088
Yeah.

25:29.190 --> 25:30.384
I'm actually meeting Aria here.

25:30.490 --> 25:34.221
Umm, she suggested that, uh, we
go over the chapters I gave her.

25:34.330 --> 25:37.788
Oh, well, I'm anxious
to read them myself.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.595
From what I hear,
it's a great plot.

25:39.700 --> 25:42.589
Nice twists.
Strong characters.

25:43.340 --> 25:44.807
Yeah.

25:44.910 --> 25:48.676
Umm, I just wanna
put it out there.

25:48.780 --> 25:50.839
Uh, the protagonist
was inspired by this woman

25:50.950 --> 25:52.941
that I traveled the world with.

25:53.050 --> 25:55.041
Uh, it's not Aria.

25:55.150 --> 25:58.244
Umm, I mean, we never
ventured out past Philly.

25:58.350 --> 26:02.059
And though some can find
romance in the Liberty Bell

26:02.160 --> 26:05.755
umm, I just wanted to say this
so there's no confusion.

26:05.860 --> 26:09.091
If you thought I was writing
about Aria and me, I'm not.

26:12.770 --> 26:15.193
- Hey.
- Oh, look who it is.

26:15.300 --> 26:18.861
Uh, sorry, I'm late,
I was working on the ceremony

26:18.970 --> 26:20.779
and I must have lost
track of time.

26:20.880 --> 26:25.078
Umm, so how long have you
two been sitting here?

26:25.180 --> 26:28.638
Umm, not long,
but I'll leave you two alone.

26:28.750 --> 26:31.514
I'm sure Mr. Fitz is eager
to get his feedback.

26:35.390 --> 26:37.278
Liam.

26:37.390 --> 26:38.982
Liam, wait.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.855
Does Ezra know that you know?

26:42.960 --> 26:45.326
- Know what?
- About me ghostwriting.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.762
No, but at least
now I know that Mr. Fitz

26:47.870 --> 26:50.134
_ was more than
just your favorite teacher.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.606
Is this why you wanted
to stay in Rosewood?

26:56.410 --> 26:58.048
Liam.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.010
Please pick up, pick up.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.889

Hey, Liam, it's me again.

27:12.890 --> 27:15.290
Look, I'm so sorry, okay?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.028
Just.. I-I need a chance
to explain.

27:18.130 --> 27:20.064
Call me.

27:20.170 --> 27:21.865
Oh, but not after 5:00.

27:21.970 --> 27:25.303
I'll...be marrying my parents.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.968
Bye.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.044
- 'Have you eaten today?‘
- I can't remember.

27:34.150 --> 27:36.641
- What day is it?
- It's your wedding day.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.911
You can't be nervous.
You've married Byron before.

27:39.020 --> 27:40.851
'True,
it makes no logical sense'

27:40.960 --> 27:45.249
but when he walks in the room,
it's like I'm 19 again.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.827
God, help me.

27:46.930 --> 27:48.989
Well, I think it's fate.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.921
People who are meant to be
together take a break

27:52.030 --> 27:54.965
and then find their way back
to their first love.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.738
What's more romantic than that?

27:58.840 --> 28:01.400
Oh, Byron wasn't my first love.

28:01.510 --> 28:04.377
His name was Riclq Eichler.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.038
He played the drums

28:06.150 --> 28:08.778
and had green eyes
that you could drown in

28:08.880 --> 28:11.678
and he was sew and badass

28:11.790 --> 28:14.213
and I thought we would
be together forever.

28:16.090 --> 28:18.388
- What happened to him?
- Who knows?

28:18.490 --> 28:21.789
We graduated and we grew up.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.822
[cell phone rings]

28:25.830 --> 28:27.695
I'll call him back.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.153
Is that message for me?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.867
How long are you gonna avoid me?

28:59.970 --> 29:02.336
I'm not avoiding you.
I'm trying--

29:02.440 --> 29:06.900
Alison, I will give you
as much space as you need.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.329
I just don't wanna
be pushed away

29:08.440 --> 29:10.328
because you feel
unnecessary guilt.

29:12.880 --> 29:17.271
I'm...I'm feeling
a lot of things.

29:17.380 --> 29:21.157
Is there any way you can look
at me and not see your sister?

29:22.990 --> 29:25.754
I'm here, Alison.
I'm alive.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.198
And I love you.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.039
And I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.932
What are you saying?

29:42.440 --> 29:45.045
Exactly what you think I said.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.954
(Veronica)
'I mean, Gil said that..'

29:56.320 --> 29:58.925
Hey, I wanted to say
congratulations

29:59.030 --> 30:00.998
but by the time we got home,
you were already asleep.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.193
Oh, it was an exhausting day.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.090
What's wrong?

30:08.200 --> 30:11.067
Apparently, while I was
recording the speech

30:11.170 --> 30:14.139
a story came out
intended to crush my opponent.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.901
Well, that's politics.

some days you're the statue.

30:20.350 --> 30:21.510
Don't be glib.

30:22.650 --> 30:24.186
This could destroy all
the goodwill mom just earned.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.109
How?

30:25.220 --> 30:26.881
Why would anything
about Christine Phillips

30:26.990 --> 30:28.082
affect mom's speech?

30:28.190 --> 30:30.954
It's not about Christine.

30:31.060 --> 30:33.949
- It's about her daughter.
- Yvonne?

30:34.060 --> 30:36.358
Why? What did she do?

30:36.460 --> 30:39.896
She got rid of an unwanted
pregnancy in high school.

was definitely back

before Charlotte was released.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.364
She could have made that call
from the diner.

is either really unpopular

31:19.170 --> 31:22.276
or really closed.

we're with this other person?

with another person

32:24.210 --> 32:26.337

know ourselves?‘

32:26.440 --> 32:29.375

these questions.

32:29.480 --> 32:33.439
They know exactly who they are
and what they want.

32:33.550 --> 32:39.341
As individuals, each of them
is loving, wise and sensitive.

32:39.450 --> 32:41.953
Together, they're more.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.082
They're inspiring.

32:49.230 --> 32:52.097
So here they are together again

to be there

34:21.190 --> 34:22.452
- You don't know that.
- I do.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.323
I made it clear,
if she messes with this family

34:24.430 --> 34:26.182
she's gonna be back underground
breathing through a straw.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.349
Okay, so what?
You think Sara Harvey did this?

34:28.460 --> 34:30.052
[door opens]

34:32.800 --> 34:36.099
Forgive the intrusion, but I
just got off the phone with Gil.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.600
- What did he say?
- Maybe you should come inside.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.803
I am inside.
What did he say?

34:40.910 --> 34:43.105
Christine Phillips
hired an expert

34:43.210 --> 34:44.404
who tracked the source
of the leak.

34:44.510 --> 34:45.545
What is going on?

34:46.510 --> 34:47.704
It was traced back
to your IP address, Spencer.

34:47.810 --> 34:49.072
What?

34:49.180 --> 34:50.317
That doesn't make any sense.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.217
I haven't touched
this laptop all day.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.185
I was with Caleb
watching your speech

34:54.290 --> 34:55.359
on his computer at The Brew--

34:55.460 --> 34:56.609
Spencer, please,
don't lie to me.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.381
You must have hacked
into their system.

34:58.490 --> 34:59.855
That's how you knew
about my diagnosis.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.325
No, mom, that's not how I knew--

35:01.430 --> 35:03.091
No, she didn't do it.

35:03.830 --> 35:05.263
I did it.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.622
I leaked it.

35:08.700 --> 35:09.769
Is that true?

35:09.870 --> 35:11.360
Caleb, why are you saying this?

35:11.470 --> 35:13.267
Do you understand
what this means?

35:13.370 --> 35:14.701
They were prepared
to do the same to you.

35:14.810 --> 35:17.131
1.. Sometimes you need to make
a preemptive strike.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.673
That wasn't your call to make.

35:18.780 --> 35:21.374
Mom, he didn't do this.

35:21.480 --> 35:25.416
Well, you'll need to resign
from this campaign immediately.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.215
And it would
also be wise to gather

35:27.320 --> 35:31.484
your things
and leave here...tonight.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.615
So where are they going
for their honeymoon?

36:36.720 --> 36:40.178
Atlantic City.
My mom had a Groupon.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.827
I'm joking.

36:43.930 --> 36:47.764
It's some dumpy, little motel
on the Jersey Shore

36:47.870 --> 36:50.759
where they spent
a wild college weekend.

36:50.870 --> 36:52.337
Sweet.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.779
Thanks for coming.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.472
I'm glad I did.

36:57.580 --> 36:59.309
It was helpful to hear
what your thoughts are

36:59.410 --> 37:02.709
on true love and...commitment.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.209
I am...so sorry.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.653
I wasn't completely
honest about my..

37:08.760 --> 37:11.479
...history with Ezra.

37:11.590 --> 37:12.784
Okay.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.222
Why did you hold back?

37:20.500 --> 37:23.298
I guess I still wasn't being
completely honest with myself.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.368
It's been..

37:26.040 --> 37:27.701
It's been confusing.

37:28.610 --> 37:30.669
It was pretty clear on the page.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.270
If he's the one
you were writing about--

37:32.380 --> 37:34.439
I wasn't or..

37:34.550 --> 37:36.768
...maybe I was.
I don't know.

37:39.350 --> 37:41.284
Writing those words..

37:42.590 --> 37:46.754
Maybe it...gave me the chance
to work it out.

37:49.660 --> 37:51.423
And have you?

37:53.970 --> 37:56.268
I think so.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.402
How does it end?

38:03.380 --> 38:04.802
I didn't know until right now.

38:04.910 --> 38:10.610
* Take apart this careful mask
I've made *

38:13.620 --> 38:18.523
* Would you care
to offer up your skin *

38:18.630 --> 38:22.350
* So I can breathe again

38:28.840 --> 38:35.302
* Here we go again
back to the starting line *

38:36.980 --> 38:43.317
* Here we go again
saving face and doing time *

38:44.990 --> 38:51.452
* Here we go again
is it your choice or mine *

38:54.130 --> 38:57.952
* Never mind I'm doing fine

38:58.060 --> 39:00.927
Hey, Jordan, sorry,
I haven't called you back.

39:01.030 --> 39:02.998
I've been in full wedding mode.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.364
Well, somebody else's.

39:05.470 --> 39:08.871
But for ours,
I think I picked a date.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.403
How does May 17 sound to you?

39:12.480 --> 39:15.449
Okay, well, umm, call me back.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.745
Oh, and I love you.

39:17.850 --> 39:22.981
* Here we go again
is it your choice or mine *

39:23.090 --> 39:26.355
* Here we go

39:26.460 --> 39:31.625
* Oh never mind I'll be fine *

39:31.730 --> 39:33.994
No. No, you're not leaving.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.637
Please, just go in there
and tell my mother the truth.

39:36.740 --> 39:38.560
Spencer, she's two weeks out.

39:38.670 --> 39:40.706
This is the truth
she needs to win.

39:40.810 --> 39:42.129
If there needs_ to be
a scapegoat, let it be me.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.537
- Not you.
- Caleb--

39:43.640 --> 39:45.039
Hey, I will figure out
who did this.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.710
You need to find out
what Melissa's been up to.

39:47.810 --> 39:49.710
I can cover for one sister
at a time.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.408
Where are you gonna go?

39:53.520 --> 39:55.852
I don't know.
I'll-I'll work it out.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.916
I want you to stay.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.658
I know you do..

40:01.130 --> 40:02.791
...but I can't.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.918
What happened? What is that?

40:22.020 --> 40:23.817
What's left of my phone.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.885
Emily, where were you?

40:26.990 --> 40:28.958
Did you go back to the tunnel?
Did your car break down?

40:29.060 --> 40:31.449
I couldn't even make it
to my car.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.427
And when I did, I was shaking
so much, I could barely drive.

40:35.230 --> 40:37.050
Emily, were you attacked?

40:37.160 --> 40:38.661
Did Sara Harvey come after you?

40:38.770 --> 40:40.499
- I was, but it wasn't her.
- Well, then who?

40:40.600 --> 40:41.737
I don't know.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.694
Sara Harvey wants
this murder solved.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.961
Whoever this was,
they wanna cover it up.

40:46.070 --> 40:47.435
How do you know that?

40:47.540 --> 40:48.802
Because they may have
found the weapon.

40:48.910 --> 40:49.774
What?

40:49.880 --> 40:51.199
They were willing to kill me
to get it back.

40:51.310 --> 40:52.572
So what are you saying?

40:52.680 --> 40:53.942
There's now more than
one person after us?

40:55.520 --> 40:56.839
There's definitely two.

41:16.340 --> 41:18.558
- Hi.
- I told you it was too late.

41:18.670 --> 41:21.104
- She was sleeping.
- They weren't sleeping.

- 'Oh, hi.l
- Hi.

41:23.710 --> 41:26.042
Party's kinda over, guys.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.004
Umm, were you guys looking--

41:28.110 --> 41:30.874
Get married...tonight.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.982
Alison tells me
you're now licensed.

41:35.690 --> 41:37.555
Wait, you wanna get married?

41:37.660 --> 41:39.787
You want me to marry you?

41:39.890 --> 41:41.824
To each other? Right now?

41:41.930 --> 41:43.921
Is English her first language?

41:44.030 --> 41:45.895
Oh, I cannot do that.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.729
Why not?

41:47.830 --> 41:49.639
Your twinkle lights
are still on in your baclqard.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.492
