00:09.300 --> 00:13.096
-I don't know why you're surprised.
-No way divorce is Mom's idea.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.597
-Why not?
-She worships him.

00:14.681 --> 00:18.393
I guarantee, if it was her idea,
it's because he's a narcissist.

00:18.476 --> 00:21.354
There must be more to the story.
Why do you think it's his fault?

00:21.438 --> 00:24.024
-Why are you defending my dad?
-Not trying to.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.193
All I'm saying
is there might be another explanation.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.029
-You just don't know about it.
-I'm not gonna hold my breath.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.658
I hope this apple fell far from the tree.

00:33.742 --> 00:37.245
-Maybe you dodged a bullet.
-What does that mean?

00:37.328 --> 00:41.416
Never got a chance to finish my proposal.
Now you got time, you can think about

00:41.499 --> 00:44.169
-whether you wanna be married or not.
-Jack...

00:45.211 --> 00:49.758
we both agreed to postpone the proposal
and just focus on the pregnancy.

00:49.841 --> 00:50.675
I know.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.596
-I didn't wanna overwhelm you.
-I was overwhelmed.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.556
But here's the deal.

00:57.474 --> 01:01.561
Okay? Whether or not you ask me
to marry you, you are stuck with me.

01:01.644 --> 01:02.562
-What?
-I know.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.147
-Like, forever?
-And ever.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.983
That works both ways.
You're gonna be stuck with me too.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.027
I wouldn't have it any other way.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.239
Mm.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.993
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm just a little riled up.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.372
-You're pretty cute when you're riled up.
-Oh, you like that?

01:21.456 --> 01:23.208
-Mm-hm.
-Ooh.

01:23.291 --> 01:27.337
-Oh, I thought you were tired.
-Lucky for you I just got a second wind.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.380
Okay, three-mile mark.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.632
-What was our pace?
-Uh...

02:13.216 --> 02:15.385
-Eleven minutes.
-Really? That slow?

02:16.136 --> 02:19.347
I know. But Jack is worried
that I'm still running,

02:19.430 --> 02:23.977
-so I told him that I'd pull back and...
-Why is he worried about you running?

02:25.562 --> 02:26.729
I get shin splints.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.023
Got it.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.443
Well, thanks for letting me tag along.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.613
I didn't really feel like running alone
this morning.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.575
Yeah. It was a pleasant surprise
when you called.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.327
-Please come with me anytime.
-I will take you up on that.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.454
-Okay.
-Oh, I gotta go.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.374
-Jack's waiting for me at the bar.
-Hey, wait a minute. Um...

02:46.958 --> 02:49.335
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry

02:49.419 --> 02:53.047
-about what's going on with your parents.
-Yeah. It's a shock.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.091
-I thought they were solid.
-Yeah.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.678
Well, if you need anything at all,
I'm here to help.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.890
You need to remind my brother
how lucky he is to have you.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.474
-Okay.
-Bye.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.851
-Thank you.
-Bye.

03:04.934 --> 03:05.768
Mel.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.104
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

03:08.187 --> 03:11.649
-How's it going?
-Good. I've just finished my second loop.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.193
-Yeah, nice. I'm doing my third right now.
-Seriously?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.779
Scout's honor,
I actually might go for a fourth.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.324
Wow. Uh, you trying to show me up?

03:19.407 --> 03:24.579
Actually, I am trying to get yesterday out
of my head. That whole stillborn thing.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.958
I've had patients die.
I've just-- Never a baby.

03:29.042 --> 03:33.671
I got the lab results back. I rushed them.
It was a blood clot in the placenta.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.715
Oh, okay. So prenatal care...

03:35.798 --> 03:38.384
In this situation?
Wouldn't have prevented the stillbirth.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.387
Well, I'll call the parents
and let them know.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.972
-Yeah.
-Uh...

03:43.056 --> 03:46.184
If you need to clear your head,
I can cover for you at the clinic.

03:46.267 --> 03:50.605
Yeah, thanks. No, but I think
I'd feel better just being around people.

03:51.356 --> 03:55.568
Hey, I-- You know, I was gonna mention,
um, maybe you might wanna have dinner

03:55.652 --> 04:00.031
-with me and Jack sometime?
-Uh, how about tonight? I could barbecue.

04:00.698 --> 04:01.532
Um...

04:01.616 --> 04:05.078
Unless you can't, fine.
We could have dinner next week or--

04:05.161 --> 04:07.247
No, no, no, we would love to.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.583
-Check in with Jack and let me know.
-He'll be fine.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.961
Okay. Uh, around 6:00?

04:13.044 --> 04:18.841
-Okay. I will make a blueberry crumble.
-Wow. Super human at work and you bake.

04:18.925 --> 04:23.054
It's the only thing I know how to bake
and I haven't made it in years,

04:23.137 --> 04:25.682
-so it might be bad.
-Right, it probably won't be good.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.308
Probably not.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.396
Bet it'll be awesome.
I'll see you tonight.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.064
Okay. Bye.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.945
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.408
-So did Dad leave?
-Yeah, a few hours ago.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.912
-What did he say?
-He said Mom wants to travel

04:47.996 --> 04:49.706
and he can't because of work.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.083
-What? That's ridiculous.
-Yeah.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.461
I mean,
the problem is they can't live alone.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.965
-Why not?
-Well, they're getting older.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.551
If they're alone, they're gonna need help.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.221
Thanks.
Did you know Mom can't drive at night?

05:05.305 --> 05:09.017
She won't even touch an ATM
because she doesn't trust computers.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.144
-And Dad?
-Last time Mom went to the mall,

05:11.227 --> 05:13.146
Dad made pasta, left the gas on.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.690
If I hadn't stopped by,
he would've blown up the house.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.191
You're gonna have to stop this.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.027
-Me?
-You're the golden child.

05:19.110 --> 05:23.156
-I-- No, I am not the golden child.
-Oh, please. If Dad sent out

05:23.239 --> 05:25.491
one of those newsletters,
I wouldn't be mentioned.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.952
Think Mom would let that happen?
You're her prince.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.788
Gotta do something.
Otherwise, you end up living with Dad.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.207
And you're gonna be living with Mom.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.961
Oh, Christ. Yeah,
we gotta treat this like an emergency.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.881
You deal with Mom
and I'll figure out how to deal with Dad

05:39.964 --> 05:42.258
-after I meet with Valerie.
-What?

05:43.384 --> 05:46.429
-I'm signing my contract today.
-Yeah.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.223
Oh, that's fantastic. Oh...

05:49.307 --> 05:51.225
That means
you're gonna be here for a year.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.186
Yes, unless you piss me off.

05:54.187 --> 05:58.691
Well, that's great
and I'm really happy you're staying,

05:58.775 --> 06:02.487
but there's one favor
that I need from you.

06:02.570 --> 06:06.157
You don't wanna hear this,
but be careful with Brady, okay?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.284
He has a habit of attracting trouble.

06:08.367 --> 06:11.204
Look,
I don't know where Brady and I stand,

06:11.287 --> 06:13.831
but whatever happens,
I can take care of myself.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.418
I know. I just don't want you
to take any unnecessary risks.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.336
Fine.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.422
-Then I need to ask you a favor.
-What?

06:21.506 --> 06:24.425
Will you talk to Mike,
find out if he'll help out with the case?

06:24.509 --> 06:27.345
Sure. I can't guarantee
he's gonna cooperate.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.056
Do what I do
and don't take no for an answer.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.059
Got your stubborn streak from Dad,
you know?

06:33.142 --> 06:36.229
-You got your hair from Mom. Wanna trade?
-No. Never.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.863
Mom. It's Jack.
Will you give me a call when you get this?

06:45.947 --> 06:46.781
I love you.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.328
Hi, Ben. Um...

06:52.411 --> 06:55.748
-Did you and Lee get my message?
-Yeah, I did.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.709
Lee's inside with Iris.
They're both asleep.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.337
I wanted you to know
there's nothing you could have done

07:01.420 --> 07:02.797
to prevent the blood clot.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.677
-Okay.
<i>-I'm so sorry.</i>

07:07.760 --> 07:09.595
I hope that knowing that helps.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.183
People keep saying they're sorry,
but it's-- It doesn't change anything.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.896
-I know. You're right. There are no words.
<i>-Like somebody sliced open my heart.</i>

07:20.857 --> 07:21.691
I understand.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.776
I really do.

07:23.860 --> 07:28.281
<i>I just want you to know</i>
<i>that I'm here if you ever need anything.</i>

07:29.532 --> 07:30.616
Thank you, but I--

07:31.909 --> 07:33.911
Nothing is gonna bring Daisy back.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.181
-What are you doing?
-Didn't want anyone to overhear.

07:53.264 --> 07:57.602
This whole Christopher thing,
has your detective found anything?

07:57.685 --> 07:59.145
-No. Uh...

07:59.228 --> 08:01.856
No, not yet,
but I'm trying to stay positive.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.526
I've said this before,
but I feel I let you down.

08:05.610 --> 08:09.655
When I saw Vince,
maybe I should have grabbed a weapon,

08:09.739 --> 08:11.407
like a kitchen knife.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.160
Connie, none of this is your fault.
If you had done that,

08:14.243 --> 08:18.789
he may have hurt you and Christopher.
You made the right decision cooperating.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.667
No, but it doesn't feel like it.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.880
I'm so worried.

08:25.963 --> 08:26.797
I know.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.549
I know. I am too.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.100
Hey. I'm Dr. Hayek.
I put in an order for takeout.

08:38.184 --> 08:42.271
-Oh, you're Cameron.
-Yeah. Have we met?

08:42.355 --> 08:45.024
I'm Jack Sheridan.
You work with Mel, right?

08:45.107 --> 08:47.109
Right.
Been looking forward to meeting you.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.445
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, my patient said you are the glue

08:49.529 --> 08:52.865
-that holds this town together.
-I don't know about that.

08:53.407 --> 08:54.992
You got a cool setup here.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.329
Thanks. Yeah, we're happy with it.
Hey, Preach, come meet Dr. Hayek.

08:58.412 --> 08:59.872
-Hey.
-Cameron.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.124
-Preacher. Good to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.001
-I'll get your order.
-Thanks.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.088
-So how are you liking it here?
-It's exceeded my expectations.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.841
Everyone in this town has been great.
Especially Mel, she's incredible.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.635
Yeah, she's one of a kind.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.471
I lucked out, because I've worked
with some real assholes.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.391
Overall, people are good to one another.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.810
-Sense of community.
-Why not fill me in tonight?

09:20.893 --> 09:23.813
-Why, what's tonight?
-I invited you and Mel over for a barbecue

09:23.896 --> 09:24.855
at Jo Ellen's.

09:24.939 --> 09:28.025
Well, thanks, but I don't think
the B and B has a working grill.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.237
-So the one on the back patio--
-Is purely ornamental.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.365
Jo Ellen's been nagging Nick
to buy her a new one.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.200
-Damn. That's too bad.
-Here you go.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.119
-Oh. Thank you.
-You bet.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.788
We can barbecue at our place at the cabin.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.249
-It's not gonna put you out?
-Not at all.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.167
-I'll grab steaks from the back.
-Sure?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.878
-Absolutely.
-Sounds good. See you tonight.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.297
-All right.
-For you.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.214
Thank you.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.677
Have a good day.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.223
So, what else did Denny say?

09:59.307 --> 10:03.603
His grandma and Doc dated when Doc
was in college and she got pregnant.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.148
She broke up with Doc
and never told him about the baby.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.817
-And the baby is Denny's dad?
-Right.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.737
-Wonder why he's here.
-Wants to get to know his grandfather.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.282
Oh, Lizzie, so naive.
There's always a motive.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.367
You watch way too much true crime.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.536
Jo Ellen thinks
Denny's after an inheritance.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.748
Personally,
I think he's planning to blackmail Doc.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.460
-Blackmail him for what?
-For keeping his love child a secret.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.880
Doc introduced him as his grandson.
So there goes that theory.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.507
Oh, listen. Doc is like family.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.343
We have to protect him.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.970
If you notice anything strange,
let me know.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.349
The only thing strange
is you accusing an innocent guy of fraud.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.977
Honey, my instincts
about people are never wrong.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.313
You mark my words.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.523
This kid's up to something.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.469
-Hi, Hope.
-I'm making hermit cookies

11:18.552 --> 11:21.847
and I can't remember
how many eggs I'm supposed to use.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.893
<i>-And how would I know?</i>
-You've seen me make them a million times.

11:25.976 --> 11:30.022
I've eaten them plenty, but I don't think
I've watched you make them.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.733
I knew you'd be no help. I'll text Connie.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.861
Don't. I'll Google it for you.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.405
Why would you do that?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.573
Connie, once she starts texting--

11:39.657 --> 11:42.034
<i>-She won't stop.</i>

11:42.118 --> 11:45.329
So, um, why did you leave so early
this morning?

11:45.413 --> 11:50.543
Oh, I had some work I had to catch up on.
Are you okay on your own for a few hours?

11:50.626 --> 11:54.547
-I want you to think of me as a cat.
<i>-What does that mean?</i>

11:54.630 --> 11:57.967
It means
I have zero interest in socialization.

11:58.050 --> 12:02.638
All I need is access to food, water
and the human version of a litter box.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.598
Can I scratch behind your ears?

12:04.682 --> 12:07.852
-Not unless I'm in the mood.
<i>-That's very cat-like.</i>

12:07.935 --> 12:11.188
-I need to talk to you tonight.
-Can't you tell me now?

12:11.272 --> 12:13.482
<i>No, I don't wanna talk</i>
<i>about it on the phone.</i>

12:13.566 --> 12:15.568
Good Lord, you're frustrating.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.780
<i>That sounds like</i>
<i>there's somebody at the door.</i>

12:19.864 --> 12:22.366
It's like Grand Central Station over here.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.493
Would you answer the door, please?

12:24.577 --> 12:28.497
<i>Connie had Marge drop off groceries</i>
<i>and I don't want them left out.</i>

12:28.581 --> 12:31.667
Fine,
but I'm not inviting anybody inside. Bye.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.216
Can I come in?

12:50.436 --> 12:51.270
-Hey.
-Hi.

12:51.353 --> 12:55.608
-Can I get a chocolate donut?
-Sure. Anything else?

12:55.691 --> 12:59.028
Wondering if you wanted
to go to a movie tonight. Thanks.

12:59.737 --> 13:03.741
-The Light Road is showing <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>
-I love that movie, but I'm filling in

13:03.824 --> 13:06.744
-at the bar and won't get off till 9:00.
-Last showing starts at 10:00.

13:06.827 --> 13:11.290
-Oh, then count me in.
-Text me when you're done with work.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.423
Remember what I said.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.687
I know the deer got
into your giant Darwins.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.439
Oh, so thoughtful.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.318
-Thank you.
-Some of my best memories

13:39.401 --> 13:41.362
are of helping you
and my mom in the garden.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.447
You're a natural. Just like Lilly.

13:48.577 --> 13:52.581
-I wanted to say sorry about yesterday.
-You have nothing to be sorry for.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.378
I'm the one who owes you an apology.
I was caught off guard.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.172
You look just like Lilly
when she was your age.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.676
Every time I look at you, I...

14:05.427 --> 14:07.054
I miss her so much.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.641
I miss her too.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.937
-I hope you'll forgive me.
-Of course I do.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.814
I wish I could forgive myself.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.401
For being away
during those last few weeks.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.654
There is nothing that you could have done
to keep her from leaving us.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.740
I didn't get to say goodbye.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.244
Mom knew how much you loved her.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.621
That's all that she needed.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.790
I know how you feel.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.876
You do?

14:36.959 --> 14:43.132
When my dad died,
I hadn't spoken to him in like a month.

14:44.425 --> 14:48.762
And not for any good reason,
just because I was busy.

14:49.805 --> 14:52.474
Not being able to say goodbye still hurts.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.937
You're the closest thing I have to my mom.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.814
I can't lose you both.

15:03.319 --> 15:07.823
It's been so hard not having her around,
and I know you've been through a lot.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.452
But I really need you, Hope.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.954
Oh, honey, I'm right here.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.714
I want you to continue icing it
for the rest of today,

15:23.797 --> 15:29.053
-and then take it easy for about a week.
-All right. And can you write me a note?

15:29.136 --> 15:31.931
-Otherwise, Jo Ellen won't believe me.

15:32.014 --> 15:35.059
And let's just say
that I can't run the vacuum.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.019
For like two weeks. Is that good enough?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.188
You're an angel sent from heaven.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.315
-Thanks, Nick.
-Thanks.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.232
Bye.

15:50.157 --> 15:50.991
Hey.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.327
Nick just left.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.413
Thanks for seeing him. How's his wrist?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.332
Oh, it was just a light sprain.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.125
Yeah.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.921
He did say something interesting, though.

16:05.005 --> 16:08.550
Um... He said that
your grandson is visiting?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.386
Oh.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.387
He did, did he?

16:13.097 --> 16:14.974
Well, yes, it is true.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.977
Oh. Sorry,
I didn't know that you had any children.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.353
I didn't either.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.855
And neither does Hope.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.984
Given the speed
with which news travels around here,

16:25.067 --> 16:26.443
that could be a problem.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.529
If it was a secret, how did Nick find out?

16:28.612 --> 16:30.572
It's not exactly a secret.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.118
I introduced Denny to Lizzie.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.453
But Connie overheard.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.914
Right, so she told Jo Ellen,
who told Nick.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.874
You hit the nail on the head.

16:40.958 --> 16:45.129
You better tell Hope fast
if you want her to hear it from you first.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.423
Well, I'm gonna try tonight. I just--

16:48.048 --> 16:50.426
It's hard to find the right time.

16:51.885 --> 16:52.720
Plus, I...

16:54.346 --> 16:58.934
I have been processing the fact
that I had a son.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.936
Had?

17:02.271 --> 17:05.983
Yeah, he died about a month ago
from a heart attack.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.986
Oh, Doc, I am so sorry.

17:09.069 --> 17:13.532
I gained a son and then I lost him
in the blink of an eye.

17:14.950 --> 17:18.620
And it's silly
because I'm missing something I never had.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.164
No, that's not silly.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.081
That's...

17:21.790 --> 17:25.711
You know, he became a part of you
the second you knew he existed.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.130
I didn't know him. I--

17:29.423 --> 17:33.469
I think that it's the, you know,
what could have been

17:33.552 --> 17:35.095
that makes it so hard.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.597
What could have been.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.894
You know
that I had a stillborn daughter, right?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.480
Yeah.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.899
I never got to look at her eyes.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.236
I never got to hear her voice, but I--

17:52.571 --> 17:55.074
Oh, I miss her every single day.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.328
I think there's some things
that you just never get over.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.954
And losing a child is one of them.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.664
And then...

18:04.166 --> 18:09.213
delivering Daisy
and having to see her parents' heartache,

18:09.296 --> 18:11.298
it just brought everything back.
I'm sorry.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.885
Thank you.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.513
I can't imagine
how hard that must have been for you.

18:19.223 --> 18:23.060
Grief doesn't ever get lighter.
We just get used to carrying the weight.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.064
You lost a lot of people that you love.

18:29.399 --> 18:34.154
-Too many.
-Listen, personal issues are not my forte,

18:34.238 --> 18:36.907
but I am around if you need to talk.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.869
Thank you, Doc. That's really sweet.

18:42.955 --> 18:47.209
Wait. I'm supposed to be comforting you,
not the other way around. Sorry.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.961
Friends don't keep score.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.506
Thanks.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.353
Julia. Preacher.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.063
I took your aikido class.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.356
Yes, of course.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.526
And I've figured out where I've seen you.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.278
I've eaten at Jack's bar.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.571
Oh, and how was it?

19:15.654 --> 19:18.574
It was delicious.
Have you been here before?

19:18.657 --> 19:21.660
Oh, yeah, this is where I get a lot
of my perishables for the bar.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.620
Ah. It is my first time.

19:23.704 --> 19:28.125
I've decided to eat more local and organic
and I don't know where to start.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.794
I take it the artichokes are good?

19:30.878 --> 19:34.006
Oh yeah, yeah,
my artichoke dip is a favorite at the bar.

19:34.089 --> 19:37.843
Ah. Hey, what do you call a conversation
between two artichokes?

19:38.927 --> 19:41.180
-Uh...
-A heart-to-heart.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.432
-Oh, wow.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.309
Oh, I can't believe I said that out loud.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.311
-No, it was cute.
-No, it wasn't.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.188
I love a good arti-joke.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.356
-Oh...

19:51.440 --> 19:54.401
So where do you want to start?
Fruits? Vegetables?

19:54.484 --> 19:57.070
-They have wine?
-Oh, and a tasty one.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.115
Ooh. Then why are we still standing here?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.868
-Follow me.
-Okay.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.125
Thanks.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.383
-Hey. Thanks for seeing me.
-Hey.

20:18.467 --> 20:22.137
Oh, well, you know, if it wasn't for you,
I would have failed civil procedure.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.140
-Wilkinson was a real prick.
-He was. Have a seat.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.975
So how do you like being an agent?

20:27.768 --> 20:29.186
-It suits me.
-Yeah?

20:30.145 --> 20:33.190
-Still working in the DA's office?
-I took a job at a small law firm

20:33.273 --> 20:36.568
-in Humboldt County.
-Uh-huh. So that's why you're here.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.486
Sort of.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.530
-I have a favor to ask.
-Shoot.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.617
I need to see the Emerald Lumber file.

20:44.993 --> 20:48.413
A friend of mine has been framed
for attempted murder

20:48.497 --> 20:51.667
and the key to that
is somewhere in your file.

20:51.750 --> 20:57.172
You know, the DEA poured a lot of time
and money into that raid

20:57.256 --> 20:59.341
because we wanted convictions.
We didn't get them.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.135
Yeah. That task force
had way too many cooks in the kitchen.

21:02.219 --> 21:06.515
-Yeah.
-DEA, ATF, FBI, Humboldt sheriff?

21:06.598 --> 21:08.725
No way to know
who tipped Calvin off in time

21:08.809 --> 21:12.688
-for him to destroy that evidence.
-So if you know all this,

21:12.771 --> 21:15.482
-why do you need the file?
-I need your notes.

21:16.149 --> 21:19.861
-So I can see that case through your eyes.
-Brie, no. I could lose my job here.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.281
An innocent man
could end up serving life in prison.

21:22.364 --> 21:26.660
Daniel Brady? That's the friend
you're trying to protect, right?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.586
God, I just hope
you know what you're doing, Brie.

21:41.883 --> 21:42.718
Twenty-four hours.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.388
-And don't show it to another soul.
-Thank you.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.682
I owe you one.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.643
Yeah, you do.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.855
You're doing the right thing.

22:07.242 --> 22:11.955
-Hey! What are you doing here?
-Preacher asked me to fill in for Hannah.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.791
So how are you?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.045
Fine. What do you need me to do?

22:18.128 --> 22:21.840
If you wanna serve, I can bus. I know
how much dirty dishes gross you out.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.342
Nothing more disgusting.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.511
-Well, what about a blobfish?
-Let's not start naming gross things.

22:29.806 --> 22:34.269
Hey, so I've been memorizing my lines
for the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> scene.

22:35.270 --> 22:39.941
The fair's coming up and I was wondering
if you want to get together to practice.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.818
Oh. Um...

22:43.570 --> 22:44.696
I don't think we should.

22:44.780 --> 22:48.784
-I thought you were into performing.
-I was, but I changed my mind.

22:49.576 --> 22:53.163
Lizzie, I-- I know I hurt you
and I'm really sorry,

22:53.246 --> 22:55.082
and I swear I'll never lie to you again.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.168
-I don't feel like it.
-Why won't you give me a second chance?

22:58.251 --> 23:02.464
Because I trusted you
and you lied to me, over and over.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.926
I said I'm sorry. What else can I do?

23:08.136 --> 23:08.970
Nothing.

23:10.388 --> 23:14.768
Maybe someday I'll forgive you,
but... not right now.

23:19.856 --> 23:24.361
Yes, from scratch. I'm going to pick up
the blueberries and brown sugar.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.279
I'm happy to get stuff from Connie's.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.907
-It's okay, babe. I got it.
<i>-As long as you're up for it.</i>

23:29.616 --> 23:30.492
I am.

23:30.575 --> 23:33.912
Please just don't take too long.
I don't know this guy.

23:33.995 --> 23:37.082
<i>That's literally the point,</i>
<i>is to get to know him.</i>

23:37.165 --> 23:40.252
Jack, I'm making a crumble
and a human being simultaneously.

23:40.335 --> 23:44.131
<i>-You can survive one barbecue.</i>
-I have no comeback for that.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.465
That was the point.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.717
I love you. I'll see you.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.431
Wow. Five brothers.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.559
Mm-hm. And I'm the youngest.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.228
No wonder you got into martial arts.

23:58.895 --> 24:02.607
It was less about defense
and more about wanting to be included.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.277
They didn't want their weakling sister
ruining the games.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.572
-So did it work?
-Soon as I learned

24:08.655 --> 24:11.116
to drop my oldest brother Freddy,
they let me hang out.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.826
Good for you.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.912
Your other job,
you are a recruiter, right?

24:15.996 --> 24:17.956
I specialize in medical staffing.

24:18.039 --> 24:21.168
-That sounds interesting.
-It is. It's like a puzzle.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.588
Somewhere there's a piece missing,
it is my job to find it.

24:24.671 --> 24:28.508
-I used to love doing puzzles.
-Used to?

24:29.176 --> 24:34.181
Yeah, once I finished active duty, it took
me a while to get back into normal life.

24:34.264 --> 24:38.560
So before I found a job,
I would do puzzles.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.061
To keep myself busy.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.982
I read that a lot of veterans feel
out of place when they come home.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.902
Well, one day,
you are fighting in a war zone.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.405
A few days later,
you're standing in line buying groceries.

24:51.531 --> 24:52.407
It's surreal.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.660
Were you bitter, fighting in a war?

24:55.744 --> 24:57.204
No, I chose to enlist.

24:57.704 --> 25:00.790
When I came back from Iraq in one piece,

25:01.291 --> 25:04.085
I chose to live
with gratitude instead of anger.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.170
That's beautiful.

25:05.712 --> 25:08.298
Gratitude is one
of the basic tenets of aikido.

25:08.381 --> 25:11.259
Yes, and one of the reasons
I decided to try it.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.262
-When are you coming back to class?
-I don't know.

25:14.888 --> 25:15.972
I don't know. I, um...

25:17.098 --> 25:18.308
I feel like the BFG.

25:19.601 --> 25:20.727
Big Friendly Giant.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.396
The Roald Dahl character? Funny.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.733
Well, I do offer private lessons.

25:26.816 --> 25:28.401
-Is that so?
-Mm-hm.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.487
I would give you
the friends-and-family rate.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.988
That is quite the offer.

25:32.697 --> 25:36.076
-I'd be a fool to refuse.
-And you are definitely no fool.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.285
Cheers to that.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.791
Dan Brady?

25:42.874 --> 25:44.626
Yeah, who are you?

25:44.709 --> 25:47.295
Bondsman. Congratulations, you made bail.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.341
-What? How?
-Note the conditions of release.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.344
Number one, surrender your passport.
Two, don't leave the state.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.180
Doesn't say who posted my bail.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.266
As long as the check clears, I don't care.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.726
So that's it? I'm free to go?

26:02.602 --> 26:05.355
Don't screw me. If you're a no-show,
I'll come after you.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.275
Relax. I'll be there.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.367
<i>Dr. Chang, Cardiology.</i>
<i>Dr. Chang, Cardiology.</i>

26:44.144 --> 26:46.354
Hey, are you okay?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.273
Carl...

26:48.857 --> 26:49.691
can't...

26:50.442 --> 26:52.694
find his car.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.279
Okay, who's Carl?

26:55.238 --> 26:56.865
-I am.
-Okay.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.577
Carl, my name is Mel.
Are you here by yourself?

27:01.244 --> 27:03.204
I can't...

27:03.872 --> 27:05.623
find my car.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.043
Okay, I understand that. Why don't we--?

27:08.126 --> 27:12.005
Why don't we go to this bench here?
I can help you try to find your car. Okay?

27:13.590 --> 27:15.842
Carl, you have anyone that I can call?

27:16.718 --> 27:19.220
I live alone.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.182
Okay. Do you have any relatives close by?

27:23.183 --> 27:24.934
I have...

27:25.477 --> 27:27.312
-a daughter.
-Okay.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.356
Oh. Uh-oh.

27:29.439 --> 27:33.068
Okay, okay, all right. Carl?

27:34.194 --> 27:36.404
-Carl!
-Is he okay?

27:40.116 --> 27:41.743
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

27:41.826 --> 27:44.954
I need paramedics
at Swinton's Food Market in Clear River.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.999
I have an elderly man
unconscious and unresponsive.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.753
<i>Understood. Nearest unit</i>
<i>is 15 minutes out, ma'am.</i>

27:51.836 --> 27:54.214
I've lost his pulse,
I'm starting chest compressions.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.677
So you want a beer?

28:00.178 --> 28:02.722
-Wine? I got whiskey.
-Water would be great.

28:04.682 --> 28:05.517
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.645
How long have you lived in Virgin River?

28:09.396 --> 28:11.231
Oh... Seven years.

28:13.149 --> 28:15.110
-And before that?
-Sacramento.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.862
-Oh, you go to Davis?
-No.

28:18.363 --> 28:23.368
-Yeah. I did my undergrad at Berkeley.
-Small world, almost went there.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.537
-Yeah? Where did you end up?
-Mm.

28:26.329 --> 28:27.247
The Marines.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.417
I grew up in an ultra-liberal household.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.545
My parents would have lost their minds
if I had enlisted.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.630
-Mine weren't thrilled.
-Yeah.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.843
Who could blame them?
Sending kids overseas to fight for oil.

28:40.635 --> 28:45.014
Yeah, I mean, that's a bit
of an oversimplification.

28:45.098 --> 28:47.225
A little cynical, don't you think?

28:49.477 --> 28:50.311
Maybe.

28:52.147 --> 28:55.150
I guess we'll have
to agree to disagree on that one.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.069
Hey, look, I mean no disrespect.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.572
-Hey.
-No, I totally admire people

29:00.655 --> 29:03.783
willing to put their lives in danger
for something they believe in.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.786
Enlisted folks do that
every single day, you know?

29:07.996 --> 29:10.582
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.768
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

29:30.393 --> 29:31.519
Is Cameron here?

29:31.603 --> 29:32.771
Yeah, he's inside.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.939
-He's mashing potatoes.
-Oh.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.234
-Good. Nice job with the table.
-Thank you.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.488
Wanna know what I've learned
about me and Cameron?

29:41.571 --> 29:44.491
-What?
-Him and I have nothing in common.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.869
-I'm sure that's not true.
-I swear I tried, okay?

29:47.952 --> 29:48.953
-I did.
-Really?

29:49.037 --> 29:49.871
Yes.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.459
You okay? You were gone a while.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.838
It's just this older man
had an episode outside the store,

29:58.922 --> 30:00.757
and I ended up having to give him CPR.

30:00.840 --> 30:04.135
I waited for them to get him
into the ambulance, and it was sad.

30:05.094 --> 30:08.181
He was all alone,
he didn't have anyone to call.

30:08.264 --> 30:10.433
-You look like you need a hug.
-Yeah.

30:13.686 --> 30:14.521
Hey.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.898
-Hey.
-You made it.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.485
Sorry I'm late, there was
an emergency at the grocery store.

30:20.568 --> 30:21.736
Is everybody okay?

30:21.820 --> 30:24.906
The medical response was fast,
so I think he's gonna be fine.

30:24.989 --> 30:28.660
But, um, I forgot all the stuff
to make the crumble.

30:28.743 --> 30:32.080
Oh. You chose to save a life
instead of making us dessert.

30:32.163 --> 30:35.542
Selfish. Let me put those on the grill,
you guys can chat.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.877
I got it. You're the guest, remember?

30:37.961 --> 30:40.964
I'll grab some lemonade.
Does anybody want anything?

30:41.047 --> 30:43.883
You guys talk, I'll get that for you.
I'll meet you out there.

31:47.989 --> 31:48.823
Hey, Mom.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.829
So, what was your last job?

31:55.538 --> 31:58.166
My last job was at a group practice
in downtown San Diego.

31:58.249 --> 32:01.753
-Not enough doctors to meet the demand.
-Yeah, let me guess.

32:01.836 --> 32:04.464
Back-to-back patients.
No time for paperwork.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.883
-Sounds like you have experience.
-Yeah.

32:06.966 --> 32:11.012
Well, I worked in an ER
and the burnout rate was like almost 50%.

32:11.095 --> 32:14.057
Yeah, that makes sense.
That's a lot of what I love

32:14.140 --> 32:17.602
about this clinic,
not feeling like you're being rushed.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.979
Really? I thought
you loved the paper charts.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.316
Crazy. I cannot believe
they haven't been digitized yet.

32:23.399 --> 32:26.819
Oh, my God, trust me.
I tried, but Doc freaked out on me.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.365
Trying to explain the cloud
to Doc is like--

32:30.448 --> 32:33.076
-Teaching a frog how to ride a bicycle.
-Exactly. It's--

32:33.159 --> 32:34.577
-Hey.
-Thank you, babe.

32:35.244 --> 32:37.997
Well, why don't we go to him
together and make our case?

32:38.081 --> 32:42.168
Okay. Well, I mean, we could try,
but he's pretty set in his ways.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.836
-I have faith in us.
-Okay.

32:44.837 --> 32:48.841
A couple of my patients were talking
about the Overview Trail Run

32:48.925 --> 32:51.511
-in, what is it, Grace Valley?
-Mm.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.179
-Heard of it? Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.473
I've wanted to go.
I just haven't made it there.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.558
I heard the view is breathtaking.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.436
Want to go?
The trail is like eight miles long,

33:00.520 --> 33:01.854
good to go with other people.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.399
You saying I'd have to carry you down?

33:04.482 --> 33:06.943
No, I'd pass out and you'd call for help.

33:07.527 --> 33:10.071
Oh, right, you're really selling this run.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.949
That's why I became a doctor
and not a salesman.

33:13.032 --> 33:14.367
Mm-hm. Good choice.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.203
Trail sounds fun, for you.

33:17.745 --> 33:19.998
-Not a runner?
-Mm-mm.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.125
No, not my thing.
Find it a little repetitive,

33:22.208 --> 33:24.669
I always start out
and I get bored and end up quitting.

33:26.337 --> 33:28.548
-I like repetition, I find it soothing.
-I know.

33:28.631 --> 33:31.884
I like it. You get into this groove
and lose yourself.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.177
I like knowing where I am.

33:35.847 --> 33:40.101
-What do you think, you wanna go?
-As long as you don't pass out, I'm in.

33:40.768 --> 33:44.272
Excellent. And in other good news...

33:44.772 --> 33:46.649
-The steaks are ready.
-Finally.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.693
-Shall we eat?
-I'm starving. Yes, please.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.499
Not too bad tonight.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.252
Except for the lady
who kept sending her food back.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.588
When she refused to pay,
I thought you were gonna deck her.

34:08.671 --> 34:11.257
People who are rude to servers
should not be allowed in restaurants.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.514
Hey, are you okay
to help Preacher close up? I gotta go.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.808
Sure. What, got a hot date?

34:21.934 --> 34:22.769
Maybe.

34:28.566 --> 34:31.319
-So you were engaged?
-Yeah, yeah.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.945
We broke it off a few months ago.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.947
-Bummer.
-It was bound to happen.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.533
We were just from two different worlds.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.410
She grew up in a big family,

34:39.494 --> 34:42.288
six brothers and sisters
outside of Philly--

34:42.371 --> 34:45.500
I would think that seeing the world
from someone else's point of view

34:45.583 --> 34:47.585
would make the relationship
more interesting.

34:47.668 --> 34:51.255
For some people, but for us, it meant
that we were just never on the same page.

34:51.339 --> 34:54.008
I'd wanna go out for a meal,
she'd wanna cook,

34:54.092 --> 34:57.470
or she wants to watch movies
and I wanna go rock climbing.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.722
I don't know
if that sounds like a deal breaker.

34:59.806 --> 35:02.975
They're not,
it's just when that starts piling up,

35:03.059 --> 35:07.355
you realize that you have
totally different interests and values.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.691
To a point where we couldn't agree
on what kind of eggs to buy.

35:11.275 --> 35:15.655
Oh, like the time I brought home
cage-free instead of free-range.

35:15.738 --> 35:20.535
I had to explain to you that
free-range means they get to go outside.

35:20.618 --> 35:23.162
-Well, I know that now.
-Yeah, you see?

35:23.246 --> 35:26.332
I mean, could you imagine
not agreeing on anything?

35:26.415 --> 35:30.086
Where you wanna live.
Your finances. How many kids you want.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.712
It's exhausting.

35:31.796 --> 35:35.967
Well, at least you figured out
your differences before you got married.

35:36.050 --> 35:39.345
And for that, I am grateful,
because once you have kids,

35:39.428 --> 35:42.181
you're tied to that person,
whether on the same page or not.

35:47.895 --> 35:48.729
Ta-da.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.359
They might taste terrible.

35:53.442 --> 35:54.735
Oh, how enticing.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.869
Actually, they're delicious.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.412
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.707
So...

36:10.543 --> 36:11.794
what did you wanna tell me?

36:15.047 --> 36:17.466
I'm just worried that it might upset you.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.552
Vernon, you're driving me crazy.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.262
-Out with it already.
-Okay.

36:23.139 --> 36:23.973
I have...

36:24.891 --> 36:26.100
a grandson.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.102
-What?

36:28.186 --> 36:31.689
A woman I dated in college
had a baby and never told me,

36:31.772 --> 36:35.484
and that baby had a son
and his name is Denny Cutler.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.069
Where does he live?

36:37.153 --> 36:37.987
In Seattle.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.448
And how did you find this out?

36:40.531 --> 36:43.576
Denny came to Virgin River a few days ago
and he introduced himself.

36:43.659 --> 36:46.078
He's here and you're just telling me now?

36:46.162 --> 36:51.667
Yes, I was nervous
because he's from another relationship.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.879
Are you currently
in a relationship with that woman?

36:54.962 --> 36:57.465
-No, of course not.
-Then it's in the past.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.425
I think it's amazing.

37:00.509 --> 37:01.510
You do?

37:01.594 --> 37:05.223
Neither of us had children,
or so I thought, and...

37:06.974 --> 37:08.851
there have been times I've regretted it.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.019
I never knew that.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.647
Well, not all the time.
But we have so much,

37:12.730 --> 37:16.984
would've been nice to share it
with a daughter or son and their children.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.655
To have had a house filled with family,
especially on Christmas or Thanksgiving.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.115
-Is that nuts?

37:23.199 --> 37:25.409
No, no. Not at all.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.163
I've often thought the same thing.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.499
This could be our second chance.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.544
You are really okay with this?

37:37.046 --> 37:38.547
It's a blessing.

37:40.424 --> 37:44.637
I am so happy to hear you say that,
because I feel exactly the same way.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.140
Oh, my gosh.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.978
Thank you so much for tonight.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.480
You're a very gracious non-host.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.858
Happy to accommodate.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.235
So, what'd you think of him?

38:02.571 --> 38:05.199
Well, he doesn't know how to cook steak.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.369
But he seems okay.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.163
He's definitely into you.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.666
What? No, he's not.

38:13.749 --> 38:15.334
Oh, come on.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.502
Oh, my gosh, Jack.

38:17.086 --> 38:20.965
He's a social guy
and he's lonely here. What?

38:21.048 --> 38:23.301
Okay. That's fine.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.636
As long as he keeps things
strictly professional.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.223
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

38:29.307 --> 38:34.270
-Do you ever think that I would ch--?
-No. I-- I'm not talking about you.

38:34.353 --> 38:37.023
-I trust you implicitly.
-Okay.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.442
So where's that coming from?

38:39.525 --> 38:42.445
My mom called
while I was getting your lemonade.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.529
What did she say?

38:43.612 --> 38:47.908
Turns out you were right.
The divorce wasn't because of my dad.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.829
She's in love with her art teacher.

38:51.912 --> 38:54.206
-Seriously?
-Yep.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.087
How do you feel about that?

39:00.171 --> 39:01.630
Honestly, I don't know.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.427
I never thought in a million years
that she'd even look at another guy.

39:06.510 --> 39:09.013
-How did she sound?
-Excited.

39:11.849 --> 39:16.145
It was weird. You know, it was like
talking to a complete stranger.

39:21.233 --> 39:22.318
It's the hospital.

39:25.404 --> 39:26.238
Hello?

39:28.324 --> 39:29.158
Excuse me?

39:57.937 --> 39:59.980
-Who is it?
-It's me.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.948
-Hey.
-I heard you made bail.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.032
Yeah.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.495
I don't know how, but yeah.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.288
-Well, could I come in?
-Brie.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.209
I'm sorry, but it's not a great time.

40:20.876 --> 40:21.710
Why not?

40:23.921 --> 40:25.464
-Brie, I...
-Hey.

40:29.176 --> 40:31.095
I just need to know you're okay.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.390
What if I'm not?

40:35.391 --> 40:36.642
I wanna fix it.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.767
-Does it hurt?
-No.

41:19.768 --> 41:20.895
Not enough to stop.
