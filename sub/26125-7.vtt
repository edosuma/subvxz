01:06.367 --> 01:08.726
The story so far...

01:08.727 --> 01:11.263
Two friends left school together.

01:11.265 --> 01:13.886
Two girls became women, and wives,

01:13.887 --> 01:16.366
till jealousy
tore their friendship apart.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.334
Read it. I mean every word.

01:18.336 --> 01:20.655
As Miss Sharp escaped
her lowly start...

01:20.820 --> 01:22.201
I've arrived.

01:22.368 --> 01:26.366
...so Miss Sedley
sank to the depths of misery.

01:26.367 --> 01:29.367
Till the day Becky flew too high.

01:30.395 --> 01:33.874
Tonight, Becky is lost
and then she is found

01:33.876 --> 01:35.875
but does she have a happy ending?

01:35.896 --> 01:38.895
Well, this is Vanity Fair.

01:38.896 --> 01:42.896
A world where everyone is striving
for what is not worth having.

01:52.576 --> 01:54.896
Woo!

02:13.896 --> 02:14.896
Vicky.

02:18.896 --> 02:20.895
Vicky.

02:20.896 --> 02:21.896
Vicky!

02:40.896 --> 02:42.895
That it should come to this.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.895
To lose our shop to the bailiffs

02:44.896 --> 02:47.895
because my husband
wouldn't stand up to her.

02:47.896 --> 02:49.096
Men!

03:13.896 --> 03:15.895
I don't want more money.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.895
I might as well have offered
to pay off the national debt.

03:17.896 --> 03:20.073
I said I don't want money.
What, then?

03:21.896 --> 03:22.896
What?

03:22.896 --> 03:23.896
Rawdon.

03:25.896 --> 03:26.896
It is the boy.

03:33.576 --> 03:35.896
Go to your room!

03:45.896 --> 03:48.895
Mother is the name for God
in the minds of little children,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.896
and my boy worships a stone.

03:52.256 --> 03:53.895
Or he did.

03:53.896 --> 03:54.896
He got over it.

03:57.096 --> 03:58.896
We both got over it.

04:05.896 --> 04:07.896
There's 600 here.

04:08.896 --> 04:10.249
Give it to Paul Briggs.

04:10.896 --> 04:13.014
I should never have
taken it off her.

04:14.896 --> 04:15.896
Listen, Bute.

04:17.096 --> 04:19.894
I think you'd agree that the old
place could do with a housekeeper.

04:19.896 --> 04:22.735
Queen's Crawley?
Could swallow a whole army of them.

04:22.736 --> 04:23.896
Take Briggs.

04:24.896 --> 04:25.896
She loves Rawdy.

04:26.896 --> 04:28.096
As his mother don't.

04:30.896 --> 04:31.896
I beg you.

04:33.096 --> 04:34.896
Be a friend to them both.

04:40.896 --> 04:42.426
Don't do anything foolish.

05:06.576 --> 05:08.165
What's the meaning of this?

05:09.416 --> 05:11.181
Did some little rodent squeak?

05:12.896 --> 05:17.895
How dare you... servants
sit in my presence, on my sofa?

05:17.896 --> 05:21.895
This here is Mrs Raggles' sofa.
Get out.

05:21.896 --> 05:24.426
Pay our wages
and you won't see us for dust.

05:27.896 --> 05:29.935
Mr Raggles, do you permit
these insults to me,

05:29.936 --> 05:32.896
a poor defenceless woman?

05:33.896 --> 05:36.895
You lived five years in this house.

05:36.896 --> 05:38.895
And paid just a third of the rent
due to me.

05:38.896 --> 05:41.895
Without that money, I am bankrupt.

05:41.896 --> 05:43.895
And I trusted you
because you are a Crawley.

05:43.896 --> 05:45.895
Exactly. So soon as the colonel
comes home...

05:45.896 --> 05:48.896
Why would he ever come home
to such as you?

05:56.896 --> 05:58.895
We shall lose this house
as well as the shop.

05:58.896 --> 06:01.896
Mrs Crawley,
my family has no roof over its head!

06:07.896 --> 06:09.735
Rawdon.

06:09.736 --> 06:10.895
Rawdon!

06:10.896 --> 06:12.896
This is not a good idea!

06:19.896 --> 06:22.095
Does he mean to challenge you?

06:22.096 --> 06:23.895
To a duel.

06:23.896 --> 06:28.256
He'll have to learn to shoot from
a surprisingly long distance.

06:33.896 --> 06:36.896
I have a plan
for the dashing colonel.

06:39.096 --> 06:40.575
Brother.

06:40.576 --> 06:42.896
Dear brother, this is not the way.

06:52.896 --> 06:54.895
My Lord Steyne gives notice

06:54.896 --> 06:58.895
that you may expect a communication
laying out his terms.

06:58.896 --> 07:01.896
Terms? I want satisfaction!

07:03.896 --> 07:07.895
Such as you are insects, sir,

07:07.896 --> 07:10.896
to be crushed
beneath his Lordship's feet.

07:14.896 --> 07:16.896
Does he know who we are?

07:35.096 --> 07:36.895
Sir Bute.

07:36.896 --> 07:37.896
Rebecca.

07:37.897 --> 07:39.896
A word?

07:43.896 --> 07:46.895
I have received Lord Steyne
alone 100 times, it's true.

07:46.896 --> 07:50.935
But I'm only guilty of too much
devotedness to Rawdon's service.

07:50.936 --> 07:53.895
Our family's service.

07:53.896 --> 07:56.256
I looked for a peerage for you.

07:57.896 --> 08:00.895
My God, reconcile us,

08:00.896 --> 08:01.896
dear brother.

08:01.897 --> 08:03.895
Pity me.

08:03.896 --> 08:06.896
And bring my cruel, cruel Rawdon
home.

08:07.896 --> 08:10.014
For I am innocent
as the day is long.

08:20.896 --> 08:23.735
Your soul is black with vanity.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.895
You won't forget me,
though, will you?

08:25.896 --> 08:27.838
It'll be so boring when I'm gone.

08:42.895 --> 08:46.895
"Congratulations are due
to Colonel Rawdon Crawley who,

08:46.896 --> 08:49.895
upon the recommendation
of Lord Steyne,

08:49.896 --> 08:53.896
is appointed Governor-General
of Coventry Island."

08:54.896 --> 08:56.896
A promotion?

08:58.896 --> 08:59.896
Coventry Island.

09:01.896 --> 09:02.896
I don't know either.

09:02.897 --> 09:05.575
Somewhere off the Ivory Coast,
I think.

09:05.576 --> 09:06.896
Africa?

09:07.896 --> 09:08.896
Hot, then.

09:08.897 --> 09:10.896
And wet.

09:11.896 --> 09:13.896
Mosquitoes the size of parrots.

09:15.896 --> 09:20.896
The last Governor-General
died within six months, I believe.

09:24.256 --> 09:25.896
Don't go.

09:27.096 --> 09:28.896
Rawdon, I beg you.

09:30.096 --> 09:31.896
No wife.

09:32.896 --> 09:34.576
No home.

09:36.736 --> 09:37.896
No honour.

09:40.896 --> 09:42.896
What else is there left?

09:49.896 --> 09:51.896
It's the end of the line.

10:02.896 --> 10:04.416
Ahoy.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.896
Major Dobbin?

10:38.896 --> 10:40.895
Miles away, as usual.

10:40.896 --> 10:43.895
Did you try some of that
chamomile tea?

10:43.896 --> 10:46.895
For sure, the best cure
for melancholy in a gentleman

10:46.896 --> 10:48.735
is not chamomile tea.

10:48.736 --> 10:49.895
Dobbin!

10:49.896 --> 10:51.895
Dobbin.

10:51.896 --> 10:54.426
A letter from my mother.
You'll never guess.

10:58.896 --> 11:00.256
What on earth?

11:02.256 --> 11:03.895
My sister, she is...

11:03.896 --> 11:04.896
Dead?

11:04.897 --> 11:07.896
...to be married! To the vicar.

11:10.896 --> 11:12.256
Put that face away now.

11:21.936 --> 11:25.895
If nothing else will ever
truly make you happy, William,

11:25.896 --> 11:30.896
you must fly away home now
and prevent that wedding.

11:31.896 --> 11:33.895
Peggy O'Dowd.

11:33.896 --> 11:35.896
Mother of all the regiment.

11:37.416 --> 11:39.416
Your blessing means all the world.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.715
"Louisa Grace Sedley.

11:52.717 --> 11:54.877
"Loving wife and mother."

11:58.604 --> 12:01.084
Not so loving towards the end.

12:03.084 --> 12:06.083
She endured many trials, Father.

12:06.531 --> 12:08.077
Which I caused.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.936
And you bore, my patient dear.

12:13.771 --> 12:16.930
Reverend Binney. Good morning.
Good to see you.

12:16.931 --> 12:18.930
Good morning.

12:18.931 --> 12:20.931
Shall we walk together?
Pleasure.

12:28.931 --> 12:29.931
Why all the rush?

12:33.931 --> 12:37.930
Five months' travelling and barely
a lunch to restore our wits.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.931
Let alone our poor suffering
stomachs!

12:46.122 --> 12:48.321
Fine year for the rosehips,
Mrs Osborne.

12:48.322 --> 12:51.122
Yes, I shall make syrup
for the harvest supper.

12:53.122 --> 12:55.121
You know, I think it
may be coming on to rain.

12:55.122 --> 12:58.122
But we have our butterfly hunt!

12:59.162 --> 13:02.122
Mr Sedley,
do you know these gentlemen?

13:05.122 --> 13:06.122
William?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.122
Jos!

13:12.122 --> 13:14.121
My dear boy!

13:14.122 --> 13:17.121
Major Dobbin, Mr Sedley.
We'll leave you to your guests.

13:17.122 --> 13:19.122
Yes. Thank you.

13:20.122 --> 13:21.321
My dear Amelia.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.121
My darling brother.

13:23.122 --> 13:26.121
Come on. Let's get you inside.

13:26.122 --> 13:28.122
You must be hungry.

13:32.122 --> 13:36.121
Um... Was I wrong to imagine
I should be congratulating you

13:36.122 --> 13:38.121
on your engagement?

13:38.122 --> 13:41.121
Happily, I was saved
further embarrassment

13:41.122 --> 13:44.122
by the arrival of that
very charming new teacher.

13:45.122 --> 13:49.321
But... where is your lady wife?
You were to marry Miss O'Dowd.

13:49.322 --> 13:52.440
I'm known throughout India
as a hopeless old bachelor.

14:00.122 --> 14:01.122
The English summer!

14:01.123 --> 14:03.122
It's purest heaven to me.

14:04.122 --> 14:06.122
Run.

14:07.122 --> 14:08.122
Ooh!

14:10.122 --> 14:13.641
So you see,
none of my investments was unwise,

14:13.642 --> 14:16.121
not really. Look at this.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.961
Yes, there will be tea.

14:17.962 --> 14:20.121
Georgie has grown so tall,
you must go and visit him

14:20.122 --> 14:22.122
while you're in London!

14:26.122 --> 14:28.122
You still play it? The piano.

14:30.122 --> 14:31.122
Of course.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.121
The kindest man in the world.

14:35.122 --> 14:38.121
To seek it out, return it to me,

14:38.122 --> 14:40.122
knowing how much it meant.

14:42.802 --> 14:46.121
It was the greatest pleasure
of my life,

14:46.122 --> 14:48.122
I assure you, Amelia.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.122
What...?

14:54.962 --> 14:56.122
No!

14:57.162 --> 14:59.122
No, that's...

15:00.122 --> 15:02.122
I thought someone else.

15:07.122 --> 15:10.121
Amelia.

15:10.122 --> 15:11.122
Amelia, please!

15:14.802 --> 15:16.121
How could it not be me?

15:16.122 --> 15:18.641
I must seem very ungrateful,
I do beg your pardon!

15:18.642 --> 15:21.121
I have loved you since the very
first moment that I saw you.

15:21.122 --> 15:23.121
Stop, I can't!

15:23.122 --> 15:24.961
That day in Vauxhall 13 years ago,

15:24.962 --> 15:26.641
since then,
no hour in the day has passed

15:26.642 --> 15:28.121
that I have not thought of you.

15:28.122 --> 15:29.122
Please, stop!

15:29.123 --> 15:32.121
I came to tell you
before I left for India,

15:32.122 --> 15:34.321
but you didn't care, so I left.
But I'm here now!

15:34.322 --> 15:35.481
Now?!

15:35.482 --> 15:37.801
What use is now?

15:37.802 --> 15:39.322
You are too late!

15:41.122 --> 15:44.121
I prayed and prayed
for a friend to come

15:44.122 --> 15:46.321
when they took away my little boy
and it nearly killed me!

15:46.322 --> 15:49.121
That's when you should have come!

15:49.122 --> 15:51.005
I am sorry.
George is my husband!

15:51.322 --> 15:54.121
Here and in heaven.

15:54.122 --> 15:56.122
And for ever.

16:01.122 --> 16:02.322
I am sorry, too!

16:18.962 --> 16:21.641
I'm no fool, Major Dobbin.

16:21.642 --> 16:24.121
I can read an accounts sheet,

16:24.122 --> 16:26.121
which is how I know
that most of the fund

16:26.122 --> 16:30.322
which kept mother and child afloat
came from you.

16:33.122 --> 16:36.299
I could do no less
when she was left without resources.

16:37.162 --> 16:41.801
You still mean to make me
feel guilty.

16:41.802 --> 16:43.801
Not at all.

16:43.802 --> 16:47.121
A father in his grief
is not master of himself.

16:47.122 --> 16:49.482
But, sir, you are a grandfather now.

16:51.122 --> 16:53.121
And a fine life I give the boy.

16:53.122 --> 16:57.122
And how much finer
if it included a mother's love.

16:58.962 --> 17:03.482
She took your son away from you,
but she gave you hers in return.

17:04.962 --> 17:07.121
And however much you loved
your George,

17:07.122 --> 17:10.122
I can tell you, sir,
she worships him still.

17:17.122 --> 17:19.122
There are other women, man.

18:35.642 --> 18:38.122
Welcome to my house, Mama.

18:39.122 --> 18:40.122
Darling Georgie!

18:42.122 --> 18:44.358
It's rather a dark old place,
isn't it?

18:46.322 --> 18:48.121
You and your mama
can change all that now.

18:48.122 --> 18:50.121
Jane...

18:50.122 --> 18:52.121
I have half my father's fortune

18:52.122 --> 18:56.121
and an old school friend with a
house on the Royal Crescent in Bath.

18:56.122 --> 18:59.122
Bath!

19:00.122 --> 19:03.121
So I may cross you off my list
of things to worry about.

19:03.122 --> 19:05.122
Most certainly.

19:08.122 --> 19:09.641
Goodbye, Amelia.

19:09.642 --> 19:11.122
Goodbye, Jane.

19:24.322 --> 19:27.121
Tear down those dusty curtains,
Amelia.

19:27.122 --> 19:30.122
Employ some painters,
and then go on holiday.

19:47.122 --> 19:48.641
A holiday?

19:48.642 --> 19:51.122
Can Uncle Dob come?

20:09.122 --> 20:13.122
I must most extravagantly admire
that musical gentleman's waistcoat.

20:18.962 --> 20:20.801
That rug's rather pretty.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.121
I can find you much better.

20:22.122 --> 20:26.121
The lace is so fine and so white
and half the price it is in London.

20:26.122 --> 20:28.121
May I make a present of it for you?

20:28.122 --> 20:30.240
I have no use of white lace,
William.

20:31.122 --> 20:33.121
The Pumpernickel Assembly Rooms...

20:33.122 --> 20:34.122
Uncle Dob, no!

20:34.123 --> 20:36.121
The Pumpernickel Museum.

20:36.122 --> 20:37.122
Bleurgh.

20:37.123 --> 20:40.121
Will there be suits of armour
and thumbscrews?

20:40.122 --> 20:42.121
I have my hopes so.

20:42.122 --> 20:45.122
Bliss. Whiskers galore!

20:47.122 --> 20:49.121
Dear.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.121
I shall accompany your brother

20:51.122 --> 20:53.593
to prevent further crimes against
the mode.

20:57.642 --> 21:01.121
I don't think I'm on the right page.

21:01.122 --> 21:02.122
What?

22:11.162 --> 22:14.482
You have never
played, petit monsieur.

22:16.122 --> 22:17.122
Never.

22:19.122 --> 22:21.121
Play for me.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.121
Bring me luck.

22:23.122 --> 22:25.122
Choose a part, even or odds.

22:31.482 --> 22:34.122
You are very much
like your father.

22:35.162 --> 22:37.161
How do you know about my father?

22:37.162 --> 22:39.280
What happened to your French accent?

22:47.122 --> 22:49.121
Madame gagne. The lady wins.

22:49.122 --> 22:51.121
You may take one kiss.

22:51.122 --> 22:52.122
But shush!

22:52.123 --> 22:54.122
Just a little one.

23:01.802 --> 23:03.121
Come away.

23:03.122 --> 23:04.299
My apologies, madam.

23:06.122 --> 23:07.961
Did you play?

23:07.962 --> 23:09.121
No.

23:09.122 --> 23:11.121
Your word as a gentleman,
you never will?

23:11.122 --> 23:12.322
Yes, sir.

23:16.122 --> 23:17.122
Come along, Sedley.

23:17.123 --> 23:20.122
I'll follow.
Goodbye, Dobbin.

23:42.704 --> 23:44.023
I don't play to win.

23:44.024 --> 23:46.863
I don't play at all.
No good at it.

23:46.864 --> 23:49.024
I play to forget.

23:50.024 --> 23:52.023
But it doesn't work.

23:52.024 --> 23:54.023
I cannot forget...

23:54.024 --> 23:56.023
old times.

23:56.024 --> 23:59.023
Everyone else changes,
everyone forgets.

23:59.024 --> 24:00.260
No-one has any heart.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.024
Miss Rebecca, don't be sad.

24:05.864 --> 24:10.024
Are you not also wallowing
in fond memories, Mr Joseph?

24:11.024 --> 24:14.023
Of a fairy-tale evening in Vauxhall,
perhaps?

24:14.024 --> 24:18.224
I think perhaps a veil is better
drawn over that night, Mrs Crawley.

24:20.064 --> 24:22.770
It was one of the loveliest
moments of my life.

24:24.024 --> 24:26.384
The mistakes of our youth
do haunt us!

24:29.024 --> 24:31.023
I imagine Pumpernickel
is darn provincial

24:31.024 --> 24:34.024
compared to life in Boggly Wallah,
Mr Joseph.

24:35.024 --> 24:38.023
Boggly Wallah! I, madam,
am magistrate of Bundlegunch.

24:38.024 --> 24:39.703
Bundlegunch!

24:39.704 --> 24:43.024
How utterly marvellous.

25:00.024 --> 25:03.024
This is really where you live?

25:05.024 --> 25:08.023
You have brought a little joy
tonight

25:08.024 --> 25:12.864
to a life become sad and...
so lonely.

25:43.704 --> 25:46.023
A little more bacon, Georgie?

25:46.024 --> 25:47.543
No, don't take it all!

25:47.544 --> 25:49.023
Morning.

25:49.024 --> 25:52.023
Good heavens, Jos, I can smell
your Cologne water from here!

25:52.024 --> 25:54.023
I may see you at luncheon.

25:54.024 --> 25:56.023
Missed two meals running!

25:56.024 --> 25:57.024
Is he ill?

26:24.864 --> 26:26.064
Nein. Verboten.

26:31.024 --> 26:32.024
No idea, sorry.

26:33.024 --> 26:35.023
Won't stay long.

26:35.024 --> 26:37.023
Won't steal anything.

26:37.024 --> 26:38.024
Just...

27:06.024 --> 27:07.024
Mr Sedley.

27:08.024 --> 27:09.704
Mrs Crawley.

27:18.024 --> 27:21.023
I dare say you're sorry to find me
in reduced circumstances.

27:21.024 --> 27:23.023
Well...

27:23.024 --> 27:27.024
But not, I hope,
sorry to find me at all.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.024
No, indeed.

27:34.064 --> 27:38.023
Dear heavens. To be reminded there
was once such a thing in the world

27:38.024 --> 27:39.384
as an honest man!

27:43.704 --> 27:45.023
I say, that's me!

27:45.024 --> 27:46.064
That?

27:47.704 --> 27:52.024
Mr Joseph, that is one of my
most treasured possessions.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.024
Mrs Crawley, allow me.

28:05.024 --> 28:07.023
'She is a most injured
and virtuous female'

28:07.024 --> 28:09.023
in sore need of a friend!

28:09.024 --> 28:13.083
Promise me, Jos, you will not think
of bringing that little minx here.

28:14.024 --> 28:16.023
What little mix?

28:16.024 --> 28:19.023
Marooned in Pumpernickel without
a friend in the world, Amy.

28:19.024 --> 28:20.703
An honest woman always has friends.

28:20.704 --> 28:24.410
The agonies Mrs Crawley has endured
are quite frightful to hear.

28:25.224 --> 28:27.024
Rebecca? Here?

28:29.024 --> 28:31.023
I can't see her.

28:31.024 --> 28:32.024
Don't make me see her, William.

28:32.025 --> 28:35.863
There's your answer, Jos.
She had a child.

28:35.864 --> 28:39.023
The same age as Georgie.
An angel, apparently.

28:39.024 --> 28:42.544
And he adored his mama,
as she adored him.

28:43.704 --> 28:46.863
And they tore the babe shrieking
out of her arms.

28:46.864 --> 28:49.064
But that's...
Awful.

28:50.384 --> 28:52.023
Yes.

28:52.024 --> 28:56.024
Amy, her tender heart is broken.

29:04.024 --> 29:06.024
Amelia.

29:07.024 --> 29:10.023
I mean, what exactly
is she living on?

29:10.024 --> 29:14.024
I am astonished at your lack of
charity. She is my oldest friend!

29:15.024 --> 29:18.023
Miss Sharp was not always
a good friend to you.

29:18.024 --> 29:21.023
And she is a mother. As I am.

29:21.024 --> 29:23.544
I don't expect you to understand.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.730
Get to the back of the queue.

30:36.024 --> 30:38.223
God brought him back to me.

30:38.224 --> 30:40.024
Have faith, dear Becky.

30:42.024 --> 30:43.024
I live only for the moment

30:43.025 --> 30:46.384
when I too should be reunited
with my darling son.

30:48.024 --> 30:51.023
Show me his hair.
Is it blond or dark?

30:51.024 --> 30:52.024
What?

30:52.025 --> 30:55.023
You must have a lock
of his precious hair.

30:55.024 --> 30:56.083
In a locket, or...

30:59.024 --> 31:00.024
Good morning!

31:00.025 --> 31:03.383
Lovely day, we were thinking
a walk through the woods.

31:03.384 --> 31:05.023
May I speak privately, Amelia?

31:05.024 --> 31:06.024
No, you may not.

31:07.864 --> 31:12.024
Speak, sir, we are only two women
and can be easily intimidated.

31:13.224 --> 31:16.023
It is not a pleasure for me
to perform this duty.

31:16.024 --> 31:18.024
Pray, proceed quickly, then.

31:21.024 --> 31:26.024
A woman who is separated
from her husband,

31:27.024 --> 31:30.063
who lives in a hovel and frequents
public gaming tables,

31:30.064 --> 31:33.023
is not a fit companion for a lady.
How dare you!

31:33.024 --> 31:34.864
Or for a ten-year-old child.

31:37.864 --> 31:40.543
If the charge is
unfaithfulness to my husband,

31:40.544 --> 31:44.023
I scorn it, I defy you
or anybody else to prove it.

31:44.024 --> 31:47.703
If the charge is that I am poor,
forsaken, wretched, then, yes,

31:47.704 --> 31:50.703
I am guilty of those faults
and punished for them every day.

31:50.704 --> 31:54.063
If I have any authority here...
Authority? You have none!

31:54.064 --> 31:56.023
I choose my own friends.

31:56.024 --> 31:58.024
Then, do you choose her or me?

32:02.024 --> 32:03.864
Rebecca, we are leaving.

32:10.024 --> 32:13.863
Will you stay a moment
and speak to me Amelia, please!

32:13.864 --> 32:16.024
Upon my honour, it is not about you.

32:18.024 --> 32:20.063
This is your authority, William?

32:20.064 --> 32:22.703
I have no claim to authority,

32:22.704 --> 32:25.023
but I do have a claim to be heard.

32:25.024 --> 32:27.023
That woman betrayed you
on the night before the battle...

32:27.024 --> 32:29.023
You insult my friend!

32:29.024 --> 32:32.024
And now you insult
the blessed memory of my husband.

32:33.024 --> 32:35.023
Your language is crude

32:35.024 --> 32:36.063
and violent.

32:36.064 --> 32:38.064
It disgusts me.

32:40.024 --> 32:43.023
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.

32:43.024 --> 32:45.024
Your conduct is unworthy, sir.

32:53.024 --> 32:57.064
All these years,
I have loved and watched you.

32:58.384 --> 33:01.023
Now I wonder, did I always know

33:01.024 --> 33:04.383
that the prize I'd set my life on

33:04.384 --> 33:06.024
was not worth winning?

33:08.024 --> 33:12.023
Your heart clings
so faithfully to a memory

33:12.024 --> 33:14.023
because that is all
you are capable of.

33:14.024 --> 33:18.024
Your soul is shallow.

33:20.024 --> 33:23.024
You cannot feel a love
as deep as mine.

33:25.024 --> 33:28.024
As real as mine.

33:32.064 --> 33:34.063
The truth is, you are not worthy.

33:34.064 --> 33:38.023
You never were worthy
of the lifetime of foolish love

33:38.024 --> 33:39.319
I have devoted to you.

33:40.024 --> 33:44.224
Goodbye, Amelia. Let it end.
We are both weary of it.

33:52.024 --> 33:54.024
I'm sorry.

34:12.024 --> 34:16.023
Uncle Dob!

34:16.024 --> 34:17.382
Don't go!

34:17.384 --> 34:19.023
No!

34:19.024 --> 34:21.024
Uncle Dob!

35:46.296 --> 35:47.296
Becky?

35:59.469 --> 36:00.788
Becky!

36:00.849 --> 36:02.849
Becky.

36:10.576 --> 36:12.935
So many eligible gentlemen here.

36:12.936 --> 36:15.575
Not all good husband material,
I grant you.

36:15.576 --> 36:16.576
I have my brother.

36:16.577 --> 36:18.575
Jos needs even more looking after
than you do.

36:18.576 --> 36:19.576
And my father.

36:19.577 --> 36:22.575
Hopeless! And you can't hang on
to Georgie forever, either.

36:22.576 --> 36:25.575
He'll have to go to school,
then what will you do?

36:25.576 --> 36:26.988
You must have a husband!

36:29.576 --> 36:30.576
Mrs Crawley.

36:32.576 --> 36:35.224
Dear lady,
I scarcely know what to say to you.

36:35.936 --> 36:38.995
The Governor of Coventry Island,
your poor husband...

36:40.576 --> 36:42.753
...has fallen victim to yellow fever.

36:48.576 --> 36:51.576
Even though your married life
was not, um...

36:56.576 --> 36:59.576
Please accept my most
sincere condolences.

37:00.576 --> 37:02.096
Your poor little boy.

37:18.576 --> 37:24.095
"And so, Mother, upon the death
of both my father and his brother,

37:24.096 --> 37:28.575
"and in consequence of the unmarried
situation of my female cousins,

37:28.576 --> 37:33.575
"the estate now devolves upon me,
Sir Rawdon Crawley Bart.

37:33.576 --> 37:37.575
"I write to appraise you
of this unexpected state of affairs

37:37.576 --> 37:40.095
"and to advise you that,
as duty demands,

37:40.096 --> 37:42.575
"I shall make you a small allowance.

37:42.576 --> 37:46.575
"I do not wish you to imagine
this changes anything between us.

37:46.576 --> 37:48.575
"I do not wish to see you.

37:48.576 --> 37:50.575
"I do not wish you to write to me.

37:50.576 --> 37:54.575
"On no account should you ever
attempt to make contact again.

37:54.576 --> 37:58.576
"I remain, madam,
your obedient servant."

38:00.576 --> 38:01.635
Becky Sharp's son.

38:03.256 --> 38:04.576
Lord of the Manor.

38:09.256 --> 38:12.575
Can you really call yourself
Lady Crawley now?

38:12.576 --> 38:14.575
I don't see why not.

38:14.576 --> 38:18.459
As the mother of the baronet, I
must count as some sort of dowager.

38:18.576 --> 38:21.576
I'm not sure it works like that.

38:22.576 --> 38:24.575
God, look at this.

38:24.576 --> 38:28.282
Father, please, not another
death, nobody's nerves can stand it.

38:29.096 --> 38:33.775
"The Regiment embarks with Colonel
and Mrs O'Dowd for Calcutta

38:33.776 --> 38:35.575
"within the fortnight."

38:35.576 --> 38:41.576
So, Major Dobbin returns to India.

38:42.576 --> 38:45.576
No doubt, ladies,
we will all wish him luck there.

38:51.576 --> 38:58.576
How did my sweet little daughter
grow so stubborn and so proud?

39:04.576 --> 39:06.775
Amelia, do not say my husband
is in heaven

39:06.776 --> 39:09.576
or I won't be responsible
for my actions.

39:18.936 --> 39:20.575
Amelia!

39:20.576 --> 39:21.576
Women must have husbands!

39:21.577 --> 39:25.575
And one of the best gentlemen I ever
saw has offered to you 100 times

39:25.576 --> 39:28.575
and you have rejected him, you
silly, heartless little creature!

39:28.576 --> 39:30.936
I tried to love him, I did try.

39:32.576 --> 39:34.935
Dear heaven, Amelia, if I had had
the chance of a man with a heart

39:34.936 --> 39:38.576
as big as his, and brains to match,
I'd overlook his big feet!

39:42.256 --> 39:44.609
I was 100 times on the point
of yielding.

39:46.576 --> 39:48.575
But every time, the memory...

39:48.576 --> 39:51.575
The memory of a selfish humbug, with
neither wit nor manners nor heart.

39:51.576 --> 39:52.935
George was not as he painted!

39:52.936 --> 39:55.575
A man who was weary of you,
who would have jilted you,

39:55.576 --> 39:57.575
but Dobbin forced him to keep
his word!

39:57.576 --> 39:59.575
Why would anybody do that?

39:59.576 --> 40:01.575
Heavens above, Amelia,
because he loves you!

40:01.576 --> 40:04.224
Because he wants your happiness
above his own!

40:05.576 --> 40:07.255
You always think
you're so much wiser than me.

40:07.256 --> 40:08.575
Because I am.

40:08.576 --> 40:11.575
Because you need love in your life
and I do not.

40:11.576 --> 40:15.935
And because, although you'll soon
be 30, you are still a child.

40:15.936 --> 40:19.576
Whereas I... I have been a woman
since I was eight years old.

40:22.576 --> 40:25.047
How do you think
I learnt to be a survivor?

40:29.576 --> 40:32.224
George told me himself
he never cared for you.

40:34.576 --> 40:37.575
And the week after he married you,
he chased after me.

40:37.576 --> 40:39.576
You were there, Amelia, you saw.

40:42.576 --> 40:44.575
You know his handwriting.

40:44.576 --> 40:47.575
He gave that to me.
Wanted me to run away with him.

40:47.576 --> 40:49.615
He gave it to me under your nose
at the ball,

40:49.616 --> 40:51.575
the day before the battle.

40:51.576 --> 40:54.255
The day before he was shot.
Which, by the way, served him right.

40:54.256 --> 40:56.575
I don't need to read it.

40:56.576 --> 40:59.575
I know you're right.
I've always known.

40:59.576 --> 41:05.416
I was just too proud to ever admit
that I could be such a fool.

41:08.576 --> 41:10.575
If I can persuade you

41:10.576 --> 41:12.575
to marry the major,

41:12.576 --> 41:16.576
well, in my whole life,
that is my one good deed done.

41:18.576 --> 41:21.575
So let's go home,
let's find pen and ink,

41:21.576 --> 41:24.575
let's write the major a letter
to bring him back across the sea.

41:24.576 --> 41:26.575
I'll help. I'm good at letters.
Too late.

41:26.576 --> 41:29.576
It's never too late!
I wrote to him this morning.

41:31.936 --> 41:36.576
You shameless, forward hussy,
you're worse than me!

41:52.576 --> 41:53.576
Can you see anything?

41:53.577 --> 41:55.575
Yes.

41:55.576 --> 41:57.575
What?

41:57.576 --> 41:58.576
No.

41:58.577 --> 41:59.616
Too dark.

42:01.576 --> 42:02.615
What if he doesn't come?

42:02.616 --> 42:04.911
Then it shall be no more
than I deserve.

43:08.576 --> 43:10.575
Forgive me.

43:10.576 --> 43:13.575
Dearest William,
dearest friend of my heart,

43:13.576 --> 43:15.576
forgive me if ever you can.

43:16.576 --> 43:18.224
There is nothing to forgive.

43:23.576 --> 43:24.576
Georgie.

43:56.576 --> 43:58.575
Brave soldier!

43:58.576 --> 44:00.576
Good shot, Georgie.

44:03.576 --> 44:05.575
Such a clever boy!

44:05.576 --> 44:06.576
Briggs!

44:06.577 --> 44:08.576
Sorry, Rawdy.

44:09.576 --> 44:10.935
I cannot help it.

44:10.936 --> 44:13.096
I'm so proud.

44:24.576 --> 44:26.615
He waited a very long time.

44:26.616 --> 44:29.576
And won his heart's desire.

44:31.576 --> 44:32.776
As did I.

44:39.576 --> 44:40.576
My dear.

44:44.576 --> 44:47.694
He never says a word to me
that is not kind or gentle.

44:48.576 --> 44:52.047
Nor thinks of a desire of mine
without trying to gratify it.

44:59.576 --> 45:02.165
But our daughter
is the love of his life now.

45:13.256 --> 45:16.575
None of us
is ever happy in this world.

45:16.576 --> 45:19.576
Except, of course, the major,
content at last.

45:21.576 --> 45:23.575
And he deserves it, doesn't he?

45:23.576 --> 45:27.575
But what of us? None of us
ever gets what we want.

45:27.576 --> 45:29.935
And when we do, it's not enough.

45:29.936 --> 45:33.936
I have no other moral than this
to tag to my story.

45:35.576 --> 45:37.575
What's this?

45:37.576 --> 45:39.575
Nobody is supposed to be
enjoying themselves!

45:39.576 --> 45:42.575
Nobody is supposed to come out well
from my Vanity Fair!

45:42.576 --> 45:44.576
Becky, get back here!

45:48.576 --> 45:50.575
It's going too fast!

45:50.576 --> 45:51.576
What nonsense. It's fun!

45:51.577 --> 45:53.415
What if you fall off?
I've got nine lives.

45:53.416 --> 45:55.575
What if I fall off?!

45:55.576 --> 45:57.047
We've got life insurance.
