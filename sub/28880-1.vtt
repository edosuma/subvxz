some coffee.

27:18.638 --> 27:19.870
Okay, sounds good.

27:19.905 --> 27:20.738
[giggles]

27:35.054 --> 27:36.253
Kyle.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.721
Ah, there she is.

27:37.757 --> 27:38.922
Lucie isn't here yet,

27:38.958 --> 27:40.557
I was over at the tux shop
with Craig and the groomsmen,

27:40.593 --> 27:43.193
but I figured this
was more important.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.062
Don't tell anybody
that I said this,

27:45.097 --> 27:47.398
[whispers] the wedding day
is really about the bride.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.599
You're telling me.

27:48.634 --> 27:50.768
This is my third wedding
just this year.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.369
Huh, it's my 23rd.

27:52.405 --> 27:54.438
Wow. You are in demand.

27:54.473 --> 27:55.706
Don't believe in doing
anything halfway.

27:55.741 --> 27:57.508
Really.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.009
What?

27:59.045 --> 28:01.979
You keep love at arm's length.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.114
[laughs]

28:04.150 --> 28:06.583
It's not like I don't date.

28:06.619 --> 28:08.085
Besides, unlike you,

28:08.120 --> 28:10.954
I didn't exactly have stellar
parental role models.

28:10.990 --> 28:14.491
So, how do you make such
beautiful wedding videos?

28:14.527 --> 28:16.427
I saw Allie and Dan's.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.129
Storytelling is my passion.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.731
So, tell me about
the other films,

28:20.766 --> 28:22.399
not the love stories
where you have

28:22.435 --> 28:25.302
to edit out the messy stuff.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.439
I like to shine a light
on things that don't get
enough attention.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.307
Use my films to inspire.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.509
Like what?

28:32.545 --> 28:33.510
You really want to know?

28:33.546 --> 28:35.512
Yes, I really want to know.

28:35.548 --> 28:36.780
All right.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.415
Meet me at the editing
bay tomorrow.

28:38.451 --> 28:39.483
I'll text you the address.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.952
You can get away
from "insurance."

28:41.987 --> 28:42.886
[laughs]

28:42.922 --> 28:44.788
You say insurance
like it's a bad thing.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.290
Not bad, per se.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.791
But maybe I'm shining a light
on something else

28:47.827 --> 28:49.259
that needs your attention.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.161
Hi. Sorry I'm late,
did I miss anything?

28:51.197 --> 28:52.362
(Both) No.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.464
Here are the cakes.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.465
Cake, cake.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.666
That's a lot of cake.

28:55.701 --> 28:56.567
[laughs]

29:04.477 --> 29:05.476
Nice digs.

29:05.511 --> 29:06.343
[laughs]

29:06.378 --> 29:07.878
Not what I expected.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.279
Yeah, I got a little deal
with the station.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.814
I do some freelance work
for them,

29:10.850 --> 29:13.117
and they let me
use their equipment.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.185
So, this is not
a wedding video.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.354
This is not a wedding video.

29:17.389 --> 29:21.125
Um. Uh, this is Staff Sergeant
Adam Wiley, and Emra,

29:21.160 --> 29:23.660
who incidentally,
outranks him.

29:23.696 --> 29:25.863
A little known fact, a military
dog is always

29:25.898 --> 29:28.499
one rank higher than
its fellow servicemen.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.667
It's considered
a sign of respect.

29:30.703 --> 29:32.469
As it should be.

29:32.505 --> 29:35.973
So, what are you shining
a light on here?

29:36.008 --> 29:37.007
My mother.

29:37.042 --> 29:41.211
Um, this is her, and this
is her pet project,

29:41.247 --> 29:43.380
pun definitely intended.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.315
She was in the military,
and now that she's retired,

29:45.351 --> 29:48.018
she works with American Humane
to reunite soldiers

29:48.053 --> 29:51.355
with the dogs with
whom they served.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.056
I love this.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.925
You want to talk about love?

29:54.960 --> 29:55.993
Man's best friend.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.027
These dogs save lives.

29:57.062 --> 29:57.995
Literally.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.229
Figuratively.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.597
This means something.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.599
Well, your wedding videos
mean something too.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.101
Maybe not as much to you,

30:04.136 --> 30:06.336
but you're giving people
a huge gift.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.273
Yeah, but I feel like this could
be my ticket.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.175
Has your mom seen it yet?

30:11.210 --> 30:13.076
Uh, I want to wait
till it's ready.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.211
But I get to see it today.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.113
A few clips.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.549
This is my calling card,
I gotta get it right.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.518
Sounds like that might be
a little fear talking.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.188
What, you can dish it,
but you can't take it?

30:24.223 --> 30:25.222
Let's get a coffee.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.957
[laughs]

30:26.992 --> 30:29.860
Fact is, I put a film out there
once before it was ready,

30:29.895 --> 30:32.896
and that film is sitting in
a drawer in my apartment.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.431
Well, I don't know
about your other films,

30:34.466 --> 30:36.133
but this one sounds special.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.402
Not only because of your mother
who sounds incredible,

30:38.437 --> 30:41.104
but it's a reminder of the good
that exists in our world,

30:41.140 --> 30:42.272
and we need that.

30:42.308 --> 30:45.342
But you have to put it
out there.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.279
I will finish editing
by the time we leave

30:49.315 --> 30:50.480
for Lucie's wedding weekend.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.483
That gives me a few weeks.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.484
Now, what about you?

30:54.520 --> 30:55.152
What about me?

30:55.187 --> 30:56.553
This isn't a one-sided deal.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.222
This isn't a deal at all.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.723
Oh, it's a deal now.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.159
Better practice
what you preach.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.728
Make a few pieces, put them
in the bridal shop.

31:04.763 --> 31:05.896
What if they don't sell?

31:05.931 --> 31:07.598
So what if they don't.

31:07.633 --> 31:08.599
You're re-gifting them
to a friend,

31:08.634 --> 31:10.133
what are you out,
some time and some beads?

31:10.169 --> 31:13.136
I don't use beads, I use
crystals and gemstones,

31:13.172 --> 31:15.205
I run a classy operation here.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.642
You can look at it as another
great opportunity

31:18.677 --> 31:19.743
to prove how wrong I am.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.446
Now that does intrigue me some.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.815
Do we have a deal?

31:24.850 --> 31:27.384
Okay, you got a deal.

31:31.824 --> 31:33.790
And please tell the Hankmans
I'm so sorry I had

31:33.826 --> 31:35.993
to move their appointment today,
something came up,

31:36.028 --> 31:39.429
but I am all set
for 3:30 tomorrow.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.697
And check back in with
the Eddingers

31:40.733 --> 31:43.367
on their life insurance policy,
we haven't heard back from them,

31:43.402 --> 31:46.103
and we still have to schedule
a physical.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.070
Okay, great.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.539
Well, let me know if anything
else comes up.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.942
All right, bye.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.010
[sighs]

31:53.045 --> 31:54.278
The epitome
of multitasking.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.947
You have no idea, but I promised
the bridal store that I would

31:56.982 --> 31:59.983
get the collection to them by
your fitting this afternoon.

32:00.019 --> 32:04.221
So, what changed your mind
about selling your work?

32:04.256 --> 32:07.324
I guess I just wanted to see
how I'd do,

32:07.359 --> 32:08.725
I didn't want to have any
"what ifs."

32:08.761 --> 32:11.194
And I cannot thank you both
enough for helping me.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.230
Oh, of course we'd
show up for you.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.865
You always show up for us.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.066
Just wait until your wedding.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.401
The payback you've
got coming...

32:17.436 --> 32:18.068
[laughs]

32:18.103 --> 32:19.670
Is gonna be off the charts.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.305
As soon as you find
the guy.

32:21.340 --> 32:25.142
Okay, enough of this talk.
I gotta finish soldering.

32:28.881 --> 32:30.714
(whispers) These are gorgeous.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.419
I think the bodice fits
much better now, Luce.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.187
Mmhmm.

32:37.222 --> 32:40.490
Your mother would be
so proud.

32:40.526 --> 32:43.360
I just wish she could
be here to see this day.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.928
Me too.

32:44.964 --> 32:48.365
But this is a happy time,
so we're going to be happy.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.900
[door bells jingle]

32:49.935 --> 32:52.135
As promised...

32:54.473 --> 32:57.708
<i> Becca, these are gorgeous.</i>

32:57.743 --> 33:00.377
I'll put them out today,
and we'll see how we do.

33:00.412 --> 33:01.278
Thank you.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.813
You're welcome.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.582
Hi.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.384
Honey, are you okay?

33:07.419 --> 33:08.719
You seem tired.

33:08.754 --> 33:09.653
No, I'm good.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.122
It's just, it's a lot
with the wedding,

33:12.157 --> 33:14.291
and learning to manage
the business.

33:14.326 --> 33:20.197
Becca, you have the habit of
putting everyone else first.

33:20.232 --> 33:24.067
It's your best quality
and your biggest flaw.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.470
I do hope you're taking time
for you.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.604
I am.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.439
I promise.

33:35.781 --> 33:39.983
Oh, the greatest part is
the signing on the dotted line.

33:40.019 --> 33:43.487
New business, and
it's a big contract.

33:43.522 --> 33:44.254
Yeah.

33:44.289 --> 33:45.255
Feels great.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.924
[phone rings]

33:47.960 --> 33:48.759
Hello?

33:48.794 --> 33:50.093
<i> Becca?</i>

33:50.129 --> 33:50.894
Luce?

33:50.929 --> 33:52.662
Hey, I'm in a meeting
with my mom.

33:52.698 --> 33:53.563
Hi, Luce.

33:53.599 --> 33:55.065
Hi, Aunt Joyce.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.099
I am so glad you answered,
Becks.

33:56.135 --> 33:59.803
Craig has food poisoning,
and we're in the ER.

33:59.838 --> 34:01.772
Ooh, is he okay?

34:01.807 --> 34:03.240
He's going to be fine, however,

34:03.275 --> 34:04.941
he's hooked up to
an IV right now,

34:04.977 --> 34:06.643
and we're supposed to be
on our way to the inn

34:06.678 --> 34:08.512
for our food tasting
this afternoon.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.148
Can you cover for me?
Please?

34:11.183 --> 34:12.816
I'm at work.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.785
Aunt Joyce, can Becca
please save my life

34:14.820 --> 34:16.353
and take the rest
of the day off?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.255
<i> Or else we'll all be eating</i>
<i> boxed mac and cheese</i>

34:18.290 --> 34:19.222
<i> at my wedding,</i>

34:19.258 --> 34:21.525
And Becca, you'll have
to help me cook it.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.593
Yeah, I really don't think
it's going to come to that.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.996
Of course she can go.

34:26.031 --> 34:28.331
<i> And tell Craig that we all hope</i>
<i> he feels better soon.</i>

34:28.367 --> 34:29.499
Thanks, Aunt Joyce.

34:29.535 --> 34:30.967
Will do.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.107
Kyle.

34:37.142 --> 34:38.141
What are you doing here?

34:38.177 --> 34:40.710
Uh, Lucie told me that
you were standing in for her

34:40.746 --> 34:41.678
at the food tasting,

34:41.713 --> 34:43.480
and it seemed kind of silly
to take two cars.

34:43.515 --> 34:44.481
I parked just around
the corner.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.515
Why are you even going?

34:45.551 --> 34:47.384
The bride and groom
aren't going to be there.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.352
It's all part of the story.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.621
I never want to miss an
opportunity to see you eating.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.657
So I've noticed.

34:54.993 --> 34:55.859
Your folks were okay

34:55.894 --> 34:56.927
with you leaving in
the middle of the day?

34:56.962 --> 34:59.529
Family comes first,
business is a close second.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.797
No siblings to pick up
the slack?

35:00.833 --> 35:02.032
Nope. It's just me.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.834
Ah, the only child.

35:03.869 --> 35:04.901
Great hope of the family.

35:04.937 --> 35:05.902
I know that well.

35:05.938 --> 35:06.703
You too?

35:06.738 --> 35:07.704
Oh, yep.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.739
I may not be able to carry on
the Foster name,

35:09.775 --> 35:11.308
but the legacy's
on my shoulders.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.175
I get it.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.511
I wanted a sibling
for that very reason.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.046
Also, to blame things
on when I broke stuff.

35:16.081 --> 35:17.247
[laughs]

35:17.282 --> 35:19.249
I felt the same way.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.717
Wait, are we...

35:20.752 --> 35:22.052
Are we agreeing on something?

35:22.087 --> 35:23.353
Yeah, I think we are.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.154
Weird.

35:24.189 --> 35:24.921
It feels strange.

35:24.957 --> 35:25.489
Does.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.657
Don't get used to it.

35:51.116 --> 35:52.749
Why don't you just call her

35:52.784 --> 35:54.651
and ask if they've sold
any of your stuff?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.153
She told me she would
let me know,

35:56.188 --> 35:57.487
and I don't want to bother her.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.289
It's only been three days.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.323
Maybe you don't want
to know the answer.

36:00.359 --> 36:04.027
I want to know the answer
if the answer is good.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.028
Okay, you're right.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.096
It's fear.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.532
Look, there's never been
a question what I would do

36:08.567 --> 36:11.168
with my life, this
was always the plan,

36:11.203 --> 36:12.769
and I don't want to know
the answer,

36:12.804 --> 36:15.539
because now it feels like
there's a question mark

36:15.574 --> 36:18.642
after everything, and that could
come with a lot of changes.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.511
It's like we talked about,
art is unsafe.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.747
That's what makes it exciting.

36:26.084 --> 36:27.651
Well, what about you?

36:27.686 --> 36:29.186
How's the editing going?

36:29.221 --> 36:31.288
[groans]

36:31.323 --> 36:32.522
It's a lot easier
to churn them out

36:32.558 --> 36:34.391
when you're not
personally invested.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.459
So why do you want
to tell this story?

36:38.230 --> 36:43.333
Well, um, my Mom is
an incredible woman.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.069
You know, after my father left,
she picked herself up,

36:46.104 --> 36:49.873
she raised a kid on her own,
served her country.

36:49.908 --> 36:53.677
I guess this is my way
of honouring that.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.912
I understand why it means
so much to you,

36:55.948 --> 36:58.648
but in my experience,
our work is never finished.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.017
We just stop adding beads.

37:01.053 --> 37:01.885
I thought you didn't use beads.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.154
Sometimes you need them
for a metaphor.

37:04.189 --> 37:04.988
[chuckles]

37:05.023 --> 37:06.423
Becca!

37:06.458 --> 37:08.925
Aiden, hey, it's good
to see you.

37:08.961 --> 37:12.195
I got a message that the, uh,
the groom is incapacitated,

37:12.231 --> 37:13.930
and I was to report
for duty with you.

37:13.966 --> 37:15.699
So, here I am.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.866
Rearranged my day.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.668
[laughs]

37:18.704 --> 37:20.537
Mmm. Do you know where
we're supposed to go?

37:20.572 --> 37:21.538
So sorry.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.672
Um, Kyle, videographer.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.075
This is Aiden,
Best Man.

37:27.479 --> 37:28.778
Seen you on film.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.413
Yeah, and I... I saw you
at the, uh,

37:30.449 --> 37:31.114
the engagement party.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.415
Nice to meet you,
officially.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.316
Yeah.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.453
Uh, I'm gonna go set up.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.754
Okay.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.625
<i> Mmm!</i>

37:41.660 --> 37:42.192
<i> Oh.</i>

37:42.227 --> 37:43.360
Mmm!

37:43.395 --> 37:44.094
Hey-

37:44.129 --> 37:45.128
That is so good.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.463
You need to share some
of that salmon, you know.

37:46.498 --> 37:47.264
Thank you so much.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.198
Thank you.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.332
It's really good.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.800
Do you think they would give us
another if we tell them

37:50.836 --> 37:51.935
we're not sure yet?

37:51.970 --> 37:53.536
<i> It's worth a shot.</i>

37:53.572 --> 37:54.738
Although I'm moving into
the chicken.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.039
Do you want to try
some of this?

37:56.074 --> 37:57.140
No. I'm fine.

37:57.175 --> 37:59.042
Just here to capture the magic.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.444
You know what you have to try
is this garlic mashed potato.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.513
That might be the best
I've ever had.

38:04.349 --> 38:05.315
-Wow!
-Right?

38:05.350 --> 38:06.249
That's amazing.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.083
<i> What is this sauce?</i>

38:07.119 --> 38:08.318
<i> I have no idea,</i>
<i> but it's butter.</i>

38:08.353 --> 38:09.419
Yeah, but there's truff...

38:09.454 --> 38:10.720
<i> Truffle oil, right?</i>

38:10.756 --> 38:12.088
<i> Yeah, there's definitely</i>
<i> truffle in there.</i>

38:12.124 --> 38:13.657
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.891
You know what I would like?

38:14.926 --> 38:17.294
I'd like to get a shot
of that chicken.

38:17.329 --> 38:18.161
That does look good.

38:18.196 --> 38:18.995
-Chicken?
-Yeah.

38:19.031 --> 38:19.963
Before we eat...

38:19.998 --> 38:21.398
Yeah. Could you move
over just a little bit?

38:21.433 --> 38:23.266
Oh Just a-

38:23.302 --> 38:25.268
Sorry, you know what?

38:25.304 --> 38:27.270
Let's get the chair right out
of there, actually.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.104
The whole chair?

38:28.140 --> 38:30.740
Yeah, just get
the whole chair out.

38:30.776 --> 38:31.441
All right.

38:31.476 --> 38:32.942
Yeah, there you...

38:32.978 --> 38:33.643
Like this.

38:33.679 --> 38:34.377
Yeah.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.512
Actually, you know,
why don't I?

38:35.547 --> 38:36.613
Look at that,
look at that.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.248
Why don't I scooch
over here.

38:38.283 --> 38:40.917
There, now you've got a clear
shot of all that delicious food?

38:40.952 --> 38:41.851
See? Perfect.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.254
That is better.
That's definitely better.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.756
<i> That's great, yeah.</i>
<i> Beautiful.</i>

38:46.792 --> 38:47.857
Oh, and the shrimp
is all you.

38:47.893 --> 38:48.725
I'm allergic.

38:48.760 --> 38:49.459
Oh, should we have them
take that away?

38:49.494 --> 38:50.360
I know that can
be dangerous.

38:50.395 --> 38:52.162
No, no, no, no.
No. It's not that bad.

38:52.197 --> 38:53.196
I just get hives,
that's all.

38:53.231 --> 38:53.997
No fun.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.532
Yeah.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.534
Um, let's do this.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.369
Look, I'm just going to do
a clean shot of the shrimp,

38:59.404 --> 39:00.537
just with Becca
and the shrimp.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.305
Okay?

39:02.341 --> 39:03.540
Do I smile?

39:03.575 --> 39:04.607
<i> Great idea.</i>

39:05.911 --> 39:07.577
He's thorough.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.649
[chuckles]

39:13.552 --> 39:17.787
No, I'm not taking that offer
back to my client.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.489
Look, if you think you can play
usual games with us,

39:19.524 --> 39:22.025
you're sorely mistaken.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.727
No.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.662
He seems... uh... smart.

39:25.697 --> 39:26.363
He's a nice guy.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.531
Yeah. Bit of a shark, though.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.700
If I ever need a lawyer,
I know who to call.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.036
[birds chirping]

39:33.071 --> 39:35.205
Wow. You know, I should grab
some establishing shots

39:35.240 --> 39:36.439
of this place for the video.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.742
We're going to be here for three
days on the wedding weekend.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.377
Yeah, but I have to follow
the bride around.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.245
Lucie is not going to be one
of those brides,

39:42.280 --> 39:43.713
she has promised.

39:43.749 --> 39:44.848
They all promise.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.015
[laughs]

39:46.051 --> 39:47.817
You want to come with?

39:48.420 --> 39:49.586
Don't insult me,
Andrew.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.654
Yes.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.823
Very much.

39:56.361 --> 39:59.195
So how is it you've been
a bridesmaid nine times,

39:59.231 --> 40:00.096
and never a bride?

40:00.132 --> 40:02.031
Soon to be ten times.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.867
That's a lot of dresses
you'll never wear again.

40:03.902 --> 40:04.868
One was a pantsuit.

40:04.903 --> 40:05.935
I could open up a shop,

40:05.971 --> 40:07.404
rent 'em out for
special occasions.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.305
[laughs]

40:12.144 --> 40:15.211
Everyone I know has
this magical story

40:15.247 --> 40:16.880
when it comes to love.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.114
They just knew.

40:18.150 --> 40:20.550
And that's what you want?

40:20.585 --> 40:23.887
My last boyfriend, Dylan,
he was a wonderful guy,

40:23.922 --> 40:26.723
and everything
was perfectly fine.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.558
He was ready to get married.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.427
So, what happened?

40:30.462 --> 40:32.729
He wanted more than
just perfectly fine,

40:32.764 --> 40:33.863
and he deserved that, too.

40:33.899 --> 40:39.269
I don't think it's unreasonable
to want to be sure.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.271
In my experience, everybody
has a magical story

40:41.306 --> 40:42.472
for the interview.

40:42.507 --> 40:44.641
And then you delve deeper, and
you see that we're just really

40:44.676 --> 40:47.377
good at rewriting the fairy tale
into our history.

40:47.412 --> 40:50.647
You still don't believe
in that kind of love.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.881
I don't know.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.451
I thought that I had defied
the odds of my parents' divorce

40:54.486 --> 40:57.754
when I met my ex-girlfriend,
Ellie.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.456
We had that instant
connection thing,

40:59.491 --> 41:02.959
she was the one, and she was
on the same page.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.261
So, what happened?

41:05.297 --> 41:06.963
Page turned for her.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.965
It's funny how you can be
so sure about something,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.233
and so wrong.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.468
Hmm.

41:11.503 --> 41:14.571
It must've been so hard.

41:14.606 --> 41:19.075
But you can't shut down just
because of one experience.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.243
And if you spend all your energy

41:20.278 --> 41:21.644
looking for something
so specific,

41:21.680 --> 41:26.449
you might not recognize it
when it arrives.

Hi Holly.

41:52.377 --> 41:54.310
So, I've been meaning
to call you,

41:54.346 --> 41:55.845
but we've been so busy.

41:55.881 --> 41:57.213
We've been swamped.

Wait, well that's amazing!

42:06.558 --> 42:09.325
Um, I... I don't even know
what to say.

42:09.361 --> 42:10.994
Say you'll make more for us.

42:11.029 --> 42:14.297
<i> And I've told our jewelry</i>
<i> distributor about you.</i>

42:14.332 --> 42:17.667
If she likes your work,
you're on your way.

42:17.702 --> 42:18.568
Really?

42:18.603 --> 42:20.537
But she needs to see
a full collection,

right to work.

just became an
exclamation point.

42:40.392 --> 42:43.293
Maybe I can do both.

1:15:56.085 --> 1:15:56.918
[laughs]

1:15:56.953 --> 1:15:57.785
I'll tell him tomorrow.

1:15:57.820 --> 1:16:00.021
Let's let him enjoy
the wedding tonight.

1:16:00.056 --> 1:16:01.656
Thank you, Mom.

1:16:06.262 --> 1:16:10.631
Hey. There you are.

1:16:10.667 --> 1:16:11.699
Becca, I can't talk
right now.

1:16:11.734 --> 1:16:14.302
Just hear me out, please.

1:16:14.337 --> 1:16:16.070
Look, I'm sorry
if I overstepped,

1:16:16.105 --> 1:16:18.606
but your movie is ready.

1:16:18.641 --> 1:16:20.908
With all due respect, that
wasn't your decision to make.

1:16:20.944 --> 1:16:23.444
A few tweaks isn't going to
change the heart of the story,

1:16:23.479 --> 1:16:25.546
which is beautiful.

1:16:25.582 --> 1:16:27.915
And even though my uncle
only saw the first few minutes,

1:16:27.951 --> 1:16:29.150
he was intrigued.

1:16:29.185 --> 1:16:31.052
Of course he's going to say
that, standing in front of you.

1:16:31.087 --> 1:16:32.720
You're family. You asked him
for a favour.

1:16:32.755 --> 1:16:34.488
He asked me what I was watching.

1:16:34.524 --> 1:16:36.824
I reluctantly shared it
with him.

1:16:36.859 --> 1:16:38.259
But he doesn't mince words.

1:16:38.294 --> 1:16:40.294
He was impressed.
He is impressed.

1:16:43.466 --> 1:16:45.333
Look, something powerful
has happened

1:16:45.368 --> 1:16:49.971
over the past five months,
and I think it has for you too.

1:16:50.006 --> 1:16:52.006
You can deny yourself
of what's meant to be,

1:16:52.041 --> 1:16:55.843
but I'm not going
to do that anymore.

1:16:55.878 --> 1:17:00.414
And I will never apologize
for what I see in you.

1:17:14.864 --> 1:17:17.298
Always thinking, ruminating,
aren't you?

1:17:17.333 --> 1:17:18.432
Well, you gotta admit,

1:17:18.468 --> 1:17:21.836
this is a pretty great place
to process your thoughts.

1:17:21.871 --> 1:17:22.803
[sighs]

1:17:22.839 --> 1:17:24.038
Yeah.

1:17:24.073 --> 1:17:28.876
I've come to a few new
revelations here myself,
actually.

1:17:31.247 --> 1:17:36.684
Aiden, I think you are
a great guy.

1:17:36.719 --> 1:17:38.419
But?

1:17:38.454 --> 1:17:42.023
But my heart belong
somewhere else,

1:17:42.058 --> 1:17:45.593
and even though I don't think
that's going anywhere,

1:17:45.628 --> 1:17:47.662
it wouldn't be fair
to either of us

1:17:47.697 --> 1:17:52.333
if I pursued something
with you.

1:17:52.368 --> 1:17:55.036
I appreciate your honesty.

1:17:55.071 --> 1:18:01.842
Uh, and whoever this guy is,
he is crazy for not seeing

1:18:01.878 --> 1:18:04.545
what's right in front of him.

1:18:07.050 --> 1:18:08.582
<i> There you are.</i>

1:18:08.618 --> 1:18:09.316
Aiden.

1:18:09.352 --> 1:18:11.886
The guys need you
for a photo.

1:18:11.921 --> 1:18:13.688
Okay.

1:18:15.091 --> 1:18:17.358
[sighs]

1:18:27.603 --> 1:18:32.039
[ambient chattering]

1:18:45.955 --> 1:18:47.421
Hello!

1:18:48.524 --> 1:18:50.291
Hello!

1:18:51.661 --> 1:18:52.760
[laughs]

1:18:52.795 --> 1:18:54.628
I had a speech prepared
tonight,

1:18:54.664 --> 1:18:56.063
as you know I always do.

1:18:56.099 --> 1:18:58.132
[laughs]

1:18:58.167 --> 1:19:02.436
But I think I want this one to
come straight from the heart.

1:19:03.673 --> 1:19:06.340
I've always said that love
should be instant

1:19:06.375 --> 1:19:08.342
and effortless.

1:19:08.377 --> 1:19:10.945
When you find that person,
there's no struggle,

1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:12.646
there' s no drama,

1:19:12.682 --> 1:19:16.951
you get to be you
and your loved for it.

1:19:16.986 --> 1:19:21.589
But I think I was wrong
about the instant part.

1:19:21.624 --> 1:19:24.125
Watching Lucie and Craig
grow together

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:25.059
over the past few years,

1:19:25.094 --> 1:19:29.163
I see that true love
is about continually

1:19:29.198 --> 1:19:31.332
lifting each other up.

1:19:31.367 --> 1:19:34.368
It's about inspiring each other
to be better

1:19:34.403 --> 1:19:37.171
than you ever thought
you could be.

1:19:37.206 --> 1:19:39.807
The kind of love where you
would risk everything

1:19:39.842 --> 1:19:42.309
to see that person
achieve his dreams,

1:19:42.345 --> 1:19:44.979
because that's how much
you believe in him.

1:19:45.014 --> 1:19:48.549
The kind of love that
makes you feel whole.

1:19:48.584 --> 1:19:52.052
Lucie and Craig have found
this kind of love,

1:19:52.088 --> 1:19:53.821
and we should all be
so lucky,

1:19:53.856 --> 1:19:58.392
so let's raise our glasses
to Lucie and Craig,

1:19:58.427 --> 1:20:02.396
may you have a beautiful
life together.

1:20:02.431 --> 1:20:03.898
(Guests) Lucie and Craig!

All of it.

But mostly the part about
how taking risks is easier
