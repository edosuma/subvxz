00:46.839 --> 00:49.674
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa...

00:52.261 --> 00:57.181
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa,
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.017
I do.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.274
- Lois, the room looks beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:06.358 --> 01:09.402
The candles have been replaced
by the mini-lamps you asked for.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.405
- So no fire hazard.
- Great. Did we sanitize these?

01:13.198 --> 01:15.408
The best man is in the house!

01:16.618 --> 01:18.828
- Oh, my God!
- Sandy, are you okay?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.080
JorgÃ©, ice. The best man went down.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.874
Dance floor's a Slip 'N Slide, dude.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.876
I thought I told them
not to wax this.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.254
23% of the guests are over 70.
I don't want anyone breaking a hip.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.214
Don't worry,
I'm gonna take care of it.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.633
I analyze risk for a living.
It's my job to worry.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.887
Let me do the worrying,
because you got to get married.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.430
I'm good.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.641
You got my note that Harry Bard
at table 7's allergic to seafood?

01:40.726 --> 01:42.685
His chicken will go nowhere
near the fish.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.021
We're putting the finishing touches
on the cake.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.731
This looks great.
Lisa is gonna love it.

01:46.732 --> 01:47.190
This looks great.
Lisa is gonna love it.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.483
Hit me, dude.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.242
Aren't you that kid
from Crocodile Tears?

01:58.327 --> 02:00.286
That's right. I'm Sandy Lyle.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.246
I saw that movie in high school.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.207
That bagpipe scene
was the funniest shit.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.918
We had a good time on that picture.
Want an autograph?

02:07.002 --> 02:08.127
No, thanks.

02:08.211 --> 02:12.048
It's good to see you, man.
I thought you died 15 years ago.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.426
Ah! Nah.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.429
I'm very much alive.
I've been stage-acting.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.181
- Getting back to my roots.
- We should...

02:20.265 --> 02:22.350
They're making
an E! True Hollywood Story on me.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.514
That'll clear up questions.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.478
They're really doing a show
about your life?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.939
I got a camera crew
following me the next few weeks.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.857
- It's gonna be huge.
- Cool!

02:29.942 --> 02:32.318
Reuben! Two-minute warning.
Lisa's on her way down.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.486
Thanks.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.404
- Look, Reuben.
- Yeah?

02:36.031 --> 02:37.281
I'm asking you this

02:37.366 --> 02:39.408
because you're my oldest friend
in the world.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.370
- And I'm your wingman.
- Okay. What?

02:43.789 --> 02:46.290
Are you sure you want to do this?

02:47.125 --> 02:50.503
Sandy, there's not a doubt
in my mind.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.505
Okay?

02:52.589 --> 02:55.883
I found the perfect woman.
We're totally in love.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.679
My life's working out
just like I planned.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.639
Let's go get married.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.393
Mazel tov!

03:05.769 --> 03:07.770
Go on. Kiss each other.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.443
Big smile, everyone!

03:14.987 --> 03:16.571
Come on, you love each other.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.239
Smile, Grandma.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.700
Having fun.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.794
Hello, everybody.
I'm Stan Indursky, Reuben's boss.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.546
Thank you. You're very kind.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.799
Now Reub's not the sort of fellow
to brag about his own success

03:36.925 --> 03:38.801
so I'm going to do it for him.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.803
The fact is this young man here,

03:40.929 --> 03:43.806
is the best
risk assessment expert

03:43.974 --> 03:47.059
in this whole meshugaas
we call the insurance business.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.979
Irving, Vivian,
you've raised a wonderful son.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.731
Let's hear it for him.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.275
Reuben, Lisa, let me just say...

03:56.486 --> 04:00.323
that I would insure your marriage
any day of the week.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.075
Mazel, you two. Good things.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.915
Oh, and, Lisa, don't tire him out
too bad on the honeymoon.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.459
I need this kid fresh
when he gets back.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.629
Mazel! Good things.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.172
You know, the truth is,

04:16.298 --> 04:19.300
I've been waiting for this day
my entire life.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.260
About four-and-a-half years ago

04:21.345 --> 04:24.096
I met a real-estate agent
named Lisa Kramer...

04:24.473 --> 04:27.016
who showed me an apartment,
which I rented...

04:27.100 --> 04:28.517
just so she'd go out with me.

04:28.602 --> 04:32.104
- I gave him a good price.
- Not good enough. She's a killer.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.773
No, seriously...

04:33.941 --> 04:37.026
after about a month of dating,
I knew she was the one.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.279
And I couldn't be happier

04:40.364 --> 04:43.866
that on this day that I've been
dreaming about for so long...

04:44.326 --> 04:47.328
the woman I'm standing next to
is you.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.189
Oh, my goodness!

05:16.566 --> 05:18.985
- Look at this place!
- I lost my shoe!

05:19.486 --> 05:21.737
- So pretty!
- It's beautiful.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.072
What?

05:33.041 --> 05:35.251
- How's your bruise?
- It's okay.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.004
You know, it's a little sore.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.672
They really should tell you...

05:39.756 --> 05:42.258
if they let Komodo dragons
run around the hotel.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.592
Really.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.096
Oh!

05:47.180 --> 05:49.849
- How about this one?
- Let's see.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.478
"Recently renovated colonial
in Montclair, three-bedroom..."

05:54.604 --> 05:57.523
Sweetie, we took a virtual tour
of this one on the Internet.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.900
It was perfect,
but just a little pricey.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.861
Oh, right. That's right.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.739
It's probably off the market anyway.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.658
- Why do you say that?
- Because I bought it.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.828
You what?

06:11.621 --> 06:13.289
I bought it!

06:17.961 --> 06:21.505
Reuben, I'm in shock.
You don't do things like that.

06:21.590 --> 06:24.008
- You love it, right?
- I do, but, Reuby...

06:24.092 --> 06:27.303
- We have a house!
- Oh, my God, we have a house! Honey!

06:28.221 --> 06:28.304
Hi. Hello.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.597
Hi. Hello.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.558
How's it going?

06:34.478 --> 06:36.228
It's going great. Thank you.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.314
I see you gang
are new to the island,

06:38.440 --> 06:40.232
I want to come have a meet with you.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.652
I show you my boat. That is
my boat there on the sandbar.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.489
It's very big.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.574
Yeah, it's pretty good size.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.577
So, tell me true,
are you guys for scuba?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.080
What does that mean?

06:54.164 --> 06:57.083
I'm the unofficial scuba king
of St. Barts.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.668
So if you're for scuba,
I take you out on the boat,

06:59.795 --> 07:03.255
I show you the coral reef
and we have like a scuba party?

07:03.340 --> 07:07.176
That sounds great, but we're not
certified, so we'll have to pass.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.762
That is no biggie.
I get you resort-certified...

07:09.846 --> 07:11.180
couple of hours.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.849
- I have always wanted to try it.
- Yeah?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.977
Good. My name is Claude.
What is you guys' name?

07:17.104 --> 07:20.106
My name is Reuben.
This is my wife, Lisa.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.274
I am here all afternoon.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.194
All right, au revoir, Reuben, Lisa.
Solid.

07:25.862 --> 07:26.946
Solid.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.824
Hi. Hello. How's it going?

07:36.039 --> 07:37.373
Reuben! Lisa!

07:38.542 --> 07:40.292
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.171
- Isn't this exciting?
- It is. It's fun.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.634
You know what? I think
I'm gonna skip the scuba diving.

07:48.718 --> 07:52.388
Reuben, no. You called eight hotels.
They all said this guy was the best.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.558
I know, but you know how I am
about boats, and I feel queasy.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.143
Your stomach's acting funny?

07:57.227 --> 08:00.729
It's okay now, but you know
how it gets. So why don't you go?

08:00.856 --> 08:03.065
We're on our honeymoon.
I won't go without you.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.402
No, you've been wanting to try this.
I want you to go, okay?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.488
It will be fun.
I'll pick you up at 4:00, all right?

08:09.573 --> 08:11.699
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.833
You're not for scuba, Reuben?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.669
No, Claude, I'm gonna go
run some errands in town.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.672
But you guys go. Have fun.
Can I talk to you for a second?

08:26.756 --> 08:28.090
Of course.

08:30.594 --> 08:34.429
Listen, this woman means more to me
than anything else in the world,

08:34.556 --> 08:35.847
so be careful.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.518
Scuba can be very dangerous
if proper precautions aren't taken.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.604
Reuben, look to me in my eyeball.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.856
I promise you I take care of Lisa

08:43.940 --> 08:46.275
as if she were
my own flesh and blood.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.444
- Thank you.
- Okay?

08:49.404 --> 08:51.071
- Solid.
- Okay, solid.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.534
All right? Are you ready?

08:55.619 --> 08:57.536
Yeah. Will a little boat come over...

08:57.621 --> 08:58.746
Ally oop.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.628
Au revoir, Reuben.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.797
Bye-bye, honey! I love you!
- I love you!

09:27.651 --> 09:28.943
Lisa!

09:29.819 --> 09:31.153
Claude!

09:32.072 --> 09:33.280
Guys?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.407
Hello!

09:36.952 --> 09:38.160
Lisa?

09:42.123 --> 09:43.540
Knock-knock!

09:45.669 --> 09:47.211
Oh, my God.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.880
- I love you!
- Ooh, la la!

09:50.632 --> 09:52.091
Oh, my God!

09:52.175 --> 09:55.511
Holy shit, Reuben!
This is not what it looks like.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.680
You're staying on the island
with Claude?

09:57.806 --> 09:59.765
I'm a little confused
right now, Reuben.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.351
I think I need a little time
to figure things out.

10:02.477 --> 10:05.145
What did you do to her?
Did you mess with her oxygen tanks?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.522
I did nothing, Leuben.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.607
My name's not Leuben! It is Reuben.

10:08.692 --> 10:12.486
Look, we had a scuba, we talk about
life, we drink some white wine.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.239
We cannot help it.
It is like love at first sight.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.075
She make like the fire
in my trouser.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.036
What he's trying to say, Reuben...

10:21.162 --> 10:24.540
is that we didn't plan it.
It just... It happened.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.167
It's like the story of the hippo.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.545
I'm not familiar with that story.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.755
The hippopotamus is not born going,

10:31.881 --> 10:34.383
"Cool bean, I am a hippo."
No way, JosÃ©.

10:34.509 --> 10:38.304
So he tried to paint a stripe
on himself to be like the zebra

10:38.388 --> 10:39.596
but he fool no one.

10:39.723 --> 10:43.267
Then he tried to put the spot
on his skin to be like the leopard.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.394
But everyone know he is a hippo.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.229
So, at certain point,

10:47.355 --> 10:50.190
he look himself in the mirror
and he just say,

10:50.275 --> 10:52.443
"Hey, I am a hippopotamus...

10:52.569 --> 10:54.737
"and there is nothing
I can do about it."

10:54.863 --> 10:58.699
And, as soon as he accepts this,
he live life happy.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.951
Happy as a hippo.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.912
You understand?

11:06.249 --> 11:08.250
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Reuben, no!

11:10.045 --> 11:12.087
No, Reuben. This is not the way.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.761
- You're gonna be fine, Reuben.
- No, I'm not gonna be fine.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.222
I'm not gonna be fine at all.

11:22.557 --> 11:25.434
Don't come back to me
when you change your mind,

11:25.560 --> 11:27.519
because this ship has sailed.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.006
Hey, Tina.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.926
Hey, Mitch.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.970
Hey, Reub.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.140
- Cheryl.
- Hey.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.150
Indursky & Sons, how may I help you?

13:02.157 --> 13:03.198
What?

13:09.247 --> 13:11.039
How does everyone know about this?

13:11.124 --> 13:14.960
Your mother called Mr. Indursky
and told him what happened.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.714
- I am so sorry, Reuben.
- Thanks, Gladys.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.675
- Come here.
- Okay. Thank you.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.470
- All right.
- I know.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.934
Hey, there he is!
The big man's back.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.855
Come on in here, I want to spitball
something with you.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.358
Can you give me a minute?
I'm just going to the men's room.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.986
I'll join you.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.033
I heard about your honeymoon.
Just terrible.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.704
I knew that girl was a slut
the second I met her.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.790
Well, it's kind of complicated.
I mean, there's...

13:53.875 --> 13:55.167
Don't make excuses.

13:55.251 --> 13:59.171
She's a dime-store hooker and always
will be. Just put it behind you.

13:59.547 --> 14:03.634
Speaking of which, you ever hear
of a guy named Leland Van Lew?

14:05.011 --> 14:07.763
Leland Van Lew...
Yeah, Australian guy, right?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.933
- Made the cover of Forbes last year?
- Exactly.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.728
He started one of those high-tech,
modem-scrotum,

14:14.812 --> 14:18.023
God-only-knows-what-they-do
companies anyway. Jesus Christ.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.858
They want to take
the company public

14:19.943 --> 14:23.487
and to remain CEO of the company,
guess what he needs?

14:23.571 --> 14:25.739
- Life insurance.
- Bingo was his name.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.701
- You want me to check him out?
- Yeah. There's just one catch.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.498
This Van Lew has a reputation
as a cowboy.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.501
Apparently, he's one
of these extreme-sports nuts.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.045
So, it's a long shot

14:40.129 --> 14:42.589
but if you can
pull this thing together,

14:42.674 --> 14:44.758
there might be
a lot of dough in it for us,

14:44.842 --> 14:47.761
an extra bonus for you,
help you with those house payments.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.056
All right. Let's make sure
he checks out first, and...

14:51.140 --> 14:56.019
You see? This is why you're the only
one I can trust with these jobs.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.689
I was worried you'd been
through hell and back

14:58.773 --> 15:00.566
with that whore wife of yours.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.651
You sure you don't need
some more time off?

15:02.735 --> 15:03.735
Mmm-hmm.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.154
- I'm good. I'm fine.
- Absolutely sure?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.949
All right, good things.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.762
Excuse me.
This is private property.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.932
Yeah, I know.
I just bought this house.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.225
I move in next month.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.478
Oh, sure. Mr. Phifer, right?

15:38.563 --> 15:41.356
Feffer. But you can
just call me Reuben.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.651
- Okay. Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.697
Sorry about your wife, Reuben.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.872
First ofall, I want
to thank everybody for coming out.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.541
This has been
an incredible day and night.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.837
It's just so great to see all these
people, friends and family.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.675
To tell you the truth, I've waited
for this day my entire life.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.846
I'm so sorry, Reuben.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.723
Thanks, Sandy.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.517
- I'm here for you, brother.
- Thank you.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.062
- We're rolling.
- Sound speed.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.648
- What the hell is this?
- Remember Dustin and Vic?

16:22.732 --> 16:25.567
They're doing the
E! True Hollywood Story on me.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.736
Sorry about your wife.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.822
- Sandy, you want us over here?
- By the table.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.407
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.496
- Is this better?
- Yeah, thanks.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.831
Look, forget it.
I'm not going to a party?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.166
What do you think will happen?

16:41.250 --> 16:44.169
Lisa'll waltz through that door,
saying she made a mistake?

16:44.253 --> 16:46.171
No, of course not, I'm just...

16:46.255 --> 16:48.840
I'm trying to make sense
out of what the hell she did.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.259
What can I say,
you're my best friend.

16:51.719 --> 16:52.761
You're my partner...

16:52.887 --> 16:54.346
Hold on. Let me see something.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.015
You're my wife!
Man, it feels good to say that!

16:57.100 --> 16:58.350
And

17:00.061 --> 17:03.105
you're my wife!
Man, it feels good to say that!

17:08.736 --> 17:11.613
Check out her expression.
She's terrified.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.286
- She's smiling.
- I'm a student of acting.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.874
She's faking it.
The woman got spooked.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.544
She needed to explore,
which is exactly what you'll do.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.380
You've been gifted with freedom.
Don't turn your back on it.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.049
I don't want freedom!
I want to be married!

17:31.134 --> 17:32.551
I bought a goddamn house!

17:32.635 --> 17:35.595
I got to move out of this apartment
in, like, six weeks!

17:36.973 --> 17:40.142
Look at her.
She's not thinking about having

17:40.226 --> 17:42.060
a deep, committed relationship

17:42.145 --> 17:44.938
with a complex individual
like yourself.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.151
- She's not?
- No!

17:49.277 --> 17:53.071
She's daydreaming about having hot,
shallow sex with a French nudist!

17:53.156 --> 17:56.908
"Oh, I'm hugging.
Oh, I love you so much." Liar!

17:57.827 --> 17:59.828
Whose party? Is this again?

17:59.954 --> 18:02.998
It's an art opening
for this Dutch guy, Jost.

18:03.416 --> 18:07.002
His art sucks, but he used
to sell me really good pot.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.465
Oh, man, I'm so frigging horny.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.098
Just don't leave me alone.

18:20.183 --> 18:22.684
I haven't been to a party? By myself
in a long time.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.354
Relax. I'm your wingman.
I'll be by your side the whole time.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.024
So what do we do?

18:29.108 --> 18:32.110
Do we get a drink
or take a lap around the...

18:34.655 --> 18:35.864
Sandy?

18:49.045 --> 18:50.837
- More wine?
- Sure.

18:52.882 --> 18:53.882
Thank you.

18:54.008 --> 18:57.219
This party? 's so boring,
and there are no cute guys.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.013
I haven't noticed.
I'm appreciating the art.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.265
I'm not looking for cute guys.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.976
You swore off men
since dumping your last boyfriend?

19:05.061 --> 19:07.646
He was not my boyfriend.
We went out for three days.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.564
- It was two months!
- Really?

19:19.742 --> 19:22.077
I hope he doesn't have
to buy that now.

19:29.502 --> 19:33.255
Oh, my God! I think I know that guy.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.602
- You're Reuben Feffer, right?
- Yes?

19:47.895 --> 19:50.272
I'm Polly Prince.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.275
We went to junior high
or middle school

19:53.359 --> 19:55.360
or whatever it's called, together.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.195
- Yeah! Polly Prince!
- Yes.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.031
It's coming back to me now.
You left before high school.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.368
After seventh grade,
my mum and I moved to Michigan.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.872
- Now you live here in New York?
- Moved here a few months ago.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.707
- So, you know.
- Wow.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.547
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah, that's Roxanne.

20:15.631 --> 20:20.385
She does that with bread,
wine bottles, and... Anyway...

20:20.803 --> 20:22.053
So what's your deal?

20:22.138 --> 20:26.099
You've got to be married
with kids and the whole thing.

20:26.267 --> 20:30.145
No, I'm not. I'm single.
I haven't taken the plunge.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.647
Can I talk to you for a sec?

20:32.732 --> 20:36.651
Sandy, this is Polly Prince.
Remember? From middle school?

20:36.777 --> 20:38.653
- How you doing?
- Wow.

20:38.946 --> 20:42.824
Okay, Sandy Lyle,
last time I saw you,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.827
you were playing bagpipes
in that movie.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.829
Croco Tears. Yep, that's me.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.665
Polly! Can I have a word with you?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.751
- Sorry.
- Excuse us.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.502
What happened to you?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.755
I'm in a situation here.
We must leave now.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.423
Can we stay a couple more minutes?

20:58.507 --> 21:01.092
Dude, no. This is serious.
I just sharted.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.094
I don't know what that means.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.764
I tried to fart, and a little
shit came out. I sharted.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.349
Now let's go.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.187
You're the most disgusting person
I've ever met in my life.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.106
You have to walk around
and pour wine.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.692
Polly? Focus for one second, okay?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.323
So, hey, I got to go circulate.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.453
So, Sandy, you're good though?
You're still acting?

21:28.537 --> 21:31.206
I am.
Yeah, it's going incredibly well.

21:31.499 --> 21:34.960
I'm actually headlining a new
revival of Jesus Christ Superstar.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.544
That's great!

21:36.629 --> 21:39.214
- It was really good seeing you guys.
- You, too.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.299
- See you!
- All right. Bye, Polly.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.717
Be good.

21:42.843 --> 21:43.969
More wine?

21:44.470 --> 21:47.889
Polly Prince. It's funny, huh?
Seeing her.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.976
- Are you okay?
- Great, thank you.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.480
She looks good.

21:56.315 --> 21:56.481
Let it rain!

21:56.482 --> 21:57.732
Let it rain!

21:59.485 --> 22:01.236
I did a lot of thinking
last night...

22:01.362 --> 22:03.238
and there's something
I'm excited about.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.324
What's up? Nice. Let it rain!

22:08.077 --> 22:10.161
I feel like I might be ready
to move on,

22:10.246 --> 22:12.205
get my life back on track.

22:12.415 --> 22:15.917
So, I am going to ask
Polly Prince on a date.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.920
That's a mistake!
She's not right for you, dude.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.880
Rain dance!

22:21.757 --> 22:24.009
You guys want to play some twos?

22:24.093 --> 22:26.261
Actually, we're in
the middle of a conversation.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.054
Did you douche bags
bring your "A" game?

22:28.764 --> 22:29.848
What was that?

22:29.932 --> 22:31.683
I'm just messing
with you, Sasquatch.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.351
Let's get it on.

22:34.395 --> 22:37.939
Pick and roll! Take it rough!
Outlet!

22:38.441 --> 22:39.899
Rain dance!

22:40.443 --> 22:41.860
Sandy, come on.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.363
I got him.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.782
White Chocolate!

22:48.951 --> 22:50.285
Raindrops!

22:51.620 --> 22:53.121
Old school!

22:54.790 --> 22:56.791
T. Time-out.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.252
I'm burning. My lungs are burning.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.463
Time-out.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.382
So why do you think
Polly's so wrong for me?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.635
You don't even know this girl.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.055
You haven't seen her
since seventh grade.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.389
How different could she be?

23:11.474 --> 23:13.475
She was a senior delegate
at the Model UN,

23:13.559 --> 23:15.477
she was in the chess club,
a Mathlete.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.395
Her yearbook stats are impressive.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.647
Did you see the tattoo on her back?

23:19.732 --> 23:20.982
Yeah. So what?

23:21.108 --> 23:24.652
Mathletes don't wear body art
like that. Enough said. Ball in!

23:24.945 --> 23:28.406
I really feel like I ran
into Polly for a reason. Really.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.408
I'm sorry if you don't agree.

23:30.493 --> 23:33.286
But I believe
in a little thing called destiny.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.291
You guys ready?

23:39.251 --> 23:43.004
You know what? You think maybe
you could put your shirt back on?

23:43.506 --> 23:45.173
You guys ready to play?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.681
Good shot.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.434
Could I have the ball for a second?

24:03.859 --> 24:05.693
You know what? Could we switch?

24:05.820 --> 24:09.781
I'd rather not. I just found out
how to cover this man right here.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.199
Let's play.

24:35.391 --> 24:39.727
Can I get the number for a Polly
Prince, please? Prince with a "P."

24:42.898 --> 24:45.400
Okay, great.
Can I get the address as well?

24:58.622 --> 24:59.706
Hello.

25:07.715 --> 25:09.048
Oh, shit!

25:10.759 --> 25:12.719
- Hi. This is Reuben.
- No!

25:12.803 --> 25:15.013
I'm unable to get to the phone
right now

25:15.097 --> 25:17.473
but please leave a detailed message
after the beep.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.934
If you're calling for Lisa...

26:12.196 --> 26:14.197
Gladys, I got to call you back.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.870
This is so funny.
I didn't know you lived down here.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.915
Yeah, I do.
Do you live around here, too?

26:23.999 --> 26:26.668
No, I don't. I don't live down here.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.381
Hey. Did you call me last night?

26:33.342 --> 26:35.051
No. I don't think so.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.386
Are you sure?

26:36.512 --> 26:39.764
Because I got a hang-up
so I did that star-69 thingy.

26:39.848 --> 26:43.017
And I swore
I got your answering machine.

26:43.978 --> 26:46.062
Really? I heard that
from a few people,

26:46.188 --> 26:48.815
so maybe the phone lines
got crossed or something.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.859
- You doing some shopping?
- Oh, yeah.

26:52.361 --> 26:55.697
Gosh, I spent like $200
on this loofah.

26:56.365 --> 26:59.701
It's supposed to be specially made
in Sweden or something.

26:59.827 --> 27:00.868
Wow.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.247
Would you like to go
to dinner sometime?

27:05.207 --> 27:08.876
Oh, yeah. Okay.
You know, I'm not sure.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.212
Okay. Really?

27:11.338 --> 27:13.923
Not that I wouldn't. I'd like to.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.634
It would be great
to catch up on stuff and all that.

27:16.719 --> 27:19.220
I just got to check my schedule.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.098
All right, how about
I give you my card?

27:22.224 --> 27:23.683
Here you go.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.228
On the back I've written
my home and my cell number.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.230
- There's also a fax number.
- Right on.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.024
And a pager number, too.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.901
"Reuben Feffer,
Senior Risk Assessment Analysist."

27:34.028 --> 27:35.945
- Right. Analyst.
- Analyst.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.281
Right.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.450
All right.

27:42.411 --> 27:43.911
See you.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.376
- See you.
- See you later.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.302
Leland Van Lew's office.
This is Deborah.

27:59.428 --> 28:02.972
Reuben Feffer from Indursky & Sons
calling for Mr. Van Lew.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.642
Right. The insurance man.
He's in the hospital.

28:06.727 --> 28:09.187
He got bit swimming
with great whites.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.230
- Swimming with who?
- Great white sharks.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.107
But don't worry.
It was only a flesh wound.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.780
He's due in Los Angeles
next week.

28:18.906 --> 28:22.033
- Should I set something up for then?
- Could you hang on, please?

28:22.117 --> 28:23.618
No worries.

28:23.952 --> 28:27.163
- Hi, Reuben. It's Polly Prince.
- Hey, Polly.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.248
How's it going?

28:29.333 --> 28:30.958
Good. I'm calling to say

28:31.085 --> 28:34.128
I'm free tomorrow night
if you want to get together.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.964
I'd love to get together.
That would be great.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.467
Should I pick a restaurant, or...

28:39.593 --> 28:41.010
No. You know what?

28:41.136 --> 28:44.639
I should probably check my schedule,
see if I can even do it.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.476
Okay. Did you say you were free?

28:48.602 --> 28:52.438
No, I'm actually not sure.
I'll talk to you later. Bye!

28:52.523 --> 28:53.940
Okay, hello?

28:55.150 --> 28:57.276
One, two, three, and...

28:57.361 --> 28:59.404
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

28:59.488 --> 29:01.531
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

29:01.657 --> 29:03.616
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

29:03.700 --> 29:05.743
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

29:05.828 --> 29:07.870
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

29:07.996 --> 29:10.039
What's the buzz?
Tell me what's a-happening

29:10.165 --> 29:12.792
Why should you want to know?

29:12.876 --> 29:15.169
Don't you mind about the future

29:16.839 --> 29:19.799
Don't you try to think ahead

29:21.051 --> 29:23.469
Save tomorrow for tomorrow

29:25.472 --> 29:27.348
Think about today instead

29:27.474 --> 29:29.016
- Sandy?
- What?

29:30.352 --> 29:32.854
I'm playing Jesus. That's my song.

29:33.230 --> 29:37.191
I know it's your song, but I felt
something and decided to go with it.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.776
But you're playing Judas.

29:38.861 --> 29:42.572
Judas. Look, here's the deal.
I'm the star of the show, okay?

29:42.698 --> 29:47.034
So if I decide to bust out a solo,
give me the freedom to rock out.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.870
From the top, Wonsuk.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.665
- So the play's going well?
- Yeah, I think it's gonna be fun.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.835
I just wish they wouldn't surround
me with a bunch of amateurs.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.796
Isn't that
the point of community theatre?

29:58.881 --> 30:00.047
Whatever.

30:00.174 --> 30:04.051
- So I'm going on a date with Polly.
- All right! Where you taking her?

30:04.178 --> 30:08.222
Some restaurant in the East Village.
She left the address on my machine.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.018
How could you let
Polly pick the restaurant?

30:13.103 --> 30:14.312
I had no choice.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.230
She called me seven times
to confirm

30:16.356 --> 30:18.149
and then cancel
and then confirm again.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.568
Why? What's wrong with letting her
pick the place?

30:20.694 --> 30:23.362
You've got
irritable bowel syndrome, dude.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.616
If she chose an ethnic restaurant,

30:26.742 --> 30:29.911
you'll be running to the bathroom
every five seconds.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.954
Oh, my God. You're right.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.248
Thank you.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.167
I doubt it will get this far

30:36.251 --> 30:39.045
but if she turns out
to be easier than I thought...

30:39.129 --> 30:41.005
there's something you need to know.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.424
- I'm not a virgin, Sandy.
- Not technically

30:43.550 --> 30:45.843
but times have changed
since you were last single.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.261
Now listen...

30:48.096 --> 30:50.890
when I'm making out with a girl
for the first time,

30:50.974 --> 30:53.267
I like to give her
a little spanking.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.061
- What?
- Nothing violent.

30:55.145 --> 30:58.022
Just tap her real light
on the tush and say,

30:58.106 --> 31:01.275
"Hey, I'm your daddy."

31:01.985 --> 31:03.486
Listen to me.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.531
- What are you doing?
- I'm blotting the grease.

31:06.615 --> 31:10.284
That's the best part. Don't be shy.
It's just a little tap.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.245
It's like saying,
"Boop, I'm your daddy."

31:12.329 --> 31:13.412
I'm not gonna tap her.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.122
Brings them right back to childhood.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.042
Trust me, they're putty
in your hands after that.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.962
I'm really excited about this.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.297
I feel like
this could be one of those...

31:23.382 --> 31:26.467
defining moments of my life,
or something, you know?

31:27.302 --> 31:31.138
I actually think it's not gonna
work out, but I'm pulling for you.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.850
Just pray to God
she doesn't go ethnic.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.145
- The place didn't sound ethnic.
- What was the name?

31:38.230 --> 31:39.397
Al Hafez.

31:43.485 --> 31:46.904
- So, when did you live in Morocco?
- In the late '90s.

31:46.989 --> 31:50.032
I bounced around to a bunch
of places over the past few years.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.993
- Like where?
- Oh, God, where?

31:52.077 --> 31:56.706
Let's see, Austin, Istanbul,
Sri Lanka, Portland,

31:56.832 --> 31:59.250
Costa Rica, Buffalo,
a couple other places.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.587
- Wow. Were you in the Peace Corps?
- No, I just like to move a lot.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.756
I get stir-crazy if I'm stuck
in one place too long, you know?

32:05.841 --> 32:07.258
Yeah, completely.

32:08.385 --> 32:09.885
Remember,
you were the person who...

32:09.970 --> 32:11.178
Oh, my God!

32:11.263 --> 32:13.681
I can't believe you remember that.

32:13.765 --> 32:17.435
Of course! You were the greatest
delegate in Model UN history.

32:17.519 --> 32:20.688
I guess I did manage
to pass a few resolutions.

32:22.065 --> 32:25.651
Are you okay? Because you're
sweating pretty profusely.

32:25.736 --> 32:29.030
No, I'm fine. I always react
this way to spicy food.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.740
But I love it.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.034
I can't believe you're not married.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.827
Even when we were kids,

32:34.911 --> 32:37.622
I saw you as the guy
who'd settle down at a young age.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.874
You were always kind of
like an old young guy.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.208
Well, it just hasn't happened.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.962
But what about you?
You ever gotten close?

32:45.047 --> 32:49.258
To the whole marriage thing?
Oh, God, no. No way, no. No.

32:50.385 --> 32:53.971
I'm not really big on the whole
long-term commitment thing.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.266
Why, are you coming
out of a bad relationship?

32:57.392 --> 32:59.769
No. I'm coming
out of eight bad relationships.

32:59.895 --> 33:00.936
Eight?

33:01.063 --> 33:04.398
- You sure I can't get you a towel?
- No, I'm good.

33:04.483 --> 33:08.402
But if the right person came along,
things might be different, right?

33:08.737 --> 33:11.739
Yeah. You're probably right.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.493
Sorry.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.539
- You mind if I go to the men's room?
- Please, sure.

33:20.624 --> 33:21.666
Oh, gosh!

33:24.461 --> 33:27.672
Occupied. I'm going to be here
all night, dude.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.719
- All right, well, this is me.
- Great.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.262
Why don't you come upstairs

33:35.347 --> 33:37.306
and I'll make you
some coffee or tea.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.557
Great.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.060
I just got to find my keys here.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.520
Oh, shoot.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.775
Right there, I hear them.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.530
Oh, yeah. Okay.

33:52.614 --> 33:53.489
- Wow! This is great, so cozy.
- Thanks.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.908
- Wow! This is great, so cozy.
- Thanks.

33:55.992 --> 33:59.620
- Did you just move in?
- No, I've been here four months.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.914
Rat! Rat in the house!

34:01.998 --> 34:06.043
Oh, no. This is Rodolfo.
He's a ferret.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.879
I got him in Sicily
at a flea market years ago.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.297
He's old.
He can't really see anymore.

34:12.134 --> 34:14.635
Cute. You mind
if I use your bathroom?

34:14.719 --> 34:15.761
Sure.

34:15.846 --> 34:18.889
That's not the bathroom.
My bathroom's right here.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.309
Okay. Yeah, because I just...

34:23.311 --> 34:26.230
had a lot to drink, a lot of water.
I'll just be a second.

34:26.313 --> 34:27.898
Okay, take your time.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.197
I don't believe this.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.998
Go away.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.735
Oh, no.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.942
God, I beg you, please,
if you make this water go down,

35:53.068 --> 35:56.403
I'll sit at your feet
and serve you for all of eternity.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.783
I'll adopt a Somalian kid
or I'll work in Calcutta

36:00.909 --> 36:04.328
or I'll just...
Please, make the water go down.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.510
Oh, my God!

36:22.013 --> 36:23.931
- This was fun.
- Yes.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.810
If I'd known your grandmother
embroidered that towel,

36:27.936 --> 36:30.521
- I would've never...
- Really, that's okay.

36:31.147 --> 36:35.109
- Okay, well, good night, Polly.
- Good night, Reuben.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.194
- Good night.
- Okay.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.530
- All right, okay.
- All right, that's nice.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.664
Why would you make
number two in her apartment?

36:48.790 --> 36:51.458
She asked me to come upstairs.
What should I have done?

36:51.543 --> 36:54.211
Tell her you're tired
and shag ass out of there.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.337
Guys.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.382
- What was that?
- I called her to apologize.

36:58.466 --> 37:02.177
It doesn't matter, because I doubt
she'll ever want to see me again.

37:02.304 --> 37:04.388
- I got to call you back.
- Cool.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.639
Mr. Van Lew?

37:06.850 --> 37:09.393
- Feffer?
- Yes. Hi, Reuben Feffer.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.437
I recognized you
from the Forbes cover.

37:11.521 --> 37:14.440
You're way early, sport.
Come on, then. Get in.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.817
- Is this the service elevator?
- Yeah.

37:17.319 --> 37:20.362
I don't think we'll have a problem
with this insurance business.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.574
Sure, I take chances, but you can't
build a successful business

37:23.658 --> 37:25.492
- without the occasional risk.
- Of course.

37:25.577 --> 37:29.079
What I'm trying to determine are the
kinds of risks you actually take.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.539
Only the calculated ones.

37:30.624 --> 37:32.708
Trust me, I plan on being around
for ages.

37:33.001 --> 37:36.337
I know we'd really love to give you
a policy if we can make it work.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.672
- We'll make it work, sport.
- Great.

37:39.341 --> 37:42.801
- So, what are we doing on the roof?
- I'm doing a bit of a BASE jump.

37:42.886 --> 37:46.013
Here, keep the walkie on channel 13,
all right?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.890
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.975
A free-fall
from an inanimate object.

37:50.060 --> 37:52.937
Always carry me chute in case
I find a good launching point.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.313
Oh, no.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.649
Look, just don't do anything,
all right?

37:56.733 --> 38:00.861
- Hey, Reuben, it's Polly Prince.
- Polly, how's it going?

38:00.946 --> 38:04.239
- I'll shout when I'm through, okay?
- No, that's not all right.

38:04.324 --> 38:05.407
Can I call you back?

38:05.492 --> 38:08.077
I just wanted to tell you
I got your message.

38:08.161 --> 38:11.246
Let's just start over
and forget about the loofah thing.

38:11.331 --> 38:12.665
Holy shit! No!

38:14.417 --> 38:15.459
Holy shit!

38:15.543 --> 38:17.169
I didn't even like that loofah.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.255
Relax. Leland's meeting
with the insurance guy right now.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.758
Whoa! Yeah!

38:27.180 --> 38:28.514
Oh, crap!

38:28.640 --> 38:31.225
- Oh, shit!
- I'll call you in the next few days.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.852
Leland to Feffer. You there, mate?

38:34.312 --> 38:36.397
Yes, Feffer to Leland, hello?

38:36.481 --> 38:37.982
Come on down and give us a hand.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.067
I think I fractured me coccyx.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.910
Look at that.
You got me a new loofah.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.203
It's from Finland

38:51.287 --> 38:54.206
and the salesman said
it has a very ergonomic design.

38:54.290 --> 38:58.252
Oh, Reuben, that's really...
Thank you, that's really sweet.

38:58.420 --> 38:59.878
Oh, my God!

39:00.422 --> 39:02.256
I don't believe this!

39:02.340 --> 39:04.133
What are you doing here?

39:04.217 --> 39:05.843
We're having an early supper.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.761
I wanted your father
to try new cuisines.

39:07.846 --> 39:08.929
It's only 3:00.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.889
It's a crime to beat
the dinner crowds?

39:10.974 --> 39:14.268
- Who is this young woman...
- This is Polly Prince.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.604
Polly, these are my parents,
Irving and Vivian Feffer.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.441
- It's so good meeting you.
- How are you?

39:20.525 --> 39:23.402
I can't believe you're
eating Indian. You hate spicy food.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.945
No, I don't.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.615
Well, I'm going to... Psst!
I'm going to ask...

39:28.825 --> 39:31.201
I'm going to ask
this nice Native American man

39:31.286 --> 39:32.411
to get us a bigger table.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.872
They're Indian.
You can call them Indian. It's okay.

39:34.956 --> 39:39.752
Hi. Need big table, please.
Four people. Many thanks.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.672
Okay.

39:44.591 --> 39:46.842
Now, how do you kids
know each other?

39:46.926 --> 39:50.846
We went to middle school together.
We were both in the Model UN.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.432
You still work in government, honey?

39:53.516 --> 39:56.185
No. I'm a waitress.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.521
She's also writing
a children's book.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.315
Oh, very nice.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.401
You'll never guess
who I ran into yesterday.

40:04.486 --> 40:06.111
- Who's that?
- Lisa's mother.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.279
Mmm-hmm. That's good.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.698
Dad, did you try this...
What's this called?

40:09.783 --> 40:11.742
- Saag.
- Saag. Did you try this?

40:11.826 --> 40:15.537
Apparently, Lisa's doing wonderfully
down there in St. Barts...

40:15.622 --> 40:17.122
selling villas, happy.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.624
That's good for her.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.293
- Now, who's Lisa?
- Not important.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.003
Lisa is Reuben's wife.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.924
She left him for another man
on their honeymoon.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.677
Are we ready for the check?
I think we'll take the check.

40:30.804 --> 40:31.970
What?

40:32.889 --> 40:37.017
- Well, your dad seems really nice.
- Yes, a man of few words.

40:37.894 --> 40:41.855
I just want you to know, I was going
to tell you about Lisa. I just...

40:41.940 --> 40:44.066
I was embarrassed and I...

40:44.317 --> 40:46.693
I guess because I hadn't seen you
for so long...

40:46.778 --> 40:48.779
It's so okay. I understand.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.990
I was an idiot. I should've told you
the truth from the start.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.992
Really, I'm not upset.

40:55.495 --> 40:58.372
- But when did this happen?
- Two weeks ago.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.208
Two weeks ago?

41:02.293 --> 41:05.003
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

41:07.340 --> 41:09.383
Well, it was a pretty big shock.

41:10.885 --> 41:14.930
I walked in on her, on Lisa with...

41:15.431 --> 41:18.934
a scuba instructor on the first day
of our honeymoon.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.564
They were still wearing
their flippers. Anyway...

41:29.320 --> 41:30.654
I mean...

41:36.161 --> 41:39.788
Hey, Reuben, it's Polly Prince.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.168
I don't know
if you have any plans tonight

41:44.252 --> 41:48.672
but if not, you should swing by
37 Gansevort Street around 9:00...

41:49.340 --> 41:51.884
if you can make it.
You know, it's no big deal.

41:51.968 --> 41:55.304
But it could be fun,
so, you know, think about it.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.348
Okay, so...

41:58.766 --> 42:00.267
I'll see you later.

42:00.435 --> 42:02.019
Or not. I mean, either way.

42:02.103 --> 42:05.606
Oh, if you do come,
you should wear comfortable shoes.

42:05.690 --> 42:08.483
That is, if you come,
which you totally don't have to.

42:08.568 --> 42:10.777
I mean, I might not even be there.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.494
I am so glad that you came.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.788
I wore comfortable shoes
like you said.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.540
So, what are we doing?

42:25.460 --> 42:26.835
Oh, crap.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.219
This place is a total secret.

42:35.303 --> 42:38.013
It's the best underground
salsa club in New York.

42:38.097 --> 42:42.017
- I'm not really a big dancer.
- It's easier than it looks.

42:43.770 --> 42:46.730
- There you go. Feel it in your legs.
- All right.

42:47.232 --> 42:48.315
Sorry.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.610
It's okay. Just step on my feet
a little less than that.

43:00.370 --> 43:01.828
Work it!

43:05.875 --> 43:09.378
- Looking good, Pollyanna.
- Hey, Javi.

43:10.588 --> 43:14.007
Oh, you should stop that.
This is my friend Reuben.

43:14.884 --> 43:16.009
This is Javi.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.720
Mind if I dance
with the beautiful lady?

43:19.514 --> 43:22.182
- I guess not.
- Thanks, man.

44:01.097 --> 44:03.390
- I think I might take off.
- Really?

44:03.933 --> 44:05.350
Are you having a bad time?

44:05.435 --> 44:08.270
No, I'm just not into
this whole dirty? Dancing thing.

44:08.396 --> 44:10.188
What do you mean, "dirty? Dancing"?

44:10.273 --> 44:13.567
I saw that movie. I know that's what
you and that Spaniard were doing.

44:13.651 --> 44:17.070
Whoa! Wait a minute.
First of all, he's Cuban.

44:17.488 --> 44:20.449
And that wasn't dirty? Dancing,
that was just salsa.

44:20.950 --> 44:23.869
Okay, I'm just really, truthfully
not the kind of guy

44:23.953 --> 44:26.121
that's ever gonna be
into these kind of clubs...

44:26.247 --> 44:28.081
Okay, Reuben, then...

44:28.458 --> 44:31.001
tell me, what kind of guy are you?

44:31.294 --> 44:33.462
What kind of guy am I?
What do you mean?

44:33.588 --> 44:37.049
Up until now, you haven't exactly
been the portrait of honesty.

44:37.133 --> 44:40.594
So just come clean, okay?
Just tell me who you are.

44:41.512 --> 44:43.555
- I hate spicy food.
- I knew it!

44:43.639 --> 44:46.516
I don't like it at all.
I have a mild case of IBS and...

44:46.601 --> 44:48.352
- What's that?
- Irritable bowel syndrome.

44:48.436 --> 44:50.687
- What?
- Irritable bowel syndrome.

44:50.772 --> 44:54.024
Oh, God. That's terrible. What else?

44:54.359 --> 44:56.526
The thing is,
I assess risk for a living.

44:56.611 --> 44:59.863
So I know I have a 0.013% chance
of being hit by a car

44:59.947 --> 45:02.491
on my way home,
or a 1 in 46,000 chance

45:02.617 --> 45:04.659
- of falling through a subway grate.
- Really?

45:04.786 --> 45:08.038
I manage that risk by
avoiding danger, having a plan

45:08.122 --> 45:09.498
and knowing my next move.

45:09.624 --> 45:12.459
And I guess
you don't live your life that way...

45:12.543 --> 45:14.127
No, I do it a little differently.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.130
Which is great, but I'm not
gonna ever be a dirty? Dancer

45:17.215 --> 45:18.840
and I don't eat food
with my hands

45:18.966 --> 45:20.133
and I really like you

45:20.218 --> 45:22.969
but I just don't think
this is gonna work out.

45:31.145 --> 45:33.063
- I just have to go pee.
- Okay.

45:48.704 --> 45:50.539
Just kidding!

45:52.333 --> 45:53.583
Oh! Funny.

46:23.072 --> 46:24.197
Hi.

46:43.050 --> 46:44.050
Ow!

46:45.219 --> 46:47.137
Did you just spank me?

46:48.139 --> 46:50.056
No! I don't...

46:51.225 --> 46:53.935
Are you sure? Because it felt
like you just swatted me.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.979
No, I have a little crick
in my wrist.

46:56.063 --> 46:58.148
You felt that, I was just...
Do you hear that?

46:58.232 --> 46:59.858
- Really?
- Yeah, you hear that?

46:59.942 --> 47:01.443
Well, I got it out.

47:11.996 --> 47:14.164
Oh, wow. This is incredible.

47:14.916 --> 47:16.249
Oh, man.

47:17.418 --> 47:19.794
Oh, God. Oh, yeah.

47:20.046 --> 47:23.215
Oh, no! No, you can't be done yet.

47:23.341 --> 47:24.883
Come on, Reuben, focus.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.344
You have to last
at least five minutes here.

47:27.428 --> 47:30.722
Four minutes, twenty-seven,
twenty-six, twenty-five.

47:31.349 --> 47:35.727
Two minutes, twenty, nineteen,
eighteen, seventeen.

47:36.187 --> 47:40.273
Come on, you can do it.
55, 54, 53, 52, 51, oh, God!

47:40.399 --> 47:41.608
Fifty!

47:45.863 --> 47:47.948
Fifty? Yeah!

47:49.075 --> 47:50.116
Whoo!

47:51.035 --> 47:52.369
Let it rain!

47:53.746 --> 47:56.039
I think I might end up marrying
this woman.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.166
Really? After one night?

47:58.376 --> 48:00.126
Did you spank her?

48:00.670 --> 48:02.879
Yeah, I tried,
but I don't think she liked it.

48:02.964 --> 48:05.173
Yeah, some women find it offensive.

48:06.133 --> 48:07.384
Iceman!

48:09.303 --> 48:11.930
I did not sleep with him
out of charity.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.099
You weren't interested
till you found out

48:14.183 --> 48:15.976
his wife boned a guy
on their honeymoon.

48:16.060 --> 48:20.188
That's not it.
He is a kind, decent, solid guy.

48:20.273 --> 48:22.482
I've never been
with anybody like that.

48:22.567 --> 48:25.151
Still sounds like a charity boning.

48:25.653 --> 48:28.488
Do you have to use
the word "bone" every time?

48:29.031 --> 48:31.408
I use it when it's appropriate.

48:32.410 --> 48:35.996
Ever heard of a guy shouting out
"fifty" when he orgasmed?

48:39.208 --> 48:42.419
Okay, so throw pillows
go in this cabinet here.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.424
You don't sleep on these?

48:47.800 --> 48:50.343
No, they're decorative.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.430
- For who?
- What do you mean?

48:53.556 --> 48:56.808
You're the only one who sees them,
but you don't sleep on them.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.060
You take them off the bed,
put them in a box,

48:59.145 --> 49:02.522
take them out, put them...
I just don't understand the point.

49:02.607 --> 49:05.400
I don't know.
Lisa thought they looked nice.

49:05.484 --> 49:06.693
Oh, I see.

49:18.789 --> 49:22.375
I don't see what the big deal is.
They make the bed look nice.

49:27.048 --> 49:28.757
What are you doing?
That's goose down.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.634
I'm liberating you.

49:31.302 --> 49:33.428
- Try it.
- No, I'm not going to...

49:33.554 --> 49:36.222
Just one stab.
Come on, see how you feel.

49:36.807 --> 49:38.683
- This is ridiculous.
- It's not ridiculous.

49:38.768 --> 49:41.227
It's not like driving a knife
into a pillow

49:41.312 --> 49:43.563
is suddenly going
to make me feel...

49:44.065 --> 49:46.149
Wow. That feels really good.

49:46.734 --> 49:47.942
Right?

49:49.153 --> 49:51.363
- What did I tell you?
- You're right.

49:51.447 --> 49:52.656
Come on, bigger one!

49:52.740 --> 49:55.408
- What's the point of these things?
- No point.

49:55.576 --> 49:56.743
Stupid.

49:58.579 --> 50:01.581
- Am I running a bed-and-breakfast?
- Not anymore.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.041
Know how many minutes I spend

50:03.125 --> 50:04.751
- getting them on and off?
- How many?

50:04.835 --> 50:07.087
Four in the morning, four at night.
Eight minutes.

50:07.171 --> 50:09.339
Fifty-six minutes a week,
two days a year,

50:09.423 --> 50:12.592
spent putting pillows
on and off a stupid bed!

50:13.761 --> 50:15.011
Whoa!

50:16.430 --> 50:18.139
Wait, you hit mattress.

50:18.224 --> 50:19.224
Oh!

50:20.476 --> 50:23.520
You know what? I really got to go.
I'm late. Shoot!

50:23.604 --> 50:25.146
What's wrong?
Lose your keys again?

50:25.272 --> 50:28.149
No, they're just not
where I left them before.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.318
Why don't you use that key-finder
I bought you?

50:30.444 --> 50:32.445
- I don't...
- I think it could help.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.698
Need the stupid key-finder!

50:34.782 --> 50:37.784
All right. Anyway, I was thinking
I'd come meet you.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.578
Really? I thought you hated
dirty? Dancing clubs.

50:42.039 --> 50:44.082
It's just salsa. It will be fun.
I'll watch.

50:44.166 --> 50:45.792
- What's that noise?
- Nothing.

50:45.876 --> 50:49.254
- It's the key-finder, isn't it?
- It's so not the key-finder.

50:49.338 --> 50:52.173
- Yes, it is!
- It's not. I'll see you later. Bye.

50:53.843 --> 50:54.968
How?

51:24.331 --> 51:27.500
- Reuby Tuesday, Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡s?
- Doing all right.

51:32.339 --> 51:36.551
You know what? Actually,
me no estÃ¡s too good, Javier.

51:37.595 --> 51:41.681
I want you to stay away from Polly.
Find yourself another dance partner.

51:42.349 --> 51:43.683
Why?

51:44.185 --> 51:47.061
Because she and I are a couple.
Yeah, we're dating.

51:47.188 --> 51:50.023
And I'm not going to let
some big-shot salsa king

51:50.107 --> 51:53.067
sweep in, with your mambo moves
and your Erik Estrada look

51:53.194 --> 51:56.905
and take her away. That's happened
before, and it won't again...

51:57.031 --> 51:59.824
- Reuben, I am gay.
- I don't care what you... What?

51:59.909 --> 52:01.534
I'm homosexual.

52:01.619 --> 52:04.704
My boyfriend, Hector, plays
the keyboards in the house band.

52:04.789 --> 52:05.789
Oh.

52:07.875 --> 52:10.585
You think maybe you could give me
some salsa lessons?

52:40.783 --> 52:44.160
- You hated it.
- No, I don't. It's just...

52:44.912 --> 52:47.747
It's very graphic
for a children's book.

52:48.082 --> 52:50.416
You know? Like this one...

52:51.585 --> 52:55.088
- "The boy with a nub for an arm."
- That one has a moral.

52:55.422 --> 52:59.259
To teach kids to be careful when
they're playing with fireworks.

52:59.385 --> 53:02.929
Right, and I think it's brilliant,
by the way, seriously.

53:04.473 --> 53:05.682
I mean, you really convey...

53:05.766 --> 53:09.435
the pain and the fear,
and I love the little doggy, too.

53:10.521 --> 53:12.939
But, and I don't mean this
in a bad way...

53:13.065 --> 53:14.107
Right.

53:15.234 --> 53:17.402
Just what were you thinking?

53:34.962 --> 53:37.964
I put all the risks and rewards
into the program,

53:38.048 --> 53:40.216
which helps me finalize my
recommendations...

53:40.301 --> 53:42.969
"Leland Van Lew. BASE jumping."

53:43.470 --> 53:47.473
That's supposed to be so much fun!
That should be on the rewards side.

53:47.641 --> 53:51.060
It's one of the most dangerous
activities a human being can do.

53:51.145 --> 53:52.228
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:52.313 --> 53:53.730
Have you done it?

53:53.814 --> 53:56.232
Have I parachuted
off the top of a building?

53:56.317 --> 53:57.483
No.

53:57.818 --> 54:00.320
So how do you know what it's like?

54:02.656 --> 54:03.948
I don't.

54:05.326 --> 54:06.826
Interesting.

54:07.912 --> 54:09.996
Would you like some more bulgogi?

54:10.122 --> 54:12.582
Sure, thanks. I actually like this.

54:12.666 --> 54:13.958
- You do?
- It's good.

54:17.504 --> 54:19.172
Now you look like
a pro racquetballer.

54:19.256 --> 54:21.466
- How's that shirt fit?
- It's fine.

54:21.550 --> 54:23.468
I thought maybe
we could just sit and talk.

54:23.552 --> 54:25.303
I'm not a big racquetball player...

54:25.387 --> 54:27.430
No worries.
We'll have a few giggles.

54:33.479 --> 54:35.480
I've been running the numbers.

54:37.483 --> 54:40.818
And I got to say, things don't look
good from our end.

54:40.903 --> 54:42.320
- Bollocks!
- Jesus!

54:45.699 --> 54:49.786
Please, Leland, I mean,
it's not just the BASE jumping.

54:49.870 --> 54:53.748
It's the heli-skiing,
volcano-luging, shark-diving.

54:54.917 --> 54:58.169
Bottom line is, unless you
drastically alter your lifestyle,

54:58.253 --> 55:02.340
- we won't be able to insure you.
- Reuben, I came to you for a reason.

55:02.883 --> 55:06.886
I was told you had more imagination
than other blokes in the big firms.

55:07.179 --> 55:09.931
That you analyze the man
and not just the numbers.

55:10.015 --> 55:11.641
I guess I was wrong.

55:12.977 --> 55:14.727
Are you trying to manipulate me?

55:14.812 --> 55:17.855
Of course I am.
But I want to hold on to me company.

55:23.237 --> 55:24.696
I'll tell you what.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.824
I'll be in Nantucket
at the end of the month.

55:27.908 --> 55:30.326
Come up and be my guest
aboard The 'Roo Shooter.

55:30.411 --> 55:32.120
- Aboard the what?
- My sailboat.

55:32.204 --> 55:34.831
I'll take you for a sail,
give you a chance to know me.

55:34.915 --> 55:38.334
By the end of the weekend,
you'll know what a safe bet I am.

55:38.419 --> 55:41.879
You know what?
You're bleeding pretty bad.

55:41.964 --> 55:44.007
I think I've swallowed a tooth.

55:46.719 --> 55:48.761
No. Got it.

55:50.222 --> 55:51.514
Your serve.

55:53.267 --> 55:55.101
So I tell Leland
we can't insure him.

55:55.185 --> 55:57.311
He responds by inviting me
to Nantucket

55:57.396 --> 55:59.147
for some
Death Race Sailing Challenge.

55:59.231 --> 56:02.692
Really? We got to go do that.
I've never been to Nantucket.

56:02.943 --> 56:06.112
- You want to come?
- Is that rude, to invite myself?

56:06.196 --> 56:09.824
Lt'd be great! Good, you'll actually
commit to something in advance.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.951
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

56:12.077 --> 56:16.247
Okay, yeah, I am.
I think that would be really fun.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.499
- What?
- What are you doing?

56:18.584 --> 56:21.044
I'm going to have some nuts.

56:21.128 --> 56:25.048
No. You don't eat mixed nuts
at a bar. Everybody knows that.

56:25.174 --> 56:27.133
What are you talking about?

56:27.217 --> 56:29.969
Okay, let's say, conservatively...

56:30.721 --> 56:33.765
17 people eat these nuts
on a given night. Okay?

56:33.849 --> 56:36.726
If they've been here for two weeks,
we're talking about...

56:36.810 --> 56:39.979
238 people who've dipped their
dirty? Hands into that bowl.

56:40.064 --> 56:41.981
Dirty? Why are their hands dirty??

56:42.066 --> 56:43.775
Only one out of six people

56:43.859 --> 56:45.693
wash hands
when they go to the bathroom.

56:45.778 --> 56:48.362
When you think you're innocently
eating a bar snack,

56:48.447 --> 56:50.573
you're ingesting
potentially deadly bacteria

56:50.657 --> 56:52.742
from 39 soil-handed strangers.

56:52.826 --> 56:55.036
People wonder why
they get E. Coli poisoning

56:55.120 --> 56:56.454
or salmonella or hepatitis.

56:56.538 --> 57:00.041
They should look at the snack bowl
at their local watering hole.

57:01.418 --> 57:04.879
I'm not being neurotic.
It's a hot zone in there.

57:09.510 --> 57:11.552
How could you have eaten those?

57:11.678 --> 57:14.263
I made such a compelling argument.

57:14.348 --> 57:16.682
I like to live life on the edge.

57:17.267 --> 57:19.852
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you never know.

57:32.199 --> 57:33.908
You don't have to do this.

57:34.034 --> 57:36.869
I don't care that you don't know
how to dance!

57:36.954 --> 57:39.539
I thought I'd give it one last try.
Hey, Javi.

57:39.623 --> 57:41.624
Hey, Reuben. You ready?

57:41.708 --> 57:42.834
Uh-huh.

57:42.918 --> 57:44.043
What's happening?

57:44.128 --> 57:45.920
- IFuerte!
- What?

57:48.715 --> 57:50.216
What are you doing?

59:11.048 --> 59:13.507
I don't know where that came from!

59:13.634 --> 59:15.301
It was just awesome.

59:16.303 --> 59:17.470
Holy shit.

59:25.145 --> 59:27.230
What are you doing here?

59:30.234 --> 59:31.567
I'm back.

59:34.196 --> 59:35.613
Who's this?

59:36.323 --> 59:38.783
- Who's this? This is my girlfriend.
- What?

59:38.867 --> 59:41.118
- You have a girlfriend?
- I'm not your girlfriend.

59:41.203 --> 59:44.497
I mean, we're just, kind of...
Hi, I'm Polly.

59:46.333 --> 59:48.167
- Lisa.
- Right.

59:55.968 --> 01:00:00.346
You guys probably have a lot
to talk about, so I'll just go.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.266
- I don't want you to go.
- Please, I want to go. Bye, Lisa.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.309
- Nice to meet you.
- I don't want you to go.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:07.478
You got to talk about it.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:09.855
I'm just going to go.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:17.780
I don't understand.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:20.658
I thought you were really happy
with Claude.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:24.704
I was, for a few weeks, but all he
talked about was scuba diving.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:27.164
- Really?
- I missed you, Reuben.

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:30.584
I missed you, too, but come on!
What was I supposed to do?

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.962
I moved on. I'm in a relationship.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.630
- What, with that Polly person?
- Yeah.

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.632
She doesn't call herself
your girlfriend.

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:39.468
That's... No, she just doesn't like
the phrasing.

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:42.138
Okay, then,
let me just ask you this.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:46.225
Are you really going to spend
the rest of your life with her?

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:48.311
I don't know, Lisa.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:51.355
Because I'm ready to do that
with you.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.233
I made a mistake,
and I took you for granted.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:58.404
But I promise you that I will
never, ever hurt you again.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.867
I love you, Reuben.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.417
You know what?

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:15.629
I think you should
go stay with your parents. Okay?

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:18.507
- I've to leave in a week.
- What? Where are you going?

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:21.802
I'm going into the house
I bought for us. Remember?

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:24.847
Let's do it together.
Let's go move into our house.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:28.476
We don't just...
No. We can't just go... I can't...

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.982
I don't even know
what to say right now, okay? So...

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.487
Okay.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:45.076
If you want to get back together
with her...

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.120
No, I wouldn't be seeing you
if I was planning...

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:51.415
It's cool. You guys are married.
She came back.

01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:54.377
How's it coming
with Herb Lazare, D.D. S?

01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:57.588
I haven't even gotten to it.
I'm still working on Van Lew.

01:01:57.672 --> 01:02:00.299
I thought you decided on Van Lew
two weeks ago.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.635
We present to AFLAC on Wednesday.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.179
- Can you hang on? Hang on.
- I have to go.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:08.057
- Better not be bonus-hunting on me.
Bonus-hunting?

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:11.560
That man's career's on the line.
I owe him a thorough analysis.

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:12.770
All right.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:15.523
I'm going to Barbados with
my mistress for the weekend.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:18.317
I want this Van Lew thing settled
by the time I get back.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.653
I am on it, and I'll make it happen.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.238
Good things.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.241
Damn!

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.077
- Hey, pal.
- Hey, Larry.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.162
Lisa dropped this off for you.

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:32.081
Oh!

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.041
Thanks.

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:49.932
I met Lisa Kramer, who showed me
an apartment, which I rented...

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:52.726
- just so she'd go out with me.
- I gave him a good price.

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:54.895
Not good enough. She's a killer.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:08.159
I just can't believe she came back.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:11.620
Can we just focus for a second?
I'm almost finished.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.748
- What's next?
- Polly's career prospects.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:17.877
Risky. She's writing a children's
book where kids get maimed.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:22.173
Her lack of career is a positive.
She'd have more time for the kids.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:26.385
You're skewing the numbers in
her favor. Why are we doing this?

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.387
Because I'm confused.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.014
My goddamn wife

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:32.766
shows up on my doorstep
wanting to get back together.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.727
Polly's freaking out.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:37.938
I just want to make sure
I'm making the right decision.

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:42.109
I don't see how putting these
two girls in the Riskmaster

01:03:42.194 --> 01:03:44.236
will help you make up your mind.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.784
- Interesting.
- What's it say?

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:52.495
Polly!

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:54.663
- Polly?
- Yeah.

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:57.958
No way. Just cut your losses
and get back with Lisa.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:01.212
I checked it three times.
It says she's the safer choice.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:02.630
Whatever.

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:07.551
By the way, is your health okay?
You're looking thin.

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:09.845
Polly's been making me
eat ethnic food,

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:12.348
so I've been throwing up
a lot lately.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:13.933
Cool.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.351
Polly Prince.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:18.812
Polly Feffer.

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:23.234
Polly Prince-Feffer.

01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:26.320
You can't cancel.
You were so excited to go.

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:27.696
I know, but...

01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:31.033
We fell in love
with these funny Bolivian mud huts.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.826
- Hold on.
- So we had our designer

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:35.079
use a similar color palette
in here.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:38.999
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm on the phone.
Would you just please keep it...

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:43.963
Also, I feel weird going away
for the weekend

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:47.466
- when your wife just came back.
- You're making this such a big deal.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:50.469
I told you, I'm not getting back
together with her.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.347
- So are you coming?
- I'm coming.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:55.432
- All right.
- Okay?

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:56.850
Bye.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:25.296
- You're good. You're a natural.
- This is amazing!

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:28.632
Hey, Leland, are those storm clouds
up ahead?

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:34.305
No, we might get a light dusting.
Nothing to write home about.

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:40.019
Are you sure you're all right?

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:43.063
I'm okay. I don't think I have
my sea legs yet.

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:45.316
- I'll be out in a sec.
- All right.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.234
Oh, God.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:56.327
I know we haven't been seeing each
other long, but I feel like...

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.787
it's time we take things
to the next level

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:02.291
and I'd like you
to consider moving in with me.

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:13.177
Why don't we just move in together?

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:24.021
Oh, yeah, we're going to have
ourselves a tussle.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:30.736
Rodolfo's in your toiletry kit.
Did you know that?

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:33.155
Did you pack him, or did you...

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.573
What is this?

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:38.077
Why am I in your computer
on your Riskmaster thingy?

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.162
Okay, you know what?
I can explain this.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.998
It's fascinating, actually.
I learned a lot about myself.

01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:46.960
I've learned that I have no career,
I'm flaky, I like ethnic food.

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:48.712
Would you let me explain?

01:06:48.797 --> 01:06:52.091
Lisa came back, and I've been trying
to figure things out.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:56.095
- What are you figuring out?
- Just about us, and our future.

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.682
Future? What are you talking about?
What future?

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:02.685
Reuben, come on.
This is a fling, you know?

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:05.229
What, did you think
we'd get married?

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:06.772
Whoa! Maybe.

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:09.692
I was gonna ask you
to move in with me first.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:13.320
You expect me to move to the
suburbs with you? Are you insane?

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.281
Why is that so crazy?
People do that all the time.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:20.202
They have kids, they make plans,
they get married, they buy houses.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.204
That's you, Reuben. You do that.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.790
That's what you do.
I don't live my life that way.

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:27.501
Is your lack of a plan
that different than my plan?

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:30.796
- I don't have a plan.
- You're on the non-plan plan.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.007
- I am not on a non-plan plan.
- You are, too.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.593
I've never met anybody
more afraid of commitment.

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:39.930
You were a senior delegate
at the Model UN, Polly.

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.765
What the hell happened to you?

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:49.356
Come on, you mother!
You can do better than that!

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.442
I've been living my life, okay?

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:54.403
I've been in good relationships
and in shitty ones.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:58.031
And I've moved a lot
and I've been happy and sad

01:07:58.116 --> 01:08:00.159
and lonely and that's what
I've been doing.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:02.453
Which is more than I can say
for some freak

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:05.873
who thinks he'll get Ebola virus
from a bowl of mixed nuts.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:08.584
Those nuts have pee on them!
It's common sense.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:11.837
Trust me, that is so far
beyond common sense.

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:16.550
You don't understand
what I grew up with.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:18.301
My mother made me
afraid of everything.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:21.721
Big deal, Reuben.
My dad had a whole second family.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:24.057
- What?
- Yeah, on Long Island.

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:27.310
A wife and kids
and a golden retriever.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.188
A second family?

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:32.483
Whatever. Hey, you know what?

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:36.569
I'm glad I saw that. I am.

01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:40.783
Because I'm going to make this
really easy for you, Reuben.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.743
I have no interest...

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:47.331
in getting married
and moving to the suburbs.

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:50.000
And obviously that's
really important to you.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:52.544
So here's what I think
your new plan should be.

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:56.131
You should get back together
with Lisa, move into your house

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:57.841
and move on with your life.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:01.220
And I think you guys
will be really happy together.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:03.013
Oh, dear Lord.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.939
You're not making my job
any easier, Leland.

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:15.526
Come on, Reub.
Weather report said sunny skies.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.393
Hey, it's Polly Prince.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.979
Leave me a message,
or call back, or not.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:55.065
You know, whatever. Okay, bye.

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:57.609
Hey, Polly, it's me. Listen...

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:01.697
I'd like to talk to you, because I
feel bad about what happened.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:04.074
Give me a call on my cell phone.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.632
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Lisa.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:25.178
So, how's the house?

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.848
The house is great.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.059
It's big, but, you know, great.

01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:34.730
I can't wait to see it.
Did you get the gift I sent you?

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:36.523
Yeah, I did. Thanks.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.192
I really want to see you.

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:42.321
I don't know, Lisa.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.114
Let me think about it.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.786
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:53.040
The premiere ofJesus Christ
Superstar is about to begin.

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:55.417
Hey, Reuby Tuesday!

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:58.211
- Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡s?
- What are you doing here?

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:01.214
What else? Hector's playing
keyboards in the band.

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:03.342
I didn't figure you a fan
of musical theatre.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.094
My friend Sandy Lyle is in the show.

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:08.931
Have you talked to Polly?

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:13.185
She was upset, bro.
It must've been some kind of fight.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:16.146
Yeah, I keep calling her
and she won't pick up the phone.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:19.733
I don't know, I was thinking about
maybe dropping by tomorrow.

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:23.320
It's a bit too late, papi.
She's leaving town in two hours.

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:24.947
What?

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:26.990
Why? Where is she going?

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:29.618
I don't know. She said goodbye.
That's it.

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:33.080
- Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.
- No, yeah. Hi.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:39.086
Hey, Javi, this is Lisa, my wife.

01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:02.025
Her mother told me she was back.
You're doing the right thing here.

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:05.696
- Relax. I'm not promising anything.
- It's very exciting.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.912
Reuben, Stan. Change of plan.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:17.416
The meeting with Van Lew's board
and AFLAC has moved to 4:00.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.167
4:00? I don't know if I can do that.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.878
What's wrong with you?
Get your ass over here!

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:24.506
Good evening, folks.
I'm Sandy Lyle

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.092
and I've got
a very special announcement.

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:29.302
Please note
that in tonight's performance,

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:33.348
in addition to playing Judas,
I'll be playing Jesus as well.

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:35.684
Thank you and enjoy the show.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:38.228
Sandy, what are you doing?
Wonsuk is playing Jesus.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:41.023
It's cool. I'll play dual roles.
Give me the crown, Wonsuk.

01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:43.150
Screwyou, Sandy,
you're a has-been.

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:45.610
No one even cares
you were in that stupid movie.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.279
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit!

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:51.742
Judas is biting me!

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:55.787
What happened in there?

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:59.958
I'm a professional and I won't put
my reputation on the line

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:02.085
for a group of freaking amateurs.

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:05.380
It's always the same story
with you, pal.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.552
You did this one movie
a hundred years ago.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:14.473
From then on, you thought you were
better than everybody else.

01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:17.601
Why don't you let go,
move on with your life?

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:20.729
It's not about
what happened in the past

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.939
or what you think
might happen in the future.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:25.525
It's about the ride,
for Christ's sake.

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.237
There's no point in going through
all this crap

01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:31.239
if you don't enjoy the ride.

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:32.699
And you know what?

01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:36.286
When you least expect it,
something great might come along.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.955
Something better than
you even planned for.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:45.045
You were funny as hell
playing those bagpipes, though.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:47.714
Did I ever tell you that?

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:51.927
I don't think I've ever heard you
speak before, Mr. Feffer.

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:02.312
So, Reuby, are we going to grab
a bite after your work thingamajigy?

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.731
No, Lisa...

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:08.485
I shouldn't have asked you
to come down here.

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:11.113
I'm not getting back together
with you.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:13.824
What are you talking about?

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.534
- Why?
- "Why?"

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:20.872
You screwed a scuba-diving
instructor on our honeymoon.

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:26.002
What kind of cold, heartless bitch
would do that to someone they love?

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.924
I'd have to be an idiot to get back
together with you after that.

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:35.220
And by the way, I destroyed
all your little throw pillows.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:38.890
Yeah, because throw pillows suck.
They serve no purpose.

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.767
They're purely decorative.

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:47.107
Dude, that was incredible!

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:50.026
You told me I should get back
together with her.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.113
Whatever you do, don't ever take
my advice again.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.407
Your dad totally put it
in perspective for me.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:59.411
I was barely famous back then,
and I'll never be famous again.

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:02.205
What about your
E! True Hollywood Story?

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:05.584
The E! Channel doesn't even know
we're making this show.

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:07.294
What do you mean?

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.671
I hired Dustin and Vic myself.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:13.842
I was going to try and sell it
to the network when I'm done.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.763
You're doing an
E! True Hollywood Story on yourself?

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:23.101
Sandy, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.270
I know. I'm such a loser.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:34.446
I need you to do something for me
that's really important

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.907
so promise me, this one time
you won't screw it up.

01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:39.075
Reuben, I'm your wingman.

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:41.786
Whatever it is,
I will not let you down.

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:44.664
You're Reuben's proxy?
What the hell does that mean?

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.875
He's dealing with
a personal situation,

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:50.712
so he asked me to fill in.
Relax, I'm a professional actor.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:52.505
They will never know the difference.

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:56.509
- I can't freaking believe this.
- Quiet. I'm trying to prepare.

01:16:01.349 --> 01:16:02.515
I'm going to vomit.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.695
I am so sorry
for the delay, folks...

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.199
but one of our senior analysts,
Reuben Feffer,

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:22.994
had his spleen burst
just a few moments ago and...

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:25.664
- That's not good. Will he be okay?
- God willing.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:28.875
Be that as it may, we have
Mr. Feffer's associate here...

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.045
Mr. Sanford Lyle,
who's been briefed on the case

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:34.673
and will present
Reuben's recommendations.

01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:36.591
Thank you, Stanley.

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:47.519
I just need a little water.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.993
As you know, this is a highly
complex case.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:06.871
Let me see here.

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:15.672
On the plus side, Leland's
blood pressure is pretty solid.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:19.175
And he's at a decent weight.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.095
And he looks
pretty damn healthy, right?

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.389
I mean, he's a sexy guy.

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:25.724
Right?

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:29.519
And he is sexually active
in the community.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:46.244
Polly!

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.121
JFK, please.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:21.780
Let's not bullcrap each other.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:25.533
On paper, Van Lew is one of
the riskiest sons of bitches alive.

01:18:25.785 --> 01:18:28.870
But, people,
we cannot sum up a man's life

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:32.123
with a bunch of numbers
on a computer screen.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.585
We all need to look
into our hearts and go,

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:39.631
"Do I think this dude is going
to die in a few years or not?"

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:45.011
Is Leland here going to fight off
a man with the last name Reaper...

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:48.973
first name...
Who goes by the last name Reaper...

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.975
first name Grim?

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:53.520
Or will this BASE-jumping...

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.233
crocodile-wrestling...

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.235
shark-diving...

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:03.071
volcano-luging...

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.324
bear-fighting, snake-wrangling...

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:09.619
motocross-racing bastard die?

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:11.996
And the answer...

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:14.499
is no, friends.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.001
Which is why myself...

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.922
Reuben Feffer, Stan...

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:25.385
and all of us here
at Indurby & Friends,

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.887
are willing to lay our asses
on the line

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.765
and proudly recommend
that Leland Van Lew

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.226
receive $50 million,

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:36.396
in life and health
and automobile insurance,

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:40.483
for a duration
of no less than 20 years.

01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:46.364
What do you think, guys?

01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:51.578
Are you that kid
from Crocodile Tears?

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:57.584
- You're goddamn right I am.
- I thought so.

01:19:57.918 --> 01:20:00.295
Impressive presentation.
He's insured.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:03.506
- Congratulations.
- Bloody ripper!

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:05.508
Love you, son!

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:17.812
Rodolfo, wait!

01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:20.398
I'm so sorry!

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:30.074
Reuben, it's too late. I have to be
on a plane in 45 minutes.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.118
I don't think
you really want to leave here.

01:20:32.203 --> 01:20:34.454
You have no idea what I want.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.999
You left Rodolfo behind.
Does that mean anything?

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:43.087
I made a mistake. I should've
never put you in the Riskmaster.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:45.590
Truth is, no matter what happened
on our honeymoon,

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:48.218
- you're much riskier than Lisa.
- Yes! Right!

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.470
That's why it won't work out
between us.

01:20:50.554 --> 01:20:53.640
Reuben, you're a nice,
safe, conventional guy.

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:55.892
It's not going to work out.

01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:57.769
I don't think
that's who I really am.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:00.396
It is. That's okay.

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:03.274
What do I have to do
to prove it to you?

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.654
What are you... Oh, my God.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.241
Hey, look! Look, I'm eating nuts.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:15.328
- What are you doing?
- Those nuts aren't even dirty?

01:21:22.962 --> 01:21:26.047
Since we've been together,
I've felt more uncomfortable,

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:29.676
out of place, embarrassed
and just physically sick

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.261
than in my entire life.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:33.304
But I couldn't have
gone through all that...

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:36.432
I couldn't have thrown up
19 times in 48 days...

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:40.144
if I wasn't in love with you.

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:46.067
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is just a fling.

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:49.195
But if you get on that plane
and go to Cincinnati or Tanzania

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.532
or wherever, we'll never know
if it could've been more.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.494
Oh, no.

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.342
Please don't eat those.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:14.345
No, really.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.064
I don't want you to go away.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:29.986
- I'm not going to marry you.
- I don't want to get married.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:33.239
I just want to take you to dinner.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.325
Sometime this week.

01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:42.707
Can I pick the place?

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.057
Solid!

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:03.394
Excuse me. Hi. Hello.

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:07.398
I see you two are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet...

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.567
Oh, my stars and stripe, Reuben!

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:12.111
Oh, my God,
I cannot believe it is you.

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:14.530
- This is Polly.
- Hi, Polly. I am Claude.

01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:16.240
Wow, hi.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.909
So, how's it going?

01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:21.954
In truth, it has been a little bit
tough noogies for me.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:25.166
Lisa, she broke my heart.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:28.378
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- That is life.

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:31.714
Well, you have to be like the hippo.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.008
Exactly. Like the hippo.

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:38.054
So, let me guess.
You are here on honeymoon again?

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:41.849
- This is your beautiful bride?
- No, we're just hanging out.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:45.353
- It's more serious than that.
- I'm just saying we're not married.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.772
Right. Definitely not married.
But it's possible.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:48.940
It is possible.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:52.402
We're taking things step by step,
seeing how they work out.

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:55.613
I don't really understand
what you're talking about...

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:57.949
but any chance
you're for scuba today?

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:00.118
You know what,
actually we are for scuba.

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:02.620
- No way, JosÃ©!
- Yes way, JosÃ©!

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:05.289
But, we're going out with that guy.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:09.168
We'll be out there in a minute!

01:24:10.129 --> 01:24:13.297
You know what? As long as
you're for scuba, I am happy.

01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:15.466
Oh, that's sweet.

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.510
So, au revoir, my good friend.

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:22.014
Thank you for everything, Claude.

01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:25.143
It's good to see you again.
Good-bye, Polly.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:28.104
- Nice to meet you, Claude.
- You, as well.

01:24:30.441 --> 01:24:32.817
- So you're ready?
- Let's do it!
