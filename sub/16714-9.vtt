WEBVTT

00:02.017 --> 00:03.773
Previously
on "Criminal Minds"...

00:03.875 --> 00:07.750
I was able to increase
the budget to hire a new agent.

00:07.789 --> 00:09.109
That's great.

00:09.135 --> 00:10.406
Well, I made an offer.

00:10.562 --> 00:12.179
I'm expecting a response
tomorrow

00:12.226 --> 00:14.039
and my fingers are crossed
it'll be a yes.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.382
But I can tell you this agent's been
with the bureau nearly 20 years,

00:17.414 --> 00:19.770
And we met on a case
for Interpol.

00:19.912 --> 00:21.011
Steven?

00:21.047 --> 00:22.513
You gotta be kidding.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.149
Steven Walker. How you been?

00:25.174 --> 00:27.466
Welcome aboard.

00:28.739 --> 00:30.458
Really appreciate
you helping out

00:30.544 --> 00:31.829
On these seminars, Steven.

00:31.857 --> 00:34.755
Of course. Agent Rossi's
profiling class

00:34.856 --> 00:37.325
is what got me hooked my
rookie year in the bureau.

00:37.419 --> 00:39.036
You got in your first year.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.380
I never even heard of that.

00:40.442 --> 00:41.899
I had to wait until my third.

00:41.934 --> 00:43.270
I test well.

00:43.419 --> 00:45.106
Ok, you don't have to be modest.

00:45.192 --> 00:49.075
Do you know what I had to do
to pry you away from the B.A.P.?

00:49.286 --> 00:50.339
We're lucky to have you.

00:50.372 --> 00:51.575
Well, I appreciate it.

00:51.653 --> 00:53.950
Agent Rossi was a mentor
when I was coming up,

00:53.997 --> 00:55.755
So I'm happy to be here.

00:55.872 --> 00:58.369
He said you were one of the
most naturally gifted profilers

00:58.437 --> 01:00.057
he's ever seen.

01:00.822 --> 01:02.549
By the way, you know
what today is, right?

01:02.697 --> 01:04.885
Yes. I wasn't gonna
say anything.

01:04.971 --> 01:06.457
Good plan.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.886 --> 01:20.420
I'll meet you up there.
Give me a minute.

01:47.776 --> 01:50.331
Please...

01:58.281 --> 02:01.343
You ever seen brain matter and
blood splattered together?

02:01.982 --> 02:04.349
It makes a pink mist.

02:13.237 --> 02:14.925
Don't worry.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.525
You won't even feel it.

02:16.550 --> 02:18.448
Michael Lee Hill, FBI!

02:18.473 --> 02:19.425
Drop your weapon!

02:19.487 --> 02:20.386
I'll kill her now.

02:20.425 --> 02:21.536
Let her go, Michael.

02:21.571 --> 02:23.338
- We can't do that.
- Give me back up.

02:23.448 --> 02:25.175
Then she dies today.

02:25.265 --> 02:27.222
You hear me?!

02:28.347 --> 02:29.534
No!

02:29.870 --> 02:30.917
Congratulations.

02:30.995 --> 02:34.308
You just sent agent prentiss
to the emergency room.

02:34.348 --> 02:37.050
Hopefully, she pulls through.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.628
You only take the shot

02:38.722 --> 02:40.847
If you are absolutely sure.

02:40.901 --> 02:41.886
And trust me,

02:41.924 --> 02:44.518
You are rarely absolutely sure.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.292
With the adrenaline, even the
best can miss easy shots

02:47.354 --> 02:48.162
From time to time.

02:48.198 --> 02:50.018
And a hail of bullets
is never a good thing.

02:50.089 --> 02:52.240
The point... is to control
the situation,

02:52.268 --> 02:56.362
and a shootout is one of the most
uncontrollable situations there are.

02:56.589 --> 02:57.605
Anyone else?

02:57.698 --> 03:00.581
Maybe speak to his mother
issues, get him off balance.

03:00.808 --> 03:03.800
I'll blow her head off.

03:05.940 --> 03:07.370
No, you won't.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.909
Your mother would be angry
if you did.

03:08.933 --> 03:10.815
You think she abandoned
you, but she didn't.

03:10.878 --> 03:11.998
You don't know a damn thing.

03:12.034 --> 03:13.191
We know your mother loves you.

03:13.215 --> 03:15.526
Just let that girl go
and see for yourself.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.433
We could take you
to her right now.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.628
Liars!

03:31.143 --> 03:33.667
Wrong answer. You just
got the victim killed

03:33.729 --> 03:35.425
and lost the unsub.

03:35.956 --> 03:37.375
Not exactly a win.

03:37.511 --> 03:40.667
You're all regional coordinators
with a few years on the job,

03:40.722 --> 03:43.011
and this is an advanced
training seminar.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.786
You gotta do better than that.

03:44.811 --> 03:45.815
So what else?

03:45.860 --> 03:48.683
Well, the profile says
he's narcissistic.

03:48.768 --> 03:50.206
I mean, you should
appeal to that.

03:50.239 --> 03:52.636
Finally somebody's thinking.
Now I remember,

03:52.713 --> 03:55.596
why I recommended you for
this program, agent Clark.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.073
I'll blow her head off.

03:57.129 --> 03:58.667
You don't need her, Michael.

03:58.823 --> 04:00.784
You're already a household name.

04:01.026 --> 04:04.511
It's true. I've hunted men
like you all over the world.

04:04.537 --> 04:05.818
You're the best we've ever seen.

04:05.842 --> 04:08.808
Now, just let that girl go
so you can tell your story.

04:09.104 --> 04:12.206
No! No!

04:32.071 --> 04:33.766
The takedown, as we call it,

04:33.852 --> 04:36.102
is an extremely fluid situation,

04:36.188 --> 04:38.875
You need to rely on your
instincts, your training

04:38.938 --> 04:41.102
and above all else, the profile.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.031
It could save your life,
not to mention your partner's

04:44.110 --> 04:45.346
and the victim's.

04:45.381 --> 04:48.961
That's why we work so hard
to build it.

04:50.414 --> 04:54.563
All right, that's all for today.

04:55.180 --> 04:56.477
Let's do it.

04:57.055 --> 04:59.563
Uh, excuse me, agent Rossi.

04:59.813 --> 05:01.391
Uh, we heard it's your birthday

05:01.523 --> 05:03.305
and in your book
you said you like scotch.

05:03.391 --> 05:06.495
So we all got together
and put in and...

05:07.453 --> 05:08.758
We got you this.

05:08.844 --> 05:11.719
Now, we know alcohol's
not allowed on the premises,

05:11.797 --> 05:12.805
but we figured...

05:12.899 --> 05:15.594
I don't celebrate
my birthday, but thank you.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.547
Ok?

05:18.123 --> 05:19.906
Well... I'm sorry.

05:19.938 --> 05:20.771
I say something wrong?

05:20.796 --> 05:22.031
It's not you.

05:22.969 --> 05:25.172
Have any of you
heard of Tommy Yates?

05:25.289 --> 05:26.687
The Womb Raider?

05:26.781 --> 05:28.281
Yeah, agent Rossi put him away.

05:28.313 --> 05:30.344
He's one of the most
prolific serial killers ever.

05:30.406 --> 05:32.008
He's also one of
the escaped convicts

05:32.110 --> 05:33.891
from that mass
Prison Break last year.

05:33.992 --> 05:35.781
He had something like
40 victims, right?

05:35.852 --> 05:39.649
47 that were recovered, but he
claims to have killed over 100.

05:39.719 --> 05:42.492
He kidnapped his female
victims, starved them for days

05:42.555 --> 05:45.461
and then cut out their reproductive
organs, hence the nickname.

05:45.586 --> 05:47.250
I heard he took out
their vocal chords, too.

05:47.274 --> 05:49.750
He did, indeed.
But a few years back,

05:49.821 --> 05:51.969
after he was caught,

05:52.125 --> 05:53.649
he and Rossi made a deal.

05:53.758 --> 05:55.117
Every year Yates agreed

05:55.172 --> 05:57.188
to give him another name
and location

05:57.250 --> 05:58.367
of a victim he buried.

05:58.469 --> 06:00.391
But only one name a year

06:00.508 --> 06:02.750
and only on Rossi's birthday.

06:03.336 --> 06:06.125
In exchange, Yates got
transferred to the east coast,

06:06.235 --> 06:08.531
where his death sentence
got commuted to life

06:08.649 --> 06:10.453
Without the possibility
of parole.

06:10.539 --> 06:14.000
Today is Rossi's first
birthday since Yates escaped.

06:29.212 --> 06:30.745
This is Rossi.

06:47.360 --> 06:51.063
Sorry, we couldn't have
our annual sit-down.

06:51.610 --> 06:52.867
There's still time.

06:52.992 --> 06:54.475
Just tell me where you are.

06:54.578 --> 06:55.843
Nice try.

06:56.188 --> 06:59.213
But... considering everything
you've done for me,

06:59.367 --> 07:01.797
I figured I still owe you
a present.

07:02.633 --> 07:04.703
Her name is Jody Wilson.

07:05.180 --> 07:07.121
Is Jody Wilson?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.690
What do you mean, is?

07:10.664 --> 07:11.696
Answer me.

07:11.797 --> 07:13.438
I'm back, Dave.

07:13.813 --> 07:16.530
And I'm feeling like
my old self again.

07:17.031 --> 07:18.649
Now, listen close

07:18.797 --> 07:21.235
and I'll tell you where
you're gonna find her.

07:27.359 --> 07:32.464

08:01.142 --> 08:04.171
"what madness is it
to be expecting evil

08:04.196 --> 08:05.314
before it comes?"

08:05.368 --> 08:08.435
Lucius Annaeus Seneca.

08:09.408 --> 08:10.712
Well, we have to wait
for the coroner,

08:10.736 --> 08:13.204
but... clearly her genitalia
and reproductive organs

08:13.244 --> 08:14.119
have been mutilated.

08:14.165 --> 08:15.447
Her vocal chords, too.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.681
She looks to be about
late 40s, early 50s.

08:17.736 --> 08:20.376
That tracks. I mean, all of his
victims are right around his age.

08:20.462 --> 08:21.751
And he buried her, too.

08:21.829 --> 08:23.165
So if he sticks to his pattern,

08:23.222 --> 08:24.892
he'll most go after
another woman soon.

08:24.947 --> 08:26.673
He usually kills in twos, right?

08:26.752 --> 08:28.819
So nothing's changed.
His M.O.'s exactly the same.

08:28.954 --> 08:30.861
Well, not exactly.
His first victim

08:30.954 --> 08:33.509
is usually high-risk...
runaways, prostitutes.

08:33.572 --> 08:35.806
But Jody Wilson
is as low-risk as they come.

08:35.892 --> 08:37.063
That's new.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.328
Assuming that this is
his first victim...

08:39.453 --> 08:42.345
It is. He would have
told me otherwise.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.244
Alvez, coordinate with
the fugitive recovery team.

08:45.299 --> 08:46.939
I want a full-scale manhunt.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.931
I'll contact the press
to warn the public.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.531
There's something else
that's new, you know.

09:02.499 --> 09:03.854
Yeah.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.281
Now he's taunting me.

09:06.570 --> 09:09.132
How... how is that new?
I mean, one name,

09:09.257 --> 09:10.437
a year on your birthday.

09:10.554 --> 09:11.781
Wasn't the whole deal a taunt?

09:11.835 --> 09:13.835
No. That was about
power and control.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.788
This is about payback.

09:15.859 --> 09:16.913
How can you be sure?

09:16.974 --> 09:19.734
I've been tracking
that guy since '92.

09:19.788 --> 09:21.476
He was aware of me then,
but not once

09:21.538 --> 09:24.062
did he reach out...
before one of his kills.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.866
As a matter of fact, whenever
we got close, he went under.

09:26.944 --> 09:28.632
So why start taunting you now?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.171
That's the million-dollar
question.

09:30.262 --> 09:34.366
But it definitely has to do
with rapport and mutual respect

09:34.491 --> 09:35.491
built up over the years.

09:35.538 --> 09:37.087
Um, Mutual respect?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.702
You respect that monster?

09:38.749 --> 09:41.241
I used to think that
they were all monsters, too.

09:41.523 --> 09:42.812
But they're not.

09:43.148 --> 09:44.452
They're just men,

09:44.554 --> 09:46.398
and occasionally women.

09:46.804 --> 09:48.523
And not to respect
the people I hunt

09:48.562 --> 09:50.999
would be like a soldier
not respecting his enemy.

09:51.140 --> 09:54.015
And that mistake costs lives.

09:54.108 --> 09:56.327
But how do you know he felt
the same way about you?

09:56.437 --> 09:58.538
This whole thing feels
like disrespect.

09:58.593 --> 09:59.910
Because he said as much.

09:59.945 --> 10:02.632
Truth be told, I actually
think he liked me.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.109
Yates has no family
and no friends.

10:05.288 --> 10:08.616
Agent Rossi is the only real human
connection he has to the world.

10:08.781 --> 10:10.515
And I took advantage of that.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.781
I wanted that rapport with him.

10:12.843 --> 10:16.913
Sorry. Sir, I know, I'm
late, but I come bearing

10:17.171 --> 10:19.421
Um, gifts,

10:19.562 --> 10:20.741
In the form of case files.

10:20.796 --> 10:24.202
I have also sent you all
digital copies,

10:24.327 --> 10:27.773
If you are of
the millennial variety.

10:27.913 --> 10:30.312
And since you're all here
in official capacity

10:30.413 --> 10:33.007
and since this seminar is
considered on-the-job training,

10:33.060 --> 10:36.288
We're enlisting every one
of you to help catch this guy.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.820
So make sure you familiarize
yourselves with all of this,

10:38.884 --> 10:42.070
and our technical analyst Penelope
Garcia will help you in any way she can.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.859
In the meantime, I want
to ask about next steps.

10:44.926 --> 10:45.958
What are they?

10:46.071 --> 10:47.343
I'd put a trace on the phone.

10:47.374 --> 10:50.287
Way ahead of you. He's probably
using prepaid cell phones,

10:50.312 --> 10:52.796
Which means we have to keep
him on the line long enough

10:52.831 --> 10:55.382
to triangulate the signal.
What else?

10:55.421 --> 10:58.156
I'd like to see the official m.E.
Report on Jody Wilson.

10:58.210 --> 11:01.705
I'd also like to know what the crime scene
techs found out at the disposal site.

11:01.757 --> 11:03.406
We're waiting
on those reports. Go on.

11:03.442 --> 11:06.923
Victimology on Jody Wilson. Phone
records, email, social media.

11:07.009 --> 11:09.179
There's nothing.
Jody was merely analog.

11:09.214 --> 11:10.861
I'd talk to her family
and friends,

11:10.892 --> 11:12.454
get to really know
who Jody Wilson was.

11:12.495 --> 11:14.689
Very good. Her mother Mae
will be here in an hour.

11:14.783 --> 11:18.392
In the meantime, get to work.

11:46.785 --> 11:47.795
What are you two doing here?

11:47.819 --> 11:48.785
We thought we would help

11:48.820 --> 11:50.667
With the Mae Wilson interview.

11:51.206 --> 11:52.488
Prentiss send you?

11:52.784 --> 11:55.401
I think she was just trying
to utilize our skill sets.

11:55.573 --> 11:57.370
Thanks. But I got it.

11:57.597 --> 12:01.965
And... She's a little
worried about you.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.308
We all are.

12:03.495 --> 12:06.206
We know what this case
means to you.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.604
I'm fine.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.276
I don't need help.

12:09.448 --> 12:11.058
I've personally spoken
to the parents

12:11.112 --> 12:13.167
of every single one
of Tommy Yates' victims,

12:13.245 --> 12:15.870
and I'm not about
to change that now.

12:22.136 --> 12:23.330
Mrs. Wilson?

12:23.526 --> 12:24.988
Uh-huh.

12:25.237 --> 12:27.206
I'm SAA Rossi,

12:27.323 --> 12:29.323
but you can call me David.

12:29.534 --> 12:31.018
I want to thank you
for coming in.

12:31.128 --> 12:32.683
Is there anything
I could get you...

12:32.761 --> 12:33.997
Water, coffee?

12:34.175 --> 12:36.066
No. No. Thank you.

12:39.222 --> 12:41.386
Let me just say,

12:41.784 --> 12:45.050
I want to tell you
how sorry I am for your loss.

12:45.167 --> 12:46.706
And if there's anything
that we can do,

12:46.761 --> 12:48.628
Please don't hesitate to ask.

12:48.737 --> 12:49.948
Thank you.

12:50.011 --> 12:52.585
Now, are you ready
to answer a few questions?

12:52.725 --> 12:56.452
Ok. So when was the last
time you saw Jody?

12:56.593 --> 13:00.241
Would you say that you two
had a close relationship?

13:00.593 --> 13:02.296
Was Jody a drinker

13:02.569 --> 13:05.233
Or maybe do any drugs
that you know of?

13:05.538 --> 13:09.538
Is there anyone you know
who would want to hurt Jody?

13:09.632 --> 13:12.869
No. Jody has always
been sweet.

13:12.936 --> 13:14.871
Had her mood changed recently?

13:14.906 --> 13:18.208
Yes, she was happy lately.

13:18.671 --> 13:22.178
Lately? Was she not
usually happy?

13:22.538 --> 13:28.046
Well, Jody's not
the outgoing type.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.507
She never had very many friends.

13:30.632 --> 13:32.671
She never got married.

13:33.022 --> 13:35.218
A few months ago
she met someone.

13:35.303 --> 13:36.365
Who?

13:36.522 --> 13:37.827
Johnny.

13:38.413 --> 13:39.863
Nice guy.

13:40.498 --> 13:44.366
When they came to visit,
he brought me flowers.

13:44.507 --> 13:46.718
Do you happen to know
Johnny's last name?

13:46.843 --> 13:49.372
Because we probably
should talk to him.

13:49.413 --> 13:52.288
Ohh. I'm sorry.

13:52.462 --> 13:55.233
My brain's not as sharp
as it used to be.

13:55.272 --> 13:58.042
I only saw him once.

13:58.428 --> 14:01.050
She was so happy.

14:01.874 --> 14:05.780
Why would somebody
do this to her?

14:05.891 --> 14:08.124
Why?

14:15.147 --> 14:18.858
This is the man
we think took Jody.

14:19.483 --> 14:25.241
And the reasons why
are very complicated.

14:32.193 --> 14:33.998
Do you recognize him?

14:37.608 --> 14:39.789
That's Johnny.

14:40.358 --> 14:42.608
This guy is an escaped convict,

14:42.655 --> 14:45.358
Face all over the news, cops
everywhere looking for him,

14:45.420 --> 14:48.311
- What does he do?
- He settles down and finds a girlfriend.

14:48.397 --> 14:50.475
And we profiled Yates
as an introvert

14:50.522 --> 14:51.677
With limited social skills...

14:51.701 --> 14:53.381
How does a guy like
that find a girlfriend?

14:53.412 --> 14:56.303
Jody Wilson was an introvert
with limited social skills, too.

14:56.373 --> 14:57.740
They were perfect
for each other.

14:57.842 --> 15:00.350
Jody Wilson's SUV was just
discovered outside of Richmond.

15:00.490 --> 15:01.740
He must have abandoned it.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.091
Probably stole another one.

15:03.150 --> 15:04.998
That's actually
a really good guess,

15:05.023 --> 15:07.557
because her savings account
was just emptied, too.

15:07.686 --> 15:09.498
Richmond.
He's moving south.

15:09.647 --> 15:10.820
Is that the M.E. Report?

15:10.856 --> 15:12.255
Yeah. And the cause
of death

15:12.326 --> 15:13.365
is exactly what
you think it would be.

15:13.389 --> 15:14.975
What about stomach contents?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.147
Partially digested eggs,
Bacon, and...

15:17.172 --> 15:19.264
Ok. Ok. If I'd wanted to know,
I would have read it myself.

15:19.288 --> 15:21.483
He didn't starve her?
Let me see that.

15:21.694 --> 15:23.388
It may have been because
he didn't have time.

15:23.412 --> 15:24.498
He is on the run.

15:24.526 --> 15:25.756
But he did have time.

15:25.781 --> 15:28.194
Jody Wilson was his girlfriend.
He's had weeks.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.272
I'm curious,

15:29.307 --> 15:32.108
why he suddenly tried
to be intimate with women.

15:32.170 --> 15:33.201
He hates women.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.611
His childhood was a living hell.

15:34.646 --> 15:36.443
And he spent the better part
of his adulthood,

15:36.467 --> 15:38.147
as a serial killer.

15:38.881 --> 15:42.381
What if he just wanted
to be normal for once?

15:42.466 --> 15:45.678
So he's trying to achieve
some kind of idealized fantasy,

15:45.740 --> 15:47.694
like... playing house.

15:47.772 --> 15:51.490
And then when he realized he would
never fulfill that fantasy,

15:51.552 --> 15:53.432
He killed the woman
who made him think he could.

15:53.483 --> 15:56.405
So what's Yates' next move?

15:56.990 --> 15:59.405
He'll find another victim.

16:14.019 --> 16:15.764
I was wondering
when you might call.

16:15.897 --> 16:17.059
Hiya, Dave.

16:17.084 --> 16:20.218
We, uh, found Jody's
SUV, you know.

16:21.108 --> 16:23.139
We're gonna find you soon, too.

16:23.228 --> 16:25.295
Promises, promises.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.198
I, um, got a question
for you, Tommy.

16:29.303 --> 16:30.303
Shoot.

16:30.413 --> 16:31.545
I mean, you didn't really think

16:31.569 --> 16:35.194
You'd have any... kind
of normal life with Jody,

16:35.264 --> 16:38.373
Did you?
I mean, come on.

16:38.545 --> 16:41.553
Huh. Guess that's something
we got in common.

16:41.897 --> 16:44.580
Joy, Kai, Hayden.

16:44.819 --> 16:47.259
You don't actually think you could
have a normal life, do you?

16:47.303 --> 16:49.218
You stay the hell away
from my family.

16:49.326 --> 16:51.842
Nah. Me and you
are the same that way.

16:51.920 --> 16:52.934
What's that saying?

16:52.959 --> 16:54.584
"Be careful hunting monsters,

16:54.670 --> 16:55.468
lest you become one yourself."

16:55.493 --> 16:58.530
I swear to god, Yates, if
anything happens to them...

16:58.608 --> 17:00.748
Ah. Ain't that sweet.

17:00.889 --> 17:03.545
Papa bear's protective.
That's good.

17:03.764 --> 17:05.334
Family's important, right?

17:05.506 --> 17:08.138
Better enjoy 'em while you can.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.709
Never know how much time
you have left.

17:10.998 --> 17:13.381
Ah. Enough with the small talk.

17:13.513 --> 17:16.631
I just called to tell you I've
gone and done it again, Dave.

17:16.951 --> 17:18.599
She told me her name is Amber.

17:18.685 --> 17:22.054
Funny, 'cause her license
says Regina Franklin.

17:22.252 --> 17:24.771
She'll be buried
at Patapsco State Park,

17:24.865 --> 17:26.685
where the river bend
meets route 40,

17:26.849 --> 17:28.889
right near a great big old tree.

17:28.967 --> 17:31.405
I'll take her gag off
so you can hear her.

17:31.858 --> 17:33.115
No!

17:33.459 --> 17:35.498
No! No!

17:58.577 --> 18:01.157
First he heads south
toward Richmond,

18:01.185 --> 18:04.570
and then he bounces
back up north to Baltimore.

18:04.719 --> 18:06.016
Which way is he heading?

18:06.125 --> 18:09.859
Hopefully the roadblocks
will keep him hemmed in.

18:11.812 --> 18:12.995
Agents, over here, please!

18:13.031 --> 18:15.203
Oh, damn it, how'd they
find out already?

18:15.492 --> 18:17.094
My gut says Yates told them.

18:17.266 --> 18:18.667
What, you think
he wants attention?

18:18.703 --> 18:21.337
He didn't profile
as narcissitic.

18:22.094 --> 18:24.594
No. He want to humilate me.

18:24.851 --> 18:28.203
I'll handle them. You guys
check out the crime scene.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.287
Excuse me, agent.
Can you confirm

18:30.312 --> 18:32.715
That this is the work
of the Womb Rauder?

18:33.547 --> 18:34.906
No, I cannot.

18:35.023 --> 18:36.226
And let me be clear.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.687
"Womb Raider" is a nickname
you gave him.

18:38.723 --> 18:40.930
His real name is Tommy Yates.

18:41.062 --> 18:43.659
And I call him "murderer."

18:51.078 --> 18:53.695
Her name is Regina Franklin.

18:53.734 --> 18:56.117
26-year-old prostitute
and Meth addict.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.774
She was originally from Tampa
but moved to Baltimore

18:58.859 --> 19:01.492
after she dropped out of her
senior year of high school.

19:01.587 --> 19:04.461
The M.E. found 37 stab wounds

19:04.515 --> 19:06.469
to her genitalia
and lower abdomen,

19:06.562 --> 19:07.583
10 to the throat.

19:07.618 --> 19:10.305
But Yates is usally more surgical
than that. Why so sloppy?

19:10.367 --> 19:13.289
Good catch. We think it's because
he gave us his exact location,

19:13.324 --> 19:15.624
he had to move fast because
he knew we were coming.

19:15.660 --> 19:16.969
She had defensive wounds.

19:17.070 --> 19:19.266
Yes. The M.E. Believes that
she tried to fight back

19:19.328 --> 19:21.523
at some point, probably
when he first grabbed her.

19:21.664 --> 19:23.680
She also had someone else's
blood on her,

19:23.758 --> 19:25.501
enough to run a sample
through CODIS

19:25.536 --> 19:28.304
and we were able to confirm
that it belongs to Yates.

19:28.339 --> 19:31.240
Excuse me. Sorry.
I was listening

19:31.275 --> 19:34.779
To your conversation with
Yates and I heard something.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.217
Family's important, right?

19:37.443 --> 19:39.709
Better enjoy them while you can.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.232
You never know how much
time you got left.

19:42.318 --> 19:44.225
Clearly he's threatening
me and my family.

19:44.355 --> 19:46.404
That's what I thought,
too, but listen again.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.373
Family's important, right?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.793
Better enjoy them while you can.

19:51.115 --> 19:54.076
You never know how much
time you got left.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.021
He doesn't sound
very threatening.

19:56.178 --> 19:57.342
He sounds sad.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.367
Exactly.

19:58.415 --> 20:00.048
So what are you thinking?

20:01.021 --> 20:02.630
"You never know how much
time you got left."

20:02.654 --> 20:05.061
Maybe he wasn't talking
about you.

20:05.451 --> 20:07.639
Maybe he was talking
about himself.

20:08.561 --> 20:09.967
We need to talk to the m.E.

20:10.123 --> 20:13.264
And I want to see Yates'
prison medical records.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.118
It might be time
to deliver the profile.

20:16.670 --> 20:19.451
Tommy Yates removes his
victims' reproductive organs

20:19.529 --> 20:21.975
because he hates the fact
that he was even born.

20:22.045 --> 20:24.092
His latest victim
is 26 years old.

20:24.178 --> 20:25.872
Now, that's a departure for him.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.604
Historically his victims have been
right around the same age he is.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.240
This shift is about
availability.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.615
Regina was a prostitute,
a drug addict.

20:32.787 --> 20:33.998
She was an easy target.

20:34.068 --> 20:36.576
And he needs easy targets,
now more than ever before.

20:36.717 --> 20:40.240
Luckily, the Coroner recovered
a recent sample of his blood.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.693
And when we had it tested,
we found out

20:42.756 --> 20:43.936
that Yates has cancer.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.436
We're not sure what type,

20:45.498 --> 20:46.849
but we know he's a smoker

20:46.990 --> 20:48.795
and his grandmother died
from lung cancer.

20:48.927 --> 20:51.841
So now we think his victim's
age no longer matters.

20:51.967 --> 20:54.014
And he's definitely
got transportation,

20:54.123 --> 20:57.006
probably a Van or a truck
and probably stolen.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.527
In the past, he typically moved

20:58.563 --> 21:00.930
from high-risk lifestyle
victims to low-risk,

21:00.990 --> 21:02.865
so he may be about to up
his game somehow.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.365
He used to starve and hold
his victims for days.

21:05.506 --> 21:07.537
He seems to have skipped
that step with the last two.

21:07.561 --> 21:09.826
We believe that
because Yates is sick

21:09.959 --> 21:11.537
and feels that he's
running out of time.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.514
Unfortunately, that sentiment
could push him towards

21:14.592 --> 21:16.725
some kind of a spree.

21:17.420 --> 21:20.282
He may want to kill
as many people as he can

21:20.373 --> 21:21.951
before he goes out himself.

21:26.092 --> 21:28.691
When serial killers
know their death is imminent,

21:28.818 --> 21:31.264
they typically either feel
the urge to confess

21:31.490 --> 21:33.037
or they try to go out
with a bang,

21:33.146 --> 21:35.232
so they can go down in history.

21:35.443 --> 21:38.998
His killing again, Yates seems
to be leaning toward the latter.

21:39.193 --> 21:43.846
So we think he may try
to do that somehow through me.

21:48.631 --> 21:50.112
Yeah?

21:50.779 --> 21:52.045
All right.

21:52.139 --> 21:54.131
Look, if you need anything,

21:54.232 --> 21:56.919
you just call me, ok?

21:57.670 --> 21:59.788
I love you, too.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.239
Hey.

22:04.598 --> 22:06.239
Hey.

22:06.466 --> 22:09.153
Everything quiet
on the homefront?

22:09.887 --> 22:12.901
No. My daughter
and my grandson

22:12.937 --> 22:14.333
are sleeping in the safe house,

22:14.419 --> 22:16.450
and her mother, well,

22:16.598 --> 22:20.142
she never loved the perks
of this job to begin with.

22:20.177 --> 22:21.777
You should go home
and get some rest.

22:21.812 --> 22:24.036
Is this you being
the compassionate boss?

22:24.114 --> 22:26.872
No, this is me being
the compassionate friend.

22:27.044 --> 22:28.851
You keep burning the candle
at both ends,

22:28.886 --> 22:30.166
There won't be much of you left.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.739
Wait a minute.
I say that.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.348
What, are you using
my sayings against me?

22:34.379 --> 22:37.575
I am. And it's true.
That's why it's a good saying.

22:37.692 --> 22:40.262
Go get some rest.
No case was solved in a day.

22:40.341 --> 22:41.512
And that's another one.

22:41.537 --> 22:44.571
I know. What do you want?
I learned from the best.

22:45.137 --> 22:48.466
Look, I appreciate
your concern, but I'm fine.

22:48.841 --> 22:50.723
Really.

22:52.137 --> 22:53.909
All right.

22:57.481 --> 22:59.214
What's for dinner?
I'm buying.

22:59.411 --> 23:00.645
Ohh...

23:00.794 --> 23:02.411
Don't make that face.
I'm starving

23:02.489 --> 23:04.520
and I know you haven't eaten.

23:05.255 --> 23:09.012
Ok. I'll get a meatball
sandwich from Riggio's.

23:09.161 --> 23:10.526
They don't deliver this late.

23:10.622 --> 23:13.278
Oh, they do for me.

23:29.231 --> 23:31.176
Hey. Need a ride?

23:31.396 --> 23:34.831
It's 100. 50 if you want
something quick.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.051
Can I have one of
them cigarettes?

23:53.309 --> 23:56.622
Definitely.

23:58.208 --> 24:00.200
Thanks.

24:00.966 --> 24:03.247
I'm glad they're not
mentholated.

24:04.066 --> 24:06.150
Keep going straight.

24:11.676 --> 24:12.721
You ok?

24:12.757 --> 24:14.106
[continues coughing, wheezing]

24:14.270 --> 24:17.092
You need some water
or something?

24:18.317 --> 24:21.263
No. No. I'm fine.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.864
You don't look fine.

24:25.950 --> 24:28.356
These damn things'll kill ya.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.247
Hand me that bag, please.

24:44.262 --> 24:46.301
I'm gonna need you to cooperate.

24:46.457 --> 24:47.790
And be very quiet

24:48.161 --> 24:49.997
While I call
a friend of mine. Ok?

24:50.113 --> 24:51.332
Please...

24:51.591 --> 24:52.622
Ok?

24:53.067 --> 24:54.466
Please...

25:01.415 --> 25:03.485
This one's
not carrying I.D.,

25:03.649 --> 25:06.314
but she says her name's
Brandi, with an "I."

25:06.339 --> 25:08.045
You don't need
to keep doing this.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.206
You've got my attention.

25:09.276 --> 25:10.425
You know what?

25:10.491 --> 25:14.183
I think I'll take my time
with her... old school.

25:14.248 --> 25:16.581
You deserve that.
You know what else?

25:16.687 --> 25:18.394
You're never gonna find her.

25:18.581 --> 25:22.636
[Brandi crying and screaming]

25:22.925 --> 25:24.901
Please!

25:25.097 --> 25:26.997
Agent Rossi, it's been two days

25:27.033 --> 25:28.206
since you got that call.

25:28.292 --> 25:30.234
What do you think?
Is she still alive?

25:30.269 --> 25:32.251
I think there's a chance, yes.

25:32.376 --> 25:35.454
And he did say, "I think
I'll take my time with her..."

25:35.509 --> 25:36.665
Old school."

25:36.783 --> 25:38.720
That probably means
he's gonna starve her

25:38.767 --> 25:40.544
before he kills her,
just like he used to.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.880
But why now is he just
giving you the victim's name

25:42.915 --> 25:45.564
but not the location of where
he's going to bury her?

25:45.751 --> 25:48.329
We think that's
a sadistic attempt

25:48.423 --> 25:50.921
to mentally torture agent Rossi.

25:50.957 --> 25:53.023
It's also Yates'
way of staying connected.

25:53.059 --> 25:56.400
The relationship with agent Rossi
must validate him somehow.

25:56.533 --> 25:58.220
So what's our next move?

25:58.283 --> 26:00.197
We're in what I call a tweener.

26:00.298 --> 26:04.087
We've scoured every report,
exhausted every resource,

26:04.228 --> 26:05.251
turned every stone.

26:05.329 --> 26:06.415
What, so now we wait?

26:06.440 --> 26:09.314
Well, we're on high alert.
The manhunt is still active,

26:09.370 --> 26:11.158
So we're not exactly waiting.

26:11.330 --> 26:14.727
But every investigation,
at this point,

26:14.837 --> 26:16.923
requires Patience.

26:17.032 --> 26:19.483
But most of all, focus.

26:19.518 --> 26:22.907
Because all the answers
aren't all out there.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.134
Most are right here.

26:25.191 --> 26:26.798
And that's the job.

26:27.094 --> 26:31.161
That's why we get into
the mind of the killer.

26:31.204 --> 26:33.404
And if you can't
get into your own head,

26:33.432 --> 26:36.188
You're never gonna
get into someone else's.

26:36.321 --> 26:39.737
And the way we do that
is we need a process,

26:39.821 --> 26:41.555
and we've all got one.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.235
I play the Trombone.

26:43.305 --> 26:44.642
I go to the shooting range.

26:44.677 --> 26:46.310
Meditation. Jigsaw puzzles.

26:46.345 --> 26:50.141
I even know a guy who likes
to box to find his zen.

26:50.298 --> 26:51.415
So what do you do?

26:51.501 --> 26:53.993
Me? I cook.

26:54.837 --> 26:56.006
Always the same dish.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.102
Spaghetti Alla Carbonara.

26:58.251 --> 27:02.094
My grandmother's specialty.

27:02.502 --> 27:05.169
The prep work, it relaxes me.

27:05.524 --> 27:08.344
Something about the smell
reminds me of my childhood.

27:08.477 --> 27:10.801
And because I've done it
so many times,

27:10.946 --> 27:13.305
the process has become
second nature.

27:13.391 --> 27:15.915
Like Yates and his process.

27:16.063 --> 27:19.665
Cooking, if you will,
is my ritual.

27:20.407 --> 27:23.227
And then I sit and eat,

27:23.399 --> 27:26.602
but in my head, I'm having
dinner with the unsub,

27:26.688 --> 27:28.329
whoever that might be.

27:28.430 --> 27:30.571
See, to get the right answers,

27:30.751 --> 27:34.204
First you gotta ask
the right questions.

27:34.384 --> 27:35.766
How do you like it?

27:38.212 --> 27:39.430
Delicious.

27:39.657 --> 27:41.031
What is that, Bacon?

27:41.308 --> 27:42.407
Pancetta.

27:42.524 --> 27:44.657
Never heard of it.

27:45.625 --> 27:47.678
Not big on manners, are you?

27:48.040 --> 27:49.907
My grandma was into manners.

27:50.298 --> 27:52.076
Always hated that bitch.

27:52.173 --> 27:53.415
I get it.

27:53.501 --> 27:55.766
She starved you, beat you,

27:55.977 --> 27:58.182
made you wear dresses.

27:58.329 --> 28:01.852
You know, she used to
sit on me, too.

28:01.962 --> 28:05.923
Can you imagine, that fat
cow sitting on a kid?

28:06.025 --> 28:11.061
And all that time, you must have
wondered about your mother.

28:11.438 --> 28:13.864
But most of all, you wondered

28:14.087 --> 28:16.821
how she could die

28:16.885 --> 28:19.212
while she was giving you life.

28:20.019 --> 28:22.657
Always hated that bitch, too.

28:22.915 --> 28:26.844
Yeah. That's the thing
that always makes you snap.

28:27.101 --> 28:30.453
That hate... is what feeds
your compulsion.

28:30.516 --> 28:33.485
Fancy talk. But you still
don't know where to find me.

28:33.641 --> 28:35.735
Tick tock.

28:36.644 --> 28:38.403
The one thing
I really want to know

28:38.434 --> 28:41.833
is, what changed in prison?

28:43.184 --> 28:44.614
You tell me.

28:46.106 --> 28:48.606
No more hunting,
no more killing.

28:48.973 --> 28:51.481
No more being
one step ahead of us,

28:51.559 --> 28:53.606
drove me crazy.

28:53.739 --> 28:55.405
But not for long.

28:55.997 --> 28:59.109
Because that's when
you came up with the deal,

28:59.575 --> 29:01.278
The birthday visits.

29:01.465 --> 29:04.864
That's how you tried
to get your power back.

29:05.129 --> 29:06.536
This is old news.

29:06.684 --> 29:09.629
Only thing that matters
is where I am right now.

29:09.793 --> 29:13.290
Because you know I won't
be able to wait long.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.959
- But sooner or later...
- Mmm.

29:24.493 --> 29:27.571
And since I'm revealing
all of my vices,

29:27.696 --> 29:31.196
I also have a fondness
for cigars.

29:31.343 --> 29:35.000
It's a rare indulgence
I allow myself.

29:35.305 --> 29:38.118
A habit forged in the... crucible

29:38.188 --> 29:41.752
of the jungles of Vietnam
during wartime.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.766
It helps me think.

29:44.124 --> 29:45.750
Usually it's an Opus X.

29:45.836 --> 29:47.797
But if they ever lift
that Cuban embargo,

29:47.836 --> 29:51.196
I might expand my horizons.

29:55.258 --> 29:57.434
Got a light?

30:18.928 --> 30:20.657
How sick are you?

30:20.866 --> 30:22.025
It's all relative.

30:22.209 --> 30:23.360
Cancer.

30:24.217 --> 30:25.725
It's gonna get ugly.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.467
Especially without treatment.

30:27.616 --> 30:28.788
Even with treatment.

30:28.827 --> 30:29.947
You think I don't know that?

30:29.984 --> 30:32.881
Of course you do. That's
what this is all about...

30:32.975 --> 30:36.217
Not going quietly
into the night.

30:36.506 --> 30:40.310
But... why all of this focus on me?

30:40.686 --> 30:44.181
I mean, I would understand
you going back to killing,

30:44.216 --> 30:46.795
But... why am I so special?

30:46.849 --> 30:48.369
I bet you'd like to know,
wouldn't you?

30:48.442 --> 30:51.631
The obvious answer
is, you want payback.

30:51.685 --> 30:53.842
Yes, that is indeed obvious.

30:53.967 --> 30:55.756
I took away your ritual

30:55.866 --> 30:58.022
and stole all of your power.

30:58.428 --> 31:00.430
I locked you up
and threw away the key.

31:00.466 --> 31:02.468
Blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah.

31:02.632 --> 31:04.368
But the irony of it is,

31:04.945 --> 31:08.757
I may be the only person
in your life

31:09.015 --> 31:13.039
who truly made you feel special.

31:13.398 --> 31:17.812
So, what is it that you want?

31:18.929 --> 31:20.156
To make history.

31:20.263 --> 31:22.085
Now who's being obvious?

31:22.312 --> 31:24.414
You don't need me
to make history.

31:24.609 --> 31:26.695
This is personal.

31:26.773 --> 31:27.984
Interesting.

31:28.029 --> 31:31.289
You already have bodies
out there that I'll never find.

31:32.085 --> 31:36.921
So why do you need to torture
me with these new ones?

31:38.507 --> 31:40.656
Because you're dying.

31:41.023 --> 31:42.492
You don't want to be forgotten.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.171
You need me to remember.

31:45.624 --> 31:48.249
So, what I need to know

31:48.483 --> 31:50.287
Is what are you gonna do next?

31:50.316 --> 31:51.789
The suspense is killing me.

31:51.814 --> 31:53.796
You'll go back to what you know.

31:54.171 --> 31:57.320
- That's why you're starving her again.
- Go on.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.671
Then when she's good and weak,

32:01.343 --> 32:04.795
You'll cut out her reproductive
organs and vocal chords as usual,

32:04.830 --> 32:07.039
and then you'll bury her.

32:07.406 --> 32:09.166
But you won't tell me where.

32:09.201 --> 32:11.874
Come on! This is Bush League.

32:11.976 --> 32:13.937
That's the best you got?

32:14.210 --> 32:16.624
The rookies in your class
could do better than this.

32:16.734 --> 32:18.241
Where are you gonna
bury her, Yates?

32:18.277 --> 32:21.093
Someplace you'll never find her.

32:21.312 --> 32:23.843
Yeah. You said that already.

32:24.242 --> 32:26.917
But to get to me,
to really get to me,

32:27.140 --> 32:29.453
Where would you put her?

32:30.210 --> 32:32.255
Hmm...

32:40.578 --> 32:43.718
Garcia, I think I know
where he may be going.

33:02.632 --> 33:03.824
Please...

33:03.930 --> 33:06.030
We're here.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.563
I have seen everyone.

33:15.588 --> 33:18.446
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

33:18.517 --> 33:22.243
But, uh, last night,
technically this morning,

33:22.486 --> 33:25.228
We've made some headway
on the case

33:25.446 --> 33:28.470
and we were able
to locate... Tommy Yates.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.626
Yes!

33:29.743 --> 33:32.036
Because agent Rossi
himself became essential

33:32.071 --> 33:34.407
to Yates' M.O., we knew
he wouldn't go far.

33:34.517 --> 33:35.861
In fact, quite the opposite.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.575
Yates figured the best way
to get to me

33:37.620 --> 33:41.814
was to, uh, bury a victim I
knew about right under my nose.

33:41.907 --> 33:43.525
We reviewed all the transcripts

33:43.603 --> 33:47.384
of every conversation agent
Rossi ever had with Yates.

33:47.509 --> 33:49.520
To build rapport
and earn his trust,

33:49.555 --> 33:52.892
I, uh, I told him
certain things about me.

33:53.103 --> 33:56.220
Some I made up.
Some were true.

33:56.431 --> 33:59.931
For example, the name
of the park I like to walk in.

34:00.111 --> 34:03.681
We covered the park and the
areas surrounding the base,

34:03.767 --> 34:06.509
even the playground across
the street from a restaurant

34:06.587 --> 34:08.306
Agent Rossi told Yates about.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.540
That's when I realized

34:09.574 --> 34:13.134
that none of these places
were close enough.

34:15.266 --> 34:18.969
I was headed to the office
when it hit me.

35:15.541 --> 35:16.939
Let her go, Yates!

35:17.462 --> 35:19.844
I was hoping I might
run into you, Dave.

35:20.071 --> 35:23.564
Well, this is my land. And I
remembered you like trees.

35:23.767 --> 35:25.454
Right there's
the biggest one I got.

35:25.618 --> 35:27.651
Beautiful piece of property.

35:27.970 --> 35:30.142
6 acres you said, right?

35:30.517 --> 35:33.457
Let her go, Yates.
It's all over.

35:36.910 --> 35:38.676
Tell you what.

35:38.957 --> 35:42.050
How about you just
let me go die in peace

35:42.261 --> 35:43.634
And we forget this whole thing.

35:43.669 --> 35:45.261
You know I can't do that.

35:45.355 --> 35:47.253
So why don't you just
put the knife down,

35:47.316 --> 35:50.508
I'll take you in, we'll both
have a good night's sleep.

35:50.668 --> 35:52.207
See...

35:52.355 --> 35:53.824
Here's the thing.

35:54.401 --> 35:56.221
I'm not going back to jail.

35:56.589 --> 35:59.082
I'm not gonna die in there.

35:59.878 --> 36:01.769
But the problem is,

36:02.086 --> 36:05.128
if you shoot me, you save her,

36:05.316 --> 36:06.464
But then I can't tell you

36:06.511 --> 36:09.582
Where I buried all those
other girls over the years.

36:09.988 --> 36:11.539
Let her go.

36:12.175 --> 36:15.175
But if you don't shoot me,

36:15.410 --> 36:16.534
I'm gonna kill her.

36:16.569 --> 36:17.949
Yates!

36:19.347 --> 36:23.064
I told you, I'm not going back.

36:35.408 --> 36:38.111
Brandi's real name
is Stephanie Wetherbee.

36:38.424 --> 36:39.908
She was a runaway
from Philadelphia

36:40.018 --> 36:42.408
who hadn't seen her family
in over 10 years.

36:42.462 --> 36:47.298
So we found her mother
and fixed that.

36:53.766 --> 36:56.440
Oh, baby.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.493
We found Regina Franklin's
parents in Tampa.

36:59.618 --> 37:03.008
I offered to fly down
and talk to them personally,

37:03.493 --> 37:05.969
But apparently her mother
has a cousin who lives here,

37:06.055 --> 37:09.509
So... we flew them up instead.

37:10.337 --> 37:12.022
Some cases end well

37:12.180 --> 37:15.454
and you can... forget about them.

37:16.274 --> 37:18.399
But some some become a part

37:18.631 --> 37:20.657
of who you are.

37:21.192 --> 37:23.274
This job is going to change you.

37:23.469 --> 37:25.727
And not only that,
it's going to show you

37:25.876 --> 37:28.399
who you really are.

37:28.665 --> 37:31.938
And sometimes
that's not easy to see.

37:32.180 --> 37:35.282
And that's why not
everybody can do this job.

37:35.430 --> 37:38.696
And that's why
we train like we do.

37:38.784 --> 37:41.579
Because lives depend upon it.

37:46.298 --> 37:49.793
Now, agents prentiss
and Walker were kind enough

37:49.876 --> 37:54.265
to, um, hold on to this for me.

37:54.884 --> 37:57.568
I owe you all an apology.

37:57.993 --> 38:00.352
'Cause this was
a very thoughtful gift.

38:00.438 --> 38:04.173
And what I should have done
was say thank you.

38:08.391 --> 38:10.079
So to make up for it,

38:10.259 --> 38:13.196
I'm inviting you all
to my home tonight for dinner.

38:13.415 --> 38:15.048
7:30 sharp.

38:15.188 --> 38:19.329
Now, I've got a few minutes before
I have to go in and debrief.

38:19.915 --> 38:21.509
Are there any questions?

38:23.625 --> 38:24.857
Excuse me.

38:25.016 --> 38:27.181
Agent Rossi,
do you have a second?

38:27.266 --> 38:29.485
Agent Clark,
what can I do for you?

38:29.641 --> 38:33.170
Um, I want to say
thank you, sir.

38:33.509 --> 38:36.473
Um, but I'm leaving the program.

38:36.868 --> 38:39.171
Why? You're one of
the most promising

38:39.196 --> 38:41.446
young coordinators we have.

38:41.688 --> 38:43.821
Thank you, sir.
That means a lot.

38:43.916 --> 38:46.850
Um... But I just
got engaged

38:46.938 --> 38:50.352
and I can't bring
that insanity home.

38:50.516 --> 38:52.579
I mean, that Yates case.

38:52.806 --> 38:55.782
Sorry, I'm sorry, but I just don't have
to deal with it the way you have.

38:55.852 --> 38:58.790
It takes time
to build those skills.

38:59.727 --> 39:03.220
That's just it, sir. I don't
know if I want those skills.

39:03.516 --> 39:05.899
I just can't have this
become my life.

39:06.259 --> 39:08.563
I hope you understand.

39:09.561 --> 39:11.860
I want to say thank you,
though, agent Rossi,

39:11.962 --> 39:14.745
- for everything.
- It's been an honor.

39:15.079 --> 39:16.962
Good luck.

39:17.337 --> 39:18.938
Thanks.

39:38.147 --> 39:39.247
You all right?

39:39.335 --> 39:41.140
Yeah.

39:41.593 --> 39:44.375
I heard about agent Clark.

39:44.913 --> 39:47.257
It's a shame.
I liked him, too.

39:56.044 --> 39:57.397
I never told you this,

39:57.466 --> 40:01.925
But the first case I worked
after I took your class...

40:02.802 --> 40:06.075
It, uh, well, it went sideways.

40:06.325 --> 40:08.866
I had a team of people
operating in deep cover

40:08.901 --> 40:12.403
inside a cell in Belgium, and...

40:13.294 --> 40:16.262
We lost them, all 3 of them.

40:16.833 --> 40:18.864
My profile was off.

40:19.098 --> 40:20.878
But we got the cell.

40:21.036 --> 40:23.044
They were planning
to bomb a soccer match,

40:23.161 --> 40:25.575
and it would have been
a catastrophe.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.520
I never heard about that.

40:27.716 --> 40:30.802
Joint Taskforce with the CIA.
They kept it quiet.

40:30.923 --> 40:33.825
You can't... blame yourself,
you know.

40:33.989 --> 40:37.973
Those deep cover agents,
they volunteered.

40:38.075 --> 40:39.463
I don't.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.832
At least not anymore.

40:42.630 --> 40:45.002
And that's because of you.

40:45.380 --> 40:48.591
We save lives,
and that's all that matters.

40:48.829 --> 40:50.731
And every life we save,
it's a win.

40:50.810 --> 40:53.177
You taught me that.

40:53.802 --> 40:55.512
"The life of the dead is placed

40:55.583 --> 40:59.316
in the memory
of the living."

40:59.747 --> 41:03.481
Marcus Tullius Cicero,

41:03.786 --> 41:07.424
and a lot of people
are living because of you.

41:07.809 --> 41:11.598
I hope you never forget that.

41:12.497 --> 41:16.809
Now, come on. You gotta cook
for a bunch of young agents.

41:17.456 --> 41:19.591
Non-Stop.
