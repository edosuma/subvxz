00:19.477 --> 00:20.710
Niagara ketchup!

00:20.711 --> 00:22.012
I don't get it.

00:22.013 --> 00:23.547
Oh, like Niagara Falls,
but with ketchup?

00:23.548 --> 00:24.881
No! Oh, yes.

00:24.916 --> 00:25.849
Kids, stop.

00:25.883 --> 00:27.884
You love Niagara ketchup!
Admit it!

00:27.885 --> 00:30.387
You want to get in a barrel
and be part of it! BOB: No.

00:30.388 --> 00:32.402
Dad, are you still
mad about the zester?

00:32.423 --> 00:33.857
Yes, of course I'm mad.

00:33.858 --> 00:35.325
You zested gum off Gene's shoe.

00:35.359 --> 00:37.394
Yeah. It's called
being a good sister.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.896
But now it's ruined.
You can never un-zest this.

00:39.931 --> 00:41.131
Can't we get
another zester?

00:41.165 --> 00:42.899
Not like this one.
It was perfect.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.802
I had more zest for this zester
than I do for life.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.704
It was simply
the zest. Ha, ha!

00:47.739 --> 00:48.839
Too soon.

00:48.873 --> 00:50.040
Yeah. Hey, Mike.

00:50.074 --> 00:51.541
You got some bills,

00:51.542 --> 00:53.210
and this one feels really weird

00:53.244 --> 00:54.778
if you squeeze it.
Oh, my God!

00:54.779 --> 00:56.713
A letter from
the community garden!

00:56.714 --> 00:58.515
Please let it say I'm accepted.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.751
Open it. Open it.
Open it. Open it!

01:00.752 --> 01:03.854
“Dear Mr. Belcher, we regret
to inform you...” Damn it!

01:03.855 --> 01:05.388
Aw!

01:05.390 --> 01:07.357
Oh, they sent a
packet of seeds.

01:07.392 --> 01:09.226
Consolation seeds.
I've been there.

01:09.227 --> 01:10.727
Why would they
send those?

01:10.762 --> 01:12.763
I don't know, Tina.
I guess to remind me

01:12.764 --> 01:14.431
of the beautiful place
that exists

01:14.432 --> 01:16.199
that I'll never get
to be a part of!

01:16.234 --> 01:17.530
Like the boys locker room.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.035
Or New York in the '90s!

01:19.070 --> 01:20.604
Cheer up, Bobby.
We could get you

01:20.605 --> 01:22.472
a little planter box
to hang from the window.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.040
It's not the same, Lin.

01:24.041 --> 01:25.709
It's not just about
growing a few things.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.144
It's about
working the land,

01:27.145 --> 01:28.812
growing produce for
the restaurant.

01:28.813 --> 01:30.881
If we had a yard, I'd do
it there, but we don't.

01:30.915 --> 01:32.382
Get off your high horse.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.550
Why don't you grow
some alley pumpkins?

01:33.584 --> 01:35.485
I want land!

01:35.486 --> 01:37.788
I'm a gardener trapped in the
body of an urban restaurateur.

01:37.789 --> 01:40.957
I have ground beef under my
fingernails, but it should be...

01:40.958 --> 01:42.459
ground beef and dirt!

01:42.493 --> 01:44.494
Ugh. Mike, I know you're
just the mailman,

01:44.495 --> 01:46.930
but I can't help
thinking you did this.

01:46.931 --> 01:49.299
Sure, blame me for this,
but you never thank me

01:49.300 --> 01:51.068
for the letters I don't deliver.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.148
Thank you.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.670
Bye-bye.

01:53.671 --> 01:55.238
There must be something
I can do to get in.

01:55.239 --> 01:56.673
You know what? I'm
gonna walk down there

01:56.674 --> 01:58.175
and talk to the
garden master.

01:58.176 --> 02:00.077
Oh, Cynthia? Good luck
with that piece of work.

02:00.111 --> 02:02.779
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cynthia as in Logan's mom?

02:02.780 --> 02:05.615
As in Logan, my archenemy?!
Yeah.

02:05.616 --> 02:07.417
Tell her to tell Logan
he's a... (blows raspberry).

02:07.418 --> 02:08.952
And his head looks like...
(blows raspberry).

02:08.953 --> 02:10.252
And his face sounds like...
(blows raspberry).

02:10.253 --> 02:11.755
He'll know what it means.

02:11.789 --> 02:13.824
I, uh... I probably
won't do that, Louise.

02:13.858 --> 02:15.325
Do you want me
to write it down then?

02:15.360 --> 02:16.793
Um, yeah, go ahead.

02:16.794 --> 02:18.362
You know, do what
you got to do, Bobby.

02:18.363 --> 02:20.263
If you have to sleep
with her to get in, it's okay.

02:20.264 --> 02:21.665
I don't like her,
but whatever it takes.

02:21.666 --> 02:23.133
Way ahead of
you, Lin.

02:26.371 --> 02:28.038
(birds chirping)

02:30.041 --> 02:31.975
It's so... perfect.

02:31.976 --> 02:33.377
Can I help you?

02:33.378 --> 02:35.512
Oh. Hi, Cynthia.
(sighs):
Oh.

02:35.513 --> 02:37.147
So, um, uh,
it's been a while

02:37.148 --> 02:38.849
since we were all
in my restaurant

02:38.850 --> 02:41.051
with all those bikers. With
all of those dirty bikers

02:41.052 --> 02:43.854
your daughter hired to cut off my
son's ears. And that baby was born.

02:43.855 --> 02:45.622
Weird day!
Right!

02:45.623 --> 02:47.691
But we don't... we don't
have to reminisce about that.

02:47.692 --> 02:49.226
Wait. Does that have
anything to do

02:49.227 --> 02:51.194
with me not getting
accepted to the garden?

02:51.195 --> 02:52.696
(chuckles):
Oh, of course not!

02:52.697 --> 02:53.930
Bygones.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.366
Well, my application
was rejected again,

02:56.367 --> 02:58.368
and I was wondering
if maybe I filled it out wrong.

02:58.369 --> 03:00.203
I did make a few jokes.

03:00.204 --> 03:02.005
Like where it asked,
“What are your hobbies?”

03:02.006 --> 03:03.373
I wrote, “Beets me!”

03:03.374 --> 03:05.375
Get it? Spelled B-E-E-T.

03:05.410 --> 03:07.411
Ugh!
Logan!

03:07.412 --> 03:08.845
It was an accident! Gah!

03:08.846 --> 03:10.447
It's hot!
He probably likes it!

03:10.481 --> 03:11.882
Ugh, sorry, Bob.
He's not...

03:11.883 --> 03:13.684
We're working on it.

03:13.685 --> 03:16.153
No, no, he's a... he's a great kid.
(scoffs)

03:16.187 --> 03:18.155
No, he's not,
but he will be.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.524
I'm trying to get him into this
college prep summer program,

03:20.525 --> 03:22.759
but he doesn't have enough
extracurricular activities.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.394
Like, uh, volunteering?

03:24.395 --> 03:26.096
(scoffs) Volunteering.
Everyone's doing that.

03:26.097 --> 03:27.698
You can't throw a rock

03:27.699 --> 03:29.366
without hitting a kid
volunteering at a hospice.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.769
Oh, I hate those kids
who volunteer at hospices.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.505
The newest thing is crappy
jobs that build character.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.241
You want to stand out, you
write an essay about that.

03:38.242 --> 03:40.510
Oh. What qualifies
as a crappy job?

03:40.511 --> 03:44.081
I don't know. Like sweeping
stuff or mopping something.

03:44.082 --> 03:47.184
You know, just some dead-end
job in a horrible place.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.886
I know a dead-end job
in a horrible place!

03:49.921 --> 03:51.755
(doorbells jingle)
BOB: Say hello to

03:51.789 --> 03:54.024
the newest member
of the community garden!

03:54.058 --> 03:55.525
Hello.
All right!

03:55.526 --> 03:57.027
Congrats, Dad.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.595
You did it, you old
son of a bitch!

03:58.630 --> 04:01.444
And say hello
to our newest employee!

04:02.567 --> 04:03.567
Logan?

04:03.568 --> 04:05.636
No! Dad!
Uh-huh.

04:05.637 --> 04:06.637
Uh-uh.
Uh-huh!

04:06.638 --> 04:07.704
Uh-uh!
Uh-huh!

04:07.739 --> 04:09.039
Uh-uh!
Uh-huh!

04:09.073 --> 04:10.474
Uh-uh!
Uh-uh!

04:10.475 --> 04:12.242
Uh, uh, uh!
Uh, uh, uh!

04:12.243 --> 04:15.166
See? You two are already
enjoying working together.

04:16.295 --> 04:18.630
(laughs):
Okay, you got me. It's a joke.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.599
You'd never really hire Logan.

04:20.632 --> 04:22.200
It's just
temporary, Louise.

04:22.201 --> 04:24.503
Logan's mom was nice
enough to find me a plot

04:24.504 --> 04:26.304
at the community
garden, because...

04:26.305 --> 04:28.140
Because he gave me
this crappy job.

04:28.141 --> 04:30.175
It's not crappy.
Don't-don't say that.

04:30.176 --> 04:32.277
But if your mom asks,
it's-it's crappy.

04:32.311 --> 04:34.179
Wait. You're paying
this butt brain?

04:34.213 --> 04:36.047
My butt does have brains.

04:36.048 --> 04:38.216
They're called turds,
and they're smarter than you.

04:38.217 --> 04:40.952
No, it's an
unpaid internship.

04:40.987 --> 04:43.321
Finally, we're getting a little
more sausage at this party.

04:43.322 --> 04:44.723
Yes, Gene.

04:44.724 --> 04:46.458
This is a terrible idea, Dad.

04:46.492 --> 04:48.693
You've taken the only good thing
about this restaurant...

04:48.694 --> 04:51.329
its lack of Logan-
and you added Logan!

04:51.330 --> 04:54.332
That is not appropriate
for the workplace.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.668
You are not appropriate
for the workplace!

04:56.669 --> 04:58.737
You're not appropriate
for your face!

04:58.738 --> 05:00.205
(groaning)

05:00.206 --> 05:01.506
(both groaning,
blowing raspberries)

05:01.541 --> 05:02.974
I bet when you
reconnect in your 30s,

05:02.975 --> 05:04.643
you guys will get married.

05:04.644 --> 05:06.044
Bob, if they're gonna
just fight the whole time,

05:06.045 --> 05:07.612
he's not gonna
be much help.

05:07.647 --> 05:09.414
BOB: Just let them get
it out of their system.

05:09.415 --> 05:10.816
It's almost like
they're playing.

05:10.850 --> 05:12.317
I'm okay with him.

05:12.318 --> 05:13.652
I can pick his brain
about mid-teen boys.

05:13.653 --> 05:15.353
Find out what tickles
their pits.

05:15.354 --> 05:16.922
That's a great attitude, Tina.

05:16.923 --> 05:18.890
Louise, can I see you
in the kitchen real fast?

05:18.891 --> 05:20.525
Louise, I really, really
want this garden.

05:20.526 --> 05:22.594
Plus, it will be good
for all of us.

05:22.595 --> 05:24.896
We're gonna grow fresh
produce for the restaurant.

05:24.897 --> 05:27.132
Doesn't that sound great?
Dad, I'm nine.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.401
I spit out vegetables
and hide them around the house.

05:29.435 --> 05:32.437
Louise, please, can you at least
try and get along with Logan?

05:32.438 --> 05:34.373
Just for a little
while? Do it for me?

05:34.374 --> 05:36.074
Fine.
Great! Thanks.

05:36.075 --> 05:38.543
But the first time
he even... (sighs)

05:38.578 --> 05:41.146
Okay, I'm off to the garden!
Is that my sun hat?

05:41.180 --> 05:42.514
Uh, yeah. Can I borrow it?

05:42.548 --> 05:44.416
I guess, but you look
like a British lady.

05:44.417 --> 05:46.385
I know. Thanks. Bye.

05:46.386 --> 05:47.919
Oh, my dirt.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.056
My sweet, sweet, sweet dirt.

05:51.090 --> 05:53.125
Hello, trowel.
You're gonna be digging.

05:53.126 --> 05:54.559
Hello, shears.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.061
You're gonna be trimming.

05:56.062 --> 05:57.963
I was so smart to buy you guys
five years ago.

05:57.964 --> 05:59.598
Everyone said,
"You don't have a garden.

05:59.599 --> 06:01.299
Why are you buying
gardening equipment?"

06:01.300 --> 06:03.602
And I said, “I'll grow into it.”

06:03.603 --> 06:04.970
(chuckles)

06:04.971 --> 06:07.239
Trowel? Right?

06:07.273 --> 06:09.541
Uh, sorry.
I-I didn't see...

06:09.542 --> 06:11.410
I thought I was alone.

06:11.444 --> 06:14.112
Okay, Logan,
fellow employee,

06:14.113 --> 06:15.647
this is the spot I've chosen

06:15.648 --> 06:17.749
for you to stand in
for the rest of the day.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.285
It's out of the way, we won't
have to smell or hear you,

06:20.286 --> 06:22.487
and when it's time
to punch out, there's the door.

06:22.488 --> 06:24.122
Oh, you're gonna
smell me.

06:24.123 --> 06:25.724
Smell it.
Take in the aroma.

06:25.725 --> 06:27.465
(chuckles)
High five.

06:27.493 --> 06:29.227
Wow, that was hard!

06:29.228 --> 06:31.430
I never knew high-fiving was
so violent and satisfying!

06:31.431 --> 06:33.231
My hand is a man now!

06:33.266 --> 06:34.599
Your hand is a bro.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.168
It is?
Let's bro again.

06:36.169 --> 06:38.070
(grunts)
Ow! Oh, yeah.

06:38.071 --> 06:39.404
Gene!
What?

06:39.439 --> 06:41.239
Everyone getting along
out there?

06:41.274 --> 06:43.875
You know it, Linda. I'm in
the mile- high-five club.

06:43.910 --> 06:46.445
Sounds great. Maybe I
wasn't clear, Logan.

06:46.446 --> 06:49.281
You stand in your spot,
face the wall, silently,

06:49.282 --> 06:52.217
till it's time to go home,
and everything will be fine.

06:52.251 --> 06:54.453
The way I see it, as long as
your dad wants his garden,

06:54.454 --> 06:56.321
I can do whatever I feel like.

06:56.356 --> 06:58.824
What? Yeah. Maybe
I'll go back to this.

06:58.825 --> 07:00.759
Oh, somebody order
a cup of cheese?

07:00.760 --> 07:02.294
'Cause that's what
it smells like.

07:02.295 --> 07:03.962
(yells)
Come on, Logan.

07:03.963 --> 07:05.530
Let's-let's go
in the back,

07:05.531 --> 07:07.366
and I'll show you how
to wash the dishes.

07:07.367 --> 07:09.034
Uh, we-we can dish
about the washing.

07:09.035 --> 07:10.469
(chuckles)

07:10.470 --> 07:12.371
So, uh, what do high
school boys talk about?

07:12.372 --> 07:14.206
Follow-up question.

07:14.207 --> 07:16.008
Do you talk about it in the
shower after you do sports?

07:16.009 --> 07:17.509
Additional
follow-up question.

07:17.510 --> 07:19.177
How hot is the water?
Does it produce steam?

07:19.178 --> 07:20.177
I'm asking for a friend.

07:20.179 --> 07:21.546
Yeah, that's classified,

07:21.547 --> 07:23.015
top-secret guy stuff, so...

07:23.016 --> 07:24.483
Right, right,
right, right.

07:24.484 --> 07:26.218
And towels- how
small are they?

07:26.219 --> 07:27.519
Like washcloth size?

07:27.520 --> 07:29.221
Uh...
Smaller?

07:29.222 --> 07:31.456
(sighs) I'll start folding this.
You say when.

07:31.457 --> 07:32.991
Huh? Huh?
Mm. Uh.

07:32.992 --> 07:34.493
Huh?
Ah...

07:34.494 --> 07:36.194
Like, what... I can't
even fold it more.

07:36.195 --> 07:38.430
Hey, Mom, how you doing?

07:38.464 --> 07:42.200
Good. So, are we really sure
this Logan thing is worth it?

07:42.235 --> 07:43.902
I mean, Dad's a family member,

07:43.903 --> 07:45.637
but he's ranked, like,
fourth or fifth.

07:45.672 --> 07:47.072
Louise, it's
not that bad.

07:47.073 --> 07:48.540
Plus, your father
needs this.

07:48.541 --> 07:50.008
And you owe him one.

07:50.009 --> 07:51.476
You de-zested
his zester.

07:51.477 --> 07:53.245
Let him have the garden.
(groans)

07:53.246 --> 07:56.415
Sometimes you just got to be
around people you don't like.

07:56.416 --> 07:57.849
Oh, look at this place.

07:57.884 --> 07:58.984
Oh, God, it's her.

07:59.018 --> 08:00.319
Oh, it's even more depressing

08:00.320 --> 08:01.486
than I remembered.

08:01.521 --> 08:02.688
How dare she.

08:02.722 --> 08:04.323
Oh, hi, Linda.

08:04.324 --> 08:05.891
I'm just here to help
Logan with his essay.

08:05.892 --> 08:06.891
Don't mind me.

08:06.893 --> 08:08.360
Oh, I won't, Cynthia.

08:08.361 --> 08:10.028
What were you saying, Mother?

08:10.029 --> 08:12.064
(whispers): Something about
people you don't like?

08:12.098 --> 08:13.532
Just pretend like I'm not here.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.300
Oh, but could I just get
a chamomile tea?

08:15.335 --> 08:16.868
I'm sorry, we
don't have that.

08:16.903 --> 08:19.671
Oh. Okay. Well, then just
bring me some hot water.

08:19.672 --> 08:21.907
And a lemon
and some chamomile tea.

08:21.908 --> 08:23.342
Oh, right, you don't have that.

08:23.343 --> 08:24.910
That's just... so weird.

08:24.911 --> 08:26.712
Anyway, hot water and lemon
would be great.

08:26.746 --> 08:27.612
Fine.

08:27.613 --> 08:29.114
Ew. Sticky.

08:29.115 --> 08:31.350
Logan? Logan!

08:31.384 --> 08:33.118
What?! I'm starting your essay
we're gonna say you wrote!

08:33.119 --> 08:34.553
Come out here
and sweep something

08:34.554 --> 08:35.854
so I can write about it!

08:35.888 --> 08:37.923
(grumbling)

08:39.392 --> 08:40.958
(grumbling)
Well, good night.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.062
Good night. Okay, Bob,
I'm just gonna say it.

08:44.063 --> 08:45.931
I know you love that garden,

08:45.932 --> 08:48.200
but now Cynthia's hanging out
at the restaurant, ordering tea.

08:48.201 --> 08:49.434
(screams)

08:49.435 --> 08:51.203
Hi. If I could
just jump in here,

08:51.204 --> 08:52.871
I don't know if I can
take Logan much longer

08:52.872 --> 08:54.106
before I slap
that mess.

08:54.107 --> 08:56.308
Yeah, how long is
this gonna last, Bob?

08:56.309 --> 08:58.110
Uh, probably just
until Logan gets

08:58.111 --> 09:00.779
into that summer program thing,
and then we're home free.

09:00.780 --> 09:02.247
Rolling in arugula.

09:02.248 --> 09:04.416
So just try and ignore
Cynthia and Logan.

09:04.417 --> 09:05.817
Start slapping
faces, got it.

09:05.818 --> 09:07.753
No! No slapping.
Just ignoring.

09:07.754 --> 09:10.589
Fine. But just so you know,
I got this guy and this guy,

09:10.623 --> 09:12.557
and they're ready
to go to work.

09:12.592 --> 09:15.994
Look at you. It's only been
a few days, and you're so big!

09:15.995 --> 09:18.664
(high-pitched): We know. And soon,
you'll be ready to get eaten.

09:18.665 --> 09:20.732
(high-pitched): What?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

09:20.733 --> 09:23.335
I for... I forgot you could
understand me, spoke English.

09:23.336 --> 09:26.438
I'm gonna tickle you now.
Huh? Huh?

09:26.439 --> 09:28.240
(high-pitched laughing)

09:28.241 --> 09:30.809

10:41.981 --> 10:43.515
Stop it!
(burps, blows air)

10:43.516 --> 10:46.151
Ew! Something should close
the door, huh? Stop it!

10:46.152 --> 10:47.686
High school age boys-
they're a handful.

10:47.687 --> 10:49.488
Handful of this.
(grunts)

10:49.489 --> 10:51.156
Gene!
Sorry.

10:51.157 --> 10:53.225
"These simple people were
doing the best they could

10:53.226 --> 10:54.760
"with what little
they had in their sad,

10:54.761 --> 10:56.194
underperforming
restaurant"?

10:56.195 --> 10:58.397
Hey, don't read that!

10:58.398 --> 10:59.698
“Simple people”?

10:59.699 --> 11:00.999
It's just an expression.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.234
It's for the essay.

11:02.235 --> 11:03.535
You know what, Cynthia?

11:03.536 --> 11:05.904
Nope. Do it for Bobby,
do it for Bobby.

11:05.905 --> 11:07.773
Uh-oh, we got
a low-pressure system

11:07.774 --> 11:09.908
moving in from the north
and a warm front

11:09.909 --> 11:12.611
moving in from the south.
(burps, blows air)

11:12.612 --> 11:14.613
Stink-a-cane!

11:14.614 --> 11:16.715
Son of a bitch!
Take shelter!

11:16.716 --> 11:18.750
Is “slop shop” one word or two?

11:18.751 --> 11:21.053
You know what you should write
about? A very violent event

11:21.054 --> 11:23.455
involving your computer
and a simple lady who snapped!

11:23.456 --> 11:25.357
Kids, get a mop!

11:25.358 --> 11:27.859
You're about to clean
Cynthia's laptop off the floor!

11:27.860 --> 11:30.028
Oh, yeah. Let's do this!

11:30.029 --> 11:31.963
Hands, time to get slappy.

11:31.964 --> 11:34.399
(exclaiming)
Wha...?

11:34.400 --> 11:37.235
Hi everyone.
How are things... going?

11:37.236 --> 11:38.870
Interesting
but scary.

11:38.871 --> 11:40.772
Everything's
going great!

11:40.773 --> 11:42.541
I was just about
to proofread

11:42.542 --> 11:44.242
Cynthia's essay
with my foot.

11:44.243 --> 11:45.610
And I was just gonna
use my hands

11:45.611 --> 11:47.446
to make a Logan face sandwich.

11:47.447 --> 11:48.714
(both grunting)

11:48.715 --> 11:50.082
Okay, uh, good.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.284
Cynthia, hello. Logan, hey.

11:52.285 --> 11:54.619
So, uh, you know,
a few bumps in the road

11:54.620 --> 11:55.921
are to be expected.

11:55.922 --> 11:58.390
This is more
than a few bumps, Bob.

11:58.391 --> 12:00.892
This was a bad idea.
Kiss your garden good-bye.

12:00.893 --> 12:02.227
Logan, we're leaving!

12:02.228 --> 12:03.495
Good!
Great!

12:03.496 --> 12:04.963
Bye.
Whoa, whoa, w-wait, wait.

12:04.964 --> 12:06.932
Where are you going?
Yeah, Dad. Don't.

12:06.933 --> 12:09.468
Let them go. I'll, uh...
I'll handle this.

12:09.469 --> 12:11.670
Look, I-I'm sure
we can figure this out.

12:11.671 --> 12:14.072
Is-is there anything
I can do to fix this?

12:14.073 --> 12:16.508
I-I will do anything
to make this work.

12:16.509 --> 12:18.443
I love your son.

12:18.444 --> 12:20.512
Look at Dad. He's really
laying into them.

12:20.513 --> 12:22.581
GENE: Maybe I should go out
there and hold him back.

12:22.582 --> 12:24.016
Nah, I don't think so.

12:24.017 --> 12:25.617
LINDA:
Aw, big papa bear Bobby

12:25.618 --> 12:27.586
looking out for his
cubs. You get 'em.

12:27.587 --> 12:30.322
LOUISE: I'm just glad this
nightmare on Logan Street is over.

12:30.323 --> 12:33.258
There's got to be something we
can do that will make you happy,

12:33.259 --> 12:36.595
make me happy,
make your essay happy.

12:36.596 --> 12:39.364
All right, Bob.
You told them off.

12:39.365 --> 12:41.266
Good job.
Yeah, well, uh...

12:41.267 --> 12:43.101
Did you hear someone yelling,
“Please Hammer, don't hurt 'em”?

12:43.102 --> 12:44.102
That was me.

12:44.103 --> 12:45.504
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Good.

12:45.505 --> 12:47.472
I thought you were gonna
keep taking that doofus's side,

12:47.473 --> 12:49.307
then I saw you out there,
and damn it

12:49.308 --> 12:51.109
if you didn't make me proud.

12:51.110 --> 12:53.679
Uh, okay. Um, a little
news to share, everyone.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.781
Uh, a-after a lot of
consideration,

12:55.782 --> 12:57.949
I've decided
to make Logan...

12:57.950 --> 12:59.551
employee
of the month.

12:59.552 --> 13:00.952
What?!
Bob!

13:00.953 --> 13:03.488
Wow. He hasn't even
been here a week. Good for him.

13:03.489 --> 13:05.123
N-Now, hear me out.
Louise...

13:05.124 --> 13:06.358
Ow, ow.
You're hurting me.

13:06.359 --> 13:08.460
Ow, ow!
Aw, Bob.

13:08.461 --> 13:10.862
(coughs)
Oh, my kidneys.

13:10.863 --> 13:12.864
You're so small, but
you're so strong.

13:12.865 --> 13:14.833
Him or me, Dad!

13:14.834 --> 13:17.002
It's for the greater
good, Louise.

13:17.003 --> 13:18.837
Okay. I see. All right.
(coughing)

13:18.838 --> 13:20.339
Oh, thank God.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.474
I quit!

13:22.475 --> 13:24.176
Damn it, I thought
the glass would break.

13:24.177 --> 13:25.477
Anyway, I quit!

13:25.478 --> 13:27.265
The glass didn't break.
High five!

13:27.943 --> 13:29.682
Great, Bobby.
Great job!

13:29.683 --> 13:30.716
So Louise can quit?

13:30.717 --> 13:32.150
Quitting is an option?
I want to quit.

13:32.151 --> 13:33.752
It would be fun
to quit if I didn't

13:33.753 --> 13:35.320
love this job
so gosh darn much.

13:35.321 --> 13:37.089
Nobody's quitting.
Louise didn't quit.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.557
She's just going
on a sabbatical.

13:38.558 --> 13:40.158
Great. I'll do that.

13:40.159 --> 13:41.927
No, only one sabbatical
a year, Gene.

13:41.928 --> 13:43.662
And I'm taking
mine next.
Mm.

13:43.663 --> 13:46.665
This is not a big deal.
I'm gonna go talk to Louise.

13:46.666 --> 13:49.134
Louise? Sweetheart?

13:49.135 --> 13:51.236
Sweet Pea?

13:51.271 --> 13:53.739
I know I don't call you that,
but maybe we should

13:53.740 --> 13:55.674
start calling you that.
I'll do that.

13:55.675 --> 13:57.776
Sweet Pea, how you doing in there?
LOUISE: Perfect!

13:57.777 --> 13:59.411
Louise, making Logan
employee of the month

13:59.412 --> 14:01.246
doesn't mean anything.

14:01.281 --> 14:03.882
I know it doesn't, because
we've never done it before.

14:03.916 --> 14:06.018
Hey, I have a great idea.
What if we make you

14:06.019 --> 14:07.419
employee of the month
next month?

14:07.420 --> 14:08.954
I mean, Tina, technically should

14:08.955 --> 14:11.123
really be next; She works
so much harder than you.

14:11.124 --> 14:12.824
Never mind. We'll make
an exception for you.

14:12.825 --> 14:14.259
But Tina will be crushed.

14:14.294 --> 14:17.162
Sounds super, super great!
Can't wait, Dad!

14:17.196 --> 14:20.332
Okay, good.
So, good talk, right?

14:20.333 --> 14:22.034
Aw, the best.
Good first step.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.936
(groans)
Uh, thanks for participating.

14:23.937 --> 14:25.270
Love you... Cutie Pie?

14:25.271 --> 14:26.705
Ugh.
Sorry.

14:26.706 --> 14:28.640
I'll think of a better one
than Cutie Pie.

14:28.641 --> 14:30.275
You're my Angel Dust.

14:30.276 --> 14:31.543
Sorry, that's a drug.

14:31.544 --> 14:33.378
I'm gonna go. Bye.

14:33.379 --> 14:35.681
Louise. When are
you coming down?

14:35.682 --> 14:37.349
Mom has a stain
on her apron.

14:37.383 --> 14:39.618
You're missing so much.
How'd you get this number?

14:39.652 --> 14:41.119
Mom writes it
on my leg every morning

14:41.154 --> 14:42.287
in case I get lost.

14:42.288 --> 14:44.022
Oops. I better sweep this up.

14:44.023 --> 14:45.991
Keep talking about
whatever you're talking about.

14:45.992 --> 14:47.993
It doesn't have to be about
your changing bodies,

14:47.994 --> 14:49.461
but it could be. Go.

14:49.495 --> 14:52.764
So are you coming down or what?
I miss you!

14:52.799 --> 14:54.666
Oh I'll see you soon, Gene.
(chuckles)

14:54.701 --> 14:56.301
But you won't see me.

14:56.336 --> 14:59.037
If Dad won't fire Logan,
oh, I'm gonna make Logan

14:59.038 --> 15:01.173
wish Dad would've
never hired him.

15:01.207 --> 15:02.674
Okay, bye.

15:02.675 --> 15:04.743
Oh, my God. Today was
supposed to be overcast.

15:04.744 --> 15:07.179
No, it's a beautiful day.
Shorts weather.

15:07.213 --> 15:09.114
Oh, no. No, no, no.

15:09.148 --> 15:11.617
What, Bob? I-I didn't
cover my beans.

15:11.651 --> 15:14.186
You didn't cover your beans?
It was supposed to be overcast!

15:14.220 --> 15:16.788
They're gonna die!
Aah! I got to save the beans!

15:16.823 --> 15:19.091
Go! Damn it, Bob,
you're frickin' nuts.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.226
Go! I'll be back
in five minutes!

15:22.996 --> 15:24.897
Hey Scotty. Jacob. What's up?

15:24.931 --> 15:26.331
You liking
those fries, brah?

15:26.366 --> 15:28.333
On me, my friends.

15:28.334 --> 15:29.333
I do whatever

15:29.335 --> 15:30.702
I want around here.

15:30.737 --> 15:32.971
'Cause I'm employee
of the month, so...

15:33.006 --> 15:34.840
Ow! What the...
Who did that?

15:34.841 --> 15:36.308
Hey. Damn it.

15:36.342 --> 15:38.076
(quietly):
Just spitballin' here.

15:38.077 --> 15:39.745
(laughs)

15:39.779 --> 15:41.747
Linda, I just need
one photo of him

15:41.748 --> 15:43.988
with this employee of the month
plaque in the restaurant.

15:44.017 --> 15:45.851
And maybe a few of him
taking out the trash.

15:45.852 --> 15:47.532
Eh, why don't I take out
the trash instead?

15:47.554 --> 15:49.421
Uh, bup, bup, bup, bup.
I-I'm taking the photo.

15:49.422 --> 15:50.889
Dup, dup, dup, dup.
No, you don't.

15:50.890 --> 15:52.891
Bob and I have a deal.
Deal with this, honey.

15:52.892 --> 15:54.359
Oh, my face!
Ow, my face!

15:54.394 --> 15:56.962
Okay, we're good.
You guys are good, right?

15:56.963 --> 15:59.631
(high-pitched): Thanks, Bob.
We were hot and scared.

15:59.632 --> 16:02.067
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
(high-pitched): Tell us a joke.

16:02.068 --> 16:03.902
No, I-I... I got to get back.

16:03.903 --> 16:05.771
(high-pitched):
Please? Just one?

16:05.805 --> 16:07.639
All right, just one.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.409
A kid's playing in a sandbox
and he finds a welding mask.

16:10.410 --> 16:12.711
(high-pitched laugh)

16:12.712 --> 16:15.247
No, wait, there...
that's not the end.

16:15.248 --> 16:16.815
It's more.
(high-pitched): Oh.

16:16.816 --> 16:18.917
Okay, a kid's
playing in a sandbox.

16:18.918 --> 16:20.385
(high-pitched laugh)

16:20.420 --> 16:22.387
Who's hitting me
with spitballs?!

16:22.388 --> 16:24.890
(gasps) Invisible
spitball ninja.

16:24.891 --> 16:27.759
Logan, you got something
on your face right there.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.928
(grunts) Stop it!
Oh, and also right there.

16:29.929 --> 16:31.630
LOGAN:
Louise, I know it's you.

16:31.664 --> 16:32.998
Where are you?

16:32.999 --> 16:34.299
LOUISE: I'm in
your mind, Logan.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.968
There's a lot of
room in here.

16:35.969 --> 16:37.769
(chuckles)
Oh, I'm gonna find you.

16:37.770 --> 16:39.071
And I'm gonna get you.

16:39.072 --> 16:40.506
And I'm gonna...
(gags, coughs)

16:40.507 --> 16:41.912
My uvula!

16:41.941 --> 16:43.575
Employee of the mouth!

16:43.610 --> 16:44.609
(grunts)

16:44.611 --> 16:47.079
Linda, control
your daughter!

16:47.080 --> 16:48.780
Ow! Hey!
Ha, ha.

16:48.781 --> 16:51.183
Good news. The green beans
are doing all right.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.484
Oh, you and that garden.

16:52.485 --> 16:54.019
You smell like dirt
and fresh air.

16:54.020 --> 16:55.921
And it makes me sick!
Ow!

16:55.955 --> 16:57.623
Your daughter's gone nuts,
by the way.

16:57.624 --> 16:59.925
She's in the crawlspace
shooting spitballs at everybody.

16:59.926 --> 17:01.827
Louise, get out of there.
LOUISE: No!

17:01.861 --> 17:03.228
Not until you fire Logan.

17:03.263 --> 17:04.530
Ow! Hey.

17:04.531 --> 17:06.265
Louise, you come out of there
right now.

17:06.299 --> 17:08.300
I don't want to do this,
but you're not gonna be the next

17:08.300 --> 17:10.769
employee of the month;
You're gonna be the last

17:10.770 --> 17:12.971
employee of the month,
even after Gene! Sorry, Gene.

17:12.972 --> 17:14.807
Sorry for what?
I wasn't listening.

17:14.808 --> 17:17.443
And I'm not gonna fire Logan;
I'm keeping the garden,

17:17.444 --> 17:19.178
and you're gonna
deal with it, Louise,

17:19.212 --> 17:21.180
because it's good for all of us.

17:21.181 --> 17:22.881
And not to bring up
the zester again,

17:22.882 --> 17:24.817
but the zester. You owe me.

17:24.818 --> 17:26.285
And let me tell you something.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.487
Spending time in the garden
has helped me

17:28.521 --> 17:30.656
realize a few things.
We need to go

17:30.690 --> 17:32.324
outside more, okay?

17:32.325 --> 17:34.860
Why don't we go on walks?
As a whole society?

17:34.894 --> 17:36.428
People should
go out on walks!

17:36.463 --> 17:38.130
And people should garden!

17:38.131 --> 17:40.232
Bob? I hate
to interrupt your flow.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.034
Great speech though,
great speech.

17:42.035 --> 17:43.635
Yeah, it really
got going after a while.

17:43.670 --> 17:45.003
Uh, Dad?
Yes?

17:45.038 --> 17:46.338
We're not going on walks,
are we?

17:46.372 --> 17:48.207
I don't know. Maybe.
Anyway,

17:48.208 --> 17:50.075
while you were talking
to the wall, Louise snuck in

17:50.076 --> 17:51.810
and took off
with your gardening shears.

17:51.845 --> 17:54.346
What? Yeah. She looked
ready to use them, too.

17:54.347 --> 17:55.748
I wonder on what.

17:55.749 --> 17:58.050
What could it beans?

17:58.051 --> 18:00.252
Oh, my God, my garden!

18:01.616 --> 18:04.342
Louise, just stop, okay?
I get it, you're mad.

18:04.343 --> 18:05.843
Also, I'm getting a cramp.

18:05.844 --> 18:08.146
Oh, no! Better stop
and stretch it out!

18:08.180 --> 18:10.215
Louise, you're literally
running with scissors.

18:10.216 --> 18:11.583
Really big scissors.

18:11.617 --> 18:13.318
I know, it feels great!

18:13.352 --> 18:15.153
(panting)

18:15.187 --> 18:16.186
(fence rattles)

18:16.188 --> 18:17.488
Oh, good, it's closed.

18:17.489 --> 18:18.723
Louise, it's over!

18:18.724 --> 18:19.991
Come on, let's go home.

18:19.992 --> 18:21.159
(grunts)

18:21.193 --> 18:22.227
Oh, crap.

18:23.362 --> 18:24.696
(grunts)

18:24.697 --> 18:26.898
Ow. God, how small are you?

18:26.899 --> 18:28.866
Say good-bye
to your crappy crops.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.335
Ha! Don't have to.

18:30.336 --> 18:32.136
You don't know which plot
is mine, Louise.

18:32.171 --> 18:34.072
Is it the one
with the paper plate sign

18:34.073 --> 18:35.707
that says Bob's Beauties?

18:35.708 --> 18:37.375
No.

18:37.376 --> 18:40.144
No, no, no, no. You... Louise,
you don't have to do this!

18:40.179 --> 18:42.847
You didn't
have to hire Logan either.

18:42.882 --> 18:44.782
Louise, please.
Those are my babies.

18:44.817 --> 18:47.719
What? These.
These are your babies?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.821
Yes. Those are... Oh.

18:49.855 --> 18:51.990
Yeah.
Why did I... say that

18:51.991 --> 18:53.658
in front of my actual baby?

18:53.659 --> 18:54.726
Yeah!

18:54.760 --> 18:57.228
Right. Yeah, so maybe this whole

18:57.229 --> 19:00.164
garden thing
was a little selfish.

19:00.199 --> 19:01.866
Yeah, I noticed
how the greater good

19:01.867 --> 19:04.002
meant doing the thing
you like to do.

19:04.003 --> 19:05.837
You're right.
You know what?

19:05.838 --> 19:08.006
Do it. Cut them.
Cut them down.

19:08.007 --> 19:09.774
What? Really?
Yeah, do it.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.543
I deserve it.
I can't watch.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.948
I can't. It's not their fault.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.516
That's right.
It's my fault.

19:18.517 --> 19:20.018
So I'm gonna cut you.
What?

19:20.019 --> 19:21.019
Just kidding.

19:21.020 --> 19:22.820
(chuckles)
I know.

19:22.855 --> 19:24.289
Look, I'm sorry I hired Logan.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.057
I-I know how much
you don't like him.

19:26.091 --> 19:27.859
Yeah, I'm pretty open
about that, Dad.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.395
Plus, I mean,
the restaurant is our place.

19:30.396 --> 19:31.930
And I like it that way.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.531
I know you do. I mean,

19:33.566 --> 19:35.233
sort of.
I had a suspicion.

19:35.234 --> 19:36.768
But you do
hide it pretty well.

19:36.769 --> 19:38.803
Thank you. I'm sorry
I put my sweet peas

19:38.804 --> 19:40.705
before my Sweet Pea.

19:40.706 --> 19:43.641
Is that nickname thing
working at all now? No.

19:43.642 --> 19:45.276
Can you
forgive me anyway?

19:45.311 --> 19:47.378
Under one condition.

19:47.379 --> 19:49.080
You're fired!
What?

19:49.081 --> 19:50.748
She can't fire me.
Right?

19:50.749 --> 19:52.083
Of course she can't.

19:52.084 --> 19:53.718
Yeah, I think she just did.

19:53.719 --> 19:55.954
Louise is actually our
human resources person now.

19:55.955 --> 19:58.456
And I'm executive
vice president of new business!

19:58.457 --> 20:00.592
Oh, man, I've just
been bussing tables.

20:00.626 --> 20:02.894
Logan, if you need
a recommendation, here's one:

20:02.895 --> 20:04.395
Put a bag on your face.

20:04.396 --> 20:06.231
I'll put a bag
on your face.

20:06.265 --> 20:08.333
Okay, hon, I'm gonna have
security walk you out now.

20:08.334 --> 20:09.901
No.
Well, I hope you enjoyed

20:09.902 --> 20:11.669
your last trip
to the garden, Bob.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.504
Because it was
your last trip.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.507
I know. That's why I dug up all
my plants and brought them home.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.076
And I used your wheelbarrow.
My...

20:18.077 --> 20:19.277
You're not allowed
to use that.

20:19.278 --> 20:20.512
It already happened.

20:20.513 --> 20:21.779
There's nothing
you can do about it.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.481
And I broke
the lock on your gate.

20:23.482 --> 20:25.083
(gasps)
Which I will replace.

20:25.084 --> 20:27.151
Which is what you should do
with your eggplant.

20:27.152 --> 20:28.920
It looks leggy.

20:28.921 --> 20:30.788
Logan, let's go.
You're all nuts.

20:30.789 --> 20:32.257
Uh-huh, so if you want
to shoot me your e-mail,

20:32.258 --> 20:34.792
I can just send you the rest
of my boy questions.

20:34.793 --> 20:36.027
Absolutely not.

20:36.028 --> 20:38.162
"Absolutely not"
at what .com?

20:38.197 --> 20:39.497
Bye, Cynthia.

20:39.498 --> 20:41.199
I spilled water
on your laptop.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.735
Aw, she didn't hear me.
She'll figure it out.

20:45.642 --> 20:47.076
Looking a little cramped.

20:47.077 --> 20:48.778
Yeah, we probably should've
just planted one.

20:48.779 --> 20:50.942
Oh, no!
Oh, God!
