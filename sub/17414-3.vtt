WEBVTT

00:06.106 --> 00:07.241
Let's jump right in.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.142
Who would like to help
me dissect the branches

00:09.210 --> 00:11.110
of the femoral artery?

00:11.178 --> 00:12.575
Anyone?

00:12.643 --> 00:14.049
No one?

00:14.117 --> 00:16.210
Fine.

00:16.279 --> 00:18.359
How about, uh, Mr. Woodcomb?

00:18.426 --> 00:20.060
Devon?

00:20.127 --> 00:22.284
Devon?

00:22.352 --> 00:24.240
Seems Devon has more pressing concerns

00:24.308 --> 00:26.528
on his first day of medical school.

00:26.596 --> 00:29.556
So perhaps, uh, Ms. Eleanor Bartowski

00:29.623 --> 00:32.146
would like to give me a hand, hmm?

00:33.789 --> 00:37.717
Well, wherever Mr. Woodcomb
and Ms. Bartowski are,

00:37.785 --> 00:40.970
I hope they're gaining an
appreciation of the human body.

00:46.704 --> 00:49.222
What did you say your name was? Devon.

00:49.290 --> 00:50.662
Yours? Ellie.

00:50.730 --> 00:52.640
Pleasure to meet you, Ellie.

00:54.349 --> 00:55.780
You know, I don't normally
make out with strangers

00:55.848 --> 00:57.081
in broom closets like this.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.167
We're not strangers.

01:00.235 --> 01:01.339
Remember?

01:01.407 --> 01:03.282
I'm Devon, you're Ellie.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.779
Oh, God, I love med school.

01:13.848 --> 01:15.954
Broom! Broom! Broom!

01:16.959 --> 01:19.136
Have you seen the broom?

01:19.204 --> 01:20.740
Can you forget about the TV?

01:20.808 --> 01:22.646
I just broke another one of
our wedding plates.

01:22.714 --> 01:23.916
I can do this.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.555
I just have to channel my inner Chuck.

01:25.623 --> 01:26.725
Chuck who?

01:26.793 --> 01:28.764
That person's dead to me.

01:28.832 --> 01:30.136
Relax, babe, I have nine years

01:30.204 --> 01:31.673
of post-graduate education.

01:31.741 --> 01:33.812
I can figure out a stupid TV set.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.217
You know, he said
he  was gonna help us move.

01:35.285 --> 01:36.253
No excuses.

01:36.321 --> 01:38.024
Well, honey, you remember how it is.

01:38.093 --> 01:39.929
He's young, fancy-free.

01:39.996 --> 01:42.804
Probably just slipped his mind.

01:45.312 --> 01:46.246
Honey,

01:46.314 --> 01:47.683
look at this.

01:47.751 --> 01:49.855
This is our wedding album.

01:49.923 --> 01:51.960
Is it just me or does this

01:52.028 --> 01:53.731
feel like a million years ago?

01:55.604 --> 01:58.577
What happened to us?

01:58.645 --> 02:01.284
Well, we moved.

02:01.352 --> 02:03.255
We went back to work.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.591
Real life happened.

02:04.659 --> 02:07.632
Well, when do we get to
take a break from real life?

02:07.699 --> 02:10.838
When do we get to be these people again?

02:10.906 --> 02:14.213
Okay, here's the deal.

02:14.281 --> 02:16.485
Enough moving for one night.

02:16.552 --> 02:18.656
I'm gonna get us some real food,

02:18.724 --> 02:19.892
we're gonna sit on this couch

02:19.959 --> 02:21.429
and we're gonna watch
our wedding video.

02:21.497 --> 02:23.533
And then maybe later

02:23.601 --> 02:25.470
we can recreate our wedding night.

02:28.010 --> 02:30.013
What about the TV?

02:31.784 --> 02:33.854
That's a job for a professional.

02:35.225 --> 02:36.360
Is it just me or has there been

02:36.428 --> 02:38.497
like a lot of helicopters lately?

02:38.565 --> 02:40.868
Hmm.

02:40.936 --> 02:42.839
Hadn't noticed.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.887
Sorry, dude.

02:50.955 --> 02:52.157
Didn't mean to scare you.

02:52.225 --> 02:54.629
Really?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.299
Well, then maybe you shouldn't be

02:56.367 --> 02:58.838
sneaking into my room
in the middle of the night.

02:58.905 --> 03:00.241
Well, then maybe you
should tell your pilot

03:00.309 --> 03:01.577
to land a little farther
from the apartment.

03:01.644 --> 03:04.113
Oh, right.

03:04.181 --> 03:05.282
Sorry about that.

03:05.350 --> 03:06.885
The thing is,

03:06.953 --> 03:10.626
he doesn't really know
the Echo Park area all that well.

03:10.694 --> 03:13.866
But, uh, we'll work on that.

03:13.934 --> 03:15.135
Hey, can you, uh, do me a favor

03:15.203 --> 03:16.771
and help me get out of
this thing right here?

03:16.839 --> 03:17.939
Just pull down on the...

03:18.007 --> 03:19.775
Where were you tonight?

03:19.843 --> 03:21.744
You told Ellie that you were
gonna help us out with the TV.

03:21.811 --> 03:23.546
She's a little pissed, bro.

03:23.614 --> 03:26.252
Oh, man, my bad.

03:26.319 --> 03:28.322
I had a, uh, CIA mission.

03:28.389 --> 03:30.392
What exactly does that mean?

03:30.460 --> 03:33.297
Well, you know, same old, same old.

03:33.364 --> 03:34.999
Bad guy throws a fancy cocktail party.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.168
Another bad guy's

03:36.236 --> 03:37.504
trying to sell him a weapon.

03:37.571 --> 03:39.374
We bust both bad guys, diffuse a bomb.

03:39.441 --> 03:41.610
Blah, blah, blah.

03:41.678 --> 03:43.914
That sounds kind of kickass.

03:43.982 --> 03:45.984
What do you got under there?

03:46.052 --> 03:47.320
Body armor.

03:47.388 --> 03:50.124
You might want to leave that on
when you come over.

03:50.192 --> 03:52.060
Like I said,
your sister's about to blow.

03:54.532 --> 03:55.800
All right.

03:55.868 --> 03:59.105
Chuck, you could've been
a surgeon with those hands.

03:59.173 --> 04:00.275
He could've been a lot of things.

04:00.343 --> 04:01.543
I would settle for being on time.

04:04.749 --> 04:06.484
That should do it.

04:06.552 --> 04:08.052
Try it now.

04:09.121 --> 04:11.055
It has been reported,

04:11.123 --> 04:13.123
Premier Alejandro Goya
collapsed shortly after...

04:13.191 --> 04:14.824
Oh, oh, look at that.

04:14.892 --> 04:16.591
I take it back, you're a genius.

04:16.660 --> 04:17.927
I'm gonna get the wedding DVD.

04:17.994 --> 04:19.995
This visit to the US is the first

04:20.063 --> 04:22.698
for the outspoken Costa Gravan leader.

04:22.766 --> 04:24.633
Goya has ruled his small nation

04:24.701 --> 04:28.403
ever since a Communist coup in 1974.

04:37.245 --> 04:39.745
Speaking of collapsing, Chuck, you okay?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.242
Huh, what?

04:42.310 --> 04:44.176
Yes, yeah.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.741
I'm fine; I'm a little light-headed.

04:45.808 --> 04:47.342
That's all.

04:49.911 --> 04:50.977
I gotta run.

04:51.045 --> 04:52.745
What is it? Another mission?

04:52.813 --> 04:53.880
Huh, something with premier?

04:53.948 --> 04:55.283
You know, I'm sorry, buddy,

04:55.351 --> 04:57.318
it's spy stuff; it's confidential.

05:01.621 --> 05:02.888
Where are you going?

05:02.956 --> 05:04.989
Sorry, buddy, doctor stuff.

05:05.057 --> 05:06.523
Confidential. Hmm.

05:06.591 --> 05:08.258
Hey!

05:08.326 --> 05:10.728
What happened to recreating
our wedding night?

05:10.796 --> 05:12.231
Sorry, babe. Duty calls.

05:12.298 --> 05:14.566
I will make it up to you, I promise.

05:18.503 --> 05:21.604
The Costa Gravan premier is
listed in critical condition.

05:21.672 --> 05:23.906
Outstanding.
Want me to crack the bubbly?

05:23.974 --> 05:26.075
No. I want you to go to the hospital

05:26.142 --> 05:28.043
and guard against further
threats to his life,

05:28.111 --> 05:29.177
natural or otherwise.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.845
But haven't you personally

05:30.913 --> 05:33.281
given me the order to
kill that commie crackpot

05:33.348 --> 05:34.749
on three separate occasions?

05:34.816 --> 05:38.185
And three times,
you have failed to complete your orders.

05:38.253 --> 05:39.786
I thought you said you
had a perfect record.

05:41.822 --> 05:44.223
Wow. This is getting
entertainingly uncomfortable.

05:44.291 --> 05:46.558
Our relations with Costa Gravas
have changed, Colonel.

05:46.626 --> 05:50.061
The premier is here to announce
plans to open his nation up

05:50.129 --> 05:51.396
to democratic elections.

05:51.463 --> 05:52.663
Oh, and you believe that?

05:52.731 --> 05:54.198
Our duty is to stop anyone

05:54.266 --> 05:56.700
who would stop him from
going through with his plan.

05:56.768 --> 05:57.868
Understood?

05:57.936 --> 05:58.586
Yes, ma'am.

05:58.587 --> 06:01.104
So, we're assuming this was
an assassination attempt?

06:01.171 --> 06:02.305
We're not assuming anything

06:02.372 --> 06:03.773
until we've secured his medical records.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.240
That brings me to your assignment.

06:05.308 --> 06:08.243
The premier is being treated at...

06:08.311 --> 06:09.511
Let me guess.

06:09.578 --> 06:10.712
Westside Medical?

06:10.779 --> 06:11.913
Correct.

06:27.693 --> 06:29.727
Everybody relax. The doctor's here.

06:29.795 --> 06:32.629
<i>General, are you
suggesting that I exploit</i>

06:32.697 --> 06:34.097
my sister and/or brother-in-law

06:34.165 --> 06:37.333
to acquire confidential medical
records for governmental use?

06:37.400 --> 06:40.135
Yes, Chuck, that's exactly
what I'm suggesting.

06:40.203 --> 06:41.469
I knew it. I was on...

06:41.537 --> 06:43.137
Wait. Hold on a second, General.

06:43.205 --> 06:44.639
If anything happens to the Premier,

06:44.707 --> 06:46.874
I'm holding you responsible.

06:50.178 --> 06:51.979
If anything happens to this man,

06:52.046 --> 06:55.414
I'm holding you responsible.

07:32.712 --> 07:34.080
In a miraculous turn of events,

07:34.147 --> 07:37.682
the Costa Gravan premier is
being released from the hospital

07:37.750 --> 07:40.317
just hours after being
rushed to the emergency room.

07:40.385 --> 07:42.152
Right now, we go to Westside Medical

07:42.220 --> 07:44.021
for a live press conference.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.855
Dr. Woodcomb? Dr. Woodcomb?

07:45.923 --> 07:48.457
It was reported that the premier
suffered heart failure.

07:48.525 --> 07:50.025
How do you account for
his amazing recovery?

07:50.093 --> 07:51.460
I can only say this.

07:51.528 --> 07:54.196
The premier is an amazing man, a real fighter.

07:54.264 --> 07:55.297
I'm gonna be sick.

07:55.365 --> 07:56.498
Dr. Woodcomb? Dr. Woodcomb?

07:59.468 --> 08:02.570
What is the probability of
the premier returning to work?

08:02.638 --> 08:04.539
<i>Hmm. Las probabilidades</i>

08:04.606 --> 08:06.640
<i>de que se reincorporan al trabajo</i>

08:06.708 --> 08:08.342
<i>es muy awesome.</i>

08:08.409 --> 08:11.011
Is there anything your
brother-in-law can't do?

08:11.079 --> 08:13.213
Well, thus the nickname.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.381
Okay, enough sitting around.

08:15.449 --> 08:16.815
We need to figure out
what really happened

08:16.883 --> 08:18.083
to the premier.

08:18.151 --> 08:19.251
Let's go apprehend the good doctor,

08:19.318 --> 08:20.485
get those medical records out of him.

08:20.553 --> 08:22.853
Nobody is apprehending anybody.

08:22.921 --> 08:24.253
He's family. I can talk to him.

08:24.321 --> 08:27.090
Just remember, Chuck,
he's a civilian, so be cool.

08:27.157 --> 08:29.058
Hello.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.265
Sorry, bro. Didn't mean to scare you.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.067
You didn't.

08:40.135 --> 08:42.702
I didn't?

08:42.769 --> 08:44.736
Whatever.

08:44.804 --> 08:49.340
Listen, there's a few questions
I need to ask you.

08:49.407 --> 08:51.408
It's about the premier, right?

08:52.744 --> 08:56.213
Sure you want to talk
about this here, hmm?

08:56.281 --> 08:59.015
Doesn't the CIA want to
debrief me or something?

08:59.083 --> 09:01.217
I am debriefing you.

09:01.285 --> 09:02.618
That's what I'm doing

09:02.686 --> 09:04.253
right now. This is a debriefing.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.854
I mean, in your secret base.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.424
Secret... You've
watched too many movies.

09:07.492 --> 09:09.726
Just tell me what you
know about the premier.

09:09.794 --> 09:13.029
Well, I know he didn't
really have a heart attack.

09:13.097 --> 09:15.031
His potassium level was off the charts.

09:15.099 --> 09:16.855
I don't know how it
got into his system...

09:16.856 --> 09:17.733
So he was poisoned.

09:17.801 --> 09:19.968
Okay, that's all I needed
to know. Thanks.

09:20.036 --> 09:23.771
Whoa, Chuck, you know,
if there's anything else I can do?

09:23.839 --> 09:25.439
No. You've been great.

09:25.507 --> 09:26.974
No. Seriously.

09:27.042 --> 09:29.910
If the CIA needs an
extra set of hands...

09:29.977 --> 09:31.911
Good to know.

09:31.979 --> 09:33.412
Chuck, you're not hearing me.

09:33.479 --> 09:35.447
Okay? Nothing against married life,

09:35.514 --> 09:37.484
but I could use some real excitement.

09:37.552 --> 09:40.888
Devon, you're an adventure
sports cardiologist.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.424
Whatever, man.
I can do that in my sleep.

09:43.491 --> 09:45.125
You know, I need some real action.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.426
Some real adrenaline.

09:46.494 --> 09:49.362
I want to feel like I felt out
on the football field, dude.

09:49.430 --> 09:50.930
You know, I can still
run a four-four-40.

09:50.931 --> 09:52.865
Great. If we ever need a tight-end,

09:52.933 --> 09:54.467
you're the first call
I'm making, but until then,

09:54.534 --> 09:56.235
you're my brother-in-law. Ellie...

09:56.302 --> 09:58.170
would kill me.

09:58.237 --> 10:01.906
<i>Thanks to your brother-in-law's
intelligence, we have to assume</i>

10:01.974 --> 10:04.274
<i>that the assassin is still in play.</i>

10:04.342 --> 10:06.642
There's an event at the
Costa Gravan Consulate this evening.

10:06.710 --> 10:09.077
I need your team there
to guard the premier.

10:09.145 --> 10:10.711
You want us to break in?

10:10.779 --> 10:12.046
Technically, that's
invading sovereign soil.

10:12.113 --> 10:13.614
That is why the CIA

10:13.681 --> 10:15.748
has no official
knowledge of this mission.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.650
Uh, just spit-balling here, General.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.485
Why don't we just tell the premier

10:19.553 --> 10:20.854
that his life is in danger?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.021
Would you trust a country

10:22.089 --> 10:23.322
that spent the better part

10:23.390 --> 10:25.124
of three decades trying to kill you?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.425
Hmm. Yeah.

10:26.493 --> 10:29.161
Your protection must go undetected.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.030
What? So, that... that's... that's it?

10:33.098 --> 10:35.465
If we get busted,
then the CIA disavows us,

10:35.533 --> 10:37.100
and then we rot for
the rest of our lives

10:37.168 --> 10:39.302
in a Costa Gravan prison?

10:39.369 --> 10:40.469
In Costa Gravas, the punishment

10:40.537 --> 10:41.770
for sedition is death by firing squad.

10:41.838 --> 10:43.538
Just my kind of mission.

10:43.606 --> 10:44.973
Too bad I have to recuse myself.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.742
What? He's bailing?
You're bailing on us?

10:47.810 --> 10:50.744
I can't show my face on
Costa Gravan soil, I'm a wanted man.

10:50.812 --> 10:53.013
You know what they'd do if they knew

10:53.081 --> 10:55.048
I was in Los Angeles?

10:55.116 --> 10:57.583
I spilled more blood than
that Mickey Mouse revolution

10:57.651 --> 10:59.018
than any other...

11:00.452 --> 11:01.886
Don't you think you're
being a little paranoid?

11:01.954 --> 11:05.156
They call me "El Angel de la Muerte".

11:05.223 --> 11:06.535
The "Angel of Death".

11:06.536 --> 11:08.859
Please. Bro, it was the '80s.

11:08.927 --> 11:09.893
Come on.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.194
You really think the premier

11:11.262 --> 11:12.695
gives a flying crap about you,

11:12.763 --> 11:13.796
John Casey?

11:13.864 --> 11:16.198
Oh, no! It's the "Angel of Death"!

11:17.300 --> 11:18.533
Hmm.

11:22.638 --> 11:23.738
Casey, those aren't...

11:23.806 --> 11:25.206
Oh, boy!

11:25.274 --> 11:26.440
Oh.

11:26.508 --> 11:28.575
At last, they've come for me.

11:33.447 --> 11:35.314
Can take a few of these commies with me.

11:35.382 --> 11:36.515
Ready?

11:39.518 --> 11:40.885
No, no, not ready.
You wait just one second.

11:40.953 --> 11:41.919
They are not here

11:41.987 --> 11:43.921
for you, Casey. They're here for...

11:43.988 --> 11:45.055
Huh?

11:46.457 --> 11:47.891
Devon?

11:47.959 --> 11:49.492
Kind of in the middle
of something, babe.

11:51.595 --> 11:54.697
Baby, I've been on call
for three straight days.

11:54.765 --> 11:56.532
I know, hon. And I haven't

11:56.599 --> 11:58.366
worked out since we moved in.

11:58.434 --> 12:00.068
Gotta keep my heart rate in the red.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.069
Don't open the door.

12:02.137 --> 12:03.404
Okay.

12:03.471 --> 12:05.405
Okay.

12:05.473 --> 12:06.573
Pick up the phone.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.941
Pick up the phone.

12:10.010 --> 12:12.010
You've got to be kidding me.

12:16.315 --> 12:18.249
Make it stop.

12:18.316 --> 12:20.250
Make it stop. Okay.

12:20.318 --> 12:22.485
I got it, babe.

12:28.725 --> 12:31.259
Dr. Woodcomb?

12:31.327 --> 12:34.295
Um... yeah?

12:34.363 --> 12:35.763
Dr. Devon Woodcomb?

12:36.799 --> 12:38.299
That's me.

12:38.367 --> 12:39.834
Do you have any idea what you've done,

12:39.902 --> 12:41.903
Dr. Devon Woodcomb?

12:44.172 --> 12:46.606
You saved my life.

12:50.344 --> 12:51.944
How can I ever hope to repay you?

12:53.513 --> 12:56.281
Okay, how about we just keep it down?

12:56.349 --> 12:58.183
Devon, who are these people?

12:58.250 --> 13:00.151
Alejandro Fulgencio Goya.

13:00.218 --> 13:02.486
I am the master of parliament,

13:02.554 --> 13:04.454
Chief Military Officer Ofosta Gravas.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.157
I am at your most humble service.

13:07.224 --> 13:08.299
What is going on?

13:08.300 --> 13:10.526
You must be
Señora Woodcomb, hmm?

13:10.594 --> 13:12.461
Actually, I'm a doctor, too.

13:12.529 --> 13:14.262
All right, stay put.

13:14.330 --> 13:15.463
I'm going in.

13:15.531 --> 13:17.465
You're a doctor?

13:17.533 --> 13:20.301
I didn't think such beauty still exists.

13:20.369 --> 13:22.770
Not from beyond the shores
of Costa Gravas, huh?

13:22.838 --> 13:25.338
Well, it's nice to meet you.

13:25.406 --> 13:27.440
How do you know Devon exactly?
You don't know?

13:27.508 --> 13:30.576
I was going to tell you
when you woke up, honey.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.777
Ah, such modesty!

13:31.845 --> 13:34.946
Your husband's a hero.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.315
<i>Saluden el hombre!</i>

13:38.317 --> 13:41.284
I owe him my life.

13:41.352 --> 13:44.254
There is a gala this
evening at my consulate.

13:44.322 --> 13:46.856
You will be both be my guests of honor.

13:46.924 --> 13:48.391
I will be humbled.

13:52.696 --> 13:54.763
He's waiting for you to say yes.

13:54.831 --> 13:56.598
<i>Oh. Yes.</i>

13:56.665 --> 13:58.499
Splendwill see you tonight, then.

13:59.934 --> 14:01.168
Hey, somebody say
something about a gala?

14:02.637 --> 14:04.320
Hi. Sorry. Easy there.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.073
Uh, sir, this is my brother Chuck.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.007
He's your brother?

14:08.809 --> 14:09.976
<i>Quieto.</i>

14:10.043 --> 14:11.977
Ah.

14:12.045 --> 14:13.912
The resemblance, I see.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.531
Your family has such
delicate features, huh?

14:16.532 --> 14:17.382
Thank you.

14:17.450 --> 14:19.684
Much more suitable on
a woman, though, no?

14:19.752 --> 14:21.085
Fair enough.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.619
If he's half the man you are,

14:22.687 --> 14:24.654
you bring him as well, huh?

14:25.722 --> 14:28.557
A military escort will be here at 7:00.

14:30.493 --> 14:32.927
<i>¡Vamonos!</i>

14:38.065 --> 14:39.932
Yes! I can't believe this is happening.

14:39.999 --> 14:40.999
Wow!

14:48.506 --> 14:50.373
I can't believe this is happening.

14:50.441 --> 14:52.375
I spent a year on secret service detail.

14:52.442 --> 14:55.577
I'm sure I can protect
one small time dictator.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.713
The dictator's not who
I'm worried about, though.

14:59.748 --> 15:02.283
Is this romantic enough for you?

15:02.351 --> 15:04.352
Devon, it's perfect.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.624
Look.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.392
I know you're nervous,

15:12.459 --> 15:13.559
but I also know how the Intersect works

15:13.627 --> 15:14.560
when you get nervous.

15:14.628 --> 15:15.594
And if you really want to protect them,

15:15.662 --> 15:17.663
you're going to have to focus.

15:22.334 --> 15:24.768
Casey, I got guards
with submachine guns

15:24.836 --> 15:26.936
at both the north and west exits.

15:27.004 --> 15:28.071
<i>Yeah, copy that.</i>

15:28.138 --> 15:30.472
Main doors have hidden metal detectors.

15:30.540 --> 15:32.540
Someone should go around back,
check the service entrance.

15:32.608 --> 15:35.209
I'll go check on the premier.
Rendez vous in five.

15:35.277 --> 15:38.113
Chuck, keep a lookout for
any potential assassins.

15:53.895 --> 15:55.829
So, what's the plan, bro?

15:55.897 --> 15:58.331
CIA going to whack the premier?

15:58.399 --> 16:00.733
Nobody is going to be
whacking anybody, okay?

16:00.801 --> 16:01.768
That's why we're here.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.769
Ah, I get it.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.771
We're on the counteroffensive.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.972
What's my mission?

16:07.040 --> 16:08.908
Your mission?

16:08.975 --> 16:10.242
Your miss... Oh, hold on a second.

16:10.310 --> 16:11.276
It's Langley.

16:11.344 --> 16:13.145
What are they telling me? Oh!

16:13.213 --> 16:15.147
They want you to stop
screwing around, okay?

16:15.215 --> 16:17.316
They want you to keep
my sister out of danger.

16:17.384 --> 16:19.151
They want you not to take
your eyes off her all night.

16:19.219 --> 16:20.186
Think you you can handle that, 007?

16:20.253 --> 16:22.021
Uh, Chuck...

16:26.860 --> 16:29.295
I can't take my eyes off of you.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.830
You must stay next to me all night long

16:30.898 --> 16:33.232
and whatever comes after.

16:36.503 --> 16:37.770
My wife is talking

16:37.837 --> 16:40.004
to the target of an assassination plot.

16:40.072 --> 16:41.372
We gotta get her out of there.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.840
I'm going in.

16:42.907 --> 16:44.174
Awesome, calm down.

16:44.242 --> 16:47.276
Let the professional handle this.

16:48.345 --> 16:49.845
I hope I'm not interrupting.

16:49.913 --> 16:50.846
No.

16:50.914 --> 16:54.217
No. Sarah, this is, uh, the premier.

16:54.284 --> 16:55.451
Call me Generalissimo.

16:55.519 --> 16:56.652
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.953
You know, I have to say

16:58.021 --> 17:00.956
my doctor tells me to avoid this,
uh, stimulation.

17:01.023 --> 17:03.224
But then again,
my doctor is your husband.

17:06.127 --> 17:09.068
Well, I'm, I'm so sorry,
but I need to borrow her

17:09.136 --> 17:10.537
for a second, Generalissimo.

17:10.604 --> 17:12.040
Girl talk.

17:13.041 --> 17:13.942
She's good.

17:14.010 --> 17:15.443
The best.

17:16.779 --> 17:18.346
Thank God you rescued me.

17:18.414 --> 17:20.381
That guy's cologne
was practically a WMD.

17:21.750 --> 17:25.285
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

17:26.887 --> 17:28.655
Ugh.

17:28.722 --> 17:30.389
I'm sorry. Of course.

17:30.457 --> 17:32.424
Of course, this must be
really hard for you guys.

17:32.491 --> 17:34.426
Yeah. It is.

17:34.493 --> 17:36.160
I mean, one minute you're broken up,

17:36.228 --> 17:37.561
and then the next minute,

17:37.629 --> 17:39.496
you're on this incredibly sexy date.

17:39.564 --> 17:41.498
So, what's the deal with you guys?

17:41.565 --> 17:43.399
I mean, not to be crass or anything,

17:43.467 --> 17:46.936
but you and Sarah ever, like, you know?

17:47.003 --> 17:48.971
No.

17:49.038 --> 17:50.739
- Never?
- Nope.

17:50.806 --> 17:54.141
Huh. I always thought you guys were,
like, a real couple.

17:56.911 --> 17:59.345
Sarah, do you still have
feelings for my brother?

17:59.413 --> 18:01.347
No. No. We're...

18:01.414 --> 18:04.349
Chuck and I are just friends.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.351
Sarah, please.
Look at yourself right now.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.353
I mean, look at the dress.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.687
Look me in the eye

18:09.755 --> 18:11.822
and tell me that you
guys are just friends.

18:14.258 --> 18:18.159
Yeah, it's our job to
fool people like you.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.193
Wow.

18:19.261 --> 18:20.595
That must be hard.

18:20.662 --> 18:22.863
Not just the not-having-sex part.

18:22.931 --> 18:24.665
That must be excruciating.

18:24.732 --> 18:28.501
But having to fake like
you're in love with someone

18:28.569 --> 18:30.103
for almost three years.

18:30.170 --> 18:32.071
Especially someone like her.

18:33.506 --> 18:35.941
How do you do it, Chuck?

18:36.008 --> 18:38.009
How do you not fall for her?

18:40.781 --> 18:42.715
I don't think

18:42.783 --> 18:44.883
that you understand our situation.

18:44.951 --> 18:46.885
I understand completely.

18:46.953 --> 18:50.321
I do. You know, you go through
hot and cold patches.

18:50.389 --> 18:52.723
When Devon and I got married,
we kind of put

18:52.791 --> 18:54.457
the passion on hold, but...

18:54.525 --> 18:57.326
being here in a place
like this, it just...

18:57.394 --> 18:59.828
brings it all back, you know?

18:59.896 --> 19:02.397
It feels like it did in the beginning.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.300
All right, ladies...

19:06.367 --> 19:08.468
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
too, Bartowski.

19:08.536 --> 19:09.970
Enough with the chitchat.

19:10.039 --> 19:13.507
Let's get back to protecting our
foreign head of state, shall we?

19:14.543 --> 19:16.243
Friends,

19:16.311 --> 19:18.745
ex-patriots, countrymen...

19:18.813 --> 19:20.079
<i>Not a great of speech.</i>

19:20.147 --> 19:21.080
<i>It makes him a walking target.</i>

19:21.081 --> 19:24.048
It's so good to be here
with all of you.

19:24.116 --> 19:27.351
I see many of my
old comrades here tonight.

19:28.419 --> 19:29.919
Men who never dreamed

19:29.987 --> 19:32.588
one day we'd meet in the heart

19:32.655 --> 19:34.522
of this Capitalist beast,

19:34.590 --> 19:36.524
Los Angeles.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.667
And I see new faces
here tonight as well.

19:42.735 --> 19:45.669
Americanos, they never dreamed

19:45.737 --> 19:48.671
that one night they would
be dining and dancing

19:48.739 --> 19:50.673
in the soil of Costa Gravas!

19:50.741 --> 19:52.908
Hey!

19:52.976 --> 19:56.211
<i>Goya, Goya, Goya, Goya, Goya...</i>

19:56.278 --> 19:57.879
No, no. No, no.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.415
To symbolize this historic meeting

20:00.482 --> 20:02.450
of two great nations,

20:02.518 --> 20:04.952
I would like to invite

20:05.020 --> 20:07.120
Mrs. Dr. Woodcomb...

20:08.289 --> 20:09.422
to this dance.

20:10.591 --> 20:11.857
Oh!

20:11.925 --> 20:13.258
I... I couldn't possibly.

20:15.794 --> 20:17.028
Listen,

20:17.095 --> 20:18.062
relax.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.163
You know what they say?

20:20.264 --> 20:22.732
When in Costa Gravas...

20:25.101 --> 20:27.001
Okay.

20:54.388 --> 20:56.722
<i>Arriba!</i>

21:01.361 --> 21:03.062
I ran the guest list
against our database

21:03.129 --> 21:04.830
Got a hit. Subject entered

21:04.898 --> 21:06.064
on a stolen passport.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.999
I'm uploading you the photo right now.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.067
Huh.

21:11.135 --> 21:12.302
Charming. Who is he?

21:12.370 --> 21:15.171
Real name's Pablo Alarcon.
Freedom fighter.

21:15.239 --> 21:18.173
Guy spent 20 years in
a Costa Gravan prison

21:18.241 --> 21:20.942
for trying to overthrow
the Communist party.

21:28.416 --> 21:30.817
- Sarah...
- Okay, I see him.

21:30.885 --> 21:33.452
We need to take him out
before the guards see us.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.787
Remember, we're in Costa Gravan soil.

21:34.854 --> 21:36.054
They'll arrest us

21:36.122 --> 21:38.223
if we make a sudden
move toward the premier.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.692
We need to get across that dance floor.

21:58.441 --> 21:59.541
Chuck?

22:01.443 --> 22:03.010
Just follow my lead, huh?

22:10.950 --> 22:12.651
There he is.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.809
The assassin is behind you.

22:42.877 --> 22:43.877
Take him out.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.245
Three, two... one!

22:53.319 --> 22:55.120
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

22:58.322 --> 23:00.055
What is it? False alarm.

23:00.123 --> 23:01.856
He's just a political protester.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.157
Yeah, Casey, guess what.

23:03.225 --> 23:04.692
Your assassin was carrying

23:04.760 --> 23:06.427
nothing but a rotten egg.

23:06.495 --> 23:07.461
Take him and his date.

23:07.529 --> 23:09.096
Let them sober up in the alleyway.

23:09.164 --> 23:11.264
What? No. I'm sober, I'm sober!

23:11.332 --> 23:13.366
Listen, it's a misunderstanding, okay?

23:24.009 --> 23:25.310
Wait. No, no!

23:25.377 --> 23:26.377
You don't understand!

23:26.445 --> 23:28.046
Premier's life is in danger.

23:28.113 --> 23:29.112
I'm just a bad dancer.

23:29.180 --> 23:30.614
It was an accident.

23:30.681 --> 23:31.748
No! No!

23:31.816 --> 23:33.149
Sarah, that guy we just passed...

23:33.216 --> 23:35.050
that other guard...
He is the real assassin.

23:35.118 --> 23:35.951
What happened?

23:36.019 --> 23:36.952
Casey, do you copy?

23:37.020 --> 23:38.053
I'm out of position.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.420
The premier is completely unprotected.

23:39.488 --> 23:40.588
<i>We need you in here.</i>

23:41.657 --> 23:43.123
This way.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.272
Comrade.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.808
Doesn't it feel like anything
can happen tonight, honey?

24:24.656 --> 24:26.022
Honey. Honey?

24:38.501 --> 24:39.601
Casey?

24:48.409 --> 24:50.644
<i>El Angel de la Muerte.</i>

24:52.480 --> 24:54.347
Take him to the holding
cell in the basement.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.318
Oh, my God!

24:59.386 --> 25:00.486
Devon, what happened?

25:00.554 --> 25:02.021
I can't believe it.

25:02.088 --> 25:03.755
You saved my life.

25:03.823 --> 25:05.256
Again!

25:05.324 --> 25:07.925
You saved the general from an assassin?

25:07.993 --> 25:10.327
I can't believe you just did that.

25:10.395 --> 25:12.429
I can't believe it, either.

25:14.371 --> 25:15.138
What do you mean, wait?

25:17.206 --> 25:19.073
Look, General, I hate to interrupt

25:19.141 --> 25:20.908
your little cocktail party
you got going on there,

25:20.976 --> 25:22.442
but we got a man down here.

25:22.510 --> 25:24.110
I appreciate your loyalty.

25:24.178 --> 25:26.446
Well, then, send in the Black Ops,
storm the consulate.

25:26.513 --> 25:27.914
Costa Gravan soil will be damned.

25:27.981 --> 25:29.949
Casey was doing his job.

25:30.017 --> 25:31.350
Given Casey's history
with Costa Gravas,

25:31.418 --> 25:33.352
I mean, just imagine what
they're doing to him.

25:33.419 --> 25:36.254
We will do everything we can
to get the colonel back...

25:36.322 --> 25:38.022
using diplomatic channels.

25:38.090 --> 25:40.257
Diplomatic channels? General!

25:40.325 --> 25:42.559
We can't risk upsetting
relations with Costa Gravas.

25:42.627 --> 25:45.061
Their country's future
is in the balance.

25:45.129 --> 25:46.730
Until the premier makes
his announcement,

25:46.797 --> 25:49.730
I'm afraid Colonel Casey
will have to handle himself.

25:51.732 --> 25:53.366
It's been a long time.

25:54.767 --> 25:55.900
When are you going to learn

25:55.968 --> 25:57.737
you do not have the
strength to kill me?

25:57.805 --> 25:59.905
I'm here to protect you.

25:59.973 --> 26:01.707
The "Angel of Death"?

26:01.774 --> 26:03.008
You're here to protect me?

26:03.075 --> 26:04.209
Protect me how?

26:04.276 --> 26:06.877
Like in '83...
You put a bullet in my spleen.

26:06.945 --> 26:08.345
Or in '88...

26:08.413 --> 26:10.046
You blew up my dog, Chuy.

26:10.114 --> 26:11.181
Sorry about the dog.

26:11.249 --> 26:12.883
Obviously, the bomb was meant for you.

26:16.988 --> 26:19.622
I don't know... Maybe I'm
just a humble dictator here.

26:19.690 --> 26:21.190
How stupid do you think I am?

26:21.258 --> 26:22.391
I don't think you're stupid.

26:22.459 --> 26:24.392
I think your life is in danger,
you idiot.

26:24.460 --> 26:26.027
Enough!

26:28.163 --> 26:30.030
- Imperialist lies.
- Who you calling imperialist,

26:30.097 --> 26:32.533
you commie bastard?

26:32.601 --> 26:33.903
I have to get some sleep.

26:33.971 --> 26:35.305
You know, tomorrow,

26:35.373 --> 26:37.472
I will conduct your
interrogation myself.

26:41.007 --> 26:42.705
I'll do it personally.

26:44.173 --> 26:45.206
Generalissimo.

26:46.775 --> 26:48.442
- Your cigar.
- Yeah.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.401
This is genuine Costa Gravan tobacco.

27:11.402 --> 27:12.429
Uh-uh.

27:12.497 --> 27:14.964
Rolled on the thighs of virgins.

27:22.675 --> 27:26.384
Perhaps you deserve one final smoke.

27:28.587 --> 27:29.954
No.

27:39.694 --> 27:41.260
Thank you.

27:41.328 --> 27:42.827
For what?

27:42.895 --> 27:44.494
For tonight.

27:44.562 --> 27:47.430
For making me forget about all of this.

27:49.099 --> 27:51.699
Do you remember our
first day of medical school?

27:53.735 --> 27:57.637
You know, this place has
some very nice closets.

27:57.705 --> 27:59.439
Ah.

28:04.944 --> 28:06.043
Uh-uh.

28:06.111 --> 28:08.145
No phones tonight, you said.

28:08.213 --> 28:10.748
I will turn it off.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.282
It's the consulate.

28:12.350 --> 28:14.184
The premier wants to see me.

28:14.251 --> 28:16.285
Some kind of emergency.

28:19.922 --> 28:21.121
Hold on to that feeling.

28:21.189 --> 28:22.856
I will be right back.

28:22.924 --> 28:24.024
Okay.

28:29.164 --> 28:30.196
Chuck.

28:30.264 --> 28:32.098
I think I can help get Casey back.

28:32.166 --> 28:33.666
Unless you can get into the consulate

28:33.734 --> 28:34.767
without starting some
international incident,

28:34.835 --> 28:35.868
I'm not interested.

28:35.936 --> 28:37.436
That's exactly what I can do.

28:37.504 --> 28:38.571
I just got a call.

28:38.639 --> 28:39.772
The premier collapsed again.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.374
His last request was
for me to be his doctor.

28:44.644 --> 28:47.344
Devon, if you think this is
your chance to be a big spy...

28:47.412 --> 28:48.812
It's my chance to set things right.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.180
I'll get you inside,

28:50.248 --> 28:52.749
then I promise I will leave
the spy stuff to the pros.

28:56.754 --> 28:59.522
I knew you guys had a secret base.

28:59.590 --> 29:01.791
This is badass.

29:01.858 --> 29:03.092
Don't touch anything.

29:03.159 --> 29:04.359
Cool.

29:04.427 --> 29:05.527
What are you doing?

29:05.595 --> 29:06.862
Well, since we're not exactly sure

29:06.929 --> 29:08.197
where Casey's being held,

29:08.264 --> 29:10.799
I'm pulling up the
schematics for the consulate.

29:10.867 --> 29:12.400
- Where's Sarah?
- We'll call her from the road.

29:12.468 --> 29:14.636
- If she knew we were here right now...
- What the hell

29:14.703 --> 29:15.637
do you think you're doing?

29:15.638 --> 29:16.571
Well, I don't know.

29:16.638 --> 29:18.372
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

29:18.440 --> 29:20.574
Bringing a civilian in here?
Do you have any idea

29:20.642 --> 29:21.608
how far off the reservation you've gone?

29:21.676 --> 29:23.143
Oh, yeah, and what do you call

29:23.210 --> 29:24.811
invading foreign soil against orders?

29:24.878 --> 29:26.078
I have no choice.

29:27.614 --> 29:28.780
Well, we're coming with you.

29:28.848 --> 29:29.948
No. Trust me.

29:30.016 --> 29:31.449
You don't want any part of this,

29:31.517 --> 29:33.084
and neither do you. What happened?

29:33.151 --> 29:34.418
I thought you didn't want your family

29:34.486 --> 29:35.619
getting messed up with the CIA.

29:35.687 --> 29:37.054
Okay, look, before you say
anything else,

29:37.121 --> 29:39.122
and before you go running off
and getting yourself shot,

29:39.190 --> 29:40.957
Devon thinks he can get
us into the consulate.

29:41.025 --> 29:42.725
The premier has invited him

29:42.793 --> 29:44.493
to be his own persal physician.

29:44.561 --> 29:45.594
Okay, here's the plan...

29:45.661 --> 29:46.795
Stop right there.

29:46.862 --> 29:48.464
I am way ahead of you.

30:00.676 --> 30:01.709
I'm Dr. Woodcomb.

30:01.777 --> 30:03.678
We're here to see the premier.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.449
You can do this, Devon.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.283
Just relax.

30:22.594 --> 30:24.927
Hello, John Casey.

30:24.995 --> 30:26.895
NSA assassin.

30:29.498 --> 30:30.664
Who are you?

30:30.732 --> 30:32.799
The man who's going to kill you.

30:32.867 --> 30:34.701
Obviously.

30:34.769 --> 30:35.836
Who do you work for?

30:35.904 --> 30:37.504
Professional courtesy.

30:37.572 --> 30:38.973
One assassin to another.

30:39.041 --> 30:40.942
I work for an organization
known as the Ring.

30:46.449 --> 30:47.816
You want me to work in here?

30:47.884 --> 30:49.084
Is there a problem?

30:49.152 --> 30:51.386
Yeah, he needs to move to a hospital.

30:51.453 --> 30:54.919
Why? So you North Americans
can try and kill him yet again?

30:54.987 --> 30:58.155
Tsk-tsk-tsk. The premier's
orders were clear.

30:58.223 --> 31:00.090
Acute arrhythmia.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.558
This guy is hating life.

31:01.626 --> 31:02.759
Don't forget, Dr. Woodcomb...

31:02.827 --> 31:04.827
if anything happens to the premier...

31:04.895 --> 31:07.529
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

31:07.597 --> 31:09.431
All right, team, let's get to work.

31:09.499 --> 31:10.765
<i>So, what does this so-called Ring</i>

31:10.833 --> 31:12.033
have against the premier?

31:12.101 --> 31:13.401
Nothing personal.

31:13.469 --> 31:16.369
I suppose I could explain
our overarching goals...

31:16.437 --> 31:18.438
but this might tax the brain

31:18.505 --> 31:20.305
of an aging NSA agent.

31:20.373 --> 31:22.873
Let's just say the
Ring wishes to preserve

31:22.941 --> 31:25.009
Costa Gravas' status quo.

31:25.076 --> 31:27.211
The premier must die.

31:27.278 --> 31:28.712
So must you.

31:28.780 --> 31:30.581
This guy is in big trouble.

31:30.648 --> 31:32.715
I need ten units of insulin.

31:35.785 --> 31:37.919
Red bottle, yellow label.

31:39.222 --> 31:40.355
<i>On a personal note,</i>

31:40.423 --> 31:42.524
<i>I must say, I've studied your work.</i>

31:42.592 --> 31:45.192
Some of your kills
in the '80s weren't bad.

31:45.260 --> 31:46.960
Unfortunately,

31:47.028 --> 31:48.061
in our game,

31:48.129 --> 31:50.330
you're only as good as your last...

31:51.365 --> 31:53.032
kill.

31:53.100 --> 31:54.733
So, you come up with a plan yet?

31:54.801 --> 31:56.001
Oh, yeah.

31:56.069 --> 31:57.436
Yeah, the plan is, Sarah and I

31:57.504 --> 31:59.271
are going to sneak out
of here and save Casey

31:59.338 --> 32:00.771
while you stay here
and save the premier.

32:00.839 --> 32:02.473
We just got to take care
of those two guards there.

32:02.540 --> 32:04.474
Those two soldiers
with the machine guns?

32:04.542 --> 32:05.708
You and what army?

32:05.775 --> 32:07.743
Uh, that would be Sarah

32:07.810 --> 32:09.544
and, uh, her fists.

32:09.612 --> 32:11.011
Bring it on, tough guy.

32:11.079 --> 32:13.314
A thousand Costa Gravan
pesos says I walk out of here.

32:18.788 --> 32:20.489
Well...

32:20.557 --> 32:22.491
Lucky for me, I'm a marine.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.139
Shh...

32:39.206 --> 32:40.273
Relax.

32:56.153 --> 32:57.587
Let's go.

32:57.655 --> 32:59.323
That is some woman, bro.

32:59.390 --> 33:00.524
You have no idea.

33:08.063 --> 33:10.531
You owe me 15 American cents.

33:16.538 --> 33:18.071
<i>Angel de la Muerte.</i>

33:21.872 --> 33:23.038
Let's get out of this

33:23.106 --> 33:24.139
stinking banana republic.

33:24.207 --> 33:25.273
First, we got to get Awesome.

33:25.341 --> 33:26.707
You brought your brother-in-law?

33:26.775 --> 33:28.075
What the hell were you thinking?

33:29.344 --> 33:30.277
Devon, we got to get out of here.

33:30.345 --> 33:31.545
No, you've got to get out of here.

33:31.612 --> 33:32.879
Those guards are looking for you.

33:32.947 --> 33:33.663
Besides, he'll die without me.

33:33.664 --> 33:36.549
Yeah, well, we're all going to die
if they find us in here. Come on.

33:36.616 --> 33:38.649
Devon, look, we've done what we
needed to do. Now, it's time to go.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.283
Sorry, Chuck. My mission's not over.

33:40.351 --> 33:41.350
You know that man

33:41.418 --> 33:42.683
you're trying to save

33:42.751 --> 33:44.184
turned his country into a pariah state.

33:44.251 --> 33:46.652
Do you have any idea
how many people he killed?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.587
You're one to talk.

33:50.089 --> 33:52.223
<i>Angel de la Muerte.</i>

33:52.291 --> 33:54.058
Look, look,

33:54.125 --> 33:55.459
he's not here as the "Angel of Death"

33:55.527 --> 33:58.061
right now, he's here to
protect your boss; we all are.

33:58.129 --> 33:59.663
The real killer's down in my cell.

33:59.730 --> 34:00.663
We found no one.

34:00.731 --> 34:02.265
Uh...

34:04.268 --> 34:05.868
Can't you see he's
bleeding to death? Please!

34:05.936 --> 34:07.670
We will sort out who's trying to kill

34:07.738 --> 34:10.041
who later; right now,
we need to get this man to a doctor.

34:10.108 --> 34:11.876
He has a doctor.

34:11.944 --> 34:13.344
Little busy right now.

34:13.411 --> 34:15.080
Not you, him.

34:15.147 --> 34:17.050
Who "him"? Me, "him"?

34:17.985 --> 34:19.018
If you wish to prove

34:19.085 --> 34:21.454
you're not an assassin, save him.

34:23.723 --> 34:25.824
Okay.

34:25.891 --> 34:28.259
Okay, no, uh, no problem.

34:28.327 --> 34:29.360
No problem.

34:29.428 --> 34:30.360
We've done this before.

34:30.429 --> 34:31.395
We've done this many times.

34:31.463 --> 34:33.362
Uh, normally,

34:33.431 --> 34:34.664
I start with anesthesia.

34:34.732 --> 34:36.565
- No!
- Huh?

34:39.634 --> 34:41.000
Okay.

34:41.068 --> 34:42.368
Okay, no anesthesia.

34:42.436 --> 34:43.735
No anesthesia. That's fine, that's fine.

34:43.803 --> 34:45.570
He's a big, tough man.
He can deal with the pain.

34:45.638 --> 34:46.838
The bullet might've

34:46.905 --> 34:48.906
grazed his femoral artery.
Whatever you do...

34:50.342 --> 34:52.911
Let the doctor work.

34:54.447 --> 34:55.947
Nurse?

34:56.016 --> 34:57.883
Why don't you go ahead
and cut those pants open,

34:57.951 --> 34:59.718
and we'll see what we're working with.

35:03.589 --> 35:05.556
Oh, oh...

35:05.624 --> 35:06.957
Oh, it's suddenly very hot in here.

35:07.025 --> 35:08.125
It's very, very hot in here.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.359
Can somebody crack a window?

35:09.427 --> 35:11.127
No!

35:11.195 --> 35:12.829
Just as I thought.

35:16.266 --> 35:18.200
Chuck, you've got
the hands of a surgeon, bro.

35:18.268 --> 35:21.069
Don't think about the guns.

35:21.137 --> 35:22.604
He's not your friend.
He's your patient.

35:24.006 --> 35:27.307
Chuck, you can do this. Just relax.

35:35.181 --> 35:36.780
Nurse, suction.

35:37.815 --> 35:39.115
Scalpel.

35:42.553 --> 35:43.954
Tweezers.

35:45.056 --> 35:46.156
Gauze.

35:46.991 --> 35:48.024
Iodine.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.227
Forceps.

35:52.295 --> 35:53.895
Just like Operation...

35:53.963 --> 35:55.730
The game.

36:07.674 --> 36:09.675
What's wrong?

36:09.743 --> 36:11.643
I told you. There's nothing
I could do for him here.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.445
Nothing short of a blood transfusion.

36:13.512 --> 36:15.580
I don't even know
what blood type he is.

36:15.647 --> 36:17.415
AB negative.

36:17.482 --> 36:18.916
What?

36:18.983 --> 36:19.950
AB negative.

36:20.017 --> 36:22.084
Aah!

36:22.152 --> 36:23.618
His blood type's AB negative.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.154
What? You learn a lot about a guy

36:26.222 --> 36:27.255
when you're trying to kill him.

36:27.323 --> 36:28.857
What else you want to know?

36:28.924 --> 36:30.959
His favorite movie's
Terms of Endearment.

36:31.026 --> 36:32.793
He always showers

36:32.861 --> 36:34.094
after lovemaking...

36:34.162 --> 36:36.062
Okay, none of that's
going to save him now.

36:36.130 --> 36:37.163
We need someone with type

36:37.231 --> 36:39.499
AB negative blood, now. Someone big.

36:39.567 --> 36:41.933
Does anyone have
type AB negative blood?

36:42.001 --> 36:46.139
<i>¿Alguien aqui tiene
sangre tipo AB negativo?</i>

36:46.206 --> 36:47.507
Quick! Find someone! Anyone!

36:47.575 --> 36:48.674
Hey, what are you doing?

36:49.509 --> 36:51.309
Put those back!

36:51.377 --> 36:52.343
Give me that!

36:52.411 --> 36:53.544
I'm sorry, buddy.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.513
You take one drop of blood from me,

36:55.581 --> 36:57.914
I swear to God, I'll rip off your...

36:59.016 --> 37:02.686
No! No! No!

37:16.100 --> 37:17.200
Hey, Chucky.

37:18.435 --> 37:21.437
Oh, I feel like death.

37:21.505 --> 37:22.705
What happened?

37:22.772 --> 37:24.940
You're just in time, big boy.

37:25.007 --> 37:26.441
Time for what?

37:26.509 --> 37:29.110
Congratulations,
the premier made a full recovery.

37:29.177 --> 37:31.512
Although I do not endorse your methods,

37:31.579 --> 37:33.547
you enabled him to make
his announcement as planned.

37:33.614 --> 37:36.582
Costa Gravas will have
its first democratic election.

37:36.650 --> 37:38.850
And it wouldn't have been
possible without your

37:38.918 --> 37:41.919
extraordinary sacrifice.

37:41.987 --> 37:43.988
I got shot, that's
nothing extraordinary.

37:45.123 --> 37:47.691
- You don't remember?
- Huh?

37:47.759 --> 37:48.759
Remember what?

37:50.861 --> 37:53.596
You stole my blood.

37:53.664 --> 37:55.631
You stole my blood, and you

37:55.699 --> 37:57.866
put in a stinking commie despot.

37:57.934 --> 38:00.735
Former stinking commie despot.
Thank you.

38:00.803 --> 38:02.070
The premier wanted

38:02.138 --> 38:04.138
to thank you personally, Colonel Casey.

38:04.206 --> 38:06.640
But this will have to do.

38:06.708 --> 38:08.108
Huh?

38:17.682 --> 38:20.651
<i>I wish to thank you on behalf</i>

38:20.719 --> 38:22.120
<i>of Costa Gravas and myself.</i>

38:22.187 --> 38:23.554
<i>I will never forget that the blood</i>

38:23.622 --> 38:26.490
<i>of an American patriot
flows through my veins.</i>

38:26.557 --> 38:31.060
<i>John Casey,
you truly are the "Angel of Life".</i>

38:36.198 --> 38:39.934
These are prerevolutionary
Costa Gravas double coronas.

38:40.002 --> 38:42.002
Oh...

38:54.581 --> 38:56.515
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.750
How'd it go with headquarters?

38:57.817 --> 38:59.485
Yeah, uh,

38:59.552 --> 39:02.854
we didn't get a new mission,
if that's what you're wondering.

39:02.921 --> 39:04.622
Oh, no way.

39:04.689 --> 39:06.857
I think I scratched my espionage itch.

39:06.924 --> 39:08.724
Don't get me wrong.

39:08.792 --> 39:10.959
Black tie dinners and
embassy extractions

39:11.026 --> 39:13.360
are killer, but... just not worth it.

39:13.428 --> 39:15.696
What's not?

39:15.763 --> 39:17.330
If having a double life means

39:17.398 --> 39:18.831
having to give up
half of your real life,

39:18.899 --> 39:21.467
that's just not how I want to live, bro.

39:25.871 --> 39:27.837
I got to run.

39:27.905 --> 39:29.908
I've got to finish a few
things at the hospital,

39:29.976 --> 39:31.877
and then home to my wife.

39:31.945 --> 39:34.045
You two take care of each other.

39:37.282 --> 39:39.282
He would've made an awesome spy.

39:40.885 --> 39:43.185
Yeah. Yeah,
I guess it runs in the family.

39:47.523 --> 39:50.925
Uh, listen, I've been, um...

39:50.993 --> 39:52.326
I've been meaning to ask.

39:52.394 --> 39:55.162
What do you think our cover should be,

39:55.230 --> 39:57.864
you know, moving forward?

39:59.566 --> 40:02.367
Well, I think we should keep it simple.

40:02.434 --> 40:05.202
So, how about friends?

40:06.671 --> 40:08.171
Friends, huh?

40:09.574 --> 40:11.408
Yeah, that could work.

40:13.043 --> 40:16.311
I suppose I could fake being
friends with someone like you.

40:16.379 --> 40:20.081
And I don't find you completely

40:20.149 --> 40:21.716
- repulsive, so...
- Thanks.

40:21.784 --> 40:23.584
So, yeah. Friends?

40:25.186 --> 40:27.287
Yeah. Yeah, friends.

40:31.892 --> 40:34.593
So, what exactly do friends do?

40:34.661 --> 40:37.195
What do friends do?
Uh, what is it? Friday night?

40:37.263 --> 40:39.030
Friday night,
Morgan and I would normally

40:39.098 --> 40:40.698
gorge ourselves on some processed food,

40:40.766 --> 40:42.466
play some video games.

40:42.534 --> 40:44.534
Maybe we're not quite there yet.

40:44.602 --> 40:47.036
Okay, we can work on
some other options.

40:47.104 --> 40:48.237
Yeah.

40:48.304 --> 40:49.704
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

40:49.772 --> 40:50.905
Where have you been?

40:50.973 --> 40:52.740
Kind of a crazy night.

40:52.808 --> 40:54.174
I got tied up at work.

40:54.242 --> 40:55.876
Well, why don't you

40:55.944 --> 40:57.477
hurry home.

40:57.545 --> 40:59.812
I have a surprise for you.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.615
One more patient and I am on my way.

41:02.682 --> 41:04.950
I believe I owe you a dance.

41:05.018 --> 41:06.351
I love you.

41:06.419 --> 41:08.586
I love you, too.

41:13.258 --> 41:16.393
So, what seems to be the problem?

41:19.830 --> 41:21.797
Ouch, that looks like it hurts.

41:21.865 --> 41:23.499
You have no idea.

41:30.339 --> 41:31.372
Hey.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.440
Changed your mind about tonight?

41:34.976 --> 41:36.943
What?

41:39.614 --> 41:41.280
What is it?

41:50.689 --> 41:53.290
Oh, my God...

41:54.325 --> 41:55.458
Hey, guys.

41:55.526 --> 41:57.760
Have you guys seen my husband?
