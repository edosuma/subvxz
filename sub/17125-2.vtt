20:32.902 --> 20:34.003
...AND, UH,

20:34.003 --> 20:37.707
THEN STOLE MY CAR.

20:37.707 --> 20:40.840
BENNY, YOU ALWAYS WIN
 THESE THINGS.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.274
WHY ARE WE BEATING
 AROUND THE BUSH?

20:44.274 --> 20:45.545
ALL MEN ARE SCUM.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.676
MM-HMM.

20:48.578 --> 20:50.880
HELLO, LADIES.

20:52.782 --> 20:53.953
WHAT?!

20:53.953 --> 20:55.885
I NEVER KNOW WHAT I DID!
