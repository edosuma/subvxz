Previously on <i>Switched at Birth.</i>

00:03.723 --> 00:05.483
- I think I'm...
- Hung up on someone else.

00:05.484 --> 00:06.764
I don't wanna be hung up on him.

00:06.765 --> 00:07.825
Your shift is over.

00:08.693 --> 00:10.361
Good night.

00:10.362 --> 00:13.264
I'm Nikki.
Do you have an electric?

00:13.265 --> 00:15.032
- Let's rock.
- Christian rock?

00:15.033 --> 00:16.993
But I'm not sure how
I feel about dating a woman

00:16.994 --> 00:18.634
who's technically still on her honeymoon!

00:18.635 --> 00:20.070
Patrick! Come on!

00:20.071 --> 00:21.311
Simone didn't break up with me.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.472
She had sex with Emmett.

00:23.441 --> 00:24.441
Get off me!

00:26.176 --> 00:28.345
- What the hell is this?
- No way.

00:28.346 --> 00:30.506
This guy better watch out
that I don't find him, man.

00:30.507 --> 00:30.987
It's on now.

00:30.988 --> 00:32.668
I want this to happen.

00:57.506 --> 01:00.575
You're here early.

01:00.576 --> 01:02.076
I got lots of chopping to do.

01:03.879 --> 01:06.547
I should...

01:06.548 --> 01:09.016
Look,

01:09.017 --> 01:10.418
about the other night.

01:10.419 --> 01:11.018
Yeah.

01:14.589 --> 01:15.889
That can't happen again.

01:17.926 --> 01:20.727
Yeah. Okay.

01:20.728 --> 01:21.495
Yeah.

01:24.565 --> 01:26.400
So...

01:26.401 --> 01:27.600
so.

01:30.036 --> 01:33.239
- Are you still seeing Melody?
- No, I ended that.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.641
Okay.

01:35.642 --> 01:36.742
Okay.

01:50.523 --> 01:53.391
Okay.

01:53.392 --> 01:55.560
Okay...

01:58.693 --> 01:59.813
Your hair's worse than mine.

01:59.816 --> 02:01.783
Yeah. Seriously.

02:01.784 --> 02:03.785
I got wheat paste stuck
in it a couple of times.

02:03.786 --> 02:05.787
It took like five washes to get it out.

02:05.788 --> 02:07.622
- You should just get dreads.
- Really?

02:07.623 --> 02:10.419
Like, how would that work?

02:10.420 --> 02:12.581
It's so easy. You just don't
wash it for a few weeks,

02:12.582 --> 02:13.822
and then you start twisting it.

02:13.823 --> 02:14.863
Dude, I can do it for you.

02:14.864 --> 02:16.764
- Sweet!
- Yeah.

02:16.765 --> 02:19.234
Or you could cut it all off.

02:19.235 --> 02:20.955
God, I did that once. It was so liberating.

02:20.956 --> 02:21.669
Bay?

02:21.670 --> 02:24.005
Hey!

02:24.006 --> 02:25.741
How was the luncheon?
My mom got this

02:25.742 --> 02:27.742
article published in like
some parenting magazine

02:27.743 --> 02:31.278
and she had to go to this lunch thing.

02:31.279 --> 02:34.681
- Sweetie, what's goin' on here?
- Why is your car painted funny?

02:34.682 --> 02:37.684
We're bombing it.
Right? Isn't it killer?

02:37.685 --> 02:39.987
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:39.988 --> 02:42.322
- Honey...
- Sorry.

02:42.323 --> 02:46.158
This is my friend Zarra.
She is also a street artist.

02:46.159 --> 02:47.999
Zarra, these are my parents
John and Kathryn.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.029
Hey. What's up?
Nice to meet you.

02:50.030 --> 02:52.398
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

02:52.399 --> 02:54.679
Yeah, you too. Congratulations
on your article, Kathryn.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.270
Thank you.

02:57.271 --> 03:00.071
I should probably read it. Might
make me a better mom to my own kids.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.968
I'm kidding, dude.

03:05.969 --> 03:07.336
Are you crazy?

03:07.337 --> 03:08.577
You should have seen your face.

03:08.578 --> 03:11.106
- You were freaking out.
- My God!

03:11.107 --> 03:14.243
- You totally got me! I so believed you!
- I know, right?

03:14.244 --> 03:16.804
Bay, I really wish you'd talk to
us before you painted the car.

03:16.805 --> 03:17.685
Why? It's mine, right?

03:17.686 --> 03:19.781
Well, not really.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.849
I believe it's...

03:21.850 --> 03:23.812
you know what?
If you guys are thirsty,

03:23.813 --> 03:25.853
you can come inside for
some lemonade or iced tea.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.334
All right, awesome.
Hey, by the way,

03:27.335 --> 03:29.157
I'm gonna get dreads!

03:29.158 --> 03:31.393
- Just twist, right?
- You've got so much hair.

03:31.394 --> 03:33.154
- Yeah, I know. It's a lot.
- More than me.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.223
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

03:39.977 --> 03:42.330
Well, okay. Did
this girl do anything?

03:42.331 --> 03:45.500
She was just so flippant,
so comfortable around us.

03:45.501 --> 03:47.068
"Kathryn."

03:47.069 --> 03:49.135
And she has these tattoos that are

03:49.136 --> 03:51.771
basically saying, "my
private parts are flying."

03:51.772 --> 03:53.907
- Flying?
- She has wings... Down there.

03:53.908 --> 03:55.975
But that's not everything.

03:55.976 --> 03:59.246
I think that Bay has figured it out.

03:59.247 --> 04:00.814
Figured what out?

04:00.815 --> 04:02.549
That we, you know...

04:02.550 --> 04:05.117
that we're powerless.

04:05.118 --> 04:08.020
That we don't actually matter.

04:08.021 --> 04:09.501
That's ridiculous.
Of course you do.

04:09.502 --> 04:11.924
Not to Bay. Not anymore.

04:11.925 --> 04:13.587
We've tried grounding her,

04:13.588 --> 04:15.228
we've tried appealing to her better self,

04:15.229 --> 04:16.795
but nothing works.

04:16.796 --> 04:18.831
Kathryn, all you can do

04:18.832 --> 04:21.798
is hope you've instilled
them with a little sense.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.369
I wouldn't relive Regina's
teenage years for anything.

04:24.370 --> 04:25.890
Did she have a friend like this Zarra?

04:25.891 --> 04:27.339
She was that friend.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.406
I wasn't that bad.

04:31.544 --> 04:33.144
So what did you do?

04:33.145 --> 04:36.480
You know what helped at least a little,

04:36.481 --> 04:38.949
were those art classes.
It gave me something to do

04:38.950 --> 04:40.817
besides just hanging out and drinking.

04:40.818 --> 04:42.586
It's true. She won't miss cake

04:42.587 --> 04:44.555
if you give her ice cream.

04:44.556 --> 04:46.390
Exactly. You just
need to give her

04:46.391 --> 04:47.591
another source of sugar shock.

04:51.730 --> 04:54.063
Okay, so I take off my sunglasses and I say

04:54.064 --> 04:56.599
in my best James Bond,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.868
"I do apologize officer,

04:58.869 --> 05:00.936
but in england we drive
on the left side."

05:02.239 --> 05:03.706
Shoot.

05:03.707 --> 05:05.275
I'm doing a British accent

05:05.276 --> 05:06.676
and you can't even tell.

05:06.677 --> 05:09.311
I can, however, see the...

05:09.312 --> 05:11.413
Bizarre way you're moving your eyebrows.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.418
You know, I was thinking that

05:16.419 --> 05:17.986
me and you should hang out sometime...

05:17.987 --> 05:21.156
aside from work, like go on a bike ride

05:21.157 --> 05:23.124
or, I don't know, shop for hats.

05:23.125 --> 05:24.365
Just anything not food-related.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.426
No food.

05:25.427 --> 05:27.762
Scuba...

05:27.763 --> 05:29.664
God.

05:29.665 --> 05:31.299
Okay. Awkward.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.868
I'm just kinda seeing somebody right now.

05:34.869 --> 05:37.137
Right.
I should have figured.

05:37.138 --> 05:39.273
Yeah, no problem.

05:39.274 --> 05:40.807
Really. It's... it's cool.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.809
Guys, on the move.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.310
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

05:51.686 --> 05:52.452
Honey?

05:54.588 --> 05:57.055
Hey!

05:57.056 --> 05:59.725
So many girls would kill to have your hair.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.393
I'm not shaving it off, mom.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.295
You'll never guess who I ran into

06:03.296 --> 06:04.930
at the magazine luncheon today.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.833
Alex's parents.

06:07.834 --> 06:11.236
Alex, my boyfriend from
the galapagos' parents?

06:11.237 --> 06:14.077
Turns out they go to the same church
as us, which you never mentioned.

06:14.078 --> 06:16.078
Because we haven't gone
to church in nine months.

06:16.079 --> 06:17.919
Did you know that Alex
is a wonderful singer?

06:17.920 --> 06:20.578
He was the lead in "Annie
get your gun" and "gypsy."

06:20.579 --> 06:22.680
This is going somewhere I'm not gonna like.

06:22.681 --> 06:25.783
And he's a national merit scholar

06:25.784 --> 06:28.720
- and he works at a teen line.
- We're almost there.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.881
And they're all coming
to dinner this Saturday night.

06:30.882 --> 06:32.857
Bingo!

06:32.858 --> 06:36.126
Alex seems like a great kid and you
two had a wonderful time this summer.

06:36.127 --> 06:38.295
Mom, we broke up. It's gonna be

06:38.296 --> 06:39.696
super awkward!

06:39.697 --> 06:41.431
I invited Regina.

06:41.432 --> 06:43.367
I know exactly why you're doing this.

06:43.368 --> 06:46.269
Your dad and I could use some new friends.

06:46.270 --> 06:48.371
And it'll give you a chance
to reconnect with Alex.

06:48.372 --> 06:49.638
That's it.

06:49.639 --> 06:52.541
Mom. Mom!

06:52.542 --> 06:54.710
This is not gonna work!

07:08.224 --> 07:10.024
Wait, go back to what
you were doing before.

07:10.025 --> 07:10.592
What? This?

07:16.965 --> 07:19.867
Yeah. Gosh, that is awesome.

07:19.868 --> 07:21.508
I could totally hear that on a lap steel.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.204
Don't tell me you're country, too.

07:23.205 --> 07:26.607
Right.
Christian you can handle,

07:26.608 --> 07:29.043
but country... that is
just over the line.

07:31.479 --> 07:33.346
So...

07:33.347 --> 07:35.481
I know that this is way too early,

07:35.482 --> 07:37.250
but I really love your playing,

07:37.251 --> 07:39.185
and I've been trying to

07:39.186 --> 07:41.621
break out of the solo thing.

07:41.622 --> 07:44.657
And there's this battle of the
bands coming up next month

07:44.658 --> 07:47.326
and... I don't know.
I was just wondering

07:47.327 --> 07:50.262
if maybe you wanted to work
up a few songs or something.

07:53.467 --> 07:54.667
It doesn't have to be a thing.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.703
Sorry, I'm freaking you out,

07:58.704 --> 08:00.271
aren't I?

08:00.272 --> 08:03.809
No no. I just...

08:03.810 --> 08:06.511
I recently got out of this band situation

08:06.512 --> 08:07.512
that ended kind of weird.

08:07.513 --> 08:09.981
Right.

08:09.982 --> 08:12.417
Well, it's not the right time.
I get it.

08:12.418 --> 08:14.585
Yeah, but, you know, we can still hang out,

08:14.586 --> 08:17.488
trade songs, go to Roy's.

08:17.489 --> 08:20.858
You know Roy's?
I love that place.

08:20.859 --> 08:22.292
They have the best gear, but...

08:22.293 --> 08:23.293
The worst staff.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.990
I think I single-handedly
kept them in business last year.

08:27.991 --> 08:30.800
Well. Then on behalf
of gearheads everywhere...

08:40.174 --> 08:42.674
Meg, don't kill the tomatoes.
Get a sharper knife.

08:46.360 --> 08:46.992
What?

09:04.100 --> 09:06.868
So let me get this straight. We're
now throwing boys at the problem?

09:06.869 --> 09:08.109
We're not throwing boys at her,

09:08.110 --> 09:10.371
we're redirecting her.

09:10.372 --> 09:13.607
We're presenting her with a more
attractive option than that girl.

09:13.608 --> 09:15.075
Okay, let me tell you something.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.211
When I was a kid, my dad's word was law.

09:17.212 --> 09:19.479
No negotiating, no redirecting.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.714
You did what you were told...

09:20.715 --> 09:22.349
- ...or else.
- Yeah.

09:22.350 --> 09:24.310
Is that really how
you wanna raise Bay and Toby?

09:24.311 --> 09:26.420
I didn't turn out so bad.

09:26.421 --> 09:29.488
And you barely talked to
your father after you left home.

09:29.489 --> 09:32.358
Didn't Bay already reject this kid?

09:32.359 --> 09:34.719
Yeah. Well, that's when she was
still hurting from Emmett.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.080
Maybe she'll feel differently now.

09:37.798 --> 09:40.646
Liquor store or groceries?

09:42.502 --> 09:44.637
Bay and Toby are fundamentally good kids.

09:44.638 --> 09:47.340
I know.

09:47.341 --> 09:49.775
I also know that that
is largely due to you.

09:49.776 --> 09:51.143
So then trust me on this.

09:53.347 --> 09:53.946
Okay.

10:18.470 --> 10:21.137
Hey! What are you doing?

10:21.138 --> 10:24.675
I'm just looking for my phone.

10:24.676 --> 10:26.543
What's it to you?

10:26.544 --> 10:29.012
Well, I happen to know
the owner of this car.

10:29.013 --> 10:30.748
- And it's not you.
- Yeah. Relax.

10:30.749 --> 10:32.081
I happen to know the owner too.

10:32.082 --> 10:34.417
Hey!

10:34.418 --> 10:37.687
I got you a mocha.

10:37.688 --> 10:39.422
What are you doing here?

10:39.423 --> 10:42.558
- I'm going to work.
- Cool.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.660
I see that you met Zarra.

10:44.661 --> 10:46.661
Yeah, she thought I was
trying to boost your car.

10:46.662 --> 10:47.342
Well, you're not.

10:47.343 --> 10:49.398
So this is Daphne.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.200
Daphne is the other
Kennish-Vasquez.

10:52.201 --> 10:53.334
Nice to meet you.

10:53.335 --> 10:56.170
You too.

10:56.171 --> 10:58.807
Are you ready?
We should get going.

10:58.808 --> 11:00.568
- Yeah, did you get the paint?
- Yeah yeah.

11:00.569 --> 11:02.009
- I'm good. Let's go.
- Okay. Cool.

11:02.010 --> 11:04.712
Hey, have a good night at work

11:04.713 --> 11:07.114
and I guess I'll see you at home?

11:19.369 --> 11:21.169
No! No no no no no.

11:21.170 --> 11:22.838
God.

11:25.441 --> 11:27.441
- What's wrong?
- Does that look poached to you?

11:28.545 --> 11:30.345
Maybe you can make another batch.

11:30.346 --> 11:31.446
This is everything, Daphne.

11:31.447 --> 11:32.747
All the shrimp?

11:34.517 --> 11:36.450
Maybe we can save it?

11:36.451 --> 11:37.951
As long as chef doesn't see.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.790
He's gonna fire me.

11:42.791 --> 11:43.391
I know it.

11:46.896 --> 11:49.731
Unless you take the bullet for me.

11:49.732 --> 11:51.892
- If you say it was you...
- I don't wanna get fired!

11:51.893 --> 11:54.034
Come on, Daphne.
He's not gonna fire you.

11:54.035 --> 11:54.701
Why not?

11:56.704 --> 12:00.707
Look, I need this job.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.028
He's gonna be in here any minute.

12:02.029 --> 12:02.809
Please?

12:07.419 --> 12:09.721
This was a nice surprise.

12:09.722 --> 12:13.591
I just thought we shouldn't be
one of those couples that just

12:13.592 --> 12:14.727
drifts apart.

12:14.728 --> 12:16.288
Well, to be fair, we didn't just drift,

12:16.289 --> 12:18.249
we kinda had a giant
obstacle thrown in our way.

12:18.250 --> 12:21.199
It's a fake marriage.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.920
And I don't think it's a good enough reason

12:22.921 --> 12:24.969
for us to just call it quits.

12:24.970 --> 12:27.038
So you are gonna have
to give me something else.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.675
I got nothin'.

12:30.676 --> 12:31.308
Exactly.

12:33.945 --> 12:35.846
- I've missed you.
- I know.

12:35.847 --> 12:38.247
What are you doing tonight?

12:38.248 --> 12:41.417
I'm supposed to join
the Kennishes for dinner.

12:41.418 --> 12:43.219
With Daphne?

12:43.220 --> 12:45.822
No. Just me.

12:45.823 --> 12:48.792
Kathryn's trying to keep Bay away
from this girl that she's been

12:48.793 --> 12:51.561
hanging out with.
It's a long story.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.229
Socializing with the Kennishes
without the kids? Is this a first?

12:54.230 --> 12:58.366
Yeah. I guess so.

12:58.367 --> 12:59.567
Now I really want you to come.

13:01.537 --> 13:02.037
I'm there.

13:05.742 --> 13:06.441
Yay.

13:09.528 --> 13:10.628
What the hell is this?!

13:14.533 --> 13:16.573
What, are we serving
shrimp-flavored crap tonight?

13:16.574 --> 13:17.901
Where's Scuba?

13:17.902 --> 13:21.105
Right here, chef.

13:21.106 --> 13:24.186
Hundreds of dollars of premium Gulf
shrimp that I have to dump in the trash.

13:24.187 --> 13:26.510
So we 86 the shrimp tostada,
the shrimp pistou.

13:26.511 --> 13:29.179
We cut the garnish off of the squash soup.

13:29.180 --> 13:32.215
And I better come up with a new
way to do the Risotto,

13:32.216 --> 13:35.752
All because my prep cook
doesn't know how to poach!

13:35.753 --> 13:37.053
He didn't do it.

13:38.989 --> 13:40.223
I did.

13:43.527 --> 13:44.360
You did?

13:47.969 --> 13:50.738
I told Scuba I'd do it,
but I was making the sauce

13:50.739 --> 13:54.146
and I just...
I let them overcook.

13:56.411 --> 13:58.779
You know what poaching is, right?

13:58.780 --> 14:01.247
It's knowing how to keep the
heat turned to low. That's it.

14:01.248 --> 14:05.218
I know.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.539
So if you can't grasp that, I don't know
what the hell you're doing in my kitchen.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.805
Scuba, go tell the manager to take
the shrimp dishes off the menu.

14:18.565 --> 14:20.098
Thank you.

14:29.108 --> 14:31.809
Good evening. Pero que guapo.

14:31.810 --> 14:33.311
Thanks. You look nice.

14:33.312 --> 14:35.079
Do I have two dates tonight?

14:35.080 --> 14:37.982
No. Gloria and I are going
out for Indian food.

14:37.983 --> 14:40.083
Which Regina hates.

14:40.084 --> 14:43.253
Yes, so I get it as much
as I can when I'm out.

14:43.254 --> 14:45.788
And then they're hitting the
slots at that riverboat casino.

14:45.789 --> 14:49.559
♪ I'm feeling lucky. ♪
have fun tonight.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.697
You know, I'm feeling lucky too.

14:54.464 --> 14:57.433
Hold that thought.

14:57.434 --> 14:58.967
Could you?

14:58.968 --> 15:00.268
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

15:09.846 --> 15:10.478
Hey.

15:12.781 --> 15:13.981
How could you forget his name?

15:13.982 --> 15:16.384
You met him, didn't you?

15:16.385 --> 15:19.354
Hang on, I have it written down.

15:19.355 --> 15:21.423
I can't believe you are
still this bad at names.

15:23.325 --> 15:24.959
Mosley.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.428
Okay. That's a little weird.

15:29.965 --> 15:31.832
Stop it.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.935
No, I'm serious, okay? Stop.

15:33.936 --> 15:36.537
Listen, I gotta go.
Dinner plans.

15:36.538 --> 15:37.271
Okay. Bye.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.176
I'm sorry. He,

15:42.177 --> 15:43.897
can't remember the name of Kathryn's friend

15:43.898 --> 15:45.218
that's he's up there working for.

15:45.219 --> 15:47.013
Hey. None of
my business, really.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.215
He's just terrible with names.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.183
Really. It's okay.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.552
Okay.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.193
- Hi, come on in. It's so nice to see you.
- Hi!

16:01.194 --> 16:04.262
- Nice to see you.
- John, this is Cheryl.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.623
- And you must be Ted.
- Hi, how are you? This is for you.

16:06.624 --> 16:07.700
- Thank you!
- Hey, Ted.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.501
Thank you. And Alex. Hello.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.462
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, good to see you.

16:11.463 --> 16:12.703
- Hi.
- Why don't you come in.

16:12.704 --> 16:12.984
Please.

16:12.985 --> 16:15.873
What a lovely home.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.976
- Bay, they're here!
- She'll be down in a second.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.577
- I'm cool. Thanks.
- Sorry we're late.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.946
Our youngest had a fencing match.

16:21.947 --> 16:25.449
He's fifth in the state.

16:25.450 --> 16:28.210
And you know how colleges love those
off-the-beaten-track athletics.

16:28.211 --> 16:29.754
Right right.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.275
Well, I'm sure your kids are doing
the same college tap dance.

16:32.276 --> 16:33.890
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah.

16:33.891 --> 16:36.047
Dylan does soup kitchen on Thursdays,

16:36.048 --> 16:37.928
volunteers at the mayor's
office on Saturdays.

16:37.929 --> 16:39.696
It never ends.

16:39.697 --> 16:42.165
Well, here she is!

16:42.166 --> 16:44.267
Hi.

16:44.268 --> 16:45.788
- Hi.
- Well, I can certainly see why

16:45.789 --> 16:47.149
Alex can't stop talking about you.

16:47.150 --> 16:48.638
Mom.

16:48.639 --> 16:49.505
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:51.274 --> 16:53.308
Join me for an aperitif?

16:53.309 --> 16:55.444
Yeah... why not?

16:55.445 --> 16:57.713
Aperitif. Ha.

16:57.714 --> 16:59.714
- Would you like to go in the den?
- Sure.

17:01.484 --> 17:05.020
Look. I'm so sorry
about all of this.

17:05.021 --> 17:07.300
It's cool. I was looking for
a way to see you again too.

17:07.301 --> 17:10.223
No! I didn't.
Trust me, this wasn't my idea.

17:13.194 --> 17:15.329
No. It's just...
my parents are freaking out

17:15.329 --> 17:18.398
about some friends of... mine.

17:18.400 --> 17:22.335
Never mind.

17:22.336 --> 17:24.503
Well, I'll just go see
what my folks are up to.

17:42.172 --> 17:44.732
Hey, bro. Let me know if you wanna
plug anything in, all right?

17:44.733 --> 17:46.409
Thanks. I think
we're just looking.

17:46.410 --> 17:50.312
Actually, can I see this one up here?

17:50.313 --> 17:52.982
That's a '72 Gibson les Paul right there.

17:52.983 --> 17:54.750
Pretty heavy sound.

17:54.751 --> 17:57.185
It's so pretty.

17:57.186 --> 17:58.954
Yes, it is. But looks
can be deceiving.

17:58.955 --> 18:01.223
Go easy there.

18:01.224 --> 18:03.993
It's heavy.

18:03.994 --> 18:06.360
Well, we do got some Fender
squires in the back.

18:06.361 --> 18:09.229
Really melodious.
Might be better for you.

18:23.110 --> 18:24.931
I think she's done this before.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.416
Right.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.377
You let me know if you
need anything else, okay?

18:31.378 --> 18:32.152
Will do.

18:34.956 --> 18:37.623
Having fun?

18:37.624 --> 18:40.325
Come on, I couldn't just let that go.
He was too easy.

18:44.865 --> 18:46.365
"Doodles"?

18:46.366 --> 18:48.400
I know. It's random.

18:48.401 --> 18:49.701
It's my boyfriend, Jed.

18:50.537 --> 18:52.571
Hey!

18:52.572 --> 18:54.439
Can I call you back?

18:54.440 --> 18:56.007
Okay. Cool.

18:59.545 --> 19:01.345
You have a boyfriend.

19:01.346 --> 19:02.914
Yeah.

19:04.717 --> 19:06.150
What's wrong?

19:06.151 --> 19:07.886
Nothing. No.

19:07.887 --> 19:11.455
He goes to K.S.A.C.

19:11.456 --> 19:13.423
It's an agricultural college.

19:13.424 --> 19:15.258
He's a farm boy.

19:15.259 --> 19:17.194
Long distance...
it kinda sucks,

19:17.195 --> 19:18.862
but it is what it is.

19:18.863 --> 19:21.899
Right.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.867
I'm sorry. I guess I should
have mentioned that.

19:28.238 --> 19:30.994
I just didn't find a convenient
place to stick it in

19:30.995 --> 19:32.675
so it wouldn't sound totally presumptuous.

19:36.814 --> 19:40.149
Can I play something for you?

19:40.150 --> 19:42.751
Try to push past this
incredibly awkward moment.

19:44.521 --> 19:46.688
Sure. Why not?

19:46.689 --> 19:50.326
So, turns out, their son was
trying to bribe Alex here

19:50.327 --> 19:52.328
into taking the S.A.T. For him.

19:52.329 --> 19:54.930
'Cause both of our kids
ace standardized tests.

19:54.931 --> 19:57.298
- Dad.
- Hey, it's true.

19:57.299 --> 19:59.501
It's true. It's one of the
hazards of being so bright.

20:00.569 --> 20:02.170
Do you two have children?

20:02.171 --> 20:05.473
No... I mean, yes.
But not together.

20:05.474 --> 20:07.074
Well, there's always time.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.677
No. I don't think so.

20:09.678 --> 20:11.812
How long have you been married?

20:11.813 --> 20:13.213
Well, actually, Regina's married...

20:13.214 --> 20:15.048
- you know, three months.
- Hey!

20:15.049 --> 20:17.184
- Newlyweds!
- Yeah, kinda.

20:17.185 --> 20:18.418
Congratulations!

20:18.419 --> 20:19.586
Yeah. Congratulations.

20:19.587 --> 20:20.954
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:20.955 --> 20:23.257
Yay.

20:26.122 --> 20:28.088
Bay, no cellphones at the table.

20:28.089 --> 20:31.691
Sorry, I forgot.
I had a... you know what?

20:31.692 --> 20:34.192
- I'll be right back. Just two seconds.
- Honey, no...

20:38.099 --> 20:41.302
- hello?
- It's me. I'm in the county jail.

20:41.303 --> 20:45.305
What?! You mean,
like "jail" jail?

20:45.306 --> 20:48.408
Yeah, I got jumped by smak
and some of his boys.

20:48.409 --> 20:52.878
What do you mean? Like you were beat up?
Are you okay?

20:52.879 --> 20:55.999
- Wait, why were you arrested?
- Look, I gotta go. I'll explain it all later,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.040
but, I need you to come
down here and bail me out.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.485
No, of course. I get it.

20:59.486 --> 21:03.188
It's $1500.

21:03.189 --> 21:05.257
That's a lot of money.

21:05.258 --> 21:06.992
But you can pull it together, right?

21:06.993 --> 21:11.463
I, don't know.

21:11.464 --> 21:13.765
Look, I don't have anybody else to call.

21:13.766 --> 21:15.667
I wouldn't ask you if I did.

21:15.668 --> 21:18.635
I gotta get out of here.

21:18.636 --> 21:19.876
I'll be there as soon as I can.

21:29.001 --> 21:30.801
No, that's not true!

21:30.802 --> 21:33.112
I swear to God.
It really happened.

21:33.113 --> 21:35.033
Hey, sorry about that.
It was the wrong number.

21:35.034 --> 21:36.754
You know what?
I just got this great idea.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.275
Why don't Alex and I go out for gelato

21:38.276 --> 21:40.677
down at the new place by the crossroads?

21:40.678 --> 21:42.846
Well, I made your favorite
pumpkin cheesecake, honey.

21:42.847 --> 21:44.748
Yeah, but I can bring
back some for everybody.

21:44.749 --> 21:46.349
You love the toasted almond, am I right?

21:46.350 --> 21:48.618
Alex, you game?

21:48.619 --> 21:51.354
Yeah, sure.
I mean, if you guys...

21:51.355 --> 21:52.822
- go!
- Terrific.

21:52.823 --> 21:54.323
Bring me back some stracciatella.

21:56.027 --> 21:57.860
- Have fun!
- Bye.

22:10.006 --> 22:12.474
I just came in for some eggs.
I can get 'em later.

22:12.475 --> 22:13.775
No, you won't.

22:13.776 --> 22:15.136
We have to talk about that shrimp.

22:15.137 --> 22:17.545
Okay.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.781
I'm sorry I had to yell at you like that.

22:19.782 --> 22:21.749
I really hope to
hell it doesn't happen again.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.750
I have to treat you
just like any other employee,

22:23.751 --> 22:25.711
even though I really want
to kiss you right now.

22:26.188 --> 22:27.822
I completely understand.

22:27.823 --> 22:28.422
Good!

22:31.158 --> 22:33.126
And get back to work!

22:33.127 --> 22:35.228
I'm glad we had this talk.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.029
Me too.

22:39.180 --> 22:41.940
Does Toby have anything that he can
put on his college applications?

22:41.941 --> 22:44.350
- Anything?
- He has lacrosse.

22:44.351 --> 22:48.087
Yeah, which he quit. And the
band, which he disbanded.

22:48.088 --> 22:51.199
Yeah, I wanted to do those
prodigy cds when I was pregnant,

22:51.200 --> 22:54.360
- but you said they were stupid.
- And Bay has never done anything at Buckner.

22:54.361 --> 22:55.921
What about the teacher recommendations?

22:55.922 --> 22:58.031
Have we even started on those?

22:58.032 --> 23:00.592
- You're having a panic attack.
- By the way, how could you let

23:00.593 --> 23:03.233
her walk around the streets of
Kansas City at this time of night?

23:03.234 --> 23:04.874
She's getting ice cream.
I don't know...

23:04.875 --> 23:06.238
hi. I'm so sorry.

23:06.239 --> 23:07.740
We'll be out in a minute.

23:07.741 --> 23:09.708
I was wondering if we
could play some music.

23:09.709 --> 23:11.811
- Sure.
- Yeah.

23:11.812 --> 23:13.412
Anything in particular?

23:13.413 --> 23:16.805
Well, I teach salsa at K.C.C.C.

23:16.806 --> 23:19.486
And I thought it might be kinda fun
to get everyone up and moving.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.329
That sounds like fun.
Doesn't it, honey?

23:21.330 --> 23:22.010
Yeah, it's great.

23:22.755 --> 23:23.855
I'll just go pop in a cd.

23:23.856 --> 23:25.356
I have a few in my purse.

23:27.927 --> 23:30.207
At least we won't have to hear
about their kids anymore.

23:32.330 --> 23:35.398

24:25.981 --> 24:28.341
I hope whoever broke your heart
actually got to hear that.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.950
We actually never met.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.456
It's about the man who shot my dad.

24:40.661 --> 24:42.929
God. I'm...

24:42.930 --> 24:45.464
I'm sorry.

24:45.465 --> 24:48.401
He was parked at the mall

24:48.402 --> 24:53.005
and some guy walked up to him and shot him.

24:53.006 --> 24:55.841
The police figure that
the guy must have thought

24:55.842 --> 24:57.475
my dad was somebody else.

24:57.476 --> 25:00.579
That's awful.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.781
The police never found the guy.

25:02.782 --> 25:05.651
So...

25:05.652 --> 25:09.587
I can't believe that's
the song that you wrote...

25:09.588 --> 25:11.221
About that.

25:11.222 --> 25:15.026
Well. It's been a couple years

25:15.027 --> 25:18.663
and I wrote a lot of angry songs first.

25:18.664 --> 25:20.344
And then I started doing a lot of drugs...

25:21.767 --> 25:24.868
And stopped eating.

25:24.869 --> 25:27.037
And then my mom freaked out on me

25:27.038 --> 25:31.274
because she was afraid
that I was going to die too,

25:31.275 --> 25:34.711
like Amy Winehouse or something.

25:34.712 --> 25:37.781
I just got so tired
of letting this horrible thing

25:37.782 --> 25:39.748
that happened consume my entire life.

25:40.427 --> 25:41.994
So I decided to let it go.

25:44.564 --> 25:46.031
Just like that.

25:46.032 --> 25:49.268
Kind of.

25:49.269 --> 25:53.172
I was just so angry all of the time

25:53.173 --> 25:55.039
and I didn't even know it.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.176
It was, like, eating me up.

25:58.177 --> 26:00.011
And I just decided to not let it win.

26:07.787 --> 26:10.707
You know at some point we are
actually gonna have to return with gelato.

26:10.708 --> 26:13.256
There's a $300 limit.

26:13.257 --> 26:17.561
- You didn't know that?
- Okay, well that's just $1200 to go.

26:17.562 --> 26:20.364
Right? I don't even have $1500.

26:20.365 --> 26:22.232
I-I don't even know
what I was thinking.

26:22.233 --> 26:24.162
All right. Well,
you clearly don't need me

26:24.163 --> 26:27.203
or even know that I'm here, so I'm just
gonna let you deal with whatever...

26:27.204 --> 26:29.872
do you have an account? I
will pay you back, I promise.

26:29.873 --> 26:32.442
Are you seriously asking me
for cash right now?

26:32.443 --> 26:34.076
You are unbelievable!

26:34.077 --> 26:35.557
What are you doing?
You're my cover.

26:35.558 --> 26:37.447
Let me get this straight.

26:37.448 --> 26:39.849
You dump me out of the blue for your ex,

26:39.850 --> 26:42.052
then your parents invite
me over against your will,

26:42.053 --> 26:44.453
thinking I'm some loser who
will keep you out of trouble...

26:44.454 --> 26:45.774
they do not think you're a loser.

26:45.775 --> 26:47.855
You use me to ditch dinner
and chauffeur you around

26:47.856 --> 26:50.776
- as you compile a massive amount of money...
- First of all, I drove...

26:50.777 --> 26:51.977
for some mystery phone call...

26:51.978 --> 26:52.818
my friend is in jail!

26:55.064 --> 26:58.499
And I need to come up with

26:58.500 --> 27:00.133
$1500 to bail her out.

27:08.744 --> 27:10.811
- Hello?
- It's eight ball.

27:10.812 --> 27:13.581
My God, hi.
Are you with Zarra?

27:13.582 --> 27:16.949
She's still in.
You gotta get her out.

27:16.950 --> 27:20.152
Yeah, I'm trying to figure
out a way to reach her.

27:20.153 --> 27:23.222
I don't think I can get that kind
of money together in one night.

27:23.223 --> 27:25.306
- I don't have access to...
- Listen.

27:25.307 --> 27:27.827
She's hurt and there are people
there who wanna hurt her more.

27:27.828 --> 27:29.028
You gotta figure it out, okay?

27:29.029 --> 27:30.189
You gotta just figure it out.

27:32.265 --> 27:33.365
Okay.

27:36.969 --> 27:39.538
Hey. What happened?

27:39.539 --> 27:41.640
Who was that?

27:41.641 --> 27:42.961
I know you're mad and I get that.

27:44.236 --> 27:47.311
But would you please come
with me to one more place?

27:50.493 --> 27:52.216
Thank you.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.843
I can't believe you have
a friend named eight ball.

27:56.058 --> 27:58.178
We start with our left.
We go forward with our left.

27:58.792 --> 28:00.659
One, two, three... back...
five, six, seven.

28:00.660 --> 28:02.327
One, two...

28:02.328 --> 28:04.130
other foot... back.
Five, six, seven.

28:04.131 --> 28:06.198
- What happened to four?
- Four is a pause.

28:06.199 --> 28:07.666
- Five, six, seven.
- Pause.

28:07.667 --> 28:08.901
One, two, three,

28:08.902 --> 28:10.636
five, six, seven.

28:10.637 --> 28:13.437
Looking good, ladies!

28:13.438 --> 28:17.408
- Good, guys.
- "Salsa" means sauce. It's got to be spicy!

28:17.409 --> 28:19.778
And I guarantee if you're good at salsa,

28:19.779 --> 28:24.082
you're good at something else.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.283
You guys get this down and
we'll move on to the mambo.

28:26.284 --> 28:27.364
Don't even joke about that.

28:27.365 --> 28:29.386
- Let's try a turn.
- A turn?!

28:29.387 --> 28:32.256
One, pivot, three, pivot.

28:32.257 --> 28:34.657
- Five, six, seven.
- Hey, how come you're so good at this?

28:34.658 --> 28:36.760
- I was a cheerleader.
- Yes, you were...

28:36.761 --> 28:38.921
Hey, sweetie, get the music.
Should we get the music?

28:38.922 --> 28:39.602
- No! No!
- Yes!

28:39.603 --> 28:41.932
Yes, music!

28:41.933 --> 28:44.133
It'll all makes sense when we do it, okay?

28:44.134 --> 28:45.974
- Partner up like I showed you.
- Okay, okay.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.270
- Boy.
- You ready?

28:47.271 --> 28:49.071
It's a piece of cake.
You got it.

28:49.072 --> 28:51.107
Okay, so we'll do one basic...

28:51.108 --> 28:52.702
one turn, one basic,

28:52.703 --> 28:54.343
one turn, and then we'll just keep going.

28:54.344 --> 28:55.678
- Got it?
- I don't know.

28:55.679 --> 28:56.846
One, two, three,

28:56.847 --> 28:58.414
five, six, seven.

28:58.415 --> 29:02.083
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

29:02.084 --> 29:03.444
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

29:03.445 --> 29:05.987
One, two, three... good!

29:07.223 --> 29:08.690
One, two, turn.

29:08.691 --> 29:10.658
Men, shake those hips!

29:10.659 --> 29:14.329
Ladies, feel spicy!

29:14.330 --> 29:15.429
Hey, let's get faster now.

29:19.567 --> 29:21.135
Hey now!

29:22.938 --> 29:24.738
I wanna learn that!

29:24.739 --> 29:26.040
What's this?

29:34.949 --> 29:36.282
- Your turn.
- Your turn.

29:36.283 --> 29:37.416
- No no no no.
- Come on.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.522
Honey, it's too fast
for me. I can't do this.

29:43.523 --> 29:46.059
- Well, just let me lead then.
- Okay.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.260
All right, just stand there
and I'll twirl around you.

29:48.261 --> 29:48.821
I can do that.

29:48.822 --> 29:50.295
Watch this!

29:50.296 --> 29:51.529
Do my skirt. Do my skirt.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.253
You have got to loosen your
hips just a little bit.

30:02.254 --> 30:04.008
This is as loose as they get.

30:04.009 --> 30:06.411
Just bend your knees
and the hips will follow.

30:06.412 --> 30:07.892
What, latinas are born knowing salsa?

30:07.893 --> 30:08.880
Of course not.

30:08.881 --> 30:10.181
I had a few lessons.

30:15.287 --> 30:16.388
All right.

30:16.389 --> 30:18.022
You're supposed to dip me.

30:18.023 --> 30:19.523
Well, I didn't take the lessons.

30:20.692 --> 30:22.493
Patrick.

30:22.494 --> 30:26.196
It was 17 years ago.

30:26.197 --> 30:29.065
You can't be mad that angelo
and I had a few dance lessons.

30:29.066 --> 30:30.934
Great dancers; Great sex.

30:30.935 --> 30:32.436
I never said that.

30:32.437 --> 30:34.237
Why is it his name always comes up

30:34.238 --> 30:35.671
no matter what we're doing?

30:35.672 --> 30:38.741
I didn't bring him up.

30:38.742 --> 30:41.076
Okay, that's great!
Let's try it again.

30:41.077 --> 30:41.677
Excuse me.

30:44.848 --> 30:45.915
Excuse me.

30:49.185 --> 30:50.720
Okay, what just happened?

30:50.721 --> 30:53.354
The guy lives 30 feet from you,

30:53.355 --> 30:56.558
you have a history, a kid... I
can never compete with that.

30:56.559 --> 30:58.660
I can't erase him from my life.

30:58.661 --> 31:00.429
I kept thinking that it was me,

31:00.430 --> 31:02.864
that I was making up
how important he is to you.

31:02.865 --> 31:05.634
It's not me. He's there.

31:05.635 --> 31:07.715
The marriage is just so
he can stay in the country.

31:07.716 --> 31:08.276
You know that.

31:10.139 --> 31:12.219
I can handle being with
a woman in a fake marriage.

31:14.576 --> 31:17.076
I just can't handle being
with a woman in a real one.

31:29.857 --> 31:31.925
Did you move all the sea bass?

31:31.926 --> 31:33.427
- Yes, chef.
- Good.

31:33.428 --> 31:35.728
Javier, let's get that
duck in the reach-in.

31:35.729 --> 31:37.797
Thanks for rolling
with the 12-top, everyone.

31:37.798 --> 31:39.838
I'll try to figure out
why it wasn't on the books,

31:39.839 --> 31:43.469
but, overall, not too
terrible of a night for us.

31:43.470 --> 31:45.671
Scuba, I need to talk to you for a second.

31:45.672 --> 31:47.606
Yeah. What's up?

31:47.607 --> 31:49.608
You're off the schedule.

31:49.609 --> 31:51.477
What do you mean?

31:51.478 --> 31:53.479
You ruined hundreds
of dollars worth of shrimp

31:53.480 --> 31:55.980
and you tried to get your
co-worker to take the blame.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.083
Daphne asked if she could...

31:58.084 --> 32:00.084
Daphne was nowhere near that burner.

32:03.655 --> 32:04.535
Yeah, I didn't realize

32:04.536 --> 32:06.056
you put a lo-Jack
on your girlfriend.

32:11.597 --> 32:12.229
Get out.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.300
Get out of my kitchen

32:16.301 --> 32:17.101
now!

32:22.240 --> 32:23.573
What happened?

32:23.574 --> 32:24.814
What happened is your boyfriend

32:24.815 --> 32:26.255
just fired me, that's what happened.

32:26.256 --> 32:27.511
Wait. What did you just say?

32:28.345 --> 32:30.246
Your boyfriend just fired me.

32:42.667 --> 32:44.668
The code is my dad's R.B.I.

32:44.669 --> 32:47.838
The reserve bank of India?

32:47.839 --> 32:50.640
No, it's "runs batted in."

32:56.113 --> 32:57.714
My God!

32:57.715 --> 32:58.915
- Get back!
- Wait wait wait!

32:58.916 --> 33:00.083
I know him. I know him.

33:00.084 --> 33:01.324
What are you doing? It's Bay...

33:01.325 --> 33:02.125
put the trophy down.

33:04.922 --> 33:08.591
What are you doing here?

33:08.592 --> 33:10.472
- Is this Emmett?
- No, he's another deaf guy.

33:10.473 --> 33:12.661
This is Travis.
He works for my dad.

33:23.373 --> 33:24.873
No! What?!

33:24.874 --> 33:26.041
Hey, what did he say?

33:26.042 --> 33:27.082
Just don't worry about it.

33:27.083 --> 33:29.677
Look, I need to borrow

33:29.678 --> 33:32.447
some money from the safe.

33:32.448 --> 33:33.882
You're taking money from the safe.

33:33.883 --> 33:35.403
What did you think that we were doing?

33:35.404 --> 33:35.924
I don't know!

33:37.887 --> 33:39.287
It's for a friend who's in trouble.

33:43.626 --> 33:46.661
1,200.

33:46.662 --> 33:48.662
But I'm gonna pay it back
by tomorrow, I promise.

33:52.467 --> 33:54.868
Travis, it's really important.

33:54.869 --> 33:57.504
Believe me, I would not
be here if it wasn't.

34:01.910 --> 34:03.210
Are you sleeping here?

34:07.448 --> 34:08.681
So is he gonna do it?

34:14.588 --> 34:15.387
No.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.792
I'm not gonna tell my dad
that you're sleeping here.

34:23.728 --> 34:27.364
Even if you don't open the safe.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.106
He's doing it.

35:11.441 --> 35:12.741
Me too.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.338
Honey, just leave it.

35:30.339 --> 35:32.099
- Toby can help you in the morning.
- Okay.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.376
Only if you promise not
to do any more dishes.

35:34.377 --> 35:36.144
Done.

35:40.615 --> 35:43.055
- Bay is taking Alex home and she promises...
- No no no no.

35:43.056 --> 35:44.536
- ...to be home...
- No, not a word!

35:44.537 --> 35:45.497
- What?!
- No kid talk!

35:45.498 --> 35:46.354
- But...
- No no!

35:49.957 --> 35:51.437
They're never gonna get into college.

35:51.438 --> 35:52.826
You know what?

35:52.827 --> 35:55.563
Our kids are fine.

35:55.564 --> 35:57.764
I don't want a kid who fakes
interest in some sport

35:57.765 --> 36:00.267
from the renaissance. Come on.

36:00.268 --> 36:02.828
Or pretends they wanna go stuff
envelopes in the mayor's office

36:02.829 --> 36:04.398
on Saturdays.
Come on! What is that?

36:04.399 --> 36:06.439
But those are the kind
of kids that are getting...

36:06.440 --> 36:08.880
- You know what? You know what?
- ...lnto college right now.

36:08.881 --> 36:10.401
You know what?
Every once in a while,

36:10.402 --> 36:13.319
you and I deserve to have an evening

36:13.320 --> 36:14.880
where we pretend that they don't exist.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.819
It was pretty fun tonight,

36:20.820 --> 36:23.255
You were...

36:23.256 --> 36:24.976
you were incredibly sexy out there tonight.

36:27.760 --> 36:31.029
And you have absolutely no rhythm.

36:31.030 --> 36:31.830
- None.
- Yes I do.

36:31.831 --> 36:32.431
No.

36:52.850 --> 36:53.583
You're still here.

36:57.788 --> 37:00.657
I just...

37:00.658 --> 37:02.392
I can't believed you fired Scuba.

37:02.393 --> 37:04.861
I can't believe they all know about us.

37:04.862 --> 37:08.526
Hey. He wasn't pulling his weight
around here for some time now.

37:08.527 --> 37:12.167
Probably because he was so busy trying to help
me follow what was going on in the kitchen.

37:12.168 --> 37:14.008
Whatever the reason,
he wasn't doing his job,

37:14.009 --> 37:15.289
so he didn't deserve to keep it.

37:16.273 --> 37:17.793
They all think I'm here because of us.

37:22.246 --> 37:24.246
Do you think that's why you're here?

37:25.281 --> 37:26.815
No.

37:26.816 --> 37:27.916
You didn't even want me.

37:27.917 --> 37:30.786
Exactly.

37:30.787 --> 37:33.321
But you proved yourself to me.

37:33.322 --> 37:35.556
You'll prove yourself to them.

37:35.557 --> 37:37.397
They're all just gonna
look at me like I'm...

37:37.398 --> 37:37.893
Some bimbo.

37:42.664 --> 37:46.066
Look, people gossip.

37:46.067 --> 37:47.627
People get fired, some people are jerks

37:47.628 --> 37:48.868
and not everyone gets a trophy.

37:51.372 --> 37:52.872
Welcome to the real world.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.019
Hey. What happened?

38:06.020 --> 38:08.387
I gave them the money, I got a receipt.

38:08.388 --> 38:10.656
They told me that that was it.

38:10.657 --> 38:12.757
Okay, so what do we do now?

38:12.758 --> 38:15.994
Just... wait for her.

38:15.995 --> 38:18.897
I guess.

38:18.898 --> 38:21.498
I sent my mom a text saying that
we ended up eating at the place

38:21.499 --> 38:22.901
and we'd be a while longer.

38:22.902 --> 38:25.838
Thank you so much. I...

38:25.839 --> 38:30.162
I am so sorry that I got you
involved in all of this

38:30.163 --> 38:31.843
things were a lot easier in the Galapagos,

38:31.844 --> 38:33.010
Yeah.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.815
Hey.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.051
Hey! What?

38:40.052 --> 38:41.518
My God, you're all cut up.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.854
Yeah. No...

38:43.855 --> 38:46.022
I'm okay. I'm okay.

38:46.023 --> 38:48.225
- Hey. Alex.
- Yo.

38:48.226 --> 38:50.193
Thank you so much, girl.

38:50.194 --> 38:53.964
- I owe you.
- What happened?

38:53.965 --> 38:56.805
I told mouse we shouldn't have gone
anywhere near prospect, all right.

38:56.806 --> 38:58.486
I knew those guys would be looking for us.

38:58.487 --> 39:00.135
Wait. Us? You were there?

39:00.136 --> 39:01.296
Why didn't you get arrested??

39:01.297 --> 39:02.972
No, I did.

39:02.973 --> 39:05.801
Listen, thanks. You know

39:05.802 --> 39:07.642
turns out you're a lot
cooler than I thought.

39:09.746 --> 39:11.106
So z, I'll catch you later, right?

39:11.107 --> 39:11.480
Yeah.

39:15.848 --> 39:17.615
Did I just bail him out too?

39:17.616 --> 39:18.976
Did you mention that on the phone?

39:18.977 --> 39:20.852
Yeah yeah, I did. Right?

39:20.853 --> 39:22.854
I didn't? Dude, I am so sorry.

39:22.855 --> 39:24.999
Things have been so crazy in there.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.080
Anyway, you wouldn't want to leave mouse
hanging in there by himself, right?

39:28.081 --> 39:29.001
I mean, he's one of us.

39:29.002 --> 39:30.482
So where are the guys who jumped you?

39:30.483 --> 39:31.628
They're in there.

39:31.629 --> 39:32.863
Yeah, dude, we all got dinged.

39:32.864 --> 39:34.497
That's why I had to get out of there.

39:34.498 --> 39:35.778
All right, I gotta go home, man.

39:35.779 --> 39:37.199
I actually have to work tomorrow.

39:41.672 --> 39:44.007
So I need that money.

39:44.008 --> 39:46.108
Yeah. Absolutely.
I'm not skipping town, so...

39:46.109 --> 39:47.989
I'll show up for my
court date. You'll get it.

39:47.990 --> 39:49.950
I kinda need it before
the court date, actually.

39:49.951 --> 39:51.492
I need it like tomorrow.

39:51.493 --> 39:54.093
Well, if I could have gotten
together that much coin in one day,

39:54.094 --> 39:56.174
I probably wouldn't have
needed to call you, right?

39:56.175 --> 39:56.495
Zarra...

39:56.496 --> 39:58.416
Look. Listen, I'll get
together whatever I can.

39:58.417 --> 39:59.897
It's gonna be fine, okay?
I promise.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.258
We're in this together, all right?

40:01.259 --> 40:02.056
I really...

40:02.057 --> 40:04.292
One more thing.

40:04.293 --> 40:07.328
You might not wanna go around
to my side of town for a while,

40:07.329 --> 40:09.563
'cause they know your car.

40:09.564 --> 40:12.064
Not too many of those
clanging around K.C., right?

40:56.275 --> 40:57.175
Can I come in?

41:08.887 --> 41:09.686
So...

41:11.789 --> 41:14.324
I was thinking about

41:14.325 --> 41:15.959
starting up the band again.

41:19.664 --> 41:22.332
No.

41:22.333 --> 41:24.768
New people, new sound...

41:24.769 --> 41:26.169
New name.

41:32.376 --> 41:34.577
Yeah.

41:34.578 --> 41:35.478
Start over.

41:48.090 --> 41:50.425
Cool.

41:50.426 --> 41:52.293
So,

41:52.294 --> 41:54.796
I was thinking about names.

41:54.797 --> 41:57.198
Maybe,

41:57.199 --> 42:00.501
third world bus plunge?

42:03.671 --> 42:04.471
Yeah.

42:09.644 --> 42:11.445
