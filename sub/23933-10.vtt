00:10.750 --> 00:11.920
I'm Seo Hyun Soo.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.559
I want to meet you.

00:13.660 --> 00:15.889
I heard you can help me.

00:16.329 --> 00:18.030
I'm being chased now.

00:45.020 --> 00:47.660
Secretary Kim,\NI found Seo Hyun Soo.

00:49.020 --> 00:51.460
Should I handle her\Nthe same way as before?

01:01.740 --> 01:03.210
This is\NInspector Woo Sung Ha.

01:04.569 --> 01:05.569
Ms. Seo?

01:06.939 --> 01:08.410
Don't worry\Nabout anything,

01:08.509 --> 01:09.749
and talk to me.

01:11.110 --> 01:12.210
Ms. Seo?

01:16.119 --> 01:17.649
Who on earth are you?

01:27.899 --> 01:29.059
I definitely...

01:29.630 --> 01:31.399
had the ring\Nbefore we went in.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.569
What about\Nwhen you walked out?

01:34.470 --> 01:35.569
I don't remember.

01:36.140 --> 01:37.940
Are you sure\Nyou didn't get the ring?

01:39.369 --> 01:40.580
I don't remember.

01:44.610 --> 01:45.910
No way.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.179
Did you leave it\Nat a pawnshop?

01:49.179 --> 01:50.890
I said that's\Nnot the case.

01:50.890 --> 01:52.919
How can I leave\Na ring you gave me...

01:52.919 --> 01:53.960
at a pawnshop...

01:53.960 --> 01:56.289
even if I desperately\Nneeded money?

01:58.059 --> 01:59.059
You can't do that\Nbecause...

02:00.229 --> 02:01.399
I gave it to you?

02:01.399 --> 02:02.860
How can I leave it there?

02:03.199 --> 02:04.970
I need to sell it\Nat a good price.

02:06.539 --> 02:09.169
Let's go inside.\NWe'll remember something.

02:29.290 --> 02:30.689
Hello.

02:32.230 --> 02:33.629
I clearly remember.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.830
Yes, it's her.

02:39.599 --> 02:42.040
You gave the ring to her.

02:43.070 --> 02:44.439
Who did that?

02:44.640 --> 02:46.409
Just tell me.

02:46.510 --> 02:47.909
I think we have\Nour witness.

02:47.909 --> 02:49.240
Don't treat me\Nlike a suspect.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
Hey.

02:59.249 --> 03:00.420
Do you remember me?

03:01.020 --> 03:03.159
You've been here\Na few times.

03:04.230 --> 03:05.689
No, not that.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.159
It's about a ring.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.369
A ring?

03:11.129 --> 03:14.099
I think I lost\Na ring here.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.710
Have you seen it?

03:16.939 --> 03:18.710
It's in a white case.

03:19.980 --> 03:21.679
A ring?

03:23.210 --> 03:25.649
He gave you a ring,\Ndidn't he?

03:26.349 --> 03:27.719
No leading questions.

03:28.219 --> 03:29.349
I didn't give her a ring.

03:29.349 --> 03:30.589
He did give it to me.

03:32.649 --> 03:34.290
You gave it to me.

03:34.619 --> 03:36.860
What? I gave you a ring?

03:39.659 --> 03:41.460
We have evidence now.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.499
But you keep denying\Nyour charges.

03:43.629 --> 03:45.300
Why did I\Ngive you that ring?

03:48.070 --> 03:52.010
(Queen of Mystery 2)

04:01.950 --> 04:03.149
Mr. Gye.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.460
Have you read\Nthe edited story?

04:12.260 --> 04:13.260
Yes.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.099
Okay.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.269
Was there any part that\Nneeds to be fixed?

04:18.670 --> 04:19.839
Not at all!

04:20.700 --> 04:22.140
It was perfect.

04:24.070 --> 04:26.010
Everyone's saying\Nonly good things.

04:26.710 --> 04:30.950
Tell me which part\Nneeds additional revision.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.649
I feel bad that there's\Nnothing bad in it, sir.

04:36.049 --> 04:37.820
I have a meeting\Nto attend. Bye.

04:37.950 --> 04:40.289
What? Wait a moment.

04:51.669 --> 04:52.770
All right.

04:52.770 --> 04:58.409
(Restricted Area)

05:01.409 --> 05:02.710
Oh, my goodness.

05:04.609 --> 05:06.479
What brought you here,\NManager Jo?

05:06.479 --> 05:10.020
Well, it's just...\NIt's just that...

05:11.390 --> 05:12.589
I mean...

05:29.099 --> 05:34.140
(Restricted Area)

06:01.870 --> 06:03.239
Will spring come?

06:08.979 --> 06:10.680
The winter seems so long.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.120
Did the result\Ncome out already?

06:14.950 --> 06:16.120
No.

06:16.219 --> 06:18.520
I showed it to Mr. Hwang.

06:19.049 --> 06:20.419
Oh, no. Why would you...

06:22.419 --> 06:23.930
Why did you do that?

06:23.930 --> 06:26.529
He's not someone\Nwho'd read it.

06:31.299 --> 06:33.469
He was using my work\Nas scrap paper.

06:34.669 --> 06:38.039
I've reviewed it\Nfor six times.

06:38.039 --> 06:40.180
I had a hard time\Nrevising it.

06:42.239 --> 06:43.849
That's not all.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.279
He used it as a pot mat.

06:47.180 --> 06:49.080
He used it to kill\Ncockroaches as well.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.190
He even wiped windows\Nwith this piece.

06:52.190 --> 06:53.190
Goodness.

06:58.130 --> 06:59.729
And then he stepped on it.

07:03.599 --> 07:04.770
Okay.

07:05.099 --> 07:06.399
It's done.

07:10.409 --> 07:12.940
He destroyed my soul.

07:15.239 --> 07:17.549
A Pocky kiss...

07:17.710 --> 07:20.479
This was my idea.

07:23.450 --> 07:25.190
I wanted to go with\Na candy kiss,

07:25.190 --> 07:26.890
but you insisted\Non a Pocky kiss.

07:27.060 --> 07:29.859
You said a candy kiss\Nis too dirty.

07:29.859 --> 07:32.190
I had a hard time agreeing\Nto your opinion on this.

07:35.229 --> 07:37.130
I knew this was going\Nto happen.

07:37.130 --> 07:38.969
Why didn't you stand up\Nfor yourself?

07:38.969 --> 07:40.469
You should have\Ncomplained.

07:40.469 --> 07:41.870
I did!

07:50.649 --> 07:52.080
2.88g of carbon\Nare burned...

07:52.080 --> 07:54.250
to make\Njust one piece of paper.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.320
Because of this rubbish,

07:55.320 --> 07:57.190
all trees in Indonesian\Nforests are cut down.

07:57.190 --> 07:58.219
The ozone layer\Nis destroyed...

07:58.219 --> 07:59.289
due to lack of oxygen.

07:59.289 --> 08:01.989
3,000 people die each year\Ndue to extreme weather.

08:03.089 --> 08:04.529
My novel is equivalent...

08:04.529 --> 08:07.560
to some trash that causes\Nenvironmental pollution?

08:09.599 --> 08:12.399
Don't get too upset,\NManager Jo.

08:12.399 --> 08:15.399
I'll buy you\Nrecycled paper.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.680
It will decrease\Nenvironmental pollution.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.349
Oh, right.

08:28.620 --> 08:30.690
I was on my way to\Nthe interrogation room.

08:30.690 --> 08:31.690
I almost forgot.

08:38.629 --> 08:40.099
Please think carefully.

08:40.129 --> 08:41.359
Are you sure I gave\Nthe ring to you?

08:41.629 --> 08:44.900
Yes, you gave it to me\Nas you ordered the cake.

08:45.469 --> 08:47.739
You asked me to put\Nthe ring in it.

08:55.009 --> 08:56.249
Please...

08:58.280 --> 09:00.119
put this in the cake.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.280
Sure.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.849
I'll bring it\Nto your seat.

09:03.849 --> 09:04.920
Okay.

09:05.719 --> 09:08.190
I remember it was right\Nbefore the shop closed.

09:08.859 --> 09:10.129
I remember him because...

09:10.129 --> 09:11.389
there aren't many\Ndrunk customers.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.499
It seemed like he\Nwas going to propose.

09:22.739 --> 09:24.540
Were you going to\Npropose to me?

09:24.540 --> 09:26.009
Are you out of your mind?\NWhy would I do that?

09:26.009 --> 09:27.680
Why did you ask her to\Nput the ring in the cake?

09:27.680 --> 09:29.540
I was quite drunk.

09:29.540 --> 09:31.180
I wasn't sober.

09:31.749 --> 09:32.849
Forget it.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.650
Do you know what happened\Nto the ring?

09:38.589 --> 09:39.989
Well, I'm not sure.

09:39.989 --> 09:42.790
Maybe it was thrown away\Nwith the leftover cake.

09:43.290 --> 09:44.560
Thrown away?

09:46.160 --> 09:50.030
So she threw the ring away\Nwith the cake.

09:50.599 --> 09:52.170
You have no idea\Nhow much it cost me.

09:52.170 --> 09:53.599
What a waste.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.239
This is all\Nbecause of you!

09:56.239 --> 09:57.839
Why did you make me\Ndrink so much?

09:57.839 --> 10:00.509
Why did you put the ring\Nin the cake?

10:00.509 --> 10:02.109
You should have not played\Nwith food!

10:02.109 --> 10:03.680
That's why this happened!

10:19.330 --> 10:21.030
Are you done sticking your\Nphoto? Give it to me now.

10:21.030 --> 10:24.700
(Application Form for\NAdministration Assistant)

10:24.700 --> 10:26.440
Are you done?\NGive it to me.

10:27.670 --> 10:28.739
Here you go.

10:28.739 --> 10:30.310
Don't act like\Nyou're close to me...

10:30.310 --> 10:32.739
just because we work in\Nsame office. It'll bug me.

10:32.910 --> 10:35.710
Don't worry. I won't\Neven say hi to you.

10:38.410 --> 10:39.650
Inspector Woo.

10:44.050 --> 10:45.089
Ms. Yoo.

10:45.089 --> 10:46.519
It's been\Na very long time.

10:46.519 --> 10:47.820
How have you been?

10:47.820 --> 10:49.060
Yes, it's been\Na long time.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.089
I know.

10:50.530 --> 10:52.489
What are you doing here?

10:52.489 --> 10:54.330
I was appointed to\NJoongjin Police Station.

10:54.330 --> 10:56.160
I shouldn't have told her\Nabout this job post.

10:57.570 --> 11:00.469
She might tag along\Nwith him all the time.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.170
Did you find her in the\Nboarding institution?

11:04.170 --> 11:06.580
- No.\N- How did you know?

11:06.580 --> 11:09.239
Lieutenant Ha\Nis easier thank you think.

11:09.239 --> 11:10.509
His face tells everything.

11:12.180 --> 11:14.280
What are you doing here,\NMs. Yoo?

11:14.849 --> 11:17.119
I've applied for the\Nadministration assistant.

11:17.119 --> 11:19.519
Oh, you saw that notice\Non the board.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.920
The notice that was gone\Nright after it was put on?

11:22.589 --> 11:24.589
Mr. Woo, you don't have\Ntime to fool around.

11:24.589 --> 11:25.660
There are many cases\Nwaiting for you.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.129
You order\Nyour boss around,

11:27.129 --> 11:28.930
just like\Nthe rumor I heard.

11:30.099 --> 11:31.269
I like your style.

11:31.269 --> 11:33.869
You're passionate\Nand eager. That's great.

11:33.869 --> 11:36.839
Are you two\Nin the same team?

11:39.339 --> 11:41.339
Why didn't you tell me?

11:42.210 --> 11:44.280
Do I have to tell you\Nevery little detail?

11:45.310 --> 11:46.780
You must've been\Nembarrassed to work...

11:46.780 --> 11:48.119
under Inspector Woo.

11:49.379 --> 11:52.089
It's better than working\Nunder your colleagues.

11:52.089 --> 11:54.619
It seems like you two\Nhave a lot to talk.

11:54.619 --> 11:56.489
I'll get going since\NI have a lot to do.

11:56.930 --> 11:58.389
We don't have\Nanything to talk about.

11:59.290 --> 12:01.359
If you want to talk,\Nwrite me letters...

12:01.359 --> 12:02.400
or send a telegram.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.530
I'm busy too.

12:14.009 --> 12:15.239
Wait a minute.

12:17.180 --> 12:20.180
This place\Nis really dangerous.

12:20.849 --> 12:24.389
You might have\Na mental breakdown.

12:35.599 --> 12:36.700
You're here.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.070
You still look old.

12:38.070 --> 12:39.269
I heard you have\Neye problems.

12:39.269 --> 12:40.570
I heard that many times.

12:41.570 --> 12:43.469
Do you bully\Npeople here too?

12:43.469 --> 12:44.969
You had nobody around\Nto work with before.

12:44.969 --> 12:46.379
Who said such things?

12:48.339 --> 12:50.109
Have you seen me\Nbullying people?

12:50.680 --> 12:52.050
No, I haven't.

12:52.379 --> 12:56.019
By the way, are you two\Nabout the same age?

12:56.019 --> 12:58.519
Yes, we went to the same\Npolice university in 2000.

12:58.519 --> 13:00.690
- I was born in 1980.\N- Me in early 1980.

13:00.690 --> 13:02.619
- He's older.\N- He's younger.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.259
You were born in 1980?

13:09.930 --> 13:11.300
Are you sure\Nit wasn't 1880?

13:11.530 --> 13:12.869
It was 1980.

13:17.139 --> 13:18.310
Do you want some tea?

13:18.310 --> 13:19.739
I want green tea latte.

13:19.739 --> 13:21.139
1 green tea latte and 1\Nregular green tea, please.

13:21.139 --> 13:23.280
Sorry? Are you asking me\Nto get them for you?

13:23.280 --> 13:25.410
Why would you\Nmake me repeat?

13:25.410 --> 13:27.320
One green tea latte.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.320
One regular green tea,\Nhand-dripped.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.849
Yes, sir. One regular\Ngreen tea, hand-dripped.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.190
Shall we go in?

13:45.769 --> 13:47.239
You waxed the floor.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.400
You still collect\Nfootprints.

13:50.969 --> 13:52.109
Have you collected a lot?

13:52.109 --> 13:53.810
Let me have a look\Nat that database.

13:53.810 --> 13:55.080
You're wearing\Nbrand name shoes.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.450
It's a new brand.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.180
I wore them on purpose\Nfor your database.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.290
Goodness.

14:04.019 --> 14:05.719
I've never seen\Nthis kind of sole.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.519
Let my foot go, will you?

14:17.170 --> 14:18.170
Wait a second.

14:19.839 --> 14:22.839
This seems a bit\Ndifferent from others.

14:23.170 --> 14:24.969
Right? The ultralight\NEVA material...

14:24.969 --> 14:27.310
was used to\Nprevent slipping.

14:28.580 --> 14:31.479
What kind of a person\Nis your future teammate?

14:31.609 --> 14:32.950
As a profiler,

14:32.950 --> 14:35.420
I'm so curious about\Nthat person's mentality.

14:35.849 --> 14:37.889
Is she fond of\Ngetting abused?

14:39.690 --> 14:41.589
You're no wonder\Na profiler.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.290
It must take at least\Neight months...

14:43.290 --> 14:45.229
to finish\Nall the training.

14:45.430 --> 14:47.530
I'll train her by my side.

14:49.930 --> 14:50.930
Does she have\Nwhat it takes?

14:50.969 --> 14:52.229
She's got good sense.

14:53.139 --> 14:54.739
She's humorous too.

14:55.670 --> 14:56.710
Did you get it?

14:59.040 --> 15:01.580
I'm asking you\Nif you've understood...

15:02.009 --> 15:03.310
because you have to\Nunderstand first...

15:06.680 --> 15:07.979
for you to stand up.

15:15.589 --> 15:18.129
The rest is up to\Nhow I train her.

15:19.229 --> 15:20.960
Don't you work alone?

15:21.099 --> 15:22.330
I have a lieutenant\Nunder me.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.570
Oh, Lieutenant Ha.

15:23.570 --> 15:24.900
They say he was\Nappointed to your team...

15:24.900 --> 15:26.540
because everyone else\Nrejected to have him.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.300
No one applied for it...

15:28.969 --> 15:30.040
except for one person.

15:30.339 --> 15:34.080
"Recruiting members of\NViolent Crimes Unit Two."

15:34.410 --> 15:35.680
I should apply for it.

15:36.379 --> 15:39.920
The rumor says\Nthat person is Shin Na Ra.

15:41.050 --> 15:44.519
You have no one\Naround you,

15:44.519 --> 15:46.759
so how did you hear\Nsuch a rumor?

15:47.190 --> 15:49.420
I have good hearing.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.060
(Police Affairs Unit)

16:00.200 --> 16:01.339
Are there many applicants?

16:01.769 --> 16:03.910
Strangely, there aren't\Nso many this time.

16:03.910 --> 16:05.739
It got closed as soon\Nas the notice was up.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.609
When will the result\Ncome out?

16:07.609 --> 16:08.739
As soon as...

16:08.739 --> 16:10.150
the police superintendent\Nconfirms.

16:10.150 --> 16:11.150
I see.

16:11.210 --> 16:12.310
Let me know\Nthe result beforehand.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.290
Hey.

16:19.219 --> 16:20.290
Hey.

16:23.359 --> 16:25.560
Why is it so hard\Nto get in touch with you?

16:25.560 --> 16:27.200
I went on a business trip\Nto Gangwon Province.

16:27.530 --> 16:28.960
What brings you here?

16:29.900 --> 16:32.300
I'm here to see\Nmy old friend.

16:32.900 --> 16:33.900
Your old friend?

16:38.139 --> 16:39.139
Hey!

16:39.839 --> 16:41.109
- Hi, you're here.\N- Yes.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.379
- Come.\N- Okay.

16:47.349 --> 16:50.489
- He's older than you?\N- Ages are only numbers.

16:51.690 --> 16:53.790
Your office is\Non the fifth floor, right?

16:53.790 --> 16:55.759
- Let's go to my office.\N- Okay.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.960
Gosh, that old man.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.710
Oh, right. You went\Nto find the ring.

17:13.710 --> 17:14.710
What happened?

17:15.680 --> 17:17.509
It was thrown away\Nwith the cake.

17:17.509 --> 17:18.579
What?

17:21.079 --> 17:22.549
But it's strange.

17:23.690 --> 17:27.059
I clearly saw some woman\Nwearing that ring.

17:27.259 --> 17:29.090
Maybe you were too drunk\Nthat you saw it wrong.

17:29.630 --> 17:31.190
No way.

17:33.960 --> 17:34.960
Hey.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.700
You saw it when Detective\NHa and I argued, right?

17:38.200 --> 17:39.940
- Yes.\N- Why did we argue?

17:39.969 --> 17:41.969
How would I know something\Nyou don't even know?

17:46.809 --> 17:47.910
Try to remember.

17:49.309 --> 17:52.579
I remember you guys were\Ntalking about the ring.

17:52.779 --> 17:54.380
Try to remember\Nthe details.

17:57.719 --> 17:58.789
At first,

17:59.690 --> 18:02.160
Detective Ha was\Nhitting you.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.190
Spit it out!

18:04.190 --> 18:05.529
What's wrong with you?

18:05.529 --> 18:07.660
Do you really want to\Ngo to the ER?

18:07.660 --> 18:09.029
What ER?

18:09.029 --> 18:11.029
I can eat that much.

18:11.029 --> 18:12.269
You don't know...

18:12.269 --> 18:14.569
what that cake is.

18:14.569 --> 18:16.739
I know.\NIt's tiramisu cake.

18:16.739 --> 18:19.239
It might choke you\Nto death.

18:21.340 --> 18:22.340
Throw up.

18:26.049 --> 18:27.049
Is he crazy?

18:27.650 --> 18:29.950
How could he hit a woman\Nin this kind of world?

18:29.950 --> 18:32.090
Throw up already.

18:32.819 --> 18:33.920
Throw up?

18:40.799 --> 18:42.400
Did he thump her\Non the back for money?

18:42.400 --> 18:43.529
You're so cheap to me...

18:43.969 --> 18:45.229
when you're so generous...

18:45.430 --> 18:48.269
to give the expensive ring\Nto that woman.

18:49.769 --> 18:50.769
The ring?

18:51.910 --> 18:53.509
Goodness, the ring.

18:53.940 --> 18:55.509
So you were going to\Nsteal it, weren't you?

18:57.110 --> 19:00.219
What a gold digger.

19:01.249 --> 19:02.350
What?

19:03.150 --> 19:04.519
A gold digger?

19:06.759 --> 19:08.120
You're such a player!

19:08.120 --> 19:10.059
- Gold digger.\N- Player!

19:10.059 --> 19:11.059
Gold digger.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.029
That's all that happened.

19:17.430 --> 19:18.499
If that's the case,

19:18.799 --> 19:21.739
the ring didn't get thrown\Naway with the cake.

19:22.069 --> 19:23.069
What?

19:23.509 --> 19:24.969
He told me to spit it out.

19:24.969 --> 19:26.840
He meant by the ring,

19:26.979 --> 19:28.009
not the cake.

19:28.739 --> 19:31.710
He must've thought\Nthat I ate it.

19:31.710 --> 19:33.620
Didn't you swallow\Nthe ring with the cake...

19:34.019 --> 19:36.450
while you were eating it?

19:37.690 --> 19:39.289
No way.

19:39.289 --> 19:41.360
I do love cake,

19:41.360 --> 19:43.729
but I wouldn't have had it\Nwithout noticing the ring.

19:44.430 --> 19:47.430
You were drunk, so you\Ncouldn't have noticed it.

19:47.700 --> 19:48.960
While you were\Nthrowing up...

19:48.960 --> 19:50.630
in the bathroom,

19:50.900 --> 19:53.100
you could've spit\Nthe ring out too.

19:53.739 --> 19:55.999
Then you could've flushed\Nthe toilet.

19:56.309 --> 19:58.269
Isn't that why\Nyou lost the ring?

19:58.640 --> 19:59.809
Throwing up.

20:01.840 --> 20:02.880
The bathroom.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.450
Gosh, what should I do?

20:08.450 --> 20:10.950
Isn't this the bathroom?

20:11.190 --> 20:12.420
I'm sorry.

20:18.229 --> 20:19.329
That ring...

20:33.680 --> 20:35.110
I saw the woman\Nwith the ring...

20:35.579 --> 20:36.650
on my way to the bathroom.

20:37.910 --> 20:39.350
It was that ring\Nfor certain.

20:40.420 --> 20:41.420
No way.

20:41.819 --> 20:43.549
Then it's back to\Nsquare one again.

20:43.549 --> 20:46.519
Detective Ha gave the ring\Nto another woman.

20:46.519 --> 20:48.059
You're right.

20:48.489 --> 20:50.590
Gosh, whatever.

20:57.630 --> 20:59.029
You're studying the\Nhighest graduate course...

20:59.029 --> 21:00.269
of administration\Npolicy...

21:00.269 --> 21:01.469
in Joongjin University,\Naren't you?

21:01.640 --> 21:04.340
How did you know that?

21:04.969 --> 21:06.140
I saw you...

21:06.140 --> 21:07.539
while I was taking\Nthe novel-writing lecture.

21:07.539 --> 21:10.680
Do you take that lecture\Nas well?

21:11.150 --> 21:12.509
So it was you.

21:12.509 --> 21:13.880
I knew it.

21:14.479 --> 21:17.890
You married\Nthe wrong person.

21:17.890 --> 21:20.289
- What?\N- It should've been me.

21:20.519 --> 21:23.690
You and I share such\Na strong connection.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.259
I only say this because\Nmy wife isn't around,

21:28.430 --> 21:31.299
but you are my type.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.900
Oh, dear.\NWhat should we do?

21:34.700 --> 21:35.739
Come in.

21:38.009 --> 21:39.370
The recruiting deadline...

21:39.370 --> 21:40.710
for the administrative\Nposition is today.

21:43.150 --> 21:44.210
Do you have a pen?

21:44.579 --> 21:46.420
Here, I have it.

21:47.249 --> 21:48.779
- Here.\N- Oh, thank you.

21:49.690 --> 21:50.819
Let's see.

21:57.229 --> 21:58.329
Let's see.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.259
A fire broke out\Nat a sauna.

22:01.660 --> 22:02.999
Five people died...

22:02.999 --> 22:05.029
and 32 were seriously\Nor slightly injured.

22:06.269 --> 22:08.340
To be more exact,\Nsix people died,

22:08.340 --> 22:10.410
and 31 were seriously\Nor slightly injured.

22:11.309 --> 22:13.539
One more person died\Na while ago.

22:16.009 --> 22:18.650
But is it possible to\Nbe burned this much?

22:19.350 --> 22:21.150
They put out the fire\Nin an hour.

22:22.249 --> 22:24.150
It's not common.

22:25.090 --> 22:26.860
Can you confirm\Nher identity?

22:26.890 --> 22:27.890
Yes.

22:28.090 --> 22:30.930
There's a surgical scar\Non her right cheek.

22:32.660 --> 22:33.729
She did a plastic surgery?

22:36.729 --> 22:38.829
Everything is similar...

22:39.400 --> 22:41.640
from her height, her age,

22:42.400 --> 22:43.710
and her head\Nto her weight.

22:55.549 --> 22:56.549
Tell me.

22:56.590 --> 22:57.920
What are you looking for?

22:58.620 --> 23:00.319
Just because I'm stuck\Nin this autopsy room,

23:00.319 --> 23:02.120
but it doesn't mean\NI know nothing.

23:03.190 --> 23:05.860
I know that you're\Nchasing someone.

23:06.430 --> 23:07.759
What I'm looking for...

23:08.559 --> 23:09.829
isn't somebody.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.930
Then why on earth\Ndo you visit me...

23:12.200 --> 23:14.769
whenever burned bodies\Nwith a similar figure...

23:15.069 --> 23:16.239
come in?

23:16.670 --> 23:19.009
There's been an increase\Nin burned bodies...

23:19.309 --> 23:21.539
more than bodies poisoned\Nby carbon monoxide.

23:22.079 --> 23:23.850
What do you mean?

23:24.779 --> 23:26.420
To answer that question,

23:26.779 --> 23:29.620
I need to identify\Nthis body first.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.360
Okay, thank you.

23:42.130 --> 23:43.630
What did they say?\NDid you get accepted?

23:43.930 --> 23:46.100
Yes. They want me to start\Nworking from tomorrow.

23:47.340 --> 23:48.340
What?

23:48.739 --> 23:51.140
You and I will work at the\Nsame station from now on?

23:51.140 --> 23:52.809
Yes, we'll go to\Nwork together...

23:52.809 --> 23:53.910
and leave work together.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.279
It's awesome.\NDon't you think so?

23:56.309 --> 23:58.210
We worked together\Nat the side dish shop too.

23:58.210 --> 23:59.950
We went to work together\Nand left together.

23:59.950 --> 24:02.180
Yes, we did that,\Ndidn't we?

24:02.180 --> 24:03.650
Those were the good times.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.950
I couldn't get\Nused to Noryang-dong.

24:06.289 --> 24:07.360
Right.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.390
What happened\Nto the side dish shop?

24:10.390 --> 24:11.529
I left you in charge,

24:11.529 --> 24:13.360
but you only opened\Nonce every two days.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.930
How could you think of...

24:14.930 --> 24:16.499
closing it\Nfor three months?

24:16.499 --> 24:18.499
I kept getting\Ninvolved in cases.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.529
I caught...

24:19.529 --> 24:21.539
two arsonists\Nwhile you were gone.

24:24.170 --> 24:25.710
You're the arsonist.

24:26.309 --> 24:29.039
You're making me\Ninfuriated!

24:30.509 --> 24:31.650
I'm sorry.

24:31.950 --> 24:33.579
Forget it.\NI can't deal with you.

24:34.450 --> 24:36.690
I'll go to my room\Nto hide myself.

24:37.789 --> 24:40.890
You're reporting to\NDetective Ha, aren't you?

24:45.860 --> 24:47.400
I'll treat...

24:47.400 --> 24:49.870
Detective Ha to a meal\Nonce I get my paycheck.

24:50.729 --> 24:52.999
I can't believe I got\Na job at the station.

24:54.499 --> 24:56.640
It would've been better\Nif I passed the exam.

24:57.110 --> 25:00.079
I used up everything\NI had to get in there.

25:00.079 --> 25:02.140
How did I get involved\Nin another murder case?

25:06.249 --> 25:07.380
Detective Ha?

25:19.059 --> 25:20.299
What do you want?

25:21.329 --> 25:23.029
What? You made it?

25:26.370 --> 25:27.769
When do you start?

25:28.700 --> 25:29.969
Good for you.

25:51.630 --> 25:53.600
Excuse me!

25:56.200 --> 25:58.069
Hey! Excuse me.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.910
Gosh, where are\Nher manners?

26:05.910 --> 26:07.779
She closed the elevator\Nto my face.

26:08.509 --> 26:10.350
Is it too much to ask\Nto hold the doors?

26:14.719 --> 26:15.880
Ji Seung!

26:16.690 --> 26:18.789
Hey, Wan Seung.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.690
I heard you were\Nfound innocent.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.360
Do I have to find that out\Nthrough a news article?

26:24.360 --> 26:26.960
I'm sorry. I've been\Nmeaning to call you.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.529
You must've been worried.

26:28.529 --> 26:30.229
- Are you okay?\N- Yes.

26:30.229 --> 26:31.799
There was a bit\Nof a misunderstanding.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.170
Many people helped me out\Nto resolve the case.

26:35.069 --> 26:36.509
What will happen\Nto Dongban?

26:36.569 --> 26:39.779
I asked someone to take\Ncharge of the foundation,

26:39.779 --> 26:42.309
and I called for\Na board meeting too.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.910
This won't happen again,\Nso don't worry.

26:46.350 --> 26:48.380
Then I'll treat you today.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.749
Buy me a meal.

26:49.749 --> 26:51.420
Wait, what?

26:51.420 --> 26:52.620
You treating me is...

26:52.620 --> 26:54.920
not you buying me, but you\Nletting me buy you a meal?

26:54.920 --> 26:57.390
You always whined because\Nyou wanted to eat with me.

26:57.390 --> 26:58.789
My gosh.

26:59.460 --> 27:00.759
Bad news.

27:00.759 --> 27:03.370
I'm about to meet someone,\Nand she's waiting for me.

27:03.370 --> 27:04.600
Really?

27:05.900 --> 27:09.299
I lost my chance to buy\Na meal to his highness.

27:09.299 --> 27:10.940
Forget it. I'm busy too.

27:11.009 --> 27:12.840
I'm sorry.\NI'll call you later.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.440
Okay. Goodbye.

27:15.140 --> 27:16.479
Bye.

27:22.549 --> 27:24.150
Yes, I'm coming right now.

27:24.150 --> 27:26.120
I have a guest there,\Ndon't I?

27:26.420 --> 27:29.319
Yes, please show her\Nto my office. Thanks.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.729
(President Ha Ji Seung)

27:37.329 --> 27:38.700
Excuse me!

27:38.700 --> 27:40.739
Hey! Excuse me.

27:45.340 --> 27:46.579
Did he see me?

27:50.249 --> 27:52.350
I don't think he did.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.749
I'm sorry,\NI'm a little late.

27:54.749 --> 27:56.289
It's okay.

27:56.850 --> 27:58.819
I have your papers ready.

27:59.319 --> 28:00.989
You can\Njust sign them off.

28:04.090 --> 28:05.559
Take your time\Nand read it over.

28:07.229 --> 28:09.200
I'm sure you've done\Neverything well.

28:10.499 --> 28:11.729
(Accommodation Contract)

28:11.729 --> 28:13.700
(Jung Hee Yeon)

28:16.739 --> 28:17.940
A lot of people\Nget in a lawsuit...

28:17.940 --> 28:20.279
after signing contracts\Nthis easily.

28:20.279 --> 28:23.610
That won't happen\Nbetween us, Judge Ha.

28:24.650 --> 28:26.950
Right, you aren't\Na judge anymore.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.620
I got so used to it.

28:29.620 --> 28:32.150
We're all finished\Nwith our formality.

28:32.150 --> 28:34.090
Do you want to go eat?

28:34.420 --> 28:36.660
There's a great\Ntteokbokki place nearby.

28:39.029 --> 28:42.200
You're now a director\Nof Ha and Jung Foundation.

28:42.499 --> 28:44.370
Are you sure\Ntteokbokki is enough?

28:44.370 --> 28:45.870
That place is\Npretty expensive.

28:45.870 --> 28:47.469
Oh, really?

28:48.100 --> 28:51.239
Then let's go get some\Nexpensive tteokbokki.

28:51.309 --> 28:52.539
Sounds great.

28:59.479 --> 29:00.749
Here it is.

29:05.690 --> 29:07.690
Age 27.

29:08.519 --> 29:10.059
Name, Joo Hyun A.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.100
Address, Eunpyeong-gu.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.799
Are you sure\Nit's this person?

29:21.940 --> 29:23.969
Yes, it's the X-ray...

29:23.969 --> 29:25.769
of the same patient who\Ngot a cheekbone surgery.

29:28.279 --> 29:29.680
Hello.

29:31.809 --> 29:33.450
We meet again,

29:35.219 --> 29:36.620
Ms. Seo Hyun Soo.

29:51.269 --> 29:53.769
54, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul.

29:57.610 --> 29:59.579
If she lived here and\Ngot a plastic surgery,

29:59.579 --> 30:01.009
she's probably in debt.

30:01.579 --> 30:03.850
That means her looks are\Nvery important for work.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.640
Her old stuff\Ndon't look very expensive.

30:33.110 --> 30:36.079
But her new stuff\Nall look quite pricey.

30:37.410 --> 30:40.420
She must've gotten herself\Na good job.

30:49.460 --> 30:50.630
Who are you?

30:52.759 --> 30:55.029
You're trespassing, and\Nyou have your shoes on.

30:56.829 --> 30:58.469
I'm going to\Ncall the police.

31:00.069 --> 31:01.269
I'm a police officer.

31:03.309 --> 31:05.170
You almost\Nshocked me to death.

31:07.009 --> 31:08.110
But...

31:09.210 --> 31:11.549
why were you going\Nthrough Hyun A's room?

31:12.579 --> 31:13.719
Ms. Joo Hyun A...

31:14.920 --> 31:16.180
has passed away.

31:18.549 --> 31:19.590
It's right here.

31:20.289 --> 31:21.590
Did you move\Nyour office again?

31:22.259 --> 31:24.329
My neighbor's dog\Nwas too noisy.

31:24.329 --> 31:27.200
Last time, it was because\Nthey played a guitar.

31:27.559 --> 31:30.969
Information is\Nsomething very sensitive.

31:31.069 --> 31:33.569
I need a place\Nwhere I can stay focused.

31:37.910 --> 31:40.479
Gosh, he's so picky.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.190
You have\None more employee.

31:50.190 --> 31:51.420
Is she new?

31:52.019 --> 31:53.559
You take good guesses.

31:54.489 --> 31:56.259
Let's get some coffee.

32:00.529 --> 32:02.229
I haven't\Nseen this before.

32:02.229 --> 32:04.299
Did you get new equipment?

32:04.729 --> 32:06.999
I'm an early adopter.

32:08.370 --> 32:09.440
Turn it on.

32:11.870 --> 32:13.079
The recruiting deadline...

32:13.079 --> 32:14.239
for the administrative\Nposition is today.

32:14.509 --> 32:15.539
Give it to me.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.850
Do you have a pen?

32:17.850 --> 32:19.479
Here, I have it.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.880
Oh, thank you.

32:32.690 --> 32:34.860
You married\Nthe wrong person.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.400
It should've been me.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.299
You and I share such\Na strong connection.

32:41.799 --> 32:45.069
I only say this because\Nmy wife isn't around,

32:45.069 --> 32:46.809
but you are my type.

32:46.809 --> 32:48.910
I can't believe\Nhow childish you are.

32:49.850 --> 32:51.710
Not that part.

32:56.420 --> 32:57.850
Yes, Secretary Kim.

32:58.420 --> 32:59.519
On Thursday?

33:00.660 --> 33:03.630
Yes, that's fine. Okay.

33:04.890 --> 33:06.360
I'll see you then.

33:09.670 --> 33:11.200
Don't be late.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.400
What about you?

33:12.870 --> 33:13.969
I have to attend the class\Nfor the highest...

33:13.969 --> 33:15.170
graduate\Nof administration policy.

33:15.170 --> 33:16.170
What?

33:16.309 --> 33:18.170
I have to take notes.

33:18.170 --> 33:20.380
Chief Shin will\Nmiss that class.

33:20.380 --> 33:24.450
People up high love it\Nwhen you do small things.

33:25.249 --> 33:28.380
Come on, man.\NYou're clueless.

33:29.479 --> 33:31.489
But which Thursday\Nis this?

33:32.450 --> 33:34.590
Do I have to spoon feed\Neverything to you?

33:34.719 --> 33:36.690
You can find that out\Nfor yourself.

33:44.630 --> 33:48.700
What have you learned\Nwhile you worked for me?

33:48.900 --> 33:51.809
Why didn't you learn to be\Na bit more amicable?

33:51.809 --> 33:53.779
Do I have to\Nteach you these things?

33:53.779 --> 33:54.910
Bo Gook.

33:55.039 --> 33:56.749
I'm known\Nfor being amicable.

33:57.350 --> 33:59.450
There's this lady\Nwho talks a lot.

33:59.719 --> 34:01.749
She keeps saying\Nshe wants to cook for me.

34:01.749 --> 34:03.150
She keeps telling me\Nthat I'm cool.

34:03.450 --> 34:05.789
She's totally\Nin love with me.

34:09.860 --> 34:11.090
You mean Ms. Yoo Seol Ok.

34:13.299 --> 34:15.630
Are you stalking me too?

34:16.570 --> 34:19.030
Even Chief Shin knows\Nabout you two.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.440
Gosh, the coffee\Ntastes so bad.

34:24.340 --> 34:25.340
Look.

34:25.670 --> 34:27.710
I took the risk to\Nget revealed...

34:27.710 --> 34:29.210
and joined this case.

34:29.679 --> 34:31.780
If you can't get\NChief Shin on your side,

34:31.978 --> 34:33.579
I can't help you either.

34:33.579 --> 34:35.320
Don't worry about it.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.150
I'll make him\Nmy new best friend.

34:40.119 --> 34:41.590
Please do.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.570
How did she die?

34:52.369 --> 34:54.170
There was a fire\Nin the sauna.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.510
Was she burned to death?

34:57.869 --> 35:00.039
It must have been painful.

35:00.940 --> 35:02.909
Suffocation from\Npressure on neck.

35:03.749 --> 35:05.110
She died from suffocation?

35:05.849 --> 35:07.720
Somebody must have\Nstrangled her to death.

35:07.720 --> 35:08.720
What?

35:15.289 --> 35:16.460
Here.

35:21.429 --> 35:22.460
Is this Joo Hyun A's?

35:22.829 --> 35:23.869
Yes.

35:24.070 --> 35:26.670
She told me to give it\Nto the police...

35:26.900 --> 35:29.809
if something\Nhappens to her.

35:30.470 --> 35:33.309
Was she being chased\Nby anyone?

35:34.110 --> 35:37.380
She told me someone\Nkept stalking her.

35:37.380 --> 35:38.449
She said she was scared.

35:50.030 --> 35:51.760
Please tell her that...

35:52.130 --> 35:53.499
I was here to see her.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.929
May I ask your name?

35:56.199 --> 35:57.599
I'm her old friend.

35:58.729 --> 36:00.139
I was a very close friend.

36:00.269 --> 36:02.400
So your name is?

36:02.599 --> 36:04.510
Tell her I'm Seo Hyun Soo.

36:04.610 --> 36:05.610
What?

36:05.840 --> 36:08.740
It's Seo Hyun Soo.

36:09.679 --> 36:12.110
Two Seo Hyun Soos\Nare dead.

36:23.090 --> 36:25.059
Gosh. Kyung Mi is here.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.559
I forgot.

36:27.630 --> 36:29.429
I don't want to sleep\Nin the sauna anymore.

36:31.570 --> 36:32.570
Detective Ha.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.170
Why would you just leave?

36:35.869 --> 36:37.269
I have some work to do.

36:37.710 --> 36:38.809
Where are you going?

36:40.280 --> 36:41.780
I was about to\Ntake a walk.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.949
Where are you going\Nto sleep tonight?

36:48.249 --> 36:49.920
It's none of\Nyour business.

36:50.590 --> 36:51.949
I'll sleep in the\Nnight-duty room.

36:52.349 --> 36:55.389
You should get a house.

36:55.519 --> 36:57.590
You can't sleep there\Nevery day.

36:57.889 --> 36:59.090
I'll get a house soon.

36:59.090 --> 37:01.030
House prices are too\Nexpensive these days.

37:01.030 --> 37:02.530
I don't have time\Nfor house-hunting.

37:03.729 --> 37:05.369
If you are too busy,

37:05.499 --> 37:07.970
do you want me to\Ngo house-hunting for you?

37:09.710 --> 37:11.369
Why would you do that?

37:13.240 --> 37:14.539
I got a job in the\Npolice station...

37:14.780 --> 37:16.510
thanks to you.

37:16.949 --> 37:18.710
Although I'm not\Na policewoman.

37:19.449 --> 37:21.150
You'll be one soon.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.690
Just think that you are\Ndoing a field training.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.329
An accident must have\Noccurred somewhere.

37:31.559 --> 37:34.229
Accidents occur whenever\NI'm with you.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.300
What do you mean?

37:35.300 --> 37:37.300
I think it's\Nbecause of you.

37:43.269 --> 37:44.269
Stop.

37:44.740 --> 37:45.909
What happened?

37:47.380 --> 37:48.440
I'm a policeman.

37:48.909 --> 37:50.749
There was a man.

37:52.510 --> 37:54.249
- Was he a pervert?\N- Yes.

37:54.349 --> 37:55.420
Where did he go?

37:55.849 --> 37:56.849
To that way.

38:25.610 --> 38:26.619
Corporal Jang.

38:27.349 --> 38:29.380
You have to reinforce\Npatrol around here.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.289
There are so many\Nperverts around here.

38:32.650 --> 38:33.860
Mr. Jo?

38:35.519 --> 38:36.960
Don't walk around\Nlate at night.

38:38.130 --> 38:39.659
I'll get a taxi\Nif it gets late.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.429
Taxis are dangerous too.

38:41.960 --> 38:44.170
It's dangerous everywhere\Nwhere men are.

38:44.170 --> 38:45.300
Avoid them all.

38:45.429 --> 38:47.440
Then you should avoid\Nwomen too.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.440
Because it's dangerous.

38:48.440 --> 38:49.769
I'm not kidding.

38:50.309 --> 38:52.740
I'm worried about you\Nbecause you're bold.

38:53.139 --> 38:55.740
Men always think about...

38:55.909 --> 38:57.579
that thing.

38:57.679 --> 39:00.320
Simply put,\Nmen are animals.

39:00.720 --> 39:01.880
Even you?

39:02.820 --> 39:03.820
Except me.

39:04.420 --> 39:08.159
Don't treat all men\Nas potential criminals.

39:08.159 --> 39:09.659
Not all men are animals.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.260
I feel bad saying this...

39:12.260 --> 39:13.300
as a man.

39:19.099 --> 39:20.099
What's that?

39:20.940 --> 39:22.099
There's a flower.

39:23.010 --> 39:25.269
It didn't bloom yesterday.

39:26.880 --> 39:29.010
It feels like spring\Nbecause of the flower.

39:29.010 --> 39:30.010
Right.

39:31.050 --> 39:33.780
It's the season that\Nall the perverts,

39:33.780 --> 39:35.849
who hid themselves during\Nwinter, bloom.

39:35.849 --> 39:36.889
You're right.

39:36.889 --> 39:38.820
Winter is too cold\Nfor perverts.

39:39.619 --> 39:40.659
Good night.

39:41.490 --> 39:44.690
It must be uncomfortable\Nto sleep in the duty room.

39:44.690 --> 39:46.329
Do you want me to bring\Nnight snacks for you?

39:49.729 --> 39:50.999
What's wrong with him?

41:11.380 --> 41:12.449
Are you leaving already?

41:12.610 --> 41:13.619
Yes.

41:13.820 --> 41:16.420
I wanted to go out\Nsince last night.

41:16.820 --> 41:18.990
I'll go and clean up.

41:18.990 --> 41:21.360
I have to greet people\Nin the police station.

41:21.920 --> 41:22.960
Bye.

41:23.829 --> 41:24.829
Bye.

41:28.030 --> 41:29.900
I have to get ready too.

41:37.470 --> 41:38.610
Hello.

41:39.780 --> 41:41.479
Keep up the good work.

41:42.309 --> 41:43.849
Have a good day.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.949
May I help you?

41:49.280 --> 41:50.289
(Yoo Seol Ok,\NJoongjin Police Station)

41:50.289 --> 41:53.019
It's my first day here.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.519
Oh, okay.

42:09.740 --> 42:11.240
Did you just get up?

42:11.240 --> 42:12.510
Do you know\Nwhat time it is?

42:12.979 --> 42:14.479
I couldn't sleep at all.

42:14.479 --> 42:15.940
There was this guy\Nwho snored so much.

42:16.210 --> 42:17.449
I should have slept\Nin the sauna.

42:18.050 --> 42:19.050
Oh, right.

42:19.449 --> 42:20.979
It's your first day here.

42:21.249 --> 42:22.249
Yes, you're right.

42:22.749 --> 42:23.749
Are you happy?

42:24.949 --> 42:26.150
What is this? A drink?

42:27.789 --> 42:31.159
I'll share this\Nwith my team.

42:31.490 --> 42:32.789
I work here too.

42:32.789 --> 42:33.960
Detective Ha,

42:34.860 --> 42:35.860
you can have this.

42:37.829 --> 42:39.530
Thank you, anyway.

42:45.769 --> 42:47.340
How did she know ginseng\Nworks well on me?

42:47.409 --> 42:48.679
I know everything.

42:49.579 --> 42:50.579
Did you hear me?

42:51.679 --> 42:52.749
She has good ears.

42:57.889 --> 42:59.519
Why aren't you driving\Nthe car I bought for you?

43:00.159 --> 43:01.619
The alternative-day\Nno-driving system.

43:01.889 --> 43:02.889
Oh, yes.

43:03.229 --> 43:04.289
- Dad.\N- Yes?

43:04.289 --> 43:06.499
You can drop me\Nat the bus stop.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.429
I can drop you\Nat the police station.

43:08.429 --> 43:09.999
Don't get on the bus.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.900
I think people hate me.

43:11.900 --> 43:13.369
Really? Who?

43:13.999 --> 43:17.440
You know that I don't\Nget hated by people.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.510
Of course.

43:19.409 --> 43:21.110
Everyone likes you.

43:21.110 --> 43:23.050
Everyone wants you as\Ntheir daughter-in-law.

43:23.710 --> 43:26.110
So there's\Nonly one reason.

43:27.619 --> 43:29.220
I'm the daughter\Nof the chief.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.289
What?

43:31.289 --> 43:33.119
It's not like I hired you.

43:33.119 --> 43:35.159
You took the exam\Njust like the others.

43:35.619 --> 43:37.229
Did anybody say something?

43:37.229 --> 43:38.860
Who said that? Tell me.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.099
Mr. Hwang\Nfrom the forensics team.

43:43.099 --> 43:44.229
Avoid him if you can.

43:46.670 --> 43:48.800
You have no options too.

43:53.079 --> 43:54.909
I heard you applied for\NViolent Crimes Unit Two.

43:54.909 --> 43:56.550
Why didn't you apply for\NPolice Affairs Unit?

43:56.550 --> 43:57.710
I became\Na police officer...

43:57.710 --> 43:58.979
to investigate\Non violent crimes.

43:59.079 --> 44:01.679
I don't know about\Ncatching a serial killer,

44:01.949 --> 44:06.659
but I'll make sure to\Ncatch sexual assailants.

44:06.659 --> 44:09.220
Then why didn't you just\Nstay in Unit One?

44:10.829 --> 44:12.789
Because Inspector Woo\Nis in Unit Two.

44:14.099 --> 44:16.800
Be careful,\Nand don't trust him.

44:16.999 --> 44:18.670
Why?

44:18.670 --> 44:21.070
Just listen to your dad.

44:21.869 --> 44:24.369
Not a single man in this\Nworld is trustworthy...

44:24.369 --> 44:25.769
except for your dad.

44:25.970 --> 44:27.610
I know that.

44:38.619 --> 44:40.920
Dad, see you\Nat the station.

44:42.019 --> 44:43.389
Take a taxi.

44:52.099 --> 44:54.300
It must be so hard\Nfor office workers...

44:54.300 --> 44:56.940
to go to work\Nevery day like this.

45:23.429 --> 45:24.499
Who is it?

45:24.929 --> 45:26.840
Who touched my bottom?

45:30.240 --> 45:31.670
I'm a police officer.

45:32.039 --> 45:33.510
Come out right now.

45:49.389 --> 45:50.929
Why are you\Ndoing this to me?

45:52.630 --> 45:53.760
Stop it.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.550
Hi.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.849
Who is she? Oh, Constable\NShin. Good morning.

46:47.920 --> 46:50.119
Hello, sir.

46:53.789 --> 46:55.220
What's wrong with her?

46:56.119 --> 46:58.260
Why is she down\Nfrom the morning?

46:58.990 --> 47:00.729
Goodness,\Nyour startled me.

47:01.699 --> 47:03.599
What are you doing\Nin front of my office?

47:04.530 --> 47:06.300
Good morning.

47:08.240 --> 47:11.470
Sorry, I can't drink it\Nbecause of my GERD.

47:12.869 --> 47:14.380
Then drink this.

47:15.110 --> 47:16.510
It's chocolate.

47:16.510 --> 47:18.880
I might get diabetes.\NGosh.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.780
Do you have white milk?

47:21.019 --> 47:22.420
I don't.

47:22.420 --> 47:23.920
Goodness.

47:24.550 --> 47:26.619
What brings you here\Nthis early?

47:26.619 --> 47:29.630
I got a job\Nat this station.

47:29.889 --> 47:30.960
What?

47:31.659 --> 47:32.900
That can't be.

47:33.130 --> 47:35.530
I heard you failed\Nthe exam.

47:35.530 --> 47:36.929
It's the administrative\Nposition.

47:40.869 --> 47:42.970
The police superintendent\Nmustn't have permitted it.

47:42.970 --> 47:45.110
Oh, please excuse me.\NDrink this.

47:46.479 --> 47:47.809
Good morning.

47:48.079 --> 47:49.139
It's...

47:49.979 --> 47:51.880
my first day of work here.

47:51.880 --> 47:52.979
Drink this.

47:52.979 --> 47:55.780
- Did he change his mind?\N- Hold on. Drink this.

47:55.780 --> 47:56.920
Have a good day.

48:07.729 --> 48:08.729
Mr. Gye.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.670
Good morning.

48:10.829 --> 48:13.039
Constable Shin,\Ndid something happen?

48:17.639 --> 48:20.079
What are you doing here?

48:20.079 --> 48:22.309
I work here\Nin this station...

48:22.309 --> 48:23.579
as the administrative\Nofficial.

48:25.510 --> 48:27.150
The police superintendent\Npermitted it?

48:27.150 --> 48:28.780
Thank you in advance.

48:32.720 --> 48:33.990
Thank you.

48:36.729 --> 48:38.760
What about\Nsexual harassment?

48:39.999 --> 48:41.659
How did you know...

48:41.659 --> 48:44.070
that I got\Nsexually harassed?

48:47.900 --> 48:49.369
Did you really?

48:51.139 --> 48:55.440
Well, you were searching\Nthe word on the Internet,

48:55.440 --> 48:57.710
so I thought if there was\Na related case.

48:59.550 --> 49:02.179
When I was on my way\Nto work a while ago...

49:02.780 --> 49:04.119
Is this real?

49:04.619 --> 49:06.720
Who is it?\NWho did that to you?

49:06.720 --> 49:08.220
Who on earth\Ndid that to you?

49:10.190 --> 49:12.389
Where did it happen?

49:12.729 --> 49:13.960
On the bus.

49:13.960 --> 49:16.800
Well, those people\Non buses...

49:16.800 --> 49:19.130
don't get caught\Nso easily.

49:19.530 --> 49:20.800
Do you remember his face?

49:20.800 --> 49:22.170
I couldn't...

49:22.869 --> 49:24.240
see his face.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.940
There were\Na lot of people.

49:25.940 --> 49:28.579
Gosh, then we can't\Ncatch him.

49:30.210 --> 49:32.780
Sexual harassment\Nis also a crime.

49:32.780 --> 49:35.249
It applies to sexual crime\Nat crowded places...

49:35.249 --> 49:37.949
in Article 11\Nof Sexual Assault Law,

49:37.949 --> 49:39.320
(Article 11 of\NSexual Assault Law)

49:39.320 --> 49:41.159
We know that it's a crime.

49:41.820 --> 49:43.789
We're saying it's hard\Nto catch the culprit.

49:44.130 --> 49:46.329
Their wriggling\Ndirty hands...

49:46.630 --> 49:48.429
don't get caught on CCTVs.

49:48.429 --> 49:50.800
And there are\Nso many like him.

49:50.800 --> 49:53.340
The station can't function\Nif we catch all of them.

49:53.340 --> 49:54.639
Are you saying...

49:55.400 --> 49:57.340
we should continue\Nto be harassed?

49:59.909 --> 50:01.909
Why are you taking it\Nout on me?

50:01.909 --> 50:03.780
I'm just talking\Nabout the reality.

50:03.780 --> 50:05.949
You're sitting idle and\Ndoing nothing like this,

50:05.949 --> 50:08.579
and that's what\Nhas caused such a reality.

50:08.979 --> 50:11.449
The police can't fight\Nwinnable battles only.

50:11.449 --> 50:13.360
We have to start the fight\Nto even think of winning.

50:13.420 --> 50:15.389
Nothing will change\Neven if we catch them.

50:15.389 --> 50:16.889
They'll be fined,\Nand that's it.

50:16.889 --> 50:18.690
So you're not going\Nto catch them?

50:19.190 --> 50:20.929
Well, I...

50:22.030 --> 50:23.170
Seol Ok.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.199
You're an\Nadministrative official.

50:26.199 --> 50:28.800
Isn't your desk\Nover there?

50:33.139 --> 50:34.780
Who will catch them...

50:36.079 --> 50:37.349
if the police don't?

50:46.960 --> 50:49.659
They think they can catch\Nculprits as they want.

50:51.360 --> 50:53.099
That's exactly\Nhow I thought at first.

51:01.539 --> 51:02.909
Here, sir.

51:05.170 --> 51:06.309
By the way,

51:06.309 --> 51:08.809
why is Yoo Seol Ok\Nhere at the station?

51:09.650 --> 51:10.849
- Yoo Seol Ok?\N- Yes.

51:11.749 --> 51:12.749
That honorary policewoman?

51:12.749 --> 51:13.749
Yes.

51:13.979 --> 51:16.079
- She's here again?\N- Yes.

51:16.079 --> 51:18.349
Why would you ask?\NKick her out right away.

51:18.349 --> 51:20.190
Well, but...

51:20.490 --> 51:23.630
I heard you signed\Nand approved it.

51:24.329 --> 51:25.530
- I did?\N- Yes.

51:25.530 --> 51:26.530
I signed what?

51:26.530 --> 51:28.329
You signed\Nher employment...

51:28.329 --> 51:30.130
in the\NPolice Affairs Unit.

51:31.729 --> 51:33.170
I signed that?

51:33.170 --> 51:34.199
Yes.

51:36.940 --> 51:38.309
The recruiting deadline...

51:38.309 --> 51:39.610
for the administrative\Nposition is today.

51:40.909 --> 51:42.979
- Do you have a pen?\N- Here, I have it.

51:44.210 --> 51:45.510
Oh, thank you.

51:46.949 --> 51:48.150
(Police Superintendent)

51:48.949 --> 51:50.420
(Joongjin Police Station)

51:52.090 --> 51:54.190
Oh, back then.

51:56.229 --> 51:57.329
I had a guest then,

51:57.329 --> 51:58.789
so I didn't check\Nthe name.

51:59.960 --> 52:01.329
Fire her right now.

52:01.760 --> 52:03.400
Well, that's...

52:03.400 --> 52:05.199
It's a six-month contract,

52:05.199 --> 52:08.199
so it's hard to fire her\Nwithout any proper reason.

52:08.199 --> 52:10.570
And these days,

52:10.570 --> 52:12.539
we have the labor union\Nin National Police Agency.

52:12.539 --> 52:14.079
It might\Ncause you trouble...

52:14.079 --> 52:15.579
in getting promoted\Nto a commissioner later.

52:15.579 --> 52:17.880
Then make up a reason\Nto fire her.

52:17.880 --> 52:20.820
Well, but what reason\Nshould it be?

52:25.389 --> 52:28.320
I'll take care of it.

52:31.159 --> 52:32.260
Well...

52:37.530 --> 52:39.840
I'll catch the assailant\Nfor certain.

52:40.999 --> 52:44.309
I'm a policewoman and\Nan adult now, right?

52:44.510 --> 52:45.570
Of course.

52:45.570 --> 52:46.610
But...

52:47.440 --> 52:49.240
it was the same\Njust like in the past.

52:50.780 --> 52:52.309
That's what\Nmakes me so upset.

52:52.309 --> 52:54.079
Everyone gets scared\Nand flustered...

52:54.079 --> 52:56.150
in such situations.

52:56.949 --> 52:58.619
But I should have\Nbeen different.

52:58.949 --> 53:00.420
I'm a policewoman.

53:00.690 --> 53:02.860
I became a policewoman\Nto catch those punks.

53:03.590 --> 53:05.460
But I ran away again.

53:06.090 --> 53:07.760
I'm so ashamed of myself.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.769
Let's catch him together.

53:10.929 --> 53:12.400
I'll help you.

53:14.269 --> 53:15.869
Okay. Let's catch him...

53:15.869 --> 53:17.769
so that he can't do it\Never again.

53:18.740 --> 53:21.579
But how do we catch him?

53:22.510 --> 53:23.979
Every passenger who was\Non the bus...

53:23.979 --> 53:25.479
at that time can be\Ncounted as a suspect.

53:25.809 --> 53:27.079
We don't have\Nany evidence.

53:29.550 --> 53:31.249
There must be a way.

53:33.190 --> 53:34.789
When you catch drug users,

53:35.289 --> 53:37.329
do you know which method\Nis used the most?

53:37.659 --> 53:39.429
It's to lure them\Nwith drugs.

53:40.360 --> 53:41.400
Their weakness...

53:41.400 --> 53:43.030
is that they can never\Nstop using drugs.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.599
What do gambling,\Ndrug usage,

53:45.599 --> 53:47.170
and sexual assault\Nhave in common?

53:47.539 --> 53:49.340
- They're addictive.\N- Correct.

53:49.340 --> 53:50.840
Here's the special feature\Nabout addiction.

53:51.740 --> 53:53.440
When it's right in front\Nof their eyes,

53:53.940 --> 53:56.710
their bodies react first\Nlike animals.

53:56.710 --> 53:58.949
They don't care even if\Nsomeone comes after them.

53:58.949 --> 54:01.479
Then are we going to\Ndo a raid?

54:04.590 --> 54:06.820
Constable Shin,\Nyou've worked very hard.

54:07.820 --> 54:08.820
Do you have some time?

54:09.760 --> 54:10.829
Why?

54:16.199 --> 54:17.329
I got worried.

54:17.869 --> 54:19.369
I heard you had\Na lot to drink last night.

54:21.440 --> 54:24.710
All I had was\Na bottle of soju.

54:26.170 --> 54:28.440
Oh, I had three bottles\Nof beer before that.

54:29.280 --> 54:30.610
This is so pretty.

54:32.380 --> 54:34.720
That's for Chief Shin.

54:36.519 --> 54:37.690
Can you\Ngive this to him...

54:38.019 --> 54:40.690
and tell him that\Nit's from my heart?

54:42.789 --> 54:45.729
This is an expensive\Nbottle of hangover drink.

54:47.159 --> 54:48.699
You must be thirsty.\NOne second.

54:59.170 --> 55:02.340
Sir, it's Ha Wan Seung of\NViolent Crimes Unit Two.

55:03.150 --> 55:04.979
I hope your day\Nis going well.

55:05.650 --> 55:07.220
There has been some\Nmisunderstanding...

55:07.880 --> 55:09.650
between you and me.

55:10.849 --> 55:12.749
However, I... Darn it.

55:15.220 --> 55:17.760
Darn it,\Ndo I have to do this?

55:18.960 --> 55:21.059
If you can't get\NChief Shin on your side,

55:21.260 --> 55:22.900
I can't help you either.

55:28.970 --> 55:30.809
Okay, Wan Seung.

55:34.840 --> 55:36.349
I have always...

55:36.780 --> 55:38.679
looked up to you\Nwith respect.

55:39.449 --> 55:41.920
I will do my best\Nfrom now on...

55:42.519 --> 55:44.820
to not be a hindrance\Nto your future.

55:45.150 --> 55:48.090
"I will serve you\Nwith everything I have."

55:49.789 --> 55:51.960
Will you just pass it\Nonto your dad?

55:54.530 --> 55:55.860
I mean, to Chief Shin.

55:56.329 --> 55:58.829
I'm not as bad as\Nwhat the rumors say.

55:58.900 --> 55:59.900
Okay?

56:02.139 --> 56:03.210
Have some, and go.

56:03.369 --> 56:04.740
- Okay?\N- I'm fine.

56:09.139 --> 56:12.210
What do you think\Nhe means by this?

56:13.920 --> 56:16.389
"I will serve you\Nwith everything I have."

56:17.050 --> 56:18.249
It can mean...

56:18.749 --> 56:21.119
many different things\Ndepending on its nuance.

56:22.389 --> 56:23.729
For example, it can be...

56:25.030 --> 56:28.630
"I will serve you\Nwith everything I have."

56:29.099 --> 56:30.229
It's either that, or...

56:30.699 --> 56:31.900
"I will serve you..."

56:32.900 --> 56:35.599
"with everything I have."

56:35.940 --> 56:36.940
Okay?

56:37.740 --> 56:38.740
Understood?

56:39.510 --> 56:41.240
Something like that.

56:43.380 --> 56:45.179
I heard he got angry when\Nhe asked her to pass this.

56:46.210 --> 56:48.349
Maybe this is a warning.

56:49.179 --> 56:50.249
A warning?

56:50.849 --> 56:53.289
This part\Nis really ominous.

56:53.289 --> 56:56.429
"I have always\Nkept my eyes on you."

57:00.929 --> 57:01.929
Yes.

57:03.369 --> 57:05.369
He's been\Nkeeping an eye on me.

57:06.199 --> 57:09.199
What if the Inspection\NDepartment calls me?

57:09.740 --> 57:10.740
My stomach hurts.

57:13.840 --> 57:15.780
Wait, stop!

57:17.249 --> 57:18.280
What?

57:18.949 --> 57:21.150
Why did he give you\Na hangover drink?

57:21.380 --> 57:22.380
What?

57:22.679 --> 57:25.590
He knows that you got\Nbribed with drinks.

57:31.530 --> 57:35.229
I mean, why did he put\Na pink ribbon on this?

57:37.670 --> 57:39.369
He said this was\Nthe most expensive one.

57:39.769 --> 57:42.400
He's worried about you.

57:42.639 --> 57:45.269
It's odd how he emphasized\Nthat this is expensive.

57:46.240 --> 57:48.110
And he said he was\Nworried about me.

57:50.249 --> 57:52.710
He's telling you\Nnot to get in trouble.

57:53.179 --> 57:56.720
You should lie low\Nfor a while, Chief Shin.

57:59.889 --> 58:02.220
Will you please make him\Ntied up with work?

58:02.220 --> 58:03.990
Make sure he has\Nno time to do this!

58:05.159 --> 58:06.429
Yes, sir.

58:06.429 --> 58:08.999
Please excuse me.

58:10.170 --> 58:11.300
Do you want this?

58:11.300 --> 58:12.729
You can take it.

58:13.800 --> 58:14.800
Yes, sir.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:21.229
(President Ha Ji Seung)

01:00:32.869 --> 01:00:34.639
I heard you met Ms. Seo.

01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:38.479
Was she really\Nthe same Seo Hyun Soo?

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.820
Why do you ask?

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:42.380
Because Ms. Seo...

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:45.490
passed away 17 years ago.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920
What?

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.729
That means...

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:52.999
Seo Hyun Soo\Nisn't just one person.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.760
Seo Hyun Soo.

01:00:57.769 --> 01:01:00.639
I've heard that name\Nsomewhere before.

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:08.409
I envy you, stranger.

01:01:08.909 --> 01:01:10.449
You have many bodies.

01:01:12.449 --> 01:01:13.679
I'm so tired.
