WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.837
You want to throw us
a baby shower.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.474
A straight up, hard core,
dump your presents

00:06.507 --> 00:08.309
at the door, drink
too much Chardonnay

00:08.342 --> 00:10.311
and force an entire piece
of cake down your mouth,

00:10.344 --> 00:12.813
god-dang baby shower.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.015
(laughs):
Oh...

00:15.049 --> 00:16.517
What do you think, Bryan?

00:16.550 --> 00:18.686
So it's settled,
if anyone tries to force

00:18.719 --> 00:20.988
a baby shower on us, we say no.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.856
Some obligatory function
where ladies coo

00:22.890 --> 00:24.325
over knitted doodads.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.426
I'd rather go to

00:25.459 --> 00:27.561
a Terence Trent D'Arby
fan convention.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.762
Do you think they have those?

00:28.796 --> 00:30.498
Showers are so pointless.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.667
First of all, we are blessed
that we don't need anything.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.002
Second of all, we're both men.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.105
Blessed in that department, too.
Mm-hmm.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.840
The truth be told, I just don't
want to open gifts at a shower.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.843
I think a shower sounds

00:42.876 --> 00:44.345
refreshing.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.847
Rocky put me in charge of
coming up with a theme.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.016
So while reading
The Warhol Diaries,

00:49.049 --> 00:51.852
I settled for the early
'80s New York art scene.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.355
GOLDIE:
Aw, honey, you're doing
such a great job.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.624
I only wish you'd been
there to plan my shower.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.126
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:58.159 --> 01:00.294
Aw, these pictures of Reese
Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe's

01:00.328 --> 01:02.396
baby shower are adorable.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.698
Sure would love one.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.000
Oh, if you're going to the
fridge, I'd love one, too.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.071
I've gone ahead
and reserved a venue,

01:11.105 --> 01:12.140
hired a photographer,

01:12.173 --> 01:13.541
and curtained
off an area

01:13.574 --> 01:15.042
where you can eat deviled eggs

01:15.075 --> 01:16.544
in private without David

01:16.577 --> 01:18.045
lecturing you about
your cholesterol.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.414
They call them "deviled"
for a reason.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.416
Rocky, I have to say,
you are showing

01:22.450 --> 01:23.951
what some might say

01:23.984 --> 01:26.654
is an inappropriate level
of passion for this event.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.055
Well, this is not my first time.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.658
Always the showerer,
never the show-ee.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.562
(David sighs)

01:34.595 --> 01:36.230
I guess we're having
a baby shower.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.431
(all whooping)

01:37.465 --> 01:38.832
One condition though.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.000
No gifts.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.435
Oh, of course.
No gifts.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.736
All right, thanks, guys.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.905
Right.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.740
There damn well better be gifts.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.409
I want to get my "aww" on.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.178
Aww.
Aww.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.280
(both laugh)

01:55.316 --> 01:57.318
Today's baby gifts.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.187
Whoa, whoa,
what are all those?

01:59.220 --> 02:02.190
Well, this is from the sneaker
company that sponsors Sing!

02:02.223 --> 02:03.857
They sent over four pairs

02:03.891 --> 02:05.426
of their new infant
smart shoe that tracks

02:05.459 --> 02:07.628
the stride and velocity
of baby's first steps.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.597
Oh, my God, we haven't
even had the shower yet

02:09.630 --> 02:11.432
and we're barraged
with gifts.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.767
We're never gonna use
any of this crap.

02:13.801 --> 02:17.538
I mean, look at this three-piece
suit that my mom sent.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.273
What does she think-- we're
giving birth to a little

02:19.307 --> 02:21.609
Toluca Lake financial planner
who cheats on his wife?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.511
ROCKY:
You both are so ungrateful.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.313
Rocky, this room
is so packed,

02:25.346 --> 02:27.315
I couldn't even see you back
there-- what are you doing?

02:27.348 --> 02:29.450
Hooking up speakers to this
teddy bear mp3 player

02:29.483 --> 02:31.185
the crew got you,
and how dare you

02:31.219 --> 02:34.054
talk trash about
your mom's generosity?

02:34.087 --> 02:36.290
Rocky, in all fairness, we told
people to not send gifts

02:36.324 --> 02:37.491
and they keep sending them.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.059
People love buying baby gifts

02:39.092 --> 02:41.262
when they don't have a baby
of their own to buy them for.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.997
(groans)

02:45.333 --> 02:46.834
I can't believe that
we are the bad guys

02:46.867 --> 02:48.469
because we don't want
people wasting their money

02:48.502 --> 02:50.738
on stuff that we don't want
and our baby doesn't need.

02:50.771 --> 02:51.839
We got to cancel that shower.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.807
Oh, no, no, no, no--
Shania will be

02:53.841 --> 02:55.309
way too disappointed.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.844
And Rocky'll end up
back in rehab.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.479
I don't want to be
the cause of that.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.713
Again.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.218
Oh, my God,
I know what we should do.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.253
Okay, we have the shower.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.920
People can't help themselves

03:06.954 --> 03:07.988
from bringing gifts.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.823
Smile, say thank you.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.993
And then we sneak out with all
the presents and we donate them.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.662
David, you should grow
a moustache

03:14.695 --> 03:16.830
and twirl it between
your fingers.

03:16.864 --> 03:20.668
Because you are an evil
charitable genius.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.170
So, Mr. Censor Man,

03:23.203 --> 03:26.607
you're telling me that on
network television

03:26.640 --> 03:29.777
you can say the word "ass"
and you can say the word "hole,"

03:29.810 --> 03:31.945
but you can't say...

03:31.979 --> 03:33.781
Okay, calm down.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.749
Nice talking to you, too.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.050
Ass.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.920
Hole.

03:39.953 --> 03:40.921
What's up, Jane?

03:40.954 --> 03:42.189
I need to buy
the boys a baby gift

03:42.222 --> 03:44.024
and I can't think
of a thing that child needs

03:44.057 --> 03:45.526
outside of an actual mother.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.528
The official answer I've been
instructed to give is...

03:47.561 --> 03:49.863
I know, no gifts.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.132
But you and I both know
that all that means is

03:52.165 --> 03:54.201
please spend twice
as much as you planned.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.469
Well, that's in Ohio.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.705
But in L.A.
it's 20 times as much.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.275
I haven't sold a house yet
and I'm short on cash.

04:01.309 --> 04:04.645
Jane, I wasn't always
the successful producer

04:04.678 --> 04:07.114
you see towering above you
in skyscraper heels.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.882
When I first met Bryan,

04:08.916 --> 04:12.052
I had not fully
realized my potential.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.487
I recognize you.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.156
I mean, not from this
angle-- your face.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.559
You're Bryan Collins.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.228
I've seen you
in Hollywood Reporter

04:21.261 --> 04:22.963
and from that gossip
site when you were

04:22.996 --> 04:24.898
secretly dating
Ricky Martin.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.468
Perez Hilton drew
a penis on your face.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.902
Well, you're certainly
well-informed.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.070
And ambitious.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.005
I'm not gonna work
in wax forever.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.408
I want the whole package.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.909
No, no, no, not that package.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.078
I want the big career.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.348
I want a man and a child.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.682
Listen, hire me

04:41.715 --> 04:43.351
and I'll do anything.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.753
I'll work from
the bottom up.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.254
(ripping)
(yells)

04:47.287 --> 04:49.122
When you buy someone
a baby gift,

04:49.156 --> 04:51.592
you have to buy in equal
proportions as to how much

04:51.625 --> 04:52.993
you feel they
have given you.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.762
Now Bryan and David
have given me a lot.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.929
How about you?

04:55.963 --> 04:59.433
Fine, but let's go halfsies.

04:59.467 --> 05:03.036
I am so tired of poor white
people wanting handouts

05:03.070 --> 05:05.038
from hard-working
black folks like me.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.507
But sure why not?

05:06.540 --> 05:08.609
Together we can afford
something special.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.711
JANE:
A baby Mercedes.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.279
Who would buy such
a stupid thing?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.781
Harper Beckham has two.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.016
Okay, please,
just keep clicking.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.118
Oh, that little
bear suit is cute.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.553
Bear suit?

05:19.587 --> 05:22.122
That's a mink onesie.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.958
Ooh, look at
that price tag.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.027
Do you know how
many tins of hams

05:27.060 --> 05:29.029
I could send to my dad
for that money?

05:29.062 --> 05:32.299
Remember what you said about
what the boys have given us.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.134
Okay, you're right, all right.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.302
Let's buy it.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.837
I just hope some
little tree-hugger

05:36.870 --> 05:38.539
in a hemp diaper
doesn't come along

05:38.572 --> 05:40.841
and splash red finger paint
all over it.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.979
Hi, Nana,
have a pacifier.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.648
It's coated
with pixie stick dust.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.982
Pass.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.818
What the hell kind
of shower is this anyway?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.486
A fabulous one.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.021
Oh, and check out
my installation.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.323
Okay.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.592
Oh, Clay, how nice
of you to show.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.661
Well, I figured Goldie
could use someone else

06:00.694 --> 06:02.229
normal here to support her.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.665
Right, exactly the way
you supported her

06:04.698 --> 06:06.166
when you two were
still married.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.068
Yeah, exactly.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.770
Oh.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.440
I am so sorry, Rocky.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.674
No children, no children.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.776
I know the invitation
said "No kids," but

06:15.809 --> 06:17.411
my babysitter bailed on me

06:17.445 --> 06:19.212
in a text followed
by another text

06:19.246 --> 06:21.515
saying, "Did you get the weed?"

06:21.549 --> 06:24.117
Immediately followed
by a third text saying,

06:24.151 --> 06:26.620
"Oh, I'm so sorry, oops,
that wasn't meant for you."

06:26.654 --> 06:29.189
Here, let me babysit while
you go and put some makeup on.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.357
Why?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.759
I put makeup on in the car.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.861
Just do it-- you look a mess.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.363
(sighs)

06:36.396 --> 06:39.232
(whispering):
Hey, aren't you pretty?

06:39.266 --> 06:41.268
Hey.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.037
All right, all right.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.706
Everyone gather around.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.808
It's time to open presents, yay!

06:47.841 --> 06:49.376
Aw.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.044
Let's do it.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.646
DAVID: Group hug.
BRYAN: Thank you so much.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.982
Mom?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.383
Is this weird for you?

06:56.416 --> 06:58.051
You know, since you're
the one having the baby

06:58.085 --> 06:59.887
but the shower's
not really for you?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.589
Oh, not at all.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.957
I love that I get
to provide so much joy

07:03.991 --> 07:05.626
and happiness
to Bryan and David.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.461
And besides,
when you were born,

07:07.495 --> 07:09.096
Nana got me a bus pass, so...

07:10.030 --> 07:11.965
...that was pretty neat.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.301
Come on.

07:14.334 --> 07:17.337
This one is from Megan and Ian.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.839
Guys.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.674
It's a...

07:20.708 --> 07:24.812
French claw-foot baby bathtub.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.914
Aww.
Aww.
We were
just talking

07:26.947 --> 07:28.816
about this the other day.
We were?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.083
We were.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.852
We were.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.354
A Swarovski crystal-studded

07:34.387 --> 07:35.589
potty training seat?

07:35.623 --> 07:36.657
It's perfect.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.592
DAVID:
From Jonathan and James.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.760
You guys.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.529
A custom bassinet

07:41.562 --> 07:45.098
made from
New Guinea walnut.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.100
That's an endangered wood.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.536
Thank you.
Way to go.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.772
BRYAN: That's awesome.
DAVID: Thank you, guys.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.907
Thank you, Rocky.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.178
It's a mink onesie.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.347
Aw, from Rocky and Jane.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.348
It's perfect.

08:01.381 --> 08:02.716
Thank you so much.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.284
Thank you, Rocky.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.687
Oh, David, couldn't
we just keep this one?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.556
I mean, he could be...
he could be Bamm-Bamm

08:08.589 --> 08:10.057
from The Flintstones
for Halloween.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.358
Baby caveman.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.793
It'll be adorable.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.795
BRYAN:
We have had such
a fantastic time today.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.130
We really would love to thank

08:17.164 --> 08:19.466
Shania for coming up
with those whole concept.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.234
And also to Rocky

08:21.268 --> 08:23.203
for pulling this
whole thing together.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.205
Rocky, this is as
much our baby shower

08:25.238 --> 08:26.974
as it is yours.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.041
Yes, we will
cherish these gifts

08:28.075 --> 08:29.242
for the rest of our days.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.645
DAVID:
Thank you, okay.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.213
All right.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.648
Um...
See anyone?

08:34.682 --> 08:36.149
Yeah, can I help you?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.818
Hi, I'm Bryan,
this is David.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.086
Um, the thing is

08:39.119 --> 08:40.654
we got all these gifts
at our baby shower,

08:40.688 --> 08:42.923
and we already have so much,
so we were thinking...
Got it.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.825
A couple of rich dudes came here
to drop off some guilt, great.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.662
What? No, we actually were just
looking for a way to give back,

08:48.696 --> 08:50.564
you know, help the kids.
And what kid wouldn't love

08:50.598 --> 08:53.233
a fur onesie with platinum
crotch snaps, huh?

08:53.266 --> 08:54.735
(both laugh)

08:54.768 --> 08:57.004
It seems impractical, but
it's actually quite versatile.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.772
And reversible.
It is.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.840
Okay, well if Kanye and Kim

08:59.873 --> 09:01.909
decide to give up
their kids for adoption,

09:01.942 --> 09:03.410
this should be perfect.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.347
Look, I'm sorry.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.018
Really, I had three kids lose
their placement today.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.686
We appreciate
your donation, really.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.722
Let me just grab you a receipt.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.256
For your tax write-off.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.558
That's not why we're here.
Sir? Sir?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.227
Where's...
My shoes came untied.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.361
Do them.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.930
You do them, Malcolm,
you know how.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.699
The hell I do, bitch.
Hey.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.701
What are you gonna do,
tell my parents?

09:27.735 --> 09:29.903
Malcolm... I'm sorry.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.104
Are you being helped?

09:31.138 --> 09:32.405
Uh, yes the other
gentlemen was just making

09:32.439 --> 09:33.607
us feel awful
about ourselves.

09:33.641 --> 09:34.808
Oh, you met Gerald.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.476
Susie!

09:36.509 --> 09:38.879
What does the state
pay you to do?

09:38.912 --> 09:42.115
Tie my damn shoes.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.951
(laughs)
Oh, Malcolm.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.152
Um...

09:45.185 --> 09:47.154
Hi, would you just mind holding

09:47.187 --> 09:48.388
little Nikki here
for just a second?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.456
Oh, no, of course,
of course.

09:49.489 --> 09:52.159
Hi, oh! Hi.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.727
Well, hello, Nikki.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.129
Oh.
Oh, aren't you beautiful?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.799
An angel.
SUSIE:
Yeah, she is.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.134
Poor thing. We're looking
for a new home for her now.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.536
A little angel
without a home.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.774
David, I think we can do
better than just dropping off

10:06.807 --> 10:08.575
a truckload full of stuff.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.410
If y'all looking to foster,

10:10.443 --> 10:13.380
you should know I don't judge
nobody's lifestyle.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.816
What kind of car y'all drive?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.290
No, David, I'm not
saying that we should.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.858
I'm just saying what if...

10:24.892 --> 10:26.459
we adopted that
little girl?

10:26.493 --> 10:28.161
Right, but we talked
about adoption.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.930
Don't you remember
your Brangelina flowchart

10:29.963 --> 10:32.866
with the arrows and Billy Bob
and Timothy Hutton?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.468
It was a thing of beauty.
It was.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.937
And we decided
not to do that.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.538
Right, because we want
a biological connection

10:38.571 --> 10:39.773
to our child.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.774
Yeah, but, David,
look around--

10:40.808 --> 10:42.843
we have so much to offer.
(sighs)

10:42.876 --> 10:45.813
We have three cinnamons
in the spice cabinet.
(chuckles)

10:49.316 --> 10:51.685
Our child will be here
in two months.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.454
Are you starting to regret
that we chose surrogacy?

10:54.487 --> 10:55.956
No. No, no, no.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.325
I can't wait for
our baby to come.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.161
I just can't stop thinking
about that little girl, Nikki.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.864
Oh, my God,
she was so beautiful!

11:03.897 --> 11:07.200
I just wanted to bundle her up
and take her home with us.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.670
Then why don't we?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.675
What, just walk in there,
point her out and say,

11:15.709 --> 11:16.844
"We'll take that one, please"?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.678
No, I realize

11:18.712 --> 11:20.513
we're not picking out
a lobster for dinner.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.815
There's obviously gonna
be forms

11:21.849 --> 11:24.484
and evaluations,
feats of strength,

11:24.517 --> 11:26.519
a screen tests,
a chemistry read.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.355
But when it's all over,

11:28.388 --> 11:31.925
our son will have a big sister
to love and protect.

11:31.959 --> 11:35.195
And teach him double Dutch.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.031
And we will be giving
two loving parents to someone

11:38.065 --> 11:39.767
who really, really needs them.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.039
Double Dutch.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.541
(snickers)
Oh, you.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.944
A chinchilla baby bib?

11:50.978 --> 11:52.846
It goes with the mink onesie
we gave you.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.381
We forgot to give it
to you at the party.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.450
And animals were definitely
harmed in the making of this.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.453
I'm sorry.
We gave the onesie away.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.389
In fact, all the gifts
we got at the shower

12:02.422 --> 12:04.457
we donated to the Walker House.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.893
You gave away our gift?

12:05.926 --> 12:08.796
David and I so appreciate
the sentiment. In fact,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.031
you will both be getting
personalized thank you notes.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.700
Uh, off subject, Rocky,
could you please have the Sing!

12:13.733 --> 12:15.635
writers crank out some
thank you notes tomorrow?

12:15.668 --> 12:18.038
David and I have so much,
we just felt like we should

12:18.071 --> 12:19.973
share with those
who need it more.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.441
But we chose that gift for you.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.310
We put in a lot of time
and thought.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.745
Screw time and thought.
We put in cash!

12:25.779 --> 12:27.881
And who the hell do you
think you are

12:27.915 --> 12:29.649
to tell me where
my charity should go?

12:29.682 --> 12:32.085
If I want to give,
I will contribute

12:32.119 --> 12:34.888
to the leave-a-penny,
take-a-penny foundation
at my local 7-Eleven.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.790
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.426
We're just trying to do
what we think is right.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.762
Although this is
really nice.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.769
This is horse crap!
I want my money back.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.571
Now what are we gonna do?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.506
We're gonna go down
to that Walker House

12:53.540 --> 12:54.842
and take back that onesie.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.777
And we are doing it
Rocky style.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.679
*

13:05.618 --> 13:07.620
*

13:31.478 --> 13:32.812
(tapping bell)

13:32.846 --> 13:34.314
Good afternoon.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.448
I'm Rocky Rhoades,

13:35.482 --> 13:37.317
and this is my associate
Jane Forrest.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.887
An item was mistakenly
donated that belongs to us,

13:39.920 --> 13:41.154
and we're here to get it back.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.355
I'm sorry, ma'am,

13:42.389 --> 13:44.657
you can't just come in here
and take things.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.960
Why don't you just let me speak
to your supervisor,

13:46.994 --> 13:49.429
who I assume will listen
to reason because he is a man.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.200
*

13:58.538 --> 14:00.340
SUSIE:
There are two crazy women

14:00.373 --> 14:02.042
who are talking about
someone's donation

14:02.075 --> 14:04.044
that wasn't really a donation
they'd like back.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.478
SUSIE:
I don't know.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.180
(cries out)

14:07.214 --> 14:09.349
(talks indistinctly)

14:09.382 --> 14:11.018
What you here for, baby?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.452
Excuse me?

14:15.222 --> 14:16.556
How are you doing?

14:16.589 --> 14:19.192
Oh, buzz off, kid.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.828
You looking to adopt
a charming child

14:21.861 --> 14:23.696
who is a little lazy
about wiping?

14:23.730 --> 14:26.533
That is no way to
talk to your elders.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.868
And one of us is a little bit
more elderly than the other.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.204
(clears throat)
Sit down!

14:31.238 --> 14:32.572
And tie your damn shoes.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.873
Malcolm, leave
these ladies alone.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.043
The old white lady
touched my junk!

14:36.076 --> 14:38.178
Hey!
Nah, I'm just playing.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.081
I really got a lot
of people in trouble with that.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.515
You looking
for the onesie?

14:42.549 --> 14:43.583
Yes.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.218
The donations from yesterday
are in the stroller.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.587
Hope you feel good
about taking from charity.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.190
Oh, please.
I give to charity every week.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.491
It's called Medicare.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.394
Can I hold her?
Sure.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.595
Hi.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.398
Hi.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.101
Aren't you the
cutest little thing?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.203
Got it!
Found what I was looking for.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.738
I think I did, too.
(chuckles)

15:05.772 --> 15:07.574
Yeah, yeah. Here we go again.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.609
They always fall
for the damn baby.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.412
CLAY:
All right, Shania.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.713
This is your lucky day.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.617
Not only does your dad get
to babysat you,

15:17.650 --> 15:23.290
he-- and I mean, me-- is making
you his, slash, my specialty:

15:23.323 --> 15:25.792
American chop suey.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.594
Now, it's mostly
a Chinese dish,

15:27.627 --> 15:28.928
but the hot dog chunks

15:28.962 --> 15:30.297
make it American.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.632
Can I get chopsticks
and a fork, please?

15:32.665 --> 15:35.768
Hey, you're okay with the
whole baby shower thing, right?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.137
What do you mean?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.806
You know, I know you put a lot
of work into it,

15:39.839 --> 15:41.274
and your mom told me about

15:41.308 --> 15:43.776
Bryan and David giving
all their gifts away.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.278
You're not sad, are you?

15:45.312 --> 15:49.616
Are you kidding?
I'm proud of Bryan and David.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.784
In fact, I hope
that in some small way,

15:51.818 --> 15:53.153
they were influenced
by my theme.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.855
You know that attacking
consumerism was the whole point

15:55.888 --> 15:57.290
of Warhol's work, right?

15:57.324 --> 15:59.292
I thought it was just about
drugs and soup.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.795
That, too. Mom looked
a little sad, though.

16:02.829 --> 16:06.299
I guess it's kind
of weird that this is
her second baby,

16:06.333 --> 16:09.736
but she's never even had
a baby shower.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.808
Can I get some soy sauce
and ketchup, please?

16:15.842 --> 16:17.344
Yes.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.813
Oh, look, it's the fur-onesies.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.149
I know you say that

16:22.182 --> 16:24.484
to hurt our feelings,
but we kind of like it.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.520
Oh, listen, Gerald, what you
said yesterday really moved us.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.890
So we came back because we would
like to see Nikki again.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.659
We would like to be
her foster parents.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.494
Guys, this isn't like the pound.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.130
You can't just come in here
and take home a kid.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.299
There is a long
involved process

16:39.332 --> 16:40.833
to becoming a foster parent.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.636
We're not idiots, all right?
We're understand that there are

16:43.670 --> 16:46.073
forms and home visits
and that it takes a lot of time.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.208
So we would simply like
to place Nikki on hold.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.677
Wow, I'm impressed.
But the good news is

16:50.710 --> 16:52.545
Nikki's already found placement.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.716
Oh. Uh, thank goodness.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.087
We just, we just would
like her to have

17:00.120 --> 17:01.521
a couple of
really nice parents.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.690
Well, she found one.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.860
(humming)

17:18.037 --> 17:20.240
DAVID:
Oh, Rocky,
she's absolutely beautiful.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.675
Oh, thank you
so much.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.545
But if you need
to be that close
to my baby, pop a mint.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.415
Rocky, we had no idea you wanted
to be a foster parent.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.417
Well, I've been thinking
about it for a while.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.019
Taking classes and
filling out applications

17:33.052 --> 17:35.422
all with the hope of
one day being a mom.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.757
I just can't believe
you never told us.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.059
Well, to be honest,
I was afraid.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.561
Bryan, I didn't want you
to think

17:41.594 --> 17:43.062
that I wasn't putting
my career first.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.864
Oh, Rocky, no,
I am thrilled for you.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.066
And think of how
exciting this is gonna be;

17:47.100 --> 17:49.068
our kids are
gonna grow up together.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.537
Now you kids finish
your homework.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.072
And then we can watch the
premiere of season 23 of Sing!

17:53.106 --> 17:54.774
Okay, Dad.
Thanks, Mom.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.951
We just want you to know

18:04.984 --> 18:07.420
that if you ever
need any help,

18:07.454 --> 18:09.422
we are here for you.
Absolutely.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.559
You know what? I'm gonna build
a nursery on the set

18:12.592 --> 18:15.928
so you can do your work and see
Nikki whenever you want.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.964
You got it, Rocky.
The whole package.

18:17.997 --> 18:21.067
Thank you. Thank you so much.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.636
I'm gonna get Nikki home

18:23.670 --> 18:26.105
and put her to bed and watch her
sleep all night.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.640
I'll be late in the morning.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.709
So nothing's changed.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.447
You know, there were
a lot of other

18:34.481 --> 18:36.616
sweet kids there that
needed good homes.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.952
And then there's
also that Malcolm.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.131
BOTH:
Surprise!

18:52.165 --> 18:55.001
Gosh, what is all this?

18:55.034 --> 18:57.136
Wait. Did you use
all the paper towels?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.639
It's a little late, but we're
giving you a Goldie shower.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.141
Or we could just call it
a shower.
Yeah.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.543
You didn't get one this time,

19:03.576 --> 19:05.312
'cause it's not really
your baby,

19:05.345 --> 19:08.014
and you didn't get one last time
when you were pregnant with me.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.650
Shania, this is amazing.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.819
Thank you.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.221
Actually,
it was all Dad's idea.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.490
Except the black sesame rice
crackers and garlic hummus,

19:17.524 --> 19:19.326
'cause I was in the mood
for them.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.993
P.S. Those are mine,
don't eat them.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.463
I'm sorry I didn't get you
a gift, but I figured

19:23.496 --> 19:25.798
you got the best one in
the world right here.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.635
This is so sweet.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.737
If I hadn't already
cried four times today

19:30.770 --> 19:33.005
over a cat commercial,
I'd be sobbing.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.006
(whimpers)

19:34.040 --> 19:36.108
Oh, my God, there's more!

19:39.546 --> 19:42.315
Oh, good, Gerald,
you're still here.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.718
Uh, we decided we would like
to foster a child and we want

19:45.752 --> 19:47.720
to make sure you get
the commission.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.222
We want Malcolm.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.658
Malcolm?
Malcolm's my son.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.227
What?
Malcolm!

19:54.261 --> 19:55.528
What did you tell these guys?!

19:55.562 --> 19:57.330
No matter what my dad says,

19:57.364 --> 19:59.532
if you got a Latina housekeeper

19:59.566 --> 20:02.034
with a donkey bootie,
I'm available.

20:02.068 --> 20:05.405
Okay, so Malcolm's out.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.374
Doing a great job
with him, by the way.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.576
Look, there's got to be some kid
here we can make

20:09.609 --> 20:10.877
a deep personal connection with.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.013
Look, please slow down, guys.
I get you want to help.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.384
You're obviously really excited
about being parents.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.719
But why don't you wait
until your baby comes

20:19.752 --> 20:21.388
and enjoy being dads?

20:21.421 --> 20:23.256
Then we can talk about adding
another kid

20:23.290 --> 20:24.891
to your family, you know?

20:25.758 --> 20:27.894
There's got to be something

20:27.927 --> 20:29.729
we can do right now
to help these kids.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.099
Hell, yeah, make me a peanut
butter sandwich, gay.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.545
ROCKY: People say it's better
to give than to receive.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.780
Me? I love to receive.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.817
Just ask my ex-boyfriend
Darnell.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.386
It's just the things
that I've wanted

20:53.420 --> 20:56.255
to receive lately have changed.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.826
They don't come wrapped
in fancy boxes.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.895
In fact, the best gifts are
messy, loud

21:02.929 --> 21:04.797
and sometimes stink like hell.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.233
You ask me, I think the folks

21:07.266 --> 21:10.503
who give the most
are damned greedy pigs.

21:10.537 --> 21:13.773
'Cause they always end up
receiving the most.

21:13.806 --> 21:17.844
Well, that's me, I'm greedy.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.879
Because in giving,
I got it all.
