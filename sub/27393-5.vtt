WEBVTT

00:10.051 --> 00:12.470
[Alexa] Katie was working her butt off
for her London trip

00:12.554 --> 00:14.514
and I was busy with school and basketball,

00:14.764 --> 00:16.850
but we were still
in constant communication.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.311
Katie, you are the worst at costume ideas.

00:20.395 --> 00:23.231
-We are not dressing as photosynthesis.
-[doorbell rings]

00:23.398 --> 00:25.692
[Katie] Okay, okay, okay.

00:26.192 --> 00:29.362
A cup and a saucer? Mmm... no.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.241
No, a coffee stirrer
and a sugar dispenser. Gotta go.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.993
[audience laughing]

00:35.160 --> 00:39.998
At last, the college applications are in!
Caltech, UCLA, Berkeley.

00:40.331 --> 00:44.461
-And I'm now all yours.
-Oh good! You've been obsessed.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.921
But not as obsessed as your parents
with Halloween!

00:47.714 --> 00:49.549
This place looks like a haunted house.

00:49.632 --> 00:52.093
Or a Halloween store
with a super nice kitchen.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.386
[Alexa sighs]

00:53.595 --> 00:57.015
Yeah, this is like their Christmas.
They like to spread the holiday fear.

00:58.641 --> 01:01.603
[chuckles] E-mail confirmation.
Stanford got my application!

01:02.312 --> 01:05.398
Hmm. Sounds like you really got your heart
set on California.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.275
Yeah, guess I do.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.195
Maybe I'll take up surfing.
[chuckles]

01:10.653 --> 01:12.572
This guy knows what I'm talking about.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.075
[Dylan sighs]

01:15.158 --> 01:17.118
Uh, tell Katie I say hi.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.163
Sorry, we're figuring out
our combo costumes

01:20.246 --> 01:21.831
for Hannah's Halloween party.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.458
Oh, really?

01:24.042 --> 01:27.420
Because I thought we could do
a couples costume this year.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.423
You know, 'cause... we're a couple.
[chuckles]

01:30.507 --> 01:34.761
I was thinking something crazy like, uh...
Issac Newton and an apple.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.679
[laughs] That's hilarious!

01:37.639 --> 01:42.185
But you're not joking, so let me say,
you'd be the cutest Isaac Newton ever.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.687
Well, I kinda saw me as the apple.

01:46.106 --> 01:46.940
I'm sorry.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.609
Katie and I've been doing costumes
together forever.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.361
Man...

01:51.986 --> 01:55.573
you two have been, uh,
more inseparable than ever lately.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.534
No we haven't!

01:57.617 --> 01:59.786
Plus, you've been busy
with your college applications.

02:00.328 --> 02:03.665
I just mean, we haven't had
a lot of you and me time.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.792
We went on a dinner date last week.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.835
With Katie.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.336
[audience laughing]

02:08.503 --> 02:10.880
Okay,
the nachos platter is way too big for two.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.008
But...

02:14.092 --> 02:16.594
I am going to your Mathlete competition
tomorrow night.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.847
Better. It's a big one.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.849
We're up against the state champs.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.642
The Alge Bros.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.727
I wouldn't miss it.

02:25.019 --> 02:28.148
Hey! You guys want a snack?
I'm going to cut up a pear.

02:28.523 --> 02:32.318
Okay. Mom, you can't just dangle the word
"snack" and then cut up a fruit.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.779
That's a bait and switch.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.657
Ow. Oh. Yeah!

02:38.449 --> 02:40.034
I cut my finger!
[chuckles]

02:40.243 --> 02:42.620
Woo! Yeah, well, that's really coming out.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.040
-Oh!
-That... that thing is really, I mean...

02:46.541 --> 02:48.293
That's a lot of...
[gags]

02:49.252 --> 02:50.587
I think I'm gonna be sick.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.174
-[all scream]
-[guy growls]

02:54.591 --> 02:57.468
Ahh! Haha!

02:57.552 --> 03:00.972
-Oh, the looks on your faces!
-[Lori] Oh!

03:01.055 --> 03:04.225
I think we took a year off of their lives
and added it to ours.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.770
-Good one, guys.
-Oh, yes!

03:07.854 --> 03:09.439
Yeah, that was... [pants]

03:09.522 --> 03:12.442
That was really good.
Very enjoyable.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.696
Babe! I'm loving
your new fake blood recipe.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.615
Gotta try that on ice cream.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.326
You know, you're pretty handsome
with that chainsaw.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.412
Ah, you aren't so bad yourself,
Little Miss Finger Slicer.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.665
Okay, okay! You've scared us enough
for one day.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.334

[sighs] I am so excited
about your Halloween party, Hannah!

04:07.705 --> 04:09.582
-Wait, who's going?
-Everybody.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.167
Usually Missy Haberman hosts it,

04:11.251 --> 04:13.253
but since Hannah dropped her
at cheer practice,

04:13.336 --> 04:14.879
they'll all be at Hannah's.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.256
Except for Missy.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.218
This party could make or break us.
Don't screw it up.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.262
Okie dokie, Reganokie!

04:22.512 --> 04:23.388
Oh, boy.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.058
Here you go!
They take forever to make,

04:27.433 --> 04:30.895
but I'm the master
of the candy corn latte. [chuckles]

04:32.021 --> 04:36.651
Uh, yeah. Barry says it'll come right off
with some... coarse sandpaper.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.487
Oh, let's go shop for decorations.

04:39.821 --> 04:43.074
We need this party to say...
"Who's Hannah's awesome friend?"

04:43.324 --> 04:44.617
I don't know. Who?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.912
[audience laughing]

04:49.289 --> 04:50.581
So...

04:50.915 --> 04:53.293
Dylan wanted me to do a costume with him.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.503
He thinks you and I are more inseparable
than ever.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.088
Oh, that's sweet!

04:57.297 --> 04:58.923
No, in a bad way. It's--

04:59.007 --> 05:01.884
-Ridiculous. I mean, it's not like--
-We're always together--

05:01.968 --> 05:04.220
And finish each other's sentences.
[chuckles]

05:06.431 --> 05:09.851
Well, he'll forget all about that
when he sees us at the party. [chuckles]

05:10.268 --> 05:12.395
-Dressed as peanut butter and jelly.
-Yes!

05:12.478 --> 05:15.106
We're two halves
of the greatest sandwich in history.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.817
We are inseparable.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.529
But also separable.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.115
The halves can be pulled apart
if needed.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.825
Darn right they can.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.744
Though I don't think
anyone would want that.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.620
They are better together.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.626
Katie! Biffelsis.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.921
Oh, look! Lucas is taking his Gwenny
out for a walk.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.758
Hmm. The small talk portion is over.

05:42.425 --> 05:46.262
I need one decaf non-fat machiatto
with a splash of vanilla for me,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.973
and one not too hot,
hot chocolate for the boy.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.892
Burned my tongue last time.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.226
I'm a gulper.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.227
Aww!

05:55.355 --> 05:56.522
Her decaf...

05:56.606 --> 05:58.483
is going to be all caf.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.651
[audience laughing]

06:01.778 --> 06:04.364
Taking a break. You are in charge.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.115
[Katie chuckles]

06:06.199 --> 06:09.035
Fastest promotion
in the history of coffee.

06:09.118 --> 06:12.372
Yeah, I am running things around here.
[chuckles]

06:14.499 --> 06:16.292
Fifty large candy corn lattes.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.587
-Uh, fifteen?
-Fifty.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.799
The rest will be here
after they pull Janice out of the ravine.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.137
It'll take me forever
to make all those drinks.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.306
Don't worry, Peanut Butter.
Jelly's got you!

06:32.517 --> 06:34.977
[customers chattering]

06:38.022 --> 06:39.732
We have gloves?

06:44.195 --> 06:47.657
I'm sorry, Jack.
We don't say those things in this house.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.242
I don't agree.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.161
The Hulk is ten times bigger
than Superman.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.663
He'd totally win.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.666
Dude! Superman's a zillion times faster
than broccoli face.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.544
Plus, he can fly,
and he has a super-cool cape.

06:59.961 --> 07:00.795
[knock on door]

07:01.504 --> 07:03.047
That cape is key.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.133
-The cape is useless--
-[shouts] The cape is key!

07:05.258 --> 07:07.260
[audience laughing]

07:09.595 --> 07:12.056
-Weird.
-[knock on door]

07:15.476 --> 07:16.519
Watch it!

07:16.602 --> 07:17.895
I have mace in here.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.148
Somewhere.

07:22.024 --> 07:22.942
[knock on door]

07:23.234 --> 07:24.777
I have had just about enough--

07:24.861 --> 07:26.737
[screams] Ahh!

07:26.821 --> 07:30.199
[clowns screaming then laughing]

07:30.283 --> 07:32.869
Oh! Did you see that face?

07:33.202 --> 07:34.245
Are you kidding me?

07:34.328 --> 07:36.914
I wanna see that face
every time I see her face.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.542
Thought I was gonna get
my head chopped off.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.462
Funny stuff. [laughs nervously]

07:43.421 --> 07:45.256
So you really didn't know it was us?

07:45.339 --> 07:47.675
No! I thought you were depraved maniacs.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.512
-I'm certainly in the ballpark.
-[Dave and Lori chuckle]

07:51.596 --> 07:54.098
Well, we're just happy
to bring a smile to your face.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.684
Yeah, and a little pee to my pants.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.938
Uh, let's roll, Chapo.
We've got more neighbors to visit.

08:01.022 --> 08:04.192
Oh, and that sweet little retired couple
that just moved across the street.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.611
-You think they can handle it?
-We'll find out!

08:06.694 --> 08:08.112
[Dave and Lori giggle]

08:12.617 --> 08:16.579
You know, every Halloween,
those two scare the noodles out of us.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.914
This year...

08:18.498 --> 08:19.999
we're getting revenge!

08:20.666 --> 08:21.792
You with me, Jack?

08:22.043 --> 08:23.878
I used to like clowns.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.593
This two-person unicorn is adorable!

08:30.927 --> 08:33.179
I'll be the head, you can be the butt.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.307
That's the tenth costume you suggested.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.643
And every time, I'm the butt.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.145
Fine, what do you think
our costumes should be?

08:41.479 --> 08:44.148
I don't know. Something cool like...

08:44.607 --> 08:47.693
a girl robot and a burrito.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.447
This is why you'll never be the head.
[sighs]

08:51.656 --> 08:52.990
[Katie] Thanks, bye.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.244
-We did it! Up high!
-Too tired.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.037
-Down low.
-Yeah.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.832
-Okay, let's split these tips.
-Uh, no, no, no.

09:01.958 --> 09:05.378
-You're saving for London.
-I'm not taking no, no, no for an answer.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.712
You earned it.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.966
I get 33% of the tips,

09:10.049 --> 09:13.010
so we each get 50% of my percentage.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.180
This sounds like a calculator situation.
Hmm.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.183
Of course if Dylan were here,
he could just do it in his head

09:19.267 --> 09:20.768
because he's such a math...

09:21.978 --> 09:23.604
Mathletes! Dylan!

09:24.188 --> 09:25.439
[Katie] Run!

09:28.442 --> 09:29.527
Oh my God! Dylan.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.237
How late am I?

09:31.362 --> 09:33.114
Very. It's over.

09:33.322 --> 09:34.532
Crap.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.450
Well, how did you do?

09:36.742 --> 09:37.702
We won.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.453
We beat state champs.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.708
That's great!
[chuckles]

09:44.458 --> 09:46.794
[sighs] I'm so sorry.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.213
I got totally distracted helping Katie.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.007
This huge group came into Wired--

09:51.090 --> 09:51.966
Great.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.219
I won tonight, but once again
I come in second to Katie.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.512
What?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.599
I had something important to me, Alexa,

09:59.890 --> 10:01.309
but you chose Katie.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.893
So this is about Katie.

10:03.144 --> 10:03.978
No.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.730
It's about you not being there.

10:06.314 --> 10:10.151
It wasn't on purpose. She's my best friend
and she needed my help.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.486
Well... I'm your boyfriend,

10:12.570 --> 10:14.530
and these competitions are a big deal.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.491
Mathletes is going to help me
get into UCLA or Stanford.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.285
I know, I know.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.580
We wouldn't want anything getting
in the way of you surfing in California.

10:23.080 --> 10:23.998
What?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.627
Nothing. I said I was sorry.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.712
You were sorry,
when you had to get off the phone

10:29.795 --> 10:31.422
because you had to tell Katie something.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.799
You were sorry
when I wanted to take you to the movies,

10:33.883 --> 10:36.135
but you had already seen them all
with Katie.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.180
So... sorry? But...

10:39.805 --> 10:41.474
I've had it with "I'm sorry."

10:43.184 --> 10:44.935
Well, then good news.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.979
Because that was my last "I'm sorry."

10:48.356 --> 10:49.940
Alexa!
[sighs]

10:50.524 --> 10:51.692
Hey, MVM!

10:51.776 --> 10:53.444
Most Valuable Mathlete.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.780
Guys want to carry you off
on our shoulders.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.157
-[boy] Okay, okay.
-[Dylan] Yeah, yeah.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.913
It's cool, dude.
We're just gonna clap a little.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.632
Don't bother jumping out.
I know you're there.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.596
[Lori] Such a party pooper!

11:21.180 --> 11:23.432
It's not a total loss.
Lucas will be home any minute.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.769
[gasps]
Yes, that's right, he's our easy screamer!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.939
Should we squirt more blood on everything?

11:30.147 --> 11:33.109
You know the answer to that question
is always yes!

11:33.401 --> 11:34.985
Here he comes!

11:37.822 --> 11:39.949
I'm the butt, you're the butt. Ugh!

11:40.032 --> 11:41.450
Stupid couples costumes!

11:41.534 --> 11:45.162
-[clowns scream]
-[shouts] Aah! I'm too pretty to die!

11:45.246 --> 11:46.914
[audience laughing]

11:46.997 --> 11:47.957
[Lori cackles]

11:48.416 --> 11:50.292
You guys said
you weren't doing that this year.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.422
-We lied because... it's fun!
-[both laugh]

11:55.089 --> 11:56.799
You guys really enjoy Halloween together.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.470
Hmm. Maybe getting along is more important
than being a burrito.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.976
Well, that was fun till he got all talky.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.401
[soft rattle]

12:19.405 --> 12:22.575
Hey, I, uh, found your basketball hoop
in the tree.

12:22.658 --> 12:23.868
Hmm. Thanks.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.208
So, I'm...
guessing things didn't go well with Dylan.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.878
We had a big fight.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.254
Aw!

12:35.337 --> 12:38.257
He was mad that I missed his Mathlete
thing because I was with you.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.552
-Oh, no.
-But he's being totally unreasonable.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.888
He's so desperate to go to California.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.473
Why do I care what he thinks?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.017
Look, you two just need to talk this out.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.602
Don't wanna talk to him.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.687
[huffs] But he's right.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.982
Okay? If you hadn't stayed to help me,
this wouldn't have happened.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.068
-This is my fault.
-It's not your fault.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.322
Tell me you get it. It's not your fault.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.241
Yeah, I totally get it. [chuckles]

13:05.242 --> 13:08.871
Of course I get it. Why wouldn't I get it?
[laughs]

13:09.246 --> 13:11.373
Hmm. I gotta go.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.805
Oh, there you are.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.307
Not in the mood, Katie.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.893
Uh, of course.

13:34.855 --> 13:35.689
[sighs]

13:36.732 --> 13:38.609
Saw your selfie on Instagram.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.736
"Coffee for one."

13:42.446 --> 13:44.990
Whatever you're trying to do... don't.

13:45.282 --> 13:48.327
You and Alexa belong together.
You two just need to talk.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.497
It's too soon. I'm still frustrated.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.668
Okay, okay. Then how about
at the Halloween party tomorrow night?

13:56.585 --> 13:59.088
-I don't know.
-It's perfect. Okay?

13:59.171 --> 14:02.299
You'll be at a party.
Everyone's in a good mood.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.844
And before you know it you'll be like,

14:04.927 --> 14:07.221
"What Mathlete competition?"

14:08.180 --> 14:10.432
It was a super important competition.

14:10.766 --> 14:11.767
I'm just saying,

14:11.851 --> 14:14.937
I'd hate to see a stupid fight
keep you two apart.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.147
After all...

14:17.481 --> 14:19.316
Halloween is the season...

14:19.400 --> 14:20.901
of forgiveness.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.362
Well, half that made sense.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.032
Okay!
[sighs]

14:27.867 --> 14:29.827
But... I don't have a costume.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.621
Wait. I have an idea!

14:32.746 --> 14:35.291
[gasps] And it is a great idea!

14:35.457 --> 14:37.126
I mean, sometimes I get ideas,

14:37.209 --> 14:39.545
but this is an idea.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.965
Okay, I'll drop off the costume
before the party.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.550
-Okay.
-Hmm.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.510
Thanks, Katie.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.644
I'm going to get those two kids
back together. [chuckles]

14:56.020 --> 14:56.979
Who cares?

15:02.651 --> 15:04.612
[pants] Alexa?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.071
[Alexa] What?

15:09.658 --> 15:10.993
Do you mind?

15:11.076 --> 15:13.871
I'm watching videos of cats being mean
to each other.

15:14.955 --> 15:18.125
Okay, well, watch them all now
because tomorrow night is Hannah's party,

15:18.208 --> 15:21.462
-and parties have a way of--
-No, I'm not going.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.547
-Not a chance.
-What?

15:23.714 --> 15:25.049
I don't want to see Dylan.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.550
Ow.

15:26.842 --> 15:30.346
And you won't! Yeah.
Hannah said he was not going. Hmm.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.600
-Really?
-Totally. True. Really.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.270
You'll feel better if you go out,
and... have a good time.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.897
And after all,

15:40.147 --> 15:43.484
Halloween is the season
of getting your mind off things.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.777
That does make sense.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.738
Yeah, I will go!

15:47.821 --> 15:50.199
I'm not going to let Dylan
ruin my Halloween.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.994
Yeah! Keep hope alive!
See what the night brings.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.209
[Dave sighs]

16:00.626 --> 16:03.128
What? That's a lot of candy!
[grunts]

16:03.462 --> 16:05.130
We'll have so much leftover!

16:05.214 --> 16:08.217
[sighs] Well, that's why God made
pajama jeans. [chuckles]

16:09.468 --> 16:11.428
Oh! What's this?

16:11.929 --> 16:12.763
Huh.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.432
Let's see...

16:15.557 --> 16:16.892
"Dear Dave and Lori,

16:16.976 --> 16:20.396
thanks for all the Tricks and Treats
over the years. Love, Jennifer."

16:20.479 --> 16:22.106
-That is so sweet!
-Aww!

16:22.189 --> 16:24.608
-[head grunts loudly]
-[Dave and Lori scream]

16:24.733 --> 16:28.028
[Jack laughs] Now, that was funny!

16:28.112 --> 16:30.364
[yells] Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

16:31.448 --> 16:35.536
-Yes, we did it, Jack!
-Yeah, we scared the noodles out of them!

16:36.537 --> 16:38.330
[Lori and Dave chuckle]

16:38.455 --> 16:40.582
-You really got us.
-[Lori and Jennifer giggle]

16:40.874 --> 16:42.626
Usually we get you.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.504
Oh, that's a good point! [chuckles]

16:45.671 --> 16:47.923
I hadn't thought of that nonstop
for the past 24 hours.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.049
[Lori sighs]

16:49.758 --> 16:53.012
-Well, good for you.
-[all except Jack chuckle]

16:53.387 --> 16:55.723
A quick, quick question though. Uh...

16:56.223 --> 16:59.184
did you saw a hole in our table?

17:00.269 --> 17:02.271
[audience laughing]

17:04.440 --> 17:05.357
Wow!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.402
I guess I did.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.158
I just got so wrapped up in it.
I didn't...

17:15.325 --> 17:18.579
You guys just set the bar so high,
I had no choice!

17:20.748 --> 17:22.249
Such a clean cut.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.918
My grandpa would be impressed.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.296
He made this table.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.215
It's okay. Uh...

17:31.008 --> 17:33.427
because I have the piece.
[chuckles]

17:33.635 --> 17:36.180
No one will even be able to tell, look.
[chuckles]

17:37.056 --> 17:39.058
[audience laughing]

17:44.855 --> 17:45.689
See!

17:48.275 --> 17:50.944
-Good as new. [giggles]
-Yeah.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.198
-Happy Halloween!
-Yeah, free the room.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.162
Happy Halloween!

18:00.287 --> 18:01.205
[music playing]

18:01.288 --> 18:02.581
Happy Halloween!

18:02.956 --> 18:05.793
-That's not getting old at all.
-Oh, good!

18:06.418 --> 18:08.879
-Happy Halloween!
-Ugh!

18:09.671 --> 18:12.382
Oh, perfect! We're out of bowls.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.053
Hope they have cups.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.849
Interesting costume.

18:21.141 --> 18:21.975
What are you?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.061
I'm a unicorn's butt.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.272
[chuckles] Okay, I see that now.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.359
Beep beep.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.945
-Gwenny, you're--
-A girl robot.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.739
[in a robotic voice] Hello!
[giggles]

18:36.115 --> 18:37.616
I can't believe you wore that for me.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.994
And you dressed
as a unicorn's butt for me!

18:41.662 --> 18:43.539
I never thought I'd say those words.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.916
I never thought I'd hear those words.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.919
You know, even though I'm a robot...

18:49.336 --> 18:50.796
and you're a unicorn butt...

18:51.213 --> 18:52.881
we still fit together.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.634
Like a pair of scary old clowns.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.136
How are your parents?

19:00.472 --> 19:02.683
This will make sense
when Peanut Butter gets here.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.185
Happy Halloween, Jelly!

19:05.394 --> 19:07.813
-Where is Peanut Butter?
-She said she'll meet me here.

19:08.981 --> 19:09.815
Hey, guys!

19:10.607 --> 19:14.403
I decided to dress as a Master Chef.
[chuckles] See?

19:14.570 --> 19:16.989
Pot? Oven mitt?
[giggles]

19:19.741 --> 19:23.162
It's a terrible costume.
But she sells it with attitude.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.831
Oh, good! We're out of bowls.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.751
Wait, why aren't you wearing
your peanut butter costume?

19:30.377 --> 19:33.589
Because I found somebody
who wore it better.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.674
[music playing]

19:38.427 --> 19:40.012
Katie, what did you do?

19:41.889 --> 19:42.723
Hi.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.142
-Hi.
-[Katie chuckles]

19:49.146 --> 19:50.814
Do I need to do everything?

19:51.648 --> 19:54.651
Okay. Think. In life...

19:54.818 --> 19:57.237
there are things
that just belong together.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.740
Like peanut butter and jelly.

20:00.073 --> 20:04.119
So, even if Jelly missed
Peanut Butter's Mathlete competition, and,

20:04.203 --> 20:07.414
even if Peanut Butter wasn't understanding
of how much help

20:07.497 --> 20:09.208
Jelly's best friend needed...

20:10.500 --> 20:15.297
those aren't reasons to pull
a delicious sandwich apart.

20:19.426 --> 20:23.138
What a monologue. [chuckles]
There's literally nothing she can't do.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.894
-Are you done?
-Yeah! All that's left...

20:29.353 --> 20:31.355
is for you two to make up.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.690
Proceed.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.527
-That was awesome!
-Yeah.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.280
Guess I should have gone as Cupid
for Halloween, huh?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.407
The reindeer?

20:46.411 --> 20:48.622
I should have known
that Katie would do this.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.582
I'm glad she did.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.126
Yes, she's got a good heart.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.379
And she's right.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.297
We do make a pretty good sandwich.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.758
[girls] Aww!

21:02.344 --> 21:03.220
Look...

21:03.804 --> 21:06.056
I hate how things went down yesterday.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.350
Yeah, me too.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.228
Thank you for apologizing.

21:12.187 --> 21:16.400
I didn't apologize. [chuckles]
I didn't do anything wrong.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.776
[girls] Ooh.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.404
-You didn't?
-No.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.321
Are you sure?

21:21.655 --> 21:26.410
Yeah, I was at my Mathlete competition,
which you bailed on to help Katie.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.789
You're right.
I have been spending more time with Katie.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.541
And less time with me.

21:32.749 --> 21:37.004
Because you're going away to college.
And that's all you talk about.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.756
Right. I'm weirdly obsessed
with having a future.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.217
I want you to go to college.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.303
But every time you bring it up,

21:44.428 --> 21:47.597
you never talk about what that means
for us when you're gone.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.100
Well...

21:51.852 --> 21:53.186
I hadn't thought about that.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.272
Well, I have.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.357
So, what's the plan?

21:57.941 --> 22:00.193
Would we... be long-distance?

22:00.277 --> 22:02.321
Would you come back for holidays...

22:03.780 --> 22:05.365
or would we break up?

22:05.782 --> 22:07.784
-[music stopped playing]
-[absolute silence]

22:07.909 --> 22:08.827
I...

22:10.746 --> 22:11.913
I don't know.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.292
What do you mean you don't know?

22:17.044 --> 22:18.128
I don't know.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.299
[sighs]

22:24.009 --> 22:25.802
[tsks] Well, then I do know. [sobs]

22:28.472 --> 22:29.806
Are we breaking up?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.561
I guess we are. [sighs and sniffs]

22:48.283 --> 22:49.201
[Katie huffs]

22:50.077 --> 22:51.536
I'm so sorry.
