One of the reasons

this audience goes so crazy
over your act, is that it

the appearance of you at the
top was one of the great tricks.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.370

13:40.870 --> 13:42.830
of one's language, 
I think our speech ought to

13:42.830 --> 13:46.100
concatenate around
linear Lilliputian utterances

13:46.100 --> 13:49.170
when, uh, casually conversing
with others, no?

13:49.170 --> 13:52.830
- Small words.
[laughter]

13:52.830 --> 13:58.570
- Oh, hmm, uh...
Which of you had the "L?"

13:58.570 --> 14:02.170
Ah, you're first in line.
[laughs]

14:02.170 --> 14:04.100
Ah, Jonathan, would you be so
kind as to open the book

14:04.100 --> 14:06.800
to the chosen lexical sign?
- Okay.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.700
- Find the encircled word.
It's my fervent hope

14:09.700 --> 14:11.670
that through the
sesquipedalian demonstration

14:11.670 --> 14:13.800
of a frivolous con,
I've successfully rendered

14:13.800 --> 14:15.270
my intention that 
whenever possible,

14:15.270 --> 14:18.370
one should eschew obfuscation.
[laughter]

14:18.370 --> 14:21.630
What was it?
- The word is "lobster."

14:21.630 --> 14:26.270
- Word.
[cheers and applause]

14:26.270 --> 14:31.500
- Wow.
Francis, let me ask you, um

14:31.500 --> 14:35.200
I--obviously we're impressed by
the just remembering those

14:35.200 --> 14:36.930
words is quite something,
but you're a smart guy,

14:36.930 --> 14:38.300
I know that.
Your parents were both

14:38.300 --> 14:40.270
physicists, is that right?
- That's correct, yes.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.900
- How did that effect
you growing up?

14:41.900 --> 14:43.900
What kind of an influence
did they exert on you?

14:43.900 --> 14:46.270
- They encouraged, uh...
encouraged curiosity and

14:46.270 --> 14:49.000
learning as much as I could,
and basically encouraged me

14:49.000 --> 14:52.870
to do, uh, whatever I chased,
as long as I did it to the

14:52.870 --> 14:54.500
best I could.
- So they were happy

14:54.500 --> 14:56.270
that you went into magic
rather than into physics

14:56.270 --> 14:58.170
or another of the 
scientific disciplines?

14:58.170 --> 14:59.800
- Delighted.
- Yeah.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.730
[laughter]
Uh, okay, I think they've talked

15:01.730 --> 15:03.070
long enough,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.130
We're gonna go to--
let's go to Penn

15:05.130 --> 15:07.270
and ask what he thinks.
[laughter]

15:07.270 --> 15:11.270
- Well, you know, uh,
I wish I had a thesaurus.

15:11.270 --> 15:13.000
It'd be so nice
to answer you in kind.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.900
[laughter]
- Meh.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.830
- But I just don't have
a thesaurus.

15:16.830 --> 15:21.700
The book that you used
is very similar to a, um...

15:21.700 --> 15:24.700
to a book that we used
when we did the bachelor party

15:24.700 --> 15:27.830
for Steven Spielberg.
It left a big mystery,

15:27.830 --> 15:29.470
and that is
why Steven Spielberg,

15:29.470 --> 15:31.470
at his bachelor party,
would have us

15:31.470 --> 15:34.100
instead of hookers.
Which is the--the

15:34.100 --> 15:35.970
big, deep mystery
that we had there.

15:35.970 --> 15:37.400
- Sure.
- But I guess, if we really

15:37.400 --> 15:42.270
wanted to prove to you what we
think, would we be able to look

15:42.270 --> 15:45.670
at the tray and the, uh, 
Scrabble dictionary?

15:45.670 --> 15:47.000
- Yeah.
- And the tray, yeah?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.830
- Yeah, this--
- And--and--and

15:48.830 --> 15:50.770
the big tray, yeah.
- Oh, and the big tray, okay.

15:50.770 --> 15:52.130
[laughter]
- You want the table as well

15:52.130 --> 15:53.670
while you're here, man?
- The whole thing,

15:53.670 --> 15:55.330
the whole thing, yeah.
- Should I tell you

15:55.330 --> 15:57.670
may and may not examine?
- Yes. [laughs]

15:57.670 --> 15:59.630
- Um, I--I would prefer you to
take a look at that.

15:59.630 --> 16:02.170
- Yeah.
- And, uh, this dictionary

16:02.170 --> 16:07.230
is fine to look at as well.
But, uh...

16:07.230 --> 16:10.130
- Anything I've got
in my pockets is yours.

16:10.130 --> 16:15.000
[laughter]
What are you, uh...

16:15.000 --> 16:17.430
Can you give us maybe a hint
as to what you might be

16:17.430 --> 16:19.170
looking for,
without giving away too much?

16:19.170 --> 16:22.000
- Well, if what we're
looking for we can't find,

16:22.000 --> 16:26.430
we're not giving away, uh...
much there, are we?

16:26.430 --> 16:28.470
'Cause we can't find it.
- May I say,

16:28.470 --> 16:30.200
I was really hoping
you were going to go

16:30.200 --> 16:32.230
for this tray.
- Yeah.

16:32.230 --> 16:34.200
We'd like to answer you
with a trick of our own.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.970
- Please.
- Because, uh,

16:35.970 --> 16:38.370
earlier today, Jonathan--
- Yes.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.770
- Um, Andrew came to you?
- Yes, yes.

16:40.770 --> 16:42.530
- Someone came to you.
And they asked you to put

16:42.530 --> 16:44.570
an envelope in your pocket?
- Which I did.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.930
- I did not touch that envelope
since you put it in your pocket?

16:46.930 --> 16:48.530
- No.
- You have no idea

16:48.530 --> 16:50.000
what's in that envelope?
- I do not.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.770
I didn't even steam it open,
I didn't even hold it

16:51.770 --> 16:53.470
up to a light.
- And that envelope's been

16:53.470 --> 16:54.800
in your possession
since you had it?

16:54.800 --> 16:56.200
- It's right here.
- Would your reach in and pull

16:56.200 --> 16:57.600
out the envelope, please?
- Yes, I will.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.500
- Now, we could not have gotten
to that, right?

17:00.500 --> 17:05.000
We did not see this trick.
And yet, before we even saw you,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.200
that envelope that says
"Fool Us" on it was delivered

17:08.200 --> 17:10.569
to Jonathan Ross.
We're not gonna touch it.

17:10.569 --> 17:13.430
We're not gonna touch it.
Would you hand it, please,

17:13.430 --> 17:14.829
to Francis?
And Francis,

17:14.829 --> 17:16.930
would you open that envelope?
Because I think this trick

17:16.930 --> 17:20.329
is going to blow your mind.
In this envelope--

17:20.329 --> 17:23.530
no one else has touched this.
We did not see the trick

17:23.530 --> 17:26.030
before this.
Would you pull out and would

17:26.030 --> 17:30.570
you read aloud, please,
what it says?

17:30.570 --> 17:34.300
- He will fool Penn and Teller.
- Wow.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.800
[cheers and applause] 
- Nicely done.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.470
- Wow.
[cheers and applause]

17:40.470 --> 17:43.630
Perhaps Teller would like to do
the honor and present you that.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.070
How about that,
ladies and gentlemen?

17:45.070 --> 17:49.470
- Good job.
- Mr. Francis Menotti,

17:49.470 --> 17:53.830
ladies and gentlemen.
[cheers and applause]

17:53.830 --> 17:56.100
Great job.
Wow.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.470
You know, you should give me
some more of those,

17:57.470 --> 17:58.900
'cause I've got a feeling
that's gonna happen

17:58.900 --> 18:01.170
more and more often.
[laughter]

18:01.170 --> 18:03.970
That's one successful
fooler so far,

18:03.970 --> 18:06.330
can we make it two?
We'll find out when we return.

18:06.330 --> 18:08.330
Don't go away.

- Welcome back to <i>Fool Us.
</i> So far tonight one magician

18:27.830 --> 18:29.900
has fooled Penn and Teller,
and earned a trip back here

18:29.900 --> 18:31.870
to Vegas.
So let's meet our next contender

18:31.870 --> 18:34.600
and see if they are
up to the task.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.030
[explosion]
- Hi, my name is Nash Fung,

18:38.030 --> 18:40.570
and I'm from Hong Kong.
When I was in college,

18:40.570 --> 18:43.470
I studied art history,
and I just fell in love

18:43.470 --> 18:46.300
with art.
Magic is just like art

18:46.300 --> 18:48.130
because you can't do
the same painting

18:48.130 --> 18:50.370
over and over again.
It makes you become

18:50.370 --> 18:53.430
more creative.
Every artist has his way

18:53.430 --> 18:55.630
to express himself through
his piece of art.

18:55.630 --> 18:58.030
Every trick I do in my show
relates to my life story

18:58.030 --> 19:00.470
and things that I experience.
This is the first time

19:00.470 --> 19:02.670
I've performed in front of
a national audience,

19:02.670 --> 19:04.870
and I'm excited,
a little bit nervous,

19:04.870 --> 19:08.270
but overall, I'm just grateful
for the opportunity.

19:08.270 --> 19:11.800
If I can fool Penn and Teller,
I will be extremely happy

19:11.800 --> 19:14.070
because that'd be one heck
of a story to tell my kids

19:14.070 --> 19:16.200
in the future.
[upbeat music]

19:16.200 --> 19:22.670
[cheers and applause] 
- Our next performer

19:22.670 --> 19:25.500
is from Hong Kong originally
but grew up in Seattle.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.830
Which means he's super picky
about Chinese food and coffee.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.970
Will you please welcome
Nash Fung.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.170
[cheers and applause] 
- Thank you, thank you.

19:34.170 --> 19:36.270
Oh, my goodness.
Wow, this is great.

19:36.270 --> 19:40.030
Well, uh, Penn and Teller,
can I please have you join me

19:40.030 --> 19:41.370
at the table over here?
Penn and Teller,

19:41.370 --> 19:43.800
ladies and gentlemen.
[cheers and applause]

19:43.800 --> 19:46.930
Hello, nice meeting you.
Hi, nice meeting you.

19:46.930 --> 19:48.300
- Nash, very nice
to meet you, sir.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.630
- Please have a seat, yeah.
- Sure.

19:49.630 --> 19:51.030
- We're gonna do something
fun right now.

19:51.030 --> 19:53.130
Now, uh, Penn,
now that I have

19:53.130 --> 19:56.100
gained your trust,
can I see your wallet?

19:56.100 --> 19:58.170
That'd be awesome.
- Well, you know, George Burns

19:58.170 --> 20:00.730
said, "You always need to carry
your wallet on stage."

20:00.730 --> 20:02.200
That's the most important thing
in show--bu--

20:02.200 --> 20:03.900
I'm going to hand it to you?
- It can stay where you are,

20:03.900 --> 20:05.400
that's fine, 'cause I know--
- Okay.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.800
- 'Cause I need one thing
from you.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.930
Can I get your driver's license?
- Okay, sure.

20:09.930 --> 20:11.530
- Yeah, wonderful.
Because right now,

20:11.530 --> 20:14.400
we're gonna play a game with you
involving your license

20:14.400 --> 20:19.000
and memory.
This game is called

20:19.000 --> 20:21.270
"Now that I have memorized
your billing address,

20:21.270 --> 20:24.200
can I see your credit card too?
That'd be awesome, Penn."

20:24.200 --> 20:25.900
[laughter]
Can you take it out for me?

20:25.900 --> 20:27.300
- Here you go.
- I gotta show them something.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.900
Wonderful.
So, let's see there.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.630
Credit card, driver's license.
Good.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.100
So what you're looking at
right now is a crime.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.870
[laughter]
All right?

20:35.870 --> 20:37.600
Don't let it happen to you.
I'm just messing with you.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.070
Penn, keep that with you.
Now, Teller and Penn,

20:40.070 --> 20:42.470
you guys are in Vegas.
Do you go to casinos and gamble,

20:42.470 --> 20:44.870
by chance, or...?
- We're not big gamblers,

20:44.870 --> 20:47.670
but we gamble now and again.
We know what the rules are.

20:47.670 --> 20:49.270
- Wonderful.
Well, today you will gamble

20:49.270 --> 20:51.370
with these things over here.
Teller, I've got a

20:51.370 --> 20:53.500
lunch bag for you,
but don't eat whatever's inside

20:53.500 --> 20:55.330
just yet, okay.
And, uh, Penn,

20:55.330 --> 20:58.870
I have a envelope over here.
I'm gonna drop your license

20:58.870 --> 21:01.470
into the envelope,
and then we're both gonna seal

21:01.470 --> 21:04.100
the envelope together.
So, uh, can I have you

21:04.100 --> 21:06.330
pop this inside for me?
- Okay.

21:06.330 --> 21:08.800
- Thank you, thank you.
Put inside, thank you.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.300
And then we're both
gonna seal it together.

21:10.300 --> 21:13.800
So I'll go first...
and you can go second--

21:13.800 --> 21:15.830
No, don't do that, that's gross.
I'm messing with you.

21:15.830 --> 21:18.800
I'm messing with you, okay.
Now, obviously, a show this big

21:18.800 --> 21:22.330
would not be possible without
the Rio Casino and Resort,

21:22.330 --> 21:24.070
right here.
And these are the room keys

21:24.070 --> 21:26.230
for the Rio Casino and Resort.
Now, can I have you

21:26.230 --> 21:27.970
take that here,
and take that right here.

21:27.970 --> 21:31.070
And put that in the envelope,
and seal that for me if you may.

21:31.070 --> 21:32.930
And I've been staying at the Rio
the last four days,

21:32.930 --> 21:34.500
I'm telling you, 
if you've got time to

21:34.500 --> 21:36.070
come by Vegas,
make sure you come by

21:36.070 --> 21:38.700
and check out a show called
<i>Penn & Teller </i> in the evening.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.070
Just give you some love
right now, right?

21:40.070 --> 21:41.500
[laughter]
All right, thank you, thank you.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.430
All right.
Now, uh, Teller, the lunch bag

21:44.430 --> 21:46.670
over here is very important.
Can I have you go ahead

21:46.670 --> 21:49.400
and, um, unzip it,
and take out whatever's inside.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.170
And tell us what you see.
Oh, uh, tell us what you see.

21:52.170 --> 21:54.070
Sorry, Penn, yeah.
- I'll tell you what he sees.

21:54.070 --> 21:56.100
- Wonderful.
What do you see inside?

21:56.100 --> 21:58.700
- A can of cola.
- Of cola.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.270
And is there something else
over here?

22:00.270 --> 22:02.970
That would be?
Another lunch bag.

22:02.970 --> 22:04.300
Brilliant, good.
- Oh, oh yeah.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.100
And, of course, listen to it,
listen, listen, ready?

22:06.100 --> 22:08.070
[can opens]
- both: Oh, yeah.

22:08.070 --> 22:10.630
- Oh, yeah, listen to it.
Ah.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.130
Well, I'll tell you what,
though, that's one more bag

22:12.130 --> 22:13.770
over here.
Can I have you go ahead

22:13.770 --> 22:15.830
and take it out,
and show Penn

22:15.830 --> 22:18.930
whatever you see inside?
Go for it.

22:18.930 --> 22:21.200
What do you see inside?
You see--ooh.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.530
- Lighter fluid.
- Lighter fluid.

22:22.530 --> 22:24.470
And then you got a--
- both: Bowl.

22:24.470 --> 22:26.030
- Brilliant, good.
Now, Penn, remember

22:26.030 --> 22:28.930
in the beginning, I told you
that this trick involves

22:28.930 --> 22:31.170
your license and memory, right?
- Mm-hmm.

22:31.170 --> 22:34.530

which envelope has your license?

22:34.530 --> 22:36.430
- Yes, the first one.
- The first one, okay.

22:36.430 --> 22:37.800
[laughter]
Are you sure?

22:37.800 --> 22:39.770
- No, I'm just saying it was
the first one we put it in.

22:39.770 --> 22:41.200
- Oh, brilliant.
- Now you've mixed them up.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.600

brilliant, um...

22:42.600 --> 22:44.800
Are you a little bit nervous
right now, Penn?

22:44.800 --> 22:46.470
- Uh, yeah.
- Well, you know what,

22:46.470 --> 22:48.300
you shouldn't be.
Because I know exactly

22:48.300 --> 22:50.870
which envelope has your license.
- Good.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.530
- And I know you're
not a mind reader,

22:52.530 --> 22:55.100
but just pretend that,
in case you can read my mind...

22:55.100 --> 22:56.470
- Okay.
- I'm going to think

22:56.470 --> 22:58.230
of the license that has--
I mean the envelope that has

22:58.230 --> 22:59.570
the license over here.
- Okay.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.670
- And you're going to tell me
which one has the license.

23:01.670 --> 23:03.730
Is it number one, two, or three?
Tell me, Penn.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.200
- One.
- One.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.730
So, one will stay right here.
- Good thinking.

23:08.730 --> 23:12.070
- Two and three will go
straight into the bowl.

23:12.070 --> 23:14.000
- Good.
- And I think you know

23:14.000 --> 23:18.230
what's coming next, Teller.
I'm going to bet my confidence

23:18.230 --> 23:21.470
in your mind-reading power
with your license over here.

23:21.470 --> 23:23.300
- Yeah.
- Check this out.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.630
This is the fun part
right now, Penn.

23:24.630 --> 23:26.970
- Saw you called that
"you betting," but okay.

23:26.970 --> 23:30.370
- Penn and Teller, be careful.
One, two, and three.

23:30.370 --> 23:32.370
That's really big.
All right, tell you what,

23:32.370 --> 23:34.930
Uh, Penn, for the first time,
go ahead and take, like,

23:34.930 --> 23:37.130
the envelope over here.
Tear it open and show us

23:37.130 --> 23:38.900
that is, indeed, your license
over here.

23:38.900 --> 23:43.370

- You've done that?

24:05.630 --> 24:07.700
- I'm so sorry.
[laughter]

24:07.700 --> 24:09.730
Oh, my God.
- A lot of rage at the DMV,

24:09.730 --> 24:11.430
you know?
A lot of rage.

24:11.430 --> 24:13.270
- Teller, I'm--
I marked the envelope.

24:13.270 --> 24:14.800
I trust you,
you see the mark right there?

24:14.800 --> 24:17.430
That was what I marked, uh...
[sighs]

24:17.430 --> 24:19.670
Well, I'll tell you what,
though, cola is really good at

24:19.670 --> 24:24.300
removing burn marks from cards.
So if I put enough cola

24:24.300 --> 24:27.370
in the license,
I'm sure somehow the cola

24:27.370 --> 24:30.900
I think I should be able to--
Uh-oh.

24:30.900 --> 24:34.500

24:34.500 --> 24:37.130
Guys, can you hear something
rattling in the can here?

24:37.130 --> 24:38.500
You heard it, yeah?
- I do.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.300
- Hold on a second,
there's something in here.

24:40.300 --> 24:43.330
I'm going to just, um, 
cut this open.

24:43.330 --> 24:45.500

Inside the can over here,

24:45.500 --> 24:47.900

Oh, this is crazy.

24:47.900 --> 24:51.330
Teller and Penn, do you see
something inside the can here?

24:51.330 --> 24:54.470
You saw it, yeah?
Okay, and it is actually a

24:54.470 --> 24:57.630
driver's license that's
soaked wet with soda.

24:57.630 --> 25:00.330
Penn, can I have you
go take it out and show us.

25:00.330 --> 25:02.030
Is that your license over here,
my friend?

25:02.030 --> 25:03.900
- That is my...
- That's yours right here.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.370

- Sweet!

25:14.370 --> 25:16.170

Thank you so much.

how it's done.
We'll find out whether the

While you're over here,

25:31.030 --> 25:33.370
when did you begin to do magic?
Was it in Hong Kong that you

25:33.370 --> 25:35.200
started, or did you start
when you came to the USA?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.170
- Well, I started when
I first came to America, yeah.

25:37.170 --> 25:39.830
I was 14 years old, you know,
freshman in high school,

25:39.830 --> 25:42.370
didn't want to be the outsider.
So, you know, I learned magic

25:42.370 --> 25:43.870
to fit in basically.
- You ever met

25:43.870 --> 25:47.170
any girls that way?
- Uh, yeah, recently, yeah.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.500
- Wow.
- [laughs softly]

25:48.500 --> 25:50.470
My girlfriend for three years
now, she's watching right now,

25:50.470 --> 25:51.870
so I can say it.
- Well that doesn't mean

25:51.870 --> 25:53.630
you can't still meet a new one.
Well, let's move on.

25:53.630 --> 25:56.600
[laughter]
So I think the guys are ready.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.270
Penn, tell us, do you think, uh,
you know how it was done?

25:59.270 --> 26:04.100
- Well, you know, uh, boy.
I like a, uh, borrowed object

26:04.100 --> 26:05.870
in an impossible location,
something we've done

26:05.870 --> 26:07.830
an awful lot of times.
And I want to tell you,

26:07.830 --> 26:11.630
that my driver's license here,
which I'm very glad that Nevada

26:11.630 --> 26:15.430
has the driver's licenses 
that are completely laminated.

26:15.430 --> 26:18.370
Because this was
actually in Coca-Cola.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.500
And you know, you might
have noticed this,

26:20.500 --> 26:22.970
but when I got it back,
and it had the sweet Coca-Cola

26:22.970 --> 26:25.500
on it, I lapped it.
Did you notice that?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.630
- I didn't notice that, no.
- With my tongue, I lapped it,

26:27.630 --> 26:29.030
- Okay.
- I did some lapping,

26:29.030 --> 26:31.070
- Okay, okay, okay. [laughs]
- Like that.

26:31.070 --> 26:33.270
I lapped it.
- Gotcha.

26:33.270 --> 26:35.770
- And also, your little ad
for Coca-Cola?

26:35.770 --> 26:37.530
- Uh-huh.
- I gotta tell you,

26:37.530 --> 26:39.800
having one can of Coke
is fabulous.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.930
- That's true.
- Having two cans of Coke,

26:41.930 --> 26:44.070
even better.
- Definitely.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.570
- The more cans you have, 
the better the whole thing is.

26:46.570 --> 26:48.170
- Yup.
- I love this routine.

26:48.170 --> 26:50.800
It was just terrific.

This is awesome.
Wow, okay.

- Are you confident he knows

26:57.230 --> 27:00.730
what happened there?
- You know, all I gotta say is

27:00.730 --> 27:03.270
uh, I never thought I'd be
performing onstage for you guys,

27:03.270 --> 27:04.930
so it was just--
- You're great,

27:04.930 --> 27:06.270

32:33.170 --> 32:36.070
Penn and Teller?
- Uh, I--I tried my best.

32:36.070 --> 32:37.500
- Okay.
- We'll see what we could do.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.830
- But it was great.
We loved it, didn't we,

32:38.830 --> 32:40.500
ladies and gentlemen?
- Thank you.

32:40.500 --> 32:44.700
[cheers and applause] 
- Fellas?

32:44.700 --> 32:46.930
Your verdict, please.
- Well, you know, uh,

32:46.930 --> 32:53.030
when Teller was about your age,
he did a routine

32:53.030 --> 32:55.230
very similar to that.
- Ah.

32:55.230 --> 32:57.030
- And both of us,
which is very rare,

32:57.030 --> 33:00.800
we don't agree on very much,
we both like rope tricks.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.530
We both like them
very, very much.

33:02.530 --> 33:06.830
The tricks were really good
and really wonderful.

33:06.830 --> 33:09.300
- Thank you.
- We enjoyed the most,

33:09.300 --> 33:14.070
was your personality.
Which is really, uh...

33:14.070 --> 33:17.730
magnetic.
You have a magnetic personality

33:17.730 --> 33:21.300
that really kept us entranced
for the whole thing.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.700
And although you had
a magnetic personality,

33:23.700 --> 33:25.170
I don't think
you quite fooled us.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.270
[laughter]
But it was a wonderful routine.

33:27.270 --> 33:28.630
- Well, thank you very much.
I appreciated

33:28.630 --> 33:29.970
performing for you.
Thank you.

33:29.970 --> 33:31.300
[cheers and applause] 
- Let me check then,

33:31.300 --> 33:35.370
because they speak in code.
None of us are actually

33:35.370 --> 33:36.770
quite sure what was
just said there,

33:36.770 --> 33:39.170
but you're happy
that Penn and Teller know

33:39.170 --> 33:40.570
what they're talking about?
- I did not fool them.

33:40.570 --> 33:42.130
- You did not fool them.
Well, we had a great time

33:42.130 --> 33:43.530
watching you, didn't we,
ladies and gentlemen?

33:43.530 --> 33:44.870
[cheers and applause] 
It was fabulous, Chad.

33:44.870 --> 33:46.300
- Thank you.
- Keep doing the

33:46.300 --> 33:47.630
good work as well.
Chad Juros,

33:47.630 --> 33:49.130
ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you.

33:49.130 --> 33:53.300
- Very talented young man.
[cheers and applause]

33:53.300 --> 33:55.670
Coming up after the break,
a performance from the

33:55.670 --> 33:58.800
two and only, Penn and Teller.
Don't go away.

33:58.800 --> 34:03.770

34:08.870 --> 34:12.300
[jazz music]
♪ ♪

34:12.300 --> 34:16.730
[cheers and applause] 
- Now, I get the pleasure

34:16.730 --> 34:19.300
of introducing the only
power couple with more magic

34:19.300 --> 34:22.270
than Beyonce and Jay Z.
Yeah, they've got 99 problems,

34:22.270 --> 34:24.130
but a trick ain't one.
It is, of course,

34:24.130 --> 34:28.199
Penn and Teller.
[cheers and applause]

34:35.030 --> 34:37.000
- Since we first met,
Teller and I have been having

34:37.000 --> 34:40.100
a conversation about how
magic works.

34:40.100 --> 34:42.630
Now, obviously,
there's no such thing as magic,

34:42.630 --> 34:44.870
but the only way to make it feel
like there's such a thing

34:44.870 --> 34:47.330
as magic,
is by monkeying with these maps

34:47.330 --> 34:49.800
that we all carry around
inside our heads.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.469
We're gonna do a trick
for one person

34:52.469 --> 34:54.900
in the audience here, and uh...
Yeah, what's your name, please?

34:54.900 --> 34:56.230
- Donna Jean.
- Donna Jean?

34:56.230 --> 34:57.570
- Yes.
- Can you help me, please,

34:57.570 --> 34:58.900
Donna Jean?
Right up here.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.400
I'm gonna show you something,
Donna Jean.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.730
Watch your step here,
Donna Jean.

35:01.730 --> 35:04.070
[cheers and applause] 
Donna Jean, that's Teller.

35:04.070 --> 35:06.530
Teller, that's Donna Jean.
We gonna have you stand

35:06.530 --> 35:11.570
right on that star that we have
for Jonathan there, Donna Jean.

35:11.570 --> 35:13.400
Now, Donna Jean,
now that you're onstage,

35:13.400 --> 35:15.900
and the lights are in your eyes
and everything,

35:15.900 --> 35:17.400
it's a little hard
to see your seat,

35:17.400 --> 35:19.500
but you already built a map
inside your head, haven't you,

35:19.500 --> 35:20.900
Donna Jean?
- Yes, of course.

35:20.900 --> 35:22.430
- You know right where
you're sitting, you know who's

35:22.430 --> 35:24.170
sitting around you, 
you can walk out of the lobby.

35:24.170 --> 35:25.730
All that back.
Here's what we're gonna do.

35:25.730 --> 35:28.070
We're gonna try to have
the magic happen inside

35:28.070 --> 35:30.270
of your head.
Now, during this bit,

35:30.270 --> 35:32.730
we're going to ask you to
go to the map inside your head,

35:32.730 --> 35:34.530
I'll ask you to close your eyes
a few times.

35:34.530 --> 35:36.070
Not right now, not right now.
- Okay. [laughter]

35:36.070 --> 35:37.600
- When we tell you
to close your eyes,

35:37.600 --> 35:39.530
to make sure you keep
your eyes shut, Donna Jean.

35:39.530 --> 35:41.430
we'll put our fingertips
very lightly on your eyelids.

35:41.430 --> 35:42.870
- All right.
- Is that gonna be

35:42.870 --> 35:44.270
too weird for you?
- I live in Vegas,

35:44.270 --> 35:46.330
it's not that creepy.
[laughter]

35:46.330 --> 35:47.670
- When I tell you
to close your eyes,

35:47.670 --> 35:49.530
I suggest you do it right away,
'cause we're coming in.

35:49.530 --> 35:50.870
- All right.
[laughter]

35:50.870 --> 35:52.230
- And if you don't,
it turns into a

35:52.230 --> 35:53.730
Three Stooges routine...
- [laughs]

35:53.730 --> 35:55.170
- And you're standing
right in the great

35:55.170 --> 35:59.330
Curly Howard spot, Donna Jean.
Uh, Donna Jean, examine that

35:59.330 --> 36:01.600
ring, would you please?
Just make sure it's a solid r--

36:01.600 --> 36:03.000
take it, you can take it
from Teller, yeah.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.800
Make sure it's a solid ring
there, Donna Jean.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.130
No gaps in it.
- Pretty solid.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.530
- Now just put that
right around my neck,

36:07.530 --> 36:09.330
so you know right where it is.
Okay, Donna Jean?

36:09.330 --> 36:11.430
Now, as I said,
there'll be no magic during

36:11.430 --> 36:15.730
this bit on stage, whatsoever.
The only magic in this room

36:15.730 --> 36:18.000
will be inside
Donna Jean's head,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
so please, all of you,
try to watch the next few tricks

36:21.000 --> 36:24.670
from right inside her head.
Donna Jean, would you put

36:24.670 --> 36:26.070
your hands just like this
so they touch.

36:26.070 --> 36:27.400
So they touch.
- Is that good?

36:27.400 --> 36:28.830
- Yeah, just like that.
We're gonna start rubbing our

36:28.830 --> 36:30.570
fingers right down--
Yeah, a little bit higher there.

36:30.570 --> 36:32.630
Yeah, right about there, yeah.
Rubbing our fingers right down

36:32.630 --> 36:35.930
your arms there, Donna Jean.
Right down your arms.

36:35.930 --> 36:37.930
[laughter]
Close your eyes, Donna Jean,

36:37.930 --> 36:39.730
close your eyes.
One finger tip on each eyelid,

36:39.730 --> 36:41.730
and one fingertip
on the back of each hand.

36:41.730 --> 36:44.230
Now, Donna Jean, you feel Teller
touching the back

36:44.230 --> 36:46.230
of your right hand,
I'm right over here

36:46.230 --> 36:49.700
on your left, Donna Jean.
Now think about our fingertips

36:49.700 --> 36:52.030
on the back of your hands,
think about our fingers,

36:52.030 --> 36:53.730
where our hands would be,
where our wrists would be,

36:53.730 --> 36:55.800
and just reach out
and hold our wrists, Donna Jean.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.400
Hold Tel--yeah, put your
palms down, palms down, yeah.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.970
- Palms down?
- Yup, but hold our wrists.

36:59.970 --> 37:02.000
- Okay.
- Now just hold nice and tight

37:02.000 --> 37:03.400
with your hands,
but leave your elbows

37:03.400 --> 37:05.770
a little bit loose so we
can move around, Donna Jean.

37:05.770 --> 37:07.430
Here's where we go to
the map inside your head,

37:07.430 --> 37:09.630
the imagination.
This will be really easy

37:09.630 --> 37:12.070
to imagine, Donna Jean.
You'll be able to feel

37:12.070 --> 37:14.070
me leaning over,
you hear me leaning over--

37:14.070 --> 37:15.830
Teller, reach across.
Teller's grabbing that ring

37:15.830 --> 37:19.470
that you put around my neck.
So imagine Teller holding

37:19.470 --> 37:21.730
the bottom of that ring,
that you put around my neck.

37:21.730 --> 37:23.800
That solid ring.
The next thing

37:23.800 --> 37:25.700
I also want you to imagine
is impossible.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.300
I want you to imagine
that Teller rips the ring

37:28.300 --> 37:30.900
through my neck, which is
biologically impossible.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.500
And links it onto your arm, 
which is

37:33.500 --> 37:35.900
topologically impossible,
as long as you keep

37:35.900 --> 37:38.930
holding this wrist.
It's impossible, Donna Jean,

37:38.930 --> 37:41.570
but I want you to imagine it.
Imagine that Teller rips

37:41.570 --> 37:43.870
the ring through my neck,
and links it onto your--

37:43.870 --> 37:46.230
[chokes]
Arm.

37:46.230 --> 37:48.000
Feel that, Donna Jean?
Open your eyes, sweetheart,

37:48.000 --> 37:49.400
open your eyes.
Is that solid there, Donna Jean?

37:49.400 --> 37:51.100
- Yeah.
[cheers and applause]

37:51.100 --> 37:53.070
- Totally unbroken.
- Yup.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.200
- Is gonna get a
little weirder, Donna Jean.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.670
Face the audience there, 
Donna Jean, face the audience.

37:57.670 --> 38:00.130
Don't, now, here we go,
Donna Jean.

38:00.130 --> 38:01.970
Close your eyes, Donna Jean,
close your eyes.

38:01.970 --> 38:03.700
One fingertip on each eyelid,
You're holding one

38:03.700 --> 38:05.770
of each of our hands.
Take your right hand,

38:05.770 --> 38:07.670
Donna Jean, reach across
and grab that ring.

38:07.670 --> 38:10.970
Then slide that ring right off
your arm there, Donna Jean.

38:10.970 --> 38:12.400
There, don't want to let go
of you at all.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.870
Now bring that ring above
your left arm and just tap it

38:15.870 --> 38:17.330
a couple times.
Beautiful.

38:17.330 --> 38:19.870
That's very easy to imagine
that ring, isn't it, Donna Jean?

38:19.870 --> 38:21.270
- Yes.
- Cause you're holding it

38:21.270 --> 38:23.800
and also tapping it.
Now raise that ring a few inches

38:23.800 --> 38:26.100
above your arm there.
And hold it there nice and still

38:26.100 --> 38:28.200
there, Donna Jean.
In just a moment, Donna Jean,

38:28.200 --> 38:32.030
I'm gonna count to three.
Right after I count to three,

38:32.030 --> 38:34.370
in the very next beat,
just let go of the ring.

38:34.370 --> 38:36.930
Let if fall completely,
drop it absolutely.

38:36.930 --> 38:39.370
When you drop it, Donna Jean,
after I count to three,

38:39.370 --> 38:42.470
it's gonna feel a little weird.
You expect that ring to hit

38:42.470 --> 38:45.570
arm, but it won't, Donna Jean.
Instead, imagine this,

38:45.570 --> 38:47.130
Donna Jean.
The bottom of the ring

38:47.130 --> 38:50.000
will open up,
it'll suck this arm in,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.870
and then it will heal up.
When you drop that ring,

38:52.870 --> 38:55.630
Donna Jean, you will link it
onto this arm

38:55.630 --> 38:57.730
without me letting go
of this wrist.

38:57.730 --> 38:59.530
And if you people
can watch this,

38:59.530 --> 39:04.430
from inside Donna Jean's head,
this may be the biggest miracle

39:04.430 --> 39:07.530
you experience tonight.
Right after three, Donna Jean.

39:07.530 --> 39:11.070
And one, two, three, drop.
Feel that, Donna Jean?

39:11.070 --> 39:12.800
- [laughs]
- Open your eyes there,

39:12.800 --> 39:14.200
Donna Jean, open your eyes.
[cheers and applause]

39:14.200 --> 39:16.070
Is that solid there, Donna Jean?
- Yeah.

39:16.070 --> 39:17.900
- Totally unbroken there,
Donna Jean?

39:17.900 --> 39:19.770
One more, Donna Jean, one more.
- All right.

39:19.770 --> 39:21.730
- One more.
[cheers and applause]

39:21.730 --> 39:23.800
We're all set there?
Please face the front.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.800
Yeah, close your eyes there,
Donna Jean, close your eyes.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.630
Now take the ring in both hands
there, Donna Jean.

39:27.630 --> 39:29.500
Take it in both hands, yup.
Get a sense of that, Donna Jean.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.330
It's a solid ring,
isn't it, there?

39:31.330 --> 39:32.900
- Yup.
- Hold the ring in

39:32.900 --> 39:34.570
your right hand.
Let go with your left hand.

39:34.570 --> 39:35.970
Hold with your right hand,
let go.

39:35.970 --> 39:37.600
Use that left hand to cover
your own eyes.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.400
Replace our fingers with yours.
Yeah.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.370
Now, Donna Jean, you've created
a solid ring of flesh,

39:41.370 --> 39:42.800
haven't you?
- Right.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.100
- From your face, to your hand
to your wrist, to your arm,

39:45.100 --> 39:47.970
to your elbow, to your arm,
to your shoulder, to your neck,

39:47.970 --> 39:49.730
to your face.
That's an unbroken ring.

39:49.730 --> 39:52.670
There's no way we could link
anything onto this ring

39:52.670 --> 39:55.800
as long as your hand
is right against your face.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.830
Let me have that ring,
Donna Jean.

39:57.830 --> 40:00.900
Now imagine this.
And one, two, three.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.530
Feel that, Donna Jean?
- [laughs]

40:02.530 --> 40:03.870
- Open your eyes there,
Donna Jean, open your eyes.

40:03.870 --> 40:05.270
[cheers and applause] 
Is that solid there, Donna Jean?

40:05.270 --> 40:06.600
- Yeah.
- Do you have a sense

40:06.600 --> 40:07.930
of where I am?
- Thank you so much.

40:07.930 --> 40:10.100
- Sense of where Teller is?
- Thank you.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.870
- Sense of where your seat is
right there, Donna Jean.

40:11.870 --> 40:15.300
Inside Donna Jean's head,
right there.

40:15.300 --> 40:18.070
Inside Donna Jean's head.
- Penn and Teller,

40:18.070 --> 40:19.430
ladies and gentlemen.
And that is...

40:19.430 --> 40:21.570
- Thanks for the assist, sir.
- Fantastic.

40:21.570 --> 40:23.000
Oh, I'm very thrilled
to be part of the act

40:23.000 --> 40:24.800
for that brief moment.
That's all the magic

40:24.800 --> 40:26.870
we can handle for one night.
But do join us next week.

40:26.870 --> 40:29.130
We'll be waiting for you here,
in Las Vegas with more

40:29.130 --> 40:31.570
<i>Penn & Teller: Fool Us.
</i> Good night everybody.
