WEBVTT

00:00.703 --> 00:03.321
It's our first wedding together
so we need nicknames.

00:03.602 --> 00:06.521
Nick is Knick-Knack!
Or Mr. Suspenders.

00:06.603 --> 00:08.721
No nicknames, ok?
Your only job tonight

00:09.003 --> 00:10.021
is to be Nick's girlfriend, okay?

00:10.030 --> 00:12.621
And make sure he stays
out of trouble with Caroline.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.000
Why can't you and Winston help?

00:14.130 --> 00:16.500
We've tried...
He doesn't listen to us anymore.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.500
She's not coming back, Nick.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
He's right, I don't.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.100
♪ Da, da-da, dah!! ♪

00:22.150 --> 00:23.149
No!

00:23.150 --> 00:26.700
That is the ugliest dress
I've ever seen, Jess!

00:27.050 --> 00:29.200
I'm really gonna need you
to step it up tonight, ok?

00:29.450 --> 00:31.000
When I see you, I wanna be thinking...

00:31.550 --> 00:33.800
"Who let the dirty slut
out of the slut house?"

00:34.450 --> 00:37.000
Probably the slut butler, right?

00:37.750 --> 00:40.400
<i>Yo, let's go.
We can't be late, I am in the weeding.</i>

00:40.450 --> 00:41.900
You're the usher,
so relax!

00:41.950 --> 00:43.400
Yeah! I'll be busy.

00:43.450 --> 00:44.400
That way
I won't have to sit around

00:44.450 --> 00:45.900
answering a bunch of
stupid questions all day.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.400
Like, "Do you have a job."

00:47.500 --> 00:48.900
"Are you still playing basketball."

00:49.303 --> 00:52.221
Does it look like I'm still
playing overseas basketball?

00:52.306 --> 00:53.840
What is the matter with you?

00:53.891 --> 00:55.725
This is the first job I've had
in, like, two months, dude,

00:55.809 --> 00:57.143
and I really want
to just get in there

00:57.210 --> 00:58.311
and ush this wedding in the face!

00:58.378 --> 01:00.646
- You're gonna be great, man.
- So when we do

01:00.714 --> 01:02.815
the chicken dance, I do it
a little bit differently.

01:02.883 --> 01:04.483
I know that it usually
goes, like...

01:04.551 --> 01:05.735
♪ Da-da, da-da, da-da, da... ♪.

01:05.819 --> 01:07.103
Oh. ♪ Da-da, da-da, da-da, da. ♪

01:08.572 --> 01:11.274
But instead of doing claps,
I like to do a peck.

01:11.358 --> 01:13.058
'Cause it's more realistic.

01:13.110 --> 01:14.660
No chicken dance!

01:14.728 --> 01:16.245
Look, we're not
trying to be mean.

01:16.330 --> 01:19.615
We just don't want you
to be yourself... in any way.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.001
Okay. Suppress the Jess.

01:22.068 --> 01:23.920
Got it.

01:24.004 --> 01:25.571
Did you use my hair gel?

01:25.622 --> 01:26.873
Did I use your
hair gel?

01:26.924 --> 01:29.425
I'm not gonna be mad.
Just let me know if you did.

01:29.510 --> 01:30.576
- No.
- You sure?

01:30.627 --> 01:31.711
I used your hair gel.

01:31.762 --> 01:33.312
Are you serious?

01:33.380 --> 01:35.498
Yeah. It's...

01:36.566 --> 01:39.135
Who let the dirty slut
out of the slut house?

01:39.219 --> 01:41.854
Wow. You look great.

01:41.922 --> 01:44.807
Let's go knock biscuits,
brother-cousins.

01:44.892 --> 01:46.225
No!

01:46.276 --> 01:48.311
No teeth, Jess.
You can't use prop teeth.

01:48.395 --> 01:49.529
Come on, guys.

01:49.596 --> 01:50.847
These are hilarious.

01:50.914 --> 01:52.231
Kids love these.

01:53.799 --> 01:56.184
<i>♪ Who's that girl?
♪♪ Who's that girl? ♪</i>

01:56.185 --> 01:57.171

02:04.944 --> 02:06.496
You want to know one
of my beauty secrets?

02:07.080 --> 02:08.631
The only way
I could fit in this dress

02:08.715 --> 02:11.450
was by wearing little girl's
bicycle shorts underneath.

02:11.502 --> 02:12.668

bubbles, no bubbles, please.

02:18.124 --> 02:23.563
Ooh, a lot of big game here tonight. Yo.

02:23.630 --> 02:25.464
- Oh. Oh, there's Brooke.
- Who's Brooke?

02:25.516 --> 02:27.466
He's been into her
since freshman year.

02:27.518 --> 02:28.968
She used to get drunk
and pass out on our porch.

02:29.019 --> 02:30.853
It was like having a hot,
alcoholic cat.

02:30.938 --> 02:32.321
I'd always leave
water out for her.

02:32.406 --> 02:34.357
Okay. Tonight
just got real.

02:34.441 --> 02:36.141
She goes on top
of the kill list.

02:36.193 --> 02:37.493
Is that because
you're gonna attempt

02:37.578 --> 02:39.328
to kill her
by having sex with her?

02:39.413 --> 02:40.746
More or less, yeah.

02:40.814 --> 02:43.449
Oh, Schmidt, one day you're
gonna kill the nicest girl.

02:46.620 --> 02:47.787
Look at my new boyfriend.

02:47.838 --> 02:50.506
So fancy in his big boy tie.

02:50.591 --> 02:52.008
Jess, would you
please stop?

02:52.092 --> 02:53.376
Okay, what is it with Caroline?

02:53.460 --> 02:54.710
You're like a different person.

02:54.795 --> 02:57.346
Just focus on getting
through today, please.

02:57.431 --> 02:59.832
Okay, Mr. Boy T. Friend.

02:59.883 --> 03:00.850
What did I tell you?

03:00.934 --> 03:02.351
Don't be myself.
Yes.

03:02.436 --> 03:04.187
That's what I love
about our relationship.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.555
You never let me be myself.

03:07.891 --> 03:09.442
Hey!

03:09.509 --> 03:10.943
Winston!

03:12.011 --> 03:13.067
- You're back.
- Yeah.

03:13.730 --> 03:14.947
What are you up to?
Where you working at?

03:16.015 --> 03:17.900
Here. As an usher.

03:18.485 --> 03:20.453
Hi. What a beautiful dress.

03:20.537 --> 03:21.871
I'm surprised
you noticed the dress.

03:21.955 --> 03:23.239
I was distracted
by the woman inside.

03:25.492 --> 03:27.293
Jimmy Longjam, alternate usher.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.794
Alternate usher.

03:28.862 --> 03:30.546
I mean, I'm here.
I'm the usher.

03:30.631 --> 03:31.914
You were late.
It's called commitment.

03:31.999 --> 03:33.716
Look it up
in a typewriter, old man.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.635
- What?!
- How much money do you make?

03:35.702 --> 03:36.802
Where is your mother?

03:36.870 --> 03:37.970
Can someone help me?

03:38.038 --> 03:39.872
Hello. Bride or groom?

03:47.231 --> 03:49.181
Oh, no. No, not tonight.

03:49.233 --> 03:51.934
No!

03:52.019 --> 03:52.885
Who is that?

03:52.936 --> 03:54.053
Gretchen Nelson.

03:54.104 --> 03:55.271
She's a terrible person.

03:55.355 --> 03:56.405
We can't stand each other.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.107
At every wedding, we end up...

03:58.191 --> 03:59.175
we end up having sex.

04:09.886 --> 04:11.037

the sex is amazing.

04:12.088 --> 04:13.405
Oh, she's coming over.

04:13.457 --> 04:14.740
Hey, there are those
people that we know.

04:14.791 --> 04:15.875
Oh, what people?

04:18.243 --> 04:20.846
- Hello, Gretchen.
- Uh-huh.

04:20.914 --> 04:22.130
I see you wore
the pantsuit again.

04:22.215 --> 04:23.516
This is a new one.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.769
It's got way more
stretch... in the pants.

04:26.853 --> 04:28.638
- That's horrible.
- Are you ready for tonight?

04:29.322 --> 04:30.689
I'm gonna tie you down

04:30.756 --> 04:32.441
and show you pictures
of my river rafting trip.

04:32.526 --> 04:34.426
Oh, my God,
how many are there?

04:34.478 --> 04:36.395
- It's a two-hour slideshow.
- No, Gretchen.

04:36.446 --> 04:38.064
We can't do this anymore, okay?

04:38.115 --> 04:39.448
It's not... It's not healthy.

04:39.533 --> 04:40.566
- All right? Please, no more.
- Yeah.

04:43.519 --> 04:44.620
There she is.
There she is.

04:44.704 --> 04:46.072
She's right over there.
There she is.

04:46.123 --> 04:48.107
She's right over here.
She's right...

04:48.658 --> 04:50.659
Just be cool...
Okay, okay.

04:50.743 --> 04:51.410
Hi.

04:51.461 --> 04:52.662
Hey, Caroline. Wow.

04:53.246 --> 04:54.463
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

04:54.548 --> 04:55.781
Great to see you.

04:55.832 --> 04:57.383
Nicholas, you have
to introduce me.

04:57.850 --> 04:58.834
Uh, yeah, of course.

04:58.919 --> 05:01.053
Uh, Jess, this is Caroline.

05:01.121 --> 05:02.121
Hi.

05:02.172 --> 05:03.806
One more time.
Cara-lee?

05:03.890 --> 05:05.641
- Uh, Caroline.- Caraloo?

05:05.726 --> 05:07.059
- Coraline?- Caroline.

05:07.127 --> 05:10.646
Okay. Fancy.

05:10.731 --> 05:12.732
Well, I'm Nicholas's girlfriend.

05:12.799 --> 05:14.100
We just started dating,

05:14.151 --> 05:17.153
so we're still
in that honeymoon phase.

05:17.237 --> 05:19.322
I barely sleep.
So much doing it.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.690
So much doing it.

05:20.774 --> 05:21.907
It's crazy.

05:21.975 --> 05:23.359
He's so soft,
like a towel.

05:23.443 --> 05:25.477
Well, it was
nice to meet you.

05:25.529 --> 05:27.413
So nice to meet you,
too, Carol.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.614
Caroline.

05:28.665 --> 05:30.282
I give up! I guess

05:30.334 --> 05:31.751
I'll see you later.

05:31.818 --> 05:33.035
For sure, for sure, for sure.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.041
Oh, my God.
Was she jealous?

05:39.126 --> 05:41.660
I think she was jealous.
You did so good.

05:41.712 --> 05:42.995
That was remarkable.

05:43.046 --> 05:45.998
I just done what
my mama learnt me.

05:46.049 --> 05:47.967
Give me the teeth.

06:01.011 --> 06:01.829
Brooke.

06:01.881 --> 06:03.715
Hi. Wow.

06:04.099 --> 06:05.049
Schmidt.

06:05.634 --> 06:07.936
You used to borrow my
poncho freshman year.

06:08.003 --> 06:09.137
Remember that? No.

06:09.188 --> 06:10.555
Hmm.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.005
Fat Schmidt?

06:14.026 --> 06:15.310
Fat Schmidt!

06:15.361 --> 06:17.145
Of course! Wow.

06:17.196 --> 06:19.113
You look great.

06:19.181 --> 06:20.949
You, also, for sure.

06:21.016 --> 06:22.617
Um, how are your classes?

06:22.684 --> 06:25.019
I mean, not that we're... not
that we're in school anymore.

06:25.070 --> 06:26.120
I know that.

06:26.188 --> 06:28.323
What are you drinking?
White wine?

06:28.374 --> 06:29.657
I'm not drinking.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.159
I'm sober, six months.

06:31.210 --> 06:32.994
Can I get a seltzer, please?

06:33.045 --> 06:34.495
Me, too.

06:34.547 --> 06:36.214
You're six months sober, also?

06:36.298 --> 06:37.215
Seven months. One more.

06:37.299 --> 06:38.967
Wow. That's great.

06:39.034 --> 06:40.802
Congratulations.

06:40.869 --> 06:42.003
Here's your, uh, white wine.

06:42.054 --> 06:43.671
What? What?
That's a mistake.

06:43.722 --> 06:44.923
No, I didn't
order that. No!

06:45.007 --> 06:46.341
No, sir!

06:46.392 --> 06:48.059
Even the...
even smell of it.

06:48.143 --> 06:49.877
I'm gonna run back to my table.

06:49.929 --> 06:52.981
But you can come talk
to me if you need to.

06:53.048 --> 06:54.766
Oh. Okay, thank you.

06:56.735 --> 06:58.319
So what I need you
to do is this.

06:58.387 --> 07:01.055
I need you to put vodka
in a water bottle, okay?

07:01.106 --> 07:03.557
Then rendezvous with me
in the restroom, okay?

07:05.060 --> 07:07.561
Same page? Same page?

07:10.749 --> 07:12.900
This kid is pushing my buttons.

07:12.952 --> 07:15.620
Winston, he's just
a little boy. Relax.

07:15.704 --> 07:17.922
Brooke asks, I'm six
months clean and sober,

07:18.007 --> 07:19.374
and looking to
settle down.

07:19.425 --> 07:21.459
Great. Schmidt's sober.

07:21.543 --> 07:22.627
What are you doing?

07:22.711 --> 07:24.745
She's looking at us.

07:27.749 --> 07:29.917
Your head is shaped
like a yam.

07:29.969 --> 07:32.053
Yeah, I know. I can't
wear soft hats.

07:32.104 --> 07:33.855
Uh-huh.
Hey, when she comes here,

07:33.922 --> 07:34.606
I want to talk
to her by myself.

07:34.690 --> 07:37.025
- No. Are you sure?
- Jess, I'm fine, for real.

07:37.092 --> 07:38.426
Oh, hey.

07:38.477 --> 07:40.028
Could that ceremony
have lasted any longer?

07:40.095 --> 07:41.896
- It really was...
- Ha, ha. We loved it.

07:41.947 --> 07:44.765
Taking notes in case Mr. Commitment-Phobe over here

07:44.817 --> 07:46.484
decides to make an honest woman
out of me.

07:46.568 --> 07:47.435
Oh.

07:47.486 --> 07:48.870
Hey, Jess,

07:48.937 --> 07:50.905
did you want
to go do that thing from...?

07:50.956 --> 07:52.907
Yes, I did.
I want to do it very badly.

07:52.958 --> 07:54.108
- Yup.
- Thank you.

07:54.159 --> 07:57.161
And now,
for the first time ever,

07:57.246 --> 08:00.498
Mr. and Mrs. Handelman-Pyong.

08:00.582 --> 08:01.799
♪ ♪

08:06.338 --> 08:09.623
Yay! Bride and groom!

08:09.675 --> 08:11.559
Make way!

08:11.626 --> 08:15.179

08:21.520 --> 08:23.571
Jess is... great.

08:23.638 --> 08:26.140
The best. Yeah, so happy.

08:26.191 --> 08:28.276
Are you guys
pretty serious, or...?

08:28.327 --> 08:30.244
Yeah, we are pretty serious.

08:30.312 --> 08:32.313
Yeah, we live together.

08:32.364 --> 08:34.082
I mean, different bedrooms,
but shared bathroom,

08:34.149 --> 08:35.832
so that's something.

08:36.618 --> 08:38.419
Alcohol. Any kind
