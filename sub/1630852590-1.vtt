00:01.369 --> 00:03.035
Griffin:
<i> My dad bought an old hotel.</i>

00:03.187 --> 00:05.520
<i> Now I'm stuck here</i>
<i> while my parents fix up</i>
<i> the tremont.</i>

00:05.623 --> 00:07.406
(loudly):
You live at the tremont?

00:08.192 --> 00:09.541
Zoey:
<i> Who's savannah?</i>

00:09.660 --> 00:11.210
The ghost of a kid

00:11.328 --> 00:13.212
who's supposedly been
haunting the hotel

00:13.330 --> 00:14.830
<i> for 30 years.</i>

00:15.532 --> 00:17.049
I said supposedly.

00:19.703 --> 00:21.369
We saw a ghost
in the tremont
last night.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.722
-(ghost screams)
-(topher screams)

00:23.841 --> 00:25.340
I saw a ghost.

00:26.143 --> 00:27.226
Tremont has a bunker?

00:27.344 --> 00:28.594
Griffin:
<i> Let's check it out.</i>

00:29.230 --> 00:31.146
Griffin, look.

00:32.016 --> 00:33.899
Griffin:<i> It's like</i>
<i> we stepped back in time.</i>

00:34.051 --> 00:35.234
Harper:
<i> She's alive, griffin.</i>

00:35.352 --> 00:37.152
Time travel
is the only explanation.

00:38.522 --> 00:39.488
Savannah?

00:41.442 --> 00:42.891
Harper:
<i> The tremont</i>
<i> is completely safe.</i>

00:42.943 --> 00:44.109
Jess:
<i> The tremont is cursed!</i>

00:46.914 --> 00:48.080
Griffin:
<i> Maybe we're messing</i>
<i> with things</i>

00:48.199 --> 00:49.865
<i> that shouldn't be</i>
<i> messed with.</i>

00:50.734 --> 00:51.834
(gasps)

00:53.454 --> 00:55.587
harper:<i> Savannah!</i>
<i> You said you were never</i>
<i> coming through the portal.</i>

00:55.706 --> 00:57.239
I know.
Then I found this.

00:57.341 --> 00:59.258
Looks like you're not done
time traveling either.

00:59.376 --> 01:01.593
Griffin:<i> Finally,</i>
<i> an adventure that</i>
<i> doesn't involve saving you.</i>

01:01.745 --> 01:03.045
So a ghost
that's not me.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.412
It could be anyone.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.131
Griffin:
<i> There's only one way</i>
<i> to find out.</i>

01:07.101 --> 01:08.267
Harper:
<i> Let's go.</i>

01:08.385 --> 01:09.885
Griffin:
<i> As long as we're home</i>
<i> before dinner.</i>

01:11.806 --> 01:15.023
(intense music playing)

01:21.315 --> 01:24.917
(woman humming "amazing grace")

01:41.135 --> 01:44.136
(humming continues)

02:06.643 --> 02:09.611
(humming continues)

02:14.535 --> 02:16.585
(rocking chair creaking)

02:39.143 --> 02:40.508
(humming stops)

02:40.561 --> 02:41.810
(creaking stops)

02:49.870 --> 02:50.953
(gasps)

02:51.038 --> 02:53.288
ben! You scared me.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.958
Sorry. Uh, I was
looking for griffin.
He in there?

02:57.545 --> 02:58.827
No one is.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.034
Man:
Daisy, is that you?

03:06.086 --> 03:07.369
-He's coming.
-Go!

03:07.421 --> 03:08.503
Who--

03:09.673 --> 03:10.589
woah.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.345
What was that about?

03:17.147 --> 03:18.814
It was all so strange...

03:19.433 --> 03:20.715
Like looking in a mirror.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.850
How do you mean?

03:22.686 --> 03:23.685
Didn't you see that girl?

03:24.688 --> 03:27.573
We're nearly identical.
She could've been me.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.908
How's that possible?

03:33.864 --> 03:35.113
Sam, come back!

03:35.833 --> 03:37.082
Where is he off to now?

03:37.201 --> 03:39.034
Sam went tearing through
the field after some--

03:39.119 --> 03:41.069
probably realized
his chores
are still waiting.

03:41.171 --> 03:42.754
Pay him no mind.

03:44.041 --> 03:46.341
That boy's head
is always somewhere else.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.014
Let me give you a hand.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.524
(tense music playing)

04:45.185 --> 04:48.153
(theme music playing)

05:10.711 --> 05:12.010
that man was
in the same chair

05:12.129 --> 05:13.795
I saw rocking
by itself earlier.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.213
That can't be
a coincidence.

05:15.332 --> 05:16.998
Do you think we saw
a ghost back there?

05:17.051 --> 05:19.667
I'm saying
he must be the ghost
haunting the hotel now,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.520
the one who led us
into the past.

05:21.638 --> 05:22.688
But why?

05:22.806 --> 05:24.389
And what about the girl
on the porch?

05:24.508 --> 05:26.308
She has to be
one of my relatives.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.115
My family used to own
the tremont,

05:33.200 --> 05:34.449
back before it was
a hotel.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.184
That explains
the resemblance.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.569
But the man
in the rocking chair

05:37.687 --> 05:39.287
was calling out
for somebody
named daisy.

05:39.373 --> 05:42.190
-So that would make her your...
-Harper: I'm not sure.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.626
After my dad died,
my mom didn't talk
about it much.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.295
All I really know
is that they met
on her last day of camp.

05:47.998 --> 05:49.864
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.866
I have to get home.
The camp is opening today

05:51.919 --> 05:53.885
and I'm supposed
to be helping everyone
get settled

05:54.037 --> 05:55.370
into the bunkhouses.

05:55.472 --> 05:57.389
Kind of wild you're gonna be
a camper there again.

05:57.508 --> 05:59.007
Junior counselor, actually.

05:59.093 --> 06:01.059
This time I'll be the one
creeping kids out

06:01.178 --> 06:02.677
with the legend of moss man.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.712
And busting them
for pulling pranks.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.098
I wouldn't go that far.

06:06.216 --> 06:07.983
I mean, I am still me.

06:09.019 --> 06:10.268
(lights crackling)

06:12.055 --> 06:14.022
well, guess this
is goodbye again.

06:16.893 --> 06:17.943
Doesn't have to be.

06:18.695 --> 06:20.412
There could be a clue
in 1962

06:20.514 --> 06:21.847
about the man
in the rocking chair,

06:21.949 --> 06:23.782
who he is and why he's
haunting the hotel.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.685
If you come up with something,
send us a message.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.554
Tree house again?
Like we did
with the coffee can?

06:29.623 --> 06:31.089
We shouldn't chance it.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.074
There's too many people
that know about that place.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.176
What about the basement?

06:34.762 --> 06:36.261
Under a floorboard or something?

06:37.464 --> 06:38.797
Bottom of the stairs?

06:39.433 --> 06:40.432
That works.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.967
Sure you won't get in trouble
for snooping?

06:42.102 --> 06:43.769
We don't wanna mess things up
for you back home.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.104
Can't get in trouble
if you don't get caught.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.925
I should get back too.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.978
The twins probably think
a ghost grabbed me.

06:53.096 --> 06:54.729
A ghost who wants
to melt off our faces?

06:56.900 --> 06:59.267
-I was kidding about that.
-Uh-huh. Sure you were.

06:59.369 --> 07:02.454
(radio whirring)

07:11.799 --> 07:13.915
maybe it only
feels comfortable
rocking in front of kids.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.251
It's a chair, wyatt.
It doesn't have feelings.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.619
He means the ghost.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.504
And this one
definitely has feelings.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.139
Big feelings.

07:21.291 --> 07:22.474
Frustration mostly

07:22.593 --> 07:25.093
because we can't figure out
what it's trying to tell us.

07:25.179 --> 07:26.761
Tell me again
what you think you saw.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.814
The chair started
to move...

07:28.965 --> 07:31.183
Back and forth.
Real slow.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.400
Wait. I thought
you two are done

07:32.486 --> 07:34.519
with all this
supernatural stuff.

07:34.638 --> 07:36.521
So did we!
But the ghost keeps
reaching out

07:36.657 --> 07:37.656
to draw us back in.

07:37.774 --> 07:39.658
It would be rude
not to listen.

07:39.776 --> 07:41.076
Here's an idea.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.746
Why don't you try
listening to your parents
for a change?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.782
We mean it when we say
this place isn't haunted
by savannah.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.451
We know.
The mirror told us.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.286
The mirror?

07:51.371 --> 07:53.038
Wyatt: That's how
the ghost communicates.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.506
Leaves messages
on the glass.

07:54.658 --> 07:57.492
It wrote, "no,"
when we asked
if it was savannah.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.212
It was probably just griffin
messing with you guys.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.130
What about me?

08:02.216 --> 08:04.466
Have you been pranking
wyatt and zoey again?

08:04.551 --> 08:06.384
The mirror fogged up
and the message appeared.

08:06.503 --> 08:08.169
No way griffin could
pull that off.

08:08.272 --> 08:09.554
Just get rid of it, ben.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.556
-You can't!
-We'll never know
what the ghost wants.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.642
I think we'll all sleep better
with the mirror gone.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.393
Besides,
all of this ghost hunting

08:15.512 --> 08:17.028
has become
a huge distraction.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.563
Your mom is right.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.148
It's going to take
everyone pitching in

08:20.234 --> 08:22.033
to get the hotel
finally reopened.

08:22.152 --> 08:24.236
You two can start
by giving me a hand
downstairs.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.321
-But I--
-sarah: That wasn't a request.

08:31.861 --> 08:33.161
Maybe we shouldn't toss it.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.047
Don't tell me you believe
all that ghost talk.

08:37.534 --> 08:39.167
This old mirror might be
worth something.

08:40.170 --> 08:41.419
Could put the money
toward the renovation.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.088
Yeah,
every little bit helps.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.925
But we can't leave it up here.
Too tempting for the twins.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.376
Take it to the basement?

08:49.146 --> 08:50.979
They're way too scared
to go down there.

08:56.386 --> 08:58.770
Argh.
The screws are stripped.

08:59.606 --> 09:02.941
We're gonna need
some serious tools.
Pliers, a drill.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.776
I ever tell you
about the time

09:04.912 --> 09:06.411
grandpa tried
to teach me
how to use one?

09:06.530 --> 09:07.746
Nope.

09:07.864 --> 09:09.331
Went about as well
as you'd expect.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.123
(ominous music)

09:27.768 --> 09:29.467
jess:
Is your brother
still on the couch?

09:30.554 --> 09:32.754
Said something
about slime creatures

09:32.806 --> 09:34.756
and an epic battle
for humanity.

09:34.858 --> 09:36.608
Well, humanity
will have to wait.

09:36.727 --> 09:38.426
It's his turn
to help fold.

09:38.528 --> 09:41.062
-I'll do it.
-Help yourself.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.950
So, was dad into
all that stuff too?

09:45.452 --> 09:47.285
You know,
monsters and ghosts.

09:47.404 --> 09:48.954
Your dad? Please.

09:49.105 --> 09:51.272
Couldn't pay him
to sit through a scary movie,

09:51.325 --> 09:53.775
at least not without
squeezing the life
out of my hand.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.410
Not sure where
topher got it from.

09:56.580 --> 09:57.829
Am I anything like dad?

09:59.383 --> 10:01.616
I'd say you're a good mix
of the both of us.

10:01.718 --> 10:03.969
He had that same
quiet confidence,

10:04.120 --> 10:07.472
but your stubborn streak?
Whew, that's all me.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.009
I was named
after his mom, right?

10:11.144 --> 10:12.761
Yup. Your grandma marie.

10:14.264 --> 10:15.680
Wish you could've met her.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.315
She had a big heart
just like your dad.

10:17.467 --> 10:19.601
And her parents?
What were they like?

10:20.970 --> 10:22.020
Why all the questions?

10:23.690 --> 10:25.657
There's just a lot
I don't know
about our family.

10:26.309 --> 10:27.275
Guess I never will.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.196
You know, the thing
about grandma marie,

10:31.314 --> 10:32.747
she saved everything.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.982
Yeah, it took your dad
close to the three months

10:35.035 --> 10:36.451
to clean out her house
after she passed.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.956
This belonged to her.

10:43.093 --> 10:45.460
-No telling what's inside.
-You've never opened it?

10:46.329 --> 10:48.129
I think your dad
was saving it for you kids.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.882
Guess now's
as good a time as any.

10:52.302 --> 10:53.301
(phone chimes)

10:55.856 --> 10:57.355
ugh, sorry, baby,

10:57.474 --> 10:59.691
kirstin's not feeling well
and she needs me to close.

10:59.810 --> 11:01.026
It's okay. You should go.

11:01.144 --> 11:03.228
You know, I'm gonna take
your brother with me.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.180
He can mop up the cafe
since he couldn't be
bothered to help fold.

11:06.283 --> 11:07.816
-Need anything?
-I'll be fine.

11:08.485 --> 11:09.534
You always are.

11:10.454 --> 11:12.537
-Strongest girl I know.
-Learned from the best.

11:15.826 --> 11:16.958
Okay.

11:39.816 --> 11:41.399
Bunkhouses are
straight down this path

11:41.518 --> 11:43.268
and the springs
are back there.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.719
Can we swim any time?

11:44.771 --> 11:47.221
No campers out here at night
without a counselor.

11:47.324 --> 11:49.441
Well, I'm not afraid
of the dark.

11:49.559 --> 11:51.159
Well, it's easy
to get turned around

11:51.244 --> 11:52.494
when you don't know
these woods...

11:53.246 --> 11:55.280
Or what's in them.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.116
In them?

11:59.202 --> 12:01.953
Legend has it,
something lives out here.

12:03.239 --> 12:04.372
Waiting...

12:05.125 --> 12:07.258
-Watching.
-(leaves rustling)

12:08.795 --> 12:09.794
what was that?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.264
Probably just the wind.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.800
Stay here,
I'll go check it out.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.639
(campers chattering)

12:49.469 --> 12:51.503
(suspenseful music playing)

13:05.268 --> 13:06.468
up a little.

13:07.137 --> 13:08.570
Down.

13:08.672 --> 13:09.938
Lower.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.189
That's too low.

13:12.476 --> 13:14.309
You want it perfect,
right?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.110
I'd settle for done.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.597
Yup, uh,
that's gonna be
a problem

13:19.649 --> 13:22.099
'cause these are
the last two rolls.

13:22.152 --> 13:23.267
You checked the closet?

13:23.370 --> 13:25.320
Yep. And we are
all out of paste.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.489
-Shocking.
-I'll run to the store.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.774
Oh, let me.
Could use a break.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.125
When do we get a break?

13:31.277 --> 13:32.961
You haven't exactly
been helping.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.278
Uh, yes, I have!

13:34.381 --> 13:35.497
All you've done
is stand there.

13:35.632 --> 13:36.998
It's called supervising.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.500
That's one word for it.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.468
Have fun!

13:40.587 --> 13:42.470
Well, I think
we've all earned a break.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.956
-Ice cream at dunn's?
-Dibs on the front!

13:45.008 --> 13:46.290
Zoey:
You had it last time!

13:46.393 --> 13:48.142
-Wyatt: Called it first!
-You comin', bud?

13:48.294 --> 13:51.012
Um, I have a lot of homework
to finish.

13:51.147 --> 13:52.463
Bring me back a shake?

13:52.983 --> 13:54.649
Chocolate with
extra whipped cream?

13:54.768 --> 13:56.234
It's a good guess.

13:56.319 --> 13:57.769
That's what you order
every time.

13:57.854 --> 13:59.604
Not exactly
a man of mystery, griff.

14:05.144 --> 14:08.162
(suspenseful music playing)

14:31.221 --> 14:32.420
hello?

14:34.724 --> 14:35.723
Can you hear me?

14:46.903 --> 14:48.903
(phone ringing)

14:54.828 --> 14:55.960
<i>daisy's my great-grandmother.</i>

14:56.046 --> 14:57.078
And the man
in the rocking chair,

14:57.213 --> 14:58.963
that was her father,
elijah tremont.

14:59.049 --> 15:01.215
<i> So that's where</i>
<i> the hotel got its name.</i>

15:02.552 --> 15:04.002
<i> Did your mom tell you</i>
<i> all this?</i>

15:04.054 --> 15:05.253
I found pictures...

15:06.339 --> 15:08.673
<i>In an old trunk</i>
<i>my dad kept in the garage.</i>

15:08.725 --> 15:10.258
You'll never believe
what else is inside.

15:11.011 --> 15:11.809
<i> Look.</i>

15:12.812 --> 15:14.211
A... Bracelet?

15:14.264 --> 15:15.546
My bracelet!

15:16.399 --> 15:18.549
<i>I was wearing it</i>
<i>when we went to 1930</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

15:18.652 --> 15:20.602
<i>It must've fallen off.</i>

15:20.704 --> 15:23.237
<i>Someone in my family found it</i>
<i>and kept it all this time.</i>

15:23.373 --> 15:24.405
Harper...

15:24.507 --> 15:25.556
<i>It's incredible to think</i>

15:25.659 --> 15:27.108
something of mine
was passed down

15:27.226 --> 15:29.393
for generations
before I was even born.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.579
<i> Harper, how soon</i>
<i> can you get here?</i>

15:31.698 --> 15:32.614
Why?

15:33.333 --> 15:34.282
Look.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.593
Hey, jess.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.880
Hey! I was wondering
if I'd get a chance
to see you guys

15:48.932 --> 15:50.765
before the big move
back to chicago.

15:50.884 --> 15:51.766
Change of plans.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.434
We're staying
in sulphur springs!

15:53.553 --> 15:55.470
-You are?
-We can't leave yet.

15:55.605 --> 15:57.388
Things are
just getting good.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.942
Well, I know two kids
who will be very excited
to hear that.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.610
Topher's out back
bussing tables

16:02.729 --> 16:03.945
if you wanna
tell him the news.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.263
Wyatt:
Wait till we tell him
about the mirror.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.767
Figured you'd finally
had enough of living
in a haunted hotel.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.769
Ah, the only thing scary
about the tremont

16:11.821 --> 16:13.237
is how much work
it needs.

16:13.289 --> 16:15.573
Once we fix one problem,
we find another.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.992
Well, some might say
there's a reason for that.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.277
Now you sound like
the twins.

16:20.330 --> 16:21.996
People have been
telling stories

16:22.132 --> 16:24.666
about seeing ghosts
around that place
for generations.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.617
That's all they are.
Stories.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.503
Urban legends
like moss man.

16:28.621 --> 16:29.804
What if they're not?

16:33.226 --> 16:37.261
I heard humming
coming from griffin's room
earlier.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.564
At least, I think I did.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.350
Probably just left
some music playing.

16:42.485 --> 16:44.569
No, it wasn't the radio.

16:45.739 --> 16:48.656
It sounded like
"amazing grace."

16:49.275 --> 16:50.274
a woman.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.410
When I got to the door...

16:54.364 --> 16:55.530
She stopped.

16:57.167 --> 17:00.501
Nope. Uh-uh. I would be looking
for a new place pronto.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.754
We can't afford
somethin' else.

17:02.839 --> 17:04.789
Opening the hotel
is our only option.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.056
-You ready?
-Huh?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.726
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.229
Where'd you get
this stuff from, anyway?

17:28.364 --> 17:29.864
In that trunk
with the photos.

17:29.983 --> 17:32.200
My grandmother really did
save everything.

17:32.869 --> 17:34.402
This was
her wedding dress.

17:36.239 --> 17:37.905
Relax,
no one's getting married.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.857
The goal
is to blend in, right?

17:39.909 --> 17:42.160
This was
the best I could do
on short notice.

17:42.212 --> 17:44.746
Right.
So what's the plan?

17:45.582 --> 17:48.032
Well, elijah's ghost wants us
to go back to my family's farm.

17:48.084 --> 17:49.667
We need to find out why.

17:51.221 --> 17:52.720
All right. All set.

17:54.724 --> 17:55.807
Here you go.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.311
(radio whirring)

18:03.767 --> 18:05.233
(woman humming)

18:05.351 --> 18:06.400
do you hear that?

18:10.723 --> 18:12.273
It's coming from
over there.

18:13.392 --> 18:16.360
(woman humming "amazing grace")

18:22.485 --> 18:24.418
maybe she's the reason
we had to come back.

18:29.959 --> 18:31.759
Or whatever
she's looking for.

18:32.595 --> 18:34.679
(continues humming)

18:45.441 --> 18:46.808
flashlights have been
passed out,

18:46.910 --> 18:48.709
clues for the scavenger hunt
have been hidden,

18:48.812 --> 18:51.295
and the birdhouses
are ready to be assembled.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.898
I wish all the councilors
were as responsible as you.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.600
Kids?

18:56.820 --> 18:58.769
Take it outside
before something gets--

19:02.108 --> 19:03.307
broken.

19:03.409 --> 19:04.909
Sorry.
We-- we'll clean it up.

19:06.029 --> 19:07.811
It's almost time
for lights out.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.281
Head back to the bunkhouses.
I'll take care of this.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.251
I need to sweep up this glass
before someone gets hurt.

19:13.786 --> 19:14.869
I'll get the broom.

19:15.004 --> 19:16.737
Thanks, honey.
There's one in the basement.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.030
(door opens)

20:15.732 --> 20:17.815
(footsteps receding)

20:20.436 --> 20:21.269
(door closes)

20:28.778 --> 20:32.363
♪ ♪

20:38.070 --> 20:39.203
moss man!

20:45.244 --> 20:46.928
Griff, we're back.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.598
Ugh, look at that!
All that work.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.634
Urban legend, huh?

20:53.753 --> 20:54.802
Oh, man!

20:54.938 --> 20:56.938
It's starting.
Just like topher said.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.440
-The ghost?
-Has to be.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.776
You used like
a gallon of paste
on that paper.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.527
There's
no other explanation.

21:04.781 --> 21:07.281
Mom and dad are
really gonna regret
moving that mirror.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.967
Daisy: They were
in the house, papa.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.804
It's not the first time
we've found people
wandering around.

21:46.856 --> 21:48.489
This wasn't like before.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.308
These...
These people were different.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.328
Only one reason
somebody be looking around here.

21:56.366 --> 21:57.498
The springs.

21:58.334 --> 22:00.167
Elijah:
Probably had the same notion
your mother did.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.586
But we know
there's nothing special
about that water.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.380
I'm gonna turn in.

22:13.383 --> 22:15.833
Sam, make sure to help
your sister with the dishes.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.101
Sam: Yes, sir.

22:26.062 --> 22:27.194
You're right.

22:29.032 --> 22:30.781
Those people aren't
like the others.

22:32.468 --> 22:33.484
And I know why.

22:35.405 --> 22:36.687
They're from outer space.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.073
-Finish your supper, sam.
-I've got proof.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.528
-Found this in the field.
-My bracelet.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.914
See? A star.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.085
People don't just disappear
into thin air, daisy.

22:51.921 --> 22:53.421
Except somehow they did.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.675
(floorboard creaking)

23:01.931 --> 23:02.980
harper, wait.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.433
There she is.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.441
(tense music playing)

23:16.395 --> 23:19.280
(wailing)

23:22.118 --> 23:23.200
come on.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.371
You saw, right?

23:27.423 --> 23:29.123
The woman in the springs,
she just--

23:29.241 --> 23:30.574
vanished.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.460
And if she's a ghost...

23:32.578 --> 23:33.577
We had it all wrong.

23:33.679 --> 23:35.763
It was never elijah
leading us back here.

23:36.766 --> 23:37.798
It was her.

23:39.268 --> 23:42.085
Who is she
and why did she
scream like that?

23:42.138 --> 23:43.270
I don't know.

23:46.392 --> 23:47.892
Griffin, wait! Look.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.067
There's our answer.

23:57.987 --> 23:59.069
Grace.

23:59.956 --> 24:03.040
Daisy's mother,
my great-great grandmother.

24:04.460 --> 24:06.327
The ghost
of the tremont.

24:14.303 --> 24:16.453
Griffin:
<i> Next time on "secrets</i>
<i> of sulphur springs"...</i>

24:16.556 --> 24:17.638
Wyatt:
<i> This is not normal.</i>

24:17.757 --> 24:19.590
-How else do we explain it?
-Zoey: Ghosts.

24:19.675 --> 24:22.176
It feels like
there is something
in this place

24:22.294 --> 24:23.677
<i> and it wants us out.</i>

24:23.796 --> 24:25.513
Savannah:
<i> Something was following me,</i>
<i> back in the woods,</i>

24:25.631 --> 24:27.314
<i> a creature</i>
<i> all covered in moss.</i>

24:27.466 --> 24:29.650
And remember the plan,
as soon as daisy's not around,

24:29.769 --> 24:31.519
I step in,
pretend I'm her.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.154
-Daisy!
-What is all this?

24:33.272 --> 24:34.805
Trying to build
a time machine?

24:34.857 --> 24:36.473
Do you believe
in time travel, harry?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.491
She found it!

24:37.610 --> 24:38.993
<i> Daisy found the portal.</i>

24:39.111 --> 24:43.780
-Harper: Daisy!
-Harper?
