02:19.013 --> 02:20.055
Okay, guys. Ready?

02:21.390 --> 02:22.433
Let's go.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.746
Looking for something?

02:44.121 --> 02:47.541
- What's it to you?
- Don't make me turn you in, Kirk.

02:47.750 --> 02:52.629
Well, don't make me use this. I'll do it.
I swear I'll do it.

02:52.713 --> 02:57.342
You want to cut me? Go ahead.
But you know that won't solve anything.

02:57.426 --> 03:01.180
Oh, God, you have so much to live for.
Don't throw it all away.

03:01.263 --> 03:03.223
Not now. Not like this.

03:03.599 --> 03:05.142
Cut! Print.

03:05.976 --> 03:07.227
Beauty.

03:07.811 --> 03:09.271
Is that what you had in mind, Jake?

03:09.354 --> 03:11.899
Lydia, that was a killer.
That was pure gooseflesh time.

03:11.982 --> 03:13.025
Oh, yes.

03:14.234 --> 03:15.527
Jake, we're in trouble.

03:15.611 --> 03:18.780
The kid you cast as the surfer dude,
he's in the hospital with food poisoning.

03:18.864 --> 03:21.908
Great. My doctor wonders
why I have high blood pressure.

03:21.992 --> 03:24.619
- We could reschedule.
- This is not Shakespeare here.

03:24.703 --> 03:26.413
This is some crummy little scene
we're doing.

03:26.496 --> 03:29.708
- Any jerk off the street can do this.
- Like who?

03:36.131 --> 03:37.632
Hey, how about that kid?

03:42.179 --> 03:43.805
Excuse me.

03:44.097 --> 03:47.142
- Are you SAG by any chance?
- What?

03:47.225 --> 03:49.060
Are you a member
of the Screen Actors Guild?

03:49.477 --> 03:52.147
- No, I'm not an actor. Sorry.
- Do you want to be?

03:52.397 --> 03:54.065
I haven't really thought about it. Why?

03:54.149 --> 03:56.568
<i>Well, we're down here shooting
an episode of Keep It Together.</i>

03:56.651 --> 03:59.070
The TV show?
Oh, my sister's addicted to it.

03:59.154 --> 04:02.115
Yeah. We're in kind of a jam.
One of our day players didn't show,

04:02.198 --> 04:05.076
and if you could spare an hour or two,
it'd be worth your while.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.703
What do I have to do?

04:07.579 --> 04:09.456
You go up to the girls and say,

04:09.539 --> 04:13.209
"Hey, babe, looking good.
Real good, babe."

04:13.918 --> 04:15.295
I get paid for this?

04:17.422 --> 04:19.673
Hey, where's that...

04:21.426 --> 04:23.386
All right, I got the line.

04:27.098 --> 04:28.182
All right.

04:33.563 --> 04:36.357
- Is this make-up?
- So they tell me.

04:36.899 --> 04:41.404
Well, I need more of a tan
or less of a tan. I don't know.

04:41.654 --> 04:43.072
Are you working today?

04:43.322 --> 04:45.533
Yeah, if you can call this work.

04:46.701 --> 04:47.994
Thanks.

04:48.744 --> 04:51.456
So, think you can do something
with this mug?

04:51.539 --> 04:53.291
Oh, I can certainly try.

04:57.795 --> 05:00.715
- My sister'd die if she knew where I was.
- Oh, really? Why?

05:01.257 --> 05:04.760
She's the actress in the family,
or wants to be.

05:05.177 --> 05:08.139
Every once in a while
I catch her thanking the Academy.

05:10.433 --> 05:12.184
<i>For some strange reason
Keep It Together</i>

05:12.268 --> 05:15.146
- is still her favorite show.
- Oh, not yours, huh?

05:15.229 --> 05:19.442
Well, I haven't checked it out lately,
like, since I was about 10.

05:19.942 --> 05:22.486
But it used to be one of those
squeaky-clean shows

05:22.570 --> 05:25.448
where by some miracle
every problem got solved

05:25.573 --> 05:27.575
just in time for the last commercial.

05:27.658 --> 05:29.869
- You sound like the critics.
- Hey, no offence,

05:29.952 --> 05:32.705
but as far as I can tell,
the only good thing about the show

05:32.788 --> 05:34.373
is Lydia Leeds.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.502
Anyone ever tell you
you kind of look like her?

05:38.586 --> 05:39.753
All the time.

05:41.046 --> 05:43.090
Wait a second, are you...

05:44.133 --> 05:46.844
- Lydia, rehearsal!
- Tell them I'll be just a minute.

05:46.927 --> 05:51.390
- I have to finish... What's your name?
- Brandon. Brandon Walsh.

05:51.974 --> 05:53.892
Mr Walsh's highlights.

05:53.976 --> 05:57.229
And I didn't do his lips yet.

05:59.481 --> 06:01.442
All right, here's the scene.

06:01.567 --> 06:05.070
You skate by, you notice Lydia,
and so you stop, you come back,

06:05.154 --> 06:06.613
and then you say your line,

06:06.697 --> 06:08.282
"Hey, babe,
I like your looks, yadda yadda."

06:08.365 --> 06:11.535
But then, you have to hold
for a count of three.

06:11.827 --> 06:13.078
Can you handle that?

06:13.579 --> 06:14.746
Good.

06:15.038 --> 06:17.416
All right people, let's try this!

06:19.418 --> 06:21.295
Everybody quiet, please!

06:22.337 --> 06:23.630
Roll sound!

06:24.172 --> 06:25.382
Marker.

06:26.258 --> 06:27.342
Action!

06:27.426 --> 06:29.970
Bye! See you later.

06:34.391 --> 06:38.562
Hey, babe, looking good.
Real good, babe.

06:42.190 --> 06:43.483
Really?

06:44.025 --> 06:47.028
Cut! That was terrific.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.905
All right, print.

06:50.448 --> 06:52.742
You know, this kid
is as good-looking as Sean.

06:52.826 --> 06:56.913
- And the princess seems to like him.
- Yeah.

06:57.455 --> 07:01.293
<i>So, here I totally ragged on her show,
and she didn't even hold it against me.</i>

07:02.585 --> 07:05.130
In fact, she was really cool about it.

07:05.213 --> 07:07.841
<i>I cannot believe that you're going to be
on Keep It Together.</i>

07:07.924 --> 07:11.094
- Oh, Paula is gonna flip.
- I'll get it.

07:11.720 --> 07:15.306
- So, what was it like?
- It was fun.

07:16.057 --> 07:18.268
I don't know if I'd want to do it every day.

07:18.393 --> 07:21.813
- I would.
- It's for you. The production office.

07:21.896 --> 07:25.316
Oh, yeah, I think I forgot to sign
a form before I left.

07:25.859 --> 07:27.986
Hey, tell them
that you have a twin sister.

07:28.111 --> 07:30.321
<i>So which one is Keep It Together?</i>

07:30.405 --> 07:34.117
Oh, you know, it's the one about
that cute little orphan girl, Flipper.

07:34.534 --> 07:37.328
Mom, it's Skipper,
and she's not an orphan anymore.

07:37.412 --> 07:40.123
She finally got adopted
by the Carswell-Smythe family.

07:40.415 --> 07:42.291
Sorry. Sheesh.

07:42.417 --> 07:44.919
Great. I'll be there.

07:49.966 --> 07:52.301
So, is there a part for Brenda in it?

07:54.178 --> 07:57.723
- Actually, they have a part for me.
- Yeah, right.

07:57.974 --> 07:59.308
I'm not kidding.

08:03.479 --> 08:06.857
He has all the luck. It is so sickening.

08:07.191 --> 08:08.651
And now the producers love him.

08:08.734 --> 08:10.194
I mean, they're writing new scenes
for him.

08:10.486 --> 08:11.779
Are you serious?

08:12.363 --> 08:15.157
Yeah, he's like this new guest star
in their next episode,

08:15.241 --> 08:17.451
and Lydia Leeds is his new best friend.

08:17.535 --> 08:20.538
Oh, she used to be really sweet,
but I bet she's totally stuck-up now.

08:20.621 --> 08:23.457
- You know her?
- We were all in the 5th grade together.

08:24.625 --> 08:27.086
This is so poetically unjust.

08:27.378 --> 08:29.046
I mean, he gets to miss school
and everything,

08:29.130 --> 08:30.631
and he doesn't even like the show.

08:30.714 --> 08:32.299
Oh, well, I bet he does now.

08:32.842 --> 08:34.135
I need a bubble bath.

08:39.682 --> 08:42.851
Brenda, listen, there was one little thing

08:42.934 --> 08:44.770
I was hoping
you could help me out with.

08:45.229 --> 08:47.147
I need someone to cover for me
at the Peach Pit.

08:47.231 --> 08:51.694
Someone I trust to give me the job back
after this acting thing plays itself out.

08:52.486 --> 08:55.823
So, in other words, while you get to be
on TV with Lydia Leeds,

08:55.906 --> 09:00.119
I get to serve pie to the...
What did you call them last week?

09:00.202 --> 09:02.996
Oh, yes, the "tightwads of America."

09:04.081 --> 09:06.834
Come on, Bren.
The tips aren't usually that bad,

09:06.917 --> 09:08.836
and it's really an easy job.

09:08.919 --> 09:11.755
Oh, that's why you always come home
exhausted and smelly.

09:11.839 --> 09:14.508
Besides, Nat wouldn't even hire me.
I mean, I don't have any experience.

09:14.591 --> 09:16.301
Let me worry about Nat, okay?

09:16.677 --> 09:19.429
No, you better worry about finding
a different replacement.

09:20.847 --> 09:24.768
You know, Bren, I told them about you,
but they needed a guy.

09:24.893 --> 09:28.146
<i>Of course they need a guy.
Don't you ever read TV Guide?</i>

09:28.355 --> 09:31.316
Sean Judson is leaving the show
over a salary dispute.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.318
Well, I'm no Sean Judson.

09:34.403 --> 09:36.321
You said it, I didn't.

09:38.448 --> 09:41.451
Come on, Bren,
can't you do me a favor?

09:43.829 --> 09:45.455
And what will you do for me?

09:49.209 --> 09:51.670
Okay, okay. How about this?

09:52.087 --> 09:55.257
You're always complaining about how
you don't have enough room in here.

09:55.465 --> 09:57.592
You can have the top two drawers.

09:59.135 --> 10:02.681
- Well, that's a start.
- What else do you want?

10:03.848 --> 10:07.519
- I want your green shirt.
- My green shirt?

10:08.269 --> 10:11.773
The one shirt in the whole world
that I own that I really love?

10:11.856 --> 10:13.650
That green shirt?

10:13.733 --> 10:16.694
That's the one. Take it or leave it.

10:24.953 --> 10:25.995
There you go.

10:26.079 --> 10:27.497
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.999
I knew from the first night
you walked in with Dylan.

10:30.083 --> 10:32.919
I said to myself,
"Nat, this kid's a comer."

10:33.044 --> 10:37.006
- Didn't I say that, Sal?
- Nat, it's only a small part.

10:37.382 --> 10:40.301
There are no small parts,
only small actors.

10:40.635 --> 10:42.428
So what about Brenda here?

10:42.512 --> 10:45.264
Well, she obviously got
all the looks in the family.

10:46.057 --> 10:48.351
Are you sure
you want to have dishpan hands?

10:48.434 --> 10:50.478
- Well...
- Oh, she'll be great, Nat.

10:50.561 --> 10:53.731
- The customers will love her.
- Sure you can handle it, doll?

10:53.815 --> 10:57.652
Hey, it'll only be for a couple of days.
A week at the most, maybe two.

10:57.735 --> 11:01.155
Wait a minute, don't sell yourself short.
You don't know what it's gonna be.

11:01.239 --> 11:05.660
- Your career could take off.
- His career? What career?

11:05.785 --> 11:08.996
The important thing for you
to remember is when you're a star,

11:09.080 --> 11:11.624
don't let all the Hollywood hoopla
go to your head.

11:11.707 --> 11:14.752
There's no need to worry about that.
I know who I am.

11:14.835 --> 11:17.880
Brandon Walsh,
a regular kind of guy from Minnesota,

11:17.964 --> 11:20.132
and nothing's gonna change that at all.

11:28.015 --> 11:30.184
It'll just be a couple
of routine questions,

11:30.267 --> 11:32.770
like, "What's your favorite color"

11:32.853 --> 11:34.605
or "What'd you have
for breakfast this morning?"

11:34.688 --> 11:37.650
I really think it's premature
to be interviewing me, David.

11:38.484 --> 11:43.364
- Okay, well, we'll do it next period.
- David, don't be ridiculous.

11:43.739 --> 11:46.075
I worked for one day. I said one line.

11:46.158 --> 11:48.911
West Beverly is loaded with kids
who grew up in the industry.

11:50.537 --> 11:52.831
But none of them have worked
with Lydia Leeds.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.042
Then why don't you interview her?

11:55.501 --> 11:57.586
Well, can you get her
to come on my show?

11:58.587 --> 12:01.131
I'll put in a good word for you, okay?

12:01.340 --> 12:03.801
Thanks, big guy. Ciao.

12:09.431 --> 12:12.184
Let's hear it for Brandon Walsh
for landing a role

12:12.267 --> 12:17.147
<i>on the hit series Keep It Together,
starring Lydia "The Love Cat" Leeds.</i>

12:17.231 --> 12:20.859
A boffo socko match in the making.
This one's for you, big guy.

12:24.321 --> 12:27.491
- Hey, Bran, who's your agent?
- Give me a break.

12:27.574 --> 12:29.534
It looks to me like you already got one.

12:30.535 --> 12:33.121
Forget the agent.
What you need is a bodyguard.

12:33.288 --> 12:34.998
Is this weird or what?

12:37.626 --> 12:40.754
- They won't stampede, will they?
- Only if they smell fear.

12:41.797 --> 12:45.008
- What are we gonna do?
- Brenda, how hard can it be?

12:45.092 --> 12:47.260
The fork goes on the left,
the knife and spoon go on the right,

12:47.344 --> 12:49.429
and the napkins go in the dispenser.

12:49.513 --> 12:52.224
Yeah, well, maybe you should be
filling in for Brandon.

12:53.308 --> 12:54.810
Speak of the devil.

12:56.937 --> 12:58.563
This is so unfair.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.398
You know,
I'm the one with all the talent.

13:00.482 --> 13:03.652
I'm the one who used to dance around
the living room singing show tunes.

13:03.735 --> 13:07.113
Oh, I did that, too,
but I was always off key.

13:07.405 --> 13:10.450
I was even thinking of putting
together a stand-up comedy routine.

13:10.533 --> 13:14.746
- I would die first. You'd be so exposed.
- But you play somebody else.

13:16.122 --> 13:17.332
You're a character.

13:17.415 --> 13:19.834
And you're not really you.
Do you see what I mean?

13:19.918 --> 13:22.796
Like, wow, like, for sure,
it's, like, totally radical.

13:23.463 --> 13:25.090
- That's great.
- Do some more.

13:25.173 --> 13:26.466
Okay, okay.

13:26.925 --> 13:30.386
Oh, quit busting my chops.
I'm sick of sitting around here

13:30.512 --> 13:32.889
jawboning with you guys,
you know what I mean?

13:32.972 --> 13:34.140
Stop.

13:36.267 --> 13:38.561
Last week they didn't even know
I was alive.

13:38.686 --> 13:41.105
Last week you weren't hanging out
with Lydia Leeds.

13:41.189 --> 13:43.274
What's the big deal?
You guys know her.

13:44.108 --> 13:45.193
Knew her.

13:45.276 --> 13:47.612
Show biz kids
live in their own little world.

13:47.695 --> 13:49.781
Yeah, well, that'll never happen to me.

13:51.157 --> 13:54.452
Brandon, your limousine's here.

13:58.081 --> 14:00.166
Take care of these for me, would you?

14:13.179 --> 14:14.388
Oh, it's Lydia Leeds!

14:14.472 --> 14:15.681
Hi, Brandon.

14:15.765 --> 14:17.850
He's so lucky. Wow!

14:17.934 --> 14:19.352
Hi, Lydia.

14:43.793 --> 14:45.961
Don't forget.
Soak the puppy chow really well.

14:46.045 --> 14:48.172
He likes it soft and mushy.

14:48.756 --> 14:50.257
There you go.

14:51.133 --> 14:55.679
Oh, my doggie's only six weeks old.
I miss him so much.

14:56.805 --> 14:58.849
How many of those do you think
you've signed in your life?

14:58.933 --> 15:00.517
About six gadjillion.

15:00.601 --> 15:02.895
Doesn't it bother you,
people just coming up to you?

15:02.978 --> 15:04.521
It would bother me if they didn't.

15:04.605 --> 15:06.649
- You mind?
- Oh, not at all.

15:07.024 --> 15:09.109
Oh, no, you don't want my autograph.

15:09.193 --> 15:11.403
Come on, Brandon, better get used to it.

15:11.737 --> 15:13.822
- What are you talking about?
- You don't get it, do you?

15:13.906 --> 15:15.240
With Sean being written out
of the show,

15:15.324 --> 15:17.117
you could be a recurring character.

15:17.201 --> 15:19.578
I thought people were supposed to
pound the pavement for years

15:19.661 --> 15:21.872
- before they got a break like this.
- Don't you believe in fate?

15:21.955 --> 15:24.374
You were at the right place
at the right time.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.586
- And that's it?
- And you got a good look.

15:28.921 --> 15:32.341
- But it's not for sure, right?
- Let me put it this way,

15:32.758 --> 15:35.469
I don't make a habit
of giving people rides to the set.

15:39.222 --> 15:40.682
Need some help with that?

15:43.602 --> 15:45.270
Okay, here we are.

15:46.271 --> 15:47.689
Now... Thank you.

15:47.856 --> 15:50.400
It's a party in the next room.
You see each other,

15:50.484 --> 15:52.277
you want each other,
you get each other.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.948
Now, I want it juicy, but not too juicy.
Big, but not over-the-top.

15:57.365 --> 16:01.786
But lots of heat. Got to feel the heat.
Make me sweat.

16:02.245 --> 16:03.872
Okay, let's do it.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.167
Roll sound! Speed.

16:07.626 --> 16:08.877
Marker.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.921
And action.

16:17.886 --> 16:19.596
I was hoping you'd be here.

16:29.397 --> 16:33.651
Cut! Print. That was brilliant. Perfect.
Don't change a thing.

16:34.944 --> 16:36.821
All right, let's do another one.

16:37.405 --> 16:39.491
If it was perfect,
why are we doing it again?

16:39.574 --> 16:41.701
Jake likes to get a lot of coverage.

16:44.162 --> 16:45.538
And action!

16:47.749 --> 16:49.417
I was hoping you'd be here.

16:56.341 --> 16:57.550
Cut. Print.

16:57.634 --> 16:58.760
Action!

16:58.843 --> 17:00.428
I was hoping you'd be here.

17:03.514 --> 17:05.892
- Wait, Brandon's stepping on my toe.
- Sorry.

17:05.974 --> 17:07.060
Cut!

17:07.143 --> 17:08.770
I was hoping you'd be here.

17:13.357 --> 17:14.442
Cut.

17:14.525 --> 17:15.693
It was terrible.

17:15.776 --> 17:16.986
Marker.

17:17.278 --> 17:19.488
- Cut.
- That was nice.

17:19.571 --> 17:20.615
Mark.

17:22.491 --> 17:23.617
Cut.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.202
Cut.

17:25.912 --> 17:26.954
Cut.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.915
Print. That's a wrap.

17:30.124 --> 17:32.835
- Good work, Lydia. That was very nice.
- Thanks.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.923
- Well, I could get used to this.
- So could I.

17:44.680 --> 17:48.434
Anyway, the director said
I was a natural.

17:48.726 --> 17:50.686
Honey, that's great.
Are you working tomorrow?

17:50.769 --> 17:53.647
Yeah, but I got a late call.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.858
You know, they shoot these things
out of order.

17:55.941 --> 17:59.904
And every scene has a number.
It's very complicated.

18:00.029 --> 18:02.823
Yes, well, not as fascinating
as one would've thought.

18:02.907 --> 18:05.409
Excuse me, I have to go change
and get grubby now.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.411
Hey, say hi to Nat for me.

18:07.870 --> 18:09.038
Oh, I got to get changed, too.

18:09.121 --> 18:12.624
Brandon, I don't think you should be
going out to a party on a weeknight.

18:12.708 --> 18:17.296
Dad, it's not a party.
It's a networking thing.

18:17.546 --> 18:20.632
It's a place where a lot of young actors
go to get away from the crowds

18:20.716 --> 18:22.259
and the media and stuff.

18:23.010 --> 18:24.470
Don't you have to get ready
for tomorrow?

18:24.553 --> 18:25.929
I got my lines down.

18:26.847 --> 18:27.931
What about school?

18:28.015 --> 18:31.101
Dad, I told you,
they have a teacher on set.

18:31.685 --> 18:33.228
She's very scholastic.

18:33.437 --> 18:35.772
<i>She's writing a spec script
for Twin Peaks.</i>

18:37.900 --> 18:42.529
- Is that Lydia?
- She's early and I'm not ready. Stall.

18:46.033 --> 18:47.409
I'll go get the camera.

18:53.498 --> 18:54.791
That's my drawer.

18:55.417 --> 18:58.628
- God. Can I borrow one of your combs?
- No.

19:02.090 --> 19:04.551
So, you want me to introduce you
to Lydia?

19:04.634 --> 19:06.428
- Don't do me any favors.
- Fine.

19:06.511 --> 19:08.263
Just let Mom and Dad embarrass me.

19:10.307 --> 19:11.892
You mean she's here?

19:12.809 --> 19:16.021
Lydia Leeds is here? Downstairs?
In this house?

19:16.563 --> 19:19.858
Yeah. Go talk to her, will you?

19:20.942 --> 19:22.736
What do I say to her?

19:23.028 --> 19:26.364
Brenda, she's just a regular person.

19:33.580 --> 19:37.542
Oh, my business manager used to be
with Hartley and Mather, too.

19:37.625 --> 19:40.378
Really? What's his name?

19:40.753 --> 19:43.923
- Joey Merlis.
- I've met him, I've met him.

19:44.007 --> 19:46.384
Jim, where's the film for the camera?

19:46.801 --> 19:49.929
This is Brandon's better half.
Brenda, this is Lydia.

19:51.014 --> 19:53.224
- I know that, Dad.
- Jim.

19:54.058 --> 19:57.020
- Oh, excuse me. Nice to meet you.
- Oh, bye.

19:58.855 --> 20:01.190
- Hi.
- Hello.

20:05.361 --> 20:08.072
- So we have a friend in common.
- Oh, who's that?

20:08.156 --> 20:09.449
Kelly Taylor.

20:11.743 --> 20:12.785
Who?

20:13.244 --> 20:14.787
From elementary school?

20:15.955 --> 20:19.625
- Kelly Taylor? Donna Martin?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, right, right.

20:20.376 --> 20:23.754
So, Brandon tells me that you have
some acting aspirations.

20:24.130 --> 20:27.216
<i>Well, yeah, I was Juliet
in Romeo and Juliet.</i>

20:27.675 --> 20:30.970
- In stock?
- No, 7th grade.

20:31.262 --> 20:32.305
Oh.

20:32.388 --> 20:34.140
Not that what you do
when you're 12 years old

20:34.223 --> 20:35.391
really matters that much.

20:35.808 --> 20:39.353
<i>When I was 12 years old,
I got my second TV Guide cover,</i>

20:39.437 --> 20:42.023
and my first Golden Globe Award.

20:43.441 --> 20:45.860
Well, I can't top that now, can I?

20:47.069 --> 20:50.948
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

20:51.031 --> 20:53.742
- Oh, I love your shirt.
- Thanks.

21:10.926 --> 21:12.136
Miss!

21:13.804 --> 21:16.390
Excuse me, did you order
the cheeseburger, medium-well

21:16.473 --> 21:18.976
with no onions or the grilled cheese
with bacon and tomato?

21:19.268 --> 21:23.564
- I ordered soup.
- Of course. I'll be right back.

21:23.939 --> 21:27.317
Miss.
Miss, I asked for some water, please.

21:27.401 --> 21:29.278
Right. Water on four.

21:30.028 --> 21:33.157
- Brenda, I need a set-up on eight.
- Right. Set-up on eight.

21:33.240 --> 21:36.785
- Ketchup on seven.
- Sure. Ketchup on seven.

21:37.286 --> 21:41.665
Right, okay. All right, here we go.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.960
All right, water on four.

21:45.586 --> 21:48.005
Set-up on eight and ketchup on seven.

21:48.088 --> 21:51.591
That's water on four, set-up on ketchup,
and seven on eight...

21:52.551 --> 21:54.136
- Brenda!
- What?

21:54.219 --> 21:56.888
- How are you doing? You're okay?
- Great. I'm great.

21:57.055 --> 21:59.725
Good. Pick up your order,
'cause it's ready. Come on.

22:00.142 --> 22:01.685
Just great.

22:02.728 --> 22:05.731
Okay, all right.

22:10.569 --> 22:12.904
Okay, sir, here we go.

22:24.416 --> 22:26.084
Hi, honey.

22:28.753 --> 22:31.089
You know, I keep thinking
everyone in here looks familiar,

22:31.172 --> 22:34.467
but then I realize, of course they are,
they're all on TV.

22:35.593 --> 22:37.595
Oh, Peter Bremmer.

22:37.971 --> 22:40.056
<i>- Wasn't he on Kibbee and Me?
- He was,</i>

22:40.140 --> 22:43.893
but the show got cancelled.
He's so depressed, it's pathetic.

22:44.894 --> 22:47.313
- Hi, Lydia.
- Hi, Mackenzie.

22:47.397 --> 22:50.316
So, who's the new
flavor-of-the-week?

22:50.400 --> 22:53.528
- Very funny, Mackenzie.
- Have fun while it lasts.

22:53.611 --> 22:55.530
Goodbye, Mackenzie.

22:59.367 --> 23:01.703
You just met the luckiest girl
in this town.

23:01.786 --> 23:05.081
And the only reason she has a career
is because her uncle

23:05.164 --> 23:07.000
is, like, this really big producer.

23:07.083 --> 23:12.005
Let me ask you something.
Is there anybody here you like?

23:13.297 --> 23:16.426
You know, you don't strike me like
a kid from Beverly Hills High School.

23:16.509 --> 23:19.262
Well, maybe that's because I go
to West Beverly.

23:20.388 --> 23:24.142
Listen, I hope I didn't come off
like too much of a rank amateur today.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.186
At what, acting or kissing?

23:27.436 --> 23:31.148
- Well, I've been told I know how to kiss.
- Well, I'd have to agree with that.

23:32.358 --> 23:36.654
But it's so strange to do it
with all those people looking at you.

23:36.737 --> 23:41.284
Yeah. You know, my first kiss ever
was on the show four years ago.

23:43.369 --> 23:44.620
Really?

23:45.079 --> 23:48.541
Yeah, with Sean, in fact.
And every talk show host

23:48.624 --> 23:51.836
kept asking me about it.
It was so embarrassing.

23:52.044 --> 23:53.921
I would've told them to take a flyer.

23:54.004 --> 23:56.465
You can't do that if you want to be
loved by the public.

23:56.549 --> 23:58.259
Is that what you want?

23:58.342 --> 24:00.761
What I want is to be respected
as an actress,

24:00.845 --> 24:03.013
and to feel satisfied with myself
as a person

24:03.097 --> 24:05.683
when this whole roller coaster ride
comes to an end.

24:06.934 --> 24:11.230
- That's very insightful.
- Thanks. My publicist wrote it.

24:13.232 --> 24:15.484
- You want to dance?
- Absolutely.

24:15.568 --> 24:16.944
Come on.

24:39.550 --> 24:41.552
So what do you do with your free time?

24:42.094 --> 24:44.137
Well, I don't have much free time.

24:48.559 --> 24:52.020
...on Saturday.
Then I play hockey on Sunday.

24:52.104 --> 24:54.147
- Would you do me a favor?
- What?

24:54.856 --> 24:57.109
Yeah. Yes, I would.

24:57.192 --> 25:01.238
Why don't you ask me if I'd like to
go watch sometime, all right?

25:01.321 --> 25:03.824
Yeah. If you want to.

25:06.576 --> 25:08.662
- Hi, Sean.
- What's up?

25:09.121 --> 25:12.916
Lydia's here with your competition.

25:30.809 --> 25:34.229
It's definitely better without
those lights in your face.

25:48.326 --> 25:51.037
It's your shirt. I just borrowed it.

25:51.162 --> 25:53.748
Well, you can keep it because
I'm never going back there again.

25:53.832 --> 25:57.085
- Brenda, you can't do that to Nat.
- Nat won't miss me at all, believe me.

25:57.168 --> 25:59.796
- Please, Brenda, just one more night.
- Why?

25:59.879 --> 26:01.839
So you can go network
with the brat pack?

26:01.965 --> 26:04.175
What are you saying,
I've gone Hollywood?

26:04.509 --> 26:06.052
If the shirt fits.

26:07.095 --> 26:09.597
Look, Brenda,
just because the new lady in my life

26:09.681 --> 26:12.809
happens to be in the public eye
doesn't mean that I've changed.

26:12.892 --> 26:14.852
The old Brandon would never
fall head over heels

26:14.936 --> 26:17.647
for such a superficial,
self-centered snob,

26:17.730 --> 26:19.982
who changes boyfriends
on a weekly basis.

26:20.066 --> 26:22.735
What, do you believe everything
you read in the tabloids?

26:22.819 --> 26:25.822
No, but I don't have
stars in my eyes, either.

26:26.322 --> 26:30.284
This is really bogus. I can't deal
with you if you're gonna be like this.

26:30.993 --> 26:33.412
If you don't want to work
at the Peach Pit, fine.

26:33.496 --> 26:36.123
If you want to pick a fight with me
because you're jealous, fine.

26:36.207 --> 26:38.918
Just don't go slamming somebody
you don't even know.

26:40.753 --> 26:42.838
As if you know her so well.

26:43.798 --> 26:47.885
- I know her better than you think.
- You've changed, Brandon.

26:48.886 --> 26:50.554
You really have changed.

26:51.389 --> 26:54.016
Yeah, well, maybe it's for the better.

26:59.063 --> 27:01.273
For two days,
every time I walk down the hall,

27:01.357 --> 27:03.150
somebody stops me
to talk about Brandon.

27:03.234 --> 27:05.194
And Brandon only wants
to talk about Lydia,

27:05.277 --> 27:07.113
and then he accuses me
of being jealous.

27:07.196 --> 27:10.991
- Well, I would be.
- I'm too angry to be jealous.

27:11.075 --> 27:13.077
I mean, he wrangles me
into taking over his job,

27:13.160 --> 27:15.955
his boss thinks I'm a stupid klutz,
and the customers hate me

27:16.038 --> 27:18.707
because they think I'm too young
and inexperienced.

27:18.791 --> 27:21.794
- Brenda, I'm sure they don't hate you.
- Well, they sure act like it.

27:21.877 --> 27:23.837
Well, I think they act that way
because they're hungry.

27:23.921 --> 27:27.591
Oh, hungry people are notorious
for being rude and obnoxious.

27:28.217 --> 27:31.303
Whenever I get around that place
I get very self-conscious.

27:31.387 --> 27:32.554
So quit.

27:33.097 --> 27:36.308
And give Brandon the satisfaction?
No, thanks.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.519
Brenda, try not to take it so seriously.

27:38.602 --> 27:41.605
What am I supposed to do?
Pretend like I know what I'm doing?

27:57.663 --> 28:00.040
Walsh just arrived. I'll send him down.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.459
Here's some new pages.
They need you in make-up.

28:02.542 --> 28:05.128
Whoa. Hey, this is a whole new scene.
What happened to 46?

28:05.212 --> 28:07.839
- Forty-six was cut.
- That's my big scene.

28:07.923 --> 28:09.841
Lydia, Sean and Jake
are waiting for you.

28:09.925 --> 28:12.094
- Hey, Lydia.
- Oh, hi, Brandon.

28:12.177 --> 28:13.804
Hi. They cut our scene.

28:13.887 --> 28:15.972
Oh, I know.
They're rewriting the whole script.

28:16.056 --> 28:18.350
- I'm late. I gotta go.
- Oh, hey, wait a sec.

28:19.684 --> 28:22.771
- I had a really good time last night.
- Hey, Lyd, move your butt.

28:22.896 --> 28:25.065
Jake's hemorrhaging.
He wants us to run lines.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.527
What's he doing here?

28:28.610 --> 28:31.279
Oh, Sean decided to come to terms
with the producers.

28:31.655 --> 28:34.157
He said he missed me. Bye.

28:46.795 --> 28:48.463
- Would you like some more coffee?
- Love some.

28:48.546 --> 28:50.173
- Little slow?
- The pits.

28:55.720 --> 28:59.140
- Brenda?
- No, Brenda couldn't make it.

28:59.641 --> 29:03.019
I'm Laverne. I'm taking her shift.
Charmed, I'm sure.

29:05.522 --> 29:09.275
Girls, girls, come on in.
Don't be bashful. Have a seat.

29:09.359 --> 29:11.819
Oh, but first, let's get some
hit parade action going.

29:11.903 --> 29:13.238
Liven up the joint.

29:13.446 --> 29:16.366
You know,
G5 comes very highly recommended.

29:16.449 --> 29:18.826
- Love your do, Laverne.
- Oh, thank you, blondie.

29:18.910 --> 29:22.246
You know if you play your cards right,
I just might let you borrow my curlers.

29:22.997 --> 29:27.293
Sir, welcome. I'm Laverne.

29:27.377 --> 29:28.795
Charmed, I'm sure.

29:28.878 --> 29:32.381
- I don't get it. What is it, Halloween?
- Hey, don't you worry, pops.

29:32.465 --> 29:36.511
You get no trick or treat with this
little lady. I'm strictly a class act.

29:36.594 --> 29:40.848
A 100% US Certified
hostess with the mostest.

29:42.433 --> 29:45.561
See, here's a gentleman
who appreciates fine beauty.

29:45.645 --> 29:47.647
Here's a customer
who needs an order taken.

29:47.813 --> 29:50.107
Why, certainly.
Would you like to hear today's specials?

29:50.191 --> 29:53.611
- We don't have any specials.
- The special pasta today is spaghetti.

29:53.694 --> 29:57.782
It has meatballs on it
with a red sauce. I think it's tomato.

29:57.865 --> 30:00.034
And the soup is vegetable
with beefy beef.

30:00.117 --> 30:03.204
Very tasty with saltines.
And for dessert we have pie.

30:03.287 --> 30:06.582
We have peach pie, cherry pie,
apple pie, pecan pie, lemon pie,

30:06.665 --> 30:08.375
cream pie, and honey pie.

30:08.459 --> 30:10.753
But if you want pizza pie,
you gotta go across the street.

30:10.836 --> 30:13.547
Ask for Guido. He'll take care of ya.
So what will it be?

30:14.256 --> 30:16.091
Anything you want, sweetheart.

30:18.135 --> 30:22.723
You look like meatloaf
and mashed potatoes. Am I wrong?

30:22.848 --> 30:24.266
Bring it on.

30:24.350 --> 30:26.644
Only if you promise to save room
for dessert.

30:26.769 --> 30:30.731
Okay, we got a taker for
squished taters and a beefy roll.

30:30.940 --> 30:34.401
- We what?
- Mashed potatoes and meatloaf.

30:34.610 --> 30:36.570
Get with the lingo, pops.

30:36.654 --> 30:39.531
Brenda, you're too much.

30:39.615 --> 30:42.117
It's Laverne, thank you.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.707
All right. All right, let's try this, please.

30:49.416 --> 30:53.837
- Jake, his hand was on her shoulder.
- Your hand was on her shoulder.

30:53.921 --> 30:55.881
- The other hand.
- Oh, sorry.

30:56.298 --> 30:59.176
All right? All right, this is for picture.

30:59.343 --> 31:01.220
Everybody quiet, please!

31:02.596 --> 31:04.348
- Roll sound!
- Speed.

31:04.431 --> 31:05.515
Marker.

31:05.641 --> 31:06.892
And action!

31:12.439 --> 31:14.399
Hey, cheesemeister,

31:15.734 --> 31:17.611
stay away from my girl.

31:24.367 --> 31:25.535
Cut!

31:26.077 --> 31:28.330
Brandon, you lost your concentration.

31:28.413 --> 31:31.541
It's just in rehearsal
there wasn't anything in the glass.

31:31.625 --> 31:33.460
Yeah, well, that was rehearsal.

31:33.793 --> 31:35.795
It's all right. Try it again.

31:37.631 --> 31:39.174
And action!

31:42.510 --> 31:45.847
Hey, cheesemeister,
stay away from my girl!

31:48.892 --> 31:50.352
Who's gonna make me?

31:50.935 --> 31:54.689
Cut. Something's not working for me.

31:56.691 --> 31:58.651
- I need more splash.
- Splash?

31:58.735 --> 32:01.154
- More splash.
- Props, more splash!

32:01.237 --> 32:02.614
And action!

32:04.699 --> 32:07.911
Hey, cheesemeister,
stay away from my girl!

32:16.169 --> 32:17.420
Who's gonna make me?

32:19.005 --> 32:22.383
- Cut!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32:28.681 --> 32:32.101
Honey, I won't be spilling no soup
on you today.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.479
Hey, honey,
you want some more coffee?

32:34.562 --> 32:37.607
All right, got to order up.
You know what I mean?

32:37.690 --> 32:39.525
We got some seats available soon,
you know.

32:39.609 --> 32:42.153
Come on, come on, girls, girls, girls,
how are we doing?

32:42.236 --> 32:44.780
I shouldn't take your money,
but I'm Laverne, I will,

32:44.864 --> 32:45.948
you know what I mean?

32:46.032 --> 32:48.784
Hey, honey. Sweetie, how you doing?
Where you been all my life?

32:48.868 --> 32:51.120
Girls, girls, girls,
you want something to eat or what?

32:51.204 --> 32:53.164
- Well...
- You either gotta order or you go,

32:53.247 --> 32:57.001
you know, that's the way it goes.
Everybody, it's more victims!

32:57.627 --> 32:59.837
Enter at your own risk, fellas!

32:59.920 --> 33:03.466
Hey, there's plenty of seats available.
Just keep your hands off mine,

33:03.549 --> 33:06.510
- you know what I mean?
- That's not what you said last week.

33:06.594 --> 33:09.597
Yeah, well, lies and innuendoes
will get you everywhere.

33:10.973 --> 33:13.059
Brenda Walsh, I knew her when.

33:13.142 --> 33:16.312
- And she's really out there.
- Did you put her up to this, Nat?

33:16.395 --> 33:19.899
No, no, no, no.
Let's give credit where credit is due.

33:20.065 --> 33:24.028
I thought she flipped out,
but everybody's eating it up.

33:24.111 --> 33:26.238
Along with second and thirds.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.534
Don't worry about a thing. All right!

33:31.577 --> 33:33.996
I need a java for the lava,
a fizzer on the rocks,

33:34.079 --> 33:36.040
and a pooch in a pouch for the grouch!

33:36.165 --> 33:38.208
- Laverne?
- Yes, Nathan?

33:38.292 --> 33:42.046
- Where you been all my life?
- I was standing right here, sugar.

33:44.673 --> 33:47.134
No, cut, cut, cut!

33:47.551 --> 33:50.220
Someone dry him off.
Let's try this again.

33:50.721 --> 33:53.182
Where did you find this guy?
He can't even remember his lines.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.851
- Lydia pushed for him.
- Hey, you okayed it.

33:55.934 --> 33:59.229
- Don't start with me, Lydia.
- So get him some idiot cards.

33:59.313 --> 34:02.107
- Wait a second. I'm not an idiot.
- You're not an actor.

34:02.191 --> 34:05.652
Hey, I never said I was.
I'm doing the best job I can here.

34:05.736 --> 34:08.322
You change the lines on me,
you change the rules on me.

34:08.405 --> 34:10.072
I don't know what you people want!

34:10.157 --> 34:13.368
What we want is 10 seconds
of usable film.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.913
Do you think you can manage to get up
for that? Or do I have to recast?

34:47.944 --> 34:51.197
- Hey, no cutting in line, bub.
- Andrea. Hi.

34:51.364 --> 34:52.449
What's going on?

34:52.532 --> 34:54.451
We've been waiting here
for 20 minutes already.

34:54.534 --> 34:56.494
You're kidding.
The service is that slow?

34:56.578 --> 34:58.705
No, it's that entertaining.

36:02.768 --> 36:05.187
Hey, what's it take
to get a seat around here?

36:05.271 --> 36:07.189
You gotta be in tight with the owner
or something?

36:07.273 --> 36:10.109
Hey, hey, hey, if it isn't Mr Hollywood.

36:10.192 --> 36:14.405
- What'd you do to my sister?
- What, you mean Laverne?

36:14.739 --> 36:17.908
Hey, sailor,
when did you blow into town?

36:17.992 --> 36:20.327
- When did you go to Mars?
- Hey.

36:20.411 --> 36:24.123
Everybody, we got a bona fide celebrity
in our midst!

36:24.206 --> 36:28.169
That hot new sensation,
Lydia Leeds' main squeeze,

36:28.252 --> 36:29.336
Brandon Walsh!

36:29.420 --> 36:32.047
Now let's give him
a traditional Peach Pit welcome.

36:37.886 --> 36:40.723
Thanks. I needed that.

36:42.725 --> 36:45.602
Bran, Bran, hey.
Need some ChapStick, Mr Walsh?

36:45.686 --> 36:48.188
Yeah, what is it like kissing
a living legend?

36:48.272 --> 36:50.983
- Not all it's cracked up to be.
- Why not?

36:51.984 --> 36:55.738
Oh, you know, these Hollywood
starlet types. Never satisfied.

36:55.821 --> 36:58.198
Hey, Brandon, before I forget,
I've slotted you to do

36:58.282 --> 37:01.118
<i>a behind-the-scene profile on the set
of Keep It Together.</i>

37:01.201 --> 37:02.995
- Don't hold your breath.
- Yeah, no way.

37:03.078 --> 37:06.665
He's not doing anything for free
when he could be sponging big time

37:06.748 --> 37:08.500
<i>from the Enquirer.</i>

37:08.876 --> 37:13.338
<i>Forget Lydia. I think he should write
My Life With Laverne.</i>

37:14.548 --> 37:19.052
- I barely know the girl.
- I wish I could say that.

37:19.928 --> 37:21.805
- I wonder what's wrong with him.
- I don't know.

37:23.348 --> 37:28.061
- Hey, Brandon, you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:29.271 --> 37:32.691
Hey, what's it take to get a piece of pie
around here anyway, huh?

37:41.908 --> 37:43.702
What a difference a day makes.

37:43.785 --> 37:46.913
Yesterday, I was this close to quitting
and I kept on thinking,

37:46.997 --> 37:49.165
"Why should I let these people
intimidate me?"

37:49.249 --> 37:51.835
And then once Kelly said
"Don't take it so seriously,"

37:51.918 --> 37:55.130
I thought of that waitress that works
at the Big Boy on Hoover Street.

37:55.338 --> 37:58.633
And when I found those old glasses,
Laverne just suddenly showed up.

37:58.717 --> 38:02.345
- Well, it sounds truly inspired.
- And inspiring.

38:02.429 --> 38:05.557
- Brandon never pulled in tips like this.
- Not even close.

38:05.640 --> 38:08.435
- She set an all-time record.
- I don't know about that,

38:08.518 --> 38:10.729
but Nat is really jazzed
about the receipts.

38:11.104 --> 38:13.898
From the way he's talking, it sounds
like this could almost become

38:13.982 --> 38:15.108
a permanent thing.

38:15.191 --> 38:18.653
Well, at least I can help him upgrade
the jukebox and liven up the decor.

38:18.736 --> 38:21.447
Now excuse me,
I have to go stuff my mattress.

38:21.531 --> 38:25.159
I thought surely you'd be hitting
the shopping malls with all that loot.

38:25.535 --> 38:28.121
No, I'm saving up for something special.

38:30.123 --> 38:32.959
With both kids working,
I'm ready for an early retirement.

38:33.751 --> 38:37.046
- How did things go yesterday?
- It went.

38:38.006 --> 38:39.882
It's not as easy as it looks.

38:40.049 --> 38:43.261
- Well, what's on tap for next week?
- Maybe some looping.

38:43.511 --> 38:46.389
- What's looping?
- It's when they fix the soundtrack.

38:46.723 --> 38:49.559
You're starting to sound like an old pro,
a real veteran.

38:50.393 --> 38:51.727
Of which war?

38:58.276 --> 39:01.487
Thanks. Nine times out of 10,
I make that shot.

39:01.571 --> 39:03.239
I believe you.

39:06.367 --> 39:08.786
- Wait a second, are you...
- Yeah.

39:09.203 --> 39:11.497
I phoned your mother,
she told me you'd be here.

39:11.706 --> 39:15.501
I didn't feel like being loved
by the public today.

39:15.668 --> 39:17.628
Well, you came to the right place.

39:17.753 --> 39:20.089
- Hey, I don't deserve that.
- Come on, Lydia.

39:20.172 --> 39:23.551
You used me to get back at Sean.
That's it, plain and simple.

39:23.634 --> 39:26.720
I know it looks that way,
but I'm really not that calculating.

39:27.471 --> 39:28.681
Oh, that's right.

39:29.181 --> 39:32.059
I was in the right place at the right time.

39:32.476 --> 39:35.145
And you think you were my
"flavor of the week"?

39:35.229 --> 39:38.232
- Wasn't I?
- If you were, you think I'd be here?

39:41.151 --> 39:45.072
Brandon, guys try to pick me up
all the time.

39:45.197 --> 39:48.242
I admit, sometimes
I'm not that discriminating,

39:48.867 --> 39:51.453
but you made me feel
like I didn't have to act.

39:51.537 --> 39:54.373
Which is all I've been doing
since I'm 10 years old.

39:54.748 --> 39:56.166
It's hard to figure out who you are

39:56.250 --> 39:58.460
when you're always pretending
to be somebody else.

39:58.544 --> 40:02.548
- Well, I liked the person I thought I met.
- And she liked you.

40:02.923 --> 40:04.967
Until Sean came back in the picture.

40:05.050 --> 40:07.511
Brandon, he was never really gone.

40:07.594 --> 40:10.639
Oh, I see,
so I was the guy on the rebound, huh?

40:10.764 --> 40:13.559
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- Well, how would you put it?

40:14.268 --> 40:18.188
You're the natural from Minnesota
who knows how to kiss.

40:22.651 --> 40:25.904
- So I guess this is it, huh?
- Not necessarily.

40:25.988 --> 40:28.907
Jake loved your dailies,
and he's gonna test market

40:28.991 --> 40:30.993
your character with a target audience.

40:31.159 --> 40:34.663
- You're kidding?
- Nope, they are really high on you.

40:35.372 --> 40:37.290
You know, I did think
we nailed that last take.

40:37.374 --> 40:39.292
I know, so did I.

40:39.960 --> 40:42.671
- So we'll keep in touch?
- Absolutely.

40:42.754 --> 40:43.880
Okay.

40:44.756 --> 40:46.383
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:55.892 --> 40:57.978
What, opening night jitters, big guy?

40:58.186 --> 41:00.981
- Brandon, is this the right channel?
- Yes, Andrea.

41:01.064 --> 41:03.108
Brandon, don't worry about it.
My mom gets the same way

41:03.191 --> 41:05.610
before a show,
but afterwards she'll just pig out.

41:09.239 --> 41:10.407
Brenda's gonna miss it.

41:10.490 --> 41:12.575
She said she was gonna leave
work early.

41:13.118 --> 41:14.494
This is Brandon's big moment.

41:14.577 --> 41:17.163
You'd think she'd make a point
of getting here and supporting him.

41:17.247 --> 41:19.290
Maybe she forgot to tell Laverne.

41:21.584 --> 41:23.002
Oh, here they are!

41:23.128 --> 41:26.089
Hey, way to go, toots.
Nothing like making an entrance.

41:26.172 --> 41:28.967
Hey, I'm charmed, I'm sure.
I didn't miss it, did I?

41:29.050 --> 41:31.678
- You're right on time.
- Oh, have a piece of cake?

41:31.886 --> 41:34.430
- Where's it from?
- Come on, spare us, Kelly.

41:35.890 --> 41:39.727
- So, how are you doing?
- I'm standing.

41:39.978 --> 41:43.773
- How are you doing?
- Well, tips were bountiful, as usual.

41:43.856 --> 41:46.901
<i>I got an ovation for my rendition
of Material Girl.</i>

41:46.984 --> 41:49.070
Oh, and Nat brought along
his portable TV set,

41:49.153 --> 41:50.655
so he won't miss the show.

41:51.322 --> 41:54.492
This is it, you guys. Keep it...
Okay, quiet. Quiet.

41:59.914 --> 42:04.544
- What scene are you in, man?
- It's the one right after this one.

42:04.752 --> 42:08.548
Lydia leaves the party,
she goes in the bedroom, sees me,

42:08.631 --> 42:11.717
and says, "I was hoping you'd be here."

42:12.051 --> 42:13.511
And then...

42:14.762 --> 42:16.305
Well, you'll see.

42:28.192 --> 42:30.069
<i>I was hoping you'd be here.</i>

42:43.541 --> 42:46.126
When did Sean Judson
get back on the show?

42:58.430 --> 43:01.975
Yeah, listen, don't feel bad.

43:02.726 --> 43:04.603
You're paying your dues.
Even my mother's ended up

43:04.686 --> 43:06.188
on the cutting room floor.

43:06.980 --> 43:08.273
Say hi for me.

43:09.483 --> 43:12.194
- All right. Goodnight, Bran.
- Goodnight.

43:12.653 --> 43:16.406
I think you should sue them
for misrepresentation. I really do.

43:18.367 --> 43:21.411
Thanks, Andrea. See you Monday.

43:24.831 --> 43:27.751
You want my honest opinion?
You lucked out.

43:27.918 --> 43:29.211
I wouldn't want my name on that, man.

43:29.294 --> 43:31.421
It's got to be the worst show
on television.

43:31.630 --> 43:35.092
Yeah, well, it's also in the top ten
every week.

43:35.425 --> 43:38.679
Yeah, well,
there's no accounting for taste.

43:41.014 --> 43:42.432
- Bye.
- Bye.

43:43.475 --> 43:46.394
Maybe they'll put your scenes
in next week's episode.

43:46.853 --> 43:49.564
Like deja vu or something.

43:52.859 --> 43:55.654
- Goodnight, Kelly.
- Goodnight, Brandon.

44:10.168 --> 44:12.545
- You want a piece?
- No, thanks.

44:12.629 --> 44:14.756
You know how it is
when you're pushing pies.

44:14.839 --> 44:16.341
You lose your sweet tooth.

44:18.551 --> 44:20.220
You've been awfully quiet.

44:20.303 --> 44:25.225
Are you merely avoiding comment
on one of the most embarrassing,

44:25.308 --> 44:28.061
- most mind-blowing, most...
- Humiliating.

44:28.186 --> 44:29.938
- Degrading.
- But character building.

44:30.021 --> 44:33.358
But not-worth-it experiences
a person can have in a lifetime?

44:33.775 --> 44:36.069
I can't believe Lydia could be so cold.

44:36.444 --> 44:39.697
- Why, because she didn't call?
- Yeah, she should have warned you.

44:39.781 --> 44:43.368
What was she supposed to say?
"Hi, Brandon, it's Lydia.

44:43.451 --> 44:46.871
"Sorry I have to dump on you again,
but, hey, that's showbiz."

44:47.080 --> 44:49.666
Well, you're definitely
more forgiving than I am.

44:50.541 --> 44:51.918
Here you go.

44:54.962 --> 44:56.923
You know, Brenda, I've been thinking.

44:57.882 --> 45:00.259
You should keep the job
at the Peach Pit.

45:00.468 --> 45:02.887
- You've earned it.
- Brandon.

45:03.304 --> 45:04.597
No, look it.

45:05.014 --> 45:07.308
There are other jobs I can find,
other things I can do,

45:07.391 --> 45:09.727
with the school paper
and my hockey game.

45:09.810 --> 45:12.939
- Brandon.
- Take it, Brenda. I'm giving it to you.

45:13.940 --> 45:18.277
Brandon, I don't want it. It's too hard.
It's too exhausting.

45:19.445 --> 45:21.197
Thanks for thinking about me.

45:22.782 --> 45:26.118
Brenda, how can you just walk away?
You're raking in the bucks.

45:26.327 --> 45:29.538
Yeah, but I have enough in my mattress
to pay for what I wanted.

45:29.747 --> 45:31.040
What's that?

45:31.665 --> 45:33.542
Acting lessons.

45:33.876 --> 45:36.295
Brenda, you don't really want to do that,
do you?

45:36.545 --> 45:39.757
No, but Laverne just won't
leave me alone.
