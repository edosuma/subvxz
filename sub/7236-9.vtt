00:05.425 --> 00:07.624
<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:07.939 --> 00:10.842
<i>Clu seized control of the Grid.</i>

00:10.876 --> 00:13.701
<i>And left Tron for dead.</i>

00:13.769 --> 00:16.676
<i>But Tron survived... barely.</i>

00:16.710 --> 00:18.791
That healing
chamber is the only thing

00:18.825 --> 00:20.790
- holding these scars at bay.
- Tron!

00:20.824 --> 00:24.089
<i>Meanwhile, the Renegade continues
to fascinate the public...</i>

00:24.123 --> 00:26.923
I wonder if he's really Tron,
like they're saying.

00:26.957 --> 00:30.059
<i>...and becomes a major torn
in Tesler's side.</i>

00:30.094 --> 00:31.908
<i>Do whatever you have to do...</i>

00:31.942 --> 00:35.099
but bring me the Renegade!

01:40.084 --> 01:43.053
<i>Accessing ship manifest.</i>

01:43.087 --> 01:45.656
<i>Entree granted.</i>

01:45.690 --> 01:47.857
<i>Priority clearance.</i>

02:33.771 --> 02:35.338
Dyson.

02:35.762 --> 02:45.262
<b>S01E09 - Scars, Part 1</b>

03:03.491 --> 03:06.159
<i>Vessel clear.</i>

03:06.193 --> 03:11.332
Who is that? And why don't
we have one of those ships?

03:11.366 --> 03:14.535
- Not that we need one.
- We don't.

03:26.584 --> 03:31.954
Oh, not him...
that vile, two-faced phony.

03:32.189 --> 03:35.157
<i>Dyson!
What a wonderful surprise!</i>

03:35.191 --> 03:39.528
<i>- To what do we owe this pleasure?
- I think you know.</i>

03:41.564 --> 03:45.266
I'm here to fire you...
condemn you to the games.

03:51.172 --> 03:52.439
I'm joking, of course.

03:52.473 --> 03:55.509
Just a customary review
of our satellite ops.

03:55.543 --> 03:59.213
I doubt I'll see anything
to warrant that.

04:01.183 --> 04:03.585
Oh. And there's
also the matter of the...

04:03.619 --> 04:08.390
the... what's his name?
Renegade?

04:08.424 --> 04:12.495
He's nothing. A minor nuisance.

04:12.529 --> 04:16.432
Odd, because Clu hears different.

04:16.466 --> 04:20.269
Well, I'll have to see for myself.

04:23.540 --> 04:28.177
I think I like him as much
as I like the Renegade.

04:28.211 --> 04:31.314
I want you both glued to Dyson
every moment he's here.

04:31.348 --> 04:34.518
Make sure his visit is brief
and uneventful.

04:38.223 --> 04:41.325
Your target. Take a good look.

04:41.359 --> 04:44.495
I could have surveilled him myself.

04:44.529 --> 04:47.264
You didn't have to come out here.

04:47.299 --> 04:49.567
He must be pretty important.

04:49.601 --> 04:52.403
All you need to know is that he's
Clu's highest-ranking soldier,

04:52.437 --> 04:57.541
- and the deadliest.
- Copy that. So what's our plan?

04:57.576 --> 05:01.445
Dyson has vital intel on Clu,
so you're going to capture him,

05:01.480 --> 05:06.518
bring him to the hideout...
where I'll extract it from him.

05:06.552 --> 05:10.155
Well, wouldn't it make more
sense for me to just get his disc?

05:10.189 --> 05:15.328
If I bring him to the lair,
he'll see our operation, see you...

05:15.362 --> 05:18.331
we'd have to de-rez him.

05:18.365 --> 05:22.135
Which is a bad thing. Right?

05:22.170 --> 05:26.207
- Right?
- I have bigger plans for Dyson,

05:26.241 --> 05:28.376
and there's a reason you
don't know the details.

05:28.410 --> 05:32.513
You just have to get him.
Unless you can't handle that.

05:32.547 --> 05:36.116
It's not how I'd do it, but you're Tron.

05:36.150 --> 05:38.151
I just wear the suit.

05:40.521 --> 05:43.289
Your scar...

05:43.323 --> 05:46.525
you've been away from the
healing chamber too long.

05:46.559 --> 05:50.529
Funny... I hadn't noticed.

06:03.578 --> 06:05.181
<i>Just once Dyson,</i>

06:05.216 --> 06:07.448
<i>I wish you'd come to me
when you don't have bad news.</i>

06:07.482 --> 06:11.152
But then I wouldn't be doing my job.

06:14.423 --> 06:19.526
Let me guess.
Another disturbance in the ISO district.

06:21.396 --> 06:26.433
<i>Every since the ISOs showed up,
it's been one incident after the next.</i>

06:26.468 --> 06:29.437
<i>You're talking like we've never
had security problems before.</i>

06:29.471 --> 06:31.439
Programs are written to be competitive.

06:31.473 --> 06:33.408
<i>ISO outbreaks in progress.</i>

06:33.442 --> 06:38.112
But it's different with them.
Nobody knows what these ISOs are.

06:38.146 --> 06:42.850
- They've got the whole city on edge.
- And it's time to take the edge off.

06:44.569 --> 06:46.153
Assemble our team.

06:51.559 --> 06:56.229
Apparently the locals don't like
ISOs moving into their neighborhood,

06:56.263 --> 06:59.598
so we're going to show them that
there's room on the Grid for everyone.

06:59.633 --> 07:02.334
Slap a few wrists, send
a few programs home...

07:02.368 --> 07:05.270
All in a cycle's work.
How would you know, Raines?

07:05.305 --> 07:08.406
You've never worked a cycle
in your life.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.378
<i>I want the crowd
dispersed peacefully.</i>

07:14.412 --> 07:17.548
Under no circumstances
are you to draw your discs.

07:17.582 --> 07:19.350
Understood?

07:19.384 --> 07:21.551
- You want us to go in unarmed?
- For ISOs?

07:21.586 --> 07:24.121
What shall we stop the
mob with? A group hug?

07:24.156 --> 07:27.558
In case you had cubes in our ears.
That was an order!

07:27.593 --> 07:31.395
Now get moving, programs!
On the double!

07:36.368 --> 07:40.204
- Thanks.
- Anytime, old friend.

08:03.228 --> 08:06.430
Freaks! Go back to the
sea you crawled out of!

08:06.464 --> 08:09.133
This is our home too.

08:27.118 --> 08:29.319
- It's Tron.
- It's him!

08:31.388 --> 08:33.489
Look at yourselves!

08:33.523 --> 08:37.193
Flynn intended the Grid
for all programs...

08:37.227 --> 08:39.294
to be shared freely!

08:39.328 --> 08:43.232
Don't dishonor his
vision through violence.

09:00.483 --> 09:03.352
ISOs! It was them!

09:03.386 --> 09:04.586
No. No!

09:07.524 --> 09:10.058
De-rez!!!

09:11.528 --> 09:13.328
Stay back! Get back!

09:13.363 --> 09:15.397
No discs!

09:15.431 --> 09:18.133
Tron said no discs!

09:26.175 --> 09:29.177
Dyson! Pull back!

09:32.115 --> 09:34.283
<i>Dyson!</i>

09:34.317 --> 09:36.151
<i>Dyson...</i>

09:47.165 --> 09:49.232
Welcome to Argon...

09:50.501 --> 09:52.301
...old friend.

09:55.537 --> 09:58.869
- Let's go again.
- Again?

09:59.025 --> 10:01.445
<i>But we've done this
simulation four times.</i>

10:01.507 --> 10:04.680
That's not enough. Again!

10:04.681 --> 10:05.814
Yes, sir.

10:05.849 --> 10:08.684
I can hear you. Focus.

10:13.757 --> 10:18.461
<i>Reloading simulation.
Extraction mode declined.</i>

10:31.709 --> 10:33.710
<i>Rendering Dyson level.</i>

10:33.744 --> 10:36.646
<i>Calibrating for maximum difficulty.</i>

10:43.821 --> 10:45.655
<i>Reconfiguring.</i>

11:02.908 --> 11:04.808
Finish him!

11:12.450 --> 11:13.817
A quaint little burg.

11:19.524 --> 11:23.827
I wonder why Tesler's having so
much trouble getting it in line.

11:27.464 --> 11:31.767
Hmm.
Seems like Tesler's on shaky ground.

11:31.802 --> 11:35.604
You don't think Clu's
considering demoting him?

11:37.741 --> 11:41.577
No, me neither. Of course,
anything goes when you're at the top.

11:41.611 --> 11:44.413
Don't you find politics fascinating?

11:44.448 --> 11:46.549
Nothing you say is fascinating.

11:46.583 --> 11:49.485
Don't be coy. You're ambitious too.

11:49.519 --> 11:52.722
Think about how far up the ladder we
could climb if we had each other's backs.

11:52.756 --> 11:56.393
Can you imagine what you
and I could do... together?

11:56.427 --> 11:58.462
I can, and it makes me sick.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.399
Oops.

12:15.514 --> 12:18.416
ISOs...

12:18.450 --> 12:21.352
like a disease that keeps spreading.

12:21.386 --> 12:25.389
Dyson, stay on mission.
I'm just here to work with Flynn.

12:25.423 --> 12:29.360
I need you to keep this area safe.

12:29.394 --> 12:33.564
Look at them.
Their light lines... it's not right!

12:33.598 --> 12:35.946
And they were never written.
They serve no purpose!

12:35.993 --> 12:40.771
Dyson! We don't know who
threw the first disc that day.

12:40.805 --> 12:44.708
I do. Them.

13:21.713 --> 13:25.449
- Clu.
- I see Flynn's on time.

13:27.786 --> 13:29.453
As usual.

13:32.725 --> 13:34.425
There he is now.

13:44.571 --> 13:47.540
Aren't you both a sight for sore eyes?

13:49.644 --> 13:53.614
We are...
on the eve of something big.

13:53.648 --> 13:59.621
And the key...
the key is the ISOs.

13:59.655 --> 14:03.824
Yes. ISOs.
There's been more unrest.

14:03.858 --> 14:06.593
To, uh, put it mildly.

14:06.627 --> 14:08.462
- Now, Clu...
- Flynn.

14:09.631 --> 14:13.334
I, um... I'm one of
your security programs.

14:13.368 --> 14:15.403
Dyson. I know.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.540
I want you to do
something about those ISOs.

14:18.574 --> 14:24.513
They pervert the Grid,
and they need to be erased from it.

14:24.547 --> 14:29.351
You should know Dyson sustained
that injury in the line of duty.

14:29.385 --> 14:33.388
I understand your need for justice.

14:33.422 --> 14:38.327
But ISOs have just as much
a right to be here as anyone.

14:38.361 --> 14:44.566
The Grid created them... not me.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.402
Now...

14:47.437 --> 14:51.639
who's ready to alter the fabric
of existence as we know it?

15:43.461 --> 15:46.530
<i>Gravity reversal initiated.</i>

15:58.710 --> 16:01.545
<i>Gravity restored.</i>

16:04.716 --> 16:07.718
Look, I know you have your secret
plan that I don't know about.

16:07.752 --> 16:10.520
But I figured that if you
saw I could get your disc,

16:10.554 --> 16:11.794
you'd know I could get Dyson's.

16:11.818 --> 16:15.392
I don't want cheap gimmicks!
I want Dyson!

16:15.426 --> 16:18.696
Don't come back
until he's your prisoner.

16:20.765 --> 16:23.601
- So, that's it?
- No!

16:23.636 --> 16:27.205
If you pull a stunt like
that again, you're out!

16:27.239 --> 16:29.407
I'll wage this revolution
without you!

16:54.122 --> 16:58.859
<i>Sir, I know general Tesler is
eager for you to see the energy plant.</i>

16:58.894 --> 17:04.964
All in good time.
I like to get a feel for the, uh, public.

17:04.999 --> 17:08.068
You seem nervous about something.

17:08.102 --> 17:12.104
- It's not the Renegade business, is it?
- Him? Of course not.

17:12.138 --> 17:15.808
I can assure you the
Renegade is a non-issue.

17:15.842 --> 17:21.212
Well, except for that time he
beheaded Clu's statue and blew it up.

17:24.983 --> 17:30.254
My colleague gets carried away.
At best, the Renegade is a petty vandal.

17:36.261 --> 17:38.095
- What is it?
- Oh...

18:12.196 --> 18:14.230
A smoke bomb.

18:14.264 --> 18:18.167
It's harmless up there, but down here
it would have left us an easy target.

18:18.201 --> 18:20.903
For what, I wonder?

18:20.937 --> 18:26.141
Scour the area!
Whoever did this could still be nearby.

18:26.176 --> 18:29.812
There's only one program
who could have done this.

18:29.846 --> 18:32.849
Let me guess. Your petty vandal?

18:32.884 --> 18:35.052
My colleague is being modest.

18:35.086 --> 18:38.222
The Renegade has actually
built quite a reputation.

18:38.257 --> 18:41.092
Some even say he's Tron.

18:41.126 --> 18:44.028
Oh! Believe me, he's not Tron.

18:44.062 --> 18:47.064
I was there when Tron and
Flynn nearly destroyed the Grid.

18:47.099 --> 18:51.202
- You knew Tron?
- Knew him? Ha!

18:52.905 --> 18:54.272
I watched him die.

19:00.146 --> 19:02.280
<i>Flynn!</i>

19:02.315 --> 19:06.852
<i>Am I still to create the perfect system?</i>

19:06.886 --> 19:07.953
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:11.791 --> 19:12.991
Now.

19:14.894 --> 19:16.995
<i>Flynn, go.</i>

19:37.216 --> 19:39.017
You failed, Clu.

19:39.052 --> 19:42.188
Flynn will vanish,
disappear into the Grid!

19:42.222 --> 19:44.123
He's the creator!

19:44.157 --> 19:49.194
He can go wherever he wants.
It was you I'm after.

19:49.228 --> 19:53.098
Without the mighty Tron,
the creator will fall...

19:53.132 --> 19:56.234
- ...and Clu will rise.
- Dyson!

19:58.070 --> 20:04.275
What do you think, Tron?
I made Dyson perfect again.

20:08.079 --> 20:13.885
Dyson... I trusted you!
He betrayed us!

20:13.919 --> 20:18.122
You're wrong.
Flynn betrayed us...

20:18.156 --> 20:20.825
Betrayed all of us.

20:20.859 --> 20:26.297
Now Clu is free to cleanse
the Grid of the ISOs.

20:45.985 --> 20:48.119
I told you not to come back
empty-handed.

20:49.989 --> 20:51.990
Just answer me one question.

20:52.025 --> 20:55.194
Is this about fighting the
revolution, or de-rezzing Dyson?

20:55.228 --> 20:59.131
This isn't your battle.
Stay out of it!

20:59.366 --> 21:00.933
Hey.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.070
I don't care what you do to me...

21:04.104 --> 21:06.039
I'm not letting you kill for revenge.

21:33.037 --> 21:35.171
I didn't ask your permission.
