MacGYVER:
The first time I got to ride
on a merry-go-round,

01:37.664 --> 01:39.666
I was about six or seven.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.668
I'd never seen
anything like it.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.170
It was a kind of magic.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.673
Go to a merry-go-round
anywhere in the world,

01:46.673 --> 01:49.175
and you can see the same look
in the kids' eyes.

01:49.676 --> 01:50.677
It's magic.

01:52.178 --> 01:55.181
It's a shame we have
to grow up...

01:55.181 --> 01:57.183
and lose it.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.185
(carousel music playing)

02:07.193 --> 02:10.196
And I learned something
up in the Swiss Alps.

02:10.196 --> 02:15.201
I just shouldn't go skiing
without a parachute.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.704
Kind of busted up
my vacation...

02:17.704 --> 02:20.707
and my hand.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.716
So, when I got offered
a free trip

02:29.716 --> 02:32.719
to beautiful Bulgaria,
I grabbed it.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.722
All I had to do
was a little errand.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.224
No sweat.

02:38.224 --> 02:42.729
e.
You should try the
Gregory Mykel endgam

02:42.729 --> 02:44.230
Do you know it?

02:44.230 --> 02:46.232
.
I used to know him

02:46.232 --> 02:47.734
Knight to King's
Bishop Three.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.238
(sighs)

02:53.239 --> 02:55.742
Protect your Queen's right.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.244
It is most important.

02:59.746 --> 03:00.747
Usually is.

03:23.269 --> 03:26.773
Think I'll just mail
this postcard home.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.277
Make a nice souvenir
from my vacation.

03:31.277 --> 03:35.281
We have risked our lives
for what you have.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.291
Checkmate.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.798
Guess you got me.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.300
Thanks for the game.

03:54.300 --> 03:58.805
Tell Dr. Mykel my move
is Bishop to Knight Five.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.809
I'll do that.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.811
I've learned a lot.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.312
(zipping bag)

04:41.848 --> 04:43.850
American?

04:45.351 --> 04:46.352
Yeah.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.854
Oh, you don't know
how good it is

04:47.854 --> 04:49.355
to see someone
from back home.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.857
They're all
foreigners here.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.359
Foreigners?

04:53.359 --> 04:54.861
Sure. Just look around.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.863
I haven't spoken to an American
in over a month.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.365
You know, I thought it was going
to be a trip staying here,

04:59.365 --> 05:00.867
but believe me,
it's not,

05:00.867 --> 05:02.869
especially since I don't
speak the language.

05:02.869 --> 05:03.870
I'm Penny Parker.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.371
You can remember that
'cause it's got

05:05.371 --> 05:07.373
the same letter
at the front of each name.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.875
That's important theatrically,
you know.

05:09.375 --> 05:09.876
Oh, yeah?

05:10.376 --> 05:11.878
Sure. Just think of it--

05:11.878 --> 05:14.881
Farah Fawcett, Tina Turner,
Marilyn Monroe...

05:15.381 --> 05:16.883
er.
Penny Park

05:16.883 --> 05:19.886
Yeah! You catch on quick.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.389
MacGyver.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.892
Did you break your hand?

05:25.892 --> 05:27.894
Does it hurt?
Oh, it must.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.396
I've never broken anything.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.898
It's getting better.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.901
Well, that's good.
Pleased to meet you, MacGyver.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.402
Penny Parker's not my real name,
of course.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.404
I had it changed
when I started modeling.

05:38.404 --> 05:40.406
Really hasn't hurt
my dancing career, either.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.407
That's originally why

05:41.407 --> 05:43.409
I came over here--
to dance, I mean.

05:43.910 --> 05:44.911
You here on business?

05:45.411 --> 05:47.413
My troupe left last month,
but I just couldn't.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.916
I met this man.
He was unreal.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.417
I mean, just to look
at this man was to die.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.419
I had to stay.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.921
Oh, it was awesome

05:54.921 --> 05:56.923
for the first couple weeks,
but then it got kind of...

05:57.423 --> 05:58.424
Difficult?

05:58.424 --> 06:00.927
Yeah. I mean, he was like
my mother or something.

06:00.927 --> 06:01.928
I couldn't go anywhere

06:01.928 --> 06:03.429
or do anything
without him along.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.932
I mean, I like a strong man.
I really do.

06:06.432 --> 06:07.433
So, anyway,
we had this talk.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.936
Well, actually, it was
more of a disagreement.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.938
Well, really,
it was kind of a fight,

06:11.938 --> 06:15.441
and I went blasting off,
and so...

06:15.441 --> 06:16.943
er.
So it's ov

06:16.943 --> 06:17.944
I guess.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.445
You know, you're
very sensitive

06:19.445 --> 06:21.447
to pick that right up.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.454
Uh-oh.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.956
at?
Wh

06:32.959 --> 06:33.960
t?
You all righ

06:33.960 --> 06:37.463
Sure. Um, just hold
my place in line.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.474
You didn't eve
n say good-bye.

06:48.975 --> 06:49.976
Good-bye.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.982
?
Would you gi
ve us some room

06:57.483 --> 07:00.987
?
How can I make
you reconsider

07:01.487 --> 07:02.989
I'm sorry. You can't.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.490
Penny,

07:04.490 --> 07:07.493
I love you to
distraction.
Oh, really.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.995
And just yesterday morning,
you were ready to kill me

07:08.995 --> 07:11.497
just because I smiled
at that nice young officer.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.499
,
Penny, when yo
u smile at a man

07:13.499 --> 07:15.501
nd.
it is already the
beginning of the e

07:15.501 --> 07:16.502
For the man, I mean.

07:16.502 --> 07:19.005
Well, I'm certainly
not going to give up smiling

07:19.005 --> 07:21.507
l.
just so you won't
get upset.
Very wel

07:21.507 --> 07:23.509
l,
I can't hold you
against your wil

07:23.509 --> 07:25.011
but if you
insist on going,

07:25.011 --> 07:26.512
k
I must ask you
to give me bac

07:26.512 --> 07:28.014
u.
the things I gave yo

07:28.014 --> 07:29.515
You mean the jewelry?

07:29.515 --> 07:31.517
Shh, Penny, not so loud.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.519
Well, you gave them to me.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.521
Well, on a
temporary basis,

07:35.521 --> 07:37.523
.
and certainly not
as a farewell gift

07:37.523 --> 07:40.026
.
Penny, I must
have them back

07:40.026 --> 07:42.028
That isn't fair.

07:48.534 --> 07:49.535
?
Where did you put them

07:52.538 --> 07:55.041
(detector buzzing)

07:59.545 --> 08:01.047
Get him!

08:01.047 --> 08:02.548
Wait!

08:22.068 --> 08:25.071
s,
I know you're not
going to believe thi

08:25.071 --> 08:26.572
ea
but I haven't
the slightest id

08:27.073 --> 08:28.074
m.
where those came fro

08:28.074 --> 08:29.575
You're right.
I don't believe you.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.077
Wait a minut
e. Why not?

08:31.577 --> 08:33.578
.
It's the truth

08:38.583 --> 08:40.586
MAN:
Get him!

08:51.597 --> 08:53.099
(both scream)

08:53.099 --> 08:54.100
What are you
doing here?!

08:54.100 --> 08:56.102
n!
This is for wome

09:00.606 --> 09:03.109
Glad you g
uys showed up.

09:10.616 --> 09:14.120
Handcuff them together
and bring their things.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.128
(woman speaking
over P.A. system in Bulgarian)

09:26.632 --> 09:27.133
MacGYVE
R: Ciao!

09:28.634 --> 09:30.636
I'm sorry.

09:30.636 --> 09:31.637
Mm-hmm.

09:31.637 --> 09:32.638
e?
Are you mad at m

09:32.638 --> 09:34.140
Why would I be mad
at you?

09:34.140 --> 09:36.142
Well, you missed
your plane.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.143
Right.

09:37.643 --> 09:38.644
ge.
And they t
ook your lugga

09:39.145 --> 09:41.147
.
Yeah.
And they think y
ou stole the jewels

09:41.147 --> 09:43.149
Yeah, that's right.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.650
t.
And they hav
e your passpor

09:44.650 --> 09:47.153
I almost forgot that one.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.155
Well, see, then you
should be mad at me.

09:49.655 --> 09:50.656
All right, I'm mad at you.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.659
at.
You really didn't
have to tell me th

09:54.660 --> 09:57.163
You're right. I'm sorry.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.665
.
I had to put
the jewelry
in your pocket

09:59.665 --> 10:02.668
I had no choice.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.670
Well, he g
ave it to me,

10:04.670 --> 10:06.172
and I was just
taking it along,

10:06.172 --> 10:09.675
h.
and besides, it's 
not worth all that muc

10:09.675 --> 10:10.676
How do you know that?

10:10.676 --> 10:12.178
Well, because a guy
with some government job

10:12.178 --> 10:14.680
who's got a shoe box
for an apartment

10:14.680 --> 10:16.182
lry
wouldn't give me real jewe

10:16.182 --> 10:17.683
unless it wasn't
real, right?

10:19.685 --> 10:22.188
If that's true,
why is still holding us

10:22.188 --> 10:23.689
now that he has it back?

10:28.194 --> 10:31.197
Penny Parker,
you're holding something back.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.699
ng.
It was just one ri

10:33.699 --> 10:34.700
How much cou
ld it be worth?

10:34.700 --> 10:36.702
If he'd as
ked me nicely,

10:36.702 --> 10:38.204
I would've given
it back to him,

10:38.204 --> 10:39.705
but he had to go
and show up at the airport

10:39.705 --> 10:41.707
with all those policemen
and make me look

10:41.707 --> 10:44.210
.
like some kind
of criminal or something.
Hold it. Wait a minute

10:44.210 --> 10:46.712
Fine. Why my pocket?

10:47.213 --> 10:50.216
Well, you were
the closest one around.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.717
t.
All righ

10:51.717 --> 10:53.719
?
Why... why hide it

10:53.719 --> 10:56.222
Oh, I knew he'd try
to take them from me.

10:56.222 --> 10:59.725
He always does
when he gets mad at me.

11:01.727 --> 11:02.728
What are you looking for?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.231
I'm looking
for a way out of here.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.233
Well, why?
You didn't do anything.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.235
They'll probably
let you go soon.

11:09.235 --> 11:12.738
Oh, maybe, but I can't afford
to take that chance.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.740
Besides, they've got
something of mine.

11:14.740 --> 11:15.741
I want it back.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.743
So, we're both
in the same fix.

11:18.244 --> 11:19.245
(whirring)

11:19.245 --> 11:20.746
Grab that chair.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.248
Well, why don't
I get two chairs,

11:22.748 --> 11:23.749
and then we can both sit?

11:23.749 --> 11:25.251
ng.
It's not for sitti

11:25.251 --> 11:28.254
ir.
Never mind the cha

11:33.759 --> 11:36.262
Excuse me.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.273
Hey, that's good. Cheap walls.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.775
We'll just poke our way
right out of here.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.789
MacGYVER:
It's a baggage conveyor belt.

12:03.789 --> 12:06.292
But there's no way I can just
poke through this chicken wire.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.797
Damn!

12:11.797 --> 12:13.799
It was a nice
thought, though.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.801
(sighs)

12:22.308 --> 12:23.809
All right, bend these out.

12:23.809 --> 12:27.313
We're going to make 'em
into a figure-eight.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.315
Well, what are y
ou going to do with
a figure eight?

12:29.815 --> 12:31.317
You ever been to a rodeo?

12:31.317 --> 12:32.818
Sort of.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.320
..
I was Queen of the
Future Farmers once.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.822
Later, later.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.830
All right. Good.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.871
o.
PARKER:
Now I know why you
asked about the rode

13:25.871 --> 13:28.374
You're going to lasso
the conveyor belt.

13:28.374 --> 13:31.877
I sure am going to try.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.389
Let's go.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.890
What are you doing?

13:44.890 --> 13:47.893
I've got to have
my purse.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.902
It's just like the ride
at Disneyland.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.905
?
Will you keep
your head down

14:05.911 --> 14:07.913
(many people talking)

14:24.430 --> 14:27.433
Economy class.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.441
.
Well, that was fun

14:35.941 --> 14:36.442
at?
Now wh

14:36.942 --> 14:37.943
Good question.

14:37.943 --> 14:39.445
Darned good question.

14:39.945 --> 14:40.946
xi!
Ta

14:40.946 --> 14:42.948
Correct. I want
both their descriptions sent

14:42.948 --> 14:45.451
to all border posts
and police patrols immediately.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.952
They have escaped custody

14:46.952 --> 14:49.955
and are to be considered enemies
of the state.

15:03.969 --> 15:05.471
(door opens)

15:05.471 --> 15:07.473
.
Ah, Stepan

15:09.475 --> 15:11.977
At ease.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.479
At ease.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.981
Well, uh, if it's
about the girl, Uncle,

15:15.981 --> 15:16.982
I can explain.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.984
er,
Oh, yes, that'
s, uh, Penny Park

15:18.984 --> 15:21.487
r.
the night club dance

15:21.487 --> 15:23.489
me
What is a litt
le interesting to

15:23.489 --> 15:27.493
wn,
is why, after all 
the women you have kno

15:27.493 --> 15:30.496
you were trying 
to prevent this one
from going home.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.498
Well, she's
a very special woman, Uncle,

15:32.498 --> 15:34.500
and I gave her
some of Mother's jewelry,

15:34.500 --> 15:35.501
just to wear.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.505
You did what?

15:40.005 --> 15:42.007
I gave her some of Mother's
jewelry, just to wear.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.509
Mother said you gave it to her

15:43.509 --> 15:45.511
and that it was just paste,
so I figured...

15:45.511 --> 15:50.015
That paste
is worth 700,000leva!

15:50.015 --> 15:51.517
What?

15:51.517 --> 15:54.019
rl
The jewels you
loaned out to th
is bubble-headed gi

15:54.019 --> 15:57.523
are part of the crown jewels
of the German House of Hanover.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.024
Well, how did you get them?

15:59.024 --> 16:00.025
ant
It is unimport

16:00.025 --> 16:01.527
how I got them.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.529
Who has them now?

16:03.529 --> 16:06.031
I do. All but a ring,
but I'll get it back, Uncle.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.032
I promise.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.034
You had better.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.536
y
They are part
of our securit

16:10.536 --> 16:12.037
which is already
in jeopardy.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.039
Oursecurity?

16:14.540 --> 16:16.041
I am confused, Uncle.

16:16.041 --> 16:19.044
I will try
to unconfuse you.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.547
Some documents were stolen
from this office

16:21.547 --> 16:23.048
and then returned.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.050
d
We must assume
the undergroun

16:25.050 --> 16:26.552
has them copie
d on microfilm.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.554
The documents reveal the numbers

16:28.554 --> 16:29.555
of the Swiss bank accounts

16:30.055 --> 16:32.558
of some of us
in this department.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.560
ng
This job pay
s almost nothi

16:34.560 --> 16:35.561
and demands our blood.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.062
Just to live, it is necessary

16:37.563 --> 16:39.064
to skim a little here and there.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.567
And the jewelry
is part of the skimming.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.068
A small part, yes.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.069
A small part?

16:44.069 --> 16:47.072
700,000leva!

16:47.573 --> 16:50.075
I can see where that
could be embarrassing.

16:50.075 --> 16:53.078
It could be fatal...
for both of us.

16:53.579 --> 16:54.580
But I have done nothing.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.081
I'm innocent.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.083
Perhaps...

16:58.083 --> 17:00.586
but unfortunately,
your name appears

17:01.086 --> 17:04.089
on one of those
Swiss bank accounts--

17:04.089 --> 17:07.593
number 1-7-7-9,
to be precise.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.094
They'll send us
to Siberia.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.096
Not if we reco
ver the microfilm

17:11.597 --> 17:13.598
which is the only
evidence against us.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.602
You have been monitoring the
underground, have you not?

17:16.602 --> 17:18.604
Yes. We identified

17:18.604 --> 17:20.606
a man named Burak.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.107
He may be a contact man.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.109
He spends his days
playing chess in the park.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.613
I let him run, hoping
he'd lead us to the others.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.114
Pull him in.

17:29.114 --> 17:32.117
Persuade him to tell
us what he knows.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.619
What if he won't talk?

17:33.619 --> 17:36.121
He must talk, Stepan.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.123
If he does not,
you can forget about Siberia.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.626
It's going to be a cigarette
and a blindfold

17:41.126 --> 17:43.128
in the courtyard downstairs.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.631
He must be made to talk.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.134
You don't mean torture?

17:49.134 --> 17:53.138
I mean whateve
r is necessary.

18:06.151 --> 18:10.155
You know, I never coul
d learn to play chess.

18:20.666 --> 18:23.168
Psst!

18:23.168 --> 18:25.170
Psst!

18:27.673 --> 18:29.675
Come.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.682
You are supposed to be
out of the country.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.184
What happened?
Oh, who is she?

18:39.184 --> 18:40.686
She's a very close friend.

18:40.686 --> 18:41.687
Hi, I'm Penny...

18:41.687 --> 18:43.188
The militia
are hunting you.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.190
Yeah, could I borrow
one of your earrings?

18:45.190 --> 18:47.192
Sure.

18:47.192 --> 18:48.193
Now-now, we...
Hey!

18:48.193 --> 18:49.695
I'll get you
another one.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.698
Where is the microfilm?

18:53.198 --> 18:54.700
Safe.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.701
And where is safe?

18:55.701 --> 18:57.202
It's with a friend
of hers.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.205
Fortunately, he doesn't know
what he has.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.207
This friend--
does he have a name?

19:02.708 --> 19:04.209
v.
Stepan. Stepan Frolo

19:06.211 --> 19:09.214
Major Stepan Frolov,
State Security?

19:09.214 --> 19:11.216
Nephew of General Petrovich?

19:11.216 --> 19:13.719
im.
Yeah, that's h

19:13.719 --> 19:17.723
You said some guy
with a government job.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.728
(sighs):
Figures.

19:24.229 --> 19:27.232
PARKER:
Can I keep these
for a souvenir?

19:27.733 --> 19:29.234
Why does Frolov
want her?

19:29.234 --> 19:31.236
He gave her some
kind of jewelry,

19:31.236 --> 19:32.738
k.
and now he
wants it bac

19:32.738 --> 19:34.740
This jewelry--
can I see it please?

19:43.248 --> 19:46.251
Frolov will do anything
to get this back.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.754
Oh, come on,
it can't be worth that much.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.255
It's worth a fortune.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.757
It is part of the treasure

19:51.757 --> 19:53.258
that his uncle looted
from the state.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.260
at?
How do you know th

19:55.260 --> 19:58.263
It was evidence
in the documents we got

19:58.263 --> 19:59.765
from his office safe.

19:59.765 --> 20:03.268
You mean Stepan gave me jewelry
his uncle stole?

20:03.268 --> 20:05.270
?
And Uncle wants it
kept secret, right

20:05.771 --> 20:07.773
That and many other secrets.

20:07.773 --> 20:11.276
It is all on the microfilm
we placed in your hands today.

20:11.276 --> 20:13.278
Holy cow!

20:14.780 --> 20:17.282
Can you hide her
till I get it back?

20:17.282 --> 20:19.284
You are a spy!

20:19.785 --> 20:21.787
Just a couple of hours.
That's all I need.

20:21.787 --> 20:25.791
I do know a place. Follow me.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.794
Are you really a spy?

20:28.794 --> 20:31.296
.
I'm just doing a
favor for a friend

20:31.797 --> 20:34.800
Now, follow me,
but stay behind.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.312
There they are!

20:47.312 --> 20:49.314
Go! Go!

20:49.815 --> 20:51.817
Get them!

20:51.817 --> 20:53.318
Stop them!

20:53.318 --> 20:55.320
(whistles blowing)

21:09.835 --> 21:12.337
There, on the carousel!

21:12.337 --> 21:13.839
It's hopeless.
They've got us.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.841
Not yet, they don't.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.342
g,
To get the brass rin

21:17.342 --> 21:20.345
.
they've got to get
 on the merry-go-round

21:22.347 --> 21:24.349
(carousel music playing)

21:33.358 --> 21:34.860
Halt!

21:35.360 --> 21:37.362
(shouting in Bulgarian)

21:37.362 --> 21:40.365
(carousel music speeding up)

22:04.389 --> 22:05.891
(music stops)
(screaming)

22:05.891 --> 22:07.392
(grunting)

22:32.417 --> 22:34.920
ng?
Why aren't we hidi

22:35.420 --> 22:36.922
We are.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.924
nk
Oh, you mean lik
e nobody would thi

22:38.924 --> 22:40.926
?
of looking for us
right here in the open

22:40.926 --> 22:42.928
That's the idea.

22:42.928 --> 22:46.431
.
Oh. Okay, that's i
t-- Stepan's apartment

22:46.431 --> 22:48.433
He only has
three rooms.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.935
I dated a region
al supervisor once.

22:49.935 --> 22:51.937
t
You could've
put Stepan's
whole apartmen

22:51.937 --> 22:52.938
,
in his living room

22:52.938 --> 22:54.439
.
but it was
really too big

22:54.439 --> 22:57.442
.
Stepan's is kind
of, you know, cozy

22:57.442 --> 22:58.944
He had all these
great records.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.947
Wait a minute.
What about security?

23:01.947 --> 23:05.450
Oh. Well, only governm
ent officials live there.

23:05.450 --> 23:08.453
d.
I've seen two or three
militiamen walking aroun

23:08.453 --> 23:10.455
Oh, and there'
s a guardhouse
on the corner.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.457
Wonderful.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.459
All right.

23:14.459 --> 23:16.962
I want you to stay here
until I come back, okay?

23:16.962 --> 23:18.463
Well, why 
his apartment?

23:18.463 --> 23:20.465
e.
I mean, maybe our
stuff's at his offic

23:20.465 --> 23:22.467
Penny, think about it.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.469
Those jewels could put him
into a work farm

23:24.469 --> 23:25.470
for the rest of his life.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.973
Now, I'm not sure,
but chances are

23:27.973 --> 23:29.975
he'd want to keep them
away from Headquarters.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.977
At least that's
what I'm counting on.

23:31.977 --> 23:35.981
.
Wow. I bet old General
Petrovich is petrified

23:35.981 --> 23:37.983
Yeah.

23:39.985 --> 23:41.987
.
Um, MacGyver..

23:41.987 --> 23:43.989
?
you are coming bac
k for me, aren't you

23:43.989 --> 23:45.490
ng
I mean, you'
re not just goi

23:45.490 --> 23:46.992
e?
to get your stuf
f and bug out on m

23:46.992 --> 23:49.494
No, I wouldn't do that.

23:49.494 --> 23:51.496
I didn't really
think you would.

23:51.496 --> 23:54.499
I just have this hab
it of trusting people.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.002
ke.
Well, sometimes, I
think it's a mista

23:57.002 --> 24:03.008
Penny... you say what you think
and you do what you say.

24:03.508 --> 24:06.011
That's not such a bad policy
in my book.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.013
Maybe.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.515
Sometimes, you can get hurt.

24:10.515 --> 24:14.519
Well, no one became a great
woman living in a vacuum.

24:14.519 --> 24:17.522
Am I a great woman?

24:17.522 --> 24:22.027
You got all the makings.

24:22.027 --> 24:25.030
That's the nicest thing
anybody ever said to me.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.532
Well, you're the nicest
person I've ever said it to.

24:33.538 --> 24:36.041
That's for good luck.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.051
We need all the
luck we can get.

25:00.565 --> 25:02.567
(gasping)

25:06.071 --> 25:10.075
You are wasting my time with
this stupid attitude of yours.

25:10.075 --> 25:12.077
I want answers.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.583
Your name is Anton Burak.
A widower, no children.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.085
But you do have
a sister, Marta,

25:20.085 --> 25:22.087
with a husband
and three children.

25:22.087 --> 25:26.091
They are safe in a place
where even you cannot find them.

25:26.091 --> 25:29.094
So, do what you will.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.596
I will tell you nothing.

25:31.596 --> 25:33.098
They are living
in the mountains

25:33.098 --> 25:37.102
.
at the home
of a shepherd
named Patinoff

25:37.102 --> 25:40.105
,
This is a pict
ure of your sister

25:40.605 --> 25:42.107
and, of course
, the children.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.609
.
These were taken yesterday

25:44.609 --> 25:46.111
d,
The nine-year-ol

25:46.111 --> 25:49.114
er.
he looks like he i
s a good soccer play

25:49.114 --> 25:51.616
.
Maybe not with broken legs

25:52.117 --> 25:53.618
.
And here..

25:53.618 --> 25:56.121
Stop.

25:57.622 --> 26:03.128
The man came to me
with the password.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.632
Then he came back
with the girl.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.135
Name? Description?

26:10.135 --> 26:13.638
American.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.640
Very pretty.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.144
He called her "Penny."

26:21.146 --> 26:24.149
I, I don't know
her family name.

26:26.651 --> 26:31.156
.
I... I don't k
now the man's name

26:32.657 --> 26:37.662
It is not important, Mr. Burak,

26:37.662 --> 26:42.167
because I think my nephew does.

26:42.167 --> 26:45.670
or?
Is that right, Maj

26:45.670 --> 26:48.173
His name is MacGyver.

26:48.173 --> 26:51.676
n.
So, she has been
using you, Stepa

26:51.676 --> 26:53.178
t.
She must be
an American agen

26:53.178 --> 26:55.180
I cannot believe this.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.682
er.
The microfilm must be amon
g the things you took from h

26:57.682 --> 26:58.683
?
Where are they

26:58.683 --> 26:59.684
In my apartment.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.686
w!
Well, get it! No

27:02.187 --> 27:03.688
And, Stepan,

27:03.688 --> 27:05.190
run
if you sho
uld happen to

27:05.190 --> 27:08.193
.
into this MacGyver again..

27:08.193 --> 27:10.695
m.
shoot hi

27:10.695 --> 27:12.697
Yes, Uncle.

27:31.549 --> 27:34.052
MacGYVER:
Bouncin' around Bulgaria
with Penny Parker

27:34.052 --> 27:36.054
reminded me
of playin' dominoes.

27:36.554 --> 27:39.557
With every move,
something else might fall.

27:42.060 --> 27:45.563
But the thing is
it all started so simply.

27:45.563 --> 27:49.067
In for the chess game,
out with the information.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.069
And now here I am
scaling the wall

27:51.569 --> 27:53.071
of a heavily guarded
government building,

27:53.071 --> 27:55.073
and breaking
into the apartment

27:55.073 --> 27:57.075
of a major
in the secret police.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.577
Simple, right?

27:59.577 --> 28:03.581
I'll tell ya
what's simple: me.

28:03.581 --> 28:06.084
For gettin' into that first
conversation with Penny Parker.

28:14.592 --> 28:16.594
But what else could I do?

28:16.594 --> 28:21.099
I mean, a guy
just can't be rude.

28:21.599 --> 28:25.603
I mean, how was I to know...
how was I to know?

28:50.628 --> 28:52.130
My postcard.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.631
I think my luck's
starting to change.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.135
(door buzzes)

28:57.135 --> 28:59.137
(knocking)

29:05.643 --> 29:07.145
PARKER:
MacGyver?

29:07.145 --> 29:11.149
Hey, are you in there?
It's okay. It's me, Penny.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.651
Let me in.

29:13.651 --> 29:15.653
(knocking)

29:17.155 --> 29:18.656
What are you doing here?

29:18.656 --> 29:20.158
Well, I'm sorry,
but the place kept...

29:20.658 --> 29:21.659
Shh!

29:21.659 --> 29:23.161
...filling up with the soldiers,

29:23.161 --> 29:25.163
and they were comin'
over to my table
and buyin' me drinks.

29:25.163 --> 29:26.664
So I came here.

29:27.165 --> 29:28.666
How did you get
out of the place?

29:28.666 --> 29:30.168
Well, I went
to the ladies' room

29:30.668 --> 29:31.669
and climbed out the window.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.173
d.
Of course you di

29:35.673 --> 29:38.676
ns?
Why do I ask those questio

29:38.676 --> 29:41.179
Well, I figured
I'd better come over here

29:41.179 --> 29:42.680
or how else would you find me?

29:43.181 --> 29:44.682
And you know what else?

29:44.682 --> 29:46.684
Right next to the place
was this cute little shop

29:46.684 --> 29:48.686
that had the cutest
little dress in the window.

29:48.686 --> 29:49.687
Wait a minute!

29:49.687 --> 29:50.188
Shh.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.693
How'd you get
into the building?

29:55.693 --> 29:58.696
s.
Well, I came in the
front door downstair

29:58.696 --> 29:59.697
me.
The doorman knows

30:00.198 --> 30:03.201
Oh, and you ha
d to sneak in

30:03.201 --> 30:04.702
.
so nobody would
know you were here

30:04.702 --> 30:05.703
.
And now I've..

30:05.703 --> 30:09.707
It's okay.
It's all right.

30:09.707 --> 30:11.209
Wow!

30:12.210 --> 30:14.212
r?
Well, did you find
what you were looking fo

30:14.212 --> 30:15.713
Yes, I found what
I'm looking for.

30:15.713 --> 30:17.215
Everything but the passports.

30:17.215 --> 30:19.717
Now let's get out of here
before your friend comes home.

30:19.717 --> 30:21.219
Oh, he never gets
home till real late.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.221
Good.

30:23.721 --> 30:25.223
(footsteps approach)

30:25.223 --> 30:26.224
Usually.

30:26.224 --> 30:29.227
Right.

30:29.227 --> 30:30.228
(keys jangle in door)

30:30.228 --> 30:31.229
Come on.

30:43.741 --> 30:47.245
ou.
I was hoping
we wouldn't find y

30:47.245 --> 30:51.749
.
I could be shot fo
r even thinking this

30:54.252 --> 30:57.255
MacGYVER:
And I could be shot
for just being here.

30:57.255 --> 31:02.260
So, it's time
to start finding a way out.

31:15.773 --> 31:19.277
nd
Now... shall we talk
about your American frie

31:19.277 --> 31:21.279
and the whereabout
s of my ring?

31:21.779 --> 31:25.783
Yeah. It wasn't even yours.
Stolen.

31:25.783 --> 31:28.786
Involved in a whole bunch
of really illegal stuff!

31:28.786 --> 31:33.291
Oh, Penny, how did
we get ourselves into all this?

31:34.792 --> 31:39.297
MacGYVER:
My sentiments exactly.

31:39.297 --> 31:42.300
Kitchen chemistry has got
to be the way to go here.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.802
PARKER:
See? There you go again.
You and all your...

31:44.802 --> 31:48.806
MacGYVER:
My recipe calls
for a deep cooking pot,

31:50.308 --> 31:52.810
a dash of pest control,

31:52.810 --> 31:56.314
four measured cups
of soap flakes,

31:59.317 --> 32:03.321
all garnished with tile cleaner
and left to steep.

32:05.323 --> 32:06.824
,
PARKER:
If you don't watch out

32:06.824 --> 32:09.327
you're gonna be just
like your uncle.

32:09.827 --> 32:11.329
ugh
FROLOV:
My uncle was smart eno

32:11.829 --> 32:13.331
.
to figure out
that you are a spy

32:13.331 --> 32:16.334
I mean, it was
all perfectly simple.

32:16.334 --> 32:20.838
Well, suddenly
spying and stealing

32:20.838 --> 32:22.340
and jewelry
and, uh...

32:22.340 --> 32:23.841
I wasn't spying.

32:23.841 --> 32:25.343
What do you call it?

32:25.343 --> 32:30.348
Now what I need
is a time delay fuse.

32:30.348 --> 32:36.354
A healthy ladle of lard
will do for starters.

32:36.354 --> 32:39.857
Covered with a single
layer of newspaper.

32:46.364 --> 32:49.867
Sprinkled with crystal
of oven cleaner.

32:51.869 --> 32:53.871
And all left to marinate

32:53.871 --> 32:57.375
under a soft flow
of natural gas.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.876
So I do want the ring back

32:58.876 --> 33:00.878
and I also want
your accomplice, Mr. MacGyver.

33:00.878 --> 33:02.380
.
He's not my accomplice

33:02.880 --> 33:03.881
There's no use to lie, Penny.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.383
I know about him.
You used me.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.385
The two of you were
working together as spies.

33:07.885 --> 33:09.387
y!
I'm not a sp

33:09.387 --> 33:11.889
We met for the first
time at the airport.

33:11.889 --> 33:12.890
I was just standing in line.

33:12.890 --> 33:14.892
If that is true, he has
nothing to fear from us

33:14.892 --> 33:15.893
and neither do you.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.395
You can speak out freely.
Where is he?

33:17.395 --> 33:18.896
Right here.

33:23.901 --> 33:26.904
Mr. MacGyver, I commend you.

33:26.904 --> 33:28.906
May I take this
as a surrender?

33:28.906 --> 33:32.910
Uh... not just yet.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.912
Look outside the window.

33:48.426 --> 33:49.427
Give up?

33:49.927 --> 33:50.928
Sort of.

33:50.928 --> 33:52.930
d.
The building
is surrounde

33:52.930 --> 33:56.434
Well, I certai
nly would hope so,

33:56.434 --> 33:57.935
b.
or you wouldn't
be doin' your jo

33:57.935 --> 34:00.938
Then you must also know
that there is no escape for you.

34:00.938 --> 34:02.440
It's over.

34:04.942 --> 34:07.445
The information
that was passed on to you...

34:07.445 --> 34:08.946
I take that now, please.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.951
so.
No, I don't think

34:14.452 --> 34:16.454
I'm not a man who likes
violence, Mr. MacGyver.

34:16.454 --> 34:19.456
I.
That's gre
at. Neither do

34:19.456 --> 34:20.958
Move away, Penny.

34:20.958 --> 34:22.960
What are you gonna do?

34:23.460 --> 34:24.962
Well, the clich? thi
ng to be done here is

34:25.463 --> 34:26.964
for him to blow
my kneecaps off.

34:27.465 --> 34:28.966
If necessary.

34:28.966 --> 34:31.469
Are you both crazy?

34:31.469 --> 34:37.975
(bubbling)

34:37.975 --> 34:39.976
Come on, Frolov,
let her go.

34:39.976 --> 34:41.478
.
She told you the truth

34:41.978 --> 34:44.482
e,
And capturing me,
an enemy of the stat

34:44.482 --> 34:45.983
oughta be enough, right?

34:48.485 --> 34:50.487
?
FROLOV:
What have you done

34:52.489 --> 34:53.991
Burnt the roast!

34:53.991 --> 34:55.993
(coughing)

34:55.993 --> 34:56.994
Oh!

34:56.994 --> 34:58.496
Sorry.

34:58.496 --> 35:00.498
Penny, grab a bathrobe.

35:00.498 --> 35:01.499
We'll mingle with the tenants.

35:08.005 --> 35:09.006
(police shouting)

35:12.009 --> 35:13.511
(fire alarm sounds)

35:18.015 --> 35:19.016
MacGYVER:
A bathrobe.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.519
I thought I said a bathrobe.

35:21.519 --> 35:24.021
This is the nicest one I have.

35:24.021 --> 35:26.023
There's Stepan's car.

35:32.530 --> 35:33.531
.
I'm gonna have
to hot-wire it

35:34.031 --> 35:35.533
Maybe not.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.035
It was on the dresser.

35:40.037 --> 35:41.038
Amazing!

35:53.551 --> 35:54.552
They will certainl
y try to make it

35:55.052 --> 35:56.053
to the Greek border.

35:56.053 --> 35:57.555
I have alerted
our border stations.

35:57.555 --> 35:59.557
They have a full description
of both fugitives.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.559
And your car, sir.

36:01.559 --> 36:05.062
h.
Good, but 
not good enoug

36:05.062 --> 36:07.064
,
Now, with the
gasoline they have

36:07.064 --> 36:10.067
.
they should run out
somewhere in that area

36:10.067 --> 36:12.069
ned
Now, I want men statio

36:12.069 --> 36:14.071
out of sight at ev
ery gasoline station

36:14.071 --> 36:15.573
.
in that circle

36:15.573 --> 36:17.575
ct
Then, I want our people
to search every farm tra

36:18.075 --> 36:20.077
e,
from here to her

36:20.077 --> 36:21.579
especially the turnoff
s to the main highway.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.080
?
Understood

36:23.080 --> 36:24.081
Yes, sir.

36:24.582 --> 36:26.083
There is no way
they can get through now, sir.

36:26.083 --> 36:27.585
y.
There is always a wa

36:27.585 --> 36:29.086
n
We just have
to make certai

36:29.086 --> 36:31.088
.
they won't find it

36:32.590 --> 36:34.091
(birds singing)

36:34.091 --> 36:37.595
PARKER:
You know,
it's so beautiful up here.

36:37.595 --> 36:39.096
So peaceful.

36:39.096 --> 36:42.600
?
Yeah, just like in
a storybook, right

36:42.600 --> 36:44.101
You know, I really like you.

36:44.101 --> 36:45.603
You understand me.

36:45.603 --> 36:48.105
We're on the same wavelength.

36:48.105 --> 36:50.107
e.
Well, that worries m

36:51.609 --> 36:54.111
me
It also worries

36:54.111 --> 36:56.113
nk.
that we're running
on an empty gas ta

36:56.113 --> 36:58.616
Well, why don't we just
get some more?

36:58.616 --> 37:00.117
.
Oh, sure, sure

37:00.117 --> 37:02.620
We can just drive righ
t on into a gas station

37:02.620 --> 37:04.121
ht
in the mid
dle of the nig

37:04.121 --> 37:06.123
r.
and ask 'em to
fill up a KGB ca

37:06.123 --> 37:07.625
Mm-hmm.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.127
Hey, I know
where we might get some.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.630
rs.
I'm all ea

37:15.633 --> 37:18.636
FROLOV:
Car Two, have you reached
the western sector yet?

37:18.636 --> 37:20.638
MAN:
We are almost
at the checkpoint, sir.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.139
Good. Make sure
you have enough men.

37:22.139 --> 37:23.641
I don't want them
to slip through.

37:23.641 --> 37:24.642
I'm heading east.

37:24.642 --> 37:26.143
I have an idea
I want to check out.

37:28.145 --> 37:30.147
(birds singing)

37:33.150 --> 37:35.152
Penny...

37:35.152 --> 37:37.655
.
there's no g
as can in there

37:38.155 --> 37:40.658
Well, gee, that's where it was
the last time.

37:40.658 --> 37:42.660
Nice duds.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.162
It's all I could find.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.168
Uh, Miss Parker,

37:51.168 --> 37:53.671
whose place
is this, anyway?

37:53.671 --> 37:55.172
Stepan's uncle.

37:55.172 --> 37:57.675
Stepan used to bring me
here on weekends.

37:58.175 --> 38:00.177
We'd ride motorcycles
in the hills, and...

38:00.177 --> 38:01.679
Wait a minute!

38:01.679 --> 38:02.680
I remember now!

38:03.180 --> 38:04.181
About the gas.

38:04.181 --> 38:05.683
The can was almost empty,

38:05.683 --> 38:07.685
so Stepan took it down
to get it...

38:09.186 --> 38:12.189
...refilled.

38:12.189 --> 38:13.691
I'm sorry.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.694
No problem, no problem.

38:16.694 --> 38:18.696
Everyone forgets
something

38:18.696 --> 38:21.198
once in a while.

38:21.198 --> 38:23.701
You're sweet, but I...

38:25.703 --> 38:27.204
Wait a minute!

38:28.706 --> 38:31.709
There's that machine, uh,
that they used to plow with.

38:32.209 --> 38:34.211
A tractor?

38:34.712 --> 38:35.713
Yeah!

38:35.713 --> 38:38.215
They keep it in the shed
on the other side of the hill.

38:38.215 --> 38:40.217
Don't tractors run on gas?

38:40.217 --> 38:41.719
(sighs)

38:41.719 --> 38:42.720
They've been known to.

38:43.220 --> 38:45.723
Uh, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny,

38:45.723 --> 38:47.224
whoa, whoa, wh
oa, whoa, whoa!

38:47.725 --> 38:48.726
c.
Look, you're terrifi

38:49.226 --> 38:51.729
.
I mean, you'
re really great

38:51.729 --> 38:53.230
But I'll go,
all right?

38:53.731 --> 38:54.732
But, MacGyver!

38:54.732 --> 38:55.733
st.
No, no, no
, no, I insi

38:55.733 --> 38:57.735
..
It's my duty as.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.236
Oh, swell!

38:59.236 --> 39:01.238
You're not gonna
shoot us, are you?

39:01.238 --> 39:02.239
Shoot you? Why?

39:02.239 --> 39:05.242
For stealing my car?
Destroying my career?

39:05.242 --> 39:08.245
Collaborating with a spy?
Stealing state secrets?

39:08.245 --> 39:10.748
Oh, come on, Stepan!

39:10.748 --> 39:14.251
s.
You and I both know
this has nothing to
do with state secret

39:14.251 --> 39:15.753
We will not discuss
the nature

39:15.753 --> 39:17.254
of the things missing.

39:17.254 --> 39:20.257
The main thing is,
I've found you.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.760
Yeah, by the way,
howdidyou find us?

39:22.760 --> 39:25.763
I estimated how far the gas
in my car would take you.

39:25.763 --> 39:27.765
And this place
was within range.

39:27.765 --> 39:30.768
I took a chance that
Penny would remember it.

39:30.768 --> 39:33.270
I did.

39:33.270 --> 39:35.773
Stepan, we had a nice time.

39:35.773 --> 39:37.274
And I don't think very much

39:37.775 --> 39:40.277
of the way you're using it
against me!

39:40.277 --> 39:41.779
For the first time
in my life,

39:41.779 --> 39:44.281
I am thinking
like a professional.

39:44.782 --> 39:47.785
By what, defendi
ng corruption in
your government?

39:47.785 --> 39:48.786
Nice.

39:49.286 --> 39:50.788
I have no choice.

39:50.788 --> 39:52.790
e.
I don't think
that's quite tru

39:52.790 --> 39:55.292
e.
It's a matter of
conscience, Stev

39:55.793 --> 39:57.795
?
You do have one 
of those, don't you

39:57.795 --> 40:01.298
I thought he did. Once.

40:01.298 --> 40:03.801
And here's the ring
you wanted so badly!

40:04.301 --> 40:06.804
And whatever you think,
I'm not a spy.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.806
I wouldn't even know
how to do it.

40:08.806 --> 40:10.808
Penny!

40:12.309 --> 40:15.813
Believe me, all I ever wanted
was to keep you with me.

40:15.813 --> 40:18.315
Well, then why don't you
let her go, Steve?

40:18.315 --> 40:20.317
In fact,
why don't you let us both go?

40:20.317 --> 40:21.318
Are you crazy?

40:21.318 --> 40:22.820
It's been rumored.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.322
I must ask you
to give me the microfilm.

40:25.322 --> 40:28.325
I would do as he asks.

40:45.843 --> 40:47.845
an.
PETROVICH:
You have d
one well, Step

40:50.347 --> 40:54.351
Much better than
I had thought.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.353
.
Now finish the job

40:56.353 --> 40:57.354
Sir?

40:57.354 --> 40:58.355
Kill them.

40:58.856 --> 40:59.857
FROLOV:
What?

40:59.857 --> 41:02.359
But why?

41:02.359 --> 41:04.862
Because I am compromised
as long as they live.

41:04.862 --> 41:06.864
an,
MacGYVER:
You know, Step

41:06.864 --> 41:09.366
I think you're a part
of that compromise.

41:09.366 --> 41:10.868
r.
No good, Mr. MacGyve

41:10.868 --> 41:15.372
Stepan has only
to gain by my favo
r and my position.

41:15.372 --> 41:17.374
me.
He poses n
o threat to

41:17.374 --> 41:19.376
.
But, Penny, she's done nothing

41:19.376 --> 41:20.377
I believe that now.

41:20.377 --> 41:21.879
,
It is not wh
at she has done

41:21.879 --> 41:23.380
n.
it is what s
he knows, Stepa

41:23.881 --> 41:27.384
Success always has its price.

41:27.384 --> 41:29.887
FROLOV:
I want no witnesses, Uncle.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.890
Where are your men?

41:32.890 --> 41:34.391
Good.

41:34.892 --> 41:38.896
Already beginning to
think like a bureaucrat.

41:38.896 --> 41:41.398
They're at the crossroads.

41:41.398 --> 41:44.401
.
They have orders t
o wait there for ten
minutes, then come

41:44.902 --> 41:46.403
At which time,
 we will tell them

41:46.403 --> 41:48.405
it was necessary t
o shoot these spies,

41:48.405 --> 41:49.907
who tried to escape.

41:49.907 --> 41:51.408
Smart. That's real smart.

41:51.408 --> 41:52.910
FROLOV:
Yes, he is.

41:52.910 --> 41:55.913
He's always been
real smart.

41:59.917 --> 42:01.418
Stepan!

42:01.418 --> 42:03.420
ve!
MacGYVER:
Nice shot, Ste

42:05.923 --> 42:07.424
PARKER:
Oh, Stepan,

42:07.424 --> 42:08.425
you're wonderful!

42:08.425 --> 42:09.426
MacGYVER:
Uh, kids,

42:09.927 --> 42:10.928
hate to break this up,

42:10.928 --> 42:13.430
but we do still have
to get past the general's men.

42:13.430 --> 42:14.932
Let's take the
general's car.

42:14.932 --> 42:16.433
All right.

42:16.433 --> 42:17.935
e.
I grew up no
t far from her

42:17.935 --> 42:20.437
There is a small r
oad that leads around
the main highway.

42:20.437 --> 42:21.939
us.
They'll never see

42:21.939 --> 42:23.941
You're really
coming with us?

42:23.941 --> 42:25.442
Actually I can even
pay our way.

42:25.442 --> 42:28.445
I have Swiss bank account
number 1-7-7-9.

42:28.445 --> 42:31.448
MacGYVER:
Let's hope you live long enough
to spend it.

42:59.476 --> 43:02.479
They escaped in my car.
Did you see that?

43:02.479 --> 43:06.483
They can only be heading
for the border. Quickly!

43:06.483 --> 43:08.986
(man speaking Bulgarian)

43:16.994 --> 43:18.996
(tires squealing)

43:36.013 --> 43:39.016
y.
We've got compan

43:41.518 --> 43:45.022
You think this thing can
outrun that command car?

43:45.022 --> 43:47.024
I don't think so.

43:47.024 --> 43:49.026
I was afraid of that.

43:49.026 --> 43:52.029
(tires squealing)

43:55.032 --> 43:58.535
Penny... I want you
to take this wheel.

43:58.535 --> 44:01.038
Drop it in behind
that truck up there.

44:01.038 --> 44:03.040
You ready?

44:03.040 --> 44:06.043
Wow! It's like
a real spy thing, isn't it?

44:07.544 --> 44:09.546
What're you gonna do?

44:09.546 --> 44:11.548
Just get as close to that truck
as you can.

44:11.548 --> 44:14.051
PARKER:
All right!

44:21.558 --> 44:23.560
PARKER:
Gosh, this is just like
the movies!

44:23.560 --> 44:28.065
MacGYVER:
Now, the only way I saw
to keep us ahead of this game

44:28.065 --> 44:30.567
was to work up some kind
of highway hazard.

44:30.567 --> 44:33.570
That's where the hose comes in.

44:33.570 --> 44:35.572
You see, diesel exhaust

44:35.572 --> 44:37.074
is loaded with hydrocarbons.

44:37.074 --> 44:39.076
Now, if you mix hydrocarbons
with water,

44:39.076 --> 44:43.080
you get what scientists call
immiscible liquid.

44:43.080 --> 44:47.084
Immiscible-- that means
water and oil don't mix.

45:02.599 --> 45:05.102
Go faster!

45:08.105 --> 45:10.107
All right, come on!

45:10.607 --> 45:12.109
We're coming, MacGyver!

45:12.109 --> 45:15.112
Now, this hydrocarbon
and water thing I've explained

45:15.112 --> 45:17.114
is a fact,
but in order to get it

45:17.114 --> 45:20.117
to work right,
I needed enough diesel oil

45:20.117 --> 45:23.120
floating on top of enough water
to penetrate.

45:26.623 --> 45:28.125
'Course, one never knows
unless one tries.

45:41.638 --> 45:43.140
PARKER:
Just look at
us, will ya?

45:43.140 --> 45:44.141
Aren'twesomething?

45:44.141 --> 45:46.143
(groaning)

45:49.646 --> 45:52.149
(men shouting in Bulgarian)

45:58.155 --> 45:59.156
You did great!

45:59.156 --> 46:01.158
I can't believ
e I did it!

46:04.661 --> 46:08.165
(men speaking Bulgarian)

46:08.165 --> 46:12.669
MacGYVER:
Okay, under this fence,
we should be in Greece.

46:20.177 --> 46:21.678
All right, let's go.

46:31.688 --> 46:34.191
(shouts)

46:40.697 --> 46:42.699
Howdy.

46:42.699 --> 46:44.201
Do you wish to enter Greece?

46:44.701 --> 46:48.205
e.
I was kind of hoping
we were already ther

46:48.205 --> 46:50.207
Passports, please.

46:50.207 --> 46:53.210
You know, somehow I knew
you were gonna ask that.

46:53.210 --> 46:54.711
Constantine!

46:54.711 --> 46:57.214
u?
Is it yo

46:58.215 --> 47:00.717
Penny...

47:00.717 --> 47:02.219
Penny Parker?

47:02.219 --> 47:03.720
Hi!
(laughs)

47:03.720 --> 47:05.722
Penny Parker!

47:07.724 --> 47:10.227
Every time she smiles.

47:10.227 --> 47:12.229
(laughs)

47:12.229 --> 47:14.231
We should've known.
