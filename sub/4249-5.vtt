09:57.972 --> 09:58.514
- OH, NO, YEAH,
NO, I DID.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.516
- IT'S OKAY.

10:00.599 --> 10:01.767
I DIDN'T EITHER.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.106
I WAS HAVING THIS DEBATE
WITH AMBER

10:07.189 --> 10:08.274
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE

10:08.357 --> 10:09.650
FOR GUYS AND GIRLS
TO BE FRIENDS.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.985
- OH, YEAH?

10:11.068 --> 10:13.738
- AND I TOLD HER THAT
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

10:13.821 --> 10:14.822
- OH.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.033
- AND THAT'S SO IMPORTANT
TO ME.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.200
I'D DO ANYTHING
TO PROTECT THAT.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.746
- YEAH, NO, RIGHT.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.540
- [chuckles]

10:24.623 --> 10:27.501
THIS BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND THING
IS KIND OF COMPLICATED.

10:27.585 --> 10:31.714
- SO WE WERE BETTER OFF BEFORE.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.506
- BEFORE?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.217
- WHEN WE WERE JUST, UH...

10:35.301 --> 10:37.011
- FRIENDS?

10:37.094 --> 10:40.348
- YEAH.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.390
- WHY?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.101
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

10:44.185 --> 10:45.561
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME?

10:45.644 --> 10:46.937
- LOOK, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M HOPELESS.

10:47.021 --> 10:47.730
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
WE'RE JUST--

10:47.813 --> 10:48.439
- WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.108
I KNOW.
I GET THAT NOW.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.485
I WAS WRONG.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.028
BACK TO THE BUDDY BENCH.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.113
- WHAT?

10:56.197 --> 10:57.823
- FRIENDS IT IS.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.829
- RIGHT.

11:03.913 --> 11:04.455
- WHO'S DOWN THERE?

11:04.538 --> 11:06.957
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:13.130 --> 11:15.716
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING
OVER THERE?

11:15.800 --> 11:19.011
MOVE AWAY FROM THAT ALCOVE.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.013
MOVE, I SAY.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.101
- HOW DID YOU TWO GET DOWN HERE?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.602
- VICTOR, VICTOR.

11:26.685 --> 11:27.228
THERE'S A WEASEL
IN THE HEATING VENT.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.230
- THERE'S WHAT?

11:29.313 --> 11:32.858
- HURRY!
IT'S AN EMERGENCY!

11:38.614 --> 11:39.657
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.159
- YEAH, LET'S GO.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.619
- WASTING MY TIME.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.496
- I DEFINITELY SMELLED
BURNT WEASEL.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.497
- AH-AH-AH.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.582
NOT SO FAST.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.668
COME.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.966
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE CELLAR?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.926
- JUST...

11:59.009 --> 12:00.803
REMEMBERING THE FUN TIMES
WE HAD DOWN THERE LAST YEAR.

12:00.886 --> 12:06.183
- QUITE THE COMEDIENNE,
AREN'T YOU, MS. MARTIN?

12:08.060 --> 12:12.982
I WANT TO SEE MY FACE
REFLECTED IN THOSE TOILET BOWLS.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.966
HMM.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.263
- RIGHT, EVERYONE,
TODAY'S THE BIG BID.

12:44.346 --> 12:44.972
FABIAN, FILM FINISHED?

12:45.055 --> 12:46.557
MARA, SPEECH LEARNED?

12:46.640 --> 12:48.142
- YEAH, YEAH.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.185

12:49.268 --> 12:50.561
OH, YEAH.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.521
AND WE EXPECT EVERYBODY
TO BE THERE

12:52.605 --> 12:56.025
GIVING THEIR FULL SUPPORT.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.401
THAT MEANS YOU TOO, JEROME.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.694
- OF COURSE.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.779
- THANK YOU.

13:00.863 --> 13:01.697
- WHAT DID YOU PUT
ON JOY'S CLIPBOARD?

13:01.780 --> 13:04.366
- OH, JUST FABIAN'S POEM.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.951
[both chuckle]

13:06.035 --> 13:09.705
- OKAY, SO ON TO
ACTUAL IMPORTANT STUFF.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.541
NINA, FABIAN, WE NEED
TO RESCHEDULE YOUR DATE.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.210
- UM, YEAH.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.712
ABOUT THAT, AMBER, UM...

13:16.795 --> 13:21.008
- WE'RE--WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY
DOING DATES ANYMORE.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.885
- WHAT?

13:25.804 --> 13:26.138
- THEY'VE SPLIT UP?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.306
[laughs]

13:27.389 --> 13:29.558
NO, SERIOUSLY.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.060
- WHAT?

13:31.143 --> 13:32.603
NO WAY.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.313
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT,
ISN'T IT?

13:34.396 --> 13:36.023
ME AND DOUBLE DATE GATE.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.567
- NO, NO, NO, AMBER,
IT'S NOT YOU.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.736
IT'S US.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.075
- IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT,
ALFIE.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.409
- WAIT.

13:47.493 --> 13:51.789
AMBER, WHAT SHOULD
I HAVE DONE RIGHT?

13:51.872 --> 13:55.334
- YOU'RE A CREEP.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.461
- FINALLY GOT TO KNOW
THE REAL FABIAN RUTTER

13:57.545 --> 13:59.338
AND DUMPED HIM,
IS THAT IT, NINA?

13:59.421 --> 14:01.966
- IT WAS MUTUAL, JEROME.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.050
- HA-HA!

14:03.133 --> 14:04.301
SO NICK, MARA,

14:04.385 --> 14:06.595
WHEN'S YOUR BREAKUP
GOING PUBLIC?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.183
HUH?

14:11.267 --> 14:13.102
- HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO TELL ME, MICK?

14:13.185 --> 14:15.938
- NO.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.023
- [gasps]

14:18.107 --> 14:18.983
- MARA.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.863
- [laughs]

14:24.947 --> 14:27.241
- THAT BOY CERTAINLY KNOWS
HOW TO CLEAR A ROOM.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.410
- WOW.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.870
SO NO MORE FABINA.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.789
MAYBE THERE'S HOPE JAYBIAN YET.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.082
- [sighs]

14:38.252 --> 14:40.170
[vacuum whirring]

14:41.422 --> 14:43.507
- ARE WE ALL READY?

14:43.591 --> 14:44.633
- NEARLY.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.135
- LET'S HURRY ALONG, PLEASE.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.763
MR. ZIESTACK IS ALREADY HERE.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.474
NOW, IS THIS MICROPHONE WORKING?

14:52.558 --> 14:55.227
- NOT WHILE I'M WITHOUT AMBER!

14:55.311 --> 14:57.563
- OH, THIS WILL BE GOOD.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.566
- LEWIS, COME DOWN HERE.

15:00.649 --> 15:01.817
WE'RE ABOUT TO START THE BID.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.819
- NOT UNTIL KING TUT
GETS HIS QUEEN.

15:03.902 --> 15:06.071
I TICKED EVERY BOX.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.323
AND THERE'S A GLITTERY CHECKLIST
IN HER LOCKER,

15:07.406 --> 15:09.575
WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE
IS LEGALLY BINDING.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.535
- HE'S FINALLY LOST IT.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.662
- ALFIE'S MAKING A STAND!

15:13.746 --> 15:16.707
- SOMEONE GO GET AMBER QUICK.

15:16.790 --> 15:17.875
AND STALL MR. SWEET.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.419
- OKAY, ALFIE,
DON'T BE SILLY.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.920
JUST COME DOWN.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.756
- NOT UNTIL I--

15:23.839 --> 15:25.966
NOT UNTIL I GET WHAT'S MINE.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.302
- OUT OF THE WAY,
EVERYBODY.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.688
- WHAT ARE YOU HIDING
IN HERE FOR?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.315
- I'M NOT HIDING.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.108
JUST THINKING.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.444
- WERE YOU EVER GOING
TO TELL ME, MICK,

15:45.527 --> 15:47.071
OR JUST GO?

15:47.154 --> 15:48.697
- HANG ON.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.367
MY DAD BOUGHT ME THOSE TICKETS.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.993
PART OF THE BRIBE.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.205
I WASN'T INTENDING
ON USING THEM.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.957
- YOU WEREN'T?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.799
- HAND OVER THE KEY.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.258
NOW.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.010
- I SWALLOWED IT.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.261
- WHAT?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.430
IF WE LOSE THIS BID,

16:13.514 --> 16:15.057
I SHALL NOT REST

16:15.140 --> 16:19.687
UNTIL YOU ARE THROWN OUT
OF THIS SCHOOL.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.274
- ALFIE, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.402
- SEE, YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.945
YOU STILL THINK I'M A JOKE.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.114
- NO, I DON'T.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.742
I COULDN'T STAND IT IF YOU GOT
THROWN OUT OF THIS SCHOOL.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.954
- SO WHY WON'T YOU
BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

16:37.037 --> 16:38.997
- OKAY, I WILL.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.374
JUST TAKE THAT OFF.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.209
- NO MORE TESTS.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.670
TRIAL DATES
OR TELLING ME WHAT TO WEAR?

16:44.753 --> 16:47.715
- MMM, CAN'T PROMISE THAT ONE.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.008
- OKAY, I'M COMING DOWN.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.095
- NOW, THINK ABOUT THIS, VICTOR.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.764
SAWING ALFIE OUT
ISN'T GONNA LOOK GOOD EITHER.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.016
- GET OUT OF MY WAY.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.102
- HURRY, AMBER.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.438
- OH!

17:02.521 --> 17:04.397
plop!

17:04.481 --> 17:06.066
- NO, NO, NO,
WHERE DID IT GO?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.944
- OH, I'M SORRY.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.281
- UM, THIS WAY
MR. ZIESTACK.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.449
UM...

17:13.531 --> 17:17.161
MR. ZIESTACK, LET ME SHOW YOU
TO YOUR SEAT.

17:17.953 --> 17:20.455
- HELLO AGAIN.
- HELLO.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.624
- ARE YOU QUITE WELL?
- VERY WELL, THANK YOU.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.301
- THIS ACADEMY,
IT'S QUITE TEMPTING.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.470
- OF COURSE IT IS.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.305
- BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO

17:36.388 --> 17:42.644
BECAUSE THAT MEANS
BEING AWAY FROM YOU.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.897
- LOOK, MICK, I SHOULDN'T EVEN
COME INTO THIS EQUATION.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.775
- WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.652
I MEAN, I WANT IT ALL.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.654
- IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.324
- I KNOW.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.658
- YOU HAVE TO DECIDE.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.120
- WELL, I CAN'T.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.332
- OKAY.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.584
I'LL MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU.

18:05.667 --> 18:10.088
I WANT US TO FINISH.

18:10.172 --> 18:13.509
WE'RE TOO DIFFERENT.

18:13.592 --> 18:20.057
AND I ACTUALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD GO TO AUSTRALIA.

18:20.140 --> 18:24.353
FOR MY SAKE AS WELL AS YOURS.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.022
SORRY.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.538
- UM, TRUSTED WARM WELCOME
TO MR. GUSTAV ZIESTACK.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.872
[applause]

18:43.956 --> 18:46.041
IT'S A REAL PRIVILEGE...

18:46.125 --> 18:47.417
- WHERE'S MARA?

18:47.501 --> 18:49.878
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING
THE OPENING SPEECH.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.922
- YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT.
- WHAT?

18:52.005 --> 18:52.923
- YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.174
- WELL, HAVE YOU GOT
A COPY?

18:54.258 --> 18:56.134
- YEAH.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.471
- SO I AM NOW GOING TO HAND OVER
TO MS. MARA JAFFREY,

18:59.555 --> 19:01.557
WHO WILL GIVE
OUR OPENING ADDRESS.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.393
MARA.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.106
- [whispering] IT'S FINE.

19:09.189 --> 19:14.027
- UH, UH, THANK YOU,
MR. SWEET.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.656
- [clears throat]

19:17.739 --> 19:20.367
- [giggles]

19:22.327 --> 19:23.620
- WHAT IS SHE DOING?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.163
- DON'T WORRY.
SHE'LL GET THERE.

19:25.247 --> 19:28.584
- "THE QUEST WAS LONG
AND DIFFICULT.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.043
"I SOUGHT TREASURE.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.253
THE TREASURE WAS YOU."

19:40.095 --> 19:43.098
- SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO WAIT A REALLY LONG TIME

19:43.182 --> 19:45.392
FOR GOOD THINGS TO COME ALONG.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.437
BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS WORTH
THE WAIT.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.940
THIS LIBRARY HAS BEEN CLOSED
FOR AGES,

19:52.024 --> 19:55.986
WAITING FOR SOMETHING
TO GIVE IT PURPOSE AND MEANING.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.238
- SHE'S DOING REALLY GOOD.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.826
- AND THAT SOMETHING IS THE
TREASURES OF EGYPT EXHIBITION.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.119
- [sneezes]

20:04.202 --> 20:07.122
- WELCOME TO THE FROBISHER
LIBRARY, MR. ZIESTACK.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.707
- OW. OH, GROSS.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.083
OH, PLEASE.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.128
ACHOO!

20:13.211 --> 20:15.923
[laughter]

20:19.551 --> 20:23.805
- OUR SCHOOL HAS MANY LINKS
TO EGYPT'S PAST.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.350
AND HERE IS KING TUTANKHAMUN,

20:26.433 --> 20:30.520
CHAINED FAST TO OUR LIBRARY,

20:30.604 --> 20:35.400
A SYMBOL OF THOSE MANY LINKS.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.487
[laughter]

20:38.570 --> 20:39.905
- OH, YES.

20:39.988 --> 20:43.575
OUR LINKS TO EGYPT'S PAST
ARE VERY STRONG,

20:43.659 --> 20:44.952
AND THIS IS WHY.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.662
ENJOY THE FILM.

20:46.745 --> 20:50.082
[applause]

20:50.165 --> 20:52.668
- DAD?

20:52.751 --> 20:54.044
HI. IT'S ME.

20:54.127 --> 20:59.466
YEAH, THANKS FOR THOSE TICKETS.

20:59.549 --> 21:06.682
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA BE
USING THEM AFTER ALL.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.934
OKAY, SEE YOU LATER.

21:15.023 --> 21:18.527
- ANCIENT EGYPTOLOGIST
ROBERT FROBISHER-SMYTHE.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.071
AND SO SINCE IT'S GENESIS
IN 1890,

21:21.154 --> 21:23.490
THIS ESTATE HAS BEEN DEVOTED..

21:23.573 --> 21:27.953
- FABIAN, WHAT IF "1890"
IS THE COMBINATION CODE?

21:28.036 --> 21:29.079
- DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE?
