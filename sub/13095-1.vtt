00:38.000 --> 00:41.520
- Dr. Reed, good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?

00:41.680 --> 00:44.000
- I'm done with the samples.
- Well.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.920
I want to talk about your presentation.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.680
When it is finished,
I search for jobs.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.160
It requires work. Much work.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.520
- Do it?
- You should start over.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.160
- I do not understand.
- This looks like a dissertation.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.680
You must show
you can get appropriations.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.680
I tried. Everything is organized.
Summary, methods, results.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.200
Do not explain details.
It should inspire people.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.560
You must arouse people's interest.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.320
You need to lure investors.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.080
In this industry it is important
to. You must be good at it.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.440
- What do you recommend?
- You must attend Professor Riley.

01:24.600 --> 01:30.920
He is an expert in such things.
He can see you in the afternoon.

01:31.080 --> 01:37.760
- And my exam?
- You can do it here first. Sorry.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.320
- Professor Riley?
- Perfect timing. Come see here.

02:01.480 --> 02:06.600
It is Valentine Michael Smith
from "Stranger in a Strange Land".

02:06.760 --> 02:09.199
Raised on Mars and brought to Earth.

02:09.360 --> 02:14.920
One of my favorite sci-fi novels
and the inspiration for my course.

02:15.080 --> 02:20.400
Interesting, but unrealistic.
You can not breathe on Mars.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.720
The atmosphere is oxygen deficient.

02:22.880 --> 02:29.200
Addition there is no evidence
that aliens exist.

02:29.360 --> 02:34.040
- You microbiologist. Dr....
- Darcy Miller. I have not finished.

02:34.200 --> 02:38.120
I'm impressed. I could not
dissect a frog in school.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.280
I wrote a eulogy
to it instead.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.520
- Okay. Shall we start?
- Yes.

02:45.680 --> 02:49.560
I have read your presentation.
So we have to sell your idea?

02:49.720 --> 02:54.160
- I need to apply for grants.
- Yes. Of funding the arts.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.600
This is a Groucho Marx quote:

02:56.760 --> 02:59.720
"Money makes it possible
to avoid the things you hate."

02:59.880 --> 03:02.480
"I hate everything,
so money is handy."

03:05.560 --> 03:08.920
Okay. Let's take a look.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.600
You have shown many notes.

03:11.760 --> 03:15.440
Do not worry. To start
the beginning is always best.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.760
Help me a little.
What is "vibrio fischeri"?

03:20.920 --> 03:26.440
- Bioluminescent bacteria.
- Is the luminous? Cool.

03:26.600 --> 03:33.480
- What to do with the little cousins?
- We track toxicity in ecosystems.

03:33.640 --> 03:38.720
Great. What does it mean?

03:38.880 --> 03:44.560
We map the pollution
along the Oregon coast.

03:44.720 --> 03:50.880
It has fallen into the background
behind the facts and figures.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.320
Do you know what's missing? Feeling.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.080
Your passion should be felt.

03:56.240 --> 04:01.200
- Drop technology. It's boring.
- Boring?

04:03.000 --> 04:09.080
Not your research. But this
will not help you. Do you understand?

04:09.240 --> 04:11.840
No. Is my research is not thorough?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.640
Perhaps we need an exercise.

04:15.800 --> 04:19.959
So you write with feeling
and come out of your shell.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.560
So now I'm in a shell?

04:22.720 --> 04:26.880
It's just a metaphor.
I do not think you are inside a shell.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.400
At least not one that
I can not get you out of.

04:30.560 --> 04:35.160
- I do not make a good impression.
- This is no way.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.080
Wait. We got a bad start.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.240
We need food and drink.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.120
- Then you are more relaxed.
- I do not think.

04:44.280 --> 04:50.520
We can do it over lunch
or coffee. Ice tea perhaps?

05:06.920 --> 05:09.960
- Dad?
- In here.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.120
What happened to the plant
in math class?

05:17.280 --> 05:22.200
It got square roots.
Are you working on a new course plan?

05:22.360 --> 05:25.680
No, I teach algebra
this semester.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.960
You need new material father.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.720
- How was your meeting?
- Poorly. The guy is weird.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.840
He do not appreciate my work.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.080
- What did your mentor?
- I will work with another.

05:44.240 --> 05:47.840
But she wants
that I work with him.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.680
Do not be sad.
It impairs your judgment.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.560
- Use your energy...
- In finding a solution.

05:56.720 --> 06:02.200
- You must give him a chance.
- Yes. I guess I have no choice.

06:04.280 --> 06:10.080
The weather should worsen.
You can sleep here.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.680
I can make grilled sandwiches
and vegetable soup, as you like.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.520
It sounds nice, Dad.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.400
Do not forget
mother's birthday on 16

06:21.560 --> 06:24.440
I have not.
We should book a table.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.040
I always do, Dad. Do not worry.

06:31.480 --> 06:35.520
I wonder what mom's advice
on my presentation would be.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.280
- Why do you say that?
- I'm curious.

06:41.640 --> 06:45.880
We can go to the cemetery,
before we go out to eat.

06:46.920 --> 06:51.440
No, my darling.
But you can go there if you want.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.840
You can also choose the restaurant.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.760
But make sure
it is one that I like.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.240
Okay, Dad.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.680
Good night, Mom.

08:09.920 --> 08:15.400
- Oh no.
- Beware. There is glass everywhere.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.200
There are over water way over here.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.160
- What a mess.
- Say the least.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.880
- When you were up here last?
- It does not happen often.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.000
- Is it my old pram?
- Yes.

08:35.679 --> 08:39.080
- Do you still have it?
- Why give it away?

08:40.960 --> 08:45.040
What are these old syting?
Is it mom's?

08:46.280 --> 08:50.840
I can clean up here later.
You have enough to think about.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.320
You do not like to throw things out,
but you must. Everything is soaked.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.200
- But not now.
- It should not be delayed.

08:59.360 --> 09:03.760
I have some time before I must
lunch with Aunt Kathy.

09:03.920 --> 09:08.400
I'll get some fans
in the garage and try to dry the floor.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.560
Father. Look what I found.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.800
It lay among mother's old stuff.
It's her handwriting.

10:22.320 --> 10:26.640
This is a list of things
she would give away.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.720
There is Aunt Kathy,
but who are the others?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.160
Your mother's old friends, I think.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.160
Do you remember
what it was about?

10:36.680 --> 10:39.280
No, I can not.

10:39.440 --> 10:44.120
- When is your lunch? With Kathy.
- It was I almost forgot.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.440
She tries safe
to find a man for you.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.720
Ring later, so I know
that you are returned safely.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.880
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.920
There are four names and four things.

11:09.080 --> 11:14.520
A vase, champagne glass, chairs and
one recipe. The book was to you.

11:14.680 --> 11:19.680
Your mother's cookbook.
Marianne food was quite magical.

11:19.840 --> 11:24.000
Especially her desserts.
I have fantasized about her fudge.

11:24.160 --> 11:29.120
- Did cookbook in the attic?
- No, but there is certainly still.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.720
Let me know if you find it.
I would like to have it.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.280
I showed dad it here.

11:36.440 --> 11:41.640
- What did he say?
- Little. As usual.

11:41.800 --> 11:47.880
Some have one big love in life.
For your father was Marianne.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.800
She always gave.
She always tried to help others.

11:51.960 --> 11:57.680
She never kept anything back.
Whether she was happy or sad.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.920
That I loved her.

12:00.080 --> 12:04.120
I wish Dad could talk about that stuff.
He never talks about her.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.160
Your father lost a part of himself,
when she died.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.920
We all did.
But he was never himself again.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.640
I remember
the evening, the accident took place.

12:16.800 --> 12:22.880
The police were already there. They said
that a student had driven drunk -

12:23.040 --> 12:25.040
- And had driven through a red light.

12:25.200 --> 12:32.040
He also died that night.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.960
I have no memories of my mother.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.160
I can not remember
how she looked.

12:40.320 --> 12:45.400
- Darcy, you were only a year.
- Yet.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.160
Seeing anyone? Give me the details.

12:49.320 --> 12:53.480
I have no time.
All my time is spent doctorate.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.200
I have a friend
have a son your age.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.920
I have seen photos.
I can arrange something.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.840
Father warned me. You used
to do the same with him.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.400
My talent was wasted on him.

13:06.560 --> 13:10.520
When I arranged it,
he went no more than two dates.

13:10.680 --> 13:15.000
Perhaps I accept your offer.
Maybe. Later.

13:15.160 --> 13:20.440
I must act. Mindy comes over.
We cook together sometimes.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.800
Greet her.
We have not done talking about this.

13:23.960 --> 13:27.320
A date with a cute guy
never hurt anyone.

13:27.480 --> 13:32.160
See you. Goodbye.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.440
- Darcy?
- Hi.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.520
- What a surprise.
- Yes. Well, I met you.

14:04.680 --> 14:08.840
I owe you an apology.
I should not have gone yesterday.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.240
I should apologize.

14:11.400 --> 14:17.000
Sometimes you do not get told
what you want.

14:18.080 --> 14:22.280
I need help. My mentor
say that you are the best.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.560
So what do you say?
Do you still help me?

14:25.720 --> 14:31.440
I owe dr. Reed
a favor or two, so...

14:31.600 --> 14:34.240
Okay. You persuaded me.

14:34.400 --> 14:39.360
How fantastic. You thought of me.
I was thinking about you. And here we are.

14:39.520 --> 14:44.720
- The universe has brought us together.
- Universe? Let us not exaggerate.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.040
Are you really an English teacher?

14:47.200 --> 14:50.320
Theology or philosophy
shown more your style.

14:50.480 --> 14:54.840
One topic in life is limiting.
I grow all my interests.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.680
How does your calendar look like?
Pardon.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.640
- A shopping list?
- No, it's my mother.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.920
Mist it.
Maybe she will have it back.

15:06.080 --> 15:10.320
- She died long ago.
- I'm sorry.

15:10.480 --> 15:16.560
I have found it. It is a list
of things she would give away.

15:16.720 --> 15:20.920
- Maybe she would give it to you.
- I said she was dead, right?

15:21.080 --> 15:25.000
Perhaps it was something special,
as you should have.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.400
You complete what she started?

15:28.720 --> 15:31.440
- I do not know.
- That is a good idea.

15:33.280 --> 15:39.880
This is the type of exercise,
which can help you with your writing.

15:41.160 --> 15:45.800
- What did he say?
- That it should convey my passion.

15:45.960 --> 15:51.120
Does he think
your mother is a kind of guardian angel?

15:51.280 --> 15:56.400
- What do you say to that?
- He's crazy, but I'm on it.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.960
- Why?
- I'll talk to my mother's friends.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.600
- Does that sound crazy?
- No.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.880
It does not sound crazy.
But the guy on the other hand...

16:06.040 --> 16:09.160
- It is another matter.
- You should just know.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.360
Hello. Is Elaine Parsons?

17:30.520 --> 17:35.080
My name is Darcy Miller. Yes, Darcy.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.800
Excuse me.
I need your opinion.

17:54.960 --> 18:00.960
- E red or white best?
- I like them both.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.680
They are beautiful.
I can not decide.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.720
Should You Choose? Take a little of everything.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.200
You're right.
In this case is more improved.

18:11.360 --> 18:16.480
- I asked the right person.
- Good luck.

18:19.360 --> 18:24.640
Excuse me. Hello.
I am looking for Elaine Parsons.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.120
- Is it you who is Darcy?
- Yes.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.680
I can hardly believe it.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.560
- Where did you find it?
- Do you recognize it?

18:38.720 --> 18:42.800
Your mother and I had many memories
connected to it.

18:42.960 --> 18:47.160
- Curiously, you show up now.
- What do you mean?

18:50.480 --> 18:56.720
It's hard to explain.
It's nice to finally meet you.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.800
- We studied together.
- How did I?

19:03.960 --> 19:08.480
We took the same occupation. We sat
next to each other on the first day.

19:08.640 --> 19:13.560
The teacher came in
and articulated every word.

19:13.720 --> 19:18.560
We looked at each other and started
laugh. And then we were best friends.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.680
And what about this?

19:21.840 --> 19:27.320
You probably know this. Your mother
favorite flowers were peonies.

19:27.480 --> 19:33.080
- I did not actually.
- She loved them.

19:33.240 --> 19:38.160
She made bouquets and gave people them.
She loved to see people be happy.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.160
A year after we met -

19:41.320 --> 19:47.080
- I bought the vase and set peonies
in your mother's birthday.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.560
- She loved it.
- And we made a deal.

19:50.720 --> 19:57.560
I got the vase back and did
the same to the next birthday.

19:57.720 --> 20:00.600
It was our little tradition.

20:01.720 --> 20:05.800
- Her birthday is approaching.
- Yes.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.360
Was that what you meant before -

20:08.520 --> 20:11.520
- When you were surprised
that I got now?

20:11.680 --> 20:14.480
No.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.720
I want to show you.

20:16.880 --> 20:22.600
Can you come home to me? I live
close. You can come after work.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.960
Yes, I would like to.
Now I'm curious.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.520
- 17:30?
- Fine.

20:30.680 --> 20:35.120
My mother would probably have liked
that you got it here.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.200
Thank you.

20:41.880 --> 20:47.200
- Did not she say what it was?
- She'd better show me.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.800
But I was talking about your mother, right?
Did it help?

20:50.960 --> 20:55.280
A little, but I was surprised
the conversation direction.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.080
I pay. I have to go.

21:00.240 --> 21:04.120
I have to meet my supervisor.
We need to look at test scores.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.480
I have a meeting with type guy.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.760
Oh well. You never mentioned,
what he looks like.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.360
Does he at least good?

21:12.520 --> 21:18.600
When you have spoken to him,
it is totally irrelevant.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.800
I would prefer
one that is more like me.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.080
Think of it as a good experience.

21:24.240 --> 21:29.360
How sweet. Why am I not
better that you say it?

21:32.320 --> 21:35.000
- Yes?
- Aunt Kathy.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.520
- I have found the mother's recipe.
- Do you have it?

21:38.680 --> 21:40.920
It has a red cover.
Is that it?

21:41.080 --> 21:44.080
Yes. Can I borrow the?

21:44.240 --> 21:46.640
Course. I come with it.

21:46.800 --> 21:51.040
- I have to run. See you soon.
- Yes, mother.

21:51.200 --> 21:55.360
No, I'm not jumping
breakfast above.

21:55.520 --> 21:59.640
Mom, I have to run now.
I love you. Goodbye.

21:59.800 --> 22:04.440
Hello. Why does my mother to me,
like I was eight years old?

22:04.600 --> 22:08.080
Maybe because you have a poster
with aliens.

22:08.240 --> 22:12.040
She thinks I paint with crayons
and a lunch box.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.200
- Why we meet here?
- This time it should go right to.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.440
I give coffee. Come on.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.600
She loved to give people flowers.
Great.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.800
- What else have you found?
- Little.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.200
It was very telling.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.720
Jaså? How?

22:32.880 --> 22:36.240
To share something you love,
makes people happy.

22:36.400 --> 22:42.440
They are happy for something you yourself
love. Therefore it is important.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.720
Why is it you do,
important to you?

22:45.880 --> 22:49.400
The maritime ecosystem
underlies all life.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.920
It affects all organisms
on our planet.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.360
- Protects we do not know, are all affected.
- That is what I mean.

22:57.520 --> 23:02.600
When you express yourself with feeling,
you awaken people's interest.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.320
Feeling. Yes it is true.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.520
- What is it?
- Nothing.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.720
I do not know anyone like you.
Your left brain controls you.

23:14.880 --> 23:19.640
It's a compliment when it
come from with your imagination.

23:19.800 --> 23:26.040
You read about mars men. You love
probably unicorns and fairies.

23:26.200 --> 23:30.680
- Tinker Bell is my favorite.
- That was what I meant.

23:30.840 --> 23:36.880
When you visit your mother's friend, because
she will show you a secret?

23:37.040 --> 23:40.160
It's not a secret.
She wants to show me something.

23:40.320 --> 23:43.440
- I wonder what it is?
- Nothing with aliens.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.080
Fate is interesting.
Everything happens for a reason.

23:47.240 --> 23:52.680
- We just know until later.
- Ridiculous.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.760
- Maybe this was why it happened.
- What?

23:55.920 --> 24:00.200
The damaged window on your father's attic.
Maybe it's your mother's plan.

24:00.360 --> 24:04.400
Now you go too far,
and make this into something crazy.

24:04.560 --> 24:07.800
- If I go too far?
- Yes. This is irrational.

24:07.960 --> 24:12.320
You must be born in Virgo.
When is your birthday?

24:12.480 --> 24:16.760
- You read enough always your horoscope.
- I try to avoid it.

24:16.920 --> 24:21.720
- Your mother's list goes deeper.
- I do not think.

24:21.880 --> 24:25.360
- How do we find out?
- I refute you.

24:25.520 --> 24:30.120
I find out that there is no
something strange and tells you that.

24:30.280 --> 24:36.480
- Okay. But you can not hide anything.
- I could never dream of.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.880
How was she?
What was she interested in?

24:47.160 --> 24:50.080
Nature. Like me.

24:50.240 --> 24:55.520
Marianne had a nice apartment.
The backyard was completely deserted.

24:55.680 --> 25:00.600
It looked like a desert.
So we began to plant things.

25:00.760 --> 25:05.840
- Think that she had green fingers.
- She had really.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.840
So I began to change my mind
concerning my career.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.120
Your mother encouraged me
to open the nursery.

25:13.280 --> 25:17.480
- Did she?
- She knew it was the right thing.

25:18.480 --> 25:22.680
- Can I take some pictures?
- Absolutely.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.680
Here. Keep it here.

25:32.240 --> 25:37.080
Thank you for inviting me
to show me these.

25:37.240 --> 25:43.200
You should see the pictures.
But it was not what I meant.

25:43.360 --> 25:46.080
There is something else. Come on.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.720
Wow. Have you made all this?

25:50.880 --> 25:55.640
- It grows year by year.
- It is very beautiful.

25:55.800 --> 26:01.720
Every time I think I'm done,
it makes me want to plant something new.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.400
Peonies. You planted them to mother.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.880
Shortly after Marianne died.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.880
- The blossomed never.
- What do you mean?

26:13.040 --> 26:16.960
The bloomed last week.
Just in time for you to see them.

26:17.120 --> 26:20.600
- It makes no sense.
- Strange, is not it?

26:20.760 --> 26:24.480
There must be a reason.
Was there something wrong with the soil?

26:24.640 --> 26:28.000
- Did you change anything?
- No.

26:28.160 --> 26:32.640
- Maybe they did not get enough sunlight.
- They've been here all the time.

26:36.520 --> 26:41.680
Call me crazy, but I think
there is something more to it.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.720
As if it was fate.

27:50.360 --> 27:55.000
Hello. So we meet again.

27:55.160 --> 28:00.920
- Hello. Should I help you with them?
- Thanks, that would be great.

28:01.080 --> 28:05.480
It was a bad storm.
Well, it took on.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.960
- Hello. My name is Beverly.
- I'm Darcy.

28:10.120 --> 28:14.120
- I help with the flowers?
- No, I'll fix it.

28:14.280 --> 28:18.360
- Have a good day.
- Thank you. You too.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.080
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Beverly.

28:25.160 --> 28:28.840
- What do you think?
- Preamble is better.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.360
And what about the rest?

28:31.520 --> 28:38.400
Do not forget that the opening is better.
Do not worry. It's a good start.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.000
It's no good. It should be perfect.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.640
- Do not think so.
- How?

28:44.800 --> 28:48.640
You're missing the most important.
This should be fun.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.600
- You talk about something you love.
- It must be good.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.560
Relax. It is not an equation.

28:55.720 --> 29:01.840
If you treat it that way, you
unhappy, and it shows in the text.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.720
Oh no. It's my mom.

29:07.880 --> 29:12.640
She's worried that I work
too hard and not getting enough sleep.

29:12.800 --> 29:18.160
- She takes care only of you.
- She never stops.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.360
We have not talked about our bet.

29:21.520 --> 29:26.320
- What would your mother's friend show you?
- Nothing.

29:26.480 --> 29:32.880
She had planted some flowers
to my mother that she wanted to show me.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.720
- What are you not telling?
- Nothing.

29:39.360 --> 29:43.760
According to her, the flowers never
jumped out before now.

29:45.760 --> 29:50.880
Interestingly . Do not you think
that it's just a little important?

29:51.040 --> 29:53.920
No. There are probably
a logical explanation.

29:54.080 --> 30:00.560
There is many strange things in the world,
but it's all random.

30:00.720 --> 30:05.360
Even if something is unlikely
it can still happen.

30:05.520 --> 30:10.360
The theoretical match the practical.
This is what we see.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.800
Admit it.
You are from the planet Vulcan, right?

30:14.960 --> 30:17.760
Spock must be your uncle?

30:17.920 --> 30:20.480
Is that a no?

30:21.920 --> 30:26.400
You are not impartial enough
to judge our bets.

30:26.560 --> 30:30.240
- I thought I was a realist.
- And it worries me.

30:30.400 --> 30:34.960
If you win, we must make sure
that the facts are not distorted.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.640
You will make things more objective?

30:37.800 --> 30:41.800
- Yes. I should take with you.
- Do you mean that?

30:41.960 --> 30:46.320
If we both are, no
distort or hide the truth.

30:46.480 --> 30:50.240
- If you dare.
- It's a deal.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.520
I have to drop my mother's cookbook.
Take.

30:53.680 --> 30:57.800
Explain to me the way. First I fly
out the window. So what?

30:57.960 --> 31:01.320
- The second star to the right?
- I'm texting you.

31:01.480 --> 31:05.360
Do not forget to think happy thoughts.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.960
THE HERE IS FOR YOU. ELAINE.

31:49.320 --> 31:53.200
- Fine flowers.
- Yeah, right?

31:53.360 --> 31:59.520
- What happened then?
- I said he could go.

31:59.680 --> 32:04.720
- Do you know what you're doing?
- He believes that the universe is doing everything.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.240
He still believes in the tooth fairy.

32:07.400 --> 32:10.080
- Now you can enjoy his company.
- Fun.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.640
You do know that you're going to be seen?

32:12.800 --> 32:14.880
Yes, but it is necessary.

32:15.040 --> 32:19.920
- Perhaps you might like to talk to him.
- Not even a little. Wait and see.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.920
He's not allowed
to disprove me.

32:33.480 --> 32:37.200
- While. I have a good feeling.
- Feeling?

32:37.360 --> 32:43.680
Did you say "sensation"? Do me a favor
: Behave more normal.

32:43.840 --> 32:47.160
No crazy questions.
This is my family.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.800
- You mean more rational?
- Yes.

32:49.960 --> 32:53.760
- Sensible and logical. Just like you.
- Exact.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.320
There is one problem. I can not.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.600
It goes against my nature.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.840
There it is. Great.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
- You must be Nathan.
- Nice to meet you.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.280
You did not, he looked good.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.560
- Do not you think?
- Yes, do not you think that?

33:15.720 --> 33:24.600
It's perfect timing. Come on in.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.960
Why is it perfect timing?

33:27.120 --> 33:30.520
Mike, who is renovating the bathroom
fell from the ladder.

33:30.680 --> 33:33.280
- Is he okay?
- Yes. The arm is in plaster.

33:33.440 --> 33:37.160
But I would bake something for him,
for he lives here in the street.

33:37.320 --> 33:42.600
- So cookbook is a great help.
- It's perfect timing.

33:42.760 --> 33:46.920
The question is what.
There is so much to choose from.

33:47.080 --> 33:51.840
Sponge cake.
Or cake with lemon and poppy seeds.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
Your mother used to make brownies
with pecans and caramel.

33:57.160 --> 34:01.560
- Yes. Skildpaddebrownies.
- I get hungry of the talk.

34:01.720 --> 34:06.400
I had probably not reckoned with the
having to bake, but will you help?

34:06.560 --> 34:07.960
Yes, thank you.

34:08.120 --> 34:12.360
Great. Nathan, aprons
are in the closet around the corner.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.880
Forget him, I talked about.
This guy's discretion.

34:19.040 --> 34:23.360
- No, we just work together.
- Do more than that.

34:30.520 --> 34:34.480
I am looking forward to taste
my mother's old recipe.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.960
- You are almost professional.
- I've been practicing.

34:38.120 --> 34:42.480
I used to help my mother
in the kitchen. I also often food.

34:42.639 --> 34:48.040
I care actually dinner party
and game night once a month.

34:48.199 --> 34:53.360
Next time tonight.
I are both welcome.

34:53.520 --> 34:59.160
I can not, but Darcy would like.
She is single. Are you too?

34:59.320 --> 35:03.520
Ignore her. I have to write
and plans with a friend.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.320
What plans?

35:06.480 --> 35:09.800
- We have to cook.
- Your friend is also welcome.

35:09.960 --> 35:13.040
They want to come.
Then it's settled.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.840
What?

35:25.680 --> 35:31.040
- Mike? So you get a little better.
- Thank you.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.760
- Did you do them?
- Along with the two.

35:33.920 --> 35:38.000
This is my niece Darcy,
and this is Nathan.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.880
Nice to meet you. Thank you.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.240
Skildpaddebrownies? You, I
not eaten since I was a child.

35:46.400 --> 35:50.760
I made them with my nanny
Marianne many years ago.

35:50.920 --> 35:55.320
- What was her last name?
- Burkhart.

35:56.640 --> 36:01.560
- It was my mother's maiden name.
- Was it your mother? It is then lie?

36:06.880 --> 36:09.520
It's incredible,
that he knew Marianne.

36:09.680 --> 36:15.360
- What a coincidence.
- These coincidences are everywhere.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.320
I loved it on
that they had fun.

36:18.480 --> 36:22.280
How typical Marianne,
that her brownies were crooked.

36:22.440 --> 36:27.040
It meant nothing that they were ugly.
She said that as they tasted better.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.040
It's about
to enjoy what you do.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.680
- Although it is not perfect.
- It is true.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.680
Nathan, you can get some brownies
home.

36:36.840 --> 36:40.560
- There's no need.
- Seriously? I insist.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.640
I like him.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.440
Hi, Dad. What is it?

36:57.600 --> 37:02.040
I downloaded
the new pane to the ceiling.

37:02.200 --> 37:07.640
- Do you have our old video player?
- Yes, and it should be up to the ceiling again.

37:07.800 --> 37:11.920
- You must never use it again.
- Never say never.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.600
- You have collector's passion.
- It does not make me anything.

37:15.760 --> 37:20.720
I found something you like.
Come by and see it.

37:23.280 --> 37:28.480
I found it here in the attic yesterday.
It was your mother.

37:35.720 --> 37:40.520
- A Key. What's it for?
- I have no clue.

37:40.680 --> 37:44.960
She wore it when we met.
I thought you would have it.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.920
Thank you, Dad. Now it's my turn.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.560
Aunt Kathy and I have baked
mother's brownies.

38:01.720 --> 38:05.120
I understand why her desserts
were famous.

38:06.400 --> 38:10.960
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, darling.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.320
I would not make you sad.

38:14.480 --> 38:18.800
I begin with the window.

38:21.800 --> 38:28.120
- Thank you train with.
- I am looking forward to meeting him.

38:30.480 --> 38:35.560
The last two guests.
I love it when new people.

38:35.720 --> 38:39.560
You must be Mindy. Come on in.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.200
After you.

38:45.200 --> 38:49.200
Let me introduce you to everyone.
This is Dave and Samantha -

38:49.360 --> 38:52.640
- Oscar, Carrie and Sofia.

38:52.800 --> 38:58.480
Mindy and Darcy's scientists.
Judge them not for that.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.400
Hearts are always wild.
I do not have to bet money.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.800
Even scientists like
card game. What do you say?

39:05.960 --> 39:11.000
We are with.
And beware. We play to win.

39:17.440 --> 39:22.160
- Nathan, I have fun really.
- Well.

39:22.320 --> 39:27.400
How many times have Mindy
won? Eight? She needs me.

39:27.560 --> 39:31.400
Who would have thought
that I was so good at playing cards.

39:31.560 --> 39:38.360
We're scientists. We are good
numbers and probability.

39:38.520 --> 39:41.120
Do not underestimate people like us.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.520
I have learned my lesson.

39:45.200 --> 39:48.080
It's nice to see you be social.

39:48.240 --> 39:54.440
I was worried that you always
were locked in a laboratory.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.320
Nice to see
that your friends are people.

39:57.480 --> 40:01.000
I began to believe
that they were cartoon characters.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.680
It's hard to believe.
I know.

40:04.760 --> 40:08.440
- It's nice out here.
- Yeah, right?

40:08.600 --> 40:11.240
It looked like this when I bought the house.

40:12.920 --> 40:18.400
Come and see. I want to show you something.

40:21.400 --> 40:26.960
Remember to use your imagination.
Imagine this without rain.

40:29.280 --> 40:32.760
What do you think?
It's quite magical, right?

40:32.920 --> 40:38.960
Imagine a table here,
some chairs, maybe candles.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.680
- Candles?
- Yes.

40:42.840 --> 40:47.160
Men can also suffer the kind.

40:47.320 --> 40:51.200
But it must just not.
Old rules about masculinity.

40:51.360 --> 40:57.040
You accept your romantic side
despite old stereotypes.

40:57.200 --> 41:00.880
Why should you stick with them?

41:07.920 --> 41:12.920
My dad gave me this today.
It has been my mother.

41:13.080 --> 41:20.080
I gave him some of our brownies.
He reacted wildly weird.

41:20.240 --> 41:23.480
I think
that it caused him to miss her.

41:23.640 --> 41:28.240
- Do you know what the key is for?
- I have no idea.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.840
It is interesting
these things pop up.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.400
And they lead wisdom with them.

41:34.560 --> 41:39.120
It turns out to be
a very good exercise, right?

41:39.280 --> 41:42.600
Normally I would say,
it is brittle.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.720
But now?

41:46.160 --> 41:48.200
I do not know.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.640
We'd better go back inside.

42:09.280 --> 42:13.760
- What do you think?
- Better, but it is not complete.

42:13.920 --> 42:19.200
Are you working with Professor Riley?
Continue with it. He knows his stuff.

42:19.360 --> 42:24.520
Office has set a deadline.
I need the next Friday.

42:24.680 --> 42:28.320
- No problem. You get it.
- Keep me informed.

43:04.600 --> 43:07.320
There is only one sentence in this section.

43:07.480 --> 43:10.440
"Sea Life is
the most beautiful in the world -

43:10.600 --> 43:14.600
- and it caught my love,
as long as I can remember."

43:14.760 --> 43:19.160
- Good. But where is the rest?
- I deleted it.

43:19.320 --> 43:23.440
It sounded stupid. I was scared,
what dr. Reed would think.

43:23.600 --> 43:28.640
Do not be afraid of others' opinions.
It blocks the positive energy.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.880
- Maybe it's not so bad.
- You're missing the best part.

43:33.040 --> 43:38.400
When someone reads what you have to say,
and like it. As I just did.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.800
This is the beginning
on something interesting.

43:41.960 --> 43:47.080
- It's scary.
- Well. Continue to explore it.

43:47.240 --> 43:51.440
- How do I get it done?
- You'll achieve it.

43:51.600 --> 43:57.400
- Breathe. Do not stop yourself.
- I must go.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.840
- You need a break.
- I do not have time.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.320
When I feel overwhelmed,
it is time to change focus.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.880
- Let's enjoy ourselves.
- What do you mean?

44:10.040 --> 44:13.160
There is a place
who make exceptional pizzas.

44:13.320 --> 44:16.880
There is a black-bean
and peppers.

44:17.040 --> 44:19.480
It sounds weird and rather ugly.

44:19.640 --> 44:23.400
- You have not tried it.
- I should work.

44:23.560 --> 44:27.800
Come on. It's good for you.
I promise that you're home early.

44:29.320 --> 44:32.800
- What did the zero to eight century?
- I do not know.

44:32.960 --> 44:36.840
- "Beautiful belt."
- On my father will love.

44:38.480 --> 44:43.480
- Do you eat all that?
- Admit it. Your are horrible.

44:43.640 --> 44:46.960
You like peperonipizzaen,
which I ordered.

44:47.120 --> 44:51.440
Strange and unusual is daring,
but it does not edible.

44:51.600 --> 44:55.800
It's true.
But admit it: You're having fun.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.200
Perhaps. Little.

44:58.360 --> 45:03.560
- I must say that it looks good on you.
- Thank you.

45:04.640 --> 45:08.400
You listened to life,
and it paid off.

45:08.560 --> 45:13.400
You should not abandon your mother's list.
I mean it.

45:13.560 --> 45:19.600
Believe it or not, but things happen
not controlled by fate.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.640
You are impossible.
Let's say you're right.

45:22.800 --> 45:25.160
There is a meaning to it here.

45:25.320 --> 45:28.120
What is it
universe trying to say?

45:28.280 --> 45:33.200
If you do not know the answer,
it has not been revealed yet.

45:33.360 --> 45:36.800
You know
that you sound like a fortune cookie?

45:36.960 --> 45:39.040
We are talking about you right now.

45:39.200 --> 45:42.320
- I've done your homework.
- What do you mean?

45:42.480 --> 45:47.000
I have researched the last two names:
Molly Dixon and Russ Hamilton.

45:47.160 --> 45:50.520
Glasses are to Molly,
and the chairs are to Russ.

45:50.680 --> 45:55.280
- Did you do research?
- You can not do it all yourself.

45:55.440 --> 45:58.280
There is no Russ Hamilton
nearby.

45:58.440 --> 46:02.160
I did a major search,
but found too many.

46:02.320 --> 46:05.760
It's fate,
who say that we should give up.

46:05.920 --> 46:08.200
I was more lucky with the glasses.

46:08.360 --> 46:11.680
Kathy recognized
name "Molly Dixon".

46:11.840 --> 46:15.520
Molly moved to Albany.
She has a shop in the city.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.560
What do you say
to drive up there tomorrow?

46:18.720 --> 46:22.960
- Did you call Aunt Kathy?
- We baked together.

46:27.360 --> 46:30.480
I should go home. It is late.

46:30.640 --> 46:37.080
I'll get you tomorrow. The store opens at
. 11, then we say 10:30?

46:37.240 --> 46:40.480
Okay.

46:48.520 --> 46:50.520
Here they are.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.800
- Hello.
- Hi.

46:57.960 --> 47:04.480
Let's run. I shall be back,
so I can work on my application.

47:34.160 --> 47:36.520
It must be here.

47:43.520 --> 47:46.760
- Can I help?
- We're looking for Molly Dixon.

47:46.920 --> 47:49.160
She has not arrived yet.

47:49.320 --> 47:52.680
- Do you know when she comes?
- Anytime.

47:52.840 --> 47:55.240
- Is it okay that we wait?
- Yes.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.240
Look around for so long.

47:57.400 --> 48:00.720
- Great.
- Thank you.

48:07.360 --> 48:10.600
- How long have we waited?
- At least an hour.

48:10.760 --> 48:12.800
What should we do?

48:18.160 --> 48:21.480
- Have you heard from Molly?
- No.

48:21.640 --> 48:25.520
- She has her own schedule.
- We might come back later.

48:25.680 --> 48:29.040
- Will you leave a message?
- No, it does not matter.

48:29.200 --> 48:32.040
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

48:34.680 --> 48:38.320
- We should have called before.
- We can take back.

48:38.480 --> 48:42.400
I do not know, Nathan.
I think we should give up.

48:42.560 --> 48:45.680
If you're right,
we should see it as a sign.

48:48.360 --> 48:50.560
- Oh no.
- What is it?

48:50.720 --> 48:55.320
- Warning light flashes.
- Say you're kidding.

48:55.480 --> 48:58.560
- We are in the middle of nowhere.
- I know.

49:13.240 --> 49:15.600
- Thank God.
- Hi.

49:15.760 --> 49:18.840
- I thought I was stranded.
- Are you okay?

49:19.000 --> 49:22.600
Yes. There was smoke from the hood,
so I stopped.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.760
We also have problems with the car.

49:28.520 --> 49:33.600
I thought anyway.
Warning light went out.

49:33.760 --> 49:37.600
- Has one of you a phone?
- Of course.

49:37.760 --> 49:40.480
I forgot my home.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.760
- Take min.
- Thank you.

49:52.880 --> 49:57.920
My car broke down, and I have
need help. Can you send someone?

49:58.080 --> 50:03.320
- My name is Molly Dixon.
- Excuse me.

50:03.480 --> 50:08.000
- Are you Molly?
- Just a moment. Yes.

50:08.160 --> 50:12.640
- One who owns the shop in Albany?
- Yes it is me.

50:14.040 --> 50:16.440
Do I know you?

50:20.800 --> 50:23.920
Think that I drove past
right where I was standing.

50:24.080 --> 50:28.160
Well, we stopped
at the time.

50:28.320 --> 50:30.560
What did you find out about your car?

50:30.720 --> 50:37.200
Him who downloaded your car, looked at
, saying that nothing was wrong.

50:37.360 --> 50:41.240
Thank God for that.
And because you drove me home.

50:41.400 --> 50:45.400
Well, I will be for dinner.
It's the least I can do.

50:46.640 --> 50:51.760
- It's pretty simple.
- I love potatoes with rosemary.

50:51.920 --> 50:56.400
How did you two?

50:56.560 --> 50:59.280
Nathan helps me
with a school project.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.760
Well, I asked.
I thought you were a couple.

51:06.040 --> 51:10.320
Can I ask you something?
Do you know what this key fits?

51:10.480 --> 51:14.280
It was my mother. I do not know
what it's for. Do you?

51:14.440 --> 51:18.800
No, I'm sorry. I dont do that.

51:18.960 --> 51:21.720
How did it all start?

51:21.880 --> 51:25.200
I found a list
as my mother wrote.

51:25.360 --> 51:31.400
I think
that she would give you these.

51:37.880 --> 51:41.520
Wow. They are beautiful.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.280
Got you my mother near?

51:45.440 --> 51:50.720
I was a teacher before I opened
store. We were colleagues.

51:50.880 --> 51:54.320
But she stopped work
and started a family.

51:54.480 --> 51:59.240
- Why champagne glass?
- It was probably my wedding.

52:01.440 --> 52:04.880
Soon after we met,
I was in love.

52:05.040 --> 52:08.920
I was madly in love with a guy.

52:09.080 --> 52:12.720
But I had been hurt
and was wary.

52:12.880 --> 52:17.640
- Would you give me the vegetables?
- Of course.

52:17.800 --> 52:21.000
I talked to Marianne about it.

52:21.160 --> 52:24.400
I cried and she cried.

52:24.560 --> 52:28.840
It was a nice thing by your mother.
If you told her something -

52:29.000 --> 52:34.040
- It was as if she lived through
it with a.

52:35.200 --> 52:37.760
- What happened?
- She gave me a piece of advice.

52:37.920 --> 52:40.440
She said that I should bet again.

52:40.600 --> 52:45.280
For if it was true love,
I might not experience it again.

52:45.440 --> 52:50.280
I'm glad that I did it,
the man is still my husband.

52:50.440 --> 52:52.440
How wonderful.

52:52.600 --> 52:59.280
He is traveling with his job. It is a shame. He would have liked to meet you.

53:00.600 --> 53:03.800
Do you remember other things about my mother,
which is something special?

53:03.960 --> 53:08.160
There was one thing
I always admired her for that.

53:08.320 --> 53:11.480
She knew exactly
what she wanted in her life.

53:11.640 --> 53:15.840
I was the opposite. I fumbled
me forward. But she knew it.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.480
What was that?

53:20.400 --> 53:22.600
It was about you.

53:22.760 --> 53:28.800
Marianne's biggest dream in life
was to become a mother.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.080
When you came...

53:33.760 --> 53:38.040
... She would just see you grow up
and be happy.

53:43.880 --> 53:46.760
- Thank you.
- No reason.

53:46.920 --> 53:50.800
Thank you. Goodbye.

53:50.960 --> 53:53.040
Wait.

53:54.320 --> 53:58.600
- I have to take it. Pardon.
- Of course.

53:59.600 --> 54:02.720
- Where's your friend?
- He got a call.

54:02.880 --> 54:07.000
- Thank you for this wonderful evening.
- You too.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.520
- Here.
- My mother would give them to you.

54:12.680 --> 54:15.040
They belong with you.

54:15.200 --> 54:20.360
And if you end up in the same situation,
as I was in, remember your mother's advice.

54:21.400 --> 54:25.200
It is perhaps a little scary,
but it's worth the risk.

54:27.320 --> 54:32.480
It was great to meet you
in this unusual way.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.200
Thank you.

54:40.360 --> 54:46.440
Okay, I will. Yes. Goodbye.

54:48.840 --> 54:51.840
I'm sorry. It was my mother.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.400
She wants me to call, so she
know that I have made a good home.

54:59.040 --> 55:02.760
What's wrong?

55:02.920 --> 55:07.120
You are lucky that you have a mother,
who care about you.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.640
As you can call.

55:12.960 --> 55:15.080
I have never had.

55:17.840 --> 55:21.720
I'm sorry.
That I should not have said.

55:21.880 --> 55:25.560
I do not know
why I behave like this.

55:25.720 --> 55:30.040
Becoming upset weakens
one's judgment. It says my father.

55:30.200 --> 55:32.560
That's not true.

55:33.640 --> 55:37.880
And I do not think,
that your mother would have thought.

55:39.120 --> 55:41.600
What is it that happens to me?

55:44.640 --> 55:47.200
I do not know
what to believe anymore.

55:50.640 --> 55:53.720
Come here.

56:37.080 --> 56:39.080
Thank you.

56:41.120 --> 56:44.120
- How are you?
- Terrible.

56:44.280 --> 56:51.000
- And the writing?
- It is not good. I should give up.

56:51.160 --> 56:54.520
No. Do not give up.

56:55.840 --> 56:59.920
In addition, I like
new you.

57:03.840 --> 57:08.560
- For the chairs, I think...
- I have so much work.

57:08.720 --> 57:13.000
They are the last on the list.
We must end this.

57:13.160 --> 57:15.760
We have plenty of time before Friday.

57:15.920 --> 57:19.480
It's probably not a good idea
to postpone the writing.

57:19.640 --> 57:24.120
Is it important not
that you help me write?

57:26.320 --> 57:30.840
- Your mother's list is a part of this.
- No. I can not.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.320
I can not handle this right now.

57:33.480 --> 57:37.360
- Do not forget our bet.
- I do not care.

57:37.520 --> 57:40.920
- Darcy, listen to me.
- Nathan, this does not help.

57:41.080 --> 57:47.320
To feel all this helps you.
It is hard, but you must continue.

57:47.480 --> 57:51.000
Think of all the good
that has come out of it.

57:52.320 --> 57:57.640
To hear that my mother was a sweet person,
I will never get to know...

57:57.800 --> 58:00.080
I will not relive.

58:01.480 --> 58:07.120
I know that you do not have all the answers
why this happens.

58:07.280 --> 58:09.280
But if I am right -

58:09.440 --> 58:14.480
- And it turns out to be something that
can help you, then you will know it.

58:16.120 --> 58:19.240
Is not that reason enough
to complete this?

58:23.680 --> 58:28.320
- Where are we going?
- At the library.

58:28.480 --> 58:31.480
We need to look in local directories.

58:31.640 --> 58:36.720
- Maybe we can find Russ Hamilton?
- And an address.

58:36.880 --> 58:40.680
- It sounds unlikely.
- All the more reason to try.

58:47.200 --> 58:50.160
- Have you found anything?
- Not yet.

58:50.320 --> 58:53.600
This is a waste of time.

58:56.040 --> 58:59.200
Wait. R. Hamilton. He stands here.

58:59.360 --> 59:01.800
- When is it?
- 1985.

59:08.360 --> 59:11.680
- We're sorry. Your...
- number is not active.

59:11.840 --> 59:15.560
- But there is an address.
- Cypress Avenue 2110.

59:15.720 --> 59:18.920
It is near. Come on.

59:19.080 --> 59:21.680
- Nathan...
- Come on.

59:26.280 --> 59:30.520
- It's here. Are you ready?
- Let's get it over with.

59:43.280 --> 59:46.360
- My goodness.
- Beverly?

59:46.520 --> 59:49.280
- Darcy, right?
- Yes. Hello.

59:49.440 --> 59:52.880
- Do you two apart?
- We have encountered each other.

59:53.040 --> 59:55.280
- Nathan, this is Beverly.
- Hi.

59:55.440 --> 59:57.560
What are you doing here?

59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.400
We are looking for Russ Hamilton.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.800
Russ and his wife have not lived here
for many years.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:11.760
- Does he live still in the area?
- He has lived in Denver.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.880
Do you have his address?

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.560
I have an address,
but it is probably not an issue anymore.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:26.200
- We did not keep in touch.
- It's worth a try.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.400
- My goodness.
- What are the chances of this?

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.600
May I ask
what it is all about?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.160
It's hard to explain, but we
seeks out my mother's old friends.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.400
She died in a car accident
long ago.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.800
I'm sorry.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.560
She was killed by a drunk driver.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.360
How terrible.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.600
- When was that?
- I was a year, so it was in 1985.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.520
- What date?
- On 23 September.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.920
Beverly?

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.840
Beverly, are you okay?

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.640
This is my son.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.880
My only son.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.000
He loved football.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.920
He played in high school, but
stopped when he got to college.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.600
But he loved to watch the games.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.920
Our home team won
an important victory on a Saturday night.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.720
I think...

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.200
... That there was celebration
park.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.280
I said to him
hundreds of times -

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.520
- He must not drive a car,
when he had been drinking.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.240
As he was not home by midnight,
I knew...

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.840
I knew that something had happened.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:41.200
- Wait. What?
- My heart broke when police came.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.920
He had hit anyone.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.800
Ben. Ben Davis.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.120
It was called the man
that ran into my mother.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.480
It was my son. My child.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.240
Your mother was Marianne, right?

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.120
Darcy. Wait a minute.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.360
This can not be true.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.480
- This is insane.
- I know. It's incredible.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.320
Drop explanations.
This made everything worse.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.000
- I do not need your help.
- Darcy, wait.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.640
- Hey, Dad.
- Sorry, I did not call first.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.200
- Do you have a moment?
- Of course. Come in.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.480
Do you want tea or coffee?

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.360
Tea would be great.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.240
- How's the writing?
- Do not ask.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.760
Do you still work together
with his teacher?

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.880
No, it did not work.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.560
- But you should probably drop something?
- So do I.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.360
What are you talking about?

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.520
It's...

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.720
It's hard for me
to talk about your mother.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.520
I know. It was not
mean to make you sad.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.120
It's more than that.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:21.320
- Your mother took care of everyone.
- Yes, I've heard.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.880
She called me
many times a day.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:31.360
She said she was
and when she would come home.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:35.880
To be honest,
then drive me crazy.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:43.040
I said: "You do not
to tell me everything all the time."

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.920
"Do what you have to do,
and came home when you're done."

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.640
This is great, Dad.
You speak of her.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.240
That evening, the accident happened -

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:04.200
- She had sorted errands throughout
day and it was getting late.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.880
The phone rang.
I had just sat down.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.840
I had just put you to bed,
and I was completely exhausted.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.320
I knew why she called,
so I let it ring.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.520
I let it just rings.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.800
Since then I have not been able
help thinking:

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.680
- "Imagine if I had the answer."
- It was Mom.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.720
If only I had talked with her
-

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:43.400
- She would not have been
in the intersection at the time.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.320
- I was stupid.
- It was not your fault.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.640
- If I had the answer...
- You did nothing wrong.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.800
You used to always ask:
"Where is mother gone?"

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:11.520
I could not say...
that it was because of me.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.600
It was not your fault.
It will be OK.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.800
It's not your fault.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.240
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.640
I'm glad you called.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.040
It has been
some hard days, right?

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.960
I wanted to look for you
in the last few days.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.400
I did not know
if it was the right thing to do.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.840
Is there anything really to do
in a situation like this?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.880
I do not know.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:07.440
This is so weird
and incomprehensible.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.040
Think, our paths would meet.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.319
It almost feels,
as if something had brought us together.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:19.880
I do not know what to believe.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.560
I wish that
that everything could be done about.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.040
There is no excuse.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:31.920
I do not know what he was thinking. I
will apologize, but how do I do?

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.319
How do you do something good again,
that is so unforgivable?

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:43.920
I lost someone I never get
back. You did too.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.439
It was the hardest thing
I have ever experienced.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.200
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.

01:08:56.359 --> 01:09:00.359
How did you do it?
How did you get through it?

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.399
I do not know.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.560
When it feels as if everything falls over,
and there is no hope -

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:12.120
- Must get on their feet.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:16.840
One must continue
and move forward.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.760
- Even when you just want to give up?
- Especially since.

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:27.439
What do we do now?

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.520
We can try to help each other
to get through this.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.600
That sounds good.
But before I forget it...

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:43.200
I have found an old number
on mr. and mrs. Hamilton.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:47.760
I phoned around
and got hold of their number for you.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.920
- Thank you.
- No reason.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.440
You must come back.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.880
I think that you came into my life
for a special reason.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.480
- Will do.
- I hope so.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.400
It's Nathan. Leave a message,
I will call you back.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:37.360
Nathan, it's Darcy. I just want
say that I'm sorry -

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.440
- I said the other day.
I was sad.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:48.560
I would also like to say
that you really helped me.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.320
More than you know.
So call when you can.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.280
I can handle this.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.280
- Better.
- Do you mean that?

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.840
- "Dr. Darcy Miller" sounds pretty good.
- Thank you, dr. Reed.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.040
Let me know if I can help
with your job search.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.960
It's actually something
I want to talk to you about.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.080
Come, darling. We must go.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.920
- Aunt Kathy.
- You got a minute?

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.120
- Of course. What is it?
- Where are you?

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:49.800
- I have something I want to show you.
- What is it?

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.120
It is something that you will like.
Can you come over?

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.160
I'll be here shortly.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.960
See right here.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.880
It's Marianne's handwriting.
It is her old textbooks.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.320
- Where did you find them?
- In the garage.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.560
I was looking for a hammer
and found them in some old boxes.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.360
- This is an old college address.
- I found something more.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.920
- What could it be?
- Have no idea.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.520
I have no video player.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.160
Father still has a home.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.800
Did all this stuff in the garage?
How did that?

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:40.000
Perhaps it was mixed together
with Franks things. I do not know.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.920
Now we go downstairs.

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.360
There she is.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.560
It's time for breakfast.
Look at her.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.440
She was hungry this morning.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.200
How does it feel to be a mother?

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.960
It's hard to describe.
It is wonderful.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:18.600
It's everything I dreamed of,
and more.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.480
There's our daughter Darcy.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.600
- Say "hello", Darcy.
- Say hello".

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.040
"Hello, Dad. How are you?"

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.600
- Was not she good night?
- Yes, it was she.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.400
She fell asleep immediately.
Like his mother.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.080
What are you thinking, dear?

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.360
Many things. Everything
I want her to have.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.120
I hope she knows
that I will always be there for her.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.320
Darcy.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.200
I'm sorry. Dr. Miller Darcy.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.480
I love how it sounds.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.240
I knew you'd make it.
I am proud of you.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:30.120
- Thanks, Dad.
- Mother would have been proud.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.480
I know now.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.280
It feels as if she is with me.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.160
- What is it?
- You sound just like her.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.520
I love you, Dad.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.320
I love you, darling.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.640
- Well, what do you think?
- It looks good.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.200
One day we must fix the house.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.240
Is it really necessary?

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.120
It's as good as new.
It looks good, right?

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.760
Perfect timing. You know
what day it is today?

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.880
Your mother's birthday.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.280
Thank you took with me
here today.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.120
I'm glad
I finally did it.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.360
Nathan say that everything in life
occurs for some reason.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.240
What do you think about that?

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.920
I do not know. I'm not sure
that any of us know.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.200
Why do you ask?

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.720
I'm trying to understand -

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.400
- Why there has been so many
weird things lately.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:09.440
How everything that I have found
out of the mother helped me.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.320
What are you trying to say?

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:21.120
Perhaps it was no coincidence
I found mom's list.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.280
You know, all the textbooks,
as Aunt Kathy found?

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.800
There was an address in them.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.240
Perhaps it was
an old college address.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.360
Do you want to get there?

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.440
Why not?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.880
It's here. 2162nd

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.840
- Stayed mother here?
- Yes.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.800
It looks a little different,
but I can still recognize it.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:04.400
I know this house.
I have been here before.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.680
Hello.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.960
- You're here early.
- I could not wait.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.840
Thank you, because I had to get past
tonight.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.480
I'm sorry I did not call the
same. I had turned off the phone.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:44.600
After everything that has happened, I'd
be a little with my mother.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.800
I have not done enough
lately.

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.720
I'm really sorry.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.600
Everything happened so fast.
I could not handle it.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.040
I will not push you away.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.600
Do you think you can
get rid of me so easily?

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.600
I have a surprise for you.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.600
Join.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.480
- Did you do all this?
- Yes.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.840
Depending on the mother's list has contributed
to this magic.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.200
Along with little candles.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:44.000
Beverly found Russ Hamilton
number. I called him.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.680
He had borrowed the chairs for mom.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.960
He said that I should keep them
and use them for something good.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.040
I do not know what to say.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.680
Except... thanks.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.480
See right here.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:23.200
- Is this your mother?
- She stands in his garden.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:31.080
It is very similar to your garden.
Do not you think?

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.520
Wait. Do you think that...

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:47.320
Do you wonder how I
came in through your locked gate -

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.760
- So works Morse key still.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.280
- Can you believe this?
- I have no choice.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.080
- I love it here.
- I know.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.560
I have graduated now
thanks to you.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.440
- Have you delivered your presentation?
- Yes.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:12.360
I have to work with
dr. Reed. I am going to stay here.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.680
Is it true?

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.840
I'm glad to hear.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.720
Let's say that your theory voices.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.640
That everything in the universe happens
one reason or another.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.080
- So have all led me to you.
- Interesting.

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.640
- Why?
- I do not know. Whatever the reason -

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.600
- I'll start listening
to life's message to me.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.360
There must be
a more logical explanation.

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.720
A case
or perhaps statistical probability.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.600
It still applies. But maybe not
in all contexts.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.120
Does this
that I won the bet?

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:08.240
- I think we both won.
- Yes.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:41.520
