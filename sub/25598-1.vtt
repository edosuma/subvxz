WEBVTT

00:00.013 --> 00:01.264
<i>Previously, on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.288 --> 00:02.922
Which one of my clients
are you after?

00:02.924 --> 00:05.358
Because we both know
you can't have Pfizer.

00:05.360 --> 00:06.493
- Yes, I can.
- Then make me name partner.

00:06.495 --> 00:07.994
You don't just slap
somebody's name on the wall

00:07.996 --> 00:09.015
to get a client.

00:09.016 --> 00:10.864
I'm not just slapping
his name up, Louis.

00:10.866 --> 00:12.465
I'm making a move.

00:12.467 --> 00:14.133
I'm not saying Donna doesn't
deserve a promotion;

00:14.135 --> 00:16.703
I'm just saying making partner
means something.

00:16.705 --> 00:18.705
And I'm concerned that being
one here

00:18.707 --> 00:20.740
won't mean what it used to.

00:20.742 --> 00:22.208
This is an amazing amount
of work.

00:22.210 --> 00:23.910
I stayed up all night
doing it.

00:23.912 --> 00:25.645
But I thought you take the
night shift with your son.

00:25.647 --> 00:26.913
I told my wife she'd have
to take it last night.

00:26.915 --> 00:28.581
I thought you might
need a little relief.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.592
You sure?
Support his head.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.232
There we go.

00:32.234 --> 00:34.167
Holy shit. Gordon doesn't
really wanna take over.

00:34.169 --> 00:35.535
He just wants
to orchestrate a deal

00:35.537 --> 00:36.803
where his guys come back,

00:36.805 --> 00:38.205
they vote to merge with Zane,

00:38.207 --> 00:39.740
and we cease to exist.

00:39.742 --> 00:41.008
I just found out
that my two partners

00:41.010 --> 00:43.164
are willing to stab me
in the back.

00:43.165 --> 00:45.098
God damn it, Louis.
I'm trying the best I can.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.689
Well, then,
try something else,

00:46.690 --> 00:48.720
because giving you the reins
a half hour

00:48.721 --> 00:50.187
before we drive off
a cliff

00:50.189 --> 00:52.056
isn't gonna do shit.

00:52.058 --> 00:54.992
I just came to make sure that
the paperwork was in order

00:54.994 --> 00:57.161
for your clients to come over
and join our new firm.

00:57.163 --> 00:59.163
I went and saw Andy Forsyth
today.

00:59.165 --> 01:01.632
You went to see him about us
moving to Seattle?

01:01.634 --> 01:03.401
If we're ever gonna do

01:03.403 --> 01:04.802
something like this in our
lives, now is the time.

01:04.804 --> 01:06.370
And what about the wedding?

01:06.372 --> 01:07.505
We could move it up.

01:07.507 --> 01:09.307
If I've learned one thing,

01:09.309 --> 01:10.741
it's that there is nothing
that I can't handle

01:10.743 --> 01:12.443
when I have you by my side.

01:12.445 --> 01:14.245
You're the husband I've
always wanted.

01:14.247 --> 01:16.647
And I can't wait to begin our
adventure together.

01:18.117 --> 01:19.150
Rachel and I were offered a
chance

01:19.152 --> 01:20.785
to run a firm in
Seattle.

01:20.787 --> 01:22.353
- Mike--
- Harvey,

01:22.355 --> 01:23.621
this is who I am.
It's who I've always been.

01:23.623 --> 01:25.423
It's time, Harvey.

01:31.464 --> 01:33.130
I'll tell you what, Robert.

01:33.430 --> 01:34.954
Your baby girl
just got married,

01:34.955 --> 01:36.354
I'm gonna throw you a bone.

01:36.356 --> 01:37.989
Your name goes first.

01:37.991 --> 01:39.691
No. No.

01:39.693 --> 01:41.334
You think I don't know
what you're doing.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.669
Then I owe you.
Yours goes first.

01:43.671 --> 01:44.937
You saying I owe you?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.939
You do owe me.
I saved your ass.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.640
Well, you only did
that because we put you

01:48.642 --> 01:49.808
in a terrible position.

01:50.168 --> 01:52.568
Wait.
That's against me.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.238
Jesus Christ,
what have I got myself into?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.873
I'll tell you what.

01:56.875 --> 01:58.541
You got yourself
into Zane Specter Litt.

01:58.543 --> 02:01.144
Or Specter Zane Litt.

02:01.146 --> 02:03.780
Either way...

02:03.782 --> 02:07.083
Litt comes last.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.523
Hey.

02:13.525 --> 02:15.124
Wanna go out and get a burger?

02:15.126 --> 02:16.959
I do.
But it's 2:00 a.m.

02:16.961 --> 02:18.528
If I go out for
a burger right now,

02:18.530 --> 02:20.029
the only thing
I'm getting is a divorce.

02:20.031 --> 02:22.332
Copy that. I'll get you
one from the kitchen.

02:22.334 --> 02:23.700
Yeah, meet me downstairs.

02:23.702 --> 02:25.301
Hide it in the gift bag
or some shit.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.167 --> 03:04.500
- You're here early.
- I am.

03:04.502 --> 03:06.932
I know this is about the time
you finish your morning run.

03:06.933 --> 03:08.365
Look, Harvey.
If this is about me

03:08.367 --> 03:10.000
getting into it with Louis
while you were gone--

03:10.002 --> 03:11.602
It isn't. I didn't even know
that happened.

03:11.604 --> 03:13.838
Well, you might as well
hear about it now.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.573
I came to him with an idea
to save the firm

03:15.575 --> 03:17.827
that involved making me
temporary managing partner

03:17.828 --> 03:19.595
and he bit my head off.

03:19.597 --> 03:21.263
Let me guess, he thought
you were coming after me.

03:21.265 --> 03:23.065
Harvey, I would never
do that to you.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.733
I know that, but that's not
what I'm here to talk about.

03:24.735 --> 03:27.703
I'm here to tell you
that as of this morning

03:27.705 --> 03:29.371
we're merging with Robert Zane.

03:29.373 --> 03:31.001
- What?
- Alex.

03:31.025 --> 03:32.475
I don't believe it.

03:32.476 --> 03:34.109
When I came over
you said my name

03:34.111 --> 03:35.344
would be the one to go up next.

03:35.346 --> 03:36.512
I know that,
but this was

03:36.514 --> 03:38.313
the only way
to save the firm.

03:38.315 --> 03:40.048
And you know
as well as I do,

03:40.050 --> 03:41.450
Zane has been
a name partner

03:41.452 --> 03:43.418
longer than me and Louis
combined.

03:43.420 --> 03:45.888
All right,
I get it.

03:45.890 --> 03:47.422
But we had an agreement.

03:47.424 --> 03:49.691
And I want your word right now
that you're gonna honor it.

03:49.693 --> 03:52.794
You have my word.
Your name goes up next.

03:54.703 --> 03:56.569
All right.

03:56.571 --> 03:58.471
One more thing.

03:58.473 --> 04:01.041
Did Louis know about
the merger before this morning?

04:01.043 --> 04:02.308
Yeah, why?

04:02.310 --> 04:03.576
Because if he didn't tell
me about it,

04:03.578 --> 04:05.412
he must really not trust me.

04:05.414 --> 04:08.148
Which means when it is time to
put my name up there--

04:08.150 --> 04:10.116
- Louis'll be fine, Alex.
- And what if he's not?

04:10.118 --> 04:11.985
Like I said,
you have my word.

04:18.994 --> 04:20.694
Of course I would
do that for you.

04:20.696 --> 04:22.762
I would do anything for you
because I love you.

04:22.764 --> 04:24.631
I promise.
I will never bring it up again.

04:24.633 --> 04:26.666
We never have
to get a Maine Coon.

04:28.103 --> 04:29.869
- Sheila?
- Yes.

04:29.871 --> 04:32.005
Anyway, I brought you in
because I want--

04:32.007 --> 04:33.807
Katrina, what's on your mind?

04:33.809 --> 04:37.510
Nothing.
It's just, giving up cats?

04:38.067 --> 04:40.268
Louis, after all she put
you through, are you sure?

04:40.270 --> 04:41.535
I am.
And besides,

04:41.537 --> 04:43.271
she's still open
to getting a short hair.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.274
- Well, then I'm happy for you.
- And I'm happy for you, too,

04:46.276 --> 04:48.009
because today is the day
that you get to make

04:48.011 --> 04:49.343
your two greatest loves
more efficient.

04:49.345 --> 04:51.212
Don't tell me.
We're merging with Zane;

04:51.214 --> 04:52.313
we have more associates
than we can handle;

04:52.315 --> 04:54.292
and you need
the one person

04:54.293 --> 04:56.627
who worked at both firms
to cull that herd.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.362
Exactly.
And now I need you to come up

04:58.364 --> 05:00.163
with a list of the ten
least-efficient associates

05:00.165 --> 05:01.899
without telling me names
or whether or not

05:01.901 --> 05:03.100
they come from Zane or us.

05:03.102 --> 05:04.668
Got it.

05:04.824 --> 05:06.924
And, Katrina?

05:06.926 --> 05:09.427
Thanks for your concern
about Sheila and me.

05:09.429 --> 05:11.262
Louis, you know I care
for you

05:11.264 --> 05:13.297
deeply in
a completely asexual manner.

05:13.299 --> 05:14.832
And I too care
for you deeply

05:14.834 --> 05:17.802
and see you neither
as man nor woman.

05:17.804 --> 05:19.670
Thank you, Louis.

05:19.672 --> 05:21.138
Kinder words were never spoken.

05:21.140 --> 05:23.340
I'll have my list for you
by the end of the day.

05:31.984 --> 05:33.818
I'm gonna miss her too.

05:34.518 --> 05:36.384
I'm not sure which is worse.

05:36.386 --> 05:37.719
Finding out Mike was a fraud

05:37.721 --> 05:40.021
or that he's taking
my daughter away.

05:41.324 --> 05:43.625
Pretty sure it was
the fraud thing.

05:43.627 --> 05:45.393
You probably got a point.

05:45.395 --> 05:48.163
Speaking of frauds
and your daughter.

05:55.867 --> 05:57.600
She left that for me?

05:57.602 --> 06:00.036
A little welcome to the firm
from your little girl.

06:01.773 --> 06:02.972
By the way,
Harvey wants to meet

06:02.974 --> 06:04.307
at 9:30 in the conference room.

06:04.309 --> 06:06.009
So in the meantime,
why don't you

06:06.011 --> 06:07.810
set yourself up
in Mike's old office.

06:08.246 --> 06:09.479
Thank you, Donna.

06:09.481 --> 06:10.847
It's nice to have you here,
Robert.

06:10.849 --> 06:13.216
Oh, we'll see how nice
it is once I tell Harvey

06:13.218 --> 06:15.818
it's not his old office
that I'm looking to be in.

06:15.820 --> 06:18.388
Claiming managing partner
already.

06:18.390 --> 06:19.822
Isn't that a bold statement
for day one?

06:19.824 --> 06:21.524
Let me tell you something,
Red.

06:21.526 --> 06:23.993
I've been making bold
statements my entire career.

06:23.995 --> 06:26.396
I'm sure as hell not
about to stop now.

extra managing partner

07:07.914 --> 07:09.513
isn't something
we're gonna decide overnight.

07:09.515 --> 07:11.782
Therefore,
for the sake of firm harmony,

07:11.784 --> 07:13.951
I suggest we start
with conflicts of interest.

07:13.953 --> 07:15.786
- Fine with me.
- Me too.

07:15.788 --> 07:17.722
Great.
As you can see,

07:17.724 --> 07:20.658
I've taken
the liberty of suggesting

07:20.660 --> 07:22.360
who drops which client.

07:22.362 --> 07:25.196
And I am confident you'll agree
with all of my proposals

07:25.198 --> 07:27.498
with the exception--
- I'm not dropping Dexterol.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.833
And I'm not
dropping Clavatin.

07:28.835 --> 07:30.368
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

07:30.370 --> 07:31.702
What do you mean,
"Exactly what?"

07:31.704 --> 07:33.471
I knew that neither of you
would be willing

07:33.473 --> 07:35.973
to give up those particular
clients. Exactly that.

07:36.494 --> 07:38.494
You mean you don't have
a suggestion?

07:38.496 --> 07:39.796
I have a suggestion.

07:39.798 --> 07:41.097
You drop yours,
then the next time

07:41.099 --> 07:42.965
we have a major conflict
I'll drop mine.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.801
You sure about that?
Because the next major conflict

07:44.803 --> 07:46.736
we're gonna have is
who's managing partner.

07:46.738 --> 07:48.337
Then what exactly
is your idea?

07:48.339 --> 07:49.772
I say whoever's
client billed

07:49.774 --> 07:51.274
the most hours
last year stays.

07:51.276 --> 07:52.575
Well, that's pretty damn
convenient

07:52.577 --> 07:54.911
because your client went
through a merger

07:54.913 --> 07:56.445
so their billables
are inflated.

07:56.447 --> 07:58.114
You're saying
that the sun got in your eyes

07:58.116 --> 07:59.348
and that's why you dropped
the big pass?

07:59.350 --> 08:00.750
Wait a second,
Harvey's right.

08:00.752 --> 08:02.351
- Come again?
- No, not about who to drop.

08:02.353 --> 08:04.153
Your client did just
go through a merger.

08:04.155 --> 08:05.755
They're in a whole new
line of business.

08:06.104 --> 08:09.338
Most of which doesn't conflict
with Clavatin anymore.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.740
Where you going with this?

08:10.742 --> 08:12.308
I'm saying if we can get
either client

08:12.310 --> 08:14.377
to drop the one division
where they still overlap

08:14.379 --> 08:16.479
you can keep them both.

08:17.549 --> 08:20.449
Well, in that case
I'll get my client to drop.

08:20.451 --> 08:21.817
It's the least I can do.

08:21.819 --> 08:23.553
Oh, no.
I'll do the honors.

08:23.555 --> 08:25.454
After all, you welcomed me
into your home.

08:25.456 --> 08:27.390
Why don't we make it
a friendly wager.

08:27.392 --> 08:28.991
We each get our client
to drop.

08:28.993 --> 08:30.393
First one who gets there wins.

08:30.395 --> 08:32.361
Sure thing.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.389
Don't do it.

08:46.358 --> 08:48.292
Don't do what?

08:48.294 --> 08:50.527
Don't try to get Zane's
client to dump their division

08:50.529 --> 08:52.462
after telling him you'd get
your client to do it.

08:52.464 --> 08:53.730
How do you even know
that's what happened?

08:53.732 --> 08:55.299
I know because Louis told me.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.633
What do you mean
Louis told you?

08:56.635 --> 08:58.202
The meeting just ended two
seconds ago

08:58.204 --> 08:59.436
and I came right back here.

08:59.438 --> 09:01.271
In that case,
I mean,

09:01.273 --> 09:03.207
I heard Louis' voice
on the recording device

09:03.209 --> 09:04.708
that I had installed
in the conference room.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.210
You bugged the meeting?

09:06.212 --> 09:07.544
Bugged is such
a distasteful word.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.413
- That's not an answer.
- Okay.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.348
You want an answer?

09:11.350 --> 09:13.910
I have been listening
to your conversations

09:13.911 --> 09:16.044
since you were an associate
and I'm not about to stop now.

09:16.046 --> 09:17.412
Now, do you want to quibble
about my methods

09:17.414 --> 09:18.647
or do you want
to get the part

09:18.649 --> 09:19.815
where I save you
from yourself?

09:19.817 --> 09:21.450
- Donna.
- Harvey, you heard him.

09:21.452 --> 09:23.285
Zane's got his eye on
managing partner.

09:23.287 --> 09:24.820
I know good
and well what he's after.

09:24.822 --> 09:26.555
Then why would you give
him ammunition?

09:27.691 --> 09:29.658
Because you think
this is gonna be fun.

09:29.660 --> 09:31.393
But trust me,
you go after him

09:31.395 --> 09:33.261
and it's gonna get more serious
than you thought.

09:33.263 --> 09:34.863
And in the end,
you're just gonna prove

09:34.865 --> 09:37.566
that he's better suited
to be in your office than you.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.325
Okay, Donna.

09:42.927 --> 09:45.261
Okay, you're not gonna pick
a fight with Robert Zane?

09:45.263 --> 09:48.197
No. Okay, I'm gonna find
someone else to do it for me.

09:55.974 --> 09:57.540
Twice in one day.

09:57.542 --> 09:58.941
To what do I owe
the pleasure now?

09:58.943 --> 10:00.576
I'm here to tell you,
you want your name

10:00.578 --> 10:01.777
on the door you got to earn it.

10:01.779 --> 10:03.079
I thought I already had.

10:03.081 --> 10:04.680
Maybe you have,
maybe you haven't,

10:04.682 --> 10:05.748
but I got something for you
to do anyway.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.450
And what exactly is that?

10:07.452 --> 10:09.352
I need you to get
Robert Zane's biggest client

10:09.354 --> 10:11.287
to sell
their manufacturing division.

10:11.756 --> 10:13.823
Harvey,
you point me up the hill,

10:13.825 --> 10:15.324
I'm gonna kill whoever's
at the top.

10:15.326 --> 10:17.126
- But?
- But in this case,

10:17.128 --> 10:18.427
the guy at
the top is on our side.

10:18.429 --> 10:20.163
- Is he?
- What are you talking about?

10:20.165 --> 10:22.330
I'm telling you
this is gonna determine

10:22.331 --> 10:23.664
who runs the firm.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.032
Zane knows it and I know it.

10:25.034 --> 10:26.867
So if you want me
to be able to live up

10:26.869 --> 10:29.603
to that promise,
I need you to do this.

10:29.605 --> 10:30.971
And I don't like
being threatened

10:30.973 --> 10:32.673
for you to uphold
a promise you already made.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.108
I don't either,
but like it or not,

10:34.110 --> 10:36.377
this benefits both of us.

10:36.379 --> 10:38.125
And I guarantee you right now,
Zane's going to

10:38.126 --> 10:40.159
his right-hand man
to ask the same thing.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.694
And who is his right hand?

10:41.696 --> 10:43.863
Your job isn't
to ask who he is.

10:43.865 --> 10:46.065
Your job is to kick his ass.

11:15.746 --> 11:16.845
You planning
on making it in

11:16.847 --> 11:18.981
to the new offices
anytime soon?

11:18.983 --> 11:20.749
What for?
Help you pick out new lamps?

11:20.751 --> 11:22.084
What's that supposed to mean?

11:22.086 --> 11:23.919
It means I knew
you'd come in here

11:23.921 --> 11:25.754
and ask me to take care of
whatever needs taking care of

11:25.756 --> 11:27.489
whenever it needs
taking care of.

11:27.491 --> 11:29.424
So unless you want to step in
and take a beating,

11:29.426 --> 11:30.826
why don't you just get to it?

11:30.828 --> 11:32.361
You think I couldn't
handle you?

11:32.363 --> 11:33.362
I think
if you took your tie off,

11:33.364 --> 11:35.263
we could find out.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.346
Shit, I come up there
and get my ass kicked

11:37.348 --> 11:39.314
by a skinny white girl, my life
would never be the same.

11:39.316 --> 11:41.650
So what do we got?
A number two, a number six?

11:41.652 --> 11:43.618
Number 14 with a side of 11.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.087
Well, leave the file
and the particulars,

11:45.089 --> 11:47.189
I'll get to it when I'm done.
- Samantha.

11:47.191 --> 11:49.124
I need you to come
through for me on this one.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.792
Come on, Robert, have I
ever let you down before?

11:50.794 --> 11:51.994
You've never lost,

11:51.996 --> 11:54.563
but you have let me down
a time or two.

11:54.565 --> 11:56.365
Well, then, I give you
my word this will not

11:56.367 --> 11:58.633
be one of those times.

12:04.108 --> 12:06.375
Damn, could kick my ass.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.387
Katrina,
what are you doing here?

12:17.389 --> 12:18.655
I gave you an assignment--
I finished it.

12:18.657 --> 12:19.890
What do you mean
you finished it?

12:19.892 --> 12:21.558
I asked you to evaluate
50 associates.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.826
How could you have done
that already?

12:22.828 --> 12:24.361
I didn't.
PATTIE did it for me.

12:24.363 --> 12:26.263
- Who the hell's Pattie?
- Not who, what.

12:26.265 --> 12:27.631
Personal
Assessment Tallying

12:27.633 --> 12:29.132
and Totalling Individual
Efficiency.

12:29.134 --> 12:29.944
Say what now?

12:29.945 --> 12:32.387
I plugged in 16 parameters
and quantifiables,

12:32.388 --> 12:33.754
PATTIE popped out a list

12:33.756 --> 12:34.955
ranking the associates
from 1 to 50.

12:34.957 --> 12:36.323
Katrina, this is amazing.

12:36.325 --> 12:37.891
Not only that,
it's completely objective.

12:37.893 --> 12:39.960
The bottom ten are
the least efficient, period.

12:39.962 --> 12:41.929
Well, then I guess
all that's left is for you

12:41.931 --> 12:43.063
to tell me who they are
and for me to let them go.

12:43.065 --> 12:44.498
About that, Louis.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.166
I'd like to be the one
to do the letting go.

12:46.168 --> 12:48.202
Katrina, I could never ask
you to do that.

12:48.204 --> 12:49.937
You're not asking;
I am.

12:49.939 --> 12:51.772
I don't understand.
Why would you want to?

12:51.774 --> 12:53.740
Louis, you told me I could be
senior partner one day.

12:53.742 --> 12:55.976
Which means, I need to be able
to do things like this.

12:55.978 --> 12:57.945
- But--
- And as Ned Stark would say,

12:57.947 --> 13:00.247
"He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword."

13:00.249 --> 13:02.049
You know I can never argue
with Ned Stark.

13:02.051 --> 13:03.717
I do.

13:03.719 --> 13:06.053
Thank you.

13:06.055 --> 13:07.788
Katrina.

13:08.858 --> 13:11.758
Make them clean deaths.
- I will.

13:22.538 --> 13:24.304
Jeremy Stiller.

13:24.982 --> 13:27.016
- Who are you?
- I work for Robert Zane.

13:27.018 --> 13:29.118
Ah. Well, I'm sorry
Ms. Works for Robert Zane,

13:29.120 --> 13:30.419
but this is private property.

13:30.421 --> 13:31.987
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

13:31.989 --> 13:34.123
I have to say,
it almost feels like you knew

13:34.125 --> 13:35.524
this encounter would happen.

13:35.526 --> 13:37.293
That's because
Alex Williams told me

13:37.295 --> 13:39.061
a man named Sam Wheeler
would be coming.

13:39.063 --> 13:40.896
Which means he was
resourceful enough

13:40.898 --> 13:42.464
to find out my name but
didn't have enough imagination

13:42.466 --> 13:43.933
to think I might be a woman.

13:43.935 --> 13:45.067
Well,
he had enough imagination

13:45.069 --> 13:46.669
to tell me not
to take your call.

13:46.671 --> 13:47.970
And he only did that
because he's afraid

13:47.972 --> 13:49.171
you might like
what I have to say.

13:49.173 --> 13:51.073
Well, I don't.
Even if I did,

13:51.075 --> 13:52.241
I'm loyal to Specter Litt.

13:52.243 --> 13:53.876
Look, I'm sorry.

13:53.878 --> 13:55.211
Clearly we got off
on the wrong foot, but I--

13:55.213 --> 13:56.612
We did.
Now if you don't mind,

13:56.614 --> 13:58.547
I have work to do.

14:02.564 --> 14:04.264
I grew up poor.

14:04.266 --> 14:05.999
We lived on a farm
and my only chance

14:06.001 --> 14:07.701
of going to college
was to get a scholarship,

14:07.703 --> 14:09.703
which I did.

14:09.705 --> 14:12.472
Sophomore year, the company
that funded my scholarship

14:12.474 --> 14:14.207
went out of business.

14:14.209 --> 14:16.142
So I had a choice.

14:16.144 --> 14:19.045
Do it myself,
or don't do it at all.

14:20.249 --> 14:23.884
Since then,
I have scratched and clawed

14:23.886 --> 14:26.853
for everything I have ever had.

14:26.855 --> 14:28.255
Why are you telling me this?

14:28.257 --> 14:29.789
Because the details
were different

14:29.791 --> 14:32.058
but I know the same thing
happened to you.

14:33.929 --> 14:35.762
Please.

14:35.764 --> 14:38.365
All I'm asking
is for you to hear me out.

14:41.003 --> 14:42.636
Okay, I'll hear you out.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.166
But there's no way
I'm dropping my business.

14:49.106 --> 14:50.405
Donna, do you have a minute?

14:50.407 --> 14:51.906
Does this have to do
with the associates

14:51.908 --> 14:53.275
we're letting go?
- It does.

14:53.277 --> 14:54.643
And since I understand
you'll be doing

14:54.645 --> 14:55.944
exit interviews with them,

14:55.946 --> 14:58.280
I thought you should know
who's going.

14:58.282 --> 14:59.948
That's funny.

14:59.950 --> 15:01.583
That's not what I thought
you'd be asking.

15:01.585 --> 15:03.051
What do you mean?

15:03.053 --> 15:04.953
Katrina, are you sure you're
going to be okay

15:04.955 --> 15:07.222
firing people you've worked
with for years?

15:07.224 --> 15:09.190
I mean, I know you value
you the firm, but this--

15:09.192 --> 15:11.026
I know it isn't going
to be easy, Donna.

15:11.454 --> 15:13.480
I was once let go
from here too,

15:13.481 --> 15:15.739
but I'll tell you
what I told Louis.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.540
That if I'm going
to grow in my role here

15:17.542 --> 15:19.408
this is something I'm going
to have to learn to do.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.744
Fair enough.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.413
Hang on a second,
has Louis seen this list?

15:24.415 --> 15:25.948
No, why?

15:25.950 --> 15:27.283
There's a problem with
the first name.

15:27.285 --> 15:29.085
He's not gonna like it.
- I know that.

15:29.087 --> 15:30.886
Then I suggest
you let him know

15:30.888 --> 15:32.054
before you pull the trigger.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.256
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

15:34.258 --> 15:36.759
Because this process
is supposed to be impartial.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.394
And if I tell Louis
who I'm going to fire

15:38.396 --> 15:40.363
just because he won't like
one of the names on the list--

15:40.365 --> 15:42.331
What won't I like?

15:44.235 --> 15:46.902
Louis, Katrina was
just informing me

15:46.904 --> 15:48.419
that it's not
a good idea for you--

15:48.420 --> 15:50.253
What name?

15:50.656 --> 15:52.089
- Brian.
- Nope.

15:52.091 --> 15:53.256
- Louis.
- Donna, this is between

15:53.258 --> 15:54.358
Katrina and me.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.559
No, Louis, it isn't.

15:55.561 --> 15:57.794
This is about the firm
and its integrity.

15:57.796 --> 15:59.529
You asked me to come up with
an objective metric

15:59.531 --> 16:02.032
and by that metric,
Brian Altman has to go.

16:02.034 --> 16:03.834
- So change the metric.
- I can't do that.

16:03.836 --> 16:05.202
And even if I could
he'd be just as likely

16:05.204 --> 16:06.803
to go down as go up.

16:06.805 --> 16:08.311
I understand that,
but I don't give a shit.

16:08.312 --> 16:09.345
Anyone but Brian.
- Louis--

16:09.347 --> 16:10.579
Katrina, listen to me.

16:10.581 --> 16:12.181
You asked for this
responsibility

16:12.183 --> 16:13.983
so I gave it to you.
So now I am telling you

16:13.985 --> 16:16.018
to find a way to keep him.

16:17.221 --> 16:19.955
Okay, Louis.
I'll see what I can do.

16:26.783 --> 16:28.316
Harvey, we need to talk.

16:28.318 --> 16:29.451
Don't tell me,
there's a problem.

16:29.453 --> 16:30.719
- There is.
- What is it now?

16:30.721 --> 16:32.454
It's not
that big of a deal,

16:32.456 --> 16:33.755
but you're gonna have
to figure out what font to use

16:33.757 --> 16:35.357
to put my name
on the letterhead.

16:35.359 --> 16:37.425
Because as of 2:00 p.m. today,
Robert Zane's client

16:37.427 --> 16:39.361
is officially dropping their
manufacturing division.

16:39.363 --> 16:40.662
You telling me you did it?

16:40.664 --> 16:42.163
Signed, sealed,
and delivered, my man.

16:42.165 --> 16:43.498
Now let's get down
to figuring out--

16:43.500 --> 16:46.301
What?
How to counter my last move?

16:46.303 --> 16:48.069
Because you may have
them signed and sealed

16:48.071 --> 16:49.471
but I'm here to tell you
your delivery

16:49.473 --> 16:51.206
got lost on the way.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.375
- Who the hell are you?
- Her name is Sam Wheeler.

16:53.377 --> 16:55.230
Truth be told, Alex,
I prefer Samantha.

16:55.326 --> 16:56.692
You two know each other?

16:56.694 --> 16:58.394
No, but it doesn't
take a genius to figure

16:58.396 --> 16:59.929
out she's Zane's guy.
- He didn't figure it out.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.398
What I figured out is,
whoever you are,

17:02.400 --> 17:04.133
if you think you can waltz
into my office--

17:04.135 --> 17:05.568
- Harvey, I got it.
- Do you?

17:05.569 --> 17:07.737
Because unless
I'm misreading the situation,

17:07.739 --> 17:09.637
she's saying you don't.
- Harvey.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.441
You know what, you two are
obviously having some trouble.

17:12.443 --> 17:14.242
The good news is
you'll have plenty of time

17:14.244 --> 17:17.012
to work it out because
as of end of business today,

17:17.013 --> 17:20.049
your client is dropping
their manufacturing division.

17:20.050 --> 17:21.550
And we can get back
to the business of running

17:21.551 --> 17:24.353
this firm under
the direction of Robert Zane.

17:24.355 --> 17:27.556
You two have a nice--
You know I don't mean it.

17:31.421 --> 17:32.987
No.

17:32.989 --> 17:34.956
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean this is my fight.

17:34.958 --> 17:37.158
You asked me to fight it,
and I'm not gonna

17:37.160 --> 17:38.493
let you step into
the middle of round two.

17:38.495 --> 17:40.128
It may be
the middle of round two,

17:40.130 --> 17:42.263
but you just told me you got
a first round knock-out.

17:42.265 --> 17:44.332
Well, I was wrong.
But I'm still in the ring,

17:44.334 --> 17:46.134
my partnership's on the line,
and I'm not getting out.

17:46.136 --> 17:49.137
- Then you better win.
- Where you going?

17:49.139 --> 17:52.240
To pick a fight
in my own weight class.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.242
Robert, how are you?
Settling in all right?

17:59.244 --> 18:01.211
Doing just fine,
thanks for asking.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.579
What can I do for you?

18:02.581 --> 18:04.348
I just dropped by
to tell you I had

18:04.350 --> 18:06.216
an interesting conversation
with your girl, Sam.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.619
She's kicking
your ass, isn't she?

18:08.621 --> 18:10.253
Not mine.
Since neither of you

18:10.255 --> 18:11.588
had the balls to invite
me into the ring.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.357
Just like you
didn't invite me.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.871
And don't give me any of this
nonsense about we had a deal.

18:15.872 --> 18:17.638
Because you broke it
just as fast as I did.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.373
I did,
but my issue isn't

18:19.375 --> 18:20.842
that she's fighting
your battles for you.

18:20.844 --> 18:22.510
It's that she walked
into my office like

18:22.512 --> 18:24.612
I wasn't the managing partner
of this firm.

18:24.614 --> 18:26.280
And I didn't like
the way she introduced herself

18:26.282 --> 18:27.582
to me either.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.517
But that's not
what your issue is.

18:29.519 --> 18:31.018
You're pissed.

18:31.020 --> 18:33.254
Because I didn't get in
the ring myself.

18:33.256 --> 18:35.122
Because if I'm not in there,
you're not in there.

18:35.124 --> 18:37.091
And you can't stand not
being in there.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.093
Are you saying
I always have to shoot?

18:39.095 --> 18:40.595
Because I'm fine
passing the ball.

18:40.597 --> 18:42.130
I'm talking about
being a coach.

18:42.132 --> 18:44.165
And if you were one,
you wouldn't mind

18:44.167 --> 18:46.000
just sitting back and watching
Samantha Wheeler

18:46.002 --> 18:47.402
eat your boy for breakfast.

18:47.404 --> 18:48.569
And if you think
that's gonna happen,

18:48.571 --> 18:50.171
you don't know Alex Williams.

18:50.173 --> 18:52.173
Oh, I know that's what's
gonna happen.

18:52.175 --> 18:54.509
And the person you don't know
is Harvey Specter.

18:54.511 --> 18:56.010
I know myself just fine.

18:56.012 --> 18:57.779
Then tell me you'll stay
the hell out of this.

18:57.781 --> 19:00.678
No problem, I just gave
Alex my word I'd stay out.

19:00.679 --> 19:02.412
And what kind of
managing partner would I be

19:02.414 --> 19:03.613
if I couldn't live up
to my word.

19:03.615 --> 19:05.348
Because,
just so we're clear, Robert,

19:05.350 --> 19:07.584
I am managing partner.
- Whatever you say, Harvey.

19:07.586 --> 19:09.615
But remember,
you didn't only

19:09.616 --> 19:11.649
give your word
to Alex Williams anymore.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.252
You just gave your word to me.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.701
And the next thing I knew...

19:24.006 --> 19:25.906
There were peas everywhere!

19:25.908 --> 19:30.110
On me, on the wall,
everywhere but in his mouth.

19:30.112 --> 19:32.746
I'm telling you, it was--
- Disgusting.

19:33.816 --> 19:35.883
I was gonna say adorable,
but...

19:37.386 --> 19:38.953
Anyway, this is nice.

19:38.955 --> 19:40.888
Katrina, I'm glad
you suggested lunch.

19:40.890 --> 19:43.457
So tell me, Brian.

19:43.459 --> 19:45.526
Do you think
that having a baby

19:45.528 --> 19:47.261
has made you more productive
in the workplace?

19:47.263 --> 19:49.363
- Are you kidding me?
- I see.

19:49.365 --> 19:51.298
Then what about
your efficiency?

19:51.300 --> 19:53.701
I understand children
sometimes necessitate

19:53.703 --> 19:55.536
better time management skills.

19:55.537 --> 19:57.137
For my wife, maybe.
But to tell you the truth,

19:57.139 --> 19:58.639
I'm all over the place.

19:58.641 --> 19:59.773
Then what would
you say

19:59.775 --> 20:01.541
are the areas
where you do excel?

20:01.543 --> 20:04.411
- With my son?
- No, Brian. At work.

20:05.214 --> 20:06.580
Oh, my God.
Am I getting fired?

20:06.582 --> 20:08.315
What?
No.

20:08.317 --> 20:10.117
We were just talking
about babies,

20:10.119 --> 20:11.385
and it got me thinking--

20:11.387 --> 20:13.320
About my time management
skills?

20:13.742 --> 20:15.742
Katrina, don't lie to me.
I've heard the rumors.

20:15.744 --> 20:18.378
Am I one of the ones
being let go from the merger?

20:18.380 --> 20:21.114
You heard right, Brian.
We are making some cuts.

20:21.116 --> 20:23.149
But you should know
the decisions were based

20:23.151 --> 20:25.051
on completely objective data.

20:25.053 --> 20:26.286
Completely objective?

20:26.288 --> 20:27.687
I work my ass off
for this firm.

20:27.689 --> 20:29.534
Well, your numbers certainly
don't show that.

20:29.535 --> 20:31.168
- My numbers?
- Yes, your numbers.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.669
The thing that indicates
how hard you work.

20:32.671 --> 20:34.404
I don't believe this.

20:34.406 --> 20:36.373
You know what, maybe people
were right about you.

20:36.733 --> 20:37.966
What does that mean?

20:37.968 --> 20:39.500
It means they say
you're cold

20:39.502 --> 20:41.336
and all you care about
is your job.

20:41.338 --> 20:43.838
Well, maybe they're right.
Maybe you are a robot.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.473
How dare you say that to me.

20:45.475 --> 20:47.241
How dare I say that to you?

20:47.243 --> 20:49.344
I've been showing you pictures
of my child

20:49.346 --> 20:51.512
and the whole time you've just
been waiting to fire me.

20:51.514 --> 20:53.114
What kind of person
would do that?

20:53.116 --> 20:55.383
You know what,
the kind of person

20:55.385 --> 20:59.087
who's been trying to figure out
how to save your job.

20:59.472 --> 21:01.605
But I haven't heard one thing
that I can use

21:01.607 --> 21:03.273
to justify keeping you.

21:03.275 --> 21:06.610
So as far as I'm concerned,
you're fired.

21:13.088 --> 21:14.788
Louis,
Can I talk to you for second?

21:15.321 --> 21:16.587
Course, what do you need?

21:16.589 --> 21:17.821
I have something I want
to run by you.

21:17.823 --> 21:18.822
I need to know if you think
it'll work.

21:18.824 --> 21:20.391
What's going on?

21:20.393 --> 21:21.525
Harvey's trying
to get Zane's client

21:21.527 --> 21:22.660
to drop their division,
not ours.

21:22.662 --> 21:24.228
And Zane's doing
the same thing.

21:24.230 --> 21:25.696
Let me guess,
you're on team Harvey.

21:25.698 --> 21:27.698
- Exactly.
- What's your plan?

21:40.213 --> 21:42.947
Well?

21:42.949 --> 21:44.281
I love it.

21:44.283 --> 21:45.983
You don't think there's an
end around for her

21:45.985 --> 21:47.318
with an injunction?
- The only way she could do

21:47.320 --> 21:48.686
that if she filed
an ex-parte motion.

21:48.688 --> 21:49.620
Which she can't do
retroactively.

21:49.622 --> 21:51.322
Alex, this is brilliant.

21:51.324 --> 21:53.891
Do you need help filing it?
- No, Louis. I already did.

21:53.893 --> 21:56.827
I was checking to make sure
I didn't miss anything.

21:56.829 --> 21:58.629
Hey, Alex.

21:58.631 --> 22:00.831
Harvey told me that you thought
I was still mad at you

22:00.833 --> 22:02.700
because I didn't come
to you about Zane.

22:02.702 --> 22:04.702
That's not true.
As far as I'm concerned,

22:04.704 --> 22:06.704
you are on our side.
You always will be.

22:06.706 --> 22:09.940
When the time comes,
I'll back you as name partner.

22:09.942 --> 22:12.343
I appreciate that, Louis.

22:12.345 --> 22:14.311
Go get 'em.

22:23.135 --> 22:24.488
Hey, Brian, I was just
about to come--

22:24.489 --> 22:26.823
- See me? Bullshit.
- What do you mean bullshit?

22:26.825 --> 22:29.325
I mean there's no way you
were gonna come see me

22:29.327 --> 22:30.660
because you didn't even
have the balls

22:30.662 --> 22:31.995
to fire me
to my face.

22:31.997 --> 22:33.296
What?
Brian, nobody's firing you.

22:33.298 --> 22:34.631
You're gonna look me
in the eye

22:34.633 --> 22:36.900
and tell me that Katrina
didn't run her numbers

22:36.902 --> 22:39.602
and determine that I don't work
hard enough to serve this firm?

22:39.604 --> 22:40.904
- No, that's not--
- You know what?

22:40.906 --> 22:42.639
If you'd at least come
and told me yourself,

22:42.641 --> 22:44.507
but why should I expect
something like that?

22:44.509 --> 22:46.743
After all, it's not like you
ever held my newborn son.

22:46.745 --> 22:49.179
Brian, please wait.

22:50.348 --> 22:53.149
I told Katrina to find
a way to keep you

22:53.151 --> 22:55.285
because I believe
that you

22:55.287 --> 22:56.953
are more than worthy
of serving this firm.

22:56.955 --> 23:00.211
And I do care about you
and that is the truth.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.078
Yeah, well, maybe you did
tell her all that,

23:02.080 --> 23:04.013
but it didn't stop her
from firing me anyway.

23:04.015 --> 23:05.648
- Brian--
- You know what, Louis?

23:05.650 --> 23:06.816
If you need me, I'll be
spending the next two days

23:06.818 --> 23:08.485
getting my files in order.

23:08.487 --> 23:10.720
Because contrary
to Katrina's analysis,

23:10.722 --> 23:13.790
I care about my clients,
and I'm a damn good lawyer.

23:24.958 --> 23:26.191
Louis, before you say--

23:26.193 --> 23:28.060
What the fuck is
your problem?

23:28.062 --> 23:30.362
I gave you an order
and you blatantly ignored me.

23:30.364 --> 23:31.563
I didn't ignore you.

23:31.565 --> 23:33.198
Then what do
you call firing Brian

23:33.200 --> 23:34.833
when I specifically
told you not to?

23:34.835 --> 23:37.069
Listen to me,
I tried not to fire him.

23:37.071 --> 23:39.671
I took him to lunch, and we--
- Oh, good, lunch.

23:39.673 --> 23:40.939
I hope the chicken potpie
was delicious.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.207
You still didn't do
what I asked.

23:42.209 --> 23:43.709
You know what?

23:43.711 --> 23:45.677
I did do what
you originally asked.

23:45.679 --> 23:47.946
To objectively evaluate
the associates.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.581
Not coddle your teacher's pet.

23:49.583 --> 23:50.816
Screw what
I originally asked.

23:50.818 --> 23:52.451
I told you to rejigger
the metrics

23:52.453 --> 23:54.486
to keep a valued associate.

23:54.488 --> 23:56.054
You think fudging the numbers
wasn't the first thing I tried?

23:56.056 --> 23:57.723
It didn't work.

23:57.725 --> 24:00.258
He always came out too low.
- I don't care.

24:00.260 --> 24:02.260
Well, I do.
Because I care about this firm.

24:02.262 --> 24:04.396
And what kind of message does
rejiggering the metrics

24:04.398 --> 24:07.232
send to the associates
who work 100 hours a week,

24:07.234 --> 24:09.301
who eat dinner here every
night,

24:09.303 --> 24:12.537
who don't even go on dates,
let alone have a baby.

24:12.539 --> 24:15.215
I don't care what message
it sends, Katrina.

24:15.216 --> 24:17.183
Brian is staying.

24:17.185 --> 24:19.218
Then you figure out
who goes instead.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.120
Because I'm not doing something
I don't believe in.

24:21.122 --> 24:24.624
No, Katrina. I told you once
and I'm telling you again.

24:24.626 --> 24:27.560
You asked for this job;
you are doing it.

24:40.628 --> 24:42.027
Harvey.

24:42.029 --> 24:43.295
You need to take
a look at this.

24:43.297 --> 24:44.830
- What is it?
- It just came in.

24:44.832 --> 24:46.965
It's a proposed contract
of sale for Clavatin's--

24:46.967 --> 24:49.168
Manufacturing division.
Son of a bitch.

24:49.170 --> 24:50.869
I need to find out where

24:50.871 --> 24:52.504
Judge Thomas is and I
need to find out now.

24:52.506 --> 24:54.640
Harvey, you can't do this
without Alex. It's his case.

24:54.642 --> 24:55.874
Then why the hell are you

24:55.876 --> 24:57.342
the one telling me this
and not him?

24:57.344 --> 24:58.677
Because he's probably out
there fighting

24:58.679 --> 25:00.312
because he thinks
he can still win.

25:00.313 --> 25:01.880
Well,
he's got one thing right.

25:01.882 --> 25:03.748
We can still win.
But he can't.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.750
And if you cut him out,
you won't win either.

25:05.752 --> 25:07.152
You think I can't take
Samantha Wheeler?

25:07.154 --> 25:08.853
I think you said
you'd stay out of it.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.489
And if you take over now
without even telling Alex,

25:11.491 --> 25:13.691
then you can find out where
Judge Thomas is yourself.

25:13.852 --> 25:15.852
Because I'm not gonna help you
tell your own team

25:15.854 --> 25:16.987
that you'll cut them
out just to get

25:16.989 --> 25:18.488
the better of Samantha Wheeler.

25:18.490 --> 25:20.457
Look, you want
to tell Alex what I'm doing?

25:20.459 --> 25:22.893
Go ahead. I am not
about to sit on the sidelines

25:22.895 --> 25:24.895
and watch us lose.

25:27.285 --> 25:29.385
Harvey.

25:31.022 --> 25:33.555
I'm only gonna ask
you this once.

25:35.126 --> 25:36.692
Is there a chance you're
that overreacting

25:36.694 --> 25:38.661
to Mike having just left?

25:38.663 --> 25:39.995
I don't know, Donna.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.564
But to tell you the truth,
I don't care.

25:44.669 --> 25:46.468
Okay.

25:46.470 --> 25:48.671
You win.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.907
I'll find out
where Judge Thomas is.

26:01.115 --> 26:03.610
Heavy is the head.

26:03.652 --> 26:06.786
Especially when what has
to be done is unjust.

26:06.788 --> 26:07.954
You still don't
think that Brian

26:07.956 --> 26:09.155
deserves to stay, do you?

26:09.157 --> 26:10.657
No, I don't.

26:10.659 --> 26:12.191
And when I told Louis
that it would send

26:12.193 --> 26:14.300
the wrong kind of message
to the people who work

26:14.301 --> 26:18.169
their asses off for this firm
a lot more than Brian,

26:18.171 --> 26:19.905
he said he didn't give a shit.

26:19.907 --> 26:21.973
I see.

26:21.975 --> 26:23.808
And what Louis
didn't understand was

26:23.810 --> 26:26.144
that the people you're talking
about weren't just people.

26:26.146 --> 26:28.780
It was you.
- How could you--

26:28.782 --> 26:30.715
Because I know what
it's like to give everything

26:30.717 --> 26:32.083
and still be taken for granted.

26:32.085 --> 26:33.785
And for what it's worth,
I think Louis

26:33.787 --> 26:36.521
was wrong to say what he did.

26:36.793 --> 26:39.194
But he isn't wrong about Brian.

26:39.196 --> 26:41.296
- Well, I don't agree.
- I understand that.

26:41.298 --> 26:43.298
Probably has something to do
with why you told Harvey

26:43.300 --> 26:45.133
that I shouldn't
be made partner last year.

26:45.135 --> 26:47.602
- You knew about that?
- I do now.

26:48.538 --> 26:49.904
- Donna, it wasn't--
- Tell me.

26:49.906 --> 26:51.639
You ran all the numbers
for Louis,

26:51.641 --> 26:53.875
who are the top five most
efficient associates?

26:54.811 --> 26:58.947
Jesse, Sarah, Ryan, Carl,
and Gina.

26:58.949 --> 27:01.560
- Where does Brian sit?
- Right here.

27:01.565 --> 27:04.352
Right here in the center of
those five people?

27:05.090 --> 27:08.024
Do you think
that's a coincidence?

27:08.026 --> 27:09.626
- I had--
- Katrina.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.228
What you have yet to learn
is that there are players

27:12.230 --> 27:13.930
who never put up great stats,
but you keep them

27:13.932 --> 27:17.334
around because they make
the people around them better.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.869
Are you talking about Brian
or you?

27:19.871 --> 27:22.172
I'm talking about both.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.907
So what do I do?

27:23.909 --> 27:25.342
You do what
you said you'd do.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.011
You evaluate the associates.

27:28.013 --> 27:31.314
Only this time, do it better.

27:33.613 --> 27:35.680
I'm sorry, Donna.

27:38.351 --> 27:40.251
I shouldn't have gone
to Harvey.

27:40.253 --> 27:42.420
It's okay, Katrina.

27:42.422 --> 27:45.290
COO is where I'm meant to be.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.547
- Harvey.
- Alex,

27:52.549 --> 27:54.349
before you say anything--
- No, you gave me your word

27:54.351 --> 27:56.117
that you were gonna
stay out of this.

27:56.119 --> 27:57.252
The next thing I know,
you're having a meeting

27:57.254 --> 27:59.020
about my client without me.

27:59.022 --> 28:00.488
- First of all, it's my client.
- And it's my case.

28:00.490 --> 28:02.023
Which you were about to lose.

28:02.025 --> 28:03.691
- It was a setback.
- Bullshit.

28:03.693 --> 28:05.293
You were getting
your ass kicked.

28:05.295 --> 28:06.928
And don't tell me you weren't.
- God damn it, Harvey.

28:06.930 --> 28:09.030
Listen to me, Alex.
This woman is no joke.

28:09.032 --> 28:10.765
You saying I am?

28:10.767 --> 28:13.167
I'm saying I just met with
Judge Thomas,

28:13.169 --> 28:15.903
so I know exactly what
it's gonna take to beat her.

28:16.060 --> 28:18.795
So the hell what? I can play
dirty just as well as you.

28:18.797 --> 28:20.329
Maybe you can,
but I gave you a promise

28:20.331 --> 28:22.064
to put your name on the wall.

28:22.066 --> 28:24.667
And if you play dirty to beat
Robert Zane's right hand,

28:24.669 --> 28:26.602
it isn't gonna happen.
- You know what I think?

28:26.604 --> 28:28.204
That sounds like some bullshit
by a guy

28:28.206 --> 28:30.611
who's just gonna do what
he wants like he always does.

28:30.612 --> 28:34.047
What I want, Alex,
is to stay managing partner.

28:34.049 --> 28:35.415
This is the way
that's gonna happen.

28:35.417 --> 28:36.883
- Harvey, I--
- That's enough.

28:36.885 --> 28:38.985
I'm taking it from here.

28:38.987 --> 28:40.486
It's done.

28:53.239 --> 28:55.206
Katrina, I've got a lot
on my plate this morning.

28:55.208 --> 28:56.707
So if you don't mind--

28:56.709 --> 28:58.943
You just want your morning
coffee, I know.

28:59.812 --> 29:01.946
Was that part of
your efficiency evaluations?

29:01.948 --> 29:04.115
People's coffee consumption?

29:04.306 --> 29:07.207
Look, Brian,
I was wrong about you.

29:07.209 --> 29:09.142
I understand what you do
for the firm

29:09.144 --> 29:11.644
and I'm sorry for
the things I said.

29:11.646 --> 29:14.647
Well, I appreciate that,
but if you're just saying this

29:14.649 --> 29:17.050
because Louis told you to--
- No, I'm not.

29:17.052 --> 29:19.586
And he didn't.

29:20.622 --> 29:22.555
Then why are you saying it?

29:22.557 --> 29:24.157
Because I took
this assignment hoping

29:24.159 --> 29:25.758
that it would help me grow.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.127
And if I can't ask for help
when I need it,

29:28.129 --> 29:30.830
then I have even more growing
to do than I thought.

29:30.832 --> 29:32.532
What do you mean ask
for help?

29:32.534 --> 29:34.667
My evaluation
of the associates was flawed.

29:34.669 --> 29:37.971
It didn't take into
account intangibles, and...

29:37.973 --> 29:39.872
I was hoping you could help
me fix that.

29:39.874 --> 29:41.608
You mean you want me
to help you figure out

29:41.610 --> 29:43.443
who to fire instead of me.

29:43.445 --> 29:44.744
No, Brian,
that's not what I meant.

29:44.746 --> 29:46.312
Yes, it is.
And I'm sure firing

29:46.314 --> 29:48.314
my fellow associates is
a value to the firm,

29:48.316 --> 29:49.849
but I'm not gonna help you
do it.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.317
- What the hell did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

30:01.319 --> 30:03.653
Well, except for
the thing that I did.

30:03.655 --> 30:04.887
You mean going
to Judge Thomas

30:04.889 --> 30:06.989
and having him allow
fabricated testimony

30:06.991 --> 30:08.724
to overrule my motion.

30:08.726 --> 30:11.561
It wasn't fabricated, but
it sure as hell was allowed.

30:11.563 --> 30:12.929
And how exactly did you get
him to do that?

30:12.931 --> 30:15.531
You know how I did it,
or you don't.

30:15.533 --> 30:17.533
And if you don't,
well, I'm not about

30:17.535 --> 30:19.020
to open up my playbook
and show you.

30:19.021 --> 30:20.721
Well, Mr. Slick,
I don't give a shit

30:20.723 --> 30:22.422
how you did it.
I'm going to undo it

30:22.424 --> 30:23.905
because this is isn't over.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.572
- Yes, it is.
- We'll see about that.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.907
No, we won't.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.709
Because I'm giving you
a direct order.

30:28.711 --> 30:30.511
You are not to take
any action

30:30.513 --> 30:32.546
to affect the outcome
of this situation.

30:32.548 --> 30:34.581
And you can give me all
the orders you want.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.484
The only person I answer to
is Robert Zane.

30:37.486 --> 30:39.553
So if you want to stop
what I'm about to do,

30:39.555 --> 30:42.523
you better talk to him
before I god damn do it.

30:42.525 --> 30:45.859
- Don't you walk away from me.
- Kiss my ass.

30:49.953 --> 30:51.953
All right, Robert.
I have been patient,

30:51.955 --> 30:53.321
but it's over,
and I've won.

30:53.323 --> 30:54.855
Call off the dogs.

30:54.857 --> 30:56.457
What the hell
did you just say to me?

30:56.459 --> 30:58.426
I said call off the dogs.
I'm not gonna have someone

30:58.428 --> 31:00.795
inside my own firm who
doesn't know when she's lost.

31:00.797 --> 31:02.263
The only one in here
who doesn't know

31:02.265 --> 31:03.764
that they've lost is you.

31:03.766 --> 31:05.433
I didn't lose shit.

31:05.435 --> 31:07.368
And if you think I might,
why don't you pick up the phone

31:07.370 --> 31:08.836
and call
Judge Thomas right now?

31:08.838 --> 31:10.171
I'm not talking about
Judge Thomas.

31:10.173 --> 31:11.839
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

31:11.841 --> 31:13.207
I'm talking about the fact
that you stood right here

31:13.209 --> 31:15.042
and gave your word
that you would stay

31:15.044 --> 31:17.011
out of this thing.
And not only did you break it,

31:17.013 --> 31:19.013
now you're in here trying
to drag me into it.

31:20.406 --> 31:22.440
Nothing to say?
That's right.

31:22.442 --> 31:24.842
You may have won the battle,
but you lost the goddamn war.

31:24.844 --> 31:26.811
Because you just showed
this entire firm

31:26.813 --> 31:28.846
only one of us is
managing partner material.

31:28.848 --> 31:31.182
And it isn't you.

31:31.184 --> 31:32.783
This is my firm,

31:32.785 --> 31:34.318
and I'm not gonna
let you take it.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.054
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Harvey.

31:37.056 --> 31:39.657
I already have.

31:39.659 --> 31:41.726
Now, why don't you let
that rattle around

31:41.728 --> 31:43.160
for a little while,
and then come back

31:43.162 --> 31:45.162
when you're ready
to tell me that I'm right.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.674
You can come in, you know.

32:00.676 --> 32:02.643
- Sorry, I didn't mean to--
- Yes, you did.

32:02.645 --> 32:03.778
You just wanted
to let me finish

32:03.780 --> 32:05.379
whatever I was
in the middle of.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.281
Not bad.

32:07.283 --> 32:08.616
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

32:08.618 --> 32:09.850
No, I mean, thanks

32:09.852 --> 32:11.419
for sticking up
for me with Katrina.

32:11.421 --> 32:13.554
- You figured it out.
- I did.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.124
I was right about you.

32:17.126 --> 32:18.325
Aren't you right
about everybody?

32:18.327 --> 32:20.227
Yeah, pretty much.

32:20.229 --> 32:23.063
And now I have something else
to be right about.

32:24.801 --> 32:26.634
Katrina needs your help.

32:26.636 --> 32:28.302
Maybe she does,
but if I'd thought

32:28.304 --> 32:30.037
about the fact
that me staying would mean

32:30.039 --> 32:32.907
someone I care about might
get fired...

32:32.909 --> 32:34.675
I wouldn't have gone to Louis
in the first place.

32:34.677 --> 32:36.644
And that, right there,
is the reason we were right

32:36.646 --> 32:39.480
to keep you.
And as I see it...

32:39.482 --> 32:41.782
You can either help Katrina
make the right decision,

32:41.784 --> 32:44.885
or live with the fact that
she might make the wrong one.

32:44.887 --> 32:47.488
Like she almost did with you.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.372
Harvey,
what can I do for you?

33:04.374 --> 33:06.107
I'll tell you what
you should have done for me.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.109
Stop me from taking
the case from Alex.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.710
And if you recall,
that's what I tried to do.

33:09.712 --> 33:11.045
And then
you changed your mind.

33:11.047 --> 33:12.313
Because I listened to you.

33:12.315 --> 33:13.614
Oh, well,
you picked a hell of a time

33:13.616 --> 33:15.550
to start doing that
because Zane set me up.

33:15.552 --> 33:17.218
I don't care what Zane did,

33:17.220 --> 33:18.619
you went after her
because it's who you are.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.955
And you're supposed to be
saving me from myself.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.356
Which is exactly what I did.

33:22.358 --> 33:23.458
How the hell
do you figure that?

33:23.460 --> 33:25.293
Harvey, Mike left.

33:25.583 --> 33:27.116
What does that have to do
with this?

33:27.118 --> 33:28.417
It has everything
to do with is.

33:28.419 --> 33:30.052
Because the reason
he left is because

33:30.054 --> 33:33.222
he finally came to terms
with who he is.

33:33.224 --> 33:34.923
And now that he's gone,

33:34.925 --> 33:37.659
who you are is a man
who wants back in the game.

33:37.661 --> 33:40.562
Don't you see, you've been
to the top of the mountain.

33:40.564 --> 33:42.331
You've proved you can
do it, and you may not

33:42.333 --> 33:45.200
want to admit it, but...

33:45.202 --> 33:46.835
you're getting tired
of just sitting up there,

33:46.837 --> 33:49.271
enjoying the view.

33:49.273 --> 33:50.806
Donna,
how's it gonna look

33:50.808 --> 33:52.875
to the rest of the world
if I step down?

33:52.877 --> 33:54.743
I'll tell you how.

33:54.745 --> 33:56.645
Like no other firm
can touch us.

33:56.647 --> 33:58.914
Not with you and Robert
doing what everybody knows

33:58.916 --> 34:01.717
you were meant to do.

34:01.719 --> 34:04.486
And by that...

34:04.488 --> 34:05.654
I mean pulling off
the kind of shit

34:05.656 --> 34:07.990
that only Harvey Specter
can do.

34:20.471 --> 34:21.905
Katrina.

34:21.907 --> 34:23.739
You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

34:23.742 --> 34:25.475
Bridget, please sit down.

34:33.889 --> 34:36.090
Am I getting fired?

34:36.092 --> 34:38.626
Yes.
I'm afraid you are.

34:38.628 --> 34:40.428
Katrina,
I know we merged,

34:40.429 --> 34:42.897
but I have
a ton of student debt.

34:42.899 --> 34:48.168
My landlord just raised my
rent, and...

34:48.170 --> 34:50.670
I promised to pay for
my nephew's daycare

34:50.672 --> 34:53.774
so my sister could go back
to school.

34:53.775 --> 34:56.043
Please.

34:56.045 --> 34:57.645
There's got
to be something I can do

34:57.647 --> 35:00.014
to get a second chance.

35:03.286 --> 35:05.119
I'm sorry,
Bridget,

35:05.121 --> 35:07.922
but the decision's
already been made.

35:09.292 --> 35:11.492
I do wish you the best of luck.

35:33.917 --> 35:36.818
You know, life was simpler
when this was my office.

35:36.820 --> 35:39.020
As I understand,
when you were in this office

35:39.022 --> 35:41.923
you almost went to
prison for Mike Ross.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.794
I don't see what
was simpler about that.

35:46.165 --> 35:47.998
Yeah, you do.

35:49.568 --> 35:51.535
Robert, you said
that I should come back

35:51.537 --> 35:53.971
when I was ready to admit
that you were right.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.708
Well, I'm back.

35:57.710 --> 36:01.545
Takes a big man
to admit that, Harvey.

36:01.547 --> 36:03.614
I appreciate it.

36:03.616 --> 36:05.582
You're not gonna try
to hug me, are you?

36:05.584 --> 36:07.117
I don't know what goes on
between you and Louis,

36:07.119 --> 36:08.752
but I'll pass.

36:10.222 --> 36:12.523
Then I guess this is
the part where I make

36:12.525 --> 36:15.702
my first humble request
to my fearless leader.

36:15.703 --> 36:19.171
That took about two seconds.

36:19.173 --> 36:21.173
Let's hear it.

36:21.175 --> 36:23.175
My office.

36:23.711 --> 36:27.012
- What about it?
- I want it back.

36:28.582 --> 36:31.016
In that case,
your fearless leader

36:31.018 --> 36:33.218
is happy to comply.

36:40.361 --> 36:42.261
What do you say we go out
and grab those burgers?

36:42.263 --> 36:44.229
Not tonight, but we will.

36:45.420 --> 36:48.755
I still have something I have
to take care of.

36:58.734 --> 37:01.534
- You were right.
- About what?

37:01.536 --> 37:04.271
It wasn't easy firing
those people.

37:04.273 --> 37:07.474
- So it's done?
- It's done.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.010
You mind if I ask
if Brian ended up

37:10.012 --> 37:11.511
helping with this list?

37:11.513 --> 37:12.779
He did.

37:12.781 --> 37:15.382
And you were right
about him too.

37:15.384 --> 37:18.618
Well, as long as we're
handing out "You were rights,"

37:19.655 --> 37:21.922
You were right about being
the one to let those people go.

37:21.924 --> 37:23.857
You mean it's good for
my growth.

37:23.859 --> 37:26.927
No, I mean, I'm glad I didn't
have to do it. It sucks.

37:30.106 --> 37:32.873
Hey, you want to grab
a drink or something?

37:32.875 --> 37:35.876
- I'd love to.
- Katrina.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.645
Robert.

37:37.647 --> 37:39.513
Give me a second with
Red here, will you?

37:39.515 --> 37:42.450
Of course.
I'll be in my office.

37:42.452 --> 37:44.685
Am I in trouble?

37:44.687 --> 37:46.554
Why,
you do something wrong?

37:46.556 --> 37:49.457
I guess that depends on what
you mean by wrong.

37:49.459 --> 37:51.592
I'm not here
because you're in trouble.

37:51.594 --> 37:54.795
I'm here because Harvey
just asked me to swap offices

37:54.797 --> 37:57.731
and then he told I was right.

37:59.064 --> 38:00.797
And I doubt those words
have ever come out

38:00.799 --> 38:02.232
of that man's mouth
without first having

38:02.234 --> 38:04.501
a conversation with you.

38:04.503 --> 38:05.769
You sound pretty sure
of yourself for a man

38:05.771 --> 38:07.137
who's only been here
about ten minutes.

38:07.139 --> 38:08.672
You think Rachel
didn't tell her father

38:08.674 --> 38:10.607
about the mighty Donna Paulsen?

38:11.877 --> 38:15.045
Guess I never thought of her
as much of a chatterbox.

38:16.282 --> 38:18.415
Then again, she did tell me
about the time that you took--

38:18.417 --> 38:20.517
Whatever it is.
Just remember,

38:21.168 --> 38:22.568
once you say it out loud,

38:22.570 --> 38:24.336
we can never pretend
that you don't know it.

38:24.338 --> 38:26.471
And that,
Robert Lucas Zane,

38:26.473 --> 38:28.941
is why
you are managing partner.

38:30.377 --> 38:33.779
- Good night, Donna.
- Good night, Robert.

38:38.319 --> 38:41.987
You really have no concept
of boundaries, do you?

38:41.989 --> 38:44.056
You know,
most people would be here

38:44.058 --> 38:46.058
to tell you they think
we got off on the wrong foot.

38:46.060 --> 38:49.294
But I'm here to say
we got off on the right one,

38:49.296 --> 38:50.762
And what foot is that?

38:50.764 --> 38:52.264
The one where you
and I discover

38:52.266 --> 38:53.532
we're not
so different after all.

38:53.534 --> 38:54.866
I don't think
I'm anything like you.

38:54.868 --> 38:56.468
You are.
Right down to the fact

38:56.470 --> 38:58.837
that we both grew up in
Riverside, New York.

38:58.839 --> 39:01.139
Which is why we'll both
always feel like outsiders

39:01.141 --> 39:03.141
no matter how much we earn
their respect.

39:03.143 --> 39:05.096
How do you know
that about me?

39:05.097 --> 39:07.197
Because I do my homework.

39:08.501 --> 39:10.901
Maybe we are alike.

39:10.903 --> 39:12.436
That's all I wanted to say.

39:12.438 --> 39:13.904
Except for one thing.

39:13.906 --> 39:16.507
You told Jeremy Stiller
that you grew up on a farm,

39:16.509 --> 39:19.610
and last I checked there aren't
any farms in Riverside.

39:19.612 --> 39:22.674
And that little observation
is the reason

39:22.675 --> 39:24.058
we got off on the right foot.

39:24.059 --> 39:25.659
I don't follow.

39:25.661 --> 39:27.060
There are three things
that happen

39:27.062 --> 39:28.862
when I tell different people
different stories.

39:28.864 --> 39:31.632
One, they don't recognize it.

39:31.634 --> 39:33.400
Which means I don't need
to worry about them.

39:33.402 --> 39:34.902
Two,
they know I did it,

39:34.904 --> 39:36.670
but don't have the balls
to say anything.

39:36.672 --> 39:38.939
Which means I need to worry
about them even less.

39:39.285 --> 39:42.686
Or three, they call me on it.

39:42.688 --> 39:45.322
And believe me,
three is my kind of guy.

39:46.659 --> 39:50.027
Well, in that case,
welcome to the firm.

39:50.029 --> 39:52.029
Glad to be here.

39:52.031 --> 39:55.966
Oh, and by the way,
I would have won.

40:10.321 --> 40:11.920
Alex.

40:11.922 --> 40:13.522
It's 10:00 at night;
what are you doing?

40:13.524 --> 40:15.324
I'm going through every one
of Samantha Wheeler's files.

40:15.326 --> 40:18.160
'Cause a fight's coming,
and I'm gonna be ready.

40:18.162 --> 40:20.329
Okay, listen to me.

40:20.331 --> 40:24.967
Because, believe me,
I've been where you are before.

40:24.969 --> 40:26.835
Don't start something
that you'll regret later.

40:26.837 --> 40:27.936
Then what am
I supposed to do?

40:27.938 --> 40:29.505
How 'bout you make
a friend now

40:29.507 --> 40:30.939
that you'll be
happy about later.

40:30.941 --> 40:33.141
Are you crazy? She's not
looking to make friends.

40:33.143 --> 40:34.743
Maybe not, but, Alex,
listen to me.

40:34.745 --> 40:36.778
In the long run,
this woman is going nowhere.

40:36.780 --> 40:39.381
Got Harvey and me on your side.
You get the trifecta,

40:39.383 --> 40:42.050
I don't care what she does.
Never gonna beat you again.

40:42.052 --> 40:44.453
Are you suggesting I kiss
Robert Zane's ass?

40:44.455 --> 40:46.421
'Cause I'm not gonna do that.
- No, Alex.

40:46.423 --> 40:49.175
I'm just saying
get to know the man.

40:49.176 --> 40:51.209
And how exactly would you
suggest I do that?

40:51.211 --> 40:53.011
That's up to you.
I happen to know

40:53.013 --> 40:54.813
the man plays golf.
So do you.

40:54.815 --> 40:58.550
If it were up to me,
I would start right there.

41:14.470 --> 41:16.403
Make yourself at home.

41:16.405 --> 41:18.338
Don't mind if I do.

41:19.375 --> 41:21.942
Well, as long as you're here.

41:21.944 --> 41:24.311
You came through,
like always.

41:24.313 --> 41:25.979
Thanks, Samantha.
- Like always.

41:25.981 --> 41:28.549
What happened to, "You let me
down a time or two"?

41:28.551 --> 41:30.984
Come on, you know I get like
that sometimes.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.820
What's going on?
Something on your mind?

41:33.822 --> 41:36.023
Yeah, there is.
I did what you asked and

41:36.025 --> 41:38.802
now I have something to ask.
- What's that?

41:38.803 --> 41:41.004
I don't want to just be
your Michael Clayton.

41:41.006 --> 41:43.373
I want more.

41:43.510 --> 41:46.177
- I'm married.
- Come on, Robert.

41:46.179 --> 41:48.346
You know what I want,
and it's time.

41:48.348 --> 41:50.014
Samantha,
we've been over this.

41:50.016 --> 41:52.950
You get name partner, and
you're not going to be able

41:52.952 --> 41:54.652
to operate the way
you always have.

41:54.654 --> 41:56.448
You mean I won't be able
to clean up your messes.

41:56.449 --> 41:58.883
My messes aren't
the only ones you clean up.

41:58.885 --> 42:00.685
I believe you spend half
the time cleaning up your own.

42:00.687 --> 42:02.987
Oh, is that what I spent
the last few days doing?

42:02.989 --> 42:04.956
- Samantha?
- Robert, I want name partner.

42:04.958 --> 42:06.924
And I want it before
the year is out.

42:06.926 --> 42:08.793
Or what?

42:08.795 --> 42:10.895
Before the year is out,
Robert.
