00:23.079 --> 00:26.064
♪ Dish-a-de-dee,
da-da-washin' the dishes ♪

00:26.065 --> 00:27.766
♪ Aba-ba-ba-ba.

00:27.767 --> 00:30.101
All right, all done with the dishes.

00:30.102 --> 00:32.654
Time for family game night.
Whoo!

00:32.655 --> 00:35.841
Left hand red. Whoa-oh!

00:35.842 --> 00:37.676
I'm losing my balance. Whoa!

00:37.677 --> 00:39.778
Bob? Kids?

00:39.779 --> 00:41.079
Where is everyone?
What's up?

00:42.081 --> 00:43.982
Take that.

00:44.016 --> 00:45.967
And that.
You naughty witch.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.003
What's, uh... what's going on?

00:48.037 --> 00:49.905
It's this thing
we do with Dad. Yah!

00:49.906 --> 00:51.556
It's called
"stone the witch."

00:51.557 --> 00:53.458
Dad's the witch, but it's just pretend.

00:53.459 --> 00:54.926
Right, Dad?

00:54.927 --> 00:57.095
Well, as you know,
it's family game night

00:57.096 --> 00:59.181
and things are really heating up
in the living room,

00:59.182 --> 01:00.215
so, you know...

01:00.249 --> 01:02.017
Come on, kids.
I feel limber.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.735
I'm ready to dominate.

01:03.736 --> 01:06.204
Um, how about a rain check on that?
Let me up.

01:06.205 --> 01:08.440
We're kind of in the middle
of something here.

01:08.474 --> 01:10.876
Well, then I'll just play
this with you guys.

01:10.877 --> 01:12.777
Whoa, ooh, here comes the blanket.

01:12.778 --> 01:14.930
That'll warm you to death.

01:14.931 --> 01:16.448
Yeah.

01:16.449 --> 01:18.850
And, oh, ooh...
how about this catalog?

01:18.885 --> 01:21.086
You can learn all about
the season's new blazers.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.454
Wait, I'm lost.

01:22.488 --> 01:24.256
Okay, let's take five, everybody.

01:24.257 --> 01:26.925
What? No, hey, ooh,
how about doilies?

01:26.926 --> 01:29.127
We can have a fancy witch
with a doily hat.

01:29.128 --> 01:30.595
Hmm.
Mom, it's over.

01:30.596 --> 01:31.930
You ruined it, okay?

01:31.931 --> 01:33.632
You "mommed" it all up.
Uh-oh.

01:33.633 --> 01:35.300
What's that supposed to mean?

01:35.301 --> 01:37.389
Dad's here... did he
"dad" it all up?

01:37.403 --> 01:38.670
Yeah, but that's a good thing.

01:38.671 --> 01:40.322
- Oh, boy.
- Fine!

01:40.323 --> 01:42.424
I don't want to play your
dumb old game anyway.

01:42.458 --> 01:44.543
Well, that's 'cause you suck at it.

01:44.544 --> 01:46.628
Uh-oh.
Ouch.

01:46.662 --> 01:48.330
Oh, God.
Don't you talk

01:48.331 --> 01:50.265
to me that way, Miss Smart Mouth.

01:50.299 --> 01:52.367
You just bought yourself
a ticket to your room.

01:52.401 --> 01:54.619
Oh, fine.
Best money I ever spent.

01:54.620 --> 01:56.438
You can't ruin anything in there.

01:56.439 --> 02:00.120
I'm going back to
family game night by myself!

02:00.125 --> 02:02.193
- Oh. Oh.
- Oops.

02:02.194 --> 02:03.828
May I? I'd look
great in that.

02:03.829 --> 02:04.946
I'd look great in that.

02:04.947 --> 02:06.314
I'd look great in that.

02:06.315 --> 02:09.300
Right foot blue.
Terrific, I win.

02:13.372 --> 02:14.773
Lin, you okay?
Mm-hmm.

02:14.774 --> 02:15.857
You're not mad, are you?

02:15.858 --> 02:18.710
No, no.
Okay, well, good night.

02:18.711 --> 02:20.328
Oh, you just think you're so much fun.

02:20.329 --> 02:21.680
Don't you, Mr. Fun Buns?

02:21.681 --> 02:23.098
- What?
- I'm sorry.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.482
It's just that Louise.

02:24.483 --> 02:25.717
She's always liked you better.

02:25.718 --> 02:27.118
Ever since she was a baby.

02:27.153 --> 02:29.287
Are you Mommy's little girl?

02:29.288 --> 02:30.388
Dada.

02:30.389 --> 02:31.723
And Mama.

02:31.724 --> 02:33.058
Dada.

02:33.059 --> 02:34.159
- Mama.
- Dada.

02:34.193 --> 02:35.794
- Mama.
- Dada.

02:35.795 --> 02:36.828
Dada.

02:36.862 --> 02:38.396
- Mama.
- Dada.

02:38.397 --> 02:39.431
- Mama.
- Dada.

02:39.465 --> 02:40.699
M... Ma...
Da... Da...

02:40.733 --> 02:42.167
Ma. Ma. Ma.
Da. Da. Da.

02:42.201 --> 02:44.035
Da, da, da! Ma... ma!
All right, you know what?

02:44.036 --> 02:45.165
Change your own diaper.

02:45.171 --> 02:46.338
Well, don't worry, Lin.

02:46.339 --> 02:48.039
She's just going through a phase.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.308
A nine-year phase...
she'll grow out of it.

02:50.309 --> 02:51.643
Well, I'm not waiting for that.

02:51.644 --> 02:52.877
According to the Phenomimom...

02:52.878 --> 02:54.646
The Phenomimom?

02:54.680 --> 02:56.848
It's a mommy blog, by Dakota Applebaum.

02:56.882 --> 02:59.217
She says one way mothers
and daughters connect

02:59.218 --> 03:01.052
is through story time.

03:01.053 --> 03:03.555
Phenomimom...
that's fun to say.

03:03.556 --> 03:05.740
I am gonna go story that little punk.

03:05.741 --> 03:07.125
Sounds good.

03:07.159 --> 03:09.995
Louise, you awake, baby?

03:09.996 --> 03:10.995
Louise?

03:10.997 --> 03:11.996
- Louise!
- Huh?

03:11.998 --> 03:13.068
What? What's going on?

03:13.099 --> 03:15.133
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

03:15.167 --> 03:16.835
Look what I brought.

03:16.836 --> 03:19.638
<i>Princess Pigeon Toe...</i> remember?

03:19.672 --> 03:21.072
- Oh, no.
- Uh-huh.

03:21.073 --> 03:22.240
Not that book.
Scootch over.

03:22.241 --> 03:23.240
Scootch.

03:23.242 --> 03:24.275
This is a twin.
Come on.

03:24.276 --> 03:25.610
There's not a lot of room.

03:25.611 --> 03:27.579
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move.

03:27.580 --> 03:31.650
"Princess Pigeon Toe lived in a
peacock castle on Penguin Lane."

03:31.684 --> 03:33.051
Please stop, please stop, please stop.

03:33.085 --> 03:35.053
"Every day, she went to Parakeet Park

03:35.054 --> 03:36.955
to play pinochle
with Pauly the Porpoise."

03:36.956 --> 03:39.357
Oh, no! Please,
just let me sleep!

03:39.358 --> 03:42.377
"Sometimes they take a picnic
basket full of pickles

03:42.378 --> 03:44.646
and peppers and pumpkin pie!"
Please make it stop!

03:48.351 --> 03:50.352
It's Claire and Jacqueline.
Who?

03:50.353 --> 03:51.953
The most popular girls at school.

03:51.954 --> 03:55.110
How do I look?
Oh, good...

03:55.124 --> 03:58.059
Hi. I'm Tina.
I'll be your server today,

03:58.060 --> 04:00.762
and hopefully in the future,
your good friend.

04:00.763 --> 04:02.564
That's nice.
I'll have a cheeseburger.

04:02.565 --> 04:03.698
Me, too.

04:03.699 --> 04:04.933
Okay, two cheeseburgers...

04:04.934 --> 04:07.302
Claire, did you see Rachel's legs?

04:07.303 --> 04:08.903
They are so hairy.

04:08.904 --> 04:10.872
Oh, my God, I know...
so gross.

04:10.873 --> 04:12.474
Right?
Get a razor, girl.

04:12.475 --> 04:14.075
More like a lawnmower.

04:16.045 --> 04:17.644
Yeah-oh!

04:19.615 --> 04:21.099
When did you get there?

04:21.100 --> 04:22.350
What'd you say?
Nothing.

04:22.385 --> 04:24.119
Gene, hide my legs.
On it!

04:25.821 --> 04:27.455
Nothing to see here.

04:27.456 --> 04:30.103
This is just how we walk
in the restaurant biz.

04:30.126 --> 04:31.893
<i>Aw.</i>

04:31.927 --> 04:33.661
My teeny Tina's growing up.

04:33.662 --> 04:35.263
With her little leg hairs.

04:35.264 --> 04:36.614
Just shave up to the knee.

04:36.649 --> 04:38.449
Only strippers shave above the knee.

04:38.450 --> 04:39.667
The good ones anyway.
Okay.

04:39.668 --> 04:42.303
- Um... who did this?
- I did.

04:42.304 --> 04:43.303
Oh, you did?

04:43.305 --> 04:45.073
Yes.
Oh, what a surprise.

04:45.074 --> 04:46.274
Well, you left it in my room.

04:46.308 --> 04:47.475
Yeah, the Phenomi...

04:47.476 --> 04:49.644
I mean, I think it's important

04:49.645 --> 04:53.148
to create tangible expressions
of our relationship.

04:53.182 --> 04:55.784
Oh, well, isn't that...
Whoops.

04:55.785 --> 04:57.352
Hey, you hang that up in your room.

04:57.353 --> 04:59.521
You know you're gonna need
your mother someday.

04:59.522 --> 05:01.256
Who's gonna shave your legs, huh?

05:01.257 --> 05:04.175
No one... I'm gonna grow them out
all long and scraggily.

05:04.176 --> 05:07.512
I want to look like a torso
on two tumbleweeds.

05:07.513 --> 05:10.515
And I'm gonna learn
about sex from television,

05:10.516 --> 05:13.355
so I don't need that from you, either!

05:13.385 --> 05:15.954
Wait, maybe you should take
some time to cool off.

05:15.955 --> 05:17.856
Yeah, I don't think
you should shave angry.

05:17.890 --> 05:20.141
Who's angry?

05:22.812 --> 05:24.279
Uh, listen, Lin,

05:24.280 --> 05:26.881
do you think you might
be forcing it a little?

05:26.882 --> 05:28.817
I'm not forcing it, Bob!
Right.

05:28.818 --> 05:31.686
Louise is gonna see that
her best friend is her mommy

05:31.687 --> 05:33.988
even if I have to shake it into her.
Ow.

05:33.989 --> 05:35.890
Shake it, yes, shake it.
Stop, no, stop.

05:35.891 --> 05:36.890
Like that.

05:36.892 --> 05:38.993
Ooh, look.

05:38.994 --> 05:40.966
- No.
- Yes.

05:40.996 --> 05:43.364
No, no, no, no.
Yes!

05:43.399 --> 05:45.183
Okay, here we go.

05:45.184 --> 05:46.918
Going on a little errand, that's all.

05:46.919 --> 05:48.486
We need to talk.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.872
Look, I think we should
spend some time apart.

05:50.906 --> 05:52.190
Mm-hmm, yeah.

05:52.208 --> 05:53.408
I'm just not really looking

05:53.409 --> 05:54.876
for something serious right now.

05:54.910 --> 05:56.044
Sure, sure, honey.

05:56.078 --> 05:57.862
You understand...
I mean, yeah,

05:57.863 --> 05:59.214
it's gonna be a little awkward.

05:59.215 --> 06:00.899
You got some of your stuff at my place.

06:00.933 --> 06:02.517
We live together...
We're here!

06:02.551 --> 06:05.503
Laser tag... a little dated,
but all right.

06:05.504 --> 06:06.538
Not that.

06:06.539 --> 06:09.174
That!

06:10.743 --> 06:12.060
I've been kidnapped!

06:12.061 --> 06:13.928
No, she hasn't.
We're fine.

06:13.929 --> 06:16.380
Keep moving.
Nothing to see here.

06:16.381 --> 06:17.821
Nice blouse.

06:19.910 --> 06:22.016
Come on.
No, no, no, no,

06:22.051 --> 06:23.651
- no!
- Louise, relax.

06:23.652 --> 06:25.286
It's not like I'm torturing you.

06:25.287 --> 06:27.155
I'm just taking you
to an eight-hour

06:27.156 --> 06:28.222
mother/daughter seminar.

06:28.223 --> 06:29.540
Eight hours?!

06:29.541 --> 06:31.843
Yes, our relationship needs help.

06:31.844 --> 06:33.511
Professional help.

06:33.512 --> 06:34.545
Hey!

06:34.546 --> 06:36.697
Start, damn you, start.

06:38.817 --> 06:40.051
No!
Oh, all right, all right.

06:40.052 --> 06:41.319
- 20 bucks.
- What?

06:41.320 --> 06:42.403
I'll give you 20 bucks

06:42.404 --> 06:44.072
if you come and do this with me.

06:44.073 --> 06:45.673
Interesting... $1,000.

06:45.674 --> 06:47.208
- $28.
- $29.50.

06:47.209 --> 06:49.410
Deal.
This is gonna be the hardest money

06:49.411 --> 06:50.645
I've ever earned.

06:50.646 --> 06:51.879
Unless you become a hooker.

06:55.901 --> 06:57.535
Welcome, everyone.

06:57.536 --> 07:00.321
Welcome to my mother/daughter
seminar... Modo Time.

07:00.322 --> 07:01.381
I'm Dakota.

07:01.382 --> 07:02.590
You're the Phenomimom?

07:02.591 --> 07:03.590
But you're a man.

07:03.592 --> 07:04.876
I am a man.

07:04.877 --> 07:06.244
And that's okay.

07:06.245 --> 07:08.428
The female spirit flows
through all of us.

07:08.447 --> 07:10.848
We're all estro-geniuses.

07:10.849 --> 07:12.250
Everybody stand up and say it,

07:12.251 --> 07:13.518
"I am an estro-genius."

07:13.519 --> 07:15.686
I am an estro-genius.

07:15.687 --> 07:16.686
Oh, dear.

07:16.688 --> 07:18.573
Guys, today we are going back.

07:18.574 --> 07:20.608
We're gonna go all the way back
to the womb.

07:20.609 --> 07:22.443
We're gonna get
into a womb-a-tism!

07:22.444 --> 07:24.444
A what?
A womb-a-tism!

07:24.463 --> 07:26.247
Ooh, a what?

07:26.248 --> 07:27.799
No.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.866
Hi.
Sorry we're late.

07:28.901 --> 07:30.101
Ooh, a male daughter.

07:30.102 --> 07:31.702
Ha-ha, Logan.

07:31.737 --> 07:33.437
Oh, God, <i>it's</i> here.

07:33.438 --> 07:35.973
Sorry, this was
the only seminar available,

07:35.974 --> 07:38.226
and we had an incident yesterday.

07:38.227 --> 07:42.363
Logan called me the "B" word.

07:42.364 --> 07:43.865
Why must that word exist?

07:43.866 --> 07:44.881
Question.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.466
What's the "uter-room?"

07:46.468 --> 07:48.102
Well, I'm hoping what's in that room

07:48.103 --> 07:49.637
won't be necessary.

07:49.638 --> 07:51.846
Now, let Modo Time begin!

07:53.642 --> 07:55.776
Dad, I want you to drop
everything you're doing

07:55.777 --> 07:56.944
and shave my legs.

07:56.945 --> 07:58.579
I'll take care of the first part.

07:58.580 --> 08:00.414
Gene. I was trying
to help.

08:00.415 --> 08:03.274
Uh, Tina, can't you
just shave them yourself?

08:03.285 --> 08:04.318
I tried.

08:04.319 --> 08:06.120
- Oh, God!
- Aah!

08:06.121 --> 08:08.172
Oh, oh, dear.
Oh... oh, my... aah!

08:08.173 --> 08:10.615
No more razors for you.
Just wait for Mom.

08:10.626 --> 08:12.827
You wait for Mom.
If I don't shave this

08:12.828 --> 08:14.495
before school tomorrow,
Claire and Jacqueline might talk

08:14.496 --> 08:16.037
about me at some restaurant.

08:16.064 --> 08:18.299
All right, fine.
Like a seafood restaurant

08:18.300 --> 08:19.600
or a Chinese restaurant.
Tina.

08:19.601 --> 08:21.269
Or that rain forest restaurant

08:21.270 --> 08:22.570
with all the jungle sounds.

08:22.571 --> 08:23.971
Or McCormick and Schmidt's.

08:23.972 --> 08:25.106
I said I'll do it.

08:25.107 --> 08:26.474
Oh, okay, thanks.

08:26.508 --> 08:29.143
There was a time
when you got all you needed

08:29.144 --> 08:31.245
from your mother through a single cord.

08:31.246 --> 08:34.015
Mothers, please strap
your symbolic umbilical cords

08:34.015 --> 08:35.116
to your daughters' faces.

08:35.116 --> 08:37.284
I call them "umbilitators."

08:37.285 --> 08:39.253
That's not how umbilical cords work.

08:39.254 --> 08:41.472
Here we go...
wee-ooh!

08:41.472 --> 08:43.140
It doesn't make any sense.

08:43.140 --> 08:45.443
And feed those fetuses.

08:45.444 --> 08:46.661
Down the hatch.

08:46.662 --> 08:48.479
Louise, open your mouth.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.847
Louise, open your mouth.
Uh-uh.

08:49.848 --> 08:52.600
Yeah, she's fine.
We're fine.

08:52.601 --> 08:54.202
Yes, open that fetus mouth!

08:54.203 --> 08:56.270
Oh, it's fun.

08:56.271 --> 08:57.438
- Money.
- What?

08:57.439 --> 08:59.624
Money, no...
no more extorting me.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.359
Mm-hmm.
Okay, fine.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.110
Five bucks...
now, swallow.

09:03.111 --> 09:05.146
Mmm, oh, she loves it.

09:05.147 --> 09:06.713
Aw.

09:08.283 --> 09:09.383
Oh, hello.

09:09.384 --> 09:11.152
You must be here
for our back waxing special.

09:11.153 --> 09:12.220
Um, no.

09:12.221 --> 09:13.220
Arm waxing?

09:13.222 --> 09:14.522
No.
Scrotal waxing?

09:14.523 --> 09:16.457
No... what? No!
Yeah, that one.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.226
No, no, not that one.
Yes.

09:18.227 --> 09:19.827
Gene, stop.
You need it.

09:19.828 --> 09:21.662
Gene, shut up.
My daughter needs

09:21.663 --> 09:23.271
to get her legs waxed.
Hi.

09:23.298 --> 09:24.732
Oh. Phew.

09:24.733 --> 09:26.984
I mean, not that
I don't want to wax you...

09:26.985 --> 09:29.068
but no, I have my limits.

09:29.087 --> 09:31.122
Okay, well, you don't have to be rude.

09:31.156 --> 09:32.857
Why don't we just take you
in the back, sweetheart?

09:32.858 --> 09:34.425
It's your job, you know.

09:34.426 --> 09:35.593
I'd wax you, Dad.

09:35.594 --> 09:36.701
Thanks, Gene.

09:36.728 --> 09:38.462
Time to be born.

09:38.497 --> 09:40.455
This is disgusting.

09:40.482 --> 09:41.873
You sound just like your father.

09:41.883 --> 09:43.701
Louise, come to Mama.

09:43.702 --> 09:45.953
Oh, no, I think I'm good, thank you.

09:45.988 --> 09:47.505
Can I get some scissors, Dakota?

09:47.506 --> 09:48.856
Do a little C-section?

09:48.857 --> 09:52.026
Those vagisacks
cost $50, so... no.

09:52.027 --> 09:53.711
Speaking of money.

09:53.712 --> 09:54.779
Here.

09:54.780 --> 09:56.697
Someone's dilating.

09:56.698 --> 09:57.847
There she is.

09:57.866 --> 09:59.933
And time to swaddle the baby.

09:59.935 --> 10:01.619
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no... oh, God.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.120
Snug it up, now, snug it up.

10:03.121 --> 10:04.121
No.

10:05.457 --> 10:06.624
I shaved that part.

10:06.625 --> 10:08.376
You must have been very determined.

10:08.377 --> 10:09.400
Thank you.

10:09.411 --> 10:11.345
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

10:11.346 --> 10:13.404
We're gonna put
the hot wax on your legs.

10:13.415 --> 10:15.249
Uh-huh.
And then we put

10:15.250 --> 10:17.201
these strips on your legs
and pull them off.

10:17.235 --> 10:20.119
- Uh-huh.
- And it kind of hurts.

10:20.138 --> 10:21.238
Uh-huh-ah.

10:21.273 --> 10:23.374
- A lot.
- Dad!

10:23.375 --> 10:24.709
I don't know if I can do this.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.277
Dad, you have to do it with me.

10:26.311 --> 10:27.752
What? No, no way.

10:27.763 --> 10:29.263
Yes, it's like when you got

10:29.264 --> 10:31.005
that flu shot to show me it was okay.

10:31.033 --> 10:33.467
Yeah, that was brave of me, but...
Please?

10:33.468 --> 10:36.020
I know I act tough, but I'm not.

10:36.054 --> 10:37.705
Oh, my God...
the crying.

10:37.706 --> 10:38.889
Okay, I'll do it.

10:38.890 --> 10:39.957
Yay, scrotal wax.

10:39.958 --> 10:42.827
No, Gene, not scrotal, just leg.

10:42.828 --> 10:44.028
Oh, boo!

10:44.062 --> 10:45.296
Okay, everybody, role reversal.

10:45.297 --> 10:47.431
Louise, you're Linda now.

10:47.432 --> 10:50.301
And you're trying to get
your defiant daughter Louise

10:50.302 --> 10:53.319
to clean her room. Action.

10:53.338 --> 10:55.406
Role play's gonna cost you big.

10:55.407 --> 10:56.757
I'll pay for it when I see it.

10:56.758 --> 10:59.160
Hello. I'm Linda.

10:59.161 --> 11:02.396
♪ And I want you to clean your room ♪

11:02.397 --> 11:04.632

No-no-no-no.
No singing. Wha...?

11:10.789 --> 11:12.990
I'm doing you.
That's why I'm singing.

11:12.991 --> 11:15.793
You're doing me, so you don't sing.
Oh, like I'm not gonna sing!

11:15.794 --> 11:18.496

Okay, you two are done.
Big hand for Linda and Louise.

11:26.321 --> 11:27.938
Please sit down.
Great. You blew it.

11:27.973 --> 11:30.174
<i>I</i> blew it? You gave me
nothing out there!

11:30.175 --> 11:32.777
Well, nothing is what
you're getting paid for that!

11:32.811 --> 11:34.779
Whoa. Time out. Linda,
have you been paying

11:34.780 --> 11:37.014
your daughter to be here?
I'm sorry, Dakota,

11:37.015 --> 11:39.316
but it's the only way she'd do it.

11:39.317 --> 11:40.491
I'm a terrible mother.

11:40.519 --> 11:43.287
Oh, Linda, you really, really are.

11:43.321 --> 11:44.538
Everybody, everybody, listen, okay?

11:44.539 --> 11:46.497
Linda is a good mother.
Mwa.

11:46.508 --> 11:48.642
Because she did it out of love.

11:48.643 --> 11:50.778
And that puts you in the running for

11:50.779 --> 11:53.481
the Most Valuable Mommy award...
the MVM, everybody...

11:53.482 --> 11:55.999
which I give out at the end of the day.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.749
- All right!
- MVM!

11:57.750 --> 11:58.986
Pshh...

11:58.987 --> 12:01.055
And as for you, I don't feel like

12:01.056 --> 12:02.805
you're taking Modo Time seriously.

12:02.824 --> 12:04.307
Oh, no, not at all.

12:04.326 --> 12:06.142
And that makes me feel
negatively towards you.

12:06.161 --> 12:08.028
Well, maybe this will
help clear things up.

12:08.029 --> 12:10.798
Here's your seminar.
See it?

12:10.799 --> 12:12.983
It's so cute and nice
in my hand, and...

12:14.352 --> 12:16.170
Did you just fart on my seminar?

12:16.171 --> 12:17.505
Ye, me, too!

12:17.506 --> 12:18.806
Okay, that's... that's fine.

12:18.807 --> 12:20.823
I think I know what we need to do here.

12:21.860 --> 12:23.961
Hey! Watch it!
Get off me!

12:23.995 --> 12:26.564
You two will stay in there
until you're ready

12:26.565 --> 12:28.232
to engage in this experience!

12:28.233 --> 12:29.600
Oh, almost forgot.

12:29.601 --> 12:31.869
Oh, God.
What is that?

12:31.870 --> 12:33.771
It's <i>Freaky Friday</i> on a loop.

12:33.772 --> 12:36.056
Mom, you're old.
And you're young!

12:36.057 --> 12:38.109
Wouldn't it be crazy
if we switched bodies?

12:38.110 --> 12:39.967
No...!

12:42.047 --> 12:43.680
No...!

12:45.417 --> 12:46.617
Oh-hoo-hoo!

12:49.072 --> 12:51.485
Oh, no, we switched bodies!

12:51.486 --> 12:53.120
What a crazy journey we are on.

12:53.121 --> 12:55.489
The logic of this movie
is very unsettling!

12:55.490 --> 12:57.741
You can't do this, you monsters!

12:57.776 --> 12:59.510
All right, well,
why don't you two pair up

12:59.511 --> 13:00.978
now that your children are locked away?

13:01.012 --> 13:03.614
Of course, Dakota.
Come on, Cynthia.

13:03.615 --> 13:06.083
Let's you and me learn
some mommy skills together.

13:06.084 --> 13:07.484
I'd like that, Linda.

13:07.485 --> 13:09.053
And don't forget about

13:09.087 --> 13:10.988
that Most Valuable Mommy
award, everybody.

13:10.989 --> 13:12.623
It's a beautiful sash.

13:12.657 --> 13:13.991
- Huh. Huh.
- Hmm.

13:13.992 --> 13:15.676
- Hmm.
- Ah.

13:15.677 --> 13:18.178
I want that sash.
Over my dead body.

13:18.179 --> 13:20.447
I want that sash.
I love sashes.

13:22.050 --> 13:24.134
My legs are so free.

13:24.135 --> 13:26.019
Mmm. So that's what
air feels like.

13:26.054 --> 13:27.687
It's nice.

13:27.688 --> 13:29.206
Yeah, these pants feel incredible.

13:29.207 --> 13:30.958
Why don't all men do this?

13:30.959 --> 13:33.043
Hmph!
Gene, why are you making noises?

13:33.044 --> 13:34.528
They're my
jealousy noises! Ugh!

13:34.529 --> 13:35.879
What are you saying?

13:35.880 --> 13:38.165
I want to wax my legs, too!

13:38.166 --> 13:39.466
These ones right here!

13:39.467 --> 13:41.335
You don't even have leg hair.

13:41.336 --> 13:43.036
Tell that to my heart!

13:43.071 --> 13:44.888
Hold on, everybody.
We're making a U-turn.

13:44.889 --> 13:46.657
All right!

13:46.691 --> 13:49.810
Ow!
Gentle touch, Cynthia.

13:49.811 --> 13:51.345
A mother's gentle touch.

13:51.346 --> 13:53.547
I'm so sorry.

13:53.548 --> 13:55.516
You know, Dakota, when
I braid Louise's hair,

13:55.517 --> 13:58.051
I sing her a song.
Ah, yes, please.

13:58.086 --> 14:01.321
♪ Here goes the hair and
there goes the hair ♪ Ah...

14:01.322 --> 14:03.490
♪ And where is Harry Truman?

14:03.491 --> 14:06.059
♪ He's dead in the ground,
he's dead in the ground ♪

14:06.060 --> 14:09.146
♪ He's dead, dead,
dead... ♪ Ow! Ow!

14:09.180 --> 14:10.547
Well we switched bodies again,

14:10.548 --> 14:13.050
and everything's back to normal.

14:13.051 --> 14:14.685
I finally understand you, Mom.

14:14.686 --> 14:16.520
<i>Freaky Friday's</i> getting to me, man.

14:16.521 --> 14:18.088
They really understand each other!

14:18.089 --> 14:19.356
You pull yourself together.

14:19.357 --> 14:21.074
We got to get out of here.

14:21.075 --> 14:23.694
They just had to see things
from each other's perspective.

14:23.695 --> 14:25.245
Logan, come on!
We got to think!

14:25.246 --> 14:27.247
Walk a mile in each other's shoes...

14:27.248 --> 14:29.399
Oh, I swear to God,
if you keep talking,

14:29.400 --> 14:31.101
I'm gonna gut-punch you!

14:31.102 --> 14:33.670
It's a beautiful story
of love and acceptance.

14:33.671 --> 14:34.905
Oh, my stomach!

14:34.906 --> 14:36.590
Wait a minute.
That's it!

14:36.624 --> 14:39.126
Wow. See?
What'd I tell you?

14:39.127 --> 14:40.194
That is smooth.

14:40.195 --> 14:41.378
Whoa, whoa, Teddy.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.213
What, a little high up on the leg?

14:43.214 --> 14:44.548
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

14:44.549 --> 14:45.783
There's a stop sign right here.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.117
Now feel mine.
And mine.

14:47.118 --> 14:48.439
No, Teddy, don't touch their legs.

14:48.453 --> 14:50.187
Look at this.
Whoa!

14:50.221 --> 14:52.189
You could wash a pan with that.

14:52.223 --> 14:54.424
Hey, maybe I'll shoot over
there and get what you got.

14:54.425 --> 14:55.959
Yeah.
Nah, on second thought,

14:55.960 --> 14:57.594
I couldn't get rid
of these little guys.

14:57.595 --> 14:59.096
They're my little furry friends.

14:59.097 --> 15:01.131
Don't listen to him.
You're an embarrassment!

15:01.132 --> 15:03.100
No, don't listen to him.
You're all right.

15:03.134 --> 15:05.269
Furry little... friends?

15:07.205 --> 15:09.006
This is fun! Higher, Tina!

15:09.040 --> 15:11.708
Higher!

Watch out for that bear!
Whoo! Here comes a puma!

15:32.664 --> 15:33.964
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Mommy!

15:33.965 --> 15:35.766
Did you hear that, everybody?

15:35.767 --> 15:37.885
They're coming around.
The Uter-Room is working!

15:37.919 --> 15:41.738
Oh, that umbilical soup
got me, Mom. Got me real bad.

15:41.739 --> 15:43.006
Rub my tummy?

15:43.007 --> 15:44.508
Mine, too.

15:44.509 --> 15:46.677
Oh, my poor baby.

15:48.079 --> 15:49.680
It's wonderful.

15:49.681 --> 15:52.683
A mother's instinct
at its most primal level!

15:52.684 --> 15:54.418
Come, other mothers, come and see!

15:54.452 --> 15:56.920
Mommy's gonna make you all better.

15:56.921 --> 15:59.189
Well, this mommy's gonna
make you all better first.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.843
Now! Ha!

16:02.844 --> 16:05.178
What the hell's going on?
Uh, what are... what are you doing?

16:05.213 --> 16:07.347
You fell for the oldest trick
in the book.

16:07.348 --> 16:09.683
The fake tummy ache!
The old belly bluff.

16:09.717 --> 16:10.817
Oh, the belly bluff!

16:10.852 --> 16:12.119
Now, if you'll excuse us,

16:12.120 --> 16:13.520
us girls...

16:13.521 --> 16:15.155
Sorry. Ladies...
Thank you.

16:15.156 --> 16:17.057
Are going to play laser tag.
Whoo-hoo!

16:17.058 --> 16:20.491
Oh, I hope those lasers
hit you right in the butt!

16:24.962 --> 16:26.430
Come on, you!

16:26.431 --> 16:27.697
Damn these delicate shoulders!

16:27.698 --> 16:29.266
Let me try.

16:30.818 --> 16:33.086
Where'd you learn how
to break down a door,

16:33.087 --> 16:34.337
Girl Scout camp?
Move it.

16:40.478 --> 16:42.429
No covering your sensors.

16:42.430 --> 16:44.531
No climbing on the barriers.

16:44.532 --> 16:48.018
And no physical contact of any kind.

16:48.052 --> 16:49.719
Well, agree to disagree.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.023
I feel kind of bad about
locking our moms in that room.

16:54.025 --> 16:55.826
Ah, hey!

16:55.860 --> 16:57.294
<i>I killed them.</i>

16:57.328 --> 16:58.562
I killed them all.

16:58.563 --> 16:59.729
Tina, what...
what's wrong?

16:59.730 --> 17:01.331
I killed my friendly leg hairs.

17:01.332 --> 17:03.834
Um... oh.
Well, they'll grow back.

17:03.835 --> 17:05.635
It's not just that.

17:05.670 --> 17:07.204
I did it 'cause I was worried

17:07.204 --> 17:09.005
about what those girls
would think of me.

17:09.006 --> 17:10.840
I'm a sheep!
A hairless sheep!

17:10.875 --> 17:12.509
So you gave in to peer pressure.

17:12.510 --> 17:13.907
It happens to everybody.

17:13.911 --> 17:16.195
I mean, why do you think
I wear these shoes?

17:16.196 --> 17:18.047
'Cause you don't care
what you look like?

17:18.048 --> 17:19.566
What? No.
'Cause I... No.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.367
'Cause I saw some other
chefs wearing them

17:21.368 --> 17:22.836
and I thought they were cool.

17:22.837 --> 17:23.970
Don't you think?

17:23.971 --> 17:25.070
Yeah, yeah.

17:25.071 --> 17:26.506
What do you mean?

17:26.507 --> 17:28.191
I think they're...
Yeah, they're cool.

17:28.192 --> 17:30.060
Um... okay. Well, because
if they don't look...

17:30.061 --> 17:32.662
if they look stupid, I won't wear them.

17:32.663 --> 17:34.498
No, they... Yeah.
Forget it. Listen.

17:34.532 --> 17:36.433
Leg hair or no leg hair,
you're still Tina,

17:36.434 --> 17:38.268
and when it comes
to the important stuff,

17:38.269 --> 17:39.769
you'll make the right choice.

17:39.770 --> 17:41.204
Gene, put some pants on.

17:41.205 --> 17:42.305
- No!
- Ugh.

17:44.876 --> 17:46.190
What the hell?

17:46.210 --> 17:47.427
How'd you get out?

17:47.428 --> 17:49.262
I busted through the door.

17:49.263 --> 17:51.331
Um, <i>we</i> busted through the door.

17:51.332 --> 17:53.266
Fine. My shoulder
and Cynthia's left boob.

17:53.267 --> 17:55.502
All right, everybody.
Fun's over.

17:55.503 --> 17:57.201
Now, let's get back on Modo Time.

17:57.205 --> 17:58.889
Oh, no freaking way!

17:58.923 --> 18:01.725
You are coming back
to the Nurture Center right now!

18:01.726 --> 18:03.927
You're in big trouble,
Logan Berry Bush.

18:03.928 --> 18:04.928
Huh?

18:04.929 --> 18:06.213
Logan Berry Bush?

18:06.214 --> 18:07.614
We didn't think it through.

18:07.615 --> 18:08.748
Okay, everybody, calm down.

18:08.749 --> 18:10.350
Now, how do we get down there?

18:10.351 --> 18:12.736
No one goes in without
a vest and a laser gun.

18:12.737 --> 18:13.937
Well, that's not happening.

18:13.938 --> 18:15.472
I'll go down there!
Linda, no!

18:15.473 --> 18:16.740
Laser tag goes against

18:16.741 --> 18:18.742
everything we've been working on.

18:18.743 --> 18:20.043
And besides...
you're mothers.

18:20.044 --> 18:22.312
Uh-huh.
Where's mommy's gun?!

18:22.313 --> 18:23.914
So, welcome to the war.

18:23.915 --> 18:25.549
Okay, first, uh...
let's just try

18:25.550 --> 18:27.217
to create a dialogue, and we'll...

18:30.972 --> 18:32.789
You're gonna get it, Miss Missy!

18:32.807 --> 18:35.859
Why don't you let your gun
do the talking, blabbermouth!

18:35.893 --> 18:37.494
Blabbermouth?

18:44.785 --> 18:46.086
Linda, this isn't right!

18:46.120 --> 18:47.938
Feels pretty good to me!

18:47.972 --> 18:49.973
I am ordering you to put down your gun

18:49.974 --> 18:51.808
and go cradle your daughter!

18:51.809 --> 18:53.527
No! I'm gonna shoot her instead!

18:53.578 --> 18:55.111
Ha! Gotcha!

18:55.146 --> 18:57.514
I gave you that one!
Nah!

18:57.515 --> 18:59.082
This is seriously hurting your chances

18:59.083 --> 19:00.584
of receiving the MVM award!

19:00.618 --> 19:02.736
Maybe I should give
the sash to Cynthia, huh?

19:02.737 --> 19:04.304
Die, Logan!

19:04.628 --> 19:06.729
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa,
seriously? I'm the MVM?

19:06.764 --> 19:08.850
What?! The sash! Oh!

19:08.908 --> 19:10.775
That's for kidnapping me!

19:10.810 --> 19:12.543
Ooh! Aah!

19:12.578 --> 19:14.912
And that's for taking me
to <i>The Momgina Monologues!</i>

19:14.946 --> 19:17.447
You almost killed your mother.
I hope you're happy.

19:17.481 --> 19:19.249
I am.
Any last words?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.785
Yes. I just wish...

19:21.820 --> 19:24.464
I just wish you liked me, that's all.

19:24.584 --> 19:26.551
But I guess you never will,
so go ahead,

19:26.586 --> 19:27.748
put me out of my misery.

19:27.868 --> 19:30.279
Is this all 'cause you think
I don't like you?

19:30.399 --> 19:33.808
Go on. Just do it. Just go.
Take me out. Go ahead.

19:34.153 --> 19:37.810
Mom, I guess I've been
kind of a "B" word today.

19:37.930 --> 19:40.999
You have. But I came on
a little strong.

19:41.033 --> 19:42.601
I'm sorr...

19:42.635 --> 19:45.571
You! You ruined my beautiful
seminar, you little brat!

19:45.605 --> 19:47.572
And now you're gonna pay!

19:47.606 --> 19:50.207
Aah!
No! My baby!

19:50.242 --> 19:52.276
Suck on this soup tube, Dakota!

19:52.310 --> 19:54.245
It's laser-flavored!

19:54.365 --> 19:56.647
Mom, nice!

20:00.252 --> 20:01.753
Look north, Dakota.

20:01.787 --> 20:03.521
Whoa, Mom, amazing!

20:03.555 --> 20:05.022
Make my day!

20:05.056 --> 20:06.857
No, no, better before.

20:06.892 --> 20:08.425
Wait, wait. Hold on.

20:10.295 --> 20:11.528
Hey, get off the equipment!

20:11.562 --> 20:12.469
Oh, shove it!

20:12.589 --> 20:14.265
I'm bonding with my daughter!

20:14.299 --> 20:16.233
Yeah, we're bonding here!

20:17.668 --> 20:19.403
Best therapy ever.

20:19.437 --> 20:21.771
You should have seen the
way Mom took down Dakota.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.306
Phenomimom, my ass.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.345
My ass, too!
Up high!

20:25.465 --> 20:26.938
Yeah, that my girl!

20:27.058 --> 20:28.577
Quit scratching, you two.

20:28.612 --> 20:29.866
Can't help it.
It itches.

20:29.986 --> 20:31.580
Yeah, mine, too.
Switch?

20:31.615 --> 20:32.338
Okay.

20:33.869 --> 20:35.750
Come on.
Scratch like a man!

20:35.870 --> 20:36.718
Give it to me!

20:36.752 --> 20:38.553
Tina, I'm sorry I wasn't there

20:38.587 --> 20:40.122
to give you your first shave.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.925
It's okay.
I regretted it anyway.

20:42.959 --> 20:45.327
But it was fun going
to the waxing salon with Dad.

20:45.361 --> 20:46.594
He's a screamer.

20:46.629 --> 20:48.630
Ow, Gene!
Not so hard!

20:48.664 --> 20:51.161
Aw, man! Your day sounds better.
What?

20:51.281 --> 20:53.801
I want to go shave my legs
with Dad and then regret it.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.636
Yeah, let's make all the same mistakes

20:55.670 --> 20:56.971
with Dad again tomorrow!

20:57.005 --> 20:58.272
Okay.
Yay, Dad.

20:58.307 --> 20:59.840
Oh, screw all of you.

20:59.874 --> 21:01.605
Ah, Mom.
Come here.

21:01.874 --> 21:07.272
