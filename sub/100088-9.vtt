WEBVTT

00:07.529 --> 00:09.052
Previously onSEAL Team...DOCTOR: Given your age,

00:09.096 --> 00:11.489
there's a possibility you may
never resume your duties

00:11.533 --> 00:13.056
as Bravo Team leader.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.450
Jason's injury put me
in the hot seat.
Every day's a test.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.191
NATALIE:
All the skills the Navy
teaches its operators,

00:17.234 --> 00:18.975
they leave out
the most important one:

00:19.019 --> 00:20.455
how to ask for help.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.848
I can tell you what
the ambassador would've done

00:22.892 --> 00:24.676
if someone
forced an award on her.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.548
She would've used it.

00:26.591 --> 00:27.766
You almost got yourself killed.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.900
I'm okay.You are such a jackass, Sonny.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.990
JASON:
I look to the future,
and I don't see anything.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.514
It all just looks
so empty to me.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.823
This is what we were warned of.

00:40.866 --> 00:44.087
This is what was foretold.

00:44.131 --> 00:47.177
The Lord said their flesh
will rot away

00:47.221 --> 00:50.963
while they're standing,
and their eyes shall rot away.

00:51.007 --> 00:54.271
Their tongues shall rot away
inside their mouths.

00:54.315 --> 00:58.188
The Lord said there will be
a plague of blood.

00:58.232 --> 01:01.931
The stench of death
will rise from every village.

01:01.974 --> 01:02.975
Sinners will be besieged

01:03.019 --> 01:05.761
by this plague,
and the Lord's wrath

01:05.804 --> 01:07.806
will be like fire
across the land.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.808
He will make this curse
cling to you...

01:09.852 --> 01:13.551
It'd be nice if he threw in
sports and weather now and then.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.031
[chuckles]
DOOMSAYER:
...blood in the sea...

01:15.075 --> 01:17.729
Latest numbers from
the other villages.

01:17.773 --> 01:21.037
Fatality rates are
holding steady.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.301
What passes as good news
in an Ebola outbreak.

01:24.345 --> 01:27.739
[chuckles][clattering outside]

01:27.783 --> 01:29.306
You hear that?

01:29.350 --> 01:32.048
I think Mr. Microphone
finally ran out of double-As.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.832
[screams]Stay down!

01:33.876 --> 01:34.833
Stay down!

01:36.052 --> 01:39.882
My man, you move,
I'll cut you open!

01:41.710 --> 01:43.712
â™ª

01:51.807 --> 01:54.853
Let's go. Get that beer going.First round's on me
as we celebrate

01:54.897 --> 01:56.942
my friend's return
to his rightful place:

01:56.986 --> 01:59.031
beside us at a bar.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.425
Hey, I never seen a man so happy
three weeks after

02:01.469 --> 02:03.688
having a bladed implement
jabbed into his nutsack.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.995
Bladed implement
never stood a chance, Sonny.[chuckles]

02:06.038 --> 02:08.128
CLAY: How long till
you're cleared hot, brother?

02:08.171 --> 02:11.566
Next Monday, doctor clears me,
and it's go time.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.915
Cheers to that, boys.Oh, yeah.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.917
All right, really, though.
You're healing up quick.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.093
What's the secret?There is no secret.
You work hard. Drink your beer.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.877
Come on.I think I know
what the secret is.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.488
What's the secret?This doctor.

02:20.531 --> 02:21.967
She put a little
healing spell on you.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.318
I-I think what's really
healing him so fast

02:24.361 --> 02:26.189
is the magic of three weeks away

02:26.233 --> 02:28.148
from this little Texas
river cricket over here.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.802
[all laughing]

02:30.846 --> 02:33.109
DAVIS: So, four-day leave
starts tomorrow.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.372
I'm gonna
go see my sister.Oh.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.939
In Jersey.
Nice.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.942
Yeah.
That's good.
Good you guys are-are talking.

02:39.985 --> 02:42.510
Trying to patch things up.Little bit.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.990
You know...
work gets rough.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.818
Mm-hmm.
Need to vent.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.125
Ronnie's a good listener.Listen,

02:49.169 --> 02:52.128
it's always good to
have someone like that.Yeah.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.912
Hey, you know
what I was thinking?

02:53.956 --> 02:56.001
Maybe I'd just
push my trip a day.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.264
You and I could hang out.Mm.

02:57.307 --> 02:59.483
Like old times?Mm. Mm-hmm-hmm.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.485
Friends?
Friends.
Yes, of course.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.313
[chuckling]:
You know, like...Yeah. You see...

03:03.357 --> 03:05.315
The way it used to be?Yeah, the way
it used to be, of course.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.361
That was good stuff.Yeah, it was.
Yeah, just hard

03:07.404 --> 03:10.233
to go back to, uh...
just friends

03:10.277 --> 03:12.235
when-when the good times--
when a decent

03:12.279 --> 03:14.890
portion of those
have been

03:14.933 --> 03:17.066
moved to the bedroom.Those were

03:17.109 --> 03:19.024
fun times, too.

03:19.068 --> 03:22.027
Yeah. Listen, Lisa, uh,

03:22.071 --> 03:24.073
you were right to end this.

03:24.116 --> 03:26.293
Ain't no way for
us to be all in

03:26.336 --> 03:27.685
while we're on Bravo.

03:27.729 --> 03:31.472
You know, and...
I just, uh...

03:31.515 --> 03:34.257
I just don't want to fool
with anything less.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.041
Not with you, anyway.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.609
Yeah. Hey.

03:38.653 --> 03:41.046
It was a crazy idea.Yeah. Well, listen...

03:41.090 --> 03:43.266
Have yourself a
good weekend.
Thank you.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.095
Right.Okay. And, uh...

03:46.138 --> 03:48.140
just because...

03:48.184 --> 03:51.753
you know, we're done...

03:51.796 --> 03:54.190
don't mean you can't hang
with the-the team, you know?

03:54.234 --> 03:57.193
Come on.
Do some shots.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.456
I'll see you.See you.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.342
What's up?
Where you going?

04:15.385 --> 04:17.648
Is the old Officers' Club
popping off tonight or what?

04:17.692 --> 04:19.041
Two-for-one
champagne shooters?

04:19.084 --> 04:21.173
I wouldn't know, you know,
it's not my scene.

04:21.217 --> 04:22.305
No, your scene's
right here with us.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.045
It's been forever
since we hung out.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.265
Things change.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.309
What, because you're
an officer now?

04:26.353 --> 04:28.833
Blackburn's an officer.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.792
It's not the same.
You know that.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.663
Yeah, I also know it's not
the same without you around.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.057
Yeah, nothing is the same.
I get it. I know.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.058
I'll see you later, sucker.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.189
All right.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.017
RAY:
Give this man a shot.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.024
[all laughing]

04:46.068 --> 04:47.591
CONNERS:
So how was it
seeing the guys?

04:47.635 --> 04:49.114
That was the first time
in a while, right?
Ha!

04:49.158 --> 04:50.202
It was great.
I'll tell you what,

04:50.246 --> 04:51.421
it was a lot of fun.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.075
We had a blast.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.990
One of my boys,
he actually ended up

04:55.033 --> 04:56.861
scrapping with a possum.[bangs on table]

04:56.905 --> 04:58.254
In the parking lot.Hmm.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.997
I, uh, I imagine
that would be Sonny.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.564
Sonny, Sonny,
I'll tell you what--

05:03.607 --> 05:06.393
now, if you want a real project,
he's your man.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.177
You talk to any
of your teammates

05:08.220 --> 05:09.178
about what happened
to you?

05:09.221 --> 05:11.833
Your, uh,
your panic attacks?

05:13.487 --> 05:15.140
JASON: What?CONNERS:
Your panic attacks.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.055
Did you talk to any
of your teammates about 'em?

05:17.099 --> 05:19.057
Why would I do that?

05:19.101 --> 05:21.190
It's not worth my while.
That wasn't me.That wasn't you?

05:21.233 --> 05:23.366
No, it wasn't me.Who do you think
that was, then?

05:23.410 --> 05:26.326
I spun out for a second.
I spun out.

05:26.369 --> 05:29.111
The thought of someone cutting
into me didn't sit well

05:29.154 --> 05:31.679
with me, Doc.
Got a little agita, you know?

05:31.722 --> 05:33.463
Jason, come on.Come on, what?

05:33.507 --> 05:34.769
Well, I think
guys like me

05:34.812 --> 05:36.161
quiver at the thought
of surgery,

05:36.205 --> 05:38.033
but not, but not you.
You're Captain America.

05:38.076 --> 05:41.210
[scoffs]You dodge bombs and bullets
for a living.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.126
So the thought of you
or the notion of you

05:44.169 --> 05:45.780
freaking out over
a little outpatient surgery

05:45.823 --> 05:47.303
doesn't, uh,
doesn't track for me.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.131
I'm just telling you
what happened here.

05:49.174 --> 05:52.134
But you've undergone
procedures before.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.962
Fourteen.

05:54.005 --> 05:57.182
Your second panic attack
was after your surgery,

05:57.226 --> 05:58.793
is that correct?

05:58.836 --> 06:01.186
So don't tell me you were
spun out by a procedure

06:01.230 --> 06:02.623
you'd already
undergone.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.800
If your surgery
hadn't been done right...

06:05.843 --> 06:09.064
your career might've been over,
is that correct?

06:09.107 --> 06:11.458
I'm just asking, might--
might that be the trigger?

06:11.501 --> 06:12.633
Oh...

06:12.676 --> 06:16.114
[takes deep breath]

06:16.158 --> 06:18.856
I just lost it for a second.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.423
Yeah.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.512
But everything's
getting back to normal.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.514
Back to normal or back
to the way you like it?

06:24.558 --> 06:26.821
[exhales]
The way I like it.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.954
What is...?
You got a problem with that?

06:29.998 --> 06:31.869
I mean, I can see it
on your face

06:31.913 --> 06:34.176
that you have
a problem with that.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.615
So what do we,
what do we do here?

06:38.659 --> 06:41.139
What's the point?
What-what am I doing here?

06:41.183 --> 06:42.663
We talk.
"We talk."

06:42.706 --> 06:44.447
[chuckles]
We talk?

06:44.491 --> 06:46.275
We've been talking, so...

06:46.318 --> 06:50.105
[exhales] Why don't you just
tell me what my problem is?

06:50.148 --> 06:53.456
And we fix it.I-I wish it was that simple.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.327
Do you, do you think
it's that simple?

06:55.371 --> 06:56.894
I mean, coming from a man
like you,

06:56.938 --> 06:58.461
who's got all these books
around them?

06:58.505 --> 07:02.204
And your experience?
I would say that's very simple.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.902
It's not really how I do things.[sighs] How do you do things?

07:04.946 --> 07:06.643
Well, my-my 30,000-foot read

07:06.687 --> 07:09.385
is that you're suffering
from a form of anxiety.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.082
[exhales]The obvious culprit
being trauma.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.389
Trauma. Duh,
that would be war, Doc.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.521
Well, sure.Yeah.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.740
Sure. But I define trauma
as the assault

07:16.784 --> 07:18.263
of the unimaginable.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.004
So, losing a teammate

07:20.048 --> 07:22.398
or suddenly and tragically
becoming a single parent.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.054
An unforeseen face-to-face
with the possibility

07:26.097 --> 07:27.838
of never leading
Bravo Team again.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.274
How we gonna work the problem?

07:29.318 --> 07:31.755
How are yougonna
work the problem?

07:31.799 --> 07:33.583
I have to
really understand

07:33.627 --> 07:35.585
what's happening, Jason.
And the only way I know

07:35.629 --> 07:38.196
how to unpack that
is to talk to you.Talk?

07:38.240 --> 07:40.634
Again, it's talk.
Talk, talk, talk!

07:40.677 --> 07:42.984
Got to justify the hundred
dollars you're paying.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.420
JASON:
It's a lot of talking.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.814
And I'm not
getting anything, really.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.903
I can't seem to
really help you out,

07:48.946 --> 07:51.122
because I don't think
you want to be helped.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.559
You know,
Wayne Gretzky said,

07:52.602 --> 07:54.648
"You miss 100%
of the shots you don't take."

07:54.691 --> 07:58.521
That's great. Use the sports
metaphors to get into my head.

07:58.565 --> 08:04.048
While I sit here on the, what,
$100-an-hour couch?

08:04.092 --> 08:05.833
You're welcome.Thank you.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.010
"Talk."

08:10.446 --> 08:12.056
[clears throat]

08:13.536 --> 08:16.365
[phone ringing]

08:16.408 --> 08:18.106
CLAY:
Ignore it.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.455
REBECCA: No, I can't.Ignore it, come on.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.717
[chuckling]: I can't.Come on.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.023
[ringing continues]REBECCA: You never know

08:22.066 --> 08:25.113
what kind of dire
emergency might arise.

08:25.156 --> 08:29.552
Like a 2:00 a.m. booty call
from a lonely bar-closing soul.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.120
A booty call?Yeah.

08:32.163 --> 08:35.950
Yeah, that was more like
a lifeline saving you

08:35.993 --> 08:38.779
from some stuffy
D.C. flesh-pressing.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.911
Well, I could get used
to your version

08:40.955 --> 08:42.522
of flesh-pressing,
even if you were

08:42.565 --> 08:43.827
a little flingy
with my shirt.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.220
Can you find it for me?

08:48.484 --> 08:53.315
[exhales] Oh, speaking
of Washington, I have

08:53.358 --> 08:54.838
a work event on Saturday night--

08:54.882 --> 08:59.060
Congressional Wine Caucus;
do you want to be my plus-one?

08:59.103 --> 09:00.583
The whole world's going to hell

09:00.627 --> 09:02.150
and Congress is worried
about wine?

09:02.193 --> 09:05.240
Well, I listen to the minority
whip drone about pinot,

09:05.283 --> 09:07.372
and he might
back the security bill

09:07.416 --> 09:08.722
my boss is pushing.

09:09.766 --> 09:14.554
No. I'm gonna take a pass.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.469
This town can't even get drunk
without ulterior motives.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.820
Yeah. But if you don't
work the machine,

09:19.863 --> 09:21.125
the machine will work you.

09:22.387 --> 09:23.867
Has anyone ever considered
taking a blowtorch

09:23.911 --> 09:25.390
to the machine?

09:25.434 --> 09:27.567
It usually doesn't end well.

09:28.611 --> 09:29.873
You know, I've been...

09:29.917 --> 09:34.486
hearing some rumbles...

09:34.530 --> 09:36.488
Ambassador Marsden?
People are starting

09:36.532 --> 09:38.534
to question her decisions
in Yemen.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.318
What is there to question?

09:40.362 --> 09:42.669
I mean, she sacrificed herself
to try and bring peace.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.932
Right, it's just...Just what?
Just the machine?

09:44.975 --> 09:46.281
What, they can't stand a hero?
Someone who actually

09:46.324 --> 09:49.066
shot straight
and fought for good?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.590
Politicians gonna slice that up
into their own angles?

09:50.633 --> 09:53.680
I don't know.
It's just talk.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.507
And it's a good bet
someone's trying

09:55.551 --> 09:56.987
to cover their asses.

09:57.031 --> 10:00.034
[phone vibrating]

10:02.602 --> 10:05.517
Work?
Yeah.

10:05.561 --> 10:08.477
The machine beckons.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.522
ERIC:
You're looking at
Sinoe, Liberia.

10:10.566 --> 10:13.613
[man shouts][woman whimpering]

10:13.656 --> 10:15.919
Cut you open!

10:17.921 --> 10:19.357
ERIC:
The man with the machete

10:19.401 --> 10:20.924
is Dioh Morlu.
He's the self-appointed

10:20.968 --> 10:23.318
commander of
the Holy Vengeance Militia.

10:23.361 --> 10:27.235
Folks he's terrorizing are
Aid Corps International workers

10:27.278 --> 10:29.541
trying to contain the worst
Ebola outbreak

10:29.585 --> 10:31.413
the region has seen
in years.

10:31.456 --> 10:32.675
And those boxes
they're stealing?

10:32.719 --> 10:35.504
Vaccine that has shown
promising results

10:35.547 --> 10:37.245
in combatting
the disease.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.247
Ripping off Ebola meds
from people in need's

10:39.290 --> 10:40.422
about as cold as it gets.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.380
Stepping right into
a zombie apocalypse.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.556
ERIC:
Vaccines fetch a high price

10:44.600 --> 10:46.428
on the black market.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.430
Hoarding them
gives Dioh Morlu

10:48.473 --> 10:50.519
more power in the region.While prolonging the epidemic.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.651
Exactly.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.827
So far,
Morlu and his men

10:53.870 --> 10:55.480
have hit a dozen
medical aid teams.

10:55.524 --> 10:59.223
They've killed two doctors who
wouldn't give up their cargo.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.791
We're spinning up
to protect these aid workers

11:01.835 --> 11:04.576
and their mission.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.622
Tier One on
a humanitarian mission?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.580
[chuckles] I mean,
does it seem a little strange

11:08.624 --> 11:09.843
to anybody else?

11:09.886 --> 11:11.888
ERIC:
Clearly, the brass
has its reasons.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.455
CLAY:
Why don't we
go in there

11:13.498 --> 11:15.326
and just fricking schwack
this clown Morlu

11:15.370 --> 11:17.720
instead of giving the
State Department a photo op?

11:17.764 --> 11:20.462
I mean, sure, protecting this
medication's a worthy cause,

11:20.505 --> 11:22.725
worthy mission, but it's not
gonna solve anything long-term.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.249
Well, maybe this will help you
ease your frustration:

11:25.293 --> 11:28.383
while we are not to target
Morlu, if you cross paths

11:28.426 --> 11:30.733
with him or his men,
standard ROEs apply.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.169
You can engage.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.869
But our primary objective
is ensuring the aid workers'

11:35.912 --> 11:38.132
ability to
do their job safely.

11:38.175 --> 11:42.266
This outbreak-- the reports here
say that it's a new strain?

11:42.310 --> 11:43.572
Possibly airborne?

11:43.615 --> 11:45.705
That's correct.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.532
Morlu's army is
only one concern.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.752
The larger concern
is a battlefield

11:49.796 --> 11:51.275
where the air itself

11:51.319 --> 11:52.624
will be trying
to kill you.

12:03.026 --> 12:06.595
[panting]

12:10.860 --> 12:13.080
All right, Jason,
that's time.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.041
Jason.
[panting]

12:18.085 --> 12:20.565
You got a little extra
fire this morning?

12:20.609 --> 12:21.784
Yeah, you know what?

12:21.828 --> 12:23.351
Adrenaline's pumping.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.745
Plus, I got this creeper,
you know, staring at my ass.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.443
Oh. Actually, I'm trying
to check your form.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.227
Ooh! Ooh!

12:30.271 --> 12:31.794
You're violating my space!

12:31.838 --> 12:33.970
[both laughing]

12:34.014 --> 12:35.580
You sure this extra energy
doesn't have something to do

12:35.624 --> 12:37.234
with Bravo getting spun up?

12:37.278 --> 12:39.280
Don't like when they're
operating outside the wire

12:39.323 --> 12:42.413
without me, so...

12:42.457 --> 12:43.850
it's got to be the last time
this happens.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.242
I'm surprised you didn't try

12:45.286 --> 12:46.809
to get cleared early.Might've tried.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.420
Doctor couldn't see me
till Monday.

12:49.464 --> 12:52.293
When did you become
so accepting?

12:52.336 --> 12:53.816
I just don't want
to risk missing

12:53.860 --> 12:55.513
more than this op.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.472
Some pain-in-the-ass
physiologist told me that.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.690
She sounds brilliant.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.692
Could be.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.826
Let's talk about your diet.Don't you want to

13:03.870 --> 13:05.306
talk about my ass some more?Mm,

13:05.349 --> 13:07.308
we'll get back to that.All right, so it's tasteless,

13:07.351 --> 13:08.744
it's, like, green;
when I do eat it,

13:08.788 --> 13:10.833
I feel like I'm eating dirt.
It's horrible.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.400
Yeah, yeah,
eating plant-based does not

13:12.443 --> 13:13.967
have to make you miserable.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.360
Look, okay,
there is a new

13:16.404 --> 13:17.579
vegan place that I saw
over on Richmond,

13:17.622 --> 13:18.754
you should check it out.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.584
[coughs]
Vegan restaurant?

13:22.627 --> 13:24.151
Actually, just the whole
thought of it...

13:24.194 --> 13:25.674
It's gonna be impossible

13:25.717 --> 13:27.937
for anyone to convince me
to have an Impossible Burger.

13:27.981 --> 13:30.592
Yeah, I really appreciate
how open-minded you are

13:30.635 --> 13:32.376
about all this.
It's commendable.All right.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.638
Come on.
I wouldn't even know

13:33.682 --> 13:35.597
what to order if I was at
a vegan restaurant.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.555
How about this?
How about, uh,

13:37.599 --> 13:40.167
why don't you come with me?
Help me navigate the, uh,

13:40.210 --> 13:43.387
the meatless menu?You want me to come with you?

13:43.431 --> 13:45.128
Uh, yeah.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.738
CONNERS:
Well, that must have
felt risky.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.176
Risky? Risky, how?

13:49.219 --> 13:50.960
Well, asking out the woman
who's guiding your recovery,

13:51.004 --> 13:52.527
what if she had turned you down?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.094
You know, it's those type of
awkward moments

13:54.137 --> 13:55.791
that keep me in business.You got to be kidding me.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.749
She's overseeing my therapy,
all right?

13:57.793 --> 13:59.142
It's just "lunch." Okay?

13:59.186 --> 14:00.883
Not a date.Come on, Jason,

14:00.927 --> 14:03.973
I don't think guys like you
ever do anything without intent.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.802
You know what? The last time
I asked a girl out

14:06.846 --> 14:08.151
on a proper date,

14:08.195 --> 14:10.675
Randall Cunningham
was the quarterback, yeah.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.591
Can I offer an alternate theory?

14:13.635 --> 14:15.071
Ah, you know what?
No, it wasn't Cunningham.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.507
It wasn't, you know?

14:16.551 --> 14:18.335
It was Ty Detmer. That's who
it was, and he sucked.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.728
Well, you can deflect
all you want,

14:19.771 --> 14:22.949
but the last times Natalie
saw you away from work,

14:22.992 --> 14:26.082
you were all whacked out
in a-a compromised state.

14:26.126 --> 14:29.259
I... Wow.So maybe you wanted to
erase that perception

14:29.303 --> 14:31.479
now that you are on the mend
physically and mentally.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.307
[chuckling]: You're overthinking
all this. You really are.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.961
Kind of what
I get paid to do.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.180
Yeah.Well, you can't deny

14:37.224 --> 14:38.442
you only started hanging out
with your teammates again

14:38.486 --> 14:40.009
when you were back
to your old self.

14:40.053 --> 14:43.795
Normal, as you say.That's not how my
mind works, okay?

14:43.839 --> 14:45.841
I'm not looking at
all the angles that way.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.278
I imagine that your mind
must work that way

14:48.322 --> 14:50.193
on the battlefield.We're not on
the battlefield.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.586
Are you sure?

14:51.629 --> 14:53.283
[sighs]

14:53.327 --> 14:56.069
All right, so I take it
this is the old wagon train

14:56.112 --> 14:57.722
we're gonna be
protecting here, huh?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.115
Yeah, correct.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.813
We'll, uh, be escorting them
to the village of Yadro.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.294
There's a recent
outbreak there.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.253
We head out in an hour.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.298
It's a hot zone,
so you already know,

15:08.342 --> 15:09.691
full CBRN coverage.

15:09.734 --> 15:10.692
Yes, it sucks.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.346
The disease is fast-acting,

15:12.389 --> 15:14.348
so be mindful of your MOPP gear.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.479
Keep an eye on
your suit's integrity,

15:15.523 --> 15:17.960
and watch
each other's as well.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.353
Yeah, and if the suit tears?

15:19.396 --> 15:22.356
We'll evac back here for decon.SONNY: And then

15:22.399 --> 15:24.010
you change your skivvies.

15:24.053 --> 15:27.187
CLAY: Let's add one more to the
list of Sonny's little phobias.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.232
SONNY: Hell yeah
I'm afraid of that Ebola.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.712
Heard this one has teeth, man.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.149
It's like the shark
of viruses.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.499
Well, you know, it's better off
to just not get exposed.

15:35.543 --> 15:39.721
'Cause if we do, we're gonna be
quarantined here for weeks, man.

15:39.764 --> 15:42.202
What's got you eyeing the clock?
You got a hot date?

15:42.245 --> 15:44.552
SONNY: Oh, Miss Mandy,
if I'd known you were coming,

15:44.595 --> 15:47.337
I would have shared
a cab to the airport.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.383
Guys, this is Dr. Alice Lizer,

15:49.426 --> 15:53.169
she's one of the Agency's
chem-bio geniuses.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.780
Dr. Lizer,
Senior Chief Perry.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.304
Okay.I'm not big on handshakes--

15:57.347 --> 16:00.046
things I've seen
through a microscope.

16:00.089 --> 16:01.525
What's the, uh, what's
the Agency doing here?

16:01.569 --> 16:03.005
I thought this was just
a naturally occurring

16:03.049 --> 16:04.441
viral outbreak.

16:04.485 --> 16:07.531
The U.S. maintains strategic
resources in the area.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.359
Airstrips, ports.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.144
If the locals
lose faith in us

16:11.187 --> 16:13.015
because we can't stop
the epidemic,

16:13.059 --> 16:14.712
we lose our foothold.

16:14.756 --> 16:17.106
A lot riding on some
kindhearted med students.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.326
MANDY:
And the assets chosen
to watch their backs.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.676
So, Doc, when you bag
this Ebola,

16:21.719 --> 16:24.287
you, uh, gonna mount it
on your office wall?

16:24.331 --> 16:26.637
As an infectious disease expert,
this is like

16:26.681 --> 16:28.683
the Hannibal Lecter of viruses.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.338
Now, if it's an airborne strain,
studying it will have

16:31.381 --> 16:33.209
implications for biodefense.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.995
Dr. Lizer will travel with you
to collect samples.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.431
I'm gonna go grab my gear.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.869
SONNY:
Hey, Doc, does hand sanitizer
work, truly?

16:40.912 --> 16:42.305
Gives me dry skin.

16:42.349 --> 16:46.048
Yo... what's, uh,
what's got your head spinning?

16:46.092 --> 16:48.355
An outbreak could
last for months.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.357
There's no way they
keep us here that long.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.142
So what are we
really here for?

16:53.186 --> 16:56.189
Endgame is not
our problem, Clay.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.278
Let's focus on the job,
get this work done.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.280
All right?

17:00.323 --> 17:01.324
Come on, man.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.329
Bravo 1.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.722
Trent.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.475
Oh, wow.There you go.

17:21.518 --> 17:22.606
Would you look at that.Oh, man.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.435
That doesn't look bad.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.395
You managed to sniff out all of
the saturated fat on the menu.

17:28.438 --> 17:31.441
That is commendable.Mm-hmm.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.008
It's not bad, right?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.401
[mouth full]:
Yeah, it's good.

17:34.444 --> 17:38.057
Tell you what, if I...

17:38.100 --> 17:40.407
if I jogged from
J-Bad to Kandahar,

17:40.450 --> 17:42.278
my sweat socks would
taste better than this.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.410
Not melodramatic at all.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.064
Oh, no?Not in the least, no.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.414
Like, Virginia Beach,
how's that treating you?

17:47.457 --> 17:49.633
Mm. I don't know.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.027
The view from my office is
pretty similar to San Diego.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.334
I still need to find
a great place to go

17:54.377 --> 17:57.119
for a long run
so I can clear my head.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.121
Yeah.
I mean, it's...

17:59.165 --> 18:01.254
it's kind of a necessity,
given all the time

18:01.297 --> 18:03.038
I'm spending with you.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.519
All right. There's a lot of
good runs around the beach.

18:05.562 --> 18:08.043
Maybe I'll go this weekend.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.349
Yeah.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.441
How you doing with
the team away this time?

18:14.484 --> 18:17.792
Have you had any more mishaps
with inanimate objects

18:17.835 --> 18:19.315
in your apartment?

18:19.359 --> 18:21.839
That inanimate object
had it coming to it.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.320
Let me tell you,
it lost, I won.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.714
You seem more at ease
with the boys gone this time.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.195
Yeah, I just, uh, want to
get back to operating.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.500
That's all that matters
to me right now.

18:30.544 --> 18:33.024
It's nice having something
you love so much.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.374
We're both lucky that way.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.984
I love what I do.
I love my work.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.420
That's all that matters.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.030
What about you?

18:39.074 --> 18:41.424
How'd you, uh,
get into physiology?

18:41.468 --> 18:45.385
I was carrying the puck
across the blue line

18:45.428 --> 18:49.084
when a Wolverine defenseman
hit me knee-on-knee

18:49.128 --> 18:51.782
and blew out my ACL.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.350
Kind of sucks when
something you love

18:54.394 --> 18:56.439
just gets torn away
from you, doesn't it?

18:56.483 --> 18:58.572
Yeah, it does.Mm-hmm.

18:58.615 --> 18:59.790
My playing days were over,

18:59.834 --> 19:03.751
but the rehab process hooked me.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.014
I got my masters
in physiology,

19:06.057 --> 19:08.364
and, uh...

19:08.408 --> 19:11.150
I fell in love again.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.500
And getting people back
to doing what they love

19:13.543 --> 19:16.416
is so much more of a rush
than anything I ever got

19:16.459 --> 19:17.765
playing hockey.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.419
What about you?

19:19.462 --> 19:22.900
Did you always know
you wanted to be a SEAL?

19:22.944 --> 19:24.511
Love being a SEAL.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.730
Can't think of anything
else I'd want to do.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.429
[entry bells jingle]

19:33.041 --> 19:34.260
Hi, sis.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.000
Hey, Ronnie.
Hey.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.396
[Ronnie chuckles]

19:40.440 --> 19:41.571
[chuckles nervously]Uh, yeah.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.747
[Davis clears throat]

19:43.791 --> 19:46.141
I hope this place is okay.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.535
Suburban Jersey, not quite
a dining hotbed.

19:48.578 --> 19:50.232
No, it's good, it's good.

19:50.276 --> 19:53.279
It's just, um, up the road
from my hotel, so...

19:53.322 --> 19:55.237
Sorry about that.

19:55.281 --> 19:56.543
I was all excited

19:56.586 --> 19:57.979
to have you at the house,

19:58.022 --> 19:59.763
meet Dave and the kids,

19:59.807 --> 20:02.897
but this stomach bug
they've all got...Understood.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.377
It's totally fine.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.117
This is a cute town.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.510
I see why you like it.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.512
Close enough to the city
for Dave's job,

20:09.556 --> 20:11.427
and the schools
are wonderful.

20:11.471 --> 20:14.169
That's good.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.518
Have you eaten here before?

20:15.562 --> 20:17.999
Uh, food's decent.
Oh.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.218
[both laugh]

20:19.261 --> 20:20.784
The apple pie is
what it's all about.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.917
Is it as good as
Aunt Joanie's apple pie?

20:22.960 --> 20:24.701
Do you remember
the way she made it?

20:24.745 --> 20:26.181
She would, like,
drizzle that, um,

20:26.225 --> 20:28.662
that caramel drizzle
on the top of it.

20:28.705 --> 20:31.752
I... wish I remembered that.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.536
She was sweet, and...

20:35.451 --> 20:40.021
And we had good
times, too, Ronnie.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.588
Before everything.

20:41.631 --> 20:46.027
I'm glad you're here, Lisa.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.205
Me, too.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.875
If it were up to me,
I'd rather Morlu and his men

21:07.918 --> 21:10.269
just ambush us out here
in the open, man,

21:10.312 --> 21:12.967
instead of waiting till
we get to this village.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.534
Smoke 'em on the highway,

21:14.577 --> 21:16.710
save people more blood and guts.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.364
Maybe they don't
attack at all.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.669
That'd be ideal.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.758
Yeah, we're real good
at avoiding conflict.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.064
Real good.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.849
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.547
We're two klicks out
from the village,

21:27.590 --> 21:29.375
break, interrogative:

21:29.418 --> 21:30.854
do you have visual on us?

21:30.898 --> 21:32.334
That's a good copy, 1.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.945
I have both you
and the village on ISR.

21:34.989 --> 21:37.905
Not a lot going on right now.
A few small vehicles in and out.

21:37.948 --> 21:40.734
No indication of enemy activity.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.388
RAY:
I'll take that.

21:42.431 --> 21:44.390
Bravo 1 out.

21:45.521 --> 21:47.784
What do we got here?

21:52.615 --> 21:54.530
What's this guy doing?

21:54.574 --> 21:57.185
LIZER:
What they've been told to do.

21:57.228 --> 22:01.232
Destroy all the possessions
of the infected.

22:01.276 --> 22:04.758
VIC:
Whole life burned up
on the side of the road.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.847
Awful.

22:14.245 --> 22:16.204
Hey, you want to go
for a run this weekend?

22:16.247 --> 22:17.988
[chuckles]Show me the local trails,

22:18.032 --> 22:19.903
if you can keep up with me.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.862
Wow, if I can keep up
with you, huh?

22:21.905 --> 22:24.517
Tell you what, I'd like to,
but I got something.

22:26.519 --> 22:29.348
My, uh, my daughter,
she's coming back from college.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.481
Thanks again for lunch.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.309
Was not my choice.
Mm.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.616
I am never gonna live that down.No, you're not.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.618
CONNERS:
So how did it feel
being with her?

22:38.661 --> 22:41.272
It was good, you know.
She's on my side.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.883
Getting you back to operating?

22:42.926 --> 22:44.319
Yeah.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.669
You speak highly of her.Do I?

22:46.713 --> 22:48.845
You're here because of her.I wouldn't say that.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.151
You're kind of
stretching it now.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.022
That's what you told me.

22:52.066 --> 22:55.635
Let's see, Natalie's words were:

22:55.678 --> 22:57.637
"All the skills the Navy
teaches operators,

22:57.680 --> 22:59.421
"they leave out
the most important one:

22:59.465 --> 23:00.553
how to ask for help."

23:00.596 --> 23:01.684
Well...

23:01.728 --> 23:03.425
At lunch, you-you felt
nothing more?

23:03.469 --> 23:06.646
What do you want me to say?

23:06.689 --> 23:08.822
Huh?

23:08.865 --> 23:11.694
She's fun,
she's-she's always happy.

23:11.738 --> 23:14.044
She's great to be around.
I mean, she passes the time.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.611
Did you want to sleep with her?

23:15.655 --> 23:19.615
Doc, you are aware of
how the male species

23:19.659 --> 23:21.269
operates, right?

23:21.312 --> 23:24.141
So you did.
Just sex.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.143
Just sex.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.841
And if you're
doing it right...

23:27.884 --> 23:31.061
ooh, wow, it feels pretty good.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.760
Did you feel guilty?Guilty about what?

23:33.803 --> 23:36.763
I'm just wondering if
your wife crossed your mind.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.898
My wife's dead.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.859
I don't want to talk about her.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.077
'Cause it's too painful?

23:47.121 --> 23:50.733
Don't want to think about her.
Not here.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.870
You think a lot,
don't you?

24:05.095 --> 24:07.097
Not about much
that matters, Doc.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.099
You think
about your daughter.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.927
You know what I mean.Your son, your team.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.539
You know what I mean.They matter.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.846
[exhales]What was the last thing

24:16.890 --> 24:18.979
you thought about
that upset you?Coming here today.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.766
What else, Jason?

24:28.162 --> 24:30.773
Got a lot of...

24:30.817 --> 24:34.864
I got a whole lot of upset
going on in my head.

24:34.908 --> 24:38.694
Which is why you keep
your "three-foot world."

24:38.738 --> 24:40.740
Which is why you're
most at ease outside the wire

24:40.783 --> 24:42.742
with your team.

24:42.785 --> 24:46.789
You're the calm
in the, uh, chaos.

24:50.967 --> 24:53.100
I suppose that's true.

24:53.143 --> 24:57.539
Adrenaline suppresses memory
and keeps the demons away.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.149
They actually have studies
that have shown

24:59.193 --> 25:01.804
that the act of courtship can
fire up the same adrenal glands

25:01.848 --> 25:03.153
as-as skydiving.[groans]

25:03.197 --> 25:05.155
Courtship?
Courtship, courtship.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.375
What are you talking about here?I think you know
what I'm talking about.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.682
I don't know what
you're talking about.Getting to know someone, Jason.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.598
Unlocking little mysteries,
finding commonality.

25:12.641 --> 25:16.427
Feeling that connection.
That-that is a rush.[exhales sharply]

25:16.471 --> 25:18.995
And then you throw in
sexual attraction...Yeah.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.736
I'm sorry, is this--
What is this?

25:20.780 --> 25:22.346
Is this leading up to you
asking me

25:22.390 --> 25:23.913
if I was breastfed as a child?

25:23.957 --> 25:25.611
Well, there you are
deflecting again.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.917
There you are circling
the question again. Just ask.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.485
Were you anxious
and uncomfortable with Natalie,

25:30.529 --> 25:31.834
or were you calm in the chaos?

25:35.098 --> 25:37.927
Hmm. That's a good
question, Doc.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.712
I hadn't thought of that.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.365
[chuckles]

25:41.409 --> 25:43.759
LIZER:
I'll assess the level
of infection.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.370
Outreach will urge residents
to get vaccines and treatment.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.982
RAY:
Copy that. Sonny, take Vic,

25:49.025 --> 25:50.331
Metal,
guide the outreach workers

25:50.374 --> 25:51.985
and Dr. Lizer here
through the village.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.290
SONNY:
Vic, really?

25:53.334 --> 25:55.510
I don't have time
to babysit this fool.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.644
Clay, Trent, I want you to
take overwatch on these tents.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.689
Brock and I will set security
around the village perimeter.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.561
Let's move out.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.869
SONNY:
Place is creepy quiet
around here.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.002
VIC:
Yeah, it's a ghost town.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.482
Who's the village
Warhol?

26:11.526 --> 26:15.051
Could be anyone.
These outbreaks breed paranoia.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.883
Let me go in alone.

26:20.927 --> 26:23.756
No reason for
everyone to risk it.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.409
You cannot go in alone.

26:25.453 --> 26:28.499
This big fella right here
is gonna go with you. Metal!

26:28.543 --> 26:31.241
Would you mind
escorting the lady?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.855
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.866
I can hear your eyeballs.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.042
Huh?You're wide-eyed, man.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.870
You gotta stop it,
it's creepy enough without it.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.654
Just observing.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.264
Observing?

26:54.308 --> 26:56.963
You know, how
the team works.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.529
Different ways of doing things.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.314
Personalities,
that kind of thing.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.838
[chuckles]
Listen.

27:02.882 --> 27:05.014
Many people have tried
to understand

27:05.058 --> 27:06.625
the great mind of Sonny Quinn,

27:06.668 --> 27:09.845
and they have failed
every single time.

27:09.889 --> 27:12.239
Copy that.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.766
What in the hell are you
observing anyway, man?

27:17.810 --> 27:19.289
About you?

27:19.333 --> 27:21.640
No, about that dead chicken
over there.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.686
All right.

27:24.730 --> 27:27.863
You don't like change.

27:27.907 --> 27:30.692
You know, Jason sidelined,

27:30.736 --> 27:32.781
Ray going for warrant.

27:32.825 --> 27:35.175
Clay frustrated
with his spot,

27:35.218 --> 27:37.307
and spending more time with
his girl than with you.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.353
And I think you're taking that
harder than anyone else.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.007
[Sonny cackles]

27:41.050 --> 27:43.009
Good one, man.

27:43.052 --> 27:44.140
Clay don't have no girl,

27:44.184 --> 27:47.143
but, uh, nice try there,
Mindhunter.

27:47.187 --> 27:48.362
My guy comes in smelling

27:48.405 --> 27:50.973
like lavender body lotion
half the time.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.801
But hey, maybe I'm wrong.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.542
You are wrong.

27:54.585 --> 27:57.197
About everything.
'Cause that's what new guys are.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.199
It stays like that until
I tell you different.

27:59.242 --> 28:01.027
You understand?

28:01.070 --> 28:03.116
Roger that.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.206
Here we go. Pickup truck

28:06.249 --> 28:09.644
1,000 meters north
heading our way.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.906
Armed, old gas masks,

28:10.950 --> 28:13.126
like the video.

28:13.169 --> 28:16.346
That's gonna be Morlu
and his men.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.269
RAY:
All stations, this is Bravo 1.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.707
We have what appears to be
five enemy, armed,

28:28.750 --> 28:30.796
approaching south along MSR.

28:30.839 --> 28:31.971
Bravo 2 and 4,
hold what you've got,

28:32.014 --> 28:34.234
everyone else consolidate on me.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.715
Bravo 1, this is 2.
Copy hold fast.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.544
Let's see if we can
get 'em to stop.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.462
Get inside.

We see one enemy combatant
on foot.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.761
He is heading west

I got nothing. Who's got him?

Havoc, this is 2, do we have
a known point on the squirter?

29:31.595 --> 29:34.816
Yeah, approximately 200 meters
east of the aid tents.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.383
He's moving right towards them.

Yeah, copy, Havoc.

30:39.098 --> 30:40.882
Is everything okay?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.710
What do you mean?

30:42.753 --> 30:44.843
Are you happy?

30:46.714 --> 30:48.194
Why?

30:48.237 --> 30:50.283
You've been reaching out a lot,
last few months.

30:51.588 --> 30:53.460
It's nice,

30:53.503 --> 30:56.855
but I can't help wonder
if something's going on.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.682
Like what?

30:58.726 --> 31:01.033
Just feels like you're looking
for someone to lean on.

31:01.076 --> 31:02.425
A family,

31:02.469 --> 31:05.080
and we can be that for you...

31:05.124 --> 31:07.039
I'm not looking
for anything, okay?

31:07.082 --> 31:08.736
I'm fine.

31:08.779 --> 31:11.217
Sorry. I didn't mean to upset...No, I said

31:11.260 --> 31:12.914
I'm fine.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.917
It's been a long ride
up here

31:15.961 --> 31:17.397
and I'm tired.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.964
And, um, you got
to get back home, right?

31:19.007 --> 31:20.269
Got to take care of everybody?

31:21.575 --> 31:23.577
Okay.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.627
I'll call you tomorrow.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.195
ERIC:
All right,
listen up.

31:33.239 --> 31:35.328
There's been a change of plans.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.330
It seems that our
reason for being here

31:37.373 --> 31:40.202
is a little more complex
than initially presented.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.725
[quietly]:
Here we go.

31:41.769 --> 31:42.901
ERIC:
Four days ago,

31:42.944 --> 31:46.861
when Dioh Morlu hit
one of the aid trucks,

31:46.905 --> 31:49.429
he made off with more
than the usual haul.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.344
The truck was transporting
an Aid Corps

31:51.387 --> 31:52.998
epidemiologist's sample.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.825
Six vials of pathogen.

31:54.869 --> 31:59.395
Basically, Ebola in its most
potent, concentrated form.

31:59.439 --> 32:00.788
MANDY:
If Morlu realizes
what he's got,

32:00.831 --> 32:02.181
he'll put it to market.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.531
A weapons-grade Ebola.ERIC:
Our mission is now

32:04.574 --> 32:06.576
to retrieve the samples.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.187
This happened four days ago?

32:08.230 --> 32:09.840
Why are we just
hearing about it now?

32:11.233 --> 32:14.758
Because intel just confirmed
a location on Morlu,

32:14.802 --> 32:16.717
and we needed you
for PSD anyway.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.111
ERIC:
He's camped out

32:19.154 --> 32:20.721
in a house five miles

32:20.764 --> 32:22.723
outside Kuaiya.

32:22.766 --> 32:25.334
Estimated half dozen
fighters with him.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.206
A cooler filled
with liquid apocalypse.

32:27.249 --> 32:29.904
Sounds like a hell
of a party to crash to me.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.741
So, we'll roll in from here,
uh, blacked out, on NODs.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.656
Target structure's
a single story house.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.137
ISR platform's currently being
deployed over the location.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.443
We'll keep an eye on
any movements in or out.

32:47.487 --> 32:50.272
And Dr. Lizer will accompany you
to make sure the retrieved vials

32:50.316 --> 32:52.274
are safe for transport.

32:52.318 --> 32:55.016
Them walls cave in, Morlu hits
the self-destruct button

32:55.060 --> 32:57.062
and pops them bottles
all over us.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.977
That's why our hit
has to be fast.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.022
The longer time we're on target,
the more chance

33:01.066 --> 33:04.025
we got of the agent being
released or a suit malfunction.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.767
Heading out as soon
as it gets dark. Any questions?

33:06.810 --> 33:09.378
I'd say we've been in the dark
since we got here.

33:09.422 --> 33:12.164
The intel wasn't actionable
until we had Morlu's location.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.688
There was no reason
to read you in.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.385
Took y'all four days
to track him down?

33:16.429 --> 33:17.952
You know, maybe it would
happen a little faster

33:17.996 --> 33:20.128
if you just would've engaged
the eight minds that are here.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.000
The intel wasn't actionable.

33:22.043 --> 33:25.394
There was no reason to read
you in. That's how this works.

33:25.438 --> 33:27.744
I mean, clearly something hasn't
been working for the last

33:27.788 --> 33:30.269
96 hours, because we've
basically been lied to.

33:30.312 --> 33:31.487
SO1, that's enough.

33:31.531 --> 33:32.836
Let's get this done
and get home.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.751
Let's go.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.797
Let's move, buddy.

33:39.104 --> 33:42.672
Get your head in the game
before I knock it off of you.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.718
Yes, sir.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.247
Veering out of your
lane like that,

33:52.291 --> 33:54.815
it's liable to
get you run over.

33:54.858 --> 33:57.078
I'm just trying to understand.What's to understand?

33:57.122 --> 33:59.385
War, fight, bad guy, shoot.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.213
You know, we should have
been read in, man.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.867
It's just, it's bad judgment
from up top.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.913
Your job is not up top,
though, it's down here

34:05.956 --> 34:07.828
on the ground where
the action is.

34:07.871 --> 34:08.916
Yeah, it's also where
warfighters pay

34:08.959 --> 34:10.831

34:10.874 --> 34:12.050

be more than you are,

in the ass one day.

I'll see you again on Friday.

yeah, now that I'm, um,

34:42.341 --> 34:43.559

stopping sessions.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.126
We've only just
cracked the surface.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.259
All right, look, when I walked
in here, I wasn't fine.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.957
Now I'm better than fine.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.002
I'm good. Take the win, Doc.

but victory.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.929
Jason, do you, uh...Yeah?

35:05.973 --> 35:07.540
...do you remember how you felt

35:07.583 --> 35:09.063
that first day
when you came to see me?

35:09.107 --> 35:10.543
You were, you were in crisis.

35:10.586 --> 35:12.414
You know, we've been
over that, so...

35:12.458 --> 35:15.069
The moment that you realized
that the surgery was successful,

35:15.113 --> 35:16.853
that's when you thought

35:16.897 --> 35:18.899
everything was returning
back to normal.

35:18.942 --> 35:22.816
So? So?So Bravo 1, right,
had been resurrected.

35:22.859 --> 35:26.907
The bulletproof problem-solver
had lived to fight another day.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.691
And sure, he might have had
to wait a while

35:28.735 --> 35:30.780
before getting back
in the field, but that was okay,

35:30.824 --> 35:32.695
because there was some
cleanup work to do at home.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.001
Right? Some damage control.

35:34.044 --> 35:35.611

who had seen him hurt

35:35.655 --> 35:37.004

He was stronger than ever.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.487
I have no idea where
you're going with all this,

35:41.530 --> 35:44.098

shoot straight, huh?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.100
The man who walked in here
three weeks ago, Jason,

35:46.144 --> 35:48.015
that man was in pain,
that man was vulnerable.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.582
That was Jason Hayes.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.671
[clears throat]That was a man thrown

35:51.714 --> 35:53.673
by having to face
what was beyond

35:53.716 --> 35:56.893

overwhelmed by what was ahead

35:56.937 --> 35:58.286
and behind in life.

35:58.330 --> 36:02.029
But since then, I have
only been talking to Bravo 1.

36:02.072 --> 36:04.292
That's the man that Jason Hayes
is truly at war with.

36:04.336 --> 36:07.077
That's the man who doesn't look
in the rearview mirror

36:07.121 --> 36:08.992
and refuses to think
beyond his nose,

36:09.036 --> 36:13.258
who lies and withholds to me
and lies to you, Jason.

other than Jason Hayes.

36:16.304 --> 36:20.308
You seem to have this...
all figured out.

36:20.352 --> 36:23.181
Well, what do you
know about me?I know that you can't even see

36:23.224 --> 36:24.138
that you have feelings
for Natalie

there are more complicated

36:36.106 --> 36:39.849
Not enough.
That's my point.

You asked me-- do you remember--
to use my experience

36:42.896 --> 36:45.638

you what was wrong with you?

41:52.248 --> 41:53.815
I know.

41:56.035 --> 41:59.299
I just want to tell you
that I was cleared hot.

41:59.342 --> 42:00.518
[laughs]:
Jason, that's great.

42:00.561 --> 42:02.998
Yeah.
[sighs]

42:03.042 --> 42:05.348
And I-I feel like a part of me
needs to thank you,

42:05.392 --> 42:07.699
because you saved my life.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.439
Well, that's what I do.

42:09.483 --> 42:11.137
I told you, I'm
good at my job.

42:11.180 --> 42:12.442
[sniffles]

42:14.749 --> 42:16.272
What's wrong?

42:18.579 --> 42:21.539
All right, look, I just want
to get a few things clear here.

42:21.582 --> 42:23.758
You know, I don't like
your vegan cardboard food--

42:23.802 --> 42:26.674
it tastes like dirt-- I don't
like that you're seemingly right

42:26.718 --> 42:30.460
all the time, I don't like
that I need your help

42:30.504 --> 42:32.245
when my operating days
are running on fumes

42:32.288 --> 42:34.377
and I don't like that I have
to do this right now.

42:35.422 --> 42:37.206
Do what?

42:38.251 --> 42:40.383
Tell you that I like you.

42:41.428 --> 42:45.040
Just be honest.
That's all.

42:55.834 --> 42:58.619
Hey, there is a great
six-mile run that way.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.578
Right down that way.All right.

43:00.621 --> 43:03.145
Go ahead. Get on it. See you.All right. Let's go.

43:03.189 --> 43:04.364
I'll see you. Bye-bye.What?

43:04.407 --> 43:06.061
I knew that you...Oh, what?

43:06.105 --> 43:08.498
Oh, no.It's this direction. I forgot.
