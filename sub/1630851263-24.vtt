Great news, Titans!

00:32.858 --> 00:35.252
We just got an invite to Wonder
Woman's 80th anniversary party.

00:37.950 --> 00:41.215
Man, I can't believe
Wonder Woman
is turning 80.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.738
She does look great
for her age.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.696
Indeed.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.698
Well, Titans, seniors are
living a lot healthier
these days.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.787
So where's this party at, yo?

00:50.963 --> 00:54.663
It's being held at the
headquarters of DC Comics.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.756
Yeah! Woo!

01:05.717 --> 01:10.374
Welcome, Titans, to the home
of the world's
greatest superheroes.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.688
Greetings, Titans.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.385
I'm so glad you could
make it for our celebration.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.387
Congratulations, Wonder Woman.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.823
Speak up, Cyborg.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.956
The woman is turning 80,
for goodness sake.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.436
Oh, right. Sorry.

01:28.479 --> 01:31.482
Congratulations, Wonder Woman!

01:31.526 --> 01:33.180
Would you cut it out?

01:33.223 --> 01:36.226
Just because she's 80,
doesn't mean she's old.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.708
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have an important
announcement to make.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.887
Attention, everyone, attention.

01:44.930 --> 01:49.065
As you know, Wonder Woman
is celebrating her
anniversary today.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.459
And in honor of this
momentous occasion,

01:51.502 --> 01:54.897
we will be making a special
80'th anniversary issue

01:54.940 --> 01:57.378
of Wonder Woman.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.122
But that's not all.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.646
We'd also
like to unveil

02:04.689 --> 02:06.474
the Wonder Woman
conference room.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.004
- Oh wow.
- That is so cool!

02:15.047 --> 02:18.616
Now, let's get this
party started.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.187
Excuse me, Detective Chimp.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.711
Do you think we could have
something named after us?

02:26.755 --> 02:29.453
Like the Teen
Titans commissary, yo!

02:29.497 --> 02:32.674
Or the Teen Titans
executive office.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.284
Sorry, I'm afraid not.

02:34.328 --> 02:37.896
We reserve that honor
for special occasions.

02:37.940 --> 02:41.248
Last year was the new Teen
Titans 40th anniversary,
and we didn't get anything.

02:41.291 --> 02:45.643
Well, not every hero
receives a namesake
in this office.

02:45.687 --> 02:48.907
Are you kidding me? All these
heroes have something named
after 'em in this office.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.561
There's the Superman
Writer's Room...

02:50.605 --> 02:52.520
The Batman
art department...

02:52.563 --> 02:54.261
The Aquaman
water cooler.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.611
And the Swamp Thing
office plants.

02:56.654 --> 03:01.485
Listen, I understand
you're upset, but we only
name things after A-list heroes

03:01.529 --> 03:05.881
who create
the amazing comic books
our fans have grown to love.

03:05.924 --> 03:08.275
So what are we? B-list heroes?

03:08.318 --> 03:12.496
No, you're more like
D-list heroes.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.325
There has to be something we
can do to prove we belong
on the A-list.

03:15.369 --> 03:18.285
Like putting us in charge
of Wonder Woman's
anniversary issue.

03:18.328 --> 03:22.767
I'm sorry, but I've already
assigned that issue to our
top creative minds.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.597
Then why don't you unassign it?

03:26.641 --> 03:31.298
No, I must ensure that the
issue becomes a huge success

03:31.341 --> 03:33.648
so we don't get crushed
by the competition.

03:33.691 --> 03:36.128
Now, please enjoy the
rest of the party.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.568
Aw mans, this stinks.

03:40.611 --> 03:44.093
Don't worry, Titans.
We're not going to let anything
stop us from making that comic.

03:44.136 --> 03:47.357
But Detective Chimp said
Batman, Superman, and the Flash
are in charge of that issue.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.316
Leave it to me.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.579
Hey, guys,

03:51.622 --> 03:56.061
just wanted to wish you
good luck on Wonder Woman's
anniversary issue.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.810
Now let's get to work, Titans.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.857
If we're going to make an
amazing comic, we need to
come up with an amazing story.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.380
It also needs a
diabolical plot.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.382
And the new villain.

04:12.426 --> 04:15.037
Uh-huh, uh-huh. We should
probably throw in some
cool vehicles.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.995
And some familiar
faces too, yo.

04:17.039 --> 04:19.302
Great. I'll do the writing
and design.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.044
Starfire and Cyborg, you two
will take care of the coloring.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.047
Raven, you can be the anchor.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.004
Whatever.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.484
What about me?

04:27.528 --> 04:30.226
You are going to draw
the speech balloons.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.185
Well, in that case, my
speech balloons are going
to blow your mind, yo.

04:33.229 --> 04:34.926
Titans, go!

04:34.970 --> 04:36.624
Make a comic book.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.430
Thanks for coming, everybody.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.606
We've got something amazing
to show you.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.045
Has anyone seen
Superman, Batman or Flash?

05:07.089 --> 05:11.311
No. Knowing them, they're
probably somewhere
slacking off.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.358
This is terrible.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.534
The deadline for Wonder Woman's
issue is today.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.276
Relax, man.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.365
We already took care of it.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.411
You created
the issue?

05:24.454 --> 05:26.456
That's right, yo. So we could
prove to you

05:26.500 --> 05:29.503
that we's the kind of A-list
heroes who deserve a namesake.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.026
I'm sure you'll find that
our version

05:31.069 --> 05:34.116
truly represents
80 years of Wonder Woman.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.335
Take it away, Cyborg.

06:13.808 --> 06:17.246
Quickly, Steve, to the
invisible station wagon.

07:07.949 --> 07:10.212
So, what do you think?

07:10.255 --> 07:12.301
Is that A-list material
or what?

07:13.520 --> 07:17.524
No! That's the
worst comic ever.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.048
I can't release this.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.442
And without a suitable
replacement, we're going to get
crushed by the competition.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.499
Whoa, what is that?

07:37.848 --> 07:38.936
That's the competition.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.857
We have to stop it
before it destroys DC.

07:46.901 --> 07:50.208
But we can't fight that thing
without our heroes.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.254
Yes, we can.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.125
We still have their namesakes.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.605
Let's power this building up.

08:08.575 --> 08:09.880
We're all linked up, Robin.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.275
Now, let's go take down
the competition.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.407
DC building. Go!

08:31.162 --> 08:32.207
Batman!

08:43.958 --> 08:44.959
Swamp Thing!

08:50.138 --> 08:51.531
Superman!

09:08.330 --> 09:11.159
Aquaman!

09:29.656 --> 09:32.136
- It's over, Titans.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.748
The competition is
too powerful.

09:34.791 --> 09:37.402
Looks like this is
the end of DC.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.890
for helping
us save DC.

10:29.933 --> 10:34.808
And in honor of your heroics,
I am officially promoting you
all to the A-list.

10:37.506 --> 10:40.074
So does that mean we're finally
getting a conference room?

10:40.117 --> 10:42.903
Oh, no. I got something even
better in mind for you.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.383
Behold!

10:50.954 --> 10:52.956
The Titan's
toilet.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.828
Oh, no way!

10:54.871 --> 10:56.743
Are you serious?

10:56.786 --> 11:02.226
This is the
best thing ever!

11:05.360 --> 11:08.493
Toilet! We're in
the A-list now.
