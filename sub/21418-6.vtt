WEBVTT

00:00.334 --> 00:03.268
ANNOUNCER: Your first place
soloist is... GiaNina.

00:03.270 --> 00:04.636
ABBY LEE:<i> Brady gets second,</i>
<i> and then I thought,</i>

00:04.638 --> 00:06.171
"Hmm..."

00:06.173 --> 00:08.741
That male judge was from Miami.

00:08.743 --> 00:12.444
The male judge gave Brady less
points because he's from Miami?

00:12.446 --> 00:14.346
She had no faith in me.
It's like a slap in the face.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.714
<i> SARAH:</i>
<i> I'm from Pittsburgh.</i>

00:15.716 --> 00:17.116
<i> MICHELLE:</i>
<i> We're hometown girls.</i>

00:17.118 --> 00:18.417
Nothing's been handed to us.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.252
We have worked for everything.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.054
Your kid doesn't have a chance.
She sucks!

00:22.056 --> 00:23.455
<i> STACEY:</i>
<i> She doesn't suck.</i>

00:23.457 --> 00:25.591
-She doesn't suck.
-(crying)

00:25.593 --> 00:27.659
Brady, you are clearly
the best dancer on this team,

00:27.661 --> 00:30.562
<i> but I'm not gonna put</i>
<i> all my eggs in one basket.</i>

00:30.564 --> 00:33.265
Brady is going on a break.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.735
¶<i> Livin' on the dance floor.</i> ¶

00:44.378 --> 00:46.612
When we go in there
for pyramid today,

00:46.614 --> 00:49.782
she's not gonna go rolling up
in here, take your win away,

00:49.784 --> 00:52.051
discredit you,
and then go on with some

00:52.053 --> 00:54.820
stupid-ass story about Brady
and how, like, some guy

00:54.822 --> 00:56.422
from Miami, you know,
scored him lower.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.823
It doesn't sit well with me.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.725
Guess what.
It's my turn to talk.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.627
Well, don't make her mad,
'cause I get in trouble for it.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.362
She's gonna know
how I feel today.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.763
And don't quiet me down.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.398
Girls, moms,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.400
let's go.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.104
You're gonna open the door
and lay my thing out.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.540
Brady's not here anymore.
You know, you girls

01:14.542 --> 01:17.776
are gonna have to start
picking up the slack.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.779
I miss Brady a lot,
and he's such

01:20.781 --> 01:22.781
an amazing friend and

01:22.783 --> 01:24.817
a really good dancer.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.585
<i> And it-it's just really sad,</i>

01:26.587 --> 01:29.121
<i> but now that he's gone,</i>

01:29.123 --> 01:32.424
<i> I think that Miss Abby's</i>
<i> gonna give us more attention.</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:34.259
ABBY LEE:
All right.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.228
Well, you all got your wish--
Brady's gone.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.464
I don't think it was our wish.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.166
You sent him home, not us.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.669
ABBY LEE:
Brady has been a decoy.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.305
He draws the focus
somewhere else,

01:46.307 --> 01:49.274
but Brady's gone,

01:49.276 --> 01:52.177
so don't rely on him
to mask the mistakes.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.179
<i> This week, I'm not</i>
<i> going to be easy</i>

01:54.181 --> 01:56.281
on any of these kids.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.584
I need to fix their mistakes

01:58.586 --> 02:01.453
and turn them into
national-winning champions,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.589
or sending Brady home
was all for nothing.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.125
<i> The moms all thought</i>
<i> I gave Brady</i>

02:06.127 --> 02:07.826
too much attention.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.428
Be careful what you wish for.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.698
Moving on to the pyramid.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.802
At the bottom...

02:19.640 --> 02:21.173
Lilli.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.308
Last week,

02:23.310 --> 02:25.544
<i> you were actually facing</i>
<i> the wrong direction</i>

02:25.546 --> 02:27.646
<i> in part of the group routine.</i>

02:27.648 --> 02:30.149
<i> You've messed up in a dance</i>
<i> almost every single week.</i>

02:30.151 --> 02:31.617
I expect more from you.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.352
Shame on you.

02:39.426 --> 02:42.161
Okay. Next...

02:48.402 --> 02:49.735
...we have Hannah.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.938
Hannah, it's aggravating that I

02:52.940 --> 02:57.276
hand-chose you from kids
from all over the country,

02:57.278 --> 02:58.911
and you're getting seventh.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.713
<i> Seventh place has no place</i>
<i> on this team.</i>

03:01.715 --> 03:03.615
Do you have anything to say
for yourself?

03:05.286 --> 03:06.752
Mmm...

03:08.923 --> 03:11.290
ANN:
I thought she did
a fantastic job.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.758
She went out there,
she gave it her all.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.892
ABBY LEE:
Okay, Ann,

03:13.894 --> 03:16.461
if that was her all,

03:16.463 --> 03:18.630
her all is not good enough.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.466
She didn't exceed
your expectations?

03:21.468 --> 03:24.503
She exceeded my expectations
for the Hannah that I know.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.904
Is that the Hannah that's gonna

03:25.906 --> 03:29.208
make it in this business?
Hell no.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.777
-As an educator, you should...
-Wait a minute!

03:34.515 --> 03:36.615
The hick from Indiana

03:36.617 --> 03:39.751
is gonna tell me,
who I have taught

03:39.753 --> 03:41.753
all over the world,

03:41.755 --> 03:43.889
what an educator is?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.490
I'm not talking
about dance steps.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.360
I'm talking about morals
and leading children.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.929
She couldn't beat G-GiaNina's
with her piece, Abby.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.900
It was not as difficult.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.668
Because she can't do anything
more difficult!

03:56.670 --> 03:59.304
ANN:
She can. Give her...
Let her try.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.773
Show me. Show me. Show me.
Right now, show me.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.676
-Do ten pirouettes. Show me.
-JOANNE: Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

04:04.678 --> 04:05.978
-She-she cannot...
-ABBY LEE: Do a jeté.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.713
Show me now!

04:07.715 --> 04:10.349
She can't do ten pirouettes.
You know that.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.316
Then shut your mouth.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.621
Whatever.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.955
ABBY LEE:
Next we have...

04:19.793 --> 04:21.627
Sarah.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.929
Sarah, I see potential in you.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.965
<i> I just need</i>
<i> to figure out if you</i>

04:26.967 --> 04:29.768
can shine outside

04:29.770 --> 04:33.305
of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.707
Next...

04:37.478 --> 04:38.777
...we have Savannah.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.947
Savannah, in the competition,

04:41.949 --> 04:44.750
<i> you pulled my eye,</i>
<i> you pulled focus...</i>

04:46.287 --> 04:47.753
...but in a good way.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.323
Second row.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.028
We have Pressley.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.430
Pressley, you were clean,

04:58.432 --> 05:01.433
<i> you were beautiful,</i>
<i> you did a nice job.</i>

05:03.337 --> 05:05.604
On top of the pyramid
is GiaNina.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.705
Yay!

05:09.543 --> 05:12.010
ABBY LEE:
I am not going to take
anything away from that.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.912
-That was a win.
-Oh, today... Today.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.014
-It was a victory for you.
-Today, you're gonna say that.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.949
But on Saturday,
you want to take it away...

05:17.951 --> 05:20.986
The last thing I need
is a delusional mother

05:20.988 --> 05:23.722
and delusional team members

05:23.724 --> 05:27.392
thinking that they should've

05:27.394 --> 05:29.328
-beaten Brady.
-JOANNE: Excuse me.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.631
The judges thought
she should win, and so she did.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.800
And instead of
celebrating my kid,

05:34.802 --> 05:37.469
you came in and tried
to discredit her and gave Brady

05:37.471 --> 05:40.639
some bogus-ass story that the
reason why he lost is 'cause

05:40.641 --> 05:42.974
some judge was from Miami.
Really? Really?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.609
Absolutely, really.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.712
There was definitely
a conflict of interest.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.347
If you don't have it
in black and white,

05:48.349 --> 05:49.581
you shouldn't
be saying anything.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.350
So when I go out...
Shut up, Joanne!

05:51.352 --> 05:53.051
Absolutely not. No.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.822
You're saying all this stuff,
but you have no facts.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.024
Here's the results.
Oh, let's look.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.892
You got the scores?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.828
<i> ASHLEY:</i>
<i>Joanne's, like, trying to prove</i>

06:02.830 --> 06:04.396
that she knows more than Abby.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.431
<i> Abby is not gonna like that.</i>

06:06.433 --> 06:08.867
Nope. Not in her house.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.604
Look at this. Brady was scored
higher by the male judge.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.972
-No, he wasn't.
-Yes, he was.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.741
-No, he wasn't.
-You can look right here.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.509
You know what, if you're gonna
dis-dis-disrespect

06:17.511 --> 06:20.379
my kid and take it all away,
get the facts first.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.947
Sweetheart, take this home
and frame it,

06:21.949 --> 06:24.015
-'cause it will
never happen again.
-Oh, yeah?

06:24.017 --> 06:26.885
-I will, and I will bring it
back to you when it does.
-No, it won't.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.754
-Yes, I will.
-It's not gonna happen.
You're not gonna beat Brady.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.690
GiaNina, you did a nice job.
Move on.

06:33.427 --> 06:34.793
<i> Sure, be happy</i>

06:34.795 --> 06:37.129
for your child,
be thrilled that she won,

06:37.131 --> 06:39.865
<i> but I think that</i>
<i> this woman thinks,</i>

06:39.867 --> 06:44.035
<i>because she beat Brady, the sun</i>
<i> rises and sets on her child.</i>

06:44.037 --> 06:46.738
<i> And that's</i>
<i> a bad attitude to have,</i>

06:46.740 --> 06:48.507
because when you think
that you're all that

06:48.509 --> 06:50.041
and a bag of chips,
that's when somebody

06:50.043 --> 06:51.543
is gonna knock you down.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.978
All right, this weekend,
we're traveling

06:52.980 --> 06:56.515
to Sewell, New Jersey to attend
Fierce Dance Challenge.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.116
The solos go to...

07:02.156 --> 07:04.656
...Sarah and...

07:08.095 --> 07:09.528
GiaNina.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.664
Sarah, you are portraying

07:12.666 --> 07:15.033
an Olympic gold medalist,

07:15.035 --> 07:17.002
Mary Lou Retton.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.607
This is an acrobatic
gymnastic routine.

07:22.609 --> 07:26.178
This is your moment to shine,
just like Mary Lou did.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.747
<i> SARAH: This is my first solo</i>
<i> at the ALDC,</i>

07:28.749 --> 07:30.549
and I'm really happy
that it's acro,

07:30.551 --> 07:31.883
because that's my strong suit,

07:31.885 --> 07:33.885
<i> even though I'm</i>
<i> a little nervous</i>

07:33.886 --> 07:35.886
<i> to go against GiaNina</i>
<i> because she beat Brady.</i>

07:35.889 --> 07:38.824
GiaNina, your solo character is

07:38.826 --> 07:40.759
Snooki.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.861
(moms gasp)

07:42.863 --> 07:44.463
ASHLEY:
Yes, Jersey.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.498
Really? She's like,
"Who is that?"

07:46.500 --> 07:47.632
-(laughter)
-ABBY LEE: And I am sure,

07:47.634 --> 07:49.568
"sure,"

07:49.570 --> 07:51.603
that your mother

07:51.605 --> 07:54.005
can help you with this routine.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.141
<i> STACEY:</i>
<i> When you hear a Snooki dance,</i>

07:56.143 --> 07:57.943
<i> that sounds ridiculous,</i>

07:57.945 --> 08:00.512
but everyone knows-- now,
now they know-- that when they

08:00.514 --> 08:01.613
<i> speak up to Abby,</i>
<i> look what happens.</i>

08:01.615 --> 08:03.548
<i> You get a Snooki solo.</i>

08:03.550 --> 08:05.116
ABBY LEE:
The group dance this week

08:05.118 --> 08:08.887
is called "The Widows."

08:08.889 --> 08:10.789
(scoffs)

08:10.791 --> 08:13.091
You will all portray
the character

08:13.093 --> 08:16.061
of a wife mourning

08:16.063 --> 08:17.963
the loss

08:17.965 --> 08:19.764
of her husband.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.000
After he's six feet under,

08:22.002 --> 08:25.203
you are celebrating the joy

08:25.205 --> 08:28.840
-that he is gone.
-(laughter)

08:28.842 --> 08:31.109
All right, moms,
you're dismissed. Go.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.677
Girls, spread apart,
stretch out.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.818
MICHELLE:
Oh, my gosh, pyramid.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.755
<i> STACEY:</i>
<i> Yeah, that's what happens</i>
<i> when we stick up</i>

08:43.757 --> 08:44.923
-for our kids.
-Right.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.558
Well, you know,
it is what it is.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.896
Crickets.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.731
(imitates buzzer)

08:52.733 --> 08:55.767
<i> ABBY LEE:</i>
<i> All right, our prop is here.</i>

08:55.769 --> 08:57.702
<i> ANN:</i>
<i> (gasps) Oh, my gosh,</i>
<i> there's a coffin.</i>

08:57.704 --> 08:59.337
It's a little morbid.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.971
<i> Never seen a coffin</i>
<i> on stage. Never.</i>

09:00.974 --> 09:03.275
I have problems, like,
doing tricks over it,

09:03.277 --> 09:05.544
on it, flipping-- I don't know.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.245
<i>I don't know, maybe I just have</i>
<i>a different vibe because, like,</i>

09:07.247 --> 09:08.813
<i> I had to pick out</i>
<i> my mother's coffin.</i>

09:08.815 --> 09:11.683
So, like, I-I don't find humor
in any of it.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.654
<i> ABBY LEE:</i>
<i> All right, girls, listen up.</i>

09:15.656 --> 09:16.922
Has anyone ever been
to a funeral?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.124
Okay. Well, it-it-it's a room,

09:19.126 --> 09:21.560
it smells weird,

09:21.562 --> 09:24.262
there's beautiful arrangements
of flowers all around.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.232
If the person was well liked.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.902
And then imagine that
your husband, your spouse,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.171
is laying inside
that casket dead.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.675
And you're putting this big act
on for all of his relatives.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.109
You didn't really like
your husband,

09:38.111 --> 09:40.145
maybe he didn't really like you,

09:40.147 --> 09:41.780
maybe it wasn't
a great marriage.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.322
And step, go. Right.

<i> I feel like this week's</i>

10:09.910 --> 10:12.310
gonna be terrible,

<i> Honestly, I don't think it had</i>

10:17.784 --> 10:19.584
anything to do with our kids.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.385
I think it had to do with
the fact that Abby couldn't

10:21.388 --> 10:23.288
<i> help herself,</i>
<i> she couldn't give our girls</i>

10:23.290 --> 10:24.956
the attention they needed
with him here.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.826
I mean, I'm excited

10:27.828 --> 10:29.094
<i> that the girls have Abby's</i>
<i> attention 100%.</i>

10:29.096 --> 10:30.095
<i> -STACEY: Me, too.</i>
<i> -ERIN: Right.</i>

10:30.097 --> 10:31.396
<i> And now...</i>

10:31.398 --> 10:33.365
maybe they'll step up

10:33.367 --> 10:35.033
and they'll start
proving themselves,

10:35.035 --> 10:36.901
and you're gonna see more
from all of them.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.169
I mean, the best example
I can have

10:38.171 --> 10:39.404
<i> is that Brady was not the lead</i>

10:39.406 --> 10:41.072
<i> every single time.</i>

10:41.074 --> 10:42.874
<i> Lilli had one chance</i>
<i> to be the lead,</i>

10:42.876 --> 10:44.242
and she did it, and they won,

10:44.244 --> 10:46.711
so to me that means
they can do it.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.080
But we know what she's gonna say
if they don't win.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.049
<i> -Oh, she's gonna blame it</i>
<i> 'cause Brady's not here.</i>
<i> -Exactly.</i>

10:51.051 --> 10:53.385
Lilli, turn your right heel out.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.153
Because if the kid...
these kids don't win, this is...

10:55.155 --> 10:56.788
We are in trouble
if we do not win.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.390
-Oh, we're dead.

Sarah, what are you
doing over there?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.300
Hit it on "fun."

11:09.302 --> 11:11.836
And the rest of you
don't even know the counts.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.905
If I was judging right now,

11:13.907 --> 11:16.875
I would put you in this coffin
with my remarks.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.977
You're not tight enough,
you're not sharp enough

11:18.979 --> 11:20.712
on the movements.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.981
You don't have Brady
to camouflage you.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.750
We can't send Brady over there

11:25.752 --> 11:28.853
doing an aerial walkover
so that nobody looks over here

11:28.855 --> 11:30.922

we have going on.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.234

12:58.912 --> 13:01.279
I'm not from that part
of New Jersey.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.215

the dancing part, though.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.886

-This is, like, talent show.

Yes, thank you.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.570
She made that just difficult.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.071
See, Brady doesn't do that.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.340
He just does it,

13:31.011 --> 13:33.077

13:33.079 --> 13:34.979
I want the kids to portray
a character,

13:34.981 --> 13:37.015

she's giving GiaNina
another solo out of spite.

why? What kind... What-what...

13:52.532 --> 13:54.499

<i> -STACEY: She didn't think</i>

13:56.436 --> 13:58.036
I need a surefire win
at this competition.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.904
If you can beat Brady,
you beat anybody.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.940
You don't need the "it" dance.

14:01.942 --> 14:05.143

This is Sarah, who's from

14:25.532 --> 14:28.533
Do you get it? This dance

14:28.535 --> 14:31.269
This needs to be
what people remember you for,

is that roundoff back handspring
layout step-out

14:33.306 --> 14:35.907

-I can't take her

-What's up with that hat?

14:43.950 --> 14:45.183

14:46.286 --> 14:48.586
Yes. One and a two.

All your friends and your family

15:24.691 --> 15:27.025

15:27.027 --> 15:29.160
I was wondering, your husband
hasn't come to, like,

15:29.162 --> 15:30.962
any of the competitions
we've done.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.231

It's complicated.

-No. I mean, it's just
been normal.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.182
-He never goes?
-Uh-uh.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.351
But I just think, like,
if it's Sarah's dream

15:53.353 --> 15:55.453
<i> and he supports Sarah, like,</i>
<i> wouldn't he want to come</i>

15:55.455 --> 15:57.221
-and see her?
-Well, he sees her on Sunday.

-He sees her, like, every day.
-But, like, see her, like,

15:59.492 --> 16:02.160
-I guess...
-Dance.
-MICHELLE: Dance...

16:02.162 --> 16:05.663
It drives this wedge.
We live, like, two separate,

16:05.665 --> 16:08.032
almost completely
different lives.

16:08.034 --> 16:09.500
Because I choose
to follow this with her.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.003
It causes conflict.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.440
<i> It's a real challenge to be</i>

16:15.442 --> 16:18.443
a dance mom when you add up
cost of dance,

<i> time and travel,</i>
<i> and away from your family.</i>

16:21.348 --> 16:23.648

But if you're acting,
and you're over the top

17:25.678 --> 17:27.645

17:27.647 --> 17:28.746
that you're celebrating
his death.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.448
Let me see actresses.

Let me see you
dance out there and wail.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.684

Together! Together!

18:31.311 --> 18:32.543
They touch.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.480
<i> All right, listen.</i>

18:35.482 --> 18:37.582
You have an ultimatum.
If you make a mistake

18:37.584 --> 18:39.784
in the group,
this dance, this week,

18:39.786 --> 18:41.619
you're benched next week.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.590
If you make a mistake
in the group dance on stage,

18:45.592 --> 18:47.158
you will not be dancing
in the group next week.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.493
Seriously, that's (bleep).

Can't you find
the humor out of it?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.101
Don't you think
people think it's funny?

19:13.102 --> 19:14.619
-People love Snooki.
She's real popular.
-Right?

19:14.621 --> 19:15.853
JOANNE:
I don't think it's too funny.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.722
My kid's Italian.
We're not gonna go out there

19:17.724 --> 19:19.590
-and make fun of Snooki
in New Jers...
-ANN: So it's not because

19:19.592 --> 19:21.492

<i> -JOANNE: No. Ann, please.</i>
<i> -Oh, come on.</i>

19:23.363 --> 19:24.795
I think it's a crazy dance,
but at the same time,

19:24.797 --> 19:26.731
I think that Joanne's mad

19:26.733 --> 19:28.299
because Sarah can beat GiaNina,
because...

19:30.570 --> 19:33.738
Listen, Gia's not a joke.

19:33.740 --> 19:34.939
We don't go
to dance competitions

Your mother's here.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.935
She's in the room
on private lesson time.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.804
JOANNE:
I want to strip "Snooki"
off Gia and let Gia be Gia.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.272
I-I don't want her
to represent Snooki.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.974
That's<i> Jersey Shore</i> crap.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.243
She can go out there
and do this exact dance

20:12.245 --> 20:14.312
and rock that
without a name attached to it.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.847
She's portraying a character,
and she's here because

20:16.849 --> 20:19.350
-she wants to be an actress.
-But you named it "Snooki."
But you named it "Snooki."

20:19.352 --> 20:21.319
Her name is GiaNina.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.721
She's an Italian-American.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.490
-But why are you
ashamed of that?
-I do not want her representing

20:26.492 --> 20:29.794
Snooki in New Jersey
in front of everyone I know.

20:34.334 --> 20:38.369

make me Snooki, that's fine.

-Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

-Who is she?

So... so, what happened
down there, Jo?

JOANNE: If she doesn't, like,
strip down the "Snooki,"

or how to do it.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.497

I don't care if her family
is in the mob.

<i> and she has lots of potential.</i>

21:38.431 --> 21:40.464
I don't think
it's been explored yet,

21:40.466 --> 21:42.933
and I think
she has a lot to learn,

21:42.935 --> 21:46.337
<i> but if she can nail</i>
<i> those tricks time after time,</i>

21:46.339 --> 21:49.440

cruel insults to me...

Wake up, Michelle.

Wake up.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.764
...and questioning
what we're doing,

22:13.766 --> 22:15.433
and then here I am, week six,

22:15.435 --> 22:17.735
and I have, like,
this little ounce of...

22:17.737 --> 22:21.372
"Well, maybe she really does
believe in my kid."

22:21.374 --> 22:23.407
It gives you a little bit
of that hope, like,

hey, we're chasing this dream,
we're following it.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.644

23:27.640 --> 23:29.173
Make sure
that the leg is straight.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.409
Turn out the bottom foot,
make sure the penché

23:31.411 --> 23:33.411
is the same
as when you turn attitudes,

23:33.413 --> 23:34.912
so then it stays there.
Bend your leg,

23:34.914 --> 23:36.747
arch your head up

26:13.272 --> 26:15.239
Okay? I don't want you

If you want to do the number
in slippers, Gia, you go ahead.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.654
It's not your decision to make.
It's my decision,

No, it's not over slippers,

It's over, it's done.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.949
I don't want to hear her mouth
anymore today.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.651
-Fine, I think
it's ridiculous that...
-You rest on your laurels

27:00.653 --> 27:02.353
from last week, and that's good.

27:02.355 --> 27:05.155
<i> GIANINA:</i>
<i> My mom doesn't know</i>

27:05.157 --> 27:07.157
Now I can't dance.

<i> Abby's never gonna give me</i>

27:09.328 --> 27:11.328

ABBY LEE:
All right, so,
out there on stage,

27:15.935 --> 27:17.334
you have to hit the tricks,
all right?

27:17.336 --> 27:20.337
So you have to nail them,
and the very last

27:20.339 --> 27:23.207
cartwheel stamp tuck
has to be set up high.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.142
Don't go backwards. Go up.
Got it?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.844
All right.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.412
Let's go, girls.

27:28.414 --> 27:29.847
JOANNE:
I backed down.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.815
I don't understand
why we can't still do it.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.384
STACEY:
She said slippers or no dance,

27:33.386 --> 27:35.986
you knew that was gonna happen,
you got no dance.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.688
My fault for sticking up
for my kid?

27:37.690 --> 27:39.289
-Really?
-ANN: You got what you wanted.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.858
She's not doing the dance.
She's not wearing the sl...

27:40.860 --> 27:42.059
She's upset because
she didn't think

27:42.061 --> 27:43.127
that this was gonna happen.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.862
I am not saying that, Ashley.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.131
I am saying
I'm sticking up for my kid,

27:47.133 --> 27:48.832
and if you don't freaking
understand it,

27:48.834 --> 27:50.901
then sit there
and look F'ing pretty.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.137
Okay?

27:53.139 --> 27:55.773
She set the terms.
She set the terms.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.374
You're just happy Gia isn't
against you, 'cause she'd be...

27:57.376 --> 28:00.144
she'd be killing it.
She'd be killing it!

28:00.146 --> 28:01.412

Sarah's gonna kill it.

-You made it.
-LARRY: I did, I did.

Aw. So glad you came.

<i> SARAH: This is my first solo</i>

<i> Abby said that my dance</i>

28:41.153 --> 28:42.720
looks really good this week,

28:42.722 --> 28:44.221

a lot of confidence

28:44.223 --> 28:46.323
to go out and kill it on stage.

28:46.325 --> 28:49.026
<i> But I'm still really nervous</i>

<i> Does she have the stamina</i>
<i> to stay on</i>

29:14.053 --> 29:15.986
on that stage and nail
every one of these tricks?

29:15.988 --> 29:17.821

stick the landings.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.171
Oh...

30:50.182 --> 30:55.118
My dad was there,
and it made me feel really good.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.388
Because I got to see
he really does support me.

31:01.327 --> 31:04.528
It means a lot to me
because I love my dad.

31:06.599 --> 31:08.565
ABBY LEE:
Mary Lou Retton.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.268
I thought you did
a really nice job,

31:11.270 --> 31:13.470
so I give you
an A for effort there.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.474
All right?
Right dead center stage,

31:17.476 --> 31:19.610
so we need to work on that.

31:19.612 --> 31:23.013
GiaNina, I'm convinced that
the audience would've loved you.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.382
Just know it's not my fault.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.417
-It's your mother's fault.
-Well, you know,
we can agree to disagree.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.286
-It is your fault.
-We're not gonna
agree to disagree.

31:29.288 --> 31:30.587
You're gonna learn to keep
your damn mouth shut.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.456
-Simple.
-I wanted her to dance.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.091
I didn't want her to dance
with the slippers on

31:34.093 --> 31:35.559
and be associated
with that character.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.594
I know! You want her to do
what you want to do.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.930
-This is the ALDC.
-No! I do... I do everything
you want to do.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.232
-It's not your competition team.
It's mine.
-I do... I...

31:42.234 --> 31:43.467
-So shut your mouth.
-I respect that.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.202
I am sick of hearing from you.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.571
No, not when it comes to my kid
and her reputation.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.007
Her reputation?
She didn't dance.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.508
You know what?
Give somebody else a solo

31:51.510 --> 31:53.143
that portrays this image.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.344
Oh, I'll give
somebody else a solo.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.413
You don't have
to worry about it.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.181
<i> GIANINA:</i>
<i> I really wanted to dance.</i>

31:58.183 --> 32:00.050
All I want to do is prove to her
that I can do anything.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.919
She was coming at me and you

32:01.921 --> 32:03.921
with that solo
just to make fun of us.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.622
<i> And it's a no-go for me.</i>
<i> I'm your mother.</i>

32:05.624 --> 32:07.491
So, moving on.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.326
ABBY LEE:
All right, I think we need

32:09.328 --> 32:10.560
to get ready
for the group dance.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.670
All right, girls, line up.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.972
All right, this is
where you prove yourself.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.974
Nobody is going
to look at Brady.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.542
He's not there.
Everybody, we looked at him.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.577
So when they're off
and they're a hot mess,

32:27.579 --> 32:29.613
and your kid's
forgetting the dance,

32:29.615 --> 32:31.515
they were looking at him.
There's only six of you

32:31.517 --> 32:32.649
on that huge stage.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.284
Everybody can be seen.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.954
Lilli, I gave you an ultimatum.

32:36.956 --> 32:40.190
You sit out the group dance
next week if you make a mistake.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.425
'Cause it's been too many times.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.126
Nobody else? Just her?

32:43.128 --> 32:44.695
ABBY LEE:
Maybe I see star potential

32:44.697 --> 32:46.563
in her that I don't see
in other people.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.597
Did you ever think of that?

32:47.599 --> 32:49.599
Get the coffin.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.702
-Let's go.
-Literally kill it.

32:51.704 --> 32:53.537
-Okay.
-They'll see your
beautiful faces

32:53.539 --> 32:55.639
-and your beautiful technique,
and you know it.
-Okay.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.708
ANN:
Be careful.

32:57.710 --> 32:59.443
<i> I'm not really sure</i>
<i> how the group dance</i>

32:59.445 --> 33:01.645
<i> is gonna be received.</i>

33:01.647 --> 33:03.680
I mean, people get
an emotional response

33:03.682 --> 33:06.149
when they see
a coffin sometimes.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.118
And this could really kill
our chances of winning

33:08.120 --> 33:09.319

That is not an overall

38:42.888 --> 38:45.955
so I am bringing in
a new team member.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.895
(gasps)

38:51.897 --> 38:52.996
What?

38:56.034 --> 38:59.602
ABBY LEE:
This kid will blend better
with you guys as a group.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.038
She can be beat, right, Lilli?

39:02.040 --> 39:04.808
<i> STACEY: I have about two</i>
<i> whole seconds of happiness</i>

39:04.810 --> 39:06.876
before Abby drops the bomb

39:06.878 --> 39:08.945
that Elliana and Yolanda
are coming back to the team.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.113
Yolanda and I

39:10.115 --> 39:11.915
<i> have an ugly past.</i>

39:11.917 --> 39:14.417
-You called me a bitch,
I called you a freak!
-Hey! Hey!

39:14.419 --> 39:16.086
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-Call the police.
-Seriously?

39:16.088 --> 39:17.854
-Call the police.
-Seriously, you stay
away from me!

39:17.856 --> 39:19.622
-Call the police right now!
-You stay away from me!

39:19.624 --> 39:20.924
I'm not happy.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.025
So, I don't understand.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.526
Why are you gonna
bring somebody in

39:23.528 --> 39:24.828
that's toxic to this group
right now?

39:24.830 --> 39:26.996
Do you think that's beneficial
to the rest of us?

39:26.998 --> 39:28.865
She choked out Stacey.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.600
Well, we'll have to make sure
that doesn't happen, then.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.535
I mean, it happened before.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.471
She's, like, psychotic.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.539
It's not just that
she choked me.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.707
It's that she makes you insane.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.110
Like, she makes you crazy.

39:40.112 --> 39:41.644
<i> LILLIANA:</i>
<i>I don't know if Elliana will be</i>

39:41.646 --> 39:43.012
an asset to this dance team.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.714
She could make it,
or she can break it.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.716
<i> But we're gonna work together,</i>

39:46.718 --> 39:48.418
<i> and we're gonna be friends</i>
<i> no matter what.</i>

39:48.420 --> 39:50.387
Maybe Yolanda isn't
my favorite person ever,

39:50.389 --> 39:52.088
but I still like Elliana.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.823
I-I have a history with Yolanda.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.725
I know that she can be obsessive

39:55.727 --> 39:57.427
and too critical
on other kids.

39:57.429 --> 39:58.895
Savannah and Elliana
have competed

39:58.897 --> 40:01.498
against each other
three or four times now,

40:01.500 --> 40:03.433
and she's never beat Elliana.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.603
She came in first runner-up
at the dance awards,

40:06.605 --> 40:08.872
and Elliana won, so...

40:08.874 --> 40:11.541
Maybe you and Yolanda should go
head-to-head doing solos.

40:11.543 --> 40:14.144
<i> I thought Stacey would be</i>
<i> the one throwing a fit</i>

40:14.146 --> 40:15.412
<i> when I announced that</i>

40:15.414 --> 40:16.746
Elliana was coming back.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.616
But I think I struck
a chord with Erin.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.117
Erin, you should have
kept your mouth shut.

40:21.119 --> 40:24.053
Right here, right now in this
room, we're a team, right?

40:24.055 --> 40:26.623
-Yes.
-Well, you didn't look
like a team out there.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.528
So, what's our defense mechanism
with somebody like this?

40:31.530 --> 40:33.930
I'm gonna keep her close,
'cause you keep crazy close.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.899
Closer than your friends.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.434
STACEY:
I kept crazy close.

40:37.436 --> 40:38.835
Ended with my neck in her hands.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.670
Next week will be interesting.

40:49.448 --> 40:50.947
Where is Savannah?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.582
I don't think she's coming.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.184
Erin doesn't want to lose
to Elliana.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.186
Hi, ladies!

40:56.188 --> 40:57.987
I hate her.

40:57.989 --> 41:01.658
-Where's Elliana gone?
-She can't dance.

41:01.660 --> 41:05.061
<i> ABBY LEE:</i>
<i> The group routine is "Hazing."</i>

41:05.063 --> 41:08.665
<i> It's all fun and games</i>
<i> until somebody dies.</i>

41:08.667 --> 41:09.866
Pack your stuff. Let's go.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.234
<i> Nobody is treating my daughter</i>

41:11.236 --> 41:13.603
like that-- nobody.

41:13.605 --> 41:16.072
You couldn't be a psychologist
anymore because you...

41:16.074 --> 41:18.508
I am still a psychologist,
you stupid bitch.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.510
<i> ABBY LEE:</i>
<i> Welcome to hell week.</i>
