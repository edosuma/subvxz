00:15.142 --> 00:16.210
Guys, check it out.

00:16.229 --> 00:19.612
Somebody just left all these
toys at the police station.

00:20.595 --> 00:22.770
Guess they figured if cops
have something to play with,

00:22.801 --> 00:26.001
Then we won't stress out and
accidentally shoot somebody.

00:27.217 --> 00:30.989
Or, and stay with me here,
inspector meathead,

00:31.544 --> 00:35.064
Maybe these toys
are for the toy drive.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.098
Yeah, Kelso,

00:37.133 --> 00:39.834
These toys are probably all those
needy kids get on Christmas morning.

00:39.857 --> 00:42.397
Holy crap! Is that an
Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle?

00:43.252 --> 00:45.351
Oh, my god!
Let's set it up.

00:46.320 --> 00:50.760
We have to find something for Evel
Knievel to crash into, like something funny.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.640
Fez, lie down over here
and close your eyes.

00:54.460 --> 00:55.010
Oh,

00:55.288 --> 00:57.449
Man, I feel just like
a kid on, like,

00:57.484 --> 01:00.924
I don't know, like some morning where
kids get to open a lot of presents.

01:01.641 --> 01:03.719
I don't feel
right about this.

01:03.895 --> 01:06.554
Oh, buddy, we're not
gonna aim it at your head.

01:07.024 --> 01:08.527
No, I'm not worried
about my head.

01:08.562 --> 01:11.350
Awesome. He's not worried about
his head. Let's aim it at his head.

01:12.243 --> 01:16.669
No, I just don't feel right about
taking these toys away from kids.

01:16.726 --> 01:18.417
Oh, but, Fez,

01:18.886 --> 01:21.446
This could be the Christmas
that I never had.

01:21.481 --> 01:25.083
My parents wouldn't get me cool stuff
when I was a kid. Every year,

01:25.353 --> 01:26.915
I got a raincoat.

01:28.312 --> 01:30.461
And then to make
sure it worked,

01:30.485 --> 01:33.695
We had to go outside and Red
would spray me with a hose.

01:35.198 --> 01:37.969
Yeah, Fez, what about
my Christmas, man?

01:38.016 --> 01:40.630
I mean, I'd wake up in the
morning, rush out in my P.J.S

01:40.665 --> 01:44.141
And find what strange man Santa had
left laying underneath my mother.

01:46.031 --> 01:48.838
Fine. We'll each open
one present, but only one.

01:48.873 --> 01:49.883
All right.

01:55.256 --> 01:57.099
Look at what
we've done.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.175
What should
we do now?

02:02.271 --> 02:03.986
We need batteries.

02:07.590 --> 02:09.446
A buttload.

02:46.816 --> 02:49.882
Thanks for helping me with my
Christmas party, girls.

02:49.932 --> 02:54.451
You know, this is the most important event
of the year for the ladies of Point Place, or

02:54.516 --> 02:57.484
As we like to call
ourselves, the Lopps.

03:02.216 --> 03:05.701
You know, the Lopps are known for
being super stuck-Up and totally 2-Faced.

03:05.736 --> 03:07.509
I can't wait
till I get in.

03:09.071 --> 03:10.268
Hey,
Mrs. Forman,

03:10.515 --> 03:12.898
I need, like,
a buttload of batteries.

03:15.071 --> 03:16.065
What for?

03:16.195 --> 03:17.310
Oh, um,

03:17.662 --> 03:20.210
Kelso wants to see how badly
he can shock himself.

03:23.486 --> 03:24.179
Oh,

03:24.508 --> 03:26.072
Okay, they're
in the drawer.

03:29.595 --> 03:33.106
Oh, hey, Steven, don't forget about the
ladies of Point Place party tonight.

03:33.153 --> 03:34.560
Oh, yeah,
I forgot.

03:34.595 --> 03:36.896
I can't go. Something
more important came up.

03:41.335 --> 03:43.002
But you
promised you'd go.

03:43.225 --> 03:43.826
Jackie,

03:44.132 --> 03:45.447
If I promised,

03:45.494 --> 03:47.208
I clearly
wasn't listening,

03:49.322 --> 03:51.247
Which you should
have known, so

03:51.693 --> 03:52.797
This is
your fault.

03:54.448 --> 03:56.121
I can't believe Steven.

03:56.144 --> 03:58.833
He knows this is a big deal
to me, and he doesn't even care.

03:59.056 --> 04:00.923
Jackie, don't be
so hard on him.

04:00.958 --> 04:03.061
I know it's a big deal
to you, and I don't care.

04:05.053 --> 04:06.110
Knock, knock.

04:07.613 --> 04:11.147
Patty Ryals, I didn't know
you were back in town.

04:11.191 --> 04:13.704
Well, you always return
to where you were young,

04:13.727 --> 04:16.216
Which I know for you,
Kitty, is a long time ago.

04:17.402 --> 04:22.122
Actually, I just dropped by to tell you I'm taking
over tonight's ladies of Point Place Christmas party.

04:22.163 --> 04:24.512
What? No, I'm
in charge.

04:24.559 --> 04:25.791
Past tense.

04:25.862 --> 04:28.428
The Lopps remembered that
you aren't the most reliable

04:28.463 --> 04:33.935
L. Of P.P. After I reminded them
about the punchbowl incident of 1973.

04:38.914 --> 04:42.144
You dredged up
my chappaquiddick?

04:43.943 --> 04:45.719
What did
Mrs. Forman do?

04:45.946 --> 04:48.138
She spiked the
wrong punchbowl.

04:52.937 --> 04:56.420
I missed the sixth grade Christmas play
'cause I couldn't walk a straight line.

04:59.442 --> 05:01.218
Verti-Bird central,

05:01.310 --> 05:03.271
You are cleared
for take off.

05:03.364 --> 05:05.624
Prepare to
transport funyun.

05:09.002 --> 05:12.070
We have visual.
Funyun's remaining secure.

05:12.255 --> 05:15.692
Verti-Bird to Kelso,
prepare to receive funyun.

05:15.738 --> 05:18.553
Roger that.
Awaiting funyun.

05:19.106 --> 05:21.367
Funyun's under attack!
Funyun's under attack!

05:21.436 --> 05:23.120
Steady with
the funyun.

05:24.315 --> 05:27.305
Houston, the
funyun has landed.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.966
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

05:32.953 --> 05:33.968
What's going on?

05:34.009 --> 05:36.945
Eric flew a funyun
into my mouth.

05:38.170 --> 05:41.094
This is what's more important
than going to a party with me?

05:41.315 --> 05:43.087
Jackie, I think
you're overreacting...

05:44.047 --> 05:45.302
And, yes.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.584
You guys seriously
need to grow up.

05:49.065 --> 05:50.543
Okay,

05:51.025 --> 05:54.230
I think someone's a little mad that
we didn't fly a funyun into her mouth.

05:57.060 --> 05:59.373
Okay, Steven, I'm going
to that Christmas party,

05:59.420 --> 06:03.007
And if you don't come with me right
now, you are in so much trouble.

06:03.970 --> 06:05.191
Right now.

06:09.007 --> 06:11.212
I'm opening the door.

06:13.314 --> 06:16.261
I'm stepping outside.

06:18.304 --> 06:20.802
I'm closing the door.

06:23.268 --> 06:25.839
You are in so
much trouble!

06:31.743 --> 06:33.845
Yeah, I thought
Steven was maturing.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.334
He's out of high school,
he's got a job

06:36.557 --> 06:40.820
And lately he's even been taking
his sunglasses off inside the house.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.300
That's real
progress, Donna.

06:45.803 --> 06:49.009
Well, maybe what's going on with Hyde is the
same thing that's going on with my boyfriend,

06:49.041 --> 06:50.462
Lieutenant funyun.

06:51.296 --> 06:53.092
I bet it's that
stupid Kelso.

06:53.174 --> 06:55.206
He's always talking
them into having fun.

06:55.241 --> 06:57.951
Steven should not be having
fun. He should be with me.

07:01.403 --> 07:03.681
Okay, girls, time
to get to the party.

07:03.845 --> 07:06.485
Well, Jackie, look, I think Eric and Hyde
are feeling the pressures of life

07:06.531 --> 07:08.246
And they wanna
have one last blowout.

07:08.281 --> 07:11.651
Okay, Steven does not need a blowout.
He needs a kick in the nads.

07:13.551 --> 07:14.948
It's Christmas.

07:17.426 --> 07:19.786
At holiday time,
we say

07:19.833 --> 07:22.193
He needs a kick
in the sleigh bells.

07:29.841 --> 07:31.942
Kitty, these decorations
look awful.

07:31.978 --> 07:35.475
This isn't your living room.
Everything has to match.

07:36.837 --> 07:39.584
You should have mentioned
that to your plastic surgeon.

07:41.710 --> 07:45.193
Jackie Burkhart, welcome to
the Lopps Christmas party.

07:45.217 --> 07:46.649
Where's your boyfriend?

07:47.049 --> 07:48.634
Oh, um, he
can't be here.

07:48.692 --> 07:51.696
He's at rich
stockbroker school.

07:53.985 --> 07:57.132
Well, then I'm just gonna have to seat you
with the single ladies of Point Place.

07:57.414 --> 07:58.790
The Slopps?

08:00.985 --> 08:01.831
Ha!

08:02.089 --> 08:03.345
You're a slopp.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.383
Hey, there, hi, there,
ho, ho, ho, there.

08:10.101 --> 08:12.003
Patty Ryals?
It's me.

08:12.790 --> 08:15.444
Well, yes, Santa,
it's good to see you.

08:16.641 --> 08:18.954
Bob Pinciotti. We
went out that time.

08:19.048 --> 08:23.097
I didn't have the beard then, although
I think I wore a similar red jacket.

08:23.303 --> 08:26.811
Speaking of which, that's rented,
so try not to sweat through it.

08:28.232 --> 08:29.359
What a woman.

08:33.058 --> 08:36.250
Bad news, Kitty. I went by the police
station to pick up the toys.

08:36.273 --> 08:37.669
They've been stolen.

08:40.289 --> 08:41.839
- What?
- Yeah,

08:42.015 --> 08:44.628
Makes me think the police in
this town aren't that good.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.571
Red, getting those gifts here
was the only job Patty left me.

08:49.606 --> 08:51.707
Okay, you need to go home,
you need to find something,

08:51.723 --> 08:53.967
Anything, to wrap up and
give away at the party.

08:53.980 --> 08:55.360
Oh, fine,

08:55.400 --> 08:57.970
But this counts as one of
your Christmas presents.

08:58.650 --> 09:00.390
This is horrible,

09:00.700 --> 09:02.224
Taking toys
from children.

09:02.259 --> 09:04.326
What kind of monster
would do such a thing?

09:04.772 --> 09:06.850
Argh! I'm
a monster!

09:17.354 --> 09:18.951
It's broken already?

09:20.153 --> 09:22.301
This toy's stupid.

09:25.037 --> 09:27.139
Looks like somebody
needs a nappy-Nap.

09:28.442 --> 09:31.011
No. I wanna open
another present.

09:31.727 --> 09:33.054
Forman, just
take a rest.

09:33.078 --> 09:34.768
I'm not
tired, okay?

09:38.056 --> 09:39.535
Can I have a turn?

09:41.285 --> 09:42.682
I'm playing with it.

09:44.807 --> 09:46.334
You're supposed to share.

09:47.661 --> 09:49.009
I don't wanna.

09:51.017 --> 09:52.496
What the hell?

09:55.077 --> 09:57.202
Where did all
these toys come from?

10:04.447 --> 10:05.212
Well,

10:06.363 --> 10:08.970
Dad, I guess I'm just gonna
have to tell you the truth.

10:10.203 --> 10:11.776
It was Santa Claus.

10:19.236 --> 10:20.598
How could you do this?

10:20.621 --> 10:22.488
I told them it was
wrong. I told them.

10:24.238 --> 10:27.807
But then they drove a toy into my head,
and it was all blurry after that.

10:29.944 --> 10:34.887
These toys were for the needy kids
at your mother's party, you idiot.

10:35.345 --> 10:36.390
Oh, man.

10:37.638 --> 10:38.707
There's, uh,

10:39.276 --> 10:41.800
There's no chance that they
might want a raincoat, is there?

10:44.420 --> 10:45.360
Red,

10:45.759 --> 10:49.211
The thing is is that these toys
are too nice for the needy kids.

10:49.505 --> 10:52.264
You need to start them off
with something simple, like a

10:52.499 --> 10:53.720
A ball of yarn.

10:55.863 --> 10:56.696
Look,

10:56.779 --> 10:59.374
Dad, I think we can safely say that
none of this would have happened

10:59.409 --> 11:02.873
If you had just bought me an Evel
Knievel Stunt Cycle when I was younger.

11:05.350 --> 11:07.419
I bought you
one of those.

11:07.443 --> 11:10.120
Santa left it under
the tree that year when...

11:11.130 --> 11:12.398
Oh, wait.

11:16.000 --> 11:16.775
Okay,

11:17.162 --> 11:20.262
Eric's all tucked in, put out
carrots for the reindeer and

11:20.297 --> 11:22.493
A little wine
for Santa.

11:24.524 --> 11:26.191
Look at this thing
that I got for Eric.

11:26.955 --> 11:30.194
You rev up the bike,
and Evel Knievel goes flying.

11:30.217 --> 11:33.693
In real life, he's a moron,
but as a toy, he's awfully fun.

11:33.834 --> 11:36.135
Let me see if I can make
it over the garage.

11:40.830 --> 11:41.804
Go!

11:47.957 --> 11:48.696
Damn.

11:49.682 --> 11:51.948
I really thought I could
make it over the garage.

11:54.085 --> 11:56.234
Oh, well, everybody
makes mistakes.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.648
I'm gonna give you
a pass on this one.

12:00.683 --> 12:03.631
Just get these presents wrapped up
and over to the community center.

12:03.654 --> 12:05.274
Okay, yeah, we'll
take care of it, dad.

12:07.881 --> 12:08.726
All right,

12:09.724 --> 12:11.996
I think it's clear
what we gotta do.

12:12.031 --> 12:12.829
Yeah.

12:13.698 --> 12:16.821
Can we at least drive the Stunt Cycle
into Fez's head one more time?

12:19.581 --> 12:20.755
What  do you
say, buddy?

12:23.961 --> 12:24.701
Well,

12:25.229 --> 12:26.556
It is Christmas.

12:30.525 --> 12:33.364
- Set it up, boys.
- All right.

12:38.061 --> 12:38.986
All right, Kitty,

12:39.432 --> 12:42.790
I brought some stuff from the house
that I'm sure the kids are gonna love.

12:43.612 --> 12:45.162
A cheese grater?

12:47.637 --> 12:49.128
Kids love cheese.

12:49.328 --> 12:50.936
It's like
play-Doh to them.

12:52.592 --> 12:55.339
Look, don't worry. The real
presents are gonna be here soon.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.549
How do you know?

12:57.500 --> 13:00.132
Because you have
to believe, Kitty...

13:01.024 --> 13:01.999
Like me.

13:02.891 --> 13:04.735
Believe in
Christmas.

13:05.706 --> 13:08.595
We need to stall.
Read the kids a story.

13:08.900 --> 13:11.812
Well, I have a book in the car,
but it's about the Korean war.

13:13.350 --> 13:14.853
Well, go get it.

13:14.947 --> 13:19.242
Better those kids suffer emotional damage
than I look bad in front of the Lopps.

13:22.436 --> 13:23.586
Tell you what,

13:23.809 --> 13:27.644
Santa will bring you the bike for
Christmas if you go bring Santa a hoagie.

13:31.366 --> 13:34.501
You know what I'd really like
for Christmas? Patty Ryals.

13:35.722 --> 13:38.332
All you men ever think
about is what you want.

13:38.379 --> 13:40.105
What about
what we want?

13:40.586 --> 13:42.347
Boys never grow up.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.048
You know, one minute they agree
to go to a party with you, and the next,

13:45.083 --> 13:47.396
They're in a basement
full of stolen toys.

13:47.530 --> 13:48.815
And you're no better,

13:48.862 --> 13:51.345
Sitting there pretending
to be Santa Claus.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.012
You're not
Santa Claus?

13:54.785 --> 13:56.744
No. No,
no, he is.

13:56.978 --> 13:58.470
He is, it's
just that

13:58.869 --> 14:01.863
She is the
evil ice witch.

14:03.765 --> 14:05.864
Come on, let's get you
some grown up punch.

14:12.296 --> 14:13.001
Well,

14:13.940 --> 14:16.418
Can't bring these presents
through the front door.

14:16.652 --> 14:18.613
Looks like the chimney's
the only way in.

14:23.408 --> 14:24.970
I love being
on a rooftop.

14:25.005 --> 14:27.482
You can really see the whole
town spread out in front of you.

14:28.281 --> 14:30.359
It really is a crappy
town, isn't it?

14:32.567 --> 14:34.299
All right, who's gonna
take the plunge?

14:34.451 --> 14:35.520
Not me.

14:35.719 --> 14:38.209
If we were jumping off
the roof, I'd do it, but...

14:40.686 --> 14:42.518
This just
seems foolish.

14:45.836 --> 14:46.963
You know what?

14:47.656 --> 14:48.677
I'll do it.

14:48.959 --> 14:51.704
I always wanted to save the day
by sliding down a chimney.

14:51.857 --> 14:53.442
That opportunity
comes up

14:53.489 --> 14:55.191
Surprisingly
rarely.

14:55.661 --> 14:56.694
All right,

14:57.549 --> 14:59.240
I'm gonna do this.

15:00.273 --> 15:02.539
Okay, it looks like it
might be kind of a tight fit.

15:02.586 --> 15:04.815
I don't know if I'm gonna
fit all the way down!

15:13.920 --> 15:15.271
All right,

15:15.834 --> 15:18.018
Toss down the toys.

15:20.683 --> 15:24.221
It's okay, Forman. We're just gonna
sneak them in through the back door.

15:29.023 --> 15:30.672
There's a back door?

15:31.008 --> 15:32.863
Yeah, I saw it
on the way in.

15:35.094 --> 15:37.383
I just wanted to see one of
you guys go down the chimney.

15:39.319 --> 15:42.947
"Blood ran like a river that
day on heartbreak ridge."

15:44.356 --> 15:48.932
"Hundreds of soldiers had given their
lives and limbs trying to take..."

15:51.680 --> 15:54.498
Trying to take
the North Pole.

15:55.777 --> 15:57.454
"The North koreans..."

15:58.240 --> 16:01.141
The North Pole
Korean elves,

16:03.137 --> 16:06.295
"Were weary from
heaton that sun-Baked..."

16:06.460 --> 16:08.938
Snowy Christmas eve.

16:10.171 --> 16:12.637
Kitty, where
are the toys?

16:13.271 --> 16:14.609
Oh, um,

16:15.596 --> 16:18.783
This year in order
to build anticipation,

16:18.809 --> 16:20.629
I hid them
behind the curtain.

16:20.665 --> 16:23.277
You can't see them now,
not because they're not there,

16:23.301 --> 16:25.555
But because they're
behind the curtain...

16:26.905 --> 16:27.786
Hidden.

16:28.326 --> 16:31.942
Well, the children won't wait.
Gladys, open the curtain.

16:31.978 --> 16:33.997
No, no, no.
Wait, wait.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.556
Boys and girls,
I'm sorry.

16:35.591 --> 16:38.632
I'm just, you know, I think
Santa hasn't quite finished...

16:46.298 --> 16:48.000
Christmas

16:50.407 --> 16:52.403
Christmas

16:55.073 --> 16:57.072
Okay, kids,
go get 'em!

17:00.545 --> 17:03.207
Who was in charge of
giving out the toys here?

17:03.243 --> 17:04.369
It was Kitty.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.454
I think she's
been drinking.

17:07.106 --> 17:09.570
Well, it was perfect.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.569
The Lopps would like you
to run our Valentine's party.

17:14.637 --> 17:16.681
I'm in charge? Oh!

17:18.102 --> 17:18.935
Oh,

17:20.227 --> 17:22.587
This is the
same as

17:22.623 --> 17:27.814
Lyndon Johnson being sworn in on
the airplane after president Kennedy was...

17:28.224 --> 17:30.221
Well, that was
a tragedy, but

17:30.550 --> 17:32.205
I'm in charge.

17:32.933 --> 17:36.010
You hear that, Patty Ryals?
She's in charge,

17:36.057 --> 17:39.074
So you will be taking
orders from her.

17:40.303 --> 17:43.415
So put that in your
face lift and smoke it.

17:47.780 --> 17:48.825
Oh,

17:49.224 --> 17:50.622
Look at the
two of you.

17:50.669 --> 17:53.487
Isn't this just the
most special Christmas?

17:54.318 --> 17:55.504
Where's Eric?

17:55.609 --> 17:57.288
Yeah, um...

17:59.989 --> 18:01.010
Um,

18:01.809 --> 18:02.572
Yeah,

18:02.631 --> 18:04.460
Just a quick question.

18:04.965 --> 18:07.372
Um, where does that
chimney up on the roof go?

18:08.758 --> 18:09.955
Well, I'm
kind of a

18:10.002 --> 18:11.573
Chimney enthusiast.

18:12.454 --> 18:15.870
Oh, well, that goes into
the bakery next door.

18:18.381 --> 18:19.508
Hello?

18:21.551 --> 18:22.537
Hyde?

18:24.193 --> 18:25.543
Somebody?

18:28.596 --> 18:30.407
I'll be at
the bakery.

18:34.645 --> 18:37.381
Damn, that's a
nice crop of Slopps.

18:40.882 --> 18:43.242
Look at who decided
to finally show up.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.980
Jackie, are
you still mad?

18:45.191 --> 18:47.070
Come on, man, this
is not a big deal.

18:47.105 --> 18:49.545
I mean, six months ago, you would have
thought this was really funny.

18:49.686 --> 18:51.494
Yeah, six months ago.

18:51.835 --> 18:54.065
Steven, you can't
act like this forever.

18:54.112 --> 18:58.026
I need to know the guy I'm in love with
isn't gonna blow me off for a roomful of toys.

19:02.993 --> 19:05.482
That's not a guarantee
I can ever give you.

19:06.222 --> 19:09.335
Well, things are changing, Steven.
I mean, we're practically grown up.

19:09.370 --> 19:12.646
Yeah, and you know what? I'm
just trying to have a little fun before I

19:12.682 --> 19:15.077
Settle down and
life goes to crap.

19:16.004 --> 19:19.046
Is that what you think,
that life with me will be crap?

19:19.077 --> 19:20.157
That's not
what I said.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.635
No, it's okay. At least now
I know how you feel.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.525
Jackie...

19:28.247 --> 19:31.389
I'm sorry I don't
remember our date, Barry.

19:32.117 --> 19:33.209
It's Bob.

19:34.324 --> 19:35.193
But

19:35.531 --> 19:38.877
Since it is Christmas Eve
and we are both alone,

19:38.913 --> 19:40.498
Would you like
to get some dinner?

19:40.533 --> 19:42.318
I like the way
you're thinking.

19:44.091 --> 19:45.406
Or we could
skip dinner.

19:46.263 --> 19:48.570
Well, I'm more active
with a burger in me.

19:56.167 --> 19:58.878
Hey, Hyde, you and
Jackie fix things up?

19:58.936 --> 20:00.099
I don't know, man.

20:00.146 --> 20:04.065
If she wants to ruin Christmas, fine
by me, 'cause I am not playing her game.

20:05.322 --> 20:07.811
It's the stupid needy kids
who are playing games.

20:10.975 --> 20:12.842
They took all
of our games.

20:16.635 --> 20:20.368
Look what I found in the bakery
curled up in the fireplace.

20:23.127 --> 20:24.630
What the hell?

20:26.473 --> 20:28.187
You guys just
left me there.

20:28.763 --> 20:30.348
If I hadn't landed on,

20:30.982 --> 20:34.181
Well, some of the most delicious
baked goods that I ever tasted,

20:35.339 --> 20:37.289
I very well could
have starved to death.

20:38.568 --> 20:40.377
All right, man, I'll
make it up to you,

20:40.398 --> 20:42.465
'Cause I got a Christmas
present for everybody.

20:45.588 --> 20:47.478
This is one messed
up Christmas, man.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.684
You guys are all starting
to look like elves.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.181
That must have
freaked you out.

20:58.165 --> 20:59.339
It's gonna fall off.

20:59.374 --> 21:00.372
It's okay.

21:00.701 --> 21:03.192
Oh, my god. It
is gonna fall off.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.824
- It's okay.
- Okay.

21:07.208 --> 21:09.509
Let me give you my
recipe for holiday cheer...

21:09.533 --> 21:10.834
Take one slopp,

21:10.928 --> 21:12.877
Add half a bottle
of schnapps,

21:13.159 --> 21:15.836
Then stir freely
with Fez.

21:16.388 --> 21:18.302
It is a
wonderful life.

21:20.959 --> 21:24.212
- Merry Christmas, son.
- Oh, my god.

21:24.247 --> 21:27.382
You finally got me an Evel
Knievel Stunt Cycle.

21:29.211 --> 21:34.197
Ooh, you can go outside in
your new raincoat and give it a try.

21:38.261 --> 21:39.706
Ooh.

21:44.778 --> 21:47.338
Oh, Red, not again.

21:47.399 --> 21:50.616
Well, it's his own damn fault
for wanting a toy that's so fun.
