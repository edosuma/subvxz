00:12.012 --> 00:14.305
[narrator] <i>Previously on</i>
Star Trek Discovery:

00:14.389 --> 00:17.809
[Adira] There's a signal coming
from the center of the nebula.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.227
There's a ship lost in there.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.771
This is Dr. Aisa. We are stranded.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.357
The <i>Khi'eth </i>is still broadcasting
this distress signal.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.442
On a loop, sir.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.360
What is happening inside that ship?

00:27.444 --> 00:30.321
-I can help you.
-We have a way of doing things.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.491
So you want me to read the field manual?

00:33.575 --> 00:36.870
When we first arrived,
I, too, was eager to assist.

00:36.953 --> 00:41.875
Ultimately we had to wait
for our moment to prove ourselves.

00:41.958 --> 00:45.879
I trust you will find your moment,
as well, Mr. Booker.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.881
[Kovich] Temporal travel
can make you pretty sick.

00:47.964 --> 00:51.885
Every molecule fights
to either go back in time

00:51.968 --> 00:53.470
or jump a cosmic divide.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.097
[Culber] Every time we queried
the Sphere data for a treatment,

00:56.181 --> 00:58.475
it gave us the same result.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.977
Apparently, the cure can be found
on Dannus V.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.605
-[Carl] Well, look at that.
-What the hell is this?

01:03.688 --> 01:04.522
I'm Carl.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.274
[Burnham]
What if she goes through the door?

01:06.357 --> 01:08.902
-She'll be on the other side.
-Give me a straight answer.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.321
This is the chance
your computer was pointing us to.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.322
I'm taking it.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.909
[dramatic music playing]

01:15.992 --> 01:16.868
Terra firma!

01:16.951 --> 01:18.536
[Georgiou] Let me make myself clear.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.082
Lorca's coup will fail.
Michael will return to the fold.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.709
The path of what has been set
in motion will change,

01:24.793 --> 01:26.753
because I will change it.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.339
From now on, you will be my eyes and ears.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.884
Our future is unwritten.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.969
Let's make it count, shall we?

01:35.678 --> 01:37.430
Take her to the agonizer.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.602
[dramatic music playing]

01:58.493 --> 02:01.496
[Burnham groaning]

02:07.043 --> 02:07.961
[exhales]

02:09.254 --> 02:10.588
I should be dead.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.510
Kill me.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.846
Give me the honor I deserve.

02:17.929 --> 02:22.350
-You deserve many things.
-Then kill me for your own sake.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.979
Every moment you hesitate is a moment
that everyone can see

02:26.062 --> 02:27.897
how weak you've become.

02:27.981 --> 02:32.610
You're about
to find out how weak I've become.

02:34.195 --> 02:38.533
Why do you think Lorca has been able
to gather so many forces against you?

02:38.616 --> 02:40.285
Why do you think he got to me?

02:41.077 --> 02:42.996
You're rescuing Kelpiens.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.248
Fretting over artists.

02:45.331 --> 02:49.627
Half of your insipid death opera
was a lie.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.629
Propaganda to make you look strong.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.673
I know the truth.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.302
You're retiring to the <i>Charon.</i>

02:57.886 --> 02:59.512
You think I'm retiring?

03:00.263 --> 03:01.264
[scoffs]

03:01.347 --> 03:03.892
Why else would you
build a palace in the sky

03:03.975 --> 03:05.852
while we're still fighting on the ground?

03:06.519 --> 03:09.063
Are you really this blind, Michael?

03:09.147 --> 03:13.109
Or don't you want there to be
an empire left to rule after I'm gone?

03:13.610 --> 03:16.696
If we don't give our subjects something
to live for,

03:16.779 --> 03:19.115
they will always be in rebellion.

03:19.198 --> 03:23.161
How many revolts have we had
to quash this year alone?

03:23.953 --> 03:27.332
Twice as many as last year.

03:33.171 --> 03:37.425
Even Genghis Khan learned
his grip on power couldn't hold

03:37.508 --> 03:42.388
if he didn't let the people he conquered
worship their own gods.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.058
You promised us new worlds to conquer.

03:45.725 --> 03:49.229
You promised us spoils,
never-ending growth.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.358
There are no spoils from peace.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.323
You have a lot to learn, Michael.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.705
[groans] You're the one who's blind.

04:09.332 --> 04:13.461
Even now, the Romulans, the Andorians,
the Tellarites, the Klingons,

04:13.544 --> 04:16.047
they're forming an alliance to destroy us.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.301
It's called the Coalition.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.931
And the Denobulans and the Rigelians
and the Coridanites will follow.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.641
You should attack now.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.894
We can't defeat the whole galaxy
if they unite against us.

04:29.978 --> 04:34.107
They would think twice about alliances
if we flew down and roasted them on spits.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.028
The rules of engagement are changing.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.447
No, Mother, no!

04:41.531 --> 04:43.283
I will kill all of you!

04:44.951 --> 04:48.246
I will kill all of you!

04:49.747 --> 04:52.667
This is the orison
of every parent, Michael,

04:52.750 --> 04:55.169
as I hoped you would learn someday.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.964
Why can't they just believe what I say?

05:01.050 --> 05:03.303
[Burnham grunting]

05:04.387 --> 05:06.389
[screaming]

05:09.058 --> 05:11.185
Why do they only learn from pain?

05:11.602 --> 05:13.313
[screaming continues]

05:16.774 --> 05:17.900
[door chimes]

05:17.984 --> 05:18.818
[Georgiou] Come.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.903
[Burnham groaning]

05:20.987 --> 05:21.988
[door opens]

05:25.074 --> 05:26.159
[door closes]

05:28.328 --> 05:29.787
Emperor, if I may,

05:29.871 --> 05:33.124
why is Michael Burnham
still using up oxygen on my ship?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.503
You could kill her
with the press of a button.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.089
She's a traitor.
She doesn't deserve mercy.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.966
She isn't getting any.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.302
What shows more strength?

05:44.385 --> 05:47.138
A mother who simply kills her daughter,

05:47.221 --> 05:50.975
or a mother who locks her daughter
in an agonizer booth

05:51.059 --> 05:53.895
in order
to change the course of the future?

05:53.978 --> 05:56.314
We still need to find
and deal with her accomplices.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.524
Detmer, I'm sure, knew of her plans.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.486
No better message to send
to her co-conspirators

06:01.569 --> 06:04.072
than a broken Michael Burnham

06:04.155 --> 06:07.658
who has been re-forged
into a loyal subject,

06:07.742 --> 06:09.452
thanks to you.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.578
Me?

06:10.661 --> 06:14.207
You are the most feared interrogator
in the quadrant.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.335
I must be given free rein.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.336
Of course.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.837
Do your worst.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.755
Or best.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.799
But I expect her to live.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.927
And if you don't break her,

06:26.010 --> 06:28.387
I will demand to know why.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.807
Michael will come around.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.187
[door opens]

06:38.856 --> 06:40.108
-[Burnham groans]
-[door closes]

06:41.901 --> 06:44.529
Even the darkest night will end...

06:46.531 --> 06:48.950
and the sun will rise.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.286
Come back to me, daughter.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.372
[dramatic music playing]

06:57.875 --> 06:59.877
[theme music playing]

08:28.382 --> 08:30.384
[dramatic music playing]

08:36.140 --> 08:37.975
Your mother is too softhearted.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.478
<i>I told her you wouldn't have an appetite.</i>

08:42.396 --> 08:43.397
<i>It's okay.</i>

08:43.481 --> 08:45.900
I'll have Dr. Culber force-feed you later.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.611
[grunting]

08:49.028 --> 08:51.280
Whatever you do, you won't break me.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.162
Swear your allegiance to Emperor Georgiou,

08:58.246 --> 09:00.373
and name your coconspirators.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.501
Rot in hell, bitch. [panting]

09:06.879 --> 09:07.713
[screaming]

09:14.804 --> 09:18.558
We'll try again tomorrow.
You don't mind sleeping in there, do you?

09:24.689 --> 09:28.192
[Georgiou] <i>I wish there were</i>
<i>another language you could understand.</i>

09:29.986 --> 09:33.155
<i>But here, where strength is power...</i>

09:33.239 --> 09:34.824
[alarm blaring]

09:34.907 --> 09:36.909
<i>...and terror is love,</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:39.537
<i>there is no other way to reach you.</i>

09:42.373 --> 09:44.375
[dramatic music playing]

[Burnham screaming]

09:51.966 --> 09:53.968
<i>I've seen who you can be, Michael.</i>

09:55.511 --> 09:57.096
<i>I've seen who I can be.</i>

09:58.598 --> 10:00.474
<i>I've seen what this world can be.</i>

10:01.601 --> 10:03.269
<i>And it is luminous.</i>

10:05.646 --> 10:06.647
<i>We can have that.</i>

10:07.481 --> 10:09.108
<i>We can be more.</i>

10:09.900 --> 10:13.571
<i>But first we must remake ourselves.</i>

10:14.196 --> 10:15.072
[grunts]

10:19.869 --> 10:24.081
<i>We must leave behind</i>
<i>all of that which destroys us.</i>

10:24.165 --> 10:24.999
Captain?

10:26.542 --> 10:27.376
Detmer?

10:28.711 --> 10:29.545
What...?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.549
I asked to see you.

10:34.383 --> 10:37.470
They're... listening.

10:38.846 --> 10:39.680
[Detmer] <i>I know.</i>

10:42.892 --> 10:43.768
<i>Why?</i>

10:44.894 --> 10:46.562
You have to give in.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.231
You can't endure much more of this.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.650
Nobody could.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.652
Lorca.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.156
No one has heard from Lorca.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.788
I don't think he's coming.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.419
You are the best of us.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.672
There is no sense dying in here.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.593
Come out.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.595
It's time to end this.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.525
[Georgiou] <i>I believe</i>
<i>you can do this, Michael.</i>

11:35.361 --> 11:37.530
I believe you can change.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.451
As I have.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.416
Do you remember when you were a child?

11:49.041 --> 11:52.211
You hardly spoke during the day.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.921
But at night,

11:55.214 --> 11:56.465
you'd scream,

11:57.299 --> 11:59.927
fighting in your sleep to escape.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.681
I would hold you down as you struggled.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.101
One night,

12:08.769 --> 12:09.770
I let you go.

12:11.814 --> 12:16.902
And you ended up sleepwalking
into a field of fireflies.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.280
You stood there

12:19.363 --> 12:21.699
until you became calm,

12:23.576 --> 12:25.744
and I could carry you to your bed.

12:28.456 --> 12:33.377
I walked with you every night
to that field after that.

12:34.336 --> 12:38.299
And when you woke up the next day,
you never remembered.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.428
I was sad when you
outgrew your night terrors.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.684
Now when I think about it,

12:49.935 --> 12:51.312
maybe you never did.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.411
If you'll trust me...

13:09.914 --> 13:16.295
I will bring all the fireflies to you,
daughter.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.465
[dramatic music playing]

14:41.213 --> 14:42.172
Yes, Michael?

14:43.007 --> 14:44.216
You asked to see me?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.886
[dramatic music playing]

14:50.764 --> 14:51.599
Mother.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.269
Leave us.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.826
I am sorry.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.329
Get off the floor.

15:17.082 --> 15:17.917
Look at me.

15:21.128 --> 15:24.048
It's about more than the show of strength.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.343
We have an empire to rule.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.013
All I ever wanted was to rule it with you.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.141
I pledge my loyalty to you, Emperor.

15:35.976 --> 15:39.980
And I vow to name my coconspirators
and expose them.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.817
I'm glad to hear that.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.363
But you don't just need
to make amends with me.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.407
You need to make amends

15:50.491 --> 15:51.992
with all our subjects.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.662
How are they ever to trust you?

15:57.373 --> 16:00.042
I will execute the traitors
with my own hands.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.629
No foe will remain.

16:05.339 --> 16:08.175
Detmer can assist you.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.678
Thank you, Mother.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.179
Go.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.723
And be quick about it.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.811
You...

16:19.520 --> 16:20.354
You...

16:22.898 --> 16:24.400
You can trust me again.

16:32.783 --> 16:36.662
Don't come back
until you've proven yourself.

18:08.670 --> 18:09.963
Yes, Emperor.

Michael?

-The kitchen no longer serves Kelpien.
-Is that a problem?

18:54.216 --> 18:56.135
Just takes some getting used to.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.971
I was craving ganglia in my cell.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.725
The Kelpien flesh is too high
in cholesterol,

19:03.809 --> 19:06.186
and it's stringy.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.272
Isn't that right?

19:08.939 --> 19:10.607
That is right, Emperor.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.156
[suspenseful music playing]

19:17.906 --> 19:19.616
[door closes]

19:20.200 --> 19:23.745
I never lost faith
that you would see the error of your ways.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.456
I came to the light weeks ago.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.168
And yet you remained in the brig.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.046
-Stubborn.
-Like mother, like daughter.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.382
I heard you made changes.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.052
You used backchannels
to sabotage the Coalition.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.470
That wasn't hard.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.682
Those silly democratic things are always
on the brink.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.225
But you heard me.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.813
About the threats you didn't foresee.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.274
I've always been able to hear the truth.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.485
And I expect you
to tell it to me from now on.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.321
I will.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.907
-Where's Lorca?
-I don't know.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.659
-Are you still in love with him?
-He left me for dead.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.661
That's not a no.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.664
When we find him,

20:09.416 --> 20:10.918
I'll be able to kill him.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.045
How do we find him?

20:14.379 --> 20:17.716
The alias he uses
on interstellar communication is Vicar.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.720
He chose the name Vicar for himself?

20:21.803 --> 20:23.639
It means "substitute."

20:23.722 --> 20:26.350
Lorca was always an underachiever.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.143
Go find him, daughter.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.896
So long as he lives,
we will always be at war.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.325
Is something amiss, Emperor?

20:45.285 --> 20:46.119
Not at all.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.581
Everything is unfolding as I'd hoped.

20:53.669 --> 20:59.049
You and Captain Burnham have come
quite a long way over these last months.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.218
You must be pleased.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.222
I'd only ever wished to rule with her.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.809
And now I shall.

21:10.894 --> 21:14.523
You will remain with me,
rather than return to her service.

21:16.900 --> 21:21.029
I am afraid
that will not be possible, Emperor,

21:21.113 --> 21:22.239
in the end.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.576
I regret that
I will not remain here with you.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.288
Vahar'ai is coming for me.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.831
Who told you that?

21:30.914 --> 21:31.748
I feel it.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.834
[dramatic music playing]

21:34.835 --> 21:38.297
It would do me the greatest honor
if you would be the one to cull me.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.173
I will do no such thing.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.843
I apologize for overstepping.
I never should have--

21:42.926 --> 21:44.219
Vahar'ai...

21:45.220 --> 21:47.431
is not an end.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.476
Emperor?

21:51.560 --> 21:54.521
When the madness comes,
lock yourself away.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.523
In a few days' time,

21:56.606 --> 21:58.692
you will still be alive,

21:58.775 --> 22:00.736
and you will be changed forever.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.406
But that is merely a fable.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.242
I have witnessed it myself.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.078
How is that possible?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.043
I knew a Kelpien once.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.087
In another time,

22:19.171 --> 22:20.630
another place.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.176
His name was Saru.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.847
He survived Vahar'ai.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.558
And it made him stronger.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.438
He was a captain of a starship.

22:37.564 --> 22:41.651
You must have traveled
far beyond the Empire.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.407
You are placing a great deal
of trust in me.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.910
My corpse would already be eaten to bones

22:49.993 --> 22:54.748
if I could not accurately judge
between loyalty and flattery.

22:55.665 --> 22:59.586
Your regret was genuine
when you thought you were leaving me here.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.672
As was your pain when your comrade fell.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.426
He...

23:07.219 --> 23:08.178
He would have...

23:09.638 --> 23:12.599
-My sister, my family, they would still--
-Survive.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.018
That is how you honor them.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.605
Teach others what you know.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.274
That is how you avenge them.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.946
You are not Terran.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.990
Of course, I am.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.826
-The way you speak--
-Enough.

23:30.909 --> 23:31.743
Please.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.497
Return to where you are from, Emperor.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.416
Should you fail
to do what is expected of you,

23:38.500 --> 23:39.626
they will kill you.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.711
This is my home.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.631
Now and forever.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.177
And I will make it what it needs to be.

23:51.012 --> 23:54.015
That is how I will survive.

23:56.518 --> 23:57.853
Do you understand?

23:58.770 --> 24:02.274
I believe so, Emperor.

24:02.357 --> 24:03.608
Leave me to my bath.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.033
[device chirping]

24:24.296 --> 24:26.298
[dramatic music playing]

24:30.510 --> 24:32.804
Got it. A coded message sent to Vicar.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.682
-Who sent it?
-Someone by the alias Carnelian.

24:35.765 --> 24:39.186
That's Duggan,
one of Lorca's top lieutenants.

24:39.269 --> 24:43.565
-Where did the message originate?
-Risa. Just six hours ago.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.192
He might still be there.

24:45.275 --> 24:49.321
Captain Killy, set a course for Risa,
warp nine.

24:49.404 --> 24:53.700
Respectfully, hunting down a mercenary
doesn't seem worthy of the Emperor's time.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.870
I'll go with Burnham
aboard a shuttlecraft.

24:57.954 --> 24:58.788
No.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.498
I'll go.

25:00.582 --> 25:01.958
Might be fun.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.084
As you wish.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.463
Commander Nilsson, maximum warp.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.380
Yes, captain.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.353
We've arrived.
Entering Risa's orbit now, captain.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.730
Scan the area for nearby vessels.

25:23.813 --> 25:26.024
Sensors show
a single Class-A shuttlecraft.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.485
No other warp-capable vessels
within 100 light-years.

25:28.568 --> 25:29.611
I want to see it.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.657
It's Duggan.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.991
Cheap bastard.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.452
Still hasn't gotten
his shuttle fixed properly.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.162
-Any life signs?
-Just one.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.081
Might still be a trap, Emperor.

25:41.164 --> 25:45.210
No signs of Lorca,
and Duggan is in the middle of nowhere.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.463
He knows we're here. Vessel's powering up.

25:48.546 --> 25:51.341
Disable that ship. Keep him alive.

25:54.886 --> 25:55.971
Direct hit.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.722
Incoming transmission.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.474
As if he had another choice.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.727
Put him through, Commander Airiam.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.941
Mr. Duggan, I presume.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.818
<i>I just got my engines rebuilt.</i>

26:09.901 --> 26:13.029
Now you can rebuild them again.
Practice makes perfect, so I'm told.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.656
Where is Lorca?

26:14.739 --> 26:15.949
<i>Making new friends.</i>

26:16.032 --> 26:17.409
Is that so?

26:17.492 --> 26:19.494
<i>While you've wasted time</i>
<i>on trade alliances,</i>

26:19.577 --> 26:22.414
<i>trying to stop some ridiculous coalition,</i>

26:22.497 --> 26:25.083
guess who's rallied the Klingons
and Romulans against you.

26:25.166 --> 26:28.003
The Klingons and Romulans
despise one another.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.672
<i>Not as much as they despise you.</i>

26:30.755 --> 26:34.509
<i>Lorca promised your head on a spike.</i>
<i>Can't wait to see it.</i>

26:34.592 --> 26:35.969
That will be difficult,

26:36.052 --> 26:39.556
after I remove your eyes
and his heart with my bare hands.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.182
Where is he?

26:41.266 --> 26:43.643
<i>Don't expect me to answer that, do you?</i>

26:43.727 --> 26:45.353
He's powering his transporters.

26:45.437 --> 26:49.357
You think we'd be that stupid
to let you get down to the surface?

26:49.441 --> 26:52.152
Take out what's left of his ship.
I want him on board.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.070
-Open fire.
-[Bryce] Aye, captain.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.989

[Burnham] Transport Duggan directly
to the brig. Have Culber meet us there.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.206
He won't give up Lorca easily.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.042
-Stay alert.
-[Killy] Of course, Emperor.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.337
Bring the Honor Guard as well.
We don't wanna take any chances.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.673
If you're having second thoughts...

27:13.757 --> 27:15.091
I'm not, Mother.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.217
I promise you.

27:37.405 --> 27:39.491
In person, you're not so terrifying.

I'll be damned.

The snake wriggled out of her cage.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.208
Can't trust this one, Emperor.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.085
[Burnham] Of course you can,

28:04.349 --> 28:06.309

I knew you were on to me
at the christening of the <i>Charon.</i>

28:10.313 --> 28:13.274
And I really thought you would kill me,
but then...

28:15.902 --> 28:17.404
Never ceases to amaze me...

28:22.492 --> 28:24.244
When we must.

Another way to rule.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.438
There is no other way.

There's an iron fist, and there's death.

You never should have trusted me.

Tell me.

33:26.963 --> 33:27.880
[Georgiou groaning]

33:27.964 --> 33:31.175
No. You said,
going through the door would help her.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.885
Can't just live in doorways.

33:33.636 --> 33:34.554
Who are you?

33:35.513 --> 33:36.514
Really?

33:36.597 --> 33:37.432
[Carl] Really?

33:39.058 --> 33:43.021
[in deep voice] I am
the Guardian of Forever.

33:59.912 --> 34:05.626
The Kelpiens crashed in the middle
of a radioactive nebula 125 years ago.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.881
Maybe we can't hack into their system
because there is no system left to hack.

34:09.964 --> 34:13.217
Something is still sending out
that distress call on repeat.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.677
We need more power.

34:14.761 --> 34:18.347
Rerouting an additional 10 percent
from nonessential systems.

34:18.431 --> 34:21.893
Stop stealing my power supply.

34:21.976 --> 34:25.730
I haven't seen you since the dawn of time.
Where the hell have you been?

34:25.813 --> 34:27.482
Realizing my lifelong dream

34:27.565 --> 34:32.028
of taking us from plasma
to fully polaric warp conduits.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.780
And I was yea close,

34:33.863 --> 34:38.117
until you two geniuses sucked the power
out of my backup cells.

34:38.201 --> 34:41.537
This is important.
Saru gave us eminent allocation clearance.

34:41.621 --> 34:42.455
For what?

34:42.538 --> 34:44.791
We're using long-range sensors

34:44.874 --> 34:47.376
to hack into the crashed ship.

34:48.252 --> 34:51.214
-You're not allowed to have food in here.
-This isn't food.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.298
It's candy.

34:52.381 --> 34:54.133
It's practically an accessory.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.470
I've got it. Figured out why
you couldn't hack into the ship.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.430
[dramatic music playing]

34:59.514 --> 35:01.432
-What are you--?
-I read the field manual.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.559
Your static is
at the space-subspace barrier.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.603
That's why you're using all your juice.

35:05.686 --> 35:08.356
-None of this is in the field manual.
-[Book] It got interesting,

35:08.439 --> 35:10.942
so I moved onto the technical manuals
to see what happened next.

35:11.025 --> 35:14.445
I found out that you don't know
you can amplify signals within subspace.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.614
-Not allowed food in here.
-[Adira] You...

35:16.697 --> 35:17.907
-You can do that?
-[Book] Mm-hm.

35:17.990 --> 35:21.744
Couriers travel to pockets of the galaxy
with few subspace relays.

35:21.828 --> 35:24.413
We use range extenders
to amplify weak signals.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.125
So, this is an Emerald Chain tool?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.961
One of the benefits
of doing business with them.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.672
Oh, captain said, make myself useful.

35:33.548 --> 35:34.799
I made myself useful.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.094
It worked.

35:38.719 --> 35:41.222
Our sensors are holding a link
to the ship.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.598
We're gathering data now.

35:42.682 --> 35:46.144
Well, I mean,
if I'd had Emerald Chain technology...

35:46.227 --> 35:49.522
-You could just say thank you.
-[Reno] Biologically impossible.

35:49.605 --> 35:53.776
If he tried, his DNA would unravel
like a hormonal teenager.

35:55.611 --> 35:57.071
I need to update Saru.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.369
[Burnham] What's a Guardian of Forever?
Why haven't we heard of you?

36:03.452 --> 36:09.458
[in normal voice] I'm in hiding.
I'm a space-time portal, you might say.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.837
Back in the day, used to be,
"Sure, come through.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.673
Just don't screw up history,
or you'll have to fix it."

36:16.215 --> 36:18.593
And then the Temporal Wars happened,

36:18.676 --> 36:21.179
and everyone was killing everyone else,

36:21.262 --> 36:24.473
and trying to use me to do it.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.728
[exhales] Wasn't pretty.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.354
But here I am.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.648
Officially elsewhere,

36:33.232 --> 36:35.443
nowhere near my original coordinates.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.488
Ha. Only an intelligence
with over 100,000 years of history

36:39.572 --> 36:43.951
and access to current Federation databases
could possibly extrapolate your location.

36:44.035 --> 36:44.869
I like that.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.205
The Sphere data.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.207
-For all the good it's done me.
-[device whirring]

36:49.290 --> 36:50.833
[groaning]

36:54.670 --> 36:56.005
I'm still dying.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.381
Why?

36:57.465 --> 36:59.675
You weren't sent back to be cured.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.719
You were sent back to be weighed.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.095
Weighed?

37:03.179 --> 37:05.723
Tested to see
if she'd make different choices.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.976
To see if this time here
had changed her at all.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.187
[Georgiou] Why didn't you just tell me?

37:11.270 --> 37:13.940
What, and give you the answer
before the test?

37:14.482 --> 37:16.317
You're a tricky case, Philippa.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.320
You don't belong here now.

37:19.403 --> 37:23.532
But to send you somewhere else
might cause just as many problems.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.326
So, you had to be weighed.

37:26.827 --> 37:29.288
To figure out your course.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.748
Well, let me guess.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.334
I was found to be lacking.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.752
Why would you say that?

37:34.835 --> 37:37.255
I killed my daughter again.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.757
But in fairness, your hands were tied.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.634
The end was the same.

37:41.717 --> 37:42.635
But you tried.

37:42.718 --> 37:43.886
I failed.

37:43.970 --> 37:44.804
Her.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.430
The Empire.

37:47.181 --> 37:48.015
Yeah.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.187
But, you know, this time through,

37:54.605 --> 37:56.482
you tried for peace.

37:56.565 --> 37:58.025
You saved a Kelpien.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.945
And you didn't have to do that.

38:01.028 --> 38:02.363
And he'll save others.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.073
A lot of them.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.117
So, you will help her?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.671
[Carl] It's ready when you are.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.214
No.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.758
I won't return to Terra.

38:22.842 --> 38:23.676
Oh, come on.

38:23.759 --> 38:26.304
No one said anything
about sending you back there.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.347
I'm gonna send you back to a time

38:28.431 --> 38:32.059
when the mirror universe
and the prime universe were still aligned.

38:33.769 --> 38:35.855
That's so you won't fall apart,

38:35.938 --> 38:37.148
atomically speaking.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.776
Consider yourself lucky.
You get a second shot.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.570
I mean, that's pretty unique.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.030
But it won't be easy.

38:44.113 --> 38:48.242
The paper says
the forecast will be bumpy and painful.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.704
Lots of rainstorms, heartaches.

38:51.787 --> 38:53.873
But that's life.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.042
Or so I'm told.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.419
Can Michael come with me?

38:58.502 --> 38:59.337
Afraid not.

39:00.087 --> 39:03.966
This Michael Burnham is right
where she needs to be.

39:10.806 --> 39:11.891
When you're ready,

39:12.725 --> 39:14.602
just walk on through.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.324
Philippa.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.409
-Listen.
-No.

39:30.993 --> 39:31.827
You listen.

39:32.953 --> 39:37.583
I said you sentenced me to death
when you brought me to this universe.

39:37.666 --> 39:41.337
In truth,
the greater part of me was already dead.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.424
You gave me new life.

39:47.134 --> 39:50.429
And the rest of your crew
isn't so bad either.

39:52.223 --> 39:57.061
I've seen
that some endings are inevitable.

39:57.144 --> 40:00.064
Mine, Captain Burnham's.

40:00.856 --> 40:04.527
And perhaps your Philippa was destined
for her end as well.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.240
You are my Philippa.

40:10.157 --> 40:11.283
Michael.

40:12.034 --> 40:14.578
I mean, what I feel for you...

40:17.039 --> 40:18.666
belongs to you.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.209
No one else.

40:21.710 --> 40:25.464
I wish I'd learned all this before now.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.094
I had a chance once,

40:31.095 --> 40:32.012
long ago.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.599
He was called Husan.

40:37.351 --> 40:39.854
I wish I told you about him.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.857
Tell the people you're about to meet now.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.906
I will never find another like you.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.079
I don't think I will either.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.583
But we owe it to ourselves to try.

41:13.679 --> 41:14.513
Go.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.516
Before it's too late.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.405
This era is different.

41:32.239 --> 41:34.450
More Terran than where you came from.

41:35.034 --> 41:38.537
Saru has navigated <i>Discovery</i> admirably,

41:38.621 --> 41:42.583
but he's not the only one
who's suited for the captain's chair.

41:44.293 --> 41:49.632
You have always been far greater
than you could imagine, Michael.

41:51.258 --> 41:52.593
So have you, Philippa.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.722
[dramatic music playing]

42:25.376 --> 42:26.585
[dramatic music playing]

42:26.669 --> 42:29.922
[Saru] We have established a link
with the Kelpien ship, admiral.

42:30.005 --> 42:31.340
Data is starting to come in.

42:31.423 --> 42:34.218
I'm glad to hear that.
But using Chain technology

42:34.301 --> 42:37.012
on a Starfleet ship is a stretch,

42:37.096 --> 42:41.267
even by the lax standards you
and Commander Burnham adhere to.

42:42.685 --> 42:46.605
Well, to be fair, admiral,
Commander Burnham is settling,

42:46.689 --> 42:49.233
proving to be
all the more effective as a result.

42:49.316 --> 42:51.652
And without Mr. Booker's assistance,

42:51.735 --> 42:54.780
we would have been unable
to access the <i>Khi'eth's</i> systems.

42:54.863 --> 42:57.324
Did it occur to either of you
that using this tech

42:57.408 --> 42:59.326
could compromise <i>Discovery's</i> systems?

42:59.410 --> 43:00.869
It's safe.

43:00.953 --> 43:04.206
I made sure of that before I installed it
on my own ship two years ago.

43:04.290 --> 43:07.960
Mr. Booker's tool provided
a needed solution for our objective.

43:08.711 --> 43:11.255
An objective you approved, admiral.

43:11.338 --> 43:14.842
Osyraa is desperate for dilithium.

43:15.884 --> 43:19.054
<i>Discovery</i> has a spore drive.
It's not a good combination.

43:19.138 --> 43:22.182
You're going to have
to be exceptionally careful at all times.

43:24.768 --> 43:27.229
If you would like to remain on <i>Discovery,</i>

43:27.313 --> 43:29.815
you will need
to follow Starfleet protocol.

43:29.898 --> 43:32.568
With all due respect,
Osyraa has no protocols.

43:33.193 --> 43:36.822
Having someone like me around
who's not part of Starfleet could be good.

43:37.364 --> 43:38.282
[alarm chimes]

43:39.783 --> 43:43.078
[sighs] Commander Burnham is beaming back
to <i>Discovery.</i>

43:43.662 --> 43:44.663
Alone?

43:49.209 --> 43:51.712
-We can continue this later.
-Excuse me.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.220
His actions didn't bother you?

44:00.304 --> 44:01.764
He was trying to help.

44:01.847 --> 44:03.140
Like you were trying to help

44:03.223 --> 44:06.477
by delaying your reports on the <i>Khi'eth</i>
until you had more data?

44:06.560 --> 44:09.104
I did not wish
to present you with pure conjecture.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.023
Here's what I see.

44:11.732 --> 44:15.361
I have a Kelpien research vessel
that crashed before the Burn,

44:15.444 --> 44:19.865
and a captain who hasn't seen
another Kelpien face since he got here.

44:19.948 --> 44:22.493
I wouldn't blame you
if you were distracted.

44:23.952 --> 44:25.496
I just need you to say so.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.832
I assure you, admiral,
that is not the case.

44:30.334 --> 44:31.168
Right.

44:31.835 --> 44:34.588
Commander Stamets
and Adira have permission

44:34.672 --> 44:37.675
to use Mr. Booker's tech
under supervision.

44:37.758 --> 44:40.010
But the second you know
what's inside the <i>Khi'eth,</i>

44:40.094 --> 44:41.053
I want a report.

44:41.136 --> 44:41.970
Of course.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.933
-Will there be anything else?
-Yes.

44:46.975 --> 44:48.519
My condolences, Saru.

44:50.187 --> 44:52.398
I know you will all feel her absence.

45:03.242 --> 45:05.285
[Book] Michael. Hey.

45:09.456 --> 45:10.499
I'm so sorry.

45:21.176 --> 45:22.010
Gone?

45:22.719 --> 45:25.180
As in deceased?

45:30.477 --> 45:32.104
She will not return?

45:33.939 --> 45:34.773
Never.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.029
Then she is deceased.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.121
[tapping on glass]

45:49.830 --> 45:51.081
To Philippa Georgiou,

45:51.957 --> 45:55.210
the most stubborn patient I've ever had.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.796
Considering what some of you
have put me through,

45:57.880 --> 45:59.214
that's saying a lot.

46:01.216 --> 46:03.927
-I wish I could have done more.
-You tried.

46:04.011 --> 46:05.345
And she knew that,

46:05.429 --> 46:07.806
even if she bit your head off
every chance she got.

46:09.099 --> 46:10.350
To Philippa Georgiou.

46:11.059 --> 46:13.228
She was tough.

46:13.312 --> 46:16.565
She was a force to be reckoned with.

46:16.648 --> 46:19.860
And she pretty much redefined
the word "badass."

46:19.943 --> 46:23.071
Oh, and can I just add
that she had the best walk?

46:23.155 --> 46:25.449
With that coat and those boots.

46:25.532 --> 46:29.495
And... nothing intimidated her.

46:29.578 --> 46:30.829
Not in any universe.

46:30.913 --> 46:32.956
She had no tact,

46:33.040 --> 46:35.667
and, God, I loved that about her.

46:35.751 --> 46:38.170
She was always honest.

46:39.213 --> 46:40.631
Punishingly so.

46:40.714 --> 46:41.965
Her barbs,

46:42.049 --> 46:43.717
however piercing,

46:43.800 --> 46:45.969
were utterly glorious.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.554
She was a pain in the ass.

46:47.638 --> 46:48.931
[all laugh]

46:53.602 --> 46:56.855
And she meant more to me
than I could ever put in words.

46:58.941 --> 47:00.776
Georgiou was the wall...

47:01.860 --> 47:04.488
I crashed into,
over and over and over again.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.533
She was a tormentor.

47:09.159 --> 47:11.119
But a truth-teller.

47:13.247 --> 47:15.958
She was a mirror I never knew I needed.

47:19.002 --> 47:20.254
Like a mother almost.

47:23.006 --> 47:24.591
Like a sister almost.

47:27.803 --> 47:28.720
I loved her.

47:30.556 --> 47:31.723
And hated her.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.560
Sometimes both at the same time.

47:39.731 --> 47:41.984
More than anything, she was my friend.

47:45.404 --> 47:47.823
She was the most unexpected of gifts.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.077
And I will miss the hell out of her.

47:53.787 --> 47:54.621
To Philippa.

47:55.455 --> 47:56.915
[all] To Philippa.

48:04.423 --> 48:06.425
