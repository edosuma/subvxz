00:06.005 --> 00:08.925
[Princess Carolyn] <i>I got into</i>
<i>this business because I love stories.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:11.344
They comfort us, they inspire us,

00:11.428 --> 00:14.472
they create a context
for how we experience the world.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.266
But also, you have to be careful,

00:16.349 --> 00:18.601
because if you spend
a lot of time with stories,

00:18.685 --> 00:22.814
you start to believe that life
is just stories, and it's not.

00:22.897 --> 00:26.234
Life is life, and that's so sad,

00:26.317 --> 00:29.154
because there's so little time and...

00:29.237 --> 00:30.780
what are we doing with it?

00:30.864 --> 00:33.450
-[clocks ticking]
-Thank you.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.201
When Princess Carolyn told me

00:35.285 --> 00:37.912
we were pitching
to whattimeisitrightnow.com,

00:37.996 --> 00:39.205
I was excited,

00:39.289 --> 00:43.626
because in so many ways,
the story I'm about to tell is about time.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.838
And it's about time this story was told.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.506
-Ooh!
-Ahh!

00:48.590 --> 00:53.052
[Flip] <i>It's about Detective John Philbert,</i>
<i>a man from another time.</i>

00:54.929 --> 00:56.056
[sighs]

00:56.139 --> 00:58.767
[Flip] <i>But now he finds himself</i>
<i>in a new time.</i>

00:58.850 --> 01:03.188
-I'm sorry, did you say newt time?
-No, no, new time.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.066
Oh, so it's not like a time full of newts?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.233
No.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.110
Unless you want it to be
a time full of newts.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.697
-No, no, no, no. I'm just clarifying.
-Okay.

01:12.781 --> 01:16.076
He finds himself in a time
he doesn't understand.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.121
-[sighs]
-[phone dialing]

01:20.205 --> 01:22.916
-[man] <i>Don't call this number again.</i>
-Wait. I-- I just--

01:22.999 --> 01:25.335
My mother, she's senile,
and she was drugging the coffee.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.628
That's why-- Just--

01:26.711 --> 01:29.255
I wanted you to know that
none of this was Hollyhock's fault.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.590
[man] <i>Goodbye, BoJack.</i>

01:30.673 --> 01:33.968
[Flip] <i>A time in which he is alone.</i>

01:34.052 --> 01:37.931
<i>Perhaps, all this time,</i>
<i>he's been alone.</i>

01:38.014 --> 01:41.226
-Except for the newts, right?
-Hmm.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.061
Yeah. Except for the newts.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.816
[theme music playing]

02:39.742 --> 02:43.371
And then it dawns on him,
his partner isn't a ghost.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.497
Or is he?

02:44.581 --> 02:47.041
-Wow!
-As we like to say here,

02:47.125 --> 02:50.003
there are little hand ideas
and big hand ideas.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.130
And that's a big hand idea.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.424
And you said BoJack Horseman
is attached?

02:54.507 --> 02:56.342
What? Oh, yeah.
BoJack is attached.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.303
But he's not like "attached" attached.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.013
If you want us
to get somebody better--

03:00.096 --> 03:02.640
Oh, no, no, no.
We love BoJack.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.685
Yeah. We don't wanna do this
without BoJack, just to be clear.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.271
-Well--
-Oh, he's definitely attached.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.690
He signed a contract. I saw it myself.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.236
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.
[gulps]

03:18.489 --> 03:21.826
So if you look to the left, you'll see
a charming little breakfast nook.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.870
-Oh!
-[gasps] Look at that!

03:23.953 --> 03:25.455
But if you want more natural light,

03:25.538 --> 03:28.291
you could knock down that wall
and put in these...

03:28.374 --> 03:31.044
-French doors!
-That is so cool!

03:31.127 --> 03:33.713
-You actually don't have to yell.
-Wait, Diane.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.965
Are we in the same house right now?
I don't see you.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.842
I can hear you.
I think we're close!

03:37.926 --> 03:39.677
You can't see each other
in the program.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.722
So I'm invisible?
Oh, in this scenario, am I a ghost?

03:42.805 --> 03:44.390
Of a Union soldier, perhaps,

03:44.474 --> 03:47.310
who cannot rest until
his final letter is delivered!

03:47.393 --> 03:49.979
And can I be
Anne of Green Gables?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.689
No, you're both still you.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.566
Diane, can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

03:53.650 --> 03:54.901
-Oh, I can step out--
-Sure!

03:54.984 --> 03:58.071
Why don't you meet me
in the guest bathroom? Ow!

03:58.154 --> 03:59.364
-You don't have to.
-Where's--

03:59.447 --> 04:01.824
-Hold on. I think--
-Guys, I can just--

04:01.908 --> 04:03.409
-Here we are.
-Diane?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.245
No. Careful. Okay.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.997
-Do you really love this house?
-Yeah, it's fine.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.374
I didn't love the old house,

04:09.457 --> 04:12.085
but it was your house and I moved in,
and it was great.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.921
But this is an opportunity
to build something together.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.006
Something that'll last
for the rest of our lives.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.842
Anything you want is gonna be good
with me. Just like your old house.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.345
But I don't want this to just be
another one of <i>my</i> houses.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.305
I want this to be <i>our</i> house.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.766
And it will be,
because we'll both be living in it.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.727
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I don't need anything fancy.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.605
All that matters to me
is that I get to live with you.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.691
-In the real world.
-Oh!

04:34.774 --> 04:37.193
No more campaign,
no more ex-wives.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.238
Just Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter,
back to normal.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.949
-For the rest of our lives.
-That sounds great.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.575
-We'll take it.
-One second, though,

04:44.659 --> 04:46.744
-I have to use the bathroom.
-No, no, no, that's not--

04:49.747 --> 04:52.625
<i>You completely humiliated me</i>
<i>in front of Sha Na Na!</i>

04:52.709 --> 04:54.961
[The Horse]
<i>How was I supposed to Sha Na know</i>

04:55.044 --> 04:57.505
<i>they were going to invite me</i>
<i>on the stage to do a guitar solo?</i>

04:57.588 --> 04:59.215
[Sabrina]
<i>You're supposed to be my dad.</i>

04:59.299 --> 05:00.925
<i>You're supposed to be</i>
<i>looking out for me.</i>

05:01.009 --> 05:02.010
[groans]

05:02.093 --> 05:03.803
[Sabrina]
<i>You're the worst dad in the world!</i>

05:03.886 --> 05:06.389
[The Horse] <i>Well, too bad</i>
<i>I'm the only dad you got.</i>

05:06.472 --> 05:07.807
[Sabrina grunts]

05:07.890 --> 05:09.475
-[doorbell chimes]
-[both] <i>Huh?</i>

05:09.559 --> 05:13.313
[The Horse] <i>O.J. Simpson lawyer</i>
<i>and DNA expert Barry Scheck?</i>

05:14.355 --> 05:16.524
-[Scheck] <i>My car broke down.</i>
-[Sabrina] <i>What?</i>

05:16.607 --> 05:18.776
[Scheck] <i>I guess it ran out of... juice.</i>

05:18.860 --> 05:21.029
Hi. Yeah, my mom is a resident.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.572
I've still got a bunch of her stuff.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.449
Don't put me on hold.
Just take a message--

05:24.532 --> 05:26.242
[Sabrina] <i>Wait, wait!</i>
<i>You're a DNA expert?</i>

05:26.326 --> 05:29.245
<i>Could I use DNA</i>
<i>to find my real family?</i>

05:29.329 --> 05:32.040
[Scheck] <i>Well, sometimes,</i>
<i>DNA can be a tricky thing.</i>

05:32.123 --> 05:33.624
<i>Like, for example,</i>

05:33.708 --> 05:37.503
<i>was Simpson DNA found at the scene</i>
<i>of the murder of Nicole Brown?</i>

05:37.587 --> 05:40.923
<i>Sure. Was it O.J. Simpson's DNA?</i>

05:41.007 --> 05:42.216
-<i>Who's to say?</i>
<i>-Oh.</i>

05:42.300 --> 05:45.928
<i>Maybe it was some other Simpson,</i>
<i>like his son, or his father.</i>

05:46.012 --> 05:49.015
<i>There's no way to know.</i>
<i>I wouldn't worry about it.</i>

05:49.098 --> 05:50.600
<i>That's too much, man--</i>

05:56.814 --> 05:57.732
[doorbell chimes]

05:59.233 --> 06:01.694
-Oh.
-Hey, buddy.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.364
-Uh-oh.
-She had a long day... of drinking.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.324
I figured she shouldn't
drive herself home.

06:06.407 --> 06:07.617
-Good thinking.
-Yeah.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.494
I was right too,
because she crashed her car.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.620
What?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.747
I probably should've
said something, but...

06:15.124 --> 06:18.461
You need to get your shit together.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.879
Wha-- Where am I?

06:19.962 --> 06:23.049
Okay, so you know how you're always
giving pep talks to people,

06:23.132 --> 06:25.343
telling them they need
to get their shit together?

06:25.426 --> 06:30.056
Well, this is me giving you
the Princess Carolyn pep talk.

06:30.139 --> 06:34.936
-Why am I tied up in the woods?
-So you can't escape my wise words.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.979
Is that not part of it?
I couldn't remember.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.273
It doesn't matter.
It's all over for me.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.442
When it gets out
I faked BoJack's signature,

06:41.526 --> 06:43.236
the deal's gonna fall apart.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.571
There goes my reputation, my career--

06:45.655 --> 06:49.033
Well, there's more to life
than just your career, isn't there?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.493
-Is there?
-Isn't there?

06:50.576 --> 06:51.786
I have nothing!

06:51.869 --> 06:54.831
Oh! This pep talk is going
in the wrong direction.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.542
Do you know how hard it is
to start a family at my age?

06:57.625 --> 07:00.962
-To find a guy at my age?
-You don't need a guy to start a family.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.965
You're Princess Carolyn.
You can do anything.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.466
No, I can't.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.678
Look, the woods are dark and scary,

07:08.761 --> 07:11.848
but the only way out is through.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.267
I'm sorry.
I got distracted by the woods.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.186
-Um, what were we talking about?
-No, you're right.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.522
The only way out is through.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.900
I gotta talk to BoJack.
I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.193
I'm Princess Carolyn.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.361
That's the spirit!

07:25.445 --> 07:29.115
As my blood type always says,
"B" positive!

07:29.198 --> 07:30.533
-What was that?
-I don't know.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.201
-Oh!
-Oh!

07:32.285 --> 07:34.328
-Hey, Doctor Picarello.
-[groaning]

07:34.412 --> 07:36.038
Doctor Picarello, are you okay?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.165
-[growling]
-Todd?

07:37.248 --> 07:41.169
-[all snarling]
-[drill whirring]

07:43.379 --> 07:46.632
So it turns out Vice Chancellor
Laughing Gassy got rabies

07:46.716 --> 07:48.634
from quarrelling with an old raccoon.

07:48.718 --> 07:52.472
And then he started biting everyone,
and now a bunch of them have rabies.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.183
Who could have predicted
my innocent clown dentist venture

07:55.266 --> 07:59.145
-could turn into something so terrifying?
-I don't see how this concerns me.

07:59.228 --> 08:02.190
Yolanda, the only reason
they're in the woods at all

08:02.273 --> 08:03.316
is because of you.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.527
If people find out the Better
Business Bureau is behind this,

08:06.611 --> 08:08.279
you don't think you'll be getting a buzz

08:08.362 --> 08:11.449
from the Business Branch
of the Board of Better Bureaus?

08:11.532 --> 08:14.368
You're right! We have to do something
before someone gets hurt.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.580
Call me four out of five dentists,
because I agree.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.707
What?

08:22.793 --> 08:25.338
Here we are.
The rest of our lives.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.590
Yeah, wow.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.051
-Do you wanna go to Hawaii?
-What? Right now?

08:30.134 --> 08:32.762
Yeah! When's the last time
we did something impulsive?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.014
Well, you did run for governor
without giving it much--

08:35.097 --> 08:38.726
I just think we could use a vacation.
Things have been so crazy this last year.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.562
Before we start the rest of our lives,
haven't we earned a break?

08:41.646 --> 08:45.191
All right. Let's go to Hawaii! They got
that bridge that's just sitting there.

08:45.274 --> 08:48.236
-We might as well use it.
-All right! Hawaii, here we come!

08:48.319 --> 08:51.906
-All right! Hawaii!
-Hawaii!

08:51.989 --> 08:54.492
-[horns honking]
-[Diane] Oh.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.994
-[Mr. Peanutbutter sighs]
-[gulls squawking]

08:59.830 --> 09:01.040
So, listen.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.876
As you know, one of the differences
between agents and managers--

09:03.960 --> 09:06.837
-Oh, my God. Stop. Please stop.
-I'm producing a new TV show.

09:06.921 --> 09:10.675
It's a phenomenal script which may
or may not involve ghost or newts.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.135
-Does it involve ghost or newts?
-It may!

09:13.219 --> 09:16.055
-You haven't read it, have you?
-Read it? I'm producing it!

09:17.306 --> 09:20.560
-Right.
-It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery--

09:20.643 --> 09:22.979
-Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.
-Right, well--

09:23.062 --> 09:24.564
They're impossible to figure out.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.942
Then all of a sudden, some random detail
makes the hero remember a conversation

09:28.025 --> 09:31.529
that totally re-contextualizes everything,
and then it all magically comes together.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.197
-Sure, but--
-It's such bullshit.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.158
Where's my random detail that's gonna
suddenly make everything make sense?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.243
Because I would love that.

09:37.326 --> 09:41.038
Well, this script is really special,
and everyone wants to play the lead,

09:41.122 --> 09:43.291
from Matthew McConaughey
to Matthew Perry.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.418
-Matthew Perry?
-Yeah. But I was thinking--

09:45.501 --> 09:47.628
Hold on. Matthew Perry...

09:49.338 --> 09:53.301
Hey, BoJack, which one
of these pictures more says,

09:53.384 --> 09:58.347
"This daughter looks like a cool lady
that I wanna have in my life"?

09:58.431 --> 09:59.348
Why do you ask?

09:59.432 --> 10:02.310
I'm writing a letter to my mom
and I want to include a picture.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.353
I'm going to send it
to the adoption agency.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.356
Maybe if they still have her address
on file, they can forward it to her.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.651
Seems like a long shot. How about
a better strategy is, don't do that,

10:10.735 --> 10:13.112
and then you won't be disappointed
when it doesn't work out?

10:13.195 --> 10:15.448
I'm trying everything.
I don't wanna look back at this

10:15.531 --> 10:17.742
and feel like the end
of "Chandler's List," you know?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.785
-You mean <i>Schindler's List</i>.
-Never saw it.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.287
I'm talking about "Chandler's List,"

10:21.370 --> 10:23.664
the sketch from when Matthew Perry
hosted <i>SNL.</i>

10:23.748 --> 10:24.957
-Remind me?
-Okay.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.250
So it's Chandler from <i>Friends,</i>

10:26.334 --> 10:28.502
and it's World War II,
and he's got this list.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.421
And the whole time, he's like,
"I'm Chandler!

10:30.504 --> 10:32.048
Could I <i>have</i> a bigger list?"

10:32.131 --> 10:34.508
But then at the end, the war's over,
and he's like...

10:34.592 --> 10:37.011
-"Could I have had a bigger list?"
-Whoa.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.764
He's haunted because he feels
like he could have done more.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.015
You know, he's like,

10:41.098 --> 10:43.726
"Could I <i>be</i> any more feeling
like I could have done more?"

10:46.354 --> 10:47.480
I have to go.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.650
Look, I'm trying to do you a favor here!
[groans]

10:52.485 --> 10:53.736
[door slams]

10:53.819 --> 10:55.196
[panting]

10:57.031 --> 10:58.324
Oh. [gasps]

10:59.867 --> 11:01.285
Huh.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.627
Huh?

11:10.961 --> 11:14.173
-[snarling]
-[music playing]

11:22.056 --> 11:23.224
Shh!

11:25.476 --> 11:27.770
Yes. Get the magazine.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.773
What a fine addition
to your waiting room.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.609
-Oh, no!
-[drill whirrs]

11:33.692 --> 11:35.528
[music playing at faster tempo]

11:36.821 --> 11:39.281
-[screaming]
-[drill whirring]

11:39.365 --> 11:41.242
[grunting, groaning]

11:45.079 --> 11:46.372
-Oh, God.
-[clown growling]

11:46.455 --> 11:47.832
What are we gonna do, Todd?

11:47.915 --> 11:49.750
-Guys, let's talk this out.
-[drill whirring]

11:49.834 --> 11:51.043
[horn honking]

11:58.092 --> 12:00.928
Run. Ouchie! Ouchie!

12:01.011 --> 12:04.265
[both panting]

12:04.348 --> 12:06.559
-Oh, man.
-I've never run that fast in my life.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.477
-Me neither.
-I gotta get in better shape.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.897
I keep saying I'm gonna run more,
but it's just so hard to stay motivated.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.315
Hmm.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.526
Don't "hmm." I'm talking to you.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.199
-[horns honking]
-[tires screeching]

12:22.283 --> 12:25.661
-Can you not start and stop so much?
-I can't control the traffic, darling.

12:25.744 --> 12:29.331
When the car in front of me starts,
I start. And when it stops, I stop.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.293
Maybe you don't have to start
every time the car in front of you starts,

12:32.376 --> 12:34.253
because you know it's gonna
stop again anyway.

12:34.336 --> 12:37.006
-You could leave a little space.
-Okay.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.009
-[engine rumbles]
-And another car just cut in front of me

12:40.092 --> 12:42.136
because I left a little space.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.221
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.015
Okay. I'm gonna get some gas.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.565
All right. I got the lowdown.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.151
First of all, very important,
I got you this flattened penny.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.195
I will cherish it always.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.406
-I'm sorry for being annoying before.
-Don't worry about it.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.532
Here's the deal.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.951
With this traffic,
we can stay on our current trajectory

13:06.035 --> 13:09.038
and get to Hawaii just in time
to spend two luxurious hours

13:09.121 --> 13:11.582
at the Honolulu Stilton,
and then turn around and come back,

13:11.665 --> 13:14.251
or we can hang out here
at the Thrifty Lodge

13:14.335 --> 13:17.004
at this charming halfway to Hawaii
rest area and gas park.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.967
Excuse me,
we would like your finest room, please.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.763
-All our rooms are the same.
-What kind of cuisine is on premises?

13:25.846 --> 13:28.182
There's a deli at the gas station
across the street.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.809
-And what are your spa hours?
-There's no spa.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.979
Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala,
could I use your grand ballroom for that,

13:34.063 --> 13:35.689
or is that booked months in advance?

13:35.773 --> 13:37.733
I could settle for a demi-ballroom
in a pinch,

13:37.816 --> 13:40.152
but attire will be formal,
I don't wanna upstage the venue.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.488
We have zero ballrooms
in this Thrifty Lodge.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.281
I see. This will do nicely.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.661
Didn't you tell me once
you always wanted a ballroom?

13:48.744 --> 13:51.997
Actually, no. [chuckles]
What I wanted was a Belle-room.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.333
What is that? Like a room full of bells?

13:54.416 --> 13:57.545
It's a room full of big books,
with big windows and a ladder,

13:57.628 --> 13:59.380
like Belle got in <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

13:59.463 --> 14:02.383
-And it's called a Belle-room?
-It's called a library.

14:02.466 --> 14:05.261
But I called it a Belle-room
because it was magical.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.763
And since it was a name I made up
for a room that wasn't real,

14:07.846 --> 14:09.390
that meant that it was just mine.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.100
That's adora-Belle.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.310
-[woman] Hey, Seaborn! Seaborn!
-What's that?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.396
You're Seaborn's Seahorse Milk, right?

14:15.479 --> 14:16.730
Ha! That's right.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.566
Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie?

14:18.649 --> 14:20.609
That's like a shellfish version
of a selfie.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.195
-Hmm?
-Go, take a picture.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.363
It'll make their day.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.323
-You sure? You don't mind?
-I'll be in the room.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.200
Don't stay out
with your new friends too late.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.120
Hey, guys. I'm coming down.
What other of my things do you like?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.038
[man] Wow, yeah!

14:35.833 --> 14:37.418
Okay, so...

14:49.847 --> 14:51.473
[snoring]

14:56.729 --> 14:58.480
Oh.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.815
Hey.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.116
[Jose] So the supplier said,
"I really oughta give Iowa a try."

15:09.199 --> 15:12.202
But I said, "Buddy, Kansas City's
about as far as I can go."

15:12.286 --> 15:14.580
Long story short,
we're meeting in St. Louis.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.707
-[pounding on door]
-Huh?

15:16.790 --> 15:18.167
-Hey!
-I need to talk to Hollyhock!

15:18.250 --> 15:20.002
-She's not here.
-You have to let me see her.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.338
Please, I flew all the way here
and it's Wichita,

15:22.421 --> 15:25.341
so it's not like
I got other shit to do in Wichita.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.009
No one told you to come here.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.969
You're the one
who likes foreign movies, right?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.388
That part in <i>Amelie,</i>
where she listens to the guy's story?

15:31.472 --> 15:33.599
This is that part.
And I'm the guy with the story.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.684
And I need you to be Amelie right now.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.355
I don't like foreign movies.
I like foreign <i>films.</i>

15:39.438 --> 15:40.773
Okay, you're impossible.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.858
The rest of you, please,
just listen for a second.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.819
I know you hate me.
But for Hollyhock, please, listen.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.405
[clears throat]

15:48.489 --> 15:50.950
Whole time she's staying with me,
it doesn't make sense, right?

15:51.033 --> 15:52.701
If I'm her father,
where is her mother?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.787
Well, that's an extremely
heteronormative way

15:54.870 --> 15:56.830
-of looking at things.
-No, I'm saying, medically,

15:56.914 --> 15:59.792
where is the woman I had sex with
that made her be born?

15:59.875 --> 16:02.252
Right? That's why Hollyhock
came to L.A. in the first place.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.504
Okay...

16:03.587 --> 16:06.298
But then I thought,
"What if I'm not her father?"

16:06.382 --> 16:08.092
You're not her father.
<i>We </i>are her fathers.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.760
You're her fathers. Yeah. I know, I know.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.971
Eight of you, each have
your own cute thing, I get it.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.264
My point is, Hollyhock and I
have the same DNA,

16:14.348 --> 16:16.517
but that doesn't mean I'm her father.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.978
You're not.
Because being a father isn't just--

16:19.061 --> 16:21.271
God, I feel like you are
willfully misunderstanding me.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.608
What I am saying is,
I'm not even her father biologically.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.986
-Excuse me?
-My father is her father.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.320
-What?
-Huh?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.656
[BoJack] <i>I went to every hospital</i>
<i>and clerk house in L.A.</i>

16:30.739 --> 16:33.867
<i>I waited in lines, filled out forms,</i>
<i>talked to anyone who would talk to me.</i>

16:33.951 --> 16:36.537
<i>I wouldn't rest until I knew</i>
<i>I'd done everything I could.</i>

16:36.620 --> 16:38.831
<i>But there was no record</i>
<i>of a little horse girl</i>

16:38.914 --> 16:40.416
<i>born on Hollyhock's birthday...</i>

16:40.499 --> 16:41.583
Okay, so?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.336
...in L.A., because Hollyhock
wasn't born in L.A.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.171
She was born in San Francisco.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.091
<i>I got a little bug in my brain</i>
<i>that my father knocked up the help.</i>

16:49.174 --> 16:52.052
<i>So I went up there, and I did</i>
<i>the whole thing again, and I found it.</i>

16:52.136 --> 16:53.971
<i>The birth certificate</i>
<i>with her mother's name,</i>

16:54.054 --> 16:56.849
<i>clear as day, Henrietta Platchkey.</i>

16:56.932 --> 16:58.642
-That's--
-But where is she now, right?

16:58.726 --> 17:00.686
<i>Looked her up on Facebook.</i>
<i>I know what you think:</i>

17:00.769 --> 17:02.646
<i>"BoJack Horseman</i>
<i>has a Facebook account?"</i>

17:02.730 --> 17:05.190
<i>Obviously, I didn't,</i>
<i>because the Internet is for nerds.</i>

17:05.274 --> 17:08.736
<i>But I know it's a good way to find people,</i>
<i>so I set up an account, and I found her.</i>

17:08.819 --> 17:10.904
<i>She lives in Minneapolis.</i>
<i>She's a nurse.</i>

17:10.988 --> 17:12.698
<i>Her phone number</i>
<i>was on her Facebook page.</i>

17:12.781 --> 17:15.034
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.869
-You did all that?
-She has to know.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.788
You don't have to tell her I was here.
I'll stay out of her life forever.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.416
You can tell her I'm an asshole.
Say you found this on your own.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.586
I don't care, but you have
to tell her. Please.

-All right, BoJack. We'll tell her.
-Yeah?

17:42.603 --> 17:45.230
Yeah. But you need to leave.
Right now.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.399
[sighs] Okay.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.156
Welcome to the best
workout routine in L.A.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.158
Nothing motivates like fear.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.286
So remember, once you're in there,
don't stop running.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.830
If the clown dentists catch you,
they will bite you,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.665
and they have very healthy teeth.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.001
[chuckles] Okay, but not really, right?

18:06.085 --> 18:10.964
Nope, really. They will actually bite you,
and they do actually have rabies.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.092
Wow, guess I'm gonna
really have to run.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.135
No more excuses. This is great.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.555
Exactly! And don't forget...
have fun in there!

18:18.639 --> 18:20.182
-[woman] Whoo-hoo!
-[man] Let's do this.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.351
-[man 2] Let's go.
-[all screaming]

18:25.938 --> 18:28.148
Well, you did it.
You made a better business.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.483
<i>We </i>did it.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.902
Between your no-nonsense approach

18:31.985 --> 18:34.446
and my the-regular-amount-of-nonsense
approach,

18:34.530 --> 18:36.115
we make a pretty good team.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.242
Yes. I'm going back to my job.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.285
But if anything happens here
and you need me,

18:40.369 --> 18:42.830
or if you just wanna hang out again,

18:42.913 --> 18:45.082
grab a drink,
you should call me sometime.

18:45.165 --> 18:49.336
Oh, um, I should tell you,
I'm actually asexual.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.965
Yeah, I know. So am I.
That's why I'm asking you out.

18:53.048 --> 18:56.552
-Oh! Uh, okay.
-Okay. Goodbye.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.806
Huh.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.606
[doorbell chimes, whinnies]

19:11.900 --> 19:14.486
-I have to talk to you.
-Make yourself at home.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.405
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.448
I promised you'd do this show.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.451
I don't know why. I just...
I needed something--

19:21.535 --> 19:22.828
-I'll do it.
-What?

19:22.911 --> 19:26.039
You want me to do it, I'll do it.
God knows you've done enough for me.

19:26.123 --> 19:29.501
-[groans]
-What's wrong? I said I'd do it.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.130
It's just really hard to need people.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.424
Yeah, but...

19:35.507 --> 19:37.759
Yeah. Thank you.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.470
Eh, it'll be good for me
to get out of the house anyway.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.638
You want a drink?

19:41.722 --> 19:43.974
-Water.
-Water? "Water" you pregnant?

19:44.057 --> 19:46.018
[chuckles] Very much not so.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.812
-I heard you got a new boyfriend.
-We broke up.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.148
Oh. Sounds like an asshole.

19:51.231 --> 19:55.152
He was actually the first guy I ever dated
who wasn't an asshole.

19:55.235 --> 19:59.031
-Well, onwards and upwards.
-I heard you had a kid living with you?

19:59.114 --> 20:01.950
No. She's got these adopted dads.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.620
They're total dicks,
but they take care of her.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.830
-She'll have a good life.
-Oh.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.583
-You ever think of adopting?
-[sighs]

20:09.666 --> 20:12.878
-More and more lately.
-You should. You'd be a good mom.

20:12.961 --> 20:16.048
-The world needs good moms.
-I'll take that under advisement.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.176
Well, I guess I'll see you on set.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.094
I'm looking forward to it.

20:27.851 --> 20:31.146
Now, back to normal.
Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.317
-Here we are. The rest of our lives.
-I wanna show you something.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.446
I had the contractor put this together
while we were gone. Close your eyes.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.157
-[Diane] Okay...
-All right. Open them.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.202
-Oh, my God! It's--
-Pretty cool, huh?

20:45.285 --> 20:48.664
-Why would you do this?
-It's what you always wanted, right?

20:48.747 --> 20:51.166
It's too much. I didn't want it like this.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.252
-Like what?
-I don't know. I'm sorry.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.963
This is great. I'm sorry.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.839
Why would you think I would like this?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.133
Because you told me
this is what you always dreamed of?

21:00.217 --> 21:02.386
I don't like big gestures like this!

21:02.469 --> 21:04.846
-How many times have I--?
-Yeah, but this is--

21:04.930 --> 21:07.975
This was a fantasy,
something that belonged to me.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.351
Why couldn't you have asked me--

21:09.434 --> 21:12.688
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever try
to surprise you, or do nice things.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.940
Do you know how much it cost
to get 5,000 fake books?

21:15.023 --> 21:18.360
-So I'm the bitch? Is that what you--
-I'm sorry that I wanted to make our home

21:18.443 --> 21:20.445
feel like a place
that you would want to live

21:20.529 --> 21:22.072
that could be yours as well as mine!

21:22.155 --> 21:24.032
Why is that so important to you?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.243
Because otherwise,
it feels like you're a guest.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.371
And unlike the talking candlestick
in the aforementioned Disney film,

21:29.454 --> 21:31.039
I don't want you to be that.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.291
It makes me feel shitty.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.834
Like you're just visiting here,

21:33.917 --> 21:35.919
until the next thing
and you're gonna leave me

21:36.003 --> 21:37.879
when you get bored
or you find something better.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.756
Like Katrina did. Like Jessica did.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.384
You can't use your ex-wives against me.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.219
I'm just telling you how I feel.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.555
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.099
This is not how I thought
this would go at all.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.434
[sighs]

21:50.517 --> 21:53.270
Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.
Back to normal, right?

21:53.353 --> 21:55.397
[chuckles]

21:55.480 --> 21:59.192
You know, sometimes I feel like
our marriage is like a magic eye poster.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.111
-I love those things.
-I know.

22:01.194 --> 22:05.032
And it's messy. And at first glance,
it doesn't seem to make any sense.

22:05.115 --> 22:07.701
And it's hard to figure out.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.453
But sometimes,

22:09.536 --> 22:12.539
if you squint at it just right,
everything lines up,

22:12.622 --> 22:17.627
and it's the most perfect...
beautiful, amazing thing.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.546
Yeah. I know what you mean.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.506
But...

22:21.590 --> 22:23.717
[voice breaks] I'm so tired of squinting.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.678
[crying]

22:26.762 --> 22:28.138
Oh...

22:40.067 --> 22:41.568
What?

22:41.651 --> 22:44.196
-Oh, Christ.
-[ringtone chiming]

22:47.491 --> 22:48.700
-Hollyhock.
-Hi.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.202
<i>-How are you?</i>
-Listen...

22:50.285 --> 22:52.496
I wanted to thank you
for finding my mom.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.206
-They told you?
-Not exactly.

22:54.289 --> 22:57.000
They have this secret dad language
they think I don't understand,

22:57.084 --> 22:59.211
but it's super obvious
what they're saying.

22:59.294 --> 23:02.464
[chuckles] You're too smart
for your own good.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.301
So, yeah, I've been talking
to Henrietta on the phone

23:06.384 --> 23:08.261
and she seems really nice.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.387
Really? Wow!

23:09.471 --> 23:12.766
I'm gonna visit her in Minneapolis.
I'm at the airport right now.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.351
Right now? That's incredible.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.062
No, what's incredible
is this place at the airport

23:17.145 --> 23:19.481
charged me ten dollars
for a cup of fruit.

23:19.564 --> 23:20.941
<i>-What?</i>
-And get this.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.068
<i>It's like 90 percent honeydew.</i>

23:23.151 --> 23:24.694
Are you kidding me? Why?

23:24.778 --> 23:29.199
What on-the-go jet-setter's demanding
more honeydew in his or her fruit cup?

23:29.282 --> 23:31.201
Nobody ever wants honeydew,
it's always there.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.703
It is literally the worst part
of everything it's in.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.705
It's like the Jared Leto of fruits.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.082
Thank you. Exactly.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.083
Mmm.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.627
Well...

23:40.710 --> 23:43.880
Anyway,
they're about to start boarding, so...

23:43.964 --> 23:46.758
Hollyhock, I'm sorry
I didn't take better care of you.

23:46.842 --> 23:50.011
I shouldn't have moved in with you.
It was maybe too much too fast.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.264
-Yeah.
<i>-But it wasn't all bad.</i>

23:52.347 --> 23:55.225
I mean, yeah,
I got secretly drugged for months on end

23:55.308 --> 23:58.562
to the point I was living a nightmare
in which I couldn't recognize my own body

23:58.645 --> 24:00.897
or understand what was happening
to my brain, but,

24:00.981 --> 24:03.733
other than that,
it was a pretty chill experience.

24:03.817 --> 24:04.943
I should have protected you.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.028
I really wanted to be
a good dad to you, Hollyhock.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.614
Well, turns out you're not my dad at all.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.616
Yeah. Good thing, I guess.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.910
Yeah. Good thing.

24:15.328 --> 24:19.708
So, uh, Minneapolis, huh?
Did you rent a car or a cab?

24:19.791 --> 24:22.377
BoJack, it's all taken care of.
I gotta go.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.962
Is there anything, uh, I can do?

24:24.045 --> 24:26.464
I can upgrade your seats, or...
or send you better fruit.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.926
BoJack, look,
I never needed you to be a dad.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.261
I'm going to be fine.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.763
<i>I told you from the beginning,</i>
<i>I have eight dads.</i>

24:33.847 --> 24:37.100
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

24:37.184 --> 24:41.021
But... I've never had a brother.
