WEBVTT

00:02.963 --> 00:04.999
(violin music playing)

00:06.433 --> 00:08.469
(indistinct chatter)

00:08.502 --> 00:10.638
DENNIS:
Frank, would you like
another buttered nipple?

00:11.438 --> 00:14.542
No. The cream
is making me gassy.

00:14.575 --> 00:17.077
-Yeah, well, you have had
four of them.
-Yeah.

00:17.111 --> 00:19.013
-(both laugh)
-You know, we could order you

00:19.046 --> 00:20.815
something that's a little bit
easier on the pipes.

00:20.848 --> 00:22.416
-DENNIS: Yeah.
-You know,
I know what you're doing.

00:22.449 --> 00:23.951
This is your annual

00:23.984 --> 00:26.520
"take me out and see
if you can talk me into

00:26.554 --> 00:27.855
giving you more of my money."

00:27.888 --> 00:29.790
-Oh, stop.
-Uh-- Is he talking to us?

00:29.824 --> 00:31.792
-Give me money. (laughs)
-We would never. (laughs)

00:31.826 --> 00:33.828
-(grunts)
-DEE: And we just want you
to have a fun night.

00:33.861 --> 00:34.829
DENNIS:
Yeah.

00:34.862 --> 00:35.996
Oh. (laughs)

00:36.030 --> 00:37.865
(groans)

00:37.898 --> 00:40.000
-Yeah, get that.
-What you working on there, bud?

00:40.034 --> 00:41.936
I brought my own can
of anchovies

00:41.969 --> 00:44.405
because the fish in this place
is not salty enough.

00:44.438 --> 00:46.540
-Mm, that's...
-I agree.

00:46.574 --> 00:47.675
-Got no taste.
-DENNIS and DEE: Yeah.

00:47.708 --> 00:49.410
Yeah, no, I-I hear you.

00:49.443 --> 00:51.011
It's, uh, it's not salty enough.

00:51.045 --> 00:53.647
I want to point something out
here to you, Frank.

00:53.681 --> 00:55.950
I think we do a pretty good job

00:55.983 --> 00:57.418
of pretending like
you're not an animal.

00:57.451 --> 00:58.686
(laughs)

00:58.719 --> 00:59.620
Is that thing loaded,
by the way?

00:59.653 --> 01:00.921
Nah, it's not loaded.

01:00.955 --> 01:03.724
-(Dee sighs)
-And get off my back,

01:03.757 --> 01:04.758
huh?

01:04.792 --> 01:06.460
-Hey. Absolutely.
-Yup.

01:06.494 --> 01:07.661
You got it. (laughs)

01:07.695 --> 01:08.863
Got no intention to be

01:08.896 --> 01:10.598
-riding on your back, pal.
-No.

01:10.631 --> 01:11.966
DENNIS:
We like you
just the way you are.

01:11.999 --> 01:14.001
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-And I think that, you know,

01:14.034 --> 01:17.004
maybe, just possibly, that
entitles us to a little taste

01:17.037 --> 01:18.806
-of your fortune after you die?
-Oh.

01:18.839 --> 01:19.874
-You know what I mean? I-I...
-Oh.

01:19.907 --> 01:21.475
I want to tell you something,

01:21.509 --> 01:23.944
I am not intending on dying
anytime soon,

01:23.978 --> 01:25.913
so don't waste your breath.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.782
-(grunts)
-(sighs)
-You know what? Screw this.

01:28.816 --> 01:30.484
-Okay.
-I... Dee, I told you
this was a mistake.

01:30.518 --> 01:31.786
-No, I know, I know.
-I-- You know what? I'm out

01:31.819 --> 01:32.987
-of here.
-Couple of vultures

01:33.020 --> 01:34.522
picking at my carcass.

01:34.555 --> 01:35.890
-Uh-huh.
-You know, I am in the prime

01:35.923 --> 01:37.391
-of my life.
-Yeah.

01:37.424 --> 01:39.460
I mean, if you think
that you can...

01:39.493 --> 01:41.796
-(gunshot)
-(Dennis and Dee scream)

01:41.829 --> 01:43.297
-DENNIS: You shot us!
-(patrons murmuring)

01:43.330 --> 01:44.465
You shot us!
I got shot in the face!

01:44.498 --> 01:45.933
You said there were no bullets!

01:45.966 --> 01:48.836
Okay, so it was loaded.
My mistake.

01:48.869 --> 01:50.471
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

01:50.504 --> 01:51.906
I just nicked you.

01:51.939 --> 01:54.375
It's not like anybody's
in any real danger.

01:55.342 --> 01:57.378
♪ ♪

02:19.567 --> 02:21.368
I'm saying, don't shoot
the whole balloon down, right?

02:21.402 --> 02:22.803
-Like, you-you pull it down...
-Frank shot us.

02:22.837 --> 02:24.772
He shot us in the face.
We barely survived.

02:24.805 --> 02:26.006
Awesome.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.741
-Wha...
-Uh, no, not awesome.

02:27.775 --> 02:30.044
Oh, sorry.
You came in all excited.

02:30.077 --> 02:31.679
I thought you were bragging.

02:31.712 --> 02:33.414
I was picking up
on an excited energy, for sure.

02:33.447 --> 02:34.915
Getting shot in the face
and surviving is pretty cool.

02:34.949 --> 02:35.916
Yeah.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.618
This is insane.

02:37.651 --> 02:38.986
Listen, we got to get his gun
away from him, okay?

02:39.019 --> 02:40.521
I-I don't even care
about the money anymore.

02:40.554 --> 02:41.755
Oh, yeah, no, no, neither do I.

02:41.789 --> 02:42.790
I don't give a shit
about the money.

02:42.823 --> 02:44.592
I mean, the man is a maniac,

02:44.625 --> 02:45.993
and he's gonna wind up shooting
everyone in this bar.

02:46.026 --> 02:47.528
Oh, yeah. I do care
about the money, though.

02:47.561 --> 02:49.663
-Yeah, no, so do I. Absolutely.
-Yeah.

02:49.697 --> 02:50.998
-It's the only thing I care
about. Are you kidding me?
-Yeah. Yeah.

02:51.031 --> 02:52.733
Come on. You know
what I'm worried about?

02:52.766 --> 02:54.001
I'm worried he's gonna
kill himself with that gun

02:54.034 --> 02:55.035
before he gets
old and senile enough

02:55.069 --> 02:56.637
to rewrite us into the will.

02:56.670 --> 02:58.005
That's it. That's it.
We need him to live

02:58.038 --> 02:59.640
long enough
so he can become fully demented.

02:59.673 --> 03:00.641
-Mm-hmm.
-CHARLIE: I know, but, guys,

03:00.674 --> 03:01.809
I'm picking up, like,

03:01.842 --> 03:03.377
a super stressed-out vibe
from you,

03:03.410 --> 03:05.646
and it's really important
to remember, like,

03:05.679 --> 03:08.082
you know,
money isn't everything.

03:08.115 --> 03:10.084
Yeah, of course
you don't care, Charlie,

03:10.117 --> 03:12.019
because your dad didn't have
anything to pass down to you.

03:12.052 --> 03:14.989
No, that's true,
but my mom does. Yeah.

03:15.022 --> 03:17.925
On my mom's family side, I got a
huge inheritance coming my way.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.361
Wait, what?

03:20.394 --> 03:22.363
H-How did I not know this?
You're gonna be rich?

03:22.396 --> 03:24.465
Yeah. Totally. Yeah.

03:24.498 --> 03:27.768
Well, uh,
rich in history and legacy

03:27.802 --> 03:29.937
and, uh... (clear throat)
...teeth, of course.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.739
Teeth?

03:31.772 --> 03:34.375
Yeah. It's a pretty sweet deal,
actually, you know.

03:34.408 --> 03:36.076
Everyone on my mom's side
of the family,

03:36.110 --> 03:38.813
going back to the Niña
and the-the Pinta

03:38.846 --> 03:40.614
and the, uh, Santa Margherita,

03:40.648 --> 03:43.017
um, they've all been putting
their teeth into a jar

03:43.050 --> 03:44.485
-when they die.
-Mm-hmm.

03:44.518 --> 03:46.620
And, uh, when I turn 40,

03:46.654 --> 03:47.988
that sweet little piece

03:48.022 --> 03:49.590
of history's coming my way.

03:49.623 --> 03:50.858
Just stop. Okay, Dee,

03:50.891 --> 03:51.926
we need to get that gun
away from Frank.

03:51.959 --> 03:53.627
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

03:53.661 --> 03:55.362
You don't do something
like that.

03:55.396 --> 03:57.331
You know, because, like,
Frank's gun is a big piece

03:57.364 --> 03:58.666
of who he is, right?

03:58.699 --> 04:00.334
That's his legacy.
That's his history.

04:00.367 --> 04:02.770
That's like, that's like
my jar of teeth, right?

04:02.803 --> 04:04.772
I don't want that taken away
from me when I get old.

04:04.805 --> 04:06.373
What are you talking about?

04:06.407 --> 04:09.343
Charlie, I got some
bad news for you, bud.

04:09.376 --> 04:10.377
What?

04:10.411 --> 04:12.847
You turned 40 a long time ago.

04:15.416 --> 04:17.351
Yo. Hey, Ma, how you doing?

04:17.384 --> 04:19.386
-Hi, Mom.
-Oh, hi, boys.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.055
-What brings you by?
-Yeah, uh,

04:21.088 --> 04:23.591
hey, I want to show Mac
that jar of family teeth we got.

04:23.624 --> 04:24.792
Oh.

04:24.825 --> 04:26.360
-Y-You-you do?
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

04:26.393 --> 04:27.895
Hey, Ma, did you realize
I was over 40?

04:27.928 --> 04:29.897
(gasps) You are?

04:29.930 --> 04:31.999
Yeah, turns out. Yeah, I figured
you probably forgot, too,

04:32.032 --> 04:33.534
or something, but, um, yeah,

04:33.567 --> 04:34.802
can I get that jar of teeth
now, please?

04:34.835 --> 04:36.871
Oh, okay, I-I'll go
look for them.

04:36.904 --> 04:39.039
Okay, yeah, good.
Go-go get my teeth, please.

04:39.073 --> 04:40.374
Cool. Hey, Mom,

04:40.407 --> 04:41.509
since we're here, um,

04:41.542 --> 04:42.610
do we have any kind of, like,

04:42.643 --> 04:43.944
family heirlooms or anything?

04:43.978 --> 04:45.746
No.

04:45.779 --> 04:47.781
(sighs) Like, anything of value

04:47.815 --> 04:49.650
that our family owned
at some point?

04:49.683 --> 04:51.485
No.

04:51.519 --> 04:54.054
Hm. Okay, what if it's just,
like, sentimental?

04:54.088 --> 04:55.723
Just, like,
proof that we existed?

04:55.756 --> 04:57.758
Nope.

04:57.792 --> 04:59.026
Wait, what about those letters?

04:59.059 --> 05:00.528
Weren't there
some kind of letters

05:00.561 --> 05:01.462
that my grandfather
wrote to my dad

05:01.495 --> 05:02.429
during World War II?

05:03.430 --> 05:04.899
Yeah.

05:04.932 --> 05:06.600
Those letters exist?
Well, well, who's got them?

05:06.634 --> 05:08.536
Donald.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.938
-Donald? Donald who?
-Oh...

05:10.971 --> 05:13.040
Duck.

05:13.073 --> 05:15.042
(laughs) Yeah.

05:15.075 --> 05:17.044
Donald... Donald Duck?
What's she talking about?

05:17.077 --> 05:19.013
Yeah, my mom's making a joke.
She's-she's really funny.

05:19.046 --> 05:20.881
She's got a great sense
of humor. Right, Mom?

05:20.915 --> 05:22.883
Yeah.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.652
Yeah. She's talking
about my Uncle Donald.

05:24.685 --> 05:26.620
Huh. I didn't even know
you had an uncle Donald.

05:26.654 --> 05:28.022
Yeah, yeah,
that's my dad's brother.

05:28.055 --> 05:29.857
Donald McDonald?

05:29.890 --> 05:30.925
Yeah.

05:30.958 --> 05:32.660
Ronald McDonald.

05:32.693 --> 05:35.029
Donald McDonald. Wow.

05:35.062 --> 05:37.331
Your dad really scored with
the name Luther, I guess, huh?

05:37.364 --> 05:38.399
(Bonnie screams)

05:38.432 --> 05:40.634
Mom? What happened?

05:40.668 --> 05:42.336
-MAC: Oh, shit.
-(muffled whimper)

05:42.369 --> 05:43.737
Did she try to pull out
her own teeth?

05:43.771 --> 05:44.939
Did you just try to pull out
your own teeth?

05:44.972 --> 05:47.007
-Mm-mm.
-She clearly did.

05:47.041 --> 05:48.742
-I can see the pliers.
-We can see the pliers, Mom.

05:49.810 --> 05:51.779
-Ah! Ugh!
-Oh!

05:51.812 --> 05:54.381
-I'm so sorry.
-CHARLIE: Mom.

05:54.415 --> 05:56.750
Oh, my God. Why did you do that?

05:56.784 --> 05:59.320
I didn't have the heart
to-to tell you,

05:59.353 --> 06:02.389
I gave away the jar. (crying)

06:02.423 --> 06:04.625
You gave away the jar of teeth?
To who?

06:04.658 --> 06:05.926
Your sisters.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.728
To my sisters?

06:07.761 --> 06:10.030
Those ungrateful bitches.
What the hell, Mom?

06:10.064 --> 06:11.732
They don't even live
in Philly anymore.

06:11.765 --> 06:12.933
They moved all the way
up to northern New Jersey.

06:12.967 --> 06:14.802
They're terrible to you.

06:14.835 --> 06:16.403
I'm the one who stayed. I'm
the one who takes care of you.

06:16.437 --> 06:17.638
How could you do that?

06:17.671 --> 06:19.006
(screaming)

06:19.039 --> 06:21.342
-Now she's screaming.
-This is crazy.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.943
Now she's screaming.
Now she's screaming.

06:22.977 --> 06:24.612
-Well, you yelled at her.
-Now Mom's screaming.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.013
Now Mom's screaming.

06:26.046 --> 06:28.482
Ah, I can't believe
you did this.

06:28.516 --> 06:30.518
-Why are you yelling at her?
I don't know...
-She gave it away to my sisters.

06:30.551 --> 06:31.919
They're the worst people
on the planet.

06:31.952 --> 06:32.920
I didn't even remember
that you had sisters.

06:32.953 --> 06:34.622
All right. Okay, okay.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.390
Look, we're just gonna have
to go and get them.

06:36.423 --> 06:37.925
I think she's having
a stroke, dude.

06:37.958 --> 06:39.860
We're just gonna have
to get in the car right now

06:39.894 --> 06:41.028
-and go get them. Come on, man.
-We should go to the hospital.

06:41.061 --> 06:42.730
Let's get in the car. Let's go.

06:42.763 --> 06:44.465
Mrs. Mac, we're taking your car.
Mom, just calm down.

06:44.498 --> 06:46.467
It's okay, okay? I'm not mad
at you. It's fine, okay?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.068
-I love you.
-Breathe through your,
breathe through your nose.

06:48.102 --> 06:49.670
-I love you, too.
I love you, too.
-This is fucking insane.

06:49.703 --> 06:51.505
I made a mistake.

06:51.539 --> 06:53.674
You did make a mistake.
You did make this... All right.

06:53.707 --> 06:55.342
Christ, let's get her
cleaned up. All right.

06:55.376 --> 06:56.343
I didn't mean to upset you.

06:56.377 --> 06:58.312
(Frank grunting)

06:59.547 --> 07:01.081
Frank, um,

07:01.115 --> 07:02.750
could you stop scratching
yourself with the gun, please?

07:02.783 --> 07:04.452
-I'm itchy, I'm itchy.
-I-I bet.

07:04.485 --> 07:05.753
Probably from rolling around
in the grass

07:05.786 --> 07:06.987
outside of your apartment.

07:07.021 --> 07:08.589
No, I was rolling around
in the grass

07:08.622 --> 07:09.723
because I was itchy.

07:09.757 --> 07:10.991
The itch came first.

07:11.025 --> 07:12.660
Okay, well, why don't you
hand me the gun,

07:12.693 --> 07:13.727
-and I'll scratch you
with my fingers.
-Yeah.

07:13.761 --> 07:15.396
I'm not gonna hand you my gun,

07:15.429 --> 07:16.597
but I'll let you scratch.
You want to scratch me?

07:16.630 --> 07:19.066
-Go on. (grunts) Yeah.
-Okay.

07:19.099 --> 07:20.768
-All right.
-Scratch me. See.

07:20.801 --> 07:22.870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do it down by the neck.

07:22.903 --> 07:24.672
-Frank, I...
-FRANK: The back of the neck.
The back of the neck.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.606
-Okay, but I just don't want
to get shot again, is all.

07:25.639 --> 07:27.007
The gun's not loaded.

07:27.041 --> 07:28.609
Yeah, that's what you said
last time, Frank.

07:28.642 --> 07:30.511
FRANK:
(grunts) I got to take a piss.

07:30.544 --> 07:31.846
-Pull over.
-DENNIS: All right.

07:36.417 --> 07:38.352
(grunting)

07:38.385 --> 07:39.453
Okay.

07:39.487 --> 07:40.988
-(grunting)
-Goddamn it.

07:41.021 --> 07:42.590
This is not working.

07:42.623 --> 07:44.024
Should we just attack him
and take it?

07:44.058 --> 07:45.993
What? No.

07:46.026 --> 07:47.761
He'd mow us down like Scarface.
We can't come at him like that.

07:47.795 --> 07:49.864
-We'll spook him.
-Yeah.

07:49.897 --> 07:51.398
You know what?
He needs to be lulled

07:51.432 --> 07:52.933
into a false sense of security.

07:52.967 --> 07:54.768
You don't tell a dog
you're taking him to a vet

07:54.802 --> 07:55.870
to put him down.

07:55.903 --> 07:57.438
Right.

07:58.205 --> 08:01.075
You give
that dog
the best day of his life,

08:01.108 --> 08:03.777
and then you turn out the lights
when he least suspects it.

08:03.811 --> 08:05.946
-(laughs)
-Okay.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.548
Okay. Oh...

08:07.581 --> 08:09.617
Ooh.

08:09.650 --> 08:11.986
Ooh, that was a long wait.

08:12.019 --> 08:13.954
-Woo.
-Wow.

08:19.794 --> 08:21.328
♪ Just can't wait... ♪

08:21.362 --> 08:22.863
Why is your mom driving
my mom's car?

08:22.897 --> 08:24.465
I don't know. Dude, they got
some weird arrangement

08:24.498 --> 08:26.734
worked out so your mom
can focus on smoking.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.636
Speaking of, I'm getting
choked to death back here.

08:28.669 --> 08:30.771
Mrs. Mac, do you mind, like,
cracking a window or something?

08:30.805 --> 08:32.506
No.

08:32.540 --> 08:34.375
Why not? I mean, it's ridiculous
to just sit in the smoke.

08:34.408 --> 08:37.912
'Cause it's too drafty.
It's unhealthy.

08:37.945 --> 08:39.613
-Right.
-Unheal-- What?

08:39.647 --> 08:41.382
Sorry, my mom's on
a new health kick. (laughs)

08:41.415 --> 08:43.350
Hey, Mom, it's working.
You look great.

08:43.384 --> 08:44.852
Shut up.

08:44.885 --> 08:46.654
CHARLIE:
Can we, like speed up
or something?

08:46.687 --> 08:48.722
Another car just passed us.
Mom, that's, like, the 50th car.

08:48.756 --> 08:50.024
Why are you going so slow?

08:50.057 --> 08:51.859
Well, highways are scary.

08:51.892 --> 08:53.594
You're going 35.

08:53.627 --> 08:54.628
-I can see you're going 35.
-But-- And everybody's

08:54.662 --> 08:55.763
just in such a hurry.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.465
No, it's just the normal--

08:57.498 --> 08:59.033
It's the speed that people go
on the highway.

08:59.066 --> 09:00.601
Okay, maybe I should drive.
Mom, can I drive your car?

09:00.634 --> 09:01.936
-Can Mac drive?
-No.

09:01.969 --> 09:04.605
Ugh, this is my worst
nightmare, man.

09:04.638 --> 09:06.373
This is absolutely terrible.
How much further?

09:06.407 --> 09:07.875
Anyone know? Mac?

09:07.908 --> 09:09.910
How much further? Mac?

09:09.944 --> 09:11.779
Mac? Hello?

09:11.812 --> 09:15.082
(whispering): My mom's finger
is up, which means "no talking".

09:15.115 --> 09:16.784
She's annoyed. It's best if we

09:16.817 --> 09:18.986
just keep it down
until the finger goes down,

09:19.019 --> 09:21.489
otherwise, she might burn us
with the cigarette lighter.

09:21.522 --> 09:23.657
(whispers):
This is my worst nightmare

09:23.691 --> 09:24.959
in my entire life.

09:25.893 --> 09:27.995
(normal volume):
Okay, finger's down. Um, great.

09:28.028 --> 09:29.864
Uh, okay, Mrs. Kelly,
you're gonna want to stay

09:29.897 --> 09:32.366
on the Jersey Turnpike
until you hit 287.

09:32.399 --> 09:34.502
You want to take 287
towards Hamburg.

09:34.535 --> 09:36.504
Mm, no. That--
No, you just stay on the 206

09:36.537 --> 09:37.505
the whole way up.

09:37.538 --> 09:38.806
No, no, we're gonna,

09:38.839 --> 09:39.907
we're gonna hit Hamburg
on the way.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.041
Why are we going to Hamburg?

09:41.075 --> 09:42.743
We're gonna visit
my Uncle Donald.

09:42.776 --> 09:45.546
-Donald McDonald
of Hamburger, New Jersey?
-Hamburg.

09:45.579 --> 09:47.515
A bunch of old letters that
weren't even written to you?

09:47.548 --> 09:49.049
That's not a legacy, it's
a bunch of meaningless shit.

09:49.083 --> 09:52.052
Not as meaningless as a jar
full of teeth. (screams)

09:52.086 --> 09:53.521
-CHARLIE: Ah! She got you.
She got you.
-Sorry, Mom, sorry, Mom.

09:53.554 --> 09:54.922
Sorry, Mom.
I didn't see the finger.

09:54.955 --> 09:56.791
No, her hand was not
in the air that time.

09:56.824 --> 09:58.359
-She burnt the shit out of me.
-You didn't even put your hand--

09:58.392 --> 10:00.394
-Oh, it's up now, it's up now.
-Yeah.

10:00.427 --> 10:02.463
DENNIS:
Frank, we got a little
surprise for you, bud.

10:02.496 --> 10:03.764
What's that?

10:03.798 --> 10:05.633
Hamburgers.

10:05.666 --> 10:07.635
-Oh, hamburgers?
-(laughs)

10:07.668 --> 10:09.603
Oh, that's one
of the best food there is.

10:09.637 --> 10:11.772
Yeah, yes, they really are.

10:11.806 --> 10:13.874
And, you know what, you can eat
them right here in the car.

10:13.908 --> 10:16.610
You know, once in a while,
they give me the runs.

10:16.644 --> 10:18.913
Yeah, that's why we put
that towel down for you, buddy.

10:18.946 --> 10:21.081
Mmm. Mmm!

10:21.115 --> 10:22.917
-(smacking lips)
-Okay. All right.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.318
-Mmm.
-You want to take it easy?

10:24.351 --> 10:25.653
Goddamn. Just one bite
at a time,

10:25.686 --> 10:26.887
or you're gonna barf everywhere.

10:26.921 --> 10:29.023
-Mmm.
-Yeah, it's good, huh?

10:29.056 --> 10:30.991
Yeah, really hammering them
down there, huh, bud?

10:31.025 --> 10:32.326
Very good. Mmm.

10:34.395 --> 10:36.530
Oh! (laughs)

10:36.564 --> 10:37.998
I almost ate my gun.

10:38.032 --> 10:39.033
(laughing)

10:39.066 --> 10:40.067
I dipped it in the ketchup.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.335
Thought it was a french fry.

10:41.368 --> 10:42.336
Yeah, that is funny. (laughs)

10:42.369 --> 10:43.337
Wow.

10:43.370 --> 10:44.472
Hey, you know what?

10:44.505 --> 10:45.473
I'm-I'm gonna pull over, Frank.

10:45.506 --> 10:47.508
I got to take a piss anyway.

10:47.541 --> 10:48.976
Again. Okay.

10:50.845 --> 10:53.514
-DENNIS: Well, Frank...
-FRANK: What?

10:53.547 --> 10:54.648
DENNIS:
Look where we are.

10:54.682 --> 10:56.050
We're at the bridge.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.352
Oh, I haven't been here
in forever.

10:58.385 --> 10:59.987
-Go check it out-- Oh!
-Oh!
-Oh.

11:00.020 --> 11:02.590
-Ooh.
-Did-did you just slam your head
into the window?

11:02.623 --> 11:04.592
Yeah, I didn't realize
it was up.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.460
Well, were you gonna
dive out of it?

11:06.494 --> 11:08.496
Yeah, I was very excited.
I want to go.

11:08.529 --> 11:09.997
-All right.
-Go see the boys.

11:10.030 --> 11:11.332
-Have fun, buddy.
-Go see the boys.

11:11.365 --> 11:13.334
-Get after it.
-(chuckles) Okay.

11:13.367 --> 11:15.870
-FRANK: Okay.
-I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

11:15.903 --> 11:18.038
Hey, we're almost there, Dee,
okay? He's getting tired.

11:18.072 --> 11:19.874
Let's let run him around
the bridge for a little while,

11:19.907 --> 11:21.842
-and then we have
one more stop, okay?
-Uh...

11:25.412 --> 11:27.815
Oh, he's pissing
on another hydrant.

11:27.848 --> 11:29.517
Okay. He's...

11:29.550 --> 11:31.886
literally turning into a dog.

11:31.919 --> 11:32.953
Yeah.

11:35.089 --> 11:37.491
I got to smash.

11:37.525 --> 11:39.627
You just smashed. You smashed,
like, three times

11:39.660 --> 11:41.462
on the way up here.
We keep having to pull over

11:41.495 --> 11:43.063
-so you can smash. What...
-There is a lot of smashing.

11:43.097 --> 11:44.598
She's very regular.

11:44.632 --> 11:46.367
Oh, no, I'm out of paper towels.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.469
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that, Mrs. Kelly.

11:48.502 --> 11:50.504
I'm sure my Uncle Donald
has toilet paper.

11:50.538 --> 11:51.639
You've been wiping
with paper towels?

11:51.672 --> 11:54.074
I hope everyone

11:54.108 --> 11:55.943
brought their appetite

11:55.976 --> 11:58.512
because I made quiche.

11:58.546 --> 11:59.880
-(gasps)
-(laughs)

11:59.914 --> 12:01.882
Aw, that's really nice,
Uncle Donald,

12:01.916 --> 12:03.350
but we're kind of in a hurry.

12:03.384 --> 12:05.719
W-Well, that's a shame.
(stammers)

12:05.753 --> 12:07.388
We never get to see each other.

12:07.421 --> 12:09.657
Yeah, that is a shame,

12:09.690 --> 12:12.626
but I'm really here
about the letters.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.728
You know, the letters that

12:14.762 --> 12:16.530
Grandpop wrote to you and Dad
during the war.

12:16.564 --> 12:19.900
Oh. Oh, yes, yes,
I-I-I have those letters.

12:19.934 --> 12:21.602
Oh, that's great.

12:21.635 --> 12:23.471
I was kind of hoping
they would pass down to me.

12:23.504 --> 12:25.473
You know, sort of like
a family heirloom.

12:25.506 --> 12:27.808
Well, that would make sense
because, well,

12:27.842 --> 12:29.877
they weren't actually
written to me.

12:29.910 --> 12:33.013
They were addressed
only, uh, to your dad.

12:33.047 --> 12:35.783
Grandpop didn't write to you?

12:35.816 --> 12:38.519
He-he liked your dad,
uh... more.

12:38.552 --> 12:40.354
Uh, you know, I was the, um,

12:40.387 --> 12:41.889
you know, "funny" one, you know.

12:41.922 --> 12:44.058
It's the reason
I never got married.

12:44.091 --> 12:46.727
Not something we talked about
back then, but...

12:46.760 --> 12:49.363
but i-it always made me feel,

12:49.396 --> 12:52.032
uh, a little, uh...

12:52.066 --> 12:54.401
different.

12:54.435 --> 12:56.036
Well, I-I'm sure
you can understand

12:56.070 --> 12:57.438
what that feels like, Ronald.

12:59.807 --> 13:00.941
No.

13:00.975 --> 13:03.043
So, the letters?

13:03.077 --> 13:05.513
-Oh, yes. (laughing)
-Yeah?

13:05.546 --> 13:07.515
-CHARLIE: Oh!
- Sure.

13:07.548 --> 13:09.383
Okay.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.585
Yeah, this is, uh,
this is great, Uncle Donald,

13:11.619 --> 13:12.853
'cause it's really gonna tie

13:12.887 --> 13:14.655
a lot of things together
for me, you know?

13:14.688 --> 13:16.657
It's, uh-- I have something
to pass down to my kids.

13:16.690 --> 13:18.392
It's-it's important
to have a legacy.

13:18.425 --> 13:19.860
Oh, yes. You know, I...

13:19.894 --> 13:21.996
I wouldn't know, though.
I, you know, I...

13:22.029 --> 13:24.031
I don't have
any children of my own.

13:24.064 --> 13:26.066
Oh, yeah.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.868
-(whispers): What is
this guy's deal?
-DONALD: Oh, here they are.

13:27.902 --> 13:29.904
(whispers): It's, like,
everything you've ever wanted.

13:29.937 --> 13:32.773
Kind of sad, really, uh,
me keeping letters

13:32.807 --> 13:35.342
that, uh, weren't even for me.

13:35.376 --> 13:37.611
(laughs)
You know. But, uh...

13:37.645 --> 13:41.048
I guess I just, uh,
wanted a connection, uh...

13:41.081 --> 13:42.883
(sniffles)

13:42.917 --> 13:44.418
...with my dad.

13:45.686 --> 13:47.054
Yeah.

13:47.087 --> 13:50.658
That is sad.

13:50.691 --> 13:52.760
If I could just-- Yeah.
Thank you.

13:52.793 --> 13:55.329
I mean, you know,
there's nothing more...

13:55.362 --> 13:57.398
more important in this world
than the connection

13:57.431 --> 13:59.033
between a father and a son.

13:59.066 --> 14:01.936
Well, besides the connection
between a son and a mother.

14:01.969 --> 14:03.604
Right, Mom?

14:05.639 --> 14:07.007
She's smashing.

14:07.041 --> 14:09.510
-Yeah, she took off, man.
-Yeah, she had to smash.

14:09.543 --> 14:12.646
Well, I guess we could wait
for her in the car.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.014
This is so annoying.

14:14.048 --> 14:15.883
I mean, you're gonna
take time out of my day,

14:15.916 --> 14:17.485
and you have everything you've
ever dreamed of right here,

14:17.518 --> 14:19.019
but we're gonna just blow
right past it, aren't we?

14:19.053 --> 14:20.588
It's probably time to go, huh?

14:20.621 --> 14:22.623
-Well, uh, o-okay.
-Yeah.

14:22.656 --> 14:24.058
Okay, well-well, uh,
you know, hey,

14:24.091 --> 14:26.026
if you ever want to, uh,
you know, hang out,

14:26.060 --> 14:28.496
you know, we could throw
the old football around.

14:28.529 --> 14:30.364
Ah, I don't really like
playing football.

14:30.397 --> 14:31.765
It's kind of for jocks.

14:31.799 --> 14:33.501
-It's all he ever talks about...
-No, it's like...

14:33.534 --> 14:34.902
...is wanting to have
a catch with his dad, so...

14:34.935 --> 14:35.936
Nah, 'cause remember
we were talking about how

14:35.970 --> 14:37.404
it was like a... for jocks?

14:37.438 --> 14:39.373
-Uh, no. That never happened.
-Oh.

14:39.406 --> 14:41.008
Uh, yeah, well, uh,
we could read.

14:41.041 --> 14:42.743
-We could read.
-Oh, but, like, he can't read.

14:42.776 --> 14:44.512
-Imagine that. Imagine that.
-He can't read, so...

14:44.545 --> 14:45.746
Yeah, but he's not talking
about me, he's talking about

14:45.779 --> 14:47.348
-bonding with you.
-Yeah, like...

14:47.381 --> 14:48.382
But we're gonna
blow right past this, huh?

14:48.415 --> 14:49.617
Reading is for nerds, so...

14:49.650 --> 14:50.785
-Yeah, is that what it is?
-Yeah.

14:50.818 --> 14:52.386
-Uh, cards?
-Uh, well,

14:52.419 --> 14:53.988
the thing about cards
is, like, with the...

14:54.021 --> 14:56.891
the jacks and the queens
and the kings and, like,

14:56.924 --> 14:58.592
I don't like
celebrating royalty.

14:58.626 --> 15:00.494
-You know, he-he knows that.
-Oh, my God, dude.

15:00.528 --> 15:02.329
-Oh, my God, man.
-You know that.
We've talked about that.

15:02.363 --> 15:04.532
You're driving me crazy, dude.
All right, fine, let's go.

15:04.565 --> 15:06.801
-Bye-bye.
-Okay, maybe you guys
can swap phone numbers or...

15:06.834 --> 15:09.470
-I think that would be weird.
-No? No, not gonna do it?

15:09.503 --> 15:10.437
-That would be weird. Okay.
-Fine, then this was a good
waste of our time, wasn't it?

15:15.009 --> 15:16.977
-Well, t

15:17.011 --> 15:18.512
-Yep.
-Mm.

15:18.546 --> 15:19.480
DENNIS: Beautiful.
Probably brings back

15:19.513 --> 15:20.614
a lot of good memories.

15:20.648 --> 15:21.982
-Right, Frank?
-Absolutely.

15:22.016 --> 15:24.952
-Yeah.
-You guys, uh, mind if I...

15:24.985 --> 15:27.488
-Oh, no. Of course. No, please.
Please. Yeah.
-Please. Yeah.

15:28.889 --> 15:30.691
Take that you, cesspool.

15:30.724 --> 15:33.694
Polluted sack of shit.

15:33.727 --> 15:36.030
You know, Dee, I kind of feel
like we did a good thing here.

15:36.063 --> 15:38.666
I do, too.
We gave him a good day.

15:38.699 --> 15:40.434
-Mm-hmm.
-For him.

15:40.468 --> 15:41.902
Not for a normal person.

15:41.936 --> 15:43.404
-(chuckles)
-Yeah. Jesus.

15:45.339 --> 15:46.574
Right.

15:46.607 --> 15:47.708
You all done, bud?

15:47.741 --> 15:50.311
-Yeah. Thanks, guys.
-Yeah.

15:50.344 --> 15:51.912
-Good. Hey, oh, absolutely.
-Yeah.

15:51.946 --> 15:53.848
-You got it.
-Hey, listen,
where to now, Frank?

15:53.881 --> 15:55.416
-We want to take you somewhere.
-Uh, no, it's okay. I get it.

15:55.449 --> 15:57.384
I-I thought it was
a cash grab at first,

15:57.418 --> 15:58.986
but I see where you're going.

15:59.019 --> 16:01.822
The hamburger, playing
with Duncan under the bridge,

16:01.856 --> 16:03.290
and now the beach.

16:03.324 --> 16:04.692
A perfect day
can't last forever.

16:04.725 --> 16:06.494
I know why we're here.

16:06.527 --> 16:08.596
Oh. You do?

16:08.629 --> 16:09.997
(chuckles)
Gosh.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.565
Thanks for making it
so easy on us.

16:11.599 --> 16:13.400
-We expected more resistance.
-Yeah.

16:13.434 --> 16:15.703
Well, I guess hung on
a little bit too long.

16:15.736 --> 16:18.072
-A little bit.
-And afterwards,
you guys can have the money.

16:18.105 --> 16:19.940
-(gasps) You mean it?
-Really?

16:19.974 --> 16:21.842
Yeah. Here.

16:21.876 --> 16:23.777
Oh. Gosh.

16:23.811 --> 16:25.980
I-I got to say, this-this went

16:26.013 --> 16:27.815
-so much more smoothly than I...
-Yeah, it really did.

16:27.848 --> 16:30.484
Uh, just do it when I'm looking
out at the ocean.

16:33.387 --> 16:34.522
Huh?

16:34.555 --> 16:37.358
Ah, don't be coy.
I had a good run.

16:37.391 --> 16:38.826
-What are you...
-And it's really good

16:38.859 --> 16:39.927
you didn't do it
in front of Charlie.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.061
That was a class move.

16:41.095 --> 16:42.930
Just put me down quick.

16:44.632 --> 16:46.300
Put you down? Wha...

16:46.333 --> 16:47.768
Oh, you know what?
I think I'm gonna run,

16:47.802 --> 16:49.737
and then you do
what you have to do.

16:49.770 --> 16:52.339
But if you shoot me in the leg,
come over and finish me off,

16:52.373 --> 16:53.841
because I don't want
to lay there and suffer.

16:53.874 --> 16:55.409
-Actually, here,
I'm gonna take...
-What?

16:55.442 --> 16:56.777
What the hell are you doing?

16:56.811 --> 16:58.846
I'm gonna go natural,
because I've seen

16:58.879 --> 17:01.849
too many guys die
and take a shit in their pants.

17:01.882 --> 17:03.617
I don't want that.
And bury my poop.

17:03.651 --> 17:05.519
Or just kick some sand over it.

17:05.553 --> 17:07.455
'Cause-- And then you can do
what you want to do.

17:07.488 --> 17:10.024
You can float me out into
the ocean and let sharks eat me.

17:10.057 --> 17:11.425
Or you can leave me
on the ground,

17:11.459 --> 17:12.626
gruesome for the kids to see.

17:12.660 --> 17:14.595
Oh, ugh. Oh, my God.

17:14.628 --> 17:16.730
We are not gonna
kill you, Frank.

17:16.764 --> 17:18.732
-Huh?
-What, did you think

17:18.766 --> 17:20.835
we were just gonna shoot you
right here on the beach?

17:20.868 --> 17:22.369
I mean,
there-there's people around.

17:22.403 --> 17:23.971
I'm actually surprised
they didn't run

17:24.004 --> 17:25.873
-when you started
shooting the ocean.
-I-I'm not.

17:25.906 --> 17:27.975
It's the Jersey Shore.
But good God, man.

17:28.008 --> 17:29.543
Well, if you're not gonna
snuff me out,

17:29.577 --> 17:31.011
what the hell are you doing?

17:31.045 --> 17:32.847
We were giving you
one last day with your gun.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.615
Yeah, it's time
to let it go, Frank.

17:34.648 --> 17:35.883
You were stealing my gun?

17:35.916 --> 17:36.984
-DENNIS: Well...
-Screw that.

17:37.017 --> 17:38.419
No, it's too dangerous, Frank.

17:38.452 --> 17:39.820
You're out of control
with that thing.

17:39.854 --> 17:41.555
By the way,
you're out of the will again.

17:41.589 --> 17:42.923
-What?
-Why? Just because of the gun?
-Yeah.

17:42.957 --> 17:45.926
Exactly. Because I don't
trust you two guys.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.762
I mean, if you're in the will,
who knows?

17:48.796 --> 17:50.598
You may wind up
shooting me in the back.

17:50.631 --> 17:53.000
-Ah!
-You just told us
to shoot you in the back!

17:53.033 --> 17:54.702
That's different.
It's not the same thing.

17:54.735 --> 17:55.803
Take me back to Philly.

17:55.836 --> 17:56.971
You get an Uber.

17:57.004 --> 17:58.539
-DENNIS: Yeah.
-Get in the car.

17:58.572 --> 18:00.074
-Goddamn it.
-Go on. Let's go.
-Dee,

18:00.107 --> 18:01.542
-why'd you let him snatch
that thing back?
-I-I...

18:03.811 --> 18:05.779
All right, let's go.

18:05.813 --> 18:07.815
-Just barge right in, Mom.
-O-Okay.

18:07.848 --> 18:09.884
Don't-don't be shy, okay?

18:09.917 --> 18:11.719
Bunny?

18:11.752 --> 18:13.754
Candy?

18:13.788 --> 18:16.924
-Are you home?
-Which one is the can?

18:16.957 --> 18:18.392
There's probably, like,
a million bathrooms.

18:18.425 --> 18:20.361
Just go find a bathroom,
Mrs. Mac.

18:20.394 --> 18:22.863
-(groans)
-I don't remember those
being your sisters' names.

18:22.897 --> 18:24.865
No, it's not their names.
They had their names changed.

18:24.899 --> 18:27.368
Oh. How do they afford
to live like this?

18:27.401 --> 18:28.369
T-They're doing
some, like, stupid,

18:28.402 --> 18:30.004
like, social media thing.

18:30.037 --> 18:31.438
I-I don't know, I guess
they're making a killing on it.

18:31.472 --> 18:34.008
Hey! Candy, Bunny!

18:34.041 --> 18:35.509
-Candy...
-Oh, my God.

18:35.543 --> 18:36.811
BOTH:
Mom, what are you doing here?

18:36.844 --> 18:38.712
Well, we just wanted
to drive up...

18:38.746 --> 18:40.014
BOTH:
Why'd you bring Dirt Grub?

18:40.047 --> 18:41.315
Oh, yeah, hi.
Nice to see you, too.

18:41.348 --> 18:42.416
BOTH:
Shut up, fag!

18:42.449 --> 18:43.450
Why'd you bring your fag friend?

18:43.484 --> 18:44.552
Yeah, why is Mac here?

18:44.585 --> 18:46.821
-(sighs)
-This is so distasteful.

18:46.854 --> 18:48.522
Uh, dude, uh...

18:48.556 --> 18:49.757
You know what? I'm not
gonna argue with you guys.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.292
-Oh, you're not?
-Okay? No, I'm just here

18:51.325 --> 18:52.593
-for the teeth.
-No, you can't have them.

18:52.626 --> 18:54.028
Yeah, you can't
have them, Charlie.

18:54.061 --> 18:55.596
-You can't have them.
-Mom gave them to us.

18:55.629 --> 18:57.398
Well, what do you even care
about the teeth?

18:57.431 --> 18:58.866
I-I thought you always said
they were weird and gross.

18:58.899 --> 19:00.434
-They are weird and gross.
-Yeah, super gross,

19:00.468 --> 19:01.702
but people like that stuff,
so we need them.

19:01.735 --> 19:03.437
-We need them.
-Need them for what?

19:03.471 --> 19:04.705
ASMR, dickweed.

19:04.738 --> 19:06.974
Yeah. ASMR.

19:07.007 --> 19:08.876
What is that? What even is that?

19:08.909 --> 19:11.412
We stick our hands in the jar.

19:11.445 --> 19:13.447
People pay to watch us
stick our hand in the jar.

19:13.481 --> 19:14.915
-They pay for that shit.
-Yeah.

19:14.949 --> 19:16.550
They like the noise
of the teeth,

19:16.584 --> 19:17.718
and they give us a lot
of money on OnlyFans.

19:17.751 --> 19:19.420
-Like, a lot of money.
-What?

19:19.453 --> 19:21.355
-More than you could
ever imagine.
-Yeah.

19:21.388 --> 19:22.990
All your doing is sticking
your hands in teeth

19:23.023 --> 19:24.959
and people pay you enough
to live like this?

19:24.992 --> 19:27.995
-We obviously take
our tops off. Like...
-Obviously.

19:28.028 --> 19:29.530
-Oh, girls.
-BUNNY: Oh, my God.

19:29.563 --> 19:31.398
-Shut up, slut.
-You're literally a slut.

19:31.432 --> 19:33.000
All right, you know what? Give
me the teeth. Give me the teeth.

19:33.033 --> 19:34.535
No. Finders keepers, bitch.

19:34.568 --> 19:35.870
-Finders keepers.
-You did not find them!

19:35.903 --> 19:37.571
-Mom gave them to you.
-Yeah, she did.

19:37.605 --> 19:39.673
-Okay, we're her favorite.
-I clogged the toilet.

19:39.707 --> 19:42.643
-What the hell? Gross.
-Who is this old lady
clogging our toilet?

19:42.676 --> 19:43.744
That's my mommy.

19:43.777 --> 19:45.379
BOTH:
Gross, Mac!

19:45.412 --> 19:46.614
Why did you clog our toilet?

19:46.647 --> 19:48.382
Why'd you clog our toilet,
old lady?

19:48.415 --> 19:50.317
There was no TP.

19:50.351 --> 19:52.853
If there was no TP,
what did you wipe with?

19:53.854 --> 19:54.989
The letters.

19:56.090 --> 19:57.992
You wiped your butt
with the letters

19:58.025 --> 19:59.994
that Grandpop sent Dad and then
flushed them down the toilet?

20:00.027 --> 20:01.762
Yeah.

20:01.796 --> 20:03.430
-(groans)
-BUNNY: Oh, my God.

20:03.464 --> 20:04.899
This is so weird, guys.
You got to go.

20:04.932 --> 20:06.500
-All right, you know what?
-No. No.

20:06.534 --> 20:07.902
Hey, hey. Put that down.

20:07.935 --> 20:09.670
This is gonna be
the new Kelly family heirloom,

20:09.703 --> 20:11.505
and I'm gonna put
all my teeth in it

20:11.539 --> 20:14.508
and all of Mom's teeth in it
and none of yours.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.443
(Charlie groaning)

20:16.477 --> 20:17.611
Okay.

20:17.645 --> 20:18.846
(mumbles)
Oh, uh, yep.

20:18.879 --> 20:20.714
-Yep. Yep.
-You got to stop

20:20.748 --> 20:22.883
doing that. You're not gonna
have any teeth left.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.518
You sure you don't want
to pop a couple in?

20:24.552 --> 20:25.553
You know, you can be
a part of my legacy, dude.

20:25.586 --> 20:26.554
I-I feel like you should be.

20:26.587 --> 20:27.988
-No, I-I'm good.
-Yeah?

20:28.022 --> 20:29.623
-Yeah, I'm good.
-All right, I'll tell you what.

20:29.657 --> 20:30.691
When one-one falls out,
go ahead and toss it in.

20:30.724 --> 20:32.526
-It's cool.
-It won't.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.029
(gunshots)

20:36.030 --> 20:38.632
Yeah. There. Take that, lock.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.969
Oh, what the hell, man?

20:42.002 --> 20:43.737
And the door wasn't even locked.

20:43.771 --> 20:44.972
You're paying
for that door, Frank.

20:45.005 --> 20:46.540
All right, all right.

20:46.574 --> 20:48.843
Well, this is great.
This is just great.

20:48.876 --> 20:49.977
You know, like, now
what are we supposed to all put

20:50.010 --> 20:51.979
-our teeth in?
-Our faces?

20:52.012 --> 20:53.714
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about our legacy.

20:53.747 --> 20:55.549
You know?
I can't hold onto it, man.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.284
Legacy? You want to talk legacy?
You know what our legacy is?

20:57.318 --> 20:58.619
Spending our lives
in this goddamn bar

20:58.652 --> 21:00.821
with a lunatic man
who acts like a dog

21:00.855 --> 21:02.690
and handles
his gun like a maniac!

21:02.723 --> 21:04.558
Oh, fine.

21:04.592 --> 21:07.495
I see where this
pity party's headed.

21:07.528 --> 21:09.563
If you're gonna be
crybabies about it,

21:09.597 --> 21:11.765
all right, take my gun.

21:14.435 --> 21:15.970
-Ow! Ow!
-Shit!

21:16.003 --> 21:17.571
(all groaning)

21:17.605 --> 21:18.873
Shit.

21:18.906 --> 21:20.875
Well, there you have it, Frank.

21:20.908 --> 21:23.344
You've officially shot
