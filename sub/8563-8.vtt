WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
November, 1944-

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Peleliu was an American victory,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
But it came at great cost.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The 1st marine division lost
more than 1/3 of their men,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Suffering over 6,500 casualties.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
On Peleliu we... we were...

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
What I would call a bunch of raggedy-ass
marines when that battle was over.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Ultimately general MacArthur

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
would not use Peleliu in retaking
the Philippines.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Nor was the island ever used
for any future operations.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Few would hear of the fierce
battle fought on Peleliu.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Peleliu was a forgotten battle.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And I want it to be known
that there was a battle there

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And it was an S.O.B.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
For every marine that was on there.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
By February of 1945,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
U.S. Forces were converging on a tiny island

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Only 660 miles from the Japanese mainland.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Iwo Jima-

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Eight square miles of volcanic rock and Ash.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
But it held an airfield vital

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
To the planned invasion of mainland Japan.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We knew as marines
if we landed on that island

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
That if we didn't get killed
we could win that war.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
But I was scared, yes.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
To be perfectly honest
about it, everybody was.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I don't know anybody that could
claim they weren't scared.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
30,000 marines landed
on the beaches of Iwo Jima.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It was the only battle in the war

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
where American casualties
outnumbered the Japanese.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
A lot of good marines got killed there.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I think I was blessed by getting wounded

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
cause I probably wouldn't be here today

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
If I had stayed on.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
cause there aren't many of us that got out.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It's a hell of a lot easier to raise
money when there's a face behind it

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And a heroic story attached to it like yours.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I don't feel like a hero, sir.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
What kind of man would risk his life

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Running much needed ammunition

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Back and forth to his
buddies on the front line?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
John.
- A fighting man like no other.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Sergeant John Basilone.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You have no idea what's coming at you.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Better keep your head down.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You can't dwell on it.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You can't dwell on any of it.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Sniper got the Skipper.

00:00.000 --> 03:01.282
Captain Haldane?
- Ack-ack... Ack-ack's dead.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.916
You've gotta take more salt than this.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.586
You're just depleting yourself, all right?

04:09.769 --> 04:11.769
Are my eyes yellow?

04:12.504 --> 04:14.072
Why would your eyes be yellow?

04:14.172 --> 04:16.892
Come on,
your old man's a doctor.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.967
Look at my eyes.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.646
Give it a rest, snafu.

04:20.746 --> 04:22.746
Seriously.

04:22.814 --> 04:24.682
I'm getting that yellow jaundice

04:24.782 --> 04:26.517
That's been going around.
I know it.

04:26.617 --> 04:27.985
The heebie-jeebies.

04:28.085 --> 04:30.053
It's hepatitis and you don't have it.

04:30.153 --> 04:32.556
I'll catch a fever then turn inside out

04:32.656 --> 04:36.566
Through my asshole
like Carson in love company.

04:38.330 --> 04:40.632
Come on, look at my eyes.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.969
I'm dying, sledge.
- Hey.

04:45.069 --> 04:47.137
Hey.

04:47.237 --> 04:48.804
Check out my eyes, Jay.

04:48.904 --> 04:51.304
They look yellow?

04:52.406 --> 04:54.807
I just got transferred out of king.

04:54.907 --> 04:56.241
What?

04:56.341 --> 04:57.342
Where?

04:57.442 --> 04:59.543
Headquarters company.

05:00.779 --> 05:02.346
It'll be all right, Jay.

05:02.446 --> 05:04.781
Shit. You're just down the road.

05:04.881 --> 05:08.017
Yeah, I'm just down the road.

05:09.853 --> 05:14.613
Least I can do is buy you guys
a drink at the slop shoot.

05:18.727 --> 05:21.463
This is NBC,

05:21.563 --> 05:24.453
The national broadcasting company.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.134
Carlo works at a camouflage factory

05:27.234 --> 05:30.634
And Angelo is a fireman at an army depot

05:30.702 --> 05:33.072
In their home of Raritan, New Jersey.

05:33.172 --> 05:35.807
Well, you brothers have a lot to talk over.

05:35.907 --> 05:38.408
What do you say, Carlo?

05:40.010 --> 05:43.379
Well, for one thing, I'd like to
be out there fighting with Johnny,

05:43.479 --> 05:45.982
Instead of making camouflage paint.

05:46.082 --> 05:47.984
That's where you're wrong, Carlo.

05:48.084 --> 05:50.453
Some guys have to fight, sure,

05:50.553 --> 05:52.921
But some guys have to give
us the stuff to fight with.

05:53.021 --> 05:55.922
I'll never forget that day
you left for overseas.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.223
Johnny, remember?

05:57.323 --> 05:58.991
All of us kids at mom's house,

05:59.091 --> 06:01.095
And after putting away all that grub.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.398
Ha-ha, that's right.
You got up to go

06:03.498 --> 06:05.433
And all you said was,
'goodbye, folks.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.067
Be seeing you in the funnies.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.437
And that's just what happened.
- Yeah, sure sure.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.806
Go ahead, Johnny. Tell us about the
night you killed all those Japs.

06:13.906 --> 06:17.076
Remember? You were out in the jungle,
standing guard from 8:00 till midnight.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.511
It was raining.
- It had stopped raining.

06:19.611 --> 06:22.413
My guns began throwing a lot of stuff

06:22.513 --> 06:24.515
And plenty of stuff was coming back.

06:24.615 --> 06:27.984
I was in charge of two sections
of heavy machine guns.

06:28.084 --> 06:30.887
While the enemy was hammering
out our defensive positions,

06:30.987 --> 06:34.725
We fought valiantly to check the
savage and determined assault.

06:34.825 --> 06:37.227
The fierce frontal attack-

06:37.327 --> 06:39.329
Oh, this is good.
- That's right.

06:39.429 --> 06:42.997
Can I have some more?

06:43.097 --> 06:44.565
Yeah, dad,
I was so nervous.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.533
I've never been more nervous.
Let me tell you.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.201
Hey, sweetheart,
I was good though.

06:48.301 --> 06:50.134
I sounded like a movie star, right?

06:50.234 --> 06:52.169
I don't know.
I was shaking like a leaf.

06:52.269 --> 06:54.071
Of course, pa. Of course.

06:54.171 --> 06:58.575
Moses said I sounded like a movie star.
That's me, right?

06:58.675 --> 07:02.755
I sound like that too,
pa- the voice of an angel.

07:06.515 --> 07:10.252
Oh, Johnny,
we're so proud of you.

07:11.654 --> 07:14.054
Ma, all I do is dress up
and say what they tell me.

07:14.154 --> 07:16.421
Well, everyone in America
knows the family name

07:16.521 --> 07:18.289
Because of you, Johnny.
That's right.

07:18.389 --> 07:20.992
I don't want everyone to know me.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.294
But they do,

07:23.394 --> 07:26.097
Because you're so special.

07:26.197 --> 07:28.399
Hey, I get free drinks
because of my hero brother.

07:28.499 --> 07:29.500
How about that, huh?
- That's right.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.834
I love that, Johnny.
- Yeah, me too.

07:43.076 --> 07:45.411
This looks great, ma.
What's the matter?

07:45.511 --> 07:47.346
It smells good, ma.
Thanks, ma.

07:47.446 --> 07:51.583
What did I say?
- Mom, he just needs some time.

07:51.683 --> 07:53.683
That's all.

08:40.188 --> 08:42.656
What can I do for you?

08:42.756 --> 08:44.756
Sir, I joined the corps

08:44.841 --> 08:46.494
Because I knew the marines
were gonna be the ones

08:46.594 --> 08:48.496
Who went in first and the hardest,

08:48.596 --> 08:50.532
And that's how it worked out.

08:50.632 --> 08:55.170
But I've been back more than a year, sir.

08:55.270 --> 08:57.239
I've done what the corps asked me to do.

08:57.339 --> 08:59.207
Well, that you have, John.

08:59.307 --> 09:01.542
Well, I see your enlistment's
up in six months.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.111
I'll tell you what- I'll
push through your discharge,

09:04.211 --> 09:08.801
Let you go home now.
- No, sir, that's not what I mean.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.083
My home is the corps.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.687
I just can't push pencils anymore.

09:14.787 --> 09:18.423
Please, let me go back
and train the new kids,

09:18.523 --> 09:21.225
Let me help them the way I know how.

09:21.325 --> 09:23.828
Sergeant Basilone,

09:23.928 --> 09:26.396
You make me proud to be a ma.

09:28.632 --> 09:30.632
Thank you, sir.

09:36.972 --> 09:38.972
Sergeant Basilone.

09:47.147 --> 09:49.816
They brought you back after Guadalcanal?

09:49.916 --> 09:51.984
Yes, sir.

09:52.084 --> 09:53.786
I was at Tarawa.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.606
No war bond drive for me though.

09:58.256 --> 10:00.792
I guess it's good to have another
combat veteran training.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.660
Where's the rest of the company?

10:02.760 --> 10:06.063
I'm told they're coming
in three days- a week.

10:06.163 --> 10:09.100
What would you like to
do until then, Captain?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.868
Take it easy.
Put your feet up.

10:12.937 --> 10:15.005
Whatever you want.

11:16.457 --> 11:19.858
Company. Fall in on your racks.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.059
Shit.

11:28.129 --> 11:30.763
Names. - Tatum, Charles.
Private first class.

11:30.863 --> 11:33.838
Evanson, Steve.
Private first class.

11:34.766 --> 11:36.766
Well, Tatum, Evanson,

11:36.849 --> 11:39.468
Why do I find you in your racks
in the middle of the day?

11:39.568 --> 11:41.302
We've had no orders, sergeant.

11:41.402 --> 11:44.071
So you've been doing what
you've been told to do-

11:44.171 --> 11:46.806
Nothing.
- Aye, sergeant.

11:48.309 --> 11:50.510
As of now you are
the first machine-gun squad

11:50.610 --> 11:52.845
In b company's weapons platoon.

11:52.945 --> 11:54.747
Fall in for p. T.,
five-mile run.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.848
Three minutes.
- Aye, sergeant.

11:58.883 --> 12:00.217
That's John Basilone.

12:00.317 --> 12:02.319
Who the hell is John Basilone?

12:02.419 --> 12:04.884
Jesus. Do you live in a cave?

12:05.756 --> 12:08.091
The guy killed like 1,000 Japs on the canal.

12:08.191 --> 12:10.460
The president gave him a medal. He's a hero.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.762
Let's go. Let's go.
Move. Move your ass.

12:13.862 --> 12:16.965
You've got to go faster than that.
The Japs are killing your buddies.

12:17.065 --> 12:19.467
Get up that net. Move.

12:19.567 --> 12:22.303
1500 marines waiting
to follow you down that net.

12:22.403 --> 12:25.139
The sea is pitching and rolling.
It's not steady like this.

12:25.239 --> 12:27.841
Now we're doing the range at 1400.

12:27.941 --> 12:29.510
Go draw your weapons and stand by to move.

12:29.610 --> 12:31.812
Aye, gunny.

12:31.912 --> 12:34.014
The Jap banzai charge is right there.

12:34.114 --> 12:35.881
They're coming,
damn it. Hurry.

12:35.981 --> 12:37.483
You drop that gun,
I'll make you carry it

12:37.583 --> 12:39.351
For one solid month.

12:39.451 --> 12:42.354
Teamwork is the key to the
marine corps machine-gun squad.

12:42.454 --> 12:45.344
Set that pin on the tripod.
- Shit.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.692
Get that gun out of the dirt.

12:47.792 --> 12:49.260
Sorry, gunny.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.729
You drop your rifle in a
firefight, you die, Tatum.

12:51.829 --> 12:53.597
Drop that machine gun,
fumble with a belt,

12:53.697 --> 12:56.233
Your buddies die.
Do you understand?

12:56.333 --> 12:58.333
Aye, gunny.

13:01.470 --> 13:03.738
You cannot fuck this up, ever.

13:03.838 --> 13:06.841
Lives depend on it.

13:06.941 --> 13:09.809
Is that clear?
- Aye, gunny.

13:13.980 --> 13:16.214
Break it down.
Do it again.

13:29.359 --> 13:31.260
Hey, Greg?
- How you doing, John?

13:31.360 --> 13:33.395
How's the chow, boys?

13:33.495 --> 13:35.530
Sorry.
You stupid-

13:35.630 --> 13:39.115
Good hands. Good hands.
- Lend him a hand.

13:40.201 --> 13:41.969
Go on, get yourself some more.
- Yes, sergeant.

13:42.069 --> 13:44.103
Come on, move it.

13:45.706 --> 13:48.074
V.I.P. On deck.
- Who?

13:48.174 --> 13:50.109
That gunny with the ocean of hair.

13:50.209 --> 13:52.209
It's John Basilone.

13:53.814 --> 13:56.182
Oh, and he looks even better in person.

13:56.282 --> 13:58.282
Oh, and here he comes.

14:01.453 --> 14:03.453
Can I give you a hand?

14:03.520 --> 14:05.554
We've got it under control.

14:05.654 --> 14:07.987
Are you sure about that?

14:09.089 --> 14:10.923
Do you see these stripes?

14:11.023 --> 14:13.403
I'm an n. C.O.
Just like you.

14:13.464 --> 14:15.925
I have work to do.

14:18.661 --> 14:22.096
What's her name?
- Sergeant Lena Riggi.

14:24.332 --> 14:26.166
I'm Lucy.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.435
You know, every Friday

14:28.535 --> 14:30.803
Us girls catch the 6:00 train to L.A.,

14:30.903 --> 14:34.006
Just in case you're interested.

15:11.676 --> 15:14.344
Sergeant Riggi.
- Yes.

15:14.444 --> 15:16.513
I'm assuming that's Italian, right?

15:16.613 --> 15:19.281
Here it comes.

15:19.381 --> 15:21.931
I'm Italian. You're Italian.

15:22.018 --> 15:24.354
Hey, we're both probably
related to Joe DiMaggio.

15:24.454 --> 15:27.959
You know, I know where we can
get the best lasagna in the city.

15:28.059 --> 15:30.864
I could go for some good lasagna.

15:31.496 --> 15:32.314
Look.

15:32.414 --> 15:36.304
L.A. Is full of girls for a guy like you.
You'll do fine.

15:36.404 --> 15:38.444
Happy hunting, sergeant.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.620
Sergeant.
- Gunny.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.885
If that's all right with you.
- Sergeant Basilone.

16:02.660 --> 16:04.428
Yeah.
- That's right.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.696
That's- oh, really?

16:06.796 --> 16:09.165
This is so nice.
I love it here.

16:09.265 --> 16:11.433
To better days.

16:14.470 --> 16:17.506
Hey.

16:17.606 --> 16:21.508
Boy, it's true what they say about you.

16:21.608 --> 16:24.277
You get shot down,
you keep coming back.

16:24.377 --> 16:28.542
What? Everybody comes
to the Biltmore, don't they?

16:29.347 --> 16:31.515
There's another medal in your future

16:31.615 --> 16:34.485
If you can get us a table.
- How long have you been waiting for?

16:34.585 --> 16:36.887
We gave up waiting.
It's like this every liberty.

16:36.987 --> 16:38.755
Well, I'll see what I can do.

16:38.855 --> 16:40.990
And what would that be, exactly?

16:41.090 --> 16:42.958
Making a table appear out of thin air?

16:43.058 --> 16:45.259
They know me.

16:48.396 --> 16:51.832
Oh, hey. - Big shot here
thinks he can get us a table.

16:51.932 --> 16:55.269
I want to make him prove it.
- No.

16:55.369 --> 16:59.038
You go. I'm thinking of joining the Navy.

17:02.644 --> 17:05.959
Looks like it'll just be the two of us.

17:20.253 --> 17:24.333
This place is bigger than
the house I grew up in.

17:24.412 --> 17:25.791
Yeah, I never ask for it,

17:25.891 --> 17:27.993
but they always put me up
in the presidential suite.

17:28.093 --> 17:30.996
And I'm supposed to be impressed?

17:31.096 --> 17:33.901
That's why you arranged all this?

17:33.966 --> 17:36.834
To impress me before
we get down to business?

17:36.934 --> 17:38.934
Business?

17:39.804 --> 17:42.473
Exploring the bed sheets together.

17:42.573 --> 17:44.107
No.

17:44.207 --> 17:47.977
Well, that's standard operating
procedure for you, isn't it?

17:48.077 --> 17:50.945
No. Not anymore.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.592
You know, I saw you once at the brown derby.

18:04.692 --> 18:07.127
Me and the girls were waiting to get in

18:07.227 --> 18:10.264
When you arrived with one of those
blonde starlets on your arm.

18:10.364 --> 18:13.366
There you went, right to
the front of the line,

18:13.466 --> 18:16.526
And everyone was saying, 'Ooh. Aah'.

18:16.587 --> 18:20.837
There goes John Basilone,
the hero of Guadalcanal.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.410
I was still there when out you came,

18:24.510 --> 18:26.245
A brunette starlet on your arm,

18:26.345 --> 18:28.180
And back into the same limousine.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.816
And everyone said,'Ooh. Aah'...

18:32.216 --> 18:34.030
There goes John Basilone,

18:34.130 --> 18:36.340
The hero of Guadalcanal.

18:38.857 --> 18:40.358
You ever make it inside?

18:40.458 --> 18:46.238
I had a shrimp cocktail and a coke
just before they closed the joint.

18:48.198 --> 18:51.001
Gunnery sergeant Basilone,
dinner was delicious.

18:51.101 --> 18:53.267
Thank you.
- You barely touched it.

18:53.367 --> 18:55.666
Did I do something wrong?

18:55.766 --> 18:58.769
This is nothing but steaks and conversation.

18:58.869 --> 19:01.605
I am now going to Turin.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.108
Turn in?
- We girls all share a room,

19:04.208 --> 19:05.909
Fight over the bathroom in the morning.

19:06.009 --> 19:08.277
Tell the chef the Caesar
salad was excellent.

19:08.377 --> 19:11.267
The porterhouse is a little tough.

19:12.111 --> 19:13.712
Lena,

19:13.812 --> 19:16.213
If I did something stupid, I'm sorry.

19:16.313 --> 19:18.715
You didn't do anything a million
other guys haven't done.

19:18.815 --> 19:21.947
You just did it in a nicer room.

19:26.719 --> 19:33.024
Left right left.
Left right left...

19:34.326 --> 19:36.260
Gunnery sergeant Basilone, sir.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.562
Stand at ease.

19:38.662 --> 19:40.729
I'm lieutenant Sohn.

19:40.829 --> 19:42.897
I'll be replacing Captain Le Francois,

19:42.997 --> 19:45.800
Who went AWOL while on liberty.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.195
How are the men shaping up?

19:48.248 --> 19:49.970
All two of them?

19:50.070 --> 19:52.205
The rest of the company
comes in today from main side.

19:52.305 --> 19:54.707
They'll be pretty green, gunny.

19:54.807 --> 19:57.176
Don't worry sir.
I'll take care of that.

19:57.276 --> 19:58.978
Well, you haven't got much time.

19:59.078 --> 20:02.747
Your enlistment runs out in... July.

20:05.350 --> 20:07.352
I've been in eight years-

20:07.452 --> 20:10.321
Four with the doggies,

20:10.421 --> 20:12.421
Four in the corps.

20:13.423 --> 20:15.423
I understand.

20:17.827 --> 20:19.929
Get across that water.

20:20.029 --> 20:22.029
Get up that tower.

20:24.134 --> 20:26.669
Go. - Get off my wall, marine.
Get off.

20:26.769 --> 20:28.769
One more time.

20:30.037 --> 20:32.037
Up that cargo net. Now.

20:32.706 --> 20:34.706
Keep moving, boy.

20:38.242 --> 20:40.242
What is this, a mob?.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.131
In formation,
two ranks behind me.

20:45.148 --> 20:46.649
Oh, come on.
Move your ass.

20:46.749 --> 20:48.749
Let's go.
All right.

20:54.723 --> 20:58.548
Okay, that's the last of the butter.
- 26 Ibs.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.862
Private Dowling, grab a hand truck
and get those sacks of rice.

21:03.962 --> 21:07.022
Got it?
- Grab those from the bottom.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.908
All perishables go in the reefer.

21:13.008 --> 21:15.008
All right.

21:15.543 --> 21:17.543
Sergeant Riggi.

21:18.813 --> 21:20.480
Gunny Basilone.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.385
This may not be appropriate, but-

21:23.451 --> 21:25.451
Hold on.

21:26.820 --> 21:29.255
Just a couple more and we'll
have all this cleared out.

21:29.355 --> 21:32.157
Uh, I would be happy

21:32.257 --> 21:34.793
If you would allow me to take
you out for a proper dinner.

21:34.893 --> 21:38.395
When?
- Friday night,

21:38.495 --> 21:40.296
A place I know just off the base-

21:40.396 --> 21:42.565
A restaurant.
- Clancy's?

21:42.665 --> 21:47.335
So you know it too.
- Nice place, but no.

21:54.876 --> 21:56.977
Friday's no good for me.

21:57.077 --> 21:59.313
I have orders-

21:59.413 --> 22:01.048
A big banquet for the officers.

22:01.148 --> 22:05.051
Maybe some other time?
- How about breakfast?

22:05.151 --> 22:07.487
Tomorrow morning.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.622
The k. P. Reports 0530.

22:09.722 --> 22:11.424
I show 0500.

22:11.524 --> 22:15.944
Show up a little earlier,
I'll make you French toast.

22:23.565 --> 22:25.533
Every marine out of those
racks and on my deck.

22:25.633 --> 22:27.001
Get your ass up.

22:27.101 --> 22:28.702
You've got five seconds.

22:28.802 --> 22:31.171
Five seconds.
Up up.

22:31.271 --> 22:33.072
Let's go.
- Move your ass.

22:33.172 --> 22:35.941
Get up. Move.

22:36.041 --> 22:38.410
Don't you eyeball me.
You stand at attention.

22:38.510 --> 22:40.612
And how come we're the only
ones running like this?

22:40.712 --> 22:43.147
Every damn morning.
- To make us the best.

22:43.247 --> 22:45.883
Oh, shut up.
I'm so sick of this shit.

22:45.983 --> 22:49.723
I just want to get out there and slap a Jap.

22:53.591 --> 22:55.159
What did you say?

22:55.259 --> 22:58.761
I said I want to slap a Jap, gunny.

23:03.365 --> 23:05.398
'slap a Jap'?

23:06.733 --> 23:08.238
Well, how about it, boys?

23:08.338 --> 23:11.174
I bet you all want
to do more than slap a Jap.

23:11.274 --> 23:14.061
Yes, gunny.

23:14.161 --> 23:16.212
'Slap a Jap. '

23:20.387 --> 23:23.532
That's what the enemy is to you, huh?

23:23.958 --> 23:26.492
A fucking bucktoothed cartoon dreamed up

23:26.592 --> 23:30.502
by some asshole on Madison
Avenue to sell soap.

23:30.961 --> 23:32.730
Well, let me tell you something.

23:32.830 --> 23:35.298
The Jap I know,

23:35.398 --> 23:37.834
The Japanese soldier,

23:37.934 --> 23:39.934
He has been at war

23:40.003 --> 23:43.540
Since you were in fucking diapers.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.042
He's a combat veteran,

23:45.142 --> 23:47.377
An expert with his weapon.

23:47.477 --> 23:50.213
He can live off of maggoty rice

23:50.313 --> 23:52.882
And muddy water for weeks and endure misery

23:52.982 --> 23:56.807
You couldn't dream up
in your worst nightmare.

23:57.886 --> 24:00.855
The Japanese soldier doesn't
care if he gets hurt or killed,

24:00.955 --> 24:03.723
As long as he kills you.

24:04.992 --> 24:07.460
Now you can call them whatever you want,

24:07.560 --> 24:11.196
But never, ever fail

24:11.296 --> 24:15.900
To respect their desire to put you
and buddies into an early grave.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.236
Is that clear?
- Yes, gunny.

24:19.336 --> 24:21.170
Why aren't you in your full packs?

24:21.270 --> 24:22.705
Gear up.

24:22.805 --> 24:26.542
10-mile run in formation

24:26.642 --> 24:29.610
In two minutes.

24:52.963 --> 24:55.003
You're gonna enjoy this.

24:56.534 --> 24:58.534
Almost ready.

25:04.641 --> 25:06.443
Pretty fancy for 0500.

25:06.543 --> 25:10.280
You strike me as an Italian mama's boy,

25:10.380 --> 25:13.749
Worshipped and pampered
just like my brothers.

25:13.849 --> 25:16.383
I wanted to make you feel at home.

25:16.483 --> 25:19.652
Well... I was told

25:19.752 --> 25:21.487
At a very early age I was the best thing

25:21.587 --> 25:24.456
Since sliced capicola.

25:24.556 --> 25:26.525
And there's enough for seconds.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.493
You'll want seconds.
- This is good.

25:28.593 --> 25:31.762
When I first got
here, the coffee was dreadful.

25:31.862 --> 25:34.431
How a marine mess can serve
bad coffee is beyond me.

25:34.531 --> 25:36.600
I can't live without it.

25:36.700 --> 25:39.970
The best coffee I ever
had was on Guadalcanal

25:40.070 --> 25:41.738
The morning after the battle.

25:41.838 --> 25:44.643
I know the story.
- Not this part.

25:45.274 --> 25:48.010
We stole some coffee from the
doggies when they came ashore.

25:48.110 --> 25:50.111
Liberated some hooch
from their officers too.

25:50.211 --> 25:52.847
Anyway, the morning after the battle,

25:52.947 --> 25:55.983
My guys cooked up the coffee over
a fire of green coconut logs.

25:56.083 --> 25:58.118
There wasn't any part
of me that didn't hurt-

25:58.218 --> 26:00.586
Burns on my hands,

26:01.654 --> 26:04.799
Ears still ringing from the shelling.

26:05.458 --> 26:08.660
But when they handed me that cup of coffee,

26:08.760 --> 26:10.728
I never tasted anything so good.

26:10.828 --> 26:13.633
Not that I don't appreciate this.

26:15.399 --> 26:19.139
What was the best cup
of coffee you ever had?

26:20.738 --> 26:24.241
My parents were real traditional.

26:24.341 --> 26:28.043
I was supposed to get married
and give them grandkids.

26:28.143 --> 26:31.711
So when I announced
that I'd joined the marines,

26:31.811 --> 26:34.146
There was a lot of yelling and crying

26:34.246 --> 26:38.015
And finally my father
just stopped talking to me,

26:38.115 --> 26:41.618
Cut me out of t family.

26:41.718 --> 26:45.421
A year later I got my stripes.
I went home to see my mom, my brothers.

26:45.521 --> 26:48.489
I was sitting in this diner

26:48.589 --> 26:49.991
And my pop walked in,

26:50.091 --> 26:53.999
Sat down beside me.
He ordered two cups of coffee

26:54.099 --> 26:58.435
And he put the milk and one sugar in for me.

27:00.338 --> 27:02.803
That was the best I ever had.

27:07.044 --> 27:11.464
It's incredible what can
happen over a cup of coffee.

27:15.818 --> 27:18.113
My enlistment's up in July.

27:19.922 --> 27:21.890
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

27:21.990 --> 27:26.580
You're gonna take a discharge
and you're gonna go home.

27:28.463 --> 27:30.898
I should be looking forward to my freedom,

27:30.998 --> 27:33.801
But I can't imagine it.

27:33.901 --> 27:35.902
I love the marines.

27:36.002 --> 27:39.605
You do too.
I love everything about it.

27:39.705 --> 27:44.210
I can't imagine being anywhere
or doing anything else.

27:48.847 --> 27:51.381
Lena.
- Yeah?

27:53.451 --> 27:55.552
You might hear this all the time,

27:55.652 --> 27:59.902
But you're the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

28:03.392 --> 28:05.392
No.

28:05.460 --> 28:08.263
I don't hear that very often.

28:08.363 --> 28:10.831
Must be the uniform.

28:12.033 --> 28:15.202
I could use a coffee.

28:17.436 --> 28:20.270
Shh, she's with the movie star.
- Interesting.

28:20.370 --> 28:22.006
Yeah.
- Look at gunny.

28:22.106 --> 28:24.271
A little early morning.

28:38.514 --> 28:40.215
Clear.
- Clear.

28:40.315 --> 28:42.525
Tatum, Evanson, set it up.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.051
Two short bursts, 85 rounds.

28:49.889 --> 28:51.891
Ready.
Gun set.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.991
Fire.

28:57.929 --> 28:59.996
That's good.

29:00.096 --> 29:02.298
Nice.

29:02.398 --> 29:05.133
Listen up.

29:06.402 --> 29:08.402
This is a bale.

29:08.453 --> 29:12.073
It'll make it easier to carry
the gun with a hot barrel.

29:12.173 --> 29:14.809
You won't burn your hands.

29:14.909 --> 29:17.112
Now it's not made for its
stability and accuracy

29:17.212 --> 29:20.015
But if you're in a pinch,

29:20.115 --> 29:23.217
You can shoot and move with this.

29:23.317 --> 29:25.385
Let me show you.

29:36.427 --> 29:40.592
I couldn't hit the side
of a barn with that thing.

29:44.100 --> 29:47.135
You'd better start practicing.

29:47.235 --> 29:49.235
Yeah.

29:53.174 --> 29:54.975
It's gorgeous.

29:55.075 --> 29:57.144
Come on, let's go in the water. - No.

29:57.244 --> 29:59.846
Come on, come on.
- No, I'm not going in that water.

29:59.946 --> 30:01.281
Come on.
- No way.

30:01.381 --> 30:04.050
No.
- I'll get you.

30:04.150 --> 30:06.686
I'm not gonna have you drown.

30:06.786 --> 30:10.390
No, put me down.

30:10.490 --> 30:11.925
Put me down.
- We're going in.

30:12.025 --> 30:14.960
No.
oh, my hat.

30:15.828 --> 30:17.229
My hat.
My-

30:17.329 --> 30:19.363
I'll get it.

30:21.966 --> 30:24.267
John, you're crazy.

30:25.970 --> 30:28.708
Ah.

30:31.344 --> 30:33.412
I got it.

30:44.722 --> 30:47.457
Oh no.
Oh no, you don't.

30:47.557 --> 30:50.226
Don't you dare.

31:24.618 --> 31:26.618
Attention on deck.

31:30.622 --> 31:33.023
Stand easy.

31:36.527 --> 31:40.030
Gentlemen, the 5th division
will ship out very soon

31:40.130 --> 31:43.615
For action in the Pacific theater of war.

31:43.708 --> 31:46.669
We won't know our destination
until we're well underway.

31:46.769 --> 31:49.571
But wherever we go,

31:49.671 --> 31:52.106
We will see the job through.

31:53.608 --> 31:55.809
Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.749
I have some more good news.

32:02.849 --> 32:05.117
Gunnery sergeant John Basilone

32:05.217 --> 32:07.852
Has decided that home can wait.

32:09.087 --> 32:12.255
He will be joining us.

32:14.024 --> 32:15.525
Carry on, gunny.

32:15.625 --> 32:17.625
Atten-hut.

32:21.633 --> 32:23.633
At ease.

32:26.642 --> 32:29.477
So is anybody scared?
- No, sir.

32:29.577 --> 32:33.681
I said is anybody scared?
- No, sergeant.

32:35.217 --> 32:37.486
You lying sacks of shit.

32:39.356 --> 32:41.357
It's good to be scared.

32:41.457 --> 32:44.160
It means you're awake,

32:44.260 --> 32:46.428
You're ready.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.534
Company dismissed.

32:57.505 --> 32:59.539
You ready?
You scared?

33:15.021 --> 33:17.589
It's not ready yet.
- Oh, okay.

33:17.689 --> 33:20.358
Can I have a bowl this time?

33:28.134 --> 33:31.402
She's back there. Lena?

33:37.606 --> 33:39.940
Hey.
- Hey to you.

33:41.475 --> 33:43.109
Out with it.

33:43.209 --> 33:45.811
Out with what?
- Whatever grim tidings

33:45.911 --> 33:49.736
You men carry around
with you like rock sacks.

34:06.394 --> 34:09.262
I've shipped over.

34:09.362 --> 34:11.431
I've re-enlisted.

34:11.531 --> 34:13.733
I see.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.702
They can ship me out whenever they want.

34:16.802 --> 34:20.202
So if you're looking for something else,

34:20.270 --> 34:22.707
Somebody in a different line of work,

34:22.807 --> 34:26.043
Tell me now.

34:26.143 --> 34:27.977
That sounds like an ultimatum.

34:28.077 --> 34:30.646
I'm just saying-
- Look.

34:30.746 --> 34:34.250
I'm in for the duration plus six months.

34:34.350 --> 34:37.318
I know how it goes, sergeant.

34:39.922 --> 34:41.922
So?

34:41.990 --> 34:44.124
Where do we go from here?

34:46.894 --> 34:48.361
Congratulations.

34:48.461 --> 34:51.351
Stay there.
I'm gonna take a photo.

34:55.332 --> 34:56.966
You look so beautiful.

34:57.066 --> 34:59.001
Lucy, let me get a shot.

34:59.101 --> 35:00.670
No, you stay there.
I want to take it.

35:00.770 --> 35:02.639
No, I want a shot of Lena
alone in that dress.

35:02.739 --> 35:05.142
Look here, darling.
Try not to blush.

35:05.242 --> 35:07.512
I feel like a paratrooper.

35:07.612 --> 35:10.448
I don't know why I wore this dress.
- You look beautiful.

35:10.548 --> 35:12.849
Be-au-ti-ful.

35:15.552 --> 35:20.482
Okay, John, go pose with your wife.
Let's make it official.

35:20.553 --> 35:22.358
Whoo.

35:22.458 --> 35:25.027
Now kiss her like you mean it.

35:25.127 --> 35:27.728
I can do that.

36:21.107 --> 36:23.708
Don't you touch me.

36:40.588 --> 36:42.056
Hold it.
Wait.

36:42.156 --> 36:44.156
What?

36:44.207 --> 36:46.425
Go stand over there.

37:01.139 --> 37:03.407
Take your clothes off.

37:03.507 --> 37:05.642
What?

37:07.344 --> 37:09.445
Do it.

38:29.905 --> 38:33.975
John, what have we done?

38:34.075 --> 38:36.710
We've gone respectable.

38:40.147 --> 38:41.781
You know...

38:41.881 --> 38:43.683
I woke up one day

38:43.783 --> 38:45.783
And I was 30 years old.

38:45.868 --> 38:48.088
Satisfied.

38:48.188 --> 38:50.908
Then you walk into my mess hall,

38:50.999 --> 38:52.759
And look at me now.

38:52.859 --> 38:54.360
Just wait and see.

38:54.460 --> 38:58.625
We're gonna have six kids.
- That's a lot of kids.

38:59.532 --> 39:03.017
You should have come around 10 years ago.

39:08.673 --> 39:10.941
Little boys for you to pamper,

39:11.041 --> 39:14.356
And little girls for me to drive crazy.

39:18.715 --> 39:21.283
I'd like that so much.

39:23.753 --> 39:27.153
This is yours now.
I want you to wear it.

39:57.713 --> 40:00.548
You want some food?
- Dear God, yes.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.368
Let me see what I can rustle up.

40:19.364 --> 40:21.431
What?

41:19.616 --> 41:22.985
Look at me.
I said look at me.

41:25.188 --> 41:28.624
You want to live?
Get off the beach.

41:28.724 --> 41:30.492
Move.

41:30.592 --> 41:32.659
Help, help me.

41:35.428 --> 41:37.496
Help me.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.891
Corpsman.
I need a corpsman.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.300
Move it back.

41:51.212 --> 41:54.181
Get off the beach.
Keep moving.

41:56.050 --> 41:57.652
Keep moving.

41:57.752 --> 41:59.354
Don't stop.

41:59.454 --> 42:00.922
Keep moving.

42:01.022 --> 42:03.572
Get off the beach.
Keep moving.

42:06.894 --> 42:08.628
Off the beach.
Get up.

42:08.728 --> 42:10.797
Move.

42:11.734 --> 42:14.102
Someone help me.

42:14.202 --> 42:15.937
Help him back.

42:16.037 --> 42:19.182
Off the beach.
Off the beach, get off.

42:22.241 --> 42:24.809
Evanson, Tatum, let's go.

42:26.545 --> 42:30.540
Get the fuck off the beach,
you sons-of-bitches.

43:05.915 --> 43:08.050
Set that fucker up here.

43:08.150 --> 43:10.150
Move.

43:18.559 --> 43:21.328
We gotta kill the bunker.
Get me a rabbit team.

43:21.428 --> 43:23.029
Get your charges ready to move.

43:23.129 --> 43:24.730
Captain, up here.

43:24.830 --> 43:27.233
Aim for the gun port.

43:27.333 --> 43:29.333
Short bursts.

43:32.405 --> 43:34.739
Go go.

43:37.777 --> 43:40.045
Keep firing.

43:52.525 --> 43:54.826
It's jammed.

44:13.376 --> 44:15.077
Pegg.

44:15.177 --> 44:17.478
All right, gunny.

44:21.048 --> 44:23.983
Go, move forward.

44:25.886 --> 44:27.886
Further up.

44:29.321 --> 44:31.321
Here.

44:33.658 --> 44:35.658
Let's go.

44:36.894 --> 44:38.894
Go go go go go.

44:54.179 --> 44:56.179
Fire in the hole.

44:56.982 --> 44:58.183
Let's go, let's go.

44:58.283 --> 45:00.085
Get in, get it.
- On me.

45:00.185 --> 45:02.185
Flamethrower u

45:29.546 --> 45:31.814
Move.

45:32.849 --> 45:34.849
Go go.
- Come on.

46:00.909 --> 46:02.909
Tatum.

46:19.792 --> 46:23.617
Take out that machine gun
and set up position.

46:24.029 --> 46:27.096
Tatum, clear the back line.

46:32.633 --> 46:35.534
Hold your fire.
Go go go.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.844
Stay low, stay low.

47:09.732 --> 47:11.933
Those are ours.

47:14.337 --> 47:16.572
Tatum, set the gun up there.

47:16.672 --> 47:18.273
They're firing for the Ridge.

47:18.373 --> 47:20.242
Go go.
Move move move.

47:20.342 --> 47:22.807
Down low.
Steve, Steve, lower.

47:23.979 --> 47:26.547
Do not leave this position
come hell or high water.

47:26.647 --> 47:29.582
Do you understand?
- Aye, gunny.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.860
You tell that tank to follow me.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.295
Aye aye.
- Move.

48:19.395 --> 48:21.395
Let's go.

48:21.463 --> 48:23.800
The rest of you, grab as
much ammo as you can find

48:23.900 --> 48:26.869
And get off the beach.
- Aye, gunny

48:38.246 --> 48:40.714
We're fucked.
What are we gonna do?

48:40.814 --> 48:42.814
Get that gun over here.

48:47.417 --> 48:48.984
Move.
- Get down.

48:49.084 --> 48:51.451
Go.
