You know she likes easy prey.

Wow. You really are easy to drag off.

06:20.149 --> 06:23.443
Don't worry, Gran. We'll
feed you and clean you,

06:23.527 --> 06:27.218
like an animal we catch
but never eat. It'll be fun.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.831
Eh, all right. Let's go. The
sooner we get to your cave,

07:18.166 --> 07:20.188
You know what? That's okay.

07:20.189 --> 07:24.808
- I've got to get to the hunt, anyway.
- About that. Now that we

07:24.809 --> 07:26.980
- have another mouth to feed...
- Huh?

07:28.676 --> 07:31.846
How much more food could you
bring home from the hunt today?

07:43.891 --> 07:47.978
Ugga, no. [mutters] All right,
let me explain how hunting works.

and you have bonkers.</i>

07:53.344 --> 07:56.180
Oh, no! I'm weak and helpless!

07:57.306 --> 08:01.519
Guess I'll just rub these berries
on myself while I wait to die.

08:03.521 --> 08:06.774
<i>[screams]
Bonkers bonk the food.</i>

08:08.776 --> 08:11.467
<i>[groans]
And sometimes the bait.</i>

08:13.572 --> 08:15.324
Good hustle, guys.

08:15.407 --> 08:18.056
<i>Every hunter starts out as bait,</i>

08:18.057 --> 08:20.705
<i>and yes, bait takes home more food.</i>

08:20.830 --> 08:23.290
Oh, no, I am weak and delicious.

08:23.374 --> 08:25.959
[creature bellows]
[groans, whimpers]

08:26.043 --> 08:29.171
<i>But keep in mind that... and I
can't stress this enough, honey...</i>

08:29.254 --> 08:31.841
Oh, no, I'm weak and...

08:31.923 --> 08:33.551
Aw, just eat me.

08:34.176 --> 08:36.470
<i>...you also have to be bait.</i>

08:36.774 --> 08:38.943
So, when I became a bonker,

08:39.025 --> 08:41.779
a good bonker, mind you, some
would say the best bonker,

08:41.861 --> 08:44.698
I promised myself that I
would never be bait again.

08:44.782 --> 08:48.452
And I promised myself I would never
share a cave with my mom again,

08:48.535 --> 08:51.705
but we all need to make
sacrifices now that she's here.

08:51.789 --> 08:55.542
Like, I need to gather more food,
and Eep has to watch Sandy and Thunk.

08:55.626 --> 08:59.046
- Wait, what?
- Hang out with Eep? All right!

08:59.129 --> 09:02.549

your brother and sister.

09:22.987 --> 09:26.657

She can't live forever.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.315
Oh, she might.
Gran is a force of nature.

last meal, but it never is.

pick, but never shares it.

but I promise, if you let us in,
they won't be embarrassing.

12:09.372 --> 12:10.373
Anymore.

12:10.456 --> 12:13.543
They'll just stand off to
the side and do nothing.

12:15.545 --> 12:18.631
You can come in, but they can't.

12:18.715 --> 12:21.592
That's just how it is.
I don't make the rules.

12:21.676 --> 12:25.763
- Yeah, we do!
- Oh, yeah, we do. Ha!

12:25.847 --> 12:30.851
Fine. We'll go make our own fun.
What do you kids want to do first?

12:30.852 --> 12:35.398
- Go ramu tipping or moon the sun?
- Let's moon the sun!

12:35.481 --> 12:37.984
Eep, you in or you out?

12:44.365 --> 12:46.158
I'm out.
[all gasp]

12:53.332 --> 12:58.671
<i>♪ Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah ♪</i>

12:58.755 --> 13:01.758
- Stop singing!
- Sorry.

13:03.133 --> 13:06.387
Is this safe, Gran? Dad
says, "When in doubt, don't.

13:06.470 --> 13:10.098
- Just... just don't."
- [scoffs] Your dad doesn't know fun.

13:10.182 --> 13:13.937
I do. Literally. I knew the
caveman who invented fun.

13:14.020 --> 13:18.148
- Really? Where is he now?
- Oh, he's dead. Now, cue the mask!

13:18.983 --> 13:20.068
[all roar]

13:20.150 --> 13:24.072
[creatures bellow]

13:24.614 --> 13:26.616
Stampede surfin'!

13:27.992 --> 13:30.078
Whoo!

13:30.736 --> 13:33.864
Great baiting today, Grug.
You're a natural.

13:33.948 --> 13:36.159
[groans]

13:36.242 --> 13:37.660
Mighty fine baiting, Grug.

13:37.743 --> 13:40.746
Way to make yourself look so
weak and pathetic. [chuckles]

13:40.830 --> 13:43.499
Really sold the whole
"giving up on life" thing.

13:43.582 --> 13:46.710
Yep, you are definitely our
bait from here on out, Grug.

13:46.794 --> 13:50.965
You know, until you...
[imitates choking] "Ahh!"

13:51.048 --> 13:56.137
Today, I was bonked, bitten,
bruised, battered, and bashed.

13:56.220 --> 13:59.890
And I'd rather go through all of
that again than go home to Gran.

13:59.974 --> 14:02.977
Be grateful for the
family you have, Grug.

14:02.978 --> 14:04.979
Remember, I lost mine.

14:07.148 --> 14:10.985
Still no idea where you left them, huh?
We really should search more.

14:11.068 --> 14:13.904
Ha! Yeah, and lose myself, too?
No, thank you.

14:14.322 --> 14:18.659
If Gran just had somewhere else to go,
but we're the only family she's got.

14:18.742 --> 14:22.411
Not like I can find her a new family...
[cheering and laughter]

14:24.915 --> 14:28.836
Whoo! Ha-ha!
Look what Gran taught us.

14:28.919 --> 14:30.213
[Thunk laughs]

14:30.296 --> 14:31.547
Whoo! Hey!

14:31.630 --> 14:35.592
Nice pelt, Grog.
Does it come in "cave men's"?

14:35.676 --> 14:36.677
[Gran laughs]

14:37.427 --> 14:40.981
Know what? I think I will
try finding you a new family.

14:40.982 --> 14:44.797
- Anyone need a grandma?
- I do.

14:44.832 --> 14:46.312
<i>Bye, Grug. Bye, new grandma.</i>

14:46.395 --> 14:50.316
Go ahead. You think I like
living with you, Grunk?

14:50.399 --> 14:53.277
It's Grug!
Oof!

14:53.944 --> 14:56.989
Wait. You don't want to live with us?

14:57.073 --> 15:01.744
No. You're loud, you're obnoxious,
and you always tell me what to do.

15:01.827 --> 15:04.997
No, no, those are my
complaints about you.

15:05.081 --> 15:09.335
I had it good. Sure, all kinds
of critters tried to eat me,

15:09.418 --> 15:12.504
but none of them ever
called me embarrassing.

15:12.588 --> 15:15.758
The only one who wants
me living with you is...

15:15.841 --> 15:17.467
<i>[both] Ugga.</i>

15:20.212 --> 15:25.342
So, we need to convince her that
I can still take care of myself.

15:25.426 --> 15:27.553
That's pretty hard to do when
every time you come to visit,

15:27.636 --> 15:30.055
it's in the mouth of another bear owl.

15:30.847 --> 15:34.059
[gasps] You big, dumb idiot.

15:34.143 --> 15:35.769
You're a genius, Grug!

15:35.852 --> 15:39.148
It's Grug!
Oh, you said it right that time.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.404
Yeah.

15:45.488 --> 15:50.117
All right! Hanging with
the "in crowd." [chuckles]

15:50.200 --> 15:53.036
You know, I've always wondered
what you guys do in here.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.748
- You're looking at it.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

15:56.832 --> 15:59.042
And you do it really well.

15:59.126 --> 16:03.797
Uh, but what do you do for fun?
I mean, I bet it's awesome, like...

16:04.590 --> 16:06.008
What if we jump off cliffs?

16:06.091 --> 16:10.971
No way! What if we fell wrong?
We'd look stupid!

16:12.181 --> 16:14.224
Okay. Uh...

16:14.308 --> 16:17.019
Look, Eep, now that
you're in the "in crowd,"

16:17.102 --> 16:20.189
you can't do anything that
might make you look uncool.

16:20.272 --> 16:23.192
Or trying too hard. Or trying at all.

16:23.275 --> 16:28.531
- So, that means we do nothing?
- She gets it.

16:30.616 --> 16:31.450
[gasps]

16:38.290 --> 16:40.626
[both grunt]

16:41.835 --> 16:44.129
Hey, guys, need a hand?

16:44.212 --> 16:47.633
- Sandy, do you hear something?
- Huh-uh.

16:47.716 --> 16:51.720
Look, about earlier... I said
some things, you said some things.

16:51.804 --> 16:56.725
Sounds like Eep, but she'd never
be here because we embarrass her.

16:57.309 --> 17:02.856
Yeah, but it turns out that
embarrassing is a whole lot more fun.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.650
Huh. So, what are we doing here?

17:10.113 --> 17:12.491
So, we just roll down?

17:13.492 --> 17:14.867
This is getting faster.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.368
Whoa! [laughs]

17:16.453 --> 17:19.204

[all cheer]

17:24.294 --> 17:25.878
[Gran cackles]

17:25.963 --> 17:29.508
This is your plan?
Who's even going to wear this?

17:29.591 --> 17:30.509
Huh?

17:33.512 --> 17:35.305
[kids laugh]

17:35.388 --> 17:40.310
Looks like you kids are having fun.
Who wants to have more fun?

17:41.854 --> 17:45.064
I do... if I don't
embarrass you too much.

17:45.148 --> 17:50.445
Oh, all family's embarrassing,
but we'll always be together.

17:50.529 --> 17:53.699
Now, help me trick your
mom so I can live on my own.

I hate saying this, but help me!

Get away from that big, dumb animal,
you even bigger, dumb animal.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.239
Hee-yah! Ha!

18:34.322 --> 18:37.367
Look at me taking care
of myself and then some!

18:37.450 --> 18:39.661
[Gran growls, grunts]

18:41.287 --> 18:44.833
So, we're pretending. Okay!

18:44.917 --> 18:46.585
More family fun.
[all gasp]

18:46.668 --> 18:48.003
Who should I be?

18:48.503 --> 18:50.618

18:50.653 --> 18:53.675
Eh, how about I pretend
to be a hunter instead?

18:53.759 --> 18:56.762
Let go of my handsome hubby,
you beast! [bear owl snarls]

18:56.845 --> 18:58.847

So... not ticklish?

19:39.637 --> 19:41.973
Oh. You do?

19:42.057 --> 19:44.809
Well, if you want to eat
this big, brave idiot,

19:44.893 --> 19:48.271
you've got to eat through
my tough old hide first.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.315
[roars]

19:50.398 --> 19:53.526
And if you want to eat her,
you have to eat me?

you've got to eat all the Croods!

Um, I appreciate all the love,
but how about it eats none of us?

stupid, but also awesome.

Should we start doing
stuff? Tell me, Sulk.

know what's cool anymore.

21:40.425 --> 21:43.261
The system has failed us.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.098
Guess that's it for the "in crowd."

21:47.181 --> 21:50.309
Hmm, good thing I'm running
with a much cooler crowd now.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.562
Oh, yeah? Who?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.356
Our family.
We are the cooler crowd.

Whoo-hoo!

21:58.943 --> 22:04.198
Normally, I say "don't" to anything
new, but just this once, I'll say "do."

Do move into our cave,
