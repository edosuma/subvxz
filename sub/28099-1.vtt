<i>Oh, too heavy.</i>

00:45.039 --> 00:50.076
<i>I need you.
No, no!</i>

01:29.454 --> 01:30.554
God bless you.

02:36.726 --> 02:38.193
Yeah!

04:52.939 --> 04:55.409
The day won't go away, Mommy.

04:55.411 --> 04:58.378
Grandpa said you have
to be ready at 8.

04:58.380 --> 04:59.680
Okay.

05:14.998 --> 05:17.468
Okay, I'm getting up.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.502
- Come on.
- Alright.

05:21.504 --> 05:24.906
We can't be late
and you can't be fat.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.541
I'm not fat.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.678
Not yet.

05:28.713 --> 05:31.614
- I'll go get your clothes.
- Okay.

05:56.676 --> 05:58.477
I'm gonna make you lunch.

05:58.479 --> 05:59.578
<i>Done.</i>

05:59.580 --> 06:00.678
<i>Homework done.</i>

06:00.680 --> 06:03.450
Teeth, face, hair,
done.

06:04.385 --> 06:06.487
- Thanks.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

06:43.627 --> 06:45.629
<i>What are you
doing with those thugs?</i>

06:52.670 --> 06:54.741
<i>I know what tomorrow is.</i>

06:58.109 --> 07:00.510
It's been a tough year for you.

07:00.512 --> 07:03.813
<i>But at some point,
you have to stop this.</i>

07:09.122 --> 07:11.622
Tomorrow,
come to the church.

07:11.624 --> 07:14.459
I'm not going to that church.

07:14.461 --> 07:16.629
The bank called.

07:17.998 --> 07:19.931
<i>Your reference.</i>

07:19.933 --> 07:23.000
<i>Ninety days behind, Laura.</i>

07:23.002 --> 07:26.003
<i>You don't want to
lose this place, do you?</i>

07:26.005 --> 07:29.508
It's one of the few stable
things in Kate's life.

07:29.510 --> 07:30.710
Kate is fine.

07:30.712 --> 07:31.977
<i>No, she's not.</i>

07:34.215 --> 07:36.418
<i>And you should see that.</i>

07:39.487 --> 07:40.855
Open the door.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.508
<i>Papa!</i>

07:59.510 --> 08:02.676
<i>Ah, there's my sweetheart!</i>

08:04.114 --> 08:06.218
Oh, gosh.

08:07.918 --> 08:10.653
You look more and more
like your grandma did

08:10.655 --> 08:12.622
when she was your age.

08:12.624 --> 08:14.023
Beautiful!

08:14.025 --> 08:15.992
Are you still surprising
Mommy today?

08:15.994 --> 08:17.125
I am.

08:17.127 --> 08:19.195
You didn't spill the beans,
did you?

08:19.197 --> 08:22.633
Nope.
But it was so hard!

08:22.635 --> 08:26.135
Good, you know how your
mom is about surprises.

08:26.137 --> 08:27.005
Morning.

08:31.878 --> 08:35.783
Grumpy pants.

09:05.782 --> 09:07.949
Girl, this is really nice.

09:07.951 --> 09:09.349
It sure is.

09:09.351 --> 09:11.218
I can hardly wait till Sunday.

09:11.220 --> 09:12.286
Wonder how many
people will show up.

09:12.288 --> 09:13.653
<i>Probably a lot.</i>

09:13.655 --> 09:16.022
<i>And you know, they're doing
such a good job with our...</i>

09:25.936 --> 09:27.138
Copy that.

10:08.783 --> 10:10.586
So, here you go.

10:11.251 --> 10:12.718
You know the drill.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.685
I want you to go straight home

10:13.687 --> 10:16.725
and don't open the door
until I get there.

10:18.227 --> 10:20.797
Hey, something wrong?

10:21.764 --> 10:24.031
Daddy died today
one year ago.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.201
Yeah.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.035
I know.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.107
<i>Okay.</i>

10:32.409 --> 10:35.375
Can I just come to the
new church with you today?

10:35.377 --> 10:36.878
- No.
- Please?

10:36.880 --> 10:38.346
We talked about this,
remember?

10:38.348 --> 10:41.050
You can't miss any more
days of school.

10:45.022 --> 10:47.224
Hey, I got something for you.

11:01.105 --> 11:02.841
It's a bright color.

11:04.308 --> 11:06.277
And it's a bright day.

11:06.279 --> 11:08.179
Alright, kiddo.

11:08.181 --> 11:10.884
Go ahead. Get to class
before the bell rings.

11:16.989 --> 11:18.659
I love you.

12:10.081 --> 12:11.883
<i>Ugh.</i>

12:16.220 --> 12:19.121
There she is.
More beautiful than I remember.

12:19.123 --> 12:21.057
- Ah.
- Laura.

12:21.059 --> 12:23.092
Clarke.
You didn't tell her, did you?

12:23.094 --> 12:25.262
No, I didn't want to
spoil the surprise.

12:25.264 --> 12:27.364
Surprise? What surprise?

12:27.366 --> 12:29.166
Well, we won't keep you
waiting too long on it,

12:29.168 --> 12:31.067
but first,
I want you to meet Xander.

12:31.069 --> 12:33.804
Xander, Laura Bishop,
your new protégé.

12:33.806 --> 12:36.307
Former military,
former lawyer.

12:36.309 --> 12:38.375
Heck, she might've had
your job if she didn't quit.

12:38.377 --> 12:40.513
Shall we?

12:43.817 --> 12:46.818
I know. I'm fifteen
minutes behind schedule.

12:46.820 --> 12:48.886
Well, they can't start
without you.

12:48.888 --> 12:50.488
Well, no, they can't.

12:50.490 --> 12:52.123
Then you're on time.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.593
Ha! That's what
I'm talking about.

12:53.595 --> 12:54.593
What would I do
without you, Xander?

12:54.595 --> 12:56.362
I don't know.
You wouldn't be able to handle

12:56.364 --> 12:57.296
all this without me.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.233
That is true.

12:59.466 --> 13:01.601
Do me a favor.
Will you prep her while I, uh,

13:01.603 --> 13:03.368
get up to this deacons
meeting with Clarke?

13:03.370 --> 13:04.405
Yeah, sure.

13:05.841 --> 13:06.974
Yes, Reverend.

13:06.976 --> 13:07.878
That's better.

13:08.376 --> 13:09.844
Clarke, shall we?

13:09.846 --> 13:10.346
Sure.

13:11.213 --> 13:13.280
Do me a favor.
Will you run up ahead?

13:13.282 --> 13:15.315
I just gotta stop at
my office for a second.

13:15.317 --> 13:16.886
- Sure.
- Alright, thank you.

13:19.155 --> 13:20.621
<i>Started working on
security for the new building</i>

13:20.623 --> 13:21.558
<i>a month after you left.</i>

13:23.327 --> 13:26.327
They hired me to replace you so
I guess I should say thank you.

13:26.329 --> 13:28.833
No. You don't have
to thank me.

13:30.234 --> 13:32.567
Cameras in all directions,
two-way.

13:32.569 --> 13:34.537
That glass is bulletproof.

13:34.539 --> 13:36.809
All doors have automatic locks.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.512
You don't think it's
a bit much for a church?

13:45.184 --> 13:46.617
Memphis, Tennessee.

13:46.619 --> 13:48.551
Armed protestors
stormed a church.

13:48.553 --> 13:50.319
Virginia.
Two men were arrested

13:50.321 --> 13:52.421
for planning a mass attack
at their local church.

13:52.423 --> 13:54.093
South Carolina,
nine dead.

13:56.229 --> 13:57.565
Bottom line,

13:59.231 --> 14:00.900
it's all a bit much.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.003
Till it isn't.

14:20.488 --> 14:21.990
There's more?

14:33.335 --> 14:35.305
It's a subbasement.
Level three.

14:36.638 --> 14:40.173
Sanctuary's the heart.
This is the brain.

14:40.175 --> 14:41.376
In the event of
a natural disaster,

14:41.378 --> 14:45.112
this floor alone could house
up to five thousand people.

14:45.114 --> 14:46.618
Like a modern day ark.

14:48.384 --> 14:51.021
State flags represent
the church's reach.

14:52.255 --> 14:54.690
I'd like to have that wall
filled in a year.

14:54.692 --> 14:57.627
Well, a lot has changed
in the last year.

14:57.629 --> 14:59.264
Mark's been working hard.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.464
We all have.

15:15.380 --> 15:18.082
Jenny, Tank.
Meet Laura Bishop,

15:18.084 --> 15:20.485
our newest member,
Clarke's daughter.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.720
Hi, I'm Jenny.

15:21.722 --> 15:23.087
<i>What happened to your face?</i>

15:23.089 --> 15:25.023
Oh, Mike Tyson got lucky.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.692
She's got a sense of humor.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.295
<i>We're gonna get along
just fine. I'm Tank.</i>

15:30.297 --> 15:31.065
Nice to meet you.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.534
This is where you will
start your shift every day.

15:35.536 --> 15:39.005
You'll primarily have
exterior patrol.

15:39.007 --> 15:41.274
Fridays are the slow days.

15:41.276 --> 15:42.575
Tank, do me a favor.

15:42.577 --> 15:45.245
Get her personnel info
on file, please.

15:45.247 --> 15:46.582
I'll be outside.

15:54.657 --> 15:56.690
I was just telling, uh,
Rusty here about

15:56.692 --> 15:58.392
how glad we are that
this thing's finally

15:58.394 --> 16:00.294
about ready to get opened
here, you know?

16:00.296 --> 16:01.628
<i>It's about time.</i>

16:01.630 --> 16:04.431
Gentlemen, hope I didn't
keep you waiting too long.

16:04.433 --> 16:06.368
Punctuality is a virtue.

16:06.370 --> 16:08.170
- Reverend, very good to see you.
- Carl.

16:08.172 --> 16:09.571
What do you say?
What do you know?

16:09.573 --> 16:11.205
How you doin'?
Good.

16:11.207 --> 16:13.108
Better be seen than viewed,
young man.

16:13.110 --> 16:14.609
<i>How you doin', Rusty?</i>

16:14.611 --> 16:18.114
You old silver grey fox you.

16:18.116 --> 16:19.282
Oh, I'm excited.

16:19.284 --> 16:22.085
<i>Can you believe that
it's only three days out</i>

16:22.087 --> 16:24.156
till we open our new chapter?

16:25.290 --> 16:26.222
Let's get you back
top side.

16:26.224 --> 16:28.526
The deacons wanted
to have a word with you.

16:32.264 --> 16:33.631
Last thing.

16:33.633 --> 16:34.533
Room 139.

16:36.134 --> 16:38.369
This is where we house
the emergency exit.

16:38.371 --> 16:41.309
It's the only way out from this
floor if the elevators go down.

16:42.842 --> 16:45.309
This says, uh, "janitor".

16:45.311 --> 16:46.710
Yep, hidden in plain sight.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.118
Pray you never have to see it.

16:56.457 --> 16:57.456
Things have
come together nicely.

16:57.458 --> 16:58.624
Thank you.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.828
<i>I still do not
believe this move is...</i>

17:01.830 --> 17:02.698
necessary.

17:03.664 --> 17:05.566
<i>But, as you all know,</i>

17:05.568 --> 17:06.834
I got outvoted.

17:06.836 --> 17:09.303
Well, Rusty,
you're always slow to change.

17:09.305 --> 17:10.871
People have lost faith.

17:10.873 --> 17:12.739
<i>This building screams faith.</i>

17:12.741 --> 17:15.275
- Amen.
- Something to aspire to.

17:15.277 --> 17:16.643
Speaking of lost faith,

17:16.645 --> 17:18.480
guess who's back today?

17:27.223 --> 17:31.359
Hey, why are those guys
in military formation?

17:31.361 --> 17:33.297
Xander's training for
opening day.

17:34.599 --> 17:36.201
Hmm.

17:42.340 --> 17:44.110
<i>Laura, please take a seat.</i>

17:46.712 --> 17:48.481
Laura, these are new.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.183
<i>Small reference.</i>

17:52.317 --> 17:54.417
- <i>You should take it.</i>
- Hmm.

17:54.419 --> 17:56.186
<i>Laura I know you
don't like surprises,</i>

17:56.188 --> 17:59.389
so I'll just not keep you
waiting any longer.

17:59.391 --> 18:01.224
<i>I also know you haven't
been around the church much</i>

18:01.226 --> 18:02.894
<i>since you lost David.</i>

18:02.896 --> 18:04.494
<i>That is,</i>

18:04.496 --> 18:06.366
since David passed away.

18:07.634 --> 18:10.468
<i>And we all know how much
David loved the kids</i>

18:10.470 --> 18:12.803
<i>and dedicated to
the kids of the church.</i>

18:12.805 --> 18:14.842
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- So we decided...

18:16.410 --> 18:17.877
to honor David

18:17.879 --> 18:20.813
and dedicate the new wing

18:20.815 --> 18:22.482
to him.

18:28.289 --> 18:29.390
From this day forward,

18:29.392 --> 18:33.360
it'll be known as the
David A. Bishop Youth Wing.

18:40.803 --> 18:41.906
That's um...

18:42.838 --> 18:44.774
That's really kind of you all.

18:55.653 --> 18:57.489
Would you excuse me
for one minute?

19:07.532 --> 19:08.300
<i>It's okay.</i>

19:09.268 --> 19:12.001
She just needs time to process.

19:12.003 --> 19:14.003
Well, we can, uh,

19:14.005 --> 19:18.475
<i>proceed with our business and
return to this matter later.</i>

19:18.477 --> 19:19.679
That's a good idea, Carl.

19:20.647 --> 19:22.981
<i>If we could all open our books</i>

19:22.983 --> 19:24.848
and turn to page one.

20:17.909 --> 20:19.007
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

20:29.788 --> 20:31.523
Silver, Orange,
third floor.

20:32.724 --> 20:34.026
Yellow, Green,
second floor.

20:35.460 --> 20:36.863
<i>Blue, Red,
secure the conference room.</i>

21:24.614 --> 21:25.879
<i>Cell phones
won't work with this</i>

21:25.881 --> 21:28.148
<i>high-tech security
running through the ceilings.</i>

21:28.150 --> 21:30.586
<i>And because it's not due
to open for another 48 hours,</i>

21:30.588 --> 21:33.658
<i>any chance of help from
the outside is virtually zero.</i>

21:40.899 --> 21:43.766
<i>All floors locked down.
Cell signals are jammed.</i>

21:43.768 --> 21:45.570
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

21:46.470 --> 21:47.806
Let there be night.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.773
<i>Between 2014</i>

21:50.775 --> 21:53.444
and 2016
from our collection...

21:53.446 --> 21:54.678
<i>Oh, great.</i>

21:54.680 --> 21:56.580
<i>Reverend, what's
going on with your lights?</i>

21:56.582 --> 21:59.049
<i>I paid the
over-expensive light.</i>

21:59.051 --> 22:00.551
<i>What's going on?</i>

22:00.553 --> 22:02.786
One of the grunts
probably tripped a line.

22:02.788 --> 22:05.556
Security system's
still in tact, though.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.493
<i>It's on a different circuit.</i>

22:09.595 --> 22:11.595
Control, this is Alpha.
Trip back ups, please.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.497
<i>I need all doors unlocked.</i>

22:17.838 --> 22:19.807
Mark, get down.

22:20.842 --> 22:22.911
<i>Sarah!</i>

22:24.144 --> 22:25.977
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- <i>Stay there.</i>

22:25.979 --> 22:27.913
<i>Baby.
Go on, do something!</i>

22:27.915 --> 22:29.783
Baby, are you okay?

22:29.785 --> 22:31.919
Shaw, what is going on here?

22:31.921 --> 22:34.121
- <i>Baby.</i>
- <i>Guys,</i>

22:34.123 --> 22:35.721
<i>I need you in that corner.</i>

22:35.723 --> 22:37.493
Quickly, please, quickly.

22:41.897 --> 22:45.001
Xander, are we alright?

22:58.915 --> 23:00.050
Open the door.

23:01.184 --> 23:02.651
I don't know
what's going on here,

23:02.653 --> 23:04.122
but I'll let the police
deal with it.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.588
Were those gunshots?

23:35.289 --> 23:38.956
No. I know gunshots.

23:38.958 --> 23:41.596
<i>Those most definitely
were not gunshots.</i>

23:49.271 --> 23:50.970
Where are you going?

23:50.972 --> 23:52.608
This woman still got in here.

23:53.976 --> 23:55.743
You swept the whole place?

23:55.745 --> 23:57.110
Yeah, but she got past me.

23:57.112 --> 24:00.714
You better find her
before Black finds out.

24:00.716 --> 24:03.650
Come on, man, I got this.
Just check.

24:07.290 --> 24:08.692
Kate.

24:12.028 --> 24:13.163
Kate.

24:17.568 --> 24:18.103
Kate.

24:22.073 --> 24:23.242
Kate.

24:33.117 --> 24:34.351
I hope this doesn't
have anything to do

24:34.353 --> 24:36.022
with our new hire.

24:37.122 --> 24:38.055
Xander,

24:38.057 --> 24:41.225
I've always questioned
your intelligence.

24:41.227 --> 24:43.627
Thank you for
providing the answer.

24:43.629 --> 24:46.163
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Gentlemen, take it easy.

24:46.165 --> 24:49.200
Xander, do not
jump to conclusions.

24:49.202 --> 24:50.268
I can vouch for Laura.

24:50.270 --> 24:53.905
Clarke, we cannot afford
to turn on each other now.

24:53.907 --> 24:56.240
Just relax, please.

24:56.242 --> 24:59.310
Now, we have a system,
a protocol,

24:59.312 --> 25:03.015
and it is gonna be infallible,
right, Xander?

25:03.017 --> 25:04.854
It's the best money can buy.

25:08.189 --> 25:09.822
<i>Control, come in.</i>

25:09.824 --> 25:11.660
<i>Control, where are you?</i>

25:12.627 --> 25:14.193
Gentlemen.

25:14.195 --> 25:16.998
<i>I know your minds are
flooded with questions.</i>

25:17.000 --> 25:19.367
Questions that,
with patience, will subside,

25:19.369 --> 25:21.402
as I do not relish
in indecisiveness.

25:21.404 --> 25:23.803
<i>I don't know who
you are or what you want.</i>

25:23.805 --> 25:26.072
I'm Xander Worth.
I'm head of security.

25:26.074 --> 25:28.877
I know who you are, Mr. Worth,
and I know who you are not,

25:28.879 --> 25:30.177
<i>so spare me the macho rhetoric</i>

25:30.179 --> 25:32.214
<i>and understand
you are not in control</i>

25:32.216 --> 25:33.181
of anything.

25:33.183 --> 25:33.918
Sir.

25:34.885 --> 25:37.319
<i>My name is
Reverend Mark Shaw.</i>

25:37.321 --> 25:39.287
I'm the head of this church.

25:39.289 --> 25:41.657
<i>Now, y-you seem like
a reasonable man.</i>

25:41.659 --> 25:43.292
<i>Whatever it is you want,
just let me know,</i>

25:43.294 --> 25:45.028
and you and I can
work this out.

25:45.030 --> 25:47.897
And you, Reverend,
my favorite reverend,

25:47.899 --> 25:50.332
from the impoverished streets
of Memphis, Tennessee

25:50.334 --> 25:54.204
to the powerful pulpit
of Bethel Community Church.

25:54.206 --> 25:56.939
Listen, genius.
Reciting facts you can find

25:56.941 --> 25:58.876
on any online bio about this man

25:58.878 --> 26:01.712
doesn't exactly infuse us
with a sense of

26:01.714 --> 26:04.783
shock and awe that
I'm sure you were going for.

26:12.425 --> 26:15.025
<i>How's that for shock and awe?</i>

26:18.932 --> 26:20.932
Now that your mouths are closed
and your eyes are open,

26:20.934 --> 26:22.133
<i>we'll make this simple.</i>

26:22.135 --> 26:23.436
Sir, what is it that you want?

26:23.438 --> 26:28.407
Harming us will achieve nothing
but more hurt, more bloodshed.

26:28.409 --> 26:32.179
I'd like to come up with a
reasonable resolution with you.

26:32.181 --> 26:35.382
<i>One that we can all live with.</i>

26:38.052 --> 26:40.086
Reverend,
always with the silver...

26:40.088 --> 26:42.757
should I say, golden...
tongue.

26:42.759 --> 26:45.793
Ah, I believe that relationships
require a give and take

26:45.795 --> 26:47.828
as well as trust
to be fruitful.

26:47.830 --> 26:49.497
So given the abrupt
beginning to our relationship,

26:49.499 --> 26:52.033
let me start first by
offering some goodwill.

26:52.035 --> 26:53.004
How kind.

26:54.204 --> 26:56.003
I will allow
one person to leave.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.772
<i>They will be allowed to
wait in the delivery area</i>

26:57.774 --> 27:00.108
until our purpose here
is complete.

27:00.110 --> 27:03.746
When we leave,
they'll be allowed to leave.

27:03.748 --> 27:06.182
How do we know you
won't kill 'em once he's out?

27:06.184 --> 27:08.350
If you cooperate and
simply follow my rules,

27:08.352 --> 27:11.154
everyone will make it
outta here alive and well.

27:11.156 --> 27:11.889
If not,

27:13.058 --> 27:15.261
<i>well, you made that decision.</i>

27:16.194 --> 27:17.397
<i>Please confirm.</i>

27:18.196 --> 27:19.866
<i>You have one minute.</i>

27:22.167 --> 27:25.138
And oh, one person.

27:26.505 --> 27:27.873
Any more than that,

27:28.976 --> 27:31.111
and you will have
revoked my goodwill.

27:33.147 --> 27:35.946
<i>Oh, baby,
it's okay, it's okay.</i>

27:35.948 --> 27:37.515
<i>W-We're gonna get
you out of here.</i>

27:37.517 --> 27:39.352
<i>I promise,
we'll get you out of here.</i>

27:41.523 --> 27:42.791
Shaw,

27:43.557 --> 27:46.859
She leaves.
She goes.

27:46.861 --> 27:48.794
Yes, Carl,
that's a good idea.

27:48.796 --> 27:50.463
<i>Women and children
always go first.</i>

27:50.465 --> 27:52.533
There's no kids here.

27:52.535 --> 27:53.966
<i>Sh-she goes.</i>

27:53.968 --> 27:55.936
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, baby.

27:55.938 --> 27:58.138
<i>I'm gonna follow her out.</i>

27:58.140 --> 27:59.406
I'll duck behind her,

27:59.408 --> 28:01.307
by the time they see me,
I'll be all over 'em.

28:01.309 --> 28:02.575
<i>They're not gonna shoot her.</i>

28:02.577 --> 28:04.311
How do you know
they won't shoot her?

28:04.313 --> 28:06.346
And how do you know
how many are out there?

28:06.348 --> 28:08.149
<i>Easy, Clarke.</i>

28:08.151 --> 28:09.820
You said you heard a gun.

28:10.854 --> 28:12.320
There's two of them
down there.

28:12.322 --> 28:13.420
How many did you see?

28:13.422 --> 28:14.157
O-one.

28:15.357 --> 28:18.193
There might've been two,
but I only saw one.

28:18.195 --> 28:19.330
Right, she saw one.

28:21.065 --> 28:23.364
I don't think it's a good idea.

28:23.366 --> 28:24.600
It's not smart.

28:24.602 --> 28:27.239
What Clarke?
Your daughter's gonna save us?

28:28.840 --> 28:31.376
I have a plan.
I'll handle it.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.780
Why don't one of us go?

28:35.614 --> 28:38.217
<i>Just in case it
might be a ruse.</i>

28:56.904 --> 28:59.337
- <i>You ready?</i>
- Be careful.

28:59.339 --> 29:01.573
Come on,
let's get her out of here.

29:01.575 --> 29:02.410
Come on.

29:03.144 --> 29:04.444
<i>Are you sure?</i>

29:04.446 --> 29:06.311
I'm the head of security
for a reason.

29:07.415 --> 29:09.281
<i>It's gonna be alright.</i>

29:09.283 --> 29:12.251
Come on, it's gonna be okay.
Just keep your faith.

29:40.485 --> 29:41.219
Oh!

29:48.558 --> 29:50.959
W-What happened, Xander?

30:27.268 --> 30:28.337
Kate.

30:39.146 --> 30:40.250
Kate.

30:44.119 --> 30:45.088
Kate.

30:48.724 --> 30:50.059
Kate.

31:15.719 --> 31:17.556
Can I just come to the new
church with you today?

31:45.318 --> 31:46.752
Hold it.

31:48.389 --> 31:49.623
We're going downstairs.

31:52.393 --> 31:55.131
You let me find my little girl,

31:58.566 --> 32:00.002
I'll let you live.

32:20.191 --> 32:21.222
<i>Where's Sarah?</i>

32:21.224 --> 32:23.528
No, no, no, no!

32:27.631 --> 32:29.265
Calm down, old man.

32:29.267 --> 32:32.268
Alright, Xander,
get off of him. Relax.

32:32.270 --> 32:33.435
Relax, old fella.

32:33.437 --> 32:36.538
Rules.
Follow rules, Mr. Worth.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.141
<i>Are you one of those
"Do as I say,</i>

32:38.143 --> 32:40.078
<i>not as I do"
type of fellas?</i>

32:42.115 --> 32:43.847
You didn't have to kill her.

32:43.849 --> 32:45.415
You didn't have to
break my rule.

32:45.417 --> 32:46.819
She didn't.

32:47.720 --> 32:48.789
He did.

32:50.889 --> 32:52.723
I find the consequences
of one's sins is

32:52.725 --> 32:54.326
rarely borne by that person.

32:54.328 --> 32:56.560
It's really borne by
the people around them.

32:56.562 --> 32:58.497
And Mr. Worth's
sins of deception

32:58.499 --> 33:00.635
was felt by that poor woman.

33:02.836 --> 33:04.637
Well, since that was
an utter failure,

33:04.639 --> 33:06.371
let's proceed to do
what we must do

33:06.373 --> 33:08.209
<i>to leave here alive, hmm?</i>

33:09.811 --> 33:13.479
There's a laptop there,
under the table.

33:13.481 --> 33:14.679
<i>Please open it.</i>

33:14.681 --> 33:16.084
<i>Not you.</i>

33:16.718 --> 33:17.620
You.

33:19.655 --> 33:20.657
Me?

33:21.623 --> 33:23.256
<i>You are the treasurer and CFO</i>

33:23.258 --> 33:24.291
<i>and have access
to all the accounts.</i>

33:24.293 --> 33:25.659
<i>So you will transfer
all the funds</i>

33:25.661 --> 33:28.865
<i>to the bank account that is
open on the terminal page.</i>

33:40.210 --> 33:42.844
Wait... wait a minute.
He doesn't know how to do that!

33:42.846 --> 33:45.180
Yes, he does.

33:45.182 --> 33:48.417
<i>The bank account reads what,
gentlemen?</i>

33:51.956 --> 33:54.323
Ten million,
four hundred thousand.

33:54.325 --> 33:55.324
And in the pastor's fund?

33:55.326 --> 33:58.327
Please tell me there is
no pastor's account.

34:02.668 --> 34:04.271
We set up an account.

34:04.971 --> 34:06.871
A pastor's account,

34:06.873 --> 34:09.273
that would not technically be

34:09.275 --> 34:12.378
income to the Reverend
nor the Church.

34:13.913 --> 34:16.581
And the Reverend
spends from that account.

34:16.583 --> 34:17.652
<i>How much?</i>

34:18.985 --> 34:20.587
4.1 million.

34:24.489 --> 34:25.225
<i>Perfect.</i>

34:26.327 --> 34:29.598
<i>Now, please execute
this transaction.</i>

34:31.632 --> 34:33.335
No!

34:34.369 --> 34:37.206
No! No!

34:38.373 --> 34:40.208
We can't give him the money.

34:40.909 --> 34:41.940
Don't you understand?

34:41.943 --> 34:42.810
Reverend,
are you speaking out of

34:42.812 --> 34:43.842
concern for the
lives of your sheep

34:43.844 --> 34:46.647
or the loss of your luxury
home, car, boat, and

34:46.649 --> 34:49.283
- <i>apartments for your mistresses?</i>
- You shut your mouth!

34:49.284 --> 34:52.356
Do you hear me?
Shut your mouth!

34:53.389 --> 34:56.023
You son of a gun.

34:56.025 --> 34:58.326
This isn't some mafia family,

34:58.328 --> 35:00.262
this is a church!

35:00.264 --> 35:01.933
<i>You have a board.</i>

35:04.602 --> 35:06.672
And you two sicken me.

35:07.939 --> 35:12.508
I thought your toys were
paid for by your books.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.776
Books?

35:14.778 --> 35:17.413
Has anyone checked
his book sales?

35:17.415 --> 35:19.919
And I thought you were
the real thing.

35:23.989 --> 35:26.857
<i>Simply enter the two account
numbers in the first field.</i>

35:26.859 --> 35:29.963
<i>Enter pound total into
the second and press enter.</i>

35:34.967 --> 35:37.302
Give him what he wants.

35:37.304 --> 35:38.403
<i>Confirming the funds.</i>

35:38.405 --> 35:40.071
<i>We need that money.</i>

35:40.073 --> 35:40.674
<i>Done.</i>

35:42.310 --> 35:43.911
- It's there?
- It's there.

37:11.172 --> 37:12.737
Your turn.

37:43.673 --> 37:45.941
Guess those weren't
gunshots either.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.912
Lets get our boys and bail.

37:50.914 --> 37:52.080
Not yet.

37:52.082 --> 37:53.651
<i>Hello?</i>

37:55.854 --> 37:57.053
<i>Kind greetings.</i>

37:57.055 --> 38:00.056
<i>Who do I have the
pleasure of speaking with?</i>

38:00.058 --> 38:01.524
A witness.

38:01.526 --> 38:03.927
Someone who wants to go
along with her business.

38:03.929 --> 38:05.762
<i>But first, I need something.</i>

38:05.764 --> 38:08.566
Well, that presents us
with a problem.

38:08.568 --> 38:09.934
A couple of my friends
seem to be missing.

38:09.936 --> 38:11.004
Have you happened to see them?

38:12.972 --> 38:15.008
Well, if I have?

38:16.176 --> 38:17.875
<i>Then they should
return to me unharmed,</i>

38:17.877 --> 38:20.011
<i>and we can
consider your request.</i>

38:21.714 --> 38:22.983
And if I haven't?

38:24.718 --> 38:26.484
Then they should
return to me unharmed,

38:26.486 --> 38:28.022
and we will
consider your request.

38:29.556 --> 38:31.257
And if I don't?

38:31.259 --> 38:32.828
<i>Then you don't.</i>

38:34.027 --> 38:36.762
I guess we're at an impasse.

38:36.764 --> 38:38.563
Since our paths are
bound to cross,

38:38.565 --> 38:39.867
can I have the
pleasure of knowing

38:39.869 --> 38:42.002
who it is I'm speaking with?

38:42.004 --> 38:45.004
And give away the
element of surprise?

38:45.006 --> 38:46.508
<i>I hate surprises.</i>

38:47.709 --> 38:49.912
That sounds like we have
something in common.

38:51.079 --> 38:51.646
<i>Okay.</i>

38:52.648 --> 38:54.150
<i>I will see you soon.</i>

38:55.252 --> 38:57.121
Not before I see you.

39:03.759 --> 39:04.626
Find her.

39:04.628 --> 39:08.196
- Bro, she's not worth it...
- Find her.

39:16.975 --> 39:18.243
Attention, team.

39:19.710 --> 39:23.078
There seems to be a
loose end we need to clip.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.182
Find her.

39:24.850 --> 39:25.884
Kill her.

39:26.317 --> 39:27.652
<i>Black out.</i>

39:48.741 --> 39:50.812
Who are you?

39:51.913 --> 39:54.280
Shannon. HR.

39:54.282 --> 39:55.981
I heard the shots so I hid.

39:55.983 --> 39:57.316
<i>Where's Cindy?</i>

39:57.318 --> 39:59.288
Y-you mean Sarah?

40:00.355 --> 40:02.021
They took her.

40:02.023 --> 40:03.590
You let 'em?

40:03.592 --> 40:04.959
<i>I don't...</i>

40:04.961 --> 40:06.663
I'm not good with guns.

40:08.897 --> 40:10.863
You never told me your name.

40:10.865 --> 40:12.299
Bishop.

40:12.301 --> 40:13.734
<i>Laura Bishop.</i>

40:13.736 --> 40:15.806
<i>Clarke's kid?</i>

40:18.275 --> 40:20.043
<i>What a welcome back, huh?</i>

40:21.244 --> 40:22.947
I don't remember you.

40:26.183 --> 40:28.950
Laura Bishop.

40:28.952 --> 40:29.687
Wow!

40:30.821 --> 40:33.222
So, I guess it's true
what they said?

40:33.224 --> 40:35.223
Former secret
operations soldier,

40:35.225 --> 40:36.758
<i>or something,</i>

40:36.760 --> 40:37.993
<i>settled down to be a mom.</i>

40:37.995 --> 40:40.764
You know, I wanted to hear...
Oh, God.

40:40.766 --> 40:42.936
The little girl.
Where is she?

40:45.404 --> 40:46.402
Where is she?

40:46.404 --> 40:49.239
- The little girl.
- I-I don't...

40:49.241 --> 40:50.340
Are you with them?

40:50.342 --> 40:51.876
<i>No! No.</i>

40:51.878 --> 40:52.709
I don't believe you.

40:52.711 --> 40:56.347
Look at them.
And now, look at me.

40:56.349 --> 40:59.417
<i>I saw dudes with guns,
so I hid in the supply closet.</i>

40:59.419 --> 41:01.051
<i>Why'd you come out?</i>

41:01.053 --> 41:01.956
I'm...

41:03.757 --> 41:05.125
I'm afraid of the dark.

41:11.297 --> 41:13.431
We are gonna get
out of here, right?

41:13.433 --> 41:15.000
I am.

41:15.002 --> 41:16.202
<i>You...</i>

41:16.204 --> 41:18.207
You can find your own way.

41:19.340 --> 41:22.143
No, we am.

41:26.081 --> 41:27.651
I don't have time for this.

41:30.319 --> 41:32.055
Do not follow me.

42:00.852 --> 42:01.420
<i>Alright, lads.</i>

42:02.419 --> 42:04.454
Eyes on third floor.

42:04.456 --> 42:06.289
Third room on the left.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.326
Check it out.

42:08.126 --> 42:09.295
That didn't take long.

42:11.130 --> 42:12.699
Time for phase three.

44:17.467 --> 44:19.069
Phase three?

44:20.036 --> 44:21.272
There's only two phases.

44:22.339 --> 44:24.639
<i>No, there's always
been three.</i>

44:24.641 --> 44:27.110
But I couldn't share
until I secured the first two.

44:35.553 --> 44:37.088
I said let's go.

44:38.521 --> 44:40.223
I'm sorry, brother.

44:40.225 --> 44:40.960
You hypocrite.

44:42.293 --> 44:45.996
You wouldn't have helped
me if I told you the truth.

44:45.998 --> 44:46.899
You're a liar.

44:48.165 --> 44:51.501
You think I'm gonna go
to jail because of you?

44:51.503 --> 44:52.572
Huh?

44:56.376 --> 44:59.977
Well, believe me, I'll blow
your brains out right now.

44:59.979 --> 45:01.281
Put the gun down, friend.

45:02.981 --> 45:07.051
You've been a strong soldier
since our days over in Baghdad,

45:07.053 --> 45:10.257
but for the greater good
requires a greater sacrifice.

45:11.658 --> 45:13.627
Or, kill me.

45:14.995 --> 45:16.432
Because I'm not leaving.

45:27.709 --> 45:30.412
Your wife will have
enough to be okay.

45:32.681 --> 45:34.317
Brothers in arms.

45:36.319 --> 45:38.421
I need you to help me
finish this, man.

45:40.690 --> 45:42.926
- Ooh-rah!
- Ooh-rah!

45:56.307 --> 45:58.239
<i>It's like...</i>

45:58.241 --> 46:00.743
<i>people with guns,
and like...</i>

46:00.745 --> 46:02.114
I'm like...

46:02.680 --> 46:04.416
I'm really scared.

46:05.317 --> 46:07.217
I'm gonna go up there,

46:07.219 --> 46:09.422
and I'm gonna keep
looking for my daughter.

46:11.322 --> 46:13.389
No, no, no, no, no.
I have to come with you.

46:13.391 --> 46:15.493
- No, Shannon, you can't.
- No, I have to come with you.

46:15.495 --> 46:18.428
No, no, Shannon.
You can't go with me. No.

46:18.430 --> 46:20.397
But-but, we're friends.

46:20.399 --> 46:23.070
<i>No, we're not friends.
We are not friends.</i>

46:26.338 --> 46:27.574
Alright.

46:28.641 --> 46:30.608
I'm going this way.

46:30.610 --> 46:32.413
Take care of yourself,
okay?

46:34.181 --> 46:36.415
Are you cranky 'cause
the David thing?

46:36.417 --> 46:37.750
'Cause they're naming
a wing after David?

46:37.752 --> 46:38.684
- You don't know anything
- <i>Wait.</i>

46:38.686 --> 46:40.419
- about my husband.
- <i>Please don't.</i>

46:40.421 --> 46:41.553
Don't even bring his name up.

46:41.555 --> 46:43.555
I'm-I'm sorry.
I-I didn't...

46:43.557 --> 46:44.591
I didn't mean to upset you.

46:44.593 --> 46:46.995
I just was trying to
figure out what was wrong.

46:49.731 --> 46:50.796
D-did you wanna talk about it?

46:50.798 --> 46:51.799
No, I don't wanna
talk about it.

46:51.801 --> 46:53.034
It seems like you might
wanna talk about it

46:53.036 --> 46:56.369
because I remember one time
when I was like, really little...

46:56.371 --> 46:58.239
He died on this day
a year ago.

46:58.241 --> 46:59.607
<i>My daughter's trapped
in this building.</i>

46:59.609 --> 47:01.308
<i>There's a bunch of
gunmen going around.</i>

47:01.310 --> 47:04.146
My dad thinks I'm crazy.

47:04.148 --> 47:06.718
And I'm being shot at, and...

47:08.786 --> 47:10.521
Shannon, I'm tired.

47:11.255 --> 47:13.257
I'm really tired.

47:16.227 --> 47:17.196
Yeah.

47:22.567 --> 47:24.570
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

47:30.275 --> 47:31.742
<i>You're like
a real-life soldier,</i>

47:31.744 --> 47:34.577
like a "take a cyanide pill
when you're in trouble" kind.

47:34.579 --> 47:35.514
Shannon.

47:36.615 --> 47:37.780
Did they call you 007?

47:37.782 --> 47:40.451
- Shannon!
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

47:40.453 --> 47:41.654
Where are we going?

47:45.624 --> 47:46.593
<i>Kate!</i>

47:48.361 --> 47:49.330
Kate!

47:53.467 --> 47:54.365
Kate!

47:59.107 --> 48:00.041
Kate.

48:04.613 --> 48:06.745
Maybe, uh...

48:06.747 --> 48:08.316
she's not here?

48:16.458 --> 48:17.326
Mommy!

48:22.632 --> 48:23.634
<i>Mommy!</i>

48:24.601 --> 48:26.233
Cupcake.

48:27.838 --> 48:31.209
I was so worried about you.

48:33.144 --> 48:35.546
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

48:38.414 --> 48:40.482
Why weren't you in school today?

48:40.484 --> 48:43.652
Papa told me about
Daddy's surprise,

48:43.654 --> 48:46.389
and I wanted to be
here with you.

48:54.267 --> 48:55.602
Come here.

48:58.838 --> 49:01.108
A little too tight, Mommy.

49:01.807 --> 49:03.811
Oh, sorry.

49:06.879 --> 49:09.480
<i>Alright, so,</i>

49:09.482 --> 49:11.183
we're gonna
get out of here, okay?

49:11.185 --> 49:12.183
- Okay.
- Ready?

49:12.185 --> 49:13.353
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

49:17.559 --> 49:20.592
- We can't leave Xander and Shaw.
- Papa?

49:20.594 --> 49:22.394
Maybe you didn't notice
the gun-totin' bad guys?

49:22.396 --> 49:23.496
<i>I did.</i>

49:23.498 --> 49:25.831
Well, we'll get the police
and let them handle it.

49:25.833 --> 49:27.567
What if it's too late?

49:27.569 --> 49:28.902
It's not.

49:28.904 --> 49:31.404
Your grandpa is strong
and he can handle himself.

49:31.406 --> 49:32.441
Come on.

49:35.444 --> 49:37.611
He's gonna be fine.

49:37.613 --> 49:39.614
Police are gonna be here
before you know it.

49:39.616 --> 49:40.847
Come on.

49:40.849 --> 49:42.516
- Laura.
- Look!

49:42.518 --> 49:45.822
We're leaving and you can do
whatever you wanna do.

49:55.832 --> 49:57.299
I gotta get out of here.

49:57.301 --> 49:58.299
Where are you going?

49:58.301 --> 50:00.838
If I don't make it,
she stays with her uncle.

50:04.842 --> 50:05.645
Go!

50:06.844 --> 50:07.946
No, Mom, no!

50:08.880 --> 50:10.547
- Mom! Mom!
- Go, we gotta go!

50:10.549 --> 50:11.551
We gotta go, come on.

50:13.719 --> 50:14.487
Go!

50:17.423 --> 50:18.225
Take her!

50:59.935 --> 51:01.435
Psst.

51:18.756 --> 51:20.792
<i>You know what
really bothers me?</i>

51:25.096 --> 51:27.967
I told Sarah that
I'd be the first to go.

51:34.940 --> 51:36.873
You have all we got.

51:36.875 --> 51:38.742
Why not just let us go?

51:38.744 --> 51:41.546
<i>Oh, there's plenty left.</i>

51:41.548 --> 51:43.613
<i>I have all you have...
do you mean money?</i>

51:54.962 --> 51:57.496
Ooh.

51:57.498 --> 51:59.867
Oh.

52:01.936 --> 52:03.702
Oh, sorry, Rev.
Please forgive me.

52:03.704 --> 52:07.006
My manners have escaped me,
but it is laughable

52:07.008 --> 52:08.674
<i>that you believe
you will solve your problems</i>

52:08.676 --> 52:10.642
<i>here today with money.</i>

52:10.644 --> 52:12.479
<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.</i>

52:12.481 --> 52:14.680
Your problem's much deeper.

52:14.682 --> 52:19.387
Your problem lies at the very
foundation of this building.

52:19.389 --> 52:21.058
I don't understand.

52:22.090 --> 52:23.757
Tell you what, Mr. Shaw.

52:23.759 --> 52:26.560
If you're able to answer one of
three questions correctly,

52:26.562 --> 52:27.532
you live.

52:28.030 --> 52:29.433
If you can't...

52:35.005 --> 52:36.541
he dies.

52:39.643 --> 52:41.176
<i>Please tell me,</i>

52:41.178 --> 52:44.013
<i>who is Jonathan Waters?</i>

52:46.917 --> 52:48.717
You're asking me
about one person

52:48.719 --> 52:51.657
of about 250 million people.

52:52.791 --> 52:54.791
I don't think
that's a fair request.

52:54.793 --> 52:56.026
Mr. Shaw, I'll be generous.

52:56.028 --> 52:58.961
Every person I will ask about
is a member of this church.

52:58.963 --> 53:03.768
So again I ask,
who is Jonathan Waters?

53:03.770 --> 53:05.437
We have over ten thousand

53:05.439 --> 53:07.607
members of our church,
young man.

53:09.176 --> 53:10.141
<i>Very well.</i>

53:10.143 --> 53:12.576
Mr. Waters is a member here
who lost his job

53:12.578 --> 53:14.611
two years ago
at an aircraft company.

53:14.613 --> 53:16.981
<i>They say he was too qualified.
In other words, too old.</i>

53:16.983 --> 53:17.885
He lost his home

53:18.952 --> 53:20.519
and has reached out
to this church

53:20.521 --> 53:21.954
every day for
the past three months,

53:21.956 --> 53:24.490
and he has been unable to
secure an appointment with you.

53:24.492 --> 53:26.691
A homeless member
that has paid ties

53:26.693 --> 53:28.962
in this church for twenty years

53:28.964 --> 53:31.000
<i>can't even get time
with his pastor?</i>

53:32.633 --> 53:36.035
That, Mr. Shaw,
is who Mr. Waters is.

53:36.037 --> 53:37.636
Don't let that soak
in quite yet.

53:37.638 --> 53:40.009
Tell me who
Frances McAdams is.

53:42.612 --> 53:43.747
I don't know.

53:44.913 --> 53:46.847
Frances McAdams is
a member that attended

53:46.849 --> 53:48.715
this church for five years.

53:48.717 --> 53:51.620
Her son was snarled by the
horrible beast known as heroin.

53:51.622 --> 53:53.187
And when the youth's pastor
tried to get you to help,

53:53.189 --> 53:54.356
<i>you told them,
"Next week."</i>

53:54.358 --> 53:56.924
<i>Next week turned into
next year, and now,</i>

53:56.926 --> 53:58.193
<i>there is no tomorrow.</i>

53:59.463 --> 54:04.701
You don't know what it's like
to run a church of this size.

54:04.703 --> 54:07.036
And you have no idea

54:07.038 --> 54:10.840
what it's like to
walk a mile in my shoes.

54:10.842 --> 54:11.974
<i>You're right.</i>

54:11.976 --> 54:14.076
I don't know what it's
like to drive a Bentley while

54:14.078 --> 54:16.814
being supported by someone
who can't afford gas.

54:16.816 --> 54:17.981
I don't know
what it's like to live

54:17.983 --> 54:19.249
in a 10,000
square-foot home

54:19.251 --> 54:21.251
with my wife
and one child, no.

54:21.253 --> 54:22.820
<i>I grew up in an
1,800 square-foot</i>

54:22.822 --> 54:24.220
<i>home shared by five people.</i>

54:24.222 --> 54:26.856
And no, I do not know
what it's like to wear suits

54:26.858 --> 54:29.728
that cost more than
my members' full wardrobes.

54:29.730 --> 54:32.130
I don't know what it's like
to use my members' money

54:32.132 --> 54:35.866
<i>to house your mistresses,
you're right.</i>

54:35.868 --> 54:39.040
Do you think this is easy?

54:40.742 --> 54:41.743
Huh?

54:43.711 --> 54:46.778
What, am I not supposed
to live well?

54:46.780 --> 54:49.548
After workin' my
whole life and sacrificin'

54:49.550 --> 54:51.220
<i>to build this church?</i>

54:52.955 --> 54:54.857
And its ministry?

54:55.089 --> 54:55.825
Hmm?

54:57.192 --> 55:00.326
So you can sit there all pompous
and judge me for what,

55:00.328 --> 55:01.864
bein' successful?

55:03.867 --> 55:05.603
Let me ask you somethin'.

55:08.637 --> 55:10.807
Where are you

55:11.874 --> 55:14.010
when I tend to the burdens

55:16.714 --> 55:18.917
of my hurt flock?

55:21.785 --> 55:22.887
Hmm?

55:23.988 --> 55:26.024
When I'm at my wit's end,

55:27.326 --> 55:29.762
<i>and I suffer their pain
and their strife?</i>

55:31.295 --> 55:32.963
And their darkness,

55:32.965 --> 55:34.731
and I have no one
to talk to,

55:34.733 --> 55:36.132
nowhere to go?

55:36.134 --> 55:38.802
Because I suffer with them.

55:38.804 --> 55:41.973
I bear their burdens with them.

55:44.209 --> 55:45.611
<i>Where are you?</i>

55:46.245 --> 55:48.212
<i>So you're gonna judge me</i>

55:48.214 --> 55:49.249
for my success?

55:50.115 --> 55:51.151
<i>For my possessions?</i>

55:52.752 --> 55:55.222
Well, you don't have the right
to judge me, young man.

55:57.023 --> 55:58.190
You don't have the luxury.

55:58.192 --> 56:02.326
<i>Why don't you go ahead
and cast that stone?</i>

56:02.328 --> 56:04.599
<i>You waltz into my building</i>

56:05.300 --> 56:07.133
with your criminal element,

56:07.135 --> 56:08.968
totin' your guns,

56:08.970 --> 56:12.104
<i>killin' our people,
stealin' our money.</i>

56:12.106 --> 56:14.807
And you have the audacity
to point your finger

56:14.809 --> 56:16.846
and call me the bad guy?

56:17.145 --> 56:18.344
Yes.

56:18.346 --> 56:21.281
You mentioned building this
building, this new building.

56:21.283 --> 56:24.621
Perfect transition to
my last question, Mr. Shaw.

56:25.955 --> 56:27.124
Who is Dolores Gentry?

56:29.992 --> 56:31.859
I don't know.

56:31.861 --> 56:33.961
<i>I can't possibly know</i>

56:33.963 --> 56:38.298
the name of every member
of my congregation.

56:38.300 --> 56:39.036
It's impossible.

56:40.772 --> 56:44.272
"The one who enters by the gate
is the shepherd of the sheep.

56:44.274 --> 56:46.042
"The gatekeepers open
the gate for him,

56:46.044 --> 56:47.777
"and the sheep listen
to his voice.

56:47.779 --> 56:51.414
"He calls out his own sheep
by name and leads them out."

56:51.416 --> 56:53.619
I am not God.

56:56.387 --> 56:59.155
Finally, an admission
worth notation.

56:59.157 --> 57:01.157
You are not God.

57:01.159 --> 57:03.863
He owns the heavens,
not you.

57:05.098 --> 57:08.866
<i>Dolores Gentry
is not just a member.</i>

57:08.868 --> 57:11.703
She left you this land to
build this building, and yet,

57:11.705 --> 57:13.136
you did not have the time,

57:13.138 --> 57:16.742
the decency to
fill one wish for her.

57:16.744 --> 57:18.876
Just to hold her hand
and pray with her.

57:18.878 --> 57:22.748
She was dying, and you were
being paid to be a celebrity.

57:34.028 --> 57:37.096
Dolores Gentry was my mother.

57:42.070 --> 57:43.105
Now.

58:29.422 --> 58:30.888
You know what, Mr. Shaw?

58:33.292 --> 58:35.395
I think it's time we
finished this discussion...

58:37.096 --> 58:38.299
face to face.

58:46.474 --> 58:48.541
You know this is
all your fault, right?

58:48.543 --> 58:51.011
After all that money
I spent on security,

58:51.013 --> 58:53.245
you told me this church
would be impenetrable.

58:53.247 --> 58:55.350
- Hey.
- Now look at us.

58:57.018 --> 58:58.919
You lay this at my feet.

58:58.921 --> 59:01.187
Who do you think
you're grabbin', huh?

59:01.189 --> 59:05.392
I gave you a push,
a nudge in the right direction.

59:05.394 --> 59:06.994
And you're the one that
called attention to this.

59:06.996 --> 59:08.496
You're the one with all the
bling and the cars

59:08.498 --> 59:09.530
- and the money.
- Yeah.

59:09.532 --> 59:11.298
You're the one that's
supposed to keep us safe!

59:11.300 --> 59:13.900
You're delusional, man.
You're delusional!

59:13.902 --> 59:15.169
<i>I'm tired
of listening to you.</i>

59:15.171 --> 59:16.171
<i>He's delusional.</i>

59:16.173 --> 59:18.073
Shut up!

59:18.075 --> 59:19.174
It's now or never.

59:21.845 --> 59:22.944
Shut up!

59:22.946 --> 59:24.245
Shut up!

59:24.247 --> 59:25.015
Now.

59:25.549 --> 59:27.416
Shut up!

59:27.418 --> 59:29.184
Ahh!

59:56.583 --> 59:57.585
Wait.

59:59.286 --> 01:00:00.221
Wait.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.087
Wait.

01:00:06.093 --> 01:00:07.329
I'll get you Shaw.

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:12.066
I'll kill Bishop, too.

01:00:14.401 --> 01:00:16.406
<i>I know this place
better than anyone.</i>

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.241
Your price?

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:23.545
My life.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.965
Don't worry,
I'll protect you.

01:00:55.646 --> 01:00:57.415
Shannon!

01:00:58.215 --> 01:00:59.018
Mommy!

01:00:59.784 --> 01:01:01.617
- Come here.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:04.087
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry.

01:01:04.089 --> 01:01:05.422
- Wait, Laura.
- <i>Let's go.</i>

01:01:05.424 --> 01:01:07.290
No... Laura?
Don't leave me, don't leave me!

01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:08.327
No, come back!

01:01:15.001 --> 01:01:16.668
I'll get you out of here.
Let's go.

01:01:19.139 --> 01:01:20.505
<i>Go, take her. Take her.</i>

01:01:20.507 --> 01:01:22.175
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:29.482
You can't run from
the imposters.

01:01:29.484 --> 01:01:32.218
I'm ready.
Are you?

01:01:34.089 --> 01:01:36.125
Come on.

01:01:37.559 --> 01:01:40.326
- I'm trying.
- What about Papa?

01:01:40.328 --> 01:01:42.730
You're a quitter.
You're quitting on him.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.764
You're quitting on me.
You're a quitter.

01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:47.534
You're safe, alright?
I have to get you out of here.

01:01:47.536 --> 01:01:48.271
Okay?

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:51.638
I just need you to do
this big girl thing for me.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.209
I promise you.
I promise you.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.243
<i>And I need you to run
till you see the police,</i>

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.446
<i>and I need you to...
don't stop.</i>

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.015
Come on.
Do this for me.

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:01.483
No.

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:04.119
<i>Please, come on.
Come on. Baby, come on.</i>

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:06.357
I love you so much.

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:19.639
No, no.

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:24.240
I'm sorry.

01:02:24.242 --> 01:02:26.576
Please, please.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.815
<i>Move.</i>

01:03:39.624 --> 01:03:42.258
<i>Stand down.
I'm bringing in Shaw.</i>

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.794
<i>I'll bring you Bishop, too.</i>

01:03:43.796 --> 01:03:46.099
I just need your word
I leave here alive.

01:03:51.471 --> 01:03:52.806
We got a deal?

01:03:56.176 --> 01:03:58.710
You're a strange fella,
you know that?

01:03:58.712 --> 01:04:02.380
You were willing to help me
catch him just to save yourself?

01:04:02.382 --> 01:04:04.453
Everything I do is
about survival.

01:04:08.356 --> 01:04:09.624
Have a seat.

01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:18.701
Yo, Mark.

01:04:20.835 --> 01:04:22.237
<i>You're fired.</i>

01:04:27.677 --> 01:04:29.780
Man fired the man.

01:04:44.962 --> 01:04:46.730
So the question...

01:04:48.332 --> 01:04:52.568
about what it is I want
has been lingering in the air.

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:55.540
I think it's time now
I provide you with an answer.

01:04:56.974 --> 01:04:58.907
You will never profit
off another person,

01:04:58.909 --> 01:05:00.976
betray another person,
and I will make sure

01:05:00.978 --> 01:05:03.549
<i>no one will ever mistake you
to be a god.</i>

01:05:07.819 --> 01:05:09.486
How you plannin' on doin' that?

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:12.355
By confessin' our sins,
Reverend.

01:05:12.357 --> 01:05:15.293
<i>He is faithful and just.</i>

01:05:15.295 --> 01:05:17.728
He is the atoning sacrifice
for our sins.

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:19.664
<i>But not just ours, Reverend.</i>

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.702
<i>But the sins of the
whole world.</i>

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:26.439
So you want me to
atone for my sins?

01:05:26.441 --> 01:05:29.741
So you actually do
know the scriptures.

01:05:29.743 --> 01:05:31.343
Yes, Reverend.

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:33.414
I want you to atone
for your sins.

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:37.616
I want you to look into
that camera over there,

01:05:37.618 --> 01:05:39.388
and tell your flock.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.761
Atone for your sins.

01:05:55.905 --> 01:05:57.441
<i>Or we all die.</i>

01:06:00.644 --> 01:06:02.681
You're gonna give
that choice to me?

01:06:08.419 --> 01:06:09.888
You are sharp.

01:06:11.656 --> 01:06:13.291
Very smart.

01:06:16.461 --> 01:06:19.396
Only you can't die a martyr.

01:06:19.398 --> 01:06:20.829
Mm-mmm.

01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:23.966
Martyr has to die
with no choice.

01:06:23.968 --> 01:06:26.569
A true martyr dies

01:06:26.571 --> 01:06:29.306
with faith in everything
that he believes, no options.

01:06:29.308 --> 01:06:31.042
You, son, have a choice.

01:06:31.044 --> 01:06:32.743
<i>So if you want to die
out of the grandeur,</i>

01:06:32.745 --> 01:06:34.312
<i>that's on you.</i>

01:06:34.314 --> 01:06:36.950
You think this is
about me, hmm?

01:06:38.485 --> 01:06:39.487
<i>Isn't it?</i>

01:06:58.006 --> 01:07:01.410
Looks like you have run
out of places to hide.

01:07:05.514 --> 01:07:06.883
<i>I think you took a wrong turn.</i>

01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:09.286
<i>I know where I am.</i>

01:07:09.884 --> 01:07:11.784
But more importantly,

01:07:11.786 --> 01:07:13.455
I know where you die.

01:07:15.859 --> 01:07:17.424
<i>I hope you know
how to use those.</i>

01:07:43.088 --> 01:07:43.990
Ah!

01:09:31.537 --> 01:09:33.742
<i>Come on, Laura.</i>

01:10:30.903 --> 01:10:32.135
Bishop!

01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:01.570
You think this is
about me, hmm?

01:11:02.704 --> 01:11:03.206
<i>Isn't it?</i>

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.609
<i>I mean, you come
in here pullin' triggers.</i>

01:11:08.109 --> 01:11:10.546
Killin' my people,
took all that money.

01:11:11.646 --> 01:11:13.716
Spittin' judgements at me.

01:11:14.818 --> 01:11:17.085
<i>You have the means
to the money.</i>

01:11:17.087 --> 01:11:18.752
<i>You have your own agenda,</i>

01:11:18.754 --> 01:11:21.822
and you're usin' your
poor mother as justification...

01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:23.894
<i>You don't
know anything about me.</i>

01:11:25.828 --> 01:11:27.863
You think that money was for me?

01:11:27.865 --> 01:11:29.067
It wasn't for me.

01:11:29.734 --> 01:11:30.267
Right now,

01:11:31.334 --> 01:11:34.068
there are groups
that actually care,

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:38.610
receiving anonymous donations
that will total $14 million.

01:11:40.144 --> 01:11:42.678
So how could it be about me...

01:11:47.052 --> 01:11:49.218
when I never planned
on leaving alive?

01:11:58.296 --> 01:12:00.067
<i>This timer stops</i>

01:12:01.867 --> 01:12:03.704
only once you confess.

01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:19.922
This land

01:12:20.989 --> 01:12:23.221
belongs to the blood
of my ancestors,

01:12:23.223 --> 01:12:25.958
and this building will not stand

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.095
as long as you're pastor.

01:12:37.138 --> 01:12:38.306
I'll quit.

01:12:38.308 --> 01:12:40.176
You'll quit.

01:12:43.045 --> 01:12:44.347
It's too late for that.

01:13:01.866 --> 01:13:05.801
<i>You will confess
live to your members</i>

01:13:05.803 --> 01:13:07.272
and to the world.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.506
And then this stops,

01:13:10.508 --> 01:13:12.377
and I bid you farewell.

01:13:41.108 --> 01:13:44.878
I, Reverend Mark Shaw,
confess

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.447
to not up-upholding
the standard

01:13:48.449 --> 01:13:50.483
entrusted in me

01:13:50.485 --> 01:13:52.722
by the Christian church,

01:13:53.456 --> 01:13:56.258
<i>loved ones, and my creator.</i>

01:14:08.137 --> 01:14:10.971
To my wife, Jenny,

01:14:18.516 --> 01:14:20.949
I have not been faithful to you.

01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:22.253
I broke our covenant.

01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:29.325
And I know that the
revelation of this news

01:14:29.327 --> 01:14:31.196
is gonna cause
great harm to you,

01:14:32.298 --> 01:14:33.532
to my son.

01:14:34.834 --> 01:14:38.102
<i>I'm truly sorry</i>

01:14:38.104 --> 01:14:40.437
to my church members.

01:14:40.439 --> 01:14:42.307
I have allowed
earthly possessions

01:14:42.309 --> 01:14:44.241
to cloud my spiritual calling.

01:14:44.243 --> 01:14:46.210
<i>I came to believe that</i>

01:14:46.212 --> 01:14:48.545
<i>the measure of my success</i>

01:14:48.547 --> 01:14:51.916
<i>was measured by
the things that I owned.</i>

01:14:51.918 --> 01:14:56.221
Honestly, I started to
worship my own shine,

01:14:56.223 --> 01:14:58.858
<i>and I am ashamed of that.</i>

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.095
<i>Truly ashamed.</i>

01:15:01.462 --> 01:15:05.931
And when you trusted me most,
I turned my back on you.

01:15:05.933 --> 01:15:09.070
And there's no way
I can make amends for that.

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:18.346
The events that have transpired
on this godforsaken Friday

01:15:18.348 --> 01:15:21.181
<i>have caused much harm.</i>

01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:31.328
<i>But most of all,</i>

01:15:32.363 --> 01:15:35.366
I didn't uphold my
responsibility

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.076
<i>to God.</i>

01:15:46.243 --> 01:15:49.113
<i>And I got nobody to blame
but myself.</i>

01:16:00.025 --> 01:16:01.193
I...

01:16:07.968 --> 01:16:10.938
I don't deserve the title
of Reverend.

01:16:15.009 --> 01:16:16.444
May God forgive me.

01:16:31.327 --> 01:16:32.625
<i>Let me go.</i>

01:16:32.627 --> 01:16:34.527
<i>No, I'm not letting go.</i>

01:16:34.529 --> 01:16:36.196
Laura!

01:16:40.169 --> 01:16:41.004
Try.

01:16:41.604 --> 01:16:43.507
Laura, I'm too heavy.

01:16:46.409 --> 01:16:49.613
<i>Come on, you gotta try.
Please.</i>

01:16:55.386 --> 01:16:57.388
You didn't fail me.

01:16:58.556 --> 01:17:01.293
You did everything
you could humanly do.

01:17:03.428 --> 01:17:06.532
- <i>David, you're slipping. No!</i>
- Find God.

01:17:07.765 --> 01:17:09.969
The world needs you.

01:17:11.036 --> 01:17:11.935
I need you.

01:17:11.937 --> 01:17:15.339
- You can't do this alone.
- No!

01:17:15.341 --> 01:17:17.711
No! No!

01:17:44.506 --> 01:17:47.142
Can you please stop
the timer now,

01:17:48.243 --> 01:17:49.511
Courtney?

01:17:53.315 --> 01:17:55.352
You remember my name.

01:17:56.218 --> 01:17:57.620
Lowly janitor.

01:18:06.263 --> 01:18:07.430
Yes.

01:18:09.131 --> 01:18:10.734
I remember you.

01:18:15.338 --> 01:18:17.141
Please turn it off.

01:18:20.177 --> 01:18:21.380
Please.

01:18:22.779 --> 01:18:24.315
I won't.

01:18:32.123 --> 01:18:33.358
Reverend.

01:18:35.394 --> 01:18:37.327
I want you to know that
out of all the lives

01:18:37.329 --> 01:18:38.399
that were destroyed today,

01:18:40.365 --> 01:18:42.499
yours means the least to me.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:58.685
Hello, Bishop.

01:19:00.321 --> 01:19:01.855
And here I thought

01:19:01.857 --> 01:19:03.426
you were no longer with us.

01:19:07.595 --> 01:19:08.630
<i>I told you</i>

01:19:09.497 --> 01:19:10.366
I was gonna see you.

01:19:50.843 --> 01:19:52.545
You just won't die.

01:20:34.589 --> 01:20:35.324
Laura.

01:21:03.654 --> 01:21:05.621
Protects the heart, right?

01:21:05.623 --> 01:21:06.723
Yeah.

01:21:06.725 --> 01:21:10.460
I thought... I thought
you didn't know how to shoot.

01:21:12.864 --> 01:21:14.401
Lucky shot.

01:21:17.503 --> 01:21:19.539
No such thing as luck.

01:21:22.475 --> 01:21:23.677
Shh.

01:21:24.776 --> 01:21:26.780
Shh, shh, shh.

01:21:33.187 --> 01:21:37.455
That you're a hero
and my friend.

01:22:14.732 --> 01:22:15.700
Shit!

01:22:54.374 --> 01:22:54.975
Oh, my God.

01:23:08.021 --> 01:23:10.756
Come on. Get up,
we gotta go.

01:23:10.758 --> 01:23:12.591
Laura, that you?

01:23:12.593 --> 01:23:13.761
I'm your daughter.

01:23:13.763 --> 01:23:16.963
- Come on. We gotta go.
- I can't.

01:23:16.965 --> 01:23:18.668
- I'm too heavy.
- No.

01:23:19.934 --> 01:23:24.872
I just never could lose
these last ten pounds.

01:23:28.444 --> 01:23:29.112
Please.

01:23:32.148 --> 01:23:34.352
I'm not leaving you.

01:23:37.153 --> 01:23:39.988
Laura, sometimes...

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:43.558
sometimes you just have
to have faith.

01:25:13.826 --> 01:25:15.558
<i>Many people turned
away from the church</i>

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.194
<i>after Shaw's confession.</i>

01:25:17.196 --> 01:25:18.898
<i>I was angry, too.</i>

01:25:19.732 --> 01:25:20.899
<i>For a while.</i>

01:25:21.599 --> 01:25:22.999
<i>But in the end,</i>

01:25:23.001 --> 01:25:25.134
<i>I chose to remember him
as he was</i>

01:25:25.136 --> 01:25:27.871
<i>when I first heard him preach.</i>

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:29.741
<i>He was somethin'.</i>

01:25:29.743 --> 01:25:31.942
<i>That's why nothin',</i>

01:25:31.944 --> 01:25:35.847
and I mean nothin' in God's
world happens by mistake.

01:25:35.849 --> 01:25:37.849
Everything's for a reason.

01:25:37.851 --> 01:25:40.685
<i>Nobody ever promised us
that life would be easy.</i>

01:25:40.687 --> 01:25:43.154
<i>If life were easy,
there'd be no value in it.</i>

01:25:43.156 --> 01:25:46.891
So the key is to pray for
the knowledge of God's will,

01:25:46.893 --> 01:25:49.127
nothin' more, nothin' less,
nothin' else,

01:25:49.129 --> 01:25:50.932
and the power
to carry that out.

01:25:52.634 --> 01:25:54.136
- Faith and action.
- <i>Amen.</i>

01:25:55.571 --> 01:25:57.737
I'm here to tell you
no one gets to the Father

01:25:57.739 --> 01:25:59.706
but through the Son.
Amen.

01:25:59.708 --> 01:26:00.742
<i>Amen.</i>

01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:03.843
Life is not
about the destination,

01:26:03.845 --> 01:26:06.580
it is about the journey.

01:26:06.582 --> 01:26:10.083
And sometimes the journey
can seem bleak, dark, hopeless.

01:26:10.085 --> 01:26:12.919
<i>It can feel like it
has no meaning.</i>

01:26:12.921 --> 01:26:16.124
And that's when you turn to the
one who gives all meaning.

01:26:16.126 --> 01:26:19.361
And that one is God.
May you find Him right now.

01:26:19.363 --> 01:26:22.164
<i>Y'all remember to be
grateful this week.</i>

01:26:22.166 --> 01:26:24.700
See how you can be of
maximum service to God

01:26:24.702 --> 01:26:27.370
and to your fellow
brothers and sisters,

01:26:27.372 --> 01:26:29.906
and rejoice in each day.

01:26:29.908 --> 01:26:32.308
And I'll see you all
next week, same time.

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:33.475
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:26:33.477 --> 01:26:35.777
<i>Not a day goes
by that I don't think of</i>

01:26:35.779 --> 01:26:39.382
<i>everyone who lost
their life that night.</i>

01:26:39.384 --> 01:26:43.720
<i>My dad's smile is forever
etched in my memory.</i>

01:26:43.722 --> 01:26:46.657
<i>He made me promise
to take care of Kate.</i>

01:26:46.659 --> 01:26:49.296
<i>That's the easiest promise
I've ever made.</i>

01:26:58.304 --> 01:27:00.171
<i>I have lost</i>

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:03.142
<i>a lot of people dear to me.</i>

01:27:03.144 --> 01:27:05.811
<i>Some people wonder
why we should live</i>

01:27:05.813 --> 01:27:08.813
<i>if we're destined to die.</i>

01:27:08.815 --> 01:27:11.049
<i>But the challenge
is to live</i>

01:27:11.051 --> 01:27:13.922
<i>so a part of us never dies.</i>

01:27:33.976 --> 01:27:37.279
Morning, sunshine cupcake.

01:27:37.281 --> 01:27:40.149
Morning,
sunshine Kool-aid.

01:27:46.824 --> 01:27:48.423
<i>I'm healing</i>

01:27:48.425 --> 01:27:52.865
<i>physically, mentally,
and spiritually.</i>

01:27:53.999 --> 01:27:56.199
<i>I'm a work in progress,</i>

01:27:56.201 --> 01:27:58.435
<i>but I'll be ready
to take on anything</i>

01:27:58.437 --> 01:28:01.772
<i>that the world has
to throw at me.</i>

01:28:01.774 --> 01:28:04.945
<i>If you ever find yourself
in need of help,</i>

01:28:06.179 --> 01:28:07.911
<i>I know a good woman.</i>
