LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hello, #Jafael shippers.

00:03.804 --> 00:05.306
I hope you can keep
your mouth shut,

00:05.339 --> 00:07.241
because Jane and Rafael
are secretly exploring

00:07.275 --> 00:08.476
their feelings for each other.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.178
Also keeping a secret?

00:10.211 --> 00:11.479
Petra's lawyer, Jane Ramos,

00:11.512 --> 00:13.747
AKA J.R.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.149
See, she's working
with some shady figures

00:15.183 --> 00:17.085
to get Petra thrown in jail.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.552
Straight out of a telenovela,
right?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.154
Well, imagine this.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.123
Jane's father put his career
on hold to focus

00:22.156 --> 00:24.758
on being a stay-at-home dad
to his baby, Baby.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.460
Only that turned out
to be boring, boring.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.330
Also stuck? Our Jane.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.598
See, she had writer's block.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.433
And to make matters worse,

00:32.466 --> 00:34.135
Petra got herself a book deal.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.136
Okay!

00:35.169 --> 00:36.737
And then this happened.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.139
Jane, will you ghostwrite
my book?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.241
And speaking
of complicated coworkers,

00:40.274 --> 00:42.110
Alba is still working
with Jorge,

00:42.143 --> 00:44.312
after she rejected
his marriage proposal.
No.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.181
And so, he moved on,
leaving our abuela single

00:47.215 --> 00:48.449
and ready to mingle.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.817
So, open the sunroof,

00:49.850 --> 00:52.220
'cause it's about to get hot
in here.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.255
Friends,

00:54.288 --> 00:57.325
Jane's Gloriana Villanueva's
sexual evolution

00:57.358 --> 00:59.393
went through many stages.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.197
Fear.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.533
We should stop!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.435
Denial.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.736
Temptation.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.572
I'm fine! I really want
to do this. I'm...

01:11.605 --> 01:13.241
Negotiation.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.108
Wow.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.176
How do you feel?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.211
Good. I feel good.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.412
Acceptance.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.114
Liberation.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.682
And, finally...

01:23.417 --> 01:25.586
Let me just put the seat down.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.289
...car sex.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.193
No, no, no. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.262
I don't want to do this.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.863
Are you insane?

01:35.896 --> 01:38.466
We can't have sex for
the first time in a car.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.701
:
Oh... Mwah!

01:40.734 --> 01:42.236
Sure, we can.
No.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.238
Oh, hey. No, no, no, no.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.807
No way. Not after how judgy
you were about that kiss.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.644
I need my full range
of motion. Mm.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.246
Mm!

02:00.654 --> 02:02.356
JANE:
Okay, so let's go upstairs

02:02.390 --> 02:03.357
to your apartment.
The girls

02:03.391 --> 02:04.492
will be here in 15 minutes.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.327
And we don't have
to rush this.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.329
The whole point of dating
in secret is to see

02:08.362 --> 02:09.630
if we can be
a normal couple.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.365
So I'm taking you out first.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.633
On a date.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.836
Oh. So romantic.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.405
Make it a short date.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.706
Let me see your dating profile!

02:20.308 --> 02:22.176
Oh, come on.
Let me see what you got.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.922
Okay, that's
a good start.
Eh.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.891
It's a little...
rigid.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.562
Clergymen and monks?

02:41.595 --> 02:43.331
Because that's what you're
gonna get with this profile.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.610
Fine. Then look around
and make a move.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.779
Or I'm gonna change that profile

02:58.812 --> 03:02.216
and I'm gonna describe
you as "fun-loving."

03:10.558 --> 03:13.927
Abuela, when we sell this,
I can quit the lounge.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.930
Plus, it'll give me a nice
break from having to think

03:16.964 --> 03:19.367
of overly-complicated,
soapy, romantic plots.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.668
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Tell me about it.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.472
Book templates.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.475
I want to see
what Petra responds to.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.776
Hmm?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.711
Unfortunately,

03:30.744 --> 03:32.513
I didn't respond to any of this.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.483
But that's okay because
how are we supposed to know

03:35.516 --> 03:37.518
what we like if we don't
know what we hate?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.020
Right. Glad I can help
with that.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.389
I don't want to be derivative.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.623
I want to create my own brand.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.826
I mean, I can't relate
to Martha Stewart,

03:45.859 --> 03:48.362
Chrissy Teigen or
Bethenny Frankel.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.830
I'm a businesswoman,
not some celebrity

03:49.863 --> 03:51.565
who's had their name
slapped on a business.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.033
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey, back off Chrissy Teigen.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.468
She's a literal legend.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.271
I built this hotel
from the ground up.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.572
I want this book to reflect

03:58.606 --> 04:00.040
how hard I've worked. Hey!

04:00.073 --> 04:03.611
Those StairMasters should
obviously be facing the windows.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.447
Sorry. Uh, you didn't specify.
Yeah, I also didn't
specifically say

04:06.480 --> 04:07.981
not to put them upside down.
It's common sense.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.116
We're renovating the gym.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.452
I test everything myself
before I put it in the hotel.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.620
I'm that thorough.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.654
See, that's the
kind of stuff

04:13.687 --> 04:15.289
the book should be about.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.624
Yeah, got it.
That sounds great.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.359
I just need
to know the template

04:18.392 --> 04:20.428
so I know what kind of book
I'm writing.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.962
I am the template.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.064
Think outside the
box for this book.

04:24.097 --> 04:28.902
Maybe... maybe it's not
even a regular book?

04:28.936 --> 04:30.671
Maybe it's in the shape of me?

04:30.704 --> 04:32.306
Or the hotel?

04:32.340 --> 04:34.074
Got it.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.610
You know, we can decide
the shape of the book later.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.612
For now, we need
to submit a proposal.

04:38.646 --> 04:42.683
So, would you say it's more
a autobiography?

04:43.951 --> 04:47.455
Or, uh, would it be more
a lifestyle book?

04:47.488 --> 04:48.656
Or a collection of stories?

04:48.689 --> 04:51.959
Or all three woven together?

04:51.992 --> 04:56.330
Okay, but what category would it
fall into, like, the most?

04:56.364 --> 04:57.598
Let's not categorize.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.401
Does it have pictures
or no pictures?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.435
Don't condescend, Jane.

05:01.469 --> 05:04.372
Of course it has pictures
with my new haircut.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.009
Look, I'm sorry.

05:09.042 --> 05:12.380
I really want this
to be a happy collaboration.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.715
So do I, honestly.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.350
And I love your haircut.

05:16.384 --> 05:19.119
You know, we're just getting
tripped up on hypotheticals.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.688
Let me work on the proposal.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.089
I worked for a publisher.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.691
I can knock this out.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.725
Perfect.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.427
Good plan.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.928
Go forth and write, Jane.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.530
ROGELIO:
You can do it.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.765
Roll.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.401
Come on, Baby.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.402
I believe in you.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.470
Use your core.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.717
Oh, good, you're home.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.386
Hello. How was dance class?

05:52.420 --> 05:53.721
Great.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.922
I love teaching without
the responsibility

05:54.955 --> 05:56.524
of running a studio.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.991
How about you?

05:58.025 --> 06:00.160
Any progress
with the roll?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.996
Not yet,
but we're plugging away.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.700
I, too, feel like
I am living the dream.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.569
Hon, are you okay?

06:08.602 --> 06:09.970
Of course.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.406
So, you're not at all
regretting your decision

06:12.440 --> 06:13.574
to stay at home with Baby?

06:13.607 --> 06:17.010
I am miserable, Xo.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.579
All Baby does is

06:18.612 --> 06:21.582
sleep and poop and sleep
and poop and sleep.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.518
I thought being home with her
would be fun and fulfilling.

06:24.552 --> 06:27.154
But I'm bored
and resentful.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.022
And I'm a monster.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.525
You are not a monster.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.027
Being a stay-at-home
parent is really hard.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.430
So, do you think it's okay
for me to call it?

06:36.464 --> 06:38.165
What? No.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.667
You haven't given
it a real shot.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.668
But I'm miserable.

06:40.701 --> 06:44.572
You just need some human
contact, the adult kind.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.939
You should join
a parent group.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.841
Are there celebrity ones?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.042
You don't need to be
around celebrities.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.611
Just normal parents

06:50.644 --> 06:52.045
who are feeling
what you're feeling.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.008
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay, Jane,

07:21.041 --> 07:23.010
just reinvent the book form.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.480
No pages, no chapters,
no words,

07:26.514 --> 07:27.981
but definitely a narrator.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.119
Good idea.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.187
Just free-associate. Get loose.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.528
Harsh.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.539
Much better.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.575
Petra is strong,
determined, driven...

07:54.608 --> 07:55.709
Insulted.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.511
Flat-out insulted.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.812
That's the only way
to describe it.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.180
"I strive to create

08:00.213 --> 08:03.050
a work environment that feels
warm and communicative"?

08:03.083 --> 08:05.118
I would never say that.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.620
It-it-it's too...

08:06.654 --> 08:08.589
Nice?
Nauseating!

08:08.622 --> 08:10.591
And frankly,
I'm...

08:10.624 --> 08:11.792
I'm feeling judged here.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.595
I just softened it a bit to
paint you in a better light

08:14.628 --> 08:15.663
to help sell the book.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.897
Better light to whom?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.065
I hate this woman.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.800
And I like myself, Jane.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.769
I am really sorry.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.604
I didn't mean to insult you.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.639
I know.

08:28.676 --> 08:32.580
Look, our friendship and family
is really important to me.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.981
Ah, me, too.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.182
Then maybe we should
protect that

08:35.215 --> 08:36.750
and I should find
a different ghostwriter.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.123
All right, let's just calm down
for a bit.

08:43.156 --> 08:46.093
I think that this
is gonna work out just fine.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.261
I mean, we've worked together
for years at the Marbella.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.830
That's true.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.298
Right? This is just
a new dynamic.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.966
We just need to
find our groove.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.001
How long will that take?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.303
What
Yes.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.171
I mean, I don't know.
Because running a hotel

08:58.205 --> 08:59.707
is very time-consuming.
It's not exactly a
set thing, but I...

08:59.740 --> 09:01.875
I have a million problems
to solve, fires to put out.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.176
That's what I wish
you understood, Jane.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.312
The-the rigors
of my daily life.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.716
You should shadow me.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.150
Shadow you?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.952
Follow me around.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.120
Really get inside my head.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.087
That way,
you-you could see

09:14.121 --> 09:15.856
how much I accomplish
every day.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.725
You'll gain respect for me
because how could you not?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.159
And then you'll be able
to write the book.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.094
That sounds great.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.596
It's gonna be a nightmare.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.031
But you know what?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.198
I'm gonna suck it up
because this could be

09:25.232 --> 09:27.134
a great way
to make money writing

09:27.167 --> 09:28.736
until inspiration strikes.
Hey.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.037
Are you ready for work?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.238
Hey, yeah. Almost ready.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.339
MATEO:
Daddy, wait.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.274
I need your help
with my school project.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.109
XIOMARA:
Oh, how cute.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.045
You're making a family tree

09:38.078 --> 09:38.912
at school.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.248
Yes, but I couldn't think
of anyone

09:41.281 --> 09:43.684
on Daddy's side
except Auntie Petra.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.656
I was adopted and both
my parents passed away.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.290
Remember? I'm sorry you
never got to meet them.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.292
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Really? One was a thief

09:52.325 --> 09:54.194
and the other was
a serial killer.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.262
I can give you
their names.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.263
Just don't Google them.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.131
What about
your real parents?

09:58.165 --> 09:59.933
You mean his biological parents.

09:59.967 --> 10:03.637
Uh, actually, buddy, I
don't know who they are.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.238
Don't you want to know?
Maybe they're pirates.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.174
RAFAEL: Maybe,
but I'm kind of happy

10:07.207 --> 10:08.676
with the way things are.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.177
But what if...
And the good news

10:10.210 --> 10:11.912
is that your mommy's side
of the family is so big

10:11.945 --> 10:13.280
and so filled with love

10:13.313 --> 10:15.949
that maybe you just
focus on that, okay?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.186
We should get to work.

10:20.788 --> 10:21.989
NARRATOR:
And, friends,

10:22.022 --> 10:23.691
it should be noted
that by "work,"

10:23.724 --> 10:25.292
he meant...

10:25.325 --> 10:28.128
their top secret date.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.162
Well, hello there.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.998
I'm Rafael.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.033
Jane.

10:33.066 --> 10:36.003
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, role-play as foreplay.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.271
So, where are you from?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.308
I'm a local, actually,
born and raised.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.143
What about you?
Well...

10:43.176 --> 10:45.345
Here and there. I don't
really have deep roots.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.817
Wait, is this about
what Mateo said

10:49.850 --> 10:52.152
about your parents?
Who's Mateo?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.321
Sorry.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.023
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Never mind.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.291
I'm kind of
a rolling stone.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.396
Okay, what?
Nothing.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.265
Look, I'm happy about
my decision not to find them.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.767
You just don't seem happy.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.301
Because you keep
asking me about it.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.938
Can I get
a scotch, neat?

11:12.940 --> 11:14.374
Please don't judge.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.309
I'm not.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.279
Fine, I am a little,

11:19.312 --> 11:20.413
but not because of the scotch,

11:20.447 --> 11:21.882
but because you
are shutting down

11:21.915 --> 11:23.316
and you do not want to engage.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.853
That's right, Jane. I don't.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.291
Should we do this
another night?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.961
Yeah. I have a big day
tomorrow with Petra.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.295
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

11:35.328 --> 11:37.898
We are almost completely out
of sea bass, Bob.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.067
Already?
Yes, and running out

11:40.100 --> 11:41.068
is unacceptable.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.169
Jane, write down that
that is unacceptable.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.840
Look, I need a shipment
no later than this afternoon,

11:46.874 --> 11:48.742
and if you can't do it,
I'll switch vendors.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.744
You don't think there are
other fishmongers in town?

11:50.778 --> 11:51.779
Please, Ms. Solano, I...

11:51.812 --> 11:52.746
Don't "please" me.
I just...

11:52.780 --> 11:54.314
I'm not the one
who made the mistake.
Hey,

11:54.347 --> 11:56.950
sorry to jump in, but I was
in the kitchen earlier,

11:56.984 --> 11:58.451
and we do have one pallet
of sea bass left.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.822
So we should be good
until tomorrow.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.190
Thank you for
your input, Jane.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.025
I'll check on it
and get back to you.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.794
You're dismissed.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.096
Jane!
Hmm?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.331
The first two letters
in shadow are shhh!

12:11.364 --> 12:13.066
I was just
trying to help.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.301
You weren't helping,
you were interfering.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.303
You think I don't know about
that extra pallet back there?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.872
Then why did you
threaten to fire him?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.040
To instill fear.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.109
Employees need to worry they're
going to lose their jobs.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.877
Keeps them on their toes.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.278
What?

12:25.312 --> 12:27.280
Nothing.
Oh, just say it.

12:28.816 --> 12:32.385
Fine, since you said
I was your moral compass.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.255
I just think there are kinder
ways to motivate your employees.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.424
Interesting.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.426
And how many successful
businesses have you run?

12:39.459 --> 12:40.928
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, snap!

12:40.961 --> 12:42.262
Exactly.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.530
Look, I can't have you shadow me

12:43.563 --> 12:45.398
if you're going to judge me
the whole time.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.935
Now I have to go.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.269
Going to that
parenting group

12:49.302 --> 12:50.938
was the best thing
I could have done.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.072
It was so helpful.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.373
Really?
Yes.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.375
There was this mom who
felt exactly like me.

12:55.408 --> 12:59.079
She loved her son, but she
didn't love taking care of him.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.581
See, I told you,
it's totally normal.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.216
Yes. I thought
I was struggling

13:03.250 --> 13:04.818
because I went from
being a famous person

13:04.852 --> 13:06.053
to a regular person,
you know,

13:06.086 --> 13:07.487
but everything
this mom said

13:07.520 --> 13:10.457
about postpartum depression
rang true.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.325
And then I realized I had it.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.426
What?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.328
Postpartum depression.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.297
You can't have
postpartum depression.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.598
Y-You didn't... partum.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.599
Pardon?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.201
You didn't give birth.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.302
I know, Xiomara,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.171
but what this mom said,

13:24.204 --> 13:25.372
I felt the exact same way,

13:25.405 --> 13:27.875
so I Googled male
postpartum depression

13:27.908 --> 13:29.309
during "Wheels on the Bus,"

13:29.342 --> 13:31.478
and men can
definitely have it, too.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.279
That's ridiculous.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.381
It has to do
with hormone levels.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.416
And I have hormones, too.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.052
And this birth
definitely affected them.

13:39.086 --> 13:42.055
So I'm not going to suffer
in silence.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.523
PETRA:
I don't understand.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.392
You said if I cooperated
with the police,

13:45.425 --> 13:46.493
then they would leave me alone.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.361
Why do they want
to question me again?

13:48.395 --> 13:49.762
Look, I'm surprised, too.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.899
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should
be noted she was not surprised

13:51.932 --> 13:53.633
because this bitch
was trying to frame Petra.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.003
They used the blueprints
to recreate the scene,

13:56.036 --> 13:57.270
and apparently,

13:57.304 --> 14:00.107
there were some screws missing
from Anezka's balcony railing,

14:00.140 --> 14:03.443
which would suggest
premeditation.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.415
They think I killed her
on purpose?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.417
Unfortunately, they're
not ruling it out.

14:11.618 --> 14:15.588
This is ridiculous.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.490
Clearly, my sister

14:17.524 --> 14:19.526
or my mother,
or some combination

14:19.559 --> 14:21.128
of the two were
trying to kill me.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.395
Then you say that
in the interview.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.497
Don't worry.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.135
All you have to do
is tell the truth.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.970
RAFAEL:
The truth is...

14:30.003 --> 14:33.506
I overreacted last night,
big-time.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.543
And I'm sorry.

14:36.576 --> 14:37.644
You were right.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.480
No, look, I...
I was thrown,

14:40.513 --> 14:43.450
I-I shut down,
I lashed out.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.952
And I should have
let it go, but...

14:44.985 --> 14:46.987
My grandma's coming.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.888
Um, rain check tomorrow
after work?
Mm-hmm.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.427
Wait, really?

14:54.461 --> 14:55.495
Who's Ronaldo?

14:55.528 --> 14:57.197
Her church crush. And?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.201
What do you mean you think?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.569
Either he asked you
or he didn't.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.178
Abuela...

15:14.247 --> 15:15.315
No. Cancel it.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.388
Uh...

15:21.421 --> 15:22.489
I have plans tomorrow night.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.128
What?

15:37.504 --> 15:38.938
Okay, I'll go.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.610
Get it, girl.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.251
PETRA: I have a lot of
interesting observations

15:51.284 --> 15:54.054
because I'm a very
perceptive person.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.089
PETRA :
I'll just make them up as we go,

15:56.123 --> 15:57.724
but definitely get across
that I'm observant.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.592
And I pick up on everything.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.329
Wow, this voice memo thing
is pretty great, actually.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.297
I can communicate
and not see you standing there,

16:04.331 --> 16:06.433
: judging me
with that judgy Jane face.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.202
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup, that's the face.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.603
PETRA:
Anyway...

16:10.637 --> 16:13.506
Oh... uh, Petra
made me voice memos

16:13.540 --> 16:15.075
because the shadow thing
wasn't working.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.482
Mm-hmm.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.386
PETRA: So that's why
lining up wallpaper precisely

16:26.419 --> 16:27.787
is important.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.090
Now, why did I bring that up?
I can't remember.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.392
I've lost my train of thought.
Well, eh, you'll find it.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.461
You have to demand what you want
in this world.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.496
You can't sit around
and wait to be handed it.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.331
Make big choices
because, otherwise, Ellie,

16:38.365 --> 16:39.799
Anna is going to walk
all over you.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.168
ELLIE:
Sorry, Mommy.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.502
PETRA:
Stop apologizing.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.171
Go get your ice cream
back from her.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.679
Essentially, it means if you
pat a snake with a bare foot,

16:52.712 --> 16:54.681
don't be surprised if someone
poops in your shoe.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.316
It may not translate.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.488
Okay, okay.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.823
PETRA:
Forget I said that.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.792
Oh, wow, I needed a break
from that voice.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.360
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Me, too.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.561
PETRA:
Well, I'm glad you're here.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.130
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, come on.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.798
It was ridiculously easy
for me to figure out.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.666
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, it's the real thing.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.734
I really should
be a detective.

17:14.767 --> 17:15.568
What are you talking about?

17:15.602 --> 17:18.105
The screws on
the Juliet balcony,

17:18.138 --> 17:19.606
they're called Mueller screws.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.608
You can't just unscrew them
with any old screwdriver.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.243
You need a Mueller screwdriver.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.512
The day Anezka died,
a Mueller screwdriver

17:25.545 --> 17:27.647
was signed out
and never returned.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.516
And guess who
signed it out?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.783
Go ahead,
show her, Vinnie.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.588
Your mother.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.458
VINNIE:
Yup.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.527
I remember when she came in
'cause she was with the twins.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.794
What?
Yeah.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.296
I remember 'cause
I can never tell

17:43.330 --> 17:44.831
which one is which,
and on that day,

17:44.864 --> 17:47.767
: I guessed right.
I was really relieved, actually.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.774
Petra

17:54.807 --> 17:58.745
Yeah, fine.
I just need a minute.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.388
Sorry.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.691
It's like it's
all just hitting me.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.594
My mother wanted me dead.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.729
And who knows when
she'll turn back up.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.667
And I'm just so tired, honestly,
of just having to...

18:20.700 --> 18:23.170
always be on my guard.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.606
But I have to.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.576
Because...
well, you heard.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.411
She was with
my daughters.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.281
How did she get to my daughters?

18:34.314 --> 18:36.616
I'm sorry.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.618
This isn't your problem.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.622
Yes, it is.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.759
And I'm gonna fix this.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.896
Let's rehearse what you're
gonna say to the police.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.898
I thought you said
we don't have to rehearse.

18:51.931 --> 18:55.635
Yeah, well...

18:55.668 --> 18:57.637
I changed my mind.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.687
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know, friends.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.756
Straight out of
a telenovela, right?

19:16.789 --> 19:18.625
Which brings us to...

19:23.830 --> 19:28.301
Wow, I'm getting
lots of replies.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.703
Eh... Not all of them are kind,

19:30.737 --> 19:32.839
but most aren't verified,

19:32.872 --> 19:34.274
so who cares, right?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.377
Oh, my God.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.413
Baby, I just got a reply
from River Fields.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.750
She's a major icon
with legendary eyebrows.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.796
Yes! This is big-league, Baby.
Let's see what she has to say.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.873
You back off with the
"momsplaining," River Fields.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.343
I agree with you, Baby.
She stinks.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.823
XIOMARA:
Hello,

20:23.856 --> 20:25.525
sexy lady.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.793
Oh, that's right.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.628
Have fun on your
date, Jane.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.340
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup. He saves babies.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.908
For a living.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.912
Abuela...

20:45.945 --> 20:47.914
Ooh, I want to see.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.316
ALBA:
Eh?

20:49.349 --> 20:51.451
Hello.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.019
Jane, he is fine.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.654
Okay, stop.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.764
Da, da, da! May I now present
an announcement

21:04.797 --> 21:06.933
from Papa
that will make everyone...

21:08.735 --> 21:09.736
What's my line again?

21:09.769 --> 21:10.770
ROGELIO:
"Faint."

21:10.803 --> 21:12.004
Faint!

21:12.038 --> 21:13.806
What?

21:15.074 --> 21:17.944
You are looking at a celebrity
who has been invited

21:17.977 --> 21:20.413
on The Talk
to debate River Fields

21:20.447 --> 21:23.916
on the topic
of male postpartum depression.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.318
Oh, no.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.919
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:26.953 --> 21:27.887
Rogelio, you can't.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.656
I can, and I will.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.923
Don't you remember
what happened

21:30.957 --> 21:32.759
when she took
down Tom Cruise?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.594
JANE: Yeah, Dad,
she's an American sweetheart.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.596
If something goes wrong,
you can ruin your chance

21:36.629 --> 21:37.830
at having an American career.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.802
Fine.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.471
I'll pass.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.840
Oh, look.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.442
River sent out another tweet.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.811
What do I think
about Rogelio de la Vega?

21:51.844 --> 21:53.112
Well, I, uh...

21:53.145 --> 21:55.948
I think he is a second-rate
telenovela actor

21:55.982 --> 21:57.850
who's spreading
ignorance online.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.987
The guy needs to keep his mouth
shut, stay in his lane.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.690
XIOMARA:
Rogelio...

22:03.723 --> 22:05.024
Calm down.

22:05.057 --> 22:05.958
No.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.059
I will not calm down.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.395
River Fields

22:08.428 --> 22:09.929
has no idea
what awaits her

22:09.962 --> 22:12.999
on The Talk because I am
going on the show.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.835
But I will not be talking.

22:15.868 --> 22:19.639
I will be yelling!

22:31.418 --> 22:33.686
You have to stop leading
with that, Abuelo.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.866
I didn't think he was.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.100
So, should we order?
CHRIS:
Sure.

22:48.134 --> 22:51.037
Let me grab
the waiter.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.440
WAITER:
So what can I get for you guys?

22:53.473 --> 22:56.443
ALBA: I'll have the salmon,
thank you.

22:56.476 --> 23:00.480
And I'll take the steak,
medium rare.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.915
Can I have the spinach with that
instead of the mushrooms?

23:02.949 --> 23:04.684
WAITER:
Certainly.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.520
And is the sauce on that spicy?

23:07.554 --> 23:10.490
A little, but we can
put it on the side.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.691
RONALDO:
No, I like spicy. Thank you.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.495
And actually,
I think I'll do...

23:15.528 --> 23:19.432
mashed potatoes
instead of spinach.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.668
Why not?

23:21.701 --> 23:22.835
WAITER:
For you, sir?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.036
CHRIS:
I'll take the chicken,

23:24.070 --> 23:26.072
please, with a side salad.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.441
WAITER: Very good.

23:28.475 --> 23:29.876
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Move your head!

23:29.909 --> 23:31.578
WAITER:
And for you?

23:31.611 --> 23:32.812
ALBA:
Jane?

23:32.845 --> 23:33.846
Huh?

23:33.880 --> 23:35.515
Uh...

23:35.548 --> 23:37.550
Oh, uh, um...

23:37.584 --> 23:39.686
I-I'll have the salmon.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.730
RAMOS :
Deep breath.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.765
They're just gonna ask
the same questions over and over

23:52.799 --> 23:54.567
to try to find inconsistencies.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.002
Just keep it simple.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.236
You got this.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.473
Just don't let them
rattle you.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.614
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

24:13.853 --> 24:15.254
You were great.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.023
Perfect, not rattled.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.758
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
True, for the record.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.494
I'd show you,
but it was pretty dry stuff.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.029
Hopefully, we'll get a call

24:23.062 --> 24:24.664
that you're no longer
a person of interest.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.633
And then,

24:26.666 --> 24:27.700
we go our separate ways.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.268
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hmm.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.971
Looks like someone's
having trouble letting go.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.874
Well, thank you, J.R.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.676
No problem.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.579
Pete.

24:39.612 --> 24:42.515
Did you just give my nickname
a nickname?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.160
NARRATOR:
Oh, no.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.062
Another burner phone?

24:56.095 --> 24:57.564
Where did that come from?

25:04.203 --> 25:06.238
CHRIS: I thought
they'd send me to jail.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.108
For stealing communion wine?

25:09.141 --> 25:10.777
I was 12. I had stolen
the blood of Christ.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.579
I was just hoping
they wouldn't crucify me.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.613
Oh.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.881
Hey.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.116
Huh?
It looks like they're
hitting it off, huh?

25:20.086 --> 25:22.154
That's why you're here,
too, right?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.623
Oh, totally.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.605
Do you need to check those?

25:38.638 --> 25:39.939
It could be your babysitter.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.273
No, it's not.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.575
RONALDO:
Well, that was the best meal

25:42.609 --> 25:43.776
I've had in ages.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.645
Huh?

25:45.678 --> 25:46.813
JANE:
Will you excuse me?

25:46.846 --> 25:48.114
I need to go
to the restroom.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.251
What are you doing?

25:52.284 --> 25:54.787
You stopped returning my texts.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.088
Are you seriously jealous?

25:56.122 --> 25:58.658
He was whispering in your ear.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.927
About how our grandparents
are having a good time.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.695
Come on.
Where is this coming from?

26:04.363 --> 26:06.699
It's coming from the fact
that I'll never be a Chris.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.234
A Catholic doctor?

26:08.267 --> 26:10.369
Uncomplicated. Light.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.204
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I mean,
way to generalize about Chris.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.206
I don't want you to be a Chris.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.208
I just want us to be able
to communicate.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.744
I want that, too.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.078
But I'm worried
that every time

26:19.111 --> 26:20.713
I get down about something,
every time I want

26:20.747 --> 26:22.381
to have a drink,
or I don't want to talk,

26:22.414 --> 26:24.050
you're gonna judge me.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.384
I've been walking
on eggshells around you.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.385
Honestly, I've been walking

26:26.418 --> 26:28.921
on eggshells around you, too,
trying not to be

26:28.955 --> 26:30.156
too judgy.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.628
You're right. I am.

26:42.234 --> 26:43.636
Ah.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.679
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's right, player.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.246
Alba's moving on, too.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.815
Right, Alba?

26:59.318 --> 27:00.720
Uh, Alba?

27:00.753 --> 27:03.122
Abuela? Are you
sure you're okay?

27:07.359 --> 27:08.828
Okay.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.763
Well, I'm gonna listen to Petra.

27:10.797 --> 27:14.033
She sent two more hours
of voice memos during dinner.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.002
Oof.
PETRA:
You have to be aggressive, Jane.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.236
No two ways about it.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.238
ALBA:
Oh, no.

27:19.271 --> 27:22.174
Abuela, are you okay?

27:27.714 --> 27:29.281
Abuela, it's just a teacup.

27:34.086 --> 27:37.690
Really?

27:40.760 --> 27:42.929
Why did you reject
his proposal?

27:42.962 --> 27:46.332
I still don't totally
understand what held you back.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.870
It's bigger in your mind.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.172
Once you say it,
it gets smaller.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.207
Well...

28:20.166 --> 28:22.168
It's like riding a bike.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.528
That's ridiculous.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.531
Yeah, you might be older, and
you might feel different

28:52.564 --> 28:56.368
and look different,
but you are not broken.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.838
Okay, you know what?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.506
Come on.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.478
Yes, you can, Abuela.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.393
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Am I
the only one getting hungry?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.962
Well, to each his own.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.077
Trust me, they use these, too.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.312
Now, I was doing a little
research while you were driving,

29:40.346 --> 29:41.413
and it looks like,

29:41.447 --> 29:42.548
as you age,

29:42.581 --> 29:44.016
your vagina gets dry.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.084
Jane!
Lubricant

29:45.117 --> 29:47.053
is all I'm saying. And...

29:47.086 --> 29:48.187
what about this?

29:49.421 --> 29:52.058
It stimulates
in two places.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.260
Okay, okay.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.361
We can go more basic.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.329
Hmm? And hot pink.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.065
Look, Abuela,
it's on sale.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.207
Well, then, I'm gonna buy it,

30:08.240 --> 30:10.342
because it's not embarrassing.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.544
I'll take this one.

30:12.578 --> 30:15.281
Okay. But heads-up,
it's not on sale anymore.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.183
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, Jane's instinct

30:17.216 --> 30:20.119
was to accept this, but a
little voice inside her said...

30:20.152 --> 30:22.188
PETRA: Don't let him walk
all over you, Jane.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.923
That is not acceptable.

30:23.956 --> 30:26.158
It was on the half-off rack,
so I want it half off.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.927
It must've been put there
by mistake.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.261
PETRA: He's just saying that
because he thinks

30:29.295 --> 30:30.462
you're weak and soft.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.898
There are half a dozen
other vibrators

30:31.931 --> 30:33.299
exactly like this one
on that rack.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.367
So, you telling me they were all
put there by mistake?

30:35.401 --> 30:38.570
Yup. It was one big
vibrator mistake.

30:38.604 --> 30:39.738
No discount.

30:39.771 --> 30:42.641
PETRA: "No" is only where
you start negotiating.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.443
If one of your employees
put that on the wrong rack,

30:44.476 --> 30:46.145
you have a management problem.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.080
And if you haven't changed
the sign, that's your problem,

30:48.114 --> 30:49.248
and you should pay for it.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.150
Lady...
Don't you "lady" me.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.085
If you don't give me
that discount, this lady

30:53.119 --> 30:56.022
is gonna leave here and Yelp
the crap out of this place.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.957
And I'm a professional writer,

30:57.990 --> 31:01.093
so I can make you sound
real bad. Hmm. Bart.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.028
Okay, okay.
Oh, and,

31:02.061 --> 31:04.163
you are going to comp me
my grandma's lube.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.100
You were right.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.201
I know.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.236
About what?

31:10.269 --> 31:11.904
It is important to be forceful

31:11.938 --> 31:13.472
and assertive
in regards to business.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.241
Which is why I need
to tell you something.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.077
These voice memos
are not working.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.079
This is not
how you ghostwrite a book.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.348
So you're saying
we should call it quits?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.383
No, I'm saying you need
to follow my lead.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.419
Business is your area of
expertise, writing is mine.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.088
We'll set up
twice-weekly

31:29.121 --> 31:30.422
two hour meetings, during which

31:30.456 --> 31:32.558
I will ask you
focused questions,

31:32.591 --> 31:34.660
in which you will provide
focused answers.

31:34.693 --> 31:38.030
Starting today,
right after my shift at 6:00.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.598
Meet me at my penthouse.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.600
Done. Good talk.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.035
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

31:43.069 --> 31:44.270
that brings us to...

31:47.173 --> 31:49.141
Our next two guests
recently got into

31:49.175 --> 31:52.444
a very public spat about
postpartum depression.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.147
I know, interesting topic,
right?

31:55.181 --> 31:57.984
Well, here's a father
who claims he has it.

31:58.017 --> 32:01.387
Please welcome
Rogelio de la Vega.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.357
Thank you, thank you,
Julie Chen.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.960
And thank you for having me
on your show to shine

32:07.994 --> 32:11.330
some much-needed celebrity light
on this, uh,

32:11.363 --> 32:13.265
overlooked cause.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.667
The cause being male
postpartum depression?

32:15.701 --> 32:17.603
That is right,
Sheryl Underwood, yes.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.338
SHARON:
All right,

32:19.371 --> 32:20.539
and on the other side
of this debate,

32:20.572 --> 32:22.508
one of our dear, dear friends,

32:22.541 --> 32:25.244
noted actress,
activist

32:25.277 --> 32:27.346
and all-around warrior woman.

32:27.379 --> 32:30.182
Please welcome back
River Fields.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.483
Stop.

32:34.553 --> 32:38.190
Yes, yes, stop bowing,
Sharon Osbourne.

32:38.224 --> 32:40.526
So, uh, what's
your take, River?

32:40.559 --> 32:42.561
Male postpartum depression--
is it a thing?

32:42.594 --> 32:45.331
No. I mean, obviously, it's not.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.665
Okay, it's not even close.

32:46.698 --> 32:49.001
ROGELIO: Well, men's
hormone levels drop, too.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.002
I'm sure they do.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.003
And-and I'm sure that

32:51.037 --> 32:52.338
you are feeling sad

32:52.371 --> 32:53.672
'cause your life
is changing.

32:53.705 --> 32:57.043
But you don't get
postpartum depression.

32:57.076 --> 33:00.012
Well, I-I know it's not
the same thing,

33:00.046 --> 33:02.514
you know, obviously,
but it-it's the same cause.

33:02.548 --> 33:05.217
I wonder, why are you
being so resistant?

33:05.251 --> 33:07.586
Why am I being resistant?

33:07.619 --> 33:11.357
Because you are yet
another male co-opting

33:11.390 --> 33:13.025
the female experience.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.426
You have everything.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.795
Leave postpartum depression
alone.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.265
Am I right, ladies?
Thank you.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.337
Are you okay?

33:25.371 --> 33:26.338
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.406
I'm so sorry, Julie Chen.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.674
I promised myself

33:28.707 --> 33:30.376
I wouldn't cry,
but, you know...

33:30.409 --> 33:32.611
'Cause men are expected to be,
like, so strong.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.314
Well, unfortunately,
that is all

33:35.347 --> 33:37.583
the time we have,
but after the break,

33:37.616 --> 33:39.185
we'll welcome
Dr. Evan Antin

33:39.218 --> 33:40.619
with some amazing

33:40.652 --> 33:42.388
exotic animals.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.790
That wasn't as bad
as I thought it would be.
Mm-hmm.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.158
MAN:
30 seconds to live.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.460
Nice touch
with the tears.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.262
But don't mess with
America's sweetheart,

33:50.296 --> 33:52.664
or I'll cut you
like a knife.

33:52.698 --> 33:53.765
MAN:
And we're live.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.335
Please welcome
Dr. Evan Antin

33:56.368 --> 33:59.238
and his friend Rajanya.

34:00.806 --> 34:03.542
Hi. Thank you so much
for having me.
So, Doctor,

34:03.575 --> 34:05.577
Rajanya's endangered,
right?

34:05.611 --> 34:07.346
That's correct.
You know, last year,

34:07.379 --> 34:09.715
in my role as
Greenpeace Ambassador,

34:09.748 --> 34:12.151
I got to visit
a wolf sanctuary.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.386
It was such
a moving experience.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.388
This is not your
segment, River.

34:16.422 --> 34:17.689
No, let Dr. Evan Antin

34:17.723 --> 34:18.757
have his moment.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.160
EVAN: So, Rajanya
responds really well

34:21.193 --> 34:23.229
to human commands,
but we need to remain calm,

34:23.262 --> 34:24.363
because we don't want
to excite him.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.631
He might look like
a little dog,

34:25.664 --> 34:27.299
but he's actually
a ferocious wild animal.

34:27.333 --> 34:30.236
Well, maybe he's just
mad because he has

34:30.269 --> 34:32.404
male postpartum
depression.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.709
You are as unfunny
as you are untalented.

34:37.743 --> 34:38.810
RIVER:
Please.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.312
I saw an episode

34:40.346 --> 34:41.380
of The Passions of Santos.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.814
How many hours a day

34:42.848 --> 34:44.416
do you have to exercise

34:44.450 --> 34:47.186
to digest all the
scenery that you chew?

34:47.219 --> 34:48.487
The Passions of Santos is
the most watched

34:48.520 --> 34:51.123
telenovela in history,
and I'm gonna bring it

34:51.157 --> 34:53.292
to the American audience
very, very soon.

34:54.526 --> 34:55.561
Let's take a breath,
shall we?

34:55.594 --> 34:56.762
EVAN:
That's right. Remember,

34:56.795 --> 34:58.197
we don't want to excite Rajanya.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.498
At least I still have a career.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.432
The last thing
I saw you in

35:00.466 --> 35:01.467
was a deodorant
commercial,

35:01.500 --> 35:03.435
and you stunk up my screen.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.405
I killed that commercial,
and you are just jealous

35:06.438 --> 35:08.507
because the only thing
you get paid to endorse

35:08.540 --> 35:10.276
is some Japanese
fart medicine!

35:10.309 --> 35:11.877
It's a laxative!

35:11.910 --> 35:13.912
And it's highly efficient
and respected

35:13.945 --> 35:15.414
in the medical circles.
Oh...

35:15.447 --> 35:16.882
Guys, seriously...
How dare you.

35:16.915 --> 35:19.385
How dare you!
How dare you!

35:19.418 --> 35:20.652
EVAN: Guys...
ROGELIO:
I didn't want to do this,

35:20.686 --> 35:22.421
but you leave me no choice.

35:22.454 --> 35:26.225
I'm calling on my 14 million
Twitter and Instagram followers.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.727
Go online and attack her!

35:38.570 --> 35:40.872
She hasn't heard
from Dad yet.

35:40.906 --> 35:41.907
I'm so sorry.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.644
Daddy, is that
a vibrating hot dog?

35:49.381 --> 35:50.516
I am so sorry.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.717
You said that you
were embarrassed,

35:51.750 --> 35:52.851
so I slipped it into
your purse last night.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.453
I thought you saw.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.824
Well, a part of you did,

35:58.857 --> 36:00.392
because you came
with me to the store.

36:00.426 --> 36:02.728
Abuela, I get it.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.730
It's uncomfortable for
you to talk about it,

36:04.763 --> 36:06.898
but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't try it.

36:13.239 --> 36:14.840
Is it?

36:14.873 --> 36:17.676
Or is that just what you
grew up hearing in the church?

36:17.709 --> 36:21.313
That sex wasn't about pleasure?
Because it should be.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.616
And you deserve
to be happy, Abuela,

36:24.650 --> 36:27.319
and in love.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.620
But you're never
gonna find that

36:28.654 --> 36:29.655
if you can't
overcome this.

36:31.423 --> 36:34.826
You can't just deny a
whole part of who you are.

36:37.363 --> 36:39.731
JANE:
And I can't deny who I am,

36:39.765 --> 36:41.733
and you can't, either,

36:41.767 --> 36:44.503
or this relationship
will never work.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.838
So, yeah, I'm judgy.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.575
In fact, I told you I was judgy
a few days after I met you.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.910
I'm judgy-- you should
know that about me.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.845
You may end up having
a really judgy kid.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.851
And I shut down
when things get hard.

36:59.885 --> 37:02.688
Which I showed you
pretty early, too.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.356
I just wasn't in a talking mood.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.326
And I'm definitely not
in the mood for a lecture.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.728
So it's part of who we are.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.763
Ah... and,

37:11.797 --> 37:13.799
this time, it's about
finding out if that works.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.967
So, on our next date,
I want you to go

37:16.001 --> 37:18.304
as dark as you want,
and I'm gonna get

37:18.337 --> 37:19.771
as judgy as I want,

37:19.805 --> 37:23.742
and then we're gonna have
dark, judgmental sex.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.777
I am so in.

37:25.811 --> 37:29.615
And just to get a head start
on that judginess...

37:29.648 --> 37:32.518
I think you should look
for your birth parents.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.753
Because for the last
three years,

37:34.786 --> 37:36.655
every time it comes up,
you've reacted like this.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.958
So, obviously,
it's bothering you.

37:39.991 --> 37:43.061
And as a person who
was missing a parent

37:43.094 --> 37:45.931
for most of my life,
I can tell you that

37:45.964 --> 37:48.634
that question
doesn't go away.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.902
ROGELIO: This is never
going to go away.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.671
Over five million views.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.072
River lost one toe.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.842
One! She has nine more.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.378
I told you not to take her on.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.347
It's my agent.

38:02.581 --> 38:05.317
Talk to me, Barry.

38:05.351 --> 38:08.920
Yes, yes, but it's not
like how it looked.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.057
Oh. Mm-hmm.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.993
Mm-hmm. Yes.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.496
I understand. Bye.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.432
What'd he say?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.969
The studio just offered
to green-light

38:24.002 --> 38:25.871
the American version of Santos.

38:25.904 --> 38:26.938
What?

38:26.972 --> 38:29.074
If I can get River Fields

38:29.107 --> 38:30.976
to costar with me.

38:31.009 --> 38:36.882
It seems that our chemistry
was electric on The Talk.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.584
How can you even talk
on this thing?
I'm a multitasker.

38:38.617 --> 38:39.951
Always have been.
This way, I get to

38:39.985 --> 38:40.986
test the machines,
meet with you,

38:41.019 --> 38:42.821
and get my cardio out
of the way all at once.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.022
Any more questions?
Uh, just...

38:44.055 --> 38:45.624
a few last ones.

38:45.657 --> 38:49.027
Uh, ironing out timelines.
Whoa...

38:49.060 --> 38:52.764
Uh, you came to Miami
in 2007?
Exactly.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.900
But do not print my age.
Okay.

38:54.933 --> 38:57.569
Oh, good,
we're done stepping.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.070
Ah... whew!

38:59.104 --> 39:00.739
No, we're not done.
We're just switching.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.073
Huh?
Hotel's buying
20 of these.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.442
I want to get the right one.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.943
But isn't it exhausting?

39:04.976 --> 39:06.712
You just have to
build up your stamina.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.747
Let's wrap it up; I have
to review purchase orders.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.583
I mean being the boss and making
the decisions all the time.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.585
Being in charge comes
very naturally to me.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.722
I know, uh, but, I mean,
is there anywhere

39:16.755 --> 39:19.491
you can, you know, relax?

39:19.525 --> 39:22.894
All right, off the record...

39:22.928 --> 39:24.530
Uh-huh.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.565
Sex.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.034
I let go in bed.
I like to submit.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.403
To be dominated.
That's why Rafael

39:31.437 --> 39:34.072
and I got along
so well.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.907
Oh, okay. Cool.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.976
He's a beast under
the covers.

39:38.009 --> 39:40.078
Or out of the covers.
Mm.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.180
I mean, that man really
knows how to please a woman.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.517
Wow, that's fantastic.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.052
Okay, yeah,
we're good here.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.854
I have to...
I'm gonna...

39:48.887 --> 39:51.089
I'm gonna go write.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.925
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

39:53.959 --> 39:55.060
Can we have sex already?

39:55.093 --> 39:58.764
I'm ready right now.
Let's do it.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.766
Sure.

40:00.799 --> 40:03.068
Right after the cable
is installed.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.643
I'm gonna hop in the shower.
I-I just worked out.

40:11.677 --> 40:13.078
HBO part of the package?

40:13.111 --> 40:15.881
Cool, cool.
I mean, I love a...

40:15.914 --> 40:17.616
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Don't say it, Jane.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.785
...full package.

40:30.796 --> 40:31.963
J.R.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.999
I wasn't expecting you.
Sorry, I'm...

40:34.032 --> 40:35.767
I'm not dressed.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.135
I have an update
from the D.A.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.137
Looks like I got you off.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.973
Really?

40:43.642 --> 40:44.810
Yeah.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.846
* In the dark, in the night

40:47.879 --> 40:50.516
* Senses wake, I'm alive...

40:50.549 --> 40:52.050
Now I'm really gonna
get you off.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.520
* Too deep

40:56.254 --> 40:58.990
* It's unclear
which one here... *

40:59.024 --> 41:00.258
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whoa, that's one kind

41:00.291 --> 41:01.860
of sexual awakening.

41:01.893 --> 41:06.031
* When the hunger
takes over me *

41:10.636 --> 41:13.171
* Got my finger on the trigger

41:13.204 --> 41:15.240
* And my target set on you

41:15.273 --> 41:16.908
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And this is another.

41:16.942 --> 41:19.244
* Set it off, I get off,
yeah, yeah *

41:19.277 --> 41:21.513
* I am coming for you

41:21.547 --> 41:24.182
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know, steamy stuff.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.151
* When my hands are on you...

41:26.184 --> 41:27.919
Cable guy's gone.

41:27.953 --> 41:30.121
* I'm coming for you

41:30.155 --> 41:32.791
* And you, and you, and you

41:32.824 --> 41:36.027
* And you, and you
and you, and you *

41:36.061 --> 41:38.029
* And you, too,
and you, too *

41:38.063 --> 41:40.899
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on,
I can't show you everything.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.033
We're not on HBO.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.736
