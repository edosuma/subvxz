with my patients earlier,

on their conditions.

This is a trauma,
not a transplant surgery.

And I understand that you have
a lot on your plate right now,

23:49.515 --> 23:51.691

it's important that I share

23:51.734 --> 23:53.040
this conversation with you.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.563
both: Okay.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.870
- So--so what
he told us is that

23:56.913 --> 23:59.699
he provoked Ryan
into this outburst today.

23:59.742 --> 24:00.961
He feels terrible.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.963
I think he is looking
for some attention.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.922
But where Ryan's concerned--
what this means to me

24:05.966 --> 24:08.664
is that it wasn't
an impulsive outburst.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.188
It wasn't--it wasn't random.

24:11.232 --> 24:15.497
And that and a couple other
things I've observed today

24:15.541 --> 24:17.717
are leading me to believe
it's very possible

24:17.760 --> 24:20.676
that--that your son has
been misdiagnosed with ADHD

24:20.720 --> 24:22.548
and that we were
probably looking

24:22.591 --> 24:24.724
at some kind
of anxiety disorder instead.

24:24.767 --> 24:25.899
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.596
Look at him.
He can't sit still.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.251
- But Mr. Miller,
it's--it's the counting, right?

24:30.294 --> 24:31.644
The tapping.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.210
I think that
he's self-soothing

24:33.254 --> 24:35.735
to help him cope
with these feelings of anxiety.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.084
And when that stops working,

24:37.127 --> 24:39.173
I think he feels
backed into a corner,

24:39.216 --> 24:41.915
and then you have
a fight-or-flight situation.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.525
- Well, what
about the Adderall?

24:43.569 --> 24:44.787
His doctor said
that would help.

24:44.831 --> 24:48.617
- If he actually had ADHD,
it would be working.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.751
But it's not, right?
I think that in Ryan's case,

24:51.794 --> 24:53.274
it's actually working
against him

24:53.317 --> 24:55.755
and serving to only intensify
these feelings of anxiety

24:55.798 --> 24:57.278
to the point
where they're often,

24:57.321 --> 24:58.801

But I just wouldn't

25:10.073 --> 25:11.640
be doing my job
if I didn't tell you

25:11.684 --> 25:13.947
how important I think
it would be to reassess Ryan

25:13.990 --> 25:16.558
and make sure that you are
looking at the right diagnosis

25:16.602 --> 25:19.126

for all of you,

25:19.169 --> 25:21.955

25:27.917 --> 25:30.050

- Okay.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.884

It wasn't my place.
I'm sorry.

the Vas-COM after all.

we're looking at this wrong?

25:53.247 --> 25:55.597
That she doesn't even have
a clotting disorder?

25:55.641 --> 25:59.906

It's just so little to go on.

eosinophils,

Churg-Strauss?
