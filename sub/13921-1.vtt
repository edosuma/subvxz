01:27:25.951 --> 01:27:27.035
Help me.

<i>I don't think I'll ever get back!</i>

01:27:35.085 --> 01:27:38.004
<i>Beth! Beth!</i>

01:27:39.047 --> 01:27:40.507
<i>Beth, I'm talking to you!</i>

01:27:40.715 --> 01:27:42.008
Tell me what to do!

01:27:42.175 --> 01:27:43.677
I can't--

01:27:43.844 --> 01:27:45.178
I can't breathe here!

01:27:45.387 --> 01:27:47.347
Hey, watch out for that rock.

01:27:47.848 --> 01:27:51.143
It's me, Harry.
Just come around the rock.

01:27:51.393 --> 01:27:53.603
Go to the right of the stanchion.

01:27:53.937 --> 01:27:55.814
Tell me what to do, Harry. I'm hurting.

01:27:56.314 --> 01:27:57.649
Come around which way?

01:27:57.816 --> 01:27:58.859
[COUGHS]

01:27:59.192 --> 01:28:00.485
I can't breathe, Harry!

01:28:00.861 --> 01:28:02.195
Yes, you can breathe.

01:28:02.362 --> 01:28:06.032
You just have a faulty valve.
it won't kill you. You got plenty of gas.

01:28:06.283 --> 01:28:07.701
<i>I can't tell which way I'm going!</i>

01:28:07.951 --> 01:28:10.412
See the air lock? Right in front of you.

01:28:10.579 --> 01:28:14.166
<i>I can't-- I can't bear
the feeling in my ears!</i>

01:28:14.499 --> 01:28:17.335
NORMAN:
And I can't breathe. Please.

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.549
[NORMAN YELLING]

01:28:40.567 --> 01:28:42.402
NORMAN: Where is she?
HARRY: Slow your breathing.

01:28:42.569 --> 01:28:45.906
- You'll hyperventilate.
-She said she'd keep an eye out.

01:28:46.239 --> 01:28:49.326
HARRY: I looked all over the habitat for her.
I thought she was with you.

01:28:49.576 --> 01:28:51.828
[NORMAN COUGHING]

01:28:51.995 --> 01:28:53.413
NORMAN:
Where is she?

01:28:54.039 --> 01:28:55.081
Where is she?!

01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:07.052
- Did she tell you she was going out?
-No.

01:29:08.094 --> 01:29:09.971
NORMAN: Beth?
BETH: Norman?

01:29:10.138 --> 01:29:11.556
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

01:29:11.806 --> 01:29:13.350
If she can't hear, Why'd she answer?

01:29:13.558 --> 01:29:14.809
Beth, what are you doing?

01:29:14.976 --> 01:29:17.437
<i>I went out looking for food.
We're out of food.</i>

01:29:18.188 --> 01:29:21.483
I was just up there. Stuff all over,
but there's plenty of food.

01:29:21.733 --> 01:29:25.278
You went to look for food in the spacecraft.
That seems a little odd.

01:29:25.445 --> 01:29:27.030
<i>No. What seems odd about it?</i>

01:29:27.697 --> 01:29:30.867
Even if there was food,
wouldn't it be at least 300 years old?

01:29:31.201 --> 01:29:33.745
<i>I was hoping for a cryogenic freezer,
you know?</i>

01:29:34.079 --> 01:29:35.956
Maybe a bottle of Bordeaux.

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.000
She's lying.
She's lying about everything.

01:29:39.626 --> 01:29:41.461
Is Harry up there with you?

01:29:46.132 --> 01:29:49.553
Why don't we talk when you get back?
Meet me in the galley.

01:29:49.803 --> 01:29:53.223
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
There's still coffee, isn't there?

01:29:53.557 --> 01:29:57.435
<i>Very funny. I'll take mine black,
like my mood.</i>

01:29:57.686 --> 01:29:59.396
NORMAN:
All right. See you soon.

01:30:01.314 --> 01:30:05.402
We got two ingredients here:
Beth and this underwater environment.

01:30:05.652 --> 01:30:08.905
Put them together,
you got one big-ass bomb.

01:30:14.869 --> 01:30:16.955
HARRY: Good thing for you
I came by when I did.

01:30:17.122 --> 01:30:18.456
Hey)'-

01:30:18.623 --> 01:30:20.333
How did it go in the mini-sub?

01:30:20.792 --> 01:30:22.627
It was a little disconcerting
out there, actually.

01:30:22.794 --> 01:30:24.337
- Oh?
-Yeah.

01:30:24.504 --> 01:30:26.840
Weren't you supposed to be watching me
from the control room?

01:30:27.007 --> 01:30:28.425
Yeah, but...

01:30:28.675 --> 01:30:32.762
...Harry said he'd take over for me.
You sat down at the monitors.

[SCOFFS]

01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:36.433
What happened?

01:30:37.601 --> 01:30:38.893
I was in trouble.

01:30:39.144 --> 01:30:40.145
Where were you?

01:30:43.148 --> 01:30:45.483
- What's going on?
NORMAN: "What's going on?"

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:49.029
Going out to look for 300-year-old food
in that spaceship...

01:30:49.279 --> 01:30:52.282
...when there's plenty of food here
isn't exactly normal.

01:30:52.616 --> 01:30:53.867
"Plenty of food"?

01:30:54.117 --> 01:30:55.910
There isn't any...

01:31:00.957 --> 01:31:02.042
HARRY:
Ta-da!

01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:03.877
A veritable horn of plenty.

01:31:16.473 --> 01:31:17.474
He must have hidden it.

01:31:17.682 --> 01:31:19.643
You think I hid all that food?

01:31:20.352 --> 01:31:21.728
I don't know what's going on.

01:31:23.104 --> 01:31:24.731
I was standing...

01:31:24.898 --> 01:31:26.274
I was standing right here.

01:31:26.858 --> 01:31:29.027
And there was no food in the cupboards.

01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:33.948
And there was no food in the fridge.

01:31:34.199 --> 01:31:35.241
Why, Beth?

01:31:35.408 --> 01:31:38.078
Why would Harry do that?
Why would he set you up?

01:31:38.411 --> 01:31:40.038
I don't know.

01:31:40.246 --> 01:31:41.706
Norman, I just...

01:31:41.873 --> 01:31:42.916
NORMAN:
You don't know?

01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:44.501
I'm telling you...

01:31:44.751 --> 01:31:46.586
...I was standing here...

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.755
...and this food was not here!

01:31:49.047 --> 01:31:52.717
Calling Dr. Halperin. Dr. Beth Halperin.
Please return to reality.

01:31:53.093 --> 01:31:54.469
Shut up.

01:31:54.803 --> 01:31:56.596
Okay, you can see
what he's doing to me.

01:31:56.846 --> 01:31:58.723
NORMAN:
You said you'd watch me. You didn't.

01:31:58.973 --> 01:32:00.767
You think Harry
said something he didn't...

01:32:01.017 --> 01:32:02.727
...that cupboards are empty
when they're full.

01:32:02.977 --> 01:32:06.690
Clinically, we would call that
evidence of a psychotic break.

01:32:07.065 --> 01:32:08.608
I am not crazy, Norman!

01:32:09.526 --> 01:32:11.528
You gonna write me a prescription?

01:32:11.778 --> 01:32:15.949
And just get rid of me again?
It's not that convenient down here!

01:32:16.199 --> 01:32:17.450
I am not psychotic!

01:32:17.742 --> 01:32:19.077
How about a mini-psychotic break?

01:32:19.285 --> 01:32:20.412
- That's not fair.
-Beth!

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.122
- What?
-I'm down there.

01:32:22.288 --> 01:32:25.959
I can't breathe. I'm hyperventilating.
The man saved me.

01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:27.544
- But I--
NORMAN: Wait a minute!

01:32:27.794 --> 01:32:30.255
You want me to believe
that he set you up! Why?

01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:32.465
<i>This isn't Alice In Wonderland!</i>

01:32:32.674 --> 01:32:34.592
Remember, "just you and me, babe"?

01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:37.929
Is it unrealistic to think
that at this point...

01:32:38.179 --> 01:32:41.224
...you are a danger to yourself,
you are a danger to all of us...

01:32:41.599 --> 01:32:45.895
...because of your anger toward me,
which happened 10 or 15 years ago...

01:32:46.146 --> 01:32:47.856
...which is so distorted in your head!

01:32:48.648 --> 01:32:49.691
I was out there.

01:32:49.899 --> 01:32:51.651
You almost got me killed!

01:32:51.943 --> 01:32:55.613
The man tried to save my life!
You now want me to disbelieve Harry?!

01:32:55.864 --> 01:32:59.075
Yes, I want you to disbelieve Harry!
I want you...

01:32:59.325 --> 01:33:02.495
...to look at me and believe me
for one time, Norman.

01:33:02.996 --> 01:33:04.247
Don't you--?

01:33:04.414 --> 01:33:06.249
Look at me.
Am I telling you the truth?

01:33:06.458 --> 01:33:07.625
You weren't there.

01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:13.506
You want to believe Harry,
then that's fine, okay?

01:33:13.673 --> 01:33:17.177
Because he's done everything but part
the sea for you since we've been here.

01:33:17.427 --> 01:33:18.803
Okay?

01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:20.764
But I'm telling you...

01:33:21.139 --> 01:33:22.682
...that he is not...

01:33:22.932 --> 01:33:25.059
...telling you the truth.

01:33:25.435 --> 01:33:26.936
This is not about Harry.

01:33:27.979 --> 01:33:29.439
Is it?

01:33:30.482 --> 01:33:31.983
Who's this about?

01:33:34.194 --> 01:33:37.113
He didn't tell you what's
inside the sphere, did he?

01:33:38.281 --> 01:33:41.910
You didn't tell him
what's inside the sphere.

01:33:43.203 --> 01:33:45.872
And how would you know that, Beth?

01:33:51.252 --> 01:33:53.296
Did you go inside the sphere?

01:33:56.716 --> 01:33:59.052
Answer me.
Did you go inside the sphere?

01:34:03.598 --> 01:34:05.433
Why won't you answer me, Beth?

01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:10.313
It's a question.

01:34:10.563 --> 01:34:12.440
You don't want to talk to me.

01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:13.900
Remember?

01:34:15.276 --> 01:34:17.403
NORMAN:
Answer a question.

01:34:21.741 --> 01:34:23.660
What do you think, Harry?

01:34:24.869 --> 01:34:26.913
You think she went in the sphere?

01:34:38.758 --> 01:34:39.926
Here.

01:34:40.301 --> 01:34:42.011
You dropped your book.

01:36:14.354 --> 01:36:15.897
NORMAN:
Jerry.

01:36:16.606 --> 01:36:18.232
What isn't Harry telling me?

01:36:18.858 --> 01:36:21.319
Jerry, I know you're there.
You're always there.

01:36:23.196 --> 01:36:25.698
What's inside the sphere, Jerry?

01:36:26.532 --> 01:36:28.952
Harry is reading this book...

01:36:29.327 --> 01:36:31.621
<i>...Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea.</i>

01:36:32.288 --> 01:36:34.999
What makes me nervous
is that after page...

01:36:35.249 --> 01:36:36.918
...87...

01:36:41.714 --> 01:36:43.716
...it's all blank pages.

01:36:47.971 --> 01:36:49.138
Why?

01:36:51.391 --> 01:36:53.601
Why did he go into the sphere...

01:36:57.063 --> 01:36:58.940
...and come out like this? Why?

01:36:59.315 --> 01:37:00.775
Why? Why, Jerry?

01:37:01.067 --> 01:37:03.111
Why is this book half a book, Jerry?

01:37:04.112 --> 01:37:05.321
Why? Why?

01:37:05.655 --> 01:37:07.240
What's going on?

01:37:12.745 --> 01:37:15.832
NORMAN:
He's got G equals one.

01:37:15.999 --> 01:37:17.875
That's right.

01:37:18.167 --> 01:37:21.754
He's got B equals two.

01:37:21.921 --> 01:37:23.506
Uh-huh.

01:37:23.673 --> 01:37:24.882
He's got...

01:37:25.091 --> 01:37:27.135
...H equals three.

01:37:28.136 --> 01:37:29.429
That's not right.

01:37:29.929 --> 01:37:31.973
Harry's got the code wrong.

01:37:32.223 --> 01:37:34.517
H doesn't equal three.

01:38:55.348 --> 01:38:58.726
NORMAN: Harry not only makes it real
for himself, Beth.

01:38:58.976 --> 01:39:01.437
He makes it real for you.
He makes it real for me.

01:39:01.687 --> 01:39:04.065
He has made it real for everybody.

01:39:04.357 --> 01:39:08.569
It's really frightening because you
don't know whether it's really real...

01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:13.366
...or whether he's made it real
for us to believe it's real.

01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:16.452
And it's because of the sphere.

01:39:18.204 --> 01:39:19.622
BETH:
Our Harry?

01:39:19.789 --> 01:39:21.749
Our Harry is Jerry?

01:39:21.999 --> 01:39:25.211
NORMAN: Come on, Beth,
I'm just as tired as you are.

01:39:25.378 --> 01:39:28.214
I know you can get this. Okay?

01:39:29.382 --> 01:39:34.387
Harry said he couldn't get past page 87
because he said it was too scary.

01:39:34.762 --> 01:39:36.848
There's nothing on the pages.
Where's the rest?

01:39:37.265 --> 01:39:38.933
Read what's on page 87.

01:39:40.393 --> 01:39:42.603
"According to calculations
of some naturalists...

01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:47.150
...one of these animals, only 6 feet long,
would have tentacles <i>27</i> feet long.

01:39:47.859 --> 01:39:49.944
That would make a formidable monster."

01:39:50.695 --> 01:39:52.280
What does Harry hate?

01:39:52.822 --> 01:39:54.240
Squid.

01:39:54.615 --> 01:39:56.659
And when he read that, it scared him.

01:39:57.493 --> 01:39:58.911
Getting the picture?

01:39:59.328 --> 01:40:01.122
Remember all those...

01:40:01.289 --> 01:40:03.124
...jellyfish that attacked, right?

01:40:03.291 --> 01:40:05.334
What was Harry doing then?

01:40:05.501 --> 01:40:06.586
BETH:
Sleeping.

01:40:06.752 --> 01:40:08.254
He was dreaming.

01:40:09.714 --> 01:40:12.258
And this is the really wild part:

01:40:12.925 --> 01:40:15.052
- What he dreamed...
-Happened?

01:40:15.344 --> 01:40:17.096
- It happened.
-Uh-huh.

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.974
You're telling me that...

01:40:20.224 --> 01:40:24.604
...because Harry went inside the sphere,
he now has the power to manifest...

01:40:24.854 --> 01:40:27.607
...his dreams, his fantasies...

01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.775
Manifest. He manifested it.

01:40:30.026 --> 01:40:31.277
He made it happen.

01:40:31.527 --> 01:40:32.945
We better not piss him off.

01:40:33.154 --> 01:40:35.990
It's not that different from a child, right?

01:40:36.157 --> 01:40:39.744
A child imagines that
what it's imagining happens.

01:40:39.994 --> 01:40:41.120
But it doesn't.
