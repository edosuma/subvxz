WEBVTT

00:32.133 --> 00:34.768
* I never wanted another *

00:36.637 --> 00:40.408
* Come over to me
and discover *

00:42.476 --> 00:45.779
* I want to be near you *

00:47.681 --> 00:51.519
* And you need to be far away *

00:53.154 --> 00:57.958
* You always seem
to make me feel at home *

00:58.025 --> 00:59.693
Thanks. I mean, merci.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.466
* I never know,
I never know *

01:05.533 --> 01:10.138
*I never know,
I never know why *

01:10.204 --> 01:11.372
* Forever live and die *

01:11.439 --> 01:13.541
- This place is amazing.
- Thanks!

01:13.607 --> 01:16.544
- I love it!
- What happened
to your roommate?

01:16.610 --> 01:19.147
She fell in love with
her dance teacher
and moved out.

01:19.147 --> 01:22.916
I thought about getting
another one, but...

01:22.983 --> 01:24.852
you know, I like the quiet.

01:24.918 --> 01:29.056
And I figured a spare room
might come in handy.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.559
So is that where I'm sleeping?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.594
If you're bad.

01:35.563 --> 01:39.300
Wow. These are really good.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.635
- You think so?
- Yeah.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.371
Not that you weren't good
before, but...

01:43.437 --> 01:45.273
these are really something.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.475
It's hard not to be
inspired here.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.817
What's this?

01:56.884 --> 02:00.254
It's just a little something
I saw in a shop window

02:00.321 --> 02:02.723
on the Rue Saint-HonorÃ©,

02:02.790 --> 02:04.325
like months ago.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.595
- Wow.
- I knew your old one
had broken.

02:07.661 --> 02:12.800
and I thought you could use it
to document your visit,

02:12.866 --> 02:14.235
like a journal.

02:16.103 --> 02:19.840
Now I feel like a total jerk.
I didn't bring you anything.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.211
It's not true.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.248
**

02:39.693 --> 02:41.862
And that's what's so amazing
about the French,

02:41.929 --> 02:44.097
they have this completely
different attitude towards life.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.500
What do you mean?

02:46.567 --> 02:49.370
Work is not the center
of their lives.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.472
It's sharing a bottle
of wine at lunch,

02:51.539 --> 02:54.875
or-- or lingering over
a meal with friends

02:54.942 --> 02:56.610
until way past midnight,

02:56.677 --> 02:58.512
or making love
in the morning,

02:58.579 --> 03:01.249
even if it means being
late to the office.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.651
But is that everyone,
or just your average
French office worker?

03:03.717 --> 03:05.619
- What do you mean?
- Well, it sounds awesome.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.688
I just wonder if you can
stay up all night,
drink wine at lunch,

03:07.755 --> 03:09.557
and still be a great artist
or write an amazing novel.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.660
Sometimes I wonder
if that is not the whole point.

03:12.726 --> 03:16.697
It's not the paintings
that you leave behind

03:16.764 --> 03:18.532
that are important,
it's how you lived.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.934
Like this,
what we're doing right now.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.670
This is the real canvas.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.007
All right,
is the water boiling?

03:27.074 --> 03:29.610
- Yep.
- Do you wanna
hand me the snails?

03:29.677 --> 03:31.279
Hi.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.817
- Thank you.
- Shit, some of them got out.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.620
- They're making a break for it?
- Yeah.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.622
I don't really
wanna touch them.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.592
It's like the lobsters
in Annie Hall, only slower.

03:44.658 --> 03:48.929
Oh, kiss me, David.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.498
Mm-hmm.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.604
Have things gotten
any better at school?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.138
No.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.941
It's so crazy that they don't
offer any film classes.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.311
Well, it's community college.
It's for people who wanna become

04:03.377 --> 04:05.313
computer programmers
or paralegals.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.582
Only thing they offer
is a class in TV production
for Communication majors.

04:08.649 --> 04:12.520
But, fuck,
who wants to work in TV?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.655
I think you'd make
a cute paralegal.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.457
I would look terrible
in a skirt.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.326
- I have "knobbly" knees.
- Oh, no you don't.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.793
They're here.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.390
We went to Montmartre today
to see Truffaut's grave.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.861
You like Jules et Jim?

04:53.927 --> 04:54.928
Oh, it's the best.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.734
I love that it has a narrator.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.035
Uh, you know, not voiceover,

05:02.102 --> 05:03.637
but someone actually
telling the story,

05:03.704 --> 05:05.238
who knows everything
about the characters--

05:05.373 --> 05:06.774
what they're thinking
and feeling,

05:06.840 --> 05:08.742
and even stuff they don't
know about themselves,

05:08.809 --> 05:11.512
which is ironic 'cause Jules
and Jim and this girl Catherine

05:11.579 --> 05:14.648
that they both love,
they've been living
lives of total freedom

05:14.715 --> 05:19.252
from convention and morality,
and that that's gonna keep them
young and happy forever.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.722
But they're not.
And it doesn't.

05:25.393 --> 05:30.398
Sorry. My English, it's,um...

05:30.398 --> 05:31.532
not very good.

05:51.419 --> 05:55.756
- You ever get homesick?
- For New Jersey?

05:55.823 --> 05:58.659
How often do you talk
to your folks.

05:58.726 --> 06:02.530
My father calls about
every week from his work

06:02.596 --> 06:05.433
to yell at me about
how much I'm charging
to his credit card.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.936
But overall, we're
getting along much better.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.506
I think it's healthier for us
to have an ocean between us.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.008
How's your father?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.077
Not great.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.580
He's still pretty bummed
about having to close
his accounting business.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.281
Did he find a new job?

06:21.348 --> 06:22.616
Not yet.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.017
It must be hard for him,

06:24.084 --> 06:27.320
having to try to find work
at his age.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.322
I think most things are hard for
my father

06:29.457 --> 06:30.858
He's just one of those people

06:30.924 --> 06:33.060
who doesn't seem capable
of being happy.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.662
It's funny.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.929
What is?

06:35.996 --> 06:37.931
How we're nothing
like our parents.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.801
Yeah.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.839
Let's go.

06:45.906 --> 06:50.611
Why are you making
that weird face?

06:50.678 --> 06:52.480
- I'm concentrating.
- On what?

06:52.513 --> 06:53.647
Not getting a boner.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.717
Say something to distract me.

06:56.784 --> 07:01.321
Um, when do Bergen Community's
winter sessions start?

07:01.388 --> 07:03.624
Next week.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.959
Are there any classes
you're even a little
interested in taking?

07:06.026 --> 07:09.196
- Not really.
- You wanna make movies, right?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.198
- Yeah.
- So make them.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.734
It's not that easy.
There's a ton you have to learn.

07:13.801 --> 07:17.370
And it's expensive.
You need cameras, film stock,
sound equipment, lights.

07:17.505 --> 07:20.207
With a film program like NYU,
you can borrow that stuff,

07:20.273 --> 07:23.376
but it's pretty much impossible
to do on your own.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.547
It's not like being a painter
or a writer, where all you
need is paper.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.185
I just hate to see you
give up on a dream.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.689
- Our Indian food.
- I'll get it.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.058
Don't move a muscle.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.229
Surprise!

07:44.431 --> 07:46.033
My darling! Mwah!

07:47.267 --> 07:48.936
I told you we should
have called you first.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.938
What are you guys doing here?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.574
We're gonna let our baby girl
be alone on New Year's Eve?

07:53.641 --> 07:55.442
How are you even allowed
to leave the country?

07:55.543 --> 07:57.645
What? I'm innocent
till proven guilty.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.248
And I'm not gonna be proven
anything, because it's
a bullshit case.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.084
And that rodeo clown Giuliani,
he knows that, so don't even
get me started.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.853
The judge didn't put
any travel restrictions
on your father's bail.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.254
Go wherever I wanna go.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.822
So you guys came straight
from the airport?

08:08.889 --> 08:11.158
Hello! Look at this.
I'm such a mess.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.326
Your father was so excited
to surprise you, he's
just like a little kid.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.564
- Surprise!
- How long have you guys been
planning this?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.365
- No plans.
- Spur of the moment.
Just like that.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.567
We used to do this all time.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.068
Before you,
when we were dating,

08:21.134 --> 08:23.671
we would just do that, we'd
pick up and go anytime we want.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.574
- Take a tooth brush.
- Thank God we got
a room at the Bristol.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.709
That's a lot of luggage
for just toothbrushes.

08:28.776 --> 08:29.977
How long are you staying
exactly?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.411
I don't even know.
Give us the tour.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.046
Uh, wait.

08:33.113 --> 08:37.017
- Wow, look at this.
- Are you eating?
You look very thin.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.119
- Oh, my God.
Look at this place.
- Jesus Christ.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.955
- Darling, this is adorable.
- Oh, it kind of reminds me

08:42.022 --> 08:43.591
of the place we had
on the Upper West Side.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.593
Yeah, except we had elevators.

08:45.626 --> 08:49.062
I love these old buildings.
You can almost smell the
history.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.599
- That's paint fumes.
- Speaking of which--

08:51.599 --> 08:54.902
Let's see how those expensive
art lessons are coming along.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.171
How are we doing.
All righty.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.642
Look at that.
Isn't that something?

09:01.709 --> 09:06.479
Oh, okay. Very nice.
Very nice job, sweetheart.

09:06.614 --> 09:10.117
I can't speak
to the likeness of it,

09:10.183 --> 09:14.187
but, uh, you know,
you certainly got the posture.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.123
- Posture?
- They're beautiful, darling.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.026
You know what else is beautiful?
Fruit.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.328
You see a lot of paintings
of fruit.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.930
- Lighthouses?
- Doug!

09:22.996 --> 09:24.665
A pony.
You can paint a pony.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.299
You don't have to be staring
at a pony's ass.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.803
All right. Oh, okay,
who's this fella now?

09:29.870 --> 09:32.172
Um, that's my friend Sami.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.844
Sami. How do you get them
to pose for you like that?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.278
I pay 40 francs an hour.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.113
40 francs an hour?

09:40.180 --> 09:42.750
They don't give you, like,
a friend discount, huh?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.852
It's nice that she's
generous with her friends.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.186
With my money.
So technically,

09:46.253 --> 09:48.288
I'm being generous
to her friends.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.859
Darling, I'm so tired.
Can we please check
into the hotel?

09:51.925 --> 09:52.826
- I'm exhausted.
- Great idea.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.162
Yeah, you should rest up.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.296
We just got here.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.898
We have plenty of time
to catch up later.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.532
- That's right, darling.
- Yeah.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.835
Will you get us a dinner
reservation somewhere?
Somewhere nice?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.136
- Yeah, sure.
- All right.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.172
Just unpack and rest.
Rest up.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.741
- It'll be good. Come on.
- Doug!

10:07.808 --> 10:09.342
Yeah, okay. All right.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.011
Let's go. All right.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.882
So what we say, like,
dinner tonight,
like 7-7:30?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.183
- Something like that?
- Yeah, perfect.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.752
- See you tonight.
- Okay, bye.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.157
Holy shit.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.392
What are we gonna do?

10:32.299 --> 10:35.836
So what is this big surprise
you keep promising?

10:35.903 --> 10:37.137
Just another minute.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.907
Why don't you have
some more wine?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.942
- Mom?
- Hmm.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.913
- It's a boy.
- Don't be so sure.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.782
I'm telling you,
I know her, so you
better prepare yourself.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.684
Surprise.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.186
Hi, Mr. Getty, Mrs. Getty.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.331
- You look nice.
- Thanks. You, too.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.236
Et vous, Monsieur.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.873
And I'll have
the "loop de mere."

11:16.744 --> 11:18.411
- Merci.
- Merci, mademoiselle.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.580
I'm just going to run
to the toilette.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.450
I'm coming with you.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.797
It's the lying

11:36.864 --> 11:39.266
that I'm most pissed off about.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.369
- I'm sorry?
- All that horseshit
last summer.

11:42.435 --> 11:46.039
You want the bonus money
so you can get yourself
an apartment in the city.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.875
It wasn't a lie.
It wasn't a lie.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.943
Oh, really?
Did you get a place?

11:50.010 --> 11:52.980
Well, no. I was going to,
but I dropped out of NYU,

11:53.046 --> 11:54.514
so it didn't make much sense.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.683
So then you took my money
and bought a plane ticket

11:56.784 --> 11:59.152
to come here to schtup
my daughter.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.356
Your poor father,
he was so looking forward

12:03.423 --> 12:05.692
to spending
some quality time with you.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.494
That's not my fault.

12:11.965 --> 12:15.402
I don't think you know how much
stress he is under.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.371
You do realize
he can go to prison.

12:18.438 --> 12:23.176
He might even be banned from
working on Wall Street for life.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.179
You think about that.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.086
Tout fromage?

12:33.153 --> 12:36.089
What? No. Just the check.

12:45.866 --> 12:50.037
- Who the hell eats
cheese after a meal?
- The French.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.738
Well, that's why they're not
a superpower anymore.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.374
'cause their priorities
are all messed up.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.376
Okay, let's get you home
to bed, baby.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.847
Yes. We will all feel better
after a good night's sleep.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.515
And tomorrow, remember, we have
a very long day of sightseeing.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.117
Hmm?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.887
- Monsieur.
- Mmm.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.858
- Can I?
- David, don't be silly.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.693
- Please.
- Sure.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.595
'Cause it's a big one.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.932
Uh... of course. I mean,
I wouldn't have offered--

13:18.999 --> 13:20.000
Daddy, no.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.935
- Darling, please.
- No.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.605
I think that's very generous
of you, David.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.107
Thank you.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.344
There you go.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.994
- Thank you.
- Sure.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.395
I'll pay you back.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.897
No, it's okay.
Really, it's fine.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.665
Here we go.
There you go.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.202
Well, see you in the morning.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.703
You know, I just wanna say
a little change of plan.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.671
And for the record,
this is not my idea.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.974
We're gonna check out
of the Bristol,

14:01.041 --> 14:02.542
and we're gonna stay
with you.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.313
Surprise.

14:09.816 --> 14:13.420
- David, wait. Don't go.
- It's okay.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.089
No, I'll make them get
a hotel room.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.925
No, they're your family.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.759
Then we'll all stay at my place.
It's big enough.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.661
- And we're all adults.
- Definitely not.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.263
It isn't fair.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.598
I don't want them
to ruin our time together.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.334
They won't. I promise.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.602
I just think its best
for everyone if I find
someplace else to stay.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.274
- I guess you're right.
- Don't worry.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.476
I'll check into some
youth hostel or something.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.510
What? No.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.949
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

14:41.949 --> 14:44.484
My friends' Claire
and Etienne's place

14:44.551 --> 14:46.119
from the other night?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.988
I'm sure they won't mind
if you sleep on their sofa

14:48.055 --> 14:50.090
- for a couple of nights.
- Interesting.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.096
Thanks again.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.198
Sweet dreams.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.137
Bonjour.

15:37.204 --> 15:40.340
- Hi.
- You sleep okay?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.309
- Oh, yes.
- Good.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.549
You want to join us?

15:51.018 --> 15:53.720
- Excuse me?
- With us.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.158
For food.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.827
Oh. Oh, sure.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.229
Oh, yeah. Great.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.664
Yeah, that's great.
Thank you. Yeah.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.299
**

16:10.303 --> 16:12.439
**

16:16.043 --> 16:17.644
Oh, my God!

16:17.710 --> 16:19.479
**

16:37.964 --> 16:40.567
**

17:01.488 --> 17:03.223
Really?

17:03.290 --> 17:06.159
**

17:13.600 --> 17:16.669
- Oh.
- Don't tell me
you're still jetlagged.

17:16.736 --> 17:21.174
Just not sleeping.
That facacta bed she's got
is killing my back.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.676
Can we please move back
to the Bristol?

17:23.743 --> 17:26.113
No, we can't.
I flew 3,000 miles

17:26.146 --> 17:28.215
to spend time together
as a family.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.616
And that's what we're gonna do.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.452
Bad enough I gotta share
with this little fucker.

17:41.694 --> 17:45.898
- I don't get it.
- It's a man with
a dead tiger on his head.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.000
- What's to get?
- No, him.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.237
I don't get
what she sees in him.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.939
Skinny little merink
college dropout.

17:53.005 --> 17:56.143
He'll end up being
a shoe salesman or something.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.744
You know what I don't get?

17:57.810 --> 17:59.479
Why you're letting this boy
get under your skin

17:59.546 --> 18:01.414
more than the others
she's brought home.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.650
That's another thing.
She never brought him home.

18:03.716 --> 18:07.487
Why? We used to have
such a good relationship.

18:07.554 --> 18:12.692
- Not all this sneaking around.
- Darling. Please.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.628
Try not to ruin
our time here together.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.898
Who knows when we'll
be back here, hmm?

18:18.965 --> 18:20.400
- You're right.
- Hmm.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.668
- You're right.
- Now.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.205
- If you are a good boy--
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.174
...I will let you buy me
something expensive.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.642
You know that
always cheers you up.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.743
It kind of does.

18:35.382 --> 18:38.185
**

18:41.554 --> 18:43.423
What the hell kind of place
is this, anyway?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.558
Isn't it fun?
You would never find a place

18:45.625 --> 18:47.294
- like this in New York.
- Thank God.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.929
This is what you get
when you elect a socialist.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.199
Does anyone know the time?

18:52.199 --> 18:55.602
Oh, wait a second, I do.
It's almost midnight.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.604
- It's really gorgeous, Mom.
- I know!

18:57.670 --> 19:00.240
Could you die? I'm going
to be buried in this thing.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.641
It looks very nice
on you, baby.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.210
You know what looks nice
on you?

19:03.210 --> 19:04.611
- Hmm?
- Lipstick.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.548
I can't believe
it's almost 1986.

19:08.615 --> 19:13.220
I can't believe your father
and I have been married
25 years this summer.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.388
- Really? Wow!
- Wow. What's your secret?

19:15.455 --> 19:17.524
Not asking stupid
fucking questions.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.092
- Daddy.
- I need another drink.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.994
Let me get that for you.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.830
Will you get me one, too?

19:25.031 --> 19:27.500
Sure.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.403
- I hope your using protection.
- Mother.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.507
Excuse me. Hey, chief. Yo.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.944
Buddy. What's with this guy?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.946
He must hate Americans.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.382
Guess they forget
if it weren't for us,
this would be a beer garden.

19:42.449 --> 19:46.719
Think you'd take a shot
at Feinberg for the club
championship next summer?

19:46.786 --> 19:48.721
I don't know.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.257
If you wanted to, we
could train this winter.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.958
I'm teaching
at a club downtown.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.595
- Don't.
- No, Nash says he has a friend
at one in Midtown, so...

19:55.662 --> 19:58.097
Not that, this. What you're
doing, don't do this.

19:58.164 --> 20:02.735
- What am I doing?
- Trying to bond.
I don't need it.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.505
Oh, I thought I was just
making conversation.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.242
Look, I'm gonna be straight
with you.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.777
You're a nice enough kid.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.612
You're just not good enough
for my daughter.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.447
And I don't say that
to offend you.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.716
This is not about me being
an overprotective father.

20:16.783 --> 20:20.753
This is just me being
a good judge of character.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.523
In my line of work,
you get very good
at picking winners.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.892
And when I look at you,

20:25.958 --> 20:28.461
that's not what I see.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.865
There you are.
What's taking you so long?

20:32.932 --> 20:35.201
Come on. We gotta go.
It's time.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.069
David, hey.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.171
Come on. What's wrong?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.908
Uh, nothing. No, I--

21:11.404 --> 21:13.005
Did you say something
to David?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.342
Hmm? What?

21:15.342 --> 21:20.347
Ever since New Year's Eve,
he's been acting kind of
subdued.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.883
No. We had a little talk.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.251
About what?

21:25.352 --> 21:27.253
You know, his future

21:27.354 --> 21:30.823
and his intentions
with my little daughter.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.693
Okay. we're ready.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.663
Darling, good-bye, good-bye,
good-bye. I love you.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.031
You take care of yourself.
Don't get too skinny.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.434
And call us, all right?
Darling, we gotta go.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.203
- You bet.
- Bye.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.672
David.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.642
- Need some money?
- Muchas gracias.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.645
Take some.
You'll have it.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.748
You gotta a nice little life
here, sweetheart.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.250
I know the plan is
for you to come back in May,

21:58.385 --> 22:00.987
but I was thinking...

22:01.053 --> 22:04.424
Why don't you extend
your stay a little bit?

22:04.491 --> 22:06.893
- And what about school?
- You transfer.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.962
They have a nice thing
at the Sorbonne.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.265
I mean, Mom and I
would miss you, obviously,

22:13.400 --> 22:15.835
but we'll come visit.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.571
It's not like we don't know
our way around now.

22:18.638 --> 22:23.042
Think about it.
It's an idea.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.578
- Sweetheart, we gotta go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.079
- We're gonna miss the plane.
- Okay.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.948
- Darling.
- Jesus Christ.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.651
Have a good flight,
Mr. Getty.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.627
Don't worry, darling.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.929
Her little fling
will be over by summer.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.196
Mark my words.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.865
Okay.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.475
It's the longest week
of my life.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.812
You okay?

22:59.879 --> 23:01.514
Huh?

23:01.581 --> 23:02.749
Fine.

23:11.791 --> 23:12.892
Oh!

23:18.631 --> 23:20.700
**

23:46.258 --> 23:48.895
- I don't want you to go.
- Me neither.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.667
- Then don't.
- What do you mean?

23:56.402 --> 23:59.238
It's not like there's anything
waiting for you back home

23:59.305 --> 24:00.406
in New Jersey.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.341
I mean, you hate school.

24:02.408 --> 24:05.011
You said yourself
that it's a waste of time,

24:05.077 --> 24:07.880
and you wanna drop out.

24:07.947 --> 24:08.981
So do it.

24:09.048 --> 24:12.084
- What would I do here?
- Learn French.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.522
Travel. Make short films.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.023
Well, for starters,
I couldn't afford it.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.725
I mean, this trip has
wiped out most of my savings.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.927
- What would I do for money?
- I'll support us.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.530
- No. No way.
- Give me one reason.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.297
'Cause you wouldn't be
supporting us.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.933
Your father would.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.968
And I'm pretty sure
there's a rule about how long

24:29.035 --> 24:30.603
a person could stay
in a foreign country.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.940
God. Don't be so rational.

24:34.006 --> 24:37.109
Well, I don't know
how not to be.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.613
I'd like to.
I really would.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.348
I'm just...

24:42.414 --> 24:46.018
It's not that easy for me.

24:47.353 --> 24:48.788
It's gonna be okay.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.157
The summer will be here
before you know it.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.560
You'll come home,
and we'll be together.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.564
Unless I don't.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.932
Don't what?

24:59.999 --> 25:02.034
Come home?

25:05.071 --> 25:09.008
My father offered to let me stay
and transfer to the Sorbonne.

25:13.412 --> 25:14.747
Wow.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.151
Is that what you want?

25:19.218 --> 25:20.186
I don't know.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.992
I mean, I love it here.

26:00.359 --> 26:03.495
* This is why
events unnerve me *

26:03.630 --> 26:07.066
* They find it all,
a different story *

26:07.133 --> 26:10.402
* Notice whom
for wheels are turning *

26:10.469 --> 26:14.406
* Turn again
and turn towards this time *

26:14.473 --> 26:18.344
* All she asks is strength
to hold me *

26:18.410 --> 26:21.748
* Then again,
the same old story *

26:21.814 --> 26:25.051
* Word will travel
oh, so quickly *

26:25.117 --> 26:28.755
* Travel first
and lead towards this time *

26:34.794 --> 26:36.929
* I'll break them all *

26:36.996 --> 26:39.331
* No mercy shown *

26:39.398 --> 26:42.902
* Heaven knows,
it's got to be this time *

26:42.969 --> 26:44.170
* Watching her *

26:44.236 --> 26:46.038
* These things she said *

26:46.105 --> 26:47.674
* The times she cried *

26:47.740 --> 26:50.710
* Too frail to wake
this time *
