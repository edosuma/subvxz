WEBVTT

03:37.000 --> 03:38.500
When?

03:40.100 --> 03:41.300
Today.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.800
Yeah, when today?

03:44.300 --> 03:46.900
Please. I'll tell him.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.100
Hey, kids, how we doing?

03:55.700 --> 03:57.600
We're good. Good.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.800
And I wasn't trying to surprise you.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.900
We weren't really surprised, sir.

04:06.900 --> 04:12.300
Christian, do you think it's possible
for you to stop calling me "sir"?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
I really feel old when you do that.

04:16.899 --> 04:20.200
You know, I thought we had
an agreement here.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.100
Dad, we're just sitting. People sit.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.700
Look, honey, I'm not trying
to give you guys a hard time...

04:26.900 --> 04:28.700
...but we have discussed this,
you know?

04:28.900 --> 04:31.400
Technically, you're under my roof still...

04:31.600 --> 04:34.500
...and I don't feel comfortable
with the two of you in here--

04:34.700 --> 04:38.000
Stop. Have you seen
the size of this boat?

04:38.200 --> 04:40.400
Don't you think we could find
a zillion places...

04:40.600 --> 04:42.900
...to do that thing you think we wanna do
if we wanted?

04:43.100 --> 04:44.500
Jennifer, I'm simply saying--

04:44.700 --> 04:50.000
No. I'm over your patronizing tone,
okay? I'm really over it.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.000
Hey, is she like this with you?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
-I'm sorry.
-No, excuse me.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.900
I'm trying to find the galley.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I think it's off-limits to guests.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.900
Not so much of a rules person.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.500
-It's quite a lobby, isn't it?
-Yeah.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.800
This the first time
you've been through here?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
So I guess you missed the tour,
then, huh?

05:52.200 --> 05:56.900
But you had to come through here
when we boarded. Didn't you?

05:59.200 --> 06:04.000
Through that door is a service corridor.
Take a left, all the way to the end.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.300
Hi, it's me.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.900
Could you call me? Please?

06:21.600 --> 06:25.000
I'm actually begging, aren't I?

06:26.200 --> 06:30.400
I'd like you to call me at midnight.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.400
You know, for old times' sake.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.700
Bye.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.700
Baby, baby, baby....

06:45.300 --> 06:48.900
Hey. You were supposed to
stay inside. That was the deal.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.300
The TV isn't working. I'm cramped.
I'm going crazy in there.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
Come here, come here, come here.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.500
Coming through.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.900
It's just, Elena...

07:00.100 --> 07:04.100
-...I could lose my job for this, you know?
-It's not that I'm not grateful, Valentin.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.600
I'm just.... I'm so bored.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.200
-You hungry? You must be hungry.
-I'm starving.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.200
Now, Elena, listen.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.400
Look at me. Promise me
you will not come out again.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.700
The ocean has always been
the cradle of rebirth.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.400
Since man first emerged
from these salty depths...

07:39.600 --> 07:43.800
...we have looked to water as a chance
to begin anew.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.700
Poseidon was the god of the sea.

07:46.900 --> 07:51.600
He made his home on the ocean floor
in a palace of coral and gems.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.800
And so, what better way to celebrate
the birth of a new year...

07:55.000 --> 07:57.400
...than borne on the back
of the old fellow himself?

07:57.600 --> 08:00.300
May you all have clear sailing
in the new year...

08:00.400 --> 08:02.400
...and all the years to come.

08:04.600 --> 08:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
the incomparable Gloria!

08:44.600 --> 08:47.700
-Five thousand.
-Five thousand to call.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.600
Goddamn, boy.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.100
You got some mighty big ones on you.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.000
-Hey, honey.
-Yes, sir.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.000
Get Lucky Larry another drink,
would you? Martini. Okay, babe?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.700
-There's blood in the water tonight.
-Five thousand to call, sir.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.800
You know, I think there's more money in
that pot than my old man made in a year.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.100
Five, and 10.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.300
Fifteen to call.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.900
Happiest time of my life
is when I was broke.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.200
Make it 20.

09:20.300 --> 09:23.900
Let's make it 20, and let's make it 40.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.500
You miss being mayor?

09:29.700 --> 09:30.900
Do you ever win?

09:33.200 --> 09:34.500
Forty more to you, sir.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.800
Goddamn, this is getting good.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.600
-Dad. We're going downstairs.
-Hello, sweetie. Have fun.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.200
-Hey, Jen.
-What?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.300
Come on.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.200
I can see, you know.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.800
The twins? Dad.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.500
Can you just...?
One more button, please?

09:56.400 --> 09:57.700
Pair of fives, huh, Dad?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.000
Oh, God.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.100
All in.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.300
I'll fold.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.900
-Oh, hey, kid, you all right?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

10:40.300 --> 10:44.200
-How much for the game?
-I don't know, what's it worth to you?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.800
You were minding your own business
and those chips...

10:47.000 --> 10:50.200
-...jumped out in front of you.
-I wasn't watching where I was going.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.800
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.100
-Sorry about that.
-Not a problem.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.700
Guess what. Your friend the captain
wants you to blow the New Year's horn.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.500
No way! Mom?

11:00.600 --> 11:02.800
Go. Conor?

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
Thanks, sorry, bye!

11:05.700 --> 11:09.100
-Great kid.
-Yeah, he is. Still amazes me, actually.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.700
So the captain's table? That's a nice place
to spend New Year's Eve.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.500
Does your husband--?

11:14.700 --> 11:16.100
-That work much?
-What?

11:16.700 --> 11:20.100
The tentative mention of a husband
I'm supposed to correct...

11:20.300 --> 11:23.400
...even though you clocked
my wedding finger twice already?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.800
It usually works better than that, yeah.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.100
Normally what you get
on these cruise ships...

11:29.300 --> 11:33.800
...is your desperate single woman hoping to
meet a guy, and you sure don't fit the bill.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.100
That's not actually supposed to generate
a thank-you, was it?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.100
Maggie James.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.700
Dylan.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.800
-What do you do, Mr. Dylan?
-First name.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.100
Well, somebody's gonna
drink too much...

11:51.300 --> 11:53.800
...and get into a fight
with their wife or husband...

11:53.900 --> 11:56.500
...and come up here and start buying
chips in a frenzy.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.800
Any night, but particularly tonight.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.700
And I take their money.
That's what I do.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.600
Professionally.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.400
That supposed to be sexy?

12:06.300 --> 12:08.000
Depends. Was it?

12:09.500 --> 12:12.400
Nice to meet you, first name Dylan.

12:45.900 --> 12:48.500
Come on. That's right.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.400
Decided, sir?

12:56.500 --> 13:01.600
We will have the RomanÃ©e-Conti,
1988, please.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.500
Very well, sir.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.300
-Nelson....
-My treat.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.500
That's a five-thousand-dollar
bottle of wine.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.300
Carpe diem, my friend.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.200
Carpe diem.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.700
There was no work crisis.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.200
What do you mean?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.800
I'm sorry, I lied.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.600
Apparently...

13:26.800 --> 13:32.000
...the one who really missed
the boat in London was me.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.200
He's met someone.

13:36.100 --> 13:39.100
He didn't mean to hurt me.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.700
He never thought that this
would happen to him.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.500
I'm sure that you know this whole song,
so I don't have to sing it for you.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.300
I think I'll get some air.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.300
And then we'll have some wine.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.200
Lots and lots of wine.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.200
Quiet. Quiet.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.500
Gentlemen, keep it down.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.700
Do you feel that?

14:14.200 --> 14:15.800
Something's off.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.200
Here we go!

14:17.400 --> 14:21.400
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

14:21.500 --> 14:26.500
Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

14:26.600 --> 14:28.500
Happy New Year!

14:28.600 --> 14:30.700
Happy New Year!

14:37.500 --> 14:38.500
Happy New Year.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.600
Happy New Year!

15:11.800 --> 15:13.300
<i>You have no messages.</i>

15:30.900 --> 15:32.600
No.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.300
No.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.700
Hard to starboard!
Starboard engines, full astern!

15:39.900 --> 15:43.600
-Starboard engines, full astern!
-I got it, I got it! Come on.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.300
Turn. Turn!

16:08.000 --> 16:09.300
Turn!

16:09.400 --> 16:11.800
Come on. Come on, come on!

16:23.000 --> 16:24.800
-Bow thrusters!
-Full to starboard!

16:24.900 --> 16:26.500
Sounding general alarm.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.200
<i>All crew, report immediately</i>
<i>to your emergency stations.</i>

16:33.300 --> 16:38.800
<i>This is not a drill. All passengers,</i>
<i>brace for immediate and heavy rolls.</i>

16:43.300 --> 16:45.700
Stay there. I'm coming, baby!

16:46.300 --> 16:48.300
Just stay there! Wait for me!

16:49.100 --> 16:53.500
<i>Fire, life and safety crews, proceed to</i>
<i>your muster stations immediately.</i>

16:53.700 --> 16:55.300
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

20:19.300 --> 20:20.600
Help me!

20:27.300 --> 20:29.000
Stay calm!

20:31.400 --> 20:33.300
Conor?

20:37.800 --> 20:40.800
Oh, my God.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.700
Conor!

21:03.500 --> 21:04.900
Chris.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.700
Christian.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.900
Christian!

21:15.800 --> 21:17.300
Are you okay?

21:21.300 --> 21:22.500
Hey.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.000
My leg's pinned.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.600
Come on.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.400
Help. Somebody. Please, please.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.100
Please, help me.
I can't lift this by myself.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.200
-Please help me. Please.
-Okay.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.900
On three.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.700
One, two, three.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.500
Again. One, two, three.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.400
Conor!

21:50.600 --> 21:52.800
Everyone, remain calm. Remain calm.

21:53.300 --> 21:56.600
Hey, lady. Up there.

21:58.500 --> 22:01.200
Hey! We need some help over here.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.700
Scootch back from the edge! Be careful!

22:04.400 --> 22:05.900
-Grab the side of that.
-Okay.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.700
-Conor!
-Come here. Grab the other side of that.

22:09.900 --> 22:10.900
You're okay!

22:11.100 --> 22:13.200
-His name Conor?
-Yeah.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.000
All right, Conor, I want you to jump
into this curtain.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.600
What are you doing?

22:18.800 --> 22:21.900
I used to be a fireman. We're gonna
get him down safe and sound.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.800
You'll be all right, Conor. Come on, kid.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.800
Jump! Right now!

22:32.100 --> 22:33.600
Sweetie.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.500
Everything's okay.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.400
Move this thing.

23:18.900 --> 23:21.400
We need something to leverage this.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.200
No.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.900
I'll go.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.800
It's just dead people, right?

23:33.200 --> 23:34.700
-Baby, stay here.
-I'm here.

23:34.900 --> 23:36.700
-Stay with me.
-We're gonna be okay.

23:36.900 --> 23:41.100
Now, we're not sure exactly what
happened here, but our best guess...

23:41.200 --> 23:45.800
...is that we were struck by what is
known as a rogue wave.

23:45.900 --> 23:49.400
They're rare. They're unpredictable.
And they are lethal.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.600
Now the good news.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.500
The instant this ship was struck...

23:54.700 --> 23:58.200
...emergency GPS locator beacons
were launched...

23:58.400 --> 24:02.300
...so we are, at most,
several hours from rescue.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.300
-Are we sinking?
-How do we get out?

24:07.200 --> 24:09.700
Please. Do yourself a favor.

24:09.900 --> 24:13.200
Follow the directions of my officers
and stay calm.

24:13.300 --> 24:17.300
This room is a giant air bubble
holding up the ship.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.100
Once these bulkhead doors
are sealed...

24:20.300 --> 24:23.800
...we'll be safe from gas leaks,
fire and flooding.

24:24.700 --> 24:27.500
We will be safe.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.000
What are you doing?

24:52.700 --> 24:54.400
I'm getting out of here.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.900
Where are you going?

24:57.600 --> 25:00.900
I'm going up.
And out through the bottom.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.700
Wait. How are you gonna get out
of the bottom of the boat?

25:03.900 --> 25:06.400
That's the part that's all sealed up.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.700
She was in the nightclub.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.700
We have people there.
I'm confident they're dealing with it.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.800
You're confident? You can't reach them,
can you? I mean, what if they're dead?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.200
Then your daughter's dead too,
and leaving this room won't help.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.800
Half the people here have families
somewhere onboard.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.300
You know disaster scenarios.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.800
These folks start climbing over each other
trying to search the ship...

25:25.900 --> 25:28.800
-...they're gonna get killed.
-How do I get up there, captain?

25:28.900 --> 25:31.100
-I'm sorry, but you need to stay here.
-How--?

25:31.300 --> 25:34.700
-You may not leave this ballroom.
-Excuse me?

25:35.500 --> 25:37.700
I'm within my authority
to compel you to stay.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.900
Captain, I understand
you have no choice.

25:40.100 --> 25:43.100
There's sick and injured people here.
You need to stay with them.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.000
But I am going to find my daughter...

25:45.100 --> 25:48.600
...and don't for one second
think you can stop me.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.900
Dylan. What did you say to him?

25:55.100 --> 25:58.300
Mom, there's holes at the bottom
of the ship with propellers in them.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.200
You can't get out that way, sweetie.
Please tell him you can't.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.200
Will you please take me and my mom?

26:04.700 --> 26:05.900
Oh, Jesus.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.400
Tell him you can't. Please.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.900
But I can.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.600
You think you can get us
off this boat safely?

26:12.800 --> 26:14.600
What? Us? No.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.700
Hey. We're going out
through the bow thrusters.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.800
Captain's saying we should stay here.

26:19.900 --> 26:24.600
I wouldn't put a lot of faith in what
the captain has to say. I'm an architect.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.400
These ships weren't designed to stay
afloat upside down.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.600
You know this ship?

26:29.800 --> 26:31.800
-I know ships.
-Know where the disco is?

26:31.900 --> 26:33.700
It's one story down, which is now up.

26:33.900 --> 26:36.700
-Suddenly in the mood to go dancing?
-My daughter's in there.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.700
Dylan, listen to me. Hey, Dylan, wait.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.200
Let's stick together here.
We'll get my daughter...

26:41.300 --> 26:45.100
-...then we help each other find a way out.
-Look, man, I work better on my own.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.000
-No offense.
-None taken.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.600
So where's the nearest vertical access?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.200
I'll know when I find it.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.400
-Hey, hey. You work here, right?
-Yeah.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.100
Where's the nearest vertical access?

26:58.300 --> 26:59.900
Service stairs, like, in the galley.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.300
Whatever you earn in a year, I'll double it
if you take us there now.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.900
Done.

27:06.100 --> 27:08.700
You got a plan, and now we got a map.

27:09.700 --> 27:12.300
-lf you're coming, keep up.
-Let's go.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.700
Hey, Mom, are we going with them?

27:16.800 --> 27:18.500
Yeah, baby, let's go.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.900
Ramsey!

27:41.100 --> 27:44.000
You know we have to seal
the bulkhead doors.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.700
-Seal the doors.
-Yes, sir.

27:58.100 --> 28:00.000
Don't touch anything, sweetie.

28:11.500 --> 28:15.000
I know it's been a while, God,
and I've been out of touch...

28:15.700 --> 28:19.200
...but please, please, please
be with me.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.900
Be with me. Be with me.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.800
What the hell did you go and do
to all these people?

28:45.700 --> 28:46.900
Cover your face, honey.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.700
-Those are the service stairs, right?
-Yeah, behind this.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.500
Damn it.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.600
People, we got a problem.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.400
Hey. Hey, map. What's through here?

28:58.600 --> 29:01.400
Yeah. That's the--
That's the service elevator.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.500
We're gonna get through this.
Let's go.

29:05.900 --> 29:08.600
Find something we can pry it with.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.300
All right. What's through there?
Is there a way up?

29:34.500 --> 29:38.500
-More stairs.
-More stairs. Okay, let's find something.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.700
Careful. Careful. All right.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.900
-Okay, get the front up.
-I got it.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.200
Ready? One, two, three.

29:56.100 --> 29:57.800
-Shit. Pick it up.
-Hold it!

30:05.900 --> 30:07.500
-Don't let it rock.
-Easy.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.100
I can't get leverage.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.800
Hey, what if we go through up there?

30:19.900 --> 30:21.700
The entertainment section's up there.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.200
-Come give me a hand.
-We'll hold it steady. You'll be all right.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.700
It's okay. Come on.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
-Go.
-Come on.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.600
Okay. Now put your back up
against this wall. Come on.

30:40.700 --> 30:43.400
-Good.
-Hurry, hurry!

30:43.600 --> 30:45.500
-Now give me a stirrup.
-Okay, okay.

30:50.300 --> 30:52.200
Go up.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.700
It's okay! Honey.

31:05.600 --> 31:08.000
Okay. Send the kid. Come on.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.700
Don't look down.

31:12.100 --> 31:15.200
-Come on. All right.
-That's it. Don't look down, honey.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.300
-It's okay.
-It's okay, son.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.200
-That's it, that's it. Look, look.
-That's good.

31:23.300 --> 31:24.900
That's it!

31:25.100 --> 31:26.700
Excellent. Put your hands up.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.600
Reach your hands up to me.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.400
Up!

31:32.000 --> 31:33.200
Gotcha.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.700
-Good boy!
-Okay. Come on, Maggie.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.000
Come on. Keep coming.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.100
Good.

31:42.700 --> 31:46.000
Okay, up. One, two, three.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.300
Okay. I got this.

32:03.800 --> 32:04.900
Damn it.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.800
Hold on, hold on!

32:11.100 --> 32:13.500
-Thank you, gorgeous.
-My name's Valentin.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.500
Valentin. I love that name.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.000
You-- You go first.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.300
-Come on.
-You go first!

32:27.200 --> 32:30.600
-Come on, give me your hand.
-Give me your foot. Give me your foot.

32:32.300 --> 32:33.900
I gotcha.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.100
Hang on!

32:47.400 --> 32:48.900
He's gonna take them both down.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.700
-Stay back, sweetie.
-I'm gonna anchor us. Hold onto him!

32:51.900 --> 32:53.200
Help me up!

32:54.200 --> 32:57.100
-It's okay.
-Come on!

33:01.700 --> 33:02.800
Help me up!

33:03.000 --> 33:04.900
Give me one of my hands.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.700
I'm losing him.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.900
Shake him off.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.400
Shake him off!

33:21.500 --> 33:24.200
-Now, or you both die!
-No!

33:24.300 --> 33:26.100
I'm so sorry.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.700
Shake him off! Now!

33:30.800 --> 33:34.100
No! No! No!

33:46.200 --> 33:47.700
Come on!

33:53.800 --> 33:56.100
-Captain.
-That felt like the galley.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.000
Gas shutoffs must have malfunctioned.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.200
The door seals,
will they keep the fire out?

34:00.400 --> 34:03.700
-Yes, captain.
-Help! Somebody, over here.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.900
God rest their souls.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.800
I'll take a look.

34:56.199 --> 34:58.500
Come on, I think I found a way.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.700
Come on.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.600
Maybe you could move your leg.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.200
-l-- Nothing.
-Try pulling it up.

35:19.400 --> 35:24.000
Two girls squawking at you,
and nowhere to run. You are in hell, boy.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.900
Any of you skirts ever changed
a goddamn tire?

35:27.100 --> 35:28.300
Enlighten us, cowboy.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.000
Feisty.

35:31.200 --> 35:35.700
Never really works to pull when all you
really needed was some good pushing.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.900
-Know what I mean?
-Hurry up and lift the thing!

35:40.100 --> 35:41.700
All right, grab hold.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.800
Three, two, one. Push!

35:47.300 --> 35:48.900
Come on!

35:49.000 --> 35:53.200
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
We got ourselves a situation.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.400
-We can do this.
-Come on!

35:56.800 --> 36:00.300
Three, two, one, push!

36:08.000 --> 36:09.400
Happy New Year.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.200
Happy goddamn New Year.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.500
What?

36:26.100 --> 36:27.300
Daddy?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.500
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.700
All right, all right.
There you go.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.200
Give me your water and your hankie,
sweetie.

36:54.800 --> 36:58.400
I think it's just a cut, but I wanna
clean it anyway, okay?

36:58.600 --> 37:00.800
I'm gonna look for a way out of here.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.400
-Chris.
-Yeah?

37:06.300 --> 37:09.300
Thank you very much.

37:11.300 --> 37:14.800
Sir, I didn't.... I mean, she saved me.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.300
Are you okay?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.900
Just a bad headache.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.800
Here, finish this.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.800
One thing we have a lot of around here
is water.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.700
My name is Nelson.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.800
Elena. How bad is it?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.800
It's very bad.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.100
Were you with someone?

37:46.300 --> 37:48.100
Yeah.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.300
Not really.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.400
My brother's in the hospital.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.200
I didn't have any money
to get to New York...

38:00.300 --> 38:04.400
...so I meet this guy at a club,
he works on a ship.

38:04.600 --> 38:09.000
He says I can bunk with him,
you know, for passage.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.100
He was pretty nice.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.000
What are you doing?

38:23.500 --> 38:24.900
Thinking.

38:25.700 --> 38:28.900
-You?
-Thinking.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.800
What are we thinking about, exactly?

38:32.200 --> 38:34.900
Well, I figure this door is the way up.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.900
I'm thinking, "What's behind it?"

38:39.500 --> 38:41.900
Hey. Easy there, fireball.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.600
Watch.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.500
Conor! Hey, Conor, what are you doing?

38:51.700 --> 38:53.800
Hey, Mom, this door is the way up.

38:53.900 --> 38:56.700
Don't walk off from me like that, okay?

38:57.200 --> 38:59.800
-Hey, it's the other guy.
-Hey.

39:00.100 --> 39:03.700
Yeah, Robert, that door is extremely
hot, but it's our only choice.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.800
-Here. What do you think?
-Let's give it a shot.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
I'm hoping it was a flash fire, but this
whole area could be superheated still, right?

39:11.200 --> 39:14.100
-You tour on a sub?
-I wouldn't call it touring.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.000
Go.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.900
-Flash fire.
-Good call.

39:23.100 --> 39:24.600
It's all right.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.400
-So how long were you in the Navy?
-Too long.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.300
I feel like I know your dad.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.600
He was mayor of New York for a while.
When I was a kid.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.500
Cool.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.900
It wasn't.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.700
Another way up, anybody?

40:02.900 --> 40:05.900
I've been sneaking around
this ship for days. This is it.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.400
-All right, then we climb.
-Is it gonna hold?

40:08.600 --> 40:10.200
It's possible. It is steel.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.400
Look at the monkey boy.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.500
Chris, what are you doing? Come back.

40:19.900 --> 40:22.000
I think it'll hold.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.400
Go easy.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Elena.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.000
You're halfway there, come on.

40:43.500 --> 40:46.100
Chris, wait. Come back and get Conor.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.200
Conor, put your foot right where my foot is
and go to Robert.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.600
There you go. Put your hand right there.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.800
Okay, hang on. I'll grab him.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.900
Great.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.400
You might wanna take it easy on that.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.100
-You got him, Chris?
-I got him.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.100
Excellent, excellent, excellent, yes.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.900
-You got her?
-Okay. Here you go.

41:19.300 --> 41:23.100
-Okay, baby, it's your turn.
-Hell, no. Lucky Larry's ready to go.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.800
What?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.800
Oh, yeah. Right, sorry.

41:27.900 --> 41:31.000
You know, I forgot. Big hero.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.900
Rescued all those women and children
from the fires.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.100
Got elected. Man of the people.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.800
But you're not the boss anymore.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.800
You quit, couldn't hack it.

41:44.500 --> 41:47.800
If I recall correctly, you couldn't even
hang onto your wife.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.200
Come on. Come on.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.300
Dad. Dad, let it go, okay? Please.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.300
"Daddy, please." Come on.

42:01.400 --> 42:06.000
Hey, man. Hey, you got it.
Knock yourself out.

42:06.100 --> 42:08.000
-It's okay.
-Go ahead.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.100
Assholes, both of you.

42:10.300 --> 42:12.400
You're right. It's okay.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.600
I'm not gonna let you bring me down
with you, not by a short hair.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.500
You don't just get the nickname
Lucky Larry.

42:22.700 --> 42:25.000
You gotta be lucky.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.200
No!

42:35.300 --> 42:36.800
Damn it.

42:38.900 --> 42:40.500
Hey, who's shooting at us?

42:54.800 --> 42:56.700
Jen! Jen!

43:00.700 --> 43:02.600
Get back, get back!

43:10.600 --> 43:14.600
So we gotta go back down one level
and we find another way up.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.800
Go back down? We just came
through there. There is no other way.

43:17.900 --> 43:19.100
You go that way, you die.

43:19.300 --> 43:21.200
We didn't look through every corridor.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.400
You do what you want.
I'm getting across.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.400
If you got a better idea,
I'm all ears--

43:25.600 --> 43:28.500
No, Robert, I don't got another way,
but I'm getting across!

43:28.600 --> 43:31.200
You get stuck here, you'll die!
We're going. Let's go.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.900
-Daddy, I can't. I'm sorry.
-What?

43:34.100 --> 43:37.400
-Dylan, can you get me across?
-Jen, baby girl, listen--

43:37.600 --> 43:41.100
No! I haven't been in
a long time, Dad.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.200
Chris asked me to marry him.

43:54.300 --> 43:58.300
I love him. I need to find a way
to go with him.

43:58.500 --> 44:01.800
-No, you need to listen to me for a second.
-I'm not going back, Dad.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.900
I hate to break up the family therapy,
but you still looking for a way across?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.400
Yes.

44:39.300 --> 44:41.900
Do you see him? Where is he?

44:43.900 --> 44:45.900
Hey, did you miss me?

44:47.900 --> 44:49.300
Son of a bitch.

44:55.400 --> 44:58.100
-What do you need?
-All right. Take the slack.

45:04.600 --> 45:05.800
Got it?

45:08.700 --> 45:10.800
Hey, Ramsey! Ramsey!

45:11.800 --> 45:13.300
Come on.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.400
I did the hard part.

45:20.600 --> 45:24.000
You couldn't even find your way home
from school. We lived two blocks away.

45:24.500 --> 45:28.000
-I remember, Dad.
-Hey, Ramsey, come on!

45:33.700 --> 45:35.100
Daddy?

45:37.600 --> 45:40.500
Come on, Jen, you'll be fine. Come on!

45:40.700 --> 45:42.400
Jenny!

45:44.600 --> 45:47.400
Now, what kind of kid
can't find her way home?

45:47.600 --> 45:49.100
I was 7, by the way.

45:49.300 --> 45:52.300
So, what do you think?
You too big for a piggyback ride?

45:52.400 --> 45:55.900
-Not today.
-All right.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.500
All right, baby. Hold on.

45:59.700 --> 46:02.200
Here we go. Hang on, baby!

46:05.600 --> 46:07.100
I gotcha.

46:07.300 --> 46:08.900
They're okay.

46:12.800 --> 46:15.300
-You wanna hit me?
-Actually...

46:15.500 --> 46:19.000
...you're doing pretty good. So far.

46:19.200 --> 46:20.600
Can we keep going here?

46:20.800 --> 46:23.300
Yeah, let's go.
This way's the best way up.

47:16.700 --> 47:18.200
Hurry.

47:52.900 --> 47:53.800
You're okay.

48:03.700 --> 48:05.400
Let's go.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.400
Come on!

48:24.600 --> 48:27.600
Come on, let's go.
Look for a way up, everybody.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.600
-I got an access hatch here!
-Over here!

48:39.600 --> 48:42.700
Dylan, we got water coming in
over here!

48:53.000 --> 48:54.800
Back up!

48:55.700 --> 49:00.200
-Get back!
-Wait a minute. I got something here!

49:02.200 --> 49:03.700
All right, get that corner.

49:06.700 --> 49:09.600
We can't all fit in there.
We don't even know where it goes.

49:09.800 --> 49:13.000
If we stay here, we drown. Let's go!
We gotta keep moving up.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.500
Oh, my God!

49:15.800 --> 49:19.100
All right. I got a vertical shaft
up ahead about 10 yards.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.300
Looks like it leads to the upper levels.

49:21.400 --> 49:23.400
-Chris?
-Might as well give him a chance...

49:23.600 --> 49:25.800
-...to kick me in the head.
-Come on, Chris!

49:43.000 --> 49:45.800
We're good. The shaft leads up.

49:46.500 --> 49:49.900
-Are you okay, sweetheart?
-I think so.

49:50.100 --> 49:51.500
Just keep on moving.

50:10.500 --> 50:13.500
God. How the hell
did you fit through here?

50:17.500 --> 50:20.800
Mom, don't look down, okay?

50:22.200 --> 50:24.100
-Okay, Nelson, you're next.
-Okay.

50:24.200 --> 50:27.000
-I'll be the last one. You go.
-Elena, just get in the vent.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.300
-I'll wait here a little longer.
-You're fine.

50:29.400 --> 50:32.500
-I can't go in there. I'm sorry, I can't!
-Elena, get in the vent.

50:32.700 --> 50:34.700
The water's rising.
Elena, get in the vent!

50:34.900 --> 50:38.900
-Elena, if you don't go, we don't go.
-What? What?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.300
No! No!

50:40.500 --> 50:43.100
Go on, go! Grab her, grab her!
You got her?

50:43.800 --> 50:47.300
It seems congratulations are in order,
Chris.

50:47.500 --> 50:48.900
Thank you, sir.

50:49.300 --> 50:51.200
I'm glad she finally told you.

50:51.400 --> 50:55.000
Well, tradition might have had you
coming to me first.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.500
Yeah, I realize that.

50:56.700 --> 51:00.600
And I wanted to, I really did, but she
made me promise not to say anything.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.900
She's really careful
when it comes to you, sir.

51:03.100 --> 51:06.800
-Let me out! Let me out!
-Come on, Elena.

51:06.900 --> 51:09.600
-You're doing great. Come on.
-Elena, take my foot!

51:09.800 --> 51:13.300
Grab my ankle.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

51:16.800 --> 51:19.400
-You can do it. That's it, just hold on.
-I can't breathe.

51:25.100 --> 51:26.600
No.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.700
Elena?

51:37.900 --> 51:39.700
We're gonna go up now.

52:04.200 --> 52:06.000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:08.200 --> 52:09.400
I'm stuck!

52:09.600 --> 52:13.500
Oh, my God. He's stuck.
Please, get me out! Get me out!

52:13.700 --> 52:18.100
-Get me out, out, out!
-Hey, calm down, calm down.

52:19.900 --> 52:21.600
Get me out of here.

52:21.800 --> 52:25.200
Elena, you need to reach up
and help him.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.700
I need you to reach up and help him.
Reach up.

52:34.500 --> 52:37.900
-Conor. Conor, can you crawl up here?
-Yeah.

52:38.800 --> 52:41.100
Get me out! Get me out!

52:41.500 --> 52:43.500
Get me out of here!

52:47.900 --> 52:50.800
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.100
Now, you feel that screw
on the other side?

52:54.300 --> 52:56.300
-Yeah.
-Turn it to the left.

52:57.100 --> 52:58.500
You got it?

52:58.700 --> 53:00.600
Elena. Elena.

53:00.700 --> 53:05.000
Hey, hey. Nelson tells me you're on
your way to see your little brother.

53:06.500 --> 53:08.400
Is he older or younger?

53:08.600 --> 53:10.400
-He's younger.
-Younger?

53:10.500 --> 53:12.600
Yeah, he was always so small.

53:12.700 --> 53:16.800
Elena, you don't want your little brother
to think you didn't come.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.300
You understand?

53:18.500 --> 53:21.600
-No. I'm too scared!
-Just reach up and grab Nelson's foot.

53:21.700 --> 53:22.900
-Come on.
-Please.

53:23.100 --> 53:24.400
Promise me I get to see him!

53:24.600 --> 53:26.400
-Reach up and grab his foot!
-Push my foot.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.100
Promise me I get to see him!

53:28.300 --> 53:31.500
Okay, I promise.
I promise you'll see him, just reach up.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.700
There you go. There you go!

53:34.900 --> 53:36.200
Now push!

53:36.800 --> 53:39.200
Just breathe. Come on, you got it!

53:39.800 --> 53:42.700
Push, Elena.
Push him up! That's it, Elena!

53:42.900 --> 53:45.800
Push! You got it, there, yeah!

53:47.200 --> 53:49.500
You got it, there you go!

53:49.700 --> 53:51.300
I did it, I did it, I did it.

53:51.500 --> 53:54.800
-Oh, thank you.
-Now climb!

53:55.600 --> 53:57.700
-Hurry, hurry!
-Come on, do it again.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.200
It's-- It's too tight.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.600
Oh, my God.

54:03.100 --> 54:04.900
How are we going up there?

54:05.100 --> 54:06.400
We're working on it.

54:08.600 --> 54:11.700
We need something up here
we could use as a screwdriver.

54:11.900 --> 54:13.300
A coin, a ring, anything.

54:13.400 --> 54:15.000
I can't even get into my pockets.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.000
Wait, wait!

54:20.900 --> 54:22.600
<i>Oy vey</i>, that would be ironic.

54:26.600 --> 54:30.100
Conor, you're gonna do this.
Don't worry. Here we go.

54:30.300 --> 54:32.500
Hurry! Hurry!

54:34.800 --> 54:35.800
Hurry up!

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
-Okay, turn it to the left.
-Okay.

54:38.100 --> 54:39.600
Come on.

54:39.700 --> 54:42.400
Can you reach it? Don't drop it.

54:43.700 --> 54:44.900
Come on!

54:45.100 --> 54:47.200
-Is that working?
-Yeah.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.200
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

54:51.400 --> 54:53.500
Come on, we got it.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.600
Don't worry, sweetie,
Dylan's right behind me.

55:23.600 --> 55:26.000
This thing's sealed from the other side!

55:26.400 --> 55:27.900
It's the only way out.

55:29.300 --> 55:32.200
-Except for this, maybe.
-Another vent? No, not again.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.600
No, wait a minute. What's this up here?

55:36.200 --> 55:38.100
Dylan, give me your hand.

55:39.300 --> 55:40.900
I need somebody's help!

55:51.300 --> 55:52.600
-We'll be okay.
-Got it.

55:52.700 --> 55:54.700
There you go. Any idea where we are?

55:54.900 --> 55:57.400
We got two more levels after this,
come on.

56:00.700 --> 56:02.100
Got him?

56:11.800 --> 56:13.700
Oh, my God. What is this place?

56:13.900 --> 56:17.600
This is a ballast tank. They fill these up
to keep the ship stable.

56:17.800 --> 56:21.500
That valve right there leads to the tank
next door. That may be our way through.

56:21.700 --> 56:23.200
May be? What other way is there?

56:23.300 --> 56:26.400
It's a pressure valve. It won't open
unless there's tremendous pressure.

56:26.600 --> 56:29.700
-Oh, don't tell us we're trapped.
-No, no, it'll open.

56:29.900 --> 56:31.100
How?

56:31.300 --> 56:34.600
By flooding this entire tank.

56:35.100 --> 56:36.800
-What?
-Exactly.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.400
-No. You don't even know if it's gonna open!
-That's insane. It's nuts.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.500
-Wait a minute. We drown ourselves?
-No. No one's drowning.

56:43.700 --> 56:44.900
That valve will open...

56:45.000 --> 56:48.800
...and the water'll carry us from one tank
to the next till we find an open hatch.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.900
-How do we know there's an open hatch?
-Or if we can find it...

56:52.100 --> 56:54.500
-...before we run out of air?
-It's our only option!

56:54.700 --> 56:57.200
What about the a.c. vent down there?
We never tried that.

56:57.400 --> 56:59.600
-Let's try the new vent.
-I can't go. I'm sorry.

56:59.700 --> 57:02.100
-Just go without me.
-Mom, the water's coming!

57:02.200 --> 57:03.500
Get away.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.200
-Dylan, listen to me.
-We need to make a decision.

57:12.400 --> 57:15.200
You better be right. Flood it.

57:15.400 --> 57:17.600
-Oh, my God.
-Everybody, back up. Get back!

57:17.800 --> 57:19.800
-What? No.
-Dylan, you can't.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.500
-Now, get back there.
-Jen, come here. Come here, honey.

57:23.700 --> 57:26.800
-Get back! Back up! Ready?
-Just open the valve!

57:30.900 --> 57:33.900
-Now! Over here!
-All right, stay calm.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.100
-Come on, just grab on!
-I can't--

57:46.600 --> 57:47.900
Nelson!

57:48.800 --> 57:50.100
Nelson.

57:53.900 --> 57:55.700
Hang onto the side!

57:56.500 --> 57:58.400
-Chris!
-Baby, hold on tight!

57:58.600 --> 57:59.800
-That's it.
-Oh, my God!

58:02.300 --> 58:04.400
-Start swimming!
-Hold on, baby!

58:04.500 --> 58:05.800
Hold on!

58:18.000 --> 58:19.400
Get away from it!

59:41.000 --> 59:42.600
You okay?

59:42.800 --> 59:44.200
Come on!

59:51.800 --> 59:53.100
Dad!

59:54.400 --> 59:56.400
-You all right?
-Yeah.

59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.900
Where's Dylan? Dylan!

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.100
Where's Dylan? Can you see him?

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:08.800
There's a-- There's an open hatch.
Right here. Take a deep breath.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.600
-We're gonna go through.
-How far?

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.300
-Take a deep breath!
-Right here.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.100
-Is there a way out?
-I'm sure there is.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.600
-Maggie!
-Okay.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.400
-Maggie, give him to me.
-No, I've got him.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.200
Let me take him. I was a swimmer
in high school. I tell you, I got him.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.200
Where's Nelson and Elena?

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.600
They were right behind me.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.700
Sweetie, move back.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.300
Come on, breathe!

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.300
Come on, everybody.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.700
Come on.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.200
You were never on the swim team.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.700
Nope.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.000
Think we got a hallway here.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.400
Let's go.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.800
All right. Come on, come on.
There we go. There we go.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.300
Here.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.700
Conor, go back to Dylan!

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.800
Hang on a second.
Wait, wait, wait!

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.400
What is it?

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.500
-It's a rescue.
-Hello!

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.000
-Hey, hello! Hello!
-Hello!

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.500
-Hello!
-We're inside!

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.100
-Hello!
-Is anybody there?

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.800
-Hello!
-Hello!

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.200
-Hey, we're here!
-Can you hear us?

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.200
-Hello!
-We're here!

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.100
Hello? What is it?

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.100
It's nothing.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.600
Flash fire.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:54.000
Superheats the air.
Burns the lungs like rice paper.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.800
Hey, guys. Down here. Down here.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.400
-What do you got?
-Down this corridor is the bow, right?

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.100
There's an access hatch right there
that puts us into the bow-thruster room.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:19.000
We get into the propeller tubes and the
only thing between us and the outside...

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.100
-...is nothing.
-All right. Let's go.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.300
Let's go. That's our way out.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.100
All the way to the end, and up the hatch.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.700
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.200
Conor!

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.800
-Bow's underwater.
-What does that mean?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.700
-The thrusters are under there.
-How far? Maybe we can swim.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.200
No. It's too far.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.500
There's something else we can do, right?

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.500
What do you think?

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.000
Hey.

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.400
All right.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.399
All right, we gotta get back up
to high ground.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.100
We're gonna find another way out of here.
Break into twos.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.000
Everybody start looking for
an emergency exit, any exit. Let's go.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.700
Come on.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.000
Have you found anything?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.100
Nothing. There's just no way out.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:37.500
You know, there's nothing fair
about who lives and dies.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.300
You gave Elena a chance.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.600
You gave everybody a chance.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
You did great.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.900
-What is that?
-Oh, my God, not again. Conor!

01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.600
Conor!

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.400
Maggie!

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.900
That cleared the bow!
Come on, let's go! Come on.

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.200
We can get out now.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.900
Come on.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.300
You go.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.800
Maggie! Maggie!

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.800
Maggie!

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.600
Maggie!

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400
Oh, my God.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.500
Maggie. Maggie. Hey, hey.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.300
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.600
-Conor! Conor!
-Are you okay?

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.300
Maggie, we'll find him. We'll find him.
Come on. Come on!

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.700
Conor!

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
That's gotta be the propeller tube.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.300
Come on!
Come on, look for an opening.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.100
What is that?

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:13.600
No. No. No. No, Nelson, don't!

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.800
-I got him. Come on.
-Lift.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.900
Pick him up. Ease back.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.100
Watch his head.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.000
-Conor!
-Conor!

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.700
Mom!

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.300
Mom!

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.400
Conor!

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.500
Chris. Chris, come here!

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.600
You gotta hurry,
the water's rising fast!

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.500
I wanna show you something. Here.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.000
Here. Take a look at this.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.600
The control room for these engines
is down this ladder...

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.800
...and through about
150 feet of water.

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.300
We have to get there and shut them off.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.900
No. No, look, we'll grab a bunch
of this junk, right?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.700
We throw it up into the props,
and it'll jam everything up.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.200
The propellers are turning the wrong way.
It'll kick everything back in.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.600
Chris, we need to shut them off.

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.300
-Conor!
-Conor!

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.800
Honey.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:48.000
-Honey!
-I'm in here!

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.400
-Conor?
-Mom!

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.800
Maggie, here!

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.200
Honey!

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.300
Oh, God. Oh, honey.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.800
-How'd you get in there?
-I don't know, but the water's really high.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.300
Look at me. Dylan's here,
and we're gonna get you out, okay?

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.000
Oh, my God, he's gone under! Conor!

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.000
Okay, look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me, okay?

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.500
I can't, I can't. I can't stay up.

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:24.700
-I can't find an access hatch.
-Baby, look at me. Look at me.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.200
-I can't, I can't.
-Yes, you can.

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.000
-I can't stay up, Mom.
-Yes, you can.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.800
But no one can swim that far.
We'll find another way.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.200
You know how much I love you.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:54.300
Yes. Yes, but don't do this.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.300
-Dad. Dad, please!
-You're not gonna make it, sir.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:03.200
You just won't! I mean, come on,
it's ridiculous. It's too far, you know it.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.900
But I think that I could make it.
I think I could do it on one breath.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.400
How would you get back?
You'd already be out of air.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.300
One of us has to do this, all right?

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.800
It has to be the one that has the best
chance of making it, and that's me.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.900
-Tell me I'm wrong.
-Dad.

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.700
You're not.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.900
Chris...

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:29.000
-...thank you.
-Yeah.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.000
Baby, I need you to tell me
that you love me.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.100
I need to hear it. It's all that matters.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.800
Sir, I need you to tell me how l--

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.700
Daddy!

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.100
No! Daddy!

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.700
-Nothing.
-No, please!

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.700
Look, baby, the water's gonna rise,
and I am right here, okay?

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:32.500
I'm right beside this wall
touching you, okay?

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.000
I love you, Mom.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.200
You have to be strong. I love you,
and I am here with you, okay?

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.700
Dylan!

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.800
-Oh, baby.
-Mom.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.800
-Sweetie.
-Mom.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.100
Jenny. Jen, listen.

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.100
Come on.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.700
Okay, it's here.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.700
Robert! Robert!

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.100
Dylan, over here!

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.900
-Where's Robert?
-The engines were running.

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.600
Control room's underwater. He wouldn't
let me go. He shut them down.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.700
How long? How long?!

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.200
Wait! What's that?

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:26.700
Why are they still running?

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.200
He reversed the engines!
He's creating suction!

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.300
And we can throw junk up
into the props!

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:38.800
He's a genius!

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.400
Chris! The red tank!

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.600
Get back! Get back!

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.600
No!

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.500
I can't. I can't.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.100
No!

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.600
Dylan!

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.700
Get out!

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.600
Dylan, no!

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.400
-Come on! Give me Conor!
-I'll take him.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.800
Come on! Stay there.

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.800
Jen, come on, we gotta go.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.200
Jen, we gotta go now. Come on.

01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.400
We gotta jump.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:15.800
Get to the raft.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:19.200
Got it?
Hold on tight, honey!

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.800
Can you grab him? Grab him.
You got him?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.900
-Guys, move!
-Oh, my God!

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.300
-No! Come on!
-Climb up!

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.900
Come on!

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.000
Come on, paddle!

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.300
Paddle!

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.100
Mom!

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.200
Ready?

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.800
Flare!

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.300
-Mom!
-There. There they are!

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.700
-Yeah!
-Look, Mom!

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:11.400
-Oh, baby.
-Mom.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.400
Mom!

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
We're over here!
