WEBVTT

00:08.100 --> 00:09.590
mean:
Prey/ous/y on
scream...

00:09.610 --> 00:10.429
(screams)

00:10.440 --> 00:13.364
Tyler o'neill is my main
person of interest.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.974
Tyler's not some
closet slasher psycho.

00:15.980 --> 00:18.403
Audrey:
You are beat/27ml.

00:18.410 --> 00:19.775
You and mm filmed
me and rachel.

00:19.780 --> 00:23.011
She posted it
all over the web,
and now she's dead.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.511
Are you a virgin?
So many girl...

00:25.520 --> 00:27.954
Brooke, this
cannot end well.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.656
I miss you.
Then grow a pair
and come get me.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.481
Em, where you going?
You slept with nina!

00:33.500 --> 00:33.989
Wait.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.322
And any
cyber-connection to nina,
'cause it doesn't exist.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.218
Correct?
Jake:
Absolute/y.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.298
(phone rings)
hello?

00:40.300 --> 00:42.894
Man: (on phone)
hi.
This Is gpp security.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.333
You get that WIhdow
locked up tight?

00:45.340 --> 00:46.329
Wait...

00:46.340 --> 00:47.602
What do you
want from me?

00:47.610 --> 00:48.907
To show you
the truth, emma.

00:48.910 --> 00:52.209
Everyone you trust
is lying to you.

00:52.210 --> 00:53.802
Your whore of a mother.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.447
It all started
with her, emma.

00:55.450 --> 00:58.089
But its gonna
end with you.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.657
(panﬁng)

01:07.460 --> 01:10.429
Look out! Oh, oh,
brett, thank god!

01:10.430 --> 01:11.328
Oh, what is
happening?

01:11.330 --> 01:12.866
That freak
went crazy.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.088
Shh! I think
he's close.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.534
What did you
do to him?

01:17.540 --> 01:19.269
What he deserved.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.237
(chokes)

01:24.010 --> 01:24.999
Dara?

01:25.010 --> 01:26.568
(choking)

01:27.250 --> 01:30.310
Oh, god!
Oh, my god!

01:30.320 --> 01:34.086
You stay the hell away
from me, psycho!

01:38.530 --> 01:40.054
(grunts)

01:46.070 --> 01:50.029
No, no, no, no.
(breath trembling)

01:50.040 --> 01:51.530
Ahhh!

01:54.340 --> 01:56.376
Please, don't!

01:56.380 --> 01:58.302
(screams)

02:01.880 --> 02:04.849
Halloween night,
1994 was a bitch

02:04.850 --> 02:07.011
For dara aldean
and brett kenner,

02:07.020 --> 02:08.556
Victims one and two.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.120
Of course,
no one knows exactly

02:11.130 --> 02:13.086
What their last
words were.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.954
Except maybe
brandon james.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.224
So, noah foster,

02:17.230 --> 02:21.018
Do you think that
brandon james just
snapped that night?

02:21.040 --> 02:21.790
Nobody just snaps.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.531
I mean, a bomb
doesn't become a bomb
when the wick is lit.

02:25.540 --> 02:30.830
So if tyler o'neill
is behind the mask
in the gif,

02:30.850 --> 02:33.068
Is this an homage?

02:33.080 --> 02:34.616
In my humble opinion,

02:34.620 --> 02:35.518
Nobody puts on a mask

02:35.520 --> 02:38.182
And commits a murder
like that just once.

02:38.190 --> 02:41.512
The real question is,
who's next?

02:45.690 --> 02:49.421
So we are officially
dealing with another
possible murder.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.125
I was up all night
finishing the autopsy.

02:51.130 --> 02:54.566
The ligature marks,
dislocated vertebrae,
crushed larynx...

02:54.570 --> 02:56.561
You don't see
this kind of trauma

02:56.570 --> 02:57.730
Hanging yourself from an

02:57.740 --> 02:58.832
Eight-foot-high ceiling fan.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.865
So someone staged
her body

03:00.880 --> 03:02.575
To look like a suicide.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.002
Why would they do that?

03:04.010 --> 03:05.602
Wish i knew.

03:06.780 --> 03:08.441
Rachel's wake's today.

03:08.450 --> 03:10.771
Let her family have
a day to mourn.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.418
Tomorrow, i'll open
a murder investigation.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.651
(sighs) a mother's
worst nightmare.

03:17.790 --> 03:20.827
Any more packages
arrive at your door?

03:20.830 --> 03:22.195
Not since the heart.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.952
Which i can't stop
thinking about.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.791
I'm still trying
to locate your ex.

03:27.900 --> 03:28.798
Have you told emma?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.995
Mmm-mmm.
No, maybe i should.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.763
I'm trying to protect her.
She's dealing with enough.

03:33.780 --> 03:39.047
And it'll bring up
questions about my past
that i just can't answer.

03:47.090 --> 03:49.354
(cell phone chimes)

04:06.340 --> 04:07.932
(laughs)

04:08.480 --> 04:12.109
I'm sorry, but cyber-sex
is not what i had in mind

04:12.110 --> 04:13.270
When i told you
to grow a pair.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.410
(mr. Branson groans)
god you are
k/i/ing me right now.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.978
You're killing yourself.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.551
You could be here with me,
in this five-star suite

04:22.560 --> 04:25.529
Instead of testing
our tantric limits online.

04:25.530 --> 04:30.092
cyber-boundar/es, brooke.
Safer that way.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.421
Why are you
/'n a hotel?

04:32.430 --> 04:34.591
It's my mother's
standing room.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.532
I come here for
spa weekends

04:35.540 --> 04:39.135
When she's on one of
her spiritual retreats.

04:39.140 --> 04:42.177
Which, lately, is always.

04:42.180 --> 04:43.499
Sounds complicated

04:43.510 --> 04:44.602
Your game is boring.

04:44.610 --> 04:47.647
Mine is much
more eXCItIng.

04:47.650 --> 04:48.378
I’m l/sten/ng.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.769
There is a very, very
naughty picture of me

04:50.790 --> 04:52.815
Hidden somewhere
In your classroom.

04:52.820 --> 04:56.358
You might wanna find it
before someone else does.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.509
Happy hunting,
mr. Branson.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.556
Wait wait wait wait
wait wait hrooke, no.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.272
(grunting)

05:38.570 --> 05:40.265
Son of a bitch!

05:42.440 --> 05:45.068
(indistinct chatter)

06:09.630 --> 06:11.791
Oh, rachel.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.304
Audrey!
Hey, hey! No, don't.

06:54.310 --> 06:55.436
Here...
Get off me!

06:55.440 --> 06:57.203
Were you just trying to...
No. I was...

06:57.210 --> 06:59.940
I was just testing
to see if _it's
even pOSSIble.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.201
What are you
doing here?

07:01.220 --> 07:03.313
Emma, this is
rachel's wake.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.584
Rachel didn't
kill herself.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.314
What?

07:07.320 --> 07:09.982
My mom found something
in the autopsy.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.380
The sheriff's opening
a murder investigation.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.219
I knew it.

07:16.230 --> 07:19.165
I knew rachel
wouldn't kill herself.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.791
But who would
want to kill her?

07:24.210 --> 07:25.768
I don't know.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.835
I'm really sorry,
i've gotta go.

07:28.840 --> 07:31.308
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.774
Seriously?

07:33.780 --> 07:36.749
Emma, you just did
your hair twirl thing.

07:38.350 --> 07:40.443
What's going on?

07:42.220 --> 07:43.812
(music playing)

07:47.060 --> 07:48.618
(music stops)

08:00.110 --> 08:01.702
Will!

08:02.180 --> 08:05.104
Will! We got
a serious-ass
problem, dude.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.749
The money is gone!
I think tyler took it.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.308
No, he didn't.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.314
I took it.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.618
What? Red card, dude.
Took it where?

08:12.620 --> 08:15.054
Oh, you should be thanking
me that i got to the cash

08:15.060 --> 08:15.856
Before tyler could.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.885
Not your decision.
We're partners.

08:17.890 --> 08:22.259
Well, you promised
to shut down our little
operation, partner.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.989
And i know you haven't.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.297
Idid!

08:26.270 --> 08:27.396
Okay. I considered
your request.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.267
But you're not seeing
the upside of keeping
this thing going.

08:30.270 --> 08:33.000
That's because
i don't have a rich
daddy like you do.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.534
(sighs)
they trace this
back to us,

08:34.540 --> 08:38.340
It's game over.
My scholarship. Emma.

08:38.350 --> 08:39.908
Everything.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.376
(sighs)

08:42.850 --> 08:45.239
Come on, bro.
Where's the cash?

08:46.460 --> 08:47.609
Shut it all down.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.713
And maybe
you'll find out.

08:50.060 --> 08:51.311
Bro.

09:01.270 --> 09:02.567
At first, i thought it
was just some loser

09:02.570 --> 09:05.300
Playing with his new voice
changer app on his phone.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.266
But he won't
leave me alone.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.077
So you think some
deranged stalker

09:09.080 --> 09:11.139
Killed rachel
to hurt you?

09:11.150 --> 09:14.449
Look, i know that
i sound deranged.

09:14.450 --> 09:16.338
I don't know.
Maybe i am.

09:16.350 --> 09:20.446
But this guy acted
like he knew me.

09:20.460 --> 09:24.157
He said he wanted
to show me the truth.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.987
Have you told your mom?

09:26.190 --> 09:27.054
I was going to,

09:27.060 --> 09:30.154
But she's the one
he told me not to trust.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.763
What if you
wrote him back?

09:35.270 --> 09:35.964
What?

09:35.970 --> 09:37.369
If this psycho
did kill rachel,

09:37.370 --> 09:39.736
I wanna know
the reason why.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.633
He dmd you, right?

09:41.640 --> 09:42.629
Yeah.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.130
He opened a line.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.301
Let's direct message
his ass back.

10:06.970 --> 10:08.835
Now we wait.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.628
(bell rings)
(indistinct chatter)

10:12.640 --> 10:14.505
(sighs) i still
haven't heard from noah.

10:14.510 --> 10:16.933
Everything was going
great on the football field,

10:16.950 --> 10:19.999
Then he raced off like
the mcrib was back.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.612
He's clearly afraid
to make a move,

10:21.620 --> 10:26.148
And you're too gorge
for these roma_ntic
specnal olymplcs.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.015
Don't be mean.
(chuckles)

10:28.020 --> 10:30.716
Not mean.
Brutally honest.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.618
It's a different
shade of mean.

10:32.630 --> 10:34.052
Speaking of...
(clicks tongue)

10:34.060 --> 10:35.391
Wait. Is that
nina's lipstick?

10:35.400 --> 10:40.360
Yeah, well, someone's
got to fill the lipstick
power vacuum.

10:40.370 --> 10:44.295
Oh, come on. She'd love
that i was carrying
on her legacy.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.801
(scoffs) right, em?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.332
Em?
What?

10:50.710 --> 10:51.938
What is with you?

10:51.950 --> 10:54.874
Seriously, em.
You okay?

10:54.880 --> 10:55.539
It's just...

10:55.550 --> 10:58.849
You're not still beating
yourself up about that
saint mary's chick, right?

10:58.850 --> 11:03.878
Because i'm sorry
for audrey, but that
was not your fault.

11:03.890 --> 11:06.051
No. It's just...

11:06.060 --> 11:10.997
_I can't believe that
nina's gone, you know.

11:12.430 --> 11:15.092
She's with us in spirit.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.205
(indistinct chatter)

11:22.210 --> 11:24.303
Oh, hey, em.

11:24.510 --> 11:26.774
Um, you got a second?

11:30.150 --> 11:31.845
(thuds)

11:32.190 --> 11:34.647
I, uh, found this
in my truck.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.287
Didn't feel right
hanging onto it.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.520
I'm like three ipod
generations past that.

11:38.530 --> 11:42.728
Actually, i don't
even think i've used
the word ipod in months.

11:42.730 --> 11:43.697
(chuckles) yeah,

11:43.700 --> 11:48.160
But do any of them have
your endless beach day
playlist on 'em?

11:48.370 --> 11:49.394
Oh, my god. (laughs)

11:49.400 --> 11:52.938
Wow, that day that
you almost drowned
your truck at the launch.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.534
Hey, who knew that boat
was gonna be so heavy?

11:55.540 --> 11:56.939
(both laughing)

11:56.950 --> 12:00.306
Yeah. Yeah, that
was a good day.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.519
Well, um, maybe i
should hang on to it.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.112
No way.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.251
Sentimental value.

12:14.630 --> 12:16.154
Well, see ya.

12:27.510 --> 12:29.307
(bell rings)

12:29.680 --> 12:34.174
See, aristotle asked,
"why are we here?

12:34.550 --> 12:38.270
"what is the meaning
of life in the face of death?"

12:38.290 --> 12:41.612
Bet tyler's wondering
the same thing right
about now.

12:41.620 --> 12:42.882
Thank you, jake.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.084
(laughs)

12:44.090 --> 12:45.250
See, aristotle also
understood that

12:45.260 --> 12:49.993
Volatile relationships,
well, they can lead
to tragedy.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.628
Looking for
something, mr. B?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.468
We're all looking
for something, brooke.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.701
See, desire, that's at
the heart of drama.

12:58.710 --> 13:00.564
Desire for love.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.279
Power. Money.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.077
I'm talking about
jason and medea.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.971
Talkin' about anthony
and cleopatra.

13:07.980 --> 13:11.017
I'm talkin' about
emma and kIeran.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.612
Excuse me?

13:12.820 --> 13:15.209
I'm splitting
you all into pairs.

13:18.260 --> 13:19.750
Uh, you and your partner

13:19.760 --> 13:22.490
Will choose a dramatic
scene to perform In class.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.025
Now, let's not just
limit ourselves.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.566
We can...

13:26.570 --> 13:29.289
...Choose something
contemporary, like movies.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.336
Audrey and will.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.509
If you suggest the pool
scene from
wﬂd things,

13:34.510 --> 13:35.169
I will end you.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.274
Mr. Branson: Or, if
that's too much for
your attention span,

13:38.280 --> 13:43.673
Pick a favorite tv show,
riley and noah.

13:43.920 --> 13:48.880
I'll even allow popular
fiction, jake and brooke.

13:48.890 --> 13:51.358
How about
my
shades of grey?

13:51.360 --> 13:53.157
In your dreams,
mouth-breather.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.390
All right, everybody.
Let's get going
to the library,

13:55.400 --> 13:56.719
I'm gonna pair
the rest of you
up there.

13:56.730 --> 13:59.858
Get going on these
selections. Let's go.

14:00.270 --> 14:04.798
"you have no idea how utterly
unprecedented you are."

14:05.010 --> 14:07.501
"you can't say
things like that."

14:07.510 --> 14:09.375
No, you're right.
I really can't.

14:09.380 --> 14:12.543
(laughs) okay, so
fault in our stars
IS also a no.

14:12.550 --> 14:16.418
I mean, cancer kids
on top of brutal murder
might be a bit much.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.741
Yeah. (laughs)
(cell phone chimes)

14:22.320 --> 14:25.949
Problem?
Um, just my mom,
you know.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.451
Every night is a late
night since nina.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.928
Yeah. Now my dad's
either at the station

14:30.930 --> 14:34.559
Or holed up at home with
old dusty case files.

14:34.570 --> 14:35.662
Hmm.

14:35.670 --> 14:38.264
Wait. The brandon james
case files?

14:38.270 --> 14:40.602
Those are at
your house?

14:42.310 --> 14:43.937
I'm sensing you might
wanna come over

14:43.950 --> 14:46.077
And pick out
a scene later.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.571
Maybe pick something
from old tv.

14:48.580 --> 14:49.239
X-fi/es...

14:49.250 --> 14:52.583
Look, brandon james
almost killed my dad.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.411
Somehow my mom
was involved.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.554
I need answers.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.520
I'm game.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.025
When should i come over?

15:03.300 --> 15:07.623
Actually, it might be better
if i bring them to you.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.862
Thanks.

15:16.980 --> 15:18.333
You wanna do
the exorast?

15:18.350 --> 15:21.444
It's classic. "the power
of christ compels you!"

15:21.450 --> 15:22.974
Loads of drama.

15:22.980 --> 15:23.969
Dramatic, maybe.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.048
Romantic? Not so much.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.383
You think our scene
should be romantic?

15:28.620 --> 15:32.852
I did. But you
never called, so...

15:32.860 --> 15:35.897
Riley, uh, i wanted to.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.026
Like a lot.

15:37.030 --> 15:39.066
And, you know, if i had,
i would have said,

15:39.070 --> 15:44.565
"i wanna hang out.
And be romantic. A lot."

15:45.110 --> 15:46.737
Wow. Is that shakespeare?

15:46.740 --> 15:47.559
Uh, yeah, you know it.

15:47.580 --> 15:51.505
I think it's from his
May
a mid-semester
night’s hang out.

15:52.150 --> 15:54.505
Okay, game on.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.273
But you better
impress me.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.655
(playing piano)

16:05.960 --> 16:06.688
You play?

16:06.700 --> 16:09.828
Yeah. My dad taught
me when i was little.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.194
Looks like you're pretty good.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.418
Was. I quit after he left.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.863
Maybe you can
play for me sometime.

16:16.870 --> 16:18.428
Maybe...

16:19.640 --> 16:23.178
Whoa. These are
from the crime scene.

16:23.180 --> 16:24.670
Kieran: Damn.

16:31.350 --> 16:32.612
Is that him?

16:32.620 --> 16:35.851
Yeah. Before his surgeries.

16:36.460 --> 16:37.813
He looks so scared.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.354
(cell phone chimes)

16:42.600 --> 16:44.124
I got to go.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.167
My dad's on
his way home.

16:46.170 --> 16:48.468
Oh, well, we don't
want you getting arrested.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.859
Yeah, wouldn't
be the first time.

16:51.070 --> 16:53.402
Seriously?
Tell you what.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.674
You play me
a song sometime,

16:55.680 --> 16:58.171
I'll tell you
the whole story.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.779
Your dad's name
is kevin, right?

17:04.790 --> 17:05.415
Yeah.

17:05.420 --> 17:08.617
His police statement
says that brandon james
confronted his girlfriend,

17:08.620 --> 17:11.680
And that's what
started all of this.

17:11.690 --> 17:14.454
Wait, my mom
was his girlfriend.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.427
He calls her "daisy."

17:20.670 --> 17:22.262
Oh, my god.

17:23.610 --> 17:27.068
Brandon james was
obsessed with my mom.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.810
(indistinct chatter)

17:44.560 --> 17:48.087
Christian grey's red room
of pain awaits you.
(gasps)

17:48.100 --> 17:49.124
Ugh! Ew.

17:49.130 --> 17:51.758
That would literally
be like doing my brother.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.694
50
game of thrones?
I'm cool with that.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.394
Tell you what.

17:55.400 --> 17:59.302
I'll pick the scene
and email you the lines.

17:59.510 --> 18:00.204
Now run along.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.201
Go find will
and continue tanking

18:02.210 --> 18:04.269
The school's collective iq.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.140
(sighs)

18:06.150 --> 18:09.278
What? Bromance
on the rocks?

18:10.150 --> 18:11.117
(scoffs) i got one rule.

18:11.120 --> 18:14.248
I do not abide people
i can't trust.

18:14.260 --> 18:14.783
Please.

18:14.790 --> 18:17.850
Trust is a campaign
promise. Real life?

18:17.860 --> 18:20.249
You're either
the cat or the mouse.

18:20.260 --> 18:23.457
Is that how it works
with your college beau?

18:23.470 --> 18:26.667
Don't give me that look,
i pay attention.

18:26.670 --> 18:30.094
But my question is,
how do you know?

18:30.910 --> 18:31.865
Know what?

18:31.870 --> 18:35.033
Whether you're
the cat or the mouse?

18:35.510 --> 18:36.829
You remember
that viral video

18:36.850 --> 18:40.377
Where the bobcat snatches
the shark out of the ocean?

18:40.380 --> 18:42.348
HSSKK

18:42.550 --> 18:43.369
And up to that moment,

18:43.380 --> 18:48.511
I bet you the shark
thought it was
the apex predator.

18:50.460 --> 18:54.157
Are we, um, honing
in on a point here?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.252
I'm just saying,

18:55.260 --> 18:58.127
Maybe you're not at
the top of the food chain.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.598
Maybe your boyfriend's
got you thinking bobcat.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.161
But really you're
just a shark.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.516
(door opens)

19:26.330 --> 19:27.922
Hey, honey.

19:29.630 --> 19:31.029
(sighs)

19:32.070 --> 19:34.288
Why didn't you tell
me you were daisy?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.030
Because it happened
a long time ago.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.406
And i've been trying
to put it behind me.

19:45.980 --> 19:48.278
But it isn't, is it?

19:48.550 --> 19:49.972
Someone knows.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.143
Mom, they sent you
a heart in a box.

19:53.350 --> 19:54.282
I'm dealing with it.

19:54.290 --> 19:57.657
Are you? Because i'm pretty
sure whoever is harassing you

19:57.660 --> 19:59.924
Is the same creep
that's calling me.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.899
He called you again?
Why didn't you tell me?

20:02.900 --> 20:06.119
Do you really want to start
comparing lists of secrets
right now?

20:06.130 --> 20:08.462
(sighs) what did he say?

20:09.440 --> 20:10.862
That my life is a lie.

20:10.870 --> 20:14.033
That you are a liar.
Awful things.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.530
I'm sorry.
But believe it or not,

20:15.540 --> 20:17.076
This is exactly what i was
trying to protect you from.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.800
Really? Mom, i heard you
talking to the sheriff
this morning.

20:20.820 --> 20:25.018
And it really sounded
like you were trying
to protect yourself.

20:27.020 --> 20:28.214
Unless you wanna
start talking about

20:28.220 --> 20:31.212
Those mysterious questions
you can't answer?

20:31.230 --> 20:34.950
Like, why is the
sheriff looking for dad?

20:38.500 --> 20:39.922
Nothing.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.739
(scoffs)

20:44.370 --> 20:45.803
Great.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.941
(chuckles) was this whole
cloak and dagger thing
strictly necessary?

20:52.950 --> 20:54.269
Uh, you asked
me to impress.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.748
Well, as long as
my head doesn't end
up in your freezer.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.240
Yeah, you know,
i never ugﬁerstood...

20:58.250 --> 20:59.478
...The whole head in
the freezer thing.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.742
(laughs)
brains are so much
better at body temp,

21:01.760 --> 21:03.580
You just ask
any zombie.

21:03.590 --> 21:04.955
(both laughing)

21:04.960 --> 21:06.825
Okay.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.225
I will be right back.
Okay.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.459
(thuds)

21:16.800 --> 21:18.233
Noah?

21:18.440 --> 21:20.567
Okay, now look.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.608
Is this is where you work?

21:27.620 --> 21:29.269
For a maximum
of twelve hours a week,

21:29.280 --> 21:32.818
According to department of
labor guidelines. (chuckles)

21:32.820 --> 21:35.653
It's beautiful.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.811
(chuckles) uh, when we
couldn't decide on a movie,

21:38.830 --> 21:40.582
I realized you
haven't even seen

21:40.600 --> 21:42.693
Some of the best
drama out there.

21:42.700 --> 21:43.621
It's in video games.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.791
I mean, the cutscene
that opens
the last of us?

21:45.800 --> 21:48.792
Oh, my god.
It's heartbreaking.

21:49.170 --> 21:50.831
(chuckles)

21:51.640 --> 21:53.369
You get me.

22:05.420 --> 22:07.843
(cell phone rings)

22:18.370 --> 22:20.668
Hello?
Man:
Hello, emma.

22:20.670 --> 22:21.398
I got your dm.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.937
I’ll answer
your quest/ans
when i’m ready.

22:23.940 --> 22:26.602
So, did mommy give
you the answers

22:26.610 --> 22:28.009
You were
looking for?

22:28.010 --> 22:28.999
I'm calling the police.

22:29.010 --> 22:32.377
Say anything,
and / w/l/ gut her.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.208
What do you
want from me?

22:34.220 --> 22:37.712
Isn ’t it obvious?
I want your trust, emma.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.675
Why the hell
would i trust you?

22:38.690 --> 22:42.786
Because i’m the only
one around here
telling you the truth.

22:42.790 --> 22:43.518
You're sick!

22:43.520 --> 22:47.889
I am done playing your games,
and i'm done with you.

22:49.060 --> 22:51.096
(cell phone chimes)

23:03.240 --> 23:06.243
(both moaning and chuckling)

23:08.520 --> 23:10.670
Uh, remind me to send
mr. Branson a muffin basket,

23:10.690 --> 23:14.387
Because you are
the best scene
partner ever.

23:14.390 --> 23:15.914
(chuckles)

23:17.230 --> 23:19.152
Uh, do you have a...

23:19.360 --> 23:20.281
You know?
You know,

23:20.290 --> 23:22.599
Uh, they say if you're not
mature enough to say condom,

23:22.600 --> 23:26.229
You're not mature
enough for sex.
(laughs)

23:26.230 --> 23:28.027
So do you?

23:31.970 --> 23:33.369
(laughs)

23:37.040 --> 23:37.870
(cell phone vibrates)

23:37.880 --> 23:40.144
Ah. Uh, what,
what was that?

23:40.150 --> 23:42.471
Relax, it's just my phone.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.744
(chuckling nervously)

23:46.720 --> 23:48.210
(cell phone vibrates)

23:48.220 --> 23:50.108
Okay. Um...

23:52.860 --> 23:54.350
Oh, my god.

23:58.530 --> 23:59.963
Tyler?

24:02.140 --> 24:06.565
And just before noah and i
were about to, you know,

24:06.770 --> 24:08.601
Tyler finally
texted back.

24:08.610 --> 24:09.736
He wants
our help.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.628
And you just left
the little dude hanging?

24:11.650 --> 24:13.242
Harsh.
Jake, bigger issues.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.569
Wait, did you
text him back?

24:14.580 --> 24:16.639
Yes. He said
he didn't do it,

24:16.650 --> 24:18.743
But he's afraid
that no one's going
to believe him.

24:18.750 --> 24:19.842
Brooke:
I don't believe him.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.216
I told him to turn
himself in.

24:22.220 --> 24:24.188
Wait, he texted
you, too?

24:24.190 --> 24:24.918
Same time as riley.

24:24.930 --> 24:28.354
Probably suffering from
psycho killer's remorse.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.295
Guys, i don't
think this is tyler.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.120
It was from his number.

24:33.130 --> 24:34.722
It's not him.

24:36.340 --> 24:39.138
Someone has been
calling and harassrng me.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.859
Is that what was going on
in the alley the other night?

24:41.880 --> 24:43.700
He's playing
games with me.

24:43.710 --> 24:45.974
He sent you that text
pretending to be me?

24:45.980 --> 24:48.801
Well, i'm pretty sure he's
doing the same thing again.

24:48.820 --> 24:52.119
Why would some weirdo
pretend to be tyler on us?

24:52.120 --> 24:55.886
It's hard to explain.
But i promise, you
cannot trust him.

24:55.890 --> 24:59.223
Em, i have no idea who's
screwing with you,

24:59.230 --> 25:00.288
But i know tyler.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.895
He's afraid and we
need to hear him out.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.152
Riley, we need
to go to the police.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.819
So he can get shot
like brandon james?

25:06.830 --> 25:09.298
Riles, i love you, i do.

25:09.300 --> 25:13.100
But tyler might
have killed nina.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.409
I vote cops.

25:21.450 --> 25:22.849
(scoffs)

25:24.620 --> 25:28.181
If they hurt him,
it's on you.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.052
Emma: Riley!

25:40.940 --> 25:43.738
Yo, if tyler talks
to the cops,

25:43.740 --> 25:45.332
We may go down with him.

25:45.340 --> 25:46.102
I'll text him.

25:46.110 --> 25:49.068
Tell him if he'll meet us,
we'll give him the cash.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.832
What? We will.

25:58.250 --> 26:00.013
Emma.
Mom?

26:00.020 --> 26:01.487
What are you
doing here?

26:01.490 --> 26:03.708
Sheriff hudson
called me.

26:03.720 --> 26:04.652
I'm your mom.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.059
Hudson: So we checked
phone records.

26:06.060 --> 26:09.291
(sighs) these texts were
sent from tyler's account.

26:09.300 --> 26:10.426
I told you.

26:10.430 --> 26:11.294
Wait, are you sure?

26:11.300 --> 26:12.961
Couldn't someone else
have used his phone?

26:12.970 --> 26:13.789
It's possible.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.995
But i think this is our
one shot to bring him in.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.864
Text tyler back.

26:16.870 --> 26:21.136
You know, ask him to meet up.
Someplace public, but
where he feels comfortable.

26:21.140 --> 26:23.506
Like the park
on route nine.

26:23.980 --> 26:26.198
I don't know.
I don't wanna lie.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.939
Riley, i would
do it, i would.

26:27.950 --> 26:31.408
But tyler knows i
would totally set him up.

26:31.420 --> 26:32.842
You, on the other hand,
are an angel.

26:32.850 --> 26:36.217
Listen, i know that
you feel like you're
betraying your friend.

26:36.220 --> 26:40.122
But if he's innocent,
this is his best _chance
to prove It.

26:40.130 --> 26:42.086
It's his only chance.

26:44.230 --> 26:45.322
It's gonna be okay.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.594
We're doing
the right thing.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.398
Are you trying
to convince me, or you?

27:06.620 --> 27:08.281
Let's do this.

27:08.490 --> 27:09.718
_Aren't we
waiting for tyler?

27:09.720 --> 27:11.779
I'm sure he's
on his way.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.951
Money talks.
Let's dig.

27:14.260 --> 27:17.149
You didn't text him.
Did you?

27:17.160 --> 27:20.163
Do i detect a lack
of trust, will?

27:20.170 --> 27:22.161
That's hysterical.

27:25.870 --> 27:28.862
You didn't stash
the cash here, did you?

27:28.880 --> 27:29.801
This is nina, man.

27:29.810 --> 27:32.847
She's dead and she's still
pitting us against each other.

27:32.850 --> 27:34.249
And i told you how
to get out of it.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.547
I'm not gonna
risk everything
i've worked for

27:35.550 --> 27:39.987
Just because
you're still caught up
in her blackmail drama.

27:42.860 --> 27:43.781
You don't get it, will.

27:43.790 --> 27:45.758
There is no
way out of this.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.820
So we can help
each other. Or not.

27:48.830 --> 27:52.618
But then it's every
man for himself.

28:15.590 --> 28:18.252
Riley's nearing
the rendezvous.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.728
Nobody makes a
move until i say so.

28:22.630 --> 28:24.325
(door creaks)

28:38.250 --> 28:41.504
He's not here.
Do i wait?

28:47.590 --> 28:49.979
Hold on, hold on.
Vehicle's approaching.

28:49.990 --> 28:53.448
Everyone stay alert.
Stay alert.

29:00.230 --> 29:02.198
I'm gonna get a water.

29:04.940 --> 29:06.134
I hate this waiting.

29:06.140 --> 29:09.576
If anything goes wrong,
riley is never gonna
forgive us.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.371
It won't.

29:11.380 --> 29:13.575
But if it did,
she would.

29:14.250 --> 29:14.944
But it won't.

29:14.950 --> 29:16.417
(cell phone chimes)
(gasps)

29:16.420 --> 29:20.686
(sighs) jesus. When this is
over, we need a spa day.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.346
Who is it?

29:22.360 --> 29:25.750
Oh, um, it's my dad.

29:26.430 --> 29:27.852
I'll be back.

29:49.550 --> 29:53.714
Okay, come on out.
Come on out.
Let him see you.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.358
Stay close.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.397
All right, all right,
he's making his move.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.878
Police! Show
me your hands!

30:22.880 --> 30:23.949
(grunts)
(sirens wailing)

30:23.950 --> 30:25.315
Man: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hold on!

30:25.320 --> 30:26.582
Hold on. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, hang on.

30:26.590 --> 30:28.012
Wait, this wasn't my idea.
What are you doing here?

30:28.020 --> 30:30.488
Some guy on the internet paid
me 200 bucks to drive here.

30:30.490 --> 30:31.957
And said to give
this to some girl.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.154
What?
Check my front pocket.

30:33.160 --> 30:36.197
Check my pocket.
(grunts)
put your hand in there.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.797
What?

30:41.270 --> 30:42.669
What is it?

30:53.350 --> 30:54.840
Riles.

30:54.850 --> 30:58.445
Talk to me.
What're you
thinking about?

30:58.450 --> 30:59.940
Besides tyler?

31:00.690 --> 31:02.112
Noah.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.389
(chuckles)

31:03.390 --> 31:05.813
We were having
this amazing time,

31:05.830 --> 31:07.354
And ijust bailed.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.590
Jake's right,
it was harsh.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.866
Ijust really
like him, emma.

31:12.870 --> 31:17.432
I have a feeling that
he'll probably give you
a second chance.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.203
Margaret: Tyler set them up.

31:21.210 --> 31:22.131
He didn't show.

31:22.140 --> 31:24.574
But he said
he'd be there.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.945
Where's brooke?

31:30.580 --> 31:32.241
Where the hell is she?

31:34.990 --> 31:38.357
Glad you finally
came to your senses.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.853
Mr. Branson?

31:46.070 --> 31:47.719
Hello...

32:06.020 --> 32:08.215
(cell phone vibrates)

32:11.060 --> 32:12.789
Margaret: I wonder
if riley's had any luck?

32:12.790 --> 32:13.882
We've checked
brooke's house.

32:13.890 --> 32:17.098
I can keep driving,
but is there anywhere else
she might be?

32:17.100 --> 32:18.021
I don't know.

32:18.030 --> 32:20.726
Let me check in
with the sheriff.

32:22.470 --> 32:26.236
I'm gonna put the word out.
See if anyone's seen brooke.

32:26.470 --> 32:27.869
Margaret: Hey.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.099
No, i'm with emma.
We're trying to find brooke.

32:32.980 --> 32:33.503
No.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.001
No, she's not at
the maddox house.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.842
(mutters)

32:41.090 --> 32:42.819
What do you have?

32:43.760 --> 32:45.250
All right.

32:45.260 --> 32:48.252
I don't know. I guess
we can keep driving.

32:48.560 --> 32:52.098
(phone rings)
yeah, i just got to ﬁgure
out where else to look.

32:53.270 --> 32:54.464
Are you okay?
Where are you?

32:54.470 --> 32:56.734
. The station.
D/d you find brooke?

32:56.740 --> 32:59.095
Stay put.
I’m coming.

33:08.350 --> 33:11.774
We should get back
to the station.

33:19.260 --> 33:20.921
(cell phone chimes)

33:32.510 --> 33:34.159
(cell phone chimes)

34:24.430 --> 34:25.886
Tyler?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.899
(sighs)

34:49.020 --> 34:50.373
Tyler?

34:58.530 --> 34:59.827
(gasps)

34:59.830 --> 35:01.422
Help!

35:01.630 --> 35:03.723
Someone help me!

35:04.060 --> 35:06.221

35:10.970 --> 35:12.699

35:12.710 --> 35:14.962

35:28.090 --> 35:31.116

35:52.810 --> 35:54.778
(crying) help me!

35:54.780 --> 35:56.407
Help!

35:56.420 --> 35:59.071
Help me!

36:00.720 --> 36:02.779

36:04.160 --> 36:06.856
(cell phone rings)

36:11.430 --> 36:12.920
Noah!

36:13.130 --> 36:14.222
Riley! Riley, oh, my god!

36:14.230 --> 36:16.164
Uh, where are you?
What's happening?

36:16.170 --> 36:19.333
He stabbed me.
(stutters)

36:19.340 --> 36:20.659
Please call 9]].

36:20.670 --> 36:22.604
Who stabbed you?
Where are you?

36:22.610 --> 36:25.738
(crying)
on the roof. Tyler.

36:25.750 --> 36:29.174
(gasping) he's gone.

36:29.180 --> 36:30.147
Hey, riley, where are you?

36:30.150 --> 36:32.914
Just look around.
Just tell me what
you can see!

36:32.920 --> 36:35.980
(panﬁng)

36:39.560 --> 36:42.381
I can see our stars.

36:42.400 --> 36:47.861
No! Riley, hey, no.
Hey, you have to stay
with me, okay? Please.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.758
Please!

36:50.800 --> 36:53.963
R/ley? R/ley?

36:57.180 --> 37:01.799
Okay. This gives new
meaning to anticlimactic.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.219
(sighs)

37:23.400 --> 37:26.062
(beeping)

37:30.210 --> 37:32.098
Brooke! Thank god!

37:32.110 --> 37:34.408
She's okay.
Where are you?

37:34.410 --> 37:36.719
In a nightmare
of my own making.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.041
Okay, seriously,
it might not be safe.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.587
Trust me, it's too safe.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.012
Riley's gone.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.908
I gotta go.
Emma?

37:44.930 --> 37:48.627
A deputy saw a car that
looked like tyler's
leave the station.

37:48.630 --> 37:50.951
They're going after it now.

37:54.130 --> 37:55.461
Everybody stop!

37:55.470 --> 37:57.358
(cell phone ringing)

38:00.710 --> 38:02.166
Oh!

38:04.210 --> 38:05.177
No!

38:05.180 --> 38:07.148
(cries)
emma, wait!

38:07.150 --> 38:08.469
Woman: (on radio)
suspect tyler o ’ne/ll.

38:08.480 --> 38:13.042
Vehicle reported crashed

on l(/'nca/d bridge.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.249

38:41.110 --> 38:42.600
Riley!

38:43.820 --> 38:46.118
(sobbin
riley! g)

38:46.720 --> 38:48.244
No.

38:50.390 --> 38:53.257
I didn't mean
to choose.

39:01.270 --> 39:03.465
Woman:
lVext t/me on
scream...

39:03.470 --> 39:06.462
Noah: I don't understand.
Who would kill her?

39:06.470 --> 39:09.337
I need to know.
So do i.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.072
Hudson: Is_this
tyler o'neill?

39:11.080 --> 39:12.775
We can't seem
to find his head.

39:12.780 --> 39:15.442
Man:
Vl/ithho/d/ng
from the police,
naughty, naughty.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.008
Why didn't you
come straight here?

39:17.020 --> 39:18.442
Because the last
time i came here

39:18.450 --> 39:19.712
It didn't really
end that well.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.211
You think the killer
is still out there.

39:22.220 --> 39:23.209
There is another option.

39:26.230 --> 39:29.051
_ Emma: .
The l(/l/ers send/ng me
some weird message.

39:29.060 --> 39:30.357
lVoah:
A yearbook?

39:30.360 --> 39:32.499
(reading)

39:32.500 --> 39:35.526
Oh, holy manson
family album.

39:35.540 --> 39:36.768
It's a great lead.

39:36.770 --> 39:37.930
It could be a trap.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.464
Then we go together.

39:42.740 --> 39:45.379
A lair is an extension
of the killer's psychosis.
