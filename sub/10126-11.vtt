WEBVTT

00:20.133 --> 00:22.734
"TWO ROADS DIVERGED
IN A WOOD, AND I--

00:22.734 --> 00:24.834
"I TOOK THE ONE
LESS TRAVELED BY,

00:24.834 --> 00:27.100
AND THAT HAS MADE
ALL THE DIFFERENCE."

00:27.100 --> 00:29.967
OK. NOW, WHAT
DO WE TAKE FROM
THIS POEM?

00:29.967 --> 00:32.133
[SNORING]

00:32.133 --> 00:35.200
[CORY]
YIIIP-YIP-YIP-YIP-YIP.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.834
[SNORE]

00:36.834 --> 00:39.367
YIIIP-YIP-YIP-YIP-YIP.

00:39.367 --> 00:40.600
[SNORE]

00:40.600 --> 00:42.700
YIIIP-YIP-YIP-YIP-YIP.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.100
INTERESTING.
IN MY CLASS,

00:45.100 --> 00:47.100
MR. HUNTER HANDLES
THE YIPPING.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.834
SHAWN! SHAWN,
IT'S BOTH OF THEM.

00:56.700 --> 00:59.600
OH, NO. NOW I DON'T
KNOW WHICH CLASS
I SLEPT THROUGH.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.500
MINE, HUNTER. REMEMBER,
<i>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN?</i>

01:04.500 --> 01:07.000
A REMARKABLE POEM
IN WHICH THE POET
TELLS US

01:07.000 --> 01:08.600
THAT WE MAKE
CHOICES IN LIFE,

01:08.600 --> 01:11.400
AND EACH CHOICE
PUTS US ON
A NEW ROAD

01:11.400 --> 01:14.567
THAT CAN HAVE
A PROFOUND EFFECT
ON OUR DESTINIES.

01:14.567 --> 01:17.200
HOW DOES A POEM
ABOUT A GUY ON 2 ROADS

01:17.200 --> 01:18.700
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH OUR LIVES

01:18.700 --> 01:20.400
WHEN WE CAN'T
EVEN DRIVE YET?

01:23.400 --> 01:25.000
ISN'T HE FUN?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.767
I LIKE TO THINK OF HIM
AS JOB SECURITY.

01:29.834 --> 01:34.600
MR. MATTHEWS, WHAT
WAS YOUR LAST CHOICE
IN YOUR LIFE?

01:34.600 --> 01:37.567
WELL, I DID
JUST GET A JOB FOR
CHRISTMAS BREAK.

01:37.567 --> 01:40.233
I'M A GOPHER
AT LITTLE PAULEY'S
RESTAURANT.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.967
AND I GOT ME THIS
SOFT, CUSHY UNION JOB
DOWN ON THE DOCKS.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.934
THIS YEAR,
I'LL FINALLY BE ABLE
TO BUY NICE PRESENTS

01:45.934 --> 01:47.300
FOR MY FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.033
I WANT YOU ALL
TO KEEP A JOURNAL

01:49.033 --> 01:50.600
OF THE CHOICES YOU MAKE
OVER THE NEXT WEEK.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.967
THEN WRITE A PAPER

01:51.967 --> 01:54.967
ON THE POTENTIAL
OF THOSE CHOICES
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

01:54.967 --> 01:57.967
MR. TURNER, WHAT IF
MY CHOICE IS TO NOT
DO THE ASSIGNMENT?

01:57.967 --> 01:59.900
YOU WANT THIS ONE,
GEORGE?

01:59.900 --> 02:01.300
NO, NO. YOUR CLASS.

02:01.300 --> 02:03.300
I GET THEM
AFTER LUNCH.

02:03.300 --> 02:06.367
YOU WOULD GET AN "F,"
NOT GET INTO COLLEGE,

02:06.367 --> 02:08.667
SPEND YOUR TIME
HANGING OUT AT
THE CONVENIENCE STORE,

02:08.667 --> 02:11.133
WAITING FOR THEM TO
BRING IN A NEW BATCH
OF LOTTERY TICKETS.

02:11.133 --> 02:12.800
AND THAT WOULD
CHANGE MY LIFE HOW?

02:19.367 --> 02:20.600
HEY, LONNIE, UH,

02:20.600 --> 02:22.300
THIS'LL BE YOUR FIRST
CHRISTMAS IN THE CITY, HUH?

02:22.300 --> 02:24.834
OH, YEAH. I'M REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

02:24.834 --> 02:27.400
OF COURSE, IT WON'T BE
QUITE LIKE CHRISTMAS
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.734
BET IT'S NICE UP THERE.

02:28.734 --> 02:31.200
OH, YEAH. WHILE ME
AND MY BROTHERS

02:31.200 --> 02:33.500
ARE OUT BACK,
CUTTING DOWN A TREE,

02:33.500 --> 02:36.600
MAMA'S IN THE KITCHEN
COOKING A GOOSE

02:36.600 --> 02:39.600
AND BAKING PIES
AND COOKIES...

02:39.600 --> 02:45.100
AND EVERYBODY'S
ALL HAPPY AND WARM
AND LOVING EACH OTHER.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.600
I MISS THEM SO BAD,
I COULD JUST CRY.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.934
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S OK.

02:49.934 --> 02:53.233
YOU JUST USE ME AS
YOUR HANDKERCHIEF.

02:53.233 --> 02:54.467
[SNIFFS]

02:56.400 --> 02:58.000
AND SHE DID.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.934
I NEVER REALIZED
HOW MUCH I MISSED
MY FOLKS.

03:01.934 --> 03:03.767
BUT NOW I LIVE
IN THE CITY,

03:03.767 --> 03:06.400
AND THERE'S SIMPLY NO WAY
FOR ME TO BE WITH THEM
THIS CHRISTMAS.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.500
YES, THERE IS!

03:07.500 --> 03:08.567
NO, THERE ISN'T.

03:08.567 --> 03:09.867
I WILL DRIVE
YOU THERE.

03:09.867 --> 03:11.467
IT'S 500 MILES.

03:11.467 --> 03:12.400
GOOD!

03:15.700 --> 03:17.700
THANK YOU, ERIC!

03:21.900 --> 03:23.300
WHO ARE YOU?

03:23.300 --> 03:24.300
HI. I'M CORY MATTHEWS.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.500
SAM AT THE BAR
HIRED ME

03:25.500 --> 03:27.200
TO BRING PEOPLE DRINKS
AND RUN ERRANDS

03:27.200 --> 03:29.133
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO EARN EXTRA MONEY--

03:29.133 --> 03:31.200
STOP TALKING NOW.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.033
YES, SIR.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.400
WHAT'S THAT?

03:34.400 --> 03:35.700
UH, CAPPUCCINO, SIRS.

03:35.700 --> 03:39.800
SAM AT THE BAR
SAID I SHOULD
BRING YOU SOME--

03:39.800 --> 03:41.500
SAM AT THE BAR...

03:41.500 --> 03:43.567
THINKS HE KNOWS
WHAT I LIKE?

03:43.567 --> 03:45.233
I WOULD NEVER--

03:45.233 --> 03:47.600
SAM AT THE BAR
HAS A TENDENCY

03:47.600 --> 03:49.600
TO RUN OFF
AT THE MOUTH.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.967
I DON'T LIKE TENDENCIES.
I DON'T LIKE MOUTHS.

03:54.967 --> 03:57.000
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.200
I DO,
BUT I'M SCARED.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.233
WHO MADE THIS?

04:01.734 --> 04:03.033
WHO MADE THIS?

04:03.033 --> 04:06.500
ANSWER HIM,
AND CHOOSE YOUR
WORDS CAREFULLY.

04:08.467 --> 04:09.400
I...

04:11.133 --> 04:13.667
DID.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.900
HEY, IT'S FANTASTIC.
TRY IT AND TELL ME
IF I'M WRONG.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.734
I'LL TELL YOU
IF YOU'RE WRONG.

04:18.734 --> 04:20.367
I'LL TELL YOU
IF YOU'RE WRONG.

04:23.300 --> 04:26.867
YOU'RE RIGHT!
THIS IS GOOD.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.200
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
I DID TAKE THE LIBERTY

04:29.200 --> 04:30.967
OF ADDING
A DASH OF CINNAMON.

04:30.967 --> 04:32.967
THIS IS
FOR YOU, KID.

04:32.967 --> 04:34.500
WOW! $20.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.900
KEEP SLINGIN'
THEM CAPPUCCINOS,

04:35.900 --> 04:37.600
MAYBE I COME UP
WITH ANOTHER 20.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.000
THEN A-SLINGIN'
I'LL BE,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.767
AND IF YOU GENTLEMEN
NEED ANYTHING--

04:40.767 --> 04:42.834
I'D LIKE YOU
TO ACCOMPANY MY
NEW YOUNG BRIDE

04:42.834 --> 04:44.834
TO THE BEAUTY PARLOR--
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.467
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THAT, SIR.

04:46.467 --> 04:49.233
SAM AT THE BAR GAVE ME
A LIST OF THINGS TO DO.

04:49.233 --> 04:50.734
WE'LL CLEAR IT
WITH SAM.

04:50.734 --> 04:52.000
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT SAM.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.200
SAM.
SAM.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.600
SHAWN.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.400
A LITTLE BREAKFAST?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.000
LUNCH. I'M ON LUNCH.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.200
IT'S 8:30
IN THE MORNING.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.967
I'VE BEEN WORKING
IN THE DOCKS
SINCE 3 A.M.

05:05.967 --> 05:08.934
DO YOU KNOW HOW COLD
IT IS AT 3 A.M.?

05:08.934 --> 05:11.767
NIPPY?

05:11.767 --> 05:14.000
YEAH. NIPPY.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.767
DO YOU WANNA WATCH ME
BREAK MY EAR OFF?

05:16.767 --> 05:19.834
SIT, DARLING. I'LL MAKE YOU
SOME HOT CHOCOLATE.

05:19.834 --> 05:21.867
I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT
WAS EASY ON THE DOCKS.

05:21.867 --> 05:23.467
THAT'S WHAT IT SAID
IN THE BROCHURE.

05:23.467 --> 05:24.800
SO I SHOW UP
THIS MORNING,

05:24.800 --> 05:27.300
AND THE WIND-CHILL
FACTOR IS, LIKE,
JUPITER,

05:27.300 --> 05:30.734
AND I GO UP TO
THE BOSS AND SAY,
[MUMBLES],

05:30.734 --> 05:33.467
AND HE GOES,
"YEAH, BUT YOU
TOOK THE JOB."

05:33.467 --> 05:35.600
AND I GO, [MUMBLES],

05:35.600 --> 05:36.867
AND HE GOES,
"THAT'S NICE.

05:36.867 --> 05:38.400
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS
FOR YOUR FRIENDS."

05:38.400 --> 05:40.200
AND I SAID,
[MUMBLES],

05:40.200 --> 05:42.500
AND HE GOES,
"OH, LOOK.
TURKISH FREIGHTER."

05:42.500 --> 05:45.300
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IN COMES A TURKISH
FREIGHTER.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.467
UNEXPECTEDLY?

05:46.467 --> 05:47.767
OUT OF THE MIST
IT CAME.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.400
THAT'S MY WONDERFUL
JOB, CORY--

05:49.400 --> 05:51.100
3:00 IN THE MORNING,
50 BELOW,

05:51.100 --> 05:52.734
UNLOADING THE SAME
TURKISH FREIGHTER

05:52.734 --> 05:55.667
THAT BROUGHT IN
THE<i>OUTBREAK MONKEY.</i>

05:55.667 --> 05:57.734
DO YOU KNOW
SOMETHING?

05:57.734 --> 05:59.834
IF I GO, YOU GO!

05:59.834 --> 06:01.300
AAH! AAH!

06:03.000 --> 06:04.934
NOW YOU GET NO COCOA!

06:07.200 --> 06:09.767
SO, HOW'S YOUR JOB?

06:09.767 --> 06:12.734
WELL, IT'S TOUGH.
IT'S VERY TOUGH, SHAWN.

06:12.734 --> 06:14.000
IT'S BRUTAL.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.967
YOU GOT A CUSHY JOB.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.767
YES!

06:17.767 --> 06:21.500
YO, COFFEE BOY,

06:21.500 --> 06:24.734
WATCH ME MAKE 20 BUCKS.

06:24.734 --> 06:26.900

06:33.700 --> 06:35.600
OH, YES, OF COURSE.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.400
THERE'S THE OTHER PART
WHERE I DO SOMETHING.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.767
YOU TAKE
THIS ENVELOPE.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.834
YOU GO TO
THE MAILBOX ON
14th AND PINE--

06:43.834 --> 06:46.133
AND MAKE SURE
NO ONE SEES YOU.

06:46.133 --> 06:48.400
NOBODY. PUT

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
OK, OK. NOW,
YOU BOTH KNOW

06:50.400 --> 06:52.734
HOW I'M NOT ONE

06:52.734 --> 06:56.467
BUT, UH...

AT 14th AND PINE.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.600
TODAY THERE'S
GONNA BE A MAILBOX

07:06.600 --> 07:10.033
AND MR. FOUNTAIN
IS NEVER WRONG ABOUT
MAILBOX PLACEMENT.

07:10.033 --> 07:12.233
OH...OK.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.800
UM, ONCE AGAIN,
IF I MAY,

07:15.800 --> 07:17.767
IF YOU REALLY
WANT THIS MAILED,

07:17.767 --> 07:20.734
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
PUTTING A STAMP ON HERE,

07:20.734 --> 07:22.500
AND MAYBE EVEN
AN ADDRESS.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.700
YOU'RE A NOTICER,
AREN'T YOU?

07:25.700 --> 07:28.033
I NOTICED THAT
YOU'RE A NOTICER.

07:28.033 --> 07:30.867
NOT TO WORRY.
THIS ENVELOPE IS
DEFINITELY GETTING

07:30.867 --> 07:32.667

RIGHT, SIR?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.100

07:45.233 --> 07:46.734
NOTHING. NOTHING.
NOT A THING.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.100
YOU'RE WORKING

08:08.000 --> 08:10.734
I HAVE TO QUIT.
I CAN'T WORK FOR
THE MOB.

08:10.734 --> 08:13.400
LITTLE MORE
CAPPUCCINO HERE.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.700
EVERY TIME I TRY

08:21.000 --> 08:22.500
I QUIT.
OK.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.967
YOU CAN'T KEEP
ME HERE.

08:23.967 --> 08:24.967
WE'LL MISS YOU.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.867
I--I DON'T LIKE
TO BE THREATENED.

08:26.867 --> 08:29.900
YOU MADE A FINE
CUP OF CAPPUCCINO.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.767
LOOK, ABOUT MY FRIEND.

08:40.767 --> 08:43.700
I KNOW SOMETIMES
HE SEEMS A LITTLE CHATTY,

08:43.700 --> 08:46.133
BUT TRUST ME,
HE'S A SMART KID.

08:46.133 --> 08:47.800
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.200
LOYALTY. YOU'RE
LOYAL TO A BUDDY.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.233
I LIKE LOYALTY
IN A PERSON.

08:52.233 --> 08:54.367
I LIKE IT

08:55.400 --> 08:57.200
HEY, LOU,

09:00.066 --> 09:02.467
HEY,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.367
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT

09:13.367 --> 09:14.734
HAZELNUT BISCOTTI,

PERFECTLY.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.800
HEY, LOU, DID
I TELL YOU THIS

09:22.800 --> 09:23.867
WAS I RIGHT?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.867
SO, SHAWN,

09:25.867 --> 09:28.600
WE GOT A NICE

09:28.600 --> 09:30.033
BUT WE MAKE

09:30.033 --> 09:33.100
I FIGURE YOU DO

GOOD TAKE-OUT
BUSINESS?

09:34.467 --> 09:35.967

09:49.500 --> 09:51.500
NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU SHOULD BE AT SCHOOL.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.700
COME ON, MAN. JOBS
LIKE THIS DON'T COME
AROUND VERY OFTEN.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.000
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU WORKED HERE.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.500
YEAH, BUT I QUIT
WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT THINGS...

09:58.500 --> 10:02.133
WEREN'T, YOU KNOW,
AS THE F.B.I.
WOULD PREFER.

10:02.133 --> 10:04.400
THIS IS JUST A NICE,
FAMILY RESTAURANT IN
A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.100
NOTHING'S GOING ON.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.767
[LOUD BANG]

10:07.767 --> 10:10.834
[CAR MOTOR STUTTERS,
MISFIRES]

10:10.834 --> 10:12.000
THAT WAS A CAR
BACKFIRING.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.600
YEAH. LOOKS
LIKE IT WAS.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.600
THEN WHY ARE WE
ON THE GROUND?

10:17.467 --> 10:18.667
'CAUSE IT'S FUN,

10:18.667 --> 10:20.233
AND WE DO
EVERYTHING
TOGETHER.

10:23.467 --> 10:26.767
LOOK, SHAWN, WE BOTH
KNOW A JOB LIKE THIS

10:26.767 --> 10:28.400
CANNOT LEAD
TO ANYTHING GOOD.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.000
IT DOESN'T LEAD
ANYWHERE, OK?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.300
IT'S JUST A JOB
FOR A COUPLE DAYS

10:31.300 --> 10:33.600
SO I CAN BUY
DECENT PRESENTS
FOR MY FRIENDS.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.867
I JUST WORRY IT'S
GONNA CHANGE YOU.

10:35.867 --> 10:37.100
IT'S NOT GONNA
CHANGE ME.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.200
<i>SCUSI, SHAWN!</i>

10:38.200 --> 10:39.400

<i>PER FAVORE!</i>

10:39.400 --> 10:41.667
<i>IO PARLO CON</i>
<i>IL MIO AMICO!</i>

10:42.800 --> 10:44.300
WHAT?

10:44.300 --> 10:46.467
WHAT?

10:46.467 --> 10:48.800
NEVER THOUGHT
THIS CHRISTMAS
I'D BE DRIVING

10:48.800 --> 10:50.100
500 MILES
WITH SOMEONE

10:50.100 --> 10:52.700
WHO MAKES THE WHOLE
TURNPIKE EXPERIENCE
SEEM SO

10:52.700 --> 10:55.767
ALLURING
AND VOLUPTUOUS.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.767
ERIC, I DON'T WANT
TO ALARM YOU,

10:57.767 --> 10:59.734
BUT I'M GETTING
THIS POWERFUL FEELING.

10:59.734 --> 11:03.400
REALLY? WELL,
WE ARE IN PRETTY
CLOSE QUARTERS,

11:03.400 --> 11:05.867
AND THAT COZY
HOLIDAY SPIRIT'S
IN THE AIR,

11:05.867 --> 11:08.867
AND YOU ARE GETTING
THE FULL IMPACT OF
MY RIGHT PROFILE.

11:08.867 --> 11:10.200
WE SHOULD STOP THE CAR.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.400
OH, GOODY.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.133
LOOK, ERIC,

11:15.133 --> 11:16.800
YOU MAY BE LESS
EXPERIENCED ABOUT THIS,

11:16.800 --> 11:19.400
SO WHATEVER I SAY
YOU GOTTA DO IT
WITHOUT QUESTION.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.567
GOOD.

11:20.567 --> 11:22.500
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
ABOUT THIS.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.033
YOU DREAMED ABOUT
THE BLIZZARD?

11:24.033 --> 11:25.033
WHA?

11:25.033 --> 11:26.734
ERIC, THE FEELING
I'VE BEEN HAVING

11:26.734 --> 11:29.767
IS THAT THERE IS
A VERY BIG
AND POWERFUL BLIZZARD

11:29.767 --> 11:31.100
HEADED OUR WAY RIGHT NOW.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.200
OH, NO, NO, NO.
A BLIZZARD?

11:33.200 --> 11:36.767
JUST A FEW FLAKES
IN A ROMANTIC
SNOWFLAKE SETTING.

11:36.767 --> 11:39.233
WE'RE TRAPPED
IN AN ICY TOMB
OF FROZEN DEATH!

11:39.233 --> 11:41.400
IT'S JUST 4 OR 5 FEET
OF DENSE PACK.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.033
DON'T PANIC.

11:43.033 --> 11:44.100
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.233
I WORK IN
A WILDERNESS STORE.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.300
I SELL SURVIVAL
EQUIPMENT.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.834
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.200
MARK EVERYTHING
UP 30%!

11:49.200 --> 11:51.000
HOW AM I DOING?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.867
YOU'RE FOGGING UP
THE WINDOWS.

11:52.867 --> 11:54.133
NOW JUST CALM YOURSELF.

11:54.133 --> 11:55.567
AND PROTECT YOU.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.400
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO PROTECT YOU,

11:57.400 --> 11:58.934
AND PROTECT YOU,
I WILL.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.700
I'VE HURT MY HEAD.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.734
HO HO HO,
MY BEST FRIEND.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.100
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

12:14.100 --> 12:15.567
CHRISTMAS EVE'S
NOT TILL TOMORROW NIGHT.

12:15.567 --> 12:16.900
I KNOW THAT, BUT
I JUST BOUGHT YOU

12:16.900 --> 12:18.567
THE BEST PRESENT
I EVER ACTUALLY
PAID FOR,

12:18.567 --> 12:20.300
AND I WANTED TO SEE
YOUR FACE LIGHT UP

12:20.300 --> 12:21.500
LIKE A HAPPY
LITTLE ELF.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.400
SO, LIGHT UP.
LIGHT UP,
LITTLE ELF.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.600
IT'S A WATCH.

12:29.033 --> 12:32.500
A VERY EXPENSIVE WATCH.

12:35.867 --> 12:38.500
WHICH I CAN'T ACCEPT.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.600
WHY NOT?

12:40.600 --> 12:44.967
BECAUSE OF WHERE
THE MONEY COMES FROM.

12:44.967 --> 12:48.734
I HAD IT ENGRAVED
WITH YOUR NAME.

12:48.734 --> 12:51.967
"TO MY BEST FRIEND CORY."

12:51.967 --> 12:52.967
SHAWN, THANKS.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.834
HEY, LISTEN, NOW
THAT YOU FINALLY BOUGHT

12:56.834 --> 12:58.200
YOUR FRIEND A NICE GIFT,

12:58.200 --> 12:59.667
YOU CAN QUIT
YOUR JOB, RIGHT?

12:59.667 --> 13:02.300
CORY, IT'S
EASY MONEY.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.700
HOW CAN I QUIT
EASY MONEY?

13:04.700 --> 13:08.000
LISTEN, I MADE $160
WORKING THERE.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.934
YOU CAN HAVE THAT.

13:09.934 --> 13:11.367
THAT'S EVEN EASIER MONEY.

13:11.367 --> 13:12.667
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS QUIT.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.500
NO, NO. SPEND IT
ON TOPANGA
AND YOUR FAMILY.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.000
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.767
SHAWN, WAIT.

13:20.767 --> 13:21.767
YOU'RE STILL
GONNA BE HERE

13:21.767 --> 13:23.133

CHRISTMAS EVE, RIGHT?

13:23.133 --> 13:24.767
YEAH. HEY,
DON'T WORRY,
DON'T WORRY.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.400
THAT'S A TRADITION
I'D NEVER MISS.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.834
HEY.

13:27.834 --> 13:28.967
YEAH?

13:28.967 --> 13:31.033
THANKS FOR THE WATCH.

13:31.033 --> 13:32.900
I APPRECIATE IT.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.567
NOT BECAUSE OF
WHAT IT COSTS,

13:34.567 --> 13:37.000
BUT BECAUSE OF
WHO IT'S FROM.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.967
YOU'RE WELCOME.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.400
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

13:53.567 --> 13:54.967
HE'S OK.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.867
HE'S JUST GOT
A LITTLE KNOCK
ON THE HEAD.

13:56.867 --> 13:58.600
HEY, MOMMY. HEY, DADDY.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.100
OH, NO. MORE HORSEY.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.500
MORE HORSEY.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.934
ERIC, HONEY,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:05.934 --> 14:07.600
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
WERE ON YOUR WAY UP

14:07.600 --> 14:08.667
TO LONNIE'S
FOLKS' HOUSE.

14:08.667 --> 14:09.734
NEVER MADE IT.

14:09.734 --> 14:11.300
RAN INTO A NASTY SQUALL,
4 FEET OF SNOW.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.767
WE HAD TO STAY
IN THE CAR UNTIL
THE PLOW DUG US OUT.

14:13.767 --> 14:14.767
IT WAS NO BIG THING.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.300
HOW DID HE BUMP
HIS HEAD?

14:16.300 --> 14:17.800
LIKE THIS: AAH-PAH!

14:20.400 --> 14:21.867
WELL, YOU TWO
MUST BE STARVED.

14:21.867 --> 14:23.200
I'LL GO WARM YOU UP
SOME SOUP.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.600
I'LL GET YOU
SOME BLANKETS.

14:30.033 --> 14:32.500
SO, LONNIE,

14:32.500 --> 14:33.800
HOW'D I SAVE US?

14:33.800 --> 14:35.934
ERIC, I DIDN'T WANNA
SCARE YOUR FOLKS,

14:35.934 --> 14:38.200
BUT WE BOTH NEARLY
DIED BACK THERE.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.500
DIED?

14:39.500 --> 14:40.600
WHEN THE SNOW FELL

14:40.600 --> 14:42.400
AND THE TEMPERATURE
DROPPED BELOW FREEZING,

14:42.400 --> 14:43.900
I WRAPPED MY ARMS
AROUND YOU

14:43.900 --> 14:45.400
AND HELD YOU
AS TIGHT AS I COULD.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.834
NO, YOU NEVER DID THAT.
I WOULD'VE REMEMBERED THAT.

14:47.834 --> 14:49.100
YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.200
YOU WERE HOLDING ME

14:50.200 --> 14:51.734
AND I WAS UNCONSCIOUS?

14:51.734 --> 14:53.400
MM-HMM.
YOU WERE SHAKING
AND SHIVERING

14:53.400 --> 14:54.800
AND TURNING
ALL BLUE,

14:54.800 --> 14:57.367
SO THERE WAS ONLY
ONE THING LEFT
TO DO TO SURVIVE.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.834
YOU ATE MY LEG?

14:59.834 --> 15:01.300
NO, ERIC.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.233
I HAD TO WARM UP
YOUR BODY,

15:03.233 --> 15:05.500
SO I REMEMBERED
THE OLD TRAPPER'S
TRICK.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.600
I STRIPPED YOUR
CLOTHES OFF OF YOU,

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
AND I STRIPPED
MINE OFF OF ME,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.000
AND I WRAPPED US
BOTH UP

15:11.000 --> 15:12.800
IN A TINY TIGHT
SLEEPING BAG
ALL NAKED.

15:16.900 --> 15:20.200
BUT, ERIC,
WE SURVIVED.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.300
SO WHAT?

15:22.300 --> 15:24.500
LONNIE, WHEN YOU'RE
SURVIVING WITH SOMEONE
LIKE THAT,

15:24.500 --> 15:27.667
YOU HAVE THE COMMON COURTESY
TO WAKE THEM UP.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.133
YOU KICK 'EM, SMACK 'EM,

15:29.133 --> 15:31.700
YELL IN THEIR EAR,
"HEY, WE'RE NAKED!"

15:32.967 --> 15:34.033
HERE YOU GO,

15:34.033 --> 15:37.500
HOT BOWL OF SOUP
TO WARM YOU UP.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.967
OH, GREAT,
I'M AWAKE FOR THE SOUP.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.567
MR. FOUNTAIN,
MR. MARTINI,

15:45.567 --> 15:47.000
THE, UH, PLACE
IS ALL CLEANED UP,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.200
SO IF THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE,

15:48.200 --> 15:49.867
I GOT A LITTLE
CHRISTMAS EVE THING
WITH MY BUDDY.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.100
ACTUALLY,
THERE'S ONE MORE
LITTLE FAVOR

15:52.100 --> 15:53.300
I NEED TONIGHT.

15:53.300 --> 15:57.133
OOH, TONIGHT'S REAL TOUGH
FOR ME, MR. FOUNTAIN.

15:57.133 --> 15:58.233
UH...

16:00.967 --> 16:02.367
$200.

16:02.367 --> 16:04.500
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS BOX,

16:04.500 --> 16:05.600
GO DOWN THE STREET,

16:05.600 --> 16:07.667
STAND IN FRONT
OF THE WAREHOUSE,

16:08.100 --> 16:10.500
CAR WILL COME BY,
A GUY WILL ASK FOR IT,

16:10.500 --> 16:11.400
YOU WILL GIVE IT
TO HIM.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.600
HE WILL GIVE YOU
AN ENVELOPE.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.100
YOU BRING IT
BACK HERE.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.100
NOW YOU DO THAT
FOR US, KID,

16:18.100 --> 16:19.867
AND MAYBE WE FIND SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE PERMANENT.

16:19.867 --> 16:20.934
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:37.667 --> 16:39.567
COME ON, LET'S GO.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.100
YOU'RE WORKING
MUCH TOO HARD.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.667
NOW, WE'RE HAVING
CHRISTMAS EVE OVER
AT MY HOUSE.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.734
NOTHING YOU'RE
DOING HERE COULD BE
NEARLY AS IMPORTANT,

16:45.734 --> 16:48.000
SO COME ON. LET'S GO.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.367
I GOT PAID FOR A JOB,

16:49.367 --> 16:50.867
AND I'M GONNA DO IT.

16:50.867 --> 16:53.900
OOH, LOYALTY.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.467
I LIKE THAT

16:55.467 --> 16:58.667
IN A WORTHLESS
LITTLE COFFEE BOY

16:58.667 --> 17:01.900
WHO THEY DON'T CARE
IF HE LIVES OR DIES.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.867
I'VE NEVER HAD MONEY
LIKE THAT BEFORE, CORY.

17:03.867 --> 17:05.300
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE SOMEBODY

17:05.300 --> 17:06.500
TO BE ABLE TO BUY
NICE PRESENTS

17:06.500 --> 17:08.000
FOR MY FAMILY
AND FRIENDS.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.233
YEAH, I'M SURE
THAT'S A REAL NICE
FEELING.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.500
HEY,
WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

17:18.500 --> 17:19.834
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S IN THE BOX.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.500
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS BOX.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.100
I AM MERELY
THE BOX HOLDER.

17:23.100 --> 17:24.200
NO, COME ON,
OPEN IT UP.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.233
I WANNA SEE
WHAT'S INSIDE.

17:25.233 --> 17:26.700
I WANNA SEE YOUR
FACE LIGHT UP

17:26.700 --> 17:28.033
LIKE A HAPPY
LITTLE ELF.

17:28.033 --> 17:29.934
OPEN IT UP,
MY LITTLE ELF.

17:29.934 --> 17:31.867
CORY, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANNA
SPEND MY LIFE

17:31.867 --> 17:33.467
IN FRONT OF
A CONVENIENCE STORE

17:33.467 --> 17:37.400
WAITING AROUND
FOR THE NEXT BATCH
OF LOTTERY TICKETS.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.500
SHAWN, HE WAS
EXAGGERATING.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.033
YEAH, WELL, IT RANG
PRETTY TRUE TO ME.

17:42.033 --> 17:43.567
SO THIS IS IT.

17:43.567 --> 17:45.500
THIS IS THE ROAD
YOU'RE TAKING.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.934
THIS ISN'T A ROAD,
THIS IS A BOX.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.834
AND AS LONG AS
I DON'T OPEN
THIS BOX,

17:49.834 --> 17:51.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S IN IT.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.467
THERE'S A TEDDY BEAR
IN THIS BOX.

17:52.467 --> 17:53.667
OH, A TEDDY?

17:53.667 --> 17:55.767
OK, OK, SO COME OVER
TO MY HOUSE,

17:55.767 --> 17:57.700
WE'LL PUT THE TEDDY
UNDER THE TREE,

17:57.700 --> 17:59.700
AND AT THE END OF THE NIGHT
WE'LL PLAY A LITTLE GAME

17:59.700 --> 18:02.500
CALLED "LET'S GUESS
THE STREET VALUE OF
THE TEDDY."

18:11.867 --> 18:14.767
HOW'D THIS GET
SO COMPLICATED
SO FAST?

18:14.767 --> 18:15.934
I DON'T KNOW.

18:15.934 --> 18:17.767
I GUESS THAT'S HOW
THEY GET YOU.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.600
THEY FIND A GUY
WHO FEELS LIKE HE'S
NOWHERE IN HIS LIFE,

18:20.600 --> 18:23.967
AND THEY MAKE HIM BELIEVE
THAT WHERE HE SHOULD BE

18:23.967 --> 18:26.300
IS ON A STREET CORNER
HOLDING A BOX

18:26.300 --> 18:28.233
IN THE MIDDLE OF
CHRISTMAS EVE.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.300
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
THIS IS MY STREET.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.900
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

18:32.900 --> 18:35.400
THIS IS WHERE I END UP
LIKE THAT POEM SAYS.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.033
NO. NO, SEE,
THE POEM SAYS

18:37.033 --> 18:38.700
YOU HAVE CHOICES
IN YOUR LIFE.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.867
AND EVERY CHOICE YOU MAKE
MEANS SOMETHING.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.867
I MEAN, SHAWN,
WE'RE ONLY 16 YEARS OLD,

18:42.867 --> 18:44.734
AND WE GOT FOOLED
BY A COUPLE OF GUYS

18:44.734 --> 18:46.233
WHO LOOK LIKE
OUR UNCLES.

18:46.233 --> 18:47.700
DO YOU SEE
HOW EASY IT IS

18:47.700 --> 18:49.400
TO END UP ON
THE WRONG ROAD?

18:49.400 --> 18:52.867
YEAH, AND I KNEW
ALL ABOUT THEM, TOO.

18:52.867 --> 18:54.133
I DIDN'T WALK AWAY.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.100
YOU SEE, I FIGURED
I'D JUST GET THEM
SOME COFFEE,

18:57.100 --> 18:59.934
MAKE SOME MONEY,
AND--AND...

19:00.200 --> 19:03.100
GET OUT BEFORE
IT GOT TO THIS.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.567
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

19:04.567 --> 19:06.200
I--I DON'T KNOW.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.767
I GUESS I THOUGHT
I WAS ONE OF THOSE
STREET-SMART GUYS.

19:08.767 --> 19:12.200
BUT NOW, I'M
A LITTLE SCARED.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.934
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
I DIDN'T SEE THIS
COMING AT ALL.

19:14.934 --> 19:16.934
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
THE DEVIL WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE

19:16.934 --> 19:20.300
SOME GUY WITH HORNS
AND A BIG TAIL.

19:22.667 --> 19:23.500
CORY, IT'S
CHRISTMAS EVE.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
YOU SHOULD BE
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.000
NO.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.400
NO, SEE, THAT WOULD BE
THE WRONG CHOICE.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.567
SEE, THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE POEM

19:31.567 --> 19:35.600
IS THAT THAT GUY
HAD TO CHOOSE
HIS ROAD ALONE.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.400
SO YOU DON'T THINK
HE HAD A BEST FRIEND?

19:37.400 --> 19:39.700
NO, I GUESS NOT.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.667
BUT ACCORDING TO THIS...

19:45.667 --> 19:46.600
YOU DO.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.734
"TWO ROADS DIVERGE
IN A WOOD..."

19:59.934 --> 20:00.834
AND I CHOOSE THE ONE

20:00.834 --> 20:02.600
THAT LEADS BACK
TO YOUR HOUSE.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.400
GOOD.

20:06.934 --> 20:10.233
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE THIS BACK FIRST.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.100
WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY

20:12.100 --> 20:14.000
IF THERE REALLY WAS
A TEDDY BEAR IN THERE?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.500
YEAH.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.233
DON'T YOU WISH LIFE
WAS LIKE THAT?

20:18.233 --> 20:21.100
I'M BEGINNING
TO SEE...

20:21.100 --> 20:22.834
THAT IT'S NOT.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.967
OHH.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.200
THIS IS EXACTLY
THE SHIRT I SAW
IN THAT WINDOW

20:40.200 --> 20:42.600
AND TOLD YOU I WANTED
AND MADE YOU BUY IT,

20:42.600 --> 20:44.133
AND NOW I HAVE IT.

20:44.133 --> 20:45.200
YEAH.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.000
YOU--YOU LIKE IT?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.100
I LOVE IT.

20:48.100 --> 20:51.600
BUT I DO KIND OF MISS
THE SURPRISE ELEMENT.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.500
HEY, LONNIE,
THERE'S A BLIZZARD.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.300
UH-OH. BRR.

20:58.367 --> 21:00.200
NOW I'M UNCONSCIOUS.
SAVE ME.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.600
ERIC, IT NEVER
HAPPENED.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.867
I MADE THE WHOLE
THING UP.

21:03.867 --> 21:04.467
YOU DID?

21:04.467 --> 21:06.233
YUP, SORRY.

21:06.233 --> 21:07.500
CUTE BUTT, THOUGH.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.900
OK, FOLKS, EVERYBODY
GET TOGETHER NOW.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.100
REAL CLOSE.

21:13.100 --> 21:16.300
LOOK RIGHT HERE
INTO THE CAMERA.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.834
OK, I HAVE SET IT.

21:19.800 --> 21:20.800
EVERYBODY SMILE.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.200
SMILE.
