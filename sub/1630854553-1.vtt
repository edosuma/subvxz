03:27.163 --> 03:31.080
[leader] Ho, ho,
fucking ho.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.082
Santa wants
to know who'’s in charge

03:33.125 --> 03:36.085
of these outrageous
overdraft fees.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.435
Put the money in the bag.

03:38.479 --> 03:43.571
My friends, this bank is
an institution of corruption.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.312
What a good little girl.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.314
Santa won'’t forget you.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.620
This is what you worship,
your money.

03:49.664 --> 03:52.275
This place only cares
about your money!

03:52.319 --> 03:53.450
You wanna hurt them?

03:53.494 --> 03:55.452
This is how you hurt them.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.280
You take what'’s precious
to them.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.196
Christmas is coming.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.286
So, I wanna say,
"Merry Christmas, sheep,"

04:03.330 --> 04:05.375
because you will unwrap
a present

04:05.419 --> 04:07.682
which is the great liberation!

04:07.725 --> 04:09.945
And it will destroy
this civilization

04:09.988 --> 04:13.818
just like an earthquake
from the Book of Revelations!

04:13.862 --> 04:15.255

04:22.653 --> 04:24.002
Hurry the fuck up!

04:25.569 --> 04:28.006
[leader] You remind me
of my mother.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.618
I liked my mother...[bank robber] Go!

04:30.661 --> 04:35.623
...but I never forgave her
for bringing me in
to this horrible world.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.584
Because you have been
such good boys and girls,

04:40.628 --> 04:42.673
you can unwrap one gift early.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.893

[leader] You so-called
men of law enforcement

05:25.281 --> 05:28.719
have imprisoned the people of
this country for far too long.

It'’s time you learn
the true meaning of Christmas.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.784

Kill them all.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.942
[police chief sighs]

06:25.210 --> 06:28.257
Our main priority
is IDing suspects.

06:30.259 --> 06:33.393
We'’ll give the FBI
and the mayor'’s office
our full cooperation.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.178
Understood?

06:42.271 --> 06:44.055
Damn, we got hit today.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.450
And we lost.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.714
But as long as we are standing

06:50.758 --> 06:52.803
and-- and we remember
what we'’re standing for,

06:52.847 --> 06:54.544
we will always win.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.330
[sighs]

06:58.374 --> 07:01.682
They come at you with a knife,
you come at them with a gun.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.901
They come at you with a gun,
I will--

07:03.945 --> 07:06.034
Swear to God I will get you
a fucking tank.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.602
[sighs]

07:08.645 --> 07:11.256
I wanna see whoever did
this shit stand trial.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.172
Are we clear?

As many arrests
as you had citations.

Mr. Knight, you are a guest

You wanna know what tough is?

12:26.223 --> 12:27.268
Change.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.141
Because change takes sacrifice.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.579
Yeah.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.494
You have to be free
in here first

12:36.538 --> 12:37.931
before you can be free
out there.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.934
Yeah, says the guy
peddling religion.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.153
[chuckles] I may be
a religious man,

12:43.197 --> 12:44.851
but I'’m not selling religion.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.244
I'’m selling freedom.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.381
Brother Rhodes,

12:54.861 --> 12:56.079
what are you willing to do

12:56.123 --> 12:57.994
to see your family
and be free again?

13:03.347 --> 13:04.479
Anything.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.222
I'’d do anything.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.634
You'’re a fucking drug addict,

brother.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.405
[sighs]

14:03.016 --> 14:04.321
I'’ve been right where you are.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.325
They tossed me in jail
and threw away the key.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.287
All that pain.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.378
All that rage.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.251
Don'’t you waste it.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.430
Let it purify you, brother.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.957
Let it become your guiding star.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.135
Think about your family.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.398
Think about all the good
you can do for them.

14:38.703 --> 14:43.360
And I promise you'’ll
rise again like a phoenix.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.146
Greater than you'’ve ever been.

14:47.712 --> 14:50.541
I believe in you, Casey Rhodes.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.125
Do you believe in yourself?

16:25.636 --> 16:28.074
[leader] This is a liberation.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.815
Get on the ground!

16:30.859 --> 16:34.036
Get on the ground and pray
to your favorite god.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.735
You'’re gonna all be famous.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.868
This is my present to you.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.957
Merry fucking Christmas.

16:42.001 --> 16:46.614
The great liberation is at hand,
and you are a part of it.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.094
We'’re going--

16:48.137 --> 16:49.921
[customers scream, gasp]

16:51.793 --> 16:53.751
Get them up.
Get them in the vault.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.711
Someone blast a hole
in those security cameras.

17:00.715 --> 17:01.759
Get them in there.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.328
[groaning]

17:08.549 --> 17:10.159
But I'’m not selling religion.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.813
I'’m selling freedom.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.122
[groaning]

17:16.165 --> 17:17.949
Stand up, Jaden.
Come on. Get up.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.039
[Jaden] Thanks, guys.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.826
Brother, med, please.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.264
My vision is clear...

17:30.440 --> 17:32.747
[bank robber] Get in there.
Move! Move!

17:32.790 --> 17:34.096
Get into the vault.

17:37.317 --> 17:40.450
...because of your heroism
and your loyalty, brother.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.151
But I'’ve got no room
for dead weight.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.328
What-- What happened
to no man left behind?

17:50.547 --> 17:52.506
They left us all behind.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.751
[hostages screaming]

18:25.365 --> 18:27.106
[muffled screaming]

18:28.019 --> 18:29.282
[explosion]

18:29.325 --> 18:30.805
[priest] I need more men.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.722
[police radio chatter]

18:41.163 --> 18:43.296
[siren wailing in distance][nurse over PA] Dr. Kravitz,

18:43.339 --> 18:45.385
you have a visitor
in the main hall.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.344
[Fitzgerald sighs]

18:48.388 --> 18:50.303
[phone vibrating]

18:56.135 --> 18:58.746
[clears throat] What,
you in the Christmas spirit?

18:58.789 --> 19:01.618
You'’re gonna drop the charges
on my partner?

19:01.662 --> 19:03.185
'’Tis the season.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.448
He did the right thing, Cap.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.929
Look,
I try and write him letters.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.236
I try and call him.
He won'’t speak to me.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.020
He won'’t let me tell him that--

19:14.109 --> 19:17.852
He did what every partner
should do and had my back.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.723
He ignored due process.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.770
He desecrated
the oath he took.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.164
Yeah, Knight would call that
a good day'’s work.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.994
You following
the Christmas bomber?

19:30.038 --> 19:33.259
What, you'’re gonna pin
all that shit on him too?

19:33.302 --> 19:34.825
I'’m out of cards to play.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.785
FBI, CIA...

19:37.828 --> 19:39.352
[sighs]

19:39.395 --> 19:40.875
...nobody has any leads.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.356
We ran a gait analysis,

19:43.399 --> 19:46.010
ran every shell fired
through IBIS.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.274
Nothing.
This guy'’s a ghost.

19:48.317 --> 19:51.233
But Knight has done more
with less.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.974
You and I both know

19:53.017 --> 19:54.584
Knight would say yes
to joining the hunt. No, no, no.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.891
Knight has dedicated his life
to this job.

19:56.934 --> 20:00.721
He lost his wife,
his relationship with his kid,

20:00.764 --> 20:02.113
and his freedom.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.159
And if he catches the bomber,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.509
maybe he gets
one of those three back.

20:06.553 --> 20:10.948
Don'’t turn him into a monster
just to catch a monster.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.822
I got a city too scared
to leave their houses.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.217
I got a madman blowing up banks
on Christmas.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.001
And I got a mayor that--

20:20.044 --> 20:21.742
[sighs] Never mind.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.874
No, no, no.
Finish that sentence.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.876
What-- What about the mayor?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.487
Forget what I said
about the mayor.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.229
And don'’t you even think
about coming to New York.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.644
Padre... [chuckles]
...what brings you down here?

20:54.688 --> 20:57.778
Hi, Warden.
How'’s your night going?Terrible.

20:57.821 --> 21:00.302
Seems like it'’s a damn sight
better than yours?

21:00.346 --> 21:04.175
[chuckles]
You'’re very intuitive.
Yeah.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.177
I don'’t know
what I'’m doing out here
this time of night.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.701
I know it'’s a mistake.

21:08.615 --> 21:09.659
[sighs]

21:10.704 --> 21:11.922
I had a dream.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.534
Yeah, about the guys.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.840
About some of the men
in prison. I was--

21:16.884 --> 21:19.408
I just wanna check on them,
make sure they'’re okay.

21:19.452 --> 21:22.890
You had a dream?
Like a-- Like a premonition?

21:22.933 --> 21:25.893
Like a-- Like a vision.

21:25.936 --> 21:29.331
So, what prisoner
are we dreaming about?

21:30.811 --> 21:31.942
All of '’em.

21:32.987 --> 21:35.119
All of them?Yeah.

21:35.163 --> 21:37.470
Yeah,
I know this was a mistake. I--

21:37.513 --> 21:40.211
If they see me out here,
they'’re gonna think
something'’s amiss.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.431
That'’s gonna create
all kinds of drama.
I didn'’t want that.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.564
I think you'’re right there.
I think you'’re right.

21:44.607 --> 21:47.306
Yeah. No.Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.656
The security center.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.527
[chuckles]I could look
through the monitors.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.660
They wouldn'’t see me.
It would set my mind at ease.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.139
I would feel so much better.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.227
No.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.319
Yeah, yeah. You'’re right.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.019
[warden] Padre.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.326
Yeah?Come on. It'’s Christmas.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.198
Let'’s take a look, shall we?

22:10.241 --> 22:11.939
Okay. [chuckles]

22:11.982 --> 22:14.376
Yeah.
Let'’s take a look.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.683
You'’re a good man.I know.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.477
All present
and accounted for.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.392
Of course they are.

22:30.436 --> 22:35.179
I run a tighter ship
than Lord Nelson ever did.
[chuckles]

22:35.223 --> 22:38.705
Now, Father Conlan,
what was your vision?

22:39.662 --> 22:41.447
Oh,

22:41.490 --> 22:44.319
I envisioned your death.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.886
[gunshot][grunts]

22:57.811 --> 22:59.726
[PA squeaks]

22:59.769 --> 23:01.684
[Conlan on PA]
Can I have your attention,
my brothers?

23:02.729 --> 23:04.861
I bring you
great Christmas tidings.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.389
[gate buzzes]

23:14.044 --> 23:15.698
[prisoners cheering]

23:15.742 --> 23:19.746
[Conlan on PA] Today is
the beginning of the liberation.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.271
So prepare yourselves.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.318
Hmm. [chuckles]

23:29.059 --> 23:31.105
[groans]

23:31.148 --> 23:32.280
Let it begin.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.589
[prisoners chattering]

24:00.221 --> 24:02.266
[prisoners chattering, shouting]

24:26.073 --> 24:28.423
[prisoner grunting]

24:28.467 --> 24:30.860
[Conlan] Where are you,
Brother Rhodes?

24:30.904 --> 24:33.167
[grunting]

24:35.822 --> 24:37.171
Hey, man.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.955
[both grunt]

24:38.999 --> 24:40.391
[grunts]You all right?

24:40.435 --> 24:42.959
Yeah, yeah. [grunting]
Yeah.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.925
[all grunting]

25:01.848 --> 25:04.415
And unto you,
this day was born a savior.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.855
And the wages of sin is death.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.901
And freedom is a gift.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.295
You have incarcerated
your brothers

25:14.338 --> 25:18.255
which is not abided by--
by any other species.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.476
So today,

25:21.520 --> 25:24.479
I give the gift of freedom
to my brothers.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.916
Because freedom is
their birthright.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.876
Freedom is what we will take.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.532
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers!

25:33.575 --> 25:36.186
[prisoners chanting] Ho! Ho! Ho!

25:47.197 --> 25:49.635
[chanting continues]

25:52.202 --> 25:53.508
[chanting stops]

25:53.552 --> 25:55.771
[reporter]
Five guards are confirmed dead

25:55.815 --> 26:00.341
and 42 convicts escaped
from New York'’s Rikers
maximum security prison tonight.

26:00.384 --> 26:03.605
The police have released
a description of
one of the suspects.

26:03.649 --> 26:07.827
Ricky Conlan, a former marine
turned prison chaplain,

26:07.870 --> 26:10.090
who is also now being
sought for questioning

26:10.133 --> 26:12.875
regarding the Christmas
bombing attacks
on the city'’s banks.

26:12.919 --> 26:15.443
US marshals
have been dispatched...

26:15.486 --> 26:16.705
You can leave.

26:25.627 --> 26:28.369
I thought you'’d split
with the rest of '’em. [sighs]

26:28.412 --> 26:32.503
A good bed is, uh--
is hard to find.

26:32.547 --> 26:35.289
I need your read on a suspect.

26:35.332 --> 26:39.685
Tell me what every cop
and profiler from Quantico
to Camp Perry isn'’t seeing.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.211
His real name is
Richard Ricky Conlan.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.517
Conlan was Special Ops.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.607
Then he went rogue.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.348
He fought with his CO,
got court-martialed,

26:51.392 --> 26:53.437
sentenced to seven years
in supermax.

26:53.481 --> 26:56.658
While inside,
Conlan'’s son was killed
in action

26:56.702 --> 26:59.095
and he was refused permission
to attend the funeral.

26:59.139 --> 27:02.185
Somewhere in there,
he discovered
his spiritual side.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.100
Got out ten years ago.

27:04.144 --> 27:07.408
Ever since,
Conlan'’s been working
as a prison counselor.

27:07.451 --> 27:10.150
Everyone we speak to says
he'’s a pillar of the community.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.848
Best thing since Mr. Rogers.

27:12.892 --> 27:17.461
Now that he'’s been ID'ed,
FBI link him for 21 homicides,

27:17.505 --> 27:19.246
eight armed bank robberies.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.205
Never showed his face
before last night,

27:22.249 --> 27:24.991
when he busted out your bestie,
Casey Rhodes,

27:25.034 --> 27:27.036
and other hard-core degenerates.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.649
Why didn'’t you break out?

27:35.784 --> 27:38.526
[scoffs]
I'’m wasting my time here.

27:38.569 --> 27:42.486
Whenever I had a tough case,
I remind myself one thing.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.098
What?

27:45.141 --> 27:48.579
Everyone bleeds.You can'’t be saying
shit like that.

27:48.623 --> 27:52.627
You are about to stand trial
for the murder of two suspects.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.020
I killed more than two.

27:54.063 --> 27:56.544
Okay, that is not something
to be proud of.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.502
I killed some bad guys.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.159
It was a good day.

28:03.203 --> 28:05.031
Everyone has a right
to due process.

28:05.074 --> 28:08.730
You swore an oath
to serve and protect.

28:08.774 --> 28:09.992
I own what I did.

28:11.298 --> 28:14.301
You'’re a disgrace.
You'’re a vigilante.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.042
Why didn'’t you break out?

28:21.787 --> 28:22.831
I'’m a cop.

28:23.963 --> 28:25.747
It'’s how I'm wired.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.314
I believe in the rule
of the law.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.751
You are not a cop.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.885
You are a criminal
who had a badge

28:32.928 --> 28:35.757
and thought it gave him
the right to do
whatever the hell he wanted.

28:38.629 --> 28:39.718
I need your help.

28:42.329 --> 28:45.724
I need you to pretend
to be a cop one more time.

28:47.943 --> 28:48.988
I don'’t like you.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.731
I don'’t respect you.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.863
But you can do things
I cannot do.

28:56.691 --> 28:57.953
In another life,

28:59.259 --> 29:00.347
Conlan is you.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.699
The drive,
the self-righteousness.

29:06.179 --> 29:07.963
[sighs]

29:08.007 --> 29:09.660
Stop Ricky Conlan

29:09.704 --> 29:12.663
and the DA will drop
all charges against you.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.884
Why me?

29:15.928 --> 29:18.539
'’Cause you could have broke out
with the rest of the guys
in your cell block

29:18.582 --> 29:20.019
and you chose not to.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.022
You chose to do the right thing.

29:24.893 --> 29:27.896
You'’re no better
than the guys you killed
or locked up,

29:27.940 --> 29:30.159
but there'’s still good in you.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.466
And because you'’re
the only guy I know

29:32.509 --> 29:34.250
who might be crazier
than Ricky is.

29:35.077 --> 29:36.600
I am flattered.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.820
But understand this.

29:38.864 --> 29:43.129
He'’s not robbing banks.
He'’s putting on a show.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.217
How do you know that?

29:44.260 --> 29:46.045
Think like a criminal.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.438
It tracks.

29:48.482 --> 29:49.744
Any leads?

29:51.180 --> 29:52.965
Wanna hear a bad joke?

29:53.008 --> 29:54.618
Always.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.622
When the last bank was hit
in Midtown,

30:00.450 --> 30:02.626
someone had an appointment
with the manager

30:02.670 --> 30:04.803
at the same time
and didn'’t show.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.153
Guess who it was.The pope?

30:07.196 --> 30:08.937
Close.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.939
Vassetti.The mayor.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.680
One and only.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.508
Someone tipped him off.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.163
Yeah.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.004
[sighs]

30:41.665 --> 30:44.364
Tell me I'’m not
making the worst decision
of my life.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.933
I wanna catch this guy.

30:47.976 --> 30:52.024
Give me my gun,
and I'’ll do the rest.

30:52.067 --> 30:55.941
Conlan comes to me alive.
Got it?

30:55.984 --> 30:58.857
James Knight
versus a psychotic bank robber.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.122
Let'’s hope
the city'’s still standing
come Christmas morning.

31:04.471 --> 31:07.866
[piano playing][horn honks in distance]

31:14.307 --> 31:15.917
[Rhodes] He seems
like a lot of fun.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.745
He'’s probably a Jets fan.

31:17.788 --> 31:19.965
[scoffs]

31:20.008 --> 31:22.793
Look, I'’m not really
into this cult shit.
Let'’s get the fuck out of here.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.273
[Conlan laughs][piano stops]

31:24.317 --> 31:26.449
How are the libations,
my brothers?

31:26.493 --> 31:27.842
[Mercer whispers] Let'’s go.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.322
Hear what he has to say
and leave?

31:29.365 --> 31:32.281
When that man speaks,
you listen.

31:35.154 --> 31:39.375
Dajon barks like a dog,
but he'’s a loyal one.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.210
My brothers...

31:51.387 --> 31:54.086
the time is upon us
for the great liberation.

31:54.129 --> 31:58.394
But I ask you one small favor.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.179
I ask you to trust.

32:01.397 --> 32:04.400
Trust that together
we can change the world.

32:04.444 --> 32:07.360
Trust that when we move as one,

32:07.403 --> 32:13.583
that those sheep out there
will tremble in fear
at the sight of us.

32:15.324 --> 32:19.938
There are more people
in prison in this country

32:19.981 --> 32:22.418
than any other nation
on the planet.

32:22.462 --> 32:28.337
74% of souls in cages
haven'’t even been convicted

32:28.381 --> 32:30.252
of a crime.

32:30.296 --> 32:34.735
They'’re in there
because they can'’t afford
to pay bail.

32:34.778 --> 32:39.435
They can'’t even
pay their mortgage, their rent,

32:39.479 --> 32:43.178
while their brothers
in their mansions laugh at them.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.008
We'’re persecuting the poor.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.836
It makes my blood boil.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.623
And I was a soldier
for this country.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.585
I spilled blood in countries
you can'’t even find on a map.

33:01.762 --> 33:05.853
They asked me to execute people
who did not deserve to die.

33:05.896 --> 33:09.944
And when I stood against them,
they threw me in a cage too.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.164
Yes, they did.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.429
And then when my son died
in combat...

33:20.955 --> 33:24.480
[sniffles, sobs]

33:24.524 --> 33:27.701
...I couldn'’t even see
my own son'’s body
be lowered into the ground.

33:29.746 --> 33:31.444
Tell me that'’s not cruel.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.621
Tell me that'’s not torture.

33:37.667 --> 33:43.978
The corruption of this sick
and diseased civilization,

33:45.675 --> 33:47.068
we have to wipe it out.

33:47.112 --> 33:50.593
We have to burn their sick egos
to the ground

33:50.637 --> 33:54.945
and raise this whole country
and start fresh and anew.

33:58.514 --> 34:00.473
Look at this holiday.

34:00.516 --> 34:02.953
Christmas. [laughs]

34:02.997 --> 34:04.694
They'’ve perverted
this holiday.

34:04.738 --> 34:08.524
They'’ve turned it into
a giant mall of consumerism.

34:08.568 --> 34:11.875
We have to take it back.
We have to make it ours.

34:11.919 --> 34:15.401
This blessed day
will no longer be corrupted
by their ugliness.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.491
We will bring that change.

34:18.534 --> 34:21.233
Because this is war.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.061
And there will be no prisoners.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.455
And when they think
of Christmas...

34:28.544 --> 34:30.024
...they will think of us.

34:33.027 --> 34:37.945
But those of you
who do not want to be here
for this great liberation...

34:40.339 --> 34:41.514
...there'’s the door.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.962
No offense, no disrespect,
but, uh, yeah, fellas, I'’m out.
Feliz Navidad.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.137
Pussy.

34:56.181 --> 34:59.662
No, no, no. No, Dajon.[door opens]

34:59.706 --> 35:01.882
That man wants to be free.[door closes]

35:01.925 --> 35:03.927
And our gift to him
is his freedom.

35:05.364 --> 35:08.323
Just make sure he finds
the right way out.

35:12.458 --> 35:15.374
[door opens][footsteps recede]

35:15.417 --> 35:17.376
Celebrate tonight, my brothers.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.509
Tomorrow, we begin.

35:25.645 --> 35:26.907
Brother Rhodes.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.127
You'’re not drinking.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.173
No. No, I'’m, uh--

35:32.217 --> 35:34.306
You know, I'’m not thirsty, so...

35:35.176 --> 35:36.221
Don'’t lie to me.

35:38.353 --> 35:41.574
Don'’t lie to me
and don'’t ever cover for anyone.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.842
Uh, Father, uh...

35:48.885 --> 35:51.149
[clears throat]
A favor to ask you.No.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.064
Don'’t even know
what I'’m gonna ask you.

35:54.108 --> 35:56.458
You wanna call your family
and tell them you'’re okay.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.113
No.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.770
What if I make a trade with you?[packet crinkles]

36:06.860 --> 36:09.515
[Conlan laughs]

36:09.558 --> 36:12.996
You'’ve realized you're more
than your addiction.

36:14.128 --> 36:15.260
Very good.

36:17.392 --> 36:18.872
Make it quick.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.230
Nice speech.

36:30.927 --> 36:34.322
You'’ll have a nice day
on the swings.
It'’s gonna be so fun.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.410
Yeah.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.499
God.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.240
Look,
stop following us, okay?

36:39.284 --> 36:41.024
I don'’t know where Casey is.

36:42.765 --> 36:44.463
Ugh. I'’m sorry, honey.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.768
It'’s okay.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.988
[sighs] Are you okay?

36:48.031 --> 36:49.685
Yeah.Yeah?

36:51.600 --> 36:54.647
Well, I had a nightmare.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.084
Yeah?

36:57.127 --> 36:59.913
Daddy never came home
because he was drowning.

36:59.956 --> 37:03.090
I tried to save him,
but I couldn'’t.

37:03.133 --> 37:04.831
[sighs]

37:04.874 --> 37:07.050
I'’m sorry, sweetheart.

37:07.094 --> 37:09.183
Can I call him?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.663
Not today.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.404
There'’s gonna be no crying
in this household

37:12.447 --> 37:13.709
over Daddy, okay?[phone vibrating]

37:13.753 --> 37:15.233
Okay.Okay?

37:15.276 --> 37:17.322
Mommy is getting a phone call.
But go-- go play.

37:17.365 --> 37:18.410
Okay.

37:19.019 --> 37:20.150
[sighs]

37:23.937 --> 37:27.549
Hello?[Rhodes] Hello, this is from the
department of absentee fathers.

37:27.593 --> 37:28.942
Calling again.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.422
Hi, Mom.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.120
What the fuck are you doing?

37:33.163 --> 37:34.817
[sighs]
How are you holding up?

37:35.905 --> 37:36.950
Not great.

37:38.604 --> 37:39.648
How is she doing?

37:39.692 --> 37:42.912
[sighs] She'’s confused.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.306
More questions every day,
wondering where her dad is,

37:45.350 --> 37:48.657
and why I don'’t let her
watch the TV.

37:49.702 --> 37:52.313
Look, please don'’t tell me
that you'’re--

37:52.357 --> 37:53.923
you'’re part of the jailbreak.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.534
[Rhodes sighs]

37:55.577 --> 37:59.189
I, uh, kind of got mixed up
in it, darling.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.757
I don'’t know how it happened,
but...

38:03.542 --> 38:06.109
[sighs]
...I couldn'’t spend
another day in that cell.

38:06.153 --> 38:08.111
How could you be so stupid?

38:08.155 --> 38:10.418
Pretty much used up
all the stupid
getting this far, huh?

38:10.462 --> 38:15.945
They say the guy
who orchestrated the jailbreak
is-- is the Christmas bomber.

38:15.989 --> 38:19.427
Honestly, I'’d rather you be
inside and alive than--

38:19.471 --> 38:20.602
Instead of what?

38:21.908 --> 38:24.432
Dead?
Inside is pretty much
the same exact thing.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.956
Ugh, God.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.002
I just feel like you don'’t--
you don'’t think.

38:29.045 --> 38:31.047
You don'’t think at all.
You don'’t fucking think.

38:31.091 --> 38:33.180
No, I can fix this, darling. No, you can'’t.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.791
You can'’t fucking fix this.

38:35.835 --> 38:41.188
You sound like an addict. I'’m with Conlan right now, okay?
I can maybe cut a deal.

38:41.231 --> 38:44.017
I need you to call the police,
tell them what
I just told you, okay?

38:46.541 --> 38:48.413
I'’m gonna text you
the address right now.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.330
Don'’t give up on me, okay?

38:54.506 --> 38:55.550
I love you.

38:58.205 --> 38:59.424
Prove it.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.437
[cell phone beeps]

39:25.014 --> 39:26.451
Casey Rhodes.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.281
We had such high hopes for you.

39:38.463 --> 39:39.464
What?

39:40.552 --> 39:41.553
Put her through.

39:42.945 --> 39:46.427
[sighs]
Mrs. Rhodes,
what can I do for you?

39:46.471 --> 39:49.343
Casey called me.
He'’s with the bomber.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.866
When did you talk to him?

39:50.910 --> 39:53.173
Just now.Did he give you an address?

39:53.216 --> 39:56.568
Look, I need your word
that all the charges
against Casey will be dropped.

39:56.611 --> 39:59.092
Full immunity.I can say with confidence

39:59.135 --> 40:03.139
that the mayor
and the DA'’s office
would be willing to cut a deal.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.838
Send me something in writing,
and I'’ll send you the address.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.143
[engine starts]

40:42.527 --> 40:44.572
[people clamoring]

40:51.144 --> 40:52.450
[grunts]

40:53.189 --> 40:55.322
Oh, God. [groans]

40:56.192 --> 40:57.629
[both grunt]

40:59.021 --> 41:01.763
[officer] Hold it!
Hold it right there!

41:03.765 --> 41:05.811
[grunts]

41:06.551 --> 41:07.595
[handcuffs crank]

41:07.639 --> 41:09.554
[helicopter whirring]

41:13.862 --> 41:15.603
[Knight] This was his B team.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.953
Conlan left 20 minutes
before we showed up.

41:17.997 --> 41:19.607
He might have been tipped off.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.653
[captain] I put my ass
on the line for you.

41:21.696 --> 41:23.524
I got you out to get results.

41:23.568 --> 41:27.397
His team prepped here.
They paid cash.

41:27.441 --> 41:31.227
The landlord has no idea. None.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.229
They don'’t know where he is.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.797
Conlan is always one step ahead.

41:35.841 --> 41:37.495
Do the Feds have anything?

41:37.538 --> 41:39.409
They know less than we do.

41:39.453 --> 41:42.021
There'’s only one witness
that we haven'’t questioned.

41:45.154 --> 41:46.808
We cannot get
the mayor involved.

41:46.852 --> 41:49.071
You said to do
whatever it takes.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.509
This is what it takes.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.423
[sighs]

41:56.165 --> 41:59.473
All right, I'’ll--
I'’ll meet with him, okay?

41:59.517 --> 42:01.127
You'’re a good one, Captain.

42:02.389 --> 42:03.825
Don'’t I know it.

42:13.835 --> 42:15.881
[cello playing "Deck the Halls"]

42:37.642 --> 42:39.731
Hey, my son plays the cello.

42:39.774 --> 42:43.256
Yeah, you'’re pretty good at it.[cello stops]

42:43.299 --> 42:45.867
No, no, don'’t--
don'’t stop, please.

42:45.911 --> 42:48.435
You try playing for four hours.

42:48.478 --> 42:50.916
Uh, that'’ll be a hard pass.

42:50.959 --> 42:52.570
Exactly.

42:53.658 --> 42:54.746
You a cop?

42:56.443 --> 42:57.879
Why?

42:58.488 --> 42:59.925
Fuck the police.

43:05.234 --> 43:06.496
Charming.

43:29.955 --> 43:31.609
[car horn honks]

43:39.921 --> 43:43.533
[parent] Arthur,
we need to discuss
where you were last night.

43:43.577 --> 43:45.971
We'’re gonna have
to have a conversation.

43:46.014 --> 43:47.363
["Deck the Halls" continues]

43:47.407 --> 43:48.451
[clears throat]

43:54.936 --> 43:57.504
Welcome to my home, sir.[chuckles]

43:58.766 --> 44:00.072
[clears throat]

44:00.115 --> 44:01.900
Anyone thinking of donating
to the city,

44:01.943 --> 44:03.728
well, is a friend of mine.

44:04.729 --> 44:05.947
Ah, yeah.

44:05.991 --> 44:08.341
Yeah, that was just a lie

44:08.384 --> 44:12.084
so I was able to get
an appointment with you
on shorter notice.

44:12.127 --> 44:14.042
I'’m not even a constituent.

44:14.086 --> 44:16.044
And I definitely wouldn'’t
vote for you.

44:16.088 --> 44:20.832
But I do have this.

44:22.529 --> 44:23.748
Los Angeles.

44:23.791 --> 44:25.750
You'’re out of your jurisdiction.

44:25.793 --> 44:27.229
And you'’re wasting my time.

44:27.273 --> 44:29.536
And you'’re letting
a madman blow up banks.

44:29.579 --> 44:31.973
So I guess you and I
have a lot to talk about.

44:32.017 --> 44:34.759
[clears throat][chuckles]

44:34.802 --> 44:37.718
Man, I wish I had a seat
at your weekly poker game,

44:37.762 --> 44:40.416
because you lie for shit.

44:40.460 --> 44:43.942
Now, why did you miss
your appointment at the bank

44:43.985 --> 44:45.508
the day that it was blowing up?

44:46.248 --> 44:47.554
Midtown traffic.

44:48.424 --> 44:49.991
What was the appointment for?

44:50.035 --> 44:52.646
Hmm? What, you need a loan?

44:52.690 --> 44:57.390
I was, uh,
looking to close out
my safety deposit box.

44:58.783 --> 45:01.350
And Ricky Conlan beat you to it.

45:01.394 --> 45:03.265
Hmm.What was in it?

45:04.397 --> 45:06.878
Nothing of importance.Come on.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.010
No blood diamonds?

45:09.054 --> 45:12.405
No photos of you
in a little white robe
with a little pointy hat?

45:13.754 --> 45:14.755
No.

45:15.887 --> 45:18.498
Come on. What does Conlan have
on you, huh?

45:18.541 --> 45:20.282
Video of you fucking the maid?

45:20.326 --> 45:21.762
[cello stops]

45:23.198 --> 45:24.765
Arthur?

45:26.593 --> 45:27.681
Again, please.

45:28.856 --> 45:30.597
Really sweet kid.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.077
[cello playing resumes]

45:32.120 --> 45:35.036
Well, I need to prepare
for my press conference.

45:35.080 --> 45:38.823
Of course.
You gotta rehearse
all that bullshit.

45:38.866 --> 45:41.216
Thank you
for your service, Officer.

45:41.260 --> 45:43.741
Actually, that'’s "Detective."

45:44.916 --> 45:46.961
I'’m sorry
I couldn'’t be more help.

45:47.005 --> 45:48.441
Oh, don'’t be sorry.

45:48.484 --> 45:50.356
No, you were
a great deal of help.

45:51.574 --> 45:52.924
After you.

45:58.451 --> 46:01.236
[clears throat]
Oh, you know what?
[chuckles]

46:01.280 --> 46:03.848
No, ah,
there'’s just, um--

46:03.891 --> 46:05.719
I just have one more thing.

46:05.763 --> 46:09.201
Mm-hmm.Do you still have
safety deposit boxes?

46:09.244 --> 46:10.985
Now, why would you
want to know that?

46:11.029 --> 46:14.206
Ah, just after Conlan'’s heist,
where did you move them to?

46:14.249 --> 46:16.991
I consolidated them
into one location.

46:17.035 --> 46:18.776
And where would that be?

46:20.168 --> 46:21.953
An impenetrable bank.

46:23.041 --> 46:25.217
Few know the actual location.

46:26.653 --> 46:30.570
Consider it a Fort Knox
for the 1%.

46:30.613 --> 46:34.182
Ah. Well, Mr. Mayor,

46:34.226 --> 46:38.012
I think that you and I are
gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

46:39.579 --> 46:40.885
I look forward to it.

46:41.711 --> 46:42.756
Good.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.760
[grunts]

46:47.805 --> 46:49.241
Oh, and, uh,

46:49.284 --> 46:51.547
what'’s your wrist size,
Mr. Mayor?

46:51.591 --> 46:55.334
I'’d love to send you a nice
little fuzzy pair of handcuffs
for Christmas.

46:59.991 --> 47:02.428
You can keep the itinerary.

47:02.471 --> 47:03.516
Blow me.

47:15.354 --> 47:17.399
[police radio chatter]

47:29.368 --> 47:30.586
What the--

47:31.805 --> 47:33.763
How'’d you get in here?

47:33.807 --> 47:36.114
Well, that'’s between me
and the door.

47:39.204 --> 47:42.207
Get out from behind my desk.
I asked you a ques-- Oh.

47:42.250 --> 47:43.948
You'’re in a wheelchair.

47:43.991 --> 47:46.385
Bullets didn'’t hit my spine,
so if I stay off my feet,

47:46.428 --> 47:48.213
I'’ll be up and running
by Memorial Day.

47:48.256 --> 47:50.780
[sighs] How the hell did you
get in here?

47:50.824 --> 47:55.394
Yeah, well, you'’re a detective.
You figure it out.

47:55.437 --> 47:58.963
You flew all the way
from LA to New York
to bust into my office?

47:59.006 --> 48:01.835
Oh, and I might as well
tell you now,

48:01.879 --> 48:04.011
because you will find out.

48:04.055 --> 48:06.231
I paid a visit to the mayor.

48:06.274 --> 48:08.102
Man, I can'’t believe...[cell phone pings]

48:08.146 --> 48:11.323
...he'’s such a bad liar.
He'’s made it so far in politics.

48:11.366 --> 48:13.891
[scoffs]
Now he'’s messaging me,

48:13.934 --> 48:17.068
asking me why some LA cop
is asking him questions.

48:17.111 --> 48:18.373
Because he'’s involved.

48:18.417 --> 48:20.114
[sighs]

48:21.637 --> 48:24.858
This could be
the biggest scandal
in the history of the city.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.469
I know Conlan'’s got
something on the mayor.

48:27.513 --> 48:31.212
Let'’s just hope if
Knight finds out what it is,
he'’ll do the right thing.

48:31.256 --> 48:33.911
Yeah, Knight will play
by the book.

48:33.954 --> 48:35.825
I have a feeling his
definition of "by the book"

48:35.869 --> 48:39.220
is to beat a guy to death
with a book.

48:41.135 --> 48:42.745
Find anything on Conlan?

48:42.789 --> 48:43.964
No.

48:44.008 --> 48:46.053
He wants to rid the world
of money,

48:46.097 --> 48:47.925
yet he is playing Santa Claus.

48:47.968 --> 48:49.709
He does one thing, says another.

48:49.752 --> 48:53.452
I think that he wants the world
to believe he'’s an animal.

48:54.888 --> 48:56.455
So find out
who'’s holding the leash.

48:56.498 --> 48:57.935
Yes, ma'’am.

48:59.197 --> 49:02.983
The first question is,
where is my partner?

49:04.202 --> 49:06.595
You'’re a detective.
Figure it out.

49:08.946 --> 49:09.990
[chuckles]

49:10.034 --> 49:11.992
Thank you all for coming.

49:12.036 --> 49:14.864
I am putting Ricky Conlan
on notice.

49:14.908 --> 49:16.866
We will apprehend you.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.870
I am also putting
the police department

49:20.914 --> 49:23.961
and Captain Anna Shea
on notice.

49:24.004 --> 49:26.964
I will come after you
if you fail in your directive.

49:27.007 --> 49:29.705
[voices chanting, echoing]
Ho! Ho!

49:29.749 --> 49:32.317
[Vassetti] Ricky Conlan is not
some sort of Robin Hood.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.448
[Conlan] Get down!

49:33.492 --> 49:34.667
[all scream]

49:34.710 --> 49:36.756
Merry fucking Christmas!

49:36.799 --> 49:38.018
[Dajon] Eyes on the ground.

49:38.062 --> 49:39.889
You understand the problem?

49:39.933 --> 49:42.675
You wanna see my face?
Look at me, motherfucker!

49:42.718 --> 49:44.198
Don'’t move!

49:44.242 --> 49:47.462
[Conlan] I want my present!

49:47.506 --> 49:49.899
He'’s a criminal
of the lowest kind.

49:49.943 --> 49:52.641
I am here to save you!

49:52.685 --> 49:54.817
Look at this god
you worship. Stand up.

49:55.949 --> 50:00.562
[panting] This is not Christmas!

50:02.651 --> 50:04.740
You wanna worship money
your whole life?

50:04.784 --> 50:07.613
You see how well it spends
when you'’re in hell.

50:08.962 --> 50:11.530
Wait, no. I have a family.[hostages scream, gasp]

50:11.573 --> 50:13.662
Let'’s go.[hostage crying]

50:13.706 --> 50:18.580
[Vassetti] I urge you not to buy
into his call to arms,

50:18.624 --> 50:24.369
and see it as nothing
but a smoke screen
to hide his criminal activity.

50:24.412 --> 50:27.763
He is recruiting ex-convicts.

50:27.807 --> 50:30.418
He is attempting
to brainwash them...Merry Christmas.

50:30.462 --> 50:33.247
...so they can join his cause.[grenade clatters on floor]

50:35.293 --> 50:38.600
If there is anyone found
aiding Ricky Conlan,

50:40.124 --> 50:42.082
you will feel the full force
of this city

50:42.126 --> 50:45.129
brought to bear upon your heads.

50:46.608 --> 50:48.393
Now, if you have any questions,

50:50.047 --> 50:53.093
ask Captain Anna Shea

50:53.137 --> 50:55.748
and see what answers
she gives you. Thank you.

50:57.315 --> 50:59.534
-Motherfucker!
-[grunts]

50:59.578 --> 51:00.927
You wanna sell us out?

51:00.970 --> 51:04.409
Sell out a great man
like Conlan?

51:04.452 --> 51:07.760
I heard you call
your ball and chain,
motherfucker.

51:07.803 --> 51:10.154
The fuck is wrong with you?

51:11.024 --> 51:12.939
Oh, it'’s a long list, brother.

51:15.420 --> 51:17.509
He could have done for you
what he did for me.

51:17.552 --> 51:20.120
He took me from the streets
and gave me purpose,

51:20.164 --> 51:21.730
made me real.

51:23.167 --> 51:25.691
Disappointment is
a hell of a thing.

51:30.565 --> 51:32.698
Do unto others...[groans]

51:32.741 --> 51:35.570
...as you would have them
do unto you.

51:35.614 --> 51:37.006
[Conlan chuckles]

51:37.050 --> 51:39.531
You wanted them
to shoot me down like a dog.

51:39.574 --> 51:40.662
No.

51:40.706 --> 51:42.882
Why did you try
to cut a deal?

51:42.925 --> 51:44.449
Come on,
you were gonna burn my ass

51:44.492 --> 51:45.928
to save yours, weren'’t you?

51:45.972 --> 51:47.495
No, no, no. That'’s not what--

51:47.539 --> 51:50.194
-Don'’t you lie to me.
-Okay.

51:50.237 --> 51:53.327
Yeah, okay. I may be a liar,
but I'’m not fucking crazy.

51:54.459 --> 51:57.244
[Rhodes groaning]

51:57.288 --> 51:59.812
[Conlan]
Well, in a society like this,

51:59.855 --> 52:03.381
being crazy could be
a beautiful thing.

52:03.424 --> 52:05.165
You know?[panting]

52:05.209 --> 52:09.778
So let me ask you one more time.

52:11.650 --> 52:16.089
Did you try to cut a deal

52:16.133 --> 52:19.092
with the New York
pig department?[groans, pants] F--

52:20.702 --> 52:22.835
[Conlan] All I'’m asking for
is the truth.

52:23.836 --> 52:26.273
All I want,
just the truth, son.

52:26.317 --> 52:29.711
Just fucking kill me, man.
Let'’s get it over with.

52:29.755 --> 52:32.801
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don'’t understand.

52:32.845 --> 52:34.890
You don'’t under--
This is not your fault.

52:35.935 --> 52:37.502
No, no. Th--

52:37.545 --> 52:40.157
This is part of
the great deception
of the liars.

52:40.200 --> 52:43.072
They used you
just like they used me.

52:43.116 --> 52:44.509
Don'’t you see?

52:44.552 --> 52:46.859
They distracted us
with all the-- the splendor,

52:46.902 --> 52:48.687
and the gold, and the--
and the-- and the--

52:48.730 --> 52:52.343
and the pageantry
and the theatrics. Right?

52:52.386 --> 52:55.128
"You'’re doing
such a good job, son.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.217
Well done
servicing your country."[gunfire]

52:57.261 --> 52:59.828
[people clamor][Conlan] Right? Patriotism,
xenophobia.

52:59.872 --> 53:02.744
This jingoism
they filled in our heads,
and they walked us out there.

53:02.788 --> 53:04.485
And they gave you--

53:04.529 --> 53:06.618
They gave you a pigskin.

53:06.661 --> 53:08.794
And they said, "You carry it
from one end of the battlefield
to the other."

53:08.837 --> 53:11.492
And they handed me a rifle,
and they taught me how to kill.

53:11.536 --> 53:14.321
He knows things, man.
He'’s a truth teller.

53:14.365 --> 53:16.323
Hey, fuck you.

53:17.542 --> 53:19.674
[Conlan] No, no,
don'’t be angry at him.

53:19.718 --> 53:23.200
Come on. You'’re angry at the
system that left you deserted

53:23.243 --> 53:25.158
on the shores of poverty
and dissolution

53:25.202 --> 53:26.942
without a cause to believe in.

53:26.986 --> 53:28.596
But I'’ve got that fixed.[groans]

53:28.640 --> 53:29.902
'’Cause you and I are the same.

53:29.945 --> 53:32.252
We'’re both from
the same society.

53:33.732 --> 53:36.256
We didn'’t do anything
wrong here. We'’re not criminals.

53:37.388 --> 53:39.216
We'’re protagonists
in our own story.

53:39.259 --> 53:41.522
[Rhodes] Sure, man. Yeah.

53:41.566 --> 53:44.569
I get it, that makes sense.
That makes sense, sure.

53:45.526 --> 53:47.006
I want the truth.

53:48.921 --> 53:52.011
[groans]I want the truth.

53:52.054 --> 53:53.621
[panting]

53:56.145 --> 53:58.452
Your faith isn'’t strong enough
to get you to the next chapter,

53:58.496 --> 53:59.540
my son.

54:01.107 --> 54:03.501
[grunts] I got
to make you make a choice.

54:04.632 --> 54:06.068
I really hate doing this,

54:06.112 --> 54:07.635
but I have to
show you something.

54:07.679 --> 54:09.463
It'’s good. It's kind of bad.

54:09.507 --> 54:11.726
But one day, I promise,
you'’re gonna thank me for it.

54:20.082 --> 54:22.955
No. No, no, no! Fuck you!

54:22.998 --> 54:24.348
[panting] No!

54:24.391 --> 54:27.612
No, no, I tried--
I tried to fuck you, okay?

54:27.655 --> 54:29.657
I'’m a piece of shit, okay?

54:29.701 --> 54:31.268
I'’m-- I'm a drug addict.

54:31.311 --> 54:32.443
Just let them go.

54:32.486 --> 54:33.835
Fuck you! Let them go!

54:33.879 --> 54:35.402
Fuck you! Let them go!

54:35.446 --> 54:37.056
[panting]Shh.

54:43.758 --> 54:44.890
There you go.

54:44.933 --> 54:46.718
There you go. Look at me.

54:46.761 --> 54:48.241
Look at me. Look at me.

54:58.512 --> 55:00.862
Okay, okay, okay.

55:00.906 --> 55:02.168
[Conlan laughs]

55:02.211 --> 55:04.301
That'’s the spirit.

55:04.344 --> 55:08.174
But you shoot me, they all die.

55:09.218 --> 55:12.874
Okay? You shoot yourself,
they all die.

55:14.485 --> 55:15.921
Okay, you have to
make a choice now.

55:15.964 --> 55:18.619
You have to make a choice
so you can be free.

55:18.663 --> 55:19.968
What'’s the choice?

55:20.969 --> 55:22.667
Bring him in.What?

55:22.710 --> 55:24.669
[Conlan] Now make a decision
and set yourself free.

55:24.712 --> 55:26.192
Ah, fuck.

55:26.235 --> 55:27.933
Oh, it'’s your brother.

55:27.976 --> 55:30.501
[Rhodes] He wasn'’t part of this.
This is me.

55:30.544 --> 55:32.416
[Conlan] This is the choice
that gives you your freedom.

55:32.459 --> 55:34.722
[Rhodes] I alerted the cops.[Conlan] Your family
or your brother?

55:34.766 --> 55:36.898
Okay, we already know
what you'’re gonna choose.

55:36.942 --> 55:38.596
Right? Look what he'’s done
to you.

55:39.858 --> 55:43.383
He brought you to the bookie
that you had to kill.

55:43.427 --> 55:45.820
He-- He got you to--
to rob banks.

55:45.864 --> 55:48.562
He taught you how to shoot
a gun. That'’s the guy.

55:48.606 --> 55:49.868
Hurry it up. We got
a world to save.

55:49.911 --> 55:51.826
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

55:53.437 --> 55:55.177
Him or your family.

55:55.221 --> 55:56.962
One has to die.

55:57.005 --> 55:59.138
Come on, Casey. You'’ve already
made your fucking decision.

55:59.181 --> 56:00.966
Come on.

56:03.055 --> 56:04.230
Just do it.

56:05.100 --> 56:06.363
I'’m sorry, man.

56:06.406 --> 56:07.973
Fuck, I'’m sorry, brother.No, no.

56:09.496 --> 56:11.455
-I'’m so sorry.
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

56:11.498 --> 56:12.760
[gun clicks]

56:13.979 --> 56:16.895
[laughing]

56:16.938 --> 56:18.287
Fuck.

56:19.985 --> 56:21.769
I'’m sorry, but I had to see.

56:21.813 --> 56:23.597
[Mercer] Well, fuck you, man.

56:23.641 --> 56:25.251
You sick fuck.

56:25.294 --> 56:26.774
You actually pulled the trigger?

56:26.818 --> 56:28.515
[Conlan] I had to know for sure.

56:28.559 --> 56:30.430
You are a true believer.

56:30.474 --> 56:31.736
I knew you had it in you.

56:31.779 --> 56:34.478
I am so goddamn proud of you.

56:35.217 --> 56:36.741
Oh, Casey.

56:36.784 --> 56:37.916
My man.

56:40.309 --> 56:42.268
What'’s wrong with you
fucking people?

56:42.311 --> 56:43.835
Look, I woke up this morning

56:43.878 --> 56:45.924
and I thought, my God,
I have everything

56:45.967 --> 56:49.188
I need in my life
except one thing.

56:49.231 --> 56:52.060
[grunts] Yeah, what'’s that?

56:52.104 --> 56:53.627
Your fucking sanity?

56:56.282 --> 56:57.414
You.

57:03.202 --> 57:05.378
-[gunshot]
-Oh, fuck.

57:28.053 --> 57:29.446
When was the last time
you slept?

57:30.490 --> 57:32.144
I caught an hour
in the break room.

57:33.058 --> 57:35.321
We get any word from Knight?

57:35.364 --> 57:37.758
He'’s probably halfway
to Argentina by now.

57:38.846 --> 57:41.109
Nah, he wouldn'’t run
from a fight.

57:41.153 --> 57:42.807
Nah, you wanna think
the worst of him,

57:42.850 --> 57:46.158
but he'’ll be there
when the time comes.No.

57:46.201 --> 57:48.421
You know, just because you
don'’t want something to happen

57:48.465 --> 57:50.162
doesn'’t mean it won't.

57:50.205 --> 57:52.338
I'’m a single mother, Fitz.

57:52.381 --> 57:55.297
I'’m well aware of making plans
and having God interfere.

57:57.386 --> 57:59.519
Seeing as how
you'’re already pissed off

57:59.563 --> 58:02.217
and messing around
in my city without authority...

58:07.309 --> 58:08.789
What?

58:08.833 --> 58:09.921
Casey Rhodes.

58:10.530 --> 58:11.618
What about him?

58:12.924 --> 58:15.535
He busted out with Conlan
during the jailbreak.

58:15.579 --> 58:17.755
Called his wife.
She cut a deal with us.

58:17.798 --> 58:20.845
You cut a deal with the man who
put me in this fucking chair?

58:20.888 --> 58:23.369
I want my city to be safe.

58:23.412 --> 58:25.414
It'’s a means to an end.

58:27.591 --> 58:29.157
You find anything on Conlan?

58:31.725 --> 58:34.859
[sighs] The guy'’s talking
like he'’s about to pull off

58:34.902 --> 58:37.078
the biggest heist in history.

58:38.471 --> 58:42.301
Look, I'’ve been doing some
research on potential targets.

58:42.344 --> 58:46.435
Okay? And right now, the record
is the Cali truck job in '’97.

58:46.479 --> 58:48.220
The take was over 30 mil.

58:49.003 --> 58:50.265
Mm-mmm.

58:50.309 --> 58:53.051
Biggest heist was in '’75.

58:53.094 --> 58:55.401
Eight guys hit a secret bank
owned by the mob.

58:56.620 --> 58:58.709
A secret bank?

58:58.752 --> 59:02.147
Conlan may be crazy,
but he knows better than
to mess with the families.

59:03.496 --> 59:06.368
[softly] Yeah.Look, get some rest.

59:08.414 --> 59:10.024
Knight will be back
at some point.

59:11.373 --> 59:12.418
Yeah.

59:19.164 --> 59:21.775
[scoffs]
Speak of the devil.

59:37.312 --> 59:39.706
They wanna put me on desk duty.
Can you believe that?

59:39.750 --> 59:42.666
Probably for the best.Excuse me?

59:42.709 --> 59:45.451
Why, do you think if a guy
runs up a flight of stairs,

59:45.494 --> 59:46.583
I can'’t catch him?

59:47.932 --> 59:50.674
[chuckles] Oh, you'’re just
full of Christmas spirit,

59:50.717 --> 59:51.849
aren'’t you, huh?

59:51.892 --> 59:53.328
You old bastard.

59:54.939 --> 59:56.941
See, the games have changed,
my brother.

59:56.984 --> 1:00:00.074
There'’s no more rules.
There'’s no more codes.

1:00:00.858 --> 1:00:02.686
The game has changed.

1:00:02.729 --> 1:00:05.602
Yeah, Conlan isn'’t human.

1:00:07.473 --> 1:00:09.431
Look, the captain spoke
to the mayor.

1:00:09.475 --> 1:00:10.955
I spoke to the mayor.

1:00:10.998 --> 1:00:14.698
He-- He had this itinerary
on his desk.

1:00:14.741 --> 1:00:17.744
Some kind of meeting set up at,
I don'’t know,

1:00:17.788 --> 1:00:19.920
Wooddrake Antiques
or something.

with the captain.

And the DA is gonna go for it.

my fucking hands on Rhodes,

and come back to LA.

to lock you up.

Do you know how much shit
Macey is giving me
for even being here?

Okay, fine. You know what?
Don'’t listen to me.

1:01:16.063 --> 1:01:18.718
But Conlan isn'’t like
any other criminal.

1:01:20.024 --> 1:01:22.896
Don'’t let Conlan get
to you like Winna.

than I'’ve had hot meals,

for me to repay the debt.

to eat the rich.

Wondering if he was
meaning that literally.

1:02:54.683 --> 1:02:56.598
I told Conlan where every bank
in this city

1:02:56.642 --> 1:02:58.992
was consolidating its valuables.

1:02:59.036 --> 1:03:00.777

Now, I know Conlan is
a mad son of a bitch.

1:03:59.618 --> 1:04:01.098
But all the great ones are.

1:04:02.403 --> 1:04:04.492
That man has
shown me the truth.

1:04:04.536 --> 1:04:08.061
Every one of us has been
abused, used by the system.

1:04:08.105 --> 1:04:11.151
They have taken our time,
our life.

1:04:11.195 --> 1:04:13.588
They have put us in cages
for crimes that the 1%

1:04:13.632 --> 1:04:14.851
commit every day.

1:04:16.591 --> 1:04:19.594
This city belongs to us.

1:04:20.639 --> 1:04:23.860
It is ours.
And it always has been ours!

1:04:25.078 --> 1:04:27.602
And now it'’s time to make
everybody see the light.

1:04:32.216 --> 1:04:34.131
[Conlan] The plan is simple.

1:04:34.174 --> 1:04:38.918
Thanks to our new brother here,
the mayor will let us in.

1:04:38.962 --> 1:04:41.007
And we'’ll take it from there.

1:04:41.051 --> 1:04:44.358
No prisoners, no survivors.

1:04:45.838 --> 1:04:47.492
Some of you won'’t make it out.

1:04:48.972 --> 1:04:50.495
But upon your fallen bodies,

1:04:50.538 --> 1:04:52.932
we will build the foundation
of this great movement.

1:04:54.107 --> 1:04:57.371
One day, many years from now
when you'’re old,

lying in your deathbed,

1:04:58.677 --> 1:05:01.114
you'’ll look up
at your loved ones

1:05:01.158 --> 1:05:03.029

You said your father
held you down.

1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:24.311
He put his foot on you

1:05:24.355 --> 1:05:25.965
and pushed you to the ground,

1:05:26.009 --> 1:05:27.749

1:05:27.793 --> 1:05:29.534

We had a deal.

1:12:45.926 --> 1:12:49.103
I can give you
anything you want.

1:12:49.147 --> 1:12:50.888
I can give you
the keys to the city.

1:12:50.931 --> 1:12:52.585
The keys to the city?

1:12:52.629 --> 1:12:56.415
Really? You can give me
the keys to the city?

1:12:56.459 --> 1:12:58.504
I don'’t need
the keys to the city

1:12:58.548 --> 1:13:01.725
when I have the keeper of
the keys right here in my van.

1:13:01.768 --> 1:13:03.640
Not like this.

1:13:03.683 --> 1:13:06.077
This is too far.

1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:08.558
You'’re gonna set
the city back 50 years.

1:13:08.601 --> 1:13:10.298
No, no, no, my brother.

1:13:11.430 --> 1:13:14.738
I'’m going to propel
the city into the future.

1:13:14.781 --> 1:13:17.654
We'’re gonna expose
the dark secrets of the elite.

1:13:17.697 --> 1:13:19.264
So lock and load, brothers.

1:13:19.307 --> 1:13:21.092
We got a job to do.

1:13:23.311 --> 1:13:24.704
Smile, Mayor.

1:13:24.748 --> 1:13:26.184
It'’s Christmas.

1:13:26.227 --> 1:13:27.838
[laughs]

1:13:56.867 --> 1:13:58.129
Let the games begin.

1:14:00.784 --> 1:14:03.134
Gonna deck the halls
with blood, motherfuckers.

1:14:03.177 --> 1:14:04.222
Let'’s go.

1:14:04.265 --> 1:14:05.702
The other guys are in position.

1:14:17.061 --> 1:14:18.454
I need to make a withdrawal.

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:22.458
[button beeps]

1:14:29.987 --> 1:14:31.858
[door buzzes]

1:14:38.648 --> 1:14:39.692
How'’s it going?

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.088
Hi.

1:14:44.828 --> 1:14:45.872
[button buzzes]

1:14:53.445 --> 1:14:55.316
You can come in now.

1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:57.014
[Conlan] Uh-uh, don'’t you move.

1:15:04.891 --> 1:15:06.371
Let them have everything!

1:15:07.590 --> 1:15:09.548
Just give them what they want!

1:15:11.855 --> 1:15:14.031
We don'’t have
to be given anything.

1:15:15.075 --> 1:15:17.469
We'’re gonna take everything.

1:15:20.385 --> 1:15:22.387
Let'’s get this party started.

1:15:24.998 --> 1:15:31.004
[bank robbers chanting]
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

1:15:31.048 --> 1:15:36.227
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

1:15:36.270 --> 1:15:40.361
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

1:15:40.405 --> 1:15:43.451
Ho. Ho. Ho.

1:15:43.495 --> 1:15:45.802
Jingle on this, bitches.

1:15:47.325 --> 1:15:50.502
[chanting continues]

1:16:06.736 --> 1:16:08.564
[chanting stops]

1:16:26.799 --> 1:16:29.628
Please, don'’t shoot.
I'’m just the lookout.

1:16:29.672 --> 1:16:31.325
[Arthur sobbing]

1:16:31.369 --> 1:16:33.545
It was never supposed
to be like this.

1:16:33.589 --> 1:16:36.243
Conlan said we were
starting a revolution.

1:16:36.287 --> 1:16:38.158
How many in there?

1:16:38.202 --> 1:16:39.856
Ten, 15.

1:16:40.508 --> 1:16:42.423
I don'’t know.

1:16:42.467 --> 1:16:43.903
But they'’re all cons.

1:16:43.947 --> 1:16:45.688
Hard-core.

1:16:45.731 --> 1:16:47.820
I just wanted to be tough.

1:16:47.864 --> 1:16:49.169
I bet you'’re tough now.

1:16:50.301 --> 1:16:51.389
Fuck off.

1:16:53.739 --> 1:16:58.135
[bank robbers chanting]
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

1:16:58.178 --> 1:17:00.006
Don'’t move.

1:17:00.050 --> 1:17:01.355
[chanting continues]

1:17:03.444 --> 1:17:04.924
Move it.

1:17:07.492 --> 1:17:09.146
Stay frosty, Santas.

1:17:18.459 --> 1:17:19.765
Open the vault.

1:17:20.548 --> 1:17:21.637
Move!

1:17:26.032 --> 1:17:28.774
[chanting continues]

1:17:39.045 --> 1:17:43.876
Oh. Merry Christmas,
my brothers.

1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:46.270
Time to reap the rewards
of your loyalty.

1:17:47.314 --> 1:17:49.099
All this just
to steal some shit?

1:17:49.882 --> 1:17:51.144
[Conlan] No.

1:17:51.188 --> 1:17:52.885
This is about
rebooting the system.

1:17:52.929 --> 1:17:54.365
Oh, bullshit.

1:17:54.408 --> 1:17:56.149
Bullshit, man.
You'’re nothing but a thief.

1:17:56.933 --> 1:17:57.977
No.

1:17:58.543 --> 1:18:00.110
I'’m no thief.

1:18:00.153 --> 1:18:03.417
I'’m just a man who played
the system that made me.

1:18:03.461 --> 1:18:04.984
Shit.

1:18:05.028 --> 1:18:07.378
Part of you believes
in this mission.

1:18:08.379 --> 1:18:10.860
I can see it in your eyes
right there.

1:18:12.426 --> 1:18:13.601
Look at this.

1:18:13.645 --> 1:18:15.691
Look at these riches.

1:18:15.734 --> 1:18:17.823
We can overthrow
governments with this.

1:18:18.911 --> 1:18:22.349
We can bring about
the great liberation.

1:18:22.393 --> 1:18:25.918
This is the beginning
of the unbreaking of humanity.

1:18:25.962 --> 1:18:28.268
My father taught me
to fix what'’s broken.

1:18:29.792 --> 1:18:32.316
Your father was a cuck.

1:18:32.359 --> 1:18:34.840
With the deep state'’s balls...

1:18:34.884 --> 1:18:36.755
[clicking tongue]

1:18:36.799 --> 1:18:38.017
...tickling his tonsils.

1:18:38.061 --> 1:18:39.889
[laughing]

1:18:41.325 --> 1:18:43.936
My father taught me that
if you can'’t change the world,

1:18:45.546 --> 1:18:46.722
bring it to its knees.

1:18:50.464 --> 1:18:52.205
We are so close.

1:18:52.815 --> 1:18:54.730
So close.

1:18:55.992 --> 1:18:57.297
Don'’t you understand?

1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:03.129
They killed my son
with their fake wars.

1:19:04.957 --> 1:19:07.612
I will end them before
they do that to your child.

1:19:09.309 --> 1:19:10.789
I'’m doing this for you.

1:19:11.747 --> 1:19:13.836
Help me, I beg you.

1:19:15.228 --> 1:19:16.926
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1:19:16.969 --> 1:19:18.623
Listen to me.

1:19:18.666 --> 1:19:20.320
Christmas is about togetherness.

1:19:21.104 --> 1:19:22.148
I need you.

1:19:23.454 --> 1:19:25.456
I need you to help these men
bring out that loot.

1:19:26.631 --> 1:19:29.852
Do that, and I swear
on the baby in the manger,

1:19:29.895 --> 1:19:31.244
I will let your family go.

1:19:41.385 --> 1:19:43.561
We'’re out of here
in four minutes, Santas.

1:19:47.478 --> 1:19:48.653
You did good.

1:19:59.490 --> 1:20:01.535
[sirens wailing in distance]

1:20:13.025 --> 1:20:15.593
Stupid-ass elites think
they can hide their pearls

1:20:15.636 --> 1:20:16.986
in a closed-down bank.

1:20:18.901 --> 1:20:22.339
Yeah, this shit got to be
at least nine figures
once it'’s fenced.

1:20:22.382 --> 1:20:24.863
Money is just a way
of keeping score.

1:20:24.907 --> 1:20:27.692
We'’ll redistribute the wealth
of the world.

1:20:29.041 --> 1:20:31.827
We did it, Dajon. [laughs]

1:20:33.741 --> 1:20:34.742
Okay, I'’m done.

1:20:36.222 --> 1:20:37.963
You'’re done
when I say you'’re done.No, no, no, no.

1:20:38.007 --> 1:20:40.052
I helped you get your little
fucking war chest thing, okay--

1:20:40.096 --> 1:20:42.272
This is not a negotiation.I'’m fucking done.

1:20:42.315 --> 1:20:44.187
Get your fucking hands
off me.

1:20:44.230 --> 1:20:45.318
I have your wife.

1:20:46.276 --> 1:20:47.407
I have your daughter.

1:20:49.409 --> 1:20:50.846
You'’re one of us now.

1:20:50.889 --> 1:20:51.934
Act like it.

1:21:10.169 --> 1:21:11.779
Hey! Who are you?

1:21:11.823 --> 1:21:14.173
What the-- Oh, fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1:21:14.217 --> 1:21:15.871
What the fuck is that?
Is that a grenade?

1:21:15.914 --> 1:21:17.873
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Where
did it go? Where did it go?

1:21:34.019 --> 1:21:35.455
[grunts]

1:21:48.860 --> 1:21:50.557
Hurry the fuck up. He'’s here.

1:21:54.910 --> 1:21:56.520
Come on, go! Come on, go!

1:22:12.362 --> 1:22:14.407
[gunfire in distance]

1:22:19.847 --> 1:22:21.153
The fuck is all that?

1:22:21.197 --> 1:22:23.068
[gunfire continues]

1:22:23.112 --> 1:22:24.591
Fuck is all that?

1:22:24.635 --> 1:22:26.245
You tip '’em off?

1:22:26.289 --> 1:22:27.333
He'’s here.

1:22:30.206 --> 1:22:32.730
Where are you hiding, Detective?

1:22:32.773 --> 1:22:34.166
I can smell you.

1:22:37.387 --> 1:22:39.084
Fear everywhere, buddy.

1:22:39.128 --> 1:22:42.435
You handsome bald devil,
come out and play.

1:22:42.479 --> 1:22:43.959
[Knight] Ho, ho, ho.

1:22:49.747 --> 1:22:53.838
[laughs] Hello, Detective.

1:22:54.970 --> 1:22:57.320
Nothing better to do
on Christmas Eve?

1:22:57.363 --> 1:22:59.670
This is as good
as it gets for me.

1:22:59.713 --> 1:23:02.455
Well, with friends like us,
who needs family?

1:23:03.065 --> 1:23:04.414
[Rhodes groans]

1:23:05.589 --> 1:23:06.677
Am I right?

1:23:11.725 --> 1:23:12.900
This is how it'’s gonna go.

1:23:12.944 --> 1:23:14.424
I'’ll tell you how.

1:23:14.467 --> 1:23:17.470
I'’m gonna shove a Christmas tree
up your ass...

1:23:18.471 --> 1:23:20.125
[chuckles]
...and set it on fire.

1:23:20.169 --> 1:23:22.301
A Christmas tree up my ass?

1:23:22.345 --> 1:23:23.955
All the way.

1:23:23.999 --> 1:23:25.826
Okay, okay.

1:23:25.870 --> 1:23:27.741
You'’re even kinkier
than I thought, Detective.

1:23:27.785 --> 1:23:28.829
But I like that.

1:23:29.613 --> 1:23:30.701
No foreplay, okay?

1:23:32.311 --> 1:23:35.706
You'’re gonna make sure
we walk out of here
free and clear.

1:23:35.749 --> 1:23:38.230
[Knight] Why? Because you have
a gun to his head?

1:23:39.188 --> 1:23:40.580
The fuck do I care?

1:23:41.494 --> 1:23:42.626
Shoot him.

1:23:43.540 --> 1:23:44.715
What?

1:23:44.758 --> 1:23:46.369
You shot my partner.

1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:51.461
See what I'’m dealing with here?

1:23:51.504 --> 1:23:53.724
He sold you up the river,
Rhodes.

1:23:53.767 --> 1:23:55.334
You mean nothing to him.

1:23:55.378 --> 1:23:56.814
Less than nothing.

1:23:57.945 --> 1:23:59.512
Less than nothing. Wow.

1:23:59.556 --> 1:24:00.948
You'’re cold, Detective.

1:24:02.559 --> 1:24:03.603
Wow.

1:24:06.215 --> 1:24:09.914
Dajon, you forgot to
get me a Christmas present.

1:24:11.394 --> 1:24:14.614
I would like this motherfucker'’s
head in my stocking, please.

1:24:15.833 --> 1:24:17.443
[grunting][Conlan] Would someone
just kill him?

1:24:18.923 --> 1:24:22.187
Where is your Christmas spirit,
Detective Knight?

1:24:25.234 --> 1:24:26.539
[grunting]

1:24:31.109 --> 1:24:33.068
Dajon, quit fucking around.

1:24:34.069 --> 1:24:35.766
You let that pretty boy
kick your ass?

1:24:40.423 --> 1:24:42.860
I trained you better than that,
you little pussy.

1:24:44.992 --> 1:24:46.603
[both grunting]

1:24:47.778 --> 1:24:49.214
[henchman] I'’m coming, boss!

1:24:52.739 --> 1:24:54.611
[grunting, groaning]

1:24:57.614 --> 1:24:59.355
-[gun clicks]
-[Knight] Fuck.

1:25:00.182 --> 1:25:01.574
[Conlan] Uh-oh.

1:25:03.359 --> 1:25:05.796
[grunting, groaning]

1:25:08.146 --> 1:25:10.583
Sounds like Santa Claus didn'’t
give you enough ammunition

1:25:10.627 --> 1:25:12.063
for this party.

1:25:13.717 --> 1:25:15.501
Don'’t you worry.

1:25:15.545 --> 1:25:17.634
Father Conlan has
more than enough bullets

1:25:17.677 --> 1:25:18.722
to share with you.

1:25:19.549 --> 1:25:20.898
[laughs]

1:25:24.510 --> 1:25:25.946
You were right again, Knight.

1:25:26.904 --> 1:25:28.297
This only ends
with one of us dead.

1:25:31.474 --> 1:25:33.171
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

1:25:34.172 --> 1:25:35.869
[grunts]

1:25:36.392 --> 1:25:39.003
[panting]

1:25:43.225 --> 1:25:45.836
[groaning]

1:25:51.755 --> 1:25:53.365
How you doing, brother?

1:25:53.409 --> 1:25:55.106
[grunting, groaning]

1:26:03.549 --> 1:26:05.986
You f-- Oh.

1:26:09.642 --> 1:26:10.730
[Conlan] Wow.

1:26:12.297 --> 1:26:14.299
Didn'’t see that coming.

1:26:14.343 --> 1:26:16.083
[laughs]

1:26:32.926 --> 1:26:34.058
Are we good?

1:26:34.101 --> 1:26:36.016
I mean, not, you know,
good good.

1:26:36.060 --> 1:26:39.019
But good enough?

1:26:39.063 --> 1:26:42.675
I'’m gonna give you five seconds
before I lube up my gun.

1:26:43.633 --> 1:26:45.112
What the fuck does that mean?

1:26:45.156 --> 1:26:47.202
Well, I guess you'’re gonna
find out in four.

1:26:47.985 --> 1:26:49.334
One.

1:26:50.205 --> 1:26:51.293
Two.

1:26:52.207 --> 1:26:53.208
Three.

1:27:04.610 --> 1:27:06.090
[crying] It'’s gonna be okay.

1:27:07.613 --> 1:27:09.093
[sirens wailing]

1:27:10.747 --> 1:27:11.922
Mom!

1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:20.626
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:27:25.065 --> 1:27:29.287
[chuckling] It'’s gonna
be okay. It'’s okay.

1:27:29.331 --> 1:27:31.376
[sobbing] Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1:27:31.420 --> 1:27:32.856
Thank you, thank you.

1:27:32.899 --> 1:27:34.292
[Vassetti] Arthur!

1:27:35.293 --> 1:27:36.990
Arthur, where are you?

1:27:37.034 --> 1:27:39.297
[police officer] Freeze! NYPD!

1:27:39.341 --> 1:27:41.473
Put it down! Hands
where we can see them.

1:27:41.517 --> 1:27:42.692
I'’m looking for my son.

1:27:43.649 --> 1:27:44.868
Arthur Vassetti.

1:27:46.391 --> 1:27:48.437
Please, help me find my son.

1:27:52.092 --> 1:27:53.137
Where is my son?

1:27:54.181 --> 1:27:55.879
My son'’s name
is Arthur Vassetti.

1:27:57.010 --> 1:27:59.361
Ricky Conlan took my son!

1:27:59.404 --> 1:28:02.755
[reporter] Did Conlan meet
your son at church?Where'’s my son, Arthur?

1:28:02.799 --> 1:28:05.062
[reporter] How long were
you working for Conlan?

1:28:05.105 --> 1:28:07.804
[crowd chanting] Lock him up!
Lock him up!

1:28:07.847 --> 1:28:09.806
Ricky Conlan has my son.

1:28:11.198 --> 1:28:12.548
Find my son!

1:28:20.991 --> 1:28:22.427
[no audible dialogue]

1:28:49.628 --> 1:28:51.717
You'’re the gift that keeps
on giving.

1:28:57.070 --> 1:28:58.115
You win.

1:28:59.421 --> 1:29:01.118
[laughing]

1:29:04.469 --> 1:29:06.776
Don'’t let them put me in a cage.

1:29:08.821 --> 1:29:10.388
I'’m not going back.

1:29:12.042 --> 1:29:13.130
Kill me.

1:29:13.957 --> 1:29:16.133
[panting] Do it.

1:29:27.666 --> 1:29:29.407
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

1:29:29.451 --> 1:29:30.800
[voices chant] Ho!

1:31:25.392 --> 1:31:28.395
[court official]
The State calls to the stand
Detective Fitzgerald.

1:31:34.576 --> 1:31:37.056
[Mason] Good to see you
on your feet again, Fitz.

1:31:37.100 --> 1:31:39.624
Anything to make you happy,
Mason.

1:31:39.668 --> 1:31:41.278
How about you save us all
a bunch of time

1:31:41.321 --> 1:31:43.193
and tell us the real truth
about your partner?

1:31:44.542 --> 1:31:46.152
Oh, where do I begin?

1:31:46.196 --> 1:31:47.893
Knight was cleared
for the extraordinary events

1:31:47.937 --> 1:31:50.069
in New York City
and the prosecutor lacks

1:31:50.113 --> 1:31:52.158
the evidence he needs
to charge him for the murder

1:31:52.202 --> 1:31:54.683
of one Jerry Leach
which, ipso facto,

1:31:54.726 --> 1:31:56.859
does not make that guy innocent.

1:31:56.902 --> 1:31:58.295
[Fitzgerald] Ipso facto?

1:31:58.338 --> 1:31:59.775
Who gives a fuck?

1:32:00.776 --> 1:32:03.343
No one'’s crying for Jerry Leach.

1:32:03.387 --> 1:32:07.173
The man was a convicted murderer
who got off on a technicality.

1:32:08.087 --> 1:32:09.611
If Knight killed him,

1:32:09.654 --> 1:32:12.570
it was only to stop him
before he hurt someone else.

1:32:12.614 --> 1:32:15.225
Detective,
is the world a safer place

1:32:15.268 --> 1:32:17.357
with Knight behind bars
or behind a badge?

1:32:17.401 --> 1:32:20.360
Honestly, where do I begin?

1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:25.931
He'’s moody, disorganized,
he drives fast,

1:32:25.975 --> 1:32:27.280
talks shit all day.

1:32:27.324 --> 1:32:28.891
He'’s a workaholic.

1:32:28.934 --> 1:32:31.458
I once caught him teaching
my eldest son

1:32:31.502 --> 1:32:34.200
to do e-brake turns
in a parking lot.

1:32:34.244 --> 1:32:37.726
Okay, my son Sam is nine.
Nine years old.

1:32:37.769 --> 1:32:41.468
And he didn'’t think that
he was doing anything wrong.

1:32:41.512 --> 1:32:45.211
He has yet to pick up a check,
not once in the eight years

1:32:45.255 --> 1:32:47.126
that we'’ve been partners.

1:32:47.170 --> 1:32:51.304
Let'’s just say
this guy is an asshole.

1:32:52.436 --> 1:32:54.264
But it'’s not his job
to be liked.

1:32:55.657 --> 1:32:58.834
This man has more experience
than the rest of the guys

1:32:58.877 --> 1:33:01.314
in the department combined.

1:33:01.358 --> 1:33:04.622
He'’s the first man on the
scene. He'’s the first man
through the door.

1:33:04.666 --> 1:33:07.016
This guy is a cop.

1:33:09.627 --> 1:33:11.020
And we are all much safer

1:33:12.195 --> 1:33:14.066
with James Knight
behind the badge.

1:33:15.764 --> 1:33:17.983
[department representative]
After hearing
two dozen testimonies

1:33:18.027 --> 1:33:19.985
assessing victim
impact statements

1:33:20.029 --> 1:33:23.119
and his past cases,
the department recommends that

1:33:23.162 --> 1:33:26.513
James Knight be reinstated
effective immediately.

1:33:27.514 --> 1:33:29.386
Congratulations, Detective.
