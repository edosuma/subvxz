09:20.386 --> 09:22.857
Exactly. No problem.

09:22.857 --> 09:25.162
Even you don't
believe that, Riggs.

09:25.162 --> 09:27.166
I can tell by
your body language.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.402
My body language?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.139
Yes.

09:30.139 --> 09:31.842
I am that good.

09:31.842 --> 09:33.679
Now, vacate the premises.

09:33.679 --> 09:34.914
Okay.

09:34.914 --> 09:36.184
Fine.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.624
Up top? No? Okay.

09:45.369 --> 09:47.407
What you looking at?

09:47.407 --> 09:50.312
I'm trying to find Murtaugh
an apartment.

09:50.312 --> 09:52.216
Unless you want him to crash
with you for a couple nights.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.754
Oh, yeah, no, that's
never gonna happen.

09:54.754 --> 09:56.324
Come on, Bailey, we gotta
work together on this.
I am.

09:56.324 --> 09:59.297
Which is why I found
the inspector

09:59.297 --> 10:01.268
for our DOA's construction site.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.439
Gary Filmore.
He got a record?

10:03.439 --> 10:06.278
His greatest hits‐‐ assault,
a little extortion,

10:06.278 --> 10:09.250
and he's licensed
in heavy machinery.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.486
His current job site.

10:10.486 --> 10:12.957
Text me this address.

10:12.957 --> 10:14.427
All right, last chance.
Sure you don't want to have

10:14.427 --> 10:15.963
a slumber party
with your mentor?

10:15.963 --> 10:17.400
Try Scorsese.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.869
Thanks a lot, Bailey.

10:26.151 --> 10:28.288
MURTAUGH:
"Butler's."

10:28.288 --> 10:31.026
A butler?

10:31.026 --> 10:33.332
Comes in, cleans up,
cooks all of our food.

10:33.332 --> 10:36.171
I love it.
Hire a butler.
No, no, no, no.

10:36.171 --> 10:37.840
Butler's Greens
and Groceries.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.377
Why do I know that name?

10:39.377 --> 10:41.948
I don't know, they're
all over Texas.
Hmm.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.086
Gary?

10:45.356 --> 10:47.193
Gary Filmore,
is that you?

10:47.193 --> 10:48.896
How do I know you?
RIGGS: No.

10:48.896 --> 10:52.135
But, you know,
sometimes a stranger

10:52.135 --> 10:54.207
is just a friend
you haven't met.
And sometimes

10:54.207 --> 10:55.342
he's just a cop.
Yeah.

10:55.342 --> 10:57.480
So, we're here
to talk to you

10:57.480 --> 11:00.118
about why you drove
a forklift through Sam Higgins

11:00.118 --> 11:01.388
after you extorted him.

11:05.462 --> 11:08.167
(sighs) Now I'm just
down to two shirts.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.537
Y'all get out of here.

11:09.537 --> 11:11.341
What the... ?

11:11.341 --> 11:12.844
(crowd exclaiming)

11:12.844 --> 11:15.081
Hey, hey! What's up, Gary?

11:15.081 --> 11:16.384
Calm down, calm down.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.288
We just want to talk.

11:18.288 --> 11:20.392
(grunting)
(crowd gasping)

11:20.392 --> 11:22.530
Well, a little too late
for that.

11:22.530 --> 11:25.101
(both grunting)

11:26.371 --> 11:27.607
Trish?

11:27.607 --> 11:29.510
What are you doing here?

11:29.510 --> 11:31.514
Uh, a little thing
we like to call

11:31.514 --> 11:33.418
"Keeping America
safe again."

11:33.418 --> 11:35.356
No. No, what you're doing
is ruining

11:35.356 --> 11:37.092
my groundbreaking, Roger.

11:37.092 --> 11:38.595
Your gr‐groundbreaking
for what?

11:38.595 --> 11:40.432
The deal I've been
working on for six months.

11:40.432 --> 11:41.635
Butler!

11:41.635 --> 11:43.372
But‐‐ th‐‐ I knew it.

11:43.372 --> 11:45.576
Didn't I just say,
"I know that name"?

11:45.576 --> 11:47.446
I don't remember
you saying that.
Remember, I was over there.

11:47.446 --> 11:48.982
You know what you
could do, though.
What?

11:48.982 --> 11:50.486
You could apologize
to your wife. I think this is

11:50.486 --> 11:51.988
a perfect opportunity...
I've done nothing wrong.

11:51.988 --> 11:53.458
What do you mean
you've done nothing wrong?

11:53.458 --> 11:54.661
You're living at my place,
and you can't...

11:54.661 --> 11:56.331
What is going on here?

11:56.331 --> 11:59.136
It's almost time
to implode the building.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.439
No, we're fine, Guillermo.

12:00.439 --> 12:01.474
My husband and his partner

12:01.474 --> 12:03.879
were just doing a
last‐minute security check,

12:03.879 --> 12:06.150
and, uh, they're about to leave.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.218
Yes. Right.
Yeah.

12:07.218 --> 12:08.220
You remember my boss.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.058
Absolutely.

12:10.058 --> 12:12.263
I hear Trish talk
about you all the time.

12:12.263 --> 12:13.498
Welcome back.
Thank you.

12:13.498 --> 12:14.567
Just flew in from Dubai

12:14.567 --> 12:16.003
to press the button.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.440
It's like a bucket list thing.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.243
(chuckles)
And this is Henry Butler.

12:19.243 --> 12:21.080
The grocery man. Hey.
It's a pleasure.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.950
The man, the myth,
the legend, yes, sir.
(laughs)

12:22.950 --> 12:24.186
I love your cantaloupes.

12:24.186 --> 12:25.422
This man okay, here?

12:25.422 --> 12:26.658
Oh, yeah, he's just a murderer.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.160
Come on.
Alleged murderer.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.464
(grunting)
We're gonna...

12:29.464 --> 12:30.933
Yeah, we're gonna
get‐‐ hey. Hey!

12:30.933 --> 12:32.168
Hey! Hey!
Why are you being
so difficult?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.338
Hey!
(overlapping chatter)

12:34.507 --> 12:35.476
(shouts)

12:40.051 --> 12:42.356
(people exclaiming)

12:49.637 --> 12:51.641
Well... well, maybe I do
have one thing or two

12:51.641 --> 12:52.877
to apologize for.

12:58.388 --> 13:00.191
So let me get this straight.

13:00.191 --> 13:01.928
Your story is that you...
TRISH:
Roger Mayfield Murtaugh!

13:01.928 --> 13:07.138
The man flew 8,000 miles
just to push the button.

13:07.138 --> 13:08.408
Your story's that
you threatened Sam,

13:08.408 --> 13:10.379
but you didn't
kill him?
Yeah.

13:10.379 --> 13:12.182
TRISH: This is unfixable. Are
you gonna find another building

13:12.182 --> 13:13.518
for him to blow up, huh?
Excuse me.

13:13.518 --> 13:14.654
You are unbelievable!

13:14.654 --> 13:16.324
Yes, you!

13:16.324 --> 13:18.127
You are unbelievable!
Can we lower the volume?

13:18.127 --> 13:19.697
This is my place of business.

13:19.697 --> 13:23.237
I'm sorry, am I disrupting
your place of business?

13:23.237 --> 13:25.041
Okay. Trish has a point.

13:25.041 --> 13:27.212
I've experienced your
tone‐deafness often.

13:27.212 --> 13:29.951
But in all fairness, Trish,
interrupting your event

13:29.951 --> 13:31.721
was an accident.
Exactly.

13:31.721 --> 13:34.126
Now, can we agree it was
a successful groundbreaking?

13:34.126 --> 13:35.996
Ground was broken.

13:35.996 --> 13:37.533
All that was lost
was a photo op.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.002
All?

13:39.002 --> 13:41.073
Butler pulled out of the deal.

13:41.073 --> 13:43.043
You are unbelievable.
This is still payback

13:43.043 --> 13:44.146
for the motorcycle.
No.

13:44.146 --> 13:45.382
Really?
This was an accident.

13:45.382 --> 13:47.051
An accident.
Yeah.

13:47.051 --> 13:48.989
But if you want to talk
about the motorcycle

13:48.989 --> 13:51.126
that you ran over,
unapologetically...
(mouths)

13:51.126 --> 13:53.097
No. No, stop.
You're embarrassing yourself.

13:53.097 --> 13:55.402
It's what I do.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.738
Listen. How about
I talk to Butler?

13:56.738 --> 13:58.007
He's still in the building.

13:58.007 --> 13:59.242
(gasps)

13:59.242 --> 14:01.146
What? He's here?

14:01.146 --> 14:03.418
Shenanigan central?
Uh‐‐ why?

14:03.418 --> 14:05.422
Our homicide vic
was Butler's contract.

14:05.422 --> 14:06.658
AVERY:
It's protocol.

14:06.658 --> 14:08.027
Don't worry, he's in good hands.

14:10.064 --> 14:12.302
Whose hands?

14:12.302 --> 14:14.373
(laughter)

14:14.373 --> 14:16.143
All right, I got one
for you, lunatic.

14:16.143 --> 14:18.682
How is a Longhorn like a possum?
Mm.

14:18.682 --> 14:20.385
Both play dead at home
and die on the road.

14:20.385 --> 14:22.389
RIGGS: All right, all right,
how about what do you get

14:22.389 --> 14:24.125
when you cross a
groundhog and an Aggie?
BUTLER: I'll bite.

14:24.125 --> 14:26.296
Six more weeks of bad football.
(laughter)

14:26.296 --> 14:28.234
Okay, what's happening?

14:28.234 --> 14:30.472
He's not driving you insane?

14:30.472 --> 14:33.010
Actually, he's being
very hospitable.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.780
RIGGS: Mm.
For a Longhorn.

14:34.780 --> 14:37.151
Riggs? Hospitable?
Well, it‐it's really pity,

14:37.151 --> 14:39.089
you know,
disguised as hospitality.

14:39.089 --> 14:41.059
I mean, it's not his fault
that his defense is terrible.

14:41.059 --> 14:42.095
BUTLER:
You see that?

14:42.095 --> 14:43.364
Now, he's the first real guy

14:43.364 --> 14:44.767
I've met in this city.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.236
Actually making me
a tad bit homesick.

14:46.236 --> 14:48.140
He has that gift.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.111
Which is why I need to ask
for my blueprints back.

14:50.111 --> 14:51.581
I got to head on
back to Austin.
Oh, no, no.

14:51.581 --> 14:53.685
Mr. Butler, there's
no better place than here

14:53.685 --> 14:55.756
for a flagship Butler's.

14:55.756 --> 14:57.191
Please don't
pull out of the deal.

14:57.191 --> 14:59.362
Look, Trish, I
understand your passion,

14:59.362 --> 15:01.066
and I appreciate
that, darling,

15:01.066 --> 15:02.569
but you know,
the juju just isn't right.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.039
My contractor
was killed.

15:04.039 --> 15:05.709
Yeah, but, uh, LAPD

15:05.709 --> 15:08.314
has the killer in custody‐‐
in record time, I might add.

15:08.314 --> 15:10.485
Actually, we don't.
Gary's alibi checks out.

15:10.485 --> 15:11.788
He's being
released now.

15:11.788 --> 15:13.491
Uh, yeah, i‐it's not
just my contractor.

15:13.491 --> 15:15.127
You know, I've been getting

15:15.127 --> 15:16.431
threatening phone calls
from a competitor...

15:16.431 --> 15:18.200
Who? Who?
...bidding on the property...

15:18.200 --> 15:20.071
Uh, I don't know,
something or other‐‐ Ortega?

15:20.071 --> 15:22.041
And besides, I need
to be in a city

15:22.041 --> 15:23.344
where I can get
a good Texas meal.

15:23.344 --> 15:24.680
You know exactly
what I'm talking about,

15:24.680 --> 15:26.116
don't you, partner?

15:26.116 --> 15:28.387
RIGGS: Hey, Mr. Butler.
(clears throat)

15:28.387 --> 15:29.623
The best Texas barbecue
I've ever had

15:29.623 --> 15:30.992
is right here in Los Angeles.

15:31.828 --> 15:33.397
(Southern accent):
Well, thank you.

15:33.397 --> 15:34.633
Shut up, not you.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.471
I don't believe you, son.

15:36.471 --> 15:37.840
Well, stick around for a night,

15:37.840 --> 15:39.710
give Trish here
another opportunity,

15:39.710 --> 15:41.113
I'll serve it up myself,
make a believer out of you.

15:43.183 --> 15:45.856
I'll tell you what,
I'll call my wife,

15:45.856 --> 15:47.392
tell her I'm
running late.

15:47.392 --> 15:51.099
You're on, buddy.

15:51.099 --> 15:53.103
(Trish exhales)

15:53.103 --> 15:55.141
That was amazing.

15:55.141 --> 15:56.577
Are you sure about
this barbecue?

15:56.577 --> 15:57.813
Hundred percent.

15:57.813 --> 15:59.416
It's Molly's.

16:01.119 --> 16:02.689
I‐I thought he wasn't
seeing Molly.

16:02.689 --> 16:04.392
He's not.

16:07.265 --> 16:09.537
This needs to work.
It's gonna work.

16:13.110 --> 16:15.281
MOLLY: Brisket platter
with beans and greens?

16:15.281 --> 16:16.551
Yeah, yeah.
Right here.

16:16.551 --> 16:18.488
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.

16:18.488 --> 16:19.857
RIGGS:
Uh‐‐ excuse‐‐ oh, excuse me...

16:19.857 --> 16:21.861
Here's your change.
Have a great day.

16:21.861 --> 16:23.865
Aw, thank you. Next.

16:23.865 --> 16:25.802
Hey! Well, good golly,
Miss Molly!

16:27.606 --> 16:29.108
(exhales)

16:29.108 --> 16:31.112
What can I get you?

16:31.112 --> 16:32.683
Probably get that a lot.
Hey, this is great, though.

16:32.683 --> 16:35.856
Right? Congratulations.

16:35.856 --> 16:37.458
Oh, I also, uh, brought
some of your...

16:37.458 --> 16:39.128
some of your items
from the house.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.266
Didn't know if maybe
you'd have a break,

16:41.266 --> 16:42.769
and maybe we could talk?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.773
There's a long line behind you.

16:44.773 --> 16:46.443
What would you
like, sir?
Two meat combo,

16:46.443 --> 16:47.679
ribs and brisket.

16:47.679 --> 16:49.182
You got it.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.619
I mean, we're good, right?

16:50.619 --> 16:53.190
We don't need to talk
about everything.

16:53.190 --> 16:54.459
We've known each other forever.

16:54.459 --> 16:55.829
I mean, we're‐we're
floaters, right?

16:55.829 --> 16:57.298
We‐we float in and out
of each other's lives.

16:57.298 --> 16:58.635
Riggs, leave my stuff
and float away.

16:58.635 --> 16:59.937
I'm running a business.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.406
Well, that's actually
why I'm here.

17:01.406 --> 17:03.176
I have a business opportunity
for you.

17:03.176 --> 17:05.147
Not interested.
You know the, uh,

17:05.147 --> 17:07.251
Butler grocery stores
in Texas?

17:07.251 --> 17:09.122
The owner wants to try
your barbecue.

17:09.122 --> 17:11.326
Butler? You know Henry Butler?

17:11.326 --> 17:13.698
Having dinner
with him tonight.

17:13.698 --> 17:15.467
And I promised him that you
would cook for him‐‐ hey!

17:15.467 --> 17:16.837
Little something
for the tip jar, bud.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.144
Yeah. That's how
you say thank you.

17:20.144 --> 17:22.448
So what do you say?
Murtaugh's, 7:00 tonight.

17:22.448 --> 17:24.385
Come on, Molly,
your‐your seasonings

17:24.385 --> 17:26.222
could be in every grocery store
across the country.

17:29.195 --> 17:30.331
Okay, if I do this...

17:30.331 --> 17:32.603
(groans)
What the hell is wrong with me?

17:32.603 --> 17:34.773
I would not be doing it
as a favor for you.

17:34.773 --> 17:36.777
No. Beautiful.

17:36.777 --> 17:39.315
Riggs. Can you...

17:39.315 --> 17:41.186
(grunts)
See you tonight.

17:46.196 --> 17:48.367
Okay, Bailey checked
the phone records.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.272
The Ortega brothers
definitely called Butler.

17:51.272 --> 17:52.541
They must be
the threatening phone calls

17:52.541 --> 17:53.978
he was talking about.

17:53.978 --> 17:57.284
So I've got 5:05.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.755
Why do you keep doing that?
You're making me nervous.

17:58.755 --> 18:00.892
Because tonight has
to go perfectly.

18:00.892 --> 18:02.194
Okay? We need
to finish up here,

18:02.194 --> 18:03.865
get back to your place,
shower, change

18:03.865 --> 18:05.902
and get to that dinner.

18:05.902 --> 18:08.206
Just relax. Everything's
gonna be fine.
You‐you listen to me.

18:08.206 --> 18:09.877
I've never been more serious.

18:09.877 --> 18:11.914
I need to get back to my house.

18:11.914 --> 18:13.550
If this goes
south tonight,

18:13.550 --> 18:16.589
I may be living
with you forever.

18:16.589 --> 18:18.260
What time is it right now?

18:18.260 --> 18:19.763
5:06.

18:19.763 --> 18:21.132
Let's go.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.441
(speaking Spanish)

18:25.441 --> 18:27.378
(muffled screaming)

18:32.723 --> 18:34.292
Miguel.

18:34.292 --> 18:35.461
(speaks Spanish)

18:37.799 --> 18:39.268
(whistles)

18:39.268 --> 18:40.137
You smell that?
Hmm?

18:40.137 --> 18:41.807
I love the smell
of fuel and motor oil.

18:41.807 --> 18:43.276
It reminds me of home.

18:43.276 --> 18:44.947
It sure does.
Hmm.

18:44.947 --> 18:46.449
Hey, boys!

18:46.449 --> 18:48.286
Officers, can we help you?

18:48.286 --> 18:49.589
I'm glad you asked.

18:49.589 --> 18:51.927
I'd like to know why
you drilled a forklift

18:51.927 --> 18:53.330
through a contractor
named Sam Higgins.

18:53.330 --> 18:54.632
RIGGS: And
make it quick,

18:54.632 --> 18:55.969
we're, uh, on the clock.
Yeah.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.672
(speaks in Spanish)
We're, uh...

18:57.672 --> 18:59.710
You see, it was a big
hole through the guy.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.279
I mean,
the dude was a snake.

19:01.279 --> 19:03.316
He tipped us off to a spot

19:03.316 --> 19:05.254
for a new warehouse, but he
sold us out to some cowboy.

19:05.254 --> 19:06.556
Henry Butler?

19:08.293 --> 19:09.797
So, let me get this straight,
you guys killed Sam,

19:09.797 --> 19:11.299
and then, what, you just
threatened Mr. Butler?

19:11.299 --> 19:12.903
Is that right?
Wait, no, no, listen.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.338
We didn't kill nobody.
I mean, it wasn't worth it.

19:14.338 --> 19:15.307
We bought
another spot.

19:16.944 --> 19:18.781
RIGGS:
I believe him.

19:18.781 --> 19:21.286
You?
He's got sincere eyes.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.989
Have a good day, gentlemen.
Yep.

19:22.989 --> 19:24.525
(rapping in car trunk)

19:24.525 --> 19:25.795
(muffled screaming)

19:25.795 --> 19:27.631
(groans)
(sighs)

19:29.302 --> 19:31.272
The jack must be faulty.

19:31.272 --> 19:32.876
The jack must be faulty.

19:32.876 --> 19:35.314
Faulty jacks.
Faulty ja‐‐ happens
all the time.

19:35.314 --> 19:36.951
Yeah, let's take
a look at that.
Yep.

19:36.951 --> 19:38.653
Here we go.

19:38.653 --> 19:39.957
(muffled grunting)

19:39.957 --> 19:41.392
We're gonna be late.
Yeah.

20:14.927 --> 20:16.797
You need to shower.

20:24.478 --> 20:26.015
(doorbell rings)

20:26.015 --> 20:28.119
I don't know why you took
so long to get ready.

20:28.119 --> 20:30.657
It's ridiculous.
Well, some of us actually
care how we look.

20:30.657 --> 20:31.894
What the hell's that supp‐‐
what are you looking at?

20:31.894 --> 20:33.129
What does that mean?

20:33.129 --> 20:34.565
(quietly):
You're late.
Hi.

20:34.565 --> 20:36.602
Get in here.
It's his fault.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.874
Yeah, well, you know what?
We're here.

20:38.874 --> 20:40.878
I'm just gonna
run this right upstairs.
It's fine in the foyer for now.

20:40.878 --> 20:43.016
Yeah, but don't you
want to have...

20:43.016 --> 20:44.685
It's fine in the
foyer for now.
You know what I'm gonna do?

20:44.685 --> 20:46.489
I'm gonna go make sure
Molly doesn't need...

20:46.489 --> 20:47.926
Nope. She said she
doesn't want you to.

20:47.926 --> 20:50.030
She specifically told me
to tell you that.

20:50.030 --> 20:52.668
Classic Molly. That's how
we talk to each other. She...

20:52.668 --> 20:54.940
Okay, you guys,
this is not about you,

20:54.940 --> 20:56.542
and it's not about you.

20:56.542 --> 20:58.446
Yes, ma'am.
Butler is in
the other room,

20:58.446 --> 21:01.219
and he is ready to leave on a
plane for Texas at any moment.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.554
That's 'cause he hasn't
tried the barbecue.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.058
Once he tries that
barbecue, it...

21:04.058 --> 21:06.129
And a mystery guest, my boss,
who has no idea

21:06.129 --> 21:09.001
that Butler wants to pull out
of the deal, decided to show up.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.506
So I have one night
to sell Butler

21:11.506 --> 21:13.743
without alarming Azoulay.

21:13.743 --> 21:16.682
So there will be
zero shenanigans.

21:18.553 --> 21:20.724
Say it.

21:20.724 --> 21:22.394
There will... no shenanigans.

21:23.630 --> 21:24.866
Say it.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.135
Z‐Zero shenanigans.

21:26.135 --> 21:28.139
That's right.

21:30.444 --> 21:32.648
That bag better go upstairs.

21:32.648 --> 21:33.984
It'll be upstairs.

21:33.984 --> 21:36.089
Zero shenanigans.
You're the one.

21:36.089 --> 21:37.157
You're the one
that has all the...
You're Mr. Shenanigans.

21:37.157 --> 21:38.894
(insects trilling)

21:42.000 --> 21:45.707
They really love the, uh,
little barbecue sausage things.

21:45.707 --> 21:47.211
(sighs)
Didn't Trish tell you

21:47.211 --> 21:50.050
I specifically do not
want your help?
She did.

21:50.050 --> 21:52.187
But I think what she meant
to say was that...

21:52.187 --> 21:54.158
I meant I do not
want you out here.

21:54.158 --> 21:57.798
...that since I kind of left
abruptly without an explanation

21:57.798 --> 21:59.735
that maybe an
apology was in order.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.506
(laughs)
What? No.

22:01.506 --> 22:02.842
That is not what I want.

22:02.842 --> 22:04.078
And even if I did,
I don't want it now,

22:04.078 --> 22:05.147
when I am in the middle
of cooking

22:05.147 --> 22:06.582
a potentially
career‐making meal.

22:06.582 --> 22:07.852
Molly, hold
on. Just...

22:07.852 --> 22:09.522
I...
No, you hold on.

22:09.522 --> 22:10.858
You disappeared.

22:10.858 --> 22:12.528
And now you just want
to pop back in

22:12.528 --> 22:15.534
and explain yourself
on your schedule.
No.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.604
Listen, Molly, I...
No, you just listen.

22:17.604 --> 22:21.012
We've known each other
for over 20 years.

22:21.012 --> 22:22.514
But you hurt me.

22:22.514 --> 22:24.185
Molly...
And I don't want
to keep doing this,

22:24.185 --> 22:26.055
pretending we're friends
and‐and you're acting

22:26.055 --> 22:27.724
like you're helping me...
Molly.

22:27.724 --> 22:29.795
...with some job.
I mean, what is...
Molly.

22:29.795 --> 22:31.766
Molly. Molly!
What is this we're even doing?
What, Riggs?!

22:31.766 --> 22:33.136
What is it that you just can't
keep yourself from saying?!

22:33.136 --> 22:34.772
Ribs.

22:36.576 --> 22:38.546
(sighs)
They're ruined.

22:38.546 --> 22:39.983
I ruined them.
W...

22:39.983 --> 22:41.252
I've got chicken in the fryer.

22:41.252 --> 22:42.654
Now I've got to prep new ribs.

22:42.654 --> 22:43.924
(clears throat)

22:43.924 --> 22:45.794
You're a
landmine, Riggs.

22:45.794 --> 22:47.966
This is probably why
Trish wanted me to...

22:47.966 --> 22:50.203
You are gonna go in there,
stand by that fryer,

22:50.203 --> 22:52.741
and watch. When that
chicken is gold,

22:52.741 --> 22:54.111
take it out.
You think you can handle that?

22:58.586 --> 23:00.257
Well, so far, can I just say,

23:00.257 --> 23:03.529
barbecue expectations
have been exceeded.

23:03.529 --> 23:05.533
(chuckles)
AZOULAY: Trish Murtaugh
will never let you down.

23:05.533 --> 23:07.070
She goes all out,

23:07.070 --> 23:08.539
even when she's not

23:08.539 --> 23:11.045
trying to sell you
something.
How do you mean?

23:11.045 --> 23:13.283
You're doing that very thing
this very moment.

23:13.283 --> 23:15.553
Uh, more wine, Mr. Butler?

23:15.553 --> 23:16.990
Why would we be trying
to sell you

23:16.990 --> 23:18.726
on a deal that's
already closed?

23:18.726 --> 23:20.463
(under her breath):
No, no, no, don't say anything.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.204
Oh, I wonder
where that chicken is.

23:29.848 --> 23:31.786
(phone ringing)

23:34.091 --> 23:35.860
Yeah.

23:35.860 --> 23:38.333
The Ortegas were with their PO
at the time of the murder.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.303
They're drug dealers,
but they didn't kill Sam.

23:40.303 --> 23:42.574
However, I thought it was odd
that they were willing

23:42.574 --> 23:43.977
to overpay for the lot
where Butler was building

23:43.977 --> 23:45.280
his grocery stores.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.882
And?
I got them to spill.

23:46.882 --> 23:50.056
The lot sits
over an abandoned subway tunnel.

23:50.056 --> 23:52.260
Perfect for cooking,
storing and moving drugs.

23:52.260 --> 23:54.365
That's perfect
for a drug dealer, but...

23:54.365 --> 23:56.602
why's Butler willing to overpay?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.306
Bailey, pull those blueprints
for me.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.310
I already tried.
But Butler pulled some strings

24:00.310 --> 24:01.779
and got them back
from the evidence room.

24:05.086 --> 24:07.524
(phone chimes)

24:09.595 --> 24:10.864
Update on the ribs.

24:10.864 --> 24:12.868
They will be here imminently.

24:12.868 --> 24:16.675
Apparently, they're being given
a little extra love. (chuckles)

24:19.581 --> 24:21.252
Now, where was I?

24:21.252 --> 24:23.289
Uh, gentlemen,

24:23.289 --> 24:25.660
can we not agree

24:25.660 --> 24:28.299
that there's value
to selling even after

24:28.299 --> 24:30.904
the original deal
has been struck?

24:30.904 --> 24:33.009
Take marriage, for example.

24:33.009 --> 24:35.079
Shouldn't a spouse

24:35.079 --> 24:38.252
have to prove his love

24:38.252 --> 24:40.256
to his wife every day?

24:40.256 --> 24:41.759
And shouldn't he want to?

24:41.759 --> 24:43.029
Trish.
Hmm?

24:43.029 --> 24:44.264
What is your Longhorn friend

24:44.264 --> 24:45.333
doing with my blueprints?

24:45.333 --> 24:46.936
(laughs)

24:46.936 --> 24:48.906
Roger. Roger's gonna find out.

24:52.948 --> 24:55.019
(chuckles)

24:55.019 --> 24:59.261
Uh, he's... he's so good with...

25:02.167 --> 25:05.240
Riggs, this is
coming very close

25:05.240 --> 25:07.611
to being categorized
as a shenanigan.

25:07.611 --> 25:09.081
We need to give
these plans back.

25:09.081 --> 25:10.316
Look, why was Butler
willing to pay extra

25:10.316 --> 25:11.752
to build over these
abandoned tunnels?

25:11.752 --> 25:13.656
Because my beautiful wife,

25:13.656 --> 25:16.028
who's on the verge of letting me
back in my house,

25:16.028 --> 25:17.697
is a great negotiator.

25:17.697 --> 25:19.701
Or he's up to something.

25:19.701 --> 25:21.639
Or both are true, all right?

25:21.639 --> 25:23.209
But why does he want
these plans back so bad?

25:23.209 --> 25:25.246
Because he paid for them,
just like I paid for my sins

25:25.246 --> 25:29.221
with Trish by staying
in your clammy, little trailer.

25:29.221 --> 25:30.957
(coughs)
Where is the vent?

25:30.957 --> 25:32.394
Right here.
There's a massive

25:32.394 --> 25:34.398
ventilation system
running through the basement.

25:34.398 --> 25:37.404
No, the truck, not the...
(stammers)

25:37.404 --> 25:39.741
It's a supermarket.
Please, focus.

25:39.741 --> 25:41.245
See, this is what happens

25:41.245 --> 25:42.747
when people spend too
much time together.

25:42.747 --> 25:44.918
You start not knowing
what the words are.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.455
I don't know what
you're saying.

25:46.455 --> 25:48.392
What if that's why Butler's
venting the tunnels?

25:48.392 --> 25:49.761
Underground meth lab.

25:49.761 --> 25:51.098
Look.

25:51.098 --> 25:52.701
What is going on in here?

25:52.701 --> 25:55.940
Baby, how well
do you know Butler?

25:55.940 --> 25:58.713
No. No!
How well do you...
Hold on, Trish.

25:58.713 --> 26:00.316
No, I don't want to hold on.
(rapid beeping)

26:00.316 --> 26:02.420
Just look at the draw... Trish,
just look at the blueprint.

26:02.420 --> 26:04.124
Riggs! What's burning?

26:06.829 --> 26:09.234
(coughs)
The chicken is done.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.903
That's chicken?
I thought that was possum.

26:14.678 --> 26:16.615
Please don't
throw the chicken.

26:19.454 --> 26:23.996
So, uh, I call dibs
on the couch.

26:23.996 --> 26:25.333
What...?

26:37.257 --> 26:39.060
What are you doing?

26:39.060 --> 26:40.897
Are those the same clothes
you wore last night?

26:40.897 --> 26:44.104
(groans) Oh, now I know what it
feels like to be rock bottom.

26:44.104 --> 26:47.076
Another night
in Riggs's tin can,

26:47.076 --> 26:48.379
not even a toothbrush
to my name.

26:48.379 --> 26:49.848
That's a little
dramatic, but okay.

26:49.848 --> 26:50.983
I thought you
were back home.

26:50.983 --> 26:55.760
I was until Riggs decided
that Butler is a meth dealer.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.029
Is he?

26:57.029 --> 26:58.332
I don't know.

26:58.332 --> 26:59.868
I didn't even get a chance
to stick around

26:59.868 --> 27:02.774
because I was banished.

27:02.774 --> 27:05.980
Hey. Didn't you and Todd
just add on to your house?

27:05.980 --> 27:07.150
Right?

27:08.419 --> 27:09.988
Oh, thank God. Bailey!

27:09.988 --> 27:11.258
Urgent.

27:11.258 --> 27:12.927
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

27:12.927 --> 27:15.867
Murtaugh was just, uh,
taking me through your, uh,

27:15.867 --> 27:17.137
Butler theory.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.739
Very promising.

27:18.739 --> 27:20.008
Really? I thought
it was pretty thin.

27:20.008 --> 27:21.110
How thin is it?

27:21.110 --> 27:22.881
Skeletal. All
we know is that

27:22.881 --> 27:24.184
the property includes
old subway tunnels;

27:24.184 --> 27:26.020
other buyers
were drug dealers,

27:26.020 --> 27:27.991
and Butler's store
will have ventilation.

27:27.991 --> 27:29.895
Wow. Yeah, we're gonna have to
put some meat on those bones.

27:29.895 --> 27:32.867
Okay, so if we can prove that
Butler was cooking meth,

27:32.867 --> 27:34.538
that's motive for murder.

27:34.538 --> 27:36.542
We can solve the case and
save Murtaugh's marriage.

27:36.542 --> 27:39.181
And if we do that by midnight,
I still win.

27:39.181 --> 27:40.850
You win what?

27:40.850 --> 27:43.222
The office pool.

27:43.222 --> 27:45.359
Don't look at me.
I already lost.

27:47.029 --> 27:50.203
So Molly wasn't cool
with things after all?

27:50.203 --> 27:53.041
Well, I mean, in her defense,
I mean, I did ruin everything.

27:53.041 --> 27:55.446
You know, I mean, ruined
the ribs, burnt the chicken,

27:55.446 --> 27:56.915
almost burned down her truck.

27:56.915 --> 27:59.221
Sounds like quite the night.

27:59.221 --> 28:02.293
Well, it's classic Riggs.
(clears throat)

28:02.293 --> 28:03.863
At least you were trying.

28:03.863 --> 28:04.965
That counts for something.

28:04.965 --> 28:06.869
Does it?

28:06.869 --> 28:08.906
I think so.

28:08.906 --> 28:10.175
(groans)

28:10.175 --> 28:11.879
Clearly you don't.

28:11.879 --> 28:14.851
I just... (sighs)

28:17.257 --> 28:19.026
...I've been so selfish.

28:19.026 --> 28:20.897
You know?

28:23.802 --> 28:27.977
Doc, I think I may have ruined
something good...

28:27.977 --> 28:29.214
something real.

28:29.214 --> 28:32.353
Well, everybody makes mistakes.

28:32.353 --> 28:35.359
And everybody deserves
a second chance.

28:35.359 --> 28:38.064
You just have to figure out

28:38.064 --> 28:40.569
if that's what will
make you happy.

28:40.569 --> 28:43.943
(sighs)

28:43.943 --> 28:46.080
He's‐he's just not sure.
Man, tell him.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.583
Cap, I cracked
this case wide open.

28:47.583 --> 28:49.019
MURTAUGH:
With what?

28:49.019 --> 28:50.589
Squash.
What?

28:50.589 --> 28:51.992
It's like racquetball.
It's not like racquetball.

28:51.992 --> 28:53.462
I played in college.
It is like racquetball.

28:53.462 --> 28:55.098
The balls are more dense.
They don't bounce.

28:55.098 --> 28:57.570
It requires finesse.
Not the sport,
the vegetable.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.576
According to this manifest,
a truck of squash

29:00.576 --> 29:03.147
left Butler's El Paso store
weighing 20,000 pounds.

29:03.147 --> 29:05.553
But by the time it checked in
at the next weigh station,

29:05.553 --> 29:07.089
it weighed 15,000.

29:07.089 --> 29:08.993
So there's 5,000
pounds missing.

29:08.993 --> 29:12.165
Well, either somebody got a big
payday or a big boost in fiber.

29:12.165 --> 29:14.604
So, how do we prove
the 5,000 pounds is meth?

29:14.604 --> 29:16.875
We don't.
MURTAUGH:
Oh, great.

29:16.875 --> 29:20.148
So I guess I'll just have my
mail delivered to Riggs's now.

29:20.148 --> 29:22.152
But there may
be another way.

29:22.152 --> 29:24.189
Butler was only paying taxes
on the lighter weights

29:24.189 --> 29:25.459
that were logged in
at the station

29:25.459 --> 29:26.995
when he should've been paying

29:26.995 --> 29:28.966
on the weights
that were leaving the store.

29:28.966 --> 29:31.037
And that's fraud,
which is a good enough reason

29:31.037 --> 29:34.978
to get a search warrant
and to call Trish.

29:38.919 --> 29:40.456
<i>(cell phone ringing)</i>

29:40.456 --> 29:42.159
Come on.

29:42.159 --> 29:44.163
Now is not a good time, Roger.

29:44.163 --> 29:47.002
I am meeting Butler on his plane
to try to save this deal.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.939
Trish, do not get on that plane.
He's dirty.

29:48.939 --> 29:51.478
Why? Because the man wants
a well‐ventilated basement?

29:51.478 --> 29:53.515
You have no proof of any of it.

29:53.515 --> 29:55.185
I have squash.

29:55.185 --> 29:56.020
Well, I think
what you mean is squat,

29:56.020 --> 29:59.360
as in diddly, as in nothing.
Nothing!

29:59.360 --> 30:01.063
Listen, Trish,
there are major discrepancies

30:01.063 --> 30:03.034
in Butler's squash shipments.

30:03.034 --> 30:06.173
All that extra weight that he's
not declaring could be drugs.

30:06.173 --> 30:09.146
Or it could be kielbasa
or it could be beach balls

30:09.146 --> 30:10.616
or it could be a typo.

30:10.616 --> 30:13.121
<i>Listen, I don't have time</i>
<i>for this.</i>

30:13.121 --> 30:14.189
I have to catch Butler
before his plane takes off.

30:14.189 --> 30:15.426
I have to go. Bye.

30:15.426 --> 30:17.129
Hello?

30:19.233 --> 30:20.536
(groans)

30:20.536 --> 30:22.640
BUTLER:
This was a simple problem

30:22.640 --> 30:24.109
with a simple solution

30:24.109 --> 30:25.579
and now it's a damn mess.

30:25.579 --> 30:29.754
I ask you to take care of
someone, you do it quietly.

30:29.754 --> 30:31.725
Heavy machinery ain't quiet.

30:31.725 --> 30:34.096
Monster‐trucking a guy
with a big‐ass fork?

30:34.096 --> 30:36.000
SYKES:
Not quiet. I get it.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.204
BUTLER: Right.
SYKES: Thought I could make it
look like an accident.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.409
An accident? Well,
how'd that work out for us?

30:40.409 --> 30:43.448
What were you
thinking? Huh?

30:48.257 --> 30:50.161
Please don't be a butt dial.

30:50.161 --> 30:51.431
(whispering):
Don't be a butt dial.

30:51.431 --> 30:53.167
Hey, baby.

30:53.167 --> 30:56.608
(whispering): Roger. Hey,
you were right about Butler.

30:56.608 --> 30:58.612
You were right.
Of course I am.

30:58.612 --> 31:02.753
Look, I'm not the kind of guy
who says I told you so,

31:02.753 --> 31:04.390
but baby, I told you so.

31:04.390 --> 31:05.726
Mrs. Murtaugh.

31:05.726 --> 31:08.130
Hello? Trish?

31:08.130 --> 31:09.567
Mr. Butler,
I didn't see you there.

31:09.567 --> 31:12.138
Clearly. Plane's ready
for takeoff, Mrs. Murtaugh.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.408
Shall we?

31:13.408 --> 31:16.213
Well, listen, I just got a call

31:16.213 --> 31:18.418
that I have some business I need
to take care of this morning.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.689
How about I meet you in Austin?

31:20.689 --> 31:22.593
Yeah, you know, unfortunately,
that's not gonna work for me.

31:22.593 --> 31:24.196
I'm a very busy man.

31:24.196 --> 31:25.164
Please.

31:33.715 --> 31:35.519
You know, I got to tell you,

31:35.519 --> 31:37.556
I apologize for interrupting
your phone call.

31:37.556 --> 31:41.230
Hope it wasn't too important.

31:41.230 --> 31:43.334
Actually,
it was my husband.

31:43.334 --> 31:44.537
We were talking about you.

31:44.537 --> 31:48.144
Uh‐huh. I was afraid
that might be the case.

31:48.144 --> 31:51.685
Mr. Butler, I need to
be honest with you.

31:51.685 --> 31:53.622
You really want
to do this here?

31:53.622 --> 31:55.759
I don't think I'll have
a chance to do it again.

31:57.630 --> 32:03.475
The business you bought
was rezoned last year

32:03.475 --> 32:05.479
and you are overpaying.

32:05.479 --> 32:07.048
Now, the reason we
didn't disclose it

32:07.048 --> 32:11.056
was because it would
cost us money.

32:11.056 --> 32:16.668
Now... if you want to end it,
I'll understand.

32:18.805 --> 32:20.709
I can't believe
the last thing I said

32:20.709 --> 32:23.314
to my beautiful wife,
the mother of our children,

32:23.314 --> 32:24.751
is, "I told you so."

32:24.751 --> 32:27.088
Well, you also ruined
her grand opening.

32:27.088 --> 32:28.825
Oh, and‐and the dinner party
and you moved out.

32:28.825 --> 32:30.829
Riggs. Not helping.
Okay.

32:30.829 --> 32:34.236
Hey! Is that Butler's plane?

32:37.743 --> 32:39.212
(engines powering up)

33:02.425 --> 33:04.530
Come on.
Come on, Rog!

33:04.530 --> 33:06.266
Come on!

33:28.143 --> 33:30.248
(quietly):
Hey... no guns.

33:30.248 --> 33:32.185
What?
Yeah.

33:32.185 --> 33:33.822
A bullet could hit Trish.

33:33.822 --> 33:35.458
You don't think
I understand cabin pressure?

33:35.458 --> 33:36.895
You don't understand
brushing your teeth,

33:36.895 --> 33:38.330
you don't understand
washing your feet.
What the‐‐

33:43.875 --> 33:44.844
(shushing)

33:54.462 --> 33:56.568
I don't see her.
RIGGS: What do you mean?

33:56.568 --> 33:57.836
I thought she was meeting
Butler on the plane.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.306
(line ringing)

33:59.306 --> 34:00.876
TRISH: Hello.
Trish.

34:00.876 --> 34:02.211
Roger! Where are you?

34:02.211 --> 34:03.748
Your phone keeps going
to voice mail.

34:03.748 --> 34:05.652
I'm 39,000 feet
in the air.

34:05.652 --> 34:07.823
What?!

34:07.823 --> 34:10.461
Oh...
You're on Butler's plane?

34:10.461 --> 34:12.165
Why aren't you?

34:12.165 --> 34:14.604
Defense attorney.
I talked my way out of it.

34:14.604 --> 34:15.906
I am safely in my car.

34:15.906 --> 34:18.210
Hey, do you mind?

34:21.450 --> 34:23.354
(grunting, shouting)

34:25.792 --> 34:26.761
Roger!

34:48.370 --> 34:50.007
Don't shoot!

34:50.007 --> 34:52.345
(gunshot)
(air whooshing)

34:57.255 --> 34:59.359
(whooshing stops)

35:01.263 --> 35:02.833
(groans)
I told you no guns.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.970
Hey, that wasn't my fault.
(gun hammer clicks)

35:04.970 --> 35:06.641
Uninvited guests once again,
huh, fellas?

35:06.641 --> 35:08.310
Some welcome.

35:08.310 --> 35:10.414
You might wanna take
your finger off that trigger.

35:10.414 --> 35:11.851
Or you're gonna be
filling the next hole.

35:11.851 --> 35:13.520
Oh, I ain't dying
today, son.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.661
These are Glaser safety slugs,
designed for air marshals.

35:16.661 --> 35:19.265
What do you say we put
the weapons down, boys, huh?

35:19.265 --> 35:21.236
Slowly.

35:23.908 --> 35:25.244
Attaboy.

35:31.356 --> 35:32.893
(rattling)

35:38.872 --> 35:40.474
(alarm whooping)

36:02.084 --> 36:04.355
Oh, Riggs!

36:04.355 --> 36:06.694
It's okay, Rog.
Just relax, I got this, okay?

36:06.694 --> 36:08.263
Of course you do.
You're a SEAL.

36:08.263 --> 36:10.034
You can land this thing
in your sleep.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.536
With both hands tied
behind your back,

36:11.536 --> 36:12.906
doing one‐armed push‐ups.

36:12.906 --> 36:14.609
Ain't that right, baby‐bubba?
(nervous laugh)

36:18.584 --> 36:19.954
I think the autopilot's locked.

36:19.954 --> 36:21.590
Oh, I can't‐‐
These things are much different

36:21.590 --> 36:22.926
than my crop dusters
back in Texas, Rog.

36:27.736 --> 36:29.807
Oh, no, no, no, no!

36:33.580 --> 36:34.984
Hey. Parachute.

36:34.984 --> 36:38.590
You got another one?
There's only one.

36:38.590 --> 36:40.862
Oh, I can't go out
like this, Riggs.

36:40.862 --> 36:42.331
Sorry, Rog.
No!

36:42.331 --> 36:43.634
Aw, just kidding.

36:43.634 --> 36:44.870
Help me find something
to tether us together.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.106
Together?

36:46.106 --> 36:47.541
That chute won't hold
both of us.

36:48.845 --> 36:51.383
Hey, I'm a family man, Riggs.

36:51.383 --> 36:54.522
I have a wife, I have kids
that depend on me.

36:54.522 --> 36:56.359
You... You don't have
nothing to live for, man.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.071
Hey... what if I want that?

37:02.071 --> 37:03.607
With Molly?

37:03.607 --> 37:06.948
Yeah, I mean, you know,
maybe I want, like, a house and,

37:06.948 --> 37:09.452
you know, like,
a picket fence and...

37:09.452 --> 37:10.654
yeah, maybe with Molly.

37:10.654 --> 37:12.358
That's beautiful, Riggs.

37:12.358 --> 37:14.462
Thank you.
You deserve that.

37:14.462 --> 37:16.333
I feel like I deserve it.

37:18.905 --> 37:20.641
Rog, we're running
out of time.
Okay

Okay.

Yeah, that's it.

Go, go, go.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.357
And you be the hero?
You take that.

37:28.357 --> 37:30.594
What are you talking about?
Just put it on and go.

37:30.594 --> 37:32.064
I don't want it.
I'm not gonna take it.
I'm not gonna‐‐

37:36.106 --> 37:39.847
Okay, okay, so now
we're gonna jump out,

37:39.847 --> 37:42.718
and I'm gonna try to catch
the parachute in midair,

37:42.718 --> 37:44.022
and then come catch you.

37:44.022 --> 37:44.890
I can't skydive.

37:44.890 --> 37:46.961
That's the least
of our worries, Rog.

37:46.961 --> 37:48.697

37:56.546 --> 37:58.550
Riggs! (screams)

38:00.087 --> 38:02.425

the wrong way, Rog,

38:45.945 --> 38:47.815
but I need a little space.
