THE SPOTLIGHT'S
ON YOU,

21:12.100 --> 21:14.200
AND SOMETIMES
IT GOES AROUND

21:14.200 --> 21:15.400
AND HITS
SOMEONE ELSE.
UGH!

21:15.400 --> 21:19.033
AND NOW SOME DACHSHUND'S
BASKING IN IT.

21:19.033 --> 21:21.300
MADELINE,
THE IMPORTANT
THING IS

21:21.300 --> 21:22.967
YOU DID A GOOD DEED.

21:22.967 --> 21:24.467
THAT IS TRUE.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.600
I DID SAVE TWO LIVES.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.667
MM! BUT THE DACHSHUND SAVED
A CAT. THAT'S 9 LIVES.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.500
SO HE'S GOT YOU
BEAT BY 7.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.767
Moseby: YOU KNOW,

21:33.767 --> 21:36.867
ONE OF THE LIVES SHE
SAVED WAS YOURS.

21:36.867 --> 21:38.600
OH, YEAH.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.233
YAY YOU!

21:42.667 --> 21:46.600
LONDON, YOU'VE
NEVER YAYED ANYONE
BUT YOURSELF.

21:46.600 --> 21:50.033
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YAY ME!

21:53.600 --> 21:55.567
PATRICK?
HMM?

21:55.567 --> 21:58.700
THE MOROCCAN THEME
IS OVER. WHY ARE YOU
STILL WEARING THIS?

21:58.700 --> 22:01.734
FRANKLY, I FIND
THESE PUFFY PANTS TO BE

22:01.734 --> 22:03.200
DELIGHTFULLY ROOMY.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.867
AHH.

22:04.867 --> 22:07.133
I THINK I'M
GOING TO WEAR THEM
TO WORK EVERY DAY,

22:07.133 --> 22:09.233
STAND IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE RESTAURANT,

22:09.233 --> 22:12.100
WHERE EVERYONE
CAN SEE THEM A-BLOWING
IN THE BREEZE.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.400
[SOFTLY]
OH. NO, NO, NO. STOP.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.600
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]

22:15.600 --> 22:16.934
PATRICK?
HMM?

22:16.934 --> 22:18.867
RIGHT. WHAT IF I GET
YOU A NEW PODIUM?
AND A RAISE.

22:18.867 --> 22:20.300
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.100
I'M PREPARED
TO QUIT.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.834
I'M PREPARED TO
REPLACE YOU.
A PODIUM IT IS.
