WEBVTT

00:16.249 --> 00:18.550
You're blocking the door, man.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.019
Sorry, sir.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.021
You're going to have
to use the rear entrance.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.223
Fine.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.026
Changed buildings.
Sorry again.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.601
Target's headed your way, boss.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.107
Hey!

00:44.377 --> 00:45.377
Watch it!

00:45.379 --> 00:47.179
How'd you get
back here anyway?

00:47.181 --> 00:49.681
Get lost.
Get lost. Get lost.

00:53.286 --> 00:54.686
(chuckling)

00:54.688 --> 00:56.155
No, so I actually said to her,

00:56.157 --> 00:57.689
"get your hands off my man,
you bitch.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.558
Stay away from him."

00:59.560 --> 01:01.226
Yes, I did.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.494
And you know what
she told me?

01:02.496 --> 01:05.064
She actually had the
nerve to look at me

01:05.066 --> 01:06.165
In the eye
and pretend...

01:06.167 --> 01:07.466
Hey!
(screams)

01:07.468 --> 01:09.101
Federal agent!

01:10.303 --> 01:11.437
You let her go, khan.

01:12.672 --> 01:14.206
Khan:
Who are you?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.175
Homeland?

01:16.177 --> 01:18.110
Fbi?

01:20.213 --> 01:21.814
You won't shoot.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.751
Whoever you are,
you want me alive.

01:26.619 --> 01:29.088
(grunting)

01:32.759 --> 01:34.493
Nice job, sexy.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.727
Next time,
you wear the heels.

01:35.729 --> 01:36.795
Okay.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.798
Is the computer
all right?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.366
Easy does it, mcgoo.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.169
It's completely fine.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.671
(sighs)

01:45.673 --> 01:47.439
Mcgee:
He's a lot smaller in person.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.874
Well, we finally got him, boss.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.743
This is going to put a big hole
in the most wanted list.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.347
(ziva sighs)

02:28.349 --> 02:30.682
This is my favorite part.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.217
What?
Riding in the elevator?

02:32.219 --> 02:35.220
Returning home
as conquering heroes.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.722
Like caesar
entering rome

02:36.724 --> 02:38.223
After defeating the gauls.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.358
(sniffs)

02:39.360 --> 02:40.792
You are in need of a roman bath.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.828
(sniffing)

02:42.830 --> 02:45.464
We just took down ajay khan,

02:45.466 --> 02:47.466
Guy who hacked
into mtac last month.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.634
Kind of a big deal.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.935
Resulted in the death
of an agent.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.703
What exactly
are you expecting?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.305
Recognition.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.540
(elevator bell dings)

02:54.542 --> 02:56.441
Excuse me.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.378
Hello!

02:59.380 --> 03:01.713
All hail. (chuckles)

03:01.715 --> 03:05.450
Number two cyberterrorist
in the world.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.919
Fbi security breach.

03:06.921 --> 03:08.620
The homeland hack
last year.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.755
Come on!

03:09.757 --> 03:13.892
Perhaps they would prefer
the number one cyberterrorist.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.894
The man who
planned everything.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.329
(light applause)

03:17.331 --> 03:19.298
(laughs)
oh.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.599
I get it.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.401
I see.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.803
Two minutes enjoying the win--

03:24.805 --> 03:26.738
Is that really
too much to ask?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.507
(sniffs) I do smell
like bologna.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.310
Look, I know that khan

03:31.312 --> 03:33.845
Is going to lead me
to his employer.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.814
Which is why
I already requested

03:35.816 --> 03:37.516
His full fbi file,

03:37.518 --> 03:39.418
And I'm going to use it
as leverage.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.719
Feed me grapes, woman.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.789
Soon as they e-mail the rest,
our little hipster's

03:43.791 --> 03:46.325
Going to be singing
like a bird.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.428
What's going on?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.929
What?!
The network is down again?!

03:50.931 --> 03:52.864
What is this?
We can catch the best

03:52.866 --> 03:55.500
Cyberterrorist in the world,
but we can't check our e-mail?

03:55.502 --> 03:58.870
You caught the second best
cyberterrorist, agent dinozzo.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.773
Wi-fi's down again, kevin.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.476
And ajay khan,
who can help us find

04:04.478 --> 04:05.811
The first best
cyberterrorist,

04:05.813 --> 04:08.413
The digital bin laden,
we can get him,

04:08.415 --> 04:11.250
But we need
our computer to do it!

04:11.252 --> 04:13.619
Since the attack on
mtac, my department

04:13.621 --> 04:16.255
Has been implementing new
internet security features

04:16.257 --> 04:18.357
That have momentarily
slowed the system.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.458
For how long?

04:19.460 --> 04:20.792
As long as it takes

04:20.794 --> 04:22.261
To make sure
that we're safe.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.263
Field agents aren't
the only ones

04:24.265 --> 04:26.732
That take the death of one
of our own personally.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.400
Understood.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.535
Just let me know.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.371
Always nice
to see you, kev.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.706
Hi, kev.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.675
Agent david,
would you make sure

04:36.677 --> 04:38.010
That, uh, tim gets this?

04:38.012 --> 04:39.678
He wanted to come.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.948
Tony:
Hmm... What do you got there?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.616
Huh.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.285
Improvisational comedy.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.819
You?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.755
Uh, I'm taking
classes downtown.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.758
I'm funnier than you think.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.595
Because of the beard,
our skits usually end up

04:56.597 --> 04:57.996
With me playing
the bumbling terrorist,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.831
But it's a blast.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.902
Terrorist... Blast.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.437
That's improv.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.741
You'll be here in how long?

05:09.743 --> 05:12.044
I don't know. Hold on.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.314
Who are you?

05:15.316 --> 05:18.817
Special agent gibbs, ncis.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.952
You catch that?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.721
Yeah, fine.
I'll see you then.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.858
Love the phone, man.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.428
My lawyer won't be here
till tomorrow, so until then...

05:29.430 --> 05:30.896
(phone clattering on floor)

05:30.898 --> 05:33.899
I don't care.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.603
Special agent james hunt
was undercover

05:38.605 --> 05:40.672
When your hack
took down the system.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.774
It gave away his position.

05:42.776 --> 05:46.111
Don't send your people
where they don't belong.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.517
He was tortured
to death.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.753
Look at it!

05:56.389 --> 05:58.623
That's terrorism.

06:00.626 --> 06:04.096
Do you want to avoid
a life at gitmo?

06:04.098 --> 06:09.901
I need your employer's
u.P. Address.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.705
Okay, wait, wait.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.475
Please.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.978
He only... He only goes
by the letters "mc."

06:19.980 --> 06:21.880
We know that.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.515
Well, I don't know his name.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.983
Nobody does.

06:24.985 --> 06:29.087
But I... I do know
where you can find him.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.957
There's just one...
Problem.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.992
(laughs)

06:39.532 --> 06:42.033
You don't even know
what an ip address is.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.536
(laughing)

06:44.538 --> 06:46.004
You're a dinosaur, man.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.639
And come on.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.008
That terrorism bs
still work?

06:50.010 --> 06:52.077
And gitmo?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.645
That place
is a political black hole.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.781
No one's been sent there
in five years.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.450
And you believe that?

07:00.052 --> 07:01.686
Look, you could charge me

07:01.688 --> 07:03.688
With second-degree
manslaughter at best.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.424
I don't need
anything from you

07:05.426 --> 07:08.026
That'll make me
talk, so...

07:08.028 --> 07:09.461
Good luck trying.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.662
I won't need luck.

07:10.664 --> 07:15.801
Gonna send you and your boss to
cuba on a permanent vacation.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.004
Sounds like
an aerosmith album.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.907
That's your era, right?

07:21.909 --> 07:24.576
Old school?

07:26.179 --> 07:27.913
Damn right.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.751
Boss, I am so sorry.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.985
I thought for sure I wrote

07:33.987 --> 07:35.821
"ip address" correctly
in my notes.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.056
You did.
What?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.991
Yeah, the guy
thinks we're dumb.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.494
Just want to
prove he's right.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.142
Abby?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.510
Too close?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.212
I'm already sweating.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.747
I like your musk, mcgee.

08:02.749 --> 08:06.017
It's this foundation
of brilliance,

08:06.019 --> 08:09.688
Layered with years
of experience,

08:09.690 --> 08:14.159
With these lovely
notes of... Anxiety.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.094
Does it make you nervous
when I'm this close?

08:16.096 --> 08:19.064
No; makes me nervous
this won't work.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.565
I looked up khan's records.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.000
He's a fellow beaver.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.001
Oh.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.937
Now I smell mit envy.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.639
No.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.608
Just that he's
very good.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.943
He hacked the school database
his freshman year.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.612
Now, khan is bound to have

08:33.614 --> 08:35.614
Multiple fail-safes
installed on this computer.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.749
That's why we rerouted
the power source,

08:37.751 --> 08:40.185
Mirrored the display
and blind-patched the keyboard.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.521
The computer
won't even know it's on,

08:42.523 --> 08:43.688
Let alone
someone's snooping.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.856
Okay.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.191
Ready.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.226
Relax, mcgee.
We're better than this guy.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.195
Let's find out.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.696
All right.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.831
Here we go.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.134
We're in. That's the contents
of the hard drive.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.138
Wait, no, no, no.
Quick, quick, unplug everything.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.776
Mcgee...

09:04.778 --> 09:07.145
Did we just fail?

09:07.147 --> 09:09.614
If what I think
just happened, happened...

09:09.616 --> 09:11.216
Yeah, we did.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.619
So, any chance of getting info
off khan's computer is gone?

09:14.621 --> 09:17.055
Like I said, this guy's good.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.791
And that's bad.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.335
Ducky: Ajay khan is what
my mother's american cousin

09:30.337 --> 09:33.004
Used to call
a "slippery one,"

09:33.006 --> 09:35.340
When she was talking
about the catfish

09:35.342 --> 09:37.776
We used to catch
in hapsheed's creek.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.010
Ah, they're the same, duck.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.579
They're both bottom-feeders.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.581
Yes, but you caught this one,

09:42.583 --> 09:45.750
And you've connected him
to the attack on mtac.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.786
I want the guy
who paid him to do it.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.821
The elusive "mc."

09:49.823 --> 09:53.124
No face, no name... No motive.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.359
Yeah, but this time,

09:54.361 --> 09:57.629
It cost a federal
agent his life.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.931
Mr. Khan knows he's
going to prison.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.933
Yeah, well,
he also knows the judge

10:01.935 --> 10:03.668
Would throw out
any deal we offer.

10:03.670 --> 10:07.272
And because his computer
went up in smoke,

10:07.274 --> 10:10.742
You now need something to
convince our slippery fish

10:10.744 --> 10:12.811
That giving up
his master of ceremonies

10:12.813 --> 10:14.613
Would be in his
own best interest.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.815
Duck, that's why you're doing
the psych profile.

10:16.817 --> 10:22.621
Well, khan only gauges
success by money.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.991
After his parents died,
he became a loner.

10:25.993 --> 10:30.128
No family, no friends,
no loved ones, certainly no one

10:30.130 --> 10:31.663
You could use
as leverage.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.331
He's got to care
about something.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.768
Well, according to his
buying habits, it's himself.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.737
So, as a narcissist...

10:38.739 --> 10:40.705
We know what he's scared of.

10:40.707 --> 10:41.840
Losing everything.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.675
And, ultimately, his life.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.677
He would be scared of death.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.845
(chuckling)

10:46.847 --> 10:49.414
But then his employer
is a greater threat

10:49.416 --> 10:51.116
In that department
than we are.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.685
So let's get creative.

10:53.687 --> 10:57.155
Well, besides multiple
federal agencies,

10:57.157 --> 10:58.657
Khan has other enemies.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.659
For example,

11:00.661 --> 11:03.194
To throw the fbi
off his scent,

11:03.196 --> 11:06.398
He lead authorities
to a terrorist cell

11:06.400 --> 11:07.732
In new york city.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.234
He double-crossed
former employers.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.935
That's the theory.

11:10.937 --> 11:14.139
And those same men

11:14.141 --> 11:17.409
Are now high-value detainees
in camp delta, aka...

11:17.411 --> 11:19.711
Guantanamo bay.

11:19.713 --> 11:23.114
The threat of gitmo actually
rings true for mr. Khan.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.051
Mandrake:
<i>I like the way you think,</i>
<i>gibbs.</i>

11:26.053 --> 11:28.987
A three-hour intimidation flight
to camp delta?

11:28.989 --> 11:30.755
That's a new one for me,

11:30.757 --> 11:32.757
But if you think it'll get
this scumbag to talk,

11:32.759 --> 11:34.693
The air force
will have a plane ready.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.827
Craig:
Excuse me.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.962
Uh, may I step in,
agent gibbs?

11:37.964 --> 11:40.732
It's your agency, director.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.267
General, I'm acting
ncis director

11:42.269 --> 11:43.768
Jerome craig.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.036
Since we don't have
authorization

11:45.038 --> 11:46.371
To actually detain
mr. Khan

11:46.373 --> 11:48.273
When he gets to cuba,
this is a political nightmare

11:48.275 --> 11:49.441
Gift-wrapped in red tape.

11:49.443 --> 11:52.744
If we go
through proper channels...

11:52.746 --> 11:56.181
The fewer able to know
about this, the better, sir.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.782
The...

11:57.784 --> 11:59.184
You want me to go behind backs?

11:59.186 --> 12:00.819
That's a big risk,

12:00.821 --> 12:02.387
Gentlemen.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.956
The cost of fuel
is a small price to pay

12:04.958 --> 12:06.725
For neutralizing a threat
to national security, sir.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.128
I suppose so.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.097
Uh... Maybe.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.832
You just let me know
what you need, sir.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.333
I have to jump off.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.768
Director craig.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.203
Gibbs.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.810
You think I'm being soft,
right?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.248
This is very unorthodox.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.751
I can't sell the higher-ups on
the need for such urgent action.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.352
Sorry.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.789
Risks aren't my specialty.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.300
New look, abb?

12:49.302 --> 12:51.436
This is grandpa sciuto's recipe

12:51.438 --> 12:52.937
For homemade pomade.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.839
It's, um, beeswax,

12:54.841 --> 12:56.975
Ginger root,
unleaded gasoline...

12:56.977 --> 12:59.210
God, that stinks.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.179
It's better than the smell
of failure.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.182
I couldn't even wash the smoke
out of my hair this morning.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.850
That's gone.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.385
Doubly so,

13:07.387 --> 13:11.422
Because I managed to turn me
and mcgee's colossal failure

13:11.424 --> 13:12.924
Into a minor success.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.292
Video camera?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.527
Just before khan's
computer died,

13:15.529 --> 13:18.496
We got a momentary glimpse

13:18.498 --> 13:20.532
At the hard drive,
and because mcgee

13:20.534 --> 13:23.868
And I operate at the highest
levels of professionalism...

13:23.870 --> 13:25.236
You filmed everything.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.305
Baby got backup, gibbs.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.808
Most of what we saw was

13:29.810 --> 13:31.876
Just digital gobbledygook,

13:31.878 --> 13:33.178
But then I noticed this.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.580
It's an address

13:35.582 --> 13:37.816
Of an old warehouse
in anacostia.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.350
There's nothing to indicate
what we'll find there,

13:39.352 --> 13:42.020
But if khan is interested
in this place...

13:42.022 --> 13:43.354
So are we.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.390
Great work, abbs.

13:45.392 --> 13:49.060
From the ashes,
mcabby will rise.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.004
All warehouses
are the same.

14:00.006 --> 14:04.142
Up there with old houses,
churches and prisons.

14:05.077 --> 14:06.611
They give me the willies.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.247
Is that the thing
where people lick their fingers

14:09.249 --> 14:10.915
And then they put it
in someone's ear?

14:10.917 --> 14:12.250
That's a wet willy.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.619
I'm talking about the creeps.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.121
So are the creeps related
to the willies?

14:17.123 --> 14:19.557
All descendants
of the heebie-jeebies.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.092
What?

14:23.863 --> 14:24.963
(whispering):
Ziva?

14:31.637 --> 14:34.606
Well, I guess we can rule out
death by natural causes.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.879
Tony:
I've seen this before.

14:40.881 --> 14:44.582
You better call
the hazmat team.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.318
Gibbs:
Robert mellish.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.889
We traced info from your
computer, and we found him,

14:50.891 --> 14:53.491
Killed by the ebola virus.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.894
Rare...

14:55.896 --> 14:58.897
Contagious, deadly.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.331
You on twitter, agent gibbs?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.267
'cause your natural
speech patterns

15:02.269 --> 15:05.003
Are already less
than 140 characters.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.673
He was the warehouse caretaker,
but he doubled

15:08.675 --> 15:10.608
As a bomb-maker.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.246
This your latest project
for mc?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.615
There's two ways this can go.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.417
I'm not talking,

15:19.419 --> 15:20.652
So what's my second choice?

15:20.654 --> 15:23.087
Admit you're stupid.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.657
A colleague of mine
said you're smart.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.392
I told him I don't think so.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.994
I think you're just as dumb
as the last guys.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.195
What?

15:31.197 --> 15:32.563
Ebola virus?

15:32.565 --> 15:35.099
It's been done.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.168
Hell, you're not
even original.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.373
Well, like you said,
all mc's idea.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.309
(laughs)

15:44.311 --> 15:45.944
I knew it.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.078
You're not even the brains.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.713
Mcgee...

15:48.715 --> 15:50.682
You owe me 20 bucks, man.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.116
Uh, if I were you colleague,

15:52.118 --> 15:54.419
I'd wait a couple of days
before you pay up.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.355
That's when you plan
to release the virus?

16:01.060 --> 16:03.494
Thanks.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.298
That's all I needed.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.968
Hey, I didn't admit anything.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.470
My attorney
should be here soon, so...

16:14.039 --> 16:16.574
If your attorney does show,

16:16.576 --> 16:19.477
We'll be sure and give him
your new address.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.091
(rattling)

16:39.765 --> 16:42.266
Soldier:
Prisoner secured, sir.

16:49.141 --> 16:50.708
Best seat on the plane.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.077
Tony:
In the event of a water landing,

16:53.079 --> 16:55.113
You're pretty screwed, though.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.082
(ziva chuckles)
hey, did you bring
those snacks I asked for?

16:58.084 --> 17:00.084
It's only a three-hour flight
to cuba, tony.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.387
Patience.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.089
Ziva:
Chocolate malt balls

17:05.091 --> 17:06.624
And gummy bears, yes?

17:06.626 --> 17:09.460
Tony: You're a life saver.
You didn't ask for those.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.531
You really think this will work?

17:14.466 --> 17:16.601
You expect me to believe

17:16.603 --> 17:19.337
That you're escorting me
to guantanamo bay?

17:20.672 --> 17:22.807
Ready to rock and roll, sir.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.176
That's a go!

17:25.178 --> 17:27.111
This is insane.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.413
Malt ball?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.048
Crewman:
We're gonna need you
to sign this.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.050
Last chance to talk.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.686
I could use some sun.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.359
Tony:
Hey, ajay,

17:41.361 --> 17:44.195
In boxing, what's the most
important part of the punch?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.732
The follow-through.

17:50.602 --> 17:51.736
(hatch slams)

17:54.773 --> 17:56.307
Enjoy the flight.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.224
It safe, duck?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.093
What's that, jethro?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.628
(muffled):
I said, "is it safe?"

18:17.630 --> 18:21.265
I can't hear you
through the doors.

18:22.568 --> 18:25.803
I'm gonna take that as "yes."

18:25.805 --> 18:28.539
It's safe to come in.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.675
(sighs)

18:32.277 --> 18:33.845
Cdc officials

18:33.847 --> 18:36.447
Took samples with them

18:36.449 --> 18:39.250
And then gave me the go-ahead
to finish the autopsy,

18:39.252 --> 18:42.553
But while the
pathogen only spreads

18:42.555 --> 18:45.223
Via contact with
bodily fluids,

18:45.225 --> 18:46.858
It's prudent to
keep our distance.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.626
Can't be too careful.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.561
Well, he wasn't.

18:50.563 --> 18:54.465
It's not yet possible to prove
how the disease was acquired,

18:54.467 --> 18:55.700
But I did find

18:55.702 --> 18:57.668
This curious cut
on his finger.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.836
That a paper cut?

18:58.838 --> 19:02.874
It reminded me of a wound
that mr. Palmer sustained

19:02.876 --> 19:06.310
Last year,
from the aluminum seal

19:06.312 --> 19:07.612
On a bottle
of hypertonic saline.

19:07.614 --> 19:11.616
Would an ebola sample have
that kind of seal?

19:11.618 --> 19:12.884
Perhaps.

19:12.886 --> 19:16.187
But who would willingly open
pandora's box?

19:21.660 --> 19:24.262
Give me a time of death.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.165
I'd say he died
12 hours ago,

19:27.167 --> 19:29.734
But acquired the virus
about a week ago.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.537
Well, ebola is painful.

19:32.539 --> 19:36.340
It typically causes the major
organs to soften and dissolve,

19:36.342 --> 19:37.575
But in his case,

19:37.577 --> 19:41.512
Only his left kidney liquefied,

19:41.514 --> 19:43.581
Which suggests that this is

19:43.583 --> 19:45.483
A weakened strain of the virus.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.617
So what does that mean?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.486
No idea.

19:48.488 --> 19:52.757
To the mystery of not only how,
but why, it was acquired.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.692
Yeah, well,
we're working on that.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.794
(wry chuckle)
on the ground and in the air.

19:56.796 --> 20:00.631
How is our acting director

20:00.633 --> 20:02.567
Handling your bifurcated plan?

20:02.569 --> 20:04.635
(knocking)

20:05.537 --> 20:07.572
Oh, speak of the devil.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.407
Well, he looks
a little nervous to me.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.311
Duck, I got it.

20:15.314 --> 20:16.747
Gibbs, I was hoping
we could, uh...

20:16.749 --> 20:17.915
Come on.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.350
Not here.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.626
You're right.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.928
Uh, my office is a much
better place to discuss...

20:32.831 --> 20:34.799
Go ahead.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.301
This is where you want
to talk about...

20:37.303 --> 20:39.270
We won't be disturbed.

20:39.272 --> 20:43.274
Uh, about the, uh,
flight to cuba.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.742
It's a matter
of national security

20:44.744 --> 20:48.613
To find out what khan knows
about an imminent attack.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.015
I know.
I signed off on that part.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.516
It's the, uh... (sighs)

20:52.518 --> 20:55.620
It's the second part
I'm fuzzy on.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.788
What happens if the flight alone

20:57.790 --> 20:59.490
Doesn't scare him enough
to talk?

20:59.492 --> 21:01.592
Gitmo isn't just a hotel
you can check people into.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.294
What happens after they land?

21:03.296 --> 21:04.762
When it comes to that,

21:04.764 --> 21:08.366
That'll be your call
to make, director.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.036
(elevator whirrs)
whoa.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.311
(vomiting)

21:20.313 --> 21:22.546
You need a hand there, tony?

21:22.548 --> 21:24.782
I've smelled a lot of
puke in my day, ziva,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.484
Believe me.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.585
Are you done?

21:28.654 --> 21:30.454
Let me guess,
you became, um,

21:30.456 --> 21:32.923
A vomit connoisseur in college?

21:32.925 --> 21:35.926
Baltimore narcotics,
and compared to a smack addict

21:35.928 --> 21:38.529
Who's just binged
on beltway burgers...

21:38.531 --> 21:39.764
(sighs)

21:39.766 --> 21:41.699
...This is nothing.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.668
Natural ingredients
break down faster.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.636
I only eat organic.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.538
Well, that's about to change.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.040
Along with a few
other aspects

21:49.042 --> 21:51.542
Of your ironic
hipster lifestyle.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.377
So what do you say, chaka khan?

21:53.379 --> 21:55.579
You ready to roll on mc hammer?

21:55.581 --> 21:57.615
You don't know anything
about music.

21:57.617 --> 22:01.419
I know it pretty much died
around 1977.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.087
Look, this little psych-out

22:03.089 --> 22:04.889
Of yours is deeply flawed.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.058
I'm much safer
as a prisoner in cuba

22:07.060 --> 22:08.893
Than as a rat in dc.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.494
I would not be so sure.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.796
You do remember

22:11.798 --> 22:14.498
Your former employers, right?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.068
You screwed them over
to save yourself.

22:17.070 --> 22:18.803
Tony: In case you didn't get
their last ramadan card,

22:18.805 --> 22:21.472
They've since moved to gitmo.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.840
And they have had plenty of time

22:22.842 --> 22:24.475
To think
about who put them there.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.544
Tony: Wouldn't it be a
coincidence if you were put

22:26.546 --> 22:27.745
In the same camp?

22:27.747 --> 22:30.381
Or even, say, the same cell?

22:30.383 --> 22:31.649
Ziva:
It's a small world.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.917
Tony:
Rule 39a:

22:32.919 --> 22:35.553
No such thing.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.688
No.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.124
No, you don't have the power
to pull those kinds of strings.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.126
(ziva laughs)

22:42.128 --> 22:44.695
Clearly you have not spent
enough time with gibbs.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.130
You keep trying.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.566
It's entertaining.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.067
Abby:
Where is he?

22:50.069 --> 22:53.971
I am brimming with information,
and no gibbs?

22:53.973 --> 22:56.607
And for that matter,
where is mcgee?

22:56.609 --> 22:58.809
I feel like
there's some party going on

22:58.811 --> 23:00.378
And no one told me, bert.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.479
It's need to know.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.781
And you don't want to,
believe me.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.383
May I come in,
miss sciuto?

23:05.385 --> 23:06.784
Director craig, of course.

23:06.786 --> 23:11.088
You trying out
a new, uh, hair product?

23:11.090 --> 23:14.859
Oh, um,
it's for failure anxiety.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.661
Ah.
Actually,

23:17.663 --> 23:19.864
It's for fixing tractors,

23:19.866 --> 23:22.500
But my grandpa
didn't label the can.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.835
So, boom, happy accident.

23:24.837 --> 23:27.071
And this is pertinent
to the case?

23:27.073 --> 23:28.105
Kind of.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.608
I ran tests on the ebola

23:30.610 --> 23:32.810
That killed
our warehouse victim.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.545
Autopsy report
says it's a weakened strain.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.447
Yes, and I found out why.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.082
This particular strain

23:38.084 --> 23:41.619
Was developed to help people
instead of killing them.

23:41.621 --> 23:44.121
Yeah, a vaccine.
Yes, tested on poor,
little, fluffy mice.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.957
Obviously, it didn't work
because our warehouse victim...

23:46.959 --> 23:48.692
And the poor, little,
fluffy mice...

23:48.694 --> 23:49.860
Yeah, are all dead.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.429
Who developed it?

23:51.431 --> 23:52.863
Centers for disease control.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.098
I mean, fortunately,

23:54.100 --> 23:55.599
Our government
keeps these things

23:55.601 --> 23:57.868
Under a strict
security protocol,

23:57.870 --> 23:59.937
But unfortunately...
Those protocols were breached.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.872
Like mtac.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.642
So rather than being
slated for destruction,

24:04.644 --> 24:08.712
The faulty vaccines were
shipped as flu vaccines.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.815
To the warehouse,

24:10.817 --> 24:12.583
Where our victim makes bombs.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.885
Instead of a flu vaccine, boom.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.654
Ebola bomb.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.123
So someone unknowingly
opens the box.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.958
The disease spreads.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.194
We're talking hundreds,
maybe thousands of lives.

24:23.196 --> 24:25.830
Yes.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.631
Excuse me.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.600
I have a call to make.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.807
Where are the ebola samples?

24:36.809 --> 24:38.909
Who has them?

24:38.911 --> 24:40.711
He's still not talking,
director.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.146
What do you want us to do?

24:43.648 --> 24:45.716
I see.
Will do, sir.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.918
Yes, sir.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.255
What did he say?

24:51.257 --> 24:53.123
It's time to change the game.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.124
How?

24:54.126 --> 24:56.227
By not making it
a game anymore.

24:56.229 --> 24:57.962
Well, that's not
gonna be easy.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.964
Special agents dinozzo and
david, I need you to strap in.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.500
We're about to start our descent
into camp delta.

25:02.502 --> 25:06.003
You can't imprison me
without due process.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.571
Beside, you don't have
the resources to go

25:07.573 --> 25:08.873
That far off the grid.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.041
(chuckles)
not to mention the balls.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.880
Well, maybe we don't,

25:15.882 --> 25:17.615
But our bosses do.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.686
Sleepy time.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.755
Old school.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.707
Hey, kev!

25:43.709 --> 25:45.142
What are you doing?

25:45.144 --> 25:47.545
Oh, did gibbs break
another phone?

25:47.547 --> 25:50.915
Do you know how hard it is
to find these things?

25:50.917 --> 25:52.683
Are you okay?

25:52.685 --> 25:54.552
You seem really nervous.

25:54.554 --> 25:55.853
I have this pomade,
if you...

25:55.855 --> 25:57.288
When gibbs called,
he sounded like he had

25:57.290 --> 25:58.656
Something else on his mind.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.792
He already chewed me out
after the mtac mess,

26:01.794 --> 26:03.827
So he's not gonna
fire me, right?

26:03.829 --> 26:06.697
Well, gibbs isn't in charge
of cyber division,

26:06.699 --> 26:07.831
So he can't fire you.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.867
I mean, unless
you... Hey, gibbs.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.936
Where you been?
What do you got, abbs?

26:11.938 --> 26:13.904
I was able to locate our
missing ebola samples.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.039
Yeah, go.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.875
Okay, so when khan hacked
the cdc,

26:17.877 --> 26:21.011
He mislabeled and shipped
our faulty vaccines

26:21.013 --> 26:22.046
As flu shots.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.914
To the warehouse.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.984
Where he could have paid
our dead guy to booby-trap them.

26:26.986 --> 26:27.985
Once someone opens that box...

26:27.987 --> 26:31.855
Given the generation time
of ebola

26:31.857 --> 26:33.057
And the population
of the metro area,

26:33.059 --> 26:34.291
The r-o value

26:34.293 --> 26:36.060
Of this particular
pandemic model

26:36.062 --> 26:37.194
Would be very high.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.996
And what are we gonna do
about that?

26:38.998 --> 26:40.130
We're gonna track

26:40.132 --> 26:41.799
The shipment.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.300
I ran records on all the
major shipping companies,

26:43.302 --> 26:45.869
And I found a single pickup
at our ebola warehouse.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.371
I mean, assuming they haven't
been re-labeled again...

26:47.373 --> 26:49.039
Abby.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.041
The delivery trucks have gps.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.711
Send it to mcgee.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.879
Kevin, phone?

26:58.116 --> 27:00.317
See, he can't fire you.
(sighs)

27:00.319 --> 27:01.952
Director's waiting
for you downstairs.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.622
He can't,
but director craig can.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.156
Come on, let's go!

27:14.032 --> 27:16.066
(speaking spanish)

27:16.968 --> 27:18.002
<i>Hola.</i>

27:18.004 --> 27:20.738
What?

27:23.775 --> 27:25.275
Oh, my god, you bastards.

27:25.277 --> 27:28.112
My lawyers are gonna have
a media field day.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.780
Think about that for a second.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.650
If we had to knock you out
to sneak you in here...

27:32.652 --> 27:35.185
Then we're long past caring
about what is legal.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.254
(man screaming in arabic)

27:42.694 --> 27:44.695
Well, it sounds like your
friends know you're here.

27:44.697 --> 27:46.697
(screaming continues)

27:46.699 --> 27:48.832
"give him to me."

27:50.735 --> 27:53.237
"you pig, you coward."

27:54.939 --> 27:56.940
"die."
oh, my god.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.809
And a few more expletives,
but it would be

27:58.811 --> 28:02.079
Very unladylike of
me to repeat them.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.081
You bastards.
Tony: You know what?

28:04.083 --> 28:06.684
Why don't you
just sit here, pumpkin,

28:06.686 --> 28:08.018
And think about that
for a second.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.320
(screaming continues)

28:14.392 --> 28:16.760
Closing cell 117.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.729
How do you expect to
get away with this?

28:18.731 --> 28:20.964
Friends in high places.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.742
(quietly):
Oh, my god...

28:31.744 --> 28:33.744
(sighing):
Oh, my god.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.412
Officer:
Uh, pull forward.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.147
Mcgee:
I'm surprised metro's willing

28:37.149 --> 28:38.982
To help us out
on such short notice.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.085
They know what's at stake.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.954
According to the gps signal,

28:43.956 --> 28:46.123
Our delivery van
is headed this way.

28:49.027 --> 28:49.993
Hey. Mcgee.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.862
(horn honking)

28:51.864 --> 28:54.164
Right on time.

28:56.034 --> 28:59.103
(man yelling in arabic)

29:01.473 --> 29:04.842
(ziva speaking arabic)

29:04.844 --> 29:06.276
I told him it was a sin
to talk like that

29:06.278 --> 29:08.045
To a woman he's not related to.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.146
(yelling continues)

29:09.148 --> 29:12.149
Open cell 117.

29:14.385 --> 29:17.087
Hey, there, mr. Orange.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.123
You missed lunch, so we
thought wed scrounge you up

29:19.125 --> 29:20.390
A little something to eat.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.092
I doubt that it's
organically grown.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.460
Hah!
Doubt it's grown at all.

29:23.462 --> 29:27.097
You bring me here
and you risk my life,

29:27.099 --> 29:30.267
And you expect
there to be no consequences?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.236
That's what's wrong
with this military

29:32.238 --> 29:34.037
And this country.

29:34.039 --> 29:37.141
You're lecturing us
on right and wrong.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.176
The agent who died because
of you had a wife

29:39.178 --> 29:40.444
And a six-year-old son.
And you think

29:40.446 --> 29:42.546
This is the justice that
they were looking for?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.081
No, but it prevents others

29:44.083 --> 29:46.250
From needing
to seek justice at all.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.785
This must end.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.453
It won't.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.355
Today it's ebola courtesy
of some whack job

29:51.357 --> 29:53.123
Who calls himself mc.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.091
Tomorrow it's
someone else.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.893
Why?
Who knows and who cares?

29:55.895 --> 29:58.128
The point is that
whether I'm in here or not,

29:58.130 --> 29:59.830
There's always someone else.

29:59.832 --> 30:01.965
(tray crashing, clattering)

30:01.967 --> 30:04.067
(man yelling in arabic)

30:04.069 --> 30:06.069
That's why we're here,

30:06.071 --> 30:07.905
To clean up the mess.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.907
I'm not telling you anything.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.975
Soldier:
Agents dinozzo, david!

30:12.944 --> 30:14.278
It's okay, sergeant;
we got it covered.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.113
Base commander needs to see you.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.250
The base commander
knows we're here?

30:20.252 --> 30:22.085
Did he say what it was about?

30:22.087 --> 30:23.821
Sorry.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.290
We tried to keep it low-key,

30:26.292 --> 30:27.958
But game's over.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.126
We should talk to him.

30:29.128 --> 30:30.093
Yeah.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.361
Only one of you.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.197
Tony:
What?

30:33.199 --> 30:35.432
Since he legally doesn't belong
in here, you've been ordered

30:35.434 --> 30:37.601
To stay with your prisoner.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.903
(chuckling)
in here?

30:39.905 --> 30:41.171
Sorry, agent dinozzo.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.840
Orders.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.843
In case you need anything.

30:50.982 --> 30:53.250
Closing cell 117.

30:55.887 --> 30:57.521
(chuckles)

30:57.523 --> 31:02.292
Oh, I guess those friends didn't
go high enough, huh, tony?

31:02.294 --> 31:05.229
Hey, do you have enough snacks
for the flight home?

31:08.099 --> 31:09.499
Driver:
I got a schedule to keep.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.535
I don't have time to drink.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.905
Federal agents.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.107
Get out.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.546
Okay, maybe I had a beer
before my last delivery,

31:22.548 --> 31:24.181
But that was
on my lunch break.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.250
Where are the samples?

31:26.252 --> 31:27.351
What?

31:27.353 --> 31:28.485
What are you talking about?

31:29.888 --> 31:32.422
What samples?

31:35.293 --> 31:37.194
Khan:
<i>The artistic conundrum</i>

31:37.196 --> 31:40.063
<i>With grunge is the fact</i>
<i>that it never had a chance</i>

31:40.065 --> 31:42.165
<i>To change into anything else,</i>
<i>as usually happens</i>

31:42.167 --> 31:44.301
<i>With other genres.</i>

31:44.303 --> 31:46.270
The best bands
just stopped recording

31:46.272 --> 31:48.238
Or broke up when the music
went mainstream.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.308
Soundgarden, screaming trees,
stone temple pilots.

31:51.310 --> 31:55.212
Kurt cobain, layne staley,
eddie vedder.

31:55.214 --> 31:56.146
I don't get you.

31:56.148 --> 31:59.616
You seem like a normal guy.

31:59.618 --> 32:04.321
Why do you risk your life
hacking for a terrorist?

32:04.323 --> 32:08.392
It's not like you're radical
or religious.

32:08.394 --> 32:11.361
It's not the 72 virgins.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.263
Why do you do what you do?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.301
If I asked you the same thing,

32:17.303 --> 32:21.171
I suspect our answers
would be the same.

32:21.173 --> 32:24.007
Hmm.

32:24.009 --> 32:26.009
Duty?

32:26.011 --> 32:27.477
No.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.947
There are two reasons
that are far more base.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.215
A steady paycheck.

32:34.152 --> 32:36.253
And power.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.421
Ah.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.256
The feeling that you've...

32:39.258 --> 32:41.124
Made a difference.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.994
Conquered something.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.228
Like caesar.

32:45.230 --> 32:48.665
Well, you're not
like caesar.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.068
You're more like tony
curtis, actually.

32:51.070 --> 32:54.371
I know music, not movies.

32:54.373 --> 32:57.507
<i>Spartacus.</i>

32:57.509 --> 33:00.444
You're the guy
with no power.

33:00.446 --> 33:05.215
And you're tony curtis,
because he just minced around,

33:05.217 --> 33:10.253
Singing songs and giving
people sponge baths.

33:12.190 --> 33:14.224
Maybe.

33:14.226 --> 33:17.361
But it's a job.

33:24.602 --> 33:26.069
That's weird.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.743
This another one of
your little tricks?

33:34.679 --> 33:37.214
(alarm blaring)

33:37.216 --> 33:39.149
What's going on?

33:39.151 --> 33:40.517
(men shouting in arabic)

33:40.519 --> 33:43.420
Khan:
What is this?

33:43.422 --> 33:46.757
Man (over p.A.): Attention.
Security breach in camp five.

33:46.759 --> 33:48.458
All personnel
are to remain where they are

33:48.460 --> 33:49.459
Until further instruction.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.128
Very clever.

33:51.130 --> 33:55.432
I'll be the first to admit
I'm good, but this is not...

33:55.434 --> 33:57.667
(gunfire blasting)

33:57.669 --> 33:58.668
Where's your gun?

33:58.670 --> 33:59.803
I checked it at security.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.338
It's base protocol.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.439
Are you serious?

34:02.441 --> 34:04.274
Shut up!

34:04.276 --> 34:07.210
This is ncis agent dinozzo.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.612
What's going on out there?

34:08.614 --> 34:10.480
(clicking radio switch)
come in.

34:10.482 --> 34:14.084
Sergeant!

34:14.086 --> 34:16.153
Anybody?

34:25.463 --> 34:28.432
This is ncis special
agent anthony dinozzo,

34:28.434 --> 34:30.300
Camp five, cell block a.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.568
Somebody please come in.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.703
Ziva (over radio):
Tony, come in.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.472
Hi, ziva.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.541
Thanks for
checking in on us.

34:37.543 --> 34:38.708
So what's going on out there?

34:38.710 --> 34:40.377
It is not good.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.546
The entire security mainframe
is down.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.114
What are you talking about?

34:44.116 --> 34:47.651
On an island we don't even have
trade with-- that's impossible.

34:47.653 --> 34:50.554
Nothing is impossible when
it comes to computer networks.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.557
Do they think it's been hacked?

34:53.559 --> 34:55.592
They are trying
to figure it out,

34:55.594 --> 34:57.127
But it is a possibility.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.462
(sighs):
Oh, my god!

34:58.464 --> 35:02.532
He found out I'm here, and
now he thinks I'm gonna flip.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.301
Who?
Who do you think?

35:04.303 --> 35:06.703
I told you, if he can hire me,
he can hire somebody else.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.573
Well, they have fail-safes
built in for this kind of thing.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.274
Never underestimate
the u.S. Military.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.643
Don't underestimate
geeks with computers.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.746
The cell door did open
on its own, ziva.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.448
Yours is not the only one.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.884
I'm trying to get back to you,
but be careful, tony.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.552
Out.

35:22.554 --> 35:25.222
(man yelling in arabic)

35:25.224 --> 35:26.756
Hey, where are you going now?

35:26.758 --> 35:29.559
There are 7,000 u.S. Troops
on this island.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.595
I'm gonna find one.
Shut the door, khan.

35:31.597 --> 35:35.632
Man: Hey, you!
This a bad end will have!

35:35.634 --> 35:36.766
Thanks, yoda.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.802
Man:
Don't walk away!

35:38.804 --> 35:41.138
You are not escaping!

35:41.140 --> 35:41.872
Hey...

35:41.874 --> 35:43.573
Sergeant.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.708
Where you been?

35:44.710 --> 35:47.377
How the hell did you
get out of your cell?

35:47.379 --> 35:49.679
I'm stuck with this guy, and
the door just pops open...

35:49.681 --> 35:51.348
(yelling)

35:51.350 --> 35:52.582
(grunting)

35:56.554 --> 35:57.787
(gunshot)

36:05.363 --> 36:07.597
Mcgee: The ebola sample's
got to be in one of these.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.267
Gibbs:
Zero-six-

36:10.269 --> 36:11.902
Alpha-delta-bravo-six.

36:15.239 --> 36:16.840
There it is, boss.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.408
Right on top.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.780
This box should
only contain our virus.

36:23.782 --> 36:24.948
I'm reading
electrical components.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.650
Eh, it's rigged.

36:26.652 --> 36:29.653
Mcgee: Luckily, I got
just the thing--

36:29.655 --> 36:32.255
Thermal imaging,
so you can see the wires.

36:32.257 --> 36:33.690
Been dying
to try this thing out.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.497
(grunting)

36:41.732 --> 36:42.899
(groans loudly)

36:43.968 --> 36:45.502
Hey...!

36:46.837 --> 36:47.737
(gasps)

36:48.606 --> 36:50.574
(groans)

36:52.510 --> 36:53.610
(man growls in arabic)

36:55.346 --> 36:56.613
(gunfire)

36:57.682 --> 36:58.648
Tony!

36:58.650 --> 36:59.783
Tony:
Ziva!

36:59.785 --> 37:01.384
I was just about
to make my move.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.220
I know.
We have to get back to cover.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.454
Come on!
(groans):
Oh, god!

37:04.456 --> 37:06.323
Let's get out of here.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.724
No, there are more coming.
Many more.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.561
(alarm buzzes, latches clanking)

37:11.563 --> 37:12.896
What was that?

37:12.898 --> 37:15.699
I'm pretty sure all the
cell doors just unlocked.

37:15.701 --> 37:16.766
Come on.

37:18.302 --> 37:19.736
(groaning in pain)

37:20.638 --> 37:21.938
They're coming.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.974
You have to protect me;
I have rights.

37:23.976 --> 37:26.309
Right now, you have
the right to remain silent!

37:26.311 --> 37:27.010
Ow!

37:27.012 --> 37:28.345
I'm sorry, tony!

37:28.347 --> 37:29.546
If I die,

37:29.548 --> 37:30.680
They'll have your badge.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.716
I'm more concerned
about my life.

37:32.718 --> 37:33.717
Seconded.

37:33.719 --> 37:34.851
We have eight shots left.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.653
Should be enough
for an angry mob, right?

37:36.655 --> 37:38.955
Maybe they didn't
see us.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.590
(pounding, men yelling)

37:40.592 --> 37:41.725
Code blue! Seal it off!

37:41.727 --> 37:43.026
Gibbs: Go! Get back,
get back, get back!

37:43.028 --> 37:44.294
Turn on the suction!

37:48.866 --> 37:50.300
(muffled explosion)

37:51.736 --> 37:55.405
There must have been a secondary
spring under the flap.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.874
Maybe if I cut
the other wire.

38:07.652 --> 38:08.852
The negative
pressure in the tent

38:08.854 --> 38:10.287
Prevented anything
from escaping.

38:10.289 --> 38:11.988
We're in the clear.

38:11.990 --> 38:15.325
(phone ringing)

38:16.961 --> 38:19.029
Yeah, director?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.700
(banging,
man yelling in arabic)

38:26.504 --> 38:27.704
(grunts)

38:27.706 --> 38:29.372
He saying anything useful?

38:29.374 --> 38:31.775
He's bargaining for khan.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.076
He does not care
about us.

38:33.078 --> 38:36.379
He'll let us go if we,
if we hand him over.

38:36.381 --> 38:37.814
Not funny.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.050
It's not a bad deal, tony.
Come on.

38:40.052 --> 38:42.352
(banging, men yelling continue)

38:42.354 --> 38:43.920
Tony:
Wait a second.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.456
You want to just
make a deal with this guy?

38:46.458 --> 38:47.791
I mean, what's stopping him

38:47.793 --> 38:49.459
From killing us
after we give him khan?

38:49.461 --> 38:50.460
Nothing.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.795
But it's worth a try.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.563
You two are sick.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.398
At least we will not
have to spend

38:55.400 --> 38:57.734
The last moments of our lives
with him whining!

38:57.736 --> 38:59.836
(banging, yelling continue)

38:59.838 --> 39:02.005
Sold.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.740
No, you can't,
you can't do that!

39:03.742 --> 39:04.808
You need me!

39:04.810 --> 39:06.776
Why? You have been
of no use to us.

39:07.878 --> 39:09.579
Okay, let's do this.

39:09.581 --> 39:10.714
(groans)

39:10.716 --> 39:11.915
Tony...

39:11.917 --> 39:13.783
Don't.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.385
Tony, don't!

39:15.387 --> 39:17.020
Okay, ziva, you open
the door a little bit,

39:17.022 --> 39:18.922
We toss him
in the hall,

39:18.924 --> 39:20.590
Close it fast--
on three.
No.

39:20.592 --> 39:24.027
Two!
No, no, I'll tell you
whatever you want!

39:24.029 --> 39:25.795
I'll tell you whatever you want.

39:28.466 --> 39:29.532
Prove it.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.104
(phone rings)

39:34.106 --> 39:35.939
Tony (over phone):
Mcgee, get ready to listen.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.741
Tell him
how you contact mc.

39:37.743 --> 39:39.976
(pounding, yelling)
come on!
I can't hold this door anymore!

39:39.978 --> 39:41.010
Okay. Hello.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.912
I-I ping him from
a basic ip,

39:42.914 --> 39:43.913
And he contacts me.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.648
Yeah, nice try.

39:45.650 --> 39:46.983
If he's monitoring your
activity, he'll know it's us.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.385
No, he doesn't; I swear.

39:48.387 --> 39:49.753
If he's lying, mcgee,
hang up!

39:49.755 --> 39:50.754
No, wait!

39:50.756 --> 39:51.788
Cut the crap.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.590
When you hacked the mit network,

39:53.592 --> 39:56.626
You used a secure backstop
that kept you invisible.

39:56.628 --> 39:57.627
What?

39:57.629 --> 40:01.431
Yeah, but it also let you track
anyone looking for you.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.932
That's how you got in so quick,
isn't it?

40:02.934 --> 40:05.101
H-how do you
know that?

40:05.103 --> 40:07.003
You like to know
who's following you.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.773
So I'm guessing you used
the same thing on mc.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.808
Which means you know
exactly where he is.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.010
Who is this?

40:14.012 --> 40:17.414
Someone smarter than you,
who's about to hang up.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.782
Give me the numbers.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.817
(pounding and yelling
grow louder)

40:20.819 --> 40:22.719
Come on!
I can't hold the door anymore!

40:22.721 --> 40:24.854
Fine.

40:24.856 --> 40:28.024
Khan:
192-168...

40:29.560 --> 40:32.195
...014.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.197
Is that it?

40:34.199 --> 40:35.932
Mcgee, is he
messing with us?

40:35.934 --> 40:37.767
Nah, he knows better.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.035
All right,
the signal's active, tony.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.537
We can track mc.

40:40.539 --> 40:42.605
So it's hammer time?

40:42.607 --> 40:45.108
Mcgee:
Yeah, it's hammer time.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.544
Gibbs:
Yeah, mcgee?

40:47.546 --> 40:48.978
Boss, we got it.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.481
(yelling, pounding continue)

40:51.483 --> 40:53.950
(tony whistles)

40:53.952 --> 40:55.485
(yelling, pounding stop)

40:55.487 --> 40:57.086
Finally.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.855
(sighs)
hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

40:58.857 --> 41:00.957
What are you doing?!
I told you everything!

41:00.959 --> 41:02.692
And that wasn't so hard,
was it?

41:09.767 --> 41:11.734
What... The hell?

41:11.736 --> 41:13.603
You know, these squibs
really hurt.

41:13.605 --> 41:14.938
More than a pair of heels?

41:18.108 --> 41:20.109
(shouts in arabic)

41:20.111 --> 41:22.045
You can stop
the act now, kev.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.814
I only said,
"how's that for improv?"

41:24.816 --> 41:25.882
Well, it was good.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.116
It was-- you did good.

41:27.118 --> 41:31.488
(man shouting in arabic
over speakers)

41:36.527 --> 41:38.895
You mean
this whole thing was...?

41:38.897 --> 41:41.197
Old school.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.938
Heads up.

41:48.940 --> 41:50.073
Antacids.

41:50.075 --> 41:52.041
It's a little late, but thanks.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.877
Congrats, gibbs, you did it.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.545
No.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.046
It's a team effort.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.849
Yeah, yeah, I only have
one more question.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.718
Whatever happened
to khan's lawyer?

42:01.720 --> 42:03.052
He must have shown up.

42:03.054 --> 42:06.789
We told him
we transferred his client

42:06.791 --> 42:10.894
Agent dorneget drove him
all the way down to norfolk.

42:10.896 --> 42:12.762
Clerical error.

42:12.764 --> 42:16.666
You know, we're gonna have to
answer for a lot of this.

42:16.668 --> 42:18.268
Not to mention
tracking and taking down

42:18.270 --> 42:20.069
The artist
formerly known as mc.

42:20.071 --> 42:23.907
The job's never done, jerome.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.642
I know.

42:25.644 --> 42:28.177
Which is why I don't think
I'm the man for it.
