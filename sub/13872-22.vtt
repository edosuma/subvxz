00:14.217 --> 00:16.845
Samhain forever.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.767
God, the house smells awful.

01:10.673 --> 01:11.799
What?

01:12.942 --> 01:15.672
What you say? I can't
understand you.

01:18.147 --> 01:22.208
God almighty, I said 'I know".
The house smells awful..

01:22.285 --> 01:24.116
Why? Why does it smell that way?

01:24.187 --> 01:28.715
Did you have to go to that tone already?
You started off so nice.

01:28.791 --> 01:32.227
Alright, I am sorry OK.
Just explain, please. Why?

01:32.295 --> 01:33.887
So, this is what did, see?

01:33.963 --> 01:36.796
You know how the flies
have been a problem?

01:37.200 --> 01:38.260
No, I don't.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.794
Remember when I left all the meat out...

01:39.869 --> 01:43.236
...because I saw Mr. David
Lynch I am on TV do it...

01:43.306 --> 01:45.240
...and he got on
TV for doing it...

01:45.308 --> 01:47.776
...and I did it and I didn't
get on TV for doing it?

01:47.844 --> 01:49.641
- No I don't remmber that.
- Well, I did.

01:49.712 --> 01:52.943
Because of this of
course, you get rats.

01:53.616 --> 01:56.084
- So, why does the house smell?
- I am not done.

01:56.152 --> 02:00.088
Look, when we go in there, you
need to watch where you step.

02:00.156 --> 02:01.748
And why is that?

02:03.893 --> 02:06.737
That is part of the reason. Now, let's
just go in. And Remember what I said.

02:06.973 --> 02:09.889
- Meatwad, are you OK?
- Boy, got the whole hallway mined.

02:09.966 --> 02:12.093
- What is the deal?
- What the hell happened here?

02:12.168 --> 02:13.499
It's all for nothing now.

02:13.569 --> 02:15.753
I got rid of that stupid
fireplace and now...

02:15.754 --> 02:17.938
...the room has a
flow.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.032
- You feel it?
- We never had a fireplace.

02:20.109 --> 02:22.839
- We never used it.
- We never had one.

02:22.912 --> 02:24.277
I never liked it.

02:24.347 --> 02:26.247
You should see what
he did to your room.

02:26.315 --> 02:28.715
- What do you mean? What did he do to my room?
- I will lead the way.

02:28.785 --> 02:30.810
- Meatwad, lead the way.
- OK

02:30.887 --> 02:33.412
Damn! Again.

02:34.190 --> 02:36.124
Save some for the rats, huh?

02:36.192 --> 02:38.717
We are only friggin' infested with 'em.

02:38.795 --> 02:40.319
- What's the deal here?
- Hang on.

02:40.396 --> 02:43.559
Some of us has to walk there
'cause we can't float.

02:43.633 --> 02:45.624
What did you do to my room?

02:45.701 --> 02:48.295
Let's you and I examine
the video feed, huh?

02:49.005 --> 02:50.802
See all these video monitors?

02:50.873 --> 02:54.274
Is exactly how bedrooms
are set up in space.

02:54.343 --> 02:58.302
Good god. Look at all of this garbage
all over my bed, my books, my equipments.

02:58.381 --> 03:02.875
Yes. Mostly concentrated in the
lower section of quadrant A.

03:02.952 --> 03:04.476
What? My computer?

03:04.554 --> 03:08.320
Yes. Those are laymen
terms of course, but yes.

03:08.391 --> 03:11.121
- See, I put that there.
-  And why is that?

03:13.095 --> 03:15.689
Look, you can see it from
three different angles.

03:15.765 --> 03:16.993
Where are you going?

03:17.066 --> 03:19.500
-  Zoom in?
- Don't bother. We are done.

03:19.569 --> 03:21.901
Hold on. Where you going?
I am gonna edit this.

03:21.971 --> 03:25.202
You just have fun watching it by yourself
because we are done being roomates...

03:25.274 --> 03:26.340
...and we are done being friends.

03:26.341 --> 03:27.606
Look, I had to do that.

03:27.677 --> 03:30.009
You'll understand one
day, when you are older.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.309
I will send a crew for my stuff later.
See ya..

03:32.381 --> 03:36.715
I can just delcare this space as a loss
on the taxes I will pay in August.

03:36.786 --> 03:40.244
Are you listening to me?
August is when I do it.

03:40.323 --> 03:42.917
- He is gone.
- Who cares. Change all the locks.

03:42.992 --> 03:46.086
Ok but look. Make sure you
stay away from these...

03:46.162 --> 03:48.027
...'cause just look
when I do this...

03:48.364 --> 03:49.456
Damn!

03:51.400 --> 03:53.368
Thanks for moving me, Carl.

03:53.436 --> 03:56.030
Thanks for leaving. When are
the other two showing up?

03:56.105 --> 03:57.299
They are not.

03:57.373 --> 03:59.864
- What do you mean? They are not?
- Oh, you didn't know.

03:59.942 --> 04:02.376
They are staying back at
the house, next to you.

04:02.445 --> 04:05.471
It's not exactly what
we agreed upon, is it?

04:05.548 --> 04:08.608
Well, I lied. But here is that
candycane I promised you.

04:08.684 --> 04:10.413
No no no. Save it for Christmas.

04:10.486 --> 04:13.614
Shove it right back up your ass.
I will see you never.

04:13.689 --> 04:16.317
Wait. whoa whoa whoa. Wait a minute, Carl.
I will see you this weekend, right?

04:16.392 --> 04:18.291
I mean, it's condo warming party.

04:18.293 --> 04:20.192
We gonna get all crazy up in here.

04:20.262 --> 04:22.731
- What? You gonna have girls here?
- Do you know any?

04:22.932 --> 04:25.833
Alright, throw that chicken
right down the middle.

04:25.902 --> 04:27.995
It's gonna go right out
of the park, baby.

04:28.070 --> 04:30.402
Alright, Where is the strike zone?

04:30.473 --> 04:31.838
Over here. Follow my voice.

04:31.908 --> 04:34.672
I can't see. I got some sort of
chicken infection in my eyes.

04:34.744 --> 04:38.009
Alright. Fine. Go down the
hallway and wash it out.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.208
No sir. I ain't never going
down that hallway never again.

04:41.284 --> 04:42.979
Did you pitch that chicken?

04:45.021 --> 04:48.286
Hey Shake, how you doing? I just...

04:51.127 --> 04:53.493
Why are you here? Do you
need money or something?

04:53.563 --> 04:55.360
Who is at the door? Describe him to me.

04:55.431 --> 04:57.456
I just wanted to invite
you guys to the party.

04:57.533 --> 05:00.434
- Condo warming party I am having.
- A party. Yeah, rich.

05:00.503 --> 05:02.664
That's a crackerjack.
Listen, I won't be going.

05:02.738 --> 05:04.296
I don't think Meatwad will either.

05:04.373 --> 05:07.171
Meatwad, a begger is
here for some money.

05:07.243 --> 05:09.234
Please shoe him what
you use for money..

05:09.312 --> 05:11.439
Hey Meatwad. What's wrong with your eye?

05:11.514 --> 05:14.449
- Got me a chicken infection.
- And that's perfectly alright.

05:14.517 --> 05:16.109
He wanted it and I said sure.

05:16.218 --> 05:19.984
Things have been fine since you left, you
know. He has actually gotten better.

05:20.056 --> 05:21.923
Maybe I should bring you
some penicillin, Meatwad.

05:22.176 --> 05:23.880
Or at least, take it to
the doctor, get looked at.

05:23.926 --> 05:27.726
We don't need your black magic from
the witch doctor in your city.

05:27.797 --> 05:31.392
- But your bike is pretty nice.
- Yeah. I actually joined a club.

05:31.467 --> 05:33.697
We go upstate to go trail
riding in the weekend.

05:33.769 --> 05:37.205
You go riding with nature, and
fresh air, and no raw chicken?

05:37.273 --> 05:39.468
I wanna join this club.
Can I join your club?

05:39.542 --> 05:41.806
Chickens are a vital link of nature's chain...

05:41.877 --> 05:44.903
...and that's why we use them to
play chicken ball in the house.

05:44.981 --> 05:48.781
Now, if you will excuse us, you
have rudely interrupted our dinner.

05:48.851 --> 05:49.875
Hang on...

05:50.519 --> 05:52.953
- What dinner?
- I don't know. Where is yours?

05:53.022 --> 05:54.614
Because this is my mustard.

05:54.757 --> 05:57.658
Fryman, you are back.
Hey, what are you doing?

05:57.727 --> 06:01.458
Are you back for good? Are you moving in?
What's the story here?

06:01.530 --> 06:03.794
- Just visiting, Carl.
- Look, don't breath in.

06:03.866 --> 06:05.834
Something's wrong with
the air since you left.

06:05.901 --> 06:08.563
My eyes. Is this nromal?
No, it is not.

06:08.638 --> 06:10.936
- Which one?
- Oh, they are both bad now?

06:11.007 --> 06:12.201
- Come on!
- Batter!

06:12.274 --> 06:16.108
- I know I was feeling tingling over there.
- Oh, that's just my conjuntivitis.

06:16.178 --> 06:18.442
Standard reaction to raw chicken and...

06:18.514 --> 06:21.347
Styroform burning. Yeah, that's
how they keep warm over there.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.510
Oh man, look at that cloud.
That ain't normal.

06:23.586 --> 06:25.781
No, it's not. Well,
see you at my party.

06:25.855 --> 06:28.585
Don't go, Come back. I need you.

06:28.658 --> 06:30.990
Need perscription or something.
Where are you?

06:33.095 --> 06:37.623
<i>I would love to make your
party but no can do..</i>

06:37.700 --> 06:40.863
<i>I am having my butt removed.</i>

06:41.437 --> 06:43.029
<i>Plus, I am sick.</i>

06:43.439 --> 06:46.272
<i>My grandmother is sick too. See you, guy..</i>

06:46.475 --> 06:49.069
<i>Hey, it's Carl. I don't think
I will make your party, buddy.</i>

06:49.145 --> 06:52.706
<i>My eyes have closed completely
now and police do not care..</i>

06:52.782 --> 06:55.751
<i>But if you can see the
phne, please hit 911.</i>

06:56.285 --> 06:58.947
<i>Frylock, we will be at
your party at 7:00.</i>

06:59.021 --> 07:02.422
<i>Do you need us to bring anything
or can we have money for a taxi?</i>

07:02.491 --> 07:04.857
<i>I told you not to call
him. Get off that phone.</i>

07:04.927 --> 07:07.418
<i>- Pleaser, Frylock,  I can't see!</i>

07:09.899 --> 07:13.494
Hey Jay, what's happening? You came.
Did you bring your toga?

07:14.503 --> 07:15.970
- Am I late?
- I don't think so.

07:16.038 --> 07:18.632
- It goes on until question mark.
- Yeah. I saw that.

07:18.708 --> 07:21.677
- Who know when that is , right?
- I got a message from my wife.

07:21.744 --> 07:24.679
If it's cool with you, could you
just stay away from our dog...

07:24.747 --> 07:26.164
... and our children
and our apartment?

07:26.165 --> 07:27.181
Why?

07:27.249 --> 07:29.911
- Did something happen?
- No. No.

07:29.985 --> 07:32.977
Iit's not, you know, it's not you. It's
the fact that people see us with you.

07:33.055 --> 07:35.785
- it is what it is
- you want a beer? For the road?

07:35.858 --> 07:37.655
- No no. I got to go.
- I will let you pour it.

07:37.727 --> 07:40.195
No thanks. We've got some human
beings coming over...

07:40.262 --> 07:42.253
...and we are going to
do human being stuff.So,

07:42.331 --> 07:44.322
You know, stay away.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.027
Damn. This sucks.

07:51.941 --> 07:54.000
<i>- Hey, what's up?
- Welcome to the Rock!</i>

07:54.076 --> 07:57.477
<i>- What are you all doing tonight?
- Well I wonder who wants to know.</i>

07:57.546 --> 08:01.107
Alright, look. I know we had a lot
of differences in your past but...

08:01.183 --> 08:03.117
<i>But what? I have hacked into your mind.</i>

08:03.185 --> 08:05.517
<i>Having a party and
no one's showing up.</i>

08:05.588 --> 08:07.283
No. But how did you know that?

08:07.356 --> 08:09.273
<i>Sadness surrounds us, doesn't it, Err?</i>

08:09.274 --> 08:11.190
Sadness is for poor people!

08:11.260 --> 08:14.957
<i>We may be able to squeeze by but
we can't promise anything.</i>

08:15.030 --> 08:16.497
<i>- We are busy.
- Busy.</i>

08:16.565 --> 08:19.591
<i>Because on the moon, our
weekends are far advanced....</i>

08:19.668 --> 08:20.900
<i>...they encompass
the entire weekend.</i>

08:20.901 --> 08:21.932
<i>That is right.</i>

08:22.004 --> 08:24.666
<i>Jobs have been phased
out by our minds.</i>

08:24.740 --> 08:27.607
<i>We get checks from the government
and we spend it on beers!</i>

08:27.676 --> 08:30.110
<i>- Mexican beer.
- That is the cheapest of all beers..</i>

08:30.179 --> 08:33.342
You know I got some beer here
and a few chicken wings...

08:33.982 --> 08:34.982
Is that right?

08:35.049 --> 08:37.041
- This is mine.
- See you in hell.

08:37.119 --> 08:39.553
- Yeah, give him the finger.
- Damn.

08:40.356 --> 08:42.984
He could have at least stayed
and talked for a minute.

08:43.058 --> 08:44.355
Talk to the can!

08:45.761 --> 08:47.888
Damn it. Get the
hell out of here.

08:52.768 --> 08:54.633
Hey hey. What's up with the ambulance?

08:54.703 --> 08:58.867
Meatwad, it's for you. Someone
who thinks he is your friend.

08:58.941 --> 09:00.670
Bring him over to the light.

09:00.743 --> 09:02.472
Meatwad, how are you doing?

09:02.672 --> 09:06.410
Oh, Frylock, hey. Hey I am very... 
Can I tell you the truth?

09:06.482 --> 09:08.279
- Meatwad!
- I am very good.

09:08.350 --> 09:11.649
If you are that good then, maybe you
should be putting some foam on our fire.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.483
I am not an Eskimo
over here, you know.

09:13.556 --> 09:15.148
Your face looks all puffy.

09:15.224 --> 09:19.058
No no. I am just tired. I
fell down some stairs.

09:19.128 --> 09:20.322
We don't have any
stairs, Meatwad.

09:20.396 --> 09:23.092
He says he fell down some stairs.
He fell down some stairs.

09:23.165 --> 09:24.894
People get clumsy sometimes.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.834
- Is there a problem here?
- He is sick, Shake. And so are you.

09:27.903 --> 09:31.771
Well, he is supposed to be next door,
harvesting the crops, picking our dinner.

09:31.841 --> 09:35.208
See, we are farming now. We are farmers.
It's an honest life.

09:35.277 --> 09:38.906
We ain't got no holler leaves over there.
We ate that whole bush yesterday.

09:38.981 --> 09:40.642
That's why the
bathroom hurts so bad.

09:40.716 --> 09:43.685
- What else did you plant over there?
- I ain't planting nothing.

09:43.752 --> 09:46.915
That's why you fall down
the stairs all the time.

09:47.256 --> 09:49.690
Are both the little
burritos you used to make?

09:49.758 --> 09:50.758
Burritos?

09:50.826 --> 09:52.418
- Well, they are spring rolls
- Give me those!

09:52.494 --> 09:54.587
I also bought some ointment for your eyes.

09:54.663 --> 09:57.029
- Give em that ointment.
-  And some vitamin C.

09:57.099 --> 09:59.533
- No, Meatwad, It's for your eyes.
-  I ain't eating anything right now.

09:59.602 --> 10:02.594
I need something in my stomach.
Frylock, these are good.

10:02.671 --> 10:05.037
Remember when we used to
make these every Thrusday?

10:05.107 --> 10:06.734
You know, burritos Thrusday

10:06.809 --> 10:10.108
- Yeah, they are spring rolls though.
- They are good.

10:10.179 --> 10:14.115
-Where is everybody?
- This has gone well.

10:14.383 --> 10:16.681
I will tell you what. Hold on.

10:17.086 --> 10:21.386
We will allow visitation
hours for you and us...

10:21.457 --> 10:25.860
...provided you bring lunch of
these little fried burritos.

10:27.263 --> 10:30.198
- Well, no, I will see you all later.
- No, wait wait wait. Hang on.

10:30.266 --> 10:33.030
And you pay us a stipend.

10:33.102 --> 10:35.536
- Fu**k you, Shake. See you.
- No no no. Wait wait wait. Hang on.

10:35.604 --> 10:39.506
