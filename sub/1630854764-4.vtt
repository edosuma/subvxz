00:43.085 --> 00:44.253

00:44.253 --> 00:46.088

01:01.144 --> 01:03.230
It's a huge hit in Italy.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.191
Well, thanks so much, guys.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.568
Wish me luck?
- Oh, you don't need it.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.778
- You got this.
- Woo!

01:11.864 --> 01:14.324
I am so, so excited for her!

01:14.324 --> 01:16.952
Me, too! She is crushing it.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.704
- Killing it.
- Murdered it.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.747
It is dead.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.916
I couldn't be happier for her.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.923
Even though, you know,

01:29.923 --> 01:32.968
we've been in New York <i>way</i>, way longer,
and our careers are--

01:32.968 --> 01:34.428
- Trash.
- Trainwrecks.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.889
Full-on flaming garbage.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.267
Hey, you know what we need?

01:41.268 --> 01:43.103
A little Pathetic Deirdre.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.314
Oh, my God, yes.

01:45.314 --> 01:48.150
Pathetic Deirdre!

01:48.859 --> 01:50.986
Okay, so I realize

01:50.986 --> 01:53.488
this is maybe not
the best look for me.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.699
SOPHIE'S SON [on phone]:
<i>You and Aunt Val laughing maniacally</i>

01:55.699 --> 01:58.493
<i>about some poor woman
named "Pathetic Deirdre"?</i>

01:58.493 --> 02:00.412
<i>Yeah, it's not great.</i>

02:00.412 --> 02:01.955
Well, just let me explain.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.209
Deirdre was an old college friend,

02:05.209 --> 02:08.378
and Aunt Val and I used to invite her
to brunch when we were feeling,

02:08.378 --> 02:11.798
you know, low,
to give ourselves an ego boost.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.967
This city is just too loud for me.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.053
I'm gonna move to New Jersey.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.555
<i>New Jersey. On purpose!</i>

02:20.516 --> 02:22.601
I don't know how you two party so much.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.603
I'm usually in bed by 9:00.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.314
<i>I haven't gone to bed at 9:00
since I was 9.</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:30.359
I'm thinking about writing a book.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.818
Like, about my life.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.989
Who would read that?

02:37.324 --> 02:39.826
Wouldn't. Who wouldn't read that?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.120
Wait.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.123
Val, is this gross?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.667
We're 30 now.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.335
We support other women.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.338
It's fine. We're just
reaching out to an old friend

02:51.338 --> 02:53.048
to see if she wants to have brunch.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.551
Something women have done
throughout herstory.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.761
You're right.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.305
Should we call her first
to make sure she doesn't have other plans?

03:04.309 --> 03:06.520
SOPHIE'S SON: <i>Mom!</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:08.605
You don't get it!

03:08.605 --> 03:11.108
She <i>never</i> had anything going on!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.946
Okay, babe, are you ready to do this?

03:15.946 --> 03:17.281
Almost. How's my hair?

03:17.281 --> 03:19.408
Oh, it's so cute.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.329
Oh hey, man. You don't mind if Meredith
and I shoot a video in here, do you?

03:24.329 --> 03:25.622
Oh yeah, it's for my social.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.958
Gotta let the M-heads know that
Jesse and I are back together,

03:27.958 --> 03:29.459
and he's joining me on tour.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.627
M-heads?

03:30.627 --> 03:33.338
Meredith heads. M-heads!

03:34.923 --> 03:37.759
Yeah. My whole album
is about our breakup,

03:37.759 --> 03:39.261
and so us getting back together

03:39.261 --> 03:42.014
is gonna be pretty big news
in the Memmunity.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.683
The Meredith community.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.102
Okay, well,

03:47.102 --> 03:49.146
I'm gonna need some immunity
from the Memmunity

03:49.146 --> 03:51.857
'cause your cuteness is <i>killing me.</i>

03:51.857 --> 03:53.442
Oh, awesome.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.028
Exciting news, boss man.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.739
I started dating again.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.617
Obviously, by dating, I mean hardcore,

04:01.617 --> 04:03.577
no-strings-attached doinking.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.204
That is right.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.956
Yours truly hooked up with
a comely young lady last night,

04:07.956 --> 04:09.708
and it was luscious.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.543
Okay. Congratulations, Charlie,

04:11.543 --> 04:13.670
but please do not use the words,

04:13.670 --> 04:17.216
"doinking" or "luscious"
or "comely" again.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.550
Noted.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.847
What on Earth are they doing
with their noses?

04:23.847 --> 04:26.517
They are happy, and they're in love,

04:26.517 --> 04:28.352
and though we have our <i>misgivings</i>,

04:28.352 --> 04:30.687
Jesse is our best friend,
so we support him.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.192
What I supported last night
was the full weight of a human woman.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.320
The more you talk,
the more you sound like a murderer.

05:14.523 --> 05:15.607
Ellen Gilbert.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.526
It's my first day, and I need a...

05:17.526 --> 05:19.194
pass! Pass! Pass!

05:21.780 --> 05:24.283
Oh! Can you make it fast, fast, fast?

05:24.283 --> 05:26.952
Sorry, I just wanna hop
on the elevator with my boss.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.787
You sure?

05:28.787 --> 05:31.957
The elevator is a very small space
for your boss to be alone with...

05:31.957 --> 05:33.000
all of this.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.461
Stairs it is!

05:37.921 --> 05:39.840
I'll get my steps in.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.677
51st floor?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.847
That's a no-go for old Ellen-o.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.855
Soph! Deirdre texted back!

05:55.939 --> 05:57.983
"Sorry, lovelies, can't brunch today.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.736
I have a book reading
at The Ginz in 30 minutes."

06:00.736 --> 06:02.821
A book reading?
What does that even mean?

06:03.322 --> 06:05.157
Maybe it auto-corrected "foot cleaning"?

06:05.157 --> 06:08.994
Oh... I bet it's like a open mic thing.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.746
We <i>have</i> to go.

06:10.746 --> 06:11.997
Already requesting a Lyft.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.838
This can't all be
for Deirdre's thing.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.424
Uh, excuse me. Is there another smaller,

06:22.424 --> 06:25.052
sadder event happening here today?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.720
Nope. Just the one book reading.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.181
She's here!

06:32.226 --> 06:33.644
Hold on.

06:35.771 --> 06:39.441
Did Pathetic Deirdre write an actual book?

06:39.441 --> 06:41.151
I bet it's mostly pictures.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.570
No. Words. It's all words.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.365
Huh? Wait,
is that how you spell "Deirdre"?

06:46.365 --> 06:47.950
English is weird.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.499
My God, she always talked
about writing a book,

06:55.499 --> 06:58.502
and now, she's written a book?
That's so random.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.463
Val.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.758
Look at this chapter.
"Mimosas and Mind Games"?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.136
We always used to have mimosas with her.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.513
I think this book is about us.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.516
Stop. You're being paranoid.
Let's dive right in.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.769
"In college, I met two women,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.896
and I became 'friendly' with them."

07:18.397 --> 07:20.732
- Could be anyone.
- "To preserve their privacy,

07:20.732 --> 07:23.318
I will call them Sophia and Valerie."

07:23.318 --> 07:25.696
Okay, it's us.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.867
Well, I will put your contact in
as first name, "the,"

07:29.867 --> 07:32.828
last name,
"most beautiful girl in the world."

07:36.039 --> 07:38.417
You know, I'm so happy
I sprung for the 12-pack

07:38.417 --> 07:41.420
from Baskets USA
because looks like,

07:41.420 --> 07:44.047
I'll be sending another one
out tomorrow morning.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.717
Did you send your hookup
a post-sex breakup gift basket?

07:46.717 --> 07:47.676
Of course.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.721
It's what Derek Jeter did in his prime.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.807
Who knows how to do classy,
casual sex in New York City

07:53.807 --> 07:56.560
better than noted American sex Yankee
Derek Jeter?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.187
That is an old rumor.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.147
Jeter himself said it's not true.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.232
Jeter, you discreet devil.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.902
He will take his basketing secrets
to the grave.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.654
Okay, there are a couple things
to hit in this video.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.115
So I made some bullet points.
- What? No, babe.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.451
You know why they're called
"bullet points"?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.119
They shoot spontaneity dead.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.039
I think we should just wing it.
- Uh, okay.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.709
Hey, guys! I have a huge announcement.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.836
Guess who's joining me on tour?
- It's me--

08:22.836 --> 08:24.755
Jesse! That's right! Jesse,

08:24.755 --> 08:27.633
the inspiration behind <i>Jay Street.</i>

08:27.633 --> 08:30.469
We are back together and so happy.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.222
- That's right--
- I can't wait to see you all on tour

08:33.222 --> 08:35.891
and share our love story with you.

08:35.891 --> 08:39.811
Dates below, and we added a second night
in Myrtle Beach.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.607
Go, cocks! Quack, quack, quack! Peace!
- We-- We love... cocks.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.735
Okay. I think that's pretty good.
Should I post it?

08:46.735 --> 08:50.155
Uh, I-I-I don't know. You know,
that kind of felt a little bit more like

08:50.155 --> 08:52.449
a solo than a, than a duet to me, but...

08:52.449 --> 08:55.744
Really? Okay, we can do another one.
It's funny.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.579
Felt like <i>you</i> were talking a lot.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.543
Hello, Courtney.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.627
You're here.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.671
Um...

09:06.547 --> 09:09.132
Courtney, this is Sid.
Sid, this is Courtney, my, um--

09:09.132 --> 09:11.218
His hookup from last night.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.554
Sorry for the ambush.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.722
I usually play it cool,

09:15.722 --> 09:17.558
but I thought, what the hell?

09:17.558 --> 09:20.143
Charlie's putting himself
out there by sending me this

09:20.143 --> 09:21.854
"I like you" gift basket.

09:21.854 --> 09:24.857
Might as well let him know
I like him, too.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.367
Wool suit. Wool suit!

10:12.571 --> 10:17.284
Think.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.661
There's gotta be a way outta here.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.737

10:53.737 --> 10:56.448
"Yet, every time little blond Sophia

10:56.448 --> 10:59.284
"and her fiery sidekick Valerie called,

10:59.284 --> 11:00.619
I couldn't resist."

11:00.619 --> 11:02.996
So, I'm a sidekick now?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.958
And she called you fiery,
which is hella problematic.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.793
- I hate Pathetic Deirdre.
- Yeah, well,

11:07.793 --> 11:10.504
she clearly hates us, too,
and with good reason.

11:10.504 --> 11:14.299
We were such passive-aggressive
mean girls to her.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.219
Yeah, true.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.930
Do you wanna
stick around and apologize,

11:19.930 --> 11:23.183
do the right thing?
- No! Let's get outta here.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.814
Oh, my God!

11:29.815 --> 11:33.569
I can't believe it,
but the real Valerie and Sophia are here.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.739
This is so brave of you both.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.533
Please, come join me!

11:39.533 --> 11:41.618
Together, we can heal.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.245
Come on. Come on.

11:43.245 --> 11:44.872
Let's support them. This isn't easy.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.249
I can't believe this is how
we get canceled.

11:47.249 --> 11:50.294
I can't believe Deirdre
chose <i>that</i> as her author photo.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.379
Stop it.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.090
I'm sorry.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.509
Wait, w-why are you sorry?

11:57.509 --> 11:58.969
Isn't it obvious?

11:58.969 --> 12:01.763
I used you to make myself feel better.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.473
Before I she-toxed,

12:03.473 --> 12:06.894
I thought of you two
as my pathetic friends.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.821
How's it going over there, sex Yankee?

12:17.821 --> 12:20.824
It's great, actually.
I really misjudged Courtney.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.201
I mean, she's lovely.

12:22.201 --> 12:24.244
She's funny. She's really smart.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.455
She's actually a genius.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.207
At the Apple Store.

12:28.207 --> 12:31.043
I'm really glad that she mistook my
"thanks for the hookup" basket

12:31.043 --> 12:33.295
for a "let's go on a real date" basket.

12:33.295 --> 12:36.256
Again, neither of those
are reason to send a woman

12:36.256 --> 12:38.008
salami and lotion.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.885
You know, poor Hannah.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.762
Clearly stuck in a basket-less marriage.

12:43.972 --> 12:47.559
So, we just cannot wait
to be up on that stage

12:47.559 --> 12:50.395
performing together for all of you.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.856
Babe, do you wanna say a few words?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.149
Yes, I do. Thank you.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.943
Um, being apart from Meredith

12:55.943 --> 12:57.986
was the most difficult time of my life.

12:57.986 --> 13:01.156
And I'm just so glad that she
asked me to get back together.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.617
That's right. I took him back.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.953
Well, actually, I-I took her back.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.621
Best decision I ever made.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.083
...was being taken back by <i>me</i>

13:11.083 --> 13:14.169
because <i>I</i> took him back.
I'm the taker.

13:14.169 --> 13:18.048
Well, actually, <i>you</i> were taken. By me.

13:19.675 --> 13:21.677
Ow! Damn it!

13:21.677 --> 13:23.387
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine! Why?

13:25.764 --> 13:27.015
No reason.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.476
Dude, she's gonna ruin his life again.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.854
I know it.
And just like these wine glasses,

13:31.854 --> 13:34.147
I'ma be left to pick up the pieces.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.442
Is that why you broke the glasses?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.820
For the metaphor?

13:40.404 --> 13:41.989
Ooh, what a showman.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.455
Wait, <i>you</i> think <i>we're</i> the pathetic ones?

13:51.290 --> 13:54.459
Did you not <i>read</i> the book?
You're what I called

13:54.459 --> 13:56.003
my "could be worse-ies"

13:56.003 --> 13:57.921
because whenever I was
feeling bad about myself,

13:57.921 --> 14:00.048
I would hang out with you
and think it could--

14:00.048 --> 14:01.425
- We get it!
- Oh, we get it, Deirdre!

14:01.425 --> 14:03.844
I know. I am not proud of it,

14:03.844 --> 14:06.221
but there was a time in my life

14:06.221 --> 14:07.556
where your many,

14:07.556 --> 14:09.266
<i>many</i> struggles

14:09.266 --> 14:10.809
were like my fuel.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.812
I just bought a condo in Hoboken.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.814
Huge with waterfront views.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.443
You two still in that
tiny walk-up in Queens?

14:19.443 --> 14:21.403
Mm-hmm.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.488
I'm training for a Spartan race,

14:23.488 --> 14:26.742
so I'm eating really clean
and in bed by 9:00.

14:26.742 --> 14:27.910
More bacon?

14:27.910 --> 14:30.162
- Mm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:30.162 --> 14:33.207
I just got an advance on my memoir.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.416
Oh!

14:34.416 --> 14:37.044
You're making furniture now? Hm.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.589
Oh, sweetie, you're thinking of armoire.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.591
Oh...

14:43.550 --> 14:45.719
That is not what happened at all.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.848
They're processing.
It's perfectly healthy.

14:49.848 --> 14:53.936
I am so sorry for exploiting
your <i>many</i> struggles.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.563
<i>Mea culpa,</i> Sophie. <i>Mea culpa,</i> Valentina.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.233
No, you may not <i>culpa</i>, Deirdre.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.777
<i>You</i> were the pathetic one.

15:01.777 --> 15:02.903
Wait, what?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.988
We called you Pathetic Deirdre.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.990
<i>That</i> was your name. See?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.993
Wow! Okay.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.870
Um, She-Toxers!

15:11.870 --> 15:14.873
What we're seeing here
is a textbook case

15:14.873 --> 15:16.667
of toxic twisting.

15:16.667 --> 15:20.337
I think it is clear which of us up here

15:20.337 --> 15:21.964
was "the P word." I mean,

15:21.964 --> 15:23.841
you two could <i>barely</i> afford brunch,

15:23.841 --> 15:25.759
and I bought a condo when I was 25!

15:25.759 --> 15:29.471
Uh, a condo in Jersey, so...

15:29.471 --> 15:31.223
Uh, doesn't count.

15:31.223 --> 15:34.101
Don't laugh at that!

15:34.101 --> 15:36.937
At least I am not broke and day drunk.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.815
We are not day drunk! Yet.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.567
Yeah, and you know what?

15:41.567 --> 15:45.028
We might not have some fancy
book with <i>no</i> pictures in it, okay?

15:45.028 --> 15:46.488
But we have each other.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.615
Oh, good for you!

15:48.615 --> 15:51.159
You two are so goddamn annoying!

15:53.328 --> 15:56.707
...is what pre-she-tox Deirdre
would have said.

15:56.707 --> 16:00.252
She's a fraud! She's still toxic!

16:00.252 --> 16:04.131
No! No, no, no, no, no.
I have changed, I swear.

16:04.131 --> 16:07.593
I just find these two <i>very</i> triggering.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.887
So now she's using
the word "triggering"

16:09.887 --> 16:12.931
to justify her bad behavior. We hate that!

16:15.767 --> 16:18.979
Ooh... We are not canceled,

16:18.979 --> 16:20.272
but Pathetic Deirdre is.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.901
You wanna go get day drunk?
- Yeah.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.487
- Bye, D.
- Eh!

16:27.487 --> 16:29.489
Good to see you!
- Uh-huh!

16:34.244 --> 16:36.872
<i>♪ When I crawl through the vent ♪</i>

16:36.872 --> 16:40.000
<i>♪ It's like, ooh, there she went ♪</i>

16:42.836 --> 16:44.338
Goddammit!

16:46.798 --> 16:47.883
Oh, my God.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.135
That's my meeting.

16:50.135 --> 16:53.138
Okay, first thing's first.
Let's take attendance.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.890
Kyle?
- Here.

16:55.599 --> 16:56.600
Ellen.

16:59.061 --> 16:59.603
Here.

17:02.773 --> 17:03.524
Tomas?

17:03.941 --> 17:05.025
Yeah!

17:12.658 --> 17:14.493
Nice to meet you, Tomas.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.752
I-I don't understand.
In what world did you take me back?

17:23.752 --> 17:26.171
You came to me, told me you
regretted breaking up with me,

17:26.171 --> 17:27.840
and then asked me to go on tour with you.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.300
Okay, yeah, sure. Those are the facts,

17:30.300 --> 17:32.511
but, like, what were the vibes?

17:32.511 --> 17:34.847
Okay, okay. Fine.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.598
You took me back.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.100
But,

17:38.100 --> 17:40.561
this album, the tour,

17:40.561 --> 17:42.145
even this video,

17:42.145 --> 17:44.815
it isn't about what actually happened.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.609
I mean, you gotta think
about it like... this is a movie,

17:47.609 --> 17:49.027
and I'm the main character.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.114
If you're the main character, then what
does that make me? Like, an extra?

17:52.114 --> 17:53.490
No.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.704
Makes you the extremely
handsome love interest.

18:00.789 --> 18:03.584
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're right. You're right.

18:03.584 --> 18:05.169
Let's just go with the first video.

18:05.169 --> 18:06.670
- Really?
- Yes.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.630
Okay, thank you.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.300
I'm gonna go send this to the team.

18:17.431 --> 18:19.850
- You okay?
- Wha? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.226
I'm good. I'm good. We're good.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.020
I was making too big of a deal
about that video, right?

18:23.020 --> 18:25.480
I mean, she should be the main character.
She's-- It's her tour.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.109
- Jesse.
- Yeah.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.279
Dude, Meredith's always gonna be
the main character.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.282
She's always gonna put herself first.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.492
And I-I tried to hold my tongue
'cause I know you're happy,

18:37.492 --> 18:38.827
but, dude, at the end of the day,

18:38.827 --> 18:41.246
I just think you deserve someone
who actually loves you.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.040
And Meredith doesn't.

18:46.752 --> 18:48.253
Uh, got it.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.468
So I'll, uh,
I'll see you Saturday then.

18:54.468 --> 18:57.387
I was thinking we could, uh, picnic.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.348
Well, we already have the basket, so...

18:59.890 --> 19:01.767
- You Charlie?
- Uh, yes.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.603
Got your dozen "Gourmand Paradise"
baskets from Baskets USA.

19:04.603 --> 19:06.855
You got a good deal, dude.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.232
Sign here.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.194
What's going on?

19:13.362 --> 19:15.364
It's a funny story, really. Um...

19:16.532 --> 19:19.493
Are you familiar with
New York Yankee Derek Jeter?

19:21.286 --> 19:23.288
Oh, my God.

19:23.288 --> 19:26.416
This is a
"thanks for a one-night stand" basket?

19:26.416 --> 19:27.835
Are all those other baskets for--

19:27.835 --> 19:29.419
Other women that I will meet
and sleep with, yes.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.297
You can keep your low-rent,
post-sex basket.

19:32.297 --> 19:35.092
Next time,
just ghost like a normal asshole.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.802
Low-rent?! Did you...

19:37.594 --> 19:39.596
Did you not see the truffled almonds?

19:40.013 --> 19:41.557
I slept with Jeter.

19:41.557 --> 19:44.059
<i>Real</i> truffles and a Birkin bag.

19:46.979 --> 19:49.648
A bag in a basket? He is a god.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.906
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.950
Just, uh, getting ahead
of packing for tour.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.413
Really excited to see you
at the, uh, Long Island show.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.499
Charlie and I are thinking of renting
a ZipCar and driving everyone up.

20:07.499 --> 20:10.169
We're gonna write, like,
"Jesse Express-e" on the windows.

20:10.169 --> 20:13.005
Like, all aboard the Jesse Express-e!
Woo-woo!

20:13.005 --> 20:14.882
Yeah, maybe, actually,
it's better if you don't come.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.133
Woo-- What?

20:17.134 --> 20:18.635
Really?
- Really.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.096
When I'm standing on stage
with the woman I love,

20:21.096 --> 20:22.389
I kinda wanna look into the audience

20:22.389 --> 20:24.766
and see the faces of people
who <i>actually</i> support me.

20:26.476 --> 20:27.728
Okay...

20:39.448 --> 20:40.574
Woo-woo.
