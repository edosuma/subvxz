Ever since his dad
remarried and had twins,
Alby was completely ignored.

12:19.506 --> 12:23.110
- I felt bad for him.
- Check it out, Earl.
It's a superhero mask.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.848
- The eyes are
kind of far apart.
- [ Sighs ]

12:29.282 --> 12:32.419
Oh.

12:32.452 --> 12:36.223
Look, Alby.
You can't just leave home
and come live here.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.094
The number for
George Tollhurst, please.

12:41.128 --> 12:44.431
He can live here, Earl.
We'll make him sleep sideways
at the foot of our bed.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.868
You know, to keep our toes warm.
Do you have fuzzy pajamas?

12:47.901 --> 12:51.972
Hello, Mr. Tollhurst?
Yeah, I just wanted you to know
that I've got your son.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.975
No, the other son.
No, the other son.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.077
Yeah, that's him.
He's right here and I--

12:57.110 --> 13:01.281
Hello? Hello?
Why'd you do that?

13:01.314 --> 13:03.984
I'm the last one
he thought of. I don't
want him to know where I am.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.221
[ Sighs ]

13:09.522 --> 13:11.224
Yeah, it's me again.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.526
[ George ]
I don't know who you are
or what you want,

13:13.560 --> 13:16.129
but I want you to know that
you have my full cooperation.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.131
Just don't hurt Alby.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.367
What? No, no, no, no.
I-I--

13:20.400 --> 13:23.971
You don't understand what's
going on. Alby's sitting
right next to me and he's-- Oh.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.106
I'm not going home.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.242
Alby, yes, you are.
Get back here.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.479
[ Door Slams Shut ]
[ Earl ]
Alby? Alby, open up.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.614
Is he gonna be in there
a while?
[ Pounding On Door ]

13:34.647 --> 13:38.051
I didn't have to use
the bathroom, but now that
I can't, I'm getting antsy.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.088
[ Pounding Continues ]
[ Doorknob Jiggling ]

13:41.121 --> 13:44.057
Come on, Alby.
It's been a half an hour.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.860
Enough, okay?
Come on out now.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.296
[ Alby ]
How come there's two of you,
but only one deodorant?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.198
[ Sirens Wailing ]
Oh, we're brothers,
so we share.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.567
- We do?
- Earl, the motel's on TV.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.440
[ Chattering ]

14:05.278 --> 14:07.314
[ Siren Wailing ]

14:07.347 --> 14:10.117
Oh, my God.
They think we're--

14:10.150 --> 14:12.385
I'm gonna go out
and explain everything
to 'em.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.288
I don't wanna go home.
If you go out there,
I'll tell 'em you kidnapped me.

14:15.322 --> 14:18.225
And I'll tell 'em I didn't.
Then I'll tell 'em you did.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.661
- I'll tell 'em he didn't.
- Then I'll tell 'em you put
my underwear on your head.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.064
Uh-oh.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.599
I'm sorry, Earl.
I really did think
it was a mask.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.611
Hit.
We're in hour two of
the Camden kidnapper standoff.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.514
Usually, the Palm Tree Motel
isn't known for its views,

14:41.548 --> 14:44.284
but today, there may be
a view to a kill.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.386
All right.
We gotta do somethin'.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.388
We can't just stay
locked up in here forever.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.092
Why not? It's fun.
Alby, you're not thinkin'
this thing through.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.261
How long do you think
we can stay locked up here?

14:54.294 --> 14:56.363
We don't even have any food.
Just give up.

14:59.532 --> 15:03.270
They said they're gonna kill me
if you don't give us pizza.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.406
- Alby, what are you doing?
- Tell 'em we'll still kill
you if it's not pepperoni.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.708
Randy!

15:08.741 --> 15:12.212
Okay, there's
gotta be a way.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.215
Maybe Catalina's outside
explaining that we're not
kidnappers.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.984
She knows about Alby
and my list.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.588
[ Earl Narrating ]
Unfortunately, Catalina's
an illegal immigrant...

15:21.621 --> 15:24.091
and thought all the SWAT teams
were out there for her.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.998
Hey, hey, hey.
No. That's my son
up there.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.372
Don't worry, Alby.
We're not gonna let
anything happen to you.

15:39.406 --> 15:43.176
We're not--
When we wanna use the bullhorn,
we ask to use the bullhorn.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.146
We do not snatch
the bullhorn.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.652
- See? Your dad
cares about you.
- [ Scoffs ]

15:52.685 --> 15:57.357
He's just saying that 'cause
the cameras are here. He doesn't
wanna look like a bad dad on TV.

15:57.390 --> 16:01.161
Earl, it's almost 2:00.
Can we switch the TV over
and watch Win, Lose or Draw?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.429
[ Sighs ]

16:05.498 --> 16:07.434
[ Earl Narrating ]
A simple misunderstanding
gets less simple...

16:07.467 --> 16:09.769
once you add choppers
and a SWAT team.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.671
Those guys have bazookas.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.776
I can't take it anymore.
I'm goin' out there.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.412
- I'll tell 'em
you kidnapped me.
- Fine. Say whatever you want.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.581
I'm gonna tell the truth
and take my chances.

16:21.614 --> 16:25.152
[ Reporter ] The Camden police
department has identified
the kidnapper as Earl Hickey.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.221
With me is the alleged
kidnapper's former wife,
Joy Turner.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.291
Joy, what was it like
being married to a monster?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.094
Frankly, I didn't know
he was capable of
somethin' like this.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.264
But I know earlier in
the week he was asking about
spending nights with the boy.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.466
So this was planned?

16:39.499 --> 16:42.202
But it was okay,
because the boy
was on his list.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.304
He has a list of boys?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.639
[ Joy ]
Look, before this goes
any further-- Excuse me--

16:46.673 --> 16:49.076
I just wanna say one thing.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.644
If you're lookin' for
a reasonably priced manicure
gentle enough for a woman,

16:51.678 --> 16:53.780
but man enough for a half-fruit,
call Joy's Nails.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.615
We're in the book.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.752
You know the suspect.
Do you have anything to add?

16:59.786 --> 17:04.124
Well, I-I don't know
if he's watching,
but if he is, hey, Earl!

17:05.825 --> 17:07.627
Hey, Crab Man.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.298
What I do is push
these cuticles back.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.366
That'll look
a lot more clean.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.402
Is this what you need
to be doing now?

17:15.435 --> 17:17.770
Sir, it's a waiting game.
Look, I'm tired of waiting.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.276
That's not cool, man.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.445
He's leaving.

17:25.478 --> 17:29.482
He's not even pretending
to care anymore.

17:29.516 --> 17:33.786
Alby, pretending that
you're kidnapped isn't helping
your relationship with your dad.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.657
And to be honest, it's straining
our relationship a little bit.
Will you stop poking me?

17:37.690 --> 17:41.461
I'm just trying to catch
that cool little dot
that's on your back.

Now it's on your belly.

17:43.330 --> 17:46.266

- It went away.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.303
There it is.
[ Grunts ]

17:50.337 --> 17:53.806
There's been a new development
in the child kidnapping case.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.411
The victim's father
has climbed the fire escape
to the motel roof.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.249
What is that
jackass doing?

18:06.553 --> 18:09.789
Well, I'll be damned.

[ Crowd Murmuring ]

your dad's legs on TV and
out there in real life too.

Aw.

Let's go home, Alby.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.198
Ah.
[ Chuckles ]

18:54.634 --> 18:57.170
[ Earl Narrating ]
It was hard to be upset
with Alby.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.872
He was just a kid who wanted
to know his dad loved him.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.442
Even though he could be
a pain sometimes,

19:02.475 --> 19:05.245
seein' Alby happy
made me happy too.
[ Gunshot ]

- [ Glass Shatters ]
- I just wish he was
a little quicker...

19:07.847 --> 19:10.817
- to explain our situation
to the police.
- Hey, look, Earl. Fancy smoke.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.852
Aw, it's making me sad.

It's real pretty, Earl.
See how pretty it is?

19:40.813 --> 19:44.217
Hey, Earl?
Yeah, Randy?

19:44.251 --> 19:46.853
Did you hear about me
and the Cheeto?

19:46.886 --> 19:49.889
No. What happened?
Oh, it was
pretty amazing.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.992
I was eatin' some Cheetos,
and I missed my mouth with one,

19:53.025 --> 19:55.728
and it bounced off my chin
and onto my shoulder,

19:55.762 --> 19:59.999
and then it rolled
all the way down my arm
and right back into the bag.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.735
Sounds pretty amazing.
Yeah.

20:02.769 --> 20:06.005

Good night, Earl.

20:23.323 --> 20:27.260
I made it up, Earl.
I know you did.

20:27.294 --> 20:30.463
Last year you told me
the same story about
a Good & Plenty.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.667
Be pretty cool if
it happened though.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.669
Yeah, it'd be cool.
