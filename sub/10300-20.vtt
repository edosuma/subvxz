01:04.397 --> 01:06.800
Ladies, does your husband come home
and ask you to cook...

01:07.000 --> 01:09.136
...or clean or care for the children?

01:09.336 --> 01:13.440
We at the law offices of Shirley, Janet
and Patsy can help you.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.611
We say, sue the bastard for stress.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.816
Shirley, Janet and Patsy
got me 2. 5 million.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.187
- Hi, Peg.
- Oh, hi, Al.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.056
- Want some dinner?
- Not tonight, Peg.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.024
I've learned to live on plaque.

01:32.392 --> 01:35.028
Besides, I have everything I need
right here.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.165
Oh, Al, you got Shower in a Box.

01:38.365 --> 01:42.469
No, Peg, I couldn't afford it because
years ago, I bought Wife on the Couch.

01:43.704 --> 01:48.041
Now, feast your eyes on this:
The Handyman's Workbench 5000.

01:48.242 --> 01:52.145
Oh, Al, hold me.
I want this moment to last forever.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.883
Don't worry, every moment with you
seems like it'll last forever.

01:56.083 --> 02:00.020
Oh, baby. This is gonna bring me
such pleasure.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.555
"Some assembly required."

02:01.755 --> 02:05.659
Shall I take it downstairs and put it
on the "no assembly achieved" pile?

02:06.159 --> 02:07.961
Al, why didn't you have them
assemble it for you?

02:08.161 --> 02:10.430
There, right there is what's
wrong with this country.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.199
We've become too dependent
on other people.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.368
Whatever happened to
the spirit of do-it-yourself?

02:14.568 --> 02:16.003
It's alive and well in our bedroom.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.541
Well, I, too, need something
to fiddle with.

02:20.741 --> 02:25.345
So... So if you'll excuse me,
I shall organize my tools.

02:25.546 --> 02:29.950
- Then you'll see some fixing.
- Just like you fixed the step?

02:31.885 --> 02:34.655
Of course, I could've changed
the light bulb.

02:35.289 --> 02:38.225
Mom, I heard a scream.
Did Dad fall down the stairs again?

02:38.425 --> 02:39.626
Cool.

02:42.796 --> 02:46.033
Oh, hey, Kel. What are you doing
outside fully clothed?

02:46.967 --> 02:47.968
I'm waiting for the mail.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.071
I'm expecting an invitation for Alpha.
You know, that club for smart people.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.077
Kel, you need a real high IQ
to join Alpha.

02:57.277 --> 03:01.114
- I've been turned down for that.
- That and everything else in the world.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.817
Seriously, Kel, now,
what are you doing outside?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.320
Did you get this far
and you can't find the house?

03:08.956 --> 03:11.091
Laugh on, goo-boy.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.995
But remember: He who laughs last
laughs west.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.665
I happened to meet a guy
who's a member.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.901
He had me fill out some forms
and said if I qualified...

03:21.101 --> 03:22.402
Hi, Mr. Mailman.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.872
He said if I qualified,
that I'd be getting an invitation...

03:25.072 --> 03:26.740
...to the new-members party
today in the mail.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.077
That's, "party." Let me explain
the concept to you.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.945
You know when you line up
your toy soldiers...

03:32.145 --> 03:33.747
...and put cupcakes in front of them.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.083
It's kind of like that,
but with real people.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.751
I just wish the damn mail
would come.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.089
Here it is, Kel.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.525
Oh, God, the mailman
must be invisible.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.528
Alpha, huh?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.997
Let's see...
Dad's bills.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.132
Jury duty for Mom.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.834
Playboy for you.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.269
Playboy for Dad.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.337
Playgirl for Mom.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.307
Bitches in Heat for Buck.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.445
And here it is.
My invitation to Alpha.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.181
Read it to me, Bud.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.316
I don't have to read it, Kel.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.951
It says " Congratulations,
Miss Bundy.

04:11.151 --> 04:13.086
Your IQ score has placed you
square in the middle...

04:13.287 --> 04:15.055
...between an ashtray
and a pickle jar."

04:20.027 --> 04:22.162
"Congratulations, Miss Bundy.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.631
You have been invited to
our new-members mixer"?

04:24.832 --> 04:27.267
- It can't be.
- I'm in. I'm in.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.603
I'm a genius and you're not:

04:36.610 --> 04:40.080
Let me read this again. Ten thousand
special ed teachers can't be wrong.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.349
I'll prove it. Quick:
How many are in a gross?

04:42.549 --> 04:44.351
You and four friends.

04:46.587 --> 04:50.490
I shall now leave you to wallow in the
murky world of your own Bud-dom.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.494
I shall now let the family
behold my genius.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.011
It turns, therefore, I am.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.020
You know, I tease Al about it...

05:20.187 --> 05:22.623
...but there is nothing more exciting
than seeing real men...

05:22.823 --> 05:25.692
...use their hands and minds as one.
- I know.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.028
Look at the sweat
glistening off their bodies.

05:28.228 --> 05:31.598
Muscles tensed, brows furrowed.
I think they're almost finished.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.334
- Yes!
- I think they did it.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.036
And in only 15 minutes.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.973
Peg, we've opened the box.

05:46.313 --> 05:47.648
Gee, that's great, honey.

05:47.848 --> 05:51.318
Today the box,
tomorrow the cap on the toothpaste.

05:51.585 --> 05:54.288
You just can't stand to see a man
get ahead, can you?

05:54.488 --> 05:58.759
Hey, if the box was that easy to open,
imagine how easy the rest is gonna be.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.029
Excuse me, Fred and Barney.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.933
Before you start running around the
room, slapping each other's heinies...

06:06.133 --> 06:09.336
...how long is this gonna take you?
- Directions say 20 minutes.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.373
I say we can do it under 15.
Just watch our dust.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.254
Where were we?

06:27.721 --> 06:28.889
Step one.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.859
Well, read it to me.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.761
"Congratulations on your purchase
of the easy-to-put-together...

06:34.962 --> 06:38.532
...Handyman's Workbench 5000.
Open box."

06:39.132 --> 06:40.567
Well, we did that.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.205
Look, Peggy. Husbands in the mist.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.142
They're all the same.
My father was like that.

06:49.343 --> 06:52.746
He would sit on the porch and whittle
the same piece of wood for hours...

06:52.946 --> 06:55.382
...before he realized it was his finger.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.685
The only day my father would build
was Christmas Eve.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.554
He'd put together all my toys.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.289
Till I was old enough
to know it was him...

07:02.489 --> 07:04.424
...I always thought it was Santa
downstairs yelling:

07:05.459 --> 07:08.128
"Damn kid and her freaking wagon!"

07:09.296 --> 07:11.298
And then I'd go downstairs
on Christmas Day...

07:11.498 --> 07:14.134
...and find all my shiny, new,
bloody toys.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.603
Well, then this should bring back
some memories.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.373
Al's getting ready
to use the staple gun.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.344
- Oh, you little baby.
- Oh, get me loose.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.080
No. No, now, it'll slow us up.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.516
Have you seen any of those
L-shaped things?

07:29.716 --> 07:33.120
No. No, I've been finding these pieces
shaped like sevens.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.089
What idiot packed this box?

07:36.290 --> 07:39.426
Oh, well, maybe I can reshape them
with my blowtorch.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.995
- Blowtorch?
- Blowtorch?

07:45.432 --> 07:48.268
Please, please.
Kel, please take me with you.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.904
No, you are too stupid to get in.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.841
But I'll bring you back some leftovers
in a dummy bag.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.777
Now, go away before I'm tardy
for the party.

07:57.611 --> 08:01.081
Watch me as I effortlessly
turn the knob.

08:11.925 --> 08:16.497
Very interesting. Push in, pull out.
How should I remember that?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.065
Well...

08:24.471 --> 08:27.207
"Push," unlike "pull,"
starts with a P.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.844
Make new thoughts,
but keep the old.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.313
One is silver and the other is old.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.118
I've gotta get to the bottom of this.

08:39.785 --> 08:42.322
This blowtorch doesn't look clogged
to me.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.493
- You hold the lighter and let me look.
- All right.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.099
You can almost hear
the Looney Tunes theme, can't you?

09:00.474 --> 09:02.476
- My eyebrows!
- AI.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.444
- My eyebrows!
- Come on, Al!

09:04.645 --> 09:07.414
Somebody put out my eyebrows!

09:08.815 --> 09:11.618
Relax, Al, I'm depriving the fire
of oxygen.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.327
That's... That's better.

09:21.495 --> 09:23.931
Well, no... No need to worry.
Fire's out.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.301
One, two, three...

09:28.802 --> 09:30.103
This is to identify all new members.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.906
Thank you, kind sir
of merely average intelligence.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.947
Do you have an invitation, sir?

09:43.584 --> 09:44.918
This is a bus pass, sir.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.255
I must have left my invitation
at the hospital...

09:48.455 --> 09:50.224
...where I work as a doctor
at this young age.

09:50.424 --> 09:54.194
- Oh, name?
- Howser. Doogie Howser.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.365
- Go away, sir.
- Alrighty.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.401
But don't come crying to me,
saying, "Help me, Dr. Howser"...

10:01.602 --> 10:04.104
...when your high-paying, high-stress
job gives you an ulcer.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.910
Hi, my name's Harvey.
These parties are such a gas.

10:10.110 --> 10:14.281
- Hi there, Harv. Say, nice pencil pouch.
- Well, l...

10:24.791 --> 10:27.427
Well, of course the Soviet Union
was bound to fall.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.997
I mean, it's all the way
on the edge of the map.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.834
Kelly, you really should share
your theory with Ivan over there.

10:34.034 --> 10:37.304
And while you're there, tell him your
theory about how snowmen are born.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.777
- Was I wrong about her?
- She is all you said and more.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.113
She's sure to win you
the "stupidest date" award.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.716
Well, when I found her,
she was just staring at a door.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.285
But yours is no slouch.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.530
God, I love these idiot parties.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.705
Well, of course I'm very intelligent...

11:11.905 --> 11:15.042
...but I feel I make the statement
that brains and decent knockers...

11:15.242 --> 11:20.047
...can go hand in hand to march us
proudly into the 19th century.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.285
- Kel.
- Bud.

11:25.486 --> 11:26.620
I think you made a wrong turn.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.556
The Pimples Without Partners
meeting is down the hall.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.527
I don't know if I should tell you this,
what with me hating you and all...

11:33.727 --> 11:36.096
...but do you know what a
"pig party" is?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.098
Of course, I do. I'm a genius.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.068
It's where a bunch of cute people
find ugly dates, pretend to like them...

11:41.268 --> 11:43.770
...take them to a party
and laugh at them until they cry.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.640
- So you've done it before?
- That hurts.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.709
Have I ever invited you to a party?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.911
Now, that should prove
that I've never been to one.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.280
Well, you've been to one now.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.749
This is Alpha's version
of a pig party, Kel.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.920
Instead of ugly, they invite...
How should I put this delicately?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.256
- Morons, cretins, fools,
mind-blowing imbeciles.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.927
Everyone with a patch
is someone's dumb date.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.896
Come on, I'll show you.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.600
Hi, I'm Kelly. I'm a model.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.736
I'm Delbert. I'm a Los Angeles
public school teacher.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.604
That doesn't prove anything.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.774
He could just be a temp
or something.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.712
Hi, I'm Kelly. I'm a model.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.148
Hi, I'm Ralph.
I'm a network executive.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.788
- But I'm still not sold.
- Well, does this sell you?

12:46.567 --> 12:48.068
Oh, my God, it's true.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.571
- Kel. Kel, wait.
- Leave me alone.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.139
You just wanna rub it in.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.408
I got the rest of my life to do that.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.510
I just wanted to tell you
not to feel bad.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.079
Not to feel bad? How can I not?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.782
Do you know what it's like to have
people laughing at you at a party?

13:01.982 --> 13:05.486
To have them talk behind your back?
To exist only to be made fun of?

13:05.686 --> 13:08.222
Well, naturally, you do, but I don't.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.557
It hurts. Let's go.

13:11.024 --> 13:15.128
Kel, come on. You can't run and hide.
That's not the Bundy way.

13:15.329 --> 13:18.332
You gotta get back at these people
the Bundy way.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.106
But I like changing my underwear.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.310
The other Bundy way, Kel.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.848
Destroy their superior smiles
with sheer, pointless violence.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.118
You'd do that for me even after
the way I treated you tonight?

13:38.318 --> 13:39.987
Hey, they did turn me down.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.823
Well, then you'd have to go
beat up every girl in Chicago.

13:43.457 --> 13:45.826
I'm just kidding you,
you little wallaby.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.163
Let's go kick a little genius butt.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.202
Hey, five-eyes.

13:57.704 --> 14:01.341
Attention all guests.
We are the intellectually challenged.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.510
Does that mean we let nerds
make fun of us?

14:03.710 --> 14:05.078
That would make us lower than them.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.848
So I say, let's return
to the pecking order of high school.

14:08.048 --> 14:11.151
So come on, people, if you're stupid
and you know it, punch a nerd.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.726
That's right. Make them
eat their pencil pouches.

14:30.237 --> 14:33.006
Kel. Kel, come on.
I think we're finished here.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.441
Okay.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.252
All right, let me know
when I get all the way through.

14:46.587 --> 14:47.788
Okey-dokey.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.826
Sorry, pal.

14:53.126 --> 14:57.064
- Oh, can I have that one?
- Well, you'll have to trade me.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.765
Well, I have a nice action shot...

14:58.966 --> 15:01.635
...of the men
nailing themselves together...

15:01.835 --> 15:04.071
...and then running
around the room idiotically.

15:04.271 --> 15:08.208
Well, how about this one of Al's face
when the circular saw fell in lap?

15:08.809 --> 15:10.277
Give me one of them
L-shaped things.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.979
Well, there's only one more left.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.948
You'll have to make some more
out of these extra sevens.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.153
I can't find the hole.

15:26.093 --> 15:29.029
Hell, I'll just sand the whole thing.
It's like my Dad used to say:

15:29.229 --> 15:33.033
"There is no mix-up
a sander can't fix up."

15:33.433 --> 15:37.437
- God, that's beautiful.
- Plug us in, buddy.

15:37.838 --> 15:40.140
Al, don't you have too many things
plugged in already?

15:40.374 --> 15:44.311
Peg, the only experience you have
are with things that use batteries.

15:45.646 --> 15:46.847
Men know plugs.

15:47.815 --> 15:50.851
- Plug us in, pal.
- Photo op.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.727
He hasn't moved like that in years.

16:01.662 --> 16:04.598
Do you think Jefferson is stupid enough
to try and unplug him now?

16:04.798 --> 16:06.366
I'll save you, buddy.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.904
I guess he is.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.140
- To men.
- To men.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.139
Hi, Daddy. I couldn't sleep.

16:46.340 --> 16:50.210
Well, since you're up,
share Daddy's triumph.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.947
The Handyman Workbench 5000.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.950
- It's very nice, Daddy.
- Oh, don't touch it.

16:57.918 --> 16:59.386
It's just for looking at.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.924
- So, what's up?
- Daddy, do you think I'm stupid?

17:04.124 --> 17:05.125
Well...

17:06.527 --> 17:09.530
Pumpkin, "stupid" is a relative term.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.900
Well, you're a relative.
That's why I'm asking you.

17:15.234 --> 17:18.038
Well, pumpkin, see, some people
like to call someone...

17:18.238 --> 17:19.573
Let's say you.

17:19.772 --> 17:23.844
- Stupid because you just haven't found
what you're really good at yet.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.547
And everybody's good at something.
Take me, I'm good with my hands.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.085
And your mother.
Who's ever been better...

17:32.286 --> 17:33.687
...at doing nothing than your mother?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.856
We'll forget about Bud
because he's actually smart...

17:36.056 --> 17:38.725
...and we'll move on to Buck.
Remember when he was a puppy...

17:38.926 --> 17:40.761
...he used to run all around
with all that energy?

17:40.961 --> 17:42.796
Well, obviously he didn't like it.

17:43.597 --> 17:45.399
But years later, he found out
what he's good at.

17:45.599 --> 17:47.634
Look at him, laying up there.

17:48.936 --> 17:50.838
Attaboy, Buck.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.774
What I'm saying, sweetheart, is
if you give yourself enough time...

17:53.974 --> 17:55.876
...you'll find out
what you're good at too.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.444
But I'm tired of waiting.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.680
I'm afraid I'm never gonna find it.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.482
Maybe what I'm good at
is being stupid.

18:01.682 --> 18:03.150
I guess it'll have to be enough.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.552
I'd feel better if there was just
one person on his earth...

18:05.752 --> 18:07.087
...that I was smarter than.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.875
Good night, Daddy.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.455
Jefferson?

18:41.655 --> 18:43.824
Jefferson, come see, I finished it.
I finished it.

18:44.305 --> 18:50.491
