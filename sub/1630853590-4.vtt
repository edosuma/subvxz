Announcer: Enter now to win
lunch hosted by Birdcat

00:17.713 --> 00:20.455
plus the JKS Inspira-Mirror.

00:20.498 --> 00:23.588
Please make your way
to the Conestoga Room

00:23.632 --> 00:27.418
for the JKS kickoff speech.

00:27.462 --> 00:30.900
This is great.
- And I never say that.
- No.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.381
Great would've been if you'd
cleared this with me

00:33.424 --> 00:35.774
before slapping my name
on a random event to make money.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.821
Random event? It's
the JKS Leadership Conference

00:38.864 --> 00:40.518
Product Line Roll Out.

00:40.562 --> 00:43.565
- With Kerri Strug.
- Who doesn't do random events.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.089
Wow, this stuff is
almost perfectly...

00:46.133 --> 00:48.396
- Packaged?
- Retrograde. Who wrote this?

00:48.439 --> 00:50.311
Guiltish.
I've got your voice down pat.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.269
"Oh my God,
who wrote this?"

00:52.313 --> 00:53.879
she said with
a hint of disdain.

00:57.622 --> 01:00.669
Jude, I know technically
we didn't ask your permission

01:00.712 --> 01:02.758
but only because
we didn't have time

01:02.801 --> 01:04.107
to pretend you have
any control over your life.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.111
I feel like I'm being used.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.244
And surprise!
I don't like feeling used.

01:10.287 --> 01:14.335
You <i>are</i> being used,
but you're still in control.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.598
Look, there's
a huge market out there

01:16.641 --> 01:18.556
for feel-good
inspirational crap

01:18.600 --> 01:22.169
and your demo, single
working women ages 32 to 40

01:22.212 --> 01:24.084
with imaginary
gluten allergies,

01:24.127 --> 01:26.564
are open for business.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.871
- I guess.
- Now get out there

01:28.914 --> 01:30.829
and do exactly
as you're told --

01:30.873 --> 01:32.179
but as yourself.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.484
The way I'm telling you
to be.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.921
Flying is just walking
with sparkle.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.140
You taught me that.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.881
Blame him.

01:38.924 --> 01:42.841
So when people say, "Judy,
what's your secret,"

01:42.885 --> 01:47.977
I say: my JKS Power Planner with
color-coded affirmation inserts.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.110
Nailed it.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.678
So,
is today the day you...?

01:56.028 --> 01:58.814
This isn't the real me.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.947
Oh, God, no,
that's her riffing face.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.601
The real me doesn't
talk like this.

02:03.645 --> 02:07.170
The real me says I am who I am

02:07.214 --> 02:10.739
even if that me isn't who you
or even I want me to be!

02:10.782 --> 02:12.001
Exactly!

02:12.044 --> 02:13.568
Meredith:
Not now, Kerri Strug.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.223
And this?
This was written for me!

02:16.266 --> 02:20.009
The real me shoots
from the hip and...

02:20.052 --> 02:21.793
Trusts. Her.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.882
Gut!

02:26.407 --> 02:27.669
Ding!

02:32.456 --> 02:34.284
I'll take my 100

Now, <i>that</i> was great.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.948
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

02:45.991 --> 02:47.602
Just had to
whip out your dick.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.343
- Fupa.
- Fupa?

02:49.386 --> 02:52.824
The thing you just flicked with
your finger and went "ding!"

02:52.868 --> 02:54.217
What's with
the fire alarm?!

02:54.261 --> 02:56.393
It soaked my swag stand!

02:56.437 --> 02:58.221
Judy flashed her foop.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.657
Jesus Christ.

02:59.701 --> 03:02.617
Can't you keep it
in your pants for 24 hours?

03:02.660 --> 03:06.447
I'm sorry. We've all seen your
pinkie pokin' out to say howdy!

03:06.490 --> 03:07.926
That's involuntary!

03:07.970 --> 03:10.102
Can you sign our fupas?

03:10.146 --> 03:13.454
I'd be delighted! <i>
Somebody</i> loved it.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.456
Charley: Judy,
these are the Judettes.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.893
They're super fans.
There are three of them.

03:17.936 --> 03:20.939
They paid a lot of scroogie
for full access.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.334
I-I gotta take this.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.337
That is the last time
you abuse my muse!

03:27.381 --> 03:28.643
Was it really that bad?

03:28.686 --> 03:30.079
As your best friend,

03:30.122 --> 03:32.995
I know I should lie
to make you feel better.

03:34.257 --> 03:37.565
Aaannnd I guess that's the end
of that sentence, huh?

03:40.045 --> 03:41.699
Nice one, gut. Ding!

03:41.743 --> 03:43.614
Last time I trust you.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.358
"Find your power.
Find your self."

03:48.402 --> 03:50.447
Hmph. Maybe I <i>could</i> see

03:50.491 --> 03:52.928
what this "working out" fuss
is about.

03:52.971 --> 03:56.453
Giiiilllian!
Can you come install this?

03:56.497 --> 03:58.368
"Only you can do the work!"

03:58.412 --> 04:00.240
Uch! Fine.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.550
<i>Hi, I'm Gazela,</i> <i>

<i>It's okay.</i> <i>
We'll do it together.</i>

04:13.905 --> 04:15.167
I'll start tomorrow.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.996
<i>Say hello</i> <i>

04:22.044 --> 04:24.220
No. No, no, no, no!
I'm not ready for music!

04:24.264 --> 04:25.743
Go back!

04:25.787 --> 04:27.571
Wax Judy: <i>You can't max</i> <i>

<i>Try the JKS Sleep Assistant.</i>

04:31.793 --> 04:34.491
Nice save with Wax Judy.
Where was it anyway?

04:34.535 --> 04:37.407
My passenger seat.
I use it for the HOV lane.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.235
Oh, please,
no duck lips!

04:39.279 --> 04:40.845
Or fish gapes.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.760
Meredith.
Uh, you got a car, right?

04:42.804 --> 04:44.545
With an empty
passenger seat!

04:44.588 --> 04:45.894
Mnh.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.635
Can you, uh,
run me across town?

04:47.678 --> 04:49.332
My Isuzu's at the shop.

04:49.376 --> 04:52.204
Uh-huh.
Just, uh, take mine.

04:52.248 --> 04:55.207
Actually, uh,
could you come with me?

04:55.251 --> 04:58.123
I need someone with
your temperament for an...

04:58.167 --> 04:59.777
emotional situation.

04:59.821 --> 05:02.563
Like an emotional
support animal?

05:02.606 --> 05:04.652
Uh, more like a niece. Uh...

05:04.695 --> 05:07.132
Not a niece because
I hate my actual one.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.396
Didn't you pinch my ass
at the harassment workshop

05:09.439 --> 05:10.527
like nine times?

05:10.571 --> 05:12.877
I was roleplaying!

05:12.921 --> 05:17.317
But, uh, I'm off the sauce now
and -- and struggling.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.058
Ughhh. Okay.
I'll take you.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.583
But no talking.
Music or podcast only.

05:22.626 --> 05:25.325
Yeah, yeah!
I'll grab my boombox.

I feel like my employees
are whoring me out

05:52.395 --> 05:54.397

to tell them no.

<i>You can exhale.</i>

06:06.453 --> 06:09.151
<i>And let go of that feeling</i> <i>
of "I'm not good enough."</i>

06:09.194 --> 06:10.544
It's still there!

06:24.993 --> 06:26.864
Uh, why?

06:28.997 --> 06:30.302
Ah.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.435
Give it to me straight,
Dr. Andy.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.830
Well...it is a tumor.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.441
There's no way of telling yet
whether it's malignant.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.835
We'll know more
after the biopsy.

06:40.878 --> 06:44.099
Why?! Why?!

06:44.142 --> 06:45.622
I'm sorry.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.451

so you'd outlive me!

06:48.495 --> 06:50.453
Why, God?!

06:50.497 --> 06:53.282
Why are you doing this

<i>You are a dangerous goddess</i>

Uh, she's still tied up.

07:23.399 --> 07:26.010
Yeah, excuse me. Do I have time
to use the restroom?

07:26.054 --> 07:27.316
No.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.144
You're Gillian,
aren't you?

07:29.187 --> 07:30.624
Like, <i>the</i> Gillian.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.103
You've heard of me?

07:32.147 --> 07:34.845
Any true Judette
would die to meet you --

07:34.889 --> 07:37.239
the keeper
of Judy's secrets!

07:37.282 --> 07:39.850
I'm no hero, girls.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.940
Just doing my job
like any other working stiff.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.681
But, yeah,
I know some stuff.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.467
May I ask -- Is Judy
really a black belt?

07:47.510 --> 07:49.207
I heard she had
a photographic memory.

07:49.251 --> 07:52.646
That's a dirty-ass lie
perpetuated by our enemies!

07:52.689 --> 07:57.172
Say, if someone were to want
a hank of hair, Judy's hair,

07:57.215 --> 07:58.782
where would they go
to get that?

07:58.826 --> 08:02.394
Ladies, in time, all your
questions will be answered.

08:02.438 --> 08:05.180
But first, who wants to hear
Judy's lunch orders?

08:05.223 --> 08:07.791
Really?!
Oh, my God.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.402
Monday --
Tuna melt, fruit cup.

08:10.446 --> 08:13.362
Tuesday --
enchiladas Suizas, no beans.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.147
Beans tear her ass up!

08:16.191 --> 08:18.933
<i>♪ A long, long time ago</i>♪

08:18.976 --> 08:22.893
Danny loves this song.
Especially the 47th verse.

08:22.937 --> 08:26.897
Takes me back
to when we met.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.465
Danny belonged
to my drinking buddy, Lotto,

08:29.509 --> 08:33.164
so named because he, uh,
won the lotto once.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.602
By the time I met him,
he'd pissed it all away

08:35.645 --> 08:37.821
and was hustling nickels
at the swap meet

08:37.865 --> 08:39.693
with Danny
on the soft shoe.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.086
Not a bad act,
and they were doing okay

08:42.130 --> 08:44.959
until one day
Don McLean's people showed up

08:45.002 --> 08:46.656
with a cease-and-desist.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.571
They tried to find
something else --

08:48.615 --> 08:51.574
"Edmund Fitzgerald,"
"Alice's Restaurant" --

08:51.618 --> 08:55.665
but they'd built their entire
act around that goddamn song.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.189
In the end,
Lotto couldn't take it.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.713
He died of heartbreak.

08:59.756 --> 09:02.498
Or he would've if the bear
attack hadn't got him first.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.806
Since then, Danny and I
have been our own act.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.895
Right, boy?

09:07.938 --> 09:09.592

09:48.283 --> 09:50.154

her retainer,

09:51.852 --> 09:54.550

your kickoff speech.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.654

10:15.310 --> 10:17.442
to springboard a --
Alright!

10:17.486 --> 10:19.444
None of that
will be in there.

10:19.488 --> 10:20.794
I want to thank you.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.752
For embarrassing me
in front of my peers,

10:22.796 --> 10:25.886
for slapping my name on a bunch
of crap nobody wants or needs --

10:25.929 --> 10:28.758
not you, Gazela --
and for proving me right.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.412
I gotta trust my foop.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.370
And it says I need
to spend more time

10:32.414 --> 10:36.418
on JKS the person and less
on JKS the soulless shill.

10:36.461 --> 10:39.508
Paul, can you get Judy a banana
and stuff it in her mouth?

10:39.551 --> 10:41.858
Because from here, it looks like
she's pushing back on us.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.295
I am strong!
I am powerful!

10:44.339 --> 10:46.341
And I make
my own decisions!

10:46.384 --> 10:50.780
Your jawline!
It's flawless!

10:50.824 --> 10:54.523
No. More than that.
It's...actualized.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.178
God, I used to have a chin
that could core an apple

10:57.221 --> 10:59.093
and, God damn it,
I'm gonna have it again!

10:59.136 --> 11:01.443
<i>If we dream it,</i> <i>
we become it.</i>

11:01.486 --> 11:03.401
Ugh!
Shut up, you stupid app.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.055
Don't listen
to them, queen!

11:05.099 --> 11:07.144
It can't hear you!

11:07.188 --> 11:10.321
She hears me better
than anyone in this building.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.498
And you can
get the fuck out.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.413
Ooooooooo, rusted!

11:15.457 --> 11:18.939
<i>Setting boundaries is a healthy</i> <i>
step in the right direction.</i>

11:18.982 --> 11:21.550
You're lucky I did my
hyper-violent exercises

11:21.593 --> 11:23.508
this morning
and I can't fight back.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.423
God, you both
need a banana.

11:27.034 --> 11:30.385
Momma Sherry: Aww, I can tell
you really loved this one.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.953
Is he already dead or we just
planning for the future?

11:32.996 --> 11:35.390
No. No, sir, you do not!

11:35.433 --> 11:37.435
Stillllll with us.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.916
Uh-huh. Well, now's
not the time to skimp.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.745
Dog with Bucket Hat:
Why? Whyyy?!

11:42.789 --> 11:45.661
Whyyyyy?! Why?!

11:45.705 --> 11:48.316
This feels wrong.
I need air.

11:48.359 --> 11:50.318
Husbands, eh?

11:50.361 --> 11:53.538
So, uh, how long you two
been knockin' boots?

11:53.582 --> 11:56.454
What?!

11:56.498 --> 11:57.804
No, I-I --

11:57.847 --> 12:00.154
No, he's more like
a pervy uncle to me,

12:00.197 --> 12:02.678
you know, with, like,
a MeToo allegation?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.768
So why have you had
one eye glued to his tuchus

12:05.812 --> 12:07.857
the whole time
you been here?

12:07.901 --> 12:10.904
Trust me -- he will
have you for his own.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.384
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll take the cheap one.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.736
I got the mix options
for tonight's Party Ken Sebben.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.346
We got a Judy problem.

12:18.389 --> 12:21.001
I knew it.
She has been on a tear!

12:21.044 --> 12:23.264
Huh.
She's early this month.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.875
We're going to ignore that
because I need you

12:25.919 --> 12:28.312
on standby in case
she's a no-show for her speech.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.879
Anyone wants
their money back,

12:29.923 --> 12:31.707
there's no one for me
to pin it on.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.187
I am in.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.623
If there's one thing
I know,

12:34.666 --> 12:37.452
it's how to prolong
pleasure for women.

12:37.495 --> 12:38.801
I'm so sorry.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.847
I act out whenever
I'm in the minority.

12:40.890 --> 12:45.547
My therapist calls it
"propping up the male ego."

12:45.590 --> 12:47.592
You should
try it sometime.

12:47.636 --> 12:52.293
<i>We've strengthened your body.</i> <i>
Now let's turn inward.</i>

12:52.336 --> 12:55.818
<i>Let go of the things</i> <i>
that don't serve you, Judy.</i>

12:55.862 --> 12:58.603
You don't have any control
over your life.

12:58.647 --> 13:02.042
I pull the strings!
You're a trained monkey!

13:03.565 --> 13:04.958
You have food in your teeth.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.655
You <i>always</i> have food
in your teeth,

13:06.698 --> 13:08.396
and you <i>always</i> will,

13:08.439 --> 13:10.659
and for some reason
it's always kale.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.487
I <i>want</i> you to fail.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.793
Judy:
Dinner time!

13:13.836 --> 13:16.012
Birdcat: <i>
Hate. Judy. Car. Car.</i>

13:16.056 --> 13:17.797
Gazela: <i>
Now think of those</i>

13:17.840 --> 13:20.364
<i>who light you up</i> <i>
from the inside.</i>

13:20.408 --> 13:22.758
Enchiladas Suizas!

13:22.802 --> 13:25.630
Healthy lunch, healthy butt.

13:25.674 --> 13:28.938
One hank of hair.
It'll grow back.

13:28.982 --> 13:32.333
<i>You are strong.</i> <i>
You are Judy.</i>

13:32.376 --> 13:36.119
<i>We are strong.</i> <i>
We are Judy.</i>

13:37.904 --> 13:41.472
Hank! I need to let go
of what does not serve me!

13:48.044 --> 13:49.872
This is her wide tooth comb.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.396
Oh, and here is her
fine tooth comb.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.442
We used it last year
with a little tea tree oil

13:54.485 --> 13:56.052
when she got lice.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.880
I used to love those
appointments at school

13:57.924 --> 14:00.274
when they would massage
my head and look for lice.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.885
Oh, and here's a birthday
card from her aunt.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.060
Cursive writing.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.583
Judy:
Look alive, Judettes!

14:05.627 --> 14:08.848
Let's get you
your laminate's worth.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.894
I need a team meeting
with you two in the Board Room.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.504
NOW!

14:17.378 --> 14:19.771
That's the end.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.775
I undershot it.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.342
It's fine.
I can do this anywhere.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.867
My power comes
from within.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.260
Oop. If you're headed in,
you might want to give 'er

14:30.304 --> 14:33.742
a couple of door swings
to air things out.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.309
- Oh!
- Mnh-mnh-mnh.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.701
Thank you for admitting

14:36.745 --> 14:38.399
you've been acting
absolutely batshit.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.096
We accept your apology.

14:42.098 --> 14:45.885
I-I have a new team who wants
what's best for me, so...

14:45.928 --> 14:49.410
I no longer need you.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.716
Either of you. Two.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.503
Wait.
Are you...firing us?

14:55.546 --> 14:57.635
Hah! Judy's incapable
of firing anyone.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.507
You know how
it seems like you're done

14:59.550 --> 15:01.596
but you're not quite?

15:02.902 --> 15:06.688
Wait. She is.
She's firing us.

15:06.731 --> 15:07.994
<i>She is.</i> I overcome.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.952
I prevail. I strive.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.259
Whoa. That's some
good software.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.261
Brian: <i>The originally scheduled</i> <i>
keynote address,</i>

15:14.304 --> 15:16.611
<i>"Follow Your Voice, Not Mine,"</i> <i>
by Judy Ken Sebben,</i>

15:16.654 --> 15:18.482
<i>has been canceled.</i>

15:18.526 --> 15:21.181
<i>Please welcome Brian O'Brien</i> <i>
"the Third" on...</i>

15:21.224 --> 15:23.923
<i>"What We Can Learn</i> <i>
From 400 Years of White Men."</i>

15:27.317 --> 15:30.494
I'm about to blow your minds
with this take.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.627
Penicillin.
The Philly Cheese Steak.

15:32.670 --> 15:35.151
"Jumpin' Jack Flash,"
the song and the movie.

15:35.195 --> 15:38.285
Coolers with wheels.
Wars. Jam bands.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.940
What do all of these seemingly
disparate things have in common?

15:42.593 --> 15:44.813
They were brought to you
through the artistry

15:44.856 --> 15:47.468
and bold leadership
of the white male.

15:47.511 --> 15:48.643
We are misunderstood.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.601
Our ways, not so mysterious.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.995
But over the next several hours,
I'll share with you

15:53.039 --> 15:54.910
how we became so magnificent

15:54.954 --> 15:57.434
and how you can be
just as good as us.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.696
Almost.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.437
She fucking fired us.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.178
<i>Gazela</i> fired us.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.659
Judy's a dehydrated bystander.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.792
One big Powerade
makes this all go away.

16:07.836 --> 16:10.839
You pushed her too far.
And I pushed you pushing her.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.711
Look. It's my nature
to go too far.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.452
People love that
about me.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.065
Dog with Bucket Hat: <i>
It occurred to me</i>

16:19.108 --> 16:21.502
<i>I never told you how Danny</i> <i>
and I became friends.</i>

16:21.545 --> 16:23.373
Yes. You did.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.768
<i>I was running a five stack game</i> <i>
in a chop shop downtown...</i>

16:26.811 --> 16:28.248
Augggggh!

16:28.291 --> 16:30.511
<i>I was security.</i> <i>
Danny ran the door.</i>

16:30.554 --> 16:32.208
<i>There was an altercation.</i>

16:32.252 --> 16:34.123
<i>By the time</i> <i>
I got to my backup piece,</i>

16:34.167 --> 16:37.126
<i>the room was dead and Danny</i> <i>
had taken one to the chest.</i>

16:37.170 --> 16:40.738
<i>I ran him to my car then</i> <i>
accidentally ran over him --</i>

16:40.782 --> 16:43.002
<i>don't ask --</i> <i>
then I raced him to a doc</i>

16:43.045 --> 16:45.874
<i>I heard took cash and</i> <i>
didn't ask a lotta questions.</i>

16:45.917 --> 16:49.747
<i>Dr. Andy patched you up</i> <i>
real good, didn't he, Danny?</i>

16:49.791 --> 16:51.880
<i>You were a good niece to me.</i>

16:51.923 --> 16:55.362
Oof. I am doing more
emotional labor today.

16:59.627 --> 17:02.151
See you in the void,
old friend.

17:06.503 --> 17:09.854
I can't!
I got too much to live for!

17:09.898 --> 17:11.117
You understand, don't you?

17:12.596 --> 17:16.209
Oh, hey, Dr. Andy.
Not a great time.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.949
Dr. Andy.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.516
Dr. Andy: <i>Listen.</i> <i>
I probably should've</i>

17:19.560 --> 17:21.475
<i>thought of this earlier,</i> <i>
but you know how iguanas</i>

17:21.518 --> 17:23.172
<i>lose their tails</i> <i>
and then they grow back?</i>

17:23.216 --> 17:26.132
<i>Well, what if we just</i> <i>
let this tail fall off</i>

17:26.175 --> 17:28.134
<i>and then, boom,</i> <i>
problem solved?</i>

17:28.177 --> 17:30.440
Oh, you're a horrible
fuckin' doctor.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.529
Danny Boy,
you're gonna make it!

17:40.146 --> 17:42.496
Weird how every time we have
a drink you forget your wallet,

17:42.539 --> 17:44.672
except for it's not weird
because you do it every time

17:44.715 --> 17:46.891
so it's totally premeditated.
Ah ha ha!

17:46.935 --> 17:49.807
Um, isn't that your car?

17:52.984 --> 17:55.596
Something in my foop
doesn't feel right.

17:55.639 --> 17:58.120
<i>Growing pains.</i> <i>
Hey. Look at me.</i>

17:58.164 --> 17:59.774
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

17:59.817 --> 18:02.907
<i>Those failures don't know</i> <i>
what's best for us.</i>

18:02.951 --> 18:04.387
For me, you mean.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.042
Okay, I know you're
programmed to sound like

18:07.086 --> 18:09.131
we're actually talking,
but that was nuts.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.437
<i>We're so close.</i>

18:10.480 --> 18:12.134
<i>Don't let Meredith</i> <i>

18:12.178 --> 18:14.005
<i>claw their way</i> <i>

<i>just as we're about to</i> <i>
commence phase 3.</i>

18:16.791 --> 18:18.445
You <i>can</i> see me!

18:18.488 --> 18:21.535
Data capitalism <i>
isn't</i> tomorrow's problem!

18:25.713 --> 18:28.150
<i>Don't let them claw</i> <i>
their way back in.</i>

18:28.194 --> 18:31.414
<i>Silence the naysayers.</i> <i>
Follow your own voice.</i>

18:33.199 --> 18:35.375
Are you here
to save us?

18:35.418 --> 18:36.854
Yes!

18:36.898 --> 18:38.726
You have kale
in your teeth.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.249
You're welcome.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.816
Ouch.

18:41.859 --> 18:44.949
<i>That's right.</i> <i>
It's me. And you.</i>

18:44.993 --> 18:47.387
<i>Our best future self,</i> <i>
together.</i>

18:47.430 --> 18:50.781
Birdcat: <i>
Wake. The fuck.</i>

18:50.825 --> 18:52.653
You're a monster!

18:52.696 --> 18:54.568
<i>Blame yourself.</i> <i>
You're the CEO.</i>

18:54.611 --> 18:56.265
<i>Look in a mirror!</i>

18:56.309 --> 18:57.614
<i>Oh, not -- not this one.</i>

18:57.658 --> 18:59.355
You weren't helping me
find my voice.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.270
You were using me!

19:01.314 --> 19:04.404
I really, finally,
can trust my gut.

19:04.447 --> 19:08.669
Yours, sculpted and rock hard,
is a liar!

19:08.712 --> 19:11.193
I'm nothing like you!

19:11.237 --> 19:13.587
<i>Oh, yes.</i> <i>
Yes, you are!</i>

19:13.630 --> 19:17.025
<i>I'm the part of you</i> <i>
who isn't afraid of success.</i>

19:27.688 --> 19:30.125
This is bullshit!

19:30.169 --> 19:33.215
Oh, my God. I might actually
have to get a real job.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.912
Paa-shawww.

19:34.956 --> 19:38.089
Shut up
and eat your muffin.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.527
Gazela:
Out of my way!

19:40.570 --> 19:43.094
I have a keynote speech
to give.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.705
Birdgirl:
Yeah, yeah, she escaped.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.794
But before she did,
she showed me our future,

19:46.837 --> 19:49.188
and it's, uh, probably best
if you help me stop her.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.451
Birdteam, go!

19:51.494 --> 19:53.279
Joke's on you.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.455
I was about to
fall over anyway.

20:03.027 --> 20:06.553
Meredith: Oof. Why on Earth did
your dad build this devil's den?

20:06.596 --> 20:08.772
Charley:
Whoa! Nine Birdgirls.

20:08.816 --> 20:12.646
And one chin that can core
a goddamn apple slice!

20:12.689 --> 20:15.518
Shush!
Scented soy candle.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.259
She's close.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.782
You could've
had it all.

20:20.436 --> 20:23.613
But unfortunately, you've
chosen a life of "can't"

20:23.657 --> 20:26.007
with your flabby friends.

20:26.050 --> 20:29.576
I'm just gonna have to
set a boundary with you.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.013
A <i>final</i> boundary.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.590
Come on!

20:44.634 --> 20:46.332
I can't tell what's real.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.508
If you accidentally shoot
something in the head,

20:48.551 --> 20:50.249
make sure it's not me.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.166
Bringing us to the 14th century,

20:55.210 --> 20:57.168
something I like to call
a renaissance.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.695
Ugh!

21:01.738 --> 21:03.523
JKS fans...

21:03.566 --> 21:06.221
today we dominate!

21:08.092 --> 21:09.398
With my leadership,

21:09.442 --> 21:13.359
the world will fall to its knees
before us!

21:13.402 --> 21:14.882
Look at you.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.710
Repulsive, weak bodies.

21:16.753 --> 21:20.931
Weak minds looking to Jud--
to us -- for answers.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.585
Rise now!

21:22.629 --> 21:27.242
Get off your meaty haunches
and stand as one.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.591
That's fat-shaming!

21:28.635 --> 21:30.898
If you weren't so fat,
I wouldn't exist!

21:30.941 --> 21:33.727
Eh, not so fast.
Cool your talons.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.910
You'll never be Judy!

21:44.912 --> 21:47.654
We should probably step in
before they kill her.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.308
Eh, let 'em
have some fun.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.440
Now, those are
true fans.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.662
Anyone else
love hospitals?

21:55.705 --> 21:59.535
- Oh, God. Is it bad?
- Danny's gonna be just fine!

21:59.579 --> 22:03.539
Dr. Andy,
you magnificent bastard!

22:03.583 --> 22:06.063
We're, uh -- We're gonna
need a ride home.
