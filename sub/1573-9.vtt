<b>6x09 - "The Disappeared", part 2</b>

00:22.291 --> 00:23.959
<i> Lost!</i>

00:24.001 --> 00:27.462
<i>Queen Julia of the planet
Bardotta has been abducted.</i>

00:27.504 --> 00:31.091
<i>If Representative Jar Jar Binks
and Jedi Master Mace Windu</i>

00:31.133 --> 00:33.969
<i>cannot find the missing Queen
in three rotations,</i>

00:34.011 --> 00:37.472
<i>a sinister prophecy will be fulfilled.</i>

00:37.514 --> 00:39.599
<i>The bloodthirsty Frangawl cult</i>

00:39.641 --> 00:41.601
<i>will take over
the Bardottan government,</i>

00:41.643 --> 00:44.313
<i>and its planetary system
will be overwhelmed</i>

00:44.355 --> 00:47.649
<i>by chaos, death, and destruction.</i>

01:06.793 --> 01:09.213
So tell me exactly
what you saw

01:09.255 --> 01:11.464
when you were being
held prisoner by the cultists.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.300
It's like mesa said.

01:13.342 --> 01:16.053
The cultists took
one of the Dagoyan Masters

01:16.095 --> 01:17.679
and sacrificed him.

01:17.721 --> 01:20.473
Hesa got all crispy fried,
and then theysa stole the Force

01:20.515 --> 01:23.394
right out of him
and put it in a shiny ball.

01:23.434 --> 01:26.272
So the cultists
are stealing living Force

01:26.313 --> 01:29.024
and trapping it
in a containment sphere.

01:29.066 --> 01:32.443
Yes, deysa try to steal
my living Force too,

01:32.485 --> 01:33.862
but yousa saved me.

01:33.904 --> 01:35.572
Hmm...

01:35.614 --> 01:38.242
And now they plan to do
the same thing with the Queen,

01:38.284 --> 01:39.993
but to what end?

01:40.035 --> 01:41.828
The Cultists couldn't exploit
the living Force

01:41.870 --> 01:43.830
like a Jedi or a Sith.

01:43.872 --> 01:47.667
I sense something else...
a darker presence.

01:47.709 --> 01:50.796
Maxibig the Force,
Masteren Mace,

01:50.837 --> 01:52.756
but howsa we gonna
find the Queenie?

01:52.798 --> 01:54.549
She's still a prisoner.

01:54.591 --> 01:57.428
If the containment sphere
has gathered enough

01:57.469 --> 01:59.012
of the living Force
as you suggest,

01:59.054 --> 02:01.640
I will be able
to sense its location.

02:01.681 --> 02:04.810
If we find the sphere,
we will find the Queen.

02:04.851 --> 02:06.186
Okeyday.

02:06.228 --> 02:08.854
Wesa make a bombad team,
Masteren Mace.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.607
Indeed.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.714
Where...

02:34.756 --> 02:36.800
Where am I?

02:36.842 --> 02:38.551
Who are you?

02:38.593 --> 02:40.137
Jar Jar.

02:40.179 --> 02:42.222
Jar Jar, where are you?

02:42.264 --> 02:44.141
Unhand me!

02:45.392 --> 02:47.019
Sleep.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.479
No.

02:48.519 --> 02:50.521
No...

02:50.563 --> 02:54.901
Brother, another vision
of the Great Mother came to me.

02:54.943 --> 02:57.446
She said the Jedi
knows of the sphere

02:57.488 --> 03:00.073
and that he is following us
here with the Gungan.

03:00.115 --> 03:03.076
The Great Mother warned us
our plan would be discovered

03:03.118 --> 03:05.204
if a Jedi ever came
to Bardotta.

03:05.245 --> 03:09.749
We did not know the Gungan
had such powerful friends.

03:09.791 --> 03:11.043
We must hurry.

03:11.084 --> 03:12.585
Once we sacrifice the Queen

03:12.627 --> 03:14.921
and transfer the living Force
to the Great Mother,

03:14.963 --> 03:17.924
she will deal with the Jedi.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.241
Letsa get going.

03:42.282 --> 03:44.201
Calm yourself,
Representative.

03:44.243 --> 03:45.952
Stay still.

03:45.994 --> 03:47.579
But wesa must hurry.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.498
That city, it'sa mooie big.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.875
Wesa have to move fast
to catch the cultists.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.460
We cannot rush into this.

03:53.502 --> 03:56.838
We must remain calm
and let the Force guide us.

03:58.173 --> 04:01.051
But maybe using da Force
taking too longo,

04:01.093 --> 04:02.969
and they getting away.

04:03.011 --> 04:06.432
No, running blindly through
the city will only waste time

04:06.473 --> 04:07.766
and allow them to escape.

04:07.807 --> 04:09.476
Now be still.

04:09.518 --> 04:12.479
Okeyday, Masteren Mace.

04:13.605 --> 04:16.649
I see people,

04:16.690 --> 04:19.528
market, streets.

04:19.570 --> 04:21.738
Yep, mesa see that
from here too.

04:21.779 --> 04:25.451
I see crowds.

04:25.492 --> 04:29.580
Wait, a square...
a market square.

04:29.621 --> 04:31.081
And the sphere...

04:31.123 --> 04:33.584
I see it and the Queen.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.294
Let's go.

04:35.335 --> 04:38.630
Wait, wait, mesa thought
wesa not rushing in.

04:38.671 --> 04:40.840
That was before we knew
where we were going.

04:40.882 --> 04:44.386
Now the chase is on.

04:55.230 --> 04:58.108
Mesa getting
a creepin' feeling here.

04:58.150 --> 05:00.527
Do not center
on your anxieties, Jar Jar.

05:00.569 --> 05:01.694
Keep moving.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.530
This way.

05:10.162 --> 05:11.497
This is it,

05:11.538 --> 05:14.958
the market square
I saw through the Force.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.543
Stay alert.

05:16.585 --> 05:18.337
The Queen may be close by.

05:18.378 --> 05:20.672
I'm going topside
for a better view.

05:22.633 --> 05:24.926
Okeyday.

05:24.968 --> 05:26.886
Uh, hello.

05:26.928 --> 05:29.722
Nope, no, thank you.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.724
Mesa already got one of those.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.435
Jar Jar, help!

05:33.477 --> 05:36.522
Huh? Julia?

05:36.563 --> 05:38.064
Jar Jar!

05:38.106 --> 05:39.065
Julia!

05:39.107 --> 05:40.651
Masteren Mace, come quick!

05:41.943 --> 05:43.612
Jar Jar, wait!

06:11.848 --> 06:13.600
Jar Jar, what in the...

06:28.156 --> 06:30.825
Mesa bet they're bringing
the Queenie this way.

06:42.629 --> 06:43.838
Help!

06:45.382 --> 06:46.425
Queenie!

06:46.466 --> 06:47.676
Jar Jar!

06:47.718 --> 06:49.219
Julia.

06:57.269 --> 06:58.645
I've got this.

06:58.687 --> 07:00.063
Keep after the Queen.

07:12.576 --> 07:15.036
Oh! Julia!

07:25.255 --> 07:26.757
Binks.

07:41.271 --> 07:43.189
Mesa need to be brave.

07:52.741 --> 07:54.993
Representative Binks.

07:55.034 --> 07:57.287
Masteren Mace,
theysa went this way!

07:57.329 --> 07:58.997
Hurry!

08:05.504 --> 08:07.922
Stop them.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.979
Oh, boy.

09:18.910 --> 09:20.746
Masteren Mace!

09:41.683 --> 09:43.976
Queenie, mesa coming!

09:44.018 --> 09:46.396
Why are you stealing
the living Force?

09:46.438 --> 09:49.900
The Shadow will come,
the Great Mother.

09:49.941 --> 09:52.193
She will deal with you, Jedi.

09:52.235 --> 09:55.363
You will see.

09:55.405 --> 09:57.657
Have a nice nap.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.373
Deysa gone.

10:05.415 --> 10:07.667
Dey speeded away
bombad fast.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.836
Wesa need some kind of ride.

10:12.255 --> 10:16.593
You're lucky
I have no time to argue.

10:20.889 --> 10:22.223
Let's get moving.

10:22.265 --> 10:23.767
Hi-ya!

10:37.029 --> 10:39.491
The appointed time draws near.

10:39.532 --> 10:42.702
The sun and the moons
are almost aligned.

10:42.744 --> 10:45.497
The Jedi is unyielding.

10:45.538 --> 10:48.207
He will arrive too late
to save the Queen.

10:48.249 --> 10:50.251
I have seen it in my visions.

10:50.293 --> 10:52.671
Once the Great Mother
is in possession of the sphere,

10:52.712 --> 10:55.966
she will combine her powers
with the living Force,

10:56.007 --> 10:58.426
and a new order will arise.

11:05.517 --> 11:07.226
Huh-wah!

11:13.107 --> 11:16.569
Hee-wah!

11:16.611 --> 11:18.780
Hee-wah!

11:18.822 --> 11:20.281
Jar Jar!
Hee-wah?

11:20.323 --> 11:21.700
Jar Jar, please.

11:21.741 --> 11:24.494
Oh, mesa sorry,
Masteren Mace.

11:24.536 --> 11:26.412
I'm just worried
about the Queenie.

11:26.454 --> 11:29.708
I understand your fears,
and I am trying to help you.

11:29.749 --> 11:32.251
But for now,
keep your mind focused

11:32.293 --> 11:33.628
on the task at hand.

11:33.670 --> 11:36.214
That is the best way
you can help your friend.

11:36.255 --> 11:39.009
Whysa you thinking
they want Queenie so badly?

11:39.049 --> 11:41.219
As the spiritual leader
of her people,

11:41.260 --> 11:44.681
the living Force inside
the Queen must be very powerful.

11:44.723 --> 11:48.518
Whoever the Great Mother is,
she wants that power.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.563
Well, wesa not let them
have Queenie's Force.

11:51.604 --> 11:53.314
No, we will not.

11:53.356 --> 11:54.983
When we get to the temple,

11:55.025 --> 11:57.610
I'll handle the guards
and whatever evil we find.

11:57.652 --> 11:59.905
You focus on the Queen.

11:59.946 --> 12:01.865
And wesa good guys
will triumph.

12:01.907 --> 12:04.116
Right, Masteren Mace?

12:06.953 --> 12:08.287
Yes.

12:26.639 --> 12:30.810
Great Mother, my visions
have come to fruition.

12:30.852 --> 12:33.605
At last, you are here.

12:33.646 --> 12:36.649
You may rise.

12:36.691 --> 12:39.986
Do you have the living sphere?

12:44.950 --> 12:49.287
I can feel the power
of the pure spirit

12:49.328 --> 12:52.331
resonating in this orb.

12:55.001 --> 12:57.503
The Jedi comes.

12:57.545 --> 12:59.881
This temple
is well protected.

12:59.923 --> 13:02.467
When they arrive,
the stone guardians

13:02.508 --> 13:03.969
will deal with them.

13:04.010 --> 13:07.931
We must begin the ritual
at once.

13:07.973 --> 13:09.099
Come.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.104
Who are you?

13:14.144 --> 13:18.817
The hour is far too late
to trouble yourself

13:18.858 --> 13:21.736
with such matters,
my dear.

13:21.778 --> 13:24.781
It may help you to know,
however,

13:24.823 --> 13:28.534
that I am not
a natural Force wielder

13:28.576 --> 13:31.621
like the Jedi or Sith.

13:31.663 --> 13:36.584
I use dark magic
to achieve power.

13:36.626 --> 13:42.841
But as a Bardottan,
you posses a strong connection

13:42.882 --> 13:45.426
to the living Force,

13:45.468 --> 13:49.472
a connection
that will now be mine.

13:49.514 --> 13:50.765
Never.

13:50.807 --> 13:53.685
I will not succumb
to your evil.

13:53.726 --> 13:56.228
How noble.

13:57.730 --> 14:01.400
Upon that tower
rests a device

14:01.442 --> 14:05.321
that can harness the energy
of the sun.

14:05.363 --> 14:07.991
When the lenses are aligned,

14:08.033 --> 14:12.495
the energy will rip
your spirit from you,

14:12.537 --> 14:16.124
and I will gather it here.

14:16.166 --> 14:22.254
With the combined power of
your spirit and my dark magic,

14:22.296 --> 14:25.383
I will become more powerful

14:25.424 --> 14:29.762
than any Sith or Jedi.

14:40.106 --> 14:41.733
I see the Queen.

14:41.774 --> 14:43.359
The ritual has started.

14:43.401 --> 14:44.986
Let's go.

14:52.618 --> 14:53.912
Oh, boy.

14:53.953 --> 14:56.831
Masteren Mace!
Masteren Mace!

14:58.791 --> 14:59.959
Oh, nosa!

15:00.001 --> 15:02.420
Demons!

15:02.461 --> 15:04.005
Get behind me.

15:14.306 --> 15:16.726
Mesa needen
some help back here!

15:20.271 --> 15:23.191
Whoa!
Whoa!

15:31.783 --> 15:34.619
Whoasa! Whoasa!

15:40.875 --> 15:42.961
Jar Jar, are you...

15:43.002 --> 15:44.378
okay?

15:44.420 --> 15:47.298
Look, mesa found
a bang booma gun.

15:47.339 --> 15:49.050
Nice work.

15:57.183 --> 16:00.019
The Jedi have defeated
the stone guardians.

16:01.312 --> 16:04.023
You mean the Jedi
and the Gungan.

16:04.065 --> 16:05.399
Jar Jar!

16:05.441 --> 16:07.277
Mesa here, Queenie.

16:07.318 --> 16:09.320
Master Windu.

16:09.361 --> 16:12.323
I assume
you are the Great Mother.

16:12.364 --> 16:17.996
No, I am a simple witch,
not worth the trouble

16:18.037 --> 16:22.041
or attention
of the great Jedi Order.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.542
A Nightsister.

16:27.255 --> 16:28.840
Get the Queen.

16:30.842 --> 16:32.051
Oh, boy!

16:42.436 --> 16:47.025
Your power is no match
for my magicks.

16:47.066 --> 16:50.320
Magic is only an illusion.

17:14.051 --> 17:15.386
Hurry, Jar Jar.

17:27.732 --> 17:29.067
Oh!

17:31.152 --> 17:33.238
Let go.

18:35.258 --> 18:37.051
Jar Jar.

18:37.093 --> 18:39.053
I knew you would save me.

18:39.095 --> 18:42.056
Mesa never let anything
happen to you, Queenie.

18:42.098 --> 18:46.311
Jar Jar, your highness, over here.

18:52.358 --> 18:55.278
I saw the witch
when I looked into the Force.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.780
Jar Jar, I wanted to tell you.

18:57.822 --> 19:00.658
I knew you would stop her.

19:00.699 --> 19:03.702
You should be thanking Masteren Mace.

19:03.744 --> 19:07.706
Jedi Master, I owe you my life.

19:07.748 --> 19:11.836
It is my privilege
to serve you, Queen Julia.

19:11.877 --> 19:13.587
Perhaps this is a new beginning

19:13.629 --> 19:15.881
for the Bardottans and the Jedi.

19:15.923 --> 19:18.843
Perhaps.

19:18.884 --> 19:22.013
Hee-wah!

19:22.054 --> 19:24.515
Hee-wah!
