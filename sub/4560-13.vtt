Lilly, college is not all
about decorating your room.

It's about getting an education
and expanding your mind.

Now, with that being said,
which one of these fake glasses

00:31.602 --> 00:34.305

more higherly educated?

Miley, if you're going to be
using the phrase "more higherly
educated" at Stanford

at North Carolina

11:21.451 --> 11:24.354

that she's rooming with

a more tolerant and
compassionate person,

11:40.270 --> 11:44.134

the most valuable lesson
that she learns in college.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.029
No, still don't get it.

32:10.029 --> 32:14.703
Maybe you're right. When
Lilly's fishing for something,
she adds a "Pff" at the end.

32:14.703 --> 32:16.265
Oh, no.

32:18.237 --> 32:21.510
You go away to Paris
to do a stupid movie, and you
can't even speak French?

32:21.510 --> 32:22.711
Pff.

32:22.711 --> 32:25.374
- [tape rewinds]
- Pff.

32:25.374 --> 32:27.546
- [tape rewinds]
- Pff.

32:29.378 --> 32:33.422
See? She did a "pff," but it was
delayed. It was a delayed "pff."

32:33.422 --> 32:34.653
A delayed "pff?"

32:34.653 --> 32:37.686
Yes, a delayed "pff."
That's why I didn't see it.

32:37.686 --> 32:39.488
Jackson, you're right. I gotta
go talk to her.

32:39.488 --> 32:42.161
- Thank you. You're a genius.
- [chuckles] You're welcome.

32:42.161 --> 32:45.264
I don't know what I did.
But you're welcome.

32:46.595 --> 32:51.170
I don't wanna know why.
I don't wanna know how.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.103
I just wanna enjoy this moment
for as long as it lasts.

32:57.506 --> 32:59.708
[sighs] Much better.

33:01.580 --> 33:06.715
Now it's time for the stupid
collage of stupid times
with stupid Miley...

33:06.715 --> 33:09.688
Oh, hey, that was that time
we went pumpkin carving.
That was really fun.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.990
No it wasn't! [sighs]

33:11.990 --> 33:13.122
Lilly?

33:14.463 --> 33:18.027
[sighs] I know the real reason
you're mad at me.

33:18.027 --> 33:21.070
Oh, really? What was your
first clue, when I told you?

33:21.070 --> 33:24.703
No. I said "the real reason"
little miss "pff."

33:25.774 --> 33:28.677
- What?
- I may have given you the pat,

33:28.677 --> 33:32.010
but you gave me the "pff."
And I know why.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.682
It's 'cause I didn't ask you
to go to Paris with me.

33:33.682 --> 33:36.215
[sighs] Well, it sure
took you long enough.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.746
Hey, it was a delayed "pff."

33:37.746 --> 33:40.289
I had a delayed reaction.
You're being a little unfair.

33:40.289 --> 33:43.122
I'm being unfair? First you
lie to me about the movie,

33:43.122 --> 33:45.054
and then you don't even
want me to come with you?

33:45.054 --> 33:47.196
Look, Lilly, of course
I want you to go with me.

33:47.196 --> 33:48.497
It's just... I didn't ask

33:48.497 --> 33:50.099
'cause I know how much
college means to you.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.463
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:54.463 --> 33:57.466
Well, you could've
at least asked.

33:58.607 --> 34:00.239
Is it too late?

34:02.641 --> 34:04.073
Try me.

34:04.073 --> 34:05.814
Lilly, do you want
to go to Paris with me?

34:05.814 --> 34:08.817
[sighs] No.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.821
No? Why'd you
make me ask you?

34:12.821 --> 34:15.554
Because I needed to hear it.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.328
I need to know that this
friendship means as much
to you as it does to me.

34:19.328 --> 34:21.190
And I can't put off college.

34:21.190 --> 34:22.831
Why not, Lilly? Come on,
picture it. Think about it.

34:22.831 --> 34:25.664
When we're in Europe. I mean,
all the culture and the history,

34:25.664 --> 34:30.839
and the language. It'll be
an educational experience
that is fantastique.

34:30.839 --> 34:33.242
That's "fantastic" in French.

34:33.242 --> 34:35.804
- Miley, come on.
- No, I'm serious.

34:35.804 --> 34:37.646
Think about it, next year,
in class, when they're talking

34:37.646 --> 34:39.447
about the Golden
Arches of Triumph,

34:39.447 --> 34:42.511
we'll have actually
been there.

34:42.511 --> 34:46.755
It's the Arc de Triomphe.
 It's not someplace you drive
through to get fries.

34:46.755 --> 34:48.617
French fries. Hey.

34:50.188 --> 34:53.292
Come on, Lilly. Not only
will it be an amazing
learning experience,

34:53.292 --> 34:56.695
but you'll be around
Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg.

Can't have lunch with you
today but try me tomorrow!"

Well...

35:03.772 --> 35:06.104
Come on, your folks'll
be cool with it.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.338
I don't know! I mean,
I always thought,

35:09.338 --> 35:11.540
you know, you go to high school
and then you go to college

35:11.540 --> 35:13.712
but I guess people
do take time off.

35:13.712 --> 35:17.516
And an opportunity like this, I
mean, it is kind of fantastique.

35:19.288 --> 35:20.819
Do you really want
me to go with you?

35:20.819 --> 35:22.451
More than anything.

35:23.752 --> 35:25.524
Well, then,
how can I say no?

35:25.524 --> 35:27.556

- I got you something.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.308
Used lip balm.

43:01.349 --> 43:04.012
Uh, it has my kisses
all over it.

43:04.012 --> 43:06.915
- Oh!
- What's up, dude?

43:06.915 --> 43:08.687
Really?

43:08.687 --> 43:12.260
OK, guys. We only have a little
while with our boyfriends,

43:12.260 --> 43:14.663
so let's not waste the time
with you guys fighting over
your girlfriends,

43:14.663 --> 43:16.965
like a really cute
gladiator and...

43:16.965 --> 43:19.067
- ...Oliver.
- Hey!

43:19.067 --> 43:21.269
I'll have you know plenty
of girls on tour find me...

43:21.269 --> 43:23.301
What? They find you what?

43:23.301 --> 43:27.676
Incredibly...
faithful to you.

43:27.676 --> 43:29.007
That's my guy.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.709
OK, so we're gonna leave you two

43:30.709 --> 43:32.380
to do your kissy-mushy
thing over here

43:32.380 --> 43:35.243
and we'll go do ours by the
inflatable neck-pillow cart.
Bye.

43:37.185 --> 43:39.988
Man! I can't believe
you're going to Paris.

43:39.988 --> 43:42.120
I know. It's all
happening so fast.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.222
I've been cramming
to learn French all week,

43:44.222 --> 43:47.255
but, you know, I do think I have
the most important phrase down.

43:47.255 --> 43:50.258
"Back off, I have a big, strong
boyfriend back in America?"

43:50.258 --> 43:54.763
Uh, close. It's, um...
[speaks French]

43:56.264 --> 43:58.837
I love you too, Lilly.

44:10.679 --> 44:12.220
Oh, well, I gotta get
to my flight.

44:12.220 --> 44:14.082
Tell Miley I said good luck
on the movie, OK?

44:14.082 --> 44:16.084
- OK.
- Call me as soon as you land.

44:16.084 --> 44:17.926
Uh-huh.

44:17.926 --> 44:21.359
Oh, Lil, look. Those girls
are going to Stanford.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.231
That'll be you
and Miley next year.

44:23.231 --> 44:24.362
Yeah.

44:24.362 --> 44:27.435
Unless she books another
blockbuster movie or something.

44:29.267 --> 44:30.799
Yeah.

44:32.300 --> 44:35.373
- I miss you already.
- Bye.
