Wow, this is awesome.

01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:07.800
NATE:
<i>And my grandma, she's a fighter.</i>

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.260
<i>She tries to bring everybody</i>
<i>back together.</i>

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.350
<i>It don't always work, but she never fails.</i>

01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:13.600
<i>She's gonna try.</i>

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.940
To a sense, I do accept
taking responsibility of that land,

01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:20.150
'cause that's
where I want to raise my kids at.

01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:21.820
That's where I want to be at.

01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:24.490
So when it comes time, I feel
I'll probably be one of the only ones

01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:27.380
that puts up a fight,
and I'm not gonna be able to do it alone.

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:31.240
<i>If they win the land back,</i>
<i>I see it going great.</i>

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.790
<i>'Cause Uncle Melvin is</i>
<i>already talking about</i>

01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:34.460
<i>his plans of building a fish house,</i>

01:28:34.650 --> 01:28:37.670
<i>making sure we got fuel, ice,</i>
<i>all the things that he had before,</i>

01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:39.630
<i>he said he wants to do it again.</i>

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:43.760
<i>I see everybody in the family</i>
<i>coming back to commercial fishing again</i>

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.550
so we never have to go to fish houses
and get cheated.

so we got scared and wouldn't eat them,

but we caught on to her and said,
"Wait a second,

01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:49.900
that ain't no poison, that's flour.
That's okay."
