10:15.734 --> 10:17.767
I'M SORRY, GUYS,
BUT ZACK HAS TO LEARN

10:17.767 --> 10:19.000
THAT THERE ARE RULES
AND WHEN YOU BREAK THEM,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.367
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.

10:20.367 --> 10:22.300

12:13.367 --> 12:14.367
REGULAR HEAD.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.567
FLAT HEAD.

12:16.567 --> 12:18.600
BORED OUT OF MY HEAD.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.400
SORRY.
YOUR MOM SAID NO FUN.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.367
WELL, WHAT AM I

12:23.367 --> 12:24.834
I FINISHED MY HOMEWORK.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.734
OH, WHY DON'T YOU GO
OVER WHAT YOU DID,

12:26.734 --> 12:28.567
AND, YOU KNOW,

12:28.567 --> 12:29.600
AH, COME ON.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.800
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
I HAD TO DO IT ONCE.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.400
HEY!

12:36.400 --> 12:38.200

12:40.100 --> 12:42.900
ARWIN, YOU BOWL?

12:42.900 --> 12:44.100
NO, NO, NO.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.000
I FOUND THAT IN THE TRASH.
MAKES A GREAT PAPERWEIGHT.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.867
BUT--BUT IT SAYS,

12:47.867 --> 12:49.367
"FIRST PLACE,
ARWIN HOCK HAUSER."

12:49.367 --> 12:52.033
THAT'S--MY SISTER.

IT'S HER TROPHY.
SHE WON IT, AHEM.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.133
SHE HAS THE SAME
FIRST NAME AS YOU?

12:57.133 --> 12:59.934
WE WERE A POOR FAMILY.

12:59.934 --> 13:02.500
WE COULD ONLY
AFFORD ONE NAME.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.767
BUT IT--

13:03.767 --> 13:05.000
OK, I CONFESS!

13:05.000 --> 13:07.700
OH, STOP BADGERING ME.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

13:07.700 --> 13:11.200

13:16.667 --> 13:17.867
I TRAVELED THE CIRCUIT,

13:17.867 --> 13:19.767
HUNG WITH THE CHAMPIONS.

13:19.767 --> 13:22.100
THEY SAID I
COULD HAVE BEEN
A HALL-OF-FAMER BUT...

13:22.100 --> 13:23.367
BUT WHAT?

13:23.367 --> 13:25.367
BUT THEN THERE CAME...

13:29.133 --> 13:30.700
THAT NIGHT.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.667
THIS WAS THE NATIONAL FINALS,

13:34.667 --> 13:36.734

PROFESSIONAL BOWLERS.

13:44.834 --> 13:46.400
AHH.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.800
THOSE WERE THE DAYS.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.467
ANYWAY, MOTHER HAD
NEVER SEEN ME BOWL BEFORE,

13:50.467 --> 13:52.967
BUT HER ARM-WRESTLING
MATCH GOT POSTPONED.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.734
SO, SHE CAME TO SUPPORT
ME IN THE FINALS,

13:54.734 --> 13:57.734
AS ONLY A MOTHER CAN.

13:57.734 --> 14:00.467
Mother:
ARWIN! COME ON!
DO IT!

14:00.467 --> 14:02.400
TRY AND MAKE
SOMETHING OUT
OF YOURSELF!

14:02.400 --> 14:05.200
DON'T BE A LOSER
LIKE YOUR FATHER!

14:05.200 --> 14:08.834
MOM WAS GIVING ME A PEP
TALK FROM THE SIDELINES.

14:08.834 --> 14:11.300
Mother:
YOU BETTER WIN!

14:11.300 --> 14:12.600
I WAS UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.800
Zack: WHAT HAPPENED?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.367
MY HAND WAS
SWEATING SO MUCH

14:16.367 --> 14:17.834
THAT I LOST IT
ON THE BACK SWING.

14:17.834 --> 14:19.867
[CRASH]
Mother: AAH!

14:24.367 --> 14:25.934
UGH.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.033
I LOST THE MATCH.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.400
I LOST THE
CHAMPIONSHIP,
AND MOTHER...

14:29.400 --> 14:31.200
SHE LOST A FOOT.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.400
OH, MY GOSH.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
DOES SHE WALK
WITH A LIMP?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.567
OH, NO, NO, NO. THE BALL
ACTUALLY LANDED ON HER HEAD.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.500
SHE LOST A FOOT.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.200
SHE WAS 6 FEET,
NOW SHE'S 5 FEET.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.133
THAT MATH I CAN DO.

14:42.133 --> 14:44.734
WELL,
AFTER THE ACCIDENT I...

14:44.734 --> 14:47.567
HUNG UP MY BOWLING BALL
AND SHOES AND...

14:47.567 --> 14:49.233
I HAVEN'T BOWLED SINCE.

14:49.233 --> 14:52.200
ARWIN, IF YOU'RE
A GOOD BOWLER,

14:52.200 --> 14:53.867
YOU COULD TAKE MY
PLACE IN THE MATCH

14:53.867 --> 14:55.233
AGAINST THE
ST. MARK HOTEL.

14:55.233 --> 14:56.300
OUR TEAM NEEDS YOU!

14:56.300 --> 14:57.400
NO, NO, NO.
I CAN'T.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.367
SURE YOU CAN.
NO, NO, NO. I CAN'T.

14:59.367 --> 15:01.233
I SWORE I WOULD
NEVER PICK UP A
BOWLING BALL AGAIN.

15:01.233 --> 15:05.467
ARWIN, FACING YOUR FEARS
HELPS YOU GROW AS A PERSON.

15:05.467 --> 15:08.100
ZACK...

15:08.100 --> 15:09.767
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

15:09.767 --> 15:11.133
BUT, UH,
I'M A GROWN MAN

15:11.133 --> 15:14.467
WITHOUT A
GIRLFRIEND LIVING
IN A BASEMENT.

15:14.467 --> 15:18.000

ISN'T EXACTLY MY FORTE.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.400
PLEASE?

15:20.400 --> 15:23.834
I REALLY MESSED UP
AND LET THE TEAM DOWN.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.600
IF WE LOSE
TO THE ST. MARK,

15:25.600 --> 15:27.400
EVERYONE IS
GOING TO HATE ME.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.667
BUMMER!

15:31.967 --> 15:33.400
I'M PRETTY SURE IF WE WON,

16:07.900 --> 16:10.000
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY
TO THROW HER OFF HER GAME,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
TO DISTRACT HER.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.500
DON'T WORRY.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.200
FOR THE GOOD
OF THE TEAM...

16:15.200 --> 16:16.500
