02:17.736 --> 02:21.672
NEW KIDS TURBO

02:15.112 --> 02:17.069
That fucking butterfly.

02:46.002 --> 02:49.403
So what, dude! It's not my bike.

02:50.778 --> 02:52.152
I stole it from that cunt.

02:53.070 --> 02:56.194
That homo on Horzik Street.
The short, cross- eyed one.

02:56.528 --> 02:59.152
Dude, I told him not to ride
on my street.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.486
And what does he do?
He does it anyway.

03:01.653 --> 03:04.861
So I see him coming as I'm waiting
in the bushes. Dude, I jump out...

03:16.820 --> 03:18.736
That's my grill, cunt!

03:18.903 --> 03:21.486
It's all bent! Do you know
how much that costs?

03:25.320 --> 03:26.986
It's all good.

03:27.737 --> 03:29.444
I don't feel anything.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.027
I'm doing great!

03:36.237 --> 03:37.444
I'm hungry.

03:40.403 --> 03:42.361
Just as the economy
seemed to be recovering...

03:42.528 --> 03:43.944
...we're looking at yet
another bad forecast.

03:44.278 --> 03:47.652
Economists predict a second,
even bigger crisis...

03:47.820 --> 03:50.194
...named 'The Black Hole',
which will mainly affect this region.

03:50.695 --> 03:53.444
Difficult times may be ahead
for the people of Brabant.

03:53.612 --> 03:57.486
I'll keep you informed. I'm Peter Vernhout,
reporting from 's Hertogenbosch...

03:58.737 --> 04:00.319
Look at this.

04:00.528 --> 04:02.194
Jody Bernal's coming to Maaskantje!

04:03.028 --> 04:04.819
Who would go and see that?

04:04.987 --> 04:07.236
Que si, que no!

04:07.862 --> 04:09.527
Such a homo.

04:11.528 --> 04:15.236
Two grizzly's, noodles,
a fried sausage...

04:16.987 --> 04:21.569
...two Ricky Martins with peanut sauce,
turkey stick, a Sloppy Joe,

04:21.737 --> 04:25.611
...and a sausage roll,
a large order of chicken nuggets...

04:25.778 --> 04:27.819
...and bakpaos.

04:31.112 --> 04:32.236
Hey Henk.

04:33.278 --> 04:35.361
You forgot my fried chicken!

04:35.653 --> 04:38.486
- You didn't put your order in.
- I did, dude.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.902
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

04:41.070 --> 04:43.277
You mongoloid!

04:45.695 --> 04:48.486
Truck driver! Honk, honk.

04:53.778 --> 04:55.152
Hey cunt! We're done!

04:56.112 --> 04:57.152
We got it.

04:58.487 --> 04:59.652
Take care!

05:06.987 --> 05:10.611
Hey Robbie, can I have one?

05:10.820 --> 05:14.111
Are you kidding me?
I haven't eaten all day, cunt!

05:18.403 --> 05:20.819
Seasoned meat. He likes that.

05:25.778 --> 05:29.069
Stay away from my nuggets, cunt!

05:35.820 --> 05:38.736
Good afternoon gentlemen.
What's going on here?

05:39.862 --> 05:41.611
We're drinking beer.

05:42.987 --> 05:45.718
According to regional law
that is prohibited.

05:45.844 --> 05:47.194
So hand over those beers, guys.

05:47.362 --> 05:48.527
No.

05:49.278 --> 05:52.361
Come on guys. Give me those beers
or I will have to take you in.

05:53.070 --> 05:54.152
Hey dickhead!

05:55.528 --> 05:58.069
- You feel like running?
- Excuse me?

06:12.362 --> 06:14.069
Nice...

06:14.445 --> 06:16.194
...it's the weekend.

06:17.612 --> 06:20.527
Bullshit. It's Tuesday, cunt!

06:24.612 --> 06:27.152
No dude, it's Sunday!

06:33.445 --> 06:36.652
Fuck!

07:47.028 --> 07:49.736
Hey! What are you doing?

07:51.070 --> 07:53.486
- What?
- What are you doing?

07:54.112 --> 07:55.402
Can't...

07:56.195 --> 07:58.444
- What?
- Easy dude.

07:58.945 --> 08:01.902
I always lift TV's like that.

08:02.070 --> 08:04.277
No worries, dude. I bet...

08:04.445 --> 08:09.069
...it will work when
you plug it back in.

08:09.612 --> 08:11.902
- What do you mean 'no worries'?
- No, no, no.

08:12.153 --> 08:13.486
I swear.

08:13.653 --> 08:14.819
I swear to you!

08:21.612 --> 08:22.736
Hey, homo.

08:24.403 --> 08:26.319
What you're going to do is...

08:26.778 --> 08:28.402
You are going home.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.944
And you're not coming back here.

08:42.195 --> 08:43.611
What are you doing here?

08:43.903 --> 08:46.527
Checking up on you guys.

08:47.612 --> 08:49.694
Where are the gardening hoes?

08:53.403 --> 08:55.444
What kind of an ugly thing is that?

08:57.445 --> 08:59.152
That's Gradje!

08:59.320 --> 09:02.652
Whatever.
You don't bring it to work, you idiot!

09:02.820 --> 09:05.486
- He ruined that gardening hoe.
- Yeah. So what?

09:05.653 --> 09:07.361
'So what?'

09:14.487 --> 09:16.319
You know what, dude?

09:17.528 --> 09:20.986
You and your fucking dog are fired.

09:21.195 --> 09:23.152
And you too, Robbie.

09:26.737 --> 09:29.986
Don't talk that way about my dog, cunt!

09:31.153 --> 09:33.611
You can stick that job up your ass.

09:33.862 --> 09:36.444
I'll go and get unemployment benefits.

09:36.612 --> 09:38.027
Yeah, you cunt!

09:50.570 --> 09:51.819
Hey, Rikkert!

09:52.695 --> 09:54.236
You're fired, cunt.

10:00.362 --> 10:03.736
Hey, Rikkert, just joking.
It's a joke.

10:04.153 --> 10:05.569
Hey, Rikkert!

10:05.862 --> 10:07.902
But you are fired.

10:08.862 --> 10:10.402
I can only keep the best.

10:16.945 --> 10:20.527
And I fucked your mother in the ass.
Just so you know.

10:21.028 --> 10:24.069
Now go away, Rikkert. Get out, Rikkert.

10:25.445 --> 10:27.152
Say hi to your mother.

10:52.612 --> 10:55.194
Headlines: Mass dismisssal
caused by financial crisis

10:55.362 --> 10:58.736
I got fired today too!
Dammit! That fucking crisis!

10:59.112 --> 11:02.111
Anyway, I think you should
start working more.

11:02.278 --> 11:03.694
Are you crazy?

11:03.862 --> 11:08.402
I'm already at the grocery store six
days a week. How much more could I work?

11:09.403 --> 11:11.652
I don't know. Seven days?

11:12.487 --> 11:17.236
What have you done in the last three
months that you've been living here?

11:17.445 --> 11:20.777
I haven't gotten laid. That's for sure.
-What?

11:20.945 --> 11:22.944
What? Am I right?

11:23.195 --> 11:27.777
We've been together for thirteen weeks.
And I'm only allowed to use my fingers.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.902
What? Am I right?
You will have a finger, but not a cock.

11:34.403 --> 11:36.777
It's not like you're still a virgin.

11:47.695 --> 11:50.819
See? Nothing. This is not working.

11:51.403 --> 11:53.569
Call me when you're ready to fuck!

12:00.028 --> 12:02.569
Jody Bernal is coming to Maaskantje

12:23.695 --> 12:27.444
- Do I smell poop?
- It's the bakpao he just had.

12:39.528 --> 12:43.069
Can I stay here?
I got into trouble with my hoe.

12:43.237 --> 12:44.736
Hoe!

12:47.945 --> 12:49.652
It's all good, dude.

13:22.278 --> 13:25.527
Dammit! That was the best part
of the show.

13:27.028 --> 13:29.277
You are foul-mouthed.

13:30.112 --> 13:34.236
I work, maybe you should too.
Find a new job.

13:34.903 --> 13:36.319
I can't see.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.027
What are you doing?

13:56.278 --> 13:59.236
You are worthless.

13:59.403 --> 14:03.152
You are a weak homo,
just like your father.

14:04.570 --> 14:07.902
That's why he left you.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.736
Dude, what are you doing?

14:25.403 --> 14:28.152
Can I stay with you for a while?

14:28.320 --> 14:31.986
My mom is giving me a hard time,
you know. I'll be good.

14:32.445 --> 14:33.777
You know me.

14:39.862 --> 14:43.027
Get off that couch!
That's my spot, dude.

14:50.028 --> 14:52.111
Nice ottoman, right?

14:55.820 --> 14:59.569
We are live at Gerstakker in
Maaskantje, where there's a fire.

14:59.737 --> 15:02.819
After attempting to extinguish
the fire, the firefighters...

15:02.987 --> 15:06.944
...had to let the home burn down.
We have no information on the tenants.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.986
All we know is that there's
a strong cannabis smell.

15:11.153 --> 15:13.611
I will keep you informed.
This is Peter Vernhout...

15:21.362 --> 15:24.277
Awesome! All buds.

15:26.653 --> 15:29.236
You can stay here too.

15:31.570 --> 15:32.861
Sorry.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.152
Watch me! Watch me!

15:47.903 --> 15:51.652
I got my unemployment check.
Money for free, dude.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.986
Let's buy stuff!

16:13.237 --> 16:14.277
Hey.

16:16.903 --> 16:18.611
You're not even responding.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.527
Fine. Whatever.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.861
That's 112 euros and 16 cents.

16:32.195 --> 16:33.527
You said 112, right?

16:33.695 --> 16:34.986
Yes, 112.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.736
That's no problem.

16:37.903 --> 16:41.152
You can make it 150.

16:53.070 --> 16:56.027
What a bitch. She can whine...

16:56.195 --> 16:58.194
...but she can't fuck.

16:58.362 --> 17:00.319
What is her problem?

17:00.903 --> 17:04.402
Let it go, dude. Go fuck other chicks.

17:04.569 --> 17:08.069
Maybe one without kids,
one who isn't pregnant.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.319
I'm loving this. Hanging out all day.

17:11.487 --> 17:15.319
I just need to fill out the papers
for more free money.

17:15.487 --> 17:17.194
That's what I was thinking.

17:18.819 --> 17:23.861
Gentlemen at pump two,
please put out your cigarettes.

17:24.903 --> 17:27.027
Thank you... for that.

17:31.070 --> 17:33.486
Can you pay for this?

17:33.653 --> 17:36.152
I just got work done on the car.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.569
Of course.

17:43.112 --> 17:46.819
That's 94 euros, please.

17:47.195 --> 17:48.652
Get me a carton, dude.

17:54.153 --> 17:57.527
That will be 132 euros, please.

17:59.903 --> 18:01.652
CARD DECLlNED

18:01.820 --> 18:04.277
O, my god. What happened?

18:05.028 --> 18:07.111
I go and buy some stuff
and my money is gone?

18:08.278 --> 18:12.319
How much do I get from those
dickheads? I can't live like this.

18:12.487 --> 18:14.569
Hey... Dries.

18:15.695 --> 18:19.236
I owe you this one. We have to go.

18:21.445 --> 18:22.694
Take care!

18:30.778 --> 18:32.861
Social Security Office

18:33.237 --> 18:35.402
I'm not getting enough money, dude.

18:35.862 --> 18:37.402
I understand.

18:37.570 --> 18:39.361
I want you to write down our names.

18:41.237 --> 18:43.277
Richard Batsbak.

18:43.778 --> 18:45.527
Robbie Schuurmans.

18:46.070 --> 18:47.861
Rikkert Biemans.

18:48.028 --> 18:49.736
Barrie Butsers.

18:50.445 --> 18:54.277
And also include that ugly ass
Gerrie van Boven while you're at it.

18:54.695 --> 18:57.736
Sure. And what can I do for you?

18:58.112 --> 19:01.694
What do you think?
You need to give us more money, cunt!

19:02.195 --> 19:04.944
Unfortunately
I won't be able to do that.

19:09.820 --> 19:12.652
Give us more money, cunt!

19:35.987 --> 19:39.652
'Dear Mr. R. Batsbak...

19:40.570 --> 19:44.069
As a result of the serious threats...

19:44.237 --> 19:48.194
...addressed to our main office...

19:48.403 --> 19:50.902
...we need to inform you...

19:58.487 --> 20:02.819
We need to inform you that as of
today you won't be receiving...

20:02.987 --> 20:04.944
...unemployment benefits.

20:05.112 --> 20:09.444
This also applies to
Mr. R. Schuurmans...

20:09.612 --> 20:12.694
...Mr. R. Biemans, Mr. B. Butsers...

20:12.862 --> 20:14.111
...Mr. G. Van Boven.

20:14.570 --> 20:18.486
Kind regards, Chairman of the Board.'

20:22.778 --> 20:24.194
Goddammit!

20:25.195 --> 20:27.694
None of us are getting any money.

20:27.903 --> 20:30.777
If they want to play hard ball,
that's fine.

20:30.945 --> 20:35.152
Then I won't be paying
for anything anymore!

20:38.403 --> 20:39.444
What?

20:39.612 --> 20:43.402
We won't be paying
for anything anymore!

20:44.195 --> 20:45.361
Yes!

20:57.695 --> 20:58.944
Last warning

21:03.028 --> 21:04.902
- I don't see anything.
- Over there, dude.

21:06.612 --> 21:07.694
Hey!

21:09.862 --> 21:14.319
If I ever see you here again,
I will kill you, cunt!

21:15.820 --> 21:17.152
Public Prosecutor

21:17.528 --> 21:20.861
Chinese? Get me a Chinese
rice table for five persons.

21:22.487 --> 21:24.277
That's 89 euros and 20 cents.

21:24.570 --> 21:26.069
I don't have any money.

21:27.112 --> 21:28.569
Goddammit!

21:38.653 --> 21:40.611
- Mister Batsbak?
- Yes.

21:41.153 --> 21:43.194
- R. Batsbak?
- All right.

21:43.362 --> 21:46.027
You have a delinquent balance on...

21:46.195 --> 21:48.027
Truck driver.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.652
Ok, but...

21:55.403 --> 21:57.277
Here's the door.

21:59.237 --> 22:01.861
Good job, dude. Here's some money.

22:02.028 --> 22:03.569
Ok, thanks.

22:12.028 --> 22:15.069
- Are you Richard Batsbak?
- Yes. So?

22:15.237 --> 22:17.736
Mister Batsbak. Finally.

22:17.903 --> 22:20.902
I'm with the collection agency,
and I have some bad news.

22:21.070 --> 22:25.819
You haven't responded
to our payment reminders.

22:25.987 --> 22:27.986
Regarding your delinquent balance.

22:28.153 --> 22:29.194
And?

22:29.737 --> 22:32.652
And? As a result you
now only have two days...

22:32.820 --> 22:36.861
- I won't pay for anything anymore.
- You won't pay?

22:37.987 --> 22:39.569
That's not how it works.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.361
Are you deaf?
I don't have money, cunt!

22:43.653 --> 22:46.736
And if I had it, you wouldn't get it,
you asshole!

22:47.112 --> 22:49.069
Now, get out of here!

22:51.737 --> 22:53.527
We can't tolerate that, sir.

22:53.945 --> 22:55.902
We will take care of it.

22:56.070 --> 22:59.111
It's going to be all right.
Make a left here, you said?

23:01.862 --> 23:03.277
You, again?

23:03.445 --> 23:04.569
Wait.

23:05.987 --> 23:09.444
Leave me alone, dude.
You had to run to the cops.

23:09.612 --> 23:13.402
I don't have the money,
so you can't get it from me, cunt!

23:16.820 --> 23:22.402
Good afternoon. In Maaskantje a person
has decided to stop paying for anything.

23:22.653 --> 23:28.319
When an officer and a bill collector
tried to change his mind...

23:28.737 --> 23:32.444
...he made it very clear
that they were not welcome.

23:32.778 --> 23:36.819
This is a man who refuses
to pay off his debt.

23:37.070 --> 23:39.819
And he can't get away with that.

23:40.487 --> 23:43.027
So I'm assuming
he hasn't been arrested?

23:43.195 --> 23:45.444
That's correct.

23:45.778 --> 23:48.736
But again, he won't get away with this.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.277
If we would all behave this way,
we would have chaos.

23:52.612 --> 23:56.069
That cop got smashed.
Look at his black eye.

23:56.237 --> 23:58.152
Pussy!

23:59.403 --> 24:01.069
Dickhead!

24:01.362 --> 24:04.402
How do you deal with the situation?

24:05.903 --> 24:08.361
I'm just doing my job.

24:11.278 --> 24:15.944
This unusual event has shocked
the quiet town of Maaskantje.

24:16.112 --> 24:19.652
This is Peter Vernhout,
reporting live from Maaskantje.

24:19.820 --> 24:22.777
Hey, Henk. What about
my four bakpaos, dude?

24:23.278 --> 24:27.027
My god. You, again?
Get your asses out of here!

24:27.320 --> 24:30.027
My face is burned
because of you, ugly cunt!

24:30.195 --> 24:34.236
Easy, dude. Get your hands off Gerrie!

24:34.528 --> 24:35.944
That's right!

24:36.320 --> 24:39.527
Easy, dude. Just give us the food,
and put it on our tab.

24:39.778 --> 24:42.069
You don't have a tab!

24:42.237 --> 24:44.569
Get out, goddammit!

24:46.320 --> 24:48.777
Easy, dude. With you AlDS-face!

24:50.028 --> 24:51.402
Out!

24:53.487 --> 24:54.819
Where is Rikkert?

25:05.237 --> 25:06.277
Who is he?

25:08.153 --> 25:10.069
This is The Dave.

25:10.487 --> 25:11.569
Want some XTC?

25:12.028 --> 25:14.902
- What did you say?
- Want to buy some XTC?

25:15.070 --> 25:18.027
Some diamonds or mitsubitchis?

25:18.195 --> 25:22.611
You're probably interested in
the old school stuff. The ones...

25:22.778 --> 25:24.986
...that make you tweak, right?

25:26.862 --> 25:28.152
I got those.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.236
He's my new boyfriend.
He's from Schijndel.

25:34.737 --> 25:36.611
Goddammit. Already?

25:36.778 --> 25:38.111
You fucking whore!

25:38.445 --> 25:40.986
You know what?

25:41.237 --> 25:44.111
Two can play that game.
I'm going to fuck other girls.

25:44.278 --> 25:45.944
No problem, dude!

25:46.862 --> 25:48.402
Take care...

25:49.237 --> 25:50.527
...you whore!

25:59.070 --> 26:00.736
Such a whore!

26:03.487 --> 26:06.319
Hi baby, are you horny?

26:06.487 --> 26:08.486
I am so horny.

26:08.653 --> 26:12.486
Good. I want to fuck you.
Can't we meet somewhere?

26:12.653 --> 26:14.861
Are you in the area?
In Maaskantje?

26:15.028 --> 26:19.444
Can't we chat for a bit? I want
to feel you inside my shaved pussy.

26:19.612 --> 26:23.694
That's nice.
But can't you come here?

26:23.862 --> 26:25.694
So I can fuck you,
and then you can leave.

26:25.862 --> 26:28.819
I want you to fuck me in my ass.
Very hard and deep.

26:28.987 --> 26:32.111
You sound like a big boy.
Oh, you're so big.

26:33.070 --> 26:35.527
Yes, you stupid whore.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.027
I told you to come meet me, goddammit.

26:38.195 --> 26:40.236
Maaskantje, close to
Den Dungen, you know.

26:40.403 --> 26:42.902
Oh, I'm so horny.

26:46.945 --> 26:48.736
Never mind!

26:48.903 --> 26:51.027
You stupid whore!

26:53.612 --> 26:57.194
Adrie, you are a police officer.

26:57.778 --> 27:00.819
You have to show them authority.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.694
Nobody will take us seriously.

27:02.987 --> 27:07.444
Dickheads! Let me out of here.
I didn't rob anybody.

27:07.612 --> 27:09.152
Joost van Gaalen again?

27:09.320 --> 27:12.777
We have forces coming in
from Schijndel.

27:12.945 --> 27:15.277
And we're going to get
these guys, understood?

27:16.487 --> 27:17.736
I got it.

27:30.278 --> 27:32.819
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

27:36.528 --> 27:39.152
We're with Brabant TV.

27:39.695 --> 27:43.277
My name is Peter Vernhout.
And this is Rene.

27:43.987 --> 27:46.194
Rene is our cameraman.

27:47.820 --> 27:53.442
We were wondering if we
could ask you a few questions?

27:53.553 --> 27:54.494
What for?

27:54.612 --> 27:59.111
We did an interview here earlier. You
know, with your local police officer.

27:59.237 --> 28:03.819
- How much do we get for it?
- Well, that's not how it works.

28:03.987 --> 28:05.944
Forty euros!

28:07.112 --> 28:10.902
That's a reasonable amount.
I think we can do that.

28:11.070 --> 28:13.402
- A hundred euros!
- That's...

28:13.570 --> 28:16.194
That might be too much.
I don't think...

28:16.362 --> 28:17.777
A thousand euros!

28:21.445 --> 28:23.652
How much money did you bring?

28:23.820 --> 28:26.069
So... A hundred, right?

28:26.778 --> 28:31.652
A hundred and fifty, dude!
Don't try to screw us, cunt!

28:41.737 --> 28:46.152
I'm just a normal, hardworking...

28:46.653 --> 28:48.694
...guy, you know.

28:49.153 --> 28:51.902
My dog means everything to me! Gradje.

28:52.612 --> 28:54.694
Such a sweet dog, dude.

28:55.445 --> 28:57.819
He needs to eat special food.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.652
His intestines are sensitive.

29:01.195 --> 29:06.444
But I got fired, because
I brought my dog with me to work.

29:07.070 --> 29:10.527
But he's sick, you understand?
I can't leave him at home by himself.

29:14.278 --> 29:16.944
That is such a sweet dog, dude.

29:20.903 --> 29:23.652
My god, that is a sweet dog.

29:23.820 --> 29:27.819
And because of the crisis
it's been hard to find a new job.

29:30.862 --> 29:33.861
You could get unemployment benefits.

29:34.028 --> 29:35.986
Dude, they don't give me
enough money.

29:36.153 --> 29:40.152
Me too, dude.
I got fired because of the crisis.

29:40.320 --> 29:45.694
And then I lost my wife and my kids,
because I couldn't take care of them.

29:45.862 --> 29:48.652
And now they don't send us
our checks...

29:48.820 --> 29:51.236
...because Richard asked
for a little bit more money.

29:51.403 --> 29:54.861
Because he needed it to buy
special food for his dog.

29:56.153 --> 29:57.986
That sucks, man.

29:58.278 --> 30:02.361
Richard, Rikkert, Gerrie,
Robbie and Barrie.

30:02.737 --> 30:06.069
Five guys without a job and without
unemployment benefits...

30:06.362 --> 30:08.527
Are they dangerous swindlers...

30:08.695 --> 30:11.861
...or victims of this crisis?
You decide for yourself.

30:12.028 --> 30:15.444
Those asshole cops!
They are not going to give up.

30:15.612 --> 30:18.069
They could come after us.

30:18.445 --> 30:20.736
And then what?
Let them come here.

30:20.903 --> 30:23.819
We will beat them up again,
those homos.

30:23.987 --> 30:26.736
Hit them in the face.

30:36.112 --> 30:38.402
I will clean that up.

31:06.612 --> 31:09.236
Doesn't that look nice?

31:57.153 --> 31:59.027
Richard Batsbak!

31:59.195 --> 32:03.569
If you don't come outside within
five seconds, we will come in.

32:18.653 --> 32:19.986
Dude!

32:27.153 --> 32:29.902
Ten, nine...

32:30.070 --> 32:31.944
...eight, seven...

32:36.528 --> 32:38.694
Goddammit!

32:46.112 --> 32:48.152
Hey, Columbo!

32:48.320 --> 32:51.486
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't have any money!

32:52.278 --> 32:54.694
You can't get anything
from a man who is broke, cunt!

32:54.862 --> 32:56.027
Stupid cunt!

32:56.195 --> 32:58.902
I won't pay for anything anymore!

33:03.445 --> 33:05.111
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

33:05.403 --> 33:08.111
The police didn't make
a strong impression.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.819
Hey, homo.

33:11.487 --> 33:14.652
We won't pay for
anything anymore either.

33:15.945 --> 33:18.069
Hand me four more beers, dude.

33:20.112 --> 33:21.694
Stupid cunt!

33:33.195 --> 33:34.319
What do you want?

33:34.487 --> 33:38.736
We were wondering
if we could...

33:39.403 --> 33:42.069
...shoot a documentary.

34:02.195 --> 34:05.902
It was going well.
But then officer Wanrooy...

34:06.070 --> 34:09.569
I don't want to hear it!
Enough excuses.

34:10.112 --> 34:13.610
Tomorrow a few colleagues from
Den Bosch will come to arrest the boys.

34:13.777 --> 34:16.985
And you will go with them.
You could learn from them.

34:18.070 --> 34:22.777
Are you guys fucking each other?
Homo cops!

34:25.695 --> 34:28.485
Last night was the start of a series
of riots throughout the Brabant region.

34:28.862 --> 34:32.860
Incidents have been reported in Den
Bosch, Eindhoven, Schijndel, Breda...

34:33.027 --> 34:34.735
...and even Budel.

34:38.070 --> 34:43.444
People refuse to be victims of this crisis,
and take matters into their own hands.

34:45.652 --> 34:49.860
Yesterday, this group of guys
from Maaskantje gave the example.

34:56.652 --> 35:00.277
Dad... I love you...

35:02.903 --> 35:05.527
Hey cunt! Look at this.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.652
This is crazy!

35:08.528 --> 35:10.694
What do you mean?

35:10.987 --> 35:13.902
Look at this fucking mess!
It's all broken, cunt!

35:14.403 --> 35:16.736
Take it easy.
Not everything is broken.

35:16.903 --> 35:19.944
Look at this. This is still working.

35:25.403 --> 35:28.444
Goddammit,
you are such a stupid cunt!

35:28.612 --> 35:30.777
You are a real bum!

35:30.987 --> 35:33.944
Stay away from my nuggets, cunt.

35:34.278 --> 35:38.236
Dude, what are you doing?
Goddammit, you are such a stupid cunt!

35:40.028 --> 35:43.527
Barry! I know someone
who can give us money.

35:44.195 --> 35:47.319
Rikkert, I'm taking the car.
I'm going to Den Bosch.

35:48.570 --> 35:50.611
Suck my cock.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.944
We will pay you later.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.944
It's all good, dude.

36:16.862 --> 36:18.194
Take care!

36:43.070 --> 36:45.652
I want it back in two days,
plus 20 percent.

36:46.070 --> 36:50.152
Of course, dude.
In two days you will get it back.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.902
My promise to you. I swear.

36:57.445 --> 37:01.444
Me and my buddies will guarantee it.
You don't have to worry.

37:12.653 --> 37:14.902
It's going to be all right.

37:15.070 --> 37:16.944
Go Peter!

37:17.487 --> 37:19.194
You're number one!

37:23.195 --> 37:24.236
Take care!

37:28.820 --> 37:30.319
Goddammit!

37:30.487 --> 37:32.694
Rikkert, your car!

37:33.528 --> 37:36.319
It won't work, dude.
Look at that lock.

37:36.487 --> 37:38.111
I got the strongest U-lock.

37:43.278 --> 37:45.777
My car rim! Hey, cunt!

37:46.653 --> 37:48.486
That's a good U-lock,
goddammit.

37:54.028 --> 37:55.527
Hey!

37:59.112 --> 38:01.527
No!

38:01.695 --> 38:05.152
That's my Opel Manta!

38:06.570 --> 38:07.777
Cunt!

38:17.195 --> 38:20.027
- What do you want?
- It's Gerrie. come to Den Bosch.

38:20.237 --> 38:23.152
Come to the Rompert Casino.
I found a solution to our problems.

38:24.028 --> 38:27.111
Due to the delinquent
status on your account...

38:27.278 --> 38:30.236
...your phone service
has been suspended.

38:33.237 --> 38:35.944
We have to go somewhere.
You can wait inside.

38:36.987 --> 38:39.486
And you better
not steal anything, dude.

38:43.862 --> 38:47.736
Gerrie has a plan.
I'm curious to see what that is.

38:47.903 --> 38:52.152
I lost my job, my girl
and my ride, goddammit!

38:53.028 --> 38:56.902
How come Barrie and Gerrie
didn't take the scooter?

38:58.153 --> 38:59.236
What?

39:19.945 --> 39:21.361
I guess we have to walk.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.236
Goddammit!

39:47.028 --> 39:48.236
Sorry.

39:48.820 --> 39:52.027
I took a shit in my jail cell,
there's shit everywhere!

40:11.278 --> 40:13.944
Where did you get
all this money, dude?

40:14.612 --> 40:16.027
No more bets.

40:16.278 --> 40:19.694
Hey, cunt! Tell me where
you got all this money!

40:19.862 --> 40:21.486
Pay attention.

40:27.362 --> 40:30.736
Where did you get the money?

40:33.403 --> 40:35.319
Red 23, congratulations.

40:41.987 --> 40:45.777
Goddammit! What are the odds?

40:46.445 --> 40:49.444
Gerrie is the man!

40:49.695 --> 40:51.569
But he looks like an ass.

40:53.362 --> 40:55.361
Black 11. Too bad.

41:03.945 --> 41:05.527
Goddammit!

41:05.695 --> 41:07.444
What a homo.

41:10.695 --> 41:12.486
I don't get it, man.

41:12.820 --> 41:15.027
This wasn't suppose to happen.

41:15.195 --> 41:17.444
You are such a mongoloid.

41:18.820 --> 41:21.694
This tastes good, dude. Coconut.

41:23.237 --> 41:25.152
Don't worry, dude.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.736
That guy lives all the way
in Den Bosch.

41:27.903 --> 41:30.486
He won't come down to Maaskantje.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.486
I don't have a job.

41:37.903 --> 41:39.777
I lost my Opel Manta.

41:39.945 --> 41:41.694
I lost Manuela.

41:41.862 --> 41:44.444
She has a new boyfriend. Homo.

41:48.070 --> 41:50.402
All I wanted was to fuck.

41:50.570 --> 41:53.236
Just fuck, you know. Fuck.

41:53.987 --> 41:56.736
That new guy probably
fucked her already.

41:56.903 --> 42:00.152
What about me?
No, she won't fuck me.

42:00.778 --> 42:04.902
Why can't I ever have sex?

42:05.070 --> 42:07.152
For once.

42:09.695 --> 42:12.444
Are you a virgin or something?

42:14.028 --> 42:15.277
No.

42:16.528 --> 42:18.611
He is still a virgin.

42:18.778 --> 42:20.736
Hey, homo!

42:21.695 --> 42:23.819
Homo!

42:33.153 --> 42:34.236
Police - Confiscated

42:34.403 --> 42:37.777
Goddammit!
Who do they think they are?

42:38.112 --> 42:40.694
They moved quickly.

42:49.195 --> 42:52.152
I'm going to see Manuela.
And fuck her.

42:54.237 --> 42:56.902
Sure, dude.

42:57.070 --> 42:59.111
Go and do that.

42:59.445 --> 43:03.152
Make sure you get
the right hole. Virgin!

43:29.820 --> 43:33.027
You have such a nice pussy.

43:38.362 --> 43:42.444
I can't wait to come inside you.
Fill you up with semen.

43:42.612 --> 43:44.986
You are such a hot chick.

43:48.737 --> 43:51.444
Take care. See you tonight.

43:57.070 --> 43:58.111
Hey, cunt!

44:01.237 --> 44:06.152
...I slapped her face with my
hard cock. Like this.

44:07.195 --> 44:08.444
She was laughing, dude.

44:14.903 --> 44:17.069
Truck driver!

44:17.737 --> 44:19.069
Honk, honk.

44:42.987 --> 44:45.319
There is shit on the wall.

44:47.028 --> 44:48.986
He didn't eat the right food.

44:53.862 --> 44:55.444
Isn't that sad?

44:57.570 --> 45:01.736
You want to drink something, Gradje?
You'll like that.

45:08.528 --> 45:12.694
They cut off the water too?

45:13.070 --> 45:14.194
Cunts!

45:18.528 --> 45:21.694
Ground forces ready?
The warning shot means go.

45:24.320 --> 45:27.944
What are you doing
with that bone, dude?

45:28.153 --> 45:30.319
It tastes all right. A bit salty.

45:30.487 --> 45:32.986
That's Gradje's bone, cunt!

45:33.487 --> 45:36.861
Do you know how hard life is
for that dog?

45:54.862 --> 45:56.319
They're shooting on us.

46:12.945 --> 46:14.902
Reinout Oerlemans - Producer

46:15.070 --> 46:18.236
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have some bad news.

46:18.403 --> 46:22.152
We are out of money. We have
spent all the money in the budget.

46:22.320 --> 46:25.569
I apologize. We have to cancel
the production.

46:25.737 --> 46:31.152
We've tried everything to get more
money, but it didn't work out.

46:31.528 --> 46:35.944
But to ensure that you won't leave
the theater feeling frustrated...

46:36.112 --> 46:39.986
...we have decided that the boys
will tell you the rest of the story...

46:40.153 --> 46:44.111
...so at least you know
how good the ending...

46:44.278 --> 46:47.361
...would have been.
So boys, come over here.

46:47.695 --> 46:50.736
There's the camera.

46:52.237 --> 46:54.569
Good luck!

46:56.070 --> 46:57.986
Goddammit.

47:05.612 --> 47:08.819
Do I have to tell
the whole fucking story?

47:10.945 --> 47:12.944
Gerrie, you tell them.

47:15.903 --> 47:17.777
I don't think so, dude.

47:21.570 --> 47:23.527
So...

47:24.278 --> 47:26.319
The coppers were shooting at us!

47:26.487 --> 47:28.569
- Coppers!
- Yes, coppers!

47:28.737 --> 47:32.861
So we were running from them
and shook them off. Homos!

47:33.028 --> 47:37.236
So we got to the grocery store. We saw
Rikkert's girl, she was closing the store.

47:37.403 --> 47:41.569
She was standing there with
her naked pussy. A big one, dude!

47:41.737 --> 47:45.736
Don't talk shit about Manuela.
What do you mean 'naked pussy'?

47:46.903 --> 47:49.152
- I just thought she was naked.
- No, she wasn't.

47:51.320 --> 47:55.402
So we hid there.
We thought the dog was dead.

47:55.570 --> 47:58.819
Richard went home,
and found him still alive!

47:58.987 --> 48:01.777
He just wouldn't die.
A true die-hard!

48:15.195 --> 48:18.527
Such a sweet dog, dude.

48:19.403 --> 48:22.611
You gave him a funeral, right?

48:22.778 --> 48:25.986
A real ceremony, right?

48:46.987 --> 48:49.986
So we were at the store.

48:50.153 --> 48:54.402
Rikkert and Manuela were there,
she was naked again.

48:54.570 --> 48:56.027
Dude!

48:56.403 --> 49:00.152
What, dude?
So Rikkert fucked her like this.

49:08.570 --> 49:09.944
Hey!

49:10.487 --> 49:14.027
Virgin. Fuck!

49:16.778 --> 49:20.486
Hey, did you fuck her or not?

49:20.653 --> 49:21.777
Yes.

49:21.945 --> 49:22.986
Virgin!

49:23.153 --> 49:27.486
So she started whining of course.
Such a slut. She's been around.

49:38.903 --> 49:41.152
What I meant was...

49:41.320 --> 49:45.277
...that she should have looked
after her two kids.

49:51.403 --> 49:53.444
Do you boys like sausages?

49:56.153 --> 50:00.777
The next day I went outside,
and guess who I ran into, dude.

50:00.945 --> 50:04.902
Peter Aerts! Such a homo.

50:05.070 --> 50:07.069
He asked where his money was.

50:07.237 --> 50:09.569
What, dude? Where is my money, dude?

50:39.237 --> 50:40.819
Wham, wham!

50:44.070 --> 50:48.319
That's bullshit, dude.
You were dreaming, homo!

50:48.737 --> 50:52.819
What were you thinking, borrowing
money from The Lumberjack?

50:53.653 --> 50:57.486
Dude, I came up with a great plan.

50:59.737 --> 51:01.569
To kidnap Jody Bernal!

51:14.612 --> 51:16.194
What a homo, dude.

51:16.362 --> 51:21.527
We had him perform anyway,
so we could steal the ticket money.

51:22.195 --> 51:26.819
The show was in Schotsveld, you know?
I fingered Ilona van Zoggel there.

51:26.987 --> 51:30.736
We ran inside. The coppers were
behind us. The place was packed.

51:30.903 --> 51:33.444
But they started shooting.

51:38.570 --> 51:41.361
They missed me!
Cross-eyed coppers!

51:41.528 --> 51:45.152
So we ran outside.
We stole a car from this couple.

51:45.320 --> 51:47.277
Rikkert got in and sat
on their baby.

51:51.112 --> 51:52.652
Sorry.

52:00.528 --> 52:05.861
What a stupid ass cop!
He ruined the van, killed a family...

52:06.028 --> 52:09.402
...and lost his job.

52:10.737 --> 52:12.069
You can stay home.

52:20.320 --> 52:22.861
We were driving like crazy...

52:29.278 --> 52:33.111
So we were driving.
We lost the coppers.

52:35.778 --> 52:37.569
We shook them off.

52:43.695 --> 52:45.694
It is him again.

52:48.112 --> 52:52.027
I just found this in my desk.
Now get back to work! Peter?

52:53.903 --> 52:56.194
That's a nice leather jacket!

53:01.987 --> 53:03.652
Peter Kelder.

53:14.653 --> 53:16.569
So we are back on.

53:24.778 --> 53:26.527
We lost the cops!

53:36.403 --> 53:40.152
Do you hate paying your taxes
as much as I do?

53:43.820 --> 53:45.319
Take care! I'm out!

53:45.487 --> 53:50.111
That was the hit show 'My name is Ronnie'.
We continue with our news headlines.

53:50.278 --> 53:52.527
Since the start of riots in the South...

53:52.695 --> 53:56.444
...there have been outbreaks
of violence in other regions.

53:56.612 --> 54:00.569
Incidents have been reported in the
regions of Utrecht, Zuid-Holland...

54:00.737 --> 54:02.486
...Gelderland and Overijssel.

54:02.653 --> 54:06.819
It started with five guys from Maaskantje
who refuse to pay for anything anymore.

54:06.987 --> 54:10.361
Here are Berry and Daniel
with the weather forecast.

55:03.737 --> 55:05.944
The car is trashed!

55:06.528 --> 55:07.944
Piece of shit.

55:09.695 --> 55:11.069
Where is Gerrie?

55:11.237 --> 55:14.194
He should stay far away from me.

55:53.695 --> 55:55.402
Guys...

55:55.987 --> 55:59.444
We should keep moving. I'm ready.

56:01.278 --> 56:02.402
Where are we going?

56:05.445 --> 56:07.777
Ministry of Defence The Hague

56:07.987 --> 56:12.277
Leave me alone, you fucking cop!
I won't pay for anything.

56:13.737 --> 56:15.527
What city is this?

56:16.487 --> 56:19.444
It's actually happening throughout
the whole region of Brabant.

56:22.778 --> 56:25.152
Who are responsible?

56:25.737 --> 56:29.652
A few guys from Maaskant...

56:29.820 --> 56:31.069
Maaskantje.

56:31.528 --> 56:33.777
- From where?
- Maaskantje.

56:34.153 --> 56:35.361
Never heard of it.

56:35.528 --> 56:40.736
I didn't know it either. Apparently
it's south of Den Bosch.

56:40.903 --> 56:43.736
I'm not paying. Bonfire!

56:46.445 --> 56:47.736
Maaskant, right?

56:48.153 --> 56:50.819
And why haven't they been arrested?

56:51.195 --> 56:56.944
Maaskan-tje. We're not sure why.
We're unclear on the situation.

56:57.528 --> 57:01.736
Anyway, the cops haven't
been able to arrest them.

57:01.903 --> 57:04.569
I will throw a rock!

57:08.945 --> 57:13.111
So if we get rid those guys from Maaskant,
everything will go back to normal?

57:16.237 --> 57:17.402
I would think so.

57:19.362 --> 57:21.611
Just bomb the place.

57:24.737 --> 57:26.527
Who would remember Maaskant?

57:26.695 --> 57:29.069
- Maaskantje.
- Right.

57:29.237 --> 57:31.527
I had never heard of it.

57:31.695 --> 57:33.194
I didn't know it either.

57:33.445 --> 57:34.944
So we agree on that.

57:37.070 --> 57:38.444
That is all?

57:43.278 --> 57:44.444
Yes.

57:47.320 --> 57:48.819
Oh, no.

57:48.987 --> 57:53.111
I heard that there is still
someone out there...

57:53.278 --> 57:55.819
...a cameraman.

57:56.195 --> 57:58.736
But that won't be a problem.

58:00.070 --> 58:01.986
Gerrie, that cunt!

58:02.153 --> 58:05.819
He's acting like a child. Such a homo.

58:07.903 --> 58:09.486
I'm hungry.

58:21.820 --> 58:24.527
That was big ass ball of fire!

58:24.695 --> 58:25.986
Bam!

58:26.987 --> 58:29.944
It hit Schijndel, cunt!

58:34.612 --> 58:38.527
Have you ever heard of a town
called Schijndel?

58:40.403 --> 58:41.527
Good.

58:42.612 --> 58:44.069
Another one?

58:44.237 --> 58:46.486
That is possible.

58:46.653 --> 58:49.277
But it will take eight hours.

58:49.445 --> 58:53.611
Just send our best guys, and take
them out. How many are there?

58:58.945 --> 59:00.069
Five.

59:00.445 --> 59:03.361
We will send fifty. That will bring
an end to this nonsense, right?

59:03.528 --> 59:05.736
- Yes, I would think so.
- Good.

59:17.362 --> 59:18.694
No!

59:18.862 --> 59:20.944
Barrie!

59:41.195 --> 59:43.152
That wasn't too bad.

59:43.570 --> 59:44.652
Where did it go?

59:51.362 --> 59:54.027
Look at this! Look at this!

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.819
- This is the real deal.
- Yes.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.777
Can I see it?

01:00:17.487 --> 01:00:19.777
You deserved that, cunt!

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.361
Where did you get this?

01:00:36.362 --> 01:00:40.569
We don't know why the town
of Schijndel...

01:00:40.987 --> 01:00:43.861
...was attacked.

01:00:44.028 --> 01:00:49.444
We suspect a technical
error in Belgium...

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:53.277
...accidently activated a Scud missile.

01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:54.902
Scud missile...

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.236
Scunt.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.694
This wasn't a human error,
but a technical error.

01:00:59.862 --> 01:01:03.902
Goddammit, this fucking camera! I'm
going to the van, I'll be right back.

01:01:04.112 --> 01:01:07.236
Even though many people died,
there is no reason for a panic.

01:01:07.403 --> 01:01:11.319
We have declared a state of emergency,
and have sent paramedics...

01:01:11.695 --> 01:01:14.069
From World War ll.

01:01:14.403 --> 01:01:16.111
But they still work!

01:01:21.195 --> 01:01:22.611
Hey, virgin!

01:01:22.778 --> 01:01:25.319
Forget that girl, dude.

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:37.694
Rene, are you with me?

01:02:03.403 --> 01:02:05.777
Are The Netherlands and Belgium at war?

01:02:07.612 --> 01:02:10.861
No, absolutely not.

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:14.861
What I've been trying to explain,
is that it was an accident.

01:02:19.695 --> 01:02:24.069
Behind me you see the remains
of what used to be Schijndel.

01:02:24.528 --> 01:02:29.111
I've heard from reliable sources, that
this was not caused by a technical error...

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:34.277
...but a failed attack on Maaskantje
ordered by the Dutch government...

01:02:35.528 --> 01:02:39.152
...to kill five guys.

01:02:39.403 --> 01:02:42.277
I would like to warn the people
in Maaskantje.

01:02:42.445 --> 01:02:45.694
Leave with your families.
It's not safe here.

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:48.819
Craziness! Man!

01:02:49.278 --> 01:02:52.736
This is Peter Vernhout reporting
live from Maaskantje.

01:02:52.903 --> 01:02:55.569
Take care and good luck!

01:02:56.112 --> 01:03:01.361
Goddammit!
They want to destroy our town?

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:02.986
I don't think so!

01:03:03.528 --> 01:03:06.069
Nobody touches Maaskantje!

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.277
Can we borrow that?

01:03:11.237 --> 01:03:12.694
Sure.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.652
I have some more in the barn.

01:03:27.778 --> 01:03:30.527
You can each pick one.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:47.444
Those were the good old days, the war.

01:03:47.987 --> 01:03:52.027
This place was packed
with Jews in 1942.

01:03:53.153 --> 01:03:57.777
You would hand them over to the Nazis
and they would give you anything.

01:03:58.445 --> 01:04:00.277
That was a good deal.

01:04:00.445 --> 01:04:05.361
Goebbels gave me this jacket.

01:04:05.528 --> 01:04:09.152
Personally! He was a nice guy.

01:04:31.195 --> 01:04:32.694
More weapons!

01:04:32.862 --> 01:04:33.902
Yes!

01:04:52.528 --> 01:04:55.777
Nicky, Danny, come here!

01:04:56.987 --> 01:05:00.069
Nicky, Danny! You'll be in trouble!

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:08.319
Nicky, Danny!

01:05:44.362 --> 01:05:46.361
Hey, cunt!

01:06:00.778 --> 01:06:02.402
Nicky?

01:06:03.237 --> 01:06:04.986
Danny?

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.652
Nicky?

01:06:37.237 --> 01:06:38.527
Thank you.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:40.902
No problem.

01:06:47.778 --> 01:06:50.069
Goddammit. Such a long drive.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.694
Keep your hands off my croquettes.

01:07:17.862 --> 01:07:19.361
Get out!

01:07:21.528 --> 01:07:24.569
Can Manuela and the kids
stay here for a while?

01:07:27.362 --> 01:07:28.777
All right. Fine.

01:07:33.237 --> 01:07:35.236
So I take it you're not leaving?

01:07:35.445 --> 01:07:39.361
No, dude. This food joint is my life.
I won't let anybody take it away.

01:07:41.487 --> 01:07:44.236
Then I guess you could use this.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.152
I am here to help you.

01:08:18.653 --> 01:08:20.361
Craziness!

01:08:45.278 --> 01:08:49.277
Get closer! Just aim straight, cunt!

01:09:07.778 --> 01:09:10.361
You did good, cunt!

01:09:27.944 --> 01:09:31.361
Hey, you fucking cop!
Let me out, you homo!

01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:42.111
Goddammit, too much recoil!

01:09:55.528 --> 01:09:58.027
One, two, three...

01:10:26.528 --> 01:10:29.027
Manuela!
What are you doing here?

01:10:29.195 --> 01:10:30.861
I got bored.

01:10:35.528 --> 01:10:37.944
So you promise that you will help me?

01:10:38.112 --> 01:10:40.236
And don't act weird, okay?

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.111
Are you sure?

01:11:20.612 --> 01:11:21.902
Gerrie!

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:23.986
You saved my life!

01:11:24.987 --> 01:11:28.986
I am so proud of you. I couldn't
have asked for a better son.

01:11:34.695 --> 01:11:37.611
- What are you talking about?
- Gerrie...

01:11:38.737 --> 01:11:40.736
I am your father.

01:11:43.487 --> 01:11:45.194
That is my jacket.

01:11:46.695 --> 01:11:50.611
When you were little,
I left you with your mother.

01:11:50.987 --> 01:11:55.486
I was way too young, and I could tell
that you were going to be a loser.

01:11:55.653 --> 01:11:57.944
And my food joint was far more
important to me.

01:11:58.112 --> 01:12:01.694
I was embarrassed to have
such an ugly child. But...

01:12:02.112 --> 01:12:03.986
...you saved my life.

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:08.694
I'm so proud of your ugly ass. I want
everyone to know that I'm your dad.

01:12:10.028 --> 01:12:11.236
Dad...

01:12:11.862 --> 01:12:13.152
Son...

01:12:35.862 --> 01:12:37.402
Do you want to have a turn?

01:12:38.028 --> 01:12:39.236
Sure.

01:13:11.612 --> 01:13:13.194
Cover-up?

01:13:34.195 --> 01:13:36.277
Richard! Richard!

01:13:49.028 --> 01:13:51.944
This one is for Gradje, cunt!

01:13:54.987 --> 01:13:56.444
Goddammit!

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:26.986
Drop your weapons!
Or I will shoot your friend.

01:14:27.153 --> 01:14:29.152
You too, mustache!

01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:00.194
Truck driver!

01:15:17.653 --> 01:15:19.819
Nobody touches Maaskantje!

01:15:22.903 --> 01:15:24.111
Bang!

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:31.069
Fucking mongoloid!

01:15:35.612 --> 01:15:36.902
Hey, cop!

01:15:37.153 --> 01:15:40.777
You did that with your foot?
Cool!

01:16:00.445 --> 01:16:01.777
Dude, where's Rikkert?

01:16:19.278 --> 01:16:21.694
What about my boyfriend?

01:16:21.862 --> 01:16:23.402
He is dead.

01:16:25.987 --> 01:16:27.027
Okay.

01:16:39.445 --> 01:16:41.236
Nice tribal.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.111
Rikkert is no longer a virgin!

01:17:23.778 --> 01:17:25.902
I will have to put you under arrest.

01:17:26.945 --> 01:17:27.986
What?

01:17:28.153 --> 01:17:29.444
Well...

01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:32.319
Unpaid fines and stuff...

01:17:34.362 --> 01:17:36.361
What do you think?

01:17:36.945 --> 01:17:38.486
Please?

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:49.069
R. Batsbak, G. Van Boven...

01:17:49.237 --> 01:17:53.152
...R. Biemans, B. Butsers
and R. Schuurmans...

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.652
...the defendants...

01:17:55.112 --> 01:18:00.444
...are found guilty of the following:

01:18:01.528 --> 01:18:07.736
Destroying private property,
disturbance of the public peace...

01:18:07.903 --> 01:18:09.861
...public intoxication...

01:18:10.362 --> 01:18:14.194
...drug possession...

01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:17.527
...disrespecting an officer on duty...

01:18:17.695 --> 01:18:21.902
...disrespecting an officer off duty,
indecent exposure...

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:26.861
...robbery, third degree assault...

01:18:27.153 --> 01:18:30.402
...speeding...

01:18:30.862 --> 01:18:34.236
...kidnapping,
destroying City property...

01:18:34.403 --> 01:18:38.027

...polluting the environment...

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:43.861
...unpaid parking tickets...

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:46.444
...withholding evidence...

01:18:46.862 --> 01:18:52.861
...and 39 charges of
voluntary manslaughter.

01:18:54.903 --> 01:18:58.111
The court of Den Bosch...

01:18:58.278 --> 01:19:00.819
...sentences each one of you...

01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:03.736
...to 240 hours of public service.

01:19:18.737 --> 01:19:22.027
Brabant is quiet and peaceful again...

01:19:22.195 --> 01:19:26.736
...after the instigators
got their sentences.

01:19:26.903 --> 01:19:32.527
People have gone back to their lives,
and are coping with the damage.

01:19:32.695 --> 01:19:35.527
Other news. Our defence minister
has not been found yet.

01:19:36.445 --> 01:19:37.569
Do you remember me?

01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:42.277
Stupid cunt!
You owe me money!

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:45.319
Shut your mouth, cunt!

01:19:46.112 --> 01:19:49.694
I will break your neck, dude!
Try to stop me!

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:53.527
Try to stop me!

01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.944
DJ Paul Elstak!

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:37.150
Subrip: easytobeaman

01:20:40.028 --> 01:20:43.277
Don't talk about my dog like that.

01:20:43.528 --> 01:20:44.777
Movie theater homos!

01:20:53.487 --> 01:20:55.652
So you you believe... Let's start over.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:58.361
Let me out of here,
homo!

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:01.861
Hey! Are you fucking or something?

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.777
She's been around.

01:21:16.945 --> 01:21:18.402
I don't feel anything.

01:21:27.112 --> 01:21:28.861
...fucking whore.

01:21:31.237 --> 01:21:34.319
Dammit! You ruined...

01:21:38.528 --> 01:21:39.569
It broke.

01:21:55.153 --> 01:21:57.486
Paul, dude. Add some turbo, man.

01:22:19.653 --> 01:22:23.652
No! My Opel Manta!

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.861
Fuck, that was to the camera.

01:22:39.945 --> 01:22:42.277
Hit her head, her cheek.

01:22:42.445 --> 01:22:45.236
Sperm splashes through the air.

01:22:46.487 --> 01:22:49.569
Use the fingers. Like a rabbit,

01:22:49.737 --> 01:22:51.694
pussy and anus.

01:22:51.903 --> 01:22:54.152
His mom's a whore.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.277
I hit him in the neck.

01:22:56.445 --> 01:22:59.652
Don't touch my cake, dude.

01:23:15.237 --> 01:23:17.902
Look! I just found this in my desk...

01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:19.111
Let's do that again.

01:23:20.737 --> 01:23:23.236
I just found this. In my desk. So...

01:23:23.403 --> 01:23:24.444
Fuck!

01:23:24.612 --> 01:23:27.777
I just found this. In my desk.

01:23:29.487 --> 01:23:30.527
No, fuck.

01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:05.736
That got trashed.

01:24:11.278 --> 01:24:13.736
The court...

01:24:13.945 --> 01:24:16.569
...of Den Bosch...

01:24:17.403 --> 01:24:19.611
...will revoke your...

01:24:19.778 --> 01:24:22.111
...driving license.

01:24:23.028 --> 01:24:25.652
Truck driver. Honk, honk.
