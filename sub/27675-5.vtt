Yep, it's that one.

25:24.845 --> 25:26.205
[whispers] Steal something.

25:29.125 --> 25:30.365
-No.
-Yeah.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.125
-No. Why would I steal?
-Yeah.

25:32.205 --> 25:33.565
-Because I dare you.
-So?

25:33.645 --> 25:35.365
-I dare you to do it.
-Wh--

25:35.445 --> 25:37.445
-I dare you. Come on, it's easy.
-Don't. I can't...

25:37.525 --> 25:38.725
-Just live a little.
-I'm not--

25:38.805 --> 25:40.045
Shh. It's fine.

25:42.685 --> 25:44.205
[bell jangles]

25:48.125 --> 25:49.485
[door closes; bell jingles]

26:00.045 --> 26:01.005
Whoo.

26:08.205 --> 26:10.725
You were a man. Now you're not.

26:11.925 --> 26:13.445
Yeah, his shift is over.

26:13.525 --> 26:14.525
-Hi...
-Hi.

26:14.605 --> 26:15.885
Otis.

26:16.765 --> 26:18.165
I'm supposed to be Hedwig.

26:18.245 --> 26:20.045
Oh. I love that film.

26:22.685 --> 26:23.525
[beep]

26:28.605 --> 26:30.405
-You all right?
-Hmm.

26:30.485 --> 26:32.045
I'm all good. I'm just casual.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.885
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

26:35.965 --> 26:37.765
You just seem a bit nervous.

26:37.845 --> 26:41.445
Hmm? Why-Why would I be nervous?
I'm not--

26:44.005 --> 26:45.645
Were you intending to pay for that?

26:46.645 --> 26:48.685
-Yeah.
-You weren't, were you?

26:48.765 --> 26:52.645
I don't know why I did that. I--
I've never done anything like that before.

26:52.725 --> 26:55.805
Yeah, I can tell. You're an awful thief.

26:55.885 --> 26:58.005
How much is it? Is it, like, 50p?

26:58.085 --> 26:59.725
I'm obligated to call the police.

27:01.765 --> 27:04.205
-Don't. Please.
-Yes, Otis.

27:07.325 --> 27:09.405
Ha ha ha ha ha.

27:09.485 --> 27:10.485
I'm joking.

27:11.405 --> 27:12.405
[sighs]

27:12.485 --> 27:14.085
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:14.765 --> 27:15.765
It's on me.

27:17.405 --> 27:18.405
Okay.

27:19.485 --> 27:21.645
-Heh. Thank you.
-It's okay.

27:22.565 --> 27:23.765
-Heh heh.
-Thank you.

27:23.845 --> 27:24.965
You're welcome.

27:25.845 --> 27:26.965
[bell jingles]

27:29.845 --> 27:31.405
I got caught.

27:31.485 --> 27:32.725
Of course you did.

27:41.365 --> 27:42.765
I get sent images all the time.

27:43.645 --> 27:45.845
You know, tits...

27:46.685 --> 27:49.365
minges... the occasional butthole.

27:49.445 --> 27:52.645
Kyle, the vagina. The one sent out
this morning. Did you send it?

27:52.725 --> 27:55.925
No. I keep all the pictures
for my own personal collection.

27:57.045 --> 27:59.645
I'm more of a connoisseur
of amateur erotica.

27:59.725 --> 28:01.005
Kyle, that's disgusting.

28:02.285 --> 28:03.525
Yeah, I know.

28:05.405 --> 28:06.605
Okay. Get lost now.

28:08.365 --> 28:10.125
-Go on.
-Unh.

28:11.605 --> 28:12.925
-Go on.
-Come on.

28:14.525 --> 28:15.885
[sighs]

28:15.965 --> 28:17.725
-[door closes]
-Well, was it him?

28:18.445 --> 28:19.365
I don't think so.

28:19.445 --> 28:22.365
Well, we're running out of time.
You're really shit at helping.

28:22.445 --> 28:24.725
-She's just doing you a favor.
-Ah.

28:26.285 --> 28:27.285
What's going on?

28:27.365 --> 28:30.765
-My life is over.
-Why? Rubes, what's wrong?

28:32.965 --> 28:35.325
That minge
everyone's been laughing at all day--

28:36.165 --> 28:39.165
it's mine, and I'm fucked.

28:39.245 --> 28:40.565
I'm totally fucked.

28:43.325 --> 28:44.805
[sighs]

28:44.885 --> 28:46.165
[whispers] Go and sit.

28:50.325 --> 28:52.005
Ruby, um...

28:53.085 --> 28:55.085
Okay, look, worst-case scenario--

28:55.165 --> 28:57.965
photo goes out,
everyone in school knows it's you,

28:58.045 --> 29:00.285
and you could be humiliated.

29:00.365 --> 29:03.365
-You're not making me feel better.
-But only if you let yourself be.

29:04.405 --> 29:07.965
Everyone has bodies, right.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

29:09.605 --> 29:11.605
I have a-- I have a funky-looking toe.

29:11.685 --> 29:14.125
-Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Otis, don't.
-And I--

29:16.365 --> 29:17.725
-It looks like a thumb.
-Yuck.

29:17.805 --> 29:20.085
Anyway, point is, whoever did this

29:20.165 --> 29:23.125
is intending to shame you,
but it won't work if you don't let them.

29:23.205 --> 29:26.165
If they want to shame me, why haven't they
revealed who I am already?

29:26.245 --> 29:28.685
-This is torture.
-Oh, my God.

29:30.245 --> 29:31.245
It's a girl.

29:32.565 --> 29:34.165
We thought it was a boy. It's a girl.

29:34.245 --> 29:37.565
Emotional blackmail, demanding an apology.
This is some girl shit.

29:38.165 --> 29:39.165
What girls hate you, Ruby?

29:39.245 --> 29:42.645
All of them. I'm a bitch, Maeve.
I'm a bitch to everyone.

29:42.725 --> 29:44.765
-Yeah.
-I need to go home now.

29:44.845 --> 29:46.045
Olivia, can you call me a taxi?

29:46.125 --> 29:48.365
-Use my phone.
-Mm-hmm.

29:48.445 --> 29:49.685
[sighs]

29:50.605 --> 29:52.285
[typing]

29:54.805 --> 29:57.525
Who else knows your passcode, Ruby?

29:57.605 --> 29:59.085
No one. Just Liv.

30:08.925 --> 30:10.365
You?

30:10.445 --> 30:12.445
[music playing]

30:15.165 --> 30:16.525
Are you a bodybuilder?

30:19.685 --> 30:20.805
Ahem.

30:23.085 --> 30:25.805
Sorry, I get a bit lost in math sometimes.
Were you speaking?

30:25.885 --> 30:28.485
Are you some kind of bodybuilder?

30:28.565 --> 30:30.485
Your arms are, like, really big.

30:30.565 --> 30:33.405
Oh, thanks.
Yeah. I love working out.

30:34.205 --> 30:37.805
I'd like to compete one day, but, um,
I have underdeveloped calf muscles.

30:39.245 --> 30:40.245
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:40.525 --> 30:42.805
Nah, it's okay. I also love maths.

30:42.885 --> 30:44.645
So, I have options.

30:44.725 --> 30:46.165
What about you?

30:48.245 --> 30:52.005
Uh... I don't really know
what I wanna do when I leave school.

30:52.085 --> 30:54.685
-Mm.
-I always know when I have a spot coming.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.685
So maybe I'll become a facialist.

31:01.845 --> 31:05.085
-How's the trigonometry?
-Yeah, it's super-hard.

31:05.725 --> 31:09.925
But so is algebra. I'll probably have to
choose one or the other next year.

31:10.005 --> 31:11.245
It's a really tough choice.

31:12.125 --> 31:13.605
Have you ever tried a mind map?

31:14.725 --> 31:16.165
I love mind maps.

31:17.965 --> 31:19.045
[whimpers]

31:28.965 --> 31:30.045
[man] Here, I'll do it.

31:30.125 --> 31:31.445
Where you goin'?

31:32.245 --> 31:33.645
[second man] Excuse me, miss.

31:35.245 --> 31:37.765
-Want a lift?
-Um, no, thank you.

31:40.405 --> 31:41.525
[man] Look at him.

31:43.285 --> 31:45.125
Have you got a penis, Miss?

31:45.205 --> 31:46.365
[laughter]

31:46.445 --> 31:48.085
Go on, show us your dick.

31:48.165 --> 31:49.725
Just leave me alone, please.

31:51.685 --> 31:52.925
[man] You gay fuck.

31:56.085 --> 31:58.685
Please, please. This-This isn't me.
It's-It's a costume.

31:58.765 --> 32:00.805
I was going to see a film with a friend.
I'm not a--

32:02.205 --> 32:03.365
[man laughs]

32:03.445 --> 32:04.965
Yeah, fuck 'im.

32:07.245 --> 32:08.645
I wasn't gonna send it to anyone.

32:08.725 --> 32:11.685
-I just wanted her to know how it feels.
-What are you talking about?

32:12.605 --> 32:16.645
[sighs] You say mean shit to me
every day, Ruby.

32:16.725 --> 32:19.605
"Your bag's fake. Your mascara's clumpy.

32:19.685 --> 32:22.165
You'll never have the right body type
to get a proper thigh gap."

32:22.245 --> 32:24.165
You don't, Olivia. It's a fact.

32:24.245 --> 32:25.405
See? She's horrible.

32:25.485 --> 32:29.765
I think what Olivia is saying
is she feels overly criticized by you,

32:29.845 --> 32:32.205
which is still not an excuse
to blackmail someone.

32:32.285 --> 32:34.845
I only did it so she can feel what I feel
just for one day.

32:34.925 --> 32:37.645
I don't say what's wrong with you
to make you feel bad.

32:37.725 --> 32:39.605
I do it to be helpful.

32:39.685 --> 32:42.005
Maybe Olivia wants a friend
that supports her.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.885
But we say nasty stuff about everyone.

32:43.965 --> 32:47.925
Yes, but you have to accept
the imperfect parts of people, too.

32:48.005 --> 32:50.285
How do you guys trust each other, if not?

32:54.125 --> 32:55.885
I'm really sorry, Ruby.

32:59.085 --> 33:01.525
I hate you. I'm going home.

33:04.845 --> 33:07.525
-[door opens]
-Fine. She's such a bitch.

33:10.005 --> 33:11.245
[door slams]

33:12.485 --> 33:14.365
Hmm. Heh.

33:17.365 --> 33:18.965
How'd you know it was a girl?

33:20.325 --> 33:21.565
I read a lot of true crime.

33:25.085 --> 33:26.885
[disco music playing]

33:37.085 --> 33:39.125
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

33:45.445 --> 33:48.005
-Are you all right, mate? You're bleeding.
-Yeah.

33:48.085 --> 33:49.925
-Here, sit down.
-Yeah, I'm okay. Um...

33:50.685 --> 33:52.965
-I'm okay. Heh heh.  I'm okay.
-Sit down.

33:53.045 --> 33:54.645
-Anyone got a tissue?
-[woman] Yeah.

33:56.605 --> 33:59.245
-Yeah, no, I'm okay. I'm okay.
-Here you go, babes. You sure?

33:59.325 --> 34:02.365
Yeah. Uh, I just-I just need to use
somebody's phone.

34:02.445 --> 34:05.205
I've-I've had all my stuff stolen,
and I just need to go home.

34:06.125 --> 34:07.965
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Oh. Here you go, mate.

34:08.245 --> 34:10.845
Thanks. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm good.

34:10.925 --> 34:12.925
[dials number]

34:15.245 --> 34:17.245
[telephone ringing]

34:19.925 --> 34:21.725
[sobs] Hi.

34:21.845 --> 34:25.925
Hi. It's Eric. Um...
something bad has happened.

34:26.045 --> 34:27.525
Can you come and pick me up?

34:38.565 --> 34:40.525
What are you gonna tell Jackson?

34:41.445 --> 34:42.925
-Diarrhea attack.
-[both chuckle]

34:43.005 --> 34:44.365
-God.
-Heh heh.

34:45.325 --> 34:47.405
He's never gonna
speak to me again, is he?

34:48.445 --> 34:49.845
Why didn't you say goodbye?

34:51.325 --> 34:52.605
I was letting him off the hook.

34:53.605 --> 34:57.085
They're not gonna want their golden boy
dating someone like me anyway, so...

34:57.165 --> 34:58.805
why go through the fake stuff?

35:00.525 --> 35:02.805
Yeah, well--ahem--
If you don't open yourself up,

35:02.885 --> 35:04.645
-you're never gonna find out.
-No.

35:04.725 --> 35:07.525
-No therapy, remember.
-What? Oh. Oh, sorry.

35:12.845 --> 35:13.845
You all right?

35:14.765 --> 35:15.765
I've got a jumper.

35:17.125 --> 35:19.085
-So chivalrous.
-Heh.

35:19.165 --> 35:22.085
Well, actually,
there's Nutella on it, so not exactly.

35:22.165 --> 35:23.165
Great.

35:26.645 --> 35:27.925
[owl hoots]

35:31.965 --> 35:34.445
Why are your arms so freakishly long?

35:34.525 --> 35:36.005
They're not.

35:36.085 --> 35:39.325
-Just roll up your sleeves, you fool.
-Heh.

35:41.765 --> 35:42.765
This one.

35:53.925 --> 35:55.085
I'm a virgin.

35:55.165 --> 35:56.765
-What?
-I...

35:57.525 --> 36:01.005
I'm a virgin, and I-I thought
you should know that I am.

36:01.085 --> 36:05.405
-Yeah, that's totally cool. No judgment.
-Cool. Glad I shared.

36:08.005 --> 36:09.245
I'm gonna head off now.

36:10.365 --> 36:11.685
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah.

36:11.765 --> 36:12.765
Yeah.

36:17.165 --> 36:19.965
-You okay getting home?
-Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

36:23.925 --> 36:24.965
[sighs]

36:40.645 --> 36:41.845
Mom.

36:43.205 --> 36:44.565
Is everything all right?

36:48.925 --> 36:49.925
Eric.

36:51.965 --> 36:53.845
[Jean] I'll leave you boys to talk.

36:59.925 --> 37:04.245
I'm sorry, dude. This... This thing
came up with-with Maeve and the clinic,

37:04.325 --> 37:09.085
and it was serious,
but this crazy thing happened.

37:09.165 --> 37:11.165
I think we had a moment.
[stammers]

37:11.245 --> 37:13.925
It was full-on, and I... I messed it up.

37:15.845 --> 37:18.485
-What happened to your face?
-You were with Maeve?

37:18.565 --> 37:22.645
Yeah. Yeah, it was-it was because of
the photo that's going round.

37:22.725 --> 37:26.765
You left me alone dressed like this
because you wanted to hang out with Maeve?

37:26.845 --> 37:28.645
No, no, not on purpose. But--

37:28.725 --> 37:32.485
Oh, you are so self-centered.
You don't care about anyone but yourself.

37:33.565 --> 37:36.365
What? That-That's not fair.

37:36.445 --> 37:38.765
Eric... why are you so angry?

37:38.845 --> 37:41.365
Because we've been friends
since we were nine years old,

37:41.445 --> 37:44.765
and you've abandoned me for someone
that you've known for five seconds.

37:44.845 --> 37:47.565
You've changed, man.
The old Otis would never do that.

37:47.645 --> 37:49.285
-I didn't--
-No, but you did.

37:49.365 --> 37:52.885
You seriously think that she likes you?
You can't even touch yourself, man.

37:52.965 --> 37:53.965
Wake up.

37:55.405 --> 37:57.205
I'm self-obsessed?

37:57.285 --> 38:00.885
You can't stand it if you're not
the center of attention all the time.

38:00.965 --> 38:02.285
Well, at least I'm not delusional.

38:02.365 --> 38:04.605
No, the truth is, Eric,
you're only angry right now

38:04.685 --> 38:06.565
because I'm getting a life
beyond our friendship,

38:06.645 --> 38:07.925
and you can't deal with it.

38:08.645 --> 38:09.925
[laughs]

38:12.165 --> 38:15.285
I rang your mom to pick me up
because this is where I felt safe.

38:17.765 --> 38:19.125
I think I made a mistake.
