00:11.817 --> 00:14.187
Those creatures are here.

00:14.421 --> 00:16.413
They can take your soul.

00:16.513 --> 00:18.154
It was a man, but he didn't look human.

00:18.156 --> 00:19.761
That had to scare the [bleep] out of you.

00:19.763 --> 00:22.133
They have, like, pointed ears, sharp teeth.

00:22.135 --> 00:24.036
Seems like she's possessed sometimes.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.833
A lot of [bleep] pain in this room.

00:27.133 --> 00:30.218
I live in constant fear we're being haunted.

00:30.220 --> 00:34.193
What is going on here?

00:34.374 --> 00:36.569
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:36.604 --> 00:39.740
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.643
What's happening?

00:40.817 --> 00:43.046
I see dead people.

00:43.048 --> 00:45.089
It seems like a devil.

00:45.159 --> 00:47.028
I speak to dead people.

00:47.128 --> 00:48.550
He's pissed off.

00:48.650 --> 00:50.182
And they speak to me.

00:50.282 --> 00:52.001
I felt real fear.

00:52.201 --> 00:55.412
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.414 --> 00:56.687
I think she's being murdered.

00:56.787 --> 00:58.489
I rely on my partner.

00:58.524 --> 01:00.192
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.196
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:02.298 --> 01:03.904
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:03.946 --> 01:07.608
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.610 --> 01:08.810
Nobody believes me.

01:08.812 --> 01:10.278
It's my job to reveal them.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.056
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:12.122 --> 01:13.590
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.690 --> 01:15.831
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.535
Until the very end.

01:17.537 --> 01:19.091
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:19.107 --> 01:21.314
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.516 --> 01:22.885
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:22.918 --> 01:24.823
Or time to get out.

01:24.923 --> 01:27.366
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.633 --> 01:49.405
I'm in the heart of the rust belt...
Toledo, Ohio.

01:49.407 --> 01:52.543
I'm heading over to meet
with a woman named Angie.

01:52.545 --> 01:55.784
She says everyone in the
family's being affected.

01:55.786 --> 02:00.024
They're being pushed, scratched,
burnt, and even molested.

02:00.026 --> 02:02.497
When I heard this on the phone, I got upset.

02:02.499 --> 02:04.099
And I'm really hoping we can help her out.

02:13.114 --> 02:15.148
Before Amy arrives,

02:15.150 --> 02:18.918
I look for any leading information.

02:18.920 --> 02:22.790
This house is filled with
photos and religious symbols.

02:22.792 --> 02:25.061
Once they're covered or removed,

02:25.063 --> 02:27.831
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:44.728 --> 02:46.829
What the hell?

02:50.068 --> 02:52.770
There's a male here who...

02:52.772 --> 02:57.044
knows how it used to be and is disturbed,

02:57.046 --> 03:01.214
so he's very much
functioning in that reality,

03:01.216 --> 03:02.582
and he's angry.

03:02.584 --> 03:03.982
He's [bleep] pissed.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.384
There's something wrong with his head.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.956
Mm.

03:09.958 --> 03:13.591
The head pain is so bad.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.608
So, Angie, I'm glad I'm here

03:27.610 --> 03:29.844
'cause you sounded pretty
upset on the phone.

03:29.846 --> 03:32.212
So,
just give me an idea of what's happening.

03:32.214 --> 03:34.584
- We've been here about 12 years.
- Okay.

03:34.586 --> 03:37.355
Shortly after we moved in is
when the activity started.

03:37.357 --> 03:40.854
At first, it just started out as noises.

03:40.856 --> 03:44.056
It increased to apparitions.

03:44.058 --> 03:47.256
It's getting now to the point
where it's getting violent.

03:47.258 --> 03:50.825
We've had a couple of episodes
where we've been burned.

03:50.827 --> 03:53.761
We've been scratched,

03:53.763 --> 03:55.761
we've been pushed, we've been shoved.

03:55.763 --> 03:58.595
I live in constant fear here.

03:58.597 --> 03:59.864
Who do you live here with?

03:59.866 --> 04:01.699
I live here with my partner, Leslie,

04:01.701 --> 04:03.100
my daughter, Maggie,

04:03.102 --> 04:06.372
and my 2-year-old grandson, Nathan.

04:06.374 --> 04:08.676
Oh, he's precious.

04:08.678 --> 04:11.879
It seems like it got
worse after he was born.

04:14.052 --> 04:16.185
- Is he being affected by this?
- He is.

04:16.188 --> 04:18.821
We were sitting in the living room,
watching TV.

04:18.822 --> 04:21.661
He was sitting on the floor,
playing with his toys,

04:21.663 --> 04:24.495
and we seen him literally
lift up off the ground

04:24.497 --> 04:26.463
and was shoved a good foot and a half.

04:26.465 --> 04:29.503
I fear greatly for him

04:29.505 --> 04:32.239
because he's unable to protect himself,

04:32.241 --> 04:34.641
and I feel like we can't protect him,
either.

04:34.643 --> 04:37.780
- Why don't you just move?
- We're into it financially.

04:37.782 --> 04:40.016
We put all of our money
into buying this home,

04:40.018 --> 04:42.183
and we can't afford to move.

04:42.185 --> 04:44.317
Do you know any history of the house at all?

04:44.319 --> 04:45.384
Me, personally, no.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.520
I don't know any history of the house.

04:47.522 --> 04:49.654
Have you ever had paranormal activity

04:49.656 --> 04:51.824
- prior to moving into this house?
- Never.

04:51.826 --> 04:54.324
- I was never a believer.
- What about now?

04:54.326 --> 04:56.890
I believe it wholeheartedly.

04:56.892 --> 04:58.258
We're being haunted.

05:03.229 --> 05:05.963
There's something here,

05:05.965 --> 05:07.766
and it came in through the front door.

05:11.534 --> 05:15.033
These things...
they look like little [bleep] demons,

05:15.035 --> 05:17.502
and they're getting too out of hand.

05:18.704 --> 05:22.039
That's what this older dude was saying.

05:22.041 --> 05:25.574
And he says, "I can't handle that.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.607
"I can't get involved in that.

05:27.609 --> 05:29.940
I can't do anything about that."

05:29.942 --> 05:34.244
Things have just gotten too bad.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.478
He can't fight anymore
because they're gonna get him.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.814
They can take your soul.

05:48.063 --> 05:50.898
Okay, what's going on in here?

05:50.900 --> 05:53.334
I've seen various apparitions in here.

05:53.336 --> 05:56.269
There was an older gentleman I seen in here,

05:56.271 --> 05:58.036
wearing kind of like a suit.

05:58.038 --> 05:59.470
Grayish hair.

05:59.472 --> 06:02.173
He startles me at first,
but he doesn't seem threatening.

06:02.175 --> 06:04.043
Okay,
what time period do you think he's from?

06:04.045 --> 06:07.277
I would say early 1900s.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.715
If you saw a photo,
would you be able to identify him?

06:09.717 --> 06:11.250
I would.

06:11.252 --> 06:12.417
Now, what else are you seeing in here?

06:12.419 --> 06:14.253
One time in the stairwell,

06:14.255 --> 06:18.025
there was an apparition of a little boy.

06:18.027 --> 06:19.327
Can you describe him?

06:19.329 --> 06:21.630
He appeared to have been in a fire.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.566
He had a burnt face, burnt arms.

06:24.568 --> 06:27.770
Angie, I got to do my due diligence and ask

06:27.772 --> 06:29.672
questions you're not gonna like, but...

06:29.674 --> 06:32.574
Okay. Medications? Alcohol abuse?

06:32.576 --> 06:34.277
Anything that may cause you to hallucinate

06:34.279 --> 06:35.144
and see these things?

06:35.146 --> 06:36.578
No, sir.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.710
- I seen one other one.
- What's that?

06:39.712 --> 06:42.412
This one bothers me
'cause it really scared me.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.750
It was a man, but he didn't look human.

06:48.752 --> 06:51.021
He was in the mirror.

06:51.023 --> 06:54.589
He had two horns off the top of his head.

06:54.591 --> 06:56.723
Big teeth.

06:56.725 --> 06:58.258
I would say at least 6 foot,

06:58.260 --> 07:01.794
and I seen him kind of let out a growl,

07:01.796 --> 07:03.665
and it came right at me.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.765
"Foof," right through me,

07:05.767 --> 07:08.602
and I immediately broke out into tears,

07:08.604 --> 07:10.470
felt like I was gonna faint.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.138
I was sick to my stomach.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.040
- That had to scare the [bleep] out of you.
- It did.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.241
All I can tell you, Steve,

07:15.243 --> 07:17.311
it was the scariest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

07:21.652 --> 07:27.821
Those demons...
they are very [bleep] weird-looking.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.558
They kind of have, like, bat faces.

07:30.560 --> 07:34.693
They have, like, pointed ears, big eyes,

07:34.695 --> 07:39.133
sharp teeth,
kind of centered on this female.

07:44.678 --> 07:46.778
Okay, what's going on in here?

07:46.780 --> 07:49.014
I've had things move around in the room.

07:49.016 --> 07:51.787
I've had my glasses moved.

07:51.789 --> 07:54.256
You sure it's not your
grandson maybe playing games

07:54.258 --> 07:55.458
or just moving stuff on you?

07:55.460 --> 07:56.493
Probably not.

07:56.495 --> 07:59.630
He's two, and most of it's up high...

07:59.632 --> 08:02.567
the stuff that's moved...
and I put my glasses up high,

08:02.569 --> 08:04.669
- so no, it's not him.
- All right.

08:04.671 --> 08:06.104
Anything else?

08:06.106 --> 08:08.472
I was laying in bed, sleeping one night,

08:08.474 --> 08:13.240
and I had a physical presence come over me.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.441
I felt like I was being pinned to the bed.

08:15.443 --> 08:21.678
My shirt was pulled up around my chest area.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.213
- Okay.
- I felt like I was being

08:23.215 --> 08:25.619
physically assaulted at the moment.

08:25.621 --> 08:26.853
Talking about sexually assaulted?

08:26.855 --> 08:28.886
Yes, sir.

08:28.888 --> 08:33.960
I just remember feeling... violated.

08:33.962 --> 08:35.260
I was just crying.

08:35.261 --> 08:37.496
Okay. So, how long did it last?

08:37.498 --> 08:39.600
It seemed like it lasted forever,

08:39.602 --> 08:42.304
but I started praying,

08:42.306 --> 08:44.436
and within a couple of minutes, it stopped.

08:49.313 --> 08:52.252
There's a lot of things

08:52.254 --> 08:53.889
that went on up here.

09:02.897 --> 09:04.830
There's, like, panic.

09:04.832 --> 09:06.599
Oh, geez.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.236
Uh...

09:08.238 --> 09:11.375
Oh.

09:11.377 --> 09:14.679
I am seeing a woman.

09:14.681 --> 09:18.745
She's being...

09:18.747 --> 09:23.450
physically attacked by nothing... like,
dragged.

09:23.452 --> 09:27.120
What the [bleep] is going on here?

09:28.490 --> 09:31.292
She's not the only one.

09:34.529 --> 09:36.600
Holy [bleep]

09:39.103 --> 09:42.304
This is, like, one of the worst rooms.

09:42.306 --> 09:44.006
Why?

09:44.008 --> 09:45.910
There's definitely an agent here

09:45.912 --> 09:48.915
who's [bleep] very unhappy

09:48.917 --> 09:54.087
and not stable and lashing out.

09:57.862 --> 09:59.796
It's a poltergeist.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.437
Maggie, I was talking to your mom,

10:25.439 --> 10:27.706
and she was telling me about everything
that's going on in the house.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.243
Mm-hmm.

10:29.245 --> 10:30.779
- Now, this is your son's room?
- Yes.

10:30.781 --> 10:32.982
Apparently,
your mom said she actually saw him

10:32.984 --> 10:35.916
get picked up and kind of thrown or pushed.

10:35.918 --> 10:37.617
Yeah, it has happened.

10:37.619 --> 10:39.087
He was playing in his room.

10:39.089 --> 10:42.356
I was cleaning up,
and I heard him hit the ground,

10:42.358 --> 10:45.629
and when I came into his room,
he was flat on his back,

10:45.631 --> 10:47.531
and his face was bloodshot red.

10:47.533 --> 10:50.931
- Now, was there anything he
could have jumped off of? - No.

10:50.933 --> 10:53.168
He wasn't climbing on anything.
He didn't trip over anything.

10:53.170 --> 10:56.738
As a mother, I know his cries,

10:56.740 --> 10:58.938
and it was definitely something
I've never heard before.

10:58.940 --> 11:00.638
Okay, so, this was a terrifying cry?

11:00.640 --> 11:03.677
Yeah,
this was... he wanted to get out of here.

11:03.679 --> 11:06.580
Something scared him.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.614
Okay, anything else going on up here?

11:08.616 --> 11:09.614
Yeah, actually.

11:09.616 --> 11:11.380
One day, it was just me and him here,

11:11.382 --> 11:13.583
and I came up to check on him,

11:13.585 --> 11:15.450
and he was leaning out of his window,

11:15.452 --> 11:18.687
throwing his toys out,
and this window's never unlocked.

11:18.689 --> 11:20.757
There's no way he could unlock the window.

11:20.759 --> 11:23.160
He can't open doors, like doorknobs.

11:23.162 --> 11:27.899
I got really scared because he
could have easily fallen out.

11:27.901 --> 11:30.067
- You said it's always locked?
- It's locked right now.

11:30.069 --> 11:32.237
So, who would have unlocked it?

11:32.239 --> 11:35.509
It's only me and him here,
and I definitely didn't do it.

11:35.511 --> 11:38.845
- But it was closed when you last saw it?
- Oh, yeah.

11:38.847 --> 11:42.185
And there was nobody else around?

11:42.187 --> 11:44.055
Nope.

11:44.057 --> 11:47.659
That's a problem.

11:55.334 --> 11:57.505
This is not good.

12:01.809 --> 12:04.144
There might be someone here,

12:04.146 --> 12:07.846
at a very [bleep] young age,

12:07.848 --> 12:10.648
figured out that they were capable

12:10.650 --> 12:12.582
of manipulating their environment,

12:12.584 --> 12:16.051
and those are why those creatures are here.

12:19.421 --> 12:22.688
There's a relationship there

12:22.690 --> 12:25.823
between this thing and this living person.

12:25.825 --> 12:28.894
The older man was trying to stop this,

12:28.896 --> 12:32.364
then it changed, and now there's more.

12:32.366 --> 12:34.032
There's more of them.

12:43.843 --> 12:46.247
Leslie,
I was talking to your partner, Angie,

12:46.249 --> 12:48.348
and I spoke to her daughter, Maggie,

12:48.350 --> 12:50.115
they seemed pretty upset

12:50.117 --> 12:51.682
- about the things that are happening here.
- Yes.

12:51.684 --> 12:53.617
- I mean, she's your partner.
- Yes.

12:53.619 --> 12:56.386
- I mean, she looks like she's taking it hard.
- Yeah, she does.

12:56.388 --> 12:58.189
Hard on her and makes it hard on me

12:58.191 --> 13:00.492
- to watch her go through some of the stuff.
- Right.

13:00.494 --> 13:04.227
The fighting, and, just... it's hard.

13:04.229 --> 13:06.493
- The mood swings.
- Especially Maggie.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.728
Nothing.

13:07.730 --> 13:10.498
I swear,
it seems like she's possessed sometimes...

13:10.500 --> 13:13.737
just angry and mean and hateful she gets.

13:13.739 --> 13:15.306
I don't like the drama.

13:15.308 --> 13:18.341
Just want everything to go back to normal.

13:18.343 --> 13:20.677
Well,
that brings me to a question I have for you.

13:20.679 --> 13:22.681
I mean, everybody's experienced something.

13:22.683 --> 13:23.917
- Have you?
- Yes, I have.

13:23.919 --> 13:25.418
Okay, like what?

13:25.420 --> 13:27.854
My cross on my neck got ripped off

13:27.856 --> 13:30.054
and thrown across the floor.

13:30.056 --> 13:32.790
- You mean, you had a necklace?
- Yes.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.356
And it ripped off your chest?

13:34.358 --> 13:35.690
Ripped off. Yes. Broke.

13:36.993 --> 13:39.793
Thrown across the hardwood floor and slid.

13:39.795 --> 13:42.957
That's...

13:42.959 --> 13:45.327
It was strange.

13:45.329 --> 13:47.129
- Strange? It's a little bit scary.
- Yeah.

13:47.131 --> 13:48.732
- Was anybody else home?
- No.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.465
So, what did you end up
doing when that happened?

13:51.467 --> 13:53.533
- Did you get your cross again?
- Yeah, I sure did.

13:53.535 --> 13:55.401
I picked it back up, and I said,
"You think you broke it?

13:55.403 --> 13:57.870
You didn't 'cause I got another
clasp I can put it on,"

13:57.872 --> 13:59.672
and I stuck it back on another one.

13:59.674 --> 14:01.173
I don't know what my partner's gonna say.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.043
She may tell you that whatever's here,
you can't fix.

14:03.045 --> 14:04.415
You got to get the hell out of here.

14:04.417 --> 14:05.885
I mean, how would you feel about that?

14:05.887 --> 14:07.318
I'd probably get the hell out of here.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.153
- You would?
- Mm-hmm.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.859
There's the battle.

14:14.861 --> 14:16.925
There's this [bleep] battle going on

14:16.927 --> 14:20.397
between the living and these things.

14:20.399 --> 14:22.230
Do you know what these things are?

14:22.232 --> 14:24.299
I don't believe they were ever alive.

14:24.301 --> 14:27.538
I guess you would call them,
like, some kind of demons.

14:27.540 --> 14:30.041
They're kept out.

14:30.043 --> 14:34.978
They can be kept at bay because
they respond to religion,

14:34.980 --> 14:38.715
but it doesn't matter because
the poltergeist is always here.

14:44.087 --> 14:46.020
There's a lot of pain in this room.

14:46.022 --> 14:48.823
A lot of [bleep] pain in this room.

14:48.825 --> 14:53.325
The living... they're fighting,

14:53.327 --> 14:56.160
and they're crying, and it never stops.

14:56.162 --> 14:59.631
These people...
what they're doing to each other, it's awful.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.432
I can't stand it anymore.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.500
Would you say it's dangerous
for the living to be here?

15:03.502 --> 15:05.301
The house isn't the issue.

15:05.303 --> 15:06.434
What is?

15:06.436 --> 15:08.671
They are.

15:08.673 --> 15:10.175
They who?

15:10.177 --> 15:11.977
The living people.

15:24.848 --> 15:27.017
Angie didn't know any history about her home,

15:27.019 --> 15:28.586
so I made a few calls.

15:28.588 --> 15:30.955
And a retired homicide detective tells me

15:30.957 --> 15:32.957
a famous criminal used to live there.

15:32.959 --> 15:35.359
He did some research into it for me,

15:35.361 --> 15:37.094
and he found some information he says

15:37.096 --> 15:38.863
will definitely help my investigation.

15:48.237 --> 15:50.005
Well, Bob, thanks for meeting me.

15:50.007 --> 15:51.505
- I appreciate it.
- Sure.

15:51.507 --> 15:54.072
Now, you mentioned on the phone
there was an actual criminal

15:54.074 --> 15:55.871
that lived in the property
I'm investigating.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.272
Right. Yes, there was.

15:57.274 --> 16:00.510
Clarence Brown had moved into
that home with his family.

16:00.512 --> 16:02.311
He was young.

16:02.313 --> 16:04.813
He was 17 at the time in 1930.

16:04.815 --> 16:07.982
Of course,
the Depression hit the family real bad,

16:07.984 --> 16:10.820
and they lost most of everything they had,

16:10.822 --> 16:14.159
even though they had had a
lucrative printing business.

16:14.161 --> 16:16.293
Clarence especially took it pretty hard.

16:16.295 --> 16:17.993
He didn't think the government

16:17.995 --> 16:20.627
put enough money into the local economy,

16:20.629 --> 16:23.231
and he was gonna do his part to help out,

16:23.233 --> 16:27.467
and he got this idea about
counterfeiting bills.

16:27.469 --> 16:29.602
He kind of felt like he was a Robin Hood.

16:29.604 --> 16:31.238
Here's a picture of him.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.441
He was just a clean-cut,
ordinary-looking kid, you know.

16:34.443 --> 16:38.178
Now, was he operating out of
the house I'm investigating?

16:38.180 --> 16:39.747
He operated out of the house,
and then, I guess,

16:39.749 --> 16:43.117
part of it moved over to
the family printing business

16:43.119 --> 16:45.222
across the river on Huron Street.

16:45.224 --> 16:47.057
How big of an operation
are we talking about?

16:47.059 --> 16:48.757
Well, they got to the point

16:48.759 --> 16:50.792
of being considered international.

16:50.794 --> 16:54.529
There was a lot of their
money showing up in Indiana,

16:54.531 --> 16:56.464
Michigan, the surrounding states,

16:56.466 --> 16:59.236
Illinois, even into Windsor, Canada.

16:59.238 --> 17:02.407
- So, who was all involved?
Was it just this guy, Clarence? - Well, no.

17:02.409 --> 17:05.243
Clarence and Sherman,
his dad, and his brother,

17:05.246 --> 17:06.378
and two other associates.

17:06.381 --> 17:07.882
Okay, so, he basically ran it.

17:07.884 --> 17:10.452
- Yes, he did.
- So, what happens next?

17:10.454 --> 17:13.820
Eventually, he got caught.
They were busted in 1935.

17:13.823 --> 17:17.529
They raided the Huron Street plant

17:17.531 --> 17:20.896
and seized probably $20,000 there

17:20.898 --> 17:22.830
- and a bunch of equipment.
- Okay.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.231
That led them over to

17:24.233 --> 17:27.065
the house that you're
looking into on east side.

17:27.067 --> 17:30.099
Got another 6 grand there
and a lot of equipment.

17:30.101 --> 17:32.036
A lot of money back then.
That's a lot of money today.

17:32.038 --> 17:35.568
Yeah, in today's figures,
it would be about $340,000.

17:35.570 --> 17:38.940
Now, when all is said and done,
how many people got arrested?

17:38.942 --> 17:40.474
There were five total, yes.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.545
It was Clarence; his father, Sherman;

17:43.547 --> 17:46.382
brother Louis; and two other associates.

17:46.384 --> 17:49.648
But when it came to trial,
according to this article here,

17:49.650 --> 17:52.985
Clarence took the heat for the entire family

17:52.987 --> 17:55.557
and got a 31/2-year sentence,

17:55.559 --> 17:57.393
and he did about 21/2 years.

18:01.701 --> 18:04.103
The older male,

18:04.105 --> 18:06.574
I feel him very much
involved with the structure.

18:06.576 --> 18:09.109
Do you know anything about
what he was like in life?

18:09.111 --> 18:13.780
I would say that he was a...

18:13.782 --> 18:16.148
no bull[bleep] kind of guy.

18:16.150 --> 18:21.586
I would guess that he might have been,
like, a boss

18:21.588 --> 18:23.656
because he's very much like,

18:23.658 --> 18:26.225
"This is what's going on. This is what
we're doing. This is what's happening."

18:26.227 --> 18:28.196
Does the old man interact with the living?

18:28.198 --> 18:32.503
It think he's tried talking to them.

18:32.505 --> 18:37.010
He's definitely trying to
keep these demons at bay.

18:37.012 --> 18:39.746
I think he was also trying

18:39.748 --> 18:44.118
to give warnings about what's going on.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.492
Like, I see him talking to
somebody laying in bed,

18:50.494 --> 18:54.364
trying to explain things to them.

18:57.402 --> 18:59.306
So, he gets sentenced to 31/2 years.

18:59.308 --> 19:01.108
- He does 21/2, and he gets out.
- Right.

19:01.110 --> 19:03.345
Okay, does he go back to counterfeiting?
I mean, what's he do?

19:03.347 --> 19:05.079
No, he gave up the counterfeiting,

19:05.081 --> 19:06.913
moved back into your clients' house.

19:06.915 --> 19:08.615
His mom lived there, too.

19:08.617 --> 19:10.483
He got a job at a local printing shop,

19:10.485 --> 19:12.619
and then he got married in 1940.

19:12.621 --> 19:16.323
And this was the wedding
of Clarence and his wife.

19:16.325 --> 19:19.460
And him and his wife had three little boys.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.330
Okay, so, what happens to this guy?

19:21.332 --> 19:26.100
Well, things went real
bad in 1948 initially,

19:26.102 --> 19:27.868
when his mother died.

19:27.870 --> 19:30.403
It hit him pretty hard.

19:30.405 --> 19:34.174
Kind of started into a
downward spiral mentally.

19:34.176 --> 19:36.642
- Did she die in the house?
- She died at home.

19:36.644 --> 19:38.878
I have the death certificate here.

19:41.118 --> 19:43.653
Okay, so, cerebral hemorrhages.

19:43.655 --> 19:45.418
- So, it was a natural cause.
- Right.

19:45.420 --> 19:46.820
So, what happens after that?

19:46.822 --> 19:49.689
Things started spiraling downhill.

19:49.691 --> 19:51.958
He was developing a real paranoia.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.897
He was convinced the
government was out to get him.

19:54.899 --> 19:56.330
They were spying on him.

19:56.332 --> 20:00.100
He had pretty much
alienated his wife and sons.

20:00.102 --> 20:03.106
It got so bad that she
actually had him committed.

20:03.108 --> 20:05.976
They used electroshock therapy on him,

20:05.978 --> 20:07.677
which apparently didn't help,

20:07.679 --> 20:09.679
and it got so bad that she eventually

20:09.681 --> 20:11.380
had him committed to a
mental institution...

20:13.149 --> 20:15.751
where he spent the
last 26 years of his life,

20:15.753 --> 20:18.089
dying at age 83.

20:18.091 --> 20:22.125
This guy was the leader of a
pretty good-sized operation

20:22.127 --> 20:24.096
early on in his life,

20:24.098 --> 20:26.066
and he died, wasted down to nothing.

20:33.278 --> 20:36.411
This guy is [bleep] sick.

20:36.413 --> 20:38.848
Do you know how he died?
Something with his head.

20:41.053 --> 20:42.787
He had a lot of pain in his head.

20:42.789 --> 20:44.320
That's all I know.

20:46.759 --> 20:48.893
He was sick for a long time. I know that.

20:50.228 --> 20:51.928
This [bleep] so thick.

20:51.930 --> 20:54.599
I don't know how they
[bleep] even stay here.

21:08.975 --> 21:11.509
So far,
I've uncovered a major counterfeit ring

21:11.511 --> 21:12.877
tied to my clients' property,

21:12.879 --> 21:14.313
where the previous owner

21:14.315 --> 21:16.648
was committed to a mental institution.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.353
But I need to see if there's anything else.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.894
Searching through old archives,

21:22.896 --> 21:24.728
I find something I didn't expect...

21:26.898 --> 21:30.103
a deadly explosion that happened in 1898

21:30.105 --> 21:34.210
right down the street from my clients'
house.

21:34.212 --> 21:37.313
I've called out a local reporter

21:37.315 --> 21:40.649
who says it was one of the worst
accidents in Toledo's history.

21:49.092 --> 21:53.062
This explosion I came across...
what exactly happened?

21:53.064 --> 21:55.128
So, there was the Union Railroad,

21:55.130 --> 21:56.696
which had a grain elevator.

21:56.698 --> 21:58.998
Here it is right here.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.003
On the night of September 21, 1898,

22:04.005 --> 22:05.638
25 people were working there.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.073
They had just received a big
shipment of oats, and they were,

22:08.075 --> 22:09.475
you know, processing these oats,

22:09.477 --> 22:12.378
but they didn't have the
safety mechanisms in place.

22:12.380 --> 22:14.412
So, there were highly
flammable dust particles

22:14.414 --> 22:16.945
- in the air from this device.
- Okay.

22:16.947 --> 22:19.315
And somehow or another,
these floating dust particles

22:19.317 --> 22:21.717
got into the furnace,

22:21.719 --> 22:23.617
which then exploded.

22:23.619 --> 22:25.851
This is the aftermath.

22:25.853 --> 22:29.687
This is the rubble from
the explosion and the fire.

22:32.455 --> 22:33.689
Wow.

22:33.691 --> 22:35.626
I mean, it just looks like

22:35.628 --> 22:37.459
somebody dropped a 500-pound bomb on it.

22:37.461 --> 22:38.694
Oh, yeah.

22:39.795 --> 22:41.730
Where my clients'
property is is pretty close.

22:41.732 --> 22:43.402
What would it have felt like for them?

22:43.404 --> 22:44.836
It felt like an earthquake.

22:44.838 --> 22:46.304
It broke out windows.

22:46.306 --> 22:48.475
It melted rail road cars.

22:48.477 --> 22:52.848
Everything with a 200-foot
radius was consumed by flames.

22:52.850 --> 22:54.414
Wow.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.814
15 people were killed.

22:56.816 --> 22:59.252
- Two of those bodies were never recovered.
- At all?

22:59.254 --> 23:01.920
Essentially,
they were just reduced to ashes.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.390
One of the bodies that was never recovered

23:05.392 --> 23:08.963
was the youngest son of the superintendent,
Mr. Parks.

23:08.965 --> 23:10.665
Harold was 6.

23:10.667 --> 23:13.835
And then, shortly after he died,

23:13.837 --> 23:16.102
his 10-year-old son, Hamilton,

23:16.104 --> 23:19.274
- also died as a result of the explosion.
- Wow.

23:19.276 --> 23:22.079
He also had his daughter,
Grace, a 19-year-old,

23:22.081 --> 23:25.083
who died a day after the accident.

23:25.085 --> 23:26.985
That's a real tragedy.

23:26.987 --> 23:29.455
One of the headlines referred to it

23:29.457 --> 23:31.390
as "The Holocaust at Toledo."

23:37.899 --> 23:42.032
I'm seeing people running.

23:42.034 --> 23:43.434
They're screaming.

23:43.436 --> 23:47.836
I'm just getting a lot of physical trauma.

23:49.072 --> 23:52.176
It was something that was huge.

23:54.413 --> 23:57.147
Something unexpected, something very big.

23:57.149 --> 23:59.116
Getting a big accident.

24:00.654 --> 24:02.354
Like a building collapsing on them.

24:11.795 --> 24:15.667
There were several entities
that stood out during my walk,

24:15.669 --> 24:17.636
but what has me the most concerned

24:17.638 --> 24:19.837
are the demon creatures
tormenting the living.

24:19.839 --> 24:23.676
There were three or four
that came from the closet,

24:23.678 --> 24:26.347
and there was a small kid,

24:26.349 --> 24:30.021
and one of them was standing behind him.

24:30.023 --> 24:32.191
Okay.

24:32.193 --> 24:34.963
The nose was kind of like a pig's nose...

24:36.366 --> 24:39.099
and it had, like, fangs.

24:40.634 --> 24:42.835
- What about the build?
- Very thin.

24:42.837 --> 24:46.532
Longer than the average arms.

24:52.043 --> 24:54.241
Is this what you saw?

24:57.209 --> 25:00.611
Yes, that's what I saw.

25:24.019 --> 25:26.755
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

25:26.757 --> 25:29.257
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

25:29.259 --> 25:31.458
and our clients for the first time.

25:33.580 --> 25:34.385
Amy, I'd like you to meet

25:34.485 --> 25:36.719
the three ladies that live in this house.

25:36.721 --> 25:38.387
This is Maggie.

25:38.389 --> 25:40.187
This is Angie, Maggie's mom,

25:40.189 --> 25:43.691
and this is Leslie, Angie's partner.

25:43.693 --> 25:45.759
All three of them are
having a tough time here,

25:45.761 --> 25:47.027
and they've experienced a lot,

25:47.029 --> 25:49.064
but the main reason we're here

25:49.066 --> 25:51.929
is for Maggie's 2-year-old son, Nathan.

25:52.896 --> 25:54.866
Aww.

25:54.868 --> 25:57.036
Now, the ladies don't think
it's safe for any of them,

25:57.038 --> 25:59.236
but they're more concerned for him.

25:59.238 --> 26:02.041
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

26:02.043 --> 26:05.144
I'll ask her to tell us about her walk.

26:09.418 --> 26:12.051
So, I was outside,

26:12.053 --> 26:14.386
and I started seeing all
of these dead people.

26:14.388 --> 26:18.392
They were not looking very good.

26:18.394 --> 26:21.194
It seemed like some kind of major accident

26:21.196 --> 26:23.632
that all of these people
had been involved with,

26:23.634 --> 26:26.802
and they were in a lot of pain and agony.

26:26.804 --> 26:32.710
It seemed to me like some kind of collapse,
like a building.

26:32.712 --> 26:34.980
It makes sense.

26:34.982 --> 26:36.983
One of the worst accidents
in Toledo's history

26:36.985 --> 26:40.418
happened only half a mile
from your residence here.

26:40.420 --> 26:44.158
It was an accident
involving the Union Railroad

26:44.160 --> 26:47.496
where the grain elevator was operated.

26:47.498 --> 26:50.598
This is what the factory looked like.

26:51.867 --> 26:55.673
Now, back on September 21, 1898,

26:55.675 --> 26:58.106
dust got into the boiler, and boom.

26:59.207 --> 27:01.510
Huge explosion.

27:01.512 --> 27:03.747
This is what it looked like after.

27:06.184 --> 27:07.751
It looks like a war zone.

27:07.753 --> 27:10.788
28 people were in the building.

27:10.790 --> 27:12.521
15 died.

27:13.654 --> 27:15.717
Only 13 bodies were recovered.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.753
Two actually just burnt to a crisp.

27:17.755 --> 27:19.189
They never recovered them.

27:19.191 --> 27:22.193
Worst part of this story is

27:22.195 --> 27:24.228
the three kids that were
killed because they were there,

27:24.230 --> 27:26.062
visiting their father,
who was the superintendent.

27:28.434 --> 27:31.533
I saw a young boy in the staircase,

27:31.535 --> 27:33.400
and he was burnt.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.070
He was burnt all over.

27:35.072 --> 27:38.305
I've also seen him at the top of the stairs.

27:38.307 --> 27:41.406
Now, could these kids
have come inside the house here?

27:41.408 --> 27:42.874
Yes.

27:42.876 --> 27:45.376
They're all over the neighborhood...
these people.

27:47.812 --> 27:50.144
What else did you see on your walk?

27:50.146 --> 27:51.813
I did meet an older male.

27:53.782 --> 27:59.825
This individual has been trying
to warn you for some time.

27:59.827 --> 28:02.228
He's here to protect.

28:02.230 --> 28:05.032
He's been trying to communicate to you

28:05.034 --> 28:08.605
via literally talking to you
or through dreams, as well.

28:10.309 --> 28:11.775
- You told me about the old man, right?
- Right.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.114
I often see him tinkering around.

28:14.116 --> 28:16.282
We call him Clarence.

28:16.284 --> 28:18.419
We don't know if that's his real name.

28:18.421 --> 28:19.955
Where'd you get the name Clarence from?

28:19.957 --> 28:22.456
I don't know. I just named him it.

28:22.458 --> 28:26.227
I don't know if it came to me in a dream.
They've been talking to you.

28:26.229 --> 28:28.061
You know what kind of guy
he was when he was alive?

28:28.063 --> 28:31.564
Straightforward guy,
just told you like it was.

28:31.566 --> 28:33.197
He liked to fix problems.

28:33.199 --> 28:35.300
He took charge. He took control.

28:35.302 --> 28:37.233
He was a boss.

28:37.235 --> 28:39.035
Um...

28:39.037 --> 28:42.004
I started to have...

28:42.006 --> 28:45.573
extreme pain in my head,

28:45.575 --> 28:48.443
and I knew that it was coming from him.

28:48.445 --> 28:50.912
Well, I'll tell you a story

28:50.914 --> 28:52.611
about a guy that lived in this house.

28:52.613 --> 28:54.346
Name was Clarence.

28:54.348 --> 28:56.513
Really?

28:56.515 --> 28:58.213
Hmm.

28:58.215 --> 29:00.882
- Clarence Brown.
- My God.

29:00.884 --> 29:02.386
You didn't know that?

29:02.388 --> 29:05.324
Okay, he was 17 years old
when he moved here in 1930.

29:05.326 --> 29:08.294
Lived here with his father,
his mother, and his brother.

29:08.296 --> 29:10.463
Father had a printing shop in town.

29:10.465 --> 29:12.429
Depression hits, and they lose everything.

29:12.431 --> 29:14.800
Clarence is a 17-year-old kid.

29:14.802 --> 29:16.836
He decided, "You know what?

29:16.838 --> 29:18.970
"I'm gonna start up a
counterfeiting business

29:18.972 --> 29:23.374
right in the basement here and
in the shop in Huron Street."

29:23.376 --> 29:26.140
So, he employed his father, his brother,

29:26.142 --> 29:28.274
and they were printing up money

29:28.276 --> 29:29.976
to the point where it got international.

29:29.978 --> 29:32.646
He was pissed about the government

29:32.648 --> 29:36.381
not doing the right thing
and helping the city.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.518
So, he thought by making money

29:38.520 --> 29:41.154
and putting it into the community,
it would help things.

29:41.156 --> 29:44.724
So, it's 1935. The FBI busts him.

29:44.726 --> 29:47.828
- They arrested everybody... his father,
his brother. - Oh [bleep]

29:47.830 --> 29:49.030
He said, "No, no. It was all on me.

29:49.032 --> 29:50.633
I'm the one that came up
with this whole scheme."

29:50.635 --> 29:53.471
He took the hit,

29:53.473 --> 29:55.707
and he did 21/2 out of 31/2
years he was supposed to do.

29:55.709 --> 29:57.844
So, he gets out of jail, comes back,

29:57.846 --> 29:59.612
and moves back into this house,

29:59.614 --> 30:01.147
gets married to a woman named Florence.

30:01.149 --> 30:03.348
And this is a photo.

30:03.350 --> 30:07.185
This is him and Florence
when they got married.

30:07.187 --> 30:10.352
They had three boys and lived here.

30:10.354 --> 30:13.722
He goes straight, and he goes to
work for a local printing shop.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.422
1948, his mom,

30:15.424 --> 30:19.761
who lived in this house with him,
died in the house.

30:21.497 --> 30:24.833
That's when his life
kind of went for a turn.

30:24.835 --> 30:28.237
He starts getting mentally unstable.

30:28.239 --> 30:31.237
His wife tried everything...

30:31.239 --> 30:34.407
in and out of doctors,
electroshock therapy.

30:34.409 --> 30:38.781
1971, she had him committed
into a mental hospital.

30:38.783 --> 30:44.015
- He laid there for 26 years till he died,
1997. - Geez.

30:44.017 --> 30:46.220
Now, that head pain you were talking about.

30:46.222 --> 30:48.421
I have his death certificate.

30:48.423 --> 30:52.056
He died of cerebral atrophy.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.698
I got photos of him later on in life.

31:00.302 --> 31:03.105
That's him right there.

31:03.107 --> 31:06.309
- So, you never knew the name Clarence?
- I didn't.

31:06.311 --> 31:07.443
You're not bull[bleep] me, right?

31:07.445 --> 31:09.644
I'm not bull[bleep] I'm
not bull[bleep] you.

31:09.646 --> 31:11.244
It happened, Steve.

31:11.246 --> 31:14.814
He's been talking to her for years.

31:14.816 --> 31:18.149
- You're pretty sure you met Clarence?
- Yeah.

31:18.151 --> 31:19.616
I'm blown away myself.

31:19.618 --> 31:22.051
Makes me very emotional.

31:31.097 --> 31:34.997
A lot of issues were going on upstairs.

31:34.999 --> 31:39.039
When I went into the bedroom to the right,

31:39.041 --> 31:41.009
it almost felt like I was suffocating.

31:41.011 --> 31:43.544
There's somebody in there

31:43.546 --> 31:45.915
who's very unhappy and lashing out.

31:45.917 --> 31:49.019
That person was a possible
poltergeist agent.

31:49.021 --> 31:52.889
Their emotions were coming
out in a physical way

31:52.891 --> 31:55.193
and affecting their surroundings...

31:55.195 --> 31:57.361
objects moving without explanation

31:57.363 --> 32:00.430
and possible harm to others.

32:00.432 --> 32:01.699
Oh, my gosh.

32:01.701 --> 32:03.832
That was my old room.

32:03.834 --> 32:06.601
I have really, really bad mood swings.

32:06.603 --> 32:09.773
Sometimes,
I can just go from being really happy

32:09.775 --> 32:11.206
to being really, really pissed off.

32:14.679 --> 32:17.314
- Is there a poltergeist here?
- Absolutely.

32:17.316 --> 32:19.114
Is she the living agent?

32:19.116 --> 32:22.351
I don't know if she created the poltergeist,

32:22.353 --> 32:23.718
but she's definitely feeding it.

32:26.354 --> 32:28.688
It isn't a fully formed
entity at this point,

32:28.690 --> 32:31.122
but it can cause a lot of chaos.

32:31.124 --> 32:33.992
When I first walked upstairs,

32:33.994 --> 32:37.501
I did see a woman get physically attacked.

32:37.503 --> 32:41.208
I saw her get lifted off the floor

32:41.210 --> 32:43.510
and dragged across the little hallway.

32:44.811 --> 32:47.815
She wasn't the only one
being physically harmed.

32:50.721 --> 32:57.028
I was, uh... held down in the bed

32:57.030 --> 32:59.333
and sexually assaulted...

33:01.804 --> 33:03.071
in that bedroom.

33:03.073 --> 33:04.739
I couldn't breathe.

33:04.741 --> 33:06.442
I couldn't move.

33:06.444 --> 33:08.977
I don't know how long it lasted.

33:08.979 --> 33:11.280
It seemed like it lasted forever,

33:11.282 --> 33:15.549
and when it was gone, it was gone,

33:15.551 --> 33:16.950
but I was very sick after that.

33:16.952 --> 33:20.188
So, was this poltergeist what
could have attacked Angie?

33:20.190 --> 33:22.256
Oh, no. That, I think, is something else.

33:24.794 --> 33:29.864
The older man was telling
me that he had been fighting

33:29.866 --> 33:34.270
for quite some time a particular entity,

33:34.272 --> 33:36.105
but now there's more,

33:36.107 --> 33:40.806
and he can't contend with them any further.

33:40.808 --> 33:42.977
They're very strange-looking.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.878
They kind of have bat faces.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.511
Their mouths are kind of round,

33:46.513 --> 33:48.279
and they have, like, very sharp teeth.

33:48.281 --> 33:50.449
They have the pointed ears.

33:50.451 --> 33:53.349
I do not think that these
things were ever alive.

33:53.351 --> 33:57.820
I think they're innately, inherently evil.

33:57.822 --> 34:02.492
One thing I noticed was someone was saying

34:02.494 --> 34:04.993
some type of religious statement,

34:04.995 --> 34:09.268
and it did make them back... <i>back</i> up.

34:09.271 --> 34:12.373
So, for lack of a better word,

34:12.375 --> 34:15.212
I would say that these things
are some kind of demons.

34:17.914 --> 34:20.518
You guys say when you pray, it stops.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.219
Oh, yeah. It does.

34:22.222 --> 34:26.092
Also, the closet where I
saw most of these things

34:26.094 --> 34:28.964
was in the smaller room upstairs.

34:28.966 --> 34:31.465
That's my son's room.

34:31.467 --> 34:34.534
Is it possible that he's seen them?

34:34.536 --> 34:36.034
Yes.

34:36.036 --> 34:37.534
Because...

34:37.536 --> 34:41.306
he used to wake up with
really bad nightmares...

34:43.411 --> 34:45.810
and he's been pushed in his room before.

34:48.646 --> 34:52.083
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

35:00.855 --> 35:03.589
Oh, I feel sick.

35:05.325 --> 35:08.460
Are you kidding me?

35:17.437 --> 35:18.938
Oh, geez.

35:18.940 --> 35:21.438
That's the thing that I see.

35:41.122 --> 35:44.459
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

35:48.300 --> 35:50.902
Oh, I feel sick.

35:52.639 --> 35:54.140
Are you kidding me?

36:04.684 --> 36:06.254
Oh, geez.

36:06.256 --> 36:08.756
That's the thing that I see.

36:18.732 --> 36:23.205
More than likely,
that's the thing that attacked you.

36:25.875 --> 36:27.608
The big question for me now

36:27.610 --> 36:29.676
is are those things still in the closet?

36:29.678 --> 36:31.111
Um, yes.

36:39.288 --> 36:42.356
It's all right, baby.

36:46.493 --> 36:49.597
I just feel guilty.

36:49.599 --> 36:51.198
Why would you feel guilty, baby?

36:51.200 --> 36:55.839
Just remembering him waking up and...

36:57.410 --> 36:58.776
There's just been times

36:58.778 --> 37:01.244
where I've kind of just put
him back to bed in there.

37:01.246 --> 37:02.879
It just makes me feel guilty.

37:05.914 --> 37:09.386
When I went into the child's room,

37:09.388 --> 37:12.121
I became very upset.

37:12.123 --> 37:17.161
The child in that room
had very strong abilities.

37:17.163 --> 37:19.931
That child comprehended very quickly

37:19.933 --> 37:21.968
that he had these abilities,

37:21.970 --> 37:24.671
was able to manipulate his environment,

37:24.673 --> 37:29.779
and therefore,
began attracting the other demons to come.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.583
These things are extraordinarily dangerous

37:32.585 --> 37:37.020
and that the older man is very concerned

37:37.022 --> 37:42.131
and feels that they are
here to take... souls.

37:42.133 --> 37:49.003
But their goal, really, is to...
possess him

37:49.005 --> 37:52.944
so that they can

37:52.946 --> 37:57.883
basically be able to function
through him to do harm.

37:57.885 --> 38:01.089
All the things that
have happened to your son,

38:01.091 --> 38:05.128
him getting pushed and thrown,

38:05.130 --> 38:06.963
that would have been from these things?

38:06.965 --> 38:08.601
Yes.

38:10.937 --> 38:12.436
I worry about the baby.

38:12.438 --> 38:14.539
Doesn't make me feel too
good about staying here.

38:14.541 --> 38:15.775
I'll tell you that.

38:19.548 --> 38:22.082
What do we do? That's what we need to know.

38:22.084 --> 38:24.951
What do we do?

38:24.953 --> 38:29.087
I know this is not what
you wanted to hear tonight.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.689
At least you know what's
going on in the house now.

38:30.691 --> 38:32.990
The big question is, though,

38:32.992 --> 38:36.792
can you still stay here
and raise Nathan safely?

38:36.794 --> 38:38.293
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy,

38:38.295 --> 38:39.927
and hopefully,
she'll have an answer for you.

38:41.796 --> 38:46.430
It seems to me that what's
basically going on here

38:46.432 --> 38:50.199
is that this older man is reaching out

38:50.201 --> 38:54.769
because he really feels
like he failed his family,

38:54.771 --> 38:59.241
and I think he wants to protect Nathan

38:59.243 --> 39:02.942
because he sees history repeating itself.

39:02.944 --> 39:04.511
I think that the first thing

39:04.513 --> 39:07.648
that needs to be done immediately

39:07.650 --> 39:13.387
is the contact of a priest
or a demonologist...

39:13.389 --> 39:18.926
someone who can perform
an exorcism on the home

39:18.928 --> 39:20.928
and the property

39:20.930 --> 39:23.997
that is just to be directed towards

39:23.999 --> 39:28.801
the negative demonic
entities that are present.

39:28.803 --> 39:31.138
I want this exorcism

39:31.140 --> 39:38.173
to not incorporate the older man at all,

39:38.175 --> 39:43.045
so that needs to be stated to
the priest or demonologist.

39:43.047 --> 39:46.615
The second thing that needs to
be done as soon as possible...

39:46.617 --> 39:49.784
take Nathan to a child psychologist

39:49.786 --> 39:52.019
for a behavior observation.

39:52.021 --> 39:55.484
Once that's done,
give it about two or three weeks.

39:55.486 --> 39:58.155
Really pay attention to his behavior.

39:58.157 --> 40:01.426
If it improves substantially,
everything's good.

40:01.428 --> 40:03.226
If it does not,

40:03.228 --> 40:07.863
then he, as well,
would need to be, uh, exorcised.

40:11.538 --> 40:15.307
And that would have to be
done <i>only</i> by a priest.

40:17.243 --> 40:18.910
The issue with the older male...

40:18.912 --> 40:22.913
one night, Angie,
I want you to go and lay in your bed.

40:22.915 --> 40:26.781
I want you to ask Clarence to come to you.

40:26.783 --> 40:29.654
Let him know that his work is done,

40:29.656 --> 40:33.223
that he did a good job,
and it's time for him to go.

40:33.225 --> 40:35.928
Concerning the poltergeist phenomenon,

40:35.930 --> 40:40.365
Maggie should take up a physical
but gentle form of exercise,

40:40.367 --> 40:43.202
such as yoga, tai chi, or qigong.

40:43.204 --> 40:47.472
This will help you to learn
how to control your abilities.

40:47.474 --> 40:50.407
It'll also serve as an emotional release.

40:50.409 --> 40:52.142
You guys looked
pretty stunned when she said

40:52.144 --> 40:54.940
the exorcism of the house,
but especially of the baby.

40:54.942 --> 40:57.411
Yeah, I didn't expect that at all.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.078
I didn't, either,
to be honest with you, so...

41:05.655 --> 41:09.424
We'll do what we have to do to protect him.

41:09.426 --> 41:12.363
If, God forbid,
he has to have an exorcism from a priest,

41:12.365 --> 41:14.397
what would he go through?

41:14.399 --> 41:15.999
Would it be simple?

41:16.001 --> 41:19.906
I don't think that it's a full possession,

41:19.908 --> 41:23.543
so it would be fairly quick.

41:23.545 --> 41:28.584
He probably wouldn't even
fully register what's going on.

41:28.586 --> 41:30.252
He'd probably think that this person

41:30.254 --> 41:33.219
was just praying over him,

41:33.221 --> 41:35.788
so I don't think it would be

41:35.790 --> 41:39.421
psychologically damaging in any way.

41:39.423 --> 41:43.391
That's tough advice that she gave you,

41:43.393 --> 41:45.729
and if, God forbid, he needs an exorcism,

41:45.731 --> 41:48.696
- are you gonna go through that?
- Yeah, we have to.

41:48.698 --> 41:53.133
I don't want to, but I will.

41:55.372 --> 41:58.140
There are several dead
people on Angie's property,

41:58.142 --> 42:01.144
but the demons inside
pose the greatest threat.

42:01.146 --> 42:03.349
I believe if they follow my advice,

42:03.351 --> 42:05.383
they will free their home
of the evil within it

42:05.385 --> 42:07.585
and be able to live a peaceful life.
