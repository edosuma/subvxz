- OH, YES, I LOVE
SHERLOCK HOMELY MOVIES.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.502
HE'S SO HOMELY,
HE HAS TO BE SMART.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.038
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THE BUTLER DID IT.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.306
- WHAT BUTLER?

01:13.373 --> 01:14.707
THE MOVIE WAS ABOUT
A GIANT GREEN LIZARD

01:14.774 --> 01:16.309
THAT DESTROYED
POUGHKEEPSIE.

01:16.376 --> 01:19.245
- YOU WANDERED INTO
THE WRONG THEATER AGAIN, DEAR.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.214
- I WANDERED INTO
THE WRONG THEATER, TOO.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.383
THERE WAS HOT OIL
AND POPPING SOUNDS.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.352
- YOU WANDERED INTO
THE POPCORN MACHINE, COSMO.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.755
- OOH, THAT EXPLAINS
THE IMITATION BUTTER FLAVORING

01:28.822 --> 01:29.789
IN MY PANTS.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.791
I CALL IT BUTT BUTTER.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.861
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR HOUSE?

01:37.797 --> 01:38.731
- [high-pitched scream]
EEEEE!

01:38.798 --> 01:40.400
WE'VE BEEN ROBBED!

01:40.467 --> 01:41.935
THEY TOOK EVERYTHING!

01:42.001 --> 01:43.636
OUR FURNITURE, TV...

01:43.703 --> 01:44.904
EVEN THE WALLS!

01:44.971 --> 01:47.407
- IF WE HAD A BUTLER,
I'D BLAME HIM.

01:47.474 --> 01:50.109
- SPARKY, WHY DIDN'T
YOU STOP THE BURGLAR?

01:50.176 --> 01:51.544
- I DIDN'T SEE A BURGLAR.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.713
I WAS TOO BUSY HELPING
THE MOVER WITH THE SKI MASK

01:53.780 --> 01:55.882
LOAD ALL OF YOUR STUFF
INTO HIS UNMARKED VAN.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.350
- THAT WAS THE BURGLAR!

01:57.417 --> 01:59.185
- OH, SORRY, TIMMY.

01:59.252 --> 02:00.353
I THOUGHT WE WERE MOVING
SOMEWHERE BETTER

02:00.420 --> 02:01.554
THAN THIS DUMP.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.423
THIS PLACE DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE WALLS.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.058
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA
REPORTING

02:05.124 --> 02:07.660
THAT A BURGLAR HAS BEEN ROBBING
HOUSES ALL OVER DIMMSDALE,

02:07.727 --> 02:10.497
TAKING EVERYTHING INCLUDING
MY MICROPHONE,

02:10.562 --> 02:12.532
WHICH IS WHY I'M TALKING
INTO THIS CHURRO.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.533
THIS JUST IN--

02:13.600 --> 02:16.035
IT'S A MEXICAN DOUGHNUT.

02:16.102 --> 02:18.204
- HEY, TURNERS,
I SAW YOU WERE ROBBED,

02:18.271 --> 02:19.639
SO I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF REPLACING

02:19.706 --> 02:21.174
ALL YOUR WORLDLY POSSESSIONS.

02:21.241 --> 02:24.143
I ALSO BROUGHT YOU
THIS SACK OF COLD, HARD CASH.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.446
- COLD AND HARD
LIKE YOUR HEART!

02:26.513 --> 02:29.215
GET OFF MY LAWN,
YOU DEMON WITH A HUMAN FACE!

02:29.282 --> 02:31.217
- I'M GLAD THE HOUSE
IS BACK TO NORMAL.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.852
AND IT'S A GOOD THING
MR. DINKLEBERG

02:32.919 --> 02:35.054
GOT EXACT REPLICAS
OF ALL MY OLD STUFF.

02:35.121 --> 02:37.423
WE CAN FORGET THE BURGLARY
EVER HAPPENED.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.825
- OH, TIMMY.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.461
WE CAN NEVER FORGET
THIS BURGLARY EVER HAPPENED!

02:41.528 --> 02:42.695
TO CATCH THE BURGLAR,

02:42.762 --> 02:43.863
I'M STARTING
A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.064
DARN IT!

02:45.131 --> 02:46.199
HE TOOK MY WATCH!

02:46.266 --> 02:48.768
THIS GUY IS MORE CUNNING
THAN I THOUGHT.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.703
- DAD, YOU DON'T WEAR A WATCH.

02:50.770 --> 02:51.871
- GOOD DETECTIVE WORK, SON.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.506
I COULD USE YOU ON MY TEAM.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.108
- DAD, YOU'RE NOT
A DETECTIVE.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.509
- I MIGHT AS WELL BE.

02:56.576 --> 02:59.145
I'VE SEEN EVERY
SHERLOCK HOMELY MOVIE EVER MADE.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.214
WELL, EXCEPT FOR THE ONE
WE JUST CAME BACK FROM.

03:01.281 --> 03:03.449
ANYWAY, I'M CALLING
A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH MEETING

03:03.516 --> 03:05.385
IN OUR LIVING ROOM.

03:05.451 --> 03:07.253
- DAD, I DON'T THINK
ANYONE ELSE

03:07.320 --> 03:10.390
WANTS TO JOIN
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

03:10.456 --> 03:11.925
- THAT'S BECAUSE
THE BURGLAR STOLE

03:11.991 --> 03:13.226
THEIR SENSE OF JUSTICE!

03:13.293 --> 03:14.527
- HELLO,
I'M HERE TO JOIN

03:14.594 --> 03:16.162
YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PROGRAM.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.797
- WERE YOU ROBBED TOO,
MR. CROCKER?

03:17.864 --> 03:20.199
- NO, I'M HERE 'CAUSE
I WANNA CHEW THE BURGLAR OUT

03:20.266 --> 03:21.568
FOR NOT TAKING MOTHER.

03:21.634 --> 03:23.102
I LEFT HER ON THE PORCH
WITH A NOTE THAT SAID

03:23.169 --> 03:25.471
"PLEASE STEAL ME,"
BUT NO DICE!

03:25.538 --> 03:27.640
HE DID, HOWEVER, TAKE MY DICE.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.876
- WELL,
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL HERE,

03:29.943 --> 03:32.178
I'M GONNA PULL OUT
MY OFFICIAL DETECTIVE CASE.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.413
EH, LET'S SEE...

03:41.521 --> 03:44.324
AS DETECTIVES, WE'LL NEED
A NAME THAT WILL STRIKE FEAR

03:44.390 --> 03:46.025
INTO EVERY CRIMINAL OUT THERE.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.293
WE'LL CALL OURSELVES

03:47.360 --> 03:50.096
THE DIMMSDALE UNDERCOVER
CRIME KILLER SQUAD.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.098
- SO, WE'RE THE DUCKS?

03:52.165 --> 03:53.499
- OF COURSE WE ARE.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.734
NOTHING PUTS MORE FEAR

03:54.801 --> 03:56.569
INTO THE HEART OF THIEVES
THAN DUCK HATS.

03:56.636 --> 03:57.837
I STOLE THEM FROM DINKLEBERG,

03:57.904 --> 03:59.839
SO TECHNICALLY,
I'M OUR FIRST SUSPECT.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.575
FROM NOW ON, YOU
WILL CALL ME BY MY CODE NAME--

04:02.642 --> 04:03.676
MAJOR MALLARD.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.878
YOUR CODE NAME IS
LUCY GOOSEY.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.113
- OH, COME ON!

04:07.180 --> 04:09.649
- AND YOUR CODE NAME
IS MR. QUACKERS.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.451
- COULD I BE NAMED
THE FALCON?

04:11.517 --> 04:13.586
IT'S A COOL NAME,
AND IT MIGHT GET ME A DATE.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.822
- FALCONS HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH CRIME.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.491
EVERYONE KNOWS DUCKS
ARE NATURE'S CRIME FIGHTERS.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.692
THEY FLY SOUTH FOR
THE WINTER TO BUST PERPS.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.262
NOW TO CATCH A BURGLAR
IN THE ACT,

04:22.328 --> 04:24.564
WE'LL HAVE TO SET UP
A STAKEOUT.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.432
MMM, I LOVE STEAK OUTS!

04:26.499 --> 04:28.034
ESPECIALLY
WITH CREAMED CORN.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.436
OH, I LOVE CREAMED CORN,
TIMMY.

04:30.503 --> 04:31.804
- I DON'T THINK
A STAKEOUT MEANS

04:31.871 --> 04:33.072
GOING OUT FOR STEAK.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.607
- I WORKED AT
A STEAKHOUSE ONCE,

04:34.674 --> 04:35.908
JUST TO STEAL THE KNIVES.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.143
THAT REMINDS ME--

04:37.210 --> 04:38.378
I HAVE TO LEAVE SOON
TO PUT MOTHER OUT

04:38.444 --> 04:39.545
FOR THE BURGLAR WITH
A NOTE THAT SAYS,

04:39.612 --> 04:41.381
"GREAT FOR PULLING
YOUR PLOW."

04:41.447 --> 04:43.683
THAT WOMAN'S GOT
THE CANKLES OF A CLYDESDALE.

04:46.653 --> 04:50.390
[all chewing noisily]

04:50.456 --> 04:52.392
[cash register bell dings]

04:57.363 --> 04:59.132
- THIS STEAK OUT
IS DELICIOUS.

04:59.198 --> 05:00.733
ONCE WE'RE DONE,
WE SHOULD REALLY START

05:00.800 --> 05:01.868
LOOKING FOR THE BURGLAR.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.170
EXCUSE ME, WAITER,

05:04.237 --> 05:06.239
COULD I GET
A DOGGY BAG, PLEASE?

05:06.305 --> 05:08.274
- SORRY, NOT MY TABLE.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.309
[laughs wickedly]

05:10.376 --> 05:12.378
- DAD, I THINK THAT WAS
THE BURGLAR.

05:12.445 --> 05:13.513
- WHAT?

05:13.579 --> 05:15.181
TO THE DUCK TRUCK,
MR. QUACKERS!

05:15.248 --> 05:16.449
YOU TOO, LUCY GOOSEY.

05:16.516 --> 05:17.617
- OH, COME ON!

05:17.684 --> 05:18.651
[fanfare]

05:18.718 --> 05:20.520
- FLOOR IT, MR. QUACKERS.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.121
- IT'S THE FALCON!

05:22.188 --> 05:24.023
- NO, IT'S NOT!

05:24.090 --> 05:25.858
[screams]

05:25.925 --> 05:27.794
IT'S THE BURGLAR.

05:27.860 --> 05:28.795

05:28.861 --> 05:29.796
[quaaaack]

05:29.862 --> 05:30.797
[ducks quacking]

05:30.863 --> 05:32.165
ARREST HIM!

05:32.231 --> 05:34.467
- THAT'S JUST
A GUY TAKING OUT HIS TRASH.

05:34.534 --> 05:35.468
[ducks quacking]

05:35.535 --> 05:36.469
[tires screeching,
crash]

05:36.536 --> 05:38.137
- TRUST ME, LUCY GOOSEY.

05:38.204 --> 05:39.872
I HAVE THE MIND
OF A DEFECTIVE.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.107
- I THINK YOU MEAN DETECTIVE.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.875
- [yelping]
[crash]

05:42.942 --> 05:45.044
- NO, I THINK HE HAD IT
RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.512
[ducks quack]

05:46.579 --> 05:48.114
- AAH!

05:48.181 --> 05:49.615
[quaaaack]

05:49.682 --> 05:52.752
LOOK, SOMEONE'S IN
OLD LADY SCHWIMMER'S HOUSE.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.420
- THAT'S MRS. SCHWIMMER, DAD.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.222
- WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT THE BURGLAR

05:56.289 --> 05:58.024
WOULD WANT US
TO THINK.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.025
[crash]
- EH?

05:59.092 --> 06:00.493
- YOU'RE BUSTED, BURGLAR!

06:00.560 --> 06:01.794
WE'RE THE DUCKS.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.795
- I'M THE FALCON.

06:02.862 --> 06:03.796
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LATER?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.298
- SHUT YOUR BEAK, MR. QUACKERS,

06:05.364 --> 06:07.200
AND PAT THE SUSPECT DOWN
FOR STOLEN LOOT

06:07.266 --> 06:10.336
WHILE WE GO FOR MORE STEAK.

06:10.403 --> 06:11.437
- [screams]

06:11.504 --> 06:13.873
- GAH!

06:13.940 --> 06:16.275
WHY AM I ALWAYS STUCK
WITH AN OLD LADY?

06:16.342 --> 06:19.078
I SWEAR, I ATTRACT THEM
LIKE A FREE BUS TO RENO.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.446
EEYAH!

06:20.513 --> 06:22.014
- [screams]

06:22.081 --> 06:24.784
[ducks quacking]

06:24.851 --> 06:27.053
- AFTER MUCH THOROUGH
AND HANDSOME INVESTIGATING

06:27.120 --> 06:28.354
IN THIS DUCK HAT,

06:28.421 --> 06:30.156
I'VE CONCLUDED
THAT THE BURGLAR IS

06:30.223 --> 06:32.225
NONE OTHER THAN...

06:32.291 --> 06:33.993
DINKLEBERG.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.628
- MR. DINKLEBERG'S CLEAN.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.430
NOTHING WE FOUND
LEADS TO HIM.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.065
- OH, REALLY?

06:39.132 --> 06:41.434
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THESE STOLEN DUCK HATS?

06:41.501 --> 06:43.703
- YOU STOLE THEM FROM HIM,
DAD.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.439
- IT'S MAJOR MALLARD,
AND STOP TWISTING MY WORDS.

06:46.506 --> 06:50.376
I WILL NOT BE A VICTIM
OF THIS WITCH HUNT.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.111
- GUYS, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MY DAD.

06:52.178 --> 06:55.081
ALL HIS CRAZY DETECTIVE WORK
IS GONNA GET HIM INTO TROUBLE.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.449
- I WOULDN'T WORRY, TIMMY.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.184
YOU REALLY THINK PEOPLE
ARE DUMB ENOUGH

06:58.251 --> 07:00.253
TO BELIEVE HIS CRAZY THEORIES?

07:01.654 --> 07:03.756
- SO IT IS DINKLEBERG!

07:03.823 --> 07:05.658
THE FALCON IS GONNA GO ASK
THAT LUNATIC

07:05.725 --> 07:08.561
WHY HE DIDN'T STEAL MOTHER.

07:08.628 --> 07:09.595
[indistinct shouting]

07:09.662 --> 07:11.063
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA REPORTING

07:11.130 --> 07:13.366
THAT TIMMY TURNER'S DAD
HAS HARASSED HALF THE TOWN,

07:13.432 --> 07:14.901
CAUSING AN ANGRY MOB
TO DEMAND

07:14.967 --> 07:17.103
THAT THE TURNERS
LEAVE DIMMSDALE FOREVER.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.871
IN RELATED NEWS,
THE ANGRY MOB

07:18.938 --> 07:20.306
WOULD'VE BROUGHT PITCHFORKS
AND TORCHES,

07:20.373 --> 07:22.208
BUT THOSE WERE STOLEN TOO.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.376
- WHOA.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.644
I HAVEN'T SEEN A MOB
THIS ANGRY

07:24.710 --> 07:25.778
SINCE THEY RAN OUT
OF POWDERED DOUGHNUTS

07:25.845 --> 07:27.013
AT PARENT/TEACHER NIGHT.

07:27.079 --> 07:28.581
WELL, I'M OUT OF HERE.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.617
TIME FOR THE FALCON
TO TAKE TO THE SKY!

07:31.684 --> 07:34.153
GREAT, THE BURGLAR STOLE
THE DUCK TRUCK.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.421
GET TURNER!

07:35.488 --> 07:36.489
[ducks quacking]

07:36.556 --> 07:38.491

07:38.558 --> 07:39.725
OH, NO.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.427
EVEN THE DUCKS
HAVE TURNED AGAINST ME.

07:41.494 --> 07:42.562
NO, I'M WRONG.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.330
I JUST HAVE CREAMED CORN
ON MY SHOES.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.065
[all chanting]

07:46.132 --> 07:47.967

I'VE FAILED, TIMMY.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.505
EVERY HOUSE IN DIMMSDALE
WAS ROBBED,

07:52.572 --> 07:53.906
AND I COULDN'T STOP IT.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.308
I'M NOT FIT TO WEAR

07:55.374 --> 07:57.577
THIS EXTREMELY FLATTERING
DUCK HAT.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.878
LET'S GO PACK OUR THINGS,

07:58.945 --> 08:00.513
SO WE CAN LEAVE
THIS TOWN FOREVER.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.348
WE'LL PICK UP SOME STEAKS
ON THE WAY OUT.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.350
- I'M NOT HUNGRY.
I ATE A DUCK.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.786
[duck quacks]
ANYWAY, LET'S BLOW THIS JOINT.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.788
- NO, SPARKY.
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.456
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO HELP DAD

08:10.523 --> 08:12.892
CATCH THIS BURGLAR
AND SAVE HIS REPUTATION.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.360
- BUT HOW, SPORT?

08:14.427 --> 08:17.263
EVERY HOUSE IN DIMMSDALE
HAS ALREADY BEEN ROBBED.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.166
- THEN I WISH DIMMSDALE
HAD ONE MORE HOUSE.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.438
- WELL, TIMMY, LOOKS LIKE
I'M BEING DRIVEN OUT OF TOWN

08:25.504 --> 08:26.739
BY AN ANGRY MOB.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.207
STORY OF MY LIFE.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.543
- DAD, YOU CANNOT GIVE UP
ON THE DUCKS.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.912
THERE'S STILL ONE MORE HOUSE
THAT HASN'T BEEN ROBBED.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.014
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TRAP
THE BURGLAR THERE.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.049
- I'VE NEVER NOTICED
THAT HOUSE BEFORE.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.619
BUT I THINK WE'VE REALIZED THAT
I DON'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.289
[ducks quacking]

08:43.356 --> 08:44.891
- THIS IS
THE ONLY HOUSE LEFT

08:44.957 --> 08:46.192
FOR THE BURGLAR TO ROB, DAD.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.393
AND WHEN HE SHOWS UP,

08:47.460 --> 08:48.928
YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE
TO STOP HIM.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.196
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.998
AND WHEN I DO,
I'LL PROVE TO EVERYONE

08:52.064 --> 08:53.900
THAT THEY WERE WRONG
ABOUT ME.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.534
[both blow duck call]

08:55.601 --> 08:57.436
LET'S DO THIS,
LUCY GOOSEY!

08:57.503 --> 08:59.605
- YOU GOT IT, MAJOR MALLARD!

08:59.672 --> 09:00.606
- IT'S DAD.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.608
OH, RIGHT.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.246
- HELLO, NEIGHBORS.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.081
WE'RE
THE SUPER RICH FAIRYMANS.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.783
CARE FOR A FANCY EGG?

09:10.850 --> 09:11.884
- THANK YOU.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.352
I GOTTA SAY, MR. FAIRYMAN,

09:13.419 --> 09:15.488
I LIKE YOUR GREEN HAIR.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.590
I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE RICH
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.992
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE SUPER RICH!

09:20.059 --> 09:21.294
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

09:21.360 --> 09:25.598
I HAVE TO LEAVE
MY GOLD OUT TO DRY.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.166
- OH, LOOK, HONEY.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.734
THE DIAMONDS ARE RIPE.

09:28.801 --> 09:32.271
- THOSE WILL GO GREAT
IN YOUR DIAMOND MANGO SALAD.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.873
WON'T YOU STAY FOR DINNER?

09:33.940 --> 09:35.074
- SURE.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.876
TIMMY, IT'S GONNA BE HARD
FOR ME

09:36.943 --> 09:39.545
NOT TO ROB THESE PEOPLE.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.914
- OH, DON'T BOTHER
CLOSING THE DOOR.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.784
WE RICH PEOPLE FIND IT
TO BE SUCH A HASSLE.

09:44.850 --> 09:45.952
[duck squawks]

09:46.018 --> 09:47.853
- I'M GONNA DUST
FOR FINGERPAINTS.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.288
- FINGERPRINTS, DAD.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.223
[coughs]

09:51.290 --> 09:53.926
- DUST!

09:53.993 --> 09:54.994
DUST!

09:59.999 --> 10:02.368
- UH, DAD, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO DUST FOR FINGERPRINTS

10:02.435 --> 10:04.670
AND BLOCK OFF THE CRIME SCENE
AFTER A CRIME?

10:04.737 --> 10:06.839
- TIMMY, I'M THE DEFECTIVE HERE.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.342
- YOU SURE ARE.

10:09.408 --> 10:10.876
all: AAH!

10:10.943 --> 10:12.645
- OH, NO!
IT'S THE WAITER!

10:12.712 --> 10:14.280
- DAD, IT'S THE BURGLAR!

10:14.347 --> 10:15.781
- AND HE'S GOT OUR WANDS!

10:15.848 --> 10:19.385
I MEAN, OUR VERY
EXPENSIVE SALAD TONGS!

10:19.452 --> 10:21.787
- THANKS TO YOUR
LOSER NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH,

10:21.854 --> 10:24.957
ROBBING THIS TOWN HAS BEEN
A PIECE OF CAKE.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.460
I'M JUST GONNA STEAL
THIS ONE LAST THING

10:27.526 --> 10:29.628
BEFORE I GO HAVE
A PIECE OF CAKE.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.564
[laughs]

10:31.630 --> 10:34.033
- AAH!
LISTEN UP, BURGLAR.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.202
YOU CAN ROB MY HOUSE
AND HUMILIATE ME

10:36.268 --> 10:37.603
IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE TOWN,

10:37.670 --> 10:40.840
BUT NOBODY STEALS MY DUCK CALL!

10:40.906 --> 10:42.241
- AH-CHOO!

10:44.410 --> 10:46.779
- DAD, YOUR SUPER-WEIRD
DETECTIVE SKILLS

10:46.846 --> 10:48.247
ACTUALLY PAID OFF!

10:48.314 --> 10:51.150
- THAT'S BECAUSE GOOD
ALWAYS TRIUMPHS OVER EVIL.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.518
NOW GRAB THE DIAMONDS
OUT OF THAT SALAD

10:52.585 --> 10:53.686
AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

10:53.753 --> 10:54.887
[indistinct shouting]

10:54.954 --> 10:57.156
HERE'S YOUR BURGLAR,
DIMMSDALE!

10:57.223 --> 10:59.892
WE CAN ALL REST EASY
NOW THAT THE STREETS ARE SAFE.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.260
I KNOW I WILL.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.696
ALL THAT CREAMED CORN
MADE ME REALLY SLEEPY.

11:03.763 --> 11:09.702
[all cheering]

11:09.769 --> 11:12.605
[ducks quacking]

11:15.674 --> 11:18.277
- WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
MRS. FAIRYMAN.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.379
- GREAT. THANK YOU.

11:20.446 --> 11:22.615
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH 800 MEATLOAVES?

11:22.681 --> 11:24.183
- WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY--

11:24.250 --> 11:26.852
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU MEATLOAF,
MAKE LEMONADE.

11:26.919 --> 11:27.987
[gulps]

11:28.054 --> 11:31.624
BOY, THIS IS
DISGUSTING LEMONADE.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.160
- I'M THE FALCON!
CALL ME.

11:48.941 --> 11:50.709
[vacuum hums]

11:50.776 --> 11:52.578
- THIS IS THE WORST DAY EVER!

11:52.645 --> 11:54.680
I WAS GOING
THROUGH DINKLEBERG'S MAIL,

11:54.747 --> 11:57.183
AND I FOUND THIS.
- A MONOGRAMMED SWEATER?

11:57.249 --> 11:59.485
- NO, I TOOK THE SWEATER
FROM DINKLEBERG'S CLOSET.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.220
THE "D" STANDS FOR DAD NOW.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.490
I MEANT THIS COPY OF
<i>PERFECT FAMILY MAGAZINE.</i>

12:04.557 --> 12:06.992
EVERY WEEK THEY GIVE
THE PERFECT FAMILY AWARD

12:07.059 --> 12:08.360
TO THE DINKLEBERGS!

12:08.427 --> 12:11.063
WHY NOT US?
WE'RE THE DEFINITION OF PERFECT.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.466
YOU'RE THE PERFECT HOMEMAKER.

12:13.532 --> 12:15.434
boom!

12:15.501 --> 12:16.502
- OH, DEAR.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.070
THE SUCKY-UPPY THINGY
BROKE.

12:18.137 --> 12:21.006
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
I'M DONE WITH MY CHORES.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.975
- AND TIMMY'S
THE PERFECT STUDENT.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.376
- I AM.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.445
THE "F" ON MY BOOK REPORT
STANDS FOR FANTASTIC.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.681
- AND SPARKY'S THE PERFECT DOG.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.850
- DOG FOOD?
OH, COME ON!

12:30.916 --> 12:34.153
I ASKED FOR
SURF AND TURF.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.088
- PERFECT KICK, SPARKY.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.691
HONESTLY, WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT THE DINKLEBERGS?

12:38.757 --> 12:41.026
SURE, THEY TURNED
THEIR POOL INTO A SANCTUARY

12:41.093 --> 12:43.095
FOR ENDANGERED SEA TURTLES,

12:43.162 --> 12:44.964
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
MAKE DELICIOUS SOUP.

12:45.030 --> 12:45.965
[slurps]

12:46.031 --> 12:47.333
WHO AM I KIDDING?

12:47.399 --> 12:49.502
THE DINKLEBERGS
ARE BETTER THAN US.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.470
[sobs]

12:51.537 --> 12:52.805
- NO, THEY'RE NOT, DAD.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.440
WE HAVE A MUCH NICER...

12:54.507 --> 12:55.708
UH, TABLECLOTH.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.643
- I STOLE THAT FROM
THE DINKLEBERG TOO!

12:57.710 --> 12:59.278
THAT'S WHY IT HAS "Ds" ON IT.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.247
- I THOUGHT THAT STOOD
FOR DINNER.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.949
- I'M GONNA GO UP
TO MY LESS-THAN-PERFECT ROOM

13:04.016 --> 13:06.452
AND CRY INTO
MY LESS-THAN-PERFECT PILLOW.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.220
[sobs]

13:08.287 --> 13:09.788
- I'LL COME WITH YOU, DEAR.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.724
IT'S FILTHY DOWN HERE.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.593
- I FEEL TERRIBLE
FOR MY DAD, GUYS.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.129
HE REALLY WANTS US TO BE
THE PERFECT FAMILY.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.231
- YOU KNOW WHAT PERFECTION IS,
TIMMY?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.400
BEING EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.736
- YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW
TIMMY VERY WELL,

13:23.802 --> 13:24.904
BUT ON A RELATED NOTE,

13:24.970 --> 13:26.705
I DON'T KNOW ME
VERY WELL EITHER.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.141
I HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO I AM.

13:29.208 --> 13:32.178
OKAY, I AM DEFINITELY
NOT A LION TAMER,

13:32.244 --> 13:34.914
BUT I DEFINITELY AM A GUY
WITH INTERNAL BLEEDING.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.217
I'M UNRAVELING
THE MYSTERY THAT IS ME.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.886
- WANDA, I REALLY WANT
TO MAKE MY DAD HAPPY.

13:40.953 --> 13:42.621
I WISH WE WERE
THE PERFECT FAMILY,

13:42.688 --> 13:45.090
SO WE CAN WIN
THE PERFECT FAMILY AWARD.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.735
WHOA!
I'M TALLER...

13:56.802 --> 14:00.139
WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TEETH
FOR A PERSON.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.273
- TURNER,

14:01.340 --> 14:03.509
YOUR HOMEWORK MAGICALLY
REGRADED ITSELF.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.044
NOW YOU'RE
THE PERFECT STUDENT.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.346
THIS CAN ONLY BE
THE WORK OF FAIRIES!

14:07.413 --> 14:09.281
WHO I ASSUME
ARE CLEVERLY DISGUISED

14:09.348 --> 14:10.883
AS THOSE TWO SKUNKS
ON YOUR LAWN.

14:12.651 --> 14:13.686
HOORAY!

14:13.752 --> 14:15.321
THEY SPRAYED ME
WITH THEIR MAGIC.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.655
[sniffs]
HMM.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.591
I DON'T REMEMBER MAGIC
SMELLING THIS BAD.

14:20.626 --> 14:21.694
LOOK AT THAT.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.829
I HAVE THE POWER
TO WILT DAFFODILS.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.898
DENZEL CROCKER
IS A STINKY FORCE

14:25.965 --> 14:27.333
TO BE RECKONED WITH!

14:27.399 --> 14:30.336
- TIMMY, I MADE THESE
PERFECT FINGER SANDWICHES.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.204
WHICH IS AMAZING,
BECAUSE A MINUTE AGO,

14:32.271 --> 14:34.506
I WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR
WITH SMOKING PIECES

14:34.573 --> 14:37.610
OF THE MICROWAVE BURNING
THROUGH MY DIRTY SWEAT PANTS.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.378
- THEY'RE JUST
LIKE I LIKE 'EM, MOM,

14:39.445 --> 14:40.879
WITH THE CRUSTS CUT OFF.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.514
[chomps]

14:42.581 --> 14:45.417
- I USED THE CRUSTS
TO FEED THESE SONGBIRDS.

14:45.484 --> 14:46.452
[birds tweeting]

14:46.518 --> 14:48.721
- I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.122
AND BY THAT I MEAN
I SUDDENLY DON'T HAVE

14:50.189 --> 14:52.057
TO WEAR CONTACT LENSES
ANYMORE.

14:52.124 --> 14:54.059
ALSO, MY FAMILY IS PERFECT.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.561
[heavenly choir sings]

14:55.628 --> 14:56.962
EVEN SPARKY,

14:57.029 --> 14:58.831
WHO'S TURNED INTO
A HANDSOME WHITE STALLION.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.033
- MY NAME IS AVALANCHE NOW!

15:01.100 --> 15:03.302
- [gasps]
HE'S SO PERFECT HE TALKS.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.037
[doorbell rings]

15:05.104 --> 15:07.706
- HI, I'M SUSAN PERCRITICAL.

15:07.773 --> 15:10.142
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME
SUE PERCRITICAL.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.677
I'M FROM
<i>PERFECT FAMILY MAGAZINE,</i>

15:11.744 --> 15:13.212
AND I RECEIVED A TIP
THAT YOU'RE

15:13.279 --> 15:15.514
THE MOST PERFECT FAMILY
IN DIMMSDALE.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.083
- WELL, OUR DOG IS A HORSE.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.285
- THAT'S A GOOD START.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.487
AND YOU DO LOOK
FAIRLY FLAWLESS.

15:21.553 --> 15:25.090
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
REMAIN PERFECT FOR 24 HOURS,

15:25.157 --> 15:26.692
AND THE TROPHY IS YOURS.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.394
- COME ON, SUE PERCRITICAL.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.362
WE'LL GIVE YOU A TOUR OF
OUR PERFECT HOUSE.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.564
- I CUT THE CRUSTS OFF
THE DEN.

15:32.631 --> 15:35.701
- WELL, I'M DEFINITELY
NOT A CRASH TEST DUMMY.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.936
- WELL, YOU ARE ONE
OF THOSE WORDS.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.906
- MY VISION QUEST CONTINUES.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.108
- SPORT, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR DAD IS ON HIS WAY

15:43.175 --> 15:44.476
TO GETTING THAT TROPHY.

15:44.543 --> 15:46.812
- BEING PERFECT
IS GONNA BE A SNAP!

15:46.879 --> 15:48.314
I'M GONNA SNAP!

15:48.380 --> 15:51.150
I DIDN'T REALIZE PERFECT KIDS
DID THIS MUCH HOMEWORK.

15:51.216 --> 15:54.820
- AND THEY ALSO EAT SIX SERVINGS
OF VEGETABLES A DAY.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.022
- OH, COME ON!

15:57.089 --> 15:58.891
[chews]

15:58.957 --> 16:02.061
- WELL, APPARENTLY I'M NOT
A MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT EITHER.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.163
ALSO, I DON'T THINK THAT GUY
IN THE ALLEY

16:04.229 --> 16:07.232
WITH THE RUSTY SAW
WAS REALLY A MAGICIAN.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.568
- BEING PERFECT
IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.904
- BEING PERFECT IS HARD!

16:11.970 --> 16:13.939
NOW I HAVE TO DO THINGS
LIKE MOW THE LAWN,

16:14.006 --> 16:15.641
RAKE THE LEAVES,

16:15.708 --> 16:18.911
AND GIVE DINKLEBERG BACK
ALL THE STUFF I STOLE.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.680
- TURNER, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO RETURN ALL MY STUFF.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.248
- OH, I HAD NO CHOICE.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.817
I'M CURSED WITH PERFECTION.

16:24.883 --> 16:27.419
BUT I AM KEEPING
YOUR WATCH.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.588
[sobs]
OH, NO, I'M NOT.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.424
- I'M NOT SURE I'M CUT OUT
FOR THIS PERFECT THING.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.259
NOW I HAVE TO BUY OUR GROCERIES

16:34.326 --> 16:37.329
INSTEAD OF TAKING FOOD
FROM BAR MITZVAH RECEPTIONS.

16:37.396 --> 16:40.699
- SO I GUESS WE'RE NOT HAVING
A CHOPPED LIVER SWAN FOR DINNER?

16:40.766 --> 16:42.234
- OH, NO, DEAR.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.603
WE'RE HAVING A HEALTHY
AND LEGALLY PURCHASED MEAL.

16:44.670 --> 16:48.006
SO I'M MAKING STEAMED FISH
AND SIX SERVINGS OF VEGETABLES.

16:48.073 --> 16:49.141
- THAT'S IT!

16:49.208 --> 16:51.009
EMERGENCY FAMILY MEETING
IN THE KITCHEN.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.178
TURNERS ASSEMBLE!

16:53.245 --> 16:54.947
[blows]

16:55.013 --> 16:57.583
BY THE WAY, DINKLEBERG,
HERE'S YOUR CONCH SHELL.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.353
LOOK, I KNOW WE ALL WANT
THAT TROPHY.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.589
OR AT LEAST I DO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.457
THE POINT IS,
BEING PERFECT IS KILLING US.

17:05.523 --> 17:06.724
AND BY US, I MEAN ME.

17:06.791 --> 17:07.859
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S KILLING YOU.

17:07.925 --> 17:08.961
- YOU'RE RIGHT, DAD.

17:09.027 --> 17:10.561
BEING PERFECT IS THE WORST.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.397
[bird twittering]

17:12.464 --> 17:15.867
STOP SINGING IN MY EAR,
STUPID BIRD!

17:15.934 --> 17:17.202
- LOOK, I HAVE A PLAN.

17:17.269 --> 17:19.171
WE CAN STILL WIN THE TROPHY
IF WE'RE PERFECT

17:19.238 --> 17:20.705
WHEN THE JUDGE GETS HERE
TOMORROW.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.974
BUT UNTIL THEN,
I SAY WE SECRETLY GO BACK

17:23.040 --> 17:25.042
TO BEING OUR
IMPERFECT SELVES.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.412
both: WHOO-HOO!

17:26.478 --> 17:29.415
LET'S LOSE
THE PERFECT CLOTHES!

17:33.152 --> 17:34.386
- THAT'S STRANGE.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.355
WELL, THERE ARE
OTHER WAYS TO NOT BE PERFECT.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.690
I'M GONNA CALL MY BOSS,
MR. ED LEADLY,

17:38.757 --> 17:41.293
AND LIE ABOUT BEING TOO SICK
TO WORK ON MONDAY.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.195
HELLO, MR. ED LEADLY.

17:43.262 --> 17:44.563
I'M SICK...

17:44.630 --> 17:46.331
OF NOT WORKING,
AND I CAN'T WAIT

17:46.398 --> 17:48.000
TO COME IN ON MONDAY.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.535
[high-pitched scream]

17:49.601 --> 17:50.969
IT'S LIKE MY VOICE
STAYED PERFECT

17:51.036 --> 17:52.438
EVEN THOUGH MY BRAIN
DIDN'T WANT TO BE.

17:52.504 --> 17:53.505
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

17:53.572 --> 17:54.540
- I DON'T KNOW, DEAR.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.175
BUT SOMETHING'S WRONG.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.776
I TRIED TO MAKE OUR
USUAL DINNER

17:57.843 --> 17:59.411
OF HOT FUDGE SUNDAES,
BUT THEY TURNED

17:59.478 --> 18:01.947
INTO SALMON
WITH STEAMED BROCCOLI.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.149
- WE'RE LIVING IN
A PERFECT NIGHTMARE!

18:04.216 --> 18:07.619
[both screaming]

18:07.686 --> 18:10.022
- WANDA, WE CAN'T STOP
BEING PERFECT,

18:10.088 --> 18:11.490
AND IT'S MAKING US CRAZY.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.425
YOU HAVE TO UNDO THE WISH.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.427
- I CAN'T, TIMMY.
YOU WISHED TO BE PERFECT

18:15.494 --> 18:17.095
SO YOUR DAD
COULD WIN THE AWARD,

18:17.162 --> 18:18.764
AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

18:18.831 --> 18:22.100
SO YOU'RE STUCK WITH BEING
PERFECT UNTIL TOMORROW.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.870
- WELL, I'M ALSO NOT
A SWORD SWALLOWER.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.839
MAYBE I'M A RATTLESNAKE
WHISPERER.

18:26.905 --> 18:29.875
HI, MR. RATTLESNAKE.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.810
WRONG AGAIN!

18:31.877 --> 18:33.278
- THIS IS NUTS!

18:33.345 --> 18:35.981
I CAN'T TAKE BEING PERFECT
FOR ANOTHER 12 HOURS.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.317
- SORRY.
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.819
- OH, REALLY?
WELL, CHECK THIS OUT.

18:40.886 --> 18:43.755
I'M GONNA WATCH TV INSTEAD
OF DOING MY HOMEWORK.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.892
MATH?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.293
AAH!

18:48.360 --> 18:49.962
- TIMMY, IT'S BEDTIME.

18:50.028 --> 18:51.530
- IT'S ONLY 9:00.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.265
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GOING TO--

18:53.332 --> 18:54.266
WHAT THE--

18:54.333 --> 18:55.601
MY LEGS ARE TAKING ME TO BED

18:55.667 --> 18:57.202
EVEN THOUGH MY BRAIN
DOESN'T WANT TO GO.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.537
AAH!

18:58.604 --> 19:01.306
I MIGHT BE IN BED,
BUT THERE IS NO WAY

19:01.373 --> 19:05.677
I'M GOING TO SL--
[snores]

19:05.744 --> 19:07.112
- LOOK, TIMMY.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.014
I MADE
THE PERFECT BREAKFAST.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.484
I COULDN'T--[sobs]
STOP MYSELF.

19:12.551 --> 19:16.188
MY BODY GOT UP AT 5:00 A.M.
TO START COOKING!

19:16.255 --> 19:17.756
[crying]

19:19.358 --> 19:23.362
- FRUIT, PLAIN YOGURT,
WHEAT TOAST WITH NO BUTTER?

19:23.428 --> 19:25.631
WHAT IS THIS,
A HIPPIE LABOR CAMP?

19:25.697 --> 19:28.634
FORGET IT,
I'M HAVING SUGARY CEREAL.

19:31.403 --> 19:32.638
AAH!

19:32.704 --> 19:33.705
- HEY, GUYS.

19:33.772 --> 19:34.806
CAN'T STAY FOR BREAKFAST.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.475
I'M IN
THE DIMMSDALE DERBY.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.809
- BREAK A LEG, SPARKY!

19:37.876 --> 19:39.044
- IT'S AVALANCHE.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.413
AND NEVER SAY THAT
TO A HORSE!

19:42.581 --> 19:43.682
[neighs]

19:43.749 --> 19:45.551
- MORNING!
I'M GONNA GET THE PAPER

19:45.617 --> 19:47.586
AND HACK APART
DINKLEBERG'S GAZEBO.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.023
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE!

19:51.089 --> 19:52.624
I TRIED TO HACK APART
HIS GAZEBO

19:52.691 --> 19:54.126
AND ENDED UP BUILDING HIM
A NEW FAMILY ROOM

19:54.192 --> 19:56.495
WITH A STUNNING BAY WINDOW.
- HEY, TURNER.

19:56.562 --> 19:57.563
JUST REMINDING YOU,

19:57.629 --> 19:58.564
WHEN YOU BUILT
MY FAMILY ROOM

19:58.630 --> 20:00.299
WITH THAT STUNNING BAY WINDOW,

20:00.365 --> 20:01.667
YOU KINDLY OFFERED TO DRIVE ME
TO THE AIRPORT

20:01.733 --> 20:03.302
IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.

WE SPEND TOGETHER.

20:09.808 --> 20:12.311
WHAT KIND OF VOODOO IS THIS?

20:15.380 --> 20:16.582
[sniffs]

20:16.648 --> 20:18.550
HONEY, ARE YOU WEARING
A NEW PERFUME?

20:18.617 --> 20:21.019
- NO, DEAR.
THAT'S HOW I BREAK WIND NOW.

20:21.086 --> 20:22.421
- RELAX, GUYS.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.323
ONLY FIVE MORE MINUTES
UNTIL THE JUDGE GETS HERE.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.891
WE JUST HAVE TO HANG ON.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.393
- EH, ALL RIGHT,
LET'S JUST WATCH SOME TV.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.761
- NO, NOT TV!

20:29.828 --> 20:31.630
IT TURNS INTO MY HOMEWORK!

20:31.697 --> 20:34.299
[all crying]

20:34.366 --> 20:35.634

20:35.701 --> 20:37.002

IT'S SUE PERCRITICAL, TIMMY!

20:37.069 --> 20:38.337
YOU GET IT.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.404
IF I GET UP,
I'M AFRAID I'LL DETAIL

20:39.471 --> 20:42.007
DINKLEBERG'S CAR AGAIN.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.809
- HELLO, TURNERS...

20:43.875 --> 20:45.043
- WE GET IT!
WE WIN!

20:45.110 --> 20:46.111
WE'RE PERFECT.
WISH IS OVER.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.579
I MEAN, THANK YOU!

20:47.646 --> 20:49.014
CONGRATULATIONS, DAD.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.582
WE'RE
THE PERFECT FAMILY.

20:50.649 --> 20:53.452
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE PERFECT FAMILY ANYMORE.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.654
I LIKED OUR OLD
IMPERFECT FAMILY

20:55.721 --> 20:57.255
WITH OUR BAD GRADES
AND OUR CEREAL

20:57.322 --> 20:59.358
THAT DIDN'T TURN INTO
HIPPIE YOGURT!

20:59.424 --> 21:00.792
I BROKE DINKLEBERG'S WINDOW,

21:00.859 --> 21:02.561
AND I DON'T FEEL
THE URGE TO FIX IT.

21:02.628 --> 21:03.929
THE CURSE IS BROKEN.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.732
[triumphant music]

21:06.798 --> 21:08.066
- COME ON, HONEY.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.369
I'LL MAKE HOT FUDGE SUNDAES
FOR DINNER.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.239
AND BY MAKE, I MEAN STEAL THEM
FROM THE STEINBERG BAR MITZVAH.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.808
- YOU DID IT, SPORT!

21:16.875 --> 21:18.944
YOU SURVIVED
BEING PERFECT.

21:19.011 --> 21:22.714
- AND NOW WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR
NORMAL, UNDERACHIEVING LIVES.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.716
- WELL, GOOD NEWS.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.485
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT
WHO I AM.

21:26.551 --> 21:27.786
- LET ME GUESS.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.454
YOU REALIZED YOU'RE HAPPY
BEING COSMO,

21:29.521 --> 21:31.657
AND YOU'RE PERFECT
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE?

OH, AND IF
MY BFF TIFFANY CALLS,

TELL HER I'LL SEE HER SATURDAY
NIGHT AT THE PEP RALLY.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.804
AND SHE IS NOT TO LOOK
AT TREVOR.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.406
HE'S MINE!

21:47.472 --> 21:50.342

GET THIS GUY OFF ME?
