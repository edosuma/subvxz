00:05.139 --> 00:06.704
- Tristan, that day
in the locker room...

00:06.707 --> 00:08.873
- Nowak, wasn't wrong.
- You two know each other?

00:08.876 --> 00:10.475
- We were partners
in flight school.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.110
- Caught red-handed.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.679
- Jeremy?
You just disappeared

00:13.681 --> 00:15.713
And then you show up at my job
dressed as a paramedic?

00:15.716 --> 00:18.684
- Training as a pcp.
- I worked way too hard

00:18.786 --> 00:20.819
Just get distracted now.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.121
- That tough kid at five

00:22.222 --> 00:23.622
Is going to turn
you off your own.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.591
-<i> You're a match for a patient</i>
<i> in toronto</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:27.192
<i> On a waitlist for a kidney.</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:28.660
<i> Recipient is a close</i>
<i> genetic relative.</i>

00:28.762 --> 00:31.864
- I'm looking for jay chopra.
- Do you know chopper?

00:31.866 --> 00:33.365
- I'm his wife.

00:36.636 --> 00:38.103
- I mean,
what's she even doing here?

00:38.105 --> 00:40.372
They're divorced.
Okay, what, he gets hurt

00:40.474 --> 00:43.342
And sunita shows up
claiming to be his wife?

00:43.344 --> 00:44.609
(sizzling)
I mean...

00:44.612 --> 00:45.811
What does she even
want from him?

00:45.813 --> 00:47.145
- If it's screaming,
it's in pain.

00:47.247 --> 00:48.814
Don't scald it.
- I'm trying to.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.549
- I don't know what the deal
with sunita is.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.383
But the important thing
right now is chopper

00:52.386 --> 00:53.885
- It's been 24 hours.
Shouldn't he have

00:53.888 --> 00:55.287
Woken up by now?
- It depends how fast

00:55.389 --> 00:56.922
The swelling comes down.
- Emergency!

00:57.024 --> 00:59.091
Sorry guys,
medical emergency.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.826
Sorry folks,
you know how it is?

01:00.828 --> 01:03.495
Emergencies.
Okay, buddy. So...

01:03.497 --> 01:05.597
We've got two oat milk, dude.
And one's got the syrup,

01:05.699 --> 01:07.499
Don't forget that.
It's important, okay?

01:07.501 --> 01:08.767
Oh. Hey, crys...

01:08.769 --> 01:10.235
- Jeremy.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.504
- You're a paramedic now?
- In training.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.973
Five months, right, jer?

01:14.975 --> 01:16.108
- Yeah.

01:16.209 --> 01:18.776
- A plot twist up
in the north, eh?

01:18.779 --> 01:21.080
- Hey boss, you got a phone?

01:21.181 --> 01:22.848
I twisted my knee,

01:22.950 --> 01:24.449
Need to call my wife
to come get me.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.384
- Want me to take a look?
I can...

01:26.486 --> 01:28.620
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, yeah. Take a seat.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.023
(groans)

01:32.359 --> 01:34.593
- I haven't done this
in a couple of years.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.060
Must have overdone it.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.863
Trying to get in shape
for summer, you know?

01:37.964 --> 01:39.198
- I'd say you've got time,
buddy.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.999
- Anyway,
started to get all lightheaded,

01:41.101 --> 01:42.601
Twisted the dang thing.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.269
- Yeah, it's swollen.
Probably just sprained.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.404
I can wrap it for you
if you want.

01:46.506 --> 01:47.773
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.347
(speaking nêhiyawêwin)

01:55.449 --> 01:57.483
It's going to slide right off,
you need to cross it.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.053
I know what I'm doing.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.890
Tighter, that's the whole point
of wrapping it.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.292
- Crys, can you just let me do
my job, okay, please.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.893
- Oh, it's been
my job a lot longer.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.662
- Okay, well,
right now, I'm doing it.

02:10.764 --> 02:11.997
- Yeah,
and you're not doing it right.

02:12.098 --> 02:13.665
(groaning)
I'm just trying to help you,
jer.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.833
- Oh, whoa, whoa.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.637
- He was lightheaded.
Could be heart.

02:18.738 --> 02:20.839
He's arresting, he needs cpr.
Start compressions.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.540
- I haven't done.
I've only done it on dummies.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.343
- Just do compressions.
Anybody can handle that.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.879
Can you call an actual
ambulance, bodie.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.013
- Okay...

02:29.016 --> 02:30.182
(crack)
I just broke something,

02:30.284 --> 02:31.483
I just broke something.
- Keep going,

02:31.585 --> 02:33.318
That's normal. C'mon.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.522
- One, two, three, four,
five, six...

02:39.193 --> 02:41.393
- 57-year-old male,
cardiac arrest

02:41.495 --> 02:43.061
Following strenuous activity.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.596
- Ms. Highway,
you seem to be everywhere.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.398
Your clinical doesn't
start until nine.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.200
- Yeah, somehow work
always finds me.

02:48.301 --> 02:50.802
Among other things.
- Bay 3, get a crash cart,

02:50.804 --> 02:53.004
Let's go. We've got it!

02:53.007 --> 02:54.473
- He's going to be okay, right?

02:54.575 --> 02:56.375
Right? He's going to be okay?

02:56.476 --> 02:58.544
- He was lucky enough to get
cpr as soon as he arrested.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.612
He'd be luckier if he got
it from someone who actually

03:00.614 --> 03:02.281
Knew what they were doing...
- Crys, I know

03:02.283 --> 03:04.883
I blanked back there.
I do know some stuff.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.618
- Cpr is basic, jeremy.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.486
It's the easiest thing
we'll do in the field.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.355
- We can't all be perfect
out of the gate, crys.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.856
Alright?
Some of us make mistakes.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.592
- We don't get to make mistakes.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.497
It's saving lives.

03:22.036 --> 03:24.503
(suspenseful music)

03:25.639 --> 03:27.572
- The fryer's busted again.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.507
Then I guess you're going
to have to fix it again.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.575
Better hop to champ,

03:30.577 --> 03:32.177
It's going
to be lunch rush soon.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.645
- You got it, champ.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.913
(laughing)

03:35.916 --> 03:37.549
(groans)

03:39.053 --> 03:41.186
Damn it, now I got to mop too.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.454
(laughing)

03:42.555 --> 03:44.056
Oh, god,
this thing is heavy.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.193
(groaning)
- oh my god!

03:48.295 --> 03:50.696
(groaning)

03:50.698 --> 03:52.064
- I'm alright, becca.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.069
(ominous tone)

03:58.072 --> 04:00.439
(tense music)

04:08.115 --> 04:11.282
- So, wait.
Is she his wife, or not?

04:11.285 --> 04:14.353
- That is... Unclear.

04:14.355 --> 04:17.356
All I know about chopper's ex
is they got married young,

04:17.358 --> 04:19.491
And she didn't want him
to be a pilot.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.826
- Dude, flying
is chopper's life.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.262
Telling him not to fly is like
telling him not to breathe.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.764
- Right?
- Never be with someone

04:25.865 --> 04:27.566
Who doesn't want me
to follow my dreams.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.934
- Yeah. Oh!
- Yikes. It's cold out there.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.103
You are like ice.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.739
- And you're hot,
temperature-wise.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.643
- Uh... I'll go this way,
yeah, there we go.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.984
- You camping out here, boss?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.920
- Uh, kind of.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.589
Yeah, you know,
with the expansion.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.190
Sometimes it's just easier
to crash here, huh?

04:52.192 --> 04:54.192
- Right.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.860
(pagers beeping)

04:55.962 --> 04:57.996
- So...

04:58.098 --> 04:59.831
Should you ladies
turn around or will I?

05:03.236 --> 05:04.936
- He's in here.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.805
(groaning)

05:06.807 --> 05:07.906
Careful!

05:08.007 --> 05:09.674
- Whoa!

05:09.676 --> 05:12.677
- Slippery.
- Yeah, safety first.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.212
Thanks, boss.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.449
Here, I got you
right down here.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.452
- It hurts...

05:20.554 --> 05:22.487
- I know.
I need to take a look

05:22.489 --> 05:24.089
And I'm going to try
to be gentle, okay?

05:24.190 --> 05:26.924
Extensive burns
to the chest and neck,

05:26.927 --> 05:28.693
But your airway seems clear.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.995
Are you having any
trouble breathing?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.662
- My face is burning.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.598
- Okay, I'm going
to start an iv for the pain.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.434
Grab the burn dressings
from my bag?

05:35.436 --> 05:37.034
- Yeah.
- Glove up first.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.105
- Is it going to scar?
- Let's not worry about that

05:40.107 --> 05:41.773
Right now, okay?
- You don't understand.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.241
I've had, like,
really bad acne.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.042
Like, really bad for years.
Do you know what it's like

05:45.045 --> 05:46.378
To have a messed-up face?

05:46.479 --> 05:49.548
It's all anyone can see.
Can't even hide it.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.917
- Here you go.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.352
- Okay.
This is going to sting.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.053
- Face first.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.523
- The burn is on your neck.
- I don't care.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.858
Please.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.063
- Cut four holes in a dressing.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.932
Eyes, nose, mouth.
- Okay.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.366
- I got a prescription
for my acne

06:08.368 --> 06:10.402
A couple months ago.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.672
People finally saw me.
Not the pizza face.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.208
I asked becca to spring formal,
and she actually said yes.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.144
Because I didn't look
like a freak anymore.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.512
Please,
I can't go back to that.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.883
- Just try to relax, okay?

06:27.253 --> 06:29.020
- Thank you.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.556
- It's okay.
We understand about scars.

06:33.359 --> 06:36.094
(plane engine revving)

06:39.199 --> 06:41.366
Hey, I just dropped off
my patient.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.701
- I brought some
of my practice lattes from work.

06:43.803 --> 06:46.037
If this doesn't wake
chopper up, nothing will.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.841
- Okay,
he isn't intubated anymore,

06:49.843 --> 06:51.309
Which is a good sign.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.211
They must expect him
to wake up soon.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.714
- Hey, guys.
- How's he doing,

06:55.716 --> 06:57.782
What're the doctors saying?
- Not much.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.317
At least, not to us.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.353
They're only sharing updates
with the immediate family.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.456
- But, after we
brought him in yesterday,

07:04.458 --> 07:05.924
They were giving
us updates.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.359
- The family has decided
they don't want

07:08.362 --> 07:09.861
His medical information
released.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.330
- Seriously?
We're his family.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.531
They're divorced.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.333
- She's still
his emergency contact.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.269
- Okay, so,
chopper forgot to update

07:17.370 --> 07:18.403
After they got a divorce.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.672
- Or they really
are back together.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.340
Either way, the hospital
has to respect her wishes.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.842
- Can we go see him at least?

07:24.711 --> 07:26.611
- The family
isn't allowing visitors.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.079
- Who does this woman
think she is?

07:28.181 --> 07:30.015
She hasn't been in his life
for years, now she's back

07:30.017 --> 07:31.549
Acting like she means
something to him,

07:31.552 --> 07:32.884
Just because he's going
to be an astronaut

07:32.886 --> 07:35.187
And she thinks she can get
something from him?

07:36.789 --> 07:38.222
- Okay, so...

07:38.225 --> 07:40.625
That didn't seem like
it's just about chopper.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.061
- My clinical.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.098
(somber music)

07:49.636 --> 07:51.770
- This is the type of thing

07:51.872 --> 07:53.438
You'd usually talk
to chopper about,

07:53.440 --> 07:54.973
But...

07:55.709 --> 07:57.008
Ta-da!

07:58.344 --> 07:59.377
You okay?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.146
- I got a call
from donor screening.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.147
They found a close
genetic relative.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.983
- Bodie, that's great.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.385
Who is it?
Is it your mom?

08:07.387 --> 08:09.521
- Whoever it is.
They only came looking

08:09.523 --> 08:10.922
Because they need a kidney.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.992
I told donor screening
to lose my number.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.428
But...
What if it is jolene?

08:18.164 --> 08:20.332
What if...

08:20.334 --> 08:21.933
What if she knows
that I've been looking for her

08:21.935 --> 08:23.868
This entire time,

08:23.970 --> 08:25.403
And she just didn't care,
until she needed

08:25.505 --> 08:26.805
Something from me?

08:26.907 --> 08:29.107
(distant sirens)

08:30.610 --> 08:32.344
- Look...

08:32.346 --> 08:34.012
I know it's different,
but...

08:34.113 --> 08:36.314
The last six months
since my surgery,

08:37.383 --> 08:38.950
Really made me think
about what my mom

08:38.952 --> 08:40.618
Went through when she was sick.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.089
No one should go through
that alone, bodie.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.560
- But sharing dna
doesn't make you family.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.629
Chopper's family.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.464
I owe it to him
to be in there.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.670
- You know...

09:00.073 --> 09:03.441
Anyone can go anywhere
in a hospital wearing scrubs.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.280
(gentle music)

09:15.221 --> 09:17.822
(buzzing)

09:27.067 --> 09:29.433
- Why are you wearing
pajamas in space?

09:29.436 --> 09:31.269
- Chops, you're awake.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.871
Are you okay?

09:32.973 --> 09:35.206
You were in an accident.
What do you remember?

09:35.208 --> 09:38.610
- I was in selection camp...

09:41.481 --> 09:44.716
Doing an impossible
exercise, and...

09:48.889 --> 09:51.356
I thought I had more time.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.991
- Your propane tank blew.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.660
What were you doing up
in that fire tower?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.030
- I was trying to simulate
a space walk.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.298
- In manitoba?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.166
Why weren't you
at selection camp?

10:02.869 --> 10:06.838
- They were giving everyone
in the final sixteen time off.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.074
Before they selected
two astronauts,

10:09.076 --> 10:10.975
I was going to come see you.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.443
Bods, I really was.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.946
I just, I wanted
to practice more.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.715
- What about you and sunita?
You didn't tell me

10:17.817 --> 10:19.117
You two were back together.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.585
- I'm sorry, I must have
hit my head pretty hard.

10:21.588 --> 10:22.988
You...

10:23.089 --> 10:25.123
I thought you said sunita.

10:25.224 --> 10:26.524
- Jay?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.193
- Suni?

10:28.294 --> 10:29.627
What are you doing here?

10:29.729 --> 10:31.062
- When someone's
in an explosion,

10:31.064 --> 10:33.498
They usually call
their emergency contact.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.534
(speaking hindi)

10:44.711 --> 10:46.044
- I'm glad you came, suni.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.579
- Wasn't sure you would be.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.114
- I mean, it's...

10:50.216 --> 10:52.016
It's embarrassing.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.219
First time seeing each other
since the divorce.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.821
And I'm all banged up
in a backless nightie.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.323
- You make it work.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.693
- Honestly, suni,
I'm okay.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.064
Except, my arm is killing me.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.404
Uh... I'm...

11:13.940 --> 11:15.540
Glad you came.

11:18.711 --> 11:19.844
- Okay.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.580
I guess I'll go get the doctor.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.020
- Bodie texted,

11:30.023 --> 11:31.189
"they're doing tests,

11:31.191 --> 11:32.323
But chopper is in good spirits."

11:32.425 --> 11:33.858
And apparently,
he's happy sunita is here

11:33.960 --> 11:35.593
So you know
there's a story...

11:36.663 --> 11:39.564
- Hey, blow a fuse, nowie?
It's March.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.199
- What's the matter, skippy?
Scared of the cold

11:41.301 --> 11:42.867
Or just getting
your ass whooped?

11:42.869 --> 11:44.201
(laughing)
- we used to play

11:44.204 --> 11:45.402
In flight school.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.072
You just think this is going
to give you an edge

11:48.074 --> 11:50.075
Because of your
icy polish blood.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.277
(exhaling)

11:52.378 --> 11:53.678
- Brave move,
dogging the captain

11:53.780 --> 11:54.879
Doing your line check tomorrow.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.816
C'mon, lex,
cadets versus civvies.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.285
C'mon, tris.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.921
Chopper's awake
and it's only minus five.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.090
Time to celebrate.

12:05.191 --> 12:08.359
(♪ raise a little hell ♪

- She's good.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.457
- C'mon, hayley's cheating.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.492
She's wearing a shirt while
we're freezing our buns off.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.893
- Yeah, c'mon, hayls.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.295
Even the score,
show some skin.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.963
(hollering)

13:19.065 --> 13:20.431
- I'm on early tomorrow,

13:20.533 --> 13:22.099
I'm going to quit
while I'm ahead.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.334
- Alright.
- Nice job, hayley.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.044
(gentle music)

13:44.257 --> 13:46.724
- Fire up the grill,
I'll grab burgers.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.830
(shivering)

14:13.253 --> 14:14.752
(sighs)

14:14.854 --> 14:17.922
- We have to be so careful
with our hearts.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.228
They are so strong
but so vulnerable.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.031
Your fall caused cardiac
and pulmonary contusions.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.766
Swelling to the heart and lungs.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.035
And there was some bleeding
around the sac of the heart.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.970
But you were lucky,

14:33.072 --> 14:35.773
You got a pericardiocentesis
when you needed it.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.444
With time, your heart
and lungs should heal.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.512
- Will he be able to go back
to selection camp?

14:42.648 --> 14:44.315
- Not for this intake.
I'm sorry, mr. Chopra.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.285
- But this is only
the second intake

14:47.387 --> 14:49.853
Spc has had in 50 years.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.923
There might not be
another one for decades.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.257
- I'm not going
to be an astronaut.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.093
- I'm so sorry, jay.

14:56.763 --> 14:57.896
- What about my hand?

14:58.632 --> 14:59.964
I still can't move my fingers.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.066
- The surgeon removed
a lot of shrapnel

15:02.168 --> 15:03.534
From your forearm and your hand.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.669
It caused damage
to your muscles,

15:05.672 --> 15:08.273
Tendons,
your nerves were severed.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.008
- That's just temporary, right?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.144
I can get it back.
- We'll wait for the swelling

15:13.245 --> 15:14.946
To go down to evaluate
next steps.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.481
- Wait, forget being
an astronaut.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.883
If chopper can't use his hand...

15:19.886 --> 15:21.719
- I can't be a pilot.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.166
(plane engine revving)

15:35.268 --> 15:36.867
- The little guy kept coming
back to the hangar

15:36.969 --> 15:38.936
And he was just so cute.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.806
Every time I tried to feed him,
he tried to bite my glove.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.108
- It's an arctic fox, reese,
not a dog.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.745
- Yeah, but I'm a sucker
for big brown eyes.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.450
- What's the 200's max airspeed

15:52.452 --> 15:54.051
For effective windshield
anti-icing?

15:54.153 --> 15:55.653
- Oh, wow...

15:55.755 --> 15:56.787
226 knots.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.055
- Max takeoff weight?

15:58.157 --> 15:59.724
- Work-mode, huh nowie?

15:59.825 --> 16:01.259
Twelve, five.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.261
- Overweight landing policy?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.198
- Um, I-I'd have
to check that one.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.800
- I'm not signing you off
on this aircraft

16:08.802 --> 16:10.468
Until you know it cold,
hassan.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.270
Landing checklist.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.509
- Turkey or p.B.?

16:18.511 --> 16:20.345
I don't know what's up
with you today,

16:20.446 --> 16:21.679
But reese is your friend.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.081
And you were way hard on him

16:23.182 --> 16:24.615
So clearly you need a sandwich.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.818
- What does "no hard feelings"
mean, tristan?

16:26.820 --> 16:29.220
- What?
- I found the note.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.489
You've seen
the way he is with you.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.690
What happened
with you and reese?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.159
- Nothing.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.695
After pierce's accident,
he was upset.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.731
I tried to talk him
through it, and...

16:40.700 --> 16:41.899
He kissed me.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.503
- He kissed you?
- Nothing happened, nowak.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.972
It's not that big of a deal.
I told him I have a boyfriend

16:48.074 --> 16:49.440
And he didn't know it was you.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.275
- Why didn't you tell me?

16:51.377 --> 16:53.311
- Because it wasn't
a big deal?

16:53.980 --> 16:55.312
I knew you'd freak out.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.881
And we all have
to work together.

16:56.982 --> 16:58.983
Honestly, it's nothing.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.452
He was upset,
and he kissed me.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.355
- Why did he feel
like he could kiss you, tris?

17:05.158 --> 17:06.857
You always need an escape plan,

17:06.860 --> 17:09.193
A way out, another option.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.729
What did you do
to make him feel

17:11.831 --> 17:12.863
Like he had a chance?

17:12.866 --> 17:15.133
- Milosz, I need you
to trust me.

17:18.138 --> 17:21.139
(soft music)

17:22.908 --> 17:24.475
- He's really upset.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.211
- What's chopper going
to do if he can't fly?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.347
- Being a pilot,
having a dream like this

17:29.349 --> 17:31.682
It gives you purpose,
gives you focus so...

17:32.685 --> 17:34.352
Becomes your everything.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.020
Without that...

17:38.324 --> 17:40.625
- Somebody owe you money?
You keep rubbing your palm,

17:40.726 --> 17:42.026
Isn't that supposed to mean
money's coming?

17:42.128 --> 17:43.628
- Yeah, in this case,
I think it just means

17:43.729 --> 17:45.429
That I shouldn't have grabbed
that porch rail

17:45.531 --> 17:46.964
When we picked up
that last patient.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.233
Got a sliver.
- Let me take a look at that.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.402
- Oh, it's not that bad.
It's just a sliver.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.605
- No, that is the whole porch.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.041
I'm going to remove it
so it doesn't get infected.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.811
Here, hop up so I can
get at you better in the light.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.849
Okay.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.356
(humming)

18:19.599 --> 18:21.465
- It's just this thing
I used to in cadets

18:21.567 --> 18:23.734
To help me get through
the tough parts of training.

18:23.836 --> 18:24.936
- Right.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.407
- I'm scared of needles.
Now you know my secret.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.343
- Girl, I've seen you pick up
a snake with a pair of forceps.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.879
(laughing)
- I can handle snakes.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.615
And blood,
and guts, and puke.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.350
But ooh, needles...

18:39.352 --> 18:41.485
(laughing)
- okay.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.820
Alright, what are we singing?

18:42.922 --> 18:44.455
- Same song since
I was fourteen.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.960
♪ row, row, row your boat ♪

18:48.962 --> 18:51.362
♪ gently down the stream ♪
♪ row, row, row your boat ♪

18:51.464 --> 18:53.865
♪ merrily, merrily, merrily ♪
♪ gently down the stream ♪

18:53.966 --> 18:56.100
♪ life is but a dream ♪
♪ merrily, merrily, merrily ♪

18:56.202 --> 18:58.769
♪ row, row, row your boat ♪
♪ life is but a dream ♪

18:58.771 --> 19:01.072
♪ gently down the stream ♪
♪ row, row, row your boat ♪

19:01.174 --> 19:03.707
♪ merrily, merrily, merrily ♪
♪ gently down the stream ♪

19:03.809 --> 19:06.244
♪ life is but a dream ♪♪

19:08.347 --> 19:09.847
Are we done yet?
I can't look.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.116
- I finished four boats ago.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.451
Maybe I just
like holding your hand.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.854
(chuckling)

19:18.858 --> 19:21.125
(upbeat music)

19:30.103 --> 19:31.469
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.071
I should not have done that.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.806
That was wildly inappropriate.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.341
- Or hella sexy.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.710
Let me clean this
and we can pick back up.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.946
- No, no. No, no, no.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.414
No, I...

19:44.918 --> 19:46.383
Stef...

19:46.485 --> 19:48.653
Look, I want to, I do.
It's just...

19:50.256 --> 19:52.889
The thing about dreams,

19:52.892 --> 19:55.158
I'm still working on mine.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.862
And it takes all of my focus.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.698
It's my whole life really.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.165
I just don't want
to start something

20:02.168 --> 20:05.435
That I can't commit to.
Or lead you on.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.871
I'm sorry.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.774
- The old
"you're too good for me" excuse.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.243
- That's not what I meant.
- No, it's...

20:13.212 --> 20:17.114
It's cool.
This stuff happens, you know?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.983
The energy's right.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.118
But the time was off.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.454
Hey, we can still be friends.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.056
- Yeah, friends.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.591
(chuckling)

20:28.861 --> 20:31.929
(gentle music)

20:38.704 --> 20:40.204
- I know it sucks.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.772
But the doctor says
you've got to get moving

20:41.874 --> 20:42.973
After heart surgery.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.475
(groaning)
that's it, that's it.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.143
Just one step at a time.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.145
- I can't.
Please, I need to rest.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.346
- You can do a little more.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.081
We haven't been around
the floor yet.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.984
- Ugh... I need to sit.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.052
- Look,

20:55.054 --> 20:57.154
I know not going back
to selection camp is tough,

20:57.256 --> 20:59.023
But you're going to come back
stronger than ever, chopper.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.825
- When I didn't get the job
at ac,

21:00.926 --> 21:02.426
I was ready to give up...

21:02.528 --> 21:04.828
- That's not the same thing,
bodes.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.832
You were sulking
because you didn't get a job.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.400
Were you even listening
in there?

21:09.501 --> 21:13.504
My heart and lungs
"should" recover.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.307
I "might" be able
to use my hand.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.909
- Chops...
- It's my goddamn hand, bodie.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.978
No, I might be able to live
with the fact

21:20.980 --> 21:23.180
That I'm not going to be
an astronaut anymore.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.849
But I screwed myself out
of the only backup plan

21:25.852 --> 21:27.118
That I ever had.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.852
Because of
my own goddamn fault.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.188
So no,
this isn't just a job for me,

21:31.190 --> 21:33.557
Bodie, alright?
This is my whole life.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.328
Now what do I have?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.663
- Chops?

21:38.764 --> 21:40.263
Chops!

21:40.266 --> 21:42.166
Help! I need some help!

21:50.143 --> 21:52.042
Chopper is gonna be able
to use his hand again.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.944
He's going to be able
to fly again too.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.446
He has to.

21:56.182 --> 21:57.882
- It might not be
that simple, bodie,

21:57.983 --> 22:00.417
But we'll make sure
that he has the best care.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.353
He just had
a pulmonary embolism.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.021
Plus, all his injuries
from the explosion.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.556
- He just needs some motivation.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.892
Something to work towards.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.094
Can't dr. Yana phone
space program canada

22:10.195 --> 22:12.163
And get them to wait
until he's recovered?

22:12.165 --> 22:14.632
I mean, it's chopper, crys.
The best.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.166
You really think
they're going to reject him

22:16.169 --> 22:17.735
Just because he needs
some time to heal?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.970
- Yeah, I...

22:19.972 --> 22:21.238
I called them.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.808
- Yeah, and?
- Bodie...

22:25.111 --> 22:27.545
They said they couldn't
take him back because...

22:29.014 --> 22:30.714
He was already cut
from selection camp.

22:30.716 --> 22:33.116
- What?
- Two weeks ago.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.952
Before his accident.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.390
He didn't make
the final sixteen.

22:43.996 --> 22:47.131
(groaning)
- god... It hurts.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.067
(speaking hindi)

22:50.169 --> 22:52.269
Are you okay? Do you want
me to call the doctor?

22:52.271 --> 22:53.737
- Me waking up every day
in the hospital

22:53.740 --> 22:56.340
Looking like this
while you look like that is...

22:56.442 --> 22:58.008
Really unfair.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.684
The doctor said
you did well in surgery.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.618
They're even talking
about discharging you soon.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.021
And since everybody
in your fan club is dying

23:11.023 --> 23:12.423
To take care of you,

23:12.525 --> 23:14.458
You don't need me hanging
around thompson anymore.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.296
- Suni...
You don't have to go.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.705
- No, I should get back.
You know how papa is.

23:31.844 --> 23:35.045
He says you were the best
engineer he ever had.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.981
I think,

23:37.984 --> 23:40.985
That's why I didn't
want you to fly.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.129
When we were
in engineering school,

23:52.231 --> 23:54.731
You were so effortlessly
good at it.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.735
And I had to try so hard
to just figure out

23:57.737 --> 23:59.570
The things you knew how to do.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.771
- C'mon, suni,
you were the better engineer.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.173
- No.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.775
It just seemed like such a waste
for someone

24:04.777 --> 24:06.577
So talented to do anything else.

24:07.713 --> 24:08.979
You know?

24:11.250 --> 24:14.185
- You understand why
I had to though, right?

24:15.921 --> 24:17.455
Why I had to be an astronaut.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.224
- Your grandfather.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.928
- Every summer,
my family and I went to india.

24:25.264 --> 24:28.632
My dadaji and I would lay
out on the terrace,

24:28.734 --> 24:31.969
We'd look up at the stars.
He could... Name them all.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.941
Gosh, the sky was just
so much bigger there, you know?

24:38.044 --> 24:41.846
And I knew then
that I wanted to be up there.

24:44.250 --> 24:47.184
Always thought I would
teach our kids about the stars.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.019
- You still can.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.455
You don't have to be
an astronaut

24:51.557 --> 24:53.657
Or a pilot to do that.

24:54.727 --> 24:58.395
- But they wouldn't be our kids,
would they?

24:58.497 --> 24:59.897
- Jay...
- Suni.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.805
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.273
I just...

25:10.642 --> 25:13.611
You were the one, suni,
for so long.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.348
And after,
I always wondered about us,

25:17.449 --> 25:19.984
About what could
have been different, if...

25:21.787 --> 25:23.387
I... Could have been different.

25:26.658 --> 25:27.891
I mean,
I get it, I get it.

25:27.893 --> 25:30.494
I mean, we both moved on.

25:30.496 --> 25:32.363
You built a whole new life, I...

25:33.366 --> 25:35.065
Have to...

25:36.902 --> 25:39.737
(emotional music)

26:06.866 --> 26:08.232
Please.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.004
- You have to commit.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.072
If we don't commit to the lift,
someone will get hurt.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.208
- I know, it's just
that we open tomorrow night.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.478
- And everybody will be
expecting the lift.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.813
I shimmy down the aisle.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.083
Kick-ball, change, five, six,

26:26.085 --> 26:27.551
Hip-thrust, hip-thrust.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.286
The spotlight hits you.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.754
You give me the nod.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.089
The audience lights up

26:32.091 --> 26:34.458
And you run towards me
for the lift.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.430
This is our chance

26:39.432 --> 26:43.033
To finally bring theatre
to prospect river.

26:43.035 --> 26:46.036
Now, we have been practicing
this dance

26:46.138 --> 26:48.839
Since we saw the movie
in grade three.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.641
You can do it, sweetie.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.511
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.115
(upbeat 50s music plays)

27:05.290 --> 27:06.357
Ready?

27:07.593 --> 27:10.628
Five, six, seven,
and smile!

27:22.007 --> 27:23.741
I really thought I had her.

27:23.842 --> 27:25.576
You know, the minute
I tried to lift her up,

27:25.578 --> 27:27.544
I pulled this muscle
in my chest.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.879
- We'll get you to tch
for stitches and a reduction.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.549
How's the pain?
(mumbling)

27:32.551 --> 27:34.084
Yeah, it's dislocated.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.620
Let's take a look there.

27:36.622 --> 27:39.289
- Oh, wow,
that's a lot of...

27:39.391 --> 27:41.759
- Just, hold on... Oh!

27:41.860 --> 27:43.961
(muffled): He really
hates blood.

27:44.063 --> 27:47.164
- Yeah,
some people are squeamish.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.466
- What's the max itt
for the start?

27:49.468 --> 27:51.635
- 1,000 degrees
for five seconds.

27:51.737 --> 27:52.769
- What powers the itt gauge?

27:52.871 --> 27:54.304
(chuckles)
- dc.

27:54.406 --> 27:58.042
Dc dies, ac lies.
You taught me that, remember?

27:58.143 --> 28:00.544
- This is your takeoff.
Line it up.

28:04.616 --> 28:06.983
(propellers whirring)

28:06.986 --> 28:08.051
It's icy.

28:08.053 --> 28:09.252
We got a quartering tail,

28:09.354 --> 28:11.021
Be careful when you bring it up.

28:15.994 --> 28:17.594
You're spooling up fast
on the right.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.930
Spooling up fast on the right,
you're weathervaning.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.565
- I have control!

28:24.636 --> 28:26.970
(tense music)

28:43.122 --> 28:44.888
I don't see any damage.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.690
Walk around looks good.

28:46.792 --> 28:49.159
We'll have to dig
the poor girl out though.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.428
- We need to wait
for an ame to okay it.

28:51.530 --> 28:52.963
- Nowak, we slid

28:53.064 --> 28:54.431
But we didn't hit anything,
okay?

28:54.533 --> 28:57.034
Props and gear are intact.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.369
- Wait for an ame to okay it.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.570
- Nowak...

29:00.672 --> 29:02.172
Nowak!

29:02.274 --> 29:03.974
There isn't any damage.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.578
We could dig the gear out,
push it back.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.581
- I told you, "be careful
when setting the power."

29:10.682 --> 29:11.782
You didn't listen.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.517
- Okay, and you
slammed on the breaks.

29:13.619 --> 29:16.653
- I'm an experienced captain,
you're a rookie f.O.

29:16.655 --> 29:19.022
Maybe you'll listen better
in your next line check.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.124
- What?
- I can't check you out

29:21.127 --> 29:22.926
On a plane you can't fly.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.195
You have to redo
your line check.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.365
- Nowak, c'mon.
You know what this means to me.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.437
(emotional music)

29:36.041 --> 29:37.607
- I shouldn't have pushed you.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.143
I should have listened
when you said

29:39.244 --> 29:42.011
That you were uncomfortable.
I just, I wanted it to work

29:42.014 --> 29:43.413
So bad, you know?

29:43.415 --> 29:45.082
- Just try to relax, okay?

29:45.084 --> 29:46.550
As soon as we get
a mechanic up here,

29:46.552 --> 29:47.818
We'll get you to a hospital.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.586
- We've been best friends
since we were five.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.221
It's our favourite movie.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.023
I wanted to get it right.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.625
For both of us.
- I wanted to get it right, too.

29:55.628 --> 29:58.028
Really. I'm sorry.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.030
- What? No, no.
I'm the one who's sorry.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.299
I wanted you to trust me,
I can't ask you to trust me

30:03.302 --> 30:05.368
If I'm going to
literally let you down

30:05.371 --> 30:07.171
By doing something stupid.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.105
- Aww...
(chuckles)

30:09.207 --> 30:12.242
Ow, ow, ow.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.511
- You guys hang tight,
alright?

30:14.613 --> 30:16.380
I'll be right back.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.650
- I understand.
Yup, thanks, bye.

30:22.354 --> 30:23.854
(sighs)

30:23.856 --> 30:25.322
- Nowak.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.857
- Ames are going
to be a couple of hours.

30:27.860 --> 30:28.992
- I'm sorry.

30:30.429 --> 30:33.063
I-I screwed up.
You were right.

30:33.165 --> 30:37.533
I got a little freaked about
things getting serious

30:37.536 --> 30:39.670
With us and...

30:39.672 --> 30:41.137
I let reese kiss me.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.540
But he didn't know
you were my boyfriend, nowak.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.209
And as soon as it happened,

30:45.310 --> 30:47.144
I realized I was wrong
and I stopped it.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.413
But I should have told you
so you know all that

30:50.416 --> 30:52.349
Instead of letting you find out
the way you did.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.284
I can't expect you to trust me

30:54.286 --> 30:56.653
If I don't tell you everything
you need to know.

30:58.891 --> 31:01.358
I have to trust you enough
to tell you.

31:04.129 --> 31:05.429
- I'm sorry too.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.231
If you say it's just a kiss

31:08.233 --> 31:09.433
And there's nothing
to worry about

31:09.435 --> 31:10.968
Then there's nothing
to worry about.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.570
(uplifting, emotional music)

31:20.745 --> 31:22.145
- That one meant something.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.782
(chuckling)

31:27.486 --> 31:29.719
- I know I have
a hard time trusting.

31:29.722 --> 31:32.856
I just, I... Always expect
people to let me down.

31:32.958 --> 31:36.126
And if I think they do, I go
to the worst place right away.

31:36.962 --> 31:40.130
When I was 16,
my brother...

31:40.132 --> 31:41.932
(muffled screaming)

31:45.671 --> 31:46.870
- What happened?

31:46.972 --> 31:48.705
(panicked mumbling)

31:48.807 --> 31:51.174
His chest? Okay.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.944
His pulse is weaker on one side.

31:54.045 --> 31:55.378
He needs to get a hospital.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.480
(grunting)

31:57.582 --> 31:58.982
- That should do it.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.520
- Ready, tristan?
- Got it.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.423
- Thank you for trusting me
on this.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.225
- Heave!

32:08.327 --> 32:10.127
Heave!

32:10.862 --> 32:12.495
Heave!

32:12.498 --> 32:14.197
(plan engine revving)

32:16.401 --> 32:18.735
- 43-year-old male,
presenting with ripping pain

32:18.837 --> 32:21.371
In the chest, back, neck,
syncope, differential bp.

32:21.473 --> 32:24.574
- Differential bp,
differential hr.

32:24.576 --> 32:25.875
There's an internal bleed.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.577
Something one-sided.
Heart maybe?

32:27.679 --> 32:30.247
- Could be an aortic dissection.
He needs t.E.E.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.282
- There's no sonographer
on tonight.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.850
- I'm going to do it,
you're going to assist.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.919
Grab the t.E.E. Probe.
Looks like a gastroscope.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.421
- Okay.
- There's an increasing need

32:37.423 --> 32:38.855
For emergency physicians
to be trained

32:38.857 --> 32:40.190
In this type
of procedure, especially

32:40.192 --> 32:41.692
With staffing shortages.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.467
- We go in just
like an orogastric tube.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.738
Keep an eye on the monitor.

32:55.707 --> 32:59.076
Make sure I am
keeping midline.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.415
- You're good.
- There you are.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.285
There's your heart, sir,
and there is your aorta.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.253
Okay. See that bleed there?

33:11.557 --> 33:14.224
- You were right.
Aortic dissection.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.692
- It feels a bit like magic

33:15.694 --> 33:17.494
When it all comes together,
doesn't it?

33:18.230 --> 33:19.996
Okay, we need to get him
back on your plane.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.631
He needs winnipeg for surgery.

33:21.633 --> 33:24.267
(tense buildup)

33:25.937 --> 33:28.171
- 43-year-old man,
this is the aortic dissection

33:28.173 --> 33:29.506
From thompson.
- I haven't examined

33:29.508 --> 33:30.773
The patient to determine
that yet.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.310
- I performed a t.E.E.
- You performed it?

33:33.312 --> 33:34.945
Not a technician?

33:35.047 --> 33:36.846
- Tch is understaffed
and dr. Yana...

33:36.849 --> 33:38.281
- Who gave you permission
to perform

33:38.283 --> 33:40.116
An invasive technique?
T.E.Es are to be performed

33:40.218 --> 33:42.352
By sonographers
or experienced er doctors.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.054
- She is an experienced...

33:44.155 --> 33:46.256
- Copy was sent to your email
45 minutes ago.

33:52.497 --> 33:54.297
- Or 4, let's go.

33:58.937 --> 34:01.505
- Why didn't you tell him
you're the head of thompson er?

34:03.409 --> 34:04.775
- Have you eaten today?

34:07.445 --> 34:09.746
Mmm.
(chuckling)

34:09.748 --> 34:10.947
- Thanks.

34:12.450 --> 34:15.819
- Best burger in the province.
Whenever I'm in winnipeg.

34:17.388 --> 34:22.159
My first day as an attending
at winnipeg memorial,

34:22.161 --> 34:23.493
I thought about my mom.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.695
I thought about how proud
she would be

34:25.797 --> 34:28.365
That her daughter
wasn't just a doctor,

34:29.234 --> 34:31.435
But one who taught other
people to be doctors.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.371
So...

34:34.473 --> 34:38.441
When one of my residents
assumed I was an orderly,

34:38.543 --> 34:40.243
When I had to show him
my badge

34:40.245 --> 34:43.446
To prove to him
that I was his teacher,

34:43.448 --> 34:45.916
I came here
and I ordered a burger.

34:45.918 --> 34:49.186
At 3 a.M. I was glad my mom
didn't have to see that.

34:50.555 --> 34:52.589
If I took the time

34:52.690 --> 34:55.392
To correct everyone who made
an assumption about me...

34:56.929 --> 34:58.728
- Is that why you came
to thompson?

35:00.365 --> 35:02.132
- I wanted to advance.

35:02.233 --> 35:04.868
Tch was the only place
desperate enough for clinicians

35:04.870 --> 35:06.202
To hire a queer black woman.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.605
- But you've done
so much for the er.

35:08.706 --> 35:10.673
- And you will too, crystal.

35:10.676 --> 35:14.410
But you are going to have
to be... Undeniable.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.345
You are going to have
to prove yourself

35:16.348 --> 35:19.082
Again and again on their terms.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.818
That you're not just
as good as they are,

35:21.820 --> 35:23.419
You're better.

35:23.421 --> 35:25.221
You're going to have
to be so good

35:25.323 --> 35:26.990
That even when they want to...

35:29.060 --> 35:31.094
Even when they want to hate you,

35:31.964 --> 35:34.631
They won't be able to deny
your right to be there.

35:34.633 --> 35:39.970
So, when you have to,
go to a diner, eat a burger.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.440
Be sad, be angry,

35:44.442 --> 35:45.976
And then...

35:47.412 --> 35:49.646
Go back and be undeniable again.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.119
You're not going to eat?

35:57.122 --> 35:59.055
Oh, man.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.891
Oh, good burger.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.095
- That's good.
- Right?

36:15.306 --> 36:17.174
(cellphone notification)

36:17.275 --> 36:19.209
(cellphone notification)

36:20.345 --> 36:21.378
(cellphone notification)

36:23.014 --> 36:24.314
- Wow.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.950
Your range of motion looks good.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.686
We're done for the night.

36:29.787 --> 36:31.888
So I thought I would
check in.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.823
Your surgeon said they were able
to debride the burns,

36:33.925 --> 36:35.358
And I saw that they're
sending you to winnipeg

36:35.460 --> 36:36.960
For a plastic surgery consult...

36:37.062 --> 36:38.494
- Tell that to becca.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.563
She just texted.

36:40.565 --> 36:43.266
She's going to spring formal
with eric.

36:44.802 --> 36:46.769
Apparently,
they really connected

36:46.772 --> 36:48.638
In chess club this week.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.373
Right after I...

36:50.475 --> 36:51.708
Burned my face off.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.744
Who wants damaged goods?

36:56.048 --> 36:57.647
(sighs)

37:02.687 --> 37:04.020
- I'll be your date.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.256
- This...

37:07.259 --> 37:09.325
Is this a pity thing?

37:09.328 --> 37:11.962
- No, no.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.532
It's a "we're not damaged goods"
thing.

37:18.303 --> 37:21.037
- Will you get me some booze?
(chuckles)

37:22.874 --> 37:25.675
- I'll get you a boutonnière.
How about that?

37:27.546 --> 37:30.780
(rhythmic music)

37:30.782 --> 37:33.283
(indistinct chatter)

37:36.088 --> 37:38.488
(all): Hey!

37:41.159 --> 37:42.759
- Okay, okay.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.365
<i> - Kocham cie.</i>

37:48.466 --> 37:50.433
- Cold ham cheese
to you too, baby.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.043
He didn't know
you were my boyfriend.

38:00.144 --> 38:01.310
Don't take this out on him,
okay?

38:01.313 --> 38:03.813
You've been friends
for a long time, okay?

38:04.983 --> 38:06.482
Okay.

38:07.252 --> 38:10.954
- Hey, new guy buys
the drinks, right?

38:11.056 --> 38:12.689
- Your money is no good tonight.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.458
Listen, I called wheezer.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.128
You don't have to redo
your line check.

38:18.229 --> 38:20.930
So... And new f.Os drink free.

38:23.668 --> 38:25.067
(chuckles)

38:25.070 --> 38:27.737
- Thanks, nowie.
That means a lot.

38:28.906 --> 38:30.740
About earlier,
if I was out of line

38:30.742 --> 38:32.342
Or if I did something
in the cockpit to...

38:32.443 --> 38:33.877
- Do you want anything else?

38:35.180 --> 38:37.747
- No, guess the three
gold bars will do it.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.086
(soul music)

38:43.188 --> 38:47.090

38:55.634 --> 38:58.835

39:09.381 --> 39:10.513
You crashing here?

39:10.515 --> 39:12.448
- Oh, yeah,
it's just that your couch

39:12.451 --> 39:14.818
Is comfier than the one
in my office, so...

39:27.899 --> 39:29.666
There's nothing like a trophy
from the time you got

39:29.768 --> 39:32.235
Into a dogfight with death
and won, huh?

39:32.337 --> 39:34.403
I can even make it dance
when I do yoga.

39:34.406 --> 39:37.040
- Can't be good for your back
to be sleeping on couches.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.343
Why are you spending
so much time at work anyway?

39:40.445 --> 39:42.545
Is it the expansion?

39:42.547 --> 39:45.881
Don't let all
the couch surfing fool you.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.818
Being chief pilot is something
I'm actually good at.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.420
I just...

39:54.626 --> 39:56.226
I just...
I needed somewhere to stay.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.032
Lynn and I separated.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.601
- Oh, wheezer...

40:07.472 --> 40:08.938
What happened?

40:12.778 --> 40:14.977
- We got together
when we were young,

40:14.980 --> 40:17.180
And we got pregnant
when we were young.

40:18.483 --> 40:19.982
I love being a dad

40:19.985 --> 40:23.486
And lynn, she's really,
really great mom.

40:24.889 --> 40:27.923
But when you get married young,
you either grow up together,

40:27.926 --> 40:29.793
Or you grow apart.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.063
And we've been holding
each other back

40:34.165 --> 40:36.866
For a while now, fighting
and not connecting, and...

40:40.171 --> 40:42.705
I didn't want that for her,
and she didn't want that for me.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.575
- I'm sorry.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.345
- Yeah.

40:49.347 --> 40:50.814
Yeah, me too.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.950
We've been separated
for five months,

40:53.952 --> 40:55.684
But last week
we made it permanent.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.887
You know what they about pilots,
sooner or later,

40:57.989 --> 41:00.790
We all end up in
an aviation-induced divorce.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.496
Enough of my garbage.
(chuckles)

41:06.498 --> 41:07.997
You're home early.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.768
Was there no good dance partners
at the whiskey hatch?

41:13.037 --> 41:14.871
(sighs)

41:16.508 --> 41:19.442
Looks like we could
both use pancakes.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.046
C'mon, greenhorn.

41:24.081 --> 41:25.514
See, the secret

41:25.517 --> 41:27.383
Is putting the syrup
in the batter.

41:28.653 --> 41:29.919
- Alright.
- After you.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.521
- Innovative.

41:31.623 --> 41:33.623
- I am nothing
if not innovative.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.859
- His name's rick.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.594
He twisted his knee snowshoeing,

41:38.697 --> 41:40.396
But that's not what
he came in for, he arrested--

41:40.498 --> 41:42.532
- Unless you're family
or tch staff,

41:42.633 --> 41:45.001
I can't share patient
information with you.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.469
- Oh, I get it, I get it.
Official, I get it.

41:47.472 --> 41:48.872
It's rules.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.776
Hey, I like your sweater.

41:53.778 --> 41:55.445
Those are nice colours.
Did you knit that?

41:55.447 --> 41:57.347
You know,
my auntie knits.

41:57.448 --> 42:00.482
- Look, I don't have time today
for whatever it is you're up to,

42:00.485 --> 42:02.018
So I'll make this simple.
- Okay.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.153
- Not happening.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.556
- Uh...

42:12.797 --> 42:16.633
Oh,I was just going
to use the washroom.

42:16.635 --> 42:18.401
You know,
you got to pee when you can.

42:18.503 --> 42:20.336
- They sent rick
to winnipeg for a bypass,

42:20.338 --> 42:22.472
And he'll snowshoeing
again next winter.

42:22.574 --> 42:24.507
(exhales)

42:24.609 --> 42:25.742
- Okay.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.978
- You were right,
by the way.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.315
Everyone does make mistakes
in the beginning, and I...

42:33.684 --> 42:35.351
I was too hard on you.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.121
Stuff like that,
people judging you

42:39.124 --> 42:40.990
Before you open your mouth,

42:40.992 --> 42:44.093
You'll always have to be better
than they expected.

42:44.095 --> 42:45.595
You'll always have to be better.

42:45.696 --> 42:48.598
- Yeah, see, that, right there.
This is why I didn't

42:48.600 --> 42:50.733
Tell you I cam back, crys.
This is why I didn't tell you

42:50.835 --> 42:52.434
I wanted to be a paramedic.
I knew you wouldn't

42:52.437 --> 42:54.337
Think I could do it.
- Jer, I never said...

42:54.438 --> 42:55.505
- This is why I left.

42:59.710 --> 43:01.578
- You left because of me?

43:04.749 --> 43:06.415
- I'm never going
to be good enough for you,

43:06.418 --> 43:07.850
Am I, crystal?

43:09.354 --> 43:11.421
You know, I'm working hard.

43:11.522 --> 43:13.856
I'm trying to push myself
to grow and learn,

43:13.958 --> 43:16.025
But you can't see that.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.228
No matter how much I try,
no matter how much I've changed.

43:19.230 --> 43:20.663
You haven't.

43:23.401 --> 43:24.867
You haven't changed at all.

43:28.306 --> 43:31.007
(emotional music)

43:40.185 --> 43:42.785
(tense music)

43:42.887 --> 44:10.146
Subtitling: Difuze
