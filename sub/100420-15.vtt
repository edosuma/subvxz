WEBVTT

00:17.350 --> 00:18.309
What you got there?

00:18.393 --> 00:20.061
I think it's a hydrangea.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.272
Does she even like that kind of plant?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.649
Probably not. She doesn't like anything.

00:24.941 --> 00:26.443
Hello, BoJack.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.944
Thanks for having me, Mom.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.612
You're the guest of honor.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.073
Everyone, BoJack is here.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.451
- Hey, buddy! Get in here!

00:34.534 --> 00:36.703
-For you.
-Oh, a plant.

00:36.786 --> 00:40.665
-Dirt for inside. Goody.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.726
You got here just in time, BoJack.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.394
A bird flew in through the window

01:43.478 --> 01:45.396
and we're having trouble
getting her out of the house.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.108
Yeah, call yourself early
and go get a worm!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.985
Golly, she's more coy
than a coyote claiming a cottontail.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.196
-Ahem. Phone for you, Mrs. Horseman.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.405
Thank you, butler.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.157
-Is that Zach Braff?
-Who?

01:56.241 --> 02:00.537
Zach Braff. Actor, independent filmmaker,
real-life friend of Donald Faison?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.747
-You mean my butler?
-At your service!

02:02.831 --> 02:04.999
I actually was friends with Donald
in real life.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.334
He's a spectacular man--

02:06.417 --> 02:08.711
-Butler!
-Sorry! Phone call for you.

02:08.795 --> 02:09.963
I'll take it in the kitchen.

02:10.046 --> 02:13.633
BoJack, make yourself useful for a change
and help, will ya?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.009
With the bird?

02:16.469 --> 02:18.471
Hello? Oh, it's you.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.850
All right. That does it!
Son of a--!

02:21.933 --> 02:22.976
With a drop like that,

02:23.059 --> 02:25.520
you'd think she was the ratings
for <i>Veronica's Closet</i>

02:25.603 --> 02:26.646
when it moved to Mondays.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.607
Ugh. Comedy poison.
Who wants to laugh on a Monday?

02:29.691 --> 02:33.027
BJ! Finally made it
to our little soirÃ©e, huh?

02:33.111 --> 02:35.363
Yeah, I kept having this dream
where I was having dinner

02:35.446 --> 02:38.783
with all the people who were gone
and I thought, "I should do that!"

02:38.867 --> 02:40.743
So, here I am.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.413
-We've got to flank her from the left.
- Huh?

02:43.496 --> 02:45.039
Hello. Crackerjack?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.375
-That's what it says on my underpants!

02:47.458 --> 02:50.461
The uncle I never met
and yet could never live up to!

02:50.545 --> 02:55.300
All right, soldier. Ready, aim...

02:55.383 --> 02:56.593
-Huh?

02:56.676 --> 02:58.052
Hey! What's up, man?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.847
Hey, Corduroy.  Good to...

03:00.930 --> 03:03.308
Still weirded out because the last time
you saw me I was naked,

03:03.391 --> 03:06.352
hanging from my iPhone charger,
holding a lemon, with a very erect penis

03:06.436 --> 03:09.480
despite being deceased in my trailer
for over an hour?

03:09.731 --> 03:10.565
Yep.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.567
You're gonna have to get over that, buddy.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.986
Hmm. Mm. Ooh.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.238
-What are you...? Stop that.
-Oh! Oh, sorry.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.948
Forgot where I was for a second.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.201
-Think this'll help?
-Kid's got the right idea.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.454
We can chuck the choker
and spook her with this poker!

03:25.246 --> 03:26.998
-Show her who's boss!
- Ruffle her feathers!

03:27.081 --> 03:28.541
Get her to the kitchen!

03:30.001 --> 03:31.127
And that!

03:32.837 --> 03:33.755
-All right!
- Go!

03:33.838 --> 03:34.881
Ha-cha!

03:39.844 --> 03:43.181
Yes, yes, BoJack bullied a bird.
Bully for him.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.474
Speaking of useless,

03:44.557 --> 03:47.185
my husband is running late,
so we're gonna start dinner without him.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.020
He'll be here before the show starts,
won't he?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.021
He'd better be.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.482
In the meantime,
let's adjourn to the dining room

03:52.565 --> 03:56.361
before our dinners get
as cold as my parenting style.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.406
I think mine would be

04:01.032 --> 04:02.909
the first time someone asked
for my autograph.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.118
-Really?
-Oh, wow!

04:04.202 --> 04:05.870
I didn't even know how to write my name!

04:05.954 --> 04:07.330
I just drew a squiggle!

04:07.413 --> 04:08.790
-Water?
-Thank you, Zach Braff.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.459
You only get to give
your first autograph once, you know.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.963
The second time it becomes an obligation,
the third time a chore.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.132
But the first time...
The first time...

04:18.216 --> 04:21.469
-Hey. What is that?
-Ah, ah, ah.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.137
Shh.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.140
- Mm.
-Okay. My turn.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.060
Mine was also when I signed
on a dotted line to enlist.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.939
Are you ready to sing "The Lollypop Song"
in the big show later?

04:33.022 --> 04:35.066
No, Mom.
You know I never make it to the show.

04:35.149 --> 04:38.820
I didn't know then that enlisting
would lead to my two worst parts.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.571
You have two?
I didn't know we could pick two.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.907
Corduroy, it's a conversation,
not an assignment.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.493
- In that case, I have three.
- Three is way too many.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.453
My worst parts were saying goodbye
to my mother

04:47.537 --> 04:49.789
and seeing a bullet go straight
through my general's face,

04:49.872 --> 04:51.124
right before it hit my own.

04:51.207 --> 04:54.294
-At least your death was instantaneous.

04:54.377 --> 04:58.715
I can still hear the loud drips of my IV
from when I had cancer.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.842
-Drip. Drip.
-Ooh.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.719
- What about you, BoJack?
-What?

05:02.802 --> 05:04.429
Best part, worst part, what about you?

05:04.512 --> 05:07.265
Well, I guess my worst part
has to be, um...

05:08.725 --> 05:11.853
Right before I got here, I think? Uh...

05:11.936 --> 05:14.480
I went to Angela Diaz's house.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.940
Ugh!

05:16.024 --> 05:18.234
Does anyone else's water
taste like chlorine?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.486
Hey, Braff, can I get
some different water over here?

05:20.570 --> 05:21.654
Right away, Mr. Horseman.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.115
Crackerjack, do you think your death
meant something

05:24.198 --> 05:26.868
because it was in the service
of a greater cause?

05:26.951 --> 05:28.619
-Aw, shucks.
-Of course it meant something.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.247
I think questions like that are too big
for a little soldier like me.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.374
My brother gave the ultimate sacrifice.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.127
-Because sometimes I wonder--
-But see, this is where I get hung up,

05:36.210 --> 05:39.047
because when we valorize
the idea of sacrifice,

05:39.130 --> 05:41.799
-of loss, of suffering--
-BoJack, don't start with this again.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.427
When we grow up
in a house that does that,

05:44.510 --> 05:48.348
we internalize this idea
that being happy is a selfish act,

05:48.431 --> 05:50.058
but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.726
- Yes, it does.
-Sacrifice?

05:51.809 --> 05:55.229
In the service of something greater,
maybe, but just in and of itself?

05:55.313 --> 05:56.773
-What's the good in that?
-A lot.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.191
Sacrifice is good.

05:58.274 --> 06:02.779
It has to be because I sacrificed a ton,
and I was freaking awesome.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.822
Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.199
I gave everything.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.533
I gave my whole life.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.744
You died in a hedonistic bender.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.412
I'm not talking about my death.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.750
I'm talking about my life.
I gave my whole life.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.294
If we get into everyone's whole life,
we're gonna be here all night.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.214
It's called "Best Part/Worst Part,"
not "Everything That Ever Happened."

06:21.297 --> 06:22.507
Okay, worst part:

06:22.590 --> 06:25.927
the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin Tour."

06:26.010 --> 06:29.013
My manager leaked nudes
to get more tour dates added,

06:29.097 --> 06:33.017
my mom pointed out every carb I ate,
it was hell.

06:33.101 --> 06:37.438
But it gave millions of fans
a show they will never forget.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.023
And that is worth something.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.817
No, that's a high you chase.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.194
-It was not.
-You think you singing songs on stage

06:43.277 --> 06:45.822
is the same thing as this guy
who died liberating the camps?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.282
We don't need to compare
apples to Auschwitzes.

06:48.366 --> 06:52.787
Herb, tell 'em. It means something--
the work we do, the joy we bring.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.372
It has to, right?

06:54.455 --> 06:57.875
Boy, I sure thought so.
I-I used to really believe in it.

06:57.959 --> 07:01.045
I mean, I was one "trapped in an airport
during a snowstorm

07:01.129 --> 07:03.965
on the eve of the dance championship
guest starring Gregory Hines" episode

07:04.048 --> 07:05.383
away from an Emmy.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.676
Then I lost it all.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.053
Ow! Seriously, is no one noticing
this leak?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.304
Fine, we'll get a bucket.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.723
-The drips are hitting me!
-Then you'll hold the bucket.

07:12.807 --> 07:13.724
But the funny thing is,

07:13.808 --> 07:16.978
it wasn't until I got fired
that I actually became myself.

07:17.061 --> 07:21.232
I was out of the closet. I was free.
I was authentically me.

07:21.315 --> 07:24.235
What does being authentic
have to do with anything?

07:24.318 --> 07:27.864
Well, when I wasn't hiding
behind some facade, I could be at peace.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.116
That's when I really got
into philanthropy.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.743
-Can I ask you something, Herb?
-Why do people say that?

07:32.827 --> 07:36.330
If you're asking it, then yes,
you can and you will and you just did.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.583
Yeah, why are we announcing our questions?

07:38.666 --> 07:42.086
-Yeah, what are these questions, royalty?

07:42.170 --> 07:45.548
Announcing King and Queen Query
of the Interrogative Isle.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.717
May I ask you how do you do?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.470
-Very well, thanks.
-Ah, bup, bup, bup!

07:50.553 --> 07:54.140
I didn't ask you yet.
I asked if I could ask you.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.975
Did you get pleasure
from your charity work?

07:56.058 --> 07:57.602
Like real, deep pleasure?

07:57.685 --> 07:59.896
It dwarfed every other joy in my life.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.815
Doesn't count then.
If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.901
And it's only good if it's selfless.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.903
Who made up that rule? I helped people.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.322
Who cares if it made me feel good, too?

08:09.405 --> 08:11.073
Feeling good is inherently selfish.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.868
If I'd given myself to Christ,
truly went down the path--

08:13.951 --> 08:17.955
I don't care for this talk of religion
in my house.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.958
If I wasn't constantly
trying to feel good, get it better,

08:21.083 --> 08:24.962
always looking for maximum pleasure...
That was my worst part.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.341
Well, one of the three worst parts.
Wait, actually, can I have four?

08:28.424 --> 08:31.677
Discovering you in your trailer
definitely cracks my top five.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.720
This is bullshit!

08:32.803 --> 08:36.307
I did a lot for a lot of people!
I was not a bad person.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.018
No one is accusing you
of being a bad person, Sarah Lynn.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.311
You are! You all are

08:40.394 --> 08:45.483
with your "being authentic"
and "charity work" and "killing Nazis."

08:45.566 --> 08:48.110
I actually never killed a Nazi.
All my kills were friendly fire.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.031
I also never liberated any camps.
I'm honestly not sure what I did.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.742
Here you go.
Your husband just pulled up, ma'am.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.370
Wait, Dad's here?
He's never made it to dinner before.

08:57.453 --> 09:00.998
-Hey, here's a question.
-Another question has arrived!

09:01.082 --> 09:04.919
Did any of you have a song of yours
played in outer space?

09:05.002 --> 09:07.129
Anyone? No. Just me? Oh.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.214
That's what I thought.

09:08.297 --> 09:13.219
My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)"
is making its way to Mars!

09:13.302 --> 09:15.513
That means something.
I will be remembered.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.599
-That has to mean something. I will be--

09:18.683 --> 09:20.268
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss the show?

09:20.351 --> 09:21.727
-Hey!
-There he is! There's our guy!

09:21.811 --> 09:22.645
-Dad!
-I...

09:22.728 --> 09:25.648
Oh, you didn't miss a thing.
It's not like we have anywhere to be.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.442
Why shouldn't we all bend ourselves
to your schedule?

09:28.526 --> 09:30.444
I already apologized. I was running.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.905
Yes. As always, running late,

09:32.989 --> 09:36.367
while I was running myself ragged
trying to get dinner on the table.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.202
-Yes, you helped.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.247
And now I'm running out of patience
for you running your mouth.

09:41.330 --> 09:44.166
And I'm running out the clock
until we both...

09:44.250 --> 09:46.502
Well. Here we are.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.046
I'll just squeeze in here.

09:50.631 --> 09:54.385
-Get yourself something nice.
-Ooh! Thank you, Mr. Secretariat.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.596
-What'd I miss?
-We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.556
Ooh! I got one! Machu Picchu.

09:58.639 --> 10:02.810
When I left "Horsin' Around,"
I honestly thought about killing myself.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.270
Shit, Herb. Really?

10:04.353 --> 10:06.522
Yeah. But the Knicks
were having a good season

10:06.606 --> 10:08.065
and I wanted to see what happened.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.317
Wait, you didn't kill yourself

10:09.400 --> 10:11.569
because the Knicks
were having a good season?

10:11.652 --> 10:13.946
What would you have done
if they were having a bad season?

10:14.030 --> 10:15.823
I don't know. Gotten into baseball?

10:15.906 --> 10:18.409
Oh, for the love...
Where's your follow-through?

10:18.492 --> 10:20.369
It's like you didn't even
wanna kill yourself!

10:20.453 --> 10:21.704
And I'm so glad I didn't.

10:21.787 --> 10:25.166
Because there I was ten years later
at Machu Picchu

10:25.249 --> 10:30.004
and I realized there was so much more
I could do in a life.

10:30.087 --> 10:30.963
Okay, my turn.

10:31.047 --> 10:36.010
August 22nd, 1973,
I was banned from running ever again.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.846
And running, well, that was the only thing
that ever made sense to me,

10:38.929 --> 10:42.099
-so if I couldn't do that I was nobody.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.852
-This is your worst part?
-Best part: jumping off that bridge.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.647
-Jesus.
-What did I say about the Jesus talk?

10:47.730 --> 10:50.024
It was my choice.
I got to go on my own terms.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.275
Not a lot of people can say that.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.693
-No.
-That's true.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.403
The view from up there.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.114
-Eh, you wouldn't believe it.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.533
-Oh, my.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.372
-It must've been from swimming earlier.
-Oh, you were swimming?

11:04.455 --> 11:06.415
Yeah. I, um...

11:06.499 --> 11:08.125
-When was I swimming?
-Don't think about that.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.795
-Do you have a best part?
-Oh, uh, I don't know.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.546
This past year I took a teaching job.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.216
And I had this one student
who was really struggling,

11:15.299 --> 11:16.759
just couldn't get over this hump.

11:16.842 --> 11:20.638
And what, you helped him
do good in a scene? For your class?

11:20.721 --> 11:22.682
That's the best part of your whole life?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.433
I don't know, I was just spitballing.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.352
I didn't know you were gonna put me
on the spot like this!

11:26.435 --> 11:29.063
Come on, buddy.
What was so special about that moment?

11:29.146 --> 11:31.649
It felt good to help someone do something.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.359
See? Helping someone, like I said!

11:33.442 --> 11:36.946
But he liked it because it felt good,
like I said!

11:37.029 --> 11:41.075
I liked it because it reminded me
of when I was young, just starting out.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.244
You and me, screwing around,
hitting up open mics.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.037
Trying to figure it out. I think...

11:45.329 --> 11:47.581
-I think that was the best part.
-Really?

11:47.665 --> 11:50.000
Well, are we ready to start the show?

11:50.084 --> 11:52.336
- Let's do this!
-Okay, nice seeing you all!

11:52.420 --> 11:53.379
You're not coming?

11:53.462 --> 11:56.298
This is always the part where I wake up.
You all go to the show.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.050
Zach Braff says "Pardon my reach"

11:58.134 --> 12:00.511
even though he can clearly
get my plate from another angle.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.722
-Then I wake up.
-Oh, okay.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.892
-Next time then.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.394
Pardon my reach.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.605
Hmm.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.573
Hello, everyone!
Please take your seats.

12:22.158 --> 12:26.912
Tonight's show is in honor
of BoJack Horseman!

12:27.455 --> 12:30.040
What do you say, huh?
Should we get this show started?

12:30.124 --> 12:33.002
Yeah! Tonight's opener
needs no introduction,

12:33.085 --> 12:34.462
but I'm gonna give her one anyway.

12:34.545 --> 12:38.507
Ladies and gentlemen,
the one, the only, Sarah Lynn!

12:38.591 --> 12:41.177
-Thank you, thank you!

12:41.260 --> 12:47.099
I'd like to dedicate tonight's performance
to the man of the hour, BoJack Horseman!

12:48.642 --> 12:52.104
Sarah Lynn, I'm so sorry
for everything that happened with you.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.939
With us. I should have protected you...

12:54.023 --> 12:56.233
Ah, ah, ah. BoJack. This is my time.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.444
Yes. Of course. Sorry.

13:03.741 --> 13:08.704
<i>âª Life is a never-ending show, old sport âª</i>

13:08.788 --> 13:13.459
<i>âª Except the minor detail that it ends âª</i>

13:14.251 --> 13:19.465
<i>âª The overture's a lifetime</i>
<i>But the show is short âª</i>

13:19.548 --> 13:24.637
<i>âª Here with all your family and friends âª</i>

13:24.887 --> 13:26.931
<i>âª You run the race</i>
<i>You blurt your lines âª</i>

13:27.014 --> 13:29.141
<i>âª They put your face</i>
<i>On shirts and shrines âª</i>

13:29.225 --> 13:33.604
<i>âª And giant signs a thousand feet tall âª</i>

13:33.687 --> 13:37.691
<i>âª And don't stop dancing</i>
<i>Don't stop dancing âª</i>

13:37.775 --> 13:41.779
<i>âª 'Til the curtain call âª</i>

13:44.949 --> 13:48.160
<i>âª Shows are a never-ending life</i>
<i>Of course âª</i>

13:48.244 --> 13:51.497
<i>âª A silhouette that stays</i>
<i>When you are gone âª</i>

13:51.580 --> 13:54.917
<i>âª What use is the struggle</i>
<i>And the strife, old horse? âª</i>

13:55.000 --> 13:57.837
<i>âª End it and your legacy lives on âª</i>

14:00.714 --> 14:04.635
<i>âª The chatter stops</i>
<i>The crowd departs âª</i>

14:04.718 --> 14:08.764
<i>âª A needle drops, the music starts âª</i>

14:09.265 --> 14:14.061
<i>âª A song you taught me when I was small âª</i>

14:16.355 --> 14:20.401
<i>âª Don't stop dancing âª</i>

14:20.484 --> 14:25.739
<i>âª Don't stop dancing âª</i>

14:31.495 --> 14:33.163
Sarah Lynn? Sarah Lynn!

14:33.247 --> 14:36.792
Okay, performing
an interpretive aerial routine,

14:36.876 --> 14:39.753
your friend and mine,
and a killer hang...

14:39.837 --> 14:44.258
-...Corduroy Jackson-Jackson!

14:44.425 --> 14:45.801
-Where did Sarah Lynn go?
-Shh.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.803
-Try to enjoy the show.
- Ha!

14:48.512 --> 14:51.307
-Where does this door go?
-Sit down, buddy. You'll get your turn.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.350
-No, I need you to tell me-- What?
-Watch out!

14:57.855 --> 15:01.275
That's a series wrap
on Corduroy Jackson-Jackson!

15:01.358 --> 15:02.902
Down in front, please?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.612
All right,
let's keep this show going, huh?

15:04.695 --> 15:06.196
Next up, you know him, you love him,

15:06.280 --> 15:08.657
please a give a warm, warm,
burning hot welcome to...

15:08.741 --> 15:11.243
-Hey. You wanna grab a smoke?
-...Zach Braff!

15:11.327 --> 15:14.038
-Yes. Yeah, let's get out of here.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.458
Oh-ho, whee! I'm honored.
Honored, honored.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.377
So, what's on the other side of that door?

15:20.461 --> 15:22.838
The nerve of that guy.
With the beard. Herb?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.006
Yeah. Herb.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.926
What, he says he's at peace?
'Cause why, Machu Picchu?

15:27.009 --> 15:29.303
-I don't buy it.
-I don't know. I... I believe him.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.180
I promise you,
every single person in that room

15:31.263 --> 15:32.723
would go back if we could.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.351
Peace? That's someone
trying to convince himself of something.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.979
-Of what?
-That life has meaning or purpose, that...

15:39.063 --> 15:41.190
that if you check the right boxes
and do the dance,

15:41.273 --> 15:42.983
then you get a little parting gift
at the end,

15:43.067 --> 15:46.987
a framed certificate that says,
"Congratulations, you've got peace."

15:48.238 --> 15:50.282
-I wouldn't mind that.
-But guess what?

15:50.366 --> 15:51.909
All the time those people spent,

15:51.992 --> 15:55.245
trying to do good or help people
or be something?

15:55.329 --> 15:58.791
I did none of that shit,
and yet here I am, same as them.

15:58.874 --> 16:02.169
You were the fastest runner in the world.
You inspired millions.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.713
And yet, here I am, same as you.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.800
So, if you could go back, do it again,
what would you do different?

16:07.967 --> 16:10.886
What would I do?
I wouldn't have cared so much.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.930
Cared about what? Racing?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.348
About everything.

16:14.431 --> 16:17.101
I know this part is confusing
because I'm Secretariat

16:17.184 --> 16:19.269
and also your dad for some reason,

16:19.353 --> 16:23.649
but speaking as your dad,
it's important that you know that I cared.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.193
No. You never cared.
You cared about your book.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.361
You cared about getting drunk

16:27.444 --> 16:28.862
and telling everyone
how miserable you were,

16:28.946 --> 16:30.114
but that's not caring.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.741
You think I didn't care
because I put up walls,

16:32.825 --> 16:34.618
but I cared so much, BoJack.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.329
About you, about your mother.

16:37.496 --> 16:41.083
I wanted you to respect me.
I wanted you to love me.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.419
I was so afraid that you would know that.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.255
I cared so much.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.676
It's a shame that we could never
talk like this in real life.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.261
All the good it would have done.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.888
Least we got the chance this time,
before I wake up.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.517
Wake up?
Oh, you're not getting it, are you?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.768
Getting what?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.819
Loss is a collaborative art,

17:08.902 --> 17:11.947
between the people who leave us
and those who remain.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.409
We dance with the shadows
of their absence.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.746
-With that in mind, I present to you...
- Stop the show!

17:18.829 --> 17:20.456
-Excuse me.
-What's happening?

17:20.539 --> 17:24.501
You're being very rude.
I was about to do my roller-dance routine.

17:24.793 --> 17:28.088
-Calm down, son.
-Yes, why don't you sit down, and--

17:28.172 --> 17:29.965
-No!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no. Please!

17:30.049 --> 17:32.718
I'm not ready. I never got to direct
my <i>Backdraft</i> remake:

17:32.801 --> 17:34.386
"Zach Braff's Backdraft"!

17:34.470 --> 17:35.721
I never finished my memoir:

17:35.804 --> 17:38.640
"I Started A Zach Which Started
The Whole World Braffing!"

17:38.724 --> 17:39.767
I never got to license

17:39.850 --> 17:42.644
the Zach Braff Short Stack
Breakfast Attack at Shake Shack!

17:42.728 --> 17:45.731
Cash-strapped hash brown fans
who hashtag "Zach's snacks"

17:45.814 --> 17:49.860
get cash back fast
with the Braff Bucks app!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
I need to wake up. I can't be here.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.783
Of course. Everything's always about you.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.786
-BJ, buddy...
-Herb! How did I get here?

17:58.869 --> 17:59.995
How the hell should I know?

18:00.079 --> 18:03.373
I broke into my house.
But it wasn't my house anymore.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.542
I was... I was watching
the "Horsin' Around" Blu-ray.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.170
Yes. Yeah, and I drank some more
and I found some pills.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.922
And then I went swimming...

18:10.130 --> 18:12.591
No! No! No! No, wait, wait, wait!
I got out of the pool.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.009
Yes! And I called Diane!

18:14.093 --> 18:15.844
BoJack, we're trying to do a show here.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.929
But I called Diane.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.014
I couldn't have drowned
if I got out of the pool to call Diane!

18:19.098 --> 18:20.015
So, I shouldn't be here.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.143
If I could just finish
the conversation. Where's a phone?!

18:26.939 --> 18:29.733
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a real treat for you next.

18:29.817 --> 18:30.651
A real treat.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.820
Come and see him
before he makes a run for it.

18:32.903 --> 18:36.115
-No! Stop!
-It's Secretariat!

18:36.198 --> 18:38.826
Stay calm. Flyin' off the handle
won't change a thing.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.286
This was gonna happen to you
one of these days.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.831
A poem. Original, obviously.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.793
It's called "The View from Halfway Down."

18:47.876 --> 18:51.755
"The weak breeze whispers nothing
The water screams sublime

18:51.839 --> 18:55.843
His feet shift teeter-totter
Deep breath, stand back, it's time

18:55.926 --> 18:59.304
Toes untouch the overpass
Soon he's water bound

18:59.388 --> 19:03.559
Eyes locked shut but peek to see
The view from halfway down"

19:05.853 --> 19:09.481
I'm not done. Hold on. I'm not done.
I'm not done.

19:10.524 --> 19:14.611
"A little wind, a summer sun
A river rich and regal

19:14.695 --> 19:18.699
A flood of fond endorphins
Brings a calm that knows no equal

19:18.782 --> 19:20.033
You're flying now

19:20.117 --> 19:22.578
You see things much more clear
Than from the ground

19:22.661 --> 19:27.166
It's all okay, it would be
Were you not now halfway down

19:29.126 --> 19:31.044
Thrash to break from gravity

19:31.837 --> 19:34.173
What now could slow the drop?

19:34.298 --> 19:37.801
All I'd give for toes to touch
The safety back at top"

19:37.885 --> 19:40.762
I change my mind.
I change my mind. I don't wanna--

19:40.846 --> 19:42.264
It's okay.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.267
"But this is it, the deed is done

19:45.350 --> 19:47.561
Silence drowns the sound

19:47.644 --> 19:50.814
Before I leaped I should have seen
The view from halfway down

19:50.898 --> 19:55.569
No! I really should have thought
About the view from halfway down"

19:55.652 --> 19:58.906
Find your peace, big guy. Find it.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.659
"I wish I could have known
About the view from halfway down--"

20:04.828 --> 20:06.371
I need to get out of here!

20:09.082 --> 20:10.876
-Wha--
-BJ, where do you think you're going?

20:10.959 --> 20:12.419
Nothing you do in here matters, pal.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.797
Yelling and struggling isn't gonna
pull your body out of that pool,

20:15.881 --> 20:19.801
-so you might as well just--
-Sit down!

20:19.885 --> 20:20.802
But I...

20:20.886 --> 20:24.306
Look, BJ, it's possible that someone
is going to find you and save you,

20:24.389 --> 20:26.808
and it's also possible that someone won't.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.143
We don't get to know.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.353
Can I ask you a question?

20:31.521 --> 20:34.024
Has anyone ever come back from this place?

20:35.651 --> 20:38.070
BJ, there is no place.

20:38.153 --> 20:42.491
It's just your brain going through
what it feels like it has to go through.

20:42.574 --> 20:46.370
All you can do right now
is sit back and enjoy the show.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.582
Folks, here is Beatrice Horseman

20:50.666 --> 20:53.919
with her younger older brother,
Crackerjack!

21:11.687 --> 21:12.688
Hoo!

21:20.404 --> 21:23.573
This is the hard part.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.076
Golly.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.123
And now the easy part.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.542
Over and out!

21:47.014 --> 21:48.640
Wow. Beatrice Horseman, huh?

21:48.724 --> 21:50.559
You know, she was gonna sing
for us tonight,

21:50.642 --> 21:52.978
but apparently, she was a little "horse."

21:54.896 --> 21:57.107
Okay. You ready for the headliner?

21:57.190 --> 21:58.483
-No.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.610
-Please welcome to the stage...

22:00.694 --> 22:01.653
No. Please.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.947
The star of "Horsin' Around"

22:04.698 --> 22:09.536
and "The BoJack Horseman Show"!
"Philbert"! "Secretariat"!

22:09.619 --> 22:11.872
The upcoming "Horny Unicorn"!

22:11.955 --> 22:14.374
Son of Butterscotch and Beatrice!

22:14.458 --> 22:19.629
Husband to no one! Father to none,
that we know of!

22:19.713 --> 22:21.840
Stand-up comedian, actor,

22:21.923 --> 22:23.759
crippling alcoholic!

22:23.842 --> 22:29.639
A talented charmer
and a stupid piece of shit.

22:29.723 --> 22:33.643
It's... BoJack Horseman!

22:39.691 --> 22:41.860
Is it terrifying?

22:42.110 --> 22:44.196
No. I don't think so.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.114
It's the way it is, you know?

22:46.365 --> 22:50.869
Everything must come to an end,
the drip finally stops.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.246
See you on the other side.

22:53.538 --> 22:57.584
Oh, BoJack, no, there is no other side.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.461
This is it.

23:03.131 --> 23:07.427
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:07.511 --> 23:11.431
-I... I need to make a phone call.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.729
-Hello?

23:18.605 --> 23:20.774
Someone? Anyone?

23:28.907 --> 23:30.325
I'm looking for a phone.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.758
Diane! Diane! Are you there?
Diane! I need you!

23:46.842 --> 23:48.593
- <i>BoJack?</i>
<i>-</i>Diane! Thank God!

23:48.677 --> 23:51.721
Thank God, Diane. Okay, Diane.
Diane, you're gonna save me, right?

23:51.805 --> 23:53.348
I called you
and you're coming to get me?

23:53.432 --> 23:57.602
<i>BoJack, why did you call me?</i>
<i>I live in Chicago. I can't save you.</i>

23:57.686 --> 24:00.063
-You didn't pick up.
<i>-Right.</i>

24:00.147 --> 24:02.732
-It went to voicemail.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

24:03.066 --> 24:06.278
And then... I went back in the pool.

24:09.573 --> 24:13.201
<i>-It's too late. What's done is done.</i>
-No.

24:13.285 --> 24:18.206
<i>There's nothing I can do, BoJack.</i>
<i>I'm not real. None of this is.</i>

24:18.457 --> 24:22.169
-So, what do I do now?
<i>-BoJack, it doesn't matter.</i>

24:22.252 --> 24:26.381
Well, if it doesn't matter,
can I stay on the phone with you at least?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.008
<i>Okay.</i>

24:29.509 --> 24:30.760
How was your day?

24:31.678 --> 24:33.847
<i>-Good.</i>
-Yeah?

24:34.431 --> 24:38.059
<i>Yeah. My day was good.</i>
