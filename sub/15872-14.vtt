00:01.708 --> 00:04.583
[Emma]  A few months ago,
I discovered I had
a twin sister

00:04.583 --> 00:06.792
and then she asked me
to take her place.

00:06.792 --> 00:10.041
Keep the secret,
find our real mother
and try to stay alive.

00:11.125 --> 00:13.500
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.583
How long could you keep up
the lying game?

00:16.583 --> 00:17.750
[Ethan]  Previously on
The Lying Game...

00:17.750 --> 00:20.000
Someone tried to kill me!

00:20.000 --> 00:22.041
They could be watching us
right now
and Emma is in danger.

00:22.041 --> 00:23.959
Until we figure out
who did this.

00:23.959 --> 00:26.458
We were all thinking
Annie Hobbs had
something to do with it.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.834
Our mother was the one
who saved my life.

00:28.834 --> 00:31.667
Ryan Harwell, rich, snotty,
entitled. You hate him.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.667
[Mads]  Look, the ballet
is next week

00:33.667 --> 00:36.166
and if you'd have any
desire to go with me...

00:36.166 --> 00:38.333
That's great.

00:38.333 --> 00:41.083
We could start fresh
and see where it takes us.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.959
-Your dad killed my mom.
-What?

00:42.959 --> 00:44.667
She was one of his patients.
He screwed up.

00:44.667 --> 00:46.125
She was supposed to be fine.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.959
We really need to get you
out of here.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.083
Sutton!
Sutton, what's going on?

00:52.208 --> 00:53.417
Oh, my God.

00:53.417 --> 00:54.875
I just fell and hit my head.

00:54.875 --> 00:56.625
You sure you got that tonight?

00:56.625 --> 00:58.500
Well, I just
heal very quickly.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.834
God, I love my bed!

01:06.625 --> 01:08.708
And my cushy mattress,

01:08.708 --> 01:12.500
my three zillion
thread-count sheets.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.000
You're in a good mood.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.750
How do you feel about
chocolate-banana pancakes?

01:17.542 --> 01:19.250
-Ugh.
-Okay.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.667
But you've been a little lax
on the whole diet thing
lately. I just thought...

01:22.667 --> 01:25.125
Well, all the more reason to
get back into fighting shape.

01:25.125 --> 01:27.125
Well, I hope it's not
because you're worried about

01:27.125 --> 01:28.750
fitting into this.

01:30.917 --> 01:33.041
I know white chiffon
can be so unforgiving

01:33.041 --> 01:35.125
but you'll look amazing in it.

01:35.125 --> 01:37.083
And I'm sure everyone else
will be wearing black.

01:38.834 --> 01:39.792
The black and white ball.

01:40.542 --> 01:41.959
I almost forgot.

01:41.959 --> 01:43.875
It's kinda like
your initiation

01:43.875 --> 01:46.417
as a full-fledged
junior member of the club.

01:46.417 --> 01:47.792
And now I have to go
wearing that.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.583
Hmm.

01:50.708 --> 01:52.208
You like this dress.

01:52.208 --> 01:54.625
"Very Audrey Hepburn."
Isn't that what you said?

01:55.417 --> 01:56.959
Did I? Hmm.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.250
It's just so plain.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.000
Hey, $300 worth of plain.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.625
It's just not really me.

02:09.959 --> 02:12.125
Well, how about this?

02:12.125 --> 02:16.041
The programs arrived, too.
All the junior members
and their escorts.

02:19.917 --> 02:21.708
"Ethan Whitehorse."

02:23.375 --> 02:24.500
Now, that I like.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.500
I'll take the dress,
and I'll make it work.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.166
Thank you.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.000
What are you doing?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.125
Are you trying to get caught?

02:44.125 --> 02:45.291
My mom and dad
were right there.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.291
I'm sorry.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.792
I fell asleep at the trailer
and Dan came in early
from his night shift

02:50.792 --> 02:51.875
and so I had to run.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.625
I didn't know
where else to go.

02:54.625 --> 02:55.875
How about the mall?

02:55.875 --> 02:57.291
You seem to have
that place on lockdown.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.291
You got the dress.

03:00.959 --> 03:02.708
Yes, I got the dress.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.500
And let me guess.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.333
You just had to go to
the black and white ball

03:07.333 --> 03:10.000
and you had to take
Ethan as your escort.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.834
Kind of.

03:11.834 --> 03:14.125
-What was I supposed to do?
-I get it.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.458
[sighs] It's just that
it feels like homecoming
all over again.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.458
Anyway, now that I'm here

03:19.458 --> 03:21.000
I guess I can go to my
own black and white ball.

03:21.708 --> 03:22.708
With Ethan.

03:22.708 --> 03:23.750
Okay,

03:24.834 --> 03:26.041
but where am I
supposed to live?

03:27.333 --> 03:29.166
Maybe I can camp out in your
closet or something.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.708
No.

03:30.708 --> 03:33.333
It isn't safe
for either of us.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.417
Somebody broke in here
last night and there's
a killer out there.

03:35.417 --> 03:37.250
What do you want me to do?

03:38.792 --> 03:40.708
I don't know, Emma.

03:40.708 --> 03:42.125
But if we both want
to stay alive

03:42.125 --> 03:43.375
you need to find
someplace else to go.

03:47.542 --> 03:48.458
♪ Uh ♪

03:57.542 --> 03:59.375
♪ Uh, uh-uh ♪

03:59.375 --> 04:02.208
♪ Uh, uh-uh, uh ♪

04:02.208 --> 04:03.959
♪ Watch out for this girl ♪

04:03.959 --> 04:06.542
♪ She's got a gun
for a tongue ♪

04:07.708 --> 04:09.250
I mean, how about
a hotel, or...

04:11.000 --> 04:12.625
Maybe you should
just go back to Vegas.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.417
Oh...

04:16.417 --> 04:18.125
You're not just kicking
me out of your house,

04:18.125 --> 04:19.291
you're kicking me
out of your life.

04:19.917 --> 04:21.000
No, it's not like that.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.125
Look, after the attack, I...

04:23.583 --> 04:24.959
[sighs]

04:24.959 --> 04:27.000
I'd never be able
to forgive myself

04:27.000 --> 04:28.583
if something happened to you

04:28.583 --> 04:29.834
and no one was there
to save you

04:30.625 --> 04:31.792
like Annie saved me.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.458
[knocking on door]

04:34.458 --> 04:35.417
[Laurel] Sutton...

04:37.333 --> 04:38.375
[sighs]

04:41.917 --> 04:43.625
Sorry, I know it's
pick-an-outfit crunch time

04:43.625 --> 04:44.959
but my head is spinning.

04:44.959 --> 04:46.458
I really need to
talk to someone.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.291
It's fine. Make it fast.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.875
Okay, well...

04:51.417 --> 04:52.458
Justin said some

04:53.417 --> 04:55.834
really messed-up
stuff last night.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.291
Justin?

04:57.291 --> 04:59.000
Hello, head wound!
My boyfriend.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.542
Oh, right, of course.

05:00.542 --> 05:03.166
This is serious and crazy.

05:03.166 --> 05:05.333
And I don't even know
if I believe any of it, but,

05:06.625 --> 05:08.333
Justin said our whole
relationship was fake.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.834
Or at least that it
started that way because

05:11.625 --> 05:12.625
he came here
looking for Dad.

05:14.458 --> 05:17.542
And he wanted to hurt
his family and hurt him.

05:18.542 --> 05:19.542
What are you talking about?

05:20.792 --> 05:22.125
Justin said Dad killed his mom

05:23.208 --> 05:24.250
on the operating table.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.291
A mistake, I guess.

05:28.667 --> 05:31.583
[sighs] Dad got a call
and got distracted

05:31.583 --> 05:33.875
and he left the surgery and
let some intern finish up.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.583
So...

05:36.583 --> 05:39.208
What, Justin was dating you
for revenge?

05:40.333 --> 05:42.375
That's crazy.
Have you asked Dad?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.500
I can't.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.708
Laurel, I think
you have to.

05:46.708 --> 05:49.291
You have to tell Dad and Mom
and probably the police.

05:49.291 --> 05:50.500
No, stop! If I do,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.333
there's no going back, okay?

05:52.333 --> 05:53.834
Justin said that
everything's changed

05:53.834 --> 05:55.542
and he fell in love
with me for real.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.750
I don't care.
He's a crazy person.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.834
Just stop, okay?
Please, just give me
a little bit of time

05:59.834 --> 06:01.333
because I need to figure out
how I feel.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.750
So, just don't tell anyone.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.583
[school bell ringing]

06:06.417 --> 06:08.917
Crazy outfit. You look gorge.

06:08.917 --> 06:11.417
Thanks. Thought I'd
shake it up a little bit.

06:11.417 --> 06:12.834
-Well, you're shaking it,
that's for sure.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:12.834 --> 06:13.917
Hey, Mads.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.041
Hey. Question.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.125
How do you feel
about escargot?

06:19.125 --> 06:21.333
Snails, I know,

06:21.333 --> 06:24.041
but they really do
taste just like chicken.

06:24.041 --> 06:25.625
Plus, you get to use
those little forks which...

06:25.625 --> 06:27.000
Ryan, what are you doing?

06:28.250 --> 06:30.542
There's a new French bistro
in the Ambassador Hotel.

06:30.542 --> 06:32.792
It's... It's kind of fancy,
but I figure we'll be

06:32.792 --> 06:34.166
dressed up
for the ballet anyway.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.291
Ryan's taking me
to see Cinderella.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.375
Men in tights,
but what can I say?

06:39.542 --> 06:41.208
I'm just hoping
the glass slipper fits.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.917
Ryan Harwell?
Have you lost your mind?

06:47.917 --> 06:49.667
Do you not remember
ninth grade?

06:49.667 --> 06:54.041
Of course, but he does
seem to have grown
a couple inches since then.

06:54.041 --> 06:57.708
'Cause his pre-pubescent gnome
syndrome was his only problem.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.250
It's one date to a ballet
I'm really dying to see.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.583
I'll take you to the ballet.
You don't have to
stoop to that.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.125
I'm not stooping.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.750
Yeah, 'cause he's grown.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.750
-I heard.
-What is with you?

07:07.750 --> 07:09.083
Yesterday you were
pushing me back into

07:09.083 --> 07:11.125
the dating pool, saying
"People change. He's cute."

07:12.375 --> 07:14.208
Well, a lot's changed
since yesterday.

07:15.417 --> 07:16.834
Hey, are you okay?

07:18.041 --> 07:19.583
As okay as I could
possibly be

07:19.583 --> 07:21.375
after my world's been
flipped upside down.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.667
I'm... I'm sorry.

07:25.667 --> 07:28.667
I love you, and I'm
telling you the truth.

07:28.667 --> 07:32.250
Now. But how can you
expect me to just
accept the fact that

07:32.250 --> 07:34.625
the entire beginning of our
relationship was a lie?

07:35.041 --> 07:36.000
[sighs]

07:38.333 --> 07:39.625
Why pick me, not Sutton?

07:41.583 --> 07:43.250
Admit it.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.542
You thought I'd be
an easier mark.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.750
That's not true.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.125
Look me in the eye
and try that again.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.291
[school bell ringing]

07:53.291 --> 07:54.667
Forget it.
I gotta get to class.

08:03.041 --> 08:05.333
Hi, boyfriend.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.625
I guess we should
hold hands, right?

08:07.291 --> 08:08.333
Get over here.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.333
So you put Emma
out on the street?

08:13.333 --> 08:15.458
[chuckles] Is that
how she described it?

08:15.458 --> 08:18.458
Please, I am trying to
keep us alive.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.041
Okay, good. Well, that's why
I'm moving her
into your family's cabin.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.834
-Why are you doing this?
-I got caught
with a cut on my head

08:25.834 --> 08:27.333
which, by the way,
my father insists

08:27.333 --> 08:28.708
on checking every night
until it heals.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.959
As much as I would love to
be the one to go into hiding,

08:34.166 --> 08:35.875
I just have to keep being me,
keep up appearances.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.166
Speaking of appearances...

08:39.166 --> 08:41.458
[chuckles] Yeah, no thanks.

08:41.458 --> 08:42.750
You're gonna have to find
somebody else.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.959
Yeah, it doesn't
work that way.

08:43.959 --> 08:45.542
See, your name right here?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.041
In print.

08:49.041 --> 08:50.291
Well, it's not like
it's in blood.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.125
[sighs] Look...

08:54.375 --> 08:56.542
This could be
my chance to

08:57.583 --> 08:58.917
make things right.

08:58.917 --> 09:01.708
It was a huge mistake keeping
you my secret boyfriend.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.792
So, think of this as
a coming-out party for us.

09:05.792 --> 09:07.542
What planet are you on?

09:07.542 --> 09:10.917
Emma and I have been out
for a long time now.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.542
She's the one who put
my name on that list,

09:12.542 --> 09:14.166
who wanted me there.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.333
Well, then if you were
willing to go with Emma

09:16.333 --> 09:17.750
you have to go with me.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.250
-Why?
-Someone is watching.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.834
And someone tried to kill me

09:21.834 --> 09:23.625
so we have to act like
nothing has changed.

09:25.375 --> 09:26.417
[sighs]

09:30.375 --> 09:31.583
She just wants
to get rid of me.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.417
And this surprises
you because?

09:35.875 --> 09:36.959
[sighs] Well...

09:38.667 --> 09:41.750
I mean, is she even trying
to figure out who broke
into the house

09:42.417 --> 09:45.041
or who tried to kill her

09:45.041 --> 09:47.083
or what happened
to our birth mother?

09:47.083 --> 09:48.542
Well, if she's not into
figuring it out

09:48.542 --> 09:50.000
maybe we shouldn't be either.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.375
What do you mean?

09:51.375 --> 09:53.792
I mean, maybe we just stick
with our original plan.

09:53.792 --> 09:56.291
We get out of town
like we wanted to do
before she reappeared.

09:56.875 --> 09:57.875
Where would we go?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.417
There's this lake,

10:00.417 --> 10:02.375
Canandaigua.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.333
My grandfather used to take
me there when I was a kid,

10:06.083 --> 10:09.333
whenever things got
bad with my father.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.458
You never talk about him.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.291
It's not much to tell.

10:13.750 --> 10:17.583
But there's a reason
I left the reservation

10:17.583 --> 10:18.458
and moved in
with my brother.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.291
But anyway...

10:22.083 --> 10:22.917
I love that lake.

10:24.542 --> 10:25.375
I want you to see it.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.458
God, I love you.

10:31.834 --> 10:32.917
But?

10:33.959 --> 10:35.000
But...

10:36.583 --> 10:38.333
[sighs] I can't leave.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.041
That note.

10:41.959 --> 10:43.583
Ethan, someone did try
to kill her.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.750
Thayer will be here.

10:48.792 --> 10:50.500
He can protect her.
He'd love to.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, I know, he can.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.667
But he can't take her
to the dance.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.834
You and I have been
such a couple that if

10:57.834 --> 10:59.166
Sutton shows up with Thayer,

11:00.083 --> 11:02.834
it's gonna look suspicious.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.083
She's my sister.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.708
Please.

11:11.667 --> 11:12.708
Do it for me.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.166
[Mads]
Isn't the black and white
ball enough?

11:20.166 --> 11:22.500
I don't get why we have
to have a pre-lunch, too.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.375
You know, most girls would
wanna stretch this moment

11:24.375 --> 11:25.250
as long as possible.

11:26.834 --> 11:28.291
Well, thanks for
going with me.

11:29.375 --> 11:31.834
I decided that taking
my brother as my escort

11:31.834 --> 11:34.500
is old-fashioned,
not pathetic.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.417
Hey, there's nothing
pathetic about you.

11:37.834 --> 11:40.333
But it's not too late
to change your mind.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.959
Yeah, well, it might be
too late to find somebody
equally not pathetic.

11:42.959 --> 11:43.959
What about Ryan Harwell?

11:44.875 --> 11:46.875
Oh, my God, again?

11:46.875 --> 11:48.750
You have the biggest
man crush on that guy.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.250
[laughs]
I'm just saying he's...

11:51.250 --> 11:53.375
He's good-looking,
he probably owns a tux,

11:53.375 --> 11:55.041
and he's really
into you, so...

11:55.041 --> 11:56.834
Which is why I'm letting him
take me to the ballet.

11:56.834 --> 11:58.500
Why not let him take you
to this?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.542
Because it's
the black and white ball.

12:00.542 --> 12:01.834
I'm gonna have these
pictures forever.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.834
I don't wanna look
back and think,
"Who the hell was that?"

12:03.834 --> 12:06.041
Oh, okay, so, you'd rather
look back and say

12:06.041 --> 12:07.583
"I didn't have the guts
to take a chance

12:07.583 --> 12:09.083
"on anyone except my brother"?

12:09.083 --> 12:10.875
[Alec] Sorry, I'm late.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.667
-Got hung up at the office.
You ready?
-Yeah.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.208
What about you, Dad?
Who are you
taking to this thing?

12:15.208 --> 12:16.291
Who's your date?

12:17.500 --> 12:18.917
Come on, Maddie.

12:18.917 --> 12:21.166
You know I'm the original
one-man wolf pack.

12:21.166 --> 12:22.625
I travel to
these things alone.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.667
Well, maybe it's time to
add somebody to the pack.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.333
-You got somebody in mind?
-Actually, yeah, I do.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.875
-Rebecca Sewell.
-[sputters]

12:31.875 --> 12:33.708
I saw you flirting at
the ballet benefit.

12:33.708 --> 12:34.917
-What?
-What?

12:34.917 --> 12:36.542
-What?
-How did I miss this?

12:36.542 --> 12:38.834
-My God, Dad,
are you blushing?
-No.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.041
-You so are.
-No!

12:41.792 --> 12:42.834
Hi.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.417
I figured bagels
would travel.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.250
Wasn't really sure which kind
you're in the mood for

12:48.250 --> 12:49.125
so, I just got
one of everything.

12:50.041 --> 12:52.041
You didn't by any
chance bring me coffee?

12:52.875 --> 12:54.500
Coffee?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.875
It's a little harder
to carry on a bike.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.291
Luckily, I am
a hell of a rider.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.291
-Thank you.
-[chuckles]

13:06.708 --> 13:08.125
-How was last night?
-I couldn't sleep.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.834
I was too scared that
whoever wrote that note

13:09.834 --> 13:10.667
was gonna break in here.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.625
Sorry I couldn't stay,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.834
and I'm sorry I have to
bolt right now.

13:14.834 --> 13:17.041
-Go to this luncheon thing.
-You have to go.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.500
I know I do.
And actually, I wanna go.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.708
I have a new plan, okay?

13:23.792 --> 13:25.375
Tell me what you
think about this.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.959
[Ted] Where's Laurel?
Is she meeting us inside?

13:26.959 --> 13:28.750
She came early, she wanted
to talk to Justin.

13:30.708 --> 13:32.583
-I thought they broke up.
-I know, I know.

13:32.583 --> 13:34.792
It's complicated, honey.
She's 16.

13:34.792 --> 13:36.875
I just think he's bad news.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.291
[Kristin] I know, but maybe
this is something

13:38.291 --> 13:39.625
she has to figure out
for herself.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.625
Or maybe not.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.458
What? What are you saying?
Did something happen?

13:43.458 --> 13:44.542
Sutton, do you
know something?

13:45.417 --> 13:46.834
It's not my place.

13:46.834 --> 13:49.166
It absolutely is your place.
She's your younger sister.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.417
[sighs]

13:55.417 --> 13:58.166
Justin says you operated
on his mother

13:58.166 --> 13:59.875
and she died because
you messed up.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.583
What are you talking about?

14:02.583 --> 14:04.458
You were distracted,
you got a phone call

14:04.458 --> 14:07.208
and then you had some
intern finish up.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.750
Oh, my God,
it's really him.

14:09.750 --> 14:10.834
It's really who?

14:13.291 --> 14:14.375
L.A.

14:15.667 --> 14:16.750
Honey...

14:18.000 --> 14:19.542
This case is a lot more
complicated than you realize.

14:20.542 --> 14:21.667
I have to talk to him.

14:21.667 --> 14:22.708
-Wait, where...
-Hey...

14:23.667 --> 14:24.917
Just stay here,
I'll handle this.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.959
[Laurel] I want you to
stop texting me and
sending me flowers.

14:30.959 --> 14:32.917
My parents keep asking me
questions that I don't...

14:32.917 --> 14:34.166
Dad, what are you doing here?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.291
Sutton told me.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.834
What?

14:38.083 --> 14:39.166
I can't believe
it's really you.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.208
Laurel, can you give
us a second, please?

14:42.208 --> 14:44.166
No way! I want to hear
what you have to say.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.417
I don't have to explain.

14:47.542 --> 14:48.917
I'm sorry about
your mother, Justin.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.917
More than you know.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.542
I made a mistake

14:54.542 --> 14:56.417
and I paid for it,
and I keep paying for it.

14:56.417 --> 14:59.792
I never wanted your money!
I want answers.

14:59.792 --> 15:02.000
What happened to you that day?
Where did you go that was
so important?

15:03.208 --> 15:04.333
Why weren't you with my mom?

15:06.458 --> 15:07.875
So, it's true, Daddy?

15:07.875 --> 15:09.625
I... I don't know
what he's told you, okay?

15:11.041 --> 15:14.417
I was afraid of this when I
first thought it might be him.

15:14.417 --> 15:16.375
You knew?
You figured out who he was

15:16.375 --> 15:17.750
and you didn't say
anything to me?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.083
-I didn't know.
-Stop!

15:19.083 --> 15:20.583
-You're both keeping secrets!
-Honey...

15:20.583 --> 15:22.166
No! You're no different
than he is!

15:28.041 --> 15:29.834
Sorry I'm late. I had to check
on Emma at the cabin.

15:29.834 --> 15:31.250
It's fine.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.166
There's actually been
some family drama.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.708
And for once,
it has nothing
to do with me.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.125
Yeah, right.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.917
Anyway, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.083
No, you cannot back out
of this thing.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.000
No, no,
I want to take you.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.792
In fact, I want everyone
in there to see us together.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.959
Guess things didn't go so well
at the cabin, then, hmm?

15:50.834 --> 15:52.750
I want everyone watching

15:52.750 --> 15:54.208
because at some point
in the night

15:54.208 --> 15:55.166
I'm gonna break up with you.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.125
You said it yourself, okay?

16:00.125 --> 16:01.625
It's not safe
for Emma to stay here.

16:01.625 --> 16:02.834
And I'm not gonna let
her leave without me.

16:03.458 --> 16:04.959
How romantic.

16:04.959 --> 16:06.333
All right.

16:06.333 --> 16:10.000
We do this, publicly, loudly,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.125
so that whoever tried to
kill you will see it happen.

16:13.125 --> 16:16.792
And then he can stop
expecting us to be together.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.125
Got it.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.959
And I can leave without
putting you in danger.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.792
-Please, stop,
let's just talk about this.
-No.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.500
I'm not letting you
get behind the wheel of a car

16:25.500 --> 16:26.667
while you're in this state.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.708
Let me have the keys.
Thank you.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.166
-Laurel, I'm sorry.
-Save it!

16:31.250 --> 16:32.875
See what you did?
Thank you very much!

16:36.000 --> 16:37.291
Nothing to do with you, huh?

16:37.583 --> 16:38.667
I...

16:39.792 --> 16:42.166
May have

16:42.166 --> 16:43.625
told my mom
and dad something

16:43.625 --> 16:46.458
that Laurel wanted
to keep secret.

16:46.458 --> 16:49.500
-Of course, you did.
-It was important and scary.

16:51.083 --> 16:54.333
What, isn't that what
squeaky-clean Emma
would have done,

16:54.333 --> 16:56.041
confided in the parents?

16:56.041 --> 16:57.917
Ratting out your sister

16:57.917 --> 16:59.625
is exactly what Emma
wouldn't do.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.667
That's why Laurel
actually likes you right now.

17:04.625 --> 17:05.500
Or at least why she did.

17:05.959 --> 17:08.041
[sighs] Great.

17:08.041 --> 17:10.708
Nice to see you're undoing
all of Emma's good work

17:10.708 --> 17:11.875
on your first day back.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.542
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.500
Any news?

17:19.500 --> 17:21.208
Is Sutton any closer
to finding out...

17:21.208 --> 17:22.417
No, not yet.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.959
She's still got her hands full

17:23.959 --> 17:25.458
with her re-acclimation
as Sutton project.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.000
I bet.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.291
She did want me to come by,
though, and bring you this.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.917
All the basics,
plus some comfort food.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.708
Double stuffed
chocolate chip cookies...

17:34.708 --> 17:36.083
Those aren't from Sutton.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.125
She doesn't even know
they exist.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.875
Okay, well, she did want
me to go to the store.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.667
Fine. Comfort food
selection was on me.

17:44.667 --> 17:45.750
But if you want
something else...

17:45.750 --> 17:47.083
Are you kidding me? No.

17:48.291 --> 17:49.750
You have any milk in there?

17:49.750 --> 17:51.875
Yeah. Here you go.

17:51.875 --> 17:52.917
Thank you.

17:53.583 --> 17:54.625
So, what's with the laptop?

17:56.208 --> 17:58.500
Checking Sutton's profile page
for pictures of her and Ethan?

17:59.208 --> 18:01.125
Ha-ha. No.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.500
Apparently, I'm the only one
still trying to figure out

18:05.500 --> 18:06.500
who tried to kill my sister.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.417
What do you got?

18:12.708 --> 18:14.417
Well...

18:14.417 --> 18:16.125
I know I brought this
up to you before

18:16.125 --> 18:18.959
and you didn't like it.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.792
But...

18:21.792 --> 18:24.625
I can't help
but think about your Dad.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.542
[chuckles] This again?

18:26.542 --> 18:28.250
No.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.583
Alec paid Mads' boyfriend
to leave town

18:30.583 --> 18:32.250
when he overheard him
talking about Sutton.

18:32.250 --> 18:35.083
And I overheard
him telling Ted

18:35.083 --> 18:36.500
that Sutton
can never be allowed

18:36.500 --> 18:38.959
to find her birth mother,
and you even said

18:38.959 --> 18:41.000
that you thought he was
snooping on you in L.A.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.625
My dad is many things, okay?
But he is not a killer.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.500
I'm telling you, Emma,
it's not him.

18:46.708 --> 18:47.667
All right?

18:48.959 --> 18:49.875
Hmm?

18:50.542 --> 18:53.500
So, too much?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.291
It is absolutely too much.

18:55.291 --> 18:57.458
-And that's why
it's fabulous.
-[giggles]

18:57.458 --> 18:58.875
My Dad's gonna love it.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.625
Are you okay
with me being his date?

19:01.625 --> 19:03.750
I hope you don't think
it's weird that I called
you here but I just...

19:03.750 --> 19:04.834
[sighs]

19:05.750 --> 19:06.834
I want to make sure.

19:07.291 --> 19:08.500
That's great.

19:09.208 --> 19:11.375
Actually, it was my idea.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.708
I just didn't think he had the
guts to go through with it.

19:13.708 --> 19:16.667
Your dad does not
strike me as a fearful person.

19:16.667 --> 19:20.458
No, not generally,
but beautiful women
are his kryptonite.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.166
Oh, I'll keep that in mind.

19:23.291 --> 19:25.000
And what about you?
Who are you taking?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.083
Just Thayer, my brother.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.917
Which is old-fashioned,
I know, but...

19:29.917 --> 19:31.291
Okay, are you
kidding me?

19:31.291 --> 19:33.000
A girl like you?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.625
There should be, like,
a million guys

19:34.625 --> 19:36.166
that are killing to take you.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.375
I mean, there is this one guy.

19:38.417 --> 19:41.708
-Ryan Harwell.
-Oh, I remember him.

19:41.708 --> 19:44.959
He bought the $500 tickets
to the ballet at the benefit.

19:44.959 --> 19:47.417
Yeah, which was either
really showy and obnoxious

19:47.417 --> 19:50.041
or generous and super sweet.

19:50.041 --> 19:51.417
You could give him
the benefit of the doubt.

19:52.041 --> 19:53.625
That's what Thayer said.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.000
-Hmm.
-And Sutton.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.583
At first she was
really into it, but...

19:59.917 --> 20:02.000
See, we used to hate this guy.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.291
Then it's perfect.
It's just like a movie.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.625
You have to fight in the first
10 minutes of the movie

20:07.625 --> 20:10.166
before you can walk off
into the sunset
together at the end.

20:13.041 --> 20:14.667
Is that what's goin'
on with you and my dad?

20:14.667 --> 20:16.083
Um, maybe.

20:18.667 --> 20:21.708
All I know is that I have
spent a great deal of time

20:21.708 --> 20:23.875
getting over
difficult relationships

20:23.875 --> 20:26.542
and then I finally realized
that I have a choice.

20:26.542 --> 20:27.750
I can either

20:28.583 --> 20:29.625
choose to be miserable

20:31.083 --> 20:32.250
or choose to be happy.

20:34.708 --> 20:35.625
You really think
it's that simple?

20:36.250 --> 20:37.417
Oh, I know it is.

20:40.792 --> 20:42.542
[Kristin] I am sorry,

20:42.542 --> 20:44.667
but your father has
every reason to be upset.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.917
If Justin had targeted
our family, targeted you...

20:48.917 --> 20:50.417
Yeah, but Dad
screwed up big time.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.708
Honey, sometimes surgeons

20:54.708 --> 20:57.041
lose patients
in the operating room.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.792
But getting that call and
then leaving the surgery?

21:00.417 --> 21:01.291
I mean...

21:02.542 --> 21:03.542
Do you remember
what happened?

21:04.959 --> 21:08.875
I do, of course I do.
Your father was devastated.

21:08.875 --> 21:11.250
He had to give up
his residency
because of this case.

21:13.083 --> 21:15.375
It's the reason we left L.A.,
moved back to Phoenix.

21:16.041 --> 21:16.959
[sighs]

21:18.375 --> 21:19.959
He's a good
and decent man, Laurel.

21:21.291 --> 21:23.083
He would never
intentionally hurt anyone.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.667
[Ted] I can only imagine
how you're hurting.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.792
But the truth is, not a day
goes by that I don't think

21:31.792 --> 21:33.208
about your mother
and what happened.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.250
That makes two of us.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.041
It was a terrible time in
my life for a lot of reasons.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.125
But that surgery is one
of my deepest regrets

21:41.125 --> 21:42.625
and I haven't made
a mistake like that since.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.333
And leaving early?

21:45.333 --> 21:46.333
Where were you going?

21:47.333 --> 21:48.500
Does it really matter?

21:50.875 --> 21:53.125
Wherever I say,
nowhere was more important

21:53.125 --> 21:54.625
than where I should have been,
right by your mother's side.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.333
I'm gonna lose Laurel,
aren't I?

22:00.458 --> 22:01.500
A secret like this...

22:05.000 --> 22:05.917
Who knows what will happen?

22:15.792 --> 22:17.875
Hi. I brought you
some clothes.

22:17.875 --> 22:19.500
As a going-away present?

22:19.500 --> 22:21.083
No.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.750
I know you didn't come
with much, and...

22:23.750 --> 22:26.500
Well, I saw the Facebook
photos, and let's face it.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.917
There's some things in here
that look way better on you.

22:28.959 --> 22:30.125
What's going on?

22:30.125 --> 22:32.375
Well, I...

22:32.375 --> 22:34.041
I don't want you to go.

22:34.041 --> 22:36.333
I've been thinking about it
and I'm really sorry

22:36.333 --> 22:37.625
the way things between us
got screwed up.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.667
-Okay.
-Yes.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.917
I was upset about
the whole Ethan thing

22:41.917 --> 22:44.291
but then he told me the plan
and I had to
face reality that...

22:44.291 --> 22:45.583
[sighs deeply]

22:46.583 --> 22:48.041
I could lose my twin sister.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.875
Probably for good
and I don't want that.

22:51.834 --> 22:54.708
I don't want some guy
to tear us apart.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.333
And you realized
all this today?

22:58.333 --> 22:59.667
Mmm-hmm.

22:59.667 --> 23:01.834
Once we figure out
who attacked me,

23:01.834 --> 23:03.375
and find out
who we can really trust

23:03.375 --> 23:04.917
I wanna tell Ted and Kristin
about you.

23:05.875 --> 23:07.208
For real.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.875
And we don't even
have to tell them

23:08.875 --> 23:10.208
that it's been you
this whole time.

23:10.208 --> 23:12.291
We can say that you suddenly
showed up from Vegas

23:12.291 --> 23:14.000
and it'll be like a do-over,

23:14.000 --> 23:15.083
the way it always
should've been.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.667
I wanna believe you, Sutton...

23:18.000 --> 23:19.208
Then do.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.417
Don't go, Emma.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.375
You can have the family
that you've always wanted.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.041
Just hang on
a little bit longer.

23:42.375 --> 23:43.917
Whoa.

23:43.917 --> 23:46.583
-You look great.
-Thank you.

23:46.583 --> 23:49.041
It's a little much for
just hiding out at the cabin
but I couldn't resist.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.250
Sutton brought me this stuff.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.500
I don't know
if she's sucking me
into another lying game

23:57.500 --> 23:59.750
but she did offer me
the one thing,

24:00.458 --> 24:02.708
besides you, that I want...

24:03.750 --> 24:04.959
A family.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.208
I know. It's crazy.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.417
No. I get it.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.875
Wouldn't mind having
one of those myself.

24:11.875 --> 24:14.750
Even if there's
the slightest chance

24:14.750 --> 24:16.917
that she means
what she says,
I have to take it.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.834
So I guess this means
the breakup is off?

24:23.208 --> 24:25.583
Yeah.
I guess it is.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.667
I'm gonna go to that dance.

24:30.333 --> 24:31.333
I'm gonna show my face

24:32.458 --> 24:34.250
and then I'm gonna
come back here

24:34.250 --> 24:35.375
and I'm going to spend
the night with you.

24:37.500 --> 24:38.875
All right? I don't want
you to be scared anymore.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.667
[door opens]

24:47.792 --> 24:49.166
Should've known it was
too good to be true.

24:50.250 --> 24:51.834
Yeah, you're probably right

24:51.834 --> 24:53.000
and whatever Justin said--

24:53.000 --> 24:54.041
Not him.

24:54.625 --> 24:55.583
You.

24:57.708 --> 24:59.125
I should've known
this whole "new leaf" thing

24:59.125 --> 25:00.834
was just an act,
and now you're back

25:00.834 --> 25:01.875
to the way you always
used to be.

25:02.333 --> 25:03.542
Which was?

25:04.458 --> 25:05.959
Selfish.

25:05.959 --> 25:07.208
Vindictive. Mean.

25:08.959 --> 25:11.291
Right. That's me.

25:14.125 --> 25:15.291
I asked you not
to tell anyone.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.208
I told you that
I believed Justin or

25:19.875 --> 25:21.291
at least I was trying to.

25:21.291 --> 25:22.375
Yeah, which is crazy.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.208
I believed Ethan.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.542
I even took the fall for him

25:28.542 --> 25:30.166
when everybody thought
he stole your laptop!

25:31.959 --> 25:32.917
And you know why?

25:35.083 --> 25:36.375
Because you believed him.

25:38.708 --> 25:40.417
That's what sisters do.

25:40.417 --> 25:41.834
Now, I don't know anything
about sisters

25:41.834 --> 25:42.834
and she's the big expert.

25:43.834 --> 25:44.917
Who?

25:45.583 --> 25:47.458
I mean you.

25:50.333 --> 25:51.500
[sighs]

25:51.500 --> 25:52.750
[doorbell rings]

25:53.667 --> 25:54.792
[sighs]

25:57.041 --> 25:58.542
Look who's here.

25:58.542 --> 26:00.375
Used the front door
and everything.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.166
-You look beautiful.
-Thanks.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.542
I'm gonna go check on Laurel,
and why don't I give you two

26:14.542 --> 26:17.041
a moment to bathe
in your mutual beauty?

26:17.041 --> 26:18.250
We leave for the club in 10.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.083
You do look good.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.834
Two tuxes in one year,
who would've thought?

26:27.834 --> 26:29.125
[chuckles]

26:29.125 --> 26:30.041
I'm kind of
getting used to it.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.166
Uh, I'm not gonna do
the shiny shoes

26:33.166 --> 26:34.166
but other than that...

26:36.792 --> 26:38.291
Here.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.000
Thanks for coming
to this thing with me.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.500
My mom has been
talking about it

26:45.500 --> 26:46.583
since I was, like, eight.

26:47.458 --> 26:49.083
We used to go to the

26:49.083 --> 26:52.417
club and see all the junior
members all dressed up and

26:52.417 --> 26:54.583
a handsome guy
on every girl's arm.

26:56.583 --> 26:59.291
She'd say,
"Someday, that'll be you."

27:00.834 --> 27:02.041
Well, now it is.

27:07.166 --> 27:08.333
Thanks.

27:10.125 --> 27:11.583
My pleasure.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.333
[Male Announcer]
Miss Sutton Penelope Mercer.

27:13.959 --> 27:15.417
[all cheering]

27:15.417 --> 27:17.834
[music playing]

27:23.208 --> 27:24.959
Miss Madeline Margo Rybak.

27:25.625 --> 27:26.834
[cheering]

27:33.417 --> 27:34.875
Mr. Charles Edwards Hay.

27:35.291 --> 27:37.250
[all applauding]

27:40.250 --> 27:42.417
-Miss Catherine Elizabeth...
-No, no, no. I'm sorry.

27:42.417 --> 27:44.625
-Mrs. Mercer, I just...
-Don't Mrs. Mercer me.

27:44.625 --> 27:46.041
I know Laurel
may have forgiven you,

27:46.041 --> 27:47.834
you may have had
some come-to-Jesus moment

27:47.834 --> 27:50.041
with my husband, but
I think what you did was...

27:51.166 --> 27:54.000
-You need help.
-Mom.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.875
I'm sorry. I don't even know
what you're doing here.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.125
Please just turn around
and walk away.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.166
[music playing]

28:10.000 --> 28:12.667
What, no dips or twirls?
You okay?

28:12.667 --> 28:14.667
I'm a little twirled out, hon.

28:14.667 --> 28:15.834
It's been a rough
couple of days.

28:16.875 --> 28:18.875
Oh. I'm sorry if I...

28:18.875 --> 28:20.542
No. No, no.
I'm glad you brought it up.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.875
I just...

28:24.875 --> 28:26.250
I know sometimes
you don't think

28:26.250 --> 28:27.667
I tell you everything, but...

28:28.834 --> 28:31.375
What? Is there something
you want to tell me?

28:31.375 --> 28:32.417
You can tell me anything, Dad.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.208
No. I...

28:42.208 --> 28:43.750
Why bring something up if
it's only gonna hurt people?

28:44.583 --> 28:46.542
Right? What's the point?

28:48.625 --> 28:50.875
Uh, you mind if I cut in?

28:50.875 --> 28:51.917
Heard that's what
you're supposed to do.

28:52.667 --> 28:54.041
Thanks.

28:54.041 --> 28:55.291
-I love you, honey.
-Mmm-hmm.

28:55.875 --> 28:56.875
Have fun.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.083
Closer.

29:05.208 --> 29:07.208
-Is everything okay?
-Everything is great.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.750
Except what's a girl
got to do to get a dip

29:10.750 --> 29:11.792
or a twirl around here?

29:13.083 --> 29:14.959
[music playing]

29:17.625 --> 29:18.792
Mmm.

29:20.750 --> 29:23.458
-Just like old times.
-Yup.

29:24.750 --> 29:26.041
[indistinct talking]

29:28.750 --> 29:30.000
We should kiss.

29:31.083 --> 29:32.917
What?

29:32.917 --> 29:34.625
Everyone is watching.
It's what they're expecting.

29:35.333 --> 29:36.792
You would do it
if it were Emma.

29:42.959 --> 29:44.125
Hmm.

29:46.708 --> 29:47.959
Okay, you can do
better than that.

29:48.583 --> 29:49.792
-Sutton...
-No.

29:49.792 --> 29:50.834
We have to
give them something

29:50.834 --> 29:51.708
they can believe.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.834
[music continues]

29:58.166 --> 30:00.708
There. Now there's
no mistaking me for Emma.

30:08.542 --> 30:10.625
-Ethan, what are you doing?
-I'm leaving.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.667
-The night isn't over.
-It is for me.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.792
All right? I did my duty,
and a whole lot more.

30:14.792 --> 30:17.417
I'm sorry. I was trying
to make it seem real.

30:18.291 --> 30:20.000
-Yeah, right.
-You can't leave.

30:20.875 --> 30:23.417
It'll look weird
and people will talk.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.834
All right, well, I'm sure
you'll come up with a story

30:25.834 --> 30:27.458
that sounds good.

30:27.458 --> 30:28.583
After all,
that's what you're best at.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.750
[sighs]

30:36.208 --> 30:37.959
Any chance I could
have this dance?

30:41.834 --> 30:43.708
[music playing]

30:45.750 --> 30:47.250
Do you need some help?

30:47.250 --> 30:49.000
Isn't that what
escorts are for?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.166
Oh, no, escorts are for
grabbing plates of treats

-Mmm-hmm.

[both chuckling]

30:56.750 --> 30:59.667
Hey, um, thank you

30:59.667 --> 31:01.250
for convincing me
to take a chance on Ryan.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.375
It was definitely worth it.

31:03.375 --> 31:06.458
No, thank you for
convincing your dad to
take a chance on me. I'm...

31:07.667 --> 31:10.125
I'm hoping that he
finds it worth it, too.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.375
Maddie, I'm sorry.
You need a hand?

31:12.125 --> 31:14.625
Oh, no. Honestly, I'm fine.

31:14.625 --> 31:17.166
You two should drink
some champagne or something.

31:21.625 --> 31:24.917
-I think she likes you.
-I think she just likes having
someone to talk to.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.542
Not that she can't
talk to you. It's just,

31:26.542 --> 31:28.291
you know, woman to woman.

31:28.291 --> 31:29.708
It's different.

31:29.708 --> 31:30.834
I can imagine.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.208
-May I ask you something?
-Sure.

31:35.375 --> 31:37.291
What happened
with you and Caroline?

31:38.041 --> 31:39.917
I mean, not that I thought

31:39.917 --> 31:41.959
you guys were like
Ted and Kristin...

31:41.959 --> 31:44.375
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about the past.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.542
-Oh.
-Mmm.

31:46.542 --> 31:47.708
I thought we just weren't
gonna talk about that

[both chuckling]

32:00.083 --> 32:02.417
You're crazy, you know that?

32:02.417 --> 32:04.458
Can't let all those moves
I taught you go to waste.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.125
Okay, so how was it?

32:07.208 --> 32:10.667
Was it stuffy or snobby...

32:12.000 --> 32:13.125
Or did you
actually have fun?

32:14.959 --> 32:16.417
Sutton kissed me.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.792
It was just for a second.
I pulled away.

32:21.125 --> 32:22.625
[sighs] I just...

32:22.625 --> 32:24.667
I want us always to be
honest with each other.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.750
Okay. Why am I not surprised?

32:26.750 --> 32:28.208
I am an idiot. I'm an idiot.

32:28.208 --> 32:29.875
No. You're not an idiot.

32:29.875 --> 32:30.959
You just wanted
to believe her.

32:34.917 --> 32:36.458
We can figure it out
in the morning, okay?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.875
Tonight all I want to do

32:42.834 --> 32:44.959
is this.

it's never too late ♪

Hey.

33:09.708 --> 33:10.875
You seen Mads?

33:10.875 --> 33:13.041
For a skinny ballet girl

33:13.041 --> 33:14.750
she really does eat
a lot of chocolate.

33:14.750 --> 33:17.208
Hmm. If she wasn't my best
friend, I'd have to hate her.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.333
Thanks for being cool
about this.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.000
I know we're not
in ninth grade anymore, but...

33:24.000 --> 33:25.375
What, you thought
I'd be jealous?

33:25.834 --> 33:27.291
I don't know.

33:27.291 --> 33:29.542
I mean, we did have

33:29.542 --> 33:31.750
that night in the
McBrides' basement

33:31.750 --> 33:33.750
and I know you were pissed.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.750
I wasn't really into it,

33:35.750 --> 33:37.041
that I was carrying a torch
for Mads, but...

33:39.375 --> 33:40.875
I had no idea
that was your first time.

33:42.291 --> 33:44.917
I rejected you
after what I believe

33:44.917 --> 33:46.291
was your first time, too.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.125
And then I made sure
no one

33:48.125 --> 33:49.959
ever found out
that I'd even consider

33:49.959 --> 33:51.166
hooking up with you.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.917
By convincing
the entire school

33:52.917 --> 33:53.959
I was a total loser, right?

33:54.959 --> 33:58.000
I was what?
Lying game patient zero?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.750
Please, I don't even
remember what I did.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.291
Well, I'll never forget.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.208
You invited me
to a costume party,

34:04.208 --> 34:07.000
so, I show up in my
Harry Potter robe

34:07.000 --> 34:09.208
only to find the cops

34:09.208 --> 34:10.625
and everyone
at the party thinking

34:10.625 --> 34:11.834
I'm the one who called them.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.166
Hmm.

34:21.291 --> 34:22.750
Look, I'm sorry,

34:22.750 --> 34:23.917
but I had no right

34:23.917 --> 34:25.083
to humiliate you like that.

34:26.542 --> 34:27.583
Thanks, Sutton.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.125
That means a lot.

34:31.083 --> 34:33.000
Though I must say,

34:33.000 --> 34:34.375
it doesn't seem to have
done much damage.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.917
Look at you.
I wouldn't humiliate you now.

34:41.750 --> 34:43.834

when you get tired of Mads.

with you and Rebecca?

Are you dating now?

35:00.917 --> 35:02.166
Would that be a problem?

35:04.083 --> 35:05.875
After all, Ted,
the past is the past.

35:07.667 --> 35:09.583
Maybe Rebecca's my future.

35:09.583 --> 35:11.583
That's insane. There's no way
you could possibly...

35:11.583 --> 35:13.250
Would you relax?

35:13.250 --> 35:14.667
Think about it.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.625
Maybe I'm doing it for you.

Look, if I can keep her close,
I can keep her happy.

Make sure she doesn't
change her mind

35:23.708 --> 35:25.417
about keeping her mouth shut.

Oh, man, it's just, the past
keeps catching up with me.

Now it's dating my daughter.

You should be happy, Ted.

-Okay.

-We have a situation.

All right, so that woman,
Annie Hobbs?

talking to herself
near the Mercer home.

Unbelievable.

She's at Phoenix Presbyterian
in a private room.

that I'm not

36:47.000 --> 36:48.834
gonna give up and run away.

36:48.834 --> 36:50.875
Why not?
This whole thing was fake.

So, it should be pretty easy
to get over it.

36:52.875 --> 36:54.917
If I could let go,
I would have done that
a long time ago.

about my stupid plan

was even over with.

just so irresistible?

weird or funny or...

I love that.

I love everything about you.

37:27.625 --> 37:29.041
And I'm asking you, please...

before Alec moves her.

we have been waiting for.

anyone else did.

at the motel, but...

-Tell me what?
-The truth.

38:51.708 --> 38:52.834
You need to know the truth.

The truth about what?

39:48.291 --> 39:50.917
Honey, I know this is my old
mistake catching up with us.

39:50.917 --> 39:53.291
But it's not.
It's so much bigger than that.

39:56.208 --> 39:58.208
You never told me
you got a phone call,

39:58.208 --> 39:59.667

let some intern...

39:59.667 --> 40:01.417
-I'm sure I did.
-No, you didn't.

40:03.291 --> 40:04.834
You said
you nicked an artery.

40:04.834 --> 40:06.583
I thought that's what the
settlement was about, but...

40:08.500 --> 40:09.708
Being distracted?

40:11.125 --> 40:12.458
Rushing off someplace?

40:16.875 --> 40:18.291
Was it me?

40:18.291 --> 40:20.417
-I mean,
was I the distraction?
-Kristin...

40:20.417 --> 40:21.834
It was a rough time
for both of us,

40:21.834 --> 40:23.500
we were trying
to get pregnant.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.792
That's a lot of pressure.

40:24.792 --> 40:26.250
-Honey, don't...
-Did I phone you and...

40:26.250 --> 40:28.166
No.

40:28.166 --> 40:29.667
Trust me, Kristin,
it was not your fault.

40:34.250 --> 40:36.708
But I don't...
I don't trust you.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.750
Why would you keep
something like that
from me?

40:41.750 --> 40:43.625
The details, I mean,
even if it's nothing.

40:48.250 --> 40:50.625
How do I know
there's not something else
you're not telling me?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.166
When my baby died,

41:05.625 --> 41:06.959
I lost my mind.

41:10.333 --> 41:11.834
I heard your mother
down the hall,

41:13.291 --> 41:14.417
giving you up.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.291
Two girls. Giving you away.

41:19.750 --> 41:20.959
I wanted you.

41:22.458 --> 41:24.750
Steal you, take you,
and I did.

41:26.417 --> 41:27.667
I got Emma.

41:30.125 --> 41:31.250
But then the fire...

41:31.792 --> 41:33.000
So...

41:35.333 --> 41:38.417
If you aren't our mother,
then who is?

41:39.417 --> 41:40.583
Who was the woman
down the hall?

41:41.625 --> 41:42.750
I don't know.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.667
Wrong name. Jane Doe.

41:48.834 --> 41:50.208
And how do you know
Alec Rybak?

41:51.083 --> 41:53.208
And why does he
want to keep you here?

41:55.375 --> 41:56.542
I've said too much.

41:57.291 --> 41:58.542
You're in danger.

41:58.542 --> 42:00.000
Why? Because of Alec?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.500
It's not safe.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.708
Okay, I need to know
who tried to kill me.

42:03.708 --> 42:05.667
The man who climbed out
of the lake that night.

42:06.166 --> 42:08.083
Yes.

42:08.083 --> 42:10.041
I grabbed his arm,
but he wouldn't help.

42:10.041 --> 42:10.917
What did he look like?

42:15.208 --> 42:19.000

42:42.834 --> 42:44.750
Um, I... I had a great time,
and I'd love to do it again.

42:45.291 --> 42:46.250
I'd like that.

42:48.375 --> 42:50.083
I can't believe
this is happening between us.

42:50.667 --> 42:52.125
What?

42:52.125 --> 42:53.458
Is something happening here?

42:53.875 --> 42:55.708
[chuckles]

42:55.708 --> 42:57.125
-Good night, Alec.
-Good night.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.208
[cell phone beeps]

43:20.291 --> 43:22.083
[footsteps approaching]

43:22.083 --> 43:23.125
[gasps]

43:23.708 --> 43:24.959
Oh, Annie.

43:26.834 --> 43:28.291
What have you done now?
