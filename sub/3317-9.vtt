11:48.709 --> 11:50.043
I'm much more capable than you think.

You're referring to the fire-starter
you terminated in Baton Rouge?

killed her, then got rid of the body.

Your recklessness
puts everything we've worked for at risk.

But you can never lose yourself
to the lie.

Because someday,

14:06.263 --> 14:08.098
she will have to be put down.

What a marvelous invention.

14:16.148 --> 14:17.608
So clever.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.044
Such a sensible tradition.
Nobody bothers anymore.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.796
Now, Myrtle,
Pembie and I were just saying

14:39.880 --> 14:44.134
in addition to how thrilling it was
to get your phone call…

14:44.218 --> 14:46.220
-We… we… (CHUCKLES)
-I've… we've…

14:46.637 --> 14:50.015
just had such terrible regrets about
the whole misunderstanding.

14:50.098 --> 14:54.478
And we cannot get over your skin.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.646
PEMBROKE: Ah.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.565
No burn scars.
You look younger than ever.

14:58.649 --> 15:03.070
We… We've got to hear
all about this Misty Day

15:03.153 --> 15:05.572
and her magical mud.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.534
Should we be looking into it?

15:08.617 --> 15:09.868
Selling it, perhaps?

15:09.952 --> 15:12.287
-(LAUGHING) Oh, my God!
-(CHUCKLES)

15:12.371 --> 15:14.122
You miss the point, darling.

15:14.206 --> 15:16.917
The swamp mud is a metaphor,
her metaphor.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.420
She's a sophisticated witch
with extraordinary gifts,

15:20.504 --> 15:22.756
hiding out as a hippie swamp rat.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.510
From humble hillbilly stock,
she's been a witch since birth,

15:26.927 --> 15:30.013
her power and humanity
separating her from everyone around her.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.181
In fact,

15:31.265 --> 15:34.351
those around her
have tried endlessly to destroy her,

15:34.434 --> 15:37.354
in order to mask their own evil purposes.

15:37.437 --> 15:41.108
Yet she rose from the ashes,
stronger than ever, more fully realized.

15:41.567 --> 15:44.653
A living testament
to the greater ideals of our coven.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.322
Power, compassion, and uniqueness.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.534
We are lucky to have found her,
and she us.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.787
It resonates with my own story,
doesn't it?

15:53.871 --> 15:57.541
Myrtle, I want to toast you
for your spirit of…

15:57.624 --> 16:00.794
(STAMMERING) Give…

16:03.714 --> 16:04.840
Forgiveness, you say?

16:06.300 --> 16:10.179
Forgiveness is, and always will be,
the high road.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.639
-(GLASS SHATTERS)
-The preferred road.

16:13.432 --> 16:14.933
Would that we had such luxury.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.643
-(SPUTTERING)
-(GLASS SHATTERS)

16:17.728 --> 16:20.981
-(STRUGGLING)
-Oh, Quentin.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.734
Not to worry.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.488
It's just a bit of monkshood
in your balls.

16:28.906 --> 16:31.241
Causes temporary paralysis.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.660
Human Statue Syndrome, we call it.

16:34.453 --> 16:36.872
I believe it's the nervous system first.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.625
You lose control over your limbs,

16:39.708 --> 16:41.668
the muscles harden into cement,

16:42.002 --> 16:44.087
and it feels like ice in your veins.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.381
Then the respiratory system.

16:46.465 --> 16:47.799
Or is it the other way around?

16:47.883 --> 16:49.009
Well, no matter.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.261
It's supposed to be quite terrifying.
Is it?

16:51.345 --> 16:53.222
Are you terrified? You should be.

16:54.348 --> 16:57.142
(CHUCKLING) At any rate,
I'm not going to kill you.

16:58.268 --> 16:59.895
Well, maybe after dessert.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.564
I put a lot of effort
into the key lime pie.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.652
I do love a key lime pie,
even more than an <i>ile flottante!</i>

17:07.110 --> 17:08.779
(LAUGHING) Call me a philistine!

17:10.030 --> 17:11.281
Enough chit-chat!

17:13.742 --> 17:16.995
You've both wanted
to eliminate me for years,

17:17.079 --> 17:18.914
so you could dominate the Council.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.293
But I was never worried you'd be
hapless enough to try.

17:23.377 --> 17:26.880
Quentin!
You're a fatuous fool and a drunk!

17:27.756 --> 17:29.049
Pembie, you're even worse.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.300
You're weak-willed,

17:30.384 --> 17:34.096
boring, and your fashion faux pas
give me nightmares.

17:36.348 --> 17:40.185
I invited you here not to chastise you,
or exact revenge,

17:41.478 --> 17:43.272
but to help out the coven.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.315
To help out my beloved Cordelia.

17:45.816 --> 17:46.984
(LAUGHS)

17:47.401 --> 17:48.527
I bet you thought,

17:48.610 --> 17:51.989
"Oh, she left the melon baller in there.

17:52.281 --> 17:54.658
"She's growing old and forgetful."

17:58.704 --> 17:59.705
Ah.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.666
(MURMURING)

18:06.086 --> 18:07.838
MYRTLE: <i>I had a Turkish Angora cat</i>

18:07.921 --> 18:09.965

18:10.048 --> 18:12.176
<i>and one blue.</i>

18:12.676 --> 18:15.262
<i>She was absolutely gorgeous.</i>

18:21.393 --> 18:22.561
CORDELIA: Oh, my God.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.271
I can see.

18:39.912 --> 18:41.914
CORDELIA: I know you had
the best of intentions.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.790
But you could've asked me first.

18:43.874 --> 18:47.836
MYRTLE: Delia, does one ask a drowning man
before throwing him a life preserver?

18:48.212 --> 18:50.964
Who let this charcoal briquette back in?

18:54.885 --> 18:57.513
-Oh, sweet Jesus.
-He gets no credit.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.433
It was I who restored
our beloved Cordelia.

19:02.267 --> 19:05.145
You're not witch enough
to pull off something this delicate.

19:05.229 --> 19:08.273
Oh, but you're wrong.
I'm more witch now than I ever was.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.359
And I've got you to thank, Fiona.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.362
Being burned at the stake
was an empowering experience.

19:13.445 --> 19:14.988
There are secrets in the flames,

19:15.072 --> 19:17.407
and I came back with more than a few.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.618
You couldn't find
two that matched?

19:19.701 --> 19:20.702
(SIGHS)

19:21.870 --> 19:23.539
Why do they look so familiar?

19:24.081 --> 19:26.792
The generous donors wish
to remain anonymous.

19:36.885 --> 19:41.765
Well, if she gave you two new eyes,
it's out of guilt for having blinded you.

19:41.849 --> 19:45.060
Hurl your baseless accusations.
They have no power now.

19:45.978 --> 19:48.063
You could still end up in an ashtray,
you know.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.148
You're the one that
should be put to the stake.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.609
You murdered Madison Montgomery.

19:52.693 --> 19:55.821
Well, that's going to be
a hard one to stick, Myrtle.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.489
The girl's not dead.

19:57.573 --> 19:59.825
Not anymore, and no thanks to you.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.873
You were the one
found guilty of a capital crime.

20:06.540 --> 20:09.501
I don't care if you did survive the stake.

20:09.585 --> 20:11.044
I could have you banished.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.755
Permanent exile.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.717
-You know what that means, Myrtle?
-(LAUGHS)

20:17.217 --> 20:18.719

20:19.511 --> 20:20.804
Toxic waste.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.517
-Oh. You wouldn't dare.
-Ha!

20:25.851 --> 20:28.478
I could call
an emergency meeting

20:28.896 --> 20:31.064
-of the Council right now.
-Good.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.816
Call the Council. Good luck.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.443
I hear they're not seeing anyone
right now.

20:34.526 --> 20:36.695
Stop it! Stop it! Right now.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.490
Like it or not, Fiona is your Supreme,

20:40.574 --> 20:42.201
and you need to start
treating her like one.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.411
And you.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.539
You need to stop accusing Auntie Myrtle.

20:47.623 --> 20:50.042
We both know she's not
the one who blinded me.

20:51.502 --> 20:55.380
The real danger is outside these doors,
not inside.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.302
I'm tired. I need to lie down.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.263
When the girls get in,
make sure they stay in.

21:03.347 --> 21:04.681
It's dangerous out there.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.226
Of course, baby bird.
You go rest your new eyes.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.353
We'll see to absolutely everything.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.734
Wait. Hug me again.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.694
Of course I will, my darling girl.

Nothing.

21:55.399 --> 21:56.608
Nan, it's time to go.

21:56.692 --> 21:57.860

21:57.943 --> 21:59.736
-I need to see Luke.
-You haven't seen him yet?

You've been here since last night.

Get out before I call security!

22:21.842 --> 22:24.178
-She just wants to see him.
-Absolutely not.

22:24.803 --> 22:26.847
It's your fault my son is in a coma!

-Now.

-You're mocking my grief.
-Not your grief.

23:04.676 --> 23:07.179
-Roll with it.
-NAN: He likes that song.

23:07.262 --> 23:10.265
The one that
you sang to him before.

23:10.349 --> 23:14.269
That proves you're a fraud. I didn't sing.
I read to him from Deuteronomy.
