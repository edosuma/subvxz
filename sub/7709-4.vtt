WEBVTT

00:36.384 --> 00:37.341
Michael.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.039
D'oh! God!
Dwight, come on!

00:39.082 --> 00:40.475
I wanted to talk to you
about the downsizing--

00:40.518 --> 00:41.911
There's no downsizing.Ai'ight.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.086
But if there were,
I'd be protected

00:43.130 --> 00:44.522
as Assistant
Regional Manager?

00:44.566 --> 00:46.002
Assistant to the Regional
Manager, Dwight.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.786
Yeah, so I don't
have to worry, right?

00:47.830 --> 00:48.918
Look, look, look--

00:48.961 --> 00:50.093
I talked to corporate

00:50.137 --> 00:51.355
about protecting
the sales staff,

00:51.399 --> 00:52.835
and they said they
couldn't guarantee it

00:52.878 --> 00:54.097
if there's
downsizing, okay?

00:54.141 --> 00:56.360
But, there's no downsizing,
so just don't--

00:56.404 --> 00:58.667
Bottom line--
do I need to be worried?

00:58.710 --> 01:01.539
Mm mm mm...maybe.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.846
It looks like there's gonna
be downsizing.

01:03.889 --> 01:07.197
And it's part of my job,
but...blech.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.851
I hate it.

01:08.894 --> 01:11.767
I think the main difference
between me and Donald Trump

01:11.810 --> 01:14.987
is that, uh, I get no pleasure
out of saying the words,

01:15.031 --> 01:16.554
"you're fired."

01:16.598 --> 01:17.860
"You're fired."

01:17.903 --> 01:20.036
"Uh, you're fired."

01:20.080 --> 01:21.342
He just makes people sad,

01:21.385 --> 01:23.779
and an office
can't function that way.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.650
No way.
"You're fired."

01:25.694 --> 01:27.130
I think if I had
a catchphrase,

01:27.174 --> 01:29.045
it would be,
"You're hired.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.352
And you can work here
as long as you want."

01:31.395 --> 01:33.136
But, that's
unrealistic, so...

01:37.358 --> 01:38.707
It's a real shame.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.535
Because studies have shown
that more information

01:40.578 --> 01:42.058
gets passed through
water cooler gossip

01:42.102 --> 01:43.320
than through
official memos.

01:43.364 --> 01:47.368
Which puts me
at a disadvantage because...

01:47.411 --> 01:49.674
I bring
my own water to work.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.502
Why'd you do this?

01:51.546 --> 01:52.808
I didn't do it.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.114
What do you mean?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.377
Oh, the water cooler
was brought over here

01:56.420 --> 01:59.380
for...maintenance.

01:59.423 --> 02:01.686
So, what do you guys hear?

02:01.730 --> 02:02.731
What's the scuttlebutt?

02:05.560 --> 02:09.216
Get set for Operation
Morale Improvement--

02:09.259 --> 02:11.218
starring Michael Scott.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.481
Now, I think I've had
a little stroke of genius,

02:13.524 --> 02:15.918
in that I have had
my assistant Pam--

02:15.961 --> 02:17.354
Smile, Pam.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.661
I have had her go out
and find out whose birthday

02:19.704 --> 02:20.966
is coming up,

02:21.010 --> 02:23.186
so we can have a little
celebration for them.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.492
Not bad!
Not bad at all!

02:24.535 --> 02:25.493
All right!

02:25.536 --> 02:27.234
And the birthday
person is...

02:27.277 --> 02:29.018
drum roll please...

02:36.243 --> 02:37.200
Who is it?

02:37.244 --> 02:38.201
Whose birthday is it?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.420
Um, actually,

02:39.463 --> 02:42.118
we don't have any staff
birthdays coming up.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.424
Next person
on the...calendar.

02:43.467 --> 02:46.992
Okay, um...
that would be Meredith.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.298
Yes! All right!

02:48.342 --> 02:49.299
Come on down, Meredith!

02:49.343 --> 02:51.127
But it's not until
next month.

02:51.171 --> 02:55.392
Um...uh, okay.
Well, great.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.220
Well, you know,
it'll be a surprise.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.527
You still want
to have a party?

02:59.570 --> 03:02.182
Yeah. Why not?
Sure. Go ahead.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.314
Live a little.
C'mon, Pam.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.969
C'mon. Shake it up.
Shake it up.

03:07.012 --> 03:09.928
Shake it up!

03:09.972 --> 03:11.365
Bdddrrrooop...

03:11.408 --> 03:14.106
Uh, Spock, are there any signs
of life down there?

03:14.150 --> 03:15.717
Well, let me check,
Captain.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.290
No Captain,
no signs of life down here.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.728
Just a wet blanket
named Pam.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.688
Bddddddrrrrooooop.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.821
Star Trek...

03:32.864 --> 03:36.520
Well, for decorations,
maybe we could...

03:36.564 --> 03:37.826
it's stupid, forget it.

03:37.869 --> 03:38.957
What?

03:39.001 --> 03:40.220
Well, I was
just gonna say

03:40.263 --> 03:41.656
maybe we could
have streamers,

03:41.699 --> 03:44.267
but that's dumb,
everybody has streamers.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.355
Never mind.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.009
No, yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.880
What color
do you guys think?

03:50.317 --> 03:52.928
Well, there's green...

03:52.971 --> 03:55.017
uh, blue...

03:55.060 --> 03:57.889
yellow...red...

03:57.933 --> 03:59.543
How about green?

03:59.587 --> 04:01.502
I think green
is kind of whoreish.

04:01.545 --> 04:02.503
This was tough.

04:02.546 --> 04:05.157
I suggested
we flip a coin,

04:05.201 --> 04:08.335
but Angela said
she doesn't like to gamble.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.553
Of course, by saying that,

04:09.597 --> 04:12.948
she was gambling
that I wouldn't smack her.

04:12.991 --> 04:15.472
These are my party-planning
bee-otches.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.866
Pulled off an amazing
'80s party last year.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.041
Off the hook!

04:19.084 --> 04:20.782
So I was thinking,

04:20.825 --> 04:21.913
if you haven't already gotten

04:21.957 --> 04:23.828
a cake, um, maybe go in

04:23.872 --> 04:26.266
for one of those ice cream
cakes from Baskin Robbins.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.310
They're very good.
Very delicious.

04:27.354 --> 04:30.487
Meredith's allergic
to dairy, so...

04:30.531 --> 04:31.880
She's not the only one

04:31.923 --> 04:33.577
that's going
to be eating it, right?

04:33.621 --> 04:35.710
And I think everybody
likes ice cream cake.

04:35.753 --> 04:38.887
It's not, uh...
not just about her, so...

04:38.930 --> 04:40.062
It is herbirthday--

04:40.105 --> 04:41.324
Mint chocolate chip!

04:41.368 --> 04:42.499
would be good.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.327
How about some...
mint chocolate chip?

04:46.329 --> 04:47.722
Hey.

04:47.765 --> 04:50.812
So, listen, I was thinking
that it might be a good idea

04:50.855 --> 04:55.599
if you and I
formed an alliance.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.340
'Cause of the downsizing...

04:57.384 --> 04:59.255
I think an alliance
might be a good idea.

04:59.299 --> 05:03.477
You know,
help each other out.

05:03.520 --> 05:08.438
Do you want to form
an alliance...with me?

05:10.179 --> 05:11.398
Absolutely I do.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.921
Good, good, excellent.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.357
Okay, now we need
to figure out

05:14.401 --> 05:15.532
who's vulnerable
and who is protected...

05:15.576 --> 05:16.533
There may be--

05:16.577 --> 05:17.534
At that moment,

05:17.578 --> 05:19.101
I was just so happy.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.408
I mean, everything
Dwight does annoys me.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.887
Did you get your tickets?

05:24.019 --> 05:25.063
To what?

05:25.107 --> 05:27.501
The gun show.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.378
And I spend...hours

05:35.422 --> 05:37.424
thinking of ways
to get back at him,

05:37.467 --> 05:39.600
but only in ways
that would get me arrested.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.297
And then here he comes
and he says,

05:41.341 --> 05:44.518
"No, Jim, here's a way."

05:44.561 --> 05:46.955
And there's one other thing,
and this is important:

05:46.998 --> 05:49.914
let's keep this alliance
totally a secret.

05:49.958 --> 05:50.915
Yeah.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.048
Don't tell anyone.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.658
An alliance Oh, yeah.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.007
What does that even mean?

05:56.051 --> 05:57.574
I think it has something
to do with Survivor,

05:57.618 --> 05:58.575
but I'm not sure.

05:58.619 --> 06:01.099
Um...

06:01.143 --> 06:03.058
I know that it involves
spying on people,

06:03.101 --> 06:04.842
and we may build a fort
in accounting--

06:04.886 --> 06:05.843
Jim.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.018
Hey.
Hey. Hi, Pam.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.759
Listen, could I talk
to you for a second

06:08.803 --> 06:11.196
about the...
paper products?

06:11.240 --> 06:13.198
Did you tell Pam
about the Alliance?

06:13.242 --> 06:14.635
What? No--
Just now!

06:14.678 --> 06:16.724
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Dwight, no.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.726
I'm using her,
for the alliance.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.554
Who knows the most information about this office?

06:20.597 --> 06:21.729
Pam.

06:21.772 --> 06:22.904
Right. That's good.
Good. Pursue this.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.122
Well, I'm trying to.Mm-hmm.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.428
Do you see
what I'm doing?
Mm-hmm.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.038
But listen, I'm gonna have
to talk to her a lot.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.170
All right?

06:28.213 --> 06:30.433
And there may be chatting
and giggling.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.087
And you gotta just
pretend to ignore it.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.262
Wipe it away.
Done.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.350
All right.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.706
Can you get her?
She's right there.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.099
That is Meredith.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.101
The birthday girl.

06:46.144 --> 06:49.365
And this...
is Meredith's card.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.149
"Happy Bird-Day."

06:52.542 --> 06:55.632
Um, let's see...Jim.

06:55.676 --> 06:58.983
Jim wrote: "Meredith,
I heard you're turning 46.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.289
"But, come on,

07:00.332 --> 07:03.161
you're an accountant,
just fudge the numbers."

07:03.205 --> 07:04.685
Not bad. Pretty funny.

07:04.728 --> 07:07.905
I don't appreciate condoning
corporate fraud, though.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.516
Uh, here's the thing.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.778
Whatever I write here

07:10.821 --> 07:13.737
has to be really,
really funny.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.305
Because people out there
are expecting it.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.655
I've already set
the bar really high.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.658
And they're all worried
about their jobs, you know?

07:21.702 --> 07:23.312
It's kinda dark out there.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.923
Can you imagine if I wrote
something like, uh,

07:25.967 --> 07:29.318
"Oh, Meredith.
Um, Happy Birthday.

07:29.361 --> 07:32.277
You're great.
Love, Michael."

07:38.327 --> 07:41.635
They seem awfully chummy,
don't you think?
Yeah.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.506
What do you think
that's about?

07:43.550 --> 07:46.335
Only one way
to find out.

07:46.378 --> 07:47.858
I'm on it.

07:50.426 --> 07:51.819
You are not going
to believe this.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.168
What? I believe it.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.561
Well, tensions were
high in the kitchen.

07:54.604 --> 07:55.997
I could tell
from the body language.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.172
Hey, that looks good.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.521
What is that, turkey?

07:58.565 --> 08:00.262
Italian.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.743
Oh, Italian.
Nice. Wow.

08:02.786 --> 08:03.831
You got the works there.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.529
Red onion, provolone.
Yeah.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.009
Toby and Kevin,

08:08.052 --> 08:08.966
they're trying
to get Angela kicked off.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.011
Good. Let 'em.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.273
That's fine.
It helps our cause.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.535
Well, I don't know.

08:12.579 --> 08:13.884
Because if Kevin's
in accounting,
Yeah...

08:13.928 --> 08:15.190
and Toby's
in human resources,

08:15.233 --> 08:16.583
and they're talking?

08:16.626 --> 08:17.801
Oh...they're forming
an alliance.

08:17.845 --> 08:18.976
I love their sandwiches.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.587
I love their
sandwiches too.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.892
Yeah, their bread's
really good.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.415
Their bread
is very good.

08:23.459 --> 08:27.245
Damn it! God!
Rrrrrrr!

08:30.945 --> 08:32.686
Okay, listen.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.992
We need to assume
that everyone in the office

08:35.036 --> 08:36.254
is forming an alliance,

08:36.298 --> 08:37.952
and is therefore trying
to get us kicked off.

08:37.995 --> 08:40.694
God damn it!
Why us?

08:40.737 --> 08:42.086
Because we're strong, Dwight.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.261
Because we're strong.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.350
Meredith, Meredith.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.918
Mary...Mary had
a little lamb.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.877
Mary...Meredith
had a little lamb.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.139
Don't bring
that lamb to work,

08:51.182 --> 08:52.401
or it'll poop
on the floor--

08:53.445 --> 08:54.490
Hey! Oscar.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.491
C'mon in, what's up?

08:55.535 --> 08:56.579
Uh, I'm sorry
to bother you.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.798
Oh, not at all. Come on in.

08:57.841 --> 08:58.799
What's goin' on?

08:58.842 --> 09:00.191
My nephew is involved

09:00.235 --> 09:03.978
with, um, a charity
for cerebral palsy.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.109
And I was wondering

09:05.153 --> 09:08.199
if maybe
you'd like to...

09:08.243 --> 09:09.679
you know...

09:09.723 --> 09:11.638
What?
Uh, donate
to the charity.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.944
Oh, God.
Of course I would.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.990
Pshhh. Get it over here!

09:16.033 --> 09:16.991
Get that over here.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.253
Thank you.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.603
You know, I'm always good

09:20.647 --> 09:22.692
for some serious buckage.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.912
Wow. Two dollars?
Three dollars?

09:24.955 --> 09:25.913
People out here

09:25.956 --> 09:29.612
do not care
about...diseases.

09:29.656 --> 09:33.355
I'm going to give you $25.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.706
That's...that's...

09:36.750 --> 09:37.707
That's very generous.

09:37.751 --> 09:38.708
Oh, my gosh.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.188
Well, listen, Oscar.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.843
Generosity,
and togetherness,

09:42.886 --> 09:44.409
and community,

09:44.453 --> 09:49.327
all convalescences
into...morale.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.764
That's what I say, so...

09:54.550 --> 09:55.507
Hey, Jim.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.161
Can I talk to you
for a second?

09:57.205 --> 09:58.336
Sure. What's up?

09:58.380 --> 09:59.424
Um, I don't know.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.296
I'm just, like,
going a little crazy.

10:01.339 --> 10:04.647
'Cause I keep overhearing
all of these conversations

10:04.691 --> 10:06.301
between Michael and corporate

10:06.344 --> 10:08.520
about, like...
staff issues.

10:08.564 --> 10:09.783
Oh, no.
Yeah.

10:09.826 --> 10:12.437
He's making me take notes
on these meetings,

10:12.481 --> 10:13.569
and I'm like,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.092
"These people
are my friends,"
Right.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.312
but he's all like, "This is confidential,

10:17.355 --> 10:18.618
you can't tell anybody."

10:18.661 --> 10:21.490
But I don't know,
I just feel like I wanna--

10:21.533 --> 10:22.491
Just promise me

10:22.534 --> 10:23.579
you're not gonna say anything?

10:23.623 --> 10:24.798
I will not...

10:24.841 --> 10:25.929
I'm not gonna
tell anybody.
Okay.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.104
This is between
you and me.
Yeah.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.720
Jackpot.

10:33.763 --> 10:34.721
That was beautiful.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.592
All her idea, too.

10:36.636 --> 10:42.163
Awesome.
She's so great.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.034
Meredith. Bad breath.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.514
Meredith has bad breath.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.516
Hey. Hey.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.517
You wanted to see me?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.518
Uh, yeah.

10:49.561 --> 10:50.693
What do you know
about Meredith?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.086
I don't think
she'd be missed.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.698
There's not going to be
downsizing, Dwight, okay?

10:55.742 --> 10:59.354
I just--I need to know
a little bit more about...

10:59.397 --> 11:00.442
my friend.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.183
Name: Meredith Palmer.

11:02.226 --> 11:05.273
Uh, personal information:
divorced twice, two kids.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.535
Uh, Employer:
Dunder Mifflin Paper, Inc.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.146
Awards: multiple Dundies--

11:09.190 --> 11:10.800
I know all that.
I-I know all that.

11:10.844 --> 11:11.845
I just--I need something

11:11.888 --> 11:13.107
kind of embarrassing,
you know?

11:13.150 --> 11:14.717
Kinda fun, inside...

11:14.761 --> 11:16.676
She had a hysterectomy.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.287
Which one is that again?

11:19.330 --> 11:20.462
It's where they remove
the uterus.

11:20.505 --> 11:23.247
Oh, God, Dwight, no!

11:23.291 --> 11:25.206
I'm trying to write
something funny here, okay?

11:25.249 --> 11:27.077
What am I gonna do
with a removed uterus?

11:27.121 --> 11:28.209
It could be
kind of funny.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.864
You know what?
I am on a deadline here.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.126
And, just--okay.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.650
Thanks, thanks for your help.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.522
I'll work it out. Thank you, Dwight.

11:37.566 --> 11:40.743
That wasn't
a waste of time.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.050
Okay, here's the deal.All right.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.704
Pam says that one
of the alliances

11:44.747 --> 11:45.922
is meeting
in the warehouse

11:45.966 --> 11:47.141
during Meredith's
birthday party.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.185
Oh, my God,
we have to be there.
I know.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.621
But it's gonna be
a little tough,

11:49.665 --> 11:50.927
because there's no good place
to hide down there.

11:50.971 --> 11:51.928
No, no, yes there is.

11:51.972 --> 11:52.929
Behind the shelves--
oh, my God.

11:52.973 --> 11:53.930
What, what, what?

11:53.974 --> 11:55.192
I know. I know.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.454
I know exactly
what to do.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.455
Great.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.587
I'm a deer hunter.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.763
I go all the time
with my dad.

12:00.807 --> 12:01.895
One thing about deer,

12:01.938 --> 12:04.288
they have very
good vision.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.595
One thing about me,

12:06.638 --> 12:12.340
I'm better at hiding
than they are...at vision.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.907
This is gonna
be perfect, okay?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.343
Centrally located.
Perfect cover.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.692
I can hear
and see everything.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.172
Good.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.173
Michael.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.174
Just a sec.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.436
Are you done yet? Almost there.

12:21.479 --> 12:22.437
Just a...second.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.655
It is perfect.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.570
Thank you. Excellent.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.572
Here we go. It is time.
Thank you.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.009
Okay! C'mon, let's go!

12:29.052 --> 12:31.925
Get the cake! Here we go.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

12:31.968 --> 12:33.230
Shh! Be quiet!

12:33.274 --> 12:35.058
Wait, this isn't gonna work.
The lid's open.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.930
So, tape it down.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.061
I can't do that.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.541
Then you won't be able
to breathe.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.108
Look, I can breathe
just fine, okay,

12:41.151 --> 12:42.631
but if it makes you
feel better,

12:42.674 --> 12:44.111
I'll poke holes
in the box.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.939
Thank you.
Thank you. Okay.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.466
Surprise!

12:51.509 --> 12:53.120
Oh! Surprise!

12:53.163 --> 12:54.121
No, it's a--

12:54.164 --> 12:56.036
It's surprise, Meredith!

13:07.525 --> 13:08.526
No!

13:08.570 --> 13:10.441
You need to go upstairs

13:10.485 --> 13:12.095
so people don't notice
that we're both gone.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.575
Right. That's good.

C'mon. A little bit.
A little bit.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.748
No, no, I can't eat dairy.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.533
Oh, right. Oh, God.
Too bad, it's so good.

13:58.576 --> 13:59.577
Yeah, it makes me sick.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.318
You know what?

14:01.362 --> 14:03.320
If I were
allergic to dairy,

14:03.364 --> 14:04.495
I think I'd kill myself.

14:04.539 --> 14:07.847
'Cause this is way,
way too good.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.242
He's in a box?

14:12.286 --> 14:14.244
Pam, he's in a box.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.594
He's downstairs
in a box

14:16.638 --> 14:17.987
on the floor
near the shelves.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.555
I'm serious.
Go down there.

14:20.598 --> 14:21.599
And work your magic...

14:25.908 --> 14:26.996
Hey, where are you?

14:27.040 --> 14:30.739
Yeah, we were supposed
to meet here.

14:30.782 --> 14:31.783
What?

14:33.481 --> 14:35.831
Oh, my gosh!

14:35.875 --> 14:37.180
That ties in perfectly

14:37.224 --> 14:40.444
with something that Michael was telling me earlier.

14:40.488 --> 14:43.578
I just don't know
what some of the people in,

14:43.621 --> 14:46.146
like, accounting,
are gonna do.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.756
It said specifically that...

14:47.799 --> 14:49.410
Oof...

14:49.453 --> 14:50.411
Oh...

14:50.454 --> 14:52.369
Hey, Jim.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.718
Good party, huh?

14:53.762 --> 14:55.459
Just a little something
I...whipped up, you know,

14:55.503 --> 14:56.547
a little morale boost.Yeah?

14:56.591 --> 14:57.679
No big deal.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.593
Speaking of which,
I meant to tell you.

14:58.636 --> 14:59.942
Very impressive.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.640
The, uh, donation you gave
to Oscar's charity.

15:02.684 --> 15:03.990
Oh.
What was that, 25 bucks?

15:04.033 --> 15:07.907
Yeah, well, you know,
money isn't everything, Jim.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.604
It's not the key
to happiness.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.519
You know what is?

15:11.562 --> 15:12.737
Joy.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.261
You should remember that.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.959
Maybe you'd give
more than $3.00 next time.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.005
Yeah, well, $3.00 a mile

15:19.048 --> 15:21.094
is going to end up
being, like, 50 bucks.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.095
So...

15:22.138 --> 15:23.792
God, I can't even calculate

15:23.835 --> 15:26.316
what you're gonna
have to give.

15:32.844 --> 15:33.802
Is Oscar around?

15:33.845 --> 15:35.804
I just thought
it was a,

15:35.847 --> 15:38.981
kind of a flat,
you know, $25

15:39.025 --> 15:40.635
one-time donation.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.463
I didn't think it was
a per-mile kinda deal,

15:42.506 --> 15:43.986
you know, so...

15:44.030 --> 15:46.641
Well...that's what
a walk-a-thon is.
I know--

15:46.684 --> 15:48.121
It says it right
on the sheet.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.296
Look, look at the sheet.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.515
It says it's however
many dollars per mile.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.996
Right. Got it.
Yes. So, it does.

15:54.040 --> 15:54.997
Um...

15:55.041 --> 15:56.477
I just think
it's kind of cheap

15:56.520 --> 15:57.782
to "undonate" money
to a charity.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.393
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.656
I-I wasn't--that wasn't
what I was...no.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.701
I-I-It's not about
the money.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.921
It's just...

16:05.965 --> 16:11.057
it's the ethics
of the thing, Oscar.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.536
How's your nephew?

16:12.580 --> 16:14.103
Is he in good shape?
Yeah.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.800
How many miles
did he do last year?

16:15.844 --> 16:17.019
Last year,
he walked 18 miles.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.673
Son of a bitch.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.196
That is impressive!
Good for him.

16:42.653 --> 16:43.828
Happy birthday,
Meredith.

16:43.872 --> 16:44.916
Read it out loud.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.092
And say who
wrote everything,

16:46.135 --> 16:48.137
so we know
whose is the best.

16:48.181 --> 16:51.140
"Happy Bird-Day."

16:53.403 --> 16:55.927
"Meredith, good news:

16:55.971 --> 16:57.755
you're not actually
a year older,

16:57.799 --> 17:00.932
because you work here,
where time stands still."

17:02.108 --> 17:03.761
I don't know about that--

17:03.805 --> 17:04.762
That was Stanley.

17:04.806 --> 17:08.462
"Meredith,
Happy Birthday.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.899
You're the best,
Love, Pam."

17:10.942 --> 17:11.943
Aw.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.424
Blech!

17:14.468 --> 17:15.773
Thanks, downer.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.036
This is from Michael.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.604
"Meredith: Let's hope
the only downsizing

17:20.648 --> 17:21.866
that happens to you

17:21.910 --> 17:27.481
is that someone
downsizes your age."

17:27.524 --> 17:29.091
Because of the downsizing.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.658
Rumors.

17:30.701 --> 17:34.705
And because
you're gettin' old.

17:34.749 --> 17:37.012
No, I get it--
it's funny.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.144
You didn't get the joke.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.275
So...that's cool.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.363
That's

17:40.407 --> 17:44.193
Actually, I have
a bunch of these...

17:44.237 --> 17:45.455
good ones
that I didn't use.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.502
Um...oh, where's that, uh--

17:48.545 --> 17:50.112
oh, okay,
here's a good one.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.158
Um, "Hey, Meredith,
Liz Taylor called.

17:52.201 --> 17:55.117
She wants her age back
and her divorces back."

17:55.161 --> 17:56.118
'Cause Meredith's
been divorced,

17:56.162 --> 17:57.337
like, twice?
Is that right?

17:57.380 --> 17:58.642
Uh, you're right.

17:58.686 --> 17:59.817
Did I get that right?

17:59.861 --> 18:01.819
Okay.
Right. Yes.

18:01.863 --> 18:04.126
Divorce...

18:04.170 --> 18:06.433
um...oh, okay.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.783
"Meredith is so old."

18:08.826 --> 18:09.827
How old is she?

18:09.871 --> 18:12.091
Well, if everybody...
could do it.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.570
"Meredith is so old..."

18:13.614 --> 18:14.876
How old is she?

18:14.919 --> 18:15.920
"She's so old,

18:15.964 --> 18:17.400
"she went into
an antique store

18:17.444 --> 18:19.010
and they kept her."

18:23.189 --> 18:24.364
Well, that wasn't even mine.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.975
I got that off
the internet...website...

18:27.018 --> 18:28.019
so, don't
get mad at me...

18:28.063 --> 18:29.108
Uh...

18:29.151 --> 18:31.110
Nice party, Michael.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.982
This isn't my fault.

18:34.025 --> 18:34.983
Um, ladies,

18:35.026 --> 18:36.724
not your best effort.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.029
The streamers?

18:38.073 --> 18:39.205
I think we could have
done better than that,

18:39.248 --> 18:40.249
don't you think?

18:40.293 --> 18:42.991
Phyllis wanted red.
I didn't.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.035
Oh, boy, you...

18:44.079 --> 18:46.168
Okay, wait--
all right, people,

18:46.212 --> 18:48.953
hold on, hold on,
hold on just a second, okay?

18:48.997 --> 18:49.998
I think we're losing sight

18:50.041 --> 18:52.087
of what is really
important here.

18:52.131 --> 18:57.179
And, that is
that we are a group of people

18:57.223 --> 18:58.659
who work together.

18:58.702 --> 19:02.010
I was--I really wasn't
gonna flaunt this.

19:02.053 --> 19:05.187
I have made
a very sizeable donation

19:05.231 --> 19:08.843
to Oscar's nephew's...

19:08.886 --> 19:11.933
Walk-A-Thon.

19:11.976 --> 19:12.934
$25.

19:12.977 --> 19:13.935
Per mile.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.110
Per mile, yes.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.548
When I retire,
I-I-I don't want to just

19:18.592 --> 19:21.334
disappear
to an island somewhere.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.466
I want to be the guy
who gives everything back.

19:23.510 --> 19:26.121
A check for the kids.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.166
And for the team.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.645
I want it to be like,

19:28.689 --> 19:32.519
"Hey, who donated
that hospital wing...

19:32.562 --> 19:34.521
that is saving
so many lives?"

19:34.564 --> 19:37.088
"Uh, well, I don't-
I don't know.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.003
It was anonymous."

19:39.047 --> 19:43.530
"Well, guess what?
That was Michael Scott."

19:43.573 --> 19:45.793
"But, ah...
it was anonymous,

19:45.836 --> 19:49.231
how do you know?"

19:49.275 --> 19:51.755
"Because I'm him."

19:51.799 --> 19:56.238
Thank you, Michael.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.805
Come here.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.242
Don't cash that
until Friday, okay?

20:00.286 --> 20:02.288
Really
Yeah.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.899
Oh. Happy Birthday.
Thanks.

20:04.942 --> 20:05.900
I could say something--

20:05.943 --> 20:08.119
Don't do that.
Okay.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.166
Okay, okay--
I have something

20:11.210 --> 20:13.516
that totally
tops the box!

20:13.560 --> 20:14.952
Oh, tell me!
Tell me!
Okay.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.389
I have just
convinced Dwight

20:16.432 --> 20:18.869
that he needs
to go to Stamford,

20:18.913 --> 20:20.131
and spy on
our other branch.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.350
No, no, no.

20:21.394 --> 20:22.873
But before he does so,

20:22.917 --> 20:24.745
I told him that he should
dye his hair

20:24.788 --> 20:25.833
to go undercover.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.576
If we can get him
to drive to Connecticut

20:29.619 --> 20:30.794
and put peroxide
in his hair--

20:30.838 --> 20:31.752
What the hell is this?

20:31.795 --> 20:32.883
What, are you trying

20:32.927 --> 20:34.015
to cop a feel
or somethin', Halpert?

20:34.058 --> 20:35.146
No, dude, no--
Dude, no, I was just--

20:35.190 --> 20:37.192
listen--whoa--

20:37.236 --> 20:38.324
God, I don't even--

20:38.367 --> 20:39.977
I don't even know
how to explain this.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.240
Um, uh...

20:41.283 --> 20:43.242
Dwight asked me to be in an alliance.

20:44.286 --> 20:47.420
And, then, um,
um, we were--

20:47.463 --> 20:49.030
we've just been
messing with him,

20:49.073 --> 20:51.075
uh, because of the whole
alliance thing.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.076
Um...

20:52.120 --> 20:53.295
It's just office pranks.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.514
It's stupid.
It's just office pranks.

20:54.557 --> 20:55.602
An alliance?

20:55.645 --> 20:57.647
What the hell's
he talking about?

20:58.866 --> 21:00.911
I have absolutely no idea.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.352
C'mon.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.792
Do I feel bad
about betraying Jim?

21:11.835 --> 21:14.316
Not. At. All.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.883
That's the game.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.363
Convince him we're
in an alliance,

21:17.406 --> 21:19.626
get some information,
throw him to the wolves.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.497
That's politics, baby.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.499
Get what you can
out of someone,

21:23.543 --> 21:24.979
then crush them.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.241
I think Jim
might have learned

21:26.285 --> 21:28.330
a very valuable lesson.
