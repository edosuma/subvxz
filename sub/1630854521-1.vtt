-[woman] What do we want?

00:29.363 --> 00:32.783
You'd think they'd want to be home
for Christmas Eve.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.411
I think that's exactly
what they want, sir.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.915
They all have someone they love
missing from their family.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.709
-[woman] When do we want it?
-[crowd chanting] Now!

00:41.792 --> 00:43.377

00:43.461 --> 00:44.920

00:45.004 --> 00:47.673

-Justice!

00:47.757 --> 00:48.758
[police officer] Move!

00:48.841 --> 00:51.218
[all clamoring]

00:52.845 --> 00:55.765
[reporter on TV] These women say
their loved ones go missing twice.

00:55.848 --> 00:58.976
Once in the real world
and once in police files.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.855
Today, they've come to La Sûreté du Québec
to demand they be heard.

01:02.938 --> 01:06.442
5,000 Indigenous women and girls
have been lost to this genocide.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.278
Ten women from the Iotenen'tón:ni
Mohawk community

01:09.361 --> 01:11.655
have been reported missing
in the past year

01:11.739 --> 01:13.240
and the SQ do nothing!

01:14.617 --> 01:16.285
[police officer] I don't know, miss.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.162
[woman] Why aren't you looking
for my daughter?

01:19.497 --> 01:21.373
[shouting indistinctly]

01:23.083 --> 01:26.128
-Where is Blue?
-Get the fuck out of my face!

01:26.378 --> 01:28.547
[woman screaming]

01:28.756 --> 01:30.925
I don't give a shit about your rights!

01:33.677 --> 01:35.179
Armand! Armand!

01:38.098 --> 01:40.267
I am within my rights to protest!

01:40.351 --> 01:41.560
[police officer] Hey! Back up!

01:42.102 --> 01:44.522
Back the fuck up!

01:44.605 --> 01:48.651
-Stop moving. You're just making it worse.
-Get off her! Get off her!

01:48.943 --> 01:50.277
Give me the key.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.781
-Where's your goddamn respect?
-Sorry, sir.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.247
I'm so sorry.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.707
Armand!

02:21.976 --> 02:23.269
Is Blue your sister?

02:25.396 --> 02:26.438
Yeah.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.068
How long has she been gone?

02:32.278 --> 02:33.362
Over a year now.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.449
Did she go missing from your community,
from Iotenen'tón:ni?

02:37.533 --> 02:38.492
No.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.078
She got a ride and never came home.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.246
[Gamache] Hmm.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.791
-Who's dealing with your case?
-No one's dealing with our case.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.126
And no one ever will.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.004
Blue's been missing 13 months and 11 days.

02:50.546 --> 02:55.050
Peacekeepers thought she ran away,
so they asked SQ for help nine months ago.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.011
We're still waiting.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.180
How old is Blue?

03:01.307 --> 03:03.934
-Eighteen.
-You don't think she's run away?

03:04.727 --> 03:06.186
Blue would never leave Pearl.

03:06.979 --> 03:10.149
Pearl is Blue's daughter.
She loved her more than anything.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.541
This is us, just on the left here.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.676
-[Pearl crying]
-Come on. Let's get you inside.

03:39.345 --> 03:41.472
Now, who wants cartoons and cookies?

03:47.353 --> 03:50.773
We called her our little blue jay
because when she was little,

03:50.856 --> 03:54.735
she loved to play tricks on us,
just hiding any place she could fit.

03:55.611 --> 03:58.489
But this isn't a trick.
She's out there somewhere

03:58.572 --> 04:00.491
and she's scared and alone.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.706
Will you help us find her?

04:09.625 --> 04:10.626
Yes.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.215
[car door closes]

04:35.484 --> 04:36.944
[people chattering]

04:37.778 --> 04:39.780
[Reine-Marie] There he is, at last.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.324
[people chattering]

04:45.327 --> 04:47.621
[speaking French] Merry Christmas.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.790
Reine, I'm so sorry.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.459
-You missed the champagne.
-Jean-Guy must be here.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.086
-[Beauvoir] Finally.
-[chuckles]

04:55.462 --> 04:58.340
-What, no Enid?
-No, no, she's sick.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.592
I left her with some chicken noodle soup.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.428
Yeah, I told her
I'd be as late as possible.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.595
[laughs]

05:03.679 --> 05:06.515
-Isabelle, Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Patron.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.100
I'm sorry I have to leave so early.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.769
I have two little girls at home
who are very excited.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.981
I understand.
Good luck trying to get them to sleep.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.441
Thank you for the gifts.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.317
-You're welcome.
-Okay, take care.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.236
-Good night.
-I'll show you out.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.072
Oh. Hello.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.867
Armand, mon ami!

05:27.161 --> 05:30.622
Brought you your favourite.
All the way from Scotland.

05:30.748 --> 05:33.417
-[Gamache gasps]
-And not a hint of peat.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.169
Oh!

05:35.252 --> 05:37.379
Pierre! My Christmas is perfect.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.382
So, what the hell happened today?

05:40.466 --> 05:44.261
-When you drove that family home.
-I didn't know what else to do.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.639
[chuckles]
Francoeur is gonna be gunning for you.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.855
You know how many of these cases
end up on my desk as homicides?

05:56.732 --> 06:00.569
You're running an operation
out of Iotenen'tón:ni, aren't you?

06:01.070 --> 06:03.405
You know that family? The Two-Rivers?

06:04.490 --> 06:05.324
Not really.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.994
I mean, we're investigating
this guy Kevin Kis.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.456
And Blue Two-Rivers
is dating his brother Tommy.

06:13.332 --> 06:17.086
We looked into her disappearance
to see if there was any connection.

06:17.461 --> 06:21.465
Her and Kevin took off
when Blue and Tommy disappeared, so...

06:21.548 --> 06:23.008
Did you find anything?

06:24.051 --> 06:27.012
Peacekeepers are pretty sure
those kids just ran off.

06:27.096 --> 06:30.557
Now, we didn't find anything
to suggest that they were wrong.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.686
I mean, all the leads we followed,

06:34.770 --> 06:37.147
they all said that Blue
and Tommy were last seen

06:37.231 --> 06:39.483
getting a ride
with Kevin Kis in his truck.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.777
-Did you trace him?
-Tried.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.405
Truck was last seen crossing the border.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.532
Mmm.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.830
Would you run those plates for me?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.081
Sure.

06:55.666 --> 06:59.586
But I am telling you,
these cases are gonna break your heart.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.964
Most of these families do not get answers

07:02.047 --> 07:05.008
and I know
you are gonna obsess about this.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.011
[Gamache sighs]

07:10.055 --> 07:13.058
[somber music playing]

07:24.611 --> 07:27.573
Come on, Crie. It's your big night.
We can't be late.

07:27.656 --> 07:28.949
She promised.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.703
You know, I bet she's gonna meet us there.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.709
[in French] Little works of art.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.461
It's a Li Bien ball.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.967
This is the last one.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.719
Your mother made these?

07:51.430 --> 07:52.973
Made them.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.975
Destroyed them.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.228
She tore every ornament
from the tree, the year I turned ten.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.855
Glass got everywhere.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.232
She laughed.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.484
They took her away.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.115
[bells tolling]

08:13.076 --> 08:16.288
[Crie in English] She always says she will
and then she doesn't show.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.248
[Richard] She'll be there. Come on now.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.959
Your mother wouldn't miss this
for the world.

08:21.043 --> 08:24.213
Crie. We're so excited
about your singing tonight.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.882
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Richard.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.800
[in French] Oh no! Not like this!

08:29.259 --> 08:30.427
Not like this!

08:30.594 --> 08:31.720
I love you like this.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.055
Not like this!

08:33.138 --> 08:34.264
[camera shutter clicking]

08:36.767 --> 08:37.643
I love you.

08:42.439 --> 08:43.357
Shit.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.486
Come on, one more picture?
Isn't that why I'm here?

08:47.819 --> 08:49.404
[camera shutter clicking]

08:51.365 --> 08:52.783
I want to be with you, CC...

08:52.866 --> 08:55.786
I'd rather be here than listening to
a bunch of kids

08:55.869 --> 08:57.871
whining at my daughter's singing!

08:57.955 --> 08:59.373
I mean forever.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.667
You're crazy!

09:07.506 --> 09:11.093
[singing in English]
They sold me a dream of Christmas

09:11.593 --> 09:14.763
They sold me a silent night

09:16.390 --> 09:17.307
Just him.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.980
'Till I believed in the Israelite

09:23.647 --> 09:27.150
And I believed in Father Christmas

09:27.234 --> 09:31.154
And I looked to the sky with excited eyes

09:31.238 --> 09:35.158
'Till I woke with a yawn
At the first light of dawn

09:35.242 --> 09:38.161
And I saw him and through his disguise

09:39.955 --> 09:43.917
I wish you a hopeful Christmas

09:44.001 --> 09:46.628
I wish you a brave new year

09:46.712 --> 09:48.213
Decided to show up, huh?

09:48.714 --> 09:51.341
Well, of course, I'd show up.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.721
I'm here to see.
I don't care about...

09:55.971 --> 10:00.058
They said there'll be snow at Christmas

10:00.142 --> 10:03.312
They said there'll be peace on Earth

10:03.395 --> 10:07.482
Hallelujah, Noel be it heaven or hell

10:07.566 --> 10:13.238
The Christmas we get we deserve

10:14.281 --> 10:16.283
[all cheering]

10:25.500 --> 10:26.752
[Crie] Where were you, Mama?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.628
[CC] I was there, wasn't I?

10:37.471 --> 10:41.975
You know, I think there's one last

10:42.392 --> 10:45.645
chocolate snowflake left on that tree.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.814
[chuckles]

10:49.608 --> 10:51.151
[gasps]

10:53.028 --> 10:54.363
I'm so sorry, Mama.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.031
[in French] It was a mistake, CC.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.408
No.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.535
The only mistake around here...

11:01.078 --> 11:02.412
was marrying you

11:03.497 --> 11:05.791
and giving birth to that!

11:11.129 --> 11:12.672
[Crie groans]

11:29.398 --> 11:31.858
[Christmas music playing over speakers]

11:35.987 --> 11:37.989
[camera shutter clicking]

11:39.741 --> 11:41.451
[in English] Here's your coffee, Ruth.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.580
You think it's cashmere or kitten?

11:45.914 --> 11:47.374
My money's on kitten.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.544
She probably caught it
and skinned it herself.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.296
-[all laughing]
-Who the fuck does she thinks she is?

11:53.380 --> 11:56.842
Haven't you heard?
She's the new you. She's written a book.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.928
Written more than she's read.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.639
Underneath that armour,
I'm sure she's a fine girl.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.266
CC's not all bad.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.686
Showing Clara's latest art
to the great Saul Petrov, no less.

12:07.769 --> 12:11.731
Kind of hoping he recommends me
to one of those fancy galleries

12:11.815 --> 12:14.776
-that show his work.
-Is she taking a commission?

12:15.694 --> 12:18.405
-Sorry. I forgot the sugar.
-Yeah, sure.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.952
God knows she could use some.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.292
[woman singing]

12:30.375 --> 12:36.214
Welcome, Madame and Monsieur,
to Three Pines' Boxing Day Curling Match!

12:36.339 --> 12:38.216
[all cheering]

12:38.341 --> 12:43.221
Give it up for the fiercest of females,
The Three Graces!

12:43.305 --> 12:44.181
[whooping]

12:44.264 --> 12:47.851
This fearsome foursome go head-to-head

12:47.934 --> 12:49.811
with the undefeated...

12:49.895 --> 12:51.021
Ta-da-da!

12:51.313 --> 12:53.607
Curl Power!

12:53.773 --> 12:55.066
[women booing]

12:55.150 --> 12:58.403
[woman] Three Pines!
Let's take the time to welcome them back.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.447
Welcome to town, ladies.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.240
You look great.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.868
We're getting started
in just a few moments.

13:04.951 --> 13:09.247
So now is the time to grab
something hot from those bistro boys.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.249
I know what I want to grab...

13:11.333 --> 13:12.334
[arguing in French]

13:13.251 --> 13:16.463
[in English] Almond milk,
one shot latte with half a sugar

13:16.546 --> 13:18.548
and half a sweetener, my love.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.052
It's okay. It's okay.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.347
You must be Richard. Saul Petrov.

13:25.430 --> 13:29.935
We met once before, actually,
at your exhibition in Toronto.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.561
Of course.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.147
[CC] We need to get on.
It's about to start.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.149
Come on, let's find our seats.

13:38.693 --> 13:39.778
Allez.

13:42.072 --> 13:46.868
CC, did you have a chance
to show Saul Petrov my portfolio yet?

13:47.536 --> 13:50.497
I mean, just to know,
he thought my work showed promise.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.874
No, he doesn't. I'm sorry.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.712
[woman] Still got it going on.

13:59.089 --> 14:02.175
The players are on the ice
and we're ready to begin.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.302
So please, take your seats.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.887
Take your seats!

14:07.764 --> 14:12.435
Hey, hey, keep the energy up.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.021
Let's give it up for Bea!

14:16.398 --> 14:22.153
The Graces are chasing every stone!

14:22.779 --> 14:26.116
Are they going to take it?

14:26.199 --> 14:30.662
-Curl Power makes the perfect sweep.
-Okay. Let's go, ladies.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.000
[women shouting]

14:36.293 --> 14:37.335
[cheering]

14:37.669 --> 14:39.379
[whooping]

14:39.921 --> 14:43.550
[woman] What a great hit and roll
by The Three Graces.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.012
Oh, come on!

14:47.721 --> 14:51.516
Y'all wanna sweep my porch, gals?
Come on, ladies.

14:52.142 --> 14:56.479
Oh! That's come up shorter than expected.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.734
Pressure's on.
Turn it over to Three Graces...

15:00.817 --> 15:02.402
[all cheering]

15:03.028 --> 15:07.324
These mighty matriarchs
could be gold medallists!

15:07.407 --> 15:09.159
A great double take out!

15:12.412 --> 15:15.999
The pressure's on for Curl Power now!

15:16.082 --> 15:17.792
There we go!

15:18.627 --> 15:21.004
Great takeout!

15:21.588 --> 15:26.259
Now we're at a draw. Three points each.
We've got ourselves a match Three Pines.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.846
Here it comes!

15:29.929 --> 15:31.473
[electricity buzzing]

15:33.391 --> 15:34.976
Come on, ladies!

15:35.560 --> 15:37.562
Oh, she's done it!

15:37.646 --> 15:38.730
[all cheering]

15:38.813 --> 15:40.482
-Come on, Three Graces!
-[air hissing]

15:40.565 --> 15:41.524
[electrical buzzing]

15:42.025 --> 15:44.402
Yes!

15:44.486 --> 15:48.281
Game over for Curl Power!

15:49.366 --> 15:51.701
What a way to go,

15:51.785 --> 15:55.205
defeated by a bunch of seniors.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.998
[blows whistle]

16:29.864 --> 16:31.658
[cell phone buzzing]

16:36.121 --> 16:38.707
-Sir.
-[man] I'm cutting your holiday short.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.126
I'm sending you out of town.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.462
He's punishing me
for driving that family home.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.590
Your kindness is your greatest strength.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.343
I'm not sure Francoeur
would agree with you.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.432
-Now you stay warm up there, mon amour.
-I will.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.351
-Je T'Aime.
-Je T'Aime.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.270
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.611
[door closes]

17:10.113 --> 17:11.197
[sighs]

17:11.281 --> 17:14.284
[somber music playing]

18:30.485 --> 18:34.280
-Welcome to the back of beyond.
-Merry Christmas to you, Jean-Guy.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.742
I was supposed to be
at a drinks thing tonight.

18:37.826 --> 18:41.162
I was about to have
the best turkey sandwich ever made.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.248
I was gonna watch a movie with my girls.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.084
Tell them I'll spring
for movie tickets and popcorn

18:46.167 --> 18:48.169
-in the New Year.
-They'll hold you to it.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.754
Mathide never forgets a thing.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.339
Hey, nice shoes.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.675
What? I left in a hurry.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.010
Spare boots and a coat in the trunk.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.262
Thank you.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.484
Chief Inspector Gamache. Yvette Nichol.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.239
Inspector Beauvoir. We've met before.

19:16.781 --> 19:17.866
I remember.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.995
-Hello.
-Sergeant Lacoste.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.788
Oh, wow, Sergeant.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.707
Living the dream.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.753
-You were the first on the scene?
-I grew up in the next town over.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.632
I was visiting my folks
when Cowansville Police called it in.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.385
You must be in a hurry to get back.
We won't keep you long.

19:37.468 --> 19:41.723
No, General Director Francoeur said
I should stay as long as you need me.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.978
It must be fate. Just the other day,
he suggested I finish training with you.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.439
Said I should learn from the best. You.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.232
-The best.
-Agent Nichol,

19:51.316 --> 19:53.693
why don't you walk us through
what you have so far.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.195
Okay, yep. Follow me.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.324
Victim was CC de Poitiers.

19:59.407 --> 20:02.410
She was watching a curling match
when she collapsed

20:02.493 --> 20:04.704
in front of the whole village pretty much.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.539
Not that anyone saw a thing.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.835
-You spoke to our witnesses?
-Just to get names and addresses.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.463
But people around here sure like to talk.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.674
-And no one saw anything suspicious?
-Not a thing.

20:16.758 --> 20:20.136
One minute, she's sitting in the chair.
Next, she's dead.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.765
Electrocuted right here
in the middle of a curling match.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.937
A local woman tried to revive her.
Ruth, uh... something.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.147
Santo, Zanto...

20:32.148 --> 20:34.150
Uh, now it's gone.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.238
-I should have written it down.
-That would have been helpful.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.325
It looks like it was a freak accident.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.911
Sorry to bring you out here for nothing.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.287
You sure it's nothing?

20:47.455 --> 20:51.709
Uh, well, she was electrocuted, so...

20:51.793 --> 20:54.837
Every mistake I made
was because I made an assumption,

20:54.921 --> 20:57.465
and then I acted upon it
as if it were fact.

20:57.548 --> 20:58.716
Very dangerous.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.220
We should have tattooed on the back

21:02.303 --> 21:05.098
of whichever hand we use
to write or shoot,

21:05.181 --> 21:06.432
"I might be wrong."

21:06.516 --> 21:08.059
[chuckles]

21:12.939 --> 21:14.440
Okay, you're not kidding.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.568
Uh, the...

21:18.319 --> 21:21.072
The victim wrote a book.

21:21.656 --> 21:25.868
How does somebody get electrocuted
out here in the open?

21:26.285 --> 21:30.039
[Nichol] Could the snow work like water,
like a toaster oven and a bathtub?

21:30.123 --> 21:31.958
Did you find a toaster oven?

21:32.041 --> 21:34.669
[Lacoste] Appliances these days
have automatic shutoffs.

21:34.752 --> 21:38.214
So you throw a toaster oven in a bath,
all you do is break it.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.967
It's nearly impossible
to electrocute a person.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.344
To do it in front of witnesses...

21:43.428 --> 21:45.304
You'd have to be bat-shit to try.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.640
[Gamache]
You'd have to be brilliant to succeed.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.644
Thanks.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.521
[speaks French] Sorry.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.109
[Lacoste in English]
Hey. I'm going to need...

22:03.573 --> 22:08.036
-You've met Agent Nichol before?
-Yeah. She came in for a week of training.

22:08.119 --> 22:13.541
She poured coffee down my favourite shirt,
she shredded an irreplaceable document

22:13.624 --> 22:17.128
and disclosed a safe house address
to a violent perpetrator.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.005
She could do with training.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.841
You must have left Francoeur
off your Christmas list

22:21.924 --> 22:24.761
for him to send us here
and give us that shit-show.

22:25.553 --> 22:29.098
I know you have an addiction
for rescuing lame ducks

22:29.182 --> 22:32.060
and turning them into your project, but...

22:32.685 --> 22:35.229
-Please.
-You seem to forget, Jean-Guy.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.857
You were once my project.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.443
Yeah.

23:00.004 --> 23:02.423
Is this where Madame de Poitiers
was sitting?

23:02.840 --> 23:05.927
Uh, yes. Yeah, right there, sir.

23:06.803 --> 23:10.973
-And how do we know she was electrocuted?
-Her hands and feet were scorched.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.685
-Yeah.
-Where did the heater get its power from?

23:14.769 --> 23:16.312
A generator.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.149
[Nichol] Maybe they attached it
to Madame de Poitiers.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.526
[Lacoste] She would have noticed.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.736
[Nichol] Not if she was
watching the curling.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.572
-[Beauvoir] People like it that much?
-[Nichol] Around here, they do.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.825
[Lacoste] Maybe the heater is faulty.

23:29.325 --> 23:33.121
It's metal. She could've touched it,
been electrocuted and stumbled back.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.752
What are booster cables
doing near a curling rink?

23:39.836 --> 23:42.171
Maybe Agent Nichol is onto something.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.090
[Gamache]
Maybe the killer used the generator

23:44.173 --> 23:47.260
to electrocute
Madame de Poitiers intentionally.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.138
But if I'm right,

23:51.013 --> 23:53.391
why would the killer
choose to murder someone

23:53.474 --> 23:55.601
in such an elaborate and public way?

23:58.646 --> 24:01.899
That's a lot of hate.
Who's the next of kin?

24:08.739 --> 24:11.325
Who makes a home where children suffered?

24:13.786 --> 24:15.121
[Nichol] Huh?

24:16.122 --> 24:17.832
It's an old residential school

24:18.916 --> 24:20.084
for Indigenous kids.

24:20.168 --> 24:22.920
Well, clearly,
it didn't bother our victim.

24:25.882 --> 24:29.844
[Gamache] Call the pathology lab,
find out when we can expect the report.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.518
-Sergeant.
-[Lacoste] Thanks.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.478
[in French]
Hi, Jean-Guy Beauvoir speaking.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.689
[in French]
I'm calling to see if you have news

24:42.273 --> 24:43.649
What's your progress?

24:44.442 --> 24:45.443
-[banging on door]
-[In English] Someone's there.

24:45.610 --> 24:46.986
[door locked]

24:48.321 --> 24:50.823
-Should we break it down?
-This is not a movie.

24:50.907 --> 24:53.201
Step back.
There's a grieving family inside.

24:53.284 --> 24:54.577
Okay.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.167
Chief Inspector Gamache.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.586
Sorry, I was in the attic.

25:05.087 --> 25:06.130
Come in.

25:08.466 --> 25:09.508
Hello.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.471
[door closes]

25:16.849 --> 25:18.309
My daughter, Crie.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.520
These are police officers.
Please say hello.

25:21.812 --> 25:22.772
Hello, Crie.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.857
My name's Armand Gamache.

25:26.108 --> 25:29.070
-I'm very sorry about your mother.
-She's in shock.

25:29.737 --> 25:30.947
We both are.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.367
Perhaps we could speak
somewhere privately.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.493
Crie won't mind.

25:36.786 --> 25:38.579
-But I will.
-Okay.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.790
Just through here.

25:42.625 --> 25:43.751
Stay with her.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.800
It was a stressful time for CC,

25:51.926 --> 25:53.928
with her first book coming out.

25:54.595 --> 25:55.972
I already have a copy.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.266
Agent Nichol is a fan.

25:58.349 --> 26:01.352
-I wouldn't say a fan...
-I haven't read mine yet.

26:02.395 --> 26:05.856
Perhaps you could give us the gist
of your wife's philosophy.

26:06.691 --> 26:10.695
It's about
keeping your emotions in, trapped.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.448
Like white paint on the wall.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.953
Though not on the wall,

26:19.036 --> 26:20.663
Li Bien.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.500
Beneath the wall, on the inside.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.170
What time did she leave
on the day of the curling match?

26:28.254 --> 26:30.339
I'm not sure. Early.

26:31.299 --> 26:34.385
She went there with a colleague,
Saul Petrov.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.887
-The portrait photographer?
-Yeah.

26:37.388 --> 26:42.727
He lives in Montreal,
but he has a rental here for the holidays.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.353
For CC.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.148
-For CC?
-To photograph her.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.525
He took that.

26:52.403 --> 26:56.115
He's documenting her life
for her next book.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.203
Did he take any photographs
of the curling?

27:01.287 --> 27:02.538
Yes.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.124
Spends a lot of time with your wife?

27:07.293 --> 27:08.627
It's not what you think.

27:08.711 --> 27:12.214
He may have taken a photograph
of the person who killed her.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.927
Can you think of anyone
who might have wanted to harm her?

27:18.220 --> 27:20.931
CC wasn't the easiest person
to get along with.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.476
She was impatient.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.227
She didn't suffer fools.

27:26.062 --> 27:28.606
I'm sure she ruffled
a few feathers around here,

27:28.689 --> 27:32.234
but that doesn't mean anyone
would want to kill her, does it?

27:35.780 --> 27:37.698
I need to talk to your daughter.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.410
Merci.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.221
[Gamache] Crie?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.307
May I sit?

28:16.612 --> 28:17.947
I lost my mother...

28:19.740 --> 28:21.992
when I was a little younger than you.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.745
My father too.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.042
-Were you sad?
-Yeah.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.090
Yes, I was very, very sad.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.471
I can't tell you that the pain will stop.

28:44.557 --> 28:48.394
But I promise you, you'll survive this.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.148
I can't take away the hurt, but...

28:53.983 --> 28:57.069
I can help you understand
what happened to your mother.

28:59.155 --> 29:02.241
Grief sometimes feels like fear,
doesn't it?

29:04.285 --> 29:05.578
But it's not.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.165
Grief is...

29:10.833 --> 29:11.750
love.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.922
Love with no place to go.

29:41.197 --> 29:45.284
Tomorrow we need to get statements
from everybody at the curling match.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.452
Friends and family?

29:46.535 --> 29:50.456
True. And also we have to track down
that photographer, Saul Petrov.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.166
Update on the pathology report?

29:52.249 --> 29:53.501
Ready in the morning.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.461
Good. And a situation room.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.172
Nichol, perhaps you can help,
as you're a local.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.049
-Yeah, sure thing.
-Good.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.800
And, now what do we do?

30:01.884 --> 30:02.718
Now?

30:03.677 --> 30:06.764
Well, no murder was ever solved
on an empty stomach.

30:19.235 --> 30:21.987
[all chattering and laughing]

30:24.323 --> 30:25.699
[chattering stops]

30:28.744 --> 30:31.080
-Bonsoir.
-Bonsoir.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.624
We were hoping for a table.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.547
How long was he there?

30:39.630 --> 30:41.549
He was in on it.

30:41.632 --> 30:43.801
[all chattering]

30:44.009 --> 30:47.346
-Excuse me, but... that's CC, isn't it?
-Mm-hmm.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.391
-Who's the artist?
-Clara Morrow.

30:50.474 --> 30:53.185
She's local.
We have a big artistic community.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.771
-Can I meet her?
-You're in luck.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.566
Hey, Clara. You've got yourself a fan.

30:59.817 --> 31:01.193
Oh...

31:02.403 --> 31:04.405
[Gamache] Sorry to interrupt. I'm sorry.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.156
-Gamache.
-Clara Morrow.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.408
Did you paint this?

31:07.908 --> 31:10.744
From a photograph.
She didn't have time to sit.

31:11.161 --> 31:13.956
[Gamache] There's so much going on
beneath the surface.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.499
Just like CC.

31:15.583 --> 31:19.420
-Oh, did you know her well?
-No, only a little, but, um...

31:20.879 --> 31:22.548
she seemed so perfect.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.509
But there was something underneath.

31:27.136 --> 31:30.764
It's like when you paint over
an old painting that you hated,

31:30.848 --> 31:32.933
and everyone tells you they love it

31:33.017 --> 31:36.854
but you know that if you chipped away
at that top layer of oil,

31:36.937 --> 31:39.273
that old painting, it'd still be there.

31:39.356 --> 31:40.733
Mmm.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.110
Well, it's very beautiful.

31:43.777 --> 31:45.904
As if you can see inside her soul.

31:47.156 --> 31:49.992
I had no idea
law enforcement knew so much about art.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.493
[laughs]

31:53.120 --> 31:55.039
Of course, my wife is a huge talent.

31:56.165 --> 31:57.416
Yet to be discovered.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.586
Mmm.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.880
-Very nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.761
Guess who found the best situation room?

32:08.844 --> 32:09.762
Good work.

32:12.765 --> 32:13.932
Buckle up, everyone.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.186
None of us is going anywhere.

32:17.561 --> 32:20.272
[suspenseful music playing]

32:34.912 --> 32:37.831
What do you think? It's perfect, right?

32:42.670 --> 32:43.754
Hello!

32:46.131 --> 32:47.132
[Gamache] This is your place?

32:47.216 --> 32:48.967
Be Calm is a cultural centre,

32:49.885 --> 32:53.013
serving mostly Iotenen'tón:ni
Mohawk community.

32:53.097 --> 32:55.265
Iotenen'tón:ni? That's near Three Pines?

32:55.349 --> 32:57.518
Just a couple of miles that way.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.649
-Are you ready to see that other space?
-Yes.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.492
I sometimes use this room
for crafting workshops,

33:14.076 --> 33:18.664
but nobody much comes here
before the thaw. So...

33:21.125 --> 33:23.127
Thank you, madam. This is perfect.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.963
People around here call me Bea.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.341
Did you, by any chance,
know CC de Poitiers?

33:30.008 --> 33:32.261
Her book and this place share a name.

33:33.262 --> 33:36.974
Oh. Be Calm's been here 20 years.

33:37.057 --> 33:42.646
CC de Poitiers, not so long.
Must be a coincidence.

34:08.005 --> 34:11.341
Unusual choice for a native woman, SQ.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.926
[chuckles]

34:13.010 --> 34:14.011
Yeah.

34:14.094 --> 34:17.806
I had this crazy idea
that I could change things...

34:18.724 --> 34:20.768
-from the inside.
-Mmm.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.227
How's it going for you?

34:22.811 --> 34:24.146
[chuckles]

34:25.314 --> 34:27.441
Uh, you know.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.360
Who are your people?

34:34.323 --> 34:35.699
[sighs]

34:36.700 --> 34:37.826
I don't know.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.830
I was adopted when I was a year old. So...

34:42.998 --> 34:44.291
Oh...

34:54.092 --> 34:57.513
Sir, according to
CC's credit card statements,

34:57.596 --> 35:00.808
she's paid for many hotel rooms
in Montreal the past year.

35:00.891 --> 35:04.394
Even when she was living there
before she moved to Three Pines.

35:04.478 --> 35:07.564
I think someone was getting
a little afternoon delight.

35:07.648 --> 35:10.275
Get a full list
of where she stayed and when,

35:10.901 --> 35:12.861
and times she checked in and out.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.571
Right on it, sir.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.199
Any forensics on the jumper cable?

35:17.908 --> 35:19.117
No, nothing.

35:19.910 --> 35:24.206
But it's a very common brand,
found in any garage in the province.

35:24.289 --> 35:27.876
And it was long enough to run
between CC and the generator,

35:27.960 --> 35:29.545
so it could've been used.

35:31.380 --> 35:34.174
For the victim to die,
four things had to happen.

35:34.591 --> 35:38.762
CC had to be standing in water,
her hands had to be bare,

35:38.846 --> 35:42.432
and she had to touch the only thing
that was electrified.

35:42.516 --> 35:47.062
The current had to run through her body,
out of her feet and into the water.

35:48.522 --> 35:51.441
Do we know what the blue puddle
under the seat was?

35:51.525 --> 35:52.943
It's washer fluid.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.029
It must have been spilled deliberately.

35:56.113 --> 35:58.574
Washer fluid has no place
on a curling rink.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.075
So what was it doing there?

36:03.745 --> 36:08.917
Electricity, it's like a living thing.
It's desperately seeking to stay alive.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.545
It races from one form to another.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.840
Through metal, through the body,
into the earth.

36:15.632 --> 36:18.218
When CC's hand touched the source,

36:18.302 --> 36:22.347
her heart would have given in in seconds,
only she had to be grounded.

36:22.431 --> 36:23.432
Impossible.

36:23.515 --> 36:27.436
The sole on her snow boots
would have protected her from the shock.

36:28.770 --> 36:31.356
Except she wasn't wearing
rubber-soled boots.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.527
Look at these soles.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.613
[Nichol] Metal claws.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.907
So, CC was standing in the puddle

36:39.990 --> 36:43.535
created by the washer fluid
with metal claws on her boots.

36:43.619 --> 36:46.246
The killer turned her seat
into an electric chair.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.708
Madame de Poitiers was executed.

36:59.343 --> 37:00.469
[bird caws]

37:04.765 --> 37:08.644
[suspenseful music playing]

37:11.772 --> 37:12.814
[Lacoste] Patron?

37:17.235 --> 37:18.445
You have something?

37:18.946 --> 37:22.199
An address for that photographer,
Saul Petrov.

37:24.326 --> 37:27.287
He's at a rental
half a mile from CC's place.

37:27.371 --> 37:29.498
The hotel where she got those rooms,

37:29.581 --> 37:32.876
the staff says he looks like the guy
she's been with.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.127
Let's pay him a visit.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.758
[mellow music playing]

38:02.614 --> 38:05.075
[Saul] CC thought it would be easier
if I was close.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.159
Easier for what?

38:07.160 --> 38:09.037
To finish work on her new book.

38:09.329 --> 38:11.331
I was taking pictures for it.

38:11.415 --> 38:14.543
Your relationship with CC
was just a working thing or...

38:14.626 --> 38:16.336
Strictly professional.

38:16.420 --> 38:17.838
She paid for this place.

38:19.131 --> 38:20.799
And hotel rooms in Montreal,

38:21.591 --> 38:23.802
checked in and out of during the day.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.889
-Was she meeting you?
-Me? No.

38:28.724 --> 38:29.933
I'm a married man.

38:30.017 --> 38:33.020
We have the dates,
so we can check the security footage

38:33.103 --> 38:35.272
at the Ritz Montreal, if it's... easier.

38:35.355 --> 38:38.650
Okay, we did meet there,
but only to talk about work.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.694
Twice a week for a year?

38:43.822 --> 38:45.532
I took what I could get.

38:46.575 --> 38:48.535
What were you photographing?

38:48.618 --> 38:49.661
CC, of course.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.999
Couldn't get enough
of photographing that face.

38:55.250 --> 39:00.172
She wanted pictures with the community,
wanted to feel like she was part of it.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.841
but I don't think
they felt like she fitted in.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.093
They made her feel like an outsider.

39:05.177 --> 39:09.431
-You take photos of the curling match?
-Yeah. A few.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.141
We'll need to see those.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.366
And don't leave Three Pines.

39:29.868 --> 39:30.827
Sure.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.623
[suspenseful music playing]

39:37.209 --> 39:39.836
[in French]
CC ate in the bistro a handful of times.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.172
She always complained about something.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.549
The fish was too bony, sauce too rich.

39:44.633 --> 39:47.886
I only ever dealt with her as a customer
to be honest.

39:47.969 --> 39:51.598
I think Myrna knew her quite well though.

39:51.681 --> 39:54.810
[in English] I mean, we had
a few conversations about her book,

39:54.893 --> 39:58.563
and how many copies she thought
I needed to order for the store.

39:58.647 --> 39:59.773
[chuckles]

39:59.856 --> 40:02.526
She lived in an old residential school.

40:03.151 --> 40:06.113
You think she'd be interested
in a cultural centre?

40:06.488 --> 40:08.990
CC had asked Sophie
to play at the book launch.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.450
I was excited to do it.

40:10.534 --> 40:13.537
And we were both thrilled at the prospect,

40:13.620 --> 40:16.289
but she was a little critical
of Sophie's playing.

40:16.373 --> 40:21.253
We felt it best that we kind of passed
on that opportunity.

40:22.963 --> 40:28.468
I painted her,
but, um, she didn't have time to sit.

40:29.469 --> 40:30.971
Um...

40:31.054 --> 40:34.057
She was really interested
in Peter's work, really.

40:34.307 --> 40:37.727
We talked about art
for that huge house of hers

40:37.811 --> 40:41.273
and, uh, discussed
our favourite galleries.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.275
She did stay at the B&B.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.152
Yeah, like a year ago.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.361
Yeah, about a year ago.

40:46.486 --> 40:47.487
Um...

40:47.571 --> 40:48.572
Great review.

40:48.697 --> 40:50.407
-Yeah.
-Yeah, fun.

40:51.575 --> 40:52.701
[chuckles]

40:53.160 --> 40:56.580
She seemed a little cold,
if I am being honest.

40:57.497 --> 41:01.418
I didn't get the impression
that she and her husband were happy.

41:02.544 --> 41:04.546
In truth, I barely knew the woman.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.675
She wasn't actually interested
in oldies like us.

41:08.758 --> 41:09.593
No.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.761
[both laughing]

41:11.845 --> 41:13.013
[both] Mmm.

41:14.598 --> 41:16.057
What the fuck do you want?

41:17.350 --> 41:19.728
Ruth Zardo, may we come in?

41:32.532 --> 41:33.992
[duck quacks]

41:48.757 --> 41:50.550
[duck quacks]

41:50.800 --> 41:55.138
"Forget what? Your sadness, your shadow,

41:56.097 --> 41:59.100
what was done to you
the day of the lawn party

41:59.184 --> 42:02.270
when you came inside,
flushed with the sun,

42:02.354 --> 42:04.981
your mouth sulky with sugar,

42:05.065 --> 42:09.903
and said to yourself in the bathroom,
I am not the favourite child."

42:11.738 --> 42:12.656
Forgive me,

42:13.365 --> 42:15.283
my wife and I, we're huge fans.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.703
I live out here to avoid huge fans.

42:20.747 --> 42:23.166
-Will this take long?
-[Beauvoir whispers] Let's hope not.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.753
What can you tell us about CC de Poitiers?

42:27.212 --> 42:28.880
-Not much.
-But you knew her.

42:28.964 --> 42:30.382
No better than anyone else.

42:31.633 --> 42:35.220
She only moved into that monstrosity
a couple of months back.

42:35.762 --> 42:37.514
Place stood empty for years.

42:38.098 --> 42:39.224
Then CC bought it.

42:39.474 --> 42:40.558
[groans]

42:42.394 --> 42:46.314
You can tell a lot about a person
by the way they feel about birds.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.483
CC hated them too.

42:49.067 --> 42:52.904
Can you tell us about the curling?
You were the first responder.

42:52.988 --> 42:56.032
CC fucking died. What's to tell?

42:56.116 --> 43:00.537
Or perhaps you saw something or someone
near her just before?

43:02.330 --> 43:03.331
Not a thing.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.335
Frankenstein, interesting choice.

43:08.003 --> 43:08.878
Are we done?

43:09.713 --> 43:12.215
CC was murdered, Madame Zardo.

43:15.468 --> 43:17.554
[duck quacks]

43:19.347 --> 43:23.184
And I'm late for book club,
Chief inspector.

43:25.812 --> 43:28.815
[mellow music playing]

43:54.341 --> 43:55.675
[Ruth groaning]

43:56.593 --> 43:57.844
Gotcha!

44:00.722 --> 44:03.183
[people chattering]

44:15.653 --> 44:17.906
-[bone cracks]
-[man] That is so gross.

44:21.618 --> 44:23.078
We're actually closed.

44:23.453 --> 44:25.747
Can I help you, Chief Inspector?

44:26.206 --> 44:27.624
I'm hoping you can all help.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.752
I was struggling to get a sense of...

44:30.835 --> 44:33.505
A sense of what CC de Poitiers
was really like.

44:33.588 --> 44:36.466
What do you want from us?
Her fucking life story?

44:37.717 --> 44:38.968
[Clara] We barely knew her.

44:39.469 --> 44:40.678
But you painted her.

44:40.762 --> 44:44.057
CC was going to show Clara's work
to an influential friend,

44:44.140 --> 44:45.517
but it came to nothing.

44:46.184 --> 44:47.811
The painting was a thank you.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.312
Not that she even wanted it.

44:49.396 --> 44:52.232
CC was damaged,
she wouldn't know how to be grateful.

44:52.315 --> 44:54.067
So you weren't a fan either.

44:56.361 --> 44:59.239
A lot of you are saying
you barely knew her, but...

44:59.739 --> 45:01.908
I'm hearing she upset a lot of people.

45:03.076 --> 45:08.206
She was upset with you, wasn't she, Myrna?
When you wouldn't host her book signing.

45:09.916 --> 45:13.253
When she wanted her launch party
at the bistro, you refused.

45:13.336 --> 45:16.005
The next day you closed down
for an inspection

45:16.089 --> 45:18.383
because of a report of food poisoning.

45:18.633 --> 45:23.847
So you see, a lot of you seem to know her
a lot better than you're letting on.

45:25.974 --> 45:29.269
Anyway, if you think of anything
that we should know,

45:29.352 --> 45:30.687
you could contact us.

45:31.896 --> 45:35.358
We'll be at Be Calm.
If not, you can call me.

45:38.653 --> 45:41.573
Hey, Chief, I'll tell you something.

45:42.073 --> 45:45.243
This village is
the most welcoming place on Earth.

45:45.952 --> 45:47.704
But if you don't belong here,

45:47.787 --> 45:50.832
Three Pines will find you out
and chase you out,

45:51.458 --> 45:52.750
one way or another.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.254
Good night.

45:59.382 --> 46:00.550
[door closes]

46:00.633 --> 46:01.676
That told them.

46:02.469 --> 46:03.761
[all laughing]

46:04.471 --> 46:06.014
And that's how you do it.

46:07.682 --> 46:10.185
[eerie music playing]

46:28.578 --> 46:30.121
[cell phone vibrating]

46:32.040 --> 46:34.959
-Pierre?
-So you still out in the sticks?

46:35.043 --> 46:36.127
Yes, still here.

46:36.211 --> 46:39.047
You dig anything up
on the Blue Two-Rivers case?

46:39.130 --> 46:42.509
I told you they were last seen
getting into Kevin Kis' truck, right?

46:42.592 --> 46:44.636
-Right.
-Well, that truck

46:44.719 --> 46:49.224
was picked up by a traffic cam
crossing Brooklyn Bridge two weeks ago.

46:49.307 --> 46:52.602
Then, again, entering Red Rook.
That's a project in Brooklyn.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.729
A lot of guns, a lot of drugs.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.481
I had this officer check out

46:56.564 --> 46:59.817
every social media post
with a Red Rook hashtag on that date.

46:59.901 --> 47:02.403
-You got something?
-Pinging it to you.

47:07.700 --> 47:08.910
It's Blue and Tommy.

47:08.993 --> 47:11.496
We're trying to track
the kid who posted it.

47:11.579 --> 47:13.706
I don't know how to thank you.

47:13.790 --> 47:17.001
Reine-Marie's poutine
and a games night ought to do it.

47:17.252 --> 47:18.253
[chuckles] Small price.

47:19.379 --> 47:21.464
Tell the Two-Rivers the good news.

47:21.548 --> 47:22.549
Thanks, Pierre.

47:26.678 --> 47:29.681
I have to go to the Mohawk community
at Pine Ridge.

47:29.764 --> 47:30.682
Iotenen'tón:ni?

47:30.765 --> 47:33.726
I need to speak to the family
of Blue Two-Rivers.

47:33.810 --> 47:36.187
Did you get clearance from Francoeur?

47:36.271 --> 47:38.815
-In that case, I'm coming with you.
-Thanks.

47:38.898 --> 47:41.901
[somber music playing]

47:45.488 --> 47:47.574
[Gamache] We have some
good news about Blue.

47:48.241 --> 47:52.287
This photograph was taken two weeks ago
in a Brooklyn housing project.

47:52.370 --> 47:55.290
We're looking into who posted it
for more information.

47:55.582 --> 47:57.375
-She's alive?
-Yeah.

47:59.168 --> 48:02.964
We know you've been let down before,
but you can trust us.

48:04.507 --> 48:07.176
If she was alive,
she would have called us.

48:07.885 --> 48:11.139
-We don't have all the answers.
-She would have called.

48:11.264 --> 48:14.559
What was Tommy's relationship like
with his brother Kevin?

48:14.642 --> 48:18.688
Close. Their mother died years back,
only had each other.

48:18.938 --> 48:21.858
Kevin put food in his mouth
and clothes on his back.

48:21.941 --> 48:24.694
[Gamache] We know he didn't
make his money by the book.

48:25.737 --> 48:30.450
According to who? He was perfectly within
his rights to sell cigarettes tax-free.

48:30.533 --> 48:31.701
Not legally.

48:31.784 --> 48:33.995
[woman] Our laws are different.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.372
Because he made a living his own way

48:36.456 --> 48:38.291
within the shitty hand that your country

48:38.374 --> 48:41.044
dealt us, you labelled that a crime.

48:41.544 --> 48:42.920
[scoffs]

48:43.004 --> 48:46.633
Is it possible that Tommy persuaded Blue
to leave to go away with him?

48:46.716 --> 48:47.884
And leave her baby?

48:49.052 --> 48:50.845
No, no way.

48:51.220 --> 48:55.141
I've realized that people
can do the most unexpected things.

48:56.017 --> 48:58.144
Perhaps it all got too much for her?

48:58.227 --> 49:01.606
Oh, because we're native,
we're child abusers and abandoners?

49:01.689 --> 49:05.193
No, I don't think that.
It can't be easy being a young mother.

49:05.276 --> 49:09.530
Pearl is everything to Blue.
She was trying to secure their future.

49:09.614 --> 49:10.615
This isn't right.

49:12.325 --> 49:16.663
She was starting college in the fall.
She worked really hard to get her GED.

49:18.206 --> 49:21.000
She was wearing this in Brooklyn
two weeks ago.

49:21.084 --> 49:23.211
Can't be hanging in her closet, can it?

49:27.507 --> 49:30.134
[Gamache] It's impossible to know
if that's the same jacket.

49:30.218 --> 49:31.886
What would you rather believe?

49:31.969 --> 49:34.722
That your kid's dead,
or they don't need you anymore?

49:34.806 --> 49:36.182
We've got to trace her.

49:36.891 --> 49:38.976
Put out an APB, New York State.

49:39.394 --> 49:41.688
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

49:42.563 --> 49:43.564
[car alarm beeps]

49:47.902 --> 49:49.112
[brakes screech]

50:18.099 --> 50:19.976
[blows air]

50:26.357 --> 50:27.859
-[bird screeches]
-[Gamache gasps]

50:32.739 --> 50:33.948
[gasps]

50:34.031 --> 50:35.825
[panting]

50:44.667 --> 50:46.169
[sighs]

50:47.837 --> 50:50.840
[suspenseful music playing]

51:47.271 --> 51:51.150
A smell of burning
filled the startled air.

51:53.152 --> 51:57.490
CC de Poitiers was no longer there.

51:58.324 --> 52:00.535
[laughing]

52:02.703 --> 52:05.206
Best fucking barbecue I've ever been to.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.853
[door opens]

52:28.437 --> 52:29.856
[church bell tolling]

52:31.983 --> 52:35.486
Sir, sir. Why did you do that?

52:35.570 --> 52:37.238
Why'd you move the pictures?

52:37.321 --> 52:38.948
Because they all hated her.

52:39.198 --> 52:40.700
Every single one of them.

52:40.783 --> 52:43.286
But did any of them have an actual motive?

52:43.911 --> 52:47.248
She hurt each and every one of them,
one way or another.

52:47.331 --> 52:50.042
Okay, but which one of them did it?

52:50.126 --> 52:52.712
Have you read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein?

52:53.004 --> 52:54.964
I'm not much of a reader, sir.

52:55.089 --> 52:56.215
Mmm.

52:56.299 --> 52:59.844
"The monster is dead,
and the villagers are celebrating."

53:00.428 --> 53:01.804
Huh?

53:01.888 --> 53:06.058
In the story, the villagers aren't just
celebrating the death of the monster.

53:06.475 --> 53:08.311
They killed him themselves.

53:09.812 --> 53:11.814
So, what if it was all of them?

53:35.588 --> 53:37.590
[closing theme music playing]
