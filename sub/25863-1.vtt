01:32.826 --> 01:36.178
I ask no favor for my sex.

01:36.615 --> 01:38.865
All I ask of our brethren...

01:39.584 --> 01:42.865
is that they take their feet off
our necks.

02:08.116 --> 02:13.530
Twenty-six, 25, 24, 23,
21, 20, 19

02:22.376 --> 02:25.110
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

02:34.662 --> 02:39.208
- How's your health?
- Uh, I'm feeling just fine.

02:40.715 --> 02:43.123
Here now to comment
is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

02:45.647 --> 02:48.990
It's an amazing thing
to see somebody in her 80s

02:49.030 --> 02:52.388
- become such an icon.
- Do you mind signing this copy?

02:52.707 --> 02:56.186
I am 84 years old and everyone
wants to take a picture with me.

02:56.498 --> 02:59.482
She is really when you come
right down to it,

02:59.647 --> 03:01.755
the closest thing
to a superhero, I know.

03:06.677 --> 03:09.670
They call her Notorious RBG,
that's her rap name.

03:09.759 --> 03:11.392
- Notorious R...
- RBG.

03:11.474 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, no, no, RGB... RBG right.

03:17.763 --> 03:18.892
Supreme Court Justice,

03:18.927 --> 03:20.894
Ruth Bader Ginsburg getting
a lot of attention

03:20.930 --> 03:23.113
after she delivered
a scathing dissent.

03:23.149 --> 03:25.566
Whether you agree with her
or not, you got to acknowledge

03:25.602 --> 03:27.269
she's been a force
on that Court.

03:27.305 --> 03:29.210
Liberal hero,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

03:29.246 --> 03:30.675
As much as people admire her,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.111
they don't even know
the half of it.

03:32.888 --> 03:34.820
She was the queen.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.263
Ruth knew what she was doing

03:36.298 --> 03:37.855
in laying the foundation.

03:38.117 --> 03:41.867
To put women on
exactly the same plane as men.

03:42.023 --> 03:43.370
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

03:43.406 --> 03:47.008
quite literally changed the way
the world is for American women.

03:47.234 --> 03:52.891
Twelve, 11, ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five...

03:53.531 --> 03:56.607
Today the Senate
judiciary committee welcomes

03:56.643 --> 03:58.410
judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

03:58.960 --> 04:01.225
the president's nominee
to be associate justice

04:01.261 --> 04:03.508
of the 'United States Supreme Court'.

04:14.633 --> 04:18.291
Judge do you swear the testimony
you are about to give

04:18.327 --> 04:20.668
will be the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

04:20.704 --> 04:21.742
so help you God?

04:21.894 --> 04:24.422
- I do, Mr. Chairman.
- Thank you.

04:26.104 --> 04:30.086
I am a Brooklynite,
born and bred...

04:31.234 --> 04:34.945
a first-generation American
on my father's side...

04:35.609 --> 04:38.611
barely second-generation
on my mother's.

04:39.774 --> 04:42.915
What has become of me
could happen...

04:43.364 --> 04:45.297
only in America.

04:53.825 --> 04:57.318
Neither of my parents had
the means to attend college,

04:57.818 --> 05:01.066
but both taught me
to love learning...

05:01.980 --> 05:03.915
to care about people...

05:04.552 --> 05:09.497
and to work hard for whatever
I wanted or believed in.

05:11.669 --> 05:15.012
My father was from Odessa

05:15.048 --> 05:17.082
and during his growing up years,

05:17.279 --> 05:20.719
Jews were no longer admitted
to the Russian schools.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.189
Education
was terribly important.

05:25.786 --> 05:28.943
My mother was loving
but also very strict,

05:29.536 --> 05:34.154
making sure I that I did my...
homework, practice the piano,

05:34.251 --> 05:37.310
didn't stay out jumping rope
too long.

05:39.860 --> 05:41.818
I loved to do the things
that boys did,

05:41.854 --> 05:43.099
when I was growing up.

05:43.599 --> 05:46.529
One of our favorite things
was climbing garage roofs

05:46.822 --> 05:48.981
from one roof to another,
leaping...

05:50.125 --> 05:51.292
leaping over.

05:51.974 --> 05:54.591
Justice Ginsburg,
we cannot call Ruth.

05:54.927 --> 05:56.888
- Right.
- We call her Kiki.

05:57.902 --> 05:59.182
She was beautiful.

05:59.380 --> 06:02.336
Big beautiful blue eyes,
which you really can't see

06:02.372 --> 06:06.224
very well behind her glasses,
very soft brown hair.

06:07.099 --> 06:09.458
She had this kind
of quiet magnetism

06:09.795 --> 06:11.919
even though she was
not effusive.

06:11.974 --> 06:14.298
You always
thought that she wasn't listening

06:14.333 --> 06:16.505
and that she didn't know
what was going on

06:16.579 --> 06:18.443
but she knew what was going on.

06:18.551 --> 06:20.700
- She didn't do small talk.
- No, no small talk.

06:20.736 --> 06:23.891
And she didn't do girl chat
and she didn't get on the phone

06:23.927 --> 06:26.512
and talk with us about what
happened on the weekend.

06:26.548 --> 06:28.185
She's a deep thinker.

06:30.013 --> 06:31.207
- She's an only child.
- No...

06:31.243 --> 06:33.978
She had a sister, I didn't know
her sister.

06:34.380 --> 06:36.349
- Her sister passed away.
- Right.

06:37.107 --> 06:39.380
But she and her mom
were very close,

06:39.521 --> 06:41.233
very, very close.

06:42.411 --> 06:46.038
My mother died when I was 17.

06:47.036 --> 06:49.990
I wish I could've had her...
longer.

06:53.138 --> 06:56.341
Well, her mother must have been
a very steely person

06:56.377 --> 06:59.450
because she had cancer
a long time

07:00.082 --> 07:01.818
and... and lived

07:01.966 --> 07:05.357
trying to get her child
through high school.

07:06.599 --> 07:09.466
We were supposed to be
at graduation.

07:09.849 --> 07:13.610
And then the night before
we got a message

07:13.646 --> 07:16.266
that she would not be able
to be part of this.

07:16.302 --> 07:19.107
We knew then that her mother had
passed away.

07:20.341 --> 07:26.111
She had two... lessons
that she repeated over and over.

07:26.876 --> 07:28.513
"Be a lady..."

07:28.979 --> 07:31.281
and "be independent."

07:32.005 --> 07:36.446
"Be a lady" meant don't allow
yourself to be overcome

07:36.482 --> 07:39.625
by useless emotions like anger.

07:40.693 --> 07:43.228
And by "independent,"
she meant...

07:44.536 --> 07:47.789
it would be fine if you met
prince charming

07:47.825 --> 07:51.002
and lived happily ever after.
But...

07:52.449 --> 07:54.521
be able to fend for yourself.

07:56.896 --> 08:02.102
In my lifetime, I expect to see
three, four,

08:02.138 --> 08:05.927
perhaps even more women
on theHigh Court bench.

08:06.404 --> 08:09.240
Women not shaped
from the same mold,

08:09.646 --> 08:12.123
but of different complexions.

08:13.740 --> 08:17.200
I surely would not be
in this room today...

08:18.224 --> 08:20.466
without the determined efforts

08:20.943 --> 08:26.338
of men and women who kept dreams
of equal citizenship alive.

08:28.357 --> 08:32.043
I have had the great good
fortune to share life...

08:32.565 --> 08:34.154
with a partner.

08:35.138 --> 08:38.450
Truly extraordinary
for his generation...

08:40.419 --> 08:44.267
a man who believed at age 18,
when we met,

08:45.120 --> 08:47.188
that a woman's work,

08:47.333 --> 08:50.560
whether at home or on the job...

08:51.259 --> 08:54.904
is as important as a man's.

08:56.794 --> 09:00.605
I became a lawyer... in days...

09:01.485 --> 09:03.500
when women were not wanted

09:03.536 --> 09:06.378
by most members
of the legal profession.

09:07.990 --> 09:12.435
I became a lawyer because Marty
supported that choice...

09:12.743 --> 09:14.083
unreservedly.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.419
So what was it about Marty?

09:30.599 --> 09:34.368
Marty and I met
when I was 17, he was 18.

09:34.818 --> 09:36.615
I was in college.

09:39.216 --> 09:41.911
Cornell was a preferred school for...

09:42.352 --> 09:43.685
for daughters.

09:49.224 --> 09:54.529
In those days, there was
a strict quota for women.

09:55.099 --> 09:58.463
There were four men
to every woman...

09:59.849 --> 10:03.990
so for parents, Cornell was
the ideal place to send a girl.

10:05.263 --> 10:08.275
If she couldn't find
her man there, she was hopeless.

10:10.801 --> 10:16.029
My first semester at Cornell,
I never did a repeat date.

10:22.310 --> 10:24.615
But then I met Marty,
and there was something

10:24.651 --> 10:26.865
amazingly wonderful
about this man.

10:27.880 --> 10:32.164
He was the first boy I ever knew
who cared that I had a brain.

10:32.825 --> 10:36.185
Most guys in the '50s didn't.

10:38.121 --> 10:41.071
One of the sadnesses
about the brilliant girls

10:41.107 --> 10:45.122
who attended Cornell is
that they kind of suppressed

10:45.552 --> 10:47.107
how smart they were.

10:47.942 --> 10:52.438
But Marty was so confident
of his own ability...

10:53.263 --> 10:55.427
so comfortable with himself,

10:55.849 --> 10:59.841
that he never regarded me
as any kind of a threat.

11:00.818 --> 11:05.388
We all were struck
by the tremendous difference

11:05.427 --> 11:08.255
between Marty... and Ruth.

11:09.333 --> 11:14.240
Marty was the most gregarious,
outgoing, life-of-the-party.

11:15.581 --> 11:18.349
Ruth was a really quite...

11:19.310 --> 11:20.912
recessive in a way...

11:22.474 --> 11:28.349
shy, quiet, soft voice
but they worked, they worked.

11:39.363 --> 11:41.531
Oh, he's so young.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.672
Meeting Marty...

11:45.708 --> 11:49.372
was by far the most fortunate
thing that ever happened to me.

11:50.068 --> 11:53.240
Marty was a man blessed
with a wonderful sense of humor.

11:53.693 --> 11:55.677
I tend to be rather sober.

11:59.505 --> 12:03.911
In those days, it was not
a great time for our country.

12:04.396 --> 12:07.880
There was a red scare abroad
in the land.

12:08.184 --> 12:09.833
Are you a member
of the communist party

12:10.104 --> 12:12.629
or have you ever been a member
of the communist party?

12:13.318 --> 12:15.883
It's unfortunate and tragic
that I have to teach

12:15.919 --> 12:18.499
this committee
the principles of Americanism.

12:18.535 --> 12:20.246
That's not the question.

12:20.403 --> 12:22.458
I had a government professor

12:22.544 --> 12:26.427
and he wanted me to see
that our country was straying

12:26.463 --> 12:28.730
from its most basic values

12:28.965 --> 12:30.375
by some of our politicians

12:30.411 --> 12:33.465
who were seeing a communist
in every closet.

12:33.784 --> 12:35.539
But that there were lawyers,

12:35.575 --> 12:38.997
who were defending the rights
of these people to think,

12:39.036 --> 12:41.825
to speak, to write freely.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.296
Stand away from the stand!

12:44.332 --> 12:46.218
Fight for the bill of rights
you're trying to destroy.

12:46.253 --> 12:48.386
Officer, take this
man away from the stand.

12:50.012 --> 12:53.682
And then I got the idea
that you could do something

12:53.839 --> 12:57.175
that would make your society
a little better.

12:58.856 --> 13:01.862
My family had some reservations
about this...

13:02.862 --> 13:07.667
but then when I married
at the end of college,

13:07.737 --> 13:11.523
my family said, if she wants
to be a lawyer let her try.

13:12.245 --> 13:14.345
If she can't succeed...

13:14.716 --> 13:17.495
she will have a husband
to support her.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.469
That's me waiting to get
my diploma, very happy.

13:24.004 --> 13:27.231
- Yeah, see? That's a nice one.
- That's cute. Yeah.

13:27.832 --> 13:30.994
So, we have a whole slew
of pictures.

13:31.434 --> 13:33.794
They took them from every
possible angle.

13:34.620 --> 13:35.840
You know who that is?

13:36.616 --> 13:37.049
No.

13:37.084 --> 13:40.934
- It's Dean Minow.
- Oh. Dean Minow is so small.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.856
We're the same height!

13:42.892 --> 13:45.051
She's not that small,
she's probably taller than you.

13:45.087 --> 13:46.224
There's somebody in there.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.703
My brother and
cousins and I all call her bubbe.

13:48.739 --> 13:51.450
It's the Yiddish word
for grandmother.

13:51.544 --> 13:54.028
It's what we've always
called bubbe.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.028
- Bubbe!
- Yes?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.840
Do you know if you have
fake sugar like Splenda

14:00.019 --> 14:03.481
- or sweet and low?
- Yes, it should be someplace...

14:03.677 --> 14:04.848
That's helpful.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.366
I feel like I have

14:06.434 --> 14:09.468
my grandmotherly relationship
with her but also somewhat

14:09.504 --> 14:12.739
of a student scholarly
relationship to her as well now.

14:12.981 --> 14:15.221
She taught me that the way
to win an argument

14:15.256 --> 14:16.536
is not to yell.

14:16.614 --> 14:19.945
Because often that will turn
people away more so,

14:19.981 --> 14:21.629
than bringing them
to your table.

14:21.737 --> 14:24.304
I don't know what that says...

14:25.064 --> 14:25.731
I can't tell if...

14:25.766 --> 14:29.083
for extraordinary dedication
to the Harvard Law School

14:29.197 --> 14:30.833
and efforts on its behalf.

14:30.926 --> 14:33.434
You know, this was
the 200th year of Harvard.

14:33.715 --> 14:36.973
So, it took 200 years for us...
We were the first class

14:37.009 --> 14:38.642
that was 50/50 women.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.715
So 50 percent men...
we were the first class.

14:42.273 --> 14:44.419
It takes 200... no. Yeah.

14:53.137 --> 14:55.928
Women did not come
into the Harvard Law School

14:55.963 --> 14:57.997
until the very early '50s.

14:58.793 --> 15:02.134
Two percent was about what
it was back then.

15:02.887 --> 15:06.762
How did it feel to be one
of nine women in a class of...

15:08.415 --> 15:10.238
over 500 men?

15:14.473 --> 15:17.216
You felt you were constantly
on display.

15:17.777 --> 15:19.718
So if you were called on
in class,

15:20.301 --> 15:22.902
you felt that, if you didn't
perform well,

15:23.488 --> 15:26.725
that you were failing not just
for yourself but for all women.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.328
You also had
the uncomfortable feeling

15:29.363 --> 15:31.324
that you were being watched.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.819
American antitrust policy...

15:33.855 --> 15:35.000
Harvard was a Socratic method.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.769
So the professor would ask
a question

15:36.804 --> 15:39.340
and then you would be called on
to answer.

15:39.785 --> 15:42.209
The way it worked with women
was they didn't call on us.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.989
I think they were afraid,
we would sort of wither

15:44.024 --> 15:46.553
if we were subjected
to that kind of questioning.

15:47.887 --> 15:50.613
When I was sent to check
a periodical, in Lamont Library

15:50.649 --> 15:53.678
in the old periodical room.

15:54.313 --> 15:55.396
There was...

15:55.670 --> 15:58.420
a man at the door and he said,
"you can't come in."

15:58.631 --> 16:00.967
"Well, why can't I come in?"
"Because you're a female."

16:01.163 --> 16:05.545
There was nothing I could say,
this was a university employee,

16:05.599 --> 16:08.358
you can't come into that room.

16:09.459 --> 16:11.830
And then there was
the Dean's famous dinner

16:11.866 --> 16:13.906
for the women in the
first year class.

16:14.639 --> 16:18.959
He asked each of us to stand up
and tell him what we were doing

16:19.464 --> 16:20.810
taking a seat...

16:21.498 --> 16:23.577
that could be occupied by a man.

16:25.338 --> 16:27.639
There were many indignities

16:27.678 --> 16:31.397
that one took as just part
of the scenery the way it was.

16:37.489 --> 16:38.690
When I got to Harvard Law School

16:38.725 --> 16:41.010
and I'm really
intimidated first year,

16:41.046 --> 16:42.064
Marty was saying,

16:42.100 --> 16:44.681
"Oh my wife. She's going to be
on the 'Law Review'."

16:44.717 --> 16:48.764
There was a woman in the class
ahead of mine and she said,

16:49.491 --> 16:51.713
"this husband of
yours is boasting"

16:51.749 --> 16:53.045
that you're going to be
on the 'Law Review',

16:53.080 --> 16:54.780
"you look like a little twerp!"

16:55.467 --> 16:58.392
To make the' Law Review',
in those days you had to be

16:58.428 --> 17:04.209
in the top 25 academically,
of 530, 540.

17:05.077 --> 17:07.935
Her second year she makes
the 'Law Review'.

17:08.357 --> 17:12.663
So the mere fact marked her
as something special.

17:14.313 --> 17:15.638
It turned out,

17:15.935 --> 17:19.637
that I did very well
the first year and I attributed

17:20.209 --> 17:23.608
to having something
very important in my life

17:23.644 --> 17:25.944
that wasn't the law books.

17:28.686 --> 17:32.920
I came to Harvard as the mother
of a 14 month old child.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.303
I'd go to school...

17:36.856 --> 17:38.314
study as hard as I can,

17:38.350 --> 17:41.994
in a very concentrated way,
I didn't waste any time.

17:42.733 --> 17:45.772
Four o'clock in the afternoon
our babysitter left

17:46.100 --> 17:47.366
and that was...

17:47.936 --> 17:50.530
my child's hours till she went...

17:51.404 --> 17:52.413
to sleep.

17:54.504 --> 17:56.249
Playing with my daughter

17:56.803 --> 17:57.985
gave me a respite

17:58.021 --> 18:01.631
from the kind of work
I was doing at law school...

18:02.615 --> 18:05.030
and I think made me more sane.

18:09.025 --> 18:11.021
We knew that Marty was ill.

18:11.795 --> 18:14.727
We just knew he had
his own battle

18:15.444 --> 18:19.295
and Ruth is now caring
for both Marty and Janey.

18:21.053 --> 18:23.811
Marty in his third
year of law school

18:24.418 --> 18:26.194
had a virulent cancer

18:27.053 --> 18:29.994
in days when
there was no chemotherapy,

18:30.030 --> 18:32.155
there was only massive radiation.

18:34.850 --> 18:36.618
He'd go for the radiation,

18:37.232 --> 18:38.828
wake up about midnight

18:38.864 --> 18:41.975
when the only food that
he ate for the day

18:42.851 --> 18:44.567
he could manage.

18:46.163 --> 18:49.995
And then I started typing
the notes that his classmates

18:50.030 --> 18:51.697
had given me from his classes,

18:52.358 --> 18:56.384
reading whatever cases
I would read for the next day

18:56.420 --> 18:59.116
and maybe I got two hours sleep.

19:00.239 --> 19:01.784
She did her own work,

19:01.820 --> 19:03.405
helped her husband
with his work,

19:03.545 --> 19:06.413
organized his friends so they
could help him with his work

19:06.506 --> 19:08.670
and took care
of her two year old child.

19:09.615 --> 19:11.772
Fortunately Marty lived...

19:12.303 --> 19:15.944
but it's when she learned how to
burn the candle at both ends.

19:32.725 --> 19:35.188
One of the memories
of my childhood would be

19:35.224 --> 19:37.002
waking up in the middle
of the night

19:37.038 --> 19:39.627
and there mom would be spread
out over the dining room table

19:39.663 --> 19:45.314
with her legal pads, uh, and,
uh, the coffee in one hand,

19:45.350 --> 19:47.117
and the box of prunes
at the other.

19:47.499 --> 19:52.891
She will work until two, three,
four, five in the morning

19:52.926 --> 19:55.561
sometimes even, uh, later,

19:56.124 --> 19:58.416
then she will get up,
she has a sitting

19:58.452 --> 20:01.233
she would have to be
at the Court before nine,

20:01.900 --> 20:03.936
and then she sleeps
the entire weekend.

20:05.023 --> 20:06.286
So she catches up.

20:09.069 --> 20:11.643
The sweet
thing about working for a justice

20:11.678 --> 20:13.189
who works extremely hard

20:13.225 --> 20:16.428
is that we saw Marty come
to chambers often...

20:16.964 --> 20:19.032
to lure her home.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.322
He would say, "Ruth, it's time
to come home to dinner."

20:23.874 --> 20:27.178
She sometimes had to be
physically brought home.

20:30.139 --> 20:33.232
Marty graduated
from the Harvard Law School

20:33.631 --> 20:36.602
and was going to a firm
in New York.

20:37.288 --> 20:40.014
That was when Ruth finished
her second year,

20:40.761 --> 20:41.761
given Marty,

20:41.842 --> 20:45.319
given his recent illness,
they had to remain together,

20:45.379 --> 20:47.212
and the logical place
was New York

20:47.247 --> 20:49.381
and the best option
was Columbia.

20:52.014 --> 20:54.319
When I graduated
from Columbia law school

20:54.355 --> 20:55.874
in 1959,

20:56.553 --> 21:00.147
not a law firm in the entire
city of New York

21:00.299 --> 21:01.686
would employ me.

21:03.163 --> 21:06.564
Four of us
from my class, Marty's class,

21:06.600 --> 21:07.866
went to the same law firm

21:08.475 --> 21:11.342
and two of us went
to the hiring partner

21:12.108 --> 21:13.538
and said...

21:14.030 --> 21:16.174
we had somebody on the
Harvard Law Review

21:16.209 --> 21:18.710
that we think is the cat's meow,

21:18.999 --> 21:21.592
we think this firm should hire her.

21:22.709 --> 21:25.491
As soon as I used the "she"
pronoun...

21:26.881 --> 21:29.786
the senior partner looked at me
and says, "young man..."

21:30.374 --> 21:32.444
you don't seem to understand.

21:32.975 --> 21:34.795
"This firm doesn't hire women."

21:35.508 --> 21:37.975
She hadn't quite figured out,

21:38.190 --> 21:40.235
why it was that there were
these barriers.

21:40.271 --> 21:43.368
It wasn't until later
that this all came together

21:43.403 --> 21:46.138
- and became her life's work in,
- yes.

21:46.399 --> 21:48.896
In fighting these injustices.

21:50.451 --> 21:53.599
Being a woman was an impediment.

21:57.516 --> 21:59.151
We did not have equal rights

21:59.186 --> 22:02.654
and equal recognition
in the law at all.

22:03.801 --> 22:07.491
There were not
hundreds but thousands of state

22:07.527 --> 22:11.691
and federal laws all over
this country that discriminated

22:11.732 --> 22:12.965
on the basis of gender.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.268
Typical laws of the time like,

22:16.770 --> 22:23.108
"the husband is the master
of the community."

22:23.660 --> 22:27.488
He shall choose where the family
will live

22:28.069 --> 22:31.965
"and the woman is
obliged to follow him."

22:54.805 --> 22:57.474
There's no aspect
of American life

22:57.715 --> 23:00.045
in which you were not
treated differently.

23:00.301 --> 23:01.762
The idea was that...

23:02.488 --> 23:05.645
men were the breadwinners
that counted

23:06.087 --> 23:07.707
and women were...

23:08.454 --> 23:10.145
pin money earners.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.872
So women woke up and complained.

23:16.150 --> 23:21.177
♪ One of these mornings ♪

23:21.400 --> 23:29.400
♪ You're gonna rise,
rise up singing ♪

23:31.520 --> 23:37.554
♪ You're gonna spread your wings, ♪

23:37.644 --> 23:43.358
♪ Child and take, take to the sky ♪

23:43.460 --> 23:46.570
♪ Lord, the sky ♪

23:46.973 --> 23:51.270
There came to be such a mass
and a majority of women really

23:51.551 --> 23:55.239
who understood that
they were not crazy,

23:55.278 --> 23:56.703
the system was crazy.

23:56.739 --> 24:00.070
Now, thanks to the
spirit of equality in the air,

24:00.106 --> 24:03.241
I no longer accept
society's judgment

24:03.424 --> 24:05.379
that my group is second class.

24:07.122 --> 24:09.447
But marching and demonstrating

24:09.483 --> 24:11.168
just wasn't Ruth's thing.

24:11.770 --> 24:15.497
Her thing was to use the skills
she had and put them to work

24:15.922 --> 24:18.028
and those were her legal skills.

24:18.184 --> 24:22.094
In 1963, she started at Rutgers
as a law professor.

24:22.613 --> 24:25.079
And really inspired
by her students,

24:25.137 --> 24:26.707
she agreed to teach a course

24:26.801 --> 24:29.201
in this new subject of
gender and law.

24:29.236 --> 24:30.936
In the late 60's,

24:31.676 --> 24:35.278
some of the students wanted
a course in women and the law.

24:35.876 --> 24:37.840
That's also when...

24:37.997 --> 24:41.580
she began dealing
with sex discrimination cases.

24:42.231 --> 24:46.062
And that was her entré
into becoming a litigator.

24:46.848 --> 24:49.965
The emergence
of a women's rights movement

24:50.207 --> 24:54.707
had the possibility of playing
the role in the 1970s

24:54.778 --> 24:58.029
that the black civil rights
movement had played

24:58.064 --> 24:59.262
in the 1960s.

24:59.575 --> 25:03.869
And so I was particularly eager
to create a special project

25:03.904 --> 25:05.762
dealing with women's rights.

25:05.918 --> 25:09.707
I got a call from the WACLU
asking me if I would consider

25:09.747 --> 25:11.461
running the women's rights
project

25:11.497 --> 25:13.661
with professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

25:13.864 --> 25:15.814
Whom I had heard
of but I did not know.

25:16.450 --> 25:18.457
I met Ruth the first day
I was there.

25:18.551 --> 25:23.188
She seemed very polite and quiet
and reserved. Not a firebrand.

25:23.918 --> 25:27.661
She wouldn't speak up
a great deal during meetings.

25:27.879 --> 25:30.715
She always addressed
whatever point there was.

25:30.770 --> 25:34.012
There wasn't any peripheral
element of it.

25:34.590 --> 25:36.590
- No small talk.
- No small talk.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.450
None that I can recall.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.109
At that point in time,

25:42.145 --> 25:45.143
Ruth was developing
her philosophy to take cases

25:45.178 --> 25:46.645
that would make good law.

25:46.997 --> 25:50.176
If the case is going to be
on its way to the Supreme Court,

25:50.450 --> 25:53.185
we wanted to be involved
and we wanted to...

25:53.220 --> 25:55.453
Frankly, take over the case.

25:56.205 --> 25:57.573
She was following
in the footsteps

25:57.608 --> 25:59.958
of the great civil rights lawyer
Thurgood Marshall, who was

26:00.395 --> 26:03.528
the architect of the battle
for racial equality

26:03.840 --> 26:06.298
basing it on the clause
of the Constitution

26:06.333 --> 26:09.403
that guarantees equal
protection of the law.

26:09.918 --> 26:13.801
She wanted it to apply
to equal protection for women.

26:15.442 --> 26:18.465
My first argument before
the U.S. Supreme Court

26:18.745 --> 26:21.418
was in Frontiero v. Richardson.

26:29.161 --> 26:33.317
 I was, way back in the 1970s, a...

26:33.848 --> 26:35.629
second lieutenant in the air force.

26:37.504 --> 26:40.899
I went in the military
because I needed the money.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.375
Who says a woman
has to settle for a routine job

26:44.411 --> 26:45.918
just because she's a woman?

26:46.012 --> 26:49.754
Discover the United States air force
and you'll discover the world.

26:50.309 --> 26:53.421
I was newly out
of college, this was a new job,

26:53.457 --> 26:56.497
I had just married, so
it was the start of

26:57.106 --> 26:58.351
new everything.

27:00.739 --> 27:05.507
It became clear pretty quickly
that the men I was working with

27:05.543 --> 27:07.742
who were married got
a housing allowance

27:07.778 --> 27:10.328
and I wasn't getting paid
a housing allowance

27:10.363 --> 27:12.106
'cause I was a woman.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.200
I assumed it was a mistake

27:16.020 --> 27:20.411
so I went off to the pay office
to correct the mistake.

27:21.145 --> 27:23.341
"You're lucky we let you
in here at all.

27:24.028 --> 27:27.979
You're lucky that the air force
allows you to serve,"

27:28.528 --> 27:31.239
was what I heard
right off the bat.

27:31.418 --> 27:33.250
It took me aback and then
I figured,

27:33.286 --> 27:37.968
well you know, here's one bigot,
so I'll just keep asking around

27:38.004 --> 27:39.958
and it became very clear
very quickly

27:39.993 --> 27:42.193
that there was no
different story.

27:42.942 --> 27:46.351
So we went to see a lawyer
and I still thought it was

27:46.387 --> 27:49.520
a matter of getting a lawyer
to write a letter for me.

27:49.731 --> 27:52.031
Just write a letter,
have the right information.

27:52.067 --> 27:54.817
I'm clearly in the same
category as these other men.

27:55.343 --> 27:56.641
The lawyer said to me,

27:56.676 --> 27:58.848
"this isn't an administrative error."

27:59.098 --> 28:00.126
This is the law

28:00.473 --> 28:02.879
and it's going to have to
be rectified with a lawsuit

28:03.121 --> 28:05.424
"and if you're willing,
we'll take you on."

28:05.997 --> 28:08.090
Ruth and I heard about it

28:08.457 --> 28:12.324
and immediately let the lawyer
for Sharron frontiero

28:12.359 --> 28:13.817
know we were interested.

28:13.957 --> 28:17.067
It was very important to us
to have a part in that case.

28:17.855 --> 28:19.695
Nice girls didn't file lawsuits.

28:19.731 --> 28:23.902
Particularly after they had been
let into the service at all.

28:23.937 --> 28:25.500
You know, what more did I want?

28:25.536 --> 28:28.231
Well, I just wanted to be
treated like everybody else did.

28:28.278 --> 28:31.231
But there was the sense
and there still is the sense,

28:31.301 --> 28:33.122
that nice girls don't speak up,

28:33.507 --> 28:35.707
nice girls don't make demands.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.303
Ah well,

28:40.207 --> 28:41.293
too bad.

28:42.467 --> 28:45.036
It went to the District Court
in Alabama.

28:45.325 --> 28:49.728
We lost and the next Court
to go to was the Supreme Court.

28:50.426 --> 28:53.786
Ruth and I set to work
to write the brief.

28:54.028 --> 28:57.046
I would write a section
and Ruth would take it

28:57.082 --> 29:00.832
and it would come back in
a wonderfully brilliant fashion.

29:01.090 --> 29:02.984
Every word of it
was carefully...

29:03.020 --> 29:05.668
I mean Ruth went over
every single word.

29:08.984 --> 29:11.965
What we wanted was
a review of cases

29:12.348 --> 29:15.253
that the Court would say, sex
discrimination doesn't work.

29:16.028 --> 29:19.059
And it would be a broad command
basically to legislatures

29:19.179 --> 29:22.793
to get rid of statutes
that discriminate on the basis

29:23.023 --> 29:24.957
of... of gender.

29:25.442 --> 29:29.489
But she also added to make
the point much more poignant,

29:29.567 --> 29:32.028
the history of women and
the way we were treated

29:32.078 --> 29:34.872
throughout America
and its beginnings.

29:53.407 --> 29:56.343
She captured for the
male members of the Court

29:56.379 --> 29:58.465
what it was like to be
a second class citizen.

30:13.670 --> 30:16.059
Frontiero went to the Court.

30:16.575 --> 30:18.616
Ruth Ginsburg, for the first time,

30:18.651 --> 30:20.231
made an oral argument.

30:20.316 --> 30:22.585
She split her time with the lawyer,

30:22.661 --> 30:25.786
the man who had begun the case
in Alabama.

30:28.984 --> 30:31.262
It was an afternoon argument.

30:32.049 --> 30:34.012
So I was first up
in the afternoon

30:34.048 --> 30:36.994
and I didn't dare have lunch
that day.

30:37.704 --> 30:39.286
She seemed nervous.

30:39.363 --> 30:42.160
Her eyes were wide with sort
of anticipation.

30:47.090 --> 30:52.848
It's very intense and austere
and important

30:53.386 --> 30:54.593
and very male

30:54.629 --> 30:56.286
and it's the whole thing
feels like.

30:57.176 --> 30:59.754
I was... I was really kind
of scared.

31:01.418 --> 31:03.466
We sat down at the counsel table

31:03.770 --> 31:06.364
and had all these huge casebooks

31:06.399 --> 31:08.566
for me to help her with cites.

31:08.965 --> 31:12.036
And the Court began
with the " Oyez! Oyez!"

31:12.072 --> 31:14.391
and the "here we are."

31:15.106 --> 31:18.582
Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!

31:19.217 --> 31:20.629
All persons having business

31:20.665 --> 31:22.562
before the Supreme Court
of the United States

31:22.598 --> 31:25.450
are admonished to draw near
and give their attention

31:25.485 --> 31:27.348
for the Court is now sitting.

31:29.918 --> 31:33.458
- Mrs. Ginsburg.
- I was terribly, terribly

31:33.494 --> 31:35.293
nervous but then I looked up

31:35.777 --> 31:37.293
at the justices

31:38.332 --> 31:41.379
and I thought,
"I have a captive audience."

31:42.222 --> 31:44.623
I knew that I was speaking
to men,

31:44.770 --> 31:46.804
who didn't think
there was any such thing

31:46.840 --> 31:49.307
as gender-based discrimination.

31:49.950 --> 31:53.653
And my job was to tell them
it really exists.

32:51.075 --> 32:55.615
There was not a single question.
I just went on speaking

32:55.942 --> 32:57.927
and I, at the time...

32:59.099 --> 33:00.462
wondered,

33:00.498 --> 33:04.561
"are they just indulging
me and not listening"

33:05.536 --> 33:07.396
or am I telling them something

33:08.044 --> 33:09.620
they haven't heard before

33:09.656 --> 33:11.591
"and are they paying attention?"

33:13.685 --> 33:16.419
The justices were
just glued to her.

33:16.696 --> 33:18.161
I don't think they were

33:18.271 --> 33:21.318
expecting to have to deal
with something as powerful

33:21.357 --> 33:26.391
as a sheer force of her argument
that was just all-encompassing

33:26.427 --> 33:28.641
and they were there to talk
about a little statute

33:28.677 --> 33:31.541
in the government code.
I mean, it was just...

33:31.615 --> 33:35.200
we seized the moment
to change American society.

33:37.021 --> 33:39.250
In asking the Court
to declare sex

33:39.285 --> 33:41.386
a suspect criterion...

33:42.274 --> 33:47.302
we urge a position forcibly
stated in 1837 by Sara Grimke,

33:47.922 --> 33:49.189
noted abolitionist

33:49.853 --> 33:52.234
and advocate of equal rights
for men and women.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.151
She said,

33:54.273 --> 33:57.371
"I ask no favor for my sex."

33:58.313 --> 34:00.453
"All I ask of our brethren"

34:01.236 --> 34:04.797
"is that they take their feet
off our necks."

34:11.119 --> 34:13.021
We were told about the decision

34:13.056 --> 34:14.703
when a reporter called us up

34:14.739 --> 34:17.487
and said, "it went in your favor
today, how do you feel?"

34:17.911 --> 34:20.489
I said, "I feel fine,
thank you very much!"

34:20.590 --> 34:22.407
We were both happy
that we won the case.

34:22.443 --> 34:24.629
Let's be clear about it,
we won the case. But...

34:25.380 --> 34:28.849
we lost the standard of review
that we wanted by one vote.

34:29.614 --> 34:32.513
She tried to make the case,

34:33.114 --> 34:34.906
that sex discrimination
should be treated

34:34.940 --> 34:36.357
like race discrimination.

34:37.146 --> 34:40.745
Four justices signed
onto that idea.

34:41.077 --> 34:42.949
The problem was you need five.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.349
I said...

34:47.185 --> 34:48.886
it's too soon.

34:49.955 --> 34:52.496
My expectation, to be candid,

34:52.810 --> 34:55.677
was that I would repeat
that kind of argument...

34:57.662 --> 34:59.669
maybe half a dozen times.

34:59.958 --> 35:03.935
I didn't expect it to happen
in one fell swoop.

35:04.654 --> 35:08.583
I think generally
in our society, real change...

35:10.224 --> 35:13.529
enduring change,
happens one step at a time.

35:13.669 --> 35:17.148
The legal strategy of one step
at a time in the '70s

35:17.183 --> 35:19.282
was a conservative strategy

35:19.318 --> 35:22.997
but the goal was equality
and civil rights

35:23.474 --> 35:26.318
and that's who she always was
and who she is now.

35:33.427 --> 35:37.701
She is very
disciplined but she has passions

35:37.737 --> 35:39.888
that she really enjoys.

35:40.663 --> 35:41.943
She loves the opera.

35:44.833 --> 35:46.982
She goes to multiple
opera festivals

35:47.018 --> 35:49.154
and the whole family
will go with her.

35:50.068 --> 35:52.774
I think it is a place
of tranquility

35:52.810 --> 35:56.193
that is outside of the demands
of her job.

36:11.131 --> 36:14.221
When I am at an opera...

36:14.894 --> 36:16.774
I get totally carried away.

36:17.573 --> 36:21.276
I don't think about the case
that's coming up next week,

36:21.391 --> 36:23.589
or the brief
that I'm in the middle of.

36:26.935 --> 36:30.979
I'm overwhelmed by the beauty
of the music, the drama.

36:32.263 --> 36:34.619
And the sound of
the human voice...

36:35.370 --> 36:38.386
it's like an electric current
going through me.

36:56.420 --> 37:00.862
Justice and mercy,
they're all in opera.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.722
Very grand emotions.

37:13.751 --> 37:16.370
A young man had
a tragic experience.

37:17.089 --> 37:20.206
His wife Hadan
entirely healthy pregnancy,

37:20.440 --> 37:24.011
and he was told that he had
a healthy baby boy

37:24.047 --> 37:26.081
but his wife had died.

37:27.042 --> 37:29.764
The
problem was amniotic embolism

37:29.800 --> 37:32.917
and at that particular point
nobody had ever survived that.

37:33.323 --> 37:35.542
They did keep her alive
for about four hours

37:36.022 --> 37:37.956
but by 3:30 in the afternoon,

37:38.042 --> 37:40.534
the code blue came along
and she died.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.769
Jason was a very easy child.

37:47.651 --> 37:50.276
My attitude towards raising
a child is that,

37:50.526 --> 37:53.550
a child is not there for me,
I'm there for him!

37:53.773 --> 37:55.394
And that's what my job was.

37:55.667 --> 37:57.408
He determined that he was
going to be

37:57.443 --> 38:00.120
a care-giving parent
to that child.

38:01.073 --> 38:03.764
He went to the local
social security office

38:03.800 --> 38:06.636
and asked about the benefits
he thought...

38:08.026 --> 38:10.386
a sole surviving parent
could get.

38:11.167 --> 38:12.034
And he was told,

38:12.070 --> 38:14.269
"well, that benefit is called
a mother's benefit,"

38:15.514 --> 38:17.299
and he didn't qualify.

38:18.096 --> 38:20.464
So, he wrote a letter
to the editor

38:20.503 --> 38:22.581
"of his local newspaper.
And he said,"

38:22.628 --> 38:26.104
"I have heard a lot about women's
lib. Let me tell you my story."

38:26.940 --> 38:28.089
"To the editor."

38:28.125 --> 38:30.075
It has been my
misfortune to discover

38:30.323 --> 38:32.743
that a male cannot collect
social security benefits

38:32.778 --> 38:33.894
as a woman can.

38:34.019 --> 38:35.948
Had I been paying
into the social security system

38:36.026 --> 38:39.317
and had I died, she would have
been able to receive a benefit.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.017
But male homemakers cannot.

38:41.302 --> 38:43.792
I wonder if Gloria Steinem knows
about this.

38:47.511 --> 38:52.612
Ruth took a case in which a man
was discriminated against

38:52.648 --> 38:54.081
in order to show...

38:54.761 --> 38:58.792
the depth and the importance
of sex discrimination.

38:59.741 --> 39:01.976
Very intelligent thing to do.

39:02.979 --> 39:06.573
We appeared in the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1975.

39:08.144 --> 39:10.581
When we got to the courtroom,
she sat me down

39:10.616 --> 39:11.917
at the table with her,

39:12.448 --> 39:15.401
she just wanted a male presence
to be at that table

39:15.464 --> 39:18.190
so that the justices would have
something to identify with.

39:18.745 --> 39:20.628
That was a part of her strategy.

39:21.065 --> 39:22.565
She was trying to convince

39:22.908 --> 39:24.862
members of the Supreme Court who

39:25.237 --> 39:29.323
were mostly white, male,
privileged class at that time.

39:48.615 --> 39:50.616
She knew exactly
what she was doing

39:50.698 --> 39:52.761
and it was a very shrewd
strategy.

39:53.992 --> 39:59.030
That case resulted
in a unanimous judgment

39:59.065 --> 40:01.532
in Stephen Wiesenfeld's favor.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.115
His case was the perfect example

40:04.151 --> 40:09.276
of how gender-based
discrimination hurts everyone.

40:10.433 --> 40:13.537
Ruth's
conception of the strategy led

40:13.573 --> 40:16.667
to a whole string of litigation
for the next decade.

40:17.729 --> 40:23.167
She wanted to build
the idea of women's equality

40:23.214 --> 40:26.819
step by step to use each case

40:27.495 --> 40:29.979
to move things forward.

40:30.206 --> 40:32.706
It was like knitting a sweater.

41:17.386 --> 41:18.357
They didn't get it.

41:18.393 --> 41:21.145
They didn't understand the
issues that women were facing

41:21.181 --> 41:23.914
or they didn't see them
as issues.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.511
'Cause women had, in their minds
women had a place

41:27.878 --> 41:29.211
and it wasn't...

41:30.026 --> 41:33.104
where Ruth Ginsburg was
suggesting that it ought to be.

41:46.112 --> 41:48.339
When they would say
things like this,

41:48.374 --> 41:50.261
how did you respond?

41:50.347 --> 41:53.477
Well, never in anger,
as my mother told me.

41:53.565 --> 41:56.113
That would've been
self-defeating.

41:56.148 --> 42:00.317
Always as an opportunity
to teach.

42:00.776 --> 42:03.287
I did see myself as kind
of a kindergarten teacher,

42:03.323 --> 42:06.183
in those days,
because the judges...

42:07.144 --> 42:10.354
didn't think sex...
sex discrimination existed.

42:11.722 --> 42:15.003
Well, one of the things I tried
to plant in their minds was...

42:15.886 --> 42:19.436
think about how you would like
the world to be

42:19.472 --> 42:21.464
for your daughters
and granddaughters.

42:30.261 --> 42:33.714
One of the things that I'm
struck by, as I look back on it,

42:33.964 --> 42:37.688
is how unprepared the defendants
were to fight back.

42:37.886 --> 42:40.487
We won because the strategy was
brilliant,

42:40.565 --> 42:44.225
we won because we were smart
and prepared and we fought hard.

42:44.261 --> 42:47.598
You couldn't miss what Ruth
was doing during the '70s.

42:47.784 --> 42:53.667
She was creating
a legal landscape.

43:01.683 --> 43:04.886
She was doing something
that was...

43:05.450 --> 43:07.065
incredibly important

43:07.101 --> 43:10.519
to American women whether
they knew it or not.

43:14.729 --> 43:17.690
Just the thought that I might
catch a glimpse of her is...

43:17.896 --> 43:19.196
overwhelming.

43:19.471 --> 43:21.717
I have a mug of her
in my room it says,

43:21.753 --> 43:22.904
"her story in the making."

43:22.940 --> 43:24.584
I have her sticker
on my computer!

43:24.620 --> 43:26.479
I just ordered tons of merch.

43:26.808 --> 43:30.464
Notorious RBG. We're here to get
our books signed.

43:30.808 --> 43:33.440
I think it's
easy to take for granted

43:33.542 --> 43:38.912
the position that young women
can have in today's society.

43:38.948 --> 43:42.901
And that's a lot in thanks
to justice Ginsburg's work.

43:44.440 --> 43:47.658
Who is more
disdained or told to go away

43:47.693 --> 43:48.815
than an older woman?

43:48.870 --> 43:51.962
But here's an older woman
who people really want to hear

43:51.997 --> 43:53.800
everything that she has to say.

43:55.472 --> 43:57.390
I have been given
questions from the students

43:57.425 --> 44:00.037
about what it's like to be
justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

44:00.550 --> 44:02.253
- Do you have a smartphone?

44:02.490 --> 44:06.248
Yes, the answer is yes.

44:06.284 --> 44:09.139
I had, in fact,
two until they took

44:09.448 --> 44:11.443
the BlackBerry away
from me saying,

44:11.479 --> 44:13.009
"nobody uses that anymore."

44:14.383 --> 44:17.347
Uh, what do I use it for?
Not for selfies.

44:20.124 --> 44:22.287
You have said in public
many times,

44:22.323 --> 44:24.828
that the ideal number of women
for the Supreme Court

44:24.863 --> 44:26.430
of the United States is nine.

44:26.535 --> 44:28.042
Yes, of course...

44:29.166 --> 44:30.808
- Uh...
- Why not?

44:31.050 --> 44:35.172
Nine men was a satisfactory
number until 1981.

44:35.722 --> 44:39.065
But the change in the
federal judiciary as a whole

44:39.101 --> 44:40.972
has been enormous.

44:41.479 --> 44:43.180
But it wasn't until...

44:43.440 --> 44:45.308
Jimmy Carter became president,

44:46.112 --> 44:48.752
he looked around
at the federal judiciary,

44:49.308 --> 44:50.370
and he said,

44:50.708 --> 44:52.604
"don't they all look like me?"

44:53.292 --> 44:57.292
"But that's not how the great
United States looks."

44:59.112 --> 45:01.897
When president Carter
was elected, he said,

45:01.933 --> 45:04.428
"there are almost no women
and there are almost"

45:04.464 --> 45:07.026
no African Americans
on the federal bench

45:07.065 --> 45:09.573
"and I am determined
to change that."

45:10.972 --> 45:14.175
Justice Ginsburg and I
were two of the people

45:14.783 --> 45:17.112
who benefitted
from that promise.

45:19.104 --> 45:22.854
Ruth was nominated in 1980
and we became colleagues

45:22.956 --> 45:25.892
on the U.S. Court of appeals
for the DC circuit.

45:26.994 --> 45:29.463
Judge Ginsburg did you
always want to be a judge?

45:31.572 --> 45:36.166
The law is something
that I think I deal with well.

45:36.499 --> 45:37.499
Uh...

45:38.119 --> 45:41.438
I don't have the kind of talent
that could make one say

45:41.473 --> 45:43.822
a great opera singer.

45:52.849 --> 45:56.016
I wanted to be active
in the law.

45:56.541 --> 45:59.580
The law is a consuming,

46:00.152 --> 46:01.152
uh,

46:01.801 --> 46:03.505
love for me.

46:04.841 --> 46:06.809
When she first started
on the bench,

46:06.845 --> 46:10.392
after we hear cases we go
into a conference room

46:10.447 --> 46:13.556
and the three judges confer
and we think about

46:13.872 --> 46:15.739
how we should decide the cases.

46:16.572 --> 46:19.853
Ruth was sufficiently confident
in herself in the early days.

46:20.236 --> 46:22.775
"She would say," this is
a very straightforward case.

46:22.900 --> 46:24.915
I have a prepared judgment
for us"

46:24.950 --> 46:28.298
and this was before we
conferred on the case

46:28.400 --> 46:30.753
and initially, we were
all taken aback like,

46:31.111 --> 46:33.228
"no wait, wait, Ruth, you can't
do that."

46:33.691 --> 46:34.491
She was always right,

46:34.526 --> 46:36.527
the judgments that she had
prepared were right.

46:37.369 --> 46:40.544
But we said, "no, we have to go
through the motions"

46:40.580 --> 46:44.134
of talking first before you give
us the result."

46:45.359 --> 46:48.562
When I was appointed
to the DC circuit,

46:48.658 --> 46:51.239
"so often people would
come up to me and say,"

46:51.275 --> 46:54.755
"it must be hard for you commuting
back and forth to New York."

46:55.248 --> 46:59.502
They couldn't imagine that
a man would leave his work

46:59.852 --> 47:02.072
to follow his... his wife.

47:03.377 --> 47:07.291
He... had been
extraordinarily successful

47:07.326 --> 47:09.908
as a practicing lawyer
in New York.

47:10.229 --> 47:12.083
There were people who would say,

47:12.119 --> 47:14.864
he was the best tax lawyer
in the city of New York

47:14.900 --> 47:17.181
and believe me, that is saying
something.

47:17.370 --> 47:18.662
He was...

47:19.837 --> 47:21.900
okay playing second fiddle.

47:22.064 --> 47:24.963
In fact, he would make a joke
of it always, he would say,

47:25.384 --> 47:28.178
"I moved to Washington
because my wife got a good job."

47:28.673 --> 47:31.486
How much advice
do you give each other?

47:38.336 --> 47:39.503
Well...

47:41.142 --> 47:44.094
Marty was the funny one
in the family and she loved it

47:44.884 --> 47:47.831
and you could see the twinkle
in her eye when he would do

47:47.866 --> 47:49.838
his funny little quips
and jokes.

47:49.968 --> 47:51.223
As a general rule,

47:51.259 --> 47:54.822
my wife does not give me
any advice about cooking

47:54.861 --> 47:57.541
and I do not give her any advice
about the law.

47:57.884 --> 48:00.634
This seems to work quite well
on both sides.

48:02.189 --> 48:06.294
My father was very outgoing,
very fun person,

48:06.330 --> 48:08.400
and I think he helped, uh,

48:09.001 --> 48:12.666
temper some of mom's seriousness
at times which I think was

48:12.702 --> 48:14.052
to everybody's benefit.

48:14.088 --> 48:16.560
We used to keep a book called
mommy laughed.

48:16.735 --> 48:19.478
Which had parsimonious entries.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.365
You are giving me
constant advice.

48:22.401 --> 48:24.931
It's starts calling about, uh...

48:25.861 --> 48:30.056
7:00, it's time to come home
for dinner and then 7:30

48:30.572 --> 48:35.312
and somewhere between 7:30
and 9:00, we generally make it.

48:35.955 --> 48:38.259
And the other thing is time
for you to go to sleep.

48:39.159 --> 48:40.778
Those are the daily...

48:40.814 --> 48:42.564
um, that's the daily advice,

48:43.442 --> 48:44.275
that I get.

48:44.361 --> 48:47.958
Well, it's not that bad advice
you have to eat one meal a day

48:47.993 --> 48:49.853
and you have to go to sleep
sometime.

48:50.861 --> 48:55.832
He allowed Ruth to be
who she was, that is,

48:56.330 --> 49:00.439
a relatively reserved,
serious person,

49:00.916 --> 49:04.556
who focused on her law work
and loved doing that.

49:04.736 --> 49:07.711
And the relationship was just
magnificent to watch.

49:08.424 --> 49:11.814
And when Marty was
starting out in law practice

49:12.084 --> 49:13.825
and eager to make partner,

49:13.861 --> 49:16.019
I was responsible
for the lion's share

49:16.055 --> 49:17.814
of taking care of the home.

49:18.377 --> 49:21.658
But when the women's movement
came alive and Marty appreciated

49:21.693 --> 49:24.736
the importance of the work
I was doing,

49:25.134 --> 49:29.433
then I became the person
whose career came first.

49:29.728 --> 49:31.392
What was she like as a mom?

49:31.428 --> 49:32.463
Exigent.

49:32.517 --> 49:33.841
What do you mean by that?

49:33.877 --> 49:38.549
"Do your homework, clean
your room, don't disappoint us."

49:41.838 --> 49:44.252
Helping a lot
with, uh, schoolwork,

49:44.616 --> 49:47.250
commenting, pulling out
the red pen.

49:47.963 --> 49:51.388
Our dear
daughter Jane, all smiles,

49:51.547 --> 49:53.744
volunteered to the press.

49:53.963 --> 49:58.439
She had grown up in a home
in which responsibility

49:58.797 --> 50:00.595
was equally divided.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.869
Her father did the
cooking, she explained,

50:04.041 --> 50:06.228
and her mother did the thinking.

50:09.056 --> 50:11.475
So is she really
such a horrible cook?

50:11.650 --> 50:12.919
- Yes.
- Oh yeah.

50:12.955 --> 50:14.947
To this day I still can't eat
swordfish...

50:15.603 --> 50:17.322
after what she did to it.

50:18.017 --> 50:20.250
It wasn't until I was 14
that I encountered

50:20.285 --> 50:21.533
a live vegetable.

50:22.564 --> 50:25.488
Ruth is no longer
permitted in the kitchen...

50:26.502 --> 50:29.994
...this by the demand of our
children, who have taste.

50:41.627 --> 50:44.330
This is a book that Tata,

50:45.150 --> 50:47.444
he collected letters about me

50:47.588 --> 50:48.924
for my 50th birthday.

50:49.283 --> 50:51.799
- Tata organized all this.
- It was his idea.

50:52.117 --> 50:54.584
Tata, my... her husband,
my grandfather,

50:54.619 --> 50:56.231
he was especially doting,

50:56.267 --> 50:59.456
so they almost had a bad cop,
good cop relationship,

50:59.491 --> 51:01.258
when it came to the grandkids.

51:01.634 --> 51:04.603
Tata was more often the good cop
I would say,

51:04.720 --> 51:07.664
uh, mostly because bubbe
was often buried in her work

51:07.699 --> 51:09.192
so if we
really wanted something,

51:09.228 --> 51:12.236
we felt like we could nag tata
more often for it.

51:13.237 --> 51:14.283
"Dear Ruth,"

51:14.533 --> 51:17.541
I have little doubt
that you are proud, rightly so,

51:17.955 --> 51:20.400
of all you have achieved
as a judge

51:20.447 --> 51:22.799
and as a spouse
and a parent as well.

51:22.845 --> 51:24.581
But I conceive no way
you can take

51:24.616 --> 51:28.452
"greater pride than I do.
Love, Tata."

51:28.487 --> 51:30.205
- Nice.
- Very nice.

51:31.861 --> 51:34.384
- Do you read these often?
- No, I never read them.

51:34.447 --> 51:36.593
You should, they are very nice,
if you ever need a boost

51:36.628 --> 51:38.150
of self-confidence.

51:38.994 --> 51:41.164
So much of the shape of America
is a work

51:41.199 --> 51:42.236
of the U.S. Supreme Court

51:42.272 --> 51:44.049
and so the makeup of that Court

51:44.158 --> 51:45.739
is one of the enduring legacies

51:45.775 --> 51:48.916
of a president who has an
opportunity to appoint justices.

51:49.002 --> 51:50.794
And tonight this new president

51:50.830 --> 51:53.380
has his first chance to make it
a Clinton Court.

51:53.416 --> 51:57.214
This president has a very clear idea
of what he wants in this justice.

51:58.080 --> 52:01.322
I really did want to put
Governor Cuomo on the Court,

52:01.939 --> 52:04.283
but he didn't want to do it
so I started looking around.

52:04.611 --> 52:08.330
He kept moving from his favorite
person of the week

52:08.377 --> 52:10.267
to the next favorite person
of the week

52:10.650 --> 52:13.553
and judge Ginsburg
was sort of old

52:13.589 --> 52:14.998
to be a nominee.

52:15.189 --> 52:17.463
She was in her early 60s.

52:17.963 --> 52:19.989
Most people, I think, thought

52:20.025 --> 52:22.049
she was out of the running
for that reason

52:22.408 --> 52:24.975
and Marty was just not gonna
accept that.

52:25.010 --> 52:27.525
We're talking about Ruth

52:27.806 --> 52:30.313
and we must remember
how shy she was.

52:30.908 --> 52:36.525
I can't think of anyone
less likely to toot her own horn

52:37.172 --> 52:38.330
than Ruth.

52:40.279 --> 52:43.611
So Marty had to play
the New York Philharmonic.

52:55.573 --> 52:57.255
No question about it,

52:57.291 --> 52:59.650
people who observed
at the time, said,

52:59.759 --> 53:01.595
"well, Ruth would
have been on a list,"

53:01.631 --> 53:04.361
"maybe she would be 22 or 23"

53:04.843 --> 53:07.299
but it was Marty who
made her number one.

53:09.455 --> 53:12.916
He had a little book of
people that he contacted.

53:13.351 --> 53:14.424
They were...

53:16.056 --> 53:19.094
He had lots of contacts
in the business community,

53:19.336 --> 53:21.667
lots of contacts in the legal
community,

53:21.703 --> 53:25.402
in the academic community,
among the women she had helped.

53:25.937 --> 53:30.190
And he... I don't even know
all the things he did.

53:30.226 --> 53:34.289
He was so in love with his wife
and so respected her

53:34.805 --> 53:37.347
as a real giant
in the legal profession,

53:37.382 --> 53:38.862
he felt it would be an outrage

53:38.898 --> 53:40.961
if she wasn't seriously
considered.

53:41.140 --> 53:43.854
And look, he wasn't the only one
that was campaigning

53:43.889 --> 53:45.488
for somebody to be on the Court.

53:45.765 --> 53:47.445
He had
some pretty stiff opposition...

53:48.344 --> 53:50.906
but it was her interview
that did it.

53:54.758 --> 53:56.917
We arranged for her to come
to the white house.

53:56.953 --> 53:58.672
I wanted to see how her mind
worked.

53:59.027 --> 54:00.793
So I engaged her
in this conversation.

54:01.273 --> 54:03.690
And all of a sudden, I wasn't
the president interviewing her

54:03.726 --> 54:06.237
for the Supreme Court anymore,
we were two people having

54:06.273 --> 54:08.912
an honest discussion
about what's the best way

54:09.305 --> 54:12.789
in the moment and for the future
to make law.

54:13.750 --> 54:17.469
Ruth Ginsburg,
as quiet and kind of withdrawn

54:17.883 --> 54:21.558
and almost timid as she can be,
she is a performer

54:22.187 --> 54:24.484
and she walked in that room
and he fell for her.

54:24.531 --> 54:27.063
Literally, within 15 minutes,
I decided

54:27.098 --> 54:28.464
I was going to name her.

54:32.797 --> 54:35.570
I'm proud to nominate
this path-breaking attorney,

54:35.726 --> 54:39.209
advocate, and judge to be
the 107th justice

54:39.680 --> 54:41.844
to the United States Supreme Court.

54:49.851 --> 54:53.320
When I was nominated
back in 1993,

54:53.359 --> 54:55.656
senator Biden chaired
the committee.

54:56.219 --> 54:59.663
The leading republican
member was Orrin Hatch.

55:00.305 --> 55:01.865
Do you have
any concerns right now?

55:01.900 --> 55:03.116
There are always concerns

55:03.152 --> 55:05.519
because these are very important
positions.

55:05.555 --> 55:08.195
And so there will be a lot
of questions asked.

55:13.297 --> 55:16.713
Day two of the Ruth Bader
Ginsburg confirmation hearings.

55:16.748 --> 55:18.526
Judge Ginsburg did something

55:18.562 --> 55:21.058
no recent High Court
nominee has done,

55:21.094 --> 55:24.242
spoke at length about her
support for abortion rights.

55:24.680 --> 55:28.953
It is essential
to women's equality with man...

55:30.070 --> 55:33.945
that her choice... that she be
the decision maker.

55:35.101 --> 55:38.578
This is something central
to a woman's...

55:39.336 --> 55:41.204
life, to her dignity.

55:41.859 --> 55:44.805
And when government controls
that decision for her,

55:45.336 --> 55:49.211
she is being treated as less
than a fully adult...

55:49.714 --> 55:51.601
human responsible for...

55:52.748 --> 55:54.549
her own choices.

55:55.117 --> 55:57.624
She was put on the Court
by a liberal president,

55:58.490 --> 56:01.234
uh, as a liberal justice.

56:02.039 --> 56:04.239
And that's the way this country
works.

56:04.687 --> 56:06.529
I disagree with you
on a number of things,

56:06.564 --> 56:08.665
and I am sure you disagree
with me.

56:08.700 --> 56:10.273
But that isn't the issue, is it?

56:10.422 --> 56:12.130
And frankly, I admire you.

56:12.656 --> 56:14.175
You've earned the right,

56:14.211 --> 56:16.531
in my opinion,
to be on the Supreme Court.

56:16.877 --> 56:18.750
She was confirmed 96-3.

56:18.890 --> 56:21.664
Now, you could argue that it was
not as partisan a time

56:21.700 --> 56:23.734
as it is now
but it was pretty partisan.

56:36.679 --> 56:38.714
Promising to defend
the Constitution,

56:38.805 --> 56:41.131
pioneering women's rights
advocate Ruth Bader Ginsburg

56:41.166 --> 56:43.099
has been sworn in as the second
woman,

56:43.134 --> 56:44.901
on the U.S. Supreme Court bench.

56:45.287 --> 56:48.055
I will well and faithfully
discharge.

56:48.273 --> 56:51.180
The duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

56:51.750 --> 56:55.612
The duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

56:55.953 --> 56:59.148
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

57:02.484 --> 57:04.711
It was extremely exciting

57:05.015 --> 57:08.101
because this powerful
little woman

57:08.211 --> 57:09.562
was going on the Supreme Court,

57:09.627 --> 57:12.328
and that meant there
were going to be two.

57:23.953 --> 57:27.180
The standard robe is made
for a man,

57:27.258 --> 57:31.681
because it has a place for the
shirt to show and the tie.

57:32.390 --> 57:36.190
So Sandra Day O'Connor and I,
thought it would be appropriate

57:36.226 --> 57:39.633
if we included as part
of our robe,

57:39.846 --> 57:42.469
something typical of a woman.

57:44.337 --> 57:46.180
During my long tenure here,

57:46.279 --> 57:48.367
I was not the most quote,

57:48.484 --> 57:50.238
liberal justice on the Court.

57:50.492 --> 57:53.219
From the beginning, I think
what she was looking for

57:53.404 --> 57:55.523
was to build consensus.

57:56.586 --> 57:58.597
Even though chief justice
Rehnquist

57:58.633 --> 58:01.558
and Sandra day O'Connor were
conservative justices.

58:01.594 --> 58:04.479
They were still justices
with which,

58:04.515 --> 58:06.633
Ginsburg was able to find
common ground.

58:07.452 --> 58:08.828
That was her style.

58:09.039 --> 58:12.489
She really wanted to be able
to convince her fellow justices

58:12.703 --> 58:14.789
to move her way even if it means

58:15.023 --> 58:17.680
conceding certain things
and compromising.

58:32.023 --> 58:33.367
To start out,

58:33.461 --> 58:36.890
I thought you might like
to know a little about the

58:37.226 --> 58:39.328
gentlemen who
are surrounding us.

58:40.156 --> 58:43.242
These are the first set
of chief justices

58:43.278 --> 58:44.742
of the Supreme Court.

58:45.711 --> 58:48.375
John Marshall is the
4th chief justice and

58:48.753 --> 58:50.011
what he said was,

58:50.261 --> 58:52.312
that this Constitution

58:52.896 --> 58:54.964
is the highest law of the land.

58:55.750 --> 58:57.203
The 14th amendment

58:57.680 --> 59:00.312
has a clause that you
all should know about

59:01.161 --> 59:04.039
and I'll read it to you.
It says...

59:06.210 --> 59:09.883
"And nor shall any state deny
to any person

59:10.640 --> 59:13.953
the equal protection
of the laws."

59:14.885 --> 59:17.265
So if Congress passes a law

59:17.570 --> 59:20.703
or the president issues
an executive order

59:20.937 --> 59:23.336
that is in conflict
with the Constitution,

59:24.094 --> 59:27.469
the Constitution must prevail.

59:48.265 --> 59:51.867
VMI was a 150 year old,

59:52.354 --> 59:54.812
all-male military college.

59:55.648 --> 59:59.562
It had a tremendous endowment,
well-connected alumni,

59:59.597 --> 01:00:01.237
four star generals.

01:00:01.273 --> 01:00:04.390
When you came out of VMI
that was something.

01:00:04.453 --> 01:00:06.465
Virginia military
institute was the last

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.409
all-male state supported school
in the country.

01:00:08.445 --> 01:00:12.805
157 years of school tradition as
an all-male military academy.

01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:18.425
Boys can be troublesome,
full of hormones and so forth,

01:00:18.461 --> 01:00:21.718
and I don't mean to make general
gender characteristics

01:00:21.815 --> 01:00:25.269
or generalizations here
but for some young men,

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.609
at that time of their life
they need discipline,

01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:31.128
they need hard work
and they need

01:00:31.164 --> 01:00:33.664
not a lot of extra time
to get into trouble.

01:00:33.898 --> 01:00:35.672
And VMI provided that.

01:00:35.711 --> 01:00:37.937
Look at the men
which stand before you!

01:00:37.992 --> 01:00:40.851
They represent the essence
of VMI!

01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:46.042
A female high school student
wanted to attend VMI.

01:00:46.078 --> 01:00:50.367
So she brought a case against
Virginia, claiming that

01:00:50.422 --> 01:00:53.273
the all-male admissions policy
violated equal protection.

01:00:54.286 --> 01:00:55.956
It actually went
from the District Court

01:00:55.992 --> 01:00:58.750
to the appellate Court before it
came up to the Supreme Court.

01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:03.914
This was an extremely important
case for justice Ginsburg.

01:01:04.163 --> 01:01:09.225
It was her first women's rights
case on the Supreme Court.

01:01:10.286 --> 01:01:12.300
The honorable chief justice

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:15.070
and the associate justices
of the Supreme Court

01:01:15.106 --> 01:01:16.839
of the United States.

01:01:17.442 --> 01:01:21.081
I was very much aware
of justice Ginsburg's history

01:01:21.117 --> 01:01:25.011
with respect to gender excluding
women from an institution.

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:28.394
I was very much aware of that
and I was trying to fashion

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:32.055
an argument that would penetrate
that.

01:02:06.047 --> 01:02:11.960
I was dealing with a very
worthy and formidable force

01:02:11.996 --> 01:02:14.130
at the other side of that bench.

01:02:27.258 --> 01:02:30.836
That was my pitch. As you know
it didn't work.

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.616
...to aspire, achieve,

01:03:07.086 --> 01:03:11.453
participate in, and contribute
to society...

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.524
based on what they can do.

01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:18.269
The for-men only
tradition of VMI became history

01:03:18.305 --> 01:03:21.578
with the arrival of women
entering as first year cadets.

01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:24.400
Cadre, take charge of your rats.

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:30.105
I was in
the first class of women.

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.351
We were here not to break
tradition not to ruin history

01:03:34.631 --> 01:03:36.336
but to help grow it.

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:44.519
For those four years I worked
extremely hard,

01:03:44.555 --> 01:03:46.389
to be the best person I could be

01:03:46.424 --> 01:03:48.359
and to represent women
as a whole.

01:03:48.672 --> 01:03:51.093
I wanted to be that person
that stood in front of the men

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:52.687
and said, "I can do it, too."

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:00.820
It's most
appropriate that we welcome today

01:04:00.856 --> 01:04:02.797
a member of our
nation's highest Court,

01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:04.469
a notable example

01:04:04.734 --> 01:04:08.242
of a citizen with a lifelong
dedication to public service,

01:04:08.515 --> 01:04:10.513
justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

01:04:10.572 --> 01:04:11.572
Thank you.

01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:14.517
Welcome to the
Virginia Military Institute.

01:04:14.922 --> 01:04:17.553
VMI fought very hard to keep
women out.

01:04:18.156 --> 01:04:21.394
I had an alumni walk up to me,
and he says,

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:23.220
"I'm not going to shake
your hand. I want to know"

01:04:23.255 --> 01:04:24.788
why you're here,

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.264
"um, and why you
decided to ruin my school."

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:31.570
I know that there were some
people who did not...

01:04:32.797 --> 01:04:37.206
react well to the change
and my response to this was,

01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:41.617
"wait and see, you will be proud
of the women

01:04:41.913 --> 01:04:45.250
who become graduates of VMI."

01:04:49.125 --> 01:04:52.862
It wasn't just about VMI,
it was about the notion

01:04:52.898 --> 01:04:57.933
that you cannot exclude women
just because they're women.

01:04:57.969 --> 01:04:59.703
You cannot say categorically,

01:05:00.177 --> 01:05:02.054
"they can't handle this."

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.834
It's way beyond VMI, way beyond.

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:08.838
And she pulled some
of the justices of that Court

01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:15.125
over to see that you start,
you start with an assumption

01:05:16.289 --> 01:05:19.719
that you have got to treat
both genders equally.

01:05:20.961 --> 01:05:24.933
That majority opinion,
was the culmination of Ruth's

01:05:24.969 --> 01:05:28.578
dedication to the concept
of equality for women.

01:05:30.722 --> 01:05:33.258
Those are current cadets.

01:05:36.219 --> 01:05:40.648
One wanted to be a nuclear
scientist, the others engineers.

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:44.523
All very well adjusted to life
at VMI.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.461
So, you can see...

01:05:54.578 --> 01:05:58.562
many varieties there are more up
on top.

01:05:59.258 --> 01:06:01.453
This is the latest one
I've gotten.

01:06:03.515 --> 01:06:04.985
So people just send them to you?

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.453
Yes.

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:10.156
What's in this one?

01:06:11.086 --> 01:06:15.404
Oh this one was given to me
by the University of Hawaii,

01:06:15.642 --> 01:06:17.078
with French lace...

01:06:17.911 --> 01:06:19.867
and the beads are
from the beach.

01:06:22.601 --> 01:06:27.055
It is a gift from law clerks,
a few terms back.

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:29.633
And this is what I use...

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:32.758
for announcing majority opinion.

01:06:33.402 --> 01:06:36.898
And this one is for dissenting
opinion.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:46.890
Every day before we sit
in the Court,

01:06:47.039 --> 01:06:49.508
the first thing we do is,
we go around the room

01:06:49.906 --> 01:06:52.992
each justice shaking hands
with every other.

01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:56.987
We know that collegiality
is very important

01:06:57.023 --> 01:06:59.382
to the effective working
of the Court.

01:07:00.219 --> 01:07:04.781
So we better respect each other
and even like each other.

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.009
She did something I'm not sure
I could have done,

01:07:07.044 --> 01:07:09.484
she made real friendship
with Scalia.

01:07:09.523 --> 01:07:13.240
They are the leading
voice of opposite points of views

01:07:13.276 --> 01:07:15.062
on the United States Supreme Court.

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:17.125
Why don't you call us,
the odd couple?

01:07:19.695 --> 01:07:22.906
He is a very funny fellow.

01:07:22.969 --> 01:07:24.386
She is a very nice person,

01:07:24.422 --> 01:07:26.711
she likes opera, what's not
to like?

01:07:28.328 --> 01:07:30.937
Except her views of law
of course.

01:07:33.336 --> 01:07:35.094
Justice Scalia believes

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:37.307
that one should read
the Constitution

01:07:37.343 --> 01:07:39.995
according to its plain language,

01:07:40.031 --> 01:07:44.026
according to the meanings
that were ascribed, uh,

01:07:44.062 --> 01:07:48.065
to those words when those words
were enacted.

01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:50.339
But you're saying is,
let's try to figure out

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:53.320
the mindset of people back
200 years ago, right?

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.444
Well, it isn't the mindset,

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.151
it's - it's, what - what
did the words mean

01:07:58.187 --> 01:08:00.245
to the people who ratified
the bill of rights

01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:01.777
or who ratified
the Constitution.

01:08:01.813 --> 01:08:03.940
As opposed to what people today
think it meant?

01:08:03.976 --> 01:08:06.548
As opposed to what people today
would like.

01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:08.461
I see the Constitution,

01:08:08.578 --> 01:08:11.562
as striving for
a more perfect union.

01:08:11.898 --> 01:08:15.124
Who were we the people in 1787?

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.995
You would not be among
we the people,

01:08:18.031 --> 01:08:21.063
African Americans would not be
among the people.

01:08:21.663 --> 01:08:24.144
She's this
supposed famous liberal,

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.144
he's this supposed famous
conservative.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.270
She's a Jewish, he's, uh,
catholic.

01:08:29.765 --> 01:08:33.430
She's retiring at times,
and he almost never is.

01:08:33.898 --> 01:08:38.136
And yet as with many great
friendships there's chemistry

01:08:38.171 --> 01:08:40.542
that maybe you can't
entirely explain.

01:08:40.578 --> 01:08:43.917
That's thing about Ruth
is that she can compartmentalize

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:46.889
better than I do. She is able
to have a close friend

01:08:46.924 --> 01:08:48.969
who had these outrageous views,

01:08:49.429 --> 01:08:50.176
um,

01:08:50.358 --> 01:08:53.063
about women and about gays
and lesbians.

01:08:53.573 --> 01:08:54.840
I have a little bit of trouble
with that.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:56.921
I don't have close friends
who are right wing

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:57.604
nutcases.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.558
Even though they had
differing points of view,

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:02.104
they were dear friends.
I'm sure they were...

01:09:02.508 --> 01:09:04.273
picking at each other
the whole time.

01:09:04.337 --> 01:09:06.225
But they kind of enjoyed it.

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:09.484
Justice scalia would
whisper something to me.

01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:12.956
All I could do to avoid
laughing out loud,

01:09:12.992 --> 01:09:15.283
so I would sometimes pinch
myself.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:16.776
People sometimes ask me,

01:09:16.812 --> 01:09:19.603
"well, what was your favorite
scalia joke?" And I said,

01:09:19.639 --> 01:09:21.633
"I know what it is,
but I can't tell you."

01:09:23.014 --> 01:09:24.919
They enjoyed going to the operas
together,

01:09:24.955 --> 01:09:27.750
and they enjoyed discussing
particular operas

01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:30.718
and of course, they appeared
together in an opera.

01:09:32.813 --> 01:09:35.484
What's the most fun
thing you've ever done together?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.038
Was it being on that elephant
together in India?

01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:40.758
That was a rather bumpy ride.

01:09:40.984 --> 01:09:44.578
Some of her feminist
friends gave her a hard time

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:47.747
because she rode behind me
on the elephant.

01:09:47.852 --> 01:09:50.062
- And that's wha...
- I'm not kidding.

01:09:50.117 --> 01:09:53.421
It-- it was... the driver
explained it was a matter

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:55.257
of distribution of weight.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.728
Washington has a reputation
as being a hard town

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:01.190
to make good friendships.

01:10:01.226 --> 01:10:04.140
And the Supreme Court itself
is a place where your colleagues

01:10:04.176 --> 01:10:06.578
on any given case are also
your adversaries.

01:10:06.914 --> 01:10:09.906
It was very gratifying to see
the two of them together

01:10:09.942 --> 01:10:11.806
and know that they had
their disagreements

01:10:11.851 --> 01:10:14.594
but that my father had this
just really wonderful friend.

01:10:16.883 --> 01:10:18.862
The presidential
election is over.

01:10:18.898 --> 01:10:22.492
George Bush prevails by one
vote in the Supreme Court.

01:10:23.812 --> 01:10:25.883
George, this effectively ends
the election.

01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:27.120
It has ended the election and Peter,

01:10:27.155 --> 01:10:30.031
literally one of the closest
elections in American history.

01:10:30.164 --> 01:10:33.542
600 votes approximately
separated Gore and bush

01:10:33.578 --> 01:10:35.894
in the state of Florida,
and now by one vote

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:38.133
on the Supreme Court,
this election is over.

01:10:38.765 --> 01:10:41.562
Look at the dissents and the
strong language in the dissents.

01:10:41.598 --> 01:10:43.722
Justice Ginsburg, "the
Court's conclusion"

01:10:43.758 --> 01:10:46.120
that a recount is impractical,
is a prophecy

01:10:46.156 --> 01:10:49.245
the Court's own judgment
will not allow to be tested.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.183
"Such an untested prophecy..."

01:10:51.219 --> 01:10:54.250
...should not decide
the presidency

01:10:54.518 --> 01:10:56.219
of the United States.

01:10:57.159 --> 01:10:58.328
I dissent.

01:11:00.698 --> 01:11:03.300
She was never supposed
to be the great dissenter

01:11:03.336 --> 01:11:06.383
but that's the course
that history took her on.

01:11:08.195 --> 01:11:12.167
George W. Bush was able
to appoint two justices.

01:11:12.859 --> 01:11:16.703
The addition of Samuel Alito
and John Roberts on the Court

01:11:17.074 --> 01:11:18.898
pushed it far to the right.

01:11:19.695 --> 01:11:24.179
The role of an individual
justice can change dramatically

01:11:24.215 --> 01:11:25.614
as the Court changes.

01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:28.751
With the departure
of justice O'Connor

01:11:29.328 --> 01:11:33.480
and with more conservatives
joining the bench.

01:11:33.516 --> 01:11:38.094
She found she had to really
exercise her dissenting voice.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.599
Of course I prefer to be
in the majority

01:11:43.634 --> 01:11:45.901
but if necessary...

01:11:46.461 --> 01:11:49.695
I will write separately
in dissent.

01:11:55.906 --> 01:11:57.569
Lilly Ledbetter:
I went to work one night

01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:59.484
and someone had left me a note.

01:11:59.672 --> 01:12:05.281
It had my name and three men.
We four had the exact same job.

01:12:05.873 --> 01:12:09.275
My pay was 40 percent less
than theirs.

01:12:09.508 --> 01:12:12.440
I had been shortchanged
for no other reason

01:12:12.476 --> 01:12:16.492
than I had been born
the wrong sex, I was a woman.

01:12:17.476 --> 01:12:20.383
The jury found that I had been
discriminated against

01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:21.993
but of course, Goodyear appealed

01:12:22.029 --> 01:12:23.305
and then we were notified

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.414
that we would be heard
in the Supreme Court.

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:30.344
I looked at the Court makeup,

01:12:30.531 --> 01:12:34.164
that's when justice Alito
had just gone on the bench.

01:12:34.328 --> 01:12:38.140
Justice Ginsburg at the time
was the only female left.

01:12:38.344 --> 01:12:40.402
Justice Alito read the opinion,

01:12:40.859 --> 01:12:41.776
he said,

01:12:41.812 --> 01:12:43.889
"I was definitely" discriminated

01:12:43.994 --> 01:12:47.593
against but I had not
filed my charge timely,

01:12:47.789 --> 01:12:50.780
"that I'd waited too late
to file my charge."

01:13:25.183 --> 01:13:28.619
She's hit the nail on the head
because she definitely said,

01:13:28.655 --> 01:13:31.807
"they do not know what it's like
in the real world."

01:13:32.436 --> 01:13:35.811
Today, the ball again lies
in Congress' Court...

01:13:36.483 --> 01:13:40.716
"...to correct the error into
which the Court has fallen."

01:13:41.092 --> 01:13:44.575
She was laying down a marker
for Congress and in fact

01:13:44.748 --> 01:13:47.482
federal law was changed
because of her dissent.

01:13:47.653 --> 01:13:50.747
Three fifths of the senators
having voted in the affirmative,

01:13:51.196 --> 01:13:52.575
the bill has passed.

01:13:57.551 --> 01:14:02.527
It is fitting that
the very first bill that I sign,

01:14:03.083 --> 01:14:07.727
the Lilly Ledbetter fair pay
restoration act is upholding

01:14:07.763 --> 01:14:10.591
one of this nation's
founding principles...

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.549
that we are all created equal...

01:14:13.903 --> 01:14:16.552
and each deserve a chance
to pursue

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.880
our own version of happiness.

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:31.667
Ruth and I were in New York City

01:14:31.702 --> 01:14:33.402
to see the play proof.

01:14:33.739 --> 01:14:37.208
And as we walked down the aisle
to our seats,

01:14:37.247 --> 01:14:41.716
what seemed like the entire
audience began to applaud,

01:14:42.012 --> 01:14:45.059
many stood, Ruth beamed.

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.951
I beamed too, leaned over

01:14:49.153 --> 01:14:51.434
and whispered loudly,

01:14:51.708 --> 01:14:56.192
"I bet you didn't know there's a
convention of tax lawyers in town."

01:14:58.138 --> 01:15:01.773
Well, without changing
her bright smile,

01:15:02.044 --> 01:15:04.700
Ruth smacked me right
in the stomach.

01:15:05.513 --> 01:15:09.583
I give you this picture
because it fairly captures

01:15:09.723 --> 01:15:13.273
our nearly
50-year happy marriage.

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:16.220
During which I've offered
up an astonishing

01:15:16.256 --> 01:15:18.438
number of foolish pronouncements

01:15:18.521 --> 01:15:21.179
and Ruth has
ignored almost every one.

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.320
Well, I think part of the time

01:15:29.356 --> 01:15:31.622
when he was sick,
she was in denial.

01:15:32.067 --> 01:15:34.700
He just became weaker
and weaker.

01:15:35.153 --> 01:15:37.513
The way people get
sick when they're...

01:15:37.983 --> 01:15:39.719
close to dying, but...

01:15:41.247 --> 01:15:46.028
she somehow knew how to turn off
those tear ducts in public.

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:48.684
She steeled herself for it.

01:15:50.346 --> 01:15:53.582
I found this letter...

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:56.669
next to Marty's bed
in the hospital.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.254
"My dearest Ruth,"

01:15:59.942 --> 01:16:03.325
you are the only person
I have loved in my life,

01:16:03.997 --> 01:16:07.817
setting aside a bit parents
and kids and their kids.

01:16:08.973 --> 01:16:12.234
What a treat it has been
to watch you progress

01:16:12.716 --> 01:16:15.020
to the very top
of the legal world.

01:16:16.466 --> 01:16:18.828
I have admired and loved you

01:16:18.864 --> 01:16:21.638
almost since the day we
first met at Cornell,

01:16:21.822 --> 01:16:23.968
some 56 years ago.

01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:29.544
The time has come for me
to take leave of life...

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:32.341
because the loss of quality...

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.872
now simply overwhelms.

01:16:37.481 --> 01:16:40.356
I hope you will support
where I come out...

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:43.927
and I understand you may not.

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:48.145
I will not love you...

01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:51.640
"a jot less."

01:16:54.802 --> 01:16:58.247
We met on a blind date in 1950.

01:16:58.458 --> 01:17:03.169
The truth is it was a blind
date only on Ruth's side.

01:17:05.356 --> 01:17:07.067
I cheated.

01:17:08.677 --> 01:17:13.169
I asked a classmate
to point her out in advance.

01:17:13.575 --> 01:17:17.666
"Oh, ho, she's really cute,"
I perceptively noticed.

01:17:18.309 --> 01:17:22.216
And then after a couple
of evenings out, I, uh, added,

01:17:22.252 --> 01:17:25.684
"and boy she's really,
really smart."

01:17:26.372 --> 01:17:30.677
In the intervening 53 years,
nothing changed.

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:40.329
Where are we headed?

01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:42.633
We're headed
to these outdoor sculptures,

01:17:42.677 --> 01:17:44.381
and all the sculptures are done
by contemporary

01:17:44.416 --> 01:17:45.583
native American artists.

01:17:46.411 --> 01:17:50.132
After a period
of very justified mourning,

01:17:50.403 --> 01:17:52.567
she sort of relaunched herself,

01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:54.755
into her work and
filled the time

01:17:54.791 --> 01:17:56.359
that she would have spent

01:17:56.395 --> 01:17:58.516
with my grandfather, with work

01:17:58.552 --> 01:18:00.031
both to distract herself I think

01:18:00.067 --> 01:18:02.844
from his absence but also
to honor him.

01:18:03.403 --> 01:18:07.315
This is her son, James,
and this is her grandson...

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:09.672
Marty was her life.

01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:12.421
And her children
and grandchildren who

01:18:12.456 --> 01:18:14.289
have a life of their own.

01:18:14.622 --> 01:18:16.658
She's very much interested
in arts

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:18.677
and loves to go to those things.

01:18:18.934 --> 01:18:21.716
And then she goes home
at the end of the evening

01:18:21.824 --> 01:18:23.524
and works until four
in the morning.

01:18:23.747 --> 01:18:27.403
These two pieces
are by a creek artist.

01:18:27.481 --> 01:18:29.591
And what is she called,
that one?

01:18:29.665 --> 01:18:31.001
She's called a woman warrior.

01:18:31.036 --> 01:18:34.591
Any kind of battle you bring
to her, she's ready for it.

01:18:38.419 --> 01:18:41.031
It's considered one of the most
important pieces

01:18:41.067 --> 01:18:43.731
of civil rights legislation
ever passed,

01:18:43.778 --> 01:18:46.555
but by 5-4 the
U.S. Supreme Court today,

01:18:46.591 --> 01:18:49.898
took the teeth out of a law
enacted nearly 50 years ago.

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:53.255
Voting rights act has
policed voting discrimination

01:18:53.302 --> 01:18:56.434
but today's decision
effectively puts it on hold.

01:18:56.567 --> 01:18:58.227
Chief justice, John Roberts,

01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:01.536
summarized his opinion
with four telling words,

01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:04.106
"our country has changed."

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:15.809
"...is like throwing away
your umbrella..."

01:19:16.622 --> 01:19:18.056
"in a rainstorm..."

01:19:18.497 --> 01:19:20.528
"because you are not getting
wet."

01:19:20.934 --> 01:19:25.645
She called out the majority
and said this makes zero sense.

01:19:26.028 --> 01:19:30.427
The entire reason that racial
discrimination in voting

01:19:30.825 --> 01:19:35.367
is not happening is because
we have this very important law.

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:39.239
I was righteously angry
right alongside with her.

01:19:39.395 --> 01:19:43.036
Her dissent was the introduction
for many young people

01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:45.927
about how important the Court is
to our everyday lives.

01:19:46.223 --> 01:19:48.183
I just pulled up Photoshop
and did the design

01:19:48.218 --> 01:19:49.356
in like 15 minutes.

01:19:49.411 --> 01:19:51.062
I came up with a couple slogans

01:19:51.098 --> 01:19:53.161
but the one that kept coming
back to me was,

01:19:53.204 --> 01:19:56.071
"you can't spell truth
without Ruth."

01:19:57.116 --> 01:19:59.344
A friend of mine
posted on Facebook saying,

01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:01.364
"Wow! Justice Ginsburg,
sure can write"

01:20:01.407 --> 01:20:02.797
# NotoriousRBG

01:20:03.388 --> 01:20:07.035
So I started a Tumblr
and I called it Notorious RBG.

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.825
She is known to fans
the world over as,

01:20:09.861 --> 01:20:12.106
the Notorious RBG.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.473
Yeah...♪ <i>This album is
dedicated to all the teachers</i>

01:20:16.509 --> 01:20:18.552
<i>that told me I'd never amount
to nothing.</i>

01:20:18.622 --> 01:20:22.851
I do know where
the Notorious RBG came from.

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:28.252
It... it was the rapper
the Notorious B.I.G.

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:38.270
People ask me, "don't you feel
uncomfortable being"

01:20:38.847 --> 01:20:42.231
with a name
like notorious B.I.G?"

01:20:43.206 --> 01:20:46.200
Um... why should I feel
uncomfortable?

01:20:46.661 --> 01:20:48.536
We have a lot in common.

01:20:54.098 --> 01:20:55.785
First and foremost...

01:20:56.228 --> 01:20:59.309
we were both born and bred
in Brooklyn, New York.

01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:03.425
Young people are really craving

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:04.793
different kinds of icons.

01:21:05.153 --> 01:21:07.095
Realizing that somebody like RBG

01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:09.950
has been doing her job
for decades

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:12.801
and being forceful
and speaking truth to power

01:21:12.836 --> 01:21:14.436
kind of blows my mind.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.538
A big win for conservatives

01:21:16.573 --> 01:21:18.388
in the hobby lobby case.

01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:26.754
Justice Ginsburg
has filed a dissenting opinion.

01:21:38.475 --> 01:21:42.234
We were all so hungry to hear
from Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:44.199
Every time justice Ginsburg
wrote a dissent,

01:21:44.234 --> 01:21:45.461
the Internet would explode.

01:21:45.497 --> 01:21:47.766
Justice Ginsburg
has filed a dissenting opinion.

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:50.242
Justice Ginsburg has
filed a dissenting opinion.

01:21:50.278 --> 01:21:52.239
My dissenting opinion.
I dissent.

01:21:52.275 --> 01:21:54.180
Dissent from today's decision.

01:21:54.216 --> 01:21:56.510
You just had to put
the words Ruth Bader Ginsburg

01:21:56.546 --> 01:22:00.005
into something and it would be
shared compulsively.

01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:17.799
She's become such
a rock star and she enjoys it.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.329
To see

01:22:19.365 --> 01:22:22.013
people wear
Notorious RBG t-shirts

01:22:22.049 --> 01:22:25.288
or other paraphernalia
with her face on it.

01:22:25.475 --> 01:22:27.133
It's weird honestly.

01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:29.310
She gives her RBG t-shirts
to people.

01:22:29.513 --> 01:22:31.313
She called and laughed
did you get the birthday gift?

01:22:31.348 --> 01:22:33.448
I said I did I'm wearing it.

01:22:33.483 --> 01:22:35.802
- Tattoos! Yeah.
- Lots of tattoos.

01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:38.253
I had a picture
of one of the tattoos

01:22:38.294 --> 01:22:41.091
and I showed it to her
and she goes "uh!"

01:22:41.383 --> 01:22:43.591
Why would you do something
so permanent?"

01:22:45.209 --> 01:22:47.740
Here now to comment
is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

01:22:50.953 --> 01:22:52.587
Alright! Justice coming in hot.

01:22:52.623 --> 01:22:55.804
I'm ready to rumble
Mayweather, Pacquiao style.

01:22:56.115 --> 01:22:58.707
I float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee,

01:22:58.742 --> 01:23:00.779
I clean myself like a fly.

01:23:03.546 --> 01:23:04.797
It's so unlike mom,

01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:07.949
but I don't think mom...
an accurate imitation of mom

01:23:07.984 --> 01:23:09.724
would be that funny.

01:23:09.896 --> 01:23:11.857
Do you think she watches them?

01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:13.388
I don't think she ever has
watched television.

01:23:13.423 --> 01:23:15.090
Yeah, I'm not sure she knows
how to turn on...

01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:17.435
No, no, she watches the NewsHour
while she's working out.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.995
Yeah, but that's at the Court,
does she know how to turn on

01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:22.107
- the television at home?
- I don't think so.

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:27.068
Here to explain is Supreme Court
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

01:23:27.103 --> 01:23:28.803
Is this' Saturday Night Live'?

01:23:29.599 --> 01:23:34.042
I like my men like I like
my decisions: 5-4.

01:23:34.077 --> 01:23:36.711
That's a third-degree Gins-burn!!

01:23:47.295 --> 01:23:49.826
It's marvelously funny.
How did they...

01:23:50.466 --> 01:23:51.912
Remind you of yourself?

01:23:52.677 --> 01:23:54.146
Not one bit.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.367
Except for the collar.

01:23:59.849 --> 01:24:01.102
What about the state
of the union

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:02.607
where you were caught sleeping?

01:24:02.654 --> 01:24:04.739
No, I wasn't sleeping
I was just giving in

01:24:04.774 --> 01:24:06.716
to the weight of my glasses.

01:24:11.315 --> 01:24:12.650
Watching the state of the union

01:24:12.685 --> 01:24:15.758
and I notice that her head
is drooping a little bit

01:24:15.794 --> 01:24:19.646
and she might have dozed off
for about a minute or two.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.790
After that happened,
I called her up and said,

01:24:22.246 --> 01:24:24.241
"you know, bubbe, you were asleep
during the state of the union,

01:24:24.276 --> 01:24:25.204
you can't do that."

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:26.920
You went to
the state of the union

01:24:26.955 --> 01:24:28.187
and you fell asleep.

01:24:29.858 --> 01:24:31.599
As I often do.

01:24:32.099 --> 01:24:34.243
The audience for the most part
is awake,

01:24:34.279 --> 01:24:37.446
because they're bobbing up
and down all the time...

01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:40.723
and we sit there, stone faced...

01:24:41.044 --> 01:24:43.211
sober judges. But we're not...

01:24:43.638 --> 01:24:46.443
at least I wasn't,
a hundred percent sober.

01:24:49.263 --> 01:24:53.021
She does look vulnerable,
she is this tiny little person

01:24:53.107 --> 01:24:55.190
and that is somehow in contrast
with being

01:24:55.225 --> 01:25:01.248
the ferocious defender
of minorities and women and...

01:25:02.064 --> 01:25:03.780
certain kinds of ideals.

01:25:03.816 --> 01:25:05.833
There's always I think
the concern that can she

01:25:05.873 --> 01:25:07.779
continue to keep up this pace?

01:25:07.815 --> 01:25:10.671
Well, she's now been through

01:25:10.707 --> 01:25:12.419
two different types of cancer

01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:14.341
without missing a day
on the bench.

01:25:14.826 --> 01:25:19.514
I had my first cancer
bout in 1999,

01:25:19.549 --> 01:25:21.249
Colorectal cancer.

01:25:21.654 --> 01:25:24.552
It was the year of first surgery

01:25:24.587 --> 01:25:26.888
and then chemotherapy.

01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:30.302
Ten years later,
I had pancreatic cancer.

01:25:31.005 --> 01:25:33.828
I think what it has left me
is...

01:25:34.388 --> 01:25:38.767
an enhanced appreciation
of the joys of being alive.

01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:41.837
What I need you to do
is just grab them and just pull.

01:25:42.154 --> 01:25:44.852
- Just standing up straight?
- Just pull, don't lean back.

01:25:44.888 --> 01:25:49.248
Good, just pull, pull, okay?
Arch that back. Good.

01:25:50.716 --> 01:25:52.927
- This is light.
- I know, I know,

01:25:53.449 --> 01:25:54.716
I got a heavier one.

01:25:54.912 --> 01:25:56.985
Since it's too light,
I got a heavier one

01:25:57.607 --> 01:26:00.818
I started training
justice Ginsburg back in 1999.

01:26:01.162 --> 01:26:03.212
She had just come out
of chemotherapy

01:26:03.248 --> 01:26:06.732
and she wanted to build muscle
and get stronger.

01:26:07.747 --> 01:26:08.880
She's like a cyborg.

01:26:08.994 --> 01:26:11.594
And when I say cyborg,
she's like a machine.

01:26:20.849 --> 01:26:24.060
Lean back. Good, yeah,
and pull yourself up.

01:26:24.514 --> 01:26:26.281
Exactly. Good.

01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:32.987
Alright, bring chest down
to the ball, good.

01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:35.757
They're real push-ups right,
they're not girl push-ups.

01:26:35.854 --> 01:26:39.481
No, th... they are...
very real, yes.

01:26:40.724 --> 01:26:43.231
I've heard
that she's does 20 push-ups,

01:26:43.266 --> 01:26:44.533
three times a week or something.

01:26:44.568 --> 01:26:46.281
I mean we can't even
get off the floor.

01:26:46.317 --> 01:26:47.900
We can't even get
down to the floor.

01:26:49.602 --> 01:26:51.140
That's true.

01:26:51.693 --> 01:26:55.443
I always feel better
no matter how tired I am,

01:26:55.931 --> 01:26:59.123
at the end of that hour,
I'm ready to go again.

01:27:02.185 --> 01:27:06.208
She definitely embodies
the larger than life nature

01:27:06.256 --> 01:27:09.390
of the "notorious" title...

01:27:09.691 --> 01:27:10.892
more and more as she gets older.

01:27:10.927 --> 01:27:13.774
She's become much more public,
much more vocal.

01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:15.496
Especially in a time
when our politics

01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:17.474
are just so garbage.

01:27:17.724 --> 01:27:20.168
Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg spoke fearfully

01:27:20.203 --> 01:27:21.787
of a Donald Trump presidency.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.704
An unusually candid
political outpouring

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.423
calling Trump a "faker."

01:27:26.459 --> 01:27:28.158
Justice Ginsburg, uh,

01:27:28.194 --> 01:27:30.575
made some very,
very inappropriate...

01:27:30.611 --> 01:27:31.974
statements toward me.

01:27:32.015 --> 01:27:33.466
I was flabbergasted.

01:27:33.662 --> 01:27:37.286
It surprised me that she would
comment in a derogatory way

01:27:37.322 --> 01:27:40.896
about any candidate
for president. It's...

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:44.692
it's inappropriate.

01:27:44.728 --> 01:27:46.828
It's not just a matter
of decorum...

01:27:47.005 --> 01:27:49.931
it's a matter of her
not understanding

01:27:49.966 --> 01:27:51.297
her Constitutional role.

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:54.282
She has just come out and issued
an apology.

01:27:54.318 --> 01:27:57.305
You released a statement
that read, "judges should avoid"

01:27:57.341 --> 01:27:59.990
commenting on a candidate
for public office."

01:28:00.248 --> 01:28:03.645
But do you really regret
the substance of what you said?

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.271
I think in the best,

01:28:05.318 --> 01:28:08.185
the wisest course would have
been to say nothing.

01:28:08.482 --> 01:28:11.586
Is it wrong
for Supreme Court justices to...

01:28:12.052 --> 01:28:14.722
uh, to occasionally make
a mistake? No.

01:28:14.757 --> 01:28:16.060
They're human beings

01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:18.407
and she's a human being
and she apologized for it.

01:28:18.443 --> 01:28:22.857
It is quite possible that many,
many executive orders

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:27.029
or other things that a president
has supported or done

01:28:27.107 --> 01:28:29.399
are going to come before
the Supreme Court

01:28:29.435 --> 01:28:33.044
and that now we have a sitting
justice indicating,

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:35.777
that the person
has a deep antipathy,

01:28:35.812 --> 01:28:38.479
uh, against the lawmaker.

01:28:38.514 --> 01:28:39.781
The notion that I...

01:28:40.044 --> 01:28:42.750
I don't comprehend that my job...

01:28:43.107 --> 01:28:46.076
is to interpret the law fairly...

01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:49.935
that I'm going to vote
one way...

01:28:50.809 --> 01:28:54.185
based on who I might have voted
for president is just...

01:28:57.264 --> 01:28:58.779
none of us...

01:28:59.958 --> 01:29:01.585
even if we wanted to...

01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:05.216
could be successful if that's
the attitude that we had.

01:29:18.951 --> 01:29:20.922
You look marvelous.

01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:24.404
Knowing that we were opening on
the Saturday after the election,

01:29:24.646 --> 01:29:27.943
I wanted somebody who was
a Washington insider

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:30.832
to play the
'Duchess of Krakenthorp'.

01:29:31.037 --> 01:29:34.037
"The best of the
house of Krakenthorp..."

01:29:34.216 --> 01:29:38.612
There are very few operas
that have speaking parts

01:29:39.042 --> 01:29:42.076
and the Duchess of Krackenthorp

01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:45.357
is one such part. So I wrote...

01:29:46.105 --> 01:29:49.581
basically my own lines for
the Duchess of Krackenthorp.

01:29:59.214 --> 01:30:02.526
"The best of the house
of Krakenthorp"

01:30:03.029 --> 01:30:06.698
have open, but not empty minds.

01:30:07.175 --> 01:30:08.908
No surprise then

01:30:09.456 --> 01:30:13.241
that the most valorous
krakenthorpians

01:30:13.276 --> 01:30:14.691
"have been women!"

01:30:18.745 --> 01:30:21.093
"A lady Krackenthorp"

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:25.319
at all times must conduct herself

01:30:25.354 --> 01:30:28.189
with dignity and grace.

01:30:28.667 --> 01:30:32.620
We now request certain
essential documents.

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:36.761
"Have you brought your niece's
birth certificate?"

01:30:46.757 --> 01:30:50.300
"Ours is a family
wildly trumpeted,"

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:54.218
hence we must take
precautions against

01:30:54.801 --> 01:30:56.409
"fraudulent pretenders."

01:31:13.472 --> 01:31:16.838
Justice Ginsburg, I think everyone
expected you to retire soon.

01:31:16.874 --> 01:31:17.948
I mean, you're 83.

01:31:18.003 --> 01:31:21.058
Yeah, you're damn right.
I was gonna retire. Ugh!

01:31:21.283 --> 01:31:22.428
But not now.

01:31:22.464 --> 01:31:24.745
Not now, now I gotta stay
alive and healthy.

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:26.647
Damn it. Give me my thing.

01:31:27.026 --> 01:31:29.167
Excuse me, I gotta take
my vitamins.

01:31:30.143 --> 01:31:32.570
Oh my god, that's...

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:35.909
...That's...
that's a packet.

01:31:42.438 --> 01:31:45.741
Justice Ginsburg,
let me ask you a tough question.

01:31:45.878 --> 01:31:50.550
There were liberals who publicly
urged you to retire, uh...

01:31:51.473 --> 01:31:52.733
two or three years ago,

01:31:52.769 --> 01:31:55.909
so that president Obama
could name a replacement.

01:31:56.776 --> 01:31:59.245
Any second thoughts
about not doing that?

01:32:01.769 --> 01:32:04.237
I have said many times
that I will...

01:32:05.042 --> 01:32:06.342
do this job...

01:32:06.774 --> 01:32:10.690
as long as I can do it
full steam.

01:32:11.364 --> 01:32:13.466
And when I can't...

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.058
that will be the time,

01:32:16.639 --> 01:32:18.373
I will step down.

01:32:20.691 --> 01:32:23.691
She has found her voice
on the Court.

01:32:24.207 --> 01:32:26.175
She is a center of power...

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:29.284
on the Court and off the Court.

01:32:29.394 --> 01:32:31.295
When the history books are written,

01:32:31.331 --> 01:32:32.980
an enormous amount will be about

01:32:33.015 --> 01:32:36.167
what she did as a very young lawyer.

01:32:36.581 --> 01:32:39.537
There would not
have been the legal status

01:32:39.573 --> 01:32:42.730
of women today had it not been
for her work in the '70s.

01:32:42.932 --> 01:32:45.420
She changed everything.

01:32:45.456 --> 01:32:49.401
The gender line helps
to keep women not on a pedestal

01:32:49.944 --> 01:32:51.110
but in a cage

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:55.436
Ruth's work made me feel
as if I was protected

01:32:55.472 --> 01:32:58.230
by the U.S. Constitution
for the first time.

01:32:58.441 --> 01:33:00.841
Men and women are persons
of equal dignity

01:33:00.876 --> 01:33:03.941
and they should count equally
before the law.

01:33:04.034 --> 01:33:07.782
She may be small but she's got
a firm backbone.

01:33:08.269 --> 01:33:10.326
It's been a long road for her

01:33:10.362 --> 01:33:13.542
and she's fought really hard
all the way down it.

01:33:13.923 --> 01:33:15.489
She's not done fighting.

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.559
Looking back over my long life.

01:33:19.128 --> 01:33:21.948
Yes, we may be in trying times...

01:33:23.231 --> 01:33:25.332
but think how it was.

01:33:25.714 --> 01:33:27.849
When I went to college...

01:33:28.151 --> 01:33:31.439
there was a big red scare
in our country.

01:33:32.042 --> 01:33:35.462
Some people in our Congress saw
a communist in every closet

01:33:35.498 --> 01:33:37.322
and in every corner.

01:33:37.566 --> 01:33:40.348
But it impressed me, that there
were lawyers reminding our Congress

01:33:40.383 --> 01:33:43.276
that we have freedom of speech
and of the press.

01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:47.194
So I thought that that was a
pretty good thing to do...

01:33:49.731 --> 01:33:52.237
To help keep our country in tune

01:33:52.273 --> 01:33:56.300
with its most basic values.

01:33:58.683 --> 01:34:01.275
Now is the busiest season
for the Court.

01:34:01.311 --> 01:34:04.894
All dissenting opinions
have to be...

01:34:05.823 --> 01:34:07.191
circulated.

01:34:07.636 --> 01:34:11.245
And I have a few of those
still to go.

01:34:11.995 --> 01:34:15.916
One of the world's greatest
jurists, judge learned hand...

01:34:16.386 --> 01:34:19.304
said, that the spirit of Liberty

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:23.925
that imbues our Constitution
must lie first and foremost
