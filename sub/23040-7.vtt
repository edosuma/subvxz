WEBVTT

00:07.400 --> 00:10.760
Girls, lay her down here. Be careful.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.200
-What happened?
-If you want to help, get more towels.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.400
Miguel, please. More towels.

00:20.840 --> 00:23.920
People think that seizing an opportunity
is like catching a train.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.080
The train only comes around once...

00:26.280 --> 00:28.720
and whether you catch it
depends on your luck.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.680
I'm sorry.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.040
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but...

00:37.880 --> 00:40.840
I was so scared, I didn't dare.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.480
You don't have to explain.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.920
We are your friends.
We don't need anything else.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.040
Thank you.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.040
Really.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.920
We are in this together...

00:57.880 --> 00:59.560
whatever happens.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.840
I, however, believe that
opportunities are all around us,

01:02.920 --> 01:07.560
and that real luck is knowing how
to spot them and not let them slip away.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.080
You're home now.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.680
Let's go.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.680
Just rest.

01:35.880 --> 01:39.000
-Good morning, Cuevas.
-Good morning.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.080
What is all this?

01:40.160 --> 01:43.440
I called you because I want you to see
something important. Follow me.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.480
CORONER'S OFFICE

01:59.160 --> 02:00.680
Looks like Mario Pérez.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.520
-When was he found?
-A few hours ago.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.640
I'd say he's been in there for weeks.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.960
-First, you have to inform--
-Inform his wife, yes.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.560
I'll stop by her workplace.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.560
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

03:14.760 --> 03:16.200
Good morning.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.640
Good morning.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.880
A lot of girls would kill
for an opportunity like this.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.680
CHAPTER 15: OPPORTUNITIES

03:53.760 --> 03:57.680
Who would have guessed that
we would finally understand each other?

03:58.400 --> 04:00.040
It was you who declared war on me.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.360
Let's leave the bad memories behind.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.840
Before I keep my part of the deal,

04:06.360 --> 04:08.200
I want you to sign this.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.959
This is a medical consent form.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.120
Obviously, I want to make sure
that you'll get rid of the child

04:21.200 --> 04:24.680
if I'm going to give you
this amount of money.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.520
But this isn't what we discussed.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.560
He's a very competent doctor. Don't worry.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.880
It's for your own good.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.240
I don't want you to fall into the hands
of a seedy butcher.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.160
I'll give you half now,

04:39.640 --> 04:43.080
and the other half
when the problem is solved.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.160
In that case, I want twice as much money.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.440
Money has never been a problem.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.320
Sign.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.320
When all this is over, we'll drink to us.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.200
Who knows? Maybe one day,
we'll do great things together.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.080
Who knows?

05:13.160 --> 05:14.440
Have a nice day.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.200
Lidia! How did it go?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.200
This afternoon, we'll fix the problem.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.040
I'll tell Marga and Carlota
to cover for us...

05:35.800 --> 05:37.040
No, they must not know.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.720
I'm taking a big risk conning Doña Carmen.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.800
-I know that, Lidia, I do.
-That's why.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.200
The fewer people involved, the better.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.120
Of course.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.720
One more thing.

05:50.960 --> 05:55.160
What are you going to do when people
start noticing you're pregnant?

05:59.400 --> 06:00.800
-I don't know.
-No?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.440
We have the money
and we know where the witness lives.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.920
-That's what matters now.
-Of course.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.280
One step at a time.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.520
One step at a time.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.080
I'm sick of that witch.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.160
She left this in my locker.
Lidia, this was Mario's.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.240
I'm sure it was her.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.840
Like she did with the lighter,
with the message on the mirror.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.080
-She wants to drive me crazy.
-Don't worry about her now.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.920
We have more important things to do.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.480
Come on.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.480
Ladies.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.200
Excuse me.
Inspector Cuevas has some important news.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.480
I need to speak to you
about an urgent matter, alone.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.000
Can we speak in front of Lidia?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.560
She's my friend. She's trustworthy.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.800
-Very well.
-What is it?

07:05.640 --> 07:09.120
Mrs. Vidal, we have found a body
that matches your husband's description.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.120
What?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.920
I know it's a delicate matter, but...

07:15.000 --> 07:17.560
I need you to come to the morgue
to identify the body.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.120
-Where was he found?
-In the river.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.600
The current carried him to the riverbank
after the storm.

07:22.680 --> 07:26.720
There, there. It's going to be all right.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.280
Can I go with her?

07:28.360 --> 07:30.080
-Of course.
-Thank you.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.800
I'll drive you there myself.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.120
Thank you for everything.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.880
Everything will be all right.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.400
Lidia.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.600
I'll be here for whatever you need.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.160
We can take all the time you need.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.800
I'm fine.
The sooner we finish this, the better.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
Very well.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.960
Gentlemen, proceed.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.320
Ángeles.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.200
Are you all right?

08:35.919 --> 08:39.360
I want you to find the bastards
who did this to my husband.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.840
I'll do that.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.240
-Are there any suspects?
-At the moment, nothing official.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.760
Excuse me.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.720
You face suddenly seems very familiar,
as if we've met before.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.520
Yes, at Ángeles' house,
when you came to...

09:02.200 --> 09:04.040
Yes, that must be it.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.440
Ángeles, can we have a word in my office?

09:13.640 --> 09:14.520
Don't say anything.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.480
Stay calm.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.680
This way.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.480
Sit down, please.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.120
How are you?
If I can do anything to help you...

09:38.280 --> 09:40.800
I don't know how this could have happened.

09:41.880 --> 09:46.120
Even today, I was receiving signs
that he was still alive,

09:46.840 --> 09:50.800
as if... he'd come back.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.800
Excuse me a moment.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.840
CASE REPORT

10:18.040 --> 10:20.960
Thursday the 11th,
visit to suspect's house.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.560
I leave the lighter on the table.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.720
Friday the 12th, call from Bilbao.

10:28.240 --> 10:32.280
Tuesday the 16th,
I write a message on a hand mirror.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.440
I put it in the locker.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.800
IT WAS YOU.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.280
You shouldn't have opened that file.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.280
It was you.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.960
Sometimes, in an investigation,
we have to do things we are not proud of.

11:00.040 --> 11:00.920
Ángeles...

11:02.320 --> 11:05.080
You tried to make me believe
that Mario was alive to see...

11:07.200 --> 11:10.960
to see if I was behind all this. My God!

11:11.040 --> 11:14.600
Let me explain.
Let me explain how it all happened.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.560
Is that why you slept with me?

11:18.880 --> 11:21.800
-No.
-To get information?

11:23.520 --> 11:24.840
My God!

11:26.360 --> 11:27.440
Ángeles, please...

11:30.360 --> 11:32.680
I thought you were different.

11:39.080 --> 11:42.040
What are you looking at?
Don't you have work to do?

11:42.680 --> 11:43.960
What happened?

11:44.800 --> 11:48.200
It seems I was not the only one seducing
someone to get information.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.720
We can't waste any more time.
We have to see the witness.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.200
Yes, please.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.120
Thank you.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.440
Nurse, hello. I'm Adeleida Carrascosa.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.640
I'm a former patient of Dr. Longoria.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.520
I wanted to send him a gift
to thank him for his treatment.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.920
But I don't have his address.
Could you give it to me?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.280
Thank you.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.360
Yes, go ahead.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.120
16 Puente Bajo Street, apartment 3A.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.400
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.360
Pablo, how did it go?

12:31.440 --> 12:33.480
-How are you?
-He's pretty good.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.920
How lucky that your operation
was moved up.

12:36.000 --> 12:36.960
-Keep your distance!
-Right.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.480
Both he and I need to rest for a few days,
so keep your distance.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.960
And then I'll be all ready
to do my part on our wedding night.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.160
Good, now listen.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.400
Since the meal will be at the lake,
next to the church,

12:49.480 --> 12:52.840
I thought we could find
a little hotel to... you know.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.960
Marga, distance, distance.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.920
It sounds great,
but now we have to focus on Don Fermín.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.640
-Yes.
-Doña Lola has done a lot to help us.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.120
We have to make
a good impression on the priest.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.960
Yes, you're right.

13:05.040 --> 13:08.760
What if we invite him for dinner after
the presentation of the phone booths?

13:08.840 --> 13:11.000
Doña Lola could make some nice soup.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.720
I think the dinner idea is good,
but soup isn't very much, is it?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.760
Are you taking over Doña Lola's kitchen?

13:16.840 --> 13:19.840
I don't want to take over
anything of Doña Lola's,

13:19.920 --> 13:22.840
but, with a priest,
either you fill him with food and wine,

13:22.920 --> 13:25.120
-or you don't get anything.
-Right.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.040
You can take care of the wine
and calling Don Fermín.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.720
Distance, please.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.720
-Tomorrow at 10:00.
-Yes.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.480
-What do you want?
-Forgive me...

13:43.880 --> 13:47.040
but I promised the boy
we'd come here if he got good grades.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.440
And he got "excellent" in religion.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.720
-Isn't that so, darling?
-Yes.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.440
Can I order something for you?
Chamomile tea or...

13:55.880 --> 13:57.760
An herbal brandy, please.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Father, I asked you to come because
I find myself in a delicate situation.

14:04.600 --> 14:08.120
-Look at him.
-A good bath will fix that.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.640
No, I didn't mean that.
I meant the child's father.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.680
What father?

14:11.760 --> 14:14.280
It's best if he explains it to you.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.640
Listen, Alvarito, my child,

14:17.720 --> 14:20.520
can you tell Father Fermín
who your father is?

14:20.600 --> 14:23.880
Pablo Santos Villanueva. 26 years.
Born in Valladolid.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.960
Yes, that's enough, darling.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.200
Pablo Santos? But that young man...
Leave the bottle.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.960
Yes, that same man.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.880
He wants to marry another woman
in your church.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.200
That's right.

14:35.280 --> 14:39.120
Six years ago, we got married
in a little town in Valladolid.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.880
Just as the child was born, he...

14:42.440 --> 14:44.240
My poor little angel.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.280
That scoundrel with a dumb face!

14:48.360 --> 14:51.680
That's his trick, father.
That's how he deceived me.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.000
He intends to do the same with you
and everyone who attends this wedding.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.360
I'm calling the church right now!

14:57.440 --> 14:59.440
That scoundrel will get what he deserves!

14:59.520 --> 15:02.520
Take this, Father.
Our marriage certificate.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
That lowlife will likely deny everything.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.680
A liar is caught sooner than a cripple.

15:11.480 --> 15:15.120
Honey, when the priest comes back,
can you act with a little more feeling?

15:15.200 --> 15:18.320
-You act like you don't have a mother.
-That'll be two more churros, doll.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.880
What do you...

15:21.080 --> 15:24.640
Waiter, two more churros for the child.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.920
-Did you check the switchboard connection?
-Miguel was supposed to do that.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.320
-And where's Miguel?
-He hasn't come in.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.680
What do you mean?
He hasn't come in at all today?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.520
Who is taking care of the adjustments?

15:37.600 --> 15:40.520
Good morning, Don Carlos.
How can I help you?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.280
Where have you been? You look dreadful.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.840
I was thinking about the prototype.
A couple of things don't add up.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.800
What things?

15:48.440 --> 15:51.280
Nothing important.
Nothing that can't be fixed.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.480
-I'll get a coffee and start working.
-No, I'll make sure you get coffee.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.640
The presentation is tomorrow.
You have to start right now.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.120
Very well.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.880
I'm sorry, but I promise that
the prototype will be ready tomorrow.

16:05.520 --> 16:09.360
Do what you like with your life at night,
but I won't let you ruin mine.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.200
This is very important.
There's a lot riding on it.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.040
-It won't happen again.
-Okay, let's see how you fix it.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.760
If you haven't slept all night,
it won't be easy.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.960
Alberto, supervise the project.
Keep an eye on him.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.440
This is your last chance.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.240
Come on, guys! Let's do this!

16:56.320 --> 16:59.400
Marga, do you know
where they keep the cans of gasoline here?

17:00.160 --> 17:03.320
I'm sure there are some
in the installers' parking lot.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.000
Why?

17:05.480 --> 17:08.119
No reason. An engineer told me
they had run out.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.200
Mr. Cifuentes, do you need something?

17:12.520 --> 17:14.920
I'm looking for Ángeles Vidal.
Has she come back yet?

17:15.000 --> 17:15.839
Back from where?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.840
Has something happened?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.119
Look...

17:26.400 --> 17:27.920
the police were here.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.600
They found a body in the river,

17:30.800 --> 17:33.520
and they think
it belongs to Ángeles' husband.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.560
What?

17:35.080 --> 17:36.400
No, it can't be.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.160
-Oh, my God.
-No, no, take it easy.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.440
Calm down, Marga.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.760
Do you know where she is now?

17:43.840 --> 17:46.840
A few hours ago, she went to the morgue
with Inspector Cuevas.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.880
Lidia went with them, too.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.200
Don't worry. As soon as we see them,
we'll let you know.

17:54.760 --> 17:55.920
Thank you, Carlota.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.240
It would be best
if you don't repeat this to anyone.

18:00.320 --> 18:01.640
No, of course not.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.000
What are we going to do?

18:07.080 --> 18:09.760
Marga, first of all,
calm down and breathe.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.360
And let me think.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.640
Yes.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.000
Look, there he is.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.080
Excuse me!

18:27.240 --> 18:30.560
Could we speak to you
for a moment, please?

18:36.560 --> 18:37.600
Listen...

18:37.960 --> 18:39.600
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.800
Please, it will just take a moment.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.800
Listen to us.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.240
Is this your daughter?
Does she live here?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.560
No.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.960
Because she works in the city, right?

19:05.560 --> 19:07.320
You want to talk about that?

19:14.360 --> 19:17.080
In here, there is a large amount of money.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.200
Enough to be set for life.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.680
It's yours if you tell the police
there was another woman.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.440
One who looks nothing like me.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.040
Lidia hasn't done anything wrong.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.720
She's a good woman.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.800
She just wants a second chance,

19:39.400 --> 19:42.640
and you can have yours
if you accept that money.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.840
I don't want anything more
than what I have.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.600
And your daughter?

19:47.240 --> 19:49.040
I'm sure she's full of dreams,

19:49.960 --> 19:52.920
and this could be
the chance to fulfill them.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.440
You have until noon tomorrow.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.320
If you agree to collaborate
and keep the money,

20:04.560 --> 20:06.600
you have to call this phone number.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.240
Ask for Lidia Aguilar.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.280
-I've got bad news, Francisco.
-What a surprise.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.080
Tell me.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.520
The church has refused
to annul the marriage.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.760
We'll have to wait until death do us part.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.120
But we both signed the agreement.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.680
-Or maybe you didn't.
-I'm as anxious as you are

20:32.760 --> 20:36.200
to put an end to this,
but we're not the only ones involved.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.760
Carlos has used his connections
to stop the process.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.760
What?

20:41.320 --> 20:43.840
A close family friend told me
it was Carlos

20:43.920 --> 20:46.160
who intervened to stop the process.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.560
Very well. I'll take care of this matter.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.600
I don't care how you do it,
but the champagne has to be at 8 degrees,

20:56.680 --> 21:00.880
no more, no less, understood?
You may leave.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.080
I'm glad you are no longer pretending
to like me, Doña Carmen.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.680
It saves me the trouble.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.280
And why should I
have to try to fool anyone

21:11.360 --> 21:15.520
-or have them fool me?
-You see? It's better to speak frankly.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.080
I need your help.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.040
And why would I help you?

21:22.120 --> 21:25.400
Because you are as interested as I am
in what I've come to ask.

21:25.480 --> 21:29.800
Your son has stopped the annulment process
that Elisa and I had started.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.320
He has pulled some strings.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.600
Now I need you to pull yours.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.000
If my son intervened--

21:37.080 --> 21:40.560
He wants to keep me away from Lidia
so that he can marry her.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.320
I know you never liked me
as a husband for Elisa,

21:45.800 --> 21:49.440
but this is the perfect opportunity
for Lidia to disappear from your lives.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.480
If she decides on me, of course.

21:52.200 --> 21:56.480
Please, Francisco,
I played my cards a long time ago.

21:57.560 --> 22:01.560
It's quite possible that, at this moment,
that girl is not even pregnant anymore.

22:01.680 --> 22:02.680
What?

22:02.960 --> 22:06.920
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but women
are much more practical than men.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.600
Especially those
who know what it is to be poor.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.120
-You offered her money to get an abortion?
-I couldn't have said it better.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.000
Lidia would never make a deal with you.

22:16.640 --> 22:22.360
It's a pity this document will destroy
that idyllic image you have of that girl.

22:50.680 --> 22:54.200
-Was it really Mario, Carlota?
-Let's go and talk to Ángeles.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.400
What happened?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.440
What are you doing here?

22:59.520 --> 23:02.600
-Is it Mario?
-Weren't we in all this together?

23:02.680 --> 23:05.120
-Who told you?
-Carlos.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.080
He came to the switchboard
looking for you.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.000
Well, are you going to tell us?

23:24.560 --> 23:26.800
Mario's body was found in the river.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.200
The storms brought it to the surface.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.280
Oh, God.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.520
What are we going to do?

23:38.600 --> 23:40.600
Calm down, Marga, please.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.080
I don't want you to worry.

23:42.160 --> 23:47.760
If things get worse, if they get more
complicated, I'm going to take the blame.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.320
No one will do that
because it will all work out.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.040
And here I am planning my wedding.
I'll talk to Pablo.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.920
-Marga!
-I'm going to talk to Pablo.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.200
No, that's the opposite
of what we need to do.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.720
If we start acting strangely,
that could give us away.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.920
Maybe I could speak with my father and...

24:04.000 --> 24:05.920
He knows people... No, I don't know.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.240
Your father?
He doesn't even accept your independence.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.400
I'm trying to find a solution.
I don't want to go to prison.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.240
No one is going to prison!

24:16.320 --> 24:19.080
Ángeles and I
have taken care of everything.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.600
What?

24:24.040 --> 24:27.160
We spoke to the witness
who could place me near Mario's car.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.360
And?

24:29.040 --> 24:32.040
And if tomorrow before noon
we receive his call,

24:33.160 --> 24:35.240
everything will be okay.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.720
And if he doesn't call?

24:38.800 --> 24:43.840
As long as there's still hope,
we shouldn't think otherwise.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.280
You're fired!

25:38.800 --> 25:40.240
What is all this, Miguel?

25:42.440 --> 25:43.640
Look.

25:44.600 --> 25:48.320
I'll introduce you
to the only friend I have lately,

25:49.160 --> 25:51.880
the only one that understands me
and keeps me company.

25:52.360 --> 25:55.200
-Miguel, stop! Stop!
-Don't touch me!

26:00.240 --> 26:01.800
You can't keep doing this.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.920
You have to present the prototype
to the company tomorrow.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.280
Screw the company and screw the prototype.

26:09.160 --> 26:12.480
I got fired. And you know what?
I don't care.

26:14.960 --> 26:18.600
That's not true.
You're passionate about your work.

26:20.280 --> 26:23.440
What do you know?
You don't know me that well.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.800
When did I become your enemy?

26:27.240 --> 26:30.720
When you two started sidelining me
and left me alone.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.800
I don't know what you mean.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.840
I'm talking about Carlota, Sara.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.000
About Carlota.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.920
She's important to me, too, you know?

26:42.280 --> 26:44.080
Much more than you think.

26:45.120 --> 26:49.360
Since you turned up in our lives,
it's all gone to shit.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.040
Where do I fit in her life?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Tell me.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.920
When have I been part of
all those secrets you keep?

27:01.120 --> 27:03.400
-Miguel, I--
-Leave me be!

27:07.600 --> 27:08.840
Leave me alone!

27:11.720 --> 27:13.840
After all, I'm already alone!

27:18.440 --> 27:20.080
How's the prototype going?

27:20.400 --> 27:22.160
It's almost ready, Miss Aguilar.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.560
We need to finish the structure
of the booth.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.920
You can go home.
Tomorrow will be a tough day.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.880
Thanks a lot.
We've made a lot of progress today.

27:35.960 --> 27:36.920
Mm-hmm.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.400
-See you tomorrow. Let's go, guys.
-See you tomorrow.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.200
Don't do it.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.280
Don't let that woman control your life.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.760
I don't know what you mean.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.400
Carmen told me everything.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.720
Lidia...

28:17.200 --> 28:19.920
I think we're all pushing you
into doing something

28:20.520 --> 28:22.120
you don't want to do.

28:23.640 --> 28:29.160
This stupid battle between me and Carlos
to be with you isn't helping you at all.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.360
Forgive me.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.040
Come here.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.960
I wanted to tell you
I'm taking a step back...

28:43.560 --> 28:45.280
not because I don't love you.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.400
I can't stop doing that.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.680
I'm doing it so you can decide
without any pressure,

28:53.760 --> 28:57.400
without anyone forcing you to do
something you may regret tomorrow.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.280
Recognizing an opportunity

29:01.360 --> 29:04.560
and making the most of it
means facing new risks.

29:23.040 --> 29:28.520
Ultimately, you never know if your attempt
to take advantage of a situation

29:28.600 --> 29:31.080
will actually complicate matters more.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.840
That's why,
when you've made a decision,

29:46.520 --> 29:48.800
it's better to stop questioning yourself,

29:49.200 --> 29:53.560
and just be prepared
to face the consequences.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.320
Murder in Madrid! Extra, extra!

30:15.400 --> 30:19.280
Murder in Madrid! Extra, extra!
Murder in Madrid!

30:20.040 --> 30:21.600
MURDER AT THE TELEPHONE COMPANY

30:27.120 --> 30:29.120
How can you come to work, dear?

30:29.200 --> 30:31.480
-My condolences.
-Thanks, Aurora.

30:31.560 --> 30:34.240
I'm so sorry, too, Ángeles.
Whatever you need...

30:34.320 --> 30:35.280
Thank you.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.440
Aren't you going to shed
a single tear?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.160
Get away from me!

30:50.040 --> 30:52.360
How I grieve for my husband
is none of your business.

30:52.440 --> 30:55.520
Anyone in your place
wouldn't be calmly strolling around here.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.560
Caroline, please, leave me alone.

30:57.640 --> 31:00.040
Did you decide to get revenge
on your own?

31:00.120 --> 31:03.320
-What?
-I won't stop, Ángeles.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.360
Not until you tell me the truth.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.520
-What truth?
-You killed him.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.240
-You're crazy!
-You killed him.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.240
Will you leave me alone!

31:15.720 --> 31:17.280
Ángeles! Ángeles!

31:19.240 --> 31:21.000
You won't get away with it.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.920
Such terrible news.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.840
Indeed. And with the king attending
the anniversary party today,

31:29.920 --> 31:31.360
it's very poor timing.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.600
What? The man's dead.
We can't do anything for him.

31:36.680 --> 31:40.520
Let's concentrate on saving this company.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.960
I didn't know circumstances were so dire.

31:43.040 --> 31:48.160
If His Majesty the King discovers
that the company isn't in Cifuentes hands,

31:48.240 --> 31:50.920
he will not renew our contract,
and believe me,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.400
that'll be the end of the company.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.560
Any suggestion on how to avoid that?

31:57.920 --> 32:03.080
My son Carlos will unveil
the phone booths tonight.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.800
Come on, Doña Carmen.

32:07.080 --> 32:10.160
We have to present ourselves
as a modern company.

32:10.640 --> 32:13.120
A woman should do the unveiling tonight.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.480
It's not a suggestion.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.920
Either my son Carlos makes
the presentation tonight,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.120
or I will personally tell the king

32:22.200 --> 32:25.040
that the company is no longer
in our hands.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.000
This is no way to do things.

32:28.200 --> 32:31.160
You know as well as I do
that it was Miss Aguilar's idea.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.360
No company has ever been
in the hands of a woman.

32:34.440 --> 32:37.360
We'd be the laughingstock
of all of Spain.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.920
Some things should change.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.560
To my knowledge, up until now,

32:41.640 --> 32:45.560
no woman has ever been able to run
a business this important.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.320
Choose.

32:47.400 --> 32:52.800
Either my son Carlos
presents the phone booths tonight,

32:53.120 --> 32:55.120
or you're left without a company.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.240
Putting you through.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.200
Any news on the witness?

33:16.560 --> 33:19.600
-He'll call. There's still time.
-Hey, you!

33:20.800 --> 33:22.320
They want you upstairs.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.080
That bitch wants to catch us off guard.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.160
Tell me if something happens.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.520
What's wrong now?

33:45.600 --> 33:47.440
Father Fermín's not coming to dinner.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.080
Fine, he can come another day.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.000
Marga, are you all right?

33:52.080 --> 33:54.960
-I'm in no mood for nonsense.
-It's not nonsense. It's serious.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.760
-It's only a wedding.
-Only a wedding?

33:56.840 --> 33:59.320
It's our wedding,
and it might not happen.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.680
What? What are you saying?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.160
Well...

34:04.240 --> 34:07.240
Pablo, I don't know,
maybe it's not that important.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.800
-Marga.
-Operator 47. Go ahead.

34:10.880 --> 34:11.840
Pablo!

34:11.920 --> 34:12.920
Very well.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.360
Putting you through.

34:16.199 --> 34:21.320
No, Lidia's not here,
but I have the money.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.760
We can close the deal.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.280
Good afternoon.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.719
Inspector, thank you
for coming down again.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.360
Your call sounded important.
What is it?

34:40.719 --> 34:41.760
Gee!

34:42.679 --> 34:44.000
Interesting.

34:44.080 --> 34:48.239
The fabric covering the corpse
had this embroidery.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.639
It was so dirty it couldn't be seen
under the muck.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.240
Clearly, this man didn't leave
the company alive that night.

34:54.320 --> 34:58.080
So it seems. Someone killed him
and wrapped him in this tablecloth.

35:00.800 --> 35:06.160
The ropes that bound the body
weren't normal ropes.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.120
They were telephone cables.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.520
I hope this helps you, Inspector.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.120
It certainly does.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.400
Thanks a lot.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.080
...the telephone for everyone.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.320
You didn't like it, did you?

35:30.040 --> 35:31.480
Do you want me to change it?

35:32.280 --> 35:33.440
No, no, no.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.480
The speech is perfect, Miss Aguilar.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.520
What's the problem?

35:39.600 --> 35:42.280
-She's the problem.
-What's that?

35:42.640 --> 35:46.080
Look, I was thinking and...

35:47.160 --> 35:48.480
I've made a decision.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.240
Carlos will present the project tonight.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.480
What?

35:53.560 --> 35:55.960
She's been preparing this for days.
It's her project.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.680
-Why wouldn't she present it?
-It's because I'm a woman.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.760
It's my idea
and I worked like a dog for it,

36:01.840 --> 36:04.520
but it won't be appreciated
because I'm not in a suit and tie.

36:04.600 --> 36:09.800
-You did an impeccable job, Lidia--
-Yes, but the credit will go to a man.

36:09.880 --> 36:13.000
Look, I can't change
the country we're living in.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.560
Can you imagine the scandal
of a woman heading a project like this?

36:18.160 --> 36:22.680
You told me to fight
and show you what I was worth.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.320
That it didn't matter
if I was a man or a woman.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.480
Yes, and it doesn't matter, to me.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.840
But what will the king think
of a woman in charge of this?

36:31.960 --> 36:34.120
The government is about to renew
the company's contract,

36:34.200 --> 36:35.880
and we can't risk it.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.160
And Doña Carmen assures me

36:39.240 --> 36:42.080
that it's best for everyone
if Carlos makes the presentation.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.560
So it was her idea
and she convinced you.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.840
The decision is mine.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.000
It's best for everyone.
End of discussion.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.560
It's funny.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.960
It's funny because...

36:52.040 --> 36:57.680
you boasted about having
a new, modern company.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.720
Maybe you should consider changing
tonight's speech...

37:03.560 --> 37:05.520
so that no one is scandalized.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.480
TELEPHONE COMPANY

37:10.560 --> 37:12.880
That's fine, you may carry on.

37:17.280 --> 37:20.200
How did you get Uribe
to remove Lidia from the presentation?

37:20.280 --> 37:22.880
What are you doing?
You forget that I'm your mother.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.680
It's her project.
She doesn't deserve this.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.320
How can you be so cruel?

37:26.400 --> 37:29.360
Life is always cruel for women.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.720
A lowly secretary leading
the project tonight

37:32.800 --> 37:37.280
would mean a huge scandal
and irreparable damage to the company.

37:37.360 --> 37:41.480
You knew it was Lidia's chance to shine
and you took it from her.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.720
Stop whining.

37:43.520 --> 37:47.240
If I've learned anything in life it's that
women shouldn't be at the forefront.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.160
Luckily, not all women are like you.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.520
Of course they are.

37:50.600 --> 37:55.200
We do what it takes to survive,
but we do it in the shadows.

37:55.280 --> 37:59.200
You're an expert at that,
moving in the shadows like a sewer rat.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.240
You're so ungrateful!
I did all this for you!

38:03.320 --> 38:06.400
All that I care about
is what's best for my family.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.720
Then you're doing something wrong,

38:08.440 --> 38:10.640
because you'll only manage
to end up alone.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.880
Thank you.

38:17.960 --> 38:22.520
Just one more thing before I accept
your invitation to the party, Sebastián.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.680
What do you really want from me?

38:25.240 --> 38:26.880
I'm not naive.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.200
I helped you break free
from your mother's scheme, right?

38:32.560 --> 38:35.040
Now I need you to help me.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.200
What's this about?

38:40.720 --> 38:42.000
About us getting married.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.000
You Argentinians sure are direct.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.800
While I do love that smile,

38:50.880 --> 38:53.160
it just so happens
the Spanish government demands

38:53.240 --> 38:55.760
that the company
must be owned by Spanish citizens.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.400
A marriage of convenience.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.160
What do I get in exchange?

39:00.480 --> 39:02.640
30% of the company.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.360
This is becoming the least romantic date
in history.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.280
I love that smile.

39:12.480 --> 39:16.440
Sebastián, don't think that
I don't want to help you...

39:18.040 --> 39:20.240
but things are more difficult for me.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.640
I can't get married.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.560
They just rejected
my marriage annulment.

39:27.640 --> 39:32.680
My medical history precludes me from
being able to solve the issue on my own,

39:33.560 --> 39:37.160
and my brother has stopped
the process for personal reasons.

39:37.240 --> 39:41.200
Gosh, you really are a happy family.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.080
I imagine there are secrets
in yours, too.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.560
I won't deny that.

39:47.880 --> 39:48.880
Elisa...

39:49.600 --> 39:52.720
if you assure me
that our agreement will move forward,

39:53.680 --> 39:55.920
I'll get you the annulment.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.520
It's a deal.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.440
Lidia.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.680
Carlos, not now, please.

40:16.760 --> 40:19.640
I didn't mess with the presentation.
If it were up to me, you'd do it.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.600
I don't care about the project
or the company.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.640
Then what's wrong?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Forget it.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.680
Is it about the baby?

40:33.840 --> 40:36.960
Lidia, we still have a chance.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.520
If you let me, I'll take care of it.
I want to start a family.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.680
-Please...
-It's true, Lidia.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.520
This child has opened my eyes.
This is the chance--

40:44.600 --> 40:47.720
It's nothing! This is nothing.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.320
Let go of me, please.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.320
-What happened?
-The witness wanted more money.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.960
-What?
-Ángeles went to close the deal.

41:08.520 --> 41:10.440
-Do you know anything else?
-No.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.240
-File it.
-Yes, sir.

41:23.080 --> 41:23.920
Why are you here?

41:24.000 --> 41:26.800
The witness insisted on speaking
with you, Inspector.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.200
So?

41:28.280 --> 41:30.960
I remember something else
about the woman I saw that night.

41:31.640 --> 41:32.680
Yes?

41:34.200 --> 41:37.280
Men, I want you all
to keep your eyes peeled!

41:37.360 --> 41:40.040
Robles, you'll alert His Majesty,
got it?

41:40.120 --> 41:42.040
Come on, let's go!

41:43.360 --> 41:45.080
5TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE TELEPHONE COMPANY

41:45.160 --> 41:49.040
I heard, your Majesty, that Barcelona
is worth visiting to see the World Expo.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.480
A marvel, an essential visit,

41:50.560 --> 41:52.560
and barely 24 hours
by train from Madrid.

41:52.640 --> 41:55.360
The world's progressing
as fast as that train, isn't it?

41:55.440 --> 42:00.160
And we're grateful that
you want to travel with us, Majesty.

42:00.240 --> 42:05.920
We Cifuenteses know you've always been
a good luck charm for our company.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.640
I'm sure you'll continue to be
for the new project,

42:09.720 --> 42:12.880
conceived by my son Carlos.
He takes after his father.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.160
Don't underestimate yourself, mother.
Carlos takes after you, too.

42:16.240 --> 42:19.240
Elisa, excellent timing.

42:19.320 --> 42:22.400
Majesty, let me introduce my fiancée.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.520
Well!

42:23.600 --> 42:25.920
It's good news for the Cifuentes family,

42:26.000 --> 42:29.080
-so I think you'll be happy, too.
-Congratulations to you both.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.560
-Thank you.
-I need to go to the powder room.

42:31.640 --> 42:33.240
-Will you accompany me, Elisa?
-Of course.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.320
I'll be right with you, Majesty.

42:39.360 --> 42:42.240
Majesty, if you please,
we can take our seats.

42:42.720 --> 42:46.080
You must be truly unbalanced
to do this.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.360
On the contrary, Mother.

42:47.440 --> 42:50.360
This is the most rational decision
I've made in my life.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.800
I deserve my chance,
and now it's finally come.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.760
Please, you've had everything
you've ever wanted.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.960
-What else do you want?
-Mother, don't bother.

42:59.040 --> 43:02.280
From now on, I'll be pulling the strings.

43:02.360 --> 43:05.320
-That remains to be seen.
-Enjoy your party.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.120
Good evening.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.680
Good evening, everyone.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.720
Majesty, thank you for honoring us
with your presence again.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.320
-Is Ángeles here yet?
-No.

43:20.880 --> 43:23.160
I'm glad to see you all
looking so elegant,

43:23.240 --> 43:25.880
as this night will be remembered
for a long time.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.040
Today, the history of the telephone
will change forever,

43:29.120 --> 43:31.560
and you are all privileged to witness it.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.600
I've always dreamed of revolutionizing
the world of telecommunications,

43:35.680 --> 43:37.720
of reaching new heights.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.320
But you can't do that
without first looking around you.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.800
You have to be on the streets
with the people,

43:42.880 --> 43:44.720
which is something
I wouldn't have learned...

43:48.080 --> 43:49.840
if not for Miss Aguilar.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.600
Hers is the brilliant mind
behind this idea.

43:55.280 --> 43:56.880
So, Lidia...

43:57.760 --> 43:59.800
you should be up here, not me.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.360
Please, a round of applause.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.240
Good evening.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.800
Ten years ago...

44:21.120 --> 44:22.480
I arrived in Madrid...

44:23.880 --> 44:26.240
and lost someone very important to me.

44:28.680 --> 44:29.640
And if...

44:30.920 --> 44:33.960
at that time, I'd had within my reach

44:34.040 --> 44:39.640
a telephone to make just one phone call...

44:39.720 --> 44:42.160
maybe my future
would've been different.

44:42.920 --> 44:47.200
That's why this project
affects me so personally.

44:47.880 --> 44:51.920
It's true that an idea,
just an idea, isn't much on its own,

44:53.160 --> 44:55.760
and I wouldn't be here
in front of you

44:55.840 --> 44:57.640
presenting this project
if it weren't for...

44:58.160 --> 45:00.560
the person who trusted in me.

45:02.720 --> 45:06.960
And who opened the doors
of this company to me.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.080
We present...

45:11.040 --> 45:13.040
public telephone booths.

45:28.200 --> 45:29.600
Who's that girl?

45:30.400 --> 45:33.040
She's heading the project.

45:33.640 --> 45:34.640
Splendid.

45:41.440 --> 45:45.040
You four, cover the rear exit.
The rest of you, with me.

45:45.880 --> 45:46.800
Let's go.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.040
You two, the alley.

45:50.240 --> 45:53.600
Please, clear the street.
There's nothing to see here. Go on!

46:00.800 --> 46:02.280
Nobody move, please!

46:02.920 --> 46:05.080
Everyone remain inside the hall.

46:14.400 --> 46:17.520
We have proof that the person
who is responsible

46:17.600 --> 46:19.120
for Mario Pérez's murder is here.

46:19.200 --> 46:21.000
Freedom or imprisonment.

46:21.080 --> 46:22.640
Success or failure.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.520
When you strive
to accomplish something big,

46:25.600 --> 46:29.600
the outcome can extend far
beyond your efforts,

46:30.640 --> 46:32.520
and it can impact everybody else.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.640
Carolina Moreno, you're under arrest
for the murder of Mario Pérez.

46:36.720 --> 46:39.000
No, this is a mistake!
Let go of me!

46:39.080 --> 46:41.960
Let go! I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

46:42.040 --> 46:44.440
Let me go! I didn't do anything!

46:51.280 --> 46:54.480
I have nothing to do with this!
Let go of me!
