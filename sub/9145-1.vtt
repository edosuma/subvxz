00:24.600 --> 00:26.279
Once upon a time,

00:26.280 --> 00:28.203
humans lived with many other creatures,

00:28.640 --> 00:31.120
including monsters.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.962
But humans wanted to monopolise the world,

00:34.280 --> 00:36.203
and so they declared war on monsters.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.679
The monsters lost...

00:38.680 --> 00:40.250
and were expelled to remote mountains.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.720
They were not allowed to cross
the border ever since.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.626
Now,

00:47.680 --> 00:49.360
there is a civil war in the monster world.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.010
The old Monster King was killed.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.364
To totally cut off the old king's power,

00:54.560 --> 00:59.885
the new Monster King massacred
the loyal former ministers.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.220
And,

01:16.280 --> 01:19.250
the old Queen is pregnant.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.809
Escaping from the killers sent
by the new Monster King,

01:23.400 --> 01:25.721
she is forced to flee to the human world...

01:26.280 --> 01:29.807
under the protection of
surviving supporters.

01:32.600 --> 01:33.839
Legend says that...

01:33.840 --> 01:35.559
this expected baby king...

01:35.560 --> 01:39.849
will change both the human
and monster worlds.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.300
(Monster language) Your Majesty, run!

02:37.400 --> 02:39.801
(Monster language) Hands off my baby!

02:51.600 --> 02:55.161
(Monster language) Your Majesty,
we're here to save you!

03:01.760 --> 03:03.520
(Monster language) Watch
out, Your Highness!

03:09.400 --> 03:11.971
(Monster language) I can't walk anymore.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.761
(Monster language) What are you staring at?
She's my wife!

04:21.839 --> 04:25.401
"Yongning Village"

04:25.720 --> 04:27.460
Mayor, hurry up.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.420
Be careful.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.879
Come on! Faster!

04:31.880 --> 04:33.039
I picked it first. Give it to me.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.359
It's mine. Let me have it.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.931
Our mayor is coming.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.679
Stop fighting.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.227
Here's the mayor.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.129
Mama Li, Auntie Mo,

04:45.520 --> 04:46.559
we all live in the same village...

04:46.560 --> 04:48.061
Shut up!

04:48.400 --> 04:49.399
It's a mayor's job to...

04:49.400 --> 04:50.799
Quiet!

04:50.800 --> 04:52.450
- I'm the mayor and...
- Have you fixed the clothes?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.386
Have you fixed the clothes?

04:54.600 --> 04:55.828
Not yet.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.370
He's our mayor!

05:01.600 --> 05:03.409
You ladies shouldn't treat him like that.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.062
Mayor,

05:10.440 --> 05:11.862
your leg brace.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.667
Xiaowu,

05:14.880 --> 05:16.267
sorry.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.645
Go and fix our clothes.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.319
Xiaowu,

05:25.320 --> 05:26.548
thanks.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.022
No problem at all.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.066
I'll go deliver now.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.541
Grandma?

05:36.400 --> 05:37.947
Grandma?

05:59.840 --> 06:01.023
Grand...

06:03.560 --> 06:04.359
Who are you?

06:04.360 --> 06:05.199
Tianyin.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.479
Who is Tianyin?

06:06.480 --> 06:07.639
Your grandson.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.141
Who's grandson?

06:09.880 --> 06:11.450
Your son's son.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.885
My son is first-tier palace
swordsman Song Daitian.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.759
Let me tell you.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.159
This is our Song family heritage...

06:18.160 --> 06:20.128
monster killing sword!

06:20.400 --> 06:22.129
It's actually more like a toy.

06:23.720 --> 06:24.879
I won't play with you.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.222
You're so dumb.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.426
You don't understand a thing.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.119
Hanging around with nothing to do,

06:30.120 --> 06:31.951
you really don't act like a man.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.711
I'm busy every day,

06:34.880 --> 06:35.919
sewing and cooking.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.048
Did you practice our Song family
special moves today?

06:38.120 --> 06:39.269
No.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.129
You are such a loser.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.079
Grandma will leave home for a few days...

06:47.080 --> 06:48.079
to look for your dad.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.359
Grandma,

06:49.360 --> 06:51.169
you've been searching
for that guy for years.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.827
Shouldn't you give up?

06:53.080 --> 06:56.243
Your dad is the hero
of the Monster Hunt Bureau.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.280
What kind of hero dumps his wife and son?

06:58.360 --> 06:59.519
Coward!

06:59.520 --> 07:00.279
Your dad is...

07:00.280 --> 07:01.964
a first-tier palace swordsman.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.048
He left the whole village to you,

07:04.240 --> 07:05.639
so protecting the villagers is...

07:05.640 --> 07:06.559
My duty.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.085
Then you shouldn't fall
short of your dad's...

07:08.160 --> 07:09.627
Expectations.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.581
See you.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.407
Monsters are not accepted
in the human world.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.199
If any of them crossed the border,

07:38.200 --> 07:41.921
we used to have the Monster Hunt Bureau
take care of them.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.009
And they did such a good job that

07:44.440 --> 07:46.281
people nowadays don't know
monsters even exist.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.045
Since the last dynasty,

07:53.680 --> 07:56.809
almost all monsters crossing
the border were caught.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.039
The Monster Hunt Bureau...

07:59.040 --> 08:00.599
became useless and closed.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.125
Great monster hunters like you
turned into normal people...

08:02.240 --> 08:04.925
and served small businessmen like me.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.985
You were totally wronged.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.479
Now,

08:08.480 --> 08:10.403
your time has come!

08:26.040 --> 08:27.462
If one of you...

08:27.760 --> 08:29.762
can grab that expected baby monster king,

08:30.040 --> 08:31.849
the monster world will be in chaos...

08:32.000 --> 08:33.519
and monsters will flee all over.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.861
Then,

08:35.080 --> 08:38.846
the emperor must rely on you all
to suppress them.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.964
The Monster Hunt Bureau
will be strong again.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.999
Come on.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.525
Let's toast to our great fortune.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.599
Cheers!

08:50.600 --> 08:52.590
Cheers!

09:01.160 --> 09:03.322
I was so awesome.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.929
I hit his belly with my head.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.729
You didn't see how...

09:11.520 --> 09:13.284
Hi, how are you?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.050
Smells delicious!

09:31.080 --> 09:32.399
We can have something to eat.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.439
Right,

09:33.440 --> 09:34.965
my restaurant is that way.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.305
We offer high-quality herbal tea.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.648
And we have our signature dish,
duck blood pudding.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.319
Stop chatting with this limp.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.582
We're in a hurry!

09:42.720 --> 09:44.062
Ignore him!

09:44.080 --> 09:45.650
He's jealous...

09:45.920 --> 09:47.660
when I pay attention to others.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.600
Because I'm his...

09:51.880 --> 09:53.347
first love.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.009
Why do you tell that to everyone you meet?

09:56.280 --> 09:57.930
I won't tell you anything anymore!

09:58.640 --> 10:00.244
He's blushing!

10:00.400 --> 10:01.359
See,

10:01.360 --> 10:03.010
he looks so cute when he blushes!

10:03.120 --> 10:04.826
You're mean and crazy!

10:04.920 --> 10:06.148
Let's

10:06.360 --> 10:07.559
He's not going,

10:07.560 --> 10:08.947
but I Will.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.265
Fine, fine, fine! I'll go.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.039
Our Yongning Village...

10:15.040 --> 10:16.565
hasn't had visitors for ages.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.759
Can you tell me...

10:18.760 --> 10:19.999
about your adventures?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.581
Sure.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.359
I'll tell you...

10:23.360 --> 10:25.010
while I eat you...

10:26.240 --> 10:27.901
your food.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.987
This way.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.826
Here we are.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.467
Please take a seat.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.187
Let me...

10:48.400 --> 10:50.607
I will get you some water.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.426
Thanks.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.011
What would you like to order?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.969
- We...
- Ls there any human meat...

11:23.000 --> 11:24.831
or human liver?

11:32.920 --> 11:33.959
It's only me here.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.541
How about eating me first?

11:43.440 --> 11:44.960
I'll bring you the duck blood pudding.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.679
No one is allowed to leave.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.719
Right,

11:47.720 --> 11:49.062
no one.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.530
Lady, what's your problem?

11:59.760 --> 12:00.799
Tell me your names!

12:00.800 --> 12:01.759
Song... Song Tianyin.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.147
Not you.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.124
I'm the gorgeous, elegant and

12:06.320 --> 12:07.924
coolest Lily.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.159
When did you make that up?

12:09.160 --> 12:09.959
Just now.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.480
I like your original name Ying better.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.500
How dare you hit my wife?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.002
Your skills are medio... cre...

12:59.160 --> 13:01.561
Still mediocre?

13:06.240 --> 13:07.969
If I wasn't injured earlier,

13:08.280 --> 13:10.601
just a level two monster hunter like you...

13:11.240 --> 13:13.004
I'll be promoted to level three
after I've captured you both.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.770
Little monster, what's your name?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.008
Gao.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.250
Hiding in such a skinny shell...

13:42.360 --> 13:44.066
is killing me!

13:44.080 --> 13:45.079
See, we have serious business,

13:45.080 --> 13:46.600
and all you can think about is eating!

13:47.080 --> 13:48.923
But that limp smells delicious.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.079
You never learn.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.941
(Monster language) Ma ta ta ku la.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.799
Foul language?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.643
(Monster language) You say that again and

13:55.800 --> 13:57.680
(Monster language) I'll kick your ass
very hard.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.568
Oh, baby. You're right.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.380
It's all my fault.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.209
Oh no, Her Majesty fell out!

14:11.360 --> 14:12.668
Save the queen!

14:28.640 --> 14:29.479
Freeze!

14:29.480 --> 14:31.120
I won't look. I won't look. I won't look.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.106
Freeze!

14:34.240 --> 14:35.946
Ying, I'll save you.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.020
Duo Ian bu lu ye.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.340
An ya hong.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.599
Luogang!

15:15.600 --> 15:17.590
They are mine.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.679
How can you say...

15:18.680 --> 15:20.341
they're yours?

15:20.360 --> 15:21.439
Whoever has the monsters...

15:21.440 --> 15:22.827
gets the money.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.404
Your Highness! Run!

15:36.800 --> 15:37.599
Luogang!

15:37.600 --> 15:38.799
This is not fair.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.999
To me,

15:40.000 --> 15:41.387
this is totally fair.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.987
Thief!

15:52.240 --> 15:53.679
I'm the mayor in this village.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.261
You've just killed people.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.639
What people did I kill?

15:57.640 --> 15:58.919
They're all monsters!

15:58.920 --> 16:00.103
Monsters?

16:00.520 --> 16:01.907
Of course.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.684
They're monsters covered with human skin.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.243
Ignorant.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.479
Monsters are the most cunning creatures...

16:10.480 --> 16:12.359
in the world.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.599
They hide in human skin,

16:13.600 --> 16:14.679
dress as humans...

16:14.680 --> 16:16.511
and speak human language!

16:17.840 --> 16:19.239
Then how can I tell...

16:19.240 --> 16:20.901
if you're human or monster?

16:39.320 --> 16:40.901
May I ask you something?

16:41.240 --> 16:43.163
Did you win or lose the fight just now?

16:45.280 --> 16:46.884
I lost?

16:47.200 --> 16:49.362
If I lost, you'd have been eaten by them.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.303
Idiot!

16:54.120 --> 16:55.639
Make dinner!

16:55.640 --> 16:57.141
I'm hungry!

17:00.080 --> 17:01.627
I want something spicy!

17:06.560 --> 17:08.483
Question me?

17:08.599 --> 17:10.159
So stupid.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.288
How could someone like me lose?

17:18.880 --> 17:20.118
Can't stop talking,

17:20.119 --> 17:21.701
but can cook quite well.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.319
Even though I'm a bit crippled,

17:23.319 --> 17:25.079
I do have great goals.

17:25.079 --> 17:26.039
You know what?

17:26.040 --> 17:27.769
Cooking is my third ideal job.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.599
How about the second?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.908
Sewing.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.010
Want to guess what's the first?

17:34.280 --> 17:35.159
How about the first?

17:35.160 --> 17:36.799
The first is cooking plus sewing.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.347
I'm a genius, right?

17:49.480 --> 17:51.140
Why would you catch monsters?

17:51.520 --> 17:52.862
To make money.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.620
Then why are you alone?

17:56.840 --> 17:57.839
Want to know?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.119
Yes.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.770
People who know too much about me...

18:01.080 --> 18:02.820
I'll have their tongue cut off.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.146
Where're you going?

18:17.240 --> 18:19.071
I'll sleep in my Grandma's room.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.764
Sleep with me.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.679
I stay here...

18:28.680 --> 18:30.670
so that I can sleep with you.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.519
<i>You'?</i>

18:33.520 --> 18:34.987
Hmm.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.266
I'll go to prepare.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.187
You like it this way?

19:11.920 --> 19:12.919
Will it hurt?

19:12.920 --> 19:14.387
What?

19:14.480 --> 19:15.639
What do you expect?

19:15.640 --> 19:17.141
I'll gouge out your eyes!

19:29.400 --> 19:31.004
That monster spat on you

19:31.160 --> 19:32.479
to leave a mark,

19:32.480 --> 19:34.279
which means she will find you again.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.079
When she comes back,

19:35.080 --> 19:37.082
she won't be able to escape my trap.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.568
"Mi gu ba."

20:18.960 --> 20:22.726
"Nu gu ba ta gu ba."

20:23.000 --> 20:26.800
"Tu gu ba ka gu ba,"

20:27.200 --> 20:31.683
"yi ya gu ba."

20:33.360 --> 20:35.601
"Mi gu ba."

20:35.920 --> 20:39.606
"Nu gu ba ta gu ba."

20:40.000 --> 20:43.482
"Tu gu ba, let me go!"

20:43.920 --> 20:49.768
"yi ya gu ba."

20:53.480 --> 20:56.165
"it can be sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy"

20:56.440 --> 20:59.091
"while you struggle for life."

20:59.280 --> 21:04.764
"Living is an ongoing argument with"

21:05.360 --> 21:07.761
"many complex appearances..."

21:08.200 --> 21:10.851
"and cunning souls."

21:11.160 --> 21:16.371
"So-called living is just
a battle of slaughtering."

21:16.720 --> 21:19.485
"Who can ask for living in affluence?"

21:19.840 --> 21:22.366
"Earning just enough to
survive is not bad."

21:22.640 --> 21:25.883
"Today you have power,"

21:26.000 --> 21:28.321
"but tomorrow you may be at the bottom."

21:28.640 --> 21:31.450
"Hopeless? No alternatives? So what?"

21:31.680 --> 21:34.160
"But having an empty stomach
is really a problem."

21:34.440 --> 21:42.440
"Wouldn't it be nice to have a small piece
of rice cake?"

21:43.840 --> 21:45.365
"it's all dry."

21:45.760 --> 21:48.366
"My tongue is so dry."

21:48.880 --> 21:51.531
"Hard living..."

21:51.760 --> 21:54.730
"keeps trampling on us."

21:56.160 --> 21:57.999
"Terrible."

21:58.000 --> 22:00.651
"I'm not young anymore."

22:00.920 --> 22:03.685
"Like a wretch, cinders,"

22:03.920 --> 22:07.561
"setting sun."

22:07.720 --> 22:10.530
"Either humans or monsters have trouble."

22:10.640 --> 22:13.211
"Even lovers can't survive without food."

22:13.640 --> 22:16.325
"Play any extra roles just to get by."

22:16.480 --> 22:19.211
"But nothing can be done right."

22:19.440 --> 22:22.250
"if you can give me
a steamed pork dumpling,"

22:22.440 --> 22:25.125
"I will do anything for you."

22:25.200 --> 22:30.525
"To live is not easy at all."

22:30.600 --> 22:31.759
"Sweet, sour, bitter, spicy."

22:31.760 --> 22:34.491
"Grievance and struggle."

22:34.560 --> 22:37.325
"Too complicated in the human world."

22:37.400 --> 22:40.370
"it is also not easy in the monster world."

22:40.440 --> 22:43.250
"Both humans and monsters have
a lot to worry about."

22:43.520 --> 22:45.841
"Why think too much? Why not be happy?"

22:45.920 --> 22:48.321
"Let's laugh and cry together..."

22:48.400 --> 22:53.770
"and give each other a hug."

22:56.680 --> 22:58.399
We have to look for Her Majesty.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.080
She should've gone back to find that limp.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.067
What do you want?

24:18.360 --> 24:19.959
(Monster language) I'm dying.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.043
(Monster language) I beg you,
please save my baby.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.763
Can you speak... human language?

24:27.360 --> 24:28.999
(Monster language) I'm dying.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.049
(Monster language) I beg you,
please save my baby.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.261
Duo Ian bu lu ye

25:16.880 --> 25:18.660
Giant monster, I'll capture you.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.349
Freeze.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.429
Freeze.

26:06.840 --> 26:11.164
(Monster language) Please. Protect my baby.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.467
Run!

27:17.800 --> 27:19.319
Almost time for dinner.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.243
Great, can't wait.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.047
Xiaowu, who are they?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.865
What is going on?

27:45.160 --> 27:46.889
Still alive.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.884
Surely costly.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.679
Come, come, come.

27:50.680 --> 27:52.102
Sit, sit, sit.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.626
Two solutions.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.542
First,

27:58.560 --> 28:00.085
be pregnant for nine months.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.039
You'll give birth...

28:02.040 --> 28:03.701
sooner or later.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.062
Impossible!

28:05.120 --> 28:06.239
A man gives birth?

28:06.240 --> 28:07.866
Just let me die.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.159
Are you sure?

28:09.160 --> 28:10.359
I'm a man!

28:10.360 --> 28:11.599
I'd rather die than give birth!

28:11.600 --> 28:13.022
What a man!

28:14.400 --> 28:15.822
Bite this.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.308
Why?

28:22.440 --> 28:23.965
Simply make a cut here...

28:24.120 --> 28:25.781
and take it out.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.359
This is the second solution.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.639
If you cut it this way,

28:28.640 --> 28:30.221
will it be painful?

28:30.240 --> 28:31.639
I'll cut fast with my sword.

28:31.640 --> 28:32.319
Painless.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.548
No pain...

28:33.720 --> 28:35.119
but Will I die?

28:35.120 --> 28:36.542
Hard to tell.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.625
I'll be gentle.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.420
Forget it.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.146
I'd better keep it.

28:44.760 --> 28:45.679
Aren't you a man?

28:45.680 --> 28:47.420
I'll be one after giving birth.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.331
Trade in a monster inside a human.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.359
Good business.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.124
Then don't complain anymore.

29:14.960 --> 29:15.959
Cripple,

29:15.960 --> 29:17.268
put me down.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.741
You're trapped.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.879
I'll go to find help.

29:23.880 --> 29:24.999
Just wait for me here.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.831
Don't let me get you,

29:26.880 --> 29:28.689
or I'll kill you for sure.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.199
Gouge out your eyes,

29:30.200 --> 29:31.701
cut off your tongue!

29:32.200 --> 29:33.826
You cripple!

29:39.040 --> 29:40.871
Why so quiet?

29:41.880 --> 29:43.519
- Xiaowu.
- Who is it?

29:43.520 --> 29:44.759
It's Tianyin.

29:44.760 --> 29:45.799
Open the door.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.665
Lots of strangers came today.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.626
They caught all the villagers.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.279
Only you and me...

29:51.280 --> 29:52.959
are left.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.159
Don't worry.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.661
Let me come in first.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.342
Mayor.

30:03.120 --> 30:03.919
Who are you?

30:03.920 --> 30:05.729
It's me. Xiaowu.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.519
I look different...

30:07.520 --> 30:09.226
but I'm really Xiaowu.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.765
Mayor, you must save us.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.002
Your dad promised to protect us.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.239
You said...

30:16.240 --> 30:18.163
I'm your best friend.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.488
Are there any others hiding here?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.050
Weng ba zha hu lu hu lu.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.969
This is ridiculous.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.086
The whole village is full of monsters.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.848
It seems that Song Daitian...

31:28.040 --> 31:30.042
tried to secretly protect you.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.170
We did nothing wrong.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.559
We didn't hurt people.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.505
We're all vegetarian.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.085
It proves that Mr Song is right,

31:37.200 --> 31:39.407
humans and monsters can live together!

31:42.240 --> 31:45.369
As a former first-tier palace guard
from the Monster Hunter Bureau,

31:45.560 --> 31:47.721
Song Daitian complied in public
but opposed in private,

31:48.840 --> 31:50.968
which is a capital treason offense.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.250
We are not the problems.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.363
We just want to live peacefully.

31:57.640 --> 32:00.644
We're not planning to disturb anyone.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.279
Why can't you

32:02.280 --> 32:04.408
give us a chance?

32:04.520 --> 32:06.146
I won't argue with you.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.801
What I want is the monster queen...

32:12.320 --> 32:14.060
and the baby she carries.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.919
Who wants to tell me...

32:17.920 --> 32:19.319
in exchange for freedom?

32:19.320 --> 32:20.599
Stop asking!

32:20.600 --> 32:22.967
None of us will be a traitor!

32:23.120 --> 32:24.462
Hold on.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.527
Do you mean it?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.239
Mo,

32:29.240 --> 32:30.359
what are you doing?

32:30.360 --> 32:31.964
None of your business!

32:32.520 --> 32:33.719
Master,

32:33.720 --> 32:35.119
I know where they are!

32:35.120 --> 32:36.542
Traitor!

32:41.520 --> 32:42.862
Say it.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.907
Fire Beetle

33:16.200 --> 33:17.439
Since you disguise as humans,

33:17.440 --> 33:19.204
why not treat yourself better?

33:20.480 --> 33:22.084
Such a pity.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.107
Get them all.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.101
Grandma left all the villagers...

33:57.240 --> 33:58.890
to me...

34:00.080 --> 34:01.741
Just one evening.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.860
Everything is gone.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.025
Be optimistic.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.030
You still have an egg inside.

34:10.199 --> 34:11.761
Follow me to Shuntian City and sell it.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.440
I can give you 20 percent of the reward.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.409
Money...

34:15.480 --> 34:17.079
isn't important to me right now.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.599
That's great.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.147
I admire you.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.279
Then I'll give you 10 percent.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.639
No more bargaining.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.107
Let's go.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.964
Don't eat any more.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.644
Otherwise I'll suffer a loss.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.450
Just deduct it from my reward.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.741
Your noodles.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.046
I want two more bowls of noodles.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.199
Add sour sauce.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.559
The crazy-sour type.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.130
This is already crazy sour!

35:30.240 --> 35:32.481
I want the super super super
super super crazy-sour.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.747
You're super crazy!

35:37.920 --> 35:39.421
Wait.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.467
Stop eating.

35:42.760 --> 35:43.839
If Luogang catches you,

35:43.840 --> 35:45.365
he'll slice open your belly, no question.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.902
Run.

35:48.560 --> 35:49.719
You run...

35:49.720 --> 35:51.541
and wait for me at the back door.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.879
How have you been

36:08.880 --> 36:10.279
after robbing me?

36:10.280 --> 36:11.861
Where are the two monsters?

36:11.880 --> 36:12.879
Ran away.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.506
Ran away?

36:14.600 --> 36:16.039
Pay me back!

36:16.040 --> 36:17.804
Lower your voice. Come.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.047
Remember the monster who fled that day?

36:23.800 --> 36:25.319
The egg inside her...

36:25.320 --> 36:26.946
is very special.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.361
I think that monster sooner or later...

36:29.560 --> 36:32.131
will go back to the Village to look
for that guy.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.959
Let's work together...

36:33.960 --> 36:36.122
to catch her.

36:36.680 --> 36:37.959
How much is it worth?

36:37.960 --> 36:39.279
20 taels.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.850
Very special is only worth 20 taels?

36:42.880 --> 36:44.530
You really know the market.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.559
If you find it,

36:46.560 --> 36:47.788
5...

36:49.040 --> 36:49.839
100 taels.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.520
Wait till you pay me back the money first.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.204
Are we still working together?

37:02.120 --> 37:03.724
He's got a big belly.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.879
Eating again?

37:14.880 --> 37:16.188
Do you have money?

37:16.600 --> 37:17.919
No.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.359
That's why I keep eating...

37:19.360 --> 37:20.820
and wait for you to pay.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.159
Five dollars in total.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.369
Preserved ginger, dried salty plum,
lemon, hawthorn.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.420
Are you crazy?

37:30.680 --> 37:31.988
Go!

37:32.760 --> 37:34.227
Go!

37:41.960 --> 37:43.427
Go!

38:04.560 --> 38:06.027
This monster egg...

38:06.440 --> 38:08.039
is mine!

38:08.040 --> 38:09.199
Luogang,

38:09.200 --> 38:10.239
You're robbing me again.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.239
How can we work together?

38:11.240 --> 38:12.439
You lied to me.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.271
Cheater.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.107
Behind you!

38:26.480 --> 38:27.719
There's a monster behind you.

38:27.720 --> 38:28.759
I'm not lying.

38:28.760 --> 38:30.199
There's a monster behind you.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.667
I'm not lying.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.559
Stupid Luogang..

39:00.560 --> 39:01.319
If he dies,

39:01.320 --> 39:02.439
no one gets any money.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.907
Come help!

39:12.560 --> 39:13.439
I grab it,

39:13.440 --> 39:14.589
you capture it!

39:18.040 --> 39:19.746
Thank you very much.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.822
Let's

39:26.720 --> 39:28.484
Shouldn't we stay... and help him?

39:29.600 --> 39:30.599
He's a level four monster hunter.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.240
He should be able to handle it. Let's go!

39:39.080 --> 39:41.321
Huo Xiaolan!

40:42.040 --> 40:43.700
We would like to have a room.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.711
Only an expensive room is left.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.239
Do you want it?

40:47.240 --> 40:48.502
Yes.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.260
I don't feel like eating.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.021
You go.

40:59.480 --> 41:00.759
Human and monster.

41:00.760 --> 41:04.481
Would their baby be...

41:06.040 --> 41:07.587
a mutant baby?

41:08.080 --> 41:09.809
Crazy!

41:10.080 --> 41:11.467
Are you coming?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.128
Just don't search for
food in garbage at night.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.769
At least we should give the baby a name.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.239
One bowl of plain noodles.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.627
Yes.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.461
How old is he?

41:33.600 --> 41:35.306
Almost three years old.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.559
Look at him. So adorable.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.320
It'd be great if I could
have one of my own.

41:40.520 --> 41:41.999
Isn't he yours?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.889
He's this hotel owner's son.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.049
May I have your name?

41:49.360 --> 41:50.679
Huo Xiaolan.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.399
We're going to Shuntian City...

41:52.400 --> 41:54.241
for a very fancy banquet
at Heaven Restaurant.

41:54.440 --> 41:55.965
But the main reason is for my husband...

41:56.040 --> 41:57.565
to boost his health.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.649
So that I can have a baby.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.907
Do you understand?

42:04.400 --> 42:05.867
Yingying.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.547
Yingying.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.306
Why are you here?

42:09.560 --> 42:12.166
This is my husband Zhengtao.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.625
This is Miss Huo.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.159
Nice to meet you, Miss Huo.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.159
Let me tell you.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.889
We should hire a bodyguard...

42:19.040 --> 42:20.929
like them.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.849
They said... if hiring a bodyguard,

42:22.920 --> 42:25.048
we should look for those
with coins hanging on them...

42:25.120 --> 42:27.566
for prestige!

42:31.800 --> 42:32.719
Fine, fine, fine.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.460
I'll let you girls chat.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.359
Hurry, hurry.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.319
Quick!

42:58.320 --> 42:59.999
- Quicker!
- Quicker!

43:00.000 --> 43:00.999
Freeze!

43:01.000 --> 43:02.650
What's happening? OOPS!

43:11.400 --> 43:12.519
Wake up, wake up!

43:12.520 --> 43:13.679
Many monster hunters outside.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.545
Super dangerous. Let's leave.

43:23.840 --> 43:24.943
What's wrong?

43:25.280 --> 43:26.239
In labor?

43:26.240 --> 43:28.004
Probably, probably.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.319
Be quiet.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.199
Not good.

43:32.200 --> 43:33.279
Why are you in labor now?

43:33.280 --> 43:34.588
It's not up to me!

43:37.600 --> 43:39.967
What can we do? What to do?

43:42.080 --> 43:43.399
Go find a doctor.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.822
Right, right.

43:49.320 --> 43:50.319
Are you crazy?

43:50.320 --> 43:51.319
Who'd help you?

43:51.320 --> 43:52.981
Go find someone!

44:01.880 --> 44:03.780
How do people give birth? How to...

44:04.320 --> 44:06.482
Scissors, hot water, towels.

44:08.160 --> 44:10.025
I know what we should do.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.324
Don't be nervous. Relax, relax!

44:16.720 --> 44:18.187
Follow my instructions.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.431
Breathe out.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.329
Breathe in.

44:22.520 --> 44:23.679
Out.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.489
In

44:25.680 --> 44:26.519
Out

44:26.520 --> 44:27.359
In

44:27.360 --> 44:28.239
Out

44:28.240 --> 44:29.039
In

44:29.040 --> 44:29.919
Out

44:29.920 --> 44:31.039
In

44:31.040 --> 44:31.959
Out

44:31.960 --> 44:33.143
In

44:36.920 --> 44:38.626
You're an animal!

44:47.600 --> 44:48.862
What are you doing?

44:49.200 --> 44:50.079
Helping!

44:50.080 --> 44:51.760
How can you give birth with your pants on?

44:53.280 --> 44:54.479
Then why are you holding the scissors?

44:54.480 --> 44:55.867
To cut.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.180
How can you cut with your eyes shut?

45:08.160 --> 45:09.239
You'd better watch out.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.741
Don't cut it wrong!

45:12.760 --> 45:13.479
Should I cut it now...

45:13.480 --> 45:15.039
or after you give birth?

45:15.040 --> 45:16.599
Of course after!

45:16.600 --> 45:18.226
What's there to cut now?

45:23.040 --> 45:24.319
Something is already there!

45:24.320 --> 45:25.479
I've grabbed it!

45:25.480 --> 45:27.164
Should I cut it?

45:27.360 --> 45:29.169
You... You're got it wrong!

45:30.080 --> 45:31.627
Put down your scissors!

45:36.360 --> 45:37.479
Relax.

45:37.480 --> 45:38.759
- Push!
- The harder I push,

45:38.760 --> 45:40.439
the further it comes up!

45:40.440 --> 45:41.679
No, push it down!

45:41.680 --> 45:42.439
I feel like my belly is...

45:42.440 --> 45:44.044
going to explode...

45:44.120 --> 45:45.587
No, no!

45:46.280 --> 45:47.759
I give up.

45:47.760 --> 45:49.479
I give up!

45:49.480 --> 45:50.759
Push, push!

45:50.760 --> 45:52.705
Push harder!

45:54.720 --> 45:56.631
Is it Miss Huo?

45:56.680 --> 45:58.199
Are you okay?

45:58.200 --> 45:59.725
I'm fine. Thanks.

46:01.080 --> 46:01.759
Someone is outside.

46:01.760 --> 46:02.719
Let it out now!

46:02.720 --> 46:03.479
Quick!

46:03.480 --> 46:04.788
Something's wrong.

46:07.200 --> 46:07.999
Push.

46:08.000 --> 46:08.999
Now!

46:09.000 --> 46:10.945
Someone's having a baby!

46:11.720 --> 46:12.519
Yes.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.942
Stay outside.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.581
Who is she?

46:19.360 --> 46:20.399
My mother.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.482
Your mother is giving you a little brother?

46:23.080 --> 46:24.911
So lucky.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.821
Where's your father?

46:27.400 --> 46:29.209
He... died.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.489
I'm so sorry for your mother.

46:32.000 --> 46:32.839
But don't worry.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.199
Childbirth is my area of expertise.

46:34.200 --> 46:36.168
No. Although I've never given birth,

46:36.240 --> 46:37.719
I've read many books...

46:37.720 --> 46:38.759
and heard so much about it.

46:38.760 --> 46:39.719
I've been preparing all along...

46:39.720 --> 46:41.370
to give birth anytime.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.079
Excuse me,

46:43.080 --> 46:44.764
I'm just too excited.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.279
You gave birth to a white radish!

47:17.280 --> 47:18.667
Let me see!

47:21.600 --> 47:22.942
Be careful.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.105
A monster is a monster.

47:29.840 --> 47:31.182
Does it look like me?

47:32.880 --> 47:34.381
Sure.

47:45.880 --> 47:47.405
Do you need any help?

47:52.560 --> 47:55.040
Wake up, wake up.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.551
Good, this is better, darling.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.586
I saw...

48:01.160 --> 48:02.582
Nightmare?

48:02.960 --> 48:04.347
Right?

48:05.960 --> 48:06.799
Excuse us.

48:06.800 --> 48:07.919
We meant to help you,

48:07.920 --> 48:09.729
- but...
- Good that Madam is fine now.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.387
How's the baby?

48:12.640 --> 48:13.799
The baby is doing good.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.347
How is the baby's mother?

48:17.200 --> 48:19.089
I'm fine.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.402
Thank you.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.447
I've never seen someone stand up

48:24.760 --> 48:26.762
right after giving birth.

48:30.280 --> 48:32.111
Where's the baby's father?

48:32.440 --> 48:33.599
He died.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.987
What?

48:35.200 --> 48:36.804
I'm fine too.

48:37.120 --> 48:38.884
Thank you very much.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.890
The baby is so quiet.

48:44.680 --> 48:46.409
No crying-

48:53.800 --> 48:54.679
Where's Niuniu?

48:54.680 --> 48:56.022
Niuniu?

48:57.440 --> 48:58.479
Niuniu

48:58.480 --> 49:00.448
may have gone to see the baby.

49:00.920 --> 49:03.491
Does any of you inside see Niuniu?

49:12.240 --> 49:13.821
Don't hit him.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.142
What's that?

49:47.840 --> 49:49.705
Is everything okay?

49:51.960 --> 49:53.188
All good.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.865
Niuniu, you should come out.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.107
Wait.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.346
Oops, Madam faints again.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.710
What's wrong with you today?

51:10.360 --> 51:12.021
EXCUSE me, excuse me.

51:28.400 --> 51:29.599
Wow, really?

51:29.600 --> 51:31.443
They are monsters?

51:32.960 --> 51:34.279
Definitely.

51:34.280 --> 51:35.039
If you want,

51:35.040 --> 51:36.079
I can capture them for you.

51:36.080 --> 51:37.764
Capture? Go capture yourself!

51:39.960 --> 51:40.999
Have you two villagers...

51:41.000 --> 51:42.764
seen my son Daitian?

52:02.760 --> 52:04.307
Anybody?

52:18.200 --> 52:19.399
So hot.

52:19.400 --> 52:20.319
It's having a fever!

52:20.320 --> 52:21.821
Go get a towel.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.188
Get some water.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.280
Still very hot.
Change water, change water!

52:43.160 --> 52:44.582
Change again

52:59.040 --> 53:00.382
Okay, Okay.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.319
The fever is gone...

54:04.320 --> 54:05.890
but it's still weak.

54:06.240 --> 54:07.502
Oh,

54:07.760 --> 54:09.239
it hasn't had any milk...

54:09.240 --> 54:11.185
since it was born.

54:11.480 --> 54:14.086
No cows or goats around here.

54:14.440 --> 54:15.987
What can we do?

54:19.280 --> 54:20.759
Why are you looking at me?

54:20.760 --> 54:22.421
You're its mom!

54:23.480 --> 54:25.186
I don't have milk.

54:25.520 --> 54:27.146
I...

54:28.040 --> 54:29.963
It'll be sold in two days anyway.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.423
Then“.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.839
Why saved it...

54:35.840 --> 54:37.626
when it was ill?

54:40.640 --> 54:42.760
Because it can't be sold at a good price
if it's dead.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.666
Then what is different now?

54:45.840 --> 54:47.501
Not died of illness...

54:48.000 --> 54:49.604
but is starved to death.

54:58.320 --> 55:00.119
Turn around.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.621
Okay.

55:07.480 --> 55:09.027
And you all!

55:20.280 --> 55:21.542
Done.

55:26.120 --> 55:28.521
You like blood.

55:28.760 --> 55:29.999
So dangerous just then.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.342
What should we do?

55:31.760 --> 55:33.119
What should we do?

55:33.120 --> 55:34.746
You're the mother!

55:45.840 --> 55:48.844
I saw a baby coming out...

55:49.640 --> 55:51.881
from her mouth.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.921
A baby can be born from below...

55:56.440 --> 55:58.044
and also from above.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.804
Isn't that right, dear?

56:04.360 --> 56:06.044
What happened, honey? What happened?

56:12.040 --> 56:13.119
What happened?

56:13.120 --> 56:15.282
Do you have... some food?

56:39.480 --> 56:41.084
I told you before.

56:41.320 --> 56:42.845
A monster is a monster.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.580
Don't drink blood anymore.

57:05.720 --> 57:07.426
You must learn.

57:07.480 --> 57:08.742
Otherwise...

57:09.120 --> 57:11.009
people will say I didn't teach you well.

57:11.520 --> 57:12.987
Understand?

57:14.240 --> 57:15.719
Your daddy,

57:15.720 --> 57:17.722
he didn't learn well.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.679
That's why he's so dumb...

57:19.680 --> 57:21.545
and knows nothing!

57:25.440 --> 57:27.101
Your mommy,

57:27.320 --> 57:29.004
she didn't have a good education.

57:29.160 --> 57:30.946
That's why she is always rude.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.586
What did you say?

57:35.800 --> 57:36.879
From now on,

57:36.880 --> 57:38.239
you eat fruits and vegetables instead.

57:38.240 --> 57:39.821
You will learn to like it.

57:50.760 --> 57:52.546
Look at those poor horses.

57:52.680 --> 57:54.409
We shouldn't hurt them.

58:52.760 --> 58:54.500
You carry this all the time.

58:54.920 --> 58:56.660
From your lover?

58:59.000 --> 59:00.119
My father gave it to me...

59:00.120 --> 59:01.621
when I was twelve.

59:01.800 --> 59:03.119
He said whenever I'm scared,

59:03.120 --> 59:04.199
if I play it,

59:04.200 --> 59:05.861
he'll be there.

59:06.280 --> 59:07.667
Did you try?

59:09.880 --> 59:12.121
My father never taught me how to play it.

59:12.560 --> 59:14.324
That was the last time I saw him.

59:16.920 --> 59:18.182
So...

59:18.280 --> 59:19.940
have you ever looked for him?

59:20.120 --> 59:21.860
My father was a monster hunter.

59:21.960 --> 59:22.879
But he was killed...

59:22.880 --> 59:24.506
by a monster.

59:29.200 --> 59:30.826
When I was a child,

59:31.080 --> 59:32.866
my mother suddenly disappeared.

59:33.520 --> 59:35.431
Dad took me to Yongning Village...

59:36.000 --> 59:37.547
and left me there.

59:37.920 --> 59:39.319
He went away by himself.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.787
I don't want you.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.611
Go away. Go.

59:45.960 --> 59:48.167
So the villagers of Yongning Village...

59:48.840 --> 59:50.751
are like my family.

59:51.480 --> 59:53.050
Your father... He...

59:54.160 --> 59:55.799
Whoever leaves his son alone...

59:55.800 --> 59:57.540
isn't qualified to be a father.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.159
See,

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.439
all monsters are bad?

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.641
Even this little one will grow up
to be an evil monster.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.381
Let me teach you.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.641
"Not sure how we
end up hanging together..."

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.246
"and be at the right time to see the beauty
of the peach blossom."

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.646
"Seeing the blossoms fall makes me realize"

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.243
"how time flies."

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:52.527
"How can I describe this feeling?"

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.962
"it's almost like we can
complete each other."

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.244
"This connection exists
even when we are apart."

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:09.005
"it is wonderful when you feel
understood and comfortable."

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.406
"How can we stretch
the time we have together?"

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:29.410
"What is the secret behind
an everlasting relationship?"

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.407
"The falling petals look
amazing in the air."

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:39.008
"But this beautiful scenery
will soon be over."

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:45.930
"How to keep this bonding forever..."

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.688
"and not let it get rotten?"

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.004
"Today seems ordinary and not special."

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.765
"But one day when you look back,"

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.925
"today would seem unique and memorable."

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:10.680
"Can we come back to today
when we are in tomorrow?"

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.962
"Shuntian City"

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.439
Look! Isn't she very pretty today?

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.519
Absolutely!

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.067
Yes, yes, yes.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.581
Exactly what I want.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.261
Hold on. Pong!

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.740
I got it!

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.305
Your turn. Hurry up!

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.660
Fat choi!

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.307
Win!

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.128
How come you guys win again?

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.761
Five tiles of Fat Choi instead of four?

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.265
Show all your hands!

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.359
Sell them?

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.799
Hm!

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.222
Get out!

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.599
You want to do... some business?

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.942
No.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.003
You do look like a radish.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.421
50 taels.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.580
Let's go! Not for sale now.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.945
Just name a price.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.844
I know what it's worth.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.341
At least 100 taels.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.620
Put it in the cage.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.301
And wait here.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.582
Come on.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.947
You're rude.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.461
Let me.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.505
We haven't named you yet.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.702
Should we not sell it?

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.701
Hurry UP-

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.141
Turn around.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.119
Let's play hide and seek.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.621
I'll count to three,

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.119
I'll hide over there...

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.759
and you hide in the cage.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.919
Then she will look for us.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.307
Understand?

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.130
Let's start. One, two, three!

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.707
No,

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.399
you should hide in the cage...

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.867
like what I do.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.239
No,

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.210
when I count one, two, three...

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.319
Why are you so rude?

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.946
You want to keep it?

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.760
Yes. Even few more days would be good.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.799
Few more days?

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.720
The result is still the same
after few more days.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.519
Look, look,

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.862
it cries.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.159
Nonsense.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.159
It's a monster.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.781
What emotions could it have?

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.559
It keeps following us.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.300
Isn't that emotion?

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.250
You cut your fingers to feed it blood.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.599
Of course it'll follow you.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.799
You feed grass to cows and goats.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.879
They'd follow you too.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.530
What kind of emotion do you call that?

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.050
Who says cows and goats have no emotions?

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.322
Why do you think only humans have emotions?

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.359
Even if it doesn't have emotions,

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.702
I have.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.959
Stop now.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.359
Humans and monsters aren't meant
to be together.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.060
That's why you should sell it!

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.066
What is it?

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:17.742
Go!

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.821
A newbie in the industry?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.122
Do more trading...
and you'll get used to it.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:36.827
Go. Go.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:32.799
I know.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.665
We should name it Wuba.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.924
Can you play mahjo?g?

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.468
Let's

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.941
Where's our little monster?

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.639
Kill me if you can!

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.484
You will beg for our mercy!

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.428
Pong!

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.130
I'll tell you if you win.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.827
Your turn!

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.810
- Eight circles.
- Pong!

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.119
Wait! Can you slow down?

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.860
I'm not ready yet.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.300
Hurry UP-

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.479
What should I do?

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.867
Thirteen orphans?

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.239
Win!

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.599
- Win?
- Hm!

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.101
Fooling me?

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.839
Where's the little monster?

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.879
Heaven Restaurant.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.481
It may be getting ready to be butchered.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.999
Let's go!

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.684
Play another round with me.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.802
I still haven't told you the password.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.111
How can you get in?

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.962
"Heaven Restaurant."

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.519
Little guy,

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.799
where are you from?

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.719
How come you're not

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.119
wearing any skin?

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.065
No wonder you were caught!

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.279
Look at my skin,

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.799
so real and smooth!

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.599
Look at mine,

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.170
so elastic!

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.159
See,

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.519
it's seamless.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.519
Do this,

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.067
puff your cheeks!

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.759
Didn't I tell you to take off the skin?

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.319
No! We won't take it off!

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.679
We won't take it off!

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.102
Go!

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.199
- Head Chef!
- What the...

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:14.959
You guys are too much.

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.791
Scared the hell out of me!

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.290
Pay attention.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.359
The monsters we have today...

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.941
are SO awesome...

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.530
and delicious.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.341
What's happening?

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.879
What's the problem?

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.108
Head Chef.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.439
Head Chef,

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.039
we can't open this monster.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.399
Why won't you cooperate?

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.981
No way!

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.719
Listen.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.370
Every monster dies.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.039
Sooner or later,

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.639
it's just a matter of time.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.879
Open up, okay?

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.399
No way.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.559
You stubborn monster.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.141
You've asked for it.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.181
Fine.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.946
Don't cut my buttocks!

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.708
Marvelous.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.599
Monster sashimi,

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.862
All ready.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.169
No wonder she's our Head Chef.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.759
Stand still!

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.639
What's with these two monsters?

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.540
They refuse to take off their skin.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.359
Hey gorgerous,

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.879
you look stunning today.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.199
Your inner beauty is shining as well.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.986
Please. Let us go!

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.650
My goodness,

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.763
this kid has a sweet mouth.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.359
If you grow up,

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.522
You're gonna hurt a lot of innocent girls.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.759
It's better to take care of you now.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.599
Head Chef,

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.523
could you cook me

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.284
instead of serving me raw?

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.647
Oh, you poor thing.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.239
As you wish!

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.079
Then we should...

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.969
soak you in sauces before baking,

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.702
okay?

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.279
- Take them away!
- Yes.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.239
Go!

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.839
Head Chef,

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.649
make sure you don't undercook.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.039
No worries.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.399
I'll make you into...

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.528
my special recipe pot roast.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.610
My favorite.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.460
- Head Chef.
- Oh, my goodness.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.846
The little monster king
everyone's talking about!

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.489
I also have something special for you.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.870
- Deep fry!
- Yes.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.088
We can rescue our little king soon.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.119
Sir Zou and Lady Zou,

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.507
please come this way.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.039
Useless!

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.679
I told you to eat more.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.439
Why do you have to stay so thin?

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.226
Not even big enough to block me.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.508
Madam,

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.679
are you here for curing illness...

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.479
or boosting your health?

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.947
You go away.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.359
I'll use the restroom.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.827
You stay.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.342
Xiaoluo,

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.841
bring Huzi over here to show Madam.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.341
I'm afraid of dogs.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.561
You're human. Why would
you be afraid of dogs?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.525
I prefer cats.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.809
I don't like cats.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.879
Go! There's a cat over there.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.919
Go, go, go!

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.865
Sorry, go that way, that way.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.119
He doesn't recognize us.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.805
He didn't see us in human form.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.225
Right!

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.324
Hurry up! The door is closing.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.919
Password.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.439
- One, two, three?
- Wrong!

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.385
- Five, two, one?
- Wrong!

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.849
Password!

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.781
Stop hitting me. Stop hitting me.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.199
"Four,"

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.399
"three,"

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.742
"eight."

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.485
Our two honorable guests,

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.483
this way please.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.968
You are useless as well.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.962
I told you to eat less.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.044
You being so heavy really hurts.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.639
The first appetizer...

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.768
is monster ears in oil.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.570
First hang the monsters...

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.485
on the right and upside down
for three days and nights,

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.925
so that all the blood can
gather in one point.

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.959
Slice not too much, not too little,

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.860
just that corner of the right ears.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.247
Why don't you two eat?

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.700
I have to go to the restroom.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.626
Restroom, restroom.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.168
I thought we will have the
little monster king...

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.039
since we paid 300 taels more?

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.963
Today, you all are lucky!

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.727
Little monster king is a newly added dish.

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.884
We've been preparing it in the kitchen.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.809
Fantastic!

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.930
That's great.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.806
I also need to go to the restroom...

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.006
before we try the special dish.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.861
Excuse me.

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.901
Put it in the steamer.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.742
We are such a team.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.039
Open it.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.587
Yes!

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.786
Still alive?

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.727
It's not fair. I already tried my best.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.919
I want to go home.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.729
I want to see mommy!

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.919
Is my hair messy?

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.319
Your hair is perfect.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.039
Really?

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.439
Do I look pretty?

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.479
You're gorgeous!

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.101
Just need some moisturizing.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.741
Let's

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.260
We could only serve it this way.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:39.142
Xiaowu,

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.519
I'm sorry.

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.409
Xiaowu is in the kitchen!

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.319
Xiaowu.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.821
I know,

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.071
you will come!

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.679
Mayor,

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.863
watch out!

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.141
Duo Ian bu lu ye!

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.730
Run! Run!

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.319
I abandoned my friend once.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.106
I'll never do it again!

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.425
I can't beat that guy!

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:40.839
See you.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.626
You will get killed.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.999
You're a monster hunter.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.650
How come you help an outsider instead?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.467
He's not an outsider.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.826
He's my husband!

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.388
What?

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.119
Are you serious about

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.667
what you just said?

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.079
My dad said,

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.199
A man and a woman should keep a distance.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.145
If they kiss, they must marry.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.250
- Can we...
- Cannot, cannot.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.570
- But...
- No buts!

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.848
I am the only one left...
in the Huo family.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.159
The responsibility to expand my family...

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.279
and have children and grandchildren...

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.805
is now all yours.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.359
- Will it be too...
- No, it won't.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.999
We are running out of time.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.039
I know.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.399
I am under a lot of pressure too.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.925
We will do our best.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.866
Leave me alone.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.565
Xiaowu, take her away...

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:20.279
from my sight and leave.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.399
Take care,

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.039
and don't die.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.769
I'm not done arguing with you yet.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.502
Leave!

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.546
Mo he qie di!

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.507
Run!

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.105
Why does it keep chasing me?

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.479
Auntie Mo,

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.470
please set the other villagers free.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.302
Take care!

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.867
It's our little king!

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.741
Oh mama!

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.249
So glad to see you again.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.959
Master, we have
something important to do!

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.119
Please let us go.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.542
Impossible!

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.707
He'll get killed.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:33.964
Another monster hunter helps monsters.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.661
Is this food?

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.767
This is the main dish of the banquet:

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.971
Raw baby monster king's brain.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.159
This dish brings long life

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.686
and stops you from ageing.

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.403
It moves. Is it alive?

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.246
Eating it alive offers the most benefits.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.131
We feed it with wine and
make it half-drunk,

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:21.679
then open a hole...

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.439
on the top of its head.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.363
The best way to enjoy this dish is to...

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.684
simply eat its brain while it's fresh.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.999
Why are you here?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.581
You know her?

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.163
Is this a human... or a monster?

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.559
Want to find out?

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.479
Sure.

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.359
Grandma,

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.959
she just helped pulling you out.

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.586
Grandma?

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.119
Why are you here?

01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:58.959
Two villagers...

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.610
bought me here so I can look for my son.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.799
Who are you?

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.631
Tianyin.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:06.546
Who is she?

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.129
I'm your... granddaughter-in-law.

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.747
Grandma.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.244
Come this way.

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.279
Tianyin.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.839
Your dad...

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.569
left this sword for you.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.439
It has enormous power!

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:24.279
Let me tell you.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.719
It's best for chopping vegetables.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.142
You see...

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.159
It doesn't matter.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.439
After some sharpening,

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.408
it can chop monsters easily.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.239
Grandma, how do you sharpen it?

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.242
You use some kind of blood but...

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.986
anyway-

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.946
You see,

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.627
that guy over there...

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.490
Fine. Fine. Grandma, you stay put.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.119
Wait for me here!

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.587
See you later, Grandma!

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.666
This fire beetle,

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.839
is an expert in opening the skulls...

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.751
of monsters.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:58.719
And...

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.279
drinking the blood of
this little monster...

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.145
will bring amazing results.

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.061
Miss Huo!

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.231
Who dares to make trouble here?

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:55.941
Darling, let's go.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:00.839
You two leave first.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:01.839
I can't...

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.888
Leave. You can't help me here.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.182
Darling.

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.322
I thought you're someone more powerful.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.880
But you're just a mediocre level
two monster hunter.

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.804
Hold on!

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.465
Another one?

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.639
Level ten!

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.039
What does that mean?

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.691
Level ten is the top level
of monster hunters.

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.039
All these years,

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.327
only three persons have reached that level.

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.769
Excuse me, may I have your name?

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.444
My husband...

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:02.288
is the Head of former Monster Hunt Bureau
Song Zhenjiang.

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.119
My son...

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.886
is palace swordsman Song Daitian.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:11.126
My grandson Tianyin is...

01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:14.466
nobody.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.921
You let my granddaughter-in-law down first.

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.009
Didn't you say you're a level ten?

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.010
Why don't you save her yourself?

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.982
Fine!

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:39.809
Weng ba ya!

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.924
The coins are not yours!

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.884
Who says they aren't mine?

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.650
My husband had six,

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:49.839
my son had five.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.604
All together I have ten.

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.530
Six plus five is eleven!

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.346
It's ten!

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.391
Song Tianyin,

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.564
if you hand in the little monster,

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.311
I'll release them.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.945
If you don't show up,

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.850
I'll kill your grandma first...

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.039
and then your wife.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.849
Can you... can you switch the order?

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.199
Wife first...

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.747
and then grandma?

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.381
Good idea.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.345
Five,

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.346
four,

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.345
three,

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.545
two,

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.159
One.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.900
Hold on!

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.844
It's too late.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.759
Grandma or wife,

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.524
either one must die.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:45.105
You choose.

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.748
I've chosen!

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.821
No more tricks?

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.044
Lord Ge is... a monster?

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.959
He has so many layers of skin.

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:27.769
No wonder we couldn't tell he's a monster!

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.967
I put on the skin to disguise as human

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.684
in order to get rid
of the surviving supporters

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.922
of the old Monster King
in the human world.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.921
Now you've forced me to reveal myself.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.249
You all have to die!

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.867
Grandma!

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:20.980
Granddaughter-in-law,

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.519
Your father-in-law

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.363
left you this sword!

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.705
Best for chopping vegetables.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.787
Tianyin!

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.586
Tianyin!

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.786
Tianyin!

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.346
Song Tianyin,

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.164
Wake up!

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:24.369
My dad has left me already.

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.705
Please don't leave me alone.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.810
I order you to wake up now.

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.879
Otherwise I'll gouge out your eyes,

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.039
cut off your tongue,

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.168
pull out your tendons...
and tear off your skin.

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.690
You're my husband.

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.479
Without my permission,

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:40.164
you can't die.

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.785
Please.

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.879
Tianyin,

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.484
use the Song family special moves.

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.439
Monsters...

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.331
will soon conquer the human world.

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:40.741
Thank you.

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.346
Tianyin.

01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.483
You truly met your dad's expectations.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.067
He?

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.546
Tianyin.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.479
This first coin...

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.084
was left to you by your dad.

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:14.839
Others...

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:16.683
You will have to earn on your own.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.439
Six plus five

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.941
equals ten!

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.362
The extra one... is for me.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.239
Are you sure?

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.439
Once you take this coin,

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:31.271
you are a monster hunter.

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:34.119
Yes!

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:35.462
Good!

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.021
Don't go!

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.067
Grandma.

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.090
Come back!

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.450
Come back!

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.484
They ate our baby king already?

01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.951
We are too late.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.482
Follow them to a remote place...

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.145
to rebuild a Yongning Village.

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.039
You'll only be safe...

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.780
with them.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:45.204
I really want you to be with me.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.785
But that would only hurt you.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.768
Even if I dress you up as a human,

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.302
sooner or later,

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.887
people will find out.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.960
And that would be very dangerous for you.

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.129
Humans still can't accept you.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.267
Understand?

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.448
Don't let others call you a radish anymore.

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.449
Even though you do look like one.

01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:34.187
Remember,

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.045
you've got a name.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.661
It's Wuba.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.387
Go.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.547
Leave.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.101
Go away!

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.026
I don't want you!

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:13.748
Go!

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.546
I don't want you!

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:19.821
Don't follow me!

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.107
Just go.

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.866
Go!

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.439
You let a monster go.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.044
How can you be a monster hunter?

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.160
There are good monsters and bad monsters.

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.221
I only catch the bad ones.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.759
Come to think of it,

01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.330
you're my man now.

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.250
From now on just do what I tell you.

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.171
Where are we going?

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.100
I want to look for my dad.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.290
I would like to know more about him.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.783
Let's go.

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.746
Let me carry it.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.981
I'll carry.

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.682
I'm starving.

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.919
Waiter,

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.402
do you have any human meat or human liver?

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.639
It's just me here.

01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.119
How about

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:44.781
eating me first?

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.646
Where do you think... Wuba would live?

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.359
I don't know.

01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:57.885
Then how can we go to visit him?

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.921
His one month old party, his birthday,
mid-autumn festival,

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.000
new year and many, many other festivals...

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:12.089
"Life is a special book."

01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:18.327
"You have to read it with your heart."

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:21.851
"The beginning chapter can be confusing."

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.200
"But it will become clear and interesting
when you keep reading."

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:35.049
"Life is also a strange road."

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.802
"You have to keep going
even though it's bumpy."

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:44.605
"Once you stop relying on others,"

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:49.448
"then you will start to grow."

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.767
"I won't forget the caring and love..."

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:58.003
"from the ones who brought me up."

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.170
"I will remember all the laughs
and all the tears."

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:06.321
"The road is long and bright
in front of me."

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.529
"I am blessed to have you..."

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.685
"show me this road."

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.888
"Mi go ba,
someone good looking or a monster."

01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:00.802
"Nu go ba, we all should have fun."

01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:04.443
"Ta go ba, let's rock together."

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.565
"Right now, just listen to me."

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:10.569
"No bottom line. Qia qia."

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:12.444
"Unlimited. Pa pa."

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.962
"if you can turn into a durian
no one can hurt you."

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.970
"No bottom line. Qia qia."

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.004
"Unlimited. Pa pa."

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.567
"Relax and let yourself shine."

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.959
<i>“Ka chad.“</i>

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:27.089
"it doesn't matter whether you're
from Shangri-la."

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:30.963
"it is also fine if you have
or not have boundaries."

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.039
"You, you and you"

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.042
"can all enjoy the rhythm."

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:38.442
"I hug you, you, you,
you and you together."

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.524
"No bottom line. Qia qia."

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.599
