Wow, already drunk on power.

40:28.656 --> 40:31.824
Well, given that I wept on
Richard's answering machine

40:31.859 --> 40:33.759
tonight, I would like
to get drunk on something.

40:33.794 --> 40:35.828
- Can we start drinking?
- Well, you deleted it.

40:35.863 --> 40:38.564
To the three of us.

40:38.599 --> 40:39.698
I'm glad we're still working together.

40:39.734 --> 40:42.434
Me too.

40:42.470 --> 40:44.536
Now let's talk about
what's really important.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.572
Oh, yeah. Somebody at this table

40:46.607 --> 40:48.474
had the most liked story of the week.

40:48.509 --> 40:50.409
Oh, no, we are not doing this.

40:50.444 --> 40:53.645
Ohh, yes yes. We are doing this.
I'm reading it out loud.

40:53.681 --> 40:56.648
- Sutton. No.
- Sutton. Yes.

40:56.684 --> 41:00.319
"Every Booty Could Use a Butt Facial"
by Jane Sloan.

41:00.354 --> 41:02.788
- I will leave the table.
- You will not.

41:02.823 --> 41:05.390
"Whether you've heard it
for the first time today,

41:05.426 --> 41:06.792
or know a little thanks
to Sunday brunch chats..."

41:06.827 --> 41:08.460
[fades under music]

41:08.496 --> 41:10.529
<i>♪ This is our city ♪</i>

41:10.564 --> 41:12.498
<i>♪ This is our city ♪</i>

41:12.533 --> 41:14.566
[phone ringing]

41:14.602 --> 41:16.435
Hello?

41:16.470 --> 41:18.637
<i>Jane, it's Victoria from "Incite."</i>

41:18.672 --> 41:21.540
- Hi, how are you?
<i>- Good, thanks.</i>

41:21.575 --> 41:23.709
