WEBVTT

00:07.308 --> 00:08.976
Previously
on Star Trek: Discovery...

00:09.077 --> 00:11.612
We got you, Gray. We'll find
a way to help you be seen,

00:11.712 --> 00:13.013
-truly seen.
-I can't believe

00:13.114 --> 00:14.982
I get to start my life again.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.484
BURNHAM:
Book? You there?

00:16.584 --> 00:17.651
BOOK:
I keep seeing him.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.987
Leto. I don't know if he knew,

00:20.088 --> 00:22.490
if I ever let him know
how much I loved him.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.258
I'm sorry.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.328
I'm gonna figure this thing out
for you, whatever it takes.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.664
TILLY:
Starfleet Academy feels like
1,000 years ago.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.533
Nothing feels simple anymore.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.135
It's okay to feel that way.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.437
I don't know if something's off
or, uh, I'm off.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.173
I was kind of hoping that we
could talk about it sometime.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.508
VANCE:
What exactly is this anomaly?

00:40.608 --> 00:42.110
STAMETS:
We're not certain.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.011
We know it's there,
we know it's moving,

00:44.112 --> 00:45.379
but we can't get a handle

00:45.479 --> 00:46.780
on what it is.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.017
I offer the services
of the Ni'Var Science Institute.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.686
A crisis such as this
requires all to contribute.

00:52.786 --> 00:56.023
This anomaly
threatens us all equally.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.726
We must all work together.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.063
*

01:09.303 --> 01:11.205
This is Commander Fickett
of the USS Credence.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.241
We have
your dilithium shipment ready.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.409
WOMAN:
We are grateful to receive it,
Commander.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.245
It has been a long time.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.680
FICKETT:
Always happy to help.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.050
-Looking good.
-Everything is ready, Commander.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.286
-We have their coordinates.
-Good work.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.188
Thank you, Lieutenants.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.590
Computer,
lower the shields for transfer.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.225
Locking on your coordinates now.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.561
-COMPUTER: Security breach.
-(alarm blaring)

01:33.661 --> 01:36.630
(grunting and groaning)

01:42.736 --> 01:45.072
Commander!

01:48.242 --> 01:49.410
Stand down.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.011
(alarm continues blaring)

01:51.111 --> 01:52.646
I need to take your dilithium.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.482
You can wait your turn
like everybody else.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.751
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Please step aside.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.820
It's not gonna happen.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.258
No.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.129
(groans)

02:11.299 --> 02:16.170
Please, my friend,
choose to live.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.609
(yells)

02:27.481 --> 02:29.617
I'm sorry.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.024
VANCE:
Fourth and most recent

02:37.124 --> 02:40.494
in a string
of identical dilithium thefts.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.696
Killing a Starfleet officer,
though--

02:42.796 --> 02:45.032
that's new.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.302
The killer is a Ni'Var citizen

02:48.402 --> 02:51.572
and a Qowat Milat nun
known as J'Vini.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.307
Her cohorts are mercenaries

02:53.407 --> 02:56.043
confirmed to be operating
under her orders.

02:56.143 --> 03:00.614
Thanks to the tracker we planted
in the dilithium she stole,

03:00.714 --> 03:02.983
we now have her coordinates.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.485
You said these thefts began

03:04.585 --> 03:07.455
shortly after the gravitational
anomaly was discovered.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.523
Might there be a connection?

03:09.623 --> 03:12.092
As of now,
we have no indication of motive.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.228
J'Vini's crimes,
however, are clear.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.230
She must be detained
without delay.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.532
BURNHAM:
This would be
an appropriate time

03:18.632 --> 03:20.033
for the Qowat Milat to join us.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.303
Thank you, President T'Rina.

03:24.238 --> 03:29.510
RILLAK:
Admiral, Ni'Var is a trusted
ally of the Federation.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.579
Despite the fact
that these crimes

03:31.679 --> 03:33.447
were committed
on Starfleet vessels,

03:33.547 --> 03:37.585
we will not respond
without Ni'Var's guidance.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.353
Thank you.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.154
Indeed, we are more than allies.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.056
It is my hope that
we will soon be united

03:43.156 --> 03:44.658
under the flag
of the Federation.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.628
The dangers posed by the anomaly
make our cooperation

03:47.728 --> 03:50.163
all the more important.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.533
It is my understanding that,

03:52.633 --> 03:55.135
at the moment, no inhabited
systems are threatened

03:55.235 --> 03:58.005
by its trajectory, yet it
could change course at any time.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.707
That is the case,
Madam President.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.342
Commander Stamets
has been leading the efforts

04:01.442 --> 04:03.010
to better understand
its movements.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.578
He's eager
to start collaborating

04:04.678 --> 04:06.213
with the Ni'Var
Science Institute.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.715
And they are ready
to receive him.

04:07.815 --> 04:12.052
Here, too,
we offer our services.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.688
This is an internal
Qowat Milat matter,

04:14.788 --> 04:16.290
and as such, we ask

04:16.390 --> 04:19.226
that Starfleet turn
her coordinates over to us.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.961
We believe J'Vini
most likely is acting

04:21.061 --> 04:24.432
as a galankhkan
on behalf of a lost cause.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.300
VANCE:
"Most likely"?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.135
You have doubts?

04:28.235 --> 04:29.537
No.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.572
I have faith.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.273
Why would she steal
the dilithium?

04:33.374 --> 04:35.108
The Federation
is giving it away.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.144
I don't know.
This is the first news

04:37.244 --> 04:39.146
we've heard of J'Vini
in several years.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.048
But I trust she has a reason.

04:41.148 --> 04:44.217
The order must be allowed
to discover that context.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.719
Mom.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.288
She killed a Starfleet officer.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.024
You cannot excuse that
with context.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.394
We do not excuse
J'Vini's actions.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.096
However, we must be the ones
to pursue her.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.765
I fear no one but her sisters

04:57.865 --> 04:59.667
will be able
to bring her in alive.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.669
The unique ways
of the Qowat Milat

05:01.769 --> 05:04.137
must be respected.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.408
RILLAK:
Admiral Vance,

05:07.508 --> 05:11.311
would Starfleet be amenable
to making this a joint mission?

05:11.412 --> 05:16.149
A venture of mutual goodwill
would reflect the spirit

05:16.249 --> 05:20.287
of the pending union between
Ni'Var and the Federation.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.223
Under the circumstances,

05:23.323 --> 05:26.994
we would, of course,
be amenable.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.030
As would the Qowat Milat.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.566
Well, might I suggest
Captain Burnham

05:32.666 --> 05:34.635
be permitted
to represent Starfleet?

05:34.735 --> 05:37.037
She has my confidence.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.007
And, dare I say,
the confidence of her mother.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.978
Whatever J'Vini's circumstances,
I think we can all agree

05:45.078 --> 05:48.115
that these actions
cannot be allowed to continue.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.084
Bring her in.

05:51.184 --> 05:51.985
Safely.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.354
I'll prepare to leave
immediately.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.624
As will I.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.566
Captain.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.201
If we may speak frankly?

06:08.301 --> 06:09.937
Of course.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.040
This joint mission is
a political necessity.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.610
Ni'Var and the Qowat Milat
must feel respected,

06:16.710 --> 06:20.313
but make no mistake--
you are in charge.

06:20.414 --> 06:23.150
I thought we landed
on "mutual goodwill" back there.

06:23.250 --> 06:27.087
Goodwill and leadership are
two different things.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.288
This anomaly,

06:28.388 --> 06:31.358
it is the biggest threat
we have faced since the Burn.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.227
This is our moment to serve

06:34.327 --> 06:37.064
and to show why restoring
the Federation is so critical.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.199
We cannot do that
without Ni'Var.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.502
But we also can't do it
if those who attack us

06:41.602 --> 06:43.403
don't see our strength.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.640
J'Vini must be brought in.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.442
Absolutely.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.978
If you feel your relationship
with your mother will make this

06:51.078 --> 06:53.046
-too difficult...
-No.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.684
No. J'Vini took the life
of a Starfleet officer.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.987
I will bring her to justice.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.289
I promise you that.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.993
Good. I'm counting on you.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.702
*

07:42.262 --> 07:44.297
*

08:12.325 --> 08:15.195
*

08:29.577 --> 08:32.312
(original Star Trek theme
plays)

08:44.124 --> 08:44.958
(gasps)

08:45.058 --> 08:46.393
No, you're almost finished.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.696
I was gonna ask you a question
if you have a second.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.130
For you, always.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.500
Oh, thanks.
I really appreciate it.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.703
So, um...

08:56.637 --> 08:58.338
(Tilly groans)

09:00.507 --> 09:02.409
That was...

09:02.509 --> 09:05.045
disturbingly not delicious.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.180
Is something amiss
with the replicator?

09:07.280 --> 09:08.916
No, no. I, um--

09:09.016 --> 09:10.483
sorry-- ordered mac and cheese
on purpose.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.052
And there's something amiss
with me,

09:12.152 --> 09:15.422
and Dr. Culber's trying
to help me with it.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.324
Well, while your dislike
of cheese

09:17.424 --> 09:19.960
certainly renders you a rarity
among humans,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.295
I was not aware
it was considered an actual...

09:22.395 --> 09:23.597
disorder.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.466
Oh, no, no, it's not.
Uh, um, I'm sorry.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.335
I am trying new things,

09:28.435 --> 09:31.605
because my comfort zone
has become uncomfortable.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.041
Or... too comfortable.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.175
Unclear.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.944
Anyway,
Dr. Culber thought it might help

09:37.044 --> 09:38.946
if I shake things up a little,
so last night,

09:39.046 --> 09:41.481
I slept with my pillow
at the other end of my bed,

09:41.581 --> 09:45.252
and then I took the long way
to the bridge this morning,

09:45.352 --> 09:47.955
and I was hoping I could, uh,
try out a little gardening

09:48.055 --> 09:50.057
by watering some of your plants.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.193
What is it you hope to gain
from novelty?

09:54.061 --> 09:56.664
To be honest, I'm not sure yet.

09:56.764 --> 10:00.968
I do keep thinking about
those cadets at the academy

10:01.068 --> 10:03.236
and just... how certain they are

10:03.336 --> 10:05.538
that they are exactly
where they're supposed to be.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.007
You know?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.309
And I used to have that.

10:10.343 --> 10:14.247
Clarity of purpose
can be difficult to achieve.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.549
Sorry. I know
you-you have some places to go.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.018
It's not important.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.087
I confess
to having dined quickly.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.989
I am speaking with Kaminar soon.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.658
Oh. Well, give Su'Kal my best.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.426
Oh. He would appreciate that.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.596
However, today's call is
with the local council

10:29.697 --> 10:31.198
to discuss our role

10:31.298 --> 10:34.467
in retrofitting
Kaminar's spaceport.

10:35.335 --> 10:39.372
My homeworld recently voted
to return to the stars.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.778
I will look for something
meaningfully unusual

10:44.878 --> 10:46.346
for you to do.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.082
Till then, you are welcome
to mist my plants.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.551
Oh, but do take care
to not touch the swampkelp

10:51.651 --> 10:53.420
while it is in bloom.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.355
Why? What happens if I do?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.225
It is better if you do not know.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.046
Hey.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.647
Thought I'd find you here.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.182
Stamets give you another job?

11:22.282 --> 11:24.617
Yeah. It's more like
a tachyon treasure hunt.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.619
-(chuckles)
-Not exactly in my wheelhouse,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.621
but it keeps me close
to the action.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.557
Such as it is.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.394
Speaking of action, mind
if I requisition your ship?

11:34.494 --> 11:36.263
Starfleet and Qowat Milat only.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.431
Yeah. I see how it is.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.134
Love a man up
and leave him without a ship.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.603
I will return it
washed and waxed.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.405
And I thank you.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.743
How is he?

11:49.843 --> 11:52.045
He's got a new theory.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.647
Primordial wormhole.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.523
Primordial wormhole, huh?

12:03.623 --> 12:06.393
Four out of five factors
point to yes.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.195
Um, one:

12:08.295 --> 12:10.397
Gravitational distortions
are consistent

12:10.497 --> 12:12.065
-with wormhole behavior.
-Mm-hmm.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.268
Two: So is the shape
of the gravitational well.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.171
Three: Its ability
to change direction.

12:18.271 --> 12:23.176
Four: It contains a massive
amount of accreted dark matter.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.544
Which reminds me,

12:24.644 --> 12:27.380
I've given it a nickname:
the DMA.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.681
Dark Matter Anomaly.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.118
Too much of a mouthful
to say every time.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.085
Right.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.088
Everything points
to a primordial wormhole

12:35.188 --> 12:37.090
except one missing factor.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.126
Let me guess: tachyons.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.394
Always present
at the birth of a wormhole.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.263
Without evidence of tachyons...

12:43.363 --> 12:44.664
We're back to square one.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.733
The evidence is in here.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.701
I just have to find it.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.504
Until I know what the DMA is,

12:51.604 --> 12:54.074
I can't predict its behavior.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.810
And we can't prevent another...

12:58.645 --> 13:01.248
The Ni'Var Science Institute
will be a great help.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.953
I'm, uh,
sending the raw data now.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.055
Okay. Keep me posted.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.494
I want to go to
the Science Institute with you.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.695
Oh, uh...

13:15.795 --> 13:18.465
no, no, no, you really wouldn't.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.967
It's gonna be so boring.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.002
Field equations. Manifolds.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.670
Torsion tensors.
Math, math, math.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.672
I need to be doing something.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.441
(sighs):
Helping. Come on.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.677
I, um...

13:32.846 --> 13:35.983
I can't bring these scientists
up to speed

13:36.083 --> 13:40.287
without a clinical
forensic discussion

13:40.387 --> 13:43.256
of your loss.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.625
I can handle it.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.631
Thank you.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.416
(exhales sharply)
It's me.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.985
Almost.

14:12.085 --> 14:16.489
I'll finally be a part
of the world again.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.592
No more looking in
from the outside,

14:19.692 --> 14:22.362
feeling invisible.

14:22.462 --> 14:27.400
The world has no idea
what it's been missing.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.205
The crew's gonna love you.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.574
I mean, not as much as I do,
obviously.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.243
(laughs)

14:37.077 --> 14:39.279
Thank Dr. Culber for me again?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.315
Wait a few minutes
and thank him yourself.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.516
In person.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.252
MAN:
Dr. Culber,

14:45.352 --> 14:47.687
Guardian Xi is arriving.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.397
Guardian Xi, welcome.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.632
I believe I've prepared
everything you need

14:59.732 --> 15:01.368
for the incorporation.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.938
An atypical arrangement...

15:05.038 --> 15:09.609
as befits zhian'tara
unlike any other.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.045
Adira Tal, greetings.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.680
ADIRA:
Thank you so much

15:13.780 --> 15:15.315
for doing this.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.616
It is my joy to assist.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.019
Do we have Gray Tal?

15:19.119 --> 15:22.622
(laughs):
Oh, uh, he's right here.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.424
Greetings.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.094
Um, tell him that, um...

15:27.194 --> 15:30.663
I'm honored
by his presence, and...

15:30.763 --> 15:33.400
I couldn't be more grateful
for his help.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.635
(laughs):
He's-he's really grateful
you're here.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.038
Guardians are kind of like
his heroes.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.340
He was on his way
to becoming one of you

15:40.440 --> 15:42.742
before things went sideways.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.979
It is my hope
that our work today

15:46.079 --> 15:48.648
will allow you
to resume your training.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.618
However, your unique situation

15:51.718 --> 15:55.422
is attended
by unpredictable dangers.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.025
I cannot guarantee
that your consciousness

15:58.125 --> 16:02.062
can find a new home
in a synthetic body

16:02.162 --> 16:06.066
without a host's mind
to guide you in.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.635
We must accept the possibility

16:08.735 --> 16:11.704
that you could be lost.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.507
Tell him that...

16:14.607 --> 16:16.976
I'm lost without this.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.279
I... I've been living
in an in-between place

16:19.379 --> 16:21.248
for too long already.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.383
I have to try.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.387
He understands the risks.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.589
He's good to go.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.259
Do we have the consent of Tal?

16:33.260 --> 16:34.361
We do.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.596
Then let us begin.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.370
SARU:
It sounds difficult.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.140
Uh-huh. My mother is bringing
a Qowat Milat sister with her.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.143
I should add a tactical officer
to balance the numbers.

16:50.243 --> 16:54.247
Can't have the mission
appear to favor either party.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.748
This mission
would be straightforward

16:55.848 --> 16:57.684
if it weren't for the politics.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.686
Don't get me started on Rillak.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.054
Mm, I will not.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.323
But I would like to offer a...

17:03.423 --> 17:05.625
a recommendation
for your tactical addition.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.394
Lieutenant Tilly.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.230
She has a long
and impressive list of skills,

17:10.330 --> 17:14.067
but combat falls
kind of at the bottom.

17:14.167 --> 17:18.338
That may be so, but Dr. Burnham
and her Qowat Milat companion

17:18.438 --> 17:20.273
are certain
to be highly combat trained,

17:20.373 --> 17:21.974
as are you.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.511
Given the delicate nature
of politics,

17:24.611 --> 17:26.179
you might consider making use

17:26.279 --> 17:29.216
of Tilly's
intuitive diplomatic skills.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.584
She does have a way
of putting people at ease.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.454
I believe she may do
the mission good.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.456
And it, her.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.024
Hmm.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.362
TILLY:
But it can be a little hard
to get out of your comfort zone

17:42.462 --> 17:43.996
when you can barely get out

17:44.097 --> 17:45.365
of the lab, you know?

17:45.465 --> 17:47.634
So getting the opportunity
to do this, this...

17:47.734 --> 17:49.469
this could be really good
for me.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.972
Um, I'm so sorry.
Not that, um...

17:53.072 --> 17:55.108
not that it's good that
your sister is getting arrested.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.444
Obvi... Obviously, that's not...

17:57.544 --> 17:58.978
that's not good.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.448
That's-that's bad.
That's not good at all.

18:01.548 --> 18:05.652
You worry that I'm dismayed
by your enthusiasm.

18:06.453 --> 18:09.055
I'm not.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.461
Absolute candor.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.163
I dig that.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.333
GABRIELLE:
You told me that when Spock
was accused of murder,

18:20.433 --> 18:21.934
you didn't believe it.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.337
And your trust in your brother
was justified.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.373
That's different. I knew him.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.241
And I know her.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.243
Who is she to you?

18:31.744 --> 18:34.281
I need to know
who I'm dealing with.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.083
(takes deep breath)

18:37.184 --> 18:39.619
When I first came
to this future,

18:39.719 --> 18:42.054
I was broken.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.325
A Qowat Milat sister
nursed me back, unwavering,

18:45.425 --> 18:46.526
for more than a year.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.328
Yes, you've told me.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.364
That sister was J'Vini.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.366
I was once her lost cause.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.968
She gave everything to heal me.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.738
I owe her everything.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.275
COMPUTER:
Approaching destination.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.680
You need to leave your phasers
on board.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.550
They are not
the Qowat Milat way.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.052
We are not Qowat Milat.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.054
And they'll be set to stun.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.457
If you go in there with phasers,
I'll never get through to her.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.493
You want to put us in front of
a member of your order unarmed?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.462
That's not gonna happen.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.097
Did I say unarmed?

19:28.134 --> 19:29.669
We'll be at a huge disadvantage.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.339
It was agreed that
the ways of the Qowat Milat

19:32.439 --> 19:34.307
would be respected.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.317
(snickers)

19:45.652 --> 19:48.955
This is
so outside my comfort zone.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.690
It's heavier than I expected.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.191
-Shwee! Oh.
-(sword clatters)

19:52.292 --> 19:53.593
Sorry. So sorry.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.729
I moisturized my hands
this morning. Apologies.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.665
But don't worry,
I'll be good to go.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.333
BURNHAM:
Good, because...

20:00.433 --> 20:02.168
we're here.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.486
TILLY:
I'm not reading any life signs
on the surface.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.421
Check under the surface.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.423
She has to be someplace
around here.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.725
TILLY:
One inhospitable,
uninhabited chunk of rock

20:25.825 --> 20:28.395
makes as good a hideout
as any other, so...

20:28.495 --> 20:30.263
why this one?

20:30.363 --> 20:33.366
Mom, did J'Vini have ties
to a person or place nearby?

20:33.466 --> 20:36.235
If she did, she chose not
to share it with her sisters.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.272
You were right-- there's
a cavity directly beneath us.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.140
-Atmosphere?
-It's breathable.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.576
And I'm getting a faint reading
from the dilithium tracker

20:43.676 --> 20:45.512
down there as well.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.514
COMPUTER:
Warning. Intruder alert.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.386
(grunting and groaning)

21:08.735 --> 21:10.370
(groans)

21:31.290 --> 21:34.260
(shuddering breaths)

21:34.361 --> 21:36.262
Mom.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.632
J'Vini.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.508
J'VINI:
I didn't want more blood
to be spilled.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.510
That can stop right now.

21:50.610 --> 21:54.146
Choose to live
by leaving immediately.

21:54.246 --> 21:57.450
Come after me,
your lives are forfeit.

22:00.453 --> 22:03.089
We're totally gonna ignore
that warning, aren't we?

22:03.189 --> 22:04.691
Mm-hmm.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.225
Let's move.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.528
TILLY (quietly):
Okay.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.632
ADIRA:
This isn't supposed
to be happening.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.200
I can't see him anymore.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.235
I can't feel him with me.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.571
The unjoining was a success.

22:19.639 --> 22:23.042
However, I do not yet
sense his presence

22:23.142 --> 22:25.344
in the synthetic body.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.482
Hey. Gray?

22:30.483 --> 22:32.685
GUARDIAN XI:
We must have patience.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.455
The process can take time.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.525
Please, keep me apprised.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.192
Thank you.

22:42.562 --> 22:45.031
Um, this-this can't...
this can't be it.

22:45.131 --> 22:48.134
We're supposed to just sit here
and-and do nothing?

22:48.234 --> 22:50.269
Well,
it's like Guardian Xi said.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.639
It could take some time.

22:56.242 --> 22:59.479
It's him, but it's not...

22:59.579 --> 23:03.149
it's not him, and I don't really
know what to do with that.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.218
Let's go for a walk.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.455
Dr. Pollard will be here.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.658
Gray's monitors will alert us
to even the slightest change.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.560
Come on.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.176
(sighs)

23:35.314 --> 23:37.984
TILLY:
Lost cause or lost civilization?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.386
This feels like a mausoleum.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.391
The degree of desiccation
suggests these pods

23:45.492 --> 23:47.126
are several centuries old.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.361
Possibly older.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.464
Why would J'Vini bring dilithium
to a crypt?

23:51.564 --> 23:53.032
I have no idea.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.067
As your lieutenant suggested,

23:55.167 --> 23:58.671
maybe she's simply utilizing
this moon as a safe house.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.072
Hey, check it out.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.541
Grave robbers?

24:03.042 --> 24:04.944
BURNHAM:
Yeah.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.212
But...

24:06.312 --> 24:09.148
why would a grave robber
bother doing this?

24:09.248 --> 24:11.050
J'Vini's cloak.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.460
I've never seen
a species like it.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.600
The database says unknown.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.969
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say that we found

24:30.069 --> 24:31.604
her lost cause.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.005
Unlikely.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.507
If J'Vini had pledged
her sword to it,

24:34.607 --> 24:36.643
her oath would have ended
with its demise.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.512
How are you so sure that
there's an oath here at all?

24:39.612 --> 24:41.981
I mean, you believe that she's
operating from a place of honor?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.584
Her mercenaries just killed
one of her own sisters.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.753
She'd only draw against us
if she believed

24:46.853 --> 24:48.555
we pose a threat to her cause.

24:48.655 --> 24:51.257
No, Mom, she's not
above the law.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.025
The reasons matter.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.661
I thought you'd understand that.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.428
Is that why you agreed
to a joint mission?

24:56.529 --> 24:58.264
Because you believe I'd give her
the benefit of the doubt?

24:58.364 --> 25:00.132
TILLY:
Hey, I just had a thought.

25:00.232 --> 25:03.936
(clears throat)
My mom and I didn't really
get along very well.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.404
She didn't really like children,

25:05.504 --> 25:09.141
um, touching her or, like,
needing things from her

25:09.241 --> 25:11.177
or actually generally
being around her.

25:11.277 --> 25:14.213
Um, but if she was here
right now, I would just...

25:14.313 --> 25:17.249
I would give her
the biggest hug.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.053
-(rumbling)
-Oh!

25:22.054 --> 25:23.422
-Seismic activity?
-No.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.424
Controlled
matter-and-antimatter reactions.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.326
The dilithium's been activated.

25:27.426 --> 25:31.631
This isn't a moon. It's a ship.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.633
And J'Vini just powered it up.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.202
Where's the dilithium?

25:36.302 --> 25:38.137
TILLY:
Tracker says it's...

25:43.342 --> 25:45.377
...right above our heads.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.014
There should be a way up there.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.449
GABRIELLE:
Fan out. Search the chamber.

25:54.687 --> 25:57.489
Or we could just take
the turbolift.

26:01.794 --> 26:02.929
(click)

26:03.029 --> 26:05.197
(whirring)

26:13.505 --> 26:15.541
STAMETS:
Given the nonlinear behavior

26:15.642 --> 26:18.310
and topological structure
of the DMA,

26:18.410 --> 26:22.448
it appears that any planet
within 12 A.U.

26:22.548 --> 26:26.018
of the ergosphere,
as Kwejian was,

26:26.118 --> 26:27.553
will sustain
gravitational shearing,

26:27.654 --> 26:31.223
resulting
in catastrophic instabilities.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.426
A primordial wormhole accounts
for this shear,

26:34.526 --> 26:35.662
but so far...

26:35.762 --> 26:39.165
Your theory and its challenges
are clear to us.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.300
Fantastic.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.236
Given time, I would
work this out myself, but...

26:44.336 --> 26:47.339
time is of the essence,
so here we are.

26:48.607 --> 26:54.046
Um, uh, c-could we discuss
the schedule for the day?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.515
Science first, nap later?

26:56.615 --> 26:59.518
Uh, I need all brains
on deck here.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.188
Our scientists often work
in a deep meditative state

27:02.288 --> 27:04.556
to sharpen their focus
and concentration.

27:04.657 --> 27:07.226
Oh, well, I'll, um...

27:07.326 --> 27:11.297
wait over there, then,
in my own sharp state.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.939
Mr. Booker.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.508
May I offer you a warm redspice?

27:22.608 --> 27:25.011
Many find it to be soothing
when experiencing

27:25.111 --> 27:26.713
emotional distress.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.081
That obvious?

27:29.181 --> 27:32.151
Your grief is to be expected.

27:33.219 --> 27:36.723
But your body language
also expresses guilt.

27:37.556 --> 27:40.126
Illogical, as the cause of
your loss was a force of nature,

27:40.226 --> 27:42.361
and as such, not your fault.

27:42.461 --> 27:45.631
I wasn't aware Vulcans were
so emotionally attuned.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.300
A common misconception.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.705
Vulcans experience emotions,
some quite strongly.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.506
We simply choose
to suppress them

27:54.606 --> 27:56.675
in favor
of a more logical approach.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.979
(chuckles):
Care to give me a few pointers
on that approach?

28:00.079 --> 28:04.450
The discipline of the arie'mnu
requires a lifetime to master.

28:04.550 --> 28:08.254
For the uninitiated, respite
would be fleeting at best.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.657
A drowning man only needs
one breath.

28:12.658 --> 28:16.128
I believe you require
a different set of tools

28:16.228 --> 28:19.031
than I can offer, Mr. Booker.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.333
As a Kwejian,

28:21.433 --> 28:25.471
emotion is as essential to you
as air and blood,

28:25.571 --> 28:28.374
rendering the suppression
of guilt inadequate.

28:28.474 --> 28:33.479
What you require
is freedom from guilt.

28:34.646 --> 28:37.583
There must have been a sign
it was coming.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.120
I missed it.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.257
If I hadn't,
I could have saved my family.

28:48.761 --> 28:51.263
That is not illogical.

28:54.700 --> 28:57.703
TILLY:
It is a truly bizarre
reaction system.

28:57.804 --> 29:01.240
Uh, the controls must be housed
somewhere else on the moon.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.342
Dilithium should be...

29:03.442 --> 29:05.011
Hmm.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.147
Bingo.

29:09.015 --> 29:12.084
Hello, little tracker.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.220
Can you power the ship down
from here?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.088
I think so, but J'Vini
will definitely know

29:16.188 --> 29:17.456
it's been sabotaged.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.558
Just see what you can do.

29:26.298 --> 29:29.101
BURNHAM:
This shows a supernova.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.203
A moon leaving its world.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.205
That's the ship we're on.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.307
Their own planet
became unlivable.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.177
And that's no mausoleum
out there.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.482
BURNHAM (gasps):
Cryostasis?

29:43.582 --> 29:46.618
The species in the cocoons
are alive.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.720
Now we've found her cause.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.958
She's protecting them
from grave robbers.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.192
Got it.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.461
-(whirring, clacking)
-Great work.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.029
What now?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.965
Now...

29:59.065 --> 30:01.567
I need you to, uh, stay here.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.670
As bait.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.575
ADIRA:
It was a mistake.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.678
Should have never
let Gray do it.

30:12.778 --> 30:15.647
He'd be here. He'd be safe.

30:16.849 --> 30:19.318
The choice wasn't yours.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.222
Yeah,
but what if he's really gone?

30:23.322 --> 30:26.658
And please don't tell me
he'll always be here in my heart

30:26.758 --> 30:28.560
or my memories or whatever.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.696
It's not the same.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.233
-No, it's not.
-(sighs)

30:34.333 --> 30:36.268
But I'll tell you
you're not alone.

30:36.368 --> 30:39.405
We're all here for you, Adira.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.407
You may find that connecting
with someone

30:41.507 --> 30:44.676
can be a guiding light
when things get dark.

30:50.649 --> 30:54.320
SARU:
I presume Gray remains in limbo?

30:54.420 --> 30:57.056
It could last indefinitely.

30:57.156 --> 31:00.059
I think the uncertainty might be
the hardest part for them.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.228
It is a challenging time
for us all.

31:02.328 --> 31:05.631
Of late, I am often reminded
of a Kelpien adage:

31:05.731 --> 31:08.367
It is difficult
to ride two valebeasts

31:08.467 --> 31:11.103
with only one set of buttocks.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.205
(laughing)

31:13.305 --> 31:15.074
Try riding three of them.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.743
You are doing a tremendous job,
Doctor.

31:17.843 --> 31:20.479
Uh, with both jobs.

31:20.579 --> 31:25.217
Serving as medical officer and
ship's counselor cannot be easy.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.020
Well, that's why I'm here--
to help.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.222
Or at least try.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.658
Sometimes the most important
thing we can do

31:32.758 --> 31:35.361
is reach for one another.

31:46.172 --> 31:48.107
(sighs)

31:53.212 --> 31:56.015
It's weird not feeling you,

31:56.115 --> 31:59.451
not even knowing where you are.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.622
I keep thinking you're just...

32:03.722 --> 32:05.457
all alone.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.526
Lost, maybe.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.567
Um...

32:15.667 --> 32:20.106
Dr. Culber said
this thing about...

32:20.206 --> 32:22.141
connecting with people, uh,

32:22.241 --> 32:25.311
being like a light in the dark.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.979
So...

32:27.079 --> 32:31.750
I figured maybe if you
can't find your way, that...

32:31.850 --> 32:35.221
I could be the one to guide you.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.659
So I'm here,

32:40.759 --> 32:43.996
reaching, and...

32:44.096 --> 32:47.366
I'll be here
until you come back.

32:50.636 --> 32:51.670
So...

32:51.770 --> 32:54.206
so please come back.

32:55.107 --> 32:57.309
*

33:03.649 --> 33:06.318
Sit here and be bait.

33:07.319 --> 33:11.057
(laughs):
I'm way outside
my comfort zone now.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.226
J'VINI:
Move away from the engine.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.994
-Now.
-I choose...

33:16.095 --> 33:17.963
I choose to live.
100%, I choose to live.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.398
Absolutely.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.168
Michael?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.975
You should have left, Gabrielle.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.310
I'm here to help you.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.245
I just need to understand...

33:34.346 --> 33:36.515
-TILLY: Captain?
-GABRIELLE: No, Michael.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.384
I've got this.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.472
Please.
You don't have to do this.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.675
BURNHAM:
J'Vini, let her go.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.112
You, get my warp drive
back online.

34:06.212 --> 34:09.981
I know coming with us would mean
that you abandoned your cause.

34:10.082 --> 34:12.984
What if you don't have
to abandon it?

34:13.085 --> 34:15.087
I know you don't want
to kill her.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.524
And I think we can offer you
a solution.

34:18.624 --> 34:21.193
You would say whatever you have
to, to get me to drop my guard.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.661
BURNHAM:
No.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.364
No. No lies, I promise you.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.965
We have a few minutes

34:27.065 --> 34:28.434
while Lieutenant Tilly repairs
the systems.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.736
Oh, yeah. At least.
I mean, I'm-I'm hurrying,

34:30.836 --> 34:33.272
but I-I really did a number
on this thing, so...

34:33.372 --> 34:36.275
BURNHAM:
The species sleeping
in the cocoons,

34:36.375 --> 34:39.145
they're your lost cause,
aren't they?

34:39.245 --> 34:42.148
You can trust her, J'Vini.
She's my daughter.

34:45.351 --> 34:48.220
They're Abronians,
the last of their kind.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.157
Their biomatter has
high concentrations of latinum.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.058
It's what
the grave robbers wanted.

34:53.159 --> 34:56.162
And the Abronian who wears
your cloak was special to you?

34:56.262 --> 34:57.696
Taglonen.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.698
I didn't know him.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.600
That doesn't matter.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.337
Going as fast as I can.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.576
I was traveling
through the star system.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.412
Suddenly, I felt...

35:13.512 --> 35:15.381
love...

35:15.481 --> 35:18.284
community, family...

35:18.384 --> 35:20.619
and suffering.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.654
It was as if someone
was calling out to me,

35:22.754 --> 35:24.723
begging me for help.

35:24.823 --> 35:28.194
The telepathic distress signal
was from Taglonen?

35:28.294 --> 35:31.062
There was no one else in range.

35:31.163 --> 35:34.233
-These people were under attack.
-(grunting, swords clanging)

35:46.278 --> 35:49.248
I needed to protect
the rest of them.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.453
I accepted his cause as my own.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.557
This was not the path
I expected,

35:58.657 --> 36:00.226
but this is where I'm needed.

36:00.326 --> 36:03.262
I promised that
as long as I was breathing,

36:03.362 --> 36:05.364
no further harm
would come to them.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.966
The carvings on the wall suggest
the Abronians traveled here

36:08.066 --> 36:09.968
while in cryosleep,

36:10.068 --> 36:11.169
and this planet
that we're orbiting

36:11.270 --> 36:12.971
was meant to be their new home.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.707
And when they wake,
I will make sure they claim it.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.377
-The dilithium was necessary.
-Why?

36:18.477 --> 36:21.447
If they were supposed
to be here, why move them?

36:21.547 --> 36:25.217
You know about the gravitational
anomaly near this sector?

36:25.317 --> 36:26.718
Yes, we do.

36:26.818 --> 36:29.255
Without the dilithium,
I wouldn't have been able

36:29.355 --> 36:31.990
to move the Abronians to safety
if it had come this way.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.393
If you had asked, we would
have given you the dilithium.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.262
I did ask.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.064
Starfleet doesn't dispense
dilithium to individuals.

36:39.164 --> 36:41.467
They would have wanted the name
and location of the species

36:41.567 --> 36:43.168
J'Vini was representing.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.036
BURNHAM:
And you couldn't risk
the Abronians' safety

36:45.136 --> 36:48.740
by asking on their behalf
and revealing their existence.

36:48.840 --> 36:52.378
Killing your officer
was never my plan.

36:52.478 --> 36:55.281
But his death was not in vain.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.549
I believe that the Abronians
were meant to wake

36:57.649 --> 36:59.285
a long time ago.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.253
And there's no logical reason
why they would have remained

37:01.353 --> 37:03.088
in cryostasis
after their arrival,

37:03.188 --> 37:05.357
so I have to conclude that
there was some kind of failure

37:05.457 --> 37:07.225
in the cryo system.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.994
So...

37:09.094 --> 37:13.565
if we fix the problem
and help them wake...

37:13.665 --> 37:16.735
won't your oath be fulfilled?

37:18.804 --> 37:22.007
You have until she finishes.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.430
Uh, hi.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.231
Are you done?

37:46.332 --> 37:47.198
We are.

37:47.299 --> 37:50.201
Within the scope
of the data you provided,

37:50.302 --> 37:52.103
we are unable to identify
any factors

37:52.203 --> 37:54.373
to indicate the presence
of tachyons.

37:54.473 --> 37:55.974
In the absence of such evidence,

37:56.074 --> 37:58.477
your hypothesis remains
unproven.

37:58.577 --> 37:59.711
No.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.246
No. This...

38:01.347 --> 38:03.181
has to be what it is.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.683
Lives are at stake.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.052
Your emotional response
to factual analysis

38:07.152 --> 38:09.355
is quite illogical
for a scientist.

38:10.188 --> 38:13.559
Perhaps proof may be obtained
another way.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.627
We do have a witness.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.497
Tachyons are superluminal.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.098
Upon hitting
Kwejian's atmosphere,

38:20.198 --> 38:23.402
they would have created
Cherenkov radiation:

38:23.502 --> 38:26.237
a glowing blue cast to the sky.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.273
Paul asked me the same thing
a million times.

38:28.374 --> 38:29.575
I don't remember a glow.

38:29.675 --> 38:31.610
Stored memories
often hold more details

38:31.710 --> 38:35.180
than an individual can access.

38:35.280 --> 38:38.450
A mind meld could uncover them.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.051
STAMETS:
No, no.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.053
You can't ask him to...

38:42.153 --> 38:45.023
He'd have to relive all of it.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.558
What if she's right, though?

38:46.658 --> 38:51.062
You shouldn't be re-traumatized
because of my failure.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.131
I'll figure out the DMA
another way.

38:53.231 --> 38:54.132
Thank you.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.402
But if this is how I can help...

38:57.569 --> 38:59.738
...I want to do it.

39:15.220 --> 39:19.057
-What do I do?
-Just remember.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.628
My mind to your mind.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.963
(distorted, echoing):
My thoughts

39:25.063 --> 39:26.965
-to your thoughts.
-Searched the entire force.

39:27.065 --> 39:30.235
-(voices overlapping, echoing)
-Just do it! Now!

39:30.335 --> 39:33.071
Come on back.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.142
(thudding)

39:50.188 --> 39:52.090
T'RINA:
I have what I need.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.425
BOOK:
No, wait.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.727
There's something else
I need to see.

39:55.827 --> 39:58.497
(chittering, chirping)

39:58.597 --> 40:00.666
Look at them.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.668
It's like they're still here.

40:02.768 --> 40:06.672
T'RINA:
You understand you cannot
alter the memory.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.174
You can only relive it.

40:09.808 --> 40:12.377
BOOK:
There's this moment of Leto
I keep seeing.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.014
The last moment I saw him.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.385
(speaks Kwejian)

40:22.588 --> 40:24.590
KYHEEM:
I'm happy you're here.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.092
*

40:28.293 --> 40:30.228
BOOK:
That's it.

40:30.328 --> 40:33.398
I had turned to my brother,
but Leto looked back at me.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.568
That's what I missed.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.004
He saw me...

40:39.104 --> 40:41.439
and he knew I loved him.

40:47.713 --> 40:50.115
(speaks Kwejian)

40:50.716 --> 40:52.417
(laughs)

40:52.518 --> 40:55.153
(Book speaks Kwejian)

41:07.198 --> 41:09.234
*

41:12.270 --> 41:14.305
(whooshing)

41:17.242 --> 41:18.577
(exhales)

41:18.677 --> 41:20.278
Thank you.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.148
Thank you.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.719
My condolences are...

41:27.819 --> 41:30.021
inadequate.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.390
STAMETS:
Are you all right?

41:32.490 --> 41:34.125
You look...

41:35.360 --> 41:37.295
Did you...

41:37.395 --> 41:38.564
find anything?

41:38.664 --> 41:40.431
There was
no qualitative evidence

41:40.532 --> 41:42.768
of superluminous radiation.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.673
Tachyons were not present.

41:52.277 --> 41:56.047
I'm sorry you had
to go through that for nothing.

41:56.682 --> 41:59.184
It wasn't for nothing.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.295
I found the problem.

42:13.231 --> 42:15.100
(gasps)

42:24.275 --> 42:26.277
(exhales)

42:27.278 --> 42:30.115
They'll wake in a few minutes.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.653
That's why you kept them safe.

42:36.154 --> 42:38.423
This path is at an end, J'Vini.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.692
The next path awaits.

42:44.329 --> 42:46.131
I'm sorry.

42:46.765 --> 42:49.467
(clanking, whirring)

42:49.567 --> 42:51.402
TILLY:
I fixed the engine.

42:51.502 --> 42:54.039
That way,
if the anomaly comes this way,

42:54.139 --> 42:56.374
the Abronians can escape.

43:03.682 --> 43:06.017
Let me.

43:12.490 --> 43:14.626
I understand.

43:20.732 --> 43:24.369
(speaking Romulan in unison)

43:43.188 --> 43:44.723
Hey.

43:44.823 --> 43:47.325
You may want to see this.

43:53.398 --> 43:55.400
*

44:03.441 --> 44:06.745
It's the path
they're meant to be on.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.250
You gave them that.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.320
We gave them that.

44:30.601 --> 44:32.403
TILLY:
J'Vini said

44:32.503 --> 44:35.473
she was unsure of her path
until she met Taglonen.

44:35.573 --> 44:39.344
And then you said that there
was another path ahead.

44:40.278 --> 44:43.148
The Qowat Milat are very big
on the "path" thing, right?

44:43.248 --> 44:48.119
Well, paths end and change
throughout everyone's life.

44:48.219 --> 44:50.455
When we say "choose to live,"

44:50.555 --> 44:53.358
it's an abbreviated form
of a longer saying:

44:53.458 --> 44:56.694
"The path you are on
has come to an end.

44:56.795 --> 44:58.529
Choose to live."

44:59.430 --> 45:01.332
If you find yourself
at the wrong end

45:01.432 --> 45:03.301
of a Qowat Milat sword,
it's pretty easy to see

45:03.401 --> 45:05.370
that particular path
is over for you.

45:05.470 --> 45:08.273
You either move on
to a new path and live,

45:08.373 --> 45:10.275
or you stay and die.

45:10.375 --> 45:14.045
What if the death is
more metaphorical?

45:14.145 --> 45:15.346
In everyday life,

45:15.446 --> 45:19.284
a path's end
can be harder to recognize.

45:20.618 --> 45:23.254
You must be willing
to look inside yourself

45:23.354 --> 45:26.424
with absolute candor.

45:28.526 --> 45:31.329
Another thing
you're very big on.

45:39.570 --> 45:42.373
Thank you
for what you did today.

45:43.541 --> 45:47.278
You wondered why I agreed
to a joint mission.

45:48.679 --> 45:51.282
In truth,
it was because I was afraid

45:51.382 --> 45:53.785
I might not be able
to bring her in.

45:55.386 --> 45:58.023
And I knew you'd make me.

45:58.123 --> 46:00.125
(exhales):
Oh...

46:00.225 --> 46:02.693
Well, you were right, Mom.

46:03.661 --> 46:06.197
Reasons do matter.

46:07.298 --> 46:10.568
She kept an entire species
from extinction.

46:12.270 --> 46:15.373
It doesn't erase her crimes,
but...

46:15.473 --> 46:17.675
it does mean something.

46:20.411 --> 46:23.048
The details of J'Vini's arrest
are in her file.

46:23.148 --> 46:26.251
I would like to formally request
that mitigating circumstances

46:26.351 --> 46:29.554
be taken into account
during her sentencing.

46:29.654 --> 46:32.257
Thank you, Captain Burnham,
for your service.

46:32.357 --> 46:34.525
Your request won't be necessary.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.727
Admiral Vance?

46:36.828 --> 46:38.529
President T'Rina.

46:38.629 --> 46:43.401
Starfleet remands the prisoner
J'Vini to your custody

46:43.501 --> 46:45.370
for extradition to Ni'Var.

46:45.470 --> 46:48.339
Peace and long life.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.382
Jolan tru, daughter.

46:58.516 --> 47:00.618
May you find peace with this.

47:07.025 --> 47:10.061
Tell me
she'll be held accountable.

47:10.161 --> 47:12.630
It's up to Ni'Var now.

47:13.798 --> 47:15.400
You gave me a mission.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.435
Which you executed admirably.

47:17.535 --> 47:20.538
Your role in this matter
has now concluded, Captain.

47:20.638 --> 47:22.107
Admiral.

47:22.207 --> 47:24.309
Patrick Fickett.

47:25.410 --> 47:27.212
First officer of the Credence.

47:27.312 --> 47:28.713
He had a partner, Ha'Ryl.

47:28.813 --> 47:30.015
He had two kids.

47:30.115 --> 47:32.117
Krenn and Na'el.

47:32.217 --> 47:33.584
I know.

47:33.684 --> 47:36.621
Then you know
they deserve justice.

47:37.622 --> 47:39.024
I agree.

47:39.124 --> 47:41.659
I also know bringing Ni'Var
into the Federation

47:41.759 --> 47:44.062
will benefit millions.

47:44.162 --> 47:46.197
Justice will be served, Captain.

47:46.297 --> 47:48.299
In time.

47:52.303 --> 47:54.439
You're really okay with this?

47:55.273 --> 47:57.408
I'd have preferred
a different outcome.

47:57.508 --> 47:59.677
But it's hard to argue
with the president

47:59.777 --> 48:03.982
trusting in Ni'Var
as we ask them to trust in us.

48:05.016 --> 48:07.652
Do you like music, Captain?

48:07.752 --> 48:09.387
Sure.

48:09.487 --> 48:12.223
Think of us as,
um, an orchestra.

48:12.323 --> 48:15.160
You're first chair violin,

48:15.260 --> 48:18.063
with the showy,
challenging solos.

48:18.163 --> 48:19.497
I'm the drum section,

48:19.597 --> 48:22.968
setting the pace,
providing backbone.

48:24.069 --> 48:26.437
She's the conductor.

48:26.537 --> 48:28.639
When she signals us, we play.

48:28.739 --> 48:31.509
It's not our job to know
if the cellist is drunk

48:31.609 --> 48:34.712
or the woodwinds and brass
are at war.

48:34.812 --> 48:37.082
We each have our part,

48:37.182 --> 48:42.287
and we must all trust
that she knows the symphony.

48:44.355 --> 48:46.224
That was a lot of analogy.

48:46.324 --> 48:48.159
Well, they pay me by the letter.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.660
(Burnham laughs)

48:53.264 --> 48:55.266
-(door chimes)
-Come.

48:55.366 --> 48:58.136
-(chittering, chirping)
-Hello.

48:58.236 --> 48:59.237
Ah.

48:59.337 --> 49:01.039
I hear percussion.

49:01.139 --> 49:02.473
What are we listening to?

49:02.573 --> 49:05.276
It is the song
of the Kaminar sea frog.

49:05.376 --> 49:07.378
I fell asleep to their chirps
as a child,

49:07.478 --> 49:11.049
and my recent stay rekindled
my love for their lullaby.

49:11.149 --> 49:12.617
Very beautiful.

49:12.717 --> 49:15.220
Is it strange to be back?

49:16.054 --> 49:17.922
It is...

49:18.023 --> 49:20.358
a work in progress.

49:21.459 --> 49:24.329
But I do my best each day
to find balance.

49:24.429 --> 49:28.433
You suggested to Michael
I go on today's mission, right?

49:29.600 --> 49:32.937
I thought
it might further your...

49:33.038 --> 49:35.506
quest for new experiences.

49:35.606 --> 49:37.342
I hope you found it helpful.

49:37.442 --> 49:39.510
I did. Thank you.

49:40.745 --> 49:42.280
Can I try that?

49:42.380 --> 49:43.414
Certainly.

49:43.514 --> 49:45.416
This is the swampkelp bloom?

49:45.516 --> 49:46.517
It is.

49:46.617 --> 49:48.353
-So what happens if I touch it?
-Uh!

49:48.453 --> 49:49.987
(laughs):
I'm sorry.

49:50.088 --> 49:51.656
-(relieved sigh)
-Just kidding.

49:51.756 --> 49:53.424
Sorry.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.262
(laughs)

50:06.171 --> 50:08.373
(beeping)

50:14.679 --> 50:16.013
(inhales)

50:29.794 --> 50:30.595
(chuckles)

50:30.695 --> 50:32.797
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.268
(laughs)

50:37.368 --> 50:39.070
Are you okay?

50:40.271 --> 50:43.274
Are you... you?

50:51.782 --> 50:54.352
I'm definitely me.

50:57.288 --> 50:59.056
(laughs)

50:59.157 --> 51:00.525
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

51:00.625 --> 51:01.992
(both laugh)

51:08.266 --> 51:10.000
Guardian Xi is on his way.

51:10.101 --> 51:12.203
-Take it slow.
We don't know yet...
-Thank you, thank you,

51:12.303 --> 51:14.472
-thank you, thank you.
-(Adira laughs)

51:14.572 --> 51:16.741
I don't even know
how to thank you.

51:16.841 --> 51:18.709
I had some words planned, but...

51:18.809 --> 51:21.011
they-they don't even come close,
and I...

51:21.112 --> 51:24.014
It's okay.
You don't have to say anything.

51:27.118 --> 51:28.419
GRAY:
Guardian Xi.

51:28.519 --> 51:30.488
We are so grateful you're back.

51:30.588 --> 51:33.791
You get a hug
as soon as I see you in person.

51:37.728 --> 51:38.763
What's it like?

51:38.863 --> 51:40.531
How do you feel?

51:42.400 --> 51:45.136
I'm whole...

51:45.236 --> 51:47.638
and home...

51:47.738 --> 51:50.275
thanks to you.

51:51.142 --> 51:52.610
Wait, did you...

51:52.710 --> 51:54.512
You heard me?

51:55.346 --> 51:57.182
I felt you.

51:57.282 --> 52:00.151
Reaching for me.

52:00.251 --> 52:02.019
Guiding me.

52:02.653 --> 52:06.724
I, um, I wasn't sure
without Tal linking us anymore.

52:07.558 --> 52:10.228
We'll always be linked, Adira.

52:11.229 --> 52:13.631
Always.

52:16.467 --> 52:18.636
(chirping, chittering)

52:39.724 --> 52:41.692
Kwejian forest.

52:44.395 --> 52:47.532
This was too painful a week ago.

52:48.399 --> 52:50.668
It was too painful this morning.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.638
It's still hard.

52:53.738 --> 52:56.006
But also...

52:56.106 --> 52:58.142
nice.

52:58.243 --> 53:01.212
What happened today?

53:02.046 --> 53:04.349
I got a memory back.

53:05.182 --> 53:07.552
And I realized,

53:07.652 --> 53:09.620
someday...

53:09.720 --> 53:13.090
if I'm lucky,
the grief will fade.

53:14.124 --> 53:18.229
And if I don't want all my
other memories to fade with it,

53:18.329 --> 53:21.632
I'll have to open myself
back up to them.

53:23.133 --> 53:25.503
Good and bad.

53:27.538 --> 53:30.341
BURNHAM:
Your Ikhu Zhen amulet.

53:30.441 --> 53:34.245
It's been years
since I've worn it.

53:34.345 --> 53:37.582
It didn't feel right.

53:37.682 --> 53:39.350
Now it does.

53:39.450 --> 53:42.720
You seem peaceful.
