WEBVTT

00:11.136 --> 00:15.181
Oh! I hope I brought enough layers.
I hate being cold!

00:15.807 --> 00:19.269
I did remember my altitude pills,
thank God.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.147
I get so queasy in the mountains.
One time I was--

00:22.230 --> 00:27.068
Stanley, this is three days of men,
snow, and sex. No whining allowed.

00:27.152 --> 00:30.196
I'm not whining. I love gay ski weekend.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.491
It's the only hot boys' event
where I don't have to take my shirt off.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.743
-What up?
-Hiya.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.327
-Here we go.
-I'm getting shotgun.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.954
-Give me this.
-Wow. You look so subtle.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.213
So here are your check-in forms,

00:47.297 --> 00:50.050
and this is an itinerary
with the weekend's activities.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.178
You've been
extremely welcoming, Harrison.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.931
He'll just give it a quick scan
for the hot-tub orgy and throw it away.

00:57.015 --> 01:00.435
The orgy isn't listed, Stanley,
because then anyone could attend.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.228
Hey. Hey! You see that guy?

01:02.312 --> 01:03.563
Blue camo jacket?

01:03.646 --> 01:05.148
I know him. His name's, um…

01:05.231 --> 01:07.984
We met two years ago
at a Realtor conference in Cleveland.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.569
His name's Corey.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.362
Oh! We definitely had some vibes.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.740
But I couldn't do anything
because of Colin. Idiot.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.326
You let commitment get in the way
of sex with a hot guy

01:16.409 --> 01:17.911
in America's most boring city?

01:18.828 --> 01:20.163
Are you nervous?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.625
-You look nervous.
-What? Nervous? No!

01:23.708 --> 01:25.543
No! Okay, maybe a little.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.880
When we met, I was suave and confident
because I knew nothing could happen.

01:28.963 --> 01:32.133
-But now I'm available--
-You can actually have sex with the guy!

01:32.217 --> 01:35.345
Plus, with the thin air up here,
it makes everyone horny.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.515
I can barely breathe,
but I always get laid at altitude.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.183
So go get him.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.228
Hmm. Oh no. He's gone.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.438
No, no, it's better this way.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.109
Now if you happen to run into him
casually, you won't seem so thirsty.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.028
-I love how deftly you can spin shit.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.531
Let's go up to our rooms, get changed,
meet back here in 15?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.866
Make it 45.
I have to find ski clothes to rent.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.576
You're renting ski clothes?

01:59.577 --> 02:01.913
-Who does that?
-You know I never ski.

02:01.996 --> 02:05.708
Why spend a fortune on clothes when I can
just rent them? It's like bowling shoes.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.085
Ugh, yeah. Smelly and cheap.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.670
-Enjoy, guys.
-Thanks.

02:08.753 --> 02:09.963
I'll take two keys.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.591
One for me and…

02:13.675 --> 02:15.135
one for you.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.012
-Smooth!
-Does that ever work?

02:18.096 --> 02:20.098
-It never works.
-Every time.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.182
Every time.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.944
What can I say? My clients liked it,

02:33.027 --> 02:34.779
but they honestly were
a little disappointed.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.824
-They thought it looked better online.
-I hear ya.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.159
I look better online.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.494
Thanks for coming.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.456
Hey, Claire, what are you doing here?

02:45.540 --> 02:48.001
I have a meeting with my architect
in the new apartment.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.544
-Oh!

02:49.627 --> 02:50.461
Question.

02:51.671 --> 02:52.547
Do I seem…

02:54.507 --> 02:55.633
lesbian to you?

02:55.717 --> 02:56.593
Uh…

02:56.676 --> 02:59.721
No. You don't seem
like you like women much at all.

02:59.804 --> 03:00.972
Thank you!

03:01.055 --> 03:04.184
I have been going out
with my divorced girlfriends lately

03:04.267 --> 03:05.852
for some bitter camaraderie,

03:05.935 --> 03:09.355
and more than one of them
has lurched at me at the end of the night

03:09.439 --> 03:11.399
with a drunken, sloppy kiss.

03:12.275 --> 03:16.154
I-- I get that we're all
a little disappointed in men right now,

03:16.237 --> 03:19.574
but what's with the rampant
late-in-life lesbianism?

03:19.657 --> 03:21.201
Chalk it up to boredom.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.746
And it's very cool
to be sexually fluid right now.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.916
Well, that explains my lack of interest.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.001
I've never been very cool.

03:30.084 --> 03:33.421
Well, at least there's less shame
about sexuality.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.590
We don't have to just choose a box
and stay in it.

03:35.673 --> 03:39.802
-I hear that, but I like my box.
-Sounds like your girlfriends do too.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.181
-Oh!

03:43.765 --> 03:44.766
I guess!

03:44.849 --> 03:46.517
So what are you up to tonight?

03:46.601 --> 03:49.229
I'm meeting my friend Mia at Ten West.

03:49.312 --> 03:53.900
God, Henry was dying to get into that club
once upon a time, but they rejected him.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.109
Oh.

03:56.653 --> 04:00.990
Wouldn't it just kill him if he found out
that I got in there before he did?

04:01.574 --> 04:02.659
Aah…

04:02.742 --> 04:05.161
Yeah. That would be very cool for you.

04:05.245 --> 04:10.083
I mean, to shove something like that
in his face could be delicious!

04:10.166 --> 04:11.042
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm!

04:11.125 --> 04:13.044
-Fuck that clown!
-Oh.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.840
I bet a little victory like that
would be healing for me,

04:18.758 --> 04:20.635
as a woman and as a mother,

04:20.718 --> 04:22.845
which I'm sure
someone like you understands…

04:22.929 --> 04:26.474
Oh! Hey! Would you like to come with us?

04:26.557 --> 04:29.310
Oh! Yes! Good God.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.813
I hope I didn't make you
work that hard to sell my apartment.

04:31.896 --> 04:32.981
Oh, you did!

04:41.614 --> 04:44.867
It's true. Everyone does look sexier
in ski gear.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.830
I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror
and was like, "Oh, hey, James Bond."

04:48.913 --> 04:51.833
Play it cool, 007, when you find
your man with the golden dick.

04:51.916 --> 04:52.834
-Hah!

04:52.917 --> 04:53.793
Hello.

04:53.876 --> 04:57.005
Oh, hey, look! Pink is back!
Who missed it?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.675
-Anyone?
-It's YSL. Thank you.

05:00.758 --> 05:04.012
-A woman at the shop told me--
-"I have the same one"?

05:06.472 --> 05:09.100
-It's all they had in my size!
-A ladies' 14?

05:09.183 --> 05:10.059
Oh, whatever.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.022
You paid thousands of dollars for yours.
I paid 80. Who's the fool now?

05:14.105 --> 05:16.733
Girls, you're both pretty.
Can we ski now, please?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.359
Yo. What's up, brother?

05:19.193 --> 05:20.236
What's up, brother?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.195
You know that guy?

05:21.279 --> 05:24.324
No, just sayin' what's up.
I bet he did Jack and Jill as a kid too.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.575
What's Jack and Jill?

05:25.658 --> 05:28.411
It's a social club some Black parents
make their kids join

05:28.494 --> 05:30.538
to learn to ski and other bougie shit.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.249
Aw! Billy. That was kind of sweet,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.376
hearing you tell a story
that wasn't about sex.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.462
I did get my first hand job on a ski lift.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.131
-Okay.
-Oh, oh! There he is! Oh! Blue camo!

05:40.214 --> 05:41.966
-Ooh! Go!
-Blue-- Oh--

05:42.050 --> 05:44.260
-What are you waitin' for?
-I-- I don't know.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.805
-See you at the bottom, you big bottom!
-Oh, you!

05:48.306 --> 05:49.390
Ow!

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
Hey, Corey, right?

05:55.772 --> 05:58.733
Michael Lawson.
We met two years ago in Cleveland.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.069
At the-- at the Realtor conference.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.696
Michael from New York.
Of course I remember.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.323
-Nice to see you here.
-You too.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.492
I remember you had that boyfriend.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.287
I don't remember these shoulders.
Somebody's been hittin' the gym.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.830
Um… About that…

06:13.956 --> 06:14.916
Oh!

06:14.999 --> 06:15.958
-Sorry!
-He's…

06:16.542 --> 06:20.046
We're not together anymore.
I don't have a boyfriend!

06:21.881 --> 06:23.466
I'm single now!

06:33.351 --> 06:34.268
I can't believe it.

06:34.352 --> 06:38.398
I was mid flirt, then next thing I know,
I'm going ass backwards down the mountain.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.274
Babe, it's gay ski weekend.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.527
Not gay ski afternoon.
You'll see him again.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.947
You're right. Keep your eyes peeled
for a blue camo coat.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.784
Hmm. Good news,
it's the only coat like that I've seen.

06:49.867 --> 06:53.371
Bad news, there's two other women
over there in Stanley's outfit.

06:53.454 --> 06:57.417
I don't care. I got lucky wearing
a cheerleader skirt once for Halloween.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.336
I am not gonna let ladies' ski pants
bring me down.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.295
-Wow.
-Oh my.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.755
Fireball shots to warm up?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.799
-N-- no, thanks.
-Yes, please!

07:04.882 --> 07:08.594
-Why not?
-One of these at this altitude equals two.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.097
-Please.
-Don't start with the drink math, Stanley.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.893
Michael! How funny you are here.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.229
I never see you
at these sexy gay weekends.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.522
Hello, Horst.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.731
I heard you were dumped.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.860
I'm sorry. But now you're in the same boat
as the rest of us,<i> ja?</i>

07:24.819 --> 07:26.904
Care to join me
and my ski pals for dinner?

07:26.988 --> 07:30.116
-No, thanks. I'm here with my own friends.
-Hi.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.827
Hi, what a good idea. Boys' trip!

07:33.453 --> 07:37.373
It's the perfect thing to do when your
hot ex is on a romantic getaway in Miami.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.960
What are you talking about?
Colin's in Miami?

07:41.043 --> 07:44.172
<i>Ja. </i>My favorite instructor
at Barry's Boot Camp's ex-husband Robbie

07:44.255 --> 07:45.173
is dating him.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.425
I saw a picture of them in Miami
on his Instagram.

07:47.508 --> 07:51.554
Why didn't you tell me you split up?
He really was so hot.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.849
We'll be at the fondue pot at 8:00.

07:54.932 --> 07:57.143
I'll save you a fork
if you change your mind.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.147
-Oh my God.
-Michael, don't get crazy.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.524
Yeah, maybe Eva Braun
over there is mistaken.

08:03.608 --> 08:04.442
You heard him.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.736
He saw them on his favorite
Barry's Boot Camp instructor's

08:06.819 --> 08:08.362
ex-husband Robbie's Instagram.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.908
Well, whatever. This is the last thing
you should be thinking about.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.786
Do you think it's just a fling, or this
Robbie's a real person with a real job?

08:15.870 --> 08:19.499
And if they're on some romantic getaway
in Miami, do you think this is serious?

08:19.582 --> 08:20.583
Wh-- what are you doing?

08:20.666 --> 08:23.336
I'm searching Horst's Instagram
for Robbie's profile.

08:23.419 --> 08:27.423
Wait, you don't think Colin would bring
him to the Jonathans' wedding, do you?

08:27.507 --> 08:28.466
Oh my God.

08:28.549 --> 08:32.845
I'm going to have to sit there and watch
Colin start his new future. Shit!

08:33.429 --> 08:37.683
Horst knows, like, eight Robbies,
and half of them have private accounts.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.185
Michael, snap out of it!

08:39.727 --> 08:40.561
You have Corey.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.940
Or you will when you remember
you're at gay ski weekend to have fun,

08:44.023 --> 08:45.233
not obsess over your ex.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.610
Exactly. Let it go.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.738
You're right. You're right.

08:50.821 --> 08:54.659
I have Corey. I don't need to care
about where Colin is. I will.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.369
I will let it go, for real.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.330
But I will take
one more of those fireball shots!

09:05.336 --> 09:07.672
-Sorry, you're not on the list.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.631
Fuck that list.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.551
Do you see two fine-ass ladies
tryin' to get in the club?

09:11.634 --> 09:15.513
Can you look again under Suzanne Prentiss,
double S, as in super special?

09:15.596 --> 09:18.432
Didn't you two yell at me
when I worked at Soho House?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.560
-Nope. Never been.
-That's racist.

09:21.185 --> 09:23.604
Okay. Just check with Trey.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.440
Fine. Step aside, please.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.818
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

09:28.901 --> 09:31.529
And remind him
that it's Kai's mother plus two.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.699
What a minute, plus two?
Who else is comin'?

09:34.782 --> 09:37.410
Oh, client. She's about to get a divorce.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.621
She wants to rub it in her ex-husband's
face that she's partyin' at Ten West.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.791
Okay, I get that.
But how is she? Is she chill?

09:43.874 --> 09:46.294
Sorry I'm late.

09:46.377 --> 09:50.047
I laid out 15 outfits on the bed
and then just went with all black.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.258
I look like I flew here on a broom.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.175
You look great.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.052
-So great I wanna make out with ya.
-Oh!

09:55.136 --> 09:56.262
-Ha-ha!

09:56.345 --> 09:57.221
Trey vouched.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.098
-You can go up.
-Thank you.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.308
Attitude!

10:00.391 --> 10:04.895
You must be Mia. I'm Claire Lewis.
Thank you for letting me crash your party.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.689
-Let's check my fur.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.943
You won't like her at first,
but you'll warm up as the night goes on.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.361
Appreciate the heads-up.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.614
-Let's go, ladies!
-Whoo!

10:14.697 --> 10:16.616
<i>
-Hey!</i>

10:16.699 --> 10:19.994
Oh, this is cute!
We got cute ones in here tonight!

10:20.077 --> 10:21.579
Aah!

10:22.079 --> 10:23.414
Oh my God, look!

10:23.497 --> 10:24.498
Suzanne!

10:24.582 --> 10:25.791
Oh, hey, Trey.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.961
I'm so sorry. Kai asked me
to put you on the list, and I spaced.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.340
I feel awful, trust me. I don't like
to disappoint a beautiful woman.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.092
First drink is on me.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.012
You guys wanna order,
or should I surprise you?

10:38.095 --> 10:42.099
You can surprise me with a double
Belvedere up with two olives, very cold.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.643
-Make it three.
-All right.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.897
Suzanne, I think that young man
has a little thing for you.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.358
I have told her that!

10:50.441 --> 10:53.569
He flirts with her so hard
every time we use him to get into places.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.487
Stop.

10:54.570 --> 10:58.699
Even if that were true, which it's not,
that is my son's best friend. Pass!

10:58.783 --> 11:03.079
Come on. Wouldn't it be nice to spend
a romantic evening with a young man

11:03.162 --> 11:06.666
who wants to get into your vagina,
rather than one who came out of it?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.209
-She's funny!

11:08.793 --> 11:10.086
-Warming.
-Mm-hmm!

11:10.169 --> 11:13.756
Okay, someone take a picture of me here so
I can make my ex-husband feel like shit!

11:13.839 --> 11:17.301
No, no, no, no, no! They don't allow
pics here. They will throw us out.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.471
-We have to be stealth about this.
-And you can't post on Instagram.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.264
My friend Marcus tagged a pic here.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.059
They came after him
like the Scientologists went after Leah.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.353
I'm not on any of those things.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.855
I'm going to text a photo
to my oldest child,

11:29.939 --> 11:31.357
the one who's still a daughter,

11:31.440 --> 11:35.027
because she's mad at her father for dating
someone barely older than she is.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.698
I use my kids
to fuck with my ex-husband too!

11:38.781 --> 11:42.243
I mean, the shit I've gotten away with.
I should be the KGB.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.663
This is the fun you missed out on,
not knowing who Kai's father is.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.332
I also missed out
on gettin' left like you two.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.545
-Oh…
-Okay. Still fresh.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.504
-I get it.
-I'm sorry.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.464
Here we go. Have a seat.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.093
Ooh! Thank you, Trey. This is cute skrt.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.016
I've also got a little molly
if you're looking.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.562
-Oh no. Who do you think I am? I can't!
-Not so fast!

12:10.771 --> 12:13.941
I've never done it. My kids are grown.
What am I waiting for?

12:14.024 --> 12:17.194
And it looked so fun
when J. Lo did it in <i>Hustlers</i>.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.490
-That's two yeses to your one no.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.577
Okay, fine. Ju-- Maybe just a smidge.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.581
Oh!

12:29.957 --> 12:32.209
-Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:32.293 --> 12:33.377
Oh, I'm so excited!

12:33.461 --> 12:38.048
Either he's already done some of that,
or he is dying to get wit' you.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.302
Is that okay to say that? "Get wit' you?"

12:41.385 --> 12:43.554
-I'mma need to sit wit' it.
-I'm on board.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.638
Okay!

12:48.684 --> 12:53.105
I am so lucky
that you are both my best friends.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.900
And I'm forever grateful
that you get to be with me

12:55.983 --> 12:58.652
-while my life is literally falling apart.
-Oh!

12:58.736 --> 13:00.863
Take it easy with the booze there, gushy.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.532
You don't wanna cross over
into wasted sorority girl territory.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.409
I'm not wasted. I promise.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.912
Or sad. Or thinking about Colin.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.791
-I need to find Horst.
-No, you don't.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.795
I do, as a matter of fact,
because I sent him many texts,

13:15.878 --> 13:18.631
and none of them have gone through
'cause the service here sucks.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.300
-Okay, let's get an espresso in you, huh?
-Good idea.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.636
-You stay right there.
-Stay. Don't move.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.224
-I think he's had four of those fireballs.
-Yeah.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.392
Which, as we know, equals eight.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.938
-What's up?
-Oh, cute.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.110
Michael.

13:40.861 --> 13:45.157
-I thought I lost you on the slopes.
-Corey. You're he-- here.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.867
And in a robe.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.119
I was worried about you.

13:49.954 --> 13:50.955
Nah.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.250
Oh, by the way, I don't have a boyfriend.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.795
Yeah, I heard. So did the entire mountain.
You know, the echo.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.129
Right.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.131
Cool, cool.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.133
Um…

14:04.468 --> 14:06.345
Glad there wasn't an avalanche.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.556
Well,

14:09.598 --> 14:12.768
there is still time
to make this mountain shake.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.272
-Come find me in the hot tub.
-Absolutely.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.238
Guys! Guys!

14:25.197 --> 14:27.950
I found Corey.
He wants me to meet him in the hot tub!

14:28.033 --> 14:29.201
-All right!
-Aw!

14:29.285 --> 14:30.661
-Well, knock this back.
-Yeah.

14:30.744 --> 14:33.956
-Knock it back.
-Put on a robe and get your ass in there.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.291
-Mm--
-Pyeoww!

14:35.374 --> 14:36.667
-Oh!
-Hey, that's hot!

14:37.167 --> 14:38.502
Okay.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.799
So you gonna let me--
Okay. Don't tell a soul.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.643
Horst, wait up!

15:07.072 --> 15:08.115
Michael!

15:08.198 --> 15:10.075
We missed you at fondue!

15:10.159 --> 15:12.661
Now we're dancing off
the bread and the cheese.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.540
Horst, you follow four Robbies
and 12 Roberts,

15:16.624 --> 15:18.709
and almost all of them
have private accounts.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.878
I need to see that guy's Instagram page.

15:20.961 --> 15:25.382
I apologize for telling you about Robbie.
That was a bad thing for a friend to do.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.550
Are we friend…

15:27.051 --> 15:28.052
Never mind. Um…

15:28.135 --> 15:30.471
I need to see Robbie's account, please.

15:30.554 --> 15:34.391
Are you sure that's a good idea?
You are a crier. I've seen it.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.436
-Just let me see the damn picture!
-Oh God.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.273
Ugh! Here.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.652
Fuck!

15:46.070 --> 15:48.072
Colin looks so happy.

15:48.155 --> 15:51.951
It's not his fake smile
like in family pictures.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.536
That's his real smile,
like when he looks at money.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.997
Please tell me Robbie's a cater waiter.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.791
He's a successful architect.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.002
Like super driven
to make up for his small penis?

16:02.086 --> 16:03.379
<i>Nein.</i>

16:03.462 --> 16:04.838
Is that German for no?

16:06.924 --> 16:09.802
Oh, I guess not. Oh God.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.262
That poor Speedo. It's working so hard.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.932
May I have my phone back now?

16:16.517 --> 16:19.979
I can unlock some hot private photos
on his Grindr if you want.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.738
…that big a deal
for purple lingerie to be lying around…

16:29.822 --> 16:31.865
-I have no idea!
-Now it's a thing?

16:31.949 --> 16:32.825
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

16:32.908 --> 16:33.993
Uh, what are you doing here?

16:34.076 --> 16:36.120
-I thought you were in the tub with Corey.
-Hey! Whoa!

16:36.203 --> 16:38.038
Whoa, hey, that's six! Oh!

16:38.122 --> 16:40.749
Uh, which is really 12.
He should be in rehab.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.210
Colin's moved on with a hot architect

16:43.293 --> 16:46.714
who is younger, better-looking,
and way more successful than me.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.509
Oh, come on, that just means
it's time for you to move on too.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.637
I can definitely think
of one good way to do that.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.305
Huh?

16:55.389 --> 16:56.306
Whoosh!

16:56.390 --> 16:57.433
Brrr!

16:58.267 --> 17:01.270
-Bub-bub-bub-bub-bub-bub!
-Is that supposed to be a hot tub?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.188
-Yes!
-Who swims in a hot tub?

17:03.272 --> 17:07.651
It wasn't swimming.
I mean, it was saying water. Hot water.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.199
-Newsflash. I love molly.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.869
I like the way the lights glow.

17:16.952 --> 17:20.497
I love the feel
of the glass in my hand.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.083
It's all just extra.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.044
Did I use that right? Extra?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.420
-You actually did.
-Yeah.

17:26.503 --> 17:30.007
Oh! And I feel beautiful.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.884
Which is so welcome.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.720
Would you take a picture of me
now, when I'm feeling so beautiful?

17:34.803 --> 17:39.391
Yes. But let's be real cool about it.
Hand me the phone. Nice and easy.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.560
Hurry up. Do it quick.
Do it right now.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.021
Ooh!

17:44.104 --> 17:47.608
Your phone will be waiting at the door
when you leave, or I can walk you out now.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.942
It's not mine. It's hers.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.279
How about I give you $200,

17:52.362 --> 17:56.450
and you give me my phone back,
and we pretend like this never happened?

17:57.618 --> 18:01.580
Ugh! Youth and their ethics.
Exhausting!

18:03.999 --> 18:07.086
Don't get me in trouble, woman.
Or you're gonna owe me.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.754
Big.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.131
My God!

18:11.215 --> 18:15.719
Suzanne, wake up, girl!
That boy wants to get all up on you.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.055
It is as plain as day.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.682
What do you think "owe me big" means?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.142
Okay, okay, I gotta admit,

18:22.226 --> 18:24.686
it seems like he's working me,
but I can't believe it.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.730
I'm his friend's mother.

18:29.691 --> 18:30.776
Oh!

18:30.859 --> 18:32.402
It's on!

18:32.486 --> 18:34.488
Can I say that? "It's on."

18:34.571 --> 18:36.824
It's all fine, girl. Stop askin' us.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.369
No fucking way.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.412
Claire!

18:43.288 --> 18:45.499
Oh… my.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.793
Ooh, what a surprise.

18:47.876 --> 18:54.258
Uh… Suzanne, Mia,
this is Henry, my ex-husband.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.592
And… Oh.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.387
Sorry, I've forgotten your name.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.513
Layla.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.056
-Hello.
-Hey.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.433
It's so odd seeing you here.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.146
It's like spotting Jane Austen at CBGB's.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.730
Oh! I get it.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.775
Because I'm so out of place
at a hip, downtown club.

19:11.859 --> 19:15.279
Well, what's funny
is that I'm shocked to see you here.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.656
It's nice they didn't reject you
a fifth time.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.117
-Well, I'm a member. I got us in.
-Oh.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.828
I thought you had to be at least 21
to belong here.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.081
Be nice, Claire.
I'm actually happy for you.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.041
You're getting out, trying new things.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.794
And who am I to say
you won't meet someone here?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.379
Some old pots find new lids.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.382
Oh, Henry, you are such a fool.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.260
You think you're winning,

19:38.343 --> 19:41.263
but you look like you're being
escorted around by your nurse.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.682
And I am not on the prowl

19:43.765 --> 19:47.019
for a-- a young piece of ass,
if that's what you're implying.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.021
I already have a lid for my pot.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.481
Mm!

19:54.526 --> 19:55.694
Mm!

19:56.403 --> 19:58.155
That's right. I'm fluid!

19:58.238 --> 20:03.994
Now please go away before I ask Trey,
that's the bartender, whose name I know,

20:04.077 --> 20:05.287
to make you go away.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.957
Good luck, ladies.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.584
Bye!

20:13.170 --> 20:14.296
Wow!

20:15.172 --> 20:18.634
That felt really good.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.930
That fat fuck didn't know what hit him.

20:23.013 --> 20:27.351
You think he's fat? I hope we never
run into each other after the holidays.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.686
I won that round, didn't I?

20:29.770 --> 20:30.938
Ooh, you did!

20:31.021 --> 20:34.107
We're gonna have to have a little
talk about consent later, but you did win.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.490
-Oh!
-You made it!

20:43.367 --> 20:44.368
May I…

20:45.452 --> 20:47.871
-Corey, may I… May I join you?
-Hi.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.623
I'd be bummed if you didn't.

20:55.837 --> 20:56.672
Watch it.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.966
Ah… Ooh! Ooh!

21:00.342 --> 21:01.176
-Feels good?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.261
-Ooh!

21:02.344 --> 21:03.178
Finally,

21:03.262 --> 21:04.888
I am all…

21:06.223 --> 21:08.558
I promise I'm all yours.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.280
Is it hot in here? Are you hot?

21:21.363 --> 21:22.614
-You tell me.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.996
I mean, I know you're hot,
but are you also aggressively warm?

21:30.414 --> 21:32.499
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, no, I'm-- Yeah, I'm good.

21:32.582 --> 21:33.792
You don't look so good.

21:33.875 --> 21:39.214
It's just I think I had too many
of those fireballs and fajitas.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.340
-Oh!

21:40.424 --> 21:41.675
-No!

21:41.758 --> 21:42.801
No! No, no!2

21:42.884 --> 21:44.136
-No! No, no!

21:44.219 --> 21:45.595
-God! Yuck!

21:47.055 --> 21:49.349
That was bad.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.767
Oh! Disgusting!

21:50.851 --> 21:53.270
You turned that hot tub
into a Chipotle bowl.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.022
-But I feel better now.
-Mm.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.481
How-- how is Corey?

21:56.565 --> 21:57.733
Oh, just delighted.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.401
-You shared a meal together.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.195
-Oh!
-Easy there, Tonya Harding.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.323
-Hey, let's go to the top of the…
-Oh!

22:04.406 --> 22:07.784
Tomorrow, we'll go to the top of the lift.
We can go at 8:00 a.m.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.120
Totally. But don't talk.
There's a breath thing.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.039
Had I known this was
where my night was headed,

22:12.122 --> 22:14.207
I'd have rented grippier boots.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.418
-I love you guys so much.
-Oof!

22:16.501 --> 22:18.962
-Okay, we love you too.
-I lo-- No, so much.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.005
I know, so much.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.674
And the eighth time
you tell your friends you love 'em,

22:22.758 --> 22:25.510
you might wanna kneel down near a toilet.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.889
Can we hurry? I have an eager-to-please
hotel clerk waiting in my room!

22:28.972 --> 22:32.351
All right, hold on to Michael
while I unlock the door.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.769
-Oh!

22:33.852 --> 22:35.312
Whew!

22:35.395 --> 22:36.646
Oh, what's up?

22:37.147 --> 22:38.273
-Oh! Michael!
-What--

22:41.902 --> 22:44.613
And guess who noticed that kiss?

22:45.947 --> 22:48.116
Girl, you need to make this happen.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.409
She is so right.

22:49.493 --> 22:53.747
He's obviously just waiting for you
to go make the first move out of respect.

22:53.830 --> 22:57.167
Men are terrified of women now,
as they should be.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.629
You're not gonna stop hounding me
until I go over there, are you?

23:00.712 --> 23:03.548
Hey, Trey! You got a sec?

23:08.678 --> 23:11.098
Uh… So, um…

23:11.765 --> 23:15.268
I'm feeling kind of weird about
everything you've seen me do tonight,

23:15.352 --> 23:18.563
and I would love it
if you didn't mention it to Kai.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.358
What are you talking about?
You're allowed to do whatever you want.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.318
In theory. Yeah.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.529
But the, um… the molly,

23:26.029 --> 23:27.489
the kiss,

23:27.989 --> 23:29.032
you and me flirting.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.201
Oh! Oh shit, did that upset you?

23:31.284 --> 23:34.413
That's just part of the bartender's job.
I flirt with everybody.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.834
That guy in the black suit thinks we're
going to the Hamptons for the weekend.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.002
Oh!

23:41.503 --> 23:43.672
Oh, cool. No, I, um…

23:43.755 --> 23:46.299
I knew-- I knew that.
I was just playing with you too.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.760
And Kai would be fine with all this,
by the way.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.889
Maybe, but I need to keep
a certain image with him.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.143
It's been a lot of pressure,
single momming it all these years,

23:56.226 --> 23:57.477
being his mother and his father.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.896
Well, hey, at least you won't have
to do that much longer

23:59.980 --> 24:01.314
now that he found his dad.

24:04.359 --> 24:05.735
Uh…

24:06.945 --> 24:07.779
Sorry, I…

24:08.738 --> 24:11.199
The music got really loud. One more time?

24:11.283 --> 24:15.203
I said now that he found his dad.
You know, on 23andMe.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.748
Maybe it'll ease some of that pressure,
and you'll finally get to just be his mom.

24:22.669 --> 24:26.423
Oh fuck, did you not know this?
Uh-- He told me he was gonna tell you!

24:26.506 --> 24:28.717
No, no, no. He-- He, um… No, he did.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.927
-Oh.
-No, he…

24:31.011 --> 24:33.472
He told me. Yeah. Uh…

24:34.264 --> 24:38.685
I, um… I was just ridin' a serious wave.
Feelin' a little too high.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.020
It's your fault, boy!

24:41.980 --> 24:42.981
So, um…

24:44.316 --> 24:49.488
Yeah, so I'm good if you're good,
and, um… go work, flirt, do your thing.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.283
Um… And zip it with Kai.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.284
You got it.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.368
-Yeah?
-Mm.

24:55.869 --> 24:56.703
Okay.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.378
Uh-huh.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.130
Yeah.

25:08.089 --> 25:08.924
Okay.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.426
Yeah, thank you.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.347
That was the front desk.
They're draining the hot tub.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.891
I'm assuming the hazmat charges
are on our bill.

25:17.974 --> 25:20.810
Oh God. Is that when this happened?

25:21.394 --> 25:23.480
That was later.
Billy dropped you on your face.

25:23.563 --> 25:26.483
I'm sorry. It was just a quick hello.

25:26.566 --> 25:29.986
I can't believe this is the face
I'm gonna have at the Jonathans' wedding

25:30.654 --> 25:34.324
where I have to see Colin after he's
refreshed from a weekend in Miami

25:34.407 --> 25:37.077
having great sex
with his hot new architect boyfriend.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.121
You don't know that.
I mean, the sex could be bad.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.833
I'm sorry Colin found a way
of ruining this weekend for you, sweets.

25:43.917 --> 25:47.879
No, Colin didn't ruin this weekend.
I did that all by myself.

25:48.755 --> 25:52.676
I've been carrying him around with me
everywhere I go, in everything I do,

25:52.759 --> 25:55.929
ruining any chance of something… else.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.391
-Look what I did to myself.
-Actually, Billy did that.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.600
No, not Billy.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.687
I was the one who got so drunk
that I couldn't even walk.

26:04.396 --> 26:07.065
Not to mention, I actually had
a second chance with Corey,

26:07.148 --> 26:08.400
and I messed that up too.

26:08.483 --> 26:11.236
If it helps, I noticed when he dragged you
out of the hot tub

26:11.319 --> 26:13.446
that he had freakishly small calves.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.283
And no baby toenail. None.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.411
I can't do this anymore.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.788
I have to turn a corner.

26:21.871 --> 26:25.500
It is time to let Colin go
and move the fuck on.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.422
I just want this pain to go away.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.135
It's gonna go away, right?

26:36.803 --> 26:38.805
It might leave the teensiest scar.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.140
Huh.

26:45.478 --> 26:46.646
I can live with that.
