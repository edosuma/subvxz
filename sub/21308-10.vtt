Kingdoms of Mewni,

00:50.790 --> 00:52.880
each year,
we hold this dance

00:52.880 --> 00:55.750
to celebrate
the peace between us.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.330
Welcome to
the Silver Bell Ball.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.040
Whoo hoo!

01:05.040 --> 01:06.830
Yeah!

01:08.000 --> 01:10.460
The rules of the ball
are the same as always.

01:10.460 --> 01:14.250
Each royal heir
will dance with all the others,

01:14.250 --> 01:16.880
representing the bonds
between our kingdoms.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.620
Their kingdom got
taken over by rats.

01:19.620 --> 01:22.000
How could they
let that happen?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.790
Hey, hey,
they were big rats.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.790
Oh, girl,
okay, okay.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.790
What do you think
of the line
Be honest.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.120
It's just the same
bunch of borings
as every year, Pony.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.960
Okay, that's fine,
but, like, check out

01:32.960 --> 01:34.710
Prince Larry Kelpbottom.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.290
Mm-hmm, okay.
Somebody came up

01:36.290 --> 01:38.290
and hit him with
a hottie stick.

01:38.290 --> 01:40.790
Guess it is kinda cool
to see everyone dance.

01:40.790 --> 01:42.330
- Hey, Princess Jaggs.
- Hey.

01:42.330 --> 01:44.000
Hi, Princess
Spider Bite.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.830
Hello.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.880
Oh, look, there's
your annoying cousin.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.380
Yeah. Guess
I should say hi.
Hi, Rock.

01:51.620 --> 01:52.920
Hi, Rock.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.380
Your cousin.
Over here.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.960
Rock Johansen.
Okay, he hasn't changed.

01:57.960 --> 02:02.040
Oh, looks like Rich Pigeon
got himself some new legs.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.420
Ooh, somebody's
missing, Star.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.880
Yep.
He's always late.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.920
This is where
you two met, isn't it?

02:08.920 --> 02:09.830
Mm-hmm.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.960
Drama.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.710
Drama!

02:17.460 --> 02:19.620
Drama, drama, drama,
drama, drama, drama...

02:19.620 --> 02:21.670
Pony, no drama this year.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.040
I told my parents

02:23.040 --> 02:24.670
I was gonna focus on
the princess biz.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.250
Oh, come on,
you're the bomb
at shakin' up

02:26.250 --> 02:28.040
these dusty
old traditions, girl.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.880
- Not this year.
- Oh, come on.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.120
- No.
- Come on.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.620
No, Pony.
Seriously.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.330
Did you not hear me
when I said come on?

02:35.330 --> 02:37.420
- Come on, come on.
- I'm serious.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.960
Sh!

02:39.960 --> 02:42.790
I've caused a lot
of trouble this summer.

02:42.790 --> 02:45.040
It's time to be
a better princess.

02:49.580 --> 02:51.290
Sunglasses at night.

02:51.290 --> 02:53.040
Classy.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.380
MANFRED: Announcing
the arrival of

02:54.380 --> 02:57.500
Prince Thomas Lucitor.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.880
Hey, everybody.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.830
And his parents,
Lord and Lady Lucitor,

03:00.830 --> 03:01.790
of the underworld.

03:08.170 --> 03:10.080
Hello, Wrathmeelior.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.170
- Hi, Dave.
- Hey.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.250
Will the dancers
please stand

03:14.250 --> 03:15.750
for the commencement bow?

03:20.380 --> 03:23.040
Did you just see that?

03:23.040 --> 03:24.920
Ho ho ho, yes!

03:24.920 --> 03:27.120
Ooh, I think
the whole room saw that.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.580
Girl, you're
getting club-snubbed.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.170
Oh, no...
What is that?

03:31.170 --> 03:34.000
Oh, I don't know,
it's just the best way

03:34.000 --> 03:35.750
to get someone
all up in your business.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.380
Watch.
Hey, Kelpbottom.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.000
Kelpbottom!

03:40.000 --> 03:42.500
No, no, not you. Not you.
The handsome one.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.750
You hear that, honey?
I'm the handsome one.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.040
Pony, what the...
I thought you liked him.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.920
Oh, I do, I do.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.000
But listen, the more
you ignore somebody,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
the more they fall
deeply in love with you.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.960
That's, like, science.
It's scientific or
something like that.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.880
Ugh, okay. Can you please
give me some space,

03:59.880 --> 04:01.380
'cause I really
need that from you, okay?

04:01.380 --> 04:03.000
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.960
- It works every time.
- Weird.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.330
Let the first dance begin.

04:08.330 --> 04:11.210
Ahem.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.040
Anyone?

04:13.040 --> 04:15.750
Oh, my.
It seems Prince Thomas

04:15.750 --> 04:17.330
has taken
the initiative,

04:17.330 --> 04:21.290
and he appears to be
walking towards Princess Star.

04:21.290 --> 04:23.170
Star and Thomas
have always been

04:23.170 --> 04:26.120
the best dancers at
every Silver Bell Ball,

04:26.120 --> 04:30.210
and we all know they had
a very tumultuous relationship

04:30.210 --> 04:32.170
before breaking up
last year.

04:32.170 --> 04:35.000
Manfred.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.580
May I have this dance...

04:36.580 --> 04:38.670
Well, all right.
Let's do this.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.000
Princess Jaggs?

04:42.580 --> 04:45.750
Uh, yeah, okay.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.040
You look lovely today.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.120
What? No, you do.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.540
Well, this is
a surprising
turn of events.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.000
No mistake.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.540
At the previous
Silver Bell Balls,

04:57.540 --> 05:00.290
Tom always chose
Princess Star first to dance.

05:08.620 --> 05:11.420
Pony, I think I am
getting club-snubbed.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.670
Ooh, this is some
next-level club-snubbing.

05:14.670 --> 05:16.460
He wants you bad, girl.

05:16.460 --> 05:19.170
Ugh. Tom always does this.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.830
When is he gonna realize
I'm not interested?

05:20.830 --> 05:24.120
Okay, calm yourself,
Butterfly.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.120
You're a princess,
for goodness sake.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.040
Oh, it's on.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.880
Hm, let's see,
let's see.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.080
- I choose you.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.250
Oh, oh, oh!

05:44.250 --> 05:48.620
Oh, Princess Star
has chosen Prince Rich Pigeon

05:48.620 --> 05:50.080
as her first dance partner.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.460
Could there be
a new romance waiting

05:52.460 --> 05:54.170
in the wings?

05:54.170 --> 05:56.920
Oh, Richard.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.000
I had no idea you were
such a good dancer.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.710
Good job, girl.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.170
Mm-hmm, that
oughta show him.

07:06.330 --> 07:09.420
At last, the dancers
have completed the ceremony,

07:09.420 --> 07:10.830
and are seated
with their parents.

07:10.830 --> 07:14.920
All except Star
and Thomas.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.210
They're saving
the best for last.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.290
Hmm.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.880
Come on, Star.
Dance with him.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.210
May I have this dance...

07:31.210 --> 07:32.620
Manfred?

07:34.210 --> 07:35.170
Oh, dear.

07:35.170 --> 07:38.330
Oh, snap!

07:38.330 --> 07:40.330
No one has ever
asked me to dance.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.920
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:43.920 --> 07:46.210
Star has asked me,
Manfred,

07:46.210 --> 07:48.000
to the dance floor.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.210
I feel like
I'm in a dream.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.380
Your daughter just
club-snubbed my son.

07:51.380 --> 07:54.210
Your son's been
club-snubbing
my daughter all night!

07:54.210 --> 07:55.710
My son
is a gentleman.

07:55.710 --> 07:58.420
My daughter is
a delicate flower.

07:58.420 --> 08:02.080
Delicate flower? Let's see
how delicate a flower you are!

08:02.080 --> 08:04.460
- Unbelievable!

08:05.500 --> 08:08.290
No, no, no, no,
you do not get to make

08:08.290 --> 08:09.210
sad eyes at me.

08:09.210 --> 08:10.920
This is your fault.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.250
Look, I still don't
wanna date you.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.710
I have been through
a lot lately,

08:14.710 --> 08:16.710
and what I really
need is a friend.

08:16.710 --> 08:19.420
But all you wanna do
is play your little
childish games.

08:19.420 --> 08:20.250
Games?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.420
Oh, don't act
all innocent,

08:22.420 --> 08:23.790
you club-snubber.

08:23.790 --> 08:26.920
What? Star, I was there
on Song Day.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.830
I know you're
with Marco now.

08:28.830 --> 08:30.380
Oh, Ruberiot.

08:30.380 --> 08:32.210
That song is gonna haunt me
for the rest of my life.

08:32.210 --> 08:35.460
No, no. It was
a huge wake-up call.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.210
I finally realized
you're not into me.

08:37.210 --> 08:39.670
So during the dance,
I wanted to do the right thing,

08:39.670 --> 08:41.500
and give you space.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.250
If you'd asked
to dance,

08:43.250 --> 08:44.420
I totally would've, but...

08:44.420 --> 08:46.380
I wanted it
to be your choice.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.420
Okay, first of all,
me and Marco, not a thing.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.500
- Hey, not the point.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.460
Second of all,
giving me space

08:52.460 --> 08:53.790
doesn't mean pretending
I don't exist.

08:53.790 --> 08:55.460
That's just rude.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.250
I was just trying
to do the right thing.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.790
It would've been nice if you
didn't ignore me all night.

08:59.790 --> 09:03.460
I don't know
how to be nice!

09:03.460 --> 09:05.710
At least give me
credit for trying.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.670
This wasn't easy.

09:12.330 --> 09:14.290
You're being
really dramatic.

09:14.290 --> 09:15.960
Whatever, Star.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.330
I was just trying
to give you what you want.

09:17.330 --> 09:19.380
This isn't what I want.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.710
KING: Look what you did!
You're paying for that chair!

09:24.710 --> 09:26.080
I'll pay for the chair
when you pay for

09:26.080 --> 09:27.710
all the damage
Toffee caused.

09:27.710 --> 09:30.000
I'm starting to rethink
being allies with your kingdom.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.670
Oh, why don't you just
crawl back into

09:31.670 --> 09:33.500
that little hole
you came out of?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.290
Please, everyone,
settle down.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.460
How could they let
that happen?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.290
Tom, may I have
this dance?

09:44.290 --> 09:45.500
I'd be delighted.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.420
Aw, look at 'em go.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.460
Um, Star?

10:39.460 --> 10:41.330
We should probably
stop dancing.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.500
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

10:44.750 --> 10:48.790
And this concludes
the Silver Bell Ball.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.710
Awwww.

11:01.710 --> 11:04.000
I forgot what
a good dancer you are.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.380
Yeah, thanks.

11:06.380 --> 11:10.420
So, um, would you
maybe wanna get
a corn shake or something?

11:10.420 --> 11:12.210
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

11:12.210 --> 11:13.580
I could do that.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.580
Beep beep.
Excuse us.

11:15.580 --> 11:17.380
Look at me, Star.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.500
Ooh, it's a new
club-snub record.
