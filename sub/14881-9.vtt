02:51.337 --> 02:52.238
I like green.

02:56.476 --> 02:59.746
I want green. I'm gonna go downstairs.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.665
<i>It's good. I'm chilling. Is Kim with you?</i>

06:06.632 --> 06:09.135
<i>Did you hear about that song</i>
<i>that Kanye released?</i>

06:10.136 --> 06:12.305
<i>The recording is so about you.</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:15.775
<i>And you just got flour-bombed.</i>
<i>This is hilarious.</i>

06:15.842 --> 06:18.311
<i>"â€¦my mink is dragging on the floor."</i>

06:35.428 --> 06:37.597
I went for the kiss,
and you went for the hug.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.820
<i>Hey, Khlo, it's Kim.
I'm here with Kourtney,</i>

08:07.887 --> 08:10.857
<i>and we're just calling you to say</i>
<i>we love you and we miss you.</i>

08:10.923 --> 08:12.425
<i>I feel like we took things too far.</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:17.096
<i>I love you and I want to see you.</i>
<i>Kardashians for life!</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:29.434
Did you play with it?

21:45.771 --> 21:46.738
I always do.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.535
I'm so annoyed with him.

24:20.258 --> 24:22.093
Whatever, it's fine.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.612
You look great.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.708
No, it's cool. It's all right.

36:02.460 --> 36:03.728
Looking good, Scott.

36:49.807 --> 36:51.142
So is this "Scott Takes New York?"

37:07.725 --> 37:09.360
Why doesn't a cocktail girl
come back here?

37:09.427 --> 37:11.596
Tell one guy
to let the cocktail waitress in.

37:11.662 --> 37:12.697
Everyone's dying.

37:40.658 --> 37:41.959
It looks amazing.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.016
Yeah, I got it from my boy in Japan.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.285
You know, I've never been to Japan.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.453
I got to take you then.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.875
Can we congratulate Scott,
if you don't mind?

39:56.761 --> 39:58.295
But is this a promise ring?

40:01.465 --> 40:02.333
We're not engaged?
