WEBVTT

00:23.257 --> 00:25.159
Guess what, guys?

00:25.193 --> 00:26.194
You're moving out? Nice.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.230
-I'll help you pack.
-I'm not moving out, fool.

00:29.263 --> 00:29.930
Aw.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.465
I found this box under my bed.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.068
Ooh, what is inside?

00:34.102 --> 00:35.035
It's a bunch of cool junk

00:35.069 --> 00:37.138
I've collected on missions
over the years.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.340
Ooh! Let's open it up, bro.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.213
ALL: Hat party!

00:47.415 --> 00:49.383
WOMAN: Hats!

00:49.417 --> 00:52.086
Huh. I was wondering
what happened to this.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.656
Finally free from that
wretched box.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.626
For your kindness,
I shall reward you
with immortality...

00:58.659 --> 01:01.129
Boring! What else is in there?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.130
Ooh! Shiny.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.632
I remember that bad boy.

01:07.168 --> 01:10.438
BEAST BOY: We just split Raven
into five versions of herself.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.243
One purple Raven coming up.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.211
-Think fast, mama!
-Ha!

01:24.885 --> 01:28.322
Hey, I wanted some
smoochie-smoochie!

01:28.356 --> 01:29.790
No smoochie-smoochies.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.126
This prism is
nothing but trouble.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.129
A person is greater
than the sum of their parts.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.698
We can't just split each other
into the parts we like.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.600
You take the good
with the bad.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.235
That's what friendship is.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.705
Then is it wrong for me
to like this Silkie the best?

01:44.738 --> 01:45.839
Absolutely.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.377
I feel the shame.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.313
Sure, I'd love to isolate
Raven's intensity,

01:52.346 --> 01:54.248
or Cyborg's determination.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.250
You like
something about me?

01:56.284 --> 01:58.152
Or Starfire's strength,

01:58.186 --> 02:01.189
or Beast Boy's, uh...

02:01.222 --> 02:02.423
I don't know.
What's his best trait?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.457
-Uh...

02:03.491 --> 02:04.725
Even his good stuff's awful.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.427
-I'm kinda hungry.
-Yeah, sure, that.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.562
And if I did isolate
your best traits

02:08.596 --> 02:10.198
I'd have the most elite

02:10.231 --> 02:12.233
and focused crime-fighting
team on the planet.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.735
And, yes, you'd all be
much less annoying,

02:14.768 --> 02:17.471
and, of course,
I could lead
more efficiently.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.208
In fact, it would be
a dream come true.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.944
But would we be
the Teen Titans? No.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.213
We would be better!

02:33.454 --> 02:35.723
Uh, what's going on?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.693
Tell me, Cyborg,

02:39.727 --> 02:43.564
have you ever wondered
why a gardener prunes a tree?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.299
Nope, but I like me
some prunes.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.367
Let's try that again.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.336
Tell me, Cyborg,

02:48.369 --> 02:51.239
why does the farmer separate
the wheat from the chaff?

02:51.272 --> 02:54.275
Beats me, but all this
food talk is making me hungry.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.476
Never mind.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.211
I'm going to use
the prism to divide

02:57.245 --> 02:59.380
you into the five core parts
of your personality,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.782
isolate the best
and ditch the rest.

03:01.815 --> 03:02.850
-No.

03:02.883 --> 03:03.884
Great!

03:06.420 --> 03:08.389
You wanna hear
something funny?

03:08.422 --> 03:10.791
No. You're the jokester
part of Cyborg.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.327
Well, I've got a joke.
Knock, knock.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.329
Who's there?

03:15.363 --> 03:16.464
Not you!

03:16.497 --> 03:18.632
So, what's your deal?

03:18.666 --> 03:21.235
Uh, I just wanna veg.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.603
Next!

03:22.636 --> 03:24.538
What is more important
in a battle,

03:24.572 --> 03:26.574
strength or strategy?

03:26.607 --> 03:27.941
They're both great!

03:27.975 --> 03:31.312
Ow! You're even louder
than regular Cyborg.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.514
Yes, I am, and I love it!

03:33.547 --> 03:36.016
Woo-hoo!
I said, "Woo-hoo!"

03:36.049 --> 03:39.353
Oh. You're his enthusiasm,
aren't you?

03:39.387 --> 03:41.955
You know it!
Boo-yah ska-doo!

03:41.989 --> 03:44.292
-Sir!
-Ooh! I like you already.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.995
Question. When entering
a hostile situation,
what's the first...

03:48.028 --> 03:48.962
Sir, scan the area.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.665
Target hostiles,
avoid civilians, destroy.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.034
And we have a winner!

03:54.067 --> 03:57.305
-But I haven't even...
-Nobody cares!

03:57.338 --> 04:00.408
-Sir, the five parts of
Beast Boy's personality

04:00.441 --> 04:01.809
seem to be more or less
the same, sir!

04:02.510 --> 04:04.445
-'Sup.
-Hey.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.447
Beast Boy is
a simple creature.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.716
No, we're all
completely different, bro.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.518
I'm a little hungrier
than these guys.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.821
I'm a little sleepy.
Ah, that said, I could eat.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.889
-Yeah, me too.
-Totes.

04:15.923 --> 04:16.790
What do you think?

04:16.824 --> 04:18.992
Sir, it is the opinion
of this soldier

04:19.026 --> 04:20.794
that they would
all be ineffective in
a combat scenario.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.331
However, one would be useful
as a human shield, sir!

04:26.367 --> 04:29.603
Cannon fodder, good idea.
Uh...

04:31.405 --> 04:32.873
-You.
-Sweet.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.683
Let's take the purple one.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.518
I like the way
she's looking at me.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.086
Absolutely not.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.388
Aw...

04:50.791 --> 04:52.993
-I like the angry one, sir.
-Agreed.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.901
Show me
to the field of battle.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.703
This one would make
a great hero, sir!

05:02.736 --> 05:05.439
Not bad, but I'd like to
speak to the rest.

05:05.473 --> 05:09.410
For Star, I'm looking for
someone who can
demonstrate commitment...

05:09.443 --> 05:10.744
To our team.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.614
Starfires, will you marry me?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.082
Any of you?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.417
-No.
-No!

05:16.450 --> 05:18.686
No.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.954
-No.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.792
-Yes!

05:24.825 --> 05:28.529
I once wore the
tuna salad as a hat.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.799
Barbarian Starfire it is.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.902
Look at this
beautiful new team.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.472
Sir, may I drop
and give you 20, sir?

05:38.506 --> 05:40.007
Go nuts.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.877
I hate introductions!

05:43.911 --> 05:44.978
Noted.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.384
I will bathe in the blood
of my enemies.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.019
Love the enthusiasm!

05:52.052 --> 05:53.687
And Beast Boy,

05:53.721 --> 05:55.489
the Human Shield!

05:55.523 --> 05:57.658
What? Ow!

05:57.691 --> 05:59.493
-Crime alert.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.464
Sir, awaiting your
command, sir!

06:05.132 --> 06:07.134
That's everything
I've always wanted.

06:07.167 --> 06:07.968
Titans, go!

06:08.001 --> 06:10.170
Moving to position!
Covering fire!

06:10.203 --> 06:11.472
Double Delta formation.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.610
You all
make me so mad!

06:24.618 --> 06:28.188
Why do I have to be
the Human Shield?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.423
Ow!

06:30.157 --> 06:31.925
Dang, I'm good.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.095
What a team!

06:35.128 --> 06:38.499
Although I do miss
the fun-loving Cyborg,

06:38.532 --> 06:39.533
and the sweet Starfire.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.470
Raven always
wonderfully enigmatic.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.539
Beast Boy...
Was more or less the same.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.740
What have I done?

06:46.774 --> 06:48.876
Oh, that's right.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.480
I just formed the best
superhero team ever.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.147
Sorry, Justice League!

06:55.549 --> 06:56.884
Sir, yes, sir!

06:56.917 --> 06:58.986
-I'm dancing.

06:59.019 --> 06:59.853
Watch out.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.622
Sir. Permission to
speak freely, sir?

07:01.655 --> 07:03.591
Permission granted.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.460
Sir. I could watch you
dance all night. Sir!

07:06.494 --> 07:08.028
You guys are the best.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.864
In fact, the only way I could
create a better team...

07:10.898 --> 07:14.768
Whoa, is if I divided
myself into five parts.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.505
New plan!

07:19.272 --> 07:21.041
Robin, what're you doing?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.577
Don't you think you've
taken this too far?

07:23.611 --> 07:24.912
Not far enough.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.748
Think of it.
Five Robins on one team.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.550
Each with his own strength.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.019
Huh. I wonder what
my five core traits are.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.122
Heroic, confident, fearless.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.559
Is handsome
a personality trait?

07:38.592 --> 07:40.027
Only one way to find out.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.499
Not five Robins.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.570
-Ugh!

07:49.603 --> 07:52.239
Oh, no, it's his craziness.

07:52.272 --> 07:55.843
Gotta be perfect.
Gotta be perfect.
Gotta be perfect.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.812
Oh, no. Perfectionist.
He's the worst.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.148
Perfect, perfect,
perfect, perfect!

08:01.181 --> 08:02.616
I know it was you.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.284
You're the one. Now talk.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.218
Talk!

08:05.252 --> 08:08.188
This must represent
his obsessive side.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.557
I'm not obsessive,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.124
I'm detail-oriented.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.561
That's what makes me
a great detective.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.962
Talk!

08:14.995 --> 08:16.864
They're
all against me.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.198
They're all against me.
Get away.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.633
Get away, get away,
get away, get away!

08:19.667 --> 08:22.235
I'd recognize
that paranoia anywhere.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.171
Titans, go! Go!

08:24.204 --> 08:25.839
Why isn't anyone going?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.808
Listen to me!

08:27.841 --> 08:29.777
And the control freak, check.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.312
Yep, I know these guys
very well.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.315
We must get the Robins
back in the prism.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.584
Never!

08:36.617 --> 08:37.685
Aah!

08:37.718 --> 08:39.587
You'll never combine us now!

08:47.695 --> 08:48.996
Help us, Silkies.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.731
You are our only hope.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.423
Hi-yah!

09:54.294 --> 09:55.295
Obey!

10:04.938 --> 10:07.307
Sorry about that, guys.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.343
I really thought
my core personality
traits would be cooler.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.278
It's like you said,

10:11.311 --> 10:13.681
"You're greater than
the sum of your parts."

10:13.714 --> 10:15.082
We all are.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.085
Not all of us.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.788
Mmm. Hey there.
