- What am I looking at?
- On the wall behind her.

23:37.937 --> 23:41.148
- The Pissarro.
- This was taken at their house

23:41.190 --> 23:44.610
- in Warsaw. Mid-1930s.
- So?

23:44.694 --> 23:48.948
My great-grandmother again.
With her father.

23:52.410 --> 23:54.954

23:54.996 --> 23:59.417
- My grandfather's great-grandfather.
- Camille Pissarro?

- So what happened?

this old family painting back?

stays when he comes to Berlin?

- If you want to see the painting again,

24:40.833 --> 24:43.460

I have a professional interest

24:43.502 --> 24:45.254

- Odds are, so do you.

I figure you've been
investigating this for some time.

24:53.554 --> 24:57.683
Poking around, asking questions.
They're gonna find out.

24:57.724 --> 25:00.102
Voros uses an apartment in Dahlem.

25:00.143 --> 25:03.730
It actually belongs to one
of his father's companies.

25:05.065 --> 25:06.650
Let's go.

I'm going to find it,

26:02.288 --> 26:05.208
and if you get in my way I'm going
to fucking kill you. Understand?

- That's not a good sign.
- Oh, God!

27:11.941 --> 27:14.068

27:14.110 --> 27:16.195
It means he stuck to his

He was telling the truth...
he had nothing to do with this.

- Yeah.

We better get out of here.

Now what?

27:47.392 --> 27:49.937
We still have the forgery.

27:51.688 --> 27:53.899
Why did you keep it?

27:53.941 --> 27:57.277
It's not paint by numbers. There
are only so many people around

27:57.319 --> 27:58.946
capable of doing something like that.

27:58.987 --> 28:03.992
We find the forger,
he'll lead us to the original.

28:04.034 --> 28:06.828
I have a friend who knows about
these things. His name's Ivon.

28:06.912 --> 28:10.624
I'll give him a call.

28:14.586 --> 28:17.964
Goren found the driver. He was
with the girl at her apartment.

28:19.341 --> 28:21.802
And then they lost them. Again.

28:24.304 --> 28:26.515
You keep disappointing me, Lara.

28:26.556 --> 28:29.017
We've got a lead

He owns a gallery called
The Culture Factory.

There's going to be some

He's working at an opening tonight.
We're going to meet him there.

29:17.899 --> 29:20.360
How long have you been
doing this kind of work?

29:20.401 --> 29:25.615
- A while.
- No wife? No family?

29:27.909 --> 29:33.664
- I like to keep things simple.
- Sounds kind of lonely.

29:33.706 --> 29:37.001
You didn't track that painting to
Voros with a simple internet search.

29:37.085 --> 29:40.630
I wish. Three years of my life

29:40.963 --> 29:42.298
spent in dusty archives all over Europe.

29:42.340 --> 29:47.011
When I started this,
I told myself it was for my grandfather.

29:47.053 --> 29:50.681
Sometimes I wonder why
I don't just walk away.

29:50.765 --> 29:53.643
Why don't you?

29:53.684 --> 29:55.436
Maybe it's because
I've been doing it so long

I don't know anything else.

Not exactly your kind
of crowd, I'm guessing.

30:18.417 --> 30:21.921
I'll see if I can find Ivon.
Try and stay out of trouble.

30:41.065 --> 30:43.275
The composition achieves
a very powerful, dissonant

30:43.317 --> 30:46.528
counterpoint, doesn't it?
Although I must admit,

30:46.570 --> 30:49.531
usually I prefer the early
Russian school of abstraction.

30:51.742 --> 30:55.162
When I was nine, I had my
first erection to a Kandinsky.

30:56.413 --> 31:00.209
In that case, I'll leave you to it.

31:08.926 --> 31:12.220

- Later. Come with me.

This is Pissarro.

31:59.392 --> 32:02.520
It's called
"The Street Beside the Lake in Winter".

32:02.562 --> 32:04.064

- That's what I was told.
- I don't know...

32:10.487 --> 32:14.282
This painting's been missing
for almost seventy years.

32:14.657 --> 32:17.410
Assume for the sake
of argument, the artist

32:17.452 --> 32:19.954
had the original to copy from.
Who could have done it?

32:19.996 --> 32:22.832
Not many people.

32:22.916 --> 32:28.087
This is first class work.
If I had to venture a guess, I'd say...

32:28.129 --> 32:32.133
Markov. Anton Markov.

32:32.175 --> 32:35.303
He's the best there is.
He's crazy as a loon,

this off, it would be him.

- I didn't have anything to do with this.
- Mr. Voros said otherwise.

All I did for him was I just
advised him that if he wanted

I could get a good price for it.
