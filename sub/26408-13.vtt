WEBVTT

01:52.930 --> 01:55.012
Ah. Remind me
to never do this again, huh?

01:55.070 --> 01:57.106
ERIC: I'll let Captain Edwards
know you don't approve

01:57.160 --> 01:59.287
of his damage lock-out chamber.

01:59.330 --> 02:01.150
I'm sure all the C95
of nuclear submarines

02:01.200 --> 02:04.203
have complaint boxes posted
outside their staterooms.

02:04.250 --> 02:08.209
Yeah. A lock-out chamber...

02:08.250 --> 02:10.901
it's like a five-star hotel _
compared to being In that thing,

02:10.950 --> 02:12.292
that's for sure.Yeah.

02:12.340 --> 02:15.127
How'd it go out there?It went swimmingly.

02:15.170 --> 02:16.512
Iranian cargo ship
exactly where Mandy

02:16.570 --> 02:18.083
said it was supposed to be.

02:18.130 --> 02:20.860
Ah, a successful special
reconnaissance in North Korea.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.137
TAKAHASHI: Sir,
tube four is depressurized

02:22.180 --> 02:23.693
and ready to unlock.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.650
ERIC: Very well, Petty
Officer Takahashi.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.268
Let's get Senior Chief Perry
the hell out of there.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.959
Aye, sir. Stand by.Roger that.

02:34.710 --> 02:35.756
Hi, Ray.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.358
That was unpleasant.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.583
I don't know about that. I mean,
swimming against current?

02:39.630 --> 02:40.881
That was unpleasant.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.714
How you holding up?

02:42.770 --> 02:44.249
I burned up my
air consumption.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.724
Was down to 35 bar of 02
before I lgkred back in.
o .

02:46.770 --> 02:49.022
Luclq for us, this sub's
gonna give us a lift

02:49.080 --> 02:51.162
back to our exfil boat.Can't be soon enough.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.462
Being in a sub's cramped
quarters, too many dudes,

02:53.520 --> 02:55.465
it's like living
in an underwater Y.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.737
I'm gonna leave you
in the capable hands

02:56.780 --> 02:58.168
of Petty Officer Takahashi

02:58.220 --> 03:00.780
here while I transfer
these photos over to Havoc.

03:00.830 --> 03:02.252
How long till we get
our last man out?

03:02.310 --> 03:03.789
Five minutes, sir.All right.

03:03.830 --> 03:06.048
Let's get Quinn and Spenser out,
stand by.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.091
Make a hole.

03:14.410 --> 03:16.401
Upladden

03:26.200 --> 03:27.929
Your swimmers recovered, sir?

03:27.990 --> 03:30.242
Yeah. Waiting on the tube
to depressurize

03:30.290 --> 03:32.338
so we can pull my last two men
out, Master Chief Wilke.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.336
Captain Edwards will
be happy to hear that.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.076
About time we got underway.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.200
Loitering in enemy territory

03:38.260 --> 03:40.945
is not my idea of
a good time, either.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.160
We floated
the communication buoy

03:42.220 --> 03:43.903
after we_ recovered
your first man.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.177
Radio's all yours.

03:45.220 --> 03:46.562
ET2 will upload your images.

03:50.090 --> 03:52.263
Would it kill 'em to put
a window in here?

03:52.310 --> 03:56.314
There's nothing to see
but black water this far down.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.580
They got it. Exactly where
we thought it would be.

04:02.630 --> 04:05.622
Yeah, pulled it off. Now they
just got to get out of there.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.329
Toughest thing in the world
is standing by

04:07.370 --> 04:09.509
while your team
works without you.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.029
Well, it makes it
a little bit easier

04:11.070 --> 04:12.503
knowing how much Sonny
hates the water.

04:12.550 --> 04:14.939
ERIC : Havoc Base,
this is Bravo Actual.

04:14.990 --> 04:16.332
Radio check. Over.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.291
Bravo Actual,
this is Havoc Base.

04:18.340 --> 04:19.944
We have you broken but readable.
How me?

04:19.990 --> 04:21.207
I have you same.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.218
I pass Rourke, Morrissey,
and Mars.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.386
How copy?

04:25.430 --> 04:26.954
That is a good copy.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.127
Any other message traffic
for this station at this time?

04:29.180 --> 04:31.432
Negative, Havoc. Just looking
forward to seeing the sun again.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.038
Roger that.

04:33.090 --> 04:35.786
Tell Bravo 3 to look out
for sharks. Havoc out.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.785
Monero, checklist.MONERO:
Yes, sir.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.058
Sir, they passed Morrissey.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.704
A|| swimmers are recovered
and on board

04:41.750 --> 04:43.536
the USS Booker T. Washington.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.797
Miss Ellis, how much longer can

04:44.840 --> 04:46.489
their exfil platform
hold on station?

04:46.540 --> 04:50.544
Uh, the Ang Paggisingcan
hold another four hours.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.148
Being this close
to North Korean waters,

04:52.200 --> 04:53.929
they'll definitely be
on DPRK's radar,

04:53.980 --> 04:56.198
but since this trawler
is known to fish the area,

04:56.250 --> 04:58.115
it shouldn't arouse suspicion.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.468
HARRINGTON:
Let's hope not.

04:59.510 --> 05:01.205
It's the only way
they're getting home.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.683
Lieutenant Commander,

05:02.730 --> 05:04.379
I understand your men
are recovered.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.603
Our last man should be
locking back in shortly.

05:06.650 --> 05:08.686
As far as we're concerned,
our work here is done.

05:08.740 --> 05:09.991
Not soon enough.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.996
With 155 souls on board,
I have no desire

05:12.050 --> 05:13.563
to stay longer than we have to.

05:13.610 --> 05:16.078
Master Chief, make your heading
two-seven-zero

05:16.140 --> 05:17.562
and make turns for 30 knots.

05:17.620 --> 05:20.009
Two-seven-zero, make turns
for 30 knots. Aye, sir.

05:20.050 --> 05:22.439
Petty Officer Jones, make your
heading two-seven-zero

05:22.490 --> 05:24.048
and turn for 30 knots.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.884
Let's go, Ponyboy.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.714
Get on out of there.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.977
Grab my rifle?

05:35.030 --> 05:37.282
Yep.
Thanks.

05:37.330 --> 05:39.321
Fins.

05:43.860 --> 05:46.078
Oh, boy. I feel like I just
relived my own birth.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.382
That was really just awful.Yeah.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.125
I bet Sonny's miserable.

05:49.170 --> 05:50.296
Oh, he's got to be losing
his claustrophobic mind

05:50.350 --> 05:51.681
right about now.Right?

05:51.740 --> 05:52.957
How much longer
until he comes out?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.126
Uh, two minutes.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.479
Two minutes?

05:58.180 --> 05:59.397
JASON:
Give him a call, Clay.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.396
See how he's holding up.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.169
Bravo 3, this is Bravo 6, uh,

06:03.230 --> 06:04.959
we're requesting an update
of your current position.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.837
Bravo 3, this is Bravo 2.

06:11.890 --> 06:14.586
Radio check. Over.

06:14.630 --> 06:18.327
You changed locations?

06:18.370 --> 06:20.326
Hey, Sonny, this is Jason.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.506
I bet right about now
you're regretting

06:21.550 --> 06:23.029
doing all those squats, huh?

06:23.070 --> 06:26.244
All, uh, snug as a bug in there?

06:28.770 --> 06:30.203
SONNY :
Kiss my waterlogged Texas ass.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.854
There it is.

06:31.910 --> 06:34.424
Hey, at least there was no
sharks in there, brother, right?

06:34.480 --> 06:38.439
I'll tell you what, man, I'd
rather take a swim with the man

06:38.480 --> 06:41.825
in the gray suit
any day over sitting in here.

06:41.870 --> 06:45.966
I feel like I'm on the business
end of a clogged toilet.

06:46.010 --> 06:49.741
Hey, maybe you should've
let Trent take your place.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.270
This op wins the Sonny Quinn
nightmare mission award.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.276
Swimming? Check.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.878
Freezing? Check.

06:56.930 --> 06:59.455
Climbing over sharp
volcanic rock? That's a check.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.456
Didn't get shot at? Check.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.456
Now, last but not least,
sitting in a tube

07:03.510 --> 07:06.149
that's tighter
than Shamu's keister?

07:06.200 --> 07:08.156
Check.You got to give it to him, man.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.461
He's a world-class complainer.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.114
Nobody does it better.Nuh-uh.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.639
Master Chief, we're ready here.We're ready?

07:12.690 --> 07:13.850
Hey, Sonny, we're ready.

07:13.910 --> 07:15.719
But, yeah,
before we open you up,

07:15.780 --> 07:17.384
you sure you don't want to spend
a little bit more time in there

07:17.430 --> 07:18.988
and do a little bit
of self-reflecting?

07:19.040 --> 07:22.089
I will self-reflect
all over your damn face,

07:22.130 --> 07:23.859
you don't pull me
out of this damn thing.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.138
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.136
Whoa.

07:28.180 --> 07:29.090
RAY:
Hey.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.399
What's happening?I don't know, Master Chief.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.008
What do you mean you don't know?

07:36.060 --> 07:37.357
Hey, I got a guy in here!

07:38.800 --> 07:40.188
The locking mechanism
isn't working.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.662
What do you mean the locking
mechanism isn't working?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.199
I got a guy stuck in there.

07:47.980 --> 07:49.629
What the hell's
going on out there?

07:49.680 --> 07:51.807
Hey, Sonny, I got some bad news.

07:51.860 --> 07:53.589
You're stuck.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.033
Right there, more...Come on, come on.

08:03.740 --> 08:07.779
The thing ain't moving, boss.

08:07.830 --> 08:11.129
SONNY: My grandninny
taught me two things:

08:11.180 --> 08:13.398
never wear your dirty boots
across her clean-ass floor,

08:13.440 --> 08:15.613
and never beat a joke to death.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.833
Let me out.

08:17.880 --> 08:21.407
Uh, it's no joke. Sonny,
the submarine's powered down.

08:21.450 --> 08:22.849
The latch is stuck.

08:22.890 --> 08:24.846
Just need to sit tight.: Yeah.

08:24.890 --> 08:28.018
Tight's about
all I can do in here.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.637
JASON:
Master Chief,

08:30.680 --> 08:31.931
something's wrong
with the torpedo tube.

08:31.980 --> 08:33.538
Latch is stuck.
It's not opening.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.374
Yeah, we've experienced
a power surge from the reactor

08:35.420 --> 08:37.502
that somehow shorted
the locking mech.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.721
Weapons is working with
engineering right now.Got a time frame?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.941
I'm headed to control
to speak with the captain
and figure that out.

08:41.990 --> 08:44.550
You mind if I come?
That's one of my men in there.

08:44.610 --> 08:46.953
Don't mind, but, Master Chief,
we're working the problem,

08:47.000 --> 08:48.558
and getting this boat up
and running takes priority

08:48.610 --> 08:50.566
over one sailor's discomfort.Right.

08:50.610 --> 08:52.396
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.305
For once, Sonny has
a right to complain.

08:54.350 --> 08:56.398
Being stuck in that tube
is a whole new level of suck.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.523
This mean we can't mess
With him anymore?

08:59.580 --> 09:01.662
Oh, hell no.
Want to keep his mind occupied.

09:03.230 --> 09:05.494
See what I mean?

09:05.540 --> 09:09.533
How do you keep
that mind occupied?

09:09.590 --> 09:12.058
Sonny, anything
but that song, please.

09:19.550 --> 09:22.201
Look, did I nearly
pop that NK soldier

09:22.250 --> 09:23.774
just to keep my ears
from bleeding, man?

09:25.390 --> 09:27.642
Only the Beatles
have sold more albums

09:27.690 --> 09:30.420
than the legendary Garth Brooks.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.129
You're on the wrong side
of history, boys.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.568
Yeah, happily so.

09:36.050 --> 09:39.565
Hey, fellas, it's, uh,
getting a little tight in here.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.396
My skin's starting to crawl.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.662
CLAY:
Hey, it's just like BUD/S,

09:45.710 --> 09:48.224
out there freezing
in the surf, man.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.180
Focus on something else
to keep your mind off it.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.322
Oh, yeah, I hated BUD/S.

09:52.370 --> 09:55.544
You know,
I used to make a bucket list.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.546
Things I want to do
before I die.

09:57.590 --> 10:01.196
Yeah, I, I had a bucket list.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.979
Yeah? What'd you have on it?

10:03.030 --> 10:04.986
I can't remember.

10:05.030 --> 10:09.592
I scrapped it once I found out
about the SEAL Teams.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.606
Hoo-yah.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.828
Master Chief Wilke,
glad you made it.

10:14.870 --> 10:16.565
WILKE: Captain, we have an
issue in the torpedo room

10:16.610 --> 10:17.918
I needed to update WEPS on.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.609
Talk to me, Master Chief.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.220
One of the SEALs is
trapped in a torpedo tube.

10:22.270 --> 10:23.567
Petty Officer Sonny Quinn.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.349
It seems
the power surge froze

10:25.400 --> 10:27.527
the locking mechanism
as it was mid-throw.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.184
Just spoke with the weapons
division officer,

10:29.230 --> 10:30.481
and he's putting a
team together now.

10:32.410 --> 10:34.970
Very well.
I don't believe we've met yet.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.671
Yeah. Captain, this is
Bravo Team's leader...

10:37.720 --> 10:39.233
Mas...Master Chief Jason Hayes.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.190
Submarines are a strange
animal, Master Chief.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.026
Everything down here has
a way of amplifying itself

10:43.070 --> 10:44.799
the more stressful things get.

10:44.860 --> 10:47.078
Which is why I'm worried about
my man trapped in that tube.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.429
Need him out now.

10:49.470 --> 10:51.370
I understand he's your priority.

10:51.430 --> 10:52.556
He's not mine.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.511
Mine is to get
this boat operational

10:54.560 --> 10:55.993
and get out
of North Korean waters.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.167
Since your man's situation
isn't life-threatening,

10:58.220 --> 10:59.562
he's gonna have to stand by.

10:59.610 --> 11:03.523
ERIC:
Master Chief Hayes?

11:03.570 --> 11:06.300
May I have a
word with you?

11:10.580 --> 11:12.571
Told you to stay put
in the torpedo room.

11:12.620 --> 11:15.623
This isn't the command;
this is a nuke-powered sub

11:15.670 --> 11:17.103
in the regular Navy.

11:17.150 --> 11:18.401
All right,
we're guests here.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.666
Understand?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.541
How bad off are we?

11:22.590 --> 11:24.103
The reactor that runs
the sub is fine.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.458
But the propulsion system
is down.

11:26.510 --> 11:29.468
We are dead in the water
until they can get It up onllne.

11:29.510 --> 11:31.501
You ever see this before?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.460
Not in my 24 years in the Navy.

11:33.510 --> 11:35.205
Well, I guess
that's some relief.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.558
Don't know how good
it is for Sonny, though.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.942
I understand.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.343
But the captain has made
his priorities clear.

11:40.390 --> 11:43.518
This is a_
strategic-level Issue.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.730
All right?

11:44.790 --> 11:46.348
Let's let the crew work
the problem;

11:46.400 --> 11:47.526
it's their boat.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.049
Captain Edwards
is making the right call.

11:49.090 --> 11:50.261
Right call?
Yeah.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.527
Be sure to tell
Sonny that.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.786
Jason.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.799
It is the right call.

11:58.890 --> 12:01.233
Forgive Master Chief
Hayes's bearing.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.145
He's used to fixing
any problems

12:03.200 --> 12:05.839
that come his
way... hIS way.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.414
One of my sailors
in there...

12:07.460 --> 12:09.371
I'd feel the_
same way, snr.

12:12.380 --> 12:13.893
ERIC :
Power's coming back on.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.248
The propulsion system's
sobeare is rebooting.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.336
Bravo 3 is still locked
in the torpedo tube.

12:18.380 --> 12:21.167
Break. Recommending push
our timeline 30 mikes right.

12:21.210 --> 12:22.472
How copy?

12:22.520 --> 12:25.250
I copy. Push timeline
3O mikes right. Havoc out.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.346
Miss Ellis, is that a problem?

12:26.390 --> 12:28.301
No, sir.
I will make sure the trawler

12:28.350 --> 12:29.521
is aware of the issues
and accommodates.

12:29.570 --> 12:30.821
DAVIS:
Hey, Trent.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.780
Can Sonny breathe
down there?

12:32.830 --> 12:34.388
As long as they pressurized
the tube

12:34.440 --> 12:37.523
and the water was forced back
out to sea, he's fine.

12:37.580 --> 12:38.706
Just got to let some air out

12:38.750 --> 12:40.183
of his rig
every once and a while.

12:40.230 --> 12:41.709
He's just getting
a little froggy.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.449
Aye, sir. Secured
for general quarters.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.058
Sir, we have most of the systems

12:49.110 --> 12:50.418
_back online _
outSIde of propulsron.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.849
Engineering officer says
it's a matter of minutes.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.118
Does that include the locks
on the torpedo tubes?

12:55.160 --> 12:56.548
Should be up and running.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.330
Let's get the
lieutenant commander's man out.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.425
Sir, we've run the bypass,
but it's still frozen.

13:03.470 --> 13:05.426
Master Chief, I've run down
the line of fixes for this.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.641
I'm gonna have to talk
to the XO about

13:07.690 --> 13:10.250
a more aggressive solution.Let's just cut this thing open.

13:10.310 --> 13:12.210
I could grind it out.All right, I like this kid.

13:12.260 --> 13:14.876
We need the skipper to sign off;
he might want us to keep working

13:14.920 --> 13:16.649
for a solution.Well, if we miss
our exfil window,

13:16.700 --> 13:19.260
we might end up joining you
for the rest of your deployment.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.402
Grab a tool kit and a grinder
and stand by for my word.

13:26.450 --> 13:28.054
All right,
Master Chief.Now we're moving, huh?

13:28.110 --> 13:30.101
I'll talk to the captain
about cutting your man out.

13:30.150 --> 13:32.106
JASON: Good, now we're
getting somewhere.

13:32.150 --> 13:34.027
SONNY:
Someone doesn't tell me

13:34.070 --> 13:35.458
what's going on out there,

13:35.510 --> 13:37.068
I'm gonna start singing.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.409
Yeah, they're talking about
doing a mechanical breach

13:41.470 --> 13:43.597
to get you out, Sonny.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.244
Come on, let's go.
Start cutting.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.074
I have to stand by
until word comes down

13:47.130 --> 13:48.427
that I'm allowed to cut.You're kidding me.

13:48.470 --> 13:49.732
Rules and
regulations here?

13:49.780 --> 13:51.509
Welcome back
to the regular Naw.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.346
The captain is concerned
about damaging the tube

13:53.390 --> 13:54.823
and limiting
our combat readiness.

13:54.870 --> 13:57.691
You got to be kidding me.It's Captain Edwards' boat.

13:57.740 --> 14:00.698
It's his call.Fine, I'll just go talk
to the captain myself.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.389
No, Master Chief, you will not.

14:03.450 --> 14:05.224
You will stay
here and wait

14:05.270 --> 14:07.352
until the man
that the United States Navy

14:07.410 --> 14:09.219
has given command
of a billion-dollar boat to

14:09.280 --> 14:11.316
decides that he wants
to talk to you,

14:11.370 --> 14:14.669
and if and when
that ever happens,

14:14.720 --> 14:16.847
you will address him
as a senior enlisted sailor

14:16.890 --> 14:18.369
as required to.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.842
Am I clear?

14:19.900 --> 14:21.765
Crystal.

14:21.810 --> 14:25.507
I will speak
to Captain Edwards myself.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.030
All of you
will stay here until I get back.

14:32.430 --> 14:34.034
Up ladder, make a hole.

14:36.870 --> 14:38.952
SONNY:
You boys there?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.561
I think I got a little bit
of a problem.

14:42.620 --> 14:43.826
What is it, Sonny?

14:43.880 --> 14:46.007
Okay, well,
remember in Star Wars

14:46.050 --> 14:48.701
where Luke Skywalker and Chewie,
Han Solo and Princess Leia,

14:48.750 --> 14:51.059
they jumped down
that Death Star garbage chute?

14:51.100 --> 14:53.409
And th-they think
it's pretty bad.

14:53.450 --> 14:56.578
Then, all of a sudden,
uh, it gets worse?

14:56.630 --> 14:59.019
What are you getting at, Sonny?

15:01.070 --> 15:03.846
The tube's filling up
with water.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.889
Fast.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.084
EDWARDS:
Enter.

15:17.130 --> 15:19.030
Blackburn.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.819
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

15:20.870 --> 15:23.600
There's been a change in
Petty Officer Quinn's situation.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.082
I suppose you're not here
to tell me

15:25.140 --> 15:26.823
he's out of the tube,
enjoying a hot cup of coffee?

15:26.880 --> 15:28.836
Negative, sir, water is
leaking into the tube.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.222
Requesting permission

15:30.270 --> 15:32.830
to use the grinder
to cut it open.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.836
That torpedo tube
enables me to keep

15:34.890 --> 15:36.755
my sailors and my boat safe.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.667
I cannot, in good conscience,
diminish our combat readiness

15:39.720 --> 15:41.665
when we still have two months
of a deployment In front of us.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.199
Yeah, I understand that, sir.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.231
Even down one torpedo tube,
this is still

15:45.290 --> 15:47.679
one of the most lethal boats
in the water.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.019
My primary mission as
C0 of the Washington

15:51.080 --> 15:53.719
is to fulfill the third
arm of the nuclear triad.

15:53.770 --> 15:55.772
Fact is, your
mission, your men,

15:55.820 --> 15:58.596
even my men, are
secondary to that charge.

15:58.650 --> 15:59.992
Yes, sir.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.565
But with all due respect, sir,

16:02.610 --> 16:04.999
the government, our government,
has spent years

16:05.050 --> 16:07.655
and millions of dollars training
Petty Officer Quinn

16:07.700 --> 16:09.213
to conduct _
the dangerous operations

16:09.270 --> 16:11.693
that ensure that this boat
never has to fulfill that role.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.676
Name that tune, Ken Doll.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.325
CLAY: I'd rather drink
a Yoo-hoo and ketchup smoothie

16:29.370 --> 16:31.019
than listen to that
freaking norse, man.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.154
How you doing in there, buddy?

16:35.210 --> 16:38.589
Oh, little old me
is just peachy.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.642
I've got a joke for you.

16:40.690 --> 16:42.032
Okay, you ready?

16:42.080 --> 16:44.685
How many Germans
does it take to, uh...

16:44.740 --> 16:47.436
screw in a light bulb?

16:47.480 --> 16:48.640
One.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.088
You know why?

16:50.130 --> 16:52.348
'Cause they are efficient

16:52.400 --> 16:54.436
and they don't have
a sense of humor.

16:54.490 --> 16:56.173
That's good.

16:56.230 --> 16:57.618
No.

16:57.660 --> 16:58.968
That's not very funny.

16:59.010 --> 17:02.138
That's pretty damn funny, man.

17:02.190 --> 17:03.578
At least he's
still laughing.

17:03.630 --> 17:05.530
WILKE: Captain Edwards
has authorized the use of tools

17:05.580 --> 17:06.979
_ to extract
Petty Officer Qumn.Here we go.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.362
A|| right.Let's cut this thing open.

17:08.410 --> 17:09.809
Sonny, we're cutting
you out, brother.

17:09.850 --> 17:12.546
Cut him out, let's
go. Hurry up.

17:18.730 --> 17:21.073
Amen.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.384
Amen.

17:23.430 --> 17:26.251
I got friends in

17:26.300 --> 17:27.517
Low places, where...

17:27.560 --> 17:29.084
1MC:
A|| hands man battle stations.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.170
A|| hands man battle stations.

17:32.220 --> 17:34.176
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. What'd
you stop cutting for? Hey.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.745
Chief of the Boat,
report to the conn immediately.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.223
That can't be good.

17:40.140 --> 17:43.405
Oh, well, that's...

17:43.450 --> 17:46.180
Hey, fellas, it's, uh, gotten
awful quiet out there.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.016
Want to tell me
what the hell's gonng on?

17:48.060 --> 17:50.528
All right, you know
what? I'm gonna find out.

17:50.590 --> 17:51.534
Blackburn warned you
about stepping foot

17:51.590 --> 17:52.887
in control, brother.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.976
I'm sick and tired of
being a passenger, Ray.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.801
What have you got?

17:59.860 --> 18:01.509
I got a, uh, Romeo-class sub

18:01.550 --> 18:06.556
bearing zero-one-zero,
15 knots at 15,000 yards, sir.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.727
Keep tracking her.
Designate her Master One.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.168
Conduct an
all-sensors search

18:10.210 --> 18:12.292
for other submersed threat
platforms In the area.

18:12.350 --> 18:13.601
Aye, Captain.

18:13.650 --> 18:15.561
Told you
to keep out of here.

18:15.610 --> 18:18.135
Yeah, well, things are
getting serious down there.Well, up here, too.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.171
North Korean sub just
showed up on sonar.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.006
They out hunting
or they just out for a stroll?

18:22.050 --> 18:24.962
Don't put much stock
in coincidence.

18:25.010 --> 18:26.181
We can't cut your man out

18:26.230 --> 18:27.925
until that sub moves
out of sonar range.

18:27.970 --> 18:29.756
Okay, but that tube is
filling with water.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.973
Sonny is gonna be in trouble
if we don't get him out.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.362
We're going to go
from patrol quiet

18:33.410 --> 18:35.014
to silent running soon.

18:35.070 --> 18:37.322
North Koreans hear power tools,
we start trading torpedoes,

18:37.370 --> 18:38.587
the whole world's
gonna be In trouble.

18:38.630 --> 18:40.063
That tube is
filling with water

18:40.110 --> 18:43.159
and I got a
man in that...Master Chief.

18:46.770 --> 18:48.112
RAY: Getting quiet
in there, brother.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.593
You good?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.869
No offense here, Perry,

18:55.910 --> 18:58.378
but I'd much rather hear
the sound of the grinder

18:58.440 --> 19:00.089
than your voice.

19:00.130 --> 19:03.748
We're running quiet until
a North Korean sub moves off.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.659
Oh, this is perfect.

19:06.710 --> 19:10.441
I survived the whole damn
War on Terror,

19:10.490 --> 19:12.708
but snapping pics
of some stupid boat

19:12.760 --> 19:15.058
is gonna do me in.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.101
Stop that, brother.

19:17.150 --> 19:19.710
Can't let those thoughts
creep in.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.025
Yeah.

19:23.070 --> 19:25.197
Maybe this is the Almighty
getting back at me

19:25.250 --> 19:28.242
for all the bad things
I've done.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.682
No, man, it's just...
it's just bad luck.

19:36.690 --> 19:39.420
Do your old buddy a favor there?

19:39.480 --> 19:42.256
Say a prayer for me?
Help me get out of this mess?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.049
Yeah, sure thing, brother.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.318
Never did I think once,
when we met,

19:54.360 --> 19:57.966
that'd I'd be asking you
to pray for me.

19:58.020 --> 19:59.920
You know?

19:59.980 --> 20:02.881
I mean, nobody closed down
more bars,

20:02.940 --> 20:06.717
crushed more skulls
than Ray Perry back in the day.

20:08.380 --> 20:11.156
Yeah, well, howling at the moon
is in my rearview.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.940
You know, Naima made
damn sure of that.

20:13.990 --> 20:15.946
Yeah, truth is, though,
Ray, I...

20:17.300 --> 20:19.120
I always admired that.

20:19.170 --> 20:21.479
You know, the ability
to balance

20:21.520 --> 20:24.774
operating and,
and a happy home life.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.778
Just don't see that in me.

20:31.270 --> 20:32.828
Sure you do, brother.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.137
You just haven't found
that right person

20:36.190 --> 20:38.055
to help you realize it.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.536
MANDY: Just got an update
from Blackburn.

20:43.590 --> 20:44.921
Yeah?

20:44.980 --> 20:47.494
There's a_North Korean sub
patrol|Ing In the area.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.199
So they can't extract Sonny
until the enemy sub

20:49.240 --> 20:51.105
is out of range.That's not all.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.765
What?
Water's now leaking
into the tube

20:53.810 --> 20:55.766
from the outer hatch,
which is also stuck.

20:55.810 --> 20:57.289
Sonny is gonna be
in big trouble

20:57.340 --> 20:58.944
if they can't
get to him soon.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.298
He'll be fine.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.069
Jason and the boys
are gonna work the problem.

21:05.610 --> 21:07.566
SONAR TECHNICIAN:
Master One Romeo submarine.

21:07.610 --> 21:09.214
Bearing three-four-zero.

21:09.260 --> 21:12.263
14,000 yards... and opening.

21:12.310 --> 21:14.358
Enemy boat's almost
out of range, Captain.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.789
Permission to continue
extractIng our guest.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.445
They're changing course
too often to take the chance.

21:19.490 --> 21:21.355
Silent running
will remain in place

21:21.410 --> 21:23.139
until they're beyond
the counter detection range.

21:23.190 --> 21:25.010
Captain's gonna
get Sonny killed.

21:25.060 --> 21:26.971
Yeah, well,
he's got bigger issues.

21:27.020 --> 21:28.237
We got to work the problem.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.588
There's nothing to work.

21:29.630 --> 21:31.188
This is not our place.Hel| there isn't.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.800
Sir, one of my men may
drown in your torpedo tube,

21:33.850 --> 21:34.976
and you're more concerned
about doing things

21:35.030 --> 21:36.418
by the book than saving him?

21:36.460 --> 21:37.859
You're out of line, Jason.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.948
Chief of the Boat feels
the sub is far enough away

21:39.990 --> 21:41.594
so we can start
cuttIng agaIn.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.688
Master Chief Wilke,
unless Master Chief Hayes

21:43.730 --> 21:46.335
_ leaves the control_room
ImmedIately, I want hIm cuffed,

21:46.390 --> 21:48.642
forcibly removed,
and detained

21:48.690 --> 21:50.385
until further notice.Aye, aye, Captain.

21:50.430 --> 21:53.342
You're no good to Sonny
in confinement, Jason.

21:53.390 --> 21:57.008
I'll get out of your way, sir.So you know,

21:57.050 --> 21:59.917
I admire your dedication,

21:59.970 --> 22:03.349
but_the chain of command
eXIsts for many reasons.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.665
One reason: _the hardest decision
an ofﬁcer can make

22:06.710 --> 22:10.589
is to sacrifice a life
to preserve the greater good.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.495
But when faced
with such a choice,

22:12.540 --> 22:14.974
things must be done by the book

22:15.020 --> 22:16.931
to remove emo_tion
from the equatIon.

22:16.980 --> 22:20.984
Because as you well know,
emotion clouds judgment.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.898
I understand, sir.

22:36.220 --> 22:37.699
Hey, things are
looking up, Sonny.

22:37.740 --> 22:41.949
Clay's got
your luclq hat.

22:42.010 --> 22:43.261
I'll wear an Oklahoma hat

22:43.310 --> 22:45.312
for the rest of my days,
you get me out of here.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.146
Any news?

22:52.190 --> 22:54.977
Nothing good.

22:57.150 --> 23:00.108
Hey. I think now
would be a good time

23:00.160 --> 23:01.969
for Sonny to hear
from his team leader.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.069
You all right, Sonny?

23:12.690 --> 23:16.296
I'm feeling better
now that Batman's shown up.

23:16.350 --> 23:19.911
You, uh... you gonna save my ass

23:19.960 --> 23:21.518
like you always do, Jace?

23:21.570 --> 23:23.959
Yeah.

23:24.010 --> 23:27.138
Gonna get you
out of here real soon.

23:27.180 --> 23:29.136
And we're gonna be laughing
about this over beers.

23:29.190 --> 23:32.057
Oh, yeah, sounds good.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.089
Some tequila,

23:33.150 --> 23:35.835
cervezas, chips, and guacamole.

23:35.890 --> 23:37.755
Maybe a little repeat
performance of Vegas

23:37.800 --> 23:39.051
with that little spider monkey.

23:39.110 --> 23:40.270
JASON:
Yeah, that's for sure, huh?

23:40.330 --> 23:41.672
I remember that night.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.678
Maxed out your government
credit cards on lappers.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.119
Still don't know how you managed

23:46.160 --> 23:49.891
not to get kicked out
of the Naw.

23:49.950 --> 23:53.374
You got nine lives, brother.

23:53.430 --> 23:54.647
Yeah.

23:54.690 --> 23:58.126
Yeah, Ijust...

23:58.170 --> 24:00.161
I'm hoping they didn't run out.

24:00.220 --> 24:01.949
Hey, don't worry
about it.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.560
We're gonna get you
outsoon.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.955
Hey, Jace?

24:08.010 --> 24:10.399
Yeah, I'm here, Sonny.

24:13.580 --> 24:16.959
You got to hurry, buddy.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.090
Please, man, I...

24:22.110 --> 24:24.328
I'm... I'm scared.

24:35.730 --> 24:37.243
Look, how are we supposed
to solve a problem

24:37.300 --> 24:38.904
they won't even
let us fix?

24:38.950 --> 24:41.737
It's against everything we do,
man. Hurry up and wait.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.340
SONNY: A thousand ways to die
in our line of work,

24:44.390 --> 24:48.736
and the only one I'm afraid of
is drowning.

24:48.790 --> 24:51.953
It's gonna be
a horrible way to go.

24:52.010 --> 24:56.959
Can't let him talk like that.
Keep him upbeat. Talk to him.

24:57.010 --> 24:58.796
Drowning? Sonny, come on, man.

24:58.840 --> 25:02.367
Thought that, uh, thought sharks
were at the top of that list.

25:02.410 --> 25:05.709
I'd love_ to see a shark
rIght now.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.718
Means I'd be
the hell out of here.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.103
Look, man, I think-- You know,
we got some positive stuff

25:11.160 --> 25:13.503
to take away from this, right?
I mean, maybe this is gonna,

25:13.550 --> 25:15.802
maybe this is gonna rid you
of your fear of sharks

25:15.860 --> 25:17.418
and water and, you
know, all that stuff.

25:17.470 --> 25:21.463
Sharks, yeah.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.329
Not water.

25:26.610 --> 25:31.434
The tube's... the tube's
about half full of water.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.436
I'm gonna have to go
to my Draeger soon.

25:34.480 --> 25:37.392
I'm hunting for air right now.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.705
Hey, easy, easy, brother, okay?
Just calm down, all right?

25:40.750 --> 25:41.967
Stay calm.

25:42.010 --> 25:46.834
Listen to me, boys,
I need you...

25:46.890 --> 25:49.017
I need you to get me
out of here, Clay.

25:49.060 --> 25:52.234
Okay? I can't breathe.
Get me out.

25:52.280 --> 25:55.067
Get me... Get me out of here!

25:55.110 --> 25:59.410
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here! Aah!

26:00.950 --> 26:04.647
Like, how much air do you think
he has in his rebreather?

26:04.690 --> 26:07.295
I checked my gauge earlier. I
had 30 bars, say, ten minutes.

26:07.340 --> 26:08.819
How much distance
do we need

26:08.870 --> 26:10.735
between us and the NK sub
until we can start cutting?

26:10.780 --> 26:12.691
It's about eight nautical miles.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.527
This boat goes 55 knots. Even
if we had full power right now,

26:15.570 --> 26:18.130
it's gonna be at least
15 minutes before we get clear.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.834
Hey, S-Sonny? I need--

26:21.880 --> 26:23.871
I need you just to stay calm
with me, okay?

26:23.930 --> 26:25.488
Hear me out here
for a minute, brother.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.838
All right. I need you
to tell me how much time

26:27.890 --> 26:29.926
you think you have
until that tube fills up.

26:33.670 --> 26:38.448
I reckon I'm gonna go
Scuba Steve about five.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.934
He's only got 15 minutes
of owgen left.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.629
He's not gonna make it.
I got to open this up.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.159
Brother, that's not gonna work.Help me get him out!

26:45.210 --> 26:46.598
That ain't gonna work.I know, I heard you.

26:46.640 --> 26:47.857
He-Help me open it up.Hey! Jason!

26:47.910 --> 26:49.070
Help me get him out.It won't budge.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.644
I don't care.It's not gonna budge! Stop!

26:50.690 --> 26:51.509
Jace.

26:55.350 --> 26:57.386
Jace, we got, we got
our weapons, man.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.431
Right? We got
our weapons.

27:00.610 --> 27:02.043
Yeah. You know what?

27:02.090 --> 27:04.172
We got our weapons.
Here's what we're gonna do.

27:04.230 --> 27:05.436
We're gonna get
the grinder,

27:05.490 --> 27:08.186
barricade that door,
we're gonna cut him out.

27:08.230 --> 27:09.401
That's what we're gonna do.

27:09.450 --> 27:10.883
Better to ask forgiveness
than permission.

27:10.930 --> 27:14.184
Master Chief, what you're
proposing is mutiny.

27:14.240 --> 27:18.017
A crime punishable by death,
even for special operators.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.368
Now, I know you're willing
to sacrifice your own lives,

27:20.420 --> 27:22.411
but you turn that grinder on,
and you'll be endangering

27:22.460 --> 27:24.416
the lives of every
man on this boat.

27:24.460 --> 27:29.329
Enemy sub is getting closer.
We maintain silent running.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.985
Master Chief, there has got
to be something we can do.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.076
You can pray that
that North Korean sub

27:34.130 --> 27:36.291
doesn't detect us.
That's about all we can do.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.253
What's going on
out there, folks?

27:44.960 --> 27:46.689
We're going quiet, Sonny.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.706
Need you to stay quiet
in there, all right, man?

27:48.750 --> 27:50.741
Hold fast, brother.SONNY : Roger that.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.831
Roger that.

27:55.580 --> 27:59.539
Master One Romeo's c_ourse
hasn't changed, SIr.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.399
He's bearing down on us.Rig for ultraquiet.

28:01.460 --> 28:03.542
Rig for ultraquiet. Aye.

28:03.590 --> 28:05.194
Rig ship for ultraquiet.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.402
Washingtoncomms are down.

29:25.450 --> 29:28.271
HARRINGTON: The enemy sub must
be right on top of 'em.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.582
They won't find the Washington. But Sonny's still stuck

29:30.630 --> 29:31.767
until the Korean sub's
cleared them.

29:31.810 --> 29:33.937
They'll get him out.
I know they will.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.166
The enemy sub seems
like it's moving away,

29:44.210 --> 29:46.075
but we're still rigged
for ultraquiet.

29:46.130 --> 29:48.121
Still no cutting?

29:48.910 --> 29:50.696
I'm gonna go find Jason.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.391
This way, right?
Show me.

30:10.020 --> 30:11.931
You still there, Sonny?

30:11.980 --> 30:15.973
SONNY:
Yeah. I ain't pickled yet,

30:16.030 --> 30:18.282
but...

30:18.330 --> 30:21.595
but it's getting close.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.892
If this is the end of game
for me...

30:26.430 --> 30:29.160
I wouldn't change
a damn thing, Clay.

30:29.210 --> 30:32.828
Joining the Teams
was the best decision...

30:32.870 --> 30:36.385
was the best decision
I ever made.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.398
Best... best decision
you ever made, too.

30:41.970 --> 30:44.700
Hasn't really felt that way
recently, man.

30:47.450 --> 30:50.408
I wouldn't trade one second...

30:50.450 --> 30:52.759
one second of being
on the Teams.

30:52.800 --> 30:57.669
This is the life I chose.
It's the life you chose.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.711
It's who we are.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.542
And don't you ever
doubt that, Clay.

31:17.610 --> 31:19.475
Tube's almost filled up.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.747
Ray, man.

31:24.790 --> 31:27.179
It's not making sense to me.

31:27.230 --> 31:30.267
None of this is. I...

31:30.320 --> 31:33.448
You know, I lost men in combat,
I lost brothers.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.798
It's just...

31:35.850 --> 31:38.626
Can't wrap my head around this.
Not making sense.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.763
It's the perfect storm
of awful luck, brother.

31:44.770 --> 31:48.331
Sonny doesn't deserve this.

31:48.380 --> 31:50.985
No, he doesn't.

31:51.030 --> 31:53.942
And right now he needs us.

31:53.990 --> 31:56.686
Come on. Let's go.

32:14.710 --> 32:16.928
Tube's almost full.

32:25.550 --> 32:28.064
How the hell are we supposed
to say goodbye?

32:42.300 --> 32:44.302
Hey, Sonny.

32:49.180 --> 32:51.171
Hey, Jason.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.056
Look, Sonny, I...

32:55.100 --> 32:59.184
Sonny, I'm real sorry I got you
in this mess, man, Ijust...

33:03.190 --> 33:07.103
You're carrying a heaw load
already, Jason.

33:07.150 --> 33:10.540
Don't saddle yourself
with the guilt from this.

33:18.430 --> 33:21.684
My number was up,
plain and simple.

33:24.260 --> 33:26.251
It's just, uh...

33:28.130 --> 33:30.655
Listen to me, Jason.

33:32.400 --> 33:37.303
I would've been dead years ago
if it were not for you.

33:37.360 --> 33:40.352
Operating alongside you...

33:44.760 --> 33:46.751
...is the greatest honor
of my life.

33:53.330 --> 33:54.979
I'm gonna see you soon,
Sonny, all right?

33:55.030 --> 33:57.021
I'm gonna see you real soon.

34:06.430 --> 34:08.648
Hey, there, Sonny boy.

34:11.170 --> 34:13.309
Ray.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.436
Do me a favor and give, uh,

34:17.490 --> 34:20.391
give them beau-beautiful kids...

34:20.440 --> 34:22.613
give 'em a big hug from me,
tell...

34:24.450 --> 34:26.179
_ ...tell 'em
theIr Uncle Sonny loves 'em.

34:28.410 --> 34:30.878
You're gonna do it
yourself, brother.

34:32.410 --> 34:36.847
You and, uh, Naima, you always

34:36.900 --> 34:42.156
treated me like family,
and,uh".

34:42.210 --> 34:45.429
you have no idea

34:45.470 --> 34:49.725
that... that meant
the world to me.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.256
Damn it, Sonny.

34:56.310 --> 34:58.653
You are family, brother.

34:58.700 --> 35:02.431
And, um... I love you.

35:12.450 --> 35:16.147
Hey, I, uh, you know,
I've been thinking,

35:16.200 --> 35:18.282
m-maybe you were right.

35:18.330 --> 35:20.321
You were right
about my leg pouch

35:20.370 --> 35:24.283
back in J-Bad last year.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.809
Look at that.

35:25.860 --> 35:30.376
It's about t-time
that the Blond Jess...

35:30.430 --> 35:32.421
realizes he's not perfect.

35:47.790 --> 35:50.258
Yeah, Clay.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.362
Same here, little buddy.

35:55.410 --> 36:00.404
Uh... I need you guys
to do me a favor

36:00.460 --> 36:01.677
and,uh".

36:01.720 --> 36:05.451
t-tell...

36:05.510 --> 36:07.455
tell Lisa I'm sorry.

36:07.510 --> 36:09.466
Just, just tell her I'm sorry.

36:12.470 --> 36:15.382
That's it from me, boys.

36:16.470 --> 36:18.426
I love you.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.698
I love you, brothers.

36:23.790 --> 36:26.566
It's time to shine.

36:27.660 --> 36:29.651
Hoo-yah.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.402
He's got five minutes.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.416
You know?

36:45.460 --> 36:47.928
He's got five minutes.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.980
RAY: One minute down.There's got to be something

36:57.040 --> 36:58.462
we're not thinking about here,
something we're missing.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.385
Jason, I am all out of answers.

37:00.430 --> 37:01.988
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.519
No, no, no, no.
Prioritize and execute.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.176
Prioritize and execute.

37:06.220 --> 37:08.120
Jace, there's nothing
to prioritize

37:08.180 --> 37:10.000
'cause there's nothing
inside here we can execute on.

37:10.050 --> 37:12.359
There's nothing we
have control over.

37:12.400 --> 37:16.780
Not the Washington,not the
enemy sub, not the tube.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.705
We can't affect a damn thing.

37:18.750 --> 37:21.218
You're right.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.659
There's nothing
we can affect in here,

37:24.720 --> 37:27.359
but there's something
we can affect outside the boat.

37:27.410 --> 37:28.934
Follow me.Jace, where are you going?

37:28.980 --> 37:31.767
Control room.

37:31.810 --> 37:33.766
Spenser, stick with Sonny.

37:33.810 --> 37:35.289
Let him know you're with him.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.205
Master Chief,
what are you doing?

37:37.250 --> 37:39.206
Sir, what happens
if the enemy sub bugs out?

37:39.250 --> 37:41.718
COB, remove these
men from control,

37:41.780 --> 37:43.259
confine them to quarters,
and notify me

37:43.300 --> 37:44.779
if they refuse to comply.

37:44.820 --> 37:46.868
Captain Edwards, this is your
command, we understand that,

37:46.910 --> 37:48.866
but Master Chief has
a plan that could work.

37:48.910 --> 37:51.470
WILKE: Sir, our propulsion
system reboot is two minutes.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.475
Once that happens, we can
evade or engage the enemy,

37:53.530 --> 37:56.693
but until then we've got
nothing to do but wait.

37:56.750 --> 38:01.187
You have a minute and a half,
Master Chief. Go.

38:01.230 --> 38:02.743
You want us to do what?ERIC: I say again,

38:02.800 --> 38:04.142
request that
the asset ship track

38:04.190 --> 38:06.317
the following coordinate
at full speed:

38:06.370 --> 38:09.271
latitude 37.559 degrees,

38:09.330 --> 38:11.753
longitude 124.508 degrees.

38:11.810 --> 38:13.539
Has to happen now.

38:13.590 --> 38:17.151
Bravo Actual, that puts our
asset into territorial waters.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.417
They're gonna pop up
on North Korean radar.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.335
That's affirmative, Havoc.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.075
He's gonna use the Ang Paggising
as a decoy,

38:22.120 --> 38:24.338
pull the enemy submarine
away from the Washington.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.597
Can that even work?

38:25.650 --> 38:27.072
HARRINGTON:
It may.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.995
North Korean radar
Is comprehenSIve.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.519
If a vessel penetrates
that perimeter,

38:30.560 --> 38:32.346
it should elicit a response.

38:32.390 --> 38:34.301
If the enemy sub is the closest
ship that's able to respond,

38:34.350 --> 38:35.863
which it more
than likely is,

38:35.920 --> 38:38.741
just might work. Question is,
can we make it happen?

38:38.790 --> 38:41.258
If we can get ahold of them
in time, we can.Tell them we're on it.

38:41.310 --> 38:44.188
Davis, send the coordinates
to that vessel ASAP.On it, sir.

38:46.230 --> 38:47.754
What the hell now?

38:47.800 --> 38:49.961
Master Chief Wilke just told us
to stand by to cut.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.408
Hey, Sonny, I know we're cutting
this thing close, man.

38:51.450 --> 38:52.621
We're gonna try and breach
this thing

38:52.670 --> 38:53.887
and get you out, okay, brother?

38:53.940 --> 38:56.283
Stand by, all right?
Just stay with me, okay?

38:56.330 --> 38:58.366
Stay with me.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.199
If that sub's gonna take the
bait, it'd better happen now.

39:43.290 --> 39:44.803
Sir, the propulsion system
is back online.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.464
EDWARDS:
Maintain ultraquiet.

39:46.510 --> 39:48.944
Sonny's got less
than a minute of air left.

40:16.190 --> 40:18.920
SONAR TECHNICIAN:
Sir, Master One's
bearing is changing.

40:18.980 --> 40:19.924
She's moving. It's working.

40:19.980 --> 40:21.368
In what direction, Chief?

40:21.410 --> 40:22.456
WILKE:
Towards the trawler, sir.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.626
Secure from ultraquiet.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.715
Helm, make your heading
three-one-seven.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.374
All-head flank.

40:26.420 --> 40:27.933
Let's get some distance
between us and them.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.060
And cut that man out of my
torpedo tube right the hell now.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.554
Cut it. You heard me. Cut it.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.113
MANDY_: _
The enemy sub Is movmg.

40:34.170 --> 40:36.070
Washington'smoving, too,
they're breaking contact.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.769
Monero, radio the trawler
right away,

40:37.820 --> 40:39.776
tell them to turn back.Copy. Stand by.

40:39.820 --> 40:42.869
Come on, Quinn, just a
little longer, buddy.

40:44.130 --> 40:46.655
Almost there!

40:46.700 --> 40:49.487
Move! Cut it open!

40:49.530 --> 40:50.781
Come on, come on.

40:52.530 --> 40:54.009
Go, let's go.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.719

41:03.890 --> 41:05.141
Turn him, come on,
turn around.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.497
Put him down.Come on, come on.

41:06.550 --> 41:08.279
Got to get his kit off.Sonny, come on.

41:08.330 --> 41:10.582
Help me get his kit off.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.629
Give me some room. Move.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.504
He's not breathing.
Give him the Ambu-bag.

41:16.210 --> 41:17.939
No pulse.
Grab the defibrillator.

41:17.990 --> 41:19.719
Come on, Sonny.
Come on, Sonny.Give me the shears.

41:19.780 --> 41:21.998
Come on, Sonny. Come on, buddy.Shears.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.380
JASON:

41:30.270 --> 41:31.214

41:34.790 --> 41:36.519
Let's go.

41:36.580 --> 41:37.524
Come on.

41:39.750 --> 41:42.218
All right.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.440
All right, everybody back off.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.183
AUTOMATED VOICE:

41:45.240 --> 41:46.923
Stand clear.

41:49.590 --> 41:51.239
No pulse. Clear.Damn it. Hit him again.

41:52.770 --> 41:53.896

41:53.940 --> 41:55.589

Turn him.

42:14.350 --> 42:17.228
Turn.
JASON:
Down. Down, down. Down.

42:17.270 --> 42:18.612
We need to get him

MM2, help me lift him.We've got him. We got him.

42:20.050 --> 42:21.836
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
