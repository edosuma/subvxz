11:14.382 --> 11:16.966
THERE.
SO WE TALKED.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.678
THAT WAS NICE.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.723
HORSES ARE BEAUTIFUL.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.141
AND THEY'RE
VERY SMART.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.978
THEY CAN COUNT,
YOU KNOW.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.438
OH, HONEY, HONEY,

11:30.606 --> 11:34.359
YOU... YOU JUST... YOU JUST
GOTTA SHUT UP.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.611
SPEAKING OF, HAS
ANYONE READ EQUUS?

11:36.779 --> 11:37.987
I GAVE A COPY
TO MIDGE,

11:38.155 --> 11:39.447
BUT... NO OFFENSE,
SWEETIE...

11:39.615 --> 11:42.575
IT MAY BE A LITTLE
TOO DEEP FOR HER.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.077
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.704
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
NO OFFENSE?

11:45.871 --> 11:47.997
WELL, I MEAN,
DON'T BE OFFENDED.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.959
OH.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.336
LISTEN, YOU INSULT
MY WIFE ONE MORE TIME,

11:53.504 --> 11:56.464
YOU'RE GONNA BE WEARING
YOUR STEAK AS A HAT.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.341
HEY, I... I'M SORRY.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.219
OH, BOB, THAT
WAS SO SWEET.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.138
LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL, WHEN YOU
USED TO HIT PEOPLE

12:03.305 --> 12:05.473
JUST FOR
LOOKING AT ME.

12:05.641 --> 12:06.808
REMEMBER?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.017
OF COURSE
I REMEMBER.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.185
I STILL HAVE THE SCAR

12:09.353 --> 12:11.354
FROM JOE ABBRUZZI'S
DENTAL PLATE.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.607
YOU BIG BEAR.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.402
RROOWWRR.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.034
I, UH, LEFT MY WALLET
IN THE CAR, MIDGE.

12:28.038 --> 12:31.207
I LEFT MY... SEX
WITH BOB IN THE CAR.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.713
CHECK, PLEASE!

12:38.340 --> 12:39.632
AH.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.968
THERE YOU GO,
THAT'S FOR YOU.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.346
COME ON, KITTY.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.183
DONNA WOULDN'T
EVEN TALK TO ME.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.269
SHE JUST KEPT STICKING HER
TONGUE DOWN MY THROAT.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.147
OH, BOO-HOO, FORMAN.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.940
YOU GET TO FOOL AROUND
WITH A TOTALLY HOT CHICK

12:56.108 --> 12:58.818
AND YOU NEVER HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT HER FEELINGS?

12:58.986 --> 13:02.739
YOU POOR, FRENCH-KISSING
BASTARD.

13:02.907 --> 13:03.782
YEAH, HYDE'S RIGHT.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.784
ONE TIME I ASKED
JACKIE WHAT WAS WRONG,

13:05.951 --> 13:10.330
AND SHE DIDN'T SHUT UP FOR,
LIKE, 3 STRAIGHT DAYS.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.081
YOU KNOW, KELSO,

13:12.249 --> 13:13.416
SOMETIMES YOU DO NOT
KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE

13:13.584 --> 13:15.001
UNTIL IT IS GONE.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.252
AND THEN
SOMEONE ELSE HAS IT

13:16.420 --> 13:17.629
AND IT IS NOT YOU.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.424
AND THEN THAT SOMEONE
ELSE IS REALLY HAPPY.

13:21.592 --> 13:22.884
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:23.052 --> 13:24.260
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT?

13:24.428 --> 13:26.596
THAT'S IT.
GET THE HELMET.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.265
KELSO,
PUT THIS ON.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.643
SHUT UP. I'M NOT PUTTING
THE HELMET ON.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.394
NOW WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:33.562 --> 13:34.854
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
I AM TALKING ABOUT

13:35.022 --> 13:38.483
IF YOU PUT
THE HELMET ON.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.903
FINE.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.575
IF YOU DON'T
TAKE CARE OF JACKIE,

13:47.743 --> 13:49.786
YOU ARE GOING
TO LOSE HER.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.081
THAT'S JUST
STUPID.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.457
LOOK, HYDE,
ALL I KNOW

13:54.625 --> 13:56.125
IS THAT YOU'RE TALKING
TO MY GIRLFRIEND,

13:56.293 --> 13:57.961
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.754
HEY, MAN, I WAS
FRIENDS WITH DONNA

13:59.922 --> 14:01.589
BEFORE YOU EVER BECAME
HER LITTLE BOYFRIEND.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.508
HYDE, YOU'RE
PISSING ME OFF.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.468
WHY DON'T YOU THINK,
FORMAN?

14:05.636 --> 14:06.845
YOU GET TO MAKE OUT

14:07.012 --> 14:08.429
WITH ONE OF THE HOTTEST
CHICKS IN WISCONSIN,

14:08.597 --> 14:09.889
WHILE I'M BEING
ALL SYMPATHETIC

14:10.057 --> 14:11.432
AND RELATING MY
CRAPPY LIFE TO HER,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.434
AND I'M
PISSING YOU OFF?

14:13.602 --> 14:14.978
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE THE FRIEND

14:15.145 --> 14:18.439
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO
BE THE MAKE OUT GUY.

14:18.607 --> 14:19.858
NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT,

14:20.025 --> 14:22.610
YOU'RE
PISSING ME OFF!

14:27.324 --> 14:29.993
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF A
WORLD ARE WE LIVING IN?

14:30.160 --> 14:31.661
HEY, LET'S DATE
OTHER PEOPLE!

14:31.829 --> 14:33.288
HEY, LET'S DATE
OTHER PEOPLE

14:33.455 --> 14:36.165
BUT DITCH 'EM
AND DO IT IN A CAR!"

14:36.333 --> 14:37.792
THAT'S ENLIGHTENED?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.211
IN MY DAY, WE CALLED
THEM DEGENERATES,

14:40.379 --> 14:42.589
AND WE STONED THEM.

14:42.756 --> 14:46.509
WITH BIG ROCKS.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.344
OH, YOU DID NOT.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.764
WELL, WE
SHOULD HAVE.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.725
WELL, YOU KNOW...

14:53.893 --> 14:57.896
YOUR BIRTHDAY'S NOT OVER
FOR ANOTHER 2 HOURS.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.357
OH, KITTY.

15:01.525 --> 15:04.861
WE HAVE NO CEILING
ON OUR BEDROOM.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.822
WHAT IF A PLANE
FLEW OVER?

15:09.450 --> 15:12.160
OKAY. WELL, THE
KIDS ARE OUT.

15:12.328 --> 15:16.414
THERE'S A BIG COMFY COUCH
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.589
YOU KNOW WHAT
I LOVE ABOUT YOU?

15:25.174 --> 15:26.591
WHAT?

15:26.759 --> 15:29.344
LOTS OF STUFF.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.180
COME ON.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.350
I'LL RACE YOU.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.646
HEY, RED,
MRS. FORMAN.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.022
HOW WAS
YOUR NIGHT?

15:41.190 --> 15:43.107
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING IN MY LIVING ROOM?

15:43.275 --> 15:44.943
WATCHING
STAR TREK.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.111
IN COLOR.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.198
SEE, THAT GUY IS ONE SIDE
BLACK AND ONE SIDE WHITE.

15:50.366 --> 15:54.577
AND THE OTHER GUY IS ONE SIDE
WHITE AND ONE SIDE BLACK.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.705
IN COLOR!

15:57.873 --> 16:02.418
THIS HOUSE IS ALWAYS
LITTERED WITH KIDS.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.463
IT'S LIKE
WE'RE MORMONS.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.467
OKAY, COME ON,
FOLLOW ME, SAILOR.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.719
RED NEEDS TO
CONTROL HIS ANGER.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.348
I HEARD THAT!

16:18.686 --> 16:20.019
OH, I KNOW!

16:20.187 --> 16:21.396
LET'S GO TO
THE BASEMENT.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.231
OH, KITTY.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.609
I JUST WANT THIS
DAY TO BE OVER.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.903
NO.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.447
THIS DAY
IS NOT OVER.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.950
I WANTED YOU TO HAVE
A NICE BIRTHDAY.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.160
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES BIRTHDAYS
ARE NOT JUST ABOUT YOU.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.079
THEY ARE ABOUT
THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU

16:38.247 --> 16:40.456
WHO WANT YOU TO HAVE
A NICE BIRTHDAY.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.667
SO, IT'S ABOUT ME.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.252
NOW GET DOWNSTAIRS

16:44.420 --> 16:47.755
AND GET THOSE
PANTS OFF, MISTER!

16:52.553 --> 16:54.887
DONNA.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.264
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.640
I... I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS A LOT,

16:57.808 --> 16:59.642
AND, UH...

16:59.810 --> 17:05.106
I'M NOT MAD ANYMORE.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.858
OKAY. MAD ABOUT WHAT?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.444
OH, WELL, UH, HYDE TOLD

17:09.611 --> 17:10.903

17:12.531 --> 17:13.948
YEAH...

17:14.116 --> 17:16.451
WELL, SEE, BUT KELSO

17:16.618 --> 17:19.078
SO HE ONLY HEARD,
LIKE, HALF OF IT.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.706
AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT
FEZ'S GRASP OF ENGLISH.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.208
I MEAN, HE NODS
A LOT, BUT...

17:24.376 --> 17:27.336
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
GUYS TALKED ABOUT ME.

17:27.504 --> 17:30.673
WELL, TO BE HONEST,

17:30.841 --> 17:33.009
IT WAS A LOT OF HYDE

AND THE SEPARATE BEDROOMS.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.431
AND I'M ALL LIKE, WHOA,
HOLD UP THERE, HYDE.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.308
I DON'T THINK SHE'D LIKE
YOU TALKING ABOUT...

17:40.476 --> 17:41.768
GOD!

17:41.935 --> 17:44.103
NO, I...
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

17:44.271 --> 17:47.857
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU TALKED TO HYDE,

17:48.025 --> 17:50.777
BUT...

17:50.944 --> 17:56.157
I FORGIVE YOU.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.284
YOU FORGIVE ME?

17:58.452 --> 17:59.702
NO, WHAT I'M SAYING...

17:59.870 --> 18:01.037
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

18:01.205 --> 18:04.415
BECAUSE
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.167
OKAY, THANKS
LOADS, ERIC,

18:06.335 --> 18:08.711
BUT YOU CAN'T
HELP ME WITH THIS.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.297
YOUR FAMILY IS...
A FAMILY.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.257
DONNA, TO BE FAIR, YOU DIDN'T
EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.635
YOU NEVER CAME TO ME
WITH THIS.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.969
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:17.137 --> 18:18.387
YOU WANT TO BE PART
OF THIS WHOLE THING?

18:18.555 --> 18:19.639
YOU DO? FINE.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.975
MY PARENTS, THEY'RE ON A
FREAKIN' DATE RIGHT NOW.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.646
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NICE.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.564
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.024
YOU KNOW,
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.026
IT TAKES SOME
OF THE PRESSURE OFF.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.112
THEY'RE EACH DATING
THE OTHER PEOPLE.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.863
BUT THEY'RE
MARRIED.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.908
OH, GOD!

18:39.076 --> 18:41.035

I MEAN...

18:41.203 --> 18:42.787
I DON'T KNOW.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.249

18:48.377 --> 18:51.629
OH, MY GOD.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.422

19:01.849 --> 19:03.015
OH, NO.

A GOOD THING?

19:12.276 --> 19:15.570

19:25.164 --> 19:28.791
WHAT AM I

20:01.283 --> 20:03.242

20:08.832 --> 20:10.583

20:10.751 --> 20:12.919
KELSO, IF YOU WANT
TO POSSESS A WOMAN,

20:13.086 --> 20:16.088
THIS IS WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO.

20:17.049 --> 20:22.595
I, AS A MORTAL, AM NOT
WORTHY OF YOUR LOVE.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.848
YOU ARE A GODDESS

I DON'T KNOW ANY MORMONS
THAT DO THAT.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.552
NOT WITHOUT A PERMIT,

21:05.931 --> 21:09.433
YOU KNOW, KITTY,

THIS ENDED UP BEING A
PRETTY GOOD BIRTHDAY

21:36.461 --> 21:39.297
SOMETHING'S NOT

I'M GETTING A
REALLY WEIRD VIBE,

21:40.841 --> 21:43.759
LIKE BEFORE

21:57.858 --> 22:03.070
MADE THE COUCH
NICE AND WARM.

22:03.238 --> 22:06.073
SOMEONE'S BEEN
EATING MY CHIPS.
