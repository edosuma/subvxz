01:24.072 --> 01:26.306
<i>I want to die with dignity.</i>

01:28.438 --> 01:31.837
<i>But when an execution's
carried out in my world,</i>

01:31.839 --> 01:33.240
<i>there's no military parade,</i>

01:34.171 --> 01:37.105
<i>no music, no march past.</i>

01:38.439 --> 01:40.937
<i>It's just a hideous death.</i>

01:40.939 --> 01:43.506
<i>No guilt. And no remorse.</i>

01:49.604 --> 01:51.005
<i>That's the way
it's always been.</i>

01:52.939 --> 01:55.939
<i>But now that I've got death
staring me in the face,</i>

01:57.338 --> 01:58.772
<i>why should I accept it?</i>

02:16.872 --> 02:18.404
<i>I knew that whoever killed
Tony and the lads</i>

02:18.406 --> 02:19.906
<i>could still be out there.</i>

02:22.272 --> 02:24.036
<i>And with every day
that went by,</i>

02:24.038 --> 02:26.405
<i>the anger and the frustration
got worse...</i>

02:27.939 --> 02:30.839
<i>until I felt the paranoia
slowly suffocating me.</i>

02:34.838 --> 02:38.003
<i>Essex had changed,
become darker.</i>

02:38.005 --> 02:40.306
<i>The pill-popping,
acid house days were long gone.</i>

02:42.004 --> 02:43.440
<i>Coke had taken over.</i>

02:45.138 --> 02:47.436
<i>Some nights,
I could smell the crack</i>

02:47.438 --> 02:49.072
<i>seeping out the pores
of their skin.</i>

03:30.205 --> 03:31.338
Where's the fucking gear?

03:31.340 --> 03:33.336
He said he sorted you out
a couple of packets already.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.970
Yeah. That's right.
I've taxed your fellow,

03:34.972 --> 03:36.304
now I'm taxing you.
Where's the fucking gear?

03:36.306 --> 03:37.969
It's gone, Carl.
I've sold my last one...

03:37.971 --> 03:40.204
- Really? Really? Really? What's this?!
- Yes.

03:40.206 --> 03:42.837
It ain't in my fucking fanny
either. Fuck's sake, Carlton.

03:42.839 --> 03:43.939
Lift it up.

03:45.471 --> 03:46.838
And that.

03:52.004 --> 03:53.336
And what's this, eh?

03:53.338 --> 03:54.538
What's this?

04:18.105 --> 04:20.569
Fucking prick, Carlton.
You're a fucking cunt!

04:20.571 --> 04:22.306
Do you hear me?
You're a fucking cunt!

04:59.271 --> 05:01.272
Come on then.
Stab me, you cunt.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.469
What's this? What's this?

05:07.471 --> 05:10.304
You dirty fucking cunt.

05:10.306 --> 05:12.536
You dirty fucking cunt.

05:12.538 --> 05:15.203
Get off...
Get off of me! Fuck off!

05:15.205 --> 05:16.305
Fuck off!

05:17.338 --> 05:19.503
What? Come again?

05:19.505 --> 05:21.837
- Calm down! Calm down!
- Fuck off!

05:21.839 --> 05:23.602
- Fuck off.
- Calm down.

05:23.604 --> 05:25.102
on the head, mate.

05:25.104 --> 05:26.402
All right. Calm down.

05:26.404 --> 05:28.772
Just calm down. All right.
Go home. Yeah?

05:30.405 --> 05:32.937
We'll talk about it later, yeah?
Just go home.

05:32.939 --> 05:34.073
Carl, calm down, yeah?

05:36.205 --> 05:38.304
We're gonna have the police
all over here. Just go home.

05:38.306 --> 05:40.236
All right?

05:40.238 --> 05:41.404
Fuckin' wankers.

05:46.005 --> 05:47.269
Cunts!

06:12.971 --> 06:14.170
Did you get my message?

06:14.172 --> 06:16.036
Well, I'm here, ain't I?

06:16.038 --> 06:17.402
Why didn't you just answer
the phone?

06:17.404 --> 06:19.172
I had someone around.
I didn't hear it ring.

06:23.105 --> 06:25.303
You know you got fucking claret
all down your face, don't you?

06:25.305 --> 06:26.806
Huh?

06:29.205 --> 06:30.439
Turn that off.

06:32.338 --> 06:33.938
There's a thing
in the glove box.

06:38.438 --> 06:40.036
Got enough fucking paper clips
in here?

06:40.038 --> 06:41.936
Yeah, well, I told you,
I had someone 'round.

06:41.938 --> 06:43.272
There's some tissues
in there or something.

06:49.437 --> 06:51.502
- Don't know why you bother?
- 'Cause I have to.

06:51.504 --> 06:52.602
Well, I know you're polo, mate,

06:52.604 --> 06:54.403
but you're gonna catch AIDS
if you ain't careful.

06:54.405 --> 06:55.839
You don't know
where those cunts have been.

07:00.404 --> 07:01.603
Is she up?

07:01.605 --> 07:03.005
No, I don't think so.

07:04.371 --> 07:05.873
Look at them fucking
noncy bollockses.

07:07.172 --> 07:10.336
Sure that cunt's Old Bill.
Fucking wanker.

07:10.338 --> 07:12.837
Just like the rest of the
fucking wankers around there.

07:12.839 --> 07:14.170
All fucking turncoats,
the lot of them.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.570
How many bags you had tonight?

07:15.572 --> 07:16.936
You starting to sound like her.

07:16.938 --> 07:19.837
Why? You want a bit?

07:19.839 --> 07:22.469
No, I'm up early. I've gotta
flop on that cunt George.

07:22.471 --> 07:25.102
Now I know where he works,
gotta pick up the dough.

07:25.104 --> 07:26.535
Better fucking have it as well.

07:26.537 --> 07:30.070
He's got it. Been driving around
in a fucking Saab 900.

07:30.072 --> 07:31.873
And if he fucks you bad,
just take it off him.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.237
Here, do you wanna lose that?

07:36.239 --> 07:37.937
Oh, fucking... You ain't...

07:37.939 --> 07:40.502
No, I ain't. Listen.
I'm gonna go in, all right,

07:40.504 --> 07:42.870
before she starts hanging out
the fucking window.

07:42.872 --> 07:43.972
I'll see you in the morning.

08:10.505 --> 08:13.336
What's this? What you doing?

08:13.338 --> 08:14.837
I'm putting the washer on.

08:14.839 --> 08:16.468
You're taking the piss.

08:16.470 --> 08:17.805
Just go to fucking bed.

08:20.504 --> 08:21.970
What's that?

08:21.972 --> 08:23.003
What?

08:23.005 --> 08:25.435
You deaf and blind,
you fat fuck? What's that?

08:25.437 --> 08:27.136
It's all over your hands?

08:27.138 --> 08:29.503
Look, all right, I'll sort it.
Just fuck off to bed.

08:29.505 --> 08:31.469
Nosey cunt.
Fuck off.

08:31.471 --> 08:33.102
I'm sick of this shit.

08:33.104 --> 08:35.335
I'm bored of your bollocks.

08:35.337 --> 08:38.005
For fuck's sake, Carlton.
You're disgusting.

09:10.438 --> 09:12.205
<i>...brutal gangland slaying...</i>

09:19.437 --> 09:22.402
<i>Discovered in a Range Rover on
a farm in Rettendon in Essex...</i>

09:27.471 --> 09:30.135
<i>...when it's expected that the names
of those murdered will be released.</i>

09:30.137 --> 09:33.335
<i>The victims were
38-year-old Anthony Tucker,</i>

09:33.337 --> 09:37.402
<i>37-year-old Patrick Tate,
and 26-year-old Craig Rolfe.</i>

09:37.404 --> 09:39.135
<i>It's believed that
all three men</i>

09:39.137 --> 09:40.371
<i>had gangland connections.</i>

10:36.238 --> 10:38.202
Mom! Dad!

10:38.204 --> 10:40.236
Dad, there's
someone out there, please!

10:40.238 --> 10:41.939
Please come and help us!

10:44.104 --> 10:45.072
Please.

10:46.470 --> 10:48.970
You're fucking sick!

10:48.972 --> 10:50.336
I'm not putting up
with this shit anymore.

10:50.338 --> 10:52.235
You're fucking sick.

10:52.237 --> 10:54.302
Come on, girls.
I'm taking the girls.

10:54.304 --> 10:56.303
We're going to my mum's
and if you come fucking near me,

10:56.305 --> 10:57.905
I'm gonna call the Old Bill.
Do you hear me?

10:59.839 --> 11:01.303
Denny, no!

11:01.305 --> 11:03.172
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Go. Go. Go.

12:04.003 --> 12:05.772
All right, mate,
fucking hell.

12:13.638 --> 12:16.502
So he comes in all guns blazing.
Drags her out of bed.

12:16.504 --> 12:18.101
Did you see the state
of her face?

12:18.103 --> 12:19.403
- No. No.
- Great big black eye.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.968
I mean, she was trying
to cover it with makeup,

12:20.970 --> 12:22.135
but it looks horrendous.

12:22.137 --> 12:23.836
She might as well
have just left it.

12:23.838 --> 12:25.203
And after that,
I'll fucking shit on her head.

12:25.205 --> 12:27.336
All right, girls.

12:27.338 --> 12:29.335
Bloody hell, he's getting big,
isn't he, Ton?

12:29.337 --> 12:30.138
I'll shit in your mouth.

12:32.305 --> 12:34.402
- Been here long?
- No, just got here.

12:34.404 --> 12:35.536
Oh, fuck off.

12:35.538 --> 12:37.303
It's all right, Dad,
you can sit down.

12:37.305 --> 12:38.436
You all right, Shawn.

12:38.438 --> 12:39.371
Well, you better buy her
a new one.

12:40.437 --> 12:41.569
- All right.
- You ordered?

12:41.571 --> 12:42.772
No, not yet.

12:43.505 --> 12:45.468
You heard from Mum?

12:45.470 --> 12:46.969
Yeah, she phoned me
this morning.

12:46.971 --> 12:48.869
And what did she have to say?

12:48.871 --> 12:50.136
She said you're a fucking mug.

12:50.138 --> 12:51.238
Oh, really?
That's nice, isn't it?

12:52.170 --> 12:53.304
Now, shut up. Listen.

12:55.504 --> 12:56.805
Look, you know how this works.

12:57.405 --> 12:59.136
Oh, fuck off.

12:59.138 --> 13:00.005
Have whatever you want.

13:01.271 --> 13:02.603
Does your little one
want something?

13:02.605 --> 13:04.402
Here, you do children's meals,
don't you, fellow?

13:04.404 --> 13:05.903
He's already had
some, thanks.

13:05.905 --> 13:07.235
Otherwise, he'll be
shitting everywhere.

13:07.237 --> 13:09.002
- Are you having something, Dad?
- No.

13:09.004 --> 13:10.535
No, I'm not hungry.

13:10.537 --> 13:13.371
Listen, I'll just have a Jack Daniels
and Coke, please, fellow. Lots of ice.

13:14.970 --> 13:16.135
You want a drink?

13:16.137 --> 13:17.469
Uh, Diet Coke.

13:17.471 --> 13:19.602
All right, so that's two
Diet Cokes please, fellow,

13:19.604 --> 13:21.969
and he'll have a cup of tea.

13:21.971 --> 13:24.303
He's owes us! Fuck off!

13:24.305 --> 13:25.805
- When you gonna make me a granddad?
- Oh, fuck off.

13:28.437 --> 13:30.602
- Problem?
- Benny wants to know if you're on the phone?

13:30.604 --> 13:32.469
I gotta find a nice bloke first.

13:32.471 --> 13:34.269
There's loads
of nice blokes in Essex.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.503
- What's he want?
- Saab 900 don't belong to George,

13:36.505 --> 13:37.968
belongs to Benny's missus.

13:37.970 --> 13:39.468
She's screwing Benny,
wants it back today.

13:39.470 --> 13:40.369
That's not my problem.

13:40.371 --> 13:42.072
That's Benny now.

13:42.937 --> 13:43.937
Hello.

13:46.004 --> 13:46.873
Calm down.

13:48.071 --> 13:48.972
He wants to speak to you.

13:51.270 --> 13:52.468
Hello, Benny.

13:52.470 --> 13:54.101
All right, listen, don't shout.

13:54.103 --> 13:56.102
No. No. Don't...
Benny, don't shout. Listen.

13:56.104 --> 13:58.368
Listen, that fucking George
has been swerving me

13:58.370 --> 14:00.570
for the last two weeks.

14:00.572 --> 14:03.336
Look, I don't care if it's your wife's
motor or Mother fucking Theresa's.

14:03.338 --> 14:06.335
I'm owed money,
so I've taken it.

14:06.337 --> 14:08.035
Look, w...
She wants it back today,

14:08.037 --> 14:10.235
you're gonna have to front
and go and see George for it.

14:10.237 --> 14:11.338
That's not my problem.

14:12.205 --> 14:13.204
No, li...

14:14.572 --> 14:15.872
Take that. He's giving me
a fucking headache.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.836
What was we saying? Oh, yeah,
why can't you get a bloke?

14:19.838 --> 14:21.603
Because the very minute
they find out who my dad is,

14:21.605 --> 14:23.336
they suddenly lose interest.

14:23.338 --> 14:24.403
It's funny that, isn't it?

14:24.405 --> 14:26.136
No, he fucking owes us.

14:26.138 --> 14:27.536
Look, if the money
ain't there tonight, right,

14:27.538 --> 14:29.837
George is going in the boot and
the motor is going in the Thames.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.472
Look, can we just have
a few more minutes?

14:35.404 --> 14:36.937
I don't know what
the cunt's problem is.

14:39.071 --> 14:41.535
He comes to us, right,
with a bit of a fucking woe

14:41.537 --> 14:44.002
that can't be sorted out
in court, right.

14:44.004 --> 14:45.368
We've done the work.
I mean, what does he want,

14:45.370 --> 14:46.869
a fucking invoice?

14:46.871 --> 14:49.205
People at Staines
take fucking liberties.

14:51.171 --> 14:53.469
And what's George going round in
a fucking Benny White anyway,

14:53.471 --> 14:55.402
over a poxy
three grand fucking debt?

14:55.404 --> 14:57.372
I know he's giving me
the right fucking hump.

14:58.870 --> 14:59.971
Cunt.

15:09.004 --> 15:10.772
- What's the time?
- Bang on one.

15:12.170 --> 15:13.038
So how did we leave it?

15:14.305 --> 15:16.139
- Is Benny coming?
- No, he's sending his nephew.

15:17.505 --> 15:20.171
Good. I can't stand
that fucking turd.

15:27.004 --> 15:28.205
No, you're all right,
I've had some.

15:29.504 --> 15:32.002
- Dave?
- I'm all right, mate.

15:39.604 --> 15:43.169
I thought you turned, uh...
your back on us, Dave? Eh?

15:43.171 --> 15:45.202
Got a proper job.

15:45.204 --> 15:48.035
What's the matter, eh? What,
you missed the act, did you? Eh?

15:48.037 --> 15:50.902
No. Just got bills to pay.

15:50.904 --> 15:52.603
Haven't we all, fellow.
Haven't we all.

15:52.605 --> 15:54.602
So, come on then, what's happening?
You phone him or what?

15:54.604 --> 15:55.871
That's what I'm doing.
No one's answering.

15:58.571 --> 16:00.271
How much would you
give me for this motor, Dave?

16:01.837 --> 16:03.236
I can't afford it.

16:03.238 --> 16:05.438
Well, let's just say
that you could.

16:06.471 --> 16:08.938
What? Four grand?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.068
Five grand?

16:13.070 --> 16:15.536
How about six grand?
That sound about right to you?

16:15.538 --> 16:16.836
Yeah?

16:16.838 --> 16:18.969
- Aye, it sounds about right.
- Aye.

16:18.971 --> 16:21.536
So if I was to offer you
this motor right now

16:21.538 --> 16:25.168
for about three grand,
a mere three grand,

16:25.170 --> 16:27.001
you'd say I was being
really generous, wouldn't you?

16:27.003 --> 16:28.068
Aye.

16:28.070 --> 16:32.502
So why the fuck are these cunts
not fucking here?

16:32.504 --> 16:35.036
Carl, I don't know what he's playing at.
I've called him three fucking times.

16:35.038 --> 16:39.101
Bollocks! Fuck him.
I'm not fucking having this.

16:39.103 --> 16:42.269
Who the fuck do they think
they are, the fucking Nortons?

16:42.271 --> 16:43.602
I don't think
they're gonna show.

16:43.604 --> 16:46.171
- Fucking wankers.
- I don't think they're gonna show.

16:48.304 --> 16:51.203
Was I talking to you,
shit cunt, eh?

16:51.205 --> 16:54.069
Was I talking to him? Just keep
your fucking mouth shut,

16:54.071 --> 16:56.936
- you fucking wanker.
- That's it. Fuck this. I'm off.

16:56.938 --> 16:58.103
Oh, really?
Go on then. Thats good!

16:58.105 --> 17:00.435
Yeah. No. I don't wanna be spoke
to like that. Bollocks.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.269
- Go on. Off you go.
- Dave. Dave, do you wanna lift?

17:02.271 --> 17:04.368
Go on. Off you go. Off you go.
Yeah. Yeah. Go on.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.268
Yeah, that's right.

17:06.270 --> 17:08.468
And you, you fucking wankers.

17:08.470 --> 17:10.603
Cunt! Fucking...

17:13.069 --> 17:15.837
Fucking cunt. Fucking turd.

17:20.503 --> 17:21.569
<i>Carlton.</i>

17:21.570 --> 17:23.502
Steve, why aren't you answering
the fucking phone?

17:23.503 --> 17:25.304
I've been calling you
fucking six times.

17:27.438 --> 17:29.804
Listen, I wanna try and fucking
sort out who's in tonight.

17:31.437 --> 17:32.904
- <i>I've already done it.</i>
- Eh?

17:34.270 --> 17:36.203
What do you mean
you've already done it?

17:36.205 --> 17:37.772
<i>The rota,
I've done it myself, Carl.</i>

17:39.103 --> 17:41.138
<i>Management stepped in.
There's been way too much agg.</i>

17:43.003 --> 17:44.268
<i>They're giving me the door now.</i>

17:44.270 --> 17:45.901
<i>They've let you go.
I'm sorry, mate.</i>

17:45.903 --> 17:47.101
What do you mean?
What... What... What...

17:47.103 --> 17:48.238
What, you've taken over
or something?

17:49.571 --> 17:50.470
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:50.472 --> 17:52.536
Jesus Christ, hang on
a fucking minute.

17:52.538 --> 17:55.002
You wouldn't even be on the door
if it weren't for me.

17:55.004 --> 17:58.336
I fucking helped you out when you
was on your fucking knees, you cunt!

17:58.338 --> 18:00.236
<i>I'm sorry, mate.
I'm just obeying orders, yeah.</i>

18:00.238 --> 18:01.404
Open this fucking door.

18:03.238 --> 18:05.205
Fucking...

18:15.205 --> 18:17.203
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hello, Thelma.</i>

18:17.205 --> 18:18.435
<i>Is Denny there?</i>

18:18.437 --> 18:19.935
<i>Carlton.
She's gone out.</i>

18:42.537 --> 18:44.570
Hello, mate, you all right?

18:44.572 --> 18:46.368
Yeah, listen, come get me.

18:46.370 --> 18:49.435
I can't stay in here.
I'm gonna go fucking mad.

19:10.171 --> 19:12.535
That fucking George is dead.

19:12.537 --> 19:15.136
If he thinks he can
just mug us off,

19:15.138 --> 19:16.536
we've gotta set an example.

19:16.538 --> 19:18.068
- Agreed.
- Ring up Mad Jack,

19:18.070 --> 19:20.835
tell him to go 'round there, douse the
cunt in petrol, and set him alight.

19:20.837 --> 19:23.002
Yeah, sweet.
Have another scotch.

19:23.004 --> 19:25.269
I mean, what's he think I am,
some sort of cunt?

19:25.271 --> 19:27.835
I've been at it longer
than all of these lot

19:27.837 --> 19:29.402
put the fuck together.

19:29.404 --> 19:31.871
And no one, no one throws me
a fucking bone.

19:33.470 --> 19:35.871
Cunt. Where's my thing?

19:37.070 --> 19:38.236
Have you seen my thing?

19:38.238 --> 19:39.436
Oy, sweetheart, come over here.

19:39.438 --> 19:40.405
It's all right, I've got it.

19:42.205 --> 19:44.239
Listen, take my friend with you.
He's doing my fucking head in.

21:40.070 --> 21:41.204
Oh...

21:45.571 --> 21:49.602
Oh, I thought we lost you,
Carlton, but you're...

21:49.604 --> 21:52.303
you're coming back now.

21:52.305 --> 21:55.335
When you boys fall,

21:55.337 --> 22:00.535
it is to me that you come.

22:00.537 --> 22:04.069
Cocaine-induced hypothermia.

22:04.071 --> 22:10.501
A result, I'm afraid, Carlton,
of... excess.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.869
Is he gonna be all right?

22:11.871 --> 22:15.435
Diazepam, yes,
it worked, but...

22:15.437 --> 22:17.136
not always.

22:17.138 --> 22:18.404
No, not always.

22:19.870 --> 22:21.403
Oh, better now.

22:24.536 --> 22:27.168
Oh, nice.

22:45.971 --> 22:48.835
Geezer you're after has jumped
out the toilet window.

22:48.837 --> 22:51.401
You be quick,
you might catch him.

22:53.037 --> 22:54.072
Good to see you, mate.

22:55.369 --> 22:57.302
How have you been?

22:57.304 --> 22:58.969
All right.

22:58.971 --> 23:00.467
I've been waiting for you
to come and see me

23:00.469 --> 23:01.470
after what happened.

23:03.004 --> 23:04.105
It's been a long time.

23:05.603 --> 23:07.468
I've been busy.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.568
He was a good man, Tony.

23:09.570 --> 23:11.872
They all were.
But they took liberties.

23:13.138 --> 23:14.338
You did well to stay out of it.

23:15.570 --> 23:17.303
I hope
their families get justice.

23:19.204 --> 23:20.470
How is yours?

23:21.469 --> 23:22.804
Denny's moved out.

23:26.003 --> 23:27.835
Carlton.

23:27.837 --> 23:30.069
Do you know how many days
a soldier can spend in combat

23:30.071 --> 23:31.304
before he starts to crack up?

23:32.838 --> 23:34.269
Sixty.

23:34.271 --> 23:35.935
If they don't pull them out
after that,

23:35.937 --> 23:37.804
98 percent of them are ready
for the loony bin.

23:40.837 --> 23:42.104
What's happened to you, Carlton?

23:44.038 --> 23:46.269
- I'm all right.
- You're shaking, fellow.

23:46.271 --> 23:49.035
You been living on the
front line for too long, son,

23:49.037 --> 23:50.904
and in our world,
no one pulls you out.

23:57.171 --> 23:59.002
Can you throw me some work?

23:59.004 --> 24:00.304
You'll have to straighten
yourself out.

24:01.870 --> 24:03.136
People are
swerving you, Carl,

24:03.138 --> 24:04.538
because you've become
unpredictable.

24:06.003 --> 24:09.938
They're saying...
you're a liability, son.

24:12.138 --> 24:14.172
Here you are. Two bags there.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.202
Take it.

24:17.204 --> 24:19.835
Spend it on coke if you like.

24:19.837 --> 24:21.771
Or sort yourself out
and get back in the gym.

24:23.404 --> 24:26.202
You stepped off
the merry-go-round, son.

24:26.204 --> 24:27.172
Time you got back on it.

24:33.537 --> 24:35.169
<i>When
the underworld throws you</i>

24:35.171 --> 24:36.205
<i>a lifeline,</i>

24:37.437 --> 24:38.871
<i>you take it.</i>

24:40.571 --> 24:42.105
<i>I wasn't prepared to die.</i>

24:44.003 --> 24:46.038
<i>And I wasn't about
to throw the towel in either.</i>

27:13.504 --> 27:16.568
Fucking hell,
don't know about Pikies,

27:16.570 --> 27:18.501
it's like the ICF
popped in for a pint.

27:18.503 --> 27:20.134
It's all right, fellow,
you can put that down.

27:20.136 --> 27:22.135
Reg sent us.

27:22.137 --> 27:23.868
Mate, tell these cunts
to stop banging.

27:23.870 --> 27:24.871
Where's Geoff King?
We wanna talk to him.

27:26.470 --> 27:30.101
He's in the office.
Bit shaken up.

27:30.103 --> 27:32.135
So is this the first time
this has happened or what?

27:32.137 --> 27:35.100
Yeah. He's not had
the place long.

27:35.102 --> 27:38.004
He's a nice fellow,
but he hasn't got a clue.

27:39.237 --> 27:40.502
You don't say.

27:40.504 --> 27:42.968
That's why
he brought me in, you know.

27:42.970 --> 27:44.772
Someone who knows
the game and that.

27:49.403 --> 27:50.771
Follow me, gents.

27:52.137 --> 27:53.836
Cunt.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.902
Want a drink?

27:54.904 --> 27:56.067
Yeah, go on.

27:56.069 --> 27:58.435
Hey, darling, can I get
a couple of Diet Cokes please?

27:58.437 --> 28:00.005
Don't worry about the ice.

28:05.003 --> 28:07.235
They just kept kicking me.

28:07.237 --> 28:08.438
They're like bloody animals.

28:11.070 --> 28:12.905
They told this prat
it was an anniversary.

28:14.369 --> 28:15.835
Who is they?

28:15.837 --> 28:16.769
Two girls came in.

28:16.771 --> 28:18.869
They said it was
their mum and dad's 50th.

28:18.871 --> 28:19.802
Did you get their names?

28:19.804 --> 28:22.367
Uh, Tina was one.
I don't know the other.

28:22.369 --> 28:23.335
What, you didn't get
their details?

28:23.337 --> 28:24.568
Did he fuck?

28:24.570 --> 28:26.334
I didn't know
that they were Pikies.

28:26.336 --> 28:28.001
It couldn't have been
more obvious if they'd tried

28:28.003 --> 28:30.601
to sell you
lucky fucking heather.

28:30.603 --> 28:32.434
They always send
the women in first.

28:32.436 --> 28:33.769
Well, they seemed
all right to me.

28:33.771 --> 28:35.936
I didn't know that two hours
later, there'd be hundreds of them.

28:35.938 --> 28:37.168
Yeah. It was a wedding.

28:37.170 --> 28:39.401
The women were all at one end,

28:39.403 --> 28:41.167
and the men were
all stood at the other.

28:41.169 --> 28:43.101
Then the kids starting letting
off the fire extinguishers.

28:43.103 --> 28:46.035
Yeah. It was a wedding.

28:46.037 --> 28:47.835
I've been to a couple.

28:47.837 --> 28:49.301
They were pulling
their own pints.

28:49.303 --> 28:52.602
I tried to speak to them.
They just went berserk.

28:52.604 --> 28:55.171
Where was your door staff
while all this was happening?

28:56.370 --> 28:57.404
Being knocked unconscious.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.502
Two of them are now in hospital.

29:00.504 --> 29:02.167
What did the Old Bill say?

29:02.169 --> 29:04.201
They said once they find
a place they like,

29:04.203 --> 29:05.368
they keep coming back.

29:05.370 --> 29:06.538
Yeah, they will.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.037
I can't go through this again.

29:12.470 --> 29:13.938
I'll see what I can do.

29:16.403 --> 29:17.403
Excuse us.

29:21.102 --> 29:22.367
<i>What you thinking?</i>

29:22.369 --> 29:23.871
<i>I think it's a lot
of vag. It's a shithole.</i>

29:25.370 --> 29:27.467
It's a big shithole though.

29:27.469 --> 29:30.204
I'd knock that through.
Turn the whole place into one big club.

29:32.136 --> 29:33.302
What do you think of him?

29:33.304 --> 29:35.034
He's a mug.

29:35.036 --> 29:36.601
He's obviously got a lot
of Dorises working for him.

29:36.603 --> 29:38.502
It's all right. Fuck them off.

29:38.504 --> 29:39.772
Bring in our own lumps.

29:42.136 --> 29:44.171
We can sort out this agg
and take over the whole lot.

29:45.370 --> 29:47.435
He owns the freehold...

29:47.437 --> 29:48.772
and we own him.

29:50.904 --> 29:53.000
I think we should swerve it.
I mean, I fucking hate clubs,

29:53.002 --> 29:55.302
and you're gonna get
right back on the sniff.

29:55.304 --> 29:58.034
I collect debts, I don't run
fucking doors, do I?

29:58.036 --> 29:59.868
Plus, it's gonna take
a load of our fucking time

29:59.870 --> 30:01.901
and... what about the work?

30:01.903 --> 30:04.235
Jesus, I'm not asking you to give
up kidnapping and torturing people.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.034
All I'm saying is
if we set this up properly,

30:06.036 --> 30:07.004
it'll take care of itself.

30:09.069 --> 30:12.235
Mate, I'm on my fucking
knees here, help me out.

30:12.237 --> 30:14.835
Just trying to get
my family back.

30:14.837 --> 30:16.370
Listen, we could sort out
the bits and pieces.

30:18.204 --> 30:20.168
We can make fucking
bundles here, I'm telling you.

30:20.170 --> 30:21.968
Fucking bundles.

30:21.970 --> 30:23.438
Nah, that's what Pat
and Tony thought.

30:29.337 --> 30:31.067
Yeah, but things are
different now, aren't they?

30:31.069 --> 30:31.936
Are they?

30:36.437 --> 30:37.867
I bet there's no food
in the house.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.968
If it is,
it's probably gone off.

30:39.970 --> 30:41.371
There's milk in the fridge.

30:42.469 --> 30:44.001
And who's doing your washing?

30:44.003 --> 30:46.338
Me. Who do you think
is bloody doing it?

30:47.869 --> 30:50.334
Bet you've taken it down
to the laundrette.

30:50.336 --> 30:52.168
Listen. I might not be
the greatest dad in the world,

30:52.170 --> 30:54.870
but I know how to wash
my own bloody shorts, girl.

30:58.869 --> 31:01.837
- Do you want me to come over?
- No! I'm all right.

31:06.070 --> 31:08.238
You seen the posters,
my new club?

31:09.436 --> 31:10.468
No, you haven't got a club.

31:10.470 --> 31:11.836
Yes, I have.

31:13.603 --> 31:15.867
Tell Denny
when you see her, all right,

31:15.869 --> 31:17.568
that I'm gonna be
kayko again soon.

31:17.570 --> 31:20.368
Tell her I'm gonna be dripping
with dough, all right.

31:20.370 --> 31:21.772
Tell her that.

31:25.869 --> 31:27.370
And don't forget
it's Jody's birthday next week.

31:28.604 --> 31:30.302
When?

31:30.304 --> 31:31.703
You're bloody outrageous, Dad.

31:31.705 --> 31:34.772
I know when she was born. I just
don't know what day it is next week.

31:36.570 --> 31:38.868
- It's next Sunday.
- All right.

31:38.870 --> 31:41.104
Well... I'll get her
something nice.

32:01.403 --> 32:02.835
Listen. I know
it's opening night

32:02.837 --> 32:05.167
and everyone's a bit excited,
but one of your doormen's out there,

32:05.169 --> 32:07.235
waving about what looks like
a cattle prod.

32:07.237 --> 32:08.871
Yeah, that's Mad Jack.
I'll tell him to put it away.

32:14.204 --> 32:17.104
Hello, darling. So is your Nan
making you a birthday cake?

32:18.370 --> 32:19.771
You gonna save me some?

32:23.303 --> 32:25.302
No.

32:25.304 --> 32:27.035
Of course I have.

32:27.037 --> 32:28.601
<i>Are you gonna bring it
to Nana's house?</i>

32:28.603 --> 32:31.234
Yeah. Well, I'll have to speak
to your mum first.

32:31.236 --> 32:32.534
<i>Jaime, give me
the phone back.</i>

32:32.536 --> 32:36.900
I'll tell Mum.
Mum! Mum! Mum!

32:36.902 --> 32:38.101
<i>What did you say to her?</i>

32:38.103 --> 32:39.334
I didn't say nothing to her.

32:39.336 --> 32:41.537
<i>Thanks for that. I've gotta try
and get her to bed now.</i>

32:43.503 --> 32:45.035
So what's happening
about tomorrow?

32:45.037 --> 32:46.669
<i>I don't know, all right.</i>

32:46.671 --> 32:48.834
<i>I've got two kids screaming the
house down and I'm at my Mum's.</i>

32:48.836 --> 32:50.402
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

32:59.303 --> 33:00.867
<i>Fucking cunt!</i>

33:00.869 --> 33:03.168
- Hello, mate, you all right?
- <i>Mate, you better get down here,</i>

33:03.170 --> 33:04.602
<i>the fucking gypos have
turned up. We're outnumbered.</i>

33:05.836 --> 33:08.337
Go. Go. Go. Go.
You Cunt! Move!

33:47.236 --> 33:48.271
Fucking cunt!

33:51.970 --> 33:53.238
Aah!

33:55.536 --> 33:57.135
Mad Jack, get him off me!

33:57.137 --> 34:00.000
Die, you cunt!
Die, you gypsy cunt!

34:00.002 --> 34:01.804
Die, you fucking gypsy cunt!

34:07.470 --> 34:09.467
Oy! What the fuck?

34:09.469 --> 34:12.471
Now, Tony, shake his
fucking hand, you silly cunts.

34:17.902 --> 34:20.266
- Jon Jon.
- Carlton.

34:20.268 --> 34:21.568
Long time no see.

34:21.570 --> 34:23.266
What you doing down here?

34:23.268 --> 34:25.304
I come down for a wedding.
I thought I'd stay here, mate.

34:27.268 --> 34:29.601
I wanna apologize for the action
of these young men.

34:29.603 --> 34:32.467
Okay. They can't hold
their beer.

34:32.469 --> 34:34.333
- This is my son. My youngest.
- Hello, mate.

34:34.335 --> 34:35.867
- You all right?
- Steve.

34:35.869 --> 34:37.935
How you doing? You all right?
Good to see you.

34:37.937 --> 34:39.534
Listen, guys, do you wanna
pop in for a drink?

34:39.536 --> 34:41.001
Yeah. Yeah.
Sure, that'd be good.

34:41.003 --> 34:42.569
- Yeah, nice one. Thank you very much.
- Come on.

34:48.603 --> 34:50.168
Hey, love, can you take
these gentlemen up

34:50.170 --> 34:51.833
to the VIP for me please.

34:51.835 --> 34:52.870
Cheers, darling.
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

34:54.870 --> 34:56.502
Are you mad?

34:56.504 --> 34:57.369
Listen, that geezer over there

34:57.371 --> 34:59.901
is a very good pal
of mine, all right.

34:59.903 --> 35:02.402
He also happens to be one of the best
bare-knuckle fighters in the country.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.904
So fucking look after him.

35:31.970 --> 35:34.037
See. Ain't so bad after all.

35:38.969 --> 35:41.303
Fucking love you, mate.
I fucking love you.

36:36.503 --> 36:38.402
Fuck off. Fuck off.

36:38.404 --> 36:41.037
Fuck off. Fuck off.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.304
Don't worry, he doesn't bite
as hard as me.

36:45.603 --> 36:46.868
You wanna see
the state of your neck?

36:46.870 --> 36:48.001
It looks like
you've been mauled.

36:50.336 --> 36:51.503
Thanks.

36:52.936 --> 36:54.104
I would say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

36:56.370 --> 36:57.837
So what's my name?

37:00.337 --> 37:02.235
Don't know.

37:02.237 --> 37:03.537
Well, that's fucking great,
isn't it?

37:05.337 --> 37:06.837
- Lorraine?
- No.

37:09.404 --> 37:11.901
Come on, Woody. I'm gonna
bring you down for a pee.

37:11.903 --> 37:13.937
Would you like
a cup of tea, Carlton?

37:27.103 --> 37:28.267
For fuck's sake.

37:39.269 --> 37:40.901
<i>You have one new message.</i>

37:40.903 --> 37:42.235
<i>First message.</i>

37:42.237 --> 37:46.500
<i>Hello, Dad, Nana got me
a new birthday dress.</i>

37:46.502 --> 37:48.234
<i>Please come to my party.</i>

37:58.468 --> 37:59.837
Cheers, Lucy.

38:02.435 --> 38:04.237
- So what's she gonna say?
- Who?

38:05.370 --> 38:06.871
Your wife when you go home?

38:08.037 --> 38:09.134
Nothing.

38:09.136 --> 38:10.770
So how long have you
been together?

38:11.970 --> 38:13.533
What's it got to do with you?

38:13.535 --> 38:15.900
Last night, you were pilled up
asking if you could stay here

38:15.902 --> 38:17.500
while you were getting
your shit together.

38:17.502 --> 38:19.070
And what, I can't ask you
a question now?

38:21.303 --> 38:22.900
Look, if you think
you're the only villain

38:22.902 --> 38:24.967
that I've fucked in this bed,
you're even more stupid

38:24.969 --> 38:26.303
than your wife for putting up
with your shit.

38:28.503 --> 38:31.037
- Mouthy, ain't you!
- I'm not actually.

38:32.337 --> 38:34.204
Because if I was,
I'd probably be dead by now.

38:36.237 --> 38:37.804
Don't worry, I know
when to keep my mouth shut.

38:40.103 --> 38:41.771
Who's the lump
in the photo?

38:55.204 --> 38:56.537
What's that got to do with you?

39:02.070 --> 39:03.504
Nothing.

39:10.503 --> 39:12.403
- Hello, Thelma.
- What do you want?

39:14.203 --> 39:15.837
Ain't you fucking dead yet?

39:21.536 --> 39:23.834
What is it now, Carlton?

39:23.836 --> 39:25.568
I just wanna come 'round
and wish my daughter

39:25.570 --> 39:27.268
happy birthday,
if it's all right?

39:27.270 --> 39:29.302
Look at the state of you.

39:29.304 --> 39:31.302
Yeah, well, we had a bit
of agg at the club last night.

39:31.304 --> 39:32.370
I'm not interested.

39:35.402 --> 39:37.467
You coming in or what?

39:37.469 --> 39:38.567
Dad.

39:38.569 --> 39:40.267
Yeah.

39:40.269 --> 39:41.533
Happy birthday, darling.

39:41.535 --> 39:43.868
Aww!

39:43.870 --> 39:45.401
All right. All right,
don't drop him.

39:45.403 --> 39:46.467
What do you say
to your dad?

39:46.469 --> 39:47.600
Thank you.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.900
Yeah. Do I get a kiss?

39:49.902 --> 39:51.104
There you go. All right.

39:52.903 --> 39:54.037
That'll be pissing everywhere.

39:55.603 --> 39:57.004
You know my mum hates dogs.

40:00.569 --> 40:03.134
You gonna take
your coat off or what?

40:03.136 --> 40:05.968
No. No, I've gotta go.
I've got a bit of work on.

40:05.970 --> 40:06.936
Of course you have.

40:10.869 --> 40:12.336
He's my pup.

40:16.970 --> 40:20.333
Look, I want you and the kids
to come back home.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.534
I told you, Carl,
I'm not doing it.

40:22.536 --> 40:25.935
Yeah, well, that's what I wanted to talk
to you about, you know. It's just...

40:25.937 --> 40:26.570
What?

40:27.870 --> 40:29.301
Look, can't we just go inside?

40:29.303 --> 40:30.504
It's hardly a fucking secret.

40:32.403 --> 40:35.035
All right. Well, I'm moving out.

40:35.037 --> 40:36.366
I don't think it's fair
that you and the girls

40:36.368 --> 40:37.836
are cooped up 'round here,
you know.

40:39.903 --> 40:40.967
Where are you going?

40:40.969 --> 40:43.067
I'll probably stay
with a friend.

40:43.069 --> 40:43.936
Right.

40:48.836 --> 40:50.237
Right. Well, thanks
for stopping by, yeah.

40:54.602 --> 40:55.903
Take this.

40:58.237 --> 41:00.202
Thanks.

41:13.469 --> 41:17.100
Abass, you remember Carlton?

41:17.102 --> 41:18.803
He used to be a very
close friend of the family's.

41:21.236 --> 41:22.503
Before the troubles.

41:23.937 --> 41:26.367
No. You're too young.

41:26.369 --> 41:27.469
How's the rest of the family?

41:28.535 --> 41:30.101
Busy as always.

41:30.103 --> 41:31.967
That's good to hear.

41:31.969 --> 41:33.067
Are you sure
you don't want a drink?

41:33.069 --> 41:35.334
No, no, no, no.
He's a good boy.

41:35.336 --> 41:36.537
Bit like his father.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.333
So you still like to gamble?

41:45.335 --> 41:46.771
You know win some, lose some.

41:48.170 --> 41:49.934
What about lately?

41:49.936 --> 41:51.400
Lose some.

41:51.402 --> 41:53.167
How much?

41:53.169 --> 41:56.870
Two trucks.
One has been stripped. Gone.

41:58.137 --> 42:00.037
The other one's sitting
in a barn somewhere in Kent.

42:01.836 --> 42:03.266
Done by the same people.

42:03.268 --> 42:05.500
Yeah, it's been happening
a lot recently.

42:05.502 --> 42:08.134
That's a little bit naughty to hijack
a truck that's already been stolen.

42:08.136 --> 42:10.267
Well, we live in dark times,
my friend.

42:10.269 --> 42:12.366
Booze or fags?

42:12.368 --> 42:15.000
Vodka. Courtesy of France.

42:15.002 --> 42:16.935
What about the driver?

42:16.937 --> 42:18.837
He put up a fight,
but they stabbed him.

42:20.168 --> 42:21.303
We think he's dead.

42:22.570 --> 42:25.001
The other guy got away. Lucky.

42:25.003 --> 42:26.771
Because that's why we know
where the truck is.

42:28.336 --> 42:29.537
We need someone to reclaim it.

42:32.402 --> 42:33.436
What do you think?

42:37.570 --> 42:39.137
I think we should go and get it.

43:13.535 --> 43:15.401
I was humping
the missus last night

43:15.403 --> 43:18.467
and after about six minutes,

43:18.469 --> 43:21.868
I shoot my load,
roll over, spark up.

43:21.870 --> 43:24.167
She starts going
all fucking Garrity,

43:24.169 --> 43:27.266
"Ain't you gonna finish me off,
you selfish bastard?"

43:27.268 --> 43:28.134
So I smothered her.

43:30.435 --> 43:32.266
- You are joking?
- Nah.

43:32.268 --> 43:35.234
- Did you have to bring him?
- What?

43:35.236 --> 43:37.301
Oh, it's all right. She's
still alive, the fat bitch.

43:39.368 --> 43:41.068
Listen, you shut
your fucking mouth

43:41.070 --> 43:42.067
and stay away from me.

43:42.069 --> 43:44.034
Don't be giving me
no fucking orders, sweaty.

43:45.369 --> 43:47.166
You ain't in the army now.

43:47.168 --> 43:48.401
What the fuck
you doing here anyway?

43:48.403 --> 43:50.500
I'm here to drive
your fucking wagon.

43:50.502 --> 43:51.600
I forgot you two
fancy each other.

43:51.602 --> 43:53.568
Oh, Felix, just ignore him.

43:53.570 --> 43:56.333
Listen, I don't like idiots, Carlton.
Idiots get you fucking killed.

43:56.335 --> 43:59.034
Okay, action man, how about I ram
this down your fucking throat?

43:59.036 --> 44:01.134
I'll drop you
in a fucking heartbeat, cunt.

44:01.136 --> 44:03.067
Oh, come on, you two,
cut the bollocks.

44:03.069 --> 44:04.803
Calm down.

44:07.603 --> 44:08.870
Cunt.

44:15.435 --> 44:17.537
All right. Let's go.

45:21.869 --> 45:23.036
Hey!

45:48.203 --> 45:50.067
Get on the fucking floor!

45:50.069 --> 45:51.533
Get on the fucking floor now!

45:51.535 --> 45:52.870
Get down now!

45:54.936 --> 45:56.466
Fucking prick!

45:56.468 --> 45:57.870
Where's the fucking keys?

46:00.269 --> 46:01.966
Speak English, you fucking cunt?

46:01.968 --> 46:03.170
Where's the fucking keys
to the truck?

46:10.536 --> 46:12.436
Carlton! Fucking jackpot, mate.

46:13.502 --> 46:14.467
Go switch the plates over.

46:14.469 --> 46:15.966
All right, mate.

46:15.968 --> 46:17.835
Nobody fucking move!

46:17.837 --> 46:18.870
Get down, you cunts!

46:25.336 --> 46:26.537
What the fuck is that?

46:38.269 --> 46:40.102
Oh, man, is that the driver?

46:41.570 --> 46:43.467
What the fuck
we gonna do with this?

46:43.469 --> 46:45.369
We'll get him up.
He's coming with us.

46:53.368 --> 46:55.333
How's that driver getting on?

46:55.335 --> 46:58.133
He won't be working
for us again, but he'll live.

46:58.135 --> 47:00.234
Nice work, Carlton. Thank you.

47:00.236 --> 47:01.336
Might have another job
if you're interested.

47:03.202 --> 47:05.234
- I'm listening.
- You're gonna need your passports.

47:13.968 --> 47:15.300
Go on.

47:15.302 --> 47:16.934
How does Tenerife sound?

47:16.936 --> 47:18.999
- Lovely.
- Well, we have a club out there,

47:19.001 --> 47:20.466
and it makes good money.

47:20.468 --> 47:21.935
When people pay their taxes,
everyone's happy.

47:23.403 --> 47:26.966
When certain individuals
choose to ignore that...

47:26.968 --> 47:29.433
we have a problem.

47:29.435 --> 47:32.367
Well, it's simple. If people wanna
serve up, then you gotta pay.

47:32.369 --> 47:33.999
So we can take care
of that for you.

47:34.001 --> 47:35.835
Absolutely.

47:35.837 --> 47:36.869
Why not.

47:38.102 --> 47:41.170
Listen, excuse me
for a minute, gents.

47:43.336 --> 47:44.433
Do you know Tenerife?

47:44.435 --> 47:46.266
Well, to be honest,
it's not really my cup of tea,

47:46.268 --> 47:47.900
but Carlton's done
some work out there with Tony

47:47.902 --> 47:50.066
when Nigel Benn
was training for a fight.

47:50.068 --> 47:51.966
So, you know, why not.

47:51.968 --> 47:53.300
Good.

47:56.035 --> 47:57.866
Fucking hell, you on Viagra
or something?

47:57.868 --> 47:59.601
Keep your mouth shut.

47:59.603 --> 48:01.967
What if I don't?

48:01.969 --> 48:04.534
I'm gonna ram your knickers down
your fucking throat, you bitch.

48:04.536 --> 48:07.134
Oh, fuck me,
you bastard, fuck me.

48:07.136 --> 48:09.936
Oh!

48:29.136 --> 48:30.836
Oh, man, look at that.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.003
Gorgeous.

48:40.335 --> 48:42.201
Women, eh?

48:42.203 --> 48:44.534
Boob jobs. Nose jobs.

48:44.536 --> 48:46.933
Teeth bleaching. Tummy tucks.

48:46.935 --> 48:49.366
Liposuction. Colonic irrigation.

48:49.368 --> 48:51.300
Botox.

48:51.302 --> 48:55.467
Pierced ears, nipples,
belly buttons, anklets.

48:55.469 --> 48:58.600
Eyebrows plucked. Bikinis waxed.

48:58.602 --> 49:01.100
Arm pits shaved. Lips tattooed.

49:01.102 --> 49:03.237
Diets. Exercise.

49:04.868 --> 49:06.835
But they won't take it
in the fucking arse.

49:08.336 --> 49:09.601
'Cause that hurts.

49:09.603 --> 49:11.270
- You're a sick cunt.
- Yeah.

49:37.868 --> 49:40.134
Is that fucking Tom Cruise?

49:40.136 --> 49:41.600
Brixton Belly.

49:41.602 --> 49:43.234
How you doing, fella,
you all right?

49:43.236 --> 49:45.966
- Ah, how's it going?
- Good to see you.

49:45.968 --> 49:48.033
Stan. Fucking hell,
what's happened to you?

49:48.035 --> 49:49.966
You're like a fucking lizard.

49:49.968 --> 49:52.301
It's hot out here.
Pissing it down at home, is it?

49:52.303 --> 49:53.534
Yeah. You're not wrong.

49:53.536 --> 49:56.333
Shawn, this is Stan.
This is Bob.

49:56.335 --> 49:57.835
Take a seat, gents.

49:59.369 --> 50:02.501
Here, darling, can I get
a couple of Long Island Ice Teas

50:02.503 --> 50:04.866
for these two, and we'll just
get a couple of Cokes,

50:04.868 --> 50:05.533
- lots of ice.
- You not drinking?

50:05.535 --> 50:07.266
Nah, not just yet.

50:07.268 --> 50:09.134
Me and Bob go way back,
don't we, fellow, eh?

50:09.136 --> 50:10.234
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

50:10.236 --> 50:11.899
And this geezer,
we used to work the door

50:11.901 --> 50:12.999
at the Ministry
of Sound, isn't it?

50:13.001 --> 50:14.500
That's it. Yeah, them were
the days, mate, remember.

50:14.502 --> 50:17.200
Remember when fucking Big Lenny tried
to come and take the door off us.

50:17.202 --> 50:19.466
Fucking hell. I thought I was
gonna have to shoot the cunt.

50:19.468 --> 50:21.934
I was hardly gonna roll around on
the cobbles with an 80-stone monster,

50:21.936 --> 50:23.067
you know what I mean?
Fuck that.

50:23.069 --> 50:25.301
Tell you what, you're gonna love
this Demikran's place.

50:25.303 --> 50:27.500
- It's right next to the club.
- And I've got the fucking greatest

50:27.502 --> 50:29.166
on this fucking island,
Rocket Fuel.

50:29.168 --> 50:30.102
I bet you have.

50:33.001 --> 50:34.536
This gear is ridiculous.

50:36.002 --> 50:37.833
I love the smell of it.

50:37.835 --> 50:40.099
I'm telling you.
It makes the girls go mental.

50:40.101 --> 50:42.367
This wanker's big sister

50:42.369 --> 50:45.100
used to stash cocaine
in the used underwear basket,

50:45.102 --> 50:47.433
so technically,
his drug addiction is her fault.

50:50.535 --> 50:53.434
Yeah. You're probably right.

50:53.436 --> 50:55.202
<i>Hi, this
is Denny. Leave me a message.</i>

50:58.469 --> 50:59.903
They're sniffing
their heads off in there.

51:03.869 --> 51:04.936
You get hold of her?

51:06.535 --> 51:07.869
She's not answering her phone.

51:15.336 --> 51:18.233
Me and Tony had
such a laugh out here.

51:18.235 --> 51:20.866
We were side by side.

51:20.868 --> 51:23.366
We just knew we had
each other's back.

51:23.368 --> 51:24.835
We was untouchable.

51:27.203 --> 51:28.537
It should have stayed like that.

51:30.403 --> 51:32.433
Wasn't your fault, mate.

51:32.435 --> 51:34.266
I let people down, Shawn.

51:34.268 --> 51:36.233
That's what I do.

51:36.235 --> 51:37.537
I walked out on my son.

51:39.102 --> 51:40.501
And now I'm doing
exactly the same

51:40.503 --> 51:41.836
with Denny and the kids.

51:45.036 --> 51:46.334
I'm gonna lose them, Shawn.

51:46.336 --> 51:47.935
No, you'll sort it, mate.

51:49.835 --> 51:50.934
You reckon?

51:50.936 --> 51:51.902
Yeah, 'course.

51:53.403 --> 51:54.836
I can't end up like Tony.

52:01.136 --> 52:02.936
You know I'm always gonna
be there for you, don't you?

52:05.503 --> 52:06.936
Yeah, I know, mate.

52:09.536 --> 52:11.300
Come on.
Let's go and see

52:11.302 --> 52:12.835
if that mad cunt's had
a heart attack.

52:15.601 --> 52:18.133
How is things going
with Mickey Steele and Jack?

52:18.135 --> 52:19.301
They're still waiting
their trial, aren't they?

52:19.303 --> 52:21.034
Do you think they did it?

52:21.036 --> 52:22.936
Doesn't matter what I think.
It ain't gonna bring Tony back.

52:26.102 --> 52:28.067
What if they didn't do it?

52:28.069 --> 52:29.900
Then whoever did
is still walking about.

52:29.902 --> 52:31.900
That's why I ain't
coming back, bruv.

52:31.902 --> 52:33.599
The Ends is a shithole.

52:33.601 --> 52:35.267
You could get popped by anyone.

52:35.269 --> 52:37.433
If the Yardies ain't trying
to fucking burst you,

52:37.435 --> 52:39.167
the Nortons will.

52:39.169 --> 52:40.933
I'm telling you,
I'm not going back to Essex

52:40.935 --> 52:43.134
until it fucking calms down
with bass.

52:43.136 --> 52:45.933
Well, you'll be waiting
a long time then, won't you?

52:45.935 --> 52:47.467
Essex will never calm down.
There's too many people at it.

52:47.469 --> 52:49.567
Which is fine.

52:49.569 --> 52:51.370
As long as you
don't take the piss.

52:53.403 --> 52:55.370
- It's good to see you, big fellow.
- You too, man.

52:57.002 --> 52:59.270
Right. Well, we better go
and check on the door.

53:00.601 --> 53:02.934
Lads, soon as
you're ready, come down.

53:02.936 --> 53:03.936
We'll look after you.

53:11.336 --> 53:13.366
I reckon that's them.

53:13.368 --> 53:14.400
Yeah, mate, you're right.

53:14.402 --> 53:16.500
Boys. It's cunt o'clock.

53:16.502 --> 53:17.936
Let's go.

55:19.268 --> 55:20.802
Evening, gents.

55:23.969 --> 55:25.433
Who you paying rent to?

55:25.435 --> 55:27.234
Who the fuck are you?

55:27.236 --> 55:30.133
My name's Carlton Leach.
Now answer the question.

55:30.135 --> 55:32.133
We pay the club.

55:32.135 --> 55:34.465
You see the thing is,

55:34.467 --> 55:36.599
the owner of this club is
a very good friend of mine.

55:36.601 --> 55:38.536
And he begs to differ.

55:46.101 --> 55:47.499
Come with me.

55:47.501 --> 55:50.833
It's all right,
I ain't gonna hurt you.

55:50.835 --> 55:52.070
Just wanna talk business.

56:00.601 --> 56:02.935
These men belong to us.

56:05.367 --> 56:06.870
But they got greedy.

56:07.902 --> 56:10.433
From now on,
you pay Demikran direct.

56:10.435 --> 56:11.936
Do you understand?

56:36.302 --> 56:38.000
Oy-oy.

56:38.002 --> 56:40.266
- You all right?
- What you up to?

56:40.268 --> 56:43.033
Not much. Denny said
you were in Tenerife.

56:43.035 --> 56:45.499
Yeah. Me and Shawn had
a bit of work out there.

56:45.501 --> 56:47.566
Oh, well, me and the girls
are thinking about going.

56:47.568 --> 56:49.999
Let me know when you wanna go 'cause
my mate's got an apartment out there.

56:50.001 --> 56:52.100
- You could stay there for nothing.
- Oh, wicked. Thanks, Dad.

56:52.102 --> 56:53.170
It's all right.

56:54.135 --> 56:55.236
Who's that?

56:56.534 --> 56:57.769
It's my new man.

56:58.901 --> 57:00.566
Oh, behave.
He's about 12, ain't he?

57:00.568 --> 57:01.902
Shut up.

57:02.968 --> 57:04.233
What's he doing
standing over there?

57:04.235 --> 57:07.335
Well... he's Millwall,
ain't he?

57:09.069 --> 57:10.233
You're fucking joking me,
ain't you?

57:10.235 --> 57:12.133
'Course he ain't.

57:12.135 --> 57:13.567
Nick. What you standing
over there for?

57:13.569 --> 57:15.070
You can come over,
you know.

57:16.402 --> 57:18.535
Look, I just wanna say
I think you're a legend.

57:19.835 --> 57:21.599
Oh, my God.
How muggy is that?

57:21.601 --> 57:22.999
Right, come on. We're going.

57:23.001 --> 57:25.234
Um, Dad, don't forget
to speak to Denny

57:25.236 --> 57:26.400
'cause she misses you,
all right.

57:26.402 --> 57:27.934
Yeah, all right.

57:30.868 --> 57:32.266
We don't have
that sort of money.

57:32.268 --> 57:35.066
We just have a small cash
and carry business.

57:35.068 --> 57:36.234
Well, they obviously
think you do.

57:36.236 --> 57:39.100
We don't have
a hundred thousand pounds.

57:39.102 --> 57:40.432
Sit down, fellow,
you're giving me indigestion.

57:40.434 --> 57:42.433
Father, please, sit down.

57:42.435 --> 57:44.200
These men are gonna help.

57:44.202 --> 57:46.003
I'm not so sure about that,
fellow. Who are these people?

57:48.902 --> 57:51.332
- I don't know.
- His name's Matthew Taylor.

57:51.334 --> 57:53.069
- Matthew Taylor, who the fuck is that? Do you know?
- No.

57:54.836 --> 57:56.465
Great, so you want me to look
through the Yellow Pages.

57:56.467 --> 57:58.499
If we don't give him
a 100K by Wednesday...

57:58.501 --> 58:00.835
Yeah, he's gonna burn the warehouse down.
I've got that bit.

58:01.969 --> 58:03.134
Look.

58:03.136 --> 58:05.134
They're just a couple of mugs,
ain't they, trying it on.

58:05.136 --> 58:06.103
Are you sure about that?

58:07.836 --> 58:08.869
Well, what do you think?

58:10.434 --> 58:11.769
I don't know, this came
through you, didn't it?

58:17.102 --> 58:19.202
All right. Forty grand.

58:20.535 --> 58:21.733
We can't pay that.

58:21.735 --> 58:24.266
Then it's gonna cost you
ten grand for fucking us about.

58:24.268 --> 58:25.936
Can we get
some more poppadoms please?

59:20.001 --> 59:22.236
So where's the fucking money
then, you smelly cunt?

59:28.568 --> 59:29.770
It's all there?

59:35.235 --> 59:36.836
There is no money.

59:41.267 --> 59:43.034
What the fuck
are you doing here?

59:43.036 --> 59:45.899
I'm looking after
these fellows' best interests.

59:45.901 --> 59:48.133
And what do you know
about that?

59:48.135 --> 59:51.967
Me? I do this for a living, son.

59:51.969 --> 59:53.232
Really?

59:53.234 --> 59:55.500
Because from what I hear,
you're finished.

59:55.502 --> 59:56.535
You lost it.

59:57.969 --> 59:59.269
Game's moved on, old man.

01:00:00.569 --> 01:00:02.132
You see this.

01:00:02.134 --> 01:00:04.199
This don't concern you.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:07.966
So why don't you take
your little firm and fuck off.

01:00:07.968 --> 01:00:09.933
If you're not careful,
I can see you ending up

01:00:09.935 --> 01:00:11.902
like your old friend,
Tony Tucker.

01:00:40.935 --> 01:00:42.567
Who the fuck were they?

01:00:42.569 --> 01:00:44.132
- Did you know them?
- No.

01:00:44.134 --> 01:00:46.465
Yeah, well, they're hardly
fucking no one, are they?

01:00:46.467 --> 01:00:48.332
- Getting sloppy.
- Oh, fuck off.

01:00:48.334 --> 01:00:49.833
You're getting fucking sloppy.

01:00:49.835 --> 01:00:50.934
What's the matter,
you're fucking...

01:00:50.936 --> 01:00:52.399
You do your fucking homework.

01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:54.332
Do your fucking homework.

01:00:54.334 --> 01:00:56.132
Look. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:00:56.134 --> 01:00:57.135
Cunt.

01:01:08.202 --> 01:01:10.066
<i>If you're not careful,
I can see you ending up</i>

01:01:10.068 --> 01:01:12.066
<i>like your old friend,
Tony Tucker.</i>

01:01:16.968 --> 01:01:18.835
<i>You're disgusting.</i>

01:01:35.568 --> 01:01:37.936
Watch the road, girls.
Watch the roads.

01:01:39.434 --> 01:01:40.599
Hello, girls, you all right?

01:01:40.601 --> 01:01:42.065
Yeah.

01:01:42.067 --> 01:01:43.533
Can you give us
a lift, Dad?

01:01:43.535 --> 01:01:44.833
No. I've got to go
to work, babe.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:46.265
I can't be bothered to walk.

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:48.300
Honey, I'm sorry,
I've got work on. Sorry.

01:01:48.302 --> 01:01:49.500
What you doing here?

01:01:49.502 --> 01:01:51.433
I just come to see how you are.

01:01:51.435 --> 01:01:53.032
We're fine.

01:01:53.034 --> 01:01:55.032
You look fucked.

01:01:55.034 --> 01:01:57.200
Well, it's been a long night,
hasn't it? That's all.

01:01:57.202 --> 01:01:59.466
Suggest you go to bed then.

01:01:59.468 --> 01:02:00.867
Come on, girls.
Let's go to school.

01:02:00.869 --> 01:02:02.199
- No, we wanna see Dad.
- Now!

01:02:02.201 --> 01:02:04.499
I haven't
seen him in ages.

01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:06.499
I'm tired. I can't walk.

01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:08.098
<i>Done well to turn
this place 'round.</i>

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.232
I hardly recognize it.

01:02:10.234 --> 01:02:12.567
Where's Shawn?
Given him the night off?

01:02:12.569 --> 01:02:14.567
No. He's doing his own thing.

01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:17.099
You two make a strong team.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:18.366
Yeah. We do all right.

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:20.166
People are aware of that.

01:02:20.168 --> 01:02:23.500
Good. I don't want
people thinking I'm finished.

01:02:23.502 --> 01:02:24.998
I see Denny's moved back in.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:25.935
That's good, isn't it?

01:02:27.335 --> 01:02:28.367
How did you know that?

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:30.133
I seen her and the girls
coming out of the house

01:02:30.135 --> 01:02:32.433
the other morning
when I drove past.

01:02:32.435 --> 01:02:34.870
That's good that
they moved back in with you.

01:02:36.368 --> 01:02:38.900
- I'm not there.
- Oh.

01:02:38.902 --> 01:02:40.966
Sorry. Thought you was.

01:02:40.968 --> 01:02:42.834
No.

01:02:42.836 --> 01:02:44.399
Well, maybe you should
think about it.

01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:46.802
You might be leaving yourself
open, Carlton.

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:51.465
I will. Just been busy,
that's all.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.867
Try not to take on
too much, yeah.

01:02:53.869 --> 01:02:55.535
Then things won't get
so complicated.

01:03:07.902 --> 01:03:09.900
Reg, has someone been
saying something?

01:03:09.902 --> 01:03:11.867
No.

01:03:11.869 --> 01:03:13.935
Just don't go too fast,
that's all.

01:03:15.168 --> 01:03:16.802
Slow down a bit.

01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:19.932
Don't you worry about me.

01:03:19.934 --> 01:03:21.500
I'm not.

01:03:21.502 --> 01:03:23.533
Listen. If someone's
been shooting their mouth off,

01:03:23.535 --> 01:03:25.901
it's probably just some coked-up
plastic wannabe, all right?

01:03:27.201 --> 01:03:28.902
I ain't gonna lose
no sleep over it.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.233
You want a drink?

01:03:37.568 --> 01:03:40.201
Oh, I'm sick of people groping
my arse all bloody night.

01:03:42.168 --> 01:03:43.136
Get paid, don't you?

01:03:44.535 --> 01:03:46.332
It's hard work walking around
in high heels

01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:48.101
and having to deal with
coked-up perverts all night.

01:03:49.935 --> 01:03:51.002
Don't know what
the fucking problem is.

01:03:52.502 --> 01:03:53.935
You're drunk.
Give me the keys.

01:03:55.135 --> 01:03:56.202
Let me drive. Come on.

01:03:57.435 --> 01:03:58.499
I don't wanna fight
with you, Carlton.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.902
Just give me the fucking keys.

01:04:23.467 --> 01:04:24.932
She's really beautiful.

01:04:24.934 --> 01:04:25.968
I don't know why
you're fucking her around.

01:04:27.268 --> 01:04:29.336
Has no one told you, I'm a cunt.

01:04:32.901 --> 01:04:34.166
At least you're honest about it.

01:04:45.434 --> 01:04:47.001
What's this cunt doing?

01:04:50.034 --> 01:04:51.868
What? Why are you going
the wrong way?

01:05:01.034 --> 01:05:02.035
Get down.

01:05:03.335 --> 01:05:04.869
- Get down.
- What?

01:05:06.201 --> 01:05:07.933
Get down!

01:05:07.935 --> 01:05:08.935
What's going on?

01:05:10.435 --> 01:05:12.069
Oh, my God, what's going on?

01:05:24.867 --> 01:05:26.769
Just bring me home.
Just bring me home now.

01:05:29.868 --> 01:05:31.432
We gotta keep active.

01:05:31.434 --> 01:05:33.865
I ain't slowing down for no one.

01:05:33.867 --> 01:05:35.069
That's why we're gonna do him.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.165
His name is Kenny Davis.

01:05:39.167 --> 01:05:41.400
He was sent out to Spain
to pick up seventy grand.

01:05:41.402 --> 01:05:43.365
And he forgot to come back.

01:05:43.367 --> 01:05:45.101
People have been after
this slippery cunt for ages.

01:05:46.201 --> 01:05:47.532
Well, then it'll make us
look good.

01:05:47.534 --> 01:05:50.065
He's hiding out in Portugal.

01:05:50.067 --> 01:05:51.335
We're gonna find him.

01:05:54.135 --> 01:05:55.865
How is it I know this geezer?

01:05:55.867 --> 01:05:57.299
He's that bald-headed mug
who used to work

01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:59.065
on the door at Kudos.

01:05:59.067 --> 01:06:00.865
You know the geezer, the one
who was always letting in

01:06:00.867 --> 01:06:02.299
the fucking 16-year-olds.

01:06:02.301 --> 01:06:03.732
That's right.

01:06:03.734 --> 01:06:06.500
You were in his fucking house that
time to pick up them.

01:06:06.502 --> 01:06:09.533
The geezer who had a load of teenagers
sitting around blowing bubbles.

01:06:09.535 --> 01:06:12.065
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's a fucking nonce.

01:06:12.067 --> 01:06:13.435
Be a pleasure
to carve that cunt up.

01:06:14.835 --> 01:06:16.269
I'm gonna put the kettle on.

01:06:17.867 --> 01:06:19.468
- Is there any beers left?
- No.

01:06:21.402 --> 01:06:24.165
As long as we're a hundred
percent sure he's out there.

01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:27.066
No. I'm just gonna send us all
on a wild fucking goose chase.

01:06:27.068 --> 01:06:28.202
Of course I'm fucking sure.

01:06:31.035 --> 01:06:32.266
I know where he is.

01:06:32.268 --> 01:06:34.200
He's in Villa Morta.

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:35.999
Villa Morta?

01:06:36.001 --> 01:06:38.265
Seventy grand
with all those dirty bastards.

01:06:38.267 --> 01:06:40.232
Be none of it left.

01:06:41.534 --> 01:06:43.432
Lucy, is there a bin?

01:06:43.434 --> 01:06:44.869
Yeah, it's over
beside the fridge.

01:06:48.435 --> 01:06:49.934
Will you get me the milk out
when you're down there?

01:06:56.334 --> 01:06:57.502
Would you like a cup?

01:06:58.468 --> 01:07:00.433
Yeah, go on.

01:07:00.435 --> 01:07:02.035
So is this guy really a nonce?

01:07:03.367 --> 01:07:05.066
Who?

01:07:05.068 --> 01:07:06.536
The guy you're
going out to find?

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:10.436
I don't know.

01:07:11.368 --> 01:07:12.835
I don't care.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.432
I treat them all the same.

01:07:16.434 --> 01:07:18.932
I... I just don't know
how you do it.

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:20.835
I mean, I couldn't hurt anyone.

01:07:22.468 --> 01:07:24.065
I mean, what if you kill him?

01:07:24.067 --> 01:07:25.935
- I won't.
- How do you know?

01:07:27.202 --> 01:07:28.769
I just do.

01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:33.302
Do you remember buying
your first record?

01:07:35.034 --> 01:07:38.102
Yeah it was, um,
Donna Summers' I Feel Love.

01:07:41.068 --> 01:07:42.400
And do you remember
when you were on the way home,

01:07:42.402 --> 01:07:44.935
you were so excited,
because you couldn't wait to listen to it?

01:07:46.168 --> 01:07:47.102
Yeah.

01:07:48.568 --> 01:07:49.869
And then the minute
you get home...

01:07:50.968 --> 01:07:52.934
you get it out the sleeve,
you put it on the deck...

01:07:55.601 --> 01:07:57.101
and you put
the needle down softly.

01:07:59.968 --> 01:08:01.035
And then
you're standing there...

01:08:03.235 --> 01:08:04.369
and you hold your breath.

01:08:07.267 --> 01:08:08.767
And you wait
for the music to begin.

01:08:12.835 --> 01:08:13.902
And then it plays.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.769
You want Donna Summer
to sing forever.

01:08:27.434 --> 01:08:29.136
That's the way I feel
when I have someone over.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.068
If I killed them,
then it'd spoil it.

01:08:48.934 --> 01:08:50.435
I don't want any sugar
in my tea, by the way.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.365
Remind me
to pick up a bottle

01:08:55.367 --> 01:08:56.465
of Chanel for her indoors.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.564
You're a fucking mug.

01:08:57.567 --> 01:09:00.033
Get mine a bar of Toblerone
and she's well happy.

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.832
I mean, I'm not saying
she's fat or anything,

01:09:01.835 --> 01:09:02.966
but I got on top of her
the other night,

01:09:02.968 --> 01:09:04.131
and my fucking ears popped.

01:09:07.367 --> 01:09:08.432
Hello.

01:09:08.434 --> 01:09:10.165
Carlton, where are you?

01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:11.299
<i>Why?</i>

01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:12.599
There's some geezer
parked up outside.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.533
He's been there all morning.

01:09:13.535 --> 01:09:16.002
Eh? Who is he?

01:09:17.468 --> 01:09:18.968
<i>What car is he driving?</i>

01:09:21.468 --> 01:09:23.166
It's a silver Golf.

01:09:23.167 --> 01:09:24.966
Look, I've never seen him before.
I don't know what he wants.

01:09:24.968 --> 01:09:26.502
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm at the airport.</i>

01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:30.532
I don't like this, all right.
He's creeping me out.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.531
<i>He's staring straight at me.</i>

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:35.064
<i>Carlton, I want you
to come home now.</i>

01:09:35.067 --> 01:09:37.098
- <i>Sort this out.</i>
- All right. All right.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.198
All right. All right,
I'll come back, all right.

01:09:39.201 --> 01:09:41.832
- <i>Now.</i>
- Right, just lock the windows...

01:09:41.835 --> 01:09:43.934
Lock the windows, lock the doors,
and I'll come back, all right.

01:09:44.966 --> 01:09:46.435
For fuck's sake.

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:07.802
Are you all right?

01:10:13.234 --> 01:10:14.368
All right, girls.

01:10:18.034 --> 01:10:20.933
Carlton, it's him. It's him.

01:10:20.935 --> 01:10:22.865
Take the girls upstairs.
Now. Come on.

01:10:22.867 --> 01:10:23.899
Girls, go upstairs
with your mum.

01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:26.032
Just go upstairs with your mum.

01:10:26.034 --> 01:10:27.201
Do as she says.

01:10:44.301 --> 01:10:45.435
Are you Carlton Leach?

01:10:46.601 --> 01:10:49.232
Yeah. And who the fuck are you?

01:10:49.234 --> 01:10:51.436
I'm really sorry if I've
caught you at a bad time, but...

01:10:53.835 --> 01:10:55.102
I think you're my dad.

01:11:02.368 --> 01:11:03.369
Matt.

01:11:14.201 --> 01:11:15.301
You better come in.

01:11:39.134 --> 01:11:40.434
Carlton?

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:48.802
Matt, this is my wife, Denny.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:54.002
This is my son.

01:12:00.268 --> 01:12:01.869
This is Matt?

01:12:05.202 --> 01:12:06.336
Hello, mate.

01:12:07.334 --> 01:12:09.266
What's his name?

01:12:09.268 --> 01:12:10.336
Sam.

01:12:11.534 --> 01:12:12.869
That's a good name.

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.033
What's yours?

01:12:16.035 --> 01:12:16.969
Jaime.

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:20.868
- That's a nice name too.
- Thank you.

01:12:22.533 --> 01:12:24.135
- There you go, love.
- Thanks.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.001
Jody, are you not
gonna say hello to Matt?

01:12:28.301 --> 01:12:29.502
Who are you?

01:12:31.135 --> 01:12:32.835
He's your Daddy's son.

01:12:34.035 --> 01:12:35.464
Matt's your brother.

01:12:35.466 --> 01:12:36.833
Don't have a brother.

01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:38.033
You do,
Babes.

01:12:38.035 --> 01:12:38.835
Where have you been?

01:12:40.533 --> 01:12:41.899
I've been on holiday.

01:12:41.901 --> 01:12:43.866
Was there lots of sunshine?

01:12:43.868 --> 01:12:45.066
Yeah.

01:12:45.068 --> 01:12:46.335
You ain't got a tan.

01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:50.802
Do you like boxing?

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:56.302
Yeah. I watched
that fight on the telly.

01:12:57.333 --> 01:12:59.266
It was brutal.

01:12:59.268 --> 01:13:00.202
But he's a legend,
Nigel Benn.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.232
I was there that night.

01:13:03.234 --> 01:13:05.001
Yeah. Me and my mate
Tony walked him out.

01:13:06.367 --> 01:13:08.098
Maybe I saw you.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:09.966
Yeah, well, you can hardly
fucking miss me.

01:13:09.968 --> 01:13:11.068
I was about two
and a half stone heavier then.

01:13:14.101 --> 01:13:16.066
Was you in the ring at the end
when it all kicked off?

01:13:16.068 --> 01:13:17.833
Yeah. Yeah, me
and Tony both were.

01:13:17.835 --> 01:13:19.299
I tell you,
it was fucking mental.

01:13:19.301 --> 01:13:21.935
It was just chaos, mate.
Fucking fists flying everywhere.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.769
- Who's Tony?
- He was my best mate.

01:13:27.967 --> 01:13:30.498
Yeah, he died last year.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.065
Oh, I'm s...
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:13:32.067 --> 01:13:33.101
It's all right.

01:13:36.267 --> 01:13:37.832
You support West Ham?

01:13:37.834 --> 01:13:40.334
Yeah. Just a bit.
When they let me in.

01:13:42.967 --> 01:13:44.498
So how about you then?
You from Watford?

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.233
Do you get down
Vicarage Road?

01:13:46.235 --> 01:13:47.932
No.

01:13:47.934 --> 01:13:49.332
I'm a Spurs fan.

01:13:49.334 --> 01:13:51.932
Fucking front wheel skid.

01:13:51.934 --> 01:13:54.565
My son, a fucking dustbin lid.

01:13:54.567 --> 01:13:57.165
Oh, mate, that's me
being punished that is.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:13:58.966
Give him a break.

01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:00.869
You'll stay for dinner,
won't you, Matt?

01:14:05.234 --> 01:14:06.968
Sorry about that.
Just had to phone work.

01:14:08.967 --> 01:14:10.531
What do you do exactly?

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.136
Security, mainly.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.332
What do you do for work, Matt?

01:14:15.334 --> 01:14:16.899
I'm a gym instructor.

01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:18.464
Oh, yeah?
Carlton's into all that.

01:14:18.466 --> 01:14:19.966
Yeah.

01:14:19.968 --> 01:14:21.432
Can't get into it myself.
I've got too much to do

01:14:21.434 --> 01:14:23.298
getting these buggers
to school in the morning.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:24.431
My wife says the same.

01:14:25.935 --> 01:14:26.999
You want another beer?

01:14:27.001 --> 01:14:28.501
I can't, I'm driving.

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:32.531
Well, just stay.

01:14:32.533 --> 01:14:34.532
We've got a thing in the other
room, just put it down.

01:14:34.534 --> 01:14:36.231
Yeah, it'd be lovely.
Why don't you stay?

01:14:36.233 --> 01:14:37.464
Well, if you're sure.

01:14:37.466 --> 01:14:38.966
Well, you don't wanna go
all the way back

01:14:38.968 --> 01:14:40.299
to fucking Watford tonight,
do you?

01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:42.033
It's miles away.

01:14:42.035 --> 01:14:44.201
Oh that... Yeah,
that-that'd be nice. Thanks.

01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:50.531
Are you two really sisters?

01:14:50.533 --> 01:14:52.331
Yeah.

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.098
Who's the oldest?

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.399
Guess.

01:14:55.401 --> 01:14:57.264
What do you reckon, Mad Jack?

01:14:57.266 --> 01:14:58.398
Couldn't give a flying fuck.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.868
Who's the filthiest?

01:15:01.035 --> 01:15:03.165
- Do you two come together?
- Yeah.

01:15:03.167 --> 01:15:04.298
Oh, I bet you fucking do.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.032
Get rid of them.

01:15:07.034 --> 01:15:09.165
Well, it's been a pleasure
dribbling over you girls.

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:10.267
Now fuck off.

01:15:13.867 --> 01:15:15.832
Whoa, whoa, girls, girls,
look, I'm sorry.

01:15:15.834 --> 01:15:17.565
Look, I'll see you in the club
later or something, yeah?

01:15:17.567 --> 01:15:19.166
Carlton's not coming
out anymore.

01:15:19.168 --> 01:15:21.098
He's got some family stuff
he needs to take care of.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.431
He wants us to flop
on that greedy cunt tonight

01:15:22.433 --> 01:15:23.868
in case he slips off.

01:15:28.266 --> 01:15:30.464
Found a towel for you.
Got a toothbrush.

01:15:30.466 --> 01:15:31.869
Thanks.

01:15:42.967 --> 01:15:43.902
Listen, Matt...

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:47.268
son...

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.801
there's a few things you
don't know about me right now.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:20.231
And I mean we can talk about it
any time, that's no problem.

01:16:35.067 --> 01:16:36.135
It's just...

01:16:37.434 --> 01:16:38.769
Go and wait in the car.

01:16:51.334 --> 01:16:52.869
<i>The kind of work I do...</i>

01:17:04.068 --> 01:17:05.535
<i>...it's probably best
to separate it from you.</i>

01:17:23.401 --> 01:17:25.301
Of course. I understand.

01:17:29.133 --> 01:17:30.300
Thank you.

01:17:32.935 --> 01:17:35.065
Listen...

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.399
have...

01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:37.498
have a good night's sleep, yeah.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.868
I'll see you in the morning.

01:17:45.401 --> 01:17:46.802
Sorry about everything.

01:17:54.066 --> 01:17:54.901
Don't be.

01:17:58.166 --> 01:17:59.368
Goodnight.

01:18:02.166 --> 01:18:03.334
Goodnight, son.

01:18:06.466 --> 01:18:07.768
Carlton.

01:18:10.167 --> 01:18:11.235
Come here.

01:18:56.601 --> 01:18:58.566
Fucking hell. All right,
darling. How you doing?

01:18:58.568 --> 01:19:00.531
- How you going, babe, all right.
- Oh, whoa. Easy. Easy. Easy.

01:19:00.533 --> 01:19:02.264
Mate, all right. Fucking hell.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:14.599
Hey, girls, you want a drink?
Two of them for me please.

01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:16.599
Hey, I want a drink.
I'm sorry, mate.

01:19:16.601 --> 01:19:18.464
Fucking hell. I don't think
much of your one.

01:19:18.466 --> 01:19:19.965
How much is he charging?

01:19:19.967 --> 01:19:21.264
You call me a gay,
you fucking English prick.

01:19:24.334 --> 01:19:26.101
Hello, baby, you all right?

01:19:27.835 --> 01:19:29.232
Oh, look at those
sweet little puppies.

01:19:29.234 --> 01:19:30.566
You gonna take them both,
you greedy cunt?

01:19:30.568 --> 01:19:32.231
Don't know, I might do.

01:19:32.233 --> 01:19:34.598
Where is your mates?
Your sisters, where are they?

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.801
Go and get them?

01:19:36.567 --> 01:19:38.599
They are fucking sisters.

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.934
I'll see you in about five.

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.565
Oy-oy! Let's have a night!

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.235
Fuck!

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.231
Morning.

01:22:03.233 --> 01:22:05.932
Oh, morning, you all right?
Did you sleep well?

01:22:05.934 --> 01:22:07.264
Yeah. Very well.

01:22:07.266 --> 01:22:09.332
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's comfortable, that sofa bed.

01:22:09.334 --> 01:22:11.299
I've had a sleep
on there a few times.

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:12.531
You don't have sugar, do you?

01:22:12.533 --> 01:22:14.067
No, thanks.

01:22:15.234 --> 01:22:16.898
- Morning, love.
- Morning.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.000
Morning, you all right?

01:22:24.533 --> 01:22:26.000
Hello, mate, you all right?

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:30.767
When was this?

01:22:32.568 --> 01:22:33.800
And what about Shawn?

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.067
Fuck's sake,
you got a pen that works?

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:45.900
Have you got a fucking pen?

01:22:47.033 --> 01:22:49.932
Quick. For fuck's sake.

01:22:49.934 --> 01:22:51.502
Yeah, go on, mate.

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:55.398
Yeah. All right.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.767
Stay there, I'm coming out.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.000
- Carlton?
- That toast is burning.

01:23:06.134 --> 01:23:07.101
Hello, mate.

01:23:08.367 --> 01:23:09.531
Yeah, get your stuff
together, all right.

01:23:09.533 --> 01:23:11.332
I've got a job for you.

01:23:11.334 --> 01:23:13.200
Yeah. Right,
I'll be 'round in a bit.

01:23:16.401 --> 01:23:17.964
I can't stay.
I've gotta go the airport.

01:23:17.966 --> 01:23:19.598
- What's happened?
- Look, I can't talk now.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:20.931
Right. I'll phone you
when I get there.

01:23:20.933 --> 01:23:23.132
- Do you want a lift?
- No. No, I'm fine.

01:23:23.134 --> 01:23:24.168
I'm fine.

01:23:39.899 --> 01:23:40.901
I'm sorry, Carlton.

01:23:43.334 --> 01:23:45.164
- Where is he?
- He's in there.

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:46.900
The Old Bill have been
asking questions.

01:23:47.867 --> 01:23:49.232
Who did this?

01:23:49.234 --> 01:23:50.101
I don't know.

01:23:51.467 --> 01:23:52.900
There was too many of them.

01:23:54.367 --> 01:23:55.801
They came out of nowhere.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.566
I came out, I saw
Mad Jack getting attacked,

01:23:58.568 --> 01:23:59.401
I tried to help him.

01:24:01.899 --> 01:24:02.967
I hit the floor
and covered up and...

01:24:04.134 --> 01:24:05.268
Shawn, he...

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.534
he tried to stand and fight.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:11.301
They just kept stabbing him.

01:24:13.534 --> 01:24:15.465
This is serious, Carlton.

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.301
Paramedics said he died twice
on the way here.

01:24:46.899 --> 01:24:49.465
- Have you found these cunts?
- Carlton, no one's seen them yet, all right.

01:24:49.467 --> 01:24:52.031
Now, I've spoken to everyone,
and I've turned the place upside down.

01:24:52.033 --> 01:24:54.399
Mate, they've probably slipped off and
they're out of the fucking country.

01:24:54.401 --> 01:24:56.264
Fuck's sake. This is my fault.

01:24:56.266 --> 01:24:58.831
I should have been here.
I fucking did it again.

01:24:58.833 --> 01:25:00.964
I fucking walked away.
I tell you something, Felix,

01:25:00.966 --> 01:25:02.965
if he dies, I am fucked.

01:25:02.967 --> 01:25:05.865
- Will you get a fucking grip.
- For fuck's sake.

01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:08.498
Now I know you want retribution.
I know you want retribution,

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.864
but you need to let it go, Carlton,
because it will fucking destroy you.

01:25:11.866 --> 01:25:14.566
When I was in the regiment,
I lost guys, Belfast, Ahmar,

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:15.997
never saw
the perpetrator's face,

01:25:15.999 --> 01:25:17.165
and I had to deal with that.

01:25:17.167 --> 01:25:18.432
And you have to deal with it.

01:25:18.434 --> 01:25:20.401
And you need to focus on Shawn.

01:25:21.999 --> 01:25:24.097
Focus on Shawn.

01:25:24.099 --> 01:25:26.067
You need to get
a fucking grip, Carlton.

01:25:29.401 --> 01:25:31.135
<i>At last I found my son.</i>

01:25:32.533 --> 01:25:34.298
<i>But almost lost another friend</i>

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.967
<i>to this violence
that surrounds me.</i>

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.865
<i>To survive in this world,</i>

01:25:44.867 --> 01:25:46.399
<i>you have to be prepared
to fight</i>

01:25:46.401 --> 01:25:48.101
<i>until your lungs fill
with blood.</i>

01:25:52.034 --> 01:25:53.868
<i>I just don't know if I still
have that in me.</i>

01:26:05.566 --> 01:26:07.367
<i>How can I introduce
Matt into this?</i>

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:16.165
<i>How can I expect my son
to bury the father</i>

01:26:16.167 --> 01:26:17.801
<i>he never knew.</i>

01:26:20.034 --> 01:26:22.768
<i>I need to walk away
while I still can.</i>

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.332
I can't believe the
nutter just checked himself out

01:26:37.334 --> 01:26:38.897
after five days.

01:26:38.899 --> 01:26:40.597
Yeah, well,
he ain't keen on hospitals.

01:26:40.599 --> 01:26:43.132
Soon as his lungs started
working, he was up and he was out.

01:26:43.134 --> 01:26:44.832
Well, what's he like now?

01:26:44.834 --> 01:26:47.365
His back looks like
a human knife rack.

01:26:47.367 --> 01:26:48.931
But he'll be all right.

01:26:48.933 --> 01:26:50.097
Do you think
the police will find them?

01:26:50.099 --> 01:26:51.533
No. No chance.

01:26:54.499 --> 01:26:56.597
Can tell you two
are brother and sister.

01:26:56.599 --> 01:26:57.933
Half.

01:26:59.166 --> 01:27:00.435
All right then, half.

01:27:01.201 --> 01:27:02.530
Both got his nose.

01:27:02.532 --> 01:27:03.965
Well, I'd rather that
than his mouth.

01:27:03.967 --> 01:27:05.868
That's charming, isn't it?

01:27:07.267 --> 01:27:09.200
So, are you two back together
now then or what?

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.298
Carlton! Good evening.

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.433
So how's the food?

01:27:13.435 --> 01:27:15.463
I was just saying, isn't it,
It's really, really nice.

01:27:15.465 --> 01:27:16.864
Thanks for inviting us, mate.

01:27:16.866 --> 01:27:18.264
- I appreciate it.
- Well, it's my pleasure.

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.565
It's good to see you, Denny.

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:20.901
Looking as beautiful as ever.

01:27:22.167 --> 01:27:23.897
- He's a lucky man.
- Yeah.

01:27:23.899 --> 01:27:25.265
Oh, yeah.

01:27:25.267 --> 01:27:27.064
Oh, my God, Carly.

01:27:27.066 --> 01:27:28.299
Carly. Carly.

01:27:28.301 --> 01:27:30.497
She looks like such an
independent woman all of a sudden.

01:27:30.499 --> 01:27:32.131
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

01:27:32.133 --> 01:27:33.998
She still knows how to hold
her hand out, don't you?

01:27:35.934 --> 01:27:38.001
- Can you spare your husband?
- You can have him.

01:27:40.266 --> 01:27:42.231
There was a reason
I invited you here tonight.

01:27:42.233 --> 01:27:44.997
And it wasn't to buy you dinner.

01:27:44.999 --> 01:27:47.430
I... You know, us Turks like
to keep things amicable

01:27:47.432 --> 01:27:48.300
when it comes to business.

01:27:49.466 --> 01:27:51.565
And in my country, we say,

01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:53.268
"A thousand friends are too few,

01:27:54.599 --> 01:27:57.800
and one enemy... is too many."

01:28:01.099 --> 01:28:02.967
So go on then.
Who have you upset?

01:28:04.433 --> 01:28:06.368
Not me, my friend. You.

01:28:10.067 --> 01:28:11.534
I'm gonna be straight
with you, Carlton.

01:28:13.866 --> 01:28:15.134
You've upset a family.

01:28:17.899 --> 01:28:19.433
And they've put
a contract out on you.

01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:24.967
Which family?

01:28:35.433 --> 01:28:36.867
- The Nortons?
- Yeah.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.801
Why?

01:28:45.532 --> 01:28:47.098
I tried to vouch
for you, Carlton.

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:48.367
I'm sorry.

01:28:55.099 --> 01:28:56.434
So what you gonna do?

01:29:03.201 --> 01:29:04.301
Set up a meet.

01:29:06.366 --> 01:29:07.931
Tell them I'll go alone, yeah.

01:29:07.933 --> 01:29:09.234
Uh-huh.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.931
You'd do that for me?

01:29:11.933 --> 01:29:13.234
'Course I will.

01:29:14.366 --> 01:29:16.132
'Course I will.

01:29:16.134 --> 01:29:17.268
Okay.

01:29:25.499 --> 01:29:27.165
Are you all right?

01:29:27.167 --> 01:29:28.168
Yeah. Fine.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.064
<i>From the outside,</i>

01:29:49.066 --> 01:29:52.164
<i>it can seem like
a lawless lifestyle.</i>

01:29:52.166 --> 01:29:54.501
<i>but a criminal society's
no different from any other.</i>

01:29:55.867 --> 01:29:58.564
<i>There's an infrastructure
in place.</i>

01:29:58.566 --> 01:30:00.933
<i>A hierarchy
you have to respect.</i>

01:30:02.867 --> 01:30:05.898
<i>The Nortons are the governors.</i>

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.801
<i>If they have a problem with me,
I'm fucked.</i>

01:30:10.967 --> 01:30:12.801
<i>But it's not in my nature
to run.</i>

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.400
<i>The only way
to protect my family</i>

01:30:17.599 --> 01:30:18.967
<i>is to accept what's coming.</i>

01:30:26.599 --> 01:30:28.297
How the fuck did you
get up here?

01:30:28.299 --> 01:30:31.165
- Stairs.
- What, on your own?

01:30:31.167 --> 01:30:32.931
You're unbelievable.
You're supposed to be resting.

01:30:32.933 --> 01:30:34.932
You're gonna end up
breaking your fucking neck.

01:30:34.934 --> 01:30:37.297
Yeah, well, the DJ is getting
on my nerves.

01:30:37.299 --> 01:30:39.263
Why didn't you answer
your phone?

01:30:39.265 --> 01:30:41.067
Well, come on then, your message
sounded urgent, what is it?

01:30:41.999 --> 01:30:43.564
Nothing.

01:30:43.566 --> 01:30:46.199
Just thought I'd see if you
was all right, that's all.

01:30:46.201 --> 01:30:47.997
Well, why didn't you ask me
that on the phone?

01:30:47.999 --> 01:30:49.901
Well, pick up the phone
next time, maybe I will.

01:31:04.834 --> 01:31:06.964
You know when you died
in the ambulance

01:31:06.966 --> 01:31:08.530
on the way to the hospital...

01:31:08.532 --> 01:31:10.231
do you remember it?

01:31:10.233 --> 01:31:12.264
No.

01:31:12.266 --> 01:31:13.497
They say that you do.

01:31:13.499 --> 01:31:15.998
No, don't remember nothing.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.168
- Well, maybe that's it, mate.
- What's that?

01:31:19.867 --> 01:31:22.334
Nothing. That's it.
That's your lot.

01:31:25.834 --> 01:31:27.865
Well, you know,
if you think there's gonna be

01:31:27.867 --> 01:31:29.466
any pearly gates for us,
it ain't gonna happen, mate.

01:31:32.066 --> 01:31:34.031
- You made a will?
- No.

01:31:34.033 --> 01:31:35.531
No, I'm not leaving
nothing behind.

01:31:35.533 --> 01:31:36.868
Well, what about Cayna?

01:31:38.899 --> 01:31:39.901
Well, you know, she's...

01:31:41.566 --> 01:31:43.898
she's with her mother
and her family,

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.199
so she's well looked after,
so don't worry about it.

01:31:47.232 --> 01:31:49.297
You ever think about
knocking it all on the head

01:31:49.299 --> 01:31:50.497
and just going back out there,

01:31:50.499 --> 01:31:51.901
you know, to be with her?

01:31:52.967 --> 01:31:53.700
Yeah, all the time.

01:31:57.566 --> 01:31:59.900
But she's better off
in Thailand.

01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:03.767
Anyway, who'd look after you?

01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.834
I've been putting some
dough away for my kids.

01:32:13.166 --> 01:32:14.267
Yeah?

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.367
What's that?

01:32:32.532 --> 01:32:35.964
That's the number
for a safety deposit box.

01:32:35.966 --> 01:32:38.965
There's not a massive amount
in there, but...

01:32:38.967 --> 01:32:40.467
it'll sort my kids out
for a bit when I'm gone.

01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:46.031
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:32:46.033 --> 01:32:47.767
Just been doing a bit
of thinking, that's all.

01:32:59.433 --> 01:33:01.034
Will you look after that for me?

01:33:02.567 --> 01:33:03.934
Yeah, of course, mate.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:05.834
Cheers.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.434
- Good morning, girls.
- Dad!

01:33:12.599 --> 01:33:14.130
You look smart, don't you, hey.

01:33:14.132 --> 01:33:15.831
Yeah.

01:33:15.833 --> 01:33:17.198
What you doing here?

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.430
Thought I'd come and say hello.
Is that all right?

01:33:19.432 --> 01:33:22.096
Now you're not gonna drive Mrs.
Feather up the wall today, are you?

01:33:22.098 --> 01:33:23.430
- No.
- Good.

01:33:23.432 --> 01:33:25.166
All right. Well,
I'll see you in a bit, yeah?

01:33:26.599 --> 01:33:28.399
- Be good, darling.
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:30.332 --> 01:33:31.834
And you, trouble.

01:34:33.366 --> 01:34:36.364
You're here. Good.

01:34:36.366 --> 01:34:38.832
I'm afraid my brothers won't be
joining us this evening,

01:34:38.834 --> 01:34:41.131
but they do send their regards.

01:34:41.133 --> 01:34:43.767
You got me instead,
the runt of the litter.

01:34:45.433 --> 01:34:47.131
Please take a seat.

01:35:00.333 --> 01:35:01.334
Do you like scotch?

01:35:03.265 --> 01:35:05.096
- Yeah.
- So do I.

01:35:07.934 --> 01:35:11.464
And would you believe it,
so does half of Asia too.

01:35:11.466 --> 01:35:16.030
In fact, the last time I had
a little drop of this stuff...

01:35:16.032 --> 01:35:19.300
I was at the Ritz Carlton
in Bangkok, Carlton.

01:35:20.999 --> 01:35:21.867
Funny that.

01:35:44.366 --> 01:35:45.768
Cheers.

01:35:58.998 --> 01:36:00.032
Essex boy, eh?

01:36:02.834 --> 01:36:03.967
Except you're not, are you?

01:36:05.366 --> 01:36:07.864
You're East End.

01:36:07.866 --> 01:36:12.163
See... the problem with
the lot of them over that way

01:36:12.165 --> 01:36:15.067
is they seem to take
South End literally.

01:36:16.432 --> 01:36:18.231
I mean, it doesn't.
It carries on.

01:36:18.233 --> 01:36:21.334
Paris, Geneva, Monaco, Milan.

01:36:22.833 --> 01:36:24.963
That's why my brothers
like you, Carlton,

01:36:24.965 --> 01:36:26.266
because you understand that.

01:36:28.999 --> 01:36:30.100
So...

01:36:31.833 --> 01:36:34.467
when someone comes to us asking
for you to be taken care of,

01:36:35.998 --> 01:36:37.233
my brothers and I
find it somewhat...

01:36:40.099 --> 01:36:41.266
disturbing.

01:36:42.265 --> 01:36:44.097
Who is it?

01:36:44.099 --> 01:36:47.564
Well, if you'd taken
the time to ask yourself

01:36:47.566 --> 01:36:50.197
that exact question
in the first place,

01:36:50.199 --> 01:36:52.531
and indeed gone about your work
in a more professional way,

01:36:52.533 --> 01:36:53.868
we wouldn't have this problem.

01:36:56.432 --> 01:36:57.500
Instead...

01:37:00.133 --> 01:37:02.130
you blinded someone
who belongs to someone

01:37:02.132 --> 01:37:03.099
who belongs to us.

01:37:05.866 --> 01:37:08.067
Your complacency has left
the family feeling...

01:37:10.499 --> 01:37:11.800
uncomfortable.

01:37:13.898 --> 01:37:15.100
I didn't know.

01:37:16.533 --> 01:37:17.963
- Didn't know...
- They...

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:20.066
Well, you fucking do now!

01:37:32.165 --> 01:37:33.466
A fine single malt...

01:37:35.465 --> 01:37:38.266
is like a complicated woman.

01:37:40.433 --> 01:37:42.464
Needs to be taken seriously.

01:37:42.466 --> 01:37:45.230
The kid had no respect.

01:37:45.232 --> 01:37:47.767
He had no regard for the death
of my good pal Tony Tucker.

01:37:49.599 --> 01:37:52.598
If I saw him again,
I'd take his other eye out.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.100
That's why we're fond
of you, Carlton.

01:37:56.533 --> 01:37:59.398
But you need to show
some control

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:01.534
over the anger you have inside.

01:38:02.965 --> 01:38:05.564
Because violence, my dear,

01:38:05.566 --> 01:38:07.932
will only take you so far
in this world.

01:38:10.533 --> 01:38:12.398
Contract's been taken out.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.063
It can't just be lifted.

01:38:14.065 --> 01:38:16.064
Something needs to be done.

01:38:16.066 --> 01:38:18.264
Done for us. You understand?

01:38:18.266 --> 01:38:21.297
Listen, if you need something
taken care of, I can sort it.

01:38:21.299 --> 01:38:24.067
We already know you're
a leader of men, Carlton.

01:38:26.365 --> 01:38:29.200
But what happens when you look
around and there's no ICF...

01:38:30.532 --> 01:38:32.498
no firm, no army.

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.000
Just you, alone...

01:38:35.333 --> 01:38:37.000
with that fear...

01:38:38.232 --> 01:38:40.497
and self-doubt...

01:38:40.499 --> 01:38:42.131
that keeps you awake at night.

01:38:42.133 --> 01:38:43.200
I don't need anyone.

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:47.096
Good.

01:38:47.098 --> 01:38:49.866
Because you're going
to Rotterdam tonight, alone.

01:38:52.566 --> 01:38:54.166
You will deliver something

01:38:55.366 --> 01:38:59.933
to a very dangerous
and volatile individual

01:39:01.066 --> 01:39:02.564
called Lars Becker,

01:39:02.566 --> 01:39:05.030
who has been a little bit
trigger happy recently

01:39:05.032 --> 01:39:06.100
for our liking.

01:39:07.432 --> 01:39:09.863
Be there
tomorrow night at 10 p.m.

01:39:09.865 --> 01:39:10.966
Someone will meet you.

01:39:12.233 --> 01:39:15.897
Prove you have some control
over the demons you have inside

01:39:15.899 --> 01:39:16.933
and maybe...

01:39:18.465 --> 01:39:20.867
the little problem you've got
will go away.

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:32.534
One other thing.

01:39:34.132 --> 01:39:36.334
It isn't a good idea
to be there when he opens it.

01:39:38.132 --> 01:39:39.399
Or you won't be coming back.

01:40:06.567 --> 01:40:08.030
<i>I always thought</i>

01:40:08.032 --> 01:40:09.766
<i>that Tony was tricked
into death.</i>

01:40:11.399 --> 01:40:14.899
<i>But maybe like me,
he just didn't have a choice.</i>

01:40:23.233 --> 01:40:25.767
<i>But I will die with dignity.</i>

01:40:42.898 --> 01:40:44.930
Where are we going?

01:40:44.932 --> 01:40:45.899
You'll see.

01:41:43.132 --> 01:41:44.199
Get out.

01:42:10.233 --> 01:42:12.930
At last we meet.

01:42:12.932 --> 01:42:16.533
The ICF general
and West Ham's top boy.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.931
It's a shame we didn't come
face to face on the Terraces.

01:42:20.933 --> 01:42:24.000
FC Feyenoord welcomes you
to Rotterdam, Carlton.

01:42:25.833 --> 01:42:28.531
Tell me, how is
the Yid Army these days?

01:42:28.533 --> 01:42:29.899
Same as Ajax.

01:42:31.266 --> 01:42:32.297
Bunch of cunts.

01:42:37.399 --> 01:42:38.932
I believe you've got
something for me.

01:42:53.266 --> 01:42:55.397
We've walked
the same path, you and I,

01:42:55.399 --> 01:42:57.263
from the dogs to the Terraces

01:42:57.265 --> 01:42:59.266
and now we found each other
at the top table.

01:43:01.233 --> 01:43:03.767
No, this is it.
No more.

01:43:06.232 --> 01:43:07.299
I'm getting out.

01:43:09.433 --> 01:43:12.398
I've fulfilled my obligation.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.334
Now can you get one of these
lads to drop me back at the port?

01:43:16.299 --> 01:43:18.830
You'll be walking away
from a lot of money, Carlton.

01:43:18.832 --> 01:43:21.563
The Nortons now have businesses
in Thailand, Cambodia.

01:43:21.565 --> 01:43:24.831
They need people like you and me

01:43:24.833 --> 01:43:26.398
to take control over there.

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.434
No, my family is more important.

01:43:29.565 --> 01:43:31.199
It's a young man's game.

01:43:33.499 --> 01:43:35.031
I'm walking away.

01:43:35.033 --> 01:43:36.832
Retirement is
a fantasy, Carlton.

01:43:38.365 --> 01:43:40.164
You've chosen this life,

01:43:40.166 --> 01:43:41.767
and now it's chosen you.

01:43:43.066 --> 01:43:44.996
When you look into the eyes
of these men,

01:43:44.998 --> 01:43:47.831
you'll see that
they've accepted it too.

01:43:47.833 --> 01:43:50.131
We're all
on borrowed time, Carlton.

01:43:50.133 --> 01:43:52.932
But they enjoy fear
because they understand it.

01:43:54.265 --> 01:43:57.066
Ah. I've lost too many friends.

01:44:00.498 --> 01:44:01.932
I can't do this.

01:44:04.133 --> 01:44:05.234
It's over.

01:44:10.899 --> 01:44:12.564
Take him to the port.

01:44:13.966 --> 01:44:14.766
Come on.

01:44:38.065 --> 01:44:40.166
Don't open it!

01:44:44.432 --> 01:44:46.200
You think you saved my life.

01:44:47.233 --> 01:44:49.200
But in fact...

01:44:53.165 --> 01:44:54.867
you saved your own.

01:45:13.532 --> 01:45:15.867
Welcome to the family, Carlton.

01:45:45.398 --> 01:45:47.333
You all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:45:49.599 --> 01:45:51.366
- Hello, mate, you all right?
- Hi, bruv.

01:45:53.166 --> 01:45:55.231
- You ain't going, are you?
- I'm going nowhere mate.

01:45:55.233 --> 01:45:56.366
See you soon, yeah.

01:46:01.165 --> 01:46:02.429
Oh!

01:46:02.431 --> 01:46:04.298
Arsene, you ginger cunt!

01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:05.867
Pass the fucking ball!

01:46:07.166 --> 01:46:09.096
Fucking mug!

01:46:09.098 --> 01:46:10.297
So where's Cambodia then?

01:46:10.299 --> 01:46:12.231
Near Thailand, you prick.

01:46:12.233 --> 01:46:14.264
Yeah? All those
dirty fucking lady boys,

01:46:14.266 --> 01:46:15.463
you would know,
wouldn't you, you sweaty.

01:46:15.465 --> 01:46:17.864
Fuck you. Prick.

01:46:17.866 --> 01:46:19.530
So when we going?

01:46:19.532 --> 01:46:21.063
We're not.

01:46:21.065 --> 01:46:24.063
I was just explaining
to the boys about our plans.

01:46:24.065 --> 01:46:26.133
Talking of which,
where's your boy today?

01:46:27.232 --> 01:46:28.234
I didn't know you had a son?

01:46:29.364 --> 01:46:31.363
Oh sorry. My mistake.

01:46:31.365 --> 01:46:33.230
He's probably at a Spurs game.

01:46:40.531 --> 01:46:42.362
<i>When you've got family,</i>

01:46:42.364 --> 01:46:43.767
<i>it makes you vulnerable.</i>

01:46:46.165 --> 01:46:47.597
<i>Lars was right.</i>

01:46:47.599 --> 01:46:49.163
<i>I've chosen this life,</i>

01:46:49.165 --> 01:46:50.432
<i>now it's chosen me.</i>

01:46:51.599 --> 01:46:55.000
<i>And the merry-go-round
just turns and turns.</i>

01:46:56.532 --> 01:46:58.896
<i>The only way I'm going
to leave this life</i>

01:46:58.898 --> 01:47:00.832
<i>is when someone
comes along and takes it.</i>
