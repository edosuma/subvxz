00:04.272 --> 00:06.641
EZ: Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:40.508 --> 00:41.676
Guess I'm gonna have
to find another way

00:41.709 --> 00:43.311
to work on my daddy shit.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.580
Take care of yourself, Felipe.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.715
You too, son.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.183
FELIPE: What happened?

00:49.216 --> 00:51.185
I found out about

00:51.218 --> 00:54.154
his DEA deal tonight.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.357
You chose him over me.

00:56.391 --> 00:57.992
You always have.

00:58.025 --> 01:00.395
I come here
with an opportunity.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.996
You help with this,

01:02.029 --> 01:04.732
and you won't need
to accrue points, Ezekiel,

01:04.765 --> 01:07.835
because the deal
will never have existed.

01:07.868 --> 01:11.306
You will be free and clear.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.374
We'll do whatever this thing
for Potter is,

01:13.408 --> 01:15.743
put it behind us,
then you're free to go.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.678
Hand in your cut,
then you leave.

01:17.712 --> 01:19.680
The M.C., Santo Padre.

01:19.714 --> 01:20.915
I don't care where you go.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.353
POTTER:
Los hermanos Reyes.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.722
I've just sent each of you
a text message

01:27.755 --> 01:31.125
with the details
of your task.

01:38.333 --> 01:41.302
(Joshua James's
"Mother Mary")

01:41.336 --> 01:44.171
*

01:47.207 --> 01:53.213
*

01:55.983 --> 01:58.285
* I've walked half
of this country *

01:58.319 --> 02:00.187
* To get to this town

02:00.220 --> 02:03.057
* To put a bill
in my pocket *

02:03.090 --> 02:06.293
* Shake the dirt
from a crown *

02:06.327 --> 02:08.796
* If your worries
are trouble *

02:08.829 --> 02:11.599
* Then your trouble,
it's broke *

02:11.632 --> 02:13.267
* Your bottle is empty

02:13.300 --> 02:16.571
* Now there's blood
on the floor *

02:16.604 --> 02:18.739
* Your bottle is empty

02:18.773 --> 02:22.477
* And there's blood
on the floor *

02:22.510 --> 02:25.145
*

02:25.179 --> 02:28.115
* Well, the colors
ain't mixin' *

02:28.148 --> 02:30.818
* Your tolerance
has run dry *

02:30.851 --> 02:33.454
* So you board up
your windows *

02:33.488 --> 02:35.390
* To make it
through the night *

02:35.423 --> 02:38.626
* They might hunt you
like foxes *

02:38.659 --> 02:41.396
* And sell you as slaves

03:43.023 --> 03:44.925
Miguel...

03:54.168 --> 03:57.104
* Shoes on my feet

03:57.137 --> 03:59.039
* He'd burn these
here bastards *

04:02.076 --> 04:04.879
* He'd put shoes
on my feet *

04:04.912 --> 04:10.184
*

04:10.217 --> 04:13.854
* Mother Mary called

04:13.888 --> 04:15.289
*

04:15.322 --> 04:17.692
* She wants her son's blood

04:17.725 --> 04:20.528
* Washed from the walls

04:20.561 --> 04:23.430
* Mother Mary called

04:23.464 --> 04:25.232
*

04:25.265 --> 04:27.201
* Says she wants

04:27.234 --> 04:30.370
* Her son's blood

04:30.404 --> 04:36.410
* Yeah, washed
from the walls *

04:36.443 --> 04:43.217
*

04:49.423 --> 04:56.296
*

04:57.197 --> 05:00.367
* Mother of exiles

05:00.400 --> 05:02.369
* The torch of hope

05:02.402 --> 05:05.205
* In the toss of the tempest

05:05.239 --> 05:07.575
* Threw us medicine's rope

05:07.608 --> 05:11.345
* But the brazen giant

05:11.378 --> 05:13.147
* With limbs astride

05:13.180 --> 05:16.050
* Blocks the golden door

05:16.083 --> 05:18.953
* To the US of lies

05:18.986 --> 05:20.555
* Screaming

05:20.588 --> 05:23.791
* Damn your huddled masses

05:23.824 --> 05:27.061
* Scrub our floors

05:27.094 --> 05:29.797
* Cut our grasses

05:29.830 --> 05:32.399
* I am a wolf

05:32.432 --> 05:35.269
* A wild cur

05:35.302 --> 05:38.438
* Cut from the pack

05:38.472 --> 05:41.108
* With blood on my fur

05:41.141 --> 05:43.678
* Every howl

05:43.711 --> 05:46.513
* Marks the dead

05:46.547 --> 05:50.117
* 'Cause a beaten dog

05:50.150 --> 05:51.752
*

05:51.786 --> 05:54.154
* Never forgets

05:54.188 --> 05:56.957
*

05:56.991 --> 05:59.660
* Never forgets

05:59.694 --> 06:06.567
*

06:16.243 --> 06:18.713
COCO: Boy Scout left already.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.549
Guess so.

06:28.022 --> 06:31.025
You all right, man?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.460
Yeah.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.469
*

06:45.505 --> 06:48.442
*

06:51.511 --> 06:58.385
*

07:09.730 --> 07:16.603
*

07:24.111 --> 07:26.513
-Pop.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.983
Couldn't reach you
or your brother.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.051
Yeah.

07:31.085 --> 07:32.252
We were in Arizona.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.655
Indian casino.

07:34.689 --> 07:35.956
Okay.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.237
The Serpent.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.472
Yeah, I got it with Angel.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.281
Lot of shit went down
yesterday.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.786
Some of it good for Angel,
the club.

08:07.121 --> 08:08.355
For you?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.727
Potter, the U.S. Attorney...

08:15.462 --> 08:17.732
Told us the favor he needs.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.969
He wants us to kill KJ.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.072
What?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.174
Didn't say why.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.177
Just needs someone
on the outside to do it.

08:30.210 --> 08:33.213
FELIPE: Your cousin said
something, did something.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.383
Got them scared.

08:41.055 --> 08:43.724
DOJ in bed with the cartel.

08:43.758 --> 08:47.261
The last thing they need
is a whistleblower.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.098
Whatever the reason,

08:51.131 --> 08:53.333
they want it done
by the end of the day.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.275
If we don't...

09:01.308 --> 09:04.044
then I'm back inside.

09:04.078 --> 09:07.014
My deal gets exposed,
and Angel and I,

09:07.047 --> 09:09.216
we're fucking done.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.220
You can't do it, Ezekiel.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.025
I can't put it on Angel.

09:20.094 --> 09:22.763
He's in this because of me.

09:22.797 --> 09:25.232
I already fucked him up enough.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.008
Look at me.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.876
Son...

09:37.611 --> 09:39.046
EZ...

09:40.714 --> 09:43.217
You can't let Potter

09:43.250 --> 09:45.853
turn you into a monster.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.022
It's not who you are.

09:51.058 --> 09:54.194
What am I supposed
to do, Pop?

09:54.228 --> 09:56.130
Huh?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.098
*

09:58.132 --> 10:00.600
What am I supposed to do?

10:00.634 --> 10:02.369
*

10:02.402 --> 10:04.972
We'll figure it out, son.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.574
We'll figure it out.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.810
Promise me one thing.

10:09.844 --> 10:12.512
You won't do anything...

10:12.546 --> 10:15.649
not till you hear from me.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.251
Yeah.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.120
-Okay, Pop.
-Promise me.

10:20.154 --> 10:24.258
*

10:24.291 --> 10:25.659
Okay.

10:25.692 --> 10:31.765
*

10:41.441 --> 10:43.277
BISHOP: Where's your brother?

10:45.045 --> 10:47.247
Should be on his way.

10:47.281 --> 10:50.150
I split early.
Had to see my pops.

10:50.184 --> 10:52.887
HANK: Having a pachanga tonight
after Templo.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.890
Think Felipe can hook us up?

10:55.923 --> 10:58.058
CREEPER: Ribs, baby.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.928
-Boatloads.
TAZA: Uh, actually, mix it up.

11:00.961 --> 11:04.098
Feeding 60, 70 people.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.066
-Take the van.
-Okay.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.667
ALVAREZ: Prospect.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.769
While you're out there,
head over to Vicki's.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.639
-Of course.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.142
-I'm good, son.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.484
You riding back already?

11:24.518 --> 11:26.486
After the party.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.443
ANGEL: Chucky,
where's the prospect going?

11:49.476 --> 11:50.777
An errand.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.847
Can you give
a few less details?

11:53.880 --> 11:56.216
-I don't know.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.384
I don't ask.

12:01.088 --> 12:04.658
Something going on with baby
brother we should know about?

12:04.691 --> 12:06.360
Just family shit.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.529
-Nah, he's just road raggy.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.864
Where's Leticia?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.732
Post office.
Picking up packages.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.301
When you see her,
tell her I'm back.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.335
Can doody.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.743
I like that
Johnny "Coco" Cruz.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.860
Where's Potter?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.096
MAN: Not here.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.198
Meetings.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.366
Then maybe you can tell me
why I've been denied access

12:46.400 --> 12:48.035
to the Reyes deal.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.470
And as of this morning,
any files

12:50.504 --> 12:53.240
on my outgoing agent
Kevin Jimenez.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.242
MAN: I wouldn't know.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.743
Yeah, of course not.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.082
When's Potter back?

13:02.116 --> 13:04.751
Sometime before the end
of the day.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.453
Yeah, right.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.235
Hey, what's up?

13:21.268 --> 13:24.271
Okay. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.244
Galindo and I discussed
a lot of things

13:30.277 --> 13:32.146
on the way back last night.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.647
I trust him.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.615
The shit that went down
with the rebels,

13:35.649 --> 13:36.750
it changed him.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.486
Made him stronger.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.122
Working with the cartel
and Los Olvidados,

13:42.156 --> 13:44.524
it'll be a good move
for the Mayans Motorcycle Club.

13:44.558 --> 13:47.127
BISHOP: We'll take that vote
at gran templ tonight.

13:47.161 --> 13:49.929
But on the guns,
we should vote now.

13:51.165 --> 13:52.999
Who's supplying Galindo?

13:53.033 --> 13:55.302
Nestor has
a military contact.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.104
for handguns, small arms.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.005
Anything bigger, cartel gets

13:59.039 --> 14:00.840
from the Israeli in Honduras.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.343
And the Feds know
about these relationships?

14:03.377 --> 14:04.844
ALVAREZ: Yes.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.680
Galindo will continue
doing business with them.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.115
Keep it looking real.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.750
And Sam Crow can supply
the cartel.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.352
Under the radar.

14:12.386 --> 14:14.188
BISHOP: Through us.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.856
Feds will have no idea.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.759
ALVAREZ: Our club has
a relationship with Charming.

14:19.793 --> 14:22.896
Volatile past
but a profitable peace.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.667
I'm gonna make sure that I keep
that promise to Jax Teller.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.171
But it'll be our charter
handling the business

14:31.205 --> 14:32.906
between Galindo and Sam Crow.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.142
So your table has
to be good with it.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.010
Questions?

14:41.248 --> 14:42.516
All in favor?

14:49.356 --> 14:50.990
No opposed.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.461
Good, 'cause Redwood's
on its way down right now.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.664
Gonna show Galindo the merch.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.700
And we'll show those
fucking gueros how to party.

15:10.144 --> 15:13.147
(rock music playing
through radio)

15:13.180 --> 15:14.814
*

15:18.918 --> 15:25.125
*

15:28.295 --> 15:31.398
MAN:

15:35.635 --> 15:37.704
-Oh!

15:37.737 --> 15:39.639
EMILY: You think that's funny?

15:39.673 --> 15:42.242
No, wait!
Stop it!

15:47.781 --> 15:50.317
No.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.788
(peppy music playing
over radio)

16:28.822 --> 16:29.956
*

16:32.058 --> 16:33.660
Hey.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.161
Everything all right?

16:35.195 --> 16:40.600
*

16:40.634 --> 16:43.036
Sounded worried over the phone.

16:43.069 --> 16:46.640
*

16:49.476 --> 16:52.078
Yeah.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.748
I got to talk to you.
Let's go in the back.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.350
Okay.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.719
*

17:06.726 --> 17:08.662
JIMENEZ:
Think you have eyes on you?

17:08.695 --> 17:11.531
Uh, maybe.

17:11.565 --> 17:13.166
Why'd they take your badge?

17:13.199 --> 17:15.902
Why not just a suspension?

17:17.504 --> 17:20.006
Insubordination.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.941
Pissed off the wrong people.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.279
Why you asking me this?

17:25.312 --> 17:28.682
This U.S. Attorney Potter,
is that who you pissed off?

17:30.149 --> 17:32.919
What's going on, Felipe?

17:32.952 --> 17:35.555
You getting pressed?

17:35.589 --> 17:37.757
Uh...

17:37.791 --> 17:41.060
just trying to make sense
out of all of this.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.867
-Well, it doesn't make sense.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.536
You were a cop.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.740
You know it rarely does.

17:53.773 --> 17:59.846
*

17:59.879 --> 18:03.149
I can't imagine how hard
all of this must be for you.

18:03.182 --> 18:06.886
But the fact that they haven't
blown up EZ's deal yet--

18:06.920 --> 18:09.088
it's a good sign.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.758
Means Potter still needs him.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.827
He'll make his points.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.161
*

18:15.194 --> 18:17.464
You know the upside to this...

18:17.497 --> 18:19.999
if there is one?

18:20.033 --> 18:23.169
I realized...

18:23.202 --> 18:25.672
I actually give a shit
about my family.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.207
My pops, too.

18:28.241 --> 18:32.078
*

18:32.111 --> 18:36.015
My boss was right.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.584
It got personal.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.388
That's new for me.

18:41.421 --> 18:47.427
*

18:48.762 --> 18:51.264
What is it?

18:51.297 --> 18:52.466
Felipe?

18:52.499 --> 18:59.373
*

19:02.776 --> 19:04.911
Sorry, I...

19:04.944 --> 19:07.581
it's all, uh...

19:07.614 --> 19:11.250
*

19:11.284 --> 19:13.587
It's all...

19:13.620 --> 19:15.254
hitting...

19:15.288 --> 19:16.623
at once.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.958
JIMENEZ: I understand.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.161
Is there anything
that I can do for you?

19:22.195 --> 19:24.598
No. I'm, uh...

19:24.631 --> 19:28.602
*

19:28.635 --> 19:31.137
You should go.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.339
*

19:33.373 --> 19:35.341
Head north.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.411
*

19:37.444 --> 19:39.379
Be with your family.

19:39.413 --> 19:44.451
*

19:44.484 --> 19:46.252
Yeah.

19:46.285 --> 19:51.324
*

19:56.295 --> 19:59.265
(peppy music playing
over radio)

19:59.298 --> 20:01.134
*

20:01.167 --> 20:03.236
-De nada.

20:03.269 --> 20:08.808
*

20:21.821 --> 20:24.858
*

20:28.327 --> 20:30.564
What are you doing?

20:34.934 --> 20:37.036
You talk to EZ?

20:38.404 --> 20:41.240
About what we have to do?

20:41.274 --> 20:43.610
Yes.

20:44.778 --> 20:47.581
-I'm not sure.

20:47.614 --> 20:51.518
He called to place the club's
order about an hour ago.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.119
Not EZ.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.723
Jimenez.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.726
Do you know how
to contact him?

21:03.563 --> 21:05.532
Tell me, Pop.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.200
I don't know.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.203
If I don't do it, Pop,
he's--he's--

21:10.236 --> 21:12.238
I tried.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.240
I'm sorry.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.444
It made sense, but I...

21:19.913 --> 21:22.682
I couldn't do it.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.819
I wanted to, but...

21:25.852 --> 21:28.421
but I'm not him anymore.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.423
What the fuck
are you talking about?

21:32.826 --> 21:35.161
You and your brother...

21:35.194 --> 21:37.096
*

21:37.130 --> 21:39.666
You can't just kill Jimenez.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.569
I can.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.403
And I have to.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.972
No.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.543
I know why you protected him.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.944
I get it.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.047
*

21:54.080 --> 21:55.815
It hurts, Pop.

21:55.849 --> 21:57.316
*

21:57.350 --> 22:00.920
Knowing how much
you and Mom adored him.

22:00.954 --> 22:03.156
But I'm not fucking stupid.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.959
*

22:05.992 --> 22:07.961
EZ's special.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.362
*

22:09.395 --> 22:11.731
He doesn't belong here...

22:11.765 --> 22:13.767
with me...

22:13.800 --> 22:17.336
in this dead fucking town.

22:17.370 --> 22:20.574
That's why I got to do this.

22:20.607 --> 22:23.142
You were right.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.278
I made my choice,
and I'm good with it.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.980
*

22:30.016 --> 22:34.287
*

22:34.320 --> 22:36.522
Tell me where he is.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.991
Jimenez.
Please, Pop.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.793
Tell me where I can find him.

22:39.826 --> 22:44.698
*

22:54.007 --> 22:55.809
POTTER: Ezekiel.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.411
The hour draws nigh.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.013
I know.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.616
Do you know?

23:04.383 --> 23:07.621
Well, in case you want to know,

23:07.654 --> 23:09.222
I'm sending an address.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.958
Your, uh, task
has a lunch date.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.862
Should keep him there
for the next hour or so.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.865
After that, he'll be
on the move...

23:18.898 --> 23:20.566
and I may have
to farm out the job

23:20.600 --> 23:23.202
to another independent player.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.038
-That leaves you and Angel--
-I know.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.006
I'll handle it.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.244
Hmm.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.635
(children chattering
indistinctly)

24:23.763 --> 24:25.531
Shit.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.781
Angel?

24:44.550 --> 24:46.786
-Sorry, cuz.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.322
-Let's go.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.090
-It's okay, it's okay.
-BOWEN: What the hell

24:51.124 --> 24:53.392
-Shit.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.132
No, no!

25:48.014 --> 25:50.649
POTTER: I wasn't expecting
ninja-level work,

25:50.683 --> 25:52.485
but this...

25:52.518 --> 25:54.821
Little sloppy, boys.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.689
You knew his boss
would be here.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.594
I didn't plan it,
but, yes, I monitored the call.

26:01.627 --> 26:04.130
Knew he might still be here.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.299
The, uh...

26:06.332 --> 26:09.735
outcome, although not ideal,

26:09.769 --> 26:11.270
it is manageable.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.206
You can tell that
to their families.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.673
They can think about that

26:14.707 --> 26:16.275
the next time they eat
a piece of pie.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.582
Think this is homemade?

26:23.616 --> 26:25.751
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

26:25.785 --> 26:28.254
How do you get away
with this?

26:30.089 --> 26:33.692
All the gatekeepers
have been fired, Ezekiel.

26:33.726 --> 26:36.395
Or resigned, trying to salvage

26:36.429 --> 26:38.464
what's left of their souls.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.301
There are no longer
any obstacles

26:42.335 --> 26:45.238
between avarice
and executive order.

26:45.271 --> 26:48.942
The only limitations
are, uh...

26:50.276 --> 26:52.511
The imagination and...

26:52.545 --> 26:54.480
conscience of the, uh...

26:56.082 --> 26:58.084
Man with the task.

27:03.857 --> 27:06.259
So, to work.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.862
Uh, there have been
no 911 calls

27:08.895 --> 27:11.764
about shots fired,
so your, uh, disposal

27:11.797 --> 27:13.366
should go smoothly.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.735
POTTER: Um, we'll take care
of the vehicles.

27:16.769 --> 27:20.606
Uh, I would suggest using
Galindo's underground freeway

27:20.639 --> 27:22.942
to, uh, get them
to the other side.

27:24.477 --> 27:25.879
Deep hole, please.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.014
I'll need proof.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.752
What about the blood?

27:33.786 --> 27:36.990
There will be no blood.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.200
Let me know when you're done.

28:14.227 --> 28:16.629
Store-bought.
Hmm.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.697
Shame.

28:22.035 --> 28:25.004
(smooth Latin music playing
over radio)

28:25.038 --> 28:31.911
*

28:40.719 --> 28:42.788
This a good time?

28:42.821 --> 28:44.857
Uh, yes.

28:44.890 --> 28:50.329
*

28:50.363 --> 28:52.231
Shit.

28:52.265 --> 28:54.367
-Uh...

28:54.400 --> 28:55.901
15 maybe.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.337
Yeah, your brother...

28:58.371 --> 29:00.473
Yeah, he loved that car.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.141
The faster, the better.

29:02.175 --> 29:08.381
*

29:08.414 --> 29:09.815
Sit.

29:09.848 --> 29:12.018
*

29:15.021 --> 29:18.091
You know,
as this shift happens--

29:18.124 --> 29:22.161
the show for the Feds,
the play with the rebels--

29:22.195 --> 29:25.931
my inner circle will need to
get bigger and more inclusive,

29:25.965 --> 29:28.401
and that can cause...

29:28.434 --> 29:31.904
hierarchy issues,
make people feel marginalized.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.573
So I'm reorganizing

29:34.607 --> 29:37.010
to avoid confusion.

29:37.043 --> 29:37.977
*

29:38.011 --> 29:40.113
Yeah, makes sense.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.647
*

29:41.680 --> 29:43.082
Good.

29:43.116 --> 29:44.817
You'll still be
my head of security,

29:44.850 --> 29:49.088
handle all protection details
for me and my family.

29:49.122 --> 29:52.058
But, uh, in the field,

29:52.091 --> 29:54.427
I'm going to let
my consejero handle

29:54.460 --> 29:57.263
any conflict that may arise.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.633
He'll be as much of a general
as he is an advisor.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.468
*

30:02.501 --> 30:04.470
Mikey, I don't understand.

30:04.503 --> 30:08.274
*

30:08.307 --> 30:10.209
Listen...

30:10.243 --> 30:11.610
*

30:11.644 --> 30:14.247
Your decision to beat
a nun to death

30:14.280 --> 30:15.881
with a baseball bat
and dump her

30:15.914 --> 30:18.151
in a baptismal font...

30:18.184 --> 30:21.820
although effective,
it lacked...

30:21.854 --> 30:23.389
vision.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.891
*

30:25.924 --> 30:28.894
We'll be playing
a dangerous game of chess

30:28.927 --> 30:32.631
on a three-dimensional board,

30:32.665 --> 30:36.035
and I worry
about your level of skill

30:36.069 --> 30:38.571
moving around
the most volatile pieces.

30:38.604 --> 30:42.175
*

30:42.208 --> 30:44.443
Look, it'll all make sense.

30:44.477 --> 30:50.449
*

30:50.483 --> 30:52.085
Hey.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.120
You're like a brother
to me, Nestor.

30:54.153 --> 31:01.026
*

31:07.733 --> 31:09.502
I'm supposed to be back soon.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.806
I picked up Alvarez's bag,

31:13.839 --> 31:15.974
ordered the meat from Pop.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.578
We just wasted two Feds...

31:19.612 --> 31:22.681
and you're worried about
being late to the party?

31:24.117 --> 31:27.486
This is fucked up,
little brother.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.256
It wasn't supposed
to go down this way.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.191
If I didn't show up,
you'd probably be dead.

31:32.225 --> 31:34.627
Then that's on me!

31:34.660 --> 31:36.762
I'm the one who fucks up.

31:40.299 --> 31:43.636
I can't keep seeing everything
as a mistake, Angel.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.339
All I do is chase the repair.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.874
It's fucked up, I know.

31:51.610 --> 31:56.382
I got to start believing
that this is my life...

31:58.384 --> 32:00.519
That some of this shit
is supposed to happen.

32:00.553 --> 32:02.355
It is.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.391
To me.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.877
ANGEL: Shit.

32:24.910 --> 32:27.280
-Oh, shit.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.092
Do you remember him
from when we were kids?

32:40.125 --> 32:41.627
EZ: No.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.463
Not really.

32:45.498 --> 32:49.134
All I remember was this...

32:49.168 --> 32:52.405
Fourth of July party,
barbecue...

32:54.473 --> 32:56.442
His old man slapped
the shit out of him

32:56.475 --> 32:59.412
because he spilled relish
on our tablecloth.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.079
Yeah.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.686
Good times.

33:22.468 --> 33:25.471
You've been busy.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.874
EMILY: Yes.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.325
My Cristobal...

33:49.228 --> 33:51.597
Did you know?

33:55.501 --> 33:57.970
What happened that day
in the study between you,

33:58.003 --> 34:00.839
Miguel, and Devante...

34:02.908 --> 34:04.343
I never knew about it.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.347
EMILY:
Miguel kept that secret...

34:08.381 --> 34:11.717
until he found out
it was a lie.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.486
Then he told me.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.654
I would never make Miguel--

34:15.688 --> 34:18.291
Dita, you made a choice...

34:18.324 --> 34:21.159
from outside the circle.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.896
So now you're feeling it.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.534
That's the way it works, right?

34:38.577 --> 34:40.546
I'll let you work.

34:46.585 --> 34:53.191
*

34:53.225 --> 34:56.194
(men chattering in Spanish
indistinctly)

34:56.228 --> 35:00.533
*

35:08.441 --> 35:15.314
*

35:26.925 --> 35:33.799
*

36:13.305 --> 36:20.178
*

36:33.792 --> 36:35.794
I'm gonna drop you
at the storm drain.

36:35.828 --> 36:39.965
*

36:39.998 --> 36:41.800
Where you going?

36:41.834 --> 36:45.237
It's where you're going
that matters.

36:45.270 --> 36:48.941
After Templo, you tell Bishop
you're done.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.810
Then you pack your shit;
you leave in the morning.

36:51.844 --> 36:56.214
*

36:56.248 --> 36:58.984
It'll be the last fucking grave
you ever dig.

36:59.017 --> 37:05.824
*

37:49.535 --> 37:52.304
ADELITA:
Walk with me.

38:01.246 --> 38:03.315
It's nice.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.752
-Quiet.
-Yeah.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.362
What's wrong, Angel?

38:20.999 --> 38:24.069
Shit with my brother.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.238
Just...

38:26.271 --> 38:27.573
history.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.677
We can choose our family,

38:31.710 --> 38:33.579
but not our blood.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.816
Something like that.

38:48.661 --> 38:51.196
I'm glad you're safe.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.069
It'll be nice having you
in one place for a while.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.805
Not needing a sat phone,

38:59.838 --> 39:02.440
GPS, or a bloodhound
to find you.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.957
I'll check in on you
later this week.

39:23.528 --> 39:26.031
Buenas noches, querida.

39:30.803 --> 39:32.437
Angel.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.844
Do you want to stay?

39:40.579 --> 39:42.848
Spend the night?

39:47.586 --> 39:49.588
More than you know.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.895
Not on a night
when I hate myself this much.

40:24.289 --> 40:25.624
Hmm.

40:42.207 --> 40:45.110
We do love our gadgets.

40:56.188 --> 40:57.555
Reyes.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.958
Zero-zero-zero.

40:59.992 --> 41:02.427
Edward-red-colon.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.563
Sam-Susan-Peter-colon-47.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.936
Execute command 9-2-9.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.984
All doors open, all eyes shut.

41:26.018 --> 41:28.721
*

41:28.754 --> 41:32.557
-That's it.

41:32.590 --> 41:39.464
*

41:41.800 --> 41:44.903
Oh, EZ, um...

41:44.937 --> 41:47.806
the task was to remove
one problem.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.175
Um, removing two,

41:50.208 --> 41:52.644
it did makes things
a bit more complicated.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.446
But no worries.

41:54.479 --> 41:57.449
I've taken care of it.

41:57.482 --> 42:00.953
Let's just say you owe me one.

42:00.986 --> 42:07.159
*

42:07.192 --> 42:10.162
(car door closes,
engine turns over)

42:10.195 --> 42:17.069
*

42:32.751 --> 42:35.520
Hey.

42:35.553 --> 42:39.224
Your pop just pulled up
with the meat and stuff.

42:39.257 --> 42:42.027
Hey, Boy Scout.
Look at your sponsor.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.896
Got himself some new flash.

42:43.929 --> 42:47.065
Our new secretario.

42:49.001 --> 42:50.035
CREEPER: EZ.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.670
-Beers.
-Yeah.

42:56.441 --> 42:58.443
GILLY:
Let's go. Light it up.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.082
Come on, bro, don't be shy.
Pass that over here.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.591
ALVAREZ:
Put it in the books.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.460
We'll talk about it later.

43:22.567 --> 43:23.969
Thanks.

43:33.078 --> 43:36.014
Excuse me.

43:36.048 --> 43:38.083
Can I talk to you
for a second?

43:39.517 --> 43:41.887
You all should hear this.

43:43.055 --> 43:44.789
Sit.

44:25.130 --> 44:26.731
What happened?

44:26.764 --> 44:28.333
It's done.

44:30.702 --> 44:32.070
EZ?

44:36.741 --> 44:38.543
It was all me.

44:40.512 --> 44:42.580
The golden boy
is free and clear.

44:44.716 --> 44:47.319
You can help him pack
his shit in the morning.

44:47.352 --> 44:48.786
Angel.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.326
That all of it?

44:55.327 --> 44:57.129
Yeah.

45:08.573 --> 45:11.043
BISHOP: You sure about this?
-Yeah.

45:11.076 --> 45:13.045
I'm sure.

45:13.078 --> 45:15.647
ALVAREZ:
Does your brother know?

45:15.680 --> 45:17.482
Yeah, we talked.

45:17.515 --> 45:19.384
Okay.

45:20.618 --> 45:22.654
I get it.

45:22.687 --> 45:24.189
Thank you.

45:33.865 --> 45:36.168
ALVAREZ: Primo.

45:36.201 --> 45:38.870
-Sit down.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.241
I need to talk to you.

45:52.684 --> 45:55.620
(rousing music playing
over radio)

45:55.653 --> 46:02.560
*

46:12.304 --> 46:14.272
*

46:14.306 --> 46:17.009
-My Reaper brothers.
-Running Deer.

46:17.042 --> 46:19.978
HANK: How was the ride?

46:20.012 --> 46:22.047
Too long and too hot.

46:22.080 --> 46:24.916
You guys aware you live
in a fucking desert?

46:24.949 --> 46:27.419
Yeah.

46:29.087 --> 46:32.257
-Great to see you.
-Let's have a drink.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.359
Let's go, prospect.

46:48.740 --> 46:51.676
(Waylon Jennings'
"Don't You Think")

46:51.709 --> 46:58.616
*

47:14.366 --> 47:18.936
* I'm for law
and order *

47:18.970 --> 47:21.873
*

47:21.906 --> 47:25.077
* The way that it should be

47:25.110 --> 47:27.179
*

47:27.212 --> 47:30.348
* This song's about

47:30.382 --> 47:33.685
* The night they spent

47:33.718 --> 47:36.221
* Protecting you

47:36.254 --> 47:38.156
* From me

47:39.991 --> 47:44.262
* Someone called us outlaws

47:44.296 --> 47:46.264
*

47:46.298 --> 47:50.001
* In some old magazine

47:50.034 --> 47:52.670
*

47:52.704 --> 47:55.873
* New York sent

47:55.907 --> 47:58.610
* A posse down

47:58.643 --> 48:03.115
* Like I ain't never seen

48:03.148 --> 48:05.517
*

48:05.550 --> 48:08.686
* Don't you think this

48:08.720 --> 48:11.055
* Outlaw shit

48:11.089 --> 48:13.291
*

48:13.325 --> 48:17.729
* Has gotten out of hand?

48:17.762 --> 48:21.133
* What started out

48:21.166 --> 48:24.669
* To be a joke

48:24.702 --> 48:28.740
* The law don't understand

48:28.773 --> 48:30.242
*

48:30.275 --> 48:32.810
* Was it singing

48:32.844 --> 48:36.013
* Through my nose

48:36.047 --> 48:39.851
* That got me busted

48:39.884 --> 48:42.420
* By the man?

48:42.454 --> 48:44.156
*

48:44.189 --> 48:46.023
* This ain't it

48:46.057 --> 48:50.595
* This outlaw shit

48:50.628 --> 48:55.099
* Has gotten out of hand

48:55.133 --> 48:56.534
*

48:56.568 --> 48:59.036
* Out of hand

48:59.070 --> 49:05.943
*

49:09.113 --> 49:10.882
* We were wrapped up

49:10.915 --> 49:14.018
* In the music

49:14.051 --> 49:16.254
*

49:16.288 --> 49:19.457
* That's why we never saw

49:19.491 --> 49:22.627
*

49:22.660 --> 49:25.397
* Cars pull up

49:25.430 --> 49:27.599
* The boys get out

49:30.668 --> 49:34.406
* Filled up with law

49:34.439 --> 49:38.976
* They came bounding
through the back door *

49:39.010 --> 49:41.078
*

49:41.112 --> 49:44.148
* In the middle

49:44.182 --> 49:46.518
* Of my song

49:46.551 --> 49:48.253
*

49:51.289 --> 49:55.227
*

49:55.260 --> 49:56.828
Later, mami.

50:02.467 --> 50:05.437
*

50:05.470 --> 50:07.472
You earned that.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.173
*

50:09.207 --> 50:11.343
Thanks, Pres.

50:11.376 --> 50:14.679
*

50:14.712 --> 50:17.849
-Yeah.

50:17.882 --> 50:20.418
*

50:20.452 --> 50:22.520
Makes sense.

50:22.554 --> 50:25.523
*

50:25.557 --> 50:27.492
We'll add it to our bylaws.

50:27.525 --> 50:30.662
*

50:30.695 --> 50:33.164
Blood can't sponsor blood.

50:33.197 --> 50:36.368
*

50:36.401 --> 50:38.169
I don't understand.

50:38.202 --> 50:41.973
Well, that's why your brother
asked me to sponsor him.

50:42.006 --> 50:44.876
Said the family shit
was fucking with both of you.

50:44.909 --> 50:46.578
*

50:46.611 --> 50:48.346
Yeah.

50:50.848 --> 50:52.517
Yeah, it is.

50:57.322 --> 51:01.259
*

51:01.293 --> 51:04.128

speaking indistinctly)

51:04.161 --> 51:06.631

51:30.322 --> 51:32.290
Marcus.

51:32.324 --> 51:35.527
-Bienvenido.
-Thank you.

51:35.560 --> 51:37.061
*

51:37.094 --> 51:39.664
-Mrs. Galindo.
-Emily, please.

51:39.697 --> 51:42.467

51:51.208 --> 51:52.143
ALVAREZ: Sí.

51:58.249 --> 52:01.218
(rock music playing
over radio)

52:01.252 --> 52:08.125
*

52:15.132 --> 52:17.635
What the fuck
are you doing?

52:17.669 --> 52:20.372
-We had a deal.
-No, we didn't.

52:20.405 --> 52:23.441
-You had a demand.
-Yeah.

52:23.475 --> 52:24.976
And you're gonna fucking do it.

52:25.009 --> 52:26.978
No. I'm not.

52:27.011 --> 52:29.947
*

52:29.981 --> 52:33.585
Everything I did
on the inside...

52:33.618 --> 52:36.153
it was survival.

52:36.187 --> 52:38.122
All about me.

52:38.155 --> 52:40.725
Getting my life back.

52:43.327 --> 52:45.497
Since I've been out,
it--it's been about you...

52:45.530 --> 52:49.033
-And Pop and the club.

52:49.066 --> 52:51.836
I don't know who the fuck
I am anymore, Angel,

52:51.869 --> 52:54.472
or what I should be doing.

52:54.506 --> 52:57.141
But I know I'm not supposed
to run.

52:59.544 --> 53:01.913
So I'm not going anywhere.

53:03.881 --> 53:07.318
If you want to blow me up...

53:07.351 --> 53:10.121
rat me out...

53:10.154 --> 53:11.222
have at it.

53:13.591 --> 53:15.593
But this shit?

53:16.694 --> 53:19.163
-This shit I've earned.
HALLORANN: Hey.

53:21.666 --> 53:24.301
Sorry, man.
Do you have any other beer?

53:24.335 --> 53:27.038
All you got is that
Dos Quacky shit.

53:29.741 --> 53:31.375
Yeah.
What do you need?

53:31.409 --> 53:35.513
My sponsor just wants, like,
a Heiny or a Miller.

53:35.547 --> 53:36.948
Yeah.

53:36.981 --> 53:38.282
I'll get you some.

53:38.315 --> 53:41.619
-By the van.

Help!

ANGEL: That's the whole
fucking point, Ezekiel.

54:09.781 --> 54:12.484
It's fucked up. You--you--
you can't figure it out.

54:12.517 --> 54:15.653
It's not
a fucking math problem.

54:15.687 --> 54:17.388
