WEBVTT

01:35.095 --> 01:37.097
Oh, jackpot.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.817
-

01:54.323 --> 01:56.367
Get the hell away from my cans!

01:56.450 --> 01:59.578
-Them cans is mine.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.294
Now, I done told you,
them cans is mine!

02:13.092 --> 02:15.427
-

02:37.199 --> 02:39.827
-

02:45.249 --> 02:47.126
SHAWNA:
Summer. This one started out

02:47.209 --> 02:50.462
just like the last one
and the one before that.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.089
Taking the bus to the Quarter,

02:52.172 --> 02:55.175
sneaking up onto some
bougie hotel rooftop

02:55.259 --> 02:58.387
and watching my best friend
Pedro get a tan.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.139
Um, when did you get all that?

03:00.222 --> 03:01.932
Get all what?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.272
Okay, what you need to do
is flaunt them shits.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.190
They’re way cuter than
those little mosquito bites

03:10.274 --> 03:11.901
you was working with
last summer.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.360
You’re not even
supposed to like boobs.

03:13.444 --> 03:15.362
I never said I liked them, mami.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.367
Why don’t you get
some of this sun?

03:20.451 --> 03:22.453
I’m not trying to get no darker.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.803
SHAWNA: We didn’t know it yet,
but this summer...

03:39.887 --> 03:41.847
this summer was about to be

03:41.931 --> 03:44.767
very, very different.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.518
"Different" ain’t even the word.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.687
I guess what I’m trying to say
is this summer,

03:48.771 --> 03:52.483
the summer my whole world got,
like, messed-up beyond belief,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.693
the summer I got breasts,

03:54.777 --> 03:58.906
that was the same summer
I fought vampires.

05:19.028 --> 05:20.904
PEDRO: Ooh, I’m so excited
about tonight.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.489
What you got going till then?

05:22.573 --> 05:24.491
SHAWNA: Got to go see my mom.
Trying to roll?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.702
To Ombreux? Mm, no, thanks.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.370
It’s not that bad.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.582
But it really is, though.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.375
You excited about tonight?

05:33.459 --> 05:36.003
Beaucoup cute boys.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.130
Trades, you feel me?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.508
Platinum Percy’s spinning.
You love to dance.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.886
Not in front of other people.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.929
That why you didn’t try out
for the dance team?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.639
No, I didn’t try out
for the dance team

05:47.723 --> 05:50.059
’cause 90% of the girls
they pick are Creole.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.560
There’s a certain look.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.312
Okay, that just means
ten percent ain’t Creole,

05:53.395 --> 05:54.980
-so that’s all you.
-

05:55.064 --> 05:57.441
Since when did you become
a life coach all of a sudden?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.443
Don’t you have your own stuff
to figure out?

05:59.526 --> 06:00.819
Like?

06:00.903 --> 06:03.655
Like a full scholarship
to a great boarding school

06:03.739 --> 06:05.407
with a nationally ranked
track team.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.494
Yeah, but it’s in Texas, though.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.953
So?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.789
So, if I leave New Orleans,

06:11.872 --> 06:13.499
is it really even
New Orleans anymore?

06:13.582 --> 06:15.626
Like, can this bitch survive
without me?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.211
Oh, my God.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.962
And who’s gonna be here
to educate your ign’ant ass

06:19.046 --> 06:20.798
about our city’s
magnificent history and culture?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.008
Who’s gonna remind you
that we did not host

06:23.092 --> 06:24.384
the country’s first Mardi Gras

06:24.468 --> 06:26.136
but we did put on
the first opera?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.513
And who’s gonna explain to you

06:27.596 --> 06:29.098
why po’boys got to be
on stale bread?

06:29.181 --> 06:31.475
Okay, I get it, Professor.
You staying.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.228
Plus, my family, you know.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.690
So, this party tonight?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.237
I don’t have anything to wear.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.489
Hell nah. No, you are not
backing out on me.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.741
We show up together,
we leave together, and we dance

06:47.825 --> 06:50.119
with as many cute boys
as we can in between.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.829
What time we meeting?

06:52.955 --> 06:54.665
Depends on when my dad
gets off of work.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.543
What time, Shawna?

06:57.626 --> 07:00.045
Like... 7:00-ish, maybe.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.255
All right, bitch. 7:00.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.842
Don’t be late.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.177
See you.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.141
-

07:12.224 --> 07:14.560
Yo. What’s going on, partner?

07:14.643 --> 07:17.062
my site to show me love...

07:17.146 --> 07:19.273
Save the Ombreux!

07:19.356 --> 07:21.275
Save the Ombreux! That’s right!

07:21.358 --> 07:23.443
OLD MAN: You’re never too young
to start fighting

07:23.527 --> 07:24.778
for what you deserve.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.238
If not now, then when?

07:26.321 --> 07:28.157
If not us, then who?

07:28.240 --> 07:29.908
ACTIVIST:
Save the Ombreux!

07:29.992 --> 07:31.827
SHAWNA: If you would’ve
asked me back then,

07:31.910 --> 07:34.079
I would’ve told you
these people are crazy.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.206
Like, don’t they have
anything better to do?

07:36.290 --> 07:38.917
I mean, the Ombreux
was hardly worth saving.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.547
Besides the fact that
it was falling apart,

07:43.630 --> 07:46.049
this shit had basically become
a one-stop shop

07:46.133 --> 07:47.509
for sellers and users.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.720
If you weren’t
slangin’ or coppin’,

07:49.803 --> 07:52.097
you didn’t have
any business there.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.809
I was probably
the only normal person

07:55.893 --> 07:57.978
who ever came out this way.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.443
Or maybe not.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.362
-Mm, that’s Chris Thompson.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.741
Junior, popular, cool, fun,

08:10.824 --> 08:13.202
and the absolute last person
I expected to see

08:13.285 --> 08:15.245
walking into the Ombreux.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.665
-

08:34.723 --> 08:37.059
-

08:40.938 --> 08:42.814
Come on. Come on.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.191
H-Hey, Mommy.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.529
I, uh...
I brought you some stuff.

08:50.781 --> 08:51.823
Any money?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.284
I’m not supposed to be
bringing you...

08:54.368 --> 08:58.247
I just need to buy some Tampax.

08:58.330 --> 09:01.458
What, I need permission from
your father to do that, too?

09:04.920 --> 09:07.798
I know I put a dollar
in here somewhere.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.224
Um...

09:17.307 --> 09:20.018
I’ll just leave these here,
I guess.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.271
Shawna, wait.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.993
I’m sorry I hollered at you.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.869
It’s just...

09:37.953 --> 09:41.540
things your father put
in your head about me, they...

09:42.916 --> 09:44.668
I’m better.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.920
I-I’ve been better
for months now.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.591
Well, then...

09:53.343 --> 09:55.220
...maybe you could just
come home, then.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.972
Oh, uh-uh.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.682
Ain’t that easy, baby girl.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.148
You been watching my plants
while I’ve been away?

10:06.231 --> 10:07.941
Jamal has.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.070
And they ain’t died yet?

10:12.154 --> 10:14.281
Mm-mm.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.534
He do know that zebra plant
need light all day?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.703
It’s tropical.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.629
-I miss you.
-

10:30.839 --> 10:32.382
We all do.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.137
I miss y’all, too.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.642
Hey, uh...

10:50.317 --> 10:52.319
Yeah.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.321
I look at these pictures
every night

10:54.404 --> 10:57.324
and pray to Jesus
I can come home.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.372
My friends say,
"Girl, sell that thing.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.791
You know how much money
you could get?"

11:05.874 --> 11:09.628
But I ain’t never
gonna sell this.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.057
Um...

11:23.642 --> 11:26.603
You got any money for Mama?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.022
Even just a dollar?

12:26.997 --> 12:29.416
-

12:34.880 --> 12:37.299
gold bottles, gold letters

12:37.382 --> 12:39.301
Late Night with Letterman

12:39.384 --> 12:42.053
the winning was better, man

12:45.682 --> 12:47.642
STEVEN:
And dinner is served.

12:47.726 --> 12:51.354
Hey, Jamal, go ahead and turn
off that music if you could.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.234
JAMAL:
Dad, what is that?

12:56.318 --> 12:57.777
That is a casserole.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.113
Are you sure?

13:01.156 --> 13:02.365
Sit. Eat.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.659
-JAMAL: All right.
-

13:10.457 --> 13:13.168
Dad, do you think maybe
Mom could come home soon?

13:13.251 --> 13:15.670
I mean, maybe she’s better.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.215
Or maybe she could be better
if she was here.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.009
Your mom’s got some stuff she
needs to figure out on her own.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.595
-If she cared, maybe she’d try
a little harder. -Hey.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.138
She cares, all right?

13:25.222 --> 13:28.016
It’s just, she’s been through
a lot since the storm.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.018
The storm? That’s her excuse?

13:30.101 --> 13:32.062
Dad, that was like 15 years ago.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.272
Yeah, well, she’s still hurting.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.858
Lot of folks are.
Show some respect.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.071
I saw Chris today, J.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.073
-STEVEN: Who’s Chris?
-Just a boy.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.909
-A boy?
-SHAWNA: No...

13:45.992 --> 13:47.827
JAMAL:
A boy who ain’t feeling her.

13:47.911 --> 13:48.912
How you know?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.497
’Cause Chris got
mad light-skinned

13:50.580 --> 13:51.706
Creole girls with wavy hair.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.583
-And?
-Look how dark you is.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.169
You look like
Wesley Snipes with braids.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.964
Jamal. You gonna give
the girl a complex.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.424
JAMAL:
My bad. Sorry.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.759
STEVEN:
Yeah, you’ll be sorry all right.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.177
You understand?

14:04.261 --> 14:05.637
You’re gonna be sorry.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.931
And you too young
to be worrying about boys.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.015
Eat.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.184
Both of you.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.189
-"Creole girls." Ridiculous.
-

14:16.273 --> 14:17.732
Wesley Snipes.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.526
don’t give me that, no

14:19.609 --> 14:21.319
-

14:21.403 --> 14:22.654
-

14:24.030 --> 14:25.031
some more...

14:26.366 --> 14:28.034
Excuse me.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.287
when you wiggle low

14:30.370 --> 14:32.372
wiggle low

14:32.455 --> 14:34.040
wiggle low...

14:34.124 --> 14:36.501
-What are you doing?
-I’m trying to help you out.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.962
You look crazy, girl--
like, legit homeless.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.214
You know, next time,
you getting ready at my house

14:41.298 --> 14:43.466
so I can approve beforehand,
’cause just...

14:43.550 --> 14:47.012
-Ew, no, no.
-Okay, okay, I get it.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.390
SHAWNA:
It was him again.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.766
Chris.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.852
Those eyes, those lips.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.104
Ooh, those muscles!

14:56.187 --> 14:58.648
Even his hair was perfect.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.234
Oh, my God. I admit it, yeah.

15:01.318 --> 15:04.070
I was thirsty.

15:06.656 --> 15:09.242
You got exactly 30 seconds to
go over there and holla at him,

15:09.326 --> 15:11.953
or I’m not gonna talk to you
for the rest of the summer.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.580
What are you even talking about?

15:13.663 --> 15:16.916
Bitch, don’t even try me,
’cause you know I ain’t playing.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.376
Pedro.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.545
29, 28,

15:20.629 --> 15:24.174
27, 26...

15:25.467 --> 15:28.345
-Hey, what about...
-25, 24,

15:28.428 --> 15:30.972
23, 22...

15:31.056 --> 15:32.432
-CHRIS: I’m telling y’all.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.017
-Hey, Chris.
-We do this every weekend.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.477
Saints game, I promise y’all.
And then New Year’s.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.562
Like, y’all don’t,
y’all don’t really understand...

15:37.646 --> 15:38.897
Hey, Chris!

15:40.440 --> 15:42.108
Hey.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.694
Uh, hey. Do I know you?

15:44.778 --> 15:47.238
Uh, yeah.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.740
Yeah, we met before.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.409
I’m-I’m Shawna,
Jamal’s little sister.

15:51.493 --> 15:54.162
-Oh. Right.
-

15:57.582 --> 15:59.542
You’re on the dance team, right?

15:59.626 --> 16:00.710
-Mm-hmm.
-

16:00.794 --> 16:03.004
Like, that’s really cool.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.007
SHAWNA:
Um...

16:06.091 --> 16:09.469
I think I saw you today
over at the-the Ombreux.

16:09.552 --> 16:10.887
No.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.389
Ombreux? Nah.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.557
Nah.
-Yeah, it was definitely you.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.185
Um, maybe, like,
around 4:00, maybe...

16:17.268 --> 16:20.605
I said nah,
that-that wasn’t me, man.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.195
Okay.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.406
Yeah, I just wanted to, um...

16:29.489 --> 16:30.990
I just wanted to come over here

16:31.074 --> 16:32.784
and just tell you
that I liked your shape.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.373
I liked your shirt.
I liked your shirt.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.254
Um...

16:44.337 --> 16:46.256
yeah, I just...
I just wanted to come over here

16:46.339 --> 16:48.967
and tell you that, so I’ll,
uh... I’ll see you around.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.219
All right, Samantha.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.096
Be easy.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.725
PEDRO: Oh, you won’t
have to take me there.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.310
SHAWNA:
I was so stupid.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.563
I should’ve just stayed home.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.356
Two big lessons from that night:

17:03.440 --> 17:06.818
think before
you shoot your shot,

17:06.901 --> 17:10.029
and never walk home alone.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.948
Pedro.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.658
Sorry to dip on you like that.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.702
I just wasn’t feeling
that party.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.454
I probably shouldn’t
have even come.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.832
It was stupid of me to even
think that I could just...

17:20.915 --> 17:23.168
Just...

17:23.251 --> 17:25.962
You know what?
Just-just hit me back.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.968
-Yo, help a brother out!
-

17:32.051 --> 17:33.970
I don’t...
I don’t have anything.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.480
SHAWNA: Why they always
asking me for money?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.565
Dang.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.252
-

18:06.336 --> 18:08.671
What the...

18:08.755 --> 18:10.131
Hey!

18:10.215 --> 18:12.842
Hey, leave him alone!

18:40.912 --> 18:43.248
SHAWNA:
His skin was freezing.

18:43.331 --> 18:47.335
Felt like-- I don’t know--
leather or something.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.212
Cold leather.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.549
-

19:14.696 --> 19:17.031
-

19:17.115 --> 19:19.534
Am I crazy?
Did that really just happen?

19:19.617 --> 19:22.203
Was I bitten by a... vampire?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.420
Vampires are for real?

19:30.503 --> 19:33.089
I can’t even believe
I’m asking that.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.345
Sunlight, I knew, was bad.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.022
I didn’t want to turn
into a bat or nothing

19:49.105 --> 19:51.190
while I was asleep.

19:54.777 --> 19:59.574
So I decided it was best
to stay awake.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.286
-

20:07.415 --> 20:08.666
You’re up early.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.751
Uh, couldn’t sleep.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.127
Nightmares?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.254
Something like that.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.966
Hey, what happened to your neck?

20:17.050 --> 20:19.552
Uh, curling iron.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.643
Who did this?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.227
I did, I guess.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.480
You’re too old to be tearing up
the house like this, Shawn.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.564
Wait, wait.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.696
Get some sleep, Shawn,

20:38.780 --> 20:41.658
after you take down
the rest of this.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.214
What?

20:56.297 --> 21:01.427
Took me a minute to figure out
what to do, what to say.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.681
I get how I would’ve sounded.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.767
Still, I knew what I saw,
and I knew what happened to me.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.691
Hola, Shawna.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.117
Back from the dead. A miracle.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.077
You know, I’ve been
hitting you up, chica.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.412
I know. I know.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.622
Um, can we talk?

21:30.331 --> 21:32.375
In private.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.299
-Okay, no way.

21:40.383 --> 21:44.012
Get off my iPad.
Go read a book or something.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.141
See why I can’t
leave this place?

21:48.224 --> 21:50.727
-Everyone would be illiterate.
-

21:53.813 --> 21:55.732
So, what did you want
to talk about?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.109
Okay. If I tell you
what I have to tell you,

21:58.192 --> 21:59.777
you can’t call me crazy,

21:59.861 --> 22:02.030
and you have to promise
to believe me no matter what.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.990
-You’re freaking me out.
-Promise!

22:04.073 --> 22:06.242
Dios mío. I promise.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.037
Okay.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.039
That night, after the party,

22:11.122 --> 22:14.292
I was walking home, and, uh...

22:14.375 --> 22:15.960
I got, uh...

22:16.044 --> 22:18.713
-Spit it out!
-I-I got attacked.

22:18.796 --> 22:21.466
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.218
-Are-are you o... -By a group
of homeless vampires.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.145
-Bitch, is you smoking?
-You promised.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.272
Okay, uh, maybe I should
just walk you out.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.356
No.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.524
Look.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.943
-It won’t heal right.
-

22:41.027 --> 22:43.488
-What is that?
-I told you, I got attacked.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.615
-Are you sure it wasn’t,
like, a dog? -Hmm-mm.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.200
Homeless vampires.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.870
Shawna, mami, you probably,
like, blacked out

22:50.953 --> 22:53.456
and had some, like,
crazy delusion or whatever.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.208
You might got the rabies.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.376
Homeless vampires.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.755
Well, I guess that at least

23:00.838 --> 23:02.882
explains why they bit you,
right?

23:02.965 --> 23:04.258
What?

23:04.342 --> 23:06.219
You looked extremely homeless
that night.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.055
Hello. I’m joking.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.474
-There’s no... -No, they must’ve
realized I wasn’t homeless.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.893
That’s why they let me go
and kept biting that other dude.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.728
-What other dude? What?
-You know, the dude, the dude...

23:15.812 --> 23:17.730
the dude that’s always begging
for change over on Benton.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.440
Oh, you mean Mr. Ooh-Wee?

23:19.524 --> 23:21.067
-He’s just a crackhead.
-Okay, well, homeless people,

23:21.150 --> 23:22.819
bums, crackheads,
whatever you want to call it,

23:22.902 --> 23:24.737
that’s who they’re after.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.825
Well, if they’re after
crackheads...

23:28.908 --> 23:31.077
If they’re going
after crackheads, then what?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.537
Um...

23:35.873 --> 23:37.375
OLD MAN:
And what goes in its place?

23:37.458 --> 23:40.044
-WOMAN: Mm-hmm.
-OLD MAN: Mixed-use development?

23:40.128 --> 23:41.504
WOMAN:
That’s right.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.922
OLD MAN: That’s code for
"we’re not invited."

23:43.005 --> 23:45.049
This is it. This-this is...

23:45.133 --> 23:47.426
PEDRO: Shawna, there’s
no such thing as vampires.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.187
Mom?

23:58.271 --> 23:59.689
What?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.983
Where could she be?

24:03.317 --> 24:05.361
Where’d she go?

24:13.035 --> 24:14.996
Mom?

24:59.957 --> 25:02.627
Mom. Mom.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.505
Mom!

25:08.716 --> 25:09.759
See? She’s fine.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.346
-Let’s go.
-Listen, Mom.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.139
You got to come back home now.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.808
Okay? We’ll figure it out
later with Dad,

25:17.892 --> 25:20.353
but it ain’t safe for you
to be living like this anymore.

25:21.729 --> 25:24.482
You-you need anything else?

25:26.734 --> 25:28.527
Where’s your necklace?

25:30.571 --> 25:32.156
You know what?

25:32.240 --> 25:34.033
It doesn’t matter.
We’ll come back for that.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.952
Right now we just need to...

25:36.035 --> 25:37.745
PEDRO:
Oh, my God.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.876
That doesn’t mean anything.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.003
Y-You’re all right.

25:46.087 --> 25:48.756
Look. Look. I got it, too.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.425
See? See?

25:51.509 --> 25:53.094
I’m all right.
We both all right.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.846
Just because you got bit,

25:55.930 --> 25:58.599
that doesn’t mean anything.
I...

25:58.683 --> 26:00.268
Cold leather.

26:07.692 --> 26:10.027
Shawna! Watch out! Watch out!

26:12.154 --> 26:15.032
-Oh, my God!
-PEDRO: Stop! Stop.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.243
-Move! Move! Move, Shawna!

26:17.326 --> 26:19.412
We got to move! Mami, mami, no!

26:19.495 --> 26:21.497
Mami, no, no! Move!

26:27.586 --> 26:29.046
SHAWNA
No. Oh, my God.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.631
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Mami.

26:30.715 --> 26:33.718
-Mami, we got... we got to go.
-No.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.572
SHAWNA: The cops didn’t know
whether to call it

26:54.655 --> 26:58.743
a homicide or a suicide
or an accident,

26:58.826 --> 27:01.287
but I knew exactly
what to call it.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.039
It was murder.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.166
I didn’t know who or what
was responsible,

27:05.249 --> 27:07.501
but I was gonna make ’em pay.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.423
No matter what,
they were gonna pay.

27:21.724 --> 27:25.061
-

27:33.444 --> 27:36.447
SHAWNA: This is what
you wanted to show me?

27:36.530 --> 27:38.115
An empty lot?

27:40.743 --> 27:42.745
This is the house.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.830
Was the house

27:44.914 --> 27:48.876
where me, your mom and Jamal
stayed before Katrina.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.712
Finally tore it down
a few years back.

27:51.796 --> 27:54.423
And they cram us all down
on the floodplains,

27:54.507 --> 27:57.176
knowing all they got to do
is wait for the next storm

27:57.259 --> 27:59.178
just to press the reset button.

28:00.471 --> 28:04.141
It’s not like we’re much
better off where we are now.

28:04.225 --> 28:07.311
Another big one hits,
we’ll be in the same boat.

28:07.395 --> 28:08.604
No pun intended.

28:23.119 --> 28:25.454
Shawn, I brought you here
to talk about your mom

28:25.538 --> 28:26.831
and how we should remember her.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.040
Dad, we don’t
have to get into...

28:28.124 --> 28:29.667
No, no, we-we do.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.168
Okay? It’s important.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.048
You know, she was grown,
so ultimately,

28:36.132 --> 28:38.134
she’s responsible
for her mistakes.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.721
Lord knows there were
plenty of those.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.768
But history matters.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.856
It was so chaotic after Katrina.

28:53.983 --> 28:58.737
The help she needed
just wasn’t there,

28:58.821 --> 29:00.823
and it never came.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.287
Look, I’m not saying
things were perfect before.

29:07.538 --> 29:10.291
I’m just saying
things definitely got worse.

29:11.876 --> 29:14.587
And who knows how bad
it would’ve gotten

29:14.670 --> 29:17.173
if it wasn’t for you?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.884
-Me?
-That’s right.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.887
She was pregnant
when the storm hit.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.764
She called you her miracle baby.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.059
She said you saved her life.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.437
And I think she was right
about that.

29:38.027 --> 29:40.362
I had to hide it when she left
so she wouldn’t...

29:44.658 --> 29:46.494
She’d want you to have it.

29:49.747 --> 29:52.625
Uh, the police found that one.

29:55.669 --> 29:57.087
Listen, Shawn.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.466
You’ve got to be brave now.

30:01.592 --> 30:05.054
This city, this world--
it takes bravery.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.597
Okay?

30:19.360 --> 30:22.905
SHAWNA: I needed to know the
rules of the game I was playing.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.449
Lucky for me,
New Orleans is full of people

30:25.533 --> 30:28.202
obsessed with monsters
and magic and stuff.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.538
I reached out to
this white girl named Granya.

30:30.621 --> 30:33.874
She hosted a vampire book club
thing in an abandoned church.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.627
-Weird, but I needed info,

30:36.710 --> 30:38.754
and I’d get it any way I could.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.965
Anne Rice, huh?
She’s from New Orleans.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.008
Hometown hero.

30:43.092 --> 30:46.595
Oh, my God, this must be what
McAdams Academy looks like.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.305
What you mean?

30:48.389 --> 30:50.182
PEDRO: Let’s just say
I’m not super excited

30:50.266 --> 30:52.977
about being surrounded by a
bunch of white folks from Texas.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.020
It’s not like they’re gonna
roll out the welcome wagon

30:55.104 --> 30:56.689
for an immigrant kid
from Mexico,

30:56.772 --> 30:58.107
no matter how fine I am.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.192
-GRANYA Okay.

31:00.276 --> 31:02.486
-See you guys next time.
-Bye.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.530
GRANYA:
Hey, you must be Shawna.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.240
I’m Granya.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.534
So, are you guys interested
in the world of vampire fiction?

31:08.617 --> 31:10.077
Don’t know much about fiction,

31:10.160 --> 31:12.538
but I do have
some questions for you.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.629
That’s a very loaded question.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.631
There’s really no consensus

31:22.715 --> 31:24.842
how someone gets turned
from human to vampire.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.928
Okay, but can you just walk me
through some of the basics?

31:28.012 --> 31:29.555
Well, there’s
the school of thought

31:29.638 --> 31:31.599
that you have to be drained
of all human blood

31:31.682 --> 31:33.934
and have it totally replaced
with vampire blood.

31:34.018 --> 31:36.270
Ooh, or...

31:37.396 --> 31:39.398
...there’s a line of thinking

31:39.481 --> 31:41.066
that you have to be bitten
and the venom

31:41.150 --> 31:42.651
has to overtake your system
and that’s all.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.028
Sorry to interrupt y’all,

31:44.111 --> 31:45.613
but why do you meet
in a place like this?

31:45.696 --> 31:47.740
Like, why not go
to someplace less weird,

31:47.823 --> 31:49.074
like a library?

31:49.158 --> 31:51.577
The girls like the vibe--
it’s gothic--

31:51.660 --> 31:53.329
and they give us
the room for free.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.955
Oh, but you’re not, like,
a witch or whatever?

31:55.039 --> 31:56.332
Presbyterian.

31:58.042 --> 32:00.794
Is there anything you can
tell me that’s, like, for sure--

32:00.878 --> 32:03.505
narrow it down, why one person
would turn into a vampire

32:03.589 --> 32:06.091
but another wouldn’t,
even if they both got bit?

32:09.136 --> 32:10.804
They have to die.

32:10.888 --> 32:12.765
That’s what all the stories
have in common.

32:12.848 --> 32:16.310
So, to become a vampire,
you have to die?

32:16.393 --> 32:17.895
If the character doesn’t die,

32:17.978 --> 32:20.105
I don’t see how
they can become a vampire.

32:20.189 --> 32:22.232
They’d just be
a person who survived.

32:22.316 --> 32:23.734
Okay.

32:23.817 --> 32:26.028
And how can a vampire die again?

32:26.111 --> 32:27.905
Besides, like, sunlight.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.573
Well, I mean, sunlight
is highly debatable.

32:29.657 --> 32:32.242
Trust me, mami, no, it ain’t.

32:32.326 --> 32:36.455
Uh, besides sunlight,
there’s fire and decapitation,

32:36.538 --> 32:38.123
wooden stake through the heart.

32:38.207 --> 32:40.209
Okay, and what if you wanted
to catch a vampire

32:40.292 --> 32:41.960
but, like, just keep it alive?

32:42.044 --> 32:43.837
Why would anyone
want to do that?

32:43.921 --> 32:47.007
Yeah, Shawna, why would
anyone want to do that?

32:50.427 --> 32:52.680
You weren’t serious in there.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.139
Mami, we almost died
last time...

32:54.223 --> 32:56.058
My mom did die, ’Dro.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.482
What do you need me to do?

33:06.360 --> 33:09.238
We need everything on this list.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.657
Everything.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.284
PEDRO:
Garlic, stakes and a Bible.

33:14.368 --> 33:15.619
Shawna.

33:15.703 --> 33:17.746
Except don’t worry
about the silver chains.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.665
I can take care of that.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.843
Oh.
-CHRIS: Oh.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.344
Um, hey.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.638
My mom wanted me
to bring these to y’all.

33:34.722 --> 33:36.640
Red beans and rice.

33:36.724 --> 33:38.892
She’s sorry she missed
the repass.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.311
Thanks.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.566
Uh, come in.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.950
You know, she said she used
to kick it with your mom

33:55.033 --> 33:56.285
in the Calliope,

33:56.368 --> 33:59.830
play spades and shit,
before they tore it down.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.039
I ain’t know that.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.332
Yeah, me, neither.

34:05.127 --> 34:08.297
I guess that sort of
makes us peoples.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.716
-Guess so.
-

34:16.263 --> 34:19.224
-Jamal around?
-Mm-mm.

34:19.308 --> 34:22.811
Do, uh, they know
what went down yet?

34:23.729 --> 34:26.023
Nah, not yet.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.984
Do they think it was, like...

34:29.067 --> 34:31.653
Did somebody kill her?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.572
She wouldn’t have
done it to herself.

34:35.199 --> 34:38.660
Look, if you or Jamal
ever catch wind

34:38.744 --> 34:41.538
of any nigga that might’ve had
something to do with it,

34:41.622 --> 34:43.123
I got y’all’s back.

34:43.207 --> 34:45.125
Mm-hmm.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.090
Chris.

34:52.174 --> 34:54.092
You for real about
having my back?

34:54.176 --> 34:55.302
Yeah.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.304
OLD MAN:
If they tear down the Ombreux,

34:57.387 --> 34:58.597
what will we do?

34:58.680 --> 34:59.848
Where will we go?

34:59.932 --> 35:01.433
They’re taking everything
from us:

35:01.517 --> 35:03.852
our low-income houses,
our jobs...

35:03.936 --> 35:05.687
What you think of that dude?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.481
I think he crazy.

35:07.564 --> 35:08.649
Maybe.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.900
He ain’t wrong, though.

35:09.983 --> 35:11.860
-He ain’t?
-Me and you, we lucky.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.654
We don’t got to stay
in the projects.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.656
But a lot of people,
this all they got.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.199
The Ombreux?

35:17.282 --> 35:18.826
I mean, I guess.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.702
Why you think
so many people left

35:20.786 --> 35:22.579
after the storm
and never came back home?

35:22.663 --> 35:24.248
Ombreux’s the last
of the bricks.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.333
I mean, where people
’posed to live?

35:26.416 --> 35:28.585
Well, like you said,

35:28.669 --> 35:31.171
lucky for us,
we got another place to stay.

35:31.255 --> 35:33.173
For now.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.343
SHAWNA:
Did you get it?

35:36.426 --> 35:38.095
-Uh...
-Chris, this is ’Dro.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.097
’Dro, this is Chris.

35:41.557 --> 35:43.517
Uh, can I talk to you
real quick, mami?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.435
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.273
Okay, what is he doing here?

35:49.356 --> 35:51.859
We’re not exactly the strongest,
fastest people in New Orleans.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.610
I hold, like,
three city-wide track records.

35:53.694 --> 35:55.028
You know what I mean.

35:55.112 --> 35:56.780
-Does he know about...
-Not yet.

35:56.864 --> 35:59.074
Shawna, I really don’t think
right now is the right time

35:59.157 --> 36:00.701
for you to be making
a love connection.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.578
I’m not making
a love connection. I-I...

36:02.661 --> 36:04.830
So, uh, the guy that did it,
where’s he at?

36:04.913 --> 36:06.915
Okay, I don’t know
if he did it or not,

36:06.999 --> 36:09.585
but he might know who did.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.879
Same shit. Let’s go.

36:13.422 --> 36:15.299
SHAWNA
Right.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.307
PEDRO:
Maybe we should just go.

37:06.767 --> 37:09.394
Are you sure
dude even stays here?

37:10.938 --> 37:12.940
How did you even
find out ’bout him?

37:13.023 --> 37:14.441
Just a hunch, I guess.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.526
A hunch?

37:17.736 --> 37:18.946
-

37:19.029 --> 37:20.489
CHRIS:
Shit.

37:21.865 --> 37:23.700
Probably just a...

37:24.993 --> 37:27.162
...rat, right?

37:27.245 --> 37:29.247
Maybe we should just go.

37:29.331 --> 37:31.249
Geez, ’Dro,
you always got to be...

37:31.333 --> 37:34.211
-

37:44.388 --> 37:48.016
-

38:01.947 --> 38:03.824
CHRIS:
So you killed your own mom?

38:05.075 --> 38:06.076
Yeah.

38:06.159 --> 38:08.120
Well, no, I mean...

38:08.203 --> 38:10.789
It-it’s really whoever’s
responsible for making her...

38:10.872 --> 38:12.624
A vampire.

38:13.834 --> 38:14.960
Fuck.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.336
Okay, you shouldn’t
have brung him.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.046
You don’t drop shit
like that on people.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.589
He’ll be fine.
I mean, it’s just...

38:19.673 --> 38:22.259
It’s just a lot
to j-just, like, process.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.345
And what about our other amigo?

38:25.429 --> 38:27.973
Time to get some answers.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.518
MARVIN:
I don’t know that damn woman!

38:32.477 --> 38:34.062
Old Marvin never turned nobody.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.273
-If not you, then who?
-Uh...

38:36.356 --> 38:38.650
now, if I tell you,
they’re gonna kill old Marvin.

38:38.734 --> 38:40.193
Again.

38:40.277 --> 38:43.238
CHRIS: What makes you think
we won’t kill you, nigga?

38:43.321 --> 38:45.907
For someone who hates himself,
you sure looked happy as hell

38:45.991 --> 38:47.701
when you was about to chomp down
on a nigga’s neck.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.078
Oh, man, I...
I couldn’t help it, bruh.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.371
I ain’t ate in days.

38:51.455 --> 38:52.998
Who’s turning people
into vampires?

38:53.081 --> 38:55.208
Oh...

39:02.424 --> 39:04.885
Y’all had garlic in there?

39:04.968 --> 39:07.054
Y’all-y’all playing foul, bruh.

39:07.137 --> 39:10.265
Don’t-don’t...
don’t come no closer.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.309
-What’s it feel like?

39:12.392 --> 39:15.187
You been tear-gassed
by the police?

39:15.270 --> 39:18.774
No, but I’m guessing by
your nosebleed I don’t want to.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.569
Tell us what we want to know.

39:22.652 --> 39:25.614
-

39:28.283 --> 39:30.368
-Straight like that.
-Okay.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.412
Okay, okay, I’ll tell you.

39:33.914 --> 39:36.166
Just get that shit
away from me, man.

39:37.959 --> 39:41.379
It’s this nigga named Lefrak.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.090
He building an army.

39:43.173 --> 39:44.800
-An army for what?
-I...

39:44.883 --> 39:47.427
I don’t know, but any homeless

39:47.511 --> 39:50.555
or any addict down on his luck,
that’s who he’s enlisting.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.265
How do we get to him?

39:52.349 --> 39:54.434
You can’t.
He don’t fuck with humans.

39:54.518 --> 39:56.561
He got to eat, right?
Human blood?

39:56.645 --> 39:58.605
Where does he stay?
Where does he stay?!

39:58.688 --> 40:00.023
-

40:00.107 --> 40:02.359
An old mansion
down in the French Quarter.

40:02.442 --> 40:06.071
He’s always got that
red Escalade parked out front.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.367
Truth be told,

40:10.450 --> 40:13.870
I hope you get
Lefrak’s bitch ass.

40:15.539 --> 40:18.083
’Cause if he dies,

40:18.166 --> 40:21.002
they say we all
turn back to normal.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.212
You think that’s true?

40:22.295 --> 40:24.172
Too bad you won’t
be alive to find out.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.674
-Huh? -We let you go,
next thing you know,

40:25.757 --> 40:27.634
we up on some vampire hit list.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.261
Oh, no, no.

40:29.344 --> 40:30.720
How you kill
one of these bitches?

40:30.804 --> 40:31.847
Wait. Hold up.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.682
No one said nothing
about no murder.

40:33.765 --> 40:34.975
I think we use a wooden stake.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.560
-PEDRO: What?
-What?

40:36.643 --> 40:39.271
Shawna, what are you doing?

40:39.354 --> 40:41.148
Chris is right, ’Dro.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.191
We can’t have him snitching
before we get to Lefrak.

40:43.275 --> 40:44.568
Get to Lefrak? Mami...

40:44.651 --> 40:46.069
-

40:47.863 --> 40:49.948
I ain’t gonna drop
a dime on you, baby.

40:50.031 --> 40:53.285
Old Marvin
never turned on nobody.

40:55.829 --> 40:57.956
SHAWNA:
I have to get to Lefrak, ’Dro.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.583
And if this works,
I’m-a put a stake

40:59.666 --> 41:02.043
-right through his heart, too.
-Come on, bruh.

41:02.127 --> 41:05.463
Y’all can’t do me like this.

41:05.547 --> 41:08.133
-Through the heart, right?
-

41:08.216 --> 41:10.343
Guys, let’s just
think this through.

41:10.427 --> 41:12.762
Yeah!
Let’s think this thing through.

41:12.846 --> 41:14.139
-I untie you right now...
-Shawna.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.765
...tell you
you can have every drop

41:15.849 --> 41:18.518
of his sweet Mexican blood,
what you do?

41:30.363 --> 41:32.866
I told you.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.043
SHAWNA:
Wait.

41:43.126 --> 41:45.337
This is my beef.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.130
I should do it.

41:47.214 --> 41:49.257
You sure?

41:50.550 --> 41:53.220
No, not really.

41:53.303 --> 41:55.388
But I gotta.

41:55.472 --> 41:56.932
Get him, then, killer.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.850
PEDRO:
Shawna.

42:00.310 --> 42:03.146
Come on.
Do you really want to do this?

42:09.319 --> 42:12.697
-

42:12.781 --> 42:15.575
-

42:34.427 --> 42:35.553
Hmm.

42:37.847 --> 42:39.349
Huh.

42:41.017 --> 42:42.269
Hmm.

42:58.952 --> 43:01.454
Yo, can I holla at you
for a second?

43:02.831 --> 43:04.499
Look, I don’t do surprises,

43:04.582 --> 43:06.918
especially not surprises
about monsters and shit.

43:07.002 --> 43:08.503
Look, I’m sorry.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.839
Look, obviously,
it won’t ever happen again.

43:10.922 --> 43:13.049
Give me your phone.

43:16.219 --> 43:18.346
Whatever y’all do
to this Lefrak cat...

43:18.430 --> 43:21.558
SHAWNA:
Dang. He fine even when he mad.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.813
...I want in.

43:26.896 --> 43:28.857
Uh, yeah.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.442
Yeah, o-okay.

43:30.525 --> 43:31.818
I’ll call you.

43:45.415 --> 43:47.667
SHAWNA: Lefrak’s mansion
in the Quarter-- check.

43:47.751 --> 43:50.670
Lefrak’s red Escalade
parked out front-- check.

43:50.754 --> 43:54.174
Me getting inside and putting
a stake through his heart--

43:54.257 --> 43:56.593
to be determined.

43:58.887 --> 44:00.597
Why are you staring at me, punk?

44:06.144 --> 44:08.313
What?

44:11.858 --> 44:13.943
You know, I researched
this house some.

44:14.027 --> 44:16.029
Anything that can help us
get to Lefrak?

44:16.112 --> 44:18.156
No, but some pretty cool
history stuff.

44:18.239 --> 44:20.450
-About?
-What have I told you is

44:20.533 --> 44:23.453
the alpha and omega of
this here New Orleans history?

44:23.536 --> 44:24.871
Slavery?

44:24.954 --> 44:26.790
The man who built this house,

44:26.873 --> 44:29.084
one of the most notorious
slave owners in Louisiana.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.795
Little bitch owned
400 slaves at his peak.

44:31.878 --> 44:33.671
-Ugh.
-Savage.

44:33.755 --> 44:35.298
He must have really loved it.

44:35.382 --> 44:36.800
Held on to the bitter end.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.885
Built an underground
tunnel system to hide

44:38.968 --> 44:40.095
his slaves from Union soldiers.

44:40.178 --> 44:42.055
Yeah, history. Cool.

44:42.138 --> 44:43.515
Okay, can we focus on the now?

44:44.641 --> 44:46.393
All right, well,
it’s getting late.

44:46.476 --> 44:48.395
-The sun is gonna go down.
-Uh-uh. We’re never gonna

44:48.478 --> 44:50.397
see nothing if we leave
every day before dark.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.065
They’re vampires. Duh.

44:52.148 --> 44:53.566
Mami, you know
what could happen.

44:53.650 --> 44:55.860
Stop acting
like such a girl, ’Dro.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.737
Okay, fine. If you want
to stay, that’s fine,

44:57.821 --> 45:00.448
but don’t expect me to put
my fine Mexican ass on the line

45:00.532 --> 45:02.617
’cause you want to act
all stupid.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.370
-I’m leaving, for real.
-Okay.

45:06.996 --> 45:09.624
And don’t even try to stop me.

45:09.707 --> 45:10.875
Bye.

45:23.096 --> 45:25.306
I can’t believe
we’re doing this.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.728
That’s the third pair
to come out of there tonight.

45:35.733 --> 45:38.278
Vampires like hos.

45:38.361 --> 45:40.029
So what?

45:40.113 --> 45:42.449
SHAWNA: I had a plan,
but I needed another girl.

45:42.532 --> 45:45.785
I knew just the person
crazy enough to do it with me.

45:45.869 --> 45:49.789
In fact, she went straight
SAT prep mode on my ass.

45:49.873 --> 45:52.375
GRANYA:
So, this one says it’s possible

45:52.459 --> 45:53.835
for some vampires to use

45:53.918 --> 45:56.754
psychic mind control attacks
on their victims.

45:56.838 --> 45:58.673
So...

45:58.756 --> 46:02.802
So, doesn’t that explain why
the ladies of the night...

46:02.886 --> 46:05.263
-Ladies of the night?
-The prostitutes.

46:05.346 --> 46:07.474
Oh, the hos. Right.

46:07.557 --> 46:10.602
Lefrak probably used
some kind of mind control

46:10.685 --> 46:12.979
to make them forget
about the feeding.

46:13.062 --> 46:14.522
Makes sense.

46:14.606 --> 46:17.192
Okay, but if he uses that on me,
I’m a goner, right?

46:17.275 --> 46:18.443
Not exactly.

46:18.526 --> 46:20.361
I read up
on psychological attacks,

46:20.445 --> 46:22.155
and I came across
this military study

46:22.238 --> 46:23.364
from, like, World War II.

46:23.448 --> 46:26.242
Okay. And?

46:26.326 --> 46:28.244
If Lefrak tries
to hypnotize you or whatever,

46:28.328 --> 46:30.413
just, you know, remember
something from your past

46:30.497 --> 46:32.665
to keep you in the real world
and out of dreamland.

46:32.749 --> 46:34.751
So I just need to think
of a memory?

46:34.834 --> 46:37.170
-That’s it?
-That’s it.

46:37.253 --> 46:40.340
Hey, do you think
I’ll meet a cute one?

46:40.423 --> 46:42.926
I cannot believe I’m doing this.

46:43.009 --> 46:44.886
I can’t believe
I’m on this side of town,

46:44.969 --> 46:46.638
in this store, doing this.

46:46.721 --> 46:49.307
I take it this ain’t
your typical afternoon activity.

46:49.390 --> 46:50.767
Uh, no.

46:50.850 --> 46:52.810
My parents keep my itinerary
pretty full.

46:52.894 --> 46:54.145
With what?

46:54.229 --> 46:56.689
With diving, chess, debate team,

46:56.773 --> 46:58.525
Model UN, drama.

46:58.608 --> 47:00.944
Oh, and Mandarin and French.

47:01.027 --> 47:03.655
And like a thousand other things
I’m probably forgetting.

47:09.452 --> 47:11.204
SHAWNA:
We’re gonna need some makeup.

47:19.087 --> 47:21.256
So, while me and Granya
worked on our entrance plan...

47:21.339 --> 47:24.884
We got pizza,
extra garlic powder.

47:24.968 --> 47:27.762
SHAWNA: ...Chris and Pedro
worked on our exit plan.

47:29.681 --> 47:33.393
And I worked on
the plan of attack-- alone.

47:33.476 --> 47:35.061
Even with help,
it was pretty nuts

47:35.144 --> 47:36.563
to think I could pull this off.

47:36.646 --> 47:38.064
I’m not Buffy.

47:38.147 --> 47:41.693
I’m just--
I don’t know-- Shawna.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.903
But I wasn’t about
to give up now.

47:46.072 --> 47:49.325
Night before, couldn’t sleep.

47:51.786 --> 47:54.080
Day of, couldn’t eat.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.542
STEVEN:
All right, headed out.

48:06.175 --> 48:08.928
-Where are you going?
- Oh.

48:10.138 --> 48:11.556
What are you doing?

48:11.639 --> 48:13.933
What does it look like?

48:14.017 --> 48:15.560
It look like you giving up.

48:15.643 --> 48:17.979
Dead is dead, Shawna.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.359
Don’t stay out too late.

48:31.284 --> 48:33.036
Okay, are we good
with the getaway plan?

48:33.119 --> 48:34.579
-Yeah.
-Let’s do it, then.

48:34.662 --> 48:36.748
Wait. I actually need
someone to help me

48:36.831 --> 48:38.291
tape the stake to my leg.

48:38.374 --> 48:41.252
Um, okay. Can you hold it?

48:44.255 --> 48:45.715
Thanks.

48:45.798 --> 48:47.634
Why doesn’t mine look like that?

48:47.717 --> 48:49.719
Fashion 101, mami:
big risk, bigger reward.

48:49.802 --> 48:51.596
I couldn’t figure out
where to hide it

48:51.679 --> 48:53.681
’cause there’s not much room
for a stake, but...

48:53.765 --> 48:55.058
I was thinking maybe my leg...

48:55.141 --> 48:57.685
I’ll do it. Okay.

49:14.577 --> 49:16.537
Too tight?

49:16.621 --> 49:18.831
Perfect.

49:24.128 --> 49:26.714
-Hey, I have a question.
-

49:26.798 --> 49:28.716
I know why Pedro’s helping me.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.134
He’s my best friend.

49:30.218 --> 49:32.220
And Granya, well, she’s, like,

49:32.303 --> 49:34.555
obsessed with vampires,
so it’s a no-brainer, but...

49:34.639 --> 49:36.766
you I don’t really get.

49:36.849 --> 49:38.685
I mean, I’m-I’m happy
that you’re doing it.

49:38.768 --> 49:40.812
Just, um...

49:40.895 --> 49:41.896
why?

49:44.357 --> 49:46.275
Let’s just go kill
some vampires.

49:47.652 --> 49:49.278
Okay.

50:00.748 --> 50:02.792
SHAWNA:
This was it.

50:06.045 --> 50:09.340
I didn’t have time to
figure out why I had a stalker.

50:11.050 --> 50:13.636
Revenge was just
a few steps away.

50:36.117 --> 50:37.744
-GRANYA: Wait.

50:37.827 --> 50:39.245
I don’t want to do this.

50:39.328 --> 50:40.705
-This is a horrible idea.
-No, it’s too late.

50:40.788 --> 50:41.998
-MAN: Yeah?
-

50:43.750 --> 50:46.210
I get it.
You looking for Lefrak.

50:46.294 --> 50:48.629
You got your days mixed up.
Come back Thursday.

50:48.713 --> 50:51.549
Uh, we were told
to come tonight.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.472
You know what?

50:57.555 --> 51:00.016
I thought y’all had money,
and we were really ready

51:00.099 --> 51:02.852
to get down tonight,
so just forget it.

51:02.935 --> 51:04.479
We don’t have time for no games.

51:04.562 --> 51:06.189
-MAN: Hold up.

51:08.900 --> 51:11.652
Y’all are too young...

51:11.736 --> 51:15.364
and too delicious
to let walk away.

51:17.408 --> 51:19.285
Y’all go chill inside.

51:19.368 --> 51:21.621
I’ll see if Lefrak’s ready.

51:22.663 --> 51:24.791
Mmm.

51:40.848 --> 51:43.059
-

51:52.777 --> 51:55.071
OLD MAN:
I was once on the bottom, too.

51:55.154 --> 51:57.573
But now we all have new life.

51:57.657 --> 51:58.908
We’ve been reborn.

52:00.576 --> 52:02.328
This time on top.

52:02.411 --> 52:05.957
Those days of us
being pushed aside,

52:06.040 --> 52:09.377
forgotten and abused--
well, those days are gone

52:09.460 --> 52:11.462
so long as you’re willing
to fight.

52:11.546 --> 52:13.589
-Fight back!
-

52:13.673 --> 52:15.216
We must...

52:19.136 --> 52:22.598
Just make sure that
you take them all with you.

52:22.682 --> 52:23.891
Be hungry.

52:23.975 --> 52:25.685
-Are you with me?
-OTHERS: Yeah!

52:27.186 --> 52:31.440
All right.
Who wants to go first?

52:33.818 --> 52:36.153
Come on, then.

52:36.237 --> 52:38.322
Lefrak is ready for you.

53:14.525 --> 53:18.613
-I usually don’t like my girls
as dark as you. -

53:20.740 --> 53:22.450
Sorry.

53:22.533 --> 53:23.951
What you lack in beauty

53:24.035 --> 53:26.287
you more than make up for
in youth.

53:26.370 --> 53:29.040
And I like ’em young.

53:52.355 --> 53:54.190
No silver.

54:21.050 --> 54:23.177
SHAWNA:
Cold leather.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.400
Yo. They’re in.

54:37.483 --> 54:39.402
-Got the garlic powder?
-Yeah.

54:39.485 --> 54:42.238
All right, let’s get this pumped
through the windows.

54:43.948 --> 54:44.991
Ready?

55:05.970 --> 55:07.805
Don’t be scared.

55:14.854 --> 55:17.023
-I ain’t.
-Mm.

55:26.532 --> 55:28.534
I...

55:28.617 --> 55:30.870
I need to use the bathroom.

55:49.513 --> 55:51.724
LEFRAK:
Hurry up in there.

56:05.988 --> 56:07.615
Don’t we need a rubber?

56:07.698 --> 56:10.534
Not for what I’m about to do.

56:29.303 --> 56:31.263
Look deep into my eyes.

56:33.474 --> 56:34.767
SHAWNA:
Mind control.

56:34.850 --> 56:36.352
Relax.

56:36.435 --> 56:38.395
SHAWNA:
I needed a memory.

56:38.479 --> 56:40.731
I needed a memory quick.

56:58.374 --> 57:01.127
You won’t remember me.

57:01.210 --> 57:03.587
You won’t remember.

57:03.671 --> 57:06.298
Do you know where you are?

57:07.633 --> 57:09.552
I can’t remember.

57:37.413 --> 57:39.748
What is going on here?

58:09.862 --> 58:12.198
OLD MAN:
Get Lefrak!

58:21.707 --> 58:24.293
-

58:25.169 --> 58:26.503
Come on.

58:27.546 --> 58:29.798
She did it. Come on.

58:45.231 --> 58:47.024
Who are you?

58:48.234 --> 58:50.569
I’m Denise’s daughter.

58:50.653 --> 58:52.488
Who is Den...

58:55.491 --> 58:57.576
-She good?
-You okay?

58:57.660 --> 58:59.370
-Oh, no.

58:59.453 --> 59:00.537
Get back!

59:02.289 --> 59:04.458
Go. Go. I got it.

59:17.137 --> 59:18.973
-CHRIS: You all right?
-SHAWNA: Yeah, I guess.

59:19.056 --> 59:20.391
CHRIS:
Let’s bounce.

59:22.017 --> 59:24.311
Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go.

59:33.237 --> 59:35.489
Four children
are leaving the house.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.619
Bring them to me.

59:40.703 --> 59:42.371
Dead, alive-- I don’t care!

59:42.454 --> 59:43.998
It doesn’t matter!

59:59.555 --> 1:00:02.057
Yo, Chris. What you doing here?

1:00:02.141 --> 1:00:03.600
I’m with Shawna.

1:00:08.355 --> 1:00:10.357
You guys sure you don’t
want to take a shower?

1:00:10.441 --> 1:00:11.984
We have plenty of clean towels.

1:00:12.067 --> 1:00:13.861
Shawna, did you know
that Pedro got into

1:00:13.944 --> 1:00:15.988
McAdams Academy in Texas
and he’s not gonna go?

1:00:16.071 --> 1:00:18.532
-Mm-hmm. -That’s, like, one of
the top schools in the country.

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:20.159
I would’ve killed to go there.

1:00:20.242 --> 1:00:22.077
Look, I belong in New Orleans
and nowhere else, okay?

1:00:22.161 --> 1:00:23.954
It ain’t that deep.
He just scared of white people.

1:00:24.038 --> 1:00:26.874
Fair enough. White people are
sort of terrifying. I get it.

1:00:26.957 --> 1:00:28.334
I’m not scared.

1:00:28.417 --> 1:00:29.960
Let’s just stay focused
on vampire stuff.

1:00:30.044 --> 1:00:32.921
CHRIS: Well, I guess we know,
if you kill the leader,

1:00:33.005 --> 1:00:35.049
shit stays the same.

1:00:35.132 --> 1:00:36.884
Except maybe we didn’t
kill the leader.

1:00:36.967 --> 1:00:38.927
Let me see those pictures.

1:00:43.682 --> 1:00:45.059
There he is.

1:00:45.142 --> 1:00:46.769
That’s the street preacher
from the Ombreux.

1:00:46.852 --> 1:00:49.229
Yeah. He’s operating
out of the same house

1:00:49.313 --> 1:00:50.647
he was a slave in.

1:00:50.731 --> 1:00:52.608
That’s sort of poetic.

1:00:52.691 --> 1:00:54.151
Okay, so this little bitch is

1:00:54.234 --> 1:00:55.652
a crazy street preacher
and an ex-slave vampire.

1:00:55.736 --> 1:00:57.112
That doesn’t mean
he’s the leader, though.

1:00:57.196 --> 1:00:59.615
No, but the way
he was talking in there.

1:00:59.698 --> 1:01:01.617
His whole-- I don’t know-- vibe.

1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:04.453
-I think he was in charge.
-CHRIS: Could be.

1:01:04.536 --> 1:01:06.246
Okay, b-but we took
our only shot, mami.

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:07.873
Not like we can
go back there now.

1:01:11.460 --> 1:01:13.170
Damn, Shawna,
what’s your problem?

1:01:13.253 --> 1:01:14.922
-Okay.
-

1:01:15.005 --> 1:01:16.715
Okay, wh-what...
what should we do?

1:01:16.799 --> 1:01:18.592
-Calm down.

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:20.844
If it’s them, they can’t come in
unless we invite them.

1:01:20.928 --> 1:01:22.221
-"Them"?
-We should go.

1:01:22.304 --> 1:01:24.098
-Go where?
-

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:25.349
Go away!

1:01:25.432 --> 1:01:27.393
-It’s okay. They can’t come in.
-

1:01:27.476 --> 1:01:29.061
Should we jump out the window?

1:01:29.144 --> 1:01:31.772
Out the window? What the fuck
is wrong with y’all?

1:01:31.855 --> 1:01:33.774
-Y’all smoking or something?
-Are you guys even listening?

1:01:33.857 --> 1:01:35.067
There are rules.

1:01:35.150 --> 1:01:36.652
-They can’t come in.
-We got stakes.

1:01:36.735 --> 1:01:37.945
-Stakes? What...
-

1:01:38.028 --> 1:01:39.029
I said go away!

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:51.834
-Go! -Oh, shit!

1:01:51.917 --> 1:01:53.293
-CHRIS: Jamal!
-Oh, shit!

1:01:55.421 --> 1:01:56.588
Jamal!

1:02:03.804 --> 1:02:05.222
GRANYA:
This can’t happen!

1:02:17.818 --> 1:02:19.486
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1:02:57.065 --> 1:02:58.734
-

1:03:14.625 --> 1:03:16.502
-

1:03:31.808 --> 1:03:34.353
-

1:03:34.436 --> 1:03:37.022
CHRIS: Yo, Granya, I thought
you said they couldn’t come in.

1:03:37.105 --> 1:03:38.899
GRANYA:
Sorry.

1:03:47.699 --> 1:03:49.576
Say, bruh, one of y’all
better tell me

1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:51.870
what the fuck is going on.

1:03:54.331 --> 1:03:55.707
SHAWNA:
Turns out my cabbie stalker

1:03:55.791 --> 1:03:58.627
goes by the name of Tunde.

1:03:58.710 --> 1:04:00.546
At 800 years old, he was

1:04:00.629 --> 1:04:03.215
one of the oldest vampires
in the world.

1:04:03.298 --> 1:04:05.509
Tunde told us
there are several covens

1:04:05.592 --> 1:04:08.178
and he’d been at war with the
street preacher named Babineaux

1:04:08.262 --> 1:04:10.556
for over a century.

1:04:13.141 --> 1:04:16.895
Tunde told us that Babineaux
was once a slave in the city.

1:04:16.979 --> 1:04:18.397
-

1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:21.024
That he’s seen
the worst in humanity.

1:04:21.108 --> 1:04:22.734
-

1:04:22.818 --> 1:04:26.280
One night, he was attacked
by a vampire...

1:04:26.363 --> 1:04:28.615
-

1:04:29.950 --> 1:04:32.077
...and turned.

1:04:33.537 --> 1:04:35.914
Babineaux took power
into his own hands

1:04:35.998 --> 1:04:38.166
and killed his master.

1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:44.214
And from the ashes
rose a new power.

1:04:46.967 --> 1:04:49.511
After Katrina, he became worse.

1:04:49.595 --> 1:04:51.847
And as the gap between
the haves and have-nots

1:04:51.930 --> 1:04:54.266
-continues to grow...
-

1:04:54.349 --> 1:04:56.310
he believes
it’s time for action.

1:04:58.020 --> 1:05:01.106
He’s been building an army
right under humans’ noses,

1:05:01.189 --> 1:05:04.610
seeking the down-and-out
and turning them into soldiers,

1:05:04.693 --> 1:05:07.529
as he thinks
they will not be missed.

1:05:09.197 --> 1:05:12.534
Babineaux is
a vampire supremacist,

1:05:12.618 --> 1:05:15.245
one of the last coven leaders
to think this way.

1:05:15.329 --> 1:05:17.789
He looks at humans
the way a lion does a gazelle.

1:05:19.499 --> 1:05:21.501
Just prey.

1:05:25.672 --> 1:05:28.759
Um, if you a vampire,
how come you ain’t eat us?

1:05:28.842 --> 1:05:31.011
With modern-day technology,

1:05:31.094 --> 1:05:33.680
it is archaic to eat humans.

1:05:33.764 --> 1:05:35.515
So, why were you watching me?

1:05:35.599 --> 1:05:37.976
I was there to observe
Babineaux.

1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:41.521
You were just
a curious variable.

1:05:41.605 --> 1:05:42.898
And the sun?

1:05:42.981 --> 1:05:45.025
TUNDE: The sun is
a nuisance to new vampires.

1:05:45.108 --> 1:05:49.029
It hasn’t affected me
in about 500 or 600 years.

1:05:49.112 --> 1:05:53.075
Survival in the daylight
is possible with time...

1:05:53.158 --> 1:05:55.494
and melanin.

1:05:55.577 --> 1:05:57.871
Only vampires
with an ample supply

1:05:57.954 --> 1:06:00.916
can endure the light.

1:06:00.999 --> 1:06:03.627
It’s like a superpower.

1:06:03.710 --> 1:06:06.380
Then you’d make
a good vampire, then, Wesley.

1:06:06.463 --> 1:06:07.589
Why do you call her that?

1:06:07.673 --> 1:06:09.549
’Cause she mad black
like Wesley Snipes.

1:06:13.387 --> 1:06:15.138
When I was a boy,

1:06:15.222 --> 1:06:19.184
long before I was like this,

1:06:19.267 --> 1:06:21.395
in my village,

1:06:21.478 --> 1:06:25.357
there was what
you might call a princess--

1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:27.234
the chief’s daughter.

1:06:27.317 --> 1:06:30.987
Her skin was as dark
as the nighttime ocean.

1:06:31.071 --> 1:06:34.783
All of the other girls
were envious

1:06:34.866 --> 1:06:37.452
and spent hours in the sun

1:06:37.536 --> 1:06:40.789
trying to look just like her.

1:06:40.872 --> 1:06:45.335
She was the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen.

1:06:46.545 --> 1:06:48.630
You are not unlike her.

1:06:48.714 --> 1:06:52.342
Your brother
or anyone in your presence

1:06:52.426 --> 1:06:54.970
should consider themselves
very lucky.

1:06:57.389 --> 1:06:59.558
I agree with Tunde.

1:06:59.641 --> 1:07:02.102
You’re beautiful.

1:07:02.185 --> 1:07:04.146
PEDRO:
Yeah. Me, too.

1:07:04.229 --> 1:07:07.190
It’s your sister, dude.

1:07:11.737 --> 1:07:13.488
I missed the fight!

1:07:13.572 --> 1:07:15.031
TUNDE:
Yakubu...

1:07:15.115 --> 1:07:18.034
while I’m away,
watch over these children.

1:07:18.118 --> 1:07:19.703
Watch us? Where you going?

1:07:19.786 --> 1:07:22.205
I’m going to put an end
to Babineaux’s antics.

1:07:22.289 --> 1:07:24.499
Okay, if you’re getting
Babineaux, I want to go.

1:07:24.583 --> 1:07:29.045
Shawna, what you did
with Lefrak was very brave.

1:07:29.129 --> 1:07:31.006
But it was also
incredibly foolish.

1:07:31.089 --> 1:07:34.301
You have disturbed
an uneasy peace.

1:07:34.384 --> 1:07:35.594
Stay with Yakubu.

1:07:35.677 --> 1:07:37.387
He’s strong and trustworthy.

1:07:37.471 --> 1:07:39.097
He will keep you safe
until the morning.

1:07:39.181 --> 1:07:40.432
You can’t cut me out of this.

1:07:40.515 --> 1:07:43.143
You are no longer part of this.

1:07:52.027 --> 1:07:53.403
Mm-mm.

1:07:56.114 --> 1:07:58.658
I brought you two forks
so you could share.

1:07:58.742 --> 1:08:00.827
CHRIS:
What is that?

1:08:00.911 --> 1:08:02.621
I don’t know. Dad made it.

1:08:02.704 --> 1:08:04.664
Yeah, I think maybe
I’ll take that shower after all.

1:08:10.921 --> 1:08:13.089
I think I’m good.

1:08:18.595 --> 1:08:20.514
My brother.

1:08:20.597 --> 1:08:21.932
Huh?

1:08:22.015 --> 1:08:25.602
Earlier, you asked me
why I wanted to help you.

1:08:25.685 --> 1:08:27.938
My brother.

1:08:28.021 --> 1:08:30.857
He’s on that stuff,
just like your moms was.

1:08:32.734 --> 1:08:34.486
Oh.

1:08:35.737 --> 1:08:38.824
Wait, so I did see you
over at the Ombreux.

1:08:39.866 --> 1:08:41.368
It’s embarrassing.

1:08:41.451 --> 1:08:44.496
Is your brother, um...

1:08:44.579 --> 1:08:46.331
I mean, did he get
turned into a...

1:08:46.414 --> 1:08:48.291
A vampire? Nah.

1:08:48.375 --> 1:08:49.960
He came home last week.

1:08:50.043 --> 1:08:51.795
Not sure it really matters,
though.

1:08:51.878 --> 1:08:52.879
What you mean?

1:08:52.963 --> 1:08:55.090
I don’t know who to be mad at:

1:08:55.173 --> 1:08:57.050
Kelvin...

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:59.761
dealers, crooked-ass cops,
my folks.

1:08:59.845 --> 1:09:01.680
But you,

1:09:01.763 --> 1:09:04.099
you got somebody
to take it out on.

1:09:06.226 --> 1:09:08.103
I guess I...

1:09:08.186 --> 1:09:10.355
sort of wanted in on that.

1:09:11.857 --> 1:09:13.400
Guess it makes me
sort of selfish...

1:09:13.483 --> 1:09:16.444
No, it don’t.

1:09:16.528 --> 1:09:18.947
I understand.

1:09:19.030 --> 1:09:21.241
I thought you might.

1:09:28.582 --> 1:09:30.458
I meant what I said earlier.

1:09:33.420 --> 1:09:35.839
You’re beautiful.

1:09:40.510 --> 1:09:42.095
I am, aren’t I?

1:09:44.264 --> 1:09:45.640
Yo, and humble, too.

1:09:45.724 --> 1:09:47.893
¡Ay, Dios!

1:09:51.354 --> 1:09:54.065
-Oh...

1:09:55.734 --> 1:09:57.694
He’ll be all right.

1:10:04.701 --> 1:10:06.703
-

1:10:07.871 --> 1:10:10.498
Babineaux is not here.

1:10:16.379 --> 1:10:17.547
-

1:10:17.631 --> 1:10:19.132
It’s been too long.

1:10:19.215 --> 1:10:21.509
-Yeah.
-We’ve been waiting.

1:10:21.593 --> 1:10:23.219
That was Tunde.

1:10:23.303 --> 1:10:24.763
Did they get Babineaux?

1:10:24.846 --> 1:10:26.097
The coward is hiding somewhere.

1:10:26.181 --> 1:10:27.557
So, what are we supposed to do?

1:10:27.641 --> 1:10:28.850
Wait until they find him.

1:10:28.934 --> 1:10:31.061
It’s shaping up
to be a long night.

1:10:35.941 --> 1:10:38.234
CHRIS:
So, where did Babineaux go?

1:10:38.318 --> 1:10:39.945
He couldn’t have gone far,
right?

1:10:42.656 --> 1:10:45.241
The tunnels-- under the mansion.

1:10:45.325 --> 1:10:46.701
If they were built
to hide slaves,

1:10:46.785 --> 1:10:48.286
Babineaux would know about them.

1:10:48.370 --> 1:10:49.621
-We should tell Tunde.
-CHRIS: We should go.

1:10:49.704 --> 1:10:51.581
What? Chris.

1:10:51.665 --> 1:10:53.875
I have extra stakes
under my bed.

1:10:53.959 --> 1:10:55.835
Shawna.

1:10:55.919 --> 1:10:58.004
Listen, ’Dro, if you don’t
want to go, it’s cool.

1:10:58.088 --> 1:10:59.547
You’ve done enough already.

1:10:59.631 --> 1:11:01.633
Shawna, you know
I’ve supported you

1:11:01.716 --> 1:11:04.719
in every crazy thing you wanted
to do since your mom passed.

1:11:04.803 --> 1:11:08.640
Trust me when I say this is
the worst idea of them all.

1:11:14.145 --> 1:11:15.563
Give me a stake.

1:11:36.835 --> 1:11:39.254
I’m going to that
boarding school in Texas.

1:11:39.337 --> 1:11:42.215
I mean, if we make it
out of this shit alive,

1:11:42.298 --> 1:11:44.509
-then yeah, I’m going.
-

1:11:44.592 --> 1:11:45.885
I just... I figured,

1:11:45.969 --> 1:11:47.721
if you can fight vampires
over the summer,

1:11:47.804 --> 1:11:51.641
then I can deal with a bunch of
white folks for a couple years.

1:11:53.143 --> 1:11:55.812
And I-I deserve it.

1:11:55.895 --> 1:11:58.398
Family will be fine.

1:11:59.774 --> 1:12:01.609
You’ll be fine.

1:12:01.693 --> 1:12:05.739
But if I don’t go, I won’t be.

1:12:05.822 --> 1:12:08.366
Don’t worry,
I’ll come back and visit

1:12:08.450 --> 1:12:10.618
-your trifling ass
for Carnival. -Oh, shut up.

1:12:18.668 --> 1:12:20.003
What y’all doing?

1:12:20.086 --> 1:12:21.755
We’re gonna go get Babineaux.

1:12:21.838 --> 1:12:23.339
For Mom.

1:12:46.154 --> 1:12:47.864
Hey, Yakubu?

1:12:47.947 --> 1:12:48.990
What is it?

1:12:49.074 --> 1:12:51.201
-JAMAL: Go!

1:12:51.284 --> 1:12:52.577
Go, go, go!

1:12:57.290 --> 1:12:59.084
We got to hurry.

1:13:07.258 --> 1:13:09.677
-I don’t think I’m going.
-What?

1:13:09.761 --> 1:13:11.012
Why not?

1:13:11.096 --> 1:13:13.264
Vampires aren’t
so much fun in real life.

1:13:13.348 --> 1:13:15.558
Yeah, I guess they ain’t.

1:13:15.642 --> 1:13:18.353
SAT prep sounds pretty good
right about now.

1:13:22.398 --> 1:13:24.567
SHAWNA:
Thanks.

1:13:24.651 --> 1:13:25.902
For everything.

1:13:25.985 --> 1:13:27.529
Okay.

1:13:27.612 --> 1:13:28.947
GRANYA:
Good luck.

1:13:29.030 --> 1:13:31.282
Go kick some vampire butt
for me.

1:13:38.832 --> 1:13:41.000
-Yo. Get down.

1:13:58.268 --> 1:14:00.270
The tunnels.

1:15:17.305 --> 1:15:19.015
-

1:16:53.735 --> 1:16:56.529
-

1:16:57.780 --> 1:16:58.948
You missed!

1:17:01.784 --> 1:17:04.287
-No. No, no, no.

1:17:04.370 --> 1:17:05.913
-No. Shawna, Shawna!
-BABINEAUX: Feast.

1:17:05.997 --> 1:17:09.417
Shawna, help me! Help me!

1:17:17.216 --> 1:17:19.177
SHAWNA:
No, Pedro!

1:17:19.260 --> 1:17:21.888
-Pedro, no.
-

1:17:24.223 --> 1:17:25.767
Pedro.

1:17:28.061 --> 1:17:29.479
Chris.

1:17:29.562 --> 1:17:31.689
Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.

1:17:31.773 --> 1:17:34.442
-

1:17:57.465 --> 1:17:59.133
I only want to talk.

1:18:01.594 --> 1:18:07.934
Only a loss could make you
this determined, this angry.

1:18:08.726 --> 1:18:10.895
Who did you lose?

1:18:20.071 --> 1:18:21.489
My mother.

1:18:23.533 --> 1:18:25.326
You stole her from me.

1:18:25.410 --> 1:18:27.954
I gave your mother power!

1:18:29.288 --> 1:18:31.582
I gave her a shot
at immortality.

1:18:31.666 --> 1:18:34.085
-It was a gift.
-A gift?

1:18:34.168 --> 1:18:35.545
She’s dead.

1:18:35.628 --> 1:18:39.590
Well, every great struggle
has its martyrs.

1:18:39.674 --> 1:18:41.426
What?

1:18:41.509 --> 1:18:44.595
They put us down,
they-they kick us,

1:18:44.679 --> 1:18:47.765
and then they wonder why we
haven’t gotten up on our own.

1:18:47.849 --> 1:18:50.351
I’ve watched it for centuries.

1:18:50.435 --> 1:18:52.353
I saw it when we were in chains.

1:18:52.437 --> 1:18:55.356
I saw it when we were
in the back of the bus.

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:58.359
I see it now as they push us
from our homes.

1:18:58.443 --> 1:19:00.194
But why? I mean, why now?

1:19:00.278 --> 1:19:02.321
This is the beginning
of the end for us in this city.

1:19:02.405 --> 1:19:04.365
The Ombreux was the last straw.

1:19:04.449 --> 1:19:07.285
-What? -When Katrina
didn’t swallow us up,

1:19:07.368 --> 1:19:09.871
well, they... then they turned
to development.

1:19:09.954 --> 1:19:12.748
Soon, there won’t be enough
of us left to band together.

1:19:12.832 --> 1:19:14.375
Band together?

1:19:14.459 --> 1:19:16.252
I mean,
you’re-you’re a murderer.

1:19:16.335 --> 1:19:19.255
All the protests we’ve had,
all the marches we’ve done.

1:19:19.338 --> 1:19:20.965
People want to make
a difference.

1:19:21.048 --> 1:19:22.842
You could’ve just convinced us
to just fight with you.

1:19:22.925 --> 1:19:25.761
The marches,
the protests, the riots.

1:19:25.845 --> 1:19:28.389
Slave revolts. I’ve seen it all.

1:19:28.473 --> 1:19:33.561
1859, 1968, 1992, 2020.

1:19:33.644 --> 1:19:37.148
All bright flames
that suddenly got snuffed out.

1:19:37.231 --> 1:19:39.567
But when you’re immortal,

1:19:39.650 --> 1:19:43.446
you get to watch
the whole big picture.

1:19:43.529 --> 1:19:46.073
You learn how to stoke
the flames,

1:19:46.157 --> 1:19:47.825
to keep it burning.

1:19:49.827 --> 1:19:51.579
That’s what I’m doing.

1:19:51.662 --> 1:19:52.955
You’re sick.

1:19:53.039 --> 1:19:54.540
You should just give up now

1:19:54.624 --> 1:19:56.292
’cause Tunde’s already
destroyed your army.

1:19:56.375 --> 1:19:58.503
I’ll just have to build
another one, won’t I?

1:19:58.586 --> 1:20:00.963
I mean, this is New Orleans.

1:20:01.047 --> 1:20:04.383
There’s never gonna be
a shortage of the down-and-out.

1:20:05.176 --> 1:20:08.513
I have nothing but time.

1:20:08.596 --> 1:20:11.098
You... No.

1:20:11.182 --> 1:20:13.142
You could join me.

1:20:15.061 --> 1:20:19.815
You could... you could
actually lead by my side.

1:20:19.899 --> 1:20:23.861
Someone with your ability,

1:20:23.945 --> 1:20:25.738
with your determination--

1:20:25.821 --> 1:20:28.658
you’d be a powerful vampire.

1:20:28.741 --> 1:20:31.994
Your skin.

1:20:32.078 --> 1:20:35.164
You’d be day-walking
by tomorrow.

1:20:35.248 --> 1:20:36.624
You...

1:20:37.875 --> 1:20:39.835
You could help.

1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:43.464
You could actually
right the wrongs

1:20:43.548 --> 1:20:47.635
that gave your mother the
problems she had to deal with.

1:20:50.471 --> 1:20:51.722
I’d rather die.

1:20:54.767 --> 1:20:57.436
-

1:20:59.397 --> 1:21:01.148
-

1:21:20.793 --> 1:21:23.671
It tastes so much sweeter

1:21:23.754 --> 1:21:26.757
when it’s against your will.

1:21:35.975 --> 1:21:37.727
Eat this!

1:21:37.810 --> 1:21:39.478
-

1:22:00.374 --> 1:22:01.959
This is for my mother.

1:22:33.199 --> 1:22:34.617
CHRIS:
Shawna.

1:22:35.785 --> 1:22:37.244
No, no. Pedro, Pedro.

1:22:37.328 --> 1:22:39.413
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro,
it’s gonna be okay.

1:22:39.497 --> 1:22:41.666
Pedro, it’s gonna be okay.
Just c-come on.

1:22:41.749 --> 1:22:43.876
Just stay with us.
Pedro, Pedro, stay with us.

1:22:43.959 --> 1:22:46.837
Pedro, no. No, Pedro, please!

1:22:46.921 --> 1:22:48.547
Please stay with us!

1:22:48.631 --> 1:22:50.675
Pedro, please stay.

1:22:50.758 --> 1:22:52.343
Please stay!

1:22:52.426 --> 1:22:54.762
Pedro, no.

1:22:57.056 --> 1:23:00.685
No. Please!

1:23:33.217 --> 1:23:34.885
SHAWNA: Remember what I said
about my world

1:23:34.969 --> 1:23:36.679
getting messed up beyond belief?

1:23:36.762 --> 1:23:39.473
Yeah, well, that doesn’t even
begin to cover it.

1:23:39.557 --> 1:23:42.560
But Pedro always
used to say to me...

1:23:42.643 --> 1:23:44.478
he’d say,

1:23:44.562 --> 1:23:46.689
"Mami, hell no. I’ll call
the fashion police on you,

1:23:46.772 --> 1:23:49.692
and they gonna give you a
life sentence for that outfit."

1:23:49.775 --> 1:23:51.444
You know what else he said,

1:23:51.527 --> 1:23:53.446
like, when I would get sad
or whatever?

1:23:54.864 --> 1:23:56.365
Nothing.

1:23:56.449 --> 1:23:58.242
He didn’t have
some inspirational quote

1:23:58.325 --> 1:23:59.702
to cheer me up.

1:23:59.785 --> 1:24:02.163
He’d just crack a joke,
and next thing I know,

1:24:02.246 --> 1:24:05.124
we’d be laughing and smiling
and barely remembering

1:24:05.207 --> 1:24:08.669
what we were sad about
in the first place.

1:24:08.753 --> 1:24:10.921
So that’s what I’m gonna do.

1:24:11.005 --> 1:24:12.631
I’m gonna smile.

1:24:16.510 --> 1:24:18.304
So that was the summer

1:24:18.387 --> 1:24:21.557
I got breasts
and fought vampires.

1:24:30.566 --> 1:24:33.944
I lost my mother
and my best friend.

1:24:35.446 --> 1:24:37.156
But I gained some people, too.

1:24:39.700 --> 1:24:42.119
Life at home with Jamal
had never been better.

1:24:42.203 --> 1:24:44.038
You look pretty today, Shawn.

1:24:44.121 --> 1:24:45.414
Just like Ma.

1:24:46.665 --> 1:24:47.917
Thanks.

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.544
Granya and I became
friends for life.

1:24:50.628 --> 1:24:53.881
She even convinced me
to try goat yoga.

1:24:55.090 --> 1:24:56.634
Hey. Would you like
to sign our petition?

1:24:56.717 --> 1:24:58.511
Babineaux was wrong
about a lot of things,

1:24:58.594 --> 1:25:01.138
-but some things are worth
fighting for. -Okay.

1:25:01.222 --> 1:25:02.973
-For my family...
-Hello.

1:25:03.057 --> 1:25:04.767
-...my community... -Would you
like to sign our petition?

1:25:04.850 --> 1:25:06.268
-...for myself.
-Cool. Okay.

1:25:06.352 --> 1:25:09.188
-And of course, there was Chris.
-Sign right there.

1:25:09.271 --> 1:25:10.689
Duh.

1:25:12.358 --> 1:25:14.443
CHRIS:
A’ight, so I handed out

1:25:14.527 --> 1:25:16.070
-a bunch of pamphlets.
-Mm-hmm.

1:25:16.153 --> 1:25:18.364
-I’m gonna head out.
-You leaving?

1:25:18.447 --> 1:25:20.950
I got to bring my brother
to this addiction meeting thing.

1:25:21.033 --> 1:25:22.451
I said I’d be there.

1:25:22.535 --> 1:25:24.954
But you still want
to kick it tonight, right?

1:25:25.037 --> 1:25:27.248
How about...

1:25:27.331 --> 1:25:29.208
you go pick us up a pizza,

1:25:29.291 --> 1:25:31.126
and then we meet
back at my place?

1:25:31.210 --> 1:25:32.461
What about your pops?

1:25:35.548 --> 1:25:37.466
As long as you leave
before morning.

1:25:40.636 --> 1:25:42.555
Oh, Chris...

1:25:42.638 --> 1:25:45.015
extra garlic.

1:25:51.063 --> 1:25:53.899
Jamal? You here?

1:25:55.985 --> 1:25:59.488
Or do I have
the whole place to myself?

1:26:01.407 --> 1:26:04.910
Including the bedroom?

1:26:11.876 --> 1:26:13.919
Chris, did you remember the...

1:26:15.296 --> 1:26:16.589
PEDRO:
Hey, mami.
