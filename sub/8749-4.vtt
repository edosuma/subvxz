00:06.098 --> 00:08.800
This is my house of dolls.

00:08.801 --> 00:11.578
Dolls were originally,

00:11.579 --> 00:13.549
vessels for the dead.

00:13.550 --> 00:15.450
My 9-year-old daughter,
she walked in her room

00:15.451 --> 00:17.225
and saw a little girl
playing in her closet.

00:17.226 --> 00:20.609
She just wants something bad to happen.

00:20.610 --> 00:23.512
Ghosts can't harm you. Only the living can.

00:23.513 --> 00:25.981
I feel like I'm just out of
my league with this one.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.987
The living people can hear
the dead people talking.

00:28.988 --> 00:30.788
No.

00:31.188 --> 00:32.700
I'd like some answers.

00:32.701 --> 00:35.552
You need to leave because it's not safe.

00:35.553 --> 00:36.959
Why isn't it safe?

00:36.960 --> 00:41.340
Because so many people died around here.

00:42.312 --> 00:45.200
My name is Amy Allan.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.361
There's something down there.

00:47.362 --> 00:48.719
I see dead people.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.606
He doesn't want me back there.

00:50.607 --> 00:52.740
I speak to dead people.

00:52.741 --> 00:54.096
She's pissed.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.390
And they speak to me.

00:55.391 --> 00:57.801
She doesn't like the people who live here.

00:57.802 --> 01:00.882
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:00.883 --> 01:02.608
Someone did hang themselves here.

01:02.609 --> 01:04.319
- Where?
- There.

01:04.321 --> 01:06.108
I rely on my partner.

01:06.109 --> 01:09.459
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.156
Did you want to kill him?

01:11.157 --> 01:14.697
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:14.698 --> 01:16.496
She did die in this house.

01:16.497 --> 01:17.749
It's my job to reveal them.

01:17.750 --> 01:20.116
Would you be surprised if there
were bodies in the basement?

01:20.117 --> 01:21.037
No.

01:21.038 --> 01:22.539
But Steve and I never speak...

01:22.540 --> 01:24.474
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.061
Until the very end.

01:26.062 --> 01:27.413
Not good.

01:27.414 --> 01:29.378
Will we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:29.379 --> 01:30.572
Will it get worse?

01:30.573 --> 01:31.781
Or time to get out?

01:31.782 --> 01:34.662
- Oh, yes.
- Whew.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074

02:00.318 --> 02:03.287
Steve will dig into the
history of a location.

02:03.288 --> 02:05.289
He'll talk to the people involved.

02:05.290 --> 02:09.293
He'll gather all the facts so
that later when we come together,

02:09.294 --> 02:15.194
we can see if our research has
drawn any significant conclusions.

02:17.439 --> 02:23.339
I'm down in Cramerton, North Carolina,
which is just outside of Charlotte.

02:24.682 --> 02:28.902
Cramerton used to be the location of
the country's largest cotton mill.

02:28.903 --> 02:32.143
This is classic America.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.928
I got a call from a couple
named Lisa and John.

02:34.929 --> 02:36.421
They have a 9 year old daughter,

02:36.422 --> 02:40.491
who's been seeing apparitions
and hearing noises.

02:40.492 --> 02:42.697
They're obviously concerned.

02:42.698 --> 02:48.598
So Amy and I are down here to see if we
can find out anything to help them out.

03:25.559 --> 03:31.459
Matt will come in and do what we
call a cleaning of the location.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.570
So he'll remove anything like...

03:35.571 --> 03:39.771
Personal family photos, artwork, names.

03:40.529 --> 03:42.869
Any type of leading information,

03:42.870 --> 03:46.396
so that I won't lose my focus
during the investigation.

03:46.397 --> 03:49.697
Whoa. Somebody pushed me.

03:50.596 --> 03:53.162
- My head, man.
- What happened?

03:53.163 --> 03:56.306
I don't know. Maybe somebody got
hit in the back of the head...

03:56.307 --> 03:58.211
Really, really, really...

03:58.212 --> 04:00.612
Really hard.

04:00.779 --> 04:03.159
Like, eh. I got hit!

04:03.160 --> 04:06.700
And I'm on the ground now.

04:21.932 --> 04:24.688
- Steve? Hi.
- Lisa. Hi, how are you?

04:24.689 --> 04:28.589
- Good. Come on in.
- Thank you.

04:34.019 --> 04:37.499
This is my house of dolls.

04:52.743 --> 04:54.766
I have over 2,000 dolls.

04:54.767 --> 04:56.617
- Here, in the house?
- Here, yes.

04:56.618 --> 04:58.331
Yeah, they're... they're everywhere.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.817
Just every place you can find
to fit a doll, there is one.

05:01.818 --> 05:05.294
Yeah, I mostly keep and collect dolls.
My dolls go back to over 100 years old.

05:05.295 --> 05:07.432
I got to be honest with you.
I'm a little creeped out.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.826
- This doesn't bother anybody else?
- Nobody in the house it bothers.

05:10.827 --> 05:13.957
I've had people that we
hire to do work for us,

05:13.958 --> 05:15.773
come in and not want to come in and work.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.975
Yeah, I could see.

05:16.976 --> 05:19.055
If I have five or six dolls,
I could put them away.

05:19.056 --> 05:21.393
I'm not putting away a hundred
so you can work on my house.

05:21.394 --> 05:24.602
We just have to get somebody else that's
not creeped out by eyes looking at him.

05:24.603 --> 05:27.407
Lisa, beside yourself, who
else lives in the house?

05:27.408 --> 05:29.537
- My husband Johnny...
- Okay.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.560
And my 9-year-old daughter Salem and me.

05:32.561 --> 05:34.689
All right, so why don't you
tell me what's going on?

05:34.690 --> 05:38.860
Well, Salem has been coming and telling
us about people sitting on her bed

05:38.861 --> 05:40.944
and talking to her since we moved in.

05:40.945 --> 05:43.353
She would say, the lady
was on my bed last night.

05:43.354 --> 05:45.197
You know, the lady talked to me last night.

05:45.198 --> 05:48.474
And just recently, about a month
ago, she walked in her room

05:48.475 --> 05:53.275
and saw a little girl
playing in her closet.

05:56.691 --> 05:58.977
She said a little girl was
messing in her clothes.

05:58.978 --> 06:00.807
Do you think she's getting
that from you guys,

06:00.808 --> 06:03.061
or is there something that she
just picked up on her own?

06:03.062 --> 06:05.682
She brings home books from
the library on World War II,

06:05.683 --> 06:08.305
and Yellow Fever epidemics.

06:08.306 --> 06:12.173
And she's very interested in war and death.

06:12.174 --> 06:13.642
- Really?
- But I got to really...

06:13.643 --> 06:16.257
Really stop her on some of the
things she's interested in.

06:16.258 --> 06:18.293
Like, no, that's all you can see of this.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.208
It's just kind of weird.

06:20.209 --> 06:22.489
All right.

06:39.648 --> 06:41.439
Yeah.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.360
Okay.

06:44.109 --> 06:47.349
Hmm, that's interesting.

07:00.383 --> 07:02.303
Yeah.

07:02.439 --> 07:04.359
Uh...

07:04.382 --> 07:10.022
Just a lot of dolls, which are creepy.
Dolls are creepy.

07:17.793 --> 07:20.193
My goodness.

07:20.343 --> 07:23.643
Oh, my. My, my goodness.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.356
Dolls were originally...

07:27.357 --> 07:30.106
Vessels for the dead. Like to...

07:30.107 --> 07:35.111
So that the dead could be within the dolls
because the dolls are hollow shells.

07:35.112 --> 07:38.701
Yeah, they were vessels made for the dead.

07:38.702 --> 07:43.130
And the dead are talking
about being trapped.

07:43.131 --> 07:46.071
They want to leave.

08:04.483 --> 08:07.783
Oh, my. My, my goodness.

08:09.149 --> 08:12.773
I have never seen this
many dolls in my life.

08:12.774 --> 08:16.077
In some cultures, dolls
were created as vessels

08:16.078 --> 08:18.917
or resting places for the human soul.

08:18.918 --> 08:24.818
Problem is they can also attract
souls that haven't moved on yet.

08:28.621 --> 08:31.753
This is Salem's room.
This is where she sleeps.

08:31.754 --> 08:34.129
- And she's gonna be home soon?
- Yeah.

08:34.130 --> 08:36.061
- It won't be long, yeah. She'll be home.
- Okay.

08:36.062 --> 08:38.107
I'll be able to talk to
her when she gets here.

08:38.107 --> 08:41.607
And you mentioned something about,
there being somebody by the bed?

08:41.607 --> 08:47.039
Yeah. She has woken up many times and said
that she talked to a lady at her bed.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.339
One time, she said she could
feel the lady's weight

08:49.340 --> 08:54.256
of her arm when she laid
her arm across her legs.

08:54.257 --> 09:00.157
And there's the closet where she saw the
little girl playing in her clothes.

09:03.947 --> 09:06.659
There's, like, a little
dead girl in the closet.

09:06.660 --> 09:08.580
Uh...

09:09.532 --> 09:12.112
And I think...

09:12.586 --> 09:14.176
She just...

09:14.177 --> 09:17.837
Wants something bad to happen.

09:19.457 --> 09:21.748
Why do you say that they want
something bad to happen?

09:21.749 --> 09:24.715
Because the little girl just told me that.

09:24.716 --> 09:25.990
What did she tell you?

09:25.991 --> 09:28.262
Uh, that they want something bad to happen.

09:28.263 --> 09:31.251
What does that mean?

09:31.252 --> 09:34.260
She just is giggling.

09:34.261 --> 09:38.780
Have they tried to make bad things happen?

09:38.781 --> 09:42.081
Well, what did they say?

09:42.451 --> 09:47.491
That she doesn't like the
people who live here.

09:55.931 --> 09:58.406
- Hi, Salem.
- Hi.

09:58.407 --> 10:00.524
I'm finally able to sit down with Salem,

10:00.525 --> 10:02.828
who I'm the most concerned
about in this case.

10:02.829 --> 10:05.176
She's the only one that's
seen any paranormal activity.

10:05.177 --> 10:06.906
So I wanted to dig a
little bit deep to find

10:06.907 --> 10:08.783
out what she's seen and what she's heard.

10:08.784 --> 10:10.597
I was wondering if you
can explain some of the

10:10.598 --> 10:12.667
things that were going on,
if that's okay with you?

10:12.668 --> 10:13.475
Yeah.

10:13.476 --> 10:17.648
Okay, why don't you tell me about what you
experience when you're sleeping at night?

10:17.649 --> 10:20.437
There was this lady that came up on my bed.

10:20.438 --> 10:21.925
I was able to feel the pressure.

10:21.926 --> 10:23.625
And this happened while you were sleeping?

10:23.626 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, I woke up and saw
her, and I talked to her,

10:26.001 --> 10:27.996
but I really can't remember what she said.

10:27.997 --> 10:29.702
You said you felt?

10:29.703 --> 10:34.270
Mm-hmm, she was sitting like right
over here while I was laying down.

10:34.271 --> 10:36.472
- And you weren't frightened?
- No.

10:36.473 --> 10:38.758
- At all?
- I felt kind of calm.

10:38.759 --> 10:41.111
So seeing the apparitions
doesn't scare you.

10:41.112 --> 10:42.912
No.

10:43.079 --> 10:46.107
I just find that a little strange, you
know, that it wouldn't scare you.

10:46.108 --> 10:48.966
When I was younger, it scared
me because I didn't understand,

10:48.967 --> 10:51.650
but when I got to, like,
7, I understood, like,

10:51.651 --> 10:55.759
wait, ghosts can't harm
you, only the living can.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.013
I mean, I'm a retired Detective,

10:58.014 --> 11:00.413
and I've been in a lot of
situations where I get scared.

11:00.414 --> 11:02.947
And I can sit here and say
that that would scare me.

11:02.948 --> 11:03.940
Mm-hmm.

11:03.941 --> 11:07.664
Now you have an interest in World War II?

11:07.665 --> 11:11.334
Yeah. My mom started watching
movies about Anne Frank.

11:11.335 --> 11:12.130
Okay.

11:12.131 --> 11:16.078
And I wasn't there back
then in the 1940 to 1945

11:16.079 --> 11:17.915
and 1944 when it happened.

11:17.916 --> 11:18.749
All right.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.831
And so that's when I got interested in,

11:20.832 --> 11:24.654
and I got some books and
started reading about it.

11:24.655 --> 11:29.107
And I still have an interest in The Civil
War with the Confederate and Union.

11:29.108 --> 11:34.568
I think it's, like, scary
and cool at the same time.

11:38.652 --> 11:41.060
See, this is where voices...

11:41.061 --> 11:45.021
There's a lot of voices in here.

11:45.316 --> 11:48.318
Lots of voices because people
are coming and going here.

11:48.319 --> 11:50.220
Dead people are coming and going here.

11:50.221 --> 11:53.756
And they're walking back and forth,
and they're walking back and forth.

11:53.757 --> 11:56.493
And there's a lot of talking,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

11:56.494 --> 11:59.057
And it's... people can hear it.

11:59.058 --> 12:02.557
People can hear people talking.

12:02.558 --> 12:05.213
The living people can hear
the dead people talking.

12:05.214 --> 12:08.479
And they don't want to hear it.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.415
And so they're like closing it off.

12:11.416 --> 12:13.636
Like, No.

12:19.131 --> 12:20.966
Lisa's concerned with their daughter.

12:20.967 --> 12:22.841
Quite frankly, so am I.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.983
It's time for me to sit
down with her husband John.

12:24.984 --> 12:29.664
And find out what he thinks about all this.

12:37.383 --> 12:40.459
Now, John, I'm curious about Salem.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.665
She's pretty young. She's 9.

12:42.666 --> 12:45.697
Now she's seen quite a few things.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.788
I mean how... do you have
a concern about that?

12:48.789 --> 12:51.137
Oh, yeah, I'm very concerned about that.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.944
That's been going on since
we bought the house.

12:53.945 --> 12:58.349
We need to know is this
something that is good?

12:58.350 --> 13:01.547
Is it evil? Is it... what is it?

13:01.548 --> 13:04.728
I'd like some answers.

13:07.553 --> 13:10.677
And, hm, somebody used to like...

13:10.678 --> 13:13.730
Walks up here, walks up here, right here,

13:13.731 --> 13:15.834
right here and then...

13:15.835 --> 13:20.066
Somebody's standing here,
and they're trying to talk.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.009
Yeah, they're trying to talk.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.525
What are they trying to tell them?

13:25.526 --> 13:27.118
To leave.

13:27.119 --> 13:28.614
- To leave?
- Yeah.

13:28.615 --> 13:29.521
Why?

13:29.522 --> 13:32.979
You need to leave because it's not safe.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.920
Why isn't it safe?

13:36.549 --> 13:41.589
I think because so many
people died around here.

14:13.146 --> 14:15.382
When I walked into the basement,

14:15.383 --> 14:19.085
I was struck with the image
of death and disease.

14:19.086 --> 14:23.759
Bodies were just stacked up all over the
room, all the way up to the ceiling.

14:23.760 --> 14:29.580
And then I saw this evil man
that was torturing this girl.

14:29.816 --> 14:34.268
Oh, I get this, like, kind of like weird...

14:34.269 --> 14:36.849
Like... like...

14:36.970 --> 14:42.190
Like he had the black hat and the
black jacket and the black slacks.

14:42.191 --> 14:43.666
And..

14:43.667 --> 14:47.643
He's doing weird things to this girl.

14:47.644 --> 14:49.829
Not even like... oh, man.

14:49.830 --> 14:53.851
[Bleeps] I'm getting these
weird pains that hurt.

14:53.852 --> 14:59.752
He might be poking her, and it's
over a long period of time.

15:00.127 --> 15:03.396
She felt poking it, poking it, didn't hurt.

15:03.397 --> 15:05.398
I'm like, really? Because it hurts me.

15:05.399 --> 15:06.999
No, mnh-mnh.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.570
It didn't hurt her. It was, like, poked.

15:09.571 --> 15:12.571
Like, poking, poking.

15:20.001 --> 15:22.749
Doing my usual background
investigation on a home.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.704
Nothing really jumps out
at me on this case.

15:24.705 --> 15:27.019
The trail goes cold around 1946.

15:27.020 --> 15:30.824
That's when Cramerton Mills owned
this town as well as this house.

15:30.825 --> 15:33.180
So I've set up a meeting
with a man who literally

15:33.181 --> 15:37.801
wrote the book on the history of Cramerton.

15:44.771 --> 15:48.723
I'm conducting an investigation,
actually, at a home that's in Cramerton,

15:48.724 --> 15:51.939
so I was wondering if you could give me
some background information on the area,

15:51.940 --> 15:53.380
on some of its history.

15:53.381 --> 15:56.423
The area that the house
that you were looking at,

15:56.424 --> 15:59.399
is in what we called old town.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.587
Which was the original part of
town that was built to support,

16:02.588 --> 16:06.593
the families that lived and
worked in the original mill.

16:06.594 --> 16:10.187
I'm trying to figure out if anything
bad happened during that time?

16:10.188 --> 16:14.109
There was an earlier plague
that came through the area...

16:14.110 --> 16:16.690
In 1902, 1903.

16:17.104 --> 16:21.974
I can't tell you for sure how many
people were affected in Cramerton,

16:21.975 --> 16:24.110
but most of them died.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.334
And there would have been no mortuary.

16:26.335 --> 16:30.539
No way to keep that many dead bodies.

16:30.540 --> 16:36.120
So they lived in a segregated
area called a Pest House.

16:38.892 --> 16:42.826
You know, there's people
laying down down here.

16:42.827 --> 16:46.487
And I don't know about that.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.869
I don't know.

16:49.870 --> 16:51.255
I don't know about that.

16:51.256 --> 16:53.476
How many?

16:53.807 --> 16:56.757
People, how many people were down here?

16:56.758 --> 16:58.510
Quite a few, yes.

16:58.511 --> 17:01.177
Quite a few stacked.

17:01.178 --> 17:02.411
Ewe.

17:02.412 --> 17:05.063
Ugh, I don't know what that's about.

17:05.064 --> 17:09.502
Eh, they're like in sacks and, uh, sheets.

17:09.502 --> 17:11.501
And uh...

17:11.502 --> 17:14.272
There's a lot of women.

17:14.273 --> 17:15.829
And, uh...

17:15.829 --> 17:19.770
And there are children, a lot of children.

17:19.771 --> 17:23.310
And... and women, and, um...

17:23.719 --> 17:27.387
And they got sick. They were sick.

17:27.388 --> 17:30.749
And people are like this.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.345
I'm sick, I'm sick.

17:36.604 --> 17:39.185
And they're all, like, cold.

17:39.186 --> 17:41.891
It's cold, and they're sick.

17:41.892 --> 17:43.690
And...

17:43.691 --> 17:49.504
And some of them, they don't have shoes,
and, you know, and some of them don't...

17:49.505 --> 17:52.264
Don't even have, like, much clothing on.

17:52.265 --> 17:54.813
They don't feel so very well.

17:54.814 --> 17:57.514
And, um, very...

17:57.804 --> 17:59.075
Um...

17:59.076 --> 18:00.534
Sad.

18:00.535 --> 18:02.815
And, um...

18:03.223 --> 18:08.023
There's no building.
There's just the Earth.

18:08.598 --> 18:11.778
All of them are dying.

18:17.957 --> 18:19.464
After speaking with Larry,

18:19.465 --> 18:22.237
he told me that Cramerton was
overrun with two epidemics.

18:22.238 --> 18:23.958
One in the early 1900s,

18:23.959 --> 18:27.715
and another one when the Native
Americans inhabited the land over here.

18:27.716 --> 18:29.759
So now I'm gonna meet
with a local historian.

18:29.760 --> 18:35.100
Maybe he can shed some light
on Cramerton's history.

18:43.838 --> 18:48.924
I'm doing an investigation regarding a
home in and around the area of Cramerton.

18:48.925 --> 18:52.251
I understand there were two major plagues
that happened in the history of this area.

18:52.252 --> 18:53.472
Right.

18:53.473 --> 18:57.085
And it would severely
debilitate the population.

18:57.086 --> 18:59.433
I had read somewhere during
the research I was doing

18:59.434 --> 19:01.618
that there was things called a Pest House?

19:01.619 --> 19:05.181
And was there a certain area where
they would keep people quarantined?

19:05.182 --> 19:08.525
The idea of a quarantined area...

19:08.526 --> 19:13.507
Was particularly associated
with diseases like um...

19:13.508 --> 19:15.081
Well, Smallpox.

19:15.082 --> 19:20.982
And there was disfigurement and
scarring, and there was isolation.

19:37.691 --> 19:40.161
There's a lot of activity inside the house,

19:40.162 --> 19:43.464
but there's even more dead people outside.

19:43.465 --> 19:49.365
And I'm being drawn to the edge of the
woods that run behind the property.

19:49.467 --> 19:53.427
I've never seen anything like it.

19:54.842 --> 19:57.690
They're going down.

19:57.691 --> 20:00.691
That's really weird.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.850
They're just... yeah, they're just going...

20:02.851 --> 20:04.952
Being sucked right into the Earth.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.167
And then the other ones
are just crawling out,

20:07.168 --> 20:11.085
crawling up, standing up, and walking.

20:11.086 --> 20:13.782
I mean, obviously, I think
there's water there.

20:13.783 --> 20:15.096
Hmm.

20:15.097 --> 20:16.177
Is that happening now?

20:16.178 --> 20:18.632
Like, the people who are
coming up, though...

20:18.633 --> 20:20.868
They don't look so good.

20:20.869 --> 20:23.828
They don't look good at
all, like, initially.

20:23.829 --> 20:27.402
Like, when they come up,
and then they're like...

20:27.403 --> 20:31.177
They're like all, ugh, and
they're, like, crawling.

20:31.178 --> 20:33.663
And then they... then they get...
and they stand up.

20:33.664 --> 20:35.721
Can you describe them?

20:35.722 --> 20:38.362
Native American.

20:40.727 --> 20:43.437
Dr. May, I know that
once white man settled,

20:43.438 --> 20:45.668
- they brought a lot of disease with them.
- Right.

20:45.669 --> 20:48.616
So when Smallpox did hit the
Native American population,

20:48.617 --> 20:50.374
what did they do with their dead?

20:50.375 --> 20:53.429
They would have used the river as a means,

20:53.430 --> 20:56.596
of disposal of the remains.

20:56.597 --> 21:00.437
To get it out of the community.

21:02.789 --> 21:05.849
They're going down...

21:07.464 --> 21:10.524
Like, into the water.

21:10.811 --> 21:15.256
They're just going. People
are coming up, walking.

21:15.257 --> 21:19.392
People... and then people are walking,
and they're going down into the Earth.

21:19.393 --> 21:22.496
Like, literally down into the Earth.

21:22.497 --> 21:25.233
Is there any kind of
opening or anything or...

21:25.234 --> 21:26.533
I don't know.

21:26.534 --> 21:30.284
Are they just kind of
walking through it? Like...

21:30.285 --> 21:32.907
No, it's like they're being sucked into it.

21:32.908 --> 21:36.042
- Like is there any kind of...
- Like...

21:36.043 --> 21:40.471
I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing.

21:40.472 --> 21:43.782
I feel kind of weird about it.

21:43.783 --> 21:48.943
Like, it's kind of freaking
me out a little bit.

22:20.353 --> 22:23.963
There are just a lot of people...

22:23.964 --> 22:27.761
Dead people that are just everywhere here.

22:27.762 --> 22:31.667
And this man came up, and
he was trying to touch me.

22:31.668 --> 22:33.689
And I don't like him.

22:33.690 --> 22:36.407
He's not a good person.

22:36.408 --> 22:38.976
And I don't know if he's,
like, manipulating himself

22:38.977 --> 22:41.112
or what because he's super tall.

22:41.113 --> 22:44.548
Like abnormal, like long
arms and long legs.

22:44.549 --> 22:47.263
It's, like, doesn't look
really normal to me.

22:47.264 --> 22:48.999
It looks really creepy.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.821
Uh...

22:50.822 --> 22:53.902
He looks like a mortician would.

22:53.903 --> 22:57.651
I see dead people every day, and
it takes a lot to scare me.

22:57.652 --> 23:00.210
But this guy scares me.

23:00.211 --> 23:01.667
And...

23:01.668 --> 23:04.332
There's this woman...

23:04.333 --> 23:06.317
Who he...

23:06.318 --> 23:09.240
Keeps prodding her...

23:09.241 --> 23:12.481
Poking her, cutting her.

23:21.584 --> 23:23.162
Digging deeper into the case,

23:23.163 --> 23:26.099
I found that they have these
places called Pest Houses

23:26.100 --> 23:30.403
that quarantined people that fell
sick to Typhoid Fever and Smallpox.

23:30.404 --> 23:34.507
In 1902 alone, there were 400 people
confined to these Pest Houses.

23:34.508 --> 23:37.510
In a town whose population was
4,000 people at the time,

23:37.511 --> 23:39.299
that's a big chunk of the people.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.720
Most interesting were the doctors
that worked in these Pest Houses

23:42.721 --> 23:48.621
and the measures that they took to prevent
themselves from getting infected.

23:59.065 --> 24:03.803
The dead man who looked like a
mortician really scared me,

24:03.804 --> 24:06.272
and I saw him very clearly.

24:06.273 --> 24:09.109
So I'm gonna have the
sketch artist draw him.

24:09.110 --> 24:12.321
So in this situation, it's
a little bit different.

24:12.322 --> 24:15.672
The reason why it's
different is because he...

24:15.673 --> 24:19.935
Is projecting how he
wants people to see him.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.936
Which is not normal.

24:23.227 --> 24:25.536
So we're gonna draw that entire person.

24:25.537 --> 24:29.974
- Is that okay?
- Okay, that's no problem.

24:29.975 --> 24:31.831
What kind of a shape, the head?

24:31.832 --> 24:34.472
It's elongated.

24:35.169 --> 24:38.702
So the thing is is that he was very thin.

24:38.703 --> 24:41.763
Like, abnormally thin.

24:45.926 --> 24:51.826
His eyes were deep-set so his cheekbones
were a little bit pronounced.

24:53.352 --> 24:55.812
That's good.

24:59.034 --> 25:00.594
What kind of clothes was he wearing?

25:00.595 --> 25:04.375
He had on a long black jacket.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.821
Okay, then, you think we're almost there?

25:11.822 --> 25:13.742
Yeah.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.543
How's that look?

25:34.250 --> 25:37.430
So I finally uncover some
real facts about this house.

25:37.431 --> 25:40.945
But that doesn't necessarily explain
these experiences that Salem's having.

25:40.946 --> 25:44.807
She's a 9-year-old kid. Frankly
I'm concerned about her.

25:44.808 --> 25:50.639
So I'm gonna break the rules a little
bit here and ask Amy for help.

25:50.640 --> 25:55.077
Amy, listen, this case has got me a
little perplexed as far as the kid.

25:55.078 --> 25:58.143
- What's her name?
- Her name is Salem.

25:58.144 --> 25:59.254
Okay.

25:59.255 --> 26:02.205
She's got an incredible
infatuation with the dead.

26:02.206 --> 26:03.831
Now she's seen apparitions.

26:03.832 --> 26:06.534
She's not afraid of the
paranormal whatsoever.

26:06.535 --> 26:08.276
I mean, she's pretty adamant about it.

26:08.277 --> 26:11.459
I've never seen a 9 year old so...

26:11.460 --> 26:13.881
Confident in the way she feels.

26:13.882 --> 26:16.509
I feel like I'm just out of
my league with this one.

26:16.510 --> 26:20.014
And I think you're better
suited to speak with her.

26:20.015 --> 26:22.585
I mean, I've talked to her as a
Detective talks to a witness,

26:22.586 --> 26:25.740
- and once she speaks with you...
- Mm hmm.

26:25.741 --> 26:28.552
I think you'll get a better idea
of what's going on than I will.

26:28.553 --> 26:32.327
You know, myself, like, when I was a
child and dealing with all of this,

26:32.328 --> 26:35.754
I was very fascinated and
fixated on death as well.

26:35.755 --> 26:38.305
Like, I would see these
things on television.

26:38.306 --> 26:42.710
Lizzie Borden, became obsessed with
that, became obsessed with Anne Frank.

26:42.711 --> 26:45.363
You have this fear of death.

26:45.364 --> 26:48.557
Because all you know of it is
these people wandering around.

26:48.558 --> 26:52.227
It's funny you mention Anne Frank because
she mentioned the same thing to me.

26:52.228 --> 26:53.632
Anne Frank specifically?

26:53.633 --> 26:54.908
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

26:54.909 --> 26:56.538
- So...
- Okay.

26:56.539 --> 26:59.000
The more you can help with her interview,

26:59.001 --> 27:04.161
I think its gonna bring a
lot more to the table.

27:12.439 --> 27:16.383
So I understand that you've
had some unusual experiences?

27:16.384 --> 27:17.296
Mm-hmm.

27:17.297 --> 27:19.386
Can you tell me about a few of those?

27:19.387 --> 27:23.156
Like, maybe two or three that
really stick out in your mind?

27:23.157 --> 27:26.436
- Well, one time, uh, in my room...
- Mm hmm.

27:26.437 --> 27:30.314
And I saw a little girl playing through my
closet, I was about like right here, and

27:30.315 --> 27:32.390
she was like right in there.

27:32.391 --> 27:35.110
In the other room or in the closet?

27:35.111 --> 27:36.435
- Closet.
- Okay.

27:36.436 --> 27:38.945
Playing through my clothes, and
it looked like she was like a,

27:38.946 --> 27:41.149
girl maybe about 7 or 8.

27:41.150 --> 27:43.873
Maybe about a year younger than me.

27:43.874 --> 27:45.129
All right.

27:45.130 --> 27:50.150
And one time, I was sleeping in
my bed, but I woke up, I feel...

27:50.151 --> 27:52.628
Feeling something, it
looked like an old woman.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.155
And I was able to feel
the pressure on the leg.

27:55.156 --> 27:56.789
- She was touching you?
- Mm hmm.

27:56.790 --> 27:58.879
Why was she touching you?

27:58.880 --> 28:02.562
Because I think I got in trouble
that day, and I fell asleep crying.

28:02.563 --> 28:04.631
- So she was comforting you?
- Mm hmm.

28:04.632 --> 28:05.901
Okay, okay.

28:05.902 --> 28:08.335
You know, Salem and I
are not that different.

28:08.336 --> 28:11.959
I started to see the dead
at a very young age, too.

28:11.960 --> 28:16.705
And hopefully I can help her understand
what she's been experiencing.

28:16.706 --> 28:21.617
How long have you been
kind of seeing the dead?

28:21.618 --> 28:23.807
Since we came here.

28:23.808 --> 28:25.729
- Since you moved here.
- Yeah.

28:25.730 --> 28:28.904
Okay, so you never had
any experiences before?

28:28.905 --> 28:33.847
No. My last house was calm. Like, it was
a brand-new house, like a modern house.

28:33.848 --> 28:36.550
- Like, nobody was able to die in it yet.
- Hmm.

28:36.551 --> 28:40.521
And so I did want to ask you
about the dolls in the house.

28:40.522 --> 28:41.614
Mm-hmm.

28:41.615 --> 28:45.859
And I want to ask you how you feel
about having all these dolls.

28:45.860 --> 28:50.180
Um, I feel pretty all right with it...

28:50.303 --> 28:53.372
Except they get in your way,
and they get on your nerves.

28:53.373 --> 28:55.079
- But not my mom, though.
- Mm hmm.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.108
She's like, don't bother them!
They're all right.

28:57.109 --> 28:59.959
- They're not living.
- Mm hmm.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.830
- Do you want them to move the dolls or...
- I want to scoot them out and...

29:03.831 --> 29:07.151
- Or stretch out the house.
- Right, right, yes.

29:07.152 --> 29:10.764
So you feel good about the friendly dead?

29:10.765 --> 29:14.241
I believe that Jesus and God
will be able to protect me.

29:14.242 --> 29:16.676
Okay, good. That's very good.

29:16.677 --> 29:21.214
So do you have any questions that you'd
like to ask or anything like that?

29:21.215 --> 29:23.822
Have you ever seen anything, like,

29:23.823 --> 29:26.743
that you believe was bad or really bad?

29:26.744 --> 29:28.999
Yes, I have.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.194
It's kind of like the living.

29:30.195 --> 29:32.335
There are some bad ones, and
there are some good ones.

29:32.336 --> 29:33.628
Ooh.

29:33.629 --> 29:38.030
Have you felt, like, really,
really calm when you see a ghost?

29:38.031 --> 29:39.954
Like, it made you happy to see it?

29:39.955 --> 29:42.886
Mm-hmm, yes, I've had some really good...

29:42.887 --> 29:45.372
Really good encounters with the dead.

29:45.373 --> 29:47.841
- Um, you okay?
- Yeah.

29:47.842 --> 29:49.702
Yeah? What's going on?

29:49.703 --> 29:52.021
- My eyes are watery.
- Okay.

29:52.022 --> 29:56.858
So, yeah, there, there
are bad entities. And...

29:56.859 --> 29:59.578
It's good that you know
to protect yourself.

29:59.579 --> 30:00.558
Mm-hmm.

30:00.559 --> 30:04.680
It took me a long time
to learn that because...

30:04.681 --> 30:08.821
- Yes, that absolutely works.
- Yeah.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.009
John, Lisa, it's good to see you again.

30:47.010 --> 30:48.634
This is my partner Amy.

30:48.635 --> 30:50.902
Now the reason we're here
is to try to give them a

30:50.903 --> 30:54.087
hand with some issues they're
having in the house.

30:54.088 --> 30:58.284
Normally I don't meet with Amy until
the end of our investigation.

30:58.285 --> 31:01.071
In this case, after speaking with Salem,

31:01.072 --> 31:03.741
I felt that I was a little
bit out of my league.

31:03.742 --> 31:06.918
I thought Amy would be better
suited to speak with her.

31:06.919 --> 31:09.758
She doesn't know what I
uncovered till the end anyway.

31:09.759 --> 31:14.027
Um, and I don't know what
she sees on her walk.

31:14.028 --> 31:17.980
So this is the part where we both find out
each other's findings in the investigation,

31:17.981 --> 31:19.365
and we share them with you.

31:19.366 --> 31:20.160
Right.

31:20.161 --> 31:23.350
Now I did a lot of research
as far as the house goes.

31:23.351 --> 31:26.978
And the house is very old.
It was built in 1900.

31:26.979 --> 31:29.332
There was a mill here years ago.

31:29.333 --> 31:34.060
Owner ran the mill and built these
homes for the people that work there.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.975
This being one of the homes.

31:35.976 --> 31:38.313
But I got to be honest with you.

31:38.314 --> 31:42.381
I didn't come up with
anything, documentation-wise,

31:42.382 --> 31:47.063
that brings me any validation
to what you've seen here.

31:47.064 --> 31:49.499
So I talked with an historian.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.624
Years ago, this was a...

31:51.625 --> 31:54.871
Large Native American area.

31:54.872 --> 31:56.077
Wow. Okay.

31:56.078 --> 32:00.561
So I wanted to know what the Native
Americans did with their dead.

32:00.562 --> 32:02.984
He mentioned that if there
were so many bodies

32:02.985 --> 32:05.101
that they couldn't do anything with them,

32:05.102 --> 32:09.850
they would throw them into
the water, in the river.

32:09.851 --> 32:12.064
They're going down...

32:12.065 --> 32:15.125
Like, into the water.

32:15.523 --> 32:16.826
They're just going.

32:16.827 --> 32:20.136
People are coming up, walking.

32:20.137 --> 32:24.384
People... and then people are walking,
and they're going down into the Earth.

32:24.385 --> 32:26.753
I mean, obviously, I think
there's water there.

32:26.754 --> 32:28.991
Hmm. Like...

32:28.992 --> 32:31.691
No, it's like they're being sucked into it.

32:31.692 --> 32:34.610
- Like is there any kind of...
- Like...

32:34.611 --> 32:37.947
I didn't get a positive feeling off of it.

32:37.948 --> 32:42.063
I felt very concerned about
what the dead were doing,

32:42.064 --> 32:44.018
and why were they being
sucked into the ground?

32:44.019 --> 32:46.603
Why were they coming out a mess?

32:46.604 --> 32:49.197
So I think that possibly,

32:49.198 --> 32:54.298
the mass disposal of their
bodies in the creek...

32:55.212 --> 32:58.752
May have harmed their souls.

33:00.714 --> 33:03.524
On top of everything else, when...

33:03.525 --> 33:05.604
Settlers came here, they brought along,

33:05.605 --> 33:08.350
their new ways, and they
also brought along disease.

33:08.351 --> 33:09.726
- Smallpox...
- Okay.

33:09.727 --> 33:12.863
- The flu, stuff like that so...
- That's something else I got.

33:12.864 --> 33:15.578
- You caught that?
- Right.

33:15.579 --> 33:19.165
You know, there was people
laying down down here.

33:19.166 --> 33:22.056
And I don't know about that.

33:22.057 --> 33:24.277
How many?

33:24.475 --> 33:27.454
People, how many people were down here?

33:27.455 --> 33:29.112
Quite a few, yes.

33:29.113 --> 33:31.778
Quite a few stacked.

33:31.779 --> 33:33.120
Ewe.

33:33.121 --> 33:35.695
Ugh, I don't know what that's about.

33:35.696 --> 33:40.316
Eh, they're like in sacks and, uh, sheets.

33:41.919 --> 33:45.328
So here's kind of the bad news.

33:45.329 --> 33:49.314
Um, there's quite a bit of activity here.

33:49.315 --> 33:53.755
Um, there's a lot of dead in the area.

33:55.650 --> 34:00.563
So this is the man that I encountered,
and he does look very strange.

34:00.564 --> 34:02.844
This is...

34:03.248 --> 34:07.628
How he looked when I initially met him.

34:08.795 --> 34:10.502
Oh, God.

34:10.503 --> 34:13.179
And then I wanted um...

34:13.181 --> 34:16.516
Them to do just his face.

34:16.516 --> 34:20.897
And that's kind of how his face looks.

34:22.110 --> 34:24.511
Oh, my God.

34:24.786 --> 34:26.378
So...

34:26.379 --> 34:29.436
He's definitely a menacing...

34:29.437 --> 34:31.152
Person.

34:31.154 --> 34:33.378
And he was looking for something.

34:33.379 --> 34:36.190
I don't know what it was, though.

34:36.190 --> 34:38.857
Well, it's interesting you
mentioned about all that,

34:38.858 --> 34:42.991
because back when we were talking about
these epidemics, when everybody was dying.

34:42.992 --> 34:46.167
They had these homes
called these Pest Houses.

34:46.168 --> 34:52.068
Now what a Pest House was was a location
where they brought all the sick.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.531
Now I came across a photo of...

34:55.532 --> 35:00.088
It's a doctor that treated these people,
like in let's say a leper colony.

35:00.089 --> 35:01.816
They wouldn't want to
get too close to their

35:01.817 --> 35:05.062
patients because they were
afraid of contamination.

35:05.063 --> 35:08.303
This is what they wore.

35:09.671 --> 35:11.531
Wow.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.081
Now I came across a photo of...

35:34.082 --> 35:38.933
It's a doctor that treated these people,
like in let's say a leper colony.

35:38.934 --> 35:42.174
This is what they wore.

35:48.572 --> 35:51.092
That's weird.

35:58.295 --> 36:01.108
These bird masks worn by
these Pest House doctors

36:01.109 --> 36:03.247
were basically like Medieval gas masks.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.716
So they went and put these
long noses on these masks

36:05.717 --> 36:07.718
because they thought it
would stop the infected air

36:07.719 --> 36:09.138
from getting into their systems.

36:09.139 --> 36:11.222
And they also wore clothes from head to toe

36:11.223 --> 36:15.091
so that their skin wouldn't be
exposed to the infected air.

36:15.092 --> 36:17.525
I mean, it looks bizarre, I don't know...

36:17.526 --> 36:21.665
He would poke them. And he was looking
for something inside of them.

36:21.666 --> 36:26.998
So he would make little cuts, and
he was looking for something.

36:26.999 --> 36:30.255
Now they did use a tool...

36:30.256 --> 36:32.510
In order to examine the
patients at that time,

36:32.511 --> 36:34.213
because they didn't want to get too close.

36:34.214 --> 36:37.652
- So they would prod at the bodies so...
- Oh.

36:37.653 --> 36:39.594
I don't know if that all
plays into what you saw.

36:39.595 --> 36:41.755
My gosh.

36:42.439 --> 36:47.504
When I was over there, this man came
up, and he was trying to touch me.

36:47.505 --> 36:50.220
He looks like a mortician.

36:50.221 --> 36:53.581
And there's this woman...

36:53.890 --> 36:56.110
Who he...

36:56.117 --> 36:58.713
Keeps prodding her...

36:58.714 --> 37:01.954
Poking her, cutting her.

37:03.105 --> 37:06.557
Oh, my gosh, this is so much to take in.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.109
Yeah.

37:08.110 --> 37:13.011
I feel like all this is from
some fiction book, or a movie.

37:13.012 --> 37:14.648
Well, do you believe us now?

37:14.649 --> 37:20.068
I tried to tell you something was
weird, but you didn't want to listen.

37:20.069 --> 37:22.527
Is it gonna bother Salem?

37:22.528 --> 37:24.388
Yes.

37:25.466 --> 37:28.363
When I spoke with Salem...

37:28.364 --> 37:31.827
And with her interest in death...

37:31.828 --> 37:34.696
And seeing the dead.

37:34.697 --> 37:35.949
Is that...

37:35.950 --> 37:38.410
Wanting to...

37:38.696 --> 37:41.906
Have these experiences...

37:41.907 --> 37:44.916
You know that saying, be
careful what you wish for?

37:44.917 --> 37:48.229
And so the dead are going to stay.

37:48.230 --> 37:51.174
And you want them here.

37:51.175 --> 37:55.369
And that want, whether it be
consciously or subconsciously,

37:55.370 --> 37:58.070
keeps them here.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.686
And I think...

38:03.687 --> 38:05.722
They...

38:05.723 --> 38:09.323
Want something bad to happen.

38:11.113 --> 38:13.405
Why do you say that they want
something bad to happen?

38:13.406 --> 38:16.697
Because the little girl just told me that.

38:16.698 --> 38:20.744
She doesn't like the people who live here.

38:20.745 --> 38:25.352
When I spoke with the little
dead girl, she indicated...

38:25.353 --> 38:29.365
That they were unhappy with the
situation, and the situation is...

38:29.366 --> 38:32.630
That they don't want you guys in the house.

38:32.631 --> 38:36.051
And that they're plotting.

38:37.664 --> 38:39.866
They want you out of the home,

38:39.867 --> 38:42.968
or they want things to
change so that the trapped,

38:42.969 --> 38:46.481
dead that are here can leave.

38:46.482 --> 38:47.989
Why are they trapped?

38:47.990 --> 38:50.410
There's too many things.

38:50.411 --> 38:53.584
There's too many dolls. There's too much.

38:53.585 --> 38:56.918
Dolls were first created...

38:56.919 --> 38:59.335
Um, in order to house the dead.

38:59.336 --> 39:01.602
Or to be vessels for the dead.

39:01.603 --> 39:07.483
Um, because they're human-looking,
but they're empty inside.

39:09.358 --> 39:13.741
So one of the things that crossed
my mind was is it possible that,

39:13.742 --> 39:17.303
some of them have been
trapped inside the dolls?

39:17.304 --> 39:19.704
I hope not.

39:19.816 --> 39:24.146
So you're options are you can
clear out the dolls or...

39:24.147 --> 39:26.405
Yeah, you can move.

39:26.406 --> 39:31.746
But basically, this is just
gonna continue to happen.

39:37.737 --> 39:40.197
It is, uh...

39:40.741 --> 39:42.288
It's very scary.

39:42.289 --> 39:47.334
What you brought us tonight is
very scary, very scary indeed.

39:47.335 --> 39:50.581
- I feel horrible. I mean...
- Yeah.

39:50.582 --> 39:53.028
- This is not what I expected.
- No.

39:53.029 --> 39:57.285
I thought it was something you could
deal with or be taken care of or...

39:57.286 --> 40:01.186
- Yeah.
- I feel really terrible.

40:02.168 --> 40:04.862
- I love my dolls. That's part of my...
- Right.

40:04.863 --> 40:07.772
- 90% of my life has to do with dolls.
- Right.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.612
And now, you know, I'm
like what should I do?

40:10.613 --> 40:12.757
Should I, you know... should I move?

40:12.758 --> 40:15.892
Or should I get rid of the dolls, or...?

40:15.893 --> 40:18.390
- I don't know. I'm just very horrified.
- Well, that's...

40:18.391 --> 40:21.824
- And I really don't feel well right now.
- Mm hmm.

40:21.825 --> 40:25.798
And it makes me scared for Salem.
I don't want her frightened.

40:25.799 --> 40:30.814
And I hate it that whoever they are
that they don't like my dolls.

40:30.815 --> 40:34.592
They don't want us in the house, but, you
know, I feel like it's my house now.

40:34.593 --> 40:37.989
- Right.
- And I don't like them going through it.

40:37.990 --> 40:43.890
And I don't know if I want to
continue living here or not.

40:44.208 --> 40:48.708
Um, also, you have the fascination with...

40:48.747 --> 40:51.605
The death and the paranormal, which,

40:51.606 --> 40:55.438
you know, they will linger around for that.

40:55.439 --> 40:58.437
Well, so far, things aren't that bad.

40:58.438 --> 41:00.670
But will it get worse?

41:00.671 --> 41:02.831
Oh, yes.

41:09.016 --> 41:11.428
I'm horrified. I just...

41:11.429 --> 41:15.346
It's just scary. It's creepy,
and it's not what I expected.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.575
You know, I'll never be comfortable again.

41:17.576 --> 41:18.617
Mm-hmm.

41:18.618 --> 41:20.760
There are ways to alleviate it.

41:20.761 --> 41:23.622
You can't stop it, but
you can alleviate it.

41:23.623 --> 41:25.250
There's ways to do that,

41:25.251 --> 41:29.527
one of them would be to remove as many
dolls from the house as possible.

41:29.528 --> 41:35.152
And then do a thorough cleaning and
cleansing of the house, top to bottom.

41:35.153 --> 41:37.596
And I can tell you how to do this.

41:37.597 --> 41:40.200
But you feel that you can
take that first step of

41:40.201 --> 41:43.987
trying to make room and
cleansing some of the dolls...

41:43.988 --> 41:45.977
- Yeah.
- And the house.

41:45.978 --> 41:48.693

41:48.694 --> 41:51.395

41:56.271 --> 41:59.330

41:59.331 --> 42:01.431

42:01.974 --> 42:07.050

42:07.051 --> 42:10.575

42:10.576 --> 42:16.150
