<i> Here's what happened.</i>

01:15.876 --> 01:18.377
<i> I was being</i>
<i> my usual charming self</i>

01:18.379 --> 01:22.214
<i> spending some quality time</i>
<i> with the Tanner lad.</i>

01:22.216 --> 01:25.851
See, when you bend
Missile Man's head<i> this way</i>

01:25.853 --> 01:29.021
he becomes
a communications satellite.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.757
- Whoa. I'm impressed.
- See?

01:31.759 --> 01:34.259
Yeah. What does
Missile man become

01:34.261 --> 01:36.795
when you bend him like this?

01:39.066 --> 01:40.966
He becomes broken!

01:40.968 --> 01:43.869
Oops. Sorry, B.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.872
Lynn, we're gonna be
late for the shower.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.707
Has anybody seen
the yellow ribbon?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.642
I don't know. What color is it?

01:50.644 --> 01:53.645
Ha! Yeah! I kill me.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.782
Ha-ha! You kill me!

01:56.784 --> 02:00.252
Brian, no arguments, it's time
to get ready for bed, okay?

02:00.254 --> 02:03.622
(Brian)
Aw, sorry, ALF, I guess
we'll have to play later.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.925
Obviously not with Missile Man.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.428
Oh, wait, here's that ribbon.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.630
But...it's wet.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.500
Forgot to tell you.
You're out of floss.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.436
Maybe there's a chance
I can find some ribbon

02:17.438 --> 02:19.238
without meat on it.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.906
Not in that drawer.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.310
I might have some meatless
ribbon in the garage.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.013
Forget the ribbon.
A blender doesn't need ribbon.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.848
Okay, you have
Joanna's number, right?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.850
We won't have any problem.
Brian's going to bed.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.119
I've got a lot of reading
to catch up on

02:34.121 --> 02:37.723
and I'm sure ALF
will find something to do.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.493
Make sure he doesn't.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.096
[telephone ringing]
Oh, I'll get it.

02:44.098 --> 02:47.432
Hey, don't worry
about the old ALFer.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.102
Channel 9's running "Psycho."

02:50.104 --> 02:53.038
Oh, by the way,
we're out of popcorn.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.774
I'll put it on the shopping list
next to floss.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.844
No chance to run out now
and get it, I suppose?

03:00.114 --> 03:02.781
Right. I'll just see
if I can scrounge

03:02.783 --> 03:04.883
a few kernels
from the sofa.

03:07.321 --> 03:10.055
Ready. What do you think?

03:10.057 --> 03:11.857
- I love that dress.
- Thanks.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.526
- 'Willie, we're leaving.'
- Oh, hold on, hold on.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.228
That-that was Herb
from the office.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.864
The computer's down,
he can't access the files.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.732
I've got to go in
and reload the back-ups.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.901
- You have to go now?
- I've got no choice.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.803
- The budget's due tomorrow.
- Oh, honey.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.206
- We can't leave Brian alone.
- I'm here.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.374
Well, maybe
I could take him with me.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.643
It's a school night.
He goes to bed in ten minutes.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.878
I'll stay.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.314
Well, you can't,
you're in the wedding party.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.815
I'm not.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.484
This is just great.
What are we gonna do now?

03:39.486 --> 03:43.021
Ahem! Hello? How about me?

03:43.023 --> 03:46.124
- For what?
- To sit with Brian.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.261
What do you think?

03:54.268 --> 03:57.035
Do I think we should let
an alien from outer space

03:57.037 --> 04:00.606
watch "Psycho" while our son
sleeps in the other room?

04:01.442 --> 04:03.008
Hey, no problem.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.911
Just leave me the keys
to the liquor cabinet.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.448
Maybe we can get
Mrs. Ochmonek to sit.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.283
Good idea. I'll call her.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.722
Nice to know
I'm trusted around here.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.291
ALF, ALF, ALF.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.861
When you ask for the keys
to the liquor cabinet--

04:22.863 --> 04:25.097
Hey, William, I was kidding!

04:25.099 --> 04:27.733
Ha-ha!
I mean, don't you get it?

04:27.735 --> 04:30.235
Do you think I'd actually
go near the liquor cabinet

04:30.237 --> 04:33.272
or even take my eyes
off the kid for a second?

04:33.274 --> 04:36.575
Come on, get with it,
these are the jokes, man.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.577
The jokes.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.279
The jokes. Yeah, oh..

04:40.281 --> 04:41.980
[laughs]

04:41.982 --> 04:44.750
I'm sorry, I-I guess
I misunderstood.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.818
I guess if we knew
you were kidding..

04:46.820 --> 04:48.587
Mrs. Ochmonek
will be here in five minutes.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.622
Thank God!

04:50.624 --> 04:52.124
Bye.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.431
So, this is my prison
for the night.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.433
It's not a prison.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.934
It's our bedroom.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.905
One man's bedroom
is another man's prison.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.940
Well, there's plenty
to keep you occupied.

05:08.942 --> 05:13.312
We've got, uh, magazines,
this is a jigsaw puzzle.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.713
Mm-hmm.

05:17.318 --> 05:20.018
- It's broken.
- That's the object.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.421
You're supposed
to put it together.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.856
Why? I didn't break it.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.192
Uh, here's your
favorite comic book.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.295
"Shanna,
Mistress of the Universe."

05:30.297 --> 05:31.863
I don't want Shanna.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.132
I want Mrs. Bates.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.935
ALF, we'll run "Psycho"
another night, okay?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.470
Now, if you can just promise

05:38.472 --> 05:42.040
that you can stay completely
away from Mrs. Ochmonek

05:42.042 --> 05:45.944
then maybe, in the future
we'll let you baby-sit.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.414
Don't toy
with my emotions, Willie.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.152
I'm not. Look...ALF..

05:54.154 --> 05:56.488
...you think you can keep
your end of this bargain?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.491
Mrs. O will never know I'm here!

05:59.493 --> 06:00.959
[doorbell dings]
I'll get it!

06:00.961 --> 06:03.829
- Oh, ALF.
- Just kidding! Just kidding!

06:03.831 --> 06:06.231
Come on,
where's the fun around here?

06:07.201 --> 06:09.835
Oh, you're a life saver,
Mrs. Ochmonek.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.971
Oh, please, it's Raquel.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.006
And it's<i> my</i> pleasure.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.908
Trevor's watching
some stupid ball game

06:16.910 --> 06:20.846
so this works out just fine.
Channel 9 is showing "Psycho."

06:20.848 --> 06:23.014
So I hear.

06:23.016 --> 06:27.185
Willie, have you been having
trouble sleeping lately?

06:27.187 --> 06:29.187
No, why?

06:29.189 --> 06:31.056
Well, far be it
for me to pry

06:31.058 --> 06:35.694
but recently it's seems your TV
has been on awfully late.

06:35.696 --> 06:36.995
You know, now you
mention it

06:36.997 --> 06:40.866
I-I really have had
trouble sleeping lately.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.534
You know, I couldn't
help but notice

06:42.536 --> 06:44.703
how much garbage you've been
putting out lately.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.538
Well, if I didn't
know any better

06:46.540 --> 06:49.040
I'd think you've been
taking in boarders.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.509
[laughs]

06:50.511 --> 06:54.079
Look, you know how it is,
when I can't sleep, I-I eat.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.815
My Trevor is the same way.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.118
Is this a new lamp?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.921
Uh, Mrs. Ochmonek,
Mrs. Ochmonek?

07:02.923 --> 07:05.390
Uh, I really have to go now.
Here's the number.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.526
I'll only be gone
a couple of hours.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.227
Don't worry about a thing.

07:09.229 --> 07:12.030
Oh, and, please, uh,
stay out of the bedroom.

07:12.032 --> 07:15.801
If-if you don't mind, it's,
uh, it's kind of a mess.

out of the bedroom."

- That's my jewelry box.
- Those are my cufflinks.

this merchandise.
