00:51.729 --> 00:54.530
Come on, you promised.

00:54.564 --> 00:57.266
I will show you

00:57.301 --> 01:00.602
if you don't tell anyone.

01:00.637 --> 01:02.638
Who would I tell, Freddie?

01:18.341 --> 01:20.609
- Wow!
- As I promised.

01:20.644 --> 01:24.380
The magnificent Vital Motion Plus. Here.

01:24.414 --> 01:26.848
Try it out.

01:26.883 --> 01:29.785
Oh, I don't know...

01:29.819 --> 01:31.887
It is harmless, my dear. Totally harmless.

01:31.921 --> 01:34.189
Actually, it will do you a power of good.

01:34.223 --> 01:37.092
How does it do a person good, Freddie?

01:37.126 --> 01:39.394
You need not worry about
the principle of the thing.

01:39.428 --> 01:42.063
- Just hop in.
- Are you sure?

01:42.098 --> 01:45.065
You won't regret it, I promise.

01:45.100 --> 01:48.503
But to experience the real benefits,

01:48.537 --> 01:50.338
the electrodes

01:50.372 --> 01:53.741
should be applied next to flesh.

01:53.776 --> 01:55.677
Oh!

01:55.711 --> 01:57.512
If you dare, my beauty!

01:57.546 --> 01:59.947
You really know

01:59.981 --> 02:03.350
how to persuade a woman.

02:10.425 --> 02:12.893
- Tea?
- Yes, please.

02:16.631 --> 02:19.032
Come in!

02:21.869 --> 02:24.304
George!

02:24.339 --> 02:26.740
- Doctor! Sir!
- Morning, George!

02:26.774 --> 02:28.908
Wonderful digs!

02:28.943 --> 02:31.144
Look at this!

02:31.178 --> 02:33.112
Splendid view of the city!

02:33.147 --> 02:36.716
Thank you, George... What
brings you here this morning?

02:36.750 --> 02:39.052
Oh, sir, pardon the interruption.

02:39.086 --> 02:41.120
You're needed. There's been a murder.

02:41.155 --> 02:44.390
Oh, I see. I'll fetch my bicycle

02:44.424 --> 02:46.292
from the hotel stables
and meet you at the scene.

02:46.327 --> 02:50.028
Well, you shouldn't need your bicycle,
sir. The murder was here. Room 206.

02:50.063 --> 02:52.832
- When was the body found?
- Early this morning

02:52.866 --> 02:55.334
by a maid. She's quite
distraught, apparently.

03:07.066 --> 03:09.100
Sir, the victim appears
to have been electrocuted.

03:09.134 --> 03:11.502
Some unfortunate mishap.

03:11.536 --> 03:13.404
Well, that would account
for the power outage

03:13.439 --> 03:16.140
we experienced last night.
And if that is the case,

03:16.175 --> 03:18.409
the time of death would
be shortly before midnight.

03:18.444 --> 03:20.979
What do we know about the victim, George?

03:21.013 --> 03:23.213
His name is Frederick
Longfellow. From his effects

03:23.247 --> 03:25.983
it seems he's a
businessman and a scientist.

03:26.017 --> 03:28.285
He's in Toronto for the big
Medical Exhibition and Emporium

03:28.319 --> 03:30.621
that opens today. I believe this...

03:30.655 --> 03:33.256
device is the thing he's trying to sell.

03:33.291 --> 03:35.726
I found a registration form in his room.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.128
This isn't his room?

03:38.162 --> 03:41.264
I found a key in his pocket for 209.

03:41.499 --> 03:43.400
Alright then.

03:43.434 --> 03:46.069
Search this room, and
leave the body in the device

03:46.104 --> 03:48.105
for Doctor Grace to examine at the morgue.

03:48.139 --> 03:50.307
Sir.

03:55.613 --> 03:58.280
- Mr. Mansfield?
- Good morning, Detective!

03:58.315 --> 04:00.650
- Morning.
- Your mail, sir.

04:00.684 --> 04:03.987
Yes. Thank you.

04:04.021 --> 04:06.890
Terrible business upstairs.
All in all too much excitement

04:06.924 --> 04:10.126
- for one night, wouldn't you say?
- Indeed. I need to know

04:10.160 --> 04:12.661
who Room 206 was registered to.

04:18.535 --> 04:20.702
Strange!

04:20.737 --> 04:23.039
The page has been torn out.

04:31.981 --> 04:33.949
I'll need to take this.

04:33.983 --> 04:36.885
Yes, yes, of course. I'm
glad you're in charge, sir.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.187
I should, um...

04:39.221 --> 04:40.856
I...

04:40.980 --> 04:43.915
Is something wrong, Mr. Mansfield?

04:43.950 --> 04:47.585
For your ears only, Detective.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.221
Of course.

04:50.256 --> 04:53.124
Mr. Longfellow came to the
hotel last night in the company

04:53.159 --> 04:56.827
of a woman. Now, a respectable
establishment such as ours

04:56.862 --> 04:59.030
frowns upon a gentleman
escorting a woman to his room.

04:59.064 --> 05:02.900
However, Mr. Longfellow
slipped me a sizable sum

05:02.934 --> 05:05.269
to look the other way.

05:05.303 --> 05:07.504
Did you see his companion?

05:07.539 --> 05:10.374
- Yes, I did.
- Can you describe her?

05:10.408 --> 05:13.510
She was a striking woman, jet black hair...

05:13.545 --> 05:16.047
Almost exotic!

05:18.249 --> 05:20.617
And you're quite sure he was electrocuted?

05:20.652 --> 05:23.253
He absolutely was. His heart had stopped.

05:23.288 --> 05:26.523
It would seem this machine
killed him. These burn marks

05:26.558 --> 05:29.193
match the oval shape of the
electrodes on the machine.

05:39.236 --> 05:42.105
- Well, that's odd!
- What's that?

05:42.139 --> 05:44.574
This current isn't enough

05:44.608 --> 05:48.111
to kill anyone. It's perfectly safe!

05:48.145 --> 05:51.514
I'll have to take it for further testing.

05:53.783 --> 05:57.019
Oh my!

06:03.493 --> 06:05.494
Edna!

06:05.529 --> 06:07.496
What brings you to the station?

06:07.531 --> 06:09.331
Well, I wanted to ask a favour of you.

06:09.365 --> 06:12.201
- For Simon.
- What's he done now?

06:12.235 --> 06:14.837
Oh! No, nothing like that.

06:14.871 --> 06:18.240
He's expressed this interest to go
to the Traveling Medical Emporium.

06:20.076 --> 06:22.410
Somewhat morbid, I guess,
but... I'm trying to encourage

06:22.445 --> 06:24.479
all law-abiding interests in the boy.

06:24.513 --> 06:26.748
Well, how can I help?

06:26.782 --> 06:28.750
Well, I've been offered a job

06:28.784 --> 06:31.720
- that I can't turn down.
- So you'd like me to take him?

06:31.754 --> 06:34.155
Yes!

06:34.189 --> 06:37.259
Edna, does Simon find it odd
that we spend time together

06:37.293 --> 06:40.928
while... I mean, he doesn't
know his father is dead, yet.

06:41.028 --> 06:43.362
I do know that I have to tell him and...

06:43.396 --> 06:45.965
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

06:47.968 --> 06:50.569
D'you wanna take him?

06:50.603 --> 06:54.473
- Yes, of course, be happy to!
- Thank you, George.

07:39.018 --> 07:40.751
George. Were you able to find

07:40.786 --> 07:43.020
- any fingermarks in Room 206?
- Yes, sir.

07:43.055 --> 07:45.156
I'm cataloguing them
now. It may take some time

07:45.191 --> 07:47.091
before I figure out who they belong to.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.326
Right. Please pull up
Thomas Edison's fingermarks

07:49.360 --> 07:51.395
- from our records.
- Edison, sir?

07:51.429 --> 07:54.865
Yes, George. Room 206 was
registered to Thomas Edison.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.076
Sorry I'm late.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.645
What have I missed?

08:08.679 --> 08:11.948
We are debating how we best
persuade the good men of Toronto

08:11.983 --> 08:14.918
- to cast their votes for the fairer sex.
- Hello,

08:14.952 --> 08:18.054
I'm Lillian Moss. Margaret
has attracted me to your cause.

08:18.089 --> 08:20.590
- Oh! Pleased. I'm Emily Grace.
- Another doctor, Lillian.

08:20.625 --> 08:24.694
- Emily is the city coroner.
- I'm already flattered by the company I'm keeping.

08:24.729 --> 08:27.463
Don't sell yourself short,
Lillian. You've already been

08:27.498 --> 08:29.833
- of great service!
- Lillian is a fellow member

08:29.867 --> 08:32.702
of the Socialist League.
They've offered to run Julia

08:32.736 --> 08:34.638
- as a candidate.
- Am I not

08:34.672 --> 08:37.039
too well-heeled for the socialists?

08:37.073 --> 08:39.508
- What about the Liberal Party?
- A woman as a Liberal candidate?

08:39.543 --> 08:41.376
In Ontario? Never!

08:41.410 --> 08:43.912
Perhaps I should run as an Independent.

08:43.947 --> 08:46.349
Unfettered by affiliation!

08:46.383 --> 08:49.118
- Are you sure, Dr. Ogden?
- I think I am.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.154
My uncle is sympathetic

08:51.188 --> 08:53.656
and a prominent Masonic Lodge member.

08:53.690 --> 08:56.158
- He's keen to meet you.
- A Socialist

08:56.192 --> 08:57.893
with connections to the Masons, no less.

08:57.927 --> 09:00.262
I've learned to get ahead in this world,

09:00.296 --> 09:02.164
you take friends no
matter where you find them.

09:02.198 --> 09:04.033
And I am much more
interested in women than I am

09:04.067 --> 09:06.568
in society's conventions.

09:06.602 --> 09:09.704
Macaroon?

09:11.674 --> 09:14.276
Excellent roast beef, Mr. Mayor.

09:14.310 --> 09:16.811
And the Yorkshire pudding was spectacular.

09:16.845 --> 09:19.113
You can always count on a
Mason meeting for a good lunch

09:19.148 --> 09:21.550
and a dollop of gossip, Brackenreid!

09:21.584 --> 09:24.752
Some of which falls in
your bailiwick, I believe.

09:24.787 --> 09:27.155
- Really?
- Your Detective...

09:27.189 --> 09:29.757
- The Catholic?
- Murdoch. What about him?

09:29.792 --> 09:32.359
I hear his wife has some
notion of running for office.

09:32.394 --> 09:34.829
Ludicrous idea. Not good for him,

09:34.863 --> 09:37.531
her breaking the law.
Last thing your boy needs.

09:37.566 --> 09:40.968
- Is she breaking the law?
- Not the letter, I gather,

09:41.003 --> 09:43.604
but certainly the intent.

09:43.638 --> 09:45.772
Have a word. He's gaining a reputation.

09:45.807 --> 09:48.542
- You mean she is.
- No difference.

09:48.577 --> 09:50.844
They are man and wife, are they not?

09:50.878 --> 09:52.879
Good day.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.286
Sir. The hotel room was registered

10:00.321 --> 10:03.389
- to Thomas Edison.
- Thomas Edison? Seriously?

10:03.424 --> 10:06.026
- What's he doing in Toronto?
- I have no idea, but it stands...

10:06.060 --> 10:08.294
He's not here for that Medical
carry-on surely. That thing's

10:08.329 --> 10:10.363
only one step removed from
those traveling medicine shows

10:10.397 --> 10:12.065
- and their snake oil salesmen!
- Sirs!

10:12.100 --> 10:13.934
- What have you, George?
- You were right, sir,

10:13.968 --> 10:16.302
Edison's fingermarks were
in Room 206. What's more

10:16.337 --> 10:18.738
is they were all over that... contraption.

10:18.772 --> 10:21.173
Longfellow electrocuted and Edison knowing

10:21.208 --> 10:24.009
a thing or two about
electricity! Makes sense.

10:24.044 --> 10:26.912
- Except for the murder bit.
- Have Longfellow and Edison

10:26.947 --> 10:29.014
- ever crossed paths before?
- They did, sir. They had

10:29.049 --> 10:31.284
a business relationship of sorts
a couple of years ago. I'm still

10:31.318 --> 10:33.652
- looking into the details.
- Business partners?

10:33.686 --> 10:36.421
That's never been motive for murder before.

10:36.456 --> 10:39.291
Time to have a word
with the gent! Carry on!

10:45.232 --> 10:47.699
Oh, Mr. Edison!

10:47.734 --> 10:50.935
Detective Murdoch. What can I do for you?

10:50.970 --> 10:52.937
I'm here to bring you in for questioning

10:52.972 --> 10:55.173
regarding the murder
of your former partner.

10:55.207 --> 10:58.410
Mr. Longfellow was found electrocuted

10:58.444 --> 11:00.712
in your hotel room, your fingermarks

11:00.747 --> 11:03.415
- on the murder weapon.
- That was not my hotel room.

11:03.449 --> 11:06.050
Your signature is in the register.

11:06.085 --> 11:09.154
Did you remove the page to
conceal your involvement?

11:09.188 --> 11:11.455
It was not my hotel room.

11:11.490 --> 11:13.892
Sir, I have your signature.

11:13.926 --> 11:16.694
- I demand your cooperation.
- That's not my signature.

11:16.728 --> 11:19.063
It's my son's.

11:19.098 --> 11:22.166
Thomas Alva Edison Junior.

11:30.991 --> 11:35.026
My son has learned to copy
my signature rather well!

11:35.061 --> 11:37.462
It can be quite convenient to be mistaken

11:37.496 --> 11:40.665
for your famous father. He adds "Jr"

11:40.700 --> 11:44.235
as an afterthought. Considerate.

11:44.269 --> 11:46.404
Mr. Edison,

11:46.438 --> 11:49.340
why were your fingermarks
found on the electrical device?

11:49.374 --> 11:52.076
I was in Room 206.

11:52.111 --> 11:54.812
I saw Longfellow. He was already dead.

11:54.846 --> 11:56.747
What time was this?

11:56.781 --> 12:00.017
After midnight? 12:30... ?

12:00.051 --> 12:01.885
Why did you not report the murder?

12:01.920 --> 12:05.189
- What would be the point?
- You felt no obligation?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.324
- No.
- Or perhaps you didn't

12:07.358 --> 12:10.393
because you thought your son
responsible. That's why you tore

12:10.428 --> 12:13.530
the page from the register. To protect him.

12:13.564 --> 12:17.167
My son is capable of many things,

12:17.201 --> 12:20.570
but not murder.

12:20.605 --> 12:23.240
What was the nature

12:23.274 --> 12:25.908
of your relationship
with Frederick Longfellow?

12:25.943 --> 12:29.346
He would bring me inventions
hoping the Edison company

12:29.380 --> 12:31.381
would invest in their commercialization.

12:31.415 --> 12:34.251
Most of these were useless.

12:34.285 --> 12:36.453
Yet, you still formed a company with him.

12:36.487 --> 12:39.756
- Why was that?
- One invention had merit.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.959
A new light bulb filament. Longfellow and I

12:42.993 --> 12:46.663
formed a company to
patent it two years ago,

12:46.697 --> 12:49.766
last time I saw him. Anything else?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.902
Yes, Mr. Edison. Why are you in Toronto?

12:52.936 --> 12:56.104
I'm looking for my son.

12:56.139 --> 12:58.240
Oh, well then, it seems

12:58.275 --> 13:02.044
our interests have converged!
Where might we find him?

13:02.078 --> 13:06.248
I believe he is working for
the Traveling Medical Emporium.

13:06.283 --> 13:08.717
He's paid by so-called inventors

13:08.751 --> 13:12.287
to lend the Edison name
to their useless products,

13:12.321 --> 13:16.091
sullying my reputation in the process.

13:21.497 --> 13:24.066
- Dr. Grace!
- Miss Moss!

13:24.100 --> 13:25.934
Lillian, please.

13:25.968 --> 13:27.669
I hope I'm not intruding.

13:27.704 --> 13:30.104
I don't think you're disturbing anyone.

13:32.274 --> 13:33.808
I came to tell you

13:33.842 --> 13:36.611
that Dr. Ogden made a very
good impression with my uncle.

13:36.645 --> 13:39.814
She has his vote, though I'm
not sure about his fellow Masons.

13:39.848 --> 13:42.250
Julia is very impressive
and has always been

13:42.284 --> 13:45.519
- an inspiration to me.
- You're a doctor as well!

13:45.553 --> 13:48.355
You're both inspirations.

13:48.389 --> 13:50.457
Could I take you for tea?

13:50.491 --> 13:53.627
Oh! I'd be delighted.

14:06.507 --> 14:09.943
Simon, look at this.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.382
Ha! Look!

14:15.416 --> 14:17.651
Sorry!

14:20.287 --> 14:22.722
Arthritis, catarrh,

14:22.757 --> 14:25.925
ailments of the blood,
the spleen, and liver.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.795
The Magno-Electric Vitalizer

14:28.829 --> 14:31.364
aids in all manner of illness.

14:31.398 --> 14:33.566
And you can surely trust a product endorsed

14:33.600 --> 14:35.868
by Thomas Alva Edison.

14:35.902 --> 14:38.704
I personally examined the
Vitalizer and indeed tried it

14:38.739 --> 14:41.240
with excellent results.
I warrant it is safe...

14:41.275 --> 14:43.376
Thomas Edison is a famous
inventor. This must be

14:43.410 --> 14:45.645
his son following in his footsteps.

14:45.679 --> 14:48.914
My father was a blacksmith
before he went off to the war.

14:48.948 --> 14:50.883
That's an admirable trade.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.152
I used to watch him work.

14:53.186 --> 14:55.254
Do you think you'll follow in his path?

14:55.288 --> 14:57.856
Me? No! It's too hot and sweaty!

14:57.891 --> 15:00.092
And where's the money
in forging horseshoes?

15:00.126 --> 15:01.927
... see more hair growth
even on my youthful head

15:01.961 --> 15:03.929
as a result of daily use.

15:03.963 --> 15:07.166
And a finer head of hair I
have yet to see, Mr. Edison!

15:07.200 --> 15:09.200
Step up! Who wants one!?

15:11.337 --> 15:13.338
Look at this!

15:17.543 --> 15:19.511
Look at this arm!

15:21.781 --> 15:24.415
This device is a modern marvel,

15:24.449 --> 15:27.285
one that can complete complex tasks

15:27.319 --> 15:30.521
a cosmetic prosthetic cannot.

15:33.258 --> 15:35.059
See how the hand moves like that, son?

15:35.093 --> 15:37.494
It's like an automaton.

15:37.529 --> 15:39.463
Nobody would mess about with
me if I had an arm like that.

15:39.497 --> 15:41.665
I'd be a mechanical man!

15:41.700 --> 15:43.634
Yes, but think about it. You'd
have to cut one of your own

15:43.668 --> 15:45.469
- perfectly good limbs off!
- Well, so what?

15:45.503 --> 15:47.871
The electrical arm is far more useful!

15:47.905 --> 15:52.676
A tool... a deadly weapon
as part of your own body!

15:52.711 --> 15:55.278
I suppose it might come in handy.

15:57.281 --> 15:58.815
What would you rather cut off, Constable?

15:58.850 --> 16:00.717
Your left or your right arm?

16:00.751 --> 16:02.752
See, you'd think the left,
because I'm right-handed,

16:02.786 --> 16:05.322
but there are a lot of
variables you need to consider.

16:05.356 --> 16:08.091
For example...

16:08.125 --> 16:10.160
... I'm sure it's what
you need, and perhaps

16:10.194 --> 16:11.928
your hair is fine for the moment...

16:11.963 --> 16:14.296
Excuse me, Mr. Edison Junior?

16:14.331 --> 16:15.998
Yes.

16:16.032 --> 16:18.200
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

16:18.235 --> 16:20.903
- I'd like to have a word.
- Of course!

16:20.937 --> 16:24.240
- What is this about, Detective?
- Where were you last night?

16:24.274 --> 16:27.176
Last night? I believe I was in a tavern.

16:27.210 --> 16:29.679
Who were you with?

16:29.713 --> 16:31.613
Mr. McBride, whom I work with.

16:31.647 --> 16:33.782
Mr. Rico from the booth across the way

16:33.816 --> 16:36.718
also joined us. What of it?

16:36.753 --> 16:39.488
- What's going on?
- A misunderstanding,

16:39.522 --> 16:41.723
I am quite sure. Tell
the Detective where I was

16:41.758 --> 16:45.159
- last night, Mr. McBride.
- Rico and I took him out drinking.

16:45.177 --> 16:46.762
I was persuading him to come work with me,

16:46.796 --> 16:49.798
- not that charlatan Longfellow.
- Until what hour?

16:49.832 --> 16:53.134
I'd say Mr. Edison here
staggered out of the tavern

16:53.168 --> 16:55.437
around eleven, just before perhaps.

16:55.471 --> 16:57.806
Well oiled, too! Singing and carrying on.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.941
As I told you.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.143
Mr. Edison,

17:02.177 --> 17:04.512
I'd like you to accompany me
to the station house, please.

17:04.546 --> 17:07.515
Is that... is that necessary?

17:07.549 --> 17:09.550
Yes, yes, it is.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.421
Thank you for coming in, Doctor Ogden.

17:13.454 --> 17:15.356
- You wanted to speak to me?
- Yes, yes, I do.

17:15.391 --> 17:17.491
Please have a seat.

17:22.830 --> 17:25.365
At the Masonic lunch, there was talk

17:25.400 --> 17:27.968
about you being a candidate
at the provincial election.

17:28.002 --> 17:31.539
I trust I can count on
your support, Inspector.

17:31.573 --> 17:34.809
A word in your ear, Doctor.
It's already caused quite a stir.

17:34.843 --> 17:37.311
Well, that is exactly our
intention. What we hope is...

17:37.345 --> 17:39.579
There'll be serious consequences.

17:39.613 --> 17:42.715
Naturally. Any attempt by
women to raise their voices

17:42.750 --> 17:45.685
- beyond a polite murmur is a challenge to almost every...
- It's not the woman's right

17:45.719 --> 17:47.587
to vote claptrap that I'm talking about!

17:47.621 --> 17:49.589
Although I am happy to offer an opinion

17:49.623 --> 17:51.491
on another occasion.

17:51.525 --> 17:53.726
No, this is about Murdoch.

17:53.761 --> 17:56.663
William and I have discussed my decision.

17:56.697 --> 17:59.332
- He completely understands!
- I'm not sure he does.

17:59.366 --> 18:03.069
- Inspector, what is this about?
- Now that you're married,

18:03.103 --> 18:06.606
Doctor, the world sees you
differently. You're his property

18:06.640 --> 18:10.343
and whether you like it or not,
your actions are his actions.

18:10.377 --> 18:12.411
That is not how William
and I view our marriage,

18:12.446 --> 18:14.113
- as you well know!
- Listen to me,

18:14.147 --> 18:16.282
you making a public spectacle of yourself

18:16.316 --> 18:18.917
will not sit well with
Murdoch's political masters.

18:18.952 --> 18:22.154
And legitimately standing
for political office

18:22.189 --> 18:23.990
is not a spectacle, sir.

18:24.024 --> 18:27.125
Oh for God's sake, woman!
Be realistic for once!

18:29.295 --> 18:32.430
This is none of your affair, Inspector.

18:37.904 --> 18:41.373
Mr. Edison,

18:41.407 --> 18:44.376
how did you know Frederick Longfellow?

18:44.410 --> 18:47.312
I lent the Edison name
to his latest invention,

18:47.346 --> 18:50.081
the Vital Motion Plus.

18:50.116 --> 18:52.350
And when did you last see him?

18:52.385 --> 18:54.652
Yesterday. I left him
at the Exhibition Hall

18:54.686 --> 18:56.787
before I met up with McBride and Rico.

18:56.822 --> 18:58.956
Ah yes, you work for Mr. McBride now.

18:58.991 --> 19:02.326
- Why is that?
- My name sells their products

19:02.360 --> 19:06.063
like hot cakes. Frederick
was not giving me the respect

19:06.097 --> 19:08.766
I felt I deserved, so
I took McBride's offer.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.136
Detective, why are you
asking me these questions?

19:12.170 --> 19:15.305
Frederick Longfellow was found murdered

19:15.340 --> 19:18.108
in your hotel room.

19:18.143 --> 19:22.012
My hotel room?

19:22.047 --> 19:24.781
- That's impossible.
- Out of my way!

19:24.815 --> 19:27.851
Do you know who I am?

19:27.885 --> 19:31.255
Is my son under arrest?

19:31.289 --> 19:32.989
Mr. Edison.

19:33.024 --> 19:35.258
He's assisting me with my inquiries.

19:35.292 --> 19:36.960
Then I trust you'll have no objection

19:36.994 --> 19:38.995
to me joining your interview.

19:39.030 --> 19:41.330
Chop-chop!

19:44.702 --> 19:47.871
- Thomas.
- Father. This is bewildering. I've...

19:47.905 --> 19:51.274
Just answer the Detective's questions.

19:51.308 --> 19:53.609
Mr. Edison,

19:53.643 --> 19:57.880
how did your fingermarks come
to be on Mr. Longfellow's device?

19:57.914 --> 20:00.916
- What of it?
- Well, the man was electrocuted

20:00.951 --> 20:02.718
by his own invention, so I ask again:

20:02.752 --> 20:05.721
- how did your fingermarks come to be on it?
- The thing was in his room.

20:05.755 --> 20:08.057
- Of course he touched it.
- Before we left

20:08.091 --> 20:10.859
for the Exhibition Hall
last evening, I examined

20:10.894 --> 20:13.662
the Vital Motion Plus quite thoroughly.

20:13.697 --> 20:15.798
I do not lend my name
without knowing what it is

20:15.832 --> 20:18.533
- I am endorsing.
- Hm.

20:18.568 --> 20:22.237
How does the Vital Motion Plus work?

20:22.271 --> 20:24.606
A mild current

20:24.640 --> 20:28.110
runs through the electrodes.
I actually gave Frederick

20:28.144 --> 20:31.113
a couple of suggestions to help
improve the machine's potency...

20:31.147 --> 20:33.348
- but the man thought that...
- Don't make things worse!

20:33.382 --> 20:35.049
- He knew better than an Edison!
- That machine is a sham!

20:35.084 --> 20:37.885
- Did you learn nothing from me, boy?
- I am no longer

20:37.920 --> 20:40.054
in short trousers, Father.
I can make my own decisions.

20:40.089 --> 20:42.256
Yes. And destroy the good
name of Edison in the process.

20:42.290 --> 20:46.227
Gentlemen, if I may. Mr. Edison... Junior,

20:46.261 --> 20:49.864
where did you go after you
left Mr. McBride and Mr. Rico?

20:52.367 --> 20:55.102
- I actually don't remember.
- For God's sake.

20:55.137 --> 20:57.004
I was in the land of drink,

20:57.038 --> 21:00.274
sir. I'm ashamed to say that
this is not the first occasion

21:00.308 --> 21:02.676
- I have lost time to the bottle.
- Be quiet.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.411
You don't know what you are saying.

21:04.446 --> 21:07.370
Land sakes, Father, I can handle
this. I don't need you interfering!

21:07.371 --> 21:08.349
Gentlemen, please...

21:08.383 --> 21:11.184
Don't you have somewhere important
to be? A patent to file, perhaps?

21:11.218 --> 21:13.920
If there's nothing further, we're leaving.

21:13.955 --> 21:16.523
Thomas, come!

21:16.557 --> 21:19.259
You'll be hearing from
our lawyer, Detective.

21:22.463 --> 21:25.098
Detective!

21:25.133 --> 21:27.933
I extracted these fibres
from the victim's mouth.

21:27.968 --> 21:30.236
A cotton cloth of some
kind was stuffed into

21:30.271 --> 21:33.339
- his mouth and then removed.
- A handkerchief?

21:33.374 --> 21:35.475
There is a second colour of fibre

21:35.509 --> 21:38.578
- which would suggest...
- ... A monogram.

21:40.914 --> 21:44.249
Mr. Edison! Mr. Edison,

21:44.284 --> 21:46.451
- a question if you will.
- Me?

21:46.486 --> 21:49.421
Yes. It would appear that
you were the first person

21:49.455 --> 21:51.791
to see Frederick
Longfellow after his death.

21:51.825 --> 21:54.093
What was in his mouth?

21:54.127 --> 21:57.262
I don't recall there being anything.

21:57.297 --> 21:59.799
You're lying. Answer the question.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.866
I don't see how this has anything to do...

22:01.901 --> 22:03.802
What are you trying to hide, Mr. Edison?

22:03.836 --> 22:06.871
What evidence did you remove
from the scene of the crime?

22:06.906 --> 22:09.007
That is preposterous!

22:09.041 --> 22:11.643
Detective!

22:11.678 --> 22:14.246
Well, well, well!

22:14.280 --> 22:17.782
It would seem I have to arrest you

22:17.817 --> 22:20.351
for the murder of Frederick Longfellow.

22:20.385 --> 22:23.354
- No need, that's my handkerchief.
- Thomas!

22:23.388 --> 22:25.456
I must have misplaced it somehow.

22:25.490 --> 22:28.026
- Ah! Misplaced!
- I see.

22:28.060 --> 22:30.829
I have no doubt that these fibres,

22:30.863 --> 22:33.031
which were found in
Frederick Longfellow's mouth,

22:33.065 --> 22:35.132
will match those of this handkerchief.

22:37.135 --> 22:39.803
Mr. Edison Junior, I'm
afraid I must detain you

22:39.838 --> 22:42.372
on suspicion of murder.

22:52.318 --> 22:55.487
Sir, why did you not charge Edison Junior?

22:55.521 --> 22:57.955
Because it troubles me
that I can't figure out

22:57.990 --> 23:01.158
what caused the deadly
current that killed Longfellow.

23:01.192 --> 23:03.995
All these connections
appear to be in order.

23:04.029 --> 23:06.230
When I was at the Medical
Exhibition, sir, I saw

23:06.264 --> 23:08.766
a prosthetic hand that ran on electricity.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.068
- Fully functional?
- Yes, sir.

23:11.102 --> 23:13.470
Must be the work of a
great scientific mind!

23:13.505 --> 23:16.173
Sir it was uncanny. I wonder
if the future will allow

23:16.207 --> 23:18.108
for electronic body parts to replace

23:18.143 --> 23:20.844
our hands or hair or...

23:20.878 --> 23:24.014
- Hair?
- Well, yes sir,

23:24.049 --> 23:26.283
a toupee of sorts, but
if you were frightened,

23:26.317 --> 23:28.085
an electric charge would
cause it to stand on end.

23:28.119 --> 23:31.321
Aha! George,

23:31.356 --> 23:34.791
have a look right here.
A piece of frayed cloth

23:34.825 --> 23:36.492
that matches the sheathing

23:36.527 --> 23:40.630
on the AC wire that comes in
this side of the transformer.

23:40.665 --> 23:43.332
- You think it was disconnected?
- I believe so.

23:43.367 --> 23:46.636
- That would certainly bypass the transformer.
- So it must have

23:46.671 --> 23:49.005
- been reconnected.
- But not before

23:49.040 --> 23:51.907
delivering the deadly current
that killed Longfellow.

23:54.511 --> 23:56.612
Mr. Edison, I have a few more questions.

23:56.646 --> 23:58.714
Detective, I don't know
how that handkerchief

23:58.748 --> 24:01.484
- got in Frederick's mouth.
- You really have

24:01.518 --> 24:03.553
no recollection of where
you went that night?

24:03.587 --> 24:06.389
None at all. I woke up in a tavern

24:06.423 --> 24:09.191
in the west end the morning I
was to appear at the Exhibition.

24:09.225 --> 24:11.493
Certainly not a convincing alibi.

24:11.527 --> 24:14.129
It is the only one I have.

24:14.163 --> 24:15.898
Right then.

24:15.932 --> 24:19.068
The Vital Motion Plus
requires a transformer...

24:19.102 --> 24:21.904
Of course. You cannot shoot direct current

24:21.938 --> 24:23.972
into a machine like that.
You'll electrocute the user.

24:24.006 --> 24:26.475
Direct current?

24:26.509 --> 24:28.477
Don't you mean alternating current?

24:28.511 --> 24:31.346
Really, Detective, direct means: directly!

24:31.380 --> 24:34.082
Clearly more powerful
than a current that goes

24:34.117 --> 24:37.652
back and forth. Even someone
with a rudimentary knowledge

24:37.686 --> 24:40.187
of electricity knows that.

24:40.222 --> 24:45.559
I believe you may have
this confused, Mr. Edison.

24:45.594 --> 24:49.196
A rectifier converts alternating
current to direct current.

24:49.231 --> 24:52.266
The transformer simply changes the voltage.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.201
Does it?

24:54.236 --> 24:56.403
Are you sure?

24:56.438 --> 24:58.405
Quite sure.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.974
To tell the truth,

25:01.009 --> 25:03.944
I never really grasped the
fundamentals of electricity.

25:03.978 --> 25:06.847
But there's no need to
share that with my father,

25:06.881 --> 25:09.350
is there, Detective? He might be,

25:09.384 --> 25:11.385
shall we say, disappointed.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.760
I trust you got everything sorted, Murdoch?

25:19.794 --> 25:23.596
- Sir, I've interviewed Edison Junior and...
- I meant with your wife,

25:23.631 --> 25:26.867
- the good doctor.
- Sirs!

25:26.901 --> 25:28.735
- What have you, George?
- Edison Junior

25:28.770 --> 25:31.504
has endorsed various
devices, my favourite being

25:31.539 --> 25:34.073
the Solid Gold Wizard Fountain Pen.

25:34.107 --> 25:36.742
But nothing seems to warrant
a dispute with Longfellow

25:36.777 --> 25:38.811
- worthy of murder.
- It could be over anything.

25:38.845 --> 25:41.581
Junior's touting for another
inventor now. Isn't that enough?

25:41.615 --> 25:44.551
Sir, I now don't think that he's our man.

25:44.585 --> 25:48.054
The murder was committed by
skillfully bypassing elements

25:48.088 --> 25:50.990
of the transformer. I
don't think Edison Junior

25:51.024 --> 25:53.125
had the technical know-how to do that.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.427
Well, what about the evidence
against him? The dead man was

25:55.461 --> 25:57.797
killed in his room. Fingermarks
all over the machine.

25:57.831 --> 25:59.999
And Junior's handkerchief was
stuffed in the victim's mouth.

26:00.033 --> 26:03.101
All very convenient.

26:03.135 --> 26:05.804
What about this mystery lady
last seen with Longfellow?

26:05.838 --> 26:08.073
- Any luck tracking her down?
- Well, the clerk's account:

26:08.107 --> 26:10.442
dark hair, exotic...
perhaps a lady of the night?

26:10.476 --> 26:12.911
We're circulating her description now.

26:12.945 --> 26:15.046
A needle in the proverbial haystack.

26:15.081 --> 26:16.981
Anyway, that's enough for today, gentlemen.

26:17.016 --> 26:19.517
Some of us have got wives to go home to.

26:22.521 --> 26:24.956
I don't know why the Inspector
felt the need to interfere!

26:24.990 --> 26:26.958
I felt as though I was
in front of the headmaster

26:26.992 --> 26:29.828
- to account for my naughtiness!
- Mr. Mansfield.

26:29.862 --> 26:32.030
- Evening, Detective Murdoch.
- That's what you get for asking him

26:32.064 --> 26:35.666
to walk you down the aisle:
unwanted fatherly advice.

26:35.701 --> 26:38.302
You should have heard him.
"Your actions are his actions!"

26:38.337 --> 26:41.305
Am I to be forever
hamstrung by such a backward

26:41.340 --> 26:44.275
- view of marriage?
- Let's not let society

26:44.309 --> 26:47.345
constrain us, Julia, no
matter what the consequences.

26:47.379 --> 26:50.147
We're a modern couple
living in a modern world.

26:50.181 --> 26:52.382
Absolutely.

26:52.416 --> 26:54.317
But what consequences do you mean?

26:54.352 --> 26:57.420
Will you be censured if I run for election?

26:57.455 --> 27:00.657
Oh, tongues will wag, ancient
history will be dragged up.

27:00.691 --> 27:03.160
But your position is
not in jeopardy, surely?

27:03.194 --> 27:05.195
I'll steel myself for a strong talking-to

27:05.230 --> 27:07.998
by the Chief Constable.
There'll be veiled warnings...

27:08.032 --> 27:10.400
Warnings? They might dismiss you?

27:10.434 --> 27:12.469
- Oh, I didn't say that.
- That is ridiculous.

27:12.503 --> 27:15.472
My reputation stands for something.

27:15.506 --> 27:18.541
And I'm sure the Inspector will
back me if it comes to that.

27:18.576 --> 27:20.710
William, you should not
be put in that position!

27:20.745 --> 27:23.380
Julia, we are husband and wife.

27:23.414 --> 27:27.083
We stand together, no
matter what comes our way.

27:34.191 --> 27:36.392
I won't be charging your
son with murder just yet.

27:36.426 --> 27:38.761
Oh, that's a relief. Why not?

27:38.796 --> 27:41.697
- I believe he's been set up.
- Who would do that?

27:41.731 --> 27:43.732
I was about to ask you that very question.

27:43.767 --> 27:46.669
Ah! My son has never been

27:46.703 --> 27:50.038
particularly discriminating
about the company he keeps.

27:50.072 --> 27:53.542
I don't know why, but the boy

27:53.576 --> 27:56.111
has never applied himself.

27:56.145 --> 27:57.879
He's been...

27:57.914 --> 28:00.115
lackadaisical since his school days.

28:00.149 --> 28:02.417
- That must be frustrating.
- Frustrating?

28:02.451 --> 28:06.721
I am at my wit's end. Sorry
I can't help you, Detective.

28:06.755 --> 28:09.257
Do you have any other leads?

28:09.292 --> 28:12.093
Yes. We're looking for the
woman that was last seen

28:12.128 --> 28:15.396
with Mr. Longfellow.
Quite likely a prostitute.

28:15.431 --> 28:21.202
Ha! That woman was no prostitute,
I can assure you of that.

28:21.236 --> 28:23.237
- Why do you say that?
- Longfellow was

28:23.271 --> 28:24.806
too cheap to pay for a woman.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.442
At the beginning of any
Exhibition, he'd find himself

28:27.476 --> 28:29.977
a pretty young demonstrator to consort with

28:30.011 --> 28:31.846
and he'd drop her like a
hot potato when the next crop

28:31.880 --> 28:36.050
of young girls came by. Dreadful habit.

28:36.084 --> 28:38.252
Sir,

28:38.286 --> 28:40.387
while these ladies are
quite fetching, none of them

28:40.421 --> 28:42.823
really match the description
of our mystery woman.

28:42.858 --> 28:45.425
Right. I suggest we split up, George.

28:45.460 --> 28:46.961
You take this side of the pavilion.

28:46.995 --> 28:48.995
Sir.

28:58.906 --> 29:02.442
Detective. When will I
get Thomas Edison back?

29:02.477 --> 29:04.477
My sales have plummeted without him.

29:04.511 --> 29:06.679
Mr. Edison is currently
a guest of Station House

29:06.713 --> 29:10.283
Number Four and will remain as such
until this investigation is concluded.

29:10.285 --> 29:11.851
Then what are you lot doing

29:11.886 --> 29:13.486
- wandering around here?
- Sir.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.889
Just a moment, George.
Actually, we are looking

29:15.923 --> 29:18.157
for a woman who was
seen with Mr. Longfellow.

29:18.192 --> 29:19.926
- Sir!
- Perhaps an employee

29:19.960 --> 29:23.763
- of the Emporium.
- Sir! She's right there.

29:23.797 --> 29:25.330
Oh!

29:25.365 --> 29:28.299
Good work, George.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.735
This tincture is guaranteed to heal

29:30.770 --> 29:33.037
all small cuts and aid
in the removal of warts

29:33.071 --> 29:36.408
- and other blemishes.
- Ahem! Excuse me, Miss.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.010
Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

29:39.044 --> 29:42.346
- What can I do for you?
- What is your name?

29:42.381 --> 29:45.716
- Anna Rico.
- Miss Rico, you are

29:45.750 --> 29:47.651
Mr. Rico's daughter?

29:47.685 --> 29:49.820
- Yes!
- Why are you not working

29:49.854 --> 29:52.290
- at his booth?
- I am employed by the Emporium,

29:52.324 --> 29:54.325
- not just one booth owner.
- Ah!

29:54.359 --> 29:56.860
You knew Frederick Longfellow?

29:56.895 --> 29:59.496
Yes. I met him

29:59.531 --> 30:02.399
when he was setting up
here. Such terrible news.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.401
You were seen with him the night he died.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.804
He took me for dinner.

30:06.838 --> 30:09.440
And then?

30:09.474 --> 30:12.543
He suggested...

30:12.577 --> 30:16.479
- a nightcap at his hotel.
- And you went?

30:16.513 --> 30:19.049
He seemed to be a gentleman

30:19.083 --> 30:21.384
and I suppose I was
flattered by the attention.

30:21.419 --> 30:24.220
What happened once you were at the hotel?

30:24.255 --> 30:27.390
Frederick tipped the hotel
clerk to look the other way

30:27.425 --> 30:29.993
and we went up to the rooms.

30:30.027 --> 30:33.429
- He wanted to show me something.
- Anna?

30:33.464 --> 30:36.999
Detective. What is happening?

30:37.033 --> 30:39.569
I have a few questions for Miss Rico.

30:39.603 --> 30:42.404
- What kind of questions?
- I should get back to work,

30:42.439 --> 30:44.740
- if you don't mind.
- Please, Miss Rico,

30:44.775 --> 30:48.444
- continue.
- Speak up, Anna.

30:48.479 --> 30:52.414
We walked into a hotel room.

30:52.449 --> 30:55.951
The machine he had invented was there.

30:55.986 --> 30:58.387
He wanted to show it to you.

30:58.421 --> 31:02.191
I think rather he was trying to seduce me.

31:02.225 --> 31:04.593
I'm sorry, Papa.

31:04.627 --> 31:06.194
I should not have gone that night.

31:06.228 --> 31:08.129
What happened after that?

31:10.299 --> 31:12.868
I was about to get into the machine...

31:12.902 --> 31:15.269
there was a knock at the door.

31:15.304 --> 31:18.039
Another man came in. He was very drunk.

31:18.073 --> 31:20.742
I began to think it
was not such a good idea

31:20.776 --> 31:24.278
to be in a hotel room
with two men. So I left.

31:24.313 --> 31:27.748
This man that came to the
hotel, would you recognize him?

31:27.782 --> 31:30.951
Answer, Anna.

31:30.986 --> 31:33.488
You have to tell the
Detective everything you know.

31:35.391 --> 31:37.492
Yes. I recognized him.

31:37.526 --> 31:40.027
He works here at the Exhibition.

31:40.061 --> 31:41.996
Who is he?

31:42.030 --> 31:45.432
Thomas Edison Junior.

31:48.416 --> 31:50.122
In light of this new information,

31:50.123 --> 31:52.425
your son will have to remain
in custody, Mr. Edison.

31:52.426 --> 31:53.416
I see.

31:53.418 --> 31:56.953
- I've arranged for a good lawyer.
- Would you like to see him?

31:56.988 --> 32:00.124
I don't think so. It's a
matter for the courts now.

32:02.127 --> 32:04.361
It's a hard pill to swallow
discovering your son's

32:04.395 --> 32:06.696
- a murderer.
- Sir, I'm convinced

32:06.731 --> 32:09.099
- there's more to this.
- Can't argue with the evidence,

32:09.134 --> 32:11.501
now that there's an eyewitness.
Are you sure you're not being

32:11.535 --> 32:15.038
- blinded by his pedigree?
- Sir, there are several possibilities.

32:15.072 --> 32:18.407
For example, Anna Rico
also works for Mr. McBride,

32:18.442 --> 32:22.112
Longfellow's rival. The two of
them could be up to something.

32:22.146 --> 32:24.514
Have Crabtree see what he
can come up with on her,

32:24.548 --> 32:26.816
though I doubt you will
find anything. Sometimes

32:26.851 --> 32:28.817
it's just what's in front of you.

32:28.852 --> 32:31.254
- Sir.
- Murdoch,

32:31.288 --> 32:34.390
did my word with the Doctor sink in?

32:34.424 --> 32:36.725
Julia told me you spoke with her.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.762
- Good. So it's sorted?
- Very much so.

32:39.796 --> 32:42.064
I fully support her decision to run.

32:42.098 --> 32:45.500
I'm going to give this
to you straight, Murdoch.

32:45.535 --> 32:48.336
Your wife's actions are
jeopardizing your position

32:48.371 --> 32:52.074
- within the Constabulary.
- Sir, the world is changing...

32:52.108 --> 32:55.443
So I'm bloody told. I know
you've married a firebrand

32:55.478 --> 32:58.814
and she's the persuasive
type, but you're her husband.

32:58.848 --> 33:00.682
What you say goes.

33:00.716 --> 33:04.018
Wear the trousers for once, man!

33:06.556 --> 33:09.757
This matter is closed.

33:09.792 --> 33:15.963
I'll look into Anna Rico for you, sir.

33:22.805 --> 33:24.939
We could have a poster of
Julia dressed as Liberty.

33:24.973 --> 33:27.341
Oh, come on, you don't
like the idea of Liberty?

33:27.375 --> 33:31.512
It's stirring. Very Boadicea et al...

33:31.546 --> 33:34.181
A female warrior, that, I like.

33:34.216 --> 33:36.517
- A warrior princess!
- Oh now, she doesn't have to be a princess.

33:36.551 --> 33:39.253
Emily, hello!

33:39.287 --> 33:41.655
Miss Moss! Am I interrupting?

33:41.690 --> 33:43.624
Not at all. We were just
going over some ideas

33:43.658 --> 33:46.493
for your publicity.

33:46.528 --> 33:49.363
- Is something wrong?
- Actually,

33:49.397 --> 33:51.664
I came to tell you that I'm
withdrawing from the election.

33:51.699 --> 33:53.666
- What?
- I think it's for the best.

33:53.701 --> 33:56.870
- I bring a lot of controversy with me.
- Why does that matter?

33:56.904 --> 34:00.006
- It's about taking a stand!
- I really feel quite strongly

34:00.041 --> 34:02.042
about this, Emily. I'm
not the right candidate.

34:02.076 --> 34:05.411
Will you give us a moment?

34:05.446 --> 34:08.281
Julia!

34:08.315 --> 34:11.484
Why are you giving up so easily?

34:11.518 --> 34:14.085
I'm not giving up. It just need not be me

34:14.121 --> 34:16.356
- on the campaign poster.
- This is about the Detective,

34:16.389 --> 34:18.491
isn't it? Let me guess. He doesn't approve.

34:18.525 --> 34:21.092
On the contrary, he
completely supports my running.

34:21.128 --> 34:23.328
He's almost more enthusiastic than I am.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.065
Then what is the problem?

34:26.099 --> 34:29.168
What I do directly impacts upon William.

34:29.202 --> 34:31.170
I have to take that into consideration.

34:31.204 --> 34:33.873
If you weren't married to him,

34:33.907 --> 34:36.074
what would you do?

34:36.109 --> 34:38.010
Emily,

34:38.043 --> 34:41.146
this matter is closed.

34:45.717 --> 34:49.219
When a woman marries, she
loses a piece of herself.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.790
- So it seems.
- I do know a place

34:51.824 --> 34:54.092
that will serve a woman a good stiff drink.

34:54.126 --> 34:57.695
Then I would like to
know where that place is.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.932
Anna Rico? I don't know any Anna Rico.

35:00.966 --> 35:03.968
- What are you asking me for?
- She claims you arrived

35:04.003 --> 35:07.105
at the hotel room not half
an hour before Mr. Longfellow

35:07.139 --> 35:09.340
- was murdered.
- Why would a woman I've never met

35:09.374 --> 35:11.676
lie about me?

35:11.710 --> 35:14.645
I must have been there.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.080
Maybe I am your killer, Detective.

35:17.115 --> 35:21.084
Well, the evidence certainly
points towards you, Mr. Edison.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.688
Are you sure you remember nothing?

35:23.722 --> 35:26.590
Sadly, I don't.

35:26.625 --> 35:30.460
Has my father asked about
me? He hasn't visited.

35:30.494 --> 35:34.064
He has arranged for a good lawyer for you.

35:34.098 --> 35:36.099
Of course he has. He wouldn't want

35:36.134 --> 35:38.668
the Edison name sullied.

35:44.775 --> 35:47.510
Sir, I've been doing
that search you asked for.

35:47.545 --> 35:51.013
Rico? It's an uncommon surname,
but I found a court document

35:51.048 --> 35:53.616
filed a couple of years
ago by a Georgio Rico.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.585
- Georgio Rico?
- Yes, sir.

35:55.619 --> 35:57.987
But it was witnessed by his sister Anna.

35:58.021 --> 36:00.724
Now, as it turns out, Georgio
Rico was trying to win back

36:00.758 --> 36:04.426
a patent for this long
lasting light bulb filament.

36:04.461 --> 36:06.628
He was suing Frederick Longfellow, sir,

36:06.663 --> 36:09.598
- and Mr. Edison Senior.
- Of course I remember Georgio.

36:09.632 --> 36:11.600
Good brain!

36:11.634 --> 36:14.303
Longfellow brought me
his filament invention.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.073
- And you patented it.
- Yes. Longfellow and I formed

36:17.107 --> 36:19.375
a company and put it into production.

36:19.409 --> 36:22.378
Very successful it was, too.

36:22.412 --> 36:24.512
And Mr. Rico's involvement?

36:24.546 --> 36:27.415
The young man was remunerated for his work,

36:27.449 --> 36:30.284
but he did not grasp the business side

36:30.318 --> 36:32.887
of things, hence the lawsuit.

36:32.921 --> 36:36.457
- Do you know where we might be able to find him?
- Sadly,

36:36.492 --> 36:39.794
there was a tragic end
after the lawsuit failed.

36:39.828 --> 36:42.029
Suicide, I understand.

36:42.063 --> 36:44.531
A shame really.

36:44.565 --> 36:46.733
The lad had talent.

36:46.768 --> 36:50.037
Gentlemen.

36:52.941 --> 36:56.010
I almost feel sorry for
Junior with a father like that.

36:56.044 --> 36:59.846
With her brother's tragic death after
a failed lawsuit, that would certainly

36:59.881 --> 37:02.015
give Anna Rico motive for murder.

37:02.049 --> 37:04.183
It would indeed.

37:06.253 --> 37:08.288
Sirs,

37:08.322 --> 37:10.290
I spoke to Mr. Mansfield, the desk clerk.

37:10.324 --> 37:12.893
He confirms that Anna
Rico was in the hotel lobby

37:12.927 --> 37:14.994
at the time of the power
outage at quarter to midnight.

37:15.029 --> 37:18.197
He didn't see anybody else of
note coming or going that night.

37:18.232 --> 37:20.199
Thank you, George.

37:20.234 --> 37:23.502
So she's not our murderer.
Edison Junior did it.

37:23.537 --> 37:26.306
Well, sir, there is another possibility.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.507
Anna Rico could be involved.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.876
- How?
- Well, she could easily

37:30.911 --> 37:32.912
have lured Longfellow into his machine.

37:32.946 --> 37:35.681
Once strapped in, let
someone else into the room.

37:35.715 --> 37:39.184
Someone who may have had
reason to want Longfellow dead.

37:39.218 --> 37:42.555
Why frame Edison Junior? He had
nothing to do with the business dealings

37:42.589 --> 37:45.390
that caused the brother's
suicide. That was Edison Senior.

37:45.425 --> 37:47.392
Sir,

37:47.427 --> 37:49.694
if you want to truly punish a man...

37:49.728 --> 37:53.131
You take his son.

37:57.236 --> 37:59.204
Mr. Rico.

37:59.238 --> 38:02.274
You took advantage of
Edison's weakness for drink,

38:02.308 --> 38:04.876
knowing that he would remember nothing.

38:04.910 --> 38:08.245
Your daughter Anna let you into the
room, where you rigged the machine

38:08.280 --> 38:11.015
to electrocute Longfellow, leaving behind

38:11.049 --> 38:13.284
a trail of clues you knew we would find.

38:13.318 --> 38:16.788
Including an eyewitness.

38:16.822 --> 38:18.790
Why, Mr. Rico?

38:18.824 --> 38:20.992
Georgio,

38:21.026 --> 38:22.994
he was a genius.

38:23.028 --> 38:25.396
I joined the traveling exhibition,

38:25.430 --> 38:28.466
selling my wares like a
common showman to support him.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.069
He took over my workshop.

38:32.104 --> 38:35.406
The electrical limb was his invention.

38:35.440 --> 38:38.008
The filament for the
light bulb was another.

38:40.011 --> 38:42.579
His life was just beginning
when it was cut short

38:42.614 --> 38:45.081
by the greed of those men.

38:54.058 --> 38:56.559
Mr. Rico, you are under arrest for murder.

39:08.672 --> 39:12.808
You! You would have seen
my son hang for murder!

39:12.843 --> 39:15.344
- You killed mine.
- What?

39:15.378 --> 39:17.947
- I did no such thing!
- You took his life

39:17.981 --> 39:20.783
as much as if you had tied the
rope around his neck yourself.

39:20.817 --> 39:23.485
Why my son? Why not me?

39:23.520 --> 39:26.355
I wanted you to know how I feel.

39:26.389 --> 39:29.724
To grow old without your
beloved boy at your side.

39:29.759 --> 39:32.961
What greater pain can there be

39:32.995 --> 39:35.797
than to lose one's son?

39:35.831 --> 39:38.367
Take me away, Detective.

39:38.701 --> 39:40.402
I am ready.

39:51.466 --> 39:55.405
- Mister Edison. You're free to go.
- Thank you, Detective.

40:02.548 --> 40:05.650
- Goodbye, father.
- I would like to wish you well.

40:05.685 --> 40:08.720
- Then do so. Is it so hard?
- Have you learned nothing

40:08.754 --> 40:12.190
- from your time in the cells?
- Yes. That my father would leave me there to rot.

40:12.224 --> 40:14.893
- Patently untrue. Tell him, Detective...
- Gentlemen.

40:14.927 --> 40:17.961
Given the tragic circumstances
surrounding this case,

40:17.996 --> 40:20.231
perhaps it would be a good idea

40:20.265 --> 40:22.833
for you to come to some sort
of civilized arrangement.

40:22.867 --> 40:25.169
I can see no way forward while the boy

40:25.204 --> 40:28.165
insists on using the Edison name
to endorse worthless products.

40:28.166 --> 40:29.106
I have to live.

40:29.107 --> 40:32.176
- I cannot do so without an income.
- What do you suggest that I do?

40:32.211 --> 40:35.345
- If you had paid attention at school...
- Perhaps I can help

40:35.379 --> 40:38.548
- find a compromise that's acceptable to both parties.
- Like what?

40:38.583 --> 40:40.650
Ahem!

40:40.685 --> 40:44.054
Perhaps Mr. Edison Junior
would be willing to not use

40:44.089 --> 40:47.191
the family name in business in exchange

40:47.225 --> 40:50.694
- for a monthly stipend.
- That might be acceptable.

40:50.728 --> 40:53.697
- How healthy a stipend?
- I'll have the details

40:53.731 --> 40:56.132
drawn up. Good day, Detective.

41:00.838 --> 41:03.640
- I am sorry things couldn't end on...
- Now that I am no longer

41:03.674 --> 41:05.675
shackled to the Edison name,

41:05.710 --> 41:08.811
what do you think of Thomas Willard?

41:08.846 --> 41:12.281
That's a perfectly good name.

41:12.315 --> 41:14.951
Perhaps Burton Willard has more authority.

41:14.985 --> 41:17.553
- Also good.
- "Burton Willard."

41:17.587 --> 41:22.091
I can see that name
splashed across a billboard.

41:24.361 --> 41:27.563
What an odd pair the
Edisons turned out to be.

41:27.597 --> 41:30.932
Not what you'd expect a famous
father and son to be like at all.

41:30.967 --> 41:33.602
There's no telling, is
there. You never really know

41:33.637 --> 41:36.639
- what the private lives of public figures are like.
- I suppose not.

41:36.673 --> 41:39.074
Who knows, maybe young Edison
will end up on a career path

41:39.108 --> 41:41.342
that doesn't step on his
father's. Maybe he'll be a...

41:41.377 --> 41:43.711
beekeeper or something.

41:43.746 --> 41:47.515
Well, from what you describe, it doesn't seem
as though he'll succeed at much of anything.

41:47.549 --> 41:50.085
Oh, I just want to step
in here for a moment.

41:50.119 --> 41:52.120
- You two go on.
- Alright.

41:54.991 --> 41:58.493
Do you think Mr. Edison
Junior will miss his father?

41:58.527 --> 42:00.495
I suspect he might, you know.

42:00.529 --> 42:02.797
Who knows, maybe the two will mellow out

42:02.831 --> 42:05.300
over the next few years.

42:06.034 --> 42:08.636
I would miss my father.

42:08.671 --> 42:11.939
I already miss him a lot.

42:11.973 --> 42:14.842
Why do you think my mom won't tell
me that he's never coming back?

42:16.812 --> 42:18.779
What do you mean?

42:18.814 --> 42:22.482
She got a letter a couple
months ago that made her cry.

42:22.517 --> 42:24.118
Did you read it?

42:24.152 --> 42:27.087
I know my father's dead.

42:30.157 --> 42:33.660
- She just won't say anything.
- Well, that's a very difficult thing

42:33.695 --> 42:36.129
to tell a son, Simon.

42:36.163 --> 42:38.565
You should tell her that you know already.

42:38.599 --> 42:42.336
- You think?
- I do. I think she would be relieved.

42:42.370 --> 42:45.271
I think you might feel relieved.

42:45.306 --> 42:49.008
Yeah. I should tell her.

42:51.345 --> 42:53.880
Do you want to...

42:53.914 --> 42:56.716
I don't know, do you want
to give this thing a whack?

42:56.750 --> 42:59.518
- Yeah.
- Here you are.

42:59.553 --> 43:02.921
Give it a good one, now.

43:02.956 --> 43:05.524
Oh, very nice!

43:05.559 --> 43:08.060
- Very good!
- That was so close.

43:09.261 --> 43:11.929
- Yeah.
- Oh, I don't know. I've got a...

43:11.964 --> 43:13.931
sore elbow, you see, I don't...

43:17.403 --> 43:19.471
- Who knew!
- I can't believe it!

43:19.503 --> 43:21.239
All-new Murdoch.

43:26.294 --> 43:28.828
A moment of silence for Mr. Grady.

43:30.131 --> 43:32.331
Everybody hated him.

43:32.333 --> 43:33.332
To you!

43:33.334 --> 43:34.566
Murdoch Mysteries,

43:34.568 --> 43:36.568
