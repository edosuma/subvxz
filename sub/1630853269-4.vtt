00:00.640 --> 00:03.880
'The following programme
contains strong language.'

00:12.280 --> 00:15.800
They say you were murdered.
There's so much I don't remember.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.000
I can't figure out
what happened on my own.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.200
I can't figure out
what happened on my own.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.400
About last night...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.640
We're all handling this
in our own way.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.000
I don't want to fall out.
Me either.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.560
I don't want to fall out.
Me either.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.640
And did you take GHB last night?

00:30.680 --> 00:32.000
No.

00:32.000 --> 00:32.440
No.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.560
Joe didn't kill Neve.
He was with me.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.000
They're releasing Joe.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.760
They're releasing Joe.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.200
Why?

00:43.240 --> 00:45.480
There's something in the woods.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.600
'Mum, stop texting.
I'm fine.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.080
I'm at the party.
I'll see you in the morning.'

01:11.120 --> 01:12.000
'To replay your message, press...'

01:12.000 --> 01:13.080
'To replay your message, press...'

01:13.120 --> 01:15.000
'Mum, stop texting. I'm fine.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.480
I'm at the party.
I'll see you in the morning.'

01:58.840 --> 02:00.000
What the hell is this place?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.160
What the hell is this place?

02:17.480 --> 02:20.080
there's no better days

02:23.880 --> 02:24.000
until I'm scared of day

02:24.000 --> 02:27.240
until I'm scared of day

02:42.600 --> 02:44.680
'Mum, stop texting. I'm fine.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.320
I'm at the party.
I'll see you in the morning.'

02:47.360 --> 02:48.000
'To replay your message, press one.'

02:48.000 --> 02:50.120
'To replay your message, press one.'

02:50.960 --> 02:52.960
'Mum, stop texting. I'm fine.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.120
I'm at the party.
I'll see you in the morning.'

02:55.160 --> 02:56.000
Hey, love.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.600
Hey, love.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.440
Katie's not in her room.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.360
Did you...kick her out?

03:01.400 --> 03:04.000
She probably just stayed over
at your nan's.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.200
She probably just stayed over
at your nan's.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.320
Is that Joe's stuff?

03:07.360 --> 03:10.040
I just want it out of the house.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.000
I've been thinking about
what Tom said the other night.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.000
That...Neve's still here.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.160
That...Neve's still here.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.480
Max, Tom's grieving.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.000
He can't see Neve.
He just...really wants to.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.280
He can't see Neve.
He just...really wants to.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.680
But...I think he's right.

03:36.600 --> 03:40.920
I get a weird feeling sometimes,
like...she's here.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.000
It's normal.
You're just missing her.

03:44.000 --> 03:44.520
It's normal.
You're just missing her.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.640
I'd give anything to have her back,
but it's not that.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.480
I can feel her in the room.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.320
Can you feel her here?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.920
Is she here now?

03:58.960 --> 04:00.000
No.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.840
No.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.160
I'm telling the truth.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.000
You won't feel like this forever.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.120
You won't feel like this forever.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.920
Sleep OK?
I didn't sleep at all.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.720
Yeah, me neither.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.240
I keep thinking about her.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.000
Sorry to just turn up like that.

04:32.000 --> 04:32.160
Sorry to just turn up like that.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.880
I didn't know where else to go.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.160
It's OK.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.880
What did they say?

04:41.920 --> 04:43.600
Your Dad and Maria?

04:44.800 --> 04:47.160
Maria just gave me
the silent treatment.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.000
Would've been easier
if she'd screamed or yelled

04:48.000 --> 04:49.600
Would've been easier
if she'd screamed or yelled

04:49.640 --> 04:52.080
but no-one did that.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.680
Dad just looked disappointed.
He said I'd let everyone down.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.720
I'm sorry for how I acted yesterday.

05:03.920 --> 05:04.000
I was scared.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.840
I was scared.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.840
But I took it out on you
and I shouldn't have done that.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.000
You didn't have to put yourself
through that.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.080
You didn't have to put yourself
through that.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.680
With the police and your family.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.480
I would've protected you.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.920
It's done now.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.000
And what happened between us...

05:28.000 --> 05:29.280
And what happened between us...

05:29.320 --> 05:31.040
it was a mistake...

05:31.880 --> 05:33.840
..a one-time thing.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.000
There was nothing in it, right?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.280
There was nothing in it, right?

05:39.480 --> 05:41.120
You're not good enough for me,

05:41.160 --> 05:43.880
and you definitely weren't
good enough for Neve.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.640
Think she'd forgive us?

05:53.080 --> 05:55.080
I wouldn't.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.000
Last thing she did for me was wrap
that jacket round me cos I was cold.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.120
Last thing she did for me was wrap
that jacket round me cos I was cold.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.480
She was always looking out for me.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.480
They'll catch whoever killed her.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.000
Even if I have to do it myself.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.240
Even if I have to do it myself.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.880
'Hey, it's Katie.
Just leave a message or text me.'

06:28.920 --> 06:30.560
She's not answering.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.000
She's lucky
I haven't changed the locks.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.360
She's lucky
I haven't changed the locks.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.200
Don't be like that.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.000
What should I be like, then?

06:43.360 --> 06:46.000
'Hey, it's Katie.
Just leave a message or text me.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.560
Bye.'

06:56.560 --> 06:58.280
Morning.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.760
You sleep OK?

07:05.280 --> 07:08.160
Better, yeah. You?

07:08.200 --> 07:10.440
I don't sleep.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.000
I lie there, I close my eyes.
But I never sleep.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.560
I lie there, I close my eyes.
But I never sleep.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.000
That's horrible.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.440
That's horrible.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.720
How's your family?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.000
Katie left
as soon as they all got home.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Katie left
as soon as they all got home.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.960
Don't know where she went.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.000
Don't care.
Yeah, you do.

07:36.000 --> 07:36.760
Don't care.
Yeah, you do.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.760
Soon as the sun was up,
I went to the woods.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.040
And?
Nothing.

07:44.560 --> 07:49.960
It's like...whatever's there,
it's playing with my head.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.080
I've felt it before so why not now,
when I want to?

07:55.120 --> 07:57.640
It's gonna be OK.
It's not, cos I need to know.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.680
Just breathe.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.960
You're cold.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.400
Same as yesterday.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.680
I like the cold.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.840
Neve, all this trauma
you've been through...

08:24.920 --> 08:26.920
..I think...

08:27.720 --> 08:29.800
..you need to deal with it.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.000
After the crash,
I avoided talking about it -

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
After the crash,
I avoided talking about it -

08:34.040 --> 08:36.560
and Joe did, too -
and that's why things are...

08:38.400 --> 08:40.000
..how they are.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.360
..how they are.

08:40.400 --> 08:45.720
You helped me start to confront it,
and I want to be the same for you.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.320
All I'm saying is â€”
I'm here if you want to talk.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.880
I wanna talk about those woods.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.480
You were up early.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.560
What's she doing?

09:17.560 --> 09:19.560
I don't know.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.880
Thanks.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.000
Where have you been?

09:52.000 --> 09:52.200
Where have you been?

09:52.240 --> 09:54.160
I was worried.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.680
I'm fine.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.160
Katie, you can't ignore my calls
and messages like that.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.680
Where were you last night?
Joseph's!

10:05.400 --> 10:07.760
Are you gonna talk to me?

10:07.800 --> 10:08.000
Well, say something!

10:08.000 --> 10:09.640
Well, say something!

10:09.680 --> 10:12.360
OK, let's all just calm down.
I'm sorry, OK?

10:12.400 --> 10:15.520
I made a stupid mistake.
But Neve dumped Joseph that night.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.000
He was upset, I was drunk.
I swear it only happened once.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.080
He was upset, I was drunk.
I swear it only happened once.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.200
Neve finished with him,
so you stepped in?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.480
Isn't that what you did with Dad
when Mum was out of the way?

10:22.520 --> 10:24.000
Katie. Hey, she didn't mean it.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.760
Katie. Hey, she didn't mean it.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.000
I've been having the same dream
the past few nights.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.160
I've been having the same dream
the past few nights.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.240
I'm watching them pull Neve
out of the lake,

10:36.280 --> 10:39.000
over and over on a loop.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.520
Last night, I had the same dream.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.480
Only it was your body
they dragged out.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.960
And it was the best night's sleep
I've had in days.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.920
Jesus Christ.

10:55.960 --> 10:56.000
Katie...

10:56.000 --> 10:57.960
Katie...

11:14.840 --> 11:16.840
Hi, Tom.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.840
Hey, mate.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.480
Um...

11:21.520 --> 11:23.440
Can I get a lift to school?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.840
Tom, I don't think
you'll be going back today.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.000
I'm fine.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.840
I'm fine.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.680
You're not, though.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.160
You can't be at school, Tom.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.400
What am I supposed to do?

11:36.440 --> 11:39.080
Sit at home, staring at the walls?

11:41.640 --> 11:43.200
I-I want to teach.

11:43.960 --> 11:44.000
And those kids need me.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.040
And those kids need me.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.600
Not like this, they don't.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.000
All right...

11:56.840 --> 11:58.600
I'll walk.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.000
You're drunk, Tom. I can't have you
around the kids in this state.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.200
You're drunk, Tom. I can't have you
around the kids in this state.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.160
Let me do my job.
No, Tom, listen.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.240
Get the fuck off me!

12:09.520 --> 12:11.440
Tom, you all right?

12:44.560 --> 12:46.200
Hey.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.640
I can't even paint.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.000
So I spoke to Katie.

12:56.000 --> 12:56.560
So I spoke to Katie.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.760
She's pretty upset.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.000
What do you expect me to do?

13:04.000 --> 13:04.720
What do you expect me to do?

13:04.760 --> 13:06.360
Apologise?

13:06.400 --> 13:08.200
She's just a kid.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.040
She's 18.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.000
Think of the stupid things
you did at that age.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.480
Think of the stupid things
you did at that age.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.240
Well, I certainly didn't fuck
my step-sister's boyfriend.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.000
She just needs
a bit of understanding.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.440
You're not the only one
grieving here, Maria. We are, too.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.560
And I'm trying as hard as I can
to hold this family together,

13:26.600 --> 13:28.000
but I can't do it on my own.
I can't think about you right now.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.520
but I can't do it on my own.
I can't think about you right now.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.640
If that makes me selfish, then I'm
sorry but that's just how it is.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.320
We have responsibilities.
I can't be in this house any more.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.000
And what's that supposed to mean?
I just can't do this.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.840
And what's that supposed to mean?
I just can't do this.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.160
You, Katie, Joan, all of it!

13:41.200 --> 13:44.000
And all I can think about is Neve!

13:44.000 --> 13:44.360
And all I can think about is Neve!

13:47.640 --> 13:49.600
Just tell me what to do.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.400
I don't know.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.000
I need to leave.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.120
I need to leave.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.040
Yeah, but you're coming back,
though?

14:03.080 --> 14:04.600
Maria!

14:06.400 --> 14:08.000
We're focusing on the belt
that was used to strangle Neve.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.800
We're focusing on the belt
that was used to strangle Neve.

14:09.840 --> 14:13.080
There's a slight indentation
from a pattern on the buckle
on Neve's neck.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.120
It's a distinctive design.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.000
So we're going through
social media from the party

14:16.000 --> 14:17.600
So we're going through
social media from the party

14:17.640 --> 14:20.080
and trying to match the buckle
to anyone who was there.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.160
That's not gonna show up
on the photos taken at night.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.000
It's worth a shot.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.240
It's worth a shot.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.800
Everything all right?

14:29.760 --> 14:32.000
Do you know anything about
strange rock piles in the woods?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.280
Do you know anything about
strange rock piles in the woods?

14:34.320 --> 14:36.640
Oh, they're probably
old camp sites. Why?

14:36.680 --> 14:39.240
I dunno, I just saw them.
I'm interested.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.000
It's an old Halloween thing.
Or Beltane. Or something.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.160
It's an old Halloween thing.
Or Beltane. Or something.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.680
Lighting bonfires
to pay tribute to Hettie...

14:46.720 --> 14:48.000
communicate with her.
Her husband owned Keaton Hall.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.520
communicate with her.
Her husband owned Keaton Hall.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.000
Hettie Keaton.
It's all nonsense.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.480
That is kind of crazy.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.000
No more crazy than
everything else that's happened.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.080
No more crazy than
everything else that's happened.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.480
It's just a fairy tale.
Based on a real woman, though.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.000
Maybe she just wants to be heard.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.800
Maybe she just wants to be heard.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.960
She didn't get to say
what really happened to her.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.760
I have to try to contact her.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.760
What if she's...like me?

15:30.560 --> 15:32.160
So...

15:32.960 --> 15:35.320
Katie Sands.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.000
You guys a thing?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.720
You guys a thing?

15:37.760 --> 15:39.760
I wouldn't care if you were.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.200
Don't take advantage.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.640
You lecturing me?

15:47.440 --> 15:50.320
You've been a proper dick,
so, yeah, I am.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.840
I was out of order.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.280
Just forget what I said.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.520
Everything's such a mess.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.000
Now everyone thinks I'm a murderer.
No, they don't.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.640
Now everyone thinks I'm a murderer.
No, they don't.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.800
Then where is everybody?
No-one knows what to say.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.800
Just give it time.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.000
That someone's bike out there?

16:16.000 --> 16:16.760
That someone's bike out there?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.840
Yeah. Why?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.880
Shit.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.760
It's been cut.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.040
Which one of you was it?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.760
Was it you?

16:44.320 --> 16:45.840
Was what me?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.560
Now, come on, be a fucking man.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.000
If you've got something to say,
say it to my face.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.280
If you've got something to say,
say it to my face.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.000
What was she like?

16:56.000 --> 16:56.360
What was she like?

16:56.400 --> 16:58.200
Huh?

16:58.240 --> 17:00.040
Katie Sands.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.560
Out of ten.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.000
Better or worse than Neve?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.480
Better or worse than Neve?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.280
Have you had Maria?

17:07.320 --> 17:10.760
Cos I'd totally go there. She's fit.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.000
Hey, how about old Joan?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.040
Hey, how about old Joan?

17:13.080 --> 17:15.960
Maybe you and your boyfriend
can have a gangbang with Daniel

17:16.000 --> 17:17.640
while you're at it.
Come on!

17:17.680 --> 17:19.040
Enough!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.560
Back off, Joe!

17:25.240 --> 17:26.800
Joseph.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.400
What the hell
are you lot playing at?

17:31.440 --> 17:34.000
Turning on each other like this?
It's shameful.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.000
How many times
have I bailed you lot out?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.360
How many times
have I bailed you lot out?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.760
Sat with you in court?
Sorted work for you?

17:39.800 --> 17:43.080
Lent you money â€” no questions asked?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.000
This club isn't just about motocross
and getting pissed with your mates.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.240
This club isn't just about motocross
and getting pissed with your mates.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.320
It's about loyalty.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.280
It's about trust.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.000
It's about having
each other's backs.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.920
It's about having
each other's backs.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.160
No matter what's happened,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.400
turning on your brothers
isn't the answer.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.000
We need to stick together.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.960
We need to stick together.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.880
Right?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Right?

18:08.000 --> 18:08.880
Right?

18:25.040 --> 18:27.760
You know how ridiculous this is?

18:27.800 --> 18:29.320
You got a better idea?

18:36.840 --> 18:38.240
Now what?

18:38.280 --> 18:40.000
The matches.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.480
The matches.

18:42.880 --> 18:47.440
Is there a...witchy spell
we need to say before I light this?

18:49.800 --> 18:52.560
Shall I do a little dance?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.040
Little witchy dance?

18:55.080 --> 18:56.000
Would you stop doing that, please?
Why, is it exciting you?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.160
Would you stop doing that, please?
Why, is it exciting you?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.760
Not at all.
Do you feel all witchy?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.760
No.
How about now?!

19:02.800 --> 19:04.000
No.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.640
No.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.960
Now?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.480
No!

19:10.720 --> 19:12.000
Now?

19:12.000 --> 19:12.400
Now?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.920
Maybe a little.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.760
Did you hear that?

19:33.360 --> 19:35.360
It's gone.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.440
Ahh!

19:48.480 --> 19:50.360
Alex?

20:49.960 --> 20:52.040
Go home.

21:03.960 --> 21:04.000
'Neve?!'

21:04.000 --> 21:05.040
'Neve?!'

21:06.760 --> 21:09.000
Oh, my God! Are you OK? Neve!

21:09.040 --> 21:11.880
Yeah, I'm here.
What the fuck was that?

21:12.680 --> 21:15.880
We need to get out of here.
Wait, wait, wait.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.960
I was in a reception area, a hotel.
What?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I was taken there.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.120
I was taken there.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.480
Like someone wanted me to see it,
like it was important.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.000
What hotel?

21:25.840 --> 21:28.000
There was a Persian carpet,
a chandelier in the lobby,

21:28.000 --> 21:28.920
There was a Persian carpet,
a chandelier in the lobby,

21:28.960 --> 21:31.640
a bedroom with number 7 on the door,
red walls.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.600
That sounds like Keaton Hall.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.680
I think I'm meant to go there.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.400
Hey.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.720
You OK?

23:14.120 --> 23:16.400
OK. Thanks, Nicky.
I'll be right there.

23:16.440 --> 23:19.280
Maria's at the cafe.
Nicky's worried.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.000
I'm gonna go get her.
Wait. Let me speak to her.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.160
I'm gonna go get her.
Wait. Let me speak to her.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.960
No, we need to sort this out.
Katie's still upset.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.720
And Max isn't much better.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.000
They need you here.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.280
They need you here.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.320
Yeah, and I need Maria.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.800
Charging in there
might make things worse.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.680
Let me sound her out, eh?

23:34.720 --> 23:36.000
I'll talk to her â€” mother to mother.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.600
I'll talk to her â€” mother to mother.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.240
Go be with your kids.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.560
I'll do my best with Maria.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.360
Just bring her home.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.360
Mmm.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.000
Hi.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.240
Hi.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.040
Ah... Wrong room.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.000
Sorry, bro.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.560
Sorry, bro.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.000
You don't know what you're missing.
They've got Jammie Dodgers in there.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.880
You don't know what you're missing.
They've got Jammie Dodgers in there.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.160
They're a pretty decent bunch,
you know?

25:18.200 --> 25:20.000
Makes it less scary to talk.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.520
Makes it less scary to talk.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.560
Listen, if this is your thing, then
great, but I don't think it's mine.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.000
So, what are you gonna do now?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.600
So, what are you gonna do now?

25:29.640 --> 25:31.800
To be honest with you, mate...

25:32.640 --> 25:34.920
..I think I'm gonna get pissed.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.440
Tom, hang on.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.280
I'm not gonna make you
go in there but...

25:43.320 --> 25:44.000
at least stay for a brew.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.680
at least stay for a brew.

26:11.120 --> 26:14.960
People used to say they couldn't
understand what I was going through.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.560
And they were right. How could they?

26:21.440 --> 26:23.960
Unless they'd lost someone.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.280
Victoria was my only daughter.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.160
She was everything to me.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
And then she was gone.

26:32.920 --> 26:38.040
Police thought...she took her own
life, but they never found a body.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.000
No funeral, no closure.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.120
No funeral, no closure.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.120
Just questions.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.880
An ache...

26:49.240 --> 26:51.440
..right here.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.440
Never went away.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.000
Your heart's broken.

26:56.000 --> 26:56.360
Your heart's broken.

26:57.560 --> 27:03.560
It'll never be fixed.
It'll never beat the way it used to.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.200
There'll be times
when you wake up and...

27:10.880 --> 27:12.000
..expect to see her...

27:12.000 --> 27:12.720
..expect to see her...

27:12.760 --> 27:15.120
and it'll take a good few seconds...

27:16.080 --> 27:18.080
..for you to remember...

27:19.400 --> 27:20.000
..that she's gone.

27:20.000 --> 27:20.880
..that she's gone.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.840
You start to forget
the smell of her.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.000
Years will pass
and you'll find yourself crying

27:28.000 --> 27:30.120
Years will pass
and you'll find yourself crying

27:30.160 --> 27:33.000
or feeling angry or sad...

27:34.120 --> 27:36.000
..for no reason.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.120
..for no reason.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.520
But the reason is always her.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.920
I want you to know what's coming.

27:51.760 --> 27:52.000
I want you to know
that I got through it

27:52.000 --> 27:54.200
I want you to know
that I got through it

27:54.240 --> 27:56.160
because I had Daniel...

27:56.880 --> 27:58.480
..and the grandkids.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.520
Whatever's happened...

28:06.720 --> 28:08.000
..don't push them away.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.880
..don't push them away.

28:28.160 --> 28:32.000
The whole place felt cold and empty,
like I was the only person there.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.520
The whole place felt cold and empty,
like I was the only person there.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.720
This is seriously messed up.

28:37.760 --> 28:40.000
We should be getting out of here,
not walking all the way to the Hall.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.280
We should be getting out of here,
not walking all the way to the Hall.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.000
Are you even listening to me?
Sorry, what?

28:48.000 --> 28:48.480
Are you even listening to me?
Sorry, what?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.880
Did it happen again?

28:52.920 --> 28:55.440
Did you go somewhere else?

28:55.480 --> 28:56.000
No.
So what's the matter?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.120
No.
So what's the matter?

28:57.160 --> 28:59.920
You're right.
It's not safe out here.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.920
I think I should go on my own.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.000
No, I want us both
to get out of here.

29:04.000 --> 29:04.760
No, I want us both
to get out of here.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.320
Whatever's happening,
it's dangerous.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.760
I can feel it. It's like...

29:11.120 --> 29:12.000
..angry.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.800
..angry.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.800
I feel like the woods are angry.
You're not making any sense.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.000
I just want you safe.

29:20.000 --> 29:20.480
I just want you safe.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.560
This thing is powerful.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.240
We don't know what it is
or what it's capable of.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.440
And if it's at the Hall...

29:30.120 --> 29:32.960
I'm not taking you with me.
Who says you get a choice?

29:38.600 --> 29:40.440
One hour.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.680
Then I'll come looking.

29:42.720 --> 29:43.960
Sure.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.920
Go home.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.760
I'm not judging.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.000
But one turns into three,
turns into five...

30:16.000 --> 30:17.440
But one turns into three,
turns into five...

30:18.240 --> 30:20.280
..turns into you hating yourself.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.400
And then the cycle repeats.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.480
I'm not perfect, either.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.080
I still mess up.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.000
I still let people down.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.240
I still let people down.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.200
William gives you a hard time.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.880
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.

30:47.480 --> 30:48.000
When Joe's mum died, I fell apart.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.480
When Joe's mum died, I fell apart.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.960
That's when
I really started drinking.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.840
He pulled me out of
a really dark place.

30:55.880 --> 30:56.000
He was hard on me...
but that's what I needed.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.440
He was hard on me...
but that's what I needed.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.000
I'm sorry.

31:04.000 --> 31:04.440
I'm sorry.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.000
We've all lost.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.840
We all try and cope in our own way.

31:13.480 --> 31:16.600
He's a big softie, deep down.
I reckon I owe him.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.400
I just hope I haven't
messed Joe around too much.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.480
I see the way he looks at me
sometimes, like...

31:29.640 --> 31:31.560
..I'm not enough...

31:31.600 --> 31:33.120
and it kills me.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.000
Messing up my kid was my speciality.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Messing up my kid was my speciality.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.880
And the ex-wife...

31:43.600 --> 31:44.000
Probably done
some lifelong damage there, too.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.200
Probably done
some lifelong damage there, too.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.720
You could still
make it right with Maria.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.000
She's moved on.

31:52.000 --> 31:52.200
She's moved on.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.280
You haven't?

31:55.320 --> 31:57.720
I see her with Daniel and I think...

31:57.760 --> 31:59.320
"Is that what you wanted...

31:59.360 --> 32:00.000
a man with money and a nice house?"

32:00.000 --> 32:02.080
a man with money and a nice house?"

32:04.480 --> 32:06.480
"Is that what life's really about?"

32:11.720 --> 32:15.360
You think you can make her happy
again with a bottle in your hand?

32:34.640 --> 32:36.440
So where is she?

32:37.240 --> 32:38.960
She'll be back.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.240
When?

32:42.280 --> 32:44.360
She just needed some space.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.600
I knew I should've gone.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.760
Trust me.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.960
You need to stay strong
for those kids.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Cos it's always me
that has to pick up the pieces.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.840
Cos it's always me
that has to pick up the pieces.

32:56.880 --> 33:01.200
It's always me that has to carry on
while everyone else falls apart.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.000
Dan, Maria's not like Victoria.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.400
Dan, Maria's not like Victoria.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.240
It's not going to happen again.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.400
I don't want to talk any more.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.240
I need to fix dinner.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.000
Double vodka.

33:20.000 --> 33:20.520
Double vodka.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.120
Coming up.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.720
Hey.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.000
Not now, Joe.

33:36.000 --> 33:36.680
Not now, Joe.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.080
I just want to say...

33:40.120 --> 33:42.760
I don't blame you
for going to the police.

33:43.640 --> 33:44.000
I probably would've done the same.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I probably would've done the same.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.200
OK.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.440
Are you OK?

33:57.240 --> 33:58.960
Not really.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.560
Where have you been?

34:02.600 --> 34:04.440
The woods.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.920
Were you with someone?

34:09.200 --> 34:11.000
Did something happen?

34:11.040 --> 34:12.960
I don't want to talk about it.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.080
Can I get another one?
Sure.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.000
Alex, what's in the woods?
Something bad.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.360
Alex, what's in the woods?
Something bad.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.040
What do you mean?

34:20.080 --> 34:23.760
I don't want to talk.
I just want to drink. OK?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.680
You should take it easy.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.000
Last thing I need right now
is a lecture.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Last thing I need right now
is a lecture.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.800
Oh, all right. Look, I didn't
mean it like that, OK?

34:44.840 --> 34:46.760
I'm just worried about you.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.440
Everything all right?

34:53.920 --> 34:56.000
Has anything bad
ever happened at Keaton Hall?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.120
Has anything bad
ever happened at Keaton Hall?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.760
What do you mean?
Has it?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.000
I don't know. Why are you asking?

35:04.000 --> 35:05.680
I don't know. Why are you asking?

35:07.040 --> 35:09.080
Just curious.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.000
Alex, what are you not telling me?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.480
Alex, what are you not telling me?

35:19.480 --> 35:20.000
Hey.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.160
Hey.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.880
I've been thinking
we should talk more.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.360
I know I haven't said this,
but I'm proud of you.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.000
It can't be easy coming back here,
facing up to what happened.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.520
It can't be easy coming back here,
facing up to what happened.

35:40.080 --> 35:44.000
I just want you to know
that you can come to me any time.

35:46.040 --> 35:49.040
I'm just taking an interest
in local history.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.240
That's all.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.000
I want you to tell me about Neve.

39:28.000 --> 39:28.800
I want you to tell me about Neve.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.000
What do you want?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.320
What do you want?

41:15.080 --> 41:17.280
Just tell me!

41:39.240 --> 41:41.240
Neve.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.000
You can see me.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.320
You can see me.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.560
I think this is where I died.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.200
You have to help me.
We have to call the police.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.680
Oh, shit.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.000
I'm sorry.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.440
I'm sorry.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.720
What did I ever do to you?

42:13.840 --> 42:15.240
Neve.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.600
Let me go!
Don't make this hard!

42:20.640 --> 42:23.720
Let me go! Argh!
Stop struggling!
