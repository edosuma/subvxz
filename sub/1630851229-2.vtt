09:10.792 --> 09:13.385

09:13.387 --> 09:14.794
Bradycardic, hypotensive.

09:14.796 --> 09:16.613
Well, a nurse told us
he might have been assaulted.

09:16.615 --> 09:17.447
Was there head trauma?

09:17.449 --> 09:18.965
Bruising and lacerations,

09:18.967 --> 09:20.541
but I'm reserving judgment

09:20.543 --> 09:22.043
until that CT comes up.

09:22.045 --> 09:24.120
If he was assaulted
in our hospital,

09:24.122 --> 09:25.564
I have to call the police.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.357
Scans are coming up now.

09:28.310 --> 09:30.960
Well, that's a normal
head CT.

09:30.962 --> 09:32.796
No evidence of stroke
or bleed.

09:32.798 --> 09:35.648
Which rules out brain injury
as the primary issue.

09:35.650 --> 09:38.225
I don't think he was assaulted.

09:38.227 --> 09:40.653
Look at his lungs.

09:40.655 --> 09:43.973
-Bilateral infiltrates.
-BELL: You know, he could have
aspirated when he was down,

09:43.975 --> 09:45.750
and that would explain
the hypoxemia.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.462
He might have, but that wouldn't
explain the seizure.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.591
I just don't know.

09:58.414 --> 10:00.323
Let's review the differential.

10:00.325 --> 10:01.991
KIT:
We ruled out brain bleed.

10:01.993 --> 10:03.602
-BELL: And stroke.
-What about an arrhythmia?

10:03.604 --> 10:05.495
Maybe it made him pass out
and hit his head.

10:05.497 --> 10:07.497
It's possible,
but his EKG was normal.

10:07.499 --> 10:09.608
Nothing strange on telemetry.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.000
Are his labs back?

10:11.002 --> 10:14.112
Uh, his potassium and magnesium
are okay.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.263
His urine tox was negative,

10:16.265 --> 10:18.191
but his lactate is sky-high.

10:18.193 --> 10:19.525
He's got profound
metabolic acidosis.

10:19.527 --> 10:21.694
No, he's septic?
That makes no sense.

10:21.696 --> 10:24.438
White count's normal, his
abdominal scan was benign.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.606
No, it doesn't read
like an infection.

10:25.608 --> 10:27.083
Must be something else.

10:28.277 --> 10:30.128
Look at his watch.

10:31.039 --> 10:32.631
His dad gave it to him,

10:32.633 --> 10:35.208
but it was silver
and now it's black.

10:35.210 --> 10:37.469
-It's tarnished.
-(gagging)

10:37.471 --> 10:39.763
It's blood.

10:41.199 --> 10:43.058
CONRAD:
A tarnished watch.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.536
Frothy, blood-tinged secretions.

10:46.538 --> 10:49.481
It's a chemical reaction.
His airways are involved.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.133
And whatever it is crossed
the blood-brain barrier.

10:52.135 --> 10:53.467
That's why he seized.

10:53.469 --> 10:55.728
And if it's in his airway,
chances are...

10:55.730 --> 10:58.882
It's a gas.
But which one?

10:58.884 --> 11:01.976
-Carbon monoxide doesn't fit.
-Yeah, but hydrogen sulfide
would.

11:01.978 --> 11:05.889
Okay. Yes, that's a possibility.
We'll keep him on oxygen,

11:05.891 --> 11:08.858
bolus fluids and give him the
antidotes to hydrogen sulfide.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.627
Leela.

11:13.581 --> 11:15.173
We're getting there.

11:20.496 --> 11:23.664
Something poisoned him
at Chastain.

11:23.666 --> 11:24.832
If it was hydrogen sulfide,

11:24.834 --> 11:26.426
then there is an imminent threat

11:26.428 --> 11:28.687
-to patients and staff.
-Yeah, I know, I agree.

11:28.689 --> 11:32.506
You stay, and I'll cover for you
with Browner and the board.

11:32.508 --> 11:33.583
Are you sure?

11:33.585 --> 11:37.529
I know all about
wooing arrogant doctors.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.589
I won't blow it.

11:39.591 --> 11:41.658
Thanks.

11:44.854 --> 11:47.688
AUSTIN:
So I see you've had an
aortic valve replacement.

11:48.767 --> 11:51.267
Your scar here in the
ultrasound tells the tale.

11:51.269 --> 11:53.286
-What does that mean?
-Well, it means

11:53.288 --> 11:55.455
your friend needed surgery
to replace the valve

11:55.457 --> 11:58.049
that allows the blood
to exit the heart.

12:01.963 --> 12:04.055
Sophomore year.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.115
I thought I had the flu.

12:06.117 --> 12:07.951
I... I'd been partying.

12:07.953 --> 12:09.561
A lot.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.480
And I collapsed in my dorm.

12:13.382 --> 12:15.216
When I woke up in the hospital,

12:15.218 --> 12:17.694
they told me I had
an infection in my heart.

12:18.888 --> 12:21.147
Well, now the new valve
is infected,

12:21.149 --> 12:22.465
which is why you have a fever.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.801
And I'm guessing the source is

12:24.803 --> 12:27.653
recent IV drug use.

12:27.655 --> 12:30.749
(short chuckle)
You told me no more dope.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.492
IRVING:
Junkie broke a promise.

12:32.494 --> 12:34.669
I'm shocked.

12:36.815 --> 12:38.256
I'm gonna go check on Devon.

12:41.577 --> 12:45.430
My head's pounding.
Can we move on?

12:45.432 --> 12:48.767
Sure.
You see that bright spot

12:48.769 --> 12:50.176
on your heart?

12:50.178 --> 12:51.677
It's called vegetation.

12:51.679 --> 12:55.348
It means there's a mess
of germs and clot on your valve.

12:55.350 --> 12:58.926
And these infections travel fast
in the bloodstream.

12:58.928 --> 13:00.686
And given that you have
a headache,

13:00.688 --> 13:04.282
my guess is your heart
is not the only thing in danger.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.202
So I'm going to page
a neuro consult.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.235
How's he doing?

13:16.237 --> 13:18.213
CONRAD:
He's on oxygen and fluids.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.691
We gave him
the potential antidotes.

13:21.693 --> 13:23.718
Fingers crossed they work.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.097
(groaning)

13:32.554 --> 13:34.312
He's waking up.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.814
Devon?

13:35.816 --> 13:37.607
Can you hear me?

13:41.470 --> 13:43.196
Can you hear me?

14:03.585 --> 14:05.492
W-Where am I?

14:05.494 --> 14:07.494
(exhales)
Oh, my God.

14:07.496 --> 14:09.496
You're at Chastain.

14:09.498 --> 14:12.225
You're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

14:13.595 --> 14:15.595
Did I almost die?

14:15.597 --> 14:18.189
Definitely almost died.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.507
Welcome back, brother.

14:20.509 --> 14:21.934
How do you feel?

14:21.936 --> 14:24.937
Like I drank a bottle of gin.

14:24.939 --> 14:26.847
Three bottles.

14:26.849 --> 14:31.578
-It really, really hurts
to breathe.
-(pager buzzing)

14:33.932 --> 14:36.190
I got to go.

14:36.192 --> 14:38.192
You scared us.

14:38.194 --> 14:40.295
Hang in there.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.456
What happened?

14:43.458 --> 14:46.342
Do you remember anything
from yesterday?

14:47.445 --> 14:49.554
Nothing.

14:51.116 --> 14:53.116
LEELA:
That's okay.

14:53.118 --> 14:54.967
It'll come to you.

14:54.969 --> 14:56.895
-(coughing)
-Okay.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.122
Just take it easy.

14:59.124 --> 15:02.942
-(Devon breathing heavily)
-(sighs)

15:03.570 --> 15:05.478
We'll figure it out.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.463
Get some rest.

15:07.465 --> 15:10.516
If your breathing gets worse,
you tell me right away.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.984
He can tell me.

15:11.986 --> 15:13.244
I'm not leaving his side

15:13.246 --> 15:15.154
until he walks
out of this hospital.

15:15.156 --> 15:17.290
Probably not after that, either.

15:32.081 --> 15:34.057
You called a neuro consult?

15:34.842 --> 15:35.992
Yeah.

15:35.994 --> 15:38.269
Yeah, the patient
is Janey Moore.

15:38.271 --> 15:42.190
Prosthetic aortic valve
endocarditis with headache.

15:43.501 --> 15:45.109
Excuse me.

15:48.189 --> 15:50.431
Any trouble with your eyesight?

15:50.433 --> 15:51.524
Double vision?

15:51.526 --> 15:53.509
If I study all night.

15:53.511 --> 15:55.161
Follow my finger.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.200
Tell me about the headache.

16:01.202 --> 16:03.019
Just a migraine, I think.

16:03.021 --> 16:06.280
-No big.
-You've had one every day
this past week.

16:06.282 --> 16:08.132
(flashlight clicks)

16:10.361 --> 16:11.861
BILLIE:
Exam suggests

16:11.863 --> 16:13.454
a possible sixth nerve palsy.

16:13.456 --> 16:15.214
She'll need a CT angiogram
of her head and neck

16:15.216 --> 16:16.457
to rule out stroke, aneurysm

16:16.459 --> 16:18.643
or abscess
related to the infection.

16:20.205 --> 16:22.146
Ms. Moore,
I'll see you in imaging.

16:30.548 --> 16:31.714
TREVOR:
Oh.

16:31.716 --> 16:33.716
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey. Hey.

16:33.718 --> 16:35.326
Is she gonna be okay?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.311
-I'll need to see her scans.
-Okay.

16:37.313 --> 16:38.329
But do you think
there's something wrong

16:38.331 --> 16:39.831
-with her brain?
-I don't know.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.092
I mean, she's a junkie,
so there's that.

16:44.062 --> 16:47.338
-What, is she your girlfriend?
-Not really.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.731
Well, if I were you,
I'd count my blessings

16:48.733 --> 16:50.508
-and move on.
-Oh, well, you don't know her.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.735
And I'm not taking
romantic advice from you.

16:52.737 --> 16:54.512
For obvious reasons.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.180
You don't know
what you're talking about.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.423
Oh. Well, you got that right.

16:57.425 --> 16:59.242
Because I don't know
where I come from.

16:59.244 --> 17:00.426
I don't know
why I am the way that I am.

17:00.428 --> 17:02.261
I thought
maybe you could explain

17:02.263 --> 17:04.505
-given the fact that you're...
-Excuse me.

17:04.507 --> 17:06.733
Bro, you want to...
you want to explain this?

17:09.437 --> 17:11.029
Oh.

17:11.939 --> 17:13.197
(Trevor scoffs)

17:13.199 --> 17:15.182
-Yeah, right.
-Wait a minute. Hold on.

17:15.184 --> 17:16.993
Where you going, bro?

17:18.687 --> 17:21.280
It's, uh, it's an entactogen.

17:21.282 --> 17:24.709
A dopamine agonist that bonds
to the serotonin receptors

17:24.711 --> 17:28.212
but with zero effect
on the GABA receptors.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.698
So it's a schematic for a drug

17:31.700 --> 17:33.292
that you created?

17:33.294 --> 17:35.444
TREVOR:
Yeah. It's recreational.

17:35.446 --> 17:36.796
For parties.

17:36.798 --> 17:39.282
You know, emotional connection.

17:39.284 --> 17:41.375
Bring people
out of their shells.

17:41.377 --> 17:43.377
And if I'd known she was using,

17:43.379 --> 17:45.304
I would've synthesized
a Suboxone equivalent,

17:45.306 --> 17:48.307
-given her that instead.
-Hang on, how do you know
how to do all this?

17:48.309 --> 17:50.459
I'm a medicinal chemistry major.

17:50.461 --> 17:54.130
I formulated the drug
so she wouldn't get too high.

17:54.132 --> 17:55.631
It's totally safe.

17:55.633 --> 17:57.483
You can clutch your pearls,
act all outraged.

17:57.485 --> 17:59.393
(chuckles)
Whatever. I don't care.

17:59.395 --> 18:01.320
The only reason
I was cooking that stuff

18:01.322 --> 18:02.563
was to keep her happy
and off dope.

18:02.565 --> 18:04.398
You think it matters
if your motivation

18:04.400 --> 18:06.325
is to keep your dream girl
off heroin?

18:06.327 --> 18:08.644
You're a drug dealer.
That's just the truth.

18:08.646 --> 18:10.162
I don't sell drugs.

18:10.164 --> 18:12.906
-I'm a chemist.
I create them for fun.
-(Billie scoffs)

18:12.908 --> 18:14.258
What I made

18:14.260 --> 18:15.259
didn't put Janey
in the hospital,

18:15.261 --> 18:17.653
because my science works.

18:17.655 --> 18:19.580
Now, I'm fully prepared

18:19.582 --> 18:22.249
to accept the consequences
of my actions.

18:22.251 --> 18:23.659
-Can you say that
about yourself?
-BILLIE: Oh,

18:23.661 --> 18:25.828
you are not as clever
as you think you are.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.663
-Oh, did I ask for your opinion?
-And you sure as hell
haven't earned

18:27.665 --> 18:29.665
-the moral high ground.
-What gives you the right
to talk

18:29.667 --> 18:31.500
-about a moral high ground
while you...
-AUSTIN: Hey, hey.

18:31.502 --> 18:34.186
This is not the place,
all right?

18:34.188 --> 18:36.263
-Uh...
-(Billie sighs)

18:36.265 --> 18:40.009
Trevor, why don't you go
in the waiting area

18:40.011 --> 18:42.620
and just give us a few minutes,
all right?

18:47.185 --> 18:48.960
I'm calling the police.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.461
AUSTIN:
Do it.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.946
You know, if I wasn't
a semi-observant Buddhist,

18:52.948 --> 18:55.466
I'd punch him in the throat
myself.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.027
But it occurs to me

18:58.029 --> 18:59.545
that if someone
called the cops on me

18:59.547 --> 19:03.123
every time I deserved it,
I wouldn't be standing here.

19:03.125 --> 19:06.293
Triple Board-certified all-star.

19:06.295 --> 19:09.147
Now, clearly,
you two know each other.

19:10.057 --> 19:13.025
Want to tell me what the deal is
between you two?

19:15.062 --> 19:16.712
No, I don't.

19:16.714 --> 19:19.382
What I want is to run the scans
on Janey's head

19:19.384 --> 19:21.033
and be done with both of them.

19:26.724 --> 19:28.332
Does Devon's recovery

19:28.334 --> 19:30.334
mean he was poisoned
by hydrogen sulfide?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.503
Unclear.
But seems most likely.

19:32.505 --> 19:36.507
Hydrogen sulfide
mostly comes out of septic tanks

19:36.509 --> 19:38.584
and manure pits.

19:38.586 --> 19:40.327
Devon didn't leave Chastain
yesterday.

19:40.329 --> 19:41.846
That means whatever he got
in his lungs--

19:41.848 --> 19:43.830
hydrogen sulfide
or something else--

19:43.832 --> 19:45.241
he inhaled inside the hospital.

19:45.243 --> 19:47.518
Well, if there's a poisonous
gas leak in the hospital,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.929
it could be devastating.
People could die.

19:49.931 --> 19:51.931
We may have to evacuate.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.265
Agreed.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.935
But no one else is sick yet.

19:55.937 --> 19:57.361
If we retrace Devon's steps,

19:57.363 --> 19:58.771
account for every second
of the day,

19:58.773 --> 20:01.699
there's a decent chance
we'll run into the source.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.776
I'll talk to security.

20:03.778 --> 20:05.428
I'll check with the nurses.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.931
We have to figure this out.
Fast.

20:08.933 --> 20:13.436
Hey, Bailey, what time did
Dr. Pravesh badge in yesterday?

20:13.438 --> 20:16.547
Start of his shift.
7:00 a.m.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.291
And he never badged out?

20:19.293 --> 20:22.035
Nope.
Here all day.

20:22.037 --> 20:24.388
-Thank you.
<i> -CONRAD: How many patients</i>

20:24.390 --> 20:26.724
-did he see?
-Yesterday in the ER?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.375
There were too many to count.

20:28.377 --> 20:30.302
(exhales) Well,
any out of the ordinary cases?

20:30.304 --> 20:31.896
-Toxins? Poisonings?
-No.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.880
-I'd remember that.
<i> -KIT: Does he show up</i>

20:33.882 --> 20:35.716
on any of the CCTVs
outside the ER?

20:35.718 --> 20:37.643
-Getting onto the elevator?
-We don't have cameras

20:37.645 --> 20:40.071
in the elevators, and all
of our other CCTVs went down

20:40.073 --> 20:42.907
-because
of the ransomware attack.
<i>-CONRAD: So Devon was in the ER</i>

20:42.909 --> 20:45.968
-all night?
-Yep. Well, all of my time.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.636
-What do you mean?
-I had a half shift.

20:47.638 --> 20:51.707
Uh, Shelly, the night nurse--
she finished up.

20:53.253 --> 20:56.312
<i> KIT:</i>
<i> Hi, Shelly.</i>
<i> It's Kit Voss from Chastain.</i>

20:56.314 --> 20:58.831
I'm so sorry to wake you,
but we're trying to track down

20:58.833 --> 21:01.333
Dr. Pravesh's movements
in the hospital last night.

21:01.335 --> 21:04.720
Did you ever see him
leave the ER?

21:06.248 --> 21:08.324
Do you remember
the name of the patient

21:08.326 --> 21:10.826
he went to check on?

21:10.828 --> 21:13.771
Winston Robards.
Fractured wrist.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.439
Devon sent him for X-rays.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.757
And a cast?

21:16.759 --> 21:20.594
-Casting room.
-Thanks, Shelly.
You're an angel.

21:20.596 --> 21:22.763
(sighs)

21:22.765 --> 21:24.699
♪

21:49.976 --> 21:52.226
(vent blowing)

22:11.055 --> 22:13.205
(Conrad coughs)

22:14.075 --> 22:16.292
(grunting)

22:20.565 --> 22:22.214
(coughs)

22:24.493 --> 22:27.219
(grunting)

22:30.499 --> 22:31.724
Andrew!

22:33.260 --> 22:35.186
Grab the wheelchair.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.528
One, two, three.

22:46.424 --> 22:48.424
I'm gonna take him to the ER.
Call Kit Voss,

22:48.426 --> 22:50.092
tell her
to seal off the basement.

22:50.094 --> 22:52.495
I'll notify hazmat.

22:59.161 --> 23:01.862
No, I know Dr. Voss was sorry
she couldn't be here.

23:01.864 --> 23:03.622
-Something serious came up.
-Honestly,

23:03.624 --> 23:05.383
it's a chance to meet
the famous Dr. Bell,

23:05.385 --> 23:06.792
so, uh, no worries.

23:06.794 --> 23:09.945
You know, I-I'm-I'm gonna
spare you the small talk.

23:09.947 --> 23:12.539
Chastain is a fabulous hospital.

23:12.541 --> 23:14.299
It's full of smart,
hardworking doctors,

23:14.301 --> 23:15.584
and yeah,

23:15.586 --> 23:17.061
we're a public hospital,
so no, you won't make

23:17.063 --> 23:18.303
as much money as you're used to.

23:18.305 --> 23:20.789
But, you know, I look at that

23:20.791 --> 23:21.974
as a chance to give back.

23:21.976 --> 23:24.902
To our community,
to our young residents. And,

23:24.904 --> 23:28.313
you know, and at this point
in my career, it...

23:28.315 --> 23:31.224
This feels
like the right thing to do.

23:31.226 --> 23:32.559
So come to Chastain.

23:32.561 --> 23:35.079
You'll never be sorry you did.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.707
Done.

23:42.480 --> 23:46.148
That was considerably easier
than I expected.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.908
Dr. Voss will be overjoyed.

23:47.910 --> 23:49.927
You mind
if I just make a few calls

23:49.929 --> 23:53.097
-just to do my due diligence?
-Would expect nothing less.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.324
Uh, I'll text you
some phone numbers.

23:55.326 --> 23:57.643
Great.

23:58.512 --> 24:00.104
Janey's scans are up.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.681
What you got?

24:02.683 --> 24:04.850
Mycotic aneurysm.

24:04.852 --> 24:06.593
The bacteria
from her heart valve

24:06.595 --> 24:08.687
-lodged
in her anterior cerebral artery.
-AUSTIN: Well,

24:08.689 --> 24:10.355
-that explains the vision issues
and the migraines.
-Mm-hmm.

24:10.357 --> 24:11.523
And she has a sentinel bleed.

24:11.525 --> 24:13.451
The aneurysm
has started to leak.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.027
So you'll repair it?

24:15.029 --> 24:16.603
Sure.

24:16.605 --> 24:18.847
But not until we make a decision
on replacing her heart valve.

24:18.849 --> 24:21.625
Until<i> you</i> make a decision.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.276
Look, I know some surgeons

24:23.278 --> 24:24.962
who would refuse
a valve replacement

24:24.964 --> 24:26.188
on a drug user.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.299
Some of my mentors, even.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.526
But I say, look, if she's
strong enough for surgery,

24:30.528 --> 24:33.028
this might be
the second chance she needs.

24:33.030 --> 24:35.197
Third chance, actually.

24:35.199 --> 24:38.217
She was born healthy, used,

24:38.219 --> 24:40.536
got repaired, then used again.

24:40.538 --> 24:42.462
And we have proof.

24:43.632 --> 24:46.225
Her urine tox screen
came back positive for opiates.

24:46.227 --> 24:48.227
-She's a chronic user.
-Great.

24:48.229 --> 24:50.303
I recommend
clipping the aneurysm,

24:50.305 --> 24:51.638
continue antibiotics

24:51.640 --> 24:53.565
and hold off on the
valve surgery until she's logged

24:53.567 --> 24:55.642
-some sober hours.
-Which could kill her

24:55.644 --> 24:59.071
-before she has a chance
to recover.
-Whoa, hold up.

24:59.073 --> 25:02.182
You get to decide
whether she lives or dies?

25:02.184 --> 25:05.728
-You cannot be a part
of this discussion.
-What?

25:05.730 --> 25:07.563
Who made you God?

25:07.565 --> 25:10.007
Because that's what you're doing
right now. You're playing God.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.067
Am I missing something?
You're not the patient

25:12.069 --> 25:14.903
and you're not family.
Go sit in the waiting room.

25:14.905 --> 25:16.238
TREVOR:
Oh, I am not leaving.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.848
And you're missing
everything, dude.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.683
All you see
are these lab results.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.519
You don't even know her.
Janey,

25:21.521 --> 25:24.021
who's literally
the best person I know.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.839
I'll call security.

25:25.841 --> 25:27.249
Hold up, Irving.

25:27.251 --> 25:28.675
Listen to me, dude.

25:28.677 --> 25:31.862
It's not as simple
as her being a good person.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.848
All right?
If I replace Janey's valve,

25:34.850 --> 25:36.367
her recovery's gonna be tough.

25:36.369 --> 25:39.428
Not just physically
but mentally.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.764
She's got to stay clean.

25:41.766 --> 25:43.432
That valve gets infected,

25:43.434 --> 25:46.192
she won't live long enough
to get another one.

25:46.194 --> 25:48.712
Without rock-solid support,

25:48.714 --> 25:51.531
even my masterful
surgical skills

25:51.533 --> 25:53.458
are useless.

25:53.460 --> 25:56.128
Then I'll make sure
she stays clean.

25:56.130 --> 25:57.629
No, she already
had you fooled once.

25:57.631 --> 26:00.299
What makes you think
she can't spin your head again?

26:00.301 --> 26:02.059
This is not about her,

26:02.061 --> 26:04.520
Dr. Sutton.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.625
I never abandon
the people who need me.

26:09.627 --> 26:11.986
Never.

26:13.464 --> 26:15.981
-(alarm beeping)
-HUNDLEY: Bay 2, Doctors.

26:15.983 --> 26:19.318
Janey is hypotensive.
She's crashing.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.321
Her pulse pressure
wasn't this wide before.

26:22.323 --> 26:24.656
(Janey grunting, gasping)

26:24.658 --> 26:26.232
I'm hearing crackles
half the way up.

26:26.234 --> 26:28.368
Fluid is backing up
into her lungs.

26:29.163 --> 26:30.921
I see a new paravalvular leak.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.498
-This valve is shot.
-I can still repair
the aneurysm,

26:33.500 --> 26:35.426
but we all know
that won't save her life.

26:35.428 --> 26:36.594
What's the call,

26:36.596 --> 26:38.670
Dr. Austin?
You fixing her valve or not?

26:38.672 --> 26:41.098
It's not up to me to decide
how many chances

26:41.100 --> 26:43.175
a person gets.
Brain first,

26:43.177 --> 26:45.177
then heart.
Let's book an OR.

26:45.179 --> 26:48.163
I'll start prep.
-HUNDLEY: I'll get transpo.

26:48.165 --> 26:50.165
I-Is she gonna be okay?

26:50.167 --> 26:51.424
No guarantees.

26:51.426 --> 26:52.776
They need to get her to prep.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.260
That's gonna take a minute.

26:54.262 --> 26:57.698
Meanwhile,
let's you and I have a talk.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.201
Follow. Now.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.197
Get him on 100% O2.
Bolus a liter

27:05.199 --> 27:07.273
and give him what we
gave Devon-- sodium nitrate

27:07.275 --> 27:09.201
and hydroxocobalamin.

27:10.112 --> 27:12.630
It might be too late to work,
but it's worth a try.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.466
Confirmed it was
hydrogen sulfide.

27:15.468 --> 27:18.360
Rotten egg smell
all over the casting room.

27:18.362 --> 27:19.544
I called hazmat response.

27:19.546 --> 27:22.030
KIT:
The basement's being sealed off.

27:22.032 --> 27:24.533
Do we know
how long he was exposed?

27:24.535 --> 27:26.143
Since last night.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.461
Best hope is the exposure
was low-level.

27:28.463 --> 27:30.463
Someone vented
the room he was in,

27:30.465 --> 27:32.040
so it's possible
he got a small dose.

27:32.042 --> 27:34.026
Well, here's hoping.

27:36.213 --> 27:38.897
Look, if this is gonna be
a lecture on addiction,

27:38.899 --> 27:40.732
spare me, okay?
I know it's a disease...

27:40.734 --> 27:43.402
A disease that you can't cure
no matter what drug you make.

27:43.404 --> 27:45.404
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Seriously, man, uh,

27:45.406 --> 27:48.499
there's nothing you can tell me
I don't already know.

27:48.501 --> 27:52.127
Are you gonna
fix her heart or not?

27:52.988 --> 27:54.755
Of course.

27:55.824 --> 27:58.066
Okay.

27:58.068 --> 27:59.510
Great.

28:00.662 --> 28:03.163
And you won't let Dr. Sutton
talk you out of it?

28:03.165 --> 28:06.350
What's your beef
with Dr. Sutton, huh?

28:06.352 --> 28:08.727
Home come
you keep coming at her?

28:15.010 --> 28:16.860
She's my mother.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.196
That's why.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.864
She gave birth to me

28:20.866 --> 28:24.109
and then wanted
nothing to do with me.

28:25.095 --> 28:28.021
So, if it seems
like I'm coming at her,

28:28.023 --> 28:30.999
there's your reason.

28:34.362 --> 28:37.005
Okay. Um...

28:38.108 --> 28:39.383
Look, there's a, uh,

28:39.385 --> 28:42.294
a surgery waiting room
on the fifth floor.

28:42.296 --> 28:45.038
All right?
You go there.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.725
(sighs)
And I'll call you

28:47.727 --> 28:50.310
when the surgery's over.

29:01.815 --> 29:04.199
-(faucet running)
-(scrubbing)

29:13.419 --> 29:16.569
You must have been quite young
when you had him.

29:17.331 --> 29:19.998
I should have
figured it out myself.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.760
Watching you and Trevor go at it

29:22.762 --> 29:25.929
is like watching someone fight
with themselves in the mirror.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.432
I don't want to talk about it.
I told you that.

29:28.434 --> 29:31.176
And I heard you.
But we're going to be operating

29:31.178 --> 29:33.419
on your son's friend.

29:33.421 --> 29:35.588
I know you've had
a complicated day today,

29:35.590 --> 29:37.941
and I want to respect that,
but I must

29:37.943 --> 29:40.836
point out the elephant
in the room and ask...

29:40.838 --> 29:43.280
I'll be able to do my job?

29:49.789 --> 29:51.604
Well?

29:51.606 --> 29:56.084
If you want to know,
I was 13 years old.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.378
-Hey.
-DEVON: Hey.

30:06.380 --> 30:09.381
CONRAD:
Winston's recovering.
He's awake.

30:09.383 --> 30:11.124
Lucid.

30:11.126 --> 30:13.218
He breathed in a small dose.

30:13.220 --> 30:15.461
(sighs)
That's a huge relief.

30:15.463 --> 30:18.798
It's good to hear your voice,
Dr. Pravesh.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.485
Dr. Hawkins says
you don't remember yesterday.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.895
I don't.

30:23.897 --> 30:27.491
But I thought
if I saw your face, I would.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.718
Maybe if you just listen
to my voice.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.736
I've been blind my whole life,

30:31.738 --> 30:34.706
so that's how I remember people.
(echoing)

30:38.062 --> 30:40.170
Your voice.

30:41.899 --> 30:44.174
Your father's remedy
for everything

30:44.176 --> 30:46.159
is to rub dirt on it.

30:46.161 --> 30:49.596
I thought that was hilarious.

30:51.441 --> 30:54.000
<i> I sent you to get a cast.</i>

30:54.002 --> 30:55.501
<i> You didn't come back.</i>

30:56.338 --> 30:58.263
<i> So I went down</i>
<i> to the casting room</i>

30:58.265 --> 31:00.357
<i>because I thought you were lost.</i>

31:00.359 --> 31:02.109
Hello?

31:02.862 --> 31:04.653
Hello?

31:19.378 --> 31:20.769
<i>Then you were out on the floor.</i>

31:20.771 --> 31:22.604
<i> I could smell the gas.</i>

31:22.606 --> 31:25.716
Hey, can I get
some help in here?!

31:25.718 --> 31:27.442
(coughs)

31:27.444 --> 31:28.760
(exhales)

31:30.280 --> 31:33.724
<i> -I vented the room.</i>
-(vent blowing)

31:33.726 --> 31:37.728
I tried to drag you, but I got

31:37.730 --> 31:41.640
<i> very dizzy. I-I just, like...</i>
<i> I remember I couldn't breathe.</i>

31:41.642 --> 31:45.218
<i> I thought if I could get</i>
<i>to the elevator, get to the ER,</i>

31:45.220 --> 31:46.904
<i> I could call for help.</i>

31:46.906 --> 31:48.697
(gasps, coughing)

32:07.317 --> 32:09.593
(elevator bell chimes)

32:20.272 --> 32:23.231
<i> Then everything went black.</i>

32:26.428 --> 32:28.278
CONRAD:
You turned on the vent.

32:29.506 --> 32:33.116
That cleared out the worst
of the hydrogen sulfide.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.101
Winston had limited exposure.

32:35.103 --> 32:37.079
That saved his life.

32:38.015 --> 32:40.707
You saved his life.

32:41.535 --> 32:43.126
Thank you.

32:49.876 --> 32:51.526
(Devon sighs)

32:51.528 --> 32:54.054
-(whirring)
-(monitor beeping steadily)

32:54.881 --> 32:57.307
AUSTIN:
Okay. First brain,

32:57.309 --> 33:01.203
then heart. That way,
we get in and out safely.

33:01.205 --> 33:03.463
You okay with that, Sutton?

33:03.465 --> 33:05.390
BILLIE:
You don't need to worry
about my focus.

33:05.392 --> 33:08.059
Regardless of what's going on
outside of this room.

33:08.061 --> 33:09.469
AUSTIN:
Good to know.

33:09.471 --> 33:13.198
BILLIE:
Okay, removing the skull cup.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.160
Opening the dura.

33:19.056 --> 33:21.498
Working my way down
through the fissure.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.892
AUSTIN:
Cannulating the femoral artery.

33:23.894 --> 33:25.410
BILLIE:
Okay, I see the aneurysm.

33:25.412 --> 33:28.654
Just need to establish control
around the blood flow.

33:28.656 --> 33:31.008
Clip applier to me.

33:34.738 --> 33:36.329
-(alarms beeping)
-Damn it.

33:36.331 --> 33:38.498
The aneurysm ruptured.
I need your hands. Get up here.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.742
AUSTIN:
All right. What do you need?
Consider me

33:40.744 --> 33:44.062
-your assistant.
-BILLIE: I need you
to suction the field. Now.

33:46.933 --> 33:48.508
Come on.

33:48.510 --> 33:52.512
Sutton, I watched you operate
on my mother.

33:52.514 --> 33:54.156
You got this.

34:03.358 --> 34:05.267
BILLIE:
All right. Bleeding stopped.

34:05.269 --> 34:07.435
I think I've got control.

34:07.437 --> 34:10.438
-Straight clip, please.
-AUSTIN: Great work.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.140
What'd you do?

34:12.142 --> 34:13.699
BILLIE:
Not sure.

34:13.701 --> 34:15.543
Sometimes you get lucky.

34:16.538 --> 34:18.280
-Or else...
-(alarm beeps loudly)

34:18.282 --> 34:20.557
We didn't actually fix it.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.375
AUSTIN:
Her heart is failing.
She doesn't have

34:22.377 --> 34:24.043
enough blood pressure
to bleed from the aneurysm.

34:24.045 --> 34:27.230
-Chu, how we doing?
-CHU: Not good, team.
Maxing my pressors.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.624
AUSTIN:
It's the valve. It's blown.

34:29.626 --> 34:30.959
Wide-open regurge.

34:30.961 --> 34:32.294
I'm gonna have to crack
her chest open,

34:32.296 --> 34:33.737
put her on bypass
before we lose her.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.616
And this time, Sutton,
I'm gonna need you to help me.

34:42.322 --> 34:44.581
<i> WOMAN:</i>
<i> Browner raked in the money</i>
<i> for us at St. Paul's.</i>

34:44.583 --> 34:46.750
<i> He was a publicity machine,</i>
<i> as well.</i>

34:46.752 --> 34:49.978
-And his outcomes?
<i> -Strong.</i>

34:49.980 --> 34:53.148
-Plays well with others?
<i> -I think you'll be happy.</i>

34:54.075 --> 34:57.260
Okay. Well,
that seems to be the consensus.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.346
Thank you.

35:08.089 --> 35:10.089
<i> (line rings)</i>

35:10.091 --> 35:13.259
Randolph.
Long time. What's up?

35:13.261 --> 35:15.595
<i> BELL:</i>
<i> Tina. Quick question.</i>

35:15.597 --> 35:17.263
I know you worked
with Jim Browner

35:17.265 --> 35:18.764
over at St. Paul's,

35:18.766 --> 35:20.358
and we're thinking
of hiring him.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.268
Don't do it.

35:22.270 --> 35:23.936
-Excuse me?
<i> -He's got</i>

35:23.938 --> 35:25.530
millions in lawsuits
against him.

35:25.532 --> 35:26.698
Bullying residents.

35:26.700 --> 35:28.608
Sexual harassment of nurses.

35:28.610 --> 35:31.294
He threw a cell phone at a PA.
Broke the guy's nose.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.296
<i> He's a walking court order.</i>

35:33.298 --> 35:35.781
Every doctor I spoke to
at St. Paul's

35:35.783 --> 35:37.283
gave him glowing reviews.

35:37.285 --> 35:38.451
They're trying
to unload him on you

35:38.453 --> 35:39.694
to get him off their payroll.

35:39.696 --> 35:41.196
Classic pump and dump.

35:41.198 --> 35:43.289
<i> He's costing them a fortune.</i>

35:43.291 --> 35:45.725
I have one word for you.
Run.

35:46.794 --> 35:48.478
Thanks.

35:49.873 --> 35:51.297
(monitor beeping steadily)

35:51.299 --> 35:53.299
AUSTIN:
All right, I'm inside the aorta.

35:53.301 --> 35:56.561
This valve is totally destroyed.

35:56.563 --> 35:58.638
BILLIE:
Leaflets this thick
and inflamed,

35:58.640 --> 36:01.216
patient's been sitting
on this infection for a while.

36:01.218 --> 36:02.325
AUSTIN:
And yet she was determined

36:02.327 --> 36:03.476
to keep it
from those around her.

36:03.478 --> 36:05.645
Even as her heart
started to fail.

36:06.481 --> 36:08.498
BILLIE:
Some secrets need to be kept.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.334
AUSTIN:
But they can corrode
nonetheless.

36:12.579 --> 36:14.629
Hold my valve for me.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.827
BILLIE:
What made you decide
to give her the valve?

36:21.829 --> 36:23.588
AUSTIN:
I'd always intended to

36:23.590 --> 36:25.240
if it became necessary.

36:25.242 --> 36:27.242
People make mistakes, right?

36:27.244 --> 36:29.260
And like Trevor said,

36:29.262 --> 36:32.171
no one should get to play God.

36:32.173 --> 36:35.025
Not even surgeons.

36:36.862 --> 36:40.179
In my OR,
there is no room for judgment.

36:40.181 --> 36:42.590
Not for Janey.

36:42.592 --> 36:44.659
Not for anyone.

36:50.934 --> 36:52.858
BILLIE:
Well, you were right.

36:52.860 --> 36:54.118
Fits perfectly.

36:54.120 --> 36:57.363
AUSTIN:
Now, listen,
when we leave this OR,

36:57.365 --> 37:01.593
you don't have to see Janey
or Trevor ever again.

37:02.446 --> 37:05.055
I'll handle the post-ops.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.465
And I won't say a word.

37:07.467 --> 37:09.726
To anyone.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.614
Dr. Voss.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.891
It was hydrogen sulfide gas.

37:25.893 --> 37:28.411
How the hell did that get
into Chastain?

37:28.413 --> 37:31.306
The hazmat team says it's
happened in hospitals before.

37:31.308 --> 37:32.749
Techs dump plaster of paris

37:32.751 --> 37:34.734
from casts down the drain.

37:34.736 --> 37:36.402
It clogs the pipes,

37:36.404 --> 37:39.256
so janitors
use acid-based cleaner

37:39.258 --> 37:40.832
to cut through the sludge,

37:40.834 --> 37:42.592
-and the...
-And the acid, um...

37:42.594 --> 37:44.410
Mixes with the sulfate
in the plaster,

37:44.412 --> 37:45.820
and you get hydrogen sulfide.

37:45.822 --> 37:47.413
Right.

37:47.415 --> 37:49.915
And how about the patient
Conrad found?

37:49.917 --> 37:52.494
-He's gonna make it.
-Oh, fantastic.

37:52.496 --> 37:55.497
Yeah.
But for all the good we do here,

37:55.499 --> 37:58.924
sometimes running this hospital
feels like

37:58.926 --> 38:00.593
a Sisyphean task.

38:00.595 --> 38:01.761
Ransomware attacks,

38:01.763 --> 38:04.430
gas leaks. So come on,
give me some good news.

38:04.432 --> 38:06.098
How did it go with Browner?

38:06.100 --> 38:07.191
You can't hire him.

38:07.193 --> 38:09.677
He's got a raft of problems.

38:09.679 --> 38:11.103
HR issues, lawsuits.

38:11.105 --> 38:13.865
St. Paul's was just trying
to dump him on us.

38:13.867 --> 38:17.294
-How did you find out?
-Every doctor I talked to
at St. Paul's

38:17.296 --> 38:18.611
did nothing
but sing his praises.

38:18.613 --> 38:22.040
Not a single bad word,
and it just s-seemed off,

38:22.042 --> 38:23.949
so I called a friend,

38:23.951 --> 38:26.952
and friends tell you the truth.

38:26.954 --> 38:28.696
Oh, bloody hell.

38:28.698 --> 38:32.550
Well... it's disappointing,
but at least we know

38:32.552 --> 38:35.795
the truth.
Thanks for having my back.

38:35.797 --> 38:37.647
Yeah, l-listen, I've been...

38:37.649 --> 38:40.734
I've been meaning to talk to you
about this all day.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.563
Uh...

38:45.565 --> 38:49.417
Just wanted to apologize
for yesterday, asking you out.

38:49.419 --> 38:51.644
We have
such a good thing together,

38:51.646 --> 38:53.071
and I... I don't want

38:53.073 --> 38:54.572
to mess that up
by stepping over the line,

38:54.574 --> 38:58.335
so I promise,
it won't happen again.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.586
Oh.

39:00.413 --> 39:02.154
Really?

39:02.156 --> 39:04.232
Because I was...

39:04.234 --> 39:06.901
I was wondering
if you would want

39:06.903 --> 39:08.661
to have dinner with me tonight?

39:08.663 --> 39:10.329
Yes. Absolutely.

39:11.499 --> 39:15.000
-(chuckles)
-I know
this great Italian place.

39:15.002 --> 39:17.187
Open late.

39:20.934 --> 39:22.192
Hey, it's me.

39:22.194 --> 39:25.028
Just trying you again.
Call me back.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.256
-Nic?
-CONRAD: Yeah.

39:28.258 --> 39:29.699
She's driving back from the spa.

39:29.701 --> 39:33.428
I got to pick up GiGi. She had
a long day at the nursery.

39:33.430 --> 39:35.246
I love my girls.

39:36.282 --> 39:38.023
Thought we were gonna
lose you there

39:38.025 --> 39:39.709
for a second.
I didn't like that at all.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.527
Thanks.

39:41.529 --> 39:43.287
Me, neither.

39:43.289 --> 39:45.673
I'm really happy you're okay.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.468
See you.

39:51.114 --> 39:54.724
-See you guys tomorrow.
-MAN: Thanks, Conrad.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.185
So...

39:58.972 --> 40:01.147
I was thinking...

40:02.959 --> 40:05.718
Maybe we
should move in together.

40:05.720 --> 40:08.296
So you can look after me?

40:08.298 --> 40:10.222
If you're gonna keep being
a hero, somebody has to.

40:10.224 --> 40:12.200
(chuckles softly)

40:15.062 --> 40:17.205
I'd love that.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.917
AUSTIN:
Surgery was a success.

40:37.919 --> 40:40.311
She's looking good.

40:41.498 --> 40:43.665
The recovery
is going to be a beast,

40:43.667 --> 40:47.502
but I'll check again
in the morning.

40:47.504 --> 40:48.928
I get it.

40:48.930 --> 40:50.688
No, really.
I do.

40:50.690 --> 40:54.859
The defining experience
of your life is abandonment.

40:54.861 --> 40:57.028
I don't know
what you're talki...

40:57.030 --> 40:58.705
Just shut up.

40:59.607 --> 41:01.791
I was the same way, bro.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.960
I was hurt.
I was alone.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.870
I lashed out.

41:05.872 --> 41:08.948
See, I used my words
and my intelligence

41:08.950 --> 41:11.450
like a bully uses his fists.

41:11.452 --> 41:14.620
-(chuckles softly)
-And it worked for a while.

41:14.622 --> 41:15.805
I felt good.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.049
But it never gave me
the one thing

41:18.051 --> 41:20.125
that I really wanted,

41:20.127 --> 41:22.979
which was to belong.

41:25.633 --> 41:28.059
Look, you're loyal.
You care.

41:28.061 --> 41:29.986
Everybody sees it.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.563
But in the long run?

41:33.325 --> 41:36.308
That's not going to end well,

41:36.310 --> 41:38.995
and I know you know that.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.331
But you don't know me,
so I'm not gonna be the one

41:41.333 --> 41:43.407
to tell you
don't go down that path.

41:43.409 --> 41:47.319
But I will tell you
that if you do,

41:47.321 --> 41:52.091
brother, you aren't gonna
end well, either.

41:55.663 --> 41:58.056
See you in the morning.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.282
I have to go check on a patient.

42:25.192 --> 42:28.360
How about I give GiGi
a big kiss?

42:28.362 --> 42:30.213
Oh, my gosh.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.215
You ate all your food.

42:33.034 --> 42:35.126
Let's see.

42:35.128 --> 42:36.778
Let's see where she is.

42:36.780 --> 42:39.630
-Mommy's gonna be
so impressed with you.
-(GiGi coos)

42:39.632 --> 42:41.299
Ate all your dinner.

42:41.301 --> 42:42.892
-Where are you going?
-(GiGi cries)

42:42.894 --> 42:45.562
-What? I just... Oh!
-(doorbell rings)

42:45.564 --> 42:48.047
Who's that?
Who's there?

42:48.049 --> 42:50.308
Is it Mommy?
Yes!

42:50.310 --> 42:53.628
Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy's home.

42:53.630 --> 42:57.056
Let's go.
Whee!

42:57.058 --> 42:59.659
Let's go get Mommy.

43:05.642 --> 43:08.001
Conrad Hawkins?

43:10.071 --> 43:12.755
There's been an accident.
