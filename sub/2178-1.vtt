00:45.707 --> 00:47.707
How about a ride, mister?

00:48.207 --> 00:49.623
Jennifer.

00:51.249 --> 00:53.832
Man, are you a sight for sore eyes.

00:54.873 --> 00:56.331
Let me look at you.

00:56.415 --> 00:59.623
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

01:00.248 --> 01:01.540
I haven't.

01:01.623 --> 01:03.997
Are you okay? Is everything all right?

01:09.123 --> 01:10.331
Yeah.

01:11.497 --> 01:12.956
Everything's great.

01:26.913 --> 01:28.247
Marty!

01:29.414 --> 01:31.539
You've got to come back with me.

01:32.330 --> 01:34.663
- Where?
- Back to the future.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.162
- Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc?
- I need fuel.

01:44.037 --> 01:47.121
Go ahead. Quick. Get in the car.

01:47.870 --> 01:50.579
No. Look, Doc, I just got here.
Jennifer's here.

01:50.663 --> 01:53.037
We're going to take
the new truck for a spin.

01:53.121 --> 01:55.870
Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

01:55.954 --> 01:59.745
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

01:59.829 --> 02:02.204
Do we become assholes or something?

02:02.286 --> 02:04.870
No. You and Jennifer both turn out fine.

02:04.954 --> 02:08.453
It's your kids, Marty.
Something's got to be done about them.

02:14.953 --> 02:18.453
Doc, you better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

02:18.536 --> 02:23.078
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

02:23.869 --> 02:25.244
Say, Marty!

02:25.494 --> 02:28.411
Marty, I wanted to show
you these new matchbooks...

02:28.494 --> 02:31.077
...for my auto detailing I had printed up.

02:34.661 --> 02:36.494
A flying DeLorean?

02:48.952 --> 02:50.994
What the hell is going on here?

04:26.030 --> 04:28.239
- What the hell was that?
- Taxicab.

04:28.989 --> 04:32.156
- Taxicab? I thought we were flying.
- Precisely.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.281
All right, Doc. What's going on?

04:34.364 --> 04:36.364
Where are we? When are we?

04:36.655 --> 04:39.572
We're descending toward
Hill Valley, California...

04:40.239 --> 04:41.864
<i>...at 4:29 p.m...</i>

04:41.947 --> 04:45.363
<i>...on Wednesday, October 21, 2015.</i>

04:45.446 --> 04:47.071
2015?

04:48.280 --> 04:50.280
You mean we're in the future.

04:50.363 --> 04:53.196
What do you mean?
How can we be in the future?

04:54.071 --> 04:55.488
Jennifer...

04:57.447 --> 05:00.113
...I don't know how to tell you this, but...

05:00.487 --> 05:02.404
...you're in a time machine.

05:02.779 --> 05:07.571
- And this is the year 2015?
- October 21, 2015.

05:07.737 --> 05:09.946
God, so, like, you weren't kidding.

05:10.362 --> 05:12.737
Marty, we can actually see our future.

05:12.987 --> 05:15.112
You said we were married, right?

05:15.195 --> 05:18.154
- Yeah...
- Yeah? Was it a big wedding?

05:18.237 --> 05:21.028
- We're going to see our wedding!
- Wow.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.778
- I'll see my wedding dress.
- Wow.

05:23.862 --> 05:27.486
I wonder where we live.
I bet it's a big house with lots of kids.

05:27.570 --> 05:28.945
How many kids--

05:29.028 --> 05:31.570
- Doc! What the hell are you doing?
- Relax.

05:31.862 --> 05:34.236
It's a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator.

05:34.319 --> 05:37.486
No one should know
too much about their future.

05:37.570 --> 05:40.319
<i>When she wakes up,</i>
<i>she'll think it was a dream.</i>

05:40.611 --> 05:43.652
- What did you bring her for?
- I had to do something.

05:43.736 --> 05:47.153
She saw the time machine.
I couldn't leave her with that information.

05:47.236 --> 05:49.861
Don't worry.
She's not essential to my plan.

05:50.444 --> 05:52.027
Well, you're the doc, Doc.

05:52.111 --> 05:53.777
Here's our exit.

06:22.484 --> 06:24.693
You've got to get out
and change clothes.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.568
Right now? It's pouring rain.

06:29.817 --> 06:31.525
Wait five more seconds.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.275
Right on the tick.

06:41.483 --> 06:44.400
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

06:44.941 --> 06:48.692
Too bad the post office
isn't as efficient as the weather service.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.482
Excuse the disguise, but I was afraid
you wouldn't recognize me.

06:59.566 --> 07:02.733
I went to a rejuvenation clinic
and got a whole natural overhaul.

07:02.816 --> 07:06.357
<i>Took out some wrinkles,</i>
<i>did a hair repair, changed the blood...</i>

07:06.441 --> 07:09.024
...added 30 or 40 years to my life.

07:09.441 --> 07:12.857
They also replaced my spleen and colon.
What do you think?

07:14.524 --> 07:16.190
You look great, Doc.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.024
The future.

07:21.773 --> 07:23.231
Unbelievable.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.648
- I got to check this out, Doc.
- All in good time.

07:26.732 --> 07:30.106
- We're on a tight schedule.
- Tell me about my future.

07:30.356 --> 07:32.481
Do I become, like, a rich rock star?

07:32.565 --> 07:35.398
No one should know too much
about their destiny.

07:36.148 --> 07:39.731
- I am rich, though, right?
- Marty, please, take off your shirt.

07:41.148 --> 07:43.273
Put on the jacket and the shoes.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.397
Got a mission to accomplish.

08:03.188 --> 08:04.855
Precisely on schedule.

08:10.147 --> 08:12.187
Power laces. All right.

08:32.270 --> 08:33.854
This thing doesn't fit.

08:33.937 --> 08:35.937
<i>Size-adjusting fit.</i>

08:36.020 --> 08:40.227
Pull out your pants pockets.
All kids here wear their pants inside out.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.729
Put on this cap.

08:41.811 --> 08:44.604
Perfect. You're the spitting image
of your future son.

08:44.686 --> 08:47.395
- What?
- Help me move Jennifer over here.

08:48.478 --> 08:50.936
- So what's the deal?
- Grab her feet.

08:52.603 --> 08:54.311
Okay, now what?

08:54.394 --> 08:58.311
In exactly two minutes,
you go around the corner into the Cafe '80s.

08:58.895 --> 08:59.978
Cafe '80s?

09:00.060 --> 09:02.977
It's one of those nostalgia places,
but not done well.

09:03.060 --> 09:05.603
Go in and order a Pepsi. Here's $50.

09:05.686 --> 09:07.561
Wait for a guy named Griff.

09:07.644 --> 09:09.227
Right. Griff.

09:09.311 --> 09:12.311
Griff's going to ask about tonight.
Are you in or out?

09:12.394 --> 09:13.852
Tell him you are out.

09:13.935 --> 09:17.060
Whatever he says, say no, you're not interested.

09:17.144 --> 09:20.226
Then leave,
come back here and wait for me.

09:21.226 --> 09:23.852
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't touch anything.

09:23.935 --> 09:26.351
Don't do anything.
Don't interact with anyone...

09:26.435 --> 09:28.602
...and try not to look at anything.

09:28.685 --> 09:29.934
I don't get it.

09:30.018 --> 09:33.976
- You said this had to do with my kids.
- Look what happens to your son.

09:35.018 --> 09:36.310
My son?

09:37.976 --> 09:40.018
God, he looks just like me.

09:40.267 --> 09:43.726
"Within two hours of his arrest,
Martin McFly Jr...

09:44.100 --> 09:48.100
"...was tried, convicted, and sentenced
to 15 years in the state penitentiary"?

09:48.184 --> 09:49.559
Within two hours?

09:49.642 --> 09:53.350
The justice system works swiftly
now that they've abolished lawyers.

09:53.434 --> 09:54.850
This is heavy.

09:54.933 --> 09:59.600
It gets worse. Your daughter tries
to break him out and gets sent up for 20 years.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.600
My daughter. I have a daughter?

10:02.808 --> 10:07.391
This one event starts a chain reaction
that completely destroys your entire family.

10:08.099 --> 10:10.892
Doc, this date...
This is tomorrow's newspaper.

10:10.974 --> 10:14.765
Precisely. I already went further ahead
into time to see what else happens.

10:14.849 --> 10:20.266
I backtracked everything to this one event.
We're here to prevent this event from happening.

10:20.349 --> 10:21.766
Damn! I'm late!

10:22.349 --> 10:23.974
Where are you going now?

10:24.057 --> 10:27.390
To intercept the real Marty Jr.
You're taking his place.

10:27.557 --> 10:30.265
The Cafe '80s, guy named Griff, just say no!

10:30.390 --> 10:32.932
What about Jennifer?
We can't just leave her here.

10:33.015 --> 10:35.848
She'll be safe.
It'll just be for a few minutes.

10:36.140 --> 10:41.056
Marty, be careful. That Griff has
a few short circuits in his bionic implants.

10:45.140 --> 10:46.389
The future.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.220
<i>Welcome to Texaco.</i>

11:44.721 --> 11:47.720

Shark still looks fake.

<i>You must have</i>
<i>the hostage special!</i>

All I want is a Pepsi.

13:40.591 --> 13:41.716
McFly!

13:42.882 --> 13:45.882
Yeah. I seen you around.

13:45.965 --> 13:48.299
You're Marty McFly's kid, aren't you?

13:49.299 --> 13:52.216
- Biff?
- You're Marty Jr.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.256
Tough break, kid.

13:54.506 --> 13:57.381
Must be rough being named after
a complete butthead.

13:57.465 --> 13:58.548
What's that mean?

13:58.632 --> 14:01.298
Hello. Hello. Anybody home?

14:01.590 --> 14:03.548
Think, McFly, think!

14:03.757 --> 14:06.632
Your old man? Mr. Loser?

14:06.756 --> 14:08.631
- What?
- That's right.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.423
Loser with a capital "L."

14:12.381 --> 14:14.589
Look, I happen to know George McFly is--

14:14.672 --> 14:18.214
I'm not talking about George McFly.
I'm talking about his kid.

14:18.505 --> 14:22.047
Your old man, Marty McFly Sr.?

14:22.631 --> 14:27.005
The man who took his life
and flushed it completely down the toilet.

14:28.214 --> 14:29.464
I did?

14:30.713 --> 14:32.880
I mean, he did?

14:33.505 --> 14:34.755
Hey, Gramps...

14:34.838 --> 14:38.463
...I told you two coats of wax on my car,
not just one!

14:39.296 --> 14:42.254
I just put the second coat on last week.

14:42.338 --> 14:44.796
- With your eyes closed?
- Are you two related?

14:44.880 --> 14:48.254
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

14:48.338 --> 14:50.921
You think Griff called me
Grandpa for his health?

14:51.004 --> 14:53.004
- He's Griff?
- Gramps!

14:53.629 --> 14:55.754
What the hell am I paying you for?

14:55.837 --> 14:58.962
Kid, say hello to your grandma for me.

14:59.046 --> 15:02.504
- Get out of there, Gramps.
- Take it easy!

15:03.962 --> 15:06.795
And McFly, don't go anywhere!
You're next!

15:09.670 --> 15:11.712
This is a video game.

15:13.253 --> 15:14.670
I got it working.

15:15.045 --> 15:17.086
My dad taught me about these.

15:17.711 --> 15:19.295
It is Wild Gunman.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.461
How do you play this thing?

15:21.544 --> 15:23.212
I'll show you, kid.

15:24.128 --> 15:26.252
<i>I'm a crack shot at this.</i>

15:31.252 --> 15:33.628
You mean you have to use your hands?

15:33.753 --> 15:35.711
That's like a baby's toy.

15:37.794 --> 15:39.085
Baby's toy?

15:47.627 --> 15:48.919
Pepsi Perfect.

15:49.002 --> 15:50.835
- Damn!
- Pepsi.

15:52.877 --> 15:54.210
McFly!

15:55.835 --> 15:58.793
I thought I told you to stay in here!

15:58.876 --> 16:01.876
Guys, how's it going?

16:02.585 --> 16:04.709
- McFly!
- Yeah?

16:05.210 --> 16:06.918
- McFly!
- What?

16:07.001 --> 16:08.834
Your shoe's unbelted.

16:13.417 --> 16:18.209
So, McFly, have you made a decision
about tonight's opportunity?

16:18.958 --> 16:23.501
Yeah, Griff. I was thinking about how
I'm not sure because it might be dangerous.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.501
What's wrong, McFly?

16:28.167 --> 16:30.167
You got no scrote?

16:35.750 --> 16:37.084
He's a complete wimp.

16:37.166 --> 16:41.208
What's it going to be, McFly?
Are you in or out?

16:41.375 --> 16:46.291
I just, I'm not sure that I should.
I should discuss it with my father.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.124
Your father?

16:48.208 --> 16:50.458
Wrong answer, McFly! You lose!

16:53.707 --> 16:56.791
Okay, Griff, I'll do it.
Whatever you say.

16:56.874 --> 16:58.791
Stay down and shut up.

17:00.123 --> 17:01.957
Keep pedaling, you two!

17:12.790 --> 17:14.082
Now...

17:15.040 --> 17:17.082
...let's hear the right answer.

17:18.207 --> 17:19.539
Well!

17:19.955 --> 17:22.873
Since when did you become
the physical type?

17:22.955 --> 17:24.873
The answer's no, Griff.

17:25.289 --> 17:28.830
- No?
- What are you, deaf and stupid? I said no!

17:29.289 --> 17:31.623
What's wrong, McFly? Chicken?

17:37.373 --> 17:39.331
What did you call me, Griff?

17:40.997 --> 17:43.205
Chicken, McFly!

17:43.455 --> 17:45.914
Nobody calls me...

17:48.622 --> 17:49.996
...chicken.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.330
- All right, punk!
- Look!

18:19.870 --> 18:21.787
Stop! Little girl, little girl.

18:21.870 --> 18:26.620
Stop. Look, I need to borrow your "hoverboard."

18:26.995 --> 18:29.120
- Where is he?
- Here.

18:30.161 --> 18:31.578
There!

18:37.787 --> 18:39.411
He's on a hoverboard.

18:41.869 --> 18:44.495
- Get the boards!
- Get McFly!

18:51.953 --> 18:53.702
Get him!

19:03.160 --> 19:04.535
Yeah, we got him!

19:14.826 --> 19:17.284
There's something very familiar about all this.

19:50.534 --> 19:52.658
McFly, you bojo!

19:52.741 --> 19:56.367
- Those boards don't work on water!
- Unless you've got power!

20:22.115 --> 20:23.365
Hook on!

20:32.615 --> 20:34.198
Batter up!

21:03.530 --> 21:05.030
Holy shit!

21:09.905 --> 21:11.404
Buttheads.

21:24.612 --> 21:26.363
<i>Drying mode on.</i>

21:27.113 --> 21:28.654
<i>Jacket drying.</i>

21:30.737 --> 21:32.737
<i>Your jacket is now dry.</i>

21:36.278 --> 21:38.529
Hey, kid. Hey, little girl, thanks.

21:38.654 --> 21:41.320
Keep it. I got a Pit Bull now.

21:41.445 --> 21:43.695
- Come on.
- Save the clock tower!

21:43.861 --> 21:48.070
Throw in $100
and help save the clock tower.

21:48.278 --> 21:49.486
Sorry, no.

21:49.569 --> 21:52.653
- That's an important historical landmark!
- Some other time.

21:52.736 --> 21:55.444
Lightning struck that thing 60 years ago.

21:55.528 --> 21:58.653
Wait a minute.
Cubs win World Series...

22:00.444 --> 22:03.069
- Against Miami?
- Yeah, it's something, huh?

22:03.152 --> 22:05.569
Who would've thought? 100-1 shot!

22:05.695 --> 22:08.528
I wish I could go back
to the beginning of the season...

22:08.611 --> 22:11.152
- ...bet on the Cubs.
- I just meant Miami...

22:12.985 --> 22:14.319
What did you just say?

22:14.402 --> 22:18.610
I wish I could go back to the beginning
of the season, bet on the Cubbies!

22:23.652 --> 22:26.694
This has an interesting feature.
It has a dust jacket.

22:26.777 --> 22:29.068
Books had these to protect the covers.

22:29.151 --> 22:31.568
That was before dust-repellent paper.

22:31.859 --> 22:36.235
If you're interested in dust,
we have something from the 1980s...

22:36.360 --> 22:38.068
...called a Dustbuster.

22:42.192 --> 22:45.109
- I can't lose.
- Up here!

22:45.901 --> 22:49.234
- Doc, what's going on?
- Stand by. I'll park over there.

22:49.734 --> 22:51.234
Yeah, all right.

22:53.317 --> 22:54.984
Hey, right on time.

22:55.401 --> 22:57.025
Flying DeLorean?

22:57.109 --> 22:59.650
I haven't seen one in 30 years.

23:00.566 --> 23:02.650
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

23:03.441 --> 23:05.900
I'm walking here!
I'm walking here!

23:07.441 --> 23:11.858
- What the hell?
- Don't drive trank, low-res scuzzball!

23:12.650 --> 23:14.191
Two of them?

23:14.316 --> 23:16.691
I left him in
a suspended animation kennel.

23:16.774 --> 23:18.899
Einstein never knew I was gone!

23:19.358 --> 23:20.607
Marty!

23:20.691 --> 23:24.233
What in the name
of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here?

23:24.316 --> 23:27.440
Doc, my kid showed up.
All hell broke loose.

23:27.524 --> 23:28.941
Your kid?

23:29.024 --> 23:32.399
Great Scott, I was afraid of this.

23:32.565 --> 23:37.440
I used it on Jennifer. There wasn't enough
power left to knock your son out for a full hour.

23:37.524 --> 23:39.856
Doc, Doc, look at this!

23:39.940 --> 23:41.399
It's changing.

23:53.564 --> 23:56.022
<i>I was framed!</i>

23:56.523 --> 23:59.564
Yes! Yes, of course!

24:00.564 --> 24:04.689
Because this hoverboard incident
occurred, Griff goes to jail.

24:04.939 --> 24:09.064
Your son won't go with him tonight.
That robbery won't take place!

24:09.147 --> 24:13.730
History, future history,
has been altered, and this is proof!

24:13.814 --> 24:18.564
We've succeeded, not as planned,
but no matter. Let's get Jennifer and go home!

24:20.855 --> 24:22.480
Hi, Einie. Hi, buddy.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.646
- What's this?
- A souvenir.

24:26.729 --> 24:29.105
50 years of sports statistics."

24:29.188 --> 24:31.313
Hardly recreational reading material.

24:31.397 --> 24:34.771
Doc, what's the harm
in bringing back some info on the future?

24:34.854 --> 24:36.771
We could place some bets.

24:37.688 --> 24:40.813
I didn't invent the time machine
for financial gain!

24:40.896 --> 24:43.813
The intent is to gain
a clearer perception of humanity.

24:43.895 --> 24:47.062
Our past, our future,
the pitfalls, the possibilities...

24:47.145 --> 24:51.812
...the perils, and the promise. Perhaps an answer
to that universal question, "Why?"

24:52.062 --> 24:54.187
I'm all for that.

24:54.354 --> 24:56.895
What's wrong with making
a few bucks on the side?

24:56.979 --> 25:00.478
I am going to put this in the trash.

25:02.144 --> 25:03.562
Great Scott!

25:07.061 --> 25:11.186
McFly, Jennifer Jane Parker,
3793 Oakhurst Street...

25:11.395 --> 25:12.978
...Hilldale, age 47.

25:13.061 --> 25:15.978
47? That's a hell
of a good face-lift!

25:16.061 --> 25:19.435
- What's happening?
- They used her thumbprint to assess her ID.

25:19.519 --> 25:23.144
Since thumbprints never change,
they assume she's the future Jennifer.

25:23.227 --> 25:24.435
We got to stop them.

25:24.519 --> 25:27.644
How? Tell them we're time travelers?
They'd have us committed.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.893
She's clean. We take her home.

25:29.977 --> 25:31.561
To Hilldale?

25:31.644 --> 25:33.893
<i>We won't get there before dark.</i>

25:33.977 --> 25:36.394
They're taking her to your future home!

25:36.852 --> 25:40.269
We'll arrive shortly thereafter,
get her, and return to 1985.

25:40.352 --> 25:43.309
I'll see where I live.
See myself as an old man?

25:43.393 --> 25:46.476
No, that could result in... Great Scott!

25:46.768 --> 25:49.518
Jennifer could conceivably encounter
her future self!

25:49.601 --> 25:51.976
The consequences could be disastrous!

25:52.726 --> 25:55.476
- What do you mean?
- I foresee two possibilities.

25:55.560 --> 26:00.226
One, seeing herself 30 years older would
put her into shock, and she'd pass out...

26:00.309 --> 26:03.017
...or two, the encounter
could create a time paradox...

26:03.101 --> 26:06.143
...and cause a chain reaction that would unravel...

26:06.226 --> 26:09.809
...the space-time continuum
and destroy the entire universe!

26:09.934 --> 26:11.976
Granted, that's a worst-case scenario.

26:12.058 --> 26:15.809
The destruction might be localized,
limited to our own galaxy.

26:16.559 --> 26:18.183
Well, that's a relief.

26:22.683 --> 26:25.891
Let's go and find Jennifer
before she finds herself.

26:27.641 --> 26:30.724
The skyway's jammed.
It'll take forever to get there.

26:30.891 --> 26:32.266
And this stays here!

26:32.349 --> 26:37.182
I didn't invent the time machine to win
at gambling, but to travel through time!

26:37.266 --> 26:38.766
I know.

26:48.224 --> 26:52.682
So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.

27:18.973 --> 27:20.472
Hilldale.

27:21.472 --> 27:25.347
Nothing but a breeding ground
for tranks, lobos, and zipheads.

27:25.431 --> 27:28.305
Yeah, they ought to tear
this whole place down.

27:29.972 --> 27:31.972
<i>Welcome home, Jennifer.</i>

27:34.222 --> 27:36.972
You got a little tranked,
but I think you can walk.

27:37.055 --> 27:40.555
Ma'am, you should reprogram.
It's dangerous in the dark.

27:40.638 --> 27:43.055
- Lights on?
- Yes. Now, look.

27:43.888 --> 27:46.388
Just take it easy, and you'll be fine.

27:46.638 --> 27:48.555
<i>And be careful in the future.</i>

27:49.430 --> 27:50.929
The future?

27:52.138 --> 27:54.179
Have a nice day, Mrs. McFly.

27:56.762 --> 28:00.138
<i>Broadcasting beautiful views</i>
<i>24 hours a day.</i>

28:00.470 --> 28:02.846
<i>You're tuned to the Scenery Channel.</i>

28:07.804 --> 28:10.012
I'm in the future.

28:22.137 --> 28:24.970
I get married in the Chapel O Love?

28:25.095 --> 28:27.511
Mom? Mom, is that you?

28:27.594 --> 28:29.678
I got to get out of here!

28:34.261 --> 28:35.553
Mom!

28:44.303 --> 28:46.760
Mom? Mom, is that you?

28:51.677 --> 28:53.593
- Grandma!
- Sweetheart!

28:53.677 --> 28:54.844
Hi!

28:54.927 --> 28:58.093
- What happened to Grandpa?
- He threw his back out again.

28:58.176 --> 29:01.218
- How's Granddad's little pumpkin?
- How did you do that?

29:01.302 --> 29:03.135
Out on the golf course.

29:03.801 --> 29:06.467
Are your folks home yet?
I brought pizza!

29:06.759 --> 29:09.093
- Who's going to eat all that?
- I will.

29:09.342 --> 29:10.884
Damn this traffic!

29:10.968 --> 29:14.801
Jennifer, old Jennifer gets home around now.
I hope we're not too late.

29:18.509 --> 29:22.342
- What is it? What's the matter, Doc?
- I thought I saw a taxi.

29:22.467 --> 29:24.467
I thought it was following us.

29:25.175 --> 29:27.925
I can't believe
this window's still broken.

29:28.009 --> 29:30.717
When the repairman
called Daddy a chicken...

29:30.800 --> 29:34.258
<i>...Daddy threw him out of the house.</i>
<i>Now nobody will fix it.</i>

29:34.592 --> 29:37.300
Look how worn out this is.

29:38.425 --> 29:42.508
Your father's biggest problem
is that he loses all self-control...

29:42.633 --> 29:44.550
<i>...when someone calls him chicken.</i>

29:44.633 --> 29:46.508
<i>How often have we heard it?</i>

29:46.799 --> 29:49.674
Mom, I can't let him think I'm chicken."

29:49.966 --> 29:52.216
You're right. Well, you're right!

29:52.341 --> 29:56.091
About 30 years ago, your father
tried to prove he wasn't chicken.

29:56.174 --> 29:58.382
He ended up in an automobile accident.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.966
With the Rolls-Royce?

30:00.049 --> 30:01.716
Automobile accident.

30:13.715 --> 30:16.423
All right, Einie, let's find Jennifer.

30:17.257 --> 30:20.381
I live in Hilldale? This is great!

30:20.464 --> 30:23.506
Stay here, change clothes.
If I need you, I'll holler.

30:23.590 --> 30:25.214
I want to check out my house.

30:25.298 --> 30:28.922
We can't risk you running
into your older self. Einie, let's go.

30:31.755 --> 30:32.964
Hilldale.

30:34.589 --> 30:36.006
This is bitchin'.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.255
<i>One, seven, four point five zero.</i>

30:44.380 --> 30:47.006
- That will be $174.50.
- Here.

30:47.088 --> 30:48.839
Be careful in this neighborhood.

30:48.922 --> 30:51.255
- Where's my receipt?
- Right here.

30:51.338 --> 30:52.796
How about a tip?

31:07.838 --> 31:11.796
That accident caused a chain reaction,
sending Marty's life down the tubes.

31:11.880 --> 31:15.588
Otherwise, your father's life
would have turned out differently.

31:15.671 --> 31:17.753
<i>The man wouldn't have pressed charges...</i>

31:17.837 --> 31:21.004
...Marty wouldn't have broken his hand,
given up on his music...

31:21.087 --> 31:23.712
<i>...and spent years feeling sorry for himself.</i>

31:23.920 --> 31:25.503
Hey, Mom, nice pants.

31:25.587 --> 31:28.171
The reason
your mother married him--

31:28.378 --> 31:29.503
Mom?

31:32.336 --> 31:33.920
Turn off.

31:34.295 --> 31:39.545
I want channels 18, 24, 63,
109, 87, and the Weather Channel.

31:39.628 --> 31:43.253
<i>Bringing you</i>
<i>the world's weather 24 hours a day.</i>

31:43.878 --> 31:46.170
<i>Weather conditions remain the same--</i>

31:46.378 --> 31:48.377
<i>Board-certified implant surgeons...</i>

31:48.461 --> 31:50.919
<i>Welcome home, Marty.</i>

31:51.003 --> 31:52.210
Dad's home.

31:52.419 --> 31:54.919
That's right.
He's home. Dad's home.

31:55.085 --> 31:57.210
- <i>Lord of the manor.</i>
- Hello.

31:57.294 --> 31:59.335
- <i>King of the castle.</i>
- Hello.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.835
What the hell is this?

32:02.960 --> 32:04.960
<i>Lithium mode on.</i>

32:05.043 --> 32:06.544
Yeah. That's better.

32:06.626 --> 32:08.419
Damned kids.

32:09.085 --> 32:10.085
Hey, Son.

32:11.418 --> 32:13.376
Watching a little TV for a change?

32:26.251 --> 32:27.667
Son of a...

33:07.750 --> 33:10.708
- I'm hungry.
- Just wait your turn.

33:10.874 --> 33:13.166
When it's ready,
shove it in my mouth.

33:13.249 --> 33:15.166
Don't you be a smart-ass.

33:15.874 --> 33:17.707
Hey! The Atrocity Channel.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.874
Hydrate level 4, please.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.332
Is it ready?

33:28.415 --> 33:29.707
Here you go.

33:29.790 --> 33:32.956
Mom, you sure can
hydrate a pizza.

33:33.873 --> 33:36.248
I'm sorry.
I missed that whole thing.

33:36.332 --> 33:38.748
I'm just worried about Jennifer.

33:38.831 --> 33:43.622
- Why isn't she home?
- I'm not sure where Jennifer is, Mom.

33:43.831 --> 33:46.081
She should have been home hours ago.

33:46.289 --> 33:48.664
- I can't keep track--
- Fruit!

33:49.623 --> 33:52.456
- Fruit, please.
- She's in one of those moods.

33:52.539 --> 33:54.706
Aren't you and her
getting along?

33:54.789 --> 33:58.456
Yeah. Great, Mom.
We're like a couple of teenagers.

34:00.414 --> 34:02.414
Dad, telephone. It's Needles.

34:02.955 --> 34:04.580
Dad, it's for you.

34:05.455 --> 34:08.288
All right. Well, I'll take that in the den.

34:08.455 --> 34:09.871
Retract.

34:10.455 --> 34:12.121
Hello. In here, please.

34:14.163 --> 34:16.580
<i>Hey, the big M.</i>

34:16.705 --> 34:18.621
<i>How's it hanging, McFly?</i>

34:19.204 --> 34:20.371
Hey, Needles.

34:20.455 --> 34:21.663
Needles?

34:21.746 --> 34:24.121
<i>Did you look</i>
<i>at my little business proposal?</i>

34:24.204 --> 34:26.913
- I don't know.
- <i>Why are you worried?</i>

34:26.996 --> 34:30.288
<i>If this works,</i>
<i>your financial problems are solved.</i>

34:30.621 --> 34:33.786
And if it doesn't work, Needles,
I could get fired.

34:33.871 --> 34:37.454
It's illegal.
I mean, what if the Jits is monitoring?

34:37.536 --> 34:41.078
- <i>The Jits will never find out.</i>
- God.

34:41.161 --> 34:45.703
<i>Come on. Stick your card in the slot,</i>
<i>and I'll handle it.</i>

34:46.411 --> 34:50.995
<i>Unless you want everyone</i>
<i>in the division to think you're chicken.</i>

34:55.036 --> 34:58.286
Nobody calls me chicken, Needles.

34:58.369 --> 35:00.578
- Nobody!
- <i>All right.</i>

35:01.703 --> 35:03.286
<i>Prove it.</i>

35:07.203 --> 35:08.620
All right.

35:09.328 --> 35:11.161
All right, Needles.

35:14.369 --> 35:15.785
Here's my card.

35:16.161 --> 35:18.077
<i>Scan it. I'm in.</i>

35:18.203 --> 35:21.785
<i>Thanks, McFly.</i>
<i>I'll see you at the plant tomorrow.</i>

35:24.243 --> 35:25.202
Shit.

35:27.285 --> 35:28.951
<i>McFly!</i>

35:29.660 --> 35:31.951
Fujitsu-san.

35:32.118 --> 35:33.452
<i>McFly...</i>

35:33.868 --> 35:36.993
<i>...I was monitoring that</i>
<i>scan you just interfaced.</i>

35:37.076 --> 35:38.409
<i>You are terminated!</i>

35:38.492 --> 35:41.659
Terminated. No! It wasn't my fault, sir.

35:41.743 --> 35:44.868
- Needles was behind it.
- <i>And you cooperated.</i>

35:44.951 --> 35:48.242
It was a sting operation.
I was setting him up.

35:48.326 --> 35:50.201
<i>Read my fax!</i>

35:50.284 --> 35:52.701
No! Please! I cannot be fired.

35:52.867 --> 35:54.201
<i>I'm fired.</i>

36:05.492 --> 36:07.533
This is heavy.

36:08.658 --> 36:10.867
<i>What am I going to tell Jennifer?</i>

36:10.949 --> 36:12.617
Jennifer. Jennifer.

36:12.991 --> 36:15.241
Doc. Am I glad to see you.

36:16.033 --> 36:18.824
Go out the front door. I'll meet you there.

36:18.991 --> 36:21.491
But it doesn't open. There's no doorknob.

36:21.574 --> 36:23.866
Press your thumb to the plate.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.657
What plate?

36:39.823 --> 36:41.698
What does this fax mean?

36:41.782 --> 36:45.531
Mom. It's a joke,
an office joke. It's a joke fax.

36:45.615 --> 36:49.157
- I heard you yell.
- Calm down. I wasn't yelling.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.032
Needles and I were just joking.

36:51.115 --> 36:52.948
<i>Welcome home, Jennifer.</i>

36:53.032 --> 36:55.615
Lost my job, Mom?
Get out of town.

37:00.364 --> 37:02.406
- I'm young!
- I'm old!

37:11.655 --> 37:13.198
Marty! Marty!

37:13.280 --> 37:15.697
<i>Marty, come quick! Quick!</i>

37:31.363 --> 37:34.946
She encountered her older self
and went into shock.

37:35.030 --> 37:36.446
<i>She'll be fine.</i>

37:36.571 --> 37:38.654
<i>Let's get her back to 1985.</i>

37:38.821 --> 37:41.362
Then I'll destroy the time machine.

37:41.696 --> 37:42.780
Destroy it?

37:42.863 --> 37:46.196
<i>What about that stuff</i>
<i>about humanity and where we're going?</i>

37:46.279 --> 37:48.862
The risks are too great,
as this incident proves.

37:48.945 --> 37:50.779
And I was behaving responsibly.

37:50.862 --> 37:54.112
Imagine if the time machine
fell into the wrong hands?

37:56.987 --> 37:58.112
My only regret...

37:58.196 --> 38:02.071
<i>...is that I'll never get a chance</i>
<i>to visit my favorite historical era...</i>

38:02.278 --> 38:03.695
<i>...the Old West.</i>

38:03.862 --> 38:06.944
But time traveling is just too dangerous.

38:07.861 --> 38:10.612
Better that I devote myself to study...

38:10.944 --> 38:14.028
...the other great mystery of the universe:

38:16.028 --> 38:17.236
Women.

38:19.153 --> 38:22.694
Marty, Einie, brace yourselves
for temporal displacement.

38:33.194 --> 38:34.693
Did we make it?

38:38.735 --> 38:40.277
Are we back?

38:46.985 --> 38:48.069
We're back.

39:08.859 --> 39:13.150
Let's put her in the swing.
You can return in your truck and wake her.

39:13.692 --> 39:16.150
When she awakens here
in her own house...

39:16.233 --> 39:19.067
...you can convince her it was a dream.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.025
We're just leaving her here?

39:21.900 --> 39:24.983
Disorientation will help convince her
it was a dream.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.108
How long will she be out?

39:27.192 --> 39:29.650
I'm not quite sure.
She received quite a shock.

39:29.942 --> 39:32.942
<i>Could be a few minutes,</i>
<i>probably a couple of hours.</i>

39:33.524 --> 39:36.608
- You better bring smelling salts.
- You're the doc, Doc.

39:36.691 --> 39:38.524
Come on. Let's go, Einie.

39:40.524 --> 39:42.524
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.399
I don't remember bars
being on these windows.

40:03.023 --> 40:06.106
If you need me,
I'll be in my lab dismantling this thing.

40:06.190 --> 40:07.357
Right.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.272
What the hell?

40:44.980 --> 40:47.896
Wait a minute.
What are you doing in my room?

40:47.979 --> 40:50.563
- Rape! Mom!
- Okay. Okay.

40:50.647 --> 40:53.271
- Dad, help!
- Freeze, sucker!

40:53.355 --> 40:56.938
- I don't want any trouble.
- You got trouble now, you piece of trash.

40:58.146 --> 41:01.354
- What are you doing here?
- I'm in the wrong house.

41:01.437 --> 41:03.562
You got that right, you son of a...

41:03.979 --> 41:07.229
- Look. I made a mistake.
- Damned right you made a mistake!

41:08.062 --> 41:10.937
I'm going to tear your ass up!

41:11.062 --> 41:15.978
That's right. You keep running, sucker!
Tell that realty company that I ain't selling!

41:16.354 --> 41:17.937
We won't be terrorized!

42:00.602 --> 42:02.393
This has got to be the wrong year.

42:20.768 --> 42:22.309
1985?

42:24.142 --> 42:26.059
- It can't be.
- Drop it.

42:29.642 --> 42:32.683
So you're the son of a bitch
who's been stealing my papers.

42:32.767 --> 42:34.059
Mr. Strickland.

42:34.391 --> 42:38.475
- Mr. Strickland. It's me, sir. Marty.
- Who?

42:38.558 --> 42:40.850
Martin McFly.
Don't you know me from school?

42:40.934 --> 42:44.225
I've never seen you before in my life,
but you look like a slacker.

42:44.308 --> 42:46.475
Yeah, that's right. I am a slacker.

42:46.558 --> 42:51.392
- You gave me detention last week.
- The school burned down six years ago.

42:51.475 --> 42:54.808
You have three seconds to get off my porch
with your nuts intact.

42:54.891 --> 42:57.974
- One.
- I just want to know what's going on.

42:58.058 --> 42:58.974
Two.

43:00.557 --> 43:01.724
Strickland!

43:01.933 --> 43:03.015
Yeah!

43:19.932 --> 43:21.681
Eat lead, slackers!

43:28.556 --> 43:32.806
Watch where you're going,
crazy drunk pedestrian.

43:33.139 --> 43:34.181
Red.

44:30.762 --> 44:34.804
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to the Biff Tannen Museum.</i>

44:34.929 --> 44:37.512

<i>...and America's greatest living folk hero...</i>

<i>...the one and only Biff Tannen.</i>

44:43.261 --> 44:46.928
<i>Of course we've all heard the legend,</i>
<i>but who is the man?</i>

44:47.053 --> 44:52.095

<i>...fastest gun in the West.</i>

45:00.261 --> 45:03.843
<i>See Biff's humble beginnings</i>
<i>and how a trip to the racetrack...</i>

45:03.927 --> 45:07.551
<i>...on his 21st birthday</i>
<i>made him a millionaire overnight.</i>

45:11.010 --> 45:13.802
<i>Share in the excitement</i>

45:13.885 --> 45:17.134
<i>...that earned him the nickname</i>
<i>"The Luckiest Man on Earth."</i>

45:17.385 --> 45:20.134
<i>Learn how Biff parlayed</i>
<i>that lucky winning streak...</i>

<i>...into the vast empire called Biffco.</i>

45:22.468 --> 45:24.260
<i>Discover how in 1979...</i>

45:24.385 --> 45:27.134
<i>...Biff successfully lobbied</i>
<i>to legalize gambling...</i>

45:27.218 --> 45:29.926
<i>...and turned Hill Valley's</i>
<i>dilapidated courthouse...</i>

45:30.009 --> 45:31.926
<i>...into a beautiful casino hotel.</i>

45:32.260 --> 45:36.051
<i>I just want to say one thing:</i>
<i>God bless America!</i>

45:36.842 --> 45:39.259
<i>Meet the women</i>
<i>who shared his passion...</i>

<i>...by marrying his high school sweetheart</i>
<i>Lorraine Baines McFly.</i>

45:51.633 --> 45:53.092
<i>Third time's the charm.</i>

45:55.716 --> 45:57.050
No!

45:59.424 --> 46:01.716
- No!
- Come with us upstairs.

46:01.800 --> 46:05.091
- Let me go.
- We can do this the easy way or the hard way.

46:05.925 --> 46:07.716
<i>The easy way.</i>

46:18.132 --> 46:22.841
- Mom? Mom, is that you?
- Just relax, Marty.

46:23.799 --> 46:26.091
You've been asleep
for almost two hours.

46:29.757 --> 46:32.340
I had a horrible nightmare. It was terrible.

46:33.257 --> 46:38.423
Well, you're safe and sound now,
back on the good old 27th floor.

46:38.881 --> 46:40.548
27th floor!

46:46.339 --> 46:49.506
Mom? Mom, that can't be you.

46:49.881 --> 46:52.840
Well, yes, it's me, Marty. Are you all right?

46:53.256 --> 46:56.797
I'm fine. I'm fine.
It's just that you're so... You're so...

46:58.131 --> 46:59.047
...big.

46:59.548 --> 47:02.214
Everything's going to be fine, Marty.
Are you hungry?

47:02.297 --> 47:04.214
I can call room service.

47:05.964 --> 47:07.297
Room service?

47:07.380 --> 47:11.089
- <i>Lorraine!</i>
- Oh, my God. It's your father.

47:11.296 --> 47:12.380
My father?

47:14.046 --> 47:16.880
You're supposed to be in Switzerland,
you son of a bitch!

47:17.004 --> 47:18.004
My father!

47:18.088 --> 47:20.547
You got kicked out of another boarding school?

47:21.380 --> 47:24.671
Do you know how much dough
I've blown on your no-good kids?

47:25.754 --> 47:28.671
What the hell do you care? We can afford it.

47:29.004 --> 47:32.963
The least we can do with that money
is provide a better life for our children.

47:33.587 --> 47:35.671
Hold on. Let's get this straight.

47:35.754 --> 47:37.712
Marty is your kid, not mine.

47:37.796 --> 47:40.878
All the world's money
wouldn't help that lazy bum.

47:40.962 --> 47:42.754
Stop it, Biff. Just stop it.

47:43.129 --> 47:44.379
Look at him.

47:44.546 --> 47:47.045
He's a butthead, just like his old man was.

47:49.337 --> 47:53.420
Don't you dare speak
that way about George.

47:54.711 --> 47:57.045
You're not even half the man he was.

47:59.045 --> 48:00.962
You son of a bitch!

48:05.545 --> 48:07.378
Always the little hothead?

48:14.044 --> 48:15.961
<i>You want to take a poke at me?</i>

48:19.377 --> 48:22.752
Damn it, Biff.
That's it. I'm leaving.

48:23.419 --> 48:26.168
So go ahead. Think about this, Lorraine!

48:26.252 --> 48:30.085
Who's going to pay for your clothes?
And your jewelry and liquor?

48:30.168 --> 48:32.835
Who's going to pay for your cosmetic surgery?

48:33.252 --> 48:36.710
You were the one
who wanted me to get these things.

48:37.252 --> 48:39.626
If you want them back, you can have them.

48:40.085 --> 48:41.292
Look, Lorraine.

48:41.376 --> 48:45.584
You leave and I won't only cut off you,
I'll cut off your kids.

48:46.418 --> 48:48.543
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?

48:48.626 --> 48:51.834
First your daughter Linda.
I'll cancel all her credit cards.

48:52.042 --> 48:54.459
She'll settle her debts with the bank herself.

48:54.543 --> 48:57.459
I'll have your idiot son Dave's probation revoked.

48:57.542 --> 48:58.917
And as for Marty...

48:59.709 --> 49:02.709
...maybe you'd like to have
all of your kids behind bars...

49:02.792 --> 49:04.333
...just like your brother Joey.

49:04.959 --> 49:07.166
One big happy jailbird family.

49:10.208 --> 49:13.792
All right, Biff. You win. I'll stay.

49:17.458 --> 49:21.458
As for you, I'll be back up here
in an hour, so you better not be.

49:32.911 --> 49:35.493
He was right, and I was wrong.

49:37.910 --> 49:38.951
Mom!

49:39.701 --> 49:42.576
Mom, what're you saying?
You're actually defending him.

49:42.659 --> 49:44.076
I had it coming.

49:44.410 --> 49:47.243
He's my husband,
and he takes care of all of us...

49:47.618 --> 49:50.576
- ...and he deserves our respect.
- Respect?

49:51.534 --> 49:55.284
Your husband!
How could he be your husband?

49:55.868 --> 49:59.159
- How could you leave Dad for him?
- Leave Dad?

49:59.242 --> 50:03.783
- Marty, are you feeling all right?
- No, I'm not feeling all right!

50:03.867 --> 50:06.575
I don't understand what's going on here.

50:06.658 --> 50:09.284
Why nobody can give me a simple,
straight answer.

50:09.367 --> 50:12.575
They must have hit you over the head
hard this time.

50:12.742 --> 50:15.075
Mom, I just want to know one thing.

50:15.658 --> 50:18.950
Where's my father?
Where's George McFly?

50:20.116 --> 50:21.158
Marty.

50:21.908 --> 50:27.074
George, your father, is in the same place
he's been for the past 12 years.

50:29.241 --> 50:31.241
Oak Park Cemetery.

50:57.157 --> 50:58.490
No.

51:00.865 --> 51:04.031
No! This can't be happening!

51:04.698 --> 51:06.573
"March 15, 1973."

51:07.364 --> 51:10.656
No! Please, God, no!

51:11.656 --> 51:14.406
<i>No, please, God. Please, God, no.</i>

51:14.490 --> 51:15.947
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

51:16.406 --> 51:17.822
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

51:19.447 --> 51:20.822
<i>This can't be...</i>

51:21.156 --> 51:23.655
I'm afraid it is happening. All of it.

51:24.114 --> 51:25.280
Doc!

51:25.363 --> 51:28.655
When I learned about your father,
I figured you'd come here.

51:30.822 --> 51:32.988
Then you know
what happened to him?

51:35.030 --> 51:36.696
Do you know what happened...

51:37.613 --> 51:40.696
...March 15, 1973?

51:42.738 --> 51:44.072
Yes, Marty. I know.

51:45.113 --> 51:48.362
I went to the public library
to make sense of the madness.

51:48.446 --> 51:52.154
<i>The place was boarded up.</i>
<i>I broke in and borrowed newspapers.</i>

51:52.237 --> 51:53.488
I don't get it, Doc.

51:53.571 --> 51:57.112
How can all this be happening?
It's like we're in Hell or something.

51:57.196 --> 52:01.279
No, it's Hill Valley, although
I can't imagine Hell being much worse.

52:02.237 --> 52:04.945
Einie. I'm sorry, boy.

52:05.779 --> 52:09.112
The lab is an awful, awful mess.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.737
Attaboy.

52:12.445 --> 52:15.695
Obviously,
the time continuum has been disrupted...

52:15.779 --> 52:18.362
...creating this new
temporal event sequence...

52:18.445 --> 52:21.278
- ...resulting in this alternate reality.
- English, Doc.

52:21.362 --> 52:23.652
Here, here, here. Let me illustrate.

52:28.278 --> 52:32.277
Imagine that this line represents time.

52:32.944 --> 52:36.694
Here's the present, 1985,
the future, and the past.

52:39.027 --> 52:42.194
Prior to this point in time,
somewhere in the past...

52:42.277 --> 52:44.611
...the time line skewed into this tangent...

52:44.693 --> 52:47.486
...creating an alternate 1985.

52:47.777 --> 52:51.610
Alternate to you, me, and Einstein...

52:52.069 --> 52:55.110
...but reality for everyone else.

52:59.443 --> 53:00.818
Recognize this?

53:01.443 --> 53:03.568
It's the bag the sports book came in.

53:03.652 --> 53:06.401
I know, because the receipt
was still inside.

53:06.485 --> 53:10.401
I found them in the time machine,
along with this.

53:16.151 --> 53:19.692
It's the top of Biff's cane.
I mean old Biff, from the future.

53:19.776 --> 53:24.067
Correct. It was in the time machine
because Biff was in the time machine...

53:24.150 --> 53:26.067
...with the <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

53:26.941 --> 53:27.858
Holy shit.

53:27.941 --> 53:30.858
You see, while we were in the future...

53:30.941 --> 53:35.067
...Biff got the sports book, stole
the time machine, went back in time...

53:35.150 --> 53:38.316
...and gave the book to himself
at some point in the past.

53:38.650 --> 53:42.650
Look. It says right here...

53:42.733 --> 53:48.024
<i>...that Biff made his first $1,000,000</i>
<i>betting on a horserace in 1958.</i>

53:48.816 --> 53:50.149
He wasn't just lucky.

53:50.232 --> 53:53.483
He knew, because he had
the race results in the <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

53:53.815 --> 53:55.982
That's how he made his entire fortune.

53:57.316 --> 53:59.690
Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass.

54:02.066 --> 54:03.815
The <i>Almanac</i>.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.523
Son of a bitch stole my idea.

54:07.482 --> 54:10.023
He must have been listening when I...

54:11.898 --> 54:12.856
It's my fault.

54:13.814 --> 54:17.023
The whole thing is my fault.
If I hadn't bought that damn book...

54:17.315 --> 54:19.148
...none of this would have happened.

54:19.232 --> 54:21.148
- It's all in the past.
- The future.

54:21.232 --> 54:25.814
Whatever. It demonstrates precisely
how time travel can be misused...

54:25.898 --> 54:28.856
...and why the time machine
must be destroyed...

54:29.272 --> 54:31.439
...after we straighten all of this out.

54:31.606 --> 54:33.689
Right. So we go back to the future...

54:33.773 --> 54:36.397
...and we stop Biff
from stealing the time machine.

54:36.481 --> 54:41.272
We can't, because if we travel
into the future from this point in time...

54:41.356 --> 54:44.939
...it will be the future of this reality...

54:45.480 --> 54:48.064
...in which Biff is corrupt and powerful...

54:48.855 --> 54:51.688
...and married to your mother,
and in which...

54:53.605 --> 54:55.855
...this has happened to me.

55:01.396 --> 55:05.979
No. Our only chance to repair
the present is in the past...

55:06.230 --> 55:09.646
...at the point where the time line
skewed into this tangent.

55:10.395 --> 55:13.896
In order to put the universe back
as we remember it...

55:14.395 --> 55:18.854
...and get back to our reality,
we have to find out the exact date...

55:19.187 --> 55:22.604
...and the specific circumstances
of how, where, and when...

55:22.937 --> 55:26.354
...young Biff got his hands
on that <i>Sports Almanac</i>.

55:28.728 --> 55:29.728
I'll ask him.

55:53.894 --> 55:58.186
Bulletproof vest! Great flick!
Great frigging flick!

55:58.268 --> 56:00.061
<i>The guy is brilliant.</i>

56:00.602 --> 56:02.268
What the hell's going...

56:02.352 --> 56:06.727
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- Party's over, Biff.

56:07.976 --> 56:09.185
Sorry, ladies.

56:09.352 --> 56:11.851
How did you get past my security downstairs?

56:12.768 --> 56:14.768
There's a matter we need to talk about.

56:14.851 --> 56:18.893
- Yeah. Money, right? Well, forget it.
- No. Not money.

56:20.768 --> 56:24.518
<i>Gray's Sports Almanac.</i>

56:27.934 --> 56:29.476
You heard him, girls.

56:30.267 --> 56:31.434
Party's over.

56:32.767 --> 56:35.642
Start talking, kid.
What else do you know about that book?

56:37.975 --> 56:40.226
First you tell me how you got it.

56:41.267 --> 56:44.517
How, where, and when.

56:46.934 --> 56:49.225
All right. Take a seat.

56:53.225 --> 56:54.558
Sit down!

56:58.766 --> 57:01.557
November 12, 1955. That was when.

57:01.641 --> 57:04.766
November 12, 1955.
That was the date I went back...

57:06.100 --> 57:09.891
That was the date
of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm.

57:11.307 --> 57:13.849
You know your history. Very good.

57:14.890 --> 57:16.682
I'll never forget that Saturday.

57:16.973 --> 57:20.973
<i>I'd picked my car up from the shop</i>
<i>because I'd rolled it in a drag race.</i>

57:21.807 --> 57:24.432
I thought you crashed into a manure truck.

57:25.807 --> 57:27.515
How do you know about that?

57:28.473 --> 57:30.182
My father told me about it.

57:30.681 --> 57:32.057
Your father?

57:32.848 --> 57:34.348
Before he died.

57:35.807 --> 57:37.306
Yeah. Right.

57:38.723 --> 57:40.972
So there I was, minding my own business.

57:41.473 --> 57:43.847
<i>This crazy old codger with a cane shows up.</i>

57:44.972 --> 57:48.514
He says he's my distant relative.
I don't see any resemblance.

57:50.597 --> 57:53.014
<i>So he says, "How would you like to be rich?"</i>

57:54.222 --> 57:55.847
So I said, "Sure."

58:00.639 --> 58:02.681
<i>So he lays this book on me.</i>

58:02.764 --> 58:07.430
<i>He says this book will tell me the</i>
<i>outcome of every sporting event this century.</i>

58:07.721 --> 58:10.680
All I have to do is bet on the winner
and I'll never lose.

58:14.263 --> 58:18.971
So I said, "What's the catch?"
He says, "No catch. Just keep it a secret."

58:22.805 --> 58:24.638
<i>After that, he disappeared.</i>

58:25.346 --> 58:27.012
<i>I never saw him again.</i>

58:39.470 --> 58:41.345
<i>He told me one more thing.</i>

58:42.012 --> 58:44.470
He said, "Someday a crazy,
wild-eyed scientist...

58:44.553 --> 58:47.095
<i>"...or a kid may show up</i>
<i>asking about that book.</i>

58:48.136 --> 58:50.053
And if that ever happens..."

58:55.636 --> 58:59.178
Funny. I never thought it would be you.

58:59.678 --> 59:03.135
Biff, you're forgetting one thing.
What the hell is that?

59:09.052 --> 59:11.261
You're dead, you little son of a bitch!

59:24.343 --> 59:26.718
- There he is!
- Wait, kid!

59:37.634 --> 59:39.968
Hurry! There he is!

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.591
Go ahead, kid. Jump.

01:00:12.299 --> 01:00:14.174
<i>A suicide will be nice and neat.</i>

01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:16.716
What if I don't?

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.341
Lead poisoning.

01:00:19.508 --> 01:00:21.132
What about the police, Biff?

01:00:21.466 --> 01:00:23.924
They're going to match the bullet with that gun.

01:00:24.007 --> 01:00:26.590
Kid, I own the police.

01:00:28.049 --> 01:00:32.340
Besides, they couldn't match up
the bullet that killed your old man.

01:00:32.632 --> 01:00:34.882
You son of a...

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.965
I suppose it's poetic justice.

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:43.840
Two McFlys with the same gun.

01:00:55.506 --> 01:00:56.798
Idiot.

01:01:02.172 --> 01:01:03.422
What the hell...

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:09.381
Nice job, Doc!

01:01:10.672 --> 01:01:14.297
You're not going to believe this.
We've got to go back to 1955.

01:01:14.381 --> 01:01:15.755
I don't believe it.

01:01:27.547 --> 01:01:30.255
That's right, Doc.
November 12, 1955.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.505
Unbelievable that old Biff
could've chosen that particular date.

01:01:33.587 --> 01:01:37.338
It could mean that that point in time
contains some cosmic significance...

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.462
...as if it were the temporal junction point
of the entire space-time continuum...

01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:44.254
...or it could just be
an amazing coincidence.

01:01:47.337 --> 01:01:51.837
Damn! Got to fix that thing.
All right. Time circuits on.

01:01:52.504 --> 01:01:56.628
What do you mean, time circuits on?
Doc, we're not going back now.

01:01:57.545 --> 01:02:00.711
What about Jennifer? What about Einstein?
We can't leave them.

01:02:00.795 --> 01:02:03.336
Don't worry.
Assuming we succeed on our mission...

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.503
...this alternate 1985
will be changed into the real 1985...

01:02:06.586 --> 01:02:09.670
...instantaneously transforming
around Jennifer and Einie.

01:02:09.753 --> 01:02:11.586
<i>Jennifer and Einie will be fine.</i>

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:14.420
<i>They'll have no memory</i>
<i>of this horrible place.</i>

01:02:14.503 --> 01:02:15.503
Doc.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:20.378
- What if we don't succeed?
- We must succeed.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.460
This is heavy, Doc.

01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:38.335
It's like I was here yesterday.

01:02:38.419 --> 01:02:41.460
You were here yesterday, Marty.
Amazing, isn't it?

01:02:41.585 --> 01:02:44.377
Sunrise should be in about 22 minutes.

01:02:44.835 --> 01:02:48.293
You go into town.
Track down young Biff and tail him.

01:02:48.376 --> 01:02:52.251
Sometime today, old Biff will show up
to give young Biff the <i>Almanac</i>.

01:02:52.418 --> 01:02:54.501
Above all you must not interfere.

01:02:54.584 --> 01:02:57.584
Let old Biff believe he's succeeded
so he'll leave 1955...

01:02:57.668 --> 01:03:00.000
- ...and bring the DeLorean to the future.
- Right.

01:03:00.084 --> 01:03:03.167
Once old Biff is gone,
grab the <i>Almanac</i> anyway that you can.

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:07.334
- Remember, our futures depend on this.
- You don't have to remind me of that.

01:03:07.542 --> 01:03:11.792
Here's some binoculars
and a walkie-talkie to keep in contact.

01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:15.084
<i>I'll stay and repair the short in the time circuit.</i>

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:18.333
That way, we don't risk anyone else
stealing the time machine...

01:03:18.417 --> 01:03:22.542
...and I won't risk
accidentally running into my other self.

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:25.833
- Other self?
- Yes. There are now two of me here...

01:03:25.958 --> 01:03:27.791
...and there are two of you here.

01:03:27.916 --> 01:03:31.791
The other me is
the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955.

01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:36.749
<i>The other me that helps</i>
<i>the other you get back to 1985.</i>

01:03:37.666 --> 01:03:41.833
Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower?
That doesn't happen until tonight.

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:45.749
Be careful not to run into your other self.
Let me give you some money.

01:03:49.207 --> 01:03:51.999
Have to be prepared
for all monetary possibilities.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.456
- Get yourself some '50s clothes.
- Check, Doc.

01:03:56.707 --> 01:03:58.249
Something inconspicuous.

01:03:59.832 --> 01:04:02.082
Doc. Come in. This is Marty. Over.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:07.123
- <i>Roger, this is Doc. Are you there?</i>
- Yeah, Doc. I'm at the address.

01:04:08.164 --> 01:04:11.831
<i>It's the only Tannen in the book,</i>
<i>but I don't think this is Biff's house.</i>

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.706
<i>It looks like an old lady lives here.</i>

01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:15.290
- Biff!
- Yeah.

01:04:15.956 --> 01:04:20.081
- Where are you going, Biff?
- I'm going to get my car, Grandma.

01:04:20.164 --> 01:04:23.497
When are you coming back?
I want you to rub my toes.

01:04:23.914 --> 01:04:25.706
Shut up, you old bag.

01:04:25.998 --> 01:04:27.789
Give us our ball back.

01:04:28.372 --> 01:04:30.205
- What ball?
- That ball!

01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:31.871
What are you talking about?

01:04:32.372 --> 01:04:34.205
Give us our ball!

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:35.746
Ball?

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:38.122
- Is this your ball?
- Yeah!

01:04:38.205 --> 01:04:39.830
- You want it back?
- Yeah.

01:04:42.538 --> 01:04:43.997
Go get it.

01:04:47.788 --> 01:04:52.162
Doc, it is Biff's house. I'm on him. Over.

01:05:05.246 --> 01:05:08.453
She's all fixed up,
but I couldn't get her started.

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:12.120
- Got a kill switch?
- You just need the right touch.

01:05:12.203 --> 01:05:14.620
Nobody can start this car but me.

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:17.537
- The bill comes to $302.57.
- $300?

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:20.245
$300 for a couple of dents? That's bullshit.

01:05:20.328 --> 01:05:22.744
It was horseshit.
The whole car was horseshit.

01:05:22.828 --> 01:05:25.995
- Jones wanted $80 to haul it away.
- I bet he resold it.

01:05:26.078 --> 01:05:29.078
- I got to get something.
- You want something?

01:05:29.161 --> 01:05:32.078
You can call Jones and
if he wants to give you a refund--

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:36.953
$300! If I catch the guy
that caused this I'll break his neck.

01:05:37.578 --> 01:05:40.452
The manure. I remember that.

01:05:46.827 --> 01:05:48.244
4 cans of Valvoline.

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:52.160
- 4 cans for a $300 job?
- I can't have lunch in there.

01:05:52.244 --> 01:05:55.285
- Makes me nauseous.
- I should get a case for $300.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:57.702
It smells worse than the bathroom.

01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:01.243
<i>The stench is never going to go away, Biff.</i>

01:06:01.326 --> 01:06:03.743
<i>Last time I do you a favor. Last time.</i>

01:06:10.368 --> 01:06:14.951
It's perfect, Lorraine.
You're going to look so good!

01:06:20.117 --> 01:06:21.409
You're going to look--

01:06:21.492 --> 01:06:24.284
Look at what we have here.
Nice dress, Lorraine.

01:06:24.367 --> 01:06:26.950
Although I think you'd look better
wearing nothing.

01:06:27.367 --> 01:06:31.992
- Take a long walk off a short pier.
- There's that dance at school tonight.

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:33.533
<i>Now that my car's fixed...</i>

01:06:33.616 --> 01:06:37.366
...I'll give you the honor of going
with the best-looking guy in school.

01:06:37.449 --> 01:06:38.449
I'm busy.

01:06:38.533 --> 01:06:40.159
- Doing what?
- Washing my hair.

01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:42.783
That's as funny
as a screen door on a battleship.

01:06:42.992 --> 01:06:45.283
Screen door on a submarine, you dork.

01:06:45.408 --> 01:06:47.949
Biff, somebody already asked me
to the dance.

01:06:48.324 --> 01:06:50.366
Who? That bug George McFly?

01:06:51.199 --> 01:06:55.615
- I'm going with Calvin Klein, okay?
- Calvin Klein? No, it's not okay.

01:06:56.324 --> 01:06:59.574
- You're going with me, understand?
- Get your cooties off me!

01:06:59.657 --> 01:07:03.199
When will you get it through your skull?
You're my girl.

01:07:04.032 --> 01:07:07.532
I wouldn't be your girl
even if you had a million dollars!

01:07:11.282 --> 01:07:14.449
Yes, you will! It's you and me, Lorraine.

01:07:14.657 --> 01:07:15.781
Watch it!

01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:17.449
It's meant to be.

01:07:17.865 --> 01:07:22.031
I'm going to marry you someday, Lorraine.
Someday you'll be my wife!

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.364
You always did have a way with women.

01:07:27.906 --> 01:07:29.781
Get the hell out of my car, old man.

01:07:29.865 --> 01:07:32.947
You want to marry that girl?
I can help make it happen.

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:36.947
- Who are you, Miss Lonely-hearts?
- Just get in the car, butthead.

01:07:38.072 --> 01:07:40.239
Who are you calling butthead, butthead?

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:43.822
How did you do that?
Nobody can start this car but me.

01:07:44.822 --> 01:07:48.530
Get in the car, Tannen.
Today's your lucky day.

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.029
Watch where you're driving, old man.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.363
<i>If you dent this car, I'll kill you.</i>

01:08:03.405 --> 01:08:07.612
- This cost me $300!
- Would you shut up about the car?

01:08:07.946 --> 01:08:11.446
- How do you know where I live?
- Let's just say we're related, Biff.

01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:14.362
That being the case, I got a present for you.

01:08:14.446 --> 01:08:16.319
Something that'll make you rich.

01:08:16.904 --> 01:08:20.862
- You want to be rich, don't you?
- Yeah. Sure. Right. That's rich.

01:08:21.112 --> 01:08:22.778
You're going to make me rich?

01:08:23.446 --> 01:08:26.446
You see this book?
This book tells the future.

01:08:26.571 --> 01:08:30.404
Tells the results of every major sports event
till the end of this century.

01:08:30.486 --> 01:08:34.361
Football, baseball, horseraces, boxing.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:39.111
The information in here is worth millions,
and I'm giving it to you.

01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:41.528
That's very nice. Thank you very much.

01:08:41.778 --> 01:08:45.611
Now, why don't you make like a tree
and get out of here?

01:08:46.653 --> 01:08:50.319
It's leave, you idiot. Make like a tree and leave.

01:08:50.403 --> 01:08:52.777
You sound like a fool when you say it wrong.

01:08:52.861 --> 01:08:55.569
All right, leave. And take your book with you.

01:08:56.652 --> 01:09:00.152
Don't you get it?
You could make a fortune with this book.

01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:01.736
Let me show you.

01:09:06.152 --> 01:09:08.859
<i>UCLA trails 17-16.</i>

01:09:08.943 --> 01:09:12.402
<i>It's 4th and 11</i>
<i>with only 18 seconds left of this game.</i>

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:14.901
<i>I'd say it's all over for UCLA.</i>

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:19.234
Bet you a million bucks UCLA wins it 19-17.

01:09:19.568 --> 01:09:23.943
- What are you, deaf? It's over. You lost.
- Yeah?

01:09:24.984 --> 01:09:27.901
<i>Here comes Decker with the kick.</i>
<i>It's up and looks good.</i>

01:09:27.984 --> 01:09:32.276
<i>Ball's in the clear.</i>
<i>Field goal! UCLA wins 19-17.</i>

01:09:32.693 --> 01:09:36.443
<i>Listen to that Coliseum crowd go wild.</i>
<i>Jim Decker...</i>

01:09:36.567 --> 01:09:40.026
All right. What's the gag?
How did you know what the score would be?

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.192
I told you, it's in this book.

01:09:42.317 --> 01:09:45.609
All you got to do is bet on the winner,
and you'll never lose.

01:09:51.317 --> 01:09:53.233
All right. I'll take a look at it.

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:58.025
You damn fool!

01:09:58.483 --> 01:10:01.358
Never leave this book laying around.

01:10:01.482 --> 01:10:04.357
Don't you have a safe?
No, you don't have a safe.

01:10:05.566 --> 01:10:10.149
Get a safe. Keep it locked up.
Until then, keep it on you.

01:10:10.232 --> 01:10:13.482
- What are you doing?
- Don't tell anybody, either.

01:10:13.566 --> 01:10:18.566
There's one more thing.
One day, a kid or a crazy old man...

01:10:18.899 --> 01:10:22.316
<i>...who claims to be a scientist</i>
<i>is going to come around asking...</i>

01:10:47.398 --> 01:10:49.647
I'm trapped. Doc.

01:10:49.856 --> 01:10:51.064
<i>Doc, come in.</i>

01:10:51.148 --> 01:10:52.939
- What's the report?
- <i>Biff's gone.</i>

01:10:54.106 --> 01:10:56.689
He's got the book.
I'm locked in Biff's garage.

01:10:57.314 --> 01:10:58.939
<i>Get me the hell out of here.</i>

01:10:59.731 --> 01:11:01.147
I'm at 1809 Mason Street.

01:11:01.689 --> 01:11:05.272
I can't take the DeLorean.
Don't worry. Somehow I'll get there.

01:11:05.355 --> 01:11:08.688
Doc, wait a minute. Doc. Doc.

01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:11.563
Perfect.

01:11:15.022 --> 01:11:18.313
Biff! Where are you going now?

01:11:18.688 --> 01:11:21.062
I told you, Grandma,
I'm going to the dance.

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:23.521
- When you coming home?
- The dance.

01:11:23.605 --> 01:11:25.354
I'll get home when I get home.

01:11:27.646 --> 01:11:30.521
Don't forget to turn out
the garage light.

01:12:02.478 --> 01:12:04.020
Marty. Marty!

01:12:04.728 --> 01:12:05.644
<i>Marty.</i>

01:12:07.977 --> 01:12:10.436
Marty, Marty. Damn!

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:12.894
Where is that kid?

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:21.727
Doc. Doc, come in.

01:12:22.602 --> 01:12:23.643
<i>Come in, Doc.</i>

01:12:24.518 --> 01:12:25.810
Marty! Come in.

01:12:26.226 --> 01:12:27.143
Doc.

01:12:31.226 --> 01:12:32.143
Marty.

01:12:33.435 --> 01:12:34.518
My...

01:12:36.684 --> 01:12:38.726
Great Scott.

01:12:54.309 --> 01:12:55.392
My God.

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:01.975
Doc, Doc, come in.

01:13:02.476 --> 01:13:05.267
Marty, what happened?
You weren't at Biff's house.

01:13:05.433 --> 01:13:09.349
I'm in Biff's car, heading for
the Enchantment Under The Sea dance.

01:13:10.641 --> 01:13:14.141
We may have to abort this entire plan.
It's getting much too dangerous.

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:17.349
The book's on his dashboard.
I'll grab it when we arrive.

01:13:17.767 --> 01:13:21.099
You must be careful
not to run into your other self.

01:13:21.183 --> 01:13:22.433
- <i>My other self?</i>
- Yes.

01:13:23.349 --> 01:13:26.891
Remember your mother is
at that exact same dance with you.

01:13:26.974 --> 01:13:30.932
- <i>Right. This could get heavy, Doc.</i>
- Heavy, heavy.

01:13:31.016 --> 01:13:33.766
Whatever happens,
don't let your other self see you!

01:13:33.849 --> 01:13:37.390
- The consequences could be disastrous.
- Excuse me, sir.

01:13:38.432 --> 01:13:39.766
Yes, you with the hat.

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.682
- Who, me?
- Yes.

01:13:42.806 --> 01:13:46.057
Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths inch wrench
from the toolbox.

01:13:47.474 --> 01:13:48.890
Five-eighths?

01:13:50.681 --> 01:13:53.223
Don't you mean three-quarters?

01:13:54.015 --> 01:13:56.057
Why, you're right.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:14:01.348
I presume you're conducting
some sort of weather experiment.

01:14:03.473 --> 01:14:06.389
That's right. How did you know that?

01:14:06.639 --> 01:14:10.097
I happen to have had a little experience
in this area.

01:14:10.597 --> 01:14:13.431
I'm hoping to see some lightning tonight...

01:14:13.513 --> 01:14:16.472
...although the weatherman says
there's no chance of rain.

01:14:16.555 --> 01:14:19.764
There's going to be plenty of rain.
Wind, thunder, lightning.

01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:24.472
- It's going to be one hell of a storm.
- Thanks. Nice talking to you.

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:27.764
Maybe we'll bump into each other again
in the future.

01:14:29.639 --> 01:14:31.138
Or in the past.

01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:14.053
Doc, Doc! Come in!

01:16:26.634 --> 01:16:30.008
Where's that punk Calvin Klein, anyway?

01:16:30.091 --> 01:16:32.258
I don't know. I ain't his secretary.

01:16:32.342 --> 01:16:35.217
Well, find him.
He caused me $300 damage.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.841
I owe him a knuckle sandwich. Get going!

01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:41.591
- Aren't you coming?
- I'm reading.

01:17:34.214 --> 01:17:36.255
Well, well, Mr. Tannen.

01:17:37.506 --> 01:17:39.339
<i>How nice to see you here.</i>

01:17:39.546 --> 01:17:43.963
- Why, Mr. Strickland, nice to see you, sir.
- Is that liquor I smell, Tannen?

01:17:44.463 --> 01:17:45.755
I wouldn't know.

01:17:45.838 --> 01:17:48.963
I don't know what it smells like
because I'm too young to drink it.

01:17:49.047 --> 01:17:50.088
I see.

01:17:50.713 --> 01:17:52.588
What have we here?

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:59.505
Sports stats,
interesting subject. Homework, Tannen?

01:17:59.588 --> 01:18:03.046
No, it ain't homework,
because, I ain't at home.

01:18:04.338 --> 01:18:07.171
You got a real attitude problem, you know?

01:18:07.254 --> 01:18:10.295
One day I'll have you where I want you,
in detention.

01:18:11.212 --> 01:18:12.253
Slacker!

01:18:24.878 --> 01:18:26.503
Jesus, you smoke, too?

01:18:26.586 --> 01:18:29.669
Marty,
you sound just like my mother.

01:18:29.753 --> 01:18:31.170
Yeah, right.

01:18:31.252 --> 01:18:34.544
When I have kids,
I'll let them do anything they want.

01:18:34.628 --> 01:18:36.044
<i>Anything at all.</i>

01:18:36.419 --> 01:18:39.127
- I'd like to have that in writing.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:18:39.211 --> 01:18:41.794
Marty, why are you so nervous?

01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:48.372
Yes!

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:53.288
No!

01:20:55.872 --> 01:20:57.622
<i>"Oh LàLà"?</i>

01:20:58.205 --> 01:20:59.580
<i>"Oh LàLà"?</i>

01:21:01.871 --> 01:21:03.288
<i>"Oh LàLà"?</i>

01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:11.621
- Doc! Doc!
- Hey, you.

01:21:11.704 --> 01:21:14.621
- Doc, come in!
- <i>Marty, what's up?</i>

01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:17.371
Doc! I'm in trouble. I blew it.

01:21:17.454 --> 01:21:19.829
- Where's the book?
- <i>Biff must have it.</i>

01:21:19.912 --> 01:21:22.496
- I've only got the cover.
- <i>Where's Biff?</i>

01:21:22.579 --> 01:21:24.621
- <i>You're asking for it.</i>
- I don't know.

01:21:24.703 --> 01:21:28.537
- <i>Any idea?</i>
- No! He could be anywhere by now.

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:32.246
The entire future depends on you
getting that book!

01:21:32.329 --> 01:21:35.037
- I know. I just don't--
- Stop it!

01:21:35.162 --> 01:21:38.995
<i>Stop it, Biff. You'll break his arm. Stop it!</i>

01:21:42.787 --> 01:21:43.869
Of course!

01:21:44.869 --> 01:21:48.994
I gotta go. I got one chance!
My old man is about to deck Biff!

01:21:56.452 --> 01:21:57.327
Yes!

01:22:10.952 --> 01:22:12.868
Talk about déjà vu.

01:22:12.952 --> 01:22:14.827
Are you okay?

01:22:34.326 --> 01:22:36.284
Okay, everybody, let's back up.

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:40.408
Everybody just back up.
Give him a little bit of room.

01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:42.867
It's okay. I know CPR.

01:22:43.118 --> 01:22:44.784
I know CPR.

01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:47.909
- What's CPR?
- You!

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:54.575
- He's fine.
- Did you just take his wallet?

01:22:54.659 --> 01:22:56.450
He took that guy's wallet.

01:22:56.866 --> 01:22:58.950
<i>Doc, success. I got it.</i>

01:22:59.367 --> 01:23:01.283
Thank goodness.

01:23:02.283 --> 01:23:03.533
Great, Marty.

01:23:04.033 --> 01:23:08.491
As soon as I reload the fusion generator
we'll meet on the roof of the school gym.

01:23:08.574 --> 01:23:09.908
On the roof. 10-4.

01:23:09.991 --> 01:23:12.950
- It's him!
- He's in disguise.

01:23:13.199 --> 01:23:14.825
Guys, what's that?

01:23:16.699 --> 01:23:18.408
Come on! Let's get him!

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:26.657
Damn!

01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:08.280
All right! Let's do another.

01:24:08.364 --> 01:24:11.239
Where did he go?
He just came in here!

01:24:14.446 --> 01:24:18.238
- Look! How did he get on stage?
- When he's through, we'll nail him.

01:24:18.321 --> 01:24:20.697
How did he change his clothes so fast?

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:23.196
<i>It's an oldie</i>
<i>where I come from.</i>

01:24:23.405 --> 01:24:25.613
<i>All right, guys, blues riff in B.</i>

01:24:25.697 --> 01:24:29.029
<i>Watch me for the changes,</i>
<i>and try and keep up, okay?</i>

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:36.154
<i>Doc, come in!</i>

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:37.113
Come in.

01:24:37.196 --> 01:24:41.612
Listen, Biff's guys chased me into the gym.
They're going to jump "me."

01:24:41.696 --> 01:24:43.112
Get out of there!

01:24:43.195 --> 01:24:47.570
No, not me. The other me.
The one on stage playing <i>Johnny B. Goode</i>.

01:24:48.612 --> 01:24:52.570
He could miss his opportunity to return!
We'll have a major paradox!

01:24:52.653 --> 01:24:54.153
Wait. A paradox?

01:24:54.404 --> 01:24:57.070
One of those things
that could destroy the universe?

01:24:57.945 --> 01:25:02.361
You have to stop those guys
without being seen by your other self.

01:25:02.444 --> 01:25:03.611
10-4.

01:25:04.987 --> 01:25:06.444
What the hell?

01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:11.528
- Where is he?
- Who?

01:25:11.611 --> 01:25:13.069
- Calvin Klein.
- Who?

01:25:13.236 --> 01:25:15.902
- With the hat, where is he?
- He went that way.

01:25:16.735 --> 01:25:18.819
I think he took your wallet.

01:25:19.111 --> 01:25:20.777
I think he took his wallet.

01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:19.438
<i>I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet...</i>

01:27:20.605 --> 01:27:23.147
<i>...but your kids are going to love it.</i>

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.646
Doc, success. Everything's cool.

01:27:33.938 --> 01:27:37.063
<i>Great. I'll be landing</i>
<i>at the roof in one minute.</i>

01:27:37.188 --> 01:27:38.521
I'll be there.

01:27:46.354 --> 01:27:47.396
Lorraine.

01:27:47.646 --> 01:27:51.521
Marty, that was very interesting music.

01:27:56.396 --> 01:27:58.437
I hope you don't mind.
George asked to take me home.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.854
Yeah. Great. Great.
I had a feeling about you two.

01:28:01.937 --> 01:28:03.520
I had a feeling, too.

01:28:04.353 --> 01:28:05.728
Butthead!

01:28:06.937 --> 01:28:09.895
You think that stupid disguise can get by me?

01:28:10.645 --> 01:28:12.186
Let's have it out.

01:28:12.437 --> 01:28:15.061
You and me, right now.

01:28:15.728 --> 01:28:17.145
No, thanks.

01:28:19.103 --> 01:28:20.561
What's the matter?

01:28:21.186 --> 01:28:22.853
Where are you going?

01:28:23.353 --> 01:28:24.894
Are you chicken?

01:28:26.394 --> 01:28:27.853
That's it, isn't it?

01:28:27.936 --> 01:28:29.936
Nothing but a little chicken.

01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:47.727
Nobody calls me a--

01:28:56.059 --> 01:28:57.351
What the hell...

01:28:59.685 --> 01:29:01.393
You steal my stuff?

01:29:03.184 --> 01:29:05.268
And this one's for my car!

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:34.474
Doc! I blew it.

01:29:34.933 --> 01:29:38.433
Biff nailed me. He took the book.
He drove away with it in his car.

01:29:38.516 --> 01:29:40.641
It's my fault. I should have left sooner.

01:29:40.725 --> 01:29:43.725
- No time for that. Where did he go?
- To the River Road Tunnel.

01:29:43.808 --> 01:29:44.766
Get in!

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:57.390
Yes!

01:29:57.849 --> 01:29:59.640
There he is, Doc!

01:29:59.724 --> 01:30:03.682
- Let's land on him and cripple his car.
- That's a '46 Ford. We're a DeLorean.

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:05.682
He'll rip us like tin foil.

01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:08.390
- So what do we do?
- I have a plan.

01:30:08.473 --> 01:30:13.723
<i>Repeating tonight's weather bulletin,</i>
<i>a severe thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley.</i>

01:30:35.389 --> 01:30:37.680
<i>Serving Hill Valley and Hill County...</i>

01:30:37.763 --> 01:30:41.055
<i>...you're tuned to KKHV, the voice of Hill Valley.</i>

01:30:48.638 --> 01:30:52.638
<i>Turning to community calendar,</i>
<i>the Hill Valley Women's Club bake sale...</i>

01:30:52.722 --> 01:30:55.096
<i>...will be held tomorrow from 2:00 to 5:00...</i>

01:30:55.179 --> 01:30:57.762
<i>...at the community center on Forest Road.</i>

01:30:57.846 --> 01:31:01.679
<i>For you sports fans,</i>
<i>there was much action today in college football.</i>

01:31:01.762 --> 01:31:03.846
<i>Here's what happened to the top 10.</i>

01:31:03.929 --> 01:31:07.512
<i>UCLA narrowly defeated Washington 19-17.</i>

01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:10.887
<i>Michigan State crushed Minnesota 42-14.</i>

01:31:11.096 --> 01:31:13.596
<i>Ohio State beat Iowa 20-10.</i>

01:31:13.887 --> 01:31:16.470
- <i>Michigan blanked Indiana 30-0.</i>
- Shit.

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:19.761
- <i>It was Notre Dame over North Carolina...</i>
- Son of a bitch.

01:31:19.845 --> 01:31:22.761
<i>Oklahoma ripped Iowa State 52-0.</i>

01:31:23.636 --> 01:31:26.678
<i>West Virginia lost to Pittsburgh 26-7.</i>

01:31:26.845 --> 01:31:29.595
<i>Texas A&M over Rice 20-10.</i>

01:31:29.887 --> 01:31:32.469
<i>Maryland defeated Clemson 25-12...</i>

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:36.469
<i>...and it was Texas Christian over Texas 47-20.</i>

01:31:36.636 --> 01:31:40.094
<i>Repeating tonight's earlier weather bulletin,</i>
<i>a severe thundershower...</i>

01:31:40.177 --> 01:31:41.469
You again?

01:31:42.927 --> 01:31:44.094
God!

01:31:45.386 --> 01:31:46.760
Let it go!

01:31:53.969 --> 01:31:55.510
Let go of this car!

01:32:29.467 --> 01:32:31.176
That'll teach him.

01:34:05.464 --> 01:34:07.213
Go, Doc!

01:34:07.297 --> 01:34:08.838
Hold on, Marty!

01:34:14.296 --> 01:34:15.463
Shit!

01:34:22.171 --> 01:34:23.296
Yes!

01:34:33.378 --> 01:34:36.670
Manure! I hate manure!

01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:03.210
Doc, is everything all right? Over.

01:35:03.377 --> 01:35:06.002
<i>It's very miserable flying weather...</i>

01:35:06.085 --> 01:35:08.835
...much too turbulent
for a landing from this direction.

01:35:08.918 --> 01:35:12.252
I'll have to approach from the south.
Have you got the book?

01:35:12.918 --> 01:35:15.336
In my hand, Doc! I got it in my hand!

01:35:15.918 --> 01:35:16.960
Burn it!

01:35:17.418 --> 01:35:18.543
Check!

01:36:14.124 --> 01:36:17.124
Doc! Doc! The newspaper changed.

01:36:17.207 --> 01:36:18.999
Doc, my father's alive!

01:36:19.249 --> 01:36:21.749
<i>That means everything's back to normal, right?</i>

01:36:25.498 --> 01:36:27.457
Mission accomplished.

01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:30.540
That means Jennifer's okay
and Einie's okay, right?

01:36:30.624 --> 01:36:33.498
That's right, Marty. It's the ripple effect.

01:36:33.665 --> 01:36:35.874
The future is back, so let's go home.

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:38.665
Right. Let's get our asses back to the--

01:36:44.873 --> 01:36:46.748
Doc, Doc, are you okay?

01:36:46.956 --> 01:36:48.248
<i>That was a close one.</i>

01:36:48.332 --> 01:36:50.290
I almost bought the farm.

01:36:53.539 --> 01:36:56.998
Well, be careful.
You don't want to get struck by lightning.

01:37:11.538 --> 01:37:12.663
Doc.

01:37:21.622 --> 01:37:22.705
Doc?

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:25.580
Doc, come in, Doc.

01:37:27.246 --> 01:37:28.787
Doc, do you read me?

01:37:30.038 --> 01:37:32.330
Do you read me, Doc? Come in.

01:37:32.787 --> 01:37:33.746
Doc.

01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:47.370
No.

01:37:56.162 --> 01:37:57.329
He's gone.

01:37:59.661 --> 01:38:01.162
<i>The Doc's gone.</i>

01:38:24.119 --> 01:38:25.827
Mr. McFly!

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.410
Is your name Marty McFly?

01:38:37.619 --> 01:38:38.535
Yeah.

01:38:40.951 --> 01:38:43.243
I've got something for you.

01:38:45.534 --> 01:38:46.701
A letter.

01:38:48.242 --> 01:38:50.242
A letter for me?

01:38:51.201 --> 01:38:52.659
That's impossible.

01:38:54.284 --> 01:38:56.867
- Who the hell are you?
- Western Union.

01:38:57.326 --> 01:39:01.784
Many of us at the office were hoping
you could shed some light on the subject.

01:39:02.201 --> 01:39:04.242
We've had that envelope in our possession...

01:39:04.284 --> 01:39:06.992
...for the past 70 years.

01:39:09.575 --> 01:39:12.575
It was given to us
with the explicit instructions...

01:39:12.658 --> 01:39:16.742
<i>...that it be delivered</i>
<i>to a young man with your description...</i>

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:21.283
...answering to the name of Marty
at this exact location...

01:39:21.533 --> 01:39:25.574
...at this exact minute, November 12, 1955.

01:39:25.991 --> 01:39:29.116
We had a bet going on whether this Marty
would actually be here.

01:39:29.283 --> 01:39:30.741
Looks like I lost.

01:39:31.949 --> 01:39:33.449
Did you say 70 years?

01:39:33.532 --> 01:39:38.199
Yes. 70 years, 2 months, 12 days, to be exact.
Sign on line 6, please.

01:39:38.282 --> 01:39:39.657
Here you are.

01:39:50.324 --> 01:39:52.698
It's from the Doc!

01:39:56.199 --> 01:39:59.032
Dear Marty,
if my calculations are correct...

01:39:59.114 --> 01:40:03.698
<i>"...you will receive this letter immediately after</i>
<i>the DeLorean's struck by lightning.</i>

01:40:03.782 --> 01:40:06.656
First let me assure you I'm alive and well.

01:40:06.947 --> 01:40:10.323
I've been living happily
these past eight months in the year 1885.

01:40:10.406 --> 01:40:12.031
The lightning bolt..."

01:40:12.281 --> 01:40:13.572
1885!

01:40:14.114 --> 01:40:15.781
<i>"September, 1885."</i>

01:40:16.447 --> 01:40:19.530
Wait, kid!
Wait a minute. What's this all about?

01:40:19.822 --> 01:40:21.322
He's alive!

01:40:21.572 --> 01:40:23.113
The Doc's alive!

01:40:23.405 --> 01:40:27.530
- He's in the Old West, but he's alive.
- Kid, you all right?

01:40:27.697 --> 01:40:29.155
Need any help?

01:40:29.489 --> 01:40:31.821
There's only one man who can help me.

01:41:47.027 --> 01:41:48.735
Doc! Doc!

01:41:49.526 --> 01:41:51.360
Doc! Doc!

01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:55.443
Relax, Doc. It's me. It's me! It's Marty.

01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:58.068
Impossible. I sent you back to the future.

01:41:58.151 --> 01:42:00.151
I know, you did send me back...

01:42:00.443 --> 01:42:03.193
...but I'm back. I'm back from the future.

01:42:06.651 --> 01:42:08.276
Great Scott!

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:11.235
Doc!

01:42:11.817 --> 01:42:12.901
Doc.

01:42:13.275 --> 01:42:14.442
Doc.

01:42:35.150 --> 01:42:36.316
McFly.

01:42:43.941 --> 01:42:45.982
That's right, Tannen!

01:42:46.399 --> 01:42:49.316
Come on, runt! You can dance better than that!
