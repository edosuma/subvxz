01:42.235 --> 01:46.739
You should've
just rang the doorbell,
brendan. Come on.

01:46.739 --> 01:50.243
Hey, you! Yeah, you!
What are you doin'?

01:50.243 --> 01:52.612
We found this truck
on the side of the road.

01:52.612 --> 01:57.117
There might be some
transmission trouble.
You might wanna check it out.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.252
What's goin' on here?
Hey, that's the truck.

01:59.752 --> 02:02.755
The one stolen in newark?
Hey, what are you doin'
with the truck, asshole?

02:04.257 --> 02:07.260
It's a gift
from tony soprano.

02:10.763 --> 02:13.766
Let's call the cops.
Those are the fucking guys
that killed hector.

02:14.017 --> 02:17.520
I don't fuckin' believe it.
We just returned the biggest
score of my whole year.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.522
Listen, you fuck.

02:19.522 --> 02:23.026
Uncle junior's been
breakin' tony's balls'cause
you hijacked that truck.

02:23.026 --> 02:26.029
You're lucky tony doesn't
shove the cab up your ass.

02:28.031 --> 02:30.033
What else
did comley say?

02:31.534 --> 02:33.036
Nothin' much.

02:33.536 --> 02:36.039
There was some stuff
missing from the truck,

02:36.539 --> 02:39.542
but he didn't give a fuck
as long as the thing's back.

02:39.542 --> 02:43.546
Then he said to tell tony
thank you, and if there's
anything tony needs, call.

02:43.546 --> 02:45.048
Tony?

02:45.298 --> 02:49.052
Those fuckin' junkie fucks,
they work for tony,
they hijack carmine's truck,

02:49.052 --> 02:51.554
i get it back,
and old man comley's
thanking tony?

02:51.671 --> 02:57.177
Well, i think
you should've taken care of this
christopher moltisanti thing...

02:57.177 --> 02:59.179
the minute
it first happened.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.682
You should've sent
a clear- cut signal:
You fuck with junior soprano--

03:02.682 --> 03:06.686
take it easy.
We're not making
a western here.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.443
Fuckin' family.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.946
I bought his kid
a $400 surfboard
for his birthday.

03:42.105 --> 03:44.107
Mr. Soprano?

03:44.607 --> 03:46.609
How you doin'?

03:52.615 --> 03:55.618
What's that,
a trick picture out there?

03:55.618 --> 03:59.122
- Which?
- The barn.

03:59.122 --> 04:02.625
And the old tree,
all rotted out inside.

04:02.625 --> 04:05.628
It's just a picture
i bought, um--

04:05.628 --> 04:08.631
i- i remember--
in a little gallery
in provincetown.

04:09.132 --> 04:12.135
That is a special- made
psychological picture,

04:12.135 --> 04:15.138
like that, uh,
that what- do- you- call- it test.

04:17.140 --> 04:19.142
The "korshack."

04:19.142 --> 04:21.144
You think
i want to trick you?

04:21.144 --> 04:23.646
- Oh, no.
- What does that picture
say to you?

04:23.646 --> 04:25.648
It says,"hey, asshole,
we're from harvard.

04:25.648 --> 04:29.652
What do you think about
this spooky, depressing barn
and this rotted- out tree?"

04:30.153 --> 04:32.155
It's depressing
and scary to you?

04:32.155 --> 04:34.157
Not to me.

04:34.157 --> 04:37.160
But it's got that
built right into it.

04:38.161 --> 04:39.662
How are things?

04:39.662 --> 04:41.664
Good.

04:41.664 --> 04:43.666
Had a real good week.

04:45.168 --> 04:47.670
Friend of mine's
in the hospital.

04:47.670 --> 04:52.175
That's never pleasant,
but otherwise
i'm having a good week.

04:52.675 --> 04:55.178
What's he in for?
First they thought
it was an ulcer.

04:55.178 --> 04:57.180
Then this, then that.

04:57.180 --> 04:59.182
You worried about him?
Jackie?

04:59.182 --> 05:02.685
Jackie's so fuckin' mean,
he'll scare that cancer away.

05:03.186 --> 05:05.188
Your friend has cancer.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.358
Dr. Stevens, dial 107.

05:08.358 --> 05:10.860
Hey, jackie,
when they hook you up,

05:10.860 --> 05:14.864
do you watch to make sure they
don't have air in your veins, or
do you think this is bullshit?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.482
What do you mean?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.484
This is a good hospital,
sweetheart.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.987
Nothing like that
is gonna happen here.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.239
Air in the line'll
kill ya.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.241
Know who else--
hey.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.745
Know who else
has cancer?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.747
Tommy dipalma.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.250
He's got it much worse
than you, though.
It's eatin' his brain away.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.003
Is somebody havin' a baby
or what?
Hey!

05:37.003 --> 05:39.505
How you doin'?
How are ya?

05:39.505 --> 05:41.507
How you feelin'?
Good. Good.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.011
Hey, hesh, good to see you.
Thanks for comin'.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.014
Jackie.
Lookin' well, pal.
Hey, thank you.

05:48.147 --> 05:49.649
Here, ro.
Jackie.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.652
You're beautiful.
You're beautiful.
This is a surprise.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.405
Mikey, nice to see you again
in men's clothing.

05:55.405 --> 05:57.407
I think i should grab
a fire extinguisher.

05:57.407 --> 06:01.911
Heard a friend of yours had
a spontaneous combustion
in his restaurant.

06:02.412 --> 06:04.914
I'm going to the cafeteria.
You want anything?

06:05.164 --> 06:08.167
- Yeah, a plate of braciole.
-

06:08.167 --> 06:11.170
you look good.
They got grappa
in this thing?
I wish.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.923
See you later.
I got some errands, jackie.

06:13.923 --> 06:16.926
Give junior my love.
I will.

06:17.427 --> 06:19.929
Hey, tell my uncle
i sent back
the fuckin' truck.

06:19.929 --> 06:22.682
Now give me that quart
of vinegar peppers
he owes me.

06:22.932 --> 06:25.051
Sure.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.054
Oof.
Thank god he left.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.057
He's a nice guy, but he's
like the grim fuckin' reaper.

06:31.557 --> 06:35.561
It's like he knows every guy
with a fuckin' cancer cell,
and he can't wait to tell ya.

06:35.561 --> 06:39.065
You know, jackie,
you might be a candidate
for clinical trials.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.567
These, uh,
stump cell therapies--

06:41.567 --> 06:44.821
paulie, don't you listen?
He don't wanna hear
no more cancer talk.

06:45.204 --> 06:46.706
Get the fuck outta here.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.208
Trust me, you caught a break
bein' jewish.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.211
See what
i gotta deal with?

06:52.462 --> 06:56.966
Jews. Jews, that's right.
I knew there was somethin'.
You know that guy teittleman?

06:57.216 --> 07:01.220
Owns all that property.
Got a motel down the street
from the club.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.973
The jew with the black clothes
and the curls and everything.

07:03.973 --> 07:05.475
They're called hasidim.

07:05.975 --> 07:07.477
Hasidim,
but i don't believe'em.

07:07.477 --> 07:09.979
What's he want,
this teittleman?

07:10.480 --> 07:13.099
- A divorce for his daughter.
- What are you talkin' about?

07:13.099 --> 07:17.103
Teittleman's son- in- law will not
give teittleman's daughter
the consent...

07:17.103 --> 07:20.106
unless teittleman gives him
50 percent of his motel.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.108
They call it a "get."

07:22.108 --> 07:24.110
Why don't he just, uh--

07:24.494 --> 07:27.497
uh, it's, it's taboo
for their religion.

07:27.497 --> 07:29.499
You know
about this shit?

07:29.499 --> 07:33.002
Run, huh? Trust me.
You don't want to do business
with these people.

07:33.503 --> 07:36.506
He said there's 25 large in it
if we can get him this here,
uh, this here "get."

07:37.006 --> 07:38.508
There's an old saying
amongst jews:

07:39.008 --> 07:41.511
When a jew gets a divorce,
even the altar sheds tears.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.379
All right, i heard enough.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.516
Hey, look, i'm gettin'
kinda tired here.

07:48.017 --> 07:52.388
- Let's go get a cup of coffee.
- We'll see ya later, jackie.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.273
Good night, jackie.
Yeah.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.667
That crash you all heard
was meadow soprano
jumping her cue.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.554
Miss marris,
we're really exhausted
from studying for s. A. T. S.

08:24.554 --> 08:26.556
We were up past 2:00
last night.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.558
- Are you her lawyer?
- No.

08:29.058 --> 08:31.177
Why they'd schedule the s. A. T. S
the same week as our recital--

08:31.677 --> 08:33.429
- sameday.
- What?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.683
Get kicked out
of concert singers...

08:38.183 --> 08:40.186
and there goes
our best extracurricular.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.188
Good- bye, berkeley,
hello, glassboro state.

08:43.188 --> 08:48.194
I cannot wait until the
whole north american land mass
is between me, tony and carmela.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.196
New jersey blows.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.198
I want to go to berkeley
so bad.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.200
The whole east,
i can't deal anymore.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.702
So we don't sleep
till after the s. A. T. S.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.705
Don't mind the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.209
I couldn't wait.
I had to see the new house.
Where's king arthur?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.211
Oh, he's downstairs.
This plumbing--

09:05.211 --> 09:07.213
here?
Yeah.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.217
Oh, i love
the coziness.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.720
Welcome
to the neighborhood.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.223
Well, the school district,
anyway.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.860
Carm, you did not
have to do this.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.363
I mean,
we don't see each other
like we used to, and--

09:24.864 --> 09:27.233
i want that to change.

09:30.620 --> 09:33.122
- Could this be artie bucco?
- Hey, capitan.

09:33.372 --> 09:37.376
Place looks good.
Ah, it needs a little work,
but we'll get there.

09:37.376 --> 09:41.631
You need some start- up cash
until the insurance settlement
on the restaurant comes--

09:41.631 --> 09:43.633
ha!
Insurance.

09:43.633 --> 09:46.636
There'll be an italian president
before i see any
insurance money.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.888
I thought that was settled.
Join the club.

09:49.138 --> 09:51.641
They're putting us through
a second arson investigation.

09:51.641 --> 09:55.895
Do they think you're mobbed up?
You're a working stiff.
It doesn't make any sense.

09:56.145 --> 09:59.649
Who would burn down
a perfectly good restaurant?

09:59.649 --> 10:01.767
It's stupid.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.770
Insane.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.774
I'm sorry, artie.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.777
Life goes on, no?
I could always be
a plumber, no?

10:11.777 --> 10:13.779
Only one concept to master.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.032
Shit runs downhill.
Yes, it does.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.168
Come in the kitchen.
I'll buy you a beer.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.432
Mr. Soprano.
Mr. Teittleman.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.434
My pleasure.
Please,
have a seat.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.436
Thank you.
Silvio you know.

10:37.436 --> 10:40.940
Paulie.
Paulie,
how are you?

10:41.057 --> 10:44.060
This is my son.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.564
- Does he have a name, or
do we have to give him one?
- Oh, i'm sorry. It's hillel.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.202
You know the story
about my daughter
and her husband?

10:53.703 --> 10:55.204
Yeah, he knows.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.457
- Do you have a daughter,
mr. Soprano?
- Yes.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.459
Call me tony.

11:00.459 --> 11:03.462
What would you do
if your daughter was
abused by her husband?

11:03.462 --> 11:06.966
Talk to him.
Yeah,
in ball- peen hammer.

11:07.466 --> 11:08.968
I think you understand
my anger.

11:08.968 --> 11:13.472
He's not only harming
my daughter, but he's mocking
our laws of marriage.

11:13.472 --> 11:16.976
Look, let's
understand each other
from the get- go here, okay?

11:16.976 --> 11:19.478
I'm in the carton and
waste- management business.

11:19.478 --> 11:22.982
I'm only here because
i'm a friend of silvio's,
you're a friend of silvio's.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.235
You may be having
a family problem
that i can help you with,

11:26.235 --> 11:28.738
and if i can do it,
that'll make me happy.

11:28.738 --> 11:31.607
- What's your fuckin'
problem, pal? -

11:41.617 --> 11:43.619
please finish.

11:43.619 --> 11:47.373
- You're being shaken down
for 50 percent of your motel.
- Correct.

11:47.757 --> 11:51.761
And the rabbi goon squads
who used to smack these husbands
around to get the divorce?

11:51.761 --> 11:55.631
They've been put out of business
by the d. A. 's office.

11:55.631 --> 11:59.135
All right, 25 percent.
He wants 50, we get 25.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.638
- I don't understand.
- That's'cause
i'm not talking to you.

12:12.782 --> 12:16.786
You get me what i want,
mr. Soprano,
and you have a deal.

12:16.786 --> 12:18.788
It's done.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.159
Put these people in our motel,
and you'll never get them out.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.161
That's a commercial,
isn't it?

12:33.169 --> 12:36.172
Julio, before lunch
i want you to do
bedding inventory.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.174
Si, si, si.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.676
Half hour.
And nocervezas,
please.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.682
Yes,
may i help you?

12:46.682 --> 12:48.684
That depends.
Are you ariel?

12:48.684 --> 12:51.821
That also depends.
Are you a bill collector?

12:52.071 --> 12:55.074
What is this, the catskills?
Shecky greene, we got here.

12:55.074 --> 12:58.828
- We want to talk to you
about your father- in- law.
- I'm sorry, he's not here.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.579
We know he's not here,

13:00.579 --> 13:04.083
but we want to talk to you
about him and you,

13:04.583 --> 13:07.586
him...
and this little problem
that you're having.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.089
Look,
i don't know who you are,

13:10.089 --> 13:14.093
but any problem i may or may not
be having with my family
is none of your matter.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.095
So get out of here, huh?

13:16.095 --> 13:19.598
Now, now, look,
shlomo is a friend of mine.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.100
And you're bragging this?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.102
Oh, this guy--

13:23.102 --> 13:25.104
listen, listen.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.106
You couldn't
possibly understand
what's going on here.

13:27.473 --> 13:31.477
Shlomo is an arrogant,
ignorant control freak.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.480
Look, i know him
since before i had hair
on mypetzel.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.981
I made this place.

13:36.365 --> 13:40.736
The flyers,
the car rental drop- off,
the business breakfast,

13:40.736 --> 13:42.738
it was me, not him.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.741
I sweated blood
into this place,
and he owes me,

13:45.741 --> 13:47.743
and i intend
to get what's mine.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.246
So please,
don't embarrass yourself
any further.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.248
Just leave.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.250
I'm not embarrassed.
You embarrassed?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.254
Listen to me,
you weirdo fuck.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.256
You give shlomo
whatever he wants,

14:00.256 --> 14:02.258
and you forget
this 50 percent shit.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.260
You got nothin'
comin' to ya.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.262
You understand me?
Nothin'!

14:06.262 --> 14:08.264
Fuck you!
Bupkes.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.266
Say"bupkes,"paulie.
What?

14:10.266 --> 14:12.768
That's how they say
"nothin'."

14:12.768 --> 14:15.271
Fuck that.
This is how i say "nothin'."

14:15.271 --> 14:17.273
How's that
for nothin'?

14:20.776 --> 14:22.411
You know what?

14:22.411 --> 14:24.413
Probably not.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.415
The fund- raiser
of pediatrics hospital?

14:26.415 --> 14:29.418
I'm gonna hire
artie and charmaine
to cater it.

14:31.420 --> 14:34.924
Come on, this fund- raiser.
Since when do we open our house
to strangers?

14:35.174 --> 14:37.676
Oh, you're right.
Let's just move back
to italy.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.679
We'll live
in a little hill town,
just like our ancestors,

14:41.180 --> 14:43.182
put a big wall
around it,

14:43.682 --> 14:46.685
and we'll throw burning oil
at all the travelers
that knock at the gate.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.192
Poor charmaine.

14:53.192 --> 14:56.195
I tried to find nice things
to say about that house.

14:56.195 --> 14:59.698
It wasn't that bad.
It just needs a little work,
that's all.

14:59.698 --> 15:01.700
Those two are so broke.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.702
That fire.

15:03.702 --> 15:05.704
If that insurance'd
get off its ass--

15:05.704 --> 15:09.208
- do you think
it could've been arson?
- What's the matter with you?

15:12.711 --> 15:14.713
Hey!

15:20.970 --> 15:23.839
Yeah, put matt on.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.841
Hold on.
What's going on
in here?

15:25.841 --> 15:28.344
You trying to damage
your inner ears?
We're studying.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.847
These are just
practice tests,
and they're brutal.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.233
Your parents know
you're here this late?

15:34.483 --> 15:36.485
Yeah.
They don't care.
She's sleeping over.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.857
Can hunter
please sleep over?

15:42.241 --> 15:44.994
Start sleeping, then.
Study time's over.

15:44.994 --> 15:48.364
We still have
six more chapters left.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.367
Then can you keep
the decibel level
down, please?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.369
For my husband.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.374
Matt,
i'm serious, you guys.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.377
Matt, if we can't
score some crystal,
we're dead.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.264
Okay, with this budget
we can do three waiters
for the passed hors d'oeuvres,

16:05.264 --> 16:07.266
two for the champagne.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.268
It's such a load off,
you're helping.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.271
The whole party has me
at sixes and sevens.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.773
Pediatric hospital's
such a worthy cause.
Oh, no.

16:14.773 --> 16:18.027
Oona!

16:18.394 --> 16:21.397
There is fingerprints
all over the breakfront.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.149
I want this place
to sparkle.

16:25.534 --> 16:28.537
She's usually very good.
From poland.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.157
Please get in the car,
sir.
Come on.

16:32.157 --> 16:36.912
Like the cop would be callin'
this asshole "sir" if the
fuckin' cameras weren't around.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.415
I saw this one anyway.

16:39.415 --> 16:44.420
So why don't you call tony
so he can call junior and see
if we can change the channel.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.422
Get that,
will ya, babe?

16:46.422 --> 16:49.425
Sure. I'm the only one
who has to go to work
around here.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.927
Yeah, restaurant hostess.
Real tough work.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.929
It's your little cousin.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.932
Hi, adriana.
Hey.
How you doin'?

16:56.932 --> 16:59.184
- What are you doing here?
- Hello to you, too.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.186
And hunter,
what are you doin'?

17:01.186 --> 17:03.188
Don't mind him.
His brain is fried.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.190
You want a soda
or somethin'?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.192
How'bout a beer?
Yeah, right.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.195
Just kidding.
I'll have a coke,
if you have one.

17:11.195 --> 17:14.333
- So, what do you want, meadow?
- I think she wants
somethin' from me.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.835
In your dreams, brendan.

17:16.835 --> 17:20.455
So, if you don't want somethin',
what do you want?

17:20.955 --> 17:22.458
I want to cop.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.346
Here you go.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.348
What do you mean,
"cop"?

17:29.348 --> 17:31.850
Score.
We want to score
some crystal.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.603
- Yeah? You got money?
- Shut up!
You ain't givin' them shit.

17:35.104 --> 17:38.607
- Why not?
- For starters, your father'll
put a bullet in my head.

17:38.607 --> 17:41.610
Since when do you
take speed, anyway?

17:41.610 --> 17:44.613
She doesn't.
I need it to study for exams.

17:44.613 --> 17:47.483
Yeah, right.
Hunter needs it.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.119
Forget about it.
No fuckin' way.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.624
- What?
- He just craves attention,
hunter.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.497
Fine. Just thought i'd ask you
before we went down
to jefferson avenue.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.501
Those moolinyans'll rob you,
rape you and leave you
by the side of the road.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.638
I don't know
what you see in him.

18:10.139 --> 18:11.640
Money.
What do you think?

18:12.141 --> 18:14.143
Fuck you.
See ya,
christopher.

18:14.143 --> 18:16.645
I got my own money.
What about me?

18:16.895 --> 18:19.014
Nobody's gonna say
good- bye to me?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.402
Bye.
- Bye. -

18:23.902 --> 18:25.404
bye, guys.

18:28.907 --> 18:32.911
You can't let her go down
to jefferson ave.
They'll sell her ajax.

18:32.911 --> 18:36.415
She's not gonna go down there.
She's just tryin' to get me
to give her some speed.

18:36.415 --> 18:40.419
Isn't it better if she gets it
from you, with all that poison
that's floatin' around?

18:41.920 --> 18:46.425
Kids. You think
you can protect'em,
but you can't.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.545
As the rainy season
approaches,

18:50.045 --> 18:52.047
the chimps will alter
their eating habits.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.049
You watchin'
that nature shit again?
Hey.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.051
What are you doing here
so late?

18:56.552 --> 19:00.055
My kid stepped on a nail.
Had to get him a shot.
Where is he?

19:00.055 --> 19:02.057
The emergency room
with carmela.

19:02.307 --> 19:06.311
So, uh, whatever happened
with the jew at the motel?

19:06.695 --> 19:10.199
We reached out to him,
he wasn't receptive,
they're going back.

19:13.702 --> 19:17.206
Want me to leave?
No problem. Just looking
for my nurse's pen.

19:17.206 --> 19:20.709
Uh, i think you got
the wrong room there, hon,
'cause you are not my nurse.

19:21.210 --> 19:22.711
I know,
but i made up the bed.

19:23.212 --> 19:26.215
No, sweetheart,
i have not been out
of this bed all day.

19:27.216 --> 19:29.718
I'm sorry.
I just need to check
some vitals.

19:29.718 --> 19:32.721
Hey, what are you doin'?
Hmm. That seems
to be working fine.

19:33.222 --> 19:36.225
Look at these flowers.
Nobody sends flower arrangements
like new york.

19:36.725 --> 19:39.228
Let me just check his--

19:39.728 --> 19:43.732
this--
this damn-- this damn i. V.

19:43.732 --> 19:48.103
Damn-- i got it.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.356
Oh.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.243
- I seem to be having
a problem here. -

19:54.243 --> 19:58.113
- do you mind if i borrow
one of your gowns?
-

19:58.113 --> 20:00.365
it's okay.
It's a private party.

20:01.617 --> 20:05.871
Thank you. Thank you.
Have a nice night.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.123
Oh, maron.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.509
Oh!

20:11.627 --> 20:13.629
Ahh!

20:15.380 --> 20:20.269
I got you, you prick!
You shoulda seen your face!
You shoulda seen your face!

20:20.269 --> 20:23.889
You prick!
"I ain't been out of bed
all day, honey."

20:23.889 --> 20:26.141
- Look at your face.
- Wha-- who the hell is this?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.644
Relax, mr. Aprile.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.146
It's time
for your sponge bath.

20:36.151 --> 20:40.789
She's a friend of mine
from the club.
Nice girl.

20:40.789 --> 20:44.793
I joined'em later on.
We got a little booze.
You know.

20:47.796 --> 20:50.299
That was nice of you
to have a party
for your friend.

20:50.799 --> 20:52.301
Yeah.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.309
Tufts medical school.

21:00.309 --> 21:02.177
Mm- hmm.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.183
You're a doctor.
What do you think?

21:08.317 --> 21:10.319
About jackie.

21:10.319 --> 21:13.322
I'd have to know more
about his condition.

21:13.322 --> 21:16.325
I told you
about his condition.
He's got cancer.

21:16.325 --> 21:19.444
- What kind of cancer?
- It's in the intestines.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.448
There was a tumor,
and they took it out.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.450
That's recurred.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.087
But you said he might go home.
They're not operating?

21:30.088 --> 21:32.090
It's next to
somethin' vital.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.459
- I see.
- You see.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.714
- From what you're telling me,
it doesn't sound very good.
- From what i'm telling you.

21:38.714 --> 21:42.217
- What the fuck do i know?
I'm not a doctor.
- You're angry. Who with?

21:42.217 --> 21:44.102
Let me tell you somethin'.

21:44.603 --> 21:47.606
This man has had chemo every day
for three fuckin' weeks,

21:47.606 --> 21:50.609
and he still has
every last hair on his head.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.612
Every last hair on his head,
and he's got
a beautiful head of hair.

21:53.612 --> 21:56.615
So don't tell me how it sounds,
'cause you don't know him,
you don't know me...

21:56.615 --> 21:59.618
and you don't know
what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

21:59.618 --> 22:04.239
We're getting closer to you
confronting your true feelings
about what's going on here.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.242
Wait a minute.
I just told you
my true feelings.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.244
You tell me
what's really goin' on.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.247
The tree in the painting.
Rotted out, you said.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.249
There's nothing in that picture
to indicate that.

22:14.750 --> 22:19.388
The fuckin' painting--
i knew that painting
was a fuckin' scam!

22:19.388 --> 22:21.390
You remember your dream?

22:21.640 --> 22:23.642
The ducks?

22:23.642 --> 22:25.644
It took on
another meaning.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.648
What happens to a tree
that's rotted out?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.767
Trees, ducks.
What the fuck are you,
ranger rick?

22:32.267 --> 22:33.769
Some job
you shrinks got.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.522
You think everybody's
lying to you while you're
pullin' scams on them!

22:37.522 --> 22:40.025
Fuck you!

22:42.444 --> 22:44.446
Uh- huh.
There's 37 definites.

22:44.446 --> 22:48.950
We got another 13 maybes,
plus the whole
pediatric hospital board.

22:49.951 --> 22:53.455
Right.
Are you sure we ordered
enough champagne?

22:54.456 --> 22:56.458
Right.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.461
Jean says they
shouldn't be too sober
for the silent auction.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.714
If anyone ever finds out
you got this from me--

23:02.714 --> 23:04.716
yes!
Look at me.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.718
This is no joke.

23:06.718 --> 23:10.222
You and me don't always
get along, but i don't think
you want to see me dead.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.225
I gotta call hunter.
You're the best.
Hey. I'm serious.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.227
Just this once.
Okay?

23:15.227 --> 23:18.230
I'm no drug dealer.
I just don't want to see you
get poisoned.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.232
You father
ever finds out--

23:20.232 --> 23:22.734
god, doesn't anyone
ever knock?

23:22.734 --> 23:26.238
Look, tell brendan
that hunter would rather die
than go out with him.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.240
Brendan?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.243
Keep that asshole
away from that child.
You understand me?

23:31.243 --> 23:35.247
The guy asked me to
do him a favor, i did it.
You delivered the message.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.249
Now let meadow study.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.256
Two goombahs from
the old neighborhood.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.759
What, they think they're
gonna name the soprano wing
in the new hospital...

23:48.260 --> 23:49.761
with the bulletproof glass
and the--

23:50.262 --> 23:51.763
you're just jealous
of their money.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.765
Me?
Yeah.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.767
Okay,
but explain to me this:

23:56.268 --> 23:58.770
The guy offers us
two tickets to the caribbean
out of pure friendship for me,

23:59.271 --> 24:01.773
you won't take'em
'cause they're tainted.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.659
But for some snob- ass party,
it's all right i take his money
to clean his toilets.

24:04.659 --> 24:08.914
First of all, arthur,
this is a paying job
and not some cruise.

24:08.914 --> 24:11.416
And why do you always
have to exaggerate?

24:11.416 --> 24:13.919
You're not cleaning his toilets.
You're a chef.

24:13.919 --> 24:15.921
Good.

24:15.921 --> 24:19.424
So you don't mind
that he fronts me some money for
a new place, 'cause he offered.

24:20.926 --> 24:23.428
Look at that face.

24:23.428 --> 24:27.432
Oh, god, arthur, don't tell me
that you took money
from tony soprano.

24:27.432 --> 24:29.935
How is it different?
Howis it different?

24:29.935 --> 24:32.938
I'm a chef.
I need a place to cook.
How?

24:32.938 --> 24:35.440
I'm giving carmela my support,
that's how.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.442
And it's for
a very reputable cause.

24:37.442 --> 24:39.945
But to have
that man as a partner--

24:39.945 --> 24:41.947
trust me, artie,
that would be insane.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.949
It would mean
the end of everything.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.951
At least
he made the gesture.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.955
Name me another fuckin' person
who offered us anything
except the sopranos.

24:50.205 --> 24:53.208
You wanna watch
what you're doin'?
You're squeezin' the quail.

25:04.052 --> 25:08.557
Do you like the food?
I was so busy schmoozing,
i barely had a bite.

25:08.557 --> 25:12.310
You are not gonna miss
those little veal "tonatas."
Charmaine!

25:14.312 --> 25:15.814
Charmaine!

25:23.588 --> 25:26.575
Not in the car!
Please, not in the car!
Shut up!

25:26.575 --> 25:28.577
Let me go,
you sons of--
shut up!

25:29.077 --> 25:31.780
Get in that fuckin' car!
Get in there, you--
no!

25:31.780 --> 25:34.783
You miserable
fuckin--

25:40.839 --> 25:43.842
i can't get used to havin'
all these strangers
in my house.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.595
Why'd you invite them?

25:49.347 --> 25:51.349
Try one of these.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.471
You're a fuckin' great cook,
artie.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.356
I cook like this,

25:59.858 --> 26:02.611
it reminds me
of what i lost.

26:03.612 --> 26:05.614
Havin' my restaurant
ripped from me--

26:05.614 --> 26:07.616
i can't tell ya.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.485
It was like losin' a limb.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.739
Sometimes i lay
in bed at night--
okay, enough already.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.126
Why don't you
forget about the past.
Look to the future.

26:18.126 --> 26:20.629
I am sick of hearin'
about your fuckin'
restaurant.

26:20.629 --> 26:22.881
Shut up about it,
you depressin' fuckin' jerk.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.250
What the fuck
do you know about it?

26:26.384 --> 26:28.637
Don't--
you motherfucker.

26:36.144 --> 26:38.146
Uh- huh.
You fuckin' jerk!

26:38.647 --> 26:40.649
Come on.
Give it up.

26:45.654 --> 26:47.656
See what you get?

26:49.658 --> 26:52.027
You fuckin' son of a bitch.

26:53.528 --> 26:55.530
Get up,
you stubborn fuck.
Please!

26:56.031 --> 26:57.532
Too late for pleases,
you stupid fuck.

26:58.033 --> 27:01.036
All this because you won't
say "yes" to a divorce?
It's not that simple!

27:01.536 --> 27:05.040
Why not?
You sign your fuckin' name
to a piece of paper.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.543
I don't like you.
Yeah? Well, i don't like you.
How's that?

27:08.543 --> 27:11.429
- You believe this prick?
-
what do i get, huh?

27:11.429 --> 27:14.432
You work for nothing?
I don't think so!

27:14.432 --> 27:16.935
I say we force- feed him
his sombrero.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.937
She wants to go to israel,
i send her.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.939
She wants something done
to her body, i pay.

27:20.939 --> 27:23.942
I feed her, clothe her,
put a roof over her head.

27:23.942 --> 27:26.945
On top of that, i work
for her father for 20 years
and put up with his abuse.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.948
I should walk away
without a nickel?
That's it. Stand up.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.950
We don't care.
Tough fuckin' luck.

27:31.950 --> 27:35.570
Aaah, you fucker!

27:35.570 --> 27:38.073
Silvio!

27:43.578 --> 27:45.580
Motherfucker.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.582
This guy's a bull.

27:47.582 --> 27:51.586
Paulie, if we don't
kill this prick,

27:51.586 --> 27:53.588
we should put him
to work.

27:53.588 --> 27:56.091
Yaaah- oooh!

27:59.094 --> 28:01.096
Time's a- wastin'.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.599
You're lucky
i could get out at all
with that party tonight.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.605
Shit!

28:16.111 --> 28:18.113
Hello.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.616
Tony, sorry
to bother you down there.

28:21.616 --> 28:26.121
This thing isn't working out
the way we'd hoped with our
friend with the funny sideburns.

28:26.121 --> 28:29.124
Don't say no more
on the phone--

28:29.124 --> 28:31.626
i'm comin' down.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.628
Shit!

28:33.628 --> 28:36.131
I gotta go.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.135
You just gotten here.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.637
Hey, i know.
But i gotta go.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.901
What's that painting
mean to you?

28:59.404 --> 29:02.907
Nothing. I just reminds me
of david hockey.

29:21.059 --> 29:24.429
You want somethin'
to munch on?

29:24.429 --> 29:26.431
What, are you
fuckin' kidding me?

29:26.931 --> 29:30.435
You know, most guys i know
would be happy to get rid
of their wife.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.687
I tried explainin'
the realities here.

29:32.687 --> 29:35.690
This guy's as stubborn
as a fuckin' mule.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.193
He says it's principle.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.195
I think we gotta--
you know.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.197
That's why
we called you.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.199
I promised
the father- in- law
i wouldn't.

29:44.699 --> 29:47.202
I didn't know
what else to do.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.708
You're a stupid motherfucker.
You know that?

29:53.708 --> 29:55.710
I've heard it said.

29:55.710 --> 29:57.712
What,
are you proud of it?

29:57.712 --> 30:02.717
You kill me,
and a dark cloud
goes over shlomo's house.

30:02.717 --> 30:07.222
Either way,
there'll be no get
unless restitution is made.

30:07.222 --> 30:11.226
You really would let me
kill you, wouldn't you,
you sick fuck?

30:13.228 --> 30:15.230
You ever heard
of the masada?

30:16.231 --> 30:17.732
For two years...

30:18.233 --> 30:20.235
900 jews
held their own...

30:20.235 --> 30:23.738
against 15, 000
roman soldiers.

30:24.739 --> 30:27.742
They chose death
before enslavement.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.246
And the romans,
where are they now?

30:32.247 --> 30:35.250
You're lookin' at'em,
asshole.

30:39.254 --> 30:43.258
"Yea, though i walk
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

30:43.258 --> 30:46.261
i fear no evil,
for thou art with me."

30:46.261 --> 30:48.263
Yeah. Hold that thought.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.110
Yeah?
Hesh.

31:02.110 --> 31:06.114
I'm here with my
non- shellfish- eatin' friend,
and i'm tapped out.

31:06.114 --> 31:09.117
This guy won't
listen to reason.

31:09.117 --> 31:13.121
Didn't i tell ya, huh?
Didn't i warn you to keep
away from those fanatics?

31:13.121 --> 31:17.625
He's leavin' me no options.
This man's willing
to go down with the ship.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.628
Well, here's a thought.

31:20.628 --> 31:23.631
Maybe he's willing to go
to the world to come,

31:23.631 --> 31:26.634
but if he's stuck here
on this earth...

31:26.634 --> 31:29.637
i know one thing
that no man wants
to go through life without.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.639
What?

31:32.140 --> 31:34.142
Oh.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.644
That's a fuckin'
brilliant idea.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.147
Make like amohel, huh?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.149
Finish his bris.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.151
Yeah.

31:44.152 --> 31:48.156
Paulie, get the bolt cutters
from out of the trunk.

31:48.156 --> 31:51.159
Ariel,
we're goin' to plan "b."

31:51.292 --> 31:53.795
The phone has been ringing
all morning.

31:53.795 --> 31:56.798
The rotellis, the trillos--
he's got something to do
with computers.

31:56.798 --> 31:59.801
They're a wonderful couple.
She invited us to brunch.

32:00.301 --> 32:02.303
Really?
Yep.

32:02.303 --> 32:04.305
But it was the food,
mainie.

32:04.806 --> 32:06.307
Everybody raved about it.

32:06.307 --> 32:09.310
Cynthia ricci said,
"oh, i just love those
little rice balls,"

32:09.310 --> 32:11.813
like she never had
arancin' before.

32:13.314 --> 32:15.817
I couldn't have done it
without you.

32:15.817 --> 32:21.322
It meant so much
just having you here.
It made it so much fun for me.

32:21.322 --> 32:24.325
Mainie, is somethin' wrong?
You got somethin' on your mind
or somethin'?

32:24.826 --> 32:26.828
What could be wrong?

32:27.829 --> 32:29.831
Listen, sweetie,

32:29.831 --> 32:34.335
i know it may not seem like it
right now, but you guys'll
get back on your feet again.

32:34.335 --> 32:37.839
Carmela,
i'm fine where i am.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.842
I know.
That's not what i meant, i--

32:41.209 --> 32:44.712
carmela, i never wanted
to tell you this.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.714
It happened
so long ago.

32:47.098 --> 32:50.101
You and tony,
you weren't even married.

32:50.101 --> 32:54.105
- It's probably silly for me
to even bring it up now.
- What?

32:56.107 --> 33:00.111
You were down at the shore
with your parents that summer.
You and tony were on the outs.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.613
- He called me.
- He did?

33:02.613 --> 33:06.617
One thing led to another,
we started dating each other--

33:06.617 --> 33:09.120
carmela, i slept with him.

33:10.621 --> 33:12.623
You slept with t--
with tony?

33:12.623 --> 33:16.127
Really, it wasn't for me.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.629
Carmela,
what i'm trying to say is,

33:18.629 --> 33:20.631
stop worrying about me.

33:20.631 --> 33:23.634
Really.
We both made our choices.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.636
I'm fine with mine.

33:44.405 --> 33:48.910
I'd like you to consider this.
I'm disgusted with you.
Don't try to give me that.

33:48.910 --> 33:52.914
Why'd you page me?
This fuckin' guy's tryin'
to pull some bullshit, tony.

33:52.914 --> 33:55.917
Hey, zz top.
The guy gave you
the get, didn't he?

33:55.917 --> 33:57.919
But not because of you.

33:57.919 --> 33:59.921
You threatened him
with castration,

33:59.921 --> 34:02.924
but it was business
that brought him around.

34:02.924 --> 34:06.427
He wanted 50 percent,
you wanted 25 percent,
so i split the difference.

34:06.928 --> 34:10.931
I gave him 15 percent,
he gives my daughter
the divorce, and, uh--

34:11.431 --> 34:12.934
it's business.
It worked out.

34:13.434 --> 34:14.936
Walk with me,"shmolo."
Yes.

34:15.436 --> 34:16.938
Listen, don't worry.

34:17.438 --> 34:19.940
I- i've taken
good care of you.
Here.

34:19.940 --> 34:22.944
W- what's that?
For your considerable
trouble.

34:23.444 --> 34:25.446
As the talmud says--

34:26.447 --> 34:28.949
i don't give a shit
what he says.

34:28.949 --> 34:30.952
Now you listen to me.

34:30.952 --> 34:33.955
You wanna give
your son- in- law 15 percent
of the motel? Go ahead.

34:33.955 --> 34:35.956
It comes out
of your end.

34:35.956 --> 34:39.460
Now, we got you your get,
you get us our 25 percent.
Got it?

34:39.460 --> 34:41.462
My son was right.
Yeah?

34:41.462 --> 34:43.965
You're mud,
godless clay--

34:45.967 --> 34:48.469
i created
a living golem!

34:48.469 --> 34:50.471
What the fuck
is a golem?

34:50.471 --> 34:52.473
It's a monster!
Frankenstein!

34:52.473 --> 34:54.475
Get the fuck outta here,

34:54.475 --> 34:57.478
before i take
that asshole son of yours
and shove him up your ass!

34:57.478 --> 34:59.981
Shut up!

35:11.242 --> 35:13.244
Hey.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.746
Hey, how ya doin'?

35:16.247 --> 35:18.249
One second.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.371
Got some good news.
We're in the motel business.

35:23.871 --> 35:25.873
How do you like that?

35:31.512 --> 35:33.514
Read this.

35:37.018 --> 35:39.020
102. 7.

35:40.521 --> 35:43.524
Maybe they should
take my temperature
with the other machine.

35:44.025 --> 35:48.146
- Paulie thinks he broke
his hand on the guy's head.
- Digital.

35:48.279 --> 35:51.782
- We're threatening
to cut his dick off.
- I should call the nurse.

35:51.899 --> 35:54.902
He's mumblin' and prayin',
i'm tryin' to get
his pants off--

35:55.153 --> 35:57.155
i think they should
take my temperature again.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.907
Yeah, yeah, call'em.

36:18.809 --> 36:20.811
Poor jackie.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.815
God has his reasons.

36:25.316 --> 36:27.935
Livia, he looked
twice as old as me.

36:27.935 --> 36:30.938
So, what's really
on your mind, corrado?

36:31.439 --> 36:33.941
This christopher moltisanti.

36:33.941 --> 36:36.827
Christopher.
What about him?

36:37.078 --> 36:39.580
Him and his little,
uh,"friend,"

36:39.580 --> 36:42.083
they're slappin' me
in the face...

36:42.083 --> 36:44.085
and they're hiding
behind tony.

36:44.085 --> 36:48.089
Well, tony always
loved christopher like a son,

36:48.589 --> 36:50.591
and so do i, junior.

36:51.092 --> 36:54.095
He put up my storm windows
for me one year.

36:56.097 --> 36:58.099
Good.

37:03.604 --> 37:05.606
But what do i do?

37:05.606 --> 37:09.610
I just let him
and this filone kid
piss on me in public?

37:09.610 --> 37:11.612
And how far do i go...

37:11.612 --> 37:15.116
before i light a friggin' match
under that hotheaded son
of yours?

37:17.618 --> 37:21.122
Maybe christopher
could use a little talking to.

37:21.122 --> 37:23.624
You know.

37:23.624 --> 37:27.128
The other one, filone...

37:32.633 --> 37:34.635
i don't know.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.511
You got a lot of sense
for an old gal.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.513
No.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.015
I'm a babbling idiot.

37:48.015 --> 37:51.519
That's why my son
put me in a nursing home.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.990
He didn't even care
i was there.

37:57.491 --> 38:00.494
It was just him
and that fuckin' cancer.

38:03.998 --> 38:06.000
It's like
he's already gone.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.002
Yes.

38:11.005 --> 38:13.007
Ehh.

38:17.511 --> 38:20.014
Somebody called me
a frankenstein today.

38:20.014 --> 38:22.016
Really?

38:22.016 --> 38:24.518
This hasid
i'm doin' business with.

38:25.519 --> 38:28.522
These hasids,
they're out there,

38:29.023 --> 38:31.525
but they got their beliefs,
you know.

38:33.027 --> 38:35.029
They're not afraid
of death.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.647
At least
this one guy wasn't.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.151
Maybe they have the belief
because they are afraid.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.653
I'm not afraid of death.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.655
Not if it's...

38:44.655 --> 38:46.657
for somethin'.

38:46.657 --> 38:49.660
You know, a war,
somethin' like that.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.662
A reason.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.664
But jackie--

38:53.664 --> 38:55.666
to see this--

38:55.666 --> 38:59.670
this strong,
beautiful man...

39:01.672 --> 39:03.674
just wither away
to nothin'.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.182
And you can't do nothin'
about it.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.184
And you--

39:13.184 --> 39:15.186
you can't fight it.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.189
Do you envy the hasids
and their beliefs?

39:18.689 --> 39:20.691
All this shit's for nothin'.

39:23.694 --> 39:27.198
And if all this shit's
for nothin',
why do i gotta think about it?

39:27.198 --> 39:29.200
That's the mystery,
isn't it?

39:31.202 --> 39:35.206
The mystery of god,
or whatever
you want to call it,

39:35.206 --> 39:41.212
of why we're given
the questionable gift
of knowing we're gonna die.

39:49.353 --> 39:52.223
Do you feel
like frankenstein?

39:55.109 --> 39:57.111
A thing...

39:57.111 --> 39:59.864
lacking humanity,

39:59.864 --> 40:02.867
lacking human feelings?

40:38.652 --> 40:40.654
Say hello to freddy,
all right?

40:49.663 --> 40:51.665
You fuck--

41:13.804 --> 41:15.806

of tony's, right?

41:16.307 --> 41:17.808
Listen, meadow

41:18.309 --> 41:21.812
If i didn't get it to her,

jefferson avenue!

41:22.313 --> 41:25.065

They woulda raped her!

41:25.065 --> 41:27.067
I don't wanna die now!

41:27.067 --> 41:30.571
I didn't mean it!
I am sorry!

41:30.571 --> 41:33.574
Listen to me!

41:34.074 --> 41:36.327

41:36.327 --> 41:38.329
No, we don't.
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot!

41:55.980 --> 41:58.732
