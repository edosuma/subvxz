WEBVTT

00:00.843 --> 00:02.176
Previously on Empire...

00:02.177 --> 00:05.135
We got one shot to put
this bitch down for good.

00:05.136 --> 00:06.591
We have a warrant for your arrest

00:06.592 --> 00:07.761
in the kidnapping of Bella Lyon.

00:07.762 --> 00:08.818
Please don't take my baby.

00:08.818 --> 00:09.818
You will no longer use her

00:09.820 --> 00:11.178
to get to me, or my family.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.847
This is how it ends.

00:12.848 --> 00:14.382
No! Jamal!

00:17.052 --> 00:19.487
No.

00:19.488 --> 00:21.489
There's been a shooting.
I think someone is dead.

00:21.490 --> 00:23.291
Something going on with
the hormones, mama?

00:23.292 --> 00:24.592
Who's the lucky daddy?

00:25.193 --> 00:26.294
I love you.

00:28.397 --> 00:31.866
I really think we should
take our time this goround.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.536
Your son had a psychotic break.

00:35.537 --> 00:37.938
I need you to come back
stronger than ever.

00:39.608 --> 00:41.208
Claudia.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.978
My sweet, sweet Dwight.

00:48.181 --> 00:49.511
What are we supposed to do now?

00:49.512 --> 00:51.113
Just act like everything is normal?

00:51.114 --> 00:54.583
Baby, look, we just gonna start
putting this behind us, okay?

00:54.584 --> 00:56.718
How does that work? Putting
behind you killing somebody?

00:56.719 --> 00:59.588
Look, I don't want to...
hear no more about this.

00:59.589 --> 01:02.257
You did everything in your
power to save a life.

01:03.893 --> 01:05.126
And what about Angelo?

01:05.128 --> 01:06.628
You were acting in
selfdefense, Jamal.

01:06.629 --> 01:08.096
What you did was heroic.

01:08.097 --> 01:10.632
Look, I don't have no
answers for Angelo.

01:10.633 --> 01:13.135
All I know is I'm standing
here with my baby,

01:13.136 --> 01:14.121
and not burying him.

01:14.122 --> 01:15.855
And that's all I care about.

01:15.856 --> 01:18.224
Look, try to get some rest, okay?

01:18.225 --> 01:21.194
Yeah.

01:23.397 --> 01:25.098
Something's wrong, Thirsty.

01:25.099 --> 01:27.667
Look, they are never gonna press
charges, all right? Warren gave

01:27.668 --> 01:29.502
a full account of the attack.
Jamal is in the clear.

01:29.503 --> 01:31.604
- Don't fret.
- I can't find Lucious.

01:31.605 --> 01:33.373
What, he... What do you mean?

01:33.374 --> 01:35.608
He was supposed to come
to the house last night;

01:35.609 --> 01:37.076
He never made it.

01:37.077 --> 01:39.312
I just got that message.

01:39.313 --> 01:42.015
"Going away for a while. I need
some quality time by myself."

01:42.016 --> 01:44.350
- "Quality time"?
- Does that sound like Lucious to you?

01:44.351 --> 01:45.518
No.

01:45.519 --> 01:46.986
Okay. Look, let me see

01:46.987 --> 01:48.521
what I can find out, okay?
DDon't worry.

01:48.522 --> 01:50.890
I'll call you when I got something.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.831
Dwight?

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.342 --> 02:10.310
Dwight?

02:10.311 --> 02:12.245
Can you hear me?

02:15.115 --> 02:16.816
Hello?

02:20.020 --> 02:22.655
Take it easy.

02:22.656 --> 02:24.657
What did you do to me?

02:24.658 --> 02:27.360
You just still have a little of
the sedative in your system.

02:27.361 --> 02:29.662
Take it...

02:32.166 --> 02:33.333
Dwight...

02:33.334 --> 02:35.335
just take it easy, be careful.

02:35.336 --> 02:36.669
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

02:36.670 --> 02:39.072
You... look, you've
mastered your prosthetic,

02:39.073 --> 02:41.407
but your other leg is
chained to the piano.

02:41.408 --> 02:46.079
Do... you know who...

02:46.080 --> 02:47.614
I am?

02:49.283 --> 02:51.217
Do you know what I will do to you?

02:51.218 --> 02:54.954
Do you know the kind of pain
that I'ma bring on your head?!

02:59.260 --> 03:01.594
We can discuss this

03:01.595 --> 03:04.697
when you've had a
little bit more rest.

03:10.070 --> 03:12.672
What'd you do to me?

03:23.384 --> 03:25.051
I know who you are.

03:25.052 --> 03:28.588
And I know exactly what I'm doing.

03:35.596 --> 03:38.031
So, we doing this, or what?

03:39.233 --> 03:40.566
Man...

03:44.838 --> 03:46.940
Hey, look, bitches, don't play me.

03:46.941 --> 03:50.076
If you're with me, then we gonna
hit hard and we gonna hit fast

03:50.077 --> 03:51.578
until that man bleeds.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.179
So are we together or what?

03:53.180 --> 03:54.480
Yeah, yeah.

03:55.616 --> 03:57.116
We doing this.

03:57.117 --> 03:59.552
- A'ight. We in.
- Yeah.

03:59.553 --> 04:02.288
Good. Okay, so I say
we hit after chow.

04:02.289 --> 04:05.925
It's only him and two other
guards on the stroll.

04:07.895 --> 04:10.663
We need to distract them, so
Chyna, Tam, that's on you.

04:10.664 --> 04:12.165
You always cheat.

04:12.166 --> 04:13.199
Bitch, why you tripping?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.300
Hey, sit down.

04:14.301 --> 04:15.768
Sit down! Get in your seat!

04:16.904 --> 04:18.870
And that's when me and
Poundcake go to work.

04:18.872 --> 04:22.208
- You know it.
- Poundcake gonna tenderize his ass.

04:22.209 --> 04:24.377
I'm gonna cut him a buck 50.

04:24.378 --> 04:26.813
Then if I get close enough...

04:32.019 --> 04:35.888
I got a few choice words
for his raping ass.

04:35.889 --> 04:37.490
Sit down! Hey, sit down!

04:37.491 --> 04:38.658
Quiet down!

04:38.659 --> 04:39.959
Quiet down! Sit down!

04:39.960 --> 04:43.463
- Get in your seats!
- Move back, move back!

04:48.260 --> 04:50.336
Go, go, go! Get him!

04:50.337 --> 04:52.205
You, move back!

04:52.206 --> 04:53.639
You sick bastard.

04:55.042 --> 04:56.542
Not today, Cookie.

04:58.879 --> 04:59.979
Stop it!

05:01.148 --> 05:02.382
Stay down!

05:02.383 --> 05:03.750
Get off her!

05:05.219 --> 05:08.154
- Please, no more!
- Don't make me tell you again!

05:08.155 --> 05:09.422
She's got a blade.

05:12.026 --> 05:13.426
Settle down, inmates.
We're good.

05:13.427 --> 05:15.395
Throw her in the hole.

05:15.396 --> 05:16.696
Three weeks ought to cool her off.

05:16.697 --> 05:18.297
Come on, get her up.

05:18.298 --> 05:20.299
Playtime's over. Back to your cells.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.135
All right, the show's over.

05:22.136 --> 05:25.238
Back up, inmate.

05:25.239 --> 05:27.907
This is what you get.

05:27.908 --> 05:30.943
On the gate.

05:35.516 --> 05:37.288
Hey, Cook.

05:37.289 --> 05:38.923
Hey, what you got for me?

05:38.924 --> 05:41.726
Well, it so happens,
my cousin is an orderly

05:41.727 --> 05:43.561
at the Parkway Institution.

05:44.897 --> 05:46.664
That's where Andre's admitted.

05:46.665 --> 05:48.666
Yeah.

05:48.667 --> 05:51.769
And it's also the last spot
where Lucious was seen.

05:51.770 --> 05:54.172
He went to go visit Andre.

05:54.173 --> 05:56.507
This is the feed from
the security cameras

05:56.508 --> 05:59.944
around the same time he was there.

06:01.847 --> 06:04.148
Wait for it.

06:07.319 --> 06:09.354
Booyah.

06:09.355 --> 06:10.622
Claudia?

06:10.623 --> 06:11.823
Well, does she work there?

06:11.824 --> 06:12.924
No, not at all.

06:12.925 --> 06:14.392
Looklook, I got to ask.

06:14.393 --> 06:16.427
Do you think there might
be a chance he relapsed?

06:16.428 --> 06:19.297
Maybe went a little soft in
the brain, gave her a call?

06:19.298 --> 06:20.999
Do you think that's what he meant

06:21.000 --> 06:23.134
by he "needed time alone"?

06:23.135 --> 06:25.103
- You think he needed her again?
- I don't know,

06:25.104 --> 06:26.671
it's hard to say. You know,
are we talking Lucious,

06:26.672 --> 06:27.905
or we talking Dwight?

06:27.906 --> 06:29.641
I mean, best we can do is ask Claudia,

06:29.642 --> 06:31.542
but therein lies the rub.

06:31.543 --> 06:32.977
This chick is off the grid.

06:32.978 --> 06:35.213
I can't reach her at
any of her numbers.

06:35.214 --> 06:38.449
What about that doctor who
vouched for her? Gloria...

06:38.450 --> 06:40.351
- Gloria Rothman. Yeah, she's on my list.
- Yeah.

06:40.352 --> 06:42.453
I'll reach out to her, give
her the ol' "what's up, Doc?"

06:42.454 --> 06:44.956
I mean, she's got to know something.

06:44.957 --> 06:46.190
I'll get back to you.

06:46.191 --> 06:48.326
Thirsty.

06:48.327 --> 06:49.994
Find him.

06:49.995 --> 06:51.396
Yeah, we will.

06:51.397 --> 06:54.499
Stay strong, Cook.

07:05.177 --> 07:08.846
I really wish you wouldn't fight this.

07:08.847 --> 07:11.215
Why you doing this?

07:11.216 --> 07:13.117
You know? What,
is it some money you need?

07:13.118 --> 07:14.819
Is it, is it... is this

07:14.820 --> 07:16.788
some kind of a ransom thing

07:16.789 --> 07:18.122
you want to do with me right now?

07:18.123 --> 07:20.325
You know me better than that.

07:20.326 --> 07:22.093
I want Dwight.

07:22.094 --> 07:24.095
I don't know him no more.

07:24.096 --> 07:25.763
I don't believe that.

07:25.764 --> 07:27.999
When we were together, you were kind

07:28.000 --> 07:29.701
and creative and brave.

07:29.702 --> 07:33.571
And now you're just lost,
and so full of rage.

07:33.572 --> 07:35.340
That's not who you are, Dwight.

07:35.341 --> 07:37.742
Bitch, you better
stop calling me that!

07:37.743 --> 07:40.945
My name is Lucious Lyon!

07:40.946 --> 07:45.216
Your trauma is so deep.

07:49.254 --> 07:52.223
But I know what that's like.

07:52.224 --> 07:57.028
To have to shut down a part
of yourself to survive?

08:00.933 --> 08:03.234
But you are Dwight.

08:03.235 --> 08:05.903
And we'll get him back, together.

08:05.904 --> 08:09.507
Even if we have to
kill Lucious to do it.

08:13.885 --> 08:15.318
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:15.319 --> 08:17.866
dropping this Tuesday
on Empire XStream

08:17.867 --> 08:20.135
is one of Empire's rising stars,

08:20.136 --> 08:23.605
performing live at
Laviticus, Tory Ash!

08:38.320 --> 08:40.155
- Becky.
- Hey.

08:40.155 --> 08:41.655
Cookie don't want Tory Ash doing

08:41.657 --> 08:43.758
no interviews with all
this Dubois mess going on.

08:43.759 --> 08:45.527
Of course. We only have every reporter

08:45.528 --> 08:47.162
from every media
outlet in the country.

08:47.163 --> 08:49.664
Who wouldn't want a
scoop on manslaughter?

08:49.665 --> 08:51.332
Yo, don't shoot the messenger.
I'm just telling you

08:51.333 --> 08:52.534
- what she told me.
- It's just...

08:52.535 --> 08:54.502
where is Lucious?

09:07.550 --> 09:08.883
He's the only one that can spin this.

09:08.884 --> 09:10.885
He got one son at the police station,

09:10.886 --> 09:12.887
and another son in the crazy house.

09:12.888 --> 09:15.056
Lucious got enough on his plate.

09:15.057 --> 09:17.692
This family loves drama. Look,
hold this. I'ma go pee.

10:03.172 --> 10:04.339
Excuse me, Cookie.

10:04.340 --> 10:06.341
I got the doc.

10:10.746 --> 10:13.548
Dr. Rothman was kind enough
to come in and talk with us.

10:13.549 --> 10:14.649
Thank you for coming.

10:14.650 --> 10:16.584
She's Claudia's therapist.

10:16.585 --> 10:18.786
Well, in our profession,
it's not uncommon

10:18.787 --> 10:21.856
for colleagues to function as
counselors for each other.

10:21.857 --> 10:23.958
Have a seat.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.728
Yeah, we were hoping
that you could,

10:26.729 --> 10:28.796
locate her.
We have a couple of questions.

10:28.797 --> 10:31.499
I haven't seen Claudia
for a few weeks now.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.134
I've been unable to reach her.

10:33.135 --> 10:34.903
Is... there something wrong?

10:34.904 --> 10:36.804
Look, Lucious Lyon is missing, okay?

10:36.805 --> 10:40.875
Andand security cameras
picked Claudia up lingering

10:40.876 --> 10:42.810
around the last place he was seen.

10:42.811 --> 10:47.849
So I'ma ask you this once,
and I'ma ask you nicely.

10:47.850 --> 10:51.085
Do I got to worry about this bitch?

10:52.321 --> 10:55.123
Um...

10:55.124 --> 10:57.992
Claudia has had her own
fair share of trauma.

10:57.993 --> 11:02.096
It's made her an ideal person
to help others, but...

11:02.097 --> 11:03.731
there have been times

11:03.732 --> 11:06.067
when she took her methods too far.

11:12.007 --> 11:14.275
Would you like to hear
about your curriculum?

11:14.276 --> 11:15.777
I was thinking that we would start

11:15.778 --> 11:18.346
with some of the sensory exercises

11:18.347 --> 11:20.682
that we did before. I'll just need you

11:20.683 --> 11:23.117
to be open and cooperative.

11:23.118 --> 11:26.287
Well, what if I don't feel like
being open and cooperative?

11:31.994 --> 11:35.196
I have this if you refuse medication,

11:35.197 --> 11:38.533
and this is for my safety.

11:38.534 --> 11:41.035
There was this Olympic track star.

11:41.036 --> 11:44.038
His team bus ran off
the road one night,

11:44.039 --> 11:45.440
but he survived.

11:45.441 --> 11:47.638
To help with his rehabilitation,

11:47.639 --> 11:49.277
Claudia moved in with the patient

11:49.278 --> 11:50.912
and his wife up in Westchester.

11:50.913 --> 11:54.482
The same damn thing she
did with me and Lucious.

11:54.483 --> 11:57.619
Well, his doctors could
not believe his recovery,

11:57.620 --> 12:01.222
but things took a turn
when his wife decided

12:01.223 --> 12:05.727
to discontinue some of Claudia's
more nontraditional techniques.

12:05.728 --> 12:08.396
- Okay, nontraditional?
- Yeah.

12:08.397 --> 12:10.498
She likes to get a
little too hands on.

12:10.499 --> 12:12.738
She thought it would be best

12:12.739 --> 12:15.002
to take him to a more
secluded environment upstate.

12:16.171 --> 12:18.039
Upstate? You have an address?

12:18.040 --> 12:19.607
I'm not sure.

12:19.608 --> 12:22.377
The wife intervened before
she was able to take him.

12:22.378 --> 12:23.811
II'm sorry.

12:23.812 --> 12:26.214
I really don't feel comfortable
saying anything more

12:26.215 --> 12:29.017
until I've had the chance to
talk to Claudia, but II will

12:29.018 --> 12:31.653
- continue to reach out to her.
- Thank you. -Yes. Please do.

12:31.654 --> 12:34.522
All right, and when you talk to
Claudia, I would like to know.

12:34.523 --> 12:36.491
Nontraditional treatment.

12:36.492 --> 12:37.892
- Upstate.
- Yeah.

12:42.031 --> 12:45.233
I don't know if you've seen it yet,

12:45.234 --> 12:46.901
but the sun came out.

12:46.902 --> 12:49.003
It keeps doing that.

12:49.004 --> 12:51.706
- Yo, man, what are you doing?
- Man, I don't like this, Mal.

12:51.707 --> 12:53.374
You're getting into fights.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.877
You're shouting at
people, like a punk.

12:55.878 --> 12:57.712
That's my gig, not you.

12:57.713 --> 13:00.281
Come on, man. I thought we were
like the princes of England.

13:00.282 --> 13:01.949
You were the stable one.

13:01.950 --> 13:04.786
What's his name? William?

13:04.787 --> 13:07.855
Did you know that when you
pull the trigger, it...

13:07.856 --> 13:09.924
it's like the gunpowder
just stays on you.

13:09.925 --> 13:12.627
No matter how much you wash it.

13:12.628 --> 13:15.697
It don't matter how many times
I tell myself that we were...

13:15.698 --> 13:17.965
we were both fighting for the gun.

13:19.101 --> 13:20.768
I can still feel myself...

13:22.104 --> 13:24.405
I can still feel it going off.

13:24.406 --> 13:27.375
Look, the Dubois came after
us with all they had.

13:27.376 --> 13:29.610
- We still survived.
- Did we?

13:29.611 --> 13:31.045
All of us.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.915
Get dressed.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.585
- Where are we going?
- We going out.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.719
Put your Guccis on.

13:47.761 --> 13:50.963
You know, you got a bladder
the size of a thimble.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.498
Why you got to tinkle all the time?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.633
Yo, how much I tinkle and when I do it

13:54.634 --> 13:55.801
is none of your business.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.002
That's between me and the toilet.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.104
You pregnant?

13:59.105 --> 14:00.472
What kind of question is that?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.107
Ain't that a pregnancy
test in your hand?

14:02.108 --> 14:04.810
Yeah, but these things don't
even mean anything, so...

14:04.811 --> 14:09.148
They're like 99.999% accurate.
They mean a lot. What's it say?

14:09.149 --> 14:13.018
- Can I wash my hands now, or...
- What does it say, Becky?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.486
You know, it really doesn't matter

14:14.487 --> 14:18.323
what it says because until
I see an actual doctor,

14:18.324 --> 14:20.692
every single one of
these are inconclusive.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.161
So...

14:22.162 --> 14:23.962
- And it's just not even...
- Damn, Becky!

14:23.963 --> 14:25.431
How many of those you done took?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.633
You got, like, a dozen tinkle tests.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.101
They positive?

14:29.102 --> 14:33.972
I... I, um...

14:33.973 --> 14:35.207
They positive.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.845
I... I need to wash my hands, okay?

14:39.846 --> 14:42.781
- Becky.
- No, I...

14:42.782 --> 14:46.952
It's okay.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.987
It's okay.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.356
I still didn't wash my hands.

14:51.357 --> 14:55.259
That's ok... I didn't wash
my hands, either. It's okay.

15:30.195 --> 15:31.362
Dwight?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.166
What's wrong?

15:36.702 --> 15:39.637
My whole life, I never felt safe.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.772
Even as a child.

15:41.773 --> 15:45.476
Except within the music.

15:45.477 --> 15:48.412
And being here in this cabin,

15:48.413 --> 15:51.749
it's like... the fog is lifting.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.084
I can...

15:53.085 --> 15:56.854
I can hear the music again.

15:57.890 --> 16:02.159
I should've never sent you away.

16:04.596 --> 16:07.431
It's okay.

16:07.432 --> 16:09.000
I'm here now.

16:12.070 --> 16:15.406
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

16:15.407 --> 16:16.407
I'm so sorry.

16:16.408 --> 16:18.042
It's all right.

16:18.043 --> 16:21.479
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

16:24.349 --> 16:25.650
Didn't I tell you?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.451
I told you to let me go, didn't I?

16:27.452 --> 16:30.087
You didn't want to listen to
me. You should've let me go.

16:30.088 --> 16:32.089
You should've let me go, shouldn't you?

16:34.426 --> 16:35.526
Aah!

16:38.797 --> 16:41.098
Aah!

16:53.879 --> 16:57.181
Aah! Stop! No!

16:59.851 --> 17:02.753
You shouldn't have done that.

17:02.754 --> 17:04.521
What did you do to me?

17:04.522 --> 17:08.492
Experimental medications
heightened your receptors.

17:08.492 --> 17:10.027
And with the synesthesia

17:10.028 --> 17:12.663
combined with the music and lights,

17:12.664 --> 17:14.265
it creates this intense pain.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.701
Something maybe a little
bit like a migraine.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.403
- That wasn't music.
- Yes, it is.

17:19.404 --> 17:22.673
That's all of your rap songs
layered over each other.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.343
That's what Lucious Lyon sounds like.

17:25.344 --> 17:28.279
Pain.

17:30.315 --> 17:34.952
Five minutes should be sufficient.

17:34.953 --> 17:38.489
No! No!

17:52.440 --> 17:54.914
Talk to me.

17:54.915 --> 17:56.916
Well, Claudia has never
owned any property upstate,

17:56.917 --> 17:58.618
but her father owned a house up there,

17:58.619 --> 18:00.186
and it's still listed under his name.

18:00.187 --> 18:01.654
Yeah, well that must be it.

18:01.655 --> 18:03.790
Text me the address. It
shouldn't be too far.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.691
All right, Cookie, maybe
you shouldn't do this.

18:05.692 --> 18:06.826
All right? The place
looks a little secluded.

18:06.827 --> 18:07.894
Don't know what you're walking into.

18:07.895 --> 18:08.995
Look, I'll finish with the police,

18:08.996 --> 18:10.663
- and I can head right over there.
- No. Look,

18:10.664 --> 18:14.734
if he's back to his old
Dwight self, I just...

18:14.735 --> 18:16.636
just want to have a mature
conversation with him.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.571
- That's all.
- Cookie, have you met you?

18:18.572 --> 18:20.106
All right, most of your
conversations usually involve

18:20.107 --> 18:22.408
a baseball bat and three
weeks of carpentry repairs.

18:22.409 --> 18:23.910
Get off my phone.

18:25.512 --> 18:26.946
You got this, Cook.

18:29.049 --> 18:30.983
You got this.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.253
You got this, Cook. You got this.

18:34.254 --> 18:36.823
You got this, Cook.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.157
You got this.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.926
Don't get up. It's just me.

18:39.927 --> 18:41.727
You busy?

18:41.728 --> 18:45.231
I thought you might be
interested in this.

18:45.232 --> 18:47.400
"Rising rap star, Lucious Lyon,

18:47.401 --> 18:49.969
attended The Source
Awards last night."

18:49.970 --> 18:51.938
He's a handsome fella.

18:51.939 --> 18:55.541
Might explain this supermodel
wrapped around him.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.114
Come on, look alive.
You got family here.

19:02.115 --> 19:04.617
Lucious. Lucious came.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.588
Lucious! My babies came to see me.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.495
I ain't got nothing
to say to you, bitch.

19:16.496 --> 19:19.532
Burleson told me that
I could see my baby

19:19.533 --> 19:21.868
and get an early leave if, you know,

19:21.869 --> 19:24.704
I just tipped him on anything
that was going down.

19:28.508 --> 19:31.444
But I didn't ask you for nothing,

19:31.445 --> 19:33.880
and I don't own you a damn thing.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.349
Yeah, that's right.

19:36.350 --> 19:38.818
You saved your baby all by yourself.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.955
Get the hell out of my face.

19:50.030 --> 19:52.398
You got no family inside,

19:52.399 --> 19:54.400
you got no family outside.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.235
I'm gonna break you.

19:56.236 --> 19:59.872
I'm gonna break you so you
have to crawl out of here.

20:10.350 --> 20:12.051
Did you let him know we were coming?

20:12.052 --> 20:14.420
I thought we'd surprise him.

20:19.192 --> 20:21.193
What are y'all doing here?

20:21.194 --> 20:22.728
You know I'm coming home in a week.

20:22.729 --> 20:24.397
We just thought we'd
came to check up on you

20:24.398 --> 20:25.398
before you came back.

20:25.399 --> 20:27.867
Is it okay to catch a hug or what?

20:37.377 --> 20:39.712
I heard about what happened. You okay?

20:39.713 --> 20:40.880
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:40.881 --> 20:43.382
Yeah, we're just looking
forward to you coming home.

20:43.383 --> 20:45.951
Whenever you're ready.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.223
Warren?

20:51.224 --> 20:52.792
He's fine.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.760
Lucky Mal was there
to take Angelo out.

20:54.761 --> 20:56.195
You know how stupid you sound

20:56.196 --> 20:57.263
saying something like that.

20:57.264 --> 20:58.264
What would you possibly know

20:58.265 --> 20:59.665
about taking somebody out, Hakeem?

21:00.567 --> 21:02.902
It's not some damn movie.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.643
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

21:10.644 --> 21:12.111
I shouldn't have come here. I...

21:12.112 --> 21:13.980
Jamal, you can't leave.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.048
We got to stick together.

21:19.052 --> 21:21.721
No, that woman,

21:21.722 --> 21:23.889
that woman, Diana,
she wanted to destroy us,

21:23.890 --> 21:25.758
and she did.

21:25.759 --> 21:27.560
She did, y'all.

21:27.561 --> 21:29.962
Look at what she did to you.

21:29.963 --> 21:31.964
And you and Bella and me.

21:31.965 --> 21:33.833
And her own flesh and blood.

21:33.834 --> 21:38.089
And now everybody's just
patting me on the back

21:38.090 --> 21:40.258
and I'm so pissed about that
'cause they're just like,

21:40.259 --> 21:43.227
"Good job. Good job."
But for what?

21:43.228 --> 21:45.396
Look, I ain't want to kill nobody.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.468
But I did.

21:52.404 --> 21:55.239
But I did!

21:55.240 --> 21:57.442
Jamal, it's okay.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.448
It's okay.

22:03.449 --> 22:05.883
No.

22:07.353 --> 22:09.420
Dre, man, I'm sorry.
I'm fine, all right?

22:09.421 --> 22:11.489
I'm really sorry.

22:13.225 --> 22:15.893
Jamal, you listen to me, all right?

22:18.197 --> 22:20.932
We all carry our burdens with us.

22:20.933 --> 22:24.569
You don't have to carry them alone.

22:24.570 --> 22:27.438
I'm with you.

22:27.439 --> 22:29.240
I'm with you, too.

22:31.310 --> 22:33.344
I'm with you, too.

23:05.844 --> 23:08.012
I didn't mean to hurt you.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.847
I know.

23:09.848 --> 23:11.683
You weren't yourself.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.292
It's Cookie.

23:21.293 --> 23:22.527
Cookie!

23:22.528 --> 23:24.028
I'm in here!

23:24.029 --> 23:28.833
You better get rid of her
or I will slit her throat.

23:28.834 --> 23:32.236
She will not interrupt me again.

24:09.475 --> 24:11.642
Hello, Cookie.

24:11.643 --> 24:13.211
Is Lucious here?

24:13.212 --> 24:16.547
Because if he is, I would like
to speak with him, please.

24:16.548 --> 24:18.482
Please.

24:38.437 --> 24:40.905
How'd you find us?

24:40.906 --> 24:43.941
Is there a reason why you're
not returning my phone calls?

24:43.942 --> 24:47.044
We had some very important
work to do alone.

24:47.045 --> 24:50.114
What's this "we," white wo...?

24:50.115 --> 24:51.115
You know what?

24:51.116 --> 24:53.184
You just...

24:56.588 --> 24:58.422
Talk to me.

24:58.423 --> 25:02.393
Ain't you got nothing better
to do than looking for me?

25:02.394 --> 25:03.928
I mean, yeah, you asked Lucious

25:03.929 --> 25:05.429
to help you to take down the Dubois.

25:05.430 --> 25:06.798
I did that, right?

25:06.799 --> 25:08.704
But there was a part of
me that was developed

25:08.705 --> 25:11.435
wwith Claudia thatthat
I need to flesh out.

25:11.436 --> 25:14.105
I don't know whether to
call it Lucious or Dwight,

25:14.106 --> 25:17.475
but whatever it is... I
want to be a better man.

25:27.386 --> 25:30.688
I don't know how this white
woman got you twisted,

25:30.689 --> 25:32.256
but we have a company to run.

25:32.257 --> 25:35.426
So I need you to get up off
your ass and come with me.

25:35.427 --> 25:39.197
I need you to hear me.
I'm writing new music.

25:39.198 --> 25:41.098
Can't you hear that?

25:41.099 --> 25:43.835
Are you serious?

25:43.836 --> 25:47.305
I've got to have time to
finish this new song. Please.

25:50.676 --> 25:53.010
Okay, I'm not gonna
sit here and beg you.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.046
If you want to stay here
with your wet nurse,

25:55.047 --> 25:57.715
then you suck right on, baby.

26:40.559 --> 26:42.393
Ain't you got nothing better to do

26:42.394 --> 26:43.394
than looking for me?

26:43.395 --> 26:46.064
I've got to have time to
finish this new song.

26:46.065 --> 26:47.645
Please.

26:48.867 --> 26:52.203
Yesterday, I had a dream
we were a family.

26:52.204 --> 26:55.173
It was Mom's idea to
change your sound.

26:55.174 --> 26:56.741
So she wrote you a love song.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.780
This love song.

27:05.884 --> 27:07.385
I need you to hear me.

27:07.386 --> 27:08.886
I'm writing new music.

27:08.887 --> 27:10.555
Write new music?

27:10.556 --> 27:11.522
Hello, Cookie.

27:11.523 --> 27:13.524
We had some very important work

27:13.525 --> 27:14.692
to do alone.

27:14.693 --> 27:15.994
It's new music.

27:18.364 --> 27:20.231
That's a lie.

27:20.232 --> 27:22.300
That's my song.

27:23.302 --> 27:25.803
Great.

27:30.109 --> 27:33.845
Come on, Cookie. Come on.

27:42.588 --> 27:45.790
Come on, Cookie.

27:49.180 --> 27:51.382
If you don't mind me asking,

27:51.383 --> 27:53.450
how did this happen?

27:53.451 --> 27:55.319
I mean, you know

27:55.320 --> 27:57.821
I know how it happened, you know?

27:57.822 --> 28:01.392
But, like... you know
what I'm trying to say.

28:01.393 --> 28:03.360
It's a really good question,

28:03.361 --> 28:05.629
'cause I hooked up
with J Poppa one time.

28:05.630 --> 28:07.531
All it takes is one time, Becky.

28:07.532 --> 28:09.466
More like six times.

28:10.268 --> 28:11.635
- Eight.
- Eight?!

28:11.636 --> 28:13.003
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:13.004 --> 28:14.538
J Poppa really better get on his knees

28:14.539 --> 28:16.040
and pray about something.

28:18.343 --> 28:21.178
Stupid.

28:21.179 --> 28:22.846
Damn.

28:22.847 --> 28:25.883
When this used to happen
to girls on my block,

28:25.884 --> 28:29.386
I would swear up and down
it was never gonna be me.

28:29.387 --> 28:31.422
I'm too smart for this.

28:31.423 --> 28:33.857
And I worked too hard
to get where I am.

28:33.858 --> 28:36.427
I bust my ass to get my job.

28:38.430 --> 28:43.600
I just never saw being a
mother as a job for me.

28:44.702 --> 28:47.704
So... what you gonna do?

28:53.144 --> 28:55.212
I thought

28:55.213 --> 28:57.247
you might be hungry.

28:57.248 --> 28:59.750
I hope you meant what you said

28:59.751 --> 29:02.119
about wanting to be a better man.

29:05.290 --> 29:07.691
It was nice.

29:07.692 --> 29:09.993
Maybe you could play me a song.

29:11.362 --> 29:13.730
I only play when I'm inspired,

29:13.731 --> 29:17.000
and my inspiration just
walked out the front door.

29:18.636 --> 29:23.207
I understand that you're
angry and tired, Dwight.

29:26.744 --> 29:28.812
You better just calm down.

29:28.813 --> 29:31.348
You know what?
I would walk a thousand miles

29:31.349 --> 29:34.651
through broken glass, I would
kill everybody on this planet...

29:34.652 --> 29:36.453
- I'm warning you.
- To save Cookie,

29:36.454 --> 29:39.490
because I love her.

29:39.491 --> 29:41.925
I love her. I love Cookie.

29:41.926 --> 29:44.128
You'll never know what that feels like

29:44.129 --> 29:46.430
because you're a broken bitch.

29:54.506 --> 29:57.441
Damn it. See what you made me do?

29:57.442 --> 29:59.309
Blown a circuit.

30:09.254 --> 30:11.021
Shh, shh, shh.

30:11.022 --> 30:12.515
You want to give me a heart attack?

30:12.516 --> 30:13.590
No, no, no.

30:13.591 --> 30:15.359
- Come on, I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No, I can't.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.261
The bitch chained me
to the frickin' piano.

30:17.262 --> 30:18.962
What? Okay.

30:18.963 --> 30:23.066
Shh. Let me see what I can
find and get you out of here.

30:31.309 --> 30:33.610
It looks like the Cookie crumbled.

30:33.611 --> 30:36.046
Get up.

30:37.849 --> 30:38.949
Walk.

30:49.027 --> 30:50.561
You can't get up on your own?

30:50.562 --> 30:53.230
All right, come on,
get her on her feet.

30:53.231 --> 30:54.565
Let's go.

30:54.566 --> 30:56.166
Come on.

30:56.167 --> 30:58.268
Come on. Get up, Cook.

30:58.269 --> 31:00.037
You can do this. Get up!

31:00.038 --> 31:01.738
- Stand up, Cookie.
- Get up. You can do it.

31:01.739 --> 31:04.908
- Come on. -Come on, girl.
- Come on, Cookie. Get up.

31:04.909 --> 31:06.577
- You can do it. Let's go.
- There you go.

31:06.578 --> 31:08.445
You got it. Let's go. Get up.

31:08.446 --> 31:10.414
- There you go.
- Show them, you got it.

31:10.415 --> 31:11.882
- That's it.
- Yes.

31:11.883 --> 31:13.617
There you go, Cookie.
Stand up, Cookie.

31:13.618 --> 31:15.652
- Come on, girl.
- Don't let them. There you go, Cookie!

31:15.653 --> 31:18.188
- Come on.
- You got it.

31:18.189 --> 31:20.857
There you go.

31:22.860 --> 31:24.528
That's it!

31:29.067 --> 31:30.500
Yes!

31:35.240 --> 31:37.374
Go ahead, turn the key, hack.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.210
You ain't free yet.

31:40.211 --> 31:43.013
Cookie?

31:43.014 --> 31:44.548
Hey.

31:44.549 --> 31:47.117
Are you all right?

31:50.922 --> 31:53.724
What is going on?

31:56.794 --> 31:59.196
Dwight made it

31:59.197 --> 32:01.999
perfectly clear he didn't need you.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.468
You shouldn't have come back.

32:08.649 --> 32:11.597
So, what's your plan, Claudia?
You can't keep him

32:11.598 --> 32:14.900
chained to a piano on some
Black Snake Moan kink.

32:14.901 --> 32:18.170
I'm trying to save
Dwight, not hurt him.

32:18.171 --> 32:22.774
We have a... a connection
you will never understand.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.678
I love him.

32:28.681 --> 32:31.450
Girl, do you think you the only bitch

32:31.451 --> 32:34.353
that's been caught up in
some fantasy puppy love

32:34.354 --> 32:36.455
over that old salty dog?

32:36.456 --> 32:37.823
This is not puppy love.

32:37.824 --> 32:41.059
He loves me. He told me.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.295
He ain't never told you that, heifer.

32:48.801 --> 32:51.236
Are you serious, Lucious?

32:51.237 --> 32:54.706
I'm strapped to a table because
you led this psycho on?

32:54.707 --> 32:57.342
No, it's not what you...
itit was a mistake.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.310
A mistake?

32:58.311 --> 32:59.678
Yes, 'cause I thought she was you.

32:59.679 --> 33:01.379
- What?
- What?

33:02.525 --> 33:04.092
A mistake

33:04.093 --> 33:07.128
like when you was hitting
Giuliana in Vegas,

33:07.129 --> 33:08.423
when you were on your long con?

33:08.424 --> 33:09.925
Or like you and Angelo.

33:09.926 --> 33:11.126
- Okay.
- You want to throw bones?

33:11.127 --> 33:13.228
- You want to throw sticks?
- You a trip, Lucious.

33:13.229 --> 33:15.264
You always act like you don't
have a jealous streak, but...

33:15.265 --> 33:16.765
Yeah, I'm not jealous of Angelo.

33:16.766 --> 33:19.568
It was just the fact that
Angelo was disrespecting me,

33:19.569 --> 33:21.336
and you parading him in front of me

33:21.337 --> 33:24.039
and the boy wasn't good enough
for you in the first place.

33:24.040 --> 33:27.209
Well, we don't have to worry
about Angelo anymore, do we?

33:27.210 --> 33:29.111
He got his dumb ass shot.

33:29.112 --> 33:30.112
He's dead?

33:30.113 --> 33:32.814
You need to pay attention, okay?

33:32.815 --> 33:37.986
Giuliana's probably in the dirt
somewhere, pushing up daisies.

33:37.987 --> 33:43.592
So anyone that gets involved
with you two turns up dead?

33:43.593 --> 33:45.093
Well, I mean,

33:45.094 --> 33:46.528
I wouldn't say everyone.

33:46.529 --> 33:48.363
That's ridiculous.

33:48.364 --> 33:49.604
I mean, we got a couple bodies.

33:52.035 --> 33:54.970
You think this is funny?

33:57.373 --> 34:00.876
That you ruin people's lives?

34:00.877 --> 34:04.546
What you have is not love.

34:04.547 --> 34:08.449
It's some kind of evil alchemy.

34:08.451 --> 34:11.753
Like where you amplify the worst

34:11.754 --> 34:14.389
and most vile instincts in each other.

34:16.492 --> 34:18.193
You're toxic.

34:18.194 --> 34:21.663
I'm not gonna sit here and let
you headshrink me, lady.

34:21.664 --> 34:24.065
Okay? So do what you got to do.

34:24.067 --> 34:27.034
How long were you in prison
before he served you

34:27.036 --> 34:29.404
- with divorce papers?
- I told you I wasn't doing this

34:29.405 --> 34:30.906
with you, lady.

34:30.907 --> 34:35.010
Did you ever tell him how
badly that hurt you?

34:35.011 --> 34:36.277
Why'd you abandon her?

34:36.279 --> 34:37.579
I did not abandon her.

34:37.580 --> 34:40.849
Well, you did stop calling,

34:40.850 --> 34:42.384
you stopped visiting and no letters.

34:42.385 --> 34:44.119
So, what's that?

34:44.120 --> 34:46.487
- That's abandonment.
- Did you ever think

34:46.489 --> 34:49.925
how difficult it was for me
to come there every week

34:49.926 --> 34:53.762
and see you with new scars,
new scratches, new bruises

34:53.763 --> 34:56.063
and not to be able to do nothing?

34:56.065 --> 34:59.034
I felt helpless.

34:59.035 --> 35:03.372
And when you got out, did
he greet you with open arms

35:03.373 --> 35:06.022
- or did he give you half the company?
- Yes, I did.

35:06.023 --> 35:08.014
No. What? No,
you didn't, Lucious.

35:08.015 --> 35:10.317
- I did.
- You did not.

35:10.318 --> 35:12.218
You were pitting our sons
against each other, remember?

35:12.219 --> 35:14.688
Well, because I thought
I was dying from ALS.

35:14.689 --> 35:17.324
So that stopped you from
giving me what was mine?

35:17.325 --> 35:19.960
As much as I sacrifice
for this family...

35:19.961 --> 35:23.163
No, if I got to hear one
more time you talking about

35:23.164 --> 35:26.533
you spent 17 years in prison
for this damn family,

35:26.534 --> 35:28.168
I'm telling you, Claudia,

35:28.169 --> 35:31.304
you got permission to
stab me in my neck.

35:31.305 --> 35:34.074
Have you thought how hard it
might have been for me out there

35:34.075 --> 35:36.743
trying to raise them boys by myself

35:36.744 --> 35:39.045
and try and build a freaking company?

35:39.046 --> 35:40.880
Yeah, out there. Out there, Lucious.

35:40.881 --> 35:43.049
You had help. You had my sisters.

35:43.050 --> 35:45.218
Youyou had my cousin, Bunkie,

35:45.219 --> 35:47.721
till you didn't need him anymore.

35:47.722 --> 35:51.157
Hey, Bunkie didn't deserve to die.

35:51.158 --> 35:52.492
Yeah, you need to
stop talking, Cookie.

35:52.493 --> 35:54.728
- No, I'm not gonna stop.
- You need to shut up!

35:54.729 --> 35:56.463
I'm not gonna shut up!

35:56.464 --> 35:58.131
'Cause Lucious don't shut up

35:58.132 --> 36:00.734
until he gets what he wants.

36:00.735 --> 36:04.004
You stole me from my boyfriend, Barry,

36:04.005 --> 36:06.206
and that is what put
my daddy in the grave.

36:06.207 --> 36:08.208
You know the one thing that
ain't never happened to you,

36:08.209 --> 36:11.411
Cookie, in this lifetime,
is you ain't never been took.

36:11.412 --> 36:12.679
And you saw an opportunity

36:12.680 --> 36:15.048
to get out of the
ghetto and you took it.

36:15.049 --> 36:18.351
I saw you, and I saw a
woman that could help me

36:18.352 --> 36:21.121
get to the top of this
damn game and I took it.

36:21.122 --> 36:23.590
That's what brought us together.

36:23.591 --> 36:26.092
It was the game recognizing game.

36:26.093 --> 36:28.928
It was hustle recognizing hustle.

36:28.929 --> 36:31.297
So it wasn't love.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.301
You said I was your muse.

36:36.871 --> 36:38.938
You said you loved me,

36:38.939 --> 36:42.342
so I guess that was hustle, too?

36:42.343 --> 36:44.177
Don't you get it now, Cookie?

36:44.178 --> 36:46.646
After all that pain and suffering,

36:46.647 --> 36:47.881
he didn't love you.

36:47.882 --> 36:49.182
That's not what I said.

36:49.183 --> 36:51.484
If you're really honest with yourself,

36:51.485 --> 36:52.752
you don't love him, either.

36:52.753 --> 36:55.789
You're in love with that gold logo

36:55.790 --> 36:57.891
that spins around on the record.

36:57.892 --> 37:01.394
Not the man, not Dwight.

37:08.235 --> 37:10.770
When I was in prison,
my family was the only thing

37:10.771 --> 37:12.138
that kept me going.

37:12.139 --> 37:14.407
I know we may argue over money

37:14.408 --> 37:17.444
and power and turf,

37:17.445 --> 37:18.978
but you can take all of that away

37:18.979 --> 37:23.750
and I will continue to love
them all, even Lucious.

37:24.785 --> 37:27.420
So you can kidnap him,

37:27.421 --> 37:29.889
you can chain him to a piano,

37:29.890 --> 37:31.458
you can torture him

37:31.459 --> 37:35.061
until he turns into a
little church boy,

37:35.062 --> 37:40.433
but I prefer that monster
over Dwight any day.

37:40.434 --> 37:42.435
You know why?

37:42.436 --> 37:44.137
Because he belongs to me.

37:45.506 --> 37:49.109
And if you think I'm gonna
walk out of here without him,

37:49.110 --> 37:51.744
you don't know Cookie Lyon at all.

37:53.114 --> 37:55.982
So I suggest you ask about me, bitch,

37:55.983 --> 37:57.951
'cause I don't make a move without him

37:57.952 --> 38:00.353
and he don't make one without me.

38:00.354 --> 38:01.821
Do what you got to do.

38:01.822 --> 38:05.291
- So be it.
- So be it.

38:07.128 --> 38:09.362
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

38:12.721 --> 38:14.540
No, Claudia,
you don't have to do this.

38:14.541 --> 38:17.031
I'm sorry.
This is not what I had planned.

38:17.032 --> 38:18.465
No, you don't have to do this at all.

38:18.466 --> 38:19.834
And if you had just stayed away

38:19.835 --> 38:21.869
- and let me do my work...
- Do it.

38:21.870 --> 38:23.504
- Everything would've been fine.
- No, you don't have to do it!

38:23.505 --> 38:25.606
I just need to do my work!

38:25.607 --> 38:27.508
- Do your work, bitch. Do it.
- Shut up, Cookie.

38:27.509 --> 38:28.642
- I wanted to do my work.
- Do your work.

38:28.643 --> 38:29.677
Cookie, shut the hell up!

38:29.678 --> 38:31.512
Do it.

38:36.418 --> 38:37.918
She's not supposed to be here.

38:37.919 --> 38:39.086
This is...

38:42.424 --> 38:44.825
You got to go see.

38:47.362 --> 38:50.931
Gloria, you can't be here.

38:50.932 --> 38:52.666
You need to go now.

38:56.204 --> 38:59.073
What is going on? Do you have
Lucious Lyon with you?

38:59.074 --> 39:01.764
- His family is looking for him.
- I appreciate your concern,

39:01.765 --> 39:02.910
but this is not your business.

39:02.911 --> 39:05.379
- Hey!
- Wait, no, no, no, Lucious!

39:05.380 --> 39:07.047
Lucious, Lucious, Lucious.

39:07.048 --> 39:10.251
I got a plan.

39:10.252 --> 39:12.920
- Claudia, I need to go inside.
- No.

39:12.921 --> 39:15.055
I am working.

39:15.056 --> 39:17.091
I'm going inside.

39:44.085 --> 39:46.553
Where is she?

39:46.554 --> 39:47.922
She went to get the police.

39:47.923 --> 39:50.457
Told you it wouldn't
work out the way...

40:08.109 --> 40:10.444
Cookie!

40:23.224 --> 40:24.992
You want to tussle? Come on.

40:24.993 --> 40:26.026
Let's tussle.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.636
You bbitch.

40:35.637 --> 40:37.671
Aah! Aah!

40:43.093 --> 40:44.594
You can have Lucious,

40:44.595 --> 40:46.929
- but Dwight is mine.
- No.

40:50.133 --> 40:52.568
Kill her.

40:54.071 --> 40:56.973
Go ahead, just do it.

40:56.974 --> 41:00.209
You're a killer. That's who you
are, Lucious, so just do it.

41:01.445 --> 41:02.845
Kill her!

41:02.846 --> 41:04.947
Kill that bitch.

41:04.948 --> 41:06.115
Do it!

41:10.187 --> 41:12.488
No.

41:12.489 --> 41:14.857
What?

41:27.204 --> 41:28.938
Thanks.

41:33.143 --> 41:35.411
Why didn't you kill her?

41:35.412 --> 41:37.780
And prove her right?

41:39.583 --> 41:43.786
I decide who I am, not her.

41:50.027 --> 41:52.895
Who are we, Lucious?

42:10.447 --> 42:13.549
And yet you look at me

42:13.550 --> 42:16.052
like I'm some kind of mutant.

42:16.053 --> 42:17.953
Why do you hate me?

42:19.556 --> 42:20.723
I'm the only one that knows.

42:20.724 --> 42:22.892
What he truly is.

42:22.893 --> 42:24.393
- At the push of a button.
- Boom.

42:24.394 --> 42:26.329
That's why I got to kill him.

42:26.330 --> 42:27.663
The keys to the kingdom.

42:27.664 --> 42:29.565
It's all yours, Dre.

42:29.566 --> 42:31.400
Mom! Mom!

42:31.401 --> 42:33.436
Get away from the car!

42:45.482 --> 42:48.150
Mr. Lyon.

42:48.151 --> 42:50.152
You all right?

42:51.955 --> 42:53.989
Anything you need?

42:53.990 --> 42:55.257
Yeah, I'm okay.

43:03.100 --> 43:05.768
I have to tell him.

43:05.769 --> 43:09.004
God. I have to tell him.
