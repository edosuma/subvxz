WEBVTT

01:26.359 --> 01:27.373
Four?

01:27.398 --> 01:28.304
They're crazy.

01:28.329 --> 01:29.838
I should just get up and
walk out right now.

01:29.863 --> 01:31.180
Okay, calm down.

01:31.301 --> 01:33.510
Honestly, we put a solid offer
on the table.

01:33.535 --> 01:35.613
My clients are selling for four,

01:35.638 --> 01:37.048
leaving half a million in equity.

01:37.073 --> 01:38.003
Now, this is the deal.

01:38.028 --> 01:39.170
Oh, No.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.479
Richard, please sit down.

01:52.471 --> 01:53.878
I'll show this to my clients.

01:53.903 --> 01:56.854
Don't know if it'll fly,
but we'll see.

01:59.974 --> 02:02.376
Hey, how's it going in there?
Anything I can do?

02:02.401 --> 02:03.862
Listen, when Bill and Norah leave,

02:03.887 --> 02:05.764
I want you to pop your head
into the conference room

02:05.789 --> 02:07.922
and I want you to say
these exact words:

02:07.947 --> 02:09.541
"Your clients are leaving."

02:09.566 --> 02:12.340
Sure. Anything else I need to know?

02:12.365 --> 02:14.049
No, not yet.

02:14.433 --> 02:15.636
Hmm.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.483
Well?

02:18.508 --> 02:20.102
3.5 million.

02:20.365 --> 02:22.898
We already came down from four.

02:23.153 --> 02:25.595
We'll only break even if we
agree to three and a half.

02:25.772 --> 02:27.024
Do you trust me?

02:27.313 --> 02:29.774
We know you're working as hard
as you can to close this deal,

02:29.799 --> 02:31.182
but that richard guy...

02:31.207 --> 02:33.046
is taking advantage of us.

02:33.071 --> 02:34.213
I know.

02:34.916 --> 02:36.173
That's why if you trust me,

02:36.198 --> 02:39.311
I want you to do exactly
what I'm about to tell you.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.167
In 10 minutes, I need for you to get up,

02:42.192 --> 02:45.274
walk out of this office
past the conference room,

02:45.299 --> 02:46.565
and out the door.

02:46.590 --> 02:47.389
I don't understand.

02:47.414 --> 02:49.079
We're in the middle of negotiating.

02:49.104 --> 02:50.185
Trust me.

02:50.993 --> 02:54.016
Haven't you ever done something
without knowing the outcome?

02:54.041 --> 02:55.929
Wait 10 minutes,

02:55.954 --> 02:57.156
and go home.

02:57.380 --> 03:00.404
The next time you'll hear from me
will be me calling to congratulate you.

03:00.429 --> 03:01.344
<I>Do you understand now?</I>

03:01.369 --> 03:02.408
Not really.

03:03.510 --> 03:06.411
Bill, let's just do
what she asks.

03:08.663 --> 03:10.482
'Kay. 10 minutes.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.517
Let me call you back.

03:15.542 --> 03:16.398
Well?

03:16.423 --> 03:18.281
Do we have a deal or not?

03:21.538 --> 03:23.035
What is it with you and this paper?

03:23.060 --> 03:27.627
Can't you speak? What did they say?
Do we have a deal or not?

03:29.895 --> 03:30.930
You're crazy!

03:30.955 --> 03:32.109
No, they're crazy!

03:32.134 --> 03:34.743
4.2 million?

03:35.117 --> 03:36.781
What is going on here?

03:36.806 --> 03:39.790
We made a fair offer and
they're going up in price?

03:39.815 --> 03:42.314
They're tired of this back and forth,
push and pull.

03:42.339 --> 03:46.491
And they said if you do not
agree to it within 10 minutes,

03:46.516 --> 03:48.437
the deal's off the table.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.320
I don't believe you.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.256
3.7 million is a lot of money.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.752
<i>I mean, who's gonna
walk away from that?</i>

03:57.764 --> 03:58.982
Your clients?

03:59.007 --> 04:00.431
They're leaving?

04:00.456 --> 04:02.676
They're walking out
of the building right now.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.960
Well, I guess that means
the deal's off.

04:04.985 --> 04:08.222
What? After all the time
and work I put into this?

04:08.247 --> 04:09.458
Go. Go get them.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.332
As I explained, they told me
if I didn't come back,

04:12.357 --> 04:13.357
they were walking.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.051
Meghan, your clients
are leaving.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.438
Okay, four.

04:20.091 --> 04:21.873
Four, and we go to close today.

04:21.898 --> 04:23.898
Now would you please go
get them before they leave?

04:23.916 --> 04:27.450
Ah, tell my clients I'll send the
paperwork over this afternoon.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.671
Okay.

04:34.059 --> 04:35.760
It's been a pleasure.

04:36.003 --> 04:37.147
Thank you.

04:39.082 --> 04:42.121
And congratulations on a great buy!

04:51.183 --> 04:53.300
I just closed the Smith's deal.

04:53.574 --> 04:55.301
Good. It's about time.

04:55.326 --> 04:57.130
No, I don't like any of it.
Redo it.

04:57.227 --> 04:57.942
You, come with me.

04:57.967 --> 05:00.007
There's some people I want
you to meet in my office.

05:00.974 --> 05:04.275
Meghan, I would like to introduce you
to the Yakamoto brothers,

05:04.300 --> 05:06.526
Kana and hoshi Yakamoto.

05:06.905 --> 05:10.227
Gentlemen, this is Meghan Doherty.

05:11.324 --> 05:12.867
<I>Konichiwa.</I>

05:12.892 --> 05:14.292
<I>Konichiwa.</I>

05:17.183 --> 05:19.927
She will be heading your casino project.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.627
Mr. Whitaker, we have
a lot riding on our deal.

05:23.659 --> 05:24.659
I understand.

05:24.666 --> 05:27.661
Meghan is my top investment
banker here at the firm.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.837
We've revised our business plan

05:29.862 --> 05:33.300
to include photos of the
extended land in the Mojave.

05:33.807 --> 05:36.770
I have been anticipating these
plans for a few weeks now.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.209
And for our next meeting, we'll
have an outline identifying

05:39.234 --> 05:43.633
your potential profit, risks, and
facts underlining your investment.

05:52.816 --> 05:54.199
Now, that was different.

05:54.224 --> 05:55.988
To say the least.

05:56.859 --> 05:59.084
You have your work
cut out for you now.

06:01.090 --> 06:02.909
So, we all set for tonight?

06:02.934 --> 06:04.077
The decorations are up.

06:04.102 --> 06:05.598
The caterers start serving at 8:00.

06:05.623 --> 06:07.306
Everyone knows to be
at your house by 7:00

06:07.331 --> 06:09.249
or die by the hands
of Meghan Doherty.

06:09.274 --> 06:10.585
And Valentina knows nothing?

06:10.610 --> 06:12.229
She thinks we're doing sushi.

06:12.781 --> 06:16.719
I hear you're trying to close on the
Yakamoto brothers' casino thing, Randolph.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.247
You think so, Al?

06:18.272 --> 06:19.737
Well, we'll see about that.

06:19.762 --> 06:21.805
You know, you've been trying to
squeeze our company for years now,

06:21.830 --> 06:24.110
it's not going to work.
We're not giving in.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.352
I can't wait to show off
my new outfit tonight.

06:27.581 --> 06:28.581
Like always.

06:28.777 --> 06:30.721
Are you implying
that I'm self-centered?

06:30.746 --> 06:31.946
Mmm, that's right.

06:31.971 --> 06:33.564
The same self-centered friend

06:33.589 --> 06:36.868
who stuck my neck out
to get you a job at the firm.

06:36.884 --> 06:38.665
How quickly we forget!

06:38.690 --> 06:40.476
<i>Just remember one thing,
Randolph.</i>

06:40.501 --> 06:43.153
<i>I am in first position on
Eden Graham's Mojave land,</i>

06:43.178 --> 06:45.056
<I>and I will foreclose on Saturday,

06:45.081 --> 06:49.155
<i>and when I do, well, the Yakamotos
will be knocking on my door.</i>

06:51.486 --> 06:53.419
Oh, it's the office.
Hold on. will you?

06:53.734 --> 06:54.314
Hello?

06:54.339 --> 06:56.918
Meghan, I need you here tonight.

06:56.943 --> 06:58.194
Tonight?

07:00.047 --> 07:00.905
It's Valentina's party.

07:00.930 --> 07:02.552
Sir, all right.

07:02.577 --> 07:04.714
I'll be there by 6:00 pm, sir.

07:05.663 --> 07:07.725
I'll have time to stop
by Jason's at Beverly Hills

07:07.750 --> 07:09.477
<I>before I meet with Whitaker.</I>

07:09.502 --> 07:11.910
<i>I wanna get Valentina
something special.</i>

07:14.857 --> 07:16.660
So, what's new at the firm?

07:17.383 --> 07:19.243
I closed a big one today.

07:19.268 --> 07:20.934
<I>You did? Congratulations!</I>

07:20.959 --> 07:22.105
How's your car dealership going?

07:22.130 --> 07:23.527
Dealership is great.

07:23.552 --> 07:24.485
That's gorgeous!

07:24.510 --> 07:26.369
I have to get a
gift for my friend.

07:29.204 --> 07:30.869
Oh, that's beautiful.

07:30.894 --> 07:33.058
Any interesting opportunities
you can throw my way?

07:33.083 --> 07:36.856
Yeah. One of my clients is thinking of
opening a chain of automatic car washes.

07:36.881 --> 07:38.397
Mmm, that sounds interesting.

07:38.422 --> 07:43.060
I know I did real well investing in the last
exotic car business you got me turned on to.

07:43.085 --> 07:43.868
So how much?

07:43.893 --> 07:45.539
For you, 8000.

07:46.122 --> 07:47.606
That's retail.
What's my price?

07:47.631 --> 07:50.250
Okay, I'll do 7500.

07:52.001 --> 07:54.039
Okay. 7000.
But that's it.

07:54.189 --> 07:55.189
Deal.

07:56.689 --> 07:57.618
Uh, how much for that one?

07:57.643 --> 08:00.241
That one, normally it's 2000, but...

08:00.267 --> 08:01.424
for you, 1500.

08:01.449 --> 08:02.370
Could you box that also?

08:02.395 --> 08:03.395
Sure.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.713
So how's the Ferrari?

08:05.738 --> 08:06.448
Fast.

08:06.473 --> 08:09.165
You know, that's the only car
I don't have in my dealership,

08:09.190 --> 08:11.597
so if you ever wanna get that thing
off your hands, let me know.

08:11.622 --> 08:14.717
Let go of my pride and joy?
Never.

08:14.919 --> 08:17.719
Jason, you know better
than to ask me that.

08:20.629 --> 08:22.186
<I>The Mojave Desert.</I>

08:23.483 --> 08:26.640
<I>5,000 acres of the Mojave Desert.

08:28.522 --> 08:32.595
We are going to build
a casino resort,

08:32.620 --> 08:35.721
including an 18-Hole golf course

08:35.746 --> 08:37.368
and a country club.

08:37.633 --> 08:39.136
So what's the catch?

08:39.760 --> 08:45.865
Well, Graham Ministries
owns 1,000 acres...

08:45.890 --> 08:47.723
right in the middle of it.

08:48.364 --> 08:51.395
The Yakamoto brothers
are going to need...

08:51.420 --> 08:55.887
this one piece of land
to build their vision upon.

08:56.679 --> 08:59.736
Now, this land is already
in foreclosure.

08:59.761 --> 09:03.247
But the owner,
Mr. Eden Graham,

09:03.272 --> 09:04.930
is not cooperating.

09:05.741 --> 09:08.358
And so,

09:08.383 --> 09:11.943
this land is going to
go to auction next Saturday.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.733
But that doesn't give us much time.

09:13.758 --> 09:14.557
I know.

09:14.582 --> 09:17.499
This guy absolutely refuses to sell.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.844
Therefore I need you
to drive up to the Mojave,

09:20.869 --> 09:23.562
and meet with
Mr. Eden Graham.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.910
Meghan,

09:26.484 --> 09:28.083
you close on this deal,

09:28.108 --> 09:30.440
and we'll enjoy
a celebration together.

09:31.650 --> 09:34.384
My dream will be realized...

09:34.907 --> 09:38.197
and guess who will be
in line to fill my shoes?

09:51.977 --> 09:52.942
Hi!

09:52.967 --> 09:54.347
Valentina.

09:55.732 --> 09:57.264
I'm sorry I missed your party.

09:57.289 --> 09:58.966
No, you didn't miss it.
You're here now,

09:58.991 --> 10:00.768
And this is how it should be,

10:00.793 --> 10:03.113
three best friends,
enjoying each other.

10:03.138 --> 10:06.083
I knew when Whitaker called you
to his office it would be a late night.

10:06.108 --> 10:07.803
We all knew that.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.665
We decided to wait for you.

10:13.371 --> 10:15.252
Guys, you are so sweet.

10:16.369 --> 10:18.590
Oh, I'm acting as if
it's my birthday.

10:18.615 --> 10:19.615
Here.

10:19.862 --> 10:23.006
Oh my, look at this bracelet!

10:23.031 --> 10:24.592
It's so beautiful!

10:25.448 --> 10:27.376
- Okay, open.
- Okay!

10:29.175 --> 10:30.178
Oh!

10:31.521 --> 10:32.764
Do you like it?

10:32.789 --> 10:33.955
I love it!

10:34.166 --> 10:35.790
Oh, thank you.

10:37.498 --> 10:39.160
Look what Adam got me.

10:40.571 --> 10:42.068
That is gorgeous!

10:42.093 --> 10:44.284
You must have spent your
entire paycheck on that.

10:44.309 --> 10:46.826
Not all of it, but, yeah, most.

10:51.177 --> 10:52.088
Hi, mom.

10:52.113 --> 10:53.909
I finally caught you.

10:54.281 --> 10:55.014
Let me talk to her.

10:55.039 --> 10:56.999
Mom, I'm gonna give you
a call back tomorrow.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.319
Wait, you were supposed to
call me back yesterday.

11:01.195 --> 11:03.817
Good night. I love you.

11:05.908 --> 11:07.979
She has the worst timing.

11:09.242 --> 11:12.483
I have the biggest deal of my life
and she calls to chit chat?

11:12.712 --> 11:14.373
Don't be selfish.

11:14.398 --> 11:16.068
It's your mother.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.071
<i>You can't take two minutes
of your time?</i>

11:19.782 --> 11:22.266
Two minutes will
turn into two hours.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.167
I just have so much on my mind
with the Yakamoto account.

11:25.192 --> 11:27.668
Meghan, ever since
I've known you,

11:27.693 --> 11:30.257
all you care about is money
and your career.

11:30.282 --> 11:32.530
What's going to happen
when you turn 60?

11:33.106 --> 11:35.756
You're going to wish that someone
would call and visit you.

11:35.781 --> 11:39.763
And guess what? You are
going to be all alone.

11:39.788 --> 11:41.598
You are just as old as I am.

11:41.623 --> 11:43.726
But I love my family.

11:43.751 --> 11:47.396
And one day I plan to settle down
and have children of my own,

11:47.421 --> 11:50.914
so that when I get old
I'll have someone to love me.

11:50.939 --> 11:52.069
Look at you!

11:52.094 --> 11:54.806
You don't date and you have no
friends outside of Adam and me.

11:54.831 --> 11:55.796
It's late,

11:55.821 --> 11:59.244
and I have to prepare for the biggest
presentation of my life tomorrow.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.010
That's right.
Big presentation.

12:02.743 --> 12:05.294
I'll go get my computer
so I can assist.

12:15.355 --> 12:17.324
You know that I'm right.

12:23.471 --> 12:27.774
Let me google "God's Country"
and see what we're working with.

12:28.127 --> 12:29.503
What do we have here?

12:29.528 --> 12:31.606
God's Country is not
just a getaway.

12:31.631 --> 12:34.202
It's a safe haven for
those who need a break.

12:34.227 --> 12:36.851
In the middle of 1000 acres,

12:36.876 --> 12:39.918
we offer the best hiking, camping

12:39.943 --> 12:43.906
run by minister Eden Graham,
second generation...

12:48.718 --> 12:50.264
Good night.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.218
Stupid shoe!

13:37.860 --> 13:38.800
Have they made it?

13:38.825 --> 13:40.127
Meghan, where are you?

13:40.152 --> 13:41.357
<I>Have they made it?</I>

13:41.382 --> 13:42.695
They are here now.

13:42.720 --> 13:43.369
Okay.

13:43.394 --> 13:46.544
And Mr. Whitaker is walking them
into the conference room.

13:46.569 --> 13:48.274
Why didn't you wake me?

13:48.299 --> 13:50.100
I've been calling you all morning.

13:50.125 --> 13:52.535
<i>I had Research put something
together. It's on your desk.</i>

13:52.560 --> 13:57.019
Okay. Offer them some coffee, tea,
something to drink. Stall them.

13:58.165 --> 14:00.664
You want me to go
into the conference room?

14:00.689 --> 14:01.153
But I...

14:01.178 --> 14:03.788
I don't have time for these questions!

14:03.813 --> 14:05.504
Just do it!

14:06.614 --> 14:07.614
Okay.

14:09.847 --> 14:12.815
Who do you like better?
You like Matsui or Ichiro?

14:12.840 --> 14:15.008
Meghan is a couple
of minutes away.

14:15.033 --> 14:18.423
She asked me to offer you
something to drink.

14:19.178 --> 14:21.352
Coffee? Water? Tea?

14:21.377 --> 14:25.559
Tell Ms. Daugherty we prefer
her presence instead of drinks.

14:26.206 --> 14:30.600
But since you're here,
bring all of the above.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.582
Yes, sir.

14:35.809 --> 14:38.543
Anyway, my favorite player
is Hideki Matsui.

14:50.788 --> 14:53.529
They're waiting for you.
I stalled as long as I could.

14:53.570 --> 14:55.075
Here's your material.

14:55.913 --> 14:57.073
Oh, uh.

15:02.914 --> 15:04.117
Gentlemen.

15:05.778 --> 15:07.084
Thank you for coming.

15:07.817 --> 15:09.609
Shall we get down to business?

15:13.260 --> 15:17.781
We've identified your prospectus and have
done an evaluation over the next 10 years,

15:17.814 --> 15:19.570
keeping in mind the growth rate

15:19.595 --> 15:22.251
of the surrounding Mojave area.

15:22.276 --> 15:26.149
Now, we see your casino not only
as gambling for adults,

15:26.174 --> 15:28.961
and we believe you have
an entertainment portal.

15:29.407 --> 15:34.450
We see the profit potential
at a capture of 40% lift annually.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.553
Your investment over
the course of 10 years

15:36.578 --> 15:40.022
will yield an annual $2 million,

15:40.047 --> 15:43.871
which by year eight, from
your profit, your interest,

15:43.896 --> 15:47.430
and neighboring leases, your
investment will be paid back in full.

15:47.455 --> 15:51.601
We at Whitaker & Associates would love
to team up with the Yakamoto Brothers

15:51.626 --> 15:56.556
to turn the Mojave Desert into one
of America's most impressive casinos.

15:56.581 --> 16:01.381
Whitaker & Associates is the most
qualified financial organization

16:01.406 --> 16:04.265
to bring your astonishing
vision to reality.

16:05.149 --> 16:06.185
Thank you.

16:08.917 --> 16:09.917
Excellent.

16:10.205 --> 16:11.255
Very good job.

16:13.665 --> 16:14.698
<I>Arigato.</I>

16:15.352 --> 16:17.842
I'm sorry. Could someone
translate for me?

16:18.069 --> 16:21.690
I just complimented Ms. Doherty
on her presentation.

16:23.660 --> 16:24.660
Excellent.

16:31.807 --> 16:34.147
Did you see the look
on their faces?

16:34.172 --> 16:35.196
I did.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.407
We really won them over.

16:38.168 --> 16:40.265
You know, Meghan, I don't
hand out compliments too easily,

16:40.290 --> 16:42.682
but you were outstanding
today and I mean that.

16:42.707 --> 16:46.147
But before we start
blowing our own horn here,

16:46.172 --> 16:47.655
we still have some
unfinished business.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.702
Come on, walk with me to my car.

16:50.747 --> 16:52.745
All right, let's not
waste any time with this.

16:52.770 --> 16:54.935
I want you to get up there
as early as tomorrow.

16:54.960 --> 16:58.735
Have you assistant call ahead
and set up a meeting with Graham.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.694
And Meghan,

17:01.304 --> 17:03.208
do not pull any punches
with this guy.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.978
Let him know
that you mean business,

17:05.002 --> 17:06.840
that nothing,
and I mean nothing,

17:06.866 --> 17:09.761
will stop Whitaker & Associates
from closing that deal.

17:09.786 --> 17:12.247
'Cause you know what?
I can feel it, God is on our side.

17:12.271 --> 17:13.752
So you close this.

17:28.686 --> 17:29.285
Hello?

17:29.310 --> 17:33.055
I thought maybe I'd have a chance
to speak with my only child.

17:33.080 --> 17:36.179
But she's always too busy
for her only mother.

17:36.757 --> 17:38.453
Sorry, mother.
I've been swamped at work.

17:38.478 --> 17:40.663
Well, it must be going well.

17:40.688 --> 17:42.345
I received another
check in the mail.

17:42.370 --> 17:43.290
What are you doing?

17:43.315 --> 17:47.897
Oh, every week the church hands out
food donations to senior citizens.

17:47.922 --> 17:51.675
So I'm headed on over
to the retirement home,

17:51.700 --> 17:54.115
which is where I'll be
living in a couple of years.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.074
Mom, come on. You
make me feel so guilty.

17:56.099 --> 17:57.188
Well, you should.

17:57.213 --> 18:00.531
What has it been, almost six
months since I've seen you?

18:01.129 --> 18:02.943
You know what this coming
weekend is.

18:02.968 --> 18:05.838
No, ma, I don't know what
this coming weekend is.

18:07.931 --> 18:10.397
It's my birthday, Meghan.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.380
Listen,

18:15.405 --> 18:18.417
Pasadena is not that far from Los Angeles,

18:18.441 --> 18:20.303
so I don't wanna hear any excuses,

18:20.328 --> 18:22.810
and I don't want another check from you.

18:23.043 --> 18:26.342
I wanna be with my daughter on my birthday.

18:26.367 --> 18:29.892
Okay, ma, I will be with
you on your birthday.

18:30.003 --> 18:31.396
I promise.

18:35.844 --> 18:37.376
Cross your heart?

18:37.921 --> 18:39.873
Cross my heart.

18:40.228 --> 18:44.254
Ha! Oh, I'm so excited
I'm gonna see you finally!

18:44.911 --> 18:45.937
I love you.

18:46.406 --> 18:47.834
Love you too, mom.

18:52.998 --> 18:54.176
All right.

19:23.033 --> 19:23.911
Hello, Adam.

19:23.936 --> 19:25.978
Meghan, hey.

19:26.003 --> 19:29.507
Um, Mr. Whitaker asked me
to get you on the phone.

19:30.363 --> 19:31.385
Oh, no.

19:31.660 --> 19:32.936
- Here he comes.
- Get Meghan on the phone yet?

19:32.959 --> 19:34.239
Wait, what does he wanna talk about?

19:34.264 --> 19:36.297
- Yes, sir.
- Adam, wait...

19:36.322 --> 19:37.975
Hello, Meghan. You're
heading up there, I hope.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.172
Yes, sir. I should be there
in a couple of hours.

19:40.197 --> 19:41.484
Good. Now listen to me.

19:41.509 --> 19:44.007
The Yakamoto brothers are
scheduled to fly back into town

19:44.032 --> 19:46.236
this Thursday
to finalize everything.

19:46.261 --> 19:49.198
I'm counting on you. I am depending
on you to take care of this.

19:49.223 --> 19:51.629
- Yes, sir, I plan to.
- Don't plan. Do it.

19:51.654 --> 19:53.906
Call me the second you have
your meeting with Graham.

19:53.931 --> 19:58.509
Do not leave his side without
signing those documents.

20:00.619 --> 20:01.775
Bye.

20:19.101 --> 20:20.101
"Close it."

20:20.743 --> 20:22.102
I'll close it.
I'll show him.

20:22.127 --> 20:25.127
I'll make partner
and force him to retire.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.520
Where am I?

20:48.558 --> 20:50.063
Hey, sir.

20:50.479 --> 20:51.753
Finally.

20:51.778 --> 20:53.976
Do you know where God's Country is?

20:56.950 --> 20:59.009
You need to go about 10
miles down the road,

20:59.034 --> 21:00.687
and make a right at the fork in the road.

21:00.712 --> 21:03.889
Make sure that you make
the next right, not left.

21:03.914 --> 21:05.732
When you turn down that road,

21:05.757 --> 21:07.222
go straight, you'll run right into it.

21:07.247 --> 21:08.656
Got it. Two rights, got it.

21:08.681 --> 21:10.416
Miss, my truck over here...

21:15.840 --> 21:16.840
Okay.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.247
Whoo!

21:51.587 --> 21:54.678
Paris hilton ain't got nothin'
on you, girl!

21:54.797 --> 21:56.092
Da-Da-Da-Da!

21:56.587 --> 21:57.664
I'm sorry, ma'am.

21:57.689 --> 21:59.411
Don't touch the car!

21:59.436 --> 22:02.891
Ma'am, it's not every day
that a Ferrari pulls up.

22:02.916 --> 22:04.332
Hoo!

22:06.436 --> 22:08.686
Hey, my name is lenny.
I'm one of the counselors here.

22:10.060 --> 22:10.954
Okay.

22:10.979 --> 22:12.168
I'm sorry. I didn't
get your name.

22:12.193 --> 22:13.413
I didn't give my name to you?

22:13.438 --> 22:15.676
Listen, I'm looking for Mr. Graham.

22:15.701 --> 22:16.766
Is he around?

22:17.031 --> 22:18.995
Mr. Graham is always around.

22:19.267 --> 22:21.085
Well then, can you
get him for me?

22:21.280 --> 22:22.859
I'll be right back.

22:29.581 --> 22:30.942
Hey, uh, Mr. Graham,

22:30.967 --> 22:33.735
there's a woman out here
with a Ferrari.

22:34.185 --> 22:35.817
Really? Where's she from?

22:36.033 --> 22:37.599
My name is Doherty.

22:37.902 --> 22:39.101
Where, Where's she from?

22:40.057 --> 22:43.676
Mrs. Doubtfire, he wants
to know where you're from.

22:43.984 --> 22:45.178
Doherty.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.740
My name is Doherty.

22:48.068 --> 22:48.597
Huh?

22:48.622 --> 22:50.497
I'm from Whitaker & Associates.

22:50.622 --> 22:51.381
Huh?

22:51.555 --> 22:52.871
Whitak... Oh, just...

22:52.896 --> 22:55.984
I'm sorry, ma'am. I just don't
understand what you're saying.

22:56.009 --> 22:57.879
Mr. Graham,
this is Meghan Doherty.

22:57.904 --> 22:59.281
I'm with Whitaker & Associates.

22:59.306 --> 23:00.976
My assistant called yesterday.

23:01.765 --> 23:04.766
- Hello, Mr. Graham?
- Ma'am. Ma'am.

23:04.791 --> 23:05.791
What?

23:06.759 --> 23:09.088
If you wanna talk to Mr. Graham,

23:09.113 --> 23:11.451
you have to push
that button right there.

23:12.243 --> 23:13.731
Where's his office?

23:14.836 --> 23:16.800
Where is his office?

23:20.582 --> 23:21.542
Incompetent people.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.700
<I>Ooh, that's a nice ride!</I>

23:30.538 --> 23:31.999
Hoo!

23:49.002 --> 23:50.539
One fancy automobile!

23:55.647 --> 23:56.647
Mr. Graham.

23:56.662 --> 23:58.258
- No, give me a hug.
- What?

23:58.283 --> 23:59.309
Here we go.

24:00.854 --> 24:02.153
Ms. Doherty?

24:02.773 --> 24:04.012
Doherty. Meghan Doherty.

24:04.037 --> 24:06.083
Good to meet you.
This is pastor Tinsley.

24:06.108 --> 24:07.394
How do you do?

24:07.707 --> 24:09.460
Pastor Tinsley, what do you think?

24:09.485 --> 24:10.791
Breathtaking.

24:10.816 --> 24:14.409
Pastor Tinsley's church is gonna be
our guest all this week at camp.

24:14.803 --> 24:17.837
Mr. Graham, is there someplace
we can speak in private?

24:19.069 --> 24:20.117
Well, sure.

24:21.011 --> 24:22.087
Right this way.

24:37.131 --> 24:38.210
Have a seat.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.719
I need to get right to the point.

24:42.441 --> 24:46.402
As you know, we're the lender
in second position on your property.

24:46.427 --> 24:50.732
Mr. Whitaker sent me down here to
discuss your property in its current state.

24:53.553 --> 24:57.721
You're in foreclosure, set to
go to auction this Saturday.

24:58.591 --> 25:02.878
Since we don't wanna risk anyone
else attempting to buy your property,

25:02.903 --> 25:05.849
I'm here to make you an offer
and close on this deal today.

25:05.874 --> 25:07.828
Hmm. It's funny.

25:08.213 --> 25:10.028
I spoke to one of you
people the other day.

25:10.053 --> 25:13.177
Now Whitaker's sending somebody
down here to patronize me?

25:14.020 --> 25:16.473
Mr. Graham, I am not patronizing you.

25:16.718 --> 25:19.628
I'm here to make you
a serious cash offer,

25:19.653 --> 25:22.202
an offer that I know is more than fair.

25:23.556 --> 25:25.099
Look,

25:25.124 --> 25:27.170
you're behind in monthly payments,

25:27.195 --> 25:28.933
behind on your taxes.

25:28.958 --> 25:30.837
We're just trynna help.

25:31.038 --> 25:33.199
All you have to do...

25:33.224 --> 25:36.001
is sign the power of ownership over to us

25:36.636 --> 25:38.580
and we can handle the rest.

25:38.605 --> 25:39.789
Ms. Doherty,

25:39.980 --> 25:41.949
I may be a little late
paying this mortgage,

25:41.974 --> 25:43.250
but...

25:43.275 --> 25:45.053
I serve an on-time God,

25:45.078 --> 25:48.660
and he will deliver us from this
financial hold your bank has on us.

25:48.685 --> 25:49.934
Mr. Graham...

25:49.959 --> 25:52.393
Do you know anything about this place?

25:52.418 --> 25:54.451
Or are you just down
here to earn a commission?

25:54.476 --> 25:56.488
I'm here to do you a favor.

25:59.890 --> 26:00.890
Follow me.

26:09.561 --> 26:11.390
Like to take you on
a little tour of the camp.

26:11.415 --> 26:15.161
A tour is not going to change
the position you're in.

26:15.186 --> 26:17.568
Come on. What do you have to lose?

26:40.250 --> 26:41.250
Hmmm.

26:41.718 --> 26:44.724
<i>I'm second-generation
land owner of Graham Holdings.</i>

26:44.749 --> 26:46.280
<I>My dad was a minister.</I>

26:46.465 --> 26:47.896
I use this land to give back to God

26:47.921 --> 26:52.138
for me rebelling against his
righteous ways when I was a kid.

26:56.438 --> 26:57.638
Look at it.

26:59.055 --> 27:00.464
<I>I love this land.</I>

27:02.877 --> 27:04.629
There's no place like it.

27:06.744 --> 27:08.947
Our ministry's taken a big hit,

27:08.972 --> 27:11.041
just as I'm sure residential has.

27:11.481 --> 27:13.579
Churches can't tithe the way they used to

27:13.604 --> 27:14.781
or pay extras for the kids,

27:14.806 --> 27:17.177
that trickles down
to people like us.

27:19.891 --> 27:22.247
Meghan you can tell Whitaker

27:22.272 --> 27:24.094
I have to decline his offer.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.681
Listen, the deal is the deal.

27:29.731 --> 27:33.083
You can pray to your God
any time, day or night,

27:33.108 --> 27:36.854
but it's not gonna stop the fact that
out bank is gonna take this property.

27:37.401 --> 27:39.075
<I>Take me back to my car.</I>

27:51.772 --> 27:53.597
Meghan,

27:53.622 --> 27:54.797
I'll tell you what.

27:56.110 --> 27:59.775
I'd be willing to put my faith
that God will come through

27:59.800 --> 28:01.213
this will all be water under the bridge.

28:01.238 --> 28:03.617
If you just...

28:03.642 --> 28:06.755
stay here for six days.

28:07.204 --> 28:08.671
See what it is we do here.

28:08.696 --> 28:11.250
Watch God's blessings unfold.

28:12.043 --> 28:18.010
And then if by some chance you don't
see why this land is so important,

28:18.035 --> 28:20.094
I'll sign your deal before
the land goes to auction

28:20.119 --> 28:22.538
so you can get your
big commission check.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.322
Listen,

28:24.347 --> 28:25.976
take the check,

28:26.001 --> 28:28.278
gather your Christian folk,

28:28.303 --> 28:31.280
and go build a church in a new location,

28:32.210 --> 28:34.376
near a city where people actually live.

28:36.569 --> 28:37.761
Ms. Doherty,

28:38.219 --> 28:42.128
I know that as long as I don't put
my signature on that document,

28:42.153 --> 28:45.636
I have a fighting chance to
keep what's rightfully mine.

28:45.661 --> 28:47.224
No,

28:47.249 --> 28:49.238
it's not over till God says it's over.

28:49.263 --> 28:51.868
And God hasn't told me anything.

28:55.208 --> 28:56.260
So,

28:56.285 --> 28:59.244
why would me staying here for six days

28:59.269 --> 29:02.831
make any difference in whether
or not you sign this deal?

29:02.856 --> 29:04.730
You'll be able to see what we do here

29:04.755 --> 29:06.318
with your own eyes.

29:06.343 --> 29:10.260
Maybe then you'll understand why
I'm willing to put my faith in God

29:10.285 --> 29:13.612
and fight to keep this place
open to help people in need.

29:13.715 --> 29:17.389
To you, this is just another business deal.

29:17.991 --> 29:19.642
This is my whole life.

29:19.667 --> 29:21.630
If it's more money you want,
let me call Mr. Whitaker.

29:21.655 --> 29:23.508
Let's up the offer.

29:23.533 --> 29:24.731
You have my offer.

29:24.756 --> 29:25.756
Six days and I'll sign.

29:25.766 --> 29:28.064
That's my promise
to you and to God.

29:29.921 --> 29:31.143
One condition:

29:31.168 --> 29:32.628
the deal remains between you and me.

29:32.653 --> 29:34.046
You can't tell anybody else.

29:34.071 --> 29:35.904
I don't want people around
here to judge or treat you

29:35.929 --> 29:38.666
any differently than
the rest of the guests. Ok?

29:45.071 --> 29:46.331
All right.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.662
Deal.

29:51.338 --> 29:52.338
Okay.

29:52.951 --> 29:54.763
I just need to make a few calls.

30:15.855 --> 30:16.955
Meghan.

30:19.267 --> 30:21.805
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

30:21.830 --> 30:22.485
Sorry.

30:22.510 --> 30:24.571
Uh, we have a camp meeting
in five minutes.

30:24.596 --> 30:26.574
About this deal,

30:26.599 --> 30:29.009
I need to go and make a call to my office.

30:29.034 --> 30:31.247
I need to go home and
get some extra clothing,

30:31.272 --> 30:35.141
because the only clothing
I have is what I'm wearing.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.216
<i>Now, do you have a phone
in your office I can use?</i>

30:37.241 --> 30:38.110
Five minutes.

30:38.135 --> 30:39.291
And you can leave all
your stuff in the car.

30:39.316 --> 30:41.013
No one's gonna mess with it.

30:41.038 --> 30:42.301
Five minutes.

30:52.853 --> 30:56.532
Hasn't anyone ever told them
that staring isn't polite?

30:59.555 --> 31:01.690
Meghan,

31:01.715 --> 31:03.378
listen, why don't you join
my church's ocngregation?

31:03.403 --> 31:05.057
You can be our special guest.

31:05.082 --> 31:08.882
Maybe you could teach my kids a little something
about whatever it is that you do. They...

31:08.907 --> 31:10.325
They love your car.

31:10.350 --> 31:11.923
Sure. Whatever you say.

31:11.948 --> 31:13.284
Awesome. Thank you.

31:14.363 --> 31:17.989
Well, I guess somebody didn't get the
camp memo about appropriate attire.

31:18.875 --> 31:19.684
I'm Jacob.

31:19.709 --> 31:21.519
Everyone around here calls me Jake.

31:21.544 --> 31:25.162
Well, Jacob, you can keep your
smart comments to yourself.

31:25.692 --> 31:27.187
Ok, I just saw you walk
in here with my father,

31:27.212 --> 31:29.307
and I can tell by the
way that you're dressed

31:29.332 --> 31:31.810
that you're obviously not one
of the church group leaders.

31:31.835 --> 31:33.394
So,

31:33.419 --> 31:34.174
why are you here?

31:34.199 --> 31:36.609
I'm here for the same
reason as everyone else.

31:36.634 --> 31:37.992
Enlightenment.

31:38.017 --> 31:40.097
Now I don't know who you are,
but...

31:41.167 --> 31:43.326
I'm sorry, did you just say
that was your father?

31:43.351 --> 31:45.696
Yeah. I run this place
with my parents.

31:45.721 --> 31:47.484
I'm the head counselor here.

31:48.014 --> 31:49.895
Sorry. Meghan Doherty.

31:50.339 --> 31:51.861
Hello, everyone.

31:52.968 --> 31:54.779
Welcome to God's Country.

31:55.003 --> 31:58.641
I want you to shake away all the
worries of your day-to-day rat race

31:58.666 --> 31:59.970
and peer pressure,

31:59.995 --> 32:01.425
and especially video games,

32:01.450 --> 32:04.106
social networking, and...

32:04.131 --> 32:05.138
texting.

32:07.138 --> 32:09.490
You're here to relax,
make friends,

32:09.515 --> 32:14.851
and most of all, discover that real
inner love of self and God's spirit.

32:14.876 --> 32:18.958
Before we begin, I want you to turn
to the person to your right and left,

32:18.983 --> 32:21.243
and give them a big, welcoming hug.

32:22.795 --> 32:23.579
Oh!

32:23.604 --> 32:24.604
Hey.

32:29.057 --> 32:30.057
Okay.

32:30.602 --> 32:31.613
Oh, my...

32:34.057 --> 32:35.244
Meghan,

32:35.269 --> 32:38.330
I'd like to introduce my
better half over here

32:38.355 --> 32:41.431
for almost 25 years now, Caroline.

32:43.170 --> 32:46.457
She's sort of the mother hen,
caretaker of the camp.

32:46.482 --> 32:50.083
So if you get sick, bitten,
or just plain homesick, she's...

32:50.108 --> 32:51.535
- Bitten?
- Honey, stop it.

32:51.560 --> 32:52.746
He's just pulling your leg.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.758
If it was the summer time, yes.

32:54.783 --> 32:57.864
But in the cooler months
we don't have that problem.

32:57.889 --> 32:58.935
Good to know.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.924
Oh, hey, Meghan, this is Geri.

33:00.949 --> 33:02.656
She's one of the counselors
here. You guys should...

33:02.681 --> 33:03.736
Hi!

33:04.491 --> 33:06.368
Are you a model?
You're so pretty.

33:06.393 --> 33:09.155
I know your feet must be
killing you in those high heels.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.980
Uh, Geri, go fetch Meghan
a pair of your boots.

33:11.005 --> 33:11.475
Oh, no.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.208
They'll probably be a little too big,

33:13.233 --> 33:17.224
But they'll give your feet
a much needed rest.

33:17.249 --> 33:18.515
Just show me to my room,

33:18.540 --> 33:21.506
so I can get on my laptop
and make a few calls,

33:21.531 --> 33:22.935
and I'll be awesome.

33:22.960 --> 33:27.450
Meghan, you're kinda missing the point
of what we do here in God's Country.

33:27.475 --> 33:28.708
And that is?

33:29.079 --> 33:30.283
Off the grid.

33:30.614 --> 33:31.618
Here you go.

33:32.689 --> 33:34.281
Anyway, welcome aboard.

33:34.306 --> 33:36.607
Grudge match. Ping pong.
Let's go. You wanna watch?

33:36.632 --> 33:37.632
I'm gonna watch.

33:38.148 --> 33:39.063
Ok.

33:39.088 --> 33:39.853
Those are for you.

33:39.878 --> 33:41.244
I'll take you to your trailer.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.745
You're gonna want those.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.179
I'm not wearing them.

33:44.614 --> 33:46.043
My trailer?

33:59.396 --> 34:00.579
What is this?

34:00.977 --> 34:02.398
<I>Well, this is your living quarters.</I>

34:02.423 --> 34:04.089
<I>Sorry it's not the plaza hotel.</I>

34:05.672 --> 34:07.958
I am not staying in that.

34:08.606 --> 34:12.284
Well, it's stay in that trailer, or
in the house full of teenagers.

34:14.976 --> 34:16.181
Here or there.

34:39.355 --> 34:41.522
What have I gotten myself into?

34:56.396 --> 34:57.396
Gross!

35:02.598 --> 35:03.669
Get it off!

35:20.049 --> 35:21.773
What are you doing, stalking me?

35:21.798 --> 35:23.901
No, I just came by
to see if you were okay.

35:23.926 --> 35:25.192
I am not okay!

35:26.075 --> 35:28.005
I hear these things howling at me

35:28.030 --> 35:29.587
and there was this big bug...

35:29.612 --> 35:30.997
Wait. A bug?

35:31.298 --> 35:32.351
Yes!

35:32.573 --> 35:34.514
Are you laughing at me?

35:36.683 --> 35:37.574
Wait a minute.

35:37.599 --> 35:38.998
What are you doing?

35:39.725 --> 35:40.759
Hey, mom?

35:42.036 --> 35:43.036
<I>Yeah, honey.</I>

35:43.234 --> 35:45.437
Can you send Geri to
trailer number one, please?

35:46.118 --> 35:47.340
<I>What's up, Jake?</I>

35:48.156 --> 35:49.634
It's Meghan.

35:50.363 --> 35:51.611
And a bug.

35:52.593 --> 35:53.889
It was a big bug. Big.

35:53.914 --> 35:57.942
Sorry. A big bug attacked her, and
now she refuses to go to the trailer.

35:57.967 --> 36:00.021
<i>You want me to send someone
to stay with her?</i>

36:00.046 --> 36:00.884
Affirmative.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.125
<i>Okay, honey. I'll tell Geri. Bye bye.</i>

36:05.860 --> 36:06.860
Thanks.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.483
It was a big, big bug.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.068
Yeah. It's all clear.

36:18.074 --> 36:19.379
Hi again.

36:20.649 --> 36:22.038
Are you always so petulant?

36:22.063 --> 36:23.494
Oh, um...

36:23.519 --> 36:25.609
They actually said that you
needed a little help out here,

36:25.634 --> 36:27.610
so we're gonna be roommates now.

36:27.635 --> 36:28.867
I hope that's okay.

36:28.892 --> 36:31.106
You're not too adjusted
to the wild, huh?

36:31.138 --> 36:33.770
- That's okay.
- Well, now you've a bodyguard.

36:33.795 --> 36:35.026
Thank you.

36:35.493 --> 36:36.580
Okay.

36:38.118 --> 36:39.154
Okay.

36:39.828 --> 36:40.983
This is for you.

36:41.008 --> 36:42.041
What is this?

36:42.065 --> 36:44.440
Um, Mr. Graham said that you
needed some clothes to wear,

36:44.465 --> 36:46.056
so I just brought you some of my own.

36:46.060 --> 36:47.249
I'm not wearing that.

36:52.379 --> 36:55.003
We don't get any signals out here.

36:55.028 --> 36:57.154
What, are you guys in the 1800's?

36:57.179 --> 36:58.638
How do you live like this?

36:58.663 --> 36:59.698
Live like what?

36:59.730 --> 37:00.407
Like this.

37:00.432 --> 37:02.319
No cell phone, Wi-Fi.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.842
What are you supposed to be proving?

37:05.686 --> 37:09.226
Not trynna prove anything. We're
actually just in the middle of nowhere.

37:12.743 --> 37:13.643
Hey, Meghan.

37:13.671 --> 37:14.095
What?

37:14.120 --> 37:17.828
Do you mind if we just say a quick
prayer before we head in for the night?

37:17.853 --> 37:18.523
Pray on.

37:18.548 --> 37:19.548
Okay.

37:24.894 --> 37:27.428
<i>You've reached Meghan Doherty.
Please leave a message.</i>

37:28.441 --> 37:31.066
Meghan, bet you've wrapped
Graham and those documents

37:31.091 --> 37:32.412
around your little finger today.

37:32.437 --> 37:34.492
I can't wait to hear about it.
Call me.

37:42.168 --> 37:43.653
<I>Meghan, wake up!</I>

37:44.292 --> 37:46.779
Meghan. Meghan. Meghan.

37:47.093 --> 37:48.474
Wake up, sleepyhead!

37:52.935 --> 37:54.281
What time is it?

37:54.306 --> 37:55.416
It's 6:00.

37:55.441 --> 37:56.833
6:00 a.m.?

37:56.858 --> 37:57.858
Yeah.

37:58.502 --> 38:01.043
Come back at 10:00 a.m.
I don't do breakfast.

38:12.167 --> 38:13.275
Geri,

38:13.300 --> 38:14.616
where's Meghan?

38:14.641 --> 38:16.166
She wouldn't get up.

38:21.172 --> 38:24.498
Jake, will you ask pastor Tinsley to
start this morning's prayer service?

38:24.524 --> 38:25.283
Yeah, you got it.

38:25.308 --> 38:26.595
Thanks. Be right back.

38:28.553 --> 38:31.577
All right, y'all, how's
everybody doing today?

38:47.281 --> 38:48.738
What is wrong with you?

38:48.763 --> 38:50.041
We're having prayer before breakfast

38:50.066 --> 38:52.262
and you have to join your assigned group.

38:52.287 --> 38:53.617
Listen. I'm tired.

38:53.642 --> 38:55.013
I am not going anywhere.

38:55.038 --> 38:57.714
And I've agreed to stay here for six days.

38:59.227 --> 39:01.945
You agreed to be part of the journey.

39:02.362 --> 39:04.758
Being part of the journey
means taking the journey.

39:04.933 --> 39:07.984
Now you don't show up for your
assigned group, our agreement's off.

39:08.009 --> 39:11.257
You can get back in your fancy car
drive back to Los Angeles today.

39:12.847 --> 39:14.938
Okay. I get your point.

39:16.215 --> 39:17.455
Let me just go take a shower...

39:17.460 --> 39:18.256
No time for that.

39:18.281 --> 39:20.783
You gotta meet your group.
Breakfast is in 15 minutes.

39:22.988 --> 39:25.670
Get up, throw some water on
your face, I'll see you out here.

39:40.056 --> 39:41.976
Jake, do we know
where your father is?

39:45.590 --> 39:46.668
There she is.

40:22.927 --> 40:25.515
Meghan, I think we can
all sit down together,

40:25.540 --> 40:27.519
and eat as a family.

40:28.324 --> 40:29.324
Hmm?

40:33.344 --> 40:35.172
Let's bow our heads in prayer.

40:36.700 --> 40:40.039
And Jesus said unto them,
"I am the bread of life,

40:40.064 --> 40:43.192
He that cometh to me
shall never hunger

40:43.217 --> 40:46.353
And he that believeth
on me shall never thirst.

40:46.378 --> 40:47.775
Amen.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.348
Now we can eat.

40:56.464 --> 40:59.213
All right, gang, remember
this is a contest,

40:59.238 --> 41:00.447
so there are special reward activities

41:00.472 --> 41:03.493
for the group that pulls
together and does the best job.

41:03.518 --> 41:06.670
The first activity is a two-Mile
hike up to the tennis courts.

41:06.695 --> 41:08.425
So, Lenny, it's all you, buddy.

41:09.236 --> 41:10.236
Wait.

41:10.246 --> 41:10.988
You all right?

41:11.013 --> 41:14.718
I am not dressed for a two-Mile
hike out in this jungle.

41:14.743 --> 41:17.313
I'd actually be more
worried about the snakes.

41:19.337 --> 41:21.046
Come on, I'm just kidding with you.

41:21.193 --> 41:22.389
I got your back.

41:26.301 --> 41:27.852
You're gonna be all right.

41:28.066 --> 41:29.066
Thank you.

41:29.169 --> 41:31.209
Okay, let's go for a hike!

41:42.106 --> 41:44.337
<i>You've reached Meghan Doherty.
Please leave a message.</i>

41:44.921 --> 41:47.321
<I>Hola, Meghan, you've been
gone for two days now.

41:47.346 --> 41:50.210
We all know when you're working on
a big deal you stop communicating,

41:50.235 --> 41:54.828
but you missed our weekly facial
appointment today, and that's not like you.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.763
Okay, call me. Bye.

42:02.227 --> 42:05.867
Group three, we're here,
and you might notice

42:05.892 --> 42:07.590
that there are no tennis rackets.

42:07.615 --> 42:08.660
But...

42:08.685 --> 42:12.352
We do have these.

42:12.961 --> 42:14.965
Oh, no.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.866
It is bad enough
that we hiked two miles,

42:18.891 --> 42:21.131
And now you expect us to work?

42:21.156 --> 42:23.089
Come on. It'll be fun.
You'll have fun.

42:23.114 --> 42:25.172
We're gonna clean this place up.

42:25.197 --> 42:27.094
We're gonna get it nice and beautiful.

42:27.119 --> 42:31.068
What is fun about hiking two
miles to clean a tennis court?

42:32.405 --> 42:34.986
Listen, it's not about the work.

42:35.011 --> 42:37.744
It's about us working together as a team.

42:38.527 --> 42:40.473
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

42:41.110 --> 42:42.739
It's like you're brainwashed.

42:48.202 --> 42:49.202
Okay.

42:49.334 --> 42:50.912
We'll start on this end,

42:50.937 --> 42:52.999
and we gotta work our way back.

42:53.024 --> 42:54.246
Let's do it!

43:24.903 --> 43:26.048
Hey, Meghan.

43:26.384 --> 43:27.384
Everything okay?

43:27.407 --> 43:27.935
No.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.268
What do kids learn from hiking two miles

43:30.293 --> 43:32.222
up to a tennis court covered in weeds?

43:32.247 --> 43:33.324
And guess what?

43:33.349 --> 43:36.419
Here are some gloves and shovels
and let's clean the tennis court

43:36.444 --> 43:38.290
and learn about the good lord.

43:38.315 --> 43:39.282
Hmm!

43:39.307 --> 43:40.324
Calm down.

43:40.349 --> 43:42.348
I am not going to calm down!

43:42.373 --> 43:44.731
Why don't you just sign this document?

43:44.756 --> 43:46.315
Just give up already.

43:46.340 --> 43:48.622
There's nothing you can do
to save this land.

43:48.647 --> 43:51.342
Ok, I get it that you are a man
of God and you live off this and,

43:51.367 --> 43:53.986
but I don't see a miracle that's
gonna come out of the sky

43:54.011 --> 43:55.674
and save this place!

43:57.013 --> 43:58.013
You done?

43:58.352 --> 43:59.170
No.

43:59.276 --> 44:00.548
Do you want more money?

44:00.573 --> 44:03.069
'Cause if you want more money,
I can get you more money.

44:03.094 --> 44:04.025
What is it that you want?

44:04.050 --> 44:05.517
Ms. Doherty,

44:06.368 --> 44:07.644
We have an agreement.

44:07.669 --> 44:09.649
I plan to stick to my end
if you stick to yours.

44:09.674 --> 44:14.357
Now if you don't get back
to your group, deal's off.

44:36.652 --> 44:38.340
Well, welcome back!

44:54.017 --> 44:56.589
I need a facial
and a makeover so bad.

44:56.614 --> 44:57.818
Wow!

44:57.843 --> 44:59.577
You look so different.

44:59.602 --> 45:01.563
You look really pretty
without makeup.

45:03.704 --> 45:07.389
Ugh! My body hurts so bad.

45:10.804 --> 45:13.065
Have you ever had a facial or?

45:13.090 --> 45:14.724
No. No.

45:15.336 --> 45:16.391
Sit right there.

45:20.570 --> 45:21.570
'Kay.

45:27.099 --> 45:29.550
You have pretty healthy skin.
You should take care of it.

45:29.584 --> 45:31.219
Oh, I wash it with soap.

45:31.244 --> 45:32.290
Soap?

45:34.196 --> 45:37.051
Soap is the harshest
thing on a lady's skin.

45:37.957 --> 45:39.853
My friend Valentina and I,

45:39.878 --> 45:42.427
we get a facial once a week.

45:42.507 --> 45:43.633
Oh.

45:45.392 --> 45:48.212
I feel like my face is cracking.

45:52.843 --> 45:53.950
Wanna see?

46:10.768 --> 46:12.362
Good morning!

46:15.905 --> 46:17.251
What time is it?

46:17.876 --> 46:18.923
5:45.

46:20.911 --> 46:22.737
Why do we have to get up
so early?

46:23.089 --> 46:27.115
"Early to bed, early to rise, makes
a girl healthy, wealthy, and wise."

46:27.723 --> 46:30.178
All right, I know that's not in the Bible.

46:30.995 --> 46:32.286
How did you sleep?

46:32.311 --> 46:33.805
Gosh, last night was so special.

46:33.830 --> 46:35.850
Just, it was like...

46:35.875 --> 46:37.689
almost like I had a sister.

46:41.039 --> 46:42.039
Ouh!

46:42.169 --> 46:43.480
Oh, are you okay?

46:44.254 --> 46:47.189
It feels like someone's
poured concrete down my back.

46:47.214 --> 46:48.296
Oh no!

46:48.868 --> 46:52.090
Listen, why don't you just go ahead

46:52.115 --> 46:55.748
and tell Mr. Graham that I can't get
out of bed because my back hurts.

46:55.773 --> 46:56.981
Just go ahead.

46:57.006 --> 46:58.006
Okay.

47:32.946 --> 47:34.453
<I>Hello, Meghan?</I>

47:35.399 --> 47:36.659
My... uh...

47:36.830 --> 47:39.303
My dad asked me
to come check on you.

47:44.461 --> 47:46.250
Meghan, are you all right?

47:49.740 --> 47:51.969
I'm gonna come in.
Are you dressed?

47:53.348 --> 47:54.448
Ouh!

47:55.722 --> 47:56.824
Ouh!

47:57.997 --> 47:58.997
Are you okay?

48:01.405 --> 48:02.226
I'm all right. I...

48:02.251 --> 48:04.182
just strained my back from
pulling weeds yesterday.

48:04.207 --> 48:07.166
I thought I had some
Ibuprofen in the car.

48:07.191 --> 48:09.249
Well come on, let's
get you some aspirin.

48:09.695 --> 48:12.956
You wouldn't happen to know where
there would be a phone I could use.

48:12.981 --> 48:14.192
Um, yeah, well,

48:14.217 --> 48:16.493
the only phone's in my father's office.

48:16.525 --> 48:20.124
Other than that, the closest phone's
about 10 miles away in the nearest town.

48:20.529 --> 48:22.102
I could ask him if you like.

48:22.127 --> 48:23.127
Oh, no.

48:23.170 --> 48:25.410
I guess I could drive you to
town if it's that important.

48:25.538 --> 48:27.121
Yes, it is that important.

48:27.146 --> 48:28.777
Just far enough until I
get some cell signal,

48:28.802 --> 48:30.605
and then I could make the call.

48:30.968 --> 48:31.968
Yeah, sure.

48:31.973 --> 48:34.254
Come on. We'll take my car
and we'll be back before lunch.

48:34.259 --> 48:35.358
Yeah, all right.

48:57.556 --> 48:59.338
Where are you guys headed?

48:59.363 --> 49:01.239
Oh, she needed to make an
important call and use the phone.

49:01.264 --> 49:03.502
I didn't want to bother you.

49:04.509 --> 49:06.084
Is that right, Meghan?

49:06.354 --> 49:07.354
Yeah.

49:07.685 --> 49:08.939
That's right.

49:17.601 --> 49:18.657
You okay?

49:19.052 --> 49:21.717
Yeah. All of a sudden
I just feel sick.

49:23.342 --> 49:26.101
Maybe Carol can help her
with her sudden sickness.

49:26.528 --> 49:28.545
You know, I think I'll be okay.

49:28.570 --> 49:30.721
I just need to sit down and rest.

49:44.943 --> 49:47.111
Run! Run!

49:47.504 --> 49:49.824
Come back! Come on,
come on. Come back! Come on.

49:53.066 --> 49:54.480
Let's go!

49:55.269 --> 49:56.376
Come on!

50:00.393 --> 50:02.761
Run, run! Go, go! Come on!

50:04.906 --> 50:07.270
We would have won if I didn't
have to run two legs of the race.

50:07.295 --> 50:10.775
Yeah, what's her problem?
She scared of breaking a nail?

50:18.434 --> 50:19.905
So how do you feel?

50:20.280 --> 50:22.070
I still feel a little dizzy.

50:23.002 --> 50:24.450
I understand if you wanna leave, but...

50:24.475 --> 50:26.032
I wasn't trying to leave.

50:26.057 --> 50:28.303
I will be here until next Saturday,

50:28.328 --> 50:30.935
'Cause we agreed
that you would sign that deed.

50:30.960 --> 50:33.338
And I'll be here to
personally hand it to you.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.564
It sure looked like you
were trynna leave today.

50:35.589 --> 50:37.485
I wasn't trying to leave.

50:37.510 --> 50:38.633
I was making a call.

50:38.658 --> 50:41.085
My job is at stake and I needed
to let Mr. Whitaker know

50:41.110 --> 50:43.284
it's taking a lot longer than I thought.

50:43.629 --> 50:44.773
Meghan,

50:44.798 --> 50:46.814
the point is to leave that behind.

50:47.095 --> 50:49.135
You being here is about resting

50:49.160 --> 50:51.064
and getting in touch with God.

50:51.353 --> 50:53.466
Calling Whitaker is not gonna change that

50:53.491 --> 50:54.959
or speed up the process.

50:55.202 --> 50:57.228
You are just so in control.

50:58.327 --> 50:59.984
But you know what I've figured out?

51:00.009 --> 51:04.768
You're the only one who knows
how bad things are around here.

51:05.543 --> 51:08.372
And you're the only one who knows that

51:08.397 --> 51:10.266
this may be the last week

51:10.291 --> 51:12.327
this place is in business.

51:13.397 --> 51:16.483
Wonder how your family
would feel if they found out.

51:18.899 --> 51:20.254
You threatening me?

51:31.204 --> 51:33.788
<i>You've reached Meghan Doherty.
Please leave a message.</i>

51:34.734 --> 51:36.274
Meghan, hey, it's me.

51:36.299 --> 51:38.401
I've been calling for three days now.

51:38.994 --> 51:41.315
No one in God's Country
is answering the phone.

51:41.340 --> 51:46.044
So, if you had closed the deal you
would haves called by now, right?

51:46.389 --> 51:48.321
I'm really getting worried.

51:51.199 --> 51:53.731
Hola, Meghan, soy yo.
It's Valentina.

51:54.684 --> 51:56.848
I wish you would just
pick up the phone.

51:57.386 --> 52:00.334
We are all trying to locate you.

52:01.780 --> 52:03.890
I really hope that

52:03.915 --> 52:07.465
Your not calling has anything to do
with our discussion the other night.

52:08.456 --> 52:09.852
I'm so sorry.

52:11.305 --> 52:12.779
I miss you.

52:14.134 --> 52:16.170
Please, just...

52:16.195 --> 52:17.574
just call me back or,

52:17.599 --> 52:19.156
or call Adam, okay?

52:19.991 --> 52:21.003
All right.

52:21.603 --> 52:22.665
Bye.

52:50.264 --> 52:51.447
<I>Nice!</I>

52:54.636 --> 52:56.669
You know what, I was
just thinking something.

52:58.499 --> 53:00.190
When I was a kid growing up
in California,

53:00.215 --> 53:03.392
one of the things
that I remember the most

53:03.417 --> 53:06.174
was spending the holidays
together with my family.

53:06.199 --> 53:07.710
And even though we were
all packed in there,

53:07.735 --> 53:09.889
it was a tiny little two-Bedroom house,

53:09.914 --> 53:11.521
- I was the runt,
- Rightfully so!

53:11.546 --> 53:12.194
Right?

53:12.219 --> 53:13.449
I slept on the floor.

53:13.474 --> 53:15.343
I had my brother here,
I had my sister here,

53:15.368 --> 53:17.258
these cousins everywhere.

53:18.461 --> 53:19.925
I never felt crowded.

53:20.958 --> 53:22.158
Never.

53:23.367 --> 53:24.666
You know what I felt?

53:24.691 --> 53:25.764
I felt love.

53:25.789 --> 53:28.428
I felt togetherness.

53:29.657 --> 53:31.709
I just don't think there's anything
that can replace that feeling,

53:31.734 --> 53:36.810
that feeling of being
together with your family.

53:36.835 --> 53:37.835
Amen.

53:39.097 --> 53:41.955
I think maybe we should
take a little moment here

53:41.980 --> 53:44.230
to realize how lucky we are

53:44.255 --> 53:47.297
to be here with each other.

53:49.153 --> 53:50.312
<I>Amen.</I>

53:50.337 --> 53:51.638
You know.

53:51.891 --> 53:52.891
Okay.

53:53.374 --> 53:54.466
All right.

54:02.548 --> 54:06.447
Guess I'm sorry if I got you
into any trouble this morning.

54:07.072 --> 54:10.326
No, you didn't get me
into any trouble.

54:12.069 --> 54:13.719
I do have a question for you.

54:14.583 --> 54:15.610
What's going on?

54:15.635 --> 54:19.224
Why is my father hovering over you
like a mother over a new born baby?

54:24.289 --> 54:28.492
When I came here I told
him that I needed help.

54:29.306 --> 54:32.729
And so he agreed to help me
and treat me like everyone else.

54:32.754 --> 54:35.770
Not being nosy,
but help you with what?

54:37.281 --> 54:39.932
Don't worry. I'm not
a drug addict or anything.

54:40.438 --> 54:41.918
I'm a workaholic.

54:43.394 --> 54:46.968
And so it's work that
I think about all the time

54:46.993 --> 54:49.703
and hence I'm up here for rest.

54:50.421 --> 54:53.147
Hence, no cell phones,
no computers,

54:53.172 --> 54:54.903
None of that stuff.

54:55.318 --> 54:57.228
That's what your dad's
been helping me with.

54:57.253 --> 55:00.633
Yeah, well, he can be bullheaded
and stubborn sometimes.

55:01.399 --> 55:02.794
Tell me about it.

55:05.738 --> 55:07.103
How's your back?

55:10.177 --> 55:11.977
You know, it's...

55:13.141 --> 55:14.904
still a little tight.

55:15.529 --> 55:18.750
But I think the aspirin
has helped ease the pain.

55:23.341 --> 55:24.519
So what do you...

55:26.490 --> 55:29.040
So tell me about Jake.

55:30.071 --> 55:32.815
I've been a counselor here since my
parents owned and ran the place.

55:32.840 --> 55:35.515
I left for a couple of years to go
to college and business school.

55:35.540 --> 55:39.098
And then I came back to help
my mother and father run it.

55:39.123 --> 55:41.246
Where did you go
to business school?

55:41.271 --> 55:42.271
Harvard.

55:44.963 --> 55:47.638
You went to Harvard business school?

55:47.663 --> 55:48.711
Yeah.

55:49.581 --> 55:53.100
What are you doing here
working as a counselor?

55:53.125 --> 55:54.438
Well, who needs Wall Street? You know.

55:54.463 --> 55:57.394
I came here to learn how to
build the perfect bonfire.

55:57.597 --> 56:00.579
Plus I make one heck of a smore.

56:08.330 --> 56:10.606
Listen, do you wanna
come with me?

56:10.631 --> 56:12.520
There's something
I wanna show you.

56:14.152 --> 56:15.341
Okay.

56:16.797 --> 56:20.553
So, this is my vision.

56:21.852 --> 56:24.819
I wanna build a Christian college
with full student housing.

56:24.844 --> 56:28.591
Uh, the campus will be a state of the art
college with full academic curriculum.

56:28.616 --> 56:31.131
And the students, they
can earn college credit

56:31.156 --> 56:33.932
and they can earn scholarships by
working at the camp during the summer.

56:33.957 --> 56:35.360
This, um...

56:35.385 --> 56:39.838
Well, this is a day care center for single
mothers who wanna attend college.

56:39.863 --> 56:41.450
This is student housing.

56:41.475 --> 56:42.602
Oh, and look at this.

56:42.627 --> 56:45.133
That's the student activity center.

56:46.436 --> 56:47.933
I'm impressed.

56:48.179 --> 56:49.594
Does your father know about this?

56:49.619 --> 56:51.006
Oh, yeah, of course he does.

56:51.031 --> 56:54.800
I mean, we spent thousands putting together a
business plan with some really solid projections.

56:54.825 --> 56:57.268
And we can get state funding, tax relief.

56:57.293 --> 56:58.486
But,

56:58.511 --> 57:00.798
I'm talking about building
an entire infrastructure here,

57:00.823 --> 57:05.141
I mean electricity, sewage, water, paving a
road that goes all the way to the highway.

57:06.762 --> 57:08.739
I'm sorry.
Am I boring you with this?

57:08.764 --> 57:10.149
No! No.

57:10.174 --> 57:12.830
So why haven't you
put this plan into action?

57:13.658 --> 57:15.540
Graham Estates is a nonprofit organization.

57:15.565 --> 57:17.957
It raises most of our funding
through church offerings.

57:17.982 --> 57:21.711
With the economy hitting
all churches, big and small,

57:21.736 --> 57:24.398
it's put our entire organization into flux.

57:24.423 --> 57:26.117
What we need is a venture
capitalist to invest,

57:26.142 --> 57:29.297
but so far efforts have
fallen on deaf ears.

57:29.322 --> 57:31.752
Our vision is not their vision.

57:31.777 --> 57:33.563
My family...

57:34.457 --> 57:37.564
We really believe in helping
those who need help.

57:38.463 --> 57:39.814
It's God's way.

57:45.921 --> 57:47.111
<i>Paperwork looks good.</I></i>

57:47.136 --> 57:50.255
<i>And we are ready to move forward
with Whitaker & Associates.</i>

57:50.280 --> 57:52.375
<i>Mr. Whitaker, one question:</i>

57:52.400 --> 57:53.664
<i>Where's Ms. Doherty?</i>

57:53.689 --> 57:54.374
Have you heard anything?

57:54.399 --> 57:55.968
Nothing. Adam,
I'm worried.

57:55.993 --> 57:58.579
<i>My brother thinks
she's very impressive.</i>

57:58.604 --> 58:00.087
It's been four days!

58:00.112 --> 58:01.348
Okay, hold on.

58:01.373 --> 58:03.117
- Ms. Doherty?
- Yes.

58:03.142 --> 58:05.085
Valentina hasn't heard anything.

58:05.110 --> 58:08.217
And she is. She is
very impressive indeed,

58:08.241 --> 58:11.272
And right now she's away.
She's handling...

58:11.297 --> 58:13.765
some very detailed business, but...

58:13.790 --> 58:16.397
I don't know what to do
or how to reach her.

58:16.422 --> 58:19.637
Why doesn't someone just drive down
there and make sure she's all right?

58:19.662 --> 58:22.984
I can assure you that
everything is going to plan

58:23.009 --> 58:26.317
and the closing will take place on time.

58:27.619 --> 58:29.274
How's the weather over there, Hoshi?

58:29.299 --> 58:32.387
Mr. Whitaker doesn't wanna
go down and interfere.

58:32.412 --> 58:35.652
He'd prefer for Meghan
to call in.

58:35.677 --> 58:37.962
She's working on some
really big deal for the firm.

58:37.987 --> 58:41.501
I don't know much about it though,
other than it's worth a lot of money.

58:41.526 --> 58:44.248
Forget Whitaker and how much
money this deal is worth.

58:44.273 --> 58:45.719
What if she's in trouble?

58:45.744 --> 58:47.199
What if she needs our help?

58:47.224 --> 58:49.170
<i>Anything could have
happened to her.</i>

58:49.195 --> 58:52.077
You get on that phone
and call the state police

58:52.102 --> 58:54.903
and place a Missing Persons Report.

58:55.546 --> 58:58.257
Don't just sit around
and do nothing.

58:58.282 --> 58:59.282
You hear me?

58:59.296 --> 59:00.247
Okay, well, look,

59:00.272 --> 59:03.149
Mr. Whitaker says if she doesn't
call in the next couple of days,

59:03.174 --> 59:04.965
he'll go down there himself.
All right?

59:04.990 --> 59:07.105
I gotta go, though.
Okay, bye.

59:08.633 --> 59:10.595
You can't keep putting this off.

59:10.620 --> 59:11.625
What are you going to do?

59:11.650 --> 59:13.155
I don't know.

59:13.180 --> 59:15.692
We've tried her cell many times.
There's no answer.

59:15.717 --> 59:17.751
Adam, our friend is missing.

59:18.182 --> 59:20.170
If you're not going
to call 911, I will.

59:20.582 --> 59:21.672
Well, you decide.

59:22.030 --> 59:24.210
If I call 911 and she's okay,

59:24.235 --> 59:27.220
I risk blowing her deal
and my job.

59:42.785 --> 59:43.727
How's your back?

59:43.752 --> 59:45.224
My back's doing good.

59:45.249 --> 59:47.173
Hey, Meghan, I could
use your help on this pull.

59:47.198 --> 59:48.301
No!

59:48.326 --> 59:50.191
Come on!

59:50.216 --> 59:51.628
You can do it.

59:51.645 --> 59:52.790
Meghan!

59:52.815 --> 59:55.328
Meghan! Meghan!

59:56.461 --> 59:58.601
Oh, wait a second.
Let me put my hair up.

59:59.446 --> 01:00:00.578
Bring it on, blondie!

01:00:00.603 --> 01:00:02.364
You're goin' down!

01:00:02.389 --> 01:00:04.169
You're goin' down.
You got nothing.

01:00:04.194 --> 01:00:06.724
<I>Grab your ropes, everybody!</I>

01:00:06.749 --> 01:00:08.571
<I>On your marks,

01:00:08.762 --> 01:00:09.385
Set!

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:10.554
Come on, Meg!

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:12.330
Pull!

01:00:14.052 --> 01:00:15.133
<I>Bring it on!</I>

01:00:17.194 --> 01:00:20.518
Okay, come on, come on!
One, two three! Pull!

01:00:20.543 --> 01:00:21.107
Come on, guys!

01:00:21.132 --> 01:00:23.191
One, two three! Pull!

01:00:23.216 --> 01:00:24.435
Pull harder!

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.493
- One, two, three...
- Come on guys!

01:00:26.518 --> 01:00:27.735
Pull!

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.508
One, two three! Pull!

01:00:36.183 --> 01:00:37.201
Great job!

01:00:43.092 --> 01:00:46.059
Meghan, he has never lost!
That is amazing!

01:00:47.412 --> 01:00:50.159
Victory, baby!
Victory!

01:00:54.931 --> 01:00:55.931
Great job.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:00:59.382
So this is it.

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:02.038
This is what it's all about.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.312
Wow!

01:01:06.072 --> 01:01:08.309
<i>This is your reward
for winning at tug-of-war.</i>

01:01:08.697 --> 01:01:10.832
<I>You didn't let me win, did you?</I>

01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:12.206
Trust me when I tell you this,

01:01:12.231 --> 01:01:14.598
I love to win too much
to allow you to win.

01:01:31.135 --> 01:01:32.442
Oh, I...

01:01:32.467 --> 01:01:33.409
I have to go.

01:01:33.434 --> 01:01:34.014
Stay on task...

01:01:34.039 --> 01:01:35.044
Wait.

01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:36.362
It's not personal.
It's business.

01:01:36.387 --> 01:01:37.901
Did I do something wrong?

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.839
Can you take me back to camp?

01:01:44.558 --> 01:01:45.330
Meghan,

01:01:45.355 --> 01:01:47.246
so, I spoke to a guy

01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:48.625
out at God's Country,

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:51.952
and he said that a Meghan
Doubtfire with a Ferrari

01:01:51.977 --> 01:01:54.409
has been out there
for the past five days.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.138
So what's goin' on?

01:01:57.473 --> 01:01:58.928
What have they done to you?

01:01:59.737 --> 01:02:02.663
Look, you know, I don't care
about the Yakamoto deal.

01:02:02.688 --> 01:02:05.799
But if I don't hear from you
by the end of the auction,

01:02:05.824 --> 01:02:07.254
I'm calling the police.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.563
So what do you do for a living?

01:02:09.588 --> 01:02:10.600
I'm in real estate.

01:02:10.625 --> 01:02:12.992
Oh, real estate.
That sounds interesting.

01:02:13.906 --> 01:02:15.648
I wanna major in civil law.

01:02:15.673 --> 01:02:19.632
My father's a lawyer, so I get to see
how he helps people out of tight spots.

01:02:19.927 --> 01:02:23.702
I can never see you as a
person who'd major in law.

01:02:23.727 --> 01:02:27.957
Why, 'cause I'm not
all glamorous like you?

01:02:30.734 --> 01:02:32.304
I always wanted to fit in
with the girls, you know.

01:02:32.329 --> 01:02:33.554
It's just,

01:02:33.579 --> 01:02:35.138
I have four brothers.

01:02:35.163 --> 01:02:37.310
It's just easier to play rough, you know?

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.476
I have an idea.

01:02:39.788 --> 01:02:43.618
Listen, why don't you come to
Los Angeles for a weekend with me?

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:44.833
Really?

01:02:46.106 --> 01:02:47.482
Yeah, we can...

01:02:47.507 --> 01:02:49.495
we can go shopping, and...

01:02:51.178 --> 01:02:56.882
Well, we could find
you a new hair style.

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:03.920
How does that sound?
We could have some girl time?

01:03:03.945 --> 01:03:05.989
You know, just do
a bunch of girl things.

01:03:06.014 --> 01:03:07.176
I would like that.

01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:08.201
Yeah?

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.596
Sounds like something my mother
and I would have done together.

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:12.455
Oh, where's your mother?

01:03:12.817 --> 01:03:14.379
She died last year.

01:03:15.942 --> 01:03:17.351
I'm sorry.

01:03:19.909 --> 01:03:22.243
My father died when
I was about your age.

01:03:23.584 --> 01:03:25.867
I did everything with him,
and then...

01:03:26.457 --> 01:03:29.049
When he died I just lost
interest in everything.

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:32.120
Hey, you know what?

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:34.093
You seem too nice to be a lawyer.

01:03:34.118 --> 01:03:36.761
All the lawyers I know
are just ruthless.

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:39.825
There's good and bad in
everything and everyone.

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:41.725
I wanna be a lawyer so I can...

01:03:42.234 --> 01:03:45.325
So I can fight for the people that
can't afford to fight for themselves.

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:47.399
You know, for example,

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:51.636
say there's this big bank that locks an
elderly couple into a bad mortgage,

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:55.101
and then tries to evict them from their
home for the money 'cause they're greedy.

01:03:55.718 --> 01:03:57.224
That's when I would swoop in,

01:03:57.249 --> 01:03:59.175
Superlawyer Extraordinaire,

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.114
coming in, saving the day,
saving the elderly couple,

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.416
punishes the bank,
does the right thing.

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.407
I don't know, I think
it'd be great.

01:04:24.648 --> 01:04:26.814
<i>I know this verse on greed.</i>

01:04:26.839 --> 01:04:28.756
<i>Isaiah 56:11.</i>

01:04:29.915 --> 01:04:33.663
"Yeah, they are greedy dogs
who can never have enough."

01:04:35.014 --> 01:04:37.649
"They are shepherds
that can not understand."

01:05:38.982 --> 01:05:40.792
Where are you, Meghan?

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:44.917
This is what I was talking about, Jake.

01:05:46.512 --> 01:05:48.554
Luke 10:23.

01:05:49.908 --> 01:05:52.155
<i>"blessed are the eyes
that see what you see."</i>

01:05:52.653 --> 01:05:53.527
How are you doing this morning?

01:05:53.552 --> 01:05:55.282
Great. Good to see you.

01:05:55.679 --> 01:05:56.512
Hey, Jake.

01:05:56.537 --> 01:05:57.048
Yeah.

01:05:57.073 --> 01:05:58.104
The truck. Where is it?

01:05:58.129 --> 01:05:59.053
<I>Uh, right in front of the office.</I>

01:05:59.078 --> 01:06:00.172
- Keys inside?
<I>- yup.</I>

01:06:00.197 --> 01:06:01.251
Thanks, man.

01:06:04.076 --> 01:06:05.302
<I>Come in, Meghan.</I>

01:06:07.917 --> 01:06:08.917
Eden?

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.864
Hi, Meghan.
Have a seat.

01:06:11.985 --> 01:06:13.710
I have a confession to make.

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:19.190
Mr. Whitaker didn't send me
down here just to make an offer.

01:06:19.215 --> 01:06:21.384
There's a pair of businessmen,
the Yakamoto brothers,

01:06:21.409 --> 01:06:23.585
and they're here to develop the land.

01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:26.452
They want to turn it
into a casino and resort.

01:06:26.477 --> 01:06:28.557
It's a $100 million deal
and I don't see any way

01:06:28.582 --> 01:06:29.931
that you could stop it from happening,

01:06:29.956 --> 01:06:33.546
especially since tomorrow is the auction.

01:06:35.402 --> 01:06:37.157
Thanks for
the information, Meghan.

01:06:38.719 --> 01:06:40.705
There's nothing left
for me to do but pray.

01:06:41.334 --> 01:06:43.008
Will you stop it?

01:06:43.397 --> 01:06:45.514
Right now is the decision!

01:06:45.539 --> 01:06:47.849
Mr. Whitaker is gonna come
down the road any second now

01:06:47.874 --> 01:06:50.104
and just shut down
the entire operation,

01:06:50.129 --> 01:06:51.534
including me.

01:06:54.146 --> 01:06:55.416
I get it.

01:06:55.441 --> 01:06:56.851
I understand.

01:06:56.876 --> 01:06:59.946
There is something really
special about this land.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.481
But you have to be proactive.

01:07:03.676 --> 01:07:08.224
Jake shared with me the entire vision that you
have to be able to build a Christian college.

01:07:08.249 --> 01:07:10.331
You gotta find someone to invest in it,

01:07:10.356 --> 01:07:13.869
to pay up the debt, to buy this land so
you can put this camp back in operation.

01:07:13.894 --> 01:07:15.190
I've tried everything.

01:07:15.215 --> 01:07:17.120
I've called everyone
I know with money

01:07:17.145 --> 01:07:18.458
that could maybe bail me out,

01:07:18.483 --> 01:07:20.094
but so far, no one.

01:07:20.841 --> 01:07:23.309
All I have left is my faith in God.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.152
Don't you understand?

01:07:26.177 --> 01:07:27.633
That's all I have left.

01:07:27.658 --> 01:07:29.897
But what about Jake
and everyone else?

01:07:31.652 --> 01:07:33.008
Jake trusts you.

01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:37.577
He trusts that you and him are
going to complete this vision.

01:07:43.822 --> 01:07:45.464
You're right. You're right.

01:07:45.489 --> 01:07:46.840
You're right about the whole situation.

01:07:46.865 --> 01:07:47.903
Just...

01:07:49.914 --> 01:07:50.930
Yeah.

01:07:50.955 --> 01:07:53.286
You know what? I'm gonna
tell my family tonight.

01:07:53.311 --> 01:07:56.074
It's not fair to hide things
from the ones you love.

01:07:57.132 --> 01:07:58.032
It's just not fair.

01:07:58.057 --> 01:07:59.177
They have the right to know.

01:07:59.192 --> 01:08:00.211
You're right.

01:08:00.236 --> 01:08:00.986
Okay.

01:08:01.011 --> 01:08:02.613
No. I want you
to come with me.

01:08:09.917 --> 01:08:11.687
Can I have your attention, everyone?

01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:22.801
In John chapter 8,
the passage states,

01:08:22.827 --> 01:08:26.175
"Then you will know the truth,
and the truth will set you free."

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:31.447
Well, I have a confession to
make about God's Country.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.337
We're in foreclosure.

01:08:34.478 --> 01:08:36.926
<i>And as of Saturday
we will be no more.</i>

01:08:37.453 --> 01:08:40.859
<i>The land will got to auction
to the highest bidder.</i>

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.475
But the good news is,

01:08:44.501 --> 01:08:46.710
they made us an offer,
and with the money,

01:08:46.734 --> 01:08:49.273
<i>we'll be able to
start over in a new city.</i>

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.975
Sure we can start over
in a different city, but...

01:08:53.001 --> 01:08:54.237
I love this land.

01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:55.353
Wait.

01:08:55.377 --> 01:08:57.548
Why can't just call the bank and ask
'em to work something out with us?

01:08:57.573 --> 01:08:59.185
Because I am the bank.

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:03.492
And...

01:09:03.517 --> 01:09:05.904
my boss won't bail you out of debt.

01:09:06.582 --> 01:09:10.826
There are some businessmen and they have
made a very large offer for the land. Jake!

01:09:11.622 --> 01:09:12.278
You lied to me.

01:09:12.303 --> 01:09:13.673
I didn't lie to you.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.551
I just didn't know how to tell you.

01:09:15.576 --> 01:09:18.345
Lying and not telling are
the same thing to me.

01:09:31.322 --> 01:09:32.416
Jake.

01:09:33.066 --> 01:09:34.156
Wait!

01:09:38.912 --> 01:09:40.131
It's not her fault.

01:09:40.157 --> 01:09:41.792
Yeah? Then whose fault is it?

01:09:41.817 --> 01:09:43.652
You hid this from me!
What about the college?

01:09:43.676 --> 01:09:45.457
<i>What about the vision
that we had?</i>

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:47.115
Son, I know...

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.282
Know what?

01:09:48.307 --> 01:09:50.631
That we're losing everything that we've worked
for and you didn't have enough respect for me

01:09:50.656 --> 01:09:52.361
or the workers to tell us?

01:10:11.205 --> 01:10:12.315
Meghan, how...

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.383
how could you do this to us?

01:10:14.408 --> 01:10:15.872
Geri, it's not her fault.

01:10:16.685 --> 01:10:18.186
<I>She's just doing her job.</I>

01:10:19.418 --> 01:10:21.282
Eden, how did all this happen?

01:10:21.944 --> 01:10:24.045
I tried everything I could to stop this.

01:10:27.011 --> 01:10:28.225
But uh...

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:29.402
our time is short.

01:10:29.427 --> 01:10:32.687
I meet with Ms. Doherty tomorrow

01:10:32.712 --> 01:10:34.444
to finalize the paperwork.

01:10:34.949 --> 01:10:36.092
So, um,

01:10:37.745 --> 01:10:39.538
Let's enjoy the rest of the camp.

01:10:39.563 --> 01:10:41.855
Pastor, could you lead us in prayer?

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.880
Sure.

01:10:47.649 --> 01:10:49.613
Dear heavenly father,

01:10:49.638 --> 01:10:52.786
we ask for your guidance
and your wisdom,

01:10:53.401 --> 01:10:56.334
and that you may pour
your blessing upon your work,

01:10:56.359 --> 01:10:58.206
your land,

01:10:59.401 --> 01:11:01.077
and your people.

01:11:05.998 --> 01:11:07.612
In Jesus' name we pray.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.435
Amen.

01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:10.783
Amen.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:17.239
It's okay.

01:11:17.654 --> 01:11:18.692
I'm sorry.

01:11:57.069 --> 01:11:58.085
Hey.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.376
You know, as long as I can remember,

01:12:09.401 --> 01:12:13.105
this's been my spot to come
get away from the world,

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:16.844
clear my mind from any worries, doubts,

01:12:17.793 --> 01:12:18.816
Fears.

01:12:21.602 --> 01:12:22.729
I'm sorry.

01:12:25.832 --> 01:12:28.490
I didn't mean to mislead
you why I was here.

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:32.590
I'm just doing my job.

01:12:33.398 --> 01:12:34.344
I should have known.

01:12:34.369 --> 01:12:35.457
Right? Like,

01:12:35.482 --> 01:12:37.015
who drives up here in a Ferrari?

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.226
It's gotta be a banker or a lawyer,

01:12:39.251 --> 01:12:41.025
somebody self-oriented.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.572
Yeah, that would be me.

01:12:44.246 --> 01:12:47.680
I was exactly that person you
just described when I came here.

01:12:47.844 --> 01:12:49.807
I was on a mission
to close on this deal

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.222
and get back in time

01:12:51.247 --> 01:12:53.420
to have drinks with
my friends in the city.

01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:57.820
But something changed.

01:13:00.022 --> 01:13:02.480
After seeing all this,

01:13:02.505 --> 01:13:04.777
and you sharing your...

01:13:04.802 --> 01:13:06.732
your vision with me,

01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:07.728
and meeting everyone,

01:13:07.753 --> 01:13:11.537
I understand why your father
doesn't wanna part with this land.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.705
This really is God's Country!

01:13:18.693 --> 01:13:20.824
Look, I know I can't blame you,

01:13:21.943 --> 01:13:23.785
but I don't have to like it.

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:04.608
I'm sorry.

01:14:04.633 --> 01:14:05.966
I'm so sorry.

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:08.097
I feel so bad.

01:14:09.816 --> 01:14:10.816
Don't.

01:14:11.775 --> 01:14:14.125
I realize that you were
just doing your job.

01:14:14.602 --> 01:14:15.993
And...

01:14:17.113 --> 01:14:20.461
that I need to forgive you
like Jesus would have.

01:14:25.298 --> 01:14:27.112
Do you wanna forgive me?

01:14:27.991 --> 01:14:29.218
Yes.

01:14:29.243 --> 01:14:30.741
Yes, I do. I...

01:14:31.872 --> 01:14:34.283
I really enjoyed
what we shared together.

01:14:34.609 --> 01:14:38.458
And I learned that there's a
lesson in every part of life

01:14:38.483 --> 01:14:42.699
and it is not your fault
that this camp is broke.

01:14:42.724 --> 01:14:46.895
That's something that Jake and
Eden and Caroline have to deal with.

01:14:47.326 --> 01:14:49.129
So...

01:14:49.831 --> 01:14:51.614
I'm gonna go for a walk.

01:14:51.647 --> 01:14:53.709
May I come for a walk with you?

01:14:55.865 --> 01:14:57.365
I'd rather be by myself.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.162
I just...

01:14:59.187 --> 01:15:00.893
I've a lot to think about.

01:15:17.731 --> 01:15:19.851
<i>You've reached Meghan Doherty.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:15:20.764 --> 01:15:22.434
<I>Meghan, Whitaker's furious.</I>

01:15:22.459 --> 01:15:24.937
<i>He plans to come out there
if you don't call in.</i>

01:15:24.962 --> 01:15:26.767
<i>Your job's at stake.</i>

01:15:26.958 --> 01:15:29.149
<i>I hope you're doing
the right thing.</i>

01:15:33.672 --> 01:15:37.826
I should just close
the deal and walk away.

01:15:39.258 --> 01:15:40.174
That's all you have to do.

01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:41.749
You've done it a million times before

01:15:41.774 --> 01:15:43.437
and it's gotten you a Ferrari,

01:15:43.462 --> 01:15:45.287
a home out in the Hollywood Hills.

01:15:45.312 --> 01:15:47.506
I mean, what more do you need?

01:15:48.052 --> 01:15:51.274
Who cares if I've taken away
everything they care about?

01:15:54.867 --> 01:15:56.727
When have I ever cared before?

01:16:00.464 --> 01:16:02.170
Meghan, just stay on task.

01:16:03.485 --> 01:16:05.914
It's not personal. It's...

01:16:05.939 --> 01:16:07.176
It's business.

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:11.805
It's business.

01:16:18.803 --> 01:16:20.803
Hey, pastor Tinsley!

01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:25.671
Meghan.

01:16:26.946 --> 01:16:28.517
How do you feel today?

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:29.602
Confused.

01:16:30.347 --> 01:16:31.887
Okay, I'm listening.

01:16:31.912 --> 01:16:34.829
Yesterday I felt so bad, and...

01:16:35.558 --> 01:16:36.600
today is the last day,

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:40.594
and I just feel like the executioner.

01:16:41.693 --> 01:16:42.518
You're a good servant.

01:16:42.543 --> 01:16:45.305
That's all God wants us to be
is good servants.

01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:48.317
I guess I've just been experiencing this...

01:16:48.342 --> 01:16:51.209
overwhelming amount of guilt
these last few days.

01:16:51.763 --> 01:16:53.479
If it's God's will,

01:16:53.504 --> 01:16:54.857
then it's his will.

01:16:55.447 --> 01:16:56.598
You're only his messenger.

01:16:56.623 --> 01:16:59.148
I just feel like there's
something that I should do.

01:16:59.173 --> 01:17:01.726
If this is God's will
then it's his will.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:08.736
Good luck.

01:17:12.407 --> 01:17:13.932
Everybody ready?

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:43.685
Hey! Jake!

01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:45.578
Jake! Jake!

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:47.209
- What?
- Jake, listen.

01:17:47.241 --> 01:17:49.370
Grab your truck
and come with me.

01:17:49.785 --> 01:17:50.451
What's going on?

01:17:50.476 --> 01:17:53.161
I don't have time to explain.
Just follow me.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.277
Listen, Jake, I know you don't
trust me, but I have an idea.

01:17:57.302 --> 01:17:59.571
Had enough of your ideas,
okay? Why should I trust you?

01:17:59.596 --> 01:18:02.544
You standing here mad at me
is not going to save this land.

01:18:02.569 --> 01:18:05.302
You... let's go to your room
get your business plan.

01:18:05.327 --> 01:18:06.678
I have an idea!

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:11.636
If you don't trust me,
then trust God.

01:18:14.152 --> 01:18:15.202
Come on.

01:18:15.836 --> 01:18:18.148
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:18:39.179 --> 01:18:40.940
Meghan, OMG!
Where are you?

01:18:40.965 --> 01:18:41.973
We've been worried sick!

01:18:41.998 --> 01:18:43.186
<i>Adam, I'm fine.</i>

01:18:43.211 --> 01:18:45.023
<i>Tell Whitaker nothing, okay?</i>

01:18:45.048 --> 01:18:46.743
I can't just do that.

01:18:46.768 --> 01:18:48.973
Look, you fell off the face of the earth.
We all have questions.

01:18:48.998 --> 01:18:51.663
<i>Call jason and tell him that
I am on my way bearing gifts.</i>

01:18:51.688 --> 01:18:52.479
<I>Okay, my friend?</I>

01:18:52.504 --> 01:18:54.028
Yeah, okay.

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:00.201
My car.

01:19:00.226 --> 01:19:01.521
Take it. It's yours.

01:19:01.546 --> 01:19:04.960
Jason, you told me that if I had
a great opportunity, you wanted in.

01:19:04.985 --> 01:19:05.718
This is it.

01:19:05.743 --> 01:19:06.743
What is it?

01:19:07.419 --> 01:19:08.861
It's the future.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.351
I hope you have your check book.

01:19:21.013 --> 01:19:21.463
Hello.

01:19:21.488 --> 01:19:24.026
<i>Mr. Whitaker, we can
no longer wait.</i>

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:26.193
<i>I thought you said the deal
would be closed by today.</i>

01:19:26.218 --> 01:19:28.449
Hoshi, relax.

01:19:28.474 --> 01:19:29.836
I gave you my word.

01:19:29.861 --> 01:19:31.406
You know how these lawyers work,

01:19:31.431 --> 01:19:34.227
Going over all that paperwork.
It takes some time.

01:19:34.252 --> 01:19:36.526
<I>I understand that, Mr. Whitaker,</I>

01:19:36.551 --> 01:19:38.111
<I>but we had a deal,</I>

01:19:38.136 --> 01:19:40.565
<I>and we agreed upon a deadline.</I>

01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:42.772
- Yeah, but...
<I>- I'll wait for your call.</I>

01:19:55.712 --> 01:19:57.106
All right, gather around, folks.

01:19:57.131 --> 01:19:59.972
<i>We're gonna start the auction
in about five minutes.</i>

01:20:00.534 --> 01:20:05.268
<i>Now, what you're gonna be bidding
on is 1,000 acres of God's Country.</i>

01:20:05.293 --> 01:20:07.359
Please, serious bidders only,

01:20:07.384 --> 01:20:10.002
Includes three nice trailers,

01:20:10.027 --> 01:20:13.629
lovely little log cabin,
and a private lake.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.546
All right,

01:20:16.571 --> 01:20:19.195
we'll start the bidding at 75,000.

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:23.866
Wait!

01:20:23.891 --> 01:20:26.066
- 1000 acres of...
- No no no no! Wait! wait! Wait!

01:20:26.091 --> 01:20:27.183
I got it.

01:20:27.208 --> 01:20:29.474
I got the payment.
Here you go.

01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:34.122
I'm with Whitaker & Associates and
I hereby present to you the payment

01:20:34.147 --> 01:20:37.044
to restore the land into good standing.

01:20:38.371 --> 01:20:40.695
Everything seems to be in order.

01:20:41.156 --> 01:20:43.591
Sorry, folks, no auction today.

01:20:47.741 --> 01:20:48.741
Thanks.

01:20:53.024 --> 01:20:54.903
Meghan,

01:20:54.928 --> 01:20:59.343
I hope that smile is because Whitaker
& Associates is closed on this land.

01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:04.294
No.

01:21:05.383 --> 01:21:06.992
We have a new partner.

01:21:08.108 --> 01:21:10.254
God's Country is gonna survive,

01:21:10.279 --> 01:21:13.348
so we can continue to
save lives and give back.

01:21:13.373 --> 01:21:17.065
Do you think the world needs another casino
to take people's money and destroy families?

01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:19.064
Why couldn't you build something
that gives back to mankind?

01:21:19.089 --> 01:21:22.005
Meghan, you gotta be kidding me.

01:21:22.535 --> 01:21:25.040
No, I'm not, sir.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:28.547
After spending time here and seeing
what this land was really about,

01:21:28.572 --> 01:21:32.587
I realized I could not be a part
of building a casino out here.

01:21:32.612 --> 01:21:35.823
There are so many other pieces
of land in this vast desert

01:21:35.848 --> 01:21:39.161
where the Yakamoto brothers
can build their casino on.

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:42.443
This little piece of land,
this is too valuable,

01:21:42.468 --> 01:21:45.631
to this camp, to these people,

01:21:47.012 --> 01:21:48.425
And now me.

01:21:52.638 --> 01:21:54.955
You know what?

01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:56.340
You're fired.

01:21:56.897 --> 01:21:57.778
I know.

01:21:57.803 --> 01:22:00.495
Meghan, I trusted you

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:03.526
to come up here
and do the right thing!

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:06.134
And you crossed me?

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:07.739
I did do the right thing,

01:22:07.764 --> 01:22:12.442
and it took being up here at God's Country
and this land to finally realize that.

01:22:12.939 --> 01:22:16.936
Now if you'll excuse me,
we have a college to build.

01:22:39.713 --> 01:22:43.329
Man, I can not believe you
got rid of that sweet ride!

01:22:43.354 --> 01:22:46.827
Listen, I'm gonna be in Los
Angeles in a couple of weeks.

01:22:46.852 --> 01:22:49.348
Maybe I can come down
there and we can hang out.

01:22:49.373 --> 01:22:50.840
Promise.

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:51.865
Yes.

01:22:56.746 --> 01:22:58.280
Oh, stop it.

01:22:58.881 --> 01:22:59.875
I'm gonna go get the truck.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.115
All right.

01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:04.406
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:23:05.733 --> 01:23:07.809
I told you I want you to
come hang out with me.

01:23:07.834 --> 01:23:09.285
Yeah, but you're just saying that now.

01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:10.435
Promise.

01:23:10.692 --> 01:23:11.932
You're special.

01:23:13.995 --> 01:23:14.995
Thank you.

01:23:18.008 --> 01:23:21.134
Meghan, we're truly
gonna miss you.

01:23:22.512 --> 01:23:23.804
How did you know?

01:23:24.244 --> 01:23:25.544
I didn't.

01:23:25.569 --> 01:23:26.797
He did.

01:23:33.785 --> 01:23:34.945
You ready to go?

01:23:35.328 --> 01:23:36.602
I am.

01:23:45.826 --> 01:23:49.818
So, partner, you ready to take me back
to the hustle and bustle of city life?

01:23:49.843 --> 01:23:51.643
You know you're always
welcome to stay here.

01:23:51.668 --> 01:23:54.223
You can teach business
finance at the college.

01:23:54.248 --> 01:23:56.023
Trust me.

01:23:56.048 --> 01:23:58.344
I'll be back to check on my new venture.

01:23:58.368 --> 01:24:00.526
Especially since I'm officially unemployed.

01:24:00.551 --> 01:24:04.661
Yeah, well, I hope business isn't
the only reason you come back.

01:24:07.373 --> 01:24:08.324
How about I buy you dinner?

01:24:08.349 --> 01:24:11.156
You know, I know a
great sushi place.

01:24:11.181 --> 01:24:13.946
Hey, do you have
any plans tomorrow?

01:24:13.971 --> 01:24:16.495
Why? What do you
have in mind?

01:24:26.495 --> 01:24:27.512
Hello?

01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:29.598
Meghan!

01:24:33.357 --> 01:24:34.365
Oh.

01:24:35.076 --> 01:24:37.725
Well, I can't say
I'm not disappointed.

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:41.453
Well, I know that you're busy...

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.262
Meghan, can you wait a second?
There's someone at the door.

01:24:48.287 --> 01:24:49.606
Be right back.

01:24:55.705 --> 01:24:56.705
Ah!

01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:00.182
Yes?

01:25:00.207 --> 01:25:03.458
Hi. I have a delivery
for a Ms. Emma Doherty.

01:25:03.483 --> 01:25:04.020
That's me.

01:25:04.045 --> 01:25:05.201
Great. These are for you.

01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:06.506
Oh, thank you.

01:25:06.531 --> 01:25:07.300
Have a great day.

01:25:07.325 --> 01:25:08.750
- You too.
- Bye bye.

01:25:12.698 --> 01:25:14.376
Oh, Meghan.

01:25:18.785 --> 01:25:19.964
Okay, I'm back.

01:25:19.989 --> 01:25:24.107
I just received the flowers.
How beautiful! Thank you.

01:25:24.132 --> 01:25:26.198
At least you didn't
forget about me.

01:25:27.327 --> 01:25:29.726
Again? Please hold.

01:25:35.301 --> 01:25:35.994
Oh!

01:25:36.019 --> 01:25:37.502
Surprise!

01:25:37.784 --> 01:25:40.922
Oh, my God! Meghan!

01:25:41.983 --> 01:25:43.250
Oh, sweetheart!

01:25:44.128 --> 01:25:45.575
Happy birthday, mom.

01:25:46.345 --> 01:25:48.176
Oh! Thank you.

01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:49.730
Come in.

01:25:49.904 --> 01:25:51.604
Oh my God!

01:25:51.919 --> 01:25:53.065
Happy birthday!

01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:55.112
- You look beautiful!
- Thank you!

01:25:55.394 --> 01:25:57.369
- This is Jake.
- Hi, I'm Jake.

01:25:58.488 --> 01:25:59.360
Hi!

01:25:59.385 --> 01:26:00.818
Yeah, I know!

01:26:00.893 --> 01:26:02.035
Come in!

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:06.663
Oh, sweetheart,
I can't believe you did this!

01:26:08.348 --> 01:26:09.789
Hey, come on!

01:26:10.656 --> 01:26:12.754
I was so surprised!

01:26:13.243 --> 01:26:14.921
I just couldn't believe it. Oh.

01:26:14.946 --> 01:26:15.926
I actually got you
a little something.

01:26:15.951 --> 01:26:18.528
Jake, thank you.
That's very sweet of you.

01:26:18.553 --> 01:26:19.906
You're very welcome.

01:26:19.931 --> 01:26:21.415
Your daughter's very important to me

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.496
in the little time I've known her. So...

01:26:23.521 --> 01:26:25.587
That's so sweet. Thank you.

01:26:29.633 --> 01:26:31.907
Yay! Cake!

01:26:34.145 --> 01:26:35.862
Oh, look at that!

01:26:38.362 --> 01:26:40.500
Happy birthday, mom!

01:26:41.610 --> 01:26:42.794
You think it's big enough?

01:26:44.676 --> 01:26:46.882
I'm so glad you're here.

01:26:46.916 --> 01:26:47.916
Oh!

01:26:49.061 --> 01:26:51.858
Hey, you mean the world to me.

01:26:55.691 --> 01:26:57.191
Thanks, sweetie.

01:26:59.163 --> 01:27:00.965
Okay, now blow out your candles.

01:27:01.397 --> 01:27:03.647
Okay. Ready?
