37:48.320 --> 37:50.641
Ten is all I got. Help me out.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.601
Okay. Ten will get you this and no more.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.001
Okay, just tell me one thing.

37:55.080 --> 37:56.969
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

37:57.040 --> 37:58.769
Did it seem magical?

37:58.960 --> 38:00.450
(EXHALES) Yes!

38:01.200 --> 38:03.885
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.210

38:11.720 --> 38:12.721
Whoa! (GRUNTS)

No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.481
(GROANS)

38:22.560 --> 38:24.164
But I did find us a place to sleep.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.370
- And it's free.
-(SNORTS)

38:27.880 --> 38:29.291
I'm sorry about this violence.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.050
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

38:31.560 --> 38:32.891
so we have good feelings.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.730
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?

38:36.080 --> 38:37.161
Uh...

38:42.160 --> 38:44.242
(TUNE BEING PICKED ON LUTE)

Aw. Thanks, buddy.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.249

39:04.800 --> 39:07.565

What do you want?

39:30.280 --> 39:32.362
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.290
I don't take people places.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.685
Let me rephrase that.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.205
(GROANS) Hey.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.286
Take me up the North Mountain.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.801
- I like fast.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

40:23.920 --> 40:25.570
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.130
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

40:27.240 --> 40:28.526
-(SPITS)
- Ugh!

40:28.680 --> 40:31.286
- No, I was raised in a castle.
- Hmm.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.205
KRISTOFF: So, uh, tell me,

40:34.520 --> 40:36.443
what made the queen go all ice-crazy?

40:36.680 --> 40:37.681
Oh. Well...

40:38.200 --> 40:39.440
It was all my fault.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.047
I got engaged, but then she freaked out,

40:42.120 --> 40:44.771
because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.770
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

40:46.880 --> 40:50.362
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?

40:50.440 --> 40:53.683
Yeah.
Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,

40:53.760 --> 40:54.761
and then she tried to walk away,

40:54.840 --> 40:55.807
and I grabbed her glove...

40:55.880 --> 40:56.881
Hang on!

40:57.040 --> 40:58.929
You mean to tell me you got engaged

40:59.000 --> 41:01.606
to someone you just met that day?

41:01.680 --> 41:02.920
Yes. Pay attention.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.130
But the thing is,
she wore the gloves all the time,

41:06.200 --> 41:08.441
so I just thought,
maybe she has a thing about dirt.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.484
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

41:12.240 --> 41:13.969
Yes, they did.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.761
But Hans is not a stranger.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.850
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

41:18.960 --> 41:21.406
(SCOFFS) "Of the Southern lsles."

41:21.560 --> 41:22.891
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.331
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.447
- Eye color?
- Dreamy.

41:25.520 --> 41:27.010
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.286
Have you had a meal with him yet?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.845
What if you hate the way he eats?

41:29.920 --> 41:31.331
What if you hate
the way he picks his nose?

41:31.600 --> 41:32.601
Picks his nose?

41:32.880 --> 41:33.927
And eats it.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.401
Excuse me, sir. He is a prince.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.925
- All men do it.
- Ew.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.410
Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.721
It doesn't sound like true love.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.326
(SCOFFS) Are you some
sort of love expert?

41:47.080 --> 41:49.606
No. But, uh, I have friends who are.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.160
You have friends

41:51.240 --> 41:53.561
who are love experts? I'm not buying it.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.130

Stop it, Sven. I'm trying to focus, here.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.362
- Yeah. Why?
<i>- I'll</i> tell you why.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.445
We need Elsa to bring back summer.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.450
- Summer?
- Mmm-hmm.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.760
Oh. I don't know why,

47:23.840 --> 47:27.526
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

47:27.600 --> 47:31.082
And sun, and all things hot.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.201
Really?

47:32.280 --> 47:34.760
I'm guessing you
don't have much experience with heat.

47:34.840 --> 47:35.921
Nope.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.681
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,

47:38.760 --> 47:42.606
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.888

No, no. You've got the bark facing down.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.565
The bark needs to be face-up.

of Arendelle's tradable goods?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.331
Princess Anna has given her orders.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.129
And that's another thing!

that your princess may be conspiring

50:06.800 --> 50:07.926
with a wicked sorceress

50:08.120 --> 50:09.121
to destroy us all?

50:09.200 --> 50:10.770
Do not question the princess.

She left me in charge

50:12.480 --> 50:13.720
