00:00.083 --> 00:02.208
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.291 --> 00:04.750
I have another child, Lynette.

00:04.834 --> 00:06.625
You're the one that
gave me permission, remember?

00:06.709 --> 00:09.208
Not to sleep with the woman
who's carrying our child!

00:09.291 --> 00:11.041
<i>For some, love will wither...</i>

00:11.125 --> 00:14.333
- Do I know you?
- Orson Hodge. Susan's dentist friend.

00:14.417 --> 00:17.375
<i>...while others will wait for love.</i>

00:17.458 --> 00:20.291
<i>For others, new love will bloom</i>

00:25.709 --> 00:27.959
<i>that may never arrive.</i>

00:32.250 --> 00:36.917
<i>Something awful happened</i>
<i>on Lakeview Drive last year.</i>

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
<i>To understand why, you need to know</i>

00:40.083 --> 00:42.625
<i>that when Alma Hodge</i>
<i>awoke that morning,</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:47.333
<i>she had no idea this would be</i>
<i>the day she'd leave her husband.</i>

00:47.417 --> 00:50.291
<i>Certainly, it began normally enough.</i>

00:50.375 --> 00:53.792
<i>She put away the groceries</i>
<i>per his instructions.</i>

00:55.125 --> 00:58.959
<i>She hung his dry cleaning</i>
<i>exactly as he had requested.</i>

01:00.750 --> 01:04.083
<i>She folded the towels</i>
<i>just as he had taught her.</i>

01:06.417 --> 01:08.625
<i>It was just before noon...</i>

01:09.792 --> 01:13.125
Mama loves her baby.
Does the baby love Mama?

01:13.208 --> 01:14.500
Mama.

01:14.583 --> 01:17.417
<i>...when something inside Alma broke,</i>

01:17.500 --> 01:22.041
<i>and she decided</i>
<i>it was time to fly away.</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:27.166
<i>Of course, she knew better</i>
<i>than to say this to her husband.</i>

01:27.625 --> 01:30.000
<i>He thought Alma was happy.</i>

01:30.083 --> 01:34.750
<i>And Orson Hodge</i>
<i>did not like to be contradicted.</i>

01:35.333 --> 01:37.875
<i>So she waited till he'd left for work.</i>

01:39.417 --> 01:41.125
<i>And then...</i>

01:59.750 --> 02:02.667
Baby, you gotta come down now.
Mama's in a hurry.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.625
Hurry. Hurry.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.875
If you don't get back
in your cage right now,

02:08.959 --> 02:11.166
I'm gonna have to leave you behind.
Please!

02:33.000 --> 02:36.041
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>Carolyn Bigsby stopped by.</i>

02:36.125 --> 02:38.458
<i>And, like most nosy neighbours,</i>

02:38.583 --> 02:42.250
<i>she knew you learned more</i>
<i>if you didn't knock.</i>

02:42.333 --> 02:45.458
Alma? Are you home?

02:49.792 --> 02:53.041
- Carolyn?
- I was just looking for Alma.

02:53.125 --> 02:57.709
We had a coffee date this morning.
She never showed.

02:57.792 --> 03:01.166
- Alma left yesterday.
- Left?

03:01.250 --> 03:03.250
We had a bit of a row.

03:04.375 --> 03:07.041
Harvey and I thought
we heard some raised voices.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.125
So where'd she go?

03:09.709 --> 03:13.291
Don't know. But I wouldn't
worry about it. I'm sure she's fine.

03:13.375 --> 03:14.834
Orson, no.

03:18.083 --> 03:20.250
Orson, no.

03:25.875 --> 03:30.166
So if I hear from Alma,
I'll let her know that you dropped by.

03:41.333 --> 03:46.417
<i>Yes, Orson Hodge was a man</i>
<i>who did not like to be contradicted</i>

03:49.250 --> 03:51.208
<i>by anyone.</i>

03:59.792 --> 04:03.542
<i>It doesn't rain very often</i>
<i>in the town of Fairview.</i>

04:03.625 --> 04:07.625
<i>But when it does, it pours.</i>

04:08.709 --> 04:11.875
<i>It was on just such a day</i>
<i>that Bree Van De Kamp</i>

04:11.959 --> 04:16.291
<i>went on her first date</i>
<i>with her new friend, Orson Hodge,</i>

04:16.375 --> 04:20.792
<i>a date that ended</i>
<i>with a kiss in the rain.</i>

04:21.750 --> 04:24.875
<i>This occurred just as Gabrielle Solis</i>
<i>was conferring</i>

04:24.959 --> 04:26.875
<i>with her new divorce lawyer</i>

04:26.959 --> 04:32.375
<i>and describing, in vivid detail,</i>
<i>her husband's affair with their maid,</i>

04:32.458 --> 04:36.083
<i>who also happened to be</i>
<i>their surrogate.</i>

04:37.834 --> 04:40.625
<i>Meanwhile, Lynette Scavo was busy</i>

04:40.709 --> 04:43.917
<i>meeting her husband's</i>
<i>illegitimate daughter</i>

04:46.291 --> 04:50.208
<i>while resisting the urge</i>
<i>to strangle the girl's mother.</i>

04:52.125 --> 04:56.166
<i>This happened just after</i>
<i>Susan Mayer learned Mike Delfino</i>

04:56.250 --> 05:00.291
<i>had been badly injured</i>
<i>in a hit-and-run accident</i>

05:00.375 --> 05:04.250
<i>and was now in a coma</i>
<i>at Fairview Memorial Hospital.</i>

05:05.417 --> 05:09.834
<i>At that same moment, Edie Britt</i>
<i>was putting up a For Sale sign</i>

05:09.917 --> 05:14.083
<i>on the lawn of the house</i>
<i>where I once lived.</i>

05:14.208 --> 05:16.917
<i>Edie had also planned to</i>
<i>spruce up the property</i>

05:17.000 --> 05:19.500
<i>by washing down the driveway,</i>

05:19.583 --> 05:24.542
<i>but she was pleased to see</i>
<i>the rain had already taken care of that.</i>

05:25.834 --> 05:28.458
<i>This is what rainy days are good for.</i>

05:29.291 --> 05:31.625
<i>They make everything clean again,</i>

05:32.709 --> 05:37.250
<i>which is necessary</i>
<i>on a street like Wisteria Lane,</i>

05:37.667 --> 05:41.709
<i>where everything can get so messy.</i>

06:00.375 --> 06:03.667
Welcome, welcome.

06:03.750 --> 06:07.834
Don't worry about the water.
The floors are laminated. Here's a flyer.

06:07.917 --> 06:10.917
The police found her severed fingers
in the garage.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.083
- Oh, no.
- And they never found Felicia's body.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.792
I wouldn't be surprised if someday
you open a cabinet, and hello!

06:17.875 --> 06:21.291
Karen, dear.
Have you seen the marble backsplash?

06:21.375 --> 06:24.125
I just must show it to you. Excuse us.

06:24.208 --> 06:27.500
What are you trying to do to me,
you backstabbing cow?

06:27.583 --> 06:29.583
They asked why the owner was selling.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.500
I told them that Paul Young was in jail.

06:31.583 --> 06:35.333
They asked why.
Conversation has a flow.

06:35.417 --> 06:36.792
Well, knock it off.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.959
I've been trying to unload
this house of horrors for months now,

06:39.041 --> 06:40.875
and you are not helping.

06:41.375 --> 06:45.250
Those are for potential buyers,
you withered old mooch.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.125
Good luck trying to find one of those.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.583
Maybe you'll have an easier time
with the Applewhite house

06:49.667 --> 06:52.750
- and that rec room in the basement.
- Get out.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.750
Get out. Get out, get out, get out.

06:56.834 --> 07:00.917
- Edie? Do you have a moment, please?
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.625
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Guys.

07:05.709 --> 07:07.709
- Settle down.
- Come on!

07:08.959 --> 07:11.083
- Kayla ready yet?
- Just a sec.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.959
Honey, thank you for this.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.250
I know it's a little weird, I mean,

07:15.333 --> 07:17.750
to send out a family Christmas
photo with your husband's love child.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.792
But it means a lot to her
to feel included.

07:19.875 --> 07:23.291
No problem.
She's a great little girl. Okay?

07:23.375 --> 07:28.250
All right, let's do this.
I am just going to check the focus.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.375
- Nora.
- Lynette.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.834
What are you doing there?

07:37.917 --> 07:41.458
Well, it's a family photo, right?

07:42.834 --> 07:45.125
Tom, could I check your tie again?

07:47.375 --> 07:49.875
She sat down so quickly,
I didn't know what to say.

07:49.959 --> 07:52.959
How about,
"You're in the frame, bitch. Move."

07:53.291 --> 07:55.125
- Lynette...
- No, I am sorry.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.625
How much of her crap
do I have to put up with?

07:57.709 --> 07:59.083
First, it's little drop-bys,

07:59.166 --> 08:01.417
then she's inviting herself to dinner,
three times a week.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.417
Now, she wants to be in
our Christmas photo?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.041
I'm sorry. No, that's not happening.

08:05.125 --> 08:08.709
Hey, guys. Don't fight. It's the holidays.

08:10.875 --> 08:14.917
Nora, this is just for our family.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.667
I would prefer if you weren't in it.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.500
Okay.

08:26.792 --> 08:30.834
Kayla, honey, we gotta go.
They're kicking us out.

08:30.917 --> 08:33.750
We didn't say that Kayla
couldn't be in the photo.

08:33.834 --> 08:36.792
Yeah, well, you know what?
If I'm not your family,

08:36.875 --> 08:39.083
then she's not your family.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.709
It's okay.
I don't have to be in the picture.

08:47.291 --> 08:50.959
Fine. Fine. No, absolutely fine.

08:51.041 --> 08:53.959
Put Crazy at the end
and we will crop her out later.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.667
Fair enough. Hey, everything's okay.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.542
It's okay. Come on, guys.
Come on back.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.417
Thank you, Lynette.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.417
That's the Christmas spirit
that I was looking for.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.333
Ten seconds.

09:11.875 --> 09:15.667
I think this is a little stiff.
I have a really fun idea.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.792
Where are my crackers?

09:28.875 --> 09:32.000
We're out, but I got you a pickle.

09:32.083 --> 09:35.000
Pickles and soup? Who eats that?

09:35.125 --> 09:38.750
- You know, that's all we've got.
- Ever heard of a store?

09:45.333 --> 09:47.750
- You did not just do that.
- I hate pickles.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.125
Pick it up.

09:49.208 --> 09:52.333
Doctor say I only get out of bed to pee.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.291
Better for baby, remember?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.917
Don't go.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.208
I need you to rub my feet.

10:07.291 --> 10:11.041
- They're sore. And doctor say...
- Cut it out, Xiao Mei.

10:11.125 --> 10:14.041
The doctor didn't say anything
about rubbing your chubby stumps.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.500
Rub them yourself.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.625
You treat me like dirt.

10:19.625 --> 10:24.792
Would you rather go live with Mr Solis
in a dingy one-bedroom apartment

10:24.875 --> 10:27.667
with no air conditioning and no cable?

10:29.083 --> 10:31.041
No, I didn't think so.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.500
You are meanest person I know.

10:34.583 --> 10:37.917
I am the meanest person.
You've been in this country a year.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.125
- Modify your nouns, damn it.
- What a bitch.

10:47.166 --> 10:51.542
I can't wait for you to pop out that baby,
because when you do,

10:51.625 --> 10:54.208
I am putting you on the first plane
back to Shanghai.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.333
And you're gonna be on all fours
in a rice paddy

10:56.417 --> 10:58.917
before the epidural wears off.

11:00.125 --> 11:03.542
But you promised to get me apartment
in Chinatown,

11:03.625 --> 11:07.625
so I can work for my friend
in restaurant, start a new life.

11:08.083 --> 11:11.083
Tell it to my Chinese friend, Sue Me.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.667
You know, we do have people here
in the hospital who could do that.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.709
But I like doing it,
and I think Mike would want me to.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.250
So have you got the results
of his latest MRI yet?

11:38.333 --> 11:41.125
I'm afraid there was no change.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.625
Well, how long until
you can do another one?

11:43.709 --> 11:45.959
I don't wanna tell you
not to be optimistic, but...

11:46.041 --> 11:49.542
Look, I know it's been six months,
but he could still come out of it, right?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.333
I saw on the news
there was this woman in Peru,

11:51.417 --> 11:52.792
she woke up after 10 years.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.208
There's a reason that made the news.

11:55.291 --> 11:58.959
You might think I'm naive,
but I know he's coming back to me.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.792
- Susan...
- Don't say it.

12:00.875 --> 12:04.500
You just keep doing your job,
and I'll keep doing mine.

12:17.542 --> 12:20.166
That risotto was perfect.

12:21.166 --> 12:23.208
Just like you.

12:23.291 --> 12:26.333
Listen, I hope you saved room
for dessert.

12:26.417 --> 12:30.125
I got us something special from
a wonderful little bakery downtown.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.375
Oh.

12:34.125 --> 12:38.166
That is so adorable,
but I don't think I can eat another bite.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.417
Here, let me take half.

12:45.291 --> 12:48.583
What do you say, Bree?
Will you marry me?

12:53.333 --> 12:55.959
This is a little sudden, isn't it?

12:56.041 --> 12:57.291
We've only known each other
six months,

12:57.375 --> 12:59.417
but I've loved you every minute of it.

13:02.500 --> 13:06.000
- But if you don't share my feelings...
- No, no.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.542
I do.

13:08.625 --> 13:11.083
It's just that I can't help
being cautious.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.917
Since Rex,
I haven't been exactly lucky in love.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.208
I used to feel the same way.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.417
When Alma left me, I was shattered.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.000
But I realise now
it was the luckiest day of my life,

13:22.083 --> 13:25.208
because it meant I was free
when I met you.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.792
Luck can change, Bree.
Let me change yours.

13:36.959 --> 13:38.208
Yes.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.625
Yes?

13:40.709 --> 13:43.750
Yes, I will marry you, Orson.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.500
<i>Ian Hainsworth had been miserable</i>

14:15.583 --> 14:19.041
<i>ever since a tragic</i>
<i>horseback riding accident</i>

14:19.125 --> 14:21.834
<i>had left his wife, Jane, in a coma.</i>

14:23.500 --> 14:25.500
<i>For the next three years,</i>

14:25.583 --> 14:28.542
<i>he shied away from all social contact</i>

14:28.625 --> 14:31.458
<i>because he wanted</i>
<i>to be alone with his grief.</i>

14:33.500 --> 14:38.291
<i>Then one day he met Susan Mayer,</i>

14:38.375 --> 14:40.583
<i>who, because of her own tragedy,</i>

14:40.667 --> 14:43.625
<i>was just as miserable as he was.</i>

14:47.417 --> 14:50.458
<i>And a friendship slowly blossomed,</i>

14:50.542 --> 14:52.625
<i>because, as everyone knows,</i>

14:52.709 --> 14:55.291
<i>misery loves company.</i>

14:55.375 --> 14:58.542
<i>And Ian was loving this company</i>

15:00.041 --> 15:03.333
<i>more and more every day.</i>

15:08.625 --> 15:11.083
...two, three.

15:11.166 --> 15:14.166
Itch, itch, itch, itch, itch.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.917
- Do the nurses know you do this?
- Oh, hey.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.667
- You weren't supposed to see that.
- Well, clearly.

15:19.750 --> 15:23.417
But you can buy my silence
if you'll have coffee with me.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.417
I would love to,
but I think I'm in a rush here.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.542
I'm supposed to meet my girlfriends
for lunch at 1:00. Is it 1:00 yet?

15:28.625 --> 15:29.917
Well, you tell me.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.667
I noticed you're always
rushing into the hall to check the time,

15:32.750 --> 15:34.959
so I bought you this.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.458
Wow.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.667
I can't accept this.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.792
- This is too extravagant.
- It's nothing.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.375
There's a guy on the sidewalk
had a bunch of them

15:45.458 --> 15:49.333
laid out on a blanket.
If you look closely, it says Folex.

15:50.959 --> 15:52.166
- Still, I...
- Please.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.166
It would make me so happy
if you took it.

15:56.709 --> 16:00.208
Well, in that case,
thank you for my cheap knockoff.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.333
Oh, my God, I'm late.

16:17.333 --> 16:18.917
- Hi, hi, hi, hi.
- Hi.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.583
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- No, that's fine.

16:22.667 --> 16:26.166
Wow, white gloves. What,
are we having luncheon in the 1880s?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.333
Well, it's a very elegant club.

16:28.417 --> 16:30.625
You know, Orson's been
a member here for years.

16:30.709 --> 16:33.417
It'll be even nicer
when they finish the construction.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.208
So you were very mysterious
on the phone.

16:35.291 --> 16:36.500
Why did you want to have lunch?

16:36.583 --> 16:39.041
Well, I wanted to invite you to a dinner

16:39.125 --> 16:41.208
that Orson and I
are having this Saturday.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.625
So, you asked us to a meal
to announce another meal?

16:44.709 --> 16:47.125
That's so Bree of you.

16:47.667 --> 16:50.041
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion.

16:50.125 --> 16:53.625
- Just a little get-together.
- What are you being so coy about?

16:53.709 --> 16:56.333
- I'm not being coy.
- She said, coyly.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.458
If you don't tell us, we're not coming.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.917
All right.

17:03.667 --> 17:07.291
I wanted to wait and make
a proper announcement, but...

17:09.125 --> 17:11.834
- Orson and I are engaged.
- Oh, my gosh.

17:11.917 --> 17:15.792
- Let me see.
- You move fast.

17:15.875 --> 17:18.667
I know it's quick,
but it just feels so right.

17:18.750 --> 17:25.041
Orson is just the most warm,
wonderful, generous man.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.959
Generous,
that means he's good in the sack.

17:28.041 --> 17:30.959
Actually, no, we haven't had sex yet.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.667
We're waiting until we get married.

17:40.542 --> 17:43.333
Oh, my God, you're serious?

17:43.417 --> 17:46.250
No sex at all? Not even...

17:46.333 --> 17:48.542
Whatever you're alluding to, no.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.792
But you're gonna get married.

17:50.875 --> 17:55.041
You wouldn't buy a car without at least
taking it for a little test drive.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.834
It's not like you've never slept
with a guy you weren't married to.

17:58.917 --> 18:02.208
True, I have, in the past,
given myself away too freely.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.917
How charming of you to bring that up
while I'm announcing my engagement.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
But I like to think
that I have learned from my mistakes.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.750
So, the dinner is at 8:00.

18:09.834 --> 18:14.208
And when we make the announcement,
please, everybody look surprised.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.500
Don't worry,
I'm just gonna replay the look I had

18:16.583 --> 18:19.542
when I found out
you hadn't banged him yet.

18:27.250 --> 18:30.792
- Hey, sexy mama.
- That's cute.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.375
So you invited Kayla
to Parker's birthday party, right?

18:33.458 --> 18:35.625
- Of course.
- And?

18:35.709 --> 18:38.125
- And?
- What did you tell Nora?

18:38.208 --> 18:43.250
I told her that we were picking up Kayla
for a quiet afternoon at home.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.458
- You lied?
- Yeah, you're damn straight, I lied.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.750
I will not have that lunatic ruining
one more family gathering.

18:48.834 --> 18:51.917
But Kayla's gonna, you know,
tell Nora that we had a party,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.500
and I'm just afraid
that Nora's gonna blow a gasket.

18:59.041 --> 19:00.875
- What?
- So, what are you saying?

19:00.959 --> 19:02.834
You're more afraid of Nora
than you are of me?

19:02.917 --> 19:06.750
Is that what you think I meant?
Because that is so not what I meant.

19:08.792 --> 19:12.041
- You scare the hell out of me, baby.
- Thank you.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.959
The coffee machine was broken,
so I got us a couple of smoothies.

19:20.041 --> 19:23.500
- They had strawberry and strawberry.
- Well, I hate strawberry.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.875
So, give me the strawberry.

19:30.834 --> 19:33.208
- Hi, Jane.
- Nothing against smoothies,

19:33.291 --> 19:36.500
but I wouldn't mind
having some real food sometime.

19:36.583 --> 19:40.458
- Maybe we could go to a restaurant.
- You mean like outside the hospital?

19:40.542 --> 19:42.250
Yeah, you know, like a date.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.291
A date?

19:44.917 --> 19:47.625
Yeah. There's a lovely little bistro
down the street.

19:47.709 --> 19:50.000
I'm so... I'm really sorry.

19:51.083 --> 19:54.959
Well, that sounds just...
That sounds great.

19:56.542 --> 19:59.166
- I mean, I hope that's okay.
- Yeah.

20:04.375 --> 20:09.417
So, I was thinking about how
that sounded just now, the date thing.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.000
I really sprang it on you out of nowhere.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.000
Yes, you did.

20:20.041 --> 20:21.792
Jane looked cold.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.959
Thanks.

20:26.208 --> 20:29.792
Look, we're both in difficult situations.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.917
I've been in mine
a lot longer than you have.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.875
So, if you're not ready, I understand.

20:34.959 --> 20:38.250
If you ever should be, let me know.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.000
All right.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.750
I am really hungry.

20:43.834 --> 20:48.291
Well, then, let's go to the blood bank
and swipe some sugar cookies.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.041
You might wanna give Jane
a sponge bath,

20:55.125 --> 20:57.625
'cause she had a little accident.

21:10.792 --> 21:13.083
- Hello?
- Hey, Lynette, it's me.

21:13.792 --> 21:15.583
Hey, Nora.

21:18.709 --> 21:20.750
Are you having a party?

21:20.959 --> 21:22.875
Quiet, quiet, quiet. No.

21:23.792 --> 21:25.291
<i>No, no, of course not.</i>

21:25.375 --> 21:30.166
In fact, we're just having
a quiet afternoon at home.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.041
<i>The kids are so bored.</i>

21:32.125 --> 21:34.917
Tom and I were thinking
of taking them out for ice cream.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.792
Well, would you tell Kayla
that Mommy called to check on her?

21:38.875 --> 21:41.041
I will, I will. And I'll see you tonight.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.125
Okay. Bye.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.250
- You think she bought it?
- No.

21:47.333 --> 21:50.458
I think she'll be over here
in 10 minutes.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.333
Okay, let's move, let's move.

21:52.417 --> 21:57.208
I've got 10 bucks here for the kid
who can carry the most stuff, okay?

21:58.333 --> 22:01.250
Hey, Gabby, it's Lynette.
Got a little emergency here.

22:01.333 --> 22:04.375
Is it okay if we use your backyard?

22:04.458 --> 22:07.000
Great, great.

22:07.083 --> 22:11.417
And we take complete responsibility
for whatever the pony does.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.959
Hope you get this message soon.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.959
My only concern
would be the neighbourhood.

22:20.041 --> 22:23.083
We really need a quiet place
for our retirement.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.875
Oh, are you kidding?

22:24.959 --> 22:28.083
There's no place in Fairview
that's more peaceful.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.208
Where the hell is the pony?

22:30.291 --> 22:33.667
Okay, guys.
Come on, come on, come on!

22:34.875 --> 22:36.917
Let me show you the media room.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Come on, go on in. And the balloons.

22:40.083 --> 22:42.458
Good, good. All right.

22:42.542 --> 22:45.166
Okay. That's it. Everybody's in.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.542
Where's the cake?

22:48.625 --> 22:50.875
- Oh, crap!
- Crap!

22:55.417 --> 22:57.166
Yoo-hoo!

22:57.250 --> 22:59.667
Anybody home?

23:04.667 --> 23:07.125
- Hello?
- Hey, Nora. Wow.

23:07.208 --> 23:10.166
We weren't expecting you until 7:00.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.291
- So where's Kayla?
- I thought I told you

23:12.375 --> 23:14.542
Tom took the kids to the movies.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.542
You said ice cream.

23:19.959 --> 23:21.583
After the movies.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.834
Movies then ice cream,
an American tradition.

23:25.208 --> 23:27.208
So, is something wrong?

23:31.792 --> 23:36.083
To be honest, I thought that
you were lying and having a party.

23:36.166 --> 23:39.625
- I guess I was wrong.
- Apology accepted.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.291
Want me to walk you to your car?

23:47.333 --> 23:49.417
Where did everybody go?

23:52.208 --> 23:56.166
Nora, look, I am sorry I lied,
but, you know, you gave me no choice.

23:56.250 --> 23:59.125
Lynette, I want my daughter.

23:59.208 --> 24:02.250
Where's the damn party?

24:02.333 --> 24:05.250
- No. I'm not telling.
- Where's the party?

24:19.333 --> 24:22.875
No, no, no. You want in,
you're gonna have to go through me.

24:22.959 --> 24:25.667
I want my kid, Lynette.

24:25.750 --> 24:29.333
Kayla! Kayla, come out here now!

24:29.417 --> 24:30.792
What is going on?

24:30.875 --> 24:34.458
Well, first, you have a party
and you don't invite me,

24:34.542 --> 24:38.250
and then you lie about it.
So now we're leaving.

24:38.333 --> 24:41.834
Well, wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, Kayla.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.041
I'm sorry.

24:45.125 --> 24:48.750
We're sorry. We shouldn't have done it.

24:48.834 --> 24:51.000
But, look,
Kayla is having such a good time.

24:51.083 --> 24:53.542
Why don't we all just come on in
and have some cake and we can just...

24:53.667 --> 24:58.625
Lynette. Lynette. We can just have fun.
Could you excuse me for one second?

24:58.792 --> 25:00.583
Lynette.

25:01.166 --> 25:05.959
Okay, okay, I know, but what else
could I do? I'm just thinking of Kayla.

25:06.041 --> 25:08.875
I know you are, Tom,
and I know you love her.

25:08.959 --> 25:12.000
Why else do you think I'm willing
to put up with all this for six months?

25:12.083 --> 25:14.041
Why do you think I'm willing to say
to my college roommates,

25:14.125 --> 25:16.500
"Yes, that's my husband's love child
and her mother

25:16.583 --> 25:20.041
"in our Christmas picture."
Because I am your wife.

25:20.875 --> 25:23.208
You always come first with me.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.208
Do I still come first with you?

25:36.375 --> 25:40.375
- I guess I'll see you later, Nora.
- Well, I'm taking Kayla.

25:40.458 --> 25:44.667
Well, that's a shame.
I've gotta go hoist a piñata.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.542
Mommy, they have a piñata.

25:57.709 --> 26:01.667
Fine. I'll be back at 7:00.

26:01.750 --> 26:05.875
But there had better be
a corner piece of cake waiting for me.

26:08.667 --> 26:12.125
Come on, Kayla. Go have some fun.
Go have some fun.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.959
- Thank you for that.
- Sure.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.542
- I'll be back in 20 minutes.
- Gonna go buy a piñata?

26:27.041 --> 26:28.333
Sure am.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.917
Xiao Mei?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.333
Come on out. I have your lunch.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.875
Xiao Mei, your favourite soap is on.

26:43.959 --> 26:47.083
There's a doctor fondling a patient
on the operating table.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.500
You're missing it.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.083
Xiao Mei?

26:54.417 --> 26:55.917
Xiao Mei?

27:10.166 --> 27:11.709
Hey, quick question.

27:11.792 --> 27:14.583
Have you, by any chance,
seen Xiao Mei?

27:16.125 --> 27:19.458
- I can't believe you lost our baby.
- I did not lose our baby.

27:19.542 --> 27:22.041
Stop saying that.
I know exactly where it is.

27:22.125 --> 27:23.959
Inside some crazy Chinese woman

27:24.041 --> 27:26.709
who also stole half a chicken
from my fridge.

27:33.959 --> 27:38.000
Hi. Hi. Li Wang, right?

27:38.083 --> 27:41.250
Remember me? Xiao Mei lives with me.
You came over and we had lunch.

27:41.333 --> 27:44.667
You've got some nerve
showing your face here. Get out.

27:44.750 --> 27:48.792
Whoa, what happened to that
famous Chinese hospitality?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.709
Xiao Mei called me. She said you
threatened to send her back to China

27:51.792 --> 27:54.458
to work as a slave in a rice paddy.

27:56.542 --> 27:59.166
I may have mentioned deportation,

27:59.250 --> 28:01.667
but I didn't think
she'd take it personally.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.625
- Are you crazy?
- It was banter.

28:04.709 --> 28:06.458
I mean,
has this country come to the point

28:06.542 --> 28:09.083
where you can't joke with the help?

28:09.208 --> 28:11.125
You treat Xiao Mei like dirt.

28:11.208 --> 28:14.208
She's just a poor innocent girl
trying to live the American dream,

28:14.291 --> 28:16.417
just like your ancestors.

28:16.834 --> 28:19.333
Don't give me that
<i>We Are The World </i>crap.

28:19.417 --> 28:22.166
That woman's uterus
is harbouring a stolen baby,

28:22.250 --> 28:24.542
so if you know where she is,
you better start talking,

28:24.625 --> 28:26.417
or else I'm gonna get
the health department down here

28:26.542 --> 28:30.625
and take a closer look at what
you're serving as moo shu pork.

28:35.667 --> 28:39.458
Boy, those people just don't have
a sense of humour, do they?

28:39.542 --> 28:42.625
I'm telling you, at this number,
it's not gonna last long.

28:42.709 --> 28:44.542
Well, we like the neighbourhood,
but we've heard

28:44.625 --> 28:47.291
that some odd things
have gone on with this house.

28:47.375 --> 28:51.417
Complete fabrication. Malicious lies
spread by jealous competitors.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.792
Now you've gotta check out
this storage.

28:53.875 --> 28:56.750
You're not gonna believe
what you can fit in here.

29:00.667 --> 29:03.667
And now the media room.

29:03.750 --> 29:07.041
Wow, we certainly devoured
that ice cream.

29:07.125 --> 29:10.000
- Can I get you anything else?
- You tell me.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.834
Orson.

29:16.709 --> 29:18.417
I thought we...

29:18.500 --> 29:19.792
Orson.

29:19.875 --> 29:21.834
I just assumed,
now that we're engaged...

29:21.917 --> 29:24.458
Does that change our core values?

29:24.542 --> 29:26.000
No.

29:26.333 --> 29:29.917
But when I saw you standing in front
of the freezer in a clingy silk dress,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.709
let's just say, well, it challenged them.

29:32.792 --> 29:36.291
Well, I thought we agreed we wanted
our wedding night to be perfect.

29:36.375 --> 29:41.041
Yes, but actors want opening night
to be perfect. That's why they rehearse.

29:41.125 --> 29:43.333
It'll be better this way.

29:44.834 --> 29:47.875
Now, can I get you
some more ice cream?

29:49.125 --> 29:51.166
Not in that dress.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.834
Hi.

30:14.959 --> 30:17.417
So, I need to ask you something.

30:18.667 --> 30:22.542
Ian, you know, from across the hall?

30:22.625 --> 30:24.625
You met him.

30:25.583 --> 30:30.000
Anyway, he sort of asked me out

30:31.583 --> 30:33.166
on a date.

30:34.667 --> 30:38.166
I know, you're thrown.
I was thrown, too.

30:38.875 --> 30:41.291
But he's really nice and

30:43.542 --> 30:46.792
I could sort of use someone to talk to,

30:49.375 --> 30:51.375
who also talks back.

30:57.750 --> 31:01.291
The thing is, I'm sort of lonely,

31:03.500 --> 31:06.834
and the past six months
have been really hard on me.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.417
So what I need is,

31:13.750 --> 31:17.834
I need to know if it's okay with you
if I go out with him.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.583
Because if it's not, I won't.

31:23.667 --> 31:26.458
In fact, I'd like nothing better
than for you to just wake up right now

31:26.542 --> 31:28.625
and tell me not to go out with him.

31:28.709 --> 31:31.208
Just wake up and tell me.

31:31.291 --> 31:33.250
Wake up. Please.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.959
All right.

31:46.166 --> 31:48.083
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.291
I love you.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.208
It is really just dinner.

32:16.333 --> 32:19.458
I'm just dropping off Carlos
and then I'll be by to pick her up.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.250
Okay. Thanks, Edie.

32:23.208 --> 32:27.625
Xiao Mei's fine. Crisis averted.
No harm, no foul.

32:27.709 --> 32:28.792
How can you say that?

32:28.875 --> 32:30.959
You endangered the life of
our baby today.

32:31.041 --> 32:33.250
Don't you dare give me that attitude.

32:33.333 --> 32:35.959
You have no idea what I've been
going through these past six months.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.208
Here we go.

32:37.291 --> 32:40.583
I have had to wait hand and foot
on your mistress.

32:40.667 --> 32:43.333
I mean, imagine if the day after
you found out about John Rowland,

32:43.417 --> 32:45.709
you had to make his lunch
and rub his feet.

32:45.792 --> 32:47.834
Yeah, well, John Rowland
wasn't carrying our kid.

32:47.917 --> 32:51.750
Forgive me for being concerned
about our surrogate.

32:51.834 --> 32:54.166
Xiao Mei is going to be fine.

32:54.250 --> 32:56.750
Once that baby comes,
her slate is wiped clean.

32:56.834 --> 33:00.542
She's gonna walk away,
go off and live her American dream.

33:00.625 --> 33:05.083
Me? I'm gonna be stuck,
a single mother raising a child alone,

33:05.166 --> 33:08.834
haggling with lawyers
on who gets the kid at Christmas.

33:10.750 --> 33:13.500
My American dream is officially dead.

33:16.875 --> 33:18.750
I'm sorry.

33:19.583 --> 33:20.959
Thank you.

33:22.166 --> 33:25.375
Look, just so you know,
my dream isn't exactly...

33:31.875 --> 33:34.417
Okay, so we will see you Saturday.

33:34.500 --> 33:38.375
And please pretend to be surprised.
Bye.

33:39.709 --> 33:41.542
You told someone else?

33:41.625 --> 33:43.333
Bree, I thought the whole point
of the party

33:43.417 --> 33:45.166
was to announce our engagement.

33:45.250 --> 33:48.875
I just can't help it. I like
telling people.

33:48.959 --> 33:53.875
It makes me feel... I don't know.
It makes me feel like I'm starting over.

33:53.959 --> 33:56.709
- It feels good.
- Feels good to me, too, though.

33:59.250 --> 34:01.291
No hands, see?

34:06.667 --> 34:09.417
You don't have to wash those.
I already did them.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.083
Oh, I found some streaks.

34:12.166 --> 34:15.917
So I'm wiping them down
with undiluted red wine vinegar.

34:16.667 --> 34:18.667
I've never heard of that.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.208
Sure. But for tougher spots,

34:21.291 --> 34:25.375
I use a 50-50 mix
of denatured alcohol and water.

34:27.875 --> 34:30.291
And for those really intractable stains,

34:30.375 --> 34:33.792
I mean, we're talking shower doors,

34:33.875 --> 34:36.834
I wipe on lacquer thinner with a towel.

34:42.792 --> 34:44.000
Bree?

34:54.542 --> 34:55.959
Oh, Orson.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.291
Excuse me.

35:13.375 --> 35:15.834
Did you lose something?

35:15.917 --> 35:19.000
No, I just thought... For you...

35:22.250 --> 35:25.500
- I don't do that.
- Why not?

35:25.583 --> 35:28.375
- I'm a Republican.
- I'm a Libertarian.

35:28.458 --> 35:32.750
I believe in minimising the role of the
state and maximising individual rights.

35:32.834 --> 35:35.417
But, Orson...

35:35.500 --> 35:38.000
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

35:39.333 --> 35:40.667
Okay.

35:56.375 --> 35:58.375
- Oh, no.
- What?

35:58.458 --> 36:00.917
You didn't just crack
that veneer again, did you?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.041
I have to go.

36:03.125 --> 36:06.333
Go? Go where?

36:07.417 --> 36:10.166
And then it was like
something inside ruptured.

36:10.250 --> 36:13.208
Well, not so much a rupture
as a spasm.

36:13.291 --> 36:16.291
Waves of this hot, clutching...

36:16.375 --> 36:19.375
I think I might have had a small stroke.

36:19.458 --> 36:22.208
- How severe were the pains?
- Well, that's the odd thing.

36:22.291 --> 36:27.000
I mean, there was no pain, per se.
In fact, it wasn't entirely unpleasant.

36:27.875 --> 36:30.375
What were you doing at the time?

36:31.583 --> 36:36.750
I was with my fiancé.
We were lying down, resting.

36:37.709 --> 36:41.333
I'm gonna take a wild swing here.
Were you having sex?

36:42.834 --> 36:44.333
Sort of.

36:44.417 --> 36:48.917
Miss Van De Kamp,
I think you may have had an orgasm.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.792
- No, no, no. I've had orgasms before.
- How would you describe them?

36:52.875 --> 36:57.709
You know, that warm sensation, that
tingling feeling of relief when it's over.

36:57.792 --> 36:59.750
No, no. This was much...

36:59.834 --> 37:02.125
- Better?
- Yes.

37:02.208 --> 37:05.041
That's 'cause it was an orgasm.

37:10.083 --> 37:12.500
Well, I'll be darned.

37:30.792 --> 37:33.291
- Let me have one of those.
- Here you go.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.583
It's beautiful.

37:49.208 --> 37:51.000
Hi. Can I help you?

37:51.667 --> 37:54.792
- Are you Bree Van De Kamp?
- Yes. And you are?

37:54.875 --> 37:58.333
Carolyn Bigsby.
I was Orson's neighbour.

37:58.667 --> 38:02.333
Well, come on in.
Let's dry you off and get you a drink.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.667
I didn't come here to celebrate.

38:08.291 --> 38:09.792
Carolyn.

38:09.875 --> 38:12.542
Engaged again? That was quick work.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.000
Does she know you killed your wife?

38:19.542 --> 38:21.542
My wife left me.

38:23.041 --> 38:27.041
And no one ever heard from her again.
Not me, not her family.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.417
Just dropped off the face of the Earth.

38:34.333 --> 38:38.000
- Orson, what is she talking about?
- Didn't tell you that part, did he?

38:38.083 --> 38:40.000
All right, Carolyn.
You've made your little scene.

38:40.083 --> 38:42.291
You keep your hands off me.

38:43.417 --> 38:47.417
Don't let him fool you.
Get away from him now while you can.

38:51.208 --> 38:54.875
- Please leave my house.
- Fine.

38:54.959 --> 38:57.667
Be a fool. Marry him.

38:57.750 --> 39:01.083
Just don't be surprised
when you go missing, too.

39:19.875 --> 39:22.375
I'm sorry you had to endure that.

39:26.959 --> 39:30.625
Your wife disappeared?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.125
I tried to find her.

39:34.792 --> 39:38.166
Her family claimed
not to have heard from her.

39:38.792 --> 39:42.333
Personally, I think
she was just trying to punish me.

39:43.208 --> 39:46.500
So, are you still married?

39:46.834 --> 39:50.500
No. I was granted a divorce
on grounds of abandonment.

39:53.917 --> 39:55.208
Bree.

39:56.834 --> 40:00.333
- You can't possibly think that...
- No, of course not.

40:04.625 --> 40:06.083
I love you.

40:07.291 --> 40:08.959
And I love you.

40:13.125 --> 40:16.166
Orson, my hand.

40:43.959 --> 40:45.750
The buffet is open.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.500
Bree?

40:57.375 --> 41:00.250
It's gorgeous, just gorgeous.

41:15.333 --> 41:18.375
<i>Every storm brings with it hope</i>

41:18.542 --> 41:20.792
<i>that somehow, by morning,</i>

41:20.875 --> 41:24.083
<i>everything will be made clean again</i>

41:24.166 --> 41:28.166
<i>and even the most troubling stains</i>
<i>will have disappeared.</i>

41:28.917 --> 41:31.709
<i>Like the doubts over his innocence.</i>

41:35.125 --> 41:38.500
<i>Or the consequence of his mistake.</i>

41:43.041 --> 41:46.291
<i>Like the scars of his betrayal.</i>

41:52.041 --> 41:55.166
<i>Or the memory of his kiss.</i>

41:59.166 --> 42:04.041
<i>So we wait for the storm to pass,</i>
<i>hoping for the best,</i>

42:09.458 --> 42:13.500
<i>even though we know in our hearts</i>

42:14.542 --> 42:18.959
<i>some stains are so indelible,</i>

42:19.041 --> 42:21.792
<i>nothing can wash them away.</i>
