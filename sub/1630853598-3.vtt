[narrator] It's New Jersey, 1953,

00:28.361 --> 00:31.197
and Elmer Tatelman hates his grandfather.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.284
Elmer blames everything
on his grandfather.

00:34.784 --> 00:37.495
His mother's pain, his father's death,

00:37.579 --> 00:39.664

Elmer is about to invent…

00:55.263 --> 00:58.141
[electricity crackling]

00:58.224 --> 00:59.392
…time travel.

01:01.269 --> 01:04.647
You see, Elmer has decided
the key to his future happiness

01:04.731 --> 01:06.149
is to go back in time

01:07.025 --> 01:09.152
and kill his grandfather.

01:28.671 --> 01:32.133
[narrator] You see,
murdering his grandfather in 1905

01:32.217 --> 01:36.554

didn't exist to meet his father in 1925.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.889
[buzzer sounds]

01:39.974 --> 01:44.437

that Elmer himself was never born.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.480
[buzzer sounds]

01:45.563 --> 01:49.109
[narrator] Elmer killed his grandfather,
so his mother was never born.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.695
But if his mother was never born,
Elmer no longer exists.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.489
But if Elmer no longer exists,

01:54.572 --> 01:57.075
how could he possibly kill
his grandfather?

01:57.867 --> 02:00.286
And around and around we go.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.039

-[Lila] Hmm?

11:12.838 --> 11:14.548
You need to take this kid with you.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.093
-The hell were you doing in there?
-Bathing.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.594
-Together?
-Oh, okay.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.139
Diego, we don't have time for this.
Lila and I have got important shit to do.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.809
-Wait. What's more important than family?
-Hey, love.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.394
End of the world, genius.

11:27.937 --> 11:28.771
[Diego] Lila?

11:30.356 --> 11:31.857
What's more important than us?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.526
-There is no us, Diego.
-[bell dings]

11:33.609 --> 11:34.985
[elevator door opens]

11:36.195 --> 11:37.196
[Diego] Come here.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.243
-What do you mean?
-Look, for you, it's been a couple days.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.705
For me, it has been over a decade.
I've moved on.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.916
I've slept with many, many people. Many.

11:50.668 --> 11:54.797
The only relationship we have left
is the one with our child.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.925
So you better not screw that up.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.386
Wait! What am I supposed to do
with him, huh?

12:00.886 --> 12:02.513
I got important shit going on too!

12:02.596 --> 12:03.639
I doubt that.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.851
Figure it out, Diego. Be a dad.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.063
[elevator whirs]

12:12.022 --> 12:13.691
How many is "many people"?

12:13.774 --> 12:16.068
Way more than you, Papi.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.778
-[Stan gasps]
-[Diego snarls]

12:20.030 --> 12:23.325
So, all the people on the street
just disappeared?

12:23.409 --> 12:26.078
Well, no, not all of them,
just… half of them.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.038
Five did say animals were disappearing.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.207
Okay, well, now it's definitely people.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.502
Marcus was supposed to meet up
with us earlier, but he never showed.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.880
What, you think this grandfather thing
ate Marcus?

12:35.963 --> 12:39.341
-It can't just be a coincidence, right?
-[sighs] Great.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.344
Now those Sparrow psychopaths
think we took their Number One.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.971
We're never getting the briefcase back.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.099
Okay, what if…

12:48.809 --> 12:50.686
What if we just told the truth?

12:51.395 --> 12:55.024
Marcus is gone,
and maybe we're partially responsible.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.859
That'll go well.
They'll throw us a party.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.736
I bet they throw fantastic parties.

12:58.819 --> 13:02.281
Listen. Marcus was ready
to give us back the briefcase.

13:02.364 --> 13:05.451
If the rest of his family
are even half as open-minded, you know,

13:05.534 --> 13:08.621
maybe we can come to some kind of
an agreement, get it back.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.997
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.417
Well, if you guys are heading over there,
I should probably come along.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.336
You know, uh, for protection.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.257
Yeah.

13:21.926 --> 13:22.843
Nice try, Stockholm.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.387
Your ass is staying here.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.430
Wha--?

13:27.473 --> 13:28.599
-She's right.
-[Luther] What?

13:28.682 --> 13:30.851
Who put you two in charge?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.186
[quietly] Look, Allison…

13:33.437 --> 13:35.523
She needs something
to take her mind off Claire.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.274
So, we'll handle this.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.276
Yeah. Copy.

13:39.819 --> 13:40.945
Hey, um…

13:41.612 --> 13:43.197
Thanks for looking out for her.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.289
[ravens cawing]

13:56.794 --> 14:00.172
[chopping]

14:04.301 --> 14:07.763
We're getting tons of missing person
complaints in a three-block radius.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.182
-I was thinking hysteria.
-What are they up to?

14:10.266 --> 14:11.141
Who?

14:11.767 --> 14:13.269
The Umbrella Academy.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.354
Use your head, Number Two.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.775
First Marcus, now they're
grabbing civilians off the streets?

14:19.859 --> 14:20.860
"Number Two"?

14:21.944 --> 14:23.737
I suppose that means
you're Number One now?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.447
Marcus is missing.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.700
I'm taking the reins.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.159
[chuckles]

14:29.243 --> 14:30.494
[wings fluttering]

14:30.578 --> 14:33.080
What? You think it should be you?

14:35.457 --> 14:37.042
You had your chance once.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.170
Didn't turn out too well, now, did it?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.590
[Ben exhales sharply]

14:44.425 --> 14:45.885
[raven shrieks]

14:48.721 --> 14:49.889
Say that again.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.349
[wincing]

14:52.975 --> 14:54.602
[telekinetic whoosh]

14:54.685 --> 14:57.104
[ravens cawing]

15:02.359 --> 15:05.195
Excuse me.
Children, do you mind if I clean up?

15:05.279 --> 15:06.196
Do it quickly.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.451
[ravens cawing]

15:11.660 --> 15:13.787
-You know I respect Marcus.
-Of course.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.331
-I'd do anything to protect him.
-Sure.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.542
But we've been Numbers Two and Three
for far too long, Fei.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.919
With Marcus gone,

15:20.961 --> 15:22.004
it's moving day.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.006
[exhales]

15:24.089 --> 15:25.341
Change can be good.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.383
[Ben] Think about it.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.261
You, me, center stage.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.138
Taking things to the next level.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.892
So how do we handle
the Umbrella situation?

15:34.975 --> 15:38.145
If they bring Marcus back, so be it.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.316
If they don't,

15:43.859 --> 15:45.986
then we have some decisions to make.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.073
Marcus isn't coming back. God took him.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.240
God?

15:52.534 --> 15:55.120
Yes, God is in the basement,

15:55.621 --> 15:57.164
and he called Marcus home.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.213
-Does she need a checkup?
-Focus, Fei.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.798
We play this right,

16:06.382 --> 16:09.593
Sparrow Academy is all ours.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.060
[sighs]

16:21.605 --> 16:23.065
[bell dings]

16:27.945 --> 16:29.154
Chet, hold my calls.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.698
-[Chet] No.
-Good man.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.159
[bell ringing]

16:34.743 --> 16:35.953
Can I get a room?

16:37.371 --> 16:38.998
[Chet] Yes, sir, right with you.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.292
[newscaster] We interrupt
today's regularly scheduled program

16:42.376 --> 16:44.378
to bring you this late-breaking story.

16:44.461 --> 16:45.796
Authorities are baffled

16:45.879 --> 16:48.382
as hundreds of people
across the city have vanished,

16:48.465 --> 16:50.467
seemingly without a trace…

16:50.551 --> 16:52.803
Another silly conspiracy theory.

16:52.886 --> 16:57.599
…have increased by a staggering 500%
in recent days.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.353
However, with no bodies found,
no suspects, and no explanation,

17:01.437 --> 17:03.731
police have been scrambling to…

17:03.814 --> 17:05.899
[ominous music swelling]

17:07.192 --> 17:10.112
[ravens cawing]

17:18.078 --> 17:19.038
You're one short.

17:20.414 --> 17:24.126
-Where's the rest of your pathetic family?
-Aww. Is that the best you can do?

17:24.209 --> 17:25.377
Last warning.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.338
Yeah, you don't get to warn me about shit,
Flock of She-Gulls.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.049
[laughs]

17:31.341 --> 17:32.217
[Ben clears throat]

17:32.801 --> 17:33.761
[Ben] Whatever.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.930
Where the fuck is Marcus?

17:37.014 --> 17:38.474
Marcus is, uh…

17:39.058 --> 17:40.350
[Viktor] Marcus, uh…

17:40.434 --> 17:41.393
Marcus is--

17:41.477 --> 17:42.644
Safe.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.397
For now.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.317
But that'll change real quick
if you don't do exactly as we say.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.278
See? I told you they have him.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.739
I warned Marcus, but no.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.241
He said we had
to hear what you had to say.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.495
Look, he wasn't wrong, okay?
We want to make things right with you--

17:59.578 --> 18:00.996
By kidnapping our brother?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.164
-No, that's--
-Yes.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.170
Look, there is a lot more going on here.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.880
The world is in trouble,

18:10.547 --> 18:12.424
and we need to work together.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.719
My brother could explain it all
a lot better than me,

18:15.803 --> 18:18.806
but… it's a time-traveling problem.

18:19.515 --> 18:23.393
We caused a paradox,
and that paradox is swallowing things.

18:24.019 --> 18:27.439
Lots of cows, and a dog,

18:27.523 --> 18:28.941
a few lobsters,

18:29.691 --> 18:31.777
but also people.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.445
Look, I know it sounds like--

18:33.529 --> 18:36.448
Just give us the briefcase,
and we'll give you Marcus.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.366
What briefcase?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.243
The one we left in your house.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.286
Deal.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.872
The briefcase for our brother.

18:45.165 --> 18:45.999
Great.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.087
Hotel Obsidian, four o'clock sharp.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.923
[Allison] Or we'll send him back
in pieces.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.222
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

19:06.687 --> 19:08.355
[steam hissing]

19:08.438 --> 19:09.773
Oh… Woof!

19:10.649 --> 19:12.401
Ooh, that takes me back.

19:14.945 --> 19:15.863
All right.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.802
Whoa, what the hell was that?

19:38.886 --> 19:41.305
What? You were losing them.
I'm an actor, I improvised.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.141
Superb performance, Helen Mirren,
but we don't have Marcus.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.350
Well, they don't know that.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.769
What are we gonna do
when they show up and find out?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.606
I don't know. We'll figure that out next.
But why don't you relax?

19:50.689 --> 19:53.150
We're powerful superheroes.
It's time we started acting like it.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.694
Oh, like how you almost
turned a conversation with Ben

19:55.777 --> 19:57.237
into a street fight?

19:57.321 --> 19:59.323
-Come on, it's not like you.
-What does that mean?

19:59.990 --> 20:03.994
Since when do you have a hair trigger?
You're usually the calm and cool one.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.455
Yeah, and look how well
that worked out for me.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.875
Viktor, we could go home tonight, okay?

20:09.958 --> 20:13.378
And for the first time in days,
I feel hope, so please don't step on that.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.716
[sighs] Okay, but come on,
we have to be smarter about this.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.635
We don't know enough about the Sparrows.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.512
I don't give a shit about them.
I've got you.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.307
No one's gonna win a fight
against me and my tiny badass brother.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.812
[sighs] Okay.
Well, I need the briefcase too.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.774
It's my only way back to Sissy.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.776
But no more improvising, okay?

20:35.859 --> 20:36.902
[sighs]

20:36.985 --> 20:39.571
We do things together from now on, got it?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.033
Got it.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.748
[car horns honking]

20:57.965 --> 21:00.342
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

21:00.842 --> 21:04.513
Security assessment.
Our enemies can attack us from anywhere.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.223
[chuckles] That's cool.

21:06.723 --> 21:07.975
No, that is not cool.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.810
But lucky for everyone, I'm on it.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.436
The trick is to be prepared.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.731
Now, I need you to stay away from
the hotel for a few hours, all right?

21:14.815 --> 21:17.234
It's not safe. Go buy some donuts.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.694
I'm allergic to donuts.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.280
What do you mean,
you're allergic to donuts?

21:21.363 --> 21:22.364
You also hate fun?

21:22.447 --> 21:24.616
-It's the gluten, asshat.
-Hey, watch your mouth.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.494
Stop trying to get rid of me.
Everyone tries to do that.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.079
Maybe just try being less annoying.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.373
[laughs] Oh my God. You're bad at this.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.334
Just go somewhere
for a few hours, all right?

21:34.418 --> 21:35.919
It's a big city. Have fun.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.131
Mom would never let me
walk around a strange city all on my own.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.090
She doesn't trust me.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.259
That's because she's a terrible person.

21:42.759 --> 21:43.927
And I'm amazing.

21:44.011 --> 21:44.970
Remember that.

21:45.929 --> 21:46.888
It's eight dollars.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.891
That's a month's salary for a kid.
Get outta here.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.273
I'm so good at this.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.695
[Klaus straining]

22:04.281 --> 22:05.449
[grunts]

22:08.285 --> 22:09.244
[groans]

22:10.704 --> 22:11.788
[grunts]

22:18.128 --> 22:19.046
[sneezes]

22:19.546 --> 22:21.798
[groans]

22:24.468 --> 22:25.927
Oh, thank God.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.184
[sniffs]

22:34.061 --> 22:35.312
[gasps] Have at you!

22:35.395 --> 22:37.898
[police sirens wailing on television]

22:42.486 --> 22:44.112
-Did you do it?
-How did you get in here?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.281
Did you kill our moms?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.659
Moms? What in the world
are you talking about?

22:50.577 --> 22:51.661
Please just…

22:53.205 --> 22:57.000
Please just tell me whether or not
you killed them, and then I'll leave.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.126
I promise.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.755
I don't care enough about you to lie.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.633
Do I look fit to murder anyone?

23:06.218 --> 23:09.846
Well, maybe not now, but…

23:09.930 --> 23:11.390
On your feet, boy.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.936
-You're the drunk one, aren't you?

that they "forgot" something here?

What if we open it and it explodes?

[Grace] Jesus is one
possible interpretation of this deity.

25:37.577 --> 25:40.914
Or perhaps it's the reincarnation
of Buddha or Brahma the Creator.

Yeah, yeah, whatever.

Well, I'm glad my pain amuses you.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.425
You have no idea. It's like my therapy.

27:15.508 --> 27:18.762
Well, now we are down
to one half-dead briefcase,

27:18.845 --> 27:21.348
and my jumps are only accurate
up to a couple minutes.

27:21.431 --> 27:24.059
So, essentially, we're screwed.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.143
Maybe.

Maybe not.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.075
I think we could create
some kind of feedback loop

27:40.158 --> 27:42.160
and get enough juice
to jump-start the case.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.829
-Both of us together.
-We'd have to trust each other.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.082
[scoffs] Lila, you just spent
the better part

27:47.165 --> 27:48.833
of the last ten days
trying to end my life.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.461
-You killed my birth parents.
-Fair enough.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.799
And your entire family stood by

27:55.882 --> 27:58.760
while that greasy Swede
put a cap in the woman who raised me.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.596
The Handler was going to kill you, Lila.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.932
In fact, she did kill you.

28:04.015 --> 28:08.186
Then I rolled back time
and let the meatball do his work.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.438
Oh, and by the way,

28:10.522 --> 28:13.525
if you're leading Diego on
as payback for what happened in Texas,

28:13.608 --> 28:15.568
you're pissing up the wrong ladder there

'cause that idiot may actually love you.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.073
The Handler never did.

28:22.659 --> 28:25.537
What do you know?
You spent decades shagging a mannequin.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.997
Do not talk about Delores like that, Lila.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.207
This is insane.

28:29.290 --> 28:32.001
There is no way we're gonna get past this
to make it to the Commission.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.671
Okay, perhaps we can't get to trust,

28:34.754 --> 28:37.757
but there is a certain honesty
in white-hot hatred.
