00:11.762 --> 00:14.348
- Even Instagram knows
I'm going through a breakup.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.975
I just got an ad
for "singles grave plots."

00:16.975 --> 00:19.853
- You're not gonna die alone
because I'm gonna cremate you

00:19.853 --> 00:22.481
and put you in my smoothie,
so I can drink you every morning.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.858
- Honestly, can we just skip
ahead to the cremation part?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.152
Anything to not feel
what I'm feeling right now.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.530
Maggie, I know it sucks.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.573
Thought I could be myself with Daniel.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.700
It's embarrassing when you
show yourself to someone,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.119
and then that's why the relationship ends.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.287
Give me his address.

00:37.287 --> 00:41.708
Thelma's got IBS, and I have
a stack of paper bags and a lighter.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.293
- Thank you.
Hey, Maggie,

00:43.293 --> 00:45.796
any chance you'd want to go
to prom with me tomorrow night?

00:45.796 --> 00:48.924
- Uh, I don't know.
I'll have to ask my parents,

00:48.924 --> 00:51.260
and they'll be just as confused as I am.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.679
- Oh, no, no, no. I want you
to come as the entertainment,

00:53.679 --> 00:54.972
um, as a psychic.

00:54.972 --> 00:57.432
You know, the guy who writes
names on rice dropped out.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.184
He's at the hospital with carpal tunnel.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.602
- Oh.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.814
- I think one prom in a lifetime
is enough for me.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.024
- Ah, man, I'd love
to go to prom as an adult.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.110
I'd finally get to ask all
the teens if it's good or bad

01:08.110 --> 01:09.653
when people call me "cheugy."

01:09.653 --> 01:10.904
You wanna come too, Lou?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.740
Amy, Dave, and Jessie all said no,
and you'd really be saving me.

01:13.740 --> 01:17.411
I can always use another set of eyes
to police for vapes and wine bras.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.954
Do I look like a narc to you?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.415
Because I would love to!

01:21.415 --> 01:23.166
- Oh, great.
- Come on, let's go!

01:23.166 --> 01:24.751
It'll get your mind off Daniel.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.752
Plus, if you don't come,

01:25.752 --> 01:27.838
then I'll have to learn
how to write on rice,

01:27.838 --> 01:30.883
and one of my students' names
is "Redlingshafer."

01:30.883 --> 01:31.925
It can't be done.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.471
Uh... okay, fine.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.599
- I will come.
- Yes! Oh!

01:38.599 --> 01:41.518
- No, but I will not be
cranking that Soulja Boy. No.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.024
- How great is it that we get
to do this all over again?

01:47.024 --> 01:50.360
- Wait, a-are we overdressed?
That girl's wearing a sweatsuit.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.404
- Who cares? I'm rockin'
the same nipple petals

01:52.404 --> 01:55.490
- from prom '07, baby.
- They still have stick?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.617
Nope, not at all.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.036
Um... Oh, yeah, they fell off in the Uber.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.955
- Tonight has to be better
than our prom, right?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.124
- What are you talking about?
Our prom ruled.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.836
- I think you're thinking of not us
and not what happened.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.179
Guys, guys, guys!

02:17.179 --> 02:19.556
Prom King and Queen
are gonna be Joe and Ilana!

02:19.556 --> 02:21.892
- Seriously? Come on.
Why did you have to do that?

02:21.892 --> 02:22.893
- Spoilers!
- You suck.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.229
Brandy, wait.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.069
Hey, Rachel, Rachel.
Be careful at the after-party.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.737
The police are gonna bust it.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.697
Are you gonna call the cops on us?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.324
That's messed up.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.409
- No--

02:44.081 --> 02:45.707
Hey, you wanna dance or something?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.709
- Can't. Chem test Tuesday.
Parents are on my ass.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.671
Uh, quick... Ask me what
the atomic weight of zirconium is.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.506
- What's the atomic--
- Ninety-one!

02:53.173 --> 02:55.008
Ah, I got it right!

02:55.759 --> 02:57.970
Well, at least we're
in a way better place now.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.638
Kids are gonna look at us
and be like,

02:59.638 --> 03:02.808
"Oh my gosh, they're so cool,
and, like, totally goals."

03:02.808 --> 03:05.894
- We are goals.
I know how to do my eyeliner now.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.313
- Yeah, and I don't have to wear
prescription deodorant anymore.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.524
Hell, yeah! Let's go to prom.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.629
♪

03:32.629 --> 03:33.630
BEN:
Hey!

03:34.256 --> 03:36.175
You guys clean up so nice.

03:36.175 --> 03:39.428
- Hm, you too. Lookin' spicy.
- Thank you.

03:39.428 --> 03:42.014
This is my "history teacher
after dark" look.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.308
- Um...
- You know what?

03:44.308 --> 03:46.101
That does not sound right.
I will not call it that.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.103
So, you ready to narc, Louise?

03:48.103 --> 03:49.813
- Uh-huh. Oh.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.608
Spotted. Blunt in the boutonnière,
flask strapped to the thigh,

03:52.608 --> 03:54.818
and those cufflinks are actually molly.

03:55.611 --> 03:58.238
Time for me to do my thing.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.074
- Wow, she's like RoboCop.
- Yep.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.744
So, um, how are ya since the breakup?

04:03.744 --> 04:06.580
- Oh, no, no, no.
We are not talking about that.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.916
I am just here to tell
a bunch of horned-up teens

04:08.916 --> 04:11.084
which Ivy Leagues
they are not getting into.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.922
- Gotcha. I'm gonna hit the dance floor.
I'm on "grind control."

04:15.589 --> 04:18.425
- Ooh, yeah, those two look like
they're trying to start a campfire.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.428
- Hey, guys... don't make me
get the spray bottle.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.646
- You don't wanna be doin' that anyway.
Lot of chafing.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.941
- What if I wanna chafe?
At least then I'd feel something.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.860
Nobody wants to dance
with "That's So Not Raven."

04:36.860 --> 04:38.320
Well, as your guidance counselor,

04:38.320 --> 04:40.781
I'm proud of you for being
so open about your gift.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.616
You are unapologetically you.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.078
I guess. What about you, Mr. Hart?

04:46.078 --> 04:48.372
When are you gonna show
people who you really are?

04:48.372 --> 04:50.165
Everybody knows I'm a proud gay man.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.334
I drive a Kia Soul
with a bumper sticker that says,

04:52.334 --> 04:53.836
"My other car is a fireman."

04:55.921 --> 05:00.300
- No, I mean... the fact that nobody
but me knows that you're a psychic, too.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.054
- Maggie, no, I am a grown-up
with a two-bedroom apartment,

05:04.054 --> 05:07.057
and a Yankee Candle addiction.
I have expenses.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.643
This school does not want
a psychic on their payroll.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.646
- Okay, well, when I'm grown up,
you'll never catch me in a high school.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.440
So, how's high school going?

05:15.440 --> 05:18.694
- Well, I've been hooking up with this guy
from my wrestling team all year,

05:18.694 --> 05:22.281
and I need to know if he'll ever
commit to a real relationship.

05:22.281 --> 05:26.910
- Oh, well, in my experience,
men will always disappoint you,

05:26.910 --> 05:29.496
so... brace yourself.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.417
Will you be my boyfriend?

05:35.919 --> 05:36.753
Yes.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.132
Ha!

05:41.466 --> 05:44.970
Looks like you got one of the good ones.
Hold on to him.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.307
- I'm sorry about smashing
your inhaler earlier.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.267
I really thought it was a vape pen.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.729
But, uh, you, Missy, I will have
to confiscate that nip of vodka.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.398
I know, it sucks, but soon enough,

05:56.398 --> 05:59.693
you guys'll be old enough
to bring vodka wherever you want.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.446
Like, the movie theater,
or, you know, the DMV,

06:02.446 --> 06:04.948
so it's all Gucci, right?

06:04.948 --> 06:08.619
- What class did you say you teach again?
I-I, I don't think I've seen you here.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.828
I'm not a teacher.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.039
- So, you're just, like,
a professional prom narc?

06:12.497 --> 06:16.001
No... I'm here helping out Mr. Morales.

06:16.001 --> 06:20.589
Yeah, and not to brag,
but... I'm actually a yoga instructor.

06:20.589 --> 06:24.134
- As, like, your job?
- I think she means as a hobby.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.386
No, Sparkles. It is my job.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.890
- So, did you, like...
invent goat yoga or something?

06:29.890 --> 06:33.477
- What?! No! But a goat did
eat my hair extensions once.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.648
Y-You know what?
I didn't come here to defend myself, okay?

06:37.648 --> 06:40.776
- So, I want to be
a professional soccer player,

06:40.776 --> 06:43.654
but I'm worried my boyfriend
will think it's dumb,

06:43.654 --> 06:46.156
and I just want him to believe in me.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.408
Ugh, girl, I feel you.

06:48.408 --> 06:52.371
But if he doesn't support you,
it's better to find out now

06:52.371 --> 06:56.208
before you clog your phone up
with photos of him and his stupid beard

06:56.208 --> 06:57.960
that makes you cry.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.920
- What?
- Never mind.

07:02.881 --> 07:03.882
Ha!

07:04.967 --> 07:07.386
Not only does he believe in you,

07:07.386 --> 07:11.557
when you go pro, he gets
your jersey number tattooed on his back.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.226
Actual size.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.482
Man, these kids
are really throwing me off.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.526
What a bunch
of well-adjusted little weirdos.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.152
Tell me about it.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.320
I'm an excellent narc,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.948
but for some reason,
no one thinks I'm cool.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.242
Actually, saying that out loud,
I should've seen that coming.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.662
- Look... They're all in healthy,
supportive relationships.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.582
I'm starting to think there's
something wrong with me.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.376
Barkeep, you got anything stronger?

07:39.376 --> 07:43.380
- I'm a gym teacher,
and, um, refreshments aren't for parents.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.510
Wow... really twisting the knife.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.138
I can't believe that just happened.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.473
♪

07:55.475 --> 07:57.227
♪

07:57.227 --> 07:59.813
Sorry, you won't be having sex tonight.

08:00.689 --> 08:04.109
But if it makes you feel any better,
neither will I?

08:04.902 --> 08:08.197
- Well, I-I see a solution
to both our problems.

08:08.197 --> 08:12.367
Honors Bio taught me it's called
a "symbiotic relationship."

08:13.952 --> 08:15.787
I'm also taking Anatomy.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.626
- Go get some punch, Kenneth.
- Okay, sorry.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.467
Now, don't feel bad, Kurt, okay?

08:28.467 --> 08:31.887
The first time I tried to tie a tie,
I passed out.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.348
All right... you look so sharp.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.058
Now, go ask Alec to dance.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.268
Go! Yes! Go!

08:41.522 --> 08:45.567
- H3
- C, CH2, CH3 is propane.

08:45.567 --> 08:49.488
- Holy crap, he's hot.
Do you think his hair is naturally black?

08:49.488 --> 08:52.783
- Uh, well, his eyebrows are red
and he's got freckles.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.786
- Oh no, he saw us.
Pretend like we're dancing.

08:55.786 --> 08:56.620
Okay.

08:57.496 --> 09:02.251
- Actually, he's kinda scary.
- - H3
- C, CH2, CH3 is propane.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.877
Maggie? Oh.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.631
Trevor got into Penn.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.342
Why would you tell him
to commit to art school?

09:10.342 --> 09:12.845
You might as well tell him
to grow a handlebar mustache now

09:12.845 --> 09:14.805
because he's goin'
straight to being a barista.

09:14.805 --> 09:15.806
He's an artist.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.724
That's what he's going
to do with his life.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.976
You don't know that, Victor.

09:18.976 --> 09:22.479
- I think I do, and it is my job
to guide these students.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.983
- Well, lately, you've been guiding
angry parents into my office.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.652
Now talk to Trevor and fix this.

09:34.700 --> 09:38.120
- I love that one.
Oh my god, you look so cute.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.872
Look at that.

09:39.872 --> 09:43.500
- Uh, so, just to be clear--
- Oh, that lady's back.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.711
That's right. The lady is back.

09:45.711 --> 09:50.799
Yoga might be a part-time job,
but it is a full-time lifestyle.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.968
- You felt the need to come back
and tell us that?

09:52.968 --> 09:57.139
- No. No, no, no. That's not all.
I'm smart, okay? I went to med school.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.224
So, you're like a retired doctor?

09:59.224 --> 10:03.270
- What? No...
I dropped out because it was stressful.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.646
You guys get that, right?

10:04.646 --> 10:09.276
School is just studying,
and overbearing parents, and raging acne.

10:09.902 --> 10:12.321
Actually, you all have perfect skin.

10:12.321 --> 10:16.200
- Things are goin' pretty great right now.
Gemma just made a boatload on NFTs.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.744
Yeah, she literally bought a boat.

10:20.412 --> 10:24.625
- You die together,
holding hands at the age of 102.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.252
Enjoy.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.465
- Beat it, kid! This is an emergency.
- Ah!

10:31.465 --> 10:32.841
- Thank you.

10:32.841 --> 10:37.179
Why is love so easy for these kids, Lou?
It makes no sense.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.264
They drive Teslas, Maggie.

10:39.264 --> 10:43.018
And I'm just some cheugy loser
who blew off her parents' expectations

10:43.018 --> 10:44.895
in the name of "personal fulfillment."

10:45.979 --> 10:49.399
Cheugy is bad, Maggie... Really bad.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.444
- It's like the second
I opened myself up to Daniel,

10:52.444 --> 10:54.196
he breaks my heart.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.657
I still owe money on my PT Cruiser.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.826
- And now I'm getting
hit on by kids in jorts.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.497
- And according to one kid,
I still need that prescription deodorant.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.291
- I gotta get outta here.
- What? Why? Where are you going?

11:06.291 --> 11:08.460
I'm going through something, Maggie,

11:08.460 --> 11:12.965
