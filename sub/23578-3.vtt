WEBVTT

00:01.776 --> 00:04.516
All right, everybody, start to shut up.

00:04.637 --> 00:06.589
Let's go ahead and wrap
up your current sentences

00:06.590 --> 00:08.240
and get yourselves to a quiet place.

00:08.241 --> 00:09.658
Mr. Griffin, Dan is in my seat.

00:09.659 --> 00:10.993
Okay, I didn't even know it was his.

00:10.994 --> 00:12.494
You added me to this weird class,

00:12.495 --> 00:13.870
and now I don't know what's going on.

00:13.871 --> 00:15.247
Calm down, calm down.

00:15.248 --> 00:16.415
Let's don't be so rule-minded.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.000
No point in your adult lives

00:18.001 --> 00:19.334
will you ever have assigned seats.

00:19.335 --> 00:21.587
- Besides airplanes.
- And jury duty.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.922
If I've already undercut
myself, don't add to it.

00:23.923 --> 00:26.508
'Kay? As you all know, this week we are

00:26.509 --> 00:30.220
devoting our attention to
the psychological dismantling

00:30.221 --> 00:33.181
of my academic rival, Miles Leonard.

00:33.182 --> 00:34.933
Miles happens to be British.

00:34.934 --> 00:37.436
He also happens to be... adopted.

00:37.437 --> 00:41.106
So this week we will
practice and perfect

00:41.107 --> 00:44.234
British accents. And whosever is best

00:44.235 --> 00:47.446
will call him, posing as
his biological birth mother

00:47.447 --> 00:50.073
who he's never met, and
tell him some sort of

00:50.074 --> 00:51.783
devastating secret.

00:54.704 --> 00:56.913
- Any questions?
- Mr. Griffin,

00:56.914 --> 00:59.291
are you seriously never
gonna teach us biology at all?

00:59.292 --> 01:01.585
Sure, Sarika. Maybe, uh,

01:01.586 --> 01:03.628
Pablo Picasso can come
in and teach driver's ed.

01:03.629 --> 01:06.757
Guys, I am a published
Harvard philosophy professor.

01:06.758 --> 01:08.258
I've no interest whatsoever

01:08.259 --> 01:10.093
in teaching biology to you people, okay?

01:10.094 --> 01:12.596
So drop it. It's a pretty
sweet deal on the table...

01:12.597 --> 01:14.431
play ball, get an A. Come
on, let's make this easy.

01:14.432 --> 01:16.558
I'm just trying to cope
through a year in Toledo

01:16.559 --> 01:18.894
with its miserable excuse for espresso.

01:20.188 --> 01:22.105
Put your hand down.

01:22.106 --> 01:25.317
Next words I hear outta you
better be in a British accent.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.235
The bookstore at the mall

01:27.236 --> 01:30.656
has good espresso... m'lord.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.492
Hey, not bad! Looks like Anthony's out

01:33.493 --> 01:35.494
to an early lead. Nice.

01:35.495 --> 01:38.497
Let's open it up. And
remember... British.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.457
Female.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.501
Hurtful. Go.

01:44.796 --> 01:47.172
The mocha latte...

01:47.173 --> 01:50.008
- I abandoned you in the loo.
- Okay, what is this class?

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.158 --> 02:16.077
Ahh...

02:17.286 --> 02:19.955
This is my sanctuary.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.379
Wha...

02:33.636 --> 02:35.053
It's fine.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.722
Ah, it's fine.

02:40.059 --> 02:41.351
Nope.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.189
I was kicked outta the bookstore.

02:46.190 --> 02:48.734
Tried to explain to the
manager that their staff "pick"

02:48.735 --> 02:51.194
was feel-good soft-core nonsense.

02:51.195 --> 02:53.572
Yeah, I happened to
gesture with my coffee hand,

02:53.573 --> 02:55.824
you know, splashed a couple
measly drops on the guy.

02:55.825 --> 02:57.909
He starts throwing the word scalded
around... "You've scalded me!"

02:58.110 --> 03:01.913
Next thing I know, this large-calfed
tyrant has his troop of baboons

03:01.914 --> 03:05.250
forcibly eject me. So... new plan.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.252
British accents weren't
exactly taking off anyway.

03:07.253 --> 03:10.422
We will now focus on taking
down the Miles display.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.049
You will infiltrate the
store by getting jobs there

03:13.050 --> 03:15.427
and changing the staff
pick, thereby giving me

03:15.428 --> 03:17.053
some semblance of sanctuary

03:17.054 --> 03:19.347
in this chili dump of a town.

03:19.348 --> 03:20.932
Did Miles do something to you?

03:20.933 --> 03:22.267
Did he get you fired from Harvard?

03:22.268 --> 03:25.479
No, Miles just has this, um...

03:25.480 --> 03:27.814
You know, he... he's like...
You know those people that...

03:27.815 --> 03:30.108
He wears scarves. Indoors,
you know what I mean?

03:30.109 --> 03:32.777
When he smiles it's
like, "Ehh..." You know?

03:32.778 --> 03:34.446
You just wanna... It's just ehh...

03:34.447 --> 03:36.239
You know, he's like one of those people.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.782
Look, do I need to go on,
or are you guys getting this?

03:37.783 --> 03:39.117
Couldn't you just find a sanctuary

03:39.118 --> 03:40.702
in a different part of the store?

03:40.703 --> 03:42.078
That seems easier than lashing out.

03:42.079 --> 03:43.622
Does everyone hear him the way I do?

03:43.623 --> 03:45.790
The grating tone? That's gonna be fatal

03:45.791 --> 03:47.125
in a job interview, bud.

03:47.126 --> 03:49.586
Mr. Griffin, we can't get jobs.

03:49.587 --> 03:51.963
Yes, you can! Look, it's easy.

03:51.964 --> 03:53.965
Couple of you get in, you flip the pic,

03:53.966 --> 03:55.800
and then quit, for all I care.

03:55.801 --> 03:57.594
I mean, look, it's a minimum wage job.

03:57.595 --> 03:59.721
These things are designed
to be revolving door.

03:59.722 --> 04:03.642
So... who here has ever
been on a job interview?

04:03.643 --> 04:06.144
Once my grandma asked me

04:06.145 --> 04:08.439
to help her dig onions in the yard.

04:09.982 --> 04:11.483
Okay. We're gonna need some practice.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.327
- Hello?
- Hey, sorry to interrupt you.

04:22.328 --> 04:26.081
It's, uh, Principal Durbin from work.

04:26.082 --> 04:28.166
I was hoping to see you

04:28.167 --> 04:29.668
in my office when you have a moment?

04:29.669 --> 04:32.087
- How's now?
- How's...

04:32.088 --> 04:33.755
Well, you're teaching a class.

04:33.756 --> 04:34.798
You can't literally mean now.

04:34.799 --> 04:36.925
I'm on my way.

04:36.926 --> 04:38.677
Well, you...

04:38.678 --> 04:41.638
Heather, I want you to
take over for me, okay?

04:41.639 --> 04:43.306
I want you to mock
interview all these people.

04:43.307 --> 04:45.934
You guys are gonna do great.
Just need a little work.

04:45.935 --> 04:48.228
It's gonna work.

04:48.229 --> 04:51.022
That's your signature
scent. She can't...

04:51.023 --> 04:52.691
Ah... pffft! She can't
take that away from you.

04:52.692 --> 04:53.775
Now, scoot.

04:53.776 --> 04:55.944
Sorry, the kids come first.

04:55.945 --> 04:57.863
- You're Jack, right?
- Yes.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.490
H.H. DeMarcus. I go by Helen.

05:00.491 --> 05:02.367
How was Harvard?

05:02.368 --> 05:03.994
How was all of Harvard?

05:03.995 --> 05:05.370
Uh...

05:05.371 --> 05:07.330
let's go with good.

05:07.331 --> 05:09.040
If Durbin's available
now, I'd love to just...

05:09.041 --> 05:11.334
The annual bake sale is coming up,

05:11.335 --> 05:13.503
and all teachers have
to bring a baked good.

05:13.504 --> 05:16.548
I do cream puffs, and
people love 'em a lot.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.049
But the most important part

05:18.050 --> 05:20.218
is that we're raisin'
money for the school.

05:20.219 --> 05:22.512
And I'm gonna write down "Raisin' Money"

05:22.513 --> 05:24.055
as a good cookie name.

05:24.056 --> 05:26.224
I write them down when they come to me.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.059
Now, you're getting off
easy because you're new,

05:28.060 --> 05:30.103
so I'm just gonna give
you chocolate chip.

05:30.104 --> 05:31.688
I should have stopped
you so much earlier.

05:31.689 --> 05:33.315
Why would I ever do that?

05:33.316 --> 05:34.733
To show us how much Ram pride ya got!

05:34.734 --> 05:36.067
Oh, I see. No, we're on the same page.

05:36.068 --> 05:37.736
Put me down as a definite no.

05:37.737 --> 05:40.238
You haven't gotten
bitten by the Ram yet.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.240
- Guess not.
- Pam the Ram's comin' at ya.

05:42.241 --> 05:44.409
- Get ready!
- Oh, the ram's name is Pam?

05:44.410 --> 05:46.578
All rams are male.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.079
Pam's a trans ram.

05:49.707 --> 05:51.416
Yeah.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.418
Okay.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.754
Jack comin' in!

05:57.882 --> 05:59.925
Time to pay the piper, Jack.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.886
Wha... I love whatever this is.

06:02.887 --> 06:04.554
Is it something from a movie?

06:04.555 --> 06:06.765
It's a Mercedes ad. Print.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.017
"Never compromise."

06:09.018 --> 06:10.936
Ah! Well, you are nailin' it.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.896
So I'm all ears.

06:12.897 --> 06:15.106
You gotta replace the school
sign that you wrecked, homeboy.

06:15.107 --> 06:17.442
Right? It was granite, very intricate,

06:17.443 --> 06:19.444
very expensive work on the ram.

06:19.445 --> 06:24.115
Jack, this is on you, and I never...

06:24.116 --> 06:26.451
compromise.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.453
It's funny... I've been
meaning to bring this up myself.

06:28.454 --> 06:31.623
See, my lawyers were asking
if the sign was far enough back

06:31.624 --> 06:33.792
from the road, legally speaking.

06:33.793 --> 06:37.462
And my neck has... really been hurting.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.422
You see, the thing is...

06:39.423 --> 06:41.591
I also never compromise.

06:41.592 --> 06:45.220
And as... a man who does not compromise,

06:45.221 --> 06:46.471
I have to respect that.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.473
And, um, I'm sure I can

06:48.474 --> 06:50.642
trim some fat from the budget

06:50.643 --> 06:53.353
and maybe find some
folks who, unlike us,

06:53.354 --> 06:56.481
- are willing to compromise.
- Ah.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.650
Ahh! Look alive, Whitlock!

06:58.651 --> 07:00.361
Durbin's on the warpath!

07:01.153 --> 07:02.612
All right, class,

07:02.613 --> 07:04.322
I'm back, so start to shut...

07:04.323 --> 07:06.534
up.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.412
Hmm.

07:10.413 --> 07:13.290
Heather, you, uh, finish
those job interviews?

07:14.458 --> 07:16.668
Yeah? Who'd ya hire?

07:16.669 --> 07:19.671
Somebody had a lotta great
references maybe, huh?

07:19.672 --> 07:21.590
Maybe the boss' nephew.

07:25.010 --> 07:27.345
Yeah.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.097
That's what I thought.

07:29.098 --> 07:31.599
These damn textbooks!

07:31.600 --> 07:34.144
You should all take a page
from how cool Dan Decker is.

07:34.145 --> 07:35.395
You're not gonna see him

07:35.396 --> 07:36.479
thumbing through a biology textbook.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.273
Nobody gave me one yet.

07:38.274 --> 07:40.984
Nobody even gave him
one. How cool is that?

07:40.985 --> 07:42.652
You know what?

07:42.653 --> 07:44.362
Line up with your books
over here. Come on.

07:44.363 --> 07:45.780
Line up with your books, let's go.

07:45.781 --> 07:47.657
Now, you see all these open windows?

07:47.658 --> 07:50.160
Aaaaanybody wanna
guess what happens next?

07:50.161 --> 07:52.036
Mr. Griffin, we can't
throw out our books.

07:52.037 --> 07:53.455
What about the AP test?

07:53.456 --> 07:55.123
Oh, can we not throw out the books?

07:55.124 --> 07:56.624
Let's go.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.710
Toss 'em, guys, toss 'em.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.133
Sarika Sarkar, you gonna be okay?

08:05.134 --> 08:07.261
Not without my book, no.

08:09.221 --> 08:10.972
Whaaaaah!

08:10.973 --> 08:12.390
- How'd you know?
- I didn't.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.642
I didn't... Hand to God, I did not know.

08:14.643 --> 08:16.269
Oh, man, I coulda really...

08:16.270 --> 08:17.437
I coulda really hurt you.

08:17.438 --> 08:19.856
Whoo! Oh, man.

08:19.857 --> 08:21.483
All right, I was gonna start
in on the interview prep,

08:21.484 --> 08:23.067
but I don't think I can do it, man.

08:23.068 --> 08:25.195
But I could get arrested for
something like that, dude.

08:27.239 --> 08:30.074
Coach. Coach Novak, I need to, uh,

08:30.075 --> 08:32.869
talk to you about the budget.

08:32.870 --> 08:35.038
I need to you, uh...

08:35.039 --> 08:38.082
I need you to cut down on field chalk.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.543
Can't be, you know,
touching that up every day.

08:40.544 --> 08:42.754
I'm not gonna compromise.

08:42.755 --> 08:44.756
I get it. We're on the same team.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.091
Bu... R... really?!

08:46.092 --> 08:47.592
But while we're talkin' budget,

08:47.593 --> 08:49.385
I need a new P.E. parachute.

08:49.386 --> 08:51.387
The old one got snagged
on a kid's belt buckle.

08:51.388 --> 08:53.056
He got whipped across the room,

08:53.057 --> 08:56.392
and his buckle gutted
that chute like a trout.

08:56.393 --> 08:58.395
"Never compromise."

09:00.147 --> 09:01.648
First off, I need to know

09:01.649 --> 09:03.358
when students get
whipped across the gym.

09:03.359 --> 09:06.694
And secondly, I'm in cutting mode, so...

09:06.695 --> 09:08.613
Oh, I see. You headed
straight to P. E., huh?

09:08.614 --> 09:10.115
Bottom of the totem pole.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.784
Dick, I understand how crucial P.E. is.

09:12.785 --> 09:15.370
You know what I do here?
I tire out the boys!

09:15.371 --> 09:17.580
You realize what a
bunch of hopped-up boys

09:17.581 --> 09:20.458
who had full energy
would do to this school?

09:20.459 --> 09:22.460
I'll get you the parachute.

09:22.461 --> 09:25.088
Find a way to fix it.

09:26.715 --> 09:28.424
If I didn't tire out the boys,

09:28.425 --> 09:31.094
this school would be rubble by lunch!

09:31.095 --> 09:33.721
Remember, people, this is
for the bookstore interview.

09:33.722 --> 09:35.807
Posture. Eye contact.

09:35.808 --> 09:37.600
And if I get the sense
you're not really trying,

09:37.601 --> 09:39.185
you get an F.

09:39.186 --> 09:43.023
I like big books, and I cannot lie.

09:44.233 --> 09:46.317
I have a 4.125 GPA.

09:46.318 --> 09:48.111
Never talk about grades. No one cares.

09:48.112 --> 09:49.988
They have no impact on life.

09:49.989 --> 09:50.989
Next!

09:50.990 --> 09:52.615
And greatest weakness?

09:52.616 --> 09:54.617
- My neck.
- Very literal.

09:54.618 --> 09:58.329
I couldn't even hold my head
up until I was five years old.

09:58.330 --> 09:59.789
The only job I've ever had

09:59.790 --> 10:01.916
was babysitting my little brother.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.501
Look, you guys are trying to
make a good impression here,

10:03.502 --> 10:05.128
so you're gonna have to straight-up lie.

10:05.129 --> 10:07.338
If you don't, someone
else will, so it's fine.

10:07.339 --> 10:09.174
It's called holistic consequentialism:

10:09.175 --> 10:11.676
the consequences are the
same either way, so...

10:11.677 --> 10:13.595
lying. Go!

10:13.596 --> 10:15.305
My dad is author Stephen King.

10:15.306 --> 10:17.307
I have a normal-strength neck.

10:17.308 --> 10:19.100
If I hear something behind me,

10:19.101 --> 10:21.144
I turn and look without effort.

10:21.145 --> 10:23.146
Well, I hope you're
all inheriting money,

10:23.147 --> 10:24.856
because you're completely unhirable.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.608
I have no choice but to
take a run at this myself,

10:26.609 --> 10:28.485
so get the hell outta my sight.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.379
Now we don't have books?

10:32.549 --> 10:34.383
We might lose a whole academic year.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.260
- We have to do something.
- But what?

10:36.261 --> 10:37.804
He has all the power.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.639
We should all show up at his house,

10:39.640 --> 10:41.224
ambush him, and refuse to leave

10:41.225 --> 10:42.934
until he gives us our books back.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.227
- Who's in?
- I'm in.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.978
I wanna see a professor's house.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.981
I bet it's like the library
from "Beauty and the Beast."

10:48.982 --> 10:50.817
We should ask Dan Decker.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.487
He's scary, but Mr. Griffin likes him.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.372
_

11:04.373 --> 11:06.457
Where is that son of a...

11:09.169 --> 11:12.505
Jack, you are squeezing
that pen so hard.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.631
What are you working on?

11:13.632 --> 11:15.842
- Revenge.
- Oh ho ho ho.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.426
- "Revenge"!
- Somebody call Shonda!

11:17.427 --> 11:19.136
- Revenge!
- Little too dramatic.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.429
"Shonda"...

11:20.430 --> 11:21.973
There he is!

11:21.974 --> 11:23.933
Oh, God, not now, Helen, please.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.352
I... I'm working on a writing
project of great importance.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.855
Exactly. You're a big
brainiac with these

11:28.856 --> 11:31.524
big thoughts, and there's no
room in your head for cookies.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.484
That's why I made it even easier for ya.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.861
You know,

11:34.862 --> 11:37.321
I'm not some absentminded
nutty professor

11:37.322 --> 11:39.824
who's baffled by baking.
I simply don't wanna do it.

11:39.825 --> 11:43.369
"Nutty Professor" is the
perfect name for your cookies!

11:43.370 --> 11:45.162
That maniac doesn't care

11:45.163 --> 11:46.372
about first impressions at all.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.458
Okay. What? Iron out your panties, Jack.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.210
- Listen...
- Yes, Batman?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.546
I do not bake cookies...

11:53.547 --> 11:55.172
and I will never waver on that.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.884
- Look at his nostrils.
- Girl, they are flaring.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.010
- Has anyone seen my mug?
- Which one.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.386
My Michelle mug.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.221
It's got my name on it, Michelle?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.726
Thank you for calling
Bartholemew's Bookstore.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.061
We appreciate your call.

12:14.278 --> 12:17.071
What is time? Why are we here?

12:17.072 --> 12:18.448
- I'm Miles Leonard...
- No.

12:18.449 --> 12:19.949
- Representative!
- Philosopher

12:19.950 --> 12:21.409
- and MacArthur Genius.
- Representative!

12:21.410 --> 12:22.785
"The Question IS the Answer."

12:22.786 --> 12:25.121
What is time?

12:25.122 --> 12:27.332
Why are we here?

12:27.333 --> 12:29.125
I'm Miles Leonard, philosopher

12:29.126 --> 12:31.210
- and MacArthur Genius.
- Representative!

12:31.211 --> 12:32.920
"The Question IS the Answer."

12:32.921 --> 12:36.257
What is time? Why are we here?

12:36.258 --> 12:38.092
I'm Miles Leonard, Philosopher...

12:38.093 --> 12:40.720
- Oh, shut up!
- My book, "The Question

12:40.721 --> 12:42.096
IS the answer."

12:46.143 --> 12:48.311
Representative!

12:48.312 --> 12:51.564
Let's go around back.

12:51.565 --> 12:53.399
Hello? Bartholemew's. Kyle speaking.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.068
Hold on, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

12:55.069 --> 12:56.069
Hello?

12:57.154 --> 12:58.613
What do you mean, you don't get involved

12:58.614 --> 13:00.281
in regional staff pics? What if Cliff

13:00.282 --> 13:01.991
and his underlings picked "Mein Kampf"?

13:01.992 --> 13:04.661
You've never heard... Well,
it's Adolf Hitler's manifesto.

13:04.662 --> 13:06.537
You might wanna look it up.

13:06.538 --> 13:08.998
"Mein" is spelled like chow mein,

13:08.999 --> 13:10.833
"Kampf" is spelled
like camp. but with a K,

13:10.834 --> 13:12.251
and stick an F at the end.

13:12.252 --> 13:14.170
No, no, no, no, no, do-do-don't...

13:14.171 --> 13:16.130
What is time? Why are we here?

13:16.131 --> 13:17.840
I'm Miles Leonard.

13:17.841 --> 13:20.760
We should leave. This
feels like an intrusion.

13:20.761 --> 13:23.096
Are you kidding? We can use this.

13:23.097 --> 13:25.473
- Ah!
- New plan. If this guy's

13:25.474 --> 13:27.684
gonna teach us, we need to help him.

13:27.685 --> 13:30.019
We can't take advantage of whatever...

13:30.020 --> 13:31.354
this is.

13:34.191 --> 13:35.608
Where are you going?

13:35.609 --> 13:37.276
Stick with the plan. He's vulnerable!

13:37.277 --> 13:40.863
You guys are wimps! I
should have brought girls.

13:40.864 --> 13:42.741
Waaaah!

13:46.880 --> 13:48.380
Okay, here he comes.

13:48.381 --> 13:49.715
Everybody remember, be gentle.

13:49.716 --> 13:51.050
This is a man on the edge.

13:51.051 --> 13:53.010
All right, everybody, pipe down.

13:53.011 --> 13:55.138
This plan's on life-support.

13:58.683 --> 14:00.017
Is this a Mormon school?

14:00.018 --> 14:02.019
No, silly!

14:02.020 --> 14:04.647
We're doing more interview
prep today, right, Sarika?

14:04.648 --> 14:06.774
Yeah. I'm psyched about it.

14:06.775 --> 14:10.027
We made official resumes.

14:10.028 --> 14:12.446
I watched "Working Girl" last night.

14:12.447 --> 14:15.699
Guys, this is a massive
improvement in attitude.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.786
- Ha.
- This is much more interesting than biology.

14:18.787 --> 14:21.038
Thank you. I... I hate knowledge.

14:21.039 --> 14:22.957
Don't imply that I hate knowledge,

14:22.958 --> 14:25.834
but, uh, yeah, why don't we
jump into some interview prep?

14:25.835 --> 14:29.047
Right off the bat, I am
seeing way too many bolo ties.

14:31.925 --> 14:33.467
Durbin Outfitters!

14:33.468 --> 14:35.719
- Durbin Outfitters!
- Hel-lo!

14:35.720 --> 14:37.888
We heard you're giving out money...

14:37.889 --> 14:39.723
No! Who told you that? Is
that what people are saying?

14:39.724 --> 14:42.226
My kids need a monitor
for presentations.

14:42.227 --> 14:45.229
Mine need a microphone
also for presentations.

14:45.230 --> 14:47.064
And my kids need this technology

14:47.065 --> 14:49.316
where song lyrics pop up
at the bottom of the screen

14:49.317 --> 14:51.235
and there's like a waterfall
and a woman riding a horse.

14:51.236 --> 14:52.736
A... a karaoke machine?

14:52.737 --> 14:54.154
I can't buy you a karaoke machine!

14:54.155 --> 14:55.739
I'm looking for cuts!

14:55.740 --> 14:58.742
Come on, Durbs. The
staff karaoke machine

14:58.743 --> 15:01.495
has been broken for the
last three semesters.

15:01.496 --> 15:03.414
I know there's a song in you.

15:03.415 --> 15:05.874
I do a pretty good...

15:05.875 --> 15:07.584
"Thriller," along with
the Vincent Price part.

15:07.585 --> 15:08.836
Yes!

15:08.837 --> 15:11.964
I knew it!

15:11.965 --> 15:13.632
Gotta do it... I love it!

15:13.633 --> 15:14.675
All right.

15:19.931 --> 15:23.893
Oh, crud, I just bought
a karaoke machine.

15:29.274 --> 15:33.068
Oh, geez. There's my sad little guy!

15:33.069 --> 15:34.445
Oh...

15:34.446 --> 15:36.864
- Whooooh!
- Oh, my God, what is this?

15:36.865 --> 15:38.902
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm tapped into your kids, Jack.

15:39.123 --> 15:41.352
They told me what happened...

15:41.453 --> 15:44.621
how you microwaved that
fast food taco with lettuce.

15:44.622 --> 15:45.956
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:45.957 --> 15:47.875
- The kids were at my house?
- Yeah.

15:47.876 --> 15:50.461
They saw you drinking
and practicing punching,

15:50.462 --> 15:52.921
and they were worried you were having

15:52.922 --> 15:55.174
some kinda breakdown, so they
wanted to do something for you.

15:55.175 --> 15:56.717
That's the reason they went along

15:56.718 --> 15:58.135
with everything I said
today... out of pity?

15:58.136 --> 15:59.803
No. Ram pride!

15:59.804 --> 16:01.805
When one of our own has their horns

16:01.806 --> 16:04.308
stuck in that fence, we're there

16:04.309 --> 16:06.310
to pull 'em by the
caboose, and that is why

16:06.311 --> 16:08.145
you are off cookie duty.

16:08.146 --> 16:10.147
Because you're just
under too much strain.

16:10.148 --> 16:12.649
I'm under no strain at
all... my life is great, okay?

16:12.650 --> 16:14.485
And there is absolutely
nothing difficult

16:14.486 --> 16:15.986
about baking cookies.

16:15.987 --> 16:18.238
Sorry, pal, because it's a no.

16:18.239 --> 16:19.990
They would be blood cookies,

16:19.991 --> 16:21.992
paid for with your sanity.

16:21.993 --> 16:24.453
You're a ridiculous
person. I'm gonna go.

16:24.454 --> 16:26.497
Okay.

16:26.498 --> 16:28.999
I was pitied by a pack of dweebs?

16:33.546 --> 16:36.715
Dan Decker. Are you part
of that dork recon team

16:36.716 --> 16:38.842
that's peeping in my windows?

16:38.843 --> 16:40.260
No.

16:40.261 --> 16:42.931
No one really loops me in on anything.

16:48.269 --> 16:50.187
You, uh...

16:50.188 --> 16:52.523
always come out here and
eat lunch by yourself?

16:52.524 --> 16:54.358
Thought you'd be like on a team

16:54.359 --> 16:56.319
or part of a bully crew or something.

16:57.695 --> 17:01.198
Come on, man. What's the deal?

17:01.199 --> 17:03.158
I moved here from
Florida like a year ago,

17:03.159 --> 17:06.703
and I'm kinda not that
great at making friends.

17:06.704 --> 17:08.790
Can't even talk to the A. P. Bio kids.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.376
Is that Heather from class
and the body of Wonder Woman?

17:12.377 --> 17:13.544
No, no.

17:13.545 --> 17:15.045
It...

17:15.046 --> 17:16.755
You just gotta give
them something they want.

17:16.756 --> 17:19.090
You probably just have to
say the word "Dumbledore,"

17:19.092 --> 17:21.050
and they'd all high-five
each other and go nuts.

17:21.051 --> 17:24.221
But that's not really the path
I like for you anyway, man.

17:24.222 --> 17:26.640
I see you more as like a lone wolf.

17:26.641 --> 17:29.560
I mean, sure, people try to
rope you into their bake sales,

17:29.561 --> 17:31.812
but... take it from this guy.

17:31.813 --> 17:33.981
The life of a lone wolf
can be pretty sweet.

17:33.982 --> 17:36.024
Dude, I don't wanna be like you.

17:36.025 --> 17:37.360
Your life's a mess.

17:39.237 --> 17:41.238
My life's a mess?

17:41.239 --> 17:44.075
Y... you chose to eat next to trash!

18:09.823 --> 18:13.118
Hey, where do you think
you're going with that?

18:13.785 --> 18:15.452
Hey... hey!

18:47.986 --> 18:49.695
This is a croquembouche.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.781
much like your cream
puffs, but more impressive.

18:52.782 --> 18:56.660
It is you who will have
the mental breakdown, Helen.

18:56.661 --> 18:59.830
This is a one-time exception.
Write down everything I say

18:59.831 --> 19:02.791
right now. First, never
dress like this again.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.461
Second, I took down
the Miles cutout myself.

19:05.462 --> 19:07.546
I've been banned from
the bookstore for life,

19:07.547 --> 19:09.381
but... that's okay.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.050
The only true sanctuary
I'll have in this town

19:11.051 --> 19:13.343
is between these two ears right here.

19:13.344 --> 19:16.513
Third, and finally, never pity me.

19:16.514 --> 19:18.390
Did any of you go to Harvard?

19:18.391 --> 19:21.018
Have any of you slept with 24 women?

19:21.019 --> 19:23.854
What you saw when you
trespassed on my property

19:23.855 --> 19:25.022
was a man who eats what he wants,

19:25.023 --> 19:26.190
drinks what he wants,

19:26.191 --> 19:29.401
wears... what he wants.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.154
It is a lifestyle most high
school kids would kill for.

19:32.155 --> 19:35.240
It's sad to me that you can't see that.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.367
The only embarrassing part of my day

19:37.368 --> 19:40.746
is the 55 minutes I have to spend here.

19:45.877 --> 19:48.253
One more thing, though.

19:48.254 --> 19:51.090
Does anyone have anything to say about

19:51.091 --> 19:52.758
Dumbledore?

19:52.759 --> 19:55.761
- Well, actually...
- Dumbledore was clearly...

19:58.014 --> 19:59.598
Pipe down! Stop!

19:59.599 --> 20:01.725
Stop. Pipe down, pipe down.

20:01.726 --> 20:04.311
One at a time. Let's start with... Dan.

20:04.312 --> 20:05.939
You have the floor.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.450
If you're so embarrassed
to teach this class,

20:18.451 --> 20:19.952
Miles is probably the last person

20:19.953 --> 20:21.703
you want getting that picture.

20:21.704 --> 20:24.916
He won't, if you give
the bio textbooks back.

20:26.209 --> 20:29.294
Like you said: Give them what they want.

20:32.882 --> 20:35.051
Ha.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.971
One chapter. Of my choosing.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.973
From the middle of the book.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.224
