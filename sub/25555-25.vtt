I sleeping tonight?

00:07.708 --> 00:08.741

I really probably don't
wanna go on this date.

it's just weird.

the beach house early.
No!

Are we dating?

You're under arrest
for battery.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.125

it's a notice to appear.

world upside down.

that there are consequences
for her actions.

We have to be aware
of our actions.
Yeah.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.569

19:07.747 --> 19:09.881
So, what was y'all favorite
part of the summer?

19:11.951 --> 19:14.752
I used that for
jacky-jacky once.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.588
(chuckling)

19:17.657 --> 19:18.956
Y'all can keep it.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.392
(Gus)
Do you have any regrets,
Candace, of this summer?

19:21.461 --> 19:24.295
I think my biggest regret

19:24.364 --> 19:26.063
was not breaking up
with Gator sooner.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.032
Yeah.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.967
But it's okay.
Now I like turtles.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.136
(all chuckling)

19:32.205 --> 19:33.938
(Kirk)
Kind of looks like
Codi to me, but...

19:34.007 --> 19:35.540
(all laughing)

19:35.608 --> 19:37.041
It kinda does.

19:37.110 --> 19:40.144
Wow, like, I'm really about
to leave the beach house today.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.080
It's so bittersweet.
I'm about to leave...

19:43.149 --> 19:46.083
my family I got here
and go back home to...

19:46.152 --> 19:47.985
my family-family
in Memphis.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.054
You want your Henny?

19:50.123 --> 19:51.489
Hell, yeah,
I want my Henny.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.424
Do y'all wanna take a shot
with me before we go?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.059
Yes, let's go downstairs.

19:55.128 --> 19:59.230
(Candace)
It's the same bottle Codi
gave me on our first date.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.499
It's a bottle of Hendog.
My favorite liquor.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.634
So, you know what I'm saying,
we gotta take a shot.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.637
Before we take the shot, y'all,
I'll be right back.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.041
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.409
(Gus mimicking
brakes squealing)

20:11.477 --> 20:15.479
Sorry, Codi, gotta get a quickie
before I leave, you know?

20:15.548 --> 20:18.516
Ohh... damn.
(all laughing)

20:18.585 --> 20:20.184
Mister Steal
Your Girl (bleep).

20:20.253 --> 20:22.720
Come on, Nilsa, come on,
I'm upset.
Let's go (bleep) real quick.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.522
(laughing)

20:24.591 --> 20:26.490
Let's do it.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.192
(Candace)
Jeremiah!
Yeah?

20:28.261 --> 20:30.695
So, we got you
a little present.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.830
You got me a present?
We did.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.366
A huge favor for everybody
in this house

20:35.435 --> 20:37.602
and the entire world, and this
is for the greater good.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.936
What? No.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.238
And it's 'cause we care
about you, Jeremiah.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.273
It's not, it's not my
palm tree outfit, is it?

20:42.342 --> 20:44.275
Don't take it from me.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.010
(Candace)
We're not gonna
take it from you.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.279
We just wanna make sure
you can't ever wear it again.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.148
So, what we've
done is we've framed it.

20:51.217 --> 20:54.118
(laughing)

20:54.187 --> 20:56.320
And it is sealed away
for good.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.122
That palm tree shirt
needed to be framed

20:58.191 --> 21:00.491
for the better
good of the world.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.659
This is for the whole world,

21:01.728 --> 21:02.893
so they don't have
to look at this no more.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.563
That is (bleep) too funny.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.731
You take this with you.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.499
Don't you open it.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.667
Or else.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.569
How am I gonna get
this on the plane?

21:11.638 --> 21:12.903
Good luck.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.405
We didn't think
about that, sorry.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.107
Yeah.
(laughing)

21:16.175 --> 21:18.709
I love these people so much.
We gotta do it for the one time.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.811
Chichis up!

21:20.880 --> 21:22.880
All right, y'all want me
to lead this last one?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.382
Yup, your last one.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.050
Dear Heavenly Father,

21:26.119 --> 21:29.587
thank you so much for this
incredible summer, Lord God.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.657
Thank you for all seven
individuals that I've met.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.393
I just wanna ask that you keep
your heavenly arms of protection

21:35.461 --> 21:37.828
around every single individual
in this house, Lord God.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.499
That you keep us safe as we all
travel home, Lord God.

21:41.567 --> 21:45.169
Um, that it is in your will
that we all stay close

21:45.238 --> 21:46.971
and that we all have
each other's back,

21:47.040 --> 21:49.707
and that we remember that family
is the most important.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.842
Loyalty is the most important.
Always.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.745
Thank you for being with all
of us throughout the summertime.

21:54.814 --> 21:58.382
Thank you for just everything,
Lord God, and...

21:58.451 --> 22:00.418
Well, there's no food.
Amen.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.419
(laughing)
Amen.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.787
Hey, family hug.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.155
(Codi)
Yeah, aw...

22:04.223 --> 22:05.222
(Nilsa)
Hurry, Candace.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.191
(Candace)
Coming up...

22:07.260 --> 22:08.592
Wait!

22:08.661 --> 22:12.063
I'm, like, man,
she's really leaving.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.832
What if this is the last
time I get to see her?

22:14.901 --> 22:16.300
I can't have no regrets.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.501
(Jeremiah)
Get in there, Codi!

22:17.570 --> 22:19.003
(Candace laughing)

22:24.077 --> 22:26.977
Your taxi's here.
For real?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.946
No!
(horn honks)

22:29.015 --> 22:30.214
She's not
coming with you!

22:30.283 --> 22:31.615
She's not going!

22:31.684 --> 22:33.851
(honking continues)

22:33.920 --> 22:36.987
(Jeremiah)
Hey, let's start
taking her stuff out.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.825
Candace is leaving,
and it's kind of heartbreaking.

22:40.893 --> 22:44.395
That's, like, the person that
I turn to and I pray with and...

22:44.464 --> 22:46.897
just sucks to see her go.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.933
(Candace)
Aah!

22:49.001 --> 22:50.501
(Kortni chuckles)

22:54.207 --> 22:56.640
No! No!
(laughter)

22:56.709 --> 22:58.809
I'm going with you!

22:58.878 --> 23:00.277
Get your friend.
Get your friend.

23:00.346 --> 23:01.779
Don't leave me!
Bye, girlie.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.515
Come here, I will, I will.
Be good.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.150
And remember something.
Don't worry about what

23:06.219 --> 23:07.885
anybody got to say--
God's loving everything.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.120
Thank you. That means
more than you know

23:09.188 --> 23:10.654
Thank you, seriously.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.790
(Candace)
Come here.

23:19.232 --> 23:20.531
Yeah!

23:20.600 --> 23:23.768
(laughing)

23:23.836 --> 23:26.036
(Kirk)
Candace is giving us
her hugs goodbye.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.538
Codi's turn comes around,

23:27.607 --> 23:29.740
and he goes to plant one
right on the kisser.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.142
Did you see that kiss?
(laughing)

23:31.210 --> 23:34.245
Oh, my gosh,
now that is a goodbye.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.313
I'm taken aback.

23:36.382 --> 23:38.315
I am completely shocked
right now, I'm, like...

23:38.384 --> 23:40.484
Did Codi just
lay a kiss on me?

23:40.553 --> 23:43.354
I did not think Codi would
make that kind of move.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.323
Codi, you caught me
off guard with that one.

23:46.392 --> 23:47.625
The element
of surprise, baby.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.727
(laughing)
I feel like that was the only

23:49.796 --> 23:51.762
way fitting for Codi to say
goodbye to Candace because

23:51.831 --> 23:53.597
they don't exactly know
where they stand.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.266
That was good.
That was good.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.934
You know, they went out.
They had a great date.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.669
Smooth, baby, I'm smooth.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.471
And so Codi let her know
exactly where they stand

24:00.540 --> 24:02.573
by kissing her right
before she left.

24:02.642 --> 24:05.342
(Candace)
Al right, y'all!

24:05.411 --> 24:07.111
(laughing)
Don't burn it down.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.113
You're not leaving!

24:09.182 --> 24:10.881
(laughing)

24:10.950 --> 24:12.016
Nilsa, move!

24:12.084 --> 24:13.584
Uh, feel free to back up
at any time, sir.

24:13.653 --> 24:14.585
(laughing)

24:14.654 --> 24:15.986
Just run her over.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.556
And, listen, if you feel a bump,
it's okay, just keep going.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.191
No! No! No!

24:20.259 --> 24:22.460
(Nilsa)
It's becoming real that
the summer's coming to an end.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.261
We don't know where life
is gonna take us.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.496
We don't if we're gonna
get another summer

24:25.565 --> 24:27.798
in the beach house,
all together as a family.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.234
(Aimee)
Now it feels empty.
It don't feel right.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.635
(Codi)
I know.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.972
And so, watching her leave,
it just makes me wanna make

24:35.041 --> 24:38.676
the last few days
in the beach house the best
it possibly can be.

24:38.744 --> 24:42.313
Edible Cookie
Posse forever!
(laughing)

24:42.381 --> 24:46.784
Oh, wait, I left Jeremiah's
shorts in my drawer.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.953
Hold on, y'all, I gotta go get
something real quick.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.889
What'd you forget?
Just stay out here.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.657
As I'm about
to pull off in the taxi,

24:53.726 --> 24:58.195
I remember that I have
Jeremiah's palm tree shorts
in my drawer.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.865
And you know what?
I think I'm gonna take 'em
to Memphis with me.

25:00.933 --> 25:04.235
To make sure he can't
wear that thing ever again!

25:04.303 --> 25:06.403
(Gus)
Got it?
(Aimee)
Got it? Love you.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.405
(Nilsa)
What's in her pants?

25:08.474 --> 25:10.374
(Aimee)
The Hennessey bottle.
(Gus)
Yes!

25:10.443 --> 25:11.442
(Codi)
Ohh!

25:11.511 --> 25:12.443
(Gus)
Leave with it!

25:12.512 --> 25:13.511
Bye!

25:13.579 --> 25:15.646
Taxi, go!
Taxi, go!

25:15.715 --> 25:17.748
(overlapping shouting)

25:17.817 --> 25:20.050
(Aimee)
Lock the door, Candace!

25:20.119 --> 25:22.520
Wait! Wait!

25:22.588 --> 25:24.054
(laughing)

25:24.123 --> 25:27.391
(Codi)
Wait, I want one more kiss!
I want one more kiss!

25:27.460 --> 25:29.994
I'm, like, man.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.028
She's really leaving.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.496
This is it.

25:32.565 --> 25:33.864
Can't have no regrets.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.567
One more kiss!
One more kiss!

25:36.636 --> 25:37.902
All them gym sessions
are paying off

25:37.970 --> 25:40.638
'cause I've never
seen Codi run that fast.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.839
(Jeremiah)
Get in there, Codi!

25:41.908 --> 25:43.541
(laughing)

25:43.609 --> 25:44.642
What?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.410
I want one more kiss.

25:46.479 --> 25:48.946
Oh, my God! Codi!
One more kiss.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.614
(all cheering)

25:50.683 --> 25:53.617
(Nilsa)
Yay! I believe
in a thing called love!

25:53.686 --> 25:55.452
Now that's a goodbye.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.521
(Jeremiah)
Oh, Codi!

25:57.590 --> 26:00.624
Oh, my God,
they are too much.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.727
Oh, my gosh.
This send-off could not
have been any better.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.996
I could not believe I'm about
to leave these people.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.432
(Aimee)
Nilsa, get out of the road!

26:08.501 --> 26:11.068
Waah!

26:11.137 --> 26:12.736
And then
there were seven.

26:12.805 --> 26:13.771
Feels weird already.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.139
(Aimee)
I know.
It's really weird.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.174
Codi, you kissed Candace.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.509
Twice.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.811
This is a transitional period
in our relationship.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.013
Or if there's gonna
be a relationship, who knows?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.783
I don't know but I know things
will not go back to the same.

26:25.851 --> 26:26.784
How was
the second one?

26:26.852 --> 26:28.552
Better than the first?

26:28.621 --> 26:31.155
Got two kisses....
you know.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.223
That means a little bit.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.825
I'm worried about the girls.
She's the glue

26:34.894 --> 26:37.027
that holds y'all together.
What are y'all gonna do?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.162

27:45.731 --> 27:47.364
(loud kissing)

27:47.433 --> 27:50.334
Josh just might be what I need.

27:50.403 --> 27:51.735
You're not ready.
I am.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.237
I could be in
the worst mood.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.839
And then someone
brings you up.
My whole mood changes.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.574
When you call me,
I'm so excited.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.043
I, like, wanna run
around the house

27:59.111 --> 28:00.678
like a little girl screaming.
I'm sorry.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.215
Josh did me wrong last summer,
and so my first reaction is

28:05.284 --> 28:08.585
just throw the phone
on the couch, "Jeremiah!

28:08.654 --> 28:10.220
It's your brother."

28:11.590 --> 28:14.158
What's up, you little
crumb snatcher.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.900
Oh, hell, yeah, man.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.802
Absolutely.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.404
Is he saying
he's coming here?

28:27.473 --> 28:28.439
I don't know.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.409
Yes, absolutely, man.

28:32.478 --> 28:33.677
The fact that Candace left

28:33.746 --> 28:35.713
and now my brother
is coming to the beach house,

28:35.781 --> 28:38.682
it's, like, perfect timing.
But I'm a little worried

28:38.751 --> 28:40.818
about Nilsa,
because for some reason,

28:40.886 --> 28:44.188
this girl has a hard time
with letting go.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.856
Hey, what time
are you gonna be here?

28:49.762 --> 28:51.195
(Gus laughing)
7:30?

28:54.667 --> 28:59.269
(laughing)

28:59.338 --> 29:01.672
I will relay
the message, boy.

29:01.741 --> 29:02.706
<i> All right, later.</i>

29:02.775 --> 29:05.175
All right, later.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.911
Oh, boy!

29:07.980 --> 29:09.413
Yikes.

29:09.482 --> 29:12.082
(chuckling)

29:12.151 --> 29:14.251
Uh, let me see.
Josh is coming tonight.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.487
Is there any way that
it's gonna be peaceful?

29:16.555 --> 29:19.289
Mmm, hell, no.
Doubt it.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.059
Nilsa, Josh just told me
to relay the message.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.962
He just said to get shaved up
and ready for him, okay?

29:25.030 --> 29:26.096
(chuckling)

29:27.433 --> 29:28.932
(Jeremiah sighs)

29:29.001 --> 29:31.301
The only Josh I know
hurt my best friend, Nilsa.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.571
This is such (bleep)
bull(bleep), dude.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.407
Hope it's not that Josh.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.743
This is our last
mother(bleep) weekend.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.311
(Jeremiah)
Oh, boy.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.213
What the hell's he doing
in Panama City?

29:43.282 --> 29:46.917
I don't know.
But, damn it, he's coming.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.619
To the house or where?

29:48.687 --> 29:50.053
Yeah, he's gonna
be here at 7:30.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.089
To the house-house?
Yes, house-house.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.624
That's what
I'm talking about.

29:53.692 --> 29:57.127
Drop your shoes
on, boy, get ready.
Yikes.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.429
I just feel so uncomfortable.
I'm, like, I feel

29:59.498 --> 30:01.465
so uncomfortable with him
being here, like...

30:01.534 --> 30:03.033
(bleep) him
and his flower shirt.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.902
I wonder what
Nilsa will do.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.370
(Gus)
You know, with Josh coming
to town, there's honestly

30:06.438 --> 30:08.472
no doubt in my mind that he's
probably gonna try to bark up

30:08.541 --> 30:10.641
that same tree and see if
Nilsa's still about it.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.643
You think she's
gonna do it again?

30:12.711 --> 30:15.846
We'll see.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.649
And for him to say
get shaved up and ready.
That's what he said.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.918
He said that?
Yes.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.986
You know what, Nilsa,
he is such a (bleep) douche.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.422
(Nilsa)
I need to go get
an outfit for tonight,

30:25.491 --> 30:26.423
so I need you
to get up, please.

30:29.728 --> 30:32.563
(Aimee)
With Josh, Gus and Jeremiah
in the house,

30:32.631 --> 30:35.132
I feel like Nilsa
has so much to worry about.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.168
I just pray that
they do not dog her.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.004
Jeremiah, I really don't feel
comfortable with Josh coming.

30:41.073 --> 30:44.241
But, so, please
have enough respect for me
if he says anything

30:44.310 --> 30:46.009
out of line to just
nip it in the bud, okay?

30:46.078 --> 30:47.845
Sure, sure.
Promise?

30:47.913 --> 30:49.112
Yeah.
'Cause I really
don't wanna

30:49.181 --> 30:51.481
have to spend my last couple
days here in misery.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.016
It'll be all in good fun.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.985
Huh?
I'm sure he's gonna say

30:55.054 --> 30:57.955
something about you and Gus
hooking up, but it's not like
he's doing it vindictively.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.423
It's just out of good fun.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.592
Well, that's fine,
but anything personal

31:01.660 --> 31:03.193
that we've already squashed,

31:03.262 --> 31:04.595
I don't want to be
brought up at all.

31:04.663 --> 31:05.596
Like what?

31:05.664 --> 31:06.663
Everything.

31:06.732 --> 31:07.898
Like what?

31:07.967 --> 31:10.400
Just anything between
me and him or anything.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.935
I don't know what you guys are--
what you're talking about.

31:12.004 --> 31:15.072
I think you're
over-thinking it.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.342
Look, girl, he's coming
to see his brother that
he hasn't seen in months.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.344
Do you really think
he's gonna worry about petty

31:20.412 --> 31:22.813
bull(bleep) with you?
I doubt it.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.715
To the gym.
To the gym.

31:24.783 --> 31:27.551
There was a reason why he left
you in Panama City Beach

31:27.620 --> 31:29.720
last year-- because
he was over the fact

31:29.788 --> 31:31.288
that you weren't
over your ex.

31:31.357 --> 31:34.558
I think you can
drop it, Nilsa.

31:34.627 --> 31:38.095
Candace leaving, us doing,
like, our last gym trip.

31:38.163 --> 31:41.298
(Gus)
Oh, sad. It's all
coming to an end, dog.

31:41.367 --> 31:42.733
(Jeremiah)
It's all said and done.

31:42.801 --> 31:45.168
I just don't know what to expect
when Josh gets here, man.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.472
There won't be a dull
moment, that's for sure.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.874
Trust me when I say this.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.776
Nilsa still has feelings
for my brother Josh.

31:52.845 --> 31:55.245
When I met you, like,
I don't give a (bleep)
about him anymore.

31:55.314 --> 31:56.780
I met you and I like you.

31:56.849 --> 31:58.615
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm going home.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.417
This is so (bleep) up.

32:00.486 --> 32:01.585
(whimpers)

32:01.654 --> 32:03.553
You know, because of
the tension of everything,

32:03.622 --> 32:05.022
Nilsa is gonna
throw back drinks.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.124
You know how she is when
she throws back drinks.

32:07.192 --> 32:08.759
Very handsy.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.994
So, at this point, I'm a little
worried about Gus.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.930
Because he might
be a little jealous.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.599
It's gonna be interesting
to see how Gus takes it.

32:15.668 --> 32:18.435
It's gonna be, uh...
interesting.

32:18.504 --> 32:19.937
(man)
Coming up...

32:23.642 --> 32:25.509
I don't really know how I'm
gonna feel whenever Josh comes.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.644
I could wanna
give him the Perdido Special.

32:27.713 --> 32:31.281
Or I could wanna hunch him.
I don't know.

That was ridiculous.

It was like sweet joy I had.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.227
You told her
Josh was coming.

you better stop.

36:36.094 --> 36:38.428
I know Josh doesn't give
a (bleep) about my feelings.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.797
And I hooked up
with Gus this summer.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.267
So, I don't wanna be made
to feel like I'm a slut

36:44.336 --> 36:48.205
or I'm a whore because I did
hook up with Jeremiah's brother,

36:48.273 --> 36:50.073
who is now friends with Gus.

36:50.142 --> 36:51.775
It's the same as when
they crack jokes at us.

36:51.843 --> 36:52.943
It's the same thing.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.377
Yeah, that's at us.
I don't wanna

36:54.446 --> 36:55.679
feel singled out, and I don't
wanna get my feelings hurt.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.147
I'm not gonna push it to
the point where you're being

36:57.216 --> 36:59.049
singled out,
I promise.
Okay.

36:59.117 --> 37:01.117
I don't wanna be the center
of their laughter.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.587
(Codi)
I mean, I wanna know what are
you gonna do when he gets here?

37:03.655 --> 37:06.256
You know how he is.
You know, you think
he gives a (bleep)?

37:06.325 --> 37:07.891
He's just gonna go in.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.893
I know he doesn't.

37:09.962 --> 37:12.395
But that-- that's the point.
That's the point.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.497
I'm not gonna be the one...

37:14.566 --> 37:16.299
The one to what?
Act out of character.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.400
(phone ringing)

37:17.469 --> 37:18.568
That's his character.

37:18.637 --> 37:19.869
I'm not gonna let him
get the best of me.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.538
Oh, (bleep).

37:21.607 --> 37:25.041
(Codi)
Listen, if Gus or Josh start in,

37:25.110 --> 37:26.443
it's gonna be like somebody

37:26.511 --> 37:29.446
threw a whole tank of gasoline
on this summer.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.014
And Nilsa's gonna explode.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.582
Good luck.

37:39.491 --> 37:42.726
♪♪

37:46.031 --> 37:48.965
(bleep)! I have 15 minutes
to (bleep) get ready.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.434
I shaved my vagina.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.702
What?

37:52.771 --> 37:54.504
Ha ha ha...
wow.

37:54.573 --> 37:55.639
Must be special.

37:55.707 --> 37:58.708
(Kortni)
Tryin' to get
the (bleep), y'all.

37:58.777 --> 37:59.709
Kortni...

38:01.980 --> 38:04.447
(Codi)
I'm excited for you,
I really am.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.117
I mean, guy must be special
to shave that cookie.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.519
So you're pretty much saying
your (bleep) tonight.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.720
Maybe.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.122
Just promise me this.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.724
You don't fall in love
in three weeks.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.526
Can I, um,
knock you out?

38:16.595 --> 38:18.028
No, I'm just
keeping it real.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.629
It was three weeks
with the old dude.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.064
I don't even wanna say his name.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.532
And she's, like, "Oh, I love
him. I want his kids.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.534
We're getting married."
So to see her going on a date

38:24.603 --> 38:26.836
this soon, I'm not
surprised one bit.

38:26.905 --> 38:27.904
When's he getting here?

38:27.973 --> 38:29.572
He'll be here at 7:00.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.408
What time is it?

38:31.476 --> 38:32.942
Nilly, you look pretty.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.110
Thank you.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.413
But I want you to put
on your red chucks.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.148
(laughing)

38:38.216 --> 38:40.850
Nilsa, for whatever reason,
is getting super dressed up

38:40.919 --> 38:43.019
to prove to Josh that apparently
she's over him, but...

38:43.088 --> 38:44.421
part of me feels like
she's getting dressed up

38:44.489 --> 38:47.390
just to show off and try to get
Josh to chase her even more.

38:47.459 --> 38:50.493
Oh, dressed nice for Josh,
I see. That's beautiful.

38:50.562 --> 38:54.097
Are you jealous?
Ohh, Gus-Gus, you're jealous!

38:54.166 --> 38:56.833
Everybody,
Gus-Gus is jealous!

38:56.902 --> 38:58.401
(laughing)
Gus is jealous!

38:58.470 --> 38:59.903
Oh, we already know!

38:59.971 --> 39:00.937
Y'all are hysterical.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.005
(Aimee laughing)

39:02.074 --> 39:03.907
He is so salty.

39:03.975 --> 39:06.609
I can't wait till
Josh gets here.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.244
Oh, I'm so excited
to see him.
Golly, whose day is it

39:08.313 --> 39:11.014
to wash dishes?
Kortni's!

39:11.083 --> 39:13.650
Damn!
Hey, Candace,
but the bitch loved me.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.819
(knocking on door)

39:22.794 --> 39:23.760
What's up, Carey?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.161
(laughing)

39:25.230 --> 39:26.996
Hey, Carey!

39:27.065 --> 39:28.298
We were just
talking about you.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.400
I will give Kortni credit.
She did find a man

39:30.469 --> 39:32.402
that was completely
opposite of Logan.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.970
This dude, for instance,
has his own car

39:34.039 --> 39:35.572
instead of a long board.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.974
(Nilsa)
You guys, be safe, have fun!

39:38.043 --> 39:39.509
I have snacks and condoms

39:39.578 --> 39:41.077
waiting for you
when you get home.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.112
Great, Mom.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.613
(Carey)
We'll see you all at La Vela.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.515
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, kids.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.284
Um, I do a lot of things
you wouldn't do.

39:48.353 --> 39:49.652
Look on the bright
side now.

39:49.721 --> 39:50.687
The next person
rings the door

39:50.756 --> 39:52.589
or knocks on it
has gotta be Josh.

39:52.657 --> 39:54.157
Thank God!

39:57.095 --> 39:58.862
Over.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.263
Damn.

40:00.332 --> 40:02.298
She has a "point to prove,"
so I say under.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.567
(Gus)
Sounds good till
you start drinking.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.536
(laughing)

40:06.605 --> 40:08.371
I'm not gonna
be able to do this.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.775
I don't really know how I'm
gonna feel whenever Josh comes.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.843
I could wanna
give him the Perdido Special.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.913
Or I could wanna hunch him.
I don't know.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.382
At one point,
I did have feelings for him.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.117
And I don't want any of those
to come back up.

40:25.157 --> 40:27.690
All I could think is
I really miss Candace because

40:27.759 --> 40:30.059
I feel like if
she was still to be here,

40:30.128 --> 40:32.061
she would be one more person
on my side

40:32.130 --> 40:34.998
to put Josh in his place if he
wants to act crazy towards me.

40:36.368 --> 40:37.667
Come downstairs
with me.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.469
(Aimee)
No, I wanna change
to my black dress.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.805
(whispers)
Oh, I'm not going down
there by myself.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.807
If Aimee wasn't here,
I would not be able

40:43.875 --> 40:46.009
to make it through this night
with Josh coming.

40:48.380 --> 40:53.116
Ah, well, well.
Yeow!

40:53.185 --> 40:55.051
(exhales and mutters)

40:57.656 --> 40:58.588
(man)
Next time on
"Floribama Shore"...

40:58.657 --> 41:00.056
Boy, oh, boy!

41:00.125 --> 41:01.858
I'm not gonna let Josh
come and get the best of me.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.693
I bet that I'm going
to smash tonight.

41:03.762 --> 41:06.930
Don't get hung up on whether
or not her nose is broken.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.298
They could put you in jail.

41:11.303 --> 41:13.136
Forget the fact that we're
leaving tomorrow.

41:13.205 --> 41:16.206
I feel like now's the time
to have fun on our last day.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.207
(woman)
They're naked!

41:17.275 --> 41:18.708
(man)
Naked!
