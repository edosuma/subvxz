[male #1]
'Stay calm.'

00:44.914 --> 00:48.135
Do that,
nothing can go wrong. Got it?

00:48.178 --> 00:49.745
Yeah, we got it.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.317
Hi, good to see you again.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.101
Uh, yes,
that time of the year.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.277
I have
to get my shoes resoled.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.452
Uh, put, put.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.541
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:03.585 --> 01:06.675
Right there.
Got just a...a hole there.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.898
[indistinct conversations]

01:15.423 --> 01:18.078
Everybody, get down!
This is a robbery!

01:18.121 --> 01:19.601
Get down from behind
the counter.

01:19.644 --> 01:22.038
Get down here! Now!

01:22.082 --> 01:23.561
Get down!

01:23.605 --> 01:25.085
- Down!
- Oh.

01:25.128 --> 01:27.957
Get down!
Get down on the ground!

01:28.000 --> 01:29.915
Nobody do anything stupid!

01:29.959 --> 01:31.352
Cameras. Move.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.918
'I wanna see
cell phones kicked'

01:32.962 --> 01:35.138
into the center
of the room right now.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.313
Let's see 'em!

01:37.706 --> 01:38.837
[hisses]

01:40.491 --> 01:42.450
- Name.
- Still Jane.

01:49.631 --> 01:52.112
Thank you.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.984
And, uh, how long
do you think that'll be?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.421
We'll see.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.162
Okay.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.946
Good to see you, too.

02:05.864 --> 02:07.866
Everybody's gonna
go home to their families

02:07.910 --> 02:10.782
if they don't do
anything stupid.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.176
Who here can open the vault?

02:13.220 --> 02:14.699
I can. I can.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.832
Get up! Get in the back!

02:18.094 --> 02:19.443
Get the bags.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.490
[instrumental music]

02:30.802 --> 02:32.064
Go!

02:37.157 --> 02:38.114
Open it.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.468
Hey. Kill it.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.268
Here. Fill it.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.185
[instrumental music]

03:23.333 --> 03:24.465
Fill it.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.864
[music continues]

03:37.391 --> 03:39.088
What's taking them so long?

03:47.444 --> 03:49.054
Get on your knees.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.667
Count to a hundred.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.104
One..

03:55.147 --> 03:56.671
'...two..'

03:56.714 --> 03:58.325
'...three..'

04:01.328 --> 04:02.459
[gunshot]

04:02.503 --> 04:05.114
What the hell was that?

04:05.157 --> 04:07.203
[intense music]

04:19.128 --> 04:20.434
Let's go!

04:22.958 --> 04:23.959
Back off. Come on.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.397
[gunshots]

04:27.441 --> 04:29.965
Go, let's go.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.490
[upbeat music]

04:35.666 --> 04:37.407
[tire screeching]

04:40.454 --> 04:42.630
[female #1]
'Hey, you idiot.
You hit my car.'

04:44.066 --> 04:45.372
There's a cop.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.116
[tires screeching]

04:55.382 --> 04:56.687
Whoa.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.168
Oh.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.517
Oh, I think
you need a little lie down.

05:00.561 --> 05:01.562
Just have
a little rest here.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.128
I think I'm going to faint.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.913
There we go.
Just put your head down.

05:04.956 --> 05:07.045
[theme music]

05:15.097 --> 05:16.577
[police radio chatter]

05:18.100 --> 05:20.450
Okay. Thanks.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.844
Three men hit the vault in
the back for a million in cash.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.585
The shot killed
an assistant manager.

05:24.628 --> 05:25.847
Any witnesses?

05:25.890 --> 05:27.501
Lots, but
they're not much help.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.024
The robbers
were wearing masks.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.982
They also blacked out
the cameras with spray paint

05:31.026 --> 05:32.201
but I'm pulling the footage.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.203
- Where's Jane?
- Inside.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.467
[Nancy crying]

05:37.511 --> 05:38.642
Is that
a friend of the victim?

05:38.686 --> 05:41.079
Fiancee. Works in the bank.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.441
Hey!

05:56.312 --> 05:58.836
Nice shoes.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.274
Uh, yes, uh, loaners.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.407
Mine are in
getting repaired.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.278
How long is that gonna take?

06:06.322 --> 06:09.804
We'll see.
The, uh...cobbler fainted.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.288
[police radio chatter]

06:19.988 --> 06:21.424
Are you coming?

06:21.468 --> 06:22.556
Eh.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.211
It's a little cramped in there.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.217
[instrumental music]

06:55.458 --> 06:58.156
No expended casings
in here. Any outside?

06:58.200 --> 07:00.420
Found two. Both 9-millimeter.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.291
Witnesses say
six shots were fired outside

07:02.334 --> 07:04.467
so one of the shooters
must've been using a revolver.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.860
Let me know what the ME says

07:05.903 --> 07:07.644
when he pulls the
slug from the victim.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.994
- You got anything?
- Maybe.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.387
I just spoke
with a Sac PD detective

07:11.431 --> 07:13.041
who thinks
this robbery's connected

07:13.084 --> 07:14.825
'with three others committed
in the past six months.'

07:14.869 --> 07:17.262
'In all of them, two,
sometimes three masked men'

07:17.306 --> 07:19.830
took out the security cameras,
passed up the teller drawers

07:19.874 --> 07:21.919
and went straight for
the vault, just like these guys.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.530
How many victims
in the other robberies?

07:23.573 --> 07:25.140
None. He's the first.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.715
Did the Sac PD finish
their search of the bank?

07:34.758 --> 07:36.934
Almost. Nothing so far.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.283
Okay. Here's
how we're gonna run this.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.024
You coordinate
the witness interviews

07:40.068 --> 07:42.723
and tell Rigsby to pull the case
files from the other robberies.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.725
I wanna know
if this is the same guys.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.509
[cellphone rings]
This is Lisbon.

07:46.553 --> 07:50.644
Cho. Was the safe deposit
vault open when you got here?

07:50.687 --> 07:53.473
- Yeah. Why?
- Just curious.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.779
Yes, sir.
I will be right there.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.564
That was
Bertram. I gotta go.

07:59.566 --> 08:03.352
Bank robberies belong
to the FBI. This case is ours.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.093
And tell me, why
does the CBI continue

08:05.136 --> 08:06.442
to encroach
on our jurisdiction?

08:06.486 --> 08:07.965
We were on site first.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.967
It's not our fault
if you're late off the mark.

08:10.011 --> 08:12.317
Agent Lisbon,
Agent Mancini has a valid point

08:12.361 --> 08:13.971
'regarding jurisdiction.'

08:14.015 --> 08:16.321
Sir, the crime my team
and I are investigating

08:16.365 --> 08:17.888
is the crime of murder.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.673
A murder committed
during a bank robbery.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.502
The murder supersedes
the crime of armed robbery.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.939
So our
investigation takes priority.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.723
You're more than
welcome to investigate

08:26.767 --> 08:27.811
after we close the murder.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.552
[scoffs]
Assuming you do.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.206
You know what they say about
assuming things. It makes--

08:31.249 --> 08:33.774
Alright. That's enough.

08:37.691 --> 08:40.258
Agent Mancini, Agent Lisbon
and her team will take point

08:40.302 --> 08:41.782
in the murder investigation.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.261
In the meantime, you will have

08:43.305 --> 08:45.699
full access to all case files.

08:45.742 --> 08:46.961
Agreed?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.534
Hey. We have a personal problem?

08:54.577 --> 08:55.709
Personal problem?

08:55.752 --> 08:57.101
You act like
you don't like me

08:57.145 --> 08:58.799
like I killed
your pet tortoise or something.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.496
What, are we in high school?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.020
You lost the most
important witness we've ever had

09:03.064 --> 09:05.588
in the Red John case and now you
wonder why I won't make nice?

09:05.632 --> 09:06.937
I didn't lose Lorelei Martins.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.678
And I want her back
just as badly as you do.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.767
And generally
speaking, when people act like

09:10.811 --> 09:12.943
they don't like me,
it's because they really do.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.466
They just
don't want to admit it.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.120
Yeah. No.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.601
I don't like you.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.951
You'll have the case files
by the end of the day.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.823
Listen, there's this
poker game we got going on.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.520
It's a friendly game,
mostly law enforcement

09:24.564 --> 09:25.782
state department, FBI.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.350
- You want in?
- Maybe. When?

09:28.393 --> 09:30.221
I'll call you
with the details.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.919
Good luck with the case.
Hope you find your man.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.268
Alright.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.793
You boys leave tonight.
Don't come back.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.274
I don't want
to see you again. Understood?

09:44.061 --> 09:46.498
[instrumental music]

09:47.456 --> 09:48.805
[tire screeching]

09:53.505 --> 09:55.682
Well, that was
a complete waste of time.

09:55.725 --> 09:59.120
Not one security camera near
Sac Federal caught the robbery.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.295
- Thanks.
- Sure.

10:00.338 --> 10:01.688
What's all this?

10:01.731 --> 10:03.777
Case files and footage
from the other robberies.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.300
Check this out.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.737
The Sac Fed job was
by far the largest haul.

10:07.781 --> 10:09.609
More than double
any of the other robberies.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.654
- They're getting ambitious.
- Not they. He.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.787
Now in each one
of the robberies there's maybe

10:13.830 --> 10:15.658
30 seconds of footage before
the cameras were blacked out.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.138
That was enough to analyze

10:17.181 --> 10:18.661
the suspects
height, weight, build

10:18.705 --> 10:20.358
and skin color, so I did.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.621
And guess what.

10:21.664 --> 10:22.796
Only one of
the robbers was involved

10:22.839 --> 10:25.189
in all four crimes.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.800
That's him.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.193
So the other robbers,
they were work for hire?

10:29.237 --> 10:31.152
Exactly. They do one job
and then they disappear.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.370
But if we can find this guy

10:32.414 --> 10:34.372
we find them all, he's the key.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.070
Do you remember anything
about the men who did this?

10:36.113 --> 10:37.941
No. Not a thing.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.117
You know Ernie and I were
up for the same promotion?

10:40.161 --> 10:42.076
I was mad
when I didn't get it.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.339
But not now.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.775
That could've
been me in there.

10:45.819 --> 10:49.126
[crying]
Ernie was a good man.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.520
He didn't deserve this.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.522
What were you doing
during the robbery?

10:53.565 --> 10:55.350
What they told me to.

10:55.393 --> 10:58.614
I am not trying
to get shot over this job.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.312
Ernie must've done
something wrong. Poor fool.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.793
And that's when the robbers
ordered you to the ground?

11:03.837 --> 11:06.187
Yeah. He stuck a
gun right in my face.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.364
I was gonna grab it
and take those guys down

11:09.407 --> 11:11.061
but I just had back surgery

11:11.105 --> 11:15.152
so, I didn't want to risk
the loss of innocent lives.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.937
After that,
one of the robbers

11:16.980 --> 11:20.505
took assistant manager
Ernie Wright into the vault.

11:20.549 --> 11:23.421
I think so. I don't
really know. I was in the back.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.075
During the robbery?

11:25.119 --> 11:26.120
In the men's room.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.774
Is this really necessary?

11:27.817 --> 11:29.819
You were in the
men's room the whole time?

11:29.863 --> 11:31.429
Yes.

11:31.473 --> 11:35.346
I was, uh, washing up
when I heard the gunshot.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.088
Of course, I didn't know
it was a gunshot at the time.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.655
It wasn't until
I stepped into the hall

11:39.699 --> 11:41.526
that I heard the screaming.

11:41.570 --> 11:42.963
Was anyone
back there with you?

11:43.006 --> 11:44.704
Not that I saw.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.271
[Nancy]
'Ernie and I had lunch plans.'

11:47.315 --> 11:48.664
We were just about to leave

11:48.708 --> 11:52.146
when I went into
the back to use the restroom.

11:52.189 --> 11:55.149
Yes, we saw as much
on the security footage.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.717
We also saw
your manager, Armin Gagnon

11:57.760 --> 12:00.067
heading into
the men's room just behind you.

12:00.110 --> 12:03.157
- Do you remember seeing him?
- No.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.942
Not until
after I heard the shot.

12:05.986 --> 12:09.816
I opened the door,
and Armin was standing there.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.427
Then I heard the robbers
shouting, so I closed the door

12:12.470 --> 12:15.735
and I-I hid in
the stall until they left.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.520
Mr. Gagnon was in the hallway?

12:18.563 --> 12:21.044
- Here?
- Yes.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.567
Why?

12:22.611 --> 12:25.048
Just trying to get
the facts straight, ma'am.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.834
Was Ernie
the type to fight back?

12:27.877 --> 12:29.618
No.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.664
Ernie was a big teddy bear.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.798
He'd never fight unless it was
to protect someone he loved.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.501
Hey. How's it going?

12:43.545 --> 12:45.895
- I think I got it.
- Okay. Lay it on me.

12:45.939 --> 12:49.072
This ringleader he had to have
planned the robberies, right?

12:49.116 --> 12:50.378
Right.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.032
Which means
he probably visited

12:52.075 --> 12:53.598
each of the banks
before he robbed them.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.818
On camera
and without a mask, yeah.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.646
So we run
all the security footage

12:57.689 --> 12:59.735
through facial recognition
software, and when we find

12:59.779 --> 13:01.998
the man that visited all four
banks before the robberies

13:02.042 --> 13:03.043
we find our ringleader.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.174
Great idea.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.915
It's an idea.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.656
I don't
know if I'd call it great.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.353
Ah, he's just jealous.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.313
What are you wearing?

13:12.356 --> 13:14.141
Oh, these things?

13:14.184 --> 13:16.839
Ah, they're loaners.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.275
How about this?

13:18.319 --> 13:20.364
Whoever figures out
the bank robber's name first

13:20.408 --> 13:22.062
wins lunch for a week.

13:22.105 --> 13:25.065
Yeah, that
usually doesn't end well for us.

13:25.108 --> 13:27.197
What do you say, Grace?
You feeling lucky?

13:28.329 --> 13:29.504
You're on.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.506
Yeah.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.684
[instrumental music]

13:35.727 --> 13:38.861
- 'It was closed.'
- You're certain?

13:38.905 --> 13:40.776
Must've been closed.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.909
The safe deposit vault
is always closed.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.783
I think it was closed.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.785
Yeah.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.396
I want you
to close your eyes.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.963
Hey, we're
grown-ups. Come on.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.839
Now put your mental self
back in this very spot

13:59.882 --> 14:02.929
in that very moment.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.583
I want you to hear
the sound that your shoes made

14:05.627 --> 14:07.803
on this marble floor.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.197
Now without
opening your eyes

14:10.240 --> 14:13.200
I want you to picture
the door as you pass by.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.942
Can you do that?

14:15.985 --> 14:18.161
Can you see the door?

14:18.205 --> 14:19.510
- Yes.
- And?

14:21.164 --> 14:22.992
- It was open.
- A-ha.

14:24.124 --> 14:27.040
Which means someone

14:27.083 --> 14:30.478
went inside the safe deposit
vault during the robbery.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.088
Mostly likely a robber

14:32.132 --> 14:34.308
trying to take
something from a deposit box.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.266
Oh, my. What if they did?

14:36.310 --> 14:37.789
Let's find out, shall we?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.530
- That's impossible.
- It is?

14:39.574 --> 14:42.098
The safe deposit boxes
are legal property

14:42.142 --> 14:43.883
of the
individuals who rent them.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.059
We don't even have
keys. Only the owners do.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.278
Only the owners do.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.498
You wouldn't happen to have a
list of those names, would you?

14:52.108 --> 14:53.327
We got a match.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.937
Oh, good morning to you, too.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.287
The suspect visited
Pacific Bank of Modesto

14:57.331 --> 14:59.855
and Fresno Savings and Loan
a week before each was robbed.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.291
'He comes in,
cases the place'

15:01.335 --> 15:02.858
then leaves
without making a transaction.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.339
- I think we found our guy.
- His name anyway.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.645
Well, congratulations.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.343
Me, too.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.084
You did? When?

15:11.127 --> 15:13.129
When did you figure it out?

15:13.173 --> 15:14.391
About an hour ago.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.002
Ah, well, there you have it.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.829
I figured it out two hours ago

15:17.873 --> 15:21.137
so it looks like I win the bet.

15:21.181 --> 15:22.443
Okay, what's his name?

15:22.486 --> 15:23.574
Oh, I'm not gonna fall

15:23.618 --> 15:25.881
for that old trick, Grace.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.230
Write it down
on a piece of paper

15:27.274 --> 15:29.624
so I know
that you're not lying.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.235
[instrumental music]

15:33.758 --> 15:35.108
[music continues]

15:41.418 --> 15:43.594
John Hutten.

15:45.509 --> 15:48.382
- How did you do that?
- How did I do it?

15:48.425 --> 15:50.297
Does it matter? I did it.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.995
Rigsby, we got a work address
on the suspect. Let's go.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.519
- Yeah.
- Uh, by the way, Grace.

15:55.563 --> 15:59.306
There's a fabulous
Thai place on sixth street.

15:59.349 --> 16:02.396
They make
a delicious Tom Kha Gai.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.006
Ooh. Can't wait.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.534
[train horn blaring]

16:30.685 --> 16:32.382
[machine whirring]

16:39.476 --> 16:41.000
Mr. Hutten?

16:45.613 --> 16:47.354
John Hutten?

16:49.747 --> 16:52.620
Put it down.
Let me see your hands.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.056
I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.189
I just want to ask
you a few questions.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.727
Agent Lisbon, you said?

17:14.772 --> 17:16.339
Pleasure to meet you.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.654
John William Hutten.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.830
You were arrested
twice for grand theft auto.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.180
You served
18 months in Folsom.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.529
Here you are.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.966
A suspect in a
robbery and homicide.

17:35.010 --> 17:38.013
Is there a charge
at the end of this, detective?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.884
Where were you
yesterday at noon?

17:41.147 --> 17:43.627
Home. Sick.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.803
Is there anyone
who can verify that?

17:47.153 --> 17:49.329
No, because
I was home, sick.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.113
Oh.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.462
You were caught on camera

17:52.506 --> 17:55.117
at four banks
in the Central Valley.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.814
All four of
those banks were robbed

17:56.858 --> 17:58.468
within weeks of you visiting.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.557
Which is
conclusive evidence of what?

18:00.601 --> 18:02.646
I think it's
evidence that your client

18:02.690 --> 18:04.344
planned to
commit armed robbery.

18:04.387 --> 18:08.652
Then charge him, and we'll
see what a jury has to say.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.611
What were you
doing in those banks?

18:12.656 --> 18:13.962
Times are tight.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.051
I was shopping
for competitive interest rates

18:16.095 --> 18:17.792
in money market accounts.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.535
And you've been smart so far.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.277
Blacking out security cameras,
going straight for the vault.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.410
But this time, you screwed up,
and somebody ended up dead.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.847
Maybe the Sac Fed job
was too big for you.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.981
O-or maybe the murder was
a part of the plan all along.

18:33.024 --> 18:36.027
I didn't rob
Sacramento Federal.

18:36.071 --> 18:38.160
'I didn't rob any bank.'

18:38.204 --> 18:41.076
But if I did, I certainly
wouldn't need to kill someone.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.686
That's just sloppy.

18:45.211 --> 18:48.301
Now, I've had
my brushes with the law

18:48.344 --> 18:50.651
but I've learned
some things from them.

18:50.694 --> 18:55.177
Like the fact that you can't
use my past against me in court

18:55.221 --> 19:00.008
and no matter what you
say inside this little room

19:00.051 --> 19:02.402
you have nothing on me.

19:02.445 --> 19:05.405
So unless there's
something else, Agent Lisbon

19:05.448 --> 19:08.495
I think I should be
getting back to work.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.061
We'll see ourselves out.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.590
[instrumental music]

19:17.678 --> 19:19.245
[Patrick]
'Hello.'

19:19.288 --> 19:21.986
Patrick Jane. I'm working
the robbery-murder case.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.640
We already spoke
with Agent Lisbon.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.207
Yes, I know.
I saw the whole thing.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.687
Uh, just a heads-up,
for future reference

19:26.730 --> 19:29.690
that large mirror
is, in fact, a window.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.562
What do you want?

19:32.606 --> 19:33.955
Uh, I can see
that you're a professional

19:33.998 --> 19:36.523
but, uh,
Agent Lisbon was correct, uh.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.481
This last
robbery was a break in pattern.

19:38.525 --> 19:42.485
Uh, I don't mean that just
because someone was killed.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.879
I'm talking
about the entire job.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.228
How's that?

19:46.272 --> 19:48.143
Well, the other
three robberies were simple.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.233
Small town banks,
very little security.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.582
Straightforward.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.106
But Sac Federal, bigger.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.282
Much bigger.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.153
Mr. Jane,
we've already answered--

19:58.197 --> 19:59.589
Now there had to be something

19:59.633 --> 20:01.722
that gave you
that extra bit of confidence

20:01.765 --> 20:03.593
to pull this one off.

20:03.637 --> 20:04.942
What was that?

20:04.986 --> 20:08.163
John, don't say a word.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.166
You had an inside man.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.343
Yes.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.606
Of course. I should've known.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.261
I used to use one
on occasion in my stage act.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.610
[elevator bell dings]

20:22.917 --> 20:24.614
- Stage act, huh?
- Mm.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.877
Uh, let me guess.
Balloon sculpting?

20:26.921 --> 20:28.096
Animal impressions?

20:28.139 --> 20:29.750
- Mm.
- That's it.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.971
John's a good worker.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.713
Shows up on time,
keeps his mouth shut.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.367
Does he hang out
with any of his coworkers?

20:38.411 --> 20:40.761
Not that I've noticed.
Keeps to himself mostly.

20:40.804 --> 20:43.154
Has he been
acting strange recently?

20:43.198 --> 20:44.721
Do anything
out of the ordinary?

20:44.765 --> 20:46.854
Like come in in a dress?

20:48.769 --> 20:51.250
No. Nothing like that.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.512
Can you confirm
whether or not Hutten

20:52.555 --> 20:54.209
was at
work on these dates?

20:56.037 --> 20:57.517
I can't help you.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.997
These are all before
John started working here.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.565
The last few days,
Hutten called in sick?

21:02.609 --> 21:05.264
Yeah, he said he had some kind
of bug. Couldn't get out of bed.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.613
Do you believe him?

21:06.656 --> 21:08.615
Sure. Why wouldn't I?
It's been going around.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.094
What do you mean by that?

21:10.138 --> 21:12.314
Two of my other guys
got the same thing.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.620
Arroyo brothers.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.709
Jorge, Cesar.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.148
We're gonna need
their home address.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.323
[instrumental music]

21:25.240 --> 21:28.069
When are you
getting your shoes back?

21:28.112 --> 21:29.853
They're not
so bad, are they?

21:48.524 --> 21:52.006
Are you sure this is
the right place to do this?

21:52.049 --> 21:54.182
Well, Hutten's
inside man works at the bank

21:54.225 --> 21:58.752
and it seems...everyone
that works at the bank is here.

21:58.795 --> 21:59.883
I'll be right back.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.494
Jane, wait.
What?

22:03.931 --> 22:05.149
Hello.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.021
Hello.

22:07.064 --> 22:09.197
Were you friends
with my grandson?

22:11.504 --> 22:13.462
Perfect. Glad you're all here.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.029
Quick. What's
your favorite color?

22:15.072 --> 22:16.247
- What?
- Favorite color.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.772
- Red? Green? Blue?
- Blue.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.252
Out of all your employees,
which is the least trustworthy?

22:21.296 --> 22:23.298
What? None of them.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.387
- You. What's your name?
- Casey.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.128
Casey, you work in banking

22:27.171 --> 22:28.999
yet your personal
finances are a wreck.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.479
- No, they're not.
- Oh, please.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.612
That handbag
on your salary? Dead giveaway.

22:32.655 --> 22:35.266
And you bite your nails.
Sure sign of anxiety.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.485
Yet someone as anxious as you

22:36.529 --> 22:37.704
probably doesn't
have the stomach

22:37.747 --> 22:39.923
to pull off
a crime like this.

22:39.967 --> 22:42.709
Crime? What crime?

22:42.752 --> 22:44.885
You didn't
like Ernie, did you?

22:44.928 --> 22:47.017
You felt threatened by him.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.324
- Who told you that?
- You did just now.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.413
Clearly not smart enough
to pull off a robbery.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.415
- What'd you say to me?
- You heard me.

22:53.459 --> 22:57.245
Uh, when I asked your manager
who he trusted the least..

22:57.288 --> 22:59.421
...his eyes darted to you.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.031
- They did not.
- Repeat after me.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.772
"I am the inside man."

23:02.816 --> 23:04.426
Hell, no.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.036
Just as I thought.
Not you either.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.126
Wait. Th-there
was an inside man?

23:09.170 --> 23:10.606
- What's your name?
- Uh, Tai.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.043
Tai. Pleasure to meet you.

23:13.087 --> 23:16.090
Have we met? Did you help rob
Sacramento Federal Bank?

23:16.133 --> 23:17.831
- No.
- You sure?

23:17.874 --> 23:18.919
- Yeah.
- Yes?

23:18.962 --> 23:20.790
- No?
- No. Get off me.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.314
[Casey]
'This-this is
completely inappropriate.'

23:23.358 --> 23:25.404
Show Ernie some respect.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.405
Ernie..

23:28.276 --> 23:29.799
Yes, Ernie.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.019
Absolutely right.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.150
My apologies.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.682
[indistinct chatter]

23:44.248 --> 23:46.729
That was 1982?

23:46.773 --> 23:48.470
Yeah.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.211
Jane. Jane, where you going?

23:50.254 --> 23:52.561
I just have to check on
something. I'll be right back.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.215
You know, you
should probably answer that.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.870
- It's very important.
- Damn it. Jane.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.437
- Hello?
- 'Hey, boss.'

23:58.480 --> 24:00.743
We checked out
the Arroyo brothers apartment.

24:00.787 --> 24:01.918
Place is empty.

24:01.962 --> 24:02.963
According
to the building manager

24:03.006 --> 24:04.268
they took off
late last night.

24:04.312 --> 24:05.835
Any word
on where they were going?

24:05.879 --> 24:07.489
No forwarding address
but they told the manager

24:07.533 --> 24:09.578
they were headed
to Mexico to visit family.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.841
And we also tracked down the van
that was used in the robbery.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.496
It was torched pretty bad.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.890
Yeah, it doesn't look like we're
gonna get anything form it.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.805
Alright, flag the
Arroyo brothers with customs.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.459
If they're
on their way to Mexico

24:20.502 --> 24:22.461
maybe we can get them before
they cross the border.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.679
Alright.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.684
[instrumental music]

25:07.984 --> 25:09.508
[paper rustles]

25:10.857 --> 25:13.294
[music continues]

25:16.645 --> 25:18.212
[paper rustling]

25:27.874 --> 25:30.920
Uh, Lisbon...found something.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.662
You will never believe who was
working with the bank robbers.

25:35.490 --> 25:36.970
Ernie Wright.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.105
Probably
shouldn't discuss it here.

25:48.068 --> 25:50.113
We're very sorry for your loss.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.903
There's no way Ernie
could do something like this.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.426
There's just no way.

25:58.469 --> 26:01.429
We found a one-way ticket
to Brazil in Ernie's name.

26:01.472 --> 26:02.735
No.

26:02.778 --> 26:05.389
No. That's absurd.

26:05.433 --> 26:06.869
Ernie?

26:06.913 --> 26:09.219
Robbing a bank?
I mean, he wasn't the type.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.004
He was exactly the type.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.617
Judging from
these photographs here.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.228
I'd say Ernie
became a different man.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.621
Yeah, he lost weight

26:19.665 --> 26:22.363
started dressing sharper.

26:22.406 --> 26:23.930
Powerful external
transformations

26:23.973 --> 26:28.064
can often coincide
with even larger internal ones.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.718
He was trying
to better himself.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.807
Why? Because of you?

26:31.851 --> 26:34.114
I encouraged him, of course.

26:34.157 --> 26:36.116
I loved him.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.597
Ernie was just
a teller when we met.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.816
He was still living at home.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.210
Shy, inexperienced with women?

26:43.253 --> 26:44.515
Yes.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.126
And what changed?

26:46.169 --> 26:48.607
He finished
his degree, got promoted

26:48.650 --> 26:50.783
to assistant manager
and bought this house.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.872
And you were by his
side every step of the way.

26:52.915 --> 26:55.309
You must have seen something
very special in Ernie.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.006
Yes.

26:57.050 --> 27:00.793
I saw that he was sweet
and how good a man he was.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.492
He could never
do something like this.

27:04.535 --> 27:05.711
No way.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.150
Where'd you grow up?

27:10.193 --> 27:11.717
Upstate New York.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.066
A town called Newburgh.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.329
Hmm. And you two?

27:15.372 --> 27:16.678
Uh, Chicago.

27:18.898 --> 27:22.031
Here. In Sacramento. Why?

27:22.075 --> 27:24.860
No reason.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.862
So if we prove
Hutten's connection to Ernie

27:26.906 --> 27:28.342
we prove Hutten's guilt.

27:28.385 --> 27:30.561
But a connection
should've come up by now.

27:30.605 --> 27:32.259
How did Hutten know Ernie?

27:32.302 --> 27:34.087
- Hot reading.
- What?

27:34.130 --> 27:36.393
Well, Hutten's a careful,
meticulous professional.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.699
He wouldn't have
used an inside man

27:37.743 --> 27:39.309
that could be
traced back to him.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.181
So he researched
the staff at the bank.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.574
Hot reading.
Very easy to do these days.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.447
And he kept digging until he
found someone with shaky ethics

27:46.490 --> 27:48.928
and a yen
for a better life. Ernie.

27:48.971 --> 27:49.929
Hmm.

27:53.454 --> 27:54.977
Wow. It's late.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.197
What are you
still doing here?

27:57.240 --> 28:00.548
Trying to find a connection
between Hutten and Ernie Wright.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.855
I've checked
Ernie's e-mail account

28:02.898 --> 28:05.074
text messages,
and cell phone records.

28:05.118 --> 28:08.034
Nothing. So far there's no sign
of communication between them.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.644
Mm. Sorry to hear it.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.646
Oh, listen, uh,
the bank manager's supposed

28:11.690 --> 28:13.779
to send out a list
of safety deposit box owners.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.389
Right. It's on my desk.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.086
Thank you very much.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.132
Silly me. Almost forgot.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.438
I've really been
craving Italian lately

28:21.482 --> 28:23.614
so what do you say
we get a nice linguine

28:23.658 --> 28:26.139
for lunch tomorrow?

28:26.182 --> 28:27.575
- Huh?
- Yeah. Okay.

28:27.618 --> 28:28.750
- Ciao. Ciao.
- Mm-hmm.

28:28.794 --> 28:29.969
[sugar packet rustles]

28:31.231 --> 28:33.799
[instrumental music]

28:57.953 --> 29:00.390
Jane. Jane, wake up.

29:00.434 --> 29:03.219
- Yeah. What's the time?
- Eight.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.569
- Oh, we have to get going.
- Where?

29:05.613 --> 29:07.746
I'll explain
it all in the car.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.486
No. You'll
explain it now, please.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.315
Oh, I like it when you get
all authoritarian on me.

29:12.359 --> 29:13.882
Talk. Where are we going?

29:13.926 --> 29:15.318
To catch Ernie's killer.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.146
How? We don't
have anything on Hutten.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.713
Hutten didn't kill Ernie.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.888
He didn't?

29:19.932 --> 29:21.107
Well, he robbed
the bank, alright

29:21.150 --> 29:22.456
but he was telling the truth

29:22.499 --> 29:24.110
when he said he didn't
need to shoot anyone.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.895
Why would he do that?
It's sloppy, not his style.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.898
Jane, I need more than that.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.334
You remember
the safe deposit vault

29:31.378 --> 29:33.423
was open during the robbery?

29:33.467 --> 29:36.078
I just assumed that someone
took something from there

29:36.122 --> 29:37.819
but, uh,
I got it all backwards.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.821
They didn't take anything.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.997
They put something in there.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.477
What?

29:43.520 --> 29:44.608
You really want
me to tell you?

29:44.652 --> 29:46.088
It's gonna ruin the surprise.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.873
Yes. I don't like surprises.

29:47.916 --> 29:50.745
Three guesses then.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.834
I'll give you a hint.

29:52.878 --> 29:56.577
It's, it's
not animal, or vegetable.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.494
[instrumental music]

30:01.625 --> 30:04.019
[sighs]

30:04.063 --> 30:07.718
You know, we can't open a safe
deposit box without a warrant.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.764
We can if we have
the owner's permission.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.857
Uh, we don't open
for a half-hour.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.381
- Is everything alright?
- Everything's fine.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.296
We just want to ask
your employees some questions.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.341
It shouldn't take long.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.559
Can you have everyone who was

30:22.603 --> 30:24.213
here at the time of the robbery

30:24.257 --> 30:26.999
gather in the safe deposit
vault, yourself included?

30:27.042 --> 30:28.522
Yes, absolutely.

30:28.565 --> 30:29.740
Has there been
a break in the case?

30:29.784 --> 30:31.003
You'll see.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.447
What's this all about?

30:40.490 --> 30:43.232
Oh, I've gathered you here
to help catch Ernie's killer.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.234
How are we gonna
catch the bank robber?

30:45.278 --> 30:47.584
Well, the bank robber
didn't kill Ernie.

30:47.628 --> 30:48.629
Then who did?

30:48.672 --> 30:50.413
Uh, one of you.

30:50.457 --> 30:52.328
- What?
- I don't think so, buddy.

30:52.372 --> 30:53.721
I would never--

30:53.764 --> 30:56.202
Whoa. There's
no need for objections.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.160
One of you shot Ernie
during the robbery

30:58.204 --> 31:00.423
and you hid the gun
in a safe deposit box.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.208
- I am sure of it.
- But that--

31:02.251 --> 31:04.471
Yes, exactly, Doug,
that means the killer would've

31:04.514 --> 31:06.690
had to have planned the murder
a long way in advance.

31:06.734 --> 31:09.955
So one of you,
who I will identify shortly

31:09.998 --> 31:13.088
is a cold-blooded schemer.

31:13.132 --> 31:14.960
Now, first of all
if there's anyone here

31:15.003 --> 31:17.484
that feels
the urge to leave feel free.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.573
Please do so.
But know this.

31:19.616 --> 31:22.315
We will assume
you are our killer.

31:22.358 --> 31:25.535
Armin, if you wouldn't mind
unlocking the vault door.

31:27.581 --> 31:28.625
[Patrick]
'Thank you.'

31:41.987 --> 31:46.339
Before we begin, uh,
Agent Lisbon has a few words.

31:46.382 --> 31:47.906
Agent Lisbon?

31:47.949 --> 31:50.343
I've been authorized by
the district attorney's office

31:50.386 --> 31:53.389
'to offer
Ernie's killer a plea deal.'

31:53.433 --> 31:54.956
Ten years in prison

31:55.000 --> 31:58.264
if you cooperate now
and open the deposit box.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.614
[Patrick]
'Ten years.'

32:00.657 --> 32:02.355
That's a very generous offer.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.357
And all you have to do

32:04.400 --> 32:06.925
is open the box
before I'm forced to.

32:11.581 --> 32:12.800
Just as I'd hoped.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.163
Here.

32:29.686 --> 32:32.820
Definitely somewhere here.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.778
- You sure?
- Positive.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.653
The offer is now 15 years.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.350
Alright, this is absurd.

32:41.394 --> 32:43.787
You can't play some
game with people's lives.

32:43.831 --> 32:46.355
Armin, we're the law.
We can do whatever we want.

32:46.399 --> 32:48.053
Any takers for 15 years?

32:50.055 --> 32:51.404
Very well.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.928
Mm.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.845
Mm, not really feeling it.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.719
Ah. Yes.

33:02.763 --> 33:04.852
It's somewhere
in this group here.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.290
The offer is now 20 years.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.727
[Patrick]
'20 years right now.
There it is.'

33:10.771 --> 33:13.992
Your last chance of seeing
freedom in your lifetime.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.864
All you need is a little key
that fits in a little lock.

33:19.649 --> 33:22.043
Suit yourselves.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.523
I believe..

33:25.264 --> 33:27.875
...it's one
of these three, here.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.923
Starting on five.
Starting on five.

33:32.967 --> 33:38.059
Uh, Stephens, Hudson, Keene.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.498
Stephens. Hudson. Keene.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.065
25 years.

33:44.109 --> 33:47.199
If we have to force open
the box, the deal's off.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.852
'You'll be
facing first-degree murder'

33:48.896 --> 33:50.332
'and the district attorney'

33:50.376 --> 33:52.117
'will aggressively
pursue the death penalty.'

33:52.160 --> 33:54.336
You might get life
if you're lucky.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.427
Alright, Jane.
Which one is it?

33:58.471 --> 34:01.082
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Stephens.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.345
[Patrick]
'No. No.'

34:04.303 --> 34:05.347
[inhales deeply]

34:06.914 --> 34:08.481
Keene?

34:08.524 --> 34:10.483
No, I don't think so.

34:11.919 --> 34:14.182
- Perhaps it's Hudson.
- Wait.

34:21.624 --> 34:24.062
- Nancy?
- I knew it.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.455
Oh, my God.
You evil bitch!

34:26.499 --> 34:29.067
Oh, there's no need for that.
Let's see if the key fits.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.546
Shall we?

34:34.289 --> 34:35.943
[clears throat]

34:41.601 --> 34:43.037
[Patrick]
'Mm-hmm.'

34:46.475 --> 34:48.477
[Laveria gasps]

34:48.521 --> 34:50.044
Nancy Sterling,
you're under arrest

34:50.088 --> 34:51.654
for the murder
of Ernie Wright.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.830
Turn around. Put your
hands behind your back.

34:57.530 --> 35:00.185
When I met Ernie,
he was a loser.

35:00.228 --> 35:03.840
Fat, stuck in his job,
still living with his parents.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.583
And you helped him change?

35:07.627 --> 35:11.370
Helped him?
I made him the man he was.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.850
'I supported him
when he went back to school'

35:13.894 --> 35:15.374
'found him his house'

35:15.417 --> 35:17.463
I even helped
him get promoted.

35:17.506 --> 35:19.552
And how did he repay me?

35:19.595 --> 35:22.250
He completely
lost interest in me.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.122
And you resented him for it.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.340
You're damn right I did.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.953
I thought
he was cheating on me.

35:29.997 --> 35:33.827
He was getting in shape,
working out.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.221
Don't think I didn't notice
other women looking at him.

35:37.483 --> 35:39.876
You should've seen Ernie.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.183
He loved it.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.707
Is that when you
began spying on him?

35:44.751 --> 35:48.363
I checked
his phone, his e-mail.

35:48.407 --> 35:52.062
One time I followed him into
one of those internet cafes.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.456
So shady.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.284
He was using
a secret e-mail account.

35:56.328 --> 35:58.199
Which you hacked into.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.896
That's when
I found the e-mails.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.115
And you're referring
to the correspondence

36:01.159 --> 36:02.899
between Ernie
and John Hutten, right?

36:02.943 --> 36:05.075
More like
step-by-step details

36:05.119 --> 36:07.165
outlining how they
were gonna rob the bank.

36:09.341 --> 36:12.300
I didn't know what to do.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.694
But then I found
that ticket to Brazil.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.915
Ernie was gonna leave me.

36:18.959 --> 36:22.180
Me,after everything
I'd done for him.

36:23.572 --> 36:24.965
I don't think so.

36:27.097 --> 36:30.013
I had
the details for the robbery.

36:30.057 --> 36:33.191
I knew exactly where
everyone was going to be

36:33.234 --> 36:35.236
and when they were
going to be there.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.328
So I hid.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.852
And I waited
for the robbers to leave.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.380
Then went into the cash vault.

36:50.469 --> 36:52.384
Ernie never
suspected a thing.

36:53.994 --> 36:55.691
I'm keeping the ring.

36:55.735 --> 36:56.866
What are you..

36:58.825 --> 37:00.000
[gunshot]

37:03.046 --> 37:05.266
You should've
seen the look on his face.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.791
It was perfect.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.837
Except for one thing.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.409
I left the
safe deposit vault door open.

37:22.762 --> 37:26.113
When I tried
to go back and close it

37:26.156 --> 37:28.028
it was too late.

37:29.986 --> 37:31.336
[exhales deeply]

37:33.076 --> 37:36.166
You know, you could've
just called the police.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.429
Turned Ernie in.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.300
I thought about that.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.520
I really did.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.566
But Ernie was gonna leave me.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.655
Me.

37:46.699 --> 37:48.570
I was planning our wedding

37:48.614 --> 37:51.269
and he was just
gonna disappear forever.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.315
Unh-unh.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.491
He deserved everything he got.

38:03.977 --> 38:06.501
This is getting to be grounds
for harassment, Agent Lisbon.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.851
I told him
this wouldn't take long.

38:08.895 --> 38:12.072
"I will arrive Tuesday
at 12:00 p.m. exactly.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.291
"You will be in the lobby.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.467
"I will take
you in back at gunpoint

38:15.510 --> 38:18.165
'"where you
will open the vault.'

38:18.208 --> 38:20.776
"You will help load
the cash into duffel bags

38:20.820 --> 38:22.735
then you will stay behind."

38:25.738 --> 38:28.131
Ernie's fiancee
was spying on him.

38:28.175 --> 38:30.308
Text messages, phone calls,
she even found the secret

38:30.351 --> 38:32.048
e-mail account
that he was using.

38:32.092 --> 38:36.357
As a matter of fact, she saved
every e-mail you sent him.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.185
You ready to talk
about that deal now?

38:40.361 --> 38:42.102
Hutten wasn't the killer

38:42.145 --> 38:46.367
so it had to be somebody else
in the bank, but why Nancy?

38:46.411 --> 38:47.760
Whoever killed
Ernie had to have known

38:47.803 --> 38:49.239
about the robbery in advance.

38:49.283 --> 38:52.112
Nancy was, uh,
the likely candidate.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.114
She's also
a classic power dater.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.551
- A what?
- Oh, you know the type.

38:58.466 --> 39:02.078
They date down so they have all
the power in a relationship.

39:02.122 --> 39:04.298
Oh. And how did you know this?

39:06.648 --> 39:11.392
Uh, well, she had more than half
of the space in Ernie's closet.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.699
I mean, she didn't even live
there and she had more than

39:13.742 --> 39:16.092
half of his closet space?

39:16.136 --> 39:18.921
And how did you know which
safe deposit box was Nancy's?

39:18.965 --> 39:20.532
I hot read her.

39:20.575 --> 39:23.143
I had the list of owners
and the bank staff files.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.754
I knew one of the names
had to be Nancy in disguise.

39:25.798 --> 39:28.757
- Hudson?
- Mm.

39:28.801 --> 39:32.195
No one ever strays very far
when it comes to false names.

39:32.239 --> 39:33.632
Nancy said that she grew up

39:33.675 --> 39:35.373
in a small town
in upstate New York.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.592
- Newburgh.
- On the Hudson river.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.420
On the Hudson river.

39:39.464 --> 39:42.380
You know, these shoes are
actually quite comfortable.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.598
They're growing on me.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.168
- Not on me.
- No?

39:56.481 --> 39:57.656
[inhales and exhales deeply]

39:58.961 --> 40:01.834
Hey, Teresa.
Glad you made it.

40:01.877 --> 40:04.750
It's a pretty high-class crowd.
I wish you would've warned me.

40:04.793 --> 40:08.188
Nah. They're pussycats.
Come on. I'll introduce you.

40:08.231 --> 40:11.452
Teresa Lisbon, this is
District Attorney Don Wolcott.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.020
FBI Bureau Director
Charles Bailey.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.544
- Senator Eileen Dawkins.
- State senator.

40:16.588 --> 40:18.459
Here. Have a seat.
Get you a drink?

40:18.503 --> 40:20.461
Yeah. Can I have a scotch
on the rocks, please?

40:20.505 --> 40:22.332
You got it.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.030
Oh, I think
you know this guy, right?

40:24.073 --> 40:26.815
Teresa.

40:26.859 --> 40:28.817
I didn't take
you for a gambler.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.690
Oh, it's not gambling
if you know you're gonna win.

40:31.733 --> 40:35.563
Whew! Well, we got
a live one. Watch out.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.480
[instrumental music]

40:42.918 --> 40:44.964
Look at that, huh?
Beautiful work.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.400
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.059
Okay. Here.

40:55.496 --> 40:57.019
There we go.

41:03.678 --> 41:05.071
For the rental.

41:05.114 --> 41:07.508
[laughs]

41:07.552 --> 41:10.511
Thank you. Goodnight,
Mr. Jane. Goodnight.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.121
Goodnight, Niko.

41:14.515 --> 41:15.908
I'm headed home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:15.951 --> 41:19.389
Uh, yeah, tomorrow,
curry, definitely.

41:19.433 --> 41:21.653
I feel like some Indian.

41:21.696 --> 41:24.046
You gotta tell me. How did
you come up with Hutten's name?

41:24.090 --> 41:25.483
It's driving me crazy.

41:27.267 --> 41:30.313
Fair enough.
Get a pen and some paper.

41:30.357 --> 41:32.054
Write down a name, any name.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.807
Wayne Rigsby.

41:47.592 --> 41:49.245
- You guessed?
- No.

41:49.289 --> 41:51.465
Although with that
name, it wouldn't be hard to.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.076
I, uh, read your pen.

41:54.120 --> 41:57.210
- So you cheated?
- That's a dirty word.

41:57.253 --> 41:58.690
Maybe just a little.

42:03.129 --> 42:04.957
Here's what I
think of your little trick.

42:07.655 --> 42:09.178
I didn't quite
get the first word

42:09.222 --> 42:12.399
but the second word
was definitely "you."

42:12.442 --> 42:13.966
Goodnight.

42:23.671 --> 42:25.630
Oh, well,
that's not very nice.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.252
