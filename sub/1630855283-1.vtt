00:59.929 --> 01:01.452
-  You cryin', Dad?

01:01.626 --> 01:03.454
Guess what time it is.
It's cake time!

01:03.628 --> 01:05.848
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.155
Louise, you look beautiful.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

01:08.329 --> 01:09.504
You look beautiful.

01:09.678 --> 01:12.333
I never seal the envelope

01:12.507 --> 01:15.118
until I see what kind
of party is thrown.

01:16.641 --> 01:20.036
It's all in here.
I love youse both. Mwah!

01:20.210 --> 01:24.954
Louise, I know you think
I hate you. I don't. I love you,

01:25.128 --> 01:27.087
and I was right
about that dress.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.220
Sebastian, you better be
good to her because
she's my ride or die.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.701
- I swear. She seriously--
- Yeah. You better
treat her right.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.833
Yeah, treat her right,
'cause if not, I'm gonna beat
the fuck out of you.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.880
Say hi to Aunt Louise!
Hi, Aunt Louise.

01:38.054 --> 01:41.884
Congratulations from all of us
in the Russo family.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.190
-  Whoo!
- Right?

01:43.364 --> 01:44.669
- <i>Salute</i>, eh?
- Yeah.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.236
- <i>Salute</i>!
- <i>Salute</i> !

01:46.410 --> 01:47.759
Love it, Dad.
Short and sweet.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.500
Oh, go. Go say what you want.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.415
Oh, Oh, okay.

01:51.589 --> 01:52.851
This is gonna be good, boys.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.377
- Okay. Uh...
- Give it to me.

01:56.551 --> 01:59.597
Uh, God bless from me
and Leo and Sticks.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.426
We love you both.
Okay, who's next? Ro, talk.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.428
Me? No. What the hell
am I gonna say? Here.

02:04.602 --> 02:07.736
Oh, not Sticks. Kid hasn't made
a sound since his baptism.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.564
Gotta be an asshole
on the wedding video.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.263
Sticks, gonna make a man
out of you.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.309
No, no, no,
he's already a man.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.181
Relax, Leo.

02:18.355 --> 02:19.791
I am relaxed.
I'm just saying...

02:19.965 --> 02:22.403
- All right, give me the thing.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.840
- No. I got somethin'.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.929
Uh, Sebastian and Louise...

02:27.103 --> 02:28.800
- Uh, I guess...
-  Put down the wine.
That's enough.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.933
- Who got my fork?
- Oh, here. Take mine, Dad.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.630
- I got one.
- That's my fork.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.546
The best advice
I could give to you is, uh,

02:35.720 --> 02:38.158
don't hurt each other, you know?

02:38.332 --> 02:40.072
- If you can avoid it.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.336
- And, uh...
- Can you please
move over, please?

02:42.510 --> 02:43.859
- Thank you.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.295
- Oh.
- Get him a glass.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.908
So God bless. God bless to you,
and God bless the children

02:50.082 --> 02:52.868
that you're gonna make
for all of America.

02:54.783 --> 02:55.871
Yeah. Okay.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.134
That was different.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.528
Hey, hey, hey.
H-hold-- hold on, hold on.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.964
Yeah, listen. Um...

03:02.138 --> 03:03.574
You want us to edit you out?

03:05.315 --> 03:07.752
- Yeah, edit me out.
- Okay.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.667
-  You're like a freakin'
12-year-old.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.147
You're 12 years old.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.912
- No cheesy things?
- I'm concentrating here.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.218
No cheesy things.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.222
Five o'clock today, okay?
Don't forget.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.703
- Be ready.
- Yeah, yeah. Aren't you late?

04:28.877 --> 04:29.921
Nah.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.228
Oh, shit.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.622
No more parking tickets.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.015
Five o'clock,
please, Ange. Serious.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.495
Costing us a fortune.

04:41.890 --> 04:42.934
Fuck me.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.030
The fuck is this?

04:54.468 --> 04:56.774
You know, I've been friends
with him my whole life.

04:56.948 --> 05:00.865
Can't remember him running,
even when we were kids.

05:01.039 --> 05:03.085
Looks like
he shit his pants, no?

05:03.259 --> 05:05.130
No parking in this neighborhood.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.743
I'm like a mile away.
Are they here?

05:08.917 --> 05:11.267
Nah, I think they're bidding
on that Jackson Heights job.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.269
Oh, right. Right.
Good, good.

05:13.443 --> 05:16.185
I got to leave early, so they
don't need to know I'm late.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.534
You know me.
I don't know nothin'.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.058
- Huh.
- Hey, Leo! Hey,

05:20.232 --> 05:22.713
you think you can get
one of your guys to come
look at my bathroom today?

05:22.887 --> 05:24.367
My damn tub is leaking.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.413
Oh. Yeah, okay.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.632
- Sure, we'll get in there.
- Oh, thank you.

05:28.806 --> 05:31.896
Hey, if you hear some groaning,
it's just this old lady
tryin' to yoga.

05:32.070 --> 05:34.072
-  Bye.
-  Huh.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.467
Kind of hope she groans, right?

05:37.641 --> 05:39.600
I was thinking the same shit.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.520
How'd it go, Dad?

05:46.694 --> 05:49.261
How did it go?
Frank gave him a price.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.568
They're gonna ask for lower.
You know, we'll see.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.092
Yeah. Oh, uh,
the lady, uh, Pamela,

05:54.266 --> 05:56.921
she said her tub's leaking,
so I told her
we'd get in there--

05:57.095 --> 05:58.706
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Leo, come on.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.273
You don't promise the client
anything until I speak...

06:01.448 --> 06:02.753
I didn't promise anything.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.712
Forget it. Let's go take a look.
Come on.

06:07.192 --> 06:09.934
The gate, guys, it needs
to be primed and painted.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.719
Nobody's going home
until it's done.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.721
Okay, but you know
I got to leave early, right?

06:13.895 --> 06:16.332
- 'Cause I got Sticks' game.
- You better get to it, then.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.987
I'll check out
the tub thing, Pops.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.077
Your little brother's
turning into a real dick.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.948
Yeah, you know,
got a lot of pressure.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.124
Foreman and all,
it's a lot of stress.

06:26.298 --> 06:29.389
Irregardless, glad I used
to beat the shit out of him.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.786
These are so nice.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.398
They do a good job
at that Versailles.

06:38.572 --> 06:41.052
The Viennese hour was late.
That pissed me off.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.967
- It was fine.

06:43.141 --> 06:46.188
And the chocolate fountain
was spinning all lopsided.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.756
I think that's how it's supposed
to look when it spins.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.279
It was all beautiful, Connie.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.586
So beautiful.
Louise looked gorgeous.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.239
Oh, they look so nice together.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.111
Where'd they go again
for the honeymoon?

06:56.285 --> 06:58.069
Anguilla.
Am I saying that right?

06:58.243 --> 07:00.724
Oh, that's nice.
That's tropical, right?

07:00.898 --> 07:03.118
I don't know what it is,
but they'd better
get pregnant there.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.034
What? I got nothing to do now.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.776
She's out of the house.
Let's go. Gimme a baby.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.908
I put a bottle of wine
in her luggage

07:11.082 --> 07:13.433
- because wine always helps.
- That's funny.

07:13.607 --> 07:17.306
When Phil's horny,
he gives me wine. He knows...

07:17.480 --> 07:18.699
I need wine.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.529
Of course you need it.
I can't fuck Lou without wine.

07:22.703 --> 07:25.401
- Oh, boy!
- Phil pours me wine

07:25.575 --> 07:27.490
and does this frickin'
English accent.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.971
-  No.
- Yeah.

07:30.145 --> 07:33.888
Thinks it's sexy.
Sounds Japanese. Swear to God.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.586
- How about Leo?

07:36.760 --> 07:39.241
Quiet ones are always
the biggest freaks, right, Ange?

07:41.199 --> 07:44.115
Little different
for us still.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.817
She lost weight--
Louise, right?

07:49.991 --> 07:51.601
That dress fit her so good.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.474
Yeah. Unfortunately, her nose

07:54.648 --> 07:56.563
becomes more prominent
with the weight loss,

07:56.737 --> 07:58.390
but you can't win 'em all.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.656
Okay, Dad, I'm gonna go.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.268
- And the gate?
- Done. Finished. Yeah, 100%.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.574
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.839
Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna go.
It's his last game tonight...

08:12.013 --> 08:14.450
unless they win.
Then they got the playoffs.

08:14.624 --> 08:15.669
Well, they're not
gonna win, though.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.279
They're playing the best team

08:17.453 --> 08:18.585
in the Tri-State area.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.064
Uh-huh.

08:20.238 --> 08:21.805
Yeah, it's too bad.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.504
Basketball's been good
for his confidence.

08:26.506 --> 08:30.466
You know, you, uh, you never
seen him out there, Dad.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.949
Maybe you should come, huh?
Get a chance to see him play.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.341
It's, uh...

08:37.647 --> 08:39.170
He's different out there.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.479
You just told me
he was gonna lose.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.700
Yeah, but that-- uh...

08:46.874 --> 08:48.658
- Tub's fixed.
- Come here, come here.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.792
I wanna show you something.
Look at this. Got a problem.

08:51.966 --> 08:54.055
Oh, my God.
You know how much problems
that's gonna give us?

08:54.229 --> 08:55.491
We gotta call
an engineer in here.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.101
- Exactly
- Look at this here.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.886
Because here, look...

08:59.060 --> 09:00.061
All right, see you Monday.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.584
...through the pantry...

09:04.413 --> 09:07.242
We are... Glendale!

09:07.416 --> 09:10.201
We are... Glendale!

09:10.375 --> 09:13.117
We are... Glendale!

09:13.291 --> 09:16.120
We are... Glendale!

09:16.294 --> 09:18.035
Principal Murphy!

09:18.209 --> 09:19.733
- Okay.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.691
Principal Murphy!

09:22.779 --> 09:24.302
Principal Murphy!

09:25.565 --> 09:26.696
Whoo!

09:26.870 --> 09:28.437
Don't make me run, Leo.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.004
Gonna miss the intros now.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.919
- Mr. Russo!
- Hey, Marshall.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.356
I saved you your regular seats.
It wasn't easy.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.358
Almost a full house tonight,
last game and all.

09:36.532 --> 09:37.794
Well, no,
not if we win, Marshall.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.274
True, but North Jersey's
ranked first

09:39.448 --> 09:40.841
- in the Tri-State area.
- Yeah.

09:41.015 --> 09:43.408
John Slaughter averages
31 points a game.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.933
Nice to see you, Mrs. Russo.
First time since the Great Neck
game in February.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.848
- Oh! Got to go!

09:48.065 --> 09:49.980
- Nothing gets by that kid, huh?
- No, he knows his stuff.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.460
I like him. Come on.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.288
<i>Put your hands together</i>

09:53.462 --> 09:56.160
for your starting lineup
for your Glendale Cougars!

09:58.902 --> 10:01.775
At guard,
junior Blake Corcoran!

10:05.692 --> 10:07.607
Oh, shit. They started
already. Come on.

10:11.915 --> 10:14.091
Come on, come on.
Up here. Here.

10:14.265 --> 10:17.878
- Don't push me.
- I'm not. Just get up there.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.010
Leo, give me some hope here.
Can we sneak a win?

10:20.184 --> 10:22.709
- Hey, why not, right?
- That's what I wanna hear.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.059
-  Come on. Right here.
-  And finally,

10:25.233 --> 10:28.192
at forward, standing
six foot, two inches...

10:28.366 --> 10:29.629
- Just made it.
- Calm down.

10:29.803 --> 10:30.978
Breathe or somethin'.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.763
...Matthew "Sticks" Russo!

10:39.726 --> 10:41.031
...Russo!

10:41.205 --> 10:43.947
Mister... Russo!

10:44.121 --> 10:46.428
Mister... Russo!

10:46.602 --> 10:49.039
Mister... Russo!

10:52.956 --> 10:54.958
How long have they
been doing that?

10:55.132 --> 10:57.178
Last three or four games.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.007
'Cause I'm here
all the time, I guess.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.662
- Weird, right?
- Yeah. I can see you hate it.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.631
I got him.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.243
Go, go!

11:20.070 --> 11:22.420
- Ohh! Ohh!
- Oh, man.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.557
- Cut, cut!
- Here you go, Sticks!

11:30.341 --> 11:31.778
- No!

11:33.867 --> 11:35.869
- Yeah!

11:36.826 --> 11:39.481
-  That's the shit, Leo!

11:43.050 --> 11:44.704
- Oh, no!

11:49.491 --> 11:50.797
- Ohh!

11:52.102 --> 11:55.323
Defense! Defense! Defense!

12:04.941 --> 12:06.726
- Ohh! Matty!
- Yeah!

12:06.900 --> 12:08.162
Go, go, go.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.733
- Let's go!
- Yes!

12:13.907 --> 12:16.213
That's halftime,
ladies and gentlemen.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.520
- Oh, my God!

12:23.699 --> 12:25.092
See you
in about 20 minutes.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.790
<i>♪ Who let the dogs out? ♪</i>

12:27.964 --> 12:29.531
<i>♪ Who, who, who, who, who ♪</i>

12:29.705 --> 12:31.359
<i>♪ Who let the dogs out? ♪</i>

12:31.533 --> 12:33.970
<i>- ♪ Who, who, who, who, who ♪</i>

12:34.144 --> 12:35.972
They know that's
20 years ago, right?

12:36.146 --> 12:39.019
I know. I told 'em we should use
"Ain't gonna be no rematch."

12:39.193 --> 12:41.804
- Huh?
- Um, the end of <i>Rocky</i>.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.502
Creed hugs him and says,
"Ain't gonna be no rematch."

12:44.676 --> 12:46.548
Rocky says, "Don't want one."

12:46.722 --> 12:48.376
That's 40 years ago.

12:48.550 --> 12:51.640
- Thank you.
-  Hey, Mr. Russo!

12:51.814 --> 12:52.946
You got to believe, Mr. Russo.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.948
I do, Ryan. I do.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.559
I don't know if that's Ryan.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.474
- Oh, shit.
- What?

12:59.648 --> 13:02.085
- Angela!
- Hi, Dorothy.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.565
Hi. I haven't seen you
in a while.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.133
Well, you know,
but last game, so...

13:06.307 --> 13:07.612
No, no, not if we win.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.310
Look at your hair.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.225
It came back wavy
like I told you.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.835
Yeah, yeah.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.055
That's my sister now, you know.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.578
Yeah, me too.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.623
Uh, two hot dogs
and a Sprite, please.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.235
Coming up. You look great.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.977
-  I'm leaving.
- What?

13:24.151 --> 13:26.718
Mm, she's gonna push
that support group shit on me.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.547
I'm tired of saying "no" to her.
Just tell her I had to pee.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.593
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, Leo.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.987
What are you feeding that kid?
We got a shot at this.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.553
Oh, that's-that's who he is,
you know?

13:35.727 --> 13:36.946
It's his mom who feeds him.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.601
Nah, you feed him. Leo.
It's you!

13:53.310 --> 13:55.312
Mom, I told you
I was going to a game.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.445
Yes, I did. You just never
listen to me. That's why.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.144
Okay, bye.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.409
- Oh, Mrs. R.
- Emory.

14:05.583 --> 14:09.283
- Our boy bangin' tonight, huh?
- Yeah, I guess he's bangin'.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.546
How's your mom? You being
a pain in the ass to her?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.591
Come on. Don't do that, Mrs. R.
You know I'm the best.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.942
- We should get back, right?
- Yeah, but look who's here.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.987
Oh, you broke up with Stephanie?

14:18.161 --> 14:20.250
Stephanie?
Wait a minute, Mrs. R.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.383
You don't know who this is?
You've never seen her.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.994
Yeah, I seen her
in the bathroom.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.300
- Oh, shit.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.650
Hey, this is Sticks' girl.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.173
- What?

14:30.521 --> 14:32.697
My boy don't even tell
his moms. Of course.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.179
Mrs. R., you're Mrs. Russo?
Oh, my God. Hi.

14:36.353 --> 14:37.920
- Hi.
- It's so nice to meet you.

14:38.094 --> 14:41.315
- Oh. Well, wait, my Sticks?
-  Yeah.

14:41.489 --> 14:44.622
It's so like him, right?
All quiet and weird.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.103
Mm. Yeah, yeah.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.062
You should see your face
right now, Mrs. R.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.368
- God, this shit is hysterical.
- Emory! Come on! Let's go!

14:51.542 --> 14:54.154
Hey, boo-boo!
Hey, I got to go, Mrs. R.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.112
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

14:56.286 --> 14:58.723
Um... okay.
Well, this was cool.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.595
- Yeah.
-  Bye.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.292
You too.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.687
Y'all,
I see you runnin', bro,
where my Skittles at?

15:05.861 --> 15:09.778
Hey, Ange. I'm looking all over
for you. Halftime's over.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.867
Matthew's got a girlfriend.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.790
-  Defense!

15:21.964 --> 15:23.574
Defense!

15:23.748 --> 15:27.796
Defense! Defense! Defense!

15:37.545 --> 15:39.199
Come on, come on.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.434
Yeah!

16:02.918 --> 16:04.180
-  Defense!
- I got ball! I got ball!

16:04.354 --> 16:05.616
Defense!

16:05.790 --> 16:07.879
Defense! Defense!

16:08.054 --> 16:09.838
- Defense! Defense!

16:10.012 --> 16:11.709
Stay on him, Sticks.
Stay on him.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.669
Defense! Defense!

16:18.151 --> 16:19.717
- No! No! No.
- No, no.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.246
- We can win this!
-  Come on, Glendale.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.379
I believe that we will win!

16:29.553 --> 16:33.340
I believe that we will win!
I believe that we will win!

16:33.514 --> 16:35.081
- I believe that we will win!
- Johnny, go.

17:19.821 --> 17:23.390
Good game, Glendale! Good game!

17:24.130 --> 17:25.957
Congratulations, North Jersey.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.569
You played a great game.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.962
- Well, that sucked.
-  Leo.

17:31.572 --> 17:35.315
Leo, I'm gonna make
this high-def for you, okay?

17:36.098 --> 17:37.795
I'll tell you what.
I'll bring it by the house.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.581
- Thanks, Scott.
- Yeah.

17:40.755 --> 17:41.756
That'll be nice
for Matthew to look at.

17:41.930 --> 17:42.931
Sure.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.065
Well, come on. We should be
down there when he comes out.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.153
Yeah.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.215
Ah, I should have worked
with him more on his jump shot.

18:06.389 --> 18:09.218
When? Since he's ten, you're in
the yard with him every second.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.699
- Yeah...
- Here he comes.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.701
Don't be all sad, okay?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.746
Let's be happy
for what he done.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.228
She go in the locker room
with him?

18:19.402 --> 18:21.274
All right, don't be mean
in front of her, Ange.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.579
She don't know us yet.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.974
Sticks, 22 points. Nice.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.671
Rather win.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.892
Yeah. Yeah, of course
we'd rather win. Yeah.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.636
Who's this, Sticks?

18:35.810 --> 18:38.378
Oh, this is Dani.
I mean, her name is Danielle.

18:38.552 --> 18:41.163
- But... yeah.
- Hi again.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.209
And I guess just a first "hi"
to you, Mr. Russo.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.950
- Yeah, hi. Hi.
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.171
Say something!

18:49.345 --> 18:52.131
Ow... but... uh,
you said "hi" already, so...

18:53.697 --> 18:55.177
Where you from, Danielle?

18:55.351 --> 18:57.484
- Uh, Forest Hills Gardens.
- Oh.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.313
Not the ritzy part.
We're mostly normal.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.837
Got the smallest house
on the block. Right, Matty?

19:03.011 --> 19:04.534
You been to her house.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.015
- Not in it, but you know, yeah.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.843
Oh, shit.
We got to go, Matty.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.758
I, uh, I got to drive her
to work.

19:11.019 --> 19:13.413
Oh, we were gonna go to Corona,
get some lemon ices, you know,

19:13.587 --> 19:15.371
celebrate everything.
You could come.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.548
Oh, that's so nice, um,
but my boss sucks if I'm late.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.246
He's an idiot, so...

19:20.420 --> 19:22.509
Told her I'd drive her,
so let's go.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.033
It was really nice
to finally meet you guys,

19:25.207 --> 19:27.601
no thanks to this one.
Bye.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.431
Wait. Come here.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.128
- Oh.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.043
- Okay, go.
- Oh, man.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.523
Come to dinner Sunday!

19:38.002 --> 19:39.874
- Ma, she don't--
- I would love to.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.180
I love Italian food.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.312
Okay, Sunday, twelve o'clock.

19:43.921 --> 19:47.534
Dinner at 12. I-I love it.
I'll be there. Thank you.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.058
Now take me to work, boy.
You want me to get fired?

19:50.232 --> 19:53.104
Wait! I'm slipping.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.932
-  Kind of heavy.
-  Hey!

19:55.106 --> 19:56.195
- Sorry.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.372
Do not fuckin' like her.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.376
How come we don't know
about her till now?

20:03.550 --> 20:05.465
- What? Who?
- The girl.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.728
Danielle, or Dani,
or whatever she calls herself.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.860
I don't know.
Come on. He's 18.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.211
He's doing a lot of things
we don't know about.

20:12.385 --> 20:15.605
Name one.
Name one thing that kid does
we don't know about.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.259
Well, how am I supposed
to name it

20:17.433 --> 20:19.000
- if we don't know about it?
- Open the car.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.915
You know, what's funny is
you worry about him

20:21.176 --> 20:22.960
'cause you never talk to nobody,
and now he's got a girlfriend,

20:23.134 --> 20:25.398
you're still worried.
So which is it?

20:25.572 --> 20:27.487
They're filling gaps, Ange.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.706
- What?
- Yeah, what-what Rocky said,

20:29.880 --> 20:31.534
- why he went out with Adrian.
-  Here we go.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.754
"I got gaps. She's got gaps."

20:33.928 --> 20:35.190
- Together they have gaps.
- "Together, we fill gaps."

20:35.364 --> 20:36.757
- Open the door.
- It's true.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.715
-  Excuse me!

20:38.976 --> 20:40.456
Yeah. How you doing? I'm sorry.
Front gate to get out of here?

20:40.630 --> 20:42.415
Yeah. No, up the hill
around there.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.287
Oh, thank you. Yeah.
I get lost in an elevator.

20:45.461 --> 20:46.984
- Huh.
- Hey, wait a second.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.117
You're, uh,
you're number 42's dad, right?

20:49.291 --> 20:52.947
- Huh?
- Uh... [chanting] Mr. Russo!

20:53.121 --> 20:54.949
- Yeah, that's me.
- Yeah. Hey, your kid--

20:55.123 --> 20:57.343
he had a good game.
Twenty-two points.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.563
Yeah. Yeah, 22 points.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.609
I mean, that's more than some
teams get against North Jersey.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.133
- Where's he going to college?
- Oh, well, no. He's--

21:05.307 --> 21:08.267
He's coming to work for us--
a family business, construction.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.877
Wait, wait,
you're-you're telling me

21:10.051 --> 21:11.270
he's not going anywhere
with game like that?

21:12.053 --> 21:13.272
Look, with all due respect,

21:13.446 --> 21:14.838
and this is none
of my business--

21:15.012 --> 21:16.797
That's right. It's not.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.278
Well, actually, it's--
it's exactly my business.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.628
- I'm a talent evaluator.
-  Hmm?

21:22.411 --> 21:24.674
- I'm a scout for Syracuse.
- Syracuse?

21:24.848 --> 21:26.720
Wait, wait. You-you think
that Sticks can--

21:26.894 --> 21:28.374
No, no, no. I'm sorry, look--
No, I'm here for Slaughter.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.898
Your son's
not going to Syracuse,

21:31.072 --> 21:32.595
but you're telling me
none of the smaller schools

21:32.769 --> 21:34.336
came sniffing around here
for your boy?

21:34.510 --> 21:37.121
- Sniff what?
-  This is the problem.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.516
See, no one's gonna hear about
a kid on the Glendale Cougars,

21:40.690 --> 21:42.475
and it's a shame,
'cause all the roster spots,

21:42.649 --> 21:44.520
they're probably filled up
by now, but...

21:45.869 --> 21:47.784
Look, if-if you want me
to make a few phone calls,

21:47.958 --> 21:49.917
there might be
a hole here or there.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.224
Some of those holes
have scholarships.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.667
Sounds like
he's full of shit, Leo.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.495
No, no, no, I mean, he got us
a meeting at the school,

22:02.669 --> 22:04.018
so he's not full of shit.

22:04.192 --> 22:06.063
Seemed a little
squirrelly to me.

22:06.237 --> 22:09.153
What he said made sense.
Why couldn't Sticks play, huh?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.547
We're eating in 20 minutes.
Do not fill up on this.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.157
If we can't eat it,
why are you bringing it out?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.768
'Cause Ma said bring it,
and if I don't bring it,

22:15.116 --> 22:16.683
she's gonna talk about it
for the next 15 days,

22:16.857 --> 22:18.293
and you don't got
to fucking live with her!

22:18.641 --> 22:19.729
Only one of us has to live
in this goddamn house!

22:22.079 --> 22:24.473
Look, I mean,
the kid's not gonna play
for the Knicks, right?

22:24.647 --> 22:26.432
- Nobody said that.
- Jesus Christ.

22:26.606 --> 22:27.955
These refs are killing me.

22:28.129 --> 22:29.043
What school
are we talking about?

22:29.217 --> 22:30.392
Drexel. It's in Philly.

22:30.566 --> 22:31.524
Sounds like an ice cream.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.308
Actually, that's Carvel.

22:33.482 --> 22:34.918
I'm joking, dummy.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.573
Oh.

22:37.747 --> 22:41.316
One of the recruits got
Lyme disease or somethin',
so we got lucky.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.231
Gonna lose a three-team parlay

22:43.405 --> 22:44.754
'cause of these
crooked-ass refs.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.669
So what happens, Leo?

22:46.843 --> 22:49.759
I mean, he screws around
at this, uh, ice cream school

22:49.933 --> 22:51.413
for-for-- for four years,

22:51.587 --> 22:53.197
then comes to work
for us anyway.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.025
Why waste all that time?

22:55.199 --> 22:57.245
Well, uh, maybe
he takes business,

22:57.419 --> 23:00.379
and he learns something
that helps Russo Construction.

23:01.205 --> 23:02.642
Like what?

23:02.903 --> 23:05.645
Stuff that you learn in school.
I don't know.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.864
- Something we don't know.
- We or you?

23:08.038 --> 23:10.301
'Cause we know all we need
to know about our business.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.999
That's why it works.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.828
I can't take it.
Cover your ears, boys.

23:15.002 --> 23:16.438
You're killing me!

23:16.612 --> 23:19.615
You cheating, game-fixing
son of a bitch!

23:21.965 --> 23:23.619
That wasn't even that bad,
Uncle Pete.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.055
Yeah. It's Sunday.
I left some shit out.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.886
So, is this like
a special occasion?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.671
Somebody's birthday
or something?

23:31.845 --> 23:33.629
No, just Sunday.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.370
And everybody comes?
Your whole family?

23:35.544 --> 23:36.980
Yeah, every Sunday.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.592
That's amazing.
My family... I don't know.

23:39.766 --> 23:42.943
They're just different,
I guess. I love this.
Okay, listen, though,

23:43.117 --> 23:45.424
if I start saying something
stupid or that's, like,
insulting or whatever,

23:45.598 --> 23:47.948
just give me a kick under
the table, and I'll shut up.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.689
I don't think you
can insult them.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.386
I don't know.
Sometimes I get a big mouth,

23:51.734 --> 23:54.258
and then I just start talking,
and I just... Hold on.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.828
Hey! Hey, pencil guy.
What's your name?

24:00.090 --> 24:02.223
- Wally.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.530
Relax! I'm talking to Wally.

24:04.704 --> 24:07.141
Hey, I still need to get
my taxes done.
I'm coming to you, all right?

24:07.315 --> 24:11.754
Wally!

24:11.928 --> 24:13.190
Sorry.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.541
People just ignore
those guys all day,

24:15.715 --> 24:17.586
so I just like to...
I don't know.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.416
I just like to say "hi"
so they don't feel invisible.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.724
You know?
God, I look like a crazy person.

24:24.898 --> 24:27.553
What is your family gonna think
when they see me like this?

24:28.423 --> 24:30.207
I don't really care
what they think.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.955
How come we haven't had sex yet?

24:44.221 --> 24:45.440
Um...

24:45.788 --> 24:47.529
It's not a bad thing.
It's just...

24:48.269 --> 24:50.619
What, three weeks? Right?

24:54.754 --> 24:57.278
Emory said don't tell you this.

25:00.934 --> 25:03.502
But I never tried
sleepin' with nobody.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.203
You knew that?

25:10.857 --> 25:11.858
Yeah.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.561
Take a right up here.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.868
Well, no,
my <i>nonna</i>'s house is--

25:22.129 --> 25:25.132
No, I know where it is.
Just take a right.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.923
Uh, this isn't gonna work
for us. Come on.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.973
- My legs are getting caught.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.421
I, um... I don't know
how funny this is.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.902
I think it's a little funny.

26:41.774 --> 26:43.340
You know, it's getting
kind of cold out here.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.997
Shit! Shit! Shit!

26:48.171 --> 26:51.740
Oh, shit! Get in, get in! Oh!

26:51.914 --> 26:53.873
- Shit.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.050
- Did he see you?
- I don't know.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.922
- Why would you do that?

27:00.096 --> 27:03.360
I swear, I've never seen
anybody walking through here.

27:03.534 --> 27:06.146
Sorry.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.111
So you've been here before?

27:20.160 --> 27:22.031
Not a lot, but...

27:23.424 --> 27:24.686
yeah, I've been here.

27:45.620 --> 27:49.232
Thank you, God,
for blessing us with this food,

27:49.406 --> 27:51.191
our health, our family.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.976
And, uh, thank you for, um,

27:54.150 --> 27:56.892
blessing us with the new company
we have today.

27:57.066 --> 28:01.723
In your name,
we will forgive her and Sticks
for being 25 minutes late.

28:01.897 --> 28:05.161
- And, uh, that's it. Amen.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.336
Amen.

28:06.510 --> 28:09.035
<i>Mangia. Tutti mangia.</i>

28:09.209 --> 28:13.039
-  All right.

28:13.213 --> 28:16.042
- Sauce-- put sauce on that.
- You gotta put the sauce on.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.305
Dani, how'd you meet
this little shithead over there?

28:18.479 --> 28:19.741
- Petey.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.091
I say it with affection.
He knows.

28:22.526 --> 28:25.747
Uh... [laughs] First time
was when Glendale came
and played over at Hillcrest.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.271
Danielle's from Forest Hills.

28:28.445 --> 28:30.360
Oh, yeah? We worked
on a house over there.

28:30.534 --> 28:31.840
Yeah, guy had a Maserati.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.060
Yeah, but it was yellow.
No, thanks.

28:34.234 --> 28:37.019
See, Sticks? Athletes--
they get all the girls.

28:37.193 --> 28:39.543
Actually, I-I didn't even know
Sticks played basketball.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.197
I just saw him
in the parking lot.

28:41.371 --> 28:44.026
Just saw him in the parking lot.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.725
- How about that?
- And then what?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.208
Uh, then I...
I just went over there,

28:52.382 --> 28:54.210
and I said,
"We should hang out."

28:54.384 --> 28:56.604
- You go to him?
- Yeah.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.519
-  Oh, no.
- What do you expect?

28:58.693 --> 29:00.782
You expect Harpo Marx over
there to talk to her first?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.612
No, no.

29:04.786 --> 29:07.006
Ma, relax. Women are allowed
to make the first move

29:07.180 --> 29:09.269
since, uh, 1971.

29:09.443 --> 29:10.705
What are you waiting
for then, Ro?

29:10.879 --> 29:12.620
Oh, you know what?
Fuck you, Frank.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.578
- Hey.
- You're breaking
Mom's heart over here.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.363
How about I stick my foot
right up your fucking asshole?

29:16.537 --> 29:18.452
- Enough! I'm telling
all of you now.
- Oh!

29:18.626 --> 29:20.541
I told-- I said
it's enough, didn't I?

29:22.151 --> 29:24.806
You know, with your mother
sitting right here.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.982
Show some respect, huh?

29:27.156 --> 29:29.115
- Sorry.
- All right.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.726
So, Dani,

29:31.987 --> 29:33.293
you graduate high school
next month too, right?

29:33.467 --> 29:34.903
- Yeah. I can't wait.
- Yeah.

29:35.077 --> 29:38.515
- Then college.
- Oh, God, no.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.780
A lot of things I want to do.
I'm gonna drive cross-country.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.217
Oh.

29:44.391 --> 29:45.392
For what?

29:46.915 --> 29:48.569
Um...

29:49.657 --> 29:52.355
How am I gonna change the world
if I don't see it all first?

29:55.750 --> 29:57.883
Man, I'm being weird.
You're supposed to kick me.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.145
You're not weird.

29:59.319 --> 30:00.755
Well, the thing is, I...

30:00.929 --> 30:02.975
I just want to figure it
all out, you know?

30:03.149 --> 30:05.716
What's my path? How am I
gonna make a difference?
And all that stuff.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.371
What do your mother and father
say about that?

30:08.545 --> 30:10.591
- They're pissed.
- I bet they are.

30:10.765 --> 30:12.549
Yeah, but they're full of it.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.247
They just-- They want me to go
to some Ivy League school

30:14.421 --> 30:16.379
so they can brag about it
to their friends.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.599
It's all about them.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.601
That's why I'm working
at that crappy diner,

30:20.775 --> 30:22.429
'cause I need to buy a car.

30:22.603 --> 30:23.909
My dad says he'll pay
for school and nothing else,

30:24.083 --> 30:25.867
which is stupid,

30:26.041 --> 30:27.869
'cause I would just end up
partying with a bunch of idiots

30:28.043 --> 30:29.871
who don't know what they
want to do yet either.

30:35.094 --> 30:37.183
- Any more meatballs?
- Oh!

30:37.357 --> 30:39.011
- I make some more.
- Oh, no, no, no. I--

30:39.185 --> 30:40.664
- Please. No, no, no--
- Too late.

30:40.839 --> 30:41.927
No, you did it. You did it.

30:42.101 --> 30:43.319
No, really, I have enough.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.234
Well, you're getting
more meatballs.

30:45.408 --> 30:46.888
- Everybody's gettin'
more meatballs.
- Yes.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.759
The neighbors
are getting meatballs.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.761
- Everybody. Yeah.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.067
Thank you.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.854
I like what this kid's saying.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.812
What, about the college?
Yeah, but I don't think--

30:57.986 --> 30:59.553
She's right.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.598
The kid's gonna end up
working for us anyway,

31:01.772 --> 31:03.426
making big money, right?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.385
L-let's get to it.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.952
Feels good making money,
right, boys?

31:07.126 --> 31:08.127
Bought a Mustang.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.042
Twenty-two years old,

31:10.216 --> 31:11.434
got his own Mustang.

31:12.696 --> 31:14.437
Listen to your
girlfriend, Sticks.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.787
Don't waste your time
with that meeting.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.877
Uh, no, no, no.
I-I didn't say that.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.269
That would be stupid.

31:27.755 --> 31:29.104
How's that?

31:29.452 --> 31:30.758
They're offering him
a scholarship, right?

31:31.019 --> 31:32.325
That's like 100 grand
in free money.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.328
Don't fool yourself, kiddo.

31:35.502 --> 31:38.897
Nothing is free
in this world, huh? Yeah.

31:39.071 --> 31:41.682
I mean, they-- they say
they're giving you the money,

31:41.856 --> 31:43.771
and then they, you know,
they schmuck you around with--

31:43.945 --> 31:45.860
Well, yeah,
but you don't know that yet.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.690
I mean, Mr. Russo,
you're a businessman.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.649
You know don't turn down
work before you talk
to the client, right?

31:52.823 --> 31:54.521
I mean, if you don't hear
their offer first,

31:54.695 --> 31:56.784
how do you know they're really
schmucking you around?

32:07.055 --> 32:09.188
I guess there's no harm
in lookin'.

32:13.975 --> 32:17.326
Sticks! You got
a little firecracker here.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.241
- Sticksy! Wow!

32:20.764 --> 32:21.896
- All right.
- Good boy.

32:23.550 --> 32:24.855
Where are the meatballs, Ma?

32:25.030 --> 32:27.684
- I'ma comin'. Shut up!

32:48.488 --> 32:51.056
<i>I can't find
this damn athletic center.</i>

32:52.100 --> 32:53.493
Got here pretty quick, huh?

32:53.667 --> 32:57.062
I mean, hour and 45,
door to door.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.152
Man, look at this.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.892
I never thought
there was anything,

33:02.067 --> 33:04.460
you know, beautiful in Philly.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.072
You need to turn down
the rah-rah. Okay?

33:07.246 --> 33:10.336
What? This is normal stuff
I'm saying.

33:10.510 --> 33:13.382
You called goats on the side
of the highway "majestical."

33:14.557 --> 33:16.516
- Well, that's not what I said.
- Mm.

33:16.777 --> 33:20.911
I said the sun that was
coming up behind the goats
was majestical.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.392
Goats were just, you know,
part of the majesty.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.438
Just turn it down.

33:25.612 --> 33:29.572
I'm excited. This could happen,
for Sticks. Right?

33:29.746 --> 33:32.314
I mean, who would have thought
this kid with this anxiety stuff

33:32.488 --> 33:34.099
and afraid of anything new...

33:34.273 --> 33:35.709
- Yeah.
- And here we are, right?

33:35.883 --> 33:37.537
I'm saying,
just let it be his choice,

33:37.711 --> 33:40.279
'cause that stuff
is still inside of him.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.107
And if we push him
into something he don't want,

33:42.281 --> 33:43.717
he starts feeling overwhelmed,

33:43.891 --> 33:45.588
that's gonna mess him up
even more.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.376
All right, you're right.
I'll tone it down.

33:52.726 --> 33:56.382
These trees, Sticks, huh?
They're everywhere.

33:57.774 --> 34:01.256
We're a small school, Matthew,
but it's full of good people.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.215
Really good people.

34:05.695 --> 34:06.870
Yeah, we seen that.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.481
My wife got lost,

34:08.829 --> 34:11.049
and some very nice people
gave us directions.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.702
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

34:14.661 --> 34:15.966
We call him "Sticks,"
by the way,

34:16.141 --> 34:18.143
'cause of the long legs.
Always had 'em.

34:18.317 --> 34:20.014
Yeah. Came out
of the chute that way.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.624
Just kept growing.

34:21.798 --> 34:22.886
Still growing.

34:24.932 --> 34:25.933
Six-three?

34:26.107 --> 34:27.239
Six-two.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.501
Okay.

34:30.329 --> 34:31.678
Still growing, though.

34:34.289 --> 34:37.292
All right, enough chit-chat.
Let's, uh, go take a look
at the gym.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.425
Oh, great.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.211
Really? Came outta my "chute"?

34:45.257 --> 34:46.475
Right in here.

34:47.215 --> 34:49.826
Mr. Parsons mentioned
a scholarship?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.567
A scholarship spot
has opened up,

34:51.741 --> 34:54.135
but there are six prospects
we're looking at.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.789
Well, seven now,
including Sticks.

34:56.964 --> 35:00.054
Well, uh, Mr. Parsons--
he didn't say
nothin' about that.

35:00.228 --> 35:02.230
No. Man's a scout.
He doesn't work here.

35:02.404 --> 35:04.014
- So he wouldn't know
about that.
- Right.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.625
He just knows talent
when he sees it.

35:06.887 --> 35:10.020
So in three weeks,
we try out all the recruits.

35:10.195 --> 35:14.155
And if Ben's right about Sticks'
talent here, and he usually is,

35:14.329 --> 35:17.115
then I think you've got
a pretty good chance.

35:19.073 --> 35:20.118
Here we are.

35:39.049 --> 35:41.443
Two thousand seats, huh?
You believe that?

35:41.617 --> 35:43.793
Yeah, believed it when you
told us eight hours ago, Leo.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.491
I tell you about the trees?

35:45.665 --> 35:47.580
Yeah, like a half-wit.
You told us about trees.

35:47.754 --> 35:50.539
Come on. Time to lock up, Leo.
I want to catch my bookie.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.150
Got to settle up
before the Knicks start.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.890
You go. I'm gonna lock up here.

35:54.239 --> 35:55.718
I want to finish this
so I don't hear Frank's shit.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.372
You sure?
I can wait a few minutes.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.200
No, no, I got it.
Give me the keys.

35:59.374 --> 36:01.681
- Okay, weirdo.
- Go lose your money.

36:01.855 --> 36:03.552
- I'll catch you tomorrow.
- Later, Leo.

36:19.699 --> 36:22.354
- Shh!
- Don't think he heard me.

36:23.442 --> 36:26.401
So... what else?
How are the dorms?

36:27.968 --> 36:30.579
They're far. Far away, you know?

36:30.753 --> 36:32.799
It's Philadelphia.
That's nothing.

36:33.713 --> 36:34.757
Yeah, I guess.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.891
- They got big guys there.
- Hm.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.459
I'm only, like,
average next to them.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.377
I don't hang out with average.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.168
- I wrote you somethin'.
- What do you mean?

36:55.387 --> 36:59.260
Nothing. Sometimes I just
think stuff, so I write it down.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.697
What, like a poem?

37:02.611 --> 37:05.571
Don't rhyme or nothing. Here.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.747
Uh-uh, you wrote it,
you read it.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.618
No, it-- it ain't that good
or anything.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.577
If I read it, you're really
gonna think it sucks.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.406
Like that would happen. Come on.
It's not the critic that counts.

37:14.580 --> 37:15.581
It's the man in the arena.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.932
Teddy Roosevelt.
Maybe it was the other one.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.412
I don't know.
One of the Roosevelts.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.327
But it's true.

37:22.501 --> 37:24.764

You are the brave one.

37:49.528 --> 37:51.486
to tell her how
she makes me feel.

37:51.660 --> 37:55.621
Words like 'happy' and 'strong',

37:57.100 --> 37:58.276
but better than that.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.931
Come on, brain.
Send some words down.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.456
But they don't come.

38:05.674 --> 38:07.633

It's, uh, my brother Frank--

38:41.884 --> 38:44.931
Ohh! I'm still sore
from today. Oh.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.718
You know, you're good.
You're really good.

38:50.632 --> 38:53.548
Yeah. Ed, he couldn't even
hang a friggin' picture.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.682
Yeah, he wasn't good at much.

38:59.424 --> 39:03.776
Although, you know, he was...
he was always there.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.560

39:37.766 --> 39:39.768
- Okay.
- All right.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.553
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:57.438 --> 39:58.613
Whoo.

40:01.703 --> 40:04.445
-  Hey!
- Hey. How was work?

40:04.619 --> 40:06.708
Normal, 100% normal.

40:10.582 --> 40:11.974
Yeah. So where is he?

40:12.148 --> 40:14.629
Oh, where you think?
What's her face?

40:14.803 --> 40:18.807
Oh, yeah? So, uh, what then?
Uh, we're alone?

40:18.981 --> 40:20.243
Yeah, we're alone.
What do you think?

40:20.418 --> 40:21.462
Somebody's
in the friggin' closet?

40:21.636 --> 40:22.855
What the hell does that mean?

40:24.509 --> 40:25.901
I'll put you in the closet, huh?

40:26.075 --> 40:28.904
- I'll get in there with you.
- Okay.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.950
Petey show your porn
on his phone again?

40:31.124 --> 40:33.169
- Mm. You're the porn.

40:33.343 --> 40:34.606
The mommy porn.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.564
- Ew, Leo.
- Yeah, that was stupid.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.001
I don't know why I said that.
Forget it. Erase that. Erase it.

40:39.175 --> 40:42.440
- Aw, I'm making cutlets.
- I think you forgot one.

40:43.745 --> 40:45.791
Oh. Still has a bone in it.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.054
Oh, shit, Ange
that's fuckin' porn talk.

40:48.228 --> 40:50.404
-  Come on.

40:50.578 --> 40:51.579
- Huh?

40:51.753 --> 40:53.320
- Oh, okay.
- Oh.

40:54.016 --> 40:57.019
Sticks-aroni! Hey!

40:57.193 --> 40:58.238
Home early. Good.

40:59.326 --> 41:00.980
What's going on, man?

41:01.894 --> 41:03.635
She broke up with me.

41:03.809 --> 41:06.246
Uh, what? Why?

41:08.074 --> 41:09.292
Wrote her a poem.

41:10.903 --> 41:12.470
Tell her what
she means to me.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.863
Means to you?
She don't mean nothing to you.

41:15.037 --> 41:17.344
- All right, Ange, please.
- And since when are you
writing fucking poems?

41:19.041 --> 41:20.173
I'm gonna go to bed.

41:21.087 --> 41:22.349
All right, hold on,
hold on. Listen.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.264
Your-your mom's hysterical here

41:24.525 --> 41:28.094
because she doesn't like seeing
you like this, getting hurt.

41:29.008 --> 41:31.097
Dani wants to see other people.
That's what she said.

41:31.271 --> 41:34.187
- I'm so surprised.
- Ange, stop it.

41:34.361 --> 41:36.319
Can I go to my room now?

41:37.364 --> 41:38.931
Yeah.

41:39.105 --> 41:40.759
Yeah, get some rest.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.804
Tomorrow we start getting
ready for the tryouts.

41:43.892 --> 41:46.765
A lot of exciting stuff
happening for you!

41:52.379 --> 41:54.250
Too bad.
She was all right.

41:54.424 --> 41:57.036
Full of piss and vinegar,
you know? But in a good way.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.386
Yeah, he'll be okay.

41:59.560 --> 42:02.128
I just got to get his mind
off it, you know?

42:02.302 --> 42:03.912
- Get him back on the court.
- Yeah.

42:04.826 --> 42:07.960
I remember my first girl,
Debbie Keaton.

42:08.134 --> 42:09.614
Nobody cares.

42:09.788 --> 42:11.267
I fucked her legs.

42:14.619 --> 42:17.665
Yeah, it was the first time
for both of us.

42:17.839 --> 42:20.625
I thought I was,
you know, in her vagina.

42:21.495 --> 42:24.237
Went home, told all my friends
I had sex and shit.

42:24.411 --> 42:27.196
Next day, she dropped
the bomb on me.

42:27.370 --> 42:28.676
I fucked her legs.

42:32.071 --> 42:33.376
Wish you hadn't told me that.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.813
That's what I said to her.

42:39.687 --> 42:41.950
- Motherfuckers.

42:42.124 --> 42:44.170
- What's going on?

42:44.344 --> 42:46.041
- Somebody broke in.
- Stole all the tools.

42:46.215 --> 42:49.349
Got my damn chop saw
and all my drills!

42:49.523 --> 42:51.264
- Motherfucker!

42:51.438 --> 42:53.266
Who locked up last night?

42:54.876 --> 42:56.748
Yeah. No, I did.

42:56.922 --> 42:58.750
Oh, you fucked it up.
Goddamn it.

42:58.924 --> 43:00.360
I could see it
all over your face, Leo.

43:00.534 --> 43:01.927
It's not on my face.
I'm not--

43:02.101 --> 43:03.319
I'm not doing anything
with my face.

43:03.493 --> 43:05.060
The lock ain't busted.

43:05.234 --> 43:07.106
Means it was left open.

43:08.629 --> 43:09.935
I think I locked it.

43:10.109 --> 43:11.980
You don't think!

43:12.154 --> 43:14.069
That's your problem, Leonard.

43:15.244 --> 43:16.637
I'll tell you one thing.

43:17.769 --> 43:21.163
I didn't work my whole life
building this company

43:21.337 --> 43:24.602
so you can just piss it away.

43:29.041 --> 43:30.869
All right? Come on.
Let's get back to work.

44:36.543 --> 44:38.110
Look what was left
in the mailbox.

44:38.284 --> 44:40.460
Last game highlights.
Brandon's dad.

44:41.374 --> 44:42.462
Wanna go watch?

44:44.464 --> 44:45.421
Nah.

44:49.469 --> 44:50.862
Sticks, remember, um...

44:52.472 --> 44:54.082
remember when Creed
breaks Rocky's nose?

44:54.256 --> 44:56.911
- I'm gonna shower.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

44:57.085 --> 45:01.002
Look, you-you--
you got to believe me, Sticks.

45:01.176 --> 45:04.484
I-I know how you feel,
but I also know...

45:06.225 --> 45:07.617
you're gonna get over it.

45:09.794 --> 45:10.795
How?

45:12.274 --> 45:15.713
You-- you just
keep going like Rocky.

45:15.887 --> 45:17.149
Huh? He broke his nose--

45:17.323 --> 45:18.977
No, no, Dad. No. It's...

45:21.588 --> 45:23.329
You said you know how I feel.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.332
How?

45:27.072 --> 45:29.074
You've been with Mom
since high school.

45:29.248 --> 45:30.379
No one--

45:35.384 --> 45:37.082
Dad, no one ever forgot
about you.

45:42.870 --> 45:44.089
I'm gonna shower, Dad.

46:41.233 --> 46:43.670
Well, you're gonna have
to pay me back for this, Mom.

46:43.844 --> 46:45.846
'Cause if you didn't say
I could use the car,
I would have taken the bus.

46:46.020 --> 46:48.283
Now I'm late.
I got to Uber or something.

46:48.457 --> 46:50.808
Getting highlights
is not an emergency!

46:50.982 --> 46:52.374

46:53.898 --> 46:55.508
Doesn't give one shit,
neither of them.

46:55.682 --> 46:57.553
Here's dinner.
I'll see you tonight.

46:57.902 --> 46:58.946
And when you're done,
turn the TV off
and finish your homework.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.208
- Right?
- Yeah.

47:03.342 --> 47:04.430
Hey, Dani.

47:10.479 --> 47:12.960
- Thanks for this.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

47:14.744 --> 47:16.921
Hey, listen, I-I guess
I came by to see...

47:18.966 --> 47:21.273
you know... if you're okay.

47:26.278 --> 47:28.802
Look, Mr. Russo, I-I didn't...

47:30.935 --> 47:34.373
Sticks is so sweet, and he--

47:34.547 --> 47:36.505
He was just getting
so into us, you know?

47:36.679 --> 47:40.335
And I mean we're only 18.
I... I don't...

47:42.511 --> 47:44.731
I-I'm leaving as soon
as I get a car, so I just...

47:46.298 --> 47:48.126
The last thing I ever
wanted to do was hurt him.

47:48.300 --> 47:49.867
I know that. I know.

47:51.216 --> 47:52.826
That's why
I wanted to ask you.

47:55.437 --> 47:58.484
Do you think that maybe
you could go back out with him?

47:59.833 --> 48:02.836
It'd only be for three weeks,
just until the tryouts.

48:03.010 --> 48:04.969
And you don't got to see him
that much 'cause you work

48:05.143 --> 48:06.840
and-and he's at practice.

48:07.014 --> 48:09.234
Uh, uh, Mr. Russo, uh...
I can't--

48:09.408 --> 48:11.540
Listen, listen, Dani,
I-I know this kid,

48:11.714 --> 48:14.717
and-and he is not gonna make
that team if he's sad like this.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.329
I understand that,
but I can't just--

48:17.503 --> 48:18.983
- I can't just pretend--
- He's just not ready. He's not
ready for the heartbreak.

48:19.157 --> 48:20.985
The heartbreak that
he's never had before.

48:21.159 --> 48:22.725
But, no, Mr. Russo, I don't
think that's a good idea. I--

48:22.900 --> 48:23.988
How about this? I give you
the money for that car.

48:26.425 --> 48:28.514
You-you think I would
take money from you?

48:28.688 --> 48:30.168
Not take it. No, no.

48:30.342 --> 48:31.691
It's like you're doing
something for me,

48:31.865 --> 48:33.084
so I'm just doing
something for you.

48:33.258 --> 48:34.302
- That's all it is.

48:34.476 --> 48:36.609
No, it's not. I...

48:37.697 --> 48:39.655
Can you--
Can you just pull over?

48:40.439 --> 48:42.006
- Pull-- Pull over?
- Yes, please.

48:42.180 --> 48:44.008
Oh. Ah, shit.

48:44.182 --> 48:45.792
- I'm so fucking stupid.
- It's really, I--

48:45.966 --> 48:47.054
Forget I said it.

48:47.750 --> 48:49.883
I never had to deal
with something like this,

48:50.057 --> 48:52.581
and I don't think
things through, and...

48:52.755 --> 48:54.105
I-I-I...

48:54.279 --> 48:56.063
It just popped in my head.

48:58.109 --> 49:00.633
Please. Forgive me

49:00.807 --> 49:02.765
- and just forget I said it.
- Yeah.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.550
- Okay.
- I apologize.

49:04.724 --> 49:06.073
It's okay.

49:06.421 --> 49:07.683
Can I just drive you
to work? And that...

49:07.857 --> 49:09.207
Sure.

49:09.381 --> 49:11.992
Okay.

49:27.312 --> 49:28.835
You know,
he didn't talk till...

49:31.011 --> 49:32.404
till he was like
four years old.

49:32.752 --> 49:34.928
I mean, he talked,
but never outside the house.

49:35.494 --> 49:37.278
Four years old.
Did he tell you that?

49:38.366 --> 49:41.369
People said take him to doctors
and this and that, but...

49:42.283 --> 49:43.981
His mom-- she's...

49:44.894 --> 49:47.636
She's tough, she don't believe
in any of that therapy stuff.

49:49.334 --> 49:52.685
Yeah. He was mostly
a normal kid.

49:52.859 --> 49:54.774
Ate his vegetables, all that.

49:56.297 --> 49:58.996
He just always,
for whatever reason...

50:01.433 --> 50:06.133
He don't feel comfortable
out in the world, this big kid.

50:10.050 --> 50:11.878
Camp, sleepovers...

50:13.010 --> 50:15.099
Even school. We--

50:15.273 --> 50:17.536
We'd drop him off
at school, and...

50:17.710 --> 50:19.625
and it would be good,
and we'd think...

50:21.018 --> 50:22.671
"Okay, all right, he's better."

50:24.760 --> 50:26.719
And then we get the call,
"Come and get him.

50:27.894 --> 50:29.243
He wants to come home."

50:31.071 --> 50:32.507
He felt safe at home.

50:36.163 --> 50:38.339
And then I got him
that hoop in the yard.

50:40.689 --> 50:41.908
He started playing it.

50:44.215 --> 50:45.694
Boy, when he hit that court...

50:47.609 --> 50:49.829
Oh. You seen him, right?

50:50.003 --> 50:51.352
- Yeah.
- Yean.

50:51.526 --> 50:52.788
Not at first, though.

50:52.962 --> 50:54.355
First I had to be there for him,

50:55.530 --> 50:57.228
even for the practices.

50:58.446 --> 51:00.753
He would look for me
in the stands and...

51:01.710 --> 51:03.712
and he'd point--
he'd point at me, you know,

51:03.886 --> 51:05.845
just to make sure I was there.

51:08.152 --> 51:12.025
Yeah, and I was... every time.

51:30.304 --> 51:31.914
Come on!

51:32.263 --> 51:34.526
<i>♪ Ooh, mamma,

51:34.700 --> 51:38.573
<i>♪ Ooh, mamma,

51:38.747 --> 51:40.445
Ooh, I'm Italian now!

51:40.619 --> 51:42.403
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

51:48.931 --> 51:50.498
- I don't get it.

51:50.672 --> 51:52.805
What's to get?
They're kids, Ange.

51:52.979 --> 51:55.416
Maybe she figured
she made a mistake, right?

51:55.590 --> 51:56.722
Here we go!

52:03.207 --> 52:05.644
He's, uh, so much
better now, you know?

52:06.906 --> 52:09.256
Yeah. He spent the last week
talking his dick off a ledge.

52:09.430 --> 52:11.171
- Mm-hmm.
- What does that mean?

52:12.172 --> 52:14.653
First time having sex, right?
That stops...

52:14.827 --> 52:16.133
Messes you up, man.

52:16.307 --> 52:18.831
No. Stupid.
They're not doing that.

52:19.005 --> 52:21.050
Of course they are.
The fuck is wrong with you?

52:22.139 --> 52:24.880
Yeah, but this...
I mean, look at him.

52:25.054 --> 52:26.839
That kid's asking for sex?

52:27.013 --> 52:28.623
Leo, I don't care
who the kid is.

52:28.797 --> 52:30.799
It's a fact
of biological science.

52:32.671 --> 52:34.151
Sal, please tell him
his kid's having sex.

52:34.325 --> 52:36.501
I mean, he does seem
a little different.

52:37.458 --> 52:40.026
Like he's, uh, floatin'.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.636
They're having sex, Leo,
all right?

52:41.810 --> 52:43.160
There's nothing
you can do about it.

52:50.906 --> 52:52.473
Hey, listen,
if I don't call you later,

52:52.821 --> 52:53.953
it's 'cause I got half
a history book I got to read.

52:54.127 --> 52:55.259
Yeah. Okay.

52:59.263 --> 53:01.178
- That's your dad?
- Yeah.

53:01.352 --> 53:04.877
Oh, man. Good thing
we weren't kissing, right?

53:05.921 --> 53:07.836
It's whatever.

53:08.010 --> 53:09.621
He's just gonna go
hide away in his office.

53:09.795 --> 53:11.231
I won't see him till tomorrow.

53:13.494 --> 53:15.670
- Wasn't gonna kiss you anyway.

53:16.628 --> 53:18.456
- Okay.
- Yeah.

53:18.630 --> 53:20.327
Not 'cause...

53:22.286 --> 53:23.635
Well, you ever seen <i>Rocky</i>?

53:24.853 --> 53:26.725
It's a boxing movie,

53:26.899 --> 53:28.553
make a bunch of them
with that old guy from <i>Creed</i>.

53:28.727 --> 53:30.468
- Yeah.
- Ah, uh-huh.

53:30.642 --> 53:33.035
There's this part
where his trainer,

53:33.210 --> 53:35.386
or his dad,
I'm not really sure,

53:35.560 --> 53:40.347
he tells him,
"Women weaken legs."

53:43.002 --> 53:45.134
Like... with sex.

53:47.615 --> 53:51.228
Anyway, my dad showed me
that scene this morning,

53:51.402 --> 53:53.665
and I guess he was trying
to tell me not to...

53:54.840 --> 54:00.324
You know, not to do anything
with you till after the tryout,

54:00.498 --> 54:03.327
just in case you were wondering
why I wasn't trying.

54:03.501 --> 54:06.330
No. Yeah, I--
I wasn't, like...

54:06.504 --> 54:08.070
I figured it was
something like that.

54:19.081 --> 54:20.344
Fadeaway!

54:28.482 --> 54:29.527
- Nice.
- Thanks.

54:52.376 --> 54:53.377
Nine...

54:54.465 --> 54:55.509
Ten...

54:56.205 --> 54:57.555
Eleven. Keep it going.
Let's go.

55:27.628 --> 55:28.934
Is this what
you're talking about?

55:29.108 --> 55:30.892
Yeah, that's it.
It wasn't there before.

55:33.242 --> 55:37.464
Well, uh, good news is...

55:37.638 --> 55:39.814
you're wrong.
It's scar tissue.

55:39.988 --> 55:41.903
- Really? You sure?
- One hundred percent.

55:42.077 --> 55:44.253
Should we sonogram it?

55:44.428 --> 55:45.777
Oh, no need.

55:45.951 --> 55:47.344
Well, ain't it good
just to know?

55:47.518 --> 55:49.781
Angela, I really think
you can relax.

55:49.955 --> 55:52.131
I'm still
in the danger zone, right?

55:52.305 --> 55:54.220
Not five years yet.
You said so yourself.

55:54.394 --> 55:57.832
Yeah, that's true, but I--
I'm telling you, you're fine.

55:58.006 --> 55:59.660
Look, for-for what you faced,

55:59.834 --> 56:01.488
it's normal to have
some anxiety.

56:01.662 --> 56:03.838
Oh, here we go. You want
to put me on pills now?

56:05.405 --> 56:07.712
Oh, I'm not saying that.
What about that, uh,

56:07.886 --> 56:09.496
that support group
that we talked about?

56:09.670 --> 56:12.064
My eyes don't look right
when I look in the mirror.

56:12.238 --> 56:15.676
I felt a lump in the same
damn spot I found the cancer.

56:15.850 --> 56:19.158
I don't need to talk
to fucking strangers about that!

56:23.597 --> 56:25.033
Margie, let's set up
a sonogram.

56:25.207 --> 56:26.600
Okay.

56:34.565 --> 56:36.480
Scar tissue. Wanna eat?

56:40.092 --> 56:41.528
Don't look at me.
I'm taking this.

56:43.487 --> 56:45.140
- I don't know.
- Hmm?

56:45.314 --> 56:47.447
- What do you think?
- Yeah, nice.

56:47.621 --> 56:48.666
For what?

56:48.840 --> 56:50.581
For the whatever the hell thing

56:50.755 --> 56:52.365
that the Brunos are having
at Versailles next month.

56:52.539 --> 56:54.019
Oh, right.

56:54.193 --> 56:55.847
These parties never stop.

56:56.021 --> 56:57.718
Italians got to celebrate
every fricking thing?

56:57.892 --> 56:59.503
Some little asshole has a first
Communion next month,

56:59.677 --> 57:01.330
I got to go out
and buy a whole new outfit?

57:05.117 --> 57:07.075
I'm thinking about
trying those dating apps.

57:07.249 --> 57:10.601
Ro, no, you don't need that.
All those creeps on there. No.

57:10.775 --> 57:12.603
I gotta do somethin'. I can't...

57:12.777 --> 57:15.823
as Frank so lovingly put it,
keep breaking Ma's heart.

57:15.997 --> 57:18.173
- Ro...
- I'm so done.

57:18.347 --> 57:22.700
No, you're gonna find a guy,
and he's gonna be so lucky,

57:22.874 --> 57:24.789
and Ma loves having you at home.

57:24.963 --> 57:29.315
And Frank's full of shit, making
you feel guilty about anything.

57:29.489 --> 57:30.795
Screw him.

57:30.969 --> 57:33.624
I know, right? Just ignore me.

57:34.538 --> 57:35.974
Stupid, stub dick asshole.

57:39.020 --> 57:40.892
You know that's true, right?
He's got a little stub dick.

57:41.066 --> 57:42.415
- Ro.
- I'm not kidding.

57:42.589 --> 57:44.548
I've seen both
those idiots naked.

57:44.722 --> 57:46.550
- Leo's is normal,
and Frank's looks like a...

57:46.724 --> 57:49.335
- A fucking ring pop.

57:49.509 --> 57:52.817
Maybe... that's why
Annie left him.

57:56.081 --> 57:59.040
- Don't tell anyone I said that.
-  I won't.

58:00.868 --> 58:02.043
Thank you. It's nice
to laugh with somebody.

58:02.217 --> 58:03.436
- Yeah, right?
- For a change.

58:03.610 --> 58:05.220
- I know.

58:07.353 --> 58:10.008
I got to go get more sauce.
They never give you
enough sauce.

58:10.182 --> 58:11.662
- Yeah, right?
- You want one?

58:11.836 --> 58:13.620
- Yeah, please.
- Uh, watch my... you know.

58:13.794 --> 58:15.448
- Right.
- Thank you.

58:15.622 --> 58:19.104
- Ring pop.

58:29.680 --> 58:31.682
<i>♪ Ain't no sunshine

58:31.856 --> 58:33.335
Oh God, he's gonna do
that fucking song again.

58:33.510 --> 58:35.163
Oh, no, Uncle Leo.
Come on, please.

58:35.424 --> 58:38.427

There's 26 "I know's".
Hey, Ange.

58:48.742 --> 58:51.919
Gonna punch this tramp
right in her little bitch face.

58:52.093 --> 58:53.530
What? Who?

58:54.356 --> 58:55.706
<i>Danielle.</i>

58:55.880 --> 58:58.099
What-- Why?
Did she say something?

58:58.273 --> 59:00.101
No, she's with
somebody-- a guy.

59:00.275 --> 59:02.103
They're right in front of me.
I'm looking right at 'em.

59:02.277 --> 59:03.975
<i>Okay. All right,
all right, calm down.</i>

59:04.236 --> 59:05.933
What does that mean? It could be
a friend, a cousin, right?

59:06.107 --> 59:07.848
Oh, she's making out
with her cousin. Let me go.

59:08.022 --> 59:09.894
- I'm calling Matthew.
- No, you can't tell him.

59:10.068 --> 59:11.243
Of course I'm telling him!

59:11.417 --> 59:12.897
Do you love him?

59:13.550 --> 59:15.943
- What does that mean?
- <i>Do you love him?</i>

59:16.117 --> 59:18.337
Because you've seen
what happened to him, Ange, huh?

59:18.511 --> 59:20.469
And-and-- And if you
tell him about this,

59:20.644 --> 59:21.949
he's gonna go right
back to how he was.

59:22.123 --> 59:24.299
So what,
just supposed to ignore it?

59:24.473 --> 59:27.520
<i>Ange, Ange, listen,
all I'm saying is,</i>

59:27.694 --> 59:30.305
just... un-- until he makes it.

59:31.350 --> 59:35.484
He gets on that team, Ange,
and everything changes for him.

59:36.268 --> 59:37.356
Everything.

59:45.407 --> 59:46.626
Oh, is that Dani?

59:52.763 --> 59:54.416
Hey, you had your breakfast,
right, Sticks?

59:54.591 --> 59:55.592
Yeah.

59:56.767 --> 59:58.290
How's your week been, Danielle?

59:59.683 --> 01:00:01.598
- Pretty boring, actually.
- Oh.

01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:04.775
Couldn't find nothing fun to do?

01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:06.690
Cow! Right there.

01:00:07.952 --> 01:00:09.388
That's a cow right there.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.043
You seen one of them, Dani?

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:13.958
Really, Dad?

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:16.308
I mean, in the wild here.

01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:18.310
Yeah. I've seen cows before.

01:00:18.484 --> 01:00:21.748
I'm sure you have.
You seem to get around a lot.

01:00:21.922 --> 01:00:24.533
I mean, I guess...
enough to have seen a cow.

01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:33.455
I heard it's bad for the earth
when they fart-- the cows.

01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:36.458
Yeah.

01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:43.291
All right. Here we are.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:48.601
You know that train station
we passed,

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:50.124
that goes all the way
to New York.

01:00:50.298 --> 01:00:51.735
You been on a train, Dani?

01:00:51.909 --> 01:00:54.694
- Dad. She's not Amish.
- No, far from it.

01:00:54.868 --> 01:00:57.741
Yeah. That's just the excitement
kind of bubbling out of me.

01:00:57.915 --> 01:00:59.394
- Sorry, Dani.
- Oh, it's okay.

01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:00.874
It is exciting.
This place looks beautiful.

01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:02.615
I know. With the trees
and all, right?

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:04.704
Guys, go ahead.
We'll, uh, we'll catch up.

01:01:04.878 --> 01:01:06.140
Sorry about my dad...

01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:07.228
What?

01:01:07.402 --> 01:01:08.926
What? You what?

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.536
You're gonna mess up
this whole thing, Ange.

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:12.669
Two hours, I gotta listen
to that phony?

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:15.584
She messed around
with a guy, huh? So what?

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:17.238
Remember you made out
with Scotty Amato that one time.

01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:19.414
Oh, here he goes again
with Scotty Amato.

01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:21.025
We weren't even seeing
each other then.

01:01:21.199 --> 01:01:22.983
Yeah, but you knew
that I liked you.

01:01:23.157 --> 01:01:25.290
- Ugh!
- And still it happened, right?

01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:26.900
- I let it go, though.
- Did you?

01:01:27.074 --> 01:01:28.902
'Cause you're still
talking about it.

01:01:29.076 --> 01:01:30.774
- Gotta let it go.

01:01:31.949 --> 01:01:33.080
You gotta let him go.

01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:36.388
Yeah, that's right.
That's what this is, huh?

01:01:36.562 --> 01:01:38.999
You, uh...
all the ladies, right?

01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:41.306
You wanna--
Connie, Patsy wanna baby him.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.351
- No. No, no.
- Keep 'em home
till they're frickin' 40.

01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:45.702
- Don't you compare me to them.
- No, you <i>are</i> them. I mean,

01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:47.442
- you sit together.
You talk about--
- No. They've got

01:01:47.616 --> 01:01:49.531
their whole fucking life
to spend with their kids.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.185
- I don't got that, Leo.
- What are you talking about?

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:53.405
- I don't got that.
- What are you--

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:54.928
Wait, wait, wait, Ange.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:57.714
It's back?

01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:01.805
- No.
- Then... what's going on?

01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:05.983
I'm a horrible fucking mother.

01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:08.681
- What? No.
- I saw her kissing that guy,

01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:10.814
and I knew
it would break his heart.

01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:12.903
And...

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:16.733
And I... I was glad.

01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:22.042
Because then he'd stay home,
and then I'd have more time.

01:02:23.304 --> 01:02:26.786
Ange, what? You--
You got so much time with him.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.268
No, you don't know that.
Leo, who knows that?

01:02:30.442 --> 01:02:33.314
Nobody. You, Ro,
Connie, and Patsy.

01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:35.229
I can't talk to them
about this shit.

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:36.796
They don't want to hear it.
They want to talk

01:02:37.057 --> 01:02:40.887
about baked ziti
and chicken fucking cutlets.

01:02:41.888 --> 01:02:45.587
I mean, I laugh with them.
I smile with them,
and they don't know that...

01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:51.289
even though I'm smiling,
really, I'm...

01:02:51.463 --> 01:02:52.507
Crying.

01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:55.684
Scared, Leo. Jesus Christ.

01:02:58.383 --> 01:03:02.300
I'm fucking scared.

01:03:04.693 --> 01:03:07.087
- Ange.

01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:09.611
Ange, listen, remember...

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.788
remember when
the chemo ended and...

01:03:11.962 --> 01:03:14.312
Remember Dr. Scarpulla?
He said to us...

01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:16.401
He looked us right in the face.

01:03:16.575 --> 01:03:20.884
And he said, "That's it.
You're cancer-free."

01:03:21.928 --> 01:03:25.192
Huh? Remember how happy
we were 'cause we beat it.

01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:28.761
That's it. That's the feeling
that you gotta keep in there.

01:03:28.935 --> 01:03:30.284
You can't let worrying

01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:33.244
stop you from living
like a-a normal life,

01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:34.506
'cause then...

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:37.248
then we didn't beat it.

01:03:39.598 --> 01:03:41.382
Yeah, okay.

01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:50.478
You can beat anything, eh?

01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:52.263
You're the strongest frickin'
woman I've ever known.

01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:54.352
- Okay, let's get inside.
- I mean it.

01:03:55.135 --> 01:03:56.789
If we had a fistfight
I would lose.

01:03:56.963 --> 01:03:59.574
Yeah.
Let's go.

01:03:59.748 --> 01:04:01.968
All right. Let's go. Come on.

01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:05.972
You know, the truth is,
if he makes this,

01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:07.844
you're probably gonna be
seeing more of him,

01:04:08.018 --> 01:04:10.150
'cause we're gonna come
to the games.

01:04:10.324 --> 01:04:12.326
Plus he's gonna come home
every weekend with his laundry.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.285
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.808
- He don't know how to do
that shit.
- Yeah, let's hope so.

01:04:15.982 --> 01:04:17.331
- Yeah.
- Is my makeup running?

01:04:17.505 --> 01:04:19.159
No, no, you're good.

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:20.857
- You didn't even look at me.
- No, but I know.

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:32.129
- How's he doing?
- I think he's nervous.

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:36.916
Oh, he's tight.

01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:38.483
I should have told him where
we were sitting or something.

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:40.528
Oh, he'll--
He'll be fine. Relax.

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:42.748
There's nothing we can do
from up here.

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:44.141
Yeah, there is.

01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:08.208
<i>Special request right now

01:05:08.382 --> 01:05:09.514

01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:25.138

01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:30.274

- I can see that.
- Yeah.

01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:56.909
- He's happy, so...
- We're all happy, Ange.

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:58.302
I mean, think about
how worried you were

01:05:58.476 --> 01:05:59.781
about that scared little kid,

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.131
and now he's going to college.

Let me back into you
a little bit.

01:06:19.888 --> 01:06:22.108
Sorry you had to come
to another of these.

01:06:22.282 --> 01:06:24.241
It's okay. I kind of like it.

01:06:25.155 --> 01:06:26.199
Me too.

01:06:26.939 --> 01:06:28.767
But I like being
anywhere with you.

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:36.905
- Rexel?
- Drexel.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.995
Drexel. It's in Philly.

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:41.040
Oh, it's--
it's a beautiful place.

01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:44.000
- They got trees there.
- Sounds nice.

01:06:44.174 --> 01:06:46.263
The gym holds 2,000.

01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:47.829
People, that's people.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.701
- You mentioned that already.
- Oh.

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.746
- I-I got to get back.
- Okay.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.880
The campus has a Chipotle.

01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:02.366
- Hey! There she is.
- I'm ending it. Tonight.

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:05.760
Oh, no. Here? Really?

01:07:05.934 --> 01:07:07.762
You said to wait until
the tryouts, and he did it.

01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:09.895
He got in,
so now it has to stop.

01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:14.291
But... I saw you two dancing,
and I thought I saw something.

01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:15.596
You're not feeling anything? No?

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.424
- Mr. Russo, please.
- Okay.

01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:19.426
I get it. The heart, right?

01:07:20.688 --> 01:07:23.343
Goes... Goes wherever it wants.

01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:25.302
Hm? It's like a coyote.

01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:30.655
Okay. Okay, but just--
just let me ask you one thing.

01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:32.483
Could you wait a week?

01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:35.660
Yeah-- 'Cause-- 'Cause Monday
he goes back to school,

01:07:35.834 --> 01:07:37.270
and if he could
just live with it,

01:07:37.444 --> 01:07:39.751
the-the good feeling
of what he done,

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:42.275
be the big shot
of his classmates...

01:07:42.449 --> 01:07:45.757
If-if that could sink in,
then when you...

01:07:46.845 --> 01:07:49.195
do what you-you got to do,

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:53.460
it-it'll be a lesser blow
to his heart, because...

01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:57.508
he-he'll know that he's...

01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:00.076
he's somebody now.

01:08:06.647 --> 01:08:08.127
Friday. That's it.

01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:09.781
Of course. Yes.

01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:12.131
Thank you. Thank you.
And-and listen to me,

01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:13.611
what you're doing for him,

01:08:14.525 --> 01:08:17.745
that's gonna change
his life irrevocably.

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.140
Hey.

01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:24.361
Just talking about you.
Just telling her about, um,

01:08:25.492 --> 01:08:27.451
when you were two
and ate a beetle.

01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:30.584
Why?

01:08:31.803 --> 01:08:32.760
- Ah--
- Come on, Leo!

01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:34.197
Oh! Ho-ho!

01:08:35.763 --> 01:08:36.982
- Here we go.
- Here we go!

01:08:39.637 --> 01:08:40.855
You want to go home?

01:08:41.726 --> 01:08:44.163
- Uh, now?
- It's half over.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:48.036
- Sure.
- Come on.

01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:49.864
- You've suffered enough.
- Okay.

01:08:52.824 --> 01:08:56.132
- Ready to kick it up?

01:08:58.090 --> 01:08:59.526
Don't think
I swallowed it.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.007
Just kind of crawled
around in my mouth.

01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:04.052
Gross.

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:08.187
Where are you going?

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.626
Figured we'd go to our spot?

01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:30.862
Wrote you another poem.

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:33.560
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:09:34.866 --> 01:09:37.390
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna read it right now.

01:09:37.564 --> 01:09:41.307
It's still lame, but I'm
getting better, I think.

01:09:51.926 --> 01:09:53.493
Should we get in the back?

01:09:54.364 --> 01:09:55.843
- Meet you there?

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:05.375
Uh...

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.816
Hey. Not as funny.
My pants are still on.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:18.126
Dani?

01:10:25.743 --> 01:10:28.354
Just... please
don't be mad at me.

01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:30.182
What's wrong?

01:10:31.836 --> 01:10:33.490
Just don't hate me.

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:36.580
Hate you?

01:10:37.929 --> 01:10:38.930
I love you.

01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:45.371
I know. Shit. I know!

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:46.851
And I'm sorry, but--

01:10:47.591 --> 01:10:49.810
I-I never should have done this.

01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:51.072
Done what?

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:53.771
He was worried
about you, Sticks,

01:10:53.945 --> 01:10:58.166
and he came to my house,
and I just-- I wanted-- I...

01:10:58.341 --> 01:10:59.951
Ugh! Fuck! What am I-- Fuck!

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:01.648
- Who? Worried about what?
- Gosh, no,

01:11:01.909 --> 01:11:03.433
I shouldn't have said anything.
I don't know why...

01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:06.392
- I-- [sighs] I have to go.
- Dani, wait!

01:11:06.566 --> 01:11:10.091
Just forget about it. Just
forget about all of it, okay?

01:11:12.572 --> 01:11:13.921
Wait!

01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:24.280
You know,
you're lucky, Sticks.

01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:29.937
To have family
that cares that much.

01:11:35.769 --> 01:11:36.901
I'm sorry.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.961
Nicholas!

01:11:57.443 --> 01:11:58.618
Oh, that's--
That's it right there.

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:00.968
That's how it's done, people.

01:12:01.142 --> 01:12:03.319
Come on, y'all!
This is 50 years of marriage!

01:12:03.493 --> 01:12:07.410
You gotta jam like her right now
Vito and Eleanor, this for you!

01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:09.803
Let's leave now before
the valet parking gets nuts.

01:12:09.977 --> 01:12:12.328
Get m'lady home
for a spot of tea and a shag.

01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:14.634
Christ.

01:12:14.982 --> 01:12:16.593
- Think he'll start?
- I don't think so.
Probably not at the beginning.

01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:19.596
If he works hard enough,
he will get there.

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:22.033
Not for nothing, maybe we get
a little point shaving thing.

01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:23.382
- Petey.
- Who's gonna know?

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.297
I'm like his uncle.

01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:27.343
- Can't win me
a couple of bucks?

01:12:27.517 --> 01:12:29.170
Oh, my God.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.955
That Joey Bones don't stop,
he's gonna kill us all.

01:12:31.129 --> 01:12:33.261
I tell you
what I can't wait for.

01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:36.961
All of us going to a game, huh?
How much fun is that gonna be?

01:12:37.135 --> 01:12:39.920
You guys, you can come,
huh? Be fun.

01:12:40.094 --> 01:12:42.619
- Some people work.
- Oh, yeah, you can't be happy

01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:44.055
for anyone doing better
than you, right?

01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:45.665
Who's doing better than me?

01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:47.450
-  Come on, you guys.

01:12:47.711 --> 01:12:49.408
What Sticks is doing,
it's a reflection on all of us.

01:12:49.582 --> 01:12:52.629
- That's right.
- All right, lads and ladies,

01:12:52.803 --> 01:12:56.502
I'm gonna lower this music
'cause it's cake time!

01:12:56.676 --> 01:13:00.027
Ah, Yeah. I love cake.

01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:01.812
I love cake. I love cake.

01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:04.815
I always love cake.

01:13:04.989 --> 01:13:06.686
Hey, big man.

01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:11.691
What's wrong, Matthew?

01:13:14.128 --> 01:13:16.043
Dani broke up with me.

01:13:16.217 --> 01:13:18.698
- Just went back with you.
- What, she got the bipolar?

01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:20.091
Got another word
for what she is.

01:13:20.265 --> 01:13:21.614
What happened, Matthew?

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.313
I don't know. She just
started crying and ran away.

01:13:26.314 --> 01:13:28.926
Dad, did you go to her house?

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.798
What? What does that mean?

01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:35.628
She said Dad talked to her
at her house.

01:13:35.802 --> 01:13:38.631
- You didn't go to her house.
- No. No.

01:13:38.805 --> 01:13:41.242
Go to her house. What--
Why am I gonna do that?

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:42.940
Here's what's happening.

01:13:43.288 --> 01:13:46.900
This is a kid who's messed up,
confused, probably.

01:13:47.074 --> 01:13:52.297
She's making stuff up to explain
whatever she can't explain.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.777
That's what's happening.

01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:56.083
Sit. <i>Mangia la</i> cake.

01:13:56.257 --> 01:13:58.999
Yeah, come on.
Come on, Sticks, sit down.

01:13:59.173 --> 01:14:01.175
I don't want cake.
Give that-- Give that to him.

01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:04.091
That's got the--
the cherry stuff in the middle.

01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:05.789
-  Leo.
- Come on.

01:14:06.137 --> 01:14:07.225
That's your favorite
right there. Come on, Sticks.

01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:08.922
- Leonard.
- What?

01:14:10.184 --> 01:14:11.577
You go to the girl's house?

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:14.362
No! I-I just said I'd--
No. I told you that.

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:16.408
Yeah, I know what you told us.

01:14:16.582 --> 01:14:18.932
I also know when you're
covering up for something

01:14:19.106 --> 01:14:20.630
- you half-assed.
- Why--

01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:21.761
- Same here.
- Why are you saying all this?

01:14:21.935 --> 01:14:22.893
You can't see he's upset?

01:14:23.067 --> 01:14:24.068
Yeah, I can see that.

01:14:24.242 --> 01:14:25.983
Okay, so let him eat cake.

01:14:26.157 --> 01:14:27.550
That's all we're trying here.

01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:30.291
Sit down, and we can
all calm down, right?

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.771
And talk about
all the good stuff

01:14:31.945 --> 01:14:33.338
that's happening to him
right now--

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:35.514
basketball, Philadelphia,
the cows.

01:14:35.688 --> 01:14:37.037
- Leo!
- What?!

01:14:39.344 --> 01:14:40.519
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

01:14:40.693 --> 01:14:41.955
I didn't do anything!

01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:45.916
Dad.

01:14:48.048 --> 01:14:49.180
Please.

01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:58.668
I-I did. I talked to her.

01:14:58.842 --> 01:15:00.365
- I knew it!
- Shut up, all right?

01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:01.714
- Huh? Just shut the fuck up.
- Hey, hey.

01:15:01.888 --> 01:15:03.411
It was to help you, Sticks.

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:04.935
What'd you do, Leo?

01:15:05.109 --> 01:15:06.545
She left, and you were so sad.

01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:09.200
- What did you do?
- I told her the truth.

01:15:09.374 --> 01:15:12.856
That he couldn't play
after she left, that he was...

01:15:14.858 --> 01:15:16.294
He was crumbling.

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:21.299
And maybe if she could just,
you know...

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:25.259
stay with him a little longer.

01:15:25.433 --> 01:15:27.131
-  Oh, shit.
- What?

01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:29.002
She was pretending?

01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:31.570
No. No, no, she wanted
to do this. She cares about you.

01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:33.529
She didn't want the money.
She didn't want nothing.

01:15:33.703 --> 01:15:34.878
- Money?
-  Oh, my God.

01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:37.184
- Wow.
- Jesus Christ, Leo!

01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:39.099
- Who's doing better now, Ro?
- What's the matter with you?

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:41.406
Okay. What should I do? Let him
be like your fucking kids?

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.364
- Oh, you wanna talk
about my kids?
- Oh, no, come on.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:45.323
I don't pay nobody
to be with 'em!

01:15:45.497 --> 01:15:48.282
- She didn't want the money.
- Hey, and cake time is over...

01:15:48.456 --> 01:15:49.762
That's the point
I'm making here.

01:15:49.936 --> 01:15:51.242
All she wanted to do
was help him.

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:52.983
Let-let's twist, everybody.

01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:54.724
- Get up and let's twist.

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:56.552
She didn't want any of it.
She cares about you.

01:15:56.726 --> 01:15:59.598
That-- No, no. Sticks. No, no.

01:15:59.772 --> 01:16:02.340
No, leave him alone.
You done enough.

01:16:02.514 --> 01:16:05.822
What? What did I do?
I got him into college!
Huh, what did I do?

01:16:05.996 --> 01:16:09.216
Open your damn eyes!
You humiliated him!

01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:13.743
So what? And then he--
he don't get an education.

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:18.051
Huh? He goes straight to Russo,
working for you and Frank.

01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:22.969
No, I'm trying to save him
from a lifetime of humiliation!

01:16:26.756 --> 01:16:28.496
Except that's not really
the reason.

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:30.847
Huh?

01:16:31.021 --> 01:16:32.109
You want him
to get an education, Leo,

01:16:32.283 --> 01:16:34.198
or you want him to play ball?

01:16:34.372 --> 01:16:35.373
The ball gets him the education.

01:16:35.547 --> 01:16:37.070
What's it get you? Hmm?

01:16:37.244 --> 01:16:38.985
More attention,
more kids cheerin' your name?

01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:40.465
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:41.945
- Be fucking honest.
- I am being honest!

01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:43.120
That you want this for yourself!

01:16:43.294 --> 01:16:44.338
You be honest!

01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:48.299
She told me herself
she didn't want him to make it!

01:16:48.473 --> 01:16:50.562
She wanted him to stay home
because she would--

01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:41.526
Okay! Let's get the love
back in the room.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.484
I know exactly how,
with some...

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.399
Hokey fucking Pokey.

01:18:00.763 --> 01:18:02.590
- Leo!
- Huh?

01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:05.550
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone, Petey.

01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:07.291
Come on. You're piss drunk here.

01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:08.814
- I'm taking you home.
- Leave me alone!

01:18:08.988 --> 01:18:10.076
- I'm taking you home.
- Get off!

01:18:12.949 --> 01:18:15.734
Shit. That was an accident.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.258
Give me yours.

01:18:18.432 --> 01:18:20.434
What? No, it was an accident.

01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:22.262
Get the fuck outta here.

01:18:22.436 --> 01:18:24.090
- Give me your jacket.
- Leo, what are you doing?

01:18:24.264 --> 01:18:26.614
- Come on. Take it off!
- No!

01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:28.442
- Let go of me! What the--
- Give me that jacket!

01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:30.531
What, are you out of your mind?
Oh, come on!

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:32.969
Leo, my god! Aah!

01:18:33.143 --> 01:18:36.494
-  Let go.
- Oh, shit! Let go.

01:18:36.668 --> 01:18:39.279
- Let go! That's enough!

01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:42.718
What the fuck, Leo?

01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:46.765
You know, you've always been
there for me.

01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:50.029
Why don't you let me be
the one to help you for once?

01:18:52.945 --> 01:18:54.599
You want to help me, Petey?

01:18:56.906 --> 01:18:58.124
- Leave me alone.
- Come on.

01:18:58.298 --> 01:18:59.822
- Leave me alone.
- Come on.

01:18:59.996 --> 01:19:01.954
Oh, for crying out loud, Leo.

01:19:02.128 --> 01:19:03.782
It's my only jacket.

01:19:55.878 --> 01:19:58.184
- I've got a gun, asshole!
- Huh?

01:20:00.099 --> 01:20:01.144
Leo?

01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:09.021
Jeez, I-I can't believe this.

01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:11.763
I mean, you don't see
homeless guys around here.

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:13.634
- Yeah.
-  Oh.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.594
- He just grabbed you?
- Yeah...

01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:19.379
- 'Cause of drugs.
- Oh.

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.948
What were you
doing over here anyway?

01:20:23.122 --> 01:20:26.169
I, uh, just needed a walk.

01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:33.698
You're a good lady.

01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:42.750
We should really disinfect this.

01:20:42.925 --> 01:20:45.101
I got some peroxide upstairs.

01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:51.107
Should we go up and get it?

01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:57.853
Yeah. Okay.

01:21:16.132 --> 01:21:17.481
Give me your hand.

01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:28.100
Is that Ed?

01:21:28.274 --> 01:21:30.711
- Oh, God, no. That's my dad.
- Oh.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.671
Looks like a nice guy.

01:21:33.845 --> 01:21:36.500
- Eh, he left when I was seven.
- Hm.

01:21:39.198 --> 01:21:41.157
- That's not nice.
- No.

01:21:42.767 --> 01:21:45.509
He was done, you know?
He didn't wanna be here anymore.

01:21:46.466 --> 01:21:48.468
That's what my mom said,
anyway, so...

01:21:52.733 --> 01:21:54.518
Still keep his picture,
though, huh?

01:21:58.174 --> 01:21:59.175
Yeah.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.223
I guess time heals
everything, right?

01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:09.663
- Or you just never know.
- Yeah.

01:22:11.317 --> 01:22:14.407
The one thing I do know,
when Ed died on me...

01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:19.108
is that the only time
that you're guaranteed...

01:22:22.372 --> 01:22:23.416
is right now.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.905
I'll be right back.

01:22:48.267 --> 01:22:50.139
You know I liked you
from the start, Leo.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.404
- How come?

01:22:56.406 --> 01:22:59.104
I don't know, you know?
You're-- you're different.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.802
You got heart.

01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:11.769
Got heart, but I ain't
got no locker, do I, Mick?

01:23:15.207 --> 01:23:16.252
What was that?

01:23:18.384 --> 01:23:19.995
Mickey. He, uh...

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.563
He gave away Rocky's locker.

01:23:23.737 --> 01:23:25.348
He gave it to another fighter

01:23:26.218 --> 01:23:28.264
because he thought
that, uh, Rocky...

01:23:30.309 --> 01:23:31.441
was a bum.

01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:35.010
Oh. Okay.

01:23:36.315 --> 01:23:38.361
My wife was right. I...

01:23:39.449 --> 01:23:41.190
I hurt my whole family.

01:23:43.975 --> 01:23:45.063
Just so I...

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:50.764
I-I wouldn't feel
like a bum anymore.

01:23:53.158 --> 01:23:55.552
Okay. What's happening here?

01:23:55.726 --> 01:23:57.249
Uh, I'm not sure.

01:23:59.295 --> 01:24:01.210
All I know is, um...

01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:06.954
I can't do sex with you.

01:24:12.438 --> 01:24:14.049
- Oh.
- We didn't do nothing!

01:24:15.398 --> 01:24:17.269
It got weird, but I left!

01:24:44.557 --> 01:24:46.037
Oh, Petey.

01:24:46.951 --> 01:24:48.083
Shit.

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:51.086
Stupid jacket.

01:25:32.736 --> 01:25:35.086
-  I, uh...

01:25:37.741 --> 01:25:39.264
I slept on the grass.

01:25:40.352 --> 01:25:41.875
I didn't want to wake you.

01:25:42.049 --> 01:25:43.181
How thoughtful.

01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:50.145
Listen, Sticks, I...

01:25:51.711 --> 01:25:55.237
I guess... what I'm trying
to say here is, uh...

01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.415
I-I always...

01:26:01.243 --> 01:26:03.984
I always try to do
what I think is best for you.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:07.031
- I'll eat this later, Ma.
- But not this time.

01:26:08.293 --> 01:26:09.773
I mean, uh...

01:26:10.426 --> 01:26:13.037
If I'm telling the truth
to myself, I-I...

01:26:13.211 --> 01:26:15.126
A lot of what I did was...

01:26:16.388 --> 01:26:18.956
It was... for me.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.743
And-and-- And also,
you were right.

01:26:23.917 --> 01:26:25.832
When-when you said
that I didn't know,

01:26:27.007 --> 01:26:29.314
I never had nobody
break my heart.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.925
I didn't know
what you were feeling.

01:26:32.839 --> 01:26:36.539
I do know one thing
that's, like, similar.

01:26:37.627 --> 01:26:39.237
I know what first love
feels like.

01:26:40.847 --> 01:26:43.372
Man, to lose that?

01:26:52.032 --> 01:26:53.425
I got lucky, Sticks.

01:26:55.384 --> 01:26:56.472
I got real lucky.

01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:01.433
And I-I promise you,

01:27:01.607 --> 01:27:03.435
one day you're gonna
get lucky too.

01:27:07.831 --> 01:27:08.919
Anyway, uh...

01:27:10.486 --> 01:27:12.314
I just hope
that you can forgive me.

01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:19.886
Not yet.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.501
Okay.

01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:39.645
I'm not going to that school.

01:27:42.431 --> 01:27:43.432
Yeah.

01:28:00.579 --> 01:28:02.886
We're scheduled to wrap
on the 25th.

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.714
I don't know how fast
you want me to move.

01:28:04.888 --> 01:28:07.543
I got my entire crew working
in there day and night!

01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:11.198
Hammers waking her up
in the morning?

01:28:11.373 --> 01:28:13.157
What the fuck is up her ass?

01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:14.898
Yeah, I don't think
it's personal.

01:28:15.072 --> 01:28:17.204
I think she's just
a little lonely, that's all.

01:28:17.379 --> 01:28:19.424
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Is that what you think?

01:28:29.129 --> 01:28:30.522
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28:36.398 --> 01:28:37.834
- Hmm.

01:28:38.008 --> 01:28:40.619
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah, that's-- Yeah.

01:28:44.014 --> 01:28:46.364
Pops wants me down
at the lumber yard right away.

01:28:46.538 --> 01:28:48.323
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Petey.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.629
Listen, uh...

01:28:50.803 --> 01:28:52.762
Uh, look, I owe you, uh--

01:28:52.936 --> 01:28:54.503
Forget it, weirdo.
You were drunk.

01:28:54.677 --> 01:28:57.288
We wrestled in the plants.
It's over.

01:28:59.029 --> 01:29:00.465
Okay. All right. Thanks.

01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:02.859
I didn't hurt you,
though, right?

01:29:04.469 --> 01:29:07.864
Had to ice my knee and pull
pottery out of my ass,
but I'm fine.

01:29:09.996 --> 01:29:11.215
Fucked you up, though.

01:29:20.006 --> 01:29:22.139
Found that T-shirt
you thought you lost.

01:29:38.677 --> 01:29:40.592
You remember
when I shaved my head?

01:29:42.942 --> 01:29:44.553
It was this day.

01:29:44.814 --> 01:29:47.643
You had a tournament. Your dad
said he had to go to it.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:51.647
Told me to wait to shave it off,
but I'd started the chemo,

01:29:51.821 --> 01:29:54.040
and the hair was already
coming out in clumps,

01:29:54.214 --> 01:29:57.827
and I just wanted to get it
over with, you know, so...

01:29:58.001 --> 01:30:02.135
drove myself to the salon,
and they buzzed it.

01:30:02.875 --> 01:30:05.356
And of course,
all the salon ladies--

01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:07.576
they're all blabbing
about how good I look,

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:10.840
how I got a good head shape
and all of that.

01:30:11.014 --> 01:30:12.581
'cause they got to say that.

01:30:12.755 --> 01:30:15.148
I-I... And I don't want
to hear it from them.

01:30:17.107 --> 01:30:20.153
I-I want to know what
your father thinks, my husband.

01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:23.635
So I text him a picture.

01:30:25.245 --> 01:30:26.246
What'd he say?

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.554
He said I look like a mutant.

01:30:32.296 --> 01:30:35.212
'Cause he thought it'd make me
laugh, make me feel better.

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.345
That was this day.

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:49.618
He's so fucking
stupid sometimes.

01:31:06.678 --> 01:31:09.420
- We start at seven.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

01:31:09.594 --> 01:31:11.814
I just-- I had some stuff
to deal with at the house.

01:31:11.988 --> 01:31:14.251
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

01:31:14.425 --> 01:31:16.906
Anyway, listen, um,
I-I said some things

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.083
to you and Frank
last night, and, uh...

01:31:20.257 --> 01:31:21.867
Let's forget it.

01:31:22.128 --> 01:31:24.130
No, yeah. I-I just want you
to know that I didn't--

01:31:24.304 --> 01:31:26.089
You gonna make me say,
"Forget it" again?

01:31:27.525 --> 01:31:28.483
No.

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:32.008
No.

01:31:33.792 --> 01:31:34.967
All right.

01:31:35.141 --> 01:31:36.621
Is he going?

01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:43.062
No.

01:31:46.762 --> 01:31:48.024
You okay with that?

01:31:50.635 --> 01:31:51.854
Gotta be, right?

01:31:53.595 --> 01:31:55.553
I guess that's true.

01:31:57.903 --> 01:31:59.426
He's lucky to have you, Leonard.

01:32:06.695 --> 01:32:07.783
Thanks, Dad.

01:32:17.836 --> 01:32:18.837
Hey!

01:32:20.273 --> 01:32:22.145
We're outta here, baby!

01:32:57.136 --> 01:32:58.137
Shit.

01:33:05.841 --> 01:33:06.755
Hey.

01:33:08.931 --> 01:33:10.193
Hey.

01:33:12.412 --> 01:33:14.632
Uh, uh, I was just
driving by, and, um--

01:33:14.806 --> 01:33:17.113
Uh, you're gonna have
to buy something.

01:33:17.287 --> 01:33:18.244
Huh?

01:33:20.246 --> 01:33:21.465
Uh...

01:33:23.249 --> 01:33:24.947
I'll take some gum, I guess.

01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:27.210
Sure. It's $1.75.

01:33:33.259 --> 01:33:35.958
- Juicy Fruit.
- It's a classic.

01:33:38.743 --> 01:33:39.875
I, um...

01:33:40.963 --> 01:33:43.574
I just-- I figured
you might run into somebody,

01:33:43.748 --> 01:33:46.185
hear about it eventually,
but, um...

01:33:47.404 --> 01:33:49.624
I'm not going to Philadelphia.

01:33:51.451 --> 01:33:52.670
Fuck.

01:33:53.018 --> 01:33:54.324
Oh, no, don't.
Please don't feel bad.

01:33:54.498 --> 01:33:56.413
That's why I came.

01:33:58.371 --> 01:34:00.635
Uh... truth is...

01:34:02.419 --> 01:34:04.290
I don't think
I ever really wanted it.

01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:10.775
Figured I'd try to find
my own... thing...

01:34:12.168 --> 01:34:13.212
for me.

01:34:14.779 --> 01:34:16.825
And you showed me that.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:21.568
All right. Look,
you-you got your gum.

01:34:21.743 --> 01:34:23.527
- If you're not gonna eat--
- Armon, not now!

01:34:23.701 --> 01:34:26.399
Oh. Every day,
something with this girl.

01:34:26.573 --> 01:34:28.314
What were you saying?

01:34:32.318 --> 01:34:34.320
I think I was saying thanks.

01:34:37.976 --> 01:34:40.196
Well, you're welcome.

01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:47.812
So when are you leaving?

01:34:49.553 --> 01:34:50.641
Two weeks.

01:34:52.121 --> 01:34:54.601
- Wow.
-  Yeah.

01:34:56.603 --> 01:34:58.344
Twenty-five hundred miles.

01:35:02.087 --> 01:35:03.175
You scared?

01:35:06.526 --> 01:35:08.180
Everybody's scared, Sticks.

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:32.465
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:35:32.639 --> 01:35:34.467
<i>let's give a big hand
for the newly christened...</i>

01:35:36.121 --> 01:35:39.385
...baby Isabella!

01:35:43.476 --> 01:35:45.304
- She's cute.
- All right.

01:35:46.915 --> 01:35:48.655
The bow's crooked.

01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:50.962
Don't run. You're a grandma.

01:35:51.136 --> 01:35:54.139
That's a bad bow. Hold on. Stop.
It's over her eye.

01:35:54.313 --> 01:35:56.489
- She loves her bow.
- You made her cry.

01:35:56.663 --> 01:35:57.969
- I didn't make her cry.
- Yes, you did.

01:35:58.143 --> 01:36:00.232
- Oh, stop it, smile!

01:36:00.406 --> 01:36:01.581
Didn't we just go
to their wedding?

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:03.235
Yeah, about five months ago.

01:36:03.409 --> 01:36:05.629
- <i>Puttana.</i>

01:36:05.803 --> 01:36:07.370
- What does that mean?
- Nothing good.

01:36:07.544 --> 01:36:08.937
What's everyone
doing in their seats?

01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:12.767
Come on!
Let's make this a party!

01:36:12.941 --> 01:36:14.507
Are you serious?

01:36:14.681 --> 01:36:17.206
Oh, my God. This dude
is bush league, okay?

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:18.729
You can't yell
at the crowd like that.

01:36:18.903 --> 01:36:20.644
There's a nuance
to what you do with it.

01:36:20.905 --> 01:36:23.516
Babe, no one is as good as you,
but you're not working today.

01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:26.302
-  Let's go!
- You know what? You're right.

01:36:26.476 --> 01:36:28.391
How about we go cut a rug
and help this kid out?

01:36:28.565 --> 01:36:30.262
- Yes.
- Ah. Come on, you.

01:36:32.612 --> 01:36:34.963
I will have your daughter
back shortly, good sir.

01:36:35.137 --> 01:36:36.312
Don't break anything.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.185
Coming through! Ooh, ahh!

01:36:40.359 --> 01:36:42.361
- "Good sir."
- "Oh, let's cut a rug, baby."

01:36:42.535 --> 01:36:44.233
- Hey, shut up.
- Come on, Dad.

01:36:44.407 --> 01:36:46.191
Look at the clown she's with.
Guy's a goober.

01:36:46.365 --> 01:36:47.845
We're just bustin'
Aunt Ro's chops.

01:36:48.019 --> 01:36:50.500
She's happy,
so shut the hell up, all right?

01:36:50.674 --> 01:36:52.154
- Frank, I got it.
- We were-- Okay, but--

01:36:52.328 --> 01:36:54.504
- Hey, what the hell?
- Show some respect.

01:36:54.678 --> 01:36:55.722
Hey, it's a new jacket.

01:36:55.897 --> 01:36:57.637
I got to go. Uh...

01:36:57.812 --> 01:36:59.639
Just tell 'em
congratulations for me.

01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:01.163
Where are you going?

01:37:01.424 --> 01:37:03.818
Well, I-I told you, Dad.
I got some stuff.

01:37:03.992 --> 01:37:06.908
Seven a.m., Monday, eh?
Lumber deliveries.

01:37:07.082 --> 01:37:08.735
- Okay.
- Don't be late.

01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:09.954
Am I ever?

01:37:11.477 --> 01:37:14.002
- Every day.
- Mm-hmm.

01:37:27.754 --> 01:37:29.800
- Okay. I'll see you soon.
- Okay. Okay.

01:37:29.974 --> 01:37:31.410
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

01:37:32.759 --> 01:37:34.500
- Open the door.
- Oh.

01:37:37.764 --> 01:37:39.549
So all of them had cancer?

01:37:39.723 --> 01:37:43.074
Huh? No, they got all kinds
of meetings. Alcohol, drugs.

01:37:43.248 --> 01:37:45.381
- My group was cancer.
- A lot of people, huh?

01:37:45.555 --> 01:37:47.252
Yeah. What'd you tell everybody?

01:37:47.426 --> 01:37:49.385
Oh, I just said that
you had the pink eye.

01:37:49.559 --> 01:37:51.648
Pink eye?
I told you to say fever.

01:37:51.822 --> 01:37:55.434
I know. I wanted to say that,
but, uh, came out "pink eye."

01:37:57.088 --> 01:37:59.699
Well, what do I care
what they know?

01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:02.311
So what do you do in there?
You just talk?

01:38:02.485 --> 01:38:03.878
Yeah, that's it.

01:38:05.053 --> 01:38:06.358
You think it's gonna help?

01:38:06.532 --> 01:38:07.882
Mm, maybe.

01:38:09.535 --> 01:38:10.710
That's good.

01:38:14.801 --> 01:38:17.282
- Oh, shit. Let's go.

01:38:19.458 --> 01:38:21.243
I knew it was
this side of the campus.

01:38:21.417 --> 01:38:23.810
How was I supposed to know?
We never been here before.

01:38:23.985 --> 01:38:25.769
Excuse me.
This is the little gym?

01:38:25.943 --> 01:38:28.032
- Uh, yeah, right there.
- Okay, thanks.

01:38:28.206 --> 01:38:30.600
- Oh, now we're late.
- Well, don't blame me.

01:38:30.774 --> 01:38:33.472
I'm not blaming you.
I'm just saying it's your fault.

01:38:33.646 --> 01:38:35.866
-  See? It's empty.

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.563
You don't know
where you're going.

01:38:37.737 --> 01:38:40.218
Will you stop?
He said to come through here.

01:38:40.392 --> 01:38:42.177
But you don't know
if this is the here.

01:38:42.351 --> 01:38:43.787
Well, nobody knows that.

01:38:44.614 --> 01:38:46.355
So we will lift our voice,
and we sing.

01:38:46.529 --> 01:38:48.444
We stand on our feet,
and we dance.

01:38:48.618 --> 01:38:51.795
This is the beauty
and the majesty of an instrument

01:38:51.969 --> 01:38:54.102
in the hands of a magician.

01:38:54.276 --> 01:38:58.671
The truth-- the truth
is acoustic, perfect,

01:38:58.845 --> 01:39:02.110
like fits, like pitch,
like cadence,

01:39:02.284 --> 01:39:05.113
like symphony and breath.
So listen.

01:39:06.375 --> 01:39:10.074
Within these walls, listen,

01:39:10.248 --> 01:39:12.250
because the music...

01:39:12.424 --> 01:39:15.297
never stops playing.

01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:24.523
- Marshall Davis Jones, guys.
-  I don't, um...

01:39:24.697 --> 01:39:26.482
Yeah. Me neither.

01:39:26.656 --> 01:39:29.180
Thank you so much for coming
back to where you started.

01:39:29.354 --> 01:39:31.574
All right, I don't envy
having to follow that,

01:39:31.748 --> 01:39:33.141
but let's get into it.

01:39:34.707 --> 01:39:36.971
Oh, we about to throw
a freshman lamb
to the slaughter here, guys.

01:39:37.145 --> 01:39:39.147
- Okay.

01:39:39.321 --> 01:39:41.497
For his first time
at Queensborough Spoken Word,

01:39:41.671 --> 01:39:43.934
reciting a piece he calls
"The Arena"...

01:39:44.761 --> 01:39:45.980
Matthew Russo.

01:39:49.157 --> 01:39:52.203
Whoo! Go, Matthew! Yeah!

01:40:07.653 --> 01:40:08.872
We shouldn't have come.

01:40:10.091 --> 01:40:11.527
"What does it look like?

01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:16.401
Always wanted to know.

01:40:17.881 --> 01:40:20.188
What does the thing look like?

01:40:21.711 --> 01:40:23.582
The thing that
won't let me breathe...

01:40:25.454 --> 01:40:26.890
won't let me leave...

01:40:28.457 --> 01:40:30.981
won't even let me talk.

01:40:33.462 --> 01:40:35.029
You don't get to see it, though.

01:40:37.292 --> 01:40:38.815
Like the Invisible Man...

01:40:39.903 --> 01:40:43.559
the only time you see him
is when he suits up.

01:40:45.474 --> 01:40:47.389
And the only time
the thing suits up...

01:40:48.781 --> 01:40:50.087
is in the arena."

01:40:51.132 --> 01:40:52.437
Oh, that's the title.

01:40:52.611 --> 01:40:54.657
"So that's what I do every day.

01:40:54.831 --> 01:40:57.399
I get in the arena,
and there it is."

01:40:59.618 --> 01:41:00.706
"Fear."

01:41:07.496 --> 01:41:08.627
"And we fight...

01:41:10.151 --> 01:41:11.152
hard.

01:41:13.023 --> 01:41:14.720
I lose most of the time.

01:41:21.162 --> 01:41:22.641
But that's okay.

01:41:24.861 --> 01:41:26.558
I know what it looks like now.

01:41:28.038 --> 01:41:29.822
And every time
it gets in the arena,

01:41:30.823 --> 01:41:32.260
I'm getting in there too.

01:41:33.957 --> 01:41:35.176
And one day...

01:41:37.178 --> 01:41:38.483
I'm gonna fuck 'em up."

01:41:38.657 --> 01:41:40.833
-  Oh!

01:41:41.007 --> 01:41:43.184
"I'm gonna fuck 'em up
real bad."

01:41:43.358 --> 01:41:45.882
- Yeah, you are.

01:41:46.056 --> 01:41:48.580
"It's gonna stumble
and grab me so it don't fall."

01:41:48.754 --> 01:41:50.234
-  Come on.

01:41:50.582 --> 01:41:52.715
"Then pull me in close
and whisper in my ear..."

01:41:54.499 --> 01:41:56.501
"'Ain't gonna be no rematch.'"

01:41:56.675 --> 01:41:58.024
- Whoo!

01:41:58.199 --> 01:41:59.939
"'Ain't gonna be no rematch.'"

01:42:07.338 --> 01:42:08.948
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:42:34.757 --> 01:42:38.500
Whoo! I love you,
Matthew! Whoo!

01:42:38.674 --> 01:42:40.154
Who's this whore?
