WEBVTT

00:01.433 --> 00:03.900
- WELL,
DEBRA'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

00:03.933 --> 00:05.333
MAY I TAKE A MESSAGE?

00:05.367 --> 00:06.533
CINDY?

00:06.567 --> 00:07.900
ALL RIGHT.

00:07.933 --> 00:09.067
ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

00:09.100 --> 00:11.033
WELL, NO,
DEBRA WENT OUT TONIGHT.

00:11.067 --> 00:12.400
AND RAYMOND DID TOO.

00:12.433 --> 00:15.133
ALTHOUGH THEY WENT
TO DIFFERENT PLACES

00:15.167 --> 00:18.767
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.367
DO YOU THINK THAT SEEMS ODD?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.667
I MEAN,
IT SEEMS ODD TO ME.

00:23.700 --> 00:28.000
I MEAN, DO YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES?

00:28.033 --> 00:29.200
YOU'RE NOT?

00:29.233 --> 00:33.067
OH, WELL, I HAVE
ANOTHER SON, ROBBIE.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.400
OH, I'LL TELL HIM
YOU CALLED.

00:36.433 --> 00:37.867
ALL RIGHT, DEAR.
BYE-BYE.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.667
- HI, MARIE.
WHO WAS THAT?

00:39.700 --> 00:41.233
- THAT'S FOR ROBBIE.

00:43.033 --> 00:44.467
SO HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

00:44.500 --> 00:46.600
- OH, IT WAS JUST
A GREAT LECTURE.

00:46.633 --> 00:48.967
I LEARNED SO MUCH
ABOUT THE AMAZON.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.267
LINDA'S COUSIN
WROTE THIS BOOK,

00:50.300 --> 00:51.700
AND HE'S
A TERRIFIC SPEAKER.

00:51.733 --> 00:52.833
HOW WERE THE KIDS?

00:52.867 --> 00:54.633
- OH, THEY'RE FINE.

00:54.667 --> 00:57.133
THEY DON'T KNOW.

00:57.167 --> 00:58.567
- KNOW WHAT?

00:58.600 --> 01:02.167
- ABOUT YOU AND RAYMOND GOING
YOUR SEPARATE WAYS TONIGHT.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.800
- OH, NO, MARIE,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

01:03.833 --> 01:05.267
RAY DIDN'T WANT TO COME
TO THE BOOKSTORE,

01:05.300 --> 01:06.567
SO HE JUST DID WHAT HE WANTED.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.033
- OH, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALL AN "OPEN MARRIAGE."

01:12.067 --> 01:13.133
- COME ON, MARIE.

01:13.167 --> 01:15.000
I MEAN, YOU GO OUT WITHOUT FRANK
ONCE IN A WHILE.

01:15.033 --> 01:19.433
- THAT'S NOT OPEN MARRIAGE.
THAT'S ESCAPE.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.733
- NO, NO, I MEAN, COME ON.
HOW DO YOU GET A RASH THERE?

01:21.767 --> 01:24.767
- WELL...

01:24.800 --> 01:26.333
- HEY, WE'RE BACK.

01:26.367 --> 01:29.667
- THANK GOD HE CAME BACK.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.633
- HI, MRS. B.
HI, DEB.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.400
- HEY,
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD TIME?

01:32.433 --> 01:33.567
- WELL,
ASK YOUR HUSBAND.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.033
YOU BEAT HOW MANY PEOPLE
IN A ROW AT AIR HOCKEY?

01:35.067 --> 01:36.200
- 11.
- 11.

01:36.233 --> 01:38.633
WAY TO GO, CUBBY, HUH?

01:38.667 --> 01:40.633
- DEBRA HAD A GOOD TIME
TONIGHT TOO.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.300
- OH.
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.700
HOW WAS IT?
HOW'D YOUR THING GO?

01:43.733 --> 01:45.667
- OH, I LOVED IT.
HE SIGNED MY BOOK.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.833
- HE.

01:47.867 --> 01:50.100
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
DR. EVERETT MUNCE.

01:50.133 --> 01:53.267
- A DOCTOR.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.533
- HEY, MA, YOU GOT ANY FOOD
OVER AT THE HOUSE?

01:59.567 --> 02:00.500
- WHY?

02:00.533 --> 02:01.733
- WELL,
WE'RE KIND OF STARVING.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.167
- I THOUGHT YOU COULD MAYBE MAKE
SOMETHING FOR ME AND GIANNI.

02:03.200 --> 02:08.300
- I'VE BEEN THINKING OF YOU
IN AN APRON ALL NIGHT, MRS. B.

02:08.333 --> 02:13.133
- WELL, I DO HAVE FOOD,
BUT DON'T YOU NEED ME HERE?

02:13.167 --> 02:15.767
- I DON'T THINK SO.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.600
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

02:18.633 --> 02:22.833
I'M RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
IF YOU NEED TO TALK, RAYMOND.

02:22.867 --> 02:27.633
AND REMEMBER...
I LOVE YOU.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.600
- YOU'RE ON MY FOOT.

02:29.633 --> 02:32.633
- OH.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.133
- WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S WITH MY MOTHER?

02:39.167 --> 02:40.233
- OH,
SHE'S JUST FLIPPING OUT,

02:40.267 --> 02:42.367
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T GO OUT
TOGETHER TONIGHT.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.467
- WHY? YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH THE BOOKSTORE GUY?

02:45.500 --> 02:47.233
- YEAH,
HE'S 60 YEARS OLD,

02:47.267 --> 02:49.767
HAS ONE EYE,
AND SMELLS OF THE JUNGLE.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.300
- YEAH,
THAT'S HOW YOU LIKE IT.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.967
- YEAH.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.300
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.633
AND NEXT WEEK IS THE SECOND PART
OF THE LECTURE.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.433
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU GONNA GO AGAIN?

03:03.467 --> 03:05.267
- YEAH.
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM, IS IT?

03:05.300 --> 03:08.500
- NO, NO, IT'S NO PROBLEM.
IT'S JUST--WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

03:08.533 --> 03:11.000
- OH, I THOUGHT YOU COULD
GO OUT WITH THE GUYS AGAIN.

03:11.033 --> 03:13.433
- OH, YEAH.
YEAH, GREAT.

03:13.467 --> 03:17.300
GREAT.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.900
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, RAY?

03:18.933 --> 03:22.033
- OH, NOTHING.
NOTHING.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.800
- RAY, WHAT IS IT?

03:23.833 --> 03:25.700
- NOTHING. IT'S...
I DON'T KNOW.

03:25.733 --> 03:28.433
GOING OUT WITH THE GUYS--
I MEAN, IT WAS GREAT.

03:28.467 --> 03:31.733
IT WAS FUN.
REALLY, REALLY FUN.

03:31.767 --> 03:32.767
- BUT?

03:32.800 --> 03:35.733
- IT WASN'T SO MUCH FUN.

03:38.933 --> 03:41.133
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN...

03:41.167 --> 03:44.200
SOMETHING ABOUT IT--
SOMETHING WAS MISSING.

03:44.233 --> 03:48.700
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:48.733 --> 03:50.400
YOU MEAN ME?

03:50.433 --> 03:54.900
- NO.

03:54.933 --> 03:58.133
NO.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.400
NO, I WAS...I MEAN,

04:00.433 --> 04:03.167
WE DID THE SAME STUFF
WE ALWAYS DO.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.900
YOU KNOW,
GIANNI WAS DOING HIS THING.

04:04.933 --> 04:06.567
HE DROPS ICE CUBES
IN FRONT OF HIM,

04:06.600 --> 04:08.000
"HEY, LOOK,
AN ESKIMO PEEING."

04:08.033 --> 04:11.567
AND, YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, IT WAS FUNNY,

04:11.600 --> 04:14.467
AND I USED TO LAUGH AT IT,
BUT...

04:14.500 --> 04:16.300
- IT'S LOST ITS MAGIC?

04:16.333 --> 04:17.700
- YEAH.

04:17.733 --> 04:18.567
YEAH.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.100
WE HAD
THE BUFFALO WINGS I'D LIKE,

04:20.133 --> 04:22.467
AND WE DID
THE AIR HOCKEY.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.533
BUT I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING ABOUT IT--

04:24.567 --> 04:27.200
IT'S NOT THE--
IT'S NOT THE SAME AS IT WAS.

04:27.233 --> 04:31.167
- OH, MY GOD.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.333
YOU'RE GROWING UP.

04:38.367 --> 04:40.567
- NO.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.600
NO. I PROBABLY GOT
A FLU OR SOMETHING.

04:42.633 --> 04:45.200
- NO. NO, THAT'S WHY
YOU DON'T LIKE DOING

04:45.233 --> 04:46.867
ALL THOSE STUPID THINGS
YOU USED TO DO.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.133
YOU'RE CHANGING.

04:48.167 --> 04:49.467
YOU'RE MATURING.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.367
NO, IT'S A GOOD THING, RAY.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.567
YOU'VE BECOME A MAN.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.933
YOU KNOW WHY YOU JUST SAID
YOU HAD A BAD TIME

04:57.967 --> 04:59.567
DOING ALL THOSE THINGS?

04:59.600 --> 05:03.167
BECAUSE YOU'VE OUTGROWN THEM.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.567
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT,
DON'T YOU?

05:05.600 --> 05:09.433
- WELL, CRAP,
MAYBE YOU ARE.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.567
OH, MY GOD.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.700
OH.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.200
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.000
COME TO THE LECTURE WITH ME
ON SATURDAY.

05:22.033 --> 05:24.167
- NO. WHAT?
- OH, NO, WAIT, LISTEN.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.333
THAT'S WHAT ADULTS DO.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.000
THEY USE THEIR HEAD,
AND THEY THINK.

05:28.033 --> 05:29.267
OH, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.700
YOU'RE READY FOR THIS.

05:30.733 --> 05:33.067
YOU ARE A MATURE ADULT.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.900
- OKAY.

05:35.933 --> 05:39.600
IT WOULD BE KIND OF COOL
TO SEE A GUY WITH ONE EYE.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.867
- HEY, DEBRA.
- HI.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.533
- HI.
RAY, YOU CAME.

05:49.567 --> 05:50.767
- YEP, I'M HERE.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.033
- YOU LOOK SO NICE.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.233
- DOESN'T HE?

05:53.267 --> 05:55.067
- YES, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LIKE THIS.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.167
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.900
RAYMOND,
LOOK AT YOU.

05:57.933 --> 05:59.133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:59.167 --> 06:00.933
- I JUST CAME TO GET
A LITTLE CULTURE.

06:00.967 --> 06:04.367
- OH,
A LITTLE CULTURE.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.633
- FOLKS,
IF YOU COULD TAKE YOUR SEATS.

06:07.833 --> 06:10.033
- BOY,
THIS IS FUN.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.567
IT'S HIGH SCHOOL,
ONLY NOW,

06:11.600 --> 06:13.167
I'VE HAD SEX WITH THE GIRL
WHO SITS NEXT TO ME.

06:13.200 --> 06:18.500
- OH, SHH.

06:18.533 --> 06:21.000
- LET'S PLEASE ALL WELCOME BACK
TO SIDEWALK BOOKS

06:21.033 --> 06:22.633
DR. EVERETT MUNCE.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.067
[applause]

06:25.100 --> 06:26.333
- THANK YOU, BRIAN.

06:26.367 --> 06:29.933
- WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE
SOME FAMILIAR FACES

06:29.967 --> 06:31.167
BACK FROM LAST WEEK.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.267
I BELIEVE I LEFT YOU
ON THE BANKS OF THE AMAZON

06:35.300 --> 06:39.700
ABOUT 250 KILOMETERS
EAST OF MANAUS.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.133
IF YOU CAN IMAGINE,
IT'S DUSK,

06:43.167 --> 06:45.867
AND IT'S STILL 104 DEGREES.

06:45.900 --> 06:50.667
THE HUMIDITY IS AROUND 99%,
AND YET IT IS NOT RAINING.

06:54.633 --> 06:56.333
IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY,

06:56.367 --> 06:59.100
YOU CAN HEAR THE MACAWS
AND THE CAPYBARAS

06:59.133 --> 07:01.900
AND PERHAPS EVEN
THE LOW GROWL OF A JAGUAR...

07:01.933 --> 07:05.500
NEVER SEEN AN OUTSIDER,
SO ONE'S DILEMMA BECOMES,

07:05.533 --> 07:08.700
"HOW DO I RECORD
THIS AMAZING DISCOVERY

07:08.733 --> 07:12.167
WITHOUT CORRUPTING THE PURITY
OF THEIR EXISTENCE?"

07:12.200 --> 07:15.300
WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

07:15.333 --> 07:20.600
THEY FACED THIS SAME DILEMMA
MORE THAN 30 YEARS AGO

07:20.633 --> 07:22.533
IN THE PHILIPPINES.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.767
I BELIEVE IT WAS
30 YEARS AGO.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.333
YES, IT WAS IN THE PHILIPPINES
WHERE THEY COME UPON A TRIBE

07:28.367 --> 07:31.367
THAT WAS CALLED THE TASADAY.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.667
EVEN THOUGH THEY TOOK GREAT--

07:33.700 --> 07:35.467
- OW! OW! GOD!

07:35.500 --> 07:36.567
WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:36.600 --> 07:38.567
- SHH! WAKE UP.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.667
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M AWAKE.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.233
BUT YOU CAUGHT ME
RIGHT IN THE EYE.

07:41.267 --> 07:42.533
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

07:42.567 --> 07:43.567
- I'M ALL RIGHT.
IT'S JUST--

07:43.600 --> 07:44.967
YOU GOT ME RIGHT
IN THE SOCKET HOLE.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
- BE QUIET.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.233
- ALL RIGHT.
GOD.

07:48.267 --> 07:51.200
YOU COULD'VE POKED MY EYE OUT.

08:03.700 --> 08:09.033
NOT THAT I STILL
WOULDN'T BE A GREAT GUY.

08:10.933 --> 08:12.867
[door opens]

08:12.900 --> 08:13.667
- HI, MARIE.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.167
- HI, DEAR.
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

08:15.200 --> 08:18.900
- IT WAS FINE.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.267
- RAY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:21.300 --> 08:22.800
- NOTHING.
NOTHING, NOTHING.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.567
I GOT POKED IN THE EYE.

08:24.600 --> 08:29.767
YOU KNOW HOW WILD IT CAN GET
IN A BOOKSTORE.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.167
- IT'S NOT FUNNY, RAY.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.200
- I FELL ASLEEP.

08:33.233 --> 08:34.767
THE GUY WAS DRONING
ON AND ON,

08:34.800 --> 08:36.167
AND I FELL ASLEEP.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.400
- SO HE HIT YOU?

08:39.433 --> 08:40.867
- NO.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.100
SHE DID.

08:43.133 --> 08:44.667
- I HAD TO WAKE YOU UP.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.267
- WHEN I WANTED
TO WAKE RAYMOND UP,

08:47.300 --> 08:50.267
I WOULD STROKE HIS HAIR...

08:50.300 --> 08:54.867
AND GENTLY KISS HIS FOREHEAD.

08:54.900 --> 08:59.133
- THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.767
- YOU WERE SLEEPING ON ME
IN PUBLIC.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.167
I HAD TO GET YOU OFF OF ME.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.367
- OH, MY.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.367
I HAD HOPED THAT AFTER YOUR
LITTLE SEPARATION LAST WEEK

09:07.400 --> 09:09.533
THAT MAYBE TONIGHT
WOULD GO BETTER.

09:09.567 --> 09:12.300
- EVERYTHING IS FINE,
MARIE.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.267
- NO, IT'S NOT.
EVERYTHING IS NOT FINE.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.400
- STOP RUBBING IT, ALREADY.
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

09:16.433 --> 09:19.100
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MY EYE.

09:19.133 --> 09:24.300
EVERYTHING IS NOT RIGHT WITH ME,
THE WHOLE ME.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.967
- WHAT?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:27.233 --> 09:30.567
- I WENT TO THAT LECTURE,
AND I TRIED, DEBRA.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.533
GOD HELP ME,
I TRIED TO LIKE IT.

09:33.567 --> 09:37.433
THE ELBOW IN THE EYE
WAS THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT.

09:40.933 --> 09:42.233
- WELL, I'M SORRY.

09:42.267 --> 09:43.633
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN ADULT.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.600
I MADE A MISTAKE.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.333
- WHO THE HELL AM I?

09:47.367 --> 09:48.600
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:48.633 --> 09:51.467
- DON'T YOU SEE?
LAST WEEK, THE SAME THING.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.100
I WENT OUT WITH THE GUYS,
THE SAME THING HAPPENED.

09:53.133 --> 09:54.833
I DIDN'T BELONG THERE,
EITHER.

09:54.867 --> 09:59.067
SO NOW I GOT THIS THING
IN MY HEAD, LIKE, "WHO AM I?

09:59.100 --> 10:03.133
WHAT DO I DO NOW?"

10:03.167 --> 10:05.767
"WHERE THE HELL DO I BELONG?"

10:05.800 --> 10:08.733
- RIGHT HERE.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.067
- YOU'RE ON MY FOOT AGAIN,
MA.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.833
- COME ON.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.200
TRUST ME.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.567
YOU'RE GONNA THANK ME FOR THIS.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.533
HURRY UP.
YOU'RE LETTING THE STEAM OUT.

10:41.433 --> 10:46.200
- HEY, RAY'S HERE.
HA-HA-HA.

10:46.233 --> 10:48.400
- IT'S THE SPORTSWRITER.

10:48.433 --> 10:50.000
- WELCOME TO THE INNER SANCTUM.

10:50.033 --> 10:51.167
- YEAH. HI, GUYS.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.300
I'D SHAKE YOUR HANDS,

10:52.333 --> 10:55.267
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
DROPPING THOSE TOWELS.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.700
- HEY, PUT THAT IN YOUR COLUMN,
SPORTSWRITER.

10:59.733 --> 11:01.833
- RAY'S BEEN GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH,

11:01.867 --> 11:05.767
SO I BROUGHT HIM HERE
TO SWEAT THAT PUSS OFF HIS FACE.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.633
- LET ME TURN UP THE STEAM
FOR YOU, RAY.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.867
- NO, DON'T GET UP.

11:08.900 --> 11:09.933
DON'T GET UP.
NO, PLEASE.

11:09.967 --> 11:12.267
NOBODY MOVE, OKAY?

11:12.300 --> 11:15.200
JUST PRETEND THAT I'M NOT HERE,
OKAY,

11:15.233 --> 11:17.367
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.033
- SAYS THE FUNNY SPORTSWRITER.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.333
- SIT DOWN, RAY.
TAKE A LOAD OFF.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.067
- HEY, SIT RIGHT HERE, RAY.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.233
THAT'S O'NEAL'S PLACE.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.567
BUT YOU CAN SIT THERE.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.533
HE'S DEAD.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.500
- AH, I LOVE THE LODGE.

11:34.533 --> 11:38.267
WE PLAY SOME CARDS,
WE GET SOMETHING TO EAT,

11:38.300 --> 11:40.767
WE COME IN HERE AND RELAX.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.667
- WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR?

11:42.700 --> 11:43.867
- HAIR.

11:43.900 --> 11:47.033
- YEAH,
I COULD ASK FOR HAIR.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.600
OY.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.067
- OH, MAN.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.133
HOW LONG CAN YOU GUYS STAY
IN HERE?

11:55.167 --> 11:58.433
- WELL, THE RECORD IS
4 HOURS AND 10 MINUTES.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.500
- YEAH ,BY WHO?

11:59.533 --> 12:02.067
- O'NEAL.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.433
- THIS IS THE LIFE.

12:07.467 --> 12:11.267
- YEAH,
LIKE OIL IN THE JOINTS.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.567
- YOU STILL STIFF?

12:12.600 --> 12:13.900
- IN MY KNEE.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.967
- YEAH.
I GOT THAT.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.900
- MY BACK'S STILL ACTING UP.

12:18.933 --> 12:20.033
- OH, THE TWINGE?

12:20.067 --> 12:21.700
- ON GOOD DAYS,
IT'S A TWINGE.

12:21.733 --> 12:24.600
- YEAH.
I GOT THAT.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.533
- I GOT, LIKE,
A SHOULDER THING.

12:32.567 --> 12:33.533
- YEAH?

12:33.567 --> 12:34.733
- IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S JUST--

12:34.767 --> 12:36.733
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES WHEN I LIFT THINGS UP,

12:36.767 --> 12:38.533
YOU KNOW, IT HURTS.

12:38.567 --> 12:41.033
- YOU MEAN UP HERE BETWEEN
THE NECK AND THE SHOULDER BLADE?

12:41.067 --> 12:42.867
- YEAH, YEAH,
IT'S, LIKE, A KNOT.

12:42.900 --> 12:43.867
- I KNOW.

12:43.900 --> 12:46.100
I GOT THAT.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.633
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LIFTING THINGS, RAY?

12:48.667 --> 12:49.733
- AH, YOU KNOW, DEBRA--

12:49.767 --> 12:52.467
SHE'S GOT ME DOING THIS
AND DOING THAT.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.133
- OH, THE WIVES.

12:54.167 --> 12:57.833
- THAT'S A PAIN
WE CAN'T GET RID OF.

12:57.867 --> 13:00.433
- UNTIL YOU'RE O'NEAL.

13:00.467 --> 13:01.900
[laughter]

13:01.933 --> 13:03.000
- PUT THAT IN YOUR COLUMN.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.567
- I SHOULD.
I SHOULD.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.100
I SHOULD PUT IT IN.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.500
I GOT UP TWICE LAST NIGHT
TO PEE.

13:21.533 --> 13:25.767
[together] OH...YEAH.
OH.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.733
- AT LEAST YOU GOT UP.

13:39.933 --> 13:41.767
- DEBRA, I'M GONNA PUT
RAYMOND'S CANNOLIS

13:41.800 --> 13:42.833
IN YOUR REFRIGERATOR.

13:42.867 --> 13:43.767
- ALL RIGHT.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.633
- MA, WHY CAN'T I JUST
GRAB ONE OF THOSE?

13:45.667 --> 13:46.633
- NO, ROBBIE.

13:46.667 --> 13:49.567
I MADE IT ESPECIALLY FOR RAYMOND
TO CHEER HIM UP.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.200
- SO HE GETS TEN CANNOLIS,
AND I GET NONE?

13:52.233 --> 13:54.133
- HE'S HAVING A LIFE CRISIS.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.667
- [scoffs]
LIFE CRISIS...

13:55.700 --> 13:57.200
WHEN I GOT DIVORCED,
I HAD TO BEG YOU

13:57.233 --> 13:59.500
FOR A PIECE OF RAISIN TOAST.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.200
- OH, THERE HE IS.

14:04.233 --> 14:06.533
HOW WAS IT, DEAR?
DID YOU HAVE A NICE TIME?

14:06.567 --> 14:09.033
- YOU KNOW, I DID.
I REALLY DID.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.267
- WAS I RIGHT,
OR WAS I RIGHT?

14:11.300 --> 14:13.300
THE LODGE IS HEAVEN ON EARTH.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.433
- I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
THAT STEAM ROOM--

14:14.467 --> 14:16.967
THAT WAS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.033
- AW, THAT'S GREAT, HONEY.

14:18.067 --> 14:19.567
I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE
TO RELAX.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.500
- YES, THE STEAM ROOM
MUST HAVE BEEN NICE.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.667
I'VE NEVER BEEN INVITED
TO THE LODGE.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.133
BUT THAT'S OKAY;
I CAN ALWAYS WORK UP A SWEAT

14:26.167 --> 14:29.567
BY CHASING A PSYCHOPATH
DOWN THE SUBWAY TRACK.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.567
- YOU KNOW, RAY,
YOU FIT RIGHT IN.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.200
I WAS WORRIED YOU WERE GONNA
SAY SOMETHING STUPID...

14:39.233 --> 14:41.667
OR LIBERAL.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.167
- I ACTUALLY LIKED
TALKING TO THOSE GUYS.

14:44.200 --> 14:49.433
- WELL, THAT'S TERRIFIC.
HAVE TEN CANNOLIS.

14:49.467 --> 14:50.500
- OH, I FORGOT.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.033
I MADE YOU A SPECIAL TREAT.
RAYMOND.

14:52.067 --> 14:53.800
SIT DOWN.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.100
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, RAY?

14:55.133 --> 14:57.033
YOU GONNA JOIN THE BROTHERHOOD?

14:57.067 --> 14:59.033
THE GUYS SAY
YOU'D BE A SHOO-IN.

14:59.067 --> 15:01.633
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:01.667 --> 15:04.633
YEAH,
I THINK I WOULD LIKE THAT.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.233
- WAIT A MINUTE.

15:06.267 --> 15:08.800
YOU WANT TO JOIN THE LODGE?

15:08.833 --> 15:10.567
- IT'LL BE GREAT.

15:10.600 --> 15:15.267
I'LL BE YOUR FATHER,
BUT I'LL ALSO BE YOUR BROTHER.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.700
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!

15:17.733 --> 15:21.467
- NO! ROBBIE, ROBBIE!
ROBBIE! ROBBIE!

15:21.500 --> 15:24.067
ROBBIE, GIVE IT TO ME.
OH, ROBBIE.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.433
OH, ROBBIE.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.800
OH, ROBBIE.

15:27.833 --> 15:32.833
OH, STOP THAT.

15:32.867 --> 15:33.833
- RAY, COME ON.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.800
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME THERE TODAY,

15:35.833 --> 15:37.900
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO JOIN.

15:37.933 --> 15:39.300
- WHY WOULDN'T HE?

15:39.333 --> 15:42.467
BECAUSE HE'S NOT 100...

15:45.067 --> 15:48.233
PERCENT SURE
HE WANTS TO JOIN.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.633
- NO, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, DEBRA,

15:50.667 --> 15:51.533
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.800
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS IN
THAT STEAM ROOM,

15:53.833 --> 15:55.767
IT JUST FELT RIGHT.

15:55.800 --> 15:59.767
I MEAN, I--I THINK IT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.733
- SWEATY MAN-BOOBS?

16:12.100 --> 16:15.233
- I DON'T LIKE THAT,
ROBERT.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.767
- I MEAN, I WAS COMFORTABLE.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.100
YOU KNOW,
I WAS RELAXED.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.333
I WAS HAPPY.

16:22.367 --> 16:24.967
- PLUS, I'VE GOT SAY,
EVERYONE TOLD ME YOU WERE,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.733
LIKE,
THE BEST-LOOKING GUY IN THERE.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.100
- OF COURSE HE WAS.

16:30.133 --> 16:33.467
HE'S THE "BEFORE"
IN A ROOM FULL OF "AFTERS."

16:36.900 --> 16:37.967
- IS THAT WHAT IT IS, RAY?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.567
IT JUST MADE YOU FEEL YOUNG
TO BE AROUND THOSE GUYS?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.767
- NO, I ACTUALLY FELT
LIKE I BELONGED.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.567
- OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.800
- WELL, I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME TO GROW UP.

16:47.833 --> 16:50.867
- I DIDN'T SAY
GROW ALL THE WAY UP.

16:50.900 --> 16:54.667
I MEAN, WHAT IS THE APPEAL,
JUST SITTING IN A STEAM ROOM?

16:54.700 --> 16:56.433
- OH, WE ALSO PLAY CARDS.

16:56.467 --> 16:59.333
AND DON'T FORGET
THE NAKED SWIMMING.

16:59.367 --> 17:04.933
- I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN,
AND I CAN'T FORGET.

17:04.967 --> 17:06.467
- NO, NO.
LET ME TELL YOU.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.900
AFTER THAT STEAM,
A COUPLE OF NUDE LAPS...

17:09.933 --> 17:12.700
WHOO.

17:12.733 --> 17:15.667
YOU REALLY FEEL THE POOL.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.700
- COME ON, RAY.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

17:17.733 --> 17:19.367
YOU DON'T WANT
TO JOIN THE LODGE.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.867
- WELL, LOOK,
I TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE, RIGHT?

17:21.900 --> 17:23.167
I WENT OUT WITH MY FRIENDS.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.167
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.767
I DIDN'T LIKE
THE BOOKSTORE THING.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.500
I MEAN,
THIS IS ALL I HAVE LEFT.

17:28.533 --> 17:29.467
- NO, IT ISN'T.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.133
I MEAN,
WE DO THINGS TOGETHER.

17:31.167 --> 17:32.167
WE GO OUT.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
WE GO TO DINNER.
WE GO TO THE MOVIES.

17:34.233 --> 17:35.500
- I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
YOU KNOW,

17:35.533 --> 17:39.567
SOME OF THOSE MOVIES WE SEE,
THEY'RE ALL KIND OF STUPID.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.867
- THE LAST MOVIE I SAW
WAS PATTON.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.267
- ALL RIGHT, FRANK.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.533
- AND YOU KNOW WHEN I'LL GO BACK
TO THE MOVIES?

17:45.567 --> 17:49.767
"SON OF PATTON."

17:49.800 --> 17:51.967
- AND THEN EVERYBODY
IS ALWAYS TALKING IN THEM,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.700
AND IT'S ALWAYS FREEZING.

17:54.733 --> 17:59.200
- IN FACT, IS THERE, LIKE,
A DRAFT IN HERE?

17:59.233 --> 18:01.567
- THERE'S A BLANKET
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.133
MAYBE YOU'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE
IN THERE.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.533
- WELL,
I AM A LITTLE TIRED.

18:06.567 --> 18:09.233
OHH, GOSH.

18:09.267 --> 18:11.500
OH, MY SHOULDER'S
ON THE FRITZ AGAIN.

18:11.533 --> 18:13.933
- JUST SIT DOWN
AND PUT YOUR FEET UP.

18:13.967 --> 18:17.000
- YES, RAYMOND.
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

18:17.033 --> 18:19.600
SOME MELBA TOAST?

18:19.633 --> 18:22.067
A CATHETER?

18:25.500 --> 18:28.067
- I'M ALL LOCKED UP, YOU KNOW.
IT'S LIKE A BIG KNOT.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.267
- IS IT IN HERE?

18:29.300 --> 18:31.533
- YOU NEED MORE TIME
IN THAT STEAM ROOM.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.933
I'LL PICK YOU UP
TOMORROW MORNING AT 9:00.

18:33.967 --> 18:39.267
WE DON'T COME OUT
UNTIL EVERYTHING'S SOFT.

18:39.300 --> 18:42.433
- I MAY THROW UP.

18:47.667 --> 18:50.300
- WE GOT--DO WE HAVE, LIKE,
A HEATING PAD?

18:50.333 --> 18:52.000
- WELL, THIS IS GREAT, RAY.

18:52.033 --> 18:53.367
THIS IS JUST GREAT.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.800
YOU WENT FROM
AN IMMATURE TEENAGER

18:54.833 --> 18:58.933
TO A TIRED OLD GEEZER
WITH NO STOPS IN BETWEEN.

18:58.967 --> 19:00.567
AND WHAT DID I GET?

19:00.600 --> 19:02.667
I GOT RIPPED OFF.
THAT'S WHAT I GOT.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.767
I NEVER GOT TO BE MARRIED
TO A MAN,

19:04.800 --> 19:07.767
A REGULAR, GROWN-UP MAN.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.333
- DO YOU HAVE TO YELL?

19:10.367 --> 19:12.633
- COULD EVERYBODY
PLEASE LEAVE NOW?

19:12.667 --> 19:14.933
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I JUST NEED EVERYONE TO GO.

19:14.967 --> 19:17.300
- YEAH, BUT--
- MARIE, PLEASE GO.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.067
- DEBRA, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
TURN HIM EVERY HALF HOUR

19:19.100 --> 19:22.133
SO HE DOESN'T GET BEDSORES.

19:22.167 --> 19:23.133
- ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT--

19:23.167 --> 19:26.300
- MARIE, HE'LL BE FINE.

19:41.933 --> 19:43.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:43.333 --> 19:46.667
- I'M JUST CHECKING TO SEE
HOW OLD YOU REALLY ARE.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.267
WELL?

19:58.300 --> 20:00.700
- I'M A LITTLE TIRED.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.200
- OH, MY GOD.

20:02.233 --> 20:06.167
- BUT NOT TOO TIRED.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.333
- I THOUGHT
YOUR SHOULDER HURT.

20:07.367 --> 20:10.200
- I'M NOT GONNA USE MY SHOULDER.

20:31.833 --> 20:34.533
- THANKS FOR GIVING ME
A SHOT HERE, DAD.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.067
- YEAH, YEAH.
TAKE IT EASY.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.833
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S THE BIG ONE.

20:39.867 --> 20:42.567
- HEY, GUYS.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.300
- HEY, ROBERT.

20:46.333 --> 20:49.567
- YOU'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE,
ROBERT.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.700
I GUESS YOU DON'T EAT
TOO MANY DOUGHNUTS.

20:51.733 --> 20:53.800
[laughter]

20:53.833 --> 20:57.333
- 'CAUSE COPS EAT DOUGHNUTS.

20:57.367 --> 20:58.300
- OKAY.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.833
- SO YOUR WIFE
IS GONNA LET YOU JOIN?

21:00.867 --> 21:02.133
- ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT MARRIED.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.500
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
GUYS, RED ALERT.

21:04.533 --> 21:07.767
- WE'RE SITTING NAKED
WITH A CONFIRMED BACHELOR.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.133
- HA-HA-HA-HA-HA.

21:10.167 --> 21:11.400
- LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.

21:11.433 --> 21:13.667
I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.567
- HEY, ROBERT,
IT'S HOT IN HERE.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.600
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR SWEATER OFF?

21:17.633 --> 21:21.733
[laughter]

21:21.767 --> 21:23.567
- GOOD ONE.
GOOD ONE.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.033
[laughs]

21:25.067 --> 21:27.467
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR WIG OFF?

21:29.200 --> 21:32.267
- NOW, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

21:32.300 --> 21:35.967
- N-NOTHING.
I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.600
- YOU'RE JUST A WISE GUY,
I SEE.

21:37.633 --> 21:39.933
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

21:39.967 --> 21:42.433
TAKE IT EASY,
TAKE IT EASY.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.500
- WHAT DID I DO?

21:43.533 --> 21:45.000
- JUST KEEP MOVING.
- BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

21:45.033 --> 21:46.367
- FRANK, GET HIM OUT OF HERE,
FRANK.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.467
- COME ON. COME ON.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.633
- BRING BACK THE FUNNY ONE.
