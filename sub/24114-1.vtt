WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:10.051
The adventure begins.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.761
<i>Last season on You Me Her...</i>

00:12.512 --> 00:14.431
You do remember
we're having everybody over

00:14.514 --> 00:15.557
for the game tomorrow, right?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.684
The point is...
are you bringing Izzy?

00:17.767 --> 00:20.520
This is our choice,
and this is what we want.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.189
-Let's do it.
We have some very exciting news.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.774
We're together! We're a throuple.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.694
So, you quit escorting. For Andy.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.572
So, you're seriously falling for him?

00:30.655 --> 00:32.365
I'm scared shitless. I can't sleep.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.867
Think they even noticed
that we left?

00:33.950 --> 00:36.286
Y
You think she's just, like, gay?

00:36.369 --> 00:37.495
Are you mad?

00:37.579 --> 00:39.748
Who doesn't love
a spirited public cuckolding?

00:39.831 --> 00:42.208
You start work
in 47 minutes. That's at noon.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.502
You can't fulfill the duties
of a skilled bartender

00:44.586 --> 00:46.254
-when you're highly inebriated.

00:46.337 --> 00:47.922
-One more.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.384
Coolest firm in Seattle.
Thanks so much, Kylie.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.802
I don't even know what to say.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.971
Everyone at Pinnacle
is buzzing about me.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.348
Have you crossed into
seriously considering this?

00:57.432 --> 00:58.767
So, Scary Nina?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.518
I know it's fast, but yeah.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.438
-I see you, Nina Martone.
-He's a love junkie.

01:03.521 --> 01:04.647
That... That's his shit?

01:04.731 --> 01:05.732
That's his shit.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.984
How about we start
with a conversation?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.612
-We want you to have our baby.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.989
Like, <i>our</i> baby. All three of us.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.201
I feel like I've just been
drifting along and playing along.

01:16.284 --> 01:20.288
And I woke up in the middle of my life,
no fucking clue who I am or what I want.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.790
The house
at Hawthorne Heights

01:21.873 --> 01:24.042
is always gonna just be
Jack and Emma's.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.377
-It's ours if we want it.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.421
Nobody can make this place look
cooler than Emma, right?

01:30.006 --> 01:31.633
I'm a romantic.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.677
-I see you, Andy Cutler.
-Wait.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.516
We have an appointment to discuss
other options, today at 4:00.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.642
Remember what you said to me?

01:40.725 --> 01:42.602
How you're not sure about
anything in your life

01:42.685 --> 01:44.062
sexually, professionally, or...

01:44.145 --> 01:46.397
-Jack wants a baby.

01:46.481 --> 01:49.818
<i>-Jack</i> wants a baby.
I need you guys to want it, too.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.529
-'Cause if you don't, there's no reason--
-Jack.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.405
I do.

-It's really happening.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.227
Mm-hmm.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.748
It was a bright and cheery
spring morning in Portland,

03:26.831 --> 03:29.208
the perfect day for fresh starts.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.336
Or was it?

03:31.419 --> 03:35.548
For brilliant and obscenely handsome
psychologist Jack Trakarsky,

03:35.632 --> 03:38.551
nothing would ever
be bright and cheery again.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.136
That's the worst
<i>Dateline</i> impression ever.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.554
-Okay, no peeking.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.224
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.981
Okay, voilà.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.858
The piece de resistance.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.735
Wow.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.946
I know it's not what
she would've done,

03:58.029 --> 04:00.698
but, uh, I was inspired.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.076
I love it.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.288
You hate it. You totally hate it,
and I-I get it. I went...

04:07.372 --> 04:09.582
-I went far with the... with the birds...
-Babe.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.167
...and the yellow
and the ahh, and the...

04:11.251 --> 04:12.210
-Babe.
-I get it.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.170
I said I love it.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.755
And I love you.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.092
Mm.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.680
Good, 'cause I couldn't
take one more day in her house,

04:23.763 --> 04:25.390
surrounded by her shit and her friends

04:25.473 --> 04:27.684
with their catty
little home-wrecker glares.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.603
Maybe there's a little paranoia
in play here?

04:30.687 --> 04:33.690
Mm, I'm acutely self-aware,
so hold on...

04:35.775 --> 04:37.360
Nope, I'm good.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.703
-Yep.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.207
Want to actually talk about it,
or is that still too radical?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.376
For the millionth time,
I'm fine, okay?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.336
It's water under the bridge.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.131
It's water off a duck's back.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.633
-It's water--
-Oh, my God, stop.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.010
-I get it.
-Yep.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.013
You're a rolling river of fineness.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.639
But you have postponed
the signing twice,

05:06.723 --> 05:09.225
so it's fair of me to wonder
if there's something else going on...

05:09.309 --> 05:11.519
Iz, can we literally talk
about anything else?

05:12.020 --> 05:12.895
Please?

05:13.521 --> 05:14.772
Fine.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.485
What if, um...

05:28.619 --> 05:31.497
What if you have
a substantial estate

05:31.581 --> 05:33.666
and we were newly married?

05:33.958 --> 05:39.213
But I have a secret past
littered with rich, dead husbands?

05:39.547 --> 05:41.549
Which, by the way,
I've never once denied.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.344
We're playing <i>Dateline,</i> with an accent.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.556
First...

05:48.973 --> 05:54.479
I'd lull you into complacency
with my insidious sexuality.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.563
Mm-hmm.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.358
Oh.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.613
-Cause of death: phallic hypothermia.
-Oh, dear.

06:03.696 --> 06:07.700
Was the adoring doctoral candidate
with the cold hands

06:07.784 --> 06:09.786
hiding an even colder heart?

06:10.995 --> 06:12.497
Seriously, you should
see a doctor about this.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.666
One more word about my hands,
and I will seriously <i>Dateline</i> you.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.509
So, you like the wallpaper? -Yeah.
-Okay, good.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.930
-It was really expensive.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.432
I used your credit card.
I hope that's okay.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.060
Honey?
Yeah?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.645
Please tell me
you hid my shirts

06:35.728 --> 06:38.106
like it's some sort of
a fun joke to play on Dave.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.400
Otherwise, this is the only shirt
that I have left to wear.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.361
Uh, crazy day yesterday.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.321
Honey, I need you
to look at me for a second.

06:45.404 --> 06:46.739
Can I just assume
that you're wearing

06:46.823 --> 06:48.783
a ridiculously wrinkled shirt
to hammer home a point

06:48.866 --> 06:50.827
with your trademark subtlety?

06:50.910 --> 06:54.038
Okay, I cannot wear a T-shirt and blazer
for the fourth straight day, all right?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.957
I don't wanna be the T-shirt
and blazer guy.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.167
-Say, here's an idea;

06:58.251 --> 07:00.753
how about this evening,
when you're driving directly past

07:00.837 --> 07:02.797
the dry cleaners
with zero screaming children in the car,

07:02.880 --> 07:04.966
you hang a Louie
and pick up your own shirts, cool?

07:05.049 --> 07:06.968
Okay, the smile that launched
a thousand nightmares.

07:07.051 --> 07:10.972
Okay, so, do it myself, hang a Louie,
dry cleaning, got it, okay. Great.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.765
Sorry, I'm just a little overwhelmed.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.934
That's fine. That's fine.
It's just, uh, you know,

07:15.017 --> 07:17.770
is it possible that the amount
of whelm that you're feeling

07:17.854 --> 07:20.064
is due in part to the magazine thing?

07:21.065 --> 07:24.318
You think you could call it the magazine
and not "the magazine thing"

07:24.402 --> 07:26.612
like it's super cute and not at all real?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.990
Are we fighting, 'cause
I don't know what's... happening. Well, let's review.
I was feeding our two young children

07:31.451 --> 07:33.369
when you entered,
complaining about the dry cleaning

07:33.453 --> 07:35.580
while wearing a shirt I've been using
to clean the windows

07:35.663 --> 07:38.666
-for the past five years.
-That explains why my chest is itchy.

07:38.749 --> 07:39.709
What?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.173
Dave, this matters to me.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.593
Okay? It's not a full-time job,
but it's not a hobby, either.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.553
-Okay. I know.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.889
And I support you 100%.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.056
-Thank you.

07:54.891 --> 07:58.728
It's just that while you're doing
those amazing things out in the world,

07:58.811 --> 08:02.482
you know, you got to also be here,
you know what I mean?

08:03.107 --> 08:04.484
Be here?

08:05.026 --> 08:08.029
Yeah, metaphorically speaking.
I didn't... I don't mean...

08:08.112 --> 08:10.031
Like, I'm not forbidding you
from leaving the house.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.032
Oh, no.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.409
Not that I would do that, if I...
if given the option.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.827
Not that I would take the--
Okay.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.997
This is going downhill faster than
an Olympic luger. Lugist?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.124
Here's what I mean. Look.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.919
-Mm, mm.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.545
Okay, it sounded wise
in my head, but...

08:24.629 --> 08:26.923
-Can't imagine why.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:27.507 --> 08:32.428
Okay, I'm gonna go... pick out a T-shirt
and blazer combination.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.431
-I think that might be fun to try. Great.
-There you go.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.643
Okay, so far I've got

08:38.726 --> 08:42.188
<i>True Crime: Is Serial Killer</i>
<i>The New Rock Star?</i> Or

08:42.271 --> 08:44.941
<i>Fake News Therapy:</i>
<i>Lie Me to Sleep.</i>

08:48.152 --> 08:49.153
Hello?

08:50.154 --> 08:52.281
Oh. Thesis titles.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.407
-Yeah.
-Right.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.077
-Lay 'em on me.
-I just did.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.163
Then I love the middle one.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.540
Of... two.

09:00.873 --> 09:01.832
I'm sorry.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.252
I'm having trouble getting Jack

09:04.335 --> 09:07.421
to talk about Emma
without using the word "fine".

09:08.172 --> 09:10.424
What he's really feeling
is gonna fester,

09:10.508 --> 09:13.761
and, you know, then it's gonna
turn into whatever happens

09:13.844 --> 09:15.972
when feelings fester.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.642
It's, like, emotional pus.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.978
-Thanks for that.
-Sorry.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.313
Okay, look, dudes deal differently.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.066
Eventually, he's gonna
get drunk and cry ugly

09:27.149 --> 09:29.485
and punch a wall or whatever.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.904
You seriously need to stop
worrying about the Trakarskys

09:31.988 --> 09:34.490
and start sorting your own shit,
specifically your thesis

09:34.574 --> 09:37.577
and rapidly approaching
grown-up career.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.663
-I need a plan.
-Yeah, no shit.

09:40.746 --> 09:45.418
Some way to get the two of them
alone in an enclosed space.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.046
Okay. You know what?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.215
Think I'm just gonna...

09:51.591 --> 09:54.594
just get up real slow,

09:55.428 --> 09:58.598
walk away, see if you notice

09:59.432 --> 10:01.434
or care at all...

10:02.226 --> 10:04.020
I'm just gonna go...

10:09.066 --> 10:10.985
-Ow!
-Same spot, every day

10:11.068 --> 10:14.447
-until you pitch me your thesis! Ow!
-Ow!

10:15.448 --> 10:17.908
Your therapy techniques
are fucking weird.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.122
Hm, this is a nice surprise.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.999
I wish the weather
would've cooperated.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.543
What's with the '80s
Michael J. Fox ensemble?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.421
Yeah, that is a story
about dry cleaning, my friend.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.299
-No. Actually, I'll pass.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.259
I got to tell you,
Lori moving out

10:35.343 --> 10:37.428
and this Hannah person moving in
has turned out to be

10:37.511 --> 10:40.056
the worst possible sequence
of events. I mean...

10:41.057 --> 10:43.934
-No, look how cute she is.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.062
-...dare throw that again!
-She's not that cute.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.229
Just a regular child.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.689
Oh.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.609
Look at that.
What an arm you have on you.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.778
Good throw. Here you go.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.988
Oh, you got to make sure
she doesn't throw a curveball

10:56.072 --> 10:57.990
before high school, otherwise
the tendons in the elbow will get all... all screwed up.

11:00.076 --> 11:04.372
-And this one, I just want to eat her up.
-Okay, then, we're just gonna go.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.457
You can never be too careful, right?
Stranger danger?

11:06.540 --> 11:08.584
I sound a little too creepy,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.211
-but I'm not.
-Yeah. Bye.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.213
Make sure you clean that binky.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.257
-I have some wipes if you want--
-Okay. All right, they're gone.

11:15.341 --> 11:19.887
They're gone. See how she's fleeing
from your biological clock?

11:20.429 --> 11:21.764
They just had someplace to go.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.183
You just... You don't say,
"I'm not creepy," by the way.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.102
That makes you sound creepy.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.105
Hey, speaking of fleeing from things,
you got your divorce signing on Monday.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.606
You want to talk about that?

11:31.899 --> 11:33.067
Did Izzy get to you, too?

11:33.692 --> 11:34.693
No.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.074
Yes. But I mean, I happen to think
she has a valid point in this situation.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.328
Okay, you know what?
Tell her you tried.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.249
Nice try, but, uh... I'm good.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.834
Whatever, okay?

11:49.917 --> 11:51.001
Okay.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.255
-We still on for Game 1 on Saturday...
-Yes.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.842
...at your place with the yard and the
sidewalk that doesn't smell like urine?

11:57.925 --> 11:59.051
Slight change of plans.

11:59.135 --> 12:02.054
I would actually like to be away
from kids for the day,

12:02.138 --> 12:04.598
and you're the only one that doesn't
have any, so...

12:04.682 --> 12:05.850
-Sorry...

12:05.933 --> 12:06.976
Gabe's coming, by the way. -Oh, I love Gabe.
-Yeah.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.146
-Love Gabe.
-Said no one ever.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.397
Yeah.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.858
Does your biological clock
have an alarm?

12:13.941 --> 12:14.859
-No, but...

12:14.942 --> 12:17.361
I set this for every 15 minutes,

12:17.445 --> 12:19.822
you know, just in case
I need to get out

12:19.905 --> 12:23.075
of a particularly annoying conversation,
like, you know.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.494
Then I can be like,
"Hey, sorry, I got a place to be.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.121
-Got an appointment."
-Yeah.

12:27.204 --> 12:30.166
So I do actually have something to do.
I have an appointment.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.917
Oh, bravo, yeah, I get it, okay.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.294
-Okay.
-Yeah.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.296
Stop conspiring
with my girlfriend, okay?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.797
-You're headed for a fall...
-Yep.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.883
-...Trakarsky, that's all I'm saying.
-I can't hear you.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.010
My biological clock is deafening.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.893
-I'm sorry, Hannah.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.978
Sorry. Rough morning.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.149
This is still weird for me.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.233
How's that?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.068
Oh, it's, uh, Lori's house.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.280
It's cool now, but effortlessly cool,
kind of like you.

13:01.363 --> 13:02.531
Ha, please.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.033
If you'd seen me
eight hours ago,

13:04.116 --> 13:06.660
Swiffering, bingeing Adult Swim

13:06.744 --> 13:09.705
with nothing but a tumbler
of micro batch bourbon

13:09.788 --> 13:11.582
to keep me company?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.167
It's like you can't even help it.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.835
-Okay, Cal.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.795
Pitch me your best idea.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.298
Poo!

13:19.381 --> 13:21.800
Awesome. Liking it.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.136
What about poop?
A lot of poop stories out there.

13:25.721 --> 13:28.140
Just want to flush it out,
get back to me?

13:28.224 --> 13:30.017
Yeah? Awesome.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.563
Okay, about
your rough morning...

13:34.647 --> 13:37.233
Oh, yeah, Dave was being a bit of a--

13:37.775 --> 13:39.652
-Mm.
-Damn.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.195
Damn.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.863
So committed.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.991
Oh, I think every part of you
is touching every part of me.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.786
Mm. You know,
I used to be a toe dipper.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.371
Now I'm a high diver.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.248
It's in my book.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.416
Jesus, you're writing a book, too?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.336
Mm. It's ostensibly
a women's travel guide,

13:57.419 --> 14:00.548
but it's basically about the journey
back to the essential you.

14:02.466 --> 14:05.594
Is it weird that I want
to be you when I grow up?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.054
No, not at all.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.015
So, uh, who watches the boys

14:10.099 --> 14:13.102
when you and Rob are jetting
all over the world?

14:13.185 --> 14:15.437
Uh, well, we have a nanny,

14:15.521 --> 14:18.107
like any reasonable
two-career couple.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.068
Anyway, almost finished
my review on that

14:21.151 --> 14:22.653
Hawthorne repertory shit show,

14:22.736 --> 14:26.031
an apt description,
since it's at least allegedly a play.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.117
Um, you're shredding it?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.370
"Five white suburban women
just discovered xenophobia

14:31.453 --> 14:34.206
and now, they're nobly
educating the rest of us."

14:34.290 --> 14:38.127
So, I am not saying that we have to
wantonly blow every potential advertiser--

14:38.210 --> 14:40.004
Because <i>The Heights</i>
is different, right?

14:40.087 --> 14:42.798
We're not just another
bougie-pandering community rag.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.300
Fuckin' A, sister.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.429
However, the theatre is launching
a huge season-pass campaign,

14:48.512 --> 14:51.432
so we got to go
full deep throat on this one.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.518
There must be something positive
about that play, right?

14:55.102 --> 14:56.520
-There were seats.
-Yeah.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.522
-Ooh.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.441
None of the actors peed herself?

15:00.524 --> 15:02.902
Ah! See? That's right off
the top of your head.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.404
You know, like Rob always says,

15:05.487 --> 15:06.739
"We--"

15:07.573 --> 15:10.075
What

15:11.118 --> 15:13.746
Dave bet me 50 bucks Rob's not real.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.040
-Speaking of Dave...

15:16.123 --> 15:19.376
Have you guys talked about
some version of child care?

15:19.752 --> 15:23.881
I'd say we're more talking
about talking about it.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.258
Look, Carm, I sure as hell
am not going to tell you

15:26.342 --> 15:28.469
how to run your family,
but I am gonna tell you

15:28.552 --> 15:31.639
that we can't publish
almost-finished theatre reviews.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.140
You know what I'm saying, partner?

15:33.974 --> 15:35.225
Yeah.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.708
May I ask why you're pretending
to vomit onto your computer?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.711
Andy is relentlessly posting
photos of him and his dad

16:02.795 --> 16:05.464
having a smile-off
somewhere in the woods.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.091
Sickos.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.301
Say, has anyone ever
written a thesis

16:09.385 --> 16:12.262
about excessive cyberstalking
of ex

16:12.346 --> 16:14.098
You think there's
a clinical name for that or...?

16:14.181 --> 16:16.809
No, but there is a clinical name
for co-workers

16:16.892 --> 16:20.562
who habitually say the stupidest shit
at the worst possible moments.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.731
It's called missing.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.609
You do realize
you don't scare me anymore,

16:25.693 --> 16:28.570
right, 'cause our relationship
has moved way past that.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.989
Oh, do tell.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.992
Well, uh, we're best buds.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.829
<i>Mejores amigos.</i>

16:36.912 --> 16:38.330
Or is it <i>mejores amigas?</i>

16:38.414 --> 16:39.915
What's it when...
when one bestie's female,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.917
-the other one's male...

16:42.001 --> 16:44.128
We're two humans frequently
in the same structure

16:44.211 --> 16:47.172
at the same time who feel compelled
to speak to each other.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.634
-Well, me think the lady doth--
-Men suck.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.636
That's my thesis.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.138
Oh...

16:54.221 --> 16:57.141
Okay, well, I'd recommend
something a little more

16:57.224 --> 16:59.560
smarty-pants, and then...
and then how 'bout some...

16:59.643 --> 17:02.563
<i>-The State of the Millennial Man.</i>

17:02.646 --> 17:05.816
Hm? 20-something dates
in 20-something days,

17:05.899 --> 17:09.236
the whole aimless, emotionally stunted
man

17:09.862 --> 17:12.865
I want to know the hows,
whys, and what nows.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.491
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Jot this one down.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.452
Uh, we're confused.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.872
Thesis written. Huh?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.376
You're welcome. Next.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.795
So what, you're saying it's our fault?
Is that what you're saying?

17:26.879 --> 17:28.380
No. T-The...

17:28.464 --> 17:30.132
No, how did you get that--
Fuck no.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.968
-Hell no. All the nos.
-Boom! Right there. I saw it in your eyes.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.470
You are definitely
still scared of me.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.890
Could you please just...

17:39.183 --> 17:43.270
just clean a glass
or something, you know?

17:55.365 --> 17:59.495
All right, I'm gonna leave you with this
before I do both of our jobs, as usual.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.998
You think men have
spontaneously devolved,

18:03.082 --> 18:05.709
but a lot has changed
in the dating and mating front,

18:05.793 --> 18:07.086
like in leap time.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.213
Lines have blurred,
gender roles are smeared--

18:09.296 --> 18:11.924
Shh. Zip it, okay?
I've got wheels turning, big things.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.843
<i>The Vexing Plight</i>
<i>of the Millennial Male.</i>

18:17.179 --> 18:18.430
That's perfect.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.016
That's definitely not
a rephrasing of what I just said.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.643
It's my break time.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.645
Oh, good for you!
You've worked hard. Thank you.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.899
But when you come back,
we're gonna have a little sit down

18:28.982 --> 18:31.944
and talk about professional boundaries.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.912
Kylie?
-Up here!

18:41.995 --> 18:46.834
<i>♪ Battle lines, battle scars,</i>
<i>tables are turned ♪</i>

18:46.917 --> 18:49.753
<i>♪ On the floor,</i>
<i>nothing left... ♪</i>

18:52.005 --> 18:54.633
What are we celebrating?
I mean, aside from the fact

18:54.716 --> 18:58.137
that we can't seem to go a week
without closing a new project?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.349
Not to sound like a teenage girl,
but it is our two-month anniversary.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.477
Seriously? Two months.
How is that even possible?

19:05.561 --> 19:08.480
One month in college, one month now.
Sue me. I'm a romantic.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.357
Aww, Kylie.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.403
Mm, how awesome are you?

19:14.486 --> 19:17.072
More than your mortal mind
can comprehend.

19:17.948 --> 19:18.907
I got us into Delilah's.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.450
Yeah, what

19:20.534 --> 19:23.245
-In 20 minutes by the window.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.706
Ain't no thing.
I know a guy.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.499
Oh, that is so fucking hot.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.793
The things I'm gonna do to you
when we get home...

19:30.377 --> 19:32.671
Oh, what a shame.
I don't sleep with married women.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.965
-Strict policy.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.134
Oh, you sure about that?

19:37.217 --> 19:42.097
Oh, well, maybe it's not so much
a strict policy as a loose guideline.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.725
And you're single
as of Monday, so...

19:47.436 --> 19:49.188
Sorry, sorry, I...

19:49.271 --> 19:51.815
That was weird, I just...
I just got weird.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.402
We're both in uncharted waters, Em.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.739
You've never been in
a committed relationship

19:58.822 --> 20:01.533
with a woman before,
and I've never been with someone

20:01.617 --> 20:04.077
who was married to a dude
for a million years.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.330
We're good, you're good,
they're good.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.749
And you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

20:17.925 --> 20:18.884
Uh...

20:18.967 --> 20:21.762
Actually, technically, it's your slice,
so you're welcome to it.

20:21.845 --> 20:22.721
Okay.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.306
Wait.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.682
First...

20:27.643 --> 20:30.562
Take another look at how cute
I look in my boyfriend's jersey.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.772
Mm.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.148
Look at the pizza.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.858
Now back up here.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.109
Hello.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.111
-Now back at the pizza.
-Okay.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.697
Now know that you can only have
one of these two things.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.407
Oof.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.659
Hmm.

20:44.159 --> 20:47.037
Are you sexually manipulating me
over the last slice of pizza?

20:47.120 --> 20:50.999
Please, I have chloroformed people
over the last piece of pizza.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.086
-Fine, it's yours.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.879
You're the best.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.883
Mm.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.471
Jack, are you gonna answer it?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.765
What do you think she wants?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.060
Only one way to find out.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.104
Hey, you!

21:12.646 --> 21:14.147
<i>Well, someone's perky.</i>

21:14.231 --> 21:15.315
Are you high?

21:15.399 --> 21:17.943
Yeah, we are super high.

21:18.026 --> 21:21.113
Just dancing,
feeding each other pizza,

21:21.196 --> 21:23.156
generally frolicking.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.783
The uzhe.

21:24.866 --> 21:27.202
Just talk like a normal person.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.912
<i>Well, that's... that's awesome.</i>

21:28.996 --> 21:31.290
Yeah, things are...
things are great here, too.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.793
Um, just scored another big project.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.462
Got back from celebrating
with Kylie at the...

21:37.546 --> 21:41.133
the fanciest restaurant
in the Pacific Northwest, so...

21:41.925 --> 21:44.177
Wow, you go, girl.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.640
I will actually
barf pizza all over your face.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.851
<i>Uh, so, this is a bit</i>
<i>awkward, but you</i>

21:50.934 --> 21:52.436
postponed the last two
scheduled signings,

21:52.519 --> 21:55.147
and I just want to make sure
that we're still on for Monday.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.648
Yep, on for Monday.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.526
Tell Kylie and pop some corks.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.321
Um, well, I will see you then.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.740
Yep, see you then.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.533
Bye, Jack.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.535
Bye, Em.

22:24.176 --> 22:29.264
Jack, you need to stop
whatever the fuck that was

22:29.347 --> 22:32.100
and express some actual,
genuine emotions

22:32.184 --> 22:34.227
about how things went down.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.980
Emma realized she's gay.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.524
End of story.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.610
We want different things,

22:41.985 --> 22:45.113
and it's good that we figured that out
before a baby came into the mix.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.783
And that makes you feel...?

22:48.241 --> 22:51.161
Why is this only about me?
You're... You got left, too.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.624
We were together for, like, a month.
It's hardly the same thing.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.713
Okay, if you were counseling us,
what would you say?

23:01.797 --> 23:03.381
"

23:03.465 --> 23:06.343
-Oh, yeah.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.969
Why is he suddenly
calling you so much?

23:08.053 --> 23:10.847
Well, not really that sudden.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.224
Meaning? Meaning he started calling
a year ago,

23:13.683 --> 23:16.645
ramped it up the last few weeks,
and I don't want to talk about it.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.231
You don't want to talk about it.

23:19.314 --> 23:22.067
You don't see the parallels to the
conversation we were just having?

23:22.150 --> 23:23.610
No.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.612
You're gonna get changed.

23:26.154 --> 23:29.407
Ben Silva's call has just
shaken me in a way

23:29.491 --> 23:31.660
that can only be remedied
by sweating out vodka

23:31.743 --> 23:35.747
in a place that's just, like, uh! Uh!
You know, like, too loud to think.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.916
-Your favourite.
-All right.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.876
Awesome, I am in.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.211
Let's do it!

23:42.587 --> 23:44.005
Again.

23:53.473 --> 23:54.683
Bless you.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.351
You look plagued,
and not with concern.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.687
You look like you literally
have the plague.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.815
The fuck ran into you?
Hey, enjoy.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.442
There's zero chance
he's successfully eating that.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.444
Can't you just tell Izzy
you're too old now

24:06.528 --> 24:09.364
and you can't hang anymore?
There's no shame in that.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.991
-I mean, we already know it.
-Mm-hmm!

24:11.074 --> 24:14.786
I can't take much more of this, you guys.
I'm way closer to 40 than 35.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.246
Or 39, for that matter.

24:16.329 --> 24:19.291
I did shots last night that
were called Death by Dawn.

24:19.374 --> 24:22.377
-The title itself is its own warning.
-More like a prophecy.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.212
She wants to have sex,
like, all the time,

24:24.296 --> 24:26.965
sometimes fucking every day,
twice a day...

24:27.048 --> 24:28.383
Wow, you poor man.

24:28.466 --> 24:31.094
I would slap your face
if you didn't look contagious.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.186
Really going for it.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.274
Does this mean we're not
coming over to watch the game?

24:44.357 --> 24:47.611
What? No. No bailing. We're going
to your loft to watch the fucking game.

24:47.694 --> 24:50.238
Take it easy there, Superfan.
It's the first game of the first round.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.200
You know how many butts
I had to wipe to make this happen?

24:53.283 --> 24:55.202
Seriously hoping it's just the two. We're watching the game, okay?
I need the distraction.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.830
Divorce signing thing
still on for Monday?

25:03.126 --> 25:06.254
You two are literally the last people
in the world I'd want to talk to about it.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.216
Izzy must be hung over too, right?

25:10.383 --> 25:12.594
I mean, she's young,
but she's still human.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.138
-Like it never happened.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.726
One more, we can accidentally
slide into a day rage. Whoo!

25:20.143 --> 25:22.354
Uh, no can do, sister.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.106
I'm enacting a devious plan.

25:25.732 --> 25:28.944
Um, I love devious plans
even more than day raging.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.612
-Tell me.
-I know. Okay.

25:30.695 --> 25:35.075
So, last night, I texted Emma that Jack
and I would be out of the loft all day

25:35.158 --> 25:37.452
so she could come deal with all the shit
we've been storing.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.246
-I left her a key.
-I'm starting to think

25:39.329 --> 25:41.289
you don't actually know
what the word "devious" means.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.291
I'm not done.
And then I recruited Dave -

25:43.375 --> 25:45.669
you know, Jack's weird friend
with all the kids -

25:45.752 --> 25:50.548
to make sure that they would be
in the loft watching the game.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.384
Get it?

25:52.467 --> 25:54.469
I'm getting super fucking
bored over here.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.888
The point is,
is that you know Jack.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.473
He gets so weird.
He's like all chill

25:58.556 --> 26:00.684
and philosophical, but it's,
like, come the fuck on, okay?

26:00.767 --> 26:04.104
If he doesn't let it out, he's gonna
detonate. Like, I can hear him ticking.

26:04.187 --> 26:08.108
Are you sure that's the real reason
behind your "devious plan?" Nyeh.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.320
Seriously? Oh, come on.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.447
Iz, it's me.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.658
Oh, you think I want to get
the band back together?

26:16.741 --> 26:18.994
-Mm-hmm.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.287
How does that even make sense?

26:20.370 --> 26:22.080
Oh, it... it doesn't.
And, um,

26:22.163 --> 26:24.040
while we're discussing
the pervasive senselessness

26:24.124 --> 26:26.751
of your entire life,
have you talked to your dad,

26:26.835 --> 26:28.878
who's been calling
on the hour for several weeks,

26:28.962 --> 26:31.172
or is closure only for other people?

26:32.507 --> 26:34.259
You wrecked my buzz.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.429
Let me guess: headed to the loft?

26:37.512 --> 26:40.932
Oh, you're so cute
when you think you know things and...

26:41.016 --> 26:42.809
Do not go to the loft.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.228
-Bye.
Bye.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.193
Oh, come on, Goldsby!

26:52.277 --> 26:53.945
I think it's time
we cut you off, man.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.947
You're yelling at the TV
like they can hear you.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.615
He heard me.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.367
Look, I managed to go
an entire Saturday

26:59.451 --> 27:01.286
without seeing
or touching a child's puke,

27:01.369 --> 27:03.455
so it's still a win in my books.

27:03.538 --> 27:04.998
So, is this ridiculously small TV

27:05.081 --> 27:07.459
the only thing left to you
in this giant brick box?

27:07.542 --> 27:08.793
Okay, you know what?
Unlike you,

27:08.877 --> 27:12.881
I have a normal, adult-sized penis, so I
don't need a TV the size of a billboard.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.383
Did you steal it from the back seat
of an Escalade, from the headrest?

27:15.467 --> 27:16.634
You just...
...and right there?

27:16.718 --> 27:17.635
He's saying it's small.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.263
-It is very small.
-It is.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.557
Hey, Frank.
Yeah, extra large for pick-up.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.351
Thanks.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.860
Hey, there, Peanut.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.113
You don't get to call me that
anymore, Ben.

27:38.656 --> 27:41.493
-Come on, let's not--
-Go the fuck away.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.707
The sad thing is, you're right.

27:48.083 --> 27:52.045
Now I know how Izzy felt
when she was in Hawthorne Heights.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.090
It's just... I fucking miss the suburbs.
It's pathetic, I know.

27:56.299 --> 27:59.511
It takes me, like, an hour to find
a parking space when I'm driving around.

27:59.594 --> 28:00.804
-That's the worst.
-You poor baby.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.723
Guys, we were not having
this conversation, okay?

28:03.807 --> 28:05.809
W Does she beat you?

28:24.911 --> 28:26.121
Hey.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.331
Hey.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.627
