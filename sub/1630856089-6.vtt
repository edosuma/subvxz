How many of us think that polls

[Queen Mother] I don't see why
we should have to listen to these people.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.000
[Charles] Because we might
actually learn something.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.520
The sample, as I understand it,

society as a whole, isn't it?

06:30.160 --> 06:34.320

06:37.200 --> 06:41.360

06:45.320 --> 06:46.240
Yes.

Only Winston at his height

It's encouraging that our NATO partners

09:59.120 --> 10:01.880
Military success is... quite another.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.440
Every bombing target
has to be approved by committee,

10:05.440 --> 10:08.520

10:08.520 --> 10:12.280
We thought this aerial campaign

Which is why
we ultimately need ground troops.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.280
I proposed to President Clinton
a limited invasion of 80,000 troops,

10:36.280 --> 10:38.480
which would drive Serb forces
out of Kosovo

10:38.480 --> 10:40.840
and create safe havens
for refugees to return,

10:40.840 --> 10:44.520

can't point to Yugoslavia on a map,

10:44.520 --> 10:46.920

10:47.440 --> 10:49.600
- Yes.
- It's most frustrating.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.320
But I won't give up. Morally,

10:54.080 --> 10:55.520
this is the right thing.

[Elizabeth] <i>Mr. Blair was

11:02.800 --> 11:04.360
In my experience,

11:04.360 --> 11:09.160
prime ministers tend to be
either domestic or foreign policy focused.

11:09.160 --> 11:14.320
At this early stage, I'd say Mr. Blair
falls very firmly into the latter camp.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.680
Fiji. Their first since readmission.

Despite all that, it's your interest
in every part of the British Isles

11:51.640 --> 11:54.200

[man speaks indistinctly]

14:17.480 --> 14:20.760
Yeah, yeah. No, I understand.
All right. Okay, bye-bye.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.720
[exhales deeply]

14:24.720 --> 14:27.280
[Blair] And then he said,
"Answer me this, Tony..."

14:27.280 --> 14:29.320
Oh, no, please don't do the accent.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.640
"How many ground troops
are y'all prepared to commit?"

14:33.520 --> 14:37.840
So I say, "Look, Bill, um,
we can talk about numbers all day."

14:37.840 --> 14:41.000
"This is about the bigger picture.
What if Milosevic wins?"

14:41.000 --> 14:42.920
"NATO's credibility is at stake."

14:43.600 --> 14:44.480
To which he said...

14:44.480 --> 14:47.400
"NATO's credibility is
already a busted flush."

14:47.400 --> 14:50.080
- So you're allowed to do the accent.
- I do it better.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.240
He knows the fact
you're coming to him like this

14:53.240 --> 14:55.480
means that NATO's air campaign has failed.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.480
But he still won't do what it takes.
Commit American ground troops.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.760
It's... he's worried about it
looking like another Vietnam

15:02.760 --> 15:05.120
with no political upside
for him domestically.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.640
Well, you're never going to persuade
the White House

15:07.640 --> 15:09.640
by appealing to their interests.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.920
So do what you do best.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.160
Appeal to their consciences.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.520
[Blair] <i>While we meet here
in Chicago this evening,</i>

15:30.480 --> 15:32.760
<i>terrible things are happening in Europe.</i>

15:37.040 --> 15:41.080
<i>No one who has seen what has happened
in Kosovo to those refugees</i>

15:42.040 --> 15:47.960
<i>can be in any doubt
that NATO's military action is justified.</i>

15:51.640 --> 15:55.040
<i>But we must do more
than simply make our case.</i>

15:57.200 --> 15:58.800
<i>We must also succeed.</i>

16:00.080 --> 16:01.080
<i>For that,</i>

16:01.840 --> 16:03.240
<i>we depend on you,</i>

16:04.200 --> 16:05.640
<i>the United States.</i>

16:07.360 --> 16:12.000
<i>You are the most powerful country
in the world,</i>

16:12.880 --> 16:13.880
<i>and the richest.</i>

16:14.680 --> 16:16.440
<i>You are a great nation.</i>

16:19.240 --> 16:20.240
And it must be

16:21.960 --> 16:24.360
difficult, and sometimes irritating,

16:24.360 --> 16:27.320
to find yourself
the recipient of every demand.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.320
To be called upon in every crisis.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.760
To be expected always and everywhere

16:33.760 --> 16:35.760
to do what needs to be done.

16:36.520 --> 16:41.760
The cry, "What's it got to do with us?"
must be heard fairly regularly.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.080
Yet those nations which have the power

16:47.640 --> 16:50.880
have the responsibility to use it wisely.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.840
We need you.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.600
We need America engaged.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.120
And so I say to you,

17:02.640 --> 17:06.600
never fall again
for the doctrine of isolationism,

17:06.600 --> 17:09.760
because the world truly cannot afford it.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.440
Stay, please, a country outward looking.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.560
With the vision and the imagination
which is the very best of your nature.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.920
And realize, too, that in doing so,

17:22.920 --> 17:24.440
you will find in Britain

17:24.960 --> 17:27.320
a friend and an ally

17:28.560 --> 17:30.040
that will stand with you.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.200
Work with you.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.640
Fashion, with you,

17:34.640 --> 17:39.560
the design of a future
built on peace and prosperity for all,

17:40.880 --> 17:46.120
which is the only dream
that makes humanity worth preserving.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.840
Thank you.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.360
[man shouts] Bravo!

17:55.160 --> 17:56.160
[Blair] Thank you.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.840
[indistinct shouts]

18:01.640 --> 18:02.960
[man] What a speech!

18:04.680 --> 18:07.760
[Fellowes] A resounding success
for the prime minister in America.

18:08.960 --> 18:12.480
<i>The New York Times</i> says
the prime minister has a new nickname.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.600
King Tony.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.120
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>
has come out in emphatic support

18:18.120 --> 18:21.000
of his attempts to persuade
a reluctant White House,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.320
but I think the best summary
is from the <i>Chicago Sun Times.</i>

18:24.320 --> 18:28.400
It claims Mr. Blair has beguiled the city
with his charms<i>,</i>

18:28.400 --> 18:33.000
leaving Americans pining
to have him as their president instead.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.080
Goodness.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.320
[Fellowes] I gather President Clinton
is now considering ground war,

18:37.320 --> 18:40.240
which would leave Milosevic
and his Serb forces

18:40.240 --> 18:44.200
with the option to either fight
and face total annihilation

18:45.080 --> 18:46.560
or else withdraw.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.000
And I suspect even they are
sensible enough to choose the latter.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.400
So,

18:52.480 --> 18:54.360
the prime minister pulled it off.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.120
So it seems.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.240
This is an extraordinary political feat.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.280
[exhales deeply]

19:18.000 --> 19:19.720
[bell ringing]

19:22.240 --> 19:25.080
- The prime minister, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.440
[door creaks shut]

19:28.440 --> 19:30.880
I hope you didn't slip on the way here.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.280
[Blair] Ma'am?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.880
It can't be easy
walking on water. [chuckles]

19:35.880 --> 19:37.360
[Blair chuckles] Hmm.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.200
[Elizabeth] Please, do sit down.

19:39.880 --> 19:40.840
So,

19:41.360 --> 19:42.880
you insisted the West

19:43.840 --> 19:47.440
no longer stand by
while genocide and slaughter take place.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.840
And pulled it off
without a single NATO casualty in combat.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.480
Great credit must go to the Americans.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.040
When they signaled
their openness to a ground invasion,

19:57.040 --> 19:59.160
Milosevic realized the game was up.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.280
But Clinton's change of heart
is in great part thanks to you.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.560
It's one thing to have popularity.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.400
It's quite another to have influence.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.440
So I offer you my congratulations.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.160
You are, at this moment, by some margin,

20:15.160 --> 20:17.720
the most celebrated leader
on the world stage,

20:17.720 --> 20:19.720
with remarkable instincts.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.800
And so,

20:23.360 --> 20:24.600
in the light of that...

20:26.920 --> 20:31.400
it's no secret that the Crown has not had
the best time of it in recent years.

20:31.960 --> 20:36.120
Often, our values and those of the country
have not been perfectly aligned.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.040
You, on the other hand,

20:38.960 --> 20:42.000
since you entered Number 10,
you've shown an uncanny ability

20:42.000 --> 20:44.760
to read the mood of the country
better than anyone.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.880
And so I can't help but ask...

20:55.000 --> 20:56.080
what would you do

20:57.800 --> 20:59.600
to turn things around for us?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.200
If you were in charge.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.520
If I were in charge of the monarchy?

21:08.320 --> 21:10.080
If you were in my shoes.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.520
If I were king?

21:15.880 --> 21:16.760
Yes.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.160
Goodness.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.480
For someone who so rarely
puts a foot wrong,

21:25.480 --> 21:28.200
this seems to be
a dangerous loss of judgment.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.800
She's asking for advice.
She doesn't need to take it.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.040
But who is she asking?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.920
- The prime minister.
- An avowed reformer and modernizer.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.320
Her chief advisor.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.640
I'm her chief advisor.

21:39.760 --> 21:44.360
Actually... constitutionally, Robert,
I think you'll find he is.

21:47.920 --> 21:51.720
Can we walk through the five big changes
that we wanna make?

21:51.720 --> 21:52.800
[man] Modernization.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.400
We reduce expenditure.
Everyone's doing it.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.120
It's only fair that the Queen
is doing it as well. Right?

21:58.120 --> 21:59.760
- Some examples.
- Listen to this.

21:59.760 --> 22:03.720
Royal train, fifteen hundred pounds
for catering per journey.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.920
[woman] Time to get them
in line with New Labour.

22:05.920 --> 22:10.440
Honestly, it's an anachronistic,
unrepresentative feudal system

22:10.440 --> 22:13.160
based on a thousand years
of hereditary privilege.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.200
You'd be better off
trying to modernize Stonehenge.

22:16.200 --> 22:20.280
Let's do the monarchy first, and then
we can get round to prehistoric monuments.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.280
Aren't those two things the same?

22:22.280 --> 22:23.480
[Blair chuckles softly]

22:23.480 --> 22:26.560
Okay, I know it's unexciting,
but administrative reform.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.800
We run the royals
like we run the civil service.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.400
- [woman 2] Yes!
- [man] Accountability.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.280
There's nothing else that matters.
It's just that.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.920
[Cherie Blair] I mean, not being allowed
to marry a Catholic.

22:36.920 --> 22:41.240
The Human Rights Act states people have
the right to marry whoever they want.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.600
Says the Queen's counsel.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.360
Well, that's wrong too.
I should be called senior counsel.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.160
[man] <i>I think we can spin it like this.</i>

22:47.160 --> 22:49.000
It would look really good

22:49.000 --> 22:52.480
if it came from the Palace that they're
prepared to tighten the purses.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.680
She knows that there has to be a change.

22:54.680 --> 22:57.760
Yes, yes! The voters
don't wanna take down the monarchy.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.160
Can you put a version of that
in the dossier?

23:01.520 --> 23:03.320
[Cherie Blair] <i>It's all wrong, Tony.</i>

23:04.600 --> 23:06.080
Seriously. Wrong.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.000
Needs changing.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.760
[Blair] I'd like to start by thanking you
for giving me the opportunity to do this.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.880
Most of the time, we don't think seriously
about the monarchy in this country.

23:27.880 --> 23:32.200
We just subject you all
to a lot of hurtful and frivolous gossip.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.040
Really? I hadn't noticed.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.120
[chuckles softly]

23:36.640 --> 23:40.520
But, uh, having consulted with
my closest advisors,

23:40.520 --> 23:41.440
uh,

23:42.080 --> 23:46.120
we do all agree that the institution
is in need of some reform.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.400
That much was clear after the death
of Diana, Princess of Wales

23:50.400 --> 23:52.960
when we saw an outpouring of grief

23:52.960 --> 23:55.360
turn into a mass movement for change.

23:56.760 --> 24:02.160
So I thought we might start with something
I know you're already considering.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.440
Primogeniture.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.360
Yes.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.800
Demoting eldest daughters
in the line of succession,

24:08.800 --> 24:12.600
I think we can all agree,
makes little sense in a modern society.

24:12.600 --> 24:16.200
As an eldest daughter myself,
I don't object to that in principle.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.960
But to turn over centuries
of royal legislation is no small task.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.080
You'd have to consult with
the 15 other countries

24:24.080 --> 24:25.280
where I'm head of state.

24:27.160 --> 24:31.000
Where the will is there, these things
can usually change quickly. Um...

24:31.600 --> 24:33.560
Another area is transparency.

24:34.160 --> 24:37.280
My government will soon be introducing
a Freedom of Information Act.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.160
I believe the monarchy
might benefit from something similar.

24:40.160 --> 24:45.120
An annual report setting out performance,
assets, salaries. Total accountability.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.680
Think of the Crown
as a public limited company

24:48.680 --> 24:51.920
and the people of Britain
as shareholders, not subjects.

24:53.000 --> 24:53.880
I see.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.360
[Blair] The, um...

24:56.440 --> 25:00.120
It's now nearly 300 years since
William III signed the Act of Settlement

25:00.120 --> 25:02.120
to a secure a Protestant monarchy, and

25:03.400 --> 25:06.680
there have been growing calls
for a... a review

25:06.680 --> 25:09.720
of some of
the more anti-Catholic provisions,

25:09.720 --> 25:13.320
which surely have no place
in a plural society like ours.

25:15.120 --> 25:20.440
I can understand permitting members
of the royal family to marry Catholics,

25:20.960 --> 25:23.560
but for Catholics to be
in the direct line of succession

25:23.560 --> 25:25.600
would open the way to a Catholic monarch.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.360
Well, of course
there'll be technical issues.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.840
Slightly more than technical issues.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.680
It would be the disestablishment
of the Church of England.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.720
We have to be willing
to look at the big questions.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.920
It's no use nibbling around the periphery.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.000
Should it be the monarch's role
to appoint the prime minister?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.760
Of course. It's a government
in the sovereign's name.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.920
But to be able to dissolve Parliament,
to give laws royal assent...

25:50.920 --> 25:52.320
They don't in Sweden.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.840
These functions can be carried out
by the speaker of the House of Commons.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.720
Should the monarch be
commander-in-chief of the armed forces?

25:58.720 --> 26:01.000
They aren't in Sweden, in the Netherlands,

26:01.000 --> 26:04.200
which brings me to the...
to the matter of pomp and splendor.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.640
I've been looking at
some of the ceremonial offices

26:08.640 --> 26:11.080
in the royal household, and they include

26:12.280 --> 26:14.280
a hereditary Grand Falconer.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.880
Dear Murray. What about him?

26:17.760 --> 26:21.160
Does the job
really need to depend on birth, not merit?

26:23.920 --> 26:28.360
Um, the Queen's Herb Strewer
and the Washer of the Sovereign's Hands.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.720
That is only once per reign,

26:30.720 --> 26:32.960
and only when I'm in residence
at Holyroodhouse.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.360
Still, a Royal Bargemaster
and 24 watermen,

26:37.360 --> 26:40.760
even though there hasn't been
a royal barge since 1849.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.640
A Warden of the Swans?

26:42.640 --> 26:46.760
Someone has to oversee the swans
in England's inland waterways,

26:46.760 --> 26:49.680
over which the Crown has
an ancient prerogative right.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.560
But is that prerogative right?

26:53.040 --> 26:55.440
I understand that the role
dates from the 12th century

26:55.440 --> 26:58.440
as a way to claim swans
as delicacies for royal banquets.

26:58.440 --> 27:02.040
Now that the swan has, one imagines,
fallen out of the culinary repertoire,

27:02.040 --> 27:04.360
how does one justify the role today?

27:04.360 --> 27:06.960
Kings and queens
might not be eating them anymore.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.840
Someone has to care for them.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.880
We check them for injuries.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.120
Maintain their habitat.

27:14.880 --> 27:18.240
Ring them with tags
from the British Trust for Ornithology.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.320
Conservation.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.360
And that's before
we get to the most anachronistic of all.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.480
Ceremonies.
The State Opening of Parliament.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.000
Do we really need ten heralds?

27:27.000 --> 27:32.720
Including the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant
and the Maltravers Herald Extraordinary?

27:33.360 --> 27:36.560
The Gold Stick in Waiting.
The Silver Stick in Waiting.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.120
The Gentleman Usher of the Sword of State?

27:41.200 --> 27:42.880
I think what we're suggesting is

27:44.360 --> 27:46.000
a purge of honorifics,

27:46.000 --> 27:50.440
a... a bonfire of sinecures
might be a useful concession...

27:52.600 --> 27:53.880
and PR victory.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.600
[bell rings]

28:00.600 --> 28:01.680
[door opens]

28:01.680 --> 28:04.320
I obviously need to give
all this careful thought.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.000
Your Majesty.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.800
[door creaks shut]

28:14.040 --> 28:16.400
[Cherie Blair] So, how was it?

28:16.400 --> 28:18.480
[indistinct news report on TV]

28:19.000 --> 28:21.200
- A little frosty.
- [Cherie Blair] I'll bet.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.200
But she promised to give our proposals
some further thought.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.880
Oh... Well, If she doesn't,
and the people get fed up with them,

28:28.880 --> 28:30.720
she'll only have herself to blame.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.000
Britain is mature enough
as a country and a democracy

28:35.000 --> 28:36.880
to live without this nonsense.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.120
The preservation of the monarchy's
her life's work.

28:42.920 --> 28:47.000
She must know that they have to change
in order to survive.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.520
No, they don't want to change, Tony.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.400
I mean, she probably thinks
the only way to survive

28:54.400 --> 28:57.120
is to double down on the madness.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.800
Like the Catholic Church.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.680
- Let's not bring the church into this.
- Well, they modernized.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.600
And the old guard
has never forgiven them for it.

29:07.280 --> 29:11.680
Why? Because they got rid of the Latin
and the incense and the miracles

29:11.680 --> 29:14.360
and the mystery,
and people stopped coming.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.280
This is different.

29:19.000 --> 29:19.840
Is it?

29:24.520 --> 29:26.680
- [bells tolling in distance]
- [man huffing]

29:28.160 --> 29:30.160
[panting]

29:34.200 --> 29:35.800
Mr. Hawkins next, please.

29:35.800 --> 29:36.840
Yes.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.600
[Hawkins clears throat]

29:40.680 --> 29:42.760
[Elizabeth] <i>Please,
make yourself comfortable.</i>

29:44.960 --> 29:45.800
Swans?

29:45.800 --> 29:48.160
That's it. I'm the Warden of the Swans.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.800
It says here your role is
one of the oldest in the household.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.120
That's right, sir.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.880
We've gone through several incarnations
over the years.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.080
The Keeper of the King's Swans,

29:59.080 --> 30:02.480
the King's Swan Master,
and now the Warden of the Swans.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.920
[somber music playing]

30:07.880 --> 30:10.160
[Fellowes] And what is your precise title?

30:10.160 --> 30:12.520
I am the Queen's Herb Strewer.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.760
The Queen's Guide to the Sands.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.200
Yeoman of the Glass and China Pantry.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.760
Could you tell us what your role involves
day by day?

30:22.400 --> 30:26.960
[yeoman] It's my job to supervise
the glassware and earthenware

30:26.960 --> 30:29.280
across all the royal palaces.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.480
I oversee stocks.

30:31.480 --> 30:35.360
I guard against any damage and breakages.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.160
[Elizabeth] What have you got there?

30:37.840 --> 30:40.640
<i>Lawes, Orders and Customs for Swans.</i>

30:41.640 --> 30:45.320
The authoritative text
for the Keeper of the King's Swans.

30:46.480 --> 30:50.320
<i>It's been guiding us for centuries.
Since 1482, by my reckoning,</i>

30:50.320 --> 30:51.840
<i>and the reign of Edward IV.</i>

30:51.840 --> 30:54.440
[guide] Seen the bay change
in all manner of ways.

30:54.440 --> 30:59.080
Years of high tides and heavy rainfall
will change sands beyond recognition.

30:59.600 --> 31:03.480
Believe me, I've seen shallow gullies
turn into deep ravines.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.720
[Elizabeth] <i>What is your official title?</i>

31:05.720 --> 31:06.920
Astronomer Royal.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.400
Piper to the Sovereign.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.320
Lord High Admiral of the Wash, ma'am.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.400
[yeoman] And my responsibilities
also include

31:13.400 --> 31:19.480
folding all 170
of the embroidered white linen napkins.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.120
<i>- </i> [Elizabeth] <i>Oh, that's you!
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

31:21.120 --> 31:24.200
[Elizabeth] You are clever.
How on earth do you do that?

31:24.200 --> 31:28.640
Few have truly mastered
the Dutch bonnet napkin fold.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.040
[Elizabeth] "<i>The swan</i>

31:31.720 --> 31:35.840
is a pure and graceful beast."

31:37.280 --> 31:39.960
How is your 15th century calligraphy,
Robert?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.440
A little rusty. Let's see...

31:45.760 --> 31:48.600
"Her feathers are white as snow

31:49.800 --> 31:51.880
and as brief in duration."

31:53.720 --> 31:59.240
"For she signifieth
the passing nature of fair things."

32:00.800 --> 32:05.320
"For though we wish our splendor
to be everlasting,

32:06.120 --> 32:10.920
no thing must remain of what is passed."

32:15.520 --> 32:17.320
[somber music fades out]

32:17.320 --> 32:20.320
The longer it went on,
the heavier my heart became.

32:20.840 --> 32:21.840
I agree.

32:22.760 --> 32:25.320
A sense of pride in the tradition.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.600
I think my favorite

32:31.000 --> 32:32.760
was the Yeoman Bed Hanger.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.040
[Fellowes chuckles] Yes.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.800
Or the Lord High Admiral of the Wash.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.360
[Queen Mother] So they don't want
Black Rod knocking on the door

32:48.360 --> 32:51.200
or the Lord Great Chamberlain
walking backwards?

32:51.200 --> 32:55.080
They've also suggested
getting rid of the cap of maintenance,

32:55.080 --> 32:58.840
presumably on the grounds that it can
only be worn by a peer of the realm.

32:58.840 --> 33:02.000
[Queen Mother] But it's so full
of color and character

33:02.000 --> 33:05.240
and a glorious sea of vermilion.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.800
[Charles] Well, I think,
from a PR standpoint,

33:07.800 --> 33:10.280
it might be sensible
to make one or two concessions.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.200
Really?

33:11.200 --> 33:14.480
Leave us less open
to charges of elitism and grandiosity.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.200
But that's missing the point.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.800
The whole purpose of the State Opening
is to humble the monarch.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.280
The Crown's representative, Black Rod,

33:24.280 --> 33:28.440
knocks on the door of the House of Commons
and is rebuffed three times.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.520
Why?

33:30.400 --> 33:32.440
Because the last time a king

33:33.520 --> 33:36.280
overstepped the mark
and entered the Commons,

33:36.840 --> 33:37.800
Charles I,

33:38.440 --> 33:41.400
it led to civil war and his execution.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.440
Parliament is warning the monarch.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.360
"Never forget,

33:48.360 --> 33:49.520
we are in charge."

33:50.080 --> 33:54.000
She still arrives in the Irish state coach
with an escort of household cavalry

33:54.000 --> 33:56.720
and hundreds of guardsmen
lining the route.

33:56.720 --> 34:00.080
It doesn't immediately feel like
a lesson in humility.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.320
Are we really being lectured on humility
by the Prince of Wales?

34:03.320 --> 34:04.240
[Anne] We are.

34:04.240 --> 34:08.160
I just don't feel there's anything wrong
with running the monarchy on more

34:08.160 --> 34:10.440
rational and democratic lines.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.920
But monarchy isn't rational.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.720
Or democratic or logical or fair.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.360
Haven't we all learned that by now?

34:22.560 --> 34:26.280
People don't want to come to a palace
and get what they could have at home.

34:27.600 --> 34:31.320
When they come for an investiture
or a state visit,

34:31.320 --> 34:35.040
when they brush up against us,
they want the magic and the mystery.

34:35.560 --> 34:38.320
And the arcane and the eccentric
and the symbolic.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.360
And

34:40.560 --> 34:41.840
the transcendent.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.440
They want to feel like
they've entered another world.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.080
That is our duty.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.560
To lift people up
and transport them into another realm,

34:52.560 --> 34:56.240
not bring them down to earth
and remind them of what they already have.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.440
Hear, hear.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.680
[newswoman] <i>The world has been gripped
as the race for the White House</i>

35:02.680 --> 35:07.080
<i>has boiled down to a recount
in the battleground state of Florida.</i>

35:07.080 --> 35:09.520
<i>Many in the Labour Party
had hoped for a victory</i>

35:09.520 --> 35:11.840
<i>for Vice President Al Gore.</i>

35:11.840 --> 35:15.280
<i>But, in a dramatic late-night ruling,</i>

35:15.280 --> 35:19.320
<i>the US Supreme Court voted 5-4
to stop the recount,</i>

35:19.320 --> 35:24.240
<i>effectively handing the presidency
to Texas governor George W. Bush.</i>

35:24.240 --> 35:28.680
<i>Blair's closest international ally will be
a man he has never spoken to or met.</i>

35:28.680 --> 35:30.800
[Blair] It couldn't have been
more awkward.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.480
The Clintons were making
their farewell visit to the UK

35:33.480 --> 35:37.400
and staying with us at Chequers
while the... the ruling was being made.

35:37.400 --> 35:42.000
So... there we all were,
watching CNN in the middle of the night

35:42.000 --> 35:43.840
as the election is being decided...

35:43.840 --> 35:44.880
Oh dear.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.320
The following day,
President Clinton had to deliver a speech

35:47.320 --> 35:50.480
at the University of Warwick
with me giving the opening remarks.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.120
Well, I had no choice

35:52.120 --> 35:55.440
but to offer warm congratulations
to President-Elect Bush

35:55.440 --> 35:57.560
in front of my good friend.

35:58.640 --> 36:02.520
Will it be challenging for you?
To have a Republican White House?

36:03.240 --> 36:05.440
I see no reason not to be optimistic.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.960
Let's not forget,
I'll be the senior partner now,

36:09.960 --> 36:12.920
so I hope to be able
to influence President Bush.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.120
[Elizabeth] Mm.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.760
Your Majesty.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.840
Prime Minister.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.080
[Blair clicks tongue] Uh...

36:30.040 --> 36:33.000
My office sent suggestions
ahead of the State Opening of Parliament.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.960
I wondered if you had a chance
to look at them?

36:35.720 --> 36:39.000
Rather more than that.
I discussed them with my family.

36:40.440 --> 36:43.040
Believe it or not, for my first child,

36:43.040 --> 36:45.640
it was still custom
to summon the home secretary

36:45.640 --> 36:47.640
to witness a royal birth.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.920
My father put a stop to it,
with my consent,

36:52.920 --> 36:55.040
so I'm not against reform.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.280
The question is, what is worth preserving
and where to draw the line.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.480
Thank you.

36:59.480 --> 37:03.280
We have now conducted a thorough review
of all the offices in my household,

37:03.280 --> 37:06.600
and what we discovered
was not indefensible extravagance

37:06.600 --> 37:10.600
or luxury or a collection
of empty Ruritanian titles,

37:10.600 --> 37:14.360
but an extraordinary array
of precious expertise,

37:14.360 --> 37:17.640
skills that had been passed down
for generations,

37:17.640 --> 37:19.680
all from within the same families.

37:19.680 --> 37:23.600
And the vehicle for that continuity
is the Crown.

37:24.680 --> 37:26.240
The spell that we cast,

37:26.240 --> 37:29.360
and have cast for centuries,
is our immutability.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.480
Tradition is our strength.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.280
Respect for our forebears

37:35.920 --> 37:40.840
and the preservation of generations
of their wisdom and learned experience.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.920
Modernity is not always the answer.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.360
Sometimes antiquity is too.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.640
Very good. Very good.
Are you ready? Are you ready?

37:57.640 --> 37:59.480
- [toy squeaking]
- All right, there.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.080
- [knock at door]
- [door opens]

38:02.760 --> 38:03.920
Am I disturbing, ma'am?

38:03.920 --> 38:06.880
Oh, Robert. No, not at all.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.080
I just wanted to express my relief, ma'am.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.160
That I came to my senses?

38:15.000 --> 38:18.560
For a moment, we risked compromising
the very things that make us distinctive.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.120
Please.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.920
Which leads me to think...

38:28.640 --> 38:31.760
that it might be best
if I personally were to move on.

38:32.920 --> 38:33.920
Robert.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.360
It's true, ma'am.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.840
At crucial moments, the Palace
has failed to read the public mood.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.200
And much of the blame rests with me.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.600
- Surely not.
- It's a question of temperament.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.600
Knowing when to be flexible.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.800
My problem is, I'm an old stick.
I'd rather not change anything at all.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.680
I tend to see things as binary.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.080
Either you keep things as they are

39:00.160 --> 39:02.320
or it's closing time
in the gardens of the West.

39:03.840 --> 39:08.120
But you can make alterations
without tearing down the building.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.760
My deputy, Robin Janvrin,
is far better placed to do that.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.760
He's much more attuned.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.360
And deserving of a step up.

39:17.360 --> 39:20.280
Of course Robin will make
an excellent private secretary,

39:20.280 --> 39:22.000
but he's still a young man.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.800
Is there nothing I can do
to persuade you to stay?

39:27.280 --> 39:29.440
Sometimes it's helpful to offer a scalp.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.800
This way... everyone benefits.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.720
The public gets sent a signal.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.360
You get better advice
than I could ever possibly give.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.160
I get to play more cricket. [exhales]

39:44.160 --> 39:46.560
[somber music playing]

39:46.560 --> 39:49.120
I don't know how I'll manage.
I shall be utterly lost.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.120
No, ma'am, you won't. You'll be just fine.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.960
You've navigated this latest matter
perfectly without my help.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.320
Every minute has been an honor, ma'am.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
[door shuts]

40:30.200 --> 40:32.600
And finally, ma'am,
your visit to Brighton and Hove

40:32.600 --> 40:35.360
as one of the government's
designated Millennium Cities.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.320
Yes.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.720
I have drafted a program of engagements

40:38.720 --> 40:43.760
that I hope preserves the traditional
but adds a somewhat modern sensibility.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.760
On the one hand, lunch at the Pavilion,

40:47.760 --> 40:51.400
in tribute to your
great-great-great-great uncle George IV.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.680
On the other,
a visit to the Sussex Innovation Center

40:54.680 --> 40:58.920
to see a demonstration
of an insectoid robot called Maggie.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.000
Right.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.720
One last thing
you might be interested to know.

41:08.720 --> 41:09.840
The prime minister...

41:10.920 --> 41:11.760
Yes?

41:12.280 --> 41:15.680
...uh, has chosen to address
the Women's Institute,

41:17.280 --> 41:21.560
as part of his mission
to consolidate support in Middle England.

41:21.560 --> 41:22.640
Really?

41:23.320 --> 41:25.640
I wouldn't have said
they were his sort of crowd.

41:26.520 --> 41:30.760
But his unerring judgment is what one
has always had to admire him for.

41:31.720 --> 41:35.400
And his ability
to win over seemingly... anyone.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.160
I'm sure this will be no exception.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.800
[gentle piano tune playing]

41:43.160 --> 41:44.400
[exhales slowly]

41:45.480 --> 41:48.680
[women singing] <i>♪ And did those feet ♪</i>

41:48.680 --> 41:51.880

41:52.720 --> 41:58.040

41:58.040 --> 42:03.640

42:04.200 --> 42:09.640

42:10.160 --> 42:13.440
<i>-♪ And did the countenance... ♪</i>
- [Blair] <i>A modern voice for women.</i>

42:13.440 --> 42:16.360
It is a clear and admirable
statement of ideals.

42:17.880 --> 42:22.360
But what does it mean
to be modern in a new Britain,

42:22.960 --> 42:25.440
driven by change and innovation?

42:26.200 --> 42:29.080
Make no mistake, there are
many traditions we can be proud of,

42:29.080 --> 42:32.840
but we must never cling to tradition
for its own sake.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.040
In the 21st century,

42:36.040 --> 42:38.280
we must ask ourselves

42:38.280 --> 42:40.800
what kind of values we want to promote.

42:41.920 --> 42:46.120
We must take what's best from the past
but never be in thrall to it.

42:47.040 --> 42:52.080
Old-fashioned practices
can sometimes hold progress back.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.320
I believe, and the Labour Party believes,

42:55.840 --> 43:00.640
that a new, updated concept
of community is needed

43:01.160 --> 43:04.680
to keep up with the fast pace of change
in the modern world.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.560
I was elected leader of the Labour Party

43:07.560 --> 43:10.720
because I understood
that we had a radical mission

43:10.720 --> 43:13.760
to change not just
the politics of this country

43:14.280 --> 43:16.480
but the constitution of this country.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.640
The soul of this country.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.760
[light murmuring]

43:19.760 --> 43:23.080
"Radical" is not a word
to be frightened of.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.560
It is a word to embrace.

43:25.560 --> 43:26.600
[light murmuring]

43:26.600 --> 43:31.920
Because I fear that if we are not radical,
we will not succeed in our mission.

43:32.840 --> 43:35.360
Look at what we've done
in the House of Lords, taking...

43:35.360 --> 43:36.360
[loud clap]

43:37.680 --> 43:40.760
...taking drastic action
against hereditary privilege.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.440
- Thank you very much.
- [clapping in unison]

43:45.360 --> 43:47.360
Look, the world is changing fast.

43:47.360 --> 43:50.760
- [clapping in unison]
- Oh, okay, right. [chuckles softly]

43:51.480 --> 43:53.240
And change is tough. We know that.

43:53.240 --> 43:55.320
[clapping continues]

43:58.240 --> 44:02.560
It's no wonder people feel worried
and wish to hold tight to the old ways,

44:02.560 --> 44:04.400
[newsman] <i>A run-in
with the Women's Institute</i>

44:04.400 --> 44:06.600
<i>was surely not what
the prime minister had in mind</i>

44:06.600 --> 44:08.800
<i>as he made his return
to the political fray.</i>

44:08.800 --> 44:12.360
<i>The chairwoman of the WI says
that she had urged Mr. Blair</i>

44:12.360 --> 44:14.240
<i>not to make his speech party political.</i>

44:14.240 --> 44:18.320
<i>...take on the forces

44:18.320 --> 44:21.040
[woman] <i>Let the prime minister speak!</i>

44:21.040 --> 44:22.200
[women] No!

44:22.200 --> 44:25.480
- [clapping intensifies]
- I'm glad we're having a good debate.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.240
[scattered jeering]

44:35.080 --> 44:38.000
[Elizabeth] <i>He can charm America,
indeed, the whole world,</i>

44:38.600 --> 44:40.880
but comes up short
with the Women's Institute.

44:41.400 --> 44:44.960
I'm getting stick for it from my aides,
who all advised against doing it.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.800
You were political with the WI,

44:47.800 --> 44:50.040
the one thing
we pride ourselves on never being.

44:50.040 --> 44:52.200
Well, as far as criticisms go,

44:52.200 --> 44:55.080
being too political is
one I think I can live with.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.800
It would be like someone
describing you as being too royal.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.600
I think I've come to realize
there's no such thing as too royal.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.640
If you're doing it, do it properly.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.440
And unapologetically.

45:13.520 --> 45:14.520
I understand.

45:17.680 --> 45:18.520
So...

45:20.320 --> 45:21.160
So...

45:21.160 --> 45:23.480
[somber music rises slowly]

45:23.480 --> 45:24.800
I'm sure you're aware,

45:24.800 --> 45:30.480
the EU has just published a draft
of its new Charter for Fundamental Rights

45:30.480 --> 45:33.120
ahead of the forthcoming summit
in Portugal.

45:33.760 --> 45:37.760
[voice fading] Our hope is that it will
reflect the original remit of the EU,

45:37.760 --> 45:41.760
merely to summarize existing rights.
However, if it...

45:41.760 --> 45:43.840
[somber music fades]

45:45.480 --> 45:48.480
[choral version
of "Things Can Only Get Better" playing]

46:51.200 --> 46:53.000
[music fades out]
