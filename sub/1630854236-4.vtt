Okay, Cap, judging

08:59.507 --> 09:01.889
by what you're saying, we don't
have probable cause yet.

09:01.989 --> 09:03.930

-Guess that means

09:04.030 --> 09:05.492
we just got
to catch 'em in the act.

09:05.592 --> 09:07.653

but here's the thing.

09:07.753 --> 09:09.615

on federal land,

09:09.715 --> 09:13.658
so we're gonna be sharing
jurisdiction with FBI, ATF, DHS.

10:37.824 --> 10:40.286
the FBI was first
to arrive on the scene,

10:40.386 --> 10:42.208
so, stands to reason
that they would

10:42.308 --> 10:44.530
have the most relevant info.

10:44.630 --> 10:46.631
-Huh.
-Huh.

-FBI was the right call.
-Yeah.

11:00.842 --> 11:02.584
-He's batting 1.000 so far.
-Mm-hmm.

11:02.684 --> 11:05.746
Yeah, but I got a feeling
he's about to strike out.

11:05.846 --> 11:07.508
What? Are you kidding?

11:07.608 --> 11:10.510

11:13.773 --> 11:16.715
Uh, that FBI agent is gonna
give him a run for his money.

11:16.815 --> 11:18.156
Right, Cap?

11:18.256 --> 11:20.838
-What do you mean?
-Oh, come on.

11:20.938 --> 11:22.840
Tell me you don't remember him.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.441
JAMES:
His face isn't ringing
any bells, no.

11:24.541 --> 11:26.643
Killjoy.
FBI Special Agent Kilbourne

11:26.743 --> 11:29.005
from that Galveston thing.
Picture him with facial hair.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.686
-He had one
of those silly, little...
-Oh, my God.

11:30.786 --> 11:32.527
-Yes. Yes.
-That's him.

11:32.627 --> 11:34.769
-(Walker laughs)
-Who?
-Kilbourne ran point

11:34.869 --> 11:37.331
on this bank robber case
we worked, like, 100 years ago.

11:37.431 --> 11:39.053
We had another nickname for him.

11:39.153 --> 11:41.294
-Killjoy, the Hairy Brick Wall.
-The hair... (laughs)

11:41.394 --> 11:44.617
Yeah, yeah. Get it. Ooh. Ah.

11:44.717 --> 11:46.258
-Poor Trey.
-WALKER: Yeah.
-JAMES: Looks like

11:46.358 --> 11:48.140
hell week might be a little
more fun than I thought.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.482
(Cassie chuckles)

11:55.646 --> 11:56.546
(engine stops)

11:56.646 --> 11:58.868
Congrats.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.530
You haven't uttered a single
word this entire car ride.

12:02.891 --> 12:04.593
Okay. What do you want me
to say?

12:04.693 --> 12:08.596
You know, you've single-handedly
ruined my entire junior year.

12:08.696 --> 12:10.677
I-I just... I-I thought that
whenever you went to college,

12:10.778 --> 12:12.759
it'd finally be my year.

12:12.859 --> 12:16.062
But you stayed home
and I get nothing, as usual.

12:17.063 --> 12:21.226
Okay, wow,
that was... kind of harsh.

12:23.988 --> 12:25.990
But you do make a point.

12:27.871 --> 12:30.133
What is this, some kind
of, like, Jedi mind trick,

12:30.233 --> 12:32.174
-reverse psychology thingie?
What are you...
-No.

12:32.274 --> 12:34.136
It's the truth.

12:34.236 --> 12:36.818
I didn't really consider how
any of this would affect you.

12:36.918 --> 12:39.140
Or me, for that matter.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.662
I made this crazy,

12:41.762 --> 12:43.864
last-minute decision
to ditch college,

12:43.964 --> 12:47.346
and I have no idea what I want
to do with the rest of my life,

12:47.446 --> 12:49.528
and that is pretty terrifying.

12:50.529 --> 12:53.511
So, maybe you could try

12:53.611 --> 12:55.513
just cutting me a little slack

12:55.613 --> 12:57.034
while I figure things out.

12:57.134 --> 12:59.196
-(school bell ringing)
-Whatever.

12:59.296 --> 13:01.337
I'm late for homeroom.

13:04.060 --> 13:06.622
(car door closes)

13:12.306 --> 13:13.767
So, how much experience

13:13.867 --> 13:16.689
do you have
working with horses, Liam?

13:16.790 --> 13:19.852
-Well, um, I grew up
on the ranch next door.
-Mm-hmm.

13:19.952 --> 13:23.055
My daddy had us riding
pretty much since we could walk.

13:23.155 --> 13:26.417
When you say "us,"
you mean you and your brother,

13:26.517 --> 13:29.620
Cordell? That's the one
you were held captive with?

13:29.720 --> 13:32.162
Yeah.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.784
What we do here

13:34.884 --> 13:37.586
is called EAP.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.548
That's equine assisted
psychotherapy.

13:40.648 --> 13:43.951
See, Liam,
horses have a way of...

13:44.051 --> 13:46.993
putting people at ease

13:47.093 --> 13:49.195
and helping 'em open up.

13:49.295 --> 13:53.158
There's something mystical
about a horse.

13:53.258 --> 13:55.640
(laughs)
Now,

13:55.740 --> 13:57.842
this here's Ol' Kenny.

13:57.942 --> 14:01.125
Now, before you come over
and introduce yourself,

14:01.225 --> 14:03.406
I want you to take a couple

14:03.506 --> 14:06.369
of deep, cleansing breaths,

14:06.469 --> 14:09.171
try to clear out
all that negative energy.

14:09.271 --> 14:11.573
(chuckles softly)
Okay. I'm fine, Chelsea.

14:11.673 --> 14:14.015
-I've actually been around
horses my whole life.
-Okay.

14:14.115 --> 14:15.176
Come.

14:15.276 --> 14:17.057
-(neighing)
-Wh-Whoa, whoa!

14:17.157 --> 14:20.540
-Whoa, baby. Hey. Hey, now.
That's okay.
-(chuffing)

14:20.640 --> 14:23.942
-What'd I do?
-A horse can sense
a person's energy.

14:24.043 --> 14:25.624
And yours is just...

14:25.724 --> 14:28.686
(clicks tongue)
just "meh," right?

14:29.887 --> 14:31.829
What do you say?

14:31.929 --> 14:34.090
You want to try this again?

14:42.897 --> 14:44.799
(Trey sighs)

14:44.899 --> 14:46.600
Wow, that FBI agent--

14:46.700 --> 14:49.162
I swear, talking
to that man is like...

14:49.262 --> 14:51.084
-Talking to a brick wall?
-Yeah.

14:51.184 --> 14:53.566
Wh... You know the guy?

14:53.666 --> 14:55.367
Yeah.
(clears throat)

14:55.467 --> 14:57.209
(laughs)

14:57.309 --> 14:59.330
I see what this is.
Y'all set me up.

14:59.430 --> 15:01.572
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
-Sw-Swear. No.

15:01.672 --> 15:03.093
We had no idea he was gonna
be here. Just dumb luck.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.855
Dumb, bad luck.

15:04.955 --> 15:06.576
But if charisma
is your superpower,

15:06.676 --> 15:08.498
-then that man
is your kryptonite.
-(laughter)

15:08.598 --> 15:10.899
I don't know why y'all
find this so damn funny.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.621
-I got nothing.
-JAMES: That's not true.

15:12.721 --> 15:14.022
You learned
a valuable lesson.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.503
Feds don't always
play by the rules.

15:15.603 --> 15:17.985
A Ranger has
to learn how to adapt.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.227
-You know? Pivot.
-Yeah.

15:20.327 --> 15:22.489
All right, what's the next move,
Trainee Barnett?

15:24.891 --> 15:28.834
The plan is to catch
these people in the act, right?

15:28.934 --> 15:31.276
I've reviewed all the files,

15:31.376 --> 15:34.478
and there are four federal
corrals within a 50-mile radius

15:34.578 --> 15:36.560
of Austin that
they haven't hit yet.

15:36.660 --> 15:37.921
If I could convince the Feds

15:38.021 --> 15:40.683
to play nice
and pool our resources,

15:40.783 --> 15:43.065
we'd have enough agents
to stake out each one.

15:45.387 --> 15:47.809
I mean, who knows.
Maybe we get lucky, right?

15:47.909 --> 15:52.212
All right, Barnett.
Stakeout it is.

15:52.312 --> 15:55.174
Uh, snacks are on me, but
you're buying the energy drinks.

15:55.274 --> 15:57.276
I got you.

16:06.844 --> 16:08.845
(Cassie sighs)

16:15.931 --> 16:18.993
You realise we could
all be home right now

16:19.093 --> 16:21.635
instead of chasing
a bunch of criminals who--

16:21.735 --> 16:23.517
I mean, let's face it--
didn't actually

16:23.617 --> 16:25.558
do anything all that criminal.

16:25.658 --> 16:27.640
Last time I checked,
destruction of federal property

16:27.740 --> 16:29.722
was still fairly criminal.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.804
Okay, sure, but,

16:32.904 --> 16:35.366
I mean, they were freeing
a bunch of mustangs

16:35.466 --> 16:37.688
who otherwise would have
gone to slaughter.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.129
I mean, is that so terrible?

16:39.229 --> 16:40.570
Look, these people know the law.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.211
They're intentionally
breaking it.

16:42.312 --> 16:43.352
They could have gone through
legitimate channels.

16:43.432 --> 16:44.333
They didn't.

16:44.433 --> 16:46.435
♪ ♪

16:47.636 --> 16:50.938
Well, sometimes...

16:51.038 --> 16:53.140
people ignore
legitimate channels

16:53.240 --> 16:54.901
when conditions
on the ground suggest

16:55.002 --> 16:57.143
a different approach
might be needed.

16:57.243 --> 16:59.885
Wait.
Are you agreeing with me?

17:01.367 --> 17:04.789
I...

17:04.889 --> 17:06.471
I don't know.
I-I think I'm just...

17:06.571 --> 17:08.472
Uh, it was just...
Overtired.

17:08.572 --> 17:11.154
-(laughs, clears throat,
sniffles)
-(phone chimes)

17:11.254 --> 17:14.697
Oh, look. It's my new BFF,
Agent Kilbourne.

17:15.698 --> 17:18.480
No activity at any
of the other corrals, either.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.442
-(sighs)
-I'm sorry, Cap.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.004
All right, it's nearly sunup.

17:23.104 --> 17:25.405
-My butt hurts.
-Ugh. Yeah.

17:25.506 --> 17:26.927
Let's pull up stakes
and head home.

17:27.027 --> 17:28.648
WALKER:
Yeah, let's head home.

17:28.748 --> 17:32.011
Uh, but that means,
uh, hey, new boss,

17:32.111 --> 17:33.612
we're gonna need
a different plan.

17:33.712 --> 17:35.413
Right.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.536

18:05.377 --> 18:08.439
I'm doing great, Aunt G.
I'll be done here in a second.

18:08.539 --> 18:11.322
Oh, uh, just real quick
before I forget.

18:11.422 --> 18:14.244
Um, I might have to cut
some of Augie's weekend hours

18:14.344 --> 18:17.466
in order to make room
in the schedule for yours.

18:19.188 --> 18:22.891
Yeah. Your dad,
he kind of made me promise him

18:22.991 --> 18:26.213
to make you work
at least one weekend shift.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.495
-So, sorry about that.
-Great.

18:28.595 --> 18:31.337
So he's officially treating me
like a five-year-old.

18:31.438 --> 18:33.439
As if making me work here
wasn't enough.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.783
-Not that I don't love
working here.
-No. I get it.

18:38.883 --> 18:40.585
Bussing tables
isn't your dream job.

18:40.685 --> 18:44.708
I mean, I'm 18, and I just
graduated from high school.

18:44.808 --> 18:48.151
How could I possibly know what
my dream job is supposed to be?

18:48.251 --> 18:50.553
You can't, and that's okay.

18:50.653 --> 18:53.315
Yeah, tell that to my dad.
He had no clue what he wanted

18:53.415 --> 18:54.916
to do after high school.

18:55.016 --> 18:58.639
And Uncle Liam said
he always wanted to be a lawyer,

18:58.739 --> 19:01.161
but now
even he's changed his mind.

19:01.261 --> 19:04.484
I wish there were
some Walker footsteps

19:04.584 --> 19:06.965
that I actually wanted
to follow in.

19:07.066 --> 19:08.967
Well, Stel, you are forgetting

19:09.067 --> 19:12.290
about one
very important Walker.

19:12.390 --> 19:15.572
-Your mum.
-Well, she was
a social worker, right?

19:15.672 --> 19:18.995
-That was her dream job?
-It didn't start out that way.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.622
(neighs softly)

19:27.722 --> 19:29.583
(neighs loudly)

19:29.683 --> 19:32.706
He can be
a stubborn ass sometimes.

19:32.806 --> 19:34.807
Reminds me of somebody.

19:36.088 --> 19:37.990
See, this is another thing
I wish I could

19:38.090 --> 19:39.391
talk to my brother about.

19:39.491 --> 19:42.574
You know?

19:44.615 --> 19:46.477
You know, he, um...

19:46.577 --> 19:48.959
he went undercover
a couple years back.

19:49.059 --> 19:51.961
He was gone for,
you know, ten months.

19:52.061 --> 19:53.802
And, uh, when he came back,

19:53.902 --> 19:55.484
he had to recertify
with the Rangers,

19:55.584 --> 19:58.766
and he was really struggling
with this...

19:58.866 --> 20:01.929
basic equestrian course.

20:02.029 --> 20:04.931
He had to overcome
this emotional block

20:05.031 --> 20:07.213
that he had with...

20:07.313 --> 20:09.935
horses.

20:10.035 --> 20:13.818
I just wish that I could, uh...

20:13.918 --> 20:15.660
wish that I could talk
to my brother about this

20:15.760 --> 20:17.381
and not a horse.

20:17.481 --> 20:18.822
Didn't you tell me
your brother didn't want

20:18.922 --> 20:20.423
to have anything
to do with this?

20:20.523 --> 20:24.387
Isn't that kind of
the whole reason you're here?

20:24.487 --> 20:27.849
-Yep.
-Yeah.

20:32.053 --> 20:33.834
Hey, Chelsea, um,

20:33.934 --> 20:35.395
you wouldn't happen to have a...

20:35.495 --> 20:37.437
-a sugar cube or something?
-(chuckles)

20:37.537 --> 20:39.538
Yeah.

20:42.060 --> 20:44.102
Open heart.
And grateful.

21:00.155 --> 21:02.256
Good job.

21:02.356 --> 21:03.778
CASSIE:
Cap?

21:03.878 --> 21:05.939
Sorry to barge in, but...

21:06.039 --> 21:08.421
-(door closes)
-See something, say something?

21:08.521 --> 21:11.263
Yeah. That thing
Walker said last night,

21:11.364 --> 21:13.425
and that weird look on his face?

21:13.525 --> 21:14.906
Yeah, I noticed it, too.

21:15.006 --> 21:16.708
Should we be worried?
I mean, Walker usually...

21:16.808 --> 21:19.090
Hey, guys,
I think I found something.

21:27.216 --> 21:29.718
I finally convinced the Feds
to pool all their evidence

21:29.818 --> 21:31.519
-and share it with me.
-Really?

21:31.619 --> 21:33.001
Now there's not a ton to go on,

21:33.101 --> 21:34.482
but there's two
different receipts

21:34.582 --> 21:36.123
for the same coffee drink--

21:36.223 --> 21:38.645
a chocolate chip ice blended
with light whip

21:38.745 --> 21:40.847
from two different
Jaxon Java coffee trucks

21:40.947 --> 21:42.688
on two different days.

21:42.788 --> 21:45.651
Now, one of the coffee trucks
was parked over here.

21:45.751 --> 21:48.693
The other one, over here.

21:48.793 --> 21:50.975
Both of them are only
a few miles from two

21:51.075 --> 21:53.457
of the federal corrals
that our crew already hit.

21:53.557 --> 21:55.458
JAMES:
Interesting.
Okay, so your theory is

21:55.558 --> 21:56.979
every time
these guys hit a kill pen,

21:57.080 --> 21:58.701
they go to a nearby
Jaxon's Java

21:58.801 --> 22:00.582
and get an ice-blended coffee?

22:00.682 --> 22:02.584
I know this is thin,
but there are two more

22:02.684 --> 22:05.866
Jaxon Java coffee trucks
in this area right here,

22:05.967 --> 22:08.749
which is only a few miles
from this corral over here,

22:08.849 --> 22:11.191
which they have not hit yet.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.913
This right here--
this could be their next target.

22:14.013 --> 22:16.515
-Could be.
-A-All right, look, Cap.

22:16.615 --> 22:18.156
You're always saying
that a Ranger's got

22:18.256 --> 22:20.398
to trust his gut, right?

22:20.498 --> 22:21.919
Using my own words against me.

22:22.019 --> 22:23.520
-Nice. Nice.
-Mm.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.082
So if I don't listen,
it's like I'm a hypocrite.

22:25.182 --> 22:27.403
That's good, man. You're
learning. All right, look,

22:27.504 --> 22:29.365
you guys go ahead, I'll grab
Walker, we'll meet you there.

22:29.465 --> 22:30.486
-All right?
-Yes, sir.

22:30.586 --> 22:32.207
-Let's bring it in.
-Mm.

22:32.307 --> 22:34.689
Rangers on three.
One, two, three.

22:34.789 --> 22:36.931
-Rangers!
-Come on, dude.

22:37.031 --> 22:38.772
-Wha... Are you serious?
-I told you he'd do it.

22:38.872 --> 22:40.254
-You did.
-I told you he'd do it.

22:40.354 --> 22:42.836
-You said he would do it.
-That's dirty. Oh.

22:49.841 --> 22:52.543
WALKER (on comms):
All right, folks,
Ranger Walker here

22:52.643 --> 22:54.745
with a friendly reminder.
We got a BOLO

22:54.845 --> 22:57.587
for a late-model pickup,
dark in colour.

22:57.687 --> 23:00.590
May or may not still be hitched
to a stock trailer.

23:00.690 --> 23:02.351
No sign of 'em over here
at the coffee truck.

23:02.451 --> 23:05.874
Oh, it's like finding
a needle in a stack of needles.

23:05.974 --> 23:07.995
JAMES:
All right,
just take it slow, people.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.718
If they're nearby, I don't
want you guys to miss 'em.

23:10.818 --> 23:13.720
Roger that, Cap.
Slow is smooth.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.681
And smooth is fast.

23:15.782 --> 23:17.683

they're spilling ♪

23:17.783 --> 23:19.805

23:19.905 --> 23:21.926

I think I might have something.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.207
It's a silver pickup.

23:23.307 --> 23:24.568
Late model.

23:24.669 --> 23:26.690
Horse trailer's
already hitched up.

23:26.790 --> 23:28.131
Okay, what kind of trailer--
gooseneck,

23:28.231 --> 23:29.652
bumper pull-- and how big?

23:29.753 --> 23:31.614
Gooseneck trailer.

23:31.714 --> 23:35.417
No living quarters.
It's approximately...

23:35.517 --> 23:37.579
-25 feet long.
-Means it could carry

23:37.679 --> 23:38.780
at least a dozen horses.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.301
Which must be what

23:40.401 --> 23:41.402
-our suspects are using.
-JAMES: Okay. Trey,

23:41.482 --> 23:42.242
we're gonna need a positive ID

23:42.322 --> 23:43.223
before we move in.

23:43.323 --> 23:44.424
Can you confirm?

23:44.524 --> 23:45.865
It's a busted
side-view mirror.

23:45.965 --> 23:47.266
The police report stated

23:47.366 --> 23:49.548
that the suspects
sideswiped a barn hand,

23:49.648 --> 23:51.109
and nearly broke his shoulder.

23:51.209 --> 23:53.832
This has to be it.
This is their truck. We got 'em.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.633
Good work, Trey.
Uh, we're en route.

23:55.733 --> 23:59.056
(laughter)

24:05.981 --> 24:07.082
(whoops)

24:07.182 --> 24:08.723
Whoa.

24:08.823 --> 24:11.766
Well, it looks like

24:11.866 --> 24:15.128
somebody has finally
taken a shine to you.

24:15.228 --> 24:16.690
-(both laughing)
-Well,

24:16.790 --> 24:18.971
carrots definitely helped.

24:19.071 --> 24:20.533
So does your attitude.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.814
-(chuckles softly)
-You've made

24:21.914 --> 24:24.095
some good progress, Liam.

24:24.195 --> 24:26.197
Should be proud of yourself.

24:27.038 --> 24:29.720
You know? There you go.

24:31.441 --> 24:33.443
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

24:36.205 --> 24:39.888
Is everything, uh,
all right, Chelsea?

24:40.889 --> 24:43.110
Yeah.

24:43.210 --> 24:45.712
And... (sighs) no.

24:45.813 --> 24:48.114
See, my partner got

24:48.214 --> 24:50.876
the career opportunity
of her lifetime.

24:50.977 --> 24:53.799
But the catch is
it's way up in Michigan.

24:53.899 --> 24:55.760
So...

24:55.860 --> 24:58.322
I'm gonna be moving on here
pretty soon,

24:58.422 --> 25:02.606
along with Ol' Kenny and
the rest of my therapy animals.

25:02.706 --> 25:04.727
As in...

25:04.827 --> 25:07.149
this is it?

25:08.150 --> 25:11.573
Now, look,
I'm gonna give you the name

25:11.673 --> 25:13.775
of some other equine therapists
you can call.

25:13.875 --> 25:16.337
And please,

25:16.437 --> 25:19.939
just find a way
to keep doing this.

25:20.039 --> 25:22.962
This is clearly doing you good.

-Mm-hmm.

26:07.557 --> 26:10.779

we would all ditch class,

and we'd meet up
at that old diner on 6th.

26:13.201 --> 26:15.223

and Uncle Hoyt were crazy,

26:15.323 --> 26:16.704

26:16.804 --> 26:19.666
Your mum? Oh, my God, yeah.

26:19.767 --> 26:22.108
She was just a lot smarter
about it than the guys.

26:22.208 --> 26:24.030
-(laughs)
-She never got caught.

26:24.130 --> 26:27.673
It's so hard to picture you guys
as teenagers,

26:27.773 --> 26:29.714
or even, like,
normal human beings.

26:29.814 --> 26:33.077
Yeah, your mum was just...

26:33.177 --> 26:36.840
She was just kind of good
at everything, you know?

26:36.940 --> 26:38.882
Which put a lot
of pressure on her.

26:38.982 --> 26:41.684
And her dad-- he really
wanted her to go to law school.

26:41.784 --> 26:45.527
So, she thought that
that's what she wanted.

26:45.627 --> 26:49.050
I cannot picture Mum
as a lawyer at all.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.852
What happened?

26:51.952 --> 26:53.453
9/11 happened.

26:53.553 --> 26:55.254
Changed everything.

26:55.355 --> 26:57.176
It made her take stock.

26:57.276 --> 27:00.379
She realised that corporate law
wasn't her dream

27:00.479 --> 27:02.780
because it wasn't her passion.

27:02.881 --> 27:05.463
And I feel like it, you know,

27:05.563 --> 27:07.944
took a few years
for her to figure out what was.

27:08.045 --> 27:12.228
It's weird. I've...
I've literally never thought

27:12.328 --> 27:15.110
about what my parents lives
were like at my age.

27:15.210 --> 27:18.353
The world is full
of opportunities.

27:18.453 --> 27:21.075
Incredible opportunities,
Stella.

27:21.175 --> 27:25.478
You just... you have
to give yourself enough time

27:25.578 --> 27:28.641
and enough space
to find the right one.

27:28.741 --> 27:30.742
For you.

27:31.703 --> 27:33.645
But it's out there.

27:33.745 --> 27:35.746

What's your 20, Rangers?

27:42.031 --> 27:43.533
Yeah, coming to you.

27:43.633 --> 27:45.634
Wait for us to get back, Trey.

27:46.275 --> 27:48.276
Gonna be a minute.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.021
-(engine starts)
-Don't have a minute.

27:54.121 --> 27:55.662
We need to catch 'em
in the act, Cap.

27:55.762 --> 27:58.364
Hey, you heard me.
You're not a Ranger yet. Wait.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.649
They're taking off, man.

28:07.411 --> 28:09.413
Whoa.

28:16.018 --> 28:18.100
Get in. Let's go.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.113
All right, y'all load 'em up.

28:43.079 --> 28:44.060
Guys, what's your ETA?

28:44.160 --> 28:45.581
Trey, we're four minutes out.

28:45.682 --> 28:46.702
-All right, listen up, man.
-I'm sorry,

28:46.802 --> 28:47.823
Cap, but I had to do something.

28:47.923 --> 28:49.024
I couldn't just let these guys

28:49.124 --> 28:50.545
take off and get away.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.667
I know I put my promotion
at risk, but...

28:52.767 --> 28:54.148
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, I want you

28:54.248 --> 28:56.470
to keep this line open
and listen to my orders.

28:56.570 --> 28:58.191
-Roger that, Cap.
-WALKER: Hey, Trey,

28:58.291 --> 28:59.873
-can you stall them?
-There's no time.

28:59.973 --> 29:01.314
These guys are about
to hightail it right now, Cap.

29:01.414 --> 29:03.075
What do you want me to do?

29:03.175 --> 29:04.276
One second.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.558
Cap, it's your call, obviously.

29:06.658 --> 29:09.400
But for the record,
I think he can handle it.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.282
-I second that.
-TREY: Cap?

29:11.382 --> 29:12.563
-All right.
-Cap?

29:12.663 --> 29:14.844
All right, Trey, listen up.

29:14.945 --> 29:16.686
It's still your case,
so it's your call.

29:16.786 --> 29:19.088
If it looks like they're going
to get away, you think

29:19.188 --> 29:21.250
you can stop 'em, then do it.
Don't wait for us. Clear?

29:21.350 --> 29:23.411
Yes, sir. Crystal.

29:23.511 --> 29:24.732
Out.

29:24.832 --> 29:27.955

of that trailer, Barnett.

-Now, Captain...
-No, no, no.

32:03.838 --> 32:06.640

intuitively

32:15.327 --> 32:17.348
when and when not
to push the envelope.

they would have done the exact
same thing you did.

they're not for you.

They're for Liam.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.634

You're kidding, right?

33:15.734 --> 33:18.056
No, I'm serious.

33:19.938 --> 33:21.199
You know, I've seen
just how much

33:21.299 --> 33:22.840
equine therapy
has been helping you,

33:22.940 --> 33:26.363
and I figured maybe a few
more ponies couldn't hurt.

33:26.463 --> 33:27.964
You have no idea
how perfect this is, the timing.

33:28.064 --> 33:30.806
I mean, my-my therapist
is getting ready to move,

33:30.906 --> 33:33.048
but with these new horses,
I mean,

33:33.148 --> 33:35.730
I could start a therapy program
at the Davidson's barn.

33:35.830 --> 33:37.572
That's a hell of a lot
to take on, a lot to...

33:37.672 --> 33:39.693
a lot to learn.

33:39.793 --> 33:41.775
It's worth a shot, right?
I mean...

33:41.875 --> 33:44.057
-surrounded by experts.
-Well...

33:44.157 --> 33:46.939
And, Stella, you have experience
with a rescue horse. I mean,

33:47.039 --> 33:48.500
you could be a part
of this, too.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.742
We could be Walker Rescues.

33:50.842 --> 33:53.024
Gale Davidson said she was
gonna start a horse rescue.

33:53.124 --> 33:55.486
Why not make good
on that promise?

33:56.727 --> 33:58.628
I got to go check the smoker.

33:58.728 --> 34:00.229
Hey, stinker, uh,
hang back a sec.

34:00.329 --> 34:01.430
Uh...

34:01.530 --> 34:02.511
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:02.611 --> 34:04.753
Cordi, thank you.

34:04.853 --> 34:06.835
-Truly, I...
-You're welcome.

34:06.935 --> 34:08.756
-I don't know what I...
-No, you don't-you don't

34:08.856 --> 34:10.437
have to... you don't have to...
you don't have to say anything.

34:10.537 --> 34:13.039
You don't have to do anything.
I want to say something.

34:13.140 --> 34:15.141
I, um...

34:16.502 --> 34:18.164
I want to help you.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.725
Of course I do.

34:19.825 --> 34:22.007
I just don't always know how.

34:22.107 --> 34:23.808
You know?

34:23.908 --> 34:25.930
And I know this may not be
what you wanted

34:26.030 --> 34:29.212
from me, but I'm-I'm hoping
it's what you needed.

34:29.312 --> 34:32.215
Just do me a favour
and take it slowly.

34:32.315 --> 34:34.737
Last thing you need
is more stress right now.

34:34.837 --> 34:37.219
I-I know you're still, uh...

34:37.319 --> 34:39.761
I know you're still struggling,
little brother.

34:41.722 --> 34:43.463
Thank you, big brother.

34:43.564 --> 34:45.925
I, uh, I do need this.

34:48.247 --> 34:51.210
I can't keep relying on you
to make me feel better.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.293
Thanks.

35:11.546 --> 35:13.887
So, how was school?

35:13.987 --> 35:15.889
It was school.
Now, can you just

35:15.989 --> 35:17.991
drive me home, please?

35:18.631 --> 35:20.813
No, actually, I can't.

35:20.913 --> 35:24.015
Uh, yeah, Stella,
there-there's cars behind us.

35:24.115 --> 35:26.517
We kinda have to go.

35:28.279 --> 35:31.021
Yeah, why-why... why do we
need Dad's bobblehead?

35:31.121 --> 35:32.942
Because Mum gave it to him

35:33.043 --> 35:34.904
when she taught him
to drive stick in this car,

35:35.004 --> 35:36.505
and Dad did the same
when he taught me.

35:36.605 --> 35:38.987
It's kind of like
a Walker family tradition.

35:39.087 --> 35:40.749
And now, since it's your turn...

35:40.849 --> 35:41.990
Wait, do I get to
drive the car?

35:42.090 --> 35:44.091
Slide over.

35:50.576 --> 35:52.478
Just remember to slowly
ease off the clutch,

35:52.578 --> 35:55.360
-like I showed you.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.462
And no, you still
can't have my room.

35:58.463 --> 36:00.784
Okay, cool.
For sure.

36:01.825 --> 36:03.567
(engine starts)

36:03.667 --> 36:05.668
(revving)

36:12.033 --> 36:14.035
(laughing)

36:19.519 --> 36:21.461
-CASSIE: Hey.
-Cass, hey.

36:21.561 --> 36:24.123
God, you're still here.
You must have missed me.

36:25.324 --> 36:26.505
All right.

36:26.605 --> 36:28.226
You were right.

36:28.326 --> 36:31.749
Okay. Well, there are
a multitude of subjects

36:31.849 --> 36:33.310
that could apply to,
so you're gonna have to be

36:33.410 --> 36:35.412
a tad more specific.

36:36.533 --> 36:40.075
The other night
at the... at the stakeout.

36:40.175 --> 36:42.437
Cass, I-I saw that look

36:42.537 --> 36:45.039
between you and James.

36:45.139 --> 36:46.480
Okay, Walker, look, I just...

36:46.580 --> 36:49.122
And I know
that you're concerned.

36:49.223 --> 36:50.804
But you don't need to be.

36:50.904 --> 36:53.686
I mean, am I-am I struggling
with some things? Sure.

36:53.786 --> 36:55.608
But I'm not...

36:55.708 --> 36:58.690
consumed by them.

36:58.790 --> 37:01.092
Cass, I will always

37:01.192 --> 37:03.534
be cards-up with you, okay?

37:03.634 --> 37:06.216
And I'll always have your back.
I promise.

37:06.316 --> 37:08.137
Thank you for sharing that.

37:08.238 --> 37:10.980
-I know th...
-I'd like to show you something.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.081
Yeah.

37:14.963 --> 37:16.864
(sighs)

37:16.964 --> 37:19.226
This belonged

37:19.326 --> 37:21.888
to a fellow Marine.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.691
Uh, this...

37:28.614 --> 37:31.856
...belonged to Gunnery Sergeant
Clay Cooper.

37:32.857 --> 37:35.159
Um, Coop...

37:35.259 --> 37:37.421
was, uh...

37:38.822 --> 37:40.823
...was my mentor.

37:41.544 --> 37:44.326
Coop was my, uh...

37:44.426 --> 37:46.428
he was my best friend.

37:48.870 --> 37:50.411
Coop was killed in action,

37:50.511 --> 37:53.213
uh, which is ultimately why

37:53.313 --> 37:55.935
I, uh, traded in my dog tags

37:56.035 --> 37:58.037
for a badge.

38:04.082 --> 38:06.944
I've never told anyone that.
Not even my family.

38:07.044 --> 38:11.708
I just kind of tamped it down,
you know, just, uh...

38:11.808 --> 38:13.809
just compartmentalised it.

38:16.331 --> 38:18.333
(clears throat)

38:18.733 --> 38:20.995
I think, uh...
(clears throat)

38:21.095 --> 38:23.957
I think captivity

38:24.057 --> 38:26.079
just brought it all
back to the surface.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.721
CASSIE:
I know you probably don't want
to hear this right now,

38:28.821 --> 38:32.484
but if this flag
means this much to you,

38:32.584 --> 38:34.566
just think about
what it could mean

38:34.666 --> 38:36.667
to your buddy's family.

38:40.510 --> 38:42.051
Cass, it's complicated.

38:42.152 --> 38:44.493
No, it's-it's really not.
It's actually pretty simple.

38:44.593 --> 38:46.095
You just

38:46.195 --> 38:49.177
drive over there
and knock on the door.

38:49.277 --> 38:51.339
(chuckles softly)

38:51.439 --> 38:53.500
Hey.

38:53.601 --> 38:55.882
I got your back, partner.

39:15.858 --> 39:17.860
Ma'am, uh...

39:18.620 --> 39:20.642
My name is, uh, Cordell Walker,

39:20.742 --> 39:23.764
a-and I, uh...

39:23.864 --> 39:26.046
I served with your son.

39:26.146 --> 39:28.328
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm not Mrs. Cooper.

39:28.428 --> 39:31.130
Unfortunately, she hasn't been
feeling very well lately.

39:31.230 --> 39:33.212
But I can go upstairs
and check.

39:33.312 --> 39:35.974
-Come on in.
-Sure. Uh, thanks.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.695
("What Are We Now"
by Sean Rowe playing)

39:37.795 --> 39:39.797
(clears throat)

Good to, um...

41:35.448 --> 41:38.571
Good to talk with her.

Thank you for suggesting this.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.755
(inhales)

41:44.855 --> 41:45.756
Anyway, I don't know
about you,

41:45.856 --> 41:48.799
but I am famished.

41:48.899 --> 41:50.900
Want to grab a bite?

41:51.541 --> 41:52.481
(laughs)

41:52.582 --> 41:54.643
-Oh, yeah.
-All right.

41:54.743 --> 41:56.325
(engine starts)

41:56.425 --> 41:58.426
Let's do it.
