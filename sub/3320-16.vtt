WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:04.961
You two have any
plans this weekend?

00:05.048 --> 00:07.442
I have to work Friday and
Saturday, but I have Sunday off.

00:07.529 --> 00:08.573
Oh. Bonnie?

00:08.660 --> 00:10.053
Nothing much going on. Why?

00:10.140 --> 00:11.924
Well, I was thinking
maybe Sunday,

00:12.012 --> 00:14.405
we drive down to Chowchilla
and visit Regina in jail.

00:14.492 --> 00:18.018
Oh, thisSunday.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.671
Oh, gosh, you know,

00:19.758 --> 00:21.543
I promised
Roscoe that he and I would...

00:21.630 --> 00:23.023
Wait. No. I promised him.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.850
CHRISTY: Both of us, actually.
Both of us

00:24.937 --> 00:26.722
as a family...
Together.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.463
...promised that we would,
uh, take Roscoe

00:28.550 --> 00:30.682
to the thing
that he wants to do.
Yeah.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.163
What'’s it called?Moo... The movies.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.078
Right, the movies.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.515
That'’s lovely.
Want to try again?

00:37.602 --> 00:39.648
Oh, don'’t make
me go to jail.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.085
I hate it there.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.174
Regina'’s been locked up
an entire year.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.089
Have you even visited her once?

00:46.176 --> 00:49.397
Excuse me, but I have had
my own share of problems.

00:49.484 --> 00:52.182
You know, we were homeless,
Violet gave her baby up

00:52.269 --> 00:54.706
for adoption,
Alvin died.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.056
No, no, I get that one.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.970
Alvin died.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.669
Yeah, and I have cancer,
and I visit her every month.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.888
Again with the cancer.

01:02.975 --> 01:05.021
This woman is a friend of ours.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.718
You helped her get sober.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.720
She was there for you
when you relapsed.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.200
Yeah, but isn'’t going
to visiting her

01:10.287 --> 01:11.723
like rubbing her
nose in our freedom?

01:11.810 --> 01:13.551
Mm. That'’s true.

01:13.638 --> 01:16.554
"Look at us, not having to trade
cigarettes for tampons."

01:16.641 --> 01:18.861
BONNIE:
Yeah.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.951
Or kisses for soap.

01:22.038 --> 01:24.562
8:00 a.m., Sunday.
You'’re driving.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.042
Excuse me.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.438
Okay, I know why
I don'’t want to go.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.613
I'’m a horrible,
selfish person.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.745
What'’s your story?

01:33.832 --> 01:35.443
I'’d rather not say.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.271
Oh, come on, she'’s
got a tiny bladder.

01:37.358 --> 01:40.709
She'’ll be back
in 30 seconds.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.058
All right.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.060
[clears her throat]

01:44.147 --> 01:46.541
Remember the box of cash
Regina entrusted me with?

01:46.628 --> 01:48.282
Yeah?

01:48.369 --> 01:50.588
She shouldn'’t have.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.373
What did you do?

01:52.460 --> 01:54.244
Don'’t blame me,
blame the Green Bay Packers.

01:54.331 --> 01:55.550
Oh, Christy!

01:55.637 --> 01:57.247
All year they cover the spread

01:57.334 --> 01:58.988
except for the one weekend
I needed them to.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.251
So you not only gambled
away all of our money,

02:01.338 --> 02:02.774
but also Regina'’s?

02:02.861 --> 02:04.689
Okay, first of all,

02:04.776 --> 02:07.257
I gambled away Regina'’s money
six, seven months

02:07.344 --> 02:08.476
before I blew ours.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.261
And let'’s not forget...

02:11.348 --> 02:13.307
Regina stole that money.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.091
What'’s your point?

02:15.178 --> 02:17.485
I don'’t want to see Regina.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.114
So, what time you think
you'’ll be back?

02:38.201 --> 02:39.855
It'’ll probably be late.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.944
How late?
I don'’t know--
9:00 or 10:00.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.989
So... 9:30?

02:44.076 --> 02:46.166
Oh, just use a condom and
don'’t smoke pot in the house.

02:47.732 --> 02:48.907
[coughing]

02:48.994 --> 02:50.474
[groaning]:
Oh, God,

02:50.561 --> 02:52.084
I feel terrible.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.739
Might be the flu.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.088
[Christy sniffles]

02:56.176 --> 02:57.699
I really want to go see Regina,

02:57.786 --> 02:59.570
but I think
I should go to the doctor.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.920
I think you should
go to acting classes.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.574
What?

03:03.661 --> 03:05.489
Get dressed.
I'’m not doing this alone.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.187
[sighs] Fine, whatever.

03:08.623 --> 03:11.060
[doorbell rings]

03:11.147 --> 03:13.541
Roscoe, your dad'’s here.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.371
Morning! You remember Candace.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.676
Hi, you.

03:18.763 --> 03:21.026
Hi.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.419
Come on in.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.421
Oh, thanks.
[squeals, laughs]

03:24.508 --> 03:25.857
Oh.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.642
We'’re hugging now.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.426
Yeah.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.736
Christy, your house is so cozy.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.826
It must be super easy
for you to keep it clean, huh?

03:38.914 --> 03:40.132
Or not.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.746
So, what do you guys
have planned for today?

03:44.833 --> 03:47.139
Oh, we'’re just gonna have brunch
with Daddy at the club.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.577
That'’s nice.
What about your mother?

03:49.664 --> 03:51.796
Yeah. What about her?

03:51.883 --> 03:53.407
That'’s okay.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.365
I have one of those, too.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.151
I'’m playing golf
with her dad after.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.066
I'’m down to a 17 handicap.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.243
Mm! I'’ve known
about your handicap for years.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.680
I never knew it had a number.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.292
And-and you?

04:09.379 --> 04:11.773
Oh, my mother and I
are visiting a friend

04:11.860 --> 04:13.601
who'’s been going
through a tough time.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.820
Oh, I'’m sorry.
What'’s going on?

04:15.907 --> 04:17.952
Well, the truth is,

04:18.040 --> 04:22.130
she embezzled several million
dollars, and she'’s in jail.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.264
Wow.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.744
You know, I'’ve never known
anyone who'’s been to jail.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.180
Yeah, you do.
You live with him.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.621
Roscoe, we'’ll meet you
in the car!

04:35.362 --> 04:36.972
It'’s actually
a very funny story.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.104
Oh, we'’ll talk
at home.
Yeah.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.853
You gambled away all her money?

04:48.940 --> 04:51.160
Not allof it.

04:51.247 --> 04:55.120
I used some of it to buy
the NFL package on satellite TV.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.820
Christy, she was counting
on that money

04:58.907 --> 05:00.691
to live on when she gets out.

05:00.778 --> 05:03.128
I know!
That'’s why I'’ve been saving,

05:03.215 --> 05:04.869
a little each month,

05:04.956 --> 05:07.045
so she has it
when her sentence is up.

05:07.132 --> 05:08.438
How much have you saved so far?

05:08.525 --> 05:10.788
Back off!

05:10.875 --> 05:12.268
So...

05:12.355 --> 05:14.662
how'’s Regina been doing in jail?

05:14.749 --> 05:16.838
She had a rough go of it
for the first few months,

05:16.925 --> 05:18.796
then she seemed
to find her way.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.407
She got a wife?

05:20.494 --> 05:23.627
It'’s prison,
not a prison movie.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.455
I think
she might be banging a guard.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.416
She still sober?

05:29.503 --> 05:31.331
Oh, yeah.
Even runs her own meeting.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.723
I'’ve been to it.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.986
We get it, you visit.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.640
I took the bus.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.775
And you have cancer.

05:40.862 --> 05:44.039
Next time you see a rest stop,
we need to pull over.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.736
There goes that tiny bladder.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.396
They have vending machines
where you did time?

05:53.483 --> 05:55.398
Mm. We had a
woman named Mike.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.619
She got you anything you wanted,
but you had to let her do stuff

05:58.706 --> 06:01.012
that made her feel
like her name was Mike.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.624
I'’ll never forget
my first night.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.669
I was scared to death.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.279
How long before you settled in?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.803
Never did.
Stayed scared the whole time.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.718
Did you gang up?Didn'’t have to.

06:10.805 --> 06:13.373
My first day, I walked up
to the biggest bull in the yard

06:13.460 --> 06:15.375
and beat the crap out of her
with my shoe.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.419
Really?

06:16.506 --> 06:17.551
Mm.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.553
Wow.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.859
Snickers?

06:21.946 --> 06:24.166
Thank you.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.776
Hey.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.909
Nobody likes a drum solo.

06:27.996 --> 06:30.041
Sorry. I'’m just...

06:30.128 --> 06:31.303
[clears her throat]

06:31.391 --> 06:32.696
...really nervous.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.306
I did something horrible.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.613
So did most
of the people in this room.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.268
Do you think she'’s gonna ask
about the money?

06:39.355 --> 06:41.792
I would.

06:41.879 --> 06:44.708
Regina'’s just going to be happy
to see her friends.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.797
And you.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.190
There they are!

06:48.277 --> 06:49.713
Oh, hey, you.Hey!

06:49.800 --> 06:51.236
Oh, look who I brought.

06:51.323 --> 06:54.065
Hey, baby.
Hi.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.981
Regina.
Bonnie.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.897
Ooh. Sorry I was late,
but I got big news.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.508
So does Christy.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.164
What'’s your news?

07:06.251 --> 07:07.949
I just found out
I made early parole.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.559
I'’m getting out
in two weeks!
Ooh!

07:11.039 --> 07:12.344
Wow.
Man!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.521
Your news just got
more compelling.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.960
You think I could stay with you
until I find a place?

07:19.047 --> 07:20.265
It won'’t be long.

07:20.352 --> 07:24.444
I have some
money set aside.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.968
You can stay with me
as long as you need.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.100
Oh, thank you.

07:29.187 --> 07:30.667
Christy, you okay?

07:30.754 --> 07:33.278
You look a little
whiter than usual.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.150
I'’m fine.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.979
I'’m just so... happy for you.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.023
Oh.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.329
Thank you, baby.

07:40.416 --> 07:41.678
I'’ve been talking to my lawyer,

07:41.765 --> 07:43.550
and she thinks
that in a few years,

07:43.637 --> 07:45.334
I can get my CPA license back.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.336
Till then, I can
live off that money,

07:47.423 --> 07:49.077
focus on getting
my son back,

07:49.164 --> 07:50.470
maybe find work
as a bookkeeper...

07:50.557 --> 07:51.688
You have no money!

07:53.603 --> 07:54.996
[sighs]
What?!

07:55.083 --> 07:56.780
I'’m sorry.

07:56.867 --> 07:57.955
I am so sorry.

07:58.042 --> 07:58.869
What did you do?

07:58.956 --> 08:00.131
Take off your shoe.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.833
I... lost it all gambling.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.834
[Bonnie gasps dramatically]

08:06.921 --> 08:11.186
Christy, you didn'’t!

08:11.273 --> 08:12.666
So it'’s all gone?

08:12.753 --> 08:13.971
Mm-hmm.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.407
Well, you know what?

08:16.539 --> 08:18.019
What?

08:18.106 --> 08:21.022
Hallelujah.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.067
Halle-what?

08:23.154 --> 08:24.982
Oh, baby, that was dirty money

08:25.069 --> 08:27.550
which the Lord deemed
fit to take away.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.421
I thought
it was the Green Bay Packers

08:29.509 --> 08:31.336
minus three that took it away.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.424
No, it was Jesus.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.818
Here I was, planning on
spending that stolen money,

08:35.905 --> 08:38.866
continuing to live in sin.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.693
And now that temptation
has been removed,

08:40.780 --> 08:43.871
because once again,
God has done for me

08:43.957 --> 08:47.178
what I could not
do for myself.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.790
I'’m sorry,
is this some sort of a skit?

08:51.661 --> 08:54.011
Hang on, Mom.

08:54.098 --> 08:57.319
If Regina found the Lord,
we should be happy for her.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.103
Way to go.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.672
Let'’s all hold
hands and pray.

09:04.282 --> 09:07.547
[no voice]

09:07.634 --> 09:10.898
Lord God, I want to thank you

09:10.985 --> 09:15.076
for my freedom, my friends,
my sobriety and my life.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.208
Also,

09:17.295 --> 09:18.819
thank you for using Christy

09:18.906 --> 09:20.908
to liberate me
from that evil money.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.474
Hear that?

09:22.562 --> 09:25.565
I'’m an instrument
of the Lord.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.525
Amen.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.796
I thought I hit bottom
when I got sent to prison,

09:39.883 --> 09:43.234
but turns out,
I wasn'’t even close.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.106
After those cold
steel gates

09:45.193 --> 09:48.849
slammed shut behind me,
I was so lonely and hopeless,

09:48.936 --> 09:51.286
I decided I might as well
start drinking again.

09:51.373 --> 09:54.681
I felt like that at rehab
when they took away my iPad.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.989
REGINA:
Now...

09:59.076 --> 10:00.948
for those of you
who haven'’t been to prison,

10:01.035 --> 10:03.428
you pretty much have two choices
when it comes to getting loaded:

10:03.515 --> 10:05.779
Toilet wine-- a lovely mixture

10:05.866 --> 10:09.260
of moldy bread, rotted fruit,
and ketchup.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.088
Ketchup makes
it a rosé.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.005
And, of course, heroin,

10:15.092 --> 10:17.399
smuggled via somebody'’s
boyfriend'’s poop chute.

10:17.486 --> 10:18.792
In either case,

10:18.879 --> 10:23.100
you really gotta want it.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.102
And I did.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.496
But for some reason,
before I picked up,

10:27.583 --> 10:31.021
I did something I hadn'’t done
since I was a little girl--

10:31.108 --> 10:34.285
I got down on my knees
and asked God for help.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.374
Didn'’t expect

10:36.461 --> 10:37.767
an immediate response.

10:37.854 --> 10:41.641
In fact, didn'’t expect anything.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.381
But then, bam!

10:48.560 --> 10:50.040
My cell...

10:50.127 --> 10:52.913
♪ Was bathed in holy light

10:54.479 --> 10:56.612
And I could feel His presence.

10:56.699 --> 10:59.702
The Spirit of the Lord
filled me up!

10:59.789 --> 11:02.313
[whispers]:
What do you think
happened next?

11:02.400 --> 11:03.837
I was saved.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.708
Oh.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.058
What need did I have
of drugs and alcohol

11:08.145 --> 11:11.192
when I had the power of God
rushin'’, ripplin'’,

11:11.279 --> 11:12.889
roarin'’through my veins!

11:12.976 --> 11:14.151
Testify!

11:18.112 --> 11:20.114
I now had the sweet joy
and the serenity

11:20.201 --> 11:22.420
I'’d been searching for every day
of my life.

11:22.507 --> 11:25.859
[quietly]:
I pray all the time
and that never happens to me.

11:25.946 --> 11:30.037
[quietly]:
That'’s because
you'’re not crazy.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.691
I finally understood

11:31.778 --> 11:34.389
that my purpose on this earth
was to serve God

11:34.476 --> 11:36.217
and spread His Word.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.001
And I have the power

11:38.088 --> 11:40.264
to do that because He...

11:40.351 --> 11:42.919
is within me.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.443
He'’s within all of us.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.271
Even the worst of us.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.717
Why'’s everybody looking at me?

12:01.459 --> 12:03.287
Can I just say one thing

12:03.374 --> 12:05.637
about that Sermon on the Mount
we had to sit through?

12:05.725 --> 12:10.251
I'’ve never known you to stop
at one thing, but okay.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.123
I didn'’t much like the Regina
that went into jail,

12:13.210 --> 12:15.560
but I can'’t stand
the one that came out.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.780
Really? I like her.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.042
Of course you like her.
She forgave you

12:19.129 --> 12:20.391
for blowing all her money.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.437
Okay, well...
[clears throat]

12:22.524 --> 12:24.569
yeah, that'’s part of it.

12:26.397 --> 12:29.444
But it also seems
like she'’s so happy now.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.098
Yeah. She just got out.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.013
Wait till the reality of life
hits her,

12:33.100 --> 12:35.319
and then watch that holy light
of God fade out

12:35.406 --> 12:37.147
like Tinker Bell
when the kids don'’t clap.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.847
You'’ll never believe
what just happened.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.153
I couldn'’t find a
parking space anywhere.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.068
Regina says this little prayer,

12:45.155 --> 12:48.376
next thing you know,
an SUV pulls out right in front

12:48.463 --> 12:50.770
of the restaurant
with time on the meter.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.033
Ask and ye shall receive.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.949
Hang on. So there'’s disease
and there'’s war

12:56.036 --> 12:57.646
and there'’s hunger,
but Jesus has time

12:57.733 --> 13:00.344
to find you
a parking space?

13:00.431 --> 13:03.391
With time on the meter.
Thank you, Jesus.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.307
And that'’s not all.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.223
After the meeting, a woman
came up to me and gave me a job

13:09.310 --> 13:10.964
doing bookkeeping,
which is what I prayed for.

13:11.051 --> 13:14.184
Thanks again.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.056
Good grief. You'’re like
a Puerto Rican shortstop

13:16.143 --> 13:17.709
who just hit a double.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.235
Why is it so hard for you
to believe

13:21.322 --> 13:23.063
God wants good things for us?

13:23.150 --> 13:24.673
I'’ll tell you why.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.762
Because He just took away
the man I love.

13:26.849 --> 13:27.763
Oh, yeah.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.069
Marjorie told me.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.159
I'’m so sorry.

13:32.246 --> 13:35.336
But the good news is,
he'’s in a better place.

13:35.423 --> 13:38.295
He was in bed with me
when he went-- top that.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.908
Bonnie, I understand
you'’re in pain,

13:41.995 --> 13:44.388
but you have to know
God has a plan.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.826
He took that man for a reason.All right,

13:46.913 --> 13:48.566
that'’s it-- I'’m out of here.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.482
Oh, Mom, come on.
We'’re all friends here.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.702
Help us celebrate
Regina being home.Sorry,

13:53.789 --> 13:56.748
but if I stay, I'’m gonna
break a commandment.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.838
One of the big ones.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.322
You and I are
still square, right?

14:08.282 --> 14:10.153
See you later.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.201
What are you
all dressed up for?

14:14.288 --> 14:15.985
Um...
[clears throat]

14:16.072 --> 14:18.553
Regina invited me
to go to church with her.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.598
And you'’re going?Why not?

14:20.685 --> 14:22.818
I'’ve always been curious
about the...

14:22.905 --> 14:25.690
United Westside African
Methodist Episcopal

14:25.777 --> 14:28.563
Holy Tabernacle Church of God.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.695
Seriously?

14:30.782 --> 14:34.134
I think a couple of them merged.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.614
I can'’t believe
you'’re buying into this.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.529
What is your problem with God?

14:38.616 --> 14:39.922
I don'’t have
a problem with God.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.316
I happen to be
a very spiritual person.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.971
My problem is with an ex-con
looking me in the eye

14:45.058 --> 14:46.537
and telling me I lost Alvin

14:46.624 --> 14:48.670
because God
has some freakin'’ plan.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.498
Well...

14:50.585 --> 14:52.456
maybe he does.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.241
Oh, sure.
Your father'’s in Heaven

14:54.328 --> 14:57.461
hammering out the dents
in God'’s Toyota Tundra.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.855
[sighs]
Okay, I know you'’re joking,

14:59.942 --> 15:02.379
but I find that very comforting.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.120
You would. Go to church.

15:04.207 --> 15:07.428
Okay, but just
so we'’re clear,

15:07.515 --> 15:09.952
I am only going
to support a friend.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.433
I'’m not looking
to turn into some kind of...

15:12.520 --> 15:14.261
born-again holy roller.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.089
Well, I find that
very comforting.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.569
Good. See you later.

Oh, thank you.

15:32.409 --> 15:35.369
So, what'’s up?Oh, nothing'’s up.

15:35.456 --> 15:38.676
Sometimes it'’s nice just to drop
by and say hi to a friend.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.809
No, it'’s not. What'’s up?

15:40.896 --> 15:43.290
Can I just have a sip of coffee?No,

15:43.377 --> 15:45.379
you got a tiny bladder.
What'’s up?

15:45.466 --> 15:47.207
Okay.

15:47.294 --> 15:50.036
First of all, I love Regina.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.952
No one is happier than me
that she'’s out of jail

15:53.039 --> 15:55.128
and she'’s sober.But?

15:55.215 --> 15:57.173
But if I have to live with her
one more day,

15:57.260 --> 15:59.523
I just might rip her throat out.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.961
There it is.
You need an alibi.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.964
No. I need her to stay with you
for a while.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.966
So I'’ll need an alibi.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.446
I'’m begging, Bonnie.
She'’s driving me crazy.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.926
Oh, is she now?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.842
It never stops.
Day in, day out,

16:13.929 --> 16:16.062
"Jesus loves me,"
"Jesus forgives me."

16:16.149 --> 16:18.716
It'’s more exhausting
than the chemo.

16:18.803 --> 16:22.198
Well, I am sorry, but there'’s no
way in hell she'’s staying here.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.374
[sighs]
What am I supposed to do?

16:24.461 --> 16:27.638
I don'’t know.
Ask God to take her away.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.597
I did. It'’s not working.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.555
[gasps]

16:31.642 --> 16:33.122
Hey, Marjorie!

16:33.209 --> 16:34.210
What'’s with the tambourine?

16:34.297 --> 16:35.820
I'’m in the junior choir!

You'’ll never guess
what happened after church.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.487
Christy and I
went out for coffee

16:50.574 --> 16:52.446
and ran into Jill here,

16:52.533 --> 16:55.057
who asked me to live with her
in her big, beautiful mansion.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.493
JILL:
I...

16:56.580 --> 16:58.017
hope you don'’t mind, Marjorie,

16:58.104 --> 16:59.757
but I could really use
the company.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.369
And the spiritual guidance.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.719
Well, I'’ll miss her...

17:04.806 --> 17:07.852
but if that'’s
what God wants.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.858
Wait a minute...

17:14.945 --> 17:16.686
Wait a minute.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.517
Wait... a minute.

17:22.301 --> 17:25.740
You got paroled
three years early,

17:25.827 --> 17:27.872
you'’ve been out two days,
during which time

17:27.959 --> 17:30.440
you got a good job
and you'’re living rent-free

17:30.527 --> 17:32.573
in a house
with a tennis court?

17:32.660 --> 17:35.706
Two courts. Grass and clay.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.754
And Jill'’s gonna let me
drive her old Range Rover.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.277
It'’s a 2013.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.975
The GPS is all weird.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.240

Not really.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.978
What are you doing here?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.240
Heard you were looking for me.

As a matter of fact, I am.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.592
Please.

Sure.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.398
So what'’s up?

19:04.273 --> 19:07.494
I want to know
why you took Alvin.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.670
It was his time.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.802
What does that mean?

19:11.889 --> 19:13.413
He needed to repair things

19:13.500 --> 19:15.632
with you and his daughter,
and he did.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.634
Then he could go.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.593
What about me?

19:19.680 --> 19:22.248
You still have work to do
with Christy.

19:22.335 --> 19:25.164
And Roscoe and Violet and...

19:25.251 --> 19:29.472
