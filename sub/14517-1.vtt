04:42.630 --> 04:44.790
Fall break, and here we sit.

04:46.180 --> 04:49.180
No plans, nothing to do.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.250
I've been warning you since September.

04:52.350 --> 04:55.380
Go to the beach,
go to the mountains, do something.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.340
Don't say I didn't tell you so.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.840
Well, why didn't you make
some reservations?

04:59.940 --> 05:00.970
I should have,

05:01.070 --> 05:03.450
but you guys never agree on anything.

05:04.110 --> 05:07.110
So, we'll sit around here
just like we did last year.

05:07.330 --> 05:09.080
It's depressing.

05:09.830 --> 05:12.460
Hey, Ed, uh, you have a telephone call.

05:13.540 --> 05:14.790
Right.

05:15.210 --> 05:17.170
No, seriously, you have a telephone call.

05:18.630 --> 05:20.050
Well, what do you know?

05:21.130 --> 05:23.300
Ralph said what he meant for a change.

05:27.090 --> 05:28.210
Yeah?

05:32.480 --> 05:33.730
My dad?

05:37.100 --> 05:39.180
Yeah, OK. Uh-huh.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.820
Well, anybody got
any good ideas for break?

05:43.070 --> 05:45.320
I'm gonna set a new high score
on the video machine.

05:45.530 --> 05:46.850
I'm gonna watch.

05:46.950 --> 05:47.950
How about you?

05:48.320 --> 05:51.900
Well, actually, I was relying on you
to make the arrangements.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.600
Oh, Ralph.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.110
Anybody got any paper?

05:55.210 --> 05:57.190
It's a message to call my dad.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.920
From a phone booth, for Christ's sakes.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.970
I thought Ed's father was dead.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.350
His mother is dead.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.210
God, it was a terrible accident, too.

06:11.470 --> 06:12.770
What happened?

06:13.890 --> 06:17.650
When he was a little boy,
Ed accidentally shot her.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.510
Oh, ho-ho, man...

06:20.270 --> 06:22.780
- Drove his father crazy.
- I can understand it.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.200
You know, I really can't...

06:26.450 --> 06:28.660
Dad?

06:31.450 --> 06:32.740
I don't believe it.

06:33.370 --> 06:34.370
Don't believe what?

06:35.160 --> 06:36.250
My old man.

06:36.370 --> 06:37.370
What's up?

06:37.920 --> 06:40.460
He's having another one of his spells.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.110
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, what kind of spells?

06:43.210 --> 06:44.800
The kind that come in bottles.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.530
Well, what's the problem?

06:47.630 --> 06:49.380
Will you let the man talk?

06:50.510 --> 06:53.330
He wants me to close up
his condo for the winter.

06:53.430 --> 06:55.210
Oh, that sounds like work.

06:55.310 --> 06:58.500
What's the matter?
Big strong you, afraid of a little work?

06:58.600 --> 07:02.210
Oh, he just has to save his strength
for more important things.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.020
- Right.
- It's not it.

07:04.400 --> 07:09.260
I mean, all my life the creep's ignored me,
and treated me like some redheaded bastard.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.560
Um...

07:10.660 --> 07:12.030
Oh, sorry.

07:13.410 --> 07:16.540
Now, all of a sudden, he calls me up
and asks me to do something.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.190
Tells me I'm old enough to
"take the responsibility."

07:20.290 --> 07:21.290
What'd you say?

07:21.420 --> 07:22.620
I told him to do his own work.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.840
What'd he say?

07:25.210 --> 07:27.920
He said if I didn't do it,
it wouldn't get done.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.040
"Face it like a man."

07:30.930 --> 07:33.310
And I'm not gonna do it.
I mean, what a jerk.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.100
How much work?

07:36.100 --> 07:38.580
"Turn off the water,
turn off the electricity,

07:38.680 --> 07:40.710
"pour some antifreeze in the plumbing."

07:40.810 --> 07:43.360
"Any 10-year-old can handle it."

08:03.460 --> 08:06.570
Uh, did you say,
any 10-year-old can handle it?

08:06.670 --> 08:08.360
- It's a snap.
- Nothing to it.

08:08.460 --> 08:09.370
We can handle that.

08:09.470 --> 08:11.910
Yeah, how come we didn't know
you had a condo at the beach?

08:12.010 --> 08:13.050
No way.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.370
What do you say?

08:15.470 --> 08:18.560
Four days of R&R at the beach.

08:18.810 --> 08:21.380
- I'm in.
- She's in, I'm in.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.480
Sounds good to me.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.110
I got a bad feeling about this.

08:42.539 --> 08:44.530
- Don't forget our arrangement.
- Oh!

08:44.630 --> 08:47.400
Oh, I'm sorry. Don't know
what I'm doing, you know? Just all...

08:47.500 --> 08:49.320
I really didn't mean to. OK?

08:49.420 --> 08:50.550
OK. Bye-bye.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.410
What's the matter, Ralph?

08:54.510 --> 08:56.580
Guys, Sue can't come.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.370
- No.
- Yeah.

08:58.470 --> 09:00.076
Something went wrong
with one of her exams,

09:00.100 --> 09:01.826
and she's just gonna
have to take it over again.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.100
- Oh, God.
- That's terrible.

09:03.270 --> 09:06.440
- Yeah...
- Get in. You can't let that spoil your trip.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.380
- Where are you going?
- I'm just going in to say goodbye.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.270
Hey, no, guys, I really
wouldn't feel right going without Sue.

09:13.530 --> 09:15.310
- Don't be a jerk.
- Get in the car.

09:15.410 --> 09:17.270
You're going. No backing out now.

09:17.370 --> 09:18.886
- No...
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

09:18.910 --> 09:20.440
Hey, there's Sue.

09:20.540 --> 09:22.440
Hi, guys. Sorry to keep you waiting.

09:22.540 --> 09:23.610
Hi, Sue.

09:23.710 --> 09:25.440
I'm really sorry you can't go.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.440
- Yeah, me too.
- Rotten luck.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.290
What're you guys talking about?

09:31.010 --> 09:32.450
- Ralph!
- Ooh! Oh, man!

09:32.550 --> 09:33.550
What a jerk.

09:34.510 --> 09:36.830
God, I believe him
every time, all the time.

09:36.930 --> 09:39.160
- Guys, gimme a break.
- Aw, Ralph.

09:39.260 --> 09:42.460
Besides, let's get this road trip...

09:42.560 --> 09:43.790
on the road!

09:43.890 --> 09:45.000
Break my car.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.860
That's OK, it's paid for.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.360
Come on.

09:51.150 --> 09:53.840
Man, this car's not convinced
we're going anywhere.

09:53.940 --> 09:56.470
So, my philosophy is,
let's have some beer.

10:03.830 --> 10:07.480

11:27.250 --> 11:28.670
Oh, man.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.670
Well, I think I'll go get some beer.

11:53.690 --> 11:55.130
Will that be all?

11:55.230 --> 11:56.380
Maybe.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.376
Hey, how old do you
have to be to get that discount?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.600
- 65.
- 65?

12:00.700 --> 12:02.600
Hey, man, now that's discrimination.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.600
- It is?
- It sure is.

12:04.700 --> 12:07.270
Look, I'm a law student,
so I ought to know.

12:07.370 --> 12:09.610
That discriminates against me
for being young.

12:09.710 --> 12:11.580
- It does?
- Well, sure it does.

12:11.710 --> 12:13.690
Look, tell you what I'm gonna do.

12:13.790 --> 12:15.940
If you'll give me that 10% discount,

12:16.040 --> 12:18.860
I'll go get another six-pack of beer,
and we'll both benefit.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.570
Now, what do you say to that?

12:20.670 --> 12:21.670
Sure.

12:30.270 --> 12:31.500
What took you so long?

12:31.600 --> 12:33.630
Oh, man, wait till you guys
hear about this one.

12:33.730 --> 12:35.090
This is great.

12:35.190 --> 12:37.510
They're always great...

12:37.610 --> 12:38.740
Oh, man.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.310
Another one of those
smart ass college kids,

12:43.410 --> 12:46.410
talking themselves into buying
two six-packs instead of one.

12:46.740 --> 12:47.740
Yep.

12:49.620 --> 12:52.940

14:35.930 --> 14:37.670
So, this is it, huh?

14:37.770 --> 14:40.610
The famous condo at the beach.

14:40.940 --> 14:42.670
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

14:42.770 --> 14:44.940
- Nah, it's not too bad.
- I kinda like it.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.376
All right, everybody,
let's get this stuff inside.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.010
Hey, Pam. Throw me the keys.

14:49.110 --> 14:50.690
Ooh, easy.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.490
Hey, Ralph. Catch!

14:54.120 --> 14:56.400
Hey, Ed. I don't need 'em.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.870
This place is wide open.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.690
- So, what's the hold up?
- Yeah.

15:01.790 --> 15:02.830
I don't know.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.510
Something just doesn't look right.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.910
It's nothing. Just a little mess.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.010
Come on in.

15:14.890 --> 15:16.850
Looks like we missed the party.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.090
I see my dad had a little help
bringing on his spell.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.640
What do you mean?

15:28.740 --> 15:31.010
Well, he likes to come down
with his drinking buddies

15:31.110 --> 15:33.810
and they swap lies about
the good old days when they were

15:33.910 --> 15:35.810
great white hunters and macho men.

15:35.910 --> 15:37.250
Macho, huh?

15:37.580 --> 15:38.870
Yeah.

15:39.580 --> 15:43.590
Dad used to tell me that he'd
hunted everything but man.

15:45.250 --> 15:47.620
How long do you think
it's been since they were here?

15:47.800 --> 15:51.550
I don't know. Last week,
last night, this morning maybe.

15:52.470 --> 15:53.750
I think we should call the cops.

15:53.850 --> 15:55.540
What if this place has been broken into?

15:55.640 --> 15:58.210
Yeah, what if they're still here?

15:58.310 --> 15:59.500
Cut it out, Ralph.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.790
Besides, there are no cops.

16:00.890 --> 16:01.890
No cops?

16:01.980 --> 16:04.840
Well, the cops on the mainland,
the Sheriff's Department?

16:04.940 --> 16:07.340
And they come over and patrol
like that guy on the bridge.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.850
There's almost always someone
on the beach patrolling though.

16:09.950 --> 16:11.010
Almost always?

16:11.110 --> 16:13.850
Great place to smuggle dope.

16:13.950 --> 16:15.140
I think we should report it.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.850
Yeah, how can you be sure
it's your old man?

16:17.950 --> 16:19.560
Look, nothing's missing.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.440
Let's just don't worry about it.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.820
Avoid the hassle.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.960
Hey, guys. Look at this stuff.

16:33.970 --> 16:36.870
Geez! Would you look at all this shit?

16:36.970 --> 16:38.680
Well, rah, rah.

16:39.470 --> 16:40.970
Look at this.

16:41.310 --> 16:42.770
That was a record.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.440
28 pounds.

16:44.980 --> 16:47.980
Mmm-mmm, I'll bet that was
good baked with a little lemon.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.820
Oh, Dad didn't eat it.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.950
He's what's called a trophy hunter.

16:53.660 --> 16:56.810
Well, looks like the party's over
for this joker.

16:56.910 --> 16:57.990
Ugh.

16:59.950 --> 17:02.990
Yeah... My dad ran over him
with a ski boat.

17:09.250 --> 17:10.579
An accident.

17:20.520 --> 17:21.930
What's this thing?

17:23.890 --> 17:25.460
Uh, that's a gaff.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.800
What's a gaff?

17:26.900 --> 17:30.760
When you're fishing, and you see a big
one up over the side of the boat,

17:30.860 --> 17:32.700
then you hook it in him.

17:33.490 --> 17:35.320
- Here.
- Real nice.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.460
I guess this is what he
caught that fish with.

17:44.710 --> 17:46.960
Nope. It's what he caught this girl with.

17:47.790 --> 17:49.190
How did you know it was a girl?

17:49.290 --> 17:50.360
Yeah.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.950
When he caught her,

17:52.050 --> 17:56.450
he slit her open and a couple of dozen
little baby sharks spilled out on the deck,

17:56.550 --> 17:58.710
all flipping around with
the yolk sacks still attached.

17:58.850 --> 17:59.850
Oh, yuck.

18:00.060 --> 18:01.830
- You're sick.
- Nice.

18:05.640 --> 18:06.840
Tell us about this.

18:08.270 --> 18:09.690
This one's great.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.800
One night, Big Ed, I mean Dad,

18:13.900 --> 18:16.560
and his buddies were all
over here having a drinking party,

18:16.660 --> 18:18.240
and they decided to have a contest.

18:18.740 --> 18:21.980
"Hey, let's throw
pyramid sinkers through the wall."

18:23.290 --> 18:24.980
You know, they almost made it.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.980
Well, Dad won the contest, naturally,

18:29.080 --> 18:30.580
and this was his winning toss.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.160
He was so proud, he nailed
a picture frame around it.

18:39.430 --> 18:41.970
Where are the bedrooms?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.640
Give us a break.

18:46.390 --> 18:47.680
Upstairs.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.190
Watch it, you're going to drop it.

19:14.460 --> 19:15.460
Don't tell us.

19:16.630 --> 19:19.890
Your dad won the Halloween costume
contest at the Moose Lodge.

19:20.140 --> 19:21.700
No, wait.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.130
That is a mask
of the Mayan rain god, Chaac.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.980
Dad picked it up
on a hunting trip in Yucatan.

19:27.140 --> 19:28.270
I think he stole it.

19:29.140 --> 19:32.640
You know, the priests were supposed
to wear these during ritual sacrifices.

19:33.150 --> 19:34.150
Sacrifices?

19:34.860 --> 19:36.900
Sacrifices.

19:38.360 --> 19:41.060
Tell me they sacrificed lambs
and little things like that?

19:41.160 --> 19:43.060
Yeah, little things like that.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.490
No, big things like girls.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.160
The victims, young virgins,

19:49.960 --> 19:51.710
were shot with arrows,

19:52.170 --> 19:54.190
or sometimes beheaded.

19:54.290 --> 19:56.030
Ugh, take this away from me.

19:57.510 --> 19:58.800
Virgins, huh?

19:59.170 --> 20:01.080
Well, at least we're all safe...

20:02.090 --> 20:03.170
Or are we?

20:04.470 --> 20:06.140
Jerk.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.560
What went there?

20:12.980 --> 20:16.090
Ah, one of my dad's favourite things.
His battle-axe.

20:16.190 --> 20:18.090
- It's not there now.
- No shit.

20:18.190 --> 20:19.590
It's missing.

20:19.690 --> 20:21.140
He probablyjust took it with him.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.220
How can you be sure? Maybe it was stolen.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.730
Sometimes he takes his toys
home for a while.

20:25.830 --> 20:28.400
- Well, I'm a little uncomfortable.
- Christ, who would want it.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.310
And why would they take
just the battle-axe?

20:30.410 --> 20:32.650
Yeah, why not that fantastic mask?

20:32.750 --> 20:34.880
Well, I don't know.

20:35.210 --> 20:38.210
But I'd feel a lot better
if you'd report it to the police.

20:41.050 --> 20:42.220
OK, I'll tell you what.

20:42.930 --> 20:46.100
We'll find a phone in the morning,
and I'll call my dad.

20:46.350 --> 20:48.030
If he says he doesn't have the battle-axe,

20:48.100 --> 20:50.460
then we'll call the
Sheriff's Department on the mainland

20:50.560 --> 20:54.110
and report that the house has been
broken into, and something stolen.

20:54.650 --> 20:55.650
OK?

20:56.230 --> 20:57.230
OK.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.840
OK, now let's get that stuff upstairs.

20:59.940 --> 21:02.230
All right. Sounds like a good idea to me.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.180
Oh...

21:28.260 --> 21:29.260
Uh...

21:29.600 --> 21:31.496
Hey, Ralph, want to help carry
some of these things up?

21:31.520 --> 21:33.170
They might get lost upstairs.

21:33.270 --> 21:34.690
It's still a little early.

21:38.270 --> 21:40.470
Hey, Pam, that's a great idea.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.280
Uh, need any help lighting your fire?

21:46.490 --> 21:47.530
Oh!

21:49.410 --> 21:51.480
Here's your room.
Why don't you give me those?

21:51.580 --> 21:54.120
No sooner said than done.

22:06.470 --> 22:08.370
It's a nice change, isn't it?

22:08.470 --> 22:09.760
Mmm-hmm.

22:20.770 --> 22:21.770
Yeah.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.200
Ah, it feels good.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.570
Come here.

23:33.390 --> 23:34.790
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.360
What do you suppose is in here?

24:04.460 --> 24:05.950
Trophies, of course, what else?

24:06.050 --> 24:08.550
Yeah, I wonder where he keeps them.

24:09.220 --> 24:12.410
Hey, maybe this is where
he keeps the mask of the sun god, Zeus.

24:12.510 --> 24:15.620
Yeah, maybe this is where he keeps
the mask of the moon god, goose!

24:15.720 --> 24:17.430
Oh! Whoa!

24:21.390 --> 24:23.890
Geez, that scared the shit out of me.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.680
What do you suppose these are for?

24:32.780 --> 24:34.200
To hold the net up.

24:34.370 --> 24:36.850
Wouldn't think they'd have
to be so sharp, would you?

24:36.950 --> 24:38.120
I don't know.

24:46.340 --> 24:48.380
How do I look as a fisherman?

24:49.590 --> 24:52.370
Not bad. But your rubbers are too big.

24:52.470 --> 24:54.850
That's the first time
you've ever said that.

24:55.350 --> 24:56.600
Here, catch.

24:58.140 --> 24:59.890
Think you could throw
that through the wall?

25:00.730 --> 25:04.730
Geez, I don't know, but I sure would hate
to get hit in the head with one of these.

25:06.310 --> 25:08.010
Or anywhere else.

25:12.490 --> 25:14.490
Hey, look at this a minute.

25:14.860 --> 25:18.110
You don't think this is what ran over
that sucker upstairs, do you?

25:18.490 --> 25:21.150
No, it's too small for a ski boat.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.500
Yeah, too small for a ski boat.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.380
Now, how about these?

25:28.500 --> 25:30.500
I know what these are for.

25:46.810 --> 25:47.810
Come here.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.390
Linda!

25:54.490 --> 25:56.510
- Yes?
- How about a little help up here?

25:56.610 --> 25:57.860
On the way.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.500
- Go on up, I'm right behind you.
- All right.

27:15.610 --> 27:16.970
That wasn't too bad.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.510
That was.

27:18.610 --> 27:20.270
- Say excuse me.
- Man...

27:20.370 --> 27:21.620
I've had about enough.

27:24.490 --> 27:25.636
Let's get this mess cleaned up.

27:25.660 --> 27:26.900
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.480
Here's a duty roster.

27:28.580 --> 27:29.860
A duty roster?

27:29.960 --> 27:31.690
Yep, Ed and I clean up tonight.

27:31.790 --> 27:33.440
Ralph and Sue tomorrow night, and so on.

27:34.630 --> 27:36.670
Come on, sweet meats,
let's go enjoy our night off.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.290
Come on, this is too much.

28:06.660 --> 28:08.620
Let's walk off some of that food.

28:09.540 --> 28:11.580
Come on, you guys,
let's go for a walk on the beach.

28:11.670 --> 28:13.670
Uh, you guys go ahead.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.570
We'll catch up to you later?

28:15.670 --> 28:16.670
Right.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.480
One, two, three, four, five, six.

29:18.730 --> 29:20.730
I wonder where Mike and Linda are.

29:25.910 --> 29:27.330
They're out on the beach.

29:27.530 --> 29:29.640
They've been gone a long time.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.750
Now, where did I put those arrows?

29:33.250 --> 29:34.750
Cut it out, Ralph.

29:35.790 --> 29:37.570
No sacrifices tonight.

29:37.670 --> 29:38.670
Eh!

29:39.920 --> 29:42.030
What are you so happy about, anyhow?

29:42.130 --> 29:44.660
You've done something.
I recognize that grin.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.620
Oh, you'll see.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.830
Done something cute to Mike and Linda.

29:48.930 --> 29:50.790
Quit that sort of thing, Ralph.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.810
Yeah, when are you gonna grow up?

29:53.680 --> 29:55.090
I don't know.

29:55.980 --> 29:57.940
Look, hey, let's take a break
from this game.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.800
It's so easy, it is boring.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.680
Easy? You're losing.

30:01.780 --> 30:03.360
Um, small point.

30:03.780 --> 30:05.160
I'm ready for a break.

30:05.780 --> 30:06.910
Suits me.

30:07.530 --> 30:09.510
I'm broke, anyhow.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.460
Let's catch up with Mike and Linda.

30:18.790 --> 30:20.700
Hey, guys!

30:22.670 --> 30:23.800
Mike!

30:25.680 --> 30:26.680
Linda!

30:57.040 --> 30:58.730
- Come on.
- Where?

30:58.830 --> 31:00.240
To the pool, dummy.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.130
Linda, where are you?

31:16.850 --> 31:18.340
What's wrong with the water?

31:18.440 --> 31:20.760
It looks like it's been
loaded down with chlorine.

31:20.860 --> 31:22.550
Will that hurt you?

31:22.650 --> 31:24.990
No, in fact it probably prevents herpes.

31:25.230 --> 31:28.730
Oh? I didn't know I had to be
concerned about that.

31:30.700 --> 31:31.850
You, in the pool.

31:31.950 --> 31:35.580
Hey, where did everybody go?

32:12.780 --> 32:13.950
This is great.

32:14.490 --> 32:15.580
Yeah.

32:16.910 --> 32:17.910
In the pool.

33:42.290 --> 33:43.750
That's sweet.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.200
Thank you.

33:48.710 --> 33:52.910
Does this mean that if we don't make love,
you'll still like me in the morning?

33:53.010 --> 33:56.340
It means, if we don't make love,
I'll still like you tonight.

33:57.050 --> 34:00.040
We'll just have to let the morning
see what the morning brings.

34:00.140 --> 34:03.020
Oh, heavy.

34:16.610 --> 34:18.929
Hey, where did everybody go?

34:19.030 --> 34:20.730
There's a slow echo in here.

34:23.250 --> 34:25.870
Stay here. I'll get it.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.050
Tag. You're it.

34:35.050 --> 34:36.550
Bet you can't find me.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.880
Mmm.

35:22.810 --> 35:24.520
Ah, this feels good.

35:26.180 --> 35:27.260
Mmm.

36:37.170 --> 36:38.170
Shit!

37:03.700 --> 37:06.830
Thank God for small favours.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.210
What's this?

37:20.420 --> 37:22.220
A little game, eh?

37:40.570 --> 37:42.240
Gotcha!

37:44.660 --> 37:46.240
Socks, nice.

37:47.240 --> 37:51.250
What I really want is my... jacket!

37:55.210 --> 37:57.960
Say, you're pretty good at this.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.640
Thanks.

38:33.870 --> 38:36.290
Now this is getting interesting.

38:39.880 --> 38:43.300
I think I'm getting your message.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.280
Geez, not again!

39:18.330 --> 39:20.960
I'm coming...

39:22.670 --> 39:24.550
To get you...

41:08.820 --> 41:11.320
- Do you see 'em?
- I thought I saw something.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.810
Mike!

41:12.910 --> 41:15.450
- Do you see them?
- Pam saw something.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.900
Is everything all right here?

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.360
You just scared me, that's all.

41:22.460 --> 41:25.030
What are you kids doing out here
at night on the beach, anyway?

41:25.130 --> 41:27.050
We're staying at my
father's condo, up that way.

41:27.590 --> 41:30.470
Right here along the street,
the one that runs on the ocean.

41:30.670 --> 41:33.780
Yeah, he was closing his condo
for the winter when he became ill,

41:33.880 --> 41:35.950
and we all came down to help finish up.

41:36.050 --> 41:38.050
It's the only one around
here with any lights on.

41:38.430 --> 41:40.560
I saw some men around there yesterday.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.710
But their car was gone.

41:42.810 --> 41:44.420
I didn't see anyone there today.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.380
Well, somebody was there today.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.480
When we came, the door was open
and one of his father's things was missing.

41:50.150 --> 41:51.440
Is that right?

41:52.400 --> 41:55.110
Yeah, but I'm sure my father
just took it home with him.

41:55.490 --> 41:58.430
Look, I'm gonna give him a call
in the morning and if it's not right,

41:58.530 --> 41:59.810
I'll report it.

41:59.910 --> 42:01.500
All right, I've noted it.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.570
And I'm not gonna make it
official until you call it in.

42:04.670 --> 42:05.670
OK.

42:05.750 --> 42:10.650
In the meantime, you kids be careful
out here on the beach tonight.

42:10.750 --> 42:12.330
It's not dangerous, is it?

42:12.510 --> 42:15.410
Yeah, there's no murderers
or rapers around, are there?

42:15.510 --> 42:18.510
I mean, have you been
having some heavy action lately?

42:19.810 --> 42:22.730
Are you kiddin'?
It's like a graveyard around here.

42:23.560 --> 42:26.350
There's some thunderstorms coming through.

42:27.440 --> 42:30.510
You could get struck by lightning
walking on the beach at night.

42:30.610 --> 42:32.440
OK, thanks for the warning.

42:33.490 --> 42:36.860
Say, you didn't happen to see another
couple walking on the beach, did you?

42:37.360 --> 42:38.390
No, I'm sorry.

42:38.490 --> 42:41.540
Well, if you do see them, don't look.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.620
OK, thanks.

42:52.300 --> 42:55.490
Say, how do you suppose
he could sneak up behind somebody

42:55.590 --> 42:57.450
wearing all of that hardware?

42:57.550 --> 42:58.550
Practice.

43:09.480 --> 43:11.650
Let me go! Let me go!

43:12.110 --> 43:13.360
Mike!

43:21.830 --> 43:25.120
Yeah, I'm investigating a possible 10-38

43:26.200 --> 43:28.980
at 4 East Ocean Townes.

43:29.080 --> 43:30.860
Roger, Ben.
We know where you are.

43:30.960 --> 43:31.960
10-4.

45:14.020 --> 45:15.190
Arghh!

45:43.800 --> 45:46.470
Well, anybody up for a footrace?

45:48.350 --> 45:49.930
Me too.

45:50.390 --> 45:51.630
Let's head back.

45:51.730 --> 45:54.210
Lightning is not one
of my favourite things.

45:54.310 --> 45:55.960
Yeah, that's a good idea.

45:56.060 --> 45:57.730
Oh, look. What's this?

46:03.150 --> 46:07.100
That's a skate's egg, sometimes
called the devil's pocketbook.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.520
Uh, they're said to attract lightning?

46:09.620 --> 46:10.870
- Right, Ralph.
- Mmm...

46:10.990 --> 46:12.240
No! No!

46:13.460 --> 46:15.690
You find many good seashells along here?

46:15.790 --> 46:19.570
Oh, yeah, at this time of year when
there's not too many people around,

46:19.670 --> 46:21.380
shell-hunting ought to be pretty good.

46:21.550 --> 46:23.380
Let's go look for seashells
in the morning.

46:23.550 --> 46:24.680
Sure.

46:26.760 --> 46:29.660
Let's hurry up and finish
the game. It's almost bedtime.

46:29.760 --> 46:31.460
You have a one-track mind.

46:31.560 --> 46:34.670
- I do not. I have a two-track mind.
- Oh, yeah, what's the other one on?

46:34.770 --> 46:37.380
Well, right now
it's on sex, too, but not always.

46:37.480 --> 46:38.510
I'll bet.

46:38.610 --> 46:40.510
Uh, you're not complaining, are you?

46:40.610 --> 46:41.610
Well, no.

46:41.690 --> 46:42.970
Right...

46:43.070 --> 46:46.470
I wish Ralph wouldn't have so
much to say about my being a virgin.

46:46.570 --> 46:48.680
Ah, he's trying to help me score.

46:48.780 --> 46:51.730
Score? Is that all
we are to you three? Scores?

46:51.830 --> 46:53.650
You know better than that.

46:53.750 --> 46:56.120
But to Ralph, it's a necessary
part of a relationship.

46:56.540 --> 46:58.690
Well, it's not a necessary
part of my relationships.

46:58.790 --> 46:59.820
I know.

46:59.920 --> 47:02.800
What's that supposed to mean?

47:17.600 --> 47:20.340
Well, Ralph, are you
ready to file for bankruptcy,

47:20.440 --> 47:23.000
or would you like to try to drag
it out just a little bit longer?

47:24.150 --> 47:26.720
Why don't you guys save
the rest of that game till tomorrow?

47:26.820 --> 47:28.720
Come on, let's do
something all of us can play.

47:28.820 --> 47:30.370
What'd you have in mind?

47:31.160 --> 47:32.660
Nothing in particular.

47:33.370 --> 47:34.730
Anybody got any ideas?

47:36.330 --> 47:37.846
It's getting close to bedtime, isn't it?

47:37.870 --> 47:40.440
Not yet, tiger.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.300
"Not yet, tiger."

47:54.350 --> 47:56.040
No more. I've had enough.

47:56.140 --> 47:58.310
Enough? You haven't had any... Ow!

48:01.230 --> 48:02.860
She'll do it, too, Ralph.

48:03.860 --> 48:06.760
Hey, I've got a great idea.
How about a game of Blind Man's Bluff?

48:06.860 --> 48:08.760
All right. I'll get the beers.

48:08.860 --> 48:10.450
No, I'll... I'll get 'em.

48:10.950 --> 48:11.950
Please?

48:26.550 --> 48:29.490
Pam was gonna give you a fat lip,
which you really did deserve.

48:29.590 --> 48:32.550
Nah,
she wasn't going to do anything.

48:32.680 --> 48:33.760
Bullshit.

48:37.060 --> 48:38.790
Blind Man's Bluff?

48:38.890 --> 48:41.840
I don't believe it. We're going
to grope around in the dark?

48:41.940 --> 48:43.760
Would you rather grope in the light?

48:43.860 --> 48:45.110
Get serious.

48:45.730 --> 48:48.470
First, everybody gets a beer.

48:48.570 --> 48:49.780
That's the important part.

48:50.450 --> 48:53.910
Then, we turn off all the lights.

48:54.620 --> 48:56.690
Whoever is "it" stays in the house,

48:56.790 --> 48:59.120
and the rest of us go outside
and drink a beer.

48:59.910 --> 49:02.770
Then, the person playing it hides himself,

49:02.870 --> 49:05.030
and we all come back in
and try to find him.

49:06.920 --> 49:08.570
When we do,

49:08.670 --> 49:12.590
we stand, or sit, or lie down next to him.

49:13.590 --> 49:14.590
Finally,

49:15.550 --> 49:19.830
there'll just be one person
wandering around the house,

49:19.930 --> 49:22.130
trying to find everybody else.

49:22.230 --> 49:23.550
Sounds like great fun.

49:23.650 --> 49:25.730
You'll see. You'll see.

49:29.940 --> 49:32.470
OK. Now, who's gonna be it?

49:32.570 --> 49:33.850
Me. I'm gonna be it.

49:33.950 --> 49:35.100
All right.

49:35.200 --> 49:37.870
Everybody else, out!

49:56.970 --> 49:58.260
Come on up.

50:04.140 --> 50:06.630
Let me down, let me down.

50:09.980 --> 50:11.640
Oh, the poor little thing.

50:39.260 --> 50:43.390
Sorry, Ralph, you'll have to go around
and play fair, just like everybody else.

51:00.410 --> 51:02.640
Here we come, ready or not.

51:04.410 --> 51:05.940
Think she's had enough time?

51:06.040 --> 51:07.040
Yeah.

55:22.050 --> 55:23.200
Any of you guys want a beer?

55:27.380 --> 55:29.370
Yeah, I'll take one.

55:29.470 --> 55:31.960
- Yeah, me too.
- Me too.

55:32.060 --> 55:33.370
How did you know we were here?

55:33.470 --> 55:36.210
Ha! It was the process of elimination.

55:36.310 --> 55:37.960
He'd already looked everywhere else.

55:38.060 --> 55:40.510
That's right.

55:44.730 --> 55:46.310
OK, what's next?

55:54.200 --> 55:55.450
I get it.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.870
You know, I'm really
worried about Mike and Linda.

56:07.970 --> 56:09.620
They've been gone so long.

56:09.720 --> 56:12.370
Hey, don't worry about Mike and Linda.

56:12.470 --> 56:15.540
They're just having a good time
enjoying each other's company.

56:15.640 --> 56:18.250
You know, it has been a pretty
long week for all of us

56:18.350 --> 56:21.440
and they're just relaxing. OK?

56:22.020 --> 56:24.360
- All right.
- All right. Come on.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.660
- Good night.
- Good night.

56:42.380 --> 56:43.380
Hi.

56:44.590 --> 56:47.910
You know, Ralph isn't
such a bad guy after all.

56:48.010 --> 56:49.320
I know. Told you so.

56:49.420 --> 56:51.960
I know. It's just that... Uh-uh.

56:53.390 --> 56:56.290
We have a deal, buddy,
and I'm holding you to it.

56:56.390 --> 56:57.580
Ah, come on...

56:57.680 --> 56:58.680
Now, look...

56:59.270 --> 57:03.300
You know how I feel about you,
and I want to.

57:03.400 --> 57:05.400
I really do, you know that.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.320
But I'm just not going to.

57:09.110 --> 57:11.320
Some other time, maybe,

57:12.410 --> 57:15.140
but not here, and not now.

57:17.410 --> 57:21.400
I was thinking that maybe the atmosphere
of this place would loosen you up a little.

57:21.500 --> 57:23.130
Shit.

57:29.420 --> 57:30.420
Ahh...

58:08.880 --> 58:10.860
Ralph, do you know what we forgot?

58:12.340 --> 58:14.990
Wait a minute, I think
I've got one in my pack.

58:15.090 --> 58:19.010
No, dummy,
we forgot to lock up for the night.

58:19.510 --> 58:21.710
Lock up?

58:21.810 --> 58:24.000
We're the only people on this island.

58:24.100 --> 58:25.310
Come on.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.130
Well, what about Mike and Linda?

58:27.230 --> 58:29.260
They're still outside, you know.

58:29.360 --> 58:31.490
Well, maybe you should
go and try to find them.

58:32.030 --> 58:33.700
At least make sure they're all right?

58:34.490 --> 58:38.220
And, uh, I've got something
to show you when you get back.

58:38.320 --> 58:41.240
Oh, Lord, goodness gracious.

58:48.790 --> 58:52.510
Oh, the kitchen door's already
locked, as if you didn't know.

58:56.090 --> 58:57.290
Yes?

58:57.390 --> 58:59.410
If you hear anyone
wandering around downstairs,

58:59.510 --> 59:02.310
don't shoot, it's just me.
Going down to lock up.

59:03.020 --> 59:05.496
Why are you gonna lock up?
There's no one on the island except us.

59:05.520 --> 59:07.310
Oh, well, you know.

59:07.690 --> 59:10.260
What about Mike and Linda?
How will they get in?

59:10.360 --> 59:14.220
Well, I'm going down to find them and
tell them the fort's closing for the night.

59:14.320 --> 59:17.360
If they want to come in, now is the time.

59:19.240 --> 59:20.430
Be careful.

59:20.530 --> 59:22.360
Well, I certainly will.

59:29.210 --> 59:31.150
"Do you know what we forgot to do, Ralph?

59:31.250 --> 59:32.670
"We forgot to lock up."

59:36.550 --> 59:39.790
Man, if that ain't bad enough,
then I have to open up my big mouth.

59:39.890 --> 59:41.600
"Yeah, what about Mike and Linda?"

59:44.310 --> 59:46.180
"What about Mike and Linda, Ralph?"

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:26.020
Mike!

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.690
Linda!

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.610
Now, where would I be?

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.600
Upstairs in bed.
That's where I'd be.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.100
Mike?

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.430
Linda?

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:19.190
Shit...

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:23.970
Why am I whispering?

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:26.980
There's absolutely no one
else on this island but us.

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:30.060
Hey, Mike, you and Linda come on out now.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.960
We need to lock up so we can go to bed.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.840
Look, come on out.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:41.280
Hey, I'm sorry for all those tricks
I've ever played on you, and I promise,

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.010
hey, I promise I'll never play
any more tricks.

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:15.780
Well, no wonder.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.070
Whoo-hoo!

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:18.710
Fallen asleep, huh?

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.130
All right!

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.330
Ta-da!

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.650
Not yet, huh?

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:58.840
Look, I gotta lock up,
cos I got something to see upstairs.

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:11.660
Oh, boy.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.970
Oh, guys, I'm really going
to hate to do this,

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.770
but I've got to make sure
you're OK for the night.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.700
No.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.660
Even I couldn't do that.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800
Ed...

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.220
Ed?

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:37.850
Did you hear something?

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.140
Ralph?

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.110
Ed. Ed.

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:02.000
Goddamn you, Ralph.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.220
Ed. Ed. Wake up.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.260
- What? What's the matter?
- Shh!

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.030
Listen. Something is wrong.

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.140
What, what is it?

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.940
All of the kids are missing.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:44.940
What?

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.420
Mike and Linda's bed has never been
slept in, and Sue and Ralph are gone.

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.360
- We're alone.
- They're just playing a game or something.

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.950
- Get up and help me look for the others.
- Leave me alone.

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:55.780
You've got to get up and help me!

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.260
All right. All right.

01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:01.350
Not sleeping together is one thing,

01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:05.350
not sleeping at all is something else.

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.900
See?

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.090
Ralph.

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.780
- Come on.
- Hmm.

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:19.899
See?

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.120
Ralph?

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:03.680
Whoa!

01:09:03.779 --> 01:09:05.216
Where have you been? Where are the others?

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.560
I don't know. I'm scared.
Something's wrong.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.479
Girls, just calm down.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.229
No, Mike and Linda have never come back.

01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:13.729
Ralph went to go look for them,
and now he's gone, too.

01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:14.899
Help me find him.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.316
- All right. All right.
- We'll find him.

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.700
Yeah, we'll look around down here.

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:19.620
- You go upstairs and get dressed.
- OK.

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:25.750
There aren't many places
to hide around here.

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:26.970
Yeah...

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.880
- Here, put this on.
- What for?

01:09:31.979 --> 01:09:33.420
- We're leaving.
- Oh...

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.439
- Hurry up, Sue.
- Coming.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.029
Hurry up, Sue!

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.520
We can't leave without Ralph.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.750
Oh, yes, we can. Come on.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.359
I'm not leaving without Ralph.

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.436
Just to drive over to the
Sheriff's Department on the mainland.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.690
- We'll be right back with help.
- I'm not leaving.

01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:00.990
- You've got to come.
- Let's take one last look around.

01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:03.050
- We'll be right back.
- One last look?

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:05.550
One last look?

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840
All right.

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:09.540
OK, you two go around
that side and I'll go this way.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.040
Uh-uh, buddy, I'm sticking with you.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.246
Why don't you two go around this side,
and I'll go around that side?

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:16.110
- Make it fast.
- OK.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.690
Ralph?

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.293
Sue?

01:12:04.893 --> 01:12:06.348
Sue?

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.800
Oh, God! Oh, God,
Ed, cover it up, cover it up!

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.650
OK, OK.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.080
Oh, God!

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.580
We've got to get out of here.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.220
- No, no! Let me out of here!
- Shh!

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.360
Let me out of here!

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.290
Just stop! Leave him alone!

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.920
No!

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:30.500
Stop!

01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:00.600
Pam! Get me out of this.

01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:03.770
Get me out of this!

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.340
Come on.

01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:23.060
Let's get out of here.

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:43.850
You're gonna have to drive.

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:45.490
OK. OK. Come on.

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:02.040
You think he's dead?

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:04.870
Hell, yes, he's dead. They're all dead.

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.290
I can't believe it.

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:08.930
Give me the keys.

01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:20.110
Pick it up.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:27.220
- How bad are you hurt?
- Pretty bad. I've got to get to a doctor.

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:28.480
I'm feeling funny.

01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.056
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Let's just get out of here.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.210
OK.

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:40.450
Aw, come on!

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:41.910
- Quit pumping the gas!
- Now what?

01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:43.470
Great, it's flooded!

01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:47.600
Just give it a few seconds.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.840
Don't you have a handkerchief
or something?

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:53.810
Yeah.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.650
- Here, let me have your belt.
- OK.

01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:17.670
Thanks.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.820
Why don't we turn off
the headlights? It'll save the battery.

01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:25.840
- Ed...
- Yeah?

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.410
Look!

01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:31.500
Ahh. Come on. Come on!

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.480
Oh, come on!

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:40.280
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.680
Pam, start the car!
For Christ's sake, start the car!

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:46.160
I'm trying!

01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:52.080
We're gonna die, we're gonna die.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.290
Oh, God! No!

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.550
Look out! Stop. Get your hands off him!

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:14.720
Come out, you son of a bitch! Come on!

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.720
I'll get it! I'll get it!

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.530
Look. Look!

01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:45.550
Help! Help!

01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:48.930
Look. Look. Look.

01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:56.770
Help!

01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:57.810
No!

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:04.280
No!

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.790
Jesus Christ.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.500
That's my dad...

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:30.960
Pull forward!

01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:50.450
Watch out!

01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:23.510
