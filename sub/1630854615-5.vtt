00:06.840 --> 00:08.466
<i>Arisu!</i>

00:14.931 --> 00:16.433
Arisu!

00:26.901 --> 00:29.738
Arisu!

01:35.470 --> 01:36.471
Aguni.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.725
Hey, newbie.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.105
You're alive.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.399
Not by choice.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.112
Saw Niragi out there.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.866
So he survived too, huh?

02:02.205 --> 02:03.706
And what about the others?

02:06.626 --> 02:08.545
We broke off from Ann and Chishiya.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.423
Kuina went to track them down.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.344
Tatta didn't make it out.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.684
And me, I'm… going to look for Usagi.

02:24.769 --> 02:25.812
I see.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.525
Where are you going?

02:31.484 --> 02:34.821
I'm taking down the King of Spades.
We could use a hand.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.906
How are you gonna do that?

02:37.866 --> 02:39.576
He's just a man, isn't he?

02:40.076 --> 02:41.828
All men have weaknesses.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.539
He's too strong.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.333
Yeah.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.711
So it's perfect for me.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.840
One last battlefield
for those of us looking to die.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.884
A last battlefield?

02:55.967 --> 02:58.219
I should've died in the fire at the Beach.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.389
I've got nowhere to go…

03:02.265 --> 03:03.433
and nowhere to be.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.939
Well, I don't have a death wish yet.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.948
Arisu, I have to ask.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.869
What are you living for, anyway?

03:23.828 --> 03:25.538
What's driving you, Arisu?

03:26.831 --> 03:29.417
Do you really wanna go back to our world?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.669
Or are you just running after a girl?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.214
Aguni.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.927
I don't need a reason to live.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.893
My purpose doesn't make a difference.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.480
Even if it's gone…

03:53.983 --> 03:55.652
Aguni, I need to keep living.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.407
That's a weak existence.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.869
Humans wanna live, don't they?

04:07.455 --> 04:08.456
I guess.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.251
I'm jealous, Arisu.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.989
-Wait a sec.
-Wow!

04:41.072 --> 04:43.366
-Your nails are so cute.
-Adorable!

04:43.449 --> 04:44.575
Where'd you get them done?

04:44.659 --> 04:47.912
-This place really close to the station.
-Yo, invite them!

04:47.996 --> 04:49.080
-No, you!
-Incoming.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.123
Hey, hey, hey.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.293
Barbecue on Sunday. Wanna come?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.336
-Barbecue!
-Barbecue?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.588
-You know it!
-Meat on the grill, ladies!

04:57.672 --> 05:00.133
We need memories
of our last high school summer.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.551
-Yeah!
-We can camp by the river.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.802
-I'm sorry.
-What do you say?

05:02.885 --> 05:05.930
That's the anniversary
of my mother's death.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.223
Oh. Brutal.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.767
We didn't know. Our bad.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.730
Yeah, that's because no one knows.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.940
Like I want people to hear that bitch died

05:16.024 --> 05:19.360
while on a trip with someone
she was cheating with.

05:19.444 --> 05:23.531
Anyway, who the hell would wanna grill
meat outside when it's this fucking hot?

05:23.614 --> 05:25.742
-Wow, that was harsh.
-Seriously?

05:25.825 --> 05:27.785
They just want us to grill their meat.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.997
You think you got a shot with us?
What are you, idiots?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.499
Aw, hey, I kinda feel bad.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.209
-Was that mean?
-You're terrible.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.753
Have fun with your meat!

05:39.297 --> 05:41.841
What? Don't you need
to go to archery club today?

05:41.924 --> 05:43.926
No, I don't feel like it.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.263
Oh, so apparently,
Meg broke up with her boyfriend.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.933
You're kidding. With Odaken?
They were, like, so in love.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.226
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.978
Not <i>so </i>much in love.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.272
-Huh?
-Huh?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.900
-Do you know something?
-What are you talking about?

05:59.609 --> 06:01.444
He said he was over it.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.821
And then he said he was into me!

06:05.490 --> 06:07.742
Wait, did you sleep with Odaken?

06:07.825 --> 06:10.161
-So what? He came on to me first.
-Please!

06:10.244 --> 06:12.580
-Insane.
-You knew what you were doing.

06:12.663 --> 06:17.126
God, you <i>really </i>won't let anything
stand between you and a guy.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.670
Right? She can't help herself!

06:19.754 --> 06:22.173
I can't compete with this--

06:24.384 --> 06:26.386
Huh?

06:56.999 --> 07:00.044
PLAYERS, PLEASE GATHER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD

07:00.128 --> 07:04.549
ONE PER PERSON

07:37.206 --> 07:40.168
PLEASE WAIT FOR THE GAME TO BEGIN
CURRENT TOTAL: 17 PARTICIPANTS

07:40.251 --> 07:41.919
Game? What is this?

07:44.797 --> 07:46.174
What's happening?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.093
Where did everyone go?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.473
You wanna survive, girl?

07:54.974 --> 07:57.185
Then you're gonna have to beat the game.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.775
<i>Difficulty, Seven of Spades.</i>

08:05.860 --> 08:08.112
<i>Game, Boiling Death.</i>

08:08.863 --> 08:10.656
<i>Rules. Escape.</i>

08:11.449 --> 08:15.161
<i>The game ends</i>
<i>when the arena fully collapses.</i>

08:21.083 --> 08:22.543
Fully collapses?

08:33.930 --> 08:35.848
What's… What's going on?

08:38.226 --> 08:39.810
Oh! What…

08:41.354 --> 08:45.191
This can't be happening.
I can't… I'm out of here!

08:45.274 --> 08:47.151
I don't wanna play!

08:56.869 --> 08:58.329
Come on, run!

10:15.281 --> 10:18.367
It's hot! It's hot!

10:29.629 --> 10:31.213
I gotta pull it out.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.380
You can do it!

12:13.649 --> 12:17.611
I know that I wasn't the best person
before. I know!

12:17.695 --> 12:23.117
Someone sent me to this nightmare
because I wasn't good?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.747
I don't deserve
to die like this!

12:29.874 --> 12:32.460
It's all that bitch's fault…

12:59.653 --> 13:01.489
This isn't who you are.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.165
Takeru.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.724
Why are you here?

13:30.559 --> 13:32.853
You think working with them will help you?

13:37.441 --> 13:39.693
You even bothered to save Arisu.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.113
Maybe you've got death on your mind?

13:44.406 --> 13:47.243
You're trying to make up for all those
people you killed

13:47.326 --> 13:48.953
back at the Beach, aren't you?

13:51.163 --> 13:55.543
The King of Spades isn't like you or me.
He's a mighty warrior.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.505
You don't deserve to die like a hero.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.390
You wanna die so damn bad?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.186
You should put a bullet
through your skull.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.582
Aguni.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.251
We have to stop this.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.963
No more innocent people have to die.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.382
Too many have already.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.012
All right, I get it.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.764
Please just go now.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.558
Are you awake?

15:42.483 --> 15:43.984
Hey, are you a virgin or what?

15:44.568 --> 15:45.486
No!

15:59.083 --> 16:00.250
All right…

16:01.335 --> 16:03.504
Um, which way to the city?

16:04.004 --> 16:06.423
Huh? You're leaving already?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.342
I'm looking for someone.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.054
Like a girl someone, right?

16:13.013 --> 16:13.847
Usagi?

16:14.640 --> 16:15.933
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.311
Hmm!

16:25.025 --> 16:26.735
Do you think I'm cuter than her?

16:27.403 --> 16:28.487
What?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.075
That sounds like a yes.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.245
-No.
-Are you blushing?

16:36.328 --> 16:37.413
No, I'm not.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.674
You seem nice enough.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.094
-Huh?
-And you're pretty cute too…

16:52.177 --> 16:54.138
-All right, let's do it.
-Whoa, hang on! Hey!

16:55.305 --> 16:58.892
We have to live in a world where we don't
know if we'll survive the day, you know?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.478
-And besides, it's been so long…
-Get off me !

17:01.562 --> 17:02.479
-Gah!
-Come on!

17:07.484 --> 17:08.944
Uh…

17:09.028 --> 17:11.613
This… This isn't what it looks like.
It's nothing!

17:11.697 --> 17:13.907
Don't look at me like that! You…

17:13.991 --> 17:16.076
You already said no, so…

17:16.744 --> 17:18.537
We're on the move. Get up.

17:19.204 --> 17:23.083
What? I'm not going with you.
I'm going to look for Usagi.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.586
You should be worried
about yourself right now.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.382
As soon as he gets us in his sights,
he's gonna attack.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.843
He might even be tracking us here already.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.178
I don't know.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.847
But we definitely have to keep moving.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.184
We'll lead him up
into the mountains somewhere.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.518
Then we'll strike.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.731
More people means more chances. Here.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.902
Hey, wait!

17:51.904 --> 17:54.239
Oh my God. He's so cool.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.705
The King of Spades
is always on the move,

18:01.789 --> 18:03.791
looking for more players to kill.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.795
But it's not random, right?
It feels targeted.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.838
I bet he's keeping tabs on us.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.841
We'll find a good spot to ambush him.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.266
The King of Spades is never going to stop.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.977
He's already killed so many.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.524
I figured we'd be safe
if we stayed out here in the woods,

18:29.817 --> 18:31.318
but that didn't stop him.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.992
The compass is saying
we should be near Kichijoji Station.

18:39.952 --> 18:40.994
You sure?

19:11.900 --> 19:14.528
Killed himself
before his visa could run out.

19:15.529 --> 19:19.324
That son of a bitch didn't even fight.
He just took the coward's way out.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.619
In a world like this,
can you really blame him?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.583
All I know is I'll never make that choice.

19:29.751 --> 19:32.212
You ever lose someone you were close to
in a game?

19:35.048 --> 19:36.216
No, I haven't.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.761
What I lost…

19:41.972 --> 19:44.391
was an important piece of who I was.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.655
<i>Akane.</i>

20:45.535 --> 20:47.537
Mom?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.960
What the hell are you doing here?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.430
<i>Akane!</i>

21:17.484 --> 21:18.735
<i>Come to me.</i>

21:28.578 --> 21:30.580
Can I trust you, Mom? Huh?

22:02.654 --> 22:03.905
It's not hot.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.083
<i>I was the only survivor</i>
<i>of my first game.</i>

22:18.086 --> 22:22.007
<i>My mom, that cheating bitch,</i>
<i>her ghost saved my life.</i>

22:47.157 --> 22:48.700
The color's getting weird.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.121
I'm gonna die.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.664
It's gonna kill me.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.544
That is some advanced gangrene.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.430
That leg has to go.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.265
At least, if you wanna survive.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.143
You a doctor?

23:16.853 --> 23:17.979
Can you help me, then?

23:18.772 --> 23:20.440
What, help you for free?

23:20.524 --> 23:23.151
Do you want money? How can I pay?

23:23.944 --> 23:26.446
Hah! Adorable.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.908
Like I have any use for money here.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.035
Come on.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.844
Okay, then…

23:53.723 --> 23:55.642
Just do something for my leg!

24:02.441 --> 24:04.109
Aah!

24:16.538 --> 24:19.207
I owe a debt
to the me who survived that day.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.544
I'm here because of what she did.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.505
So I'll survive, no matter what the cost.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.551
I'm never gonna take the easy way out.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.888
I have to keep living.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.277
We already looked. There's nothing.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.791
If you want, help yourself.

26:33.717 --> 26:34.801
Thank you.

26:37.887 --> 26:38.888
He's yours?

26:42.642 --> 26:45.562
I found him all alone
while I was playing tag.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.232
And your parents?

26:57.699 --> 26:59.242
I think they might be dead.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.787
He doesn't have much time
left on his visa.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.789
I couldn't leave him alone.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.584
In that case,

27:08.877 --> 27:10.879
even if he makes it back to our world,

27:12.380 --> 27:13.590
it'll be hard.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.678
His life won't be easy.

27:21.723 --> 27:22.557
But

27:23.516 --> 27:29.272
I have to believe that his parents want
their son to live and make it back safe.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.194
They must want him
to find happiness there.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.946
I know it.

28:00.637 --> 28:01.680
Yuzuha.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.723
Yeah?

28:03.807 --> 28:06.226
If something happens and I disappear,

28:07.352 --> 28:09.521
promise you won't be sad.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.148
What are you saying?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.858
It's what I want.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.403
It's my dream to die in the mountains.

28:17.153 --> 28:18.655
Don't say that.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.242
I don't wanna die like…

28:22.325 --> 28:25.578
…an old man in the hospital.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.502
Ah, if the mountains kill me,

28:33.169 --> 28:35.714
then that's just proof I lived well.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.300
And so if that happened,

28:39.384 --> 28:42.512
I want you to live
as full a life as possible.

28:42.595 --> 28:43.847
To go on.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.035
We must be around Yokohama right now.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.473
Is this forest ever going to end?

31:02.443 --> 31:04.445
We'll lure him here.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.573
Here?

31:07.657 --> 31:08.741
This is a cliff.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.119
Nobody asked you.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.588
A smoke bomb?

31:21.671 --> 31:23.882
The traps warn us of incoming attacks.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.718
We'll be alerted by them, even at night.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.679
It's too bad we don't have any grenades.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.181
Set up all the wires we have.

31:33.641 --> 31:34.809
Why just use wire?

31:35.602 --> 31:38.104
A trap doesn't have to be real
to be effective.

31:38.187 --> 31:41.149
As long as it makes the enemy go
where you want them to go.

31:42.817 --> 31:43.902
You know a lot.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.404
-Sure do.
-I taught her.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.532
You keep watch at the tent.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.646
Was I bait for you?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.273
You have a talent for it.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.944
He invincible?

34:32.028 --> 34:33.654
It's a bulletproof vest.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.907
My guess is he's a mercenary.

34:35.990 --> 34:38.659
We'll cover each other
while we lead him to the cliff.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.329
Go.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.875
Arisu! Run!

35:35.216 --> 35:36.384
Arisu!

36:18.217 --> 36:19.260
Aguni!

38:39.525 --> 38:40.609
Usagi!

38:48.868 --> 38:49.994
Ah!

38:55.124 --> 38:56.375
I'm sorry.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.403
-That's it!
-Yeah! We did it!

40:06.654 --> 40:08.447
All right!

40:08.531 --> 40:10.825
-All right! We did it!
-Yeah!

40:10.908 --> 40:13.619
Yeah! Yeah!

40:15.121 --> 40:15.955
We won this!

40:16.038 --> 40:17.206
Run!

40:17.915 --> 40:19.542
-We got this!
-I'm done!

40:19.708 --> 40:21.252
-I can't do it.
-Keep going!

40:21.335 --> 40:22.878
Usagi!

40:27.299 --> 40:28.717
Usagi!

40:28.801 --> 40:30.553
-Keep moving.
-Yeah!

40:49.196 --> 40:50.906
No blaze of glory for me…

41:04.420 --> 41:05.463
Go.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.596
Get outta here!

41:17.266 --> 41:18.517
Aguni?

41:35.367 --> 41:37.536
You're all right!

42:54.613 --> 42:56.949
<i>Difficulty, Jack of Spades.</i>

43:38.741 --> 43:41.410
I gotta hand it
to these face card games.

43:41.493 --> 43:43.287
They're not messing around.

43:45.247 --> 43:47.166
Ow, that's not good.

44:15.944 --> 44:17.780
They won't beat me.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.844
This isn't the world I know.

45:55.085 --> 45:56.170
I'm not going.

46:00.257 --> 46:01.675
Do you want to die?

46:05.679 --> 46:06.680
No?

46:07.347 --> 46:09.099
Then let's win it together.

46:10.726 --> 46:12.770
But what's going to happen to us?

46:18.400 --> 46:19.443
If we win…

46:21.278 --> 46:22.946
we get to go back home.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.243
They're not there anymore.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.997
Mom and Dad are both gone.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.086
I get it.

46:39.546 --> 46:42.966
What is it that you think your parents
would want you to do, Kota?

46:46.845 --> 46:48.639
They'd want me to come home.

46:50.974 --> 46:52.100
Then let's go.

47:42.484 --> 47:43.986
And how old are you, kid?

47:44.945 --> 47:45.904
I'm ten.

47:48.073 --> 47:49.241
You're a good kid.

47:54.288 --> 47:57.124
This is a Spade game,
and you can't have a kid here.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.502
If he weighs us down,
I'll do what I have to.

48:02.129 --> 48:03.255
So don't blame me.

48:07.968 --> 48:10.846
Usagi has what it takes to win.

48:17.311 --> 48:19.229
Arisu.

48:19.938 --> 48:21.023
Usagi.

48:28.488 --> 48:30.324
I knew you'd still be alive.

48:31.909 --> 48:32.910
Me too.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.413
But how did you know I'd be here?

48:37.664 --> 48:39.625
I knew you'd try a physical game.

48:40.417 --> 48:43.879
All that's left is the Queen of Spades
and the King.

49:16.870 --> 49:17.955
And this is Kota.

49:18.664 --> 49:20.374
His visa runs out today.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.584
So you brought him here?

49:23.710 --> 49:27.130
I figured that
I could help him in a Spade game.

49:31.176 --> 49:32.928
What's going on?

49:35.555 --> 49:37.391
<i>Game, Checkmate.</i>

49:38.100 --> 49:39.309
Checkmate?

49:41.019 --> 49:45.941
<i>Today, the Queen Team will face off</i>
<i>against you, the Challenger Team.</i>

49:48.151 --> 49:49.820
<i>Welcome, Challenger Team.</i>

49:49.903 --> 49:53.073
<i>Welcome to the arena</i>
<i>of beautiful bodies in motion.</i>

49:53.991 --> 49:56.535
<i>I am the Queen of Spades.</i>

49:57.619 --> 50:01.289
<i>The Queen Team is made up of four members,</i>
<i>including myself.</i>

50:01.373 --> 50:04.292
<i>Your Challenger Team has 16 members.</i>

50:04.376 --> 50:06.420
Do you think they're citizens as well?

50:07.462 --> 50:09.047
<i>Each team will have a King.</i>

50:09.131 --> 50:10.757
<i>Don't worry, I'll choose.</i>

50:11.591 --> 50:13.260
<i>The Queen Team's King</i>

50:14.386 --> 50:15.429
<i>is me.</i>

50:16.596 --> 50:19.850
<i>Now, I'm looking</i>
<i>for a good Challenger King.</i>

50:21.059 --> 50:22.394
<i>Who's it gonna be?</i>

50:25.439 --> 50:26.440
<i>Oh.</i>

50:28.275 --> 50:29.568
<i>I choose him.</i>

50:49.129 --> 50:50.547
<i>Game rules.</i>

50:52.340 --> 50:56.970
<i>The teams will alternate taking turns</i>
<i>for a total of 16 rounds.</i>

50:57.054 --> 50:58.972
<i>During the Queen Team's turn,</i>

50:59.056 --> 51:03.894
<i>the Queen Team's players</i>
<i>will chase the Challenger Team's players.</i>

51:03.977 --> 51:07.189
<i>If the button on a player's back</i>
<i>is pressed,</i>

51:07.272 --> 51:10.067
<i>the button's light</i>
<i>will turn from blue to red,</i>

51:10.150 --> 51:11.735
<i>the Queen Team's color.</i>

51:12.694 --> 51:17.324
<i>That player may not move</i>
<i>for the remainder of that round.</i>

51:17.407 --> 51:19.034
<i>Starting on the following round,</i>

51:19.117 --> 51:23.121
<i>that player will now be considered</i>
<i>a member of the Queen Team.</i>

51:23.955 --> 51:28.001
<i>The King, however,</i>
<i>is not allowed to change teams.</i>

51:29.795 --> 51:33.965
<i>The opposite will occur</i>
<i>during the Challenger Team's turns.</i>

51:34.049 --> 51:37.469
<i>Each turn will last no more</i>
<i>than five minutes.</i>

51:37.552 --> 51:41.556
<i>After the end of 16 rounds</i>
<i>of alternating turns,</i>

51:41.640 --> 51:44.559
<i>the team with the most members wins.</i>

51:45.268 --> 51:48.188
<i>The members of the losing team,</i>
<i>including the King,</i>

51:48.271 --> 51:50.023
<i>will all die.</i>

51:50.816 --> 51:52.317
What the hell is this?

51:53.693 --> 51:54.736
It seems like

51:55.612 --> 51:57.405
chess, or shogi, more like.

51:57.989 --> 52:01.743
If you get tagged when they push your
button, you're captured by the enemy team.

52:02.744 --> 52:05.831
You switch sides, you fight for them now.

52:05.914 --> 52:07.582
That's how it works.

52:09.543 --> 52:13.171
<i>Please equip your vests,</i>
<i>with the buttons facing the back.</i>

52:24.349 --> 52:26.810
-I'm sure it'll be fine.
-How do you do this?

52:28.353 --> 52:30.021
Can I see yours?

52:34.776 --> 52:38.155
<i>Round one.</i>
<i>Queen Team's turn begins.</i>

52:38.780 --> 52:41.032
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

52:41.616 --> 52:43.410
<i>Game start.</i>

52:44.911 --> 52:46.913
Huh?

52:51.835 --> 52:53.962
They're coming.
They're coming. They're coming!

52:55.463 --> 52:56.882
They're coming for us!

52:57.841 --> 52:59.926
They'll get us all if we stay together!
Let's split up!

53:00.010 --> 53:01.052
-Yeah!
-Okay? Let's go!

53:01.136 --> 53:02.179
-Come on!
-Move!

53:02.262 --> 53:03.930
-We can't stay together!
-Hurry!

53:04.014 --> 53:04.848
-Hide!
-This way!

53:04.931 --> 53:05.891
-Go!
-Go, go!

53:11.646 --> 53:12.647
We'll keep you safe.

53:13.231 --> 53:14.858
Just stay right here, okay?

53:16.443 --> 53:18.236
-Okay.
-Usagi, come on.

53:30.498 --> 53:32.792
Go, go! Hurry! Go, go!

53:34.002 --> 53:35.003
Go!

53:35.086 --> 53:37.297
-No, they're here!
-Go back, go back! Run!

53:37.881 --> 53:39.257
Left! This way!

53:41.134 --> 53:43.720
-Keep running! They're here!
-Run, run, run!

53:43.803 --> 53:45.555
No, out of the way! Out of the way!

53:57.442 --> 53:59.152
Oh no!

54:12.540 --> 54:16.086
Pushing the button gives you
a little shock. I should have said.

54:16.169 --> 54:19.339
But don't worry,
you're gonna be my pawn next turn.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.055
-Where?
-They went that way.

54:27.722 --> 54:30.058
Up! There's one up!

54:31.142 --> 54:32.185
Run!

55:05.010 --> 55:08.763
<i>The first turn</i>
<i>is ending in ten seconds.</i>

55:08.847 --> 55:11.891
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

55:11.975 --> 55:14.144
<i>-seven, six…</i>
-This is bad.

55:14.227 --> 55:15.687
<i>-…five…</i>
-Look at all the red.

55:15.770 --> 55:17.731
<i>-…four, three…</i>
But at least her turn is up.

55:17.814 --> 55:19.065
<i>…two, one.</i>

55:20.942 --> 55:22.485
<i>Starting the Challengers' turn.</i>

55:24.863 --> 55:27.282
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

55:27.782 --> 55:28.783
<i>Turn start.</i>

55:28.867 --> 55:31.286
Let's get back the ones we lost.

55:31.369 --> 55:34.622
Besides, it's not like the new pawns
are gonna wanna work for her.

55:34.706 --> 55:36.124
They'll wanna rejoin us, right?

55:36.207 --> 55:38.585
-Right.
-Yeah. Okay. Let's go!

55:42.756 --> 55:44.799
Hey! Hey! Over here!

55:44.883 --> 55:45.967
Up here! Up here!

55:46.051 --> 55:48.928
Hey! Come on! Get up here. Help! Help!

55:49.012 --> 55:50.138
You gotta tag me back!

55:50.722 --> 55:52.015
-Okay, hang on!
-Hurry!

55:52.515 --> 55:54.726
-Don't move!
-Hurry up! Hurry!

56:01.858 --> 56:02.734
Up here!

56:03.568 --> 56:05.403
Huh? Whoa!

56:06.071 --> 56:07.072
Here, thanks!

56:20.335 --> 56:21.920
What's she doing to him?

56:22.003 --> 56:23.880
She's stopping him from tagging.

56:23.963 --> 56:27.258
Of course. The rules
didn't mention anything about that.

56:28.134 --> 56:30.470
<i>Round three.</i>

56:30.553 --> 56:33.098
<i>Queen Team's turn begins.</i>

56:33.807 --> 56:36.267
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

56:36.351 --> 56:38.144
<i>Turn start.</i>

56:38.228 --> 56:39.896
We're gonna have to split up.

56:39.979 --> 56:41.940
Get each player back one by one.

56:42.023 --> 56:44.651
If we split up,
maybe we won't find each other again.

56:44.734 --> 56:46.027
I'm not losing you.

56:51.991 --> 56:54.411
After each turn,
there's a siren that goes off.

56:54.494 --> 56:55.495
Yeah…

56:58.957 --> 57:02.544
When it does, come to this side.
We'll be able to check on each other.

57:03.211 --> 57:04.421
Right. Got it.

57:29.529 --> 57:30.947
No! Please!

57:31.030 --> 57:33.283
Stay back! Stop!

57:42.625 --> 57:44.252
You wanna live or not?

57:45.962 --> 57:46.796
I wanna live.

57:47.547 --> 57:50.008
Then you're gonna have to play on my team.

57:51.468 --> 57:54.053
<i>Turn five.</i>
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

58:03.688 --> 58:04.898
No, stop!

58:07.942 --> 58:10.361
You-- you get back here! Stop running!

58:10.445 --> 58:11.529
Damn it!

58:14.574 --> 58:15.492
That's it…

58:51.694 --> 58:53.321
Ah! Got you! Yes!

58:58.451 --> 59:02.956
<i>Round ten.</i>
<i>Challenger Team's turn begins.</i>

59:03.039 --> 59:05.375
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

59:05.458 --> 59:07.252
<i>Turn start.</i>

59:07.835 --> 59:09.003
Let me help you!

59:12.840 --> 59:15.718
Wait! Wait. Hang on!

59:30.400 --> 59:32.694
<i>Round 11.</i>

59:32.777 --> 59:35.238
<i>Queen Team's turn begins.</i>

59:35.738 --> 59:37.907
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

59:37.991 --> 59:39.909
<i>Turn start.</i>

59:39.993 --> 59:41.661
-You okay?
Okay!

59:45.540 --> 59:47.959
-Go, run!
Hurry up! It'll be the next turn soon!

59:48.042 --> 59:50.461
-Got you! Hah! Loser!
-Oh, no!

1:00:13.526 --> 1:00:15.278
Join us on the Queen's Team.

1:00:16.321 --> 1:00:18.072
What? What do you mean?

1:00:19.616 --> 1:00:23.328
If you stay in this arena,
you don't have to play the other games.

1:00:23.411 --> 1:00:26.748
King of Spades can't kill you either,
if you're in here.

1:00:27.457 --> 1:00:28.625
That's not bad, huh?

1:00:30.043 --> 1:00:31.753
Wait, you're players too?

1:00:31.836 --> 1:00:34.213
-Just players like us?
-Sure we are.

1:00:34.839 --> 1:00:37.675
We played this game last time
and won by sticking with the Queen.

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:41.471
She's strong, man. She never loses.

1:00:41.554 --> 1:00:43.890
Plus if we win, we get to stay right here.

1:00:44.724 --> 1:00:48.603
So if the Queen never loses,
then her team gets to keep playing.

1:00:48.686 --> 1:00:49.562
You get it?

1:00:50.521 --> 1:00:54.275
The Queen's team gets to survive
in this place as long as they want.

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:58.237
Pretty cool, wouldn't you say, man?

1:01:17.423 --> 1:01:19.801
-Found anyone else?
-No, not yet.

1:01:19.884 --> 1:01:21.386
Let's look upstairs.

1:01:21.928 --> 1:01:23.429
Oh, shit.

1:01:30.436 --> 1:01:31.813
It's not so bad, right?

1:01:32.438 --> 1:01:34.941
At least we don't have to die
in some other game.

1:01:36.067 --> 1:01:37.151
Yeah.

1:01:38.069 --> 1:01:41.406
Yeah, boys!
It's easy if we all work together now!

1:01:41.489 --> 1:01:43.991
Protect the Queen
and protect your own lives, all right?

1:01:44.992 --> 1:01:46.077
Yeah.

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:53.501
I feel bad for the kid.

1:01:54.085 --> 1:01:55.420
But it's him or us, right?

1:01:56.629 --> 1:02:00.049
Exactly. There's nothing
we can do about it now.

1:02:01.926 --> 1:02:04.053
There's only three of them left.

1:02:06.222 --> 1:02:07.932
Victory is in sight.

1:02:08.808 --> 1:02:11.144
And best of all, none of you have to die.

1:02:13.396 --> 1:02:15.398
-Oh!
-But listen.

1:02:16.399 --> 1:02:18.860
I wanna get one more of them.

1:02:18.943 --> 1:02:20.236
One more? Which one?

1:02:20.903 --> 1:02:23.114
The guy who knew the girl and the kid.

1:02:24.198 --> 1:02:26.784
Oh yeah. Arisu or something.

1:02:28.453 --> 1:02:29.829
Yeah, exactly.

1:02:35.334 --> 1:02:36.502
I want him.

1:02:39.756 --> 1:02:44.218
<i>Two more people</i>
<i>until checkmate. Turn 13.</i>

1:02:44.302 --> 1:02:46.554
<i>Starting Queen's turn.</i>

1:02:46.637 --> 1:02:49.015
<i>The turn will last five minutes.</i>

1:02:49.098 --> 1:02:50.933
<i>Turn, start.</i>

1:02:54.562 --> 1:02:55.855
There he is!

1:03:16.876 --> 1:03:17.752
Go, run!

1:03:17.835 --> 1:03:19.045
She's after you.

1:03:19.962 --> 1:03:20.838
What?
