03:19.349 --> 03:20.599
Hello.

03:21.559 --> 03:24.228
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.819
Do you want a chocolate?

03:34.405 --> 03:37.825
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

03:38.993 --> 03:44.206
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

03:46.209 --> 03:49.086
You never know what you're gonna get.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.846
Those must be comfortable shoes.

04:00.223 --> 04:04.893
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

04:07.105 --> 04:09.565
I wish I had shoes like that.

04:10.232 --> 04:11.774
My feet hurt.

04:12.985 --> 04:14.652
Mama always said there's an awful lot

04:14.736 --> 04:17.947
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

04:19.074 --> 04:22.034
Where they're going,
where they've been.

04:29.293 --> 04:31.335
I've worn lots of shoes.

04:34.464 --> 04:39.260
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.807
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

04:45.601 --> 04:48.227
She said they was my magic shoes.

04:48.312 --> 04:51.480
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

04:58.780 --> 05:01.240
Let's take a little walk around.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.832
How do those feel?

05:12.794 --> 05:14.962
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

05:15.047 --> 05:17.548
as strong as I've ever seen,

05:17.633 --> 05:21.010
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

05:22.304 --> 05:25.389
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

05:25.474 --> 05:26.599
Forrest!

05:28.101 --> 05:29.310
Now, when I was a baby,

05:29.394 --> 05:32.230
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,

05:32.314 --> 05:34.732
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

05:34.816 --> 05:37.026
She said we was related to him
in some way.

05:37.110 --> 05:38.486
And what he did was,

05:38.570 --> 05:42.823
he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.

05:42.908 --> 05:46.244
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets

05:46.328 --> 05:50.665
and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.

05:50.749 --> 05:54.627
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

05:54.711 --> 05:57.755
And anyway, that's how I got my name,

05:57.839 --> 05:59.257
Forrest Gump.

05:59.341 --> 06:01.092
Mama said that the "Forrest" part

06:01.176 --> 06:04.720
was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,

06:04.805 --> 06:07.598
well, just don't make no sense.

06:13.272 --> 06:16.774
Okay... Get it, get it...

06:16.858 --> 06:19.819
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

06:20.737 --> 06:22.238
All right...

06:22.823 --> 06:24.490
What are you all staring at?

06:24.574 --> 06:29.036
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

06:30.580 --> 06:34.292
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

06:34.376 --> 06:36.961
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

06:37.045 --> 06:39.170
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

06:39.255 --> 06:40.964
Mama always had a way of
explaining things

06:41.048 --> 06:43.049
so I could understand them.

06:44.510 --> 06:48.013
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

06:48.097 --> 06:51.141
about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

06:51.225 --> 06:53.977
That's in the county of Greenbow.

06:54.061 --> 06:58.481
Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

06:58.566 --> 07:00.483
had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,

07:00.568 --> 07:02.485
something like that.

07:02.570 --> 07:05.280
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

07:05.364 --> 07:08.116
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

07:08.200 --> 07:10.160
mostly to people passing through,

07:10.244 --> 07:14.205
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

07:14.290 --> 07:17.000
That's how me and Mama got money.

07:17.084 --> 07:19.836
Mama was a real smart lady.

07:19.920 --> 07:24.924
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

07:27.428 --> 07:29.804
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

07:29.889 --> 07:34.059
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

07:34.560 --> 07:39.022
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

07:39.106 --> 07:41.316
Now, his IQ is 75.

07:42.109 --> 07:45.236
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

07:48.824 --> 07:50.867
She wanted me to have
the finest education,

07:50.951 --> 07:54.871
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

07:54.955 --> 07:57.207
I met the principal and all.

07:57.708 --> 08:00.585
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.922
Now, this is normal.

08:04.423 --> 08:07.717
Forrest is right here.

08:08.552 --> 08:14.099
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.477
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

08:17.561 --> 08:19.687
Now, he'll be just fine.

08:20.481 --> 08:22.565
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

08:22.650 --> 08:26.027
He might be a bit on the slow side,

08:27.154 --> 08:28.905
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

08:28.989 --> 08:31.533
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

08:31.617 --> 08:35.412
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

08:35.496 --> 08:38.664
We're talking about
five little points here.

08:40.376 --> 08:43.001
There must be something can be done.

08:44.588 --> 08:47.048
We're a progressive school system.

08:47.883 --> 08:50.802
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

08:51.679 --> 08:55.140
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

08:58.394 --> 09:00.270
He's on vacation.

09:17.745 --> 09:21.540
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

09:27.046 --> 09:29.506
You don't say much, do you?

09:41.019 --> 09:42.978
"Finally, he had to try.

09:43.062 --> 09:45.022
"It looked easy, but,

09:46.232 --> 09:48.567
"oh, what happened.

09:48.651 --> 09:51.653
- "First, there... "
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

09:52.197 --> 09:54.781
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

09:57.410 --> 10:00.120
Vacation's when you go somewhere

10:02.499 --> 10:04.833
and you don't ever come back.

10:09.172 --> 10:12.966
Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.

10:14.177 --> 10:17.804
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

10:17.889 --> 10:20.474
There was always folks
coming and going.

10:20.558 --> 10:21.642
Supper.

10:21.726 --> 10:25.145
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

10:25.230 --> 10:27.773
Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us

10:27.857 --> 10:30.526
that every room
was filled with travelers.

10:30.610 --> 10:34.238
You know, folks living out
of their suitcases

10:34.322 --> 10:37.282
and hat cases and sample cases.

10:37.367 --> 10:40.786
Forrest Gump, it's supper time! Forrest...

10:40.870 --> 10:43.413
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

10:43.498 --> 10:47.125
and he had him a guitar case.

11:01.099 --> 11:05.102
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.520
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

11:06.604 --> 11:09.439
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

11:09.524 --> 11:12.484
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

11:12.569 --> 11:15.529
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

11:16.197 --> 11:19.783
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.743
Slow it down some.

11:23.871 --> 11:25.789
I liked that guitar.

11:26.457 --> 11:28.208
It sounded good.

11:30.003 --> 11:34.172
I started moving around to the music,

11:34.257 --> 11:36.090
swinging my hips.

11:38.677 --> 11:41.220
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

11:41.305 --> 11:44.307
and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,

11:44.391 --> 11:45.975
and guess what?

11:58.322 --> 12:01.157
This is not for children's eyes.

12:03.702 --> 12:05.494
Some years later,
that handsome young man

12:05.579 --> 12:08.122
who they called "The King,"

12:08.206 --> 12:10.541
well, he'd sung too many songs,

12:11.209 --> 12:13.753
had himself a heart attack,
or something.

12:14.838 --> 12:17.006
Must be hard being a king.

12:21.303 --> 12:24.138
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

12:24.890 --> 12:28.768
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

12:30.479 --> 12:35.066
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

12:38.612 --> 12:40.321
Are you coming along?

12:40.405 --> 12:43.908
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

12:43.992 --> 12:46.160
This is the bus to school.

12:49.122 --> 12:51.374
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

12:52.334 --> 12:56.337
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

13:09.351 --> 13:11.143
This seat's taken.

13:13.605 --> 13:15.106
It's taken!

13:22.989 --> 13:24.865
You can't sit here.

13:27.035 --> 13:30.454
You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

13:30.539 --> 13:32.915
'cause I don't remember being born.

13:34.543 --> 13:36.711
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

13:36.795 --> 13:39.880
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

13:39.965 --> 13:44.677
But I do remember the first time I heard

13:44.761 --> 13:47.596
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

13:48.098 --> 13:50.474
You can sit here if you want.

13:53.395 --> 13:57.273
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

13:57.983 --> 14:00.067
She was like an angel.

14:00.152 --> 14:03.069
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

14:08.033 --> 14:09.826
What's wrong with your legs?

14:09.910 --> 14:14.164
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

14:15.082 --> 14:17.250
I just sat next to her on that bus

14:17.334 --> 14:19.419
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

14:19.503 --> 14:22.213
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

14:22.298 --> 14:23.465
These are going to make me...

14:23.549 --> 14:28.303
And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.

14:28.846 --> 14:30.805
Are you stupid or something?

14:30.890 --> 14:33.892
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does. "

14:35.519 --> 14:39.189
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

14:39.857 --> 14:41.691
From that day on,
we was always together.

14:41.776 --> 14:44.611
Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.

14:48.199 --> 14:49.824
She taught me how to climb.

14:49.909 --> 14:52.619
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

14:52.703 --> 14:55.330
I showed her how to dangle.

14:55.414 --> 14:57.457
"... a good little monkey and... "

14:57.541 --> 15:02.462
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

15:04.799 --> 15:08.551
Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

15:08.636 --> 15:13.556
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

15:14.809 --> 15:18.561
For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.

15:18.646 --> 15:20.730
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

15:21.565 --> 15:24.317
She was my most special friend.

15:27.738 --> 15:29.405
My only friend.

15:33.202 --> 15:36.996
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

15:37.081 --> 15:39.457
Some people don't think so, but they do.

15:42.503 --> 15:44.087
Hey, dummy!

15:45.047 --> 15:47.131
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

15:47.216 --> 15:50.718
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp. "
Just run away, Forrest.

15:52.054 --> 15:55.139
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

15:55.224 --> 15:58.476
- Get the bikes!
Hurry up! Let's get him!

15:58.561 --> 16:01.104
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

16:01.188 --> 16:03.022
We're gonna get you!

16:03.983 --> 16:07.735
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

16:09.446 --> 16:11.364
Come back here, you!

16:25.004 --> 16:27.463
Run, Forrest!

16:27.548 --> 16:28.965
Run!

17:00.163 --> 17:03.040
Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,

17:04.166 --> 17:06.667
but I can run like the wind blows.

17:09.923 --> 17:13.008
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

17:13.843 --> 17:15.135
I was running!

17:15.219 --> 17:17.596
He's getting away! Stop him!

17:49.045 --> 17:52.047
That boy sure is a running fool.

17:56.260 --> 17:57.636
Now, remember how I told you that

17:57.720 --> 18:00.639
Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

18:00.723 --> 18:03.809
Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

18:03.893 --> 18:06.061
Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,

18:06.145 --> 18:09.481
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

18:11.317 --> 18:12.359
Jenny?

18:12.443 --> 18:14.611
He was a very loving man.

18:15.071 --> 18:19.324
He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.

18:21.077 --> 18:25.497
And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.625
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

18:29.794 --> 18:31.670
Daddy's taking a nap.

18:31.754 --> 18:33.463
Jenny!
- Come on!

18:34.924 --> 18:37.467
Jenny, where'd you run to?

18:38.803 --> 18:41.471
You'd better get back here, girl!

18:42.932 --> 18:44.599
Where you at?

18:47.979 --> 18:51.273
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

18:54.277 --> 18:55.610
Jenny!

18:55.695 --> 18:58.655
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

18:58.781 --> 18:59.905
Jenny!

18:59.990 --> 19:03.200
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

19:03.285 --> 19:05.036
far, far away from here.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.789
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

19:08.874 --> 19:09.999
far, far away from here.

19:10.125 --> 19:13.169
Mama always said
that God is mysterious.

19:13.295 --> 19:14.420
Jenny!

19:14.504 --> 19:16.839
He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.

19:16.965 --> 19:18.049
You'd better get back here!

19:18.133 --> 19:19.633
Instead,

19:20.302 --> 19:24.847
he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.

19:25.307 --> 19:29.018
She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

19:29.144 --> 19:32.313
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

19:34.900 --> 19:39.945
Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,

19:40.030 --> 19:43.157
just 'cause she said she was scared.

19:43.241 --> 19:45.701
Scared of what, I don't know,

19:45.827 --> 19:49.038
but I think it was her grandma's dog.

19:49.164 --> 19:50.915
He was a mean dog.

19:51.666 --> 19:54.376
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

19:54.461 --> 19:55.753
all the way up through high school.

19:57.714 --> 19:59.757
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

20:00.884 --> 20:03.177
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,

20:03.887 --> 20:05.346
did you hear me, stupid?

20:05.430 --> 20:06.639
- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!

20:06.723 --> 20:08.849
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

20:08.934 --> 20:11.685
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

20:11.770 --> 20:13.938
Run, Forrest! Run!

20:14.022 --> 20:17.566
You better be running, stupid!
Come on, dummy!

20:19.528 --> 20:23.030
- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!

20:26.034 --> 20:27.701
Jack rabbit!

20:36.128 --> 20:37.378
Yeah!

20:38.213 --> 20:40.381
Go! Go! Go!

20:42.092 --> 20:43.717
Run, Forrest!

20:46.721 --> 20:50.307
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

20:51.893 --> 20:54.395
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

21:23.425 --> 21:27.595
- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

21:28.596 --> 21:30.430
Just a local idiot.

21:31.098 --> 21:34.601
And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.

21:41.192 --> 21:43.818
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

21:43.944 --> 21:45.528
- Okay!
- Run!

21:45.613 --> 21:49.157
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

22:00.628 --> 22:04.172
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

22:06.550 --> 22:09.302
No! Turn! Go!

22:20.522 --> 22:24.150
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

22:24.235 --> 22:26.110
but he sure is fast!

22:29.156 --> 22:34.160
Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.

22:35.496 --> 22:37.413
Federal troops enforcing a court order

22:37.498 --> 22:40.500
integrated the University
of Alabama today.

22:40.584 --> 22:41.793
Two negroes were admitted,

22:41.877 --> 22:45.171
but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat

22:45.256 --> 22:46.798
to stand in the school house door.

22:46.882 --> 22:51.552
Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...

22:51.679 --> 22:53.680
Earl, what's going on?

22:53.764 --> 22:57.100
- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?

22:57.184 --> 22:58.851
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

22:58.936 --> 23:00.728
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

23:00.854 --> 23:05.358
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

23:05.859 --> 23:07.902
With us? They do?

23:08.862 --> 23:11.364
Shortly after Governor
Wallace had carried out his promise

23:11.448 --> 23:12.657
to block the doorway,

23:12.741 --> 23:14.701
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense

23:14.785 --> 23:16.786
then to use military force.

23:16.870 --> 23:19.580
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,

23:19.707 --> 23:22.959
commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.

23:23.043 --> 23:26.754
...because these National Guardsmen
are here today

23:26.839 --> 23:29.382
as federal soldiers for Alabamans.

23:29.466 --> 23:33.386
They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.

23:33.470 --> 23:35.888
We are winning in this fight,

23:35.973 --> 23:38.975
because we are awakening
the American people

23:39.059 --> 23:42.395
to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,

23:42.479 --> 23:48.776
just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.

23:52.239 --> 23:54.699
And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama

23:54.783 --> 23:57.075
in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated

23:57.160 --> 24:00.162
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

24:00.246 --> 24:03.332
had been signed up
for summer classes.

24:05.918 --> 24:08.754
Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am...

24:09.297 --> 24:11.256
Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.

24:11.341 --> 24:14.885
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...

24:14.969 --> 24:17.095
Say, wasn't that Gump?

24:17.180 --> 24:21.266
- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.

24:26.022 --> 24:27.856
A few years later,
that angry little man

24:27.940 --> 24:30.442
at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea

24:30.526 --> 24:32.694
and ran for president.

24:35.782 --> 24:38.450
But somebody thought that it wasn't.

24:40.161 --> 24:42.204
But he didn't die.

24:46.793 --> 24:48.460
My bus is here.

24:49.170 --> 24:52.297
- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.

24:53.299 --> 24:55.467
It was nice talking to you.

24:58.388 --> 25:02.474
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

25:03.351 --> 25:04.810
I was in college.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.103
Did you go to a girls' college,

25:06.187 --> 25:08.021
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

25:08.147 --> 25:09.147
It was co-ed.

25:09.232 --> 25:11.942
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

25:12.026 --> 25:14.361
It was a college just for girls.

25:14.487 --> 25:17.656
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

25:48.396 --> 25:50.021
That hurts.

26:00.783 --> 26:02.951
Forrest! Forrest!

26:05.204 --> 26:08.123
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
Jesus!

26:08.207 --> 26:09.332
What are you doing?

26:09.417 --> 26:11.084
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

26:11.210 --> 26:14.880
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

26:14.964 --> 26:16.047
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

26:16.132 --> 26:18.717
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

26:18.801 --> 26:21.761
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

26:21.888 --> 26:24.055
He doesn't know any better!

26:25.807 --> 26:28.476
Forrest, why did you do that?

26:31.438 --> 26:34.398
I brought you some chocolate.

26:34.774 --> 26:36.484
I'm sorry.

26:38.653 --> 26:41.947
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

26:45.660 --> 26:47.244
Look at you.

26:49.331 --> 26:51.415
Come on. Come on.

26:58.924 --> 27:00.799
- Is this your room?
- Shh!

27:05.263 --> 27:07.515
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

27:08.850 --> 27:11.685
about who you're gonna be?

27:11.770 --> 27:13.562
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

27:13.647 --> 27:15.523
Aren't I going to be me?

27:15.607 --> 27:19.276
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

27:20.195 --> 27:23.447
You know? I want to be famous.

27:25.158 --> 27:27.952
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

27:29.162 --> 27:32.289
I just want to be on an empty stage

27:32.374 --> 27:34.667
with my guitar, my voice.

27:36.503 --> 27:37.962
Just me.

27:39.464 --> 27:42.800
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

27:45.470 --> 27:48.806
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

27:56.314 --> 27:59.191
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

28:00.652 --> 28:04.488
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

28:33.435 --> 28:35.853
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

28:44.404 --> 28:46.113
It's all right.

28:48.950 --> 28:51.118
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

28:59.793 --> 29:02.545
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

29:07.384 --> 29:08.551
No.

29:14.767 --> 29:17.894
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

29:17.978 --> 29:20.021
I don't care.
I don't like her, anyway.

29:20.105 --> 29:23.483
Run! Run! Run!

29:23.567 --> 29:28.071
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

29:35.996 --> 29:40.208
College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.

29:40.292 --> 29:43.544
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,

29:43.629 --> 29:47.423
where you get to meet
the President of the United States.

29:47.508 --> 29:49.092
President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate

29:49.176 --> 29:52.762
All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.

29:53.347 --> 29:55.348
Now, the really good thing
about meeting

29:55.432 --> 29:59.227
the President of the United States
is the food.

29:59.311 --> 30:02.021
They put you in this little room
with just about anything

30:02.106 --> 30:04.607
you'd want to eat or drink.

30:05.109 --> 30:08.569
And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

30:08.654 --> 30:11.322
and number two, they was free,

30:11.448 --> 30:14.492
I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.

30:17.454 --> 30:19.580
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

30:19.665 --> 30:21.416
It's an honor, sir.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.584
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

30:23.669 --> 30:25.294
Very good, sir.

30:26.130 --> 30:28.548
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

30:28.632 --> 30:30.383
Very good, sir.

30:30.467 --> 30:34.137
- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.

30:34.805 --> 30:37.098
I believe he said
he had to "go pee. "

30:52.322 --> 30:55.199
Sometime later,
for no particular reason,

30:55.325 --> 30:57.702
somebody shot that
nice young President,

30:57.828 --> 31:00.204
when he was riding in his car.

31:00.831 --> 31:04.959
And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,

31:05.043 --> 31:07.170
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

31:08.630 --> 31:11.048
It must be hard being brothers.

31:12.050 --> 31:13.259
I wouldn't know.

31:13.844 --> 31:15.219
Forrest Gump.

31:15.345 --> 31:16.596
Now can you believe it?

31:16.680 --> 31:20.600
After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.

31:20.684 --> 31:22.684
Congratulations, son.

31:23.478 --> 31:25.520
Mama was so proud.

31:26.856 --> 31:30.692
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

31:30.818 --> 31:32.903
Congratulations, son.

31:33.029 --> 31:36.031
Have you given any thought
to your future?

31:37.867 --> 31:39.201
Thought?

31:40.661 --> 31:42.496
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

31:42.580 --> 31:45.582
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

31:45.708 --> 31:48.335
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

31:48.419 --> 31:52.380
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

31:52.715 --> 31:54.508
This seat's taken.

31:56.385 --> 31:57.761
Taken.

32:00.681 --> 32:03.475
At first, it seemed like
I made a mistake,

32:03.559 --> 32:05.602
seeing how it was only my induction day

32:05.728 --> 32:08.438
and I was already getting yelled at.

32:11.526 --> 32:13.777
You can sit down if you want to.

32:13.903 --> 32:17.739
I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.

32:17.865 --> 32:20.450
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

32:20.952 --> 32:24.579
No, but I been on a real big boat.

32:25.373 --> 32:28.166
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

32:28.251 --> 32:30.752
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

32:30.878 --> 32:33.630
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

32:33.756 --> 32:35.799
when I was about maybe nine.

32:35.925 --> 32:40.053
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

32:40.888 --> 32:45.767
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

32:46.435 --> 32:50.063
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

32:50.147 --> 32:53.817
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

32:54.777 --> 32:57.195
So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

32:57.280 --> 32:59.197
and his mama cooked shrimp,

33:01.450 --> 33:04.327
and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

33:04.453 --> 33:07.414
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

33:07.498 --> 33:08.707
Bubba's family knew everything

33:08.791 --> 33:11.418
there was to know
about the shrimping business.

33:11.502 --> 33:14.546
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

33:14.630 --> 33:17.632
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

33:17.758 --> 33:20.093
after I get out the Army.

33:22.763 --> 33:23.805
Okay.

33:24.015 --> 33:28.101
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

33:28.185 --> 33:30.729
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

33:30.813 --> 33:34.190
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

33:34.317 --> 33:36.651
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

33:36.777 --> 33:39.529
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

33:39.655 --> 33:42.616
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

33:43.618 --> 33:45.493
Listen up, people!

33:45.620 --> 33:49.788
Now, for some reason, I fit in
the Army like one of them round pegs.

33:49.873 --> 33:51.123
It's not really hard.

33:51.207 --> 33:54.835
You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,

33:54.961 --> 33:58.923
and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

33:59.007 --> 34:00.466
Is that clear?

34:00.550 --> 34:02.676
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

34:03.178 --> 34:06.472
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

34:06.556 --> 34:10.309
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

34:10.393 --> 34:13.812
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

34:13.897 --> 34:16.607
less what you spend on gas, you can...

34:16.690 --> 34:19.485
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

34:21.862 --> 34:24.614
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

34:24.699 --> 34:26.367
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

34:26.493 --> 34:29.911
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

34:30.038 --> 34:32.498
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

34:32.581 --> 34:34.875
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

34:35.001 --> 34:36.835
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.005
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

34:42.092 --> 34:45.886
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

34:45.971 --> 34:50.724
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

34:50.809 --> 34:53.811
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

34:54.103 --> 34:58.941
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

34:59.275 --> 35:02.820
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

35:02.904 --> 35:05.239
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

35:05.573 --> 35:11.537
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

35:11.621 --> 35:14.665
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

35:17.252 --> 35:19.586
That's... That's about it.

35:23.299 --> 35:26.260
Night time in the Army
is a lonely time.

35:27.137 --> 35:30.764
We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.

35:31.349 --> 35:33.851
And I'd miss Jenny.

35:37.772 --> 35:41.650
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

35:55.123 --> 35:58.250
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over

35:58.334 --> 36:01.670
some photos of her
in her college sweater,

36:01.796 --> 36:04.339
and she was thrown out of school.

36:07.886 --> 36:10.095
But that wasn't a bad thing,

36:10.180 --> 36:13.766
because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,

36:13.850 --> 36:18.895
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

36:19.688 --> 36:21.522
The first chance I got,

36:21.648 --> 36:25.318
I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.

36:25.402 --> 36:26.903
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

36:26.987 --> 36:29.447
Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.

36:29.531 --> 36:32.283
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

36:32.367 --> 36:36.204
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,

36:36.330 --> 36:39.999
let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.

36:42.169 --> 36:44.420
All right!
Bobbi!

37:07.361 --> 37:09.445
Her dream had come true.

37:10.697 --> 37:12.698
She was a folk singer.

37:21.959 --> 37:24.210
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

37:24.294 --> 37:25.795
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

37:29.550 --> 37:31.592
Hey, honey,
this ain't Captain Kangaroo.

37:31.718 --> 37:34.262
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

37:35.305 --> 37:39.058
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

37:39.143 --> 37:41.602
I'm singing a song here.

37:43.939 --> 37:46.357
Polly, get out here!

37:46.441 --> 37:48.151
- Shut up, there!
Don't be so shy, honey.

37:48.235 --> 37:49.777
Oh, shut up!

37:52.447 --> 37:55.199
Forrest, what are you doing here?

37:55.284 --> 37:56.993
- What are you doing?
Hey!

37:57.077 --> 37:58.452
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

37:58.579 --> 38:00.580
Forrest, let me down!

38:06.420 --> 38:08.337
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

38:08.422 --> 38:10.506
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

38:10.591 --> 38:14.677
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

38:15.596 --> 38:18.764
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

38:19.266 --> 38:22.185
I can't help it. I love you.

38:23.145 --> 38:26.647
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

38:33.947 --> 38:36.949
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

38:37.826 --> 38:42.330
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

38:44.291 --> 38:45.666
Yes, I do.

38:49.629 --> 38:52.464
You think I could fly off this bridge?

38:59.138 --> 39:01.306
What do you mean, Jenny?

39:05.186 --> 39:06.686
Nothing.

39:09.649 --> 39:11.691
I gotta get out of here.

39:13.986 --> 39:15.070
Wait, Jenny...

39:15.154 --> 39:19.616
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

39:19.700 --> 39:20.992
Can I have a ride?

39:21.077 --> 39:22.619
Where you going?
- I don't care.

39:22.703 --> 39:24.079
Get in the truck.

39:24.163 --> 39:25.997
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

39:28.501 --> 39:30.835
They sending me to Vietnam.

39:33.589 --> 39:36.007
It's this whole other country.

39:38.511 --> 39:40.512
Just hang on a minute.

39:41.931 --> 39:44.975
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

39:45.059 --> 39:48.395
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

39:48.521 --> 39:50.105
Just run away.

39:51.357 --> 39:52.691
Okay.

39:57.571 --> 39:58.905
Jenny.

40:00.783 --> 40:03.076
I'll write you all the time.

40:12.211 --> 40:15.213
And just like that,
she was gone.

40:31.314 --> 40:34.649
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

41:17.942 --> 41:21.904
Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different

41:21.988 --> 41:24.865
from the United States of America.

41:24.949 --> 41:29.995
And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.

41:40.131 --> 41:43.217
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

41:43.301 --> 41:46.470
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

41:46.554 --> 41:50.099
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

41:50.183 --> 41:51.392
we can get American shrimpers

41:51.476 --> 41:53.227
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.853
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

41:54.979 --> 41:58.148
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

41:58.817 --> 42:00.734
You must be my FNGs.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.069
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

42:02.153 --> 42:04.780
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

42:04.864 --> 42:06.990
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

42:07.075 --> 42:09.910
who would love to grease an officer.

42:09.994 --> 42:13.497
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

42:14.374 --> 42:16.792
What's wrong with your lip?

42:16.876 --> 42:19.253
I was born with big gums, sir.

42:19.337 --> 42:24.049
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

42:25.218 --> 42:26.593
Where you boys from in the world?

42:26.678 --> 42:29.054
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

42:29.764 --> 42:31.265
You twins?

42:33.351 --> 42:35.769
No, we are not relations, sir.

42:38.022 --> 42:40.941
Look, it's pretty basic here.

42:41.734 --> 42:44.194
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

42:44.279 --> 42:46.947
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

42:47.031 --> 42:48.949
There is one item of GI gear

42:49.033 --> 42:53.203
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

42:53.538 --> 42:56.707
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.083
Try and keep your feet dry.

42:58.209 --> 42:59.626
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

42:59.711 --> 43:02.171
to change your socks whenever we stop.

43:02.255 --> 43:05.215
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

43:05.300 --> 43:07.593
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

43:07.719 --> 43:09.136
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

43:09.220 --> 43:11.138
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

43:11.222 --> 43:13.223
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

43:13.308 --> 43:15.851
Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.

43:15.935 --> 43:18.228
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

43:18.980 --> 43:22.441
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

43:22.650 --> 43:25.736
Somebody in his family
had fought and died

43:26.738 --> 43:30.991
in every single American war.

43:31.910 --> 43:33.911
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

43:33.995 --> 43:35.120
Get on it!

43:35.246 --> 43:38.582
I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.

43:40.293 --> 43:45.129
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

43:45.255 --> 43:47.423
Little Rock's a fine town.

43:48.091 --> 43:51.677
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

43:51.762 --> 43:54.222
draw what you need for the field.

43:54.306 --> 43:58.267
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

43:58.352 --> 44:01.229
Two standing orders in this platoon:

44:01.313 --> 44:03.981
One, take good care of your feet,

44:04.107 --> 44:09.153
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

44:15.619 --> 44:17.703
I sure hope I don't let him down.

44:29.299 --> 44:31.801
I got to see
a lot of the countryside.

44:31.885 --> 44:34.220
We would take these real long walks.

44:42.688 --> 44:46.816
And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.

44:54.658 --> 44:56.909
Hold it up!
Hold up, boys!

44:59.746 --> 45:02.081
It wasn't always fun.

45:02.165 --> 45:06.460
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,

45:06.545 --> 45:11.632
or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...

45:11.717 --> 45:13.718
Get down! Shut up!

45:14.678 --> 45:16.137
...so we did.

45:33.697 --> 45:35.865
Now, I don't know much about anything,

45:35.949 --> 45:39.785
but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.

45:39.870 --> 45:42.580
There was Dallas, from Phoenix,

45:44.291 --> 45:47.084
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

45:47.210 --> 45:49.587
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

45:49.713 --> 45:51.881
Man, what the hell's going on?

45:51.965 --> 45:56.302
And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.

45:56.386 --> 45:57.928
Nothing.

46:02.059 --> 46:04.560
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

46:04.645 --> 46:08.356
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.232
Come on, move out.

46:12.276 --> 46:14.694
Step it up. Look alive out there.

46:14.779 --> 46:19.115
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.

46:19.241 --> 46:20.617
Fire in the hole!

46:24.080 --> 46:26.414
Gump, check out that hole.

46:26.499 --> 46:29.501
And there was always something to do.

46:29.585 --> 46:32.754
- Mount them up.
Spread out! Cover his back.

46:37.802 --> 46:43.431
One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

46:44.433 --> 46:47.310
We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:

46:47.436 --> 46:49.979
Little bitty stinging rain,

46:50.690 --> 46:53.358
and big old fat rain,

46:53.818 --> 46:56.528
rain that flew in sideways.

46:56.612 --> 47:00.657
And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.

47:02.451 --> 47:04.828
Shoot, it even rained at night.

47:05.871 --> 47:08.331
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

47:08.457 --> 47:11.751
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

47:11.836 --> 47:15.672
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

47:16.632 --> 47:20.093
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

47:20.177 --> 47:22.679
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

47:22.805 --> 47:24.681
like brothers and stuff.

47:26.642 --> 47:30.311
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

47:30.396 --> 47:33.398
I got a very important question
to ask you.

47:35.025 --> 47:38.987
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

47:40.156 --> 47:41.781
Okay.

47:41.866 --> 47:45.326
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

47:45.411 --> 47:48.204
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

47:48.330 --> 47:51.624
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

47:51.709 --> 47:54.002
We ain't got to pay no rent.

47:54.086 --> 47:56.171
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

47:56.255 --> 48:00.508
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

48:00.593 --> 48:04.179
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

48:05.723 --> 48:07.515
That's a fine idea.

48:08.601 --> 48:10.727
Bubba did have a fine idea.

48:14.523 --> 48:17.609
I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

48:18.402 --> 48:21.613
I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.

48:21.697 --> 48:26.701
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

48:26.786 --> 48:29.537
and told her
how I thought about her always,

48:30.873 --> 48:33.833
and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

48:33.918 --> 48:36.419
just as soon as she had the time.

48:38.297 --> 48:40.798
I'd always let her know that I was okay.

48:42.091 --> 48:47.262
Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump. "

49:02.111 --> 49:05.864
This one day, we was out walking,
like always,

49:05.949 --> 49:08.909
and then, just like that,

49:09.828 --> 49:13.247
somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.

49:16.251 --> 49:18.085
Ambush!

49:18.586 --> 49:19.962
Take cover!

49:23.591 --> 49:24.758
Get down!

49:24.843 --> 49:26.301
Get the sixty!

49:29.472 --> 49:31.557
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

49:31.641 --> 49:33.767
Forrest, you okay?

49:36.980 --> 49:39.606
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

49:40.149 --> 49:42.568
Medic, we got a man down!

49:42.652 --> 49:45.612
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

49:46.322 --> 49:49.658
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

49:49.784 --> 49:53.287
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

49:53.955 --> 49:55.747
Misfire! Misfire!

49:58.126 --> 50:00.127
God damn it! Mac!

50:01.087 --> 50:04.506
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

50:05.466 --> 50:06.633
Jesus!

50:06.759 --> 50:08.969
My unit is down hard and hurting!

50:09.095 --> 50:12.639
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

50:13.433 --> 50:15.392
Pull back! Pull back!

50:15.476 --> 50:17.603
Run! Run, Forrest!

50:17.687 --> 50:20.022
- Pull back!
Forrest, Forrest!

50:20.148 --> 50:22.733
Run, man! Run!

50:22.817 --> 50:24.610
Pull back! Run!

50:26.446 --> 50:28.655
Run, God damn it, run!

50:49.844 --> 50:54.473
Medic! Can I get a medic?

50:54.849 --> 50:58.185
I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.

51:01.564 --> 51:05.776
I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

51:05.860 --> 51:07.818
which was a bad thing.

51:08.362 --> 51:09.904
Bubba!

51:12.032 --> 51:15.826
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.

51:19.539 --> 51:21.582
Any friendlies out there?

51:22.542 --> 51:24.710
Yeah, I've got
three over here.

51:25.337 --> 51:27.338
Where the hell are you?

51:27.923 --> 51:29.256
Bubba?

51:30.342 --> 51:33.052
And on my way back to find Bubba,

51:33.178 --> 51:35.972
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

51:36.056 --> 51:37.264
Tex!

51:39.351 --> 51:40.351
Okay.

51:40.435 --> 51:44.397
I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,

51:44.523 --> 51:48.401
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

52:03.542 --> 52:05.960
And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

52:06.086 --> 52:09.588
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me. "

52:17.264 --> 52:19.140
Can't hear... Can't hear...

52:21.435 --> 52:22.727
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

52:22.811 --> 52:25.312
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

52:27.315 --> 52:30.359
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

52:30.444 --> 52:31.694
Over.

52:31.778 --> 52:35.072
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

52:35.157 --> 52:36.991
We got Charlie all over this area.

52:37.117 --> 52:39.410
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

52:39.494 --> 52:42.872
- Six, Strongarm, we want...
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

52:42.956 --> 52:44.165
I know he's dead!

52:44.291 --> 52:47.126
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

52:47.252 --> 52:48.586
- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.
- God damn it!

52:48.670 --> 52:51.380
- Copy this transmission. Over.
- What are you doing?

52:51.465 --> 52:54.800
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

52:54.926 --> 52:57.219
Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.

52:57.304 --> 52:59.930
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

53:00.015 --> 53:03.184
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised

53:03.310 --> 53:05.269
your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.

53:05.353 --> 53:08.773
Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

53:09.649 --> 53:11.317
Something bit me!

53:18.200 --> 53:20.326
You chink son of a bitch!

53:22.829 --> 53:24.830
I can't leave the platoon.

53:24.956 --> 53:29.877
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

53:30.003 --> 53:32.129
Did you hear what I said?

53:32.839 --> 53:34.799
God damn it, put me down!

53:35.509 --> 53:37.550
Get your ass out of here!

53:40.846 --> 53:43.431
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

53:43.516 --> 53:44.849
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

53:44.975 --> 53:46.059
To get Bubba.

53:46.185 --> 53:50.021
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

53:50.147 --> 53:52.524
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

53:52.650 --> 53:55.068
I gotta find Bubba!

54:11.043 --> 54:12.502
Forrest.

54:20.261 --> 54:22.929
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

54:23.722 --> 54:25.390
I'm okay.

54:33.232 --> 54:35.066
Oh, Bubba, no...

54:35.192 --> 54:37.402
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

54:45.578 --> 54:48.246
Come on. Come on. Come on.

54:53.252 --> 54:54.752
I'm okay, Forrest.

54:56.088 --> 54:58.923
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

55:35.961 --> 55:39.088
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

55:40.132 --> 55:44.636
If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

55:44.762 --> 55:47.055
I'd of thought of something better to say.

55:47.139 --> 55:48.640
Hey, Bubba.

55:49.767 --> 55:51.142
Hey, Forrest.

55:53.479 --> 55:56.689
Forrest, why'd this happen?

55:58.025 --> 55:59.817
You got shot.

56:01.528 --> 56:05.697
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

56:06.491 --> 56:08.158
I wanna go home.

56:10.161 --> 56:12.204
Bubba was my best good friend.

56:13.164 --> 56:17.709
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

56:17.835 --> 56:20.921
Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,

56:21.005 --> 56:24.967
but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

56:30.682 --> 56:32.975
That's all I have to say about that.

56:35.353 --> 56:37.521
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

56:39.857 --> 56:42.526
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

56:44.904 --> 56:46.989
Oh, yes, sir.

56:47.073 --> 56:50.200
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

56:50.326 --> 56:55.580
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

56:55.707 --> 56:59.543
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

57:00.378 --> 57:03.880
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

57:04.007 --> 57:05.716
is the ice cream.

57:05.842 --> 57:08.427
They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.

57:08.553 --> 57:09.845
And guess what?

57:09.929 --> 57:13.056
A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.

57:15.268 --> 57:18.353
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

57:20.732 --> 57:22.899
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

57:34.620 --> 57:36.913
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

57:45.423 --> 57:46.757
Harper!

57:49.969 --> 57:52.429
Cooper, Larson,

57:54.640 --> 57:55.974
Webster,

57:57.393 --> 58:00.896
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

58:04.442 --> 58:07.736
Kyle, Nichols,

58:09.947 --> 58:15.911
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

58:17.246 --> 58:18.622
Holiday...

58:25.380 --> 58:27.631
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

58:30.968 --> 58:33.469
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

58:33.553 --> 58:35.137
- From the DMZ to the Delta...
- Turn it off!

58:35.222 --> 58:38.474
...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.

58:38.600 --> 58:40.935
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

58:43.647 --> 58:45.314
Good catch, Gump.

58:47.275 --> 58:49.443
You know how to play this?

58:50.737 --> 58:52.822
Come on, let me show you. Here.

58:54.908 --> 58:57.243
Now, the secret to this game is,

58:57.327 --> 59:03.165
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

59:06.753 --> 59:08.087
All right.

59:11.425 --> 59:15.094
For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

59:15.429 --> 59:18.347
See? Any idiot can play.

59:18.849 --> 59:21.600
So, I started playing it all the time.

59:22.769 --> 59:24.103
I played Ping-Pong

59:24.187 --> 59:27.481
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

59:35.532 --> 59:40.202
The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,

59:40.328 --> 59:42.163
whatever that means.

59:42.622 --> 59:45.875
Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.

59:51.381 --> 59:55.259
I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:08.147
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:11.275
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

01:00:11.401 --> 01:00:14.069
I should have died out there
with my men,

01:00:14.196 --> 01:00:18.157
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

01:00:18.241 --> 01:00:21.869
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

01:00:22.621 --> 01:00:23.704
Do you see that?

01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:27.583
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

01:00:30.921 --> 01:00:32.546
Yes, sir, I do.

01:00:36.218 --> 01:00:38.260
Did you hear what I said?

01:00:39.137 --> 01:00:40.888
You cheated me.

01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:42.139
I had a destiny.

01:00:42.224 --> 01:00:45.768
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

01:00:46.436 --> 01:00:50.481
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

01:01:00.116 --> 01:01:02.825
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:08.331
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.627
I had a destiny.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:18.967
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.475
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.208
Look at me.

01:01:53.544 --> 01:02:01.217
What am I gonna do now?

01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:13.062
PFC Gump?

01:02:14.607 --> 01:02:16.024
Yes, sir!

01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:18.192
As you were.

01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:22.530
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:27.201
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:37.712
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

01:02:38.631 --> 01:02:40.423
They sent him home.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.182
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:53.770
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:57.231
regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.

01:02:57.316 --> 01:02:59.442
President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.194
to men
from each of the Armed Services.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:04.197
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.994
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:13.247
- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:16.292
I'd kind of like to see that.

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:31.890
God damn, son.

01:03:34.018 --> 01:03:37.854
After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:41.441
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:43.068
Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.653
what do you want me to do with them?

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:46.488
What are you doing here
so late?

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:50.617
It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:53.870
with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:56.581
and some of them people were loud
and pushy.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.626
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

01:04:00.461 --> 01:04:03.422
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.218
Follow me, let's go!

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:11.638
Come on. Let's go.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.271
Stand here.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:24.901
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.320
Okay.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:31.491
There was this man giving a little talk.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:35.078
And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:36.621
Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.499
And he liked to say the "F" word.

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:42.961
A lot. "F" this and "F" that.

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.380
And every time he said the "F" word,

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:48.216
people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.927
...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.765
Yeah! Yeah!

01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:57.851
Come on, man, come up here, man.

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:01.605
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:06.026
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

01:05:18.831 --> 01:05:21.374
Tell us a little bit about the war, man.

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:23.210
The war in Vietnam?

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:26.213
- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
- Yeah!

01:05:46.567 --> 01:05:47.651
Peace!

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:49.402
Come on, man, go!

01:05:49.695 --> 01:05:51.655
Come on!
Peace!

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:52.781
Well...

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:56.326
There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:01.247
...there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.

01:06:05.043 --> 01:06:08.838
In Vietnam, your...

01:06:18.598 --> 01:06:19.682
Hey, what the hell are you...

01:06:19.766 --> 01:06:22.518
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

01:06:22.602 --> 01:06:25.104
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

01:06:26.523 --> 01:06:28.190
We can't hear you!

01:06:29.901 --> 01:06:31.902
We can't hear anything!

01:06:32.612 --> 01:06:35.114
- This one! This one! Give me that!
Turn it up!

01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:36.615
Speak up!

01:06:37.409 --> 01:06:38.868
That's it!

01:06:39.953 --> 01:06:42.788
...and that's all I have to say about that.

01:06:50.088 --> 01:06:53.048
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:57.052
What's your name, man?

01:06:57.137 --> 01:06:59.763
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

01:07:00.974 --> 01:07:02.141
Forrest Gump!

01:07:02.267 --> 01:07:03.642
- Gump!
- Gump!

01:07:05.145 --> 01:07:08.898
Forrest! Forrest!

01:07:12.944 --> 01:07:15.321
- Jenny!
- Forrest!

01:07:32.088 --> 01:07:34.757
Hey! Hey!

01:07:42.849 --> 01:07:45.976
It was the happiest moment of my life.

01:07:48.313 --> 01:07:51.690
Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.

01:07:53.026 --> 01:07:54.610
She showed me around,

01:07:54.694 --> 01:07:57.279
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.

01:07:57.364 --> 01:07:58.697
Shut that blind, man.

01:07:58.823 --> 01:08:01.033
And get your white ass
away from that window.

01:08:01.117 --> 01:08:03.202
Don't you know we in a war here?

01:08:04.037 --> 01:08:05.454
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

01:08:05.538 --> 01:08:07.456
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.625
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

01:08:09.709 --> 01:08:11.460
from the racial onslaught of the pig

01:08:11.544 --> 01:08:13.629
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

01:08:13.713 --> 01:08:17.049
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.886
Who's the baby killer?

01:08:22.013 --> 01:08:24.723
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

01:08:24.808 --> 01:08:26.557
Forrest, this is Wesley.

01:08:26.642 --> 01:08:27.934
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

01:08:28.018 --> 01:08:30.645
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:32.145
Let me tell you something else.

01:08:32.231 --> 01:08:36.484
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

01:08:36.568 --> 01:08:40.154
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

01:08:40.238 --> 01:08:43.908
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:45.910
to die for a country that hates them.

01:08:45.995 --> 01:08:49.162
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

01:08:49.247 --> 01:08:52.332
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

01:08:52.417 --> 01:08:54.002
as they sleep in their beds at night.

01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:55.252
You are a fucking asshole!

01:08:55.337 --> 01:08:58.715
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

01:09:08.017 --> 01:09:11.227
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

01:09:13.188 --> 01:09:14.439
Forrest!

01:09:15.024 --> 01:09:16.774
Stop it! Stop it!

01:09:23.407 --> 01:09:24.782
Oh, God...

01:09:25.617 --> 01:09:28.036
I shouldn't have brought you here.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.747
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

01:09:32.916 --> 01:09:35.542
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:42.216
Come on, Forrest.

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:51.934
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

01:09:54.813 --> 01:09:57.148
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

01:09:57.232 --> 01:09:59.567
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

01:10:01.403 --> 01:10:03.654
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

01:10:05.574 --> 01:10:08.159
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:21.089
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

01:10:22.466 --> 01:10:25.676
You look handsome in it. You do.

01:10:29.765 --> 01:10:31.682
- You know what?
- What?

01:10:35.312 --> 01:10:38.940
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

01:10:40.526 --> 01:10:42.276
Me, too, Forrest.

01:10:42.361 --> 01:10:47.031
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.

01:10:49.118 --> 01:10:52.286
She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.

01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:56.957
And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind

01:10:57.041 --> 01:11:00.127
and learn how to live in harmony,

01:11:00.211 --> 01:11:02.546
which must be out west somewhere,

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.965
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

01:11:05.049 --> 01:11:07.300
Try to love one another right now

01:11:07.385 --> 01:11:08.552
Hey!

01:11:09.512 --> 01:11:12.055
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.015
- I'll go.
- Far out.

01:11:15.476 --> 01:11:18.645
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

01:11:20.231 --> 01:11:22.315
I didn't want it to end.

01:11:23.109 --> 01:11:25.527
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

01:11:26.529 --> 01:11:28.321
I have to, Forrest.

01:11:29.323 --> 01:11:30.574
Jenny?

01:11:32.743 --> 01:11:35.328
Things got a little out of hand.

01:11:35.413 --> 01:11:39.249
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

01:11:40.918 --> 01:11:43.712
I would never hurt you, you know that.

01:11:46.841 --> 01:11:48.842
You know what I think?

01:11:50.344 --> 01:11:55.599
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:11.198
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

01:12:20.625 --> 01:12:23.793
I want you to have this.

01:12:28.466 --> 01:12:30.634
Forrest, I can't keep this.

01:12:32.303 --> 01:12:36.556
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

01:12:38.601 --> 01:12:40.769
Why are you so good to me?

01:12:42.271 --> 01:12:43.813
You're my girl.

01:12:45.816 --> 01:12:47.943
I'll always be your girl.

01:13:28.358 --> 01:13:33.195
And just like that,
she was gone, out of my life again.

01:13:34.698 --> 01:13:37.032
That's one small step for man,

01:13:39.035 --> 01:13:41.870
one giant leap for mankind.

01:13:47.544 --> 01:13:50.045
I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,

01:13:50.171 --> 01:13:53.382
but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists

01:13:53.466 --> 01:13:55.092
was to play Ping-Pong.

01:13:55.176 --> 01:13:57.469
So, I was in the Special Services,

01:13:57.554 --> 01:14:00.806
traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans

01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:03.309
and showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.

01:14:03.393 --> 01:14:05.311
I was so good that some years later

01:14:05.395 --> 01:14:09.023
the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.

01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:12.067
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

01:14:12.152 --> 01:14:14.570
in like a million years,
or something like that.

01:14:14.696 --> 01:14:18.115
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

01:14:18.199 --> 01:14:20.993
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

01:14:21.077 --> 01:14:24.163
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

01:14:24.873 --> 01:14:27.166
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:29.918
Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.

01:14:36.676 --> 01:14:38.427
Mr. Gump, have a seat.

01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.098
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

01:14:43.767 --> 01:14:45.017
- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.

01:14:45.101 --> 01:14:48.437
Can you tell us, what was China like?

01:14:51.691 --> 01:14:56.945
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.

01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:58.614
No possessions?

01:15:01.242 --> 01:15:04.453
And in China, they never go to church.

01:15:05.747 --> 01:15:07.289
No religion, too?

01:15:07.374 --> 01:15:08.374
Oh.

01:15:09.376 --> 01:15:12.669
- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

01:15:14.464 --> 01:15:16.840
Some years later,
that nice young man from England

01:15:16.925 --> 01:15:19.551
was on his way home
to see his little boy

01:15:19.636 --> 01:15:22.638
and was signing some autographs,

01:15:22.764 --> 01:15:26.725
and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.

01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:33.607
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:36.985
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

01:15:39.781 --> 01:15:41.407
Lieutenant Dan!

01:15:41.491 --> 01:15:45.953
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:49.331
Yes, sir, they surely did.

01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:51.416
They gave you,

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.670
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

01:15:55.754 --> 01:16:00.007
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

01:16:00.676 --> 01:16:03.177
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

01:16:04.346 --> 01:16:05.513
Yes, sir.

01:16:07.683 --> 01:16:10.518
Well, then, that's just perfect!

01:16:12.438 --> 01:16:14.772
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

01:16:14.857 --> 01:16:17.108
God damn bless America.

01:16:18.026 --> 01:16:19.318
Hey!

01:16:21.113 --> 01:16:22.447
Oh, God!

01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:27.368
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

01:16:28.495 --> 01:16:31.247
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.

01:16:31.331 --> 01:16:33.291
And because he didn't have no legs,

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:36.544
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

01:16:39.423 --> 01:16:41.883
Take a right. Take a right.

01:16:44.511 --> 01:16:47.054
Hey! Come on, already!

01:16:47.139 --> 01:16:49.932
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

01:16:50.017 --> 01:16:52.560
I'm living off the government tit.

01:16:54.188 --> 01:16:55.563
Sucking it dry!

01:16:55.647 --> 01:16:57.690
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

01:16:57.774 --> 01:16:59.484
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

01:16:59.568 --> 01:17:02.153
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

01:17:09.203 --> 01:17:12.955
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

01:17:17.377 --> 01:17:20.796
You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.594
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:30.848
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.817
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

01:17:41.902 --> 01:17:44.320
that's all they ever talk about.

01:17:45.489 --> 01:17:48.449
Jesus this and Jesus that.

01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:52.203
Have I found Jesus?

01:17:52.829 --> 01:17:55.831
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

01:17:56.708 --> 01:18:01.379
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

01:18:02.756 --> 01:18:05.049
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

01:18:06.051 --> 01:18:09.845
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:12.098
Did you hear what I said?

01:18:13.141 --> 01:18:17.144
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:20.188
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

01:18:20.273 --> 01:18:23.650
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

01:18:27.321 --> 01:18:29.948
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

01:18:31.867 --> 01:18:32.909
Oh?

01:18:37.748 --> 01:18:39.124
Well,

01:18:42.086 --> 01:18:45.463
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

01:18:45.548 --> 01:18:48.049
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:48.134 --> 01:18:53.263
We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

01:18:53.347 --> 01:18:55.181
This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.

01:18:55.266 --> 01:18:57.475
What the hell
is in Bayou La Batre?

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.894
Shrimping boats.
Shrimping boats?

01:18:59.979 --> 01:19:02.397
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:03.940
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

01:19:04.025 --> 01:19:05.567
soon as I have some money.

01:19:05.651 --> 01:19:08.486
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

01:19:08.571 --> 01:19:11.281
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

01:19:11.365 --> 01:19:14.784
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

01:19:14.869 --> 01:19:18.330
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

01:19:18.414 --> 01:19:21.124
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:21.208 --> 01:19:23.668
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

01:19:25.463 --> 01:19:27.922
Now hear this!

01:19:28.674 --> 01:19:32.510
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

01:19:33.262 --> 01:19:34.679
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

01:19:34.764 --> 01:19:37.223
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

01:19:37.308 --> 01:19:40.852
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

01:19:40.936 --> 01:19:45.273
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

01:19:45.358 --> 01:19:48.360
Danny, what are you
complaining about?

01:19:48.444 --> 01:19:51.029
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

01:19:51.113 --> 01:19:54.741
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

01:19:55.576 --> 01:19:59.788
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

01:20:00.873 --> 01:20:04.084
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

01:20:04.168 --> 01:20:05.627
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

01:20:05.711 --> 01:20:07.045
'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

01:20:07.129 --> 01:20:08.630
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

01:20:08.714 --> 01:20:11.758
Well, well, I had company.

01:20:12.635 --> 01:20:16.304
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

01:20:16.931 --> 01:20:21.059
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

01:20:21.143 --> 01:20:24.437
Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.

01:20:24.522 --> 01:20:27.065
It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:29.442
I began to think about Jenny,

01:20:30.361 --> 01:20:34.823
wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.

01:20:57.429 --> 01:21:00.931
Eight, seven, six, five,

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:04.518
four, three, two, one!

01:21:04.644 --> 01:21:07.312
Happy New Year!

01:21:23.788 --> 01:21:26.498
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

01:22:01.785 --> 01:22:05.454
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

01:22:06.122 --> 01:22:07.539
What's his problem?

01:22:07.624 --> 01:22:09.875
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:12.002
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

01:22:12.086 --> 01:22:13.170
What did you say?

01:22:13.254 --> 01:22:14.671
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

01:22:14.756 --> 01:22:16.924
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

01:22:17.008 --> 01:22:18.967
Hey, don't you push her!
You shut up!

01:22:19.052 --> 01:22:21.094
- Don't you ever call him stupid!
What's the matter, baby?

01:22:21.179 --> 01:22:22.888
- Why are you so upset?
Just get the hell out of here.

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:24.056
- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:25.641
You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not!

01:22:25.725 --> 01:22:27.601
- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!

01:22:27.685 --> 01:22:28.727
Go on! Get out of here!

01:22:28.812 --> 01:22:30.103
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

01:22:30.188 --> 01:22:31.563
Get out of here!

01:22:33.191 --> 01:22:35.734
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

01:22:41.115 --> 01:22:42.324
No, no.

01:23:07.475 --> 01:23:11.436
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

01:23:12.021 --> 01:23:14.314
She tasted like cigarettes.

01:23:30.497 --> 01:23:32.039
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured

01:23:32.124 --> 01:23:34.959
there's some things
you just can't change.

01:23:35.085 --> 01:23:40.214
He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:47.597
Happy New Year, Gump.

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:53.769
The US Ping-Pong team

01:23:53.854 --> 01:23:56.147
met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.983
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:03.029
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

01:24:03.113 --> 01:24:05.364
So, I went, again.

01:24:06.199 --> 01:24:09.660
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:13.372
Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.

01:24:13.457 --> 01:24:16.834
So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

01:24:16.919 --> 01:24:19.921
- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?

01:24:20.005 --> 01:24:22.632
- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:24:22.716 --> 01:24:25.843
I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.

01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:27.929
I'll have my people
take care of it for you.

01:24:28.555 --> 01:24:29.680
Security, Frank Wills.

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:33.351
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:36.103
over to that office across the way.

01:24:36.188 --> 01:24:39.065
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:41.859
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

01:24:41.944 --> 01:24:43.569
Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

01:24:43.654 --> 01:24:45.363
- Thank you.
- No problem.

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:47.365
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:24:50.994 --> 01:24:56.374
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.501
Vice President Ford

01:24:58.585 --> 01:25:03.089
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:09.261
As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...

01:25:14.518 --> 01:25:16.060
Sergeant Gump.

01:25:16.561 --> 01:25:18.771
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

01:25:18.855 --> 01:25:21.983
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

01:25:25.404 --> 01:25:28.155
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.199
For the Army it does.

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:37.707
And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

01:25:43.005 --> 01:25:44.796
So, I went home.

01:26:06.277 --> 01:26:09.696
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

01:26:11.323 --> 01:26:12.866
- Louise, he's here.
Now, when I got home,

01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:16.995
I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.

01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:19.414
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

01:26:19.498 --> 01:26:22.584
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

01:26:22.668 --> 01:26:26.463
One man even left a check for $25,000

01:26:26.547 --> 01:26:30.008
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

01:26:30.134 --> 01:26:32.802
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.888
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

01:26:34.972 --> 01:26:37.891
I know that. I know that.

01:26:37.975 --> 01:26:40.643
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:45.398
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

01:26:45.483 --> 01:26:47.609
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
- That Mama, she sure was right.

01:26:47.693 --> 01:26:50.195
- You look real good.
- It's funny how things work out.

01:26:50.321 --> 01:26:53.448
I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,

01:26:53.532 --> 01:26:55.784
and I always try to keep my promise.

01:26:55.868 --> 01:26:57.410
So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre

01:26:57.495 --> 01:27:01.247
to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.

01:27:01.332 --> 01:27:05.001
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

01:27:05.711 --> 01:27:07.962
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

01:27:08.047 --> 01:27:09.422
I guess.

01:27:10.424 --> 01:27:14.010
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

01:27:16.013 --> 01:27:18.556
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

01:27:21.685 --> 01:27:25.730
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

01:27:28.526 --> 01:27:35.323
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

01:27:36.408 --> 01:27:39.994
Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,

01:27:40.079 --> 01:27:42.038
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:45.375
and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.

01:27:45.918 --> 01:27:47.710
Tell me something.

01:27:48.754 --> 01:27:50.880
Are you stupid
or something?

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:53.007
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

01:27:53.092 --> 01:27:56.052
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:59.097
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

01:27:59.223 --> 01:28:03.017
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

01:28:03.102 --> 01:28:04.352
which everybody knows isn't true,

01:28:04.436 --> 01:28:05.812
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

01:28:05.896 --> 01:28:08.064
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

01:28:09.483 --> 01:28:15.404
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

01:28:16.156 --> 01:28:17.906
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

01:28:39.596 --> 01:28:42.848
Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

01:28:42.932 --> 01:28:45.267
but you know what I found out?

01:28:46.936 --> 01:28:49.271
Shrimping is tough.

01:28:51.482 --> 01:28:53.317
I only caught five.

01:28:53.443 --> 01:28:55.277
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

01:29:00.116 --> 01:29:01.867
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:04.620
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

01:29:06.998 --> 01:29:11.835
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,

01:29:13.004 --> 01:29:16.215
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

01:29:37.237 --> 01:29:40.072
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,

01:29:40.156 --> 01:29:42.699
but I thought about her a lot,

01:29:42.825 --> 01:29:46.286
and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.

01:31:32.559 --> 01:31:35.102
I thought about Jenny all the time.

01:31:59.753 --> 01:32:00.920
Hey!

01:32:24.778 --> 01:32:29.448
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

01:32:29.533 --> 01:32:33.452
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

01:32:33.537 --> 01:32:37.289
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

01:32:37.374 --> 01:32:39.667
Yes, I know that.

01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:42.044
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:46.715
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

01:32:48.343 --> 01:32:55.224
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:57.935
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

01:32:58.019 --> 01:33:01.147
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

01:33:01.231 --> 01:33:05.234
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir. "

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:06.694
No, sir.

01:33:15.578 --> 01:33:17.871
That's my boat.

01:33:20.458 --> 01:33:25.920
I have a feeling if we head
due east, we'll find some shrimp,

01:33:26.046 --> 01:33:27.630
so take a left.

01:33:29.049 --> 01:33:31.968
- Take a left!
- Which way?

01:33:32.052 --> 01:33:34.721
Over there! They're over there!

01:33:35.389 --> 01:33:39.225
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

01:33:40.436 --> 01:33:44.564
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

01:33:46.942 --> 01:33:50.570
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

01:33:52.156 --> 01:33:53.740
That's where we'll find them.

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:10.548
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.

01:34:11.258 --> 01:34:14.469
How are we going to find them?

01:34:14.595 --> 01:34:17.096
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

01:34:23.729 --> 01:34:26.397
So, I went to church every Sunday.

01:34:27.650 --> 01:34:29.651
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

01:34:29.777 --> 01:34:32.779
though I think
he left the praying up to me.

01:34:48.254 --> 01:34:52.632
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

01:34:53.467 --> 01:34:59.180
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.

01:35:16.031 --> 01:35:20.868
You'll never sink this boat!
- Now, me, I was scared,

01:35:20.995 --> 01:35:24.038
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

01:35:24.164 --> 01:35:25.498
Come on!

01:35:28.627 --> 01:35:33.840
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:35:35.968 --> 01:35:40.345
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

01:35:40.471 --> 01:35:44.349
I'm right here! Come and get me!

01:35:46.144 --> 01:35:50.022
You'll never sink this boat!

01:35:52.066 --> 01:35:54.234
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.903
destroying nearly everything in its path.

01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:59.531
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

01:35:59.699 --> 01:36:02.075
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:06.038
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

01:36:06.164 --> 01:36:09.291
Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,

01:36:09.375 --> 01:36:12.836
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

01:36:13.212 --> 01:36:15.839
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

01:36:16.549 --> 01:36:18.550
After that,
shrimping was easy.

01:36:24.223 --> 01:36:27.351
Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails

01:36:27.435 --> 01:36:31.563
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

01:36:31.731 --> 01:36:34.983
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

01:36:35.068 --> 01:36:39.655
We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 Jennys,

01:36:39.739 --> 01:36:43.241
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

01:36:43.576 --> 01:36:46.870
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.789
Hold on there, boy.

01:36:48.915 --> 01:36:53.460
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

01:36:53.586 --> 01:36:56.588
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

01:36:58.216 --> 01:37:02.260
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

01:37:04.972 --> 01:37:07.766
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:15.899
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

01:37:16.317 --> 01:37:20.946
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

01:37:22.657 --> 01:37:25.325
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

01:37:25.451 --> 01:37:26.952
Well, yes, I would.

01:37:31.958 --> 01:37:34.000
That's him right there.

01:37:36.337 --> 01:37:38.588
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

01:37:39.757 --> 01:37:40.799
Forrest,

01:37:46.347 --> 01:37:49.141
I never thanked you for saving my life.

01:38:15.167 --> 01:38:21.464
He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.

01:38:29.139 --> 01:38:31.348
For the second time in 17 days,

01:38:31.475 --> 01:38:34.935
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:36.312
Base to Jenny 1.

01:38:36.396 --> 01:38:39.899
- Base to Jenny 1.
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

01:38:39.983 --> 01:38:41.484
Forrest has a phone call.

01:38:41.568 --> 01:38:44.069
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

01:38:44.154 --> 01:38:47.531
- He is indisposed at the moment.
- His mama's sick.

01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.596
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

01:39:13.433 --> 01:39:15.392
Hi, Forrest.

01:39:16.353 --> 01:39:18.896
I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

01:39:25.570 --> 01:39:28.739
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

01:39:40.085 --> 01:39:44.046
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

01:39:47.384 --> 01:39:49.760
Come on in, sit down over here.

01:40:04.109 --> 01:40:07.611
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

01:40:08.613 --> 01:40:10.489
It's just my time.

01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:16.120
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

01:40:17.747 --> 01:40:20.124
Death is just a part of life,

01:40:21.126 --> 01:40:23.752
something we're all destined to do.

01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:29.967
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

01:40:30.802 --> 01:40:34.387
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:40.351
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

01:40:41.854 --> 01:40:45.106
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

01:40:48.986 --> 01:40:51.112
What's my destiny, Mama?

01:40:53.282 --> 01:40:56.492
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

01:40:57.786 --> 01:41:00.747
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

01:41:00.831 --> 01:41:02.999
You never know
what you're going to get.

01:41:03.125 --> 01:41:07.503
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

01:41:07.588 --> 01:41:09.797
I will miss you, Forrest.

01:41:11.634 --> 01:41:15.678
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

01:41:17.181 --> 01:41:20.516
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

01:41:23.562 --> 01:41:26.856
And that's all I have to say about that.

01:41:33.697 --> 01:41:35.990
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

01:41:36.075 --> 01:41:38.868
There'll be another one along shortly.

01:41:42.706 --> 01:41:46.292
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

01:41:46.377 --> 01:41:49.504
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

01:41:50.005 --> 01:41:53.216
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

01:41:53.342 --> 01:41:56.552
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

01:41:57.930 --> 01:42:01.599
So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

01:42:01.725 --> 01:42:04.435
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

01:42:04.561 --> 01:42:09.148
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

01:42:09.233 --> 01:42:10.817
And so then, I got a call from him saying

01:42:10.901 --> 01:42:14.362
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

01:42:14.446 --> 01:42:16.739
"That's good. One less thing. "

01:42:19.785 --> 01:42:23.705
Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

01:42:24.456 --> 01:42:27.291
and the rest is just for showing off.

01:42:27.376 --> 01:42:31.254
So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,

01:42:33.716 --> 01:42:37.885
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

01:42:40.764 --> 01:42:45.309
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

01:42:45.436 --> 01:42:48.062
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

01:42:52.276 --> 01:42:53.985
You know what?

01:42:55.237 --> 01:42:58.239
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

01:42:58.323 --> 01:42:59.949
That smells wonderful.

01:43:00.784 --> 01:43:04.703
And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

01:43:04.787 --> 01:43:07.122
I cut that grass for free.

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:13.795
But at night time
when there was nothing to do

01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.256
and the house was all empty,

01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:19.634
I'd always think of Jenny.

01:44:23.324 --> 01:44:26.493
And then, she was there.

01:44:59.485 --> 01:45:02.654
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

01:45:14.208 --> 01:45:16.835
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

01:45:18.421 --> 01:45:22.090
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

01:45:22.216 --> 01:45:25.927
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:30.015
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

01:45:31.266 --> 01:45:33.559
It was wonderful having her home.

01:45:34.895 --> 01:45:40.024
Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

01:45:40.108 --> 01:45:42.651
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:47.031
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.

01:45:47.115 --> 01:45:50.451
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

01:46:30.617 --> 01:46:33.827
How could you do this?

01:47:10.782 --> 01:47:14.118
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:20.833
I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:25.296
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

01:47:27.382 --> 01:47:31.719
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

01:47:33.221 --> 01:47:36.807
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

01:47:36.891 --> 01:47:39.727
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

01:47:44.733 --> 01:47:48.027
And she even showed me how to dance.

01:47:56.202 --> 01:48:00.413
And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.

01:48:04.168 --> 01:48:07.086
And it was the happiest time in my life.

01:48:26.732 --> 01:48:28.524
And this Fourth is
witnessing one of the

01:48:28.609 --> 01:48:31.611
largest fireworks displays
in the nation's...

01:48:31.695 --> 01:48:34.614
- You done watching it?
... here in New York Harbor...

01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:36.532
- I'm going to bed.
... with a spectacular display

01:48:36.617 --> 01:48:39.660
of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...

01:48:46.710 --> 01:48:48.711
Will you marry me?

01:48:53.634 --> 01:48:56.594
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

01:48:59.264 --> 01:49:01.307
You would, Forrest.

01:49:03.143 --> 01:49:05.478
But you won't marry me.

01:49:07.773 --> 01:49:09.982
You don't want to marry me.

01:49:13.570 --> 01:49:15.988
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

01:49:20.994 --> 01:49:23.121
I'm not a smart man,

01:49:24.832 --> 01:49:27.250
but I know what love is.

01:50:04.288 --> 01:50:05.538
Jenny.

01:50:07.458 --> 01:50:09.959
Forrest, I do love you.

01:51:03.095 --> 01:51:06.765
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

01:52:38.357 --> 01:52:43.695
That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.

01:52:44.864 --> 01:52:49.284
So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,

01:52:49.368 --> 01:52:51.119
I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.

01:52:51.203 --> 01:52:52.370
President Carter, suffering

01:52:52.455 --> 01:52:54.456
from heat exhaustion,
fell into the arms of...

01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.206
And when I got there,

01:52:56.291 --> 01:53:00.461
I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

01:53:00.545 --> 01:53:02.963
And I figured since I'd run this far,

01:53:03.048 --> 01:53:06.300
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

01:53:06.384 --> 01:53:07.593
And that's what I did.

01:53:08.219 --> 01:53:10.804
I ran clear across Alabama.

01:53:11.056 --> 01:53:14.224
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:17.144
I ran clear to the ocean.

01:53:23.026 --> 01:53:26.195
And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

01:53:26.738 --> 01:53:29.573
might as well turn around
and just keep on going.

01:53:33.328 --> 01:53:37.915
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:43.420
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

01:53:44.589 --> 01:53:49.426
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.

01:53:49.511 --> 01:53:52.554
When I had to go, you know...

01:53:54.182 --> 01:53:55.349
I went.

01:53:55.433 --> 01:53:58.435
And so, you just ran.

01:54:00.188 --> 01:54:01.271
Yeah.

01:54:36.558 --> 01:54:41.812
I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

01:54:42.814 --> 01:54:46.316
But most of all, I thought about Jenny.

01:54:47.402 --> 01:54:49.570
I thought about her a lot.

01:54:50.321 --> 01:54:53.407
For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,

01:54:53.491 --> 01:54:56.910
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

01:54:56.995 --> 01:54:59.163
has been running across America.

01:54:59.247 --> 01:55:01.248
Charles Cooper brings us this report.

01:55:02.167 --> 01:55:04.585
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,

01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:07.504
Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

01:55:07.630 --> 01:55:10.507
is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.

01:55:11.134 --> 01:55:13.177
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
- Sir, why are you running?

01:55:13.261 --> 01:55:14.344
Why are you running?

01:55:14.429 --> 01:55:16.013
Are you doing this for world peace?

01:55:16.097 --> 01:55:17.431
Are you doing this for the homeless?

01:55:17.515 --> 01:55:20.517
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

01:55:20.602 --> 01:55:21.602
Or for animals?

01:55:21.686 --> 01:55:24.604
They just couldn't believe
that somebody would do all that running

01:55:24.688 --> 01:55:26.063
for no particular reason.

01:55:26.148 --> 01:55:28.107
Why are you doing this?

01:55:28.192 --> 01:55:33.196
I just felt like running.

01:55:33.322 --> 01:55:36.532
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

01:55:37.367 --> 01:55:42.497
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

01:55:42.664 --> 01:55:44.791
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

01:55:44.875 --> 01:55:46.709
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

01:55:46.835 --> 01:55:48.795
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

01:55:48.879 --> 01:55:52.965
"Here's somebody who has the answer. "
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

01:55:53.050 --> 01:55:54.884
So, I got company.

01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:02.558
And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:08.231
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

01:56:10.025 --> 01:56:13.402
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

01:56:14.238 --> 01:56:16.823
but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.

01:56:17.032 --> 01:56:20.284
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

01:56:20.369 --> 01:56:22.119
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

01:56:22.204 --> 01:56:23.955
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

01:56:24.039 --> 01:56:27.166
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

01:56:27.251 --> 01:56:29.168
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

01:56:29.253 --> 01:56:32.880
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

01:56:34.424 --> 01:56:37.093
- It happens.
- What, shit?

01:56:38.595 --> 01:56:40.555
Sometimes.

01:56:42.432 --> 01:56:45.101
And some years later,
I heard that that fellow

01:56:45.185 --> 01:56:47.019
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,

01:56:47.104 --> 01:56:50.106
and he made a lot of money off of it.

01:56:51.567 --> 01:56:53.776
Another time, I was running along,

01:56:53.902 --> 01:56:57.196
somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

01:56:57.281 --> 01:56:59.323
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

01:56:59.408 --> 01:57:02.368
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.

01:57:02.452 --> 01:57:05.955
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

01:57:10.794 --> 01:57:12.461
Have a nice day.

01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:15.214
Well, some years later,

01:57:15.299 --> 01:57:19.218
I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

01:57:19.303 --> 01:57:21.679
He made a lot of money off of it.

01:57:24.474 --> 01:57:28.895
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.

01:57:30.147 --> 01:57:31.314
My mama always said,

01:57:31.398 --> 01:57:35.818
"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on. "

01:57:37.487 --> 01:57:40.823
And I think that's what
my running was all about.

01:57:41.658 --> 01:57:45.661
I had run for three years, two months,

01:57:45.913 --> 01:57:48.247
14 days and 16 hours.

01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:06.264
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

01:58:17.693 --> 01:58:19.444
I'm pretty tired.

01:58:22.281 --> 01:58:24.324
Think I'll go home now.

01:58:42.885 --> 01:58:45.345
Now what are we supposed to do?

01:58:46.305 --> 01:58:50.558
And just like that,
my running days was over.

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.270
So, I went home to Alabama.

01:58:55.064 --> 01:58:58.942
Moments ago, at 2:25 p. m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...

01:59:00.987 --> 01:59:05.156
...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

01:59:05.658 --> 01:59:07.993
The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...

01:59:08.077 --> 01:59:10.036
I picked up the mail.

01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:14.666
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:19.004
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

01:59:19.088 --> 01:59:21.673
and that's what I'm doing here.

01:59:21.757 --> 01:59:24.342
She saw me on TV, running.

01:59:24.427 --> 01:59:28.680
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

01:59:28.764 --> 01:59:35.687
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

01:59:35.771 --> 01:59:39.441
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

01:59:39.567 --> 01:59:44.112
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

01:59:45.948 --> 01:59:48.283
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

01:59:51.287 --> 01:59:53.204
It was nice talking to you.

01:59:54.498 --> 01:59:57.125
I hope everything works out for you!

02:00:04.633 --> 02:00:06.301
Hey!

02:00:06.719 --> 02:00:08.386
Forrest!

02:00:08.637 --> 02:00:11.890
How you doing? Come in, come in!

02:00:11.974 --> 02:00:13.183
I got your letter.

02:00:13.267 --> 02:00:15.894
I was wondering about that.

02:00:17.438 --> 02:00:19.230
Is this your house?

02:00:19.315 --> 02:00:22.399
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

02:00:22.484 --> 02:00:26.195
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

02:00:33.078 --> 02:00:35.120
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

02:00:37.916 --> 02:00:43.337
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

02:00:43.463 --> 02:00:45.089
There you are.

02:00:46.674 --> 02:00:48.050
And this, I got you running.

02:00:51.012 --> 02:00:53.180
I ran a long way,

02:00:53.681 --> 02:00:55.516
for a long time.

02:00:57.727 --> 02:00:59.228
And there...

02:01:05.735 --> 02:01:09.196
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

02:01:11.699 --> 02:01:16.036
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

02:01:16.162 --> 02:01:21.416
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

02:01:23.086 --> 02:01:24.086
Yoo-hoo!

02:01:24.212 --> 02:01:25.838
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:01:26.047 --> 02:01:27.047
Hey, you.

02:01:28.216 --> 02:01:31.176
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

02:01:31.261 --> 02:01:34.346
Listen, next week my schedule
changes, so I'll be able to... But thanks...

02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:36.473
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

02:01:36.558 --> 02:01:38.433
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

02:01:41.896 --> 02:01:44.648
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

02:01:44.732 --> 02:01:47.818
- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

02:01:47.902 --> 02:01:50.904
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

02:01:53.741 --> 02:01:57.077
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

02:01:59.956 --> 02:02:01.790
His name's Forrest.

02:02:02.917 --> 02:02:04.251
Like me.

02:02:05.879 --> 02:02:08.005
I named him after his daddy.

02:02:08.965 --> 02:02:11.425
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

02:02:12.719 --> 02:02:14.761
You're his daddy, Forrest.

02:02:29.235 --> 02:02:30.444
Hey.

02:02:31.613 --> 02:02:34.489
Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.

02:02:37.076 --> 02:02:41.205
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

02:02:41.748 --> 02:02:43.123
Okay?

02:02:47.462 --> 02:02:49.337
Isn't he beautiful?

02:02:50.339 --> 02:02:53.299
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

02:02:57.095 --> 02:02:58.179
But...

02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:04.727
Is he smart, or...

02:03:04.811 --> 02:03:08.814
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

02:03:18.158 --> 02:03:20.618
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

02:03:29.962 --> 02:03:32.797
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

02:03:55.904 --> 02:03:57.697
Forrest,

02:03:59.157 --> 02:04:00.700
I'm sick.

02:04:03.370 --> 02:04:06.998
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

02:04:07.082 --> 02:04:09.458
I have some kind of virus,

02:04:09.543 --> 02:04:12.253
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

02:04:12.379 --> 02:04:15.381
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

02:04:19.761 --> 02:04:22.054
You could come home with me.

02:04:23.724 --> 02:04:29.395
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

02:04:33.734 --> 02:04:36.527
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

02:04:38.905 --> 02:04:41.198
Would you marry me, Forrest?

02:04:46.455 --> 02:04:47.705
Okay.

02:04:48.749 --> 02:04:50.416
Please take your seats.

02:04:54.254 --> 02:04:56.589
Forrest? It's time to start.

02:05:15.984 --> 02:05:17.567
Hi.

02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:19.944
Your tie.

02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:51.434
Lieutenant Dan.

02:05:52.269 --> 02:05:53.937
Hello, Forrest.

02:05:54.605 --> 02:05:57.273
You got new legs. New legs!

02:05:58.484 --> 02:06:02.278
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

02:06:02.988 --> 02:06:06.991
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:12.330
Magic legs.

02:06:14.333 --> 02:06:18.711
This is my fiancée, Susan.

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:24.884
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

02:06:26.971 --> 02:06:30.181
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

02:06:30.558 --> 02:06:33.560
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:47.866
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

02:06:49.743 --> 02:06:53.997
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

02:06:55.332 --> 02:06:58.710
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

02:07:29.575 --> 02:07:31.451
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:07:45.132 --> 02:07:46.924
Hey, Forrest.

02:07:52.263 --> 02:07:54.056
Were you scared in Vietnam?

02:07:55.725 --> 02:07:58.060
Yes. Well, I...

02:07:59.395 --> 02:08:01.104
I don't know.

02:08:01.814 --> 02:08:06.777
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

02:08:09.906 --> 02:08:11.949
And then it was nice.

02:08:15.328 --> 02:08:19.289
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

02:08:20.583 --> 02:08:24.461
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

02:08:26.256 --> 02:08:30.175
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

02:08:30.301 --> 02:08:34.888
it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.

02:08:37.433 --> 02:08:40.477
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

02:08:42.939 --> 02:08:47.109
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped

02:08:47.652 --> 02:08:50.028
and the earth began.

02:08:51.281 --> 02:08:53.156
It was so beautiful.

02:08:57.870 --> 02:09:00.956
I wish I could've been there with you.

02:09:04.043 --> 02:09:05.460
You were.

02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:17.639
I love you.

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:25.355
You died on a Saturday morning.

02:09:27.066 --> 02:09:30.819
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:40.537
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

02:09:44.667 --> 02:09:46.335
Mama

02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:52.424
always said that dying was a part of life.

02:09:55.845 --> 02:09:58.180
I sure wish it wasn't.

02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:04.603
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

02:10:05.938 --> 02:10:07.022
But...

02:10:07.273 --> 02:10:09.941
About to start school again soon,

02:10:11.778 --> 02:10:15.571
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

02:10:17.741 --> 02:10:23.746
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

02:10:26.875 --> 02:10:29.460
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

02:10:30.754 --> 02:10:31.796
Okay.

02:10:32.047 --> 02:10:33.214
He's really good.

02:10:33.298 --> 02:10:35.424
Forrest, you go.

02:10:39.638 --> 02:10:41.222
We fish a lot.

02:10:44.768 --> 02:10:48.229
And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

02:10:51.483 --> 02:10:53.734
You'd be so proud of him.

02:10:55.445 --> 02:10:56.904
I am.

02:10:57.948 --> 02:11:01.158
He wrote you a letter.

02:11:02.744 --> 02:11:04.787
And he says I can't read it.

02:11:04.913 --> 02:11:08.457
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

02:11:24.516 --> 02:11:25.850
Jenny,

02:11:31.648 --> 02:11:34.859
I don't know if Mama was right,

02:11:36.194 --> 02:11:37.695
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

02:11:37.821 --> 02:11:40.406
I don't know

02:11:40.490 --> 02:11:44.994
if we each have a destiny,

02:11:47.038 --> 02:11:52.168
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

02:11:56.673 --> 02:11:58.507
But I think

02:12:00.385 --> 02:12:02.178
maybe it's both.

02:12:06.516 --> 02:12:09.393
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

02:12:15.525 --> 02:12:17.526
But I miss you, Jenny.

02:12:23.909 --> 02:12:28.329
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

02:13:03.614 --> 02:13:06.574
Here's your bus. Okay.

02:13:08.244 --> 02:13:11.579
Hey. I know this.

02:13:11.705 --> 02:13:14.582
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

02:13:14.708 --> 02:13:17.377
Grandma used to read it to you.

02:13:17.461 --> 02:13:19.587
My favorite book.

02:13:22.925 --> 02:13:24.425
Here we are.

02:13:24.593 --> 02:13:26.052
Okay.

02:13:27.763 --> 02:13:29.264
Here you go.

02:13:34.144 --> 02:13:36.646
Hey, Forrest, don't...

02:13:40.109 --> 02:13:43.820
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

02:13:45.823 --> 02:13:48.616
I'll be right here when you get back.

02:13:53.163 --> 02:13:56.416
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

02:13:56.500 --> 02:14:00.044
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
