WEBVTT

00:04.896 --> 00:07.888
All right, here we go.
Next bucket wins.

00:07.913 --> 00:09.121
Check.

00:10.419 --> 00:13.872
All right, hold on. I
gotta tie my shoe.

00:15.104 --> 00:16.471
So, how are you and Natalie doing?

00:16.505 --> 00:18.245
I see what you're doing.
It's not gonna work.

00:18.270 --> 00:19.395
Seriously.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.567
I just wanted to see if you
two are getting along.

00:20.592 --> 00:22.191
Seriously, things have
never been better.

00:22.216 --> 00:24.699
I'm a lucky guy. Now quit stalling.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.358
Well, I'm glad you
didn't screw things up.

00:26.448 --> 00:28.256
'cause you can be a real knucklehead.

00:28.281 --> 00:30.414
What's that supposed to mean?

00:31.651 --> 00:32.794
Yes!

00:34.588 --> 00:36.286
Ethan, this way.

00:36.544 --> 00:37.963
What the hell happened?

00:37.988 --> 00:40.583
Uh, this guy, I think he OD'd.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.098
- You should've called 911.
- Look around.

00:43.123 --> 00:45.591
Last thing I wanna do is
get anyone in trouble.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.815
Em, it's 7:00 a.m. What
are you even doing here?

00:49.840 --> 00:51.257
I was out dancing with my friends.

00:51.282 --> 00:53.629
- Got invited over here after.
- Don't you have work today?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.829
Ethan, don't worry, I'll be there.

00:55.854 --> 00:57.634
Over here.

00:57.659 --> 00:58.605
His name's Jeremy.

00:58.630 --> 01:01.363
Jeremy? Hey, Jeremy...

01:01.388 --> 01:03.043
what did you take, huh?

01:03.068 --> 01:04.668
Does anyone know what he took?

01:06.632 --> 01:08.657
Heroin. He's choking.

01:08.682 --> 01:10.665
Oh, God.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.272
I can't clear it.

01:15.297 --> 01:17.572
- Em, see if you can find a pen.
- What? Why?

01:17.604 --> 01:19.638
He's not breathing. He
needs a surgical airway.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074

01:31.554 --> 01:33.553
- Hey!
- Here, got one.

01:33.578 --> 01:35.344
Unscrew the top.

01:40.242 --> 01:41.501
I'm in.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.260
He's breathing.

01:52.736 --> 01:56.059
- Unfortunately,
I have to bring up

01:56.084 --> 01:58.736
last week's mass casualty incident,

01:58.761 --> 02:00.786
because in the chaos,

02:00.811 --> 02:03.346
it seems 40 pills of Percocet

02:03.371 --> 02:06.140
disappeared from the
medication dispensary.

02:06.165 --> 02:08.197
That's a street value of $2,500.

02:08.222 --> 02:10.989
Someone took advantage
of that situation.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.927
So, we will be
implementing new protocols

02:13.952 --> 02:17.020
to prevent that from
happening in the future.

02:18.625 --> 02:20.973
Keep your eye out for a
memo in the next few days.

02:20.998 --> 02:22.665
Any questions?

02:22.955 --> 02:25.856
Good. Back to work.

02:46.053 --> 02:48.689
_

02:54.761 --> 02:56.969
Go to Four.

02:56.994 --> 02:58.466
Tracy Herman, 25-year-old female.

02:58.491 --> 03:01.756
21 weeks pregnant. GCS, 14, dyspneic.

03:01.781 --> 03:02.926
This is her mother, Pam.

03:02.951 --> 03:05.374
- Is my baby okay?
- We're gonna take a look.

03:05.399 --> 03:06.866
All right, Tracy, I'm Dr. Manning.

03:06.891 --> 03:08.625
- Can you tell me what happened?
- I don't know.

03:08.650 --> 03:11.267
We were having breakfast
and she just collapsed.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.776
All right, let's transfer her
and put her on the monitors.

03:13.801 --> 03:16.808
On my count, ready, one, two, three.

03:18.717 --> 03:20.405
Any pain or discomfort?

03:20.430 --> 03:21.807
No.

03:26.261 --> 03:28.408
Breath sounds are clear
and present bilaterally,

03:28.433 --> 03:30.132
but I am hearing a systolic murmur.

03:30.157 --> 03:31.169
What does that mean?

03:31.194 --> 03:34.035
It's probably the pregnancy
putting a strain on your heart.

03:34.060 --> 03:36.824
- Have you had any bleeding?
- Uh, just some spotting,

03:36.849 --> 03:39.450
- but my OB said it's normal.
- It can be.

03:39.475 --> 03:41.248
Uh, Doris, let's get
a fetal ultrasound,

03:41.273 --> 03:44.337
uh, chest X-ray, and call up to
Cardiology for an ECHO, okay?

03:44.655 --> 03:46.946
All right, Tracy, just try to relax.

03:46.971 --> 03:48.607
All right, we're gonna
do everything we can

03:48.632 --> 03:50.330
to figure this out, all right?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.042
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.789
Oh, goodie.

03:59.922 --> 04:01.772
Lime flavor today.

04:01.797 --> 04:04.099
I, uh, just checked
with the charge nurse.

04:04.151 --> 04:06.159
Your last set of labs look good.

04:06.468 --> 04:08.211
If everything holds for
the next 24 hours,

04:08.236 --> 04:10.004
they'll put you back on solid foods.

04:10.052 --> 04:12.604
Whoo. Wonderful news.

04:12.629 --> 04:14.563
I also told her about your nausea.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.767
She'll be over in a few minutes
with some ondansetron.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.207
Sarah?

04:21.075 --> 04:23.634
I know I haven't said it enough, but...

04:24.710 --> 04:26.049
thank you.

04:26.074 --> 04:28.486
I can't tell you how grateful I am

04:28.511 --> 04:31.411
for all you've done for
me since the transplant.

04:32.206 --> 04:35.403
No, just, uh, one more thing.

04:35.728 --> 04:39.674
It looks like I'll still
be in rehab for a while.

04:40.148 --> 04:42.083
Uh, I haven't checked my mail

04:42.108 --> 04:44.275
since all this happened.

04:44.328 --> 04:46.801
I'm sure the bills are piling up.

04:47.249 --> 04:49.132
You want me to run to your apartment?

04:50.065 --> 04:52.667
Unfortunately, I have
no one else to ask.

04:56.319 --> 04:58.892
All right, but it'll have
to wait a few hours.

04:58.981 --> 05:01.016
Dr. Charles and I have
rounds at Cohn County.

05:01.041 --> 05:01.817
The jail?

05:01.842 --> 05:05.019
Ooh, sounds fascinating.

05:05.154 --> 05:07.630
All right.

05:07.655 --> 05:11.318
Now, this certainly
can wait till after.

05:11.588 --> 05:14.850
It's this key right here.

05:15.409 --> 05:19.450
I made a short list of things I need.

05:19.475 --> 05:22.317
If you don't mind.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.830
"No clues to mystery surrounding

05:27.855 --> 05:29.734
"missing college co-eds

05:29.759 --> 05:32.517
Search for Indiana girl goes on."

05:32.542 --> 05:34.231
This poor young lady, Olivia Coveny,

05:34.256 --> 05:37.099
seems to have disappeared
from the Madison campus,

05:37.124 --> 05:38.785
what, about ten years ago?

05:38.810 --> 05:40.950
"Wisconsin girl missing."

05:41.439 --> 05:43.193
What am I looking at?

05:43.218 --> 05:44.766
Seems like somebody is
trying to make a case

05:44.791 --> 05:48.224
that Robert Haywood is a very bad guy.

05:48.249 --> 05:50.350
- Sarah Reese's father?
- Yeah.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.841
Well, I mean, apparently,
he was a visiting lecturer

05:52.866 --> 05:55.252
at all of these colleges

05:55.277 --> 05:58.122
at the same time that
these women disappeared.

05:58.147 --> 06:00.191
And you don't know who sent you this?

06:00.216 --> 06:02.122
Nope. Somebody slipped
it under my door.

06:02.147 --> 06:02.970
Apparently, somebody knows

06:02.995 --> 06:04.341
that I'm working with Robert Haywood.

06:04.366 --> 06:06.448
I think if you think
there's something there,

06:06.668 --> 06:08.719
you should turn it over to the police.

06:08.744 --> 06:09.898
Turn what over to the police?

06:09.923 --> 06:11.501
It's all completely circumstantial.

06:11.526 --> 06:12.864
There's nothing in
here that connects him

06:12.889 --> 06:14.206
to any one of these women.

06:14.231 --> 06:16.360
And if you read the articles,
every single one of these cases

06:16.385 --> 06:18.614
has been thoroughly
investigated by the police.

06:19.015 --> 06:21.967
You haven't shared this with Dr.
Reese yet, have you?

06:22.128 --> 06:23.706
Absolutely not.

06:26.878 --> 06:28.413
We set up Baghdad as
soon as you called.

06:28.438 --> 06:29.544
- How's he doing?
- Got an ET tube in

06:29.569 --> 06:31.075
on the right, but held
off on the naloxone.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.531
They don't want him waking
up with a tube in his neck.

06:32.556 --> 06:33.860
But he needs a better airway.

06:33.885 --> 06:35.254
Get me a number eight trach tube.

06:35.279 --> 06:37.661
You ready to get him on the monitors?

06:37.946 --> 06:40.455
All right, we're gonna
transfer him on my count.

06:40.755 --> 06:43.249
Everybody ready? One, two, three.

06:52.447 --> 06:53.745
I'm in. Bag him.

06:56.478 --> 06:58.526
BP's dropping. 88 over 50.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.956
All right, he's still intoxicated.

06:59.981 --> 07:01.551
We need to reverse him.

07:01.576 --> 07:03.653
Push 2 milligrams of naloxone IV.

07:14.394 --> 07:15.827
How's Jeremy?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.799
It's gonna take time for the
drugs to clear from his system,

07:17.824 --> 07:19.188
but he should be okay.

07:21.962 --> 07:23.771
I'm gonna go home and change.

07:23.796 --> 07:26.107
I'll be back for work
in a couple of hours.

07:29.513 --> 07:31.009
Heroin?

07:31.034 --> 07:33.443
What was she thinking,
going to that party?

07:34.271 --> 07:36.455
I'm not sure she was thinking.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.501
Hey. How was the game?

07:43.070 --> 07:45.281
I'm filing a protest with
the league commissioner.

07:45.306 --> 07:46.925
So you lost?

07:46.950 --> 07:48.872
- Dr. Manning?
- Yes?

07:48.897 --> 07:50.258
Imaging results from
your pregnant patient

07:50.283 --> 07:51.907
in Treatment Four.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.486
- You better page CT surgery.
- Yeah.

07:55.511 --> 07:57.163
- Maggie?
- Yeah?

07:57.188 --> 07:58.607
Okay.

07:59.102 --> 08:01.687
Now, the access to the
atria of both hearts.

08:01.712 --> 08:03.633
We're ready to clamp.

08:04.323 --> 08:06.046
Left is clamped.

08:09.283 --> 08:10.583
And the right...

08:10.608 --> 08:12.608
Dr. Bekker will now
perform the separation.

08:12.633 --> 08:13.399
Scalpel.

08:13.424 --> 08:15.354
Josh, have peeds surgery ready.

08:16.970 --> 08:19.077
- What's happening?
- Heart rate's diving.

08:19.102 --> 08:21.029
- The twins are bradying down.
- Dr. Bekker?

08:21.054 --> 08:22.658
I don't know, my incision
was superficial.

08:22.683 --> 08:25.772
- Step aside.
- Heart rate's down to 44.

08:25.797 --> 08:26.944
There's no bleeding.

08:26.969 --> 08:28.694
We haven't cut near any major vessels.

08:28.719 --> 08:30.086
We need to push atropine.

08:30.111 --> 08:32.198
No, it's too late.

08:35.577 --> 08:37.578
Congratulations, Dr. Latham.

08:37.602 --> 08:39.386
According to the computer simulation,

08:39.412 --> 08:40.893
your team just killed both twins.

08:40.918 --> 08:43.397
- Yes, we did.
- I don't know what happened.

08:43.422 --> 08:46.114
That's why we conduct these
exercises, Dr. Bekker,

08:46.139 --> 08:48.022
so that we can predict all outcomes

08:48.047 --> 08:50.281
and make the necessary
adjustments on game day.

08:50.306 --> 08:52.255
Dr. Frisch, my team will
evaluate our approach

08:52.280 --> 08:53.747
and determine what went wrong.

08:53.772 --> 08:55.272
We'll gather again this afternoon

08:55.297 --> 08:57.135
and resume the procedure.

08:58.883 --> 09:00.470
I'd like all possible scenarios

09:00.495 --> 09:02.296
on my desk before lunch.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.998
Yes, Dr. Latham.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.688
Keep your chin up.
You'll figure it out.

09:09.024 --> 09:10.825
You know, you don't have to do that.

09:10.859 --> 09:11.959
What?

09:11.993 --> 09:14.595
Act like you don't enjoy
seeing me on the hot seat.

09:14.629 --> 09:15.896
Go ahead and buy it.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.299
If I were in your position, I would.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.895
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Bekker,
they need you in the ED.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.640
Okay.

09:22.848 --> 09:25.115
You're saying I have
damage to my heart?

09:25.140 --> 09:27.557
Uh, to be specific,
it's your mitrovalve.

09:27.582 --> 09:29.385
Uh, when it's not functioning properly,

09:29.410 --> 09:31.622
the body doesn't get enough oxygen.

09:31.647 --> 09:33.562
Which is why you've
been feeling so weak

09:33.587 --> 09:35.214
and short of breath.

09:35.247 --> 09:38.282
But she's never had any
problems with her heart before.

09:38.309 --> 09:41.044
In all likelihood, Tracy
was born with a defect,

09:41.078 --> 09:43.822
and it just didn't show
any symptoms until now.

09:43.847 --> 09:46.849
Um, the baby has apparently
added strain to your heart,

09:46.874 --> 09:48.824
which has caused it to present itself.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.352
We'll need surgery to replace
the defective valve.

09:51.377 --> 09:53.471
Oh...

09:55.283 --> 09:57.050
Okay.

09:58.606 --> 10:01.989
There are... potential complications.

10:02.023 --> 10:03.991
Complications?

10:06.127 --> 10:07.461
Due to your pregnancy,

10:07.495 --> 10:09.512
the medication needed
to conduct the surgery

10:09.537 --> 10:12.934
could cause a life
threatening vaginal bleed,

10:13.535 --> 10:17.204
and given that your fetus
hasn't reached viability...

10:17.238 --> 10:19.294
Wh... what are you saying?

10:19.630 --> 10:21.567
We think it's best for your
health if you terminate

10:21.592 --> 10:23.386
before undergoing surgery.

10:23.411 --> 10:26.357
What? No.

10:26.382 --> 10:28.149
You don't understand.

10:28.183 --> 10:30.218
Her husband, Roy...

10:30.478 --> 10:33.465
we lost him in a car
accident three months ago.

10:37.757 --> 10:40.295
We had just got the news
that I was pregnant.

10:42.527 --> 10:44.186
He was so excited.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.021
He wanted this so bad.

10:46.842 --> 10:48.824
Tracy, trust me,

10:49.336 --> 10:51.559
I understand what you're going through,

10:51.680 --> 10:53.681
but without this surgery,

10:53.706 --> 10:56.578
neither you nor your baby will survive.

10:58.711 --> 11:02.053
Honey, please... listen to the doctors.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.814
No. No!

11:04.317 --> 11:06.084
This baby is all I have left.

11:08.141 --> 11:10.072
I won't let you take it from me.

11:19.208 --> 11:22.242
The patient understands
that, without surgery,

11:22.267 --> 11:25.160
- condition could be fatal?
- Yeah, we explained the risks.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.400
Well, so, your concerns
are certainly justified.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.365
We need blood thinners to keep
the bypass pump for clotting.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.824
Hm. Have you considered

11:31.858 --> 11:33.745
a minimally invasive valvuloplasty?

11:33.770 --> 11:36.083
Yes, but due to the level of stenosis

11:36.108 --> 11:38.471
and the presence of regurgitation,

11:38.496 --> 11:40.201
we don't feel that she's a candidate.

11:40.226 --> 11:41.493
We have to open her chest.

11:41.518 --> 11:42.891
What if there is another option?

11:42.916 --> 11:44.065
What?

11:44.090 --> 11:45.940
If we lower the dose
of the blood thinners

11:45.965 --> 11:47.926
and use a heparin-coated bypass tube,

11:47.951 --> 11:50.452
there is a chance that we
could save both mom and baby.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.878
According to Dr. Manning,

11:51.903 --> 11:54.341
Tracy's Level Two ultrasound
showed placenta previa,

11:54.366 --> 11:55.739
which puts her at an even greater risk

11:55.764 --> 11:57.447
of developing a serious bleed.

11:57.472 --> 11:59.440
Ava, you heard what she said.

11:59.622 --> 12:02.224
This baby is all she has
left of her dead husband.

12:02.249 --> 12:04.949
Don't we have an obligation to
honor the patient's wishes?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.880
So, we should let the patient's
emotional involvement

12:06.905 --> 12:08.395
impact our medical decisions?

12:08.420 --> 12:10.645
I think we owe it to her
to give it a shot, yes.

12:11.151 --> 12:12.801
With close monitoring, it is possible

12:12.826 --> 12:14.287
to stay ahead of any bleeding.

12:14.663 --> 12:15.963
Dr. Rhodes, if you believe

12:15.988 --> 12:17.479
that this is the best course of action,

12:17.504 --> 12:19.560
- please proceed.
- Thank you.

12:23.791 --> 12:26.526
Well... good luck.

12:37.731 --> 12:39.405
Are you taking her up to surgery?

12:39.430 --> 12:42.065
Yeah. I'm worried about her.

12:42.090 --> 12:44.089
Connor's taking a big risk.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.401
Hey, you two, Treatment Six.

12:47.426 --> 12:49.127
Okay.

12:53.409 --> 12:55.007
Hi.

12:55.032 --> 12:57.199
You must be Cody.

12:57.224 --> 12:59.259
- What's his temp?
- 102.

12:59.284 --> 13:01.244
He's been like this for over a week.

13:01.269 --> 13:04.596
Uh, I've had him on
Tamiflu, bed rest, fluids.

13:04.621 --> 13:06.014
We've tried everything.

13:06.039 --> 13:07.251
He... he just keeps getting worse.

13:07.276 --> 13:09.474
It's been an... an extremely
harsh flu season.

13:09.499 --> 13:10.832
Is anyone else in your household sick?

13:10.857 --> 13:12.299
No, it's just the two of us.

13:12.324 --> 13:13.625
I've been spared so far,

13:13.650 --> 13:15.402
I-I assume 'cause I was vaccinated.

13:15.427 --> 13:16.924
And what about Cody?

13:16.949 --> 13:18.750
Uh, unfortunately not.

13:18.858 --> 13:20.420
No, I-I know what you're thinking.

13:20.445 --> 13:21.917
It's not like that.

13:21.942 --> 13:23.635
Uh, Cody has a... A
long list of allergies.

13:23.660 --> 13:26.040
Last year, he had a severe
reaction to the vaccine.

13:26.065 --> 13:28.817
I-I didn't wanna put him
through that again, you know?

13:28.842 --> 13:30.192
I understand, all right.

13:30.217 --> 13:32.514
It makes sense why you didn't
wanna get him vaccinated.

13:32.769 --> 13:35.616
Let's get a CBC, CMP, and
a chest X-ray, okay?

13:35.893 --> 13:37.664
I promise we're gonna
do everything we can

13:37.689 --> 13:39.538
to take care of your son, okay?

13:39.563 --> 13:41.673
We'll be back soon.

13:43.201 --> 13:45.536
All right... couple of more seconds

13:45.561 --> 13:47.306
and I'll have the valve free.

13:49.755 --> 13:51.890
No evidence of bleeding.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.549
Good.

13:53.757 --> 13:55.958
There. Got it.

13:58.956 --> 14:01.296
All right, let's get a sizing tool.

14:01.321 --> 14:02.390
I'm gonna measure the opening,

14:02.415 --> 14:04.161
determine what size valve we need.

14:04.236 --> 14:06.838
Let's start with a 21.

14:13.731 --> 14:16.700
Yep. Let's open a
21-millimeter porcine valve.

14:16.734 --> 14:18.214
Manufacturer had some production delays

14:18.239 --> 14:20.563
with that size valve.
It's on backorder.

14:20.588 --> 14:21.730
But I have a mechanical.

14:21.755 --> 14:23.783
Can we get one from another supplier?

14:23.808 --> 14:25.168
Sure, but it'll take an hour or more

14:25.193 --> 14:27.224
- for a rep to get here.
- Marty?

14:27.249 --> 14:28.985
With any other patient, maybe,

14:29.010 --> 14:30.439
but every minute this woman's on pump

14:30.464 --> 14:32.908
reduces her chances of
maintaining this pregnancy.

14:36.862 --> 14:38.666
Okay, then let's open
the mechanical valve.

14:38.691 --> 14:40.876
Mechanical valve means she'll
need heparin post-operatively.

14:40.901 --> 14:42.271
She'll be more likely to bleed.

14:42.555 --> 14:44.546
- We need to wait for a porcine.
- You heard what Marty said.

14:44.571 --> 14:46.186
This baby doesn't have an hour.

14:46.211 --> 14:47.574
We don't have a choice.

14:57.777 --> 15:00.378
Thank you again for stopping.
It saves me so much time.

15:00.413 --> 15:02.693
Right on the way back from Cohn County.
Pretty easy.

15:02.718 --> 15:04.263
I'll only be a couple of minutes.

15:04.288 --> 15:06.645
You know, it's a pretty hefty
list your dad left for you.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.245
Are you sure you don't want some help?

15:08.283 --> 15:10.712
Do you mind? In case I can't
fit it all in one box?

15:10.737 --> 15:13.513
Not at all.

15:27.016 --> 15:28.417
I'll go pack some clothes.

15:28.576 --> 15:30.649
He said he wanted a book or two?

15:30.674 --> 15:33.501
Yeah, I think his office
is down the hall.

16:10.972 --> 16:13.821
- Dr. Charles, you ready?
- Yeah.

16:13.846 --> 16:15.741
Do you have a book?

16:15.966 --> 16:18.327
Right over here.

16:35.344 --> 16:37.212
You made it... on time.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.555
Don't act so surprised.

16:40.505 --> 16:42.005
How's he doing?

16:42.148 --> 16:44.239
Stable for the moment.

16:46.057 --> 16:48.125
Uh... listen,

16:48.159 --> 16:50.761
about this morning...

16:50.795 --> 16:52.863
thanks for being there.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.940
- Yeah.
- Guess I better get to work.

16:58.429 --> 17:00.330
I'll check in later.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.125
You hear about the missing Percocet?

17:07.159 --> 17:09.800
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
It was a chaotic day.

17:10.334 --> 17:13.104
You know, I hate to even
mention this, but...

17:13.407 --> 17:15.175
you don't think Emily could've had

17:15.200 --> 17:16.451
something to do with it, do you?

17:16.476 --> 17:17.811
What?

17:17.837 --> 17:20.867
She was working that
day, she had access,

17:20.893 --> 17:23.194
and now her friend OD's at a party?

17:23.347 --> 17:25.781
And how'd she afford
those new Louboutins?

17:25.817 --> 17:28.117
- Lou... Loubout... what?
- The shoes she had on.

17:28.152 --> 17:29.653
Do you know how expensive they are?

17:29.687 --> 17:31.154
April, you're the one
that keeps telling me

17:31.189 --> 17:32.471
to give her a chance.

17:32.496 --> 17:35.298
Did Emily show poor judgment
this morning? Absolutely.

17:35.733 --> 17:38.624
But this kid OD'd on
heroin, not Percocet.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.102
Is there something else
about Emily I'm missing?

17:42.280 --> 17:45.068
No, uh... I'm sorry.

17:45.103 --> 17:46.936
Forget I mentioned it.

17:46.961 --> 17:48.261
Okay.

17:50.551 --> 17:51.991
So, get this,

17:52.016 --> 17:54.780
it turns out that
Robert Haywood did know

17:54.805 --> 17:56.873
one of those co-eds that disappeared:

17:56.898 --> 17:58.459
- Olivia Coveny.
- Oh, yeah?

17:58.484 --> 18:00.818
The one from Madison,
yeah, was his student.

18:00.944 --> 18:02.719
And I saw a picture of 'em
together this morning

18:02.744 --> 18:04.301
at his apartment.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.307
Wait a minute,

18:06.332 --> 18:09.167
you... you went to his apartment?

18:09.360 --> 18:11.400
Sarah and I were doing rounds
at the jail this morning,

18:11.425 --> 18:13.326
and she needed to pick
up some of this stuff,

18:13.351 --> 18:15.502
and so we just stopped on the way back.

18:15.527 --> 18:16.951
But what happened to,

18:16.976 --> 18:18.891
"We're gonna forget all about it"?

18:18.916 --> 18:19.593
She asked for my help.

18:19.618 --> 18:21.094
What am I supposed to
do, sit in the car?

18:21.119 --> 18:23.068
And I couldn't help, seeing
the picture was right there.

18:23.093 --> 18:24.491
And, by the way, part of me says,

18:24.516 --> 18:25.892
"So they knew each other. So what?

18:25.917 --> 18:27.689
Student, you know, teacher."

18:27.714 --> 18:29.911
But the thing is is
that in the picture,

18:29.936 --> 18:31.503
he had his arm around her.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.067
Well, have you considered calling

18:33.092 --> 18:35.628
t-he Madison Police Department?
No, I did.

18:35.653 --> 18:37.453
The detective I talked to,

18:37.725 --> 18:39.480
I don't know, he just didn't
seem that interested.

18:39.505 --> 18:41.668
You know, ten years ago,
it was a cold case.

18:41.693 --> 18:42.962
Mm.

18:42.987 --> 18:45.601
If I only had, like, two more
minutes in that apartment.

18:45.626 --> 18:47.933
- Daniel...
- What?

18:48.019 --> 18:49.966
Be careful.

18:55.055 --> 18:57.150
- Sats are dropping.
- What's happening?

18:57.175 --> 18:59.405
- Respiratory failure.
- Bag him.

18:59.667 --> 19:02.862
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
We need to intubate now.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.086
Sats are down to 87.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.213
- Nat...
- I'm almost there.

19:20.762 --> 19:23.840
- Oh, God...
- 82.

19:23.865 --> 19:24.999
I'm in.

19:25.024 --> 19:26.515
Now, let's get 10 parts per million

19:26.540 --> 19:28.138
of inhaled nitric oxide.

19:28.179 --> 19:30.530
Let's get a chest X-ray
for tube placement.

19:45.538 --> 19:47.271
Dad?

19:47.501 --> 19:49.268
Oh, Sarah.

19:51.343 --> 19:53.611
She's even lovelier than you said.

19:59.317 --> 20:00.960
Thank you.

20:02.312 --> 20:04.947
I should probably get going,

20:04.972 --> 20:06.773
but, um...

20:06.798 --> 20:08.913
thank you, Robert.

20:09.415 --> 20:11.663
This has meant so much to me.

20:12.731 --> 20:14.499
As to me.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.806
What was that all about?

20:21.988 --> 20:24.775
That... was the widow

20:24.800 --> 20:26.448
of my heart donor.

20:26.473 --> 20:28.611
She had asked to meet me.

20:28.636 --> 20:31.526
I admit I was reticent
about the whole thing,

20:31.551 --> 20:33.886
but, surprisingly...

20:35.014 --> 20:36.668
it felt good.

20:44.392 --> 20:47.362
- Sats are still in the tank.
- Nitric oxide didn't work.

20:47.387 --> 20:49.311
Neither did low volume ventilation.

20:49.336 --> 20:50.470
Where's the mom?

20:50.495 --> 20:52.140
She went to grab a cup of coffee.

20:52.165 --> 20:53.746
We should get him up to the PICU.

20:53.771 --> 20:54.627
I called already.

20:54.652 --> 20:56.557
They don't have an
isolation room available.

20:56.582 --> 20:59.226
This flu epidemic is wreaking havoc.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.442
It's time to consider ECMO.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.155
Yeah.

21:03.539 --> 21:06.594
Hey, uh, what do you think of this?

21:07.646 --> 21:09.550
- A rash?
- Mm-hmm.

21:09.632 --> 21:11.266
It's not abnormal.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.661
I'll call the ICU, see if
they have an extra iso room.

21:13.686 --> 21:15.353
Thanks.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.252
Dr. Choi, we need you.

21:22.452 --> 21:25.093
- He's having a seizure.
- Push 2 of Ativan.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.153
All right, take it easy, take it easy.

21:27.178 --> 21:28.256
His eyes are icteric.

21:28.281 --> 21:29.983
There's something wrong with his liver.

21:30.008 --> 21:31.275
From the heroin?

21:31.300 --> 21:33.242
Not likely. Did we get his labs back?

21:33.267 --> 21:35.106
I think they came in a few minutes ago.

21:35.131 --> 21:36.676
Okay.

21:42.746 --> 21:45.427
Positive for acetaminophen.
That's in Percocet.

21:45.452 --> 21:48.072
Uh, let's also start a NAC,
140 milligrams per kilogram.

21:48.097 --> 21:49.339
Okay.

21:59.057 --> 22:01.172
April, what you said about
the missing drugs...

22:01.197 --> 22:02.980
Oh, forget it, I shouldn't
have gone there.

22:03.005 --> 22:04.812
Actually, you should've.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.487
I thought this kid OD'd on heroin,

22:07.512 --> 22:08.874
but his labs came back positive

22:08.899 --> 22:10.758
for both opioids and acetaminophen.

22:11.253 --> 22:13.712
I can't tell it's exactly
what he took, but...

22:14.223 --> 22:16.734
the most likely source is
Percocet, our missing drug.

22:17.028 --> 22:19.447
You thought from the beginning
this could be a possibility.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.631
- Why?
- I don't know.

22:20.656 --> 22:23.531
Maybe what you've told
me about her history.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.844
April, what aren't you telling me?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.749
Remember that first day Emily
came to stay with you?

22:30.774 --> 22:32.104
Yeah.

22:32.129 --> 22:34.143
She cleaned up and cooked dinner.

22:34.443 --> 22:36.611
She also had some people over.

22:36.636 --> 22:38.132
I found an ash tray

22:38.157 --> 22:40.378
full of cigarette butts
in the bathroom.

22:40.403 --> 22:41.853
You didn't think I should know?

22:41.878 --> 22:45.145
I just... I wanted you two to
get off on the right foot.

22:45.170 --> 22:47.493
She begged me not to say anything.

22:48.235 --> 22:50.723
I'm sorry. I should've told you.

22:51.642 --> 22:53.391
Yeah.

22:53.416 --> 22:56.143
I'm gonna go talk to her. Maybe
she'll come clean to me.

22:56.168 --> 22:57.503
No.

22:57.528 --> 22:59.162
She's my sister. I'll do it.

23:06.149 --> 23:08.570
Dr. Charles, what a pleasant surprise.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.952
Dr. Haywood, just wanted to...

23:10.977 --> 23:12.544
To stop by, see how you're doing.

23:12.569 --> 23:15.069
Well, I won't be running a
marathon any time soon,

23:15.094 --> 23:16.918
but I'm getting along much better.

23:16.943 --> 23:19.626
You know, Sarah told me you
spent some time up in Madison.

23:19.651 --> 23:21.515
- I had no idea.
- Yeah.

23:21.540 --> 23:23.884
I spent a few semesters.

23:23.909 --> 23:25.803
You know, they keep on
bugging me to come up there

23:25.828 --> 23:27.655
and do a forensic psychiatry seminar.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.626
I don't know, worth my time?
Worth the trip?

23:29.651 --> 23:31.620
I found Madison to be

23:31.796 --> 23:35.432
a bit, uh, claustrophobic.

23:35.601 --> 23:37.902
Good to know. Good to know.

23:38.693 --> 23:41.288
- Could you do me a favor?
- Course.

23:41.313 --> 23:44.149
Would you mind... getting me a book

23:44.174 --> 23:45.942
from that box?

23:45.967 --> 23:47.878
Yeah.

24:03.061 --> 24:05.162
Ha, Grisham.

24:05.187 --> 24:07.721
Well, Sarah doesn't know me very well.

24:07.756 --> 24:09.557
All right, Dr. Haywood,

24:09.591 --> 24:11.529
time for your exercises.

24:11.554 --> 24:13.704
Sorry to cut this short, Dr. Charles.

24:14.571 --> 24:17.308
I hope you'll stop by again soon.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.234
You can count on it.

24:54.078 --> 24:56.646
The surgery was a success.

24:56.671 --> 24:57.991
We managed to replace your valve

24:58.016 --> 25:00.026
and stave off any bleeding.

25:00.909 --> 25:02.819
And the baby?

25:04.746 --> 25:07.033
The baby pulled through just fine.

25:07.689 --> 25:09.340
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

25:09.365 --> 25:10.878
Thank you.

25:11.286 --> 25:13.053
I'll be back to check in on you soon,

25:13.088 --> 25:15.256
see how you're doing, okay?

25:18.827 --> 25:20.895
Dr. Rhodes, good work.

25:20.929 --> 25:22.163
Things broke our way this time.

25:22.197 --> 25:23.695
Nonetheless, well done.

25:23.720 --> 25:26.213
Hey, I was wondering, uh,
has there been any progress

25:26.238 --> 25:27.959
on the conjoined twins simulation?

25:27.984 --> 25:29.186
Uh, Dr. Bekker and I suspect

25:29.211 --> 25:30.560
it was the placement of the clamps

25:30.585 --> 25:32.413
that caused the problem, but
we've already confirmed

25:32.438 --> 25:35.179
that the coronary vessels and
vagus nerve were not affected.

25:35.204 --> 25:38.210
What about the sinoatrial node?

25:38.470 --> 25:40.755
We hadn't considered that,
given its location.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.093
Well, the anatomy of these
hearts is highly irregular,

25:43.125 --> 25:46.794
so it's possible that
we clamped the SA node

25:46.819 --> 25:48.751
and it cut off the heart's
electrical activity.

25:48.776 --> 25:51.787
So are you suggesting moving the L.A.
clamp laterally?

25:52.134 --> 25:54.245
- Worth a shot.
- Ah...

25:54.504 --> 25:56.161
Dr. Rhodes, why don't
we test your theory

25:56.186 --> 25:58.418
before the next simulation?

25:58.443 --> 26:00.045
Meet me in the lab in an hour.

26:00.070 --> 26:02.338
Okay.

26:06.702 --> 26:09.054
I take it that means good
news for Tracy and her baby?

26:09.079 --> 26:10.045
You know what they say, right?

26:10.070 --> 26:11.937
Fortune favors the bold.

26:14.362 --> 26:16.096
Catheter's in good position.

26:16.121 --> 26:17.618
Let's double-check circuit tubing,

26:17.643 --> 26:20.948
and set goal flow at 35 to 40
ccs per kilogram per minute.

26:21.134 --> 26:23.321
I was lucky there was
an ECMO available.

26:23.346 --> 26:24.514
I was afraid they'd all be taken.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.339
Um, you...

26:29.723 --> 26:31.732
I don't think we should
put him on ECMO.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.245
Why not?

26:33.270 --> 26:35.074
The rash on Cody's IV site,

26:35.099 --> 26:37.783
given his history of intense
allergic reactions?

26:37.808 --> 26:41.233
I think he may have undiagnosed
systemic mastocytosis.

26:41.258 --> 26:43.269
You're jumping to that from a rash?

26:43.294 --> 26:45.240
Kids with mastocytosis
generally produce

26:45.265 --> 26:47.200
an overabundance of histamine.

26:47.225 --> 26:49.092
If Cody has it, passing his blood

26:49.117 --> 26:51.708
through the machine could send
him into anaphylactic shock.

26:51.733 --> 26:53.013
Given the state his lungs are in,

26:53.038 --> 26:54.410
he would not survive that.

26:54.435 --> 26:56.905
Mastocytosis is extremely
rare, Natalie,

26:56.930 --> 26:59.236
and we don't have time for
a biopsy to confirm it.

26:59.841 --> 27:01.809
Dr. Halstead, we're ready.

27:01.982 --> 27:03.534
All right.

27:03.768 --> 27:06.776
- What about PLV?
- Partial liquid ventilation?

27:06.801 --> 27:08.870
I thought that was
reserved for preemies.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.195
There have been some clinical trials

27:10.235 --> 27:11.729
with encouraging results.

27:11.754 --> 27:13.015
PLV's a good idea, in theory.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.934
I... I'm not sure we should
be risking a kid's life

27:14.959 --> 27:16.382
by using a treatment that's unproven.

27:16.407 --> 27:18.617
Will, I know we've had
our disagreements,

27:18.642 --> 27:20.889
but I really think this could work.

27:22.016 --> 27:23.840
Your patient, your call.

27:27.268 --> 27:29.584
Stop. We're not putting him on ECMO.

27:39.505 --> 27:42.841
Wait a minute, you... you're
saying you wanna drown my son?

27:42.866 --> 27:45.201
I assure you, Karen,
Cody will not drown.

27:45.235 --> 27:48.306
But you... you... you're gonna
fill his lungs with fluid.

27:48.338 --> 27:49.679
It's called Perflubron.

27:49.704 --> 27:50.879
It has unique properties,

27:50.904 --> 27:53.578
including the ability to hold
large amounts of oxygen.

27:53.603 --> 27:55.959
Yeah, at this point, Cody's
lungs are too damaged

27:55.984 --> 27:57.808
to absorb oxygen through the air,

27:57.833 --> 28:00.014
so our hope is that this treatment

28:00.039 --> 28:01.999
helps oxygen penetrate Cody's lungs

28:02.024 --> 28:03.725
and restore his breathing.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.730
- Have you done this before?
- Um...

28:06.755 --> 28:09.491
This procedure is performed
quite often with neonates.

28:09.516 --> 28:11.730
We feel strongly it's
the best chance we have

28:11.755 --> 28:14.057
at saving your son's life.

28:21.149 --> 28:23.488
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

28:25.490 --> 28:27.550
Maggie, I'm gonna be out of
pocket for a little bit.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.410
- For how long?
- Uh, three or four hours.

28:29.444 --> 28:31.839
If anybody needs me, just
redirect them to Dr. Kwon.

28:31.864 --> 28:33.799
- You got it.
- Daniel...

28:33.918 --> 28:35.519
Where are you going?

28:39.123 --> 28:42.119
Robert Haywood still
has a storage locker

28:42.144 --> 28:43.831
in Madison, Wisconsin

28:43.856 --> 28:46.877
that he rented before
Olivia Coveny disappeared.

28:47.015 --> 28:48.538
Okay?

28:48.563 --> 28:50.122
Okay, so I'm going up
there to check it out.

28:50.147 --> 28:51.353
Come on, Daniel,

28:51.378 --> 28:53.903
let the proper authorities handle it.

28:53.928 --> 28:55.081
The proper authorities,

28:55.106 --> 28:56.553
they're just not that
interested right now.

28:56.578 --> 28:58.480
- I have a limited window.
- Stop.

28:58.505 --> 29:01.705
Look, I know you're trying
to protect Dr. Reese,

29:01.730 --> 29:03.749
but no matter what you find,

29:03.774 --> 29:07.943
you are really putting your
relationship with her at risk.

29:07.968 --> 29:09.787
Sharon, if there's even a remote chance

29:09.812 --> 29:10.967
that any of this stuff is true...

29:10.992 --> 29:13.097
And, trust me, I don't want it to be...

29:13.122 --> 29:14.968
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

29:22.422 --> 29:24.830
Hear you might have found a solution.

29:24.855 --> 29:26.355
Fingers crossed.

29:26.426 --> 29:28.994
Looks like it's all coming
up roses for you today.

29:29.279 --> 29:31.589
- You two, join me.
- Yes, sir.

29:32.444 --> 29:34.737
I mean, I'm still hoping it's
me who gets to do the surgery.

29:34.762 --> 29:36.561
No surprise there.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.136
If we move the two clamps to
the center of the bridge,

29:40.161 --> 29:41.334
between the two atria,

29:41.359 --> 29:43.657
that could solve our problem.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.476
I'll let Dr. Frisch
know that we're ready

29:45.501 --> 29:48.280
- to run another simulation.
- Okay.

29:50.272 --> 29:53.236
Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Bekker, they
need you back in the ICU.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.509
What's going on?

30:00.534 --> 30:02.185
Her BP just started plummeting.

30:02.210 --> 30:02.811
Bag her.

30:02.836 --> 30:04.113
What's going on with my daughter?

30:04.138 --> 30:06.100
- Uh, ma'am...
- She's hemorrhaging.

30:06.125 --> 30:08.335
Uh... all right.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.964
All right, hang 2 units of
O-neg on a pressure bag.

30:11.507 --> 30:13.301
Give me the ultrasound. We
need to check her fetus

30:13.326 --> 30:15.179
and take a look at her placenta.

30:19.393 --> 30:20.978
Placenta's marginally separating,

30:21.003 --> 30:23.304
- causing her to bleed.
- Fetal heart tones are strong.

30:23.329 --> 30:24.452
We'll reverse the blood thinners.

30:24.477 --> 30:26.211
Hopefully, the placenta
will tamponade itself.

30:26.236 --> 30:28.260
If we reverse the thinners,
her new valve could clot off.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.358
We'll lose mom and baby. We
have to get her to the O.R.

30:30.383 --> 30:31.962
Look, we can still save this pregnancy.

30:31.987 --> 30:32.970
It's too late for that.

30:32.995 --> 30:34.672
If we have any hope of getting
control of this bleed,

30:34.697 --> 30:36.694
she needs an emergency hysterectomy.

30:36.719 --> 30:39.350
Stop the heparin drip.
Bolus a gram of TXA.

30:39.375 --> 30:40.973
We're not gonna lose either of them.

30:51.645 --> 30:53.843
- He still hasn't woken up.
- No.

30:53.868 --> 30:55.764
How well do you know Jeremy?

30:55.789 --> 30:58.228
Not that well. I mean,
just from around.

30:58.355 --> 31:00.541
I had no idea he was using heroin.

31:00.566 --> 31:02.567
I don't think that's
what Jeremy OD'd on.

31:03.143 --> 31:04.797
- No?
- No.

31:04.894 --> 31:06.778
Pretty sure it was Percocet,

31:07.394 --> 31:09.139
which, coincidentally, is the same drug

31:09.164 --> 31:11.105
that went missing from the
dispensary last week.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.530
So?

31:13.555 --> 31:15.871
What, are you suggesting
that I took them?

31:15.896 --> 31:17.576
- Did you?
- You know how easy it is

31:17.601 --> 31:19.435
to score pharmaceuticals on the street?

31:19.460 --> 31:21.026
Jeremy could've gotten
them from anyone.

31:21.051 --> 31:22.298
But he was at the party with you.

31:22.323 --> 31:23.957
Ethan, I swear,

31:24.127 --> 31:25.886
I didn't take those drugs.

31:25.911 --> 31:27.970
So where'd you get the
money for the Louboutins?

31:28.223 --> 31:30.731
Louboutins?

31:30.853 --> 31:33.119
What do you even know about Louboutins?

31:36.611 --> 31:38.931
She put you up to this, didn't she?

31:38.956 --> 31:41.530
Your uptight narc of a girlfriend.

31:41.555 --> 31:43.141
You know, all the two of you
have done since I moved in

31:43.166 --> 31:45.038
is hover around, waiting
for me to make a mistake.

31:45.063 --> 31:45.970
That's not true.

31:45.995 --> 31:48.045
Yeah, all my life it's been like this.

31:48.562 --> 31:50.826
- You know, I've had it.
- Emily...

31:50.851 --> 31:52.470
No, I'm not working some place

31:52.495 --> 31:54.624
- that thinks I'm a criminal.
- Em...

31:54.649 --> 31:56.978
- Emily...
- Happy?

31:57.003 --> 31:59.601
You got him all to yourself now.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.507
How's she doing?

32:09.532 --> 32:10.724
She's passing an old clot,

32:10.749 --> 32:12.314
but there's no more active bleeding.

32:12.339 --> 32:14.929
Placenta looks like
it tamponaded itself.

32:16.903 --> 32:19.272
Fetal heart tones are steady.

32:22.313 --> 32:24.114
We've got a problem.

32:24.283 --> 32:26.434
- Pressure's down.
- Heart rate's spiking.

32:26.459 --> 32:27.757
She's clotting off that valve.

32:27.782 --> 32:29.777
We need to get her to the O.R.
and replace the valve.

32:29.802 --> 32:31.338
Let's go, come on!

32:33.610 --> 32:35.346
What's happening?

32:37.403 --> 32:39.084
Stop!

32:39.735 --> 32:41.524
No pulse. She must be in V-fib.

32:41.548 --> 32:44.579
Let's get a crash cart! Come on.

32:44.632 --> 32:46.507
Come on, Tracy. Come on.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.999
- Stay with us.
- Charge to 200.

32:49.024 --> 32:51.171
Clear!

32:54.337 --> 32:55.670
No pulse.

32:55.695 --> 32:57.525
Milligram of epi.

32:58.029 --> 33:00.208
Please save her! Please!

33:00.233 --> 33:01.639
- Hold compressions.
- Come on.

33:01.664 --> 33:03.298
Clear!

33:05.333 --> 33:08.140
- Still no pulse.
- Charge again.

33:08.601 --> 33:11.093
Charge!

33:14.180 --> 33:16.569
Clear!

33:18.837 --> 33:20.533
Another milligram of epi.

33:20.558 --> 33:22.233
Connor...

33:23.254 --> 33:24.976
she's gone.

33:27.126 --> 33:29.592
Oh, God, no!

33:29.617 --> 33:33.180
No, no, no!

33:33.205 --> 33:35.240
No...

33:46.210 --> 33:48.531
Time of death, 17:23.

34:10.413 --> 34:12.964
If you want, I can help the
mother with the paperwork.

34:12.998 --> 34:16.467
No. This is my responsibility.

34:27.391 --> 34:29.966
Ms. Barker, I am so
sorry for your loss.

34:29.991 --> 34:31.880
You talked my daughter into this,

34:31.905 --> 34:34.418
and now she's gone forever.

34:35.426 --> 34:37.293
You did this.

34:37.318 --> 34:39.194
This is all your fault!

34:39.219 --> 34:41.520
It's all your fault!

34:45.667 --> 34:47.261
Dr. Manning...

34:47.862 --> 34:50.438
Cody's temp's back up to 103.7.

34:50.464 --> 34:52.431
- What are his sats?
- 83%.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.493
83? He's getting worse.

34:54.751 --> 34:56.425
Okay.

35:03.904 --> 35:06.606
- Hey, how's he doing?
- PLV's not working.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.169
- I made a huge mistake, Will.
- Natalie...

35:09.194 --> 35:11.179
No, I should've just put him on ECMO,

35:11.204 --> 35:12.484
but I got carried away,

35:12.509 --> 35:14.258
and I might've just put
his life in jeopardy.

35:14.283 --> 35:16.213
Why didn't I just listen to you?

35:16.238 --> 35:17.937
Good thing you didn't.

35:18.591 --> 35:21.374
- You were right.
- What?

35:21.399 --> 35:24.769
Cody tested positive for mastocytosis.

35:26.085 --> 35:27.946
If you had put Cody on ECMO,

35:27.971 --> 35:30.024
he could've gone into
anaphylactic shock.

35:31.444 --> 35:33.300
You may have just saved his life.

35:33.325 --> 35:36.690
No, I haven't... not yet.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.782
Guess things got out
of hand last night.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.466
Yeah, you're lucky Emily called us.

35:44.491 --> 35:46.568
According to your blood work,
you had a high concentration

35:46.593 --> 35:48.070
of opioids in your system,

35:48.095 --> 35:50.438
along with toxic levels
of acetaminophen.

35:50.463 --> 35:52.424
Most likely due to the Percocet.

35:52.449 --> 35:53.221
Yeah.

35:53.246 --> 35:54.640
So where'd you get those pills?

35:54.967 --> 35:57.224
- Do you have a prescription?
- No...

35:57.249 --> 36:00.084
I mean... my dad does.

36:00.109 --> 36:01.994
He had back surgery a few weeks ago.

36:02.019 --> 36:04.203
I swept some from his medicine cabinet.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.529
I feel like an idiot.

36:07.819 --> 36:10.454
Get some rest. We'll check on you soon.

36:14.264 --> 36:15.931
You think he's telling the truth?

36:15.956 --> 36:17.690
No reason to doubt him.

36:17.859 --> 36:21.361
When it comes to my sister, I'm
so used to assuming the worst.

36:21.576 --> 36:24.444
I never should've accused her
of stealing those drugs.

36:25.364 --> 36:27.700
Have Noah work up Jeremy's discharge.

36:27.951 --> 36:30.986
I need to find Emily,
make things right.

36:42.671 --> 36:44.546
Dr. Manning?

36:44.733 --> 36:46.267
Yes?

36:58.099 --> 37:00.430
Cody's sats are back above 90.

37:00.832 --> 37:02.831
Looks like he's out of the woods.

37:03.547 --> 37:06.161
Thank you for saving my boy.

37:06.186 --> 37:07.853
Of course.

37:09.411 --> 37:10.878
I just found out myself.

37:10.903 --> 37:13.504
Neurology's in there
now, doing a quick exam.

37:14.007 --> 37:17.086
You know what, we did good today.

37:17.225 --> 37:19.647
Yeah, we did, didn't we?

37:19.672 --> 37:21.269
I mean, together.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.913
Dr. Rhodes, good.

37:41.938 --> 37:43.839
We're just about to get started.

37:45.407 --> 37:47.122
You coming?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.894
Dr. Latham, with your permission,

37:49.919 --> 37:52.328
I would like to remove
myself from the team.

37:56.496 --> 37:57.863
Why?

37:57.897 --> 37:59.788
I think it would be
best for the patients

37:59.813 --> 38:01.447
and for everyone involved.

38:01.646 --> 38:04.347
A surgery with this level of difficulty

38:04.372 --> 38:06.336
and in that environment...

38:08.778 --> 38:11.173
I don't know that I can
trust my judgment.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.073
Are you sure about this?

38:13.479 --> 38:15.478
Yes.

38:15.503 --> 38:16.940
Mm.

38:18.212 --> 38:19.714
Very well.

38:39.434 --> 38:42.609
So, your dad had back surgery?

38:43.053 --> 38:44.354
Yeah.

38:44.379 --> 38:46.032
Awfully convenient.

38:46.746 --> 38:48.433
Well, I told you,

38:49.090 --> 38:50.484
that's where I got them.

38:50.509 --> 38:52.250
Mm-hmm.

38:53.043 --> 38:54.991
According to your tox screen,

38:55.016 --> 38:57.922
the Percocet you took
were hospital grade.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.704
That means they didn't come from

38:59.729 --> 39:01.713
your dad's medicine cabinet.

39:05.044 --> 39:06.742
Possessing a Schedule Two narcotic

39:06.767 --> 39:08.580
with that level of potency

39:08.605 --> 39:10.511
is a felony offense.

39:10.975 --> 39:12.885
Now, I'm not gonna report you,

39:13.497 --> 39:15.248
but I need you to tell me.

39:17.649 --> 39:19.374
Emily.

39:20.249 --> 39:21.926
She sold them to me.

39:25.512 --> 39:27.053
Emily?

39:29.217 --> 39:30.712
Em?

39:38.428 --> 39:42.966
_

40:43.055 --> 40:44.689
What's up?

40:44.714 --> 40:47.999
You want a rematch?

40:48.701 --> 40:50.201
I was just wondering,

40:50.237 --> 40:52.337
are you still holding
onto Mom's wedding ring?

40:52.362 --> 40:54.096
Yeah, of course. Why wouldn't I?

40:55.958 --> 40:57.653
Oh...

41:00.100 --> 41:01.884
Just trying not to be a knucklehead.

41:01.909 --> 41:04.630
Okay, uh, well, come on in,

41:04.655 --> 41:06.371
and I'll go get it.
