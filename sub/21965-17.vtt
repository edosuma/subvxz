Yes, she has.

Heh. What's with

the mustache?

00:34.709 --> 00:36.667
I'm practicing

00:34.709 --> 00:36.667

00:36.709 --> 00:40.000
I have the role of the villain,

00:36.709 --> 00:40.000
Bad News Bruce.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.166
But you are neither a villain

00:40.041 --> 00:42.166
nor a Bruce.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.625
You are a Cody Burns.

00:45.208 --> 00:48.208
You know, for fun.

I fail to see the good

00:48.250 --> 00:51.458
in falsifying one's identity.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.166
Sometimes police

00:51.500 --> 00:54.166
do it on TV shows.

00:54.208 --> 00:57.667
They catch more bad guys

Uh, maybe these detective movies

Hustle up, team.

( engine revs, tires screech )

08:46.208 --> 08:49.625
Any second now,

08:46.208 --> 08:49.625
Chase'll slam on the brakes.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.750
Any second...

08:51.792 --> 08:53.208
Or not.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.667
Where's he going?

08:54.709 --> 08:56.166
Chief, do something.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.542
Chase is the victim

08:56.208 --> 08:58.542
of grand theft Autobot.

08:58.583 --> 09:01.834
But Blades, nobody can make you

08:58.583 --> 09:01.834
Bots do what you don't want do.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.792
Trust me, I've tried.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.000
You think Chase wanted

09:03.834 --> 09:06.000
to go with Evan and Myles

09:06.041 --> 09:07.709
for some reason?

09:07.750 --> 09:09.917
He has been

09:07.750 --> 09:09.917
acting weird lately.

09:09.959 --> 09:11.625
I haven't noticed anything.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.166
His optics were clear,

09:11.667 --> 09:14.166
his spark pulse normal.

09:14.208 --> 09:16.000
There's an easy way

09:14.208 --> 09:16.000
to find out.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.291
Police Robot,

09:16.041 --> 09:18.291
report your 20.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.834
Chase is ignoring

09:19.750 --> 09:21.834
the Chief?

09:21.875 --> 09:24.834
Or more likely, he doesn't want

09:21.875 --> 09:24.834
to reveal his identity

09:24.875 --> 09:26.542
in front of those thieves.

09:28.208 --> 09:31.250
Dad, Chase just drove into a

09:28.208 --> 09:31.250
zone where the cameras are down.

09:31.291 --> 09:32.959
He must have

09:31.291 --> 09:32.959
some kind of plan.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.917
If he had a plan,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.917
he would've run it by me first.

09:35.959 --> 09:38.083
Maybe it's a secret plan.

09:38.125 --> 09:41.083
No, the Chase I know would

09:38.125 --> 09:41.083
never go rogue on a mission.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.667
Something's not right.

09:45.041 --> 09:47.000
MYLES:

09:45.041 --> 09:47.000
Stealing a police car?

09:47.041 --> 09:49.667
Chief Burns just got

09:47.041 --> 09:49.667
Chief Burn-ed.

09:49.709 --> 09:52.709
Let's take this baby outside

09:49.709 --> 09:52.709
and hook her up to big mama.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.917
Police log, undercover mission.

09:58.959 --> 10:01.709
Something tells me these

09:58.959 --> 10:01.709
two mugs are cooking up a plan

10:01.750 --> 10:03.959
so big they'll need

10:01.750 --> 10:03.959
an extra chili pot.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.625
I need to report their

10:04.000 --> 10:08.625
exact plan back to my chief.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.667
So I'm sticking around

10:08.667 --> 10:10.667
until I find out

10:10.709 --> 10:13.208
what they're serving

10:10.709 --> 10:13.208
for dessert.

10:13.250 --> 10:16.625
If X marks the spot,

10:13.250 --> 10:16.625
these goons are tic-tac-toeing

10:16.667 --> 10:18.125
their way to Doc's lab.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.125
Chief, Chase reporting in.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.834
Communications are blocked.

10:22.875 --> 10:26.083
My com is as useless

10:22.875 --> 10:26.083
as swim trunks in a sandbox.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.542
But maybe outside I--

10:26.125 --> 10:28.542
MYLES: Hey.

10:28.583 --> 10:31.709
Hold it right there, robot.

10:28.583 --> 10:31.709
Where do you think you're going?

10:31.750 --> 10:33.792
( robotic voice ):

10:31.750 --> 10:33.792
Awaiting input.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.917
Nice.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.917
Check it out bro.

10:35.959 --> 10:38.000
This hunk of junk

10:35.959 --> 10:38.000
has to do anything we say.

10:38.041 --> 10:40.834
Hey, CopBot.

10:38.041 --> 10:40.834
Change into a car.

10:43.750 --> 10:44.959
Now back to a robot.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.291
Hop on one foot.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.834
Do push-ups.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.834
Now act like

10:54.875 --> 10:56.834
a chicken.

10:57.917 --> 10:59.667
( both laughing )

10:59.709 --> 11:01.750
Uh...

11:01.792 --> 11:05.000
Huh?

11:01.792 --> 11:05.000
Oh, you're evil, bro.

11:05.041 --> 11:08.208
Okay, robot,

11:05.041 --> 11:08.208
repeat after me,

11:08.250 --> 11:12.542
"Evan and Myles rule,

11:08.250 --> 11:12.542
the Burnses just drool."

11:12.583 --> 11:13.875
( sighs )

11:13.917 --> 11:15.583
( robotic voice ):

11:13.917 --> 11:15.583
Evan and Myles rule,

11:15.625 --> 11:17.667
the Burnses just drool.

11:17.709 --> 11:19.667
( both laugh )

11:19.709 --> 11:20.875
Yeah.

11:20.917 --> 11:22.834
New orders, gear brain.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.667
Steal us some floatium

11:22.875 --> 11:24.667
from the lab.

11:25.709 --> 11:27.208
I said move it.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.041
( engine starts )

11:37.917 --> 11:39.542
It's too perfect.

11:39.583 --> 11:42.625
Robo-dude takes the fall for us,

11:39.583 --> 11:42.625
and we get what we need

11:42.667 --> 11:44.875
to finish our rocking plan.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.834
Police log,

11:47.208 --> 11:48.834
undercover mission.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.834
I knew I was in deep.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.917
But Chief needed to know

11:50.875 --> 11:53.917
what these leeches had planned.

11:53.959 --> 11:55.875
So I had to go deeper.

11:55.917 --> 11:59.667
It was time

11:55.917 --> 11:59.667
to take off my swimmies.

11:59.709 --> 12:00.917
( powering up )

12:03.166 --> 12:05.250
( roaring )

12:05.291 --> 12:07.500
Down, Trex.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.500
Good boy.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.875
( cooing )

12:11.083 --> 12:13.083
( alarm beeping )

12:15.875 --> 12:19.583
Floatium, in its pure form,

12:15.875 --> 12:19.583
can make anything fly.

12:19.625 --> 12:21.583
But how does that fit

12:19.625 --> 12:21.583
into the plan?

12:25.208 --> 12:27.625
I can't believe

12:25.208 --> 12:27.625
you made it past security.

12:27.667 --> 12:29.166
Change into a car, robot.

12:29.208 --> 12:30.625
We're keeping you around.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.667
( engine starting )

12:34.709 --> 12:35.917
(  rock theme playing  )

12:37.208 --> 12:38.750
CHIEF ( on megaphone ):

12:37.208 --> 12:38.750
Police-Bot.

12:40.041 --> 12:41.583
Stand down.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.000
Why don't you tell Chief Burns

12:43.041 --> 12:45.667
what we taught you to say.

12:45.709 --> 12:47.041
Do it, robot.

12:49.041 --> 12:51.125
CHASE ( over loudspeaker ):

12:49.041 --> 12:51.125
Evan and Myles rule,

12:51.166 --> 12:54.792
the Burnses just...drool.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.250
Did Chase just...insult us?

12:57.291 --> 12:59.166
( both chuckling )

12:59.208 --> 13:01.667
I can serve you

12:59.208 --> 13:01.667
more efficiently

13:01.709 --> 13:04.667
if you inform me

13:01.709 --> 13:04.667
of your overall plan.

13:04.709 --> 13:07.166
The plan is,

13:04.709 --> 13:07.166
get us out of here.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.625
Now.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.041
Power up and energize.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.750
( grunting )

13:15.834 --> 13:17.834
Whoa. What just happened?

13:17.875 --> 13:20.000
I don't think Chase

13:17.875 --> 13:20.000
likes us anymore.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.959
He's not getting away

13:20.041 --> 13:21.959
that easy.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.709
Heatwave, think.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.125
There must be a good explanation

13:23.750 --> 13:26.125
for Chase's behavior.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.750
He'd never

13:26.166 --> 13:27.750
turn on us intentionally.

13:27.792 --> 13:29.208
KADE:

13:27.792 --> 13:29.208
Um, hi, Dad.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.542
Did you not just see

13:29.250 --> 13:31.542
the same thing we all did?

13:31.583 --> 13:34.583
He wouldn't be the first

13:31.583 --> 13:34.583
Cybertronian to change sides.

13:34.625 --> 13:36.083
Cody, where's Chase headed?

13:36.125 --> 13:38.667
The camera's fuzzing out again.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.834
Must be his new

13:38.709 --> 13:40.834
partners' doing.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.500
Heatwave, I think Chase

13:40.875 --> 13:43.500
is still on our side.

13:43.542 --> 13:45.000
Cody...

13:43.542 --> 13:45.000
Why's that, son?

13:45.041 --> 13:47.000
Well, when Chase

13:45.041 --> 13:47.000
called you a name,

13:47.041 --> 13:48.709
he didn't use his real voice.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.667
He's still acting

13:48.750 --> 13:51.667
like he's a robot.

13:51.709 --> 13:53.834
I think he's undercover.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.792
Like in the detective movies

13:53.875 --> 13:55.792
I gave him.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.250
Could be.

13:57.291 --> 13:58.750
Back to the firehouse, team.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.625
We're not giving up

13:58.792 --> 14:00.625
on Chase yet.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.583
Even if he already

14:00.667 --> 14:02.583
gave up on us?

14:11.041 --> 14:13.000
Police log,

14:11.041 --> 14:13.000
undercover mission.

14:13.041 --> 14:14.625
Letting my partners down

14:13.041 --> 14:14.625
was harder

14:14.667 --> 14:16.625
than a jawbreaker

14:14.667 --> 14:16.625
in winter,

14:16.667 --> 14:20.000
but it had to be done to

14:16.667 --> 14:20.000
uncover this duo's exact plan.

14:20.041 --> 14:22.208
( powering up )

14:23.792 --> 14:25.083
Ha!

14:25.125 --> 14:26.834
Cool story, bro.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.750
Needs more floatium.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.959
Almost forgot

14:33.542 --> 14:35.959
to shield our stuff.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.792
Stay inside the green light,

14:40.792 --> 14:42.792
robot.

14:42.834 --> 14:45.709
Unless you wanna get fried like

14:42.834 --> 14:45.709
all the other tech in town.

14:48.542 --> 14:49.875
( electricity crackling )

14:51.625 --> 14:53.792
Griffin Rock's

14:51.625 --> 14:53.792
going back to the stone age.

14:53.834 --> 14:56.667
We're going shopping.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.458
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:05.792 --> 15:07.500
( electricity crackling )

15:15.208 --> 15:18.166
Heatwave, come in.

15:15.208 --> 15:18.166
Emergency.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.583
Exclamation of frustration.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.333
The signal is still blocked.

15:21.375 --> 15:24.333
And I can't enter that red zone

15:21.375 --> 15:24.333
without shutting down.

15:24.375 --> 15:26.375
Hmm.

15:26.417 --> 15:28.208
( buttons dinging )

15:30.792 --> 15:32.709
( Heatwave groans )

15:32.750 --> 15:35.625
Chase'll come back,

15:32.750 --> 15:35.625
you'll see.

15:35.667 --> 15:38.166
And if he doesn't, we can get

15:35.667 --> 15:38.166
Bumblebee to join the team.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.583
Kade, not helping.

15:40.709 --> 15:42.041
( sighs ):

15:42.083 --> 15:43.250
Dani's been getting calls

15:43.291 --> 15:45.500
about a strange red light

15:43.291 --> 15:45.500
outside.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.333
Anybody wanna go take a look?

15:47.375 --> 15:49.458
Uh, sounds great, Dad.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.250
But I'm about to beat

15:49.500 --> 15:51.250
Graham's high score.

15:51.291 --> 15:52.500
Call me if you need me.

15:52.542 --> 15:55.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:56.458 --> 15:57.792
( electricity crackling )

16:03.083 --> 16:04.291
Aah!

16:06.333 --> 16:07.500
I'm okay.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.583
Evan and Myles

16:07.542 --> 16:09.583
on the loose,

16:09.625 --> 16:11.667
and a mysterious red light.

16:11.709 --> 16:14.083
Something tells me

16:11.709 --> 16:14.083
it's not a coincidence.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.333
Whoever's behind it,

16:14.125 --> 16:16.333
it's getting closer.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.000
CHASE ( on com ):

16:16.375 --> 16:18.000
Attention Rescue Bots.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.500
You must avoid the red beam

16:18.041 --> 16:20.500
at all costs.

16:20.542 --> 16:22.125
That's Chase.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.583
See? I knew

16:22.166 --> 16:24.583
he wouldn't abandon the team.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.667
What's to say

16:24.625 --> 16:26.667
this isn't a trap?

16:26.709 --> 16:30.125
Seems strange to be warning you

16:26.709 --> 16:30.125
if he was trying to trap you.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.667
( car approaching )

16:32.667 --> 16:34.166
( electricity crackling )

16:34.208 --> 16:35.333
Uh, guys,

16:35.375 --> 16:36.625
he isn't slowing down.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.750
What are you doing?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.750
Get off.

16:42.792 --> 16:45.083
Negative. This force field

16:42.792 --> 16:45.083
is the only thing

16:45.125 --> 16:47.500
that can protect us

16:45.125 --> 16:47.500
from the tech wrecker device.

16:47.542 --> 16:50.333
Tech wrecker?

16:47.542 --> 16:50.333
Is that what's causing the beam?

16:50.375 --> 16:52.500
Yes. Evan and Myles'

16:50.375 --> 16:52.500
true plan.

16:52.542 --> 16:54.208
Let me explain.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.750
( pinball machine beeping )

16:55.792 --> 16:57.750
Oh, yeah!

16:57.792 --> 16:59.709
High score.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.709
Graham is so owned.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.333
( electricity crackling )

16:59.750 --> 17:01.333
Huh?

17:01.375 --> 17:02.625
What?

17:02.667 --> 17:04.166
Wait.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.291
( gasps )

17:07.333 --> 17:09.083
No!

17:09.125 --> 17:11.542
(  rock theme playing  )

17:21.750 --> 17:23.500
( laughing )

17:23.542 --> 17:25.208
So as Cody advised,

17:25.250 --> 17:28.250
I used my imagination

17:25.250 --> 17:28.250
to go undercover.

17:28.291 --> 17:30.291
We never really

17:28.291 --> 17:30.291
doubted you, Chase.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.000
Right, Heatwave?

17:32.041 --> 17:34.667
Wrong. Running off like that

17:32.041 --> 17:34.667
endangers all of us.

17:34.709 --> 17:36.333
Plus we missed you.

17:36.375 --> 17:38.625
There'll be time

17:36.375 --> 17:38.625
to work all this out later.

17:38.667 --> 17:41.125
Right now we have to see

17:38.667 --> 17:41.125
what damage that beam did.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.166
And stop Evan and Myles.

17:43.208 --> 17:46.000
But how?

17:43.208 --> 17:46.000
No tech, remember?

17:46.041 --> 17:47.542
Yeah, our com's

17:46.041 --> 17:47.542
won't even work.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.667
And if the Bots

17:47.583 --> 17:49.667
have to stay under that shield,

17:49.709 --> 17:51.041
they won't be

17:49.709 --> 17:51.041
much help.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.417
Then we'll have

17:51.083 --> 17:53.417
to get creative.

17:53.458 --> 17:57.166
Okay, who forgot to pay

17:53.458 --> 17:57.166
the electricity bill?

18:00.458 --> 18:03.041
Nice haul, bro.

18:00.458 --> 18:03.041
Let's get more.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.417
Dad, I haven't ridden

18:06.041 --> 18:08.417
one of these things in years.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.417
You'll get lots of practice

18:08.458 --> 18:11.417
by the time we reach downtown.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.458
( sighs ):

18:14.667 --> 18:16.458
Fine.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
( rings bell )

18:18.542 --> 18:20.166
So we're just

18:18.542 --> 18:20.166
gonna wait here

18:20.208 --> 18:22.083
while there are people

18:20.208 --> 18:22.083
that need saving?

18:22.125 --> 18:24.166
Perhaps we can assist

18:22.125 --> 18:24.166
in another way:

18:24.208 --> 18:26.458
by destroying

18:24.208 --> 18:26.458
the source of the problem.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.208
How are we supposed

18:26.500 --> 18:29.208
to do anything under this?

18:29.250 --> 18:31.458
There's not even

18:29.250 --> 18:31.458
enough room to transform.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.125
Ugh.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.125
Wait.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.125
Watch your foot.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.125
Okay, not working.

18:37.166 --> 18:38.667
( groans )

18:38.709 --> 18:42.375
All right.

18:38.709 --> 18:42.375
Rescue Bots, walk to the rescue.

18:42.417 --> 18:45.125
Left, right.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.500
Left, right.

18:51.166 --> 18:53.458
Careful, Mr. Harrison.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.542
Have you ever considered

18:53.500 --> 18:56.542
walking to work?

18:59.375 --> 19:01.625
( grunting )

19:07.083 --> 19:08.625
( groaning )

19:09.625 --> 19:11.375
All clear, Cody.

19:15.208 --> 19:17.125
Dad, look.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.792
Roadblock, team.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.166
Chill, bro.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.709
They're nothing

19:23.208 --> 19:25.709
without their robot butlers.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.375
(  triumphant theme playing  )

19:32.375 --> 19:34.083
Yah!

19:32.375 --> 19:34.083
( grunts )

19:36.375 --> 19:38.166
( both panting )

19:38.208 --> 19:40.000
( both grunt )

19:40.041 --> 19:43.083
Some of us can

19:40.041 --> 19:43.083
still kick it old school.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.166
ALL:

19:44.583 --> 19:47.166
Left, right, left, right,

19:44.583 --> 19:47.166
left, right,

19:47.208 --> 19:49.166
left, right, left, right.

19:49.208 --> 19:50.458
( groans )

19:50.500 --> 19:52.500
Well, that was humiliating.

19:52.542 --> 19:54.250
I thought

19:52.542 --> 19:54.250
it showed teamwork.

19:54.291 --> 19:57.375
The real challenge will be

19:54.291 --> 19:57.375
accessing the tech wrecker.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.417
I'll just fly up there and--

19:59.458 --> 20:02.000
Oh, right.

19:59.458 --> 20:02.000
The shield.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.417
Evan and Myles

20:02.041 --> 20:04.417
put that device in the sky.

20:04.458 --> 20:08.000
Perhaps if we imagined

20:04.458 --> 20:08.000
we were villains like them,

20:08.041 --> 20:09.500
we could think

20:08.041 --> 20:09.500
of a solution.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.000
That's the dumbest thing I've--

20:11.041 --> 20:14.250
Hello, I'm Myles.

20:11.041 --> 20:14.250
I love to steal.

20:14.291 --> 20:15.750
( mumbles )

20:15.792 --> 20:18.417
I'm like Evan,

20:15.792 --> 20:18.417
because I'm not saying anything.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.709
HEATWAVE:

20:18.458 --> 20:19.709
Oh, come on.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.375
Pretending doesn't help.

20:21.417 --> 20:23.208
If I was a villain,

20:21.417 --> 20:23.208
I'd think of a million

20:23.250 --> 20:25.083
better things to do

20:23.250 --> 20:25.083
with floatium than--

20:25.125 --> 20:27.041
ALL:

20:25.125 --> 20:27.041
The floatium!

20:27.083 --> 20:30.500
And I just unproved

20:27.083 --> 20:30.500
my point, huh?

20:32.375 --> 20:34.125
Prepare for liftoff.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.750
HEATWAVE:

20:38.500 --> 20:40.750
Oh, this is ridiculous.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.667
BLADES:

20:42.250 --> 20:43.667
Actually, flying's not so bad

20:43.709 --> 20:45.375
with all of you here.

20:49.375 --> 20:50.667
CODY: We did it!

20:49.375 --> 20:50.667
HEATWAVE: Good job.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.417
About time.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.417
CHASE: Outstanding.

20:52.458 --> 20:56.000
Imagination is clearly a useful

20:52.458 --> 20:56.000
tool in rescue operations.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.458
HEATWAVE:

20:56.041 --> 20:57.458
Hope that means

20:56.041 --> 20:57.458
you've thought of a way

20:57.500 --> 21:00.166
for us to get back down.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.625
(  majestic theme playing  )

21:04.625 --> 21:09.041
And, like a swimming pool

21:04.625 --> 21:09.041
in winter, the case was closed.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.000
Who are you

21:09.083 --> 21:11.000
talking to?

21:11.041 --> 21:13.041
Your spark was

21:11.041 --> 21:13.041
in the right place, Chase.

21:13.083 --> 21:15.417
But in the future,

21:13.083 --> 21:15.417
share your plan with the team.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.667
Understood.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.542
Would you care to

21:16.709 --> 21:18.542
hear my current plan?

21:18.583 --> 21:20.333
Care for

21:18.583 --> 21:20.333
an honest answer?

21:20.375 --> 21:23.542
Cody and I will be practicing

21:20.375 --> 21:23.542
for his school play.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.667
Fortunately,

21:23.583 --> 21:26.667
I will be playing the Good Guy.

21:26.709 --> 21:30.542
I find my imagination has been

21:26.709 --> 21:30.542
stretched enough for one day.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.166
(  dramatic theme playing  )
