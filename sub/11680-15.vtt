WEBVTT

00:00.501 --> 00:02.066
My name is michael westen.

00:02.067 --> 00:03.266
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.701 --> 00:07.234
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.667
When you're burned,
you've got nothing -

00:09.734 --> 00:12.334
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.701
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.767 --> 00:16.734
Where am i?
Miami.

00:16.801 --> 00:19.968
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:20.033 --> 00:22.601
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.266
A trigger-Happy
ex-Girlfriend...

00:24.267 --> 00:25.933
should we shoot them?

00:25.934 --> 00:28.434
...an old friend who used
to inform on you to the fbi...

00:28.501 --> 00:30.834
you know spies -
A bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.901 --> 00:33.367
...family, too...
hey, is that your mom again?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.534
...if you're desperate. Someone
needs your help, michael.

00:35.601 --> 00:38.033
Bottom line -
As long as you're burned,

00:38.100 --> 00:40.000
You're not going anywhere.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.467
If someone calls a meeting
in a deserted location,

00:49.534 --> 00:51.099
They want control.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.534
They can tell if you're alone,
and if you try anything,

00:53.601 --> 00:55.534
It's easy to take you out
with a sniper.

00:55.601 --> 00:58.067
So, if someone wants a chat
in the middle of nowhere,

00:58.133 --> 00:59.999
It never hurts to bring
a sniper of your own.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.833
You're awfully quiet,
sam.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.366
Yeah, well,
what do you want me to say?

01:03.367 --> 01:06.000
That i'm worried gilroy got wind
that you're double-Crossing him,

01:06.067 --> 01:08.234
Or that i got a bad feeling
about this mystery man

01:08.300 --> 01:09.800
That he wants to jailbreak?

01:09.801 --> 01:11.701
Everything's fine.
Just calm down.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.399
No, i don't think i will.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.199
You know what kinds of people
they ferry around

01:15.200 --> 01:17.801
On secret planes
in super-Max custody?

01:17.868 --> 01:19.600
People with forked tongues,
mike.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.199
People with hair
on their palms.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.999
Maybe you want a closer look
at this monster,

01:23.000 --> 01:24.433
But i say it's time
to walk away.

01:24.434 --> 01:26.132
Gilroy's doing this
with or without me.

01:26.133 --> 01:28.300
We can't stop him till we know
how he's pulling it off.

01:28.367 --> 01:29.700
Yeah, well,
you know what they say

01:29.701 --> 01:31.299
About holding a snake
by the tail, mike.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.967
I think it's a tiger
by the tail, sam.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.466
Yeah, well, either way,

01:34.467 --> 01:36.367
You let go of it
before it eats your face off.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.900
He's here, sam.

01:38.901 --> 01:40.500
Try and stay in the open,
will you?

01:40.501 --> 01:41.833
I can't cover
a moving car.

01:41.834 --> 01:45.033
And if that evil limey
mastermind offers you a ride,

01:45.100 --> 01:46.833
You treat him
like a stranger with candy,

01:46.834 --> 01:48.066
And you say,
"no, thank you, sir."

01:48.067 --> 01:51.167
Nice wheels, gilroy.
Gilroy: you like?

01:51.234 --> 01:53.901
Cost me a fortune,
but she's armored like a tank.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.900
Sorry to ring you
out of the blue,

01:58.901 --> 02:00.901
But it's
such a lovely day.

02:00.968 --> 02:02.366
I thought we'd go
for a drive.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.100
Oh, mike, don't you dare.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.133
Why not?

02:09.167 --> 02:11.167
Ah.
Why am i still surprised?

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074

02:30.567 --> 02:32.767
The curtain's about to part
for our grand finale,

02:32.834 --> 02:35.534
But there remains
one minor detail to address.

02:35.601 --> 02:38.567
This compound belongs
to the knights of resistance,

02:38.634 --> 02:40.834
A group
of right-Wing separatists.

02:40.901 --> 02:43.501
White supremacists.
Potato, po-Tah-To.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.868
Now, you're to purchase an item
from their armory.

02:45.934 --> 02:47.366
An item?

02:47.367 --> 02:49.601
You want me to go on a gun buy
without a shopping list.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.868
I thought we were playing
for the same team, gilroy.

02:51.934 --> 02:53.466
Indeed we are.

02:53.467 --> 02:56.434
I suppose you've earned
your place in this partnership.

02:56.501 --> 02:58.968
It's a browning
.50-Caliber machine gun.

02:59.033 --> 03:01.801
Happy?
Thrilled...partner.

03:01.868 --> 03:03.366
You're to ask for duke.

03:03.367 --> 03:05.267
The price has been
pre-Negotiated.

03:08.767 --> 03:10.667
Well, off you go.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.666
Appreciate you
making the trip.

03:22.667 --> 03:25.167
Too many of our white brothers
aren't willing to drive out here,

03:25.234 --> 03:27.234
Even if it means buying
from the cubans and jamaicans.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.501
No offense, but i'm here
for the price, not the people,

03:29.567 --> 03:31.199
And the only color
i care about is green.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.466
We gonna do this or not?

03:32.467 --> 03:34.099
Suit yourself.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.000
Right through here.

03:40.634 --> 03:43.400
Uh, something you want to
tell me, duke?

03:43.467 --> 03:46.601
See, we ain't arms dealers.
We're freedom fighters.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.099
Our guns
aren't for sale,

03:48.100 --> 03:50.567
But we'd like to thank you
for your donation.

03:50.634 --> 03:53.033
Anything
to help the cause.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.000
You want to
help the cause?

03:55.767 --> 03:57.266
Get a new favorite color.

03:57.267 --> 03:59.801
Fighting two against one
is never ideal,

03:59.868 --> 04:01.533
But there are ways
to even the odds.

04:01.534 --> 04:03.166
Jam your opponents
into a corner,

04:03.167 --> 04:05.467
And they won't have room
to use both arms.

04:05.534 --> 04:08.000
It's like fighting one person
with two angry heads.

04:08.067 --> 04:12.501
It makes them easier to engage
and easier to disengage.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.567
Didn't go as planned.

04:20.634 --> 04:22.466
Actually, it went
exactly as planned.

04:22.467 --> 04:24.400
You still have the money.
I have a new toy.

04:24.467 --> 04:26.467
How'd that case treat you,
by the way?

04:26.534 --> 04:28.066
Handy.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.700
It's never fun
being used as a diversion,

04:29.701 --> 04:31.868
But it is an effective way
to get the drop on an enemy

04:31.934 --> 04:34.100
With superior numbers
and firepower.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.501
Then it's all about
making a clean getaway.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.467
If you can't do that, it never
hurts to be in an armored car.

04:41.316 --> 04:45.367
Transcrypt by www.Addic7ed.Com

04:49.701 --> 04:51.533
You know,
i had a funny feeling

04:51.534 --> 04:53.434
Those guys might try
to rip us off.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.032
Eat or be eaten,
i suppose.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.067
Next time you send me in
as a decoy,

04:57.133 --> 04:58.633
A heads-Up would be nice.

04:58.634 --> 05:00.233
Honestly, michael,
if you couldn't survive

05:00.234 --> 05:02.200
A go-Round with duke and jimbo,
you deserve to get killed.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.066
Thanks to you,

05:04.067 --> 05:06.200
Security at the armory
wasn't exactly watertight.

05:06.267 --> 05:07.500
You know,
.50 caliber -

05:07.501 --> 05:09.199
That's quite a party favor,
gilroy.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.933
I find
that.50-Caliber rounds

05:10.934 --> 05:13.534
Have a delightful way
of making one's problems die.

05:13.601 --> 05:15.333
That's funny.

05:15.334 --> 05:17.934
Artillery like that makes me
a little itchy about this job.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.067
If you want me to scratch
your back, just say so.

05:20.133 --> 05:21.700
We're having
a dress rehearsal tomorrow.

05:21.701 --> 05:23.767
You'll get everything
you need to know, partner.

05:23.834 --> 05:26.234
Until then, ta-Ta.

05:34.701 --> 05:37.067
Sam, you're doing dishes.

05:37.133 --> 05:39.334
Yeah, well, i had to do
something to pass the time.

05:41.367 --> 05:43.534
You have any idea
what you put me through,

05:43.569 --> 05:45.701
Getting in that car
with jack the ripper?

05:45.767 --> 05:47.901
So, you got enough intel on this
dirty deed to wrap up gilroy?

05:47.968 --> 05:49.733
Well, not exactly,

05:49.734 --> 05:52.033
But i did help him steal
a browning.50 cal.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.000
Well, forgive me if i don't
pat you on the back.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.900
Do you think
you could get in touch

05:55.901 --> 05:57.500
With your contacts
at the fbi?

05:57.501 --> 06:00.234
You know, the ones you
used to inform on me to?

06:00.300 --> 06:02.200
Yeah, no problemo.

06:02.968 --> 06:04.868
For your sake, michael,
i hoped you were dead.

06:04.903 --> 06:06.333
I can put up with a lot,

06:06.334 --> 06:08.467
But four calls without
so much as a text back?

06:08.534 --> 06:10.233
That just takes me
right to the edge.

06:10.234 --> 06:11.600
What's on your mind, fi?

06:11.601 --> 06:13.868
A hustler named coleman
wants to meet about a gig.

06:13.934 --> 06:15.934
He once helped me
with a cash-Flow problem.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.133
He deals in counterfeit bags,
stolen phones.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.300
He's a harmless weasel,
but his gigs pay top dollar.

06:21.367 --> 06:23.267
I thought you might like
to come, just in case.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.166
Ooh, i have a meeting
with the fbi.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.566
Why don't you talk to sam?

06:26.567 --> 06:28.467
Sam?

06:32.434 --> 06:35.767
So, i'm in a tiny, little jam,
and i say to myself,

06:35.834 --> 06:38.534
"Coleman, if you need
a hard-Core, bad-Ass chick,

06:38.601 --> 06:41.133
"Well, bud, there's only
one lady to go to...

06:44.234 --> 06:45.533
...fiona glenanne."

06:45.534 --> 06:47.534
"Lady's" a bit of a stretch.

06:47.601 --> 06:49.233
I'm sorry.
Who are you again?

06:49.234 --> 06:50.466
Oh,
he's just my gofer.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.634
He cleans my guns,
fetches my dry cleaning.

06:52.701 --> 06:53.999
What kind of job
we talking about here?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You know, you're awfully chatty
for the help.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.167
Yes, he is.

06:58.234 --> 07:00.400
Be quiet while the grown-Ups
are talking.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.166
Answer the question anyway.

07:02.167 --> 07:03.833
You know how this works,
babe.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.600
I can't tell you
exactly what the gig is

07:05.601 --> 07:07.501
Until you agree to do it.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.234
Hey, hey.
Eyes over here.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.734
You see this?

07:12.801 --> 07:16.934
That's 10 large -
5 up front, 5 when you finish.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.467
20...
because i'm worth it.

07:19.534 --> 07:22.167
Come on. After
everything we've been through?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.767
You know that i'm already
doing this at cost, right?

07:24.834 --> 07:25.800
Wow.

07:25.801 --> 07:27.701
Fine.

07:27.734 --> 07:30.200
Be at this address
at 6:00.

07:30.267 --> 07:32.267
And do us a favor -

07:32.334 --> 07:34.534
Leave mr. Chuckles at home,
will you?

07:37.133 --> 07:39.734
So, let's get this straight -
You want us to stop gilroy,

07:39.801 --> 07:41.433
Who no one can prove
is even in the country?

07:41.434 --> 07:43.601
From hijacking a plane
no government will acknowledge?

07:47.434 --> 07:48.800
That's rich, westen.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.434
Fine, alert the cia.
Make it their problem.

07:51.501 --> 07:52.833
Look,
they won't take my calls,

07:52.834 --> 07:54.199
But i figured a tip
from the fbi -

07:54.200 --> 07:55.533
Maybe they'll
take it seriously.

07:55.534 --> 07:57.601
Harris, question -
So far as it concerns

07:57.667 --> 07:59.968
Calling the territorial
jackasses at langley,

08:00.033 --> 08:02.434
Where would you put that
on the old to-Do list?

08:02.501 --> 08:04.333
Hmm.
Maybe 400, 500.

08:05.667 --> 08:08.767
Gilroy's in possession
of a.50-Cal machine gun.

08:08.834 --> 08:10.868
I have firsthand knowledge.

08:10.934 --> 08:13.133
You, uh, tell us where
he's keeping the hardware,

08:13.200 --> 08:14.967
Maybe that's something
we can work with.

08:14.968 --> 08:16.868
I don't know.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.333
Don't you think i'd tell you
if i could?

08:19.334 --> 08:21.066
So, we just have to look
under every rock

08:21.067 --> 08:22.800
From here to epcot center -
That the idea?

08:22.801 --> 08:24.099
Nah.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.000
Little suggestion
for you -

08:26.067 --> 08:27.433
Next time
you want to cry wolf,

08:27.434 --> 08:29.567
Do it at a caf?
On south beach, huh?

08:29.634 --> 08:31.534
When you're buying.

08:40.967 --> 08:43.000
You know how
some people promise

08:43.067 --> 08:45.901
Never to call the cops on
their friends, no matter what?

08:45.968 --> 08:48.934
Well, you and me -
We're still up in the air.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.633
Ah, don't get your knickers
in a twist.

08:50.634 --> 08:53.801
Coleman probably just wants
a babysitter for a gun deal.

08:53.868 --> 08:57.200
Anyone ever tell you it's rude
to text while someone's talking?

08:57.267 --> 08:58.999
Are you bugging
my cellphone?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.868
Right now, you and mike are fighting
for top bunk in sam's doghouse.

09:01.934 --> 09:04.467
I already watched one of you
wander away with a psycho today.

09:04.534 --> 09:07.100
I'll be damned
if it happens again.

09:17.334 --> 09:22.000
As promised, 10,000 ways
to say "welcome aboard."

09:23.901 --> 09:25.533
Now that i'm officially
on payroll,

09:25.534 --> 09:27.266
You want to tell me
what this is about?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.234
I'll let the boss go over
the details with you.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.601
Don't worry. We're about to have
cocktails with him right now.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.133
You're just the middleman
on this?

09:34.200 --> 09:36.834
You know,
i prefer "facilitator."

09:36.901 --> 09:38.199
Boss goes by gabriel.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.800
He's kind of picky
about who he works with,

09:39.801 --> 09:41.366
So to close the deal,

09:41.367 --> 09:43.132
I had to add a few adventures
to our work history.

09:43.133 --> 09:45.033
I told him you helped me out
with a couple of ransom jobs

09:45.067 --> 09:46.766
A few years back
in madrid.

09:46.767 --> 09:48.566
Don't worry about it. It won't
come up. It's just a meet and greet.

09:48.567 --> 09:50.934
Oh,
you got to be kidding me.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.033
Hey, if you ain't feeling it,
let me know.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.000
I'd be more than happy
to take back my 10 g's.

09:55.067 --> 09:59.000
Fi,
do not go in that house.

09:59.067 --> 10:00.967
Hey,
how you doing, fella?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.666
I really need
some new friends.

10:02.667 --> 10:05.267
There he is.
Coleman.

10:05.334 --> 10:07.901
And you must be fiona.

10:07.968 --> 10:09.500
I have to tell you,

10:09.501 --> 10:12.367
I've heard such...
wonderful things about you.

10:15.767 --> 10:18.100
But now,
seeing you in person,

10:18.167 --> 10:20.834
I get the feeling that
none of them do you justice.

10:20.901 --> 10:22.801
Oh, you haven't heard
the half of it.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.734
I'm sure i haven't.

10:25.434 --> 10:27.334
This way, please.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.901
To new friends,
wherever the road may take us.

10:31.968 --> 10:33.533
Salud.

10:33.534 --> 10:37.300
Coleman tells me that you
spent some time in madrid.

10:37.367 --> 10:39.634
For my money,

10:39.701 --> 10:43.367
There's nothing quite like an
evening stroll down la rambla.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.933
What do you think?

10:44.934 --> 10:46.968
La rambla
is in barcelona.

10:47.033 --> 10:48.433
You sure you need
another drink?

10:48.434 --> 10:51.133
Perhaps not.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.968
But that's never
stopped me before.

10:54.033 --> 10:56.434
I am going to have to
see your passport, though.

10:57.934 --> 10:59.032
Right now.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.700
Sam: crap.
My passport?

11:00.701 --> 11:02.066
I don't have it on me.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.400
You need to know my age,
you can just ask.

11:04.467 --> 11:05.967
I wouldn't dream of it.

11:05.968 --> 11:07.833
But wherever it is,

11:07.834 --> 11:12.868
It had better be stamped
"barajas airport, madrid, 2006,"

11:12.934 --> 11:15.334
Or we're going to
find ourselves

11:15.400 --> 11:17.334
In a very uncomfortable
situation.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.967
Operate in the field
long enough,

11:18.968 --> 11:20.666
And you'll find yourself
getting tested

11:20.667 --> 11:21.999
By very dangerous people.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.534
So, tell me,
where can we find it?

11:24.601 --> 11:27.033
My bedroom dresser.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.567
Third drawer has
a false bottom.

11:29.634 --> 11:32.767
Passport's under the alias
kelly minch.

11:35.701 --> 11:38.300
Please leave everything
the way you found it.

11:38.367 --> 11:40.701
The more immediate
and unexpected the test,

11:40.767 --> 11:43.133
The more likely they're
up to serious trouble,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.601
And the more likely they'll
kill you if you don't pass.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.834
Come on, mike.
Pick up, pick up.

11:47.901 --> 11:49.299
Yeah, sam.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.000
Mike, i need you to grab
the i.D. Kit i keep at the loft,

11:52.067 --> 11:53.766
Get to fi's right away.

11:53.767 --> 11:55.066
Is she okay?

11:55.067 --> 11:57.000
Yeah, as long as you get there
like 10 minutes ago.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.300
I'll buy you some time,
but you better skedaddle.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.834
Between matching holograms
and color-Shifting inks,

12:16.901 --> 12:19.701
Altering a page
in a modern passport

12:19.767 --> 12:21.801
Is virtually impossible.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.533
So, if all the pages are full

12:31.534 --> 12:34.033
And you have to adjust
someone's travel in a hurry,

12:34.100 --> 12:36.434
It's better just to swap out
the page entirely.

12:41.968 --> 12:45.067
It's as easy as pulling out the
stitching on a cheap t-Shirt.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.833
You just need the skill
to put it back together.

12:50.968 --> 12:52.299
Sam:
hey, knock yourself out.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.766
All the honking in the world

12:53.767 --> 12:55.667
Isn't gonna put my rear axle
back into alignment.

13:05.033 --> 13:07.734
Uh, mike, you got two bogeys
coming your way.

13:07.801 --> 13:09.701
I hope
you're wrapping it up.

13:09.736 --> 13:11.601
I'm doing
the best i can, sam.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.667
There's no saying "i'm sorry"
in the field,

13:17.734 --> 13:20.067
So if it feels like a gamble's
about to come up short,

13:20.133 --> 13:22.067
You put on a smile and try
to get your hands on a weapon

13:22.133 --> 13:24.467
Without anyone noticing.

13:24.534 --> 13:26.667
No need to stop the party.
Would you care for another?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.167
Excuse me.

13:58.067 --> 14:00.267
Dime.

14:00.334 --> 14:03.801
Interesante.

14:03.868 --> 14:05.768
S? Gracias.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.534
Fiona, i must apologize.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.567
In my line of work,
you can't be too careful.

14:15.634 --> 14:17.534
I know the feeling.

14:18.467 --> 14:21.567
To madrid.

14:28.152 --> 14:29.933
What the hell is going on?

14:29.934 --> 14:31.400
Look, i had nothing
to do with it.

14:31.401 --> 14:32.732
She gets an idea in that
little irish skull of hers,

14:32.733 --> 14:34.433
And that's the end of it.

14:34.434 --> 14:36.334
I'm going back in
with gabriel.

14:36.369 --> 14:37.899
For 10 grand?

14:37.900 --> 14:39.766
If someone's willing
to kill you over a passport,

14:39.767 --> 14:41.233
You walk away, fi.

14:41.234 --> 14:42.766
Ordinarily, yes.

14:42.767 --> 14:44.533
Then sam showed me this -

14:44.534 --> 14:46.934
Allen king taken at gunpoint

14:47.000 --> 14:48.500
Right after gabriel
got into town.

14:48.501 --> 14:50.333
Okay, so maybe i had a little
something to do with it.

14:50.334 --> 14:53.401
So, it's a kidnapping ring.

14:53.468 --> 14:56.134
You call the cops. It's
not your problem. The cops?

14:56.201 --> 14:58.234
Gabriel is a pro. He'd sniff
them out in a heartbeat.

14:58.301 --> 14:59.866
Did he tell you
what the job is?

14:59.867 --> 15:01.900
So, you're meeting
with a paranoid thug

15:01.967 --> 15:03.799
With no idea
what he's up to.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.934
Yeah, that sounds like a great
way to get yourself killed.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.067
Are we talking about
gabriel now or gilroy?

15:09.034 --> 15:11.934
The caption says "please
give me my daddy back."

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm not letting her
grow up without a father

15:14.067 --> 15:15.899
If i can save him
by going to a meeting.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.934
I told her it was too risky
to put a mike on her again,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.367
But, you know, it's fi.

15:20.434 --> 15:22.934
One of the doors has
a padlock in the house.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.900
Something tells me he's not
using it as a game room.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.201
I need to search it.
I don't need your permission.

15:27.267 --> 15:29.633
That passport won't be
the last time he tests you.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.000
We might not be able
to save you the next time.

15:32.067 --> 15:34.934
Just give me 10 minutes
alone in the house,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.367
And i'll see what's
behind that door.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.934
Your security has a way
of making a girl feel welcome.

15:53.633 --> 15:55.767
We're both professionals.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.666
No more games,
no more background checks.

15:57.667 --> 15:58.933
Just tell me
about the job.

15:58.934 --> 16:01.034
No, i don't think so.

16:01.101 --> 16:04.401
We don't even know
if you're qualified yet.

16:06.401 --> 16:08.133
Beretta 9-Millimeter.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.301
Break it apart
and put it back together.

16:10.367 --> 16:12.267
I'll give you
one minute.

16:12.934 --> 16:15.234
Begin.
I'm sorry.

16:15.301 --> 16:18.034
You want me to do this
with my eyes open or closed?

16:18.101 --> 16:19.699
You can tell a lot
about a person

16:19.700 --> 16:21.433
By the way they
take a pistol apart.

16:21.434 --> 16:24.600
Do they rush?
Do they take their time?

16:24.667 --> 16:26.733
Can they react quickly
when attacked?

16:30.034 --> 16:31.967
You don't scare easy.
Good.

16:43.234 --> 16:45.033
All done.

16:45.034 --> 16:46.666
How did i do?

16:46.667 --> 16:48.567
Not bad.

16:55.167 --> 16:56.833
Sam!

16:56.834 --> 16:58.266
Sorry, mike.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.100
Chewing helps me
with the nerves.

17:00.101 --> 17:02.034
You know,
it's an old s.E.A.L. Trick.

17:02.101 --> 17:03.799
So,
you think it's go time?

17:03.800 --> 17:05.165
Give it another minute.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.067
We move too soon,
they'll get suspicious.

17:07.101 --> 17:08.833
I just hate fi
being in there alone

17:08.834 --> 17:11.101
Looking for that hostage
by herself.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.633
Well, she knew what
she was getting into.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.599
Do you have
another piece? Yeah.

17:15.633 --> 17:17.532
Fiona:
coleman call in sick?

17:17.534 --> 17:19.867
Coleman won't be
joining us anymore.

17:19.934 --> 17:21.934
He forced himself
on the girl that you replaced

17:22.000 --> 17:26.034
And almost compromised
the entire operation,

17:26.101 --> 17:28.468
So he...

17:28.534 --> 17:30.166
has been dismissed.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.568
I have a terrible fear
of risk.

17:32.633 --> 17:35.434
So, let me ask you,
can i trust you, fiona?

17:35.501 --> 17:37.300
You searched me.
We did your test.

17:37.301 --> 17:38.999
You want to water-Board me,
too?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.967
Why are you here?

17:41.034 --> 17:43.067
Cash.
Isn't that why you're here?

17:43.134 --> 17:45.034
I think
you'll recognize this.

17:45.101 --> 17:47.001
This is your file
from interpol.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.266
Tell me something.

17:50.301 --> 17:51.966
Why does
a nice catholic girl

17:51.967 --> 17:53.900
With no apparent interest
in politics,

17:53.967 --> 17:55.833
No history of violence,

17:55.834 --> 17:57.666
Decide to join the ira

17:57.667 --> 17:59.467
And blow up cars
all over belfast?

17:59.468 --> 18:01.368
We didn't have
girls' soccer?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.867
Revenge. Happy?

18:05.934 --> 18:07.732
Okay, just tell me
one more time,

18:07.733 --> 18:09.567
'Cause i always
get this stuff mixed up.

18:09.568 --> 18:12.401
If fi is wearing one button down
on her blouse,

18:12.468 --> 18:14.066
Everything's groovy.

18:14.067 --> 18:15.967
Two buttons down -
Something's wrong.

18:16.034 --> 18:18.201
Yeah, well, that's a first.

18:18.267 --> 18:20.967
Too many buttons down on
a woman's blouse is a bad thing?

18:21.034 --> 18:23.201
Come on, am i right?

18:23.267 --> 18:24.966
Gilroy.

18:24.967 --> 18:27.733
Okay, see ya.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.166
Yeah.

18:29.167 --> 18:31.733
Michael, it's
the big day before our big day.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.400
I've got butterflies,

18:33.401 --> 18:35.767
But i can't work on my lines
without a script.

18:35.834 --> 18:38.733
Well, nothing ruins a script
like too much improvisation.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.100
Get something to write.

18:40.101 --> 18:42.967
I'll give you directions
to rehearsal.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.533
Look at this.

18:44.534 --> 18:48.334
After the ira,
life is good.

18:48.401 --> 18:49.999
You have a gorgeous flat,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.134
You're a star
on the black market,

18:52.201 --> 18:54.633
And then you decide
to throw it all away

18:54.700 --> 18:56.500
And move to miami.

18:56.501 --> 18:58.633
Why?
I followed a man here.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.166
And how did that work out?

19:00.167 --> 19:04.067
Not quite as i hoped.
Next question?

19:04.134 --> 19:06.101
You had a sister
named claire.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.700
One moment,
she's out shopping.

19:08.767 --> 19:12.900
The next, an english soldier
fires into a crowd.

19:12.967 --> 19:16.134
She chokes to death
on her own blood.

19:16.201 --> 19:18.934
Tell me, what was the first
thought that crossed your mind

19:19.000 --> 19:21.568
When you got that news?

19:24.034 --> 19:25.967
Man: boss.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.934
You'd better
get out here.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.800
I'll be right back.

19:34.534 --> 19:36.266
I'm sorry,
do we have a problem here?

19:36.267 --> 19:37.567
Bet your asphalt.

19:37.568 --> 19:38.999
And larry, moe,
and curly here

19:39.000 --> 19:40.799
Haven't exactly been giving me
the royal treatment,

19:40.800 --> 19:42.700
But no matter.

19:42.767 --> 19:45.101
Chuck finley, shadyglade
homeowners association.

19:45.167 --> 19:48.034
How are you, sir?
Good to see you.

19:48.101 --> 19:50.633
Anyway, a couple things i want
to bring to your attention here.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.467
This is the shadyglade h.O.A.
Rule book.

19:52.468 --> 19:55.401
Now, if you had taken a couple
hours to read appendix seven,

19:55.468 --> 19:57.733
Well, i might not be here
right now, sir.

20:03.267 --> 20:04.666
Let me ask you
a quick question.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.066
When's the last time
you mowed your lawn?

20:06.067 --> 20:07.666
He doesn't even know.
My word.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.067
That's why i'm here.
Want to point this out to you.

20:10.134 --> 20:14.234
You've got some areas that are
clearing 5 inches easy here.

20:14.301 --> 20:16.100
As a covert operative,

20:16.101 --> 20:17.632
You learn that not
every locked door

20:17.633 --> 20:19.233
Leads to the secret
you're looking for.

20:19.234 --> 20:20.799
You may be searching
for a hostage

20:20.800 --> 20:22.533
But find something
just as important,

20:22.534 --> 20:24.633
Like what your target
is obsessed with...

20:25.568 --> 20:28.568
...like what your target loves.

20:39.201 --> 20:41.468
Well, mr. Finley,
uh, i can assure you

20:41.534 --> 20:45.667
That this problem will be taken
care of immediately, okay?

20:45.733 --> 20:47.633
Uh, i'm sorry you had to
come out here.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.967
Sam: sweet georgia
with a fiddle.

20:54.034 --> 20:56.468
My goodness, sir.

20:56.534 --> 20:57.866
Is that
florida crabgrass?

20:57.867 --> 20:59.699
This is a st. Augustine
community only.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.534
Now, crabgrass is as contagious
as a brush fire.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.534
You know what happens
if it spreads?

21:04.600 --> 21:07.000
We're gonna have to ask you
to get out of the neighborhood,

21:07.067 --> 21:08.567
All right?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.333
I'll just say it again.

21:10.334 --> 21:12.033
We'd have to come right up
to you, yell in your face,

21:12.034 --> 21:13.799
"Get out!"

21:13.800 --> 21:18.834
I'm sorry, but i'm going to
have to ask you to get out now.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.699
Well, hey, that's fine.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.567
I've got everything i need
to make an assessment,

21:22.568 --> 21:23.833
And it's not gonna be
pretty, sir.

21:23.834 --> 21:26.367
Fiona.

21:26.434 --> 21:28.468
Ladies' room.

21:31.767 --> 21:34.167
You know what?

21:34.234 --> 21:37.034
I think it's time
we went for a ride.

21:37.101 --> 21:38.467
Come on.

21:38.468 --> 21:40.368
Oh, i'd love to.

21:44.334 --> 21:46.301
He buy it?

21:46.367 --> 21:48.633
Easy as
a hot-Fudge sundae.

21:52.468 --> 21:54.434
Oh, mike, does she -

21:54.501 --> 21:58.101
Two buttons down.
She's in trouble.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.034
Jesus. If he's driving like
that, we can't follow him.

22:12.101 --> 22:13.500
I know!

22:13.501 --> 22:15.166
Maybe we can pick him up
on the way back through.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.533
If they come back through.

22:16.534 --> 22:18.733
I know a back way
that runs along the road.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.700
Over there.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.800
Is my house too warm
for you?

22:31.501 --> 22:34.468
I notice that you undid
another button on your blouse.

22:34.534 --> 22:36.434
You don't miss much,
do you, gabe?

22:36.468 --> 22:39.367
Since you're looking,
you want me to undo another?

22:45.434 --> 22:47.767
I was a doctor
back in argentina.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.101
One day...

22:50.167 --> 22:52.234
an american company
came to my little town

22:52.301 --> 22:54.568
To build computer chips.

22:54.633 --> 22:57.301
The governor called it
"a day of progress."

22:57.367 --> 23:00.067
It all started
with the adults -

23:00.134 --> 23:03.134
Headaches, fevers.

23:03.201 --> 23:06.134
Usually they recovered,

23:06.201 --> 23:09.000
But with the children,
it was a different story.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.666
I did my best
to treat them,

23:13.667 --> 23:15.934
But what can you do
when a company

23:16.000 --> 23:18.534
Is dumping chemical waste
into the water table?!

23:20.134 --> 23:22.733
What can you do?!

23:25.367 --> 23:27.267
Is that really necessary?

23:40.367 --> 23:42.100
My daughter's name
was eva.

23:42.101 --> 23:44.934
She was beautiful.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.401
I tried everything
to save her.

23:49.834 --> 23:52.101
But i couldn't.

23:56.867 --> 23:58.233
Let's go.

23:58.234 --> 23:59.666
Get out.

23:59.667 --> 24:02.234
Now!

24:07.167 --> 24:09.101
Stop right there.

24:11.167 --> 24:13.033
Turn around.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.101
I wish it didn't have to
be this way,

24:15.167 --> 24:17.067
But this is so much bigger
than me,

24:17.134 --> 24:20.501
And if i can't trust you,
i cannot work with you.

24:20.568 --> 24:22.468
Now, listen -
No, stop.

24:24.468 --> 24:26.368
I think they pulled over
across the way.

24:30.733 --> 24:32.598
No, mike, sit tight.

24:32.633 --> 24:34.600
He's gonna kill her,
sam.

24:34.667 --> 24:37.234
Wh- Mike, you're not gonna hit
the guy from here with a pistol.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.434
She's better off
handling this on her own.

24:39.501 --> 24:42.267
It's like you said - She knew
what she was getting into.

24:42.334 --> 24:44.700
The hardest thing to do
when an operation goes bad

24:44.767 --> 24:46.166
Is nothing at all.

24:46.167 --> 24:48.334
It's pure torture,
but if it's the only way

24:48.401 --> 24:50.733
To give a team member
a chance at survival,

24:50.800 --> 24:53.101
You have no choice
but to stand by and watch.

24:53.167 --> 24:55.067
I am sorry.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.500
Bread pudding.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.067
My first thought
when claire died.

25:04.134 --> 25:05.666
We had a fight.

25:05.667 --> 25:08.568
I spilled juice,
cranberry juice, on her sweater,

25:08.633 --> 25:11.267
And we said vicious things,
stupid things.

25:11.334 --> 25:14.201
I made her favorite dessert
as an apology.

25:14.267 --> 25:16.167
It tasted dreadful.

25:16.234 --> 25:19.800
But claire...

25:19.867 --> 25:21.767
never knew.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.468
My little sister died
angry at me.

25:26.534 --> 25:30.134
I know how you feel about the
people who killed your daughter.

25:30.201 --> 25:32.201
I feel the same way
about the men

25:32.267 --> 25:34.834
Who kept claire
from trying my awful dessert.

25:34.900 --> 25:38.733
I- I never told anyone
that before.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.866
If you can't trust me,

25:45.867 --> 25:47.767
You go ahead
and pull that trigger.

26:07.434 --> 26:12.101
After my daughter died...

26:12.167 --> 26:14.700
i went to train with the rebels
in colombia for two years.

26:14.767 --> 26:16.867
I taught them
field medicine,

26:16.934 --> 26:21.000
And they taught me how
to fight, to survive...

26:21.067 --> 26:22.500
to do -

26:22.501 --> 26:24.401
What had to be done.
Exactly.

26:25.767 --> 26:28.334
You kidnapped
a man last week -

26:28.401 --> 26:30.266
A scientist, allen king.

26:30.267 --> 26:32.167
It was in the paper.
I could do the math.

26:32.234 --> 26:34.134
He works
for apex industries.

26:34.169 --> 26:35.799
I made it clear to them

26:35.800 --> 26:38.301
That they need to shut down
their factory in argentina.

26:38.367 --> 26:39.899
The deadline's
in five hours.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.133
They're not negotiating?

26:41.134 --> 26:43.334
Maybe not this time,

26:43.401 --> 26:45.301
But next time,
i think they will.

26:49.700 --> 26:54.767
He's head counsel for apex,
always travels with security,

26:54.834 --> 26:57.834
But, like all of us,
he has a weakness.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.800
He's going to meet
an escort tonight.

27:00.700 --> 27:02.900
Let me guess.
I'm just his type.

27:02.967 --> 27:05.800
Get him alone, we avoid
any unnecessary bloodshed.

27:05.867 --> 27:08.834
Negotiators tend to be
a little more flexible

27:08.900 --> 27:10.433
When they're the hostage.

27:10.434 --> 27:12.501
And what happens to allen king
when you get this guy?

27:14.134 --> 27:16.267
He has a daughter,
gabriel.

27:18.568 --> 27:20.501
I don't want to hurt him,
trust me,

27:20.568 --> 27:22.568
But sometimes
to do something good,

27:22.667 --> 27:24.700
We must first
do something terrible.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.767
You know
i don't have a choice.

27:26.834 --> 27:30.534
Apex has to learn
that we're serious.

27:36.301 --> 27:38.133
Anyone with a little tradecraft

27:38.134 --> 27:39.966
Knows spilling a drink
on yourself

27:39.967 --> 27:41.867
Is a common excuse
to leave a table.

27:41.900 --> 27:44.334
To convince a pro
it's truly an accident, then,

27:44.401 --> 27:46.233
You have to sell it
with more than iced tea.

27:46.234 --> 27:49.234
Woman: i'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.201
Are you all right?

27:51.501 --> 27:53.401
I should clean up.

28:05.201 --> 28:06.300
Michael?

28:06.301 --> 28:07.999
Fi, you in the hotel?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.134
It doesn't matter.
We're not staying.

28:10.201 --> 28:11.666
The hostage wasn't
at gabriel's house.

28:11.667 --> 28:12.999
Forget about the hostage.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.900
Do what you have to do,
but get out of there.

28:14.935 --> 28:16.400
He's not letting me
out of his sight

28:16.401 --> 28:18.434
Until i help kidnap an executive
from apex industries.

28:18.501 --> 28:20.700
Once i do,
he's gonna kill the hostage.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.700
How long before
he kills the hostage?

28:23.767 --> 28:25.166
About three hours.

28:25.167 --> 28:27.067
He's taking me back
to the house to change.

28:27.102 --> 28:28.333
Help me stop this.

28:28.334 --> 28:30.234
All right,
tell me what's in your bag.

28:30.301 --> 28:32.367
Hurry,
before he gets suspicious.

28:32.434 --> 28:34.934
Sunglasses, duct tape,
and lipstick.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.799
Okay,
we can work with that.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.867
I'm gonna leave you a package
at the house -

28:38.934 --> 28:41.201
Same way we used to do
the drops in dublin.

28:41.267 --> 28:43.234
I'm not gonna risk
losing you again, fi.

28:46.367 --> 28:47.966
Sam: what do we got,
a couple hours?

28:47.967 --> 28:49.967
Why don't you just let me
drop the package to fi,

28:50.034 --> 28:51.300
You see gilroy?

28:51.301 --> 28:52.966
If there's one thing
he's good at,

28:52.967 --> 28:54.599
It's getting your mind
off of things.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.500
Thanks, sam.

29:08.401 --> 29:10.767
So, should i be asking

29:10.834 --> 29:12.767
Why you're playing
with my lipstick, sam?

29:12.834 --> 29:14.632
Uh, that's sort of ntk.

29:14.633 --> 29:16.633
Oh, sorry, in civilian speak,
that's -

29:16.700 --> 29:18.565
Need to know?
Yeah.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.934
So, what? You're gonna plant
a bug on fi, right?

29:24.733 --> 29:26.733
Try this.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.433
Midnight shadows.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.933
It's got
a nice heft to it.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.667
Put something in there,
they'll never know it.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.633
Planting a surveillance device
inside an existing item

29:37.700 --> 29:39.867
Is all about working
with what you have.

29:39.934 --> 29:41.699
If the battery necessary
to power a bug is too big,

29:41.700 --> 29:43.600
You can't use it.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.967
A tracker with a ping system,
on the other hand,

29:55.034 --> 29:56.699
Can send your location
in bursts

29:56.700 --> 29:58.600
And doesn't suck
a lot of power,

29:58.633 --> 30:01.900
Making a terrific accessory
for any lady on the go.

30:14.434 --> 30:16.233
What the hell
you think you're doing?

30:16.234 --> 30:17.732
Hey, back off, curly.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.598
I'm collecting soil samples
for h.Q.

30:19.633 --> 30:21.834
Hey, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way,

30:21.900 --> 30:24.733
But we are getting to the bottom
of this crabgrass situation.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.700
No, no.
You get out of here.

30:28.568 --> 30:30.266
Michael: you know,
i thought we'd be meeting

30:30.267 --> 30:31.732
A little closer
to the airport.

30:31.733 --> 30:33.967
Still stuck on those
flight records you stole for me?

30:34.034 --> 30:35.567
Well, forget them.
Your stage is here.

30:35.568 --> 30:36.999
Tomorrow, i'll be
driving through here.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.900
Your job is to keep the road
clear of witnesses,

30:38.935 --> 30:40.533
Obstacles,
that sort of thing.

30:40.534 --> 30:42.434
I'll pick you up
at a rendezvous point,

30:42.469 --> 30:44.033
And we'll be
on our merry way.

30:44.034 --> 30:46.034
When do i get to work my magic
with the.50 cal?

30:46.101 --> 30:47.632
Oh, no.
This stays with me.

30:47.633 --> 30:50.934
I take care of anyone who
slips past you and the bridge.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.667
Of course, one prefers not to use
such things in populated areas.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.400
The rounds go for miles.

30:55.401 --> 30:56.899
Wow,
you keep me in the dark,

30:56.900 --> 30:58.500
And you hold on
to the artillery.

30:58.501 --> 31:00.501
You said i was getting
everything i needed to know today.

31:00.568 --> 31:02.066
You said we were partners.

31:02.067 --> 31:03.467
But we are, michael.

31:03.468 --> 31:05.100
I'm the partner
who tells you what to do,

31:05.101 --> 31:06.567
And you're the partner
who does it.

31:06.568 --> 31:08.834
Hilarious.
Have fun on your own.

31:10.534 --> 31:11.933
It's about a man,
an inmate.

31:11.934 --> 31:14.034
He handpicked you
for this job.

31:14.101 --> 31:16.001
I'd say he's rather obsessed
with you.

31:16.067 --> 31:17.567
His name?

31:17.568 --> 31:19.800
Sorry. He'd kill me
if i spoiled the surprise.

31:19.867 --> 31:22.800
Sorry.
Not good enough.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.300
Time for second thoughts
is over.

31:36.301 --> 31:37.866
Tomorrow,
don't come for me.

31:37.867 --> 31:40.468
Don't come for the obscene
fortune we're going to make.

31:40.534 --> 31:42.967
Come for all the people
i have to kill

31:43.034 --> 31:44.934
If you don't do your job.

31:53.967 --> 31:55.867
You'll meet the target
at the bar.

31:55.934 --> 31:57.766
He'll invite you
up to his room,

31:57.767 --> 31:59.900
At which point
you take out his guards.

31:59.967 --> 32:02.334
No guns.
Silence is golden.

32:02.401 --> 32:05.900
Me and my men will be in
afterwards to show him out.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.001
They're in position now.

32:13.867 --> 32:15.599
Sam: attagirl, fi.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.033
Her signal's coming through
loud and clear.

32:17.034 --> 32:18.934
Okay, take a right.

32:20.368 --> 32:23.368
So, gilroy has you doing
guard duty out in the boonies?

32:23.434 --> 32:25.200
At least you don't have to
hijack a plane.

32:25.201 --> 32:27.066
He must have someone else
at the airport.

32:27.067 --> 32:28.833
He wouldn't go through
all this trouble

32:28.834 --> 32:30.400
To have me babysit
some pavement.

32:30.401 --> 32:32.667
Tomorrow, i may need you
to hang around the airport

32:32.734 --> 32:34.133
With some
of your cop buddies.

32:34.134 --> 32:36.201
You got it. Ah, fi just
pinged again from the same spot.

32:36.267 --> 32:38.167
Looks like they've reached
their destination.

32:38.202 --> 32:40.234
Same hotel.

32:40.301 --> 32:42.934
Gabriel used the lunch
as a scouting trip.

32:43.001 --> 32:44.233
All right,
i'll stay in the car

32:44.234 --> 32:46.000
In case one of gabe's goons
is in there.

32:46.001 --> 32:49.301
So, any bright ideas on how
to stop gabe's next kidnapping?

32:49.368 --> 32:52.267
Figuring it out as i go,
sam.

32:52.334 --> 32:54.166
Good luck with that.

32:54.167 --> 32:57.067
Like con men, spies know
that in the workplace,

32:57.134 --> 32:59.667
A clipboard is as good
as a skeleton key.

32:59.734 --> 33:01.834
But nobody from the health
inspector's office called.

33:01.900 --> 33:04.134
What part of "surprise visit"
do you not understand?

33:04.201 --> 33:06.334
Do you want me to just shut
this place down right now?

33:06.401 --> 33:08.700
I am not gonna
sugar-Coat this.

33:08.767 --> 33:11.234
We've been getting more letters
than the north pole

33:11.301 --> 33:12.467
About this kitchen!

33:12.468 --> 33:14.033
This is not a drill!

33:14.034 --> 33:15.733
You two,
i want you to pull

33:15.734 --> 33:18.368
Every head of lettuce
from this afternoon.

33:18.434 --> 33:20.734
We find rat feces,
you find a new job.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.000
Let's go.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.866
You, i want you to go
into the freezer.

33:23.867 --> 33:26.368
I want you to find expiration
dates on all the meat.

33:26.434 --> 33:28.233
Let's move!
Let's go!

33:28.234 --> 33:29.733
I don't care who you are.

33:29.734 --> 33:31.734
You can't order the employees
to stop working

33:31.800 --> 33:33.433
Without
the manager's permission.

33:33.434 --> 33:36.334
Well, then, you should go -
You know, go get the manager.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.700
Restaurant kitchens have
grease fires all the time.

33:56.767 --> 33:58.800
A little oil on a burner, and
you can clear out a restaurant

33:58.867 --> 34:00.467
Without raising
too much suspicion

34:00.468 --> 34:01.766
Or causing too much damage.

34:03.468 --> 34:06.034
Hey, you got a grease fire
in there.

34:06.101 --> 34:08.567
Still, it's best
not to stick around too long

34:08.632 --> 34:10.498
After you've
set a kitchen on fire.

34:25.301 --> 34:27.600
We have to assume the
operation's been compromised.

34:27.667 --> 34:30.867
Compromised? It was a fire.
It's called bad luck.

34:30.934 --> 34:32.699
I don't believe
in bad luck, okay?

34:32.699 --> 34:34.600
I'm shutting this down.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.000
Leave your things here.

34:43.001 --> 34:45.067
We can't risk leaving
any evidence behind.

34:49.167 --> 34:50.933
Sam: yo, she's back
on the grid, mike.

34:50.934 --> 34:52.065
How far?

34:52.067 --> 34:53.532
About two miles.

34:53.533 --> 34:55.699
Something tells me, though,
they're not headed to the beach.

34:55.766 --> 34:58.067
Chances are he's taking her
to the hostage.

34:58.134 --> 35:00.967
Gabriel's gonna kill him
or have fi do it for him.

35:01.034 --> 35:02.934
No one guarding
your hostage?

35:03.001 --> 35:05.034
Not necessary.

35:05.101 --> 35:07.500
The most careful bad guys
don't just watch for tails

35:07.567 --> 35:09.567
And wipe off fingerprints.

35:09.633 --> 35:11.400
If you want to be extra sure
you can't be traced,

35:11.401 --> 35:13.368
You rig all the evidence
against you to go up in flames

35:13.434 --> 35:16.034
If anyone starts looking
somewhere they shouldn't.

35:19.401 --> 35:21.301
This is a sedative drip.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.434
You want to end it all, all you
do is increase the dosage.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.500
Completely painless.

35:27.567 --> 35:29.367
Another trick you learned
from your rebels?

35:29.368 --> 35:32.067
No,
this one i taught them.

35:32.134 --> 35:33.632
There's a risk in being

35:33.633 --> 35:35.767
Too obsessed
with countersurveillance.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.301
Spend your life paranoid,
always looking for threats,

35:38.368 --> 35:41.201
And it makes it easy for
someone to find them for you.

35:41.267 --> 35:43.500
Pros call it "seeing ghosts."

35:45.468 --> 35:48.401
Did you see that?
Gabriel, in the grass.

35:52.834 --> 35:54.734
Stay here.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.567
Well, this is it.

36:08.633 --> 36:11.667
Last place we got a signal.
So, where's fi?

36:19.567 --> 36:21.934
Fiona!

36:23.201 --> 36:25.101
Fiona!

36:28.101 --> 36:31.533
I'm sorry, but i cannot
let you kill an innocent man.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.600
What are you talking about,
"innocent"?

36:33.667 --> 36:35.166
My daughter
was innocent!

36:35.167 --> 36:38.368
The children his company's
killing - They're innocent!

36:38.434 --> 36:40.368
Who's protecting them,
huh?

36:40.434 --> 36:42.633
Inside. What would you
have done for claire?

36:44.034 --> 36:46.600
How far would you
have gone? Get inside.

36:46.667 --> 36:49.468
That's right,
we're the same - You and me.

36:49.533 --> 36:52.734
The only difference
are the circumstances.

36:55.434 --> 36:58.301
Tell me i'm wrong.

37:00.633 --> 37:02.133
The police
will be here soon.

37:02.134 --> 37:04.101
I can't go to jail.
You know that.

37:04.167 --> 37:07.001
Everything i worked for
will be wasted.

37:07.067 --> 37:08.933
Goodbye, gabriel.

37:08.934 --> 37:11.934
Maybe someday
- There's not going to be a someday.

37:12.001 --> 37:14.301
I only have one thing
to live for,

37:14.368 --> 37:16.767
And now that's gone!

37:19.633 --> 37:21.533
What are you doing?!

37:27.734 --> 37:29.367
Give me the key.
No!

37:29.368 --> 37:31.268
Give me the key!
Let me help you!

37:31.301 --> 37:32.966
You want to help me?

37:32.967 --> 37:35.267
Go back down to argentina
and tell them that i failed.

37:35.334 --> 37:37.267
Tell them
they're on their own.

37:38.468 --> 37:40.368
No!

37:41.167 --> 37:43.734
Go!
Get out of here!

37:48.734 --> 37:50.634
Get out of here!
Go! God damn you!

37:54.267 --> 37:55.799
Jesus.
Fi!

37:55.800 --> 37:57.934
Mike, what are you
doing? Get him clear.

37:58.001 --> 38:00.267
No, god damn it.
You're gonna suffocate in there.

38:00.334 --> 38:02.234
I'll get fi.
You get him out.

38:02.301 --> 38:04.267
If you're not out in one minute,
i'm coming in after you.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.100
Fiona,
we're going now.

38:07.101 --> 38:09.001
No, i'm not going
without him!

38:39.201 --> 38:41.101
So, the cops picked up gabriel
at the warehouse. To inclu

38:41.168 --> 38:43.134
He's looking
at some serious time.

38:43.201 --> 38:46.201
Oh, got a very interesting call
from allen king, though.

38:46.268 --> 38:48.734
He's getting files together
on apex industries,

38:48.801 --> 38:50.734
All their shenanigans
down in argentina.

38:50.801 --> 38:51.933
He's blowing the whistle?

38:51.934 --> 38:53.332
Well, fi gave him
a, uh -

38:53.333 --> 38:54.900
A talking-To.

38:54.901 --> 38:57.534
Goody bags are going out to
all the media types right now,

38:57.600 --> 39:00.534
So if i had stock in apex -
Whew - I'd sell.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.267
Hey.

39:06.268 --> 39:08.634
Brought some chicken soup
for fi.

39:08.700 --> 39:11.234
Don't worry,
i didn't make it.

39:11.300 --> 39:12.666
She's resting.

39:12.667 --> 39:15.067
Mm. Drink?

39:15.134 --> 39:17.168
Yeah.
Don't go easy on me.

39:17.234 --> 39:19.168
Ran out of cigarettes
on the way over.

39:26.101 --> 39:27.599
About that time, mike?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.767
Yeah. Mom, do you think you
can hang here for a while?

39:29.834 --> 39:31.901
The cavalry should be headed
to the airport now.

39:31.967 --> 39:33.867
Long story.
Whatever.

39:37.001 --> 39:39.001
You play nice, boys.

39:51.168 --> 39:52.933
Like new parents,

39:52.934 --> 39:54.566
Spies take
preventative measures

39:54.567 --> 39:56.467
To ensure a safe environment,

39:56.500 --> 39:58.233
Only instead
of baby-Proofing cabinets

39:58.234 --> 39:59.833
And electrical sockets,

39:59.834 --> 40:02.201
They use...
more extreme methods.

40:02.268 --> 40:05.834
When you're creating an
explosion to keep people back,

40:05.867 --> 40:07.566
You can't ||go halfw.

40:07.567 --> 40:10.234
It's never ideal,
but for their own protection,

40:10.300 --> 40:13.034
You have to make sure they know
you mean business.

40:13.101 --> 40:15.034
Then the only trick
is to set it off

40:15.101 --> 40:17.001
Without blowing anyone
to kingdom come.

40:32.433 --> 40:34.267
Yeah, sam.

40:34.268 --> 40:36.667
Mike, i've been trying to get
through for a half an hour.

40:36.734 --> 40:39.400
Looks like our plan to sic
the fbi on gilroy at the airport

40:39.467 --> 40:40.933
Is not gonna fly.

40:40.934 --> 40:43.400
A fuel truck crashed
into a cessna on the runway.

40:43.467 --> 40:45.299
They're re-Routing flights
all over florida.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.234
The cops have got this
whole area blocked off.

40:47.300 --> 40:50.101
Gilroy's not hijacking a plane.
He's diverting it.

40:50.168 --> 40:52.068
Yeah, my guess is
you're not stationed

40:52.134 --> 40:54.034
At some pass-Through
in the sticks.

40:56.901 --> 40:59.201
I'm guarding gilroy's
landing strip.

40:59.268 --> 41:00.599
Right,
and i'll tell you what.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.200
The cops are bird-Dogging
a stray plane.

41:02.201 --> 41:03.699
They're headed your way,
partner.

41:03.700 --> 41:05.033
They cross this bridge,

41:05.034 --> 41:06.566
Gilroy's gonna shred them
with his.50 cal.

41:06.567 --> 41:08.033
He's gonna pick me up
in a few minutes.

41:08.034 --> 41:09.833
You've got to tell them
to stay back until he does.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.234
What, you think the cops are
gonna take my word for it, mike?

41:15.400 --> 41:17.534
Buenos dÃ­as, mis amigos.

41:23.801 --> 41:25.100
Westen.

41:25.101 --> 41:26.966
Gilroy, hearing
lots of sirens over here.

41:26.967 --> 41:29.134
Wouldn't have anything to do
with a lost plane, would it?

41:29.201 --> 41:30.633
This is why we rehearsed.

41:30.634 --> 41:32.567
Stop your bellyaching
and do your job,

41:32.634 --> 41:34.967
Or i'll do it for you.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.600
Our guest is so keen
to meet you.

41:37.667 --> 41:40.101
See you soon, michael.

42:05.001 --> 42:07.268
Gilroy,
we need to leave now.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.967
They say if you live
long enough,

42:11.034 --> 42:12.432
You'll see everything.

42:12.433 --> 42:13.900
What happened?

42:13.901 --> 42:15.766
Paid me $10 million.

42:15.767 --> 42:18.901
Turns out his plan was
to shoot me, come after you.

42:18.967 --> 42:20.766
Who?

42:20.767 --> 42:22.167
His name is simon.

42:22.168 --> 42:24.467
Apparently i'm not his
only friend in miami.

42:26.034 --> 42:27.566
Sorry.

42:27.567 --> 42:30.034
Did i mention i'm attached
to an explosive device?

42:33.101 --> 42:34.766
Perhaps
you should run along.
