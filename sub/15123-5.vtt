WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:07.708
Oh, Shelley.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.143
I told you,

00:09.177 --> 00:11.079
if you saw bugs on her
they're just termites.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.114
You didn't need to put
her in the flea pit.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.448
Oh, no. That's
not the flea pit.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.483
The flea pit's over there.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.786
Hope's in time-out.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.188
She's doing a 30-minute stretch

00:20.221 --> 00:21.255
for hitting Jeremy.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.492
Hitting?

00:24.525 --> 00:26.260
That's not like her.

00:26.294 --> 00:29.130
Why's the dog in time-out?
Rape.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.065
Oh, I know they shouldn't be
sharing a cell,

00:31.099 --> 00:33.167
but I ran out of plastic fence.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.602
And it's not like
he raped a kid.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.204
He raped a lamp.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.272
He busted its bulb.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.507
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about Hope.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.741
She must have learned
how to fight

00:40.774 --> 00:42.243
during her first six months
in the slammer,

00:42.276 --> 00:44.712
'cause you should have seen her
kick Jeremy's ass.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.814
Next time, you'll think twice
before you snatch a tinker toy

00:46.847 --> 00:48.149
from my girl, won't you?

00:48.182 --> 00:49.750
(growls)

00:49.783 --> 00:52.253
We don't care for Jeremy;
he's a bit difficult.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.122
Jeremy's a fart face.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.628
* Whoo!

01:00.661 --> 01:03.664
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh

01:03.697 --> 01:06.800
* Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh

01:06.834 --> 01:09.703
* Birth control, no, no, no

01:09.737 --> 01:12.606
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh

01:12.640 --> 01:16.844
* Oh, oh...

01:16.877 --> 01:18.846
* Whoo!

01:18.879 --> 01:21.682
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh

01:21.715 --> 01:24.185
* Oh, oh, oh!

01:27.588 --> 01:29.757
Eat your dinner
before it melts.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.292
Popsicles and olives?

01:31.325 --> 01:32.793
Have we just given up?

01:32.826 --> 01:34.495
We can't have any
food in the house

01:34.528 --> 01:35.696
while they tent
for termites.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.431
We're eating everything
in the fridge.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.500
Maw Maw's been over
there an hour already.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.668
It's like having a goat.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.503
Oh, be careful.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.572
Apparently she's in a bit
of a mood today.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.607
She hit a kid at day care.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.741
Here we go.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.742
I told you!

01:49.943 --> 01:51.479
What?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.281
Did she really hit a kid?

01:53.314 --> 01:54.648
Yeah, she hit a kid;
kids hit kids, what?

01:55.849 --> 01:56.817
It's starting!

01:56.850 --> 01:58.219
What's starting?

01:58.252 --> 02:01.289
Jimmy, you know how
those Kardashian girls

02:01.322 --> 02:03.824
all have real big butts?

02:03.857 --> 02:06.294
Then you look at their mother,
and she's got a big butt, too?

02:07.561 --> 02:10.231
Hope's mother was
a serial killer.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.565
Oh, come on! She's a baby!

02:11.599 --> 02:13.701
John Wayne Gacy was a baby, too.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.303
And so was Ted Bundy!

02:15.336 --> 02:16.470
And remember Son of Sam?

02:16.504 --> 02:18.739
At one point,
Sam was walking around going

02:18.772 --> 02:20.608
"This is my brand-new baby."

02:20.641 --> 02:21.875
It's not just Lucy.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.944
This kid's grandparents
are whack jobs, too.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.346
They're in prison for trying
to kidnap this kid!

02:25.379 --> 02:26.814
Are they still in prison?

02:26.847 --> 02:29.183
Yeah, I see the dad
all the time on Highway 8,

02:29.217 --> 02:30.351
picking up trash
with the work crew.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.421
He looks good, but who wouldn't
look good in a jumpsuit?

02:33.454 --> 02:35.689
She just hit one kid, I'm sure
it's nothing to worry about.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.757
Finished.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.958
Good job, Maw Maw.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.360
Ah.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.295
Where's all
the refrigerator magnets?

02:41.329 --> 02:42.896
What?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.398
All those fruit-shaped magnets
that were on the freezer.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.704
Uh...

02:57.010 --> 02:59.247
(thump)

03:08.021 --> 03:09.923
(eerie music plays)

03:16.264 --> 03:18.832
OPERATOR:
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and kill again.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.644
(toy playing "Pop Goes the
Weasel")

03:43.524 --> 03:45.225
(eerie music plays)

03:54.668 --> 03:55.703
Aah!

03:55.736 --> 03:58.238
(panting)

04:16.056 --> 04:18.058
Termites, huh?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.628
Yep, poor little
wood-eating bastards.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.529
They see the tent going up,

04:21.562 --> 04:22.863
they probably think
they're at the circus.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.333
(loud laughing)

04:25.366 --> 04:27.701
Hey, give me those!

04:27.735 --> 04:30.304
I'm gonna put all the baby
stuff in the storage pod.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.573
Listen, the termite guy's gonna
turn on the gas soon.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.708
Since I'm pretty sure nothing's
gonna happen tonight,

04:34.742 --> 04:36.577
I think we got five minutes; we
can sneak inside for a quickie.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.346
Even if the termite
guy catches us,

04:38.379 --> 04:39.880
he seems very discrete.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.815
Hey, I love doing it
in tents, too.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.485
But since what usually
takes you five minutes

04:44.518 --> 04:46.554
sometimes takes me ten,
I got to pass.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.690
All right.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.759
So, you put all the furniture
the same way it was

04:51.792 --> 04:53.494
in the house.
What that really necessary?

04:53.527 --> 04:55.729
Since we're gonna be sleeping
out here for two nights,

04:55.763 --> 04:57.064
I didn't want Maw Maw
to get confused.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.333
Even on her normal nights,
she might accidentally
pee in the hamper.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.868
I'm heading to work.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.570
Uh, there's something I need
to do first.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.037
I'll see you.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.012
So, where do we go
to the bathroom?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.581
Where you always go.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.048
The bathroom!

05:15.082 --> 05:16.850
(chuckles)

05:16.884 --> 05:19.019
Damn it, Burt!
That's my good bucket!

05:19.052 --> 05:20.354
Not anymore!

05:20.388 --> 05:22.022
My... slipper's running away!

05:24.592 --> 05:25.926
(grunting)

05:32.032 --> 05:32.900
Can I help you?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.068
Uh, I need to talk
to one of the prisoners?

05:35.102 --> 05:37.137
He's my daughter's grandfather.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.672
The guy with the pigtails.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.911
Take off, son.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.913
In here, he's
nobody's grandfather.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.681
Go on! Get!

05:50.451 --> 05:53.787
Hey! Dale!

05:53.821 --> 05:55.155
Oh, hey, Jimmy, hi.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.057
How you doing?
Not so good.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.893
I'm in jail, and
as you can see by my hairstyle

05:59.927 --> 06:01.629
I've had to make
a few compromises

06:01.662 --> 06:02.830
in order to ensure my safety.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.536
Hello again.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.770
How-how's Hope?

06:09.803 --> 06:12.706
Good, good. Hey, I was wondering
if I could ask you a question.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.775
Well sure, you...

06:14.808 --> 06:17.778
Hey!
When Lucy was Hope's age,

06:17.811 --> 06:20.080
did she hit other kids?
Yeah.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.082
Then around two years old,
she started biting.

06:22.115 --> 06:26.019
And right around three,
she graduated to light stabbing.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.154
Thanks, that's all I needed!

06:36.530 --> 06:37.698
James, what are you doing?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.800
I don't know, making an animal.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.437
That's a cat. People are going
to think that's cat meat.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.205
That's 90% beef; make a cow.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.540
Sorry.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.876
Guys, what if my parents are
right?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.711
I mean, Lucy hit kids, too.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.045
What if this is the start

06:52.079 --> 06:54.081
of Hope turning into
a serial killer?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.850
That's crazy; just 'cause
Hope's mom stabbed somebody.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.018
And shot someone.
And strangled someone.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.520
And poisoned someone.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.954
Okay, we all watched the Geraldo
special,

07:00.988 --> 07:02.189
what's your point?

07:02.222 --> 07:04.157
That nurture is more
important than nature.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.193
I mean, how you raise her
is gonna make her who she is.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.162
Sabrina's right;
nurture is everything.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.532
My parents were lesbians,
but I'm not a lesbian.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.933
I do like
women, though.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.536
Oh, tricky math
on this one.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.472
But I love my parents.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.608
My dad always pushed me hard to
become an Olympic gymnast.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.943
I never made it to the Olympics,
but hey...

07:30.684 --> 07:33.487
My point is, kids react to the
environment they're raised in.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.556
Hope will be fine.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.525
Plus, it's not like
she's been exposed

07:37.558 --> 07:39.059
to a lot of violence or
conflict, right?

07:40.728 --> 07:42.830
(smoke alarm rings)
JIMMY: You burnt the
toast again?!

07:42.863 --> 07:44.665
You have to stop being
distracted by the TV!

07:44.698 --> 07:45.966
I'm sorry! That commercial

07:45.999 --> 07:48.201
for Crazy Michael's
Appliance Store was on

07:48.235 --> 07:50.137
and I can't decide
if he's an actor

07:50.170 --> 07:53.473
or if he's really
crazy-- I'm mesmerized!

07:55.876 --> 07:57.745
Stop it!

07:57.778 --> 07:58.846
(engine sputtering)

07:58.879 --> 08:02.149
Oh! My battery's
dead again.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.617
Have you been using my
headlights

08:03.651 --> 08:05.986
to practice your stupid shadow
puppets?

08:06.019 --> 08:08.121
Stupid? I found a great one last
night.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.558
What's that look like to you?

08:10.591 --> 08:13.661
It looks like an idiot who keeps
leaving my headlights on.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.962
Wrong! Moose antlers!

08:17.030 --> 08:18.766
Oh, damn it, Jimmy!

08:18.799 --> 08:19.933
You're a grown man.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.602
When are you gonna stop
spilling drinks?

08:21.635 --> 08:22.736
Ow!

08:22.770 --> 08:25.906
Ow.
Ow!

08:25.939 --> 08:27.140
I got to go.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.709
James?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.882
Can I get three pounds
of the cat?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.088
So, no more arguing,
no more fighting.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.322
Nothing.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.324
Look, Jimmy, I'm all
for making sure

08:44.357 --> 08:45.292
she doesn't murder
us one day.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.994
But why
worry now?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.162
She's still got that
big soft spot on her head.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.198
It's like
an emergency kill switch.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.833
You know what
babies are like.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.902
One day they're crawling,
next day they're walking.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.637
One day they can't even use
a spoon.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.905
The next day,
they're stabbing you.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.975
He's right.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.044
She can walk now,
she can pick stuff up.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.045
Those are
the two most important things

09:05.078 --> 09:07.014
you need to know how to do
to kill somebody.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.183
As long as we show her that
people should be kind,

09:10.217 --> 09:12.620
keep everything peaceful,
and don't raise our voices...

09:12.653 --> 09:14.154
I think we'll be okay.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.889
BURT:
We can't let our guard down.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.324
I love her, but I'm gonna sleep
with one eye open

09:17.357 --> 09:18.926
till she moves out
of this house.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.795
And in this family, that could
be a long, long time.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.832
Virginia!

09:24.865 --> 09:27.601
Did you bring my guitar out
like I asked?

09:27.635 --> 09:29.136
No, I was going to,
but that

09:29.169 --> 09:31.705
Crazy Mike commercial
came on, and I got sucked in.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.641
I swear, if
that guy doesn't

09:33.674 --> 09:36.610
really have Tourette's,
he's freaking DeNiro.
Virginia!

09:36.644 --> 09:37.878
I told you I wanted to play

09:37.911 --> 09:38.979
around the campfire!
I can't believe this!

09:39.012 --> 09:40.347
Shh!

09:41.715 --> 09:44.752
Okeydokey!

09:44.785 --> 09:46.687
I'll go get it!

09:46.720 --> 09:48.288
Whoa-whoah! You're not
going in there, are you?

09:48.321 --> 09:49.657
What about
the chemicals?

09:49.690 --> 09:51.124
I'll hold my breath
and close my eyes.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.125
It'll be like
eating Indian food.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.829
(inhales)

10:18.886 --> 10:20.788
(gasps)

10:28.161 --> 10:30.330
I got it!

10:30.363 --> 10:31.799
That's a lamp.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.068
What did I go in there for?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.136
A guitar.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.173
(sighs, inhales)

10:44.244 --> 10:45.979
(grunts)

10:46.013 --> 10:47.981
(playing rhythm of "If You're
Happy and You Know It")

10:48.015 --> 10:49.783
* There's a skeeter
on my peter *

10:49.817 --> 10:51.151
* Get it off

10:51.184 --> 10:53.120
(coughs)

10:53.153 --> 10:54.822
* There's a dozen
on my cousin *

10:54.855 --> 10:56.323
* You can hear the
suckers buzzin' *

10:56.356 --> 10:59.459
(coughing)

10:59.492 --> 11:03.463
(sighs):
I could get used to
a world without roofs.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.733
I love the fresh air.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.267
And I hate roofers.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.704
(thunder rumbles)

11:10.738 --> 11:12.472
Rain!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.474
Burt, did you check the weather?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.409
No, I did not.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.796
Hey!

11:35.829 --> 11:36.930
I moved everything
I could

11:36.964 --> 11:39.266
into the cars
to make room in here.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.369
My pickup has the clothes,
Jimmy's van has the food.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.337
And Virginia's got
junk in her trunk.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.973
(laughs):
Hey! Junk in the trunk!

11:46.006 --> 11:47.174
I just got that.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.241
You good,
Maw Maw?

11:48.275 --> 11:52.412
Train travel-- it's
the only way to see America.

11:52.445 --> 11:56.316
Okay, well... we're
going through a tunnel!

11:56.349 --> 11:58.251
VIRGINIA:
Okay, well, I'm going
out to the van

11:58.285 --> 11:59.920
to get some food.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.388
It's pretty dark
out there.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.857
So, for dinner tonight we're
either having flank steak,

12:03.891 --> 12:05.793
or floor mats.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.467
(man whooping wildly over TV)

12:18.305 --> 12:20.507
So come on down...
(making zany noises)

12:24.978 --> 12:28.248
Do any of you butt lumps need
a damn clock radio?

12:28.281 --> 12:31.051
I need one,
I need at least three!

12:31.084 --> 12:34.054
I need three to control my mind!
Whoo! (crazy laugh)

12:34.087 --> 12:36.489
* Clock radio!

12:36.523 --> 12:39.927
Want to buy a DVD? (honking)

12:39.960 --> 12:42.295
Ron Paul for President.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.999
What are you?

12:46.033 --> 12:47.901
Living in these pods
isn't so bad.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.003
I wonder what poor people do
when their houses get tented

12:50.037 --> 12:51.872
and they have no place to live.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.141
This is what poor people do;
we're poor.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.977
Still, it's not so bad.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.411
Aah!

12:58.445 --> 12:59.813
Oh, crap!

12:59.847 --> 13:02.515
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

13:02.549 --> 13:03.984
Whoo!

13:04.017 --> 13:05.986
Whoo-whoo! (gasping)

13:08.555 --> 13:09.857
Whoah!

13:09.890 --> 13:12.459
Whoah, yourself, sock-burner!

13:12.492 --> 13:14.527
Sorry, I got distracted
by the neighbor's TV.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.963
Aw, you're always
doing that!

13:15.996 --> 13:17.297
It's like you have ADD.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.866
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

13:18.899 --> 13:20.567
Not in front
of the anger sponge.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.273
Look at us,
being affectionate.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.108
and not murdering each other.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.010
This is the norm.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.921
Ow.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.156
Where you going?

13:43.190 --> 13:45.158
Going to the gas
station to potty.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.460
Just try the bucket chair,
just to say you did it.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.362
Why would I want
to say that?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.899
Got to go, got to go,
got to go-go-go.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.101
Got to go, got to go, got to go!

13:54.134 --> 13:56.003
Got to go! Got to go! Got to go!

13:56.036 --> 13:58.371
Okay, I'm gonna go.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.340
I'm going.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.409
(sighs)

14:02.442 --> 14:05.112
(engine sputters)
No, no, no.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.280
No! No! Aah!

14:07.314 --> 14:11.084
Did you leave the lights
on in my car last night?

14:11.118 --> 14:12.419
Uh, maybe.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.454
Damn it! The battery's dead

14:14.487 --> 14:16.356
and the other cars are
too full to drive!

14:16.389 --> 14:18.458
Ah, dat, dat, dat...
Baby's awake.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.430
Hey, hon!
Hi, pumpkin!

14:23.463 --> 14:26.333
(groaning)
Ah, oooh.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.274
(panting)

14:34.307 --> 14:38.078
Ahh...

14:41.014 --> 14:42.149
Boo-ya!

14:49.022 --> 14:51.959
Take a picture,
it'll last longer!

14:53.593 --> 14:54.694
Hey!

14:54.727 --> 14:56.429
Wait! Hey, you!

14:56.463 --> 15:00.100
Technically, with my head just
over the steering wheel,

15:00.133 --> 15:02.135
I can see a good part of the
side view mirror

15:02.169 --> 15:03.570
from the reflection
in my windshield

15:03.603 --> 15:04.938
that was reflecting
off the empty aquarium

15:04.972 --> 15:06.940
in the passenger seat.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.475
You need an unobstructed view.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.243
And did I mention
the reflection in the aquarium?

15:10.277 --> 15:12.379
Look, if you want to live out of
your van, that's your business.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.513
But don't drive it around.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.182
I don't live in the van.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.284
Actually, currently I live in
the storage pod,

15:17.317 --> 15:19.386
(laughs):
which is a funny story.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.288
Because I have
termites, and...

15:21.321 --> 15:23.290
You're still writing me
that ticket.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.525
Okay, well, that is good

15:25.558 --> 15:27.460
because it gives
me another chance

15:27.494 --> 15:30.263
to practice my maturity and my
ability to not get mad,

15:30.297 --> 15:32.399
even though I am now
very late for work.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.533
So...

15:33.566 --> 15:36.103
thank you, all's dandy!

15:40.540 --> 15:43.676
("Under Pressure" plays)

15:43.710 --> 15:48.215
* Pressure, pushing down on me

15:48.248 --> 15:52.519
* Pressing down on you,
no man asks for *

15:52.552 --> 15:56.656
* Under pressure,
that brings a building down *
(sneezes)

15:56.689 --> 16:01.461
* Splits a family in two,
puts people on streets *

16:01.494 --> 16:04.431
* Um ba ba be, um ba ba be...

16:05.698 --> 16:09.136
Two hundred dollars?!

16:09.169 --> 16:12.272
Where the hell am I going to get
that kind of money, man?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.373
I mean...

16:13.406 --> 16:15.275
I pay for food
when I get hungry!

16:15.308 --> 16:17.610
I don't just get to go to the
restaurant and eat for free

16:17.644 --> 16:20.013
because of some stupid badge on
my shirt!

16:20.047 --> 16:21.281
Say what you want about me,

16:21.314 --> 16:22.749
but please don't
disrespect the badge.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.118
Why don't you use your badge to
catch some real criminals?

16:25.152 --> 16:29.156
You idiot! You ridiculous,
stupid idiot!

16:29.189 --> 16:32.425
Sir, pick that up, or I'll have
to cite you for littering.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.062
Littering? Seriously?
You want to see littering?

16:35.095 --> 16:37.264
I'm gonna make it rain, bitch!

16:37.297 --> 16:40.600
Whoo! How you gonna give a
ticket without your ticket book?

16:40.633 --> 16:43.636
You stupid beeaaa...

16:43.670 --> 16:45.605
(stun gun clicking)
(gurgling)

16:53.680 --> 16:55.548
Well, I can't reach my parents,

16:55.582 --> 16:58.551
but, uh, my friend says she can
pick me up around dinner.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.221
So, do I just sit
around here all day?

17:01.254 --> 17:04.557
Oh, no.
Since the state budget cuts,

17:04.591 --> 17:07.227
no one gets to just sit around.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.599
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

17:12.632 --> 17:14.634
You know, I'm just glad Hope
wasn't there to see it.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.668
I really lost my temper.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.106
Right, you never want to
let a child see you upset.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.508
Exactly. That's a whole thing
we're working on at the house.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.512
Well, kudos. We made a point
never to argue in front of Lucy.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.616
Really? You
never argued?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.118
I figured you
guys argued a lot

17:31.151 --> 17:33.153
and that's what
made Lucy violent.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.289
Hey, ese, I found
your underwear.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.529
It's very important
for a child's environment

17:42.562 --> 17:44.231
that the role models
around them

17:44.264 --> 17:46.299
make a consistent and
conspicuous effort

17:46.333 --> 17:47.700
to keep calm.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.637
That's right, you
don't wear underwear.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.539
'Cause you're
a baby!

17:52.572 --> 17:54.474
And here's your
dirty diaper.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.744
That's it!
I'm done!

17:57.777 --> 17:59.679
Race war!

18:03.516 --> 18:04.517
(grunting and groaning)

18:04.551 --> 18:06.153
Hit him, not me, estupido!

18:08.288 --> 18:10.190
(grunting)

18:14.327 --> 18:16.463
JIMMY:
And then he says,
they never argued

18:16.496 --> 18:18.231
at all around Lucy, and
she wasn't allowed

18:18.265 --> 18:19.299
to argue, either.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.201
Which is probably why,
later in life,

18:21.234 --> 18:22.569
when she had a conflict with
someone,

18:22.602 --> 18:24.737
she stuck an ice-pick
in their eye.
And neck.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.340
And ear. Man, I wish we'd taped
that Geraldo special.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.741
JIMMY:
But the point is,

18:28.775 --> 18:30.410
you have to let off steam.
Right.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.744
It's like when you stick a cork

18:31.778 --> 18:33.213
in one of those cartoon
tea-kettles.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.582
Yes. You get fat, red,
angry and explode.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.616
I mean, that's what happened
to me today.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.885
If we're not careful,
it'll happen to all of us.

18:38.918 --> 18:42.355
Actually, I had a little bit
of an incident myself today.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.473
(metallic screeching)

19:09.716 --> 19:12.952
I might've lost my temper
a little today, too.

19:12.985 --> 19:13.886
I want a fish dog.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.189
No onions, extra pickle.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.326
Onions and pickle.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.661
No onions. Extra pickle.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.230
On a fish dog.

19:23.263 --> 19:26.233
Extra pickle. No onions. Hm?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.669
Ah.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.874
Huh.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.979
No onions, extra pickles?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.982
Virginia, I think I got yours!

19:43.015 --> 19:44.884
Yeah, I was embarrassed,
but at the same time,

19:44.917 --> 19:46.653
I was pretty impressed
that I still fit

19:46.686 --> 19:48.221
through
the drive-through window.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.822
It's not that impressive,
considering the first time

19:49.856 --> 19:51.424
you did it, you were
pregnant with Jimmy.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.494
(laughing)

19:54.527 --> 19:56.463
JIMMY:
You put any four people
in a house together,

19:56.496 --> 19:57.930
and they're gonna argue
a little.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.833
When you throw in the fact that
they do stupid things,

20:00.867 --> 20:03.270
over and over again,

20:03.303 --> 20:05.538
they're gonna argue a lot.

20:05.572 --> 20:08.275
But the good thing about
arguing is it lets you get out

20:08.308 --> 20:11.010
all the bad so you can make
room for the good.

20:11.043 --> 20:11.978
(alarm stops)

20:12.011 --> 20:18.685
(chuckling)

20:18.718 --> 20:21.888
It's not that important
whether or not you get mad,

20:21.921 --> 20:23.890
'cause you're probably gonna.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.593
What's important is
what you do afterwards.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.928
So, you're gonna see us argue
from time to time.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.364
But you're also gonna see
us laugh.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.334
'Cause a lot of families might
argue less than we do,

20:34.367 --> 20:36.903
but no family laughs more
than we do.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.539
And don't worry about all that
serial killer stuff.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.542
I don't think, deep down,
anyone really thinks

20:42.575 --> 20:45.645
that you're gonna kill us.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.780
Did you lock
the bedroom door?

20:47.814 --> 20:48.881
Damn right,
I did.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.320
Thank you for watching
Raising Hope on Fox.
