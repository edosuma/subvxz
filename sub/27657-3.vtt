00:43.765 --> 00:44.725
Mum!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.565
Wake up!

00:46.645 --> 00:48.885
Mildred, what are you doing in my room?

00:49.645 --> 00:51.245
We're not in your room.

00:54.365 --> 00:56.565
Mildred! Get me down now!

00:56.805 --> 00:58.405
I didn't get you up.

00:58.485 --> 00:59.325
You did.

01:02.645 --> 01:03.485
Okay.

01:03.565 --> 01:05.405
Maybe you need a broomstick.

01:09.125 --> 01:10.125
{\an8}Woah!

01:10.965 --> 01:13.445
{\an8}I don't know how you did that Mum,
but it was amazing.

01:14.125 --> 01:15.045
Oh!

01:15.565 --> 01:18.805
{\an8}You must have been dreaming about
being outside and your magic did the rest.

01:18.885 --> 01:21.525
{\an8}What?
What are you talking about, my magic?

01:21.605 --> 01:22.965
I turned you into a witch, Mum.

01:23.285 --> 01:24.445
You what?

01:24.525 --> 01:26.765
Like you were always meant to be.
Isn't it brilliant?

01:27.325 --> 01:30.845
{\an8}I've just fallen out of the sky, Mildred,
I do not call that brilliant.

01:31.285 --> 01:32.205
Oh!

01:33.565 --> 01:36.805
Since when could people
get turned into witches anyway?

01:37.205 --> 01:38.885
I don't want it. Turn me back.

01:46.645 --> 01:51.445
Witches may work in many roles,
such as animal witching, science witching,

01:52.285 --> 01:56.125
some other witching,
where a green blob is covering the words.

01:56.205 --> 01:58.205
How old is your <i> Witches Code</i>, Bea?

01:58.845 --> 02:00.285
Mum got it for me when I was a baby.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.805
Tell her you're due a new one then.

02:02.885 --> 02:04.045
I like that one.

02:05.085 --> 02:08.205
I have no idea what type of witch
I want to be when I leave here.

02:08.604 --> 02:10.205
That's why we're having
this careers lesson.

02:10.285 --> 02:11.765
Me, I'm already decided.

02:15.965 --> 02:18.605
Miss Tapioca? Do you have any
cinnamon?

02:26.325 --> 02:27.405
Any what?

02:27.485 --> 02:32.885
It's just that I have some on mine
at home, maybe some fruit, chopped nuts.

02:32.965 --> 02:35.725
Ooh, sounds wonderful.

02:35.805 --> 02:39.685
Maybe you can come in sometime
and share some recipe tips.

02:40.245 --> 02:41.405
Oh, well, if you really think--

02:41.485 --> 02:44.405
Or maybe, you'll eat what you're given...

02:44.485 --> 02:46.405
before I turn you into a jelly.

02:47.765 --> 02:48.925
Without cinnamon.

02:50.565 --> 02:51.405
Eat.

02:52.645 --> 02:54.885
And you can clear off and all,

02:54.965 --> 02:56.645
you're always in here. Out!

02:57.165 --> 02:58.605
Clarice? Clarice!

02:58.685 --> 03:00.205
I've come for the wishing star.

03:00.525 --> 03:02.725
You did get it like we agreed,
didn't you, Clarice?

03:02.805 --> 03:03.685
Clarice!

03:06.525 --> 03:07.365
Hi, Ethel.

03:08.365 --> 03:09.285
Clarice!

03:27.005 --> 03:28.565
Do you want the good news or the bad
news?

03:28.645 --> 03:30.885
Why do I think the correct answer
is none of the news?

03:30.965 --> 03:34.005
Bad, I sort of stole the wishing star.

03:34.085 --> 03:35.325
-What, Millie?
-Good...

03:35.805 --> 03:37.205
I turned my mum into a witch.

03:38.845 --> 03:41.805
Which she is struggling with at the
moment, but she's a complete natural.

03:41.885 --> 03:45.125
I mean, she was levitating
without a spell or a potion, or anything.

03:46.645 --> 03:47.685
Amazing or what?

03:48.805 --> 03:50.765
So, you want to cook, Beatrice?

03:50.845 --> 03:53.765
An unusual career choice.
What got you interested in that?

03:54.645 --> 03:56.205
Well, because...

03:56.845 --> 03:58.005
No real reason.

03:58.685 --> 04:00.605
Okay, but, if you're keen,

04:00.685 --> 04:03.045
I could organize
something special for you.

04:03.605 --> 04:04.765
Special, Miss Drill?

04:04.845 --> 04:08.205
How about a day's work experience
in the kitchens?

04:08.765 --> 04:10.325
The school kitchens?

04:10.405 --> 04:12.885
Of course! Miss Tapioca could use a hand.

04:12.965 --> 04:15.165
You two are going to get on
like a cauldron on fire.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.805
-Well, what are you waiting for?
-Oh.

04:22.725 --> 04:24.205
Where's my <i> Witches Code</i> ?

04:24.284 --> 04:26.205
You haven't had it out in class.

04:26.284 --> 04:27.525
It's not here.

04:27.805 --> 04:29.165
You needed a new one anyway.

04:29.245 --> 04:30.685
I need to find that one!

04:31.365 --> 04:33.165
You must have left it in the dining hall.

04:33.525 --> 04:36.245
I put it in my bag.
I definitely put it in my bag.

04:38.085 --> 04:39.965
It's a book.

04:40.045 --> 04:41.165
What's the big deal?

04:55.365 --> 04:56.245
Hey!

04:56.765 --> 04:58.485
You are out of bounds!

04:59.365 --> 05:02.045
I'm here for work experience.
Miss Drill sent me.

05:02.125 --> 05:04.525
Like I've got time to waste
on training you.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.885
I have a thousand mouths to feed.

05:08.965 --> 05:10.405
Cinnamon girl!

05:11.285 --> 05:14.085
Uh, yes, Mrs Tapioca.

05:15.085 --> 05:16.565
Was anything handed in today?

05:16.645 --> 05:18.005
It's just that, I lost a book and I--

05:18.085 --> 05:19.925
If it gets handed in, it goes in the bin.

05:20.005 --> 05:21.085
That's my motto.

05:22.245 --> 05:23.205
Well, can I check the bin--

05:23.285 --> 05:25.885
If you're here to work for me, get to it.
Kitchens.

05:29.045 --> 05:31.245
So, the idea is,

05:32.325 --> 05:37.885
that between us we'll make
a sculpture of the whole academy.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.645
What for, Miss Hubble?

05:40.685 --> 05:43.085
Well, I thought it would be
a good idea for you

05:43.165 --> 05:45.885
to view your world
from a fresh perspective.

05:47.165 --> 05:50.845
It's useful for everyone to take a good,
hard look at themselves,

05:50.925 --> 05:52.085
every now and again.

05:53.405 --> 05:55.245
As I say, struggling.

05:58.205 --> 05:59.885
You do realize this is madness.

06:00.365 --> 06:03.325
If anyone finds out what you've done,
you'll be up before the Great Wizard.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.445
May I say Ms Hubble,

06:06.525 --> 06:10.805
that when Miss Cackle chose
to exclude me from normal activities,

06:10.885 --> 06:13.085
until I finish this long essay for you,

06:13.805 --> 06:18.125
I had no idea that I would be missing out
on such a wonderful project.

06:18.205 --> 06:19.325
Thank you, Ethel.

06:20.885 --> 06:22.685
Is that the dining hall you've made?

06:23.245 --> 06:25.005
Only I think I see you inside it.

06:25.965 --> 06:27.565
Sitting, on your own.

06:31.085 --> 06:31.925
My essay!

06:32.925 --> 06:33.765
Who did that?

06:39.485 --> 06:40.445
Yes, Mum!

06:40.525 --> 06:41.925
People are going to realize.

06:42.005 --> 06:45.685
The worst that's going to happen is Mum's
going to realize how cool this is.

06:48.965 --> 06:51.245
I'll give you some advice
about becoming a cook.

06:51.725 --> 06:52.605
Don't bother.

06:52.925 --> 06:53.765
Oh.

06:53.845 --> 06:56.925
Oh, it's a great job
if you want to be insulted,

06:57.005 --> 06:59.685
ignored, unappreciated,

06:59.765 --> 07:03.645
undervalued, underpaid, insulted.

07:03.725 --> 07:05.285
You already said insulted.

07:07.325 --> 07:09.805
Or, it was just my mistake.

07:10.765 --> 07:12.525
I've got lunches to prepare.

07:12.885 --> 07:16.245
Miss Tapioca, it's really important to me
to find that <i> Witches Code</i>.

07:16.325 --> 07:18.005
I think someone took it from my bag.

07:18.085 --> 07:19.925
It's not my fault if you can't
look after your things.

07:20.005 --> 07:21.405
But you don't understand.

07:22.725 --> 07:24.925
Oh, I understand that you need

07:25.005 --> 07:27.805
to learn what it's really like
in the kitchens.

07:28.485 --> 07:32.205
It's not all baking pretty little cakes
at home with mummy.

07:34.085 --> 07:36.125
You get to organize my cookery books.

07:45.325 --> 07:46.925
And do not touch the food.

07:57.325 --> 07:58.205
Ugh.

08:03.965 --> 08:07.485
"Lost! Potion set,
last seen in dining hall."

08:09.965 --> 08:13.845
"Lost chanting sheets,
gone missing from dining hall."

08:14.525 --> 08:16.045
I hope you're busy tidying.

08:17.405 --> 08:18.605
There <i> is</i> a thief.

08:22.725 --> 08:25.165
<i>"Advanced Magical Baking."</i>

08:26.765 --> 08:29.685
Try to look at the school
with fresh eyes, girls.

08:29.765 --> 08:30.885
What do you see?

08:30.965 --> 08:34.605
A magical academy,
where pupils go to learn magic.

08:34.684 --> 08:35.684
Ethel.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.885
Oh, Ms Hubble, do forgive me.

08:38.645 --> 08:40.365
I just wanted to say out loud

08:40.445 --> 08:42.924
that you have fully changed my opinion

08:43.005 --> 08:45.765
about the value of art in Cackle's,

08:46.445 --> 08:50.005
with this superbly conceived
and utterly stimulating project.

08:53.645 --> 08:54.605
What?

08:58.245 --> 08:59.085
Oh.

10:01.965 --> 10:02.885
What's that?

10:03.485 --> 10:04.405
I-I...

10:06.165 --> 10:08.525
found a jar of cinnamon, Miss Tapioca.

10:08.605 --> 10:09.885
I threw it out, immediately.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.165
It's nearly lunch.

10:13.965 --> 10:14.965
Come and help.

10:22.645 --> 10:24.045
Truth cookies.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.605
Just leave your stuff
on your desks, girls.

10:29.685 --> 10:31.285
We can finish off next time.

10:35.445 --> 10:37.325
I suppose she's told you what she's done?

10:37.405 --> 10:41.605
I can't trust myself to think anything.
Stuff just happens.

10:42.885 --> 10:44.725
I don't think your mum's up for this, Mil.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.805
You just have to train yourself, Mum.

10:46.885 --> 10:47.765
Like I did.

10:50.005 --> 10:51.965
You're not getting how awesome this is.

10:53.405 --> 10:54.205
Look.

10:54.285 --> 10:57.525
Without magic,
you have to follow the laws of nature.

11:00.725 --> 11:03.565
With magic, the laws of nature follow you.

11:05.245 --> 11:07.085
Ear of barley, husk of rye,

11:07.685 --> 11:09.645
clay, do what's in my mind's eye.

11:15.885 --> 11:16.725
Our flat.

11:17.645 --> 11:18.605
You'll learn to control it.

11:19.245 --> 11:20.165
And what do I do till then?

11:20.245 --> 11:21.765
Stay locked in the art cupboard?

11:22.605 --> 11:23.845
Coming for a cuppa?

11:23.925 --> 11:26.125
It's my birthday
and I've brought cake in...

11:26.205 --> 11:28.205
Which means I won't take no for an answer.

11:29.045 --> 11:29.885
Lovely.

11:33.725 --> 11:35.325
What could possibly go wrong?

11:40.365 --> 11:43.885
What Miss Hardbroom said
about you not eating at our table,

11:44.445 --> 11:46.445
the rest of us don't hold with that
by the way.

11:46.925 --> 11:48.325
Right. Thanks.

11:48.405 --> 11:50.325
You're always welcome to sit with us.

11:51.245 --> 11:54.005
Well, if you want to sit
by someone who eats flies for lunch.

11:54.085 --> 11:56.445
I am starving.

11:57.725 --> 11:59.405
Ooh, no.

12:01.405 --> 12:02.245
Where are my flies?

12:03.925 --> 12:06.125
How very odd, Algernon.

12:08.045 --> 12:09.205
Ms Hubble?

12:09.285 --> 12:12.365
You have not filed your attendance records
this morning.

12:12.445 --> 12:15.165
May I remind you that these
are to be provided

12:15.245 --> 12:16.765
for every lesson.

12:19.885 --> 12:21.165
Ms Hubble?

12:21.805 --> 12:24.845
Have I turned invisible?

12:26.445 --> 12:30.605
Am I speaking in a foreign tongue?

12:33.325 --> 12:35.085
See that you file them this afternoon.

12:41.005 --> 12:41.885
Too close.

12:58.885 --> 13:00.285
How do you like the truth cookies?

13:01.005 --> 13:03.125
Once you eat one, you literally can't lie.

13:03.205 --> 13:05.645
Which is how I'm going to find out
who stole my book.

13:05.725 --> 13:07.045
Stole it?

13:07.125 --> 13:09.725
Honestly, why is she so hung up
on that thing?

13:11.685 --> 13:12.645
I have to go,

13:12.725 --> 13:14.645
because I'm a coward
who hates confrontation.

13:14.725 --> 13:16.885
Tell Beatrice her cookies totally work.

13:17.765 --> 13:19.525
Clarice? Clarice!

13:22.645 --> 13:23.765
The teachers haven't come in.

13:24.525 --> 13:25.765
What if something's happened?

13:25.845 --> 13:29.325
That's what we've been telling you.
You need to fix your mum, fast.

13:29.405 --> 13:32.325
Do you two know anything
about items being stolen?

13:32.405 --> 13:33.405
Yes.

13:35.885 --> 13:40.165
Well, things get stolen all the time
like, money, jewelry, cars.

13:42.245 --> 13:43.245
Don't!

13:44.005 --> 13:45.525
These must be truth cookies.

13:45.605 --> 13:47.125
You'll blow the secret.

13:47.205 --> 13:48.045
What secret?

13:48.445 --> 13:49.725
She...

13:49.805 --> 13:50.885
She...

13:51.925 --> 13:53.405
-She stole the wish--
-Oi!

13:53.925 --> 13:54.805
You!

13:54.885 --> 13:57.165
Those dishes
are not going to wash themselves.

13:57.485 --> 13:59.405
Well, they could actually,
it's a magic school.

13:59.485 --> 14:01.085
But I want you to do it.

14:03.765 --> 14:05.005
Let's get out of here.

14:16.885 --> 14:19.805
So, there was magic in the cookies,

14:19.885 --> 14:21.485
and now you can only tell the truth.

14:21.565 --> 14:22.685
Yes, and I really hope

14:22.765 --> 14:24.845
you don't ask me what I think
about your recent behavior.

14:26.085 --> 14:28.205
What do you think
about my recent behavior?

14:28.885 --> 14:30.365
You're like a different person.

14:30.445 --> 14:32.485
Stealing the wishing star, that's not you.

14:32.565 --> 14:33.965
If you don't see sense
to reverse the spell,

14:34.045 --> 14:35.845
I'm not even sure I can stay friends
with you.

14:35.925 --> 14:37.525
Enid feels the same way.

14:39.085 --> 14:40.725
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.445
How do I reverse the spell?

14:51.925 --> 14:53.565
Wonderful work today.

14:53.645 --> 14:56.205
You've got the makings of a fine cook.

14:56.285 --> 14:58.725
-Really?
-No. You were a disgrace.

14:59.445 --> 15:02.605
"Don't touch the food," I said,
but you knew better.

15:03.085 --> 15:05.685
You knew how to improve my menu.

15:05.765 --> 15:07.365
No, Miss Tapioca, that's not why--

15:07.445 --> 15:10.285
These... are not fit to eat.

15:10.925 --> 15:12.285
And you aim to be a cook?

15:13.245 --> 15:15.085
You've got a lot to learn
if you want to be like me.

15:15.925 --> 15:17.285
Why would I want to be like you?

15:17.965 --> 15:19.405
I want to be a cook like my mum.

15:20.645 --> 15:23.645
Well, I shall be calling your mum
on the magic mirror

15:23.725 --> 15:26.205
to tell her
that you're not actually cut out for co--

15:26.285 --> 15:27.125
You can't.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.445
We lost my mum.

15:30.325 --> 15:31.485
Six years ago now.

15:33.005 --> 15:34.485
You should have said something.

15:34.565 --> 15:37.005
I don't. Not even to my friends.

15:37.805 --> 15:39.685
Because everyone has all these questions

15:39.765 --> 15:42.245
and it's like I have to
go through it again and again.

15:42.325 --> 15:44.165
So I just pretend she's still around.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.325
Well...

15:46.765 --> 15:48.085
you can't expect me to--

15:48.165 --> 15:50.205
And do you know what made me feel
like she was around?

15:50.285 --> 15:51.365
My <i> Witches Code</i>.

15:51.445 --> 15:54.325
The one my mum bought for me,
and now I don't even have that.

16:01.245 --> 16:03.445
I didn't know it would be so hard
to find a reversal spell.

16:04.165 --> 16:06.885
Non-magical people don't turn magical
every day, Millie.

16:07.645 --> 16:09.205
I'm really grateful
that you're helping me.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.125
Especially knowing how you both feel.

16:13.525 --> 16:17.165
If there was a reversal spell for the way
I've been behaving, I'd use it.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.085
Wait, I think this is it.

16:21.845 --> 16:25.085
The spell must be cast willingly
by the one who is giving up her magic.

16:25.725 --> 16:27.645
If the non-magical person
does not give up their magic

16:27.725 --> 16:29.725
then consequences will ensure,
such as...

16:30.565 --> 16:31.845
Such as what?

16:33.205 --> 16:34.405
The next page is missing.

16:35.445 --> 16:38.325
If we get this done quick,
we won't have to worry, will we?

16:38.405 --> 16:41.165
Either way it'll end in total disaster.
Knowing you, Millie.

16:44.165 --> 16:45.605
When do these cookies wear off?

16:47.525 --> 16:48.405
Finished.

16:48.685 --> 16:49.885
Thank you, Ethel.

16:50.965 --> 16:52.885
"What I love about being a witch."

16:53.325 --> 16:54.485
Sounds interesting.

16:54.845 --> 16:56.845
It is. I wrote it.

16:58.845 --> 17:01.445
"Most of all what I love
about being a witch

17:01.525 --> 17:06.765
is that the good you can do for the world
is only limited by your imagination."

17:08.085 --> 17:09.405
That's beautiful, Ethel.

17:10.124 --> 17:11.724
I was stuck for an ending.

17:18.045 --> 17:19.005
Beautiful.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.725
Ear of barley,

17:33.405 --> 17:34.485
husk of rye,

17:35.405 --> 17:38.365
clay, do what's in my mind's eye.

18:06.765 --> 18:08.445
Whoo!

18:09.685 --> 18:10.525
Mum?

18:14.805 --> 18:15.725
Who is...

18:17.085 --> 18:18.405
Help!

18:20.205 --> 18:21.245
Mum!

18:21.765 --> 18:22.965
Help!

18:23.045 --> 18:24.885
Mum, I'm coming! Hang on!

18:25.125 --> 18:25.965
Mildred!

18:27.365 --> 18:28.245
Oh!

18:31.005 --> 18:33.085
The wishing star. Give it to me.

18:33.565 --> 18:34.925
I-I didn't take it.

18:35.245 --> 18:38.885
Then you will go back there now
and complete the task as agreed.

18:38.965 --> 18:41.125
It's wrong. No matter what you say.

18:41.845 --> 18:42.845
Well.

18:42.925 --> 18:45.125
What a missed opportunity for you.

18:46.005 --> 18:47.805
I thought you were a high achieving witch.

18:47.885 --> 18:49.125
I was mistaken.

18:49.765 --> 18:51.365
I'll just have to do it myself.

18:53.845 --> 18:55.645
I should not have had that cookie.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.485
I just saw Bea running out
of the dining hall. She looked upset.

19:01.605 --> 19:03.165
Mum, you were right.

19:03.245 --> 19:06.445
This was a bad idea,
one of the worst ideas I've ever had.

19:06.525 --> 19:07.365
I flew!

19:07.565 --> 19:10.205
I really flew!

19:13.485 --> 19:14.565
Miss Cackle?

19:33.965 --> 19:35.405
It's not here.

19:36.405 --> 19:37.805
What's not here?

19:42.485 --> 19:43.645
Hi, Star.

19:45.965 --> 19:46.805
Bea.

19:49.845 --> 19:52.165
My <i> Witches Code</i>, it's gone for good.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.885
That's not worth all this upset.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.125
Your mother can buy you another one.

19:58.285 --> 20:00.325
What's so special about that book anyway?

20:01.245 --> 20:02.085
Star, no!

20:04.245 --> 20:05.605
Did he just eat a truth cookie?

20:06.645 --> 20:09.005
What happens
when a dog eats a truth cookie?

20:09.485 --> 20:11.005
He starts barking more honestly?

20:12.365 --> 20:15.885
Wait. He was in the dining hall.

20:16.205 --> 20:19.365
He's always in the dining hall.
He knows who the thief is.

20:19.445 --> 20:20.485
Don't you, boy?

20:21.085 --> 20:23.205
Come on, Star. Show us who the thief is.

20:23.285 --> 20:24.285
Good boy.

20:27.525 --> 20:30.485
You were meant to be on work experience
for the whole day.

20:33.725 --> 20:36.045
I realized straight away,

20:36.125 --> 20:38.485
when I came to tell you
that I'd finished my essay,

20:39.245 --> 20:40.885
and the cupboard was open.

20:41.645 --> 20:44.205
Are you sure it was open?
I think I would have noticed.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.245
Miss Cackle.

20:48.285 --> 20:49.485
We have a thief.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.365
I have witnessed activity today,

20:52.805 --> 20:56.325
that may suggest that the wishing star
has already been used.

20:57.605 --> 21:00.485
May I suggest
that you speak to the Hubbles.

21:02.725 --> 21:04.485
I'm surprised you wanted me back.

21:04.925 --> 21:07.725
What with me making
such disgusting cookies and everything.

21:07.805 --> 21:10.205
Oh, those. Those were actually delicious.

21:10.285 --> 21:11.325
Outstanding in fact.

21:11.405 --> 21:13.005
You really are a talented cook.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.205
What am I telling you that for?

21:15.845 --> 21:17.325
You ate one, didn't you?

21:17.405 --> 21:18.285
Yeah.

21:18.365 --> 21:21.165
I was comfort eating
because I felt so ashamed of myself.

21:22.325 --> 21:25.045
You really mustn't take any notice
of the horrible things I said.

21:25.125 --> 21:28.885
I'm just a rather bitter and lonely woman,
and I've been taking it out on you.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.365
Um... Right.

21:32.445 --> 21:34.405
You are really like my daughter, you see.

21:34.485 --> 21:35.605
You have a daughter?

21:36.525 --> 21:38.925
Walking's quite hard
once you've had a taste of flying.

21:39.005 --> 21:40.965
Mum, I was wrong.

21:41.045 --> 21:42.005
Sorry.

21:43.565 --> 21:45.005
Giving you magic, it was...

21:48.245 --> 21:51.405
It was like the time I gave you
chocolate raisins for Christmas.

21:52.525 --> 21:54.725
It wasn't for you, it was for me.

21:55.245 --> 21:58.045
Yeah, but I got to quite like
chocolate raisins in the end.

21:59.725 --> 22:01.045
This is the reversal spell.

22:02.765 --> 22:04.685
So, you just have to say these words.

22:06.885 --> 22:12.245
We have reason to believe
that there is a thief in our midst.

22:12.325 --> 22:16.125
Well, that's a very strong accusation,
Miss Hardbroom.

22:16.205 --> 22:17.645
I hope you've got proof.

22:18.285 --> 22:19.245
Star.

22:22.205 --> 22:24.725
He's had a truth cookie.
He's on the scent of the thief.

22:26.285 --> 22:29.405
Will that suffice?

22:29.485 --> 22:31.725
Maybe he was just being friendly.

22:32.605 --> 22:33.605
Mildred,

22:34.165 --> 22:37.205
what do you know about
the whereabouts of the wishing star?

22:37.285 --> 22:39.045
Wishing star? But we're looking for--

22:39.125 --> 22:41.005
I'm sorry, Miss Cackle.

22:43.765 --> 22:45.125
I think he's picking up another scent.

22:49.005 --> 22:50.325
Where are you all going?

22:50.405 --> 22:51.285
It was her!

22:52.365 --> 22:53.885
I'm sure it was her.

22:55.125 --> 22:58.325
She wouldn't listen to me when she was
getting into trouble at Amulet's.

22:58.885 --> 23:00.725
I'll find you a tissue.

23:00.805 --> 23:03.725
And then one day she pushed it too far
and they expelled her.

23:04.645 --> 23:08.485
I just don't want Mabel throwing away
her education because of me.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.285
Miss Tapioca?

23:14.365 --> 23:16.325
Have you been stealing
from the dining hall?

23:16.405 --> 23:17.245
Oh, yeah.

23:17.325 --> 23:18.845
For weeks now.

23:18.925 --> 23:21.165
I'm sorry, I really am.

23:21.245 --> 23:23.325
I took it all for Mabel, for her studies.

23:23.405 --> 23:25.005
I know it was wrong,

23:25.085 --> 23:26.285
but I was desperate.

23:29.485 --> 23:30.885
Oh, Miss Tapioca.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.725
I must speak to you privately,

23:34.285 --> 23:36.165
about the theft of a wishing star.

23:37.045 --> 23:37.885
What?

23:38.765 --> 23:39.645
Her?

23:39.725 --> 23:41.605
I haven't stolen a wishing star.

23:42.405 --> 23:43.925
She's telling the truth actually.

23:44.005 --> 23:46.365
Miss Cackle will decide that.

23:51.005 --> 23:52.005
No, wait.

23:53.525 --> 23:55.045
She didn't take the wishing star.

23:56.845 --> 23:58.205
-It was--
-It was me.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.965
You stole the wishing star!

24:02.045 --> 24:03.285
I did say that.

24:03.365 --> 24:04.565
Well, not exactly.

24:04.645 --> 24:08.685
Um, I went into the office
to file the attendance reports,

24:08.765 --> 24:09.685
like Miss Hardbroom said,

24:09.765 --> 24:10.965
but I didn't know where they went.

24:11.045 --> 24:14.005
So, I opened a cupboard and
the potion went all over me.

24:14.725 --> 24:15.645
Yeah.

24:15.725 --> 24:18.765
It took three washes to get
that supernatural glow out of my best top.

24:19.765 --> 24:21.525
Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom,

24:21.605 --> 24:23.965
surely you don't believe that?

24:26.245 --> 24:32.085
It is all too believable for a Hubble.

24:33.325 --> 24:36.245
Well, if we're quite done here...

24:36.605 --> 24:37.485
Miss Cackle?

24:37.565 --> 24:40.685
Miss Tapioca has been accused
of some really bad things.

24:40.765 --> 24:42.045
In front of all of us.

24:42.125 --> 24:42.965
Have I?

24:43.485 --> 24:46.005
I mean, she could be due
some compensation.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.725
Unless there was something simple
you could do,

24:48.805 --> 24:49.885
to make it up to her.

24:55.845 --> 24:58.645
Welcome to Cackle's Academy...

24:59.405 --> 25:02.365
Mabel Tapioca.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.605
I don't believe this.

25:13.485 --> 25:15.725
My dad was going to get me
into Pentangle's.

25:16.525 --> 25:18.045
Now I have to come here,

25:18.125 --> 25:19.125
with her.

25:20.725 --> 25:21.605
Embarrassing!

25:28.485 --> 25:33.405
She does not seem to have inherited
your upbeat personality, Miss Tapioca.

25:37.525 --> 25:39.885
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, Miss Tapioca.

25:40.405 --> 25:43.765
Any time you want to help in the kitchen
again, I'd be glad to have you.

25:44.405 --> 25:46.165
You're a good cookery witch.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.125
-Your mother would be proud.
-Thank you.

25:49.365 --> 25:51.405
It was good to have someone to share with.

25:52.205 --> 25:53.925
Always makes things easier.

25:58.005 --> 26:00.125
There's something I should tell you two.

26:01.205 --> 26:02.765
It's about my mum.

26:10.565 --> 26:13.485
And then Miss Hardbroom said she
believed Mum, and somehow...

26:13.965 --> 26:14.805
I got away with it.

26:15.485 --> 26:17.165
Which doesn't make it right.

26:17.725 --> 26:18.605
Yeah, I know.

26:19.805 --> 26:22.005
I've not done much right
since I came back to school.

26:25.485 --> 26:26.605
I'm sorry.

26:27.325 --> 26:28.165
I'll fix things with Mum

26:28.245 --> 26:30.245
and then everything will be
just like it was before.

26:43.405 --> 26:44.885
What are you doing up here?

26:46.085 --> 26:49.005
Oh, it's really quite relaxing
when you get used to it.

26:49.085 --> 26:49.925
Mum.

26:50.445 --> 26:53.525
The way you covered for me
with HB was amazing, but...

26:53.605 --> 26:55.645
we can't get away with it forever.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.725
I was wrong to think we could.

26:58.645 --> 27:00.445
We've got to change you back.

27:00.525 --> 27:03.645
But Mildred, I think you were right
about me.

27:03.725 --> 27:06.165
I think is how I was always meant to be.

27:06.245 --> 27:08.845
I really don't think it's a good idea.

27:09.605 --> 27:10.965
Night, night, Mildred.

27:14.525 --> 27:15.365
Mum?

27:17.245 --> 27:18.365
Mum!
