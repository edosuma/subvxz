No more junk food.

00:03.963 --> 00:07.382
a family that eats healthy.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.911
I have my first

01:14.783 --> 01:16.911
college visit coming up.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.120
I get to stay overnight

01:16.952 --> 01:19.120
in a dorm, tour the campus

01:19.162 --> 01:22.041
and spend 18 hours pretending

01:19.162 --> 01:22.041
my family doesn't exist.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.043
I actually skipped all the way

01:22.082 --> 01:24.043
to school today.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.502
I probably should've stopped

01:25.544 --> 01:27.796
once I passed the football

01:25.544 --> 01:27.796
field, but who cares?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.339
My body may have been stuffed

01:27.838 --> 01:29.339
in a trash can,

01:29.381 --> 01:31.299
but my mind was taking a shower

01:29.381 --> 01:31.299
with a college chick.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.634
REESE: Come on,

01:31.341 --> 01:32.634
there's tons of reasons

01:32.676 --> 01:34.135
to go out with

01:32.676 --> 01:34.135
a guy like me.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.722
To make your dad mad,

01:34.177 --> 01:36.722
or your boyfriend jealous.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.725
Maybe you just hate yourself,

01:36.764 --> 01:39.725
or have a sick curiosity.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.436
I don't know!

01:39.767 --> 01:42.436
I can't do all the work for you!

01:44.187 --> 01:46.147
I thought I at least I had

01:44.187 --> 01:46.147
a chance with the fat ride.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.148
Did you actually

01:46.189 --> 01:47.148
call her that?

01:47.190 --> 01:50.110
Hey, I didn't make her fat.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.614
Who is that?

01:53.655 --> 01:55.449
That's Christie.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.449
She's the new narc.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.617
We have a new narc?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.452
What happened

01:56.658 --> 01:58.452
to Druggie Dougie?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.788
He got served divorce papers

01:58.493 --> 02:00.788
in history class.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.791
Aw, come on, she's so cute.

02:03.832 --> 02:04.875
She's a narc?

02:04.917 --> 02:07.544
Hey, papers?

02:04.917 --> 02:07.544
Anyone got papers?

02:07.586 --> 02:10.547
Hey, papers?

02:07.586 --> 02:10.547
Anybody got papers?

02:10.589 --> 02:12.758
Do you even know anyone

02:10.589 --> 02:12.758
who does drugs?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.802
Why are you asking me?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.802
I don't have any friends.

02:16.011 --> 02:19.431
But sometimes,

02:16.011 --> 02:19.431
I do have brilliant ideas.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.975
Where are you going?

02:21.016 --> 02:24.061
Malcolm, I live in a world

02:21.016 --> 02:24.061
of what the hells.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.983
Ooh...

02:29.024 --> 02:32.402
Oh, man, I am so...

02:33.236 --> 02:35.823
Never mind.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.620
MALCOLM:

02:40.160 --> 02:41.620
You can't do this to me!

02:41.662 --> 02:43.705
Dad's supposed to take me,

02:41.662 --> 02:43.705
not you!

02:43.747 --> 02:46.708
Malcolm, this is your first

02:43.747 --> 02:46.708
visit to a university.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.586
Your father and I talked it

02:46.750 --> 02:49.586
over and we both agreed.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.089
This is a big deal, we

02:49.628 --> 02:52.089
don't want to blow it.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.133
If I come along,

02:52.131 --> 02:54.133
I can make sure

02:54.173 --> 02:55.926
that you don't say or do

02:54.173 --> 02:55.926
anything that you shouldn't.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.719
I can take a little

02:55.968 --> 02:57.719
of the pressure off you.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.680
Wait a second.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.181
You guys are talking about

02:59.721 --> 03:02.181
college for Malcolm and not me?

03:03.266 --> 03:04.267
I'm a year older than he is.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.226
Why aren't you taking me

03:05.268 --> 03:06.895
to look at colleges?

03:08.647 --> 03:10.732
Well, son...

03:10.774 --> 03:14.235
I'm just screwing with you.

03:10.774 --> 03:14.235
Relax.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.988
(sighs of relief)

03:17.489 --> 03:19.033
Dewey, dinner.

03:19.074 --> 03:22.077
I guess he'll eat it cold again.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.163
(piano playing

03:22.119 --> 03:24.163
Offenbach's "The Can-Can")

03:55.318 --> 03:56.945
What the hell

03:56.987 --> 03:58.488
are you doing back here?!

03:58.530 --> 04:00.532
The pianos are for

03:58.530 --> 04:00.532
paying customers only!

04:00.574 --> 04:02.242
You're wearing out the keys!

04:03.827 --> 04:06.287
Hey!

04:06.329 --> 04:08.207
I'm not going

04:06.329 --> 04:08.207
to buy you a piano.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.084
You've never even had lessons.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.210
I don't need lessons.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.586
I already know how to play.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.670
I'm great. Look.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.297
(humming)

04:16.339 --> 04:19.134
That's very cute, Dewey,

04:16.339 --> 04:19.134
but we can't afford a piano.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.137
Do you know how close my company

04:19.176 --> 04:22.137
is to going out of business?

04:22.179 --> 04:24.139
They're selling our

04:22.179 --> 04:24.139
office furniture

04:24.181 --> 04:27.101
and forcing us

04:24.181 --> 04:27.101
to have desk buddies.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.519
Dad, you don't know me

04:27.142 --> 04:29.519
very well,

04:29.561 --> 04:31.230
but you couldn't have missed

04:29.561 --> 04:31.230
the fact

04:31.271 --> 04:32.773
that I'm having

04:31.271 --> 04:32.773
a horrible childhood.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.315
Now there's a chance

04:34.357 --> 04:35.984
for you to make it suck

04:34.357 --> 04:35.984
a little less.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.319
I said no.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.319
End of discussion.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.905
Now you're just going

04:38.361 --> 04:39.905
to have to find

04:39.947 --> 04:41.573
some other way

04:39.947 --> 04:41.573
to amuse yourself.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.544
OTTO:

04:53.001 --> 04:54.544
I don't understand it.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.963
I told all of the guests

04:56.004 --> 04:58.339
about my Hayride for Lovers

04:56.004 --> 04:58.339
on Friday night,

04:58.381 --> 04:59.507
and no one signed up.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.342
Well, most of the guests

04:59.549 --> 05:01.342
have children.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.510
They can't just abandon them

05:02.552 --> 05:04.221
to go on

05:02.552 --> 05:04.221
a couples-only hayride.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.847
We're only allowing couples.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.767
Ah, well, then there--

05:05.889 --> 05:08.767
there is the solution.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.352
We will start

05:08.809 --> 05:11.352
a child-care center.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.563
Ooh, Otto, I don't think...

05:13.605 --> 05:14.773
It will be wonderful.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.441
We will have posture contests,

05:16.483 --> 05:18.777
and I can show them slides

05:18.819 --> 05:20.528
of my childhood

05:18.819 --> 05:20.528
in postwar Germany.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.281
They will love it.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.159
Otto, as great as that idea is,

05:22.322 --> 05:25.159
I wouldn't set my heart on it.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.368
These people came here to spend

05:25.200 --> 05:27.368
time  with  their families.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
They're not just going to dump

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
their children

05:29.412 --> 05:30.455
the first chance they get.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.585
Can we leave them overnight?

05:39.923 --> 05:42.301
...and the delivery's

05:39.923 --> 05:42.301
on time? Good.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.094
I've got a lot of

05:42.341 --> 05:44.094
hungry customers.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.887
Oh, hey, Christie,

05:44.136 --> 05:45.887
I didn't see you.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.555
Are you ready?

05:45.929 --> 05:47.555
I think you're going to be

05:47.597 --> 05:49.891
pleasantly surprised

05:47.597 --> 05:49.891
by how much ice cream I can eat.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.393
Look, Reese, um,

05:49.933 --> 05:52.393
you know, we got coffee,

05:52.435 --> 05:55.022
and we saw a movie,

05:52.435 --> 05:55.022
and we went skating.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.608
I thought hanging out with you

05:55.063 --> 05:58.608
would involve a little more...

05:58.650 --> 05:59.901
partying.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.987
Don't you have like

05:59.943 --> 06:01.987
a friend

06:02.029 --> 06:04.031
or maybe

06:02.029 --> 06:04.031
someone you know of

06:04.072 --> 06:08.202
or someone you heard rumors

06:04.072 --> 06:08.202
about that could help us out?

06:08.243 --> 06:10.787
Hey, I got to trust somebody

06:08.243 --> 06:10.787
before I party with them.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.413
You trust me, don't you?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.665
Not yet, but there must be

06:13.707 --> 06:15.250
some way a hot girl like you

06:15.292 --> 06:17.418
can get a desperate guy

06:15.292 --> 06:17.418
like me to trust you.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.254
Hey, why don't we go

06:17.460 --> 06:19.254
park by the river

06:19.296 --> 06:21.380
and see if we can

06:19.296 --> 06:21.380
think of something.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.426
LOIS:

06:23.175 --> 06:25.426
I hope you weren't hunched over

06:23.175 --> 06:25.426
like that during your interview.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.512
Why didn't you tell him about

06:25.468 --> 06:27.512
your extracurricular activities?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.306
How do you even know

06:27.554 --> 06:29.306
what I said?

06:29.348 --> 06:31.058
Did you have your ear pressed up

06:29.348 --> 06:31.058
against the door?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.851
You should be a little less

06:31.099 --> 06:32.851
concerned about what I did

06:32.893 --> 06:34.728
and a little bit more concerned

06:32.893 --> 06:34.728
about your own performance.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.147
And next time say "bless you"

06:34.769 --> 06:37.147
when he sneezes.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.691
These people are looking for

06:37.189 --> 06:39.691
any excuse not to like you.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.318
All right, 230.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.737
You walked me to my dorm room,

06:41.360 --> 06:43.737
you chose my lunch,

06:43.778 --> 06:46.489
you tucked in my shirt in

06:43.778 --> 06:46.489
the middle of orientation.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.449
Now will you

06:46.531 --> 06:48.449
please just leave?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.160
Why are you in such a hurry

06:48.491 --> 06:50.160
to get rid of me?

06:50.202 --> 06:52.453
Because I'm supposed to be doing

06:50.202 --> 06:52.453
this stuff on my own.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.956
I'm just here to make sure you

06:52.495 --> 06:54.956
do it on your own the right way.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.669
Hi. Are you Malcolm?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.669
Yeah.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.671
I'm Paula. And this

06:59.711 --> 07:01.671
is Andrea and Scott.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.174
I guess we're all going

07:01.713 --> 07:04.174
to be roommates tonight.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.466
Cool. Well,

07:04.216 --> 07:05.466
I'll put my bags, uh...

07:05.508 --> 07:08.095
Excuse me. You mean

07:05.508 --> 07:08.095
you boys and you girls

07:08.136 --> 07:09.721
are staying

07:08.136 --> 07:09.721
in the same room?

07:09.763 --> 07:13.183
Yeah. It'll be just like

07:09.763 --> 07:13.183
really being in college.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.271
There. Now we'll all have

07:17.312 --> 07:19.314
the same version

07:17.312 --> 07:19.314
of what happened here.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.945
That's exactly

07:23.026 --> 07:24.945
what I would have done, Lois.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.529
Yep. Camped out in the room.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.574
You didn't happen to take

07:26.571 --> 07:29.574
the oven timer, did you?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.201
I can't understand this...

07:31.243 --> 07:33.287
All week stuff has been

07:31.243 --> 07:33.287
disappearing

07:33.328 --> 07:34.704
right from under my nose.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.999
It's like I put something down,

07:34.746 --> 07:37.999
and then it's just gone.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.419
No, it's not even anything

07:38.041 --> 07:40.419
worth stealing.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.713
It's as if someone is trying

07:40.460 --> 07:43.713
to make me crazy on purpose.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.548
You're probably right.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.634
I love you, too. Bye.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.347
What the...?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.692
Can I please have

08:02.607 --> 08:04.692
some more lemonade?

08:04.734 --> 08:07.570
What a wonderfully polite

08:04.734 --> 08:07.570
little boy.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.530
Please, take a sewing kit

08:09.572 --> 08:11.532
und  a small moisturizer.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.535
Otto, none of the parents

08:11.574 --> 08:14.535
showed up for the hayride.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.578
Their kids are here.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.704
It's so weird.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.457
Nobody's answering their phones,

08:18.498 --> 08:19.540
so I went by all their rooms.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.418
They all have

08:19.582 --> 08:21.418
Do Not Disturb...

08:21.460 --> 08:22.543
Oh.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.587
I guess I better go get

08:22.585 --> 08:24.587
a pep talk ready

08:24.629 --> 08:27.424
for housekeeping

08:24.629 --> 08:27.424
in the morning.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.509
(music playing,

08:27.466 --> 08:29.509
talking low, indistinctly)

08:32.053 --> 08:34.348
Mom, what are you doing

08:32.053 --> 08:34.348
with my underwear?!

08:34.389 --> 08:36.557
You had it all crammed

08:34.389 --> 08:36.557
up there in the corner.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.269
Wrinkled clothes

08:36.599 --> 08:39.269
are the sign of a

08:36.599 --> 08:39.269
disorganized mind.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.645
So then I took a guided tour

08:40.687 --> 08:42.272
of the Plaza de Espana

08:40.687 --> 08:42.272
in Barthelona.

08:42.314 --> 08:43.273
I'm not mispronouncing it.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.566
That's the way they say it.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.566
Barthelona.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.943
That is so interesting.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.653
I wish I was

08:46.985 --> 08:48.653
more interesting.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.571
Do you think it would be

08:48.695 --> 08:50.571
pretentious to use

08:50.613 --> 08:52.573
the word "legerdemain" into a

08:50.613 --> 08:52.573
conversation with the dean?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.159
What am I saying?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.577
Of course it's pretentious.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.577
I'm such a lackwit.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.497
Relax. If you can't be

08:56.619 --> 08:58.497
pretentious in college,

08:58.538 --> 08:59.580
where can you be pretentious?

08:59.622 --> 09:01.041
Really? So when

08:59.622 --> 09:01.041
I get to college

09:01.082 --> 09:02.501
it'd be okay if I

09:01.082 --> 09:02.501
called myself Antigone?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.085
Of course.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.504
(knocking)

09:08.507 --> 09:10.591
All right, kid, here's the deal,

09:08.507 --> 09:10.591
my name is Leland.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.593
More importantly,

09:10.633 --> 09:12.593
I'm the RA,

09:12.635 --> 09:14.595
which stands for

09:12.635 --> 09:14.595
Resident Advisor,

09:14.637 --> 09:16.639
which means I'm in charge

09:14.637 --> 09:16.639
of this floor.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.100
So you're going to have

09:16.681 --> 09:19.100
to keep the music down.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.101
Is it really that loud?

09:20.143 --> 09:21.686
Listen, guy,

09:21.728 --> 09:24.772
I can either be your best friend

09:21.728 --> 09:24.772
or your worst nightmare.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.067
Now turn the radio down.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.068
Is there a problem here?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.487
Who are you?

09:30.529 --> 09:32.613
I'm his mother.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.613
I'm supervising these kids

09:32.655 --> 09:33.614
in this coed room

09:33.656 --> 09:35.825
which I cannot believe

09:33.656 --> 09:35.825
your school condones.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.827
You know, ma'am,

09:35.867 --> 09:37.827
that's not what I'm here about.

09:37.869 --> 09:41.622
That radio is at least five dBs

09:37.869 --> 09:41.622
above the approved noise level.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.208
I'd hate to have

09:41.664 --> 09:43.208
to confiscate it

09:43.250 --> 09:46.294
or move on to more

09:43.250 --> 09:46.294
serious consequences.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.629
You know what, Leland?

09:48.671 --> 09:49.630
I've been to college.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.132
I know exactly

09:49.672 --> 09:51.132
how much power

09:51.174 --> 09:53.634
and authority an RA has.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.635
Good night.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.556
Wow.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.099
Malcolm, your mom

09:57.597 --> 09:59.099
is awesome.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.600
I am so glad

09:59.140 --> 10:00.600
you brought her.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.278
This horn's from Dad's van,

10:11.319 --> 10:12.820
and this one's

10:11.319 --> 10:12.820
from Mom's car

10:12.862 --> 10:16.324
and this one's

10:12.862 --> 10:16.324
from the ice cream truck.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.665
Dewey. What are you doing?

10:24.707 --> 10:25.875
The spout fell down.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.544
I'm fixing it.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.170
Good boy.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.381
Listen, I talked

10:29.212 --> 10:31.381
with Mrs. Hittelman down

10:29.212 --> 10:31.381
the block and she said

10:31.423 --> 10:33.674
that if you want,

10:31.423 --> 10:33.674
you can use  her  piano.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.470
Thanks anyway, Dad, but I found

10:33.716 --> 10:36.470
something else to amuse myself.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.678
Oh. Well, good.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.889
Hey, have you

10:37.720 --> 10:39.889
seen my hair dryer?

10:39.931 --> 10:42.976
I swear, it's like stuff is just

10:39.931 --> 10:42.976
getting up and walking off.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.685
Either that

10:43.017 --> 10:44.685
or someone's

10:44.727 --> 10:48.315
messing with me.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.650
Dad, I think I figured out

10:48.356 --> 10:50.650
what's going on.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.487
Somebody's sneaking

10:51.610 --> 10:53.487
into the house

10:53.528 --> 10:54.695
and stealing stuff.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.697
Probably punks.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.325
No, not punks, son.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.329
Just good kids

10:58.366 --> 11:02.329
who got lost along the way.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.705
Either way, they're going down.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.171
LOIS:

11:08.543 --> 11:11.171
And then the priest said,

11:08.543 --> 11:11.171
"Those aren't my galoshes."

11:11.212 --> 11:12.713
(girls laughing)

11:12.755 --> 11:14.715
Mom is actually

11:12.755 --> 11:14.715
letting me walk all the way

11:14.757 --> 11:16.176
to the vending machine and back

11:16.217 --> 11:18.052
without tying

11:16.217 --> 11:18.052
a string to my waist.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.309
Ha.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.436
This moment is almost as sweet

11:26.478 --> 11:27.937
as the candy you can't have.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.399
Wow. Denied candy.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.984
If I were 12

11:31.441 --> 11:32.984
years younger,

11:33.026 --> 11:34.777
I guess I'd cry.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.904
LOIS:

11:34.819 --> 11:36.904
What's going on out here?

11:36.946 --> 11:38.156
Oh, God, no.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.741
The snack bar is closed.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.327
You're denying

11:40.783 --> 11:42.327
my son candy?.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.537
Mom, it doesn't matter.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.038
I'll just go down

11:43.578 --> 11:45.038
to the next floor.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.041
Use of the vending machine

11:45.079 --> 11:48.041
is a privilege, not a right.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.792
If my son wants

11:48.082 --> 11:49.792
a candy bar,

11:49.834 --> 11:50.793
he can have a candy bar.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.587
You don't get to decide for him.

11:53.171 --> 11:53.963
I get to decide.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.756
Do I even need

11:54.005 --> 11:55.756
to be here for this?

11:55.798 --> 11:57.384
Since I'm the one

11:55.798 --> 11:57.384
with the key to the lock,

11:57.425 --> 11:59.260
I think  I'm  in charge.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.432
Come on.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.600
This isn't over yet.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.685
Mom, why don't you

12:06.725 --> 12:07.810
just put me

12:06.725 --> 12:07.810
in a diaper?

12:07.852 --> 12:09.354
One thing at

12:07.852 --> 12:09.354
a time, Malcolm.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.606
First, we're going to

12:09.396 --> 12:11.606
get you that candy.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.401
CHRISTIE:

12:13.024 --> 12:14.401
...and my parents

12:14.442 --> 12:16.695
they just drive me crazy.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.780
I just need to ditch reality

12:16.735 --> 12:19.780
and escape sometimes.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.283
You know what I mean?

12:26.829 --> 12:29.583
Look, Christie,

12:26.829 --> 12:29.583
here's the thing.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.085
When I first met you,

12:29.624 --> 12:32.085
I was just messing around,

12:32.126 --> 12:34.462
but we've gotten

12:32.126 --> 12:34.462
so close that now...

12:34.504 --> 12:35.796
I really like you.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.050
I can't keep this up anymore.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.176
What do you mean?

12:40.218 --> 12:41.802
I'm not the person

12:40.218 --> 12:41.802
you think I am.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.222
I've been pretending

12:41.844 --> 12:44.222
since the day I met you.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.474
It's so hard having

12:44.264 --> 12:46.474
to constantly cover my tracks

12:46.516 --> 12:48.602
to keep my story straight,

12:48.643 --> 12:50.228
and I don't want to anymore.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.812
I'm tired of living this lie.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.691
Reese, I think I

12:51.854 --> 12:54.691
know your secret.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.026
No, actually, you don't,

12:54.733 --> 12:57.026
but it doesn't matter

12:57.068 --> 12:58.653
'cause I'm done with it.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.905
I'm sorry.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.827
(sighs)

13:04.783 --> 13:06.827
Did you get all that?

13:06.869 --> 13:09.456
Yeah, it looks like

13:06.869 --> 13:09.456
he's going straight.

13:09.497 --> 13:13.501
So if we're going to bust

13:09.497 --> 13:13.501
this kid, we better do it now.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.754
All Malcolm wanted

13:13.543 --> 13:15.754
was a candy bar,

13:15.794 --> 13:18.632
but Leland put a lock

13:15.794 --> 13:18.632
on the vending machine.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.300
We can't let him get

13:18.673 --> 13:20.300
away with this.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.552
I want to go on record:

13:20.341 --> 13:22.552
I hated him first.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.346
This would never

13:22.594 --> 13:25.346
happen in Barthelona.

13:25.388 --> 13:26.847
Why are Americans

13:25.388 --> 13:26.847
so immature?

13:26.889 --> 13:28.516
Why don't you just write

13:26.889 --> 13:28.516
an angry note

13:28.558 --> 13:31.645
or-or a missive

13:28.558 --> 13:31.645
after I get accepted?

13:31.686 --> 13:33.647
Look, Scott, you'll face

13:31.686 --> 13:33.647
jerks and tyrants

13:33.688 --> 13:35.106
like Leland all your life.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.858
The sooner you learn how

13:35.148 --> 13:37.858
to deal with them, the better.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.277
And no one's chances

13:37.900 --> 13:39.277
of getting into this school

13:39.319 --> 13:41.362
are going to be affected.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.531
He is going to

13:41.404 --> 13:43.531
hand over that key.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.117
How?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.117
I don't know yet,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.535
but there are plenty of ways

13:47.577 --> 13:48.869
to force people

13:47.577 --> 13:48.869
to do what you want.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.872
You can find something

13:48.911 --> 13:51.872
incriminating in their room.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.249
You can get dirt

13:51.914 --> 13:53.249
from a bitter ex,

13:53.291 --> 13:55.042
or you can make

13:53.291 --> 13:55.042
a blanket accusation

13:55.084 --> 13:56.711
with absolute

13:55.084 --> 13:56.711
conviction

13:56.753 --> 13:58.879
and just wait for them

13:56.753 --> 13:58.879
to blurt out something.

13:58.921 --> 13:59.964
Wait.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.258
You use that trick

14:00.006 --> 14:02.258
on me all the time.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.969
No, sweetie, that's

14:02.300 --> 14:04.969
a different thing entirely.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.763
We've gotta get

14:05.011 --> 14:06.763
Malcolm some candy.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.556
(excited chattering)

14:08.598 --> 14:12.101
Well, I guess I'll be cool

14:08.598 --> 14:12.101
and popular  after  college.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.774
HAL:

14:16.147 --> 14:17.774
Dewey?

14:21.027 --> 14:21.902
Dad! In here!

14:21.944 --> 14:23.112
Quick!

14:21.944 --> 14:23.112
What is it?.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.532
I just saw someone

14:23.154 --> 14:25.532
sneak out with Mom's robe.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.534
Good eye, son.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.910
HAL:

14:28.409 --> 14:29.910
Halt!

14:29.952 --> 14:33.414
Halt, you damn punks!

14:33.456 --> 14:35.124
(children screaming happily)

14:35.166 --> 14:36.751
(doorknob rattles)

14:37.627 --> 14:38.919
OTTO:

14:37.627 --> 14:38.919
Everything is fine.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.296
Nothing in here

14:40.338 --> 14:42.298
but children enjoying

14:40.338 --> 14:42.298
themselves dancing

14:42.340 --> 14:43.924
and skipping like

14:42.340 --> 14:43.924
young lambs.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.925
Come again soon.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.010
Otto, it's Francis.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.554
I have the DVDs. Let me in.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.097
(children screaming happily)

14:50.139 --> 14:53.184
We have a

14:50.139 --> 14:53.184
slight problem.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.811
You know how I

14:53.226 --> 14:54.811
wanted everything

14:54.853 --> 14:56.771
to be special

14:54.853 --> 14:56.771
for the children.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.774
So I went to the store

14:56.813 --> 14:59.774
and I got those cookies

14:59.816 --> 15:03.611
and then I saw this

14:59.816 --> 15:03.611
old-fashioned hard lemonade,

15:03.653 --> 15:05.029
I bought three cases.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.947
Hard lemonade?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.947
That has alcohol in it.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.451
Yes, Francis, I  said

15:06.989 --> 15:10.451
there was a problem.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.663
(children shouting happily)

15:13.705 --> 15:15.874
Who lives in a pineapple

15:13.705 --> 15:15.874
under the sea?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.584
I do. I do.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.879
Don't tell me to

15:17.625 --> 15:20.879
use  my  indoor voice.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.923
Why don't you use

15:20.920 --> 15:23.923
your  indoor voice?.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.967
I'm not just

15:24.924 --> 15:26.967
saying it, man.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.970
We should totally

15:27.009 --> 15:29.970
have a play date.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.891
Oh, my God.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.602
These parents trusted me

15:32.932 --> 15:35.602
with their little ones

15:35.643 --> 15:37.228
und  I've poisoned them.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.022
What kind of a monster am I?

15:40.064 --> 15:41.148
Otto, you made an

15:40.064 --> 15:41.148
honest mistake,

15:41.190 --> 15:42.859
but everything's

15:41.190 --> 15:42.859
gonna be okay.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.985
As long as the kids are

15:42.901 --> 15:44.985
in here, they're safe.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.321
Oh!

15:53.035 --> 15:54.161
Well,

15:54.203 --> 15:56.205
it's a little early for

15:54.203 --> 15:56.205
Christmas carols, isn't it?

15:56.247 --> 15:59.083
Leland, I think we got off

15:56.247 --> 15:59.083
on the wrong foot earlier.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.628
Obviously, this job

15:59.125 --> 16:01.628
is very important to you.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.004
Who knows where you

16:01.669 --> 16:04.004
could find another

16:04.046 --> 16:05.924
that commands respect and power.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.383
You know, it would

16:05.965 --> 16:07.383
be such a shame

16:07.425 --> 16:09.594
if somehow you got fired

16:07.425 --> 16:09.594
and had to go back home

16:09.636 --> 16:11.011
where your older

16:09.636 --> 16:11.011
brother and sister

16:11.053 --> 16:13.055
get all the attention

16:11.053 --> 16:13.055
that  you  deserve.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.601
Do you really want to risk that

16:13.097 --> 16:16.601
for a 75-cent candy bar?

16:16.643 --> 16:19.854
You really have me pegged--

16:19.896 --> 16:21.898
Except for what you're

16:19.896 --> 16:21.898
forgetting is--

16:21.940 --> 16:24.024
the lower the stakes,

16:21.940 --> 16:24.024
the greater the thrill

16:24.066 --> 16:25.902
from the arbitrary

16:24.066 --> 16:25.902
exercise of power.

16:25.944 --> 16:29.196
If this were a one-cent candy

16:25.944 --> 16:29.196
bar, I'd be on the moon.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.532
I happen to be

16:29.238 --> 16:31.532
a control freak.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.909
If you get me fired,

16:31.574 --> 16:32.909
I'll just

16:32.951 --> 16:34.619
find some other job

16:32.951 --> 16:34.619
where I can be a control freak.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.120
Kinko's is looking

16:34.661 --> 16:36.120
for a night manager.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.539
Either way,

16:36.162 --> 16:38.539
I've already written

16:38.581 --> 16:40.082
negative-evaluation

16:38.581 --> 16:40.082
e-mails of these kids

16:40.124 --> 16:42.042
to the Office

16:40.124 --> 16:42.042
of Admissions.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.003
All I have to do

16:42.084 --> 16:44.003
is hit "Send."

16:45.087 --> 16:47.882
She overloaded

16:45.087 --> 16:47.882
a wall socket, too!

16:49.091 --> 16:52.011
We're just like

16:49.091 --> 16:52.011
the bulls in Pamplona.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.055
Now, you.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.350
Any freshman Psych major

16:55.097 --> 16:57.350
can see it's obvious

16:57.391 --> 16:59.853
life didn't pan out the way

16:57.391 --> 16:59.853
you thought it would,

16:59.894 --> 17:02.981
so now to make up for it,

16:59.894 --> 17:02.981
you have to run your kid's life.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.065
I don't know who

17:03.773 --> 17:05.065
to root for.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.150
The simple truth is,

17:06.192 --> 17:08.068
you're just

17:06.192 --> 17:08.068
too afraid to let go

17:08.110 --> 17:10.530
of the one thing in your life

17:08.110 --> 17:10.530
that  may  be a success.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.073
But, hey, you don't have

17:10.571 --> 17:13.073
to take my word for it.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.117
Why don't we just ask

17:13.115 --> 17:15.117
the other mothers here

17:15.159 --> 17:16.911
and see what  they  think?

17:17.912 --> 17:18.913
Oh, that's right.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.957
There  are  no other mothers here.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.085
You just cost this floor

17:22.208 --> 17:25.085
their electricity privileges.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.764
Mom?

17:36.806 --> 17:38.683
I can't do this.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.893
What?

17:39.934 --> 17:41.185
I wanted to help you,

17:39.934 --> 17:41.185
to take care

17:41.227 --> 17:43.062
of things for you,

17:41.227 --> 17:43.062
but you know what?

17:43.771 --> 17:46.106
I'm just not up to it.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
I think you should

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
do this on your own.

17:48.150 --> 17:48.985
What?

17:49.027 --> 17:50.403
It's time for me

17:49.027 --> 17:50.403
to step aside

17:50.444 --> 17:52.739
and let you handle things.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.200
Malcolm, I know

17:53.614 --> 17:56.200
you can do this.

17:57.952 --> 18:01.288
Unless I missed the sarcasm,

17:57.952 --> 18:01.288
I think she meant that.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.834
I've actually been given

18:01.330 --> 18:04.834
permission to run my own life.

18:04.876 --> 18:08.128
Well, at least

18:04.876 --> 18:08.128
get my own candy bar.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.839
But you know what?

18:09.881 --> 18:13.760
I want that candy bar more

18:09.881 --> 18:13.760
than I want my next breath.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.428
I have a plan.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.096
(yelling)

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
Malcolm, what

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
are you doing?

18:21.183 --> 18:22.226
My plan.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.186
Well, get your foot

18:22.268 --> 18:24.186
out of the door.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.480
It's stuck.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.152
By the way, our Madrigal group

18:29.067 --> 18:32.152
is having a sing-off

18:32.194 --> 18:33.404
against Jazzmatazz tomorrow.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.074
You should check it out

18:33.446 --> 18:36.074
before you leave.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.242
(grunts)

18:39.493 --> 18:40.870
All right, Jamie,

18:40.912 --> 18:44.040
this'll put a stop

18:40.912 --> 18:44.040
to all the stealing.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.375
And your father is

18:44.082 --> 18:46.375
a reasonable man,

18:46.417 --> 18:49.629
but sometimes

18:46.417 --> 18:49.629
even he can be pushed too far.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.505
You don't poke the bear.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.763
Police! Nobody move!

18:58.805 --> 19:00.014
We have a warrant

19:00.056 --> 19:01.181
to search these premises

19:01.223 --> 19:03.810
on suspicion of

19:01.223 --> 19:03.810
possession of narcotics.

19:04.727 --> 19:05.979
Nice.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.188
Narcotics?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.188
What are you... (shrieks)

19:09.231 --> 19:10.190
Sir, we need you

19:09.231 --> 19:10.190
to just remain calm,

19:10.232 --> 19:12.276
and we'll get through this

19:10.232 --> 19:12.276
as quickly as possible.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.404
Weren't you Annie Oakley

19:13.527 --> 19:15.404
in the school play?

19:15.446 --> 19:18.741
Yeah, but I wasn't very good.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.418
(Offenbach's

19:27.041 --> 19:29.418
"The Can-Can" plays)

19:38.469 --> 19:40.721
My stuff!

19:40.763 --> 19:43.057
♪ ♪

19:58.364 --> 20:00.741
(song ends)

20:00.783 --> 20:02.242
Oh, my God.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.912
All this time, you were just

20:02.284 --> 20:04.912
using me to get to my dad?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.498
And all this time

20:06.080 --> 20:07.498
you were selling drugs,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.375
and you never even

20:07.540 --> 20:09.375
bought us a DVD player?

20:10.751 --> 20:13.171
Get him out of here.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.050
(burps)

20:17.091 --> 20:19.259
Hey, doctor man,

20:19.301 --> 20:22.513
it must be great

20:19.301 --> 20:22.513
saving people all day.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.349
What do I do?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.309
Play kickball.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.269
They're going to have

20:29.311 --> 20:30.646
some spectacular headaches,

20:30.688 --> 20:32.732
but, uh,

20:30.688 --> 20:32.732
otherwise they'll be fine.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.983
That is good news.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.860
Thank you

20:34.025 --> 20:35.860
for coming out here, Doctor.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.154
I don't say anything about this,

20:35.902 --> 20:38.154
you don't say anything

20:38.196 --> 20:41.281
about the keys

20:38.196 --> 20:41.281
I left in your gallbladder.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.159
Deal.

20:43.201 --> 20:46.079
So what are we going to do

20:43.201 --> 20:46.079
about the parents?

20:46.120 --> 20:47.287
(laughing)

20:47.329 --> 20:49.289
Come on, honey, it's time

20:47.329 --> 20:49.289
to go back to the room

20:49.331 --> 20:52.292
with your wonderful,

20:49.331 --> 20:52.292
wonderful father.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.003
Thank you so much.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.004
You saved our marriage.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.339
I almost forgot

20:55.046 --> 20:57.339
she was a woman.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.008
Let's go, son.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.342
Whoa, Dad.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.302
You want to turn

21:00.384 --> 21:02.302
the volume down?

21:03.846 --> 21:05.723
It's not a total loss.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.349
When they took the door

21:05.765 --> 21:07.349
off the hinges,

21:07.391 --> 21:09.102
they discovered

21:07.391 --> 21:09.102
Leland had a hot plate.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.353
We all got to watch

21:09.143 --> 21:11.353
while they made him unplug it

21:11.395 --> 21:12.605
and put it in the closet.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.190
Don't you worry

21:12.646 --> 21:14.190
about it, honey.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.025
Just be glad

21:14.232 --> 21:16.025
this was our safety school.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.693
When we go to Yale,

21:16.067 --> 21:17.693
I promise I'll be

21:17.735 --> 21:19.570
much more on top of things.
