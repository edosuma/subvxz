<i>Your group released property</i>

00:14.904 --> 00:17.104
<i>without my written consent.
As a result, you're parked.</i>

00:17.140 --> 00:19.373
Your sound is the exact thing
we've been looking for.

00:19.409 --> 00:20.975
- And that's my music.
- I lied to you.

00:21.010 --> 00:22.543
We can go all the
way with this, man.

00:22.579 --> 00:24.445
- We?
- Yeah, we. We share the publishing.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.756
Please welcome to the
stage Angel and Andy!

00:27.761 --> 00:29.094
How did Jahil get
his nephew in front

00:29.118 --> 00:30.618
<i>- of Ayanna like that?
- I don't know,</i>

00:30.653 --> 00:32.408
<i>- but I'm about to find out.
- Who's this?</i>

00:32.412 --> 00:35.100
- My boy Lucky. Yo, Lucky, this is Star.
- This is the girl you be talking about?

00:35.124 --> 00:37.191
<i>- This is just sex.
- Let me see your I.D.</i>

00:37.227 --> 00:38.704
- Don't pull a brother over for nothing.
- Noah, stop.

00:38.728 --> 00:40.048
- Officer, listen...
- Noah, stop!

00:41.831 --> 00:43.598
<i>Court is in session.</i>

00:43.633 --> 00:45.132
<i>You may be seated.</i>

00:46.133 --> 00:47.773
You're requesting a
review of this matter,

00:47.804 --> 00:50.671
but there's still the issue of
your prison record, Ms. Brown.

00:50.740 --> 00:53.441
Your Honor, I've completed
parenting classes.

00:53.476 --> 00:54.842
Simone is keeping her grades up.

00:54.877 --> 00:57.144
And breaking curfew
and getting drunk

00:57.180 --> 00:58.691
- with her former roommate.
- She's only doing that

00:58.715 --> 01:01.582
because she is unhappy
in that facility.

01:01.618 --> 01:04.452
She's acting out because she's
used to being in a home.

01:04.486 --> 01:06.921
<i>- My</i> home.
- I'm sorry,

01:06.956 --> 01:09.090
but nothing has changed
since the last hearing.

01:09.125 --> 01:12.693
The request to restore
foster care status...

01:14.191 --> 01:15.975
is denied.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.999
Simone Davis will
remain in the custody

01:18.034 --> 01:20.635
of the Morrison Juvenile
Detention Center.

01:21.638 --> 01:23.804
I'm sorry, baby.

01:25.178 --> 01:28.175
- Simone...
- We got her, we got her, we got her.

01:29.579 --> 01:31.212
- Simone?
- Simone, listen.

01:31.247 --> 01:33.281
Simone, come on. Please.

01:34.065 --> 01:36.615
I know this didn't go
how we expected, okay?

01:36.620 --> 01:39.037
But you got to understand
that this is not forever.

01:39.042 --> 01:41.145
You'll be out of here
as soon as you turn 18.

01:41.150 --> 01:42.816
Or as soon as we
win that showcase.

01:42.852 --> 01:46.520
I'm-I'm serious.

01:46.555 --> 01:48.022
Simone, do not hurt yourself.

01:48.057 --> 01:50.057
If you do that, you're
giving them the power.

01:51.594 --> 01:53.460
Simone, please stop doing that!

01:55.031 --> 01:56.997
I'm gonna play... I'm
gonna play a song.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.299
Okay. Simone, listen.

01:59.335 --> 02:01.502
This is the song we
just did, the new one.

02:01.537 --> 02:03.704
I want you to listen
to it and focus on it.

02:03.739 --> 02:06.940
Okay? This is what's gonna
get you out of there.

02:06.976 --> 02:08.609

03:30.426 --> 03:32.326
You really scared me that time.

03:33.496 --> 03:35.763
Winning the showcase
is my only way out,

03:35.798 --> 03:38.599
and Ayanna's not even
paying attention to us.

03:38.634 --> 03:40.601
We got GiGi Nixon
into Midtown, okay?

03:40.636 --> 03:44.138
We did that. Don't think
she doesn't recognize.

03:44.173 --> 03:46.740
There's got to be some way
for her to notice us.

03:46.776 --> 03:49.610
- I'll set her office on fire.
- What?

03:49.645 --> 03:51.123
You burned my sister,
I burn your stuff.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.247
You can't say that
stuff in a courtroom.

03:53.282 --> 03:54.960
But just a small one. I'll do,
like, a trash can or a couch

03:54.984 --> 03:56.795
- or something like that.
- Don't be stupid. No fires!

03:56.819 --> 03:58.218
Fine!

03:58.254 --> 03:59.920
It smells really bad in here.

03:59.955 --> 04:01.989
- Was it you?
- Was it you?

04:03.225 --> 04:04.424
Come out!

Horrible.

04:32.321 --> 04:35.189
I guess I've been taking
parenting classes for no reason.

04:35.224 --> 04:37.558
Judge ain't willing
to see no change.

04:37.593 --> 04:39.560
I heard about Jahil's boys.

04:39.595 --> 04:42.262
How they just gonna skate
through to the showcase?

04:42.298 --> 04:43.530
I was gonna tell you.

04:43.566 --> 04:45.132
Well, what about my girls?

04:45.167 --> 04:47.968
I need to have some words
with Ayanna today.

04:48.003 --> 04:51.405
Mm, Ayanna's not exactly focused
on Take Three right now.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.040
Not with all the press
from the shooting.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.875
And she hasn't
seen Noah in days.

04:54.910 --> 04:56.610
Well, maybe because
his best friend

04:56.645 --> 04:58.478
just got shot for no reason.

04:58.514 --> 04:59.714
And he posted Ayanna's picture

04:59.748 --> 05:01.348
with the hashtag
♪MidtownMatters.

05:01.383 --> 05:02.649
It's bad press.

05:02.685 --> 05:05.819
Better if you stay
off her radar today.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.960
You need to shut this down.

05:12.995 --> 05:15.829
Noah's hashtag infers
that black lives

05:15.865 --> 05:17.364
don't matter to Midtown.

05:17.399 --> 05:20.200
We make R&B music... Of
course black lives matter.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.636
I marched with King.

05:22.671 --> 05:24.538
I stumped for Obama.

05:24.573 --> 05:27.040
You're just gonna sit
on this damn story?

05:27.076 --> 05:30.544
As head of Midtown, you've got
to make a formal announcement.

05:30.579 --> 05:33.447
You know how hard it
is to build a company.

05:33.482 --> 05:36.683
Everything that happens to
<i>your</i> label happens to <i> my</i> name.

05:36.719 --> 05:39.753
Speak up, girl. You better
speak up and do it damn quick!

05:45.476 --> 05:47.094
Hey, nephew, we did it.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.729
We got a contract at Midtown,

05:48.764 --> 05:51.231
and we got a spot
in the showcase.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.033
Hit me up. Sho'!

05:53.068 --> 05:55.569
So you weaseled your boys a
spot in the showcase, huh?

05:55.604 --> 05:58.305
I'll bet you feel
good about yourself.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.607
Oh, yeah, I feel real good.

06:00.643 --> 06:03.343
You know what a judge
said to Simone today?

06:03.847 --> 06:06.546
She looked her in the face and told
her she had to go back to juvie.

06:06.582 --> 06:09.816
Damn. I mean, that kid
can't catch a break.

06:09.852 --> 06:12.239
This showcase <i> is</i> her break.

06:12.742 --> 06:14.988
Well, that's on you, then,
to put her in it, right?

06:15.024 --> 06:16.490
I am.

06:17.261 --> 06:18.792
It's hard to compete
with pillow talk.

06:18.827 --> 06:20.394
Oh, here we go. You know what?

06:20.429 --> 06:23.063
Look, I put together
a strong act, okay?

06:23.098 --> 06:24.665
I gave Ayanna what she wanted.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.166
I bet you did.

06:27.102 --> 06:29.169
You know what, Lottie?
Don't even go there.

06:29.204 --> 06:30.437
I promise you,

06:30.472 --> 06:33.407
I ain't never goin'<i> there</i> again.

06:39.935 --> 06:41.815
A little faster would
be really nice.

06:42.715 --> 06:44.679
Can you chill a little bit?
Thieving takes time.

06:44.684 --> 06:46.506
We need to find
something Ayanna wants.

06:46.511 --> 06:48.644
- Why you think I ain't got no record?
- You do.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.914
Not for thievin'.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.519
Oh, hell, yeah.

06:56.554 --> 06:58.921
Check it. It's Ayanna's
artist wish list.

06:58.956 --> 07:00.234
Everybody that she
wants at Midtown

07:00.258 --> 07:01.590
is on this list right here.

07:01.626 --> 07:04.260
Joyce Sheree... top of the list.
Makes sense.

07:04.295 --> 07:06.629
She can do R&B and hip-hop,

07:06.664 --> 07:08.297
and she got a fat ass.

07:09.402 --> 07:10.966
She do. And it's tight.

07:11.002 --> 07:13.102
- Googling now.
- Yo, what if we got

07:13.137 --> 07:15.704
Joyce Sheree to sing a verse on the song?
We could give her

07:15.740 --> 07:17.618
to Ayanna, and that would give
us leverage in the showcase.

07:17.642 --> 07:19.119
Okay, look, come here,
come here, come here.

07:19.143 --> 07:21.811
It says here that Joyce
Sheree is performing

07:21.846 --> 07:23.979
at the Stand Up to
Cancer event tonight.

07:24.015 --> 07:25.455
We got to get in
there and meet her.

07:25.483 --> 07:27.450
I can't... I got curfew.
Did y'all forget?

07:27.485 --> 07:28.851
Shh...

07:32.607 --> 07:33.756
What's up?

07:35.207 --> 07:36.692
Noah, I'm...

07:36.727 --> 07:38.494
really sorry about your friend.

07:39.294 --> 07:40.429
Thanks.

07:48.706 --> 07:51.640
- Yo, he must be real messed up.
- Yeah, for sure.

07:51.676 --> 07:54.109
I hope he can get his head
in the game after all that.

07:54.145 --> 07:55.478
You pulling for him?

07:55.513 --> 07:57.012
Nah. I'm just saying,

07:57.048 --> 07:58.926
I want strong competition
so we can get in there

07:58.950 --> 08:01.723
- and knock 'em out.
- This benefit is steep.

08:01.934 --> 08:04.453
They're asking five grand
just to get into the door.

08:04.489 --> 08:06.155
- Damn.
- I mean, can't you front?

08:06.190 --> 08:07.656
You got them deep-ass pockets.

08:07.692 --> 08:10.259
They're not bottomless, Simone.

08:10.294 --> 08:11.594
Now, GiGi and Joyce are tight,

08:11.629 --> 08:13.762
and she was all over
us at the A&R event.

08:14.665 --> 08:16.031
She'll hook us up.

08:16.901 --> 08:18.067
That's a good idea.

08:18.102 --> 08:20.402
You go be BFFs with
GiGi and Joyce,

08:20.438 --> 08:22.171
and I'm-a go shake a money tree.

08:22.206 --> 08:23.672
- Great.
- Yo, Star, you know

08:23.708 --> 08:25.975
we can't bail your
crazy ass out of jail.

08:26.010 --> 08:28.644
You might.

08:28.679 --> 08:30.646
- Thanks for letting me come over.
- Of course.

08:30.681 --> 08:32.914
I've been trying to get
over to the store, but...

08:32.950 --> 08:34.549
You know. Everything
good, though?

08:34.585 --> 08:36.150
Nah, I'm pissed.

08:36.187 --> 08:38.187
I'm still not over that
Lucky Keyes shooting.

08:38.222 --> 08:40.456
Your girlfriend's
at Midtown, right?

08:40.491 --> 08:42.591
I'm wondering if we
can get her on film

08:42.626 --> 08:44.894
to talk about that ♪
MidtownMatters hashtag.

08:47.505 --> 08:48.531
Probably not.

08:48.566 --> 08:50.633
Just because she got to,
like, keep the label happy.

08:50.668 --> 08:53.969
You know? I hate that it's
like that, but it is.

08:54.005 --> 08:56.505
- What is it you're working on?
- It's a documentary.

08:56.541 --> 08:57.740
I'm looking at the connection

08:57.775 --> 08:59.542
between microaggression
and violence.

08:59.577 --> 09:02.511
Wow. A girl about action.
That's dope.

09:02.547 --> 09:04.680
I guess we can't expect
change in people.

09:04.715 --> 09:07.516
- Unless we... educate 'em.
- Unless we teach 'em.

09:07.876 --> 09:09.418
Right.

09:15.081 --> 09:17.484
You need to stop
showing up in my room.

09:17.489 --> 09:19.373
I could do anything I want.

09:19.378 --> 09:21.564
The Hunter Morgan Foundation
pays for this room

09:21.632 --> 09:23.732
and your expenses.

09:23.768 --> 09:26.902
Here's the equipment to
help us get into her phone.

09:26.938 --> 09:28.404
Hmm.

09:28.439 --> 09:30.739
I want to know Star
won't get hurt by this.

09:30.775 --> 09:32.474
Now you're the good daddy?

09:32.510 --> 09:34.043
Please.

09:36.311 --> 09:38.480
She won't get hurt.

09:38.516 --> 09:39.882
But you will.

09:39.917 --> 09:42.117
The money you owe those
people in Vegas,

09:42.153 --> 09:44.920
they're really sheisty people.

09:44.956 --> 09:47.656
And they can be here the
second I make the call.

09:52.897 --> 09:54.630
She wants to meet me for coffee.

09:55.900 --> 09:59.368
Just get the pictures
off her damn phone.

09:59.403 --> 10:02.938
I'm gonna go broke if you don't.

10:11.415 --> 10:14.516
I can't tell you how sorry
I am about your friend.

10:16.454 --> 10:18.921
Course you can't. I didn't
hear you tell anybody.

10:18.956 --> 10:21.590
Nothing I say will
change what happened.

10:21.626 --> 10:22.970
A black kid with a
record gets shot,

10:22.994 --> 10:24.271
and everybody thinks
he had it coming.

10:24.295 --> 10:27.145
And you won't put Midtown
in the middle of it.

10:27.802 --> 10:29.498
You put Midtown in
the middle of it

10:29.533 --> 10:31.500
when you created a hashtag.

10:31.535 --> 10:34.036
- I need you to recant.
- You're crazy.

10:34.071 --> 10:36.472
All you care about is
this damn showcase.

10:36.507 --> 10:39.408
We are about to have all
eyes on us in Atlanta,

10:39.443 --> 10:43.044
and here you are actively
working against Midtown.

10:43.049 --> 10:45.202
You were supposed to be good PR,

10:45.299 --> 10:47.516
but instead you're the opposite.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.720
I need an artist

10:51.756 --> 10:54.623
or a group who can
go the distance,

10:54.659 --> 10:57.393
someone who isn't going to
be a detriment to my label,

10:57.428 --> 10:59.561
someone who is going to be worth

10:59.597 --> 11:02.698
a tour and an album.

11:05.202 --> 11:07.503
Right now that's not
looking like it's you.

11:20.885 --> 11:22.718
What the hell was that?

11:22.753 --> 11:25.554
None of your business.

11:25.623 --> 11:27.937
Okay, I'm here to
talk about my girls.

11:29.190 --> 11:31.694
We both know they've been
killing it over and over,

11:31.729 --> 11:34.596
and you put Jahil's boys
in after just one gig?

11:34.632 --> 11:36.347
I don't have time for this.

11:36.352 --> 11:37.933
Well, what do you have time for?

11:37.968 --> 11:39.868
It sure ain't taking
care of my girls

11:39.904 --> 11:41.170
or Noah, for that matter.

11:41.205 --> 11:42.735
Excuse me?

11:42.740 --> 11:45.100
You walking around here like
you scared to make a mistake,

11:45.105 --> 11:47.138
ignoring everyone waiting
for you to say something

11:47.143 --> 11:49.845
about this black boy's death.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.714
I am a professional.

11:51.749 --> 11:54.183
This is a business.

11:54.218 --> 11:57.419
- It is about music and money.
- Wake up.

11:57.455 --> 12:01.256
Handle your business so we
could get back to business.

12:01.292 --> 12:03.258
You don't know what
you're talking about.

12:03.294 --> 12:06.061
Well, at least I'm
talking about something.

12:57.452 --> 12:58.951
Was I expecting you?

13:01.508 --> 13:04.605
No, you were not, but I wanted
to give you this in person.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.611
- Oh.
- Big ups for coming to Midtown.

13:07.646 --> 13:09.264
Can't believe we're
label sisters now.

13:09.269 --> 13:11.548
Why you playing yourself?
You ain't no slouch.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.353
Damn, you know your bubbles.

13:17.347 --> 13:18.889
Thank you. So, - You're welcome.

13:18.957 --> 13:20.690
I grew up in the music
industry, right?

13:20.726 --> 13:22.259
Uh-huh.

13:22.294 --> 13:24.795
And I've experienced firsthand
how women do better when

13:24.830 --> 13:26.674
- they help each other up.
- Oh, girl, ain't nothing worse than

13:26.698 --> 13:29.218
a bitch trying to steal your
music or your man. You can have

13:29.223 --> 13:31.423
my hand-me-down dudes, but
never mess with my music.

13:31.459 --> 13:32.825
Ever.

13:32.860 --> 13:35.294
- Amen to that.
- Mm.

13:35.329 --> 13:38.038
I have a... a question for you.

13:38.043 --> 13:39.064
Yeah.

13:39.396 --> 13:41.950
More of a solid than
a question, but...

13:41.985 --> 13:43.618
You and Joyce Sheree...
You're tight?

13:43.654 --> 13:45.887
Joyce is my baby. Got a
lot of love for J-Sexy.

13:45.923 --> 13:47.589
Well, in that case, me and my...

13:47.624 --> 13:49.457
Okay, you know what?
Let me finish this

13:49.493 --> 13:50.992
'fore these clowns
go into overtime.

13:51.028 --> 13:52.668
But come back later.
We're having a party.

13:52.696 --> 13:54.396
- You down to talk then?
- Bet.

13:54.431 --> 13:55.897
Okay. I'm hot.

13:55.933 --> 13:59.200
- See ya.
- I need a fan! It's hot as hell!

13:59.236 --> 14:00.969
The showcase needs to
be the biggest story

14:01.004 --> 14:02.704
coming out of Midtown, not this.

14:02.739 --> 14:05.307
You'll have a full PR damage
control report by end of day.

14:05.342 --> 14:07.709
Oh. Uh, Ms. Floyd, do
you have a minute?

14:07.744 --> 14:10.145
- Not a sec.
- I wasn't sure if you heard,

14:10.180 --> 14:12.547
but we may have Joyce Sheree
singing on one of our tracks.

14:12.582 --> 14:14.015
"May have" is not a thing.

14:14.051 --> 14:15.450
If you want to be
in the showcase,

14:15.485 --> 14:16.818
don't rely on hypotheticals.

14:16.853 --> 14:18.520
Be the best, and you'll get in.

14:20.791 --> 14:24.559
If it ain't gonna happen, let
us know or let us the hell out.

14:27.831 --> 14:29.197
You know, I've ruined everything

14:29.232 --> 14:31.333

thrown into juvie.

14:31.368 --> 14:34.069
Everybody 'round me,
looking at me side-eyed,

14:34.104 --> 14:36.237
scared that I'm gonna
screw it all up again.

14:37.238 --> 14:39.474
And the worst part about it is,

14:39.509 --> 14:42.010
is that they're probably right.

14:43.213 --> 14:46.715
Do you even know what
that feels like?

14:47.884 --> 14:50.352
Actually, I do.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.235
- No comment.
- What about Noah Brooks' post?

18:49.259 --> 18:50.703
Does Midtown matter
more than black lives?

18:50.727 --> 18:52.126
- Hey.
- I said no comment.

18:52.162 --> 18:53.573
- Step back, man.
- Get him out of here.

18:53.597 --> 18:55.029

- Wow.

18:55.065 --> 18:56.431

Alex and Noah did a

daughter and Noah Brooks?

19:06.818 --> 19:08.605
You know how many
clicks that would get?

19:08.640 --> 19:10.740
It could help with
your PR situation.

19:10.776 --> 19:13.677
Get people to stop talking
about Noah trashing Midtown.

there's gonna be a movie at GiGi's.
We should go.

21:00.285 --> 21:02.652
We can just forget about
this whole Midtown crap,

21:02.687 --> 21:04.988

you're still upset about Lucky.

Come on, Star, I'm not...
I'm not that high.

- Star, come on.
- You got to go.

21:17.269 --> 21:20.837

Okay.

I can't believe Roland Crane's
daughter needs a hookup from me.

- Hmm.

23:22.027 --> 23:23.738

I can't believe

23:23.762 --> 23:26.697

honey, that's not ratchet.

My daughter here found
this on the floor.

25:15.792 --> 25:16.981

was rented.

I know exactly who you are,
you don't have to tell me.

25:57.202 --> 25:59.002
You're the biggest thing
in Atlanta right now.

25:59.037 --> 26:01.481

- Girl, stop.

26:01.486 --> 26:03.373
You're being humble, but
you know it's true.

26:03.408 --> 26:05.175
I'm an artist, too.
Over at Midtown Sound.

26:05.210 --> 26:06.810
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

26:06.845 --> 26:09.913
Midtown is in a lot of
hot water right now.

26:09.948 --> 26:12.149

They're asses.

26:12.184 --> 26:13.650

- You know what that is? Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:16.755 --> 26:18.755
We're working on our album now.

26:18.790 --> 26:21.625

ass, getting me

26:21.660 --> 26:24.261
the community center
to shoot in and...

26:24.296 --> 26:26.463
all those people for
the documentary.

26:26.498 --> 26:28.832
- Thank you.
- Nah. I really think

26:28.867 --> 26:30.545
you should be adding your
name to that list, though.

26:30.569 --> 26:32.435
Especially what happened
to us, you know?

26:32.471 --> 26:35.105
As long as I wear a
hijab, I'm different.

26:35.140 --> 26:37.240
And I like it. You know?

26:37.276 --> 26:39.609
It puts me in solidarity
with all my Muslim sisters.

26:39.645 --> 26:41.656
Even though white folk are
always trying to help me.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.847
They think the hijab's a
symbol of oppression.

26:43.882 --> 26:45.482

26:45.517 --> 26:47.362

me how to do my culture?"

I mean, her... I get it. You?

30:17.462 --> 30:19.396
You say that all the time.

30:21.199 --> 30:22.932
I found something, Miss C.

30:22.968 --> 30:24.768
Emancipation.

30:24.803 --> 30:27.170
Ayanna called her lawyer
and said it was an option.

30:27.205 --> 30:29.873
- Ayanna?
- Yeah, she said she would help me out.

30:29.908 --> 30:31.872
I just got to prove that I
can take care of my money,

30:31.877 --> 30:33.209
and then we go to
the courthouse,

30:33.245 --> 30:34.711
and then you testify and boom...

30:34.746 --> 30:36.112
Out of juvie.

30:36.148 --> 30:38.047
I know all about emancipation.

30:38.083 --> 30:40.150
I looked into it. I
tried everything.

30:40.185 --> 30:41.429
Yeah, well, we
haven't tried this.

30:41.453 --> 30:42.786
All you got to do is testify.

30:42.821 --> 30:44.921
Not with my record.
Me testifying

30:44.956 --> 30:46.665
is gonna work against you.

30:46.894 --> 30:49.058
I got a record too, Simone.

30:49.094 --> 30:50.727
They don't want to
hear from me, either.

30:54.833 --> 30:57.267
You know what, it's like you
want me to stay in there.

30:57.302 --> 30:59.536
That's the last thing I want.
I promise you.

30:59.571 --> 31:02.439
You can't keep giving me
any more promises, Miss C.

31:05.444 --> 31:07.177
Y'all give me a minute.

31:21.858 --> 31:24.093
Yeah, you need to stay the
hell out my business.

31:24.129 --> 31:25.695
Don't tell me this
is about Jahil.

31:25.730 --> 31:27.664
Jahil? I don't give a...

31:29.367 --> 31:30.900
Stay away from Simone.

31:30.936 --> 31:33.102
Stop filling her head
with false promises.

31:33.138 --> 31:35.071
You don't know a damn
thing about that girl.

31:35.106 --> 31:37.307
And I'm sure you
know everything.

31:37.342 --> 31:39.108
You really gonna try me on this?

31:39.144 --> 31:41.077
I've been there for that
girl since day one.

31:41.112 --> 31:43.746
Emancipation is not
the answer for her.

31:43.782 --> 31:45.348
She's young, she's
impressionable...

31:45.383 --> 31:47.317
She needs adult supervision.

31:47.352 --> 31:50.220
It's really not your
decision anymore, is it?

31:50.255 --> 31:52.689
Okay, maybe everything
you care about

31:52.724 --> 31:54.991
is under Midtown's roof,
and that's your world,

31:55.026 --> 31:57.060
but those girls are my world.

31:57.095 --> 31:59.106
- They're my artists.
- They're a meal ticket for you,

31:59.130 --> 32:00.897
just like everybody
else over there.

32:00.932 --> 32:02.310
If they don't sing, you don't eat.
They're nothing

32:02.334 --> 32:04.200
but numbers on a
spreadsheet to you.

32:04.236 --> 32:06.870
And if you actually did care,
maybe you wouldn't be sitting

32:06.905 --> 32:08.805
over there with your mouth
closed while all hell

32:08.840 --> 32:11.875
is breaking loose. Those
girls are my babies.

32:11.910 --> 32:14.043
So if it ain't about business,

32:14.079 --> 32:15.445
stay the hell away from them,

32:15.480 --> 32:16.724
or I'm-a come at
you with something

32:16.748 --> 32:18.681
you can't even imagine.

32:18.717 --> 32:21.584
And as for Jahil...
Been there, done that.

32:23.438 --> 32:24.598
Bitch.

32:27.759 --> 32:29.058
Last thing I need people knowing

32:29.094 --> 32:31.027
is that I'm sleeping
with a manager.

32:32.831 --> 32:34.230
Sorry, baby.

32:42.847 --> 32:44.747
The housekeeper
will show you out.

32:46.015 --> 32:47.247
Damn, girl. Come on.

32:47.252 --> 32:48.682
The showcase is in a month.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.817
I have to create some buzz.

32:50.853 --> 32:53.487
Well, why don't we,
uh, go for round two

32:53.522 --> 32:56.490
and forget about the damn
showcase for just a minute?

32:56.525 --> 33:00.193
I can't get to the damn
showcase in a minute.

33:00.229 --> 33:03.063
Okay, all eyes are
going to be on me.

33:03.098 --> 33:05.966
The entire Atlanta
music industry,

33:06.001 --> 33:07.501
my family.

33:07.536 --> 33:10.671
They expect me to mess
up because I always do.

33:10.706 --> 33:12.706
Yeah, but you don't roll
that way at Midtown.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.275
Because I can't
afford one slipup.

33:15.311 --> 33:17.778
I begged my father
to give me Midtown.

33:19.268 --> 33:20.892
This might be just a piece
of property for him,

33:20.916 --> 33:22.382
but if I can turn this around,

33:22.418 --> 33:24.751
starting with this showcase,

33:24.787 --> 33:28.455
and make it one of the
Floyd flagship labels...

33:28.490 --> 33:30.023
He'll see you.

33:31.034 --> 33:34.161
Right now all he sees
is this PR mess.

33:34.196 --> 33:36.129
I handled it all wrong.

33:36.816 --> 33:38.598
So why don't you fix it?

33:38.634 --> 33:41.034
If I issue a statement, it'll
just prove he was right.

33:41.070 --> 33:42.903
He's always right.

33:43.950 --> 33:47.874
Carlotta may think I don't care,
but I probably care too much.

33:49.011 --> 33:52.579
So what are you
gonna do about it?

33:53.637 --> 33:55.649
What are you going
to do about it?

33:55.684 --> 33:58.618
♪ ♪

34:07.706 --> 34:09.563
You was out late last night,

34:09.598 --> 34:10.964
bouncing early today.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.733
You get any sleep?

34:13.422 --> 34:15.101
Um, a little.

34:21.172 --> 34:23.130
Something happened yesterday.

34:26.833 --> 34:29.016
Um, yeah, about that...

34:29.051 --> 34:32.485
Me and Soraya were working

34:32.521 --> 34:34.755
and...

34:36.277 --> 34:37.646
And what?

34:40.337 --> 34:41.731
I got wood.

34:43.106 --> 34:44.106
With her?

34:44.786 --> 34:46.065
But we haven't...

34:46.101 --> 34:50.170
I know. That's what I'm saying.

34:51.358 --> 34:53.072
I mean...

34:54.326 --> 34:56.109
- Do you like her?
- No.

34:57.610 --> 34:59.254
I-I do not.

34:59.439 --> 35:01.354
It ain't got nothing
to do with her.

35:02.025 --> 35:03.950
That's what I'm saying.
It just happened.

35:08.466 --> 35:11.425
You always tell me the truth.

35:13.462 --> 35:16.496
I love that about you.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.065
I'll never lie to you.

35:23.072 --> 35:24.671
Baby.

35:26.627 --> 35:28.241
Baby, don't cry.

35:28.277 --> 35:30.544
I'm sorry.

35:31.565 --> 35:33.046
Hey.

35:34.719 --> 35:36.817
How 'bout you sing?

35:37.676 --> 35:39.514
The one that you swear
is corny, though.

35:40.856 --> 35:42.055
What?

35:42.091 --> 35:44.224
No, I can't sing right now.

35:44.259 --> 35:45.758
Yes, you can.

35:46.764 --> 35:48.140
For me.

35:49.173 --> 35:50.408
Please?

35:51.626 --> 35:53.166
Then I got a surprise for you.

35:53.914 --> 35:55.702
It's a big one.

36:04.486 --> 36:06.646
Yeah.

36:25.033 --> 36:26.666

39:19.140 --> 39:20.907
I'm sorry.

39:24.769 --> 39:27.047
I have to tell you
something, too.

39:30.153 --> 39:32.085
It's about Noah Brooks.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.195
I called.

39:43.268 --> 39:44.628
I called twice.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.540
Could've called three times,
I wasn't gonna answer.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.441
You look rough.

39:55.724 --> 39:57.597
I-I feel like it.

39:58.727 --> 40:01.201
I went ham last night.

40:01.351 --> 40:05.452
Look, I wanted to talk to you
about the-the pictures online.

40:07.864 --> 40:10.357
- What pictures?
- Come on, you want to do this?

40:10.392 --> 40:12.559
Or you want to be real, Star?
Um,

40:12.594 --> 40:15.697
I know you saw the hookup
with me and your girl.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.624
I just wanted-wanted to
say we were frontin',

40:18.629 --> 40:20.100
just to get some play.

40:20.135 --> 40:23.168
I should've came to you and
talked to you about it first...

40:24.400 --> 40:25.839
I'm sorry.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.510
You don't got to talk
to me about nothing.

40:30.545 --> 40:32.771
You don't have to
run nothing by me.

40:33.582 --> 40:35.126
- You don't owe me nothing, man.
- Come on, Star.

40:35.150 --> 40:38.084
You don't owe me nothing.
Just...

40:38.120 --> 40:39.652
do what you want to do.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.187
For real.

40:41.223 --> 40:43.356
Star, don't be like that.

40:44.926 --> 40:46.526
Star...

40:57.172 --> 40:59.639
I didn't say anything before,

40:59.674 --> 41:01.941
but I should have.

41:01.977 --> 41:03.276
I owe you,

41:03.311 --> 41:05.278
my family name,

41:05.313 --> 41:09.382
and the young black man who
was shot more than that.

41:09.418 --> 41:12.085
<i>I didn't want to see what
was right in front of me.</i>

41:12.120 --> 41:15.650
Front door, deadbolt, back door.

41:18.107 --> 41:19.767
You got me out of juvie?

41:19.772 --> 41:22.762
For today, yes. Tomorrow,
I'll start calling lawyers

41:22.798 --> 41:24.497
for more permanent options.

41:24.533 --> 41:26.399
There's an address.

41:26.435 --> 41:29.850
<i>I didn't want to admit I
was part of the problem.</i>

41:30.906 --> 41:35.175
<i>I held back, because I
didn't want to be wrong.</i>

41:35.210 --> 41:37.410
You know, I hate to say it,
but I don't think Midtown

41:37.446 --> 41:39.579
is the best place for y'all.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.124
What are you doing?

41:47.389 --> 41:48.914
Was you just talkin'?

41:49.090 --> 41:50.390
- Never mind.
- I'm sorry.

41:51.499 --> 41:52.625
I need to check on Simone.

41:52.661 --> 41:54.194
That's what I need to be doing.

41:54.229 --> 41:56.696
D... Oh, damn it. Can
I use your phone?

41:56.731 --> 41:59.532
- Where's yours?
- I dropped it at the party last night.

41:59.568 --> 42:00.767
I'm freaking out.

42:01.670 --> 42:04.137
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

42:04.172 --> 42:06.239
Hope you have good pics on here.

42:06.274 --> 42:09.112
You better stay
out of my photos.

42:09.844 --> 42:11.678
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

42:12.250 --> 42:16.282
<i>I was trying to protect
the wrong thing.</i>

42:19.387 --> 42:21.788
<i>And when injustice happens,</i>

42:21.823 --> 42:25.225
<i>it's on all of us to speak up.</i>

42:31.491 --> 42:33.770
<i>Because being silent</i>

42:33.775 --> 42:35.568
<i>is its own kind of evil.</i>

42:38.621 --> 42:40.483
Are you gonna scream?

42:46.848 --> 42:48.414
Just got out today.

42:48.450 --> 42:50.016
What do you want?

42:51.443 --> 42:53.553
I wanted you to answer my calls.

43:01.308 --> 43:02.929
I told you we were done.

43:02.964 --> 43:06.399
You ain't ever gonna be
able to leave me, girl.

43:07.905 --> 43:11.471
<i>And the devil is in the silence.</i>
