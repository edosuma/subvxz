00:07.050 --> 00:15.232
â™ª

00:15.276 --> 00:16.581
[reporter] We are live at the

00:16.625 --> 00:18.496
Fall Oaks Annual
Christmas Festival

00:18.540 --> 00:20.281
where Fall Oaks native
Rachel Kennedy

00:20.324 --> 00:23.240
has returned to not
only kick off the festivities

00:23.284 --> 00:25.721
but will also be presenting
her live event,

00:25.764 --> 00:28.202
Rachel Kennedy's Inspiration
Celebration

00:28.245 --> 00:30.204
which coincides with
the upcoming release

00:30.247 --> 00:32.119
of her newest
motivational book,

00:32.162 --> 00:34.773
"Me First" her follow
up to last year's book,

00:34.817 --> 00:36.558
"You Deserve It All".

00:36.601 --> 00:38.560
With the best-selling
author in town

00:38.603 --> 00:43.173
this is sure to be an exciting
and inspiring holiday for all.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.623
Wow.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.756
They're sure excited to have
you back home.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.758
Wish the feeling was mutual.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.063
Thank you, Bridget.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.196
You sure being back home
isn't getting to you?

01:07.937 --> 01:09.852
The publishers really wanna
push the successful

01:09.895 --> 01:12.681
home-grown heroine returns
to her roots story.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.074
I really need you
to sell this.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.945
I know. And I will.

01:15.988 --> 01:18.687
Alright, it's almost that time.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.646
We'll see you on stage
doing what you do best.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.171
I know.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.825
[exhales]

01:26.869 --> 01:28.218
Inspire.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.699
[crowd cheering]

01:30.742 --> 01:32.004
Now that we've
officially opened

01:32.048 --> 01:33.571
the Fall Oaks Christmas
countdown,

01:33.615 --> 01:40.404
it's sure to be our best
Christmas season so far!

01:40.448 --> 01:43.494
And now, please join in
welcoming our hometown hero,

01:43.538 --> 01:45.017
Rachel Kennedy!

01:45.061 --> 01:47.237
[cheering]

01:47.281 --> 01:50.893
Thank you, Mayor Hartley,
for this special honour.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.068
[applause]

01:52.112 --> 01:54.026
And I am so looking forward
to seeing

01:54.070 --> 01:57.291
each and every one of you
at my live

01:57.334 --> 02:00.032
"The Inspiration Celebration"
event.

02:00.076 --> 02:03.035
[cheering]

02:03.079 --> 02:07.475
I would like to take a moment
to speak from the heart.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.433
I have some homework
for you.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.087
When you go home tonight

02:11.131 --> 02:13.959
I would like you to take
a look in the mirror.

02:14.003 --> 02:17.615
Really look at the person
looking back at you.

02:17.659 --> 02:21.315
That is the most important
person in your universe

02:21.358 --> 02:24.274
and you need to take care
of that person first.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.884
Thank you.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.669
[applause]

02:27.712 --> 02:30.759
And now, the people of
Fall Oaks and I

02:30.802 --> 02:33.153
would like to present to you
the key to the city!

02:33.196 --> 02:36.460
[cheering]

02:41.987 --> 02:43.467
Well, that was a good day.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.512
I think it was a really
good day.

02:44.555 --> 02:45.556
Mmmhmm.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.862
This is you right here.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.211
Great.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.691
So...

02:49.734 --> 02:53.477
Bridget apparently has
a romantic Skype date with Josh

02:53.521 --> 02:55.914
so wanna grab a bite to eat?

02:55.958 --> 02:57.220
No can do.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.439
I gotta go over the expenditures

02:58.482 --> 03:00.919
and check in with
the family back home.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.834
I hope the hotel
has good wifi.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.010
Ok.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.186
Hey.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.231
Tonight is your chance
to unwind.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.146
We got you in this great
townhouse.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.148
Put your feet up, watch
an old Christmas movie.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.410
Order some take-out.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.194
They do have take-out
in this town, right?

03:14.237 --> 03:15.238
No, you're right.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.675
We have a long two weeks
ahead of us.

03:17.719 --> 03:18.807
I... I should.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.243
Well, I'm uh, I'm over here.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.288
You have a good night.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.245
Thank you.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.986
Get some rest.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.640
Good night.

03:40.176 --> 03:41.699
[sighs]

04:16.952 --> 04:18.519
Who found time to decorate?

04:18.562 --> 04:20.738
The Mayor had it set up
for us when we arrived.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.305
Alright, let's focus.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.133
We need to knock this event
out of the park.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.526
And we will.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.005
We agree with the publishers
to market "Me First"

04:27.049 --> 04:30.270
as much as we can and increase
your public visibility.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.401
Remember your second book.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.577
It didn't sell well, I know.

04:33.621 --> 04:34.709
Now, about this event.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.406
Who do are we flying in
to produce it?

04:36.450 --> 04:37.799
Bridget?

04:37.842 --> 04:39.757
Here are the local producers.
There's not many-

04:39.801 --> 04:40.584
Wait, wait, wait.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.411
Locals?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.543
Yeah.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.022
The publishers want us
to hire locally,

04:44.066 --> 04:47.025
generate some opportunity
in the area.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.680
Get you some human interest
press coverage.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.247
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.553
I'll set the appointments.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.424
Also, I know it's not
your favourite subject

04:54.468 --> 04:56.948
but we should talk about this
year's Christmas gift list.

04:56.992 --> 04:57.688
Right.

04:57.732 --> 04:58.820
Christmas gifts.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.474
For my brother David
and his family.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.345
Let's get them really
high-end stuff.

05:02.389 --> 05:05.783
A watch for Suzy, the latest
sneakers for the kids...

05:05.827 --> 05:07.045
That's what you got them
last year.

05:07.089 --> 05:10.092
And for David?

05:10.135 --> 05:12.355
Um... I don't know.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.314
I don't even know
what he likes anymore.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.185
When was the last time
I saw him?

05:16.228 --> 05:17.795
When mom died?

05:20.276 --> 05:21.712
You know what?

05:21.756 --> 05:22.800
I'll take care of it.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.413
Just find me a reliable
producer.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.153
I'm on it.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.070
Your family and friends
sure are lucky.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.550
I'm sorry?

05:33.594 --> 05:36.379
Oh, it's just that these gifts
are really, really nice.

05:36.423 --> 05:41.428
Yeah, well, if you can't
give time, give gifts, right?

05:41.471 --> 05:44.431
Um, so do you want all of these
wrapped and delivered to you?

05:44.474 --> 05:45.823
Yeah, that would be great.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.259
Thank you.

05:47.303 --> 05:50.088
We're really excited to have
you back in Fall Oaks.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.656
Your books have truly
inspired me.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.918
Yeah?

05:53.962 --> 05:55.572
Your first book, by the way,
is my favourite.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.226
"Spark the fire within."

05:57.269 --> 05:58.619
Ever since I read it
I've been dying to go to

05:58.662 --> 06:00.185
one of your big seminars.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.796
That's great.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.363
You should come to the one we're
having in a couple of weeks.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.540
Oh, I'd love to but
it's so expensive.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.846
Who knew inspiration
costs so much, huh?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.763
Excuse me?

06:15.287 --> 06:16.941
Hey.

06:16.985 --> 06:20.380
Um... Santa or snowman?

06:20.423 --> 06:21.381
I'm sorry?

06:21.424 --> 06:22.643
Which one's better?

06:22.686 --> 06:25.036
The uh, the big guy
or the other big guy?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.473
It's for a festive Christmas
sweater party,

06:26.516 --> 06:27.778
I thought I'd wear a tie.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.477
You know, buck the system.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.218
I'm thinking the snowman
kinda brings out my eyes

06:33.262 --> 06:34.959
a little bit more, right?

06:35.003 --> 06:37.048
But green golfing Santa
with the scuba reindeers

06:37.092 --> 06:40.704
really snubs its nose
at convention, doesn't it?

06:43.272 --> 06:46.884
I guess I would go with
the Snowman...

06:46.928 --> 06:47.798
Snowman, right?

06:47.842 --> 06:48.451
Yeah.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.234
Right?

06:49.278 --> 06:50.105
Yeah.

06:50.148 --> 06:50.975
Ok, snowman it is, I think.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.237
Thanks.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.456
Sure.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.457
I'm Jack.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.067
Rachel.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.940
Oh yeah.

06:58.983 --> 06:59.723
Yeah.

06:59.767 --> 07:00.507
Nice to meet you.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.464
Hi.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.987
Um, welcome home, right?

07:03.031 --> 07:03.727
Yeah.

07:03.771 --> 07:04.902
[phone vibrating]

07:04.946 --> 07:05.860
Are you from Fall Oaks?

07:05.903 --> 07:07.470
No, no, no. I'm-
I'm from Boston.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.603
Snowman tie it is.

07:09.646 --> 07:10.430
Uh, I have to get this.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.822
It's a work thing.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.563
Merry Christmas.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.525
Merry Christmas.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.745
Jack.

07:23.704 --> 07:27.447
[phone ringing]

07:27.490 --> 07:28.273
Hey.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.492
Rachel, hey.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.102
I think I found
the perfect producer

07:31.146 --> 07:32.495
and the publishers are on board.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.322
Good.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.410
Wait, where are you?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.890
No, I'm just leaving
the store now.

07:35.933 --> 07:36.978
Please tell me you didn't
buy David socks.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.458
Ok, goodbye.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.504
[honking]

07:41.548 --> 07:42.766
[thud]

07:43.158 --> 07:44.551
Ohhh.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.644
Oh, goodness.

07:50.687 --> 07:53.124
Are you ok?

07:53.168 --> 07:54.952
I'm ok.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.606
Are you ok?

07:56.650 --> 07:58.869
Yeah, I think I am.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.958
You just saved my life.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.874
Well, I just did what anyone
would do.

08:03.918 --> 08:04.832
No, I'm serious.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.834
You just saved my life.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.879
Is there anything I can do
to thank you?

08:08.923 --> 08:10.141
You just did.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.534
You don't owe me anything.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.535
No, please.

08:12.579 --> 08:13.797
Is there anything I can do?

08:13.841 --> 08:15.320
Seriously?

08:17.584 --> 08:20.630
You can help someone else
who needs help.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.378
Wha- what's your name?

08:29.421 --> 08:30.945
Joy.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.556
My name's Joy.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.097
[knocking]

08:53.141 --> 08:54.577
Why didn't you return
any of my calls last night?

08:54.621 --> 08:55.970
What happened?

08:56.013 --> 08:57.667
Oh, Bridget, can you grab me
an ice pack please?

08:57.711 --> 08:59.016
Of course.

08:59.060 --> 08:59.800
Thank you.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.366
Ice pack?

09:01.410 --> 09:03.194
I almost got hit by a car,
Stuart.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.283
What?

09:05.327 --> 09:06.241
Are you- what?

09:06.284 --> 09:07.547
Wait. Why didn't you call me?

09:07.590 --> 09:08.983
I'm fine.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.245
But I wouldn't have been
if someone hadn't pushed me

09:10.288 --> 09:12.334
out of the way in the nick
of time.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.770
Who was it?

09:13.814 --> 09:16.860
Her name was, uh... Joy.

09:16.904 --> 09:17.557
Joy?

09:17.600 --> 09:18.732
Yeah.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.472
She have a last name?

09:20.516 --> 09:23.258
We didn't get that far.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.087
Christmas Joy Saves
Rachel Kennedy.

09:26.130 --> 09:26.870
I can see it.

09:26.914 --> 09:27.784
We can use this.

09:27.828 --> 09:28.785
Are you serious?

09:28.829 --> 09:29.873
Of course I am.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.006
This is real life, Stuart.

09:32.049 --> 09:35.009
Some random person
came out of nowhere,

09:35.052 --> 09:36.663
swooped in, and saved me.

09:36.706 --> 09:40.623
And, you know, I just can't stop
thinking about the whole thing.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.320
I just feel like saying
the words "thank you"

09:42.364 --> 09:43.713
isn't enough.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.323
I'm sure your "thank you"
was plenty.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.760
Wanna know what
she said to me

09:46.803 --> 09:48.457
when I asked what I could
do to thank her?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.719
What?

09:49.763 --> 09:53.244
She said "help someone else
who needs help".

09:54.463 --> 09:56.204
Does she know who you are?

09:56.247 --> 09:57.422
That's not my point.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.511
You are helping people
every single day.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.601
Every book release,
every seminar you give.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.560
Am I? Am I really?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.822
I mean, would I have done
the same?

10:05.866 --> 10:07.519
So you wanna run around town
saving people

10:07.563 --> 10:08.825
from oncoming traffic?

10:08.869 --> 10:10.653
Thank you.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.351
Look, I understand
that you're feeling

10:13.395 --> 10:15.092
a little emotional
right now,

10:15.136 --> 10:17.007
but we have our biggest
live event

10:17.051 --> 10:19.706
in less than two weeks
and I have our new producer

10:19.749 --> 10:22.056
waiting for us in
the conference room.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.100
Wait, what?

10:23.144 --> 10:23.927
Right now?

10:23.971 --> 10:25.146
Yes, now.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.495
[sighs]

10:26.538 --> 10:28.323
So who am I meeting?

10:28.366 --> 10:30.020
The top local event producer

10:30.064 --> 10:32.501
who's also done some
major work out of town.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.634
The publishers think he can
deliver exactly what we need.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.244
Great. What's his name?

10:36.287 --> 10:38.289
Rachel, I'd like you
to meet...

10:41.728 --> 10:44.034
Jack.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.558
So how did it work
out with the tie?

10:46.602 --> 10:48.299
Oh, it was a big, big hit.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.779
Wait a second, you two know
each other?

10:49.823 --> 10:51.694
Oh, yeah, yeah, we go way
back, like yesterday.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.130
Right.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.176
Jack needed my professional
opinion at the store.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.439
My, you were busy yesterday.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.484
Jack, do you have
your resumÃ©

10:59.528 --> 11:01.269
and a sample of your work?

11:04.315 --> 11:07.188
Creative producer
for live events,

11:07.231 --> 11:11.627
tour events and even some
of my favourite music.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.411
What're you doing
in this town?

11:13.455 --> 11:16.414
I guess you never know
where life takes you.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.461
And um, who is...
who is Paul Taylor?

11:19.504 --> 11:20.636
He's my associate.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.203
You know, right-hand man.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.726
You'll meet him soon enough.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.555
A portfolio like this means
you must be...

11:26.598 --> 11:28.731
married to your job?

11:28.775 --> 11:30.777
Work never complains
about my commitment issues.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.082
[chuckles]

11:32.126 --> 11:34.563
At least you're honest.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.173
Why don't we, um...
why don't we sit down?

11:36.217 --> 11:37.435
Great.

11:40.047 --> 11:44.181
Now, um... let me be honest.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.270
No one knows my brand
better than I do.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.576
Right.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.099
Can I tell you why
I took this job?

11:49.143 --> 11:51.841
I see potential in your event.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.452
That it can really make
a positive impact

11:54.496 --> 11:56.367
on this town and beyond.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.717
Potential?

11:57.760 --> 12:00.110
I mean, we're already making
a positive impact.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.156
Researching you
for the last 48 hours,

12:02.199 --> 12:06.334
there are a few things that
I suggest doing differently.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.944
I told you the red suit
on the cover made you look

12:07.988 --> 12:09.380
a little standoff-ish.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.730
The suit's the least
of your concerns.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.644
Can I be completely candid
with you right now?

12:12.688 --> 12:14.342
Oh, so that was you
not being candid?

12:14.385 --> 12:15.735
I saw you on the news
the other night.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.780
Even answering questions,
it just-

12:17.824 --> 12:21.653
it felt a little too planned.
Too clever.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.351
We do have a strategy when
it comes to selling Rachel's

12:23.394 --> 12:26.049
new book that we don't wanna
deviate from,

12:26.093 --> 12:27.703
which is why the Rachel
Kennedy's

12:27.747 --> 12:30.750
Inspiration Celebration event
has to be the best ever.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.101
I think the core message
for this event

12:34.144 --> 12:36.668
should maybe reflect
who you are.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.148
Helping others.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.497
Giving to others.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.109
Which means more involvement
in the community.

12:42.152 --> 12:46.113
In order to inspire you have
to connect on a deeper level.

12:46.156 --> 12:49.072
What better way to connect
and to celebrate

12:49.116 --> 12:51.422
than by making this event
more about Christmas

12:51.466 --> 12:54.861
than about some...
some image?

12:54.904 --> 12:57.428
May I also suggest adding
"Christmas" to the title?

12:57.472 --> 13:00.083
Maybe calling it "The Christmas
Inspiration Celebration"?

13:00.127 --> 13:01.519
Right.

13:01.563 --> 13:05.567
Well, see, Christmas is not
necessarily my fortÃ©.

13:08.048 --> 13:11.051
Ok. Maybe I'm not the best
person for this job.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.836
Maybe you're right.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.535
Ok. Well, I wish you the best of
luck with everything.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.362
Thank you.

13:18.406 --> 13:19.450
I hope it all goes well.

13:19.494 --> 13:20.669
Wait, no. Jack, just
one sec please.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.932
Rachel, can I talk to you
for a moment?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.935
Yes. Thank you.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.719
We'll just be a minute.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.812
Hey.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.118
What're you doing?

13:35.162 --> 13:37.120
I don't like his approach.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.774
Look, he's the only person
in this town

13:38.818 --> 13:41.298
with enough experience to make
this event successful.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.518
Well, I'm sure we can hire
someone else.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.128
You saw his resumÃ©.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.869
He ran his own company
in Boston.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.392
He knows what he's doing.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.438
Just for now,
for the publishers,

13:50.481 --> 13:52.614
let's see where
he takes this, ok?

13:58.185 --> 14:01.057
Ok, we can try to weave
a little bit of Christmas

14:01.101 --> 14:02.842
into the event.

14:02.885 --> 14:03.668
Ok, that's good news.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.887
Good, good, good.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.280
And see? Look at that.

14:06.323 --> 14:07.237
You're already getting
into the Christmas spirit.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.500
Nice. Ok, we should get started.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.893
Started with what?

14:10.937 --> 14:12.503
Oh, we wanna get you out there
among the people,

14:12.547 --> 14:14.549
soaking in the holiday...

14:14.592 --> 14:17.030
Have you ever been to the town
hot cocoa contest?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.293
I bet even you can't resist
a nice good cup of hot cocoa.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.947
Right, see, I've never really
understood that contest.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.384
I mean, how many ways are
there really to make it?

14:23.427 --> 14:24.994
I don't know.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.909
I guess we're gonna find out
because we are going tonight.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.346
And you're going with me
because this is all your idea.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.696
By the way, the only way I
know how to produce an event

14:31.740 --> 14:32.959
for someone is by getting
to know them

14:33.002 --> 14:35.091
so from now on
you're stuck with me.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.788
Fantastic.

14:36.832 --> 14:37.833
The coffee is spectacular.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.921
Every year they have
the best.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.314
Yeah, but- can you just-

14:40.357 --> 14:41.793
what brought you here
to Fall Oaks?

14:41.837 --> 14:43.708
Because it seems like
you've got a pretty successful

14:43.752 --> 14:45.580
career in Boston.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.191
Oh, this is it.
Hot cocoa contest.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.366
This is it?

14:49.410 --> 14:50.411
Get in there.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.021
Ok.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.070
How long have you been
managing Rachel?

14:57.113 --> 15:00.247
I've been with her
since her first book.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.726
"Spark the Fire Within."

15:01.770 --> 15:02.727
About five years now.

15:02.771 --> 15:03.946
Five. Wow.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.687
In our line of work
that's like a century.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.210
Tell me about it.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.908
It's been a little bit of
a roller coaster ride.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.953
Her second book "You Deserve
it All" didn't do as well

15:10.997 --> 15:12.781
as the publishers
would have liked,

15:12.824 --> 15:15.523
which is why we're doing such
a huge push on "Me First."

15:15.566 --> 15:17.742
And that's why you're here.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.440
This event will guarantee
that we get

15:19.483 --> 15:20.963
our publishing deal renewed.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.399
This is the start of
Rachel Kennedy

15:22.443 --> 15:25.228
becoming a household name
across the country.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.580
Is that what she wants?

15:29.624 --> 15:31.408
Isn't that what we all want?

15:35.586 --> 15:45.596
â™ª

15:45.640 --> 15:53.604
â™ª

16:35.255 --> 16:35.951
Hi.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.300
Excuse me?

16:37.344 --> 16:38.606
How can I help you?

16:38.649 --> 16:40.564
Hi, uh, my name is Rachel.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.305
I am looking for Joy.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.351
Well, nice to have you here,
Rachel.

16:44.394 --> 16:47.136
I'm Dennis, and
she's right over there.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.616
Follow me.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.226
Thank you.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.754
Wow, Joy, that
fruit looks great.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.408
I got to the warehouse early.

16:58.452 --> 17:01.020
They donated so much produce...

17:02.108 --> 17:02.891
Hello.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.632
Hi.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.895
Well, if you'll excuse me
I got a lot of work to do.

17:07.416 --> 17:09.593
I'm so sorry, I did follow
you but I just-

17:09.637 --> 17:12.117
I really felt like I needed
to see you again.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.858
Could I buy you
a cup of coffee?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.557
Well, we have coffee
right here.

17:16.599 --> 17:21.518
But first I have to unpack
the bakery goods for the kids.

17:21.561 --> 17:22.780
The kids?

17:25.479 --> 17:27.872
[kids laughing]

17:32.747 --> 17:34.401
I missed you, Joy!

17:34.444 --> 17:35.793
Oh, Natalie.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.447
You saw me yesterday.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.188
It felt like a month!

17:39.232 --> 17:42.713
Sometimes when we
really miss someone

17:42.757 --> 17:46.195
it can seem like forever.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.936
I missed you, too.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.720
I miss all my kids.

17:49.764 --> 17:50.069
â™ª

17:51.070 --> 17:53.159
â™ª Dashing through
the snow, â™ª

17:53.202 --> 17:56.423
â™ª In a one horse open sleigh,

17:56.466 --> 17:59.208
â™ª Over the hills we go,

17:59.252 --> 18:02.124
â™ª Laughing all the way,

18:02.168 --> 18:05.084
â™ª Bells on bobtails ring,

18:05.127 --> 18:07.738
â™ª Making spirits bright,

18:07.782 --> 18:10.611
â™ª What fun it is to laugh
and sing â™ª

18:10.654 --> 18:13.004
â™ª a sleighing song tonight

18:13.048 --> 18:14.397
How long have you known Joy for?

18:14.441 --> 18:17.661
Actually, we just met.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.750
She saved my life.

18:19.794 --> 18:23.232
Joy has a... tendency
to do that.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.146
Mmmhmm.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.278
It's her gift.

18:25.321 --> 18:26.888
She's been teaching
music to these

18:26.931 --> 18:28.977
children for many
years now,

18:29.020 --> 18:30.979
making sure they
all leave with a smile

18:31.022 --> 18:32.633
on their face every day.

18:32.676 --> 18:35.636
Yeah, I can see that.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.203
â™ª ... one-horse open sleigh.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.901
It breaks my heart to think
that this is all going away.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.685
What do you mean,
"going away"?

18:41.729 --> 18:44.645
We just don't have
the funding anymore.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.864
So it looks like we'll be
closing the doors

18:46.908 --> 18:48.344
at the end of the year.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.955
What about these children?

18:50.999 --> 18:52.174
I don't know.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.349
[message alert]

18:53.393 --> 18:55.046
Oh, excuse me.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.613
I'm sorry.

19:01.009 --> 19:03.794
â™ª Jingle bells,
jingle bells â™ª

19:03.838 --> 19:06.362
â™ª Jingle all the way...

19:10.540 --> 19:13.195
Um, I guess the reason I wrote "Spark the Fire Within"

19:13.239 --> 19:16.067
was to get a grasp
on my life.

19:16.111 --> 19:20.202
When my dad passed away I...
I felt helpless.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.857
I had to redefine myself,

19:22.900 --> 19:25.599
not just as like a girl
with a successful blog,

19:25.642 --> 19:30.995
but as a voice for those
who were hurting like me.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.217
[Joy]: Make yourself at home.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.566
I'll just be a minute.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.959
[Rachel]: Ok, no problem.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.244
Oh, that's so long ago.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.028
As promised.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.117
Fresh, hot cider.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.772
Thank you.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.426
Were you a classical pianist?

20:10.470 --> 20:15.083
Yes, I was with the East
Massachusetts Philharmonic,

20:15.126 --> 20:18.478
briefly, until uh...

20:18.521 --> 20:21.437
Until what?

20:21.481 --> 20:25.180
I moved to Fall Oaks.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.009
It was not an easy time
for me.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.402
But when I got here

20:29.445 --> 20:33.362
the community centre
really helped me through it,

20:33.406 --> 20:36.452
so now I help others
do the same.

20:38.933 --> 20:42.806
Oh, I know what's missing.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.026
Christmas cookies.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.828
Oh, lovely.

21:04.872 --> 21:07.309
This was my favourite book
when I was growing up.

21:07.353 --> 21:11.095
My parents used to read it
to my brother and I, um,

21:11.139 --> 21:11.966
all of the time.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.010
Oh.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.490
Does your brother
still live here?

21:14.534 --> 21:15.796
In Fall Oaks?

21:15.839 --> 21:18.233
Yes, he does, but,
you know, we- um,

21:18.277 --> 21:21.845
I still haven't had the chance
to see him yet.

21:21.889 --> 21:25.109
Really? Why not?

21:29.157 --> 21:31.638
Um... uh, he um- I just,
you know, I've uh,

21:31.681 --> 21:33.640
I've been busy with the event
and, you know, everything.

21:33.683 --> 21:39.515
I'm sure you're very busy
but he's family.

21:39.559 --> 21:43.954
We make time for what we
wanna make time for, right?

21:48.045 --> 21:49.525
This may seem out
of the ordinary

21:49.569 --> 21:54.269
but I could use your help.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.359
With what?

21:57.403 --> 22:03.191
The work that you do
is special and important.

22:03.234 --> 22:06.803
It inspires me and it reminds me

22:06.847 --> 22:11.460
of why I wanted to make a
difference in the first place.

22:11.504 --> 22:14.942
I could just really use
your help.

22:14.985 --> 22:21.862
I think maybe your idea of
helping people,

22:21.905 --> 22:25.344
um, may be a little different
from my own.

22:28.129 --> 22:31.175
Ok, I understand.

22:33.134 --> 22:38.531
If you change your mind
or if you need anything,

22:38.574 --> 22:41.534
you contact me.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.405
Hmm.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.711
Ok.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.452
Ok.

22:46.495 --> 22:48.454
Do you know how much we spent
on that composer?

22:48.497 --> 22:50.804
Do you know how much music
can affect your audience?

22:50.847 --> 22:52.762
So, what? You're saying
that I need new entrance

22:52.806 --> 22:53.720
and exit music?

22:53.763 --> 22:54.547
Yeah.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.461
Why?

22:55.504 --> 22:57.114
Because it's stale and aloof.

22:57.158 --> 23:00.509
And you are neither of those
things, most of the time.

23:00.553 --> 23:01.423
Excuse me?

23:01.467 --> 23:02.946
Look at this.

23:04.774 --> 23:05.427
[recording] I had
to redefine myself-

23:05.471 --> 23:06.776
That's the girl.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.996
As a voice for those
who were hurting like me.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.867
That is the message
we have to get back to.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.391
Where did that girl go?

23:12.434 --> 23:14.436
Stuart and the publishers
wanted something different.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.829
And if my publishers
are happy

23:15.872 --> 23:17.439
that means that I'm happy.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.658
R- really?

23:18.701 --> 23:20.050
You'd rather make
your publishers happy

23:20.094 --> 23:24.403
than actually help people
who need your help?

23:24.446 --> 23:25.578
Ok, fine.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.188
What do you- what do
you have in mind?

23:27.231 --> 23:29.233
As I said, I think we should
focus on the Christmas spirit.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.888
No. I have already told you,
Christmas is not my fortÃ©.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.237
Why do you keep saying that?

23:33.281 --> 23:34.891
Because Christmas is ha-

23:34.935 --> 23:38.939
because it's hard when you've
lost people that you love.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.724
And, you know, being home
doesn't help.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.641
I'm sorry.

23:45.685 --> 23:48.209
No, it's fine, let's just-
let's just focus on the event.

23:49.645 --> 23:52.039
So what do you-
what do you suggest?

23:54.389 --> 23:56.435
What do I suggest?

24:00.134 --> 24:01.875
Something like...

24:01.918 --> 24:03.877
â™ª

24:03.920 --> 24:06.270
â™ª God rest ye merry gentlemen,

24:06.314 --> 24:08.838
â™ª Let nothing you dismay,

24:08.882 --> 24:14.278
â™ª Rachel Kennedy has come
to save the day! â™ª

24:14.322 --> 24:16.672
[strumming]

24:16.716 --> 24:18.021
Yeah, maybe no lyrics.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.370
No lyrics.

24:19.414 --> 24:22.286
[laughs]

24:22.330 --> 24:23.592
Joy is waiting for you.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.948
There she is.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.385
Hi.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.170
You must be Joy.

24:36.213 --> 24:36.953
Yes.

24:36.997 --> 24:37.780
I'm Jack.

24:37.824 --> 24:38.694
Nice to meet you.

24:38.738 --> 24:39.782
Hi, Jack.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.784
Joy. You came.

24:41.828 --> 24:43.656
Anyway, uh, Merry Christmas.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.440
Well, Merry Christmas
to you.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.399
I'll see you tomorrow with
equally impressive lyrics.

24:48.443 --> 24:51.620
I can't wait.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.231
He seems like a really
nice fella.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.496
Yeah. He is.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.584
Please.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.107
Yes.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.067
I've been thinking
about your offer.

25:04.111 --> 25:07.723
Um, what is it exactly that
you would want me to do?

25:07.767 --> 25:09.943
Keep me on track.

25:09.986 --> 25:12.336
Keep me on message.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.295
Like an advisor.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.558
Ah.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.343
An advisor.

25:19.387 --> 25:23.173
Well, you reached out to me
asking me to help you

25:23.217 --> 25:25.959
and I always try to be there
for people who need me,

25:26.002 --> 25:27.961
so I'm in.

25:28.004 --> 25:29.919
To help you.

25:29.963 --> 25:30.703
Really?

25:30.746 --> 25:32.008
Yes.

25:32.052 --> 25:34.010
Fantastic.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.229
I have one condition though.

25:35.272 --> 25:36.578
Absolutely. Anything.

25:36.622 --> 25:39.538
I want you to join me
at the community centre.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.148
Well, I'm not sure
that I have the time

25:41.191 --> 25:42.497
but I was going to tell you

25:42.541 --> 25:44.847
that I would love to make
a sizable donation.

25:44.891 --> 25:47.850
Time is more valuable
than money.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.203
You're right.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.295
What's your estimate, Paul?

25:58.339 --> 26:00.210
Looks like they've upgraded their lighting package in here.

26:00.254 --> 26:00.950
Yep.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.212
Good.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.301
We'll start building
in the cues tomorrow.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.566
[yawning]

26:07.609 --> 26:08.523
Oh man, go home.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.091
Spend some time
with your wife.

26:11.134 --> 26:13.223
My wife and I thank you.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.790
We're probably gonna
order some pizza.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.052
You wanna come?

26:16.096 --> 26:17.576
Thank you but no,

26:17.619 --> 26:19.403
I got a couple more things
I wanna work on.

26:19.447 --> 26:20.927
[laughs]

26:20.970 --> 26:23.059
There's a reason you don't
have a girlfriend, boss.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.147
Take it easy, buddy.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.496
See you, man.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.243
You really think
it's a good idea

26:33.287 --> 26:34.984
to have the Christmas party
at the place I'm staying at?

26:35.028 --> 26:35.985
It'll be perfect.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.334
Get everyone
out of the office.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.379
Don't worry, I'll keep
the guest list small.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.423
Oh, and by the way,

26:39.467 --> 26:41.469
make sure that Joy
is on the list.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.514
Joy, the woman who saved
you the other day?

26:43.558 --> 26:46.387
Yeah. Oh, and by the way,
she is now part of the team.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.346
Woah. Wait, when
did that happen?

26:49.390 --> 26:51.697
Earlier today.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.263
Why didn't we discuss this?

26:53.307 --> 26:55.004
We just did.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.005
[message alert]

26:56.049 --> 26:57.050
Alright.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.662
Jack? He's taking this
"getting to know you " thing

27:00.706 --> 27:02.708
a little seriously, huh?

27:02.751 --> 27:04.840
[giggles]

27:04.884 --> 27:06.755
Seriously?

27:06.799 --> 27:08.409
You're giggling
and walking away?

27:08.452 --> 27:10.629
Have a good night.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.766
â™ª

27:17.810 --> 27:18.506
Hey.

27:18.549 --> 27:19.376
Hey.

27:19.420 --> 27:20.769
I'm surprised you said yes.

27:20.813 --> 27:22.641
Well, actually, you're kinda
saving me.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.121
If I had to listen to Stuart
go over the party guest list

27:25.165 --> 27:26.383
one more time...

27:26.427 --> 27:29.082
I- I just thought a
little more festival...

27:29.125 --> 27:30.344
What, would get me
in the Christmas spirit?

27:30.387 --> 27:31.824
Yes.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.695
You're trying to make Christmas
my fortÃ©, aren't you?

27:33.739 --> 27:34.696
[laughs]

27:34.740 --> 27:35.349
Come on.

27:35.392 --> 27:36.393
Ok.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.049
Don't be shy with it, really.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.703
That's it.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.965
I'm trying to but I think that
if you push it closer together

27:43.009 --> 27:43.662
then it's gonna-

27:43.705 --> 27:44.358
Well, no, I am.

27:44.401 --> 27:45.098
I'm trying.

27:45.141 --> 27:46.403
It's just-

27:46.447 --> 27:47.361
Ok, I'm sorry but is he-
is he doing this right?

27:47.404 --> 27:48.710
Get more in there.

27:48.754 --> 27:49.668
I know, I have-

27:49.711 --> 27:51.191
[snap]

27:51.234 --> 27:52.540
That's what I was
worried about.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.107
If you push it, it's gonna
break, and it's ok.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.369
It's more fun to-

27:55.412 --> 27:57.197
it's more fun to eat
than to build with.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.199
I don't think this is baked.

27:59.242 --> 28:00.026
It's not baked?

28:00.069 --> 28:00.679
I don't think it's baked.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.028
Is it even edible?

28:02.071 --> 28:04.508
No. Let's go get something
to wash that down with.

28:04.552 --> 28:05.727
[giggling]

28:05.771 --> 28:06.946
Hi there, good evening.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.339
Uh, two Christmas Tinsel
Teas, please.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.906
Christmas Tinsel Tea?

28:10.950 --> 28:12.473
I saw you both from
across the way.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.214
We have a problem
and I need your help.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.432
What?

28:15.476 --> 28:16.346
One of the teams in
the candy cane relay

28:16.390 --> 28:17.739
had to cancel last minute.

28:17.783 --> 28:18.479
The candy cane-

28:18.522 --> 28:19.306
The what?

28:19.349 --> 28:20.307
The relay.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.612
Would you two mind
jumping in?

28:21.656 --> 28:22.744
I don't think-

28:22.788 --> 28:24.093
Candy cane relay?

28:24.137 --> 28:24.833
Yes sir.

28:24.877 --> 28:25.660
Wonderful.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.748
Yes.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.359
Ok.

28:29.403 --> 28:31.144
So what you're saying is
that I'm going to spin around

28:31.187 --> 28:33.581
on this candy cane
five times and then

28:33.624 --> 28:35.626
I'm gonna run down there to that
big candy cane

28:35.670 --> 28:37.411
and go around that candy cane,
come back here,

28:37.454 --> 28:39.369
I give you the candy cane
and then-

28:39.413 --> 28:40.153
And then it's my turn.

28:40.196 --> 28:40.849
Your turn.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.764
It's called a relay.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.766
It's like a relay bad idea.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.942
Oh, ooh, impressive.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.683
That was... wow.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.947
[cheering]

28:51.991 --> 28:54.036
Alright, ready?

28:54.080 --> 28:55.255
Set!

28:55.298 --> 28:57.779
Ho, ho, go!

28:58.475 --> 28:59.781
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

28:59.825 --> 29:01.391
Ok, slow down, not too fast,
not too fast.

29:01.435 --> 29:02.741
You're gonna focus
on something stable

29:02.784 --> 29:03.480
when you come up.

29:03.524 --> 29:04.264
How many has it been?

29:04.307 --> 29:05.091
That's it, that's five!

29:05.134 --> 29:05.831
Go, go, go!

29:05.874 --> 29:06.962
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

29:07.006 --> 29:07.876
That's it, that's it.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.138
Go, go, go!

29:17.277 --> 29:18.408
Go, go, go!

29:18.452 --> 29:19.453
That's five, that's five,
that's five!

29:19.496 --> 29:20.367
No, no, no!

29:20.410 --> 29:21.977
Go this way!
Go this way!

29:24.023 --> 29:25.894
Go, Jack! Go!

29:25.938 --> 29:31.117
[cheering]

29:31.160 --> 29:33.075
Yes!

29:34.860 --> 29:35.817
We have our winners!

29:35.861 --> 29:38.864
[cheering]

29:41.867 --> 29:43.433
Oh my goodness.

29:43.477 --> 29:46.349
[laughing]

29:55.054 --> 29:58.187
Oh... I think
I'm still spinning.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.101
Me too.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.102
[laughs]

30:00.146 --> 30:02.365
There you go.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.849
Oh, hmm.

30:07.893 --> 30:11.200
Well, um, this is me.

30:11.244 --> 30:12.375
Oh, no.

30:12.419 --> 30:12.985
What?

30:13.028 --> 30:13.812
No decorations?

30:13.855 --> 30:15.248
You're that house?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.815
You're that house.

30:16.858 --> 30:17.380
Mmmhmm.

30:17.424 --> 30:18.338
This won't do.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.948
What won't do?

30:24.518 --> 30:25.388
Fire it up.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.694
Ok. Ready?

30:26.737 --> 30:27.173
[gasps]

30:27.216 --> 30:28.565
Bam.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.831
Oh yeah, look at that.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.310
We got lots to do. Come on.
Let's go!

30:48.498 --> 30:50.326
It's a good looking tree.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.024
Yeah.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.982
I actually think that this
might be the best one

30:54.026 --> 30:56.942
that I have ever had.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.901
Actually, when I was young
I used to always choose the tree

30:59.945 --> 31:02.425
that I thought that no one else
would ever want.

31:02.469 --> 31:06.038
You know, so that they would
have a home for Christmas, too.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.910
And my whole family would
always laugh at me

31:08.954 --> 31:12.783
but those misfit trees
always came home with us.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.263
I think that's awesome.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.831
Yeah.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.835
It's been a long time
since I've done this.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.185
Since my dad passed away.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.796
And he had a knack
for gaudy decorations.

31:25.840 --> 31:29.191
He had one of those plastic
Santa Clauses that came up

31:29.235 --> 31:30.671
from the chimney.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.020
Oh yeah. I know the exact one
you're talking about.

31:32.064 --> 31:32.760
Right?

31:32.803 --> 31:33.892
Yep.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.067
I swear that any plane
that passed by

31:35.110 --> 31:37.852
could see that monstrosity.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.811
Oh, and he was
so proud of it.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.860
I haven't thought
about that in so long.

31:46.992 --> 31:50.952
You know, losing my mom
and my dad and the memories

31:50.996 --> 31:55.261
they created for my brother,
David, and me.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.916
I miss that.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.961
I miss that a lot.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.963
But it's nice being able
to remember it

32:02.007 --> 32:06.141
and actually smile about it,
you know?

32:06.185 --> 32:07.969
What about you?

32:08.013 --> 32:11.451
Was Christmas like a...
a big deal in your family?

32:11.494 --> 32:13.148
Oh gosh, yeah.
It sure was.

32:13.192 --> 32:17.239
Was? Past tense?

32:17.283 --> 32:19.981
I lost both of my parents,
too.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.418
I'm so sorry.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.551
Thanks.

32:24.594 --> 32:28.903
It was uh... it was hard
for a long time.

32:28.947 --> 32:33.995
You know, not having...
not having any family anymore.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.388
And I was an only child.

32:35.431 --> 32:38.434
They were both older when
they adopted me, so...

32:38.478 --> 32:39.696
You were adopted?

32:39.740 --> 32:40.697
Yeah.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.003
When I was a baby.

32:42.047 --> 32:47.008
My parents were...
they were amazing.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.793
They never made me feel like
I wasn't part of them.

32:49.837 --> 32:53.580
Hmm. But I still wondered.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.321
What do you wonder?

32:55.364 --> 32:57.149
Just, you know,
where I came from.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.020
My biological parents.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.195
Who they were.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.718
Why did they give me up?

33:01.762 --> 33:03.982
Just... you never stop.

33:04.025 --> 33:06.027
I didn't.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.029
Do you ever think about
trying to find them?

33:08.073 --> 33:09.378
Sure.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.554
Yeah, a lot more now.

33:11.598 --> 33:13.034
Since mom and dad passed

33:13.078 --> 33:16.646
the idea of having
family out there...

33:16.690 --> 33:21.042
you know, makes it
feel a little less-

33:21.086 --> 33:23.914
a little less alone
in this big world.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.046
Yeah.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.005
So yeah, I do wanna find
them someday.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.443
Rachel Kennedy,
I'm telling you,

33:30.486 --> 33:32.706
if this event tanks

33:32.749 --> 33:36.275
we can definitely fall back on
our interior decorating skills.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.842
Or, you know, we could um,

33:38.886 --> 33:42.324
also maybe go pro in
candy cane relay races.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.631
[laughing]

33:49.418 --> 33:52.247
You know, I um...
I have this rule

33:52.291 --> 33:55.381
about getting involved with
people that I work with.

33:55.424 --> 33:56.338
Yes.

33:56.382 --> 33:57.600
It's absolutely fine.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.254
I um... there's- we have
a lot to do.

33:59.298 --> 34:00.821
Yeah.

34:00.864 --> 34:04.694
You know, work always comes...
first.

34:32.547 --> 34:35.246
[knocking]

34:35.290 --> 34:36.552
I got it.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.123
David, hi.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.777
Hi.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.954
I was wondering if you'd
ever come by.

34:46.996 --> 34:49.478
Yeah, I was just waiting
for the right time.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.393
Oh yeah?

34:51.437 --> 34:53.351
How long you been in town?

34:56.268 --> 34:58.008
Oh, right.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.054
Well, I'd invite you in but
Suzie and I were about

35:00.098 --> 35:01.795
to take the kids to school.

35:01.838 --> 35:04.711
It's the last day
before Christmas break, so...

35:04.754 --> 35:05.886
[Suzie]: David, we gotta go,
we're late!

35:05.929 --> 35:07.105
Right. Right, yeah.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.542
Um, yeah. I'll let you go.

35:09.585 --> 35:12.980
I'm- I shouldn't have come
by unannounced, anyway.

35:13.023 --> 35:15.896
Well, it's good to have
you back,

35:15.939 --> 35:19.856
and uh, good luck with the event
and everything.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.771
Thanks.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.295
Okay.

35:23.338 --> 35:26.341
Um, and I'm uh, I'm having
a Christmas party, you know,

35:26.385 --> 35:28.691
if you were around and you

35:28.735 --> 35:30.998
and the family wanted
to stop by.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.261
David! David, come on!

35:33.305 --> 35:36.438
You know, it's a pretty busy
time for all of us right now.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.311
Right. Of course.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.617
Anyway, have a good morning.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.010
Thanks, you too.

35:43.053 --> 35:45.230
Merry Christmas, Rach.

35:50.539 --> 35:54.064
And, it's like I said in chapter four in "Me First."

35:54.108 --> 35:56.154
The true path to success

35:56.197 --> 35:59.200
is clearing away any
unnecessary distractions

35:59.244 --> 36:01.289
and putting yourself first.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.638
Why do you think airlines

36:02.682 --> 36:05.163
tell you to put on your own
oxygen mask first?

36:05.206 --> 36:07.556
Because if you don't
take care of you,

36:07.600 --> 36:10.429
how can you take care of others?

36:10.472 --> 36:15.999
You cannot make anyone happy
until you're happy.

36:16.043 --> 36:22.789
When I finally did this for
myself my whole world changed.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.966
I'm sorry, Joy, what is it?

36:26.009 --> 36:30.623
I'm not sure this is the exact
kind of message

36:30.666 --> 36:34.148
we wanna send
at Christmas time,

36:34.192 --> 36:36.629
or at any time,
for that matter.

36:36.672 --> 36:40.937
Right, I know, um, but
this is directly from my book.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.678
I think it sounds great.

36:42.722 --> 36:44.811
Hey, there he is.

36:44.854 --> 36:48.118
Joy, I'd like you to meet Austin
Holberg of Holberg Publishing,

36:48.162 --> 36:49.207
our publishing house.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.120
Hello.

36:50.164 --> 36:51.034
Pleasure to meet you.

36:51.078 --> 36:51.818
Joy, is it?

36:51.861 --> 36:53.863
Yes.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.256
I'm sorry, Joy, you were saying?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.997
Oh, I think we've heard enough.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.869
Go ahead. I'd like you to finish
your thought.

37:02.350 --> 37:07.268
The thing you say about airplane
passengers and oxygen?

37:07.312 --> 37:09.749
It's counter-intuitive
to help yourself

37:09.792 --> 37:12.404
before you help someone else.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.363
That's why they
instruct you to do so.

37:15.407 --> 37:21.848
It's an exception to the way
people should behave.

37:21.891 --> 37:24.459
And Christmas is a time
of giving.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.766
We all know that.

37:26.809 --> 37:30.291
And giving can cause
a ripple effect,

37:30.335 --> 37:32.380
and I think it-

37:32.424 --> 37:35.731
it should be the message
that we're sending.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.082
That's interesting.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.519
I like that.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.303
I think I'm gonna- I'm gonna
think about that.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.262
Rachel?

37:44.305 --> 37:46.176
If you'll excuse me.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.700
Alright. I'll call you.

37:47.743 --> 37:50.050
Rachel, can I uh, have a moment
with you please?

37:50.093 --> 37:51.573
Just a sec.

37:57.144 --> 37:59.712
Austin is one of the most
important publishers around.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.323
He's flown in in support
of your event.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.498
We agreed to a plan
with him.

38:03.542 --> 38:04.978
You need to stick to it.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.807
You know, ever since
Joy has been around

38:07.850 --> 38:09.156
you seem distracted.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.201
You know what, Stuart?

38:11.245 --> 38:14.640
For years I have been going
a mile a minute,

38:14.683 --> 38:15.815
always focusing on work

38:15.858 --> 38:18.600
so don't talk to me
about distraction.

38:18.644 --> 38:21.516
Look, this could be
our biggest deal yet.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.518
All you gotta do is play along
with what Austin

38:23.562 --> 38:25.259
and the other publishers want
your message to be.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.434
That's it.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.569
Rachel.

38:33.223 --> 38:34.181
I will be right there.

38:34.224 --> 38:36.618
I will figure something out.

38:36.662 --> 38:37.706
Ok.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.103
I hope I didn't speak
out of line before.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.496
No, no, no.

38:44.539 --> 38:45.845
Not at all.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.716
This is the reason
that I have you here.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.718
They need me at
the community centre.

38:49.762 --> 38:51.633
There's a little bit of
an emergency.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.113
Oh no, what is it?

38:53.156 --> 38:56.159
Our annual Christmas party
is about to be cancelled.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.032
The money just isn't there.

38:59.075 --> 39:02.557
The families and the children,
they really need this party.

39:02.601 --> 39:03.384
You know what?

39:03.428 --> 39:04.994
I think I have an idea.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.170
Reggie, hey.

39:09.303 --> 39:10.783
Good.

39:10.826 --> 39:13.351
Listen, um, I need you to do
a background check for me.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.484
Her first name is Joy.

39:18.225 --> 39:28.191
â™ª

39:28.235 --> 39:38.201
â™ª

39:39.594 --> 39:41.640
â™ª Dashing through the snow

39:41.683 --> 39:43.555
â™ª In a one-horse opened sleigh

39:43.598 --> 39:46.775
Can you take this for me?
This is just delicious.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.473
Thank you again so much.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.039
â™ª...laughing all the way â™ª

39:51.084 --> 39:52.302
Hey.

39:52.694 --> 39:53.869
Hey.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.349
What're you doing here?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.220
I talked to Bridget,
she told me what you guys

39:57.264 --> 39:59.875
are doing out here so I just
came by to lend a hand.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.008
Wow, that's- that's great.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.662
Actually I just saw Paul
in the kitchen.

40:03.705 --> 40:04.489
Oh, nice.

40:04.532 --> 40:05.403
He said he was gonna come.

40:05.446 --> 40:06.491
Good.

40:06.534 --> 40:07.230
I uh, I brought some
reinforcements,

40:07.274 --> 40:08.971
so put me to work, boss.

40:09.015 --> 40:12.540
Well, actually, today I'm...
I'm not your boss.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.716
Ok, what are you?

40:14.760 --> 40:17.589
Um, do you have
any kitchen skills?

40:17.632 --> 40:19.982
I'm a little bit better at this
than the bussing tables.

40:20.026 --> 40:21.419
Yeah?

40:21.462 --> 40:22.463
Well, then I think maybe
you should stick with that.

40:22.507 --> 40:23.508
Great. I'm gonna
get to work then.

40:23.551 --> 40:24.422
Ok.

40:24.465 --> 40:25.727
Jack?

40:26.162 --> 40:27.468
Yeah?

40:28.774 --> 40:30.166
Nothing.

40:30.210 --> 40:31.472
You ok?

40:31.516 --> 40:32.734
Yeah, yeah.

40:32.778 --> 40:35.824
I'm... never been better.

40:36.564 --> 40:37.739
Good.

40:38.261 --> 40:49.142
â™ª

40:49.185 --> 40:50.535
â™ª Jingle Bells, â™ª

40:50.578 --> 40:51.884
â™ª Jingle Bells, â™ª

40:51.927 --> 40:54.669
â™ª Jingle all the way, â™ª

40:54.713 --> 40:57.150
â™ª Oh what fun it is to ride, â™ª

40:57.193 --> 41:01.371
â™ª In a one-horse open sleigh â™ª

41:01.415 --> 41:06.725
[applause]

41:06.768 --> 41:09.118
It's so nice of Jack to come by
and help out.

41:09.162 --> 41:10.816
Yeah.

41:10.859 --> 41:13.775
I didn't even ask him,
he just kind of...

41:13.819 --> 41:15.951
showed up.

41:27.789 --> 41:29.748
I've been trying to reach
you all day.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.706
There's some things you need
to sign for for your party.

41:31.750 --> 41:34.230
Ok. Well, once I'm done here
I'll get to it.

41:34.274 --> 41:35.797
But you need to sign
for them now.

41:35.841 --> 41:40.323
Like I said, as soon as I'm done
here I will take care of it.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.377
[phone ringing]

41:50.420 --> 41:53.119
Reggie, what have
you got for me?

42:02.476 --> 42:08.221
[humming]
â™ª

42:08.264 --> 42:09.875
What is that that
you're singing?

42:09.918 --> 42:11.441
It's called
"Christmas Memories."

42:11.485 --> 42:13.139
I don't think I know that one.

42:13.182 --> 42:14.140
No?

42:14.183 --> 42:17.317
â™ª Christmas Memories â™ª

42:17.360 --> 42:19.580
â™ª of happy years gone- â™ª

42:19.624 --> 42:20.276
nothing?

42:20.320 --> 42:21.451
â™ª Gone by. â™ª

42:21.495 --> 42:22.104
[laughs]

42:22.148 --> 42:23.149
Nothing.

42:23.192 --> 42:24.063
I'll sing the whole thing
for you.

42:24.106 --> 42:24.977
Oh, really?

42:25.020 --> 42:26.021
It's an obscure one.

42:26.065 --> 42:27.545
I have this old cassette tape.

42:27.588 --> 42:28.894
Um, some people

42:28.937 --> 42:31.026
my parents knew recorded it
and every Christmas

42:31.070 --> 42:32.375
they listened to it
over and over

42:32.419 --> 42:33.986
and over again.

42:34.029 --> 42:36.379
Yeah, I still have a tape deck
just to listen to that tape.

42:36.423 --> 42:37.467
You do?

42:37.511 --> 42:38.338
Yeah, I listen to it
all the time.

42:38.381 --> 42:40.383
I love it.

42:40.427 --> 42:41.602
It's uh, one of my favourite
Christmas songs

42:41.646 --> 42:42.690
since I can remember.

42:42.734 --> 42:43.822
Well, I like it.

42:43.865 --> 42:44.823
It's nice.

42:44.866 --> 42:47.042
Do you know what else
is nice?

42:47.086 --> 42:49.262
What?

42:49.305 --> 42:50.568
Today.

42:50.611 --> 42:52.004
Today was nice.

42:53.527 --> 42:55.877
Yeah. It was.

42:59.098 --> 43:00.447
You know what?

43:00.490 --> 43:04.973
I um... I think you may have
missed a spot there.

43:05.017 --> 43:06.453
Really? Really?

43:06.496 --> 43:08.063
Yeah. Just a little.

43:08.107 --> 43:09.804
A tiny little spot.

43:09.848 --> 43:10.805
That's weird.

43:10.849 --> 43:12.459
I thought I got it all.

43:12.502 --> 43:13.547
Oh, wait, no.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.766
There's just a little
left on you.

43:14.809 --> 43:15.723
Do I have something-

43:15.767 --> 43:16.768
is there something there?

43:16.811 --> 43:17.595
No. No, you're good now.

43:17.638 --> 43:18.073
I got it.

43:18.117 --> 43:20.641
[giggles]

43:20.685 --> 43:21.903
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:21.947 --> 43:23.688
I didn't know you all were-

43:23.731 --> 43:25.167
I was standing here-

43:25.211 --> 43:26.647
No, it's good.

43:26.691 --> 43:28.127
Um, Paul said he's waiting
for you in the auditorium.

43:28.170 --> 43:30.346
He said you all had cues
to go over?

43:30.390 --> 43:32.044
Oh, cues for the event.

43:32.087 --> 43:33.001
Yeah, no, it's good.

43:33.045 --> 43:33.741
I'm fine.

43:33.785 --> 43:35.003
You wanna- you go, I'll-

43:35.047 --> 43:35.917
Are you sure?

43:35.961 --> 43:37.092
Yeah, no, I'll finish up here.

43:37.136 --> 43:38.267
Yeah, I gotta go.

43:38.311 --> 43:39.225
Ok.

43:40.008 --> 43:41.967
[laughs]

43:42.010 --> 43:43.098
What?

43:45.884 --> 43:46.841
Rachel?

43:46.885 --> 43:48.408
Yeah?

43:48.451 --> 43:51.237
Do you have any further plans
for the evening?

43:51.280 --> 43:52.673
No.

43:52.717 --> 43:54.893
I just- I have um, I'm just
gonna finish these pans

43:54.936 --> 43:57.330
and I just have a little work
to do, that's it.

43:57.373 --> 44:01.639
Would you want to help me
decorate some ornaments?

44:01.682 --> 44:03.379
I made Russian
butterball cookies.

44:03.423 --> 44:05.860
Russian butterball cookies
are my absolute favourite.

44:05.904 --> 44:07.470
I would love to.

44:07.514 --> 44:09.124
Excellent.

44:10.822 --> 44:13.476
I used to decorate
Christmas ornaments

44:13.520 --> 44:16.654
with my mom, my dad,
and David.

44:16.697 --> 44:18.612
It's actually one of
my favourite memories.

44:18.656 --> 44:21.006
Have you reached out
to David?

44:21.049 --> 44:25.010
Yeah, I actually went by
his house.

44:25.053 --> 44:26.315
How'd that go?

44:26.359 --> 44:29.318
Not too well.

44:29.362 --> 44:32.104
But, you know,
what did I expect?

44:32.147 --> 44:34.715
What happened
between the two of you?

44:38.501 --> 44:45.900
Um... when my dad passed
I just had to get away

44:45.944 --> 44:47.902
from everything.

44:47.946 --> 44:51.123
You know, everything
reminded me of him

44:51.166 --> 44:59.435
and so I went away as far
as I could to Los Angeles

44:59.479 --> 45:03.439
and David stayed with my mom.

45:03.483 --> 45:05.050
I sent them money.

45:05.093 --> 45:10.925
I thought that that was like
my way of helping out I guess.

45:10.969 --> 45:16.409
I came back for my mom's funeral
and then I left again.

45:16.452 --> 45:19.020
I think David still holds
that against me.

45:19.064 --> 45:22.937
Well, you have to make
that right.

45:26.201 --> 45:28.421
I think it's a little late
for that.

45:28.464 --> 45:34.253
It's never too late
to make things right.

45:34.296 --> 45:37.647
If you have even
the slightest chance

45:37.691 --> 45:41.434
of having family
in your life,

45:41.477 --> 45:45.960
you don't throw that away,
Rachel.

45:46.004 --> 45:48.963
You know, sometimes I just...

45:49.007 --> 45:50.791
I wish that I could just wake up

45:50.835 --> 45:54.926
and have a second chance
with David.

45:54.969 --> 45:57.798
Don't you know
what they say?

45:57.842 --> 46:01.323
Every day is a second chance.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.624
[Voicemail] Hi, you've reached
the Kennedys.

46:41.668 --> 46:45.454
Please leave a message after
the beep. Merry Christmas!!

46:45.498 --> 46:46.542
[beep]

46:46.586 --> 46:52.157
Hey, David, it's um...
it's Rachel.

46:52.200 --> 46:59.860
I um... I'm just calling
to say that I love you

46:59.904 --> 47:08.826
and I'm sorry
for everything.

47:08.869 --> 47:11.741
Anyway, um...

47:11.785 --> 47:13.961
Merry Christmas.

47:22.056 --> 47:29.585
[carols playing]
â™ª

47:29.629 --> 47:31.892
Did you try the chocolate cake?

47:31.936 --> 47:34.112
Oh, I'm allergic to chocolate.

47:34.155 --> 47:35.940
Oh, me too.

47:38.029 --> 47:39.813
It's been a pleasure working
with you, Rachel.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.510
Oh, you too.

47:41.554 --> 47:42.903
Hi.

47:42.947 --> 47:45.340
Would you like some cheesecake?

47:45.384 --> 47:47.777
Uh, yeah. Maybe.

47:47.821 --> 47:50.563
I love this suit,
by the way.

47:50.606 --> 47:52.913
Oh, thanks. This old thing?

47:52.957 --> 47:57.265
But I think I'm loving
the tie even more.

47:57.309 --> 47:58.527
You look sensational.

47:58.571 --> 48:01.095
Yeah?

48:01.139 --> 48:03.445
So you gonna ask me
to dance, then?

48:03.489 --> 48:05.447
Yes, I am.

48:08.581 --> 48:10.017
Would you like to dance?

48:10.061 --> 48:12.019
I thought you'd never ask.

48:16.110 --> 48:20.506
So how does this party compare
to your fancy LA parties?

48:20.549 --> 48:22.377
Not as gluten-free.

48:24.902 --> 48:30.211
Um, actually I think I'm
starting to prefer this more.

48:32.039 --> 48:35.216
So how does this compare
to your Boston parties?

48:35.260 --> 48:36.609
Which, actually,

48:36.652 --> 48:40.178
I don't think you ever did
tell me why you left.

48:40.221 --> 48:42.180
Back in Boston I had
a bad falling out

48:42.223 --> 48:45.226
with my producing partner there
and I was done with it.

48:45.270 --> 48:47.446
I wanted out from the city,
the backstabbing,

48:47.489 --> 48:49.100
the fast pace,
just all of it,

48:49.143 --> 48:51.624
and so I got in my car
and started driving

48:51.667 --> 48:53.974
and I stopped in Fall Oaks
to get some food

48:54.018 --> 48:58.761
and everyone here was just...
they were just so nice.

48:58.805 --> 48:59.675
Mmmhmm.

48:59.719 --> 49:00.676
Right?

49:00.720 --> 49:02.983
So nice.

49:03.027 --> 49:07.596
And right at that moment that's
what I needed so I stayed.

49:09.033 --> 49:11.992
Well, I'm happy that you did.

49:12.036 --> 49:14.516
Me too.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.691
Rachel?

49:15.735 --> 49:17.041
Excuse me, sorry.

49:17.084 --> 49:18.651
Uh, could I steal you away
for a sec?

49:18.694 --> 49:20.218
Yeah. I'm sorry.

49:20.261 --> 49:21.567
I totally get it.

49:21.610 --> 49:23.917
Everyone has to talk
to the boss.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.788
I'll be right back.

49:26.659 --> 49:28.269
Thanks.

49:39.889 --> 49:41.456
David.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.544
Hey, Rach.

49:42.588 --> 49:44.720
You came.

50:11.747 --> 50:13.749
Oh, you know,
I almost forgot.

50:16.056 --> 50:18.058
Oh, Rach.

50:18.102 --> 50:19.320
You- you didn't have to.

50:19.364 --> 50:21.496
Oh, no, it's-
it's my pleasure.

50:21.540 --> 50:25.065
It's for you, Suzie,
and the kids.

50:25.109 --> 50:29.722
Oh, before I forget,

50:29.765 --> 50:32.290
the kids made you something.

50:32.333 --> 50:34.292
Thank you.

50:37.686 --> 50:42.039
Oh, it's perfect.

50:45.955 --> 50:48.349
So it's been three years
since I've seen you, Rach.

50:49.002 --> 50:51.222
Three years.

50:51.265 --> 50:53.876
Why so long?

50:53.920 --> 50:58.794
I... I've just been busy and,
you know,

50:58.838 --> 51:01.188
wrapped up in all of this.

51:01.232 --> 51:03.669
It's like...
Suzie and the kids

51:03.712 --> 51:07.629
and I don't even exist
in your world.

51:07.673 --> 51:11.590
Sometimes I feel like
I'm being punished.

51:11.633 --> 51:13.374
Punished? For what?

51:13.418 --> 51:16.160
Because I remind you
of mom and dad

51:16.203 --> 51:17.639
and the pain of losing them.

51:17.683 --> 51:20.555
And I know this town
makes you feel like that, too.

51:23.471 --> 51:24.907
I'm- I'm sorry.

51:24.951 --> 51:26.953
You're busy.

51:26.996 --> 51:30.739
Um, you know, you've uh, you've
got a party to get back to

51:30.783 --> 51:36.484
so thank you so much
for the gifts.

51:36.528 --> 51:39.226
Um, and congratulations
on everything.

51:39.270 --> 51:41.837
Thanks.

51:41.881 --> 51:46.059
I think mom and dad
would be really proud of you.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.366
Because I know I am.

52:03.511 --> 52:04.773
Morning, Rachel.

52:04.817 --> 52:06.514
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

52:06.558 --> 52:07.167
It's-

52:07.211 --> 52:08.037
Good morning.

52:08.081 --> 52:08.777
Morning.

52:08.821 --> 52:10.214
Good morning.

52:10.257 --> 52:11.258
We can talk later.

52:11.302 --> 52:12.259
I'll come find you, ok?

52:12.303 --> 52:14.087
Ok, great. Thanks.

52:14.131 --> 52:17.351
Everything is looking
just wonderful.

52:17.395 --> 52:19.614
Yeah, I hope so.

52:19.658 --> 52:21.050
I'm still working
on this opening speech

52:21.094 --> 52:23.879
and I'm having a really
tough time with it.

52:23.923 --> 52:25.707
Why don't you run it
by Jack?

52:25.751 --> 52:27.361
He's the producer.

52:27.405 --> 52:30.016
Hey, you didn't happen to see
him leave last night, did you?

52:30.059 --> 52:31.104
No.

52:31.148 --> 52:32.192
We were just having such
a great time

52:32.236 --> 52:33.324
and then all of a sudden
he was gone.

52:33.367 --> 52:35.021
I just- I don't know
what happened.

52:35.064 --> 52:37.632
There he is. Why don't you
ask him?

52:41.549 --> 52:42.507
All the way across.

52:42.550 --> 52:43.464
I think that would be good.

52:43.508 --> 52:44.509
Probably two right there.

52:44.552 --> 52:45.292
Two right up there.

52:45.336 --> 52:46.206
Hey guys.

52:46.250 --> 52:47.076
Good morning.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.556
Good morning.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.384
You ok?

52:50.428 --> 52:52.343
You left without saying goodbye
last night.

52:52.386 --> 52:55.172
I'm gonna go get another
breakfast burrito.

52:57.870 --> 52:58.740
All good.

52:58.784 --> 53:00.220
I just thought I'd leave early.

53:00.264 --> 53:02.440
Just keep things professional
between us.

53:03.310 --> 53:05.704
Oh. Right.

53:05.747 --> 53:08.097
Yeah. Right.

53:08.141 --> 53:10.012
Professional.

53:13.277 --> 53:16.323
Hey, uh, who was that guy
at your house?

53:16.367 --> 53:17.019
Huh?

53:17.063 --> 53:19.413
With the red hair.

53:19.457 --> 53:22.547
Uh, is that what this is about?

53:22.590 --> 53:23.896
No.

53:23.939 --> 53:25.593
Maybe.

53:27.769 --> 53:29.858
That was my brother, David.

53:31.817 --> 53:33.993
[laughs]

53:34.036 --> 53:35.734
That was your brother,
David.

53:35.777 --> 53:36.735
Mmmhmm.

53:36.778 --> 53:37.779
Oh yeah.

53:37.823 --> 53:39.738
Were you jealous?

53:39.781 --> 53:40.782
No. No.

53:40.826 --> 53:42.349
Maybe.

53:42.393 --> 53:43.785
I'm sorry.

53:43.829 --> 53:45.744
[laughing]

53:45.787 --> 53:51.750
Well, maybe we could finish
that dance sometime.

53:51.793 --> 53:53.273
I'd like that.

53:53.317 --> 53:55.144
Yeah.

53:55.188 --> 53:58.974
Um, but first...

53:59.018 --> 54:01.238
I might need your help
with something.

54:01.281 --> 54:02.978
Sure. What is it?

54:03.022 --> 54:04.980
You ok?

54:05.024 --> 54:09.507
Yeah, it's just been a long
time since I've been in there.

54:09.550 --> 54:11.422
Oh yeah, this is the house
you grew up in.

54:11.465 --> 54:14.686
Yeah.

54:14.729 --> 54:18.124
I don't know if I can
do this.

54:18.167 --> 54:20.822
Well, I'm here to make sure
you can.

54:20.866 --> 54:22.911
Thank you.

54:25.697 --> 54:27.481
[doorbell rings]

54:30.832 --> 54:32.704
Hey.

54:32.747 --> 54:34.706
Hey.

54:37.056 --> 54:38.492
Suzie said you might
be stopping by.

54:38.536 --> 54:40.189
Yeah.

54:40.233 --> 54:43.105
Oh, this is uh, my uh,
my producer.

54:43.149 --> 54:44.106
Hi. Jack.

54:44.150 --> 54:44.846
Hi.

54:44.890 --> 54:45.673
Nice to meet you.

54:45.717 --> 54:47.327
Nice to meet you.

54:47.371 --> 54:48.197
Well, come on in.

54:48.241 --> 54:49.329
Great.

54:49.373 --> 54:51.026
Because we are making
the world famous

54:51.070 --> 54:53.159
Kennedy Christmas popcorn balls.

54:53.202 --> 54:54.465
Stop it.

54:54.508 --> 54:55.466
You're still keeping up
with mom's tradition?

54:55.509 --> 54:56.989
Every year.

54:57.032 --> 54:59.513
Actually, it is a Kennedy
circus in there.

54:59.557 --> 55:01.298
Rachel, it is so good
to see you.

55:01.341 --> 55:03.082
So good to see you.

55:04.213 --> 55:05.780
Hi. I'm Suzie.

55:05.824 --> 55:06.520
Hi. Jack.

55:06.564 --> 55:08.174
Nice to meet you.

55:08.217 --> 55:11.699
Oh, I um... I wanted
to personally invite you

55:11.743 --> 55:13.266
to the event.

55:13.310 --> 55:14.876
It wouldn't be the same
without having

55:14.920 --> 55:17.314
you and the kids there.

55:17.357 --> 55:18.793
Thank you.

55:18.837 --> 55:20.317
Yeah.

55:20.360 --> 55:26.366
And also I'm sorry for not
stopping by earlier and um,

55:26.410 --> 55:30.588
for not being there for you
and the kids.

55:30.631 --> 55:34.809
I know that it doesn't fix
things but I would really like

55:34.853 --> 55:38.160
to be a part of
the family again.

55:39.901 --> 55:44.210
Yeah. Yeah.

55:44.253 --> 55:46.255
Well, you guys wanna
hang out for a bit?

55:46.299 --> 55:47.561
Yea- yeah.

55:47.605 --> 55:48.867
Yes, we would love it
if you all could stay.

55:48.910 --> 55:49.737
Absolutely.

55:49.781 --> 55:51.260
Great. Putting you to work.

55:51.304 --> 55:52.261
We can be put to work.

55:52.305 --> 55:53.088
Ok, let's go.

55:53.132 --> 55:53.872
Come on.

55:53.915 --> 55:54.568
Ok.

55:54.612 --> 55:55.221
I'll take your coat.

55:55.264 --> 55:56.048
Ok, thanks.

55:56.091 --> 55:57.571
Look who's here!

55:57.615 --> 55:58.398
Auntie!

55:58.442 --> 55:59.834
Hi!

55:59.878 --> 56:01.880
[squealing]

56:01.923 --> 56:03.142
Oh my god,
you're so big!

56:03.185 --> 56:13.195
â™ª

56:13.239 --> 56:19.550
â™ª

56:20.072 --> 56:21.552
It was a great day.

56:21.595 --> 56:22.553
They're good people.

56:22.596 --> 56:23.771
Yeah.

56:23.815 --> 56:25.338
By the way, I have thought
about your idea

56:25.382 --> 56:28.341
and I think you're right.

56:28.385 --> 56:31.779
We should call it the Christmas
Inspiration Celebration.

56:31.823 --> 56:32.563
Really?

56:32.606 --> 56:33.607
Yeah, really.

56:33.651 --> 56:35.479
Wow. Ok.

56:38.830 --> 56:40.135
So I should probably go.

56:40.179 --> 56:42.224
Stuart's waiting for me.

56:42.268 --> 56:43.443
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:43.487 --> 56:44.183
Sure.

56:44.226 --> 56:44.923
Ok.

56:44.966 --> 56:45.880
I'll see you tomorrow.

56:45.924 --> 56:46.881
Yeah.

56:46.925 --> 56:48.448
Three days 'til the big show.

56:48.492 --> 56:50.450
Don't stress,
it's in good shape.

56:50.494 --> 56:52.713
Fingers crossed.

56:57.588 --> 56:58.676
[knocking]

56:58.719 --> 57:00.286
Hey.

57:00.329 --> 57:01.722
Where were you?

57:01.766 --> 57:05.378
I was with my family
and Jack.

57:05.422 --> 57:08.120
You seem to be spending
a lot of time with Jack.

57:08.163 --> 57:10.035
And with Joy.

57:10.078 --> 57:12.124
I didn't know that was
a problem.

57:12.167 --> 57:15.388
Well, we do have a problem.

57:15.432 --> 57:18.435
I hate to be the bearer of bad
news but your friend Joy

57:18.478 --> 57:21.394
has a background we should
be concerned about.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.048
If that gets into
the wrong hands

57:23.091 --> 57:25.485
it could be some very
bad press for us.

57:27.313 --> 57:28.445
Joy has an arrest record?

57:28.488 --> 57:30.490
Mmmhmm.

57:30.534 --> 57:32.187
Where did you get this?

57:32.231 --> 57:34.146
Does it matter?

57:34.189 --> 57:38.106
Rachel, my first priority
is to protect you.

57:38.150 --> 57:40.500
You do understand that,
don't you?

57:43.024 --> 57:45.374
Good.

57:45.418 --> 57:47.464
So what're we gonna
do about this?

57:54.558 --> 57:55.689
I'm thinking if we drop snow

57:55.733 --> 57:56.908
over the front of
the audience first

57:56.951 --> 57:58.387
and then we can do it again
in the back.

57:58.431 --> 58:00.520
I think that would be the best
if we could um,

58:00.564 --> 58:01.739
kinda tease that out
a little bit.

58:01.782 --> 58:05.830
What do you think?

58:05.873 --> 58:07.571
Ok, and then we can have
Santa come over

58:07.614 --> 58:08.659
and land on your head here.

58:08.702 --> 58:09.834
We could bring some
reindeer in-

58:09.877 --> 58:10.704
Wait. What?

58:10.748 --> 58:12.837
What?

58:12.880 --> 58:15.317
I'm just making sure
you're paying attention.

58:15.361 --> 58:16.231
Are you ok?

58:16.275 --> 58:17.450
[sighs]

58:17.494 --> 58:20.540
Stuart showed me something
and it's just...

58:20.584 --> 58:22.890
been upsetting me all morning.

58:22.934 --> 58:25.719
What did he show you?

58:25.763 --> 58:28.722
Um, something about Joy.

58:28.766 --> 58:30.637
She did something.

58:30.681 --> 58:33.248
What did she do?

58:33.292 --> 58:35.337
I guess she stole some money.

58:35.381 --> 58:37.339
It was a long time ago.

58:44.608 --> 58:46.392
Do you know why she did it?

58:46.435 --> 58:47.219
No.

58:47.262 --> 58:49.482
I don't- I mean,

58:49.526 --> 58:52.659
I just can't have the press get
a hold of this.

58:52.703 --> 58:55.619
I mean, you know how they
can embellish everything

58:55.662 --> 59:00.014
and we just can't afford to have
bad press with the event

59:00.058 --> 59:02.234
and the book release
in a few days.

59:02.277 --> 59:04.628
Who cares what
the press thinks?

59:04.671 --> 59:07.892
Just think about Joy and
what she's done for you,

59:07.935 --> 59:10.285
and who she is now.

59:10.329 --> 59:11.852
I know.

59:11.896 --> 59:13.941
I know. I- you're right,

59:13.985 --> 59:17.205
I'm... just, with
all this pressure

59:17.249 --> 59:18.467
I just haven't been
thinking clearly.

59:18.511 --> 59:19.599
Listen to me.

59:19.643 --> 59:20.687
Don't worry about this event.

59:20.731 --> 59:22.210
It's gonna be spectacular.

59:22.254 --> 59:23.864
You think?

59:23.908 --> 59:26.563
If it comes from your heart
how can you go wrong?

59:34.353 --> 59:36.529
[knocking]

59:56.636 --> 59:57.942
Hi, Joy.

59:57.985 --> 59:59.726
Come on in.

59:59.770 --> 01:00:02.947
Thanks for coming by.

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:05.776
I brought you this.

01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:08.430
I thought it might give you
a little inspiration

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:10.868
for your event.

01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:14.175
The stories in here have always
been so precious to me

01:00:14.219 --> 01:00:15.568
my whole life.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:20.791
I do love the message
in that book.

01:00:20.834 --> 01:00:26.535
I feel uncomfortable, um,
bringing this up, but...

01:00:31.889 --> 01:00:34.152
Where'd you get that?

01:00:34.195 --> 01:00:36.850
Stuart brought it
to my attention.

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:38.286
Stuart.

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:42.508
And look, I'm not trying
to point any fingers, but,

01:00:42.551 --> 01:00:43.988
you know, if the press
gets a hold of this

01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:45.816
they're always looking
for a good story,

01:00:45.859 --> 01:00:47.687
especially when it comes to-

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:49.167
Your reputation.

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.430
I understand.

01:00:51.473 --> 01:00:55.477
I understand, too, that we
all do things that we regret.

01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:57.305
Yes, we do.

01:01:01.745 --> 01:01:03.572
I had a son.

01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:12.146
I met his father when he was
a conductor at the philharmonic.

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:16.368
I was very young.

01:01:16.411 --> 01:01:19.153
I thought it was love.

01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:22.548
When he found out I was pregnant

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:27.205
I found out it wasn't.

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:28.989
I was forced to leave
the orchestra.

01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:34.125
I took a job at a department
store, part-time.

01:01:34.168 --> 01:01:38.520
But when the baby came
it wasn't enough.

01:01:38.564 --> 01:01:40.784
I couldn't get by.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:47.704
I took some money
from the cash register.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:55.189
I was caught and arrested.

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:59.933
I wanted so much more for my son
than I could ever provide.

01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:01.761
There was this couple,

01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:05.025
wealthy donors
to the symphony,

01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:07.332
who were looking
to adopt at the time

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:11.553
and I knew they could give him
a so much better life

01:02:11.597 --> 01:02:14.643
than I ever could.

01:02:14.687 --> 01:02:19.474
I gave up the only family
I would ever have.

01:02:19.518 --> 01:02:23.522
I've lived with that every day
of my life.

01:02:23.565 --> 01:02:28.440
I wouldn't wish that loneliness
on anyone.

01:02:28.483 --> 01:02:31.008
When I finally got back
on my feet

01:02:31.051 --> 01:02:34.185
I made a promise that I would do
everything in my power

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:37.579
to help anyone
who ever needed help.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.759
So here.

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:51.550
Life is messy, Rachel.

01:02:53.247 --> 01:02:55.946
But sometimes, if we get
through the mess,

01:02:55.989 --> 01:02:59.645
we find out who we really are.

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:02.387
I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:03:07.566 --> 01:03:09.437
[sighs]

01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:22.494
That one.

01:03:22.537 --> 01:03:23.495
That one sounds a little low,
doesn't it?

01:03:23.538 --> 01:03:25.802
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:27.107
No worries.

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:28.413
We're just wrapping up
a few sound things here,

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:29.718
make sure we're all locked in
for tomorrow.

01:03:29.762 --> 01:03:30.981
Ok, great.

01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:33.157
Oh, that's one of my favourites.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.158
Yeah?

01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:36.334
Joy gave me this
for inspiration.

01:03:36.377 --> 01:03:37.944
She gave you what
for inspiration?

01:03:37.988 --> 01:03:39.467
The uh, The Apple Garden.

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:40.555
I love that book.

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:41.556
So good, right?

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.949
Oh, no, no, no.

01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:44.733
That book has been traumatizing
kids for decades.

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:46.387
I beg to differ.

01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:47.911
Do you?

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:49.608
Ok, Scrooge.

01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:52.567
Did you have that chat
with Joy yet?

01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:54.569
Yes, I did, and I hate myself
for even bringing it up.

01:03:54.613 --> 01:03:57.137
I've now made a huge mess.

01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:59.009
Oh, well, maybe go fix it.

01:03:59.052 --> 01:04:00.227
No, no, no time for fixing.

01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:02.447
We have the event
in less than 24 hours.

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.709
We have to do run-throughs.

01:04:03.752 --> 01:04:05.493
Bridget?

01:04:08.888 --> 01:04:10.498
Look, there's plenty of time.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:12.109
We have all the time in
the world for run-throughs.

01:04:12.152 --> 01:04:14.285
Some things are more important
than work.

01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:15.982
Yeah, you're right.

01:04:16.026 --> 01:04:17.984
Ok, I'm gonna do it.

01:04:18.028 --> 01:04:19.507
She's at the community centre.
I'll be right back.

01:04:19.551 --> 01:04:21.074
Ok.

01:04:31.998 --> 01:04:33.652
Wow.

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:55.500
[playing piano]
â™ª

01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:58.459
[clapping]

01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:01.375
I'm so sorry for bringing up
your past like I did.

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:03.421
I should never have
done that.

01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:06.815
You have been nothing
but kind and open to me.

01:05:06.859 --> 01:05:12.343
The last thing I would want
would be to cause you trouble.

01:05:12.386 --> 01:05:13.997
No.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:17.000
No, you have never
caused me trouble.

01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:22.092
I only see you as
who you are today.

01:05:22.135 --> 01:05:27.662
Please, can we just
put this behind us?

01:05:30.056 --> 01:05:32.015
Thank you.

01:05:39.457 --> 01:05:40.762
Hey.

01:05:40.806 --> 01:05:42.068
What is it?

01:05:42.112 --> 01:05:43.809
How is this photo in the book
Joy gave you?

01:05:43.852 --> 01:05:45.376
This is the exact same photo
that my parents

01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:47.813
had on our mantle.

01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:49.858
This is me.

01:05:52.861 --> 01:05:54.559
What?

01:05:59.216 --> 01:06:02.088
Is Joy...

01:06:02.132 --> 01:06:05.091
is she my mother?

01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:07.572
I- I don't know.

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:09.139
Did you know about any-
did she know-

01:06:09.182 --> 01:06:10.705
No!

01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:14.883
All I know is that I- I just
found out that she had a son

01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:19.366
and she gave him up for adoption
a long time ago.

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:23.414
The photo that you're holding
in your hand must be of him.

01:06:23.457 --> 01:06:27.026
Or, I don't know,
I guess of... you.

01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:34.338
What do I say to her?

01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:36.993
It's just like you told me.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:39.212
If it's coming from
your heart then how

01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:41.910
can you possibly go wrong?

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:58.057
Something hit me
when I first saw you.

01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:02.540
I just didn't know
what it was.

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:07.066
I looked all over
for that picture.

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:09.677
I thought I had lost it.

01:07:09.721 --> 01:07:12.506
Where was it?
Where'd you find it?

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:16.162
The Apple Garden.

01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:18.512
It was in the copy
you gave to Rachel.

01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:20.340
Right.

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:28.435
I cannot tell you how often
I looked at that picture.

01:07:28.479 --> 01:07:31.351
Over and over and over.

01:07:31.395 --> 01:07:35.138
It was all I had.

01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:39.185
I was not allowed to have
any contact with you.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.544
Do I have brothers
and sisters?

01:07:52.894 --> 01:07:54.461
No.

01:07:56.507 --> 01:08:00.467
I had only one child.

01:08:00.511 --> 01:08:05.777
A beautiful baby boy.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:14.742
I've held you, in here,
for 35 years.

01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:19.312
I've made up all these- these
stories in my mind about...

01:08:19.356 --> 01:08:20.921
about why you would
give me up for adoption.

01:08:20.966 --> 01:08:22.010
Was I not good enough?

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:23.055
Was I not-

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.839
You were perfect.

01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:27.059
You were perfect.

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:32.673
I was so young and so...

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.858
alone,

01:08:43.902 --> 01:08:49.647
and so unable to give you
the kind of life that I...

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:53.651
I wanted you to have.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:55.913
Did you have
a good life?

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:58.264
Have you had a good life?

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.573
Yeah.

01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:12.017
It's been pretty good.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.411
Pretty good.

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.763
I'm sorry, this is all-

01:09:18.805 --> 01:09:21.243
it's just a little too much
for me to-

01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:22.636
for me to soak in right now.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.944
I just... I just need to take
a little time and-

01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:30.122
and let it all sink in,
I think, if that's...

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:30.904
Of course.

01:09:30.948 --> 01:09:31.993
If that's ok with you.

01:09:32.037 --> 01:09:33.343
Of course.

01:09:33.386 --> 01:09:35.823
Take- take all the time
you need.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:48.227
Ten percent gain on-
that one there?

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:50.185
Yeah, I think so.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:57.976
Hey.

01:09:58.019 --> 01:09:59.151
Joy.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.675
I was looking for the piano.

01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:03.024
I need to clear my head.

01:10:03.068 --> 01:10:04.330
Would it be ok if I play?

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:05.636
Perfect timing.

01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:06.941
We're just about to sound
check it, anyways.

01:10:06.985 --> 01:10:08.334
Please. Please.

01:10:08.378 --> 01:10:10.206
Be my guest.

01:10:14.993 --> 01:10:18.605
So are you still heading back
to LA right after the event?

01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:20.128
I tried to get here
on time but...

01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:22.870
Hey, that's not a problem.

01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:24.698
You ok?

01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:29.268
I think I'm in a much better
place now, yeah.

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:30.487
Thanks.

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.490
Thank you for...
for being there.

01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:36.144
â™ª

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:37.972
That can't be.
Is that-

01:10:38.016 --> 01:10:39.235
It's Joy on the piano.

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:42.673
No, the... the song.
"Christmas Memories."

01:10:42.716 --> 01:10:44.631
That... the piano,
that's the same exact one

01:10:44.675 --> 01:10:49.114
from the tape I told you about
when I was younger.

01:10:49.157 --> 01:10:59.167
[piano playing]
â™ª

01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:09.221
[piano playing]
â™ª

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:19.187
[piano playing]
â™ª

01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:29.241
[piano playing]
â™ª

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:39.207

â™ª

[piano playing]
â™ª

[piano playing]
â™ª

01:11:55.789 --> 01:11:58.749
â™ª There's a blanket of snow, â™ª

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:02.230
â™ª Covering up the old road, â™ª

01:12:02.274 --> 01:12:07.714
â™ª To the house where
I was raised, â™ª

01:12:07.758 --> 01:12:11.196
â™ª Through the window
I see, â™ª

01:12:11.239 --> 01:12:14.155
â™ª The lights on the tree, â™ª

01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:19.813
â™ª And a glow from
the old fireplace, â™ª

01:12:19.857 --> 01:12:23.295
â™ª Though it all looks
the same, â™ª

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.689
â™ª So much has changed, â™ª

01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:31.259
â™ª From the way
it used to be, â™ª

01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:35.220
â™ª Christmas memories, â™ª

01:12:35.263 --> 01:12:40.138
â™ª Of happy years gone by, â™ª

01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:43.924
â™ª They come back to me, â™ª

01:12:43.968 --> 01:12:48.712
â™ª And keep me warm inside, â™ª

01:12:48.755 --> 01:12:55.153
â™ª Still those
Christmas memories, â™ª

01:12:55.196 --> 01:13:00.767
â™ª Oh they mean so much
to me, â™ª

01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:08.645
â™ª Oh those Christmas
memories, â™ª

01:13:08.688 --> 01:13:10.211
â™ª Make me cry â™ª

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:20.221
â™ª

01:13:20.265 --> 01:13:26.010
â™ª

01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:33.800
That's a good one.

01:13:33.844 --> 01:13:34.497
You think so?

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.236
We should-

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:35.889
that actually happened.

01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:36.760
We can use that.

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:37.587
Oh no.

01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:38.283
No, no, no.

01:13:38.326 --> 01:13:39.632
Are you tired?

01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:40.590
Uh, no.

01:13:40.633 --> 01:13:42.461
Maybe just a little.

01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:43.593
[laughs]

01:13:43.636 --> 01:13:44.724
Oh. I'm gonna go score
some candy canes

01:13:44.768 --> 01:13:47.118
to boost our blood sugar.

01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:47.945
Yes. Ok.

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:49.468
Hey.

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:52.863
Um... thank you.

01:13:52.906 --> 01:13:54.168
You know that I could
never have done

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:56.214
any of this without you.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:01.915
I couldn't have made it through
the last 12 hours without you.

01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.574
Ok.

01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:31.989
[Austin]: Are we all ready
for tomorrow?

01:14:32.032 --> 01:14:33.947
[Stuart]: Yes, and you won't
be disappointed.

01:14:33.991 --> 01:14:35.775
[Austin]: Good.

01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:37.951
[Stuart]: I just sent you a
video I took with my phone.

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:40.301
It's footage of Rachel
volunteering

01:14:40.345 --> 01:14:42.826
at the Fall Oaks
community centre.

01:14:42.869 --> 01:14:45.263
How's that for a home grown
Christmas story?

01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:47.395
Of course, Rachel did this
to strengthen her brand,

01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:50.616
for us, and for you,
the publishers.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.531
Are you sure Rachel's
in line with this?

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:56.013
Of course she is. It's been
her plan all along.

01:14:56.056 --> 01:14:57.928
Did you run this by
her events producer?

01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:00.539
After tomorrow Jack
will no longer be needed.

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:03.063
Rachel will be back on the first flight to Los Angeles.

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.804
She will have forgotten
all about him.

01:15:04.848 --> 01:15:07.024
This is business, Austin.

01:15:07.067 --> 01:15:10.375
Business always
comes first with Rachel.

01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:11.245
Yes.

01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:18.165
What's wrong?
Where are you going?

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:19.558
I trusted you with so much.

01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:21.473
You know how hard
that is for me?

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:22.561
What're you-

01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:23.954
what?

01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:27.044
How much would you exploit
for a book sale, huh?

01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:29.089
You were just using the people
of this, using me,

01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:30.351
to get a better book deal?

01:15:30.395 --> 01:15:31.657
What're you talking about?

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:32.571
Oh, you don't know?

01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:34.094
How about you go ask Stuart?

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:35.400
I just heard him explaining
the whole thing to Austin.

01:15:35.443 --> 01:15:38.838
I can't believe I let
my guard down with you.

01:15:38.882 --> 01:15:41.275
Wait... Jack?

01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:49.719
I finally let myself get close
to someone.

01:15:49.762 --> 01:15:53.766
Now he wants nothing
to do with me.

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:59.424
Well, he's going through
a lot right now.

01:15:59.467 --> 01:16:01.557
He's scared.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.082
Just like you.

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:08.781
It means you care
about each other.

01:16:08.825 --> 01:16:12.959
Every day is a second chance.

01:16:13.003 --> 01:16:16.397
We have, what, 12 hours
'til the event?

01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:22.273
What're you doing?

01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:25.798
I am making things ok.

01:16:25.842 --> 01:16:28.409
With a little Christmas magic.

01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:36.635
Merry Christmas.

01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:38.245
Merry Christmas.

01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:45.035
[laughs]

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.084
Hi, David.

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:52.216
Hi, Suzie.

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:53.217
I'm Bridget.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.131
Let me show you
to your seats.

01:16:54.174 --> 01:16:55.828
Great.

01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:04.968
All the new changes are set.

01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:06.752
I cannot thank you enough,
Paul.

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:07.797
Is Jack here?

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.363
Oh, not yet.

01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:10.669
I gotta get back to the booth.

01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:11.627
Have a good show.

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:13.106
Thanks.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.893
Ok.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:20.940
Rachel, what's going on?

01:17:20.984 --> 01:17:23.595
I've been trying to call you.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:26.032
What did you and Austin
talk about last night?

01:17:26.076 --> 01:17:30.515
Um... I- I sent him
a promo package

01:17:30.558 --> 01:17:32.430
showing how generous
you'd been in the community.

01:17:32.473 --> 01:17:34.475
I never asked you
to do any of that.

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:38.131
Good to go?

01:17:38.175 --> 01:17:39.829
Yeah. Your headphones
are right there, bud.

01:17:43.484 --> 01:17:45.835
Is that what you were filming
from your phone, Stuart?

01:17:45.878 --> 01:17:48.707
Oh, sorry, that's uh...
just checking on Rachel's-

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:50.535
No, no, no. Don't turn it off.

01:17:50.578 --> 01:17:52.189
Leave it on, please.

01:17:52.232 --> 01:17:53.451
Yeah, I wanted to make sure
that you got credit

01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:54.757
for all the charitable works
you've been doing.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.411
Isn't that what this has
been all about?

01:17:57.455 --> 01:17:59.457
Is that what you think?

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.590
And what did you say
about Jack?

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:04.288
Nothing.

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:05.811
Look, I think you should
concentrate on what-

01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:06.899
No, Stuart.

01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:08.553
I want you to answer me.

01:18:08.596 --> 01:18:10.816
What did you say about Jack?

01:18:12.775 --> 01:18:14.733
I may have said that
after this event

01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:17.040
we won't need him anymore.

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:20.652
Because he's been a distraction
and frankly so is Joy.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.046
What does it say in chapter
13 in your book?

01:18:23.089 --> 01:18:24.700
Distractions mean disaster.

01:18:24.743 --> 01:18:26.353
I trusted you.

01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:28.573
As my friend.

01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:31.402
But I was wrong.

01:18:31.445 --> 01:18:32.751
I was wrong
about a lot of things.

01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:34.448
Rachel, I have always
had your back.

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:39.192
Yeah, only when
it benefits you.

01:18:39.236 --> 01:18:41.194
I used to be the same way.

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:48.680
I think that it's best if we go
our separate ways for a while.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.117
Have a safe flight back
to LA.

01:19:04.348 --> 01:19:06.306
[crowd murmurs]

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:09.832
Okay, here we go, shh!

01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:18.144
â™ª Silent night, â™ª

01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:22.845
â™ª Holy night, â™ª

01:19:22.888 --> 01:19:27.719
â™ª All is calm, â™ª

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:33.464
â™ª All is bright â™ª

01:19:33.507 --> 01:19:35.379
Hello everyone.

01:19:35.422 --> 01:19:37.076
I'm Rachel Kennedy!

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:45.258
[applause]

01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:47.217
Two weeks ago
I asked you

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.436
to look at yourselves
in the mirror.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.788
I said in order to be happy

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:55.312
you have to make yourself
happy first.

01:19:55.355 --> 01:20:00.317
But tonight I would like you to
do something different for me.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.840
Look around.

01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:06.062
Look at the faces on your right and on your left.

01:20:06.105 --> 01:20:08.194
Those faces.

01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:11.676
Maybe it's time we started
putting them first.

01:20:11.719 --> 01:20:15.419
At Christmas, and throughout
the entire year,

01:20:15.462 --> 01:20:18.509
we all need a little help.

01:20:18.552 --> 01:20:23.209
We all need to be reminded
that we are not alone.

01:20:23.253 --> 01:20:27.692
[applause]

01:20:27.735 --> 01:20:32.958
It took a little Joy

01:20:36.135 --> 01:20:39.617
and a Jack of all trades

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:44.187
to show me the true spirit
of Christmas.

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:48.060
But I think that we should
all be living

01:20:48.104 --> 01:20:52.586
the true spirit of Christmas
all year 'round.

01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:57.548
And Christmas spirit
is about giving.

01:20:57.591 --> 01:21:00.768
Because someone once
reminded me

01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:04.860
that inspiration should never
be expensive,

01:21:04.903 --> 01:21:07.514
so all proceeds from
tonight's event,

01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:10.300
and a portion of book sales
will go directly

01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:12.780
to the Fall Oaks
Community Centre.

01:21:12.824 --> 01:21:20.658
[cheering and applause]

01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:25.445
But finally,
most important,

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:30.320
Christmas spirit is about love.

01:21:30.363 --> 01:21:34.019
[applause]

01:21:36.456 --> 01:21:40.983
â™ª

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:43.159
â™ª Joy to the world, â™ª

01:21:43.202 --> 01:21:45.683
â™ª The Lord is come, â™ª

01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:48.991
â™ª Let earth receive her king, â™ª

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:50.340
I like what I hear.

01:21:50.383 --> 01:21:53.038
You got yourself
another book deal.

01:21:53.082 --> 01:21:57.913
Thank you so much.

01:21:57.956 --> 01:21:58.914
Congrats.

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.524
Thank you.

01:22:00.567 --> 01:22:02.961
I heard everything
you said to Stuart.

01:22:03.005 --> 01:22:04.484
I'm so sorry.

01:22:04.528 --> 01:22:09.185
Hey. Christmas spirit
is about forgiveness.

01:22:23.764 --> 01:22:26.376
Get back out there.

01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:35.951
â™ª ...Heaven and nature sing â™ª

01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:38.344
[applause]

01:22:38.388 --> 01:22:42.348
Now who is ready to make this
the best Christmas ever?

01:22:42.392 --> 01:22:48.572
[applause]

01:23:01.672 --> 01:23:05.110
â™ª Angels we have heard
on high, â™ª

01:23:05.154 --> 01:23:09.767
â™ª Sweetly singing o'er
the plains, â™ª

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:14.902
â™ª And the mountains in reply, â™ª

01:23:14.946 --> 01:23:18.906
â™ª Echoing their joyous
strains, â™ª

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:27.915
â™ª Gloria, â™ª

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:32.311
â™ª in excelsis Deo, â™ª

01:23:32.355 --> 01:23:41.146
â™ª Gloria, â™ª

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:48.762
â™ª
