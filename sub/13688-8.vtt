Question one:

17:35.287 --> 17:36.722
has Cameron told you

17:36.789 --> 17:40.692
he loves
both Alexis and Ariana?

17:40.759 --> 17:41.927
{\an3}- Yes.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.429
- Do Cameron and Ariana

17:43.495 --> 17:45.931
sleep in the same bed?

17:45.998 --> 17:47.966
{\an8}- Yes.
- See?

17:48.033 --> 17:51.336
{\an9}Cameron has dug himself
so deep in a hole,

17:51.403 --> 17:53.338
{\an9}he doesn't even know
what's happening anymore.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.307
{\an8}- Yeah.
- He has said so much [bleep]

17:55.374 --> 17:57.342
{\an8}to so many people,

17:57.409 --> 17:58.510
{\an9}he doesn't even remember which
truth

17:58.577 --> 17:59.711
{\an8}he's supposed to say...
- Yeah.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.814
{\an8}- Because they're all lies.
- Yeah.

18:01.880 --> 18:06.819
{\an1}- Do Cameron and Ariana shower
together regularly?

18:07.052 --> 18:10.556
{\an3}- Yes.

18:10.622 --> 18:11.824
all: Oh!

18:11.890 --> 18:14.927
{\an8}- I definitely don't shower
with my friends.

18:14.993 --> 18:18.330
{\an8}But I'm sure Cameron and Ariana
take innocent showers.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.431
{\an8}You know, you need
to save water.

18:19.498 --> 18:20.966
{\an8}I understand.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.901
- Has Cameron ever told you

18:22.968 --> 18:25.204
that Ariana is the girl

18:25.270 --> 18:26.839
{\an8}he is going to marry?

18:26.905 --> 18:31.343
- Yes, without a doubt.
- Hand to Geles.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.846
<i>- Alexis, do you have</i>
<i>any questions</i>

18:33.912 --> 18:35.547

18:35.614 --> 18:36.949
- I know you guys
don't think this,

18:37.015 --> 18:39.084
but Cameron is
pretty honest with me.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.353
- Oh, God.
- This is painful.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.155
<i>- Oh, Alexis.</i>

18:43.222 --> 18:44.857
{\an8}Come on, sis.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.895
{\an8}It's very, very clear

18:49.962 --> 18:53.599
{\an8}that you have been content
with being a sideline bitch.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.734
{\an8}- So then why is Alexis
okay with that?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.069
{\an8}- I know.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.537
{\an8}<i>- In order to get someone</i>

18:58.604 --> 19:00.405
{\an8}you need somebody

19:00.472 --> 19:02.107
{\an8}Alexis ain't pressing
no goddamn charges.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.675
{\an8}Why the hell we in court?

19:03.742 --> 19:05.677

is showering thing,

19:05.744 --> 19:07.412

19:07.479 --> 19:09.448
{\an3}it has happened,
but it's not a frequent thing.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.783
{\an3}You're saying it's
an every night kind of thing.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.986
{\an3}I just don't know
how frequent is frequent.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.854
<i>- Cameron's showing you</i>
<i>who he is.</i>

19:15.921 --> 19:17.155
{\an8}He's a little boy to me.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.458
{\an8}<i>And Alexis was not ready</i>
<i>for a man yet,</i>

19:19.525 --> 19:22.327
{\an8}but Alexis needs to leave
Cameron and work on herself.

19:22.394 --> 19:25.297
- Jocelyn please define
shower frequency.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.833
- Frequent is enough that he's
in the shower with her.

19:27.900 --> 19:31.436
- Yeah. What the [bleep]?
- Like six out of seven nights.

19:31.503 --> 19:35.340

- I'm a fan of Jocelyn.

19:35.407 --> 19:36.842

- Like, you're making it seem
like we shower together

19:38.377 --> 19:39.511
every [bleep] night,
and that's not the case.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.113
- Yes, it is the case.

19:41.179 --> 19:43.448
- It's not every single night,
but it is most of the nights.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.716
- It's most nights.
- I'm telling you,

19:44.783 --> 19:45.884
I've already explained
to her why.

19:45.951 --> 19:46.852
{\an3}- So then you can live
with Alexis

19:46.919 --> 19:47.886
and she can take care of you.

19:47.953 --> 19:51.723
{\an8}- Oh, yeah.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.035
{\an8}the more that he talks
in these certain circles

20:03.101 --> 20:06.071
{\an8}and changes the way he speaks
to different people--

20:06.138 --> 20:07.673
{\an8}he is very manipulative.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.808
- The witness is now excused.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.978
{\an3}- By the way, she does
pay your rent.

20:15.747 --> 20:19.718

20:19.785 --> 20:20.886

your own bills.

20:22.521 --> 20:26.224
{\an8}So not only are you a cheater,
you're broke.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.760
{\an8}- Court is now adjourned.

20:28.827 --> 20:32.864

{\an3}juggling both of your exes

36:30.388 --> 36:31.989
- It's kind of hard.
I'm not gonna lie.

36:32.056 --> 36:33.591
It's just
a hard situation to be in.

36:33.658 --> 36:35.626
Yesterday
at the Shack of Secrets,

36:35.693 --> 36:37.128
a lot of stuff
came up about Ariana.

36:38.462 --> 36:39.764
{\an8}- So we got back to the house.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.399
{\an8}They gave their opinions
like they always do.

36:41.465 --> 36:43.534
I tried to argue it out.

36:43.601 --> 36:46.704
But I think, as Kenya said,
just because you tell the truth

36:46.771 --> 36:47.905
doesn't mean
that it makes it right.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.774
- How do y'all feel though?

36:49.840 --> 36:52.510
{\an3}'Cause I'm hearing Cam
do all the talking.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.445
- For me, it's difficult,
because...

36:54.512 --> 36:55.813
whenever I say something

36:55.880 --> 36:57.748
in a way to defend Cam,

36:57.815 --> 36:59.750
{\an1}then I'm seen
as stupid or naive,

36:59.817 --> 37:01.252
{\an1}and I don't want
to come off that way.

37:01.319 --> 37:02.954
Cam and I have talked
everything out,

37:03.020 --> 37:05.356
and we wanted to give
each other a fair shot,

37:05.423 --> 37:08.659
{\an1}and it sucks that other people
can say it, but I can't.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.495
- What do you have
to say about that?

37:11.562 --> 37:14.098
- When you put in ten years
and you get nothing,

37:14.165 --> 37:15.866
you kind of have
to start looking at something

37:15.933 --> 37:18.869
and realizing the problem
isn't you, it's somebody else.

37:18.936 --> 37:21.105
{\an3}- Cameron is
a great manipulator.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.007
So the girls are just--
I don't know.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.775
{\an8}They're kind of sprung.

37:24.842 --> 37:26.611

37:26.677 --> 37:27.712
{\an1}I'm sorry,

37:27.778 --> 37:29.780
because I do feel

37:29.847 --> 37:31.215
{\an1}like there
is a good man in you,

37:31.282 --> 37:34.385
{\an1}and I have seen things
about you that are charming,

37:34.452 --> 37:37.188
but you're a boy
that doesn't know himself.

37:37.254 --> 37:42.193
And you are reactive,
emotionally unintelligent.

37:42.259 --> 37:45.763
You're lying and you can't
just be honest about any of it.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.331
Something is wrong.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.010
{\an1}- You're lying and you can't
just be honest about any of it.

37:59.076 --> 38:01.412

[bleep] crying every day.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.118
and I don't believe it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:07.184 --> 38:09.253
- Cameron thinks everybody else
is just against him.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.721
[hiccups]
- Yeah.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.189
<i>- At this point, I'm just--</i>
<i>I'm just feeling</i>

38:12.256 --> 38:13.924

{\an3}If this ends up

38:24.068 --> 38:26.370
{\an3}what are your final words

38:26.437 --> 38:28.906

already.

38:29.507 --> 38:31.475
It's between him and I.
- Ariana.

{\an3}You're my best friend,
