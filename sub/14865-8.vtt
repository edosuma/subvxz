WEBVTT

01:43.229 --> 01:46.312
In the dawn of our history,

01:46.440 --> 01:50.149
we men of Rome were strong and fierce

01:50.278 --> 01:54.442
but also uncouth and solitary creatures.

01:54.573 --> 01:57.610
It was only when we acquired wives

01:57.743 --> 02:00.780
that our rise to greatness truly began.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.245
It is the women of Rome

02:03.374 --> 02:07.834
with their steely virtue and chaste morals

02:07.962 --> 02:10.044
who have conquered the world.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.084
It is by their virtuous light

02:16.220 --> 02:19.804
that we men have trod
the perilous paths of glory.

02:23.853 --> 02:26.469
It is the women of Rome

02:26.605 --> 02:28.470
who guarded hearth and home

02:28.607 --> 02:31.849
while we men burnt Carthage.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.396
It is the women of Rome,

02:33.529 --> 02:37.397
like the she—wolf that suckled
Romulus and Remus,

02:37.533 --> 02:41.242
who have raised a nation of wise statesmen

02:41.370 --> 02:44.783
and invincible warriors.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.622
And on behalf of we men,

02:47.752 --> 02:50.710
I take this moment to thank you all.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.832
When the time is right,

02:56.969 --> 02:58.584
I shall make sure that you women

02:58.721 --> 03:00.712
are rewarded for your virtue.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.217
In the future, I shall enact laws

03:05.353 --> 03:09.346
that reward fertility and sanctity in marriage.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.396
I shall enact laws

03:11.525 --> 03:13.516
that severely punish adultery,

03:13.652 --> 03:16.189
promiscuity

03:16.322 --> 03:19.655
and vice of all kinds.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.079
That's very good.
I shall remember that one.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.199
If you'll excuse me.

03:29.752 --> 03:30.867
What did you think?

03:31.003 --> 03:33.415
Your speech? Oh, strong stuff.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.583
Very amusing. They bought it wholesale.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.877
I mean every word.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.591
Yes, I really think you do.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.585
Myself, I suspect the women of old Rome

03:41.722 --> 03:44.213
were a parcel of whores and termagants.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.215
We shall agree to differ.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.887
There's the young piece
I was telling you about.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.980
She's very presentable.

03:57.113 --> 03:58.944
As ordered.
lmpeccable family,

03:59.073 --> 04:01.780
young, healthy, proven fertility.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.275
— How many children?
- Just the one.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.949
A son, Tiberius.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.410
Introduce me.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.498
Caesar, may I present

04:19.635 --> 04:22.923
Alfidia and her daughter Livia?

04:23.055 --> 04:24.966
Honoured.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.759
Tell me, how would you like
to be married to me?

04:36.444 --> 04:39.151
I would like that...

04:40.281 --> 04:42.272
if my husband does not object.

04:42.408 --> 04:45.320
— What is his name?
- Claudius Nero.

04:45.453 --> 04:48.411
I know the family.
They're good, patriotic people.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.827
— They will not say no to a divorce.
- I'm sure not, sir.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.120
Excellent.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.959
See to the details.

05:00.176 --> 05:01.791
She'll do nicely.

05:01.927 --> 05:05.511
Now that other business before
I dive back into this female swamp.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.631
Herod's gold is offshore at Ostia
waiting on the high tide.

05:08.767 --> 05:12.430
I've been liaising with Antony's man, Posca,
on the details of delivery.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.646
We wanted to use the Aventine collegium
for transportation,

05:15.774 --> 05:17.184
if you are agreeable.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.649
It's a good idea.

05:18.777 --> 05:22.895
They have men allied both to myself
and to Mark Antony. That's good.

05:23.032 --> 05:27.241
Make sure the entire business is invisible.
I want complete deniability.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.030
If the bribe comes to light,

05:29.163 --> 05:31.370
it must be Antony's fault alone.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.368
Papa, when we get to Jerusalem,

05:37.505 --> 05:39.621
will Uncle Levi be there?

05:39.757 --> 05:42.294
Maybe. Maybe not.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.792
Remember when we first met?

05:44.929 --> 05:47.466
— Your cousin's house.
— Yes.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.213
I saw you and I thought,

05:49.350 --> 05:52.808
"There. There is a good man for me.

05:52.937 --> 05:57.601
"Maybe not such a nice dresser
as I would like, but a good man."

05:57.733 --> 05:59.815
It's been many years now,

06:02.530 --> 06:04.521
Papa, are we there yet?

06:06.408 --> 06:10.071
lt's gorgeous. I can have it?

06:10.204 --> 06:12.069
Anything you like, my love.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.039
My little caramel.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.408
Why don't you...

06:17.545 --> 06:20.582
go inside and see...

06:20.714 --> 06:23.877
if there's anything else you like?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.546
How good you are to me.

06:27.972 --> 06:30.179
Off you go.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.092
Take your time.

06:42.861 --> 06:46.649
You might have chosen
a less conspicuous conveyance.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.445
This is my third—best litter.
You are nondescript enough for both of us.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.205
Has the...has the Judean shipment
arrived yet?

06:58.419 --> 07:01.911
You needn't worry about them.
They don't understand a word we say.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.457
Do you, my darlings?

07:03.591 --> 07:06.754
The lower orders understand
more than you think.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.649
Really, you are too absurd.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.268
We are stealing from our own chiefs.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.817
No precaution we take is too absurd.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.487
I wouldn't call it stealing.
It is a commission for services rendered.

07:32.620 --> 07:36.579
— They won't even notice the shortfall.
- Don't fool yourself!

07:36.707 --> 07:37.992
We are thieves.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.990
lf Antony or Octavian discover it,

07:40.127 --> 07:41.833
we shall both die!

07:41.962 --> 07:43.953
They won't discover it.

07:47.343 --> 07:49.254
Where and when shall we extract our share?

07:50.346 --> 07:54.134
The Aventine men will make delivery
to the Temple of Saturn by night.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.178
You and I will be alone with the gold until day.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.893
Bring slaves you trust.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.894
— Oh, hello, Maecenas.
- Jocasta.

08:05.027 --> 08:08.144
Why on earth do you travel
in such a garish litter?

08:08.364 --> 08:11.572
I thought sure
my husband was intriguing with an actress

08:11.700 --> 08:13.691
or some such trollop.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.364
How amusing.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.783
So where are we going?

08:18.916 --> 08:22.124
The gold will be in Ostia tomorrow,
Argosy docks.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.790
The ship's name, Triton's Crown.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.504
We take it from there.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.464
By river or road?

08:29.593 --> 08:32.551
I'm told Octavian and Antony's men
will take it by river.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.387
So we'll take it by road,

08:35.516 --> 08:37.723
avoid any leaks their end.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.557
Clever.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.018
No one,

08:41.146 --> 08:43.432
no one must know what the shipment contains.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.556
Secrecy is essential.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.184
I'll use Rasca and his boys. They're reliable.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.403
— They don't ask questions.
- Good.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.024
But Pullo's gonna handle this, not you.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.775
| always handle Ostian business.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.777
This is different.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.575
You don't trust me, is it?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.367
I trust you.
Octavian and Antony, they both know Pullo.

09:05.504 --> 09:08.041
They trust him.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.256
Anything should go wrong,
it won't come back at us.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.627
It's all right. I understand.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.754
Third fucking man.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.319
Your tea, Domina.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.644
Help! Help!

10:13.781 --> 10:16.363
Help! Help, somebody!

10:16.492 --> 10:18.198
Help!

10:18.327 --> 10:21.785
Get a doctor! Get a doctor! lt's Eirene!

10:21.914 --> 10:25.327
There's blood. There's blood!

10:50.359 --> 10:53.351
She'll put you right.
No trouble.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.485
I don't think.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.104
She will.

10:57.241 --> 10:59.232
Please, no burning.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.360
In my country we are buried.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.450
Don't talk like that.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.083
No burning.

11:07.209 --> 11:10.042
Put me in a black shroud...

11:11.964 --> 11:15.877
and bury me in an open field.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.046
No trees. No trees.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.636
You're not dying.

11:21.765 --> 11:25.007
- Promise me.
— I'll not promise anything. You are not dying.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.093
Promise me.

11:28.230 --> 11:31.267
When you're old and grey,

11:31.400 --> 11:33.561
I promise I'll bury you.

11:34.945 --> 11:38.403
If I'm still around.
You'll be onto your second husband by then.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.739
The baby...

11:41.910 --> 11:43.946
Was it a boy or a girl?

11:45.497 --> 11:47.283
A boy.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.077
Bury him with me.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.750
Don't be sad.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.378
You make me cry.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.296
You gods that might know this woman

12:41.428 --> 12:43.794
as one Of your OWN,

12:43.931 --> 12:45.592
please listen to me.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.258
We here call her Eirene,

12:49.394 --> 12:52.010
but she was called Adela
where she came from,

12:52.147 --> 12:54.479
somewhere beyond the Rhine,

12:54.608 --> 12:56.769
not sure exactly where.

12:56.902 --> 12:59.985
Anyway, you'll know her.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.490
She was a good woman.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.858
She always spoke very highly of you.

13:05.994 --> 13:10.237
So please look after her

13:10.374 --> 13:12.160
and our boy.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.379
My name is Titus Pullo,

13:19.508 --> 13:21.590
ex—13th Legion,

13:23.095 --> 13:24.676
herhusband.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.968
Wasn't always as good to her
as I should have been.

13:28.100 --> 13:31.888
I give my life to you to use as you like,

13:32.020 --> 13:34.887
if you'll see that she's happy now.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.398
lt's Mascius, sir. There's trouble.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.028
Go on.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.233
Be still, Mascius. Be still.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.703
Careful, you bastard. I'm not poultry.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.697
— What happened?
— Ambush...

14:38.170 --> 14:39.956
Just before we got to the Ostian Gate.

14:57.481 --> 14:58.891
All but me and him are dead.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.811
— The gold.
— It's gone.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.822
Do you have any idea
who it was attacked you?

15:12.954 --> 15:16.082
No. They were good, though.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.449
They didn't give us a chance.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.166
And brother,

15:21.171 --> 15:23.753
they were waiting for us.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.582
All right.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.963
Call on every man.
Tell them to cover the city.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.467
Pay coin, give torture, kill if necessary.

15:39.022 --> 15:43.015
You, sit with Pullo.
Make sure he has everything he needs.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.319
l've men out all over the city looking into it.

15:47.447 --> 15:51.656
We'll find out who's responsible soon.
You can't keep a thing like this quiet.

15:51.785 --> 15:55.118
For a man who has lost his masters a fortune,
you show little shame.

15:55.247 --> 15:58.614
I took all proper precaution.
| used my best men.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.581
You used Titus Pullo?

16:02.170 --> 16:03.831
No.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.205
Why? He is your best man.

16:07.008 --> 16:10.796
His wife died in childbirth yesterday,
so I used another man.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.716
lsee.|see.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.803
Well...

16:16.935 --> 16:18.926
Very convenient.

16:19.771 --> 16:23.263
- I do not take your meaning.
— The one man we know Octavian can trust

16:23.400 --> 16:26.688
is replaced at the last minute
by who knows who?

16:26.820 --> 16:28.310
That's very convenient.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.859
Are you accusing me of being involved in this?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.857
I could just as easily accuse you.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.404
— Or Lepidus.
— That's ridiculous.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.246
No one is accusing anyone.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.866
Could it be that one of
your own men betrayed you?

16:43.003 --> 16:45.665
Anything is possible, but I doubt it.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.208
Why?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.251
They are scared of me.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.625
— Then who?
— Good question.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.218
If not one of my men, then who?

16:54.347 --> 16:57.214
Do not lay the blame elsewhere.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.056
You had custody of our property.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.051
lts loss is your responsibility.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.055
I understand.
I will find your property and bring it back.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.022
Be sure that you do.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.196
You know the consequences of failure.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.036
I'll tell you who it was.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.533
Gauls.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.825
l'll wager any amount of money it was Gauls.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.494
They breed like rabbits, you know.

17:27.631 --> 17:30.213
No notion of working for a living.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.756
Thieves, the lot of them.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.769
I know it was you.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.642
I know.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.690
You and Antony double—crossed me.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.108
— I assure you...
- No, no, no.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.449
I assure you,

17:57.577 --> 17:58.953
you'll both pay.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.144
Brother Vorenus. Welcome, sit.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.937
Have some wine.
Make a way for the captain, boys.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.821
Come alone?

18:34.781 --> 18:37.818
You celebrating something?

18:37.951 --> 18:41.159
No, we're just happy sort of people.

18:41.663 --> 18:44.951
Property in my charge was stolen
on the Ostia Way last night.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.826
— Oh, dear. What sort of property?
- Belonging to the state.

18:48.962 --> 18:52.295
That's not good.
Peeved, I'll bet, the quality.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.961
— They are.
— Wasn't us, was it?

18:55.093 --> 18:57.334
With state property? Us?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.301
No, we wouldn't dare.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.843
No, wasn't us.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.591
I didn't say it was.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.514
Just a social visit, then?

19:07.605 --> 19:10.893
If you happen to hear
who it was did this,

19:11.026 --> 19:13.187
— I'm sure you'll tell me.
— Certainly.

19:13.320 --> 19:18.235
Can't have people robbing a fellow captain.
It's humiliating. It makes us all look bad.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.698
What was it exactly, this state property?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.783
That doesn't matter.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.699
Can't help if we don't know
what we're looking for.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.074
You're right.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.293
Never mind. You've helped
more than enough already.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.414
Thank you, Memmio.
I will see you again soon.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.165
Always a pleasure.

19:39.804 --> 19:43.388
My advice — look to your own people.

19:43.516 --> 19:47.100
This kind of affair
is nearly always someone close.

19:57.530 --> 20:01.239
Go tell Cotta, Acerbo, and the other captains
I need to see them today.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.984
— Acerbo?
— You heard me.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.994
— | wish you took this seriously.
— These things happen.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.917
— It's a great deal of money.
- More money will come.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.666
A thousand rich dukes and satraps
want to be kings.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.886
But you were robbed
as if you were some petty grocer.

20:23.014 --> 20:26.222
Tell me, why do you
take such personal offence at this?

20:26.351 --> 20:28.592
It is a gross personal insult to you.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.435
Someone is always insulting me.
It's the price of fame.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.681
Mark Antony
is your colleague and brother—in—law.

20:34.818 --> 20:39.187
If you have proof that Mark Antony
is responsible, tell me.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.278
Who else knew of the shipment?

20:41.408 --> 20:44.400
- Lepidus?
— Very possibly. It's likely it was an accident.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.868
There are no accidents. It was Antony.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.453
Since we reconciled,
he has been just and honest.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.198
I won't jeopardize our alliance
because you dislike him.

20:52.335 --> 20:55.623
I know for a fact he's been
neither just nor honest with you.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.291
He's been making a fool of you.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.836
What do you mean?

21:00.969 --> 21:04.962
Forgive me, I thought it best not to tell you.
Your alliance, the wellbeing of the republic...

21:05.098 --> 21:06.884
Speak!

21:08.935 --> 21:11.551
Antony's marriage to your sister is a sham.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.644
He's been bedding your mother as before.

21:13.773 --> 21:18.563
That's impossible. Antony would not dare
disrespect me like that, and Octavia...

21:18.695 --> 21:20.526
Octavia would have told me.

21:22.449 --> 21:25.441
She has her own reasons for keeping silent.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.831
Domina, your son summons you

21:33.960 --> 21:35.291
to dinner this evening.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.627
Tell him no. I am going to the theatre.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.963
He says it's important.
Attendance is compulsory.

21:41.092 --> 21:44.084
He's getting more and more officious.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.300
Who else is coming?

21:49.017 --> 21:51.133
Just family.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.646
Thank you all for coming so promptly.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.811
l have urgent business to discuss.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.686
- With these?
— Patience, Cotta.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.064
— You'll like what I have to say.
- Giving half price on olive oil?

22:06.201 --> 22:10.820
No. Rather, I was thinking
of getting deeper into the grain trade.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.584
Things with brother Vorenus
are coming to a head.

22:17.712 --> 22:21.170
I'm thinking it's time
to put an end to his arrogance.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.506
So it was you.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.174
— You took his gold.
— What gold is that?

22:28.306 --> 22:31.389
The gold every beggar in the city
is talking about. It was you.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.225
Might have been. I don't say that it was
but it might have been.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.061
— And you kept it from me?
— Kept what from you?

22:37.190 --> 22:39.146
— Don'tjoke with me.
— You took his gold?

22:39.275 --> 22:40.936
Vorenus thinks I did.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.404
So he's after your head
on a stick and you're scared.

22:47.534 --> 22:51.152
- What's that to us?
— No one can handle the Aventine on their own.

22:51.287 --> 22:55.075
But if all of us were to cooperate,
like the brothers we are, different story.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.573
-Smw!
— We'll crush them.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.997
The Aventine will be ours.
The grain trade will be ours.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.381
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:07.262 --> 23:10.470
I don't expect you to help me
out of brotherly love.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.187
That's it, boys.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.610
That's what you want, isn't it?

23:30.743 --> 23:33.826
Yes! Pick it up!

23:33.955 --> 23:35.616
Missed a bit there. Look.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.581
That's what you want, a bit more!

23:38.710 --> 23:42.202
Here it comes. More! More!

23:42.338 --> 23:46.206
That's right! Now, pick it up.

24:01.149 --> 24:05.392
Forgive me.
| unnerve you with my silence.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.978
No, sir.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.276
What small hands you have.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.204
—Sodw.
— Thank you.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.668
Tell me, does your husband ever beat you?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.537
No, sir.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.666
I hope I have never given him reason to do so.

24:30.678 --> 24:34.045
— Your father, perhaps?
- No, sir.

24:34.182 --> 24:37.549
A virtuous woman.
Good. That is good.

24:41.481 --> 24:46.475
You should know that when we are married,
I shall, on occasion, beat you,

24:46.611 --> 24:50.445
with my hand or a light whip.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.655
When I do, do not think you have offended me.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.366
I do it because it gives me sexual pleasure.

24:57.580 --> 25:00.743
You must remember that and not be upset.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.331
Yes, sir.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.463
I think we shall get along very well.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.719
They're all here.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.233
About time.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.820
Any news from Lucius Vorenus?

25:33.700 --> 25:36.487
— No.
— Strange.

25:36.619 --> 25:39.952
We must be patient. Vorenus always does
what he says he'll do.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.239
— I am glad you think so.
— And who is this sweet creature?

25:43.376 --> 25:47.039
This is Livia, daughter of
Livius Drusus Claudianus.

25:47.171 --> 25:52.586
- I'm going to marry her.
— How nice. Welcome to the family.

25:52.719 --> 25:55.836
Thank you. I am glad to make
your acquaintance.

25:55.972 --> 25:59.180
And this must be my sister Octavia.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.889
Such a lovely complexion she has.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.804
What a furtive person you are.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.144
I had no inkling you were looking to marry.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.262
I wanted her to be here

26:06.399 --> 26:10.187
so she would properly understand
what it means to be a part of this family.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.605
It's a species of benign slavery.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.229
Slavery, is it?

26:16.159 --> 26:18.821
Well, you fancy yourself
a Spartacus then, do you?

26:18.953 --> 26:21.319
— I don't follow.
— I am master of this family,

26:21.456 --> 26:23.037
and you have rebelled against me.

26:23.166 --> 26:27.660
- | wish I had such courage.
— You are courageous enough. I was surprised.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.787
I knew Mother had the stomach
for any kind of depravity,

26:30.923 --> 26:33.084
but you, l was surprised.

26:33.217 --> 26:36.550
l have shown you nothing but love
and you repay me with treachery.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.341
Remember, colleague,

26:39.474 --> 26:43.217
— you are talking to my wife.
- Your wife in name only.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.968
It is still Mother that performs
the wifely function, is it not?

26:46.105 --> 26:50.018
While Octavia does the same
for my good friend Agrippa.

26:50.151 --> 26:52.563
That's very convenient for all involved.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.936
— What are you getting at?
— Do you deny it?

26:55.072 --> 26:58.485
— I'll not be interrogated by you!
- Do you deny it?

26:58.618 --> 27:01.325
Fuck your little girl
and leave my business to me!

27:01.454 --> 27:03.695
— Do you deny it?
- It's true.

27:07.502 --> 27:09.993
I'll not deny it.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.746
I love your sister.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.466
We have been meeting
in secret for some time now.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.466
But I cannot answer for Antony.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.965
Thank you.
Thank you for being honest with me.

27:24.936 --> 27:29.179
So what? What if it is true?
What are you gonna do about it?

27:29.315 --> 27:31.431
There is nothing you can do about it.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.979
I shall send my women to their house,

27:34.111 --> 27:36.568
where they shall remain
in seclusion under guard

27:36.697 --> 27:38.608
— until I say so.
— I'll do no such thing!

27:38.741 --> 27:39.947
Silence.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.284
You, you shall leave this city.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.370
- Leave this city?
— You shall go east to your provinces

27:46.499 --> 27:49.991
— and you shall not come back.
- Or else what, boy?

27:50.127 --> 27:52.869
Leave this city,
or I declare our alliance is broken.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.337
I shall have this sad story told in the Forum.

27:55.466 --> 27:58.208
I will have it posted in every city in Italy.

27:58.344 --> 28:02.337
And you know, the people
are not so liberal with their wives as you are.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.429
They will say you wear cuckold's horns.

28:04.559 --> 28:08.393
They will say your wife betrayed you
with a lowborn pleb on my staff.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.809
You will be a figure of fun.

28:11.941 --> 28:14.227
The proles will laugh at you in the street.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.898
Your soldiers will mock you behind your back.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.367
Go on. Strike me.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.043
See what happens.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.404
Oh, and Antony,

29:02.533 --> 29:05.491
if you find that gold,
you'll be sure to tell me, won't you?

29:09.749 --> 29:14.584
— You would disgrace your own sister?
— She has disgraced herself.

29:16.672 --> 29:19.004
It was nice to meet you.

29:19.133 --> 29:20.839
Take care.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.504
You're marrying a monster.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.434
Take them home. Take guards with you.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.777
Make sure they get home...safely.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.151
It was you who told him, wasn't it?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.949
| always knew you were a weasel.

29:51.082 --> 29:54.449
| wish I could apologize,
madam, but it was my duty.

29:54.585 --> 29:58.954
You've done your master a terrible disservice.
Now he has no family at all.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.467
Maecenas.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.347
Do not blame him.
He did what he thought was right.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.388
— I do not think you can say the same.
— For which I apologize.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.978
But do not let Octavia suffer for my sins.

30:17.608 --> 30:20.020
The fault is mine.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.768
It was I seduced her.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.987
You have many talents, Agrippa.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.983
Seduction is not one of them.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.534
She does not deserve your cruelty.

30:31.122 --> 30:33.534
— She's not...
— l've stated my intentions.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.156
You will not be banished. I need you.

30:35.292 --> 30:39.661
Besides, your sudden disappearance
would suggest some sort of scandal.

30:42.383 --> 30:43.668
I thank you.

30:43.801 --> 30:45.337
You can go.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.642
Try one of the stuffed songbirds.

30:55.771 --> 30:58.183
My cook does them particularly well.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.960
Has he eaten?

31:23.007 --> 31:24.372
Water?

31:29.472 --> 31:31.588
Pullo.

31:31.724 --> 31:35.433
Pullo, you've had no water in two days.
You need to drink something.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.394
Mascius looked in. Cut up nasty.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.728
Drink.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.149
Gold got stolen, did it?

31:45.905 --> 31:48.362
All but Mascius and Zeno are dead.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.364
Don't you worry about it.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.572
|'||...|'|| get it back.

31:55.289 --> 31:56.745
Memmio?

31:57.792 --> 31:59.953
Looks like. I went to see him.

32:00.086 --> 32:03.874
He had guilt written on his face very plain.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.039
Who told him?

32:06.175 --> 32:09.167
He as good as said
it was one of my own people.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.295
Mascius.

32:13.474 --> 32:15.260
— He's not been happy.
— And he lived.

32:15.392 --> 32:18.134
Still, he's always been loyal.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.477
Never had to doubt him before.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.606
No one's a traitor until they are.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.603
Pullo, where are you going?

32:48.676 --> 32:49.916
Mascius.

32:54.056 --> 32:56.138
All right, Pullo.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.174
Boss.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.302
How are you feeling?

33:02.398 --> 33:04.935
Not so bad. l was lucky.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.315
Very lucky.

33:08.696 --> 33:09.651
No word yet?

33:10.656 --> 33:12.362
Give it back!

33:12.491 --> 33:15.654
- Give it!
— Children, quiet.

33:19.165 --> 33:22.248
The only thing I can think of is maybe...

33:23.294 --> 33:25.956
Maybe one of Octavian
or Antony's men set it all up.

33:26.088 --> 33:29.922
Couldn't be. They thought we'd go by river.
Didn't know we'd use the road.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.586
True.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.711
Memmio said that we should
look to one of our own.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.183
Listen...

33:40.102 --> 33:41.717
brother,

33:41.854 --> 33:43.185
our lives are on the line.

33:43.314 --> 33:45.726
You wanted the responsibility.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.395
— We just want some answers.
- It had to be you.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.018
You'rejoking. You think I did this myself?

33:51.155 --> 33:55.239
Mascius, the only people who knew
what the plan was was we three here.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.153
Third fucking man.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.868
- It wasn't me.
— Give it back!

34:00.915 --> 34:02.906
Give me that. Get out of here.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.534
Don't come back in here!

34:08.923 --> 34:10.584
Just tell the truth.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.301
I'm sorry, brother.

34:23.437 --> 34:27.225
Near on 20 years marching together,
you boys and me.

34:28.525 --> 34:31.938
— Tell the truth.
— The truth?

34:32.071 --> 34:35.234
The truth is l have known you as a brother.

34:35.366 --> 34:37.982
The truth is I saved your life at Gergovia.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.738
Took an arrow for it.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.953
Arrow's still in there.

34:43.082 --> 34:46.415
The truth is I'd do it again, brother.

34:46.543 --> 34:51.503
The truth is I've been nothing but
a good soldier and a good fucking friend.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.463
You do what you have to do, brother.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.594
See you in Hades.

35:01.934 --> 35:05.017
— Where's the gold?
— Pullo! Lucius!

35:05.145 --> 35:06.351
— What?
— Lucius!

35:08.941 --> 35:11.102
Where did you get this?

35:19.368 --> 35:21.108
Father.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.570
Father, stop it.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.321
Stop it!

35:26.458 --> 35:28.835
Stop it! What are you doing? Stop it!

35:28.961 --> 35:30.667
Father! Stop it!

35:42.641 --> 35:45.018
— Where'd you get these?
— I bought them.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.180
Don't you lie to me.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.223
Idid.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.186
One of Memmio's men gave them to you.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.022
- Didn't he?
— No, I don't know...

35:52.151 --> 35:54.016
— Don't you lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

35:58.574 --> 36:00.439
You get back here.
Get back here!

36:04.830 --> 36:07.537
It was you, wasn't it? It was you.
You went to Memmio.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.157
It was you who betrayed me.

36:11.170 --> 36:14.037
You've been whoring yourself
to one of Memmio's men.

36:14.173 --> 36:17.040
You've been whoring yourself
to the whole damn Caelian.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.462
That's not true. He loves me.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.210
He loves me and I love him.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.884
How could you be so stupid?

36:24.016 --> 36:25.347
He was using you to get to me.

36:25.476 --> 36:27.842
You know nothing about it.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.764
He loves me.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.638
And for love of this scum

36:32.775 --> 36:34.561
you would betray your own father?

36:34.693 --> 36:37.435
Oh, yes! I betrayed you!

36:37.571 --> 36:40.358
And I was glad to do it.

36:46.497 --> 36:48.078
Why?

36:49.500 --> 36:52.116
Why? Why? Why would you do that?

36:52.252 --> 36:54.959
You killed my mother.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.624
You cursed us to Hades.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.718
You made me a fucking whore.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.633
And you ask why?

37:05.766 --> 37:07.131
Because I hate you.

37:07.267 --> 37:10.930
I hate you! We all hate you.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.429
I wish you were dead.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.781
Go ahead.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.071
Try and kill me like you killed Mother.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.445
I'll not go so easy.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.321
— I didn't kill her.
- Liar.

37:31.458 --> 37:34.165
- I didn't.
— She didn't love you. You killed her for it.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.000
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

37:36.130 --> 37:38.416
— She never loved you.
— You shut your mouth.

37:38.549 --> 37:41.006
— She never loved you.
— You shut...shut...

37:41.135 --> 37:43.751
Keep your mouth shut!

37:48.851 --> 37:50.261
Vorenus.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.352
Vorenus.

38:41.487 --> 38:45.025
Our noble triumvirate
announces the immediate departure

38:45.157 --> 38:49.025
from the city of his honour Mark Antony.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.994
He will take up his seat in Alexandria

38:52.122 --> 38:54.955
as supreme governor of Egypt

38:55.083 --> 38:57.074
and the eastern provinces.

38:59.922 --> 39:03.130
Tomorrow, at the house of Rufus,

39:03.258 --> 39:06.716
an auction of excellent slaves,

39:06.845 --> 39:10.383
from pliant virgins to learned Greeks,

39:10.516 --> 39:14.259
Rufus has slaves for every budget.

39:27.991 --> 39:32.200
Make way for the Triumvir Mark Antony.

39:32.329 --> 39:35.321
Orders of his honour Triumvir Octavian Caesar,

39:35.457 --> 39:38.244
none shall enter this house.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.368
Shall we use force?

39:43.966 --> 39:45.752
No.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.893
Atia!

40:04.861 --> 40:06.647
Atia!

40:13.579 --> 40:15.615
Out of my way, you little insects.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.829
You cannot leave without permission.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.494
Atia, calm.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.826
Leave it be.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.882
I just want to talk.

40:38.895 --> 40:42.262
Don't push me to violence, centurion.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.443
Just talk.

40:58.749 --> 41:00.535
I'm leaving tomorrow.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.753
Very well.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.710
Goodbye, then.

41:19.061 --> 41:21.052
When the time comes,

41:22.314 --> 41:23.178
I'll send for you.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.397
When will that be?

41:25.525 --> 41:26.776
Who can say?

41:28.862 --> 41:30.363
We must be patient.

41:30.489 --> 41:33.572
Promise me. Promise me you'll send for me.

41:34.493 --> 41:38.111
On my life, I promise.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.407
Burn it.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.398
- And this?
— I don't know.

42:16.535 --> 42:20.027
Burn it. Wipe your arse with it.
I really don't care.

42:35.512 --> 42:36.922
Well, well.

42:37.973 --> 42:39.304
Lucius Vorenus.

42:40.350 --> 42:41.931
You found my gold yet?

42:42.060 --> 42:45.348
— I know where it is.
- And?

42:45.480 --> 42:48.142
Titus Pullo will retrieve it.

42:50.235 --> 42:53.602
I have resigned from the collegium.

42:53.739 --> 42:57.106
— Resigned?
— It's a personal matter.

42:58.368 --> 43:02.782
I have no doubt Pullo will not let you down.

43:02.914 --> 43:06.031
I had no doubt that you would not
let me down, but here we are.

43:06.168 --> 43:09.035
For that, I apologize.

43:13.550 --> 43:17.042
I am come to offer you my services

43:17.179 --> 43:19.716
in Egypt, if you will take me.

43:19.848 --> 43:23.136
Your services? In Egypt?

43:28.106 --> 43:30.939
I cannot stay in Rome, sir.

43:36.698 --> 43:40.486
Let me go to Egypt with you.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.234
Please.

43:48.043 --> 43:49.624
All right.

43:52.297 --> 43:54.288
Come with me.

43:54.424 --> 43:56.210
I need good men.

43:58.261 --> 44:00.468
You'll not turn to drink, will you?

44:01.681 --> 44:03.182
No, sir.

44:03.308 --> 44:06.516
Well, you stoic types often do

44:06.645 --> 44:08.852
when disappointed in life.

44:16.071 --> 44:17.857
Welcome aboard.

44:19.699 --> 44:21.906
Thank you, sir.

44:27.249 --> 44:30.787
— What did he say?
— We sail tomorrow.

44:30.919 --> 44:33.752
You're not gonna come back
and say goodbye?

44:35.841 --> 44:37.206
No.

44:39.511 --> 44:41.547
Vorena's got your blood in her.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.716
Doesn't forgive easy.
And she's young.

44:43.849 --> 44:47.137
— Girls...
— Pullo, it's best this way.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.013
You'll take good care of them?

44:58.280 --> 45:00.271
Tell them...

45:04.119 --> 45:06.280
Tell them I tried.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.119
Gods protect you, brother.

45:14.421 --> 45:15.627
And you, brother.

46:19.361 --> 46:21.818
— Don't do that.
— Why not?

46:21.947 --> 46:23.812
I paid good money for those flowers.

46:24.824 --> 46:27.611
You'll leave the place a desert if you carry on.

46:29.079 --> 46:31.035
I've nothing better to do.

46:32.332 --> 46:34.948
In the kitchen you might find something
to amuse you.

46:35.085 --> 46:38.293
What? Help cook peel onions?

46:38.421 --> 46:39.501
Better than that.

46:39.631 --> 46:41.792
Well, not much better, in my opinion.

46:41.925 --> 46:44.462
You always did have lamentable taste in men.

46:46.054 --> 46:47.510
Go on.

46:48.807 --> 46:51.389
And don't let the guards see you smile.

46:51.518 --> 46:54.351
They'll know something's amiss. Go on.

47:13.081 --> 47:15.322
How on earth did you get in?

47:15.458 --> 47:18.245
Octavian's men don't let a mouse get by them.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.790
Your mother could outfox Ulysses.

47:21.923 --> 47:24.835
Well, if she can get you inside,
perhaps she can get me out.

47:24.968 --> 47:27.129
We could run away together.

47:27.762 --> 47:30.219
It's a nice thought but...

47:30.348 --> 47:32.384
- ..it's not possible.
— We could try, at least.

47:32.517 --> 47:35.384
— No.
— Why not? I have a little money.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.603
We could go to the east.
He couldn't reach us there.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.147
I would go with you to Hades,

47:42.277 --> 47:45.644
to Britain, even,
if I thought we had the right.

47:46.156 --> 47:47.487
But we don't.

47:47.615 --> 47:49.151
Right?

47:51.036 --> 47:53.618
What right has he to keep me captive?

47:54.914 --> 47:56.825
— What right has he to...
— Please.

47:56.958 --> 47:58.744
Don't be angry.

47:58.877 --> 48:02.335
He has every legal and moral right
to do with us as he wishes.

48:04.382 --> 48:06.418
He has forgiven me.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.667
And he remains my friend.

48:10.221 --> 48:13.634
I cannot repay his forgiveness
by betraying him a second time.

48:17.270 --> 48:20.262
Well, why are you here, then?

48:24.527 --> 48:26.358
I'm here to say goodbye.

48:27.739 --> 48:29.229
Where are you going?

48:29.908 --> 48:33.241
I mean, we shall see each other again,

48:33.828 --> 48:35.489
quite often, I expect.

48:37.582 --> 48:41.575
But our relations will be formal and correct
as they should be.

48:45.715 --> 48:47.091
Coward.

48:48.468 --> 48:49.799
You're a miserable coward.

48:49.928 --> 48:53.136
- Octavia...
— No. I understand.

48:53.264 --> 48:55.641
You love my brother
and the power he gives you.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.974
Why throw that all away for a woman?

48:58.103 --> 49:00.310
It'd be very foolish.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.684
Goodbye.

49:07.570 --> 49:10.528
Oh, by the way,

49:10.657 --> 49:12.363
I'm having a baby.

49:14.953 --> 49:16.238
Who is the father?

49:17.330 --> 49:18.945
Who knows?

49:20.416 --> 49:24.785
Neither man is worth a brass obol,
so what matter?

50:35.617 --> 50:36.823
Go, go, go!

50:44.876 --> 50:46.832
Quickly, shut the door.

51:03.645 --> 51:04.634
Come on!

51:32.090 --> 51:34.251
Titus Pullo.

51:39.097 --> 51:40.678
A parley.

51:46.062 --> 51:49.099
Brother Pullo, I have no quarrel with you.

51:49.232 --> 51:51.473
You're a reasonable man like I am.

51:51.609 --> 51:55.443
It's that madman Vorenus took us to this pass.

51:57.282 --> 52:00.069
No reason you and me can't do business.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.182
13!

53:41.010 --> 53:44.002
Stand firm! Don't run, you cowards!

54:40.278 --> 54:41.609
Antony.

55:05.887 --> 55:07.468
Cleopatra.
