00:01.208 --> 00:02.933
<i>Previously on "The Rookie Feds..."</i>

00:03.072 --> 00:05.384
<i>I just met your daughter.
She single?</i>

00:05.522 --> 00:06.420
Very.

00:06.558 --> 00:08.042
<i>You best slow that roll.</i>

00:08.180 --> 00:09.906
<i>My dad is uncomfortable
with me dating the daughter</i>

00:10.044 --> 00:11.390
<i>of a woman he's dating.</i>

00:11.528 --> 00:13.772
I am finally living my dream.

00:13.910 --> 00:15.222
So this is
the end of the road?

00:15.360 --> 00:19.674
Our relationships
are about timing.

00:19.812 --> 00:22.539
And I guess
this just isn't ours.

00:36.691 --> 00:38.762
He hasn't had a visitor
here in over two years.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.695
Guess that makes you special.

00:44.389 --> 00:46.218
Hands where I can see them.

00:46.356 --> 00:50.050
Move and I'll mace you
in the face.

01:05.341 --> 01:10.104
Matthew, you look good.

01:10.242 --> 01:11.588
Yeah, well, you don't.

01:11.726 --> 01:13.763
And you're gonna look
even worse in 36 hours.

01:13.901 --> 01:17.111
Or better.
Who knows?

01:17.249 --> 01:19.631
Maybe death will suit me.

01:19.769 --> 01:22.323
Lethal injection
suits no one, Foster.

01:22.461 --> 01:24.222
Tears your insides apart.

01:24.360 --> 01:27.432
Still, there is
a certain solace

01:27.570 --> 01:29.744
knowing when
you're going to die,

01:29.882 --> 01:34.232
the day, the exact time.

01:34.370 --> 01:37.407
I often think of the man
I was when we first met,

01:37.545 --> 01:40.445
arrogant, blinded by rage.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.826
Waste your own time,
Foster, but not mine.

01:42.964 --> 01:44.656
You said you had
additional murders

01:44.794 --> 01:45.760
to confess to.
Huh?

01:45.898 --> 01:49.626
I do.
What time is it?

01:53.320 --> 01:55.529
It's 9:58.

01:55.667 --> 01:59.119
8:58 on the West Coast,

01:59.257 --> 02:04.986
which means
they haven't happened...

02:05.125 --> 02:06.367
yet.

02:13.512 --> 02:16.377
<i>18 years ago,
I had a great purpose,</i>

02:16.515 --> 02:19.484
but I was too proud.
- Proud?

02:19.622 --> 02:21.486
You killed people
with anthrax letters.

02:21.624 --> 02:23.004
You were a coward.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.491
<i>I know who I was
and who I've become.</i>

02:26.629 --> 02:29.563
I have been awakened.

02:29.701 --> 02:33.877
<i>I am but an instrument
used by a higher power.</i>

02:34.015 --> 02:35.465
Oh, please.

02:35.603 --> 02:37.157
Please don't tell me
that you found God in here.

02:37.295 --> 02:42.507
Not God, his opposite.

02:42.645 --> 02:44.716
<i>Let's just cut
right to the chase.</i>

02:44.854 --> 02:46.373
What have you done?

02:46.511 --> 02:49.721
I have waited decades
for this moment.

02:49.859 --> 02:51.895
<i>I always felt alone
in my existence,</i>

02:52.033 --> 02:54.035
the lone and lonely man

02:54.174 --> 02:55.865
lashing out
against the corrupt.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.731
Darkness has shown me
that I am

02:59.869 --> 03:03.666
but a drop of water
in a vast river.

03:03.804 --> 03:06.876
Only as one
can you be destroyed.

03:07.014 --> 03:09.016
So you working with
someone on the outside?

03:09.154 --> 03:10.914
Someone?

03:11.052 --> 03:13.331
No, no, no, no, Matthew.

03:13.469 --> 03:16.437
I have many.

03:23.893 --> 03:26.758
Ooh.

03:31.245 --> 03:36.112
OK, Daddy, sneaking in
in last night's clothes.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.079
Go ahead
and do your walk of shame.

03:38.218 --> 03:42.049
Shame was definitely not
what Ruth and I

03:42.187 --> 03:44.776
were feeling last night
or this morning.

03:44.914 --> 03:46.571
OK.

03:46.709 --> 03:48.711
Now, baby girl,
I'm too old for shame.

03:48.849 --> 03:51.576
OK, and I'm too young
for this conversation.

03:51.714 --> 03:53.405
You and Miss Ruth
have been spending

03:53.543 --> 03:55.545
a lot of time together lately.

03:55.683 --> 03:58.445
I told her I love her.

03:58.583 --> 04:00.067
Daddy, is that the first time

04:00.205 --> 04:02.828
you've said
that since Mama died?

04:02.966 --> 04:05.314
And you said you would
never find love again.

04:05.452 --> 04:07.316
Ah!
Look at God.

04:07.454 --> 04:10.146
Won't He do it?
- Oh, one more thing.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.804
We're thinking about
moving in together.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.739
You know, Daddy,

04:16.877 --> 04:19.155
Ruth's place
is twice as big as ours,

04:19.293 --> 04:21.226
and she has a pool.

04:21.364 --> 04:23.504
I will miss you.
I will.

04:23.642 --> 04:25.437
But you will be
right up the street,

04:25.575 --> 04:28.026
and you can visit anytime.
- OK.

04:28.164 --> 04:30.028
Now, slow down your roll,
baby girl.

04:30.166 --> 04:33.514
The house is not yours yet.

04:33.652 --> 04:36.655
We just talking about it.
No decisions have been made.

04:36.793 --> 04:40.797
That means that I'm gonna be
running into Dina quite a bit,

04:40.935 --> 04:42.868
which could get awkward.

04:43.006 --> 04:46.113
Do not say I told you so
'cause you did warn me,

04:46.251 --> 04:47.666
but it's OK.

04:47.804 --> 04:48.978
I mean,
our parents are in love,

04:49.116 --> 04:53.258
and we're both adults,
and it'll be fine.

04:53.396 --> 04:55.433
Probably.
<i>- Hey, you.</i>

04:55.571 --> 04:57.020
Hi.

04:57.158 --> 04:58.263
Thought I'd pick you up
a little pick-me-up.

04:58.401 --> 05:00.369
What you working on?

05:00.507 --> 05:04.062
- I'm analyzing paint quality.
- For what case?

05:04.200 --> 05:07.376
The case of which color
will look best in my duplex?

05:07.514 --> 05:09.067
I've tested
all the paint brands,

05:09.205 --> 05:12.173
and Benjamin Moore is superior.
- You don't live in a duplex.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.831
No, I'm repainting one
of my rental properties.

05:14.969 --> 05:17.075
I have new tenants.
- What?

05:17.213 --> 05:20.112
You're a--a landlord?
And you said properties.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.390
Is that, like, multiple?

05:21.528 --> 05:23.219
Why didn't you
tell me about that?

05:23.357 --> 05:24.876
We haven't dated that long.

05:25.014 --> 05:27.672
I like to maintain
an aura of mystery.

05:27.810 --> 05:30.019
Keeps the romance alive.
- Yeah.

05:30.157 --> 05:34.748
I support that, I guess.

05:34.886 --> 05:38.510
Speaking of which, I hope
this isn't a romance killer,

05:38.648 --> 05:40.823
but I got a Google alert

05:40.961 --> 05:44.171
from one of
those dumb gossip sites,

05:44.309 --> 05:48.244
and, well, there you go.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.903
Is that a photo of us
from dinner last night

05:52.041 --> 05:53.698
on the internet?

05:53.836 --> 05:56.839
Yeah.

05:56.977 --> 05:59.151
"'Vampire Cop's' New Boo:

05:59.289 --> 06:02.603
"lucky sucker Brendon Acres

06:02.741 --> 06:05.434
with a date we'd all
like to take a bite of."

06:05.572 --> 06:07.436
It's really crass.
I'm sorry.

06:07.574 --> 06:09.852
Don't be.
I look fabulous.

06:09.990 --> 06:13.959
- Oh, you're not upset?
- I don't love it.

06:14.097 --> 06:16.721
But I know what
I signed on for with you.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.448
There's a terrorist attack
in San Francisco.

06:19.586 --> 06:20.794
Wheels up in 20.
- Good luck.

06:20.932 --> 06:23.106
- Yeah.
- No, you're coming with us.

06:25.281 --> 06:26.972
<i>A drone was piloted
into the boardroom</i>

06:27.110 --> 06:28.595
<i>of a San Francisco hedge fund.</i>

06:28.733 --> 06:30.976
<i>It released some kind
of unknown poisonous gas</i>

06:31.114 --> 06:33.082
<i>killing six people
almost instantly.</i>

06:33.220 --> 06:34.808
Sounds like
a biological weapon.

06:34.946 --> 06:36.223
Any indication as to which?

06:36.361 --> 06:37.638
Well, that's the reason
why you're on that plane,

06:37.776 --> 06:39.260
Antoinette.
You're gonna find out for us.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.262
Any idea
who's behind the attack?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.609
Foster Mills.

06:42.747 --> 06:44.162
How is that even possible

06:44.300 --> 06:45.991
when he's on death row
in Idaho?

06:46.129 --> 06:47.648
<i>Yeah, which is where
I'm calling from.</i>

06:47.786 --> 06:49.995
<i>Foster is scheduled
to be executed tomorrow night,</i>

06:50.133 --> 06:51.583
<i>and apparently,
he's not going quietly.</i>

06:51.721 --> 06:53.792
Somehow,
he managed to put this attack

06:53.930 --> 06:56.105
in motion even though
he lives under a microscope.

06:56.243 --> 06:57.382
But do we know why he
would target a hedge fund?

06:57.520 --> 06:58.763
That's an unknown,

06:58.901 --> 07:00.489
but I expect that you'll
get clarity at the scene.

07:00.627 --> 07:02.836
Don't worry about it, boss.
We got your back.

07:02.974 --> 07:04.354
<i>No, not you, Simone.</i>

07:04.493 --> 07:06.149
The jet's gonna drop you off
here in Idaho

07:06.287 --> 07:08.151
and take the rest of the team
to San Francisco.

07:08.289 --> 07:09.325
<i>Why?</i>

07:09.463 --> 07:11.085
Because I need a wild card,
OK?

07:11.223 --> 07:13.812
Foster has me here
for a reason.

07:13.950 --> 07:15.296
He understands how I operate.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.677
He's got some sort of game plan

07:16.815 --> 07:18.161
as to how he's gonna
play this thing out,

07:18.299 --> 07:20.025
so I want him off balance.

07:20.163 --> 07:22.165
I want him on his heels,
and that's where you come in.

07:22.303 --> 07:24.029
It's the only way
we're gonna get to the truth.

07:24.167 --> 07:26.031
You know
how I'm always saying

07:26.169 --> 07:28.551
don't doubt the power
of Black girl magic?

07:28.689 --> 07:31.934
<i>Even that has its limitations.
- Hopefully not on this one.</i>

07:32.072 --> 07:34.695
Because if I know this guy,
what happened in San Francisco

07:34.833 --> 07:35.869
is just the beginning.

07:37.698 --> 07:39.389
<i>You were the one
who brought him in.</i>

07:39.528 --> 07:41.978
I mean, boss, you know him
better than anyone.

07:42.116 --> 07:43.877
What's not in his file?

07:44.015 --> 07:45.154
He's found religion,

07:45.292 --> 07:47.018
or some perverted version
of it.

07:47.156 --> 07:49.158
Sees himself as channeling
a darker power.

07:49.296 --> 07:51.367
Do we think that's real,

07:51.505 --> 07:54.025
or does he just have us
out here chasing shadows?

07:54.163 --> 07:56.303
That's an unknown.
He definitely talks the talk.

07:56.441 --> 07:57.960
But our priority is to find out

07:58.098 --> 07:59.858
how he managed
to orchestrate a mass murder

07:59.996 --> 08:02.930
from solitary confinement, OK?
The rest is just a distraction.

08:03.068 --> 08:04.449
Yes, sir.

08:04.587 --> 08:05.795
I'm not looking for magic,

08:05.933 --> 08:08.142
and I'm not expecting
a miracle, OK?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.593
Foster's just like any other
high school malcontent

08:10.731 --> 08:12.733
that sat in your office
and thought that their anarchy

08:12.871 --> 08:15.080
made them special.
That's it.

08:15.218 --> 08:17.876
Maybe, but none of them came

08:18.014 --> 08:21.501
with a body count
or a ticking clock.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.198
How'd they get the drone
inside the building?

08:29.336 --> 08:30.510
Scrubbing surveillance
footage now,

08:30.648 --> 08:31.994
but we're thinking loading bay.

08:32.132 --> 08:33.616
Would take
a pretty skilled pilot

08:33.754 --> 08:35.653
to fly through this entire
building with no eyes on it.

08:35.791 --> 08:37.102
Assume nothing.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.933
Pilot could work here
or pose as a delivery person

08:40.071 --> 08:42.452
who walked the flight path
a day ago.

08:42.591 --> 08:44.558
We'll pull footage
going back two weeks.

08:44.696 --> 08:46.111
We need to examine
that drone ASAP.

08:46.249 --> 08:47.630
No one's going in there
until the CDC's

08:47.768 --> 08:49.459
chemical emergency response
team can decontaminate.

08:49.598 --> 08:51.082
They'll be here in a few hours.
- We can't wait.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.428
Another attack
could be imminent.

08:52.566 --> 08:53.740
I'll go in.

08:53.878 --> 08:55.638
I have extensive hazardous
materials training.

08:55.776 --> 08:58.296
I just need a suit.
- You don't have to do that.

08:58.434 --> 09:00.540
And you don't have to run
after the sound of gunshots,

09:00.678 --> 09:03.819
but you do.
I'm a forensic biologist.

09:03.957 --> 09:06.787
If I could stop more people
from ending up like that,

09:06.925 --> 09:10.273
I'm going to do it.
Let's go.

09:10.411 --> 09:11.861
Let's get you suited up.

09:22.941 --> 09:24.115
You all right, ma'am?

09:24.253 --> 09:27.290
It takes more
than bad manners to spook me.

09:27.428 --> 09:29.707
29.

09:39.130 --> 09:41.995
Matthew tapped out already?

09:42.133 --> 09:44.791
He had to get back to DC.

09:44.929 --> 09:47.103
Don't start our relationship
off with a lie.

09:47.241 --> 09:49.140
He's listening
right now, isn't he?

09:49.278 --> 09:51.004
Yes, he is.

09:51.142 --> 09:54.145
Agent Garza is my boss.

09:54.283 --> 09:56.492
<i>He sent me to speak with you.</i>

09:56.630 --> 10:00.876
And what if I refuse
to talk to you?

10:01.014 --> 10:05.156
Well, then I go back home,
and I'm not sad about it.

10:05.294 --> 10:08.469
But I have a feeling
you are way more interested

10:08.608 --> 10:10.955
in what happened
in San Francisco

10:11.093 --> 10:14.475
than saying goodbye.
Am I right?

10:31.838 --> 10:33.771
Victims show
signs of hypotension

10:33.909 --> 10:36.601
with evident cyanosis.

10:43.746 --> 10:45.955
I'm fine.

10:46.093 --> 10:47.647
<i>Whatever they were exposed to</i>

10:47.785 --> 10:50.097
most likely
suffocated them painfully.

10:52.306 --> 10:53.342
You can step away
if you need to.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.688
No, I'm fine.

10:54.826 --> 10:56.379
<i>Blood test
will be conclusive,</i>

10:56.517 --> 10:58.485
but if I had to guess,
I would say

10:58.623 --> 11:00.798
the gas was hydrogen cyanide.

11:00.936 --> 11:03.870
<i>Six people are dead.</i>

11:04.008 --> 11:06.527
Was that more or less
than you were hoping for?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.461
The number doesn't matter.

11:09.599 --> 11:11.256
How they suffer does.

11:11.394 --> 11:13.983
Walk with the wise
and become wise,

11:14.121 --> 11:17.849
for a companion of fools
suffers harm.

11:17.987 --> 11:21.542
Proverbs 13:20.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.924
I heard you were
riding Satan's tip,

11:24.062 --> 11:27.721
so why are you hiding
behind Bible quotes?

11:27.859 --> 11:30.068
If you know
the Old Testament,

11:30.206 --> 11:31.829
then you know that pain
and punishment

11:31.967 --> 11:34.694
lies at its heart,
the dark side

11:34.832 --> 11:37.213
of the Lord
personified in he

11:37.351 --> 11:38.594
who fell from heaven.

11:40.561 --> 11:42.529
Tell me more about the scene.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.256
You tell me more about it.

11:45.394 --> 11:47.016
Who orchestrated it?

11:47.154 --> 11:50.744
The who doesn't matter.
The how doesn't matter.

11:50.882 --> 11:54.334
There is no way that you
can stop what is coming.

11:54.472 --> 11:55.749
<i>What about the drone?</i>

11:55.887 --> 11:58.648
Any unique markings on it?
- It's a factory model.

11:58.787 --> 12:00.650
But the undercarriage
has been modified

12:00.789 --> 12:03.584
to hold a box
with a gas canister.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.104
Something that customized
could lead us to their maker.

12:06.242 --> 12:07.623
<i>I'll take it apart,</i>

12:07.761 --> 12:09.763
<i>but I'll need
to decontaminate it first.</i>

12:09.901 --> 12:11.800
There's something written
on the bottom.

12:11.938 --> 12:16.080
- What does it say?
<i>- "I am many."</i>

12:21.188 --> 12:23.812
You've got to push the button
if you want the ride, baby.

12:25.399 --> 12:27.056
Hm.

12:31.129 --> 12:34.167
Coming?
- I'll get the next one.

12:34.305 --> 12:36.963
Your loss.

12:37.101 --> 12:39.551
<i>♪ Taking all your breath
cause there's not much air ♪</i>

12:39.689 --> 12:42.451
<i>♪ Dominate, dominate, yeah</i>

12:42.589 --> 12:45.350
<i>♪ Dominate, dominate, yeah</i>

12:45.488 --> 12:48.112
<i>♪ If you bout to leave,
then you might get rocked ♪</i>

12:48.250 --> 12:50.700
<i>♪ Only one devil
left this room ♪</i>

12:50.839 --> 12:53.358
<i>♪ I'm feeling kind of crazed
on the last full moon ♪</i>

12:53.496 --> 12:56.499
<i>♪ There's a whole other prize
that I didn't take ♪</i>

12:56.637 --> 12:58.674
<i>♪ Bricks to the face
till I felt one break ♪</i>

12:58.812 --> 13:01.297
<i>♪ Dominate, dominate, yeah</i>

13:01.435 --> 13:04.300
<i>♪ If you bout to leave,
then you might get rocked ♪</i>

13:07.510 --> 13:08.718
<i>There was another attack.</i>

13:08.857 --> 13:10.203
<i>Four people were killed
in a Dallas elevator</i>

13:10.341 --> 13:12.032
<i>after it was rigged
to release a poisonous gas.</i>

13:12.170 --> 13:15.484
<i>"I am many" was spray painted
on the doors.</i>

13:15.622 --> 13:16.899
Do we know
who the victims are?

13:17.037 --> 13:18.487
Four venture capitalists
who were on their way back

13:18.625 --> 13:20.454
from celebrating
a corporate takeover.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.008
<i>No way our drone killer
could have gotten</i>

13:22.146 --> 13:23.492
from San Fran to Dallas in time

13:23.630 --> 13:25.183
to pull off
the elevator murders.

13:25.321 --> 13:26.667
<i>Which is why
we need to figure out</i>

13:26.806 --> 13:28.842
<i>how many there are
in "I am many."</i>

13:28.980 --> 13:30.706
So tell me you found something
actionable in San Francisco?

13:30.844 --> 13:32.673
<i>Not yet, but I'm
bringing the drone back</i>

13:32.812 --> 13:34.158
<i>to the lab to analyze it.</i>

13:34.296 --> 13:35.400
If we're lucky,
I'll be able to source

13:35.538 --> 13:37.299
a unique component
and ID a suspect.

13:37.437 --> 13:39.404
Hey, boss, has anyone
been able to figure out

13:39.542 --> 13:40.854
how Foster's
been communicating

13:40.992 --> 13:42.856
with his followers?
- Not yet, Brendon.

13:42.994 --> 13:44.409
All the guards on his watch
check out.

13:44.547 --> 13:46.826
His cell is being tossed
as we speak.

13:46.964 --> 13:50.484
They're not gonna stop
the execution, you know?

13:50.622 --> 13:53.694
So if you were gonna try
to leverage the murders--

13:53.833 --> 13:55.041
I'm not.

13:55.179 --> 13:57.181
No appeals have been filed,
no stays expected.

13:57.319 --> 14:01.702
I am running into
the embrace of the serpent

14:01.841 --> 14:05.396
on the crest of a tidal wave.
- Mm-hmm.

14:10.504 --> 14:12.127
Hey.

14:12.265 --> 14:13.783
What's all this nonsense
about our parents shacking up?

14:13.922 --> 14:15.958
I'm happy for them.
Aren't you?

14:16.096 --> 14:19.893
Yeah, I guess your pops knows
how to lock a good thing down.

14:20.031 --> 14:22.413
<i>Anyways, my mom wants us all
to have dinner tonight,</i>

14:22.551 --> 14:25.105
and I'm in if you are.
- Yeah, I--

14:25.243 --> 14:27.901
I'm out of town, and I
don't think I can make it.

14:28.039 --> 14:30.248
<i>Surprise.
Surprise.</i>

14:30.386 --> 14:32.423
<i>Dina, I got to go.</i>

14:32.561 --> 14:35.288
- Trouble at home?
- None of your business.

14:35.426 --> 14:36.910
You find anything?
- No.

14:37.048 --> 14:38.739
Cell's clean,
no contraband

14:38.878 --> 14:40.431
or communication devices
of any kind.

14:40.569 --> 14:42.882
You are clever--

14:43.020 --> 14:46.609
no visitors,
no incoming or outgoing mail.

14:46.747 --> 14:48.094
You don't talk
to other prisoners.

14:48.232 --> 14:49.889
You don't use the internet.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.857
Damn it.

15:00.037 --> 15:03.523
"The Birth of Corporate
Imperialism in a New World."

15:05.180 --> 15:07.147
If it was
my last night on Earth,

15:07.285 --> 15:10.219
I wouldn't be reading this.

15:10.357 --> 15:11.841
He read a lot?

15:11.980 --> 15:14.258
Oh, yeah,
two or three books a week.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.330
- I took the drone apart.
- Oh, hey.

15:17.468 --> 15:18.987
Every component
is standard except

15:19.125 --> 15:20.264
the gas disbursement ring.
- OK.

15:20.402 --> 15:22.300
Unfortunately,
it's a common item.

15:22.438 --> 15:24.164
Collecting sales records,
but the numbers

15:24.302 --> 15:25.648
are already in the hundreds.

15:25.786 --> 15:27.409
- OK.
- What's wrong?

15:27.547 --> 15:29.549
- Nothing.
- Liar.

15:31.275 --> 15:32.897
Remember that picture
from the gossip site

15:33.035 --> 15:35.520
where you look fabulous,

15:35.658 --> 15:36.936
and I look like
I'm desecrating a crab roll?

15:37.074 --> 15:38.592
Well, other media outlets
have picked it up,

15:38.730 --> 15:40.249
and now everyone wants to know
who "Vampire Cop's"

15:40.387 --> 15:44.012
mystery woman is.
- So let them wonder.

15:44.150 --> 15:46.566
No, no, that's not how
internet sleuths work.

15:46.704 --> 15:48.706
They don't wonder.

15:48.844 --> 15:51.157
They dig, and then they make up
all sorts of clickbait BS.

15:51.295 --> 15:53.021
Like what?

15:53.159 --> 15:55.851
This one says that you
were an ice hockey player,

15:55.989 --> 15:58.440
a star in France,
and this one says that you

15:58.578 --> 16:00.097
were, five years ago,
questioned over

16:00.235 --> 16:02.099
an art theft at the Louvre.

16:02.237 --> 16:05.723
- Those are both true.
- Wait, what?

16:05.861 --> 16:07.725
You never told me that.

16:07.863 --> 16:09.520
And I'm not going
to tell you now.

16:09.658 --> 16:11.280
I have work to do.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.043
<i>I don't get it.</i>

16:15.181 --> 16:16.182
These are all the books
that Foster

16:16.320 --> 16:18.046
has checked out
in the last year.

16:18.184 --> 16:19.806
None of them have
hollowed out pages

16:19.944 --> 16:21.014
for a burner cell.

16:21.152 --> 16:22.222
Nothing is written
in the margins.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.913
Well, it was worth a shot, huh?

16:24.052 --> 16:25.398
What are you doing
with my books?

16:25.536 --> 16:28.401
- You the prison librarian?
- Yeah, that's right.

16:28.539 --> 16:30.058
How would you like it
if I came in your house

16:30.196 --> 16:32.336
and messed it all up?
- Put 'em back.

16:32.474 --> 16:33.578
Hey, come on now!

16:37.134 --> 16:40.482
They're all messages
that have been blacked out.

16:40.620 --> 16:41.966
Yeah, there's another one.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.246
It's a numerical code.

16:46.384 --> 16:48.145
We need to decipher this
right away.

16:48.283 --> 16:50.906
Why don't we start
with the person

16:51.044 --> 16:53.529
who Foster was sending
the messages through.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.083
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:55.221 --> 16:56.739
Oh, you know
what we're talking about.

16:56.877 --> 16:58.534
You said these are your books.

17:03.229 --> 17:05.576
It doesn't matter
that you know.

17:05.714 --> 17:08.579
A tide is coming.

17:08.717 --> 17:10.753
I am many.

17:10.891 --> 17:12.272
- Wait--
- Oh!

17:12.410 --> 17:15.448
We need a medic!
Get a medic!

17:15.586 --> 17:17.277
Listen up.

17:17.415 --> 17:19.762
Foster was using a numeric code
hidden inside library books

17:19.900 --> 17:21.868
to send messages
through the prison librarian,

17:22.006 --> 17:23.111
Campbell Marsh.

17:23.249 --> 17:24.629
Do you think Campbell
will give up

17:24.767 --> 17:25.941
the other acolytes?
- No.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.115
When he was confronted,

17:27.253 --> 17:28.426
he cut his own carotid
and died,

17:28.564 --> 17:30.083
but the prison
sent us the names

17:30.221 --> 17:32.430
of every person that Campbell
met or communicated with.

17:32.568 --> 17:33.983
I'll cross-reference it
with the list

17:34.122 --> 17:36.469
of drone rig buyers
Antoinette gave us.

17:36.607 --> 17:38.298
Bingo, here we go--
Donald James.

17:38.436 --> 17:41.025
<i>All right,
Donald visited Campbell</i>

17:41.163 --> 17:42.613
in prison four occasions,

17:42.751 --> 17:44.442
<i>purchased drone components
ten days ago,</i>

17:44.580 --> 17:46.065
<i>and it looks like he just
flew back from San Francisco.</i>

17:49.206 --> 17:52.036
- I'm just getting home.
- Nice work.

17:52.174 --> 17:54.245
<i>You too.</i>

17:54.383 --> 17:56.799
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

17:56.937 --> 18:00.286
It's just--it's one thing
to plan these things.

18:00.424 --> 18:02.840
Maybe the gas was a mistake.

18:02.978 --> 18:05.084
It's just,
they died in such agony.

18:05.222 --> 18:06.395
Don't grieve the wicked.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.708
Something's wrong.

18:12.539 --> 18:15.991
FBI!
Drop it!

18:22.722 --> 18:24.137
Tell me you can salvage this?

18:24.275 --> 18:26.519
I could say yes,
but I'd be lying.

18:26.657 --> 18:28.348
We cracked the book code.

18:28.486 --> 18:31.834
Each set of numbers refer
to a page, a line, and a word.

18:31.972 --> 18:32.939
You put 'em together, Carter,

18:33.077 --> 18:34.458
and you get Foster's message.

18:34.596 --> 18:37.633
The book we recovered
is his final message

18:37.771 --> 18:39.325
to his followers.

18:39.463 --> 18:41.016
I'm almost afraid
to ask what he said.

18:43.018 --> 18:45.331
He said, "With the blood
of the wicked,

18:45.469 --> 18:46.780
"we shall save this world.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.956
From our deaths, come life.
I am many."

18:50.094 --> 18:51.716
<i>There's nothing there that
will help stop what's coming.</i>

18:51.854 --> 18:53.511
No.
How's it going with Mr. James?

18:53.649 --> 18:54.995
Nothing so far.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.205
<i>We know you're responsible
for the drone attack</i>

18:57.343 --> 18:58.654
<i>in San Francisco.</i>

18:58.792 --> 19:01.209
We know you supplied
the same gas to another one

19:01.347 --> 19:03.280
of Foster's minions in Dallas.

19:03.418 --> 19:06.904
So who else did you supply
the hydrogen cyanide to?

19:07.042 --> 19:09.044
<i>Carter, we need
this guy to roll over.</i>

19:09.182 --> 19:11.288
<i>You know that.</i>

19:11.426 --> 19:13.048
Come on, Donald.

19:14.877 --> 19:17.397
No.
Stop him!

19:17.535 --> 19:19.572
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

19:22.437 --> 19:24.059
Cyanide eyewear.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.234
That's it.
I've seen it all.

19:26.372 --> 19:28.236
I was the ranking agent, man.
This is on me.

19:28.374 --> 19:30.065
No, we were the ones
in there.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.584
I am not looking
to assign blame.

19:31.722 --> 19:34.034
Protocols are that we search
suspects for weapons,

19:34.173 --> 19:35.760
not suicide pills.
I mean, come on.

19:35.898 --> 19:37.417
Who the hell are these people?

19:37.555 --> 19:39.074
True believers,

19:39.212 --> 19:41.076
people who will kill
without remorse,

19:41.214 --> 19:42.940
will die for a cause.

19:43.078 --> 19:45.184
I mean, remember
Foster's last message.

19:45.322 --> 19:47.945
"From our deaths come life."
- OK.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.602
Someone, please,
give me some good news.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.776
We recovered
Donald James's computer.

19:51.914 --> 19:53.502
Tech team is scrubbing it now.

19:53.640 --> 19:54.986
Yeah, odds are
it contains intel

19:55.124 --> 19:56.264
from the other attacks.

19:56.402 --> 19:57.575
All right,
everyone grab their favorite

19:57.713 --> 19:59.059
caffeinated drink
'cause as long as the clock

19:59.198 --> 20:00.716
is ticking, so are we.

20:00.854 --> 20:04.030
Hey, boss, mind if I run home
and change clothes?

20:04.168 --> 20:06.274
These reek of death row.

20:06.412 --> 20:07.758
Of course, you've had a day.
You know what?

20:07.896 --> 20:09.380
Take the night, decompress.
- No, no, no.

20:09.518 --> 20:11.382
I can come right--
- Simone, take the night.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.728
That's an order.

20:12.866 --> 20:14.420
I'll be in the lab
if anyone needs me.

20:14.558 --> 20:17.457
Oh, no, actually,
can I talk to you for a sec?

20:17.595 --> 20:19.597
You remember I told you
that my biggest regret in life

20:19.735 --> 20:21.047
was turning down
that hockey scholarship

20:21.185 --> 20:22.393
to play at Penn State?

20:22.531 --> 20:23.946
To star in
the direct-to-video sequel

20:24.084 --> 20:25.914
of "The Hottie the Nottie."

20:26.052 --> 20:27.571
Yes, you mentioned that.
- Right, OK.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.400
So you never saw that
as an opportunity

20:29.538 --> 20:34.474
to like--maybe a cue to tell me
that you also play hockey? No?

20:34.612 --> 20:37.477
<i>Mon amour,</i> you know
I relish in being enigmatic.

20:37.615 --> 20:39.548
Yeah.

20:39.686 --> 20:41.274
But, yes, back in Lissy,

20:41.412 --> 20:42.793
I was considered
the best goalie

20:42.931 --> 20:45.105
in the Ile-de-France.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.038
Oh, you're a goalie?

20:47.176 --> 20:49.972
There's players and goalies.

20:50.110 --> 20:52.147
It's like a different thing.
It's OK.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.562
Don't let
the lab coat fool you.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.737
- OK.
- Name the time and the place.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.912
I will destroy you.
- Can't wait.

20:59.050 --> 21:04.953
Also, this--
this art theft thing.

21:05.091 --> 21:08.025
You were questioned, right?

21:08.163 --> 21:09.992
Yes, but only because
my boyfriend,

21:10.130 --> 21:11.994
René, was an
international art thief.

21:12.132 --> 21:16.344
Really?
And you didn't know anything?

21:16.482 --> 21:18.518
- Mm.
- What?

21:18.656 --> 21:20.037
No.

21:20.175 --> 21:22.350
But he was
a very unpredictable man

21:22.488 --> 21:27.044
with an aura of danger
that was quite sexy.

21:27.182 --> 21:29.529
Then one night,
he tried to steal

21:29.667 --> 21:32.808
a Caravaggio from the Louvre
and was caught.

21:32.946 --> 21:38.297
René always was very ambitious.
- God.

21:38.435 --> 21:39.608
And I have work to do,
so you need to leave.

21:39.746 --> 21:41.369
Out, out, out, out.
- Fine.

21:41.507 --> 21:45.304
<i>God's children have become
slaves to the rich.</i>

21:45.442 --> 21:47.720
<i>You claim righteousness
but recently wrote</i>

21:47.858 --> 21:50.067
<i>a treatise celebrating Satan.</i>

21:50.205 --> 21:52.828
<i>You make that sound
like it's a bad thing.</i>

21:52.966 --> 21:56.073
<i>Satan was God's
favorite angel.</i>

21:56.211 --> 22:01.458
<i>He named him Morning Star,
blameless and always full</i>

22:01.596 --> 22:05.531
<i>in wisdom, perfect in beauty.</i>

22:05.669 --> 22:08.085
- You building a profile?
- Yeah.

22:08.223 --> 22:10.259
This guy is full
of contradictions,

22:10.398 --> 22:12.054
reinterpreting
the scripture to fit

22:12.192 --> 22:15.264
his twisted need to murder.
You know what's nagging me?

22:15.403 --> 22:18.095
It's the "why now" of all this.
- What do you mean?

22:18.233 --> 22:20.442
Well, Foster's been
in prison for 18 years,

22:20.580 --> 22:22.755
and now, all of a sudden,
he has followers?

22:22.893 --> 22:24.860
How did he get them?

22:24.998 --> 22:27.207
The only contact
he's had with the outside world

22:27.346 --> 22:28.933
is this interview
he did two years ago.

22:29.071 --> 22:31.246
OK.
So what are you thinking?

22:31.384 --> 22:33.110
He's using this interview as
some kind of recruitment tool?

22:33.248 --> 22:36.009
- Just--
<i>- Read your Bible.</i>

22:36.147 --> 22:41.083
<i>The answers lie
in 1 John 5:19.</i>

22:41.221 --> 22:44.639
<i>"We are certain
we come from God,</i>

22:44.777 --> 22:48.712
<i>and the rest of the world
is under the power of Satan."</i>

22:48.850 --> 22:50.610
<i>And that's of significance,
why?</i>

22:50.748 --> 22:54.511
<i>Because even
the Almighty knew</i>

22:54.649 --> 22:56.616
<i>that sometimes,</i>

22:56.754 --> 23:00.275
<i>you need to send the devil
to do God's work.</i>

23:00.413 --> 23:01.897
Have a thing
with these bears,

23:02.035 --> 23:03.623
and it just grew hairs.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.801
- That was good.
- Oh, yeah.

23:08.939 --> 23:11.459
Whew, finally, you are here.

23:11.597 --> 23:14.807
Yeah.
Sorry I'm late.

23:14.945 --> 23:16.912
I forgot we were
getting together tonight.

23:17.050 --> 23:19.259
So you late for a dinner
you forgot about?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.469
Honey, she's here now.
That's all that matters.

23:21.607 --> 23:25.990
OK, so we wanted
the four of us to get together

23:26.128 --> 23:28.303
so we could clear the air.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.581
As you girls know,
Cutty and I

23:30.719 --> 23:31.996
have gotten pretty serious.

23:32.134 --> 23:35.828
And we will not
allow our daughters'

23:35.966 --> 23:39.935
messy split to upset that.
- I wouldn't call it messy.

23:40.073 --> 23:42.179
- I would.
- I told you.

23:42.317 --> 23:44.250
My daughter is in denial.
- Mm-hmm.

23:44.388 --> 23:45.769
And mine's brooding.
- True.

23:45.907 --> 23:46.873
Ready to go?

23:47.011 --> 23:49.358
- Hey, yep.
- Well, wait a minute.

23:49.497 --> 23:52.154
I thought we were having dinner
together tonight.

23:52.292 --> 23:56.331
That's what you might call
falling for the okey-doke

23:56.469 --> 23:59.127
Ruth and I
are going out to dinner.

23:59.265 --> 24:02.164
While you two stay here
until you work it out.

24:02.302 --> 24:04.201
Understood?
- Mm-hmm.

24:04.339 --> 24:05.961
- Mm-hmm.
- You ready, darling?

24:06.099 --> 24:08.412
Oh, yes. Oh.

24:08.550 --> 24:10.828
Have a good night.

24:10.966 --> 24:14.176
And don't wait up for us.

24:14.314 --> 24:15.868
We just got
straight-up conned.

24:16.006 --> 24:18.318
Straight up.

24:19.975 --> 24:21.874
You OK?

24:22.012 --> 24:23.634
You look like
you've been through it.

24:23.772 --> 24:25.981
And then some.

24:26.119 --> 24:28.708
It's good to see you.

24:28.846 --> 24:30.710
You too.

24:35.163 --> 24:40.306
I wish things had ended
differently between us.

24:40.444 --> 24:42.722
They still can.

24:50.592 --> 24:52.387
We doing this?

25:08.196 --> 25:10.439
Daddy?

25:12.856 --> 25:14.685
Daddy?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.900
I am many.

25:25.385 --> 25:29.597
- What is it?
- I got to go back to Idaho.

25:29.735 --> 25:34.533
- What's in Idaho?
- The devil.

25:40.090 --> 25:41.850
This energy drink
is gonna keep me up for weeks.

25:41.988 --> 25:43.265
My teeth are vibrating.

25:43.403 --> 25:45.026
Did Antoinette really lead
the women's rowing team

25:45.164 --> 25:47.511
at Oxford?
- I don't know, probably.

25:47.649 --> 25:49.617
Oh.
Trouble in paradise?

25:49.755 --> 25:50.756
No, it's just--you know,

25:50.894 --> 25:52.205
I thought
we were getting close,

25:52.343 --> 25:53.759
and I'm just finding out
all this wild stuff about her

25:53.897 --> 25:54.967
that she didn't tell me.
- OK.

25:55.105 --> 25:56.451
Well, you had
a life before her too.

25:56.589 --> 25:57.970
I know,
but I'm not finding out

25:58.108 --> 25:59.419
that she likes cream
in her coffee.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.938
I'm finding out she dated
an international art thief,

26:01.076 --> 26:02.319
things like that.

26:02.457 --> 26:04.286
Yeah, but that René guy
was oof.

26:04.424 --> 26:05.736
- Don't need that.
- OK.

26:05.874 --> 26:07.600
She is a woman of mystery.

26:07.738 --> 26:09.326
It's what attracted you
to her in the first place.

26:09.464 --> 26:11.880
So instead of getting jealous,
level up.

26:12.018 --> 26:15.159
Be that for her.
Be unpredictable, unexpected.

26:15.297 --> 26:17.645
OK.
Level up, got it.

26:17.783 --> 26:19.508
We got something
from Donald James's computer.

26:19.647 --> 26:21.545
He was communicating
to Foster's acolytes

26:21.683 --> 26:22.995
through a dark web
message board.

26:23.133 --> 26:24.479
Can we track the messages?

26:24.617 --> 26:26.170
It's encrypted, and we
don't have the password.

26:26.308 --> 26:27.655
Tech team's trying to crack it.

26:27.793 --> 26:29.070
Yeah,
but that could take days.

26:29.208 --> 26:30.692
We only have hours,
and these attacks

26:30.830 --> 26:33.143
are only going to ramp up until
Foster's execution tonight.

26:33.281 --> 26:34.938
OK, let's look at this
a different way.

26:35.076 --> 26:37.285
How did the acolytes
get the dark web address

26:37.423 --> 26:39.114
in the first place
and the password to get in?

26:39.252 --> 26:41.289
Someone had
to have led them there.

26:41.427 --> 26:43.636
Foster.
Foster did it in his interview.

26:43.774 --> 26:46.087
Yeah, Foster Mills was just
another faceless killer

26:46.225 --> 26:48.917
rotting away in prison
until he got his execution date

26:49.055 --> 26:50.678
and a televised platform.

26:50.816 --> 26:52.196
He could have used that
to light the fuse.

26:52.334 --> 26:54.509
Foster's original letters
always spoke in ciphers.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.925
The library books were in code.

26:57.063 --> 26:59.307
Embedding a message
in his interview fits his MO.

26:59.445 --> 27:01.102
Let's rewatch that video,
and let's find

27:01.240 --> 27:02.379
the clues in his words.

27:02.517 --> 27:04.830
Go. Go. Go.

27:04.968 --> 27:07.695
Simone, where are you?
- Somewhere over Nevada?

27:07.833 --> 27:09.144
Excuse me?

27:09.282 --> 27:11.146
What's the thing
about asking for forgiveness

27:11.284 --> 27:12.838
instead of permission?

27:12.976 --> 27:15.185
Yeah, it's how you've led
your entire life, Simone.

27:15.323 --> 27:18.291
Boss, Foster Mills
got in my head.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.535
And now I think
I can get into his.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.193
These cult leaders, they--
they drone on and on

27:23.331 --> 27:24.815
about a higher purpose.

27:24.953 --> 27:26.852
<i>But really, they're just
using other people</i>

27:26.990 --> 27:29.302
<i>to do what they can't
or won't do.</i>

27:29.440 --> 27:31.028
<i>They're weak.</i>
- OK.

27:31.166 --> 27:32.651
So what's your gambit?

27:32.789 --> 27:34.066
You're going to go back at him
with strength,

27:34.204 --> 27:35.550
put him on the defense.
Is that it?

27:35.688 --> 27:36.689
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:36.827 --> 27:38.691
And hope I can
get something out of him

27:38.829 --> 27:40.555
to stop this next attack
he's planning.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.074
OK.
That's fine.

27:42.212 --> 27:43.938
Hey, listen, Simone,
you didn't have to hijack

27:44.076 --> 27:46.492
the plane in order to do this.
You could have just asked me.

27:46.630 --> 27:49.529
- You mad?
- Not if we save some lives.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.669
Go.

28:01.438 --> 28:04.821
Last day on Earth.

28:04.959 --> 28:07.271
How'd you sleep?

28:07.409 --> 28:09.308
Better than you, I think.

28:09.446 --> 28:10.999
Maybe.

28:11.137 --> 28:12.760
But only one of us
gets a chance

28:12.898 --> 28:14.589
to try it again tonight.

28:14.727 --> 28:16.695
Maybe.

28:16.833 --> 28:21.251
And maybe today's carnage
will keep you from sleeping

28:21.389 --> 28:23.080
peacefully ever again.

28:23.218 --> 28:25.945
I hate to be the one
to tell you, boo,

28:26.083 --> 28:29.811
but you're deep in
the lost column this morning.

28:29.949 --> 28:34.989
Campbell and Donald gave up,
and then they gave you up.

28:35.127 --> 28:36.784
Lies.

28:36.922 --> 28:38.924
We're gonna be out
scooping up

28:39.062 --> 28:44.205
the rest of your
wretched refuse in a few.

28:44.343 --> 28:47.898
And with 12 hours left,
do you want to leave

28:48.036 --> 28:51.281
your legacy up to those two?

28:51.419 --> 28:53.870
Or do you want
to come clean with me?

28:54.008 --> 28:55.388
<i>Read your Bible.</i>

28:55.526 --> 28:59.047
<i>The answers lie
in 1 John 5:19.</i>

28:59.185 --> 29:01.567
<i>"We are certain
we come from God,</i>

29:01.705 --> 29:06.468
<i>and the rest of the world
is under the power of Satan."</i>

29:06.606 --> 29:08.125
That has to be code
of some kind.

29:08.263 --> 29:11.819
Yeah, well, if you do a
simple alphanumeric conversion

29:11.957 --> 29:14.166
of 1 John 5:19,
it's the address

29:14.304 --> 29:16.168
of Foster's dark website.
- OK.

29:16.306 --> 29:18.584
So we're on the right track.
We just need a password.

29:18.722 --> 29:21.138
Is it one of the words
from scripture that he quoted?

29:21.276 --> 29:25.108
He said, "the answers lie
in 1 John 5:19."

29:27.558 --> 29:31.010
Try typing in "Satan."
- OK.

29:31.148 --> 29:32.805
Nope, that's not it.
- Maybe it is.

29:32.943 --> 29:34.427
Change the language.

29:34.565 --> 29:37.120
Go to the original Greek
the scripture was written in.

29:39.674 --> 29:40.675
Oh, my God.
We're in.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.366
They're mobilizing.

29:42.504 --> 29:44.990
Multiple simultaneous attacks
in Kansas City, Baltimore--

29:45.128 --> 29:47.682
Chicago, Miami,
all set for this morning.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.373
It's Carter.

29:49.511 --> 29:50.547
I need emergency authorization...

29:50.685 --> 29:51.962
OK, let's get HRT ramping up.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.861
- For a nationwide operation.
- Yep, in Kansas City.

29:53.999 --> 29:56.380
Authorization to follow.

29:59.590 --> 30:00.971
Kansas City field office
just arrested

30:01.109 --> 30:02.835
two suspects
about to gas a law firm

30:02.973 --> 30:04.630
that represents big tobacco.

30:04.768 --> 30:07.564
We have arrests in Chicago
and Miami, two more down.

30:07.702 --> 30:09.669
Baltimore PD is conducting
a raid as we speak.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.016
Patching us in now.

30:13.121 --> 30:14.226
Hands down!

30:14.364 --> 30:16.228
<i>Let me see--
- Suspect in custody.</i>

30:16.366 --> 30:18.333
<i>Hydrogen cyanide secure.</i>
- That's it.

30:18.471 --> 30:19.956
All attacks have been thwarted.

30:20.094 --> 30:22.337
Good work, people.

30:22.475 --> 30:23.891
- Yeah!
- Quiet.

30:24.029 --> 30:25.547
Quiet, everyone, quiet.

30:25.685 --> 30:27.722
Someone just logged in to
the Los Angeles message board.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.690
"The righteous will rejoice
when he sees the vengeance.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.728
"He will wash his feet
in the blood of the wicked.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.179
I am many."

30:54.680 --> 30:58.373
You cannot believe
the snake oil you're selling.

30:58.511 --> 31:01.100
Foster, you're a smart man,

31:01.238 --> 31:04.276
despite your psychopathy.

31:04.414 --> 31:07.451
Everyone deserves to feel
like their life has purpose,

31:07.589 --> 31:09.729
especially at the end.

31:09.868 --> 31:14.734
And what greater purpose
than to lead a crusade

31:14.873 --> 31:16.875
against the evils of wealth?

31:17.013 --> 31:19.429
Because even
a four-year-old knows

31:19.567 --> 31:22.984
that two wrongs
don't make a right.

31:23.122 --> 31:25.262
<i>Simone, we stopped all of
Foster's acolytes except one.</i>

31:25.400 --> 31:27.402
<i>They're in LA, and I need you
to get us something</i>

31:27.540 --> 31:30.095
<i>before it's too late.</i>

31:30.233 --> 31:33.408
People like you
are all the same.

31:38.241 --> 31:41.416
People like me?

31:42.901 --> 31:45.489
No one is like me.

31:45.627 --> 31:49.217
I mean, please, I see
at least two of you a week

31:49.355 --> 31:51.495
on this job.

31:51.633 --> 31:55.810
Uh, truth becomes lies.
Evil becomes good.

31:55.948 --> 31:58.709
Even in your defeat,
you claim victory.

31:58.847 --> 31:59.952
Why?

32:00.090 --> 32:01.954
Because with all these words,

32:02.092 --> 32:05.095
you're just a scared little man

32:05.233 --> 32:07.615
who's standing on his ego.

32:07.753 --> 32:08.892
No, no, no, no.

32:09.030 --> 32:12.068
You--you mind
who you're dealing with.

32:12.206 --> 32:16.279
I--I have snatched the life
from the wretched.

32:16.417 --> 32:19.627
I've led an army
from captivity.

32:19.765 --> 32:21.974
I'm not afraid.

32:22.112 --> 32:23.942
I am many!
- Ha!

32:24.080 --> 32:27.807
You are a clown,
who can't even be honest

32:27.946 --> 32:31.708
about what drives him.
What drives you, Foster?

32:31.846 --> 32:34.849
It is simple
and has never wavered--

32:34.987 --> 32:37.956
I will see before I die,

32:38.094 --> 32:42.305
the slate wiped clean!

32:42.443 --> 32:45.687
Those who have sinned
must be punished.

32:45.825 --> 32:51.797
And those who defy me
will be executed!

32:51.935 --> 32:54.179
Even from the grave!

32:54.317 --> 32:57.182
- Got him.
<i>- OK.</i>

32:57.320 --> 32:59.184
Tell me you got something?
<i>- Hear me out.</i>

32:59.322 --> 33:01.289
<i>This last attack is personal.</i>

33:01.427 --> 33:03.740
<i>I got him pissed off,
and he said,</i>

33:03.878 --> 33:06.225
<i>"Those who defy me
will be punished</i>

33:06.363 --> 33:08.020
<i>and the slate
will be wiped clean."</i>

33:08.158 --> 33:10.057
Our last acolyte's message
talked about vengeance.

33:10.195 --> 33:12.197
Yeah, and cult leaders
like Foster

33:12.335 --> 33:14.337
are obsessed with their legacy.
- OK.

33:14.475 --> 33:15.924
Well, he's on death row

33:16.063 --> 33:17.236
because 18 years ago,
Foster sent out

33:17.374 --> 33:18.720
three letters filled
with anthrax.

33:18.858 --> 33:20.550
But only two of them
hit his intended targets.

33:20.688 --> 33:22.310
One of them was a miss.
It was a woman.

33:22.448 --> 33:25.313
She was a CEO of a bank that
foreclosed on Foster's home.

33:25.451 --> 33:27.384
What was her name?

33:27.522 --> 33:29.835
I got it.
Renata Schmidt.

33:29.973 --> 33:33.183
Renata Schmidt.
Find her.

33:38.568 --> 33:41.605
Fresh towel, ma'am?

33:46.886 --> 33:48.923
- Mrs. Schmidt?
- Yes.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.718
We received an urgent call
from your office.

33:50.856 --> 33:52.685
They said you need
to call them back immediately.

34:09.012 --> 34:11.221
This better be important.

34:11.359 --> 34:13.292
Slow down.
What?

34:13.430 --> 34:14.811
Patch him through.

34:14.949 --> 34:17.158
The Special Agent
Laura Stensen with the FBI.

34:17.296 --> 34:18.953
We have reason to believe
someone is trying to kill you.

34:19.091 --> 34:20.403
We'll be right there,
but we need you

34:20.541 --> 34:21.714
to leave the spa right now.

34:21.852 --> 34:23.440
Go to the lobby.
Do you understand?

34:23.578 --> 34:25.580
Yes, I'll leave now.

35:23.638 --> 35:25.157
Blood.

35:33.855 --> 35:37.135
You've hidden your sins
long enough, Renata.

35:37.273 --> 35:38.653
Come out!

35:41.000 --> 35:42.519
No!

35:42.657 --> 35:45.177
FBI!
Put your hands up!

35:56.361 --> 35:57.983
Hey!
Hey!

35:58.121 --> 35:59.847
On your stomach.

35:59.985 --> 36:01.228
We need
an ambulance here now!

36:01.366 --> 36:03.402
Lay down.

36:03.540 --> 36:06.025
We saved Renata.

36:11.548 --> 36:15.242
The many are now the none.

36:15.380 --> 36:18.037
All of your people
are in custody.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.868
So you can go
to your death knowing

36:21.006 --> 36:24.492
that this perverted movement
dies with you.

36:24.630 --> 36:27.426
No.

36:27.564 --> 36:30.947
My death will serve to inspire.

36:31.085 --> 36:33.260
OK,
that's where I'ma stop you.

36:33.398 --> 36:37.436
I don't have to listen
to your BS anymore.

36:37.574 --> 36:40.128
Enjoy your last meal.

36:40.267 --> 36:42.545
And may God have mercy
on your soul.

36:48.067 --> 36:49.448
Foster Mills
was officially put

36:49.586 --> 36:51.726
to death at 10:07 p.m. tonight.

36:51.864 --> 36:54.971
Hopefully this messed-up
movement died with him.

36:55.109 --> 36:57.111
Unless it backfired
and he gets more attention now,

36:57.249 --> 36:58.595
letting him be propped up
as a martyr.

36:58.733 --> 37:00.735
In my experience
profiling cults,

37:00.873 --> 37:02.081
movements quickly fizzle

37:02.220 --> 37:04.808
without the leader's
constant presence and sway.

37:04.946 --> 37:07.708
Without that magnetic pull,
followers usually drift back

37:07.846 --> 37:09.641
into their normal lives.

37:09.779 --> 37:11.436
Either way, Laura,

37:11.574 --> 37:13.369
we'll be waiting
and ready for them.

37:21.308 --> 37:25.760
<i>♪ Way down in my heart
is where you're bound to be ♪</i>

37:25.898 --> 37:30.282
<i>♪ My soul is on fire
'cause you bring me ♪</i>

37:30.420 --> 37:32.767
<i>♪ There ain't no love</i>

37:32.905 --> 37:35.114
Uh, hi.

37:35.253 --> 37:40.085
So, listen, I know
you relish in being a mystery.

37:40.223 --> 37:43.261
But my joy comes from
learning everything

37:43.399 --> 37:45.849
there is to know about you.

37:45.987 --> 37:48.335
So what are you proposing?

37:48.473 --> 37:49.819
A competition.

37:49.957 --> 37:52.822
- You want us to play hockey?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

37:52.960 --> 37:56.860
Except not for goals,
for facts.

37:56.998 --> 38:00.139
So every time I score,
which I will constantly,

38:00.278 --> 38:01.831
you need to tell me something
about yourself

38:01.969 --> 38:03.177
that you never told me,

38:03.315 --> 38:06.525
something--something juicy.

38:06.663 --> 38:10.011
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, yeah, I'm serious.

38:10.149 --> 38:13.429
Is the best goalie
on Ile-de-France

38:13.567 --> 38:16.535
a little bit scared?

38:16.673 --> 38:20.505
Game on.

38:22.645 --> 38:25.820
Hey, goalie, is it hard to do
your hair with your bad hands?

38:27.995 --> 38:31.170
All right, jeez.
I'm--I'm just warming up.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.000
<i>♪ Ease your mind</i>

38:33.138 --> 38:37.487
<i>♪ It's more than enough
to know that you are mine ♪</i>

38:37.625 --> 38:38.868
I'm sorry.

38:39.006 --> 38:40.352
Didn't you say
you were good at this?

38:40.490 --> 38:43.562
Put your helmet back on.
You ready?

38:43.700 --> 38:48.567
<i>♪ Cause I ain't
ever letting you go ♪</i>

38:48.705 --> 38:50.155
Unbelievable.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.713
How about this?

38:56.851 --> 38:59.095
I'll give you one point
for being creative,

38:59.233 --> 39:01.856
and one point
for being unpredictable,

39:01.994 --> 39:05.688
and one point for being
really cute right now

39:05.826 --> 39:07.759
even though
I'm kicking your ass.

39:07.897 --> 39:09.761
- Gee, thanks.
- OK.

39:09.899 --> 39:14.662
So one fun fact about me...

39:14.800 --> 39:17.596
If you look closely,
you can find me

39:17.734 --> 39:19.667
strutting by the camera
in Bruno Mars'

39:19.805 --> 39:21.842
"Uptown Funk" video.

39:21.980 --> 39:23.602
You don't ever see my face,

39:23.740 --> 39:27.537
but if you know my legs,
which you do...

39:27.675 --> 39:30.540
- I do.
- Then you'll know it's me.

39:30.678 --> 39:34.717
Want to see?
- Yeah.

39:37.892 --> 39:39.377
Oh, my God.
Yeah, that's it.

39:39.515 --> 39:43.450
That's the move.

39:43.588 --> 39:46.694
Hey, looks like
the party is in here.

39:46.832 --> 39:48.972
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, Dina.

39:49.110 --> 39:51.975
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

39:52.113 --> 39:54.461
It's so wonderful
to see our girls being

39:54.599 --> 39:56.808
so friendly to each other.
- Mm-hmm.

39:56.946 --> 39:58.603
Oh, we have
some important news.

39:58.741 --> 40:00.467
We had a long heart to heart.

40:00.605 --> 40:03.435
And we decided
not to move in together.

40:03.573 --> 40:05.644
- Well, what happened?
- Oh, no, no, nothing.

40:05.782 --> 40:08.958
I mean, we still
crazy about each other.

40:09.096 --> 40:11.616
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

40:11.754 --> 40:16.137
So why rush to fix something
that is not broken?

40:16.275 --> 40:18.243
We just like our own space.

40:18.381 --> 40:21.004
And someone gets a big kick

40:21.142 --> 40:22.972
out of sneaking in
and surprising the other.

40:23.110 --> 40:24.491
- Someone, huh?
- Yeah, someone.

40:24.629 --> 40:27.321
Girl, you know you love it.
Boo-wah.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.254
Now, only it's
a full moon tonight.

40:29.392 --> 40:32.153
Shall we enjoy our dessert
on the patio?

40:32.291 --> 40:35.433
- Oh, lead the way, my queen.
- Oh, my king.

40:35.571 --> 40:37.227
- Come on.
- Whoa.

40:39.229 --> 40:40.817
Hey, come on now.

40:40.955 --> 40:43.026
It's pie o'clock.

40:43.164 --> 40:44.511
Give us just one second, Daddy.

40:44.649 --> 40:46.271
We'll be right there.

40:46.409 --> 40:47.617
Wow, those two--

40:47.755 --> 40:49.861
I mean,
like teenagers, right?

40:49.999 --> 40:55.625
Um, look, Dina, when we
first started hooking up,

40:55.763 --> 40:59.491
I was working overtime to prove
that I belonged in the FBI.

40:59.629 --> 41:02.667
I didn't have time
in my life for anyone,

41:02.805 --> 41:05.014
but now, I think what I need
is balance

41:05.152 --> 41:09.294
to live my best life,
and last night was incredible.

41:09.432 --> 41:10.985
Yeah?

41:11.123 --> 41:12.297
And I don't think
it was a mistake.

41:12.435 --> 41:15.852
I don't think so either.

41:15.990 --> 41:17.682
For the record,
I think that's how

41:17.820 --> 41:20.719
we should have gotten closure
the first time.

41:20.857 --> 41:23.066
But?

41:23.204 --> 41:26.380
But what I think
you need more now

41:26.518 --> 41:29.038
than a lover is a friend.

41:29.176 --> 41:32.524
Could I have
a friend with benefits?

41:32.662 --> 41:35.493
All of the fun
and none of the drama?

41:35.631 --> 41:38.357
- No breakups.
- No breakup.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.878
And you know the thing
that you said about closure?

41:42.016 --> 41:43.259
Mm.

41:43.397 --> 41:45.572
I could use
a little closure right now.

41:45.710 --> 41:47.056
How about you?

41:47.194 --> 41:50.197
<i>Ladies,
