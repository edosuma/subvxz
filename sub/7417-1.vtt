WEBVTT

01:19.726 --> 01:22.044
Out of the darkness

01:23.125 --> 01:25.053
Something is waiting.

01:27.513 --> 01:31.828
Something you must overcome

01:33.403 --> 01:38.398
No time for weakness or hesitating

01:41.968 --> 01:45.745
This time it's got to be done

01:47.867 --> 01:49.804
Tales of power

01:50.956 --> 01:53.333
Tales of power

01:54.650 --> 01:58.206
Tales of power all around you

01:58.410 --> 02:01.048
Into the void you've been hurled

02:01.042 --> 02:05.428
Tales of power will surround you

02:05.428 --> 02:10.103
Now is the hour for
you to stop the world

02:13.940 --> 02:17.505
- Sammy, how you doing?

02:17.961 --> 02:20.009
- Hey guy, where you been?

02:20.517 --> 02:21.816
Say, why don't you wait outside and we'll

02:21.818 --> 02:23.226
go out for a couple of beers?

02:23.224 --> 02:24.902
- I can't, Sam, I gotta pick up Walter.

02:24.896 --> 02:26.754
- How is my godson?

02:26.761 --> 02:30.188
- Walter's great, Walter is always great.

02:37.289 --> 02:38.507
Are you ready for this?

02:38.503 --> 02:39.493
- Yeah.

02:41.543 --> 02:42.821
- Are you holding on?

02:42.819 --> 02:44.367
- Yeah, are you holding on?

02:44.375 --> 02:45.633
- I got you, Walter.

02:45.631 --> 02:47.459
I'm right here.

02:48.349 --> 02:49.788
Keep peddling.

02:49.788 --> 02:51.405
Keep peddling.

02:51.854 --> 02:54.202
Okay, Walter, you're on your own.

02:54.199 --> 02:55.648
You got it?

02:55.701 --> 02:57.160
- Dad.

02:58.141 --> 02:59.690
Look, I'm doing it!

02:59.686 --> 03:01.554
- Attaboy, Walter, you got it.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.239
- I'm riding alone.

03:03.245 --> 03:05.972
- I know, I know!

03:08.317 --> 03:09.566
- Whoa!

03:16.601 --> 03:17.941
- Four.

03:18.539 --> 03:19.797
- Get serious.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.198
Five.

03:21.624 --> 03:23.403
Six.

03:32.107 --> 03:34.865
You guys, stop, stop, stop.

03:35.517 --> 03:36.945
I said stop, stop.

03:36.952 --> 03:38.480
I said stop.

03:39.589 --> 03:40.888
- He started it.

03:40.884 --> 03:43.152
- Stop it, I said break it up.

03:43.549 --> 03:45.626
Now what do I teach you guys?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.960
- To be nice to people.

03:47.959 --> 03:49.877
- Yes, and?

03:49.877 --> 03:53.204
- Not to use what you
teach us to hurt people.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.500
- Good.

03:55.923 --> 03:58.380
So do you guys want to
beat each others' face in

03:58.378 --> 04:01.354
or do you want to shake
hands and be friends?

04:01.351 --> 04:02.999
- Friends.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.280
- Okay, I want you to be
best of friends, understand?

04:08.308 --> 04:09.507
- Yes sir.

04:09.609 --> 04:11.088
- All right, let's continue.

04:11.090 --> 04:12.848
Left and reverse punch one.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.053
- Mr. Lee.

04:21.079 --> 04:23.438
Excuse me, I think you should see this.

04:23.443 --> 04:24.622
- Everybody.

04:24.625 --> 04:26.224
Elliot, take over.

04:40.936 --> 04:43.304
- Ma, I've been asked to try out for the

04:43.302 --> 04:45.690
US National Karate Team.

04:45.976 --> 04:46.845
- Can I see it?

04:46.850 --> 04:47.899
- Yeah.

04:52.445 --> 04:54.963
- Are you seriously considering this?

04:55.651 --> 04:57.899
Don't they know about your shoulder?

04:58.017 --> 04:59.816
- Ma, my shoulder's all right.

04:59.818 --> 05:02.835
- Yeah, if you call plastic
cartilage in a steel pin

05:02.833 --> 05:04.551
all right, it's all right.

05:05.398 --> 05:07.246
Your shoulder's junk.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.528
What happens if you get hurt again?

05:10.521 --> 05:12.279
You could be paralyzed or something.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.718
- Calm down.

05:15.485 --> 05:18.153
Mama, I got nothing here.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.599
Nothing.

05:20.570 --> 05:24.156
Competing was the only
thing that made me feel...

05:25.577 --> 05:27.355
You saw me.

05:28.614 --> 05:30.791
- Yeah, I saw you.

05:33.046 --> 05:34.954
- Dad, I'm in bed.

05:36.786 --> 05:39.214
- And Walter, he's only five years old.

05:39.216 --> 05:40.754
He needs his father at home.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.319
What about your son?

05:42.327 --> 05:44.416
- What about my son?

05:45.897 --> 05:50.132
Mama, I love you.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.173
Walter and I will work it out, okay?

05:57.170 --> 06:01.915
And they were both wounded,
but they would not stop.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.761
Lancelot and Arthur
battled for a full day,

06:04.757 --> 06:07.864
finally defeating the evil Mordred.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.735
And the kingdom rejoiced
as they rode through

06:10.734 --> 06:14.171
the land together again as two friends.

06:14.656 --> 06:16.554
Da da da!

06:16.729 --> 06:17.608
- Wow.

06:17.603 --> 06:19.042
- Wow.

06:21.066 --> 06:24.123
- So when would you go
away if you go away?

06:26.070 --> 06:27.878
- That's up to us.

06:28.354 --> 06:29.833
What do you think?

06:29.835 --> 06:30.765
- Can I come?

06:30.763 --> 06:32.510
- No, you've got school.

06:32.509 --> 06:35.086
- How long would you be gone for?

06:35.680 --> 06:39.097
- If I make the team,
maybe a couple of months.

06:39.095 --> 06:40.344
- Like two?

06:40.342 --> 06:42.309
- Or more like three.

06:42.388 --> 06:43.736
- What do you get if you win?

06:45.051 --> 06:46.050
- A medal.

06:46.053 --> 06:47.002
- Can I have it?

06:47.001 --> 06:47.650
- Yes.

06:47.651 --> 06:48.630
- Then you'd better win.

06:48.631 --> 06:49.820
- Okay, I will.

06:49.814 --> 06:50.643
- Promise?

06:50.645 --> 06:52.104
- I promise.

06:52.844 --> 06:55.111
So I guess it's all set then, huh?

06:55.107 --> 06:56.247
- Okay.

06:56.248 --> 06:57.197
- You sure?
- Yeah.

06:57.196 --> 06:58.234
- You positive?
- Mm-hmm.

06:58.241 --> 06:59.130
- Really, truly?
- Yes.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.194
- Absolutely?
- Yes.

07:00.191 --> 07:01.290
- Okay.

07:04.428 --> 07:05.957
Here you go.

07:08.073 --> 07:10.031
You have sweet dreams.

07:10.394 --> 07:11.922
- I love you, daddy.

07:11.926 --> 07:13.894
- I love you too, Walter.

07:14.174 --> 07:15.243
Night night.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.578
- Goodnight.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.455
Dad?

07:20.458 --> 07:21.697
- Hmm?

07:21.694 --> 07:23.502
- You better win.

07:24.145 --> 07:25.673
- You got it.

07:48.057 --> 07:49.926
- Kim Yung.

07:55.419 --> 07:56.248
Cho Han.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.697
Tung Sun.

08:05.549 --> 08:07.248
Kwon Sae Jin.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.146
- Korea! Korea!

08:46.524 --> 08:48.432
- Goddamn circus.

09:00.459 --> 09:02.177
- Mind if I borrow your tape, man?

09:02.175 --> 09:04.143
- Matter of fact, I do mind.

09:09.580 --> 09:10.999
- Here you go.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.145
- Thanks, man.

09:22.198 --> 09:23.467
- Point.

09:37.165 --> 09:38.743
Point white.

09:49.653 --> 09:51.421
- Shouldn't block with your face.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.228
- His mama probably
didn't breast feed him.

09:57.835 --> 10:00.244
- Breast feeding is
actually very high in iron.

10:00.245 --> 10:02.223
I was very fond of it as a child.

10:02.503 --> 10:04.231
- I'm still fond of it.

10:04.656 --> 10:06.754
Sonny, Sonny Grasso.

10:06.763 --> 10:08.381
My friends call me Sonny.

10:08.372 --> 10:09.671
I'm Italian.

10:09.672 --> 10:11.191
- I'm Virgil Keller.

10:11.196 --> 10:14.282
I used to be Italian, now I'm a Buddhist.

10:15.468 --> 10:17.296
I'm just kidding, I was never Italian.

10:17.301 --> 10:18.990
- I knew that.

10:19.176 --> 10:21.544
- Sonny Grasso
and Travis Brickley,

10:21.542 --> 10:23.800
please report to ring three.

10:24.238 --> 10:26.915
- Look, the cowboy.

10:35.061 --> 10:37.709
- Have a nice day, knucklehead.

11:03.513 --> 11:05.141
- Point red.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.413
- What are you talking about?

11:06.410 --> 11:07.829
He hit me in the arm!

11:07.827 --> 11:09.425
He hit me in the arm.

11:11.982 --> 11:13.671
Are you blind?

11:16.298 --> 11:17.906
- Hey, it was a good fight.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.025
- We can fix that.

11:27.028 --> 11:28.497
He's a fighter.

12:05.239 --> 12:08.085
- I don't know about you
guys, but I'm impressed.

12:08.083 --> 12:11.150
Good lord, half the board
of directors are out there.

12:11.152 --> 12:12.571
They went completely nuts.

12:12.569 --> 12:14.467
Frank, believe me, you'll
get anything you need,

12:14.466 --> 12:15.465
first class.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.156
- I expect no less.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.903
This is your team.

12:25.231 --> 12:26.709
- Frank.

12:30.794 --> 12:35.199
Are you absolutely sure
about this kid Alex Grady?

12:35.226 --> 12:38.044
I saw him take quite a beating
a couple years back, Frank.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.998
And he's got a gimpy
shoulder, you know that.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.766
- Mr. Jennings, your
expertise is business.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.988
Mine is choosing and training champions.

12:46.990 --> 12:48.558
No offense.

13:02.877 --> 13:07.872
- On behalf of the sponsors,
the US Karate Federation,

13:08.599 --> 13:13.365
Coach Couzo and his staff,
it's my pleasure to announce

13:13.363 --> 13:18.357
the names of the five young
men who will represent

13:19.042 --> 13:23.727
the United States of America
in competition against

13:23.730 --> 13:25.718
Team Korea.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.299
When I announce your name, please rise

13:28.300 --> 13:30.628
and approach the podium.

13:32.977 --> 13:35.884
Travis Brickley, Miami, Florida.

13:38.434 --> 13:41.950
Virgil Keller, Providence, Rhode Island.

13:45.935 --> 13:49.063
Sonny Grasso, Detroit, Michigan.

13:50.730 --> 13:55.456
Thomas Lee, Fresno, California.

13:58.519 --> 14:00.486
And the final selection,

14:01.599 --> 14:05.305
Alexander Grady, Portland, Oregon.

14:07.726 --> 14:10.443
Congratulations, men, and welcome to the

14:10.443 --> 14:13.350
US National Team.

14:19.182 --> 14:21.440
- It's been a long time.

14:22.848 --> 14:23.677
How you doing?

14:23.679 --> 14:24.398
- How you doing?

14:24.403 --> 14:25.193
- Alexander Grady.

14:25.192 --> 14:25.980
- Tommy Lee.

14:27.704 --> 14:30.063
- Excuse me, fellas, fellas.

14:30.184 --> 14:31.383
Can I get...

14:31.382 --> 14:33.280
- At ease.

14:35.441 --> 14:39.288
Anybody not a member
of this team or staff.

14:39.681 --> 14:41.460
You are dismissed.

14:42.421 --> 14:44.899
Okay, listen.

14:46.555 --> 14:50.601
My name is Frank Couzo.

14:51.009 --> 14:56.004
To you I'm either Coach or Mr. Couzo.

14:58.244 --> 15:02.360
Starting tomorrow, you are mine

15:02.900 --> 15:05.118
for the next three months.

15:05.363 --> 15:10.357
That means no women, no alcohol, no drugs.

15:14.526 --> 15:19.271
You will eat, sleep, and shit competition.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.173
There are only two other rules.

15:23.359 --> 15:27.415
Number one, don't be late.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.977
Don't ever be late.

15:31.509 --> 15:35.955
It shows disrespect to me, to the sport,

15:36.348 --> 15:38.596
and to your teammates.

15:38.883 --> 15:43.279
Two, we expect you to function as a team.

15:44.191 --> 15:47.336
I'll say this only once.

15:48.740 --> 15:53.545
A team is not a team if
you don't give a damn

15:53.546 --> 15:55.674
about one another.

15:56.582 --> 16:01.578
You are now members of the
US National Karate Team.

16:02.634 --> 16:06.651
You represent the United
States of America.

16:06.971 --> 16:10.957
Remember that and we will
accomplish our objective.

16:11.052 --> 16:15.458
Our only objective, which is to win.

16:15.783 --> 16:16.553
- Yeah.

16:19.033 --> 16:20.372
- One more thing.

16:20.376 --> 16:22.054
When you get settled into night,

16:22.049 --> 16:24.177
Don will escort you into town.

16:24.180 --> 16:27.077
It's your last night in three months.

16:27.078 --> 16:30.305
If some of you are lucky,
you might even get laid.

16:31.863 --> 16:34.570
Knowing the high standards
of the local females,

16:34.569 --> 16:37.026
I seriously doubt it.

16:37.638 --> 16:42.623
But that bus leaves at 1900
hours sharp, gentlemen.

16:43.594 --> 16:45.092
- 1900 what?

16:45.086 --> 16:46.865
- 7:00 PM, pinhead.

16:46.866 --> 16:48.853
- I knew that.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.694
- Frank, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

16:52.694 --> 16:55.410
Someone I met last year
on a trip to the far east.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.878
Quite an extraordinary person, really.

16:57.872 --> 16:59.391
Trained in all kinds of things.

16:59.396 --> 17:02.193
Psychology, sports medicine, kinetics.

17:02.189 --> 17:05.224
Has a new book out now
on the power of the mind.

17:05.224 --> 17:08.071
Something of a sensei, actually.

17:08.079 --> 17:11.636
- Look, Mr. Jennings, I
was hired by the board

17:11.627 --> 17:13.955
to do a job and I intend to do it.

17:13.963 --> 17:16.130
- Nobody's questioning that, Frank.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.531
- I don't need any damn sensei.

17:20.760 --> 17:25.755
- Frank, there's a
trainer's position opening

17:27.598 --> 17:32.065
and we would like Wade
to fill that position.

17:32.928 --> 17:35.076
No offense.

17:38.174 --> 17:39.972
- I see.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.253
- Right this way, boys.

17:55.192 --> 17:57.170
- Oh, so sorry.

18:07.866 --> 18:09.574
- Well, this is us.

18:10.146 --> 18:11.434
- Is it okay if I take this one?

18:11.432 --> 18:13.451
- Yeah sure, man, go ahead.

18:26.086 --> 18:27.734
- You have a kid.

18:28.002 --> 18:29.691
- Yeah, well that's an old picture.

18:29.697 --> 18:31.554
Walter's five now.

18:31.551 --> 18:33.029
- Five going on 30, huh?

18:33.031 --> 18:34.479
- Yeah, how'd you know?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.078
- I work with kids, teaching.

18:37.656 --> 18:39.754
Your wife's very pretty.

18:40.065 --> 18:42.122
- Yeah, she was.

18:42.386 --> 18:44.484
She died when Walter was a baby.

18:44.725 --> 18:46.533
- I'm sorry.

18:47.681 --> 18:49.490
- Yeah, me too.

18:57.497 --> 18:59.924
- Man, this definitely ain't Detroit.

19:00.203 --> 19:01.522
- I never been to Detroit.

19:01.522 --> 19:02.641
What's it like?

19:02.641 --> 19:03.570
- What?

19:03.568 --> 19:05.435
- Detroit, what's it like?

19:05.443 --> 19:08.559
- Well, it's what you might call urban.

19:08.553 --> 19:10.242
It's kind of post urban,
you know, like those

19:10.248 --> 19:12.266
movies of Berlin after the war.

19:12.261 --> 19:14.370
Well that's the view out my window.

19:14.651 --> 19:15.820
- Ash tray?

19:15.819 --> 19:17.047
- Sure.

19:18.183 --> 19:19.811
You sure have a lot of gear, man.

19:19.814 --> 19:21.272
- What's that you say?

19:21.274 --> 19:22.043
- What?

19:22.041 --> 19:23.919
Oh, I said you sure have a lot of gear.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.395
- Oh gee, I got every major tournament

19:25.397 --> 19:26.675
the last five years.

19:26.675 --> 19:27.395
- Oh do you?

19:27.401 --> 19:28.020
- Right here.

19:28.018 --> 19:30.326
If you want statistics, lookie here.

19:30.320 --> 19:34.716
Hell, I got statistics on every
major fighter in the world.

19:34.721 --> 19:36.159
That's right.

19:36.159 --> 19:38.486
I'm something of a
collector, you might say.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.600
- Yeah, me too.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.369
Check this out.

19:43.635 --> 19:45.814
This is rare shit.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.511
- That's fantastic.

19:52.510 --> 19:54.199
That is fantastic.

19:59.916 --> 20:02.723
- Virgil, I've seen some
fine looking local snapper

20:02.719 --> 20:05.496
out there and I think they
could use some of this

20:05.500 --> 20:09.696
sweet Miami love muscle, if you
know what I'm talking about.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.901
Virgil, what the hell are you doing?

20:11.903 --> 20:13.531
You can do that for three months.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.061
We're talking about young things.

20:15.057 --> 20:17.944
We're talking about inner
and outer labia here.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.890
We're talking about the bus leaving if you

20:19.884 --> 20:21.143
don't get up and get dressed.

20:21.142 --> 20:22.910
You look like a pinata.

20:23.731 --> 20:26.428
Virgil, what are you going to do?

20:26.427 --> 20:28.504
Sit around and play with
your ball all night?

20:28.889 --> 20:30.127
Virgil.

20:31.766 --> 20:33.104
Virgil!

20:35.825 --> 20:38.593
All right, I'll go it alone.

20:45.095 --> 20:46.433
- Travis.

20:47.951 --> 20:51.268
Inner and outer labia?

21:13.630 --> 21:15.219
- Simple enough, Frank.

21:22.139 --> 21:23.647
- That's right.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.707
- You going number one or number two?

21:42.715 --> 21:44.243
- Drop dead.

21:48.818 --> 21:50.506
- Later, sport.

22:01.422 --> 22:03.020
- Excuse me.

22:03.169 --> 22:04.757
- I'm sorry!

22:04.906 --> 22:06.665
I've got a thing here.

22:06.718 --> 22:08.276
You all right, did it burn you?

22:08.273 --> 22:10.500
- No, no, it's okay.

22:10.499 --> 22:11.469
- Bartender, this isn't hot enough.

22:11.470 --> 22:13.547
Irish coffee is supposed to be hot.

22:13.878 --> 22:15.676
- What did he say?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.848
- I'm kidding.

22:20.175 --> 22:21.933
- I thought you were serious.

22:21.933 --> 22:23.331
- No, I'm Virgil.

22:23.328 --> 22:24.368
- Carol Anne.

22:24.374 --> 22:25.143
- Hi.

22:25.141 --> 22:25.990
- Hi.

22:25.993 --> 22:27.681
- Carol Anne.

22:28.379 --> 22:29.798
- Would you like to dance?

22:29.797 --> 22:31.366
- I'd love to.

22:31.608 --> 22:32.917
- Good.

22:36.851 --> 22:39.289
- You burned her hand
and she'd love to dance?

23:08.921 --> 23:10.499
- Want to dance?

23:11.418 --> 23:12.417
- Love to.

23:12.414 --> 23:14.102
- Well let's go.

23:22.340 --> 23:23.378
- Nothing.

23:23.383 --> 23:24.173
Nothing.

23:24.173 --> 23:25.011
Vodka.

23:25.014 --> 23:26.223
- Vodka.

23:26.219 --> 23:27.488
- How you doing this evening?

23:27.486 --> 23:29.374
- I don't understand it, man.

23:29.373 --> 23:30.481
- What?

23:30.480 --> 23:32.448
- I mean, women love me.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.509
- Not tonight.

23:34.508 --> 23:35.038
- What?

23:35.041 --> 23:36.989
- Not tonight they don't.

23:36.991 --> 23:38.609
- Yeah, but I'm Italian.

23:38.610 --> 23:40.508
- You know, well Virgil's doing great.

23:40.507 --> 23:43.084
Maybe you should become a Buddhist.

23:46.335 --> 23:48.564
- What could they be talking about?

23:48.563 --> 23:50.760
- Buddha.

23:51.344 --> 23:53.781
- It's one of those
conditioned automatic response

23:53.784 --> 23:55.593
patterns that just gets in the way of our

23:55.584 --> 23:57.373
natural abilities, you know?

23:57.374 --> 23:58.633
- I know.

24:00.491 --> 24:02.039
- Sweet bellybutton.

24:02.042 --> 24:03.550
I'm going to give it a shot.

24:05.015 --> 24:07.563
- He's a dog, an absolute dog.

24:14.413 --> 24:18.079
- Hey Burt, you might want
to check the dance floor.

24:28.627 --> 24:31.754
- Yes, uh, a collect call from Alex.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.348
- Where do you live, Kelly?

24:40.448 --> 24:42.826
- About a drink away.

24:44.781 --> 24:47.049
- That's a nice neighborhood.

24:47.719 --> 24:49.597
- That's as far as you go.

24:49.594 --> 24:54.299
- Oh god, it took you until
now to realize I was gone?

24:59.336 --> 25:01.415
Go away, Burt.

25:01.411 --> 25:03.299
- Yeah Burt, go away.

25:04.566 --> 25:05.694
- Hey.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.558
Shit baby, I'm sorry.

25:08.558 --> 25:10.946
- Well that's a good move, Burt.

25:11.127 --> 25:13.195
Don't take any lip from her.

25:13.374 --> 25:15.602
- Didn't take Mr.
Personality long, did it?

25:15.601 --> 25:17.179
- God, I hate this.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.410
- Don't you go.

25:21.408 --> 25:23.027
- Keep in touch, fellas.

25:23.029 --> 25:24.227
- Hey!

25:28.247 --> 25:30.134
- We're out of here just like that.

25:30.135 --> 25:31.165
- Who's this asshole?

25:31.158 --> 25:32.518
- Hey, hey, hey.

25:33.641 --> 25:35.340
He said he was sorry.

25:35.335 --> 25:37.444
- Hey, who the hell are you?

25:39.851 --> 25:41.769
Very impressive.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.008
- I don't want to fight you guys.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.550
We're out of here.

25:46.543 --> 25:48.272
- I want him, I want his balls.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.258
- I thought you were
missing a pair, asshole.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.528
- Shut up, Travis.

25:51.528 --> 25:53.167
- You're dead, pal.

25:56.331 --> 25:57.690
- Get him, Burt!

26:01.969 --> 26:03.148
- What?

26:03.151 --> 26:04.570
No.

26:04.568 --> 26:07.146
No, Walter, you cannot drive the car, no.

26:29.523 --> 26:31.511
No, no, there is nothing to discuss.

26:31.516 --> 26:32.995
Put your grandmother on.

26:51.251 --> 26:52.830
Uh, ma, I gotta go.

26:52.827 --> 26:54.416
Give Walter a kiss.

27:26.213 --> 27:28.450
- This is just like Detroit.

27:47.002 --> 27:49.609
- Okay, gentlemen, break it up.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.429
Let's go, Virgil.

27:51.477 --> 27:52.996
Come on, Grasso.

27:52.990 --> 27:55.098
Let's go, gentlemen.

27:57.027 --> 27:58.566
That's enough.

27:59.231 --> 28:01.419
That's enough, Brickley.

28:03.546 --> 28:04.525
- Good move, man.

28:04.525 --> 28:05.804
- I didn't want to fight.

28:05.804 --> 28:08.342
- All I wanted was a beer, shit happens.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.440
- Excuse me, Coach Couzo?

28:29.445 --> 28:30.624
- Yes.

28:30.628 --> 28:33.175
- I'm Catherine Wade, I
believe you're expecting me.

28:34.514 --> 28:36.301
May I sit down?

28:39.280 --> 28:40.299
- Say, I'd like to introduce myself.

28:40.303 --> 28:41.392
I'm Don Peterson.

28:41.391 --> 28:42.240
- How do you do.

28:42.243 --> 28:43.421
- Would you like some coffee, Miss Wade?

28:43.425 --> 28:44.953
- No thank you.

28:48.719 --> 28:51.067
- Look, Miss Wade, I'll
get right to the point.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.710
This was not my idea.

28:52.715 --> 28:54.613
I was hired to coach the
team, and quite frankly

28:54.610 --> 28:56.309
I don't need any help, particularly.

28:56.305 --> 28:57.883
- From a woman.

28:57.882 --> 28:59.791
Well, I am a woman, Mr. Couzo.

28:59.790 --> 29:02.427
But in spite of this
handicap, I'm hopeful that in

29:02.436 --> 29:04.574
the next few months my
usefulness to this team

29:04.567 --> 29:05.866
will become apparent.

29:05.867 --> 29:07.555
- What exactly do you intend to do here?

29:07.561 --> 29:09.839
- Train, Mr. Couzo, I'm a trainer.

29:09.830 --> 29:11.459
- Don Peterson is my trainer.

29:11.461 --> 29:12.820
Why do I need you?

29:12.825 --> 29:15.272
- Well, I was raised in the far east.

29:15.266 --> 29:17.902
I've studied eastern
philosophy all of my life.

29:17.907 --> 29:21.864
This includes Buddhism,
Hinduism, Yoga, and meditation.

29:21.989 --> 29:24.306
I also hold a belt in Tae Kwon Do.

29:24.309 --> 29:27.047
- I'm sure that makes you
a very well rounded person.

29:27.048 --> 29:28.456
- I would like to share what I've learned

29:28.454 --> 29:30.202
with the American team.

29:31.041 --> 29:34.057
- Look, Miss Wade, Mr.
Jennings hired you and I

29:34.058 --> 29:36.406
have to accept that, I just
don't know where you fit in.

29:36.403 --> 29:40.199
- Coach, even with my help
it will be difficult if not

29:40.206 --> 29:43.643
nearly impossible to
defeat a team from Korea.

29:43.638 --> 29:47.244
As you know, their
training is as much mental

29:47.250 --> 29:49.019
as it is physical, and
they've been doing it for

29:49.019 --> 29:50.667
most of their lives.

29:50.659 --> 29:52.888
We only have three months.

29:52.886 --> 29:56.414
Excuse me for saying so,
Coach, but without my help,

29:56.414 --> 29:59.921
all of your modern training
techniques and high tech

29:59.920 --> 30:02.097
equipment won't mean shit.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.743
- Good morning, gentlemen.

30:24.807 --> 30:28.454
At my side are your new team warm up

30:28.452 --> 30:33.447
uniforms and jackets, courtesy
of our official sponsor.

30:35.271 --> 30:39.817
However, until you become a team and have

30:39.810 --> 30:42.898
earned the right to wear
them, what you have on

30:42.900 --> 30:44.889
will suffice.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.853
Okay, I want 20 laps around the track.

30:52.874 --> 30:53.902
- 20?

30:53.897 --> 30:55.375
That's five miles.

30:55.378 --> 30:57.256
- That's right, Grasso.

30:57.253 --> 30:58.942
- I knew that.

30:59.065 --> 31:00.523
- Let's go.

31:00.898 --> 31:02.336
Move it.

31:07.279 --> 31:12.274
Something so strong
driving me on, never tire

31:16.199 --> 31:21.194
Something so strong, born of the sun

31:21.778 --> 31:26.774
Like a fire, sea of fire,
burns inside me so strong

31:30.426 --> 31:31.455
- How you feeling?

31:31.449 --> 31:33.297
- This is kicking my ass, man.

31:33.303 --> 31:34.742
I don't think I can do it.

31:34.742 --> 31:36.470
- Hang in there.

31:36.733 --> 31:38.132
- 163.

31:38.133 --> 31:39.122
164.

31:40.539 --> 31:41.657
165.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.366
- Trainers out.

31:45.903 --> 31:47.801
At ease, gentlemen.

31:50.195 --> 31:52.003
They're listening.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.798
- Good morning.

32:10.239 --> 32:12.226
My name is Catherine Wade.

32:13.041 --> 32:15.988
I'm Mr. Couzo's new assistant trainer.

32:16.738 --> 32:19.634
You are all very talented athletes

32:19.701 --> 32:21.719
and chosen for good reason.

32:21.789 --> 32:25.245
However, talent alone is not enough.

32:26.381 --> 32:30.577
We have a very powerful
adversary in the Koreans

32:31.027 --> 32:33.475
and very little time to prepare.

32:33.713 --> 32:37.059
So while Coach Couzo
and Don work with your

32:37.058 --> 32:41.224
fighting technique, I will
work with your concentration.

32:42.268 --> 32:45.095
At the end of the three
months, you will have a

32:45.103 --> 32:49.958
balanced mind, sharp as a
razor, a body of perfect

32:49.951 --> 32:54.946
health and strength, a
spirit of peace and clarity.

32:57.517 --> 33:02.082
This is the final
conditioning needed to win.

33:02.758 --> 33:04.586
Are there any questions?

33:04.869 --> 33:06.867
- What's your phone number?

33:08.141 --> 33:10.638
- I'm here to teach you how to win.

33:11.922 --> 33:14.330
Winning isn't a sometime thing.

33:14.331 --> 33:16.789
Winning is an all time thing.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.439
We don't win once in a while.

33:19.434 --> 33:22.432
We don't do the right
thing once in a while.

33:22.429 --> 33:24.946
We do the right thing all of the time.

33:25.486 --> 33:27.434
Winning is a habit.

33:27.436 --> 33:30.104
Unfortunately, so is losing.

33:30.292 --> 33:32.030
- Hey, that's good.

33:32.029 --> 33:34.167
- That's Vince Lombardi.

33:37.484 --> 33:38.894
Coach.

33:42.429 --> 33:43.398
- Tommy.

33:43.399 --> 33:44.089
- Yeah?

33:44.091 --> 33:46.019
- How old were you when
you started training?

33:46.020 --> 33:48.108
- When I was about four.

33:48.108 --> 33:50.376
- Four? Shit.

33:51.870 --> 33:53.698
You got any brothers or sisters?

33:55.530 --> 33:56.849
- No.

33:57.347 --> 33:58.805
Goodnight, Alex.

33:58.806 --> 34:00.455
- Goodnight, Tommy.

34:17.366 --> 34:19.134
- And one.

34:20.168 --> 34:21.485
And two.

34:22.001 --> 34:23.090
Put your shoulder into it.

34:23.089 --> 34:24.397
Three.

34:24.974 --> 34:26.303
And four.

35:33.999 --> 35:37.755
- Gentlemen, you'll be
competing using eastern rules.

35:38.017 --> 35:40.754
In the event of a tie, the
winner will be determined

35:40.755 --> 35:43.403
in a competition of strength and focus.

35:43.398 --> 35:45.945
The objective is to
break as many as you can

35:45.944 --> 35:49.321
in one blow using the hand or head.

35:50.121 --> 35:51.720
- Center yourself.

35:51.720 --> 35:54.776
Thought and action must be one.

35:54.852 --> 35:57.450
There can be no hesitation.

35:58.305 --> 36:00.623
- Who wants to go first?

36:05.892 --> 36:08.429
Miss Wade will demonstrate.

36:36.814 --> 36:37.852
- Impressive.

36:41.193 --> 36:43.491
- Okay, who's next?

36:59.733 --> 37:01.901
- Sit down, man, take a load off.

37:02.631 --> 37:04.370
Hey, spare ribs.

37:04.368 --> 37:06.296
Now that's a white man's meal, Virg.

37:06.297 --> 37:07.866
Real food.

37:08.886 --> 37:10.025
You keep eating that shit, you'll end up

37:10.026 --> 37:11.904
like Hop Sing over there.

37:13.947 --> 37:17.304
Your eyes will slant, dick will shrink up.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.686
You'll open up a laundry.

37:23.175 --> 37:24.694
- That's harsh.

37:24.689 --> 37:27.285
- Hey, you don't eat that
raw fish shit do you?

37:27.288 --> 37:29.285
- Travis, why don't you shut up?

37:29.280 --> 37:31.208
- Does it look like I'm talking to you?

37:31.208 --> 37:32.867
- Alex, it's all right.

37:32.871 --> 37:34.699
- You're damn right it's all right.

37:35.034 --> 37:36.582
You're damn right it's all right.

37:36.591 --> 37:38.189
- Hey, get your own ribs.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.386
- Are you scared?

37:41.384 --> 37:42.733
- Alex.

37:42.739 --> 37:44.536
Please, sit down.

37:44.540 --> 37:46.538
- Yeah, sit down, Alex.

37:47.725 --> 37:49.204
What do you boys think?

37:49.206 --> 37:50.754
Think he's yellow?

37:51.849 --> 37:53.777
So what about it?

37:53.777 --> 37:55.845
You yellow, huh?

37:58.671 --> 37:59.770
- Obviously.

38:14.513 --> 38:16.791
- These are your
opponents, gentlemen.

38:16.782 --> 38:18.510
If you were to fight them today,

38:18.520 --> 38:21.796
you'd all be carried out on stretchers.

38:22.749 --> 38:25.846
Losing would be the least of your worries.

38:25.850 --> 38:28.228
- This is some of the Asian training.

38:28.227 --> 38:31.094
Remember this when you think Coach Couzo

38:31.093 --> 38:33.280
is being too tough on you.

38:38.671 --> 38:41.578
The Koreans train 12
months a year and enjoy

38:41.577 --> 38:44.465
the full financial support
of their national government.

38:44.474 --> 38:46.142
- Don.

38:46.380 --> 38:48.408
Study these briefs carefully.

38:48.832 --> 38:50.930
The more you know about your opponent,

38:50.935 --> 38:53.063
better prepared you'll be.

38:53.855 --> 38:55.144
Wade.

38:55.238 --> 38:59.083
- Yung Kim, 155 pounds, gold medal 1984

38:59.084 --> 39:00.973
world championship.

39:00.971 --> 39:03.708
Silver medal, Tokyo Invitational.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.068
He's yours, Sonny.

39:05.073 --> 39:06.651
- Ah, great.

39:06.650 --> 39:09.368
- He's crippled more than one
fighter with his strength.

39:09.367 --> 39:10.855
- Wonderful.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.097
- That's why we're
going to make your moves

39:12.106 --> 39:14.194
smaller and more focused.

39:16.771 --> 39:20.268
Travis, meet Mr. Tung Sung Moon.

39:20.268 --> 39:23.225
Gold medal 1985 world championship.

39:26.106 --> 39:29.023
Virgil, this is Mr. Han Cho.

39:29.026 --> 39:32.663
Gold medal 1986, Hong Kong invitational.

39:32.660 --> 39:34.589
They are completely singleminded in their

39:34.589 --> 39:36.966
pursuit of excellence.

39:37.998 --> 39:41.295
Alexander, meet Mr. Sae Jin Kwan.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.908
Currently weighted number
one in his division.

39:43.933 --> 39:46.600
The best fighter of his generation.

39:47.738 --> 39:49.765
Gentlemen, many fighters have died

39:49.760 --> 39:52.198
in the ring from such blows.

39:52.818 --> 39:55.666
Tommy, you win the prize.

39:57.272 --> 40:02.267
- Dae Han, 176
pounds, 35 years old.

40:03.047 --> 40:06.764
Winner of every major invitational
for the last 10 years.

40:07.150 --> 40:08.789
Whatever you may think of his age, never

40:08.780 --> 40:10.998
underestimate his ability.

40:11.007 --> 40:13.204
He's won gold medals for the '84 to '88

40:13.202 --> 40:14.970
world championships.

40:14.971 --> 40:17.058
He's still rated number one in the world.

40:17.809 --> 40:19.757
- No problem.

40:22.814 --> 40:25.861
- Gentlemen these tapes
are always available to you.

40:25.861 --> 40:29.458
Watch them, observe
strengths and weaknesses.

40:29.452 --> 40:30.910
Knowing them can mean the difference

40:30.911 --> 40:32.970
between victory and defeat.

40:54.106 --> 40:56.524
- Tommy look, there's David.

42:01.396 --> 42:05.452
Someone will lose, someone must win

42:05.638 --> 42:08.604
Only the strong will survive

42:09.355 --> 42:11.523
Reach for the best

42:11.582 --> 42:13.959
You have within

42:14.086 --> 42:17.803
There is no compromise

42:18.210 --> 42:20.898
You have to stand up and fight

42:20.906 --> 42:22.883
When the challenge is right

42:22.877 --> 42:24.825
Through your tears and the pain

42:24.827 --> 42:27.304
Still the glory remains

42:27.309 --> 42:29.477
You see the vision in sight

42:29.473 --> 42:33.619
Put yourself to the test

42:33.671 --> 42:37.547
Be the best of the best

43:03.591 --> 43:05.379
- White two, red zero.

43:09.148 --> 43:11.205
That's not a point, Tommy.

43:11.370 --> 43:12.869
- Punk!

43:13.393 --> 43:15.101
- Bow to each other.

43:21.970 --> 43:23.539
- That's enough!

43:23.641 --> 43:25.649
- All right, gentlemen, hit the showers.

43:26.347 --> 43:28.366
Hit the showers.

43:30.832 --> 43:32.230
Quickly.

43:34.197 --> 43:36.284
What the hell is wrong with you?

43:36.288 --> 43:38.984
You better shape up or you're
going to be hisrory, boy.

43:38.982 --> 43:40.511
You got it?

43:44.841 --> 43:47.149
That was quite an exhibition.

43:47.463 --> 43:51.089
I'd be lying to you if I
didn't tell you it worries me.

43:51.438 --> 43:52.685
Tommy, a man of your talent.

43:52.694 --> 43:54.063
- What's on your mind, coach?

43:54.057 --> 43:55.296
- You had a chance to take Travis out

43:55.295 --> 43:56.813
and you didn't, you're holding back.

43:56.818 --> 43:58.097
That worries me.

43:58.097 --> 44:00.365
- Coach, I'm fine.

44:00.367 --> 44:01.665
- Then why didn't you finish it?

44:01.666 --> 44:03.344
What are you afraid of?

44:03.340 --> 44:04.898
- What's that supposed to mean?

44:05.774 --> 44:08.601
- Dae Han won't give you a second chance.

44:48.218 --> 44:50.216
- Anybody else seen this?

44:50.842 --> 44:52.490
- Nobody.

44:54.761 --> 44:57.040
- Let's keep it that way.

45:11.275 --> 45:13.693
- Tommy, Tommy.

45:18.191 --> 45:19.679
You okay, man?

45:21.102 --> 45:22.710
- Yeah.

45:23.998 --> 45:26.005
- It's kinda late, buddy.

45:28.078 --> 45:30.386
- Dae Han is working just as hard.

45:30.380 --> 45:32.228
- Bet your ass on that.

45:32.234 --> 45:33.932
But even Dae Han sleeps.

45:35.397 --> 45:37.245
- You sure about that?

45:37.243 --> 45:39.630
- Yeah, I'm sure about that.

45:40.610 --> 45:42.108
- Let's get some sleep.

45:42.113 --> 45:43.601
- Let's do it.

46:48.216 --> 46:50.283
- Visualize the energy radiating from

46:50.282 --> 46:52.970
your abdomen out to the world.

46:53.510 --> 46:55.290
Breathe deeply.

46:55.344 --> 46:57.922
Inhale joy, courage.

46:58.818 --> 47:01.965
Exhale fear, doubt.

47:03.315 --> 47:05.502
Visualize the energy radiating from

47:05.499 --> 47:08.905
the center of your being
out into the world.

47:09.909 --> 47:13.396
This is your key, your life force.

47:14.897 --> 47:18.673
This is where you will
find your greatest power.

48:22.807 --> 48:23.786
- Hey Travis, you're gonna be late.

48:23.789 --> 48:24.948
- It's for you.

48:24.949 --> 48:25.549
- What?

48:25.547 --> 48:27.075
- You want it? Get it.

48:30.088 --> 48:31.635
- Hello.

48:32.057 --> 48:33.306
Ma.

48:36.043 --> 48:37.541
When?

48:45.259 --> 48:46.857
- Push it, come on.

48:47.273 --> 48:48.942
Get your butt in here, Grady.

48:48.946 --> 48:50.264
- Hey coach, we gotta talk.

48:50.267 --> 48:51.635
- I'm not interested.

48:51.630 --> 48:53.009
You're out of uniform, Grady.

48:53.005 --> 48:54.624
- Coach, I gotta talk to you.

48:54.625 --> 48:56.223
- Hey Alex, what's wrong.

48:56.223 --> 48:57.482
- Outside, Grady.

48:57.481 --> 48:58.909
- Okay, in a minute.

48:59.100 --> 49:03.067
Coach, my boy Walter, he got hit by a car.

49:03.192 --> 49:04.161
He was on his bicycle.

49:04.161 --> 49:05.759
He's so small they didn't even see him

49:05.759 --> 49:07.178
and he's hurt really bad.

49:07.177 --> 49:08.385
- I'm sorry to hear that, Grady.

49:08.381 --> 49:09.450
- Anyway, I gotta go home.

49:09.458 --> 49:10.897
I'll be back as soon as I can.

49:10.896 --> 49:12.184
- You know the program.

49:12.185 --> 49:15.652
Three months, no
distractions, no exceptions.

49:15.648 --> 49:16.717
Those are the rules.

49:16.714 --> 49:18.502
- Don't talk to me about rules, coach.

49:18.504 --> 49:20.472
My kid might lose his leg.

49:20.475 --> 49:21.933
- We all have our priorities.

49:21.934 --> 49:23.403
- What?

49:23.395 --> 49:26.072
Are you telling me that if
I leave I can't come back?

49:26.080 --> 49:27.409
- That's right.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.769
- What is wrong with you?

49:29.777 --> 49:32.005
What the hell is wrong with you?

49:32.004 --> 49:33.563
Put yourself in my place.

49:33.559 --> 49:35.507
- I'm not in your place, Grady.

49:35.509 --> 49:37.288
We leave for Korea in three days.

49:37.289 --> 49:38.807
It's your choice.

49:40.051 --> 49:42.369
- There is no choice.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.458
I'm outta here.

49:50.468 --> 49:51.586
- Alex, what's up?

49:51.586 --> 49:53.185
- My kid's been hurt, I gotta go.

49:53.185 --> 49:54.065
- Don't worry about this.

49:54.069 --> 49:55.178
We will be here when you get back.

49:55.177 --> 49:56.945
- You heard him, I can't come back.

49:56.946 --> 49:58.195
- Just get back here.

49:58.193 --> 49:59.631
We'll deal with Couzo then.

49:59.631 --> 50:01.240
- Look, you're here.

50:01.240 --> 50:02.129
I gotta go.

50:02.135 --> 50:04.303
- Hey, hey, hey.

50:04.299 --> 50:05.518
- Thanks.

50:07.517 --> 50:09.475
- Mr.
Grady, I'm Dr. Weisman.

50:09.477 --> 50:10.485
- How is he?

50:10.479 --> 50:12.327
- Well, he'll
wear a cast for six weeks,

50:12.333 --> 50:13.772
but the leg is not the problem.

50:13.772 --> 50:14.451
- What do you mean?

50:14.451 --> 50:16.309
- Mr. Grady,
your son is in a coma.

50:16.305 --> 50:18.073
There appear to be no other complications,

50:18.073 --> 50:20.271
but I must tell you he
could remain unconscious

50:20.268 --> 50:22.306
for an hour or a month.

50:22.335 --> 50:23.315
- Oh my god.

50:23.316 --> 50:24.784
I want to see him.

50:43.167 --> 50:44.735
Walter.

50:47.504 --> 50:49.542
Walter, can you hear me?

50:50.956 --> 50:52.845
It's daddy.

50:54.647 --> 50:56.634
Daddy's here.

51:01.494 --> 51:03.252
Walter.

51:04.207 --> 51:06.105
Don't leave me.

51:08.756 --> 51:10.704
I need you.

51:49.845 --> 51:51.283
Walter?

51:56.056 --> 51:58.394
- I crashed myself.

51:59.103 --> 52:01.131
- Yes you did.

52:02.599 --> 52:04.427
We're here, Walter.

52:04.804 --> 52:06.763
We're right here.

52:08.682 --> 52:10.430
That's my boy.

52:15.692 --> 52:16.880
- Recoil, Travis.

52:16.872 --> 52:18.691
- Okay Travis, go for it.

52:20.643 --> 52:23.290
- It's 57 mile per hour,
195 pounds pressure.

52:23.284 --> 52:24.833
That's pretty good, Brick.

52:24.841 --> 52:26.519
- One more time, Travis.

52:26.514 --> 52:27.932
- Coach.

52:27.930 --> 52:29.369
- Don't bother, Grady,
you're off the team.

52:29.369 --> 52:30.827
- I need to talk to you for a minute.

52:30.829 --> 52:32.598
- Nothing to talk about,
Grady, you made your choice.

52:32.598 --> 52:34.985
- Coach, I caught the first plane back.

52:35.574 --> 52:38.551
I had to go, can't you understand that?

52:43.349 --> 52:45.536
Well, do you want me to beg?

52:47.377 --> 52:48.596
Do you want me to...

52:48.592 --> 52:50.160
Hey Frank!

52:51.714 --> 52:53.781
You want me to beg?

52:54.079 --> 52:55.307
Okay.

52:59.690 --> 53:01.448
I will beg.

53:03.467 --> 53:05.334
I need this.

53:05.874 --> 53:10.100
This is the only thing
I know I am good at.

53:11.628 --> 53:16.124
Don't take that away from me, please.

53:24.574 --> 53:26.263
- Don, line up the alternate.

53:26.267 --> 53:28.135
Who's next, Tommy?

53:37.761 --> 53:39.270
Tommy.

53:52.275 --> 53:55.272
- 53 mile per hour, 184 pounds pressure.

53:55.269 --> 53:56.847
- Where the hell do
you think you're going?

53:56.845 --> 53:58.483
We leave for the tournament in two days.

53:58.486 --> 54:00.205
You're still pulling punches.

54:00.202 --> 54:02.130
Holding back won't change a damn thing.

54:02.129 --> 54:05.166
If you want to be here,
you've got to give us 100%,

54:05.165 --> 54:06.483
no less.

54:06.486 --> 54:07.975
Now do it again.

54:08.320 --> 54:09.258
- Coach.

54:09.268 --> 54:11.426
- I said do it again.

54:28.799 --> 54:30.298
Do it!

54:41.191 --> 54:42.020
- Is he okay?

54:42.022 --> 54:43.480
- Don't know yet.

54:43.674 --> 54:45.053
Pulse is okay.

54:45.059 --> 54:46.588
Breathing.

55:03.461 --> 55:05.629
- Virgil, Virgil.

55:05.826 --> 55:06.895
- Hey, hey.

55:06.892 --> 55:08.251
Big stretch.

55:08.607 --> 55:10.185
- Hey, how are you, man?

55:10.184 --> 55:12.253
- He's just taking a break.

55:16.397 --> 55:17.326
- Tommy!

55:17.324 --> 55:18.942
- Let him go.

55:20.041 --> 55:21.379
- Virgil.

55:23.034 --> 55:24.764
He's all right.

55:25.261 --> 55:27.669
Virgil, you know where you are?

55:27.745 --> 55:29.943
Do you know where you are?

55:32.146 --> 55:33.884
- On the floor.

55:35.214 --> 55:38.081
- Hey, hey where you going?

55:39.000 --> 55:40.358
- How's your kid, Alex?

55:40.360 --> 55:41.779
- He's gonna be okay, thank god.

55:41.778 --> 55:42.817
Where are you going?

55:42.822 --> 55:44.121
- I'm quitting the team.

55:44.122 --> 55:45.450
- Bullshit.

55:45.444 --> 55:46.772
Why?

55:47.457 --> 55:48.576
- Because I can't fight Dae Han.

55:48.576 --> 55:49.185
- Why?

55:49.183 --> 55:51.431
- Because I can't fight Dae Han.

55:51.431 --> 55:53.679
- What are you talking about, man?

55:58.059 --> 56:01.776
- Dae Han killed my
brother in a tournament

56:01.778 --> 56:03.876
just like this one.

56:05.274 --> 56:07.721
- Why didn't you ever tell me this?

56:07.809 --> 56:08.898
- It wasn't your problem.

56:08.896 --> 56:10.284
- That's bullshit, man.

56:10.281 --> 56:11.441
- What do you want me to say?

56:11.443 --> 56:12.721
- Say something.

56:12.721 --> 56:14.479
- I want to kill the son of a bitch.

56:14.479 --> 56:15.839
- Then kill the son of a bitch.

56:15.833 --> 56:17.521
- Alex!

56:18.547 --> 56:20.755
I'm afraid.

56:22.586 --> 56:25.083
If you don't deal with this right now,

56:26.059 --> 56:27.928
you never will.

56:28.170 --> 56:30.936
You'll just shove it inside like I did.

56:30.983 --> 56:34.949
Melissa died and I just packed it in.

56:34.946 --> 56:39.161
I took all that pain
and I just packed it in.

56:40.721 --> 56:42.640
I was wrong.

56:43.322 --> 56:46.119
You are wrong.

56:47.381 --> 56:49.499
Your brother is gone, man.

56:49.555 --> 56:53.392
Melissa is gone.

56:56.265 --> 56:58.443
You need this fight bad.

56:58.442 --> 57:00.490
You need this fight for you, man.

57:00.488 --> 57:02.635
This is your chance.

57:03.549 --> 57:05.198
Don't blow it.

57:06.759 --> 57:08.447
That's all I got to say.

57:08.592 --> 57:10.690
Except you're an asshole.

57:35.689 --> 57:37.446
- Hey, what are you doing
in Coach Couzo's office?

57:37.446 --> 57:38.825
You're not supposed to be doing that.

57:38.821 --> 57:39.610
- What is it, Don?

57:39.609 --> 57:41.157
What is it I don't know?

57:41.166 --> 57:43.024
- I don't have the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

57:43.019 --> 57:44.827
- What is it about Tommy?

57:46.354 --> 57:47.473
- Look, I really think
you should leave here

57:47.473 --> 57:48.932
before Coach Couzo gets back.

57:48.933 --> 57:51.410
- Don, there's two pages
missing from Tommy's file.

57:51.416 --> 57:53.133
- Yeah, that's right, I can't discuss it.

57:53.131 --> 57:54.380
Look, I really think you should...

57:54.378 --> 57:56.397
- I'm not leaving until you tell me.

57:56.400 --> 57:57.349
- Oh boy.

57:57.347 --> 57:58.835
- You're not responsible for this.

57:58.838 --> 58:00.876
- Look, I know I'm not
responsible for this, Miss Wade,

58:00.873 --> 58:03.071
I just could lose my job because of it.

58:05.072 --> 58:08.249
Now, you did not get that from me, right?

58:08.343 --> 58:11.100
No, no, come on now, you
didn't get that from me.

58:13.841 --> 58:17.986
You know the enemy
is waiting in the ring

58:19.709 --> 58:23.176
Fate is riding on the fight

58:27.296 --> 58:31.581
You'll have to find a
way to keep a good man down

58:32.815 --> 58:36.791
He'll take the challenge
on with all his might

58:40.536 --> 58:44.981
Though a little part
is burning in his soul

58:46.358 --> 58:50.454
The thought of it is
heavy on your mind

58:57.632 --> 58:59.021
- Pick it up.

58:59.026 --> 59:00.704
- Why didn't you tell me about Tommy?

59:00.699 --> 59:02.647
This is how you deal
with people, Mr. Couzo.

59:02.648 --> 59:03.617
- What are you talking about?

59:03.618 --> 59:04.638
- You know what I'm talking about.

59:04.641 --> 59:06.029
I've just seen the videotape.

59:08.015 --> 59:09.233
- So?

59:09.230 --> 59:10.590
- So?

59:10.594 --> 59:12.961
How could you send him
to the ring with Dae Han?

59:12.959 --> 59:14.448
- Because Tommy's the
only fighter on this team

59:14.452 --> 59:16.780
who has a chance against
him and you know it.

59:16.775 --> 59:19.143
- So it's only about
winning then, is that it?

59:19.141 --> 59:21.149
Win at any cost, right coach?

59:21.154 --> 59:22.383
- Back off, Wade.

59:22.379 --> 59:23.378
I don't have to listen to this.

59:23.381 --> 59:24.470
- Yes you do, Frank.

59:24.468 --> 59:26.167
If you pull one more
stunt like you just pulled

59:26.163 --> 59:27.601
with Tommy, you won't
have to get on a plane

59:27.601 --> 59:30.938
because I will personally kick
your ass from here to Korea.

59:34.219 --> 59:36.656
None of this had to happen, Frank.

59:37.257 --> 59:39.934
Did you ever stop to think
what it might be like

59:39.929 --> 59:42.247
if you cared as much about these guys

59:42.251 --> 59:44.270
as you do about winning?

59:44.276 --> 59:47.074
- This has nothing to do with winning.

59:47.654 --> 59:50.492
If those boys do their best and fail,

59:50.489 --> 59:52.496
I'll still be proud.

59:52.811 --> 59:54.450
But if they don't give me their all

59:54.452 --> 59:56.590
and if I don't give them mine,

59:56.583 --> 01:00:00.220
that is my failure and my disgrace.

01:00:01.922 --> 01:00:04.739
Matter of fact, that's
exactly what happened

01:00:04.735 --> 01:00:06.373
to Tommy's brother.

01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:08.464
You saw that tape.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:11.941
I was the coach of that team, Miss Wade.

01:00:12.556 --> 01:00:15.564
I carried the burden of
his death for 15 years.

01:00:16.563 --> 01:00:18.480
Those boys didn't know what
they were getting into.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:19.936
I did.

01:00:20.672 --> 01:00:22.850
It was all just a game to them.

01:00:23.731 --> 01:00:26.638
I didn't know enough
then to give them rules,

01:00:26.639 --> 01:00:28.777
to drive them to the edge,
to the breaking point,

01:00:28.771 --> 01:00:30.729
to where they hated my guts.

01:00:30.998 --> 01:00:34.833
Tommy's brother died because I failed.

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.088
He was not prepared.

01:00:38.786 --> 01:00:43.293
And I will never let
that happen again, ever.

01:01:04.818 --> 01:01:05.917
- Coach.

01:01:06.735 --> 01:01:09.493
We, um, we need to talk to you.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:12.704
- I'm listening.

01:01:15.601 --> 01:01:19.936
- Coach, um, we all thought that...

01:01:19.935 --> 01:01:21.864
- What is it, Grasso?

01:01:22.236 --> 01:01:24.384
- Well, we uh...

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.877
- We hope you change your mind about Alex.

01:01:26.872 --> 01:01:28.010
- Since when did you give a rat's ass

01:01:28.013 --> 01:01:29.731
about anybody but you?

01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:31.296
- Since now.

01:01:33.319 --> 01:01:35.885
Coach, we need Alex

01:01:36.942 --> 01:01:39.549
and we need Tommy to win.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.808
- That all?

01:01:44.176 --> 01:01:45.515
- Yes sir.

01:01:45.871 --> 01:01:48.678
- Plane leaves tomorrow, 2000 hours.

01:01:58.026 --> 01:01:59.954
I'll be damned.

01:02:10.653 --> 01:02:12.292
- May I come in?

01:02:12.453 --> 01:02:14.031
Mr. Jennings, if you're going to fire me,

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.309
then damn it, fire me.

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:17.027
- Nobody's firing you yet.

01:02:17.933 --> 01:02:19.972
- Until I am relieved of my duties,

01:02:19.976 --> 01:02:22.254
I'll continue to make all decisions

01:02:22.246 --> 01:02:25.443
concerning the conduct of
this team as I see fit.

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:30.893
- Great, you're back!

01:02:33.658 --> 01:02:36.005
- That includes the
participation of Alex Grady.

01:02:36.009 --> 01:02:37.848
I have a lot to do before we leave, so

01:02:37.843 --> 01:02:39.610
if you don't mind.

01:03:36.669 --> 01:03:38.497
- Come on, boys, hop in.

01:03:49.023 --> 01:03:50.342
- You, Coach.

01:03:50.521 --> 01:03:51.759
- Tickets.

01:03:51.768 --> 01:03:53.056
- This way.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.758
Travis.

01:03:54.922 --> 01:03:55.971
Where's Virgil?

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:57.514
- He's in the bathroom.

01:03:58.939 --> 01:04:00.617
- Hey, what do you think?

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:01.878
- About what?

01:04:01.876 --> 01:04:03.754
- He shaved his beard.

01:04:03.759 --> 01:04:05.678
- It'll make me faster, don't you think?

01:04:05.958 --> 01:04:07.667
- Yeah.

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:16.294
- Tommy!

01:04:17.719 --> 01:04:18.807
- Coach, I, uh...

01:04:18.805 --> 01:04:21.403
- No apologies offered or accepted.

01:04:22.407 --> 01:04:23.875
Welcome back.

01:04:26.945 --> 01:04:29.002
- Thank you, sir.

01:04:29.363 --> 01:04:30.681
Yeah!

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.119
Hey, Virgil.

01:04:32.123 --> 01:04:33.132
- I'm all right.

01:04:33.124 --> 01:04:33.994
- I'm glad you're all right.

01:04:33.998 --> 01:04:35.177
- You kick hard.

01:04:36.757 --> 01:04:37.997
- Hey buddy, how you doing?

01:04:37.995 --> 01:04:39.523
- Here's your coat.

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:42.195
- I owe you one.

01:04:42.203 --> 01:04:43.172
- Yeah you do.

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:44.331
- Yeah.

01:04:45.655 --> 01:04:46.814
- It's good to have you back.

01:04:46.817 --> 01:04:48.235
- Good to be here.

01:04:48.231 --> 01:04:50.379
Sonny, Miss Wade.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:53.960
Travis.

01:05:23.232 --> 01:05:25.679
- Hello everybody, I'm
Ahmad Rashad and welcome

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:28.489
to Seoul, Korea and the Jamsil gymnasium

01:05:28.496 --> 01:05:30.054
for an invitation tournament between the

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:32.079
national teams of the Republic of Korea

01:05:32.075 --> 01:05:33.594
and the United States.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.827
This afternoon we'll be
watching the United States

01:05:35.826 --> 01:05:39.243
team under the leadership
of Coach Frank Couzo,

01:05:39.247 --> 01:05:41.415
himself a veteran of
this often perilous sport

01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:43.757
leading his youthful warriors
in a sport traditionally

01:05:43.753 --> 01:05:46.501
dominated by Asian powerhouses.

01:06:02.107 --> 01:06:05.344
- You've worked
very hard, all of you.

01:06:05.949 --> 01:06:09.846
You've grown as athletes and individuals.

01:06:10.542 --> 01:06:12.030
You've learned a lot.

01:06:12.428 --> 01:06:14.735
We've all learned a lot.

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:17.838
As Catherine might say, the teacher also

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:19.808
learns from the students.

01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:23.142
Today you have a chance to be the best

01:06:23.136 --> 01:06:25.644
martial artists in the world.

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:27.876
It's up to you.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.576
If you give everything
you've got, everything

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.407
with all your heart, you'll be winners.

01:06:39.173 --> 01:06:41.021
That I promise you.

01:06:42.284 --> 01:06:45.221
You can be the best of the best.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:58.107
- A capacity
crowd of 15,000 spectators

01:06:58.107 --> 01:07:00.795
has jammed Jamsil arena
for this traditional

01:07:00.793 --> 01:07:03.740
sporting event which is
held every three years.

01:07:04.106 --> 01:07:06.174
The pageantry you are witnessing shows the

01:07:06.174 --> 01:07:08.542
importance of Tae Kwon
Do to Korean heritage.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.767
They are as passionate
and wild about Tae Kwon Do

01:07:11.768 --> 01:07:14.125
as the Americans are about baseball.

01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:38.415
- And here they come
now, the United States

01:07:38.417 --> 01:07:41.154
national team, Coach
Couzo and the assistant

01:07:41.155 --> 01:07:43.643
coaches Catherine Wade and Don Peterson.

01:08:05.876 --> 01:08:07.984
- Grandma, I see him!

01:08:41.752 --> 01:08:43.310
- And now the Korean national team

01:08:43.308 --> 01:08:44.787
makes its entrance.

01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:07.264
- For you viewers new to the sport,

01:10:07.268 --> 01:10:09.066
this is a full contact match,

01:10:09.058 --> 01:10:11.026
the object of which is to win points or

01:10:11.029 --> 01:10:12.677
knock out your opponent.

01:10:12.681 --> 01:10:15.139
Styles include a
combination of Tae Kwon Do,

01:10:15.132 --> 01:10:17.629
Karate, Judo, and kickboxing.

01:10:17.635 --> 01:10:19.914
Each match consists of
three two minute rounds

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:23.073
with accumulated points
added to both side's totals.

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:25.711
- Hey Coach Wade.

01:10:26.281 --> 01:10:28.579
What's my son doing here?

01:10:32.233 --> 01:10:33.743
Thank you.

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:39.033
- We now direct your
attention to center stage

01:10:39.032 --> 01:10:41.120
for the first match of the afternoon.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.036
Yung Kim of Korea versus Sonny Grasso, a

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.147
second degree black belt
hailing from Detroit, Michigan.

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:50.068
Our referee is Mr. Chang
Park Kim, a veteran of the

01:10:50.071 --> 01:10:52.528
Korean Tae Kwon Do Association.

01:11:02.548 --> 01:11:04.377
And it looks like we're
about to get underway.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.669
The Americans heavy
underdogs against their

01:11:06.661 --> 01:11:08.620
Asian counterparts.

01:11:16.241 --> 01:11:17.090
- Come on, Sonny.

01:11:17.093 --> 01:11:17.702
- Come on, Sonny.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.740
- Come on!

01:11:26.393 --> 01:11:28.101
- Power counter!

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:34.442
- Point good!

01:11:37.111 --> 01:11:38.500
- Here in the
third and final round,

01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:41.784
Grasso is beginning to
fade, Yung Kim relentless.

01:11:42.318 --> 01:11:45.334
He lands with a vicious
jump spinning back kick!

01:11:51.177 --> 01:11:52.745
Grasso is down.

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.268
Korea takes the first match.

01:12:05.263 --> 01:12:08.690
The score stands Korea 11,
the United States seven.

01:12:10.356 --> 01:12:12.615
Here in round three,
Virgil Keller capitalizing

01:12:12.616 --> 01:12:15.961
on his speed and scores with
a spinning roundhouse kick.

01:12:41.694 --> 01:12:44.372
An elbow to the spine
and Keller is down again.

01:12:44.369 --> 01:12:46.127
- Come on, Virgil!

01:12:46.777 --> 01:12:48.745
- He appears to be dazed.

01:12:48.982 --> 01:12:51.659
- Stay focused, stay focused!

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.988
- That is the
end of the second match.

01:13:01.993 --> 01:13:04.810
The winner, Han Cho, giving
the Republic of Korea

01:13:04.806 --> 01:13:08.802
a total of 20 points
against nine for the USA.

01:13:10.207 --> 01:13:11.966
It's not a pretty sight,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:13:11.966 --> 01:13:13.304
Both fighters bloody.

01:13:13.308 --> 01:13:14.986
Travis Brickley of the
United States going on

01:13:14.982 --> 01:13:17.179
every last ounce of strength as he fights

01:13:17.188 --> 01:13:19.135
blow for blow with a seemingly exhausted

01:13:19.136 --> 01:13:20.735
Tung Sung Moon.

01:13:32.872 --> 01:13:34.660
- Come on, come on!

01:13:34.657 --> 01:13:35.567
Come on!

01:13:39.878 --> 01:13:42.375
- This partisan
crowd showing disapproval

01:13:42.382 --> 01:13:44.160
of Brickley's conduct.

01:13:47.308 --> 01:13:49.436
- Travis, behave yourself!

01:13:50.683 --> 01:13:52.222
- It's a full count, kimchi, and I'm going

01:13:52.218 --> 01:13:53.816
to hit home run on your fase, boy.

01:13:53.816 --> 01:13:55.484
- This might be exactly
what Brickley needed

01:13:55.484 --> 01:13:56.753
to fire him up.

01:13:56.752 --> 01:13:58.660
He scores heavily with a quick and sending

01:13:58.659 --> 01:13:59.998
Moon to the canvas.

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.670
It should be a score.

01:14:01.674 --> 01:14:03.622
Yes, it's all time of the three piece.

01:14:03.615 --> 01:14:05.363
An incredible comeback from Brickley.

01:14:05.361 --> 01:14:07.320
- USA!

01:14:13.427 --> 01:14:15.255
- A demonstration of
strength will determine the

01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:18.538
winner of the Travis Brickley,
Tung Sung Moon match.

01:14:18.531 --> 01:14:20.300
The fighter breaking
the most bricks will be

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.448
declared the victor.

01:14:58.967 --> 01:15:01.265
- It appears as
though Tung Sung Moon

01:15:01.257 --> 01:15:03.755
is using a very unorthodox technique,

01:15:03.761 --> 01:15:05.939
something called the ridge hand.

01:15:30.049 --> 01:15:32.866
- What are you counting them for?

01:15:34.875 --> 01:15:36.633
- Only one
concrete block separates

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:38.791
the fate of Brickley and Moon.

01:15:39.233 --> 01:15:40.182
- Tung.

01:15:40.181 --> 01:15:42.229
- But the match
goes to Tung Sung Moon.

01:15:42.227 --> 01:15:44.655
Now remember, this is a team competition

01:15:44.657 --> 01:15:46.865
where total points rather than individual

01:15:46.863 --> 01:15:49.890
match scores decide the overall winner.

01:15:50.784 --> 01:15:53.061
Coming up next, another
long shot, the veteran

01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:57.040
fighter on the team from
Portland, Oregon, Alex Grady.

01:16:01.865 --> 01:16:05.411
- Alex, it's up to you and me.

01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:07.188
You and me.

01:16:07.492 --> 01:16:10.090
- We're taking home the gold, Tommy.

01:16:10.986 --> 01:16:12.046
Yeah!

01:16:12.052 --> 01:16:13.491
- Do it!

01:16:13.491 --> 01:16:15.169
- This is a
real test for Alex Grady

01:16:15.164 --> 01:16:17.031
after a three year layoff
from the tournament

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:18.997
circuit he makes his comeback against

01:16:18.989 --> 01:16:21.467
Sae Jin Kwon, considered to be the top

01:16:21.471 --> 01:16:23.949
ranking fighter in his weight class.

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:26.899
- Watch the shoulder.

01:16:26.895 --> 01:16:27.944
You can take him, Alex.

01:16:27.939 --> 01:16:28.938
You've got the tools.

01:16:28.941 --> 01:16:29.660
- Yes sir.

01:16:29.665 --> 01:16:31.183
- Go get 'em.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.510
- This crowd is
really into this one,

01:16:37.516 --> 01:16:40.963
anticipating a major
battle between these two

01:16:40.957 --> 01:16:42.756
tough competitors.

01:16:45.923 --> 01:16:48.510
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:16:57.772 --> 01:16:59.001
- And here we go.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.708
Alex Grady measuring.

01:17:01.184 --> 01:17:03.592
Sae Jin Kwon attacks,
Grady counters with a down

01:17:03.592 --> 01:17:05.051
and scores.

01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:06.848
- Down, down, down!

01:17:06.843 --> 01:17:08.431
- For you, Travis.

01:17:08.579 --> 01:17:09.778
- Take that.

01:17:11.911 --> 01:17:14.359
- The Korean bounces right back.

01:17:15.327 --> 01:17:17.855
A point for the Korean team.

01:17:24.331 --> 01:17:26.009
In the earlier matches
today, the Koreans have

01:17:26.004 --> 01:17:28.711
built up a wide lead, but
because of this outstanding

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.919
performance by Alex Grady, the Americans

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:32.466
are closing the gap.

01:17:35.393 --> 01:17:38.749
But it is way too early
to write off Sae Jin Kwon.

01:17:51.354 --> 01:17:53.093
As we approach the end of round two,

01:17:53.091 --> 01:17:55.648
this match is really starting to heat up.

01:17:56.043 --> 01:17:58.560
Ooh, Sae Jin Kwon explodes with a vicious

01:17:58.567 --> 01:18:00.305
aerial back knuckle.

01:18:02.233 --> 01:18:04.441
As if this physical
confrontation weren't enough,

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.036
he seems to be taunting Grady.

01:18:17.244 --> 01:18:18.563
- You're mine.

01:18:29.601 --> 01:18:31.390
- No, no!

01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:41.492
- The athletes are
starting to lose their composure.

01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:43.907
Clearly both teams are
more determined to win,

01:18:43.908 --> 01:18:46.756
but that determination
doesn't affect the score.

01:18:46.785 --> 01:18:49.153
Alex Grady has thus far
defied the odds and is

01:18:49.151 --> 01:18:51.020
leading in the second
heaviest weight class

01:18:51.025 --> 01:18:52.633
of the competition.

01:18:57.425 --> 01:18:59.863
- Alex, when he comes in,

01:18:59.866 --> 01:19:02.723
side step and use your ridge hand.

01:19:03.063 --> 01:19:05.041
You're going to use your distance.

01:19:05.033 --> 01:19:07.072
Set him up and sweep him.

01:19:07.165 --> 01:19:08.024
- Yes sir.

01:19:08.027 --> 01:19:08.686
- Take it to him.

01:19:08.678 --> 01:19:09.777
- Yes sir.

01:19:21.408 --> 01:19:24.046
I'm gonna take your head off.

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.609
Thank you, folks.

01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:44.155
- With one minute remaining in the

01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:46.333
third round, both
athletes are landing some

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.706
incredible combinations,
although neither fighter

01:19:48.705 --> 01:19:51.292
seems able to seize the advantage.

01:20:01.641 --> 01:20:03.449
Grady is down.

01:20:03.961 --> 01:20:05.550
He's hurt.

01:20:08.951 --> 01:20:11.290
An injured shoulder forced Grady into

01:20:11.294 --> 01:20:12.623
retirement three years ago.

01:20:12.616 --> 01:20:15.963
It now appears he's re-injured
that very same shoulder.

01:20:18.785 --> 01:20:20.824
What a blow for the Americans.

01:20:20.821 --> 01:20:22.519
Alex Grady, hurt.

01:20:22.515 --> 01:20:24.952
If he can't continue,
the match will be forfeit

01:20:24.954 --> 01:20:26.963
and the American team
will lose the valuable

01:20:26.969 --> 01:20:29.356
points that Grady's earned so far.

01:20:29.473 --> 01:20:30.892
- You want to quit now?

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:32.258
- No, I don't know.

01:20:32.254 --> 01:20:33.643
- Two minutes.

01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:34.808
Two minutes.

01:20:34.810 --> 01:20:37.178
- Pop it, pop it, pop it.

01:20:37.176 --> 01:20:39.034
- Listen here, Alexander,
we can't let you go on.

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:40.099
Your shoulder's dislocated.

01:20:40.096 --> 01:20:41.605
We're going to have to stop
this thing, right coach?

01:20:41.608 --> 01:20:42.657
- You did your best, Alex.

01:20:42.654 --> 01:20:43.782
Catherine, take him to medical.

01:20:43.782 --> 01:20:44.781
- No!

01:20:44.784 --> 01:20:45.754
Pop it, Tommy.

01:20:45.754 --> 01:20:47.332
Shit, Tommy, pop it!

01:20:47.331 --> 01:20:48.979
- Forget it, Alex, it's over.

01:20:48.982 --> 01:20:51.900
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:20:58.541 --> 01:20:59.809
- Grandma!

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.089
- God damn it!

01:21:01.088 --> 01:21:02.526
Tape it up, tape it up.

01:21:02.526 --> 01:21:04.234
If I'm out, it's over.

01:21:04.241 --> 01:21:05.640
I can hold him off or 30 seconds.

01:21:05.636 --> 01:21:08.074
God damn it, I said tape it up!

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.369
- Ladies and
gentlemen, I've just been

01:21:09.367 --> 01:21:10.755
informed that there will
be a two minute injury

01:21:10.763 --> 01:21:13.620
time out to determine if
Alex Grady can continue.

01:21:13.618 --> 01:21:15.546
Now there's just 30
seconds left on the clock.

01:21:15.547 --> 01:21:17.605
If he can hold on, he keeps the points

01:21:17.603 --> 01:21:19.821
and the Americans are still in it.

01:21:20.022 --> 01:21:22.220
- Put your mind somewhere else.

01:21:22.217 --> 01:21:24.166
Let the pain go.

01:21:24.168 --> 01:21:26.085
There is no pain.

01:21:26.926 --> 01:21:28.875
There is no pain.

01:21:28.992 --> 01:21:30.959
- You got 30 seconds to go, Alex.

01:21:31.153 --> 01:21:33.142
You go out and do it.

01:21:33.792 --> 01:21:35.060
Let's get up.

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:40.333
- Yeah!

01:21:40.334 --> 01:21:41.773
- This is unbelievable.

01:21:41.773 --> 01:21:43.231
What a show of courage.

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.350
Alex Grady has reentered the ring.

01:21:45.342 --> 01:21:47.840
He intends to finish this fight.

01:21:58.075 --> 01:22:00.383
And Kwon immediately
attacks the left shoulder.

01:22:00.377 --> 01:22:02.325
Alex bravely pairing with his left hand,

01:22:02.327 --> 01:22:04.095
trying to keep Kwon at bay.

01:22:05.108 --> 01:22:07.785
Kwon attacks, Grady counters and scores.

01:22:09.349 --> 01:22:11.417
Oh, and Grady catches him with a jumping

01:22:11.416 --> 01:22:13.474
front kick that knocks Kwon!

01:22:13.481 --> 01:22:14.809
- Yes sir!

01:22:18.308 --> 01:22:19.577
- Yeah!

01:22:20.418 --> 01:22:21.556
- The buzzers sound.

01:22:21.557 --> 01:22:23.276
That is the end of the match.

01:22:23.273 --> 01:22:25.751
Alex Grady, injured shoulder and all,

01:22:25.756 --> 01:22:28.104
has defeated Sae Jin Kwon and managed

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:30.268
to keep the American hopes alive.

01:22:31.893 --> 01:22:34.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
we direct your attention

01:22:33.994 --> 01:22:36.980
to center ring for the final
match of the afternoon.

01:22:36.988 --> 01:22:41.033
Representing Korea at 175
pounds, the winner of the

01:22:41.025 --> 01:22:44.032
gold medals at the 1984 through the 1988

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:47.198
world games, Dae Han Park.

01:22:48.026 --> 01:22:51.582
For the United States team at 167 pounds,

01:22:51.575 --> 01:22:54.402
winner of a gold medal
at the 1988 invitational

01:22:54.409 --> 01:22:58.695
championship, from Fresno,
California, Tommy Lee.

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:03.589
- Tommy.

01:23:05.779 --> 01:23:06.989
- Yes sir?

01:23:07.779 --> 01:23:09.168
- Don't hold back.

01:23:09.175 --> 01:23:10.504
You can do it.

01:23:10.496 --> 01:23:11.904
- Yes sir.

01:23:20.491 --> 01:23:22.109
- And there's Dae
Han, the all time gold

01:23:22.111 --> 01:23:25.218
medal winner and heart and
soul of the Korean team.

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.153
If you had any doubt
about why he's the most

01:23:27.151 --> 01:23:30.078
feared fighter in the sport
today, just take a look.

01:23:45.617 --> 01:23:46.705
We're just about ready.

01:23:46.703 --> 01:23:49.381
America's hopes rest on Tommy Lee.

01:24:04.977 --> 01:24:06.626
Dae Han opens up quickly with a right to

01:24:06.628 --> 01:24:08.207
Tommy Lee's head.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.988
That is three unanswered
points by Dae Han.

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:29.039
This does not look like the same Tommy Lee

01:24:29.045 --> 01:24:31.802
that we saw in the North
American championships.

01:24:36.728 --> 01:24:38.517
Tommy Lee now on the attack, the veteran

01:24:38.507 --> 01:24:40.106
Dae Han countering.

01:24:44.475 --> 01:24:47.022
This spectacular aerial
display is the trademark

01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:49.019
of classical Tae Kwon Do.

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.938
Score, Tommy Lee with
an inside crescent kick.

01:24:52.933 --> 01:24:54.222
- All right!

01:25:00.893 --> 01:25:03.859
- Lee again with a
beautiful spinning heel kick.

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:05.314
- Tommy, yeah!

01:25:07.478 --> 01:25:09.925
- Folks, this Tommy
Lee is some kind of fighter.

01:25:09.918 --> 01:25:12.205
But the Americans may be
too far behind against

01:25:12.209 --> 01:25:14.436
a master like Dae Han.

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.458
- Yeah!

01:25:47.465 --> 01:25:49.663
Drop it like a toilet seat, Tommy!

01:25:55.915 --> 01:25:58.481
- Illegal hit, illegal hit!

01:25:58.482 --> 01:26:00.201
- Dae Han with
a kick to the groin.

01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:03.334
An illegal move even
in full contact karate.

01:26:08.297 --> 01:26:09.496
And there it is.

01:26:09.490 --> 01:26:12.147
The referee is giving Dae Han a warning.

01:26:12.228 --> 01:26:13.567
Illegal hit.

01:26:24.055 --> 01:26:26.972
- Coach, how many points to win?

01:26:26.975 --> 01:26:29.502
- Six or knockout.

01:26:30.086 --> 01:26:31.654
- Or a knockout.

01:26:31.844 --> 01:26:33.143
If he doesn't knock me out first.

01:26:33.145 --> 01:26:34.494
- You can do it.

01:26:55.489 --> 01:26:57.207
- Korean crowd is coming alive.

01:26:57.205 --> 01:26:59.452
Young support trying to bring Dae Han

01:26:59.452 --> 01:27:01.310
back into this match and crush any hope

01:27:01.306 --> 01:27:03.205
of an American upset.

01:27:04.994 --> 01:27:06.033
- Illegal hit, again!

01:27:06.527 --> 01:27:08.975
- It's another
illegal blow by Dae Han,

01:27:08.968 --> 01:27:10.836
but the referee didn't see it.

01:27:23.994 --> 01:27:25.373
What a move!

01:27:25.378 --> 01:27:27.326
A crushing blow by Tommy Lee to Dae Han.

01:27:27.328 --> 01:27:28.767
Is it possible?

01:27:28.767 --> 01:27:31.014
Can 26 year old Tommy Lee
bring the American team

01:27:31.014 --> 01:27:33.751
back from a seven point deficit?

01:27:33.774 --> 01:27:35.573
Score, Tommy Lee.

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.948
With a minute and a
half left on the clock,

01:27:37.951 --> 01:27:41.098
Tommy Lee has clearly taken
control of this fight.

01:27:41.521 --> 01:27:43.329
With the American team
trailing, the question now

01:27:43.331 --> 01:27:45.859
is there time for Lee
to score enough points

01:27:45.857 --> 01:27:48.195
for an American team victory?

01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:10.698
This could be it.

01:28:10.703 --> 01:28:12.052
This could be it!

01:28:12.046 --> 01:28:14.594
If he doesn't get up,
it's a technical knockout.

01:28:14.593 --> 01:28:17.240
The American team will
win this tournament!

01:29:06.389 --> 01:29:07.897
- No.

01:29:09.106 --> 01:29:11.294
- No, Tommy, no.

01:29:12.653 --> 01:29:15.081
Tommy, no, no!

01:29:15.273 --> 01:29:18.309
Coach, coach, he's gonna kill him!

01:29:18.309 --> 01:29:19.839
- No!

01:29:25.042 --> 01:29:26.550
- Why doesn't Lee finish him?

01:29:26.555 --> 01:29:28.194
A knockout would end it.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.415
What is going on?

01:29:29.408 --> 01:29:31.556
Dae Han is completely helpless and the

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.758
American will not finish him off.

01:30:36.103 --> 01:30:38.141
- You won that match.

01:30:39.074 --> 01:30:41.531
Don't ever forget that.

01:31:44.423 --> 01:31:45.861
- Just a minute,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:31:45.861 --> 01:31:47.620
there is something going on here.

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.778
Dae Han is making some sort of gesture

01:31:49.783 --> 01:31:51.561
to the American team.

01:32:00.843 --> 01:32:05.408
- To save a life in defeat

01:32:06.778 --> 01:32:11.773
is to earn victory and honor within.

01:32:14.482 --> 01:32:19.477
Your brother too was a great fighter.

01:32:21.004 --> 01:32:25.999
I deeply regret your loss

01:32:27.535 --> 01:32:30.273
and I offer myself

01:32:31.232 --> 01:32:33.890
as your brother.

01:33:27.589 --> 01:33:32.584
- Alexander Grady, Portland, Oregan.

01:33:36.198 --> 01:33:40.534
I know everything about you.

01:34:00.024 --> 01:34:03.410
- Sae Jin Kwon, Seoul, Korea,

01:34:04.244 --> 01:34:07.091
I know all I ever want to know about you.

01:35:04.464 --> 01:35:08.399
We started off heading for the top

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:12.267
and set our sights on the sun

01:35:13.903 --> 01:35:17.929
There's no more tears,
now we're standing here

01:35:18.101 --> 01:35:22.297
and the morning light has begun.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.426
They said that you'll expire

01:35:27.628 --> 01:35:31.514
You're wasting your time to try

01:35:33.063 --> 01:35:38.057
But inside a heart of fire
is a force you can't deny

01:35:42.567 --> 01:35:47.561
Something so strong
driving me on, never tire

01:35:52.264 --> 01:35:56.899
Something so strong, born of the sun

01:35:57.271 --> 01:36:02.267
Like a fire burns inside me so strong

01:36:10.314 --> 01:36:14.409
We live in hope, waiting for the day

01:36:14.533 --> 01:36:18.978
When all our dreams can begin

01:36:19.541 --> 01:36:23.507
The time it takes for the rain to fall

01:36:23.793 --> 01:36:28.069
Is the time it takes to give in

01:36:29.355 --> 01:36:33.292
They said that you'll expire

01:36:33.372 --> 01:36:37.208
You're wasting your time to try

01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:43.216
Inside a heart of fire
is a force you can't deny

01:36:48.498 --> 01:36:53.493
Something so strong
driving me on, never tire

01:36:57.864 --> 01:37:02.589
Something so strong, born of the sun

01:37:03.303 --> 01:37:08.298
Like a fire, sea of fire,
burns inside me so strong
