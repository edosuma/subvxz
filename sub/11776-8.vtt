<i>Previously</i> <i>on</i> <i>Ink Master...</i>

00:03.670 --> 00:05.296
Welcome to New York City.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.591
[narrator] <i> Ten of the best</i>
<i>tattoo artists on the planet</i>

00:08.675 --> 00:11.553
<i>have been competing</i>
<i>to determine who's number one.</i>

00:11.636 --> 00:12.429
[screams]

00:12.512 --> 00:14.681
{\an5}-[Dave] These are your canvases.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.681
-Wow.

00:14.764 --> 00:16.099
[narrator]
<i>Their skills</i> <i>have been tested</i>

00:16.181 --> 00:18.101
<i>in every essential discipline...</i>

00:18.184 --> 00:18.810
Holy [bleep].

00:18.893 --> 00:20.770
[narrator] <i> ...raw talent...</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.105
Go hard or go home.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.440
[crying] No, I can't! I can't!

00:23.523 --> 00:24.274
[Jeremy] <i> It sucks that</i>
<i>I got stuck</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.276
with this girl
for my first client.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.861
[bleep]

00:27.944 --> 00:29.821
This is a real
[bleep] debacle here today.

00:29.904 --> 00:30.780
[narrator] <i> ...line...</i>

00:30.864 --> 00:33.074
[Heather]
This [bleep] is hard to do.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.242
You want me to [bleep] judge

00:34.325 --> 00:35.493
from this little [bleep]
you did?

00:35.577 --> 00:37.162
Seriously, Heather,
did you think

00:37.245 --> 00:39.038
you were coming here
and not gonna be thrown

00:39.122 --> 00:40.623
<i>into some weird challenges?</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:41.958
<i>It's not gonna be easy. Period.</i>

00:42.333 --> 00:43.251
{\an8}[Bleep]

00:44.377 --> 00:45.920
{\an8}My clients are gonna be
the death of me.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.338
[narrator] <i> ...shading...</i>

00:47.422 --> 00:49.799
I'll say that ear looks
more like a Dorito chip

00:49.883 --> 00:51.301
than a tiger ear.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.470
You got elements
of the [bleep] thing wrong!

00:53.553 --> 00:54.637
{\an5}-Bull [bleep]!

00:53.553 --> 00:54.637
-Just be real!

00:54.721 --> 00:55.472
If it was me,
I'd be real!

00:55.555 --> 00:56.222
I'd be, like,
"Yo, I [bleep] up!"

00:58.141 --> 00:59.809
[narrator]
<i>...technical precision...</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:01.770
[Dave] <i> Clock starts now.</i>

01:01.853 --> 01:03.480
This is gonna suck.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.397
Bring it on, I know you guys
are gonna tear me up.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.817
[Chris] <i> This is a really,</i>
<i>really bad tattoo from you.</i>

01:07.901 --> 01:09.194
You're competing
for 100 grand,

01:09.277 --> 01:12.655
and you're gonna do something
that's on somebody forever.

01:14.324 --> 01:14.824
[narrator] <i> ...color...</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:16.075
[James] [bleep] me.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.329
{\an5}-You're not hitting it.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.329
-I disagree entirely.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.538
[Chris]
<i>It's a traditional tattoo</i>

01:20.622 --> 01:22.832
that has balls, and you cut
the balls off it.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.292
[narrator] <i> ...proportion...</i>

01:24.375 --> 01:25.376
What happened here?

01:25.460 --> 01:26.336
Uh, you ask that
like it was a negative thing.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.630
[Dave] <i> The face, to me,</i>
<i>she looks like</i>

01:28.713 --> 01:30.215
she's just been
in a prize fight.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.968
I cannot believe
her left hand... Jesus!

01:34.052 --> 01:36.679
It looks like she just pulled it
out of the garbage disposal.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.516
I want to see competition.
I want to see a star.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.559
I want to see somebody shine.
I haven't seen it.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.728
The judges have decided.

01:44.062 --> 01:44.395
B-Tat,

01:44.479 --> 01:46.189
Jeremy,

01:46.272 --> 01:48.149
Al Fliction, Heather,

01:48.233 --> 01:49.400
Billy, Lea,

01:50.151 --> 01:51.110
Josh,

01:51.194 --> 01:52.821
you don't have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.616
[narrator]
<i>Tonight on the season finale</i>

01:56.699 --> 01:58.910
of <i> Ink Master...</i>

01:58.993 --> 02:00.995
<i>three artists remain.</i>

02:01.079 --> 02:02.163
<i>James,</i>

02:02.247 --> 02:03.164
<i>Tommy,</i>

02:03.248 --> 02:04.123
<i>and Shane.</i>

02:04.207 --> 02:07.877
<i>Only one will earn</i>
<i>$100,000 prize</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:11.047
<i>and the title of</i> Ink Master.

02:11.756 --> 02:12.715
[theme music playing]

02:53.673 --> 02:56.676
On the bright side, dude,
final three, man.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.636
Final three.
On the bright side.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.722
[Tommy] So you really think,
is Josh coming back?

03:00.805 --> 03:03.892
<i>It doesn't have</i>
<i>that real natural look to it.</i>

03:03.975 --> 03:06.519
<i>The eyes and the hair</i>
<i>kill it so bad for me.</i>

03:06.603 --> 03:07.687
<i>It's just off.</i>

03:07.770 --> 03:09.772
[Shane] Yeah, I definitely think
Josh is coming back.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.399
I [bleep] hope so.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.942
James did two left feet, dude.

03:13.026 --> 03:13.985
What?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.321
[Oliver] <i> For real,</i>
<i>this is a mistake, man.</i>

03:16.404 --> 03:17.447
[Shane]
How could you put somebody

03:17.530 --> 03:19.115
in the final three
if you did two left feet?

03:19.198 --> 03:22.160
<i>Mr. Vaughn,</i>
<i>you made it to the finale.</i>

03:22.243 --> 03:22.660
[exhales deeply] [chuckles]

03:22.744 --> 03:24.454
<i>You up for this?</i>

03:25.371 --> 03:25.997
All the time.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.790
[Shane] I'd [bleep] my pants

03:27.874 --> 03:28.249
if James comes
through that door, dude.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.924
{\an5}-[screams]

03:33.922 --> 03:35.924
-[Tommy] Whoa!

03:36.007 --> 03:37.550
[Shane] Holy [bleep]!

03:37.634 --> 03:40.219
{\an8}Lord, have mercy,
I dodged a big bullet this time.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.387
<i>The last two critiques</i>
<i>were really bad,</i>

03:41.471 --> 03:44.432
and this two-weeks-in-a-row crap
is really not cool.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.059
[Shane] I just said,
"I'm gonna [bleep] my pants

03:46.142 --> 03:48.311
if James comes
through that door."

03:48.394 --> 03:50.688
[James] My heart is beating
like a goddamn rabid ape.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.190
[Shane laughs]

03:52.273 --> 03:53.399
{\an5}-[Shane] Holy [bleep], man.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.399
-[James] Lord, have mercy.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.614
[Shane] <i> I know I should be, lik,</i>
<i>super fired up,</i>

03:59.697 --> 04:01.074
<i>jumping around</i>
<i>to be in the final three,</i>

04:01.157 --> 04:01.950
{\an8}but I'm, like, more focused now.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.451
{\an8}I mean, now it's right there.

04:03.534 --> 04:07.288
<i>Like, I just gotta reach out</i>
<i>and take the 100 grand.</i>

04:07.372 --> 04:09.415
{\an8}Super excited about making it
to the final three.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.166
<i>I have a hard fight here,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

04:10.249 --> 04:12.669
<i>I got two serious competitors.</i>

04:12.752 --> 04:14.128
<i>It's a little challenging</i>
<i>right now.</i>

04:14.212 --> 04:15.171
[James] I can't eat.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.839
Can't think.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.882
{\an8}I came to <i> Ink Master</i>
because I wanna win.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.511
<i>I want to show the world</i>
<i>who I am, what I can do,</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:22.428
and win this contest.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.722
[Tommy] You have color
in your face.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.765
You didn't have color
in your face before. [chuckles]

04:25.848 --> 04:28.726
Well, dude, I was dead.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.269
You made it out.
You made it to the finals.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.062
That's it.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.563
It's just three of us now.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.158
Congratulations, guys,

04:44.242 --> 04:46.869
you've made it
to the final three.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.205
But only one of you
is to be named Ink Master.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.290
But before that happens,

04:51.374 --> 04:53.876
your toughest
challenge yet awaits.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.962
This week there will be
no Flash Challenge.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.756
The judges have selected
a master canvas for each of you

04:58.840 --> 05:00.133
based on your portfolios

05:00.216 --> 05:01.926
and the work
that you've done here.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.720
You'll get
two six-hour sittings

05:03.803 --> 05:05.179
with your master canvas.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.598
[James] <i> A 12-hour tattoo</i>
<i>with the speed that I have...</i>

05:07.682 --> 05:10.268
{\an8}I'm really, really stoked
on this 'cause I am fast.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.146
Now, this may be
the most important tattoo

05:13.229 --> 05:14.564
you ever design.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.690
[Oliver] <i> When</i>
<i>making the selection</i>

05:15.773 --> 05:17.066
<i>for these master canvases,</i>

05:17.150 --> 05:19.235
{\an8}we really wanted to give them
something that they'd be into.

05:19.318 --> 05:21.738
<i>We didn't want this to be</i>
<i>one of those tricky challenges</i>

05:21.821 --> 05:23.281
<i>where you have to do something</i>
<i>that's not really your style.</i>

05:23.364 --> 05:26.659
No excuse for it
not to be the kickass tattoo.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.036
So let's meet
your canvases.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.418
[Shane] <i> I'm nervous as hell.</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:37.462
{\an8}I know James is gonna do
something ridiculously huge

05:37.545 --> 05:39.338
{\an8}in 12 hours
'cause he's lightning fast.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.591
<i>So that'll be tough</i>
<i>to compete against.</i>

05:41.674 --> 05:42.925
[Dave] James, meet Diana.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.470
She's really interested
in Japanese half-sleeve,

05:45.553 --> 05:47.638
and we all agree
that we really want to see

05:47.722 --> 05:48.639
what you can do with this.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.682
Awesome.

05:49.766 --> 05:50.641
{\an8}I'm very, very excited for this.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.394
<i>She wants exactly</i>
<i>what I love to do.</i>

05:53.478 --> 05:56.189
<i>I do big,</i>
<i>traditional-style Japanese.</i>

05:56.272 --> 05:58.149
<i>It's right up my alley.</i>

05:58.232 --> 06:00.193
And Tommy,
that's Brandon.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.110
Brandon's looking
for a grim reaper

06:01.194 --> 06:02.445
{\an5}on the back.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.445
-Awesome.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.490
Seems like it's something you'll
really be able to get into

06:05.573 --> 06:07.325
'cause he wants dark and heavy,

06:07.408 --> 06:08.159
no specific style, really.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.369
{\an8}I'm super-psyched
about the canvas

06:10.453 --> 06:11.788
{\an8}that the judges gave to me.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.164
<i>I'm a very well-rounded artist.</i>

06:13.247 --> 06:14.999
<i>I don't necessarily</i>
<i>have a style.</i>

06:15.083 --> 06:18.419
<i>I have to put together something</i>
<i>totally shocking and insane.</i>

06:18.503 --> 06:20.129
Shane, meet Mark.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.340
[Chris] This was
a tough one for me

06:22.423 --> 06:24.967
because we decide on
who should get what

06:25.051 --> 06:26.594
and who would be
the most suiting.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.012
And obviously, James,

06:28.096 --> 06:30.306
you know, we gave you
the big Japanese.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.475
And this was another
Japanese-style tattoo.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.143
but this one's gonna be
a lot more statuesque.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.978
Let's see what you can do.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.022
[Shane] <i> What the [bleep], man?</i>

06:38.106 --> 06:39.440
{\an8}I'm a little frustrated.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.109
<i>I do portraits and realism.</i>

06:41.192 --> 06:42.276
<i>I don't do Japanese.</i>

06:42.360 --> 06:43.402
<i>It's not my thing.</i>

06:43.486 --> 06:44.403
[Dave] There you have it.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.780
You'll have
the rest of the afternoon

06:45.863 --> 06:46.906
to consult
with your master canvases.

06:46.989 --> 06:50.326
And tomorrow you'll have
your first six-hour session.

06:50.409 --> 06:50.535
Good luck to you guys.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.748
[Chris] <i> Shane, Tommy, and James</i>
<i>have made it here</i>

06:55.832 --> 06:56.916
{\an8}because of their line work,
their shading,

06:56.999 --> 06:59.669
{\an8}their technical precision,
their skills as tattooers.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.879
<i>Now this is where</i>
<i>they really have to show off.</i>

07:01.963 --> 07:03.756
This tattoo has to be

07:03.840 --> 07:08.136
<i>what really sets them apart</i>
<i>from the other two competitors.</i>

07:08.219 --> 07:11.889
It's what's gonna make
this competition come to a head.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.267
[Diana] I'm looking to get
a Japanese-style

07:14.350 --> 07:16.018
{\an6}-koi fish.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.018
-Oh, I love you.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.436
[James] <i> I'm in my comfort zone.</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:20.398
{\an8}If the judges judge this tattoo
over anything that Shane does,

07:20.481 --> 07:21.774
<i>I'll be able</i>
<i>to come on top.</i>

07:21.858 --> 07:23.526
I don't want to, you know,
do something small.

07:23.609 --> 07:27.029
I normally can do
a half-sleeve in six hours.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.365
{\an5}-So... [laughs]

07:27.113 --> 07:29.365
-[Diana] Mmm. Oh, okay, cool.

07:29.448 --> 07:30.491
I was looking to do
a battle-ridden

07:30.575 --> 07:33.536
{\an5}-Viking grim reaper pretty much.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.536
-[Tommy] Sick!

07:33.619 --> 07:36.038
{\an8}As an Ink Master you should
be able to conquer any canvas,

07:36.122 --> 07:38.457
{\an8}so I think even if they sat back
and shuffled all three of them

07:38.541 --> 07:41.002
{\an8}and gave them back out,
and we all got different ones,

07:41.085 --> 07:43.212
{\an8}each person should be able
to conquer the piece they get.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.173
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
put it over to the one side

07:45.256 --> 07:46.549
of your shoulder,
'cause obviously I can't do

07:46.632 --> 07:47.133
a back piece in 12 hours.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.843
[Brandon] Obviously.

07:49.719 --> 07:50.386
[Mark] Buddhas and lotus.

07:50.469 --> 07:51.345
[Shane] <i> This is bull [bleep].</i>

07:51.429 --> 07:53.264
{\an8}I got thrown,
like, a Japanese twist.

07:53.347 --> 07:57.059
You can do a Buddha
both ways, like,

07:57.143 --> 07:58.060
with some bold part
to the outline,

07:58.144 --> 08:00.438
so it stands out,
or you can do it, like...

08:00.521 --> 08:02.023
We make it look
like a statue.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.900
Like, dead-on realistic.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.277
I feel like James and Tommy
both got handed

08:06.360 --> 08:07.195
<i>exactly what they do,</i>

08:07.278 --> 08:09.238
<i>and I'm threatened.</i>

08:09.322 --> 08:10.781
<i>Nothing's guaranteed,</i>
<i>that's for sure.</i>

08:17.663 --> 08:19.665
{\an5}-[girl over phone] <i> Daddy?</i>

08:17.663 --> 08:19.665
-[James] Hey, baby.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.917
{\an8}I'm a single father.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.461
<i>I now have full custody</i>
<i>of my two daughters.</i>

08:23.544 --> 08:24.128
What did you
have for breakfast?

08:24.212 --> 08:27.256
[girl] <i> Waffles and syrup.</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:28.257
[James] Waffles with syrup?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.343
You remember when daddy
made you blue eggs?

08:30.426 --> 08:31.385
[girl laughs]

08:32.053 --> 08:33.136
[James] You silly.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.056
It's hard being away.

08:35.139 --> 08:35.514
Daddy's got to go to work.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.517
I wanna provide.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.102
<i>In the end it'll be worth it.</i>

08:40.186 --> 08:42.772
{\an5}-[James] I love you, boo-boo.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.772
<i>-</i> [girl] <i> I love you more, Daddy.</i>

08:42.855 --> 08:44.232
{\an5}-Love you, bye.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.232
-[girl] <i> Love you, bye.</i>

08:44.315 --> 08:45.107
[phone beeps]

08:45.191 --> 08:45.733
[James]
<i>I definitely need to win.</i>

08:49.570 --> 08:50.613
[Dave] Gentlemen,

08:50.696 --> 08:52.448
welcome to your
first master canvas session.

08:52.531 --> 08:57.036
Don't forget
one of you will be taking home

08:57.119 --> 09:00.456
$100,000 and the title
of Ink Master.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.208
You have six hours
to do this work,

09:02.291 --> 09:05.127
and your time begins now.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.258
{\an8}What's different about
this master canvas tattoo

09:10.341 --> 09:11.259
<i>is they have 12 hours.</i>

09:11.342 --> 09:13.094
<i>They should be</i>
<i>able</i> <i>to have the time</i>

09:13.177 --> 09:15.888
<i>to really put the detail in,</i>
<i>really put the time in,</i>

09:15.972 --> 09:17.557
and do the best tattoo possible.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.683
{\an5}-It's beautiful, yeah.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.683
-[Shane] Cool, cool.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.479
It's like, "Thank God
I get to actually show

09:23.562 --> 09:25.856
exactly what I do
in my business."

09:25.940 --> 09:29.568
[Chris] <i> James is a big,</i>
<i>rock-solid badass tattooer.</i>

09:29.652 --> 09:31.696
{\an8}The only problem
I think that James has

09:31.779 --> 09:35.074
{\an8}<i>is he puts a little bit too much</i>
<i>into everything.</i>

09:35.157 --> 09:37.702
{\an8}<i>Slow it down, hit it,</i>
<i>be clean about it,</i>

09:37.785 --> 09:38.828
{\an8}<i>and really impress us.</i>

09:38.911 --> 09:41.664
{\an8}<i>Because James can do</i>
<i>anything he wants to do.</i>

09:41.747 --> 09:43.165
{\an8}<i>He's that type of tattooer.</i>

09:43.249 --> 09:44.166
[exhales deeply]

09:45.084 --> 09:47.003
[tattoo gun buzzing]

09:47.086 --> 09:47.586
[Tommy]
I just gotta move through it

09:47.670 --> 09:49.088
because it's a big one

09:49.171 --> 09:50.798
to get done in 12 hours,
you know?

09:50.881 --> 09:54.010
[Oliver] <i> Tommy is just</i>
<i>a working man's tattooer.</i>

09:54.093 --> 09:55.511
{\an8}He prides himself
on being able to do

09:55.594 --> 09:56.804
{\an8}whatever people want.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.264
{\an8}<i>Throughout this competition,</i>
<i>Tommy has really shined</i>

09:58.347 --> 10:00.391
{\an8}<i>in a lot of areas.</i>

10:00.474 --> 10:02.560
{\an8}<i>He's a solid tattooer,</i>
<i>his weaknesses have been</i>

10:02.643 --> 10:03.978
{\an8}<i>a little bit</i>
<i>in his artistry.</i>

10:04.061 --> 10:06.188
{\an8}<i>He's lost it on proportion</i>
<i>a few times.</i>

10:06.272 --> 10:07.690
{\an8}<i>More artistic losses</i>
<i>than technical losses.</i>

10:12.153 --> 10:14.030
[Shane] This is not
a long sitting for me.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.033
But it's what they expect you
to accomplish in that sitting

10:17.116 --> 10:19.118
that is [bleep] realistic.

10:19.201 --> 10:23.080
{\an8}Shane has a very strong
black and gray fundamental.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.041
{\an8}<i>He's a great portrait tattooer.</i>

10:25.124 --> 10:26.292
{\an8}<i>He's technically precise.</i>

10:26.375 --> 10:28.586
{\an8}<i>He's really good at picking out</i>
<i>the little nuances</i>

10:28.669 --> 10:30.338
{\an8}<i>that make a tattoo pop</i>

10:30.421 --> 10:32.048
{\an8}<i>and accentuating them</i>
<i>on the skin.</i>

10:32.131 --> 10:34.175
{\an8}<i>It's hard to take anything</i>
<i>away from Shane, he's good.</i>

10:36.427 --> 10:36.677
Three down, three to go.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.602
{\an8}Some of us in this competition
have problems with,

10:44.685 --> 10:48.647
{\an8}you know, dealing with
on-the-spot pressure.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.776
{\an8}I'm catered to it,
you know, 'cause I like it.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.735
{\an8}I'm confident
I can get this done.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.363
<i>I got lightning</i>
<i>in a tattoo machine.</i>

10:55.446 --> 10:56.447
it will pop off.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.406
[Shane] <i> James is a madman,</i>

10:57.490 --> 10:58.407
{\an8}trying to accomplish
a ton of work

10:58.491 --> 11:00.576
<i>in a short amount of time.</i>

11:00.659 --> 11:01.827
<i>The drawing looks great,</i>

11:01.911 --> 11:04.455
<i>his true Japanese skills</i>
<i>are showing through.</i>

11:04.538 --> 11:05.414
If he finishes it,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.083
Tommy and I
could really be in trouble.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.210
Five down.
that's one hour left, people.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.588
Are you happy with this?

11:12.671 --> 11:16.425
I went home
to the Brownstone last night,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.135
worked until 4:00
in the morning on it.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.845
Woke up at 7:00

11:19.929 --> 11:21.764
and then finished it
by 2:00 today.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.141
Hey, man, at the end of the day,
it's 100 grand.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.309
That's why
I was up all night.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.560
{\an8}I'm realizing now
that I've designed a tattoo

11:26.644 --> 11:29.313
{\an8}that is way over
the time constraint.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.981
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I'm way behind schedule.</i>

11:31.065 --> 11:33.984
I gotta keep on my game,
you know what I'm saying, kid?

11:34.068 --> 11:35.694
You got Tommy helm
to worry about, my man.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.697
[Dave]
Alright, guys, 30 minutes left

11:38.781 --> 11:40.658
to your first
master canvas session.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.123
<i>[Shane] My only concern</i>

11:45.329 --> 11:47.123
<i>is that the Buddha and lotus,</i>

11:47.206 --> 11:49.625
<i>even done perfect,</i>

11:49.708 --> 11:51.669
{\an8}it's just not
as impressive as, like,

11:51.752 --> 11:53.921
<i>practically a full sleeve</i>
<i>that James is working on.</i>

11:54.004 --> 11:54.880
<i>And that girl's sitting</i>
<i>like a freaking rock</i>

11:54.964 --> 11:56.382
<i>so I know that</i>
<i>he's gonna finish it.</i>

11:56.465 --> 11:58.175
[Dave] Five minutes.

12:01.429 --> 12:06.475
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.060
That's it, time's up.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.980
Machines down, no more ink.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.691
[James] I'm stoked.
I'm happy with what I got done.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.609
{\an8}I think it laid out
really well.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.654
<i>♪ I found my thrill ♪</i>

12:18.737 --> 12:21.282
<i>♪ Tattooing beautiful ladies ♪</i>

12:22.992 --> 12:24.952
{\an8}I am definitely behind.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.204
I am so excited
to see this.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.664
[Shane] <i> When I see</i>
<i>the other guys' tattoos,</i>

12:28.747 --> 12:31.083
{\an8}I know that
it's getting really serious.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.168
<i>They're coming out awesome.</i>

12:34.253 --> 12:35.212
<i>I'm worried.</i>

12:37.298 --> 12:38.757
{\an8}I have a surprise for you.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.342
[laughs] Oh, my God.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.927
I knew it wasn't [bleep] over.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.180
This is what it all
comes down to, this is it.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.681
Somebody's leaving
with 100 grand,

12:45.764 --> 12:47.141
and two people are just leaving.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.526
[Tommy] How do you guys feel
about your stuff?

12:57.610 --> 12:58.861
[James] I feel good.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.654
[Shane] Yeah, you couldn't have
been handed a better setup, man.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.240
Like, exactly
what you like to do.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.241
James is bringing his A-game

13:04.325 --> 13:05.701
and I'm gonna really have
to work hard,

13:05.784 --> 13:07.870
or he could pull this title
right out from underneath me.

13:07.953 --> 13:08.871
As soon as he said, like,

13:08.954 --> 13:09.955
<i>"Buddha and lotus,</i>
<i>Japanese-style"</i>

13:10.039 --> 13:12.791
I was, like, "Dude,
that ain't my [bleep] at all."

13:12.875 --> 13:14.001
{\an5}-Why's that?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.001
-[Shane] The guy never said

13:14.084 --> 13:15.628
he wanted it statuesque,

13:15.711 --> 13:18.005
I kind of, like,
just went in that direction.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.048
<i>Shane is kind of taking</i>
<i>the comfortable route,</i>

13:19.131 --> 13:21.675
and each piece has really met up
with what he does

13:21.759 --> 13:23.344
typically at home.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.970
[Shane] This is
all I'm getting for the final.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.388
I gotta go with what I do

13:26.472 --> 13:28.057
and try and do some realism
in there.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.059
That's the <i> Ink Master,</i>
you have to be able to do...

13:30.142 --> 13:31.685
You have to be
able to conquer it all.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.400
Alright, guys,
six hours down, six to go.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.028
Your time... starts now.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.405
[Tommy] We're ready, kid.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.866
{\an8}These three are the last men
standing for a reason.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.077
<i>They have proven</i>
<i>throughout each challenge</i>

13:48.160 --> 13:49.537
<i>that they are confident</i>
<i>and they have what it takes</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:50.788
<i>to take it to the limit.</i>

13:50.871 --> 13:54.124
For being one shot,
we got a lot done.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.376
[Chris] <i> The winner of Ink Master</i>

13:55.459 --> 13:58.087
{\an8}has to be the person
that is the most savvy

13:58.170 --> 13:59.588
in all fields,
<i>in all different areas</i>

13:59.672 --> 14:02.299
<i>that this competition has gone.</i>

14:02.383 --> 14:04.260
<i>I'm looking</i>
<i>for overall performance,</i>

14:04.343 --> 14:06.637
and I'm looking for who's gonna
wow me in this finale.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.266
[Mark] So have you been
enjoying the competition?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.309
[Shane]
Yeah, it's been pretty cool.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.103
{\an8}This is the final challenge.
I mean, this is it.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.355
{\an8}Like, this seals the deal,
so I gotta go for it.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.983
<i>I plan on doing a lot of detail</i>
<i>and really smooth shading,</i>

14:19.066 --> 14:19.942
and it takes time.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.902
<i>I gotta try and tattoo fast.</i>

14:22.861 --> 14:26.574
{\an8}I have almost six layers
in this tattoo.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.535
<i>Top water to bottom water,</i>

14:29.618 --> 14:32.538
<i>to koi fish, to flowers.</i>

14:32.621 --> 14:34.748
{\an8}You know, It's pretty busy,
the one James is doing.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.959
<i>But either way it's impressive,</i>
<i>like, it's big.</i>

14:37.042 --> 14:39.795
{\an8}I'm glad I'm in the finals
with this tattoo

14:39.878 --> 14:42.381
<i>and I really think</i>
<i>this is one tattoo</i>

14:42.464 --> 14:44.008
<i>that can actually</i>
<i>take down Shane.</i>

14:44.091 --> 14:45.217
That's three hours left.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.802
You got three down,
three to go.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.975
[Brandon] The blade just hurts,
like, ten times more

14:53.058 --> 14:54.685
than I've ever felt in my life.

14:54.768 --> 14:55.978
[Tommy] <i> My client is totally</i>
<i>struggling right now.</i>

14:56.061 --> 14:59.315
{\an8}He's levitating off the table
every time I hit him

14:59.398 --> 15:00.566
{\an8}with the tattoo machine.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.652
<i>Been working on him</i>
<i>for six hours previous to this.</i>

15:03.736 --> 15:06.071
<i>He's still bruised underneath,</i>
<i>it's not totally healed.</i>

15:06.155 --> 15:07.906
[Brandon] My back is just
starting to [bleep].

15:07.990 --> 15:10.576
I really don't have
that much time left,

15:10.659 --> 15:11.744
<i>and I have a lot more work</i>
<i>than planned.</i>

15:11.827 --> 15:15.164
{\an5}-[Tommy] Hold on.

15:11.827 --> 15:15.164
-[Brandon] Ooh.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.373
[Tommy] Yahtzee.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.250
[Tommy] <i> Everything's on the line</i>
<i>with this tattoo,</i>

15:18.334 --> 15:19.710
<i>and I hope I pull it off.</i>

15:21.128 --> 15:22.713
Fifteen minutes to go.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.551
[Tommy] Almost there, man.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.428
We're almost at the end
of this whole entire thing, kid.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.430
Five seconds.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.189
Alright, that's it.
Time's up, no more ink.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.065
Machines down.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.693
[Mark]
[Bleep] amazing, isn't it?

15:44.777 --> 15:45.611
[Shane] Yeah, it's beautiful.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.862
<i>I feel like the Buddha,</i>

15:46.945 --> 15:48.781
{\an8}it's done as good
as it can be done.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.157
{\an8}It just doesn't pop.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.450
<i>I gave it as much realism flair</i>
<i>as I possibly could.</i>

15:51.533 --> 15:53.869
<i>I had to run with that.</i>

15:53.952 --> 15:57.039
{\an8}I just completed
a really big tattoo.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.666
<i>I don't think anybody</i>
<i>could have done that much work</i>

15:58.749 --> 16:00.793
<i>in that amount of time.</i>

16:00.876 --> 16:03.295
[Tommy]
Today was a brutal [bleep] day.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.005
{\an8}We have finally made it
to the end

16:05.089 --> 16:07.174
{\an8}and I am [bleep] finishing, man,
I'm done.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.010
<i>But I'm so happy with</i>
<i>what</i> <i>I did for this last piece.</i>

16:10.094 --> 16:11.970
<i>I'm gonna grab that top spot.</i>

16:12.054 --> 16:13.222
[Tommy]
I'm very proud of the tattoo

16:13.305 --> 16:14.890
I did on you today.
You know what I mean?

16:16.684 --> 16:17.893
[James] The 12-hour tattoo
is, uh... Whew!

16:17.976 --> 16:20.562
[Shane] That dragged me
through the mud.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.730
[Tommy] I was, like,
[bleep] hammering.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.400
He was, like... "Aah!"
Trying to get it done, dude.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.443
I kept thinking, "There's no way
I'm finishing this."

16:26.527 --> 16:28.070
I just kept thinking
of all the other sections

16:28.153 --> 16:30.406
I still had to do, I was afraid
to turn his arm over.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.323
Thinking "I'm on schedule...
I'm not on schedule...

16:31.407 --> 16:33.242
I'm on schedule...
I'm not gonna finish,

16:33.325 --> 16:34.159
Goddamn it."

16:34.243 --> 16:35.744
I'd like to see,
if it was laid out,

16:35.828 --> 16:36.620
the square-inches
of everybody's tattoos.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.247
How big James' would be?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.748
[Tommy] I can't believe
how much work you got done.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.167
{\an8}I am so happy
I got this done.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.211
{\an8}<i>I'm ready.</i>
<i>I'm gonna win this one!</i>

16:44.294 --> 16:45.504
[giggles]

16:45.587 --> 16:47.715
I wanted to keep it
big, bold, and technical.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.258
[Shane] <i> I'm nervous as hell.</i>
<i>I mean, this is it.</i>

16:49.341 --> 16:50.259
{\an8}Somebody's winning,

16:50.342 --> 16:51.593
{\an8}and two people
are going home pissed off

16:51.677 --> 16:53.137
<i>that they just</i>
<i>spent all this time here.</i>

16:53.220 --> 16:54.847
<i>I did a good tattoo</i>
<i>for the final one,</i>

16:54.930 --> 16:56.849
but I'm nothing but nervous.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.076
This week we gave you 12 hours
to tattoo a master canvas

17:16.160 --> 17:19.496
selected by the judges
based on your portfolio

17:19.579 --> 17:21.582
and previous work done here
at <i> Ink Master.</i>

17:22.708 --> 17:24.667
Before we continue...

17:27.713 --> 17:28.047
I have a surprise for you.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.051
We will not be judging
your master canvases tonight.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.346
{\an8}[sighs] [bleep].

17:36.430 --> 17:39.725
instead, you'll be given
a second master canvas.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.810
[laughs] Oh, my God.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.271
I knew it wasn't [bleep] over.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.106
[Tommy] I'm exhausted, man.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.527
For these canvases, the design
is completely up to you.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.655
This is your chance
to tattoo exactly what you want.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.699
You'll have six hours to tattoo,

17:55.783 --> 17:57.826
and then we will critique

17:57.910 --> 18:01.163
both your 12-hour canvas
and your six-hour canvas.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.248
This is what it all
comes down to. This is it.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.958
One more sleepless night,

18:05.042 --> 18:06.043
one more badass tattoo

18:06.126 --> 18:07.795
out of each
and every one of you.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.630
You guys have this last chance
to walk out of here

18:09.713 --> 18:11.799
with 100 grand, man,

18:11.882 --> 18:14.468
and I'm talking to you
like a pep talk from hell.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.845
'Cause I know that
you thought you were done,

18:16.929 --> 18:19.306
but I promise you,
tomorrow it's over.

18:19.389 --> 18:20.766
Somebody's leaving
with 100 grand,

18:20.849 --> 18:22.184
and two people are just leaving.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.105
Let's meet your new canvases.

18:28.398 --> 18:28.440
[Bleep]

18:33.403 --> 18:34.947
Quite the surprise.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.908
Canvases, you guys are here
because you said

18:37.991 --> 18:40.035
that you would get anything
from these artists.

18:40.118 --> 18:41.411
You understand
what they're capable of,

18:41.495 --> 18:44.623
and you're willing to give them
six hours of your life

18:44.706 --> 18:46.291
for them to prove to us

18:46.375 --> 18:48.794
who's gonna walk out of here
with the grand prize.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.796
And artists, this is your time

18:50.879 --> 18:54.216
to do whatever you want

18:54.299 --> 18:56.176
to convince me and them

18:56.260 --> 19:00.013
that you're leaving here
as the <i> Ink Master</i>

19:00.097 --> 19:02.349
with a check for 100 grand.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.141
So if you've proven something

19:03.225 --> 19:05.644
or if you haven't
proven something

19:05.727 --> 19:08.397
that's gonna tip
or not tip the scale,

19:08.480 --> 19:10.315
this is your chamber,
and that's your bullet.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.860
Now you just gotta load
the weapon and shoot.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.368
[siren wailing]

19:25.873 --> 19:30.127
Artists, this is your time
to do whatever you want

19:30.210 --> 19:32.087
to convince me and them

19:32.170 --> 19:35.966
that you're leaving here
as the <i> Ink Master</i>

19:36.049 --> 19:37.801
with a check for 100 grand.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.970
For these canvases,

19:40.053 --> 19:43.432
the design
is completely up to you.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.142
[Oliver] If you haven't
proven something

19:45.225 --> 19:46.727
or still need
to prove something,

19:46.810 --> 19:47.811
this is your chance.

19:47.895 --> 19:48.937
As judges we wanna see

19:49.021 --> 19:51.064
as much representation
and skills

19:51.148 --> 19:53.817
as we can before we make
a final decision.

19:53.901 --> 19:54.985
If you just give us more

19:55.068 --> 19:56.862
of exactly what
you've already given us,

19:56.945 --> 19:58.488
maybe that's the best way
to go about it,

19:58.572 --> 19:59.448
maybe it's not.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.198
It's make it or break it time.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.408
In the original master canvas,

20:01.491 --> 20:03.994
everybody worked within
their regular comfort level,

20:04.077 --> 20:06.204
their one particular style.

20:06.288 --> 20:06.872
I hope to see
something different.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.082
Everybody think about that

20:09.166 --> 20:10.959
when you're coming up
with what you're gonna do.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.127
[Dave] You have
the rest of the evening

20:12.211 --> 20:14.504
to meet
with your master canvases.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.257
Tomorrow you'll have
six hours to tattoo.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.427
Good luck.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.595
[Oliver]
Good luck and hard work.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.140
{\an8}<i>We don't wanna</i>
<i>make our final judgment</i>

20:25.223 --> 20:27.976
{\an8}on the winner of this contest
solely based on one tattoo

20:28.060 --> 20:30.062
<i>and one style</i>
<i>and one</i> <i>particular theme</i>

20:30.145 --> 20:31.813
<i>that they did, so we're gonna</i>
<i>have them do</i>

20:31.897 --> 20:34.274
one more six-hour tattoo
with no limitations.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.817
<i>They can do any style</i>
<i>they want.</i>

20:35.901 --> 20:37.945
[Shane] Can I see the outside
of that calf, dude?

20:38.028 --> 20:39.863
That's the spot, right there.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.282
[Dave] <i> We found</i>
<i>three human canvases</i>

20:42.366 --> 20:44.910
{\an8}crazy enough to come in here

20:44.993 --> 20:47.162
<i>and get six-hour sessions</i>

20:47.245 --> 20:48.121
<i>with guys they've never met.</i>

20:48.205 --> 20:51.124
They have no idea
what it's gonna be.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.376
I gotta prove a point, you know.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.001
{\an5}-Yeah.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.001
-I gotta do something else.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.045
It'll be color for sure.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.839
{\an8}I'm taking this opportunity
to do a badass color piece

20:57.923 --> 20:58.882
{\an8}and just seal the deal,
you know?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.050
{\an8}Put my name on the check.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.677
Skull,

21:01.760 --> 21:03.470
probably a little whacked-out
in color.

21:03.553 --> 21:04.680
[Anthony] Yeah, I'm into color.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.181
{\an8}The term "Blank Canvas,"
it gets me a little nervous

21:06.264 --> 21:08.850
<i>'cause you don't know</i>
<i>what to expect.</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:10.519
[James] I think I have
an awesome plan.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.354
Flowers, snake... Cool.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.856
[Anastasia] <i> Giving James</i>
<i>complete control</i>

21:14.940 --> 21:16.525
<i>of what he wants to do</i>
<i>on my body...</i>

21:16.608 --> 21:19.444
{\an8}I am pretty nervous about it.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.612
<i>This is totally ludicrous</i>

21:20.696 --> 21:22.531
{\an8}because I am
absolutely exhausted.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.199
I'd really like to do
this beautiful woman with, like,

21:24.282 --> 21:24.950
a sense of life in her hands.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.160
I think holding, like, an apple.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.662
it would just be, like,
almost an illustration

21:28.745 --> 21:29.371
of a beautiful woman.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.373
[woman] Sounds interesting.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.582
It doesn't matter
what you say anyway.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.542
{\an5}-[laughs]

21:32.666 --> 21:33.542
-[Tommy] So there you go.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.504
[Shane] Oh, [bleep], du.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.550
That was the most insanely
stressful moment of my life.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.051
I almost dropped to my knees

21:43.135 --> 21:44.803
in anger, stress.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.680
I'm so [bleep] tired, dude.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.098
We're sitting there waiting
and waiting and waiting...

21:48.181 --> 21:49.599
"What the [bleep]
is the decision?"

21:49.683 --> 21:50.225
[Tommy]
I knew they would [bleep]

21:50.308 --> 21:52.310
pull some [bleep], dude.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.979
{\an5}-[James] Lord, have mercy.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.979
-[Tommy] What you gonna do?

21:54.062 --> 21:55.313
[Shane] What am I gonna do
for the tattoo?

21:55.397 --> 21:56.565
{\an5}-Yeah.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.565
-[Shane] Japanese...

21:56.648 --> 21:58.066
{\an5}-You do a portrait.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.066
-[James] I ain't going there.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.569
{\an5}-[Shane] What are you gonna do?

21:58.150 --> 22:00.569
-[James] Flowers and a snake.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.196
[Shane]
A snake, huh? Pretty stupid.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.449
<i>I really don't understand</i>
<i>James' choice</i>

22:05.532 --> 22:07.409
{\an8}of doing
another Japanese piece.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.078
<i>I mean, he just did a 3/4 sleeve</i>
<i>of Japanese-beautiful.</i>

22:10.162 --> 22:11.079
<i>Why do another Japanese piece?</i>

22:11.163 --> 22:13.415
<i>You're not showing anything?</i>

22:13.498 --> 22:15.625
It just makes things
easier on me.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.252
[Tommy] I'm doing a woman
holding an apple.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.712
They always rip me up
for my hands

22:18.795 --> 22:19.546
and my woman's face,

22:19.629 --> 22:21.256
so I'm gonna [bleep] tear it up.

22:21.339 --> 22:22.799
[Shane] I'm gonna do a woman...

22:24.092 --> 22:25.844
with the middle finger bent,

22:25.927 --> 22:27.763
two right feet,
and a Rocky Marciano nose.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.890
[laughs]

22:29.973 --> 22:30.891
[James]
So now he's rubbing it in.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.225
Talking [bleep] now!

22:35.353 --> 22:36.438
Morning, guys,

22:36.521 --> 22:39.107
remember, if you feel
you have anything to prove,

22:39.191 --> 22:40.901
now is the time.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.736
Make sure this tattoo is tight.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.614
One mistake could cost you
100 grand

22:45.697 --> 22:48.075
and the title of <i> Ink Master</i> .

22:48.158 --> 22:50.243
You have six hours
to do this tattoo.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.580
Your time starts now.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.460
{\an8}This is the grand finale.
It's all come down to this.

22:58.543 --> 23:01.004
<i>These guys have to show off</i>
<i>what they can do</i>

23:01.088 --> 23:03.006
{\an8}because two guys
are going home with [bleep]

23:03.090 --> 23:05.175
{\an8}and one guy is going home
with 100 grand.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.343
{\an8}Let's see it.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.970
[James] This is basically
what I came up with.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.722
<i>I feel that the design</i>
<i>I came up with</i>

23:10.806 --> 23:12.641
{\an8}focuses on
a lot of different elements

23:12.724 --> 23:15.185
{\an8}of all my critiques
through this competition.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.812
<i>It's my same style,</i>
<i>it's my comfort zone.</i>

23:16.895 --> 23:19.022
It's amazing.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.650
[woman]
How long does it take you

23:21.733 --> 23:23.068
to draw something like this?

23:23.151 --> 23:25.278
{\an5}-[Tommy] Seven hours.

23:23.151 --> 23:25.278
-Whoo!

23:25.362 --> 23:27.239
{\an8}I really need to show the judges
what they thought I couldn't do

23:27.322 --> 23:29.533
{\an8}throughout this
whole competition.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.493
<i>And that was women's hands</i>
<i>and women's faces.</i>

23:31.576 --> 23:34.371
During this competition,
those were my weak points.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.455
{\an5}-Mm-hmm.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.455
-[Tommy] So I was like,

23:35.539 --> 23:36.790
"Oh, I hope I get
a [bleep] woman's face."

23:36.873 --> 23:38.166
Like, I wanna show
that I can do that [bleep].

23:38.250 --> 23:40.502
This time though
I have to pull it

23:40.585 --> 23:41.753
to a whole new level.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.590
Two hours down, four to go.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.012
[Shane] Color is messy.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.265
It's no wonder
I love doing black and gray.

23:53.348 --> 23:56.518
{\an8}This'll prove without a doubt
that I'm totally well-rounded

23:56.601 --> 23:57.853
<i>in every style.</i>

23:57.936 --> 23:59.396
[Chris] Look at you.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.356
[Shane] I started off angry
then I got excited

24:01.439 --> 24:04.651
that at least I get
to show some color, you know?

24:04.734 --> 24:06.194
[Chris] <i> Shane is doing color.</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:08.488
{\an8}Smart boy, smart boy.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.574
{\an8}If he pulls it off,
this'll be a true testament

24:10.657 --> 24:12.826
{\an8}to his all-around
tattoo ability.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.119
[Shane] <i> My only concern is what</i>
<i>the other guys are gonna do.</i>

24:14.202 --> 24:16.413
Tommy just did a great tattoo,

24:16.496 --> 24:17.372
<i>and he has a great idea</i>
<i>for this piece.</i>

24:17.455 --> 24:19.207
<i>And I'd love to see him</i>
<i>drop the ball,</i>

24:19.291 --> 24:21.168
but I don't think
he's going to.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.711
He's very focused right now.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.965
[Tommy] I wanna do a woman
for you guys and prove it.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.633
Prove myself here.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.135
<i>Tommy decided to do a woman,</i>

24:30.218 --> 24:33.388
so he's kind of putting it back
in our faces, and I love that.

24:33.471 --> 24:33.638
One hour remaining.

24:38.727 --> 24:39.853
{\an8}[James] There's a lot
on the line

24:39.936 --> 24:43.857
{\an8}for me to do something
where I don't feel comfortable.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.817
{\an8}I'm not trying to go out
looking like a dip [bleep]

24:45.901 --> 24:48.862
{\an8}because I tried to do something
I don't do a lot, you know?

24:48.945 --> 24:51.281
[James] <i> I know they said</i>
<i>I could do anything I wanted to.</i>

24:51.364 --> 24:56.119
{\an8}I'm pretty comfortable
in my Japanese that it'll shine.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.454
I always say, "If you wanna
try to show someone

24:57.537 --> 25:00.624
your best work,
enjoy what you're doing."

25:00.707 --> 25:02.250
[Chris]
<i>We wanna see</i> <i>a pinup girl</i>

25:02.334 --> 25:05.086
<i>with regular feet</i>
<i>and a pretty face.</i>

25:05.170 --> 25:06.504
<i>This girl's got two right feet.</i>

25:06.588 --> 25:07.589
<i>For real,</i>
<i>this is a mistake, man.</i>

25:07.672 --> 25:10.592
{\an8}I wish James would have done
a [bleep] pinup girl

25:10.675 --> 25:14.054
{\an8}and been like, "Here guys,
[bleep] you very much."

25:14.137 --> 25:14.512
Fifteen minutes, everybody.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.934
[Oliver] <i> In making</i>
<i>our final decision</i>

25:19.017 --> 25:20.101
{\an8}on who takes
this whole enchilada,

25:20.185 --> 25:22.479
<i>having these two tattoos</i>

25:22.562 --> 25:25.148
<i>as opposed to only judging</i>
<i>on one tattoo,</i>

25:25.232 --> 25:28.193
<i>it's gonna give us as judges</i>
<i>a lot more to consider</i>

25:28.276 --> 25:30.320
<i>as far as</i>
<i>their skill level and talent.</i>

25:30.403 --> 25:32.948
Last five minutes.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.116
Tonight's decision is gonna be
the toughest one of them all

25:35.200 --> 25:36.618
because whoever walks away

25:36.701 --> 25:37.953
<i>with this money</i>
<i>really earned it,</i>

25:38.036 --> 25:40.038
<i>but the other guys...</i>
<i>they worked just as hard.</i>

25:40.121 --> 25:40.872
<i>And they're gonna</i>
<i>go away with nothing.</i>

25:40.956 --> 25:42.499
This is gonna be
a bad one tonight.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.625
Five seconds left.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.381
That's it.
Time's up, no more ink.

25:50.548 --> 25:50.966
[Anastasia] Oh, my God.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.842
You're amazing.

25:53.718 --> 25:54.135
[Tommy] Yeah, dude.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.222
[woman] Yeah!

25:57.305 --> 25:59.015
It might be one of the best
I did the whole show.

25:59.766 --> 26:00.850
It'd be [bleep] ironic

26:00.934 --> 26:02.727
if the best piece I did
the whole show was color.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.189
{\an8}[Chris] This was your time
to really get after it

26:06.273 --> 26:07.816
{\an8}and to really fight these guys.

26:07.899 --> 26:08.817
Today you coasted.

26:08.900 --> 26:09.734
No... I didn't coast.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.736
[Chris] You went kinda
on autopilot.

26:21.871 --> 26:22.914
[James] I'm kinda glad
we got to do another.

26:22.998 --> 26:26.001
[Shane] I'm real glad
'cause I didn't get a chance

26:26.084 --> 26:27.961
to do a color piece,
you know?

26:28.044 --> 26:30.839
[James] I thoroughly enjoyed
my first master canvas.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.674
Which Japanese piece
did you enjoy most, dude?

26:34.592 --> 26:36.803
[James] It's what
I wanted to do, you know.

26:36.886 --> 26:37.429
[Shane] If you would have done
something else,

26:37.512 --> 26:39.180
what would you have done?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.808
I'd like to have done,
like, a Tibetan skull.

26:41.891 --> 26:42.934
That's still your style though.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.603
You can't be dropping
the ball, dude.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.440
[Shane]
<i>We all wanna be</i> <i>Ink Master.</i>

26:48.523 --> 26:50.650
I'm not here to make friends,
I'm here to win the competition.

27:10.003 --> 27:13.423
For weeks you've endured
grueling tattoo sessions

27:13.506 --> 27:15.216
and harsh critiques.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.718
Yet you've all produced
impressive work.

27:18.053 --> 27:21.806
This week we asked you
to tattoo two master canvases.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.684
One was selected by the judges
based on your portfolio

27:24.768 --> 27:26.728
and the previous work
you've done here.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.773
The other was your chance
to tattoo whatever design

27:29.856 --> 27:32.525
you felt would showcase
your skills.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.155
And, James, you're up first.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.117
Let's talk about
your 12-hour tattoo.

27:41.201 --> 27:46.414
[James] <i> I wanted to focus on</i>
<i>all the aspects of shading,</i>

27:46.498 --> 27:47.415
<i>blending,</i>

27:47.832 --> 27:48.541
<i>line work,</i>

27:48.625 --> 27:50.752
<i>depth and show that I did learn</i>

27:50.835 --> 27:53.463
and do what I know I can do
in that amount of time.

27:53.546 --> 27:56.091
Dude, you're
an amazing tattooer, man.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.426
You bang out big work.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.594
[Oliver] <i> Not a lot of tattooers</i>

27:59.677 --> 28:00.553
<i>could have done</i>
<i>this amount of tattooing</i>

28:00.637 --> 28:03.181
<i>in the two sessions</i>
<i>that you did.</i>

28:03.264 --> 28:04.974
<i>The detail</i>
<i>around</i> <i>the glow of the "Om,"</i>

28:05.058 --> 28:07.769
<i>the color there,</i>
<i>the line work is spot on.</i>

28:07.852 --> 28:09.604
By far the best tattoo
we've seen from you.

28:09.687 --> 28:12.941
Yeah, that's what
I aspire to do every day.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.443
Alright, James, let's talk
about your six-hour tattoo.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.946
{\an5}<i>-Japanese ink style.</i>

28:15.527 --> 28:17.946
-[James] Yes.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.364
[Dave]
<i>Didn't we just</i> <i>kinda do this?</i>

28:19.447 --> 28:20.156
I know that we were told

28:20.240 --> 28:21.157
"Hey, do whatever
you want to do."

28:21.241 --> 28:23.451
I love flowers.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.953
<i>I can do flowers every day</i>
<i>of the week, I love them.</i>

28:25.036 --> 28:26.121
But James, this isn't
every day of the week.

28:26.204 --> 28:29.457
{\an5}-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:26.204 --> 28:29.457
-You're up for $100,000.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.043
[James] It is a lot on the line,
and I wanted to do my best.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.588
I didn't wanna step out
of my comfort zone and look bad.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.465
I feel like
instead of staring it back

28:37.549 --> 28:38.633
in the face and going,

28:38.716 --> 28:41.511
"'F you, I'm gonna go at this,
and I'm gonna do it,"

28:41.594 --> 28:43.304
<i>you went, "I'm gonna go</i>
<i>to my safe place</i>

28:43.388 --> 28:44.973
instead of competing."

28:46.391 --> 28:47.934
As far as the snake head goes,

28:48.017 --> 28:49.519
<i>this snake head seems like</i>

28:49.602 --> 28:51.855
<i>it's just a part</i>
<i>of the different tattoo.</i>

28:51.938 --> 28:54.399
<i>I mean, maybe there is</i>
<i>a snake out there somewhere</i>

28:54.482 --> 28:57.110
that has these traits
that I just haven't seen yet.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.362
[Chris] <i> The belly...</i>
<i>Why not outline every plate</i>

28:59.446 --> 29:01.364
<i>instead of two solid lines</i>

29:01.448 --> 29:03.324
<i>and then</i>
<i>train-track type across?</i>

29:03.408 --> 29:06.077
Doing these big tattoos,
you're short changing yourself

29:06.161 --> 29:07.162
in one department or another.

29:07.245 --> 29:10.582
I mean, we're here last day,
you made top three.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.000
Why not put bells and whistles
on everything?

29:12.083 --> 29:15.295
Man, if I would have been you,
I would have done a pinup.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.504
It would have been
the slap in the face

29:16.588 --> 29:19.215
back for you to nail it
and do it the way you know how.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.341
And kill it.

29:27.056 --> 29:27.765
Shane, you're next.

29:31.644 --> 29:33.646
Let's talk about
your 12-hour tattoo.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.358
<i>The shading in the face,</i>
<i>especially, is so soft.</i>

29:37.442 --> 29:40.320
<i>The use of the negative space</i>
<i>and the chin,</i>

29:40.403 --> 29:41.779
<i>the really dramatic</i>
<i>hard outline...</i>

29:41.863 --> 29:44.115
<i>This thing looks like</i>
<i>a carved statue.</i>

29:44.199 --> 29:45.533
[Chris] I've seen
a lot of these done,

29:45.617 --> 29:48.119
and it is so easy
to just jack these things up.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.662
<i>To give it this dimension</i>

29:49.746 --> 29:51.372
<i>and the way</i>
<i>you made this thing look,</i>

29:51.456 --> 29:52.874
<i>how it was kinda statuesque,</i>

29:52.957 --> 29:54.751
you really excelled with this.

29:54.834 --> 29:55.960
Thanks, man, appreciate it.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.756
Shane, let's talk
about your six-hour tattoo.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.382
<i>You threw in color.</i>

30:01.466 --> 30:02.717
[Shane] <i> I had an opportunity</i>
<i>to show color,</i>

30:02.800 --> 30:04.052
so I had to take it.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.220
The thing
I like about this tattoo

30:05.303 --> 30:06.721
is the texture.

30:06.804 --> 30:09.891
<i>The actual bone-like ripples</i>
<i>and fractures and stuff.</i>

30:09.974 --> 30:12.477
My complaint about this tattoo
is I don't feel like

30:12.560 --> 30:13.853
<i>there's enough solid black</i>
<i>in this thing</i>

30:13.937 --> 30:16.773
<i>to make this thing</i>
<i>really contrast up.</i>

30:16.856 --> 30:19.692
I think it's just, like,
a deep richness

30:19.776 --> 30:21.861
that you get
by a harsh contrast

30:21.945 --> 30:24.739
between totally dark
and totally light.

30:24.822 --> 30:27.534
[Chris] <i> There's so much detail</i>
<i>in that skull head.</i>

30:27.617 --> 30:30.662
The filigree is so simple,
it's a little bit flat.

30:30.745 --> 30:31.955
If you would have just put
some extra line work in there,

30:32.038 --> 30:34.082
that would have changed
the whole feel of this tattoo.

30:34.165 --> 30:38.878
It looks like it's just kinda
lacking the snap in those areas.

30:38.962 --> 30:39.921
Today you coasted,

30:40.004 --> 30:41.631
you know, you went
kind of on autopilot.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.174
[Shane]
No... I... I didn't coast.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.385
I was struggling
to do the six hours.

30:45.468 --> 30:48.263
I had thought numerous times
about putting more thin lines,

30:48.346 --> 30:50.056
and I felt like I was gonna get
my balls busted

30:50.139 --> 30:51.766
for going too realistic
in the skull.

30:51.849 --> 30:53.017
So I, like, was hesitant

30:53.101 --> 30:54.769
to go even more realistic
with the filigree. I mean...

30:54.852 --> 30:57.105
You came in for the kill
with the color,

30:57.188 --> 30:57.939
but you eased up
on the detail a lot.

31:05.947 --> 31:05.989
[Dave] Tommy.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.828
Let's take a look
at your 12-hour tattoo.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.121
<i>This is a big,</i>

31:13.204 --> 31:14.706
<i>impressive, dark piece.</i>

31:14.789 --> 31:17.041
I really like
the outcome of it.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.459
The thing
I love about it the most

31:18.543 --> 31:20.795
<i>is how much black</i>
<i>you got in there.</i>

31:20.878 --> 31:23.006
<i>This tattoo could have</i>
<i>gone south so easily.</i>

31:23.089 --> 31:23.881
Too much color
and not enough black,

31:23.965 --> 31:26.467
this tattoo
would just look weak.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.761
<i>The way to make</i>
<i>these light colors stand up</i>

31:28.845 --> 31:31.431
<i>is put them against</i>
<i>something dark.</i>

31:31.514 --> 31:32.890
[Chris] All the detail you did
wrapped around the horns

31:32.974 --> 31:36.185
<i>and in the helmet,</i>
<i>set this tattoo apart.</i>

31:36.269 --> 31:38.521
You really hit this
on the head.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.315
Man, Tommy,
this tattoo's badass.

31:40.398 --> 31:44.027
Like, of any tattoo
we've seen this entire contest,

31:44.110 --> 31:45.737
this is probably
the most badass one.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.072
I can't say the word
"badass" enough.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.037
Tommy, let's talk
about the six-hour tattoo.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.872
<i>She's gorgeous.</i>

31:55.955 --> 31:59.000
<i>Hands are beautiful,</i>
<i>the face is soft.</i>

31:59.083 --> 32:02.128
<i>The fabric wrapped around her,</i>
<i>I can see through it.</i>

32:02.211 --> 32:04.213
She's pretty breathtaking, dude.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.673
[Oliver] <i> You got the nose,</i>
<i>you got the lips.</i>

32:05.757 --> 32:07.634
<i>You got the eyebrows,</i>

32:07.717 --> 32:09.052
<i>you got the hairline.</i>

32:09.135 --> 32:10.178
the skin tone,

32:10.261 --> 32:12.847
<i>smooth and soft</i>
<i>with a bit of natural highlights</i>

32:12.930 --> 32:14.515
<i>in the skin tone</i>
<i>that you left in there.</i>

32:14.599 --> 32:15.642
<i>Damn near flawless.</i>

32:15.725 --> 32:18.478
Good job taking things
that beat you up in the past

32:18.561 --> 32:19.771
and not shying away
from it.

32:19.854 --> 32:20.772
Yeah, I wanted to rise
on this one for you guys.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.566
[Chris] It's definitely,
definitely obvious

32:23.650 --> 32:25.943
that you came out today
to fight,

32:26.027 --> 32:28.488
that you came out
to slap us back.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.490
<i>"I can do hands, I can do faces.</i>

32:30.573 --> 32:31.699
<i>I can do the damn thing."</i>

32:31.783 --> 32:34.535
This is my favorite tattoo
that you've done here,

32:34.619 --> 32:35.662
and actually I'm gonna tell you

32:35.745 --> 32:36.704
it's my favorite tattoo
of the show.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.374
{\an5}-Wow.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.374
-[Chris] Smartly played.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.958
You're definitely
fighting, buddy.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.418
{\an5}-Thank you so much, man.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.418
-Good job.

32:42.502 --> 32:43.503
[Tommy] I appreciate it.

32:49.258 --> 32:52.220
Head back to the Brownstone,
we'll discuss your work

32:52.303 --> 32:54.180
and decide who will be named
the first ever <i> Ink Master</i> .

32:56.808 --> 32:58.393
[Shane] <i> My heart's beating</i>
<i>out of my chest.</i>

32:58.476 --> 32:59.352
Tommy came on strong
at the end.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.646
<i>I mean, he did</i>
<i>two amazing pieces.</i>

33:01.729 --> 33:04.065
<i>I was more confident yesterday</i>
<i>than I am right now.</i>

33:04.148 --> 33:05.149
I'm more nervous
than I've ever been in my life.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.456
Tough one. Really tough.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.333
<i>Let's talk</i>
<i>about the 12-hour, James.</i>

33:22.417 --> 33:25.962
[Chris] <i> This tattoo for me</i>
<i>has so many elements</i>

33:26.045 --> 33:28.005
<i>packed into it</i>
<i>that it became stiff.</i>

33:28.881 --> 33:30.091
<i>I can't focus.</i>

33:30.174 --> 33:31.551
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what to look at.</i>

33:31.634 --> 33:32.844
<i>My eyes are everywhere.</i>

33:32.927 --> 33:35.179
I'm disappointed
in his six-hour tattoo

33:35.263 --> 33:37.014
<i>because there's nothing</i>
<i>I can say about this tattoo</i>

33:37.098 --> 33:38.516
<i>I didn't say</i>
<i>about the other one.</i>

33:38.599 --> 33:40.601
[Chris] If I had to pull
two people that I think

33:40.685 --> 33:41.769
where the battle royale
is raging over,

33:41.853 --> 33:44.230
it's gonna be Shane and Tommy.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.524
Let's talk
about Tommy's six-hour.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.735
<i>One of the better tattoos</i>
<i>we've seen.</i>

33:48.818 --> 33:50.027
Your favorite
of the competition.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.112
{\an5}-Absolutely.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.112
-Alright.

33:51.195 --> 33:51.946
A couple of points
that we didn't bring up.

33:52.029 --> 33:54.741
Are the eyes
slightly cross-eyed?

33:54.824 --> 33:56.451
[Chris] <i> The highlight</i>
<i>on the right eye</i>

33:56.534 --> 33:57.577
<i>is a little bit farther back</i>

33:57.660 --> 34:00.455
<i>and set back more so</i>
<i>than the one on the left.</i>

34:00.538 --> 34:02.582
It takes one dot

34:02.665 --> 34:04.333
to throw off
an entire expression.

34:04.417 --> 34:07.295
And I'm also seeing,
if you look on the right side,

34:07.378 --> 34:08.755
<i>there's no ear.</i>

34:08.838 --> 34:11.132
[Chris] <i> It needed the lobe and,</i>
<i>like, an ornate piece of jewelry</i>

34:11.215 --> 34:12.132
<i>hanging from that lobe</i>

34:12.216 --> 34:13.967
would have set that tattoo
on fire.

34:14.051 --> 34:16.512
[Dave]
<i>Let's go</i> <i>to Shane's 12-hour.</i>

34:16.596 --> 34:17.972
<i>You guys never</i>
<i>brought this up,</i>

34:18.056 --> 34:19.599
<i>but wasn't there a question</i>

34:19.681 --> 34:20.975
{\an5}<i>-about this thumb?</i>

34:19.681 --> 34:20.975
-[Chris] <i> Yeah.</i>

34:21.058 --> 34:22.143
[Dave] <i> Look at the right thumb,</i>

34:22.226 --> 34:24.478
<i>and then look at the left thumb.</i>

34:24.562 --> 34:25.480
[Chris] <i> It's definitely wide.</i>

34:25.563 --> 34:26.773
[Dave] <i> They're different thumbs.</i>

34:26.856 --> 34:28.983
Slightly off, he missed
his mark on that one.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.319
Here's the thing
is that it seems so close

34:31.402 --> 34:33.070
that at this point
it's nitpicking.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.822
Well, I think that Shane,
in his 12-hour tattoo,

34:35.907 --> 34:37.742
<i>totally killed it</i>
<i>with the black and gray piece,</i>

34:37.824 --> 34:39.786
which was no surprise
to any of us

34:39.869 --> 34:41.496
because throughout
this competition,

34:41.579 --> 34:43.039
<i>he has done</i>
<i>predominately black and gray</i>

34:43.121 --> 34:44.331
<i>in everything he's done.</i>

34:44.415 --> 34:46.626
Well, he's kind of got
an easy ride on this whole thing

34:46.708 --> 34:48.043
doing what he does best.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.963
<i>Tommy... His best two tattoos</i>

34:51.047 --> 34:53.341
<i>of this entire competition</i>
<i>are right now.</i>

34:53.424 --> 34:55.342
If I was judging solely
on what we've seen today,

34:55.426 --> 34:58.304
it would be hard not
to put him high in the running.

34:58.387 --> 35:01.891
We've seen the same two guys
rise and not fall.

35:01.974 --> 35:04.060
<i>Tommy took a tumble</i>
<i>and redeemed himself</i>

35:04.143 --> 35:05.019
<i>right here with a pinup.</i>

35:05.103 --> 35:06.979
This is about being
well-rounded,

35:07.063 --> 35:09.357
and we've been
preaching this

35:09.440 --> 35:10.191
the whole time
we've sat up here.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.277
And I think
we have two tattooers

35:13.361 --> 35:14.821
that are really well-rounded.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.280
So you guys
are pretty locked in

35:16.364 --> 35:16.989
to where you want
to go with this?

35:17.073 --> 35:19.283
We gotta call it like it is.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.786
I think it's a tough call,
but it's a call we gotta make.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.204
{\an5}-You wanna get them?

35:21.869 --> 35:23.204
-I'm ready.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.121
Alright, man.

35:28.793 --> 35:29.544
[Oliver]
How's everybody feeling?

35:30.962 --> 35:31.921
You all ready to do this?

35:33.923 --> 35:35.925
Let's, uh,
take it up to the shop.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.680
{\an8}Seconds away.
Very nervous, very nervous.

35:52.733 --> 35:53.693
[Dave] This is it.

35:55.111 --> 35:58.281
One of you is about to have
his life changed forever.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.992
The winner
will receive $100,000,

36:01.075 --> 36:02.743
a feature in <i> Inked Magazine,</i>

36:02.827 --> 36:04.871
and the title of <i> Ink Master</i> .

36:07.248 --> 36:09.166
It's been a pleasure
to watch all of you guys work

36:09.250 --> 36:12.545
and to watch all of you guys
battle it out.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.422
[Oliver] All three of you
are great artists.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.132
This was not
a landslide victory.

36:16.215 --> 36:18.050
Between the three of you,
there was points

36:18.134 --> 36:19.218
where it could have gone
either way.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.220
Shane.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.098
[Chris] You've been consistent
the whole ride.

36:24.181 --> 36:27.143
<i>Your line work</i>
<i>is always on point.</i>

36:27.226 --> 36:29.145
<i>Your shading</i>
<i>is always smooth.</i>

36:29.228 --> 36:30.897
<i>Your outline, flawless.</i>

36:30.980 --> 36:32.607
<i>You proved</i>
<i>that</i> <i>you can put in color.</i>

36:32.690 --> 36:35.109
You're an all-around,
well-rounded tattooer, man.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.111
[Dave] James.

36:37.194 --> 36:39.113
Hillbilly. Kickass tattooer.

36:39.196 --> 36:41.115
You do stuff that
a lot of people couldn't do.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.951
<i>Technically,</i>
<i>a very solid tattooer.</i>

36:44.035 --> 36:46.412
<i>line work, color,</i>
<i>even your shading.</i>

36:46.495 --> 36:47.538
<i>Nobody can deny</i>

36:47.622 --> 36:49.999
you did some [bleep]
awesome tattoos here, man.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.836
Tommy.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.129
[Oliver] You operate
as a true professional.

36:55.212 --> 36:57.465
Solid tattooer.
You know the styles.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.508
A task comes your way,
no second-guessing,

36:59.592 --> 37:00.843
<i>you know what</i>
<i>to do with it.</i>

37:00.927 --> 37:03.512
[Chris] <i> You're bulletproof.</i>
<i>Your color is solid.</i>

37:03.596 --> 37:04.931
<i>Your style comes through,</i>

37:05.014 --> 37:06.223
and you have a very unique style
that's your own.

37:11.437 --> 37:11.479
[Dave] Well, let's get to it.

37:15.983 --> 37:18.110
James, please step forward.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.033
The judges have discussed
your work.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.118
And James...

37:33.167 --> 37:35.086
you do not have what it takes
to be <i> Ink Master</i> .

37:39.590 --> 37:41.175
[Chris] Today,
in this final judging,

37:41.259 --> 37:43.010
this was your time
to really get after it

37:43.094 --> 37:44.595
and to really fight these guys.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.555
I just would have liked
to have seen you come harder.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.140
I feel like you just
laid down a little, man,

37:48.224 --> 37:49.892
That's why you're in third.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.852
[Oliver] In this last challenge,
we wanted to see

37:51.936 --> 37:53.396
a little bit more versatility.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.898
If this was a competition
based on what you do best,

37:55.982 --> 37:57.358
you'd be hard to beat.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.359
I understand.
I'm proud to be here.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.448
[James] <i> If it was judged</i>
<i>on the 12-hour tattoo alone,</i>

38:04.532 --> 38:05.616
<i>I know I would have won.</i>

38:05.700 --> 38:07.284
<i>I really wished I would have</i>
<i>stretched myself</i>

38:07.368 --> 38:08.411
<i>a little further.</i>

38:08.494 --> 38:10.037
<i>I should have went</i>
<i>totally out of my element</i>

38:10.121 --> 38:11.372
<i>and pushed myself.</i>

38:11.455 --> 38:13.582
But hindsight's 20/20,
you know?

38:14.834 --> 38:15.835
And then there were two.

38:17.461 --> 38:18.546
Shane and Tommy,

38:19.797 --> 38:20.506
please step forward.

38:22.299 --> 38:24.719
[Shane] [whispering]
Good luck, man.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.971
This was the toughest decision.

38:27.054 --> 38:29.890
You two have been at each other
this whole ride.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.727
[Oliver] Shane, artistically,
man, you have a good eye.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.145
Every tattoo you've done here
shows that.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.814
<i>Even the tattoos</i>
<i>that missed their mark</i>

38:36.897 --> 38:38.441
<i>on that exact challenge,</i>

38:38.524 --> 38:40.526
<i>were still artistically sound.</i>

38:41.944 --> 38:43.279
You make it look effortless.

38:44.822 --> 38:45.573
[Chris] Tommy.

38:45.656 --> 38:48.159
You're an amazing
tattooer, brother.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.368
The effort
that you've put in,

38:49.452 --> 38:52.288
<i>drawing every night,</i>
<i>doing your studies,</i>

38:52.371 --> 38:54.040
<i>doing your homework,</i>
<i>it shows,</i>

38:54.123 --> 38:56.250
<i>that tattoo today showed.</i>

38:56.333 --> 38:57.960
<i>I said, "It's my favorite tattoo</i>
<i>of the competition."</i>

38:58.044 --> 38:59.754
I appreciate that.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.843
We went at it on this one.
We went back and forth.

39:05.926 --> 39:08.304
This was the toughest decision
for us.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.349
Shane...

39:15.061 --> 39:16.353
after discussing your work,

39:19.774 --> 39:20.775
the judges have decided...

39:29.200 --> 39:30.659
you have earned
the title of <i> Ink Master</i> .

39:30.743 --> 39:31.660
Congratulations, man.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.412
[Tommy] Good job.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.877
{\an5}-Thank you.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.877
-Congrats, man.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.170
Enjoy this victory.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.838
[Oliver] You came
in the final hour

39:42.922 --> 39:44.131
and packed that color in.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.883
<i>That sealed the deal for us.</i>

39:45.966 --> 39:47.218
<i>Everything you did,</i>
<i>you pulled off.</i>

39:47.301 --> 39:49.970
Thank you, man.
Thank you so much.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.139
[Shane] <i> It's awesome,</i>
<i>it's an awesome feeling.</i>

39:52.223 --> 39:52.807
<i>It's just gonna blow</i>
<i>my career up.</i>

39:52.890 --> 39:54.892
It's amazing.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.644
I... I... I can't believe
I accomplished this.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.395
<i>I made it here on my own,</i>
<i>and I made it</i>

39:58.479 --> 39:59.480
through this competition
and gave it 100 percent.

39:59.563 --> 40:03.150
and here I am,
the mother [bleep] <i> Ink Master</i> .

40:03.234 --> 40:04.318
[chuckles]

40:04.402 --> 40:05.486
[Chris] Talk to me, Tommy.

40:05.569 --> 40:06.821
[Tommy] I feel like
a piece of [bleep], man.

40:06.904 --> 40:07.905
No, no, no!

40:07.988 --> 40:10.116
I'm, uh... I'm actually...

40:10.199 --> 40:12.076
You know, I'm so excited
that I was a part of this.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.244
[Chris] Call it like it is, man.

40:13.327 --> 40:14.912
{\an5}-That pinup got you.

40:13.327 --> 40:14.912
-[Tommy] <i> I know.</i>

40:14.995 --> 40:17.081
Because the only thing
that kept it different

40:17.164 --> 40:20.167
is the fact that he's
never been down here. That's it.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.211
I didn't see
another way to be fair.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.838
It was the report card.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.381
You were all "A's" and a "B."

40:25.464 --> 40:26.590
[Tommy] <i> As a competitor in this,</i>

40:26.674 --> 40:28.217
<i>I would have loved</i>
<i>to be the winner,</i>

40:28.300 --> 40:29.468
but the experience here
at <i> Ink Master</i> was awesome.

40:29.552 --> 40:32.346
<i>I learned so much</i>
<i>from all the other artists</i>

40:32.429 --> 40:33.347
<i>I lived with.</i>

40:33.431 --> 40:34.765
<i>I learned so much</i>
<i>from my critiques.</i>

40:34.849 --> 40:37.143
<i>My work is gonna take</i>
<i>a new jump for the better.</i>

40:37.226 --> 40:38.018
<i>I'm super happy</i>

40:38.102 --> 40:40.020
with this whole
entire experience.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.272
Shane, how do you feel
right now?

40:42.940 --> 40:45.651
It hasn't really sunk in, man,
I can't wait to call my family.

40:45.734 --> 40:48.112
Alright, Shane,
once again, congratulations.

40:48.195 --> 40:48.988
Thank you.

40:49.071 --> 40:49.989
[applause]
