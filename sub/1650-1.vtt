WEBVTT

00:10.845 --> 00:14.133
( raspy breathing )

00:31.365 --> 00:33.196
( groans )

01:20.957 --> 01:23.073
( door creaks)

01:25.628 --> 01:28.210
( raspy breathing )

02:11.590 --> 02:13.171
( crossbow twangs )

02:16.971 --> 02:19.087
( whistles )

03:29.835 --> 03:32.212
(can opener grinding)

03:47.561 --> 03:49.768
( can clatters )

04:12.586 --> 04:14.247
Psst

04:39.280 --> 04:41.612
(snarling )

04:59.300 --> 04:59.379
(theme music playing )

04:59.383 --> 05:01.920
(theme music playing )

05:50.059 --> 05:53.301
15, you're on point.

05:53.479 --> 05:54.764
We got no place
left to go.

05:54.939 --> 05:57.521
When this herd meets up with
this one, we'll be cut off.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.192
We'll never make it south.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.851
What would you say?
That was about 150 head?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.520
That was last week.
It could be twice that by now.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.780
Hershel: This river could
have delayed them.

06:06.951 --> 06:09.693
If we move fast, we might have
a shot to tear right through there.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.485
Yeah, but if this group
joins with that one,

06:11.664 --> 06:12.870
they could spill out this way.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.541
So we're blocked.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.494
Only thing to do
is double back at 27

06:16.669 --> 06:17.875
and swing towards Greenville.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.546
Yeah, we picked
through that already.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.044
It's like we spent the winter
going in circles.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.206
Yeah, I know. I know.

06:23.384 --> 06:26.842
At Newnan we'll push west.
Haven't been through there yet.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.799
We can't keep going
house to house.

06:29.974 --> 06:33.011
Need to find someplace
to hole up for a few weeks.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.767
All right.
Is it cool if we get to the creek

06:35.938 --> 06:37.394
before we head out?
Won't take long.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.180
We got to fill up on water.
We can boil it later.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.643
Knock yourself out.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.059
She can't take much more
of this moving about.

06:43.237 --> 06:46.149
What else can we do?
Let her give birth on the run?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.939
Do you see a way
around that?

06:51.412 --> 06:54.654
Hey, while the others
wash their panties,

06:54.832 --> 06:56.743
let's go hunt.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.294
That owl didn't exactly
hit the spot.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.248
(walkers moaning )

07:11.098 --> 07:13.054
That's a shame.

07:44.048 --> 07:47.006
- Watch the backside.
- Got it.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.635
Hurry. Hurry!

08:01.148 --> 08:03.560
(walkers growling )

08:10.115 --> 08:12.447
( growls )

08:34.848 --> 08:37.965
( panting )

08:42.314 --> 08:43.975
It's perfect.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.356
If we can shut that gate,

08:46.527 --> 08:48.483
prevent more
from filling the yard,

08:48.654 --> 08:50.144
we can pick off
these walkers.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.698
We'll take the field
by tonight.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.151
So how do we
shut the gate?

08:54.326 --> 08:56.738
I'll do it.
You guys cover me.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.870
No.
It's a suicide run.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.746
I'm the fastest.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.034
No, you, Maggie, and Beth
draw as many as you can over there.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.748
Pop 'em through the fence.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.878
Daryl, go back to
the other tower.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.540
Carol, you've become
a pretty good shot.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.131
Take your time. We don't have
a lot of ammo to waste.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.795
Hershel, you and Carl
take this tower.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.056
All right.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.217
I'll run for the gate.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.720
(snarling, moaning)

09:30.404 --> 09:32.895
(shouting )

09:33.073 --> 09:35.155
- Come on!
- Hey, come here!

09:41.790 --> 09:44.406
- Come on!
- Hey, come here!

10:04.938 --> 10:07.270
Come on!
Come on!

10:22.623 --> 10:24.079
Sorry.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.504
Hey, come on,
over here!

10:29.671 --> 10:31.207
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, over here!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.796
( snarls )

10:51.693 --> 10:54.856
(growling)

10:55.030 --> 10:56.315
He did it.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.151
Light it up!

11:44.913 --> 11:46.824
Fantastic.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.536
Nice shooting.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.041
You okay?

11:51.211 --> 11:54.374
- I haven't felt this good in weeks.
- Good.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.960
Carol: Oh!
( laughs)

11:57.134 --> 11:58.874
Oh!

11:59.052 --> 12:01.885
We haven't had this much space
since we left the farm.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.761
( laughs)

12:03.932 --> 12:06.548
( growls )

12:10.439 --> 12:13.806
( laughs)

12:13.984 --> 12:16.771
Whoo!

12:38.634 --> 12:41.421
Mmm. Just like Mom
used to make.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.103
T-Dog: Tomorrow we'll put all
the bodies together.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.889
Want to keep them away
from that water.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.524
Now, if we can dig
a canal under the fence,

12:57.694 --> 12:59.400
we'll have plenty
of fresh water.

12:59.571 --> 13:03.109
Hershel: And this soil is good.
We could plant some seed,

13:03.283 --> 13:06.241
grow some tomatoes,
cucumbers, soybeans.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.076
That's his
third time around.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.080
If there was any part
of it compromised,

13:16.254 --> 13:18.961
he'd have found it
by now.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.509
This'll be a good place
to have the baby.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.092
Safe.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.649
It's not much, but if I don't bring
you something,

13:39.820 --> 13:41.651
you won't eat at all.

13:41.822 --> 13:45.485
I guess little Shane over there
has got quite the appetite.

13:45.659 --> 13:48.696
Don't be mean.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.485
Rick's gotten us
a lot farther

13:50.664 --> 13:52.450
than I ever thought he would,
I'll give him that.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.000
Mm-hmm.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.499
Shane could never
have done that.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.168
It's that rifle.
The kickback.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.879
I'm just not used to it.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.553
Hold on.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.530
Better get back.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.535
It's pretty romantic.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.161
Want to screw around?

14:33.331 --> 14:35.367
Pfft.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.373
( both laugh )

14:37.544 --> 14:39.000
I'll go down first.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.036
Even better.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.205
Stop.

14:44.885 --> 14:48.924
Hershel:
Bethy, sing Paddy Reilly for me.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.758
I haven't heard that,
I think,

14:50.932 --> 14:53.218
since your mother
was alive.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.725
Daddy, not that one, please.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.557
How about
"The Parting Glass"?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.901
No one wants to hear.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.272
Why not?

15:11.912 --> 15:13.777
Okay.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.248
J‘ Of all the money J‘

15:19.419 --> 15:22.627
J‘ E'er I had J‘

15:22.798 --> 15:27.417
J‘ I spent it
in good company J‘

15:27.594 --> 15:31.007
J‘ And all the harm J‘

15:31.181 --> 15:33.547
J‘ E'er I've ever done J‘

15:33.725 --> 15:39.311
J‘ Alas it was to none
but me J‘

15:39.481 --> 15:42.439
J‘ And all I've done J‘

15:42.609 --> 15:45.442
J‘ For want of wit J‘

15:45.612 --> 15:50.276
J‘ To memory now
I can't recall J‘

15:50.450 --> 15:53.283
J‘ So fill to me J‘

15:53.453 --> 15:55.944
J‘ The parting glass J‘

15:56.123 --> 16:01.709
J‘ Good night and joy
be with you all J‘

16:04.631 --> 16:07.623
Both:
J‘ Oh, all the comrades J‘

16:07.801 --> 16:09.792
J‘ That e'erl had J‘

16:09.970 --> 16:14.760
J‘ Were sorry
for my going away J‘

16:14.933 --> 16:18.300
J‘ And all the sweethearts J‘

16:18.478 --> 16:20.343
J‘ That e'erl had J‘

16:20.522 --> 16:22.103
J‘ Would wish me J‘

16:22.274 --> 16:25.391
- J‘ One more day to stay J‘
- I had some.

16:25.569 --> 16:31.030
J‘ But since it falls
unto my lot J‘

16:31.199 --> 16:33.485
J‘ That I should rise J‘

16:33.660 --> 16:36.618
J‘ And you should not J‘

16:36.788 --> 16:39.871
J‘ l'll gently rise J‘

16:40.041 --> 16:42.293
J‘ And I'll softly call J‘

16:42.460 --> 16:45.293
J‘ Good night and joy J‘

16:45.463 --> 16:48.000
J‘ Be with you all J‘

16:48.175 --> 16:51.042
J‘ Good night and joy J‘

16:51.219 --> 16:54.131
J‘ Be with you all. J‘

16:58.393 --> 17:00.258
Beautiful.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.351
Better all turn in.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.390
I'll take watch over there.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.651
Got a big day tomorrow.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.527
What do you mean?

17:13.909 --> 17:16.195
Look, I know
we're all exhausted.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.450
This was a great win.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.617
But we've got to push
just a little bit more.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.923
Most of the walkers are dressed
as guards and prisoners.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.754
Looks like this place
fell pretty early.

17:33.929 --> 17:37.171
It could mean the supplies
may be intact.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.510
They'd have an infirmary,

17:39.684 --> 17:41.265
a commissary.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.516
An armory?

17:42.687 --> 17:43.893
That would be outside
the prison itself,

17:44.064 --> 17:45.929
but not too far away.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.723
Warden's offices would
have info on the location.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.689
Weapons, food, medicine.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.899
This place could be
a gold mine.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.406
Hershel: We're dangerously
low on ammo.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.487
We'd run out
before we make a dent.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.448
That's why we have
to go in there...

18:02.249 --> 18:04.410
hand to hand.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.373
After all we've been through,

18:09.547 --> 18:12.539
we can handle it, I know it.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.050
These assholes
don't stand a chance.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.910
Psst

18:47.669 --> 18:49.330
I appreciate everything
you're doing.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.210
We all do,

18:51.381 --> 18:53.667
but it's been a death march
and they're exhausted.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.958
Can we just enjoy this
for a few days?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.546
Baby will be here
in a few days.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.009
There's no time
for a picnic.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.220
No, but it's time
to get the house in order.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.386
What do you think
I'm doing?

19:08.940 --> 19:10.476
Your absolute best.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.686
Don't patronize me.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.817
I'm not.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.774
I'm just saying

19:16.948 --> 19:18.654
the baby is about
to be here

19:18.825 --> 19:21.111
- and we need to talk about--
- About what?

19:25.749 --> 19:28.707
Things we've been avoiding--

19:28.877 --> 19:30.993
You want to talk?
Talk to Hershel.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.753
I'm doing stuff, Lori.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.915
"Things."
Isn't that enough?

19:40.638 --> 19:43.095
I'm still here.

19:43.266 --> 19:46.303
You're right.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.389
I'm sorry.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.960
(shop bell rings)

20:24.516 --> 20:26.882
( growls )

20:44.702 --> 20:46.954
( growls )

21:06.599 --> 21:09.090
(gurgling)

21:12.730 --> 21:14.937
Ready?

21:19.946 --> 21:21.777
Rick:
Daryl.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.614
Come on.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.455
Get tight!
Get tight!

21:33.626 --> 21:35.127
(shouting )

21:35.295 --> 21:38.128
- Come on, over here!
- Hey! Over here!

21:56.649 --> 21:59.812
(shouting )

21:59.986 --> 22:02.193
- Don't break rank!
- We need that.

22:02.363 --> 22:05.400
T! T!

22:05.575 --> 22:08.817
- Maggie! Maggie!
- ( grunts)

22:08.995 --> 22:10.986
Rick:
Almost there.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.876
Shit.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.262
(growling)

22:43.321 --> 22:44.731
I can't see them.
Can you see them?

22:54.582 --> 22:56.789
Daryl!

23:05.760 --> 23:08.046
- Come on.
- We're good.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.423
(growling)

23:18.189 --> 23:19.520
See that?

23:30.451 --> 23:32.703
(snarling )

23:54.309 --> 23:56.470
Stop.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.971
Well, it looks secure.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.936
Not from the look
of that courtyard over there.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.101
And that's a civilian.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.941
So the interior could be
overrun with walkers

24:09.115 --> 24:11.071
from outside the prison.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.233
Well, if there's walls down,
what are we gonna do?

24:13.411 --> 24:14.947
We can't rebuild
this whole place.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.782
We can't risk a blind spot.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.282
We have to push in.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.399
( door squeaks)

25:04.671 --> 25:06.878
(water dripping)

26:51.903 --> 26:53.894
( loud clang )

27:00.912 --> 27:03.528
(growling)

27:26.354 --> 27:28.561
- What do you think?
- Home sweet home.

27:28.731 --> 27:30.972
Rick:
For the time being.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.311
lt's secure?

27:33.486 --> 27:36.023
This cellblock is.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.484
What about the rest
of the prison?

27:39.659 --> 27:42.651
In the morning, we'll find
the cafeteria and infirmary.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.490
We sleep in the cells?

27:44.664 --> 27:47.747
I found keys on some guards.
Daryl has a set, too.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.578
Daryl:
I ain't sleeping in no cage.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.708
I'll take the perch.

27:53.464 --> 27:55.329
Come on.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.092
Thank you.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.841
Pretty gross.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.136
Yeah, remember
the storage units?

28:10.314 --> 28:12.691
It's actually--
it's actually comfortable.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.474
Check it out.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.440
You find your cell yet?

28:22.618 --> 28:26.031
Yeah, I was just making
sure Beth was safe.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.201
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.081
( chuckles )

28:34.714 --> 28:37.205
I'm so exhausted,
I don't even care.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.757
Here, let me see.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.223
What you doing?

28:47.393 --> 28:49.759
Checking for scratches.

29:05.453 --> 29:09.037
J‘ lt's late in the night... J‘

29:13.127 --> 29:15.743
- You're okay.
- J‘ Late in the night J‘

29:15.922 --> 29:18.254
J‘ For a storm J‘

29:22.428 --> 29:25.261
J‘ lt's quiet again J‘

29:29.602 --> 29:32.093
J‘ Too much for noise J‘

29:32.271 --> 29:35.980
J‘ To go home J‘

29:38.945 --> 29:42.278
J‘ To fill up the space J‘

29:45.993 --> 29:52.580
J‘ To fill up the rooms
on Sunday afternoon. J‘

30:27.660 --> 30:29.992
(growling)

30:50.516 --> 30:51.847
What are you doing
out here?

30:52.018 --> 30:54.134
I needed some light.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.181
( groans )

31:07.783 --> 31:09.068
Take this.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.673
How is it out there?

31:33.851 --> 31:36.058
Same.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.684
lt's quiet.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.394
You're lying.

31:43.986 --> 31:46.272
We should go
in a few days.

31:50.201 --> 31:52.283
They're coming.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.571
- You should go.
- No.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.865
l'll hold you back. Go.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.750
I can take care of myself.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.082
I saved your ass
all winter, didn't I?

32:07.468 --> 32:10.585
(coughing)

32:18.062 --> 32:19.927
I won't have you
dying for me.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.817
Good soldier
won't leave your post.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.565
Screw you.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.537
We'll go in a few days.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.626
If we stay...

32:49.301 --> 32:52.168
l'll die here.

33:11.699 --> 33:14.315
(gurgling)

33:31.010 --> 33:32.716
Not bad.

33:32.887 --> 33:37.005
Flashbangs,
CS Triple-Chasers.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.094
Not sure how
they'd work on walkers,

33:39.268 --> 33:40.633
but we'll take 'em.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.804
I ain't wearing this shit.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.188
We could boil 'em.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.644
Ain't enough firewood
in the whole forest. No.

33:48.819 --> 33:51.196
Besides, we made it this
far without 'em, right?

33:52.656 --> 33:55.033
Carol:
Hershel.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.486
Everything all right?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.946
Yeah.
Nothing to worry about.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.036
It's the baby.
I think I lost it.

34:08.214 --> 34:10.830
- You haven't felt it move?
- Nothing.

34:11.008 --> 34:12.919
And no Braxton-Hicks.

34:13.093 --> 34:15.675
At first I thought it was exhaustion
or malnutrition.

34:15.846 --> 34:19.179
You're anemic?

34:19.350 --> 34:23.059
If we're all infected,
then so's the baby.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.390
So what if it's stillborn?

34:25.564 --> 34:28.101
What if it's dead
inside me right now?

34:28.275 --> 34:30.061
- What if it rips me apart?
- Stop.

34:30.236 --> 34:33.103
Don't let your fear
take control of you.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.690
(sniffling )
Okay.

34:34.865 --> 34:37.823
Then let's say it lives
and I die during childbirth.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.530
- That's not going to happen.
- Why not?

34:40.704 --> 34:44.322
How many women died in childbirth
before modern medicine?

34:46.543 --> 34:49.000
If I come back,

34:49.171 --> 34:51.583
what if I attack it?

34:51.757 --> 34:54.248
Or you? Or Rick?

34:54.426 --> 34:55.927
Or Carl?

34:56.095 --> 34:58.086
If I do,
if there is any chance,

34:58.264 --> 34:59.925
you put me down
immediately.

35:00.099 --> 35:03.762
You don't hesitate.
Me, the baby,

35:06.355 --> 35:09.438
you don't hesitate
and you don't try to save us.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.439
Okay?

35:19.285 --> 35:20.616
It might have
been better if--

35:20.786 --> 35:23.118
- If what?
- ( exhales )

35:23.289 --> 35:25.530
I'd never made it
off the farm.

35:25.708 --> 35:28.791
You're exhausted,
frightened.

35:28.961 --> 35:30.417
Yeah, that's true.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.624
My son can't stand me.

35:36.802 --> 35:40.340
And my husband,
after what I put him through...

35:41.765 --> 35:43.756
We've all been carrying
that weight.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.219
All winter.

35:45.394 --> 35:46.634
I tried to talk to him.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.518
He...

35:48.689 --> 35:51.055
He'll come around.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.936
He hates me.

35:57.114 --> 36:00.777
He's too good a man
to say it, but I know.

36:02.202 --> 36:04.818
I put him and Shane at odds.
I put that knife in his hand.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.534
(crying)

36:09.835 --> 36:12.793
You know who doesn't
give a shit about that?

36:14.131 --> 36:16.998
- This baby.
- ( chuckles )

36:17.176 --> 36:20.088
Now let's make sure
everything's all right.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.689
You won't need that.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.855
I need you to stay put.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.194
- You're kidding.
- We don't know what's in there.

36:43.369 --> 36:46.202
Something goes wrong,
you could be the last man standing.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.408
I need you to
handle things here.

36:48.582 --> 36:50.197
Sure.

36:50.376 --> 36:53.709
Great. Let's go.

37:07.851 --> 37:10.433
( lock clicks)

37:54.731 --> 37:56.767
(spray can hissing )

38:02.114 --> 38:03.775
( shrieks )

38:03.949 --> 38:05.905
( softly )
Sorry.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.982
(spraying )

38:55.334 --> 38:57.199
(loudthud)

39:02.007 --> 39:03.463
(growling)

39:03.634 --> 39:05.966
- Go back. Go back! Move!
- Walkers!

39:12.351 --> 39:13.340
Let's go.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.601
This way.

39:18.148 --> 39:20.355
- ( screams)
- Whoa. Whoa. Go, go, go.

39:20.526 --> 39:21.766
Come on.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.399
Come on, this way.

39:31.662 --> 39:33.573
ln here!

39:41.213 --> 39:44.330
- Where's Glenn and Maggie?
- We have to go back.

39:44.508 --> 39:46.464
But which way?

40:01.149 --> 40:03.401
Maggie? Glenn?

40:10.075 --> 40:12.942
- Glenn: Rick?
- Maggie: Dad?

40:14.496 --> 40:16.077
Daddy?

40:18.208 --> 40:20.585
Mag?

40:20.752 --> 40:23.585
Mag?

40:25.841 --> 40:27.923
(screaming )

40:29.595 --> 40:32.086
No!

40:32.264 --> 40:34.129
(wailing)

40:34.308 --> 40:36.264
- No!
- Maggie!

40:36.435 --> 40:38.141
Daddy!

40:40.230 --> 40:42.391
- Daryl!
- Oh, God, help me!

40:44.776 --> 40:46.357
- Glenn!
- We're blocked!

40:46.528 --> 40:49.190
Get back! Get back!
Go! Go!

40:49.364 --> 40:51.275
- Hershel: Oh, God! Oh, God.
- Rick: Hold on.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.403
Break 'em open.
Open the door!

41:01.209 --> 41:02.949
Get in!

41:03.128 --> 41:05.210
Shut the door!

41:09.343 --> 41:11.629
You got it?
Have you got it?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.304
( Hershel whimpering )

41:16.933 --> 41:18.434
Hurry up!

41:21.772 --> 41:24.434
Hold him down.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.654
All right.

41:39.665 --> 41:41.280
Only one way
to keep you alive.

41:42.793 --> 41:44.829
( Hershel yells )

41:59.559 --> 42:02.016
Oh!

42:05.524 --> 42:07.606
He's bleeding out.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.981
( whispers )
Duck.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.448
Holy shit.

42:22.958 --> 42:23.071
(theme music playing )

42:23.083 --> 42:25.495
(theme music playing )
