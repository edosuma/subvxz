-Hi, Dorothy.
-Hi, Ma.

00:59.333 --> 01:03.133
Why are you wearing a raincoat?
It's 80 degrees.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.667
I had a chill.

01:04.734 --> 01:06.533
I have another question.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.300
Are you wearing a saber
under your coat?

01:11.333 --> 01:13.567
Yeah. See ya later.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.367
Take off the coat.

01:20.066 --> 01:23.300
Did you forget to take
your blood pressure medicine?

01:23.967 --> 01:26.700
Got a job at captain Jack's
seafood shanty.

01:26.767 --> 01:28.400
-Why?
-I need money.

01:28.467 --> 01:29.900
I give you money.

01:29.967 --> 01:33.000
You give me an allowance.
Do I look like Dennis the menace?

01:33.734 --> 01:38.000
You're 81. Working in
a fast-food place is too much.

01:38.066 --> 01:39.500
I forbid it.

01:39.567 --> 01:43.233
Really, warden? Sending me back
to that old folks' home?

01:43.300 --> 01:47.166
Shady pines is a beautiful
retirement village.

01:47.233 --> 01:51.000
Right, and Morley safer
wandered in by mistake.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.333
Dorothy,
we have great news!

01:57.400 --> 01:59.266
You'll never guess
who we got to star

01:59.333 --> 02:01.066
in this year's production
at the community theater.

02:01.133 --> 02:04.700
Blanche, you say that every year,
and every year,

02:04.767 --> 02:08.700
we end up with Miami's answer
to Meryl Streep, Phyllis Hammerow.

02:08.767 --> 02:09.867
She stinks.

02:09.934 --> 02:13.533
She was terrific last year
in "the diary of Anne Frank."

02:13.600 --> 02:16.467
Rose, during the entire second act,

02:16.533 --> 02:20.100
the audience kept yelling,
"she's in the attic!"

02:23.300 --> 02:27.266
Well, this year, we happen to have
gotten a real actor,

02:27.333 --> 02:29.800
a
star of incredible magnitude.

02:29.867 --> 02:32.867
Dorothy, the Miami community players

02:32.934 --> 02:36.133
will have the extraordinary
experience of working with

02:36.200 --> 02:40.233
none other than the incandescent...
Mr. Patrick Vaughn.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.834
Patrick Vaughn.
Oh, my God!

02:43.900 --> 02:47.633
He is my all-time favorite TV actor!

02:47.700 --> 02:49.233
Ha-ha-ha!

02:49.300 --> 02:54.100
I cannot believe I'll actually
meet Patrick Vaughn!

02:54.166 --> 02:55.700
I've had a crush
on him for years.

02:55.767 --> 02:58.700
He is the sexiest actor on TV.

02:58.767 --> 03:02.066
I hate to admit it,
but he melts my Haagen-Dazs.

03:04.066 --> 03:05.834
Rose, you tramp.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.400
I'll see you later.
I'm going to work.

03:12.133 --> 03:15.166
Ma, I absolutely forbid you
to leave this house.

03:15.233 --> 03:16.900
I'm going to work.

03:16.967 --> 03:18.400
Over my dead body.

03:18.467 --> 03:19.967
Fine.
Have it your way.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.467
Go. I'm tired of
arguing with you.

03:25.533 --> 03:31.066
Sophia, are you wearing a captain
Jack's seafood shanty uniform?

03:31.133 --> 03:34.066
No, Rose. I'm off to discover
the straits of Magellan.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.033
Yo-ho.

03:44.900 --> 03:48.066
Dorothy,
is this a good champagne?

03:48.133 --> 03:49.667
Gee, it's hard to tell.

03:49.734 --> 03:53.266
The discount sticker is covering
the year of the vintage.

03:55.433 --> 03:59.967
Well, I'm sorry, but the
welcoming committee is on a budget.

04:00.033 --> 04:02.000
Hurry up and arrange those flowers.

04:02.066 --> 04:05.033
Mr. Vaughn's arriving any minute.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.633
-(knock on door)
-Oh, my God, that's him.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.867
-How does the dressing room look?
-How do I look?

04:10.934 --> 04:13.967
Welcome mister...
Ma!

04:14.033 --> 04:16.200
-Thanks, Dorothy.
-Give me those!

04:17.834 --> 04:19.266
What are you doing here?

04:19.333 --> 04:22.700
Killing an hour before work.
I came to meet Mr. Hollywood.

04:22.767 --> 04:24.133
You can't stay.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.934
Why, you're embarrassed
by your own mother?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.166
When she's dressed
like Vasco Da Gama, yes.

04:31.467 --> 04:33.400
Excuse me.
Am I in the right place?

04:33.467 --> 04:36.100
Oh, wow!
Are you ever.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.767
Allow me to introduce myself.

04:37.834 --> 04:40.367
I'm Patrick Vaughn.

04:43.667 --> 04:47.033
Rose. Look, Rose,
it's... it's our...

04:47.100 --> 04:50.533
he's... I...
we... ooh...

04:50.600 --> 04:53.000
This is my daughter Dorothy.
She's an English teacher.

04:54.266 --> 04:56.734
-And you are...
-Linda Ronstadt.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.867
I'm doing "The Pirates of Penzance"
across town.

05:03.633 --> 05:07.066
This is my mother, Sophia Petrillo,
who has to be going.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.800
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.867
Mr. Vaughn,
my name is Blanche Devereaux.

05:13.934 --> 05:18.600
Blanche.
And this is Rose Nylund.

05:18.667 --> 05:19.900
Rose.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.767
And this over here
is Dorothy Zbornak.

05:24.834 --> 05:25.800
Dorothy.

05:25.867 --> 05:30.133
We're so excited that an artist
of your stature

05:30.200 --> 05:32.934
is going to be performing
in our little theater.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.367
Ladies, there are no small theaters,
no small parts, only small actors.

05:37.433 --> 05:39.500
Like Herve Villechaize.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.333
I was speaking metaphorically.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.900
Oh, please, go on.

05:44.967 --> 05:46.934
That's such a beautiful language.

05:48.166 --> 05:51.166
Why don't we just show Mr. Vaughn
around the theater?

05:51.233 --> 05:56.166
I'll do that, since I've had the
most experience performing here.

05:56.233 --> 05:58.934
Blanche, the parking
lot doesn't count. I'll do it.

06:04.633 --> 06:05.500
I want to do it.

06:05.567 --> 06:08.500
Ladies,
I don't have the time now.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.600
I'm doing another project in town.

06:10.667 --> 06:13.166
I have to meet with the director
to discuss the nuances

06:13.233 --> 06:14.667
of the character I'll be portraying.

06:14.734 --> 06:16.033
I read about that.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.900
Aren't you playing a tangerine
in a commercial?

06:20.200 --> 06:21.500
Yes.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.200
How exciting!

06:23.266 --> 06:25.000
Have you ever been
a fruit before?

06:27.867 --> 06:30.300
No, but having been
in the musical theater for 30 years,

06:30.367 --> 06:32.400
I've had my share of offers.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.734
It was a delight
meeting all of you.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.100
-Casting is tomorrow at 2 o'clock.
-I'm looking forward to it.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.633
I trust all of you will read
for the part of my leading lady.

06:51.233 --> 06:53.667
To hell with this town.
Come away with me.

06:54.934 --> 06:57.333
But, Biff, you're a drifter.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.867
How can I just pull up stakes
and run off with you?

07:01.934 --> 07:06.066
Please reconsider, Josie. You're
the prettiest girl in the county.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.467
Shut up.

07:12.734 --> 07:14.200
Go on, Biff.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.633
I need your answer, Josie.
What's it gonna be?

07:19.233 --> 07:21.266
I want you to take me, Biff.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.433
Right here on this stage.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.333
Pardon me?

07:29.400 --> 07:33.133
Oh...
I'm sorry, that was an adlib.

07:37.533 --> 07:39.000
Blanche Devereaux.

07:41.667 --> 07:42.800
Just a moment.

07:53.633 --> 07:55.533
Oh, my God!

07:58.633 --> 08:00.834
My rear tires have
less pressure in them.

08:05.734 --> 08:06.867
I'm ready.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.834
The moon is hanging low
in the sky tonight,

08:12.900 --> 08:14.367
isn't it, busty...

08:15.633 --> 08:17.467
Josie?

08:17.533 --> 08:19.700
It sure is, Biff.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.400
It makes me want to kiss you,
Josie.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.433
Mind your manners, Biff.

08:23.500 --> 08:27.000
The whole town
is at this picnic with us.

08:27.066 --> 08:29.066
Forget this town.
Come away with me.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.967
But you're a drifter, Biff.

08:31.033 --> 08:33.567
I can't just run off with you.

08:33.633 --> 08:35.600
Please reconsider, Josie.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.333
You're the prettiest
girl in the county.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.533
I need to have your answer.
What's it going to be?

08:42.066 --> 08:45.000
I want you to take me, Biff.
Oh!

08:45.066 --> 08:46.166
(hiss)

08:46.233 --> 08:50.100
Oh, oh, oh!

08:50.166 --> 08:51.834
Blanche, I'm sorry.

08:58.266 --> 09:00.133
I'm afraid
I popped your bosom.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.200
Don't you worry
about a thing, Patrick.

09:04.266 --> 09:06.967
My backup pair can take
a lot more punishment.

09:11.166 --> 09:13.333
You made a complete
fool of yourself.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.734
Just wait and see
who gets the part.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.200
Could I have everyone's attention?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.166
We had to make some
very difficult choices,

09:20.233 --> 09:25.533
but remember, and I mean this,
everyone here is a star.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.333
Playing the part of Josie
will be Phyllis Hammerow.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.100
The sheriff will be
played by Ronald Bromberg.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.700
The rest of you will be
nonspeaking townspeople.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.300
Thank you very much.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.567
I don't believe it.
Phyllis hammerow.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.100
I am stunned!

09:44.166 --> 09:47.300
-He didn't like any one of us.
-Let's get out of here.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.500
I'll meet you girls at the car.
I forgot my purse.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.033
Blanche.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.400
Yes, Judas?

10:04.800 --> 10:08.266
-You're mad you didn't get the part.
-Was Phyllis really better than me?

10:08.333 --> 10:11.500
Much better but you are
a more attractive woman.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.033
What's your point?

10:13.100 --> 10:14.700
I've never done this before.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.433
I hardly know you,

10:16.500 --> 10:19.467
but would you consider having
dinner with me tonight?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.133
Why, yes.

10:23.033 --> 10:25.066
Yes.

10:26.567 --> 10:28.066
Wait till my friends
hear about this.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.300
For now,
this must be our secret.

10:30.367 --> 10:33.867
I'm in the middle of
a rather messy divorce--

10:33.934 --> 10:35.633
Say no more.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.967
I'm not naive about these things.

10:38.033 --> 10:40.967
I have a subscription
to "people" magazine.

10:41.033 --> 10:45.133
Well, then, until tonight
at 8 o'clock.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.633
See you later, Boff...

10:51.800 --> 10:52.600
Biff...

10:53.767 --> 10:55.000
Patrick. Ha-ha!

10:57.834 --> 10:59.567
Blanche, come on.

11:00.066 --> 11:03.500
-Oh, hi, Mr. Vaughn.
-Please, call me Patrick.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.533
Rose, there's been something
I've wanted to ask you all day.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.000
Mine are real.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.266
That's not what
I wanted to ask you,

11:17.333 --> 11:18.800
but that is good to know.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.633
Rose, ever since we met,

11:21.700 --> 11:24.533
I felt there was something
between us.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.800
Would you have dinner
with me tonight?

11:27.934 --> 11:29.633
Jeepers, yes!

11:29.700 --> 11:31.600
Wait till Blanche and Dorothy
hear about this.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.567
It'll have to be our secret.

11:33.633 --> 11:36.367
I'm in the middle
of a messy divorce.

11:36.433 --> 11:40.266
Oh, I understand.
I read "people" magazine.

11:41.100 --> 11:45.166
Well, then, until tonight
at 10 o'clock.

11:50.166 --> 11:51.600
I don't know
what you just did,

11:51.667 --> 11:54.533
but you'd make
one hell of a yodeler.

11:58.066 --> 12:00.700
Blanche, Rose! Oh, hello.

12:00.767 --> 12:01.867
Dorothy, I'm glad you're here.

12:01.934 --> 12:06.767
I want to ask you, one,
do you read "people" magazine?

12:08.066 --> 12:11.166
And two, are you doing anything
tonight around midnight?

12:23.867 --> 12:26.200
It's been a wonderful afternoon.

12:26.266 --> 12:27.734
It's been a wonderful week.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.433
Patrick, our relationship's so
special, I can't keep it a secret.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.200
It's hard on me too.

12:35.266 --> 12:38.834
When the time's right,
I'll write it in the sky.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.667
Oh. Patrick, sit down.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.834
I want to make a confession.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.233
I've never told this to anyone,
but...

12:47.734 --> 12:49.033
I'm not perfect.

12:50.734 --> 12:53.934
-Blanche.
-I mean it. Look in my left eye.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.533
What do you see?

12:59.600 --> 13:01.700
Sleep crust in the corner.

13:02.734 --> 13:07.700
In the center.
There's a slight flaw in my iris.

13:08.467 --> 13:09.500
Oh, yes.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.133
-Blanche.
-Patrick.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.767
Dorothy,
what are you doing here?

13:13.834 --> 13:14.800
I live here.

13:14.867 --> 13:18.133
-You're Blanche's roommate?
-Yes. What's going on?

13:18.200 --> 13:22.033
Patrick was helping me rehearse
my part in the play.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.567
Rehearse what?

13:23.633 --> 13:25.834
You're a nonspeaking
townsperson.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.700
We added a stunt.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.000
Blanche gets tossed
to the floor. Watch.

13:32.367 --> 13:33.567
Oh!

13:35.600 --> 13:37.467
I'm getting the hang of that.

13:37.533 --> 13:40.867
I'll go out in the backyard
and practice it on the lawn.

13:41.734 --> 13:43.667
What's really going on here?

13:43.734 --> 13:46.467
I made up that excuse
hoping to run into you.

13:46.533 --> 13:49.667
Thank goodness it worked.
I've really missed you.

13:49.734 --> 13:52.533
What do you think,
I'm some kind of idiot?

13:52.600 --> 13:55.633
You just said you didn't know
Blanche and I were roommates.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.867
-That's right, and she believed it.
-Oh, God, you're a wonderful actor.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.900
There's no acting involved
when I'm around you, Dorothy.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.467
This week's been incredible.

14:04.533 --> 14:08.300
Oh, let's tell everyone
how we feel about each other.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.500
(door rattles)

14:14.033 --> 14:16.433
Patrick,
what are you doing here?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.066
Dorothy, what are you
doing on the floor?

14:20.567 --> 14:23.600
I dropped a contact.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.333
You expect me to believe that?

14:25.400 --> 14:27.266
You don't wear contacts.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.300
She dropped my contact.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.467
I ran into Dorothy downtown.

14:31.533 --> 14:34.400
I told her I'd run out of
contact solution.

14:34.467 --> 14:37.667
She said she had plenty of it here
because she doesn't wear them.

14:38.767 --> 14:40.133
So here we are.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.633
Oh! Ok.

14:43.934 --> 14:45.667
Here it is.
I found it.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.734
-You found what?
-The lens.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.033
I'll rinse it in the solution
that we have too much of.

14:54.033 --> 14:55.867
Thank goodness you're here.

14:55.934 --> 15:00.700
I made up that ridiculous
explanation hoping I'd run into you.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.867
So you live here too, huh?

15:02.934 --> 15:05.767
Yes, but why would
you ask if I live here--

15:05.834 --> 15:07.867
Oh, kiss me, Rose.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.767
Go easy, Patrick.
It's not a toy.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.900
Well, I have to go,
but we're still on for tonight?

15:16.967 --> 15:17.934
Oh, you betcha.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.633
Same rendezvous as last night.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.967
10:45, you'll pull your car up
behind the theater

15:23.033 --> 15:24.400
and leave the trunk open.

15:25.934 --> 15:28.000
Right. Goodbye.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.633
Patrick, you're leaving so soon?

15:30.700 --> 15:33.100
-I'm afraid so.
-I'll see you tonight.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.567
-At the theater.
-Yes, just at the theater.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.400
I must take my leave.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.667
Don't leave your lens.

15:41.734 --> 15:44.033
Oh, my lens!

15:47.667 --> 15:48.533
Oh!

15:49.700 --> 15:53.066
I think maybe
I'd better put it in now.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.600
There. That's better.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.333
Farewell.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.533
God, he's good.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.967
Have you seen
Patrick?

16:16.033 --> 16:17.467
Blanche, have you seen Patrick?

16:17.533 --> 16:19.600
No. Who's the flower for?

16:19.667 --> 16:24.000
I'm giving Patrick a Rose for good
luck since it's opening night.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.033
I'll do it.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.266
Why should you?

16:26.333 --> 16:28.900
Haven't you heard that
old theatrical saying?

16:28.967 --> 16:29.800
No.

16:29.867 --> 16:33.200
"Never accept a Rose from somebody
named Rose on opening night."

16:34.500 --> 16:35.367
Evening, ladies.

16:35.433 --> 16:36.567
-Hello, Patrick.
-Hello, Patrick.

16:36.633 --> 16:39.533
This is in honor
of opening night.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.500
Why, thank you, Blanche.
That's very thoughtful.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.900
I'd have gotten you a Rose too,
if my mother had named me violet.

16:47.533 --> 16:50.800
Mr. Vaughn, did you hear about
the cast change?

16:50.867 --> 16:54.600
-Cast change?
-Ronald Bromberg has the flu.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.133
He can't play the sheriff.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.533
Who can play the part?

16:57.600 --> 16:58.667
Hello.

17:00.967 --> 17:04.567
She's the only one in the cast
who fits into the costume.

17:05.533 --> 17:07.800
Dorothy, we better run the lines.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.967
Isn't he the greatest?

17:11.033 --> 17:14.600
Yeah. The great ones
always throw in a back rub.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.033
-What?
-Have either of you seen Patrick?

17:17.100 --> 17:19.967
-Yes. He's rehearsing lines.
-Why do you want him?

17:20.033 --> 17:22.700
-I want to give him this.
-I'll give it to him.

17:23.934 --> 17:26.200
He'd rather get it from me.

17:26.266 --> 17:28.600
He's been getting it
from me all week.

17:29.867 --> 17:30.867
What?

17:31.367 --> 17:34.433
Patrick swore me to secrecy,
but I've got to tell someone.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.867
We're madly in love.

17:35.934 --> 17:38.467
We've been seeing each other
since he got here.

17:38.533 --> 17:40.233
Have a good show.

17:42.433 --> 17:45.567
-Phyllis is such a liar!
-Oh, she sure is.

17:45.633 --> 17:48.300
-Since Patrick got into town...
-He's been seeing me.

17:51.734 --> 17:53.166
Places, everyone.

18:05.233 --> 18:06.400
(applause)

18:10.934 --> 18:13.734
My name's Biff. I'm a drifter.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.300
(harmonica plays)

18:16.367 --> 18:20.100
My story isn't a pretty one,
but it's one that needs to be told.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.467
It was 1952, Wackahatchee,
Mississippi...

18:26.333 --> 18:29.066
the town 4th of July picnic.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.667
(harmonica plays "Oh, Susannah")

18:46.200 --> 18:47.567
Evening, sheriff.

18:47.633 --> 18:50.166
Evening, fellow Wackahatcheeite.

18:52.734 --> 18:55.834
-Evening, sheriff.
-Evening, Biff.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.467
What you doing here?

18:57.533 --> 18:59.400
The usual. Just drifting.

18:59.467 --> 19:01.667
You stabbed me in the back!

19:01.734 --> 19:04.100
Me? You're the back-stabber.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.800
-Shh!
-Excuse us.

19:09.166 --> 19:12.200
How much longer you planning on
staying in town?

19:12.266 --> 19:13.600
Hard to tell.

19:13.667 --> 19:16.300
Well, I'm gonna
keep my eye on you.

19:19.834 --> 19:23.233
The sun was mighty hot today,
wasn't it, Josie?

19:23.300 --> 19:25.700
It sure was, Biff.

19:27.266 --> 19:31.033
Patrick swore I was the only woman
in his life.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.266
-He told me the same thing.
-Oh, you liar!

19:34.333 --> 19:36.500
He said he'd tell
everybody about us.

19:36.567 --> 19:40.767
He said when the time was right,
he'd rent a plane and--

19:40.834 --> 19:42.934
And write it in the sky?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.800
Yes.

19:44.867 --> 19:47.200
You, sir, are a dirtbag!

19:50.100 --> 19:52.734
Oh, I'm sorry.
It must be the heat.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.166
What are you two doing?

19:56.233 --> 19:59.834
Patrick is in the middle
of an exquisite performance.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.033
You have no idea
how many "performances"

20:02.100 --> 20:04.266
-he's given these last two weeks.
-What?

20:04.333 --> 20:08.734
He's been seeing me, Blanche,
and Phyllis behind our backs.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.300
You're a dirtbag!

20:10.367 --> 20:11.767
Dorothy.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.367
He's been seeing me too.

20:13.433 --> 20:14.633
-What?
-What?

20:14.700 --> 20:17.266
-That man is slime!
-Pond scum.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.467
<i>Gauflugennachon.</i>

20:19.533 --> 20:20.834
What?

20:20.900 --> 20:23.266
<i>Gauflugennachon.</i>

20:23.333 --> 20:26.500
It's Scandinavian for someone
who docks his boat

20:26.567 --> 20:28.333
in a handicapped slip.

20:35.033 --> 20:38.600
It's time that man was exposed
for what he really is.

20:38.667 --> 20:41.033
I'll go tell him off.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.300
I love you, Josie.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.000
You're the only
woman in my life.

20:45.066 --> 20:47.533
That's a sack of
cold chestnuts, mister.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.066
-Blanche.
-Don't Blanche me, you lowlife!

20:50.133 --> 20:54.000
You think you can have your way
with every woman you want?

20:54.066 --> 20:55.834
There was someone besides me?

20:55.900 --> 20:58.467
-Me and Rose.
-And me!

20:58.533 --> 21:00.300
You slept with the sheriff?

21:01.934 --> 21:04.900
Lord knows how many other women
he took advantage of.

21:08.233 --> 21:11.133
Ladies, I can explain,
but now is not the time.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.834
I'll tell you what time it is,
hanging time!

21:13.900 --> 21:15.567
Somebody get me a rope!

21:16.800 --> 21:18.967
And a tree from props!

21:19.033 --> 21:21.600
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let me speak.

21:22.667 --> 21:27.667
All right, I admit I'm guilty,
but what's the big deal?

21:27.734 --> 21:30.367
We all had a good time.

21:30.433 --> 21:33.700
All of you who had a good time,
put your hands back up.

21:36.767 --> 21:39.400
Ed, you damned liar!
Put your hand down!

21:41.233 --> 21:43.700
So what harm did I do?

21:43.767 --> 21:46.266
You lied to everybody.

21:46.333 --> 21:50.667
You, sir, are a low-down
carpetbagging scallywag!

21:50.734 --> 21:54.000
I will never shampoo
your hair again!

21:54.066 --> 21:56.734
And another thing,
you'll never what?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.400
Don't ask.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.667
You know how we all feel,

22:00.734 --> 22:06.500
so get out of our sight, our lives,
and our town right now!

22:09.867 --> 22:11.934
(applause)

22:39.800 --> 22:42.567
-I feel like a fool.
-Me too.

22:42.633 --> 22:44.300
Don't worry, girls.

22:44.367 --> 22:48.066
The audience had fun,
and they got their money back.

22:48.133 --> 22:51.600
That's not what we're talking about,
you titmouse.

22:54.567 --> 22:57.900
We were talking about how humiliated
we were by Patrick.

22:58.467 --> 23:00.166
Oh, you're right.

23:00.667 --> 23:05.767
I feel so common,
so cheap, so used.

23:05.834 --> 23:08.233
How do you usually
deal with that, Blanche?

23:15.266 --> 23:17.867
Rose, just for that, I'm going
to flush the toilet tonight

23:17.934 --> 23:19.633
while you're taking a shower.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.333
It's our own fault.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.333
We behaved like
teenage groupies.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.233
The first good-looking,

23:29.300 --> 23:33.367
sexy, debonair,
charming man that rolls into town,

23:33.433 --> 23:37.333
and we got on him quicker than
mustard on a tie at a county fair.

23:38.934 --> 23:41.367
It's hard to stay mad at the guy.

23:43.066 --> 23:44.367
I don't know, there was...

23:44.834 --> 23:46.600
something special about him.

23:48.133 --> 23:49.767
He made me feel beautiful.

23:51.233 --> 23:52.934
He made me feel young.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.200
He made me feel smart.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.700
God, what an actor.

24:08.767 --> 24:12.633
(theme music playing)
