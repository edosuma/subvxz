WEBVTT

00:00.110 --> 00:02.600
Previously on Young Sheldon...
Well, we've covered

00:03.180 --> 00:04.430
football and grandkids...

00:04.830 --> 00:07.050
Maybe we've run out of
stuff to talk about.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.920
We forgot about your ex-husband.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.130
(laughs) The one
you're dating.

00:11.130 --> 00:14.340
Well, I know not to piss him off
during a hailstorm.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.140
Well, did he tell you
that I was naked

00:16.140 --> 00:17.560
when he locked me out?

00:17.560 --> 00:19.060
(laughing):
What were you doing naked

00:19.060 --> 00:21.270
with a golf club in a hailstorm?

00:21.270 --> 00:24.350
Ah, you know, it was the '70s.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.860
I was just calling to let
you know I read your paper.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.940
The masses for your neutrinos
are impossible.

00:28.940 --> 00:33.110
I completely rewrote the
whole thing from scratch.

00:33.110 --> 00:35.280
I know credits are
usually listed alphabetically,

00:35.280 --> 00:38.280
but I'm completely fine
with my name going second.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.660
I'm not putting your name on it
in any way.

00:40.660 --> 00:41.910
Grant Linkletter.

00:41.910 --> 00:43.920
Dr. Sturgis has stolen my work

00:43.920 --> 00:46.000
and is using it
in his own paper.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.750
How dare you accuse me

00:47.750 --> 00:49.210
of plagiarism!

00:49.210 --> 00:51.050
I don't want to see you
in my class anymore.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.630
(dial tone drones)

00:54.930 --> 00:56.970
MARY:
I see, Dr. Sturgis.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.640
Yes, that is
unforgivable behavior.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.560
Okay. Bye.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.810
Did he apologize?

01:05.810 --> 01:07.480
No. He is very upset with you.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.650
Well, I'm upset with him.

01:09.650 --> 01:11.650
That doesn't excuse you
from trying

01:11.650 --> 01:14.320
to get him in trouble
by calling Dr. Linkletter.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.320
Who else was I supposed
to tattle to?

01:16.320 --> 01:18.490
I doubt his mother's
still alive.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.740
Sheldon, I understand
why you're upset,

01:20.740 --> 01:23.290
but you still owe him
an apology.

01:23.290 --> 01:25.160
Then you don't understand.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.790
Well, for now,
it sounds like you two

01:27.790 --> 01:29.920
could use a little quiet time.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.130
Fine. I'll switch over to
Dr. Linkletter's class.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.840
He's a foot taller
than Sturgis

01:33.840 --> 01:35.840
and can reach more
of the chalkboard.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.050
What I meant was...

01:38.050 --> 01:41.390
maybe it's time to take a break
from your college classes.

01:41.390 --> 01:43.850
What? Why? I've
gotten straight As.

01:43.850 --> 01:46.190
I know you're smart enough
for college.

01:46.190 --> 01:49.480
I'm just not sure
you're mature enough.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.730
Well, it appears you've
backed me into a corner.

01:51.730 --> 01:53.780
I would throw a
tantrum right now,

01:53.780 --> 01:56.110
but that would just
prove your point.

01:57.030 --> 01:58.410
Where are you going?

01:58.410 --> 02:00.280
To play with my trains.

02:00.280 --> 02:03.870
Which may sound immature, but
it's a hobby many old men enjoy.

02:05.290 --> 02:08.170
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:08.170 --> 02:11.340
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

02:11.340 --> 02:13.590
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

02:13.590 --> 02:15.920
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

02:15.920 --> 02:20.140
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

02:23.220 --> 02:25.310
(whistle blows)

02:27.350 --> 02:28.900
(laughing)

02:28.900 --> 02:31.150
I'm the only cheerleader
you should be looking at.

02:31.150 --> 02:33.900
Oh. Hi. Oh, I was
trying to find you.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.490
Just wanted to wish you
a good game.
Thank you.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.110
I'm gonna be cheering for you.

02:38.110 --> 02:40.240
Great.
Unless I catch you
looking at someone else.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.570
Then you'll regret it.

02:41.570 --> 02:42.830
(chuckles)

02:42.830 --> 02:44.830
I'm not kidding.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.040
Hi, George.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.170
Oh, hey, Ms. Hutchins.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.000
I don't think I've ever seen you
at a game before.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.340
Well, uh, it's Friday, and
I promised my therapist

02:55.340 --> 02:58.090
I'd try one new thing a week.
And you picked football.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.760
Good for you.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.180
I don't suppose
Sheldon's here?

03:02.180 --> 03:04.890
Nah, he doesn't much care
for outdoor sports.

03:04.890 --> 03:06.560
Or sports.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.350
Or the outdoors.

03:08.350 --> 03:10.650
I was hoping I'd have
someone to sit with.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.690
Ah, sorry.
That's okay.

03:12.690 --> 03:15.940
It was my fault
for letting myself feel hope.

03:15.940 --> 03:18.780
You're welcome to watch
from the sidelines.

03:18.780 --> 03:21.570
Thanks. Watching life
go by from the sidelines

03:21.570 --> 03:23.740
is kind of my thing.

03:24.490 --> 03:26.120
Hey, heads up!

03:27.870 --> 03:30.120
(whistles blow)
(exclaiming)

03:30.120 --> 03:32.290
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

03:32.290 --> 03:33.840
I don't think so.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.250
Call an ambulance.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.880
Don't worry,

03:36.880 --> 03:38.300
we're gonna get you
taken care of.

03:38.300 --> 03:42.180
If I die,
tell my therapist I hate him.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.470
SHELDON:
And who says

03:44.470 --> 03:46.220
you have to be mature
to go to college?

03:46.220 --> 03:47.560
I've seen Animal House.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.640
You have?
Well, I've seen the poster.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.400
Those people are not
college material.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.480
Moon Pie, I know
you don't like to hear this,

03:54.480 --> 03:56.900
but there are some things
in life

03:56.900 --> 03:59.070
that can only be learned
in time.

03:59.070 --> 04:01.240
So you must have learned
them all, huh?

04:01.240 --> 04:03.660
Get out of my house.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.290
Hang in there.
I'm hangin'.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.370
Hey, this will be quite a story
to tell your grandkids, huh?

04:11.370 --> 04:12.830
I live alone. I'm single.

04:12.830 --> 04:14.880
I don't think grandkids are
in the picture.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.880
Oh. Well, I...
I got a wife, kids. It's...

04:17.880 --> 04:19.670
It's overrated.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.880
And then my mother said

04:21.880 --> 04:23.840
I wasn't mature enough
for college.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.300
Can you believe that?

04:25.300 --> 04:26.890
Absolutely.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.470
So you're on their side, too?

04:28.470 --> 04:30.520
I'm Vietnamese.
In my culture,

04:30.520 --> 04:31.980
until your parents die,

04:31.980 --> 04:34.270
you're basically a baby.
Really?

04:34.270 --> 04:36.900
My grandmother still treats
my dad like a child.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.190
At dinner,
he can't sit

04:38.190 --> 04:39.650
until she sits,

04:39.650 --> 04:41.940
and he can't speak
until he's spoken to.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.070
Well, I'm glad
I'm not Vietnamese.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.820
It's not as fun
as I make it look.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.530
Mm.

04:47.530 --> 04:51.040
Well, you can't bring her home
to an empty apartment.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.620
Bring her here,
and we'll look after her

04:52.620 --> 04:53.960
until she's back on her feet.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.210
You sure?

04:55.210 --> 04:56.460
Of course.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.750
We'll set her up
in Georgie's room.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.500
Thanks, Mare.
See you in a bit.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.210
Hey, George.

05:01.210 --> 05:04.800
It's real nice of you,
taking care of her like this.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.720
Well, it was kinda my fault.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.680
Kinda? It was all your fault.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.390
Bye.

05:10.390 --> 05:11.890
Hey.

05:11.890 --> 05:14.140
Hey. How'd we do?

05:14.140 --> 05:16.150
You didn't miss anything.
That bad?

05:16.150 --> 05:18.690
I can safely say you saw
the best hit of the night.

05:18.690 --> 05:20.400
(sighs):
Whew.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.780
How's she doing?

05:21.780 --> 05:23.860
Well, not bad.

05:23.860 --> 05:25.450
Could be worse.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.950
A little whiplash,

05:27.950 --> 05:29.950
couple of bruised ribs,

05:29.950 --> 05:31.580
broken arm...

05:31.580 --> 05:33.330
and collarbone.

05:33.330 --> 05:35.000
But that's it.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.500
Pretty funny
how you jumped out of the way

05:36.500 --> 05:37.750
and let her get clobbered.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.250
I did not jump out of the way!

05:39.250 --> 05:40.500
Oh, yeah, you did.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.090
(chuckles):
They got you on tape.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.380
Okay, fine.

05:43.380 --> 05:46.050
But that was
pure instinct.

05:46.050 --> 05:49.010
Besides, she shouldn't have
been standing on the sidelines.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.350
Why was she there?

05:51.390 --> 05:53.180
I told her she could.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.100
(laughing):
Oh, man, you must feel terrible.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.350
Yeah, of course I do.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.520
I mean, it's all on you.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.110
You done?

06:00.110 --> 06:03.690
Oh-ho-ho, baby,
I'm just getting started.

06:06.280 --> 06:09.570
Oh, you poor dear.
Come on in.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.660
Thanks. I hope
I'm not putting you out.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.240
Of course not.

06:14.370 --> 06:16.120
Hi, Sheldon.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.130
Can you believe my mother
said I can't go to college?

06:24.690 --> 06:27.480
So you just put her in my room
without consulting me?

06:27.480 --> 06:28.860
Consulting you?

06:28.860 --> 06:30.400
Who cares what you think?

06:30.400 --> 06:31.740
Well, I ain't gonna
sleep on the couch.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.030
It's just for a few nights

06:33.030 --> 06:34.700
until she can take care
of herself.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.910
Can I at least
stay at Meemaw's?

06:36.910 --> 06:38.870
If you promise
not to come back.

06:38.870 --> 06:41.040
Why you got to be so mean to me?

06:41.040 --> 06:43.120
It just feels right.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.370
(sighs)

06:46.080 --> 06:48.040
And then after Dr. Sturgis
incorporated my math,

06:48.040 --> 06:50.340
he refused to give me
a coauthor credit.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.760
Sheldon, she doesn't want
to hear about that.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.220
It's okay.

06:54.220 --> 06:56.760
So, when your bones broke,
did you hear a crunch?

06:56.760 --> 06:58.390
No.

06:58.390 --> 07:01.390
Did my dad have to give you
mouth-to-mouth?
No.

07:01.390 --> 07:04.310
I don't know how
my mom kisses him.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.560
Next up, we have this rose..

07:07.560 --> 07:10.020
Who buys this crap?

07:10.020 --> 07:12.030
Me, after three beers.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.150
I mean, look
at this damn thing.

07:14.150 --> 07:16.320
What was I thinking?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.570
(chuckles)

07:17.570 --> 07:19.240
(infomercial continues)

07:19.240 --> 07:21.080
Can I ask you a
personal question?

07:21.080 --> 07:22.620
You're not in my will.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.120
It's about my girlfriend.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.370
Uh-oh.

07:25.370 --> 07:26.830
Uh, nothing bad.

07:26.830 --> 07:29.090
It's just, I've been seeing Jana
for a while now,

07:29.090 --> 07:31.050
and I like her fine...

07:31.050 --> 07:34.380
but it feels like she's getting
more serious than I want to be.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.260
Georgie, until you're married,

07:37.260 --> 07:39.550
you are not tied down
to anybody.

07:39.550 --> 07:42.100
You just go ahead
and do whatever you want.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.350
Play the field.
Have some fun.

07:44.350 --> 07:46.020
Interesting.

07:46.020 --> 07:48.310
That's what
Dale said, too.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.650
Oh, did he?

07:50.650 --> 07:52.570
Yeah.

07:52.570 --> 07:54.400
My boyfriend?

07:54.400 --> 07:56.030
(chuckles):
Yeah.

07:57.780 --> 07:59.200
SHELDON:
If I don't go

07:59.200 --> 08:00.870
to college, what am
I supposed to do?

08:00.870 --> 08:02.870
Spend all my days
in high school?

08:02.870 --> 08:04.290
How sad is that?

08:04.290 --> 08:06.750
Pretty sad.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.370
You always did get me.

08:08.370 --> 08:10.880
Sounds like you're
feeling misunderstood.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.340
I am-- by Dr. Sturgis,
my mother,

08:13.340 --> 08:16.670
and possibly
the entire Vietnamese culture.

08:16.670 --> 08:21.390
Do you understand that I'm in
a little bit of pain right now?

08:21.390 --> 08:24.060
Oh, I'm sorry. I should be
exhibiting compassion.

08:24.060 --> 08:25.310
Aw.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.850
Wait, I can do better.

08:26.850 --> 08:28.140
Aw.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.690
Nailed it.

08:29.690 --> 08:31.230
It's time for
your pain pill.

08:31.230 --> 08:32.940
Be careful.
You could become addicted

08:32.940 --> 08:34.190
and lose your job.

08:34.190 --> 08:35.490
Which is all you have.

08:35.490 --> 08:37.490
(sighs)
Get out of here.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.160
Thank you.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.370
(groans)
You-you comfortable?

08:42.370 --> 08:44.240
Can I get you anything else?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.540
No. I-I'm okay.

08:46.540 --> 08:48.870
You've been so kind
to welcome me

08:48.870 --> 08:50.170
into your home.

08:50.170 --> 08:51.630
Well, it's the least
we could do.

08:51.630 --> 08:55.170
It's so nice
to be around a family like this.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.300
(crying):
I've been alone

08:59.300 --> 09:02.010
for... so long.

09:02.010 --> 09:05.010
Honestly, if it weren't
for the cats, I'd have no one.

09:05.010 --> 09:07.390
Oh, wait. The cats!

09:07.390 --> 09:09.600
I abandoned Edgar and Allan.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.980
Edgar and Allan?

09:10.980 --> 09:12.770
Poe ran away.

09:12.770 --> 09:15.400
Would you please go feed them
and tell them I love them?

09:15.400 --> 09:18.530
Uh... any chance this
could wait till morning?

09:18.530 --> 09:20.660
(crying):
I guess.

09:22.950 --> 09:24.330
Where you off to?

09:24.330 --> 09:26.490
Cats!

09:26.490 --> 09:28.500
So you think he's seeing
somebody else?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.790
I don't think I should
be talking about this.

09:30.790 --> 09:34.040
He's my boss.
Well, he's my boyfriend,
so spill it.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.340
It's weird when old
people say "boyfriend."

09:37.340 --> 09:40.260
Fine. My lover.

09:40.260 --> 09:41.510
Well, that's worse.

09:41.510 --> 09:42.890
Then talk!

09:42.890 --> 09:45.140
The only woman I've
really seen him with

09:45.140 --> 09:47.520
is his ex-wife.
Oh, yeah,
but he hates her.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.310
Don't seem like it.

09:49.310 --> 09:51.940
What do you mean by that?

09:51.940 --> 09:54.810
They seem friendly.
How friendly?

09:54.810 --> 09:58.400
I don't know.
He's nice to her.
How nice?!

09:58.400 --> 10:00.740
Do you mind?
I'm trying to watch this.

10:00.740 --> 10:02.320
Now look at this little guy...

10:09.370 --> 10:11.290
(meow)

10:11.290 --> 10:12.620
Son of a bitch!

10:12.620 --> 10:14.080
Here! Edgar! Or Allan.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.590
Whichever the hell one you are.

10:15.590 --> 10:17.130
They ever leave
the store together?

10:17.130 --> 10:19.380
Can I please
just go to bed?

10:19.380 --> 10:21.380
Just answer the damn question.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.720
I feel like I'm gonna
get fired for this.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.050
Georgie, don't worry.

10:25.050 --> 10:27.890
Anything you say
is gonna stay right here.

10:27.890 --> 10:29.430
But you lie all the time.

10:29.430 --> 10:31.180
I learned to lie from you.

10:31.180 --> 10:33.190
See what a special bond we have?

10:33.190 --> 10:35.230
Now answer the damn question!

10:36.810 --> 10:38.360
(sighs)

10:38.360 --> 10:39.610
(wallet thuds)

10:39.610 --> 10:42.200
Why were you gone for so long?

10:42.200 --> 10:43.950
(whispers):
I don't want to talk about it.

10:55.140 --> 10:57.310
Whoa.
What's that?

10:57.310 --> 10:59.730
It's a ghost detector
that came in my cereal box.

11:02.230 --> 11:03.980
It's just a piece of paper.

11:03.980 --> 11:06.070
Then why did it move
in my hand?

11:06.070 --> 11:07.400
From perspiration.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.650
Or ghosts.

11:08.650 --> 11:10.450
(sighs)

11:10.450 --> 11:11.700
Mornin'.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.080
Did you check on Ms. Hutchins?

11:13.080 --> 11:14.410
Is she still alive?

11:14.410 --> 11:16.500
Of course
she is. Why?

11:16.500 --> 11:18.410
No reason.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.210
I'm gonna go eat my breakfast
with her.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.000
Sheldon, just let her rest.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.750
It's okay.
She enjoys my company.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.920
Also, she understands what I'm
going through with Dr. Sturgis.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.220
Excuse me.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.880
I am just trying
to help you grow up

11:29.880 --> 11:31.840
to be a functional adult.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.720
Me? This one's looking
for cereal ghosts.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.350
Looking for and found 'em.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.980
I don't care. You are
not ready for college.

11:38.980 --> 11:41.600
If it were up to you,
I'd still be in grade school.

11:43.020 --> 11:46.690
If you think this is
mature behavior, it isn't!

11:46.690 --> 11:49.610
(exhales)

11:49.610 --> 11:52.740
Being a mom's hard,
isn't it?

11:52.740 --> 11:54.740
Sometimes.

11:55.990 --> 11:57.540
If you ever want
to talk about it,

11:57.540 --> 11:58.790
I'm here for you.

11:58.790 --> 12:00.120
Ooh, it's moving again.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.540
You're so lucky.

12:03.540 --> 12:06.710
You're gonna have to
walk me through that.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.460
Well, you don't have anyone
in your house telling you

12:08.460 --> 12:10.300
what you can or can't do.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.550
Right, Sheldon.

12:11.550 --> 12:13.340
I don't have anyone.

12:13.340 --> 12:14.590
I just said that.

12:14.590 --> 12:16.810
Are you becoming
a drug addict already?

12:16.810 --> 12:18.310
Mornin'.
(chuckles)

12:18.310 --> 12:21.520
Got you some Shipley's
Do-Nuts and coffee.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.400
What happened
to your face?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.730
Oh. Uh...

12:24.730 --> 12:26.770
either Edgar or Allan.
(chuckles)

12:26.770 --> 12:28.110
Oh, that was Edgar.

12:28.110 --> 12:30.280
He can be a rascal.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.580
Good mornin'.
Mornin'.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.370
Did you sleep good?

12:39.370 --> 12:40.750
Yeah.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.460
Want some pancakes?

12:42.460 --> 12:43.790
Sure.

12:43.790 --> 12:45.580
Just one more question
about Dale.

12:45.580 --> 12:46.840
Bye.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.180
There we go.

12:55.180 --> 12:56.930
Nice little bite-size pieces.

12:56.930 --> 12:58.180
HUTCHINS:
Thanks, George,

12:58.180 --> 12:59.810
but I-I think I can manage.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.390
No, no. My pleasure.

13:01.390 --> 13:03.980
He feels so guilty, he'll
do anything you ask him.

13:03.980 --> 13:05.730
That's enough from you.
He bought me

13:05.730 --> 13:07.980
an Easy-Bake Oven when he
closed the car door on my thumb.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.650
Unlike my mother,
who feels no guilt

13:09.650 --> 13:11.690
after hurting her children.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.070
How dare you.

13:13.070 --> 13:14.650
I am trying
to keep you safe

13:14.650 --> 13:16.740
until such a time
as you can make adult decisions.

13:16.740 --> 13:17.990
I can make them now.

13:17.990 --> 13:19.410
Hey, hey. We
have a guest.

13:19.410 --> 13:20.950
Let's pretend like
we like each other.

13:20.950 --> 13:22.200
(chuckles)

13:22.200 --> 13:23.870
Mare, do your grace thing.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.750
♪ I love the melody... ♪

13:26.750 --> 13:28.250
You okay with Mexican?

13:28.250 --> 13:29.500
Oh, yeah.
Terrific.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.090
All right.

13:31.090 --> 13:33.170
Now, I got Tums in the glovebox
for the ride home.

13:33.170 --> 13:35.470
Great.
(chuckles)
(chuckles softly)

13:35.470 --> 13:37.930
So, you talk
to June lately?

13:37.930 --> 13:41.180
Uh, not in a couple
of days. Why?

13:41.180 --> 13:42.770
Oh, no reason.

13:42.770 --> 13:44.430
I was just kind of thinking
about calling her myself.

13:44.430 --> 13:46.350
I mean,
if you're okay with that.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.860
You want to call my ex-wife,
go ahead.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.320
Call her.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.440
Well, I wouldn't want you
to feel uncomfortable.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.690
Yeah, you would.

13:53.690 --> 13:54.950
Yeah, I would.
(chuckles)

13:54.950 --> 13:56.740
I think it's nice

13:56.740 --> 13:58.410
that y'all get along
as well as you do.

13:58.410 --> 13:59.950
Mm-hmm.

13:59.950 --> 14:01.620
Where are we
going with this?

14:01.620 --> 14:03.830
Oh, just nothing.
Makin' conversation.

14:03.830 --> 14:05.330
Okay.

14:05.330 --> 14:06.580
You sleeping with her?

14:06.580 --> 14:07.960
Lord, no.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.960
She's my ex-wife. Come on.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.380
Oh, my gosh, what kind of sicko
sleeps with their ex-wife?

14:14.380 --> 14:15.720
Where is this
coming from?

14:15.720 --> 14:17.260
Are you jealous?

14:17.260 --> 14:18.930
No.

14:18.930 --> 14:20.850
I'd just like to know, you know,

14:20.850 --> 14:22.390
what kind of relationship
we're in.

14:22.390 --> 14:25.600
I mean, are we seeing
other people or what?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.600
Connie Tucker,

14:27.600 --> 14:30.310
are you asking me
to go steady?

14:30.310 --> 14:32.770
You know what I'm asking,
jackass.
(chuckles)

14:32.770 --> 14:34.190
All right, all right, all right.

14:34.190 --> 14:36.360
You listen to me.
Now, I'm 72 years old.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.990
Do you think I have
enough stamina

14:37.990 --> 14:40.490
to go playing around
with other women?

14:40.490 --> 14:42.280
You saying the only reason
you're seeing me

14:42.280 --> 14:44.200
is you're too old and tired
to see anybody else?
(sighs)

14:44.200 --> 14:46.370
(groans softly)
Give me the Tums.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.720
I could kiss you forever.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.590
Uh, that's kind of a long time.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.220
You got somewhere else to be?

15:01.220 --> 15:03.050
No. It's just that,

15:03.050 --> 15:05.020
eventually,
we're gonna get hungry.

15:05.020 --> 15:08.230
Why do I keep getting the
feeling you're not into this?

15:08.230 --> 15:10.770
Oh, I am into this.

15:10.770 --> 15:12.560
But?

15:12.560 --> 15:14.440
(exhales)

15:14.440 --> 15:18.030
I mean, we're real young, and
who knows what's gonna happen?

15:18.030 --> 15:20.110
I know. And you should, too.

15:20.110 --> 15:21.740
Don't feel bad.

15:21.740 --> 15:23.660
I don't know lots of stuff.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.910
So, as long
as we're on the subject,

15:25.910 --> 15:27.540
are you seeing anybody else?

15:27.540 --> 15:29.790
No.

15:29.790 --> 15:31.920
How about that
nutty professor?

15:31.920 --> 15:33.340
We're just friends.

15:33.340 --> 15:35.670
Yeah, well, that's
what June and I are--

15:35.670 --> 15:37.460
just friends.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.930
So what are we?

15:42.930 --> 15:44.180
I don't know.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.560
What do you want to call it?

15:47.180 --> 15:50.190
I guess, a...

15:50.190 --> 15:53.190
committed relationship.

15:53.190 --> 15:55.650
Mm. Works for me.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.730
Okay.
Hmm.

15:57.730 --> 15:59.740
It's settled.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.830
Connie.

16:06.830 --> 16:09.500
This relationship
is suffocating me.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.170
(chuckles)

16:13.290 --> 16:14.750
What'd I say?

16:14.750 --> 16:16.130
I'm not enough for you.
(cries)

16:16.130 --> 16:17.750
I didn't say that.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.760
Just be honest.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.840
You want to date other girls.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.590
I don't want to date
other girls instead of you,

16:23.590 --> 16:26.890
just... in addition to you.

16:26.890 --> 16:29.310
Drop dead.

16:31.230 --> 16:33.230
(starts engine)

16:38.400 --> 16:41.280
Okay, but I'm gonna follow you
and make sure you get home safe!

16:41.280 --> 16:43.240
Do whatever you want.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.820
If you walk to Dairy Queen,
I'll buy you a Blizzard.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.540
Want me to turn
on some music?

16:49.540 --> 16:52.910
(rock music playing)

16:56.750 --> 16:59.460
Well, this is
just delicious, Mary.

16:59.460 --> 17:00.710
Thank you.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.340
Bite-sized enough for you?

17:03.340 --> 17:05.050
Oh. Perfect.
(chuckles)

17:06.430 --> 17:07.680
(sighs)

17:07.680 --> 17:09.180
How long do I
have to sit here

17:09.180 --> 17:11.470
and sulk before someone
asks me what's wrong?

17:11.470 --> 17:13.890
Maybe people are tired
of hearing about it.

17:13.890 --> 17:15.900
Ms. Hutchins, would
you care to chime in?

17:15.900 --> 17:18.400
Oh, I-I don't want
to get in the middle

17:18.400 --> 17:20.190
of a family
issue, but...

17:20.190 --> 17:22.240
I will say that I once had
a falling out

17:22.240 --> 17:24.150
with someone very close to me.

17:24.150 --> 17:25.410
What happened?

17:25.410 --> 17:28.240
We ended up parting ways
on bad terms.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.240
I-I still regret it.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.080
But you were right
and they were wrong?

17:33.080 --> 17:34.370
You know what,

17:34.370 --> 17:36.120
it doesn't feel
like it matters anymore.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.960
And not a day goes by
that I don't miss them.

17:41.500 --> 17:45.010
Perhaps I do owe
Dr. Sturgis an apology.

17:45.010 --> 17:47.340
I was talking about your mother.

17:47.340 --> 17:49.390
I'll circle back to her.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.430
Thank you.

17:53.430 --> 17:55.270
I can't believe
you got through to him.

17:55.270 --> 17:56.770
Happy to help.

17:56.770 --> 17:59.150
So, who was the person
you had the fight with?

17:59.150 --> 18:00.610
It was my cat, Poe.

18:00.610 --> 18:03.610
She ran away when I switched
to dry food.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.280
It was cheaper.

18:11.410 --> 18:13.410
Good night, baby.
Night, Mama.

18:14.910 --> 18:17.170
I'm really sorry, Mom.

18:17.170 --> 18:19.630
(exhales)
I forgive you.

18:19.630 --> 18:21.840
But just because
you straightened things out

18:21.840 --> 18:24.760
with Dr. Sturgis doesn't mean
you're going back to college.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.470
Yes, it does.
No, it doesn't.

18:26.470 --> 18:29.390
I hope you know you're
jeopardizing our relationship.

18:29.390 --> 18:31.680
I will take that risk.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.180
(kiss)
Good night.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.520
You know
I'll eventually wear you down.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.310
We'll see.

18:38.310 --> 18:40.310
I'm pretty tough.

18:42.110 --> 18:44.610
ADULT SHELDON:
I eventually wore her down.

18:44.610 --> 18:46.950
There's just so much of me
anybody can take.

18:51.940 --> 18:54.530
NEWSCASTER: In local news,
Friday night's football game

18:54.530 --> 18:57.200
was marred by a brutal injury,

18:57.200 --> 18:59.870
when football coach
George Cooper saved himself

18:59.870 --> 19:03.950
at the expense of beloved school
librarian Cheryl Hutchins.

19:03.950 --> 19:05.660
Oh, no.

19:05.660 --> 19:09.370
We warn you, the following
footage is hard to watch.

19:09.370 --> 19:10.830
Well, then, don't show it.

19:10.830 --> 19:12.840
(grunting)

19:12.840 --> 19:15.050
(whistle blows)

19:15.050 --> 19:17.470
Let's see it again
in slow motion.

19:17.470 --> 19:18.840
GEORGE SR.:
This is not news.
