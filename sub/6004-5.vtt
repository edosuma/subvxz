WEBVTT

00:10.443 --> 00:12.144
Planet looks harmless enough.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.646
So did the last place
The Collector sent us.

00:14.647 --> 00:17.282
Until it wasn't.
- I am Groot.

00:17.283 --> 00:18.984
We are being followed.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.587
Lose 'em?
- Nah. Let's get a look at 'em first.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.893
These so-called "Guardians" are
gonna mess up sooner or later.

00:27.894 --> 00:31.630
And when they do, I'm gonna
throw them all in Kyln prison.

00:31.631 --> 00:33.098
Wait... Where'd they go?

00:37.637 --> 00:38.570
Are they nuts?

00:43.376 --> 00:44.943
How's it goin'?

00:48.148 --> 00:50.416
You lowlifes won't get away with this.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.654
You really want to provoke
that space-cop again, Quill?

00:55.655 --> 00:57.723
The real question is,
how did Titus follow us

00:57.724 --> 01:00.025
all the way from Conjunction?

01:00.026 --> 01:02.594
Might have had something
to do with this tracker.

01:02.595 --> 01:04.396
Oops.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.832
All right, we're looking
for one large Pandorian crystal.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.734
It should stick out like a sore thumb

01:08.735 --> 01:10.769
in all this leafy green stuff.

01:14.374 --> 01:15.607
So what do you think, big guy?

01:15.608 --> 01:17.342
See any long-lost relatives?

01:17.343 --> 01:19.445
Some missing branches from the family tree?

01:19.913 --> 01:22.081
I am Groot.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.384
Hey. Lay off of Groot.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.386
Oh, come on. I'm just kiddin' around.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.588
He doesn't understand
half of what I say anyway.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.858
No one understands most of what
you say, but that ain't the point!

01:32.859 --> 01:34.460
He's... Sensitive.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.762
Look, he's a log!

01:36.763 --> 01:38.597
We should get moving.
- Right.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.233
Let's go find us a crystal.
- I am Groot!

01:41.234 --> 01:44.470
It's all right, buddy. You can hang out
here and watch the Milano instead.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.038
See? You hurt his feelings!

01:51.377 --> 01:54.346
The Collector said the crystal
should be somewhere in this village.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.987
Yeah, great!

02:01.988 --> 02:04.790
A whole town full of tree-killers.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.092
Good thing Groot ain't here to see this.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.627
Crystal, dead ahead.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.229
Even better!

02:10.229 --> 02:12.831
They worship the d'ast crystal.

02:12.832 --> 02:15.033
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

02:19.772 --> 02:23.242
Okay. These disguises are just offensive.

02:23.243 --> 02:26.778
You! What are you doing back there?

02:29.015 --> 02:30.649
Great plan, Quill...

02:30.650 --> 02:32.816
And by "great", I mean lousy.

02:38.630 --> 02:43.630
<font color=#F2F2F2>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</font><font color=#00bbb9>SO1EO5</font>
<font color=#FF0>Original air date</fo</font>

02:46.666 --> 02:49.835
Well? What are you doing there?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.336
I was just, uh...

02:51.337 --> 02:53.138
Fixing your sacred crystal here.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.107
What sort of blade is that?

02:55.108 --> 02:57.643
This? It's a laser scalpel.

02:57.644 --> 03:01.813
Well, it might prove
useful against the monsters.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.649
What do you want for it?

03:03.650 --> 03:06.618
Oh! Oh... I couldn't part with this.

03:06.619 --> 03:10.055
Uh, my dear father killed
six forest monsters with it.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.957
It's probably worth...

03:11.958 --> 03:13.892
I mean, as much as this crystal.

03:13.893 --> 03:15.794
Agreed! The crystal...

03:15.795 --> 03:17.362
For the blade.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.731
You drive a hard bargain, mister.

03:23.369 --> 03:27.839
Ha! I can't believe that chump traded
the crystal for a crummy pocket knife.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.510
I can't believe that
fool gave me this amazing blade

03:31.511 --> 03:33.345
for that worthless hunk of rock!

03:35.815 --> 03:37.849
I am Groot. I am Groot!

03:37.850 --> 03:40.252
Huh?

03:40.253 --> 03:41.987
I am Groot. I am Groot!

03:41.988 --> 03:43.889
It's okay! It's okay, he's with us.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.924
No monsters here, I promise.

03:45.925 --> 03:46.792
Huh?

03:50.863 --> 03:52.431
I stand corrected.

03:58.504 --> 03:59.805
Back, foul creatures.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.307
Go. Now!

04:10.950 --> 04:12.918
I am Groot. Yeah!

04:12.919 --> 04:14.686
That was awesome, huh?

04:14.687 --> 04:15.921
I am Groot!

04:18.558 --> 04:20.225
You could've warned me!

04:20.226 --> 04:23.495
I am Groot!

04:28.368 --> 04:30.802
Leave our village, foul beasts!

04:30.803 --> 04:32.271
You get out of here!

04:38.278 --> 04:40.212
Let us celebrate our victory

04:40.213 --> 04:41.913
and our heroic friends

04:41.914 --> 04:45.117
with a feast!

04:45.118 --> 04:47.319
I am Groot!

04:49.000 --> 04:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:06.172 --> 05:08.974
Yes! Right down the middle in one blow.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.842
Take that, Mr. Log!

05:12.011 --> 05:14.112
I am Groot.

05:14.113 --> 05:16.415
Hey! Show a little sensitivity, huh?

05:16.416 --> 05:18.950
Lighten up. It's a party!

05:18.951 --> 05:20.319
For the heroic...

05:20.320 --> 05:22.321
Guardians of the Galaxy!

05:27.994 --> 05:29.795
I am Groot?

05:29.796 --> 05:31.763
I think you better hold onto it, buddy.

05:31.764 --> 05:32.931
You're the responsible one.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.004
So those stone creatures.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.672
Have they attacked you before?

05:40.673 --> 05:41.873
Mmm.

05:41.874 --> 05:44.042
The Rexians first appeared after a fireball

05:44.043 --> 05:46.645
flew across the sky,
streaking off to the west.

05:46.646 --> 05:50.115
A few days later, we noticed the
fungus spreading through the forest.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.017
And then, those creatures.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.386
Try and have some fun, huh?

05:54.387 --> 05:56.788
Hey, I promise, nobody's
gonna chop you down.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.790
They'd have to get through me first.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.796
I am Groot. I am Groot!

06:04.797 --> 06:07.799
I am Groot, I am Groot, I am Groot!

06:07.800 --> 06:10.068
I am Groot! I am Groot!

06:14.474 --> 06:18.009
You'd think a walking tree would be a
little more careful about forest fires.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.878
I am Groot.

06:22.248 --> 06:23.815
What?

06:23.816 --> 06:25.050
Ow!

06:28.354 --> 06:30.055
They no longer appear grateful.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.691
Nearly getting your
whole town burned down?

06:32.692 --> 06:35.060
It's kind of a mood-killer.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.095
Yeah, I think we'll be going now.

06:37.096 --> 06:40.065
We can't leave them vulnerable
to another rock monster attack.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.900
Agreed.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.269
I have become quite fond
of the little wood-choppers.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.271
Besides, we ain't goin' nowhere...

06:46.272 --> 06:48.774
Till you apologize to Groot!

06:48.775 --> 06:51.777
He tries to torch the whole
village, and I got to apologize?

06:52.779 --> 06:53.912
Mmm-hmm.

06:55.114 --> 06:56.748
Fine.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.889
Groot, why'd you leave!

07:03.890 --> 07:06.291
Get it? 'Cause you're a tree!

07:13.132 --> 07:15.100
Dude, is that mold?

07:15.101 --> 07:16.635
Ugh! Gross.

07:23.242 --> 07:26.111
Groot! Come on, man. Lighten up!

07:31.884 --> 07:34.453
Yo, Groot! That you?

07:38.591 --> 07:42.561
Hey. Uh, apparently I said something
that you took the wrong way,

07:42.562 --> 07:45.163
and... Can you at least look at me?

07:45.164 --> 07:47.999
I'm trying to be sincere here.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.968
Okay, fine. If you're gonna be that way,

07:49.969 --> 07:51.136
I won't look at you, either.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.738
How's that?

07:53.739 --> 07:56.141
I mean, I bust on your little
buddy Rocket all the time,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.076
and you don't see him getting all weepy.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.088
Come on, man. If that's
all you're gonna say...

08:10.089 --> 08:11.156
Whoa!

08:11.157 --> 08:15.160
I am Groot!

08:22.935 --> 08:25.003
Guys? We have a problem!

08:26.205 --> 08:32.210
I am Groot!

08:32.211 --> 08:34.513
Quill? What did you do?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.648
Me?
- It's the fungus!

08:36.649 --> 08:39.650
It's taken him over, just
like the rock creatures!

08:48.995 --> 08:52.130
Oh, you've got to be kidding!

09:04.410 --> 09:08.046
He's growing out of control.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.515
How can we stop Groot without hurting him?

09:16.022 --> 09:18.857
Groot.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.726
Groot! You gotta cut it
out! You're acting crazy!

09:21.727 --> 09:25.430
I am Groot.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.868
Ugh! He's just talking gibberish!

09:29.869 --> 09:31.670
Oh, when I say that, it's an insult?

09:31.671 --> 09:33.872
Seriously! Even I can't understand him.

09:35.541 --> 09:38.443
Well, this worked pretty
well on the rock dudes.

09:42.348 --> 09:45.050
Timber!

09:45.051 --> 09:48.420
I am Groot.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.358
I don't think that's gonna
keep the big guy down long.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.595
If fungus controls him,

09:56.596 --> 09:58.630
we must remove the fungus.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.701
Okay, problem.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.736
The fungus is all up inside him, too.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.638
And... So is the crystal?

10:08.207 --> 10:10.642
Don't bother. I gave it
to him for safekeeping.

10:10.643 --> 10:14.279
We need to stop Groot's infection
from the inside of the root.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.114
If you'll... Pardon the expression.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.149
All right. Me and Rocket
will go in and figure out

10:18.150 --> 10:19.651
how to deal with the fungus.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.286
You guys stay out here
and protect the villagers

10:21.287 --> 10:23.121
if the beanstalk here wakes up.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.255
Huh?

10:24.256 --> 10:26.157
As in, Jack and the Beanstalk?

10:26.158 --> 10:27.492
Famous earth legend?

10:27.493 --> 10:29.294
Okay. See, there's
these magic beans, and...

10:29.295 --> 10:30.962
You know what? Never mind.

10:30.963 --> 10:34.933
Come on! I saw a big
knothole down by his leg!

10:34.934 --> 10:37.135
Never thought
I'd have to play tree surgeon.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.803
Really, Quill? You're goin' there?

10:38.804 --> 10:41.172
Yeah, that's not creepy at all.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.975
Poor guy. That's gotta hurt.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.677
Wow! He's empty inside.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.312
Oh, there you go again!

10:47.313 --> 10:50.281
It so happens that Groot
has a rich inner life!

10:50.282 --> 10:51.816
He's a deep thinker, man.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.452
No, I mean he's literally "hollow."

10:54.453 --> 10:56.788
Yeah, he... Oh, yeah.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.923
I guess he is. Weird.

10:58.924 --> 11:01.760
Don't look now, but here
comes the welcoming committee.

11:01.761 --> 11:04.329
They do
not look very welcoming.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.132
Destroy the monster!
- Hold on!

11:07.133 --> 11:08.466
I don't know what you're planning,

11:08.467 --> 11:11.269
but that "monster" is our friend.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.305
And our other friends
are inside that friend.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.307
I'm very sorry, but the only thing

11:16.308 --> 11:19.377
that has kept this infection
from spreading is fire!

11:19.378 --> 11:22.013
We must burn every trace
of the fungus we find.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.282
Burn the monster!

11:24.283 --> 11:26.551
Ugh. This stuff is everywhere.

11:26.552 --> 11:29.187
It's like a neon noodle factory

11:29.188 --> 11:30.622
threw up on everything.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.691
No wonder he's going nutso.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.360
Don't worry, buddy. We'll get
this gunk out of your system.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.562
Somehow.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.998
Maybe we can burn the fungus
without hurting Groot too badly.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.834
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You see
that sticky stuff on the walls?

11:42.835 --> 11:45.503
One little spark, and
that sap goes "Whoosh!"

11:45.504 --> 11:48.139
So no flamethrowers, no element blaster,

11:48.140 --> 11:50.875
and don't even think about
using those jet boots.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.314
We must not hurt them...

11:56.315 --> 11:57.615
Badly.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.069
Fire in the knothole!

12:18.070 --> 12:19.571
That ain't funny!

12:21.340 --> 12:25.176
I am Groot.

12:31.117 --> 12:32.484
There are too many.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.820
Grab on!

12:43.195 --> 12:44.729
Okay, either I'm tree-sick,

12:44.730 --> 12:46.898
or your big, wooden buddy is tilting.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.466
That hot-foot must have woke him up!

12:52.204 --> 12:54.906
Oh, come on!

12:54.907 --> 12:56.274
I'm supposed to light the firewood,

12:56.275 --> 12:57.976
not the other way around!

12:59.044 --> 13:01.045
Still not funny, Quill!

13:02.281 --> 13:04.616
Groot! I hate roasted vegetables!

13:04.617 --> 13:06.484
Not even close to funny!

13:23.402 --> 13:25.770
Oh, flarg.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.140
I got ya, little buddy!

13:35.447 --> 13:37.348
We get out of here alive,

13:37.349 --> 13:40.185
we don't tell nobody
about this, okay?

13:40.186 --> 13:41.853
Come on. Let's get up to the top

13:41.854 --> 13:43.688
before he decides to breakdance.

13:43.689 --> 13:46.191
Yeah. No idea what that means!

13:46.192 --> 13:48.159
And you say Groot don't make no sense.

13:48.761 --> 13:53.064
I am Groot.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.303
Keep Groot busy.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.371
He can't attack the
village if he's after us.

14:00.372 --> 14:02.507
I shall do my best to occupy his attention.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.723
I am Groot!

14:36.342 --> 14:38.009
Drax, look!

14:38.010 --> 14:40.545
That meteor must be the
source of the fungus.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.413
Then I will destroy it at once!

14:46.485 --> 14:48.253
Titus to Nova Headquarters.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.622
I'm attempting to neutralize
the mutative menace.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.729
This day just gets better and better!

14:57.730 --> 15:01.132
I do not see how a Nova Corps
attack improves our situation.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.671
I am Groot.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.441
What the krutack is that?

15:10.442 --> 15:12.610
I don't know. His heart?

15:12.611 --> 15:14.679
Plants don't have hearts!

15:14.680 --> 15:17.582
Except hearts of palm. And celery hearts.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.417
You finished?
- Think so.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.420
No, wait, artichoke hearts!

15:22.421 --> 15:24.389
Now, I am finished.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.225
Whatever it is, the fungus
withers when it gets close to it.

15:27.226 --> 15:28.626
Maybe that's how we beat this thing!

15:32.564 --> 15:34.799
Pandorian crystal at 12 o'clock.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.101
Hello, beautiful.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.204
Jeez, Quill. Can't you
focus on Groot for once?

15:40.205 --> 15:42.473
I am! I'm all about saving Groot!

15:42.474 --> 15:44.742
But while we figure out how to do that...

15:44.743 --> 15:46.811
I'm gonna grab this crystal!

15:46.812 --> 15:49.147
Fine, fine. Grab the lousy...

15:49.148 --> 15:50.548
'Kay. ROCKET: Huh?

15:50.549 --> 15:51.883
Uh, Quill?

15:51.884 --> 15:53.685
Something weird over here.

15:57.556 --> 15:58.957
Hang on...

15:58.958 --> 16:00.725
Almost got it...

16:01.994 --> 16:03.261
Quill! Behind you!

16:14.106 --> 16:15.506
Quill!

16:21.847 --> 16:23.681
Hey! Little help here?

16:24.516 --> 16:25.583
Quill?

16:27.619 --> 16:30.588
I am Groot!

16:31.190 --> 16:32.790
Titus here.

16:32.791 --> 16:35.593
Conventional weapons proving
ineffective against current threat.

16:35.594 --> 16:38.696
Requesting clearance to
use anti-matter ordnance.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.465
Request
denied, corpsman!

16:40.466 --> 16:43.201
The resulting explosion would likely
destroy the village and its...

16:44.703 --> 16:46.537
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.511
Anti-matter missiles!

16:53.512 --> 16:55.947
Is he insane? He'll kill us all!

16:58.650 --> 17:00.618
No. He will not.

17:27.913 --> 17:30.048
One down, four to go.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.918
Snap out of it!

17:36.655 --> 17:38.856
Come on! Say something, Quill!

17:38.857 --> 17:40.658
A stupid tree joke. Anything!

17:59.511 --> 18:01.179
I am Groot!

18:04.716 --> 18:06.984
Quill? What are
you watering that thing for?

18:13.625 --> 18:17.795
I am Groot!

18:19.698 --> 18:21.065
I don't know what you did, Quill,

18:21.066 --> 18:22.600
but you're killing off the fungus!

18:24.036 --> 18:25.903
I am Groot!

18:25.904 --> 18:28.339
Groot. Are you all right?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.478
Lock target and fire.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.811
I told you I
would destroy the fungus.

19:09.248 --> 19:11.949
Is it just me, or is it
getting cramped in here?

19:11.950 --> 19:13.651
I am Groot!

19:13.652 --> 19:15.186
That's offensive!

19:15.187 --> 19:17.655
But it don't get funnier with repetition!

19:22.794 --> 19:24.729
Huh?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.002
So, what happened?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.204
How did you get rid of the fungus?

19:33.205 --> 19:35.173
I am Groot.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.642
Seriously, knock it off!

19:37.643 --> 19:38.843
I am Groot! I...

19:38.844 --> 19:40.611
I am Groot!

19:40.612 --> 19:42.780
I am Groot, I am Groot.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.815
Your friend.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.384
And that explosion?

19:46.385 --> 19:49.053
The meteor that brought the
fungus has been destroyed.

19:49.054 --> 19:52.723
And without the fungus to
infect them, no more monsters.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.560
Attention!
You're under arrest for interfering

19:55.561 --> 19:58.296
with a Nova Corps officer
in the course of his duties.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.864
Now, stand clear,

19:59.865 --> 20:02.867
so I can blast that monster.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.537
The Guardians of the Galaxy
are heroes, not criminals.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.905
If you would do them harm,

20:07.906 --> 20:09.907
you'll have to go through us first.

20:09.908 --> 20:11.642
And I don't imagine Nova Corps

20:11.643 --> 20:15.179
takes kindly to one of their
own slaughtering innocents.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.882
Fine.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.184
But I still got my eye on you...

20:20.185 --> 20:22.320
Guardians.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.960
Listen, Quill, I'm sorry you
had to leave your crystal.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.128
I am Groot.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.167
I am Groot!

20:45.077 --> 20:47.945
Oh, another point on
the map to... Something.

20:47.946 --> 20:50.848
The Cosmic Seed? My dad?

20:50.849 --> 20:53.851
I am Groot.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.621
Yeah, I get it.

20:56.622 --> 21:00.925
Carrying around the thing that can grow
back your entire civilization inside you?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.860
You're a lot more than just a log.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.396
There you guys are!
Hey, listen... I gotta know.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.798
What happened when you touched
the big, glowy thing, huh?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.869
I am Groot!

21:11.870 --> 21:14.405
Ah! I know you can talk again.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.474
I heard you sing into your stupid tape!

21:16.475 --> 21:18.075
It's kind of a blur.

21:18.076 --> 21:20.778
I mean, I still can't understand
what Groot says, but...

21:20.779 --> 21:22.580
I think I know what he means.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.882
Oh, you think! Well...

21:24.883 --> 21:27.418
I know exactly what he means.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.820
Is that right, bud?

21:29.821 --> 21:31.155
I am Groot.

21:31.156 --> 21:34.225
That's okay, big guy.
I'll keep your secret.
