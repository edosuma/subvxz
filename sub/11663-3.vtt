(ringing)

01:08.800 --> 01:11.033
(ringing)

01:11.967 --> 01:13.200
You rang?

01:14.367 --> 01:15.700
I want a cracker.

01:29.133 --> 01:32.033
And something to drink
with a twist of lemon.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.867
-What is it now?
-Habit.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.066
Give me that.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.433
Listen, Ma, I've made a decision.

01:55.900 --> 01:59.467
We'll have to get a nurse
to take care of you until you're well.

01:59.533 --> 02:01.033
Why can't you take care of me?

02:01.100 --> 02:05.433
I have that education conference
starting Tuesday,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.834
Blanche is busy with her granddaughter,
and Rose is...

02:09.967 --> 02:12.200
well, I think a nurse is the way to go.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.700
I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

02:15.767 --> 02:19.967
Then why have you been running me ragged
doing things for you?

02:20.033 --> 02:21.834
Honestly? It tickles me.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.266
Look, Ma, I'm hiring a nurse.

02:25.333 --> 02:28.367
At your age, we can't take
any injury for granted.

02:28.433 --> 02:30.567
It's your fault I sprained both my ankles.

02:30.633 --> 02:34.166
You were the one who sneezed
and blew yourself off the stool.

02:35.133 --> 02:37.934
You should have let me sit at the table.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.734
Ma, you know the rules.

02:40.033 --> 02:43.367
When we eat Mexican food,
you sit at the counter.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.967
Now, it's settled.
I'll have a nurse here tomorrow.

02:50.033 --> 02:52.834
Wouldn't it be cheaper to just
set me adrift on an ice flow?

02:53.600 --> 02:56.066
If it were,
do you think you'd still be here?

02:58.266 --> 03:02.066
-Oh, hi, we're back.
-Hi, honey. What did you do today?

03:02.133 --> 03:05.200
Grandma took me to the docks
to watch the sailors come in.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.233
I remember spending that quality wharf
time with my grandma.

03:13.100 --> 03:17.100
Grandma gave me a nickname
to call her in front of the Navy.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.166
-What was that?
-Sis.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.800
Sis?

03:22.867 --> 03:25.000
She calls her other
grandmother grandma.

03:25.066 --> 03:28.133
This cuts down on the confusion.
Run along, darling. Run along.

03:29.767 --> 03:32.300
I'm just so worried.
You've got to help me.

03:32.367 --> 03:35.967
-I'm so concerned about Melissa.
-What's wrong?

03:36.033 --> 03:39.300
I had a lot more fun this afternoon
than she did.

03:39.367 --> 03:42.633
I promised Janet her little girl
would have fun.

03:42.967 --> 03:45.800
I have no idea how to keep her
entertained.

03:45.867 --> 03:48.734
The important thing is to spend time
with her.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.367
Do something you both enjoy.

03:51.433 --> 03:56.633
Why don't you take her to the movies,
to the beach, to the petting zoo?

03:56.700 --> 03:58.000
The petting zoo?

03:59.066 --> 04:01.500
Dorothy, even I don't go
to that club anymore.

04:03.567 --> 04:07.400
(serene music playing)

04:07.467 --> 04:09.533
Girls, I've got big news.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.000
I found something Melissa and I
can do together.

04:12.066 --> 04:14.967
I have entered her in the little miss
Miami pageant...

04:15.233 --> 04:17.767
and we're a cinch to win, aren't we?

04:17.834 --> 04:19.100
Hit it, sweetheart.

04:19.767 --> 04:22.767
Hi. My name's Melissa,
and I'm 5 years old.

04:24.433 --> 04:29.266
-Blanche, she's 7.
-That works out to be 5 in Blanche years.

04:31.633 --> 04:36.166
Look at this face, girls.
How could a child this gorgeous lose?

04:36.233 --> 04:39.533
-I think it's a great idea.
-Oh, sure, it is...

04:39.934 --> 04:42.600
if you like the notion of children
competing

04:42.667 --> 04:47.333
in a bloodthirsty winner-take-all contest,
where what's on the outside

04:47.400 --> 04:50.133
is considered more important
than what's on the inside.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.033
Lost the little miss St. Olaf pageant,
did you?

04:57.400 --> 04:59.500
23 years in a row.

05:03.166 --> 05:07.133
Once they picked Eileen Ditmeyer's
imaginary playmate over me.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.800
Sure, she was more talented, but...

05:13.400 --> 05:15.667
still, I smelled a rat.

05:16.400 --> 05:21.567
-You mean the contest was fixed?
-No, that was my talent. Smelling rats.

05:26.233 --> 05:29.567
Blanche, I'm not sure this is a good idea,
either.

05:29.633 --> 05:34.667
Beauty pageants are archaic and sexist,
not to mention degrading.

05:34.734 --> 05:37.700
Lost the little miss Brooklyn contest,
did you?

05:39.166 --> 05:41.667
I practiced that trombone for weeks.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.867
There was Ma, sitting in the front row
sucking a lemon.

05:49.900 --> 05:53.700
You were just nervous
because your mother was in the front row.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.166
She was a judge.

05:58.133 --> 05:59.233
Well, come along, Melissa.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.533
We have a lot of work to do
if we're going to win.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.533
-We can still go to the circus, right?
-Well, we'll see.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.166
The pageant is just a few days away.

06:08.633 --> 06:11.333
You can go to that circus any old time.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.200
How many years can you enter the little
miss contest?

06:14.266 --> 06:16.266
Evidently 23.

06:20.433 --> 06:22.967
At least my mother voted for me.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.867
(doorbell chimes)

06:32.133 --> 06:34.233
Ah, nurse Defarge, right on time.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.233
Of course I'm on time.
I'm always on time.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.767
You know what happens
when a nurse is late?

06:40.133 --> 06:41.667
People die.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.033
Well, then, let's get the party started.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.767
This is my friend Rose Nylund.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.567
I'll go get ma.

06:52.633 --> 06:55.100
I'm sure she's anxious
to get reacquainted.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.567
Oh, then you've known Sophia before.

06:57.633 --> 07:02.667
Yes. She was one of the residents
at a place I worked called Shady Pines.

07:04.266 --> 07:07.367
To tell the truth,
I don't think she'll remember me.

07:07.800 --> 07:14.300
-Ma, I'm--
-Aah! Aah! Aah!

07:15.867 --> 07:18.233
I hope that doesn't make you
uncomfortable.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.100
-What are you doing?
-I'm rolling for my life.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.066
You hired the angel of death
from Shady Pines.

07:28.133 --> 07:31.200
Ma, don't be ridiculous.
She's not the angel of death.

07:31.266 --> 07:34.333
She's a private nurse
with excellent references.

07:34.400 --> 07:38.834
For the last time,
Shady Pines is a very reputable rest home.

07:38.900 --> 07:39.900
I'm telling you, Dorothy,

07:39.967 --> 07:42.767
they used to presell our bodies
to medical schools.

07:44.834 --> 07:47.567
That was the big joke.
Want to go to college?

07:51.633 --> 07:54.567
-Now, where's my patient?
-Don't you mean victim?

07:54.633 --> 07:55.700
Ma.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.800
Now, look, Sophia,
I know you didn't like it at Shady Pines.

08:00.867 --> 08:03.633
Nobody did after their families
dumped them there.

08:06.100 --> 08:10.600
But I'm sure if you just give me a chance
we'll become fast friends.

08:10.667 --> 08:13.867
Dorothy, I really wish you'd
respect my feelings about this.

08:13.934 --> 08:18.333
Ma, I really wish you had voted for me
in the little miss Brooklyn pageant.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.633
-Hey, I calls 'em as I sees 'em.
-Now, ladies, please.

08:24.700 --> 08:29.567
Sophia, I'm just here to take care of you.
You want your back rubbed, I'm here.

08:29.633 --> 08:35.066
A glass of water, call me.
I'll see to each of your needs.

08:35.133 --> 08:37.800
I have to talk something over
with my daughter.

08:37.867 --> 08:38.934
Of course.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.367
You see, Ma, I--

08:43.700 --> 08:45.800
-You rang?
-You're hired.

08:48.033 --> 08:50.834
(calm music playing)

08:50.900 --> 08:55.967
-(TV plays)

-Hey!
-What are you doing?

09:14.033 --> 09:16.934
We were going to watch <i>The Nun's Story.</i>

09:17.000 --> 09:19.200
She leaves the convent in the end.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.333
There it is. <i>Ironside.</i>

09:25.333 --> 09:27.667
He's the master of the wheelchair.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.800
Just look at the way
he takes those corners.

09:29.867 --> 09:33.567
-Oh, come on, the guy's got radials.
-Excuse me.

09:33.633 --> 09:38.000
-We were watching something else.
-Sophia wants to watch <i>Ironside,</i>

09:38.066 --> 09:41.200
and I believe a happy patient
is a healthy patient.

09:41.867 --> 09:43.867
He's a fine detective, isn't he, Sophia?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.166
Oh, please, call me ma.

09:48.734 --> 09:50.633
-"Ma"?
-Not you.

09:52.233 --> 09:56.633
-Oh. Popcorn, Ma?
-No. It gets caught in my teeth.

09:56.967 --> 09:59.934
I'll tell you what.
I'll floss them while you nap.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.166
You're a good kid.

10:04.600 --> 10:08.500
-You want plain floss or mint-flavored?
-Surprise me.

10:10.767 --> 10:15.166
(calm music playing)

10:15.233 --> 10:17.800
You have got to get rid of her.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.767
She bosses us around,
won't let us have fun.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.867
She's making our lives miserable.

10:22.934 --> 10:26.533
I don't like her, either,
but what can I do?

10:26.600 --> 10:32.066
Ma's ankles haven't healed yet.
And besides, nurse Defarge means well.

10:32.133 --> 10:37.000
Dorothy, at 2am this morning,
I was entertaining a gentleman caller...

10:39.600 --> 10:43.600
when she opened the door
at the most inopportune time.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.233
I could've lost my balance
and chipped a tooth.

10:54.066 --> 10:55.934
You think that's annoying?

10:56.200 --> 10:57.800
She came into my room last night

10:57.867 --> 11:01.867
when I was re-enacting the gangplank scene
from <i>Peter Pan.</i>

11:03.667 --> 11:07.166
What the hell goes on at night
in this house?

11:11.166 --> 11:13.433
I know you are both upset,

11:13.500 --> 11:16.900
but nothing I have heard
is grounds for firing the woman.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.967
Oh, excuse me, ladies.

11:19.367 --> 11:23.533
Oh, by the way, Dorothy, a man called
asking if you were free Saturday.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.400
I forgot to write down the number. Sorry.

11:27.633 --> 11:29.900
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.934
Grandma, is this the one
you said you liked?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.500
Yes. Isn't that just beautiful?

11:45.567 --> 11:49.066
Girls, look, this is one of her outfits
for the pageant.

11:49.133 --> 11:51.900
She's going to win this thing hands down.

11:52.300 --> 11:55.333
-Sweetheart, sing your song for everybody.
-Grandma, I'm tired.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.066
We've been rehearsing all day.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.066
But if we don't rehearse,
we don't win.

12:00.133 --> 12:03.700
Blanche, aren't you getting carried away
with this pageant?

12:03.967 --> 12:05.500
Well, don't be ridiculous.

12:05.867 --> 12:10.400
I wish Janet were here to see how
wonderful her mother and her little girl

12:10.467 --> 12:11.467
are getting along.

12:11.767 --> 12:16.066
She'll let her come back year after year.
I'll go get the music.

12:18.367 --> 12:20.767
Get some sleep tonight

12:20.834 --> 12:23.300
so you'll be rested when we go to
the zoo tomorrow.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.900
I'm not going to the zoo.
Grandma says we have to rehearse tomorrow.

12:27.333 --> 12:30.533
We can't do anything fun
because of the stupid pageant.

12:31.266 --> 12:32.967
I wish I could go home.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.200
Here we go.

12:35.567 --> 12:37.800
But we before we sing
our little hearts out,

12:37.867 --> 12:41.066
how about a hug for the best grandma
in the world?

12:47.433 --> 12:49.333
(serene music playing)

12:49.400 --> 12:55.100
I'm not good at firing people.
I've never been good at confrontations.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.700
How about when you made that cop cry?

13:01.600 --> 13:03.834
Then he wasn't much of a cop, was he?

13:05.900 --> 13:10.133
Maybe I better talk to her.
I'll handle it with a little more tact.

13:11.633 --> 13:16.133
-Ah, good morning, ladies.
-Not for you, nursey, nurse, nurse, nurse.

13:27.233 --> 13:32.266
Uh, what I think Rose is trying to say
is that, uh...

13:33.300 --> 13:36.066
things aren't working out, and, uh...

13:36.567 --> 13:39.800
-we're going to have to let you go.
-You're firing me?

13:39.867 --> 13:42.166
No, no, no, no, no. Yes.

13:44.700 --> 13:48.834
-What's going on?
-I've been fired, Ma.

13:51.767 --> 13:55.533
-What?
-We all think it's for the best.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.667
Well, Mildred, that's it.
What Dorothy says goes.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.266
We'll just have to say...

14:01.066 --> 14:05.800
-Aah! Leg cramp.
-Ohh. There, there.

14:05.867 --> 14:08.133
Ahh. That's better.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.633
Thank God you were here.

14:13.767 --> 14:17.400
-Dorothy, I'm sorry. I cannot leave.
-What?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.934
Until she can walk again, I'm staying put.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.066
You're a good daughter.
Take a lesson, pussycat.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.934
You're pussycat, too?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.734
I am pussycat one. You are pussycat two.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.734
What can I do?
Ma obviously needs her.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.133
My hands are tied.

14:42.967 --> 14:45.367
Sorry about that nursey, nurse,
nurse, nurse thing.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.867
I never thought I'd see you again.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.867
Well, Sophia, I'm going
to have to keep my word.

14:54.266 --> 14:57.000
As soon as you can walk,
I'll have to leave.

14:57.066 --> 14:59.367
Yeah, I know. As soon as I can walk.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.367
But I don't think that's
gonna be for a long, long time.

15:06.066 --> 15:10.400
(mellow music playing)

15:11.834 --> 15:17.033
This competition will be a piece of cake.
Just look around... ugly.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.500
No charisma.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.166
There's a gym teacher waiting to happen.

15:27.400 --> 15:31.967
Oh, Blanche, how can you say that?
All these girls are adorable.

15:32.033 --> 15:33.333
Oh, yeah, sure.

15:33.734 --> 15:36.367
I just wish I had that one's nose
full of nickels.

15:37.834 --> 15:40.467
-She's on in two minutes.
-Two minutes.

15:41.066 --> 15:44.233
I can't sing in front of all those people.

15:44.300 --> 15:48.400
Of course you can, sweetheart.
You're just a little nervous.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.333
They always get this way
before the talent portion.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.967
My Clarisse still gets butterflies
before she twirls her fire batons.

15:56.033 --> 15:58.367
Fire scares me.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.433
But I just remind her
that mommy is right offstage

16:01.500 --> 16:05.500
with a big bucket of baking soda.
Then she feels better.

16:05.967 --> 16:08.867
It scares me a lot.

16:08.934 --> 16:11.100
Well, anyway, good luck to you both.

16:11.433 --> 16:14.533
-Come on, Clarisse.
-Help me.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.667
Did you see that?

16:20.734 --> 16:23.800
Some people should not be allowed
near children.

16:23.867 --> 16:26.266
That poor little girl.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.333
What could be worse than having a mother
like that?

16:28.400 --> 16:30.567
Having a grandmother like that.

16:31.200 --> 16:35.233
Now, wait a minute, Rose.
I'm just doing this for Melissa.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.000
-She's been having a wonderful time.
-Has she?

16:38.066 --> 16:41.734
Yeah... Melissa, come here.
I want to ask you something.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.333
Tell me the truth.
You want to be here, don't you?

16:45.400 --> 16:48.367
You've been having a wonderful time,
haven't you?

16:48.433 --> 16:51.500
'Cause if you haven't been,
we'll leave right now.

16:51.567 --> 16:53.500
-She's on.
-Showtime!

16:54.300 --> 16:58.600
(piano plays)

17:01.600 --> 17:04.233
She's not singing.
Why? Why isn't she singing?

17:04.300 --> 17:07.367
-Well, she's just frozen solid.
-No. Melissa.

17:07.433 --> 17:08.734
Oh, gosh.
Melissa!

17:11.133 --> 17:12.600
That's your music, Melissa.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.667

Oh, uh, Melissa,
may I speak with you please?

18:20.300 --> 18:23.934
Could you wait a moment?
Someone's having a story read to her.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.700
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.734
"And the prince took
the princess to the castle

18:28.800 --> 18:32.700
and they lived happily ever after.
The end."

18:33.667 --> 18:36.333
-They didn't get married?
-That's implied.

18:49.266 --> 18:51.500
For what it's worth, I, um...

18:52.233 --> 18:55.734
I know it was a mistake
to make you do the pageant,

18:55.800 --> 18:58.667
a... a... and I'm truly very sorry.

19:04.700 --> 19:10.166
You know, your grandma feels real bad
about everything.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.867
What do you say we forgive her?

19:19.166 --> 19:24.233
Oh. You know,
you remind me so much of your mother...

19:24.633 --> 19:26.367
when she was your age.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.467
She used to get so mad at me.

19:30.233 --> 19:31.400
Then as she got older...

19:31.800 --> 19:34.633
seems like we just fought all the time...

19:35.266 --> 19:38.200
till finally one day,
we just stopped talking altogether.

19:40.467 --> 19:43.400
It wasn't till you were born
that we tried to make up, but...

19:44.700 --> 19:47.033
we still couldn't let go of the past.

19:48.767 --> 19:49.734
Oh...

19:50.300 --> 19:52.367
Melissa, I don't want
to go through that again.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.734
I would just die if I thought that was
going to happen to us.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.066
Melissa, I know you're just a little girl,

20:07.133 --> 20:08.967
but this is where you're
supposed to stop me

20:09.033 --> 20:10.567
and say, "I love you. Don't go."

20:12.867 --> 20:13.934
Why?

20:14.467 --> 20:16.400
Well, because you're from the south,
honey.

20:16.467 --> 20:17.734
It's just good manners.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.133
Of course I still love you.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.700
You're my grandma. I'm just mad at you.

20:25.233 --> 20:28.333
Ohh. Well...

20:28.400 --> 20:30.266
I can accept that...

20:30.734 --> 20:32.500
if you're still going to give me
another chance,

20:32.567 --> 20:36.200
'cause I still want to try
to be the best grandma in the whole world.

20:37.066 --> 20:39.433
Can I start calling you grandma again?

20:39.500 --> 20:42.266
Ohh! Of course you can.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.066
Just not around anybody in uniform.

20:47.433 --> 20:48.834
Ok?

It's a miracle.

21:18.867 --> 21:20.266
I can walk.

21:20.333 --> 21:24.533
Sophia, look at you. You're walking.
I just can't believe it.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.800
Me, neither.
Pretty amazing, eh, pussycat?

21:26.867 --> 21:30.066
-Mm-hmm.
-Congratulations, Sophia.

21:30.133 --> 21:32.066
I am so proud of you...

21:32.767 --> 21:35.900
but I suppose this means
that my work here is done.

21:37.166 --> 21:38.700
But don't you worry about me.

21:39.233 --> 21:43.400
As long as there's pain and suffering
in the world, I'll be ok.

21:50.367 --> 21:53.500
Well, now that I'm up,
I might as well do some shopping.

21:53.567 --> 21:58.266
Get back here,
you deceitful little Sicilian gecko!

22:04.066 --> 22:05.433
I wuv you.

22:08.934 --> 22:10.900
Too wittle, too wate.

22:14.266 --> 22:17.300
Ma, why did you lie to me?

22:17.767 --> 22:19.467
Because for the first time,

22:19.533 --> 22:23.200
somebody was paying attention to me,
pampering me.

22:23.266 --> 22:27.867
-It was nice. She made me feel special.
-How about the awful way

22:27.934 --> 22:30.767
-she made the rest of us feel?
-Hey, that was just gravy.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.867
Look, Ma, I know I don't pamper you...

22:36.233 --> 22:38.767
but the reason I make you
do things for yourself

22:38.834 --> 22:41.600
is because I want to keep you
active and vital.

22:42.033 --> 22:43.934
The best way to show I care

22:44.000 --> 22:47.767
is to make sure you don't settle
into old age.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.600
You make me vacuum and dust

22:50.667 --> 22:53.700
and scrape crusty stuff off the tile
because you love me?

22:55.433 --> 22:58.433
Honestly? It tickles me.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.300
-Pussycat!
-Oh, Ma!

23:11.066 --> 23:16.000
