I'll tell you something,
I'd love to fight you,

04:19.930 --> 04:23.430
but there is a law
in Milwaukee that says,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.100
"No cruelty to animals."

See, nobody ever listens to me.

07:04.460 --> 07:07.290

two TV sets.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.630
Are you kidding, Marion?

07:09.630 --> 07:12.550
Now why would a family
want two TV sets?

Well, can't we talk
about it, Dad?

08:17.110 --> 08:18.700
We'll talk about it when I get
back from bowling.

Hi.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.520
Oh, we won.
Mm-hmm.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.299
Well, you don't
sound very happy.

08:41.549 --> 08:45.140
Well, Potsie was pitching, see.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.140
And he beaned
the first six batters,

08:47.140 --> 08:49.030
and the other team
had to forfeit.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.320
Well, the important
thing is that you won.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.700
Good-bye.

08:57.700 --> 08:58.700
Dad, will you
explain why...

08:58.700 --> 09:00.210
Be patient
with her, Richie.

09:00.570 --> 09:03.160
She doesn't know
too much about baseball.

09:03.160 --> 09:07.080
She still thinks Babe Ruth
was named after a candy bar.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.920
Candy bar...

09:22.810 --> 09:23.760
Ahem.

That's cute.

09:39.860 --> 09:41.360
I'm going to Arnold's.
See you later, Rich.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.830
No, no wait,
Joanie, Joanie.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.790
No, it's funny enough
without you pretending

09:45.790 --> 09:47.540
to go out dressed like that.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.840
I don't think it's funny.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.290
I happen to think it's cool.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.210
Well, do Mom and Dad know

09:53.210 --> 09:55.210
that you're going
out like that?
Well, sure.

09:55.210 --> 09:57.710
They were talking about it
just before you came in.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.220
And they liked it?

09:59.220 --> 10:00.720
They were stunned.

10:02.220 --> 10:04.690
Well, look,
before you go out, uh...

10:04.690 --> 10:06.220
I think you'd better
sit down here,

10:06.220 --> 10:08.220
and we'd better
try and have

10:08.220 --> 10:09.730
a brother
and sister talk.

10:09.730 --> 10:11.230
I'll be the brother

10:11.230 --> 10:13.730
and you try and
be the sister.

10:13.730 --> 10:16.230
I've got to change
this dirty uniform.

10:16.230 --> 10:17.730

10:20.900 --> 10:23.990
What a nerd.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.830
I'll give him ha-ha-ha.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.660
(Fats Domino's
"I'm Walkin'" begins)

10:29.800 --> 10:31.380
♪ I'm walkin' ♪

10:31.380 --> 10:33.220
♪ Yes, indeed I'm talkin'... ♪

10:33.470 --> 10:35.970
Come on, Herbie.
Come on, Herbie.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.750
Hey.
(all cheering)

10:40.170 --> 10:42.170
(wolf whistles)

10:42.680 --> 10:44.180
Hey, good-lookin'.

10:44.180 --> 10:46.180
Don't you recognize me?

10:46.180 --> 10:47.510
Hey, Herbie,

10:47.760 --> 10:49.730
it's that, uh, girl that
wouldn't dance with you.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.350
Good eyes, Leroy.

10:52.570 --> 10:55.660
I didn't recognize her all
dressed up nice like that.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.160
Say, uh... (clears throat)

10:57.160 --> 10:59.160
Maybe you'd like
to come to our

10:59.160 --> 11:01.160
Red Devil party
tonight, huh?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.660
Sure, I'll go.

11:02.660 --> 11:05.000
I live for parties.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.830
Ooh...

11:06.830 --> 11:08.330
Hey, fellas.

11:08.330 --> 11:11.340
Hot Stuff here wants to
come to a party tonight.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.340
Yeah!
Yeah.

11:12.340 --> 11:14.090
Hey, well,
look, uh, first, uh,

11:14.290 --> 11:15.880
I think we'd better get
the rest of the boys

11:15.880 --> 11:17.340
and stop by the tattoo parlor.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.130
Well, what am I supposed to do?

11:19.380 --> 11:20.960
Here's a nickel.
Get yourself some dinner.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.470
Come on, guys.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.690
Hey, Joanie, wait.

11:27.690 --> 11:30.190
Isn't it a little early
for Halloween?

11:30.190 --> 11:32.190
Sit on it, Malph.

11:32.190 --> 11:34.190
(Red Devils cheering)

11:38.700 --> 11:41.700
Boy, has she changed.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.200
Yeah, I think she did
something to her hair.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.800
Hey, Rich,
it's about time.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.800
Oh, great. Let's go
to the movies.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.800
No, no, I've got
no time for movies.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.800
Have you seen Joanie
around here?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.300
Oh, yeah, Rich,
I couldn't believe it.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.810
She was leaving with
the Red Devils

12:03.810 --> 12:04.810
when we came in.

12:04.810 --> 12:06.260
She went with Herbie
to their party.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.060
Ah, I never should
have laughed at her.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.980
Oh, forget that.
You'd just better find out

12:10.980 --> 12:11.980
where the party is.
Yeah.

12:11.980 --> 12:12.980
They always
have their parties

12:12.980 --> 12:14.770
at Roadhouse Number Four.

12:14.930 --> 12:16.520
Way to go, Rich.
Yeah. Thanks.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.020
But you won't
find her there.

12:18.020 --> 12:19.520
No?
Not yet, anyway.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.410
In order for a girl to go
to one of their parties,

12:21.690 --> 12:25.190
she has to be initiated
into the Red Devils.

12:25.490 --> 12:28.080
"Initiated"?

12:28.580 --> 12:29.580
Oh. Oh, what do they do?

12:29.580 --> 12:31.580
They blindfold her and
feed her spaghetti,

12:31.580 --> 12:33.590
and pretend that it's
worms or something, right?

12:33.590 --> 12:35.590
Yeah, that's fun.
I like that. Yeah.

12:38.960 --> 12:39.840
That's for kids.

12:40.130 --> 12:41.130
Well, what?
What do they do?

12:41.510 --> 12:44.100
I can't tell, it's a secret.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.510
But I loved it.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.050
Tell me, what is it?
What do they do?

12:50.350 --> 12:52.690
You have to neck with
every member of the gang.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.060
Oh, yeah?

12:54.060 --> 12:57.640
Well, we have a little gang
of our own right here.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.700
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.280
Not now, Ralph.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.950
All right, now,
where is this, uh, initiation?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.040
I can't tell,
I'm sworn to secrecy.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.450
Don't give me...

13:08.450 --> 13:09.960
This is my sister.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.370
We're talking about my sister,
don't you understand that?

13:12.370 --> 13:14.460
The last one
that squealed on Herbie

13:14.460 --> 13:15.960
is now called Baldy,

13:15.960 --> 13:19.470
and I, Becky Bronski,
like my hair.

13:19.470 --> 13:21.720
Sorry, pal.

13:21.720 --> 13:22.720
Sorry.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.220
(giggles)

13:24.220 --> 13:26.720
She... she
tweaked my tummy.

13:30.090 --> 13:32.680
Let me tell you something, I'm
gonna go find those Red Devils,

13:32.680 --> 13:34.730
and when I do,
they're gonna be really sorry.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.930
No, you are, Rich--
remember, there's eight of them.

13:36.930 --> 13:39.520
I don't care about that;
I'm gonna find my sister.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.170
Just relax, kid,
I'm telling you,

13:54.170 --> 13:56.170
we got the okay
to use the school.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.250
Well, then, why did we come
through the window?

13:58.250 --> 14:00.120
Are you sure
there's a party here?

14:00.120 --> 14:03.210
Well, we got a special
surprise for you.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.710
You're gonna be initiated
into the Red Devils.

14:06.710 --> 14:07.680
RED DEVILS:
Yeah.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.850
You get to be in the
gang after you...

14:09.850 --> 14:12.690
neck with each and
every Red Devil.

14:12.690 --> 14:14.270
(Red Devils smacking lips)

14:14.270 --> 14:15.640
(sighs)

14:15.640 --> 14:17.610
You see, we do
everything together.

14:17.610 --> 14:20.190
RED DEVILS:
That's right.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.690
No, I don't think so.

14:22.190 --> 14:23.200
I mean, it's nothing personal,

14:23.200 --> 14:26.450
but I don't even kiss
on the first date.

14:26.450 --> 14:28.030
Thanks, but, uh,
I don't think I want

14:28.030 --> 14:29.790
to be a Red Devil
after all,

14:29.790 --> 14:31.370
so I'll just be going.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.910
Uh, listen, I have
a lot of homework and...

14:33.910 --> 14:35.990
HERBIE:
The girl has a sense
of humor.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.740
Get away from my sister!

14:41.550 --> 14:43.550
Oh, Richie, am I
glad to see you.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.830
How did you
ever find me?

14:44.830 --> 14:46.840
I saw their motorcycles
out front.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.090
Get lost.

14:48.090 --> 14:49.170
I'm going to.

14:49.170 --> 14:50.890
And I'm taking my sister
with me.

14:50.890 --> 14:51.970
Yeah.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.890
You have to get
through my boys first.

14:53.890 --> 14:56.480
RED DEVILS:
That's right.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.480
Oh.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.570
Well, uh, you guys do
what you have to do, but, uh,

15:02.570 --> 15:04.650
I just want you to know
that you're dealing with...

15:04.650 --> 15:06.660
Iron Dukes Cunningham!

15:06.660 --> 15:08.160
JOANIE:
Yeah.

15:08.160 --> 15:11.860
You just never know--
I can't make any guarantees--

15:11.860 --> 15:12.950
but one of these iron fists

15:12.950 --> 15:15.030
just might land
on one of your mouths.

15:15.030 --> 15:16.830
Ah, throw him in a locker.

15:16.830 --> 15:17.780
Right.

15:29.630 --> 15:33.020
Well, if it ain't the turkey
and his feathers.

15:34.430 --> 15:36.440
Take it easy, take it easy.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.600
There's eight of us.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.690
Get over here...
get over here, Shortcake.

15:39.690 --> 15:42.690
You went pretty heavy
on the icing there, huh?

15:45.140 --> 15:48.030
Iron Dukes, I think you
did an incredible job here.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.110
I just thought
maybe you

15:49.110 --> 15:50.070
might need some
extra help, you know?

15:50.620 --> 15:53.570
Oh, well, uh, I can
always use an extra hand.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.650
You're gonna need
a lot of extra hands.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.160
You're a little outnumbered.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.070
RED DEVILS:
That's right.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.330
(laughing)

16:12.300 --> 16:13.310
(Ralph yelping)

16:27.400 --> 16:28.350
Hi, guys.

16:28.900 --> 16:29.910
The door was stuck.

16:29.910 --> 16:30.820
The door was really
stuck, Fonz.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.190
How did you guys know
where I was?

16:34.690 --> 16:36.700
Well, Becky told me
where you were.

16:36.700 --> 16:39.330
Yeah, I guess you had
to beat it out of her.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.420
I guess I had to...
kiss it out of her.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.000
All right, Fonz.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.090
Well, this is your gang?

16:44.590 --> 16:45.090
FONZIE:
That's right.

16:45.590 --> 16:47.090
Three high school punks?

16:47.090 --> 16:49.590
What are they gonna do,
throw chalk at us?

16:49.590 --> 16:51.210
(Red Devils laughing)

16:51.210 --> 16:54.300
Not exactly-- see, they're here
to carry you out.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.800
See, an old friend happened
to come and visit me.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.220
(snaps fingers)

16:59.220 --> 17:02.600
♪ You know I'd go
from rags to riches. ♪

17:19.040 --> 17:20.540
I'll tell you something.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.829
I love your feet,
you know that?

17:22.829 --> 17:24.490
FONZIE:
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

17:24.490 --> 17:26.579
I want you
to meet Carmine Ragusa.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.130
Of the Marjorie
Ward Dance School.

17:29.130 --> 17:32.720
What's he gonna do,
tango us to death?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.550
(Red Devils laughing)

17:34.550 --> 17:36.140
Carmine Ragusa...

17:36.140 --> 17:39.730
is also Golden Gloves
champion of Milwaukee.

17:39.730 --> 17:41.930
Oh, that Carmine Ragusa.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.510
That's right.

17:44.510 --> 17:45.850
CARMINE:
Excuse me while I warm up
for a second here.

17:45.850 --> 17:46.930
Yeah.

17:46.930 --> 17:49.020
(takes deep breath)

17:49.020 --> 17:51.100
You ready now?
Yeah, I think I'm
warmed up here.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.100
How about you, huh?

17:52.100 --> 17:53.610
Aren't you
gonna warm up?
Yeah.

17:53.610 --> 17:54.770
I'm warm.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.860
Let's go.
Wait, wait, stop it!

17:56.860 --> 17:58.360
Joanie, you get
over there by the stands.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.360
No, no, this whole thing
is my fault,

18:00.360 --> 18:01.860
and I don't want
everybody hurt

18:01.860 --> 18:03.370
just because I did
a dumb thing.

18:03.370 --> 18:05.170
She's making sense.
Yeah.

18:07.950 --> 18:10.960
All right... if you want
to be stupid, then fight.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.960
I'm going home, but on the way,

18:12.960 --> 18:16.460
I'm stopping at Jenny Piccalo's
and give her a punch.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.550
Get out of my way.

18:20.550 --> 18:23.600
All right, now,
just before we start,

18:23.600 --> 18:25.690
Richie, Potsie, Ralph,
retire yourself.

18:25.690 --> 18:26.970
Right, Fonz.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.060
Anything
you say, Fonz.

18:28.060 --> 18:30.060
Hey, wait a minute,
Potsie, Ralph, come here.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.730
Don't you see
what's happening here?

18:32.730 --> 18:34.310
We're almost 18 years old,

18:34.310 --> 18:37.820
and Fonzie still fights
all our battles for us.

18:37.820 --> 18:38.780
Fonz?
Yeah?

18:38.780 --> 18:42.820
Do you realize I've only
had two fights in my life?

18:42.820 --> 18:47.830
One of them was with a
department store sales lady.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.830
This is one fight
that we're gonna

18:49.830 --> 18:51.800
handle ourselves,
right, guys?

18:51.800 --> 18:54.830
Uh, yeah, right.
Okay, I guess.

18:54.830 --> 18:56.920
All right, all
right... now, you,

18:56.920 --> 18:59.840
you just pick out three
of your toughest guys.

18:59.840 --> 19:03.140
Oh, come on, I'll pick
out three of my weakest.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.180
Better.

19:06.350 --> 19:07.930
Okay, Red, listen,
if you want

19:07.930 --> 19:09.930
to fight this battle on
your own, you go right ahead.

19:10.430 --> 19:11.930
That's cool as a moose,
you understand?

19:11.930 --> 19:13.440
We'll sit this one out.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.440
That goes
for you, Herbie,

19:14.440 --> 19:16.660
and little Leroy
over there, you sit down.

19:16.660 --> 19:17.740
Uh, what?

19:17.740 --> 19:19.830
Are you expecting me
just to sit around?

19:19.830 --> 19:22.410
That's right, how would you
like to <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">lie around{\r}?</font></font></i>

19:22.410 --> 19:25.280
(nasally):
Oh, well, I'll just
sit back over here.

19:28.670 --> 19:29.590
Sit down!

19:34.960 --> 19:37.210
(murmuring)

19:37.210 --> 19:39.090
Fight at will.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.180
We're all scared, Ralph.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.430
Just...
just do your best.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.970
Hi-yah!
Let's go!

19:58.650 --> 20:00.150
Hey, Richie, you're
doing great.

20:00.150 --> 20:01.120
Go get 'em, tiger.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.030
Watch out behind you.

20:05.570 --> 20:07.160
I'll bet you two dollars
on the bag.
Yeah.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.630
Just a minute!
Hold this!

20:14.130 --> 20:15.550
Hey, you, buddy!

20:15.550 --> 20:16.800
(yells)
Help!

20:18.470 --> 20:20.640
Didn't we see this in
a Three Stooges movie?

20:20.640 --> 20:22.220
(shouting)

20:22.220 --> 20:23.670
(groaning)

20:33.070 --> 20:35.070
RALPH:
Potsie, the rope!

20:35.070 --> 20:36.070
Get him
with the rope!

20:36.070 --> 20:37.650
Come on!
(yelling)

20:37.650 --> 20:38.990

I got to tell you something,

You were superbamundo,

21:28.070 --> 21:29.570
That goes for you, too.

21:30.070 --> 21:30.960
Thanks, Fonz.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.540
Now, I think
these guys proved

21:32.540 --> 21:34.540
that, uh, they're
pretty strong here.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.380
Let's just pick up our wounded
and go home.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.800
I'll tell you when
to go home, Arthur.

21:41.130 --> 21:44.140
