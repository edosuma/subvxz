OLIVIA:
<i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

00:05.441 --> 00:08.111
BROYLES: <i>We're recorded him</i>
<i>at over three dozen scenes,</i>

00:08.146 --> 00:09.485
<i>all of which relate</i>
<i>to the Pattern.</i>

00:09.664 --> 00:11.232

00:11.267 --> 00:12.586
BROYLES:
<i>Watching. Observing.</i>

00:13.996 --> 00:15.712
We refer to him
as the Observer.

00:15.747 --> 00:16.962
WALTER:
We were dead, Peter.

00:17.515 --> 00:18.920
Until someone grabbed me.

00:19.096 --> 00:22.357
We were saved, both of us,
by a man that I had never met.

00:22.730 --> 00:23.693
You talk to him?

00:23.764 --> 00:25.238
<i>He wouldn't be</i>
<i>any use to you.</i>

00:25.273 --> 00:26.409
He just observes.

00:26.497 --> 00:27.991
I have said too much.

00:28.026 --> 00:29.597
I'm not supposed
to get involved.

I've never seen anything
like them before.

01:15.563 --> 01:17.302
They're from somewhere
far away.

01:20.128 --> 01:21.413
I don't have any money.

01:21.744 --> 01:22.976
Oh, that's okay.

01:23.230 --> 01:24.606
I'm gonna give you
one of these anyway.

01:29.845 --> 01:30.517
There.

01:31.063 --> 01:32.313
Oh, that's great.

"August"

03:24.777 --> 03:25.666
Morning.

03:28.996 --> 03:29.897
[chuckles]

03:30.463 --> 03:31.964
Good morning, funny face.

03:32.530 --> 03:33.825
You ready for our day?

03:33.906 --> 03:34.698
Yep.

03:36.230 --> 03:38.139
This is the map
Mom left for us.

03:38.174 --> 03:40.412
There's four rollercoasters.

03:40.447 --> 03:41.397
Oh, no, no, no.
We agreed.

03:41.463 --> 03:42.541
No rollercoasters.

03:42.542 --> 03:44.699
You can go on any other ride
you like, but no rollercoasters

03:44.734 --> 03:46.730
'cause I am scared of
the rollercoasters.

03:46.796 --> 03:47.724
[giggles]

03:47.763 --> 03:48.928
Oh, you think that's funny?

03:49.563 --> 03:50.960
You think that
that is funny?

03:50.995 --> 03:52.730
Okay, no rollercoasters.

03:52.796 --> 03:53.750
- [laughs]
- [cell phone rings]

03:54.896 --> 03:56.369
Hang on.
Dunham.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.240
Where?

04:08.530 --> 04:10.830
Uh, no, I'll tell
Walter and Peter.

04:17.164 --> 04:17.958
So.

04:18.196 --> 04:20.130
We're gonna have to take
a rain check.

04:21.596 --> 04:22.729
That's okay, Aunt Liv.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.587
I know you have
an important job.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.176
Well, I'm gonna call
the Jacobsens

04:33.196 --> 04:35.164
and see
if they can babysit.

04:35.523 --> 04:37.349
And then I'll--

04:37.384 --> 04:39.020
- Make pancakes?
- Yes.

04:39.021 --> 04:40.974
[laughs]
And I'll make you pancakes.

04:41.563 --> 04:43.383
- [birds chirping]
- [dogs barking in distance]

04:43.829 --> 04:45.387
Are you sure
it was him?

04:45.730 --> 04:47.929
Uh, we don't have
the security footage yet,

04:47.996 --> 04:49.963
but an eyewitness said
that he was wearing

04:50.030 --> 04:51.563
a gray suit and a hat,

04:51.630 --> 04:54.496
"One of those old ones
from the '60s."

04:55.124 --> 04:56.655
You don't have any information
on the girl?

04:56.885 --> 04:57.514
No.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.997
The police showed her picture
around the museum,

05:00.032 --> 05:01.359
but no one knew
who she was.

05:01.929 --> 05:03.265
Hey, is Walter awake?

05:03.463 --> 05:04.471
[scoffs]
Oh, yeah.

05:05.163 --> 05:06.499
- He's in--
- [blender turns on]

05:07.096 --> 05:08.206
the kitchen.

05:08.896 --> 05:10.787
And talking to him's
not gonna be easy.

05:11.076 --> 05:11.539
Why?

05:12.282 --> 05:12.846
Walter!

05:13.363 --> 05:14.562
We have company.

05:16.463 --> 05:17.849
Oh, hello, Agent Dunham.

05:18.530 --> 05:19.782
Walter, hey.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.414
I need you to tell me
what you know

05:23.449 --> 05:25.241
about the man we call
"the Observer."

05:26.565 --> 05:28.112
You once referred to him
as your friend.

05:28.330 --> 05:30.583
And it seems that he may
have kidnapped a woman.

05:30.915 --> 05:33.799
They call it
"the Strawberry Supreme."

05:34.361 --> 05:36.267
<i>His favorite ice cream store</i>
<i>is shut down.</i>

05:36.790 --> 05:39.112
He made me wait in line with him
for four hours yesterday

05:39.147 --> 05:40.587
just so he could have
one last milkshake.

05:40.622 --> 05:42.191
They have a secret ingredient.
It's--

05:42.663 --> 05:45.366
It's mundane but it's--
Oh, it's sublime.

05:45.508 --> 05:47.135
And I am trying
to stimulate

05:47.170 --> 05:50.949
my olfactory
and gustatory senses

05:50.984 --> 05:51.958
to try to recreate it.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.996
Walter?
Can you come with me?

05:56.645 --> 05:59.622
We've recorded him at over
three dozen fringe events.

06:00.397 --> 06:01.420
Do you remember him?

06:02.464 --> 06:03.266
Of course.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.927
But there's nothing more
than I've told you before.

06:08.829 --> 06:10.730
Peter and I were in
a car crash.

06:10.765 --> 06:12.688
In a frozen lake,
when I was a boy.

06:13.397 --> 06:14.921
<i>We were drowning,</i>
<i>and...</i>

06:16.397 --> 06:17.983
he dove in and saved us.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.022
But you say he's kidnapped
a woman?

06:23.413 --> 06:24.588
We think he may have.

06:24.623 --> 06:26.841
Why? What are you
thinking, Walter?

06:28.239 --> 06:29.203
ASTRID:
<i>Hey, guys?</i>

06:29.238 --> 06:30.842
The footage from the abduction

06:30.877 --> 06:31.797
<i>has been downloaded.</i>

06:32.196 --> 06:36.007
Also, the police found a book
on a bench by the museum

06:36.042 --> 06:37.943
that had some kind of
weird writing in it.

06:37.978 --> 06:39.272
And they think it was his?

06:39.430 --> 06:40.629
Well, they don't know,

06:40.630 --> 06:42.199
but Agent Broyles
is sending it over.

06:43.393 --> 06:44.780
Have we I.D.'ed
the victim?

06:44.896 --> 06:45.764
No, not yet.

06:47.363 --> 06:48.153
Wait a minute, Astrid.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.045
Can you zoom in?

06:52.230 --> 06:53.576
[typing on keyboard]

06:54.297 --> 06:55.363
<i>Now freeze it.</i>

06:57.832 --> 06:58.876
Peter, that isn't him.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.716
<i>That's a different guy.</i>

07:05.679 --> 07:07.053
There's more than
one observer.

07:08.497 --> 07:10.096
[typing]

07:11.881 --> 07:13.088
Stop.
Ho--hold on.

07:13.339 --> 07:14.407
What just happened
right there?

07:15.463 --> 07:17.667
[typing]

07:22.622 --> 07:23.484
Was he hit?

07:23.597 --> 07:25.130
[typing]

07:33.855 --> 07:35.453
Who are these people?

07:58.942 --> 08:00.447
- Please don't hurt me.
- Please don't hurt me.

08:01.688 --> 08:03.111
- Why are you doing this?
- Why are you doing this?

08:04.081 --> 08:05.245
- Please let me go.
- Please let me go.

08:06.344 --> 08:08.152
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.

08:08.153 --> 08:09.998
- You don't have to do this to me.
- You don't have to do this to me.

08:21.448 --> 08:22.342
- Please.
- Please.

08:26.245 --> 08:29.830
It will be safer...
if you stay quiet.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.354
BROYLES:
<i>Her name's Christine Hollis.</i>

08:43.198 --> 08:45.245
<i>27 years old in</i>
<i>the masters program</i>

08:45.312 --> 08:46.341
<i>for Fine Arts at B.U.</i>

08:47.512 --> 08:49.213
<i>As far as we can tell,</i>
<i>she's no one special.</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:50.322
Her parents are deceased.

08:50.357 --> 08:52.065
No siblings,
no arrest record.

08:52.066 --> 08:53.836
$2,700 in her bank account.

08:54.546 --> 08:55.950
Nothing unusual
about her at all.

08:56.079 --> 08:57.283
Well, do we have
a home address?

08:57.318 --> 08:58.377
We're working on it now.

08:59.270 --> 09:00.854
Assuming
she's still alive.

09:01.089 --> 09:03.014
We have no reason yet
to think otherwise.

09:03.679 --> 09:05.381
Well, that's just it,
isn't it?

09:05.701 --> 09:07.393
I mean, we don't know
what to think.

09:08.486 --> 09:09.930
I--I'm lost.

09:10.647 --> 09:13.478
24 years ago, one of them
saved Walter and Peter.

09:13.601 --> 09:15.865
Walter doesn't know why,
or he can't remember.

09:16.092 --> 09:17.005
But beyond that,

09:17.033 --> 09:18.871
everything we know about
these guys,

09:18.906 --> 09:21.534
the little that there is
suggests that they just watch.

09:21.918 --> 09:22.900
They don't get involved.

09:23.125 --> 09:23.917
But now...

09:26.000 --> 09:28.031
Figure out why he took
this girl.

09:28.381 --> 09:30.025
<i>What makes her</i>
<i>the exception.</i>

09:33.440 --> 09:35.153
Do that, and I think
you'll find him.

09:38.046 --> 09:40.243
PETER: <i>Hey, I think we may</i>
<i>have a lead on the Observer.</i>

09:41.393 --> 09:43.551
Walter. Look at this.
In his book.

09:44.463 --> 09:46.612
I think
that might be blood.

09:47.606 --> 09:48.718
You might be right, son.

09:50.103 --> 09:51.266
The scalpel, please.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.500
Did he ever tell you
why he saved us?

09:57.064 --> 09:57.867
The Observer.

09:59.962 --> 10:01.013
No.

10:03.698 --> 10:04.713
We're close, Walter.

10:05.677 --> 10:06.588
Whatever's going on,

10:06.623 --> 10:08.569
whatever William Bell
was warning Olivia about,

10:08.866 --> 10:10.854
these people have
the answers, I know it.

10:10.889 --> 10:11.893
- I can feel it.
- Mm-hmm.

10:11.967 --> 10:13.821
This does not make
any sense.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.151
What?

10:15.966 --> 10:17.036
His handwriting.

10:17.037 --> 10:17.513
[beeping]

10:17.697 --> 10:21.796
<i>So far, I have counted</i>
<i>1,246 distinct characters</i>

10:21.831 --> 10:23.207
<i>and not</i>
<i>a single one of them</i>

10:23.242 --> 10:24.788
- repeats.
- All right.

10:24.823 --> 10:26.752
Not all of us majored
in linguistics.

10:27.273 --> 10:29.240
It means that
every written language

10:29.275 --> 10:30.402
is based on repetition.

10:30.681 --> 10:33.753
So without repeated symbols,
language is not possible.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.207
Well, maybe it's a code.

10:35.992 --> 10:36.937
<i>Maybe.</i>

10:37.314 --> 10:39.712
<i>But if so, it is the most</i>
<i>complicated code</i>

10:39.747 --> 10:40.505
<i>I have ever seen.</i>

10:40.714 --> 10:42.914
<i>The computer can't make</i>
<i>any sense of this either.</i>

10:42.949 --> 10:43.516
[door closes]

10:43.653 --> 10:44.456
Hey, what you got?

10:44.995 --> 10:46.622
Nothing concrete
on the symbols yet.

10:46.657 --> 10:48.363
But we found a blood sample
in the book.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.276
The kidnapper's blood?

10:49.415 --> 10:50.930
<i>Not sure.</i>
<i>Walter's analyzing it now.</i>

10:51.964 --> 10:52.697
Walter.

10:53.107 --> 10:57.331
Well, we can't be certain
till we run the labs,

10:57.366 --> 11:01.222
but I've noticed the blood
has an orange tint,

11:01.570 --> 11:03.444
perhaps
a sign of hemophilia.

11:03.735 --> 11:07.196
Well, if it is his blood
and if he's a hemophiliac,

11:07.231 --> 11:08.741
then maybe he was treated
in a hospital,

11:08.776 --> 11:10.086
<i>so there could be</i>
<i>a record.</i>

11:10.121 --> 11:11.414
I'll call Broyles.
Have him put together a list

11:11.445 --> 11:13.007
of all the known hemophiliacs
in the area.

11:13.042 --> 11:14.694
Hey, guys,
I think I found something.

11:15.006 --> 11:16.256
<i>It looks</i>
<i>like someone else</i>

11:16.291 --> 11:18.345
has been investigating
these symbols too.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.511
OLIVIA: <i>What?</i>

11:21.037 --> 11:21.608
Who is it?

11:26.481 --> 11:28.491
Yeah, these things have been
blowing my mind

11:28.526 --> 11:29.357
for a while now.

11:29.392 --> 11:31.922
Do you see the little
half-circle with wings?

11:32.191 --> 11:34.260
That appears on
a cuneiform tablet

11:34.330 --> 11:35.975
at the Iraqi National Museum.

11:36.057 --> 11:38.735
It's one of mankind's
earliest attempts at writing.

11:38.770 --> 11:41.739
And, uh, do you see this little
triangular curlycue thingie?

11:41.858 --> 11:44.140
That's etched on
the Iron Pillar of Delhi.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.577
900, B.C.
It's pretty weird, right?

11:46.578 --> 11:48.907
So Nina Sharp says
you're FBI too.

11:49.192 --> 11:51.592
Uh... you don't look FBI.

11:52.324 --> 11:55.172
So you have no idea
what any of them mean.

11:55.624 --> 11:57.414
- What the symbols mean?
- Yeah.

11:58.091 --> 11:59.114
No, I have no idea.

12:00.691 --> 12:02.043
But I found something else.

12:04.094 --> 12:06.291
We all remember
Paul Revere's ride,

12:06.326 --> 12:07.967
"One if by land,
two if by sea,"

12:08.002 --> 12:09.038
but before that,

12:09.109 --> 12:13.838
he was famous for his engraving
of the Boston Massacre.

12:14.235 --> 12:15.946
<i>1770.</i>

12:21.971 --> 12:22.825
Oh, come on.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.635
Well, that could be
anybody.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.012
- [hits key]
- [beep]

12:27.893 --> 12:29.108
Marie Antoinette.

12:31.205 --> 12:32.852
<i>1793.</i>

12:38.046 --> 12:38.389
- [hits key]
- [beep]

12:39.391 --> 12:41.130
Sarajevo, 1914.

12:41.165 --> 12:44.714
<i>Minutes before Archduke</i>
<i>Franz Ferdinand was shot,</i>

12:45.291 --> 12:47.190
<i>kicking off World War I.</i>

12:47.526 --> 12:49.122
So they have been around
forever.

12:49.387 --> 12:51.591
Or else,
they're not limited

12:51.658 --> 12:53.901
by our human perception
of time.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.375
Are you with me?

12:59.169 --> 13:01.224
We think of time
as linear, right?

13:01.259 --> 13:02.227
Life is a journey.

13:02.340 --> 13:04.464
You're born,
and then you die.

13:05.025 --> 13:07.231
And to get from one end
to the other,

13:08.689 --> 13:11.357
<i>there's only one way</i>
<i>through.</i>

13:13.878 --> 13:15.174
Unless...

13:15.728 --> 13:17.311
you look at it
like this...

13:19.458 --> 13:21.057
and then...

13:22.272 --> 13:24.933
you can see
at any point.

13:26.758 --> 13:28.117
It's all happening
at once.

13:30.658 --> 13:32.624
So they're traveling
through time.

13:32.998 --> 13:33.257
<i>No.</i>

13:34.124 --> 13:36.370
It's more like
they're observing time.

13:37.518 --> 13:41.635
<i>I think these guys</i>
<i>show up</i>

13:41.696 --> 13:43.569
at important moments.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.546
Um, historical,
technological, scientific.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.634
But it's rare.

13:49.985 --> 13:52.453
<i>Maybe two dozen different</i>

13:52.973 --> 13:56.709
definite occurrences
in the past 5,000 years

13:56.744 --> 13:58.022
of human history.

13:58.457 --> 14:01.958
But recently,
I've charted 26 sightings

14:02.025 --> 14:04.552
in the past
three months alone.

14:05.362 --> 14:06.709
<i>It kind of</i>
<i>makes you wonder.</i>

14:07.102 --> 14:07.985
Why now?

14:08.846 --> 14:10.479
And what's about
to happen.

14:12.804 --> 14:13.923
More hot sauce, gentlemen?

14:17.251 --> 14:18.794
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

14:34.648 --> 14:36.065
We have a situation
with August.

14:47.391 --> 14:49.496
- <i>Who is she?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

14:49.925 --> 14:52.741
But she's supposed to be on
Tropos Air, Flight 821.

14:58.079 --> 14:59.755
Why did he abduct her?

15:00.728 --> 15:01.638
<i>We don't know.</i>

15:02.192 --> 15:04.411
And the flight has
already left the terminal.

15:05.293 --> 15:07.574
Then he's created
an irregularity.

15:07.934 --> 15:09.253
We'll need to repair it.

15:10.925 --> 15:12.522
Contact Donald.

15:58.610 --> 15:59.963
WOMAN:
<i>I just don't understand it.</i>

16:00.807 --> 16:02.410
Why would anyone want to
kidnap Christine?

16:02.477 --> 16:03.943
Well, that's what we're trying
to figure out.

16:04.877 --> 16:06.357
So you two
aren't roommates.

16:06.392 --> 16:07.560
No. We're friends.

16:07.844 --> 16:09.958
Taking a bunch of sculpture
classes together.

16:10.644 --> 16:12.657
<i>I'm subletting her room</i>
<i>while she's away.</i>

16:13.309 --> 16:14.485
Was supposed
to be away.

16:15.046 --> 16:16.144
Where was she
supposed to be?

16:16.431 --> 16:17.175
Italy.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.504
She was supposed
to fly today.

16:20.211 --> 16:22.085
She was gonna spend
the semester

16:22.120 --> 16:23.510
studying ceramics in Rome.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.979
Well, do you have a copy
of her itinerary?

16:26.443 --> 16:27.977
Her flight to Rome, or...

16:28.291 --> 16:29.648
maybe where
she was gonna be staying?

16:29.683 --> 16:30.477
<i>She emailed me one.</i>

16:30.543 --> 16:31.644
<i>I can print out</i>
<i>a copy for you.</i>

16:32.752 --> 16:33.790
Is this Christine?

16:34.244 --> 16:35.020
Yeah.

16:35.121 --> 16:37.681
It's a terrible story,
actually.

16:38.111 --> 16:40.825
Her family was visiting
relatives in San Francisco.

16:41.487 --> 16:43.046
A few hours after
that photo was taken,

16:43.081 --> 16:44.251
there was
a big earthquake.

16:44.777 --> 16:45.789
The one in '89?

16:46.477 --> 16:47.805
They were driving
on that bridge

16:47.840 --> 16:50.586
when it happened,
when it collapsed.

16:51.132 --> 16:52.399
Her parents
were both killed.

16:53.844 --> 16:55.267
That's the last photo
she has of them.

16:56.677 --> 16:59.316
I'll, um, get you
her travel information.

17:04.710 --> 17:05.684
Take a look at this.

17:06.744 --> 17:07.739

18:30.344 --> 18:31.731
You've hurt yourself.

18:37.841 --> 18:39.376
Why are you doing this?

18:40.911 --> 18:42.388
What do you want
from me?

18:44.574 --> 18:46.936
It would be easier
to show you.

18:53.944 --> 18:56.510
WOMAN: <i>Popularity polls continue</i>

<i>Calling the Jacobsens.</i>

19:21.410 --> 19:23.071
Whatever these Observers do
to keep from aging,

19:23.106 --> 19:24.090
they should market it.

19:24.125 --> 19:25.181
They'd make a fortune.

19:25.944 --> 19:27.047
So what does it mean,

19:27.224 --> 19:30.825
that he has been keeping tabs
on this girl for 20 years?

19:31.378 --> 19:32.098

19:32.610 --> 19:34.680
Oh, Ken, hi.
It's Olivia Dunham.

19:34.893 --> 19:36.447
I'm just calling

19:36.482 --> 19:38.041
and say hi to my niece.

19:38.111 --> 19:38.772
KEN: <i>Oh.</i>

19:39.211 --> 19:40.712
Jane just took her out
for ice cream.

19:40.877 --> 19:42.011
You want me to call her
and have her--

19:42.077 --> 19:45.361
Uh, no, no, uh--
Just let her know that I called.

19:45.610 --> 19:46.393

Yeah.
For the weekend.

19:55.496 --> 19:56.111
And?

19:57.242 --> 19:57.810
And what?

19:58.229 --> 20:00.311
You do that thing with
your mouth when you're upset.

20:01.479 --> 20:02.277
[chuckles]

20:02.594 --> 20:05.707
Oh, it's-- Ella and I had
this whole day

20:05.742 --> 20:08.853
at the amusement park planned,
and then dinner after.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.893
<i>She was completely</i>
<i>understanding</i>

20:11.928 --> 20:13.293
when I told her
that I had to work.

20:22.244 --> 20:24.957
When my mom took me to
my first movie when I was six,

20:25.911 --> 20:27.134
I was so excited.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.204
She bought me a box
of popcorn, and...

20:29.766 --> 20:30.774
we took our seats.

20:30.845 --> 20:31.936
You know, they used to have
that curtain

20:32.015 --> 20:33.180
<i>before the movie started?</i>

20:33.644 --> 20:35.653
<i>It was this beautiful</i>
<i>red velvet.</i>

20:36.276 --> 20:38.021
We sat there eating popcorn.

20:38.993 --> 20:41.582
And after a couple minutes,
I turned to her and said,

20:41.633 --> 20:43.593
"Mommy, this is
the best movie ever."

20:44.011 --> 20:45.848
I didn't understand
that it hadn't started.

20:49.177 --> 20:51.800
It's one of my favorite memories
of my mother.

20:54.861 --> 20:57.105

of memories with Ella.

I mean, what if he somehow
knew the plane was gonna crash?

22:29.011 --> 22:30.625
So you think this Brandon guy
was right?

22:30.660 --> 22:32.221
That they can see the events
before they happen.

22:32.574 --> 22:34.581
I'm sorry,
what plane crash?

22:35.494 --> 22:37.165
Christine Hollis was supposed
to be on a plane

22:37.200 --> 22:38.710

the coast of Italy.

22:39.011 --> 22:41.008
- 200 people were killed.
- Oh, dear.

22:41.211 --> 22:43.536

22:45.344 --> 22:47.517
What is so special about her?
Why save her?

save us?

22:55.044 --> 22:56.509
Oh. Oh.

22:57.532 --> 22:58.274
<i>[chuckles]</i>

22:58.326 --> 23:01.066
High concentration

it's not blood at all,

23:03.572 --> 23:05.649
it's chili pepper juice.

23:05.877 --> 23:07.541
He must have spilled some
in the book.

23:07.801 --> 23:10.491
Well, that's great news.
So we'll add "messy" to the APB.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.031
No, it is good news.

23:13.905 --> 23:17.557
Concentration at 970,000

<i>the King Cobra chili.</i>

23:28.679 --> 23:29.992

<i>Oh, I--I imagine so.</i>

23:40.677 --> 23:43.201

one could grow them here.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.421

23:45.456 --> 23:47.986
Locate anyone who's importing
those peppers locally.

Christine Hollis.

24:24.385 --> 24:27.460
I have observed this woman
for much of her life.

24:28.352 --> 24:29.661
She is unique.

24:29.961 --> 24:31.447
They are all unique.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.218
<i>That is not reason</i>
<i>to interfere</i>

24:34.253 --> 24:36.656
with the course
her life was meant to take.

24:37.287 --> 24:38.883
We have interfered before.

24:40.619 --> 24:43.917
Only to correct a mistake
of our own making.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.535
<i>She has no future.</i>

24:46.819 --> 24:48.378
Then why do I see it?

24:51.817 --> 24:53.712
Why do I see
that she is important?

24:56.371 --> 24:58.609
Your perception
must be in error.

25:04.785 --> 25:05.723
Perhaps.

25:07.018 --> 25:09.167
Your oversight
will be forgiven,

25:09.919 --> 25:12.440
but Miss Hollis
must be corrected.

25:13.109 --> 25:14.907
<i>We've already seen</i>
<i>to it.</i>

25:17.658 --> 25:18.437
PETER:
<i>You should eat something.</i>

25:18.472 --> 25:19.172
Thanks.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.049
You know,
if there's something significant

25:21.119 --> 25:22.613
about this girl,
I just don't see it.

25:23.151 --> 25:23.905
After her parents died,

25:23.965 --> 25:25.801
she was taken in
by her mother's best friend,

25:25.836 --> 25:27.758
who was a veterinarian
in Worcester.

25:27.852 --> 25:29.218
She got decent grades
in college,

25:29.285 --> 25:32.318
and interned at art galleries
in the summer.

25:32.385 --> 25:33.852
I think she's just like
anyone else.

25:33.919 --> 25:35.899
ASTRID: <i>Hey, guys?</i>
<i>I think I found something.</i>

25:36.241 --> 25:37.965
There's King Cobra chilis.

25:38.485 --> 25:40.485
Three Boston restaurants
imported them last year,

25:40.552 --> 25:42.057
and one private citizen.

25:42.118 --> 25:43.384
- Who?
- I don't know.

25:43.385 --> 25:45.751
He paid with a money order.
But we have an address.

25:45.786 --> 25:47.071
<i>It's an apartment</i>
<i>in Cambridge.</i>

25:47.619 --> 25:49.285
Well, can you give the address
to Broyles

25:49.352 --> 25:51.419
and get him to have
a back-up team standing by

25:51.454 --> 25:52.339
in case we need them?

25:52.374 --> 25:53.095
<i>Sure thing.</i>

25:58.285 --> 25:59.590
Taste this, please.

26:04.818 --> 26:06.406
No. That's what
I was afraid of.

26:06.719 --> 26:08.231
Wh-- What is that?

26:08.266 --> 26:10.750
French vanilla ice cream
and cough syrup.

26:10.785 --> 26:12.001
Well, no, no, you see--

26:12.285 --> 26:13.725
I suspect that this--

26:13.986 --> 26:16.163
The secret ingredient
is wild cherries,

26:16.198 --> 26:17.528
and I didn't have
any fresh cherries.

26:19.051 --> 26:21.958
Unless you'd make a trip
to the market.

26:22.327 --> 26:25.376
If I do, I am no longer
your taste tester.

26:25.385 --> 26:26.763
Ooh. Deal.

27:28.408 --> 27:30.333
[indistinct chatter]

27:43.218 --> 27:44.746
You got my message.

27:49.994 --> 27:52.625
I suspected that a likeness of
a nitrogen molecule

27:52.660 --> 27:54.014
would attract
your attention.

27:55.748 --> 27:57.497
Please don't take
my son.

28:03.018 --> 28:04.642
Your friend and I
had a deal.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.104
We had an arrangement.

28:11.177 --> 28:13.310
I know what I did
was wrong, but--

28:13.641 --> 28:15.644
That is not
why I contacted you.

28:17.051 --> 28:19.309
I need your help.

28:19.886 --> 28:20.874
My help?

28:25.230 --> 28:25.722
Well.

28:27.056 --> 28:29.132
In that case,
I should call him.

28:30.321 --> 28:31.682
And Agent Dunham.

28:32.245 --> 28:33.926
They'll want to know
I'm talking to you.

28:34.467 --> 28:37.982
I suspect that they might be
occupied right now.

29:41.952 --> 29:42.939
Take it easy.

29:44.099 --> 29:45.452
Take it easy.

29:47.152 --> 29:48.382
Take it easy.

30:06.536 --> 30:07.411
[indistinct chatter]

30:07.480 --> 30:09.527
What is it that requires
my help?

30:12.358 --> 30:15.035
I have interfered
in the natural course of events.

30:16.426 --> 30:17.273
To correct that,

30:18.058 --> 30:21.213
the others will try to kill
Christine Hollis

30:21.863 --> 30:23.099
until they succeed.

30:24.495 --> 30:26.772
If we run,
they will find us.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.258
If I stop the assassin,
they will send another.

30:31.525 --> 30:34.083
I cannot see any course
of action

30:34.591 --> 30:38.948
that will prevent...
her death.

30:40.819 --> 30:42.357
What makes you think
I can help?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.739
Because you have solved
such a matter before.

30:45.725 --> 30:48.720
You saw beyond the limitations
of your problems.

30:49.583 --> 30:50.276
Not really.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.342
I just missed my son.

30:56.825 --> 31:00.816
May I ask what is so important
about Miss Hollis?

31:04.458 --> 31:06.609
I cannot explain
the reason.

31:08.058 --> 31:09.760
I merely see it.

31:11.816 --> 31:14.225
I have never experienced
such...

31:15.673 --> 31:16.881
certainty.

31:18.261 --> 31:19.318
But the others,

31:19.758 --> 31:21.486
they say she is
of no consequence.

31:23.525 --> 31:26.852
Well, in that case,
if you cannot persuade

31:26.887 --> 31:28.519
the others of
your conviction,

31:29.192 --> 31:31.204
then you must do something
to prove it.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.885
You must make her
important.

31:38.159 --> 31:40.068
And of course
whatever you do,

31:41.259 --> 31:44.574
you must be prepared
to face the consequences.

31:51.407 --> 31:52.549
The gunman leave
a trail?

31:53.125 --> 31:53.974
No.

31:54.517 --> 31:56.252
I called in his description
to the P.D.,

31:56.287 --> 31:57.660
but I expect he's long gone
by now.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.100
Broyles is sending in
a CSU team

32:00.135 --> 32:01.624
to dust this place
for fingerprints.

32:02.092 --> 32:04.246
Well, I doubt he's gonna
show up on any databases.

32:04.458 --> 32:05.993
At least none from
this century.

32:07.290 --> 32:07.883
What do you mean?

32:08.245 --> 32:10.046
What that guy Brandon said
about them being around

32:10.081 --> 32:12.478
for a long time,
1884?

32:13.241 --> 32:14.834
Apparently, it was a great year
for blubber.

32:34.905 --> 32:35.571
<i>What?</i>

32:36.525 --> 32:37.359
What is it?

32:46.958 --> 32:48.073
Do you...

32:49.391 --> 32:51.332
trust me?

32:57.159 --> 32:58.348
Yes.

33:03.025 --> 33:06.710
Then you must do
exactly...

33:08.725 --> 33:09.901
as I say.

33:11.838 --> 33:13.406
AGENT: <i>So far, we just pulled</i>
<i>two off the door.</i>

33:13.441 --> 33:14.995

33:16.691 --> 33:17.998
Any ideas?

33:19.339 --> 33:20.489
What are they looking for?

33:21.970 --> 33:22.778
<i>We're looking for them,</i>

33:22.813 --> 33:24.073
<i>but they're looking</i>
<i>for something too.</i>

33:24.897 --> 33:26.382
That's why they keep on
showing up.

33:26.417 --> 33:27.284
[cell phone rings]

33:27.691 --> 33:29.223
So what are
they looking for?

33:30.648 --> 33:31.270
Dunham.

33:32.792 --> 33:33.539
Where?

33:34.725 --> 33:36.069
Someone just called in
a description

33:36.119 --> 33:36.992
of our second Observer.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.764
He was spotted
at a motel in Lowell.

34:00.743 --> 34:02.179
[electronic whir]

34:40.174 --> 34:41.106
What are you doing?

34:41.973 --> 34:43.266
<i>Tell me</i>
<i>where she is.</i>

34:43.897 --> 34:45.331
Just tell me
where she is.

34:45.587 --> 34:47.297
You know I'm just trying
to do my job.

34:47.333 --> 34:48.530
<i>I have no quarrel</i>
<i>with you.</i>

34:52.353 --> 34:53.235
Are you insane?

Good-bye.

36:34.072 --> 36:34.986
Christine?

36:37.043 --> 36:38.099
Christine Hollis?

36:52.908 --> 36:53.663
Christine.

36:54.608 --> 36:56.241
I'm Agent Olivia Dunham.

36:56.519 --> 36:57.798
I'm with the FBI.

36:58.186 --> 36:59.209
It's gonna be
all right.

37:02.141 --> 37:05.851
What about the man?
The one who took me?

37:08.941 --> 37:10.145
Let's get you home.

37:19.208 --> 37:21.786
Will she be safe now?

37:24.255 --> 37:25.158
Who is she?

37:26.542 --> 37:28.459
Why did you save her?

37:32.153 --> 37:34.181
I saw her
many years ago.

37:35.408 --> 37:36.781
She was a child.

37:39.241 --> 37:41.286
Her parents had just
been killed.

37:43.442 --> 37:44.657
She was crying.

37:45.878 --> 37:46.883
But she...

37:48.848 --> 37:50.073
She was brave.

37:57.153 --> 37:59.455
She crossed my mind...

38:01.955 --> 38:02.999
somehow.

38:04.506 --> 38:05.848
She never left it.

38:11.908 --> 38:13.033
I think...

38:15.291 --> 38:16.958
It's what they call...

38:19.050 --> 38:20.081
feelings.

38:22.175 --> 38:23.630
I think...

38:26.208 --> 38:27.615
I love her.

38:36.941 --> 38:39.105
Will she be safe now?

38:41.110 --> 38:41.983
Yes.

38:44.575 --> 38:48.858
You made her important.

39:02.742 --> 39:06.782
She is responsible
for the death of one of us.

39:18.501 --> 39:19.686
CHRISTINE:
<i>So who was he?</i>

39:20.254 --> 39:22.459
How am I supposed
to make sense of any of this?

39:23.738 --> 39:25.081
Him, the plane,

39:25.845 --> 39:27.314
the guy who came
after us.

39:27.941 --> 39:29.948
Did he say
anything to you?

39:30.839 --> 39:31.415
Anything?

39:31.495 --> 39:34.596
Did he tell you
why he saved you?

39:35.342 --> 39:35.997
No.

39:36.974 --> 39:37.878
WALTER: <i>He...</i>

39:39.850 --> 39:42.077
He asked me
to give you something.

<i>he couldn't.</i>

playing skee-ball.

in the backseat

40:15.117 --> 40:16.492
when the bridge collapsed.

40:17.925 --> 40:18.901
Christine.

40:21.851 --> 40:23.551
I think
you'll be safe now.

40:25.267 --> 40:25.863
<i>Hmm?</i>

40:33.041 --> 40:34.705
When did you see
the Observer?

40:34.775 --> 40:36.117
And why didn't you
tell me?

40:38.419 --> 40:39.091
What do you mean?

40:42.308 --> 40:43.759
I just did tell you.

40:43.794 --> 40:46.070
No, that's not good enough.
We are so close.

40:46.105 --> 40:47.508
I can't let these guys
get away again.

40:47.858 --> 40:49.543
They have the answers.
I know they do.

40:50.241 --> 40:51.357
Don't worry, son.

40:52.812 --> 40:54.068
You will get your answer.

40:59.846 --> 41:02.870
Why don't we go for
a long drive together?

41:03.775 --> 41:06.912
Perhaps to pick up
a Tutti Frutti milkshake.

41:09.073 --> 41:10.179
BROYLES:
<i>The man you shot</i>

41:10.214 --> 41:11.526
was named Donald Long.

41:12.542 --> 41:14.874
Ballistics tied his gun
to six unsolved homicides

41:14.909 --> 41:15.899
up and down
the East Coast.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.771
The earliest one
dates back ten years.

41:17.806 --> 41:19.363
- An assassin.
- Maybe.

41:19.998 --> 41:21.615
Well, do we know
who hired him this time?

41:21.841 --> 41:22.657
We don't know.

41:22.874 --> 41:24.584
Nothing in his car
or on his person

41:24.619 --> 41:25.449
gave any indication.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.113
What about
the Observer's gun?

41:27.892 --> 41:29.618
Our techs had never seen
anything like it.

41:29.653 --> 41:30.721
They can't seem
to make it fire.

41:30.941 --> 41:33.209
The best we can figure,
Peter shot off the last round.

41:35.079 --> 41:36.077
There's one more thing.

41:37.175 --> 41:39.677
The tip-off that the Observer
was spotted at that motel,

41:40.908 --> 41:43.040
it was called in from
one of the motel phones.

41:44.908 --> 41:47.251
What if he was trying
to protect Christine?

41:48.241 --> 41:51.364
And if he realized
he couldn't do it on his own?

41:51.399 --> 41:53.461
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

41:58.542 --> 42:00.033
If it's okay with you,

42:00.068 --> 42:02.422
I--I'd like to take
the rest of the day off.

42:04.508 --> 42:05.291
Sure.

42:06.974 --> 42:07.919
Big plans?

42:08.877 --> 42:09.564
Yeah.

42:11.499 --> 42:12.864
Don't worry, Aunt Liv.

42:12.899 --> 42:15.292
I'll hold your hand.
[giggles]

42:16.030 --> 42:17.194
You'd better.

42:19.475 --> 42:22.442
Oh, I'm not gonna--
No, no, no, no!

[giggling]

42:45.445 --> 42:47.329
Look how happy she is.

42:48.635 --> 42:51.895
It's a shame things are about
to get so hard for her.
