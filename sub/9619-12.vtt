02:40.093 --> 02:41.794
{\an1}IT'S NOT MY TURN TO PAY.

02:41.861 --> 02:42.929
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, WHOSE TURN IS IT?

02:42.996 --> 02:43.396

{\an1}AND I DIDN'T EVEN

02:50.570 --> 02:51.271
{\an1}PUT BUTTER ON IT.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.372
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, CALM DOWN

02:52.438 --> 02:54.207

05:56.823 --> 05:57.824
{\an1}APPARENTLY YOU GET TO BUY

05:57.890 --> 05:58.891
{\an1}WHATEVER YOU WANT

05:58.958 --> 06:00.359
{\an1}AND THE COMPANY PAYS FOR IT.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.227
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M GONNA HAVE TO

06:01.294 --> 06:04.163
{\an1}SIT DOWN FOR THIS.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.364
{\an1}ANYTHING?

06:05.431 --> 06:05.932

06:10.303 --> 06:11.771
{\an1}NO ONE EVEN LOOKED AT IT.

06:11.838 --> 06:12.705
{\an1}IF A WAITER GAVE MY DAD

06:12.772 --> 06:13.906
{\an1}THAT BILL, HE WOULD'VE CHASED

06:13.973 --> 06:16.542
{\an1}HIM AROUND THE RESTAURANT.

06:16.609 --> 06:17.677
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WOW! IF I COULD BUY

06:17.744 --> 06:18.478
{\an1}ANYTHING IN THE WORLD,

{\an1}THERE'S AN EMPTINESS INSIDE

12:27.179 --> 12:27.847
{\an1}THAT CAN ONLY BE FILLED

12:27.913 --> 12:31.250
{\an1}BY $27 CRAB CAKES,

12:31.317 --> 12:33.486
{\an1}SO LET'S EAT.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.855
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, NO. THE RESTAURANT.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.990
{\an1}WE SPENT A BUNCH OF MONEY THERE.

12:38.057 --> 12:38.390
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO?

12:38.457 --> 12:39.458
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO IT'S GONNA SHOW UP

12:39.525 --> 12:40.426

12:40.493 --> 12:41.327
{\an1}WE CAN'T RETURN FOOD

12:41.393 --> 12:42.561
{\an1}WE'VE ALREADY EATEN.

12:42.628 --> 12:46.398
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE CAN. DARE ME?

12:46.465 --> 12:47.066

12:47.133 --> 12:47.800
{\an1}THAT MONEY BACK,

12:47.867 --> 12:50.469
{\an1}OR I'M IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

12:50.536 --> 12:51.637
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

12:51.704 --> 12:52.304
{\an1}YOU KNOW ALL THOSE MODELS

12:52.371 --> 12:53.172
{\an1}THAT COME THROUGH HERE?

12:53.239 --> 12:54.106
{\an1}LET'S PICK THE THREE PRETTIEST

12:54.173 --> 12:55.441
{\an1}AND CHARGE THEM 100 BUCKS EACH

12:55.508 --> 12:56.275
{\an1}TO HUG ME.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.011
{\an1}HEAR ME OUT. HEAR ME OUT.

12:59.078 --> 12:59.612
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW. WE CAN HAVE

12:59.678 --> 13:00.713
{\an1}AN OFFICE GARAGE SALE.

13:00.779 --> 13:01.914
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU, WE'RE NOT GONNA--

13:01.981 --> 13:05.818
{\an1}WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S NOT

13:05.885 --> 13:07.453
{\an1}A COMPLETELY TERRIBLE IDEA.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.754
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

13:08.821 --> 13:09.889
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AT MY FIRST LUNCH,

13:09.955 --> 13:10.756
{\an1}HIBBERT SAID SOMETHING

13:10.823 --> 13:11.690
{\an1}ABOUT MR. MADIGAN

13:11.757 --> 13:12.691
{\an1}THROWING OUT HIS OLD FURNITURE.

13:12.758 --> 13:13.526
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND BEFORE HE DOES,

13:13.592 --> 13:14.860
{\an1}WE LOOK UNDER HIS COUCH CUSHION

13:14.927 --> 13:16.128
{\an1}FOR OLD $1,000 BILLS?

13:16.195 --> 13:16.762
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.130
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.532
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE SELL THE FURNITURE

13:19.598 --> 13:20.566
{\an1}TO PAY FOR OUR LUNCH.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.133
{\an1}I MEAN, HE'S JUST

13:21.200 --> 13:22.201
{\an1}THROWING IT OUT.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.770
{\an1}AND THAT STUFF IS PRETTY NICE.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.405
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TOTALLY NICE.

13:26.472 --> 13:26.906
{\an1}SITTING ON THOSE

13:26.972 --> 13:28.774
{\an1}BIG BROWN CHAIRS FEELS EXACTLY

13:28.841 --> 13:29.408
{\an1}LIKE GETTING A HUG

13:29.475 --> 13:32.144
{\an1}FROM A FRIENDLY BEAR.

13:32.211 --> 13:32.678
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW

13:32.745 --> 13:33.212
{\an1}WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

13:33.279 --> 13:35.314
{\an1}TO BE HUGGED BY A BEAR?

13:35.381 --> 13:35.981
{\an1}&gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE FIELD TRIP

13:36.048 --> 13:36.949
{\an1}TO THE ZOO?

13:37.016 --> 13:37.483
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHERE YOU TRIED

13:37.550 --> 13:38.551
{\an1}TO KISS THE KANGAROO?

13:38.617 --> 13:39.852
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, THE ONE BEFORE THAT.

13:39.919 --> 13:40.586
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, WHEN YOU PUT THE TURTLE

13:40.653 --> 13:41.053
{\an1}ON YOUR HEAD?

13:41.120 --> 13:41.420
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GUYS.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.556
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SORRY.

13:43.622 --> 13:44.256
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO FIND SOMEBODY

13:44.323 --> 13:45.791
{\an1}TO BUY THAT FURNITURE RIGHT AWAY

13:45.858 --> 13:47.326
{\an1}AND BEFORE THAT ACCOUNTANT

13:47.393 --> 13:48.861
{\an1}HUNTS ME DOWN, STABS ME,

13:48.928 --> 13:50.696
{\an1}AND PUTS ME ON HER WALL.

13:50.763 --> 13:51.830
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MY UNCLE KNOWS A GUY

13:51.897 --> 13:53.499
{\an1}WHO'S ALWAYS BUYING JUNK.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.133
{\an1}I BET HE'LL TAKE IT

13:54.200 --> 13:55.100
{\an1}OFF OUR HANDS.

13:55.167 --> 13:55.801
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW,

13:55.868 --> 13:58.103
{\an1}THAT SOUNDS KIND OF SHIFTY.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.705
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S HIS NAME.

13:59.772 --> 14:07.012
{\an1}WHAT, YOU KNOW HIM?

14:07.079 --> 14:08.347
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANKS, SHIFTY.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.381
{\an1}SAY HI TO UNCLE SKETCH

14:09.448 --> 14:12.484
{\an1}IF YOU SEE HIM.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.220
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE, THERE YOU ARE.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.521
{\an1}ROSE PINCHBINDER IS STILL

14:15.588 --> 14:16.288
{\an1}ON YOUR TRAIL.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.089
{\an1}I CAN'T HOLD HER OFF

14:17.156 --> 14:18.057
{\an1}MUCH LONGER.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.391
{\an1}SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE COULD

14:19.458 --> 14:20.726
{\an1}SMELL LIES AND THEN SHE STARTED

14:20.793 --> 14:22.728
{\an1}SNIFFING MY HEAD.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.163
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANKS, OSCAR, BUT HOPEFULLY

14:24.230 --> 14:26.265
{\an1}THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.032
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHERE'S MR. MADIGAN'S

14:27.099 --> 14:27.800

{\an1}&gt;&gt; I SOLD IT TO PAY OFF

14:29.268 --> 14:30.469
{\an1}THE COMPANY CREDIT CARD.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.937
{\an1}PRETTY SMART, HUH?

14:32.004 --> 14:33.172
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT FURNITURE WAS RENTED.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.608
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT WAS RENTED?

14:35.674 --> 14:36.976
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN EXCHANGES IT

14:37.042 --> 14:39.311
{\an1}EVERY YEAR FOR A NEW SET.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.679
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME

14:40.746 --> 14:41.413
{\an1}FOR ONE OF YOUR

14:41.480 --> 14:43.349
{\an1}NOT TERRIBLE IDEAS.

14:43.415 --> 14:43.849
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE COULD RUN

14:43.916 --> 14:45.050
{\an1}AND NEVER LOOK BACK.

14:45.117 --> 14:45.784
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD,

14:45.851 --> 14:47.519

15:26.325 --> 15:26.825
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE LIKE TO READ.

15:26.892 --> 15:27.593
{\an1}THAT'S WHY WE'RE STANDING

15:27.660 --> 15:29.595
{\an1}NEXT TO THIS LAMP.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.731
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT LAMP ISN'T EVEN ON.

15:32.798 --> 15:33.565
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CLICK.

15:33.632 --> 15:36.101

15:48.047 --> 15:48.981
{\an1}I'M STUCK IN QUICKSAND

15:49.048 --> 15:50.616

15:50.683 --> 15:51.350
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY, TRUE.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.085

16:18.877 --> 16:19.578
{\an1}EVEN WORSE THAN THE TIME AMANDA

16:19.645 --> 16:21.613
{\an1}REPLACED ALL MY SOUR CANDY

{\an1}IN A SENTENCE.
