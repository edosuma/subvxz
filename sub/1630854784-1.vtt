06:09.161 --> 06:10.922

See the sea lions?

Some of them have cancer,

giving the sea lions cancer?

It's harming the marine life.

06:25.799 --> 06:27.076
- How?

climate change.

away

and sugary drinks.

did when they filmed Vertigo?

15:04.041 --> 15:06.043

me

15:14.396 --> 15:15.880
to San Juan Bautista to find
out.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.365

17:20.177 --> 17:23.525

No fossil fuels.

17:43.821 --> 17:47.204
- Protect our children, and let
them see a sky that is blue,

17:47.238 --> 17:49.516
and not orange from the
wildfire.

17:49.551 --> 17:53.589
This is climate change.
- No mass extinction.

[dramatic music]

18:50.750 --> 18:53.477
[waves crashing]

19:27.856 --> 19:29.029
- That's wonderful.

19:29.064 --> 19:31.031
Kinda reminds me of a Van Gogh
painting.

19:35.829 --> 19:37.176
- Thanks, I love to paint.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.936
Van Gogh is my inspiration.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.042
I have to capture the beauty of
this place

19:42.111 --> 19:43.182
before it's all gone.

19:44.390 --> 19:45.701
- Why do you say that?

19:45.736 --> 19:47.807
- Remember last year, when the
sky turned

19:47.841 --> 19:51.397
from blue to orange, because
of all the wildfires?

19:51.466 --> 19:53.433
I don't want to paint the orange
sky.

19:54.814 --> 19:56.367
- What kind of bird is it?

19:56.402 --> 19:57.886
- It's a sea eagle.

19:58.818 --> 20:00.820
- I didn't know there were
sea eagles in this area.

20:00.854 --> 20:04.203
- They're from Southeast
Asia, Vietnam, and Australia.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.481
At least, that's what Dr. Jones
said.

20:06.515 --> 20:07.999
- Who's Dr. Jones?

20:08.034 --> 20:10.864
- He's a bird expert and
ornithologist.

20:12.038 --> 20:15.869
He was here to study why the sea
eagles

20:15.904 --> 20:18.147
have come to Santa Cruz,

20:18.182 --> 20:20.184
and he pointed to a flock of sea
eagles,

20:20.219 --> 20:21.530
and they looked magnificent,

20:21.565 --> 20:23.394
so I decided to paint the sea
eagles.

20:25.914 --> 20:26.915
He was a little worried, though,

20:26.915 --> 20:28.710
about the sea eagles being in
Santa Cruz,

20:28.744 --> 20:32.679
'cause in 2008, a flock of
golden eagles

20:32.714 --> 20:35.026
had attacked a small
town of Half Moon Bay.

20:35.993 --> 20:37.236
- No way, did he say why?

20:38.202 --> 20:38.996
- No, he didn't.

20:39.030 --> 20:39.893
He didn't say why.

[underwater splashing]

21:02.537 --> 21:04.228
[waves crashing]

21:04.263 --> 21:05.505
- Shark, shark!

21:07.887 --> 21:08.957
Shark!

21:11.235 --> 21:13.064
- Are you okay?

21:13.099 --> 21:15.135
- God, no, no, a shark
just bit off my hand, man.

21:15.204 --> 21:16.309
It nearly bit it off!

21:16.378 --> 21:18.863
- Are you injured, do we need to
call 911?

21:18.898 --> 21:20.071
- No.

21:20.106 --> 21:21.935
No, no need to call an
ambulance.

21:23.212 --> 21:24.559
- Sharks though?

21:24.593 --> 21:25.905
- Yes.

21:25.939 --> 21:27.941
Well, okay, a few years ago,

21:27.976 --> 21:29.288
it was very rare to find sharks

21:29.322 --> 21:30.737
in the Santa Cruz ocean, right?

21:30.772 --> 21:32.946
Okay, but now 'cause of global
warming, and climate change,

21:32.981 --> 21:36.812
you know, the sea warmed
and now they're out there.

21:36.847 --> 21:38.193
But now it's like every time I
surf,

21:38.262 --> 21:40.126
it's like I'm playing
Russian roulette with sharks.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.852
- That's awful!

21:41.921 --> 21:43.578
- Yeah, it's like I'm
seriously considering

21:43.612 --> 21:45.338
quitting surfing, it's just,

21:45.407 --> 21:46.822
it's too dangerous, you know?

21:47.685 --> 21:48.617
[surfer sighs]

21:48.652 --> 21:49.653
All right, guys.

21:49.687 --> 21:50.999
Stay safe, okay?

21:51.068 --> 21:53.795
[waves crashing]

22:15.955 --> 22:17.094
- Nice house.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.130
- Thanks, I sell houses.

22:19.165 --> 22:19.993
I'm an agent.

22:20.028 --> 22:20.891
- Really?

22:20.960 --> 22:23.307
I'm actually looking to buy a
house.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.103
- Okay, in that case,
let me give you my card.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.484
- Thank you.

22:27.518 --> 22:29.831
Million Dollar House Realty.

22:29.865 --> 22:31.902
Are all the houses you sell
really valued

22:31.971 --> 22:33.559
at at least a million dollars?

22:33.628 --> 22:35.975
- Absolutely, the price of
houses

22:36.009 --> 22:37.839
are going through the roof.

22:37.873 --> 22:40.704
Even the price of a condo costs
more than a million dollars

22:40.738 --> 22:42.982
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

22:43.016 --> 22:46.330
- Wow, well I'm looking
for a three bedroom home,

22:46.365 --> 22:49.368
surrounded by trees,
preferably in a forest.

22:52.612 --> 22:53.441
- Okay.

22:54.338 --> 22:55.822
Are you sure you really want a
house

22:55.857 --> 22:58.722
that's surrounded by trees in
the forest?

22:58.756 --> 22:59.999
- Yeah, what's wrong with trees?

23:00.033 --> 23:02.829
- Trees absorb CO2, they're
good for the environment.

23:04.106 --> 23:07.834
- Well, usually I just find
that dream house for my clients.

23:07.869 --> 23:10.216
I'm not obligated beyond that,

23:10.250 --> 23:11.907
and I mind my own business,

23:11.942 --> 23:14.979
and I collect my big fat sales
commission.

23:15.014 --> 23:18.431
[realtor chuckles]

23:18.500 --> 23:21.779
But you look like a
nice guy, a nice couple,

23:21.848 --> 23:25.127
so I'm gonna give you some
advice to help save your house.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.267
Remember that small town called
Paradise

23:27.302 --> 23:29.442
where a wildfire came
through and burned down

23:29.477 --> 23:32.238
the whole city, and all the
houses, a few years ago?

23:32.272 --> 23:33.550
- Yes.

23:33.584 --> 23:37.588
- Well, that town was and is
surrounded by trees and forest.

23:37.623 --> 23:41.868
Then the wildfire came, and
burned down all the houses.

23:41.903 --> 23:43.870
The trees were so dry
they were ready to burn

23:43.905 --> 23:46.079
like matchsticks or firewood.

23:46.114 --> 23:48.047
And then they were all gone.

23:48.081 --> 23:49.497
- Why were the trees so dry?

23:50.567 --> 23:52.603
- Global warming, climate
change.

23:53.984 --> 23:56.642
It's screwing up real estate
business.

23:56.711 --> 23:58.954
It's screwing up the whole
planet.

23:59.023 --> 23:59.852
- It's awful.

24:01.716 --> 24:04.443
[pleasant music]

24:35.404 --> 24:37.924
See with Rejuvenate,
you could look younger,

24:37.959 --> 24:40.479
be younger, and live longer,

24:40.513 --> 24:43.240
because Rejuvenate restores
cells,

24:43.274 --> 24:45.967
and also repairs damaged cells.

24:46.001 --> 24:49.626
Even more so, Rejuvenate really
slows down

24:49.660 --> 24:51.351
those nine mechanisms of aging.

24:52.318 --> 24:54.320
- Yes, absolutely.

24:54.354 --> 24:56.598
I could sure use some
Rejuvenate.

24:56.633 --> 24:58.669
After all, I'm not getting any
younger,

24:58.704 --> 25:01.154
and I'd like to get
some for my mother, too,

25:01.189 --> 25:02.915
because she suffers from
arthritis.

25:04.779 --> 25:05.987
- Well, we could definitely do
that.

25:06.021 --> 25:07.471
That would be great.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.060
- So, Evan tell me, what kind of
money

25:10.129 --> 25:11.371
are we talking about here?

25:12.407 --> 25:16.204
- So, we are talking
about roughly $10 million.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.760
- 10 mil [whistles] well,
that's a lot of moolah.

25:21.623 --> 25:24.108
But like I said, I'm
not getting any younger,

25:24.143 --> 25:26.145
and neither is my mother.

25:26.179 --> 25:29.458
But anyway, the world
needs Rejuvenate now,

25:29.493 --> 25:30.977
so you got it, man.

25:31.012 --> 25:32.703
You're gonna get your 10 mil.

25:32.738 --> 25:34.671
[upbeat music]

25:34.705 --> 25:35.603
- Fantastic!

25:37.052 --> 25:38.847
Yes, yes, yes!

25:38.882 --> 25:40.124
Thank you, sir.

25:40.159 --> 25:42.230
- Congratulations.

25:42.299 --> 25:44.335
You're the man.
- Yes, sir.

25:44.370 --> 25:46.510
- Yep, we're going to do
some great work together.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.615
- Yes we are.

25:49.030 --> 25:50.549
- So, you take care.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.653
I'll talk to you soon.

25:51.688 --> 25:54.863
- Talk to you soon, sir.
- Okay, bye-bye.

26:40.012 --> 26:41.703
- Very nice car.

26:41.738 --> 26:43.636
- Thank you, I just got it,

26:43.705 --> 26:46.397
directly from the
Ferrari factory in Italy.

26:46.432 --> 26:47.260
- Very nice.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.511
- I really think you're
gonna like this house.

26:56.580 --> 27:01.585
It's 5,000 square feet,
three bedrooms, three baths.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.138
It's listed for $2.1 million.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.141
- You know, I like it.

27:06.176 --> 27:08.143
But there's two small trees out
front.

27:11.353 --> 27:12.941
And weren't you just telling
me I shouldn't get a house

27:12.976 --> 27:15.910
surrounded by trees, because
of wildfire and global warming?

27:15.944 --> 27:17.290
- Yes, I know.

27:17.325 --> 27:19.327
But come on, these two small
trees,

27:19.361 --> 27:22.088
they're not gonna burn down this
house.

27:22.123 --> 27:23.400
Come on, let's go inside.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.505
Let's take a look.
- Okay.

27:25.574 --> 27:28.301
[birds chirping]

27:40.693 --> 27:42.833
- Okay, here we have the main
living room.

27:42.868 --> 27:46.768
As you can see, plenty of
windows and natural lighting.

27:50.220 --> 27:52.015
- This is a very unique
painting.

27:52.084 --> 27:53.672
- Yes it is.

27:53.706 --> 27:56.053
It's called "Orange Sky."

27:56.122 --> 27:59.125
It was inspired by the
wildfires from last year,

27:59.160 --> 28:03.060
which turned this color of
the sky from blue to orange.

28:03.129 --> 28:06.857
The owner, seller of this
house is a climate scientist.

28:06.892 --> 28:10.861
He was so shocked to see the
color of the sky turn orange

28:10.896 --> 28:12.829
that he had this painting
commissioned.

28:13.795 --> 28:15.348
- The orange sky looks like
hell.

28:15.383 --> 28:16.211
- Agreed.

28:17.799 --> 28:21.009
Over here, this painting
is called "Burning Tree."

28:22.424 --> 28:26.049
Wildfires burned hundreds
of millions of trees,

28:26.083 --> 28:30.018
releasing even more CO2
into the atmosphere.

28:30.053 --> 28:30.985
- So tragic.

28:31.882 --> 28:32.711
- Yeah.

28:38.682 --> 28:41.858
This painting here is
called "Melting Ice,"

28:41.892 --> 28:45.240
which depicts melting ice in
the Arctic, and Antarctica,

28:45.275 --> 28:47.104
due to global warming.

28:47.173 --> 28:51.384
The owner told me that the ice
in the Arctic and Antarctica

28:51.419 --> 28:54.698
serve as the Earth's
natural air conditioners.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.390
The ice helps to keep
the planet Earth cool,

28:57.425 --> 28:59.013
and at a normal temperature.

29:00.566 --> 29:01.843
He said that when the ice

29:01.878 --> 29:04.535
is all gone and melted, we're
toast.

29:11.922 --> 29:14.511
[somber music]

29:22.968 --> 29:26.040
[whale spout hisses]

29:38.707 --> 29:43.712
[gulls cawing]
[whale spout hisses]

30:26.859 --> 30:28.102
- Wow.

30:28.136 --> 30:28.930
- Yeah.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.760
This whale at the ripe old age
of 50,

30:31.795 --> 30:33.832
died from natural causes.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.972
It's too bad today's whales
won't live that long.

30:36.006 --> 30:38.837
They're gonna die of cancer
due to ocean acidification.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.460
[gentle music]

30:53.955 --> 30:56.682
[birds chirping]

30:58.546 --> 30:59.892
- Hi.

30:59.961 --> 31:00.789
- Hello.
- Hi.

31:02.653 --> 31:05.070
- Awesome looking whale
skeleton.

31:05.139 --> 31:05.933
- Yeah.

31:08.349 --> 31:09.798
- I think I know who you are.

31:10.696 --> 31:14.424
You are Mr. Green, founder of
Pay Me,

31:14.493 --> 31:17.806
Odyssey Space Line, and
the Green Car Company.

31:18.980 --> 31:20.879
You're like the richest man in
the world.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.052
- Yes, it's me.

31:22.984 --> 31:25.711
- You know, I love my Tesla
Model 3,

31:25.745 --> 31:29.163
but my next car definitely
has to be the Green E,

31:30.233 --> 31:32.683
because it's fast, it looks
great,

31:32.718 --> 31:36.860
and it has twice the mileage
range as a Tesla Model 3,

31:36.895 --> 31:39.276
and it's only $20,000.

31:39.345 --> 31:40.657
- Hope you get a Green car.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.692
- [Evan] Definitely.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.834
- Well, we'd better fix global
warming,

31:45.869 --> 31:47.077
or else the human race will wind
up

31:47.112 --> 31:48.354
like this whale skeleton.

31:49.355 --> 31:50.218
- I completely agree,

31:50.287 --> 31:53.049
but how are we gonna fix global
warming?

31:53.083 --> 31:56.052
- It's a good question,
and I think I can fix it.

31:57.122 --> 31:59.883
Even if there was zero CO2
emissions now,

31:59.918 --> 32:02.610
in every country, the whole
planet?

32:02.644 --> 32:04.543
It will not solve global
warming,

32:04.577 --> 32:08.443
because, since the industrial
revolution over 100 years ago,

32:08.478 --> 32:11.688
over 1,000 gigatons of
CO2 has been released

32:11.722 --> 32:13.483
into the Earth's atmosphere.

32:13.552 --> 32:15.105
This massive amount of CO2

32:15.140 --> 32:17.142
will continue to raise
Earth's temperatures

32:17.211 --> 32:19.420
with all the harms of global
warming.

32:20.766 --> 32:23.942
We are at a point now, according
to a United Nations report,

32:25.046 --> 32:27.911
it's code red for
humanity and civilization.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.085
- It's so tragic.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.466
- So that's why I started a
company

32:31.501 --> 32:34.953
called Code Red Technology,
to fix global warming.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.920
I'm funding it with a few
billion dollars

32:36.955 --> 32:40.234
to build a space elevator
that goes from the ground

32:40.268 --> 32:43.513
to the Earth's atmosphere, about
62 miles.

32:43.582 --> 32:46.447
This space elevator is
a large tube and cable

32:46.481 --> 32:49.588
that is built from graphene
carbon nanotechnology material.

32:49.622 --> 32:52.660
That's very strong,
can withstand anything.

32:52.694 --> 32:54.662
My Code Red space elevator will
be used

32:54.696 --> 32:57.906
to transport cargo, and people,
to space.

32:57.941 --> 33:00.150
Hey, I'm gonna disrupt the space
business

33:00.185 --> 33:02.083
by making it cheap, and
affordable

33:02.118 --> 33:04.465
to travel and access space for
everyone.

33:04.499 --> 33:07.778
And, it will be used to pump the
CO2

33:07.813 --> 33:09.780
out of the Earth's atmosphere.

33:09.815 --> 33:10.816
Here's how it works.

33:12.093 --> 33:13.992
My Code Red space elevator

33:14.026 --> 33:17.512
removes the CO2 out of
the Earth's atmosphere,

33:17.581 --> 33:19.031
and sends it into space.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.653
Global warming is fixed.

33:20.688 --> 33:22.172
- That's incredible.

33:22.207 --> 33:23.587
- Hm, yes.

33:23.622 --> 33:24.968
And Mr. Green?

33:25.003 --> 33:28.972
If you're successful with
this Code Red space elevator,

33:29.007 --> 33:30.870
you're not only gonna be a
trillionaire,

33:30.939 --> 33:33.011
and win a Nobel Prize,

33:33.045 --> 33:36.704
but you will have done a
great thing for humanity.

33:36.773 --> 33:38.326
- Thank you.

33:38.361 --> 33:41.364
Even if my space elevator
does not remove enough CO2

33:41.398 --> 33:42.641
out of the Earth's atmosphere,

33:42.675 --> 33:44.712
and the planet goes up in smoke,

33:44.746 --> 33:48.405
my space elevator will transport
the human race into space,

33:48.474 --> 33:51.995
where there will be colonies
in space near Earth's orbit,

33:52.030 --> 33:55.240
the moon, Mars, and beyond.

33:55.309 --> 33:58.036

[soothing music]

35:54.635 --> 35:57.396
[birds chirping]

35:59.087 --> 36:01.228
- Hello, here's your wine.

36:03.264 --> 36:05.818
- Did you know that this
was the vacation home

36:05.853 --> 36:08.959
for the great director,
Mr. Alfred Hitchcock?

36:08.994 --> 36:11.307
And it was here where he was
inspired

36:11.341 --> 36:13.999
to make his films, "The
Birds" and "Vertigo?"

36:14.931 --> 36:15.794
- Really?

36:15.863 --> 36:19.107
- Yes, and in 1961 a flock of
seagulls

36:19.142 --> 36:21.179
attacked a group of people in
Santa Cruz,

36:21.213 --> 36:23.215
and it was reported in a local
newspaper,

36:23.284 --> 36:25.321
"The Santa Cruz Sentinel."

36:25.355 --> 36:27.978
Well, Mr. Hitchcock read that
article,

36:28.013 --> 36:32.362
and it inspired him to produce
and direct "The Birds."

36:33.467 --> 36:34.847
- Interesting, I didn't know
that.

36:34.882 --> 36:37.885
- Yes, it was also here
where he was inspired

36:37.919 --> 36:41.026
to film in locations like San
Francisco,

36:41.060 --> 36:42.924
and San Juan Bautista,

36:42.993 --> 36:46.376
where he filmed his
greatest movie, "Vertigo."

36:46.411 --> 36:48.551
- It's actually not just
Hitchcock's greatest movie.

36:48.585 --> 36:50.208
According to a 2012 survey

36:50.242 --> 36:52.417
by the influential "Sight
and Sound" magazine,

36:52.486 --> 36:54.936
the film industry, movie
critics, and academics

36:55.005 --> 36:56.973
voted "Vertigo" the
greatest film of all time,

36:57.007 --> 36:58.802
surpassing "Citizen Kane."

36:58.837 --> 36:59.665
- Wow.

37:04.636 --> 37:07.363
[rain pattering]

37:12.713 --> 37:15.474
[birds chirping]

37:17.131 --> 37:19.271
They look like they're
having a lot of fun.

37:19.340 --> 37:20.168
- Yeah.

37:22.170 --> 37:25.070
[zipline whirring]

37:30.317 --> 37:34.010
- They're standing, walking,
and flying with the trees,

37:34.044 --> 37:35.529
before the trees are all gone.

37:39.740 --> 37:42.674
[zipline whirring]

37:47.989 --> 37:51.061
- Last week, birds,
specifically the sea eagle,

37:51.096 --> 37:54.064
was seen at the Santa
Cruz beach boardwalk.

37:54.099 --> 37:56.964
Local residents and tourists
were concerned for their safety

37:56.998 --> 37:59.449
as the sea eagle flew too
close to the boardwalk.

38:00.485 --> 38:02.728
Scientists are researching
just how the sea eagle

38:02.763 --> 38:05.800
came to Santa Cruz from
Southeast Asia,

38:05.835 --> 38:07.733
Vietnam, and Australia.

38:10.805 --> 38:14.257
Cal Fire has reported
20 wild fires this year.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.778
They also predict to have 10
more by the end of the year.

38:17.812 --> 38:20.298
They have also stated that
they are out of funding.

38:22.990 --> 38:25.579
In other news, Dr. Richard
McLoughlin,

38:25.613 --> 38:27.650
a climate scientist from San
Francisco,

38:27.684 --> 38:30.929
has given a dire warning
about climate change.

38:30.963 --> 38:32.517
He predicts the human race is
headed

38:32.586 --> 38:34.519
toward abrupt mass extinction,

38:34.588 --> 38:37.315
and the world and civilization
will end in just a few years,

38:37.349 --> 38:39.834
because the industrial
civilization

38:39.869 --> 38:42.630
has heated the planet Earth
to the point of extinction.

38:46.772 --> 38:49.499
[pleasant music]

39:22.843 --> 39:23.844
- Here's your beer.

39:23.878 --> 39:25.811
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

39:25.846 --> 39:28.227
- Hey, mister.
- Yes.

39:28.262 --> 39:31.576
- I remember this bus
used to be on that side.

39:31.645 --> 39:33.992
- You're right, it was on that
side.

39:34.026 --> 39:35.994
[birds chirping]

39:36.028 --> 39:38.824
But of course, that was
before the big bird attack,

39:38.859 --> 39:41.827
which came in, destroyed
the bus and my business.

39:41.862 --> 39:43.139
It was a terrible day.

39:43.173 --> 39:46.418
Sadly, many people died that
day.

39:46.487 --> 39:47.902
- The birds attacked?

39:47.971 --> 39:49.835
- Yeah, eagles.

39:49.870 --> 39:52.355
Eagles, they came by and
just crashed into everything.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.046
It was a terrible day.

39:54.081 --> 39:55.254
I'm a little nervous though,

39:55.289 --> 39:58.326
because lately I've seen
eagles hovering above the pub,

39:58.361 --> 40:00.225
and all over the Half Moon Bay
area.

40:05.713 --> 40:08.406
[dramatic music]

41:12.504 --> 41:15.265
[birds chirping]

41:24.516 --> 41:27.174
- James Stewart should
have never let Kim Novak

41:27.208 --> 41:29.763
run to the tower and fall
to her death in "Vertigo."

41:30.902 --> 41:32.455
- What tower?

41:32.490 --> 41:35.251
[birds chirping]

41:37.425 --> 41:38.357
- There's no tower.

41:39.842 --> 41:40.739
- Well, now you know.

41:40.808 --> 41:43.673
The tower was all a Hollywood
invention.

41:49.472 --> 41:52.199
[dramatic music]

42:25.646 --> 42:27.130
I'm not very good at this,

42:27.165 --> 42:28.925
and it might sound cliche,

42:28.994 --> 42:30.927
but ever since I met you, Kim,

42:30.996 --> 42:33.412
it feels like my life has been
uplifted.

42:34.724 --> 42:35.725
- That's wonderful.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.831
I'm glad I can have a
positive effect on you.

42:37.865 --> 42:40.247
- Yeah, I feel excited.

42:40.316 --> 42:42.318
I feel energetic.

42:42.352 --> 42:44.078
I even feel optimistic.

42:44.113 --> 42:45.908
I feel like I can do anything,

42:45.942 --> 42:47.737
like doing the impossible.

42:47.772 --> 42:48.773
- Like what?

42:48.842 --> 42:50.222
- Like just last week,

42:50.257 --> 42:53.398
I successfully raised
$10 million in funding

42:53.432 --> 42:56.228
for my biotech startup,
Immortal Therapeutics.

42:56.263 --> 42:58.506
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

42:58.541 --> 43:00.439
- So, now that you have all that
money,

43:00.508 --> 43:02.269
are you gonna buy me a Tesla
car?

43:02.338 --> 43:03.408
- Sure.

43:03.442 --> 43:06.514
And even more, it's been a while

43:06.549 --> 43:08.413
since I've been in a
relationship.

43:08.447 --> 43:12.279
And it just feels really
great to be in love again.

[wings flapping]

44:48.168 --> 44:50.135
Hi.
- Oh, hi.

44:50.170 --> 44:51.102
- Is that a rose?

44:55.278 --> 44:56.176
- Kind of.

44:56.210 --> 44:57.418
Looks like a red rose.

44:57.418 --> 45:00.214
It's actually a galaxy far
away called the Lagoon Nebula.

45:00.283 --> 45:01.491
- It's beautiful.

45:01.526 --> 45:04.909
- Yes, beautiful just like you.

45:04.978 --> 45:07.843
- Well, this rose galaxy
is a cosmic beauty.

45:07.877 --> 45:10.121
- Did you capture that picture
on this tiny telescope?

45:10.155 --> 45:11.536
- Yes, I did.

45:11.570 --> 45:12.399
- It's amazing.

45:13.503 --> 45:14.746
- This rose galaxy is actually

45:14.815 --> 45:17.300
two million light years
away from the planet Earth.

45:17.335 --> 45:18.543
- That far?

45:18.577 --> 45:19.440
- Yes, and it's a good thing

45:19.509 --> 45:21.028
that this rose galaxy's so far
away,

45:21.063 --> 45:22.547
so we and this human warming
machine

45:22.581 --> 45:24.825
can't get to it and screw it up.

45:24.860 --> 45:26.206
- Yeah.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.208
- Universe has two trillion
galaxies,

45:28.242 --> 45:30.451
and each galaxy contains
billions of stars.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.350
The sun is one of 200 billion
stars

45:32.384 --> 45:33.903
here in the Milky Way galaxy.

45:33.938 --> 45:35.940
There are stars, planets,
and galaxies out there

45:36.009 --> 45:38.666
that I've categorized as cosmic
beauty.

45:38.701 --> 45:40.668
- Thanks for the quick astronomy
lesson.

45:40.703 --> 45:42.463
- Planet Earth is a cosmic
beauty.

45:42.532 --> 45:45.432
To protect life here,
civilization, and humanity,

45:45.466 --> 45:48.228
we must find a solution
to stop global warming.

45:48.262 --> 45:49.608
- Yes, absolutely.

45:53.198 --> 45:55.925
[waves crashing]

46:29.096 --> 46:31.133
- Wine for the lovely couple.
- Thank you so much.

46:31.167 --> 46:33.721
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

46:33.756 --> 46:36.414
[glasses clink]

46:43.766 --> 46:45.768
Kim, I'm in love with you.

46:47.459 --> 46:48.944
- Just in love?

46:48.978 --> 46:51.429

1:11:17.652 --> 1:11:20.724
Wildfire everywhere,
worldwide year round now.

1:11:20.759 --> 1:11:23.382
And this year, it's the sea
eagles attack.

1:11:23.417 --> 1:11:25.764
And coming soon, you will
not even have air to breathe

1:11:25.798 --> 1:11:27.662
because of the loss of oxygen

1:11:27.731 --> 1:11:30.458
due to the depletion of
plankton in the oceans.

1:11:30.493 --> 1:11:32.736
We're headed towards abrupt
extinction.

1:11:32.771 --> 1:11:35.256
The human race will cease
to exist in a few years.

1:11:36.499 --> 1:11:39.847
They said I was wrong,
on the fringe, a lunatic.

1:11:39.916 --> 1:11:42.228
They even nicknamed me Dr.
Extinction.

1:11:42.263 --> 1:11:43.954
Well now, the endless wildfire,

1:11:43.989 --> 1:11:47.924
drought, floods, birds,
are now in their face.

1:11:47.958 --> 1:11:52.066
- I thought the climate
scientists said we had 'til
2050.

1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:53.930
- Don't believe in that fantasy.

1:11:53.964 --> 1:11:56.277
I'm a climate scientist,
professor emeritus,

1:11:56.312 --> 1:11:58.279
University of San Francisco.

1:11:58.314 --> 1:12:01.144
Earth's temperature has
risen to two degrees Celsius,

1:12:01.178 --> 1:12:04.872
and not the 1.2 Celsius now as
they claim.

1:12:04.941 --> 1:12:08.289
It's not just the CO2, but
other factors like methane gas

1:12:08.324 --> 1:12:09.946
have raised Earth's temperature

1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:11.879
to actual two degrees Celsius,

1:12:11.948 --> 1:12:14.433
where human extinction is
inevitable.

1:12:14.468 --> 1:12:16.090
Even worse, Earth's temperature

1:12:16.124 --> 1:12:18.057
is heading towards 3.5 Celsius,

1:12:18.126 --> 1:12:20.957
where no human life can exist on
Earth.

1:12:20.991 --> 1:12:23.200
- Is there anything we can do to
fix it?

1:12:23.269 --> 1:12:24.167
- No.

1:12:24.201 --> 1:12:25.306
Industrial civilization

1:12:25.341 --> 1:12:27.653
has heated planet Earth
to cause human extinction.

1:12:28.723 --> 1:12:30.967
- [Kim] Are you sure
there's nothing we can do?

1:12:31.001 --> 1:12:33.418
- Yes, we have to accept
our fate, it is death.

1:12:36.455 --> 1:12:38.215
At least we still have love,

1:12:38.250 --> 1:12:40.114
and I see that you are lovely
couples.

1:12:44.187 --> 1:12:46.638
So spend a lot of time
with each other, make love,

1:12:46.672 --> 1:12:48.985
have a lot of sex, be nice to
everyone,

1:12:49.019 --> 1:12:51.194
because at the end,
love is all we have left

1:12:51.228 --> 1:12:53.058
before we go extinct.
