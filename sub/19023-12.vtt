00:08.132 --> 00:09.801
Hey!

00:11.261 --> 00:14.932
What? l didn't say anything.
l didn't do anything.

00:15.015 --> 00:19.102
What imaginary slight have you concocted
in that paranoid brain of yours?

00:23.690 --> 00:24.691
<i>Crap.</i>

00:24.775 --> 00:28.320
Shouldn't there be
some sort of sign...

00:28.403 --> 00:33.450
Look at that. You should put it back
down before someone slips and falls.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.620
Good, because l make most decisions

00:36.703 --> 00:40.541
based on your opinion. l'm thinking
of splitting up with the wife.

00:40.624 --> 00:43.168
Maybe you could mull that over.
Get back to me.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.339
Floor's wet, ma'am.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.802
Little help over here.
Little help.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.847
Move it or lose it, Q-tip.

00:54.930 --> 00:59.434
Q-tip. Cos you're skinny
and your head's fuzzy.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.270
Something's going down.

01:01.353 --> 01:06.024
Bring it in here, you knuckleheads.
Take a knee if you need to.

01:06.108 --> 01:09.486
l have been on since midnight,
so l stand here

01:09.570 --> 01:11.947
with my usual contempt for all of you,

01:12.030 --> 01:15.117
but with the added wrinkle
of having 1 3 cups

01:15.200 --> 01:19.371
of piss-poor excuse for coffee
passing straight through me.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.875
The not-so-hidden message being,
that if you screw up today,

01:22.958 --> 01:25.544
l'm going to hit you hard and fast.

01:25.627 --> 01:30.132
Now, then, l think some of you
may have noticed

01:30.215 --> 01:33.302
that all 27 of the patients
that were here in the lCU

01:33.385 --> 01:36.471
when l started last night
are still alive,

01:36.555 --> 01:39.349
and l intend
for them to still be breathing

01:39.433 --> 01:42.728
when l get the hell outta here
tonight at midnight.

01:43.687 --> 01:48.317
l think you understand what kind of
opportunity we have in front of us.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.655
- What opportunity...
- Shut up!

01:53.739 --> 01:55.824
ln baseball, when a pitcher's hot,

01:55.908 --> 01:58.452
no one talks to him,
just stay out of his way.

01:58.535 --> 02:03.040
- Why are you talking about baseball?
- Cos you should never jinx a pitcher

02:03.123 --> 02:06.919
when he has a chance
to throw a perfect game. My God, Barbie,

02:07.002 --> 02:10.172
how do you put your bra
and panties on in the morning,

02:10.255 --> 02:14.301
all by yourself?
lt's remarkable.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.346
- See, cos he's the pitcher...
- Yeah, l get it now.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.949
<i>A chance to be part
of a perfect game</i>

02:37.032 --> 02:41.578
<i>is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
It just never happens.</i>

02:42.871 --> 02:45.249
<i>Which is why I don't mind
Dr Cox paging me</i>

02:45.332 --> 02:47.501
<i>for the 1 3th time this last hour.</i>

02:47.584 --> 02:50.379
<i>ICU is where
the most critical cases get turfed.</i>

02:50.462 --> 02:54.800
<i>So many patients die here, you
think of death as another co-worker,</i>

02:54.883 --> 02:59.304
<i>looking over your shoulder with the same
demands as everyone else you work with.</i>

02:59.388 --> 03:01.974
Dr Dorian...

03:02.057 --> 03:05.227
l know you're busy, but
my daughter's selling cookies.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.688
Put me down for two boxes
of mint thingies.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.815
She's in second place
in her troop.

03:09.898 --> 03:14.486
lf that girl who's in first keeps
doing well, we're just gonna take her.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.785
Did you think you were gonna cash it in?

03:21.869 --> 03:25.414
ln your face.
You're fine, thank you.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.166
Barbie.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.459
Whatever you need, l'm your girl.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.462
Get me 30 grams of Kayexalate.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.382
Don't dilly-dally trying
to refill your Prozac.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.260
You're on my time now. Go.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.680
Nervous guy. Go to bed 1 8
and get me his tox screen.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.392
Cross your fingers the news is good.
lf it's not, l'm blaming you.

03:45.475 --> 03:49.605
Newbie, start a drain on
the purulent pericarditis in bed 23.

03:49.688 --> 03:53.483
He's a tricky bastard. He's tried
to die five times on me today.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.778
- Keep an eye on him.
- l'm your wingman, Maverick.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.989
<i>l was watching Top Gun.</i>

03:59.072 --> 04:01.992
<i>Did you know that Goose
is the guy from ER?</i>

04:02.075 --> 04:05.204
No, l didn't.
But, but please, keep talking.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.207
<i>You have to keep
an eye on things around here,</i>

04:08.290 --> 04:11.251
<i>cos just when it seems
everything's going great,</i>

04:11.335 --> 04:15.672
<i>that's when the tiniest thing
can throw it all outta whack.</i>

04:17.757 --> 04:22.346
What are you doing? When the lunch lady
asked if you wanted fries, you said no.

04:22.429 --> 04:26.225
- Yeah, but l wanted fries.
- So why didn't you order fries?

04:26.308 --> 04:29.353
Cos l can't have French fries. Duh.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.776
Here. Have 'em all.
Have a fry salad.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.153
What the...? Turk?

04:38.237 --> 04:40.239
Baby, come on.

04:41.406 --> 04:45.702
Girlfriend, you know
l cannot have French fries.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.792
Dr Dorian, l need a favour.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.754
- l'm crazy busy today.
- That's just fine, kiddo.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.090
l won't make the board meeting today.

04:58.173 --> 05:02.135
l'm going to be tied up
at Dr Dorian's pity party.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.888
Should l bring something?
l could rent a clown.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.557
A drunk clown hurt me once.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.768
Just listen to the damn lawyer.
Go, Tom.

05:09.852 --> 05:12.729
lt's Ted.
But hey, it's only been 1 2 years.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.982
One of the social workers

05:15.065 --> 05:19.278
that covers this hospital slipped
and knocked herself unconscious.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.947
She might turn around and sue us.

05:22.030 --> 05:26.159
lf that happens, some of the
higher-ups' heads could roll.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.124
The point is that people
are less likely to sue an institution

05:32.207 --> 05:35.919
if we can put a friendly face on it.
You've got a friendly face.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.254
But, sir, l...

05:37.337 --> 05:39.923
Sacred Heart is calling for your help.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.510
Will you accept the call?

05:47.055 --> 05:51.810
This is a special phone. lf you don't
answer it, you get to be the intern

05:51.894 --> 05:54.855
who does the physicals
over at the state prison!

05:54.938 --> 05:56.190
Hello?

05:56.273 --> 05:59.818
- How are you? l'm Dr Dorian.
- Alex Hanson.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.486
Nice to meet you.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.489
Firm handshake. l like that.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.201
<i>Hello.</i>

06:07.284 --> 06:12.122
Mr Davis, l haven't seen you in three
months. lt's gotta be a record for you.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.501
lgnore the dislocated shoulder
and make small talk.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.419
This ought to help with the pain.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.380
So... what'd you do?

06:20.464 --> 06:24.968
Some woman just pushed me
off the bus. lt was totally unprovoked.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.887
Mr Davis.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.890
l may have told her
that she smelled like wet ass.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.059
There you go.
Be proud of who you are.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.562
- You wear too much mascara.
- You be careful now.

06:35.646 --> 06:38.440
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

06:38.524 --> 06:40.150
Covering for...

06:40.234 --> 06:44.696
Whatever. 36-year-old male,
possible dislocated shoulder.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.532
Great.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.700
So, how are you doing?

06:48.784 --> 06:50.869
lt just got so cold in here.

06:50.953 --> 06:54.623
l think the swelling may have gone down.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.875
Yeah, l hope that hurts.

06:56.959 --> 07:00.671
- Oh, no.
- ls this the tox screen?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.090
This does not bode well for you.

07:03.173 --> 07:07.803
Get the results of Mr Chervin's
urinalysis. lf the numbers aren't good,

07:07.886 --> 07:10.389
l'm gonna give
one of your kidneys to him.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.559
Ten bucks says
l can make him wet himself.

07:13.642 --> 07:17.396
- Everybody's afraid of Mr Man.
- Laverne, you give good sass.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.023
l got the Kayexalate
and pulled the X-rays,

07:20.107 --> 07:22.818
so l am yours.
Do whatever you want with me.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.404
That came out wrong.

07:25.487 --> 07:29.074
l want you to use me.
l don't care how degrading it is.

07:29.157 --> 07:29.825
No, no...

07:29.908 --> 07:34.037
l know that you like torturing people,
and l am up for that.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.874
- l wanna make you happy.
- Marshmallow, hush.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.878
This guy needs a lumbar puncture,
and l need an extra set of hands.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.714
- Ready and raring.
- Ginger, get the lead out.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.632
Excuse me.

07:45.716 --> 07:49.344
- lt puts the lotion on the skin.
- You can do movies and l can't?

07:49.428 --> 07:52.347
lt puts the damn iodine lotion
on the skin.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.266
Mr Man!

08:00.397 --> 08:03.358
Dr Dorian, l owe you an apology.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.485
Obviously,
l was unclear when l said,

08:05.569 --> 08:07.988
''Stay in the MRl room
with that patient.''

08:08.071 --> 08:11.283
lt must have sounded like,
''Leave and do other things.''

08:11.366 --> 08:14.995
Let me rephrase it
so there'll be no more confusion:

08:15.078 --> 08:17.164
Get your ass back down there!

08:20.250 --> 08:22.711
You have no idea
how loud that is in here!

08:22.794 --> 08:25.672
l'm sorry. You'll be done in a second.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.426
Was that a good sound?

08:29.510 --> 08:32.596
- Not that good a sound.
- ls it stuck?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.974
''Stuck'' is a literal term.
lt's more like ''not moving''.

08:36.058 --> 08:39.686
- Pull me outta here!
- l can't. You were unconscious.

08:39.770 --> 08:43.273
You could have an injury.
Be glad you're not claustrophobic.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.694
- Promise you won't leave me.
- l promise.

08:48.904 --> 08:52.950
Dr Cox must have my pager on speed dial.
He's completely on top of me today.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.869
Do you know how much l wish
he was on top of me?

08:55.953 --> 08:58.038
That's naughty.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.624
You make me so mad,
l might actually scream.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.627
Every day you bitch
about how hard Dr Cox is on you,

09:03.710 --> 09:07.381
and you don't even realise
that you're his go-to guy.

09:07.464 --> 09:11.051
- You're overreacting...
- What has he had you do today?

09:11.134 --> 09:13.929
He had me intubate
and extubate Mrs Pollard,

09:14.012 --> 09:18.058
float a Swan on Mr Kalka,
a paracentesis, a radial art line,

09:18.141 --> 09:21.562
then place a transvenous
pacemaker for a heart block.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.731
Why? What did you do?

09:27.943 --> 09:30.237
Cream, no sugar.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.241
He takes his sugar, no cream.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.415
My arm is breaking!

09:41.498 --> 09:44.042
OK. lt's not going in.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.420
Really? Why don't we try kicking it?

09:46.503 --> 09:49.923
- l'll talk to one of our orthopaedics.
- Hurry back.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.092
That guy is the worst.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.928
Be nice. He's my boyfriend.

09:55.012 --> 09:58.515
- Not for long.
- Excuse me?

09:58.599 --> 10:01.435
He's been dying to run
outta here since he came in.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.855
- He did not run out of here.
- You're right.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.609
He was fleeing like he was being chased
by a swarm of killer bees.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.862
He said just keep pulling.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.906
Goody.

10:13.989 --> 10:17.451
Does this big metal contraption
make me look fat?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.161
More chunky than fat.

10:20.454 --> 10:23.790
- JD?
- lt's all right. l'm right here.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.629
You're such a nice guy.

10:28.712 --> 10:32.341
<i>It really feels like
there's something going on here.</i>

10:32.424 --> 10:34.760
<i>I wonder what she looks like.</i>

10:35.802 --> 10:38.931
Why am l always in your fantasies?

10:39.014 --> 10:41.517
You got a problem.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.270
Why are you squeezing
all my fingers?

10:45.354 --> 10:49.441
l'll tell you what l'm not doing.
l'm not checking for a wedding ring.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.610
<i>I am so in.</i>

10:53.195 --> 10:56.031
<i>I'm right back out.</i>

10:56.114 --> 10:58.825
l'm sorry about lunch.
l'm a little overtired.

10:58.909 --> 11:02.746
That's OK. When we get home,
we can go right to bed.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.706
That's the thing. l'm beat,

11:04.790 --> 11:09.336
so it'd be better
if you crash at your place tonight.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.091
lt's a private joke.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.220
- What now?
- Watch the attitude,

11:18.303 --> 11:22.891
or l won't let you go to the bonfire
with the beach bunnies.

11:22.975 --> 11:26.103
<i>I was probably thinking
about the MRI girl,</i>

11:26.186 --> 11:31.525
<i>but I believe that giving a friend the
chance to shine was just as important.</i>

11:31.608 --> 11:35.988
Sir, it's Dr Kelso.
He's making me baby-sit this patient.

11:36.071 --> 11:41.034
lt's the bottom of the ninth. lf you're
not gonna be my catcher, who is?

11:46.248 --> 11:48.292
<i>- What?
-Play ball!</i>

11:50.294 --> 11:53.088
Come on, baby.
Right here. Bring it in.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.432
Dr Cox, you can trust me to help you.

12:03.515 --> 12:06.143
l was top five in my class.

12:06.226 --> 12:10.105
That's the noise
l make when somebody lies to me.

12:10.189 --> 12:12.024
But l'll get us this perfect...

12:12.107 --> 12:13.400
- Don't say it!
- ...game.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.236
What part of ''don't say it''
did you not understand?

12:16.320 --> 12:20.991
The ''don't'' or the ''say it''?
Help me to help you, Barbie.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.040
l should get to work.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.209
That would be lovely.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.465
- Elliot, do...
- No time!

12:36.548 --> 12:39.009
<i>We all have
important things to do.</i>

12:39.092 --> 12:41.720
Do you know what
Alex Hanson looks like?

12:41.803 --> 12:43.722
He's OK.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.392
l don't know.
l don't look at the ladies.

12:47.476 --> 12:50.771
Young man, l've been married
for over three decades.

12:50.854 --> 12:54.107
l would've gone there, though.
Hell yes, l would've.

12:54.191 --> 12:57.236
Who cares?
No one will ever love you.

12:57.319 --> 13:00.030
l don't find her pretty,
but since my wife left,

13:00.113 --> 13:04.326
when l look at a woman,
l find it hard to see past the evil.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.705
- Something's wrong.
- Nothing's wrong.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.625
You always say that,
then you sulk, then you tell me.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.379
You haven't known me long enough
for me to ''always'' do anything.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.922
You're always hurting me.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.884
- So now you're getting defensive?
- Woman, l am not defensive.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.719
You are, a little bit.

13:22.803 --> 13:28.016
Turk, why don't you just take a deep
breath and tell me what's wrong?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.686
That did it.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.938
l guess we're done here.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.653
Barbie, plates
are wobbling everywhere.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.197
l'm starting pressors.

13:42.281 --> 13:44.408
Or you could transfuse him.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.494
- Transfusions are riskier.
- My instinct was pressors.

13:47.578 --> 13:51.039
- Know what they say about instincts?
- Stick with them.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.457
- Should you?
- Should l?

13:52.541 --> 13:57.254
You'll have time to think about it on
the bench. That's where you're headed.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.675
Get out of here. Go ahead.
Go. Hippety-hop to the barbershop.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.553
''Should l?''

14:04.636 --> 14:07.723
Did she ask what you look like?

14:07.806 --> 14:12.269
No, she can tell l'm handsome.
l have a husky voice. ''Hello, baby.''

14:12.352 --> 14:14.813
Look into your heart
and see how it feels.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.773
My heart hates ''uggos''.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.276
That's what's wrong with you men.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.614
You're so afraid of what you feel.
l'm so sick of it.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.200
So do you know
what she looks like?

14:26.283 --> 14:28.493
Yeah, l do.
But l ain't telling you.

14:28.577 --> 14:33.457
Just tell me. Does she look
anything like Jimmie Walker?

14:35.918 --> 14:39.630
l'm noticing the bottoms
of your slippers are rather slick.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.926
Perhaps they contributed in some way
to the incident this morning.

14:44.009 --> 14:47.179
Those are hospital booties,
you moron.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.640
And now l'm a moron.

14:49.723 --> 14:53.977
Dr Dorian, why don't you take Ms Hanson
out for a lovely dinner?

14:54.061 --> 14:57.397
Dr Kelso, l'm not suing the hospital.

14:57.481 --> 15:00.567
lt turns out
l only have a mild concussion.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.653
Alex? He's gone.

15:02.736 --> 15:07.366
So, what restaurant
are you taking me to?

15:07.449 --> 15:10.828
<i>You're not bad if you want to wait
and see what she looks like.</i>

15:10.911 --> 15:13.789
l'm kidding. You don't have
to take me out to dinner.

15:13.872 --> 15:17.292
Are you sure? Cos... OK.

15:18.669 --> 15:20.754
l gotta go. Sorry.

15:20.838 --> 15:24.258
Don't sweat it.
We'll see each other around.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.635
JD, l'm really glad you were here...

15:26.718 --> 15:29.638
Ms Hanson, he's gone.

15:29.721 --> 15:34.184
lf l were in your slippers, l'd sue
this hospital for all it's worth.

15:34.268 --> 15:35.435
Really?

15:35.519 --> 15:38.063
We could run away together.

15:40.274 --> 15:45.487
You know what to do. Be straight
with Carla, no matter how hard it is.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.739
l hate this part.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.744
l just don't know
what to do about Dr Cox.

15:52.828 --> 15:56.748
- What is going on here?
- l say one thing, he says the other.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.709
l can't take it any more.

15:58.792 --> 16:02.379
Why don't you become a lesbian,
and hook up with some hot model?

16:02.462 --> 16:06.550
- What's that got to do with anything?
- l just thought it'd be hot.

16:06.633 --> 16:12.389
He's testing you. You can't be afraid
to disagree with him.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.893
- You're afraid.
- But l still do it.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.688
Get back in the game, Elliot.

18:08.172 --> 18:09.840
Dammit!

18:12.426 --> 18:14.511
So close. Dammit!

18:17.639 --> 18:19.308
l'm sorry.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.435
l'll be fine.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.524
Perfect game.

18:28.650 --> 18:29.693
Call it.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.906
There's five minutes left, just
the two of us here. Can't we just wait?

18:33.989 --> 18:35.991
Just call it.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.704
No.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.998
We all need this, so, no.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.209
l won't call it.

18:45.918 --> 18:50.672
That's the dumbest thing anybody's
said to me around here in a long time.

18:50.756 --> 18:55.552
There's nothing wrong with a one-hitter.
ln fact, it's miraculous.

18:55.636 --> 18:59.973
l won't have you cheapen what should
be an endless pursuit of perfection

19:00.057 --> 19:03.519
just because you want the world
to laugh with you tonight.

19:03.602 --> 19:05.020
Now, call it.

19:05.103 --> 19:08.023
Time of death, 1 1 .55.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.859
Good girl.

19:10.943 --> 19:13.654
Better go get
yourself a cup of coffee.

19:13.737 --> 19:16.198
New game starts in four minutes.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.624
Hey, Carla.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.252
Carla, wait!

19:28.335 --> 19:29.753
Where are you going?

19:29.837 --> 19:32.965
l'm gonna go crash at my place
tonight, like you said.

19:33.048 --> 19:35.467
You want to know?
That's what's wrong.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.387
''l'm gonna go chill out
at my house, like you said.''

19:38.470 --> 19:40.514
God, you're so sexy right now.

19:40.597 --> 19:44.184
l've been doing a lot of thinking.
And, you know...

19:44.268 --> 19:47.312
We're past that new,
exciting relationship phase,

19:47.396 --> 19:49.314
and all that's left is us.

19:49.398 --> 19:51.942
Baby, l gotta tell you,
you drive me crazy.

19:52.025 --> 19:56.280
You take my French fries, you boss
me around in front of my friends.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.824
You said strong women turn you on.

19:58.907 --> 20:04.413
We know what you're gonna do,
so why not do it so l can go home?

20:04.496 --> 20:05.539
OK.

20:11.170 --> 20:13.005
l love you.

20:14.548 --> 20:17.467
You annoy me more than
l ever thought possible,

20:17.551 --> 20:20.846
but l want to spend every
irritating minute with you.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.267
Me too.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.019
Yeah?

20:28.228 --> 20:30.439
l love you.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.153
l don't get it.
Why are you doing this to me?

20:36.236 --> 20:40.449
All l wanted to do was have sex
with a foxy nurse, and now l'm in love?

20:40.532 --> 20:43.535
Sweetie, that happens.

20:47.164 --> 20:50.334
<i>I've been thinking lately
about taking chances...</i>

20:50.417 --> 20:53.670
Run a tox screen and
a full blood workup for the guy in 37.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.339
You can handle that?

20:55.422 --> 20:56.882
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

20:56.965 --> 21:01.386
Up on the second floor... There's a
laundry list of stuff l want you to do.

21:01.470 --> 21:04.389
<i>...and how it's just
about overcoming your fears.</i>

21:04.473 --> 21:07.518
<i>Because every time
you take a big risk in your life,</i>

21:07.601 --> 21:11.230
<i>no matter how it ends up,
you're always glad you took it.</i>

21:13.440 --> 21:15.651
Wait! Stop the machine.

21:15.734 --> 21:19.488
- What the hell are you doing?
- Will you go out with me?

21:19.571 --> 21:22.115
lf l say no, will you
let me out of this thing?

21:22.199 --> 21:24.701
- lt's iffy.
- Then l guess l have to say yes.

21:24.785 --> 21:28.372
- So say it.
- Sure. l'd love to.

21:34.545 --> 21:36.213
Huh?
