WEBVTT

00:07.960 --> 00:08.852
Morning.

00:08.852 --> 00:10.598
You don't wish me happy birthday?

00:11.076 --> 00:12.522
Happy birthday.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.262
I'm going for a run.

00:14.307 --> 00:16.538
Running? Now? Why?

00:16.545 --> 00:19.128
Well, I wanna feel good for me
and I wanna look good for you.

00:19.136 --> 00:21.967
Well, you look good for me. Come
here. I'll be your birthday workout

00:21.974 --> 00:24.880
Uh, that's tempting, but you
might have to be my cool down.

00:27.245 --> 00:28.972
Wait, didn't you go running last night?

00:29.092 --> 00:31.195
Uh, no. I went to the gym last night.

00:31.196 --> 00:33.645
- Isn't all this a little bit...
- Gay?

00:33.646 --> 00:36.090
- Frantic?
- Well, I am aging fast.

00:36.091 --> 00:37.515
- You're 39.
- I know.

00:37.516 --> 00:39.816
I have a whole year to prepare
for complete decrepitude.

00:42.261 --> 00:43.906
Kevin, are you all right?

00:43.907 --> 00:45.537
I mean, you've been
through a lot recently.

00:45.538 --> 00:48.280
Every time I think that, I remember Aaron,

00:48.281 --> 00:49.791
and I realize I haven't
been through anything.

00:49.792 --> 00:52.377
- Have you talked to him again?
- Yeah,

00:52.378 --> 00:53.772
'cause that's just what he wants to hear.

00:53.773 --> 00:55.047
"Hey, I'm the guy who
put you in the wheelchair.

00:55.048 --> 00:55.607
You want to hang out?"

00:55.608 --> 00:56.917
You didn't put him in a wheelchair Kevin.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.004
All right. Let's not
adjudicate this again.

00:59.005 --> 01:02.467
Accident or no accident, I hit him,
he fell he's managed to move on.

01:02.468 --> 01:03.620
I'm trying to do the same.

01:04.697 --> 01:08.146
All right, go running.
Breakfast will be waiting.

01:08.147 --> 01:11.475
Great. Hey, when I get back,
maybe we can call Michelle.

01:11.476 --> 01:13.089
Oh, she's not gonna know anything yet.

01:13.090 --> 01:15.324
Well, how long does it
take to read a blood test?

01:15.325 --> 01:17.567
Why can't she just use one
of those pregnancy strips...

01:17.568 --> 01:19.570
you know, a little pee and
then five minutes later,

01:19.571 --> 01:21.810
we know whether the stork's coming or not?

01:21.811 --> 01:24.891
Well, this is a little
more scientific, certain.

01:29.210 --> 01:31.067
Oh, God. It's mom.

01:31.068 --> 01:31.877
Well, just answer.

01:31.878 --> 01:33.814
- She just wants to wish you a happy birthday.
- Yeah,

01:33.815 --> 01:35.727
and make sure I'm going
to her party tonight.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.679
You haven't told her you're not going?

01:37.680 --> 01:39.122
Well, I'll send her an email.

01:39.123 --> 01:40.805
Oh, Kevin. It's a
little bit late for that.

01:40.806 --> 01:42.415
If you don't tell her, she's
gonna be cooking all day

01:42.416 --> 01:45.235
what part of "I don't wanna talk
to her" does she not understand?

01:45.236 --> 01:47.754
Kevin, she thought she
was doing the right thing,

01:47.755 --> 01:49.841
it is not totally her fault.

01:49.842 --> 01:51.639
Okay, not telling me about Aaron...

01:51.640 --> 01:52.873
was not a mistake.

01:52.874 --> 01:56.101
She thought about it and
executed it for over 25 years.

01:56.102 --> 01:57.366
I'd say that's her fault.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.109
And this is something I
have to work through myself.

02:00.110 --> 02:02.310
Okay.

02:02.311 --> 02:04.580
Just tell me what you want to do today.

02:06.482 --> 02:08.881
Well, I'm gonna have lunch
with Justin and Tommy.

02:08.882 --> 02:11.843
And then I thought tonight,
maybe we can go out,

02:11.844 --> 02:14.071
- just you and me.
- Okay.

02:18.594 --> 02:20.406
Hold that thought.

02:23.452 --> 02:26.401
Okay, come on, guys. Mrs. Fowler's here.

02:26.402 --> 02:27.620
You know how she gets.

02:27.621 --> 02:28.794
Did you sign my permission slip?

02:28.795 --> 02:30.660
- Right there. Did you get your math homework?
- Yeah.

02:30.661 --> 02:33.722
- Luc, did you give me cookies?
- I wouldn't forget the cookies.

02:33.723 --> 02:35.389
- Yes!
- Okay, come here, little one.

02:35.390 --> 02:38.800
- Get outta here.
- Au revoir, Luc.

02:38.801 --> 02:40.407
- Au revoir, mes petites.
- Au revoir.

02:48.199 --> 02:49.309
The bedroom?

02:49.310 --> 02:51.246
No. No time.

02:52.275 --> 02:54.771
Oh, God. Wait. Oh, no.

02:54.772 --> 02:55.921
- What, what, what, what?
- No. No, no, no, no.

02:55.922 --> 02:57.219
I have a meeting in half an hour.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.100
Well, then we half an hour.

02:58.101 --> 03:00.739
No, we don't have half an
hour. I'm not on euro time.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.900
I have to go. Saul and
Holly called a meeting.

03:03.901 --> 03:05.303
It's about Narrow Lake, I think.

03:05.304 --> 03:08.393
Hopefully, they've got
that geo survey back.

03:08.394 --> 03:11.395
Yeah, Narrow Lake... a funny
name for a place without a lake.

03:11.396 --> 03:13.962
Yeah. Well, I just hope that
there's something there...

03:13.963 --> 03:15.796
something worth a lot of money...

03:15.797 --> 03:17.563
because after everything that
this company has put us through

03:17.564 --> 03:21.067
it would be very nice
to find a silver lining.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.193
Or gold, right?

03:22.194 --> 03:24.782
Exactement.

03:24.783 --> 03:29.495
Could we, um... pick up...

03:29.496 --> 03:32.689
- where we left off... tonight?
- I hope so.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.922
Mm. Okay. Where are my keys?

03:35.923 --> 03:38.551
Hmm? Ah, keys.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.665
What's all this stuff?

03:40.666 --> 03:43.022
Ah, it's my winter jackets.

03:44.251 --> 03:48.148
Wh... wh... why? Wh... you don't
think you'll be back by winter?

03:48.149 --> 03:50.816
No, matter of fact, I will be
back even before I need a sweater.

03:50.817 --> 03:52.762
I promise.

03:52.763 --> 03:57.259
But you don't know that,
do you? Oh, God, Luc.

03:57.260 --> 03:58.835
You're gonna be gone in two weeks.

03:58.836 --> 04:01.387
This is... this is
suddenly a little too real.

04:01.388 --> 04:03.566
Look, they might even renew
my visa. You never know.

04:03.567 --> 04:06.837
Don't say that.You know it's
actually worse if I have hope.

04:13.108 --> 04:15.476
Oh, my mother, again.

04:15.477 --> 04:17.697
Twice already this morning.

04:17.697 --> 04:20.903
It's Kevin's birthday, and
he's not talking to her.

04:20.904 --> 04:22.529
I... I know your family for a while now.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.665
Trust me. He'll come around.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.077
You just don't give up, do you?

04:29.078 --> 04:32.889
You just have faith that
everything is going to be fine.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.276
I guess, yeah.

04:34.277 --> 04:38.343
Okay. That is going to
be my mantra for the day.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.356
Everything is going to be fine.

04:40.357 --> 04:41.809
Everything's gonna be fine.

04:41.810 --> 04:45.444
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- I love you.

04:45.445 --> 04:48.920
I love you more.
Everything's gonna be fine.

04:52.163 --> 04:54.127
Oh! They're all ignoring me.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.797
Who's that?

04:55.798 --> 04:58.896
Your brothers and sisters, that's who.

04:58.897 --> 05:01.286
That... that's maybe not true.

05:01.287 --> 05:03.757
You're coming tonight, right?

05:03.758 --> 05:05.197
Mom, I'm staying here.

05:05.198 --> 05:06.654
Well, look,

05:06.655 --> 05:12.307
I know it's difficult right now between
Kevin and me, but he is going to be here.

05:12.308 --> 05:15.337
- I hope so.
- And it would be really helpful

05:15.338 --> 05:17.196
if you would all call him and tell him

05:17.197 --> 05:19.297
how excited you are
about the party tonight.

05:19.298 --> 05:21.493
Yeah, okay, mom. Look, I've gotta get to Ojai.

05:21.494 --> 05:23.838
Are you sure you don't want
to come to this meeting?

05:23.839 --> 05:25.430
It's all about Narrow Lake.

05:25.431 --> 05:27.975
No, it's not gonna change
anything and if I have meeting

05:27.976 --> 05:29.771
and it's Kevin's birthday. I have to cook.

05:29.772 --> 05:33.149
Yeah. Uh, you might want to wait until...

05:33.150 --> 05:35.560
Until what, the butcher's out of squab?

05:35.561 --> 05:37.943
- I don't think so.
- You're making squab?

05:37.944 --> 05:41.538
Squab, and I'm stuffing
it. Tell them all that.

05:41.539 --> 05:42.964
Stuffing it.

05:46.109 --> 05:47.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:47.853 --> 05:49.238
- How's mom?
- Making squab.

05:49.239 --> 05:51.707
Oh, my God. She is unbelievable.

05:51.708 --> 05:53.139
She is in so much denial.

05:53.140 --> 05:54.862
She called me twice already this morning.

05:54.863 --> 05:57.053
I know. She kept calling
Justin and me, too.

05:57.054 --> 05:58.174
And you didn't answered?

05:58.175 --> 06:01.249
- Did you?
- No. But come on, honestly,

06:01.250 --> 06:03.586
somebody has to tell her
in no uncertain terms,

06:03.587 --> 06:05.182
Kevin is not coming.

06:05.183 --> 06:07.403
Hi. Sorry we're late.

06:07.404 --> 06:08.306
What's going on?

06:08.307 --> 06:13.240
Listen, Saul and I talked to the
bank, and they're calling in our loan.

06:13.241 --> 06:16.079
We're gonna be left with
no operating capital.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.350
And as of next week, the
bank is gonna seize this land

06:19.351 --> 06:21.414
- and the building.
- Okay, we get a bridge loan,

06:21.415 --> 06:22.775
we start to reorganize.

06:22.776 --> 06:24.397
Sarah, Holly and I have
been on the phone all morning

06:24.398 --> 06:26.437
going over the financials
with a loan broker.

06:26.438 --> 06:30.781
As far as they're concerned, our
company is not valuable enough.

06:30.782 --> 06:32.091
Well, did you tell them about Narrow Lake?

06:32.092 --> 06:35.379
There's obviously value there or York would
never have made such a ridiculous offer.

06:35.380 --> 06:36.420
Sarah, listen to me.

06:36.421 --> 06:38.655
- They are not interested.
- That's what I'm saying.

06:38.656 --> 06:40.994
We have to take this deal on Wednesday.

06:40.995 --> 06:43.702
Because if we don't, by the end
of the week York is gonna be able

06:43.703 --> 06:46.296
to buy Ojai from the receiver
at pennies on the dollar,

06:46.297 --> 06:48.109
which means we will end up with nothing.

06:48.110 --> 06:51.363
Yeah, but we can't sell to York
before we know what's it's worth.

06:51.364 --> 06:53.325
No, Tommy, we have to. We all have to.

06:53.326 --> 06:55.997
- There's no time left.
- I'm... I'm sorry, but I'm confused.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.179
What happened to the $2 million I gave you

06:58.180 --> 07:00.473
- to invest back in the company last month?
- You did?

07:00.474 --> 07:05.002
- Yeah.
- Rebecca, that is in a separate account where it is safe.

07:05.003 --> 07:09.491
- I didn't give it to you to be safe.
- $2 million, that could keep us open for...

07:09.492 --> 07:11.975
For... for... for what, Saul,
four months, five months?

07:11.976 --> 07:14.717
- And then what?
- Holly, that's probably all that we need.

07:14.718 --> 07:17.259
Yeah, but it may not be.
We may still go broke.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.748
But I'm not gonna let her get wiped out.

07:19.749 --> 07:20.433
I can't believe this.

07:20.434 --> 07:22.991
I cannot believe that I gave
you a solution to this problem,

07:22.992 --> 07:26.366
- and you won't accept it.
- Rebecca, I know what I'm doing.

07:26.367 --> 07:30.022
R... ugh. I... I... I can't believe
that you didn't back me on this.

07:30.023 --> 07:32.575
She just offered us a
way to save ourselves.

07:32.576 --> 07:34.518
For reasons I don't
understand, you turned her down.

07:34.519 --> 07:37.966
I am not gonna use any of that
money unless I am guaranteed

07:37.967 --> 07:40.317
that she will get a decent return.

07:40.318 --> 07:43.171
I am trying to protect my family here.

07:43.172 --> 07:46.414
- This is a family business, and we're all family now.
- Yeah, come on.

07:46.415 --> 07:48.683
Rebecca's obviously got
faith in this company, Holly.

07:48.684 --> 07:50.852
- Why don't you?
- E... enough.

07:50.853 --> 07:53.444
This is between my daughter and me.

07:53.445 --> 07:56.207
Pretend that that money doesn't exist,

07:56.208 --> 07:58.999
because as far as Ojai
is concerned, it doesn't.

08:04.772 --> 08:07.745
I'm not giving up. I'm making some calls.

08:10.527 --> 08:17.380
Roast squab with wild rice
stuffing, mango chutney...

08:17.381 --> 08:19.844
Oh. With sage jus.

08:19.845 --> 08:24.842
Yes, I know, it's a bit ambitious for
a home cook, but I really want to do it.

08:24.843 --> 08:27.331
Well, Nora, if... if
anyone can do it, you can,

08:27.332 --> 08:30.508
but I don't think you
should. Kevin's not coming.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.221
Well, I know that's what he's saying,

08:32.222 --> 08:34.956
- but everyone else will be here.
- But they don't want to.

08:34.957 --> 08:38.111
No one wants to sit around
waiting for Kevin to show up,

08:38.113 --> 08:40.820
- watching you get depressed.
- Look, Scotty, I'm no fool.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.856
I know what's going on.

08:42.857 --> 08:45.555
Maybe he'll change his
mind and decide he...

08:45.556 --> 08:48.430
he wants to spend his
birthday with his family,

08:48.431 --> 08:52.068
exactly the way he's done for
the past 38 years in a row.

08:52.069 --> 08:55.587
I just don't want you to
go through all this trouble.

08:55.588 --> 08:59.186
Look, I know what Kevin's
doing is probably not healthy,

08:59.187 --> 09:00.754
but that's where he is right now.

09:00.755 --> 09:03.481
And that's not gonna change in
time for his birthday dinner.

09:03.482 --> 09:05.714
Well, I'll just have to take that chance.

09:05.715 --> 09:08.376
Look, if you don't have faith

09:08.377 --> 09:10.379
that the world will
turn in your direction,

09:10.380 --> 09:11.899
then it just simply never will.

09:11.900 --> 09:17.358
I love my son, no matter what
he feels about me right now.

09:17.359 --> 09:20.611
And as long as I live, he
can count on me to do that...

09:20.612 --> 09:24.514
love him, in... any way I can.

09:24.515 --> 09:28.010
God, I wish I had a mother like you.

09:28.011 --> 09:30.088
Well, I wish Kevin felt like that.

09:30.089 --> 09:32.293
How is he? I miss him.

09:32.294 --> 09:34.884
Well, you know, he says he's fine.

09:34.885 --> 09:37.839
He actually hasn't stood still
long enough for me to really know.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.830
Actually, we're both nervous.

09:40.831 --> 09:43.141
Michelle gets her blood test today.

09:43.142 --> 09:44.443
Really?

09:44.932 --> 09:46.735
She's pregnant.

09:46.736 --> 09:48.486
I know it. I know it.

09:48.487 --> 09:49.789
Oh, God. I hope you're right.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.996
I'm so nervous, I can hardly breathe.

09:51.997 --> 09:54.056
I just keep trying to remind
myself, try to stay positive,

09:54.057 --> 09:55.853
believe that it will be okay.

09:55.854 --> 09:59.045
Welcome to the club.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.814
You know what, Nora?

10:03.815 --> 10:06.282
Maybe you are crazy, but...

10:06.283 --> 10:09.092
I'm in.

10:09.093 --> 10:11.296
If Kevin comes, we'll have a feast.

10:11.297 --> 10:14.561
And if he doesn't, I'll take him out.

10:14.562 --> 10:16.762
Want me to bake the cake?

10:16.763 --> 10:18.654
If you bake it, he will come.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.074

10:30.267 --> 10:33.196
- Hey!
- Hey, good morning. Good morning.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.796
Look who it is. It's daddy.

10:34.797 --> 10:37.994
What does daddy have on the agenda today?

10:37.995 --> 10:42.081
Uh, I have a couple of things
in L.A. that I need to pin down.

10:42.082 --> 10:44.249
Things to pin down in L.A.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.870
Sounds like a... a... a...

10:45.871 --> 10:49.343
Oh, my God. It's my mother again.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.468
You know, you should answered

10:50.469 --> 10:52.039
- 'cause I'm... I'm running late anyway.
- No.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.612
No, I'm not gonna answer it.

10:53.613 --> 10:54.846
You know, she keeps on talking about

10:54.847 --> 10:57.548
this birthday dinner party,
and it's not gonna happen.

10:57.549 --> 10:59.992
And I hate to be the one
who has to break it to her.

10:59.993 --> 11:04.559
Look, I told you that I
wouldn't keep anything from you

11:04.560 --> 11:07.726
so I think you should
know, I'm going to L.A.

11:07.727 --> 11:10.894
- to talk about a job.
- A job?

11:12.859 --> 11:17.771
Well... since when have
you been looking for a job?

11:17.772 --> 11:20.510
And because of the nature of the job...

11:20.511 --> 11:22.731
I am not gonna be able to discuss it.

11:22.732 --> 11:26.163
Not even with your wife?

11:26.164 --> 11:28.893
Okay, so this is one of
those where if you tell me,

11:28.894 --> 11:30.984
then you'll what, have to kill me?

11:31.862 --> 11:34.404
All right, you have to
promise me one thing.

11:34.405 --> 11:37.005
Just tell me that you're not
gonna be in the middle east.

11:37.006 --> 11:38.739
No, no. It's... it's in D.C.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.100
- My God.
- It... it's... it's not a fait accomplied

11:42.101 --> 11:43.456
I mean, I have a pro forma physical

11:43.457 --> 11:44.730
I have to do in L.A. today,

11:44.731 --> 11:47.379
and then I have to fly back
for a final meeting with state

11:47.380 --> 11:50.490
and then a run by to see the president.

11:50.491 --> 11:52.808
Oh, he's gonna run by
and see the president.

11:52.809 --> 11:55.615
But look, I mean, you're
gonna win your race.

11:55.616 --> 11:59.152
We're gonna be in D.C. anyway
when congress is in session.

11:59.153 --> 12:02.016
You know, maybe we should
think about selling this place.

12:02.017 --> 12:05.793
I... you... you have to understand

12:05.794 --> 12:09.545
that... that I have to rearrange
everything in my mind, okay?

12:09.546 --> 12:14.071
And... and this is gonna take a lot
longer than five minutes for me to process.

12:14.072 --> 12:16.758
And... and by the way, you
are going to have to deal

12:16.759 --> 12:20.082
- with the wrath of grandma.
- I'm more worried about that than
I'm dealing with the president.

12:21.415 --> 12:23.249
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

12:25.526 --> 12:28.780
A bad burger and a tuna
melt at a hospital cafeteria

12:28.781 --> 12:31.423
isn't exactly the special
birthday lunch I had planned,

12:31.424 --> 12:33.860
but if you want to see
Justin, this is how you do it.

12:33.861 --> 12:36.725
- This is exactly the birthday I had in mind.
- And I guess that birthday

12:36.726 --> 12:37.749
doesn't include going to see mom tonight.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.304
- You know she's still...
- Tell her to stop, please. All right?

12:40.305 --> 12:43.317
- Hello, brothers.
- Wow, look at our little Justin.

12:43.318 --> 12:44.845
What, did you mug a doctor and steal

12:44.846 --> 12:46.770
- his uniform?
- I'm gonna be a doctor.

12:46.771 --> 12:48.620
Well, and they let you
practice on actual humans?

12:48.621 --> 12:50.656
Well, that is the general idea.

12:50.657 --> 12:52.401
But you know what, guys?
It's so good to see you.

12:52.402 --> 12:53.997
Go ahead, mock me. I love it.

12:53.998 --> 12:55.310
As long as I'm not in the library. Well,

12:55.311 --> 12:56.449
now you're taking all the fun out of it.

12:56.450 --> 12:57.924
Sorry to ruin your birthday, Kevin.

12:57.925 --> 12:59.438
Nothing to ruin. Best birthday ever.

12:59.439 --> 13:01.583
- Speaking of which, mom...
- What, don't tell me, she called?

13:01.584 --> 13:03.031
- Yeah, four times.
- Ugh.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.758
- Did you answer?
- No, I didn't answer. I was with patients.

13:05.759 --> 13:07.697
And why do I have to
be the one to tell her

13:07.698 --> 13:09.051
that nobody's gonna
come? It doesn't matter.

13:09.052 --> 13:10.899
She, you know... you know
mom. She won't give up.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.201
Where does that come from?

13:12.202 --> 13:14.571
I don't know. But I think
I inherited some of it.

13:14.572 --> 13:16.084
Sorry. You can't talk me into it.

13:16.085 --> 13:17.069
No, I'm over that. Trust me.

13:17.070 --> 13:19.619
I don't like giving
up, even when it's bad.

13:19.620 --> 13:21.946
And things are as bad
as they can get at Ojai.

13:21.947 --> 13:23.490
So what think you're gonna do?

13:23.491 --> 13:26.208
I made an appointment with Dennis York.

13:26.209 --> 13:28.431
Den... what are you gonna do, beat him up?

13:28.432 --> 13:30.365
No, I'm gonna do something
we businessmen call

13:30.366 --> 13:33.724
- negotiate, Justin.
- Were you seriously considering doing this without me?

13:33.829 --> 13:35.116
Kevin, it's Dennis York.

13:35.117 --> 13:36.425
You have way too much emotional baggage...

13:36.426 --> 13:37.426
What do I do for a living?

13:37.268 --> 13:40.077
- Nothing. You're unemployed.
- Okay... ugh. What's my profession?

13:40.078 --> 13:41.451
- You're a lawyer.
- Exactly, so I think I

13:41.452 --> 13:44.097
can control myself in a negotiation.

13:44.098 --> 13:45.566
- I'm coming with you.
- Well, if he's going, I'm going.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.135
- Guys, this isn't a road trip.
- No, it's a business trip,

13:48.136 --> 13:51.038
and Ojai is a family business,
so let's let York see that.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.988
Just fill me in on, you know, the plan,

13:52.989 --> 13:54.891
- so I don't laugh in all the wrong places.
- All right, fine.

13:54.892 --> 13:56.888
I'll suss it out, see
how hard I can push him.

13:56.889 --> 13:58.468
The good thing is, he
doesn't know we don't have a

13:58.469 --> 14:00.436
- dime left.
- Does he know I found out about Aaron?

14:00.437 --> 14:01.728
No, not yet. I haven't told him.

14:01.729 --> 14:04.024
- That's gonna be my first move.
- No, I sh... I

14:04.025 --> 14:05.713
should tell him. Seeing
me is your best tactic.

14:05.714 --> 14:06.719
What's your second move?

14:06.720 --> 14:09.886
Well, I think he'll be interesting
to know that we found Narrow Lake.

14:09.887 --> 14:12.047
It should give us enough
time to restructure the deal.

14:12.048 --> 14:13.509
I like it, I like it.

14:13.510 --> 14:14.941
Let him think that we're
holding all the cards.

14:14.942 --> 14:16.466
Long enough to fix it so we do.

14:18.154 --> 14:20.525
No, I've got the document right here.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.297
Can I get it messengered over to you?

14:22.298 --> 14:24.285
Okay.

14:24.286 --> 14:28.013
So if we're approved, when could
I expect the funds to come through?

14:28.014 --> 14:33.965
But it wouldn't really be a bridge loan

14:33.966 --> 14:36.463
if we had to wait till
September, would it?

14:36.464 --> 14:38.795
I understand. Funds are tight.

14:38.796 --> 14:41.782
Yeah. No, I... I understand completely.

14:41.783 --> 14:43.012
Thank you. Thanks again.

14:43.013 --> 14:44.706
For nothing. Damn it.

14:44.707 --> 14:46.289
Babe, you okay?

14:48.274 --> 14:49.886
Is that yours?

14:49.887 --> 14:51.561
- Yeah. You want to keep it?
- No.

14:51.562 --> 14:54.061
No, Luc, I don't want to keep it.

14:54.062 --> 14:57.785
Your sweater... is that going in here?

14:57.786 --> 15:01.285
What about your art stuff?
Is that going in the same box?

15:01.286 --> 15:02.551
Let's pop it in there.

15:02.552 --> 15:04.654
- Sarah, stop. Don't take it out on me.
- No, no, no, Luc.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.773
I cannot watch you pack
slowly, one box at a time.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.384
It's like Chinese water torture.

15:09.385 --> 15:12.385
Let's get it over and done with, okay?

15:12.386 --> 15:14.027
Because I can't stand it anymore.

15:24.738 --> 15:25.932
Oh, really?

15:25.933 --> 15:27.642
I heard you guys were lending again.

15:27.643 --> 15:30.810
No, no, no. No, they called in the loans

15:30.811 --> 15:33.243
because of their internal
problems, not because of ours.

15:33.244 --> 15:35.108
If I...

15:38.287 --> 15:39.588
Okay. Bye.

15:39.589 --> 15:41.900
Well, that didn't sound good.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.858
No, it wasn't. I have
called so many people

15:43.859 --> 15:46.785
trying to get money to keep
Ojai afloat, my thumbs hurt.

15:46.786 --> 15:48.330
I've got one more long shot.

15:48.331 --> 15:50.190
After that, I don't
know what I'm gonna do.

15:50.191 --> 15:51.512
Oh, I'm sorry Sarah.

15:51.513 --> 15:57.306
What's all this? Don't tell me mom is still
thinking about having this silly dinner tonight.

15:57.307 --> 16:01.485
How does she put all of this
stuff together without a recipe.

16:01.486 --> 16:03.210
Ugh. She's like a blind musician.

16:03.211 --> 16:04.683
She just feels the music.

16:04.684 --> 16:07.375
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

16:07.376 --> 16:11.215
Well, somebody's gotta tell mom
that Kevin isn't coming to dinner.

16:11.216 --> 16:12.554
Oh, God, are you gonna do that now?

16:13.833 --> 16:15.317
If you're here to tell me to quit,

16:15.318 --> 16:17.475
you're wasting your time. Don't bother.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.921
- Hi, mom.
- Hi.

16:18.922 --> 16:20.829
How... how are you? How's it going?

16:20.830 --> 16:23.449
Oh, you girls. Don't play games with me.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.102
I realize that neither of you had the guts

16:26.103 --> 16:28.312
to pick up my phone calls
today and talk to me.

16:28.313 --> 16:29.856
So what do you have to say to me now?

16:29.857 --> 16:33.790
Uh, y... you know, mom, here's the thing...

16:33.791 --> 16:36.431
Sarah and I are pretty convinced

16:36.432 --> 16:38.912
that Kevin is not gonna
be coming to dinner.

16:38.913 --> 16:40.778
No, I don't think he is either.

16:40.779 --> 16:42.347
But that's not gonna stop me.

16:42.348 --> 16:45.134
Uh, Sarah, do you think
Luc can join us tonight?

16:45.135 --> 16:47.860
No. No, I don't think so.

16:47.861 --> 16:50.575
And, uh, mom, I don't think I can either.

16:50.576 --> 16:51.949
Excuse me. I gotta take this call.

16:51.950 --> 16:54.104
You know, mom, I have a good idea.

16:54.105 --> 16:56.476
Why don't we wait until next year?

16:56.477 --> 16:58.844
I mean, it's gonna be his 40th.

16:58.845 --> 17:01.799
Well, on his 40th, I'll do it again.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.667
Ooh, I'm getting a text.

17:03.668 --> 17:05.934
How exciting. I'm getting a text.

17:05.935 --> 17:08.733
Um... "Pack your bags.

17:08.734 --> 17:11.409
Job interview couldn't have gone better"?

17:11.410 --> 17:12.848
From Robert. What the hell does that mean?

17:12.849 --> 17:15.277
M... mom, that... that's my phone.

17:15.278 --> 17:17.804
Oh, God. Sorry.

17:17.805 --> 17:21.268
What job interview?

17:21.269 --> 17:23.877
Uh, I don't know. I don't
know. He won't tell me yet.

17:23.878 --> 17:26.653
Yeah, but he tells you to pack
your bags. What's going on?

17:28.175 --> 17:31.359
W... why is it that no one will just
say whatever it is they have to say?

17:31.360 --> 17:32.465
Go on. Tell me the truth.

17:32.466 --> 17:35.335
Well, because I don't know
what is it yet. I swear.

17:35.336 --> 17:38.596
So where is this big,
secretive job, in Washington?

17:38.597 --> 17:41.357
Y... yes.

17:41.358 --> 17:44.185
Oh. Oh, okay.

17:44.186 --> 17:47.873
Well, so Robert has been a senator,
and he's worked there for years.

17:47.874 --> 17:50.606
And if you win, then the both
of you can fly back and forth.

17:50.607 --> 17:51.744
And that means that Evan will

17:51.745 --> 17:54.448
have to stay with me
more often. How's that?

17:54.449 --> 17:56.158
Mom, put down the knife.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.526
Put down the knife and listen to me.

17:58.527 --> 18:06.306
If Robert gets this job,
whatever this job is, then... yes,

18:06.307 --> 18:10.041
we've agreed that Washington
should be our home base.

18:10.042 --> 18:12.687
I mean, it's not gonna
be easy for me either.

18:12.688 --> 18:14.573
But it's the right thing to do.

18:14.574 --> 18:16.448
Okay.

18:16.449 --> 18:19.046
Okay.

18:19.047 --> 18:21.114
Mom, did you just hear what she said?

18:21.115 --> 18:24.160
Yes. Yes, I heard what she said.

18:24.161 --> 18:25.457
Mom, what's wrong with you?

18:25.458 --> 18:28.230
Robert and Kitty might move to Washington

18:28.231 --> 18:29.865
and take your grandson with them.

18:29.866 --> 18:33.860
Our family business is about
to be sold off for a fire sale,

18:33.861 --> 18:35.576
and I don't seem to be able to stop it.

18:35.577 --> 18:37.194
The man I love is going to France.

18:37.195 --> 18:40.076
I don't know if he's ever
coming back. And guess what, mom.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.052
Your son is not coming to dinner tonight.

18:42.053 --> 18:45.054
So for God sake, would you
just stop chopping the carrots?

18:45.055 --> 18:47.335
Carrots are not important right now.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.824
I just remembered.

18:55.825 --> 18:57.687
I have something I need to do upstairs.

18:57.688 --> 18:58.860
I'll be back.

19:01.112 --> 19:03.621
Well, call me as soon
as you hear anything.

19:03.622 --> 19:06.376
Yeah. You... you have
my cell number, right?

19:06.377 --> 19:11.210
No, I understand, but patience
isn't an option for me right now.

19:13.876 --> 19:16.335
It's like watching paint dry,

19:16.336 --> 19:19.065
- waiting for this geological report.
- Here's the thing...

19:19.066 --> 19:21.734
I just got a thank-you call
from Ardilla and Company.

19:21.735 --> 19:24.696
It appears that we are no longer
behind in our shipping invoices.

19:25.067 --> 19:26.042
- What?
- Yeah.

19:26.043 --> 19:28.622
- Well, where'd they get the money?
- Holly, come on.

19:28.623 --> 19:32.292
Oh, God. You... you don't think she...

19:38.202 --> 19:39.605
Oh, my God.

19:39.606 --> 19:45.647
Rebecca transferred $2 million
into Ojai's cash account.

19:45.648 --> 19:47.248
- Damn it.
- What are you doing?

19:47.249 --> 19:49.126
Holly, come on. We
need to talk about this.

19:49.127 --> 19:51.070
No, there's nothing to talk about.

19:55.448 --> 19:58.093
It feels like you killed the tooth fairy.

19:58.094 --> 20:00.505
Well, it seemed like a
good idea at the time.

20:00.506 --> 20:03.353
I leave for ten minutes
to get macadamia nuts,

20:03.354 --> 20:05.816
and it's like you take
away her will to live.

20:05.817 --> 20:08.180
Do you think she's ever
gonna come downstairs again?

20:08.181 --> 20:11.292
- Maybe actual we leave...
- Well, not without a drink. Open that up.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.661
You know, there is an argument to make

20:14.662 --> 20:17.649
that forcing somebody to
see the truth of their lives,

20:17.650 --> 20:20.339
no matter how bleak, is... is good.

20:20.340 --> 20:21.809
Make it.

20:21.810 --> 20:24.287
I'll get the wine glasses.

20:24.288 --> 20:26.627
Sarah, put that down.

20:26.628 --> 20:29.462
No one is allowed to drink my wine
until everything is in the oven.

20:29.463 --> 20:31.419
Right now we're behind schedule.

20:31.420 --> 20:34.969
And, Sarah, you're wrong.
You have to care about the carrots.

20:34.970 --> 20:39.010
It's the carrots and onions
and celery that ground us.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.910
Nothing is more basic than that.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.910
When the whole world is
shifting and changing,

20:42.940 --> 20:44.910
you've gotta hold on to your carrots.

20:44.950 --> 20:46.610
Right now, I'm gonna chop these,

20:46.650 --> 20:48.230
and nothing on earth is gonna stop me.

20:48.231 --> 20:51.900
And if you don't want to
help me, get out of my way.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.850
Girls, in or out?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.820
Okay, mom. I'll live in
your fantasy for a while.

20:58.850 --> 21:02.320
- It sure beats my reality hands down.
- Yeah.

21:02.350 --> 21:04.320
Reality is all perception anyway.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.290
And I'm... I'm in.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.960
Open the booze.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.960
You need to relax.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.970
- He can't think this is an ambush.
- The guy's a lying lowlife.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.470
- Who cares?
- Justin, watch the attitude.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.779
We need a deal not a fistfight.

21:18.780 --> 21:19.850
Well, look, if you were in legal circles,

21:19.851 --> 21:23.140
- I was known as "the greaser."
- They called you that to your face?

21:23.170 --> 21:25.140
God, no. Lawyers aren't
great with nicknames.

21:25.180 --> 21:26.059
The point is, when a deal got hung up,

21:26.060 --> 21:28.530
I'd be called in to smooth
it out and make it work.

21:28.560 --> 21:29.670
Maybe when you didn't have a

21:29.671 --> 21:32.849
- personal grudge going in.
- That's when I was at my best.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.310
Fine. Be the greaser.

21:34.350 --> 21:36.350
I will.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.650
What is this, an ambush?

21:38.690 --> 21:41.190
Mr. York. Hi, I'm Kevin Walker.

21:41.220 --> 21:44.760
I know who you are. I've known
you since the day you were born.

21:44.790 --> 21:47.930
I just didn't expect to
see you here. That's all.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.660
I bet.

21:54.690 --> 21:56.660
Your father was a shrewd businessman.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.660
He and I hatched a lot
of plans in this room.

21:59.690 --> 22:01.690
Ah, if these walls could talk.

22:01.730 --> 22:04.600
If they could talk, he
would've followed me to prison.

22:04.630 --> 22:07.270
Tell me why we're here. I
thought we already had a deal.

22:07.300 --> 22:10.840
Well, the situation's changed since
you spoke with our mother and Holly.

22:10.870 --> 22:13.840
Thank you.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.010
Now we know why Justin's here.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.850
Oh, that's hilarious.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.469
It's interesting to see you here, Kevin.

22:20.470 --> 22:22.780
I know about Aaron Gans if
that's what you're looking for.

22:22.820 --> 22:25.650
Your threats against our
mother didn't work. She's fine.

22:25.690 --> 22:26.749
We're all fine. Thank you.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.620
Is that your way of
telling me the deal is off

22:28.660 --> 22:30.270
or did you just want me to know that

22:30.271 --> 22:34.760
- therapy is doing well?
- It's our way of telling you, you've lost your leverage.

22:35.550 --> 22:37.160
And we're on equal footing with you.

22:37.161 --> 22:39.829
- And why is that?
- Because we're not selling you the company.

22:39.830 --> 22:40.820
That's right.

22:40.821 --> 22:42.930
And you have nothing
left to blackmail us with.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.960
We found Narrow Lake.

22:44.990 --> 22:48.100
Oh. Well, well, well.

22:48.130 --> 22:50.770
Was it worth all the hoo-ha?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.270
Obviously for you, and
eventually we'll find out.

22:53.300 --> 22:56.440
But you could save us
a lot of time and money.

22:56.470 --> 22:59.340
We're willing to offer
you 20% gross profits

22:59.380 --> 23:01.810
based on what the land
will ultimately be worth.

23:01.850 --> 23:03.810
- All we want in exchange...
- In exchange...

23:03.850 --> 23:05.950
Is for me to tell you what it is.

23:05.980 --> 23:08.250
Yeah, and it's a win-win.

23:08.290 --> 23:11.660
Well, let... let's, uh,
let's see how that works.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.360
Let's just say that I'm interested.

23:14.390 --> 23:17.830
Um, 20% seems... well,
it strikes me as low.

23:17.860 --> 23:18.870
That's all right. We're not inflexible.

23:18.871 --> 23:20.840
We could move up maybe two points.

23:20.870 --> 23:22.840
All right, um...

23:24.090 --> 23:26.050
before we go any further with this...

23:26.090 --> 23:28.060
what is it that you want to see...

23:28.090 --> 23:31.060
me walking outta here with
my tail between my legs

23:31.090 --> 23:33.890
after handing you the key to a fortune...

23:33.930 --> 23:35.780
all right, you can walk
out of here anyway you want.

23:35.781 --> 23:39.200
This is a business transaction.
Nothing more, nothing less.

23:39.230 --> 23:41.740
You no longer have the power
to tear our family apart.

23:41.770 --> 23:45.910
Just for the record, I was only a
middle man on that thing with the kid.

23:45.940 --> 23:47.380
Your father called the shots.

23:47.390 --> 23:49.380
I understand you were just his stooge...

23:49.410 --> 23:52.410
- Kevin, Kevin...
- But it was always about William Walker and nothing else.

23:52.450 --> 23:55.180
He sold me out just to protect
himself and his investments.

23:55.220 --> 23:59.050
Your father didn't tell
you because you were weak...

23:59.090 --> 24:02.990
Because you were too fragile, Kevin.

24:03.030 --> 24:05.130
He was afraid you'd fall apart.

24:10.900 --> 24:13.870
Okay, you know what, kids?
I'm not having fun anymore.

24:13.900 --> 24:16.710
Um... the deal is off.

24:16.740 --> 24:20.790
I only came here to see what you
clowns could possibly have to say.

24:20.820 --> 24:24.100
You think that I would buy anything
without knowing the liabilities?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.530
- I know about your debt.
- Then you'd know we were out of it.

24:26.570 --> 24:30.689
For now. So maybe you
don't go broke this week.

24:30.690 --> 24:33.120
It'll happen next month or
maybe six months from now.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.960
The odds are against you.

24:34.990 --> 24:37.990
I'll bet on you to fail.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.400
See you at the fire sale.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.140
What the hell are you doing?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.549
Plumping pillows. What are you doing here?

24:49.550 --> 24:52.480
- I can't believe that you went through with this.
- Oh, tell me about it.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.480
Mom still believes that Kevin is coming.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.950
- So here we are...
- Kevin c... what are you talking about?

24:56.990 --> 24:59.820
- What are you talking about?
- The $2 million.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.830
- What?
- You talked my daughter

25:01.860 --> 25:03.830
into signing all her money over to Ojai.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.830
Holly, I would never do that.

25:05.860 --> 25:09.200
You don't know what I'm talking about?

25:09.230 --> 25:13.759
- No.
- Rebecca transferred all her money
into the accessible accounts.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.069
Half of it is gone already.

25:15.070 --> 25:17.000
Oh, my God. She's trying to buy us time.

25:17.030 --> 25:19.570
- Hello.
- What, she... she's hiding out here?

25:19.600 --> 25:21.999
Rebecca, I can't believe that
you transferred all your money...

25:22.000 --> 25:23.640
Mom, not now. I've got
the geological survey.

25:23.670 --> 25:25.440
- It came through?
- Yeah.

25:25.470 --> 25:26.679
- Let's look at it. Okay, okay.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.180
- Calm down.
- We have to read it first.

25:28.210 --> 25:30.950
- Let's look at it here. Okay, wait.
- What's the wireless password?

25:30.980 --> 25:33.380
- Uh... "William."
- Mom, you really should change that.

25:33.410 --> 25:35.920
All right. Well, whatever. Okay.

25:35.950 --> 25:37.520
Oh, my God. There it is. 14 pages?

25:37.550 --> 25:39.520
- 14 pages?
- Uh, e-mail it to me.

25:39.550 --> 25:41.390
I'll print it up in my office.

25:41.420 --> 25:43.320
- Okay, I'm gonna get my glasses.
- Open the first page.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.890
Okay.

25:44.930 --> 25:49.130
Okay, Scotty, I'm not exactly
a... a... a cake person,

25:49.160 --> 25:51.670
but... but aren't you using
excessive force with...

25:51.700 --> 25:53.090
Whatever that stuff is in the bowl?

25:53.091 --> 25:55.390
No. It's like your mother said,

25:55.460 --> 25:57.930
when the world is shifting,
you hold your ground.

25:57.960 --> 26:03.770
She chops, and I beat butter
and sugar into submission.

26:05.610 --> 26:06.239
Who am I kidding?

26:06.240 --> 26:08.310
I'm totally freaking out
waiting for Michelle's call.

26:08.340 --> 26:10.880
You know, freaking out
is all part of the deal.

26:10.910 --> 26:13.180
And believe me, I know how
hard it is, because I've...

26:13.220 --> 26:14.529
I've been through it.

26:14.530 --> 26:16.180
You know, the first time
when it didn't work out,

26:16.220 --> 26:18.220
I knew we had a second chance.

26:18.250 --> 26:22.260
But this is it. We have no
more embryos and no more money.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.490
What if it doesn't work?

26:24.530 --> 26:26.660
Oh, it will.

26:26.700 --> 26:29.330
Or it won't.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.200
And, you know, whatever happens,

26:31.230 --> 26:33.630
I know that you and
Kevin are gonna be okay.

26:35.670 --> 26:37.670
Oh, oh. Ahh.

26:37.710 --> 26:39.670
Oh, I'm sorry. It's Robert.

26:39.710 --> 26:41.910
Ah.

26:41.940 --> 26:45.180
Hey. How did it go?

26:45.210 --> 26:47.780
Oh. Oh, come on. Come on, Robert.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.480
Please, just... can't you come over here?

26:50.520 --> 26:54.390
No, no, there's... there's, like,
enough food for... for what, 20 people?

26:54.420 --> 26:57.190
No, no. Okay. It's fine. I... I get it.

26:57.230 --> 27:00.160
Robert wants me to go down to his office.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.000
- Is everything okay?
- I don't know,

27:02.030 --> 27:05.670
- but can you tell my mother that... that I had to go?
-  Yeah.

27:05.700 --> 27:10.140
And... I know that the next
phone call is gonna be for you.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.010
And I know that it's gonna be good.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.210
So you need to keep the faith.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.740
Thanks.

27:22.720 --> 27:26.590
"Quaternary sedimentary rock."
There's some of that there.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.339
What is... what is that?
Is that good or bad?

27:28.340 --> 27:30.290
Well, it depends. It can
be good for grape vines,

27:30.330 --> 27:32.760
- but we don't need any of those.
- Well, I called the company,

27:32.800 --> 27:34.760
and they can't walk us
through this until tomorrow.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.270
Well, sadly, I don't
think that it is confusing.

27:37.300 --> 27:40.440
There's no oil, no natural
gas, no gold, no tin.

27:40.470 --> 27:43.910
But there's 14 pages of it.
There's a lot more to consider.

27:43.940 --> 27:45.910
Look right here. "Groundwater indicated."

27:45.940 --> 27:47.410
What... what does that mean?

27:47.440 --> 27:49.750
"Fractured carbonate rock
suggests greater porosity

27:49.780 --> 27:52.520
at depths beyond the
scope of this survey.

27:52.550 --> 27:56.720
Further study employing
electromagnetic induction recommended."

27:56.750 --> 27:57.929
I guess they don't know yet.

27:57.930 --> 27:59.520
- Okay.
- But what... what does that mean...

27:59.560 --> 28:01.220
"electromagnetic induction"?

28:01.260 --> 28:03.260
It's obviously the study
that we did not commission.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.230
Oh, and how much is that gonna cost?

28:05.260 --> 28:08.460
There is nothing here that's
gonna help us. Nothing.

28:08.500 --> 28:09.960
Tommy, hi.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.770
Hey. What's that?

28:11.800 --> 28:13.300
Uh, the geological survey.

28:13.340 --> 28:16.470
Don't get excited. We
don't have good news.

28:16.510 --> 28:18.770
Yeah, me either.

28:18.810 --> 28:21.380
- We just met with York.
- What?

28:21.410 --> 28:23.780
- York... why?
- We tried to make a deal.

28:23.810 --> 28:26.210
But w... we already had a deal.

28:26.250 --> 28:28.620
Yeah, that's what we thought.

28:28.650 --> 28:30.620
Look, he knows Ojai's about to go under.

28:30.650 --> 28:33.090
- He knows about your money.
- What?

28:33.120 --> 28:35.590
And he thinks it's only a
matter of time before we fail.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.600
Yeah, he says he'll be
there to pick up the pieces.

28:38.630 --> 28:40.160
He pulled the offer.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.070
Forget it.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.500
- Forget it. Just...
- Mom.

28:44.540 --> 28:46.000
- No, forget it.
- Mom.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.310
- Holly...
- No, mom, wait.

28:49.340 --> 28:52.640
You said "we" went to make a deal.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.480
Who... who's we?

28:54.510 --> 28:57.620
Yeah, me, Justin and Kevin.
Justin went to see a patient.

28:57.650 --> 29:00.450
- Where's Kevin?
- I don't know.

29:00.490 --> 29:03.760
Is he all right?

29:03.790 --> 29:05.560
No, mom.

29:07.290 --> 29:09.090
He's not coming.

29:11.130 --> 29:15.000
What do you want us to do,
mom? Should we stay or...

29:15.040 --> 29:17.000
No. He's not gonna come.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.610
Just go do whatever it
is you have to do, Sarah.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.840
Thanks, Tommy.

29:32.450 --> 29:33.920
Mom.

29:33.950 --> 29:36.920
What are you doing here?
I don't want to talk.

29:37.060 --> 29:38.560
Well, I'm sorry. You have to.

29:38.630 --> 29:40.550
And you might want to
stop driving like a psycho.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.880
Didn't you hear me honking at you?

29:41.910 --> 29:43.350
You know, Rebecca, this is not funny.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.910
It is the worst-case scenario.

29:46.520 --> 29:51.050
Do you understand that you may never
see a penny of that money again?

29:52.440 --> 29:54.260
I wish I had never accepted it.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.270
Mom, I wanted to do
this. This is my problem.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.190
- It's not your problem.
- You just got married.

29:59.450 --> 30:01.610
You and Justin are
gonna want to have kids,

30:01.680 --> 30:03.740
- you're gonna want to buy things...
- What are you talking about?

30:04.230 --> 30:05.810
The future.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.620
You are gonna look back
and you're gonna think,

30:08.690 --> 30:12.020
how the hell could my mom
have been so irresponsible?

30:12.090 --> 30:13.580
Mom, that is ridiculous.
I'm not 10 years old.

30:13.650 --> 30:15.510
I understand consequences.

30:15.790 --> 30:18.010
If something goes wrong, it
will be my responsibility.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.550
I'm not going to blame you.

30:19.890 --> 30:21.810
If I lose you again...

30:22.570 --> 30:23.700
Mom.

30:31.810 --> 30:34.460
You remember, you used
to hold me like this

30:34.510 --> 30:36.600
and you would tell me that you
would always be there for me?

30:36.690 --> 30:37.310
Right.

30:37.790 --> 30:39.450
Well, now it's my turn to tell you that.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.250
Don't worry.

30:53.690 --> 30:54.820
Guess I missed the party.

30:57.090 --> 30:57.970
I understand.

31:01.970 --> 31:03.480
Do you want me to get the scotch

31:03.600 --> 31:06.200
- or will that be enough?
- Let's see how it goes.

31:10.270 --> 31:13.380
- You know I saw York.
- Yes, I know.

31:14.180 --> 31:15.060
Are you all right?

31:19.400 --> 31:21.000
I don't know how I feel right now.

31:21.610 --> 31:23.020
I was out there driving around,

31:23.670 --> 31:24.860
not knowing where to go.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.450
So what do I do?

31:28.710 --> 31:30.580
I come to the last person I want to see.

31:30.630 --> 31:32.060
So you tell me, what does that say?

31:34.440 --> 31:35.880
I'm gonna ask you something now,

31:35.940 --> 31:37.510
and you have to tell me the truth.

31:41.810 --> 31:43.220
Did dad think I was weak?

31:44.320 --> 31:45.610
Is that why you didn't tell me?

31:48.140 --> 31:49.990
Kevin, you were...

31:52.110 --> 31:53.130
sensitive.

31:54.790 --> 31:56.160
You were...

31:56.570 --> 31:57.670
tender...

31:58.150 --> 31:59.210
Not weak.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.160
I think he was afraid of you.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.370
He...

32:07.440 --> 32:09.410
Never knew who he was,

32:09.470 --> 32:13.750
and you were so there and on the surface,

32:13.870 --> 32:16.970
so ready, willing and
wanting to know yourself.

32:19.530 --> 32:21.470
I didn't know myself, mom.

32:22.790 --> 32:24.740
Do you know why I hit Aaron that night?

32:27.830 --> 32:29.090
Because he tried to kiss me.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.390
And I wanted to kiss him back,

32:32.460 --> 32:34.460
but I was so scared of
the way I was feeling.

32:37.720 --> 32:38.940
I didn't want anyone to know.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.130
I knew.

32:43.310 --> 32:46.510
I knew you were gay.
I think I always knew.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.940
I was just waiting for you to find out.

32:52.850 --> 32:54.840
And then Aaron came along, and...

32:56.000 --> 32:58.550
Your face would light up
when you talked about him,

32:58.620 --> 32:59.790
and you always talked about him.

32:59.830 --> 33:01.250
And I thought you were in love with him.

33:02.830 --> 33:05.150
Is that why you didn't tell me...

33:05.890 --> 33:07.240
'Cause you thought I loved him?

33:08.270 --> 33:09.010
No.

33:11.710 --> 33:13.450
I was afraid for you.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.230
The world was different then.

33:17.290 --> 33:19.040
It was a lot less tolerant and...

33:20.800 --> 33:24.360
I just knew your life would be harder

33:24.460 --> 33:26.180
than your brothers' and sisters'.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.310
I didn't want you to
have to deal with anything

33:29.430 --> 33:31.320
before you were ready to deal with it.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.050
It's funny. We were both
scared of the same thing.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.540
Me.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.640
And we didn't need to be. Look at you.

33:45.670 --> 33:46.340
Don't.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.570
You're so brave.

33:57.980 --> 34:00.690
Thank you for being brave
enough to talk to me tonight.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.280
I wish I had been brave enough

34:07.320 --> 34:09.370
to tell you about Aaron a long time ago.

34:11.690 --> 34:13.090
But I wasn't.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.840
So now what can I do? How can I help you?

34:23.360 --> 34:25.650
It's gonna take a long time
for me to deal with this.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.610
But I want to talk about it.

34:29.409 --> 34:30.159
I do.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.210
Then that's what we'll do. We'll talk.

34:46.290 --> 34:47.280
Sarah.

34:48.550 --> 34:49.270
Hi.

34:49.409 --> 34:51.179
Luc, wh... what are you doing here?

34:51.250 --> 34:53.290
Well, I'm here for Kevin's birthday party.

34:54.010 --> 34:57.139
And I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to torture you with the boxes.

34:57.180 --> 34:59.800
I... I unpacked them all.
Everything is back where it was.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.880
No, listen. You're still leaving.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.920
You're... you're just gonna
have to pack them again.

35:04.990 --> 35:07.700
No. I'm leaving everything here.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.680
When I leave, it's without luggage.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.480
That way I won't have
to bring it all back.

35:12.540 --> 35:14.620
No, Luc, you cannot get on a plane

35:14.790 --> 35:16.650
with a one-way ticket and no luggage.

35:17.140 --> 35:19.080
They're gonna think you're a terrorist.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.550
Not if I buy a round-trip ticket.

35:23.460 --> 35:26.000
Sarah, I'm...

35:26.090 --> 35:28.320
I'm coming home.

35:29.230 --> 35:30.890
Okay?

35:41.400 --> 35:42.190
Hello.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.030
Hey.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.830
Thanks for meeting me at the office.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.270
Well, you're welcome.

35:47.350 --> 35:50.290
Mm. How was Kevin's party?
Was it a complete disaster?

35:50.330 --> 35:54.360
No. No, actually, it was
an incomplete disaster.

35:54.410 --> 35:56.430
What... what exactly are
we doing here, darling?

35:56.470 --> 36:00.470
Are you a... a spy now or
is this a... a covert op?

36:01.700 --> 36:02.910
I didn't get the job.

36:04.920 --> 36:05.780
Sorry.

36:07.620 --> 36:08.780
Oh, that...

36:10.680 --> 36:12.090
I'm really sorry.

36:12.140 --> 36:13.660
I didn't get it because of my heart.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.100
Mm. The arrhythmia.

36:15.660 --> 36:19.100
My resting heart rate
exceeds their criteria.

36:20.710 --> 36:22.640
Is there anything that you can do?

36:22.770 --> 36:23.490
No.

36:24.460 --> 36:26.950
It is what it is. You should answer that.

36:27.260 --> 36:27.990
Oh.

36:29.840 --> 36:30.550
Mm.

36:32.750 --> 36:33.610
Hi, mom.

36:34.730 --> 36:35.380
Mm-hmm.

36:35.910 --> 36:36.610
Really?

36:38.130 --> 36:40.790
Yes, yes, we will. We will try.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.470
Okay. Bye.

36:45.030 --> 36:47.490
- What is it?
- Well, Kevin's at my mom's house.

36:47.570 --> 36:48.890
Apparently, the dinner is back on,

36:48.920 --> 36:50.480
and everybody's going back over there,

36:50.510 --> 36:51.860
but we do not have to go.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.710
- I think that we should just go home.
- No, we should go.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.870
I mean, I don't want to think
about what we didn't get.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.470
I mean, we've got a
lot, and it's just a job.

37:01.530 --> 37:03.690
So let's go and let's be happy.

37:05.930 --> 37:06.840
Okay.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.310
Okay, let's go.

37:08.330 --> 37:10.260
Let's go and...

37:11.260 --> 37:12.400
Be happy.

37:12.470 --> 37:13.250
Yeah.

37:13.910 --> 37:16.000
Here we are.

37:16.770 --> 37:19.770
- I want to make a toast.
- Oh!

37:19.840 --> 37:21.690
Oh, I'm spilling the wine.

37:21.820 --> 37:24.130
Oh, dear. We can't even
hold on to a glass of wine.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.990
Excuse me. We held on to Ojai Foods, huh?

37:26.340 --> 37:28.200
- Not that we wanted to.
- I wanted to.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.680
Well, only after you didn't.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.110
I didn't know that she really wanted to.

37:31.130 --> 37:32.280
No, no, no, I know what it is.

37:32.310 --> 37:33.820
She felt like she had to not want to.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.260
I'm sorry, but I'm not keeping track

37:35.540 --> 37:38.170
of what is "have to"
and what is "want to."

37:38.190 --> 37:40.010
Luc, Luc, Luc, that is a distinction

37:40.050 --> 37:42.700
that no one at this dinner
party is able to make right now.

37:42.710 --> 37:44.670
Yeah, don't feel bad.
Nobody can keep track.

37:44.710 --> 37:46.490
No. In fact, the logic
is like a race track...

37:46.530 --> 37:49.060
- it just goes round and round.
- And I know where it ends up...

37:49.240 --> 37:50.390
Narrow Lake.

37:50.430 --> 37:51.260
Oh!

37:51.790 --> 37:54.560
It means... Nora Walker!

37:54.640 --> 37:56.680
To Nora Walker!

37:57.050 --> 37:58.520
Oh, wait, wait, wait. While we're up here,

37:58.560 --> 37:59.690
let's make our official toast.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.130
Oh, no, no. Let me, let me, let me.

38:01.160 --> 38:04.250
Everybody... to the
worst birthday of my life.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.810
Cheers! Oh.

38:06.330 --> 38:10.570
No, no, no. To the very
worst investment ever.

38:10.650 --> 38:11.780
Uh-huh. Oh, come on.

38:11.810 --> 38:14.030
There's been worse
investments than Narrow Lake.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.820
Nothing is worse than Narrow Lake.

38:16.850 --> 38:18.690
- Oh, no. I bet you I could beat it.
- All right.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.150
Okay, the love of my life
is going back to France,

38:21.230 --> 38:23.400
and he may never, ever
be able to come back.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.160
That's bad, however, I...

38:25.200 --> 38:28.820
I can top that. I can top
that. I'm 70 years old, right?

38:28.950 --> 38:30.070
- Looking good.
- Okay, I come out of the closet.

38:30.330 --> 38:30.910
- Yeah.
- You did.

38:31.170 --> 38:33.070
I might as well turn
around and go right back in.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.060
Oh. You should. You got
some great clothes in there.

38:38.900 --> 38:42.060
Oh, wait, wait. Scotty has
made the most beautiful cake.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.020
Let's get the cake.

38:43.110 --> 38:44.610
Let's eat the cake! Yeah! Cake!

38:44.720 --> 38:47.160
- Cake! Cake! Cake!
- We only just started eating.

38:47.180 --> 38:49.320
Cake! Cake! Cake!

38:49.380 --> 38:50.450
Why are we having cake now?

38:51.440 --> 38:52.050
What's up?

38:53.130 --> 38:53.950
It's Michelle.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.170
Hey.

38:58.190 --> 39:01.300
- Hey, mom.
- Justin, I'm so glad you're here.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.700
Mom, look, I need you to
listen to me real quick.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.070
So you're... you're completely
right in having this party.

39:05.170 --> 39:07.030
- You have to fix this with Kevin. It's...
- Justin,

39:07.060 --> 39:08.350
You know what? You know what? I have.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.120
- Where's Scotty?
- Look who's here.

39:11.930 --> 39:13.330
- Did Michelle call you, too?
- Yes.

39:13.460 --> 39:15.610
I mean, she still has to
have another blood test.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.800
Right, she has to wait to
see if her HCG doubles.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.920
Right, but... halfway pregnant?

39:20.820 --> 39:21.950
So we can be happy?

39:22.380 --> 39:24.470
- Halfway happy?
- All the way happy?

39:24.560 --> 39:27.030
All the way happy.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.440
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

39:28.460 --> 39:30.100
- Does that mean it worked, mom?
- I don't know.

39:30.190 --> 39:32.490
- I don't... I'm gonna say yes.
- Yes. Well, what do we do?

39:32.530 --> 39:33.880
- We light the candles.
- Light the candles.

39:33.890 --> 39:35.190
- Get the candles.
- Are you freaking out?

39:35.330 --> 39:39.270
- Oh! Kevin!
- Okay, we just heard

39:39.290 --> 39:41.330
- that you were pregnant out there.
- Halfway pregnant.

39:41.360 --> 39:44.170
Wait, guys, you can't be halfway pregnant.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.090
No, no, no, you can, you can.
You have to have a blood test,

39:46.100 --> 39:48.660
and then you have to have
another one, just to be sure.

39:48.690 --> 39:50.670
- Oh, come on.
- They're glowing. Look at them. They're beaming.

39:50.700 --> 39:52.289
- Congratulations. Bravo.
- Yeah.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.500
- No congratulations yet.
- Yeah, we can't celebrate.

39:54.520 --> 39:59.880
Oh, yes, we can celebrate,
because it's Kevin's birthday.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.810
Happy birthday, Kev.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.430
Thank you, mom.

40:03.480 --> 40:10.650
Happy birthday to you, 
happy birthday to you, 

40:10.730 --> 40:20.593
