Hold up.

How y'all doing, you good?

There's an ice cream truck

Why don't you go

31:27.015 --> 31:28.886
No, thank you.

You didn't have to come here.
DALLAS:

31:43.114 --> 31:44.618
Look, I want you to know,

31:44.718 --> 31:46.053
whatever you need,
I got you.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.559
Money, time, it's all good.

31:50.262 --> 31:51.665
I'm out, Franklin.

31:51.765 --> 31:53.903
Yeah, like I just said,
take all the time you need.

31:54.003 --> 31:55.907
No, I'm out.

31:56.007 --> 31:58.111
For good.

32:00.550 --> 32:02.520
We had a pact.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.691
- If something happened to one
- (door opens)
of us, the other had to leave.

32:04.791 --> 32:07.296
No questions asked,
no revenge,

32:07.396 --> 32:10.937
just take the kids and go.

(Jerome scoffs)

33:04.578 --> 33:06.715
Last time I saw these...

33:06.815 --> 33:09.186
was after that fight
about the car.

33:09.286 --> 33:12.192
Mama cooked enough
to feed a whole army.

33:12.292 --> 33:13.963
(laughs)

33:14.063 --> 33:17.236
what we pass on to our kids.
It's amazing

33:17.336 --> 33:20.108
I know she was furious
about him not telling her

33:20.208 --> 33:22.112
he bought it.

33:22.212 --> 33:24.016
But I swear...

33:24.116 --> 33:26.487
like he was ten feet tall
Daddy looked

33:26.588 --> 33:29.026
when he stepped out
that Cadillac.

33:30.730 --> 33:33.268
That's how you remember it?

33:35.338 --> 33:38.044
What you want from me, Cissy?

33:41.284 --> 33:43.756
the last two men standing.
You and Franklin are

33:45.726 --> 33:47.329
Last of the tribe.

33:47.429 --> 33:49.601
Cissy, the boy stole from me.

33:49.701 --> 33:51.705
Pulled a gun on my wife.

33:51.805 --> 33:53.676
Dropped four bodies
outside my club.

33:53.776 --> 33:56.013
He turned you into
a drug dealer.

33:56.648 --> 33:58.686
But
you don't want to
desert him.

33:58.786 --> 34:02.594
Cissy, when you ever had my
back the way you have his?

34:02.694 --> 34:05.065
You're right, maybe I haven't.

34:05.165 --> 34:06.434
Why we're here.

34:06.535 --> 34:09.139
And it might not be fair...

34:10.610 --> 34:12.714
...but it is all on you.

34:13.381 --> 34:17.155
You
are my family,
and I need you.

34:17.757 --> 34:20.462
What are you gonna do?

34:29.681 --> 34:31.217
FRANKLIN: Wait, you did what? We need help.

34:31.317 --> 34:32.687
Yeah, but after everything
you said about her,

34:32.787 --> 34:35.358
I didn't think helping was
something she did.

34:35.458 --> 34:36.828
That money we just laundered,

34:36.929 --> 34:40.235
it was her ex who pointed us
in the right direction.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.306
She made that happen.

34:42.406 --> 34:44.109
She made that happen, huh?

34:48.585 --> 34:52.426
She also took 200 grand off
the mark that put me there.

34:52.527 --> 34:55.231
Look, unless something else
has changed in the past 24 hours

34:55.332 --> 34:58.706
I don't know about, we don't
have a lot of options here.

34:58.806 --> 35:01.578
(sighs) But you can trust her?

35:01.678 --> 35:04.450
I can trust her to be her.

35:04.551 --> 35:07.456
Just sit with her.

35:07.557 --> 35:08.792
Listen to what she has to say.

35:08.892 --> 35:11.865
And if you think she can help,
that's great.

35:12.700 --> 35:15.271

'll send her on her way.
(sighs) If not,

35:17.209 --> 35:18.746
Hmm?

35:22.419 --> 35:24.156
I don't know.

35:27.530 --> 35:29.601
He could've altered
his appearance.

35:38.484 --> 35:41.290
I have no idea.
Never seen him.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.227
Okay.

35:43.328 --> 35:46.702
if you think of anything else.
Keep this copy. Let me know

35:49.373 --> 35:50.442
Okay.

35:50.543 --> 35:52.379
You understand that
whoever this is,

35:52.479 --> 35:53.649
they are out there,

35:53.749 --> 35:55.653
and they're trying to bring

crashing down.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.731
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

36:35.966 --> 36:38.471
Hi, um, can I have a beer, please?

36:38.572 --> 36:40.609

37:07.530 --> 37:08.766
Help yourself.

37:08.866 --> 37:11.671
I'll pass. Thanks.

37:11.772 --> 37:14.511
Do you want a beer?
You seem tense.

37:14.611 --> 37:16.447
I don't drink.

37:16.548 --> 37:18.585
V filled you in, on all of it?

37:18.685 --> 37:20.823
She did.

37:22.527 --> 37:24.731
Oh, thank you.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.972
you brought my daughter into.
Quite an impressive mess

37:29.072 --> 37:31.878
that's what she said about
It's funny, you.

37:31.978 --> 37:33.347
Mm.

37:33.448 --> 37:37.022
to force her back to me.
And yet, you managed

37:38.892 --> 37:40.930
V seems to think you can help.

37:41.030 --> 37:43.535
But you're unconvinced.

37:43.635 --> 37:45.806
Man we're up
against is no joke.

37:45.906 --> 37:48.579
smart, manipulative.
He's trained,

37:48.679 --> 37:51.417

a killer.

37:51.518 --> 37:53.822

37:53.922 --> 37:56.728
So, let's get one thing
straight from the jump.

37:56.828 --> 37:59.433
This works, my fee is 20%.

37:59.534 --> 38:01.036

38:01.137 --> 38:03.307
You'd rather have
100% of nothing?

38:03.407 --> 38:05.513
Yeah, I knew this was
a bad idea.

38:05.613 --> 38:07.783
Wait.

38:09.386 --> 38:12.058
This man you're up against
may be trained,

38:12.159 --> 38:13.127
a killer,

38:13.227 --> 38:15.365
but the person who helped him
steal your money

38:15.465 --> 38:17.637
most likely isn't.

38:17.737 --> 38:18.906
What makes you think
he had help?

38:19.006 --> 38:20.976
he definitely had help.
Oh, honey,

38:21.076 --> 38:22.880
And he wouldn't have used
someone in-house,

38:22.980 --> 38:25.786
because the CIA would have to
account for the money.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.894
Got your attention, huh?

38:29.994 --> 38:32.399

38:34.469 --> 38:37.877
No. How would somebody

Well, lifting that much
from overseas banks,

38:40.983 --> 38:42.887
you need to set up

44:17.422 --> 44:20.094
- MAN: Taste this shit!
- Shit.

44:20.194 --> 44:22.198
(man cackles)

44:22.298 --> 44:24.670
(dog barking in distance)

44:27.275 --> 44:29.680
(indistinct chatter nearby)

44:44.911 --> 44:47.115
(dogs barking in distance)

45:10.328 --> 45:13.167
(siren wailing in distance)

45:21.483 --> 45:23.888
- (bell dings)
- (busy chatter)

45:34.777 --> 45:36.748
(bell dings)

45:43.360 --> 45:45.464
You want something?

45:45.565 --> 45:47.736
I'm a'ight.

45:52.846 --> 45:55.184
Ain't got to worry.

45:55.284 --> 45:56.921
Cissy wanted me to come here
and talk.

45:57.021 --> 45:58.925
Let's talk.

46:00.328 --> 46:02.298
All right.

46:03.969 --> 46:06.440
The way I see it, you know,
shit's pretty simple.

46:06.541 --> 46:10.448
Yeah. I hit you. You hit me.

46:11.951 --> 46:13.922
Let's just call it square.

46:14.022 --> 46:17.028
Stay out of each other's way,

46:17.128 --> 46:19.500
everybody lives.

46:20.401 --> 46:22.205
Call it square?

46:22.305 --> 46:24.175
Uh-huh.

46:27.015 --> 46:29.954
when I first came to L. A.?
I ever tell you about

46:31.591 --> 46:32.860
I don't know.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.462
Couldn't get my mind right
back in Texas.

46:34.563 --> 46:37.068
Place wouldn't
have fit no more.

46:37.168 --> 46:40.241
Cissy was moving
to the West Coast,

46:40.341 --> 46:42.345
landed in the Bay.

46:42.445 --> 46:45.184
I knew that peace, love,
hippie shit wasn't for me.

46:47.155 --> 46:48.457
L.A. sounded a'ight.

46:48.558 --> 46:52.065
I realized the mistake.
Minute I got here,

46:52.165 --> 46:54.537
I ain't had no people here.

46:54.637 --> 46:56.974
No way to fit in.

46:58.444 --> 47:01.551
But I wasn't gonna run
back home, stuck it out.

47:01.651 --> 47:04.022
Got a job at the
Chrysler plant.

47:04.122 --> 47:05.992
Went out every night.

47:06.093 --> 47:07.830
Pussy ain't help.

47:08.865 --> 47:11.971
Liquor and drink did a little.

47:12.071 --> 47:13.474
No matter what I threw at it,

47:13.575 --> 47:17.215
the big hole inside me
just kept getting bigger.

47:19.486 --> 47:22.358
Then Alton fell off.

47:22.458 --> 47:25.031
Panthers shit.

47:25.131 --> 47:27.503
Drinking.

47:27.603 --> 47:31.276
Cissy trying to save his ass
while trying to raise yours.

47:33.113 --> 47:34.315
She was drowning.

47:34.416 --> 47:36.453
So I told her to
come out here.

47:36.554 --> 47:38.057
Told her I'd set her up.

47:38.157 --> 47:41.531
Be whatever she
needed me to be.

47:41.631 --> 47:43.033
She came.

47:43.133 --> 47:45.572
Suddenly you was here.

47:45.672 --> 47:49.880
Instantly I had love,
I had purpose.

47:50.682 --> 47:53.120
the man that raised you.
I was gonna be

47:53.220 --> 47:57.028
For the longest time, I
thought that by lifting you up...

48:00.000 --> 48:03.908
...watching the young man
that you were gonna become,

48:04.008 --> 48:06.179
that that may be
the greatest thing

48:06.279 --> 48:08.016
to ever happen in my life.

48:08.117 --> 48:10.421
And now I look at you...

48:12.258 --> 48:17.068
...and I wonder how the--
how did I fuck up so bad?

48:17.168 --> 48:19.305
Is it my fault

48:19.406 --> 48:22.579
a scandalous, cutthroat,
that you've become

48:22.679 --> 48:26.587
that you are right now?
bitch-made nigga

48:28.525 --> 48:30.060
That's how you see it?

48:30.161 --> 48:32.031
That's what the
fuck it is, man.

48:32.131 --> 48:33.968
(scoffs)

48:34.804 --> 48:38.611
Well, uh, you kn
ow, I guess
another way of seeing it is

48:38.711 --> 48:41.082
everything you have
is because of me.

48:41.183 --> 48:43.253
Right?

48:43.353 --> 48:46.226
What I got? Hmm?

48:46.326 --> 48:49.099
What I got, nephew?

48:49.199 --> 48:51.203
Blood money?

48:51.303 --> 48:53.373
Bodies on me?

48:53.474 --> 48:56.313
Cops and CIA on my ass?

48:57.381 --> 48:59.486
Your mama losing
her goddamn mind?

48:59.587 --> 49:01.356
You was going nowhere,
doing nothing,

49:01.456 --> 49:03.093
selling dime bags
on the porch,

49:03.193 --> 49:05.966
waiting for your bitch to come down from that sherm.

49:06.066 --> 49:07.669
I'll crack your motherfucking jaw.

49:07.769 --> 49:09.974
I tried to give you a legacy,

49:10.074 --> 49:12.980
something more than asubwoofer and a weight bench.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.517
And if you hadn't let yourself
get played

49:14.617 --> 49:15.685
by that trick you married,
you might've had it!

49:15.785 --> 49:18.357
Fuck you think you're talking to?

49:18.457 --> 49:19.927
Y-You ever lay...

49:20.027 --> 49:22.331
- Nigga, you ain't gonna do
- (gasping)
shit!

49:22.431 --> 49:24.637
I ain't gonna
fucking do shit?!

49:26.039 --> 49:27.943
(War's "Slippin' Into
Darkness" playing)

49:28.043 --> 49:29.547
Do it.

49:31.016 --> 49:33.120
Pull it, nigga.

49:33.220 --> 49:34.557
Kill me.

49:34.657 --> 49:36.994
End this shit right now.

49:37.094 --> 49:38.998
Do it!
