WEBVTT

00:09.843 --> 00:11.720
Phoenix <i>Control, this is Hopper 4.</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:14.890
<i>We have a nice, clean separation,
and we're out of docking zone.</i>

00:14.890 --> 00:17.226
<i>Roger, 4. Clear and clean separation.</i>

00:17.226 --> 00:18.852
<i>You are clear of docking zone.</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:21.063
<i>Sorry for the late departure.</i>

00:21.063 --> 00:24.483
<i>Tighten your straps and enjoy the zero-G
while you can.</i>

00:41.333 --> 00:43.794
Look. You can still see the <i>Sojourner 1</i>

00:43.794 --> 00:45.254
over there off in the distance.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.538
<i>Welcome to Happy Valley.</i>

01:19.538 --> 01:21.081
<i>Thank you, Control.</i>

01:25.711 --> 01:28.172
<i>Rover 7, this is Rover 1, Control.</i>

01:28.172 --> 01:30.924
<i>Control, this is 73555.</i>

01:30.924 --> 01:34.636
<i>I'm inbound with passengers
and cargo from Hopper 4 on pad 3.</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:38.515
<i>Copy that, Rover 7.
Let's put you at port 2 air lock.</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:40.684
<i>Thank you, Control. Go for port 2.</i>

01:43.103 --> 01:45.772
<i>All you one-eighteens, on me. Do it now.</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:49.193
I repeat, all one-eighteens, on me.

01:49.818 --> 01:54.448
The day is 2.75% longer here,
but that does not mean we can drag ass.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.744
My name is Palmer James, and I am
director of Helios Human Services.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.621
I work directly under the XO--

02:00.621 --> 02:05.709
that's executive officer to you--
Ed Baldwin, Old Man Mars himself.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.002
If you got a problem
with your work detail,

02:08.002 --> 02:09.795
your rations, your paycheck,

02:09.795 --> 02:10.964
you come and see me.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.550
Because for the next two years
of your life,

02:13.550 --> 02:15.886
you'll be dealing
with freezing sandstorms,

02:15.886 --> 02:19.515
dust devils, weak-ass sun, and radiation.

02:19.515 --> 02:23.018
The water tastes like piss
because it literally is recycled piss.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.020
The air outside will kill you.

02:25.020 --> 02:29.441
And after 710 sols looking at the same
damn faces over and over again,

02:30.025 --> 02:31.735
you might think that's a blessing.

02:32.778 --> 02:36.490
First, you're all gonna grab a SMIGI,

02:37.032 --> 02:40.118
Standard Mars Initial Gear Issue.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.956
It contains everything you need to begin
your career as a Red Dirt Marzie,

02:44.498 --> 02:47.626
including a watch
that operates on Mars time.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.129
Don't worry about the color
of your sheets and towels.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.382
Base laundry's irradiated
the hell out of 'em,

02:53.382 --> 02:56.301
so you won't get the previous owner's
clap or foot fungus.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.763
Plenty of that to be had for yourself
though, so I'd make hygiene a priority.

02:59.763 --> 03:04.768
You can purchase snacks and sandwiches
at any machine like this one.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.437
If you're of the cold-hard-cash
persuasion,

03:07.437 --> 03:08.981
you can use base scrip,

03:08.981 --> 03:11.942
available at several locations
marked on your site map.

03:12.985 --> 03:13.986
Follow me.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.036
Hey, Dale. Not so fast.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.205
You rack downstairs. This way.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.784
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, Bob.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.495
Yeah.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.082
You couldn't stay away, huh?

05:32.082 --> 05:35.085
Yeah. I guess I'm a real glutton
for punishment.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.753
That's gotta be it.

05:39.715 --> 05:40.549
"GK."

05:42.509 --> 05:43.510
For Grigory.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.805
I keep expecting him
to just come around the corner

05:46.805 --> 05:49.016
with that big old shit-eating grin of his.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.811
Yeah. Yeah, he would've been
so happy seeing you back up here.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.439
Yeah.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.066
Hey. Let me show you around.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.235
Right. Okay.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.283
I got all key department heads from Helios
and the M-7

06:06.283 --> 06:08.076
waiting for you in the conference room.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.954
Thought afterwards, we could
get a little grub in the commissary.

06:11.455 --> 06:15.709
Conference room? Commissary?
What else y'all got, a nightclub up here?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.128
No, not yet. But we do have an apple tree.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.215
I see that. She bear any fruit yet?

06:21.215 --> 06:22.966
Not yet. Maybe in a couple years.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.303
But she's growing a hell of a lot faster
than we thought she would up here.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.389
Now, I know that ain't who I think it is.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.851
Lee? Hey!

06:34.478 --> 06:35.979
Lee! Lee!

06:39.024 --> 06:42.486
Hey. How you doing, man?
I heard you came back up here.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.615
Comrade Lee Jung-Gil, act properly.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.285
Yes, I understand.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.287
Nice to see you.

06:56.792 --> 06:57.960
What's going on with him?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.419
He's just being careful.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.548
He's got a lot of eyes on him
since he came back up here,

07:02.548 --> 07:05.092
and the North Koreans are making sure
he knows his place.

07:06.051 --> 07:09.179
Okay, team, where are we?

07:10.889 --> 07:12.724
Section two, sublevel three.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.227
- Good. Out of how many levels?
- Five.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.895
Gold star for you, Rich.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.399
Bottom two are still under construction,
so they're off-limits.

07:20.983 --> 07:21.984
Come on.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.196
Always keep an eye out
for the location of emergency equipment,

07:26.196 --> 07:28.365
quick-patch, and oxygen gear.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.869
They are not always located
where they're marked on the site map.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.453
Is that the North Korean compound?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.498
As Carnac the Magnificent
over here just pointed out,

07:36.498 --> 07:39.543
this is where
our North Korean crewmates bunk down.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.503
Etch this behind your eyeballs:

07:41.503 --> 07:45.507
Rule number one,
nobody tries to go in there.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.342
- Clear?
- Clear.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.513
Moving on.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.018
Dale, this is your new home.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.856
There's your work order.
It says who you report to, when and where.

08:00.856 --> 08:04.484
I think there's some kind of mistake.
This says I'm doing base maintenance,

08:04.484 --> 08:05.986
but I was trained as a fuel tech.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.155
Well,
the asteroid program's been put on hold,

08:08.155 --> 08:09.740
so the brain trust has decreed

08:09.740 --> 08:12.409
that fuel production
is no longer mission-essential.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.620
What is base maintenance?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.456
With your obvious quals, you'll be working
maintenance on environmental units.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.458
- HVAC?
- More or less.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.962
'Cause I thought
I was gonna be working on the surface.

08:24.588 --> 08:25.589
Have a nice sol.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.759
The rest of you ducklings, follow me.

08:43.941 --> 08:47.653
Hey. How y'all doing? I'm Miles Dale.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.488
- Welcome.
- Hi.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.410
- Hey there. I'm Gerardo.
- Hey.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.957
Hey, which bunk should I use?

08:59.957 --> 09:01.250
Top bunk. There.

09:17.766 --> 09:21.562
Listen, if you cannot find anything
you need at the PX,

09:22.145 --> 09:24.314
like booze, laser disc,

09:24.314 --> 09:25.941
- <i>Playboy</i> magazines...
- Huh.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.818
...talk to me. Ilya.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.779
I'll get it for you for a good price.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.699
I'm good for right now, but sure.

09:33.699 --> 09:34.783
Okay.

09:37.119 --> 09:40.998
- Jerry, are you good? You need anything?
- I'm fine.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.082
Okay.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.855
Everyone, please take your seats.

10:11.904 --> 10:16.950
A couple months ago,
this base experienced a terrible loss.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.162
I know it still hurts.

10:21.997 --> 10:27.753
Grigory Kuznetsov-- Kuz--
he was a friend of mine.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.173
And when we were up here
for more than a year,

10:31.173 --> 10:34.510
slowly running out of food,
he never wavered.

10:35.177 --> 10:39.097
In fact,
he came back up to Mars two years later

10:39.598 --> 10:41.558
because he wanted
to keep building something.

10:42.434 --> 10:46.605
The last thing he would want is for his
sacrifice to wind up being for nothing.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.323
The last time I was up here,

10:56.323 --> 10:59.451
this whole place wasn't nothing
but a couple of hallways.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.620
But we were in it together.

11:02.621 --> 11:07.084
NASA, Russia, Helios, North Korea.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.880
So I'm gonna need the help of each
and every one of you

11:11.880 --> 11:13.799
while we figure this thing out together.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.093
Under my command,

11:16.093 --> 11:19.638
there will never be a penalty
for speaking the truth.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.225
We need to learn from our past,

11:24.184 --> 11:27.729
all the while keeping our eyes focused
on what's ahead.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.659
All right. Let's get to work.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.832
What the hell are you--

12:30.125 --> 12:33.045
Jesus. You scared me.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.088
I scared you?

12:36.006 --> 12:39.009
I get woken up by weird noises,
and you're not in bed.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.302
What are you even doing?

12:42.804 --> 12:46.225
- The TV wasn't working.
- So you took the whole thing apart?

12:47.434 --> 12:50.062
Aleida, it's 3:30 in the fucking morning.
This has to stop.

12:51.313 --> 12:54.733
All right? Just moping around,
watching TV, playing <i>Guitar Hero</i>.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.403
Baby, you haven't been to work in months.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.156
You barely leave the house anymore.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.371
Look, I know
you're going through a rough time,

13:07.913 --> 13:12.125
but this shit's--
it's beginning to affect the kids.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.763
What do you suggest I do?

13:25.514 --> 13:27.599
- I think you should go back to Lara.
- No.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.269
No more pills.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.731
No more talking about my trauma
while she takes her little notes and goes...

13:36.066 --> 13:39.903
Okay, then go back to NASA
and tell them you want your job back.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.780
I can't go back.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.201
Great. Then, you know what?
I got a better idea.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.953
Why don't you just hide here
from the world,

13:47.953 --> 13:50.706
fix TVs at 3:30 in the morning?
'Cause that's totally normal.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.145
<i>...hit record.</i>

14:16.064 --> 14:18.442
- <i>You made it.</i>
- <i>You're on Mars, Dad--</i>

14:19.067 --> 14:20.527
<i>...Mars, Dad-- Da--</i>

14:26.992 --> 14:29.620
Oh, no, don't do that. Shi-- God's sake.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.496
Hey, man, could you help me out with this?

14:31.496 --> 14:33.373
I'm trying to get this vidmail to load
from my family.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.418
It's been a few days
and this fucking thing still won't work.

14:36.418 --> 14:37.503
Sorry, brother.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.171
Bandwidth's for shit.

14:39.171 --> 14:43.300
Nobody downstairs has been getting d-mail,
vidmail, anything for weeks.

14:45.344 --> 14:46.970
You serious? That's fucking bullshit.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.847
Welcome to Happy Valley.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.919
<i>And Lexie got into
the gifted and talented program.</i>

17:23.919 --> 17:25.378
<i>Isn't that fantastic?</i>

17:25.378 --> 17:29.508
<i>So she's gonna be sending you messages
for help with her calculus.</i>

17:30.551 --> 17:33.262
<i>And James is very excited.</i>

17:33.262 --> 17:35.597
<i>He just got a bala shark
for his fish tank.</i>

17:35.597 --> 17:38.475
<i>It's not a real shark. Don't worry.
The guy at the store says it's more like...</i>

17:38.475 --> 17:40.978
Hey, take a look at the sink
while you're here. It's not draining.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.146
- That's not really my--
- Thank you.

17:43.146 --> 17:47.192
<i>And he's been cleaning the filter
every Saturday, just like you showed him.</i>

17:49.444 --> 17:51.071
<i>You'd be so proud.</i>

18:12.551 --> 18:16.263
So this red splotch here is
where it's detecting methane gas?

18:16.263 --> 18:18.891
Correct.
Methane's a sign of possible life.

18:18.891 --> 18:22.519
And these northern regions of Mars
are riddled with these lava tubes

18:22.519 --> 18:24.146
like you're simulating here?

18:24.146 --> 18:27.232
That's right. Korolev Crater
is one of the most likely places

18:27.232 --> 18:30.485
to harbor microbial life
in the entire solar system.

18:30.485 --> 18:33.614
Honestly, it's amazing what Dev Ayesa's

18:33.614 --> 18:36.408
robotics company has done
with optical miniaturization.

18:36.909 --> 18:40.412
Spot, our robot, has found six
of the eight microbe colonies

18:40.412 --> 18:41.830
we've hidden in this test tunnel.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.750
That's very, very impressive.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.169
You're doing remarkable work here.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.921
It's been a real team effort.

18:51.048 --> 18:53.675
- Could I... Great.
- Sure.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.891
Kelly, I don't have to tell you
that there have been tremendous ripples

19:00.891 --> 19:02.351
from the asteroid disaster,

19:02.351 --> 19:03.936
and the president has ordered me

19:03.936 --> 19:07.231
to commit all of our resources
to righting that project.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.983
And unfortunately,
that means we're gonna have to delay

19:09.983 --> 19:12.069
some of our science objectives
a little bit.

19:13.570 --> 19:16.657
- Delay? What does that--
- It's only temporary.

19:16.657 --> 19:19.409
Look, I know the work
you're doing here is very important,

19:19.409 --> 19:22.704
but right now everything at NASA hinges

19:22.704 --> 19:25.374
on getting the
Asteroid Capture Program back up.

19:25.374 --> 19:28.418
'Cause if we don't get that to
start paying major dividends

19:28.418 --> 19:33.090
and soon, we are just not gonna be
able to afford research like yours.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.050
Right.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.469
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.012
Very true.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.982
That fettucine smells amazing.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.068
I can't believe pasta's
actually made up here.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.156
Horticulture's made some big
advancements past few years.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.075
We're growing almost three-quarters
our food up here now.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.994
- I'll have the pasta as well.
- Sure.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.913
So how'd Kelly take it...

20:04.913 --> 20:06.999
- Here you go.
- ...you staying up here again?

20:07.499 --> 20:11.295
Well, she hasn't actually responded
since I told her.

20:12.462 --> 20:16.049
I'm sorry to hear that, Ed,
but I gotta tell you I don't blame her.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.177
You've been putting it off
for eight years.

20:18.177 --> 20:19.469
Can't stay up here forever.

20:19.469 --> 20:22.097
Just wanted to make sure that
you got off on the right foot.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.433
Don't be trying to put this off on me.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.784
Does this look like meat loaf to you?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.288
- No.
- Yeah.

20:46.288 --> 20:50.417
I wanna say you get used to it,
but you really don't.

20:52.044 --> 20:55.088
You know, in training,
they said that we had a chef up here.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.757
Well, yeah, up there.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.593
But comcards only work
on the level you rack on.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.554
They say it's to prevent
any one mess from getting slammed,

21:02.554 --> 21:05.682
but I'll tell you right now, they just
don't wanna share all the good grub.

21:05.682 --> 21:09.853
Yeah, but isn't that kind of what
being on Mars is all about?

21:10.729 --> 21:12.898
I mean, ever since
the first Martian Thanksgiving.

21:12.898 --> 21:15.442
I mean, sharing,
sacrificing for one another.

21:16.568 --> 21:19.071
So you saw the Disney movie. Okay.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.864
Here's our reality:

21:22.366 --> 21:26.620
Astronauts and cosmonauts, scientists
and pilots, they all work together.

21:26.620 --> 21:31.583
But us down here, at the end of the day,
we are just the help.

21:33.961 --> 21:36.338
I was repairing the sealant
on a guy's air duct today.

21:36.839 --> 21:39.550
I mean, he barely even looked at me,
like I didn't even exist.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.176
That sounds right.

21:41.176 --> 21:43.220
I mean, think about what
happened on <i>Ranger-1</i>, right?

21:44.471 --> 21:47.391
Everybody's wringing their hands
over Kuznetsov dying out there,

21:47.391 --> 21:49.393
wearing those patches
with his initials on them.

21:49.393 --> 21:50.435
Yeah, I saw that.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.229
You know whose initials
aren't on those patches?

21:53.480 --> 21:54.481
Tom Parker's.

21:55.399 --> 21:57.526
Tom Parker's the other guy
who died out there.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.866
- Did you know him?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.075
You're sleeping in his rack.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.539
He and I, we started out at the same time.

22:10.539 --> 22:15.878
He has a-- had a wife
and a kid down in Little Rock.

22:16.795 --> 22:21.758
And I was there.
I was on <i>Ranger-1</i>. I saw him go out.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.470
You were on the capture mission?

22:27.181 --> 22:28.182
Yep.

22:30.058 --> 22:32.769
Well, sounds like he died a real hero.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.354
No.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.399
No, he did it for the bonus.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.277
Money for his family.

22:41.904 --> 22:43.655
And now he's maggot meat.

22:50.871 --> 22:53.957
I walked the base this morning,
just to get a feel for the place,

22:53.957 --> 22:56.793
and I'm getting a sense
of real frustration below deck.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.463
Well, yeah.
Who knew it would be hard living on Mars?

22:59.463 --> 23:01.924
Fuck they think this is,
some luxury cruise liner?

23:01.924 --> 23:03.258
Come on. Give me a break.

23:03.842 --> 23:07.513
When we went to space,
we went for our country, for the mission.

23:07.513 --> 23:09.014
Push the envelope.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.849
These guys, they're just
up here to make a buck.

23:12.059 --> 23:16.480
And that difference, it's what's behind
a lot of these issues that we're having.

23:17.523 --> 23:21.151
Maybe so, Ed,
but I'm just starting to think

23:21.151 --> 23:23.028
that the dysfunction goes a lot deeper.

23:23.612 --> 23:26.031
Take the comms down there, right?

23:26.031 --> 23:28.158
I guess there's some sort
of bandwidth problem.

23:28.659 --> 23:31.286
They haven't been able to get
messages from their families in weeks.

23:31.286 --> 23:35.082
Right. Yeah, we had some relay satellite
that crapped out a couple months ago

23:35.082 --> 23:37.626
and it killed a lot of
our normal communication capacity.

23:37.626 --> 23:40.045
So essential comms take priority.

23:41.713 --> 23:46.635
So, you talking to Kelly
counts as essential comms, is that right?

23:46.635 --> 23:50.055
Come on, Dani. We're doing
the best we can with what we got.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.559
All right? TV's not working
for the same reason.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.144
Okay. So, what are we
going to do to fix it?

23:56.144 --> 23:57.521
We're not.

23:58.730 --> 24:02.693
Helios corporate says the Comsat is
not designed for in-space repairs.

24:02.693 --> 24:05.070
It doesn't have any tether points,
no attachment sockets.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.072
It's way the hell out in geosync orbit.

24:07.072 --> 24:10.158
So they figure we're better off
limping along with what we got

24:10.158 --> 24:12.369
than risking an EVA repair mission.

24:13.745 --> 24:16.248
I mean, there is
a replacement satellite in the pipeline,

24:16.248 --> 24:20.377
but I can't imagine that's
gonna happen until next year.

24:22.004 --> 24:23.130
Next year?

24:24.756 --> 24:29.595
You remember when we were on the
other side of this on Apollo 22, right?

24:29.595 --> 24:33.265
Lot of talk, lot of promises made,
but no follow-through.

24:33.265 --> 24:34.349
Yeah.

24:35.225 --> 24:36.226
"Two more weeks."

24:37.102 --> 24:38.520
- BOHICA.
- BOHICA.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.397
And our morale was in the shitter.

24:41.231 --> 24:43.275
- That's true, but--
- As the commander of Happy Valley,

24:43.275 --> 24:45.152
I am superseding their order.

24:45.944 --> 24:49.781
So, spring a couple of your best
engineers and come up with a fix.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.617
Then we can send up an EVA...

24:52.659 --> 24:53.994
get it repaired right away.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.829
Get that bandwidth back up.

24:55.829 --> 24:57.664
That's not a simple request, Dani.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.958
Well, make it so, XO.

25:04.254 --> 25:06.507
Okay.

25:21.897 --> 25:24.107
Hey, Aleida. Have a seat.

25:25.317 --> 25:28.028
- Thank you for agreeing to see me, sir.
- Of course.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.196
Of course.

25:32.574 --> 25:33.575
How are you?

25:34.326 --> 25:36.161
I'm good. I'm really good.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.579
I'm really glad to hear that.

25:37.579 --> 25:42.334
I just wanted to apologize
for disappearing like that.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.587
I had some family stuff.

25:46.463 --> 25:49.216
I totally understand. Family comes first.

25:49.216 --> 25:53.554
And whenever you're ready to come back,
we will welcome you back with open arms.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.138
I'm ready.

25:55.681 --> 25:57.057
Okay. Well...

26:00.602 --> 26:04.356
as you know, mental health is a top
priority for the president, as well as--

26:04.356 --> 26:07.317
Wasn't really a mental health thing.

26:08.402 --> 26:10.529
Well, you have been through a lot.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.491
I mean, after the bombing and, you know,

26:15.742 --> 26:16.910
recent events,

26:18.245 --> 26:23.125
I just think that it might be a good idea
for you to maybe speak to somebody,

26:23.125 --> 26:25.919
a professional, before you come
back into such a high-stress--

26:25.919 --> 26:28.046
- I'm fine.
- Of course.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.214
Of course, you are.

26:29.214 --> 26:30.299
No, I'm just sa--

26:33.552 --> 26:36.471
You know,
when I first started at Auburn Hills,

26:36.471 --> 26:38.473
I definitely had my struggles too.

26:38.473 --> 26:41.435
I'm still the new guy here
with big shoes to fill.

26:41.977 --> 26:44.813
And I'm no Margo Madison. That's for sure.

26:45.355 --> 26:48.066
But I'm doing the best I can.

26:48.066 --> 26:50.068
If you're ready to come back...

26:59.703 --> 27:00.954
Welcome back.

27:02.456 --> 27:03.582
I made a mistake.

27:05.834 --> 27:06.877
I'm sorry?

27:07.669 --> 27:09.087
I shouldn't have come back here.

27:11.632 --> 27:14.051
Of course you should.
You always have a place here, Aleida.

27:14.051 --> 27:15.427
- No matter wha--
- I'm sorry.

27:15.427 --> 27:17.888
- I quit.
- Now-- Hold on a sec.

27:20.432 --> 27:21.433
Aleida.

27:40.827 --> 27:41.995
Sorry.

27:43.372 --> 27:44.206
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.710
Can I have a shot of Tradicional, please?

27:48.710 --> 27:49.795
- Straight up.
- Sure.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.004
No lime, no salt.

28:00.430 --> 28:01.849
That'll be 6.50.

28:04.893 --> 28:05.894
Here you go.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.614
Kelly Baldwin?

28:19.575 --> 28:20.826
Aleida Rosales.

28:20.826 --> 28:23.412
I was flight director when you--

28:23.412 --> 28:26.373
Blasted off Mars
strapped to the top of an MSAM.

28:26.373 --> 28:30.169
Yeah, I think I'd know the woman
whose brilliant idea that was.

28:30.169 --> 28:32.379
- Sorry about that.
- No, no.

28:32.379 --> 28:35.048
You saved my life and my son's life.

28:35.048 --> 28:36.925
The least I can do is buy you a drink.

28:41.638 --> 28:43.974
You can buy the next one. I'll need it.

28:43.974 --> 28:45.475
One of those days, huh?

28:45.475 --> 28:46.560
Yeah. Pretty much.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.061
Me too.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.150
I haven't been back here
in I don't know how long.

28:54.193 --> 28:55.527
Not since it changed owners.

28:56.820 --> 28:57.905
It's just so...

28:59.740 --> 29:00.782
different.

29:01.700 --> 29:02.701
I know.

29:03.619 --> 29:08.040
But it's practically the only
landmark left from my childhood.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.083
That's right.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.086
Your mom used to own
this place for a while.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.505
Yeah.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.840
I worked here through all of high school.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.469
Used to have spaghetti night
here with my parents every Thursday.

29:23.305 --> 29:26.558
Feels comforting just to be here, I guess.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.519
Especially when life's
kicked you in the guts.

29:30.395 --> 29:31.855
What happened?

29:31.855 --> 29:36.944
Hobson was sorry to inform me he's
delaying my robotics program indefinitely.

29:37.569 --> 29:40.572
All so he can show
the president he's cutting costs.

29:40.572 --> 29:42.699
- Fucker.
- Yeah.

29:42.699 --> 29:45.035
Bastard even tried to
bribe me with a promotion,

29:45.035 --> 29:48.372
which I'll probably wind up
taking 'cause it's the smart move.

29:49.706 --> 29:51.667
Excuse me, two shots, please?

29:51.667 --> 29:53.168
And make hers a double.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.715
Well, what about you?

30:03.470 --> 30:07.307
I can't go home 'cause I don't know
how to tell my husband

30:07.307 --> 30:09.184
we just lost our health insurance.

30:10.686 --> 30:12.020
Wait.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.355
Did Hobson fire you?

30:14.815 --> 30:15.899
I quit.

30:16.483 --> 30:17.568
Why?

30:21.154 --> 30:22.281
I'm not sure.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.579
- Okay.
- Thank you.

30:29.746 --> 30:33.876
To not being sure.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.545
To not being sure.

30:41.842 --> 30:43.969
Here. Lime, lime.

30:44.970 --> 30:46.180
Yeah. That's better.

31:00.903 --> 31:02.070
Goddamn it.

31:02.571 --> 31:03.572
What's up?

31:04.781 --> 31:06.033
First paycheck.

31:06.033 --> 31:07.659
Not what you were expecting, huh?

31:07.659 --> 31:08.744
Not at all.

31:08.744 --> 31:10.537
They're taking 30% off the top.

31:11.121 --> 31:16.376
They're charging me for uniform, food,
clothing-- Jesus Christ-- toothpaste.

31:17.169 --> 31:18.879
I don't know how I'm gonna tell my wife

31:18.879 --> 31:22.508
I came all this way to make less money
than I'm making at home.

31:24.801 --> 31:26.261
I gotta straighten this out.

31:29.389 --> 31:30.599
Good luck with that.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.101
- And?
- And that's not what I was told

31:33.101 --> 31:34.186
it was gonna be.

31:36.522 --> 31:39.066
You think you're the only one smarting, pogue?

31:39.066 --> 31:41.235
They grounded the asteroid program.

31:41.235 --> 31:44.363
Half the jobs up here have
bonuses tied to that shit.

31:45.531 --> 31:47.032
We're all getting a haircut.

31:47.032 --> 31:49.785
But I need those bonuses. I was misled.

31:49.785 --> 31:52.162
No, this isn't what I was
told it was supposed to be.

31:52.162 --> 31:53.247
What's going on?

31:54.081 --> 31:55.958
Nothing I can't handle, sir.

31:55.958 --> 31:58.836
Mr. Baldwin, sir,
I don't mean to be the squeaky wheel.

31:58.836 --> 32:00.671
But I was hired as a fuel tech.

32:00.671 --> 32:03.799
A fuel tech who could make bonuses
if I hit certain benchmarks.

32:03.799 --> 32:06.301
And I came all this way,
millions of miles from my family,

32:06.301 --> 32:09.721
and I'm a glorified AC repairman
making pennies on the dollar.

32:09.721 --> 32:12.266
- What's your name, sailor?
- Dale, sir. Miles Dale.

32:12.266 --> 32:15.519
Miles, you know
where we are right now, yes?

32:16.270 --> 32:17.271
Where we are?

32:17.271 --> 32:19.106
Where we're standing right now.

32:20.148 --> 32:21.149
The air lock.

32:21.650 --> 32:23.026
No, Miles.

32:23.026 --> 32:26.196
We're standing on another fucking planet.

32:26.196 --> 32:30.284
And this planet, she's trying
to kill us every chance she gets.

32:30.284 --> 32:32.911
And as much as we help each other here,

32:32.911 --> 32:38.709
it does not work unless you take
some personal responsibility, Miles.

32:40.127 --> 32:43.088
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got an EVA kicking off in 20 minutes.

32:43.088 --> 32:45.174
And, Palmer, radio Ops with a new update.

32:45.174 --> 32:46.425
Copy, sir.

32:51.555 --> 32:54.141
<i>The HVA's still not talking
to any of the transponders.</i>

32:55.100 --> 32:56.768
<i>Maybe you should try another reboot?</i>

32:57.352 --> 32:59.479
<i>Yeah, not until we check
the interface connectors.</i>

32:59.479 --> 33:02.733
<i>Need to be sure we're getting both
power and data to the transponders.</i>

33:03.233 --> 33:04.276
<i>Concur.</i>

33:04.860 --> 33:05.861
<i>So, let's...</i>

33:06.737 --> 33:09.489
Seven hours out there, still no joy.

33:11.575 --> 33:12.576
<i>Copy.</i>

33:12.576 --> 33:15.621
No wonder Helios wanted us to
wait for their new satellite.

33:15.621 --> 33:18.081
They didn't even design
access to the control module.

33:18.582 --> 33:19.833
Guess they figured it'd never break.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.419
Or nobody'd be dumb enough
to try something like this.

33:22.419 --> 33:23.504
<i>...HVA.</i>

33:23.504 --> 33:26.590
<i>Okay, let's run
the transponder test routine again.</i>

33:26.590 --> 33:30.552
If our guys don't get it right soon,
we gotta call it and come back home.

33:30.552 --> 33:33.764
- I'm not ready to make that call just yet.
- All right.

33:33.764 --> 33:36.099
- All right?
- <i>Happy Valley Control,</i>

33:36.099 --> 33:39.186
<i>Sat team reports ready for another
transponder reset attempt.</i>

33:39.186 --> 33:41.146
- Here we go.
- All right. Give them the go, Ed.

33:41.813 --> 33:44.483
Satellite team, you are go for restart.

33:45.609 --> 33:46.735
<i>Sat team copies.</i>

33:47.236 --> 33:48.695
<i>Go for restart.</i>

33:52.449 --> 33:53.450
<i>Here we go.</i>

33:54.743 --> 33:57.120
<i>We got a good lock on VHS Command 3.</i>

33:57.955 --> 33:59.081
Looks good so far.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.708
Here's hoping it works this time.

34:04.002 --> 34:05.838
Reboot successful, Commander.

34:05.838 --> 34:07.798
Well, shit.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.469
We're back in business. Congratulations.

34:15.889 --> 34:18.391
Well done. Got some balls.

34:26.024 --> 34:30.487
You know, before NASA, I got fired a lot.

34:35.492 --> 34:40.205
Like, from every single job I ever had.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.375
But then Margo,

34:45.127 --> 34:46.962
she took a chance and...

34:51.049 --> 34:55.554
If she saw me now, she'd be so pissed.

34:57.222 --> 34:59.057
I could just see her face, you know.

35:00.893 --> 35:02.102
The disappointment.

35:04.521 --> 35:05.898
"Way to go, Aleida.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.233
Way to screw it all up."

35:09.985 --> 35:10.986
Hey.

35:11.987 --> 35:14.364
Hey, you wanna talk about screwing up?

35:16.491 --> 35:19.578
I just spent the last eight years

35:19.578 --> 35:22.706
getting this stupid project
off the ground,

35:23.498 --> 35:25.709
leaving my kid with my crazy mother-in-law

35:25.709 --> 35:27.586
while my dad's hiding out on Mars.

35:27.586 --> 35:30.756
And just as we were about to launch,

35:32.341 --> 35:33.926
it's all taken away.

35:36.762 --> 35:39.306
Hey. To screwing up.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.480
- You see that?
- What?

35:46.480 --> 35:48.649
The perfect medium for life.

35:50.526 --> 35:51.693
Tequila?

35:52.778 --> 35:54.905
No, no.

35:55.739 --> 35:57.032
Liquid.

35:57.032 --> 36:00.410
In a gas, the elements are
too far apart to find each other.

36:00.911 --> 36:03.497
In solids, they can't get close enough.

36:05.123 --> 36:06.124
But liquid...

36:07.501 --> 36:09.169
liquid is perfect.

36:11.547 --> 36:13.215
And I was gonna find it...

36:15.551 --> 36:17.970
in a place it had no right surviving.

36:20.222 --> 36:25.310
It fights with every cell, every fiber.

36:25.310 --> 36:26.687
It adapts.

36:29.857 --> 36:34.361
May sound corny,
but gives me hope, you know?

36:43.453 --> 36:44.872
You know what we should do?

36:47.499 --> 36:50.377
We should TP Hobson's house.

36:51.587 --> 36:52.963
I'm serious.

36:58.177 --> 36:59.428
I'm fucking down.

37:00.179 --> 37:01.555
Yeah.

37:06.143 --> 37:08.937
<i>And of course, you know
the annual 5K is happening this Saturday.</i>

37:08.937 --> 37:10.522
<i>It kicks off at the Houston Zoo.</i>

37:10.522 --> 37:13.066
<i>We're gonna be there
with some live commentary,</i>

37:13.066 --> 37:15.444
<i>some games, raffles,
fun for the whole family.</i>

37:15.444 --> 37:16.653
<i>It's all for a good cause.</i>

37:16.653 --> 37:18.655
<i>They're raising money for cancer research.</i>

37:18.655 --> 37:20.532
<i>Cancer research!</i>

37:20.532 --> 37:25.287
<i>- Come on down and cheer on the runners.
- Cheer on Grandma.</i>

37:26.163 --> 37:28.582
- <i>Is Grandma running?</i>
- Hey, lady.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.336
You barfed on our carpet last night.

37:32.336 --> 37:34.671
It smelled really bad.

37:40.761 --> 37:42.679
I'm so sorry.

37:44.681 --> 37:46.558
Hey, you're awake.

37:47.059 --> 37:48.602
Oh, shit.

37:49.353 --> 37:50.229
I forgot--

37:50.229 --> 37:52.022
No, it's fine.
We called your mother-in-law.

37:52.022 --> 37:54.983
She knows you're alive.
Though she wasn't too happy about it.

37:56.235 --> 37:58.570
- Sounds about right.
- You want some coffee?

37:59.905 --> 38:02.199
- God, yes, please.
- Gotcha.

38:12.209 --> 38:14.461
Good, you're awake.

38:15.546 --> 38:18.257
I think I figured out how
to keep your project going.

38:19.299 --> 38:21.051
What? When?

38:21.718 --> 38:22.970
Last night.

38:25.389 --> 38:27.599
She doesn't really sleep.

38:37.985 --> 38:40.279
Wait, this is...

38:42.948 --> 38:45.367
This is a plan to find private funding.

38:45.367 --> 38:46.368
Yeah.

38:46.368 --> 38:48.704
As in, leave NASA?

38:50.664 --> 38:52.457
I can't do that.

38:54.126 --> 38:55.127
Why not?

38:55.127 --> 38:58.255
All I ever wanted was to be
a part of NASA.

38:59.631 --> 39:01.091
I grew up there.

39:01.091 --> 39:04.344
And what am I gonna do,
go out and beg for someone

39:04.344 --> 39:08.015
to give me millions of dollars
to find life on Mars by myself?

39:09.516 --> 39:11.518
You wouldn't exactly be doing it alone.

39:25.282 --> 39:27.868
<i>That's right.
And not exactly sure why they've held back</i>

39:27.868 --> 39:28.869
<i>for some reason...</i>

39:36.460 --> 39:37.878
You really know how to throw a party.

39:38.462 --> 39:40.881
Well, now that the satellites are fixed,

39:40.881 --> 39:44.009
I thought it would be nice
to show a little appreciation, you know?

39:46.220 --> 39:48.138
One hell of a stupid sport.

39:53.101 --> 39:54.811
Oh, yeah!

40:12.829 --> 40:14.331
<i>And I hit record.</i>

40:16.959 --> 40:19.711
- <i>You made it.</i>
- <i>You're on Mars, Daddy.</i>

40:20.337 --> 40:21.547
<i>We miss you.</i>

40:21.547 --> 40:23.882
<i>We've been thinking
about you a lot, Miles.</i>

40:23.882 --> 40:26.260
<i>The girls have been full of questions.</i>

40:26.260 --> 40:29.555
<i>I was asking what it was like to
ride in the rocket ship.</i>

40:29.555 --> 40:30.681
<i>Seems so cool.</i>

40:30.681 --> 40:34.977
<i>And I was wondering if you,
like, ate weird liquid tube food.</i>

40:37.354 --> 40:39.064
<i>We love you, Daddy.</i>

40:39.064 --> 40:41.441
<i>Bye.</i>

40:49.157 --> 40:50.242
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

40:51.785 --> 40:54.121
<i>Have you found any Mars rocks yet, Daddy?</i>

40:54.121 --> 40:55.706
<i>Can you send me one?</i>

41:21.315 --> 41:22.858
- <i>Bye.</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

41:22.858 --> 41:24.526
<i>Bye.</i>

41:52.888 --> 41:53.889
Okay.

42:00.145 --> 42:01.730
Hey, it's me.

42:01.730 --> 42:04.650
I'm sorry I haven't sent you
a message before now.

42:05.234 --> 42:09.363
I got fitted for my space suit
and got down on the surface,

42:09.363 --> 42:10.822
set up the worksite--

42:12.282 --> 42:15.410
Lily, I didn't forget about you.

42:17.788 --> 42:18.914
Got something for you.

42:19.873 --> 42:24.211
And you guys would not
believe how beautiful it is.

42:24.211 --> 42:26.755
You know, it's-- I mean, it's amazing.

42:26.755 --> 42:32.427
It's just-- It's been-- You know, it's--

42:34.179 --> 42:36.849
It's been fucking bullshit.

42:43.856 --> 42:46.900
Sorry,
I was trying to get a little shut-eye.

42:48.777 --> 42:50.153
That was pretty fucking pathetic.

42:51.738 --> 42:53.115
Yeah, thanks.

42:56.702 --> 42:58.370
Where'd you get the Mars rock?

42:59.913 --> 43:03.584
I think it's Maya's leftover meat loaf.

43:10.924 --> 43:13.427
I really don't think I could do
two years up here.

43:13.427 --> 43:14.928
Don't really have a choice.

43:14.928 --> 43:18.098
I mean, you go back,
Helios will charge you 150,000.

43:19.308 --> 43:21.518
To recoup lost investment.

43:21.518 --> 43:22.603
Are you serious?

43:23.312 --> 43:26.315
All that money they shelled out
to train you, to get you up here.

43:27.149 --> 43:29.610
It's in our contracts the fine print.

43:31.987 --> 43:32.988
Fuck!

43:40.037 --> 43:41.038
Hey...

43:42.748 --> 43:43.832
why don't you come with me?

43:45.042 --> 43:46.168
Come on.

43:52.799 --> 43:54.009
Where are we going?

43:54.593 --> 43:55.719
Not far.

43:58.847 --> 44:00.140
Are you gonna rob me or something?

44:13.237 --> 44:14.696
'Lo, Sam.

44:14.696 --> 44:16.365
No football for you?

44:16.365 --> 44:19.368
Nah. "The sigh of the oppressed,
opium of the people."

44:21.995 --> 44:22.996
You okay?

44:24.581 --> 44:25.874
I'm okay.

44:37.427 --> 44:40.264
This is where we come
to forget our troubles.

44:40.264 --> 44:41.640
Welcome to Ilya's.

44:43.058 --> 44:44.226
What would you like?

44:45.394 --> 44:46.562
Two of the usual.

44:48.105 --> 44:49.189
You sell booze here?

44:49.773 --> 44:55.737
I ferment it in an air lock
to drive out all the CO2.

44:55.737 --> 44:57.072
That's why vodka is so pure.

45:08.709 --> 45:12.004
Hey, I'm sorry about
what happened to your buddy.

45:13.505 --> 45:14.506
Yeah, well--

45:15.883 --> 45:18.177
Happy Valley will kick your ass
if you let it.

45:18.969 --> 45:21.013
This place helps. Believe me.

45:34.193 --> 45:35.861
Oh, shit, that's strong.

45:37.112 --> 45:38.113
Goddamn.

45:39.698 --> 45:40.699
It's good.

48:41.463 --> 48:43.215
Do you know what is going on?

48:44.174 --> 48:45.551
I hear sirens.

48:45.551 --> 48:47.386
And my television--

48:47.386 --> 48:48.428
It's fine.

48:50.055 --> 48:52.266
I have bread in the oven.
You should go home.

49:30.929 --> 49:32.890
This is for your safety.

49:32.890 --> 49:36.602
Do you think I am a fool?
This is not what this is about.

49:38.395 --> 49:42.024
Close your stand
or I will close it for you.

49:43.984 --> 49:47.613
On what grounds?
You have no right to close me down!

49:47.613 --> 49:49.907
Emergency orders to clear the streets.

49:49.907 --> 49:51.700
Only essential business.

49:53.160 --> 49:55.537
Why? For what purpose?

49:55.537 --> 49:57.122
Where is Gorbachev?

49:57.122 --> 49:58.540
What have they done with him?

49:59.333 --> 50:01.335
We don't know what you are talking about.

50:01.335 --> 50:02.419
Of course you do!

50:02.419 --> 50:05.339
You are all part of it!

50:05.339 --> 50:07.216
You are destroying the Soviet Union!

50:09.968 --> 50:12.387
I've been here for 20 years!
They want to close me down!

50:12.387 --> 50:14.389
Everyone here knows me!

50:14.389 --> 50:15.807
You must clear the street.

50:15.807 --> 50:17.768
Comply or be arrested!

50:40.207 --> 50:42.960
You son of a bitch!

50:45.337 --> 50:46.338
Stop!

50:46.839 --> 50:48.841
He's just a newspaper salesman.

50:54.429 --> 50:57.766
No, I'm not a part of this!
