It's OK, baby, you figured it out.

14:53.002 --> 14:56.205
It's not the red dot that you want, it's your mama.

14:56.272 --> 14:59.842
I haven't seen her since she retired to Florida.

14:59.909 --> 15:01.810
Well, you need to go see her, honey.

15:01.878 --> 15:03.278
How am I gonna get there?

15:03.346 --> 15:05.280
Child, I'm not a witch for nothing.

15:05.348 --> 15:08.350
Florida, Florida, Florida.

15:08.418 --> 15:10.385
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

15:10.453 --> 15:13.856
I have got to start asking for payment up front.

15:15.959 --> 15:18.794
Ahh. Sunny Florida.

15:18.862 --> 15:21.296
Now, which one of these condos

15:21.364 --> 15:23.532
Belongs to my--

15:23.600 --> 15:25.801
Mother?

15:25.869 --> 15:27.402
Who knew living across the street

15:27.470 --> 15:29.872
From a lonely old woman could be so much fun.

15:29.939 --> 15:31.573
What do you think we should do with Granny today,

15:31.641 --> 15:33.976
Deep sea fishing or hot yoga?

15:34.043 --> 15:37.012
I was thinking about some old-fashion tackle football.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.814
Ooh.

15:38.882 --> 15:41.016
Oh, you two.

15:41.084 --> 15:42.551
Are you ready for another day of fun?

15:42.619 --> 15:43.752
Hmm? Hmm?

15:43.820 --> 15:45.254
Hmm.

15:45.321 --> 15:48.223
Oh, I'm afraid I have other plans.

15:48.291 --> 15:50.692
Other plans? We're your only friends.

15:50.760 --> 15:55.197
Oh. Well, it's time for my nap.

15:55.265 --> 15:56.498
Your nap?

15:56.566 --> 15:58.567
You go to bed at 4:30 in the afternoon.

15:58.635 --> 16:01.069
Get your jockstrap, Granny, we're playing football.

16:01.137 --> 16:03.539
Are you two trying to kill me?

16:03.606 --> 16:04.673
[Both] What?

16:04.741 --> 16:07.109
Listen, I'm a 90-year-old woman.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.444
I shouldn't be in a kayak.

16:09.512 --> 16:12.047
Well, what do you want to do?
And don't say sailing.

16:12.115 --> 16:16.652
Oh, I think I'd like to just lie on the beach somewhere.

16:16.719 --> 16:18.120
Great! Let's do it.

16:18.187 --> 16:20.622
Look, you two are very sweet,

16:20.690 --> 16:24.192
But you're also exhausting.

16:25.428 --> 16:27.996
Hot yoga?

16:34.103 --> 16:37.539
Oh, Sylvester!

16:37.607 --> 16:40.008
So you do know where I live.

16:40.076 --> 16:41.743
That's interesting,

16:41.811 --> 16:44.279
Considering you never visit me.

16:44.347 --> 16:46.048
Oh, um, I--

16:46.115 --> 16:47.583
Close the door.

16:47.650 --> 16:51.553
What do you want, me to air condition all of Florida?

16:53.489 --> 16:55.023
- Sorry.
- [Doorbell rings]

16:55.091 --> 16:58.727
Oh, that's my Alan now.

17:01.464 --> 17:05.067
Sylvester, what a surprise.

17:05.134 --> 17:06.935
How long are you in town?

17:07.002 --> 17:08.936
As long as mother will have me.

17:09.005 --> 17:10.571
Well, I wish you would have called

17:10.640 --> 17:12.641
Because I have bridge at 11:00,

17:12.709 --> 17:14.309
Water aerobics at noon,

17:14.377 --> 17:17.279
And then Estelle and I walk the mall.

17:17.347 --> 17:18.747
Yeesh.

17:18.815 --> 17:21.750
And I thought Tweety's voice was annoying.

17:21.818 --> 17:23.018
Don't you see, baby,

17:23.086 --> 17:25.420
It's a textbook case of denial.

17:25.488 --> 17:27.021
Huh?

17:27.089 --> 17:29.291
You want Sylvester to chase you.

17:29.359 --> 17:30.993
I do?

17:31.060 --> 17:32.961
I do!

17:33.029 --> 17:34.863
Well, then what are you waiting for?

17:34.931 --> 17:37.933
Florida, Florida, Florida.

17:38.001 --> 17:40.936
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
I've done it again.

17:41.004 --> 17:44.339
Isn't that that little
yellow bird you used to chase?

17:47.610 --> 17:49.411
You still haven't caught him?

17:49.479 --> 17:51.246
He's smarter than he looks.

17:51.314 --> 17:54.216
Maybe if you'd spent a little less time

17:54.283 --> 17:56.051
Chasing that bird,

17:56.119 --> 17:59.087
You'd have made something of yourself by now, huh?

17:59.155 --> 18:01.356
Why aren't you married?

18:01.424 --> 18:03.158
Where are my grandcats?

18:03.226 --> 18:06.461
And what's with your teeth?
They're all mangled.

18:06.529 --> 18:08.530
You don't wear the retainer, do you?

18:08.598 --> 18:10.132
Wow, listen to her go.

18:10.199 --> 18:13.568
What I wouldn't give to be back home with Granny

18:13.636 --> 18:15.971
Chasing that red dot.

18:16.039 --> 18:18.473
Retainer cost a pretty penny.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.809
And all the dentist said was

18:20.877 --> 18:23.912
If he wears the retainer, he'll have perfect teeth.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.947
And did you wear the retainer?

18:26.015 --> 18:30.619
Who needs a red dot when I've got a yellow bird?

18:30.687 --> 18:32.387
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:32.455 --> 18:37.092
It's time for me to go home.

18:37.160 --> 18:40.095
Oh, this is much better.

18:40.163 --> 18:43.298
Although it feels like something's missing.

18:43.366 --> 18:44.700
Uhh!

18:44.767 --> 18:48.070
- Oh, Sylvester.
- Granny!

18:48.137 --> 18:49.705
Tweety?

18:49.772 --> 18:51.473
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

18:51.541 --> 18:53.875
Mwah! Mwah!

18:53.943 --> 18:58.880
Turns out I like spending my time with a cat and a bird.

18:58.948 --> 19:03.085
It's better than spending it with a duck and a rabbit.

19:03.152 --> 19:05.620
Granny's missing out.

19:19.268 --> 19:20.902
[Ding]

19:26.609 --> 19:28.143
Meep Meep!

19:57.206 --> 19:59.341
[Camera shutter clicks]

20:01.210 --> 20:03.612
[Camera shutter clicks]

20:27.703 --> 20:29.137
[Grumbling]

20:29.205 --> 20:31.573
[Thud]

20:38.848 --> 20:41.016
[Bang]

21:32.668 --> 21:35.237
Meep Meep!

21:47.216 --> 21:48.950
I don't think you understand.

21:49.018 --> 21:50.986
You're my pet.

21:51.053 --> 21:55.290
I'm supposed to give you food, not be your food.

21:55.358 --> 21:57.058
Do you hear me?

21:57.126 --> 21:58.960
Hello?

21:59.028 --> 22:00.795
Bad snake!

22:01.150 --> 22:07.150
