00:02.060 --> 00:03.520
I wish.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.970
I couldtake this pain away.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.550
but I can'T.

00:09.990 --> 00:11.570
And I'm sorry.

00:11.860 --> 00:13.870
Quentin was my brother.

00:14.420 --> 00:16.320
Quentin was my friend.

00:17.070 --> 00:21.210
I've been seeing antwon,and he needs me now.

00:22.820 --> 00:24.390
What are you doing?!Hey!

00:24.790 --> 00:25.940
Shoplift much?

00:26.050 --> 00:27.520
Get off me,bitch!

00:27.680 --> 00:28.670
Hey!

00:29.460 --> 00:32.030
There was a therapistthat nathan and I went to.

00:32.189 --> 00:33.960
I can give you her number if you want.

00:34.120 --> 00:34.990
Okay.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.750
Get your filthy,murdering handsaway from my son!

You need to quit that weak-ass fadeaway.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.360
Huh?You want some cuddling?

01:05.630 --> 01:06.900
Is that what you want?

01:07.140 --> 01:07.810
Go home.

01:07.930 --> 01:09.120
Crawl back in bed with your wife.

01:11.940 --> 01:12.930
That's weak,nate.

01:13.090 --> 01:14.990
The road to the nba goes through me,boy.

01:15.270 --> 01:16.020
Come on!

01:24.770 --> 01:26.860
The hardest part of saying goodbye.

01:49.330 --> 01:51.990
Every day,we face the same truth --

01:53.330 --> 01:55.340
that life is fleeting.

02:00.470 --> 02:01.770
it's cool,coach taylor.

02:01.890 --> 02:03.070
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.910
That our time here is short.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.820
and to honor the fallen.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.290
we must live our own lives well.

02:35.210 --> 02:36.830
what does it say,mama?

02:37.580 --> 02:39.870
"You will soar on wings like eagles.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.920
You will run and not grow weary.

02:42.770 --> 02:45.140
" Do you think there's basketball in heaven?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.040
I know there is.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.790
how long has it been?

02:54.290 --> 02:55.550
Eight days.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.830
I miss him.

03:00.410 --> 03:01.730
Come on.

03:09.830 --> 03:11.090
good morning,honey.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.310
At least you're making noise.

03:14.390 --> 03:16.290
Maybe next week I'll get a "hello.

03:19.350 --> 03:24.410
Mom.you told me you were screwing one of my friends at a funeral.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.240
I figured that meant you didn't really want to talk.

03:29.430 --> 03:30.540
Okay.

03:30.890 --> 03:34.770
I should have told you about my relationship with antwon before,

03:34.890 --> 03:37.380
but we've got to find a way to deal with this,honey.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.230
How can I live here if you're not gonna talk to me?

03:41.770 --> 03:43.470
I was thinking the same thing.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.380
I thought I could get used to it.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.580
I haven'T.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.360
And I can'T.

03:55.310 --> 03:56.810
You're kicking me out?

03:56.940 --> 03:58.910
Say hi to antwon for me.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.680
Mama!It's grandpa dan.

04:09.760 --> 04:10.630
He's dead!

04:10.750 --> 04:13.160
No,buddy,he's not.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.780
This is not what it looks like.

04:14.910 --> 04:19.089
But you and daddy said the people in the cemetery are in heaven,like quentin.

04:19.410 --> 04:26.820
Right,but,uh,some people like to buy their headstones before they die -- like way before.

04:29.110 --> 04:32.710
Um,like the backpack that we got you the week before school started.

04:32.820 --> 04:36.290
It's like that.Grandpa dan's just.being prepared.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.540
- To die in a week?
- No.

04:38.630 --> 04:40.400
He's -- he's alive.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.660
Grandpa dan is alive,I promise.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.150
Then can we go see him?

05:00.540 --> 05:02.750
- Is that
- yeah.Mick wolf.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.340
Are you serious?

05:04.610 --> 05:06.230
What is he doing here?

05:06.470 --> 05:07.810
Recording,I guess.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.830
Hi.

05:17.230 --> 05:21.040
Uh,I hope you don't mind.You know,I see an empty studioand a guitar going to waste.

05:21.160 --> 05:21.950
It's just an old habit.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.180
No,no,it's cool.

05:23.810 --> 05:26.390
Um,actually,it's an honor.I'm a huge fan.

05:26.470 --> 05:30.780
I even have a couple of albumsyou played on up on the wall in my office.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.840
Well,I'm the onewho's honored.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.870
Mick wolf.

05:33.950 --> 05:38.220
You're not supposed to bein my town,let alonemy recording studio.

05:38.340 --> 05:41.660
So,why are you here?

05:42.020 --> 05:47.140
My store was robbed,and I was attacked.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.240
I see.

05:50.780 --> 05:55.440
Victims of violenceoften find it helpful to talk through the experiencein therapy.

05:55.640 --> 05:59.280
It helps them make senseof a random act.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.000
This wasn't random.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.890
Nothing my mother doesis random.

06:19.300 --> 06:20.600
So,which one's yours?

06:23.130 --> 06:25.270
Uh,mine's not here today.

06:28.860 --> 06:34.410
Right.I think I've seen youwith him before -- the little blond-hred,blue-eyed cutie.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.960
Actually,I'm his,uh.

06:39.910 --> 06:41.610
I'm his nanny.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.600
A least I wasuntil I got fired.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.610
Been there.Believe me.

06:49.120 --> 06:53.750
People don't realize how immensely important it isto be a nanny.

06:53.840 --> 06:57.270
And they never appreciatetrue devotion.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.370
It's enoughto drive you crazy.

07:00.360 --> 07:04.710
Well,in my case,my son didn't appreciatewho I was sleeping with.

07:04.830 --> 07:08.340
Yeah,they get so touchyabout that stuff.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.480
- The heart wantswhat it wants.
- Yeah.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.390
But then again,if it were me.

07:14.790 --> 07:18.860
I would do whatever it takes to stayin that little boy's life.

07:24.430 --> 07:26.960
Was there a history of abusein your family?

07:27.310 --> 07:28.540
Growing up,I mean.

07:28.970 --> 07:33.560
Not unless you considera high credit-card limit and no supervision abuse.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.210
Yet you thinkyour mother attacked you.

07:36.410 --> 07:39.770
I don't thinkvictoria did it personally.

07:40.050 --> 07:45.190
I think she hired some flying monkeyto do her dirty work.

07:46.650 --> 07:48.550
It must be hard for youto believe.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.560
What mattersis that you believe it.

07:52.340 --> 07:56.880
See,she knewthat I had just finished those sketchesfor my fall line,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.640
she knew I was keeping themat the store,

07:59.770 --> 08:04.550
and she knewthat if I showed up to my board meetingwithout them,

08:04.630 --> 08:07.200
I would look incompetent.

08:07.950 --> 08:13.360
And that's all she needsto convince the board to give her controlof my company.

08:14.270 --> 08:17.550
It sounds shakespearean.

08:18.970 --> 08:21.270
You probably thinkI'm crazy.

08:21.510 --> 08:23.640
No,I don'T.

08:24.940 --> 08:27.160
I think we havea lot to talk about.

08:27.510 --> 08:30.950
How should I start,at the beginningor just from when I fired her?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.299
You you fired your mom?

08:32.419 --> 08:33.530
It'll be fine.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.919
I can pick up the slack.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.159
Besides,nanny deb was awolmost of the time,anyway.

08:38.330 --> 08:41.500
Yeah.You know,it's funny.All these years,wecalled him "skills.

08:41.630 --> 08:43.679
" I always thought it hadsomething to do with basketball.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.390
That's not funny.

08:45.340 --> 08:46.490
Kind of funny.

08:46.570 --> 08:47.830
Come on,nate.

08:48.030 --> 08:52.350
I..Andy wasn't much older than mewhen he started dating my mom,and,I mean,look how wellthat turned out.

08:52.590 --> 08:58.470
Well,andy wasn't one of your classmates oryour supposed friends,and he wasn't seeing karenbehind your back.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.420
You got to get over thisby tomorrow night's game.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.060
Oh,I will,but I'll do it for Q Not for skills.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.760
I'm really upsetwith that guy.

09:06.810 --> 09:09.540
I know you are,but the teamneeds you and so will jamie.

09:09.630 --> 09:12.310
And the way I see it,skills will be a better fatherthan dan ever was.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.170
This iswhere grandpa dan lives?

09:25.250 --> 09:26.630
Yeah,not bad,huh?

09:26.910 --> 09:29.280
I think you shouldlet him babysit.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.970
How come grandpaisn't picking up his papers?

09:36.470 --> 09:37.660
I don't know,buddy.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.740
Maybe he doesn't likewhat's in it.

09:42.610 --> 09:44.070
Yeah,you're probably right.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.550
I don't thinkhe's home,bud.

09:55.610 --> 09:57.580
Hey,will you waitin the car for me?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.740
But I want to seegrandpa dan.

09:58.820 --> 10:00.250
I know,buddy.I just need a second.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.820
Okay.Okay.

10:05.580 --> 10:09.130
okay,dan,please don't berotting on the floor.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.660
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.230
There's my baby girl.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.240
So,what do you saywe go out tonight?

10:18.680 --> 10:22.330
I mean,after all the sneaking around,I just want to be ableto show my girl off.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.550
- Antwon.
- hmm?

10:25.940 --> 10:28.460
Nathan kicked me outof the house.

10:30.730 --> 10:37.170
Wow.I knew natewas mad,but that's messed up.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.350
Look,I'm sorry.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.450
Why don't you just stay herefor a while?

10:44.610 --> 10:47.850
Mouth's gone.Plus,you've bn herelike every night,anyway.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.400
It's not that easy.

10:51.090 --> 10:57.100
I've worked really hard to get back into my son's lifeand jamie'S.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.080
I can't compromise that now.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.610
Uh-oh.I don't likewhere this is heading.

11:03.090 --> 11:04.990
I think we have toface facts.

11:05.260 --> 11:10.440
I mean,even if nathansomehow got over this,what would your parents say?

11:10.990 --> 11:13.450
Well,my lastserious girlfriend was bevin.

11:13.570 --> 11:16.260
So I'm sure they'll saythis is a step up.

11:17.490 --> 11:20.500
I'm almost 20 years olderthan you.

11:23.430 --> 11:26.940
Yeah,but you're only as oldas you feel.

11:27.340 --> 11:29.470
And you feeljust right to me.

11:31.870 --> 11:33.210
You're so sweet.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.130
And I really like you.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.040
But I'm sorry.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.670
For the sake of my family,I think we have toend this.

11:56.660 --> 12:00.370
You ever look backon all of it and just feel really fortunateto have been a part of it?

12:01.320 --> 12:02.430
Yeah,I suppose so.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.050
It's just I don't look backthat much.

12:04.180 --> 12:05.560
God,you were right there!

12:05.640 --> 12:10.830
I mean,you wereat the center of everything and making history and giving ussomething to believe in.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.100
Didn't rolling stonecall you "the reluctant conscienceof rock"?

12:15.230 --> 12:18.410
Yeah.Rolling stone also called mea cult favorite,

12:18.540 --> 12:21.810
which is their way of sayingyou don't sell any records.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.580
Is that why you stoppedrecording?

12:24.620 --> 12:25.810
I mean,your own stuff.

12:25.890 --> 12:30.250
No.I stopped recordingmy own stuff 'cause I didn't feel like I hadanything left worth saying.

12:30.370 --> 12:33.600
You know,session workpays pretty good.You work a couple of weeksout of the month.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.430
The rest of the timeis your own.

12:35.510 --> 12:36.180
Yeah?

12:36.260 --> 12:39.140
How about you let me fill up some of thatfree time with lunch?

12:39.220 --> 12:43.890
I know a really good placedown by the water,and I kind of havea lot of questions.

12:47.090 --> 12:48.560
What's the matter?

12:48.720 --> 12:50.850
You look likeyou've seen a ghost.

12:52.120 --> 12:56.090
I feel like I have.That's your mom's jacket.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.620
You look just like her.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.810
Well,mia told meshe met someone on tour who knew ellie,

13:11.890 --> 13:15.220
but how could she not sayit was mick wolf?

13:15.810 --> 13:17.780
Mia's a good kid.She's a good singer,

13:17.870 --> 13:20.330
but she's way too youngto know who the hell I am.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.110
How'd you know who i was?

13:24.680 --> 13:29.190
When your mom got sick,it hit all of us hard --everyone who knew her.

13:29.310 --> 13:32.430
Somewhere along the line,someone gave methat benefit cd you made,

13:32.950 --> 13:37.410
and read what you said about her in the liner notes,which was which was beautiful.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.460
So I guess you could say I'm a fan of yours,too.

13:45.630 --> 13:47.530
Did you know my dad?

13:48.510 --> 13:50.110
No.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.600
I don't think anyonereally knew your dad.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.760
Hi.I'm looking for dr.Thornton.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.540
It's about dan scott,my,uh.

14:05.090 --> 14:06.630
My father-in-law.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.760
And I was wondering if you couldjust have the doctor call me.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.740
Okay.Thank you.

14:13.790 --> 14:15.460
Hey,skills.Are you okay?

14:15.780 --> 14:16.420
Nate ain't here,is he?

14:16.500 --> 14:17.450
No,you're safe.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.940
But you look,uh,not so great.

14:20.620 --> 14:21.920
Deb broke up with me.

14:22.010 --> 14:25.400
Well,I guess you can tusslewith a cougar,but you're gonna get bit.

14:25.530 --> 14:27.230
Why everybody thinkit's a big joke?

14:27.350 --> 14:29.710
Deb's just done a lotof wacky things in her life.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.850
We never thoughtyou'd be one of them.

14:31.980 --> 14:35.770
Look,I know it sounds crazy,but I really have feelingsfor her.

14:36.170 --> 14:37.470
Really?

14:38.900 --> 14:41.640
Well,all right.Well,let's,uh.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.980
let's be realisticabout this.

14:44.170 --> 14:46.590
How many good yearsdo you think deb has left?

14:47.770 --> 14:50.810
Fine,laugh all you want.I just thought maybe you couldtalk to nate for me.

14:50.940 --> 14:53.660
Oh,no.I don't want to gettin the middle of this.No,thank you.

14:53.780 --> 14:55.050
Come on,haley.

14:55.170 --> 14:57.150
You know we always hadeach other's backs.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.380
I'll see what I can do.

15:05.900 --> 15:09.270
Maybe you should just man upand talk to nathan yourself.

15:11.950 --> 15:14.400
I notice you call your mother"victoria.

15:16.100 --> 15:19.380
" She insisted after we wentinto business together.

15:20.450 --> 15:22.500
Why did you go into businesswith her?

15:23.730 --> 15:24.750
I don't know.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.530
Maybe I wanted herto love me.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.620
Is that something you still want?

15:34.830 --> 15:36.210
I bought a gun.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.680
That's not uncommonfor attack victims.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.370
It gives them a feelingof control.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.290
Unless you're having thoughtsof hurting your mother.

15:49.290 --> 15:50.010
No.

15:50.830 --> 15:53.010
I mean,I'm not crazy.

15:55.740 --> 15:58.340
But it occurs to me that.

15:59.090 --> 16:01.700
it wouldn't bother meif she were dead.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.730
And that can't be healthy,right?

16:06.580 --> 16:13.970
To feel likeif your mother was dead,you would't miss her,that you might be betterfor it.

16:17.050 --> 16:19.860
And I just don't knowhow it got to this.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.840
Maybe you should ask your motherthat question.

16:32.010 --> 16:36.390
Antwon came to see me today,and he said that deb broke up with him.

16:36.940 --> 16:38.290
He's pretty upset.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.430
Good.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.260
He shouldn't have beensleeping with my mom.

16:41.770 --> 16:44.380
Said theanwho slept with my sister.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.010
I remember the first time I saw you.I was sittingat the geek table,

16:49.090 --> 16:50.830
and you were sitting over thereat the jock table,

16:50.910 --> 16:54.030
and if we had playedby the rules of high school,we wouldn't be sitting hereat this table.

16:54.070 --> 16:55.650
Okay,all right,I get it.

16:55.780 --> 16:58.140
You and I weren't the mostconventional couple,either.

16:58.890 --> 17:00.840
Are you ever gonna stop tryingto make me into a better personal

17:01.080 --> 17:02.580
it's not likely.

17:04.359 --> 17:10.300
Speaking of exiled parents,did you know that dn alreadyhas a headstone at the emetery?

17:10.380 --> 17:12.790
It makes keith's stonelook tiny by comparison.

17:13.780 --> 17:17.550
Leave it to dan scott to get into a pissing contestwith keith even after he's dead.

17:17.819 --> 17:22.720
Yeah,well,jamie saw it,and he freaked out and insisted on seeing dan.

17:23.089 --> 17:24.030
I didn't knowwhat else to do.

17:24.109 --> 17:27.270
I-I took himover to the beach house.

17:27.359 --> 17:27.930
- Haley
- I'm sorry.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.370
Dan wasn't home,though.

17:29.410 --> 17:31.820
In fact,it looked like hehadn't been home in a few days.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.520
When was the last timeyou saw him?

17:34.410 --> 17:35.790
I don't know.A few weeks ago?

17:36.270 --> 17:37.690
He's playingmind games again.

17:37.730 --> 17:39.630
I basically told himto go off and die.

17:40.830 --> 17:42.300
Well,I'm worriedabout jamie.

17:42.500 --> 17:47.830
He's -- he's still trying to getover the death of quentin,and now dan's disappeared.

17:47.910 --> 17:49.930
I know we didn't want himaround,but jamie did.

17:50.050 --> 17:51.590
It feels kind of selfish.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.750
Well,rememberwho we're talking about.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.400
Yeah.

18:05.790 --> 18:06.900
Hey,andre.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.630
- How have you been?
- So-so.

18:11.910 --> 18:14.120
Yeah?Have you been playingbasketball?

18:14.440 --> 18:15.230
A little.

18:16.710 --> 18:19.390
Do you thinkI could be a raven someday?

18:19.590 --> 18:22.100
Mama says I'm gonna beas tall as quentin.

18:22.380 --> 18:23.800
At least 9 feet.

18:23.880 --> 18:24.870
Well,I bet you will.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.830
Why don't you come see me in about 10 years,all right?

18:29.290 --> 18:31.740
A little early to be recruiting,isn't it?

18:36.020 --> 18:37.320
Hi,coach.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.910
Why don't you come on in?

18:52.490 --> 18:53.240
Get off me!

18:53.330 --> 18:53.960
Enough!Okay?

18:54.090 --> 18:55.880
I'm gonna seeevery one of you in detention.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.270
Hold on.

18:57.780 --> 18:58.890
Hey,are you okay?

19:00.770 --> 19:04.270
Congratulations on your firsttree hill catfight.I've had a few in my day.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.520
Spare methe female bonding,okay?

19:06.640 --> 19:11.820
I may be new,but I've heardall about mrs.James-scott,a cheerleader who datedthe star of the basketball team.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.040
That is,when you weren'ton a rock tour.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.000
Your life must have beenreally tough.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.440
So just don't pretendlike you know anything about my problems,okay?

19:20.800 --> 19:22.820
See you in detention,hannah montana.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.490
hey,I foundyour shoplifter.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.310
I knew it.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.390
That little street urchindoes go to tree hill high.

19:35.550 --> 19:36.140
Thank you.

19:36.420 --> 19:37.960
She's justa messed-up kid.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.230
She's a messed-up kidtaking growth hormones.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.490
She knocked meflat on my ass.

19:42.730 --> 19:43.550
She just transferred here.

19:43.630 --> 19:47.380
I think she was probablyjust looking for a way to impress kidswith some new clothes,you know?

19:47.510 --> 19:49.280
I'll give her pointsfor having good taste.

19:49.410 --> 19:51.140
Just try and keep her awayfrom my store.

19:51.220 --> 19:56.200
Hey!James lucas scott,step away from the mannequin before I come over there and pluck out your eyells.

19:58.180 --> 20:00.070
Did I just soundlike a total bitch?

20:00.150 --> 20:04.460
Yes.And you also sounded like a mom -- a good one.

20:04.590 --> 20:06.640
Oh,he usually makes itso easy.

20:06.730 --> 20:09.810
Hmm.And what happenswhen he doesn't?

20:10.010 --> 20:11.910
He's still the most loved kidin the world.

20:15.610 --> 20:18.340
- okay?
- Yeah.

20:19.490 --> 20:22.450
I just wish I had had a family like yours.

20:22.610 --> 20:24.830
You do.You're aunt brooke.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.780
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:30.170 --> 20:36.300
Yeah.I just -- you know,ellie never really told me a lot about my father.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.630
And I guess she didn't want meto know much.

20:38.710 --> 20:39.780
I don't know.

20:39.870 --> 20:46.110
And so I was just hopingyou could -- I don't know.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.830
I knew him a little.

20:51.530 --> 20:54.060
Um.ellie loved him.

20:54.140 --> 20:56.160
And he loved her right back.

20:56.790 --> 21:01.540
And their romance was oneof the all-time greats.

21:02.450 --> 21:05.450
which meant it was messy.

21:06.280 --> 21:10.630
But,uh.we shouldall be that lucky,right?

21:10.750 --> 21:12.840
To be so passionate about someone.

21:15.330 --> 21:17.340
Yeah.Oh,oh,which reminds me.

21:17.740 --> 21:22.370
Um,god,my fiancis gonna kill me if I let you leave townwithout meeting him.

21:22.810 --> 21:25.850
You don't like basketballby any chance,do you?

21:26.760 --> 21:30.130
- Bobcats?
- Ravens.

21:41.070 --> 21:42.450
Microwave soup?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.510
What's the problem?

21:44.630 --> 21:47.950
Nanny deb always makes mesliders on game days.

21:48.030 --> 21:49.050
Oh,she does,huh?

21:49.180 --> 21:52.100
With two picklesfor good luck.

21:52.260 --> 21:55.420
Well,daddy nathanmakes you soup.

21:56.020 --> 21:58.230
When is she coming back?

21:59.180 --> 22:00.480
I don't know,buddy.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.760
Is it becauseshe was kissing uncle skills?

22:03.850 --> 22:05.710
- You knew about that?
- Yeah.

22:05.830 --> 22:11.120
They tried to pretend he was getting somethingout of her eye,but they were just being all mushy.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.450
Yeah.And how does it feel to be scarred for life?

22:13.580 --> 22:15.510
Fine.I like nanny deb.

22:15.790 --> 22:17.490
I like uncle skills.

22:17.610 --> 22:19.630
So what if they likeeach other?

22:19.710 --> 22:21.640
It's a little more complicatedthan that.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.660
Your nanny deb is also my mom.

22:23.750 --> 22:27.300
Yeah.But I let you kiss my mom.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.890
Eat your soup.

22:37.980 --> 22:41.230
As you all know,tonight's basketball gameis dedicated to quentin,

22:41.390 --> 22:43.950
and I think it would be great if you could all be there,so no homework.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.240
But don't worry.We'll make itup next week,though.I promise.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.430
Sam.stick around.I want to talk to you.

22:57.280 --> 23:01.580
Um.I read your paperthat you wrote on quentin.

23:02.690 --> 23:07.390
It was very good,and I think you should spendsome more time writing.

23:07.710 --> 23:10.590
and maybe a little less timeshoplifting.

23:12.610 --> 23:13.740
I don't knowwhat you're talking about.

23:13.870 --> 23:14.810
Relax.

23:14.900 --> 23:19.950
One of my best friends,brooke,owns clothes over bros,and she's not gonnapress charges.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.780
Actually,she sent you a gift.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.450
You know,I'm not homeless,okay?

23:28.530 --> 23:30.710
Tell your friendI don't need her charity.

23:30.990 --> 23:34.660
Sam.I don't knowwhat you're going through.

23:34.740 --> 23:36.160
I don't know anythingabout your life.

23:36.250 --> 23:40.160
But if you want to talk,I am here to listen.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.330
Great.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.280
why don't you guyshead to the locker room?

24:00.410 --> 24:02.220
Come on.We got a game tonight.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.040
Hey,nate,can we talk?

24:06.590 --> 24:07.740
Hey,grandpa.

24:09.670 --> 24:11.210
Look,I'm hereto support the team,skills.

24:11.290 --> 24:12.560
I don't really have anythingto say to you.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.060
Then don'T.Just listen.

24:15.720 --> 24:20.740
I know me and deb together sounds likesome freaky porn thing,and maybe it startedthat way.

24:20.820 --> 24:21.650
This isn't helping.

24:21.690 --> 24:23.670
But the thing is.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.130
Your mom makes me happy.

24:26.330 --> 24:27.950
And I thinkI make her happy,too.

24:28.030 --> 24:30.120
I can't believe we're evenhaving this conversation.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.170
Look,neither one of uswants to do anything that's gonna mess things upfor you.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.640
It's a little latefor that.

24:35.270 --> 24:36.610
Okay,you're right.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.580
I should have told you abouteverything from the beginning.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.630
But I reallycare for her,nate.

24:46.290 --> 24:48.700
Look,I'll just leave the ballin your court.

25:02.730 --> 25:05.890
all right,look,I know you don't feel muchlike playing basketball tonight.

25:06.720 --> 25:07.670
And I get it.

25:07.830 --> 25:10.710
When I was in high school,someone close to mewas taken away.

25:12.370 --> 25:16.870
And I-I couldn't understand how a gamecould matter anymore.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.760
But my coach was a wise man,

25:21.260 --> 25:24.860
and he told me that basketballwas more than just a game,

25:26.440 --> 25:30.830
that it had the powerto heal me if I let it.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.440
he was right.

25:36.250 --> 25:40.360
now there's someone elseI'd like you to hear from.

25:44.410 --> 25:45.600
Hi,guys.

25:47.770 --> 25:52.550
This last weekhas been hard on all of us.

25:52.910 --> 25:58.040
But what gets me through is trying to rememberthe happy times with quentin.

25:58.200 --> 26:03.100
And lord knows that boywas never happier than when he was holdinga basketball.

26:03.850 --> 26:10.060
Now,coach says that,um,some of you might be feelinga little guilty about playing tonight.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.310
Well,let me tell youone thing that I know.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.580
Quentin would want youto play tonight.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.350
Play your hearts out.

26:17.550 --> 26:18.930
And if you don'T.

26:19.510 --> 26:23.020
well,andre here -- I think he's gonna go outand play for you.

26:23.140 --> 26:24.440
Right,baby?

26:24.910 --> 26:27.200
And one more thing.

26:27.730 --> 26:34.050
Don't feel like you're moving onwithout quentin because he's gonna be with youon that court.

26:34.210 --> 26:35.710
I'm sure of that.

26:37.610 --> 26:39.070
So am I.

26:44.760 --> 26:50.600
And he's gonna be right here right by your heart.

26:52.030 --> 26:56.850
So.who wants to carry him outonto that court?

27:24.580 --> 27:30.300
every day,we facethe same truth,that our time here is short.

27:30.970 --> 27:37.410
And to honor the fallen,we must liveour own lives well.

27:37.980 --> 27:45.610
We must take the high roadwhen we can and allow our common loss to bring us together.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.970
I think that's the way Q.Would have wanted it.

27:50.530 --> 27:54.480
And while tonight we miss our fallen teammate.

27:54.950 --> 27:56.310
friend.

27:57.780 --> 27:59.210
loved one.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.870
we commemorate him for all time.

28:03.270 --> 28:07.800
No raven will ever wear the number 44 again.

28:08.670 --> 28:14.750
And for as longas this gym stands,quentin fields.

28:14.930 --> 28:17.110
will be here with us.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.930
No one can take his placeon this team.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.230
And no one.

28:23.430 --> 28:26.730
can take his placein our hearts.

28:47.210 --> 28:52.590
moment silence for Number 44,quentin fields.

29:03.780 --> 29:07.090
Hi,chester.Long time,no see.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.300
I just need.

29:10.970 --> 29:19.390
a few of jamie's thingsfor our little road trip,just enoughto make him comfortable.

29:29.340 --> 29:32.030
These peopleare so lost without me.

29:36.230 --> 29:39.470
It's a good thingyou can't talk,chester.

29:40.540 --> 29:43.410
Otherwise,you'd be my dinner tonight.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.540
Mmm.Tasty.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.280

30:46.290 --> 30:50.160
******

30:56.300 --> 30:57.320
******

30:57.450 --> 30:58.800
Come on,ravens!

30:59.120 --> 31:00.820
Come on,now!

31:01.290 --> 31:03.820
This might be the greatest lossI'll ever see.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.090
Well,sometimesit's not about winning.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.460
Sometimes it's about healing.

31:19.720 --> 31:20.580
Now's your chance.

31:21.610 --> 31:23.080
The gun's loaded.Just aim low.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.540
I'd like to look goodat my funeral.

31:25.820 --> 31:27.430
What is the matterwith you?

31:27.600 --> 31:30.520
What -- what happenedto your eyes?

31:30.600 --> 31:32.140
As if you don'talready know.

31:32.270 --> 31:35.700
All I know is that my daughtershows up at my doorstep with a gun.

31:35.830 --> 31:39.450
All I know is my motherhad me attacked in my store.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.160
Oh,my god.Brooke.

31:44.540 --> 31:46.600
are you sayingit wasn't you?

31:46.990 --> 31:48.810
Did you go to the police?

31:49.050 --> 31:51.260
Does anyone elseknow about this?

31:51.420 --> 31:52.760
Don't worry.

31:53.950 --> 31:56.050
You've trained me very well.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.940
I put the company first.

31:57.990 --> 32:00.060
It's just the publicity.

32:00.180 --> 32:04.090
This from the woman who saidshe could spin it favorably if I had a drug problem.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.090
I want you to answermy question.

32:07.220 --> 32:08.670
You want an answer?

32:09.660 --> 32:11.090
Here's one.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.170
I would neverphysically harm you.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.970
Well,maybe you didn'tmean to.

32:17.800 --> 32:21.520
It was late.You thought millicentwould be there.You hate her.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.480
You are so paranoid --and wrong.

32:27.350 --> 32:31.140
Someone died last week.

32:31.540 --> 32:41.770
And I wasn't close to him,but my friends were,and yet,in the midstof all their grief,I felt nothing.

32:42.130 --> 32:44.740
I just felt cold.

32:44.860 --> 32:50.390
And I realized I'm turninginto the one person I do not want to become.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.370
I'm turning into you.

32:53.480 --> 32:56.080
What do you want meto say,brooke?

32:56.250 --> 32:58.770
That I was a failureas a mother?

32:59.140 --> 33:02.740
You got everythingyou wanted.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.520
Except your love.

33:04.620 --> 33:11.040
When I was your age,I dreamed of havinga clothing line,of having a business.

33:11.240 --> 33:14.170
Of all the thingsyou have.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.720
But I stupidly fell in love.

33:17.920 --> 33:22.230
And one morning,your father and igot a little surprise.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.910
I told himI didn't want kids.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.050
It was never the plan.

33:28.410 --> 33:32.830
But he wanted a sonmore than anything.

33:33.150 --> 33:38.120
And as soon as I got fat,he had an excuse to jump intoany bed he wanted.

33:38.880 --> 33:46.180
And when we hadour little baby girl,I made sure I would neverbe pregnant again.

33:47.170 --> 33:51.040
If I couldn't have my dream,your fathercouldn't have his,either.

33:52.860 --> 33:57.200
I probably took it out on youa little too much along the way,but you know what?

33:57.560 --> 34:02.040
You should be thanking mefor giving you life.Do you understand that?

34:02.630 --> 34:04.490
I do thank you.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.970
Because now I knowit wasn't my fault.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.170
It was never my fault.

34:12.429 --> 34:17.020
I'm calling the lawyerstomorrow,and I'm divesting my interestsin clothes over bros --

34:18.750 --> 34:21.210
the magazine,the line.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.770
You can have everything.

34:29.550 --> 34:32.350
Congratulations,victoria.

34:32.620 --> 34:35.469
Now you have a companyand no daughter.

34:35.630 --> 34:37.330
You got your dream.

34:54.739 --> 34:57.710
Years from now,the record bookswill show that.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.910
the ravens lost to the wildcatson this night.

35:06.560 --> 35:12.600
But here's somethingthat those records won't show,something that.

35:14.620 --> 35:19.360
no one in that gymwill ever forget.

35:22.280 --> 35:37.160
that the four-man ravens made the wildcats fight and scratch and claw for every single secondof that win.

35:39.330 --> 35:48.460
And in doing so,they showed that a team will always be more importantthan statistics.

35:49.050 --> 35:57.420
When your grandkids ask you about this game,you tell them that you played hard.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.740
for quentin fields.

36:01.730 --> 36:03.550
that you stood tall.

36:06.830 --> 36:09.630
and you did itto honor your friend.

36:12.450 --> 36:14.590
You shouldbe proud of yourselves,men.

36:17.430 --> 36:19.170
I know I'm proud of you.

36:21.620 --> 36:22.800
Coach.

36:25.270 --> 36:28.110
we want to play with fourthe rest of the season.

36:33.390 --> 36:35.690
That's gonna be hardon all of you.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.410
We want to do it for Q.

36:38.650 --> 36:40.110
He's our fifth.

36:45.500 --> 36:48.970
it's been an honorcoaching you guys.

37:30.330 --> 37:33.250
so,are you sure you don'twant to stay and meet lucas?

37:33.530 --> 37:34.670
Another time.

37:34.870 --> 37:38.590
I think I'm gonna stay aroundfor a little while,do some recording.

37:38.730 --> 37:41.890
Oh.It just so happensI have an empty studio.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.110
Really?

37:43.270 --> 37:46.000
I thought you said you didn'thave anything left worth saying.

37:47.070 --> 37:48.770
Maybe one more thing.

37:50.980 --> 37:52.330
Okay,mick.

37:53.030 --> 37:58.570
When mia said that there wassomebody asking about me who knew ellie.

37:59.910 --> 38:04.730
I thought maybe.you were my father.

38:07.310 --> 38:09.250
That would be something,wouldn't it?

38:12.250 --> 38:13.990
I'll see you later.

38:31.050 --> 38:33.220
- where to?
- The airport.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.530
I'm going home to my family.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.850

39:12.970 --> 39:17.790
Mom.I want youto move back in.

39:18.850 --> 39:20.430

39:20.560 --> 39:22.100
He needs his nanny deb.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.020
He really makes you happy?

39:32.850 --> 39:34.150
He does.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.970
But you've had to sacrificeso much for me over the years,nathan.

39:38.060 --> 39:39.440
I just don't want to see it.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.130
Okay,I don't want to hear about it.

39:43.070 --> 39:44.620
But whatever you want.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.570

40:07.170 --> 40:08.520
Yeah,this is haley.

Uh,okay.Yeah.Thank you for calling.

40:17.650 --> 40:18.670
You too.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.110
What's wrong?

40:22.270 --> 40:24.880
Uh.that was dan's doctor.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.430
Apparently,they had a heart for him and he neveranswered their call.

40:29.570 --> 40:32.020
Then he really hasgone off to die.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.770
Hey,nate.

41:06.010 --> 41:08.500
I know Q.Was working with youto get your game back.

41:16.330 --> 41:18.230

41:20.990 --> 41:22.890
