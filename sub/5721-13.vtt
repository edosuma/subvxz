WEBVTT

00:05.090 --> 00:07.342
[man trills tongue, hums]

00:10.830 --> 00:12.434
I found me a woman

00:12.490 --> 00:15.448
But she stands too tall

00:15.490 --> 00:17.003
I give her every inch
of my dream

00:17.060 --> 00:19.005
'Cause it's too small

00:19.060 --> 00:22.018
No early morning...

00:22.060 --> 00:23.789
LUCCA:
Alicia.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.492
This shouldn't take more
than 15 minutes, right, Alicia?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.286
You accept the guilty plea,

00:31.330 --> 00:33.673
you don't see more than
a day of jail time,

00:33.720 --> 00:36.894
and it's expunged from
your record in 24 months.

00:36.940 --> 00:39.295
Yes.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.729
Two years and a day
of community service,

00:41.780 --> 00:43.771
and... you know.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.159
SCHAKOWSKY:
Next...

00:46.220 --> 00:47.517
What's wrong
with you?

00:47.560 --> 00:49.346
This guy means
a lot of money.

00:49.390 --> 00:51.176
He wants to hear it
from you, not me.

00:51.220 --> 00:53.825
I know, I'm just taking a minute
to catch up, that's all.

00:53.870 --> 00:55.007
Hey, Bernie.

00:55.050 --> 00:56.392
What are you
doing upstairs?

00:56.440 --> 00:58.135
Seeing how the
other half lives.

00:58.180 --> 01:00.489
Hi, Alicia.

01:00.530 --> 01:01.963
Bernie.

01:02.010 --> 01:03.443
We really miss you
downstairs.

01:03.490 --> 01:05.139
SCHAKOWSKY:
...thousand each. Enjoy.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.441
[gavel slams]
There's my guys.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.583
What's this?

01:10.630 --> 01:12.416
Uh, the overflow from
downstairs, Your Honor.

01:12.460 --> 01:13.449
Male 128, 29, 30.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.286
Okay, got it.

01:15.330 --> 01:18.720
You understand
you are pleading guilty, sir?

01:18.770 --> 01:20.112
MAN:
Yes, Your Honor, I understand.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.718
SCHAKOWSKY:
Six months probation.

01:21.770 --> 01:22.725
[gavel slams]
Next.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.772
What do you have?

01:24.820 --> 01:26.424
MAN 2: Your Honor,
we have Frank Lister.

01:26.470 --> 01:27.778
[mouthing]
He is charged
with disorderly conduct.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.731
This is his second offense.

01:29.780 --> 01:31.736
SCHAKOWSKY: $1,500.
[gavel slams]

01:31.780 --> 01:34.123
Next defendant.
Do we know that guy?

01:34.180 --> 01:35.124
Which guy?

01:35.180 --> 01:36.340
The convict in the middle.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.000
He just whispered,
"Help me."

01:40.050 --> 01:41.529
SCHAKOWSKY: Fine. Okay,
let's handle the overflow.

01:41.570 --> 01:43.879
Male 128,
let's go.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.138
Disorderly conduct.
Do we have a plea here?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.964
BUKOVITZ: Uh, we've already
pled not guilty, Your Honor.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.362
We're ready to go to trial.
SCHAKOWSKY: Good. Mr. ASA?

01:49.410 --> 01:50.798
ASA:
Almost, Your Honor.

01:50.840 --> 01:51.886
We're still trying
to locate a witness.

01:51.930 --> 01:52.885
We ask for a continuance.

01:52.930 --> 01:54.101
How long do you need?

01:54.150 --> 01:55.674
ASA:
Two months should do it.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.153
SCHAKOWSKY:
Good. Continuance granted.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.418
We'll go to trial April 15.
[gavel slams]

01:59.460 --> 02:01.189
SCHAKOWSKY:
Sheriff, please escort
the defendant back to lockup.

02:01.250 --> 02:02.285
[buzzing]

02:05.770 --> 02:07.726
You_were in bond court
eight months ago.

02:07.770 --> 02:09.726
Yes.

02:09.780 --> 02:12.738
You were_
my second client.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.692
You... you've been
in prison all this time?

02:15.740 --> 02:18.083
Yes.
But it was just
a disorderly charge.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.529
I know.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.219
With $150,000 bail.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.430
I couldn't afford it.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.912
But that was
to punIsh me, not you.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.177
Didn't your case get called?

02:25.230 --> 02:26.652
Three times.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.314
The prosecutor keeps
needing to find a witness.

02:29.620 --> 02:30.962
Didn't Bernie ask

02:31.020 --> 02:33.409
for a speedy trial any
of those three times?

02:33.450 --> 02:35.406
No, he's new, he
wasn't my lavwer.

02:35.450 --> 02:36.792
You've had three
different lavwers?

02:36.850 --> 02:38.067
[door opens]
Four with you.

02:38.110 --> 02:39.759
What the hell
is going on here?

02:39.810 --> 02:41.107
What's your name?

02:41.160 --> 02:42.934
Clayton Riggs.
I'm Alicia Florrick.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.709
Yeah, and I'm Bernie.
Let's go, Alicia.

02:44.770 --> 02:47.113
Visiting hours are over.
You want my help?

02:47.160 --> 02:49.594
BUKOVITZ: Alicia,
stop talking to my client.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.427
Sir, if you want my help,
you can switch lawyers.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.381
BUKOVITZ: Alicia, I need you
to get the hell out.

02:54.430 --> 02:55.772
ALICIA: He's been in jail
for eight months.

02:55.820 --> 02:57.606
He lost his job, his wife.

02:57.650 --> 02:59.254
His son is with child services.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.734
And you want to do what for him?
ALICIA: Get him out.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.350
Schakowslq is never gonna change
the trial date, you know that.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.560
He will if we sue him.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.226
Judges have immunity.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.226
Not if they knowingly violate
a defendant's civil rights.

03:11.270 --> 03:12.669
Is this about getting back
at Schakowslq?

03:12.710 --> 03:14.405
No.

03:14.450 --> 03:16.224
No.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.669
Then is this to assuage
your guilty conscience?

03:18.720 --> 03:20.665
This is about getting
a man who has been

03:20.720 --> 03:22.585
unlawfully imprisoned
for eight months

03:22.630 --> 03:25.542
out of jail so he
can be with his kid.

03:25.590 --> 03:27.455
[knocking on door]
And you're doing
this pro bono.

03:27.510 --> 03:28.989
RSCWW

03:29.030 --> 03:31.544
We'll take 20%
of the $1.3 million.
No.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.114
Because there'll
never be $1.3 million.

03:35.990 --> 03:38.254
Oh, hi.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.813
Hi.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.826
You're back.

03:41.870 --> 03:44.031
I thought you were gone
for another few months.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.308
Yeah, I didn't like it.
[chuckles]

03:49.490 --> 03:51.788
Can I come in?

03:51.840 --> 03:54.183
Yeah, sorry.

03:54.230 --> 03:55.356
See my hat?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.356
"Take a byte out
of Silicon Valley."

03:57.410 --> 03:58.798
I do.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.276
And... I got you
oven mitts.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.662
[chuckles]

04:03.720 --> 04:05.199
Thank you.

04:09.030 --> 04:12.807
Uh, well, you...
you have any work?

04:12.860 --> 04:14.202
Can you work?

04:14.250 --> 04:15.205
I can.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.024
How much?

04:17.080 --> 04:19.036
$20 raise.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.072
Um, can I talk to
my partner about it?

04:25.090 --> 04:28.048
Sure, yeah.

04:28.090 --> 04:29.478
Give me a call.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.475
Okay, I will.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.353
Jason.

04:38.660 --> 04:40.662
I'm glad you're back.

04:42.190 --> 04:45.011
[chuckling]:
Okay.

04:53.290 --> 04:54.632
Hey, it's Jason Crouse.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.851
I'm back in Chicago.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.151
You need anything?

04:57.200 --> 04:59.555
Yes, as a matter
of fact, right now.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.556
What's going on there,
a gang war?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.591
[chuckles] Worse,
Illinois Park College

05:03.650 --> 05:05.902
is trying to close down
its student newspaper.

05:05.950 --> 05:07.906
Ah, so a big case.

05:07.950 --> 05:11.306
The daughter of a client,
$33 million a year in billings.

05:11.350 --> 05:14.080
On my way.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.086
Thank you, Ms. Lockhart.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.744
Imogen.
[chuckles]

05:17.790 --> 05:20.258
I keep thinking of you
as a perpetual 14-year-old.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.129
Yeah, my mom does, too.

05:22.190 --> 05:23.964
DIANE:
How are you holding up in here?

05:24.010 --> 05:25.796
This is not what I expected.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.570
IMOGEN: Yeah, it's weird to be
the most hated person on campus.

05:28.630 --> 05:29.972
DIANE:
Just like your mother.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.578
MAN:
It's hate speech,

05:31.630 --> 05:35.157
and this campus is supposed
to be a safe space.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.191
It's an editorial, it's not
arguing anything hateful.

05:37.240 --> 05:40.198
You called the administrators
"mindless lemmings...

05:40.250 --> 05:43.333
about to fall off
the cliff of fascism."

05:43.380 --> 05:44.768
IMOGEN:
Yes, because you're thinking

05:44.820 --> 05:47.516
of divesting from Israel
and requiring stamps

05:47.560 --> 05:49.425
on all products made
by Israelis in the West Bank.

05:49.470 --> 05:51.688
I wrote an editorial
about it, that's all.

05:51.740 --> 05:53.082
I understand why
you don't like it,

05:53.130 --> 05:54.950
but closing down the paper...

05:55.000 --> 05:56.388
The fact that
the school is willing

05:56.440 --> 05:58.305
to stand up
for oppressed populations--

05:58.350 --> 06:00.136
it's why a lot of us
chose to come here.

06:00.180 --> 06:01.226
Um, Dean Randolph,

06:01.270 --> 06:02.703
ifI may.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.524
Oh, yes, you're the lawyer,

06:04.580 --> 06:06.389
here to speak
for Ms. Stowe, yes.
That's right.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.793
We understand that
Illinois Park College

06:08.840 --> 06:12.799
is a private institution and not
governed by the First Amendment,

06:12.850 --> 06:17.230
but, uh, you are governed
by your student handbook,

06:17.280 --> 06:19.760
a binding legal contract.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.415
And the handbook lists
"freedom from persecution"

06:22.460 --> 06:24.724
_ as the school's
primary commitment.

06:24.770 --> 06:27.682
And I think it's hard
to argue that a threat

06:27.730 --> 06:30.688
to defund the school newspaper
is anything but persecution.

06:30.730 --> 06:32.869
RANDOLPH: Oh, no, the move
to defund the paper

06:32.910 --> 06:34.684
is not a sword, but a shield--

06:34.740 --> 06:37.083
to protect the safe space
Gary's talking about.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.519
Oh, well, the handbook also says
the school promotes

06:39.570 --> 06:41.652
_ "tolerance _
of diverse Viewpomts."

06:41.700 --> 06:44.658
Ms. Stowe clearly has a diverse
viewpoint and chose to...

06:44.700 --> 06:47.225
I helped write that handbook,
ma'am, and I can tell you

06:47.270 --> 06:49.226
_we did not_ have _
your interpretation in mind.

06:49.270 --> 06:52.535
We meant to protect the
viewpoints of diverse people.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.400
The people, themselves.

06:54.450 --> 06:55.758
Not the viewpoints.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.586
I, um...
[chuckles]

06:59.630 --> 07:02.679
Before I, um...

07:02.720 --> 07:05.063
take issue with that idea,

07:05.120 --> 07:07.896
it is a well-established
legal principle

07:07.940 --> 07:09.635
that a party to a contract

07:09.690 --> 07:11.464
does not also get
to interpret that contr...

07:11.510 --> 07:14.468
I'm sure, but this is not
a court of law, it's a school.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.863
But you should realize
that any university--

07:16.910 --> 07:20.209
public or private-- must stand
for basic notions of fairness.

07:20.260 --> 07:21.568
And that is what
we are here to do:

07:21.610 --> 07:24.659
enforce progressive
notions of fairness.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.474
So why don't we at least
take a preliminary vote,

07:26.530 --> 07:27.872
see where we're at.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.876
All those in favor

07:29.920 --> 07:32.707
of defunding the Courier
for the current school year.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.570
[excited chattering]

07:34.620 --> 07:37.225
[whooping]

07:37.280 --> 07:38.577
So is that it?

07:38.630 --> 07:40.450
No, actually.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.274
This handbook
guarantees your right

07:42.330 --> 07:44.582
to take your grievances
to arbitration.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.632
Do you want to?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.713
Alicia.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.490
Good.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.324
Hi.

08:30.370 --> 08:32.713
Hello.

08:32.770 --> 08:34.761
Thanks for dropping by.

08:38.470 --> 08:40.779
I need to say it again.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.640
I'm sorry I hurt you.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.511
I'm sorry for
erasing the message.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.903
Like I said, a day hasn't
passed when I haven't...

08:47.960 --> 08:49.348
What did it say?

08:49.390 --> 08:50.823
What?

08:50.870 --> 08:53.691
The voice mail--
what did it say?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.779
What I told you before.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.141
I want to know...

09:02.190 --> 09:04.146
everything he said,
word for word.

09:04.190 --> 09:06.146
Alicia, it's been six years,
I'm not sure...
And a day hasn't passed

09:06.190 --> 09:07.589
that you haven't
thought about it,

09:07.630 --> 09:10.360
so... what did it say?

09:13.680 --> 09:18.060
"You want to know
what my plan is?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.076
My plan is that I love you."

09:23.510 --> 09:25.387
And then he said something
about Georgetown.

09:25.430 --> 09:28.342
What about Georgetown?

09:28.390 --> 09:31.769
How he'd always loved you,
ever since Georgetown.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.434
What else?

09:33.480 --> 09:34.993
Don't stop.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.654
Alicia, I don't think
this is a good idea.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.133
I want to know it all.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.522
I want to know every
single word he said.

09:39.570 --> 09:40.650
You're torturing yourself.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.053
Which is my right.

09:46.580 --> 09:50.368
He said he would
meet you anywhere,

09:50.410 --> 09:51.752
and you can make a plan then.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.199
Did he mention a place?

09:53.240 --> 09:54.195
No.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.628
A time?

09:55.680 --> 09:57.022
No.

09:57.070 --> 09:59.459
Is that important?

09:59.510 --> 10:00.898
What else?

10:03.900 --> 10:07.370
Just that if this didn't
make sense to you,

10:07.430 --> 10:12.163
to ignore him,
ignore the message...

10:12.220 --> 10:15.212
and things will
go on as usual.

10:19.220 --> 10:23.486
So when I didn't respond,
he thought I got the message...

10:23.530 --> 10:26.829
and thinks...

10:26.880 --> 10:31.180
we just...
we went back to usual?

10:33.670 --> 10:36.195
Yes, I guess.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.508
Are you out of your tiny
little mind, Mrs. Florrick?

10:54.560 --> 10:56.516
You don't need to say "little"
when you say "tiny."

10:56.560 --> 10:57.822
One or the other will do.

10:57.870 --> 10:59.826
You're suing me?

10:59.870 --> 11:01.690
You're suing a
sitting judge?

11:01.740 --> 11:03.788
Do you understand the meaning
of professional suicide?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.081
I know the meaning of a judge

11:05.140 --> 11:06.869
who let _an innocent man
Sit in prison

11:06.920 --> 11:08.876
for eight months
with a bail amount...
Did you miss the day

11:08.920 --> 11:10.478
in law school where they taught

11:10.530 --> 11:12.578
the concept
ofjudicial immunity?

11:12.620 --> 11:13.962
That protects you
from being sued

11:14.020 --> 11:15.920
for what you did professionally,
not personally.

11:15.970 --> 11:18.404
This crusade is gonna cost you.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.405
It's gonna cost
you so much.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.280
Shall we get that
down on tape, Your Honor?

11:22.330 --> 11:24.025
Your ex parte threats?

11:28.770 --> 11:29.941
I didn't think so.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.241
See you in court!

11:45.530 --> 11:46.519
TRACY:
You can't second-guess

11:46.570 --> 11:47.173
agents of the judiciary,
Your Honor.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.745
As you yourself know,

11:49.790 --> 11:51.269
judges need
wide-ranging discretion

11:51.310 --> 11:52.789
in order to do their jobs

11:52.840 --> 11:55.138
and not worry about
taking an unpopular stance

11:55.190 --> 11:56.748
or making
an honest mistake.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.882
Discretion, yes,
but it can't be unlimited.

11:58.930 --> 12:00.750
Judicial immunity
has to be unlimited.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.791
ALICIA: Yes, but we are filing
a civil rights claim

12:02.850 --> 12:05.068
under 42 U.S.C. 1983.

12:05.110 --> 12:06.714
TRACY: Going after
the judge personally

12:06.760 --> 12:08.284
is merely
an end-around...
No.

12:08.330 --> 12:09.547
We are holding

12:09.590 --> 12:10.989
Don Schakowslq
accountable

12:11.030 --> 12:12.930
as an individual
for Violating

12:12.990 --> 12:14.981
Mr. Riggs' Sixth Amendment
right to a speedy trial

12:15.030 --> 12:16.759
and Eighth
Amendment freedom

12:16.820 --> 12:18.981
from cruel
and unusual punishment.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.337
He exceeded
his authority,

12:20.390 --> 12:22.346
so he _has to answer
to this personally.

12:22.390 --> 12:23.869
Your Honor,
this is a direct attack

12:23.910 --> 12:25.775
on the foundation
of an independent judiciary.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.821
Imagine that
your decision here,

12:27.870 --> 12:29.303
in this case, could
be subject to a suit.

12:29.350 --> 12:32.353
It would be chaos.
Exactly.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.913
Mrs. Florrick may
like or dislike

12:33.970 --> 12:35.915
the way His Honor
Schakowslq does his job.

12:35.970 --> 12:37.392
But she does not have
the right to veto it.

12:37.450 --> 12:38.667
We're not asking

12:38.710 --> 12:40.018
for a veto,
Your Honor.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.015
This man has been held

12:41.060 --> 12:42.015
in prison for
eight months,

12:42.060 --> 12:44.790
his bail set
at $150,000.

12:44.850 --> 12:47.455
$150,000?

12:47.500 --> 12:48.842
What did he do?

12:48.890 --> 12:50.061
LUCCA:
The charge is
disorderly conduct.

12:50.110 --> 12:54.149
$150,000 for disorderly conduct?

12:54.200 --> 12:55.371
LUCCA:
Yes, Your Honor.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.728
Three men
knocked him down

12:56.770 --> 12:58.761
coming out of a concert
and stole his wallet.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.243
When the police arrived,
they arrested him, too.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.598
He was the victim,
not the perpetrator.
TRACY:
That isn't proven yet.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.810
Yes, because Schakowslq...

13:04.870 --> 13:05.939
His HonorSchakowsky.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.251
His Honor Schakowslq

13:07.300 --> 13:08.779
has delayed trial three times.

13:08.830 --> 13:09.956
Three times, Your Honor.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.513
And eight months later,

13:11.570 --> 13:13.526
our client is
still in prison.

13:13.570 --> 13:15.652
He lost his job,
his wife divorced him,

13:15.700 --> 13:17.691
and his eight-year-old child
has been taken from his home.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.138
That is unjust.

13:19.180 --> 13:21.136
TRACY:
We ask that you rule

13:21.190 --> 13:22.964
on my client's
immunity, Your Honor.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.319
_ There is_ no suit here
if my client is found immune.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.622
I would agree.

13:26.670 --> 13:28.319
Thank you, Your Honor.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.804
No, I would agree that,
from all appearances,

13:30.850 --> 13:33.159
Mr. Riggs has had
his civil rights violated,

13:33.200 --> 13:35.896
but the question is whether
His Honor Schakowslq

13:35.940 --> 13:38.022
did so knowingly.
If he did,

13:38.070 --> 13:40.152
his immunity is stripped.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.723
The issue here concerns

13:41.770 --> 13:44.034
the contractual language
in the handbook?

13:44.080 --> 13:46.389
Actually, the issue
is free speech...
Yeah, and
the idea of original intent.

13:46.430 --> 13:47.681
Thank you.
Uh, we'll all get a lot further

13:47.730 --> 13:49.038
if we take this one at a time.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.342
Ms. Reed?

13:50.390 --> 13:51.732
Yes, Mr. Arbitrator, thank you.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.179
Geoffrey, please.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.869
Now, you claim
the handbook

13:54.920 --> 13:56.171
permits the school

13:56.220 --> 13:57.391
to defund its newspaper?

13:57.440 --> 13:58.998
Yes. Above all,

13:59.050 --> 14:02.133
Illinois _Parl_< is_commit_ted to
protecting ihdiVidual liberty.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.876
And Ms. Stowe's editorial
failed to take seriously

14:04.930 --> 14:08.752
the life experiences not just
of the Palestinian people,

14:08.800 --> 14:10.279
but of individuals
on Park's very campus.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.969
I wouldn't expect
a school like Park--

14:12.020 --> 14:13.976
or truthfully, any university--

14:14.020 --> 14:16.454
to use the fact
that it's privately funded

14:16.500 --> 14:19.890
to cut off debate about
how it treats its students.

14:19.940 --> 14:21.635
Although, technically, it can.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.898
Isn't the school
the publisher here?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.417
Yes, Geoffrey, it is.

14:25.470 --> 14:27.199
JASON:
You can't win this case.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.241
I know.
Not with
that argument.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.517
I know.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.471
It was a nice try, though.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.169
What do you mean,
not with that argument?

14:34.220 --> 14:35.608
Is there another argument?

14:37.310 --> 14:39.039
I came in here, and this campus

14:39.090 --> 14:40.478
is like a city.

14:40.530 --> 14:42.566
They've got
their own campus police,

14:42.620 --> 14:44.303
they've got medical facilities,

14:44.360 --> 14:45.964
food.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.489
They have their own power
plant, did you know that?

14:47.530 --> 14:49.316
I didn't.
But I'm not sure...

14:49.360 --> 14:52.056
Have you heard of
Evans v. Newton?

14:52.100 --> 14:53.795
"State actor"?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.057
Yeah.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.197
Who are you?

14:58.240 --> 14:59.719
[chuckles]

14:59.760 --> 15:01.933
Just your friendly
neighborhood investigator.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.242
No, that's a deep backwater
of the law.

15:03.290 --> 15:04.587
Where did you get that?

15:04.640 --> 15:07.074
I dabble a bit
now and then.

15:07.120 --> 15:10.078
What do I have to do to get you
to come and work for us?

15:10.120 --> 15:11.724
I am working for you.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.385
No, in an office.
Full time.

15:14.430 --> 15:16.250
With a desk.
And lunches brought in.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.517
I don't like offices.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.255
Then without an office.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.439
I don't know.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.040
Make me an offer.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.526
After you pled "not guilty,"
Clayton, what happened then?

15:27.570 --> 15:29.174
The judge slapped me
with a six-ﬁgure bail.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.925
ALICIA:
And after arraignment,
did you appear

15:30.970 --> 15:33.188
before Judge
Schakowslq again?

15:33.230 --> 15:34.743
Yeah. Every couple months,

15:34.800 --> 15:36.279
they'd stick me in the van,
bring me over.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.708
I'd be all ready for the trial,

15:37.760 --> 15:40.058
and then the prosecutor'd
ask for more time.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.271
ALICIA:
And the judge gave it?
CLAYTON: He never even blinked.

15:42.330 --> 15:43.888
ALICIA:
Even though the
prosecutor was delaying

15:43.940 --> 15:45.237
to find
the same witness?

15:45.290 --> 15:46.712
CLAYTON:
Yes.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.112
TRACY:
Isn't it true,
Mr. Riggs,

15:48.160 --> 15:50.025
that this wasn't
your first criminal offense?

15:50.070 --> 15:51.981
Objection.
Mr. Riggs' past is irrelevant

15:52.030 --> 15:53.372
to Schakowslq's immunity.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.909
TRACY:
Goes to the issue

15:54.950 --> 15:56.941
of why JudgeSchakowsky
set bail so high.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.127
MATA:
Overruled.

15:58.170 --> 15:59.899
TRACY:
In fact, didn't the judge

15:59.950 --> 16:01.645
in that weapons case have
to issue a bench warrant

16:01.690 --> 16:03.169
because you missed
a court appearance?

16:03.220 --> 16:05.472
That was a few years ago.
I was young and dumb.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.738
I turned myself in
and I didn't screw up again.

16:07.790 --> 16:10.008
Didn't you agree to each of the
three continuances in your case?

16:10.050 --> 16:11.221
No.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.487
I never agreed.

16:12.530 --> 16:13.918
TRACY:
Really?

16:13.970 --> 16:15.312
Because I have transcripts
of all three hearings,

16:15.360 --> 16:17.533
and every one of
them clearly notes:

16:17.580 --> 16:19.536
"continuance
by agreement."

16:19.580 --> 16:20.979
DIANE:
In your brochure
for the school,

16:21.020 --> 16:22.715
you write...

16:22.760 --> 16:25.490
"Park intends to be
a city within a city.

16:25.540 --> 16:28.020
"A student can shop, dine,
and even go to a movie

16:28.070 --> 16:31.062
without setting foot
off the campus."

16:31.120 --> 16:32.326
Is that true?

16:32.380 --> 16:33.597
Indeed, Park is a good school--

16:33.640 --> 16:34.857
an excellent one, in fact.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.208
Thanks for pointing that out.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.559
But by taking over
these public functions,

16:38.600 --> 16:42.036
Park has effectively become
a "state actor"

16:42.080 --> 16:44.423
and should be treated like
a public school. Hasn't it?

16:44.480 --> 16:45.697
That is a reach.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.344
Not according to
the Supreme Court.

16:47.390 --> 16:48.607
Evans v. Newton,

16:48.650 --> 16:50.698
Marsh v. Alabama.

16:50.740 --> 16:52.526
MARTHA:
If I'm not mistaken,

16:52.570 --> 16:53.878
those cases are
about company towns...

16:53.920 --> 16:55.091
Yes, and that's exactly

16:55.140 --> 16:56.357
what Park has become.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.913
A state actor.

16:57.970 --> 16:59.449
You're saying: the more
the college takes on

16:59.490 --> 17:01.219
governmental responsibilities,

17:01.280 --> 17:03.965
_ the more it can be treated
like an arm of the government.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.750
Yes. But I'm not saying that,
the Supreme Court is.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.268
In which case
the First Amendment would apply.

17:09.330 --> 17:11.025
Yes, and Park cannot
censor its paper.

17:11.070 --> 17:12.230
Geoffrey, please...

17:12.290 --> 17:13.541
Hang on.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.596
LUCCA:
Mr. Bukovitz,
how many times

17:19.640 --> 17:21.369
have you appeared
before Judge Schakowslq?

17:21.430 --> 17:22.852
Lots.

17:22.910 --> 17:26.607
Did Judge Schakowslq
ever use his position

17:26.650 --> 17:29.039
to influence your representation
of a client?

17:29.090 --> 17:31.308
I don't even know
what that means.

17:32.830 --> 17:34.650
LUCCA:
Did he ever yell
to intimidate you?

17:34.700 --> 17:36.429
Did he ever badger you
to accept a plea deal?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.579
No.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.396
You know you're under oath,
Mr. Bukovitz?

17:42.450 --> 17:43.667
I-I do, Ms. Quinn,

17:43.710 --> 17:45.575
but I also know
Schakowslq is tough.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.235
He wants to move fast.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.793
But bond court
reqUIres it.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.499
Hmm.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.234
What does "tax" mean?

17:54.290 --> 17:55.678
What?

17:55.720 --> 17:57.369
LUCCA:
Tax.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.637
Not tax as in
income tax.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.159
But what does it mean

18:00.200 --> 18:02.020
when Schakowsky taxes you?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.246
On June 18

18:06.300 --> 18:08.461
of last year,
did you tell me

18:08.520 --> 18:10.476
that Schakowsky taxed you?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.433
I-I don't remember.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.640
LUCCA:
There were three
other witnesses.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.827
I have the affidavits.
Look.

18:17.870 --> 18:19.781
Sometimes--_
and I mean sometimes--

18:19.830 --> 18:21.786
Schakowslq flies off the handle

18:21.830 --> 18:23.388
and says things
that I'm sure he doesn't mean,

18:23.450 --> 18:25.441
like he'll tax your client.

18:25.490 --> 18:26.741
Meaning...?

18:26.800 --> 18:27.960
Meaning he'll raise
the bond amount.

18:28.010 --> 18:29.272
But it's very rare.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.276
LUCCA:
And what did he
raise the bond to

18:31.320 --> 18:33.140
the time
he taxed you?

18:33.190 --> 18:35.624
$250,000.

18:35.670 --> 18:37.285
LUCCA:
Thank you,
Mr. Bukovitz.

18:37.330 --> 18:38.934
Let me take the cross.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.629
It's a bad idea,
Your Honor.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.022
Not with this witness.

18:42.070 --> 18:44.152
Trust me.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.507
Your Honor.

18:45.550 --> 18:48.462
Is Judge Schakowsky
intending to question?

18:48.510 --> 18:50.592
I am, actually.
If Your Honor doesn't mind.

18:50.650 --> 18:52.299
I don't, but I imagine you know
all the reasons not to.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.648
SCHAKOWSKY:
I do.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.169
So I defer to your
better judgment.

18:55.220 --> 18:57.120
Hi.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.172
Hi.
[clears throat]

18:59.220 --> 19:01.780
Have you ever practiced
in front of Judge Falcone?

19:01.830 --> 19:03.047
Or Judge Marc?

19:03.090 --> 19:05.877
I... yes, a few times.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.569
If you checked the clerk
of the court's annual report,

19:07.620 --> 19:08.871
you'd see they
set bail, on average,

19:08.930 --> 19:10.090
about ten percent
higher than I do.

19:10.140 --> 19:12.017
Objection,
he's testifying.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.277
Could you rephrase, Your Honor?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.753
With pleasure.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.268
Did you know they set bail,
on average,

19:17.330 --> 19:18.888
about ten percent
higher than I did?
Your Honor,

19:18.940 --> 19:20.498
these are very
different cases.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.279
They were felonies and...
MATA:
Mrs. Florrick.

19:22.330 --> 19:23.547
Please don't interrupt.
SCHAKOWSKY:
Thank you.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.501
Did Mrs. Florrick
ever argue

19:25.550 --> 19:27.598
that I hurried her
too much in court?
Objection, relevance.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.335
SCHAKOWSKY:
It puts the motive
of the plaintiff

19:29.380 --> 19:30.597
in context,
Your Honor.

19:30.640 --> 19:31.811
MATA:
I'll allow it.

19:31.860 --> 19:32.849
BUKOVITZ:
Yes, she did argue that.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.161
Did you ever think

19:34.210 --> 19:35.723
I hurried you too much in court?

19:35.780 --> 19:38.340
No.

19:38.390 --> 19:40.119
Did you ever think
I set bail too high?

19:40.170 --> 19:41.694
BU KOVITZ:
No.

19:41.740 --> 19:42.866
SCHAKOWSKY:
Did you ever
thinkI badgered

19:42.920 --> 19:44.171
the lavwers or
their clients?

19:44.220 --> 19:46.529
No.
Did you ever observe me

19:46.570 --> 19:48.435
infringing on the civil
rights of anyone?

19:48.490 --> 19:49.707
No.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.047
SCHAKOWSKY:
Thank you, Mr. Bukovitz.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.352
Your Honor,
I also have affidavits.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.356
They're from dozens
of lawyers in my court

19:55.410 --> 19:57.310
supporting
Mr. Bukovitz's observations.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.758
MATA:
Okay, thank you.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.018
I don't need to hear
any more here.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.108
There's evidence that
Judge Schakowsky is busy.

20:03.150 --> 20:04.549
Perhaps even brusque.

20:04.590 --> 20:06.672
But not that he
exceeded his authority.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.541
In which case, his immunity
should remain intact.

20:09.590 --> 20:11.546
The motion to dismiss
is granted.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.113
[gavel thuds]

20:13.160 --> 20:15.503
[indistinct chatter,
music playing]

20:15.560 --> 20:16.902
Hey.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.383
Hey.

20:18.430 --> 20:19.988
How was Silicon Valley?

20:20.040 --> 20:22.508
[sighs]
It was warm.
Hmm.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.777
I was surprised
you were back.

20:23.830 --> 20:25.081
Why didn't you call?

20:26.700 --> 20:27.951
I came by.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.262
Alicia didn't tell you?

20:29.310 --> 20:31.653
No.
Huh.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.429
We need you on a case.

20:33.490 --> 20:35.185
Are you sure?

20:35.230 --> 20:36.618
I think Alicia was worried
about the money.

20:36.670 --> 20:37.967
What's the money?

20:38.010 --> 20:39.352
$20 raise.

20:39.410 --> 20:41.401
She was gonna check
with you about it.

20:46.020 --> 20:48.750
What did you do to her?

20:48.810 --> 20:50.198
No. Uh-uh.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.844
I was in California.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.982
Come on, you screwed
with her head.
No, I didn't.

20:54.030 --> 20:55.463
You did your smile thing.

20:55.510 --> 20:57.284
Your bedroom eyes B.S.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.376
"Oh, I'm just a guy's guy.

20:59.430 --> 21:01.295
I don't know
what I do to women."

21:05.650 --> 21:07.993
Lucca, look at me.

21:10.570 --> 21:14.085
I didn't do a thing.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.619
Seriously.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.748
[knocking at door]

21:32.290 --> 21:33.803
Bernie?

21:33.850 --> 21:35.454
What's up?

21:35.510 --> 21:37.592
Clayton Riggs still wants to sue
for his imprisonment.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.369
I know.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.331
We're revising our strategy
with Schakowsky.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.166
We already did.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.724
"We already did"?

21:45.780 --> 21:46.997
What does that mean?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.348
Clayton and me.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.164
I met with him
after you left court.

21:50.220 --> 21:51.778
I signed him as a client.

21:52.780 --> 21:55.692
You snaked him?
Yes.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.480
We're also suing you
for malpractice.

22:10.850 --> 22:14.411
Ms. Lockhart has argued that
Illinois Park is a state actor.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.155
We don't agree
with this characterization

22:16.200 --> 22:17.280
but think it's irrelevant.

22:17.330 --> 22:19.059
Even in public colleges,

22:19.120 --> 22:21.725
students don't have _
unfettered rights of expre55ion.

22:21.770 --> 22:24.284
Nothing my client has done
rises to a level of...

22:24.340 --> 22:26.114
"Schools are allowed
to prohibit anyexpre55ion

22:26.170 --> 22:28.240
"that creates material and
substantial disruptions

22:28.300 --> 22:29.722
"in school activities

22:29.780 --> 22:31.384
or invades
the rights of others."

22:31.430 --> 22:34.513
And do you have any evidence
of such invasion or disruption?

22:34.570 --> 22:37.175
_ MARTHA:
Mr. Bina2ir, you requested

22:37.220 --> 22:39.268
the school boycott Israeli goods
from the settlements?

22:39.310 --> 22:41.562
Yes.

22:41.620 --> 22:44.088
Endorsing them is endorsing
a decades-long occupation

22:44.140 --> 22:46.392
that has led
to thousands of deaths.

22:46.450 --> 22:47.792
And how did you feel
when the school

22:47.840 --> 22:48.920
decided to boycott
the products?

22:48.970 --> 22:51.928
I felt heard and respected.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.972
And how did you feel when Ms.
Stowe published her editorial?

22:54.020 --> 22:55.920
Under attack,

22:55.980 --> 22:57.754
disrespected,
unsafe.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.199
Here's what I don't
understand, Mr. Binazir.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.151
You're on a politically
engaged campus.

23:02.200 --> 23:05.112
How is this controversy
different from all the others?

23:05.160 --> 23:06.593
Black Lives Matter?

23:06.640 --> 23:07.766
The Iraq War?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.469
It's never got physical before.

23:09.510 --> 23:12.035
Uh, my roommate was pushed
to the ground and stepped on

23:12.080 --> 23:13.422
just trying to get to class.

23:13.470 --> 23:14.994
Okay, got it.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.382
Ms. Lockhart?

23:16.430 --> 23:17.738
DIANE:
Ms. Stowe,

23:17.780 --> 23:20.954
was it your intent
to disrupt student activities?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.695
Not at all.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.435
Was it your intent to infringe
on the rights of other students?

23:24.490 --> 23:26.617
No, I was just
speaking my mind,

23:26.660 --> 23:28.446
trying to engage them.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.095
It's important for someone
to present a contrary viewpoint.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.142
At any cost?
No.

23:33.190 --> 23:34.441
But to be fair,
the disruption

23:34.500 --> 23:35.831
Saum is describing
was temporary.

23:35.890 --> 23:38.586
People are already
settling down.

23:38.630 --> 23:40.143
And in a few days, they'll
be on to the next crusade.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.282
But you won't,
because the only

23:42.330 --> 23:44.764
permanent disruption here
is leaving the school

23:44.810 --> 23:47.938
without a freely
functioning newspaper.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.158
ALICIA:
I did not commit malpractice.

23:52.210 --> 23:53.859
It's not about you,
it's about a payday.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.719
A $1.2 million payday.

23:55.780 --> 23:57.031
What's our malpractice cap?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.729
$300,000.

23:58.780 --> 23:59.906
Oh, God.

23:59.960 --> 24:00.904
It was all we
could afford.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.086
So we fight.

24:02.130 --> 24:03.119
What do they have?

24:03.180 --> 24:04.477
I don't know.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.997
We should put
an investigator on it.

24:06.050 --> 24:07.210
Should I call Jason?

24:08.530 --> 24:09.519
I don't know.

24:09.570 --> 24:10.878
He's probably too expensive.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.046
We can probably
talk him down.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.089
I met him last night.

24:14.060 --> 24:15.869
Why?

24:15.930 --> 24:17.830
He's a friend.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.666
How close a friend?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.494
Seriously?

24:22.540 --> 24:24.019
Are you gonna hate
the whole world right now?

24:24.070 --> 24:25.674
What did he say last night?

24:25.720 --> 24:28.234
He said you were gonna talk
to me about his raise.

24:28.290 --> 24:30.326
I think we were both surprised
that you hadn't talked to me.

24:30.380 --> 24:32.245
Well, there was a lot going on.

24:32.290 --> 24:33.848
A lot that
would've been alleviated

24:33.900 --> 24:35.504
by having an investigator.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.778
What's going on, partner?

25:08.020 --> 25:09.715
Would you like to talk?

25:09.760 --> 25:12.547
I don't know anymore.

25:12.590 --> 25:14.546
Do you want me to talk?

25:18.250 --> 25:19.558
I was in love.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.989
He died.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.160
I found out he left me
a message that he loved me,

25:26.220 --> 25:28.609
but I didn't get it.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.521
Now I'm sick to death of...

25:36.880 --> 25:38.836
...everything.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.745
This apartment.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.143
This laundry.

25:43.190 --> 25:45.351
The fact that things get dirty.

25:45.410 --> 25:46.661
The law.

25:46.710 --> 25:49.361
Just... standing here.

25:52.110 --> 25:54.578
Sometimes I swear I just
want to go into my bedroom,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.803
pull the covers over my head,

25:57.860 --> 26:01.762
and never do anything
ever again.

26:07.950 --> 26:10.384
I'm drinking
like I never have before.

26:10.430 --> 26:13.479
And all I want to do
is have another one.

26:15.660 --> 26:19.084
And then everything
just gets swallowed up by

26:19.140 --> 26:22.701
more disgust.

26:22.750 --> 26:25.799
I'm not built
to be an unhappy person.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.479
I like laughing.

26:28.540 --> 26:31.236
I laugh like a banshee
at videos on YouTube.

26:31.280 --> 26:34.101
And then I just sit here

26:34.150 --> 26:37.972
alone in this stupid
little apartment...

26:38.030 --> 26:41.898
wondering what the hell
happened to my life.

26:41.940 --> 26:44.408
Was it all about
having two kids--

26:44.470 --> 26:46.938
who I don't even know
ifI like anymore--

26:46.990 --> 26:50.209
and just shoving them off
to be someone important?

26:50.260 --> 26:51.989
Seriously, was that the point?!

26:52.040 --> 26:54.122
Ijust...

26:54.170 --> 26:55.774
[crying]:
I-I hurt.

26:55.830 --> 26:57.991
And I-I-I...

26:58.050 --> 26:59.995
I want it over!

27:00.050 --> 27:02.268
I just want it to end!

27:02.310 --> 27:04.175
Ijust...

27:04.230 --> 27:06.448
I was loved.

27:06.490 --> 27:07.878
And it's...

27:07.930 --> 27:11.570
over, over!

27:11.630 --> 27:14.758
So why am I doing this?!

27:18.240 --> 27:20.231
[Alicia crying]

27:33.120 --> 27:36.681
Alicia...

27:36.740 --> 27:39.698
you are here

27:39.740 --> 27:42.129
because I need you here.

27:44.350 --> 27:46.739
I don't like people.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.261
But I like you.

27:51.840 --> 27:54.274
I don't even think
I like my brother.

27:54.320 --> 27:55.400
[laughs]

27:55.450 --> 27:57.532
He bothers me.

28:00.500 --> 28:03.549
I have no friends.

28:03.590 --> 28:05.546
I'm 30 years old

28:05.590 --> 28:08.195
and I don't...

28:08.250 --> 28:10.241
have a single friend.

28:11.510 --> 28:13.978
But I want
to be your friend.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.429
I mean, do you have
a ring or something?

28:16.470 --> 28:19.860
I'll commit.

28:19.910 --> 28:23.732
Because that's
the one thing you can choose.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.692
Me...

28:26.740 --> 28:29.959
here wanting to be your friend.

28:32.100 --> 28:35.706
Everything else
is just handed to you.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.401
All you have to do is say

28:38.450 --> 28:40.839
I'm willing.

28:45.810 --> 28:47.152
No, I'm-I'm serious.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.417
You have to say it.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.587
[laughs]

28:50.640 --> 28:51.766
[clears throat]

28:51.810 --> 28:52.765
I'm-I'm willing.

28:52.810 --> 28:53.856
Good.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.892
Now, I have to ask you this.

28:56.950 --> 28:59.555
Do you have any guns
in this apartment?

28:59.600 --> 29:01.591
[laughing]

29:03.690 --> 29:05.214
No.
Good.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.172
'Cause you scared me there
for a minute.

29:14.140 --> 29:16.529
You're gonna
have to testify.

29:19.140 --> 29:21.791
I know.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.365
But you're gonna need
another lavwer.

29:24.410 --> 29:27.584
VVho?

29:27.630 --> 29:29.279
Cary Agos, Your Honor,

29:29.330 --> 29:31.935
representing Alicia Florrick
in this matter.

29:35.730 --> 29:36.674
Cary Agos, Your Honor,
representing

29:36.730 --> 29:39.028
Alicia Florrick in this matter.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.116
So the plaintiff is
now the defendant.

29:41.170 --> 29:44.037
A witness is now
Mr. Riggs' attorney.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.036
There seems to be _
a round of mUSICaI chairs

29:46.080 --> 29:47.729
while I wasn't looking.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.429
Yes, Your Honor,
I spoke to Clayton,

29:49.480 --> 29:52.085
_and he wants to sue
his lawyer, Mrs. Florrick.

29:52.130 --> 29:54.303
And I guess you, Mrs. Florrick,
you would move for dismissal?

29:54.350 --> 29:55.749
CARY:
Yes, we would,
Your Honor.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.610
Okay, this is exciting.
Let's go.

29:57.660 --> 29:59.571
Before the music stops and
we're all in different chairs.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.839
Who knows? I may be
the plaintiff next.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.609
BUKOVITZ:
So, Clayton,
did Mrs. Florrick

30:04.670 --> 30:07.093
ever take the time to consult
With you about your plea?

30:07.150 --> 30:09.141
Maybe 15 seconds.

30:09.190 --> 30:10.270
Your bail?

30:10.330 --> 30:11.399
The judge set it.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.234
She tried to say something,

30:13.280 --> 30:14.679
then she got nervous.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.449
She didn't try to slow
the proceedings down

30:16.510 --> 30:17.761
or explain to you
what was happening

30:17.810 --> 30:19.243
and what your options were?
No.

30:19.290 --> 30:21.019
No more questions,
Your Honor.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.332
Your current lawyer,
Bernie Bukovitz,

30:23.380 --> 30:25.507
he isn't actually
your new lavwer, is he?

30:25.560 --> 30:27.118
What do you mean?

30:27.170 --> 30:29.775
He represented you in front
of Judge Schakowslq before.

30:29.820 --> 30:30.991
Oh, yeah, right.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.348
He was my fourth lawyer.

30:32.390 --> 30:34.085
CARY:
And he didn't help
you out any more

30:34.130 --> 30:35.916
than Alicia Florrick
did, did he?
No.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.690
CARY: I'm sure everyone has
sympathy for you, Mr. Riggs.

30:38.740 --> 30:40.526
But isn't this really
a case of bad luck?

30:40.570 --> 30:43.095
And you just wanting to--
as you said

30:43.140 --> 30:45.392
to Mrs. Florrick-- sue somebody?

30:48.230 --> 30:51.358
I just want to get out.

30:51.410 --> 30:53.799
SCHAKOWSKY:
Yes, Mrs. Florrick

30:53.850 --> 30:55.977
started as a bond lawyer
in my court.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.284
And did you have an opinion
about her professionalism

30:58.330 --> 31:00.935
of lack thereof?

31:00.980 --> 31:02.720
Objection--
calls for a conclusion.

31:04.380 --> 31:07.201
[quietly]:
Expert witness.

31:07.250 --> 31:08.683
Your Honor, the judge
is an expert witness.

31:08.730 --> 31:09.776
He's allowed _
to express his opinion.

31:09.820 --> 31:12.334
Sustained. You may answer.

31:12.390 --> 31:14.255
SCHAKOWSKY: Yes, Mrs. Florrick
did not demonstrate

31:14.300 --> 31:16.518
the duty of care I would expect.
BUKOVITZ: And if she had?

31:16.570 --> 31:18.561
If she had informed me
promptly and effICIently,

31:18.610 --> 31:21.875
I might've had a better context
to set Mr. Riggs' bail.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.342
BUKOVITZ: Should you have
done more to try to pull

31:23.400 --> 31:24.560
that information out of her?

31:24.620 --> 31:25.609
SCHAKOWSKY:
My role is to adjudicate.

31:25.660 --> 31:28.049
Not advocate.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.314
All right, well, I went
through the transcripts

31:31.360 --> 31:33.578
from Schakowsky's courtroom,
looking for abuses,

31:33.630 --> 31:36.588
looking for any mention
of taxing lavwers.

31:36.630 --> 31:37.790
And?

31:37.850 --> 31:38.930
Nothing.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.289
Not a single mention of taxing.

31:41.330 --> 31:42.979
He always covers the
microphone when he says it.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.543
Yep, that's kind of
what I figured.

31:44.590 --> 31:45.898
So, what, we're screwed?

31:45.940 --> 31:47.191
No.

31:47.250 --> 31:50.071
I talked to his
courtroom reporter.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.816
She hears everything.
Darla.

31:52.860 --> 31:54.646
A very nice lady.
She goes to the track

31:54.690 --> 31:56.863
every weekend.
It turns out

31:56.910 --> 31:59.993
Schakowslq talks really fast,
so she started recording him

32:00.040 --> 32:01.473
so she could
get every word.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.509
And you have the tapes?

32:02.570 --> 32:05.209
I do.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.440
I wasn't myself earlier.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.409
Things were swirling
around in my head.

32:16.450 --> 32:18.532
And now they're not?

32:18.580 --> 32:21.458
Well, now they're
in perspective.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.718
Good.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.455
Perspective is good.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.149
I just, I didn't want
you to think that...

32:27.200 --> 32:29.760
Here's the thing, Alicia.

32:29.810 --> 32:33.155
Whenever you worry about
what I might be thinking,

32:33.210 --> 32:36.725
or you worry that I'm upset
about what you're thinking,

32:36.780 --> 32:39.943
just know that... I'm fine.

32:41.820 --> 32:43.959
Even when I'm not fine,

32:44.000 --> 32:45.956
I'm really fine.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.611
I got to go.

33:17.950 --> 33:19.941
Are you still fine?

33:22.340 --> 33:24.342
Yeah.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.522
CARY: Do you remember
when Mr. Bukovitz mentioned

33:38.580 --> 33:40.002
that you taxed attorneys,
Your Honor?

33:40.060 --> 33:41.357
I do.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.184
Is that a term
you regularly use?

33:43.230 --> 33:44.709
Only when discussing
my income.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.489
[chuckles]

33:46.540 --> 33:48.974
CARY: But not in the context
of punishing an attorney

33:49.020 --> 33:50.271
for not doing
what you want.
No.

33:50.330 --> 33:51.718
Not that I recall.
Good.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.844
Then maybe this will
refresh your recollection.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.856
SCHAKOWSKY: I simply want
a plea, guilty or not guilty.

33:57.900 --> 33:59.674
MAN: Uh, I-I need a moment
to actually confer with my...

33:59.730 --> 34:01.152
Objection!

34:01.210 --> 34:03.030
You're a witness,
you can't object.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.206
SCHAKOWSKY:
I already warned you.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.421
Objection, this is hearsay.

34:05.470 --> 34:06.641
There's no foundation.

34:06.690 --> 34:08.078
CARY:
We have an affidavit

34:08.130 --> 34:09.552
from the person
who recorded this audio.

34:09.610 --> 34:11.475
MAN: Yeah, I understand,
ifI could just...

34:11.520 --> 34:12.475
SCHAKOWSKY:
I'm taxing you and your...

34:12.520 --> 34:13.828
None of that matters.

34:13.870 --> 34:15.599
I did not consent
to being recorded.

34:15.660 --> 34:17.787
Two-party consent
isn't required.

34:17.830 --> 34:20.572
Standard two-party consent
isn't required but mine is.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.178
That was recorded
in my courtroom

34:22.230 --> 34:24.573
where I forbid the use
of recording devices.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.099
It is the equivalent
of you being recorded

34:26.150 --> 34:27.572
right now
in your court.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.497
I agree, this tape
is inadmissible.

34:30.540 --> 34:33.532
Your Honor, that is
completely self-serving.

34:33.590 --> 34:36.969
No, Mrs. Florrick,
this is a matter of respect.

34:37.030 --> 34:38.759
The tapes are excluded.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.596
MARTHA:
Dean Randolph,

34:41.640 --> 34:43.414
does the student handbook say,

34:43.470 --> 34:45.244
"Park is dedicated
to empowering students

34:45.300 --> 34:47.109
"by encouraging autonomy

34:47.170 --> 34:49.513
and the development
of personal responsibility"?

34:49.560 --> 34:52.028
It does.
And did the student body
demonstrate this responsibility

34:52.090 --> 34:54.513
in their reaction to
Ms. Stowe's editorial?

34:54.570 --> 34:56.959
Oh, yes, they're the ones who
petitioned the student council

34:57.000 --> 34:58.786
to have Ms. Stowe removed
and the paper defunded.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.616
This was entirely
a student body move?

35:00.660 --> 35:03.049
Yes.
Thank you, Dean.

35:03.100 --> 35:06.479
Do you agree with the way the
students handled Imogen's op-ed?

35:06.530 --> 35:07.929
I do.

35:07.970 --> 35:09.403
And if you didn't?

35:09.450 --> 35:10.758
Well, if the council voted

35:10.800 --> 35:12.188
one way or the other,
I'd respect it.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.571
Part of learning
how to make decisions

35:13.630 --> 35:15.450
is learning how to live
with poor decisions.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.582
DIANE: Last Halloween,
you disciplined a student

35:17.630 --> 35:19.757
for wearing a "Caitlyn" costume,

35:19.810 --> 35:21.937
which you said made
fun of trans students.

35:21.980 --> 35:23.629
You did, not the
student council.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.114
Well, no one brought a petition
to the student council,

35:26.160 --> 35:27.593
but that didn't mean
that the...

35:27.640 --> 35:29.596
Yes, but before the council
acts, after it acts,

35:29.640 --> 35:31.779
whether it acts
at all, you do.

35:31.820 --> 35:34.732
The final responsibility rests
with the adult faculty,

35:34.780 --> 35:37.214
not the students.
MARTHA:
If we could just look at chapter
three of the student handbook...

35:37.260 --> 35:39.820
I think we've all heard enough
about the handbook, Ms. Reed.

35:39.870 --> 35:42.134
Ms. Lockhart is right.

35:42.180 --> 35:44.489
The administration is
really still in charge,

35:44.530 --> 35:47.169
and since we're considering
them state actors,

35:47.230 --> 35:49.926
they can't censor the newspaper.

35:49.970 --> 35:52.928
The defunding of the student
paper is hereby reversed.

35:52.970 --> 35:54.756
Have a nice day, everyone.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.268
We're adjourned.

35:59.060 --> 36:02.496
Every attorney who comes to bond
court has a learning curve,

36:02.550 --> 36:06.281
but Mrs. Florrick's curve wasn't
about being a good advocate.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.855
What do you mean?
Well, she knew her way
around a courtroom.

36:08.900 --> 36:12.290
Judge Schakowsky liked
to call her Marie Antoinette,

36:12.340 --> 36:14.296
but she wasn't afraid
to get her hands dirty

36:14.340 --> 36:16.126
or ask for help
when she needed it.

36:16.170 --> 36:18.946
CARY: So what kind
of learning curve was she on?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.036
Figuring out how to deal
with Schakowsky.

36:21.090 --> 36:23.433
CARY:
Thank you.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.732
BUKOVITZ: So you're saying
Mrs. Florrick was as diligent

36:25.790 --> 36:27.519
as any other lavwer
in bond court?

36:27.570 --> 36:29.265
Yes, Bernie, I am saying that.

36:29.310 --> 36:31.266
Even though she had all sorts
of other obligations?

36:31.310 --> 36:34.529
I mean, wife of a governor
who was running for president.

36:34.580 --> 36:36.445
I think she handled it
with aplomb.

36:36.490 --> 36:38.924
Even though she missed
a whole morning at bond court?

36:38.970 --> 36:41.757
18 cases we had to cover,

36:41.800 --> 36:45.759
so she could tape an episode
of Mama's Homespun Cooking.

36:45.810 --> 36:47.584
LUCCA: I'm not saying she didn't
have to make trade-offs.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.414
BUKOVITZ: Trade-offs are one
thing, but what about the time

36:49.460 --> 36:50.802
you had to rush out of
Judge Schakowsky's court

36:50.860 --> 36:51.804
to cover a probate case of hers?

36:51.860 --> 36:53.464
That was because of you, Bernie.

36:53.510 --> 36:55.205
Because you didn't show up.
N-N-No, it wasn't my day.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.592
LUCCA: It was your day...
BUKOVITZ: You had given me...

36:56.640 --> 36:57.857
MATA:
Okay, thank you.

36:57.910 --> 36:59.252
Thank you!

37:00.690 --> 37:02.681
MATA:
Any more questions, Counselor?

37:02.740 --> 37:04.514
Just one more.

37:04.570 --> 37:08.995
Didn't you tell Don Weingarten,
another bond attorney,

37:09.050 --> 37:11.564
that you feel sorry
for anyone who gets

37:11.620 --> 37:13.429
Alicia Florrick as an attorney?

37:15.710 --> 37:17.666
I did.

37:17.710 --> 37:20.702
But I don't believe
that anymore.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.103
I wouldn't be
her law partner if I did.

37:33.290 --> 37:35.246
[knocking on door]

37:36.510 --> 37:38.637
You did end up with Will.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.648
You act like I prevented
the love affair of the ages,

37:41.690 --> 37:43.078
but you two did end up together,

37:43.130 --> 37:45.030
and I did not keep you
from doing that.

37:45.080 --> 37:48.038
Yes, I know I erased it,
and I've already apologized.

37:48.090 --> 37:49.773
And maybe you
would have had

37:49.830 --> 37:51.047
another three months together,

37:51.090 --> 37:52.261
but that would have
had no impact

37:52.310 --> 37:54.210
on what happened to Will, none.

37:54.270 --> 37:55.783
You can't control fate.

37:55.830 --> 37:58.219
Just like I can't tell if
I walked under that tree

37:58.270 --> 38:00.613
and not this one, uh, the branch
wouldn't break off and kill me.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.002
And one more thing.

38:04.150 --> 38:05.924
It was hard for me to apologize.

38:05.970 --> 38:07.926
I never do that.

38:07.980 --> 38:10.323
And I never confess to anything.

38:10.370 --> 38:12.759
But I did to you.

38:12.810 --> 38:16.769
Because I'm sorry.

38:16.810 --> 38:18.801
I'm so sorry.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.812
I've never been more sorry
about anything in my life.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.606
Okay, Eli.

38:29.650 --> 38:31.470
You're forgiven.

38:35.310 --> 38:36.652
[sighs]

38:36.700 --> 38:38.088
Really?

38:38.140 --> 38:40.096
Yes.

38:40.140 --> 38:42.483
I'll talk to you later, okay?

39:00.200 --> 39:01.599
So what do you think?

39:01.640 --> 39:04.416
There's not enough here
for malpractice.

39:04.470 --> 39:06.244
He'_|| sustain _
our motion to dismiss.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.074
And if he doesn't?

39:08.120 --> 39:10.076
We sit down
and offer to settle.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.165
BAILIFF:
All rise.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.431
I find there is enough here
to go to trial.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.436
The motion to dismiss is denied.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.913
[gavel slams]

39:25.230 --> 39:27.004
BUKOVITZ:
$1.5 million.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.391
Oh, come on.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.611
Bernie, you know
how this works.

39:30.670 --> 39:33.059
You're never getting
$1.5 million in a verdict,

39:33.100 --> 39:35.489
and you're never getting
$1.5 million from us.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.360
So what can you accept?

39:37.410 --> 39:39.753
$1.5 million.

39:39.810 --> 39:42.062
And I disagree that I
won't get it at trial.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.509
I might even get more.

39:43.550 --> 39:44.938
You're not well-liked, Alicia.

39:44.990 --> 39:46.378
LUCCA: Well, we'll
see you in court.

39:46.420 --> 39:47.853
BUKOVITZ: People
think you're rich.

39:47.900 --> 39:49.288
You're the wife of the governor

39:49.340 --> 39:50.944
and_the l_oser in the
preSIdential primary.

39:50.990 --> 39:53.641
He's not well-liked either.

39:53.690 --> 39:57.035
$1.5 million.

39:57.090 --> 39:58.569
Nice talking to you.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.049
[laughs]

40:06.090 --> 40:08.911
You've lost it,
haven't you?

40:08.970 --> 40:11.313
Oh, yes, I have.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.668
Good news?

40:12.710 --> 40:14.052
ALICIA:
No. No, no, no.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.442
Very bad news,
actually.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.365
Yep, we got shafted

40:17.410 --> 40:19.184
by the brotherhood of the robe.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.196
Our insurance doesn't even
come close to covering this.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.583
And we won't be able
to afford our lavwer.

40:23.630 --> 40:27.373
Last I looked,
you two were lavwers.

40:27.420 --> 40:28.762
[chuckles]
Yes.

40:28.810 --> 40:30.596
Two tired lawyers.

40:30.640 --> 40:31.811
I'm heading home.
Okay.

40:31.860 --> 40:32.895
We'll talk tomorrow.

40:32.950 --> 40:34.338
Yep.

40:34.380 --> 40:35.460
I should go, too.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.851
No, you should stay.

40:36.910 --> 40:39.606
You should think things
through with Alicia.

40:44.220 --> 40:45.562
Are you still fine?

40:45.610 --> 40:47.043
Yeah.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.689
[door closes]

40:50.750 --> 40:52.524
So a funny thing
happened yesterday.

40:52.580 --> 40:53.968
In the elevator?

40:54.010 --> 40:57.400
Yeah. No, um,
before that.

40:57.450 --> 40:59.793
I got offered a job
at Lockhart/Agos.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.889
I said no, but they
offered a lot of money.

41:02.930 --> 41:04.454
And then you said yes.

41:04.500 --> 41:08.459
No, because I didn't
want to make it seem

41:08.500 --> 41:10.889
like it was about
us yesterday.

41:10.940 --> 41:12.896
Ah, I see.

41:12.940 --> 41:17.297
Well, you should do
what's best for you.

41:17.340 --> 41:21.253
Yeah, well, sometimes I
can't tell what that is.

41:21.300 --> 41:26.124
Well, it usually involves
seeing which number is higher.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.471
[chuckles]

41:38.360 --> 41:40.351
[phone ringing]

41:48.370 --> 41:50.361
Yes.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.514
So that didn't
end well, did it?

42:03.560 --> 42:05.425
No.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.776
I heard from Lucca,
they don't want to settle.

42:09.830 --> 42:12.788
They don't.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.878
And you're looking
for a new place of business?

42:14.920 --> 42:16.694
Yes.

42:16.750 --> 42:18.138
Homeowners' association.

42:18.180 --> 42:19.579
Oh.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.394
And we're looking
for new associates.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.831
Lost half in a bit
of a rebellion.

42:25.890 --> 42:27.278
Oh, God.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.662
What?

42:28.720 --> 42:30.187
Would it be so bad to come back?

42:30.240 --> 42:31.582
As an associate?

42:31.630 --> 42:33.450
No.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.842
You want me back
as a partner?

42:34.900 --> 42:36.674
Diane would not want
me back as a partner.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.540
A junior partner.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.933
[chuckles]

42:40.990 --> 42:42.764
You guys fired me.
No, we didn't.

42:42.820 --> 42:44.594
That was Dipple.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.983
And, anyway, his people
like you a lot more

42:47.040 --> 42:48.553
now that Peter lost
the nomination, so...

42:48.600 --> 42:50.556
[both chuckle]

42:50.610 --> 42:51.554
[sighs]

42:51.610 --> 42:52.952
Look.

42:54.440 --> 42:57.819
We can help you cover
any loss you experience.

42:57.870 --> 43:00.134
Make it a part
of your settlement.

43:00.180 --> 43:03.047
Come on, Alicia.

43:05.100 --> 43:06.488
Come on home.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.485
[man trills tongue, hums]

43:08.540 --> 43:09.484
[chuckles]

43:09.540 --> 43:11.496
I found me a woman

43:11.540 --> 43:13.622
But she stands too tall

43:13.670 --> 43:15.626
I give her every inch
of my dream

43:15.680 --> 43:16.669
'Cause it's too small.
