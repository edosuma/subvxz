WEBVTT

00:07.964 --> 00:10.053
Oh, I love
your new fire pit, Calvin.

00:10.097 --> 00:12.534
Thanks. You know,
one night I looked over

00:12.577 --> 00:14.884
at Crackhead Victor's
trash can fire

00:14.927 --> 00:17.191
and thought, "That looks cozy."

00:18.453 --> 00:21.064
So, what are
we toasting to?

00:21.108 --> 00:22.457
Well, I know a
certain couple

00:22.500 --> 00:25.068
that has a big
anniversary coming up.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.287
Right, Calvin?

00:26.330 --> 00:27.244
Who?

00:28.419 --> 00:31.683
: I'm just
kidding, baby. It's us.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.207
It is us, right, babe?

00:33.250 --> 00:36.036
Come on.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.907
To 30 years
of marriage.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.604
Whoa!
Whoa!

00:39.648 --> 00:43.260
I can't believe you guys
have been married for 30 years.

00:43.304 --> 00:46.089
Wow. That means you got married
when we were only...

00:46.133 --> 00:47.264
Drink your drink, Gemma.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.442
Well, so how are you
guys gonna celebrate?

00:51.486 --> 00:53.401
Weekend in Cabo?
Couple's massage?

00:53.444 --> 00:55.664
Or our personal favorite,

00:55.707 --> 00:57.100
reading poetry to one other

00:57.144 --> 01:00.277
while maintaining
intense eye contact?

01:02.062 --> 01:05.326
It's like
a sexy staring contest.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.286
Okay, well, we'll
probably just do the usual

01:09.330 --> 01:10.461
and go out for dinner.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.377
Wha-- come on.
30 years is a milestone.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.379
You can't just go out to dinner.

01:15.423 --> 01:18.382
She's right, babe.
We should go big.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.036
Let's catch a movie, too.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.124
Ooh.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.779
Come on, you guys.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.563
You got to do
something more romantic

01:25.607 --> 01:27.435
than dinner and a movie.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.567
You know, we're not
one of those kind of couples

01:29.611 --> 01:32.135
to make a big deal
out of stuff like this.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.919
We didn't even
have a real wedding.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.921
Just the two of us
at the courthouse.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.836
I know what you guys
should do.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.622
You two should have
a ceremony to renew your vows.

01:40.665 --> 01:44.365
That's ridiculous.I love that idea.

01:44.408 --> 01:47.455
Tina, we already
did our vows.

01:47.498 --> 01:50.414
"Till death do us part."
You're not dead, I'm not dead.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.460
In the eyes of God,
we're good.

01:54.244 --> 01:57.160
You know what? Well, I want
this year to be different.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.031
I want the wedding
that I never had.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.990
Yay!:
All right.

02:01.033 --> 02:04.036
Dave, would you please...Yeah. C-Calvin, don't worry.
I got you.

02:05.255 --> 02:08.432
I would love
to be your best man.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.827
Yes.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.655
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:13.698 --> 02:14.960
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.836
Hey, Grover.
You want to help me

02:20.879 --> 02:22.185
and Miss Tina
plan her vow renewal?

02:22.229 --> 02:23.839
What's that?

02:23.882 --> 02:25.580
It's when
two married people decide

02:25.623 --> 02:27.625
to reaffirm their love...I'm out.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.025
Hey, Tina. Come on in.Hey.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.896
Thanks again
for helping me with this.

02:37.940 --> 02:40.247
Ugh, are you kidding?
I love weddings.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.074
The romance, the flowers,

02:42.118 --> 02:45.077
the jealousy on all
your girlfriends' faces.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.731
Okay, so where do we start?

02:46.775 --> 02:49.125
I thought we could look at my
wedding album for inspiration.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.258
Okay. Let's do it.Oh.

02:51.301 --> 02:55.044
Ooh. Oh, my God, Gemma.
You are so beautiful.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.219
Aw, thank you.

02:56.263 --> 02:59.091
Ooh, is that Ryan Seacrest?

02:59.135 --> 03:01.964
No, that's Dave.
He had frosted tips back then.

03:04.271 --> 03:07.622
You came down
the aisle on a horse?

03:07.665 --> 03:09.406
All my bridesmaids, too.

03:09.450 --> 03:12.931
Except Denise. She took a hoof
to the head at the rehearsal.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.716
Wow, Gemma.
Look at this reception.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.718
The centerpiece,
the cake.

03:16.761 --> 03:19.199
Calvin would never
go for this.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.418
But wouldn't he want
whatever makes you happy?

03:25.422 --> 03:27.381
Let me put it a different way.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.426
Would doing this make you happy?

03:29.470 --> 03:32.342
Well, I have always felt
that I kind of missed out.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.170
So let's fix that.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.260
You know, you're right. I'm in.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.218
I'm gonna have
the dream wedding

03:38.261 --> 03:39.784
that I never got.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.265
Ooh, and you know
what you should do?

03:42.309 --> 03:44.049
I'm not getting
on no damn horse, Gemma.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.442
No.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.274
Yo, Dave,

03:51.318 --> 03:53.276
you need to check Gemma.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.192
: Oh, no.
Not lice again.

03:57.715 --> 04:00.762
You know, I told her
to stop sharing hats.

04:00.805 --> 04:05.288
No. Gemma's putting
crazy ideas in Tina's head.

04:05.332 --> 04:08.465
I mean, look at the budget
for this vow renewal ceremony.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.772
Ooh, wow. She wants to
release a hundred doves

04:10.815 --> 04:12.295
after the "I do's"?

04:12.339 --> 04:15.298
I know. And if I pay
that much for birds,

04:15.342 --> 04:18.301
they better come with
mashed potatoes and a drink.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.087
Look, Calvin,
I-I know it's expensive,

04:22.131 --> 04:23.959
but don't you think
Tina's worth it?

04:24.002 --> 04:26.570
Of course she's worth it,
but that's not the point.

04:26.614 --> 04:30.357
I can do more romantic things
for Tina with this money.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.316
Well, like what?Like buy a Jacuzzi.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.580
Tina wants a Jacuzzi?

04:36.624 --> 04:40.236
A chance to soak in bubbles
with all this?

04:40.280 --> 04:43.195
Some things
are safe to assume, Dave.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.113
Okay. Well, look, if
you want to save money,

04:48.157 --> 04:49.332
I can perform
the ceremony.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.203
I got ordained online
so I could officiate

04:51.247 --> 04:52.727
my buddy
Kevin's wedding.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.337
Okay. You're hired.

04:54.381 --> 04:57.209
Now, look, next on the list
is a bartender.

04:57.253 --> 05:00.343
Now, I know Grover's
too young to drink alcohol...

05:00.387 --> 05:01.562
Mm-hmm.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.085
...but can he pour it?

05:06.436 --> 05:08.482
Hey, man. What's up?

05:08.525 --> 05:10.135
Hey, what are
you doing here?

05:10.179 --> 05:11.223
What does it look like?

05:11.267 --> 05:13.269
I'm grocery shopping.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.969
Oh, uh, tell Mom and Dad
they out of milk.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.233
So, what kind of gift
were you thinking about

05:21.277 --> 05:22.234
for their anniversary?

05:22.278 --> 05:23.627
Oh.

05:23.671 --> 05:27.370
I was just gonna sign
my name on whatever you got.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.764
So don't go cheap
and make me look bad.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.898
Malcolm, we can't
just buy something.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.901
You know?
30 years is a big deal.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.643
We got to, we got to get them
something from the heart.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.603
Okay. Like what?

05:42.646 --> 05:44.387
I'm glad you asked.
I was thinking

05:44.431 --> 05:46.607
we could sing their favorite
song at the ceremony.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.870
"Baby Got Back"?

05:48.913 --> 05:52.439
Not Mom's favorite song,
their favorite song.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.701
"Just the Two of Us."

05:53.744 --> 05:55.616
You know, that's not a bad idea.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.269
I mean, she did
always love it

05:57.313 --> 05:59.141
when we sang together
in those church plays.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.273
Right? Okay.
Let's give it a try.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.274
I'll lead you in.

06:02.318 --> 06:05.060
Okay.
Two, three, and...

06:05.103 --> 06:07.976
♪ I see the crystal
raindrops fall ♪

06:08.019 --> 06:10.195
♪ And the beauty
of it all ♪

06:10.239 --> 06:12.284
♪ Is when the sun
comes shining through ♪

06:14.243 --> 06:17.072
: ♪ To make those
rainbows in my mind ♪

06:17.115 --> 06:19.422
♪ When I think of you sometime

06:19.466 --> 06:23.426
♪ And I want to spend
some time with you. ♪

06:28.344 --> 06:31.478
I think my voice might've
changed a little since puberty.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.305
You think?

06:37.222 --> 06:38.572
Oh, hey, babe.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.574
Put that down. I want
to show you something.

06:40.617 --> 06:44.055
Ooh. Not right now, baby.
The boys are here.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.016
Not that something.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.191
This something.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.975
Ah. What's this?

06:51.019 --> 06:53.413
It's the new budget
for the vow renewal.

06:53.456 --> 06:57.242
Now, your man got creative
and saved us a ton of money.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.288
Holla!

07:01.943 --> 07:05.816
So you want to have our
vow renewal at Ernie's Hot Spot?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.688
And if we do it at happy hour,

07:07.731 --> 07:09.516
we get dollar drinks
and free wings.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.387
Double holla!

07:14.172 --> 07:17.132
Calvin, what the hell does
"neighborhood flowers" mean?

07:17.175 --> 07:18.786
Well, it just means
I take the roses

07:18.829 --> 07:20.396
from Miss Kim's front yard.

07:21.832 --> 07:25.445
So you're gonna steal flowers
from a 75-year-old lady?

07:25.488 --> 07:27.708
She's got glaucoma.
She won't know it's me.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.102
Really, Calvin?

07:31.146 --> 07:33.540
Free wings?
Stolen flowers?

07:33.583 --> 07:35.411
This is how much you love me?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.499
Wow.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.109
Babe.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.503
Look, I just don't understand
why we got to waste

07:40.547 --> 07:43.550
all this money on a day
we've already had.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.508
Baby, I just want
a nicer wedding memory

07:45.552 --> 07:47.989
than hearing a judge
next door scream, "Guilty!"

07:50.034 --> 07:54.430
Look, I would've liked to had
something nicer, too,

07:54.474 --> 07:57.433
but we had to get
married when we did.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.435
You were pregnant
with Malcolm.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.265
Excuse me? "We had to"?

08:03.308 --> 08:05.180
Come on.
You know what I mean.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.574
Now, I... I mean...

08:07.617 --> 08:10.577
You know, not "had to."
Of course I wanted to.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.056
You know.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.493
It w-- it was
the right thing to do.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.455
"The right thing to do"?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.848
Okay, hold on. Now, Tina...

08:20.891 --> 08:22.850
So the only reason why
you married me,

08:22.893 --> 08:25.548
because it was
the right thing to do?

08:25.592 --> 08:29.596
Okay, now, would you please stop
putting my words in my mouth?

08:31.293 --> 08:33.034
You know what, Calvin? I'm done.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.601
I'm calling this ceremony off.

08:34.644 --> 08:37.517
Not because I have to,
because I want to.

08:40.955 --> 08:44.524
She'd be a lot more relaxed
if we had a Jacuzzi.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.838
H-Hey.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.666
Did you sleep on the couch
last night?

08:56.710 --> 08:59.756
Mom and Pop got into a fight.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.281
She kicked him out of their room
and he kicked me out of my room.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.848
Why didn't you sleep in my room?

09:04.892 --> 09:06.284
'Cause I'm
a grown-ass man, Marty.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.460
I'm not sleeping
in a rocket ship bed.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.336
What were they
fighting about?

09:14.379 --> 09:16.599
Well, I don't know,
but it must've been pretty big

09:16.643 --> 09:18.775
'cause Mom called
the vow renewal off.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.777
Whoa.
Yeah.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.953
Are you sure it wasn't
because she heard you singing?

09:26.043 --> 09:28.132
Hey, boys.
Have you seen your mother?

09:28.176 --> 09:31.962
Uh, she and Gemma went shopping
and to get their nails done.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.965
Although I think the word
she used was "sharpened."

09:37.881 --> 09:40.144
Sounds like
you messed up big, Dad.

09:40.188 --> 09:43.017
Yeah, I guess I did.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.673
I know you boys are gonna find
this hard to believe, but, um,

09:46.716 --> 09:48.631
I said something stupid to her.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.372
What?
You?

09:50.415 --> 09:53.070
Please.
No.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.637
Yeah, it's true.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.986
Your father's not perfect.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.902
What? No.
You? Please.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.035
But it's gonna be all right,
all right?

10:01.078 --> 10:02.689
I know why she's mad
and I know

10:02.732 --> 10:04.386
what I got to do
to take care of it.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.431
Oh, you're gonna go ahead
with the vow renewal.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.564
No. I'm gonna wash her car.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.874
Well, at least it'll be clean
when she runs him over with it.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.484
Yeah.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.749
Look at all these
nail polish choices.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.751
"Midnight Temptress."

10:21.795 --> 10:24.319
"Vampire's Embrace."

10:24.362 --> 10:25.886
Ooh! I'm gonna get pink.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.673
Well, why is this one
so expensive?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.806
Oh, it has real
gold in it.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.417
Oh, Calvin would never
want to pay for that.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.462
So I'll take 20.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.901
You feeling any better?

10:40.944 --> 10:42.554
Not really.

10:42.598 --> 10:45.557
I can't believe Calvin actually
said the reason he married me

10:45.601 --> 10:47.037
was because I was pregnant.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.431
Well, if it helps,
back in Hickory Corners,

10:49.474 --> 10:51.651
that's the only reason
people get married.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.698
And all this time
I thought he did it

10:55.742 --> 10:57.265
because he was in love with me.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.832
Don't be ridiculous.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.138
Of course he was
in love with you.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.705
After we said, "I do,"

11:02.749 --> 11:05.577
he went up to the third floor
to pay a speeding ticket.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.191
Okay, he said something stupid,

11:10.234 --> 11:14.456
but you guys have been together
for 30 years and are so in love.

11:14.499 --> 11:17.938
That doesn't happen with people
who "have to" get married.

11:17.981 --> 11:21.637
I just wanted a wedding that
I could be proud of, you know?

11:21.681 --> 11:24.727
Well, maybe Calvin didn't give
you that, but he did give you

11:24.771 --> 11:26.642
a marriage
you could be proud of.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.210
I suppose.

11:29.253 --> 11:32.692
All I know is that when
Dave and I get to 30 years,

11:32.735 --> 11:38.393
I hope our marriage is as loving
and fun and supportive as yours.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.353
Although, I could use
a little less eye contact.

11:45.617 --> 11:48.229
Thank you, Gemma.
You're a good friend.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.276
You know, by the time
Dave and I celebrate

11:52.320 --> 11:53.930
our 30th anniversary,
you will be...

11:53.974 --> 11:55.192
Drink your drink, Gemma.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.069
Hey, Calvin,
what happened?

12:02.112 --> 12:04.027
I heard the vow renewal
was called off.

12:04.071 --> 12:07.596
Yeah. Tina wasn't too excited
about the budget cuts,

12:07.639 --> 12:11.774
and then we both said some stuff
I wish I could take back.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.518
Man, I'm sorry
to hear that.

12:16.561 --> 12:19.042
'Cause I found the sickest
Dave Matthews lyric

12:19.086 --> 12:21.958
to kick off
the ceremony.

12:22.002 --> 12:25.353
Wow, if I'd known that,
I would've canceled it myself.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.617
But it's okay.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.576
She'll be fine once she see
how clean her car is.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.929
Uh...
Calvin, you sure that's enough?

12:35.972 --> 12:38.061
No. I'm not stupid.

12:38.105 --> 12:41.151
That's why I'm gonna pop in
this new air freshener.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.722
Okay, Calvin, um, let
me ask you a question:

12:46.766 --> 12:48.898
What does it mean when
your brakes are squeaking?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.813
You need new brake pads.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.641
And your car
is backfiring?

12:52.684 --> 12:55.426
Uh, you probably need to check
your fuel injector.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.602
One more question,
you getting a bill.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.433
Okay, my point is,

13:02.477 --> 13:04.000
is you know how
to listen to cars,

13:04.044 --> 13:06.655
but I-I don't think you're
listening to your wife.

13:06.698 --> 13:09.832
No, look, I am listening, Dave.
It's just this...

13:09.876 --> 13:13.053
this whole vow renewal thing
is so unnecessary.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.837
Yeah, but sometimes the
things that are unnecessary

13:14.881 --> 13:16.708
are the things that
matter the most.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.972
Like what?
Well...

13:19.015 --> 13:21.322
Like these chrome rims.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.715
Do they make Tina's
car run any better?

13:23.759 --> 13:26.718
No, but they look good.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.851
What about the
leather seats?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.853
Come on now,
you've seen my wife's butt.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.812
I'm not putting that
on no cloth.

13:35.466 --> 13:39.731
Okay, so it sounds to me
like what you're saying is

13:39.775 --> 13:43.866
these things aren't necessary,
but they do matter.

13:43.910 --> 13:47.696
Hmm. I guess I am.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.698
Maybe you're right.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.309
Maybe I need to give
my marriage an upgrade.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.311
Yeah, man, come on.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.705
Bring it into the shop.
Put it up on the lift.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.359
Trick out that whip.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.887
You know, I think this is
the most manly conversation

14:04.931 --> 14:05.932
we've ever had.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.762
That really
warms my heart.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.243
And we're back.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.815
Whew, girl, I cannot believe
you dragged me

14:19.859 --> 14:22.383
to five different
beauty supply stores.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.775
What can I say?

14:23.819 --> 14:26.822
Dave's very particular about
his lavender bath salts.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.041
Ugh.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.826
Where is everybody?
Calvin, I'm home!

14:30.870 --> 14:33.655
Hey, Mom.Seriously, Malcolm?

14:33.698 --> 14:36.005
You'd rather put on a suit
than do your laundry?

14:37.659 --> 14:40.880
If you would just come with me
to the backyard.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.884
Do you know what this is about?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.886
Maybe.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.976
Is that why you squealed
when Dave texted you?

14:50.019 --> 14:52.979
Maybe! Let's go.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.863
Oh, hell no.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.386
Tina, wait!

15:10.387 --> 15:12.912
Look, babe, I know I messed up,

15:12.955 --> 15:14.783
but I just wanted
to let you know just...

15:14.826 --> 15:17.742
I'm not leaving. I'm just
going to change my clothes.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.962
I cannot get married
looking like this!

15:20.006 --> 15:21.746
Come on!

15:28.188 --> 15:30.364
I'm never
getting married.

15:30.407 --> 15:33.280
It takes too long
for girls to get dressed.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.325
I'm with you,

15:35.369 --> 15:38.981
but I'm watching
my mouth today.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.985
Are you ready
for our song?

15:43.029 --> 15:45.074
Don't worry about it,
man. I got this.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.902
You better,
because if you don't,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.600
I will drop you like
Beyoncé did Destiny's Child.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.389
Ooh, wait, they're coming out.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.540
Wow.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.293
Sorry it took me so long.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.556
I would've waited all night.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.689
We almost did.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.047
We are gathered
here...

16:49.791 --> 16:50.922
Give me a minute.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.449
Okay.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.928
Nope.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.020
Dave, I got it from here.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.938
Tina Butler,
love of my life,

17:06.982 --> 17:09.985
I still remember the
first time I saw you.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.988
You were singing on stage
at the Moonlight Lounge,

17:13.032 --> 17:16.383
looking almost as beautiful
as you are tonight.

17:16.426 --> 17:18.037
Oh, God.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.084
This is Kevin's wedding
all over again.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.564
Oh.

17:23.607 --> 17:28.090
When I first heard
your voice, I knew

17:28.134 --> 17:30.397
that I didn't just
want to be with you

17:30.440 --> 17:33.661
for the rest of my
life, I had to be.

17:35.663 --> 17:40.233
Well, I remember looking down
at you from the stage

17:40.276 --> 17:42.974
and seeing
the most handsome man.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.457
A beautiful smile,

17:47.501 --> 17:50.112
those bright eyes,

17:50.156 --> 17:52.506
and the shiniest Jheri curl
I'd ever seen.

17:55.204 --> 17:57.641
I was like a
sexier Rick James.

18:00.079 --> 18:04.083
Look, I know I say the
wrong thing sometimes,

18:04.126 --> 18:06.520
but the one thing I
never regretted saying

18:06.563 --> 18:09.000
was "I do."

18:12.134 --> 18:14.005
Me neither, baby.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.139
Dave.

18:19.968 --> 18:23.406
By the power vested in me
by MakeMeAMinister.com...

18:27.062 --> 18:30.283
...I proclaim your vows
of marriage renewed.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.154
You may now kiss the bride.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.141
Are you kidding?

20:30.185 --> 20:32.013
Add a banjo
and some hay on the floor

20:32.056 --> 20:34.537
and this is the
"Boot Scootin' Boogie."

20:34.581 --> 20:37.018
Yeah, but there's
one big difference.

20:37.061 --> 20:40.674
Yours is about the boots,
ours is about the booty!

20:40.717 --> 20:42.066
Hey!

20:42.110 --> 20:44.504
Oh, okay. Okay, y'all.

20:44.547 --> 20:47.681
Party's over. Leave your gifts
at the door and get out.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.685
Uh, Calvin,
it's only 8:30.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.861
I know, Dave,
but it's my wedding night,

20:53.904 --> 20:56.211
and Tina gets sleepy
around 10:00.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.691
TINA:
Oh, no.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.302
I'm up till
10:30 tonight.
Ooh.
