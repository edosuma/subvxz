WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.937
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:04.038 --> 00:05.673
I heard you're raising money
to study in Germany.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.908
Is that true?
Yes, but I'm not
having any luck.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.511
Oh, your luck's about to change.
Here's one week of my pay.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.646
Wow. Thank you.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.549
Mm. Whatever it takes
to get you on that plane.

00:16.584 --> 00:17.885
Missy's been sneaking out
of the house at night,

00:17.985 --> 00:19.720
and I'm worried she's going
to rob a mall.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.957
I also think she's smoking.
(exhales)

00:27.195 --> 00:28.696
I hate you.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.168
And please look after Sheldon
and I as we travel to Germany.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.936
"Sheldon and me."

00:36.036 --> 00:38.038
(sighs)
God doesn't care about grammar.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.308
You're not gonna be
on a ten-hour flight with God.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.942
I bet it's gonna feel
longer than ten.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.114
And please watch over George
and Missy while we're away.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.316
And thank You for the blessing

00:48.416 --> 00:50.284
of Mandy and Georgie's
engagement.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.420
Amen.
ALL: Amen.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.055
So, Moon Pie,
are you excited about Germany?

00:55.156 --> 00:56.524
Thrilled. Or should I say...

00:56.624 --> 00:58.559
For the love of God,
no more German.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.728
(whispers):
Hoch erfroeut.

01:00.828 --> 01:01.929
(sighs)

01:02.029 --> 01:02.930
So, uh, where's Missy?

01:03.030 --> 01:04.165
In her room.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.134
She's mad at me
for telling on her.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.568
And me for grounding her.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.503
Don't beat yourself up.
You did the right thing.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.473
Just give her some time,
she'll cool off.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.674
Yeah, you were pissed at me
all the time,

01:13.774 --> 01:14.908
now we're getting married.

01:15.008 --> 01:18.078
To be clear,
no weddings till I get back.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.614
Oh, don't worry, I haven't
even told my parents yet.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.517
Hmm?
I'm just waiting 'cause...

01:23.617 --> 01:25.319
Well, you've met my mom.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.820
Although, she's been
pretty sweet with CeeCee.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.358
Well, some people are better
grandmas than moms.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.360
Is that a swipe at me?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.761
Could be a compliment.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.929
Maybe I was saying
you improved with...

01:36.029 --> 01:37.565
Stuff it.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.066
I think you're
a wonderful grandma.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.601
You can stuff it, too.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.505
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

01:44.604 --> 01:47.208
* Yesterday I moved a mountain *

01:47.308 --> 01:49.577
* I bet I could be your hero *

01:49.676 --> 01:52.680
* I am a mighty little man *

01:52.780 --> 01:56.817
* I am a mighty little man. *

02:03.157 --> 02:04.525
(exhales)

02:15.836 --> 02:17.471
Missy?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.340
Look, I know you're not
speaking to me,

02:19.440 --> 02:22.476
but I'm going to be out
of the country for the summer,

02:22.576 --> 02:24.178
and I think we'd
both feel better

02:24.278 --> 02:26.079
if we parted ways amicably.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.250
We've never been away
from each other for this long,

02:29.350 --> 02:30.584
which will be different,

02:30.684 --> 02:33.120
and I don't like
when things are different.

02:33.221 --> 02:36.857
So I suppose
what I'm trying to say is...

02:36.957 --> 02:38.992
I'll miss you.

02:39.091 --> 02:40.728
(knocking on door)

02:55.609 --> 02:57.545
Do you really think
the back room needs

02:57.645 --> 02:59.213
all these security cameras?

02:59.313 --> 03:02.416
Well, I wanted a rottweiler,
you said no.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.452
We're not gonna
get robbed again.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.786
How do you know?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.521
I've taken precautions.
(door closes)

03:07.621 --> 03:08.989
Mandy around?

03:09.089 --> 03:10.190
No.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.025
Good, I found
an engagement ring.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.461
Oh, let me see it.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.664
Well, I-I don't have it yet.
It's a little expensive.

03:16.764 --> 03:20.067
Oh. Son, as a man
who's been through a divorce,

03:20.167 --> 03:22.536
let me give you some advice.
Here we go.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.204
Do not spend
a lot of money on a ring.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.973
But I love her.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.409
We all loved them
in the beginning.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.577
Does he have to be here?

03:29.677 --> 03:32.546
(laughs)
What do you want, honey?

03:32.646 --> 03:34.715
Well, I was hoping to get
an advance on my pay.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.116
Mm, how much you need?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.286
Next month
and the month after that,

03:38.386 --> 03:39.487
and, like, two weeks after that.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.690
Cubic zirconia. Look into it.

03:42.790 --> 03:43.691
Would you stop?

03:43.791 --> 03:45.125
She'll never know.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.160
No, I got to get the real thing.
It's important.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.663
Learn from him.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.235
What the hell is all this?

03:55.336 --> 03:57.571
Precautions.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.309
When we get there,
you'll be looking

04:01.409 --> 04:02.576
for "international departures."

04:02.676 --> 04:04.111
Ah, well, thanks
for letting me know

04:04.211 --> 04:06.714
that Germany's
in a different country.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.317
Is he joking?
I'd like to believe he's joking.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.851
He's joking, Sheldon.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.920
He's a football coach.
I don't know what he knows.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.624
Should I make her
take those off?

04:16.724 --> 04:18.726
Why? She's being quiet.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.728
I'm not gonna see her
for months.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.597
Well, I got to see her
every day. Let me enjoy this.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.400
Don't feel bad, Mom.
She's mad at me, not you.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.969
That doesn't make me
feel any better.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.606
What?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.274
Mom feels bad
that you're ignoring her.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.811
Good, I'm mad at her
for making me go to the airport.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.948
Mm. Feel better?

04:42.483 --> 04:45.152
Okay, we got diapers, wipes,

04:45.252 --> 04:49.156
change of clothes,
bottles, binkies, bibs.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.091
And we got your boobs,
so we're set on food.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.527
Okay, please don't
bring my boobs up

04:53.627 --> 04:54.895
when we're at my parents' house.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.564
Well, what if it
comes up naturally?

04:56.664 --> 04:57.698
It won't.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.300
Okay. Are we
forgetting anything?

05:00.401 --> 05:03.236
Well, just this.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.538
What are you doing?

05:04.638 --> 05:07.641
I know we're already
engaged, but...

05:07.741 --> 05:09.309
I wanted you to have this.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.780
(gasps)

05:12.880 --> 05:14.848
Oh, Georgie, it's beautiful.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.085
I don't know what to say.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.521
Thank you for asking me
to marry you.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.790
You're welcome.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.795
And also, when we tell people
the story,

05:27.895 --> 05:29.363
can we leave that part out?

05:29.463 --> 05:32.666
Why? 'Cause a woman proposing
to a man is embarrassing?

05:32.766 --> 05:33.933
Yeah.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.704
GATE AGENT:
Now boarding Flight 622,

05:36.804 --> 05:39.673
nonstop service to Frankfurt.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.108
That's us.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.578
Are you gonna be okay?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.280
Don't worry. Have a great trip.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.417
Oh, it's a long time.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.718
I'm gonna miss you.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.754
Mm. I'm gonna miss you, too.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.723
Great, can we go now?

05:55.823 --> 05:57.758
Not before you give me a hug.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.326
(sighs)
Fine.
Oh...

05:59.427 --> 06:03.163
I'm not gonna miss this
attitude, but I'll miss you.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.898
I'll miss you, too.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.300
Say goodbye to your brother.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.736
No, thanks.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.038
Just as well,
I don't care much for hugs.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.039
Whatever.

06:12.139 --> 06:12.740
Missy.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.708
Fine, bye.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.343
I'll be in the gift shop.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.779
Auf Wiedersehen!

06:25.385 --> 06:26.687
It's really coming down
out there.

06:26.787 --> 06:27.788
I don't believe it.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.056
Oh, don't worry.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.158
I'm sure they fly in much worse.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.760
What?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.762
The rain. It's gonna be okay.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.630
Oh, Dad told me
you might get nervous.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.365
There, there.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.534
I was trying to calm you down.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.902
Oh, I'm not nervous,
I'm excited.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.437
There's a celebrity
on the plane.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.405
Really? Who?

06:45.506 --> 06:46.807
Dr. Van Doornewaard.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.443
Oh. Who is that?

06:49.543 --> 06:50.711
You're kidding, right?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.412
He's the Dmitri Mendeleev
of physics.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.714
And he is...?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.549
Dmitri Mendeleev?
Oh, he is to chemistry

06:55.649 --> 06:57.317
what Pierre-Simon Laplace
is to...

06:57.417 --> 06:59.052
Got it.
He's a famous science guy.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.387
Mm.

07:00.488 --> 07:03.557
Look at him, sitting in coach
like a regular joe.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.625
I'm going to go
introduce myself.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.159
Uh, the seat belt sign is on.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.928
I think we're getting
ready to take off.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.897
(grumbles)
(sighs)

07:09.997 --> 07:11.965
It's okay. He's not
going anywhere.

07:12.065 --> 07:15.969
Ooh, I'm going to have him
autograph my vomit bag.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.405
I hope I don't have
to use it first.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.542
(chuckles):
Boy.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.143
Really coming down.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.814
Hello?

07:26.914 --> 07:28.148
What?

07:29.016 --> 07:30.317
What's going on with you?

07:30.417 --> 07:31.685
Nothing.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.220
Missy.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.556
Like you never messed up
when you were my age?

07:35.656 --> 07:36.824
Oh, I messed up plenty.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.291
Luckily, the Army
straightened me out.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.159
Maybe you should ship me off
to the Army.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.995
I'm sure that'll make
everyone happy.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.898
You know, that's not a bad idea.
What?

07:44.998 --> 07:47.300
Tomorrow morning,
you're up at 0600.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.268
Why?

07:48.368 --> 07:50.037
Yard work, cleaning the gutters,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.305
then you gonna help me
put bars on your bedroom window.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.474
(scoffs)
You can't make me do all that.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.976
Hmm. Cute how you think that.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.545
Why are you trying
to ruin my life?

07:57.645 --> 08:00.814
That's "Why are you trying
to ruin my life, sir."

08:03.016 --> 08:05.218
One question.
Yes?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.454
What's 0600?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.926
(wind whistling)

08:19.332 --> 08:21.001
Hey. Pastor Jeff.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.302
What you doing up there?

08:22.402 --> 08:24.171
Oh, I was installing
security cameras.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.906
You know, you can't be too safe.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.808
People rob laundromats?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.744
(games dinging)

08:30.844 --> 08:33.813
Yeah. All the time.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.182
I-I got to go grab something.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.018
So, help yourself
to a washer and...

08:38.118 --> 08:40.352
peace be upon you.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.623
And you as well.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.457
Thank you.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.560
Thanks.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.029
Pastor Jeff is out there.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.064
So?
So?

08:51.164 --> 08:52.866
He wanted to shut down
the video store.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.067
What do you think he's gonna do

08:54.167 --> 08:55.736
when he finds out
about all this?

08:55.836 --> 08:59.139
He's not gonna find out unless
you start acting all weird.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.509
Did you already start
acting all weird?

09:02.610 --> 09:04.144
Nah.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.546
Yeah.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.382
I'll handle it.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.922
Well, what a nice surprise.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.457
Hey there, Connie.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.360
Were you in that storage closet
all this time?

09:21.361 --> 09:22.863
Yes, I was.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.233
That's not weird.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.670
Well, that is a beaut.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.538
Yeah. He did good.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.540
So, when's the big day?

09:33.641 --> 09:35.709
Jim, back off. It's her wedding.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.144
Thank you, Mom.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.946
Sorry. Just don't do it in June.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.547
Got a big tire expo in June.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.683
Oh, don't worry, we got to
wait for my mom and brother

09:42.783 --> 09:43.984
to get back from Germany.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.285
And we're kind of
thinking something small,

09:45.385 --> 09:47.587
probably just down
at the courthouse.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.090
Well, I think that sounds great.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.192
So you guys are okay that
it's not gonna be a big to-do,

09:52.292 --> 09:54.461
and you can't invite
all your friends?

09:54.561 --> 09:56.163
More than okay.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.231
Oh, great. She
was all worried

09:58.331 --> 09:59.432
you weren't gonna
be okay with it.

09:59.532 --> 10:00.634
Well, I am.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.469
So, we're all happy.

10:02.569 --> 10:03.536
I'm happy.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.906
What do you mean
"more than okay"?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.407
No, I don't, I don't
think she meant nothing.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.810
Just that I agree with you,
under the circumstances,

10:09.910 --> 10:11.111
smaller is better.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.245
What circumstances?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.447
These cute little circumstances

10:14.547 --> 10:15.315
right here.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.650
So you're embarrassed

10:16.750 --> 10:18.051
for your friends to see

10:18.151 --> 10:19.386
we're getting married
and we already have a baby.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.054
AUDREY:
Of course not.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.923
They know you have a baby.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.224
They just may be
under the impression

10:24.324 --> 10:26.259
that you're already married.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.227
(scoffs)

10:27.327 --> 10:28.395
Let's get back to something

10:28.495 --> 10:29.629
we can all agree on.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.132
That ring. That's
a darn fine ring.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.334
Darn fine. Isn't it?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.605
Okay.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.412
(bell chimes)
Don't bother them, they're busy.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.280
They're flight attendants,
I'm on a flight

10:47.380 --> 10:49.415
and I need attending.
(scoffs)

10:49.516 --> 10:51.618
Can I help you?
Yes, when is the
seat belt sign

10:51.719 --> 10:52.886
going to turn off?

10:52.986 --> 10:53.987
As soon as the captain
thinks it's safe

10:54.087 --> 10:55.923
to move about the cabin.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.457
But you're moving
about the cabin.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.793
Because you pushed the button.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.094
We're sorry to bother you.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.462
Is there anything else?

11:02.562 --> 11:04.364
Yes, could you please tell
the man in 44E

11:04.464 --> 11:06.700
that I'm a huge fan
of his mirror symmetry theory?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.736
And he also may want
to consider applying it

11:08.836 --> 11:10.938
to enumerative geometry.
There's nothing else.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.272
Okay.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.108
I know that you're excited,

11:15.208 --> 11:17.244
but when that seat belt sign
does go off,

11:17.344 --> 11:18.912
you need to be respectful.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.281
That man may not want
to meet you...
(bell chimes)

11:23.717 --> 11:25.485
(sighs)

11:26.286 --> 11:27.320
Gin and tonic.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.621
Oh, I don't really...

11:30.623 --> 11:31.658
Thank you.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.866
(exhales)

11:38.966 --> 11:40.200
Come on. You don't have to go.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.735
Oh, yes, we do.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.537
'Cause we have a big
embarrassing wedding to plan.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.206
(scoffs) So now you're
doing this just to spite me?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.241
No, that's not what we're doing.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.810
That's not what
we're doing, right?

11:49.910 --> 11:51.544
We're gonna have a big wedding,
and we're gonna show

11:51.644 --> 11:53.380
everybody in this town
that we love each other

11:53.480 --> 11:55.215
and we don't care who knows it.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.217
So that is what we're doing.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.686
Okay, look, I think you both
just need to calm down.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.823
Yep. Knew it when I said it.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.758
Let's go.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.661
(wind whistling)

12:08.762 --> 12:10.097
(thunder rumbles)

12:10.197 --> 12:11.899
I don't think we
should drive in this.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.066
It's just a little rain.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.102
Amanda, you're acting
like a child.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.569
See you at the wedding.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.979
Could someone please
get me a towel?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.715
(alarm sounding)

12:28.816 --> 12:31.718
Okay, e-everybody, get away
from the window. Come on.

12:31.819 --> 12:34.254
Is there someplace
we can shelter?

12:34.354 --> 12:37.657
Should we move everybody
somewhere else?

12:37.757 --> 12:41.361
I thought you didn't want to
put you-know-who somewhere else.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.064
(shouts)
Okay, everybody, follow me.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.165
Come on.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.399
Are we all gonna fit in there?

12:46.499 --> 12:49.702
Maybe God will
provide a miracle.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.743
What is all this?

12:58.711 --> 13:00.280
A miracle.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.915
ANNOUNCER (over radio):
The National Weather Service

13:02.015 --> 13:05.418
has issued a tornado warning
for the following counties:

13:05.518 --> 13:09.789
Polk, Trinity,
Angelina, Nacogdoches.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.359
Dad, I'm scared.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.294
It's okay, we're almost home.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.329
Keep an eye out
for funnel clouds.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.298
What happens if I see one?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.700
Well, we get out of the car
and we lay down low

13:20.800 --> 13:22.102
till it passes over us.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.170
Get out of the car?

13:23.270 --> 13:24.972
Car can get picked up.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.173
It's safer on the ground.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.241
Okay.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.513
Dad, we need to get out
of the car.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.217
The National Weather Service...
(alarm sounding)

13:42.689 --> 13:43.957
Now, do you think
we're ever going

13:44.057 --> 13:45.558
to discover the
equivalence of heterotic

13:45.658 --> 13:47.494
and supergravity
string theories?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.129
You betcha.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.899
That would turn the theory
of quantum gravity upside down.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.901
Will anybody know?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.436
Was that a joke?
Yes.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.305
(both laugh)

13:59.172 --> 14:00.840
Would you like to switch seats
with me?

14:00.941 --> 14:02.375
Oh, no, I wouldn't want
to put you out.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.911
I'm spending the summer at
the University of Heidelberg

14:04.011 --> 14:05.345
studying superstrings.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.515
Wonderful. I'm actually
a visiting professor there.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.484
Then I guess I'll be visiting
a professor there.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.187
(laughs):
Very good.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.355
Get it?

14:15.455 --> 14:16.656
(laughs)

14:16.756 --> 14:18.325
(alarm sounding in distance)

14:18.425 --> 14:20.060
CeeCee okay?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.762
Seems like she's liking it
in here.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.064
Well, takes after me.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.865
It's my favorite room
in the house.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.668
Just so you know, we're not
paying for a big wedding.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.702
(thunder rumbling)

14:29.802 --> 14:31.004
Really? We might all die

14:31.104 --> 14:32.505
and this is what you
want to talk about?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.141
You've always been so dramatic.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.243
Okay, just so you know,
we don't need your money.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.777
We're gonna pay
for the wedding ourselves.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.280
Uh, actually...

14:40.380 --> 14:42.249
I thought you said
you were saving up.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.617
I was.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.153
Now it's on your finger.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.321
How much did you pay for this?

14:48.421 --> 14:49.689
All that matters
is that you're happy.

14:49.789 --> 14:50.924
How much, Georgie?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.960
Yeah, I'm a little curious.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.629
(gasps)
What?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.298
Now I'm real curious.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.101
They're not having
a big wedding.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.737
(thunder crashing)

15:04.837 --> 15:07.040
(alarm sounding)

15:07.140 --> 15:10.310
MISSY: Do you see it?
Keep your head down!

15:10.410 --> 15:12.445
(clattering, thudding)

15:16.349 --> 15:17.850
(wind whistling)

15:17.951 --> 15:20.253
I can't believe you're
running a gambling room.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.854
Well, it's keeping us safe
right now,

15:21.955 --> 15:25.292
so maybe the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.327
Ooh, that's good.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.663
Or maybe He sent that storm so
I could save all these souls.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.931
Ooh, that's good, too.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.134
(thunder crashes)

15:34.234 --> 15:35.602
MEEMAW:
Well, if you're gonna
save our souls,

15:35.702 --> 15:37.004
we're gonna have to survive.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.406
How about you put in
a word with your boss?

15:39.506 --> 15:41.574
Right. Everyone, hold hands.

15:41.674 --> 15:42.842
(thunder crashing)

15:42.942 --> 15:46.179
Dear Lord, please keep us safe.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.048
And not just those of us
huddled here

15:48.148 --> 15:52.552
in this establishment,
but all our loved ones,

15:52.652 --> 15:56.423
wherever they may be.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.358
Our family and friends.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.928
Please forgive us
our mistakes and our sins,

16:02.029 --> 16:04.864
and let us come
through this stronger

16:04.964 --> 16:07.434
and closer together
in our faith.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.701
Amen.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.671
It's getting quieter.

16:11.771 --> 16:15.075
(stammers)
It's moving away.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.209
You sure?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.444
Yeah, look. Look.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.312
Rain's letting up.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.383
Yeah.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.053
We're okay.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.355
(crying)

16:30.090 --> 16:31.924
Hey, hey, hey. It's over.

16:32.725 --> 16:33.960
I'm sorry.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.262
I'm sorry for everything.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.031
I've been awful.
I don't even know why.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.866
I really do love you and Mom,

16:39.966 --> 16:42.635
and I don't
actually hate Sheldon.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.538
I'll be better. I promise.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.806
I know you will.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.908
I love you, too.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.483
Where's the car?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.456
Glad we got out?

17:04.457 --> 17:05.825
(chuckles)

17:07.859 --> 17:10.896
MEEMAW:
Mary's house looked okay.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.233
DALE:
Boy, that was a big one.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.069
(gasps)

17:17.170 --> 17:19.872
Oh, Connie, I'm so sorry.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.551
Oh... Oh, my God.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.188
Oh... (groans)

17:35.288 --> 17:37.390
No one was in there.
That's the important thing.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.693
Mandy and the baby
could've been home.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.729
But they weren't.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.233
I mean, it's just stuff, right?

17:50.637 --> 17:51.904
And money.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.108
Oh, no. All my money.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.076
Oh-- Calm down. That...

17:57.177 --> 17:59.212
Don't tell me to calm down!
Help me pick it up.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.148
All right, all right.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.956
(line ringing)

18:12.225 --> 18:14.927
No one's answering
at your meemaw's house, either.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.830
Starting to get
a little worried.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.766
* *

18:25.872 --> 18:27.974
GEORGE JR.:
Hey, look at this.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.177
Me as a baby.
It ain't even cracked.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.679
That's great, Georgie.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.881
You know, you're welcome

18:34.981 --> 18:36.849
to stay with us,
long as you need.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.152
Thank you.
And don't worry, I'm not
sticking my granddaughter

18:39.252 --> 18:40.653
in the garage.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.690
You can have Sheldon's room.
Just don't tell Sheldon.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.158
Or touch anything.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.926
And Connie,

18:47.026 --> 18:48.261
obviously, you're welcome, too.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.197
Obviously.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.666
But I'm sure that Dale
was about to offer.

18:53.766 --> 18:57.136
I was gonna.
I'm just taking a break.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.241
So, if we find any jewelry,

19:01.341 --> 19:04.010
is it, like,
a finders keepers situation?

19:04.110 --> 19:04.877
No.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.913
(sighs)
Here.

19:09.782 --> 19:13.052
Connie, I am so sorry.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.987
Thank you.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.856
I want you to know,
I'm not gonna do anything

19:16.956 --> 19:18.791
about what I saw today.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.027
You've been through enough.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.563
It's been quite a day.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.565
Why don't I give you
a hand here?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.867
Anything special
you're looking for?

19:28.935 --> 19:31.738
A box of Raisin Bran.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.107
(quietly):
Well, okay.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.277
