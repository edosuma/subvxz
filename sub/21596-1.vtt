00:15.915 --> 00:17.316
This heat wave expected

00:17.318 --> 00:20.052
to continue for at least
another three days.

00:20.054 --> 00:23.355
Stay cool however
you can and make sure

00:23.357 --> 00:25.924
you're drinking lots of water.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.733
- Happy birthday, bear.

00:35.870 --> 00:36.769
Wake up.

00:42.475 --> 00:43.375
Surprise.

00:48.515 --> 00:49.581
Make a wish.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.589
- You didn't have to do that.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.958
- Don't get too excited,
they're whole wheat.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.726
- Yikes.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.794
- Mm, yikes.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.465
Ta-da!

01:06.467 --> 01:07.800
- What is this?

01:09.069 --> 01:11.437
You already got me
the trip to Miami.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.905
- It's just a little something.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.374
You know, for inspiration
while you're writing.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.275
Open it.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.748
- Oh, thanks, tiger.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.949
- You like it?

01:23.951 --> 01:25.417
- Yeah, it's really cool.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.318
- Good.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.155
Hey, guess what I started
taking this morning?

01:30.157 --> 01:31.190
- What?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.258
- The prenatal vitamins.

01:34.661 --> 01:37.763
- I thought we weren't gonna
start trying 'til September.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.565
- Yeah, that's next month.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.632
- Oh, right.

01:41.968 --> 01:43.302
- What's wrong?

01:45.138 --> 01:46.038
- Nothing.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.712
Wait, can you just lie
down here for a second.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.581
- I'm late for the
photo shoot, remember?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.316
And you should actually start
packing soon for your flight.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.218
I left you the shirt for
Carol's wedding in the bathroom

01:59.220 --> 02:01.053
so just don't forget it.

02:01.055 --> 02:02.254
- Okay.

02:02.256 --> 02:05.691
Wait, can I just smell
you before you go?

02:13.167 --> 02:14.066
Mm.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.269
You sure you don't wanna
just come with me now?

02:17.271 --> 02:18.437
- I can't, baby.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.872
It's just two weeks.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.840
It'll go by fast, okay?

02:23.309 --> 02:24.543
Diego.
- Hm?

02:24.545 --> 02:25.944
- Happy birthday.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.212
- I love you.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.413
- I love you.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.048
Call me when you get in, okay?

02:30.050 --> 02:31.283
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.115
- How ya doin'?

04:10.117 --> 04:11.350
Welcome.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.085
- Hey, checking
in for Diego Diaz.

04:13.087 --> 04:13.986
- Okay.

04:16.055 --> 04:16.588
Hey Vanessa.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.692
Okay, you're all set, sir.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.495
Here's your room key.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.396
- Thanks.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.265
- Hello?
- Hey.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.134
- Hey. You there?

05:02.136 --> 05:04.202
- Just checked in.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.404
- So, how is it?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.772
- It's great.

05:06.774 --> 05:07.706
You picked a good one.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.541
They got a pool and everything.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.044
- So, what's your plans
for the rest of the day?

05:12.046 --> 05:13.278
- I don't know.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.646
Was thinkin' about
maybe callin' Dave,

05:14.648 --> 05:16.281
maybe goin' out tonight.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.016
Or maybe just
laying low so I can

05:18.018 --> 05:20.652
wake up fresh
tomorrow and write.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.020
- Bear, I'm sorry
i couldn't be there

05:22.022 --> 05:24.456
with you on your birthday.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.290
- It's okay.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.325
How'd your shoot go?

05:26.327 --> 05:27.826
- Good--

05:27.828 --> 05:28.860
Oh, can we talk later?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.295
That's actually Callie calling.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.798
- Yeah, I'll call you later.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.965
- Okay.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.200
Ciao, chulita.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.601
- Adios, guapo.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.111
- Happy birthday.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.479
- What's up?

05:47.481 --> 05:48.480
- How you doin'?

05:48.482 --> 05:50.048
- Good.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.650
It's casual, but...

05:51.652 --> 05:53.785
- Oh, this
is Miami casual.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.953
- Want a cerveza?

05:54.955 --> 05:56.221
- Sure.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.789
Oh, this is a nice
place you got here.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.359
- Yeah, Mariana hooked it up.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.793
- Where is Mariana?

06:01.795 --> 06:04.763
- She's coming next weekend
for Carol's wedding.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.232
You remember Carol, right?

06:07.234 --> 06:09.401
- Yeah, that
was that blonde, right?

06:09.403 --> 06:11.703
- No, Mariana's ex-roommate.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.238
- Oh yeah, that's right.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.142
Let's have a toast to your
30th birthday, my friend.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.877
- Thank you.
- Salut.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.448
So, what you doing nowadays?

06:23.450 --> 06:25.584
- I'm working at a
hedge fund right now

06:25.586 --> 06:27.319
that Mariana's dad
hooked me up with.

06:27.321 --> 06:28.320
It's cool.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.755
It's keeping Mariana off my back

06:29.757 --> 06:32.691
and I'm making three times
more than I was waiting tables,

06:32.693 --> 06:36.061
but they want me to climb
the corporate ladder

06:36.063 --> 06:38.463
and take my series 7.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.265
- So what kind of
medication is that?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.166
- Exactly.

06:42.535 --> 06:46.505
So I came down a few days
early to finish my book.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.974
- Yeah, yeah, the
brothers from queens.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.175
- That's the one.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.147
- Well, that's blade.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.715
It's time to go, my friend.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.582
- Already?

06:57.584 --> 06:58.784
Let's down it.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.819
- Cheers.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.440
- Hey.

08:30.943 --> 08:31.843
Hey, dude.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.312
Dude, wake up.

08:39.885 --> 08:43.121
Looks like you're gonna
need some of this.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.856
You can get pretty
fried out here.

08:44.858 --> 08:45.757
- Thanks.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.762
- Rough night?

08:52.665 --> 08:55.233
- You could say that.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.468
- I'm Vanessa.

08:57.336 --> 08:58.236
- Diego.

08:59.772 --> 09:03.475
- That's okay.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.677
So, you in town visiting?

09:05.679 --> 09:08.013
I saw you yesterday
with your luggage.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.882
- Yeah, a little
summer vacation.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.783
- Sweet.

09:13.452 --> 09:14.953
Where are you from?

09:14.955 --> 09:16.555
- New York.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.524
- Oh, that explains
your pastiness.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.762
- Where are you from?

09:23.764 --> 09:26.431
- Oh, no, I live here, yeah.

09:26.433 --> 09:30.435
I actually work at the
bar here at the hotel.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.937
Just came by to
pick something up.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.838
Thought you needed
a little rescuing.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.507
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.508
Oh, keep it.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.842
I've got plenty.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.511
See ya around.

09:39.513 --> 09:40.412
- See ya.

10:41.574 --> 10:42.474
Fuck.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.565
- Hey.

11:09.802 --> 11:10.702
You again.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.238
- Hey.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.239
- Didn't your mom ever
teach you not to shop

11:14.241 --> 11:15.974
on an empty stomach?

11:17.309 --> 11:22.113
- Didn't your mom ever teach
you not to stalk people?

11:22.115 --> 11:25.216
Thanks for saving
my life earlier.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.218
- Ooh, are you sure about that?

11:27.220 --> 11:28.353
Ouch.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.254
- No.

11:30.656 --> 11:33.391
- So, I know you got enough
food to last you a lifetime,

11:33.393 --> 11:36.695
but I'm having a little
dinner party at my place

11:36.697 --> 11:38.863
if you wanna come by.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.332
- Thanks, but I got a
lot of work to get done

11:41.334 --> 11:44.402
before my wife gets
into town, so...

11:46.972 --> 11:47.939
- All right.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.808
In case you change your mind.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.209
- Alrighty then.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.446
See ya.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.281
- Dude.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.582
- Diego!

13:04.584 --> 13:06.751
- See ya.
- See ya.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.153
You made it.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.854
- Yeah.
- It's perfect timing.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.723
Everybody, this is Diego.

13:11.725 --> 13:13.625
Mauricio from college.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.096

music video days.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.104
- Diego,
nice to meet you.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.238
- Let's get you a drink.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.306
- All right.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.713
Sorry for the half bottle.

13:35.715 --> 13:36.548
- Are you kidding?

13:36.550 --> 13:37.715
It's perfect.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.419
- It's a pretty nice place.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.887
You live here by yourself?

13:42.889 --> 13:44.956
- I'm house sitting
for a friend.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.358
He's away on business, so...

13:48.961 --> 13:52.197
I didn't think you
were gonna make it.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.602
- I was
tryin' to be good.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.672
- But you can be good tomorrow.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.573
- Yeah.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.530
Where's the bathroom?

14:25.532 --> 14:29.033
- Just right
through those doors.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.839
- Hi.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.741
- Hey, tiger.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.577
Sorry, I saw that
i missed your call.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.645
- It's okay.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.381
Where are you?

15:16.383 --> 15:19.984
- Dave's friend's
having a get together.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.153
- Oh, cool.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.322
Did you get a lot of
writing done today?

15:24.324 --> 15:25.556
- Yeah, I did.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.727
- You think you'll
be done by the summer?

15:29.729 --> 15:30.962
- Yeah, maybe.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.667
- Well, I'm really proud of you.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.702
But I'll let you get
back to your party.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.103
I just wanted to say goodnight.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.371
Okay.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.506
Goodnight, chulita.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.674
- Bye, guapo.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.992
- Everything okay?

16:00.994 --> 16:03.661
- Yeah, I just had
to call the wife.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.296
- Short leash, huh?

16:07.333 --> 16:08.766
Come on, we're
gonna play a game.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.168
- What's that?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.103
- It's called sex,
drugs, and rock and roll.

16:13.974 --> 16:17.375
Okay, this time you
start off, you start off.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.510
- Autoerotic aphyxiation.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.047
- Hey!
- Oh, wow, fancy.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.148
- Fancy pants.

16:24.150 --> 16:28.953
- Okay, um, blowjobs.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.188
- I think I can say cunt.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.589
Cunt's a word at
this point, right?

16:31.591 --> 16:33.458
- Okay, sure.
- Sure.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.994
- Uh, dick.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.495
- Um, ecstasy.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.496
Obviously.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.398
- Obviously.
- Obviously.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.367
- Uh, fuck.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.042
- Guns.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.045
No!

16:54.047 --> 16:56.147
- Drink, drink, drink!
- Drink!

16:57.584 --> 16:58.483
- Um...

16:59.351 --> 17:00.251
H, uh...

17:02.254 --> 17:03.421
Nope, that's not a word.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.821
- Drink!

17:06.525 --> 17:08.693
- You were
lookin' for ho.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.729
- Ready?

17:11.731 --> 17:12.563
- Yes.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.431
- On the count of three!

17:13.433 --> 17:14.832
One, two, three!

17:52.504 --> 17:54.238
- Hey,

17:54.240 --> 17:55.073
Leave a message.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.141
- Yo, call me.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.966
- You're alive.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.100
- I survived.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.938
- Did you have fun?

19:00.940 --> 19:01.973
- Oh yeah.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.142
Are you kidding me?

19:04.144 --> 19:05.042
- Good.

19:06.712 --> 19:07.612
I'm glad.

19:10.516 --> 19:11.516
- Cute kid.

19:17.023 --> 19:20.691
- You and your wife plan on
having kids anytime soon?

19:20.693 --> 19:21.592
- Yeah.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.629
Sure.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.230
- How many?

19:26.232 --> 19:27.398
- I don't know.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.633
Three or four.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.602
- Wow, that's ambitious.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.139
- Stop staring at me.

19:40.412 --> 19:41.812
- How old are you?

19:41.814 --> 19:43.981
If you don't mind me asking.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.583
- I just turned 30.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.884
- Oh no, a Leo.

19:48.787 --> 19:51.289
- Oh no, an astrology weirdo.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.696
- I said stop staring at me.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.566
- Alexander.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.205
- Okay, um,
let's go to the beach

20:07.207 --> 20:09.941
before you get assaulted
by a five year-old.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.776
- Sounds like a plan.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.855
- You
don't mind, right?

20:24.857 --> 20:25.856
- Nope.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.125
- I just really hate tan lines.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.026
- Me, too.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.180
Nice tattoo.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.081
- Thanks.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.516
Used to say Alberto in cursive,

20:52.518 --> 20:54.752
but then when we got a
divorce I just did this.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.420
- It really is a tattoo?

20:56.422 --> 20:58.856
I thought it was, like, a
club stamp or something.

20:58.858 --> 21:02.260
- Oh no.

21:02.262 --> 21:06.664
Ooh, yeah, I was kinda going
for a minimal art thing.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.066
But sure, club stamp, works.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.970
So, how long have
you been married?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.438
- Uh, six months.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.577
But we've been together
for, like, six years.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.813
- Oh, so the honeymoon's
already over.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.053
- Not really.

21:32.658 --> 21:35.726
- She must be a pretty
cool woman if she lets you

21:35.728 --> 21:40.031
come down here all by
yourself to do writing.

21:40.033 --> 21:43.834
- Yeah, she's really
supportive of my career.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.637
I'm a pretty lucky guy.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.044
- I'm gonna go for a swim.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.945
- I'll be right there.

22:08.860 --> 22:13.030
That was the best Cuban
sandwich I've ever had.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.165
- I told you.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.602
- So, what's the deal
with mystery dude?

22:18.604 --> 22:20.171
The guy you're living with.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.306
You guys dating or what?

22:22.308 --> 22:23.574
- Tomas?

22:23.576 --> 22:26.444
No, I wouldn't call it dating.
- Tomas.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.279
What would you call it?

22:28.281 --> 22:29.714
- He's nice.

22:29.716 --> 22:30.781
We have fun.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.485
I kinda wanna end up with
somebody closer to my own age.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.319
- Why?

22:35.321 --> 22:36.554
How old is he?

22:36.556 --> 22:38.589
- I don't know,
like, 52 I think.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.490
- 52?

22:41.026 --> 22:44.028
- He just got recently
divorced as well.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.930
You know, his wife got
the house and kids,

22:45.932 --> 22:47.732
he got the beach property.

22:47.734 --> 22:48.632
- And you.

22:49.735 --> 22:50.634
- Sure.

22:52.037 --> 22:55.840
But whatever, he's always out
of town anyway for work, so.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.742
- You get the place to yourself.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.076
- Yeah.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.011
- That's a pretty sweet deal.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.079
- I like it.

23:03.849 --> 23:07.718
- So, how long you
been workin' here?

23:07.720 --> 23:10.488
- Not long, like, a year.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.022
I used to dance.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.424
- Oh.

23:13.426 --> 23:17.595
- Not like that.

23:17.597 --> 23:21.031
No, like, music videos
for local artists.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.000
I got to do a cruise.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.001
It was fun.

23:25.370 --> 23:28.439
But with my knees, you know,
getting old, so I had to stop.

23:28.441 --> 23:32.343
But whatever, I'm making
my own jewelry now.

23:32.345 --> 23:33.277
- You made these?

23:33.279 --> 23:34.378
- Yeah.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.446
- It's cool.

23:37.082 --> 23:37.982
- Thanks.

23:39.985 --> 23:41.619
What time is it?

23:41.621 --> 23:45.389
I should probably
get ready for work.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.091
Do you wanna stop by later?

23:47.093 --> 23:48.259
Have a drink?

23:49.394 --> 23:50.628
- Sure.
- Cool.

23:53.665 --> 23:55.866
You can finish my
sandwich if you want.

23:55.868 --> 23:56.767
- I will.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.670
I'm not changing the plans.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.905
I met a girl who
works at the bar

24:00.907 --> 24:02.440
who asked me to come
by for one drink.

24:02.442 --> 24:03.407
Can we do one drink?

24:03.409 --> 24:04.375
- Okay, one drink.

24:04.377 --> 24:05.176
That's it.
- Thank you.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.544
That's all I ask.

24:10.148 --> 24:13.250
- I think I've worked
enough with some of

24:13.252 --> 24:15.252
the biggest directors
and I'm still not

24:15.254 --> 24:17.121
a household name, so...

24:18.458 --> 24:20.424
I'm a little
frustrated about that.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.927
So say goodnight
to the park guy.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.331
That's the last time
you gonna see a park guy

24:27.333 --> 24:29.266
like this, let me tell ya.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.201
- Do more.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.669
More, more, more, more.

24:31.671 --> 24:35.906
- Let me tell you something!

24:38.043 --> 24:39.109
- All right.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.110
That's it.

24:49.354 --> 24:50.955
- Hey, it's Diego.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.923
Please leave a message.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.903
- Did you reach him yet?

25:05.905 --> 25:08.806
- No, he's probably
out with Dave.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.109
- So, anyway...

25:12.111 --> 25:13.344
- So, do you wanna

25:13.346 --> 25:15.813
go check out some
really cool artwork?

25:15.815 --> 25:17.381
- I would love to.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.122
- It's caused a
lot of headaches,

25:25.124 --> 25:26.857
but I wouldn't change a thing.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.260
Buying a house was the
best decision we ever made.

25:29.262 --> 25:31.695
- No, I'm really
happy for you guys.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.964
Hey, one second,
I'll be right back.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.032
- All right.

25:37.636 --> 25:39.870
- Hey, mister anti-social.

25:40.939 --> 25:43.107
What are you doin'?

25:43.109 --> 25:45.676
- Just gettin' some fresh air.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.948
- Why don't you let me take
you around the city tomorrow?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.850
Could show you around.

25:54.419 --> 25:58.656
There's a lot more to Miami
than just south beach.

26:00.158 --> 26:02.259
- I don't play bingo.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.463
- Seriously, come on.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.198
Aren't you a writer?

26:09.467 --> 26:12.202
Where's your sense of adventure?

26:15.507 --> 26:19.076
Do I need to ask your
wife for permission?

26:20.879 --> 26:21.779
- No.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.015
Let's go.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.684
Where are we goin'?

26:26.686 --> 26:29.353
- It's a surprise.

26:29.355 --> 26:33.123
But I promise I'll
show you a great time.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.024
- Okay.

26:48.873 --> 26:50.174
- Hey, tiger.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.008
- Hi.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.176
Did I wake you?

26:52.178 --> 26:55.012
- No, I was just getting
some writing done.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.080
- Oh, good.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.047
How was last night?

26:57.049 --> 26:58.349
I tried calling you.

26:58.351 --> 26:59.917
- I called you back.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.151
I left you a message,
you didn't get it?

27:01.153 --> 27:02.086
- Yeah, sorry.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.454
Actually we were at Vaughan,

27:03.456 --> 27:05.823
but I don't have
reception in the basement.

27:05.825 --> 27:06.757
- Oh, that's all right.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.025
Did you have a good time?

27:08.027 --> 27:10.561
- Yeah, but I'm bored now.

27:10.563 --> 27:14.365
So, listen, I was thinking
to change my flight.

27:14.367 --> 27:15.232
- Oh yeah?

27:15.234 --> 27:16.200
- Yeah.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.401
The office is so dead right now.

27:17.403 --> 27:20.037
Kelly's in Paris,
Olivia's on maternity,

27:20.039 --> 27:22.373
and everyone else
is in the Hamptons.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.208
- Sounds like a great idea.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.244
- Yeah, so I'm thinking
i might come tomorrow.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.212
You don't mind, do you?

27:28.214 --> 27:29.713
- No, of course not.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.416
I miss having you asleep
by my side while I write.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.085
- Okay, I promise I won't
disturb you during the day.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.553
I'll hang out with Carol.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.522
- It's okay, really.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.624
- Okay great, then
I'll change my ticket.

27:40.626 --> 27:42.059
Yay! I'm so excited!

27:42.061 --> 27:43.594
- Me, too.

27:43.596 --> 27:45.362
- Okay, I'll
talk to you later, bear.

27:45.364 --> 27:46.430
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:58.243 --> 27:59.476
- Hey.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.679
- Hey, are we
still on for tonight?

28:01.681 --> 28:04.148
- I was actually
just gonna call you.

28:04.150 --> 28:07.985
- Uh-oh, you better
not be canceling on me.

28:07.987 --> 28:11.155
- I appreciate the
invite, but, uh...

28:13.858 --> 28:15.759
Mariana's coming
into town tomorrow

28:15.761 --> 28:18.429
and I have a lot of work to do.

28:19.664 --> 28:22.533
- Are you seriously
gonna blow me off?

28:22.535 --> 28:25.769
I got my shift covered
and everything.

28:28.273 --> 28:29.106
- I don't--

28:29.108 --> 28:30.007
- just...

28:30.842 --> 28:32.843
Come out for one drink.

28:35.780 --> 28:36.847
- One drink.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.451
One drink? I can do one drink.

28:40.453 --> 28:42.319
- Okay, cool.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.555
I'll pick you up at nine.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.457
- I'll see ya at nine.

28:56.469 --> 28:59.103
- So,
where are we going?

28:59.105 --> 29:01.004
- Just relax.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.066
It's right over here.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.001
Hi.
- Vanessa.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.402
- How you doin'?

29:32.404 --> 29:34.972
- Two Tequila shots.

29:36.474 --> 29:37.374
Hi!
- Hi!

29:42.113 --> 29:43.013
- Cheers.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.621
You'll see, it's
gonna be awesome.

29:50.623 --> 29:51.455
I'm sorry.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.423
- Shh.
- Shh.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.524
- You have to shh.

30:27.526 --> 30:28.792
There's people living here.

30:28.794 --> 30:33.030
- We've got
neighbors.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.000
- Oh, it's so nice in here.

30:46.811 --> 30:49.179
- Do you mind?

30:49.181 --> 30:50.314
- Not at all.

31:04.295 --> 31:05.195
Mm.

31:10.134 --> 31:11.368
- Much better.

31:31.823 --> 31:32.789
I'm so sad.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.326
- Why are you sad?

31:36.328 --> 31:39.396
- I've been having so much fun
with you the past few days.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.198
Don't want it to end.

31:44.769 --> 31:49.006
- Why
does it have to end.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.777
Because Mariana's coming?

31:55.580 --> 31:57.481
We could all hang out.

32:05.623 --> 32:08.458
- I'm just really
glad I met you.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.829
- I'm really glad
i met you, too.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.857
I can't do this.

32:42.627 --> 32:43.860
- You want to?

32:45.296 --> 32:46.530
- Hmm.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.066
Of course I want to.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.702
- So...

33:03.481 --> 33:05.048
- Hold on.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.493
No.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.429
- Maybe you should go.

35:00.598 --> 35:04.134
- Hey.

35:05.203 --> 35:08.138
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.040
Thank you.

35:11.676 --> 35:12.976
- How was the flight?

35:12.978 --> 35:14.478
- Good.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.549
- I'm happy you're here.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.717
- Me, too.

35:20.719 --> 35:21.618
Aye!

35:31.462 --> 35:32.696
So pretty.

35:32.698 --> 35:33.997
- Right?
- Yeah.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.200
- Come here.

35:37.202 --> 35:40.070
Say hello to my little friend.

35:40.072 --> 35:40.971
- Huh?

35:43.908 --> 35:46.209
I ordered a king bed.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.211
- It's okay.

35:48.213 --> 35:49.112
- Yeah.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.284
Ah, look at the view.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.819
We should go for a walk.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.721
- It's a little hot for that.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.089
- Later.

35:59.091 --> 36:00.924
Like, for dinner maybe?

36:00.926 --> 36:02.259
- Okay.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.073
- Hey, you know
what I was thinking?

36:18.544 --> 36:21.211
Maybe we could start, you know,

36:22.313 --> 36:24.548
doing it without anything.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.554
- Yeah?

36:33.991 --> 36:35.458
You sure?
- Yeah.

36:37.228 --> 36:39.462
What do you think?

36:39.464 --> 36:40.697
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:07.024 --> 37:09.826
- I think
I'm just tired.

37:11.862 --> 37:13.430
- It's okay, baby.

37:19.370 --> 37:22.606
We have plenty of
time for that later.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.344
I'm gonna get my
bathing suit on, okay?

37:27.346 --> 37:28.645
- Okay.

37:42.393 --> 37:45.362
- Hey, we
should invite some
friends over tonight.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.930
I wanna see Carol.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.335
- Okay.

37:57.074 --> 37:58.608
All set.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.676
- Thank you.

38:03.214 --> 38:04.881
This is so amazing.

38:08.252 --> 38:11.154
Couldn't you just see
us here in a big house

38:11.156 --> 38:15.392
with kids running around in
the backyard, playing tennis?

38:17.428 --> 38:18.928
Hm?

38:18.930 --> 38:21.264
- I like the tennis part.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.733
What kind of skirt
would you wear?

38:23.735 --> 38:25.602
- I'm serious.

38:25.604 --> 38:26.670
- I am, too.

38:30.074 --> 38:31.308
Ow!

38:31.310 --> 38:32.208
Tiger.

38:33.577 --> 38:34.477
Bad girl.

38:50.528 --> 38:54.764
I think I'm gonna quit my job
when we go back to New York.

38:57.301 --> 39:01.538
- Baby, we've had
this conversation,
like, a million times.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.240
You don't like anything
else besides writing

39:04.242 --> 39:06.910
and, I mean, this
job finally gives you

39:06.912 --> 39:11.147
that opportunity of writing
in your spare time, so...

39:12.616 --> 39:13.817
What are you gonna do?

39:13.819 --> 39:15.885
Go back and wait tables?

39:17.388 --> 39:18.254
- No.

39:19.123 --> 39:20.757
Guess you're right.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.795
- Hey, you wanna
go in the water?

39:25.797 --> 39:26.696
Yeah?

39:28.532 --> 39:29.432
Let's go.

39:35.272 --> 39:36.172
Oh!

39:36.174 --> 39:37.073
Oh my god!

39:42.012 --> 39:43.279
Let's get mojitos!

39:43.281 --> 39:44.781
- I thought we were
gonna go to dinner.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.383
- I know, but it's
still early, so we can--

39:46.385 --> 39:48.218
- we'll get a drink
at the restaurant.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.520
- But then it's not
gonna be happy hour.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.789
Just one, I just got here.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.125
Hi.

39:56.794 --> 39:59.062
Can I have a mojito, please?

39:59.064 --> 40:00.530
What do you want?

40:01.832 --> 40:03.333
- Mojito is fine.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.237
- Great, two mojitos.

40:08.305 --> 40:09.806
- Oh, so I forgot to tell you,

40:09.808 --> 40:11.741
I actually spoke
to my mom yesterday

40:11.743 --> 40:13.543
and she was telling me
that everyone decided

40:13.545 --> 40:16.146
to go to Mexico City for
Christmas and new year's,

40:16.148 --> 40:19.249
so I was thinking why stay
in New York by yourselves?

40:19.251 --> 40:21.050
You know, I think
it's gonna be boring,

40:21.052 --> 40:22.485
so I bought us tickets.

40:22.487 --> 40:24.554
I actually talked to Alejandra
so she's gonna be there

40:24.556 --> 40:27.657
and she's back with
Manuel and

40:27.659 --> 40:30.427
I know I shouldn't be upset,
but I don't understand

40:30.429 --> 40:32.595
why she's with someone that
treats her like shit, you know?

40:32.597 --> 40:34.631
And I was just
trying to talk to her

40:34.633 --> 40:37.066
and I feel like such a
mom and I'm just like,

40:37.068 --> 40:38.568
I don't know, anyway, whatever.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.402
We shouldn't be
thinking about that.

40:39.404 --> 40:41.004
We're on vacation.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.372
I don't know, I just
thought it would be fun.

40:42.374 --> 40:43.673
Everyone's gonna be there.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.208
Oh, thank you.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.576
Oh my god, I love your necklace.

40:46.578 --> 40:47.410
- Oh, thanks.

40:47.412 --> 40:48.511
I actually made it.

40:48.513 --> 40:49.546
- No way.

40:49.548 --> 40:50.647
It's so pretty.

40:50.649 --> 40:51.915
- Thanks.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.583
Actually I'm starting
my own jewelry line.

40:53.585 --> 40:54.551
- Oh,
what's your name?

40:54.553 --> 40:55.452
- I'm Vanessa.

40:55.454 --> 40:56.419
- I'm Mariana.

40:56.421 --> 40:57.821
This is my husband, Diego.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.122
I'm actually a fashion publicist

40:59.124 --> 41:01.090
and we represent a lot
of fashion designers

41:01.092 --> 41:02.759
and jewelry designers.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.294
- Oh, that's really interesting.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.830
- Do you
have a website, or...

41:06.832 --> 41:08.531
- No, not yet, but
i could mail you

41:08.533 --> 41:10.733
some samples if you'd like.

41:10.735 --> 41:13.403
- Well, actually we're
having people over tonight,

41:13.405 --> 41:15.138
like, around 10, at our suite.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.539
Is it 265?

41:16.541 --> 41:20.310
Yeah, so suite 265, so
if you wanna come by.

41:20.312 --> 41:22.445
- You know, I'd love
to, but I actually

41:22.447 --> 41:24.914
already have plans tonight.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.683
- Let me just give
you my business card

41:26.685 --> 41:28.685
and then you can get
my email off of that.

41:28.687 --> 41:30.687
Thanks.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.822
Nice meeting you.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.725
- So, I was thinking we
could either go somewhere

41:35.727 --> 41:40.230
in Mexico or we can just stay
in Mexico City and relax--

41:50.174 --> 41:53.576
- Why the hell did you
invite the bartender?

41:53.578 --> 41:55.278
- What's the big deal?

41:55.280 --> 41:56.579
I just wanted to
see some jewelry.

42:14.698 --> 42:18.201
Hey, check my bag, i
brought you a shirt.

42:20.004 --> 42:22.472
Why are your jeans rolled up?

42:23.607 --> 42:24.908
- I don't know.

42:35.252 --> 42:36.686
- So lucky.

42:36.688 --> 42:37.587
Seriously, having a
small wedding is probably

42:37.589 --> 42:38.721
the best thing ever.

42:38.723 --> 42:39.923
- I hope so.

42:39.925 --> 42:40.790
- Yeah, we actually
wanted a small wedding--

42:40.792 --> 42:41.991
- really?

42:41.993 --> 42:44.460
- My mom and my dad
would've been, like, no.

42:44.462 --> 42:45.695
- I know, but your
wedding was beautiful.

42:45.697 --> 42:47.130
- No, I'm not saying
i didn't like it,

42:47.132 --> 42:48.798
I'm just saying something
intimate and private

42:48.800 --> 42:49.866
like yours is perfect.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.534
- Don't forget my drink.

42:51.536 --> 42:53.202
- I don't know, whatever.
Enough of this wedding talk.

42:53.204 --> 42:55.171
- I'm sure it's
gonna be perfect.
How are you?

42:55.173 --> 42:56.339
- Good!

42:56.341 --> 42:58.374
It's been forever.
- I know!

43:16.226 --> 43:18.361
So ready to get fucked
up at my own wedding.

43:18.363 --> 43:19.295
- You're so...

43:19.297 --> 43:20.129
Oh my god!

43:20.131 --> 43:21.397
- Mariana!

43:21.399 --> 43:22.799
- How are you?

43:22.801 --> 43:24.167
So good to see you.

43:24.169 --> 43:25.101
Look at this jacket.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.035
- It's so nice to see you.

43:26.037 --> 43:27.003
You look amazing as always.

43:27.005 --> 43:28.071
- Hey, what's up, dude?

43:28.073 --> 43:29.339
You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

43:29.341 --> 43:30.206
- I love that new
haircut, by the--

43:30.208 --> 43:31.107
- hey, sexy people!

43:31.109 --> 43:32.775
- Ahh!
- Ha ha ha!

43:32.777 --> 43:34.377
How are you?

43:35.914 --> 43:36.946
- Oh my god!

43:36.948 --> 43:38.615
I got your email...

43:39.650 --> 43:41.317
- Nice shirt, dude.

43:43.354 --> 43:45.488
- So, you all right, man?

43:45.490 --> 43:46.522
- No.

43:46.524 --> 43:48.191
It's that girl Vanessa.

43:48.193 --> 43:50.393
- What, she say
something about me?

43:50.395 --> 43:51.461
- Not quite.

43:52.563 --> 43:54.998
We hung out last night
and we almost hooked up.

43:55.000 --> 43:55.832
- Really?

43:55.834 --> 43:57.767
- Nothing happened.

43:57.769 --> 43:59.469
Well, we kissed.

43:59.471 --> 44:00.269
- Whoa!

44:00.271 --> 44:02.038
- But that's it, okay.

44:02.040 --> 44:05.008
But Mariana met her at the bar
tonight and invited her over.

44:05.010 --> 44:08.544
Mariana doesn't know
that we've already met.

44:08.546 --> 44:11.047
And if she did she'd
fucking kill me.

44:11.049 --> 44:13.049
I'm scared Vanessa
will say something.

44:13.051 --> 44:15.284
She's been acting jealous.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.756
- So you think she's
a bunny boiler?

44:19.758 --> 44:21.057
- A what?

44:21.059 --> 44:23.326
- You know, like in
fatal attraction?

44:23.328 --> 44:25.695
Glenn close's character
boils the kid's bunny

44:25.697 --> 44:28.731
to get revenge on
Michael Douglas?

44:28.733 --> 44:30.233
- Not helping.

44:30.235 --> 44:33.770
Look, could you just keep an
eye on Vanessa tonight for me?

44:33.772 --> 44:37.840
Okay, I don't trust her,
especially around Mariana.

44:37.842 --> 44:40.777
- Speak of the devil.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.578
- Thanks for coming.

44:42.580 --> 44:43.546
You look so cute.

44:43.548 --> 44:44.614
Are these it?

44:44.616 --> 44:47.250
- Don't worry, I got this, man.

44:47.252 --> 44:48.151
- Fuck.

44:51.655 --> 44:53.089
- Just a few pieces.

44:53.091 --> 44:54.891
- Awesome, i
can't wait to look at them.

44:54.893 --> 44:56.492
Can I get you a drink?

44:56.494 --> 44:57.660
- Um...

44:57.662 --> 44:59.462
- Let me get that drink
for you, actually.

44:59.464 --> 45:01.631
I'm Dave, I don't
believe we've met.

45:01.633 --> 45:02.932
- Vanessa.

45:02.934 --> 45:03.800
- Pleasure to meet you.

45:03.802 --> 45:04.834
I've got this.

45:04.836 --> 45:06.836
- We'll catch up later.

45:24.722 --> 45:27.323
- Little surprised
to see you here.

45:27.325 --> 45:29.258
- Please, get over yourself.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.327
I came to see your wife.

45:34.531 --> 45:36.499
You know, I looked her up.

45:36.501 --> 45:40.903
How come you never mentioned
she works in fashion?

45:40.905 --> 45:42.238
- I don't know.

45:43.173 --> 45:45.074
It never occurred to me.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.476
- In case you're wondering,

45:46.478 --> 45:47.710
I'm not gonna say
anything about last night

45:47.712 --> 45:50.480
so you don't need
Dave to babysit me.

46:19.243 --> 46:20.143
- Whoo!

46:27.951 --> 46:30.520
All right, where are we going?

46:34.057 --> 46:35.992
- We could go to
electric pickle?

46:35.994 --> 46:37.660
- Yeah, the pickle!

46:40.932 --> 46:42.031
Come on, let's do this.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.065
- You wanna go?

46:43.067 --> 46:44.700
- Not really.

46:44.702 --> 46:46.068
- Rumba!

46:46.070 --> 46:47.570
- Let's go!

46:47.572 --> 46:48.471
- Please?

46:50.207 --> 46:51.474
Hm?

46:51.476 --> 46:53.409
Just one.
- Okay.

46:53.411 --> 46:54.377
- Let's go!

47:17.067 --> 47:17.967
- Hi.

47:19.369 --> 47:20.269
- Hey.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.239
Where's Dave?

47:23.241 --> 47:25.541
- Getting me another drink.

47:28.979 --> 47:31.447
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.

47:32.749 --> 47:34.483
I didn't mean to get upset,

47:34.485 --> 47:37.787
I'm just going through
a lot right now.

47:37.789 --> 47:38.855
- It's okay.

47:41.558 --> 47:44.026
- I really admire you, Diego.

47:47.197 --> 47:51.667
- What you think of me,
it's important, you know?

47:51.669 --> 47:55.938
I don't want things to
be weird between us.

47:55.940 --> 47:57.707
- They're not weird.

48:07.651 --> 48:10.219
- Hey, what's going
on over there?

48:10.221 --> 48:11.487
- What?

48:11.489 --> 48:13.890
- Girl, are you seeing this?

48:17.895 --> 48:21.964
- Oh, hell no.
- Girl, go handle your shit.

48:21.966 --> 48:23.900
- I'll be right back.

48:23.902 --> 48:26.535
Can I have another one?

48:26.537 --> 48:27.470
Same.

48:27.472 --> 48:29.538
Can you make it a double?

48:41.385 --> 48:43.219
- Where's Mariana?

48:43.221 --> 48:45.354
- I think she went
to go find you.

48:45.356 --> 48:47.089
- She went to the bar.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.325
She's over there, I think.

48:54.765 --> 48:57.867
- I've been
looking all over for you.

48:57.869 --> 48:59.101
- Yeah, right.

49:00.370 --> 49:02.338
- What's wrong?

49:03.807 --> 49:05.942
- You just left me there.

49:05.944 --> 49:09.045
I could've left and you
wouldn't even notice.

49:09.047 --> 49:10.179
- You're drunk.

49:10.181 --> 49:12.515
Let's go back to the hotel.

49:14.918 --> 49:15.818
Mariana.

49:18.555 --> 49:20.656
- Hey, Diego, let me handle it.

49:20.658 --> 49:21.490
I got it.

49:21.492 --> 49:23.225
- All right.

49:32.302 --> 49:34.637
- Hey, hey girl, it's okay.

49:41.111 --> 49:42.712
You okay?

49:42.714 --> 49:43.612
- Fine.

49:50.153 --> 49:52.455
- Why won't you talk to me?

49:58.061 --> 49:58.961
Mariana.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.400
I'm not a mind reader.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.509
I'm sorry I yelled.

50:14.745 --> 50:16.312
Will you come out?

50:19.716 --> 50:21.717
Do you want some water?

50:23.687 --> 50:24.954
- No, I'm fine.

50:24.956 --> 50:27.757
I'm gonna come out
in a few minutes.

50:49.746 --> 50:51.580
- I got you some water.

50:51.582 --> 50:54.383
- I just
need to sleep.

51:10.333 --> 51:12.334
- Good morning.

51:17.141 --> 51:18.207
- Oh my god.

51:22.079 --> 51:22.078
My head.

51:24.414 --> 51:27.716
- I'm gonna go get
us something to eat.

52:51.501 --> 52:52.501
- gracias.
- Gracias.

54:46.049 --> 54:47.516
- Hey.

54:47.518 --> 54:48.517
- Hey.

54:48.519 --> 54:51.353
- How's she feeling?

54:51.355 --> 54:53.322
- She's still sleeping.

54:57.227 --> 55:01.230
- So, you probably won't
see me again before you go.

55:01.232 --> 55:05.467
I'm gonna head up to
Tallahassee and see my brother.

55:20.950 --> 55:23.018
- Thanks for everything.

55:28.892 --> 55:29.792
Take care.

55:37.935 --> 55:38.834
Tiger.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.738
I got you.

55:42.740 --> 55:44.907
- Thanks.

55:44.909 --> 55:47.276
- You feeling better?

55:47.278 --> 55:48.744
- Yeah.

55:58.221 --> 56:01.023
- You're organizing your bags?

56:01.025 --> 56:01.924
- Mm-hm.

56:09.132 --> 56:13.302
Is there anything that
you need to tell me?

56:13.304 --> 56:14.870
- What's goin' on?

56:16.239 --> 56:19.108
- Was yesterday the first time
you met Vanessa at the bar?

56:19.110 --> 56:20.008
- Yes.

56:21.444 --> 56:25.180
- So why is she repeatedly
on your call log?

56:26.516 --> 56:29.284
- You're mad at me because
of some stupid texts?

56:29.286 --> 56:30.619
- Stupid texts?

56:31.921 --> 56:33.422
- Nothing happened, if
that's what you're thinking.

56:33.424 --> 56:34.723
- So if nothing happened,
why would you pretend

56:34.725 --> 56:35.724
you didn't know her?

56:35.726 --> 56:37.126
- Because I know how you are.

56:37.128 --> 56:39.695
- What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Diego?

56:39.697 --> 56:43.966
- Mariana, please, I just need
a clean, well-lighted place.

56:43.968 --> 56:45.534
- What?

56:45.536 --> 56:48.070
- It's Hemingway, forget it.

56:48.072 --> 56:49.505
- Okay, you know what, Diego?

56:49.507 --> 56:53.275
Just let me if you're
ever ready to be honest.

56:53.277 --> 56:54.843
I'm gonna be at Carol's.

56:54.845 --> 56:56.311
- You're leaving?

56:57.247 --> 56:58.147
Mariana.

57:01.451 --> 57:02.885
Mariana.

57:02.887 --> 57:03.786
Mariana!

57:18.301 --> 57:19.635
- Hey, Mariana!

57:36.453 --> 57:38.587
- Do you have everything?

57:38.589 --> 57:40.088
- This is perfect.

57:40.090 --> 57:41.523
- Good.

57:41.525 --> 57:42.658
I'm in shock.

57:43.893 --> 57:46.829
I didn't think he had it in him.

57:46.831 --> 57:50.699
I really thought that
you had him on lock down.

57:50.701 --> 57:52.434
Like, in a good way.

57:57.507 --> 57:58.407
Men.

57:59.642 --> 58:00.742
- I'm so tired.

58:00.744 --> 58:02.644
- It'll be okay.

58:02.646 --> 58:03.712
- Thank you.

58:05.248 --> 58:07.683
I'm sorry for doing this

58:07.685 --> 58:09.251
right before your wedding.
- No!

58:09.253 --> 58:10.586
I'm glad you called me.

58:10.588 --> 58:12.187
That's what friends are for.

58:15.992 --> 58:19.995
- Don't be so hard
on yourself, Diego.

58:19.997 --> 58:20.896
I mean...

58:24.067 --> 58:26.001
Married life's made
you a little sloppy,

58:26.003 --> 58:27.336
okay, you know, you forgot.

58:27.338 --> 58:29.404
You forgot what you had to do.

58:29.406 --> 58:31.273
You never thought she'd
look through your phone,

58:31.275 --> 58:34.476
but look, you know, it happens.

58:34.478 --> 58:37.112
I mean, it's not uncommon
within the first year

58:37.114 --> 58:40.015
of marriage for newlywed couples

58:40.017 --> 58:42.351
to experience this
kind of stuff.

58:42.353 --> 58:44.286
And you know how girls are.

58:44.288 --> 58:47.322
They get a little wacky
over the first few days,

58:47.324 --> 58:48.957
but then that's when
it's your green light

58:48.959 --> 58:51.226
to go in and patch things up.

58:51.228 --> 58:52.394
- And besides, you know,

58:52.396 --> 58:54.997
Mariana's gonna
understand one thing.

58:54.999 --> 58:57.733
You're having trouble
adjusting, you know.

58:57.735 --> 58:59.201
Corporate ladder.

59:00.336 --> 59:02.037
And I think that was
just the real Diego

59:02.039 --> 59:06.241
that we know that was
itching to come out.

59:06.243 --> 59:08.410
- And what? What do I do?

59:09.412 --> 59:12.581
She won't fuckin' talk to me.

59:12.583 --> 59:14.182
- It's normal.

59:14.184 --> 59:16.418
The first few days are
gonna be like that.

59:16.420 --> 59:19.488
And then you'll see that
there's a golden window

59:19.490 --> 59:22.257
that's gonna open and
that's when you come in.

59:22.259 --> 59:25.627
You go on the Internet,
you get a letter,

59:25.629 --> 59:27.729
one of those apology, you
know, boyfriend to girlfriend.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.531
You modify it a little bit,

59:29.533 --> 59:31.066
'cause you never know,
one of her friends

59:31.068 --> 59:33.268
could be like, "oh that's
a letter from," you know.

59:33.270 --> 59:34.603
You don't want that.

59:34.605 --> 59:36.171
So change it up a little bit.

59:36.173 --> 59:37.539
Get her a nice little something,

59:37.541 --> 59:38.807
do something special for her.

59:38.809 --> 59:41.410
You know, don't go get
her an expensive thing

59:41.412 --> 59:44.046
'cause you're never
gonna pick the right one,

59:44.048 --> 59:45.781
but do something nice.

59:45.783 --> 59:49.117
A bed of roses, you
know, a little champagne.

59:49.119 --> 59:50.118
The letter.

59:52.155 --> 59:55.657
Let's just cheers to
an honest lifestyle.

59:56.526 --> 59:57.526
- Thanks, bro.

59:59.029 --> 59:59.995
- Hi.

59:59.997 --> 01:00:01.063
Thank you.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:02.297
I got flowers.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.068
You got flowers.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.536
Mariana, it says.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.473
Wonder who that's from.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:13.609
- Yeah.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.050
- What'd it say?

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:26.088
Please come back, I love you.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.490
Are you gonna call him?

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:29.091
- No.

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:33.462
No, I can't.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:14.670
Hey.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.339
- Hey.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:20.642
I sent you something,
did you get it?

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:22.110
- Yes, thank you.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.414
- You're welcome.

01:01:25.416 --> 01:01:28.784
I asked for orchids,
did they send orchids?

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:30.686
- Diego, I can't talk right now.

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:32.821
- Okay, I'm not gonna keep you.

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:35.857
I just wanna say that I miss you

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:39.428
and I really wish we
could talk in person.

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:50.138
- Are you ready to
be straight with me?

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.039
- Yes.

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:54.743
- Okay then, just meet
me at Carol's here

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:56.845
tomorrow at noon.

01:01:56.847 --> 01:01:57.746
- Okay.

01:01:58.614 --> 01:01:59.614
I love you.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.484
- I'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:03.685
Bye.

01:02:03.687 --> 01:02:06.488
- Bye.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.860
- Hey.

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:47.696
- Nice makeup.

01:02:47.698 --> 01:02:50.866
- It was my bachelorette
party last night, smart ass.

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:51.900
Come in.

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:52.968
- Thank you.

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:56.872
Hey.

01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:57.773
- Hey.

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.843
- Brought you something.

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:04.012
- Thanks.

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:12.087
- I'll be in my room if
you need anything, okay?

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:16.324
- You wanna go outside?

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:17.225
- Okay.

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:40.916
- This is hard.

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:50.325
It started the day
after I arrived.

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:54.529
I met Vanessa by the pool.

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:58.700
It was pretty innocent.

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:01.703
She woke me and
offered me sunblock,

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.907
but then I ran into her again

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.648
and it was just friendly.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.522
Then the night
before you arrived

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:23.358
she took me out,
showed me Miami,

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:30.065
and we both had a little
too much to drink.

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:35.737
We went back to
her place and we...

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.108
We kissed.

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:45.847
She kissed me, to be exact.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.419
But I didn't pull
away immediately.

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:57.559
Mariana, I know this
was wrong, but...

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:01.129
I didn't sleep with her.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.834
I'm not gonna lie.

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:12.107
I considered it.

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:17.045
But then I thought about us

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:18.780
and how I didn't wanna
throw all that away

01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:22.117
just for some girl
giving me attention.

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:29.524
Mariana, I know I acted badly

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:34.496
and I'm not proud of this.

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:43.138
And I'm not asking
you to understand,

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.676
but I'm asking you to
at least believe me.

01:05:47.678 --> 01:05:49.744
I didn't sleep with her.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:04.859
- I've been thinking about
us a lot the past few days

01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:08.964
and how I just
haven't been happy

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:13.201
for the past six months
ever since we got married.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:19.240
It's clear now that you
haven't been either.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:20.075
- That's not true.

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:21.476
- Let me finish.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:27.248
It's just lately
it just feels like

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.251
your mind is always
somewhere else.

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.556
Why can't you just be happy?

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.192
- It's called stress.

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:43.965
Sometimes I feel
like I'm on some sort

01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:46.768
of check list of
yours, you know?

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.406
Engaged, check.

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:52.741
Married, check.

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:56.211
Find Diego a new job, check.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.313
And now a baby?

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:02.317
It's like you're trying
to prove something

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:06.488
instead of just doing
things because you want to.

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:10.191
I'm sorry, but
I'm not like that.

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:12.861
- You were the one that said

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:13.795
you were tired of
waiting tables.

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.497
I was just trying to help you.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.232
- I know, tiger,
and I would've never

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:21.770
gotten the job without you,
but sometimes I feel like

01:07:21.772 --> 01:07:24.105
you don't have faith that I'll

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:25.273
be able to take care of us.

01:07:25.275 --> 01:07:26.574
- That's not true.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.676
- Well, I don't wanna
argue with you about it,

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:30.578
but that's how I feel.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.851
- Did you wanna get married?

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:39.120
- Yes, of course I did.

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:43.291
- But if I hadn't pushed you
we would just still be dating.

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:45.860
- Look, I wanted to marry you.

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:48.063
I love you.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.933
- What about kids?

01:07:51.935 --> 01:07:54.235
- I want kids, but not yet.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.173
Why can't we wait a year?

01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.074
Or two.

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:02.210
We're still young.

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:05.747
- And this has nothing
to do with Vanessa?

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:06.848
- No!

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:07.749
Nothing.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:13.621
It's a stupid night that
i regret very, very much.

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:14.856
It was just...

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:20.194
Morbid curiosity and I never
shoulda hung out with her.

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.765
- Do you wanna be with me?

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.035
Because you know we're
both adults, Diego,

01:08:27.037 --> 01:08:29.904
and nobody is forcing
us to do anything.

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:31.439
- Yes.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:32.340
Forever.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:36.810
And I want us to
have a family, too,

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:39.881
but when it's
truly right for us,

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:41.649
not because you're
trying to prove something

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:43.218
to your coworkers.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:47.287
Or because your
parents are asking.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.094
Can I hold you?

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:55.029
- No.

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:58.099
I just need time.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:01.703
- Mariana.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.339
I love you.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.478
- I love you, too, okay,

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.781
but I'm just really
confused right now.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:41.042
- Sure you don't wanna
come back to the hotel?

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:41.943
- No.

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:45.546
I'll see you at the wedding.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:47.582
- Okay.

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:29.691
- Family and friends, on
behalf of Mike and Carol,

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.727
I'd like to welcome
you all here today

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.129
on this beautiful beach.

01:10:35.131 --> 01:10:36.698
We stand together
beside the ocean

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.600
not only to witness
their commitment

01:11:09.032 --> 01:11:13.301
- I now pronounce you to
be co-captains in life,

01:11:13.303 --> 01:11:16.337
best friends forever, and
most important of all,

01:11:16.339 --> 01:11:18.039
husband and wife.

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:20.608
Mike, you may now
kiss the bride.

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.215
- Hey.

01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:02.116
- Hey.

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.253
- The
reception's started.

01:12:05.255 --> 01:12:06.321
- It's okay.

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:17.498
I'm sorry.

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:22.804
For letting things
get so out of control.

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:29.043
And you're right, I've been
putting a lot of pressure on us.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:34.982
But I've been thinking
and I wanna support you.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:41.422
Whether it's in quitting
that stupid job or whatever,

01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:44.659
and it sucks but
you'll figure it out.

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:47.962
- Really?

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:49.964
- Yeah.

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:55.069
But you gotta be
more open with me.

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:57.271
No more secrets, Diego.

01:12:57.273 --> 01:12:59.374
No more texting girls,
no more lying, okay?

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:01.142
Just complete openness.

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:02.043
- Okay.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.349
- Can I have a cigarette?

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:10.952
- You don't smoke.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.387
- Well
maybe I wanna start.

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:13.287
- Shut up.

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:23.498
I'm sorry.

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:26.734
I love you.

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:32.707
- I love you, too.

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:43.077
- You got everything?
- Yeah.
