I'm an idiot.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.250
So I asked her.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.375
- You should've come to me.
- No, you should've come to me!

14:04.583 --> 14:05.959
What are you trying to do?

14:06.041 --> 14:07.959
- You trying to sleep with her?
- No!

14:08.041 --> 14:11.625
- Trying to steal her away?
- It was a mistake,
the whole thing.

14:11.709 --> 14:14.083
Those feelings are gone.
I don't have them.

14:14.166 --> 14:18.333
I came back because
I wanna make things right.

14:18.417 --> 14:20.917
You asked me
to be your best man and I'm...

14:21.000 --> 14:22.625
Dave's my best man.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.041
You can't just come back

14:26.125 --> 14:28.166
and pick up where
you left off, Brian.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.792
It doesn't work that way.

14:30.875 --> 14:34.542
- You sent me
the wedding invitation.
- Yeah, well...

14:35.959 --> 14:37.625
...it didn't come from me.

14:47.208 --> 14:51.834
And be the warrioress.
Drop into the belly.

14:51.917 --> 14:55.250
Be in the belly and then inhale,
reach up,

14:55.333 --> 14:57.834
express your heart
to the heavens.

14:57.917 --> 15:01.542
And exhale, release it down
to the earth.

15:01.625 --> 15:05.375
And stepping back
to downward-facing dog.

15:05.458 --> 15:10.333
Just sway the hips gently
from side to side. That's it.

15:10.417 --> 15:14.208
- [phone ringing]
- Very easy. Keep breathing.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.667
- [exhales]
- [woman] Ahh.

15:18.166 --> 15:21.125
[clears throat]
May I have that, please?

15:23.917 --> 15:26.875
Ladies, these are tools
of negative energy.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.458
Your babies can feel
that energy.

15:29.542 --> 15:32.625
Please turn it off. All right.

15:32.709 --> 15:34.333
Take a last deep breath,

15:34.417 --> 15:36.709
and on the exhale walk
your feet forward

15:36.792 --> 15:38.458
and come on up to standing.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.834
[gong rings]

15:40.917 --> 15:43.208
It's time to dance
with our babies.

15:43.291 --> 15:46.125
[Indian-style music plays]

15:55.125 --> 15:59.083
[woman] You are Shakti,
mother of the universe.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.208
Feel your heartbeat blending

16:01.291 --> 16:04.000
with the baby
with the beat of the drum.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.792
- Primal mother energy.
- Come on, sweetie.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.875
Gotta go. OK?

16:25.083 --> 16:27.417
Huh? You feeling good?
You feeling good?

16:28.959 --> 16:30.792
- [slapping]
- Ah!

16:30.875 --> 16:33.166
Jeez, man.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.083
- Yeah, that was a foul.
- You think?

16:35.166 --> 16:37.291
I'm just happy
my arm's still attached.

16:37.375 --> 16:40.208
Just take it up
one time, all right?

16:40.291 --> 16:42.792
Hold up a sec. You know
what I've noticed lately?

16:42.875 --> 16:45.291
We've been playing ball
the last four months

16:45.375 --> 16:48.583
and the closer to your wedding
day, the harder you foul me.

16:48.667 --> 16:52.166
- Yeah? What's your point?
- Don't take out
your nervousness on me.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.625
Hey, I am not nervous.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.625
Yeah, well, maybe you should be.

16:57.709 --> 17:00.083
Ivy's been working
on her speech all day.

17:00.166 --> 17:03.959
- She's your wife. Control her.
- Control her?

17:04.041 --> 17:07.166
Bro, you got a lot
to learn about marriage.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.834
You should've been at my
wedding. Talk about nervous?

17:11.917 --> 17:14.583
Her parents are this white
couple from Yorba Linda.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.625
That wedding had more black
people than they'd ever seen.

17:17.709 --> 17:20.750
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

17:20.834 --> 17:24.041
- I just came to shoot around.
- Well, we're almost done here.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.542
That's my friend Jimmy.
We work at the firm.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.166
Hey... Jimmy.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.375
Hey.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.834
No. "Hey, Jimmy."

17:33.917 --> 17:36.709
Look, it's not funny, Brian.
OK? I get it.

17:36.792 --> 17:40.041
- Good. I have no idea
what's going on.
- It's this thing Adam and I do.

17:40.125 --> 17:43.083
Whenever we spot a hot girl,
we always say, "Hey, Jimmy."

17:46.333 --> 17:47.875
I don't see any hot girls.

17:47.959 --> 17:52.125
I said it this time because
it's your name. Not because...

17:52.208 --> 17:54.750
You know what? Forget it.
Now it just seems dumb.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.125
I gotta go.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.166
- I'll see you tonight?
- Yeah.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.041
- Seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah, look.
I gotta go too, Bri.

18:08.125 --> 18:11.375
- No, you don't.
You took the day off.
- I'm getting married tomorrow.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.875
I've got a few things
I need to do.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.625
Like what? What?
Get your hair done?

18:15.709 --> 18:18.375
Everyone knows the groom
has nothing to do at all.

18:18.458 --> 18:21.125
Come on. Right now, you and me.
One on one.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.583
If you win, I owe you 50.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.959
If I win, you stop
acting like an ass.

18:28.417 --> 18:31.417
All right. First to 11.
Win by two.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.917
[Marjorie] I've wanted
to come into one of these.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.417
I just never have until today.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.583
Wanna know if you're marrying
the right guy?

19:03.667 --> 19:05.083
I get a lot of business,

19:05.166 --> 19:07.083
right down the street
from a bridal shop.

19:07.166 --> 19:08.792
I'm marrying the right guy.

19:09.667 --> 19:12.208
I'm getting a B.

19:12.291 --> 19:15.917
Does your fiancé's name
start with a B?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.208
You know what I just remembered?

19:18.291 --> 19:22.542
I have a hair appointment,
and so I need to go.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.291
No, don't go.
There are many different ways
to interpret the cards.

19:26.375 --> 19:31.417
What did you come in for?
You must have a reason.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.291
I wanted to know if my husband
and I are gonna be happy.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.709
- Does his name start with a B?
- No.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.667
Is there a B?

19:40.959 --> 19:43.458
Yes, OK? Yes. Fine.

19:43.542 --> 19:46.792
Fine, there's a B.
But it's not...

19:46.875 --> 19:50.500
It's not real, I know it's not
real. You know? He's a friend.

19:50.583 --> 19:55.208
He's a really good friend and
he's spontaneous and soulful,

19:55.291 --> 19:58.041
and he's a little indecisive.
And there's Adam.

19:58.125 --> 20:01.125
And he has this swagger to him.
He knows what he wants.

20:01.208 --> 20:04.291
It's sexy and it makes me feel
safe. And I wanna get married.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.333
You know, I wanna have a family.

20:07.417 --> 20:11.750
Cut the cards, dear.
Let's see what they have to say.

20:22.709 --> 20:24.917
The Lovers.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Happiness and harmony
with your man.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.417
So far, so good.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Two of Pentacles.
Signifying a journey.

20:34.083 --> 20:37.458
- We're going to Bali.
- Well, there you go.

20:44.917 --> 20:48.083
- What's that?
- The Ace of Swords.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.125
It can mean many things.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.792
Right now, I would say
it represents

20:53.875 --> 20:55.667
the trouble in your heart.

20:58.959 --> 21:00.709
To marry one man,

21:00.792 --> 21:05.458
you have to give up on the dream
of possibility with another.

21:05.542 --> 21:09.125
That's just the truth,
for any bride.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.083
Game point.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.208
[grunting]

21:32.667 --> 21:34.959
I win. You can send
the 50 in the mail.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.583
- Hey, Daddy's here!
- [Deena] Hey.

21:44.667 --> 21:46.208
You're home early.

21:46.291 --> 21:49.417
Yeah. I wanted to work
on my speech for tonight.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.250
- Your speech?
- [Dave] Yeah.

21:51.333 --> 21:55.041
Adam wants me to give a speech
about marriage.

21:55.125 --> 21:58.333
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

22:00.834 --> 22:04.917
I... I got you that gift.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.083
- The one Dr. Bill
wanted us to get.
- I did too.

22:08.166 --> 22:10.417
- You did?
- I did.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.917
- Shall we do it?
- OK.

22:30.166 --> 22:32.917
- Didn't know we had a dolly.
- Oh, I pinched it.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.583
- Workmen left it
out in the street.
- Sweet.

22:41.208 --> 22:45.041
I think we should open 'em
at exactly the same time. Ready?

22:49.667 --> 22:51.208
Wow.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.041
- It's bunk beds.
- And...

22:57.125 --> 22:58.500
What is...?

22:58.583 --> 23:01.959
I just... You know, the fantasy
that we had where I tied you up?

23:02.041 --> 23:05.125
So I... You don't like 'em.

23:05.208 --> 23:09.333
Well, it's just that this
is a present for you, Dave.

23:09.417 --> 23:11.959
You know, it's not really
a present for me.

23:12.041 --> 23:14.917
Who are the bunk beds for?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.375
For the girls, but for us.

23:17.458 --> 23:20.333
To get them out of our room. I
thought that's what you wanted.

23:20.417 --> 23:23.166
That's what I want.
I appreciate it. I just...

23:23.250 --> 23:26.250
You're still disappointed. Yeah.

23:26.333 --> 23:29.333
You know, I just think
that I can't please you,

23:29.417 --> 23:30.625
no matter what I do.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.625
You don't like
the handcuffs either.

23:32.709 --> 23:34.959
What makes you think
I wanna be tied up, Dave?

23:35.041 --> 23:38.208
I just thought it might be fun.
Forget it. Just give 'em to me.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.083
No, I really wanna know
what was in your mind,

23:41.166 --> 23:42.709
when you bought these.

23:44.333 --> 23:46.417
You wanted
an open marriage, Deena.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.417
Why? Because
our sex life is boring?

23:48.500 --> 23:51.625
So I just thought, "What the
hell? Why don't we spice it up?"

23:51.709 --> 23:54.041
- Our problem is not sex.
- What's our problem?

23:54.125 --> 23:56.208
There's something
missing for you.

23:56.291 --> 23:58.542
And if you don't want me...

23:58.625 --> 24:01.250
The problem is
you cannot forgive me!

24:01.333 --> 24:03.583
You're just still
so angry about...

24:03.667 --> 24:06.083
About what?

24:06.166 --> 24:07.959
- About Richard?
- Yes.

24:08.041 --> 24:11.208
I'm not angry about Richard.
Richard is a jerk.

24:11.291 --> 24:16.208
From what I hear,
he's working his way through
every mom in the carpool line!

24:18.500 --> 24:21.166
You just can't stop, can you?

24:25.709 --> 24:28.709
I really can't wait to hear
your big speech about marriage,

24:28.792 --> 24:30.750
because, right now,
I don't think

24:30.834 --> 24:33.083
either of us knows
anything about it.

24:34.583 --> 24:35.667
Fine.

24:44.125 --> 24:46.250
- Thanks.
- [piano playing]

24:46.333 --> 24:48.750
- Hey, Brian, right?
- Hey, Jimmy.

24:48.834 --> 24:52.417
- A hot girl, right?
- No. Now it's just your name.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.917
Oh. Hey, um, Adam's staying
at the hotel tonight,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.208
and we thought a bunch of us

24:56.291 --> 24:58.250
would take him out
to a strip club.

24:58.333 --> 25:01.291
One last night of innocent
debauchery. You up for it?

25:01.375 --> 25:03.959
- Did Adam invite me?
- He doesn't know.

25:04.041 --> 25:06.709
- You know,
we're gonna surprise him.
- Sure.

25:06.792 --> 25:08.792
- Sure, I'd love to come.
- Cool.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.583
I'll holler at you later
and let you know what's...

25:11.667 --> 25:14.250
Hello, everyone.
You all good and drunk?

25:14.333 --> 25:17.083
- I better get back.
- It's customary at these things

25:17.166 --> 25:20.083
for a friend of the bride
and the groom to give a toast.

25:20.166 --> 25:23.959
So I'm gonna do it 'cause I've
had a few and I think it's time.

25:24.041 --> 25:26.542
So I'm Ivy, and, my husband...

25:26.625 --> 25:31.625
There he is, my husband, Jimmy.
He works at the firm with Adam.

25:31.709 --> 25:34.959
I own a bar
and this gang from the firm,

25:35.041 --> 25:36.750
they like to come
and hang out there.

25:36.834 --> 25:39.458
I happen to know
that every single woman

25:39.542 --> 25:42.333
has a huge crush on this guy
right here, Adam Hillman.

25:42.417 --> 25:43.667
[cheering]

25:43.750 --> 25:45.458
- Yes.
- [Jimmy] Yeah, it's true.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.750
- There you are, ma'am.
- Thanks.

25:52.542 --> 25:55.375
Oh, thank you.

25:55.458 --> 25:58.166
- You don't want dessert?
- Gestational diabetes.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.667
I don't wanna get it.

25:59.750 --> 26:02.000
You shouldn't
eat that cheese either.

26:02.083 --> 26:04.875
It might not be pasteurized.

26:04.959 --> 26:08.208
I know a woman who had
a bacterial infection...

26:08.291 --> 26:10.000
Thanks.

26:10.083 --> 26:12.667
- I'm gonna be
a terrible mother.
- Stop.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.583
I eat cheese, I dye my hair.

26:14.667 --> 26:17.458
- I can't dance with my baby.
- What?

26:17.542 --> 26:20.250
Dance. With my baby.
Apparently everyone does it.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.667
You should see these women
at this yoga class.

26:22.750 --> 26:25.250
The looks on their faces.
They were so into it.

26:25.333 --> 26:28.959
- Well, you'll get into it.
- When, Bri? When?

26:30.458 --> 26:34.542
I want to feel happy
and excited...

26:34.625 --> 26:38.208
...but mostly
what I feel... is afraid.

26:38.291 --> 26:41.166
Afraid that I'm gonna lose it,
that I'm gonna hurt it

26:41.250 --> 26:43.208
or be the wrong sort of mother.

26:43.291 --> 26:47.375
You are gonna be a great mother.
You know how I know?

26:47.458 --> 26:50.875
Because when I was
a kid, and you went off
to college, I was so sad.

26:50.959 --> 26:54.250
I laid in bed and
asked God to make you
my mother instead of Mom

26:54.333 --> 26:56.041
so we could always be together.

26:56.125 --> 26:58.333
You asked God
to make the dog your mother.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.041
Well, we both did.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.250
[dinging on glass]

27:01.333 --> 27:05.208
Uh... hi, everybody.

27:05.291 --> 27:08.417
I'm Adam's best man, Dave Greco.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.917
I'm the old married man
of the group.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.375
So... Well, I just wanna
say to you guys that...

27:17.500 --> 27:20.542
...marriage is kinda like
a dirty coffee mug.

27:20.625 --> 27:23.458
You start out
all sparkly and creamy

27:23.542 --> 27:25.750
and new, and then
you end up all...

27:27.500 --> 27:32.417
...brown and... cracked.

27:37.834 --> 27:40.041
Here's the thing.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.667
I'm supposed to be the guy
who gives words of wisdom

27:42.750 --> 27:44.583
because I've been married
for so long,

27:44.667 --> 27:47.000
and the truth is
that I don't know crap.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.750
Really.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.834
And I only know one thing.

27:50.917 --> 27:53.792
- Deena, could you stand up?
- No.

27:53.875 --> 27:57.792
Please, honey, I'm dying here.
I need you to help me out.

27:57.875 --> 28:01.291
Yeah. You gotta stand up now.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.750
There's a really great story
behind this.

28:03.834 --> 28:06.834
It's about bunk beds
and keys and...

28:06.917 --> 28:08.583
You don't wanna know.

28:08.667 --> 28:12.458
Anyway, this is my wife, Deena.
We've been married for 13 years.

28:12.542 --> 28:14.542
[applause]

28:20.583 --> 28:22.750
And I love her.

28:22.834 --> 28:27.208
I mean, I truly love this woman.

28:29.417 --> 28:32.709
As much as I did
the day she walked into
my dorm room 15 years ago

28:32.792 --> 28:34.792
- and asked to borrow my bong.
- Yeah.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.041
And as far as advice
on marriage,

28:38.125 --> 28:40.959
the only thing
I can tell you is that,

28:41.041 --> 28:44.000
when you're fighting
and you're having problems

28:44.083 --> 28:46.667
and maybe even thinking
it might not work out,

28:46.750 --> 28:51.792
just... take a second to imagine
your life without her.

28:55.208 --> 28:56.750
Really, just... take a minute

28:56.834 --> 29:01.375
and think about all the things
that you love about her.

29:03.333 --> 29:07.417
I don't, um...
I don't do that enough.

29:08.542 --> 29:10.792
But I'm doing it tonight.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.375
I love you.

29:14.458 --> 29:16.542
I love you too, baby.

29:29.333 --> 29:32.542
I'd like to make an announcement
for the wedding tomorrow.

29:32.625 --> 29:34.250
There's one more speech
to give.

29:34.333 --> 29:35.834
Sorry. Speech time's over.

29:35.917 --> 29:37.542
I got props.

29:41.458 --> 29:43.375
Look, I...

29:43.458 --> 29:47.375
I met Adam
when we were eight years old.

29:47.458 --> 29:49.542
My parents
had just gotten divorced,

29:49.625 --> 29:51.583
I'd moved to Chicago
with my mother,

29:51.667 --> 29:55.542
and all the kids thought I was
a bozo with my mullet and...

29:55.625 --> 29:57.542
...they were teasing me,

29:57.625 --> 30:00.125
and Adam sort of
appeared out of the crowd

30:00.208 --> 30:01.625
and told 'em to shut up.

30:03.834 --> 30:06.417
We've been backing
each other up ever since.

30:06.500 --> 30:10.083
Especially at the big moments,
like high school graduation,

30:10.166 --> 30:14.250
when my father didn't show up
and my mother was working and...

30:14.333 --> 30:19.125
Adam gave me what I knew
was his most prized possession.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.750
That baseball.

30:21.834 --> 30:23.875
It was signed by Andre Dawson.

30:23.959 --> 30:26.250
He was the National League MVP
for the Cubs in '87,

30:26.333 --> 30:28.625
and we used to wait for him
after every game.

30:28.709 --> 30:32.917
And on graduation day
he gave that ball to me.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.959
Just knowing he'd do that for me

30:36.041 --> 30:38.458
got me through a huge
transition,

30:38.542 --> 30:40.709
and tonight I want
to give it back to him.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.542
Because there's no bigger
transition than marriage.

30:47.792 --> 30:52.667
And I want you to know
I'm still backing you up.

30:52.750 --> 30:56.542
[applause]

31:11.667 --> 31:15.417
[man] Don't leave, guys.
Cheyenne's up next
on stage two!

31:17.208 --> 31:20.834
- Hi, my name's Betty Sue.
- Hiya.

31:20.917 --> 31:23.750
- You boys want a lap dance?
- He does. He's the groom!

31:23.834 --> 31:25.333
- No! No, no, no.
- Really?

31:25.417 --> 31:27.667
- When's the big day?
- Tomorrow!

31:27.750 --> 31:29.458
I bet I can make you
change your mind.

31:29.542 --> 31:31.542
I... Yeah... No, thank you.

31:31.625 --> 31:35.333
All right. Let me know.

31:35.417 --> 31:37.542
- Bye. See ya.
- Bye, boys!

31:39.208 --> 31:41.625
I can only have one drink,
and then I gotta go.

31:41.709 --> 31:44.291
Come on. You can't do that.
You're the best man.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.834
- Substitute best man.
- You're the real deal.

31:46.917 --> 31:50.125
- All right,
let me make one call.
- Don't call your wife.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.166
- Why?
- Don't be that guy.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.500
Oh, fine.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.542
Why do all women
look good naked?

31:58.625 --> 32:02.125
- They don't
all look good naked.
- Yeah, yeah, they kinda do.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.458
Hey, Jimmy.

32:06.667 --> 32:09.208
Oh, please. Come over here.

32:11.041 --> 32:13.000
Hi. I'm Summer.

32:13.083 --> 32:17.208
- Hi, Summer.
- Anyone want a lap dance?

32:17.291 --> 32:19.583
Yes. Yes, please.

32:22.792 --> 32:24.375
I brought something.

32:24.458 --> 32:27.041
Well, it can't be booze
and it can't be chocolate,

32:27.125 --> 32:30.333
because I am not eating anything
until after the wedding.

32:30.417 --> 32:34.834
- No...
- Oh, my God.
Are those tarot cards?

32:34.917 --> 32:36.834
- I already did that.
- What?

32:36.917 --> 32:39.458
Today I went to see a psychic.

32:39.542 --> 32:42.083
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

32:42.166 --> 32:44.583
My grandmother
used to read these cards to me.

32:44.667 --> 32:46.834
She taught me
everything I know. So...

32:47.875 --> 32:49.417
- Do me.
- OK.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.959
Put your hand on the card,
and now cut the deck.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.875
Now, take the top card.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.542
Let me see.

33:00.625 --> 33:04.917
The Knight of Wands.
You're having a girl.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.375
- You're next.
- No.

33:08.458 --> 33:10.500
- I don't wanna do it again.
- Come on.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.750
And cut the deck.

33:16.667 --> 33:18.667
Now, flip it over.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.792
The Ace of Swords.

33:31.875 --> 33:34.667
I got that same card
this afternoon.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.125
What did she say it meant?

33:36.208 --> 33:38.667
She said that it meant

33:38.750 --> 33:41.709
that I had to give up
on the possibility of other men,

33:42.542 --> 33:44.333
like any bride.

33:44.417 --> 33:46.500
Hmm.

33:47.750 --> 33:50.625
- What?
- Nothing.

33:50.709 --> 33:54.208
No, it's just not what, you
know, my grandma said it meant.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.750
Well, I'm sure
it has many meanings, right?

33:58.834 --> 34:01.208
Well, what did
your grandmother say?

34:03.208 --> 34:04.875
It means betrayal.

34:12.333 --> 34:15.500
- What's your girl's name?
- Marjorie.

34:15.583 --> 34:18.041
- What does she do?
- She's a doctor.

34:18.125 --> 34:21.458
Really? I'm studying
to be a chiropractor.

34:21.542 --> 34:25.125
Really? Nice, nice.
There's a good future in that.

34:25.208 --> 34:27.792
- And what do you do?
- I'm a lawyer.

34:27.875 --> 34:30.333
- Big lawyer.
- Big, big lawyer. Yeah.

34:30.417 --> 34:32.583
Lucky children
you two are gonna have.

34:39.417 --> 34:42.417

Right. It's Eleanor.

35:03.417 --> 35:06.625

your fake fake stripper name.

35:06.709 --> 35:09.083
Yes.

35:09.166 --> 35:13.500
Listen, there's a private room
in the back.

35:13.583 --> 35:17.792
Private dance. It's more money,
but... more fun too.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.834
- Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.
- All right.

35:21.917 --> 35:23.917
Well... you think about it,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.250
and I will go and see
if one is available.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.834
OK.

35:31.166 --> 35:33.125
- God, should I do it?
- Hell, yeah.

35:33.208 --> 35:37.083
- No, of course
you shouldn't do it.
- Why not?

35:37.166 --> 35:39.083
You're getting married tomorrow.

35:39.166 --> 35:41.458
No thanks to you.

Look, I left!

35:46.166 --> 35:48.458

I didn't wanna screw things up!

It just happened!

You kissed her?
