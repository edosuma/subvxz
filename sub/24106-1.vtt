[Kefilwe] Yes.

05:46.136 --> 05:48.573
When did your daughter

05:49.906 --> 05:52.576
She disappeared

[speaks foreign language]

07:24.266 --> 07:25.269
[Kruger] Stop!

07:28.271 --> 07:29.904
For fuck sake!

07:29.906 --> 07:31.805
I been searched a dozen
times already, Kruger.

07:31.807 --> 07:34.611
And now you get
searched again, Blomfeld.

07:39.182 --> 07:40.348
You looking
for some hospital time

07:40.350 --> 07:41.986
and a compensation claim, boy?

07:44.221 --> 07:46.286
[prison guard] Come. Walk.

07:46.288 --> 07:48.091
[prisoner]
[speaks foreign language]

08:02.439 --> 08:04.975
[sirens blaring in distance]

08:06.709 --> 08:09.144
The fuck are you staring
at, <i>kaffir?</i>

08:09.146 --> 08:10.978
[governor] Not in my office,

08:10.980 --> 08:12.312
unless you want me to throw this

08:12.314 --> 08:13.882
in the waste bin.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.186
[prison guard]
[chuckles]

08:17.721 --> 08:19.788
Prisoner Blomfeld,

08:19.790 --> 08:21.690
do you seriously think
the Archbishop

08:21.692 --> 08:23.724
is going to bother
to read this?

08:23.726 --> 08:25.926
Let alone come
all the way out here

08:25.928 --> 08:28.198
to see a convicted
death squad assassin?

08:32.201 --> 08:34.038
Dismissed!
Get him out of here.

08:39.710 --> 08:41.645
Check you later, <i>poes.</i>

08:50.721 --> 08:51.953
Well...

08:51.955 --> 08:53.754
they're right.

08:53.756 --> 08:55.790
The tumor is halted,
Your Grace.

08:55.792 --> 08:59.127
But it's too early
to be speaking of remission.

08:59.129 --> 09:00.762
Only time will tell.

09:00.764 --> 09:02.229
So I can be run over

09:02.231 --> 09:04.098
by a bus tomorrow

09:04.100 --> 09:06.968
and then I'll die
a healthy man.

09:06.970 --> 09:07.969
[laughs]

09:07.971 --> 09:09.903
I heard your interview

09:09.905 --> 09:11.839
on the radio.

09:11.841 --> 09:14.041
Truth and reconciliation
between all sides

09:14.043 --> 09:16.444
would be a fine thing.

09:16.446 --> 09:17.945
But it's too early

09:17.947 --> 09:19.247
for us to be speaking
of remission?

09:19.249 --> 09:21.916
May I have a word
in private, Doctor Biehl,

09:21.918 --> 09:24.919
away from these ears
of this old goat?

09:24.921 --> 09:27.287
She's going to ask you
to ask me

09:27.289 --> 09:29.924
- to rest.
- No. I'm going to tell him

09:29.926 --> 09:32.026
to order you to rest.

09:32.028 --> 09:34.896
[Tutu] When Mandela
asked me to head

09:34.898 --> 09:38.932
the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission,

09:38.934 --> 09:41.835
he gave me a choice

09:41.837 --> 09:44.138
precisely because he knew

09:44.140 --> 09:46.840
I had no choice.

09:46.842 --> 09:50.180
When the President speaks...

09:51.248 --> 09:52.781
we have no choice,

09:52.783 --> 09:54.348
do we, Doctor?

09:54.350 --> 09:55.517
[Biehl] It seems not.

09:55.519 --> 09:58.520
Exactly! See?

09:58.522 --> 09:59.857
Move.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.291
[Sise] We grant amnesty
to a black face,

10:03.293 --> 10:05.826
we are accused
of being biased;

10:05.828 --> 10:08.061
if we grant amnesty
to a white,

10:08.063 --> 10:10.931
we are accused of being
Boer stooges.

10:10.933 --> 10:12.300
- It's impossible.
- [Mary Burton] Sise,

10:12.302 --> 10:14.134
difficult is not
the same thing as impossible,

10:14.136 --> 10:15.969
is it, Archbishop?

10:15.971 --> 10:17.774
Two politicians

10:19.042 --> 10:20.211
are deadlocked.

10:21.278 --> 10:23.177
In the end...

10:23.179 --> 10:25.814
one says,

10:25.816 --> 10:27.181
"Look,

10:27.183 --> 10:30.285
I'll admit I'm wrong

10:30.287 --> 10:33.923
if you'll admit I'm right."

10:35.457 --> 10:37.559
"Agreed, agreed,

10:37.561 --> 10:40.195
but you go first."

10:40.197 --> 10:41.896
"Okay.

10:41.898 --> 10:44.833
I'm wrong,"

10:44.835 --> 10:46.300
says the first politician.

10:46.302 --> 10:48.435
And the second politician yells,

10:48.437 --> 10:50.140
he yells,

10:52.341 --> 10:54.175
"You're right!
You're right!

10:54.177 --> 10:56.009
You are wrong!
You are wrong!"

10:56.011 --> 10:58.378
[laughter]

10:58.380 --> 11:00.283
Bish, it's for you

11:05.322 --> 11:08.890
Good people all over the world

11:08.892 --> 11:11.859
are praying for our success.

11:11.861 --> 11:13.361
Well, maybe they need

11:13.363 --> 11:16.196
to pray a bit harder.

11:16.198 --> 11:18.031
[Tutu] Oh, Alex, have hope.

11:18.033 --> 11:21.236
[Lavinia] No. You're gonna need
stamina, leading that lot.

11:21.238 --> 11:25.039
[Tutu] Yes. But if
the Commission can weld itself

11:25.041 --> 11:28.877
into somewhat
of a united group,

11:28.879 --> 11:31.882
then there's hope
for the nation.

11:35.585 --> 11:37.153
[sighs]

11:48.097 --> 11:50.067
[Lavinia]
Is that Blomfeld's letter?

11:51.301 --> 11:52.633
Yes, it is.

11:52.635 --> 11:54.134
Which should have been shredded,

11:54.136 --> 11:56.070
as I advised.

11:56.072 --> 11:58.640
I can't get it out
of my head, Vinnie.

11:58.642 --> 12:01.975
It is... it's so articulate.

12:01.977 --> 12:05.216
He quotes Plato's <i>Republic</i>

12:06.548 --> 12:08.650
and...

12:08.652 --> 12:11.386
John Milton.

12:11.388 --> 12:13.988
It's just...

12:13.990 --> 12:15.589
it's quite engaging.

12:15.591 --> 12:17.557
[Lavinia] Don't go to Pollsmoor,

12:17.559 --> 12:19.093
that's my advice.

12:19.095 --> 12:22.497
He's, um, only out
to harm you, you know,

12:22.499 --> 12:24.531
he'll try and destroy you.

12:24.533 --> 12:25.967
Don't exaggerate.

12:25.969 --> 12:28.136
- Don't.
- [Lavinia] Father,

12:28.138 --> 12:30.438
he's a psychopath
and a convicted killer.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.006
I know who he is.

12:32.008 --> 12:33.143
[Lavinia] Well, then?

12:36.312 --> 12:38.046
No one...

12:38.048 --> 12:40.681
is beyond redemption, Vinnie.

12:40.683 --> 12:43.620
[indistinct chatter]

13:01.136 --> 13:03.438
[suspenseful music playing]

13:03.440 --> 13:06.373
Hmm.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.508
[Tannoy] <i>Prisoner Blomfeld,
go to C-Block.</i>

13:08.510 --> 13:10.146
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

13:12.048 --> 13:14.482
- [prisoner] Oh. All right.
- [prisoner] Nice one.

13:14.484 --> 13:16.184
[Blomfeld] Bloody Hell.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.354
He fell over.

13:56.625 --> 13:59.562
[chains clattering]

14:04.567 --> 14:07.504
[indistinct radio chatter]

14:12.542 --> 14:14.144
- [door closes]
- [Tutu] Thank you, Sergeant.

14:16.779 --> 14:18.546
[Blomfeld]
<i>The fucking prison bastard</i>

14:18.548 --> 14:20.314
told me you wouldn't come.

14:20.316 --> 14:22.650
"No way," he said.

14:22.652 --> 14:23.718
But I knew you would come.

14:23.720 --> 14:24.786
I knew you wouldn't be able

14:24.788 --> 14:27.454
to resist it.

14:27.456 --> 14:29.424
Genius.

14:29.426 --> 14:31.324
[Tutu] Well, you are sure

14:31.326 --> 14:33.094
that I would come,

14:33.096 --> 14:36.033
so I'm sure
that you are prepared.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.398
Don't play with me, bru.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.834
Don't delude yourself.

14:39.836 --> 14:41.368
Delude myself?

14:41.370 --> 14:43.570
[Blomfeld] Thinking
you can get inside here.

14:43.572 --> 14:45.272
[Tutu] <i>Well, then</i>

14:45.274 --> 14:47.241
<i>let's stop the games</i>

14:47.243 --> 14:48.810
before they go any further.

14:48.812 --> 14:51.112
This is no fucking game,
<i>kaffir.</i>

14:51.114 --> 14:53.182
Hey. Hmm.

14:56.719 --> 14:58.188
"Father."

14:59.621 --> 15:02.025
"Father"...will do.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.259
You got to be
kidding yourself

15:06.261 --> 15:08.429
that what's gonna
happen here is random.

15:08.431 --> 15:10.230
I've read all about you.

15:10.232 --> 15:11.331
Studied it.

15:11.333 --> 15:12.566
I've got plenty of time to do

15:12.568 --> 15:13.569
what I need to do.

15:15.738 --> 15:18.473
Mr. Blomfeld,

15:18.475 --> 15:21.045
what is it that you want?

15:22.745 --> 15:24.681
Is it amnesty?

15:27.283 --> 15:28.815
And if it is?

15:28.817 --> 15:30.417
[Tutu] Well, now,

15:30.419 --> 15:32.652
I'm not saying that I can even

15:32.654 --> 15:35.623
consider your application.

15:35.625 --> 15:38.825
But if you want to be free,

15:38.827 --> 15:41.462
from then part of the process

15:41.464 --> 15:43.131
in seeking amnesty...

15:43.133 --> 15:44.699
"Involves making a full

15:44.701 --> 15:46.133
and frank confession,

15:46.135 --> 15:47.535
leaving nothing out."

15:47.537 --> 15:49.637
I know, I can bloody read.

15:49.639 --> 15:52.339
You will have
to seek forgiveness.

15:52.341 --> 15:54.541
You must ask for it.

15:54.543 --> 15:56.310
Forgiveness?

15:56.312 --> 15:58.778
Forgiveness for what?

15:58.780 --> 16:01.616
For offing some black
bastard thieving scum

16:01.618 --> 16:04.151
- trying to steal my country?
- It's our country.

16:04.153 --> 16:05.619
Fuck that! Your country.

16:05.621 --> 16:07.787
What have your people
ever done to build it?

16:07.789 --> 16:10.791
Two years ago,
we had an election.

16:10.793 --> 16:13.227
A free election,

16:13.229 --> 16:15.897
where anyone who wanted

16:15.899 --> 16:19.333
to vote could do so

16:19.335 --> 16:21.872
without violence.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.577
Now, that is an achievement.

16:29.711 --> 16:32.647
That's what helps you sleep
easy at night, is it?

16:32.649 --> 16:35.182
Pride in your achievement,

16:35.184 --> 16:36.449
hmm?

16:36.451 --> 16:38.422
- Listen, boy...
- Uh-uh,

16:39.489 --> 16:42.559
"Father." We agreed on that.

16:44.193 --> 16:47.527
How does it feel...
hmm?...

16:47.529 --> 16:50.498
...colluding with your
former white masters?

16:50.500 --> 16:52.532
Colluding?

16:52.534 --> 16:54.502
- In what way?
- [Blomfeld] Once a slave,

16:54.504 --> 16:56.270
always a slave.

16:56.272 --> 16:58.205
Your white masters
haven't gone away,

16:58.207 --> 16:59.473
have they?

16:59.475 --> 17:00.608
You're still serving them

17:00.610 --> 17:02.209
the same <i>kak!</i>

17:02.211 --> 17:03.611
Except now it's called

17:03.613 --> 17:06.213
"reconciliation".

17:06.214 --> 17:07.614
You're covering them,

17:07.616 --> 17:09.683
that's what it amounts to.

17:09.685 --> 17:11.885
Come on,

17:11.887 --> 17:12.953
be honest,

17:12.954 --> 17:15.222
it's easy if you try.

17:15.223 --> 17:17.892
We either learn to live together

17:17.894 --> 17:19.794
in this country

17:19.796 --> 17:21.695
or we will die together

17:21.698 --> 17:23.663
in this country.

17:23.665 --> 17:25.665
Well done, <i>kaffir!</i>

17:25.666 --> 17:27.300
[speaking foreign language]

17:27.303 --> 17:29.636
You've grasped
the bottom line.

17:29.638 --> 17:33.306
Life is one animal
eating another.

17:33.308 --> 17:34.709
Death is one animal

17:34.711 --> 17:35.910
being eaten by another.

17:35.912 --> 17:37.878
You either have a full belly

17:37.880 --> 17:38.946
or you're in a full belly.

17:38.948 --> 17:41.615
Darwin. Unalterable facts.

17:41.617 --> 17:43.517
The rest is just
window dressing.

17:43.519 --> 17:44.788
Chintz.

17:46.422 --> 17:48.258
We are all God's children.

17:49.558 --> 17:51.258
We are all connected

17:51.260 --> 17:53.363
by a common humanity.

17:55.431 --> 17:58.535
I could tell you a thing
or two about humanity,

18:00.002 --> 18:01.802
about what's buried
in the red earth

18:01.804 --> 18:04.541
of this country, hmm?

18:06.342 --> 18:08.508
About "Disappearing,"

18:08.510 --> 18:11.011
about the "Elimination,"

18:11.013 --> 18:14.315
about the "Unconventional
Operational Methods,"

18:14.317 --> 18:16.920
about "Hit Squads,"
about "Hacksaw".

18:19.388 --> 18:21.488
Oh, yeah.

18:21.490 --> 18:25.295
So you think we share
a common humanity, <i>kaffir?</i>

18:26.996 --> 18:28.828
We are...

18:28.830 --> 18:32.033
all capable of acts
of depravity.

18:32.035 --> 18:33.668
[Blomfeld] Even you? Yes?

18:33.670 --> 18:35.469
Yes, even me.

18:35.471 --> 18:37.505
Good boy!

18:37.507 --> 18:39.673
Now, the truth: when you sit
on that commission of yours,

18:39.675 --> 18:41.444
don't tell me
you don't feel anger?

18:42.811 --> 18:44.879
Oh, I feel anger.

18:44.881 --> 18:47.515
[Blomfeld]
And you wonder, don't you?

18:47.517 --> 18:48.849
Why God just doesn't

18:48.851 --> 18:50.517
fucking wipe the slate clean

18:50.519 --> 18:52.355
of his two-legged creation?

18:54.990 --> 18:57.627
Sometimes I wonder that.

19:02.798 --> 19:05.032
I feel sorry for you,

19:05.034 --> 19:06.536
mission-school boy.

19:08.371 --> 19:11.338
Turn the other cheek, hey?

19:11.340 --> 19:14.607
To forgive is a choice

19:14.609 --> 19:17.378
made by other ordinary people

19:17.380 --> 19:19.447
much more courageous

19:19.449 --> 19:22.382
- than I will ever be.
- Ah! Come on!

19:22.384 --> 19:24.785
Be a man. Own the fire
in your belly.

19:24.787 --> 19:27.755
- Go for it.
- I refuse your version

19:27.757 --> 19:29.590
of humanity,

19:29.592 --> 19:31.926
and I intend to continue

19:31.928 --> 19:33.827
to struggle...

19:33.829 --> 19:34.897
against it.

19:40.769 --> 19:42.873
How many on that commission
of yours are priests?

19:45.607 --> 19:47.107
Four.

19:47.109 --> 19:49.910
Clever, our leaders,
aren't they?

19:49.912 --> 19:53.413
Forgiveness is fucking baked
into the cake.

19:53.415 --> 19:54.949
Civil war,

19:54.951 --> 19:57.653
which you seem to want,

19:59.055 --> 20:01.654
is not in anyone's interest.

20:01.656 --> 20:04.124
[Blomfeld] A blood bath
is inevitable.

20:04.126 --> 20:05.492
It's pure.

20:05.494 --> 20:07.527
It's honest!

20:07.529 --> 20:09.430
Out of the bloodbath

20:09.432 --> 20:11.431
emerges the victor.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.133
The stronger, the superior,

20:13.135 --> 20:15.672
who the weak and inferior
have to kneel before.

20:20.076 --> 20:21.409
You'll fail today

20:21.411 --> 20:22.846
or you'll fail tomorrow.

20:24.446 --> 20:26.479
I'm right, aren't I, <i>kaffir?</i>

20:26.481 --> 20:28.548
I can see it in your face,
you see,

20:28.550 --> 20:30.116
I want the war between us

20:30.118 --> 20:32.620
to drag us all
into the bloody vortex,

20:32.622 --> 20:34.955
because the winner
who emerges,

20:34.957 --> 20:36.790
listen to me,

20:36.792 --> 20:38.627
will be white.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Visit's over.

20:47.002 --> 20:48.471
The visit's over!

20:52.909 --> 20:56.546
Why did you ask me
to come here, Mr. Blomfeld?

20:58.146 --> 21:01.451
To offer you the very thing
you thought to offer me.

21:02.518 --> 21:05.486
Enlightenment.

21:05.488 --> 21:06.987
We've been parading

21:06.989 --> 21:09.590
our limitations all day.

21:09.592 --> 21:12.026
So, hopefully we'll find

21:12.028 --> 21:14.498
some enlightenment later.

21:17.133 --> 21:19.132
I have killed.

21:19.134 --> 21:22.036
I've killed lots.

21:22.038 --> 21:24.738
Killed the <i>kaffirs</i>
because I chose to.

21:24.740 --> 21:26.907
Exercised my free will
to do it,

21:26.909 --> 21:28.712
<i>enjoyed</i> it.

21:30.846 --> 21:32.979
So don't you come in here

21:32.981 --> 21:34.515
with your fucking cross

21:34.517 --> 21:36.650
pretending you can love me.

21:36.652 --> 21:39.186
You swear...

21:39.188 --> 21:41.221
too much.

21:41.223 --> 21:43.724
Too right, my bru.

21:43.726 --> 21:45.992
But now I'm inside your head,

21:45.994 --> 21:47.495
staring right back at you

21:47.497 --> 21:50.530
every time you look
in the mirror.

21:50.532 --> 21:51.865
Hatred,

21:51.867 --> 21:54.003
always in you, from now on.

21:56.172 --> 21:58.008
I'm right aren't I, <i>kaffir?</i>

22:02.178 --> 22:05.546
Brutality is the aberration,

22:05.548 --> 22:08.117
Mr. Blomfeld, not love.

22:09.184 --> 22:11.184
Think on that,

22:11.186 --> 22:12.753
no matter...

22:12.755 --> 22:14.991
how uncomfortable
it may make you feel.

22:25.634 --> 22:27.570
[door locks]

22:30.272 --> 22:32.107
[chuckling]

22:40.048 --> 22:41.585
Thank you, Sergeant.

22:48.824 --> 22:49.826
Thank you.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.693
Be careful.

22:53.695 --> 22:55.062
He was security police.

22:55.064 --> 22:57.931
Some of them are.

22:59.602 --> 23:00.604
<i>Amandla.</i>

23:18.287 --> 23:19.756
[Schmidt] I see now
what your plan is.

23:22.625 --> 23:23.790
Fuck you all, Schmidt.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.191
[guard] Open.

23:25.193 --> 23:26.296

23:55.991 --> 23:58.761
[Burly] There goes the holiday
in Namibia se Poes.

24:00.829 --> 24:03.096
You said all the records
was destroyed?

24:03.098 --> 24:05.732
- There was just too much.
- [groans]

24:05.734 --> 24:07.301
Nobody's going
to find out anything

24:07.303 --> 24:09.236
if you just <i>hou jou bek.</i>

24:09.238 --> 24:11.207
And that goes
for you too, Mosi.

24:12.875 --> 24:14.144

24:19.015 --> 24:20.413
Let me sort this out.

24:20.415 --> 24:23.653

24:30.159 --> 24:32.092
[Burly] How is it, Chommie?

24:32.094 --> 24:34.327
Long time no see.

24:34.329 --> 24:35.698
I see you got
some new friends.

24:36.932 --> 24:39.199

24:39.201 --> 24:40.700
Can I help?

24:40.702 --> 24:41.768
Yeah, take him
to the toilet,

24:41.770 --> 24:43.205
looks like
he needs a piss.

24:44.807 --> 24:46.006
Where is the Archbishop?

24:46.008 --> 24:47.874
Why?

24:47.876 --> 24:50.344
Because he's not playing
in the sand.

24:50.346 --> 24:51.647
He's busy.

24:54.115 --> 24:56.249
It's hard work.

24:56.251 --> 24:58.919
You need some sun screen.

24:58.921 --> 25:00.120
You might have a long wait,

25:00.122 --> 25:02.823
the Archbishop
is seeing someone.

25:02.825 --> 25:04.361
Waiting is our game, lady.

25:05.961 --> 25:07.197
Waiting's our game.

<i>there must be something else
you could tell me.</i>

25:23.045 --> 25:26.080
Nobody see her
ever since she go.

25:26.082 --> 25:27.984
Nobody knows nothing.

25:29.984 --> 25:32.052
But Mpho did tell me

25:32.054 --> 25:34.324
that Osiswe was afraid.

25:40.829 --> 25:43.229
So, she was frightened?

25:43.231 --> 25:45.167
I tell her, stay in house.

25:46.268 --> 25:47.468
Mpho tells me,

"I'm not Mamparra,

I'm not live like prisoner."

Father,

Mpho did tell me that Osiswe

26:01.983 --> 26:04.852
was in the mix
of Security Police,

26:04.854 --> 26:09.123
afraid of Operation
Hacksaw or something.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.524
Hacksaw?

26:10.526 --> 26:12.262
Operation Hacksaw?

26:14.195 --> 26:15.197
[Mrs. Morobe] Father,

26:17.165 --> 26:19.232
I'm begging you, Father,

26:19.234 --> 26:22.035
please!

26:22.037 --> 26:25.439
Find me just one piece
of bone

26:25.441 --> 26:27.274
so I can make

26:27.276 --> 26:29.913
a decent burial
for my girl.

26:32.314 --> 26:33.316
I promise,

26:34.482 --> 26:35.484
Mrs. Morobe,

26:37.219 --> 26:39.322
- I promise.
- [Mrs. Morobe] Thank you.

26:40.522 --> 26:43.459
[singing in foreign language]

26:51.933 --> 26:54.101
- [Lavinia] Officer.
- Good morning, Archbishop.

26:54.103 --> 26:55.835
Excuse me, Your Grace.

26:55.837 --> 26:57.069
I just want to ask him
a question.

26:57.071 --> 26:58.271
- It's okay.
- [Burly] Okay.

26:58.273 --> 27:00.073
Can I ask you a question?

27:00.075 --> 27:02.910
It's about loyalty.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.478
Sir,

27:04.480 --> 27:08.215
you served your country
for 30 years,

27:08.217 --> 27:10.584
loyally,

27:10.586 --> 27:12.885
then you witch-hunted.

27:12.887 --> 27:14.955
That's <i>kak,</i> no?

27:14.957 --> 27:17.356
This is not
a witch hunt.

27:17.358 --> 27:19.559
[Varney] Thank you, Officer.

27:19.561 --> 27:23.197
Excuse me, sir,
Your Grace, just...

27:23.199 --> 27:25.065
I was just wondering.

27:25.067 --> 27:27.269
Do you people think
you're better than us?

27:29.571 --> 27:32.506
And the reason I say that
is because,

27:32.508 --> 27:34.307
let's say going forward,

27:34.309 --> 27:36.876
we get a really
<i>kak</i> president

27:36.878 --> 27:38.981
and those are our bodies
buried there.

27:40.583 --> 27:42.248
Will you still be digging us out

27:42.250 --> 27:45.585
and crying about
reconciliation?

27:45.587 --> 27:48.087
I pray we will.

27:48.089 --> 27:49.288
- I believe we will.
- Yeah,

27:49.290 --> 27:51.225
but you can't guarantee it,
can you?

27:51.227 --> 27:53.893
- [Lavinia] Thank you, officer.
- [Burly] Excuse me.

27:53.895 --> 27:55.528
Listen, lady,
I am an officer of the law,

27:55.530 --> 27:57.064
I can ask him what I'd like.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.265
Excuse me, Your Grace,
I'd like to ask you

27:58.267 --> 27:59.469
one more question.

28:01.903 --> 28:04.339
You tell me,
what good is any of this?

28:06.474 --> 28:10.911
What's... What's buried
should stay buried.

28:10.913 --> 28:12.078
The only thing

28:12.080 --> 28:13.881
that will stay buried

28:13.883 --> 28:15.082
is anger

28:15.084 --> 28:17.183
and resentment.

28:17.185 --> 28:19.318
Don't think you don't need us
on your side,

28:19.320 --> 28:20.386
that's all I'm saying.

28:20.388 --> 28:22.322
There are no sides,

28:22.324 --> 28:25.191
we are one nation now.

28:25.193 --> 28:26.162
One nation?

28:28.430 --> 28:30.663
Hell, we're all going to be
covered in gold

28:30.665 --> 28:33.033
at the end of this rainbow.

28:33.035 --> 28:35.401
Good day, officer.

28:35.403 --> 28:37.403
- [speaks foreign language]
- I'm sorry, Your Grace.

28:37.405 --> 28:38.905
It's okay. It's okay.

28:38.907 --> 28:40.574
[Burly]
No, they've got nothing on us...

28:40.576 --> 28:42.142
It's a <i>klomp kak.</i>

28:42.144 --> 28:44.547
We just need to keep quiet,
keep our mouths shut.

28:46.347 --> 28:47.616
Mosi, come.

28:49.417 --> 28:52.354
[singing in foreign language]

29:09.404 --> 29:12.307
[woman speaking
foreign language]

29:22.017 --> 29:23.920
So many secrets.

29:25.153 --> 29:27.653
It's like a cancer.

29:27.655 --> 29:31.525
Is it that evil creature
in Pollsmoor?

29:31.527 --> 29:34.330
Don't let him inside,
you hear me?

29:36.365 --> 29:39.266
If I'm the only person
that he's inside,

29:39.268 --> 29:41.904
then it wouldn't be so bad.

29:44.272 --> 29:47.106
Note to self then,
Archbishop,

29:47.108 --> 29:49.575
don't go back into Pollsmoor.

29:49.577 --> 29:52.379
You hear me?

29:52.381 --> 29:54.180
Vinnie, can you...

29:54.182 --> 29:56.516
can you get Oliver
or one of our researchers

29:56.518 --> 29:58.986
to look and to give me
information

29:58.988 --> 30:02.458
on this secret operation
called "Hacksaw"?

30:04.093 --> 30:05.428
Okay.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.400
[man speaking]

30:28.349 --> 30:29.685
- [man] ...huh?
- Of course, sir.

30:32.788 --> 30:33.990
Huh, do you?

31:19.300 --> 31:23.005
What do you advise me?

31:28.810 --> 31:30.579
[men hooting]

31:33.281 --> 31:34.547
Why Mogomat?

31:34.549 --> 31:36.315
[Mogomat]
Yes, Benjamin's a bitch.

31:36.317 --> 31:38.121
[man]
[speaks foreign language]

31:40.721 --> 31:43.058
[all shouting]

32:18.727 --> 32:20.630
[Benjamin groaning]

32:24.700 --> 32:26.769
[man speaks foreign language]

32:38.881 --> 32:40.083
[man] You a wife.

32:41.650 --> 32:43.749
He's the general's wife.

32:43.751 --> 32:46.688
[laughter]

32:53.528 --> 32:55.629
[Tutu] Please explain to us

32:55.631 --> 32:58.634
the purpose of the SSA.

33:00.736 --> 33:03.539
[Mosi] The SSA, Security police,

33:05.641 --> 33:07.743
its purpose was to extract
information.

33:09.243 --> 33:11.710
We were told
to keep it clean,

33:11.712 --> 33:12.714
but, uh...

33:15.616 --> 33:16.850
[Tutu] Go on,

33:16.852 --> 33:18.584
Mr. Xhosa.

33:18.586 --> 33:22.389
Torture included
the punching of genitals

33:22.391 --> 33:25.324
until blood came, and pus.

33:25.326 --> 33:26.561
[speaks foreign language]

33:28.430 --> 33:31.701
Electric rods in vaginas.

33:38.906 --> 33:39.908
Sorry.

33:43.612 --> 33:45.578
Does the name...

33:45.580 --> 33:47.514
Mpho Morobe

33:47.516 --> 33:49.152
mean anything to you?

33:53.689 --> 33:54.955
No.

33:54.957 --> 33:58.257
[Tutu]
What about operation Hacksaw?

33:58.259 --> 34:00.326
[counsel] Mr. Chairman,

34:00.328 --> 34:02.962
I must interrupt this witness.
I have here

34:02.964 --> 34:05.899
a High Court order
of <i>sub judice</i>

34:05.901 --> 34:07.968
that forbids further testimony
of this witness.

34:07.970 --> 34:10.907
[indistinct chatter]

34:16.612 --> 34:18.547
[laughs]

34:20.449 --> 34:21.679
Really?

34:21.681 --> 34:22.684
Alex.

34:28.824 --> 34:29.824
Colonel,

34:31.659 --> 34:33.458
do you have nothing to say

34:33.460 --> 34:35.762
to these families?

34:35.764 --> 34:38.465
To David Lyon's family

34:38.467 --> 34:39.931
or...

34:39.934 --> 34:42.572
Simba Goniwe's family.

34:44.505 --> 34:47.574
Families who have
had no news

34:47.576 --> 34:50.708
of their beloved son

34:50.710 --> 34:53.780
or their adored husband

34:53.782 --> 34:54.884
for years.

35:00.021 --> 35:02.521
Do you have nothing to say

35:02.523 --> 35:05.327
that would ease their pain?

35:07.929 --> 35:09.929
That might give them...

35:09.931 --> 35:11.798
closure?

35:11.800 --> 35:14.971
I will say only this,
Archbishop,

35:16.038 --> 35:18.637
we were fighting a war

35:18.639 --> 35:20.740
against communism.

35:20.742 --> 35:23.976
I was battling a threat
to us all.

35:23.978 --> 35:25.577
Communist regimes,

35:25.579 --> 35:27.813
harsh, repressive regimes,

35:27.815 --> 35:30.518
intent on making
Africa theirs.

35:36.525 --> 35:37.793
Colonel,

35:40.628 --> 35:42.996
look at the faces

35:42.998 --> 35:45.300
of these families.

35:50.472 --> 35:52.307
They are your own people!

35:54.376 --> 35:56.711
[woman
speaks foreign language]

35:58.012 --> 35:59.882
Colonel, you cannot change

36:02.451 --> 36:04.083
what is over

36:04.085 --> 36:06.655
or where you have been,

36:08.123 --> 36:10.456
but you can change

36:10.458 --> 36:13.028
where you now go.

36:14.862 --> 36:16.595
[counsel] Mr. Chairman,

36:16.597 --> 36:19.065
I have lodged a complaint
with the Public Protector

36:19.067 --> 36:21.501
to have a declaration
that this proceeding

36:21.503 --> 36:24.903
is a politically
motivated slur

36:24.905 --> 36:27.407
against my client's
honor and integrity,

36:27.409 --> 36:29.045
and that of the SADF.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.579
Really, son?

36:35.817 --> 36:37.816
[colonel] This farrago...

36:37.818 --> 36:39.985
is alienating a large sector

36:39.987 --> 36:41.854
of white South Africa.

36:41.856 --> 36:43.889
Now, if that was
your intention,

36:43.891 --> 36:45.557
you have achieved it.

36:45.559 --> 36:47.726
And I do not see
how this furthers the aim

36:47.728 --> 36:51.030
of peace
and reconciliation.

36:51.032 --> 36:54.836
- [scattered applause]
- [all murmuring]

37:09.784 --> 37:11.150
[Tutu] Everyone,

37:11.152 --> 37:14.022
we are taking
a five-minute break, please.

37:26.701 --> 37:28.735
Mrs. Morobe,

37:28.737 --> 37:30.470
Kefilwe,

37:30.472 --> 37:33.472
what are you
still doing here?

37:33.474 --> 37:37.075
We're just sitting.

37:37.077 --> 37:38.744
See,

37:38.746 --> 37:41.046
tomorrow,
Mpho is turning 20.

37:41.048 --> 37:43.119
I have candles to light.

37:44.619 --> 37:46.021
Twenty.

37:47.121 --> 37:49.054
You should go home.

37:49.056 --> 37:51.724
When I get news of Mpho,

37:51.726 --> 37:54.827
I will tell you, I promise.

37:54.829 --> 37:56.563
Oh, she was...

37:56.565 --> 37:58.965
always wanting to study.

37:58.967 --> 38:00.869
Perhaps to be a doctor.

38:02.503 --> 38:04.938
She always saved
for books.

38:04.940 --> 38:06.005
Yes.

38:06.007 --> 38:07.675
Kefilwe knows.

38:13.581 --> 38:15.683
How can I pray for her

38:17.751 --> 38:19.755
if I don't know
what happened?

38:28.996 --> 38:31.666
[dramatic music playing]

38:33.201 --> 38:37.237
[Leah] Good evening.
So how did it go?

38:37.239 --> 38:38.838
[Tutu] Interesting.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.940
Well, I see you won't come in
for your cocoa,

38:40.942 --> 38:42.508
so I come out here.

38:42.510 --> 38:44.943
- [music playing]
- [Tutu] Good night.

38:44.945 --> 38:47.947
[man speaks foreign language]

38:47.949 --> 38:50.249
This music
always reminds me

38:50.251 --> 38:53.489
of President Mandela's
inauguration.

38:54.655 --> 38:55.988
I played it for them.

38:55.990 --> 38:59.291
They wanted to know
about that day.

38:59.293 --> 39:02.195
But how do you convey it,

39:02.197 --> 39:04.831
that sense of freedom?

39:04.833 --> 39:08.267
That, uh,
that first moment,

39:08.269 --> 39:09.802
the taste of it.

39:09.804 --> 39:13.206
That sweet, sweet nectar.

39:13.208 --> 39:16.175
How do you convey it

39:16.177 --> 39:19.012
to someone who was born

39:19.014 --> 39:20.280
into freedom?

39:20.282 --> 39:22.648
You can't. You can't.

39:22.650 --> 39:24.284
Oh, my dear,
drink your cocoa,

39:24.286 --> 39:25.753
it's getting cold.

39:29.023 --> 39:30.092
Remember...

39:31.726 --> 39:33.592
those jets

39:33.594 --> 39:36.095
flying overhead,

39:36.097 --> 39:37.829
streaming smoke

39:37.831 --> 39:41.536
in the colors
of the new national flag

39:42.603 --> 39:43.771
and...

39:45.005 --> 39:48.307
everybody cheering.

39:48.309 --> 39:50.577
Yes. And you dancing

39:50.579 --> 39:52.845
with that
fat white businessman

39:52.847 --> 39:54.182
like two seals.

39:55.617 --> 39:57.316
He wasn't a businessman.

39:57.318 --> 39:59.121
That's what
I was telling them.

40:00.722 --> 40:02.956
He was Nelson Mandela's...

40:02.958 --> 40:06.092
ex-jailer.

40:06.094 --> 40:09.731
And we were dancing
because...

40:11.699 --> 40:14.934
those jets
flying overhead,

40:14.936 --> 40:16.105
they were ours.

40:17.606 --> 40:19.108
Not someone else's.

40:21.610 --> 40:22.845
Ours.

40:24.278 --> 40:25.981
We were free.

40:28.782 --> 40:31.150
I hope we don't let
this slip away.

40:31.152 --> 40:32.288
Oh, no.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.287
[sighs]

40:35.289 --> 40:37.889
And what is it you were really
thinking about out here,

40:37.891 --> 40:40.059
my dear workaholic?

40:40.061 --> 40:41.664
Hmm?

40:43.797 --> 40:46.932
Mrs. Morobe
and her niece

40:46.934 --> 40:49.704
have been waiting
at the Commission

40:51.072 --> 40:53.238
every day this week.

40:53.240 --> 40:56.144
I... promised.

40:58.980 --> 41:00.713
Mpilo,

41:00.715 --> 41:03.849
with your illness,

41:03.851 --> 41:06.019
you know I've had
mixed feelings

41:06.021 --> 41:08.153
about you continuing
the chairmanship.

41:08.155 --> 41:10.356
Huh? What?

41:10.358 --> 41:11.990
Why didn't you
tell me before?

41:11.992 --> 41:14.693
Oh, Desmond Mpilo Tutu,
you are incorrigible.

41:14.695 --> 41:16.996
[laughs]
There's still some life

41:16.998 --> 41:18.865
in this old goat
yet then, huh?

41:18.867 --> 41:21.934
And I know it's important
for Mrs. Morobe,

41:21.936 --> 41:24.103
for all of us,

41:24.105 --> 41:26.304
this Blomfeld man.

41:26.306 --> 41:28.206
Lavinia wants me
to get you to promise

41:28.208 --> 41:29.941
never to see him again.

41:29.943 --> 41:32.110
She says
he's very dangerous.

41:32.112 --> 41:34.780
She showed me
his letter.

41:34.782 --> 41:37.816
God knows
what goes in his head.

41:37.818 --> 41:40.186
He's very clever.

41:40.188 --> 41:42.421
That doesn't mean that
he should get the last word.

41:42.423 --> 41:44.791
Yes, which is exactly why

41:44.793 --> 41:47.226
I asked Varney
to get you his file.

41:47.228 --> 41:48.963
Know your adversary.

41:54.436 --> 41:56.135
You read this?

41:56.137 --> 41:57.640
Twice.

42:05.045 --> 42:07.382
Leah Nomalizo Shenxane.

42:10.452 --> 42:12.084
We've been married so long,

42:12.086 --> 42:14.320
I don't even remember...

42:14.322 --> 42:16.354
how long.

42:16.356 --> 42:18.927
But every day,

42:20.027 --> 42:21.929
you surprise me more...

42:23.097 --> 42:24.400
and more.

42:26.233 --> 42:28.467
Come, come.

42:28.469 --> 42:29.735
Go over to the goat.

42:29.737 --> 42:31.105
[laughs]

42:32.507 --> 42:34.409
Oh. Yes.

You like my wall, Kruger?

44:57.318 --> 44:59.418
[Kruger] Yeah, I like it.

44:59.420 --> 45:01.887
The <i>kaffirs</i>
are up to something.

45:01.889 --> 45:05.124
You should take the <i>kaffirs</i>
down a peg.

45:06.094 --> 45:08.429
You know what
"Paradise Lost" is, Kruger?

45:09.563 --> 45:12.063
A nightclub?

45:12.065 --> 45:15.233
It's a poem,
you clutch plate,

45:15.235 --> 45:16.471
about me.

- [prisoners] No, sir!

46:42.422 --> 46:44.322
[Schmidt] Are there rules here,
you bastards?

46:44.324 --> 46:46.258
[prisoners] Yes, sir!

46:46.260 --> 46:48.126
Whose fucking rules are they?

46:48.128 --> 46:49.195
[prisoners] Yours, sir!

46:49.197 --> 46:50.463
Whose fucking rules are they?

46:50.465 --> 46:51.530
[prisoners] Yours, sir!

46:51.532 --> 46:52.630
Don't you forget it.

46:52.632 --> 46:54.166
[prisoners] No, sir!

46:54.168 --> 46:55.501
[Mogomat] Salute

46:55.503 --> 46:56.735
[prisoners] Salute!

46:56.737 --> 46:58.570

47:52.659 --> 47:53.761
A <i>braai.</i>

47:55.496 --> 47:57.264
Yeah, let's go for a <i>braai.</i>

48:00.735 --> 48:02.834
[sighs] I'll say this

48:02.836 --> 48:05.106

49:20.581 --> 49:22.084
Glutton for it, are we?

49:26.320 --> 49:28.789
So you have whipped that pig de Klerk.

49:30.925 --> 49:32.724
So,

49:32.726 --> 49:35.461
we are living
in Technicolor.

49:35.463 --> 49:38.597
Now they are saying
that it's time for

49:38.599 --> 49:40.599
the rainbow nation

49:40.601 --> 49:41.833
to unite.

49:41.835 --> 49:44.202
That's what they're saying,
is it?

49:44.204 --> 49:45.470
You, white boy in Hout Bay,

49:45.472 --> 49:47.472
with an up and under

49:47.474 --> 49:49.474
Terre Blanche and the AWB.

49:49.476 --> 49:51.376
You Green and Golds, is it?

49:51.378 --> 49:54.345
Shit, man,
that is buffalo dung.

49:54.347 --> 49:56.784
[Tutu] You know,
Mr. Blomfeld,

49:58.286 --> 50:01.954
when I left here last time,

50:01.956 --> 50:04.822
I didn't just even think,

50:04.824 --> 50:08.193
"Well...[laughs]...
that's that.

50:08.195 --> 50:09.396
It's over."

50:10.831 --> 50:12.463
I have fully,

50:12.465 --> 50:15.737
fully investigated
your case.

50:17.405 --> 50:18.406
And?

50:20.507 --> 50:21.710
And...

50:22.976 --> 50:25.913
amnesty for your crimes

50:28.349 --> 50:29.718
is highly unlikely.

50:31.652 --> 50:34.385
You showed your victims

50:34.387 --> 50:35.820
no mercy,

50:35.822 --> 50:39.825
and besides the...

50:39.827 --> 50:41.897
extreme brutality,

50:43.431 --> 50:45.697
your crimes reveal

50:45.699 --> 50:48.903
no political context.

50:53.507 --> 50:55.710
No political context?

50:57.677 --> 50:59.278
My context,

50:59.280 --> 51:00.912
as you call it,

51:00.914 --> 51:04.849
stretches back
some 300 years.

51:04.851 --> 51:07.385
When my ancestors
were farming this land

51:07.387 --> 51:10.021
and building its cities,

51:10.023 --> 51:12.391
yours were creeping out
of the bush,

51:12.393 --> 51:13.827
trying to murder them.

51:15.362 --> 51:16.829
That's context.

51:16.831 --> 51:20.501
My people were murdered
by yours.

51:21.568 --> 51:23.836
In Zimbabwe.
Yes, I know.

51:23.838 --> 51:25.871
Zimbabwe, South Africa?
Same difference.

51:25.873 --> 51:27.740
[Tutu] Is it?
Is it the same?

51:27.742 --> 51:29.541
I don't know.
You're the expert on context.

51:29.543 --> 51:30.711
You tell me.

51:34.782 --> 51:36.949
Your people

51:36.951 --> 51:39.617
[laughs]

51:39.619 --> 51:41.690
believed in this...

51:43.556 --> 51:45.659
this little
subversive book.

51:47.961 --> 51:50.662
It's a beautiful
little book.

51:50.664 --> 51:52.400
It's my favorite,

51:54.402 --> 51:57.068
which teaches us,

51:57.070 --> 51:59.771
"Proclaim liberty

51:59.773 --> 52:02.441
to the captive,

52:02.443 --> 52:05.747
sight to the blind

52:07.447 --> 52:12.786
and to set
the oppressed free."

52:13.920 --> 52:16.890
That's in Luke 4:18.

52:20.027 --> 52:23.028
Your people...

52:23.030 --> 52:25.930
felt they were being
oppressed

52:25.932 --> 52:27.335
by the British,

52:29.603 --> 52:31.769
they fought back

52:31.771 --> 52:33.574
and they became free.

52:35.608 --> 52:38.409
So you need to learn

52:38.411 --> 52:40.912
from your own history

52:40.914 --> 52:43.449
that when a people

52:43.451 --> 52:47.355
decide to be free,

52:48.655 --> 52:52.360
my dear friend,
nothing,

52:53.793 --> 52:57.929
absolutely nothing

52:57.931 --> 53:00.301
is gonna stop them
from becoming free.

53:02.503 --> 53:06.371
[clapping]

53:06.373 --> 53:08.639
Yes. Very good.

53:08.641 --> 53:11.443
Very high-minded of you.

53:11.445 --> 53:14.746
But there's something
you just don't get, <i>kaffir.</i>

53:14.748 --> 53:18.550
Something you just
do not get.

53:18.552 --> 53:21.854
Killing someone
is never political,

53:21.856 --> 53:24.923
no matter what
anyone says.

53:24.925 --> 53:28.028
Killing someone
is personal.

53:30.831 --> 53:33.867
It's always,
always personal.

53:36.670 --> 53:37.972
It's simple.

53:40.641 --> 53:42.974
You like to read, eh?

53:42.976 --> 53:45.778
Study on this,

53:45.780 --> 53:48.514
"Unconquerable will,

53:48.516 --> 53:50.416
study of revenge,

53:50.418 --> 53:52.950
immortal hate,

53:52.952 --> 53:55.653
courage to never submit
or yield,

53:55.655 --> 53:58.460
what else is not
to be overcome?

54:00.059 --> 54:02.059
Better to reign in Hell

54:02.061 --> 54:04.128
than to serve in Heaven."

54:04.130 --> 54:05.833
Lucifer.

54:08.034 --> 54:10.070
You quoted that poem
in your letter.

54:14.608 --> 54:16.809
So papa was a teacher,
so I'm assuming he knows

54:16.811 --> 54:19.381
it's "Paradise Lost."

54:21.181 --> 54:23.048
And if you don't,
you're just one more

54:23.050 --> 54:26.388
half-educated <i>mzee</i>
in my eyes.

54:29.690 --> 54:31.590
You're a dreamer, my old Hotnot.

54:31.592 --> 54:32.990
I grant you that.

54:32.992 --> 54:35.159
A fucking dreamer.

54:35.161 --> 54:36.528
Dreamer?

54:36.530 --> 54:37.565
Yes.

54:39.032 --> 54:42.834
I, for 40 years,

54:42.836 --> 54:45.970
I dreamed of voting...

54:45.972 --> 54:49.240
freely in a free country

54:49.242 --> 54:51.742
in the land of my birth.

54:51.744 --> 54:55.416
For 40 years,
I've been in the wilderness.

54:56.750 --> 55:00.688
Now, it's finally
come to pass.

55:05.559 --> 55:09.628
There was this one
neutralization

55:09.630 --> 55:11.762
and I was standing there
on this <i>stoep</i>

55:11.764 --> 55:15.566
covered in <i>kaffir</i> brain,
and blood, and shit.

55:15.568 --> 55:16.969
My old head was throbbing

55:16.971 --> 55:20.037
<i>like</i> babelaas...

55:20.039 --> 55:22.677
<i>and after the killings,
we set a fire.</i>

55:24.777 --> 55:26.945
And I could hear this voice
inside my head

55:26.947 --> 55:29.947
as clear as you're
hearing me now,

55:29.949 --> 55:33.050
telling me I had no dreams,

55:33.052 --> 55:36.688
no passion, no hope.

55:36.690 --> 55:41.526
"What is life without
them things?" it asked me.

55:41.528 --> 55:44.595
"I have passion, I have dreams."

55:44.597 --> 55:47.532
I remember shouting back.

55:47.534 --> 55:49.534
And all the boys were there,

55:49.536 --> 55:53.070
Francois, Hansie,
all the Hacksaw boys,

55:53.072 --> 55:54.673
<i>they were watching me
through the flames.</i>

55:54.675 --> 55:56.711
<i>The whole time that voice,</i>

55:58.012 --> 56:00.612
"What dreams, what dreams?"

56:00.614 --> 56:02.182
I had dreams!

56:05.085 --> 56:08.287
I had dreams once, I did.

56:08.289 --> 56:12.227
But you fucking people,
you stole them from me.

56:19.132 --> 56:23.101
How... How old...

56:23.103 --> 56:26.938
were you when you
joined the AWB?

56:26.940 --> 56:30.876
What the fuck is that
got to do with anything?

56:30.878 --> 56:34.045
How old?

56:34.047 --> 56:35.250
Seventeen.

56:37.117 --> 56:40.121
And what has it got
you, Mr. Blomfeld,

56:44.224 --> 56:47.992
33 years of hate?

56:47.994 --> 56:50.028
Fuck you.

56:50.030 --> 56:51.597
It's too much for you,
isn't it?

56:51.599 --> 56:52.930
The Commission?

56:52.932 --> 56:55.333
That's plain enough.

56:55.335 --> 56:57.970
I didn't come here
to discuss The Commission.

56:57.972 --> 57:01.238
You can't forgive
the likes of me.

57:01.240 --> 57:04.978
Breaking your faith,
isn't it, eh?

57:06.679 --> 57:09.880
I have watched the light
of life flicker out and die

57:09.882 --> 57:12.217
behind the eyes of so many
I have done.

57:12.219 --> 57:15.623
That is cock-stiffening,
I can tell you.

57:18.925 --> 57:22.663
I have ministered
to the dying,

57:23.998 --> 57:26.934
and I'm no stranger
to death.

57:28.369 --> 57:30.202
First,
when the knife goes in,

57:30.204 --> 57:31.970
they just don't believe it.

57:31.972 --> 57:33.575
They are in shock.

57:35.342 --> 57:37.175
Then is coming acceptance.

57:37.177 --> 57:39.744
Oh, yeah.

57:39.746 --> 57:43.048
They are grateful,
aren't they?

57:43.050 --> 57:45.751
Sometimes I feel
I can almost

57:45.753 --> 57:48.920
hear them whispering,

57:48.922 --> 57:52.257
"Thank you,

57:52.259 --> 57:53.728
thank you."

57:57.664 --> 58:00.264
So don't you come in here
and pontificate,

58:00.266 --> 58:03.367
you self-righteous doff.

58:03.369 --> 58:05.903
TRC has broken you inside,

58:05.905 --> 58:08.940
made the sham of your faith.

58:08.942 --> 58:11.208
I'm right, aren't I?

58:11.210 --> 58:13.045
You can't forgive the beasts

58:13.047 --> 58:16.748
that you confront every day.

58:16.750 --> 58:18.916
[laughs]

58:18.918 --> 58:20.918
That cancer
is eating you alive.

58:20.920 --> 58:22.820
You are so finished, boy.

58:22.822 --> 58:26.691
Don't you call me "boy"
again, Blomfeld.

58:26.693 --> 58:28.096
[Blomfeld] Or what?

58:41.407 --> 58:43.176
Under your mask...

58:47.246 --> 58:50.115
you're riddled

58:50.117 --> 58:51.919
with self-loathing.

59:05.465 --> 59:07.499
[sobs]

59:07.501 --> 59:10.104
Easier to...

59:13.106 --> 59:17.075
to be angry at the world

59:17.077 --> 59:19.447
than to be angry at yourself.

59:21.815 --> 59:23.150
I understand.

59:33.126 --> 59:35.894
When they arrested you,

59:35.896 --> 59:38.166
you had this on you.

59:42.503 --> 59:44.869
You hung onto it

59:44.871 --> 59:47.942
for 40 years.

59:49.342 --> 59:50.478
Why?

01:00:01.255 --> 01:00:02.423
Visit's over.

01:00:05.025 --> 01:00:06.193
What happened?

01:00:08.427 --> 01:00:10.394
And don't hide behind

01:00:10.396 --> 01:00:14.000
Aristotle, or Plato,
or Milton.

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:18.068
You're right,

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:20.938
you're right.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:24.108
I have to stare in the mirror

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:28.014
at myself every day,

01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:33.453
and so do you.

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.356
And you're not... you're not...

01:00:38.358 --> 01:00:41.559
you're not a fallen angel

01:00:41.561 --> 01:00:43.830
and I'm not God.

01:00:44.965 --> 01:00:48.469
We're both just men.

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:55.943
One question...

01:00:58.978 --> 01:01:00.945
what do you know

01:01:00.947 --> 01:01:05.353
about this Operation Hacksaw?

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.263
I said, visit's over, <i>kaffir.</i>

01:01:22.936 --> 01:01:25.103
You are locked inside

01:01:25.105 --> 01:01:27.340
two prisons, Blomfeld.

01:01:29.009 --> 01:01:32.209
One is made of concrete

01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:35.447
and barbed wire.

01:01:35.449 --> 01:01:38.617
The other one

01:01:38.619 --> 01:01:41.151
is worse

01:01:41.153 --> 01:01:44.358
because it's there
in your head.

01:01:47.594 --> 01:01:51.532
"The mind in its own place,

01:01:52.666 --> 01:01:55.233
and in itself,

01:01:55.235 --> 01:01:58.135
can make a heaven of hell,

01:01:58.137 --> 01:02:01.909
or a hell of heaven."

01:02:05.978 --> 01:02:07.380
That's Milton.

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:11.449
So, if you're going
to read him,

01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:12.650
don't cherry-pick.

01:02:12.652 --> 01:02:16.990
You must read him properly.

01:02:32.572 --> 01:02:34.472
What the fuck is that?

01:02:34.474 --> 01:02:38.412
That is your way out
of prison.

01:02:40.179 --> 01:02:44.581
That could be a way out

01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:48.355
of your personal hell.

01:02:58.331 --> 01:03:00.067
[sighs]

01:03:04.036 --> 01:03:08.141
Come out, Blomfeld.

01:03:10.043 --> 01:03:11.345
Come out.

01:03:12.411 --> 01:03:14.214
Don't stay there.

01:03:16.682 --> 01:03:18.985
God is waiting for you.

01:03:20.753 --> 01:03:22.456
Come out.

01:03:48.081 --> 01:03:50.483
[Tutu] <i>He quoted Milton at me.</i>

01:03:53.152 --> 01:03:55.055
I lost my temper.

01:04:01.661 --> 01:04:07.264
But he knows about Hacksaw,

01:04:07.266 --> 01:04:09.601
and whatever Hacksaw is,

01:04:09.603 --> 01:04:13.507
it is linked to the death
of Mpho Morobe.

01:04:26.585 --> 01:04:29.153
[metal clanging]

01:04:29.155 --> 01:04:30.623
[Schmidt] Blomfeld.

01:04:37.496 --> 01:04:39.530
I'm thinking I go
get me a beer

01:04:39.532 --> 01:04:42.133
when the shift is done.

01:04:42.135 --> 01:04:46.107
Maybe a sweet piece
of hundred-rand ass.

01:04:51.143 --> 01:04:52.776
Come on, bru,

01:04:52.778 --> 01:04:56.146
what the fuck is it between
you and that <i>kaffir?</i>

01:04:56.148 --> 01:04:58.383
Thinking you can sell out
and save your neck

01:04:58.385 --> 01:04:59.787
like the other braks?

01:05:01.454 --> 01:05:02.789
[Blomfeld speaking]

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.260
What the <i>kaffir</i> gets
from me is medicine

01:05:09.262 --> 01:05:11.695
I choose to give him,
you fucking <i>poes.</i>

01:05:11.697 --> 01:05:13.331
And understand this,

01:05:13.333 --> 01:05:16.501
nobody uses the word
informer about me.

01:05:16.503 --> 01:05:19.106
[grunts]

01:05:22.409 --> 01:05:24.045
[Blomfeld] Fuck off, Francois.

01:05:26.512 --> 01:05:29.583
[laughing]

01:05:33.719 --> 01:05:36.688
[Tutu] <i>I find it impossible
to believe,</i>

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:39.657
<i>President de Klerk,
that the involvement</i>

01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:42.659
<i>of at least
one cabinet minister</i>

01:05:42.661 --> 01:05:45.362
<i>and two police commissioners,</i>

01:05:45.364 --> 01:05:48.133
<i>in human rights violations
represents</i>

01:05:48.135 --> 01:05:51.869
<i>nothing more than aberrations
by mavericks,</i>

01:05:51.871 --> 01:05:54.838
<i>but many state-sponsored
killings</i>

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.840
<i>have been known to happen</i>

01:05:56.842 --> 01:05:58.275
<i>and the state has brought</i>

01:05:58.277 --> 01:06:01.481
<i>no senior ministers to justice.</i>

01:06:08.454 --> 01:06:11.491
What are you up to,
you fucking <i>kaffir?</i>

01:06:25.237 --> 01:06:27.804
Ha! No way,
my weaselly little <i>kaffir.</i>

01:06:27.806 --> 01:06:30.710
No way is that shit
going to work.

01:06:42.655 --> 01:06:46.594
[children shouting]

01:07:00.907 --> 01:07:03.273
[Kefilwe] Hello, Father.

01:07:03.275 --> 01:07:05.543
Aunty got very sick.

01:07:05.545 --> 01:07:07.581
Now I don't know what to do.

01:07:11.284 --> 01:07:12.950
What is antimony, father?

01:07:12.952 --> 01:07:15.753
Antimony, some such thing,
doctors said.

01:07:15.755 --> 01:07:17.892
It's a poison,
I'm afraid,

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:20.326
it's a poison.

01:07:26.565 --> 01:07:28.234
You must not give up.

01:07:29.635 --> 01:07:30.570
[Tutu continues]

01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:37.811
[woman speaking]

01:07:47.487 --> 01:07:48.987
What can you do?

01:07:48.989 --> 01:07:50.925
One man alone.

01:07:52.659 --> 01:07:54.528
I have a lead.

01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:57.764
I'm hopeful about it.

01:07:58.965 --> 01:08:01.566
So, please,

01:08:01.568 --> 01:08:03.333
don't give up hope

01:08:03.335 --> 01:08:05.471
and we will not
give up on you.

01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:08.972
I did wrong.

01:08:08.974 --> 01:08:10.510
[Tutu speaking]

01:08:13.847 --> 01:08:17.783
You made a little mistake,

01:08:19.653 --> 01:08:21.322
a little one.

01:08:28.694 --> 01:08:30.594
Sorry, Your Grace,

01:08:30.595 --> 01:08:33.063
there is nothing I can do,
really.

01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:34.631
If your name isn't on here,

01:08:34.634 --> 01:08:37.035
you don't go in,
no matter who you are.

01:08:37.037 --> 01:08:38.669
[Tutu] This is crazy.

01:08:38.671 --> 01:08:40.506
Get me the governor.

01:08:48.881 --> 01:08:52.317
Governor, it's imperative
that I see Mr. Blomfeld.

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:54.551
[Governor] <i>Your Grace,
I have been overruled</i>

01:08:54.554 --> 01:08:56.653
<i>by the Department
of Correctional Services</i>

01:08:56.654 --> 01:08:57.921
<i>and there is simply nothing</i>

01:08:57.923 --> 01:09:00.023
- <i>I can do about it.</i>
- I see.

01:09:00.024 --> 01:09:01.725
[Governor]
<i>Good day, Your Grace.</i>

01:09:01.728 --> 01:09:03.363
[hangs up; dial tone]

01:09:04.863 --> 01:09:06.366
Good day.

01:09:12.037 --> 01:09:13.840
Wasted journey, huh?

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.773
No,

01:09:16.774 --> 01:09:17.810
I got to see you.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.881
Good day.

01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:24.982
Howard,
we need to contact

01:09:24.984 --> 01:09:27.953
the Department of Correctional
Services immediately.

01:09:31.591 --> 01:09:33.390
[Varney] I'm sorry to be
the bearer of bad news, Arch.

01:09:33.393 --> 01:09:35.593
Inkatha have issued a statement

01:09:35.595 --> 01:09:36.796
to the press.

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:39.964
It says that
the commission's findings

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:42.500
are failing
to investigate impartially,

01:09:42.502 --> 01:09:44.468
- that we're ANC stooges.
- What?

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:45.870
On what grounds?

01:09:45.872 --> 01:09:47.604
[Varney] That there is
no rational connection

01:09:47.606 --> 01:09:48.740
between evidence given

01:09:48.742 --> 01:09:50.140
and conclusions we draw.

01:09:50.143 --> 01:09:51.808
Don't they realize
the damage

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:53.611
they are doing?

01:09:53.613 --> 01:09:55.713
To all of us!

01:09:55.715 --> 01:09:58.485
To... To--To their own...

01:09:59.685 --> 01:10:01.954
people.

01:10:06.658 --> 01:10:10.061
[phone ringing]

01:10:10.063 --> 01:10:12.763
[Lavinia] Excuse me. Can I
have you attention. please?

01:10:12.765 --> 01:10:14.699
There has been a bomb threat
against the commission

01:10:14.701 --> 01:10:16.768
and I'm afraid
the police have told us

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.936
we have to cancel
today's session.

01:10:18.938 --> 01:10:20.871
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can, all right?

01:10:20.873 --> 01:10:23.441
Alex, the Archbishop
would love a word.

01:10:23.443 --> 01:10:25.576
Please go gently on him.

01:10:25.578 --> 01:10:27.144
I've never seen him so down.

01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:29.983
I'll get back
to you soonest.

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.851
[indistinct chatter]

01:10:33.853 --> 01:10:36.019
[Alex] Bish?

01:10:36.021 --> 01:10:38.156
Bomb threat?
Good God. What's next?

01:10:38.158 --> 01:10:39.656
[Tutu] What next?

01:10:39.658 --> 01:10:41.659
What next?

01:10:41.661 --> 01:10:43.460
Inkatha has made

01:10:43.462 --> 01:10:46.430
a public attack

01:10:46.432 --> 01:10:48.098
on the integrity

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.768
of President Mandela himself.

01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:52.637
[Alex] That's all we need.

01:10:52.639 --> 01:10:53.974
Tribalism.

01:10:56.943 --> 01:10:58.045
Bish,

01:10:59.679 --> 01:11:01.678
this whole enterprise

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.482
is in danger of collapsing,

01:11:04.484 --> 01:11:05.619
isn't it?

01:11:06.819 --> 01:11:09.756
[dramatic music playing]

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:13.827
I don't know, Alex.

01:11:16.628 --> 01:11:17.965
You tell me.

01:11:21.701 --> 01:11:24.872
I just don't know.

01:11:35.515 --> 01:11:37.514
[Tutu] My God,

01:11:37.516 --> 01:11:39.853
why are you silent to me?

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.657
Show me a sign, please?

01:11:56.735 --> 01:11:57.871
[Leah] Mpilo.

01:12:02.942 --> 01:12:04.040
Oh, my darling.

01:12:04.042 --> 01:12:06.979
[Tutu sobbing]

01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:12.118
[gulls calling]

01:12:13.953 --> 01:12:16.053
[Tutu]
Remember that time,

01:12:16.055 --> 01:12:17.821
the kids wanted
to play on this beach

01:12:17.823 --> 01:12:20.760
but it was whites only?

01:12:22.127 --> 01:12:24.728
[Leah] Uh, they wanted
to swim so badly

01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:26.964
but the look
on their faces,

01:12:26.966 --> 01:12:29.232
I was so angry.

01:12:29.234 --> 01:12:32.702
[Tutu] Yes,
and humiliated.

01:12:32.704 --> 01:12:34.173
I felt that way

01:12:35.841 --> 01:12:37.575
the other day
at Pollsmoor.

01:12:37.577 --> 01:12:39.977
[Leah] I see,

01:12:39.979 --> 01:12:42.112
Pollsmoor.

01:12:42.114 --> 01:12:45.916
Reminded me
of when I was a small boy,

01:12:45.918 --> 01:12:48.188
walking to school
with my father,

01:12:49.788 --> 01:12:52.658
crossing that white area,

01:12:53.792 --> 01:12:56.326
watching my father's face

01:12:56.328 --> 01:13:00.733
as he had to show
his pass to police

01:13:02.001 --> 01:13:04.268
and them yelling at him

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:06.870
and call him names.

01:13:06.872 --> 01:13:09.809
And he endured it all
for my sake.

01:13:11.743 --> 01:13:14.144
I just... I just...

01:13:14.146 --> 01:13:16.149
I just stood there.

01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:21.018
I couldn't take away

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.756
his humiliation.

01:13:25.992 --> 01:13:29.162
I... I failed him.

01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:33.066
Leah, I failed him.

01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:37.168
Maybe that lost soul

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:38.369
in Pollsmoor

01:13:38.371 --> 01:13:39.706
is right.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.175
Maybe I'm just...

01:13:45.011 --> 01:13:48.782
an... an--an old fraud...

01:13:51.117 --> 01:13:54.050
delusional, and...

01:13:54.052 --> 01:13:55.055
and...

01:13:57.222 --> 01:13:59.123
- unworthy.
- Oh,

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:01.726
Mpilo, you're crazy.

01:14:01.728 --> 01:14:02.793
No.

01:14:02.795 --> 01:14:05.662
So what are you
talking about?

01:14:05.664 --> 01:14:07.397
You've spent
a lifetime

01:14:07.399 --> 01:14:10.067
defending the dignity
of others.

01:14:10.069 --> 01:14:12.937
Never to give up, never.

01:14:12.939 --> 01:14:15.071
You're not going
to give up now.

01:14:15.073 --> 01:14:18.144
Absolutely not.
[laughing]

01:14:21.747 --> 01:14:25.849
Yes. [laughs]

01:14:25.851 --> 01:14:28.588
So much hate over what?

01:14:30.288 --> 01:14:32.356
Over what, huh?

01:14:32.358 --> 01:14:37.093
- A pigment of our imagination.
- [Leah] Ah.

01:14:37.095 --> 01:14:41.298
Mr. Pollsmoor's completely
underestimated you,

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.769
completely.

01:14:46.171 --> 01:14:49.108

for not showing the world

in charge, God?"

But then,

01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:23.893

01:27:23.895 --> 01:27:26.095
that that was His way

Then, if you have the balls,

it'll teach you
that the only person

you can change is yourself.

This one's a just-in-case,

01:33:03.534 --> 01:33:05.003
if you know what I mean.

01:33:06.371 --> 01:33:08.838
Will you post
that one personally,

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.275
outside the prison?

01:33:12.409 --> 01:33:14.777
[Jansen] Yes,

01:33:14.779 --> 01:33:17.312
we will move you
to the high security corridor.

01:33:17.314 --> 01:33:19.949
You will be safe there.

01:33:19.951 --> 01:33:22.485
Safe? Yes.

01:33:22.487 --> 01:33:23.989
Safe it is.

01:33:26.824 --> 01:33:28.958
[Mrs. Van den Bergh] <i>Mr. Varney.</i>

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.192
Mr. Varney.

01:33:30.194 --> 01:33:33.028
[dog barks]

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:35.430
You forgot the press clippings.

01:33:35.432 --> 01:33:36.900
- [Varney] Thank you.
- There is something

01:33:36.902 --> 01:33:38.369
that I haven't told you.

01:33:39.904 --> 01:33:41.571
After it was over,

01:33:41.573 --> 01:33:42.839
the shooting,

01:33:42.841 --> 01:33:44.440
you have
to understand one thing,

01:33:44.442 --> 01:33:47.910
Rian Blomfeld, Piet's father,
was a bigoted monster.

01:33:47.912 --> 01:33:49.445
After it was over,

01:33:49.447 --> 01:33:52.147
he beat Piet up so badly,

01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:54.884
he broke his arm.

01:33:54.886 --> 01:33:56.820
And then the family
moved to Zimbabwe

01:33:56.822 --> 01:33:59.923
and they sent Piet
to a white boarding school.

01:33:59.925 --> 01:34:01.924
He was just ten years old.

01:34:01.926 --> 01:34:03.358
He was away

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.094
when the family
was wiped out.

01:34:06.096 --> 01:34:07.996
Revenge, people thought.

01:34:07.998 --> 01:34:10.301
And he blames himself
for all of it.

01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:15.905
I hope you can help Piet,

01:34:15.907 --> 01:34:16.973
can you?

01:34:16.975 --> 01:34:18.911
I hope so.

01:34:20.177 --> 01:34:21.844
Goodbye Mrs. Van den Bergh

01:34:21.846 --> 01:34:23.215

to see him then,

Who?

01:34:54.212 --> 01:34:55.644

He's coming to see Blomfeld.

01:35:00.618 --> 01:35:03.988
He got the department
to overrule the governor.

01:35:05.289 --> 01:35:07.193
Blomfeld is fucking with me.

01:35:12.963 --> 01:35:14.899
What is it
with you and Blomfeld?

01:35:18.203 --> 01:35:20.840
We were in the same
hit squad together.

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:24.173
He got arrested,

01:35:24.175 --> 01:35:26.910
I went undercover.

01:35:26.912 --> 01:35:30.013

we go back,

gave us orders.

he sinks me.

[Kruger] Fuck.

01:35:53.337 --> 01:35:55.938
I never took him for a canary.

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.340
You know, the governor's
got him on J-Wing.

01:35:58.342 --> 01:35:59.942
Yeah?

01:35:59.944 --> 01:36:03.248
Well, that won't
fucking save him.

What are you
gonna do, Sergeant?

01:36:07.085 --> 01:36:09.986
I'm gonna put the shit
heap on lockdown.

But I do not want
my daughter's death

01:47:27.064 --> 01:47:29.164
and death

01:47:29.166 --> 01:47:32.067

01:48:53.384 --> 01:48:55.319
[Hansi sobbing continues]

01:49:11.969 --> 01:49:15.373
[sobbing]

01:49:37.328 --> 01:49:40.265
[dramatic music playing]

01:49:51.876 --> 01:49:53.811
[phone ringing]

01:49:56.113 --> 01:49:58.246
[Tutu] Benjamin.

01:49:58.248 --> 01:50:00.315
Good to meet you.

01:50:00.317 --> 01:50:01.784
Do you know why
you're here?

01:50:01.786 --> 01:50:04.385
Something about
the Blomfeld?

01:50:04.387 --> 01:50:07.257
Yes, something about
the Blomfeld.

01:50:09.159 --> 01:50:10.491
Governor?

01:50:10.493 --> 01:50:11.794
Hello, Benjamin.

01:50:11.796 --> 01:50:12.861
Yes, sir.

01:50:12.863 --> 01:50:13.928
How are you?

01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:15.065
I'm good, sir.

01:50:16.233 --> 01:50:18.000
Don't worry.

01:50:18.002 --> 01:50:19.300
The department
will transfer you

01:50:19.302 --> 01:50:20.869
out of this prison

01:50:20.871 --> 01:50:22.437
but before that,

01:50:22.439 --> 01:50:23.504
I'm going to read you

01:50:23.506 --> 01:50:25.139
the last will and testament

01:50:25.141 --> 01:50:26.344
of Piet Blomfeld.

01:50:31.015 --> 01:50:33.949
"All I have
are a few bits of junk,

01:50:33.951 --> 01:50:35.517
except for my copy
of the poem

01:50:35.519 --> 01:50:37.820
<i>'Paradise Lost...'"</i>

01:50:37.822 --> 01:50:38.887
[Blomfeld]
<i>...which is to be given</i>

01:50:38.889 --> 01:50:41.190
<i>to Benjamin Mboweni.</i>

01:50:41.192 --> 01:50:42.456
<i>There is a little money of mine</i>

01:50:42.458 --> 01:50:44.826
<i>in the Witwatersrand Bank.</i>

01:50:44.828 --> 01:50:47.295
<i>That money
I leave to you, Benjamin,</i>

01:50:47.297 --> 01:50:49.430
<i>for your use.</i>

01:50:49.432 --> 01:50:50.499
<i>Understand, Benjamin,</i>

01:50:50.501 --> 01:50:53.268
<i>it is not an apology</i>

01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:56.004
<i>but it is a reparation</i>

01:50:56.006 --> 01:50:57.606
<i>to free you from the results</i>

01:50:57.608 --> 01:50:58.874
<i>of what has been done</i>

01:50:58.876 --> 01:51:00.278
<i>to your people.</i>

01:51:12.555 --> 01:51:15.793
[Linda] Oh,
I wanted to talk to you.

01:51:17.228 --> 01:51:18.559
[Tutu] Sit down.

01:51:18.561 --> 01:51:19.797
[Linda] Okay.

01:51:25.368 --> 01:51:28.637
I've come to thank you.

01:51:28.639 --> 01:51:32.007
You know, for what
you've been doing,

01:51:32.009 --> 01:51:33.875
shining a light

01:51:33.877 --> 01:51:35.479
into a dark place.

01:51:37.314 --> 01:51:41.316
You are a brave woman,

01:51:41.318 --> 01:51:44.085
Mrs. Coetzee.

01:51:44.087 --> 01:51:47.955
I hated you at first.

01:51:47.957 --> 01:51:50.025
[chuckles]

01:51:50.027 --> 01:51:51.326
Of course.

01:51:51.328 --> 01:51:53.094
I'm just as easy to hate

01:51:53.096 --> 01:51:54.599
as I am to love.

01:51:56.166 --> 01:51:59.166
Well, I just...
I guess I just...

01:51:59.168 --> 01:52:00.537
I lived in a bubble.

01:52:02.273 --> 01:52:04.373
But now I ask myself,

01:52:04.375 --> 01:52:06.508
"How could I not see?"

01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:08.677
I'm not talking
just about Hansi.

01:52:08.679 --> 01:52:10.611
I guess I'm really
talking about

01:52:10.613 --> 01:52:13.415
everything that's been
going on.

01:52:13.417 --> 01:52:17.184
I pretended that
it wasn't happening, but...

01:52:17.186 --> 01:52:21.156
I knew.

01:52:21.158 --> 01:52:22.691
And at this point,

01:52:22.693 --> 01:52:24.996
probably doesn't
mean much, but...

01:52:27.163 --> 01:52:30.300
I want to say I'm sorry.

01:52:32.302 --> 01:52:34.635
Why doesn't it mean much

01:52:34.637 --> 01:52:37.408
to say you're sorry?

01:52:39.143 --> 01:52:41.276
I guess because I think that

01:52:41.278 --> 01:52:43.611
I'm a bad person

01:52:43.613 --> 01:52:46.250
and that you'll think
these are just white tears.

01:52:49.019 --> 01:52:52.720
Happily, tears,

01:52:52.722 --> 01:52:54.524
they don't have any color

01:52:56.193 --> 01:52:59.561
and I think you're a person

01:52:59.563 --> 01:53:01.996
in need of a hug

01:53:01.998 --> 01:53:04.568
just like the rest of us.

01:54:05.628 --> 01:54:07.294
[Leah] What was that for?

01:54:07.296 --> 01:54:09.296
[Tutu] I'm sorry.

01:54:09.298 --> 01:54:10.732
These last two years
have been

01:54:10.734 --> 01:54:12.366
hard for you, Leah.

01:54:12.368 --> 01:54:13.501
But I just want you
to know

01:54:13.503 --> 01:54:15.202
I never took you
for granted.

01:54:15.204 --> 01:54:16.470
Never.

01:54:16.472 --> 01:54:19.074
[Leah] Why, you old goat,

01:54:19.076 --> 01:54:21.543
are you asking me
for forgiveness?

01:54:21.545 --> 01:54:22.643
[Tutu]
I suppose I am.

01:54:22.645 --> 01:54:23.812
[Leah laughs]

01:54:23.814 --> 01:54:25.379
[Tutu] Look at it.

01:54:25.381 --> 01:54:27.281
What a beautiful sight.

01:54:27.283 --> 01:54:30.285
[Leah] Yes, the sea
and all its colors.

01:54:30.287 --> 01:54:31.519
I've always loved them.

01:54:31.521 --> 01:54:32.720
[Tutu] No, no, no, I mean,

01:54:32.722 --> 01:54:36.391
here on the beach.

01:54:36.393 --> 01:54:38.360
Our beach.

01:54:38.362 --> 01:54:39.428
[Leah laughs]

01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:42.367
