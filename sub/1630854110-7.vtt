00:04.308 --> 00:06.310
<i>Dr. Ben Song
risked everything</i>

00:06.310 --> 00:08.747
<i>when he used
the Quantum Leap Accelerator</i>

00:08.747 --> 00:10.575
<i>to travel back in time.</i>

00:10.575 --> 00:13.448
<i>Now our team's working
to find out why.</i>

00:13.448 --> 00:17.147
<i>As he leaps between bodies
with no memory of who he is,</i>

00:17.147 --> 00:19.149
<i>he still has one hope--</i>

00:19.149 --> 00:21.238
<i>that his next leap...</i>

00:21.238 --> 00:23.632
<i>takes him back...</i>

00:23.632 --> 00:27.810
<i>to the place
and people he calls home.</i>

00:43.217 --> 00:45.045
Trick or treat.

00:46.916 --> 00:49.484
Father Davenport, thank God.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.486
I'm afraid it's gotten worse.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.749
Please, come in.

01:02.627 --> 01:05.369
Thank you for traveling
all the way from Baltimore.

01:05.369 --> 01:09.156
We tried a local priest, but...

01:09.156 --> 01:11.462
he didn't have your reputation.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.075
I'm Lola, Daisy's mother.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.512
Our maid, Magda.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.818
Everyone else is in the parlor.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.091
Boo.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.354
Mm.

01:33.354 --> 01:35.095
Happy Halloween.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.009
Nice costume.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.795
This way, please, Father.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.101
OK.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.450
Not a costume.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.106
Welcome.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.717
Charles, Daisy's father.

01:48.717 --> 01:51.850
And this is my brother, Percival.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.156
Percy's fine.

01:53.156 --> 01:55.115
Only Aunt Tessa
calls me Percival.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.334
Put that drink down, Percival.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.770
For goodness' sake.

01:58.770 --> 02:02.078
You are in the presence
of a man of faith.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.340
Contessa Gray.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.820
Welcome to my home.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.431
I'm sorry you have
to visit it under such

02:07.431 --> 02:09.607
unfavorable circumstances.
- Mm.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.870
Ziggy says that there
is an 89% chance that

02:11.870 --> 02:14.917
you are here to perform
an exorcism.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.179
What?

02:16.179 --> 02:17.572
That cannot be right.

02:17.572 --> 02:18.660
Sorry?

02:20.227 --> 02:24.579
What is the condition
of the afflicted?

02:27.756 --> 02:31.281
Probably best you see
for yourself.

02:31.281 --> 02:34.197
Before I begin,
it's been a long journey.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.633
Do you have a restroom--

02:35.633 --> 02:38.984
- Water closet.
- Water closet I can use?

02:38.984 --> 02:40.334
Exorcism?

02:40.334 --> 02:42.771
Yes. Hey,
keep your voice down.

02:42.771 --> 02:45.208
All right,
in the original history,

02:45.208 --> 02:47.254
Father James Davenport attempted

02:47.254 --> 02:49.212
an exorcism on Daisy Gray.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.127
After what
"The Covington Gazette"

02:51.127 --> 02:54.783
described as a "holy battle,"
the priest failed.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.786
Daisy died six minutes
after midnight.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.049
That's what you're
here to change.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.660
But exorcisms aren't real.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.575
And even if they were,
I'm not religious.

03:04.575 --> 03:05.837
I don't believe in possession.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.230
Ben, you are
literally possessing

03:07.230 --> 03:09.189
that guy's body right now.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.192
OK.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.759
Fair point.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.415
Look, I don't know if
the demon is real or not.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.417
But what I do know
is that the machine

03:20.417 --> 03:22.332
sent you here for a reason.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.465
So let's just go
through the motions

03:24.465 --> 03:27.250
until we figure out why.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.991
- Fine.
- Thank you.

03:28.991 --> 03:32.255
But spoiler alert,
the demon's not real.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.563
Mm-mm-mm.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.262
It started three weeks ago.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.308
She began to speak in riddles.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.049
Her strength has doubled, unnaturally.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.443
She can't remember things
she's said or done.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.361
What's that smell?

03:51.361 --> 03:54.234
It's the rotting stench
of the demon.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.278
Ready?

04:03.417 --> 04:06.724
She won't let Magda
clean that off.

04:06.724 --> 04:09.379
We tried restraining
her with rope,

04:09.379 --> 04:12.077
but she chewed
right through it.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.165
Daisy did this?

04:13.165 --> 04:14.166
No.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.909
It was the demon.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.440
Mother?

04:27.441 --> 04:29.399
It's all right, honey.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.358
Father Davenport is here now.

04:35.666 --> 04:39.453
It's an angel sent here
to save me.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.719
How is this gonna go?

04:45.850 --> 04:47.330
Is--

04:47.330 --> 04:50.333
is a question
you may have.

04:51.465 --> 04:54.032
Three steps.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.599
Step one--

04:55.599 --> 04:57.993
You command the demon
to reveal itself.

05:00.038 --> 05:04.608
I command the demon
to reveal itself.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.610
The exorcist
and the demon fight

05:06.610 --> 05:08.177
for the soul of the possessed.

05:08.177 --> 05:14.488
The exorcist, that's me,
and the demon, she,

05:14.488 --> 05:16.359
fight for the soul
of the possessed.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.665
And three--

05:17.665 --> 05:20.320
The demon leaves,
if the exorcist wins.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.453
The last priest didn't make
it past the first step.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.847
I'll wait downstairs.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.375
Now what?

05:32.375 --> 05:34.290
Step one.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.987
Try the book.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.512
Hey, at least you get to
use your high school Latin.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.342
It's bookmarked. How kind.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.483
- Uh...
- What just happened?

05:53.483 --> 05:54.919
Not sure.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.486
Some sort of glitch.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.445
Just keep going.

05:58.445 --> 05:59.489
You're doing great.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.201
Wait. No. Um--

06:24.209 --> 06:25.515
What the--

06:28.213 --> 06:30.868
Oh, hell no.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.447
Hey, there is
some sort of glitch.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.623
The system just kicked me out.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.062
Uh, Ian?

06:51.062 --> 06:52.412
Over here.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.417
Hey, I--

06:57.417 --> 06:59.419
are you wearing cat ears?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.290
What? I--I keep them
in my desk,

07:01.290 --> 07:02.465
in case of e-meow-gencies.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.510
OK.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.946
Well, speaking of emergencies,

07:04.946 --> 07:08.602
Ben is stuck in 1934,
mid-exorcism, alone.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.125
Yeah.
Something is interfering

07:10.125 --> 07:11.866
with the signal
in the imaging chamber.

07:11.866 --> 07:14.216
I mean, we can still track
his location and his vitals.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.566
I just can't hear or see him
for some reason.

07:16.566 --> 07:17.785
- Why?
- I can only speculate,

07:17.785 --> 07:20.222
but maybe it was the demon.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.832
- Ian.
- What? What?

07:21.832 --> 07:25.488
Something supernatural
is not entirely impossible.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.491
Sam Beckett believed
that God was guiding

07:28.491 --> 07:29.927
the Quantum Accelerator.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.581
So maybe a demon really
is trying to interfere.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.496
OK. Well, Ben has six hours

07:33.496 --> 07:35.106
until Daisy dies.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.978
How long until we get
this thing back online?

07:36.978 --> 07:39.067
I mean, I don't even
understand what's happening.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.461
So just let me run
some diagnostics

07:41.461 --> 07:43.114
and then we'll go from there.

07:51.166 --> 07:54.604
Addison?

07:55.779 --> 07:57.651
Father, the doctor's here.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.304
It's a great time
for the doctor to come in.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.741
You can--he may enter.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.967
Dr. Felix Watts.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.233
I'd like to administer
a sedative.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.321
Yes, please.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.410
What have you got for me?

08:18.410 --> 08:20.412
Oh, for her.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.197
Yes. Absolutely.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.546
Good call.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.722
So I take it you're
not a believer?

08:25.722 --> 08:27.507
The patient is suffering,
and the family's

08:27.507 --> 08:28.856
denying her medical treatment

08:28.856 --> 08:30.597
because of their
religious misgivings.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.469
- Yeah.
- You're a part of the problem.

08:33.469 --> 08:34.688
No offense.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.081
None taken.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.344
I would love to find
a rational explanation

08:39.344 --> 08:41.869
for what's happening here.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.740
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.655
Well, the rational
explanation is that this

08:45.655 --> 08:47.222
is an illness of the mind.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.006
She needs cutting-edge
medical intervention,

08:49.006 --> 08:50.834
electroshock therapy,
for instance,

08:50.834 --> 08:53.707
or perhaps a lobotomy.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.325
Will you let me
undo her bindings,

09:03.325 --> 09:04.369
let her sleep in comfort?

09:04.369 --> 09:06.850
Is that safe?

09:08.156 --> 09:10.985
There's no demon here,
father, only a girl of 18.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.248
She couldn't do much
even if she wanted to.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.685
Joan of Arc was
only 17 when she led

09:15.685 --> 09:18.253
the French army to victory.

09:21.691 --> 09:25.390
There's a Cathedral in France,
in Orleans,

09:25.390 --> 09:28.219
where Joan of Arc went
to pray before battle.

09:28.219 --> 09:31.048
Auntie Tessa took me there
when I was little.

09:31.048 --> 09:35.575
Daisy, Dr. Watts believes
there's a logical explanation

09:35.575 --> 09:36.663
to what's happening here.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.229
Don't worry, father.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.710
I know the demon is real.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.191
This is a battle of faith.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.020
When my father lost his job
at the motorcar company

09:46.020 --> 09:49.763
on account of the Depression,
he stopped going to church.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.287
Then my mother stopped,
because we lost our house

09:52.287 --> 09:54.332
and had to move in
with Auntie Tessa.

09:54.332 --> 09:57.988
Mother says this house
gives her the creeps.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.034
I can't disagree
with her there.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.383
Hmm.

10:02.210 --> 10:06.518
That's how it started,
about three weeks ago,

10:06.518 --> 10:08.782
just after my 18th birthday.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.827
The wallpaper moved.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.787
I began to see terrible things.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.354
My father said God turned
his back on us.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.835
He was wrong.

10:18.835 --> 10:21.751
God sent an angel
to help Joan win her battle.

10:21.751 --> 10:25.233
And God sent you to help me.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.889
The Book of Revelation says,

10:28.889 --> 10:32.675
"Fear none of those things
which thou shalt suffer.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.982
Be thou faithful unto death."

10:36.592 --> 10:40.770
And Father, I intend
to be faithful unto death.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.218
How is she?

10:56.351 --> 10:57.787
Sleeping.

10:57.787 --> 11:00.921
She's a young woman
of remarkable faith.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.836
She's a fighter.

11:02.836 --> 11:06.666
Reminds me of someone
I used to know.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.102
She looks just like you.

11:08.102 --> 11:11.192
Inherited my sense
of conviction too.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.889
Thank you, Father.
- For what? I--

11:12.889 --> 11:15.675
For coming here.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.678
You are the answer
to our prayers.

11:29.863 --> 11:32.169
Something to
lighten the mood?

11:32.169 --> 11:33.649
Can I tempt you?

11:33.649 --> 11:36.173
I better not.
Long night ahead.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.567
You know what that
does to your liver?

11:38.567 --> 11:40.830
I'm more concerned
for my soul than my liver.

11:45.182 --> 11:48.011
I'll leave this here just
in case you change your mind.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.904
Just something I used
to sing to Daisy

12:10.904 --> 12:12.688
when she cried as a baby.

12:12.688 --> 12:13.820
It's lovely.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.391
You have a nice voice.

12:20.391 --> 12:25.222
Oh, I trained a little
when I was Daisy's age.

12:25.222 --> 12:29.792
Wanted to go to Hollywood,
be the next Gloria Swanson.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.753
But then, I got pregnant
with Daisy.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.972
Do you think it's my fault?

12:35.972 --> 12:38.018
- What?
- The demon.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.368
We were young
when I got pregnant.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.326
Charles and I
weren't married yet.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.720
Is it--

12:44.720 --> 12:46.591
is it punishment?

12:49.246 --> 12:52.597
18 years and 9 months
seems a little long

12:52.597 --> 12:55.905
for God to wait before
doling out punishment.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.752
It's locked.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.320
Open this door!

13:33.464 --> 13:35.336
Mother?

13:35.336 --> 13:37.120
Are you hurt?

13:37.120 --> 13:39.340
Who took off her restraints?

13:42.169 --> 13:43.997
What's all the commotion?

13:46.956 --> 13:48.915
Where's Aunt Tessa?

13:56.531 --> 13:57.837
Dear God.

14:10.675 --> 14:13.678
There must be a rational explanation.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.246
I'm struggling
to conjure one.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.595
Come on.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.858
You're supposed to be
the man of science.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.468
What do you think
happened three weeks ago?

14:20.468 --> 14:21.817
What?

14:21.817 --> 14:23.384
Daisy's symptoms
began three weeks ago,

14:23.384 --> 14:25.429
right after her birthday?

14:25.429 --> 14:27.257
I'm not sure.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.911
It could explain
her symptoms.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.391
If it's an illness
of the mind--

14:30.391 --> 14:32.610
No illness of the mind
could've doubled her strength.

14:32.610 --> 14:35.526
There is no manner in which
Daisy could've lifted

14:35.526 --> 14:37.572
Contessa Gray's body
onto that armoire.

14:37.572 --> 14:41.837
Doctor, are you starting
to believe?

14:43.752 --> 14:46.711
In medical school, we studied
the words of Hippocrates.

14:46.711 --> 14:49.062
"To know is science.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.325
To believe one knows
is ignorance."

14:51.325 --> 14:54.850
I'm afraid this has gone beyond
the realm of what I know.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.157
When I was in school,
I was taught

14:57.157 --> 15:00.812
to examine all the variables
before drawing conclusions.

15:00.812 --> 15:03.206
The Vatican teaches that?

15:03.206 --> 15:06.035
Yes.

15:06.035 --> 15:10.039
I have to consider every
possible explanation.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.870
This family is counting
on me to help them.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.263
<i>Daisy's counting on me.</i>

15:16.263 --> 15:17.394
Let's go, folks.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.266
Move along.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.007
Nothing to see here.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.448
Ah.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.972
Jen says no other departments
are having issues,

15:29.972 --> 15:32.061
that the interference isolated
to the imaging chamber,

15:32.061 --> 15:33.758
which makes no sense.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.110
What was that?

15:37.110 --> 15:38.241
Nothing. I'm just-- I'm--

15:38.241 --> 15:39.590
I'm monitoring Ben's vitals.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.809
He's fine.
Every--everyone's fine.

15:40.809 --> 15:43.768
We're all fine.
- Ian?

15:43.768 --> 15:45.553
OK. So he's freaking out
a little bit.

15:45.553 --> 15:46.989
God.
I feel so useless.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.338
Is there anything else
that we could be doing?

15:48.338 --> 15:50.775
I'm running every single
diagnostic that I can.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.343
I literally have two separate
teams trying to mount

15:53.343 --> 15:55.780
two different workarounds.
- But?

15:55.780 --> 15:58.783
But you might wanna
start preparing yourself

15:58.783 --> 16:01.221
for the possibility
that you won't get

16:01.221 --> 16:03.266
back in there Before 12:06.

16:03.266 --> 16:06.182
Now, in--in the meantime,
I figured that Reddit might

16:06.182 --> 16:08.576
be able to offer us some
insight in what's going on

16:08.576 --> 16:10.186
in Ben's current timeline.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.797
Oh, my God.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.930
Daisy killed Great Aunt Tessa?
- Yeah.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.063
WebCrawlers19 said
that according

16:17.063 --> 16:19.195
to the constable's report,
Contessa Gray was found

16:19.195 --> 16:20.849
dead on top of an armoire.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.938
Now, Daisy was
the only one alone

16:22.938 --> 16:24.592
with her at the time of death.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.811
There is no way that she
could lift up that body.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.509
I gotta get back in there.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.554
You have to figure
this out, Ian.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.557
I'll figure it out.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.994
OK.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.004
I knew you'd come around.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.008
Never been a gin guy.
- Hmm.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.618
Still not.

16:50.618 --> 16:53.621
Hey, what's with all
the encyclopedias?

16:53.621 --> 16:56.319
I sell them, door-to-door.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.278
Charles says it's an
excuse to screw around

16:58.278 --> 17:01.194
with lonely housewives all day,
to which I say,

17:01.194 --> 17:05.502
I'm a salesman
and a public servant.

17:05.502 --> 17:08.157
Hey, what happened
three weeks ago?

17:08.157 --> 17:10.725
I notice Charles didn't
wanna talk about it.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.771
Are you a priest
or a constable?

17:13.771 --> 17:16.296
I need any information
that can help Daisy.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.169
Don't know how it could
help with the exorcism,

17:20.169 --> 17:23.216
but the night
of Daisy's birthday,

17:23.216 --> 17:25.870
Charles and Aunt Tessa got
into an argument about money.

17:25.870 --> 17:29.570
And I won't have you relying
on my inheritance either.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.572
I said I don't
want her money!

17:33.095 --> 17:35.489
See, I'm used to screwing up.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.230
Charles isn't.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.710
He married the pretty girl,
got the good job.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.408
Then, he lost that job.

17:41.408 --> 17:44.324
And let's just say,

17:44.324 --> 17:48.241
lately, he's been wrathful.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.373
So the demon is my fault?

17:52.723 --> 17:55.813
And whose fault is it we
lost our life savings?

17:55.813 --> 17:57.467
Hey.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.208
It was an investment, OK?

17:59.208 --> 18:00.688
Who knew the market
would crash?

18:00.688 --> 18:02.342
You told me it was foolproof.

18:02.342 --> 18:03.995
You lied to get to my money.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.910
And greed is a sin
as much as wrath.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.564
So now the demon
is my fault too?

18:07.564 --> 18:08.913
OK.
All right.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.915
Why don't we just both
take a beat, you know,

18:10.915 --> 18:12.700
say a few Hail Marys?

18:12.700 --> 18:14.310
I beg your pardon.

18:14.310 --> 18:17.661
Daisy is unwell again.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.143
- I'll see to her.
- No.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.841
Mrs. Gray is
requesting you, Father.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.154
She was starting to calm
down after the... incident.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.504
So I gave her dinner,
some soup.

18:34.504 --> 18:35.592
That's all she can stomach.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.420
Then--

18:41.685 --> 18:44.340
Maybe it's best if--

18:48.257 --> 18:51.739
I stood upon
the sand of the sea

18:51.739 --> 18:54.263
and saw a beast rise up,

18:54.263 --> 18:58.311
and upon his head the name
of "blasphemy."

19:00.008 --> 19:01.879
- What?
- And there appeared an angel

19:01.879 --> 19:05.187
unto him from heaven,
strengthening him.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.451
And immediately
there fell from his eyes

19:08.451 --> 19:12.151
as it had been scales.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.979
For we walk by
faith and not by sight.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.720
Daisy, I don't
know what's going on,

19:16.720 --> 19:18.809
but the demon isn't real.

19:21.899 --> 19:26.208
The end
is nigh for you, traveler.

19:30.778 --> 19:31.953
Are you all right, Father?

19:31.953 --> 19:33.476
I heard you cry out.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.871
Get the doctor!

19:38.351 --> 19:39.656
What's happening?

20:26.660 --> 20:28.444
Daisy?

20:28.444 --> 20:30.490
Daisy, are you OK?

20:31.795 --> 20:33.928
Of course you're not.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.646
Are you feeling
all right, Father?

20:56.646 --> 20:58.866
Much better, now that I
found the source of the smell.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.607
Look, demon stench.

21:00.607 --> 21:01.999
Someone's lying.

21:01.999 --> 21:04.437
I just need to figure out
who put this there.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.657
That would be me.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.183
Yes, I put the fish
under Daisy's bed.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.491
To fool us into thinking
the demon is real?

21:15.491 --> 21:16.623
Fool you?

21:16.623 --> 21:18.799
The demon is real.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.409
We call it dybbuk
in my culture.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.889
It's a part
of Jewish tradition.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.544
The fish protects
from the dybbuk.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.154
Daisy's father
would never allow me

21:26.154 --> 21:27.416
to hang that in her room.

21:27.416 --> 21:28.896
So I snuck one in.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.898
Real fish is more potent.

21:30.898 --> 21:32.247
Oh, it's potent all right.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.597
Gives new meaning
to the term "red herring."

21:34.597 --> 21:36.773
So you had nothing to do
with Aunt Tessa's death?

21:36.773 --> 21:38.688
I liked Ms. Contessa.

21:38.688 --> 21:41.517
After the market crash,
she let me keep my job.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.650
She doesn't spend a penny
on herself anymore,

21:43.650 --> 21:45.173
saves her money for charity.

21:45.173 --> 21:48.002
Would anyone else have
any reason to harm her?

21:48.002 --> 21:49.612
No.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.048
She had money.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.094
But she made it very clear
in her new will

21:53.094 --> 21:54.748
that Daisy would
inherit everything

21:54.748 --> 21:56.140
after her 18th birthday.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.316
So Daisy now stands
to inherit

21:57.316 --> 21:58.621
a great deal of wealth.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.667
Daisy would never hurt
her auntie on purpose.

22:00.667 --> 22:03.496
It was the dybbuk, the demon.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.152
I didn't wanna do it.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.939
I never wanted to get married.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.375
- Really?
- Mm.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.291
I mean, I'm sure my parents
loved each other once.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.771
But by the time
they got divorced,

22:17.771 --> 22:19.860
they couldn't even be in
the same room together.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.427
So I made a choice.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.994
That was never
gonna be my life.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.954
And then I met Ben.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.259
Yeah.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.783
Well, what are you gonna do?

22:29.783 --> 22:31.306
He's very lovable.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.482
What if he never
makes it back?

22:35.179 --> 22:36.964
Those leaps are getting
harder and harder.

22:36.964 --> 22:41.142
And he might get stuck in time,

22:41.142 --> 22:43.449
and I'll never see him again.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.928
You know, in quantum physics,

22:44.928 --> 22:47.801
there's this concept that
if you believe in something,

22:47.801 --> 22:49.150
it helps make it true.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.760
At least that's
what Ian told me

22:50.760 --> 22:52.632
when they tried to get me to
make a vision board with them.

22:52.632 --> 22:55.069
Oh, yeah.
I passed on that too.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.812
But I think maybe
they were right.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.162
It's OK to be worried.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.817
It's OK to be confused,

23:03.817 --> 23:06.080
angry sometimes.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.084
But we are gonna
bring Ben back.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.912
I know it.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.435
I see it.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.220
I won't settle
for anything less.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.922
So your advice is
to make a Ben vision board?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.710
My advice is
to not lose hope.

23:29.146 --> 23:31.540
I believe in you.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.020
I believe in us.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.717
We're gonna solve this thing.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.286
Just gotta have a little faith.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.820
Addison.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.128
You there?

23:56.173 --> 23:58.349
It was worth a shot.

23:58.349 --> 24:01.440
I could really use someone
to talk to right now.

24:03.137 --> 24:06.488
I guess you'll have to do.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.882
So...

24:08.882 --> 24:11.319
uh...

24:11.319 --> 24:15.236
I've tried to find
a scientific explanation.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.499
And I can't.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.547
I know it seems crazy,
but I think I might have

24:21.547 --> 24:24.593
to actually try and perform
an exorcism?

24:26.116 --> 24:27.857
But I don't believe in--

24:29.293 --> 24:32.340
I mean, I can read Latin, but...

24:32.340 --> 24:34.211
I'm not a man of faith.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.870
I'm--I'm not.

24:43.307 --> 24:46.136
But you are.

24:46.136 --> 24:49.444
So maybe, just this once,
I put my need

24:49.444 --> 24:53.100
to rationally and logically
explain everything away

24:53.100 --> 24:56.451
and I try and be open
to something

24:56.451 --> 24:58.932
I don't truly understand.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.345
Here we go.

25:42.105 --> 25:46.370
Step one, I command
the demon to reveal itself.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.629
Okay.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.529
Hey, you.

26:58.529 --> 27:01.750
<i>♪ Somewhere beyond the sea</i>

27:01.750 --> 27:03.752
Addison?

27:03.752 --> 27:07.930
<i>♪ Somewhere waiting for me</i>

27:07.930 --> 27:09.497
Come here.

27:09.497 --> 27:12.935
<i>♪ My lover stands
on golden sands ♪</i>

27:12.935 --> 27:14.633
Where am I?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.417
You're right here.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.463
How is this possible?

27:19.463 --> 27:25.426
<i>♪ Somewhere beyond the sea</i>

27:25.426 --> 27:26.557
I love you.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.168
Mm-mm.

27:28.168 --> 27:29.952
This isn't real. No.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.693
My Addison's a hologram.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.608
And I know I haven't left home.

27:33.608 --> 27:34.827
So--oh, no.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.350
Am I dead?

27:37.786 --> 27:39.832
You don't feel dead.

27:39.832 --> 27:42.269
I'm hallucinating.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.487
How?

27:43.487 --> 27:44.663
Why?

27:50.712 --> 27:52.932
The gin.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.281
They drugged me.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.588
And Daisy too.

27:57.588 --> 27:59.373
That is not great.

27:59.373 --> 28:00.591
It--it is.

28:00.591 --> 28:01.897
It is great.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.030
It means there's finally
a scientific explanation

28:04.030 --> 28:06.119
for what's been happening,

28:06.119 --> 28:08.382
which means someone
in the family

28:08.382 --> 28:11.602
is a psychopathic murderer.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.648
<i>The five variables
I didn't consider.</i>

28:13.648 --> 28:16.433
Someone killed Aunt Tessa
and framed the demon.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.740
And At 12:06,
they're gonna kill Daisy too.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.915
But who?

28:22.265 --> 28:23.266
Huh.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.747
The devoted maid is suspicious.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.881
She tried to save Daisy
with that gross dead fish.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.099
That's right.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.274
The grieving mother?

28:31.274 --> 28:32.319
She couldn't have killed her.

28:32.319 --> 28:33.842
She was by the piano, with you.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.670
Hmm. The skeptical doctor.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.324
It was his idea to take
off the restraints.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.978
Come on, Ben. No motive.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.675
That just leaves
the angry father

28:40.675 --> 28:42.111
and his jealous brother.

28:42.111 --> 28:44.766
Magda did say something
about a new will.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.377
One of the brothers gets
the money if Daisy dies.

28:47.377 --> 28:50.076
Yeah. But how did they kill
Aunt Tessa?

28:50.076 --> 28:51.555
No one was in the room
with Daisy,

28:51.555 --> 28:52.992
and the door was locked.

28:54.384 --> 28:58.780
Well, it is one of
those creepy old mansions.

28:58.780 --> 29:01.304
Those usually have--

29:01.304 --> 29:03.567
Secret passageways.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.092
There's a hidden door
in the bedroom.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.397
There must be.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.052
Yeah.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.935
It's almost midnight.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.023
You have to go.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.154
Mm-mm.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.678
I wanna stay here with you.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.811
I know.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.552
But this isn't real.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.523
Hang on, Daisy.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.083
I knew it.

30:31.873 --> 30:34.615
Father, how did it go?

30:36.878 --> 30:39.272
There's been some progress.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.404
Oh, wonderful.

30:42.753 --> 30:45.408
I asked Magda to bring up
some soup for Daisy.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.019
Is this good timing?

30:47.019 --> 30:48.281
Sure is.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.239
I'm just gonna make
a quick call.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.762
Excuse me.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.904
911 hasn't been invented yet.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.297
It's dead.

31:04.297 --> 31:05.820
The line's been dead
since you arrived.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.909
It was the demon.
- Forget the demon.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.911
I need you to tell me
about the new will.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.348
What happened the night
of Daisy's birthday?

31:12.348 --> 31:15.612
Well, there was an argument.

31:15.612 --> 31:18.572
I don't understand
why you can't

31:18.572 --> 31:21.096
become a salesman
like Percival.

31:21.096 --> 31:24.970
Can't keep living in the past,
sitting around all day

31:24.970 --> 31:27.494
feeling sorry for yourself.

31:27.494 --> 31:30.453
And I won't have you relying
on my inheritance either.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.238
I am not one
of your charity cases.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.630
Charles, please.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.807
I said I don't
want her money!

31:38.635 --> 31:42.248
Well, then, I'll make sure
you don't get a penny.

31:53.476 --> 31:54.825
She cut Charles out?

31:54.825 --> 31:57.306
Are you saying Mr. Charles
is the killer?

31:57.306 --> 31:58.699
He has been so angry.

31:58.699 --> 32:00.353
No, the killer is the one
who is going to get

32:00.353 --> 32:01.876
the money if Daisy dies.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.660
The next in line,
now that Charles is out,

32:03.660 --> 32:07.055
the one whose bedroom,
I assume,

32:07.055 --> 32:09.014
is next to Daisy's.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.841
That would be Mr. Percy.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.234
There's your demon.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.846
He dosed me with something.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.634
This would be so much easier
if we had the internet.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.157
The what?

32:22.157 --> 32:24.855
Encyclopedias,
the original internet.

32:24.855 --> 32:27.119
Magda, has Mr. Percy
requested you pick anything

32:27.119 --> 32:28.642
strange up for him recently,
some odd,

32:28.642 --> 32:30.774
out of the ordinary purchase?
- Yes.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.341
He had me drive an hour
out of town

32:32.341 --> 32:33.821
to visit a horticulturist
friend of his,

32:33.821 --> 32:35.170
said he wanted some new plants
for the garden.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.345
What were they?

32:36.345 --> 32:38.391
I--I don't remember.

32:38.391 --> 32:39.827
They were white.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.568
It started with a J?

32:43.744 --> 32:44.788
Jim Something.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.138
Jim. Jim. Jim.

32:46.138 --> 32:47.356
Jim something.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.010
Jim, Jim, Jim.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.581
Jimsonweed.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.887
"Plant, also known
as devil's snare.

32:56.887 --> 32:59.412
"Can cause fever, amnesia,
and vivid hallucinations.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.544
Over time, it can be--"
- Fatal.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.416
Uncle Percy did his homework.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.505
He's been dosing Daisy's soup
since her birthday,

33:05.505 --> 33:08.203
and he's going to deliver
the final dose in six minutes.

33:08.203 --> 33:11.032
If you're right, I'm the one
who's been poisoning her.

33:11.032 --> 33:14.253
If I'm right, you'll be
the one who helps me save her.

33:20.433 --> 33:23.914
Uncle Percy didn't
kill Auntie Tessa.

33:23.914 --> 33:25.568
I can't believe that.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.918
The Great Depression was--

33:27.918 --> 33:31.444
is a scary time for people.

33:31.444 --> 33:35.404
And fear makes us
do crazy things.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.406
No.

33:37.406 --> 33:39.060
The demon did it.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.367
You taught me
something today.

33:41.367 --> 33:44.500
Sometimes we need to step
outside what we believe

33:44.500 --> 33:47.373
to see things
for what they are.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.160
But if the demon isn't real, then...

33:52.160 --> 33:55.294
my uncle is a murderer.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.078
I think I prefer the demon.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.083
We still need ironclad proof.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.042
But I have an idea.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.609
We'll need the doctor's help.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.046
Are you game?

34:10.570 --> 34:11.614
Yeah.

34:27.195 --> 34:30.285
May the love and the grace
of the Holy Spirit

34:30.285 --> 34:33.941
be with you now and move you
on to the everlasting life

34:33.941 --> 34:36.248
of the love
of the Father of God,

34:36.248 --> 34:38.467
and the everlasting
Holy Spirit.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.645
No!

34:44.299 --> 34:47.476
Time Of Death, 12:06.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.701
They'll be here soon
to take the body.

34:55.745 --> 34:59.619
Will you join us in a prayer
for the departed, Constable?

35:04.885 --> 35:06.539
Let us pray.

35:08.715 --> 35:11.805
In the name of the Father
and of the Son

35:11.805 --> 35:13.807
and of the Holy Spirit--

35:16.070 --> 35:17.985
Do you hear that?

35:20.161 --> 35:22.729
- What?
- The Holy Spirit.

35:26.472 --> 35:27.647
Where?

35:27.647 --> 35:28.909
It brings us a message.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.998
Well? What's it say?

35:30.998 --> 35:34.828
Shh. It says the demon
is still here.

35:38.962 --> 35:41.661
Do you remember the three steps
of an exorcism?

35:41.661 --> 35:46.056
Step one, I command
the demon to reveal itself!

35:56.110 --> 35:57.764
Impossible.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.766
I felt no pulse.

35:59.766 --> 36:03.335
Step two, we fight for
the soul of the possessed.

36:03.335 --> 36:06.033
What do you want, demon?

36:06.033 --> 36:10.429
Someone here killed Daisy.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.524
Oh, God.

36:18.524 --> 36:19.916
No!

36:19.916 --> 36:21.527
Please, don't hurt me!

36:21.527 --> 36:22.528
Don't possess me!

36:22.528 --> 36:24.530
You killed Aunt Tessa!
Confess.

36:24.530 --> 36:25.618
I confess.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.097
You poisoned Daisy
with jimsonweed.

36:27.097 --> 36:28.403
I confess.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.840
And you did it
for the inheritance.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.059
No.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.234
I did it for Lola.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.149
Ye--wait. What?

36:35.149 --> 36:37.673
- Percy?
- The demon is real, Lola.

36:37.673 --> 36:40.067
What the hell
is going on here?

36:40.067 --> 36:41.547
Percival, you idiot.

36:41.547 --> 36:44.637
We were gonna run away
together, Lola and me,

36:44.637 --> 36:46.378
when I got the inheritance money.

36:46.378 --> 36:48.423
I'm in love with her.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.991
She said she wanted
to go to Hollywood.

36:50.991 --> 36:53.820
You're a hell of an actress,
I'll give you that.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.648
Oh, shut up, Charles.

36:55.648 --> 36:59.347
I've never had anything
on my terms.

36:59.347 --> 37:03.221
The child I had to have,
the man I had to marry.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.702
Getting the chance
at my dream again,

37:06.702 --> 37:09.227
that was something
worth believing in!

37:11.794 --> 37:13.753
Forgive us, Father.

37:13.753 --> 37:17.278
I'm sorry, but I do
not have that authority.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.859
I forgive you.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.601
Oh, thank you.

37:35.601 --> 37:36.776
Thank you.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.604
Daisy?

37:38.604 --> 37:40.693
Is-- is that you?

37:42.956 --> 37:47.308
You... forgive me?

37:47.308 --> 37:50.529
After everything I-- I did?

37:50.529 --> 37:52.008
How?

37:53.880 --> 37:56.230
It's just what I believe in.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.888
Yeah, well,
she can forgive you

38:01.888 --> 38:06.196
all she wants,
but you're still going to jail.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.851
Step three, the demon leaves.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.160
The exorcist wins.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.522
Oh, my God.

38:27.522 --> 38:29.045
Look.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.830
What? I don't see anything.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.614
Exactly, the posts
about Daisy's possession

38:32.614 --> 38:35.835
disappeared, which means--

38:35.835 --> 38:37.315
Ben did it?

38:37.315 --> 38:38.794
Ben did it.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.405
Whoo!

38:40.405 --> 38:41.841
One step closer
to making it home.

38:41.841 --> 38:44.104
Oh, that is the power
of believing, baby.

38:44.104 --> 38:47.412
I'm starting a new vision
board tonight, first thing.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.807
Oh, no.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.026
What is it?

38:53.026 --> 38:54.027
Wait. No, no, no.

38:54.027 --> 38:55.855
That-- no, that can't--

38:55.855 --> 38:57.204
how?

38:57.204 --> 38:58.945
Ian, you're scaring me.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.512
I just figured out where
the interference

39:00.512 --> 39:02.688
in the imaging chamber
is coming from.

39:02.688 --> 39:06.605
I wanted to thank you
for helping me see things

39:06.605 --> 39:08.868
from a different perspective.

39:08.868 --> 39:11.305
You too, Joan of Arc.

39:12.741 --> 39:15.614
I decided I'm gonna donate
the inheritance money.

39:15.614 --> 39:17.224
There's a small charity nearby.

39:17.224 --> 39:20.009
They give people jobs.

39:20.009 --> 39:21.663
I'd like to help them grow.

39:23.186 --> 39:24.927
Auntie Tessa
would've liked that.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.974
What's the charity called?

39:27.974 --> 39:30.237
It's called Goodwill.

39:31.717 --> 39:33.196
Yeah.

39:33.196 --> 39:35.547
I have a feeling
it'll really take off.

39:35.547 --> 39:38.898
You know, I still
believe God sent you here.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.856
I may have had
devil's snare in my system,

39:40.856 --> 39:43.468
but when I first looked
at you, Father,

39:43.468 --> 39:46.558
I saw an angel looking back.

39:48.647 --> 39:52.955
He looked younger than you
with black hair and dark eyes.

39:52.955 --> 39:54.043
Wait.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.958
You're leaving now,
aren't you?

39:58.787 --> 40:00.833
To Baltimore?

40:00.833 --> 40:02.095
Oh.

40:02.095 --> 40:03.183
Yeah.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.185
Right.

40:05.185 --> 40:06.839
Have a safe trip.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.422
Ben, can you hear me?

40:24.422 --> 40:25.901
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

40:27.468 --> 40:28.904
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

40:28.904 --> 40:30.558
<i>I have been trying
to reach you all day.</i>

40:30.558 --> 40:32.778
<i>I had to cut off the signal
to Quantum Leap Headquarters</i>

40:32.778 --> 40:34.475
<i>so they wouldn't interfere.</i>

40:34.475 --> 40:36.564
<i>My name is Janis Calavicci.</i>

40:36.564 --> 40:37.957
<i>You don't remember me.</i>

40:37.957 --> 40:40.133
<i>But I'm here to warn you
that--</i>

40:40.133 --> 40:41.874
<i>No. No.</i>

40:41.874 --> 40:43.876
<i>Ben! Ben!</i>

40:43.876 --> 40:45.312
<i>No! No!</i>

40:47.532 --> 40:49.403
Ben, come on.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.318
Ben?

40:51.318 --> 40:52.493
You know me?

40:52.493 --> 40:54.321
It's now or never, new guy.

40:54.321 --> 40:55.801
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.154
