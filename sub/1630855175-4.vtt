00:18.352 --> 00:20.604
No! Daddy, don't! Stop it!

00:20.604 --> 00:23.148
- Listen, I'm gonna call you, all right?
- Where are you going? Dad.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.525
Who wants an early allowance?

00:24.525 --> 00:28.487
Look at you, Father of the Year.
Where should I send the plaque?

00:28.487 --> 00:30.447
Send it to that whore's house.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.533
- I got it, Mommy. Here...
- Don't let him take anything!

00:32.533 --> 00:33.951
...let me help you with your bags.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.160
Peggy, don't!

00:36.995 --> 00:37.955
Come on!

00:38.539 --> 00:39.790
Good girl, Peggy.

00:39.790 --> 00:40.916
I should say hi.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.752
This should be good.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.379
- Peggy.
- Hey, whore!

00:45.963 --> 00:48.924
Peggy, stop it. Peggy! Goddamn it.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.760
Yeah! Smash that car!

00:52.803 --> 00:56.723
Hey! You sure you don't wanna come inside,
say hello to your best friend?

00:56.723 --> 00:57.808
I never called her that.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.394
Dianne, go up to Mommy's bathroom
and get her douchebag.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.397
- A whore needs her tools.
- Peggy, back off. Come on.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.566
Are those my mother's fucking pearls?

01:07.109 --> 01:10.279
- You said these were your mother's.
- How could you give her Mommy's pearls?

01:10.279 --> 01:11.989
It's like a contest with you two.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.448
- Who's worse?
- Can we please go?

01:13.448 --> 01:15.075
- Take them off! Take them off!
- Oh, my God.

01:15.075 --> 01:15.993
Peggy.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.452
- Get off me.
- Take them off. Take--

01:17.452 --> 01:19.079
- Take them off!
- Peggy. Peggy, let go.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.330
- Peggy. Goddamn it!
- Fuck!

01:20.330 --> 01:22.583
- Let go of me.
- Take them off!

01:22.583 --> 01:23.584
Peggy, let go!

01:23.584 --> 01:26.378
Get off me. Fuck off!

01:26.378 --> 01:28.755
- Let go. Let go, you little punk.
- Let go!

01:38.807 --> 01:40.017
I'm never getting married.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.770
What can I say? He was exciting.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.569
Let's find enough to make a bracelet.

01:50.569 --> 01:51.778
You can have it when I die.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.865
You're not dying.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.202
She is,
when I push her in front of a train.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.163
Can you push them both?

02:44.540 --> 02:46.500
Wow! There she is.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.752
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:48.752 --> 02:49.920
Early release.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.506
The state fucked up their case
on a technicality.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.633
Take off my mother's kimono. Let's go.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.219
Wow, Peg, you look great.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.929
All right, time to go.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.222
Can I just finish my doppio?

03:00.222 --> 03:03.517
I haven't had real coffee in,
like, what, 18 months?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.227
And whose fault is that?

03:07.104 --> 03:09.523
Peg, I don't want to be the guy
to say it, right?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.650
'Cause that's not my style.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.778
But one of us took the rap,
and it wasn't you.

03:14.778 --> 03:18.115
But that was ten years ago,
and you've been back in twice since.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.825
Yeah, well,
I should have represented myself.

03:19.825 --> 03:20.909
Here we go.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.953
Hey, they botched
both those fricking cases.

03:22.953 --> 03:23.871
You know what?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.873
You did, what, a half a semester

03:25.873 --> 03:28.000
- of law school at Queens College?
- Anyway--

03:28.000 --> 03:30.836
- And then you flunked out.
- Yeah, exams are a racket.

03:31.420 --> 03:35.507
Now, can I have an espresso
and wash my clothes, please?

03:40.095 --> 03:41.221
These are good beans.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.225
This is what I missed.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.687
You know, the cars out there,
they're different. It's weird.

03:48.687 --> 03:52.232
You don't think things are gonna change
that fast, but they do.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.194
- When I walked in here today--
- When you broke in.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.778
Rosalyn's things all around me.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.989
You chased my sister
out of our mother's house.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.908
The closet even smells like her.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.701
Stay off of her clothes, Denny.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.702
Come on.

04:03.702 --> 04:07.331
- You put your smell on top of hers.
- No, I didn't. I just got the kimono.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.791
But you can't miss that fragrance.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.959
You know? It's Rosalyn.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.921
Her being is still in the fabric.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
You break into my house.

04:17.298 --> 04:21.220
You slime around my mother's albums.
You're waltzing around in her kimono.

04:21.220 --> 04:24.473
- You don't respect boundaries.
- Peg, these are still damp.

04:24.473 --> 04:29.019
What did I say last time? We're done.
You're a detriment to my life.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.355
And number two,
sign the fucking divorce papers.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.399
Why don't you give me a ride to the motel?

04:35.317 --> 04:36.944
I got 200 in gate money.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.695
I can buy you dinner.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.451
I just had chicken cacciatore
with three sides.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.704
Wow. Your stuck-on-an-island meal.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.123
And it's not even your birthday.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.836
- No, there's just bureaucracy and shit.
- Right, right.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.088
And so I'm taking these PI classes.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.047
- Thank you.
- Sure, hon.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.882
You know, they're just a formality

04:58.882 --> 05:01.134
because, really,
Bruce has already given me cases.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.262
I'm already bringing in work.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.806
I mean, I'm pretty much indispensable.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.101
- Wow, Peg. Look at you.
- Right?

05:09.101 --> 05:11.019
- Look at you.
- I know.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.564
You're a fucking phoenix, baby.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.525
Don't call me "baby." I'm not your baby.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.236
I'm sorry, I apologize.

05:19.236 --> 05:23.282
Listen, I'm coming from a place
of learning now.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.950
I'm sorry.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.370
Look, here's the thing. Here it is.
We're both phoenixes.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.707
You, with Rosalyn gone, God bless her.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.042
As you know,
she was like a mother to me too.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.961
And the kids shivving you over the house.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.088
But you're a PI now.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.675
And I'm out of camp,
and I'm ready for a new chapter.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.386
Okay, I'm broke. I'm a felon.

05:45.596 --> 05:49.016
But I taught qigong in there
and it lifted my heart.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.185
Who's qigong? What's he in for?

05:51.185 --> 05:53.437
No, no.
It's a martial arts form of meditation.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.564
But I'm making my own hybrid,

05:55.564 --> 06:00.152
because I wanna teach in a healing way,
you know? How to do battle.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.278
I get it.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.072
- All these disciplines need to evolve.
- Exactly.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.283
I'm leading these gangbangers.

06:06.283 --> 06:10.412
We're sitting in asana,
breathing together, just being.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.291
I mean, this is the shit
that John Lennon died for.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.584
That's beautiful.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.961
It is beautiful, and I wanna share it.

06:18.921 --> 06:23.008
I wanna parlay my inner phoenix
into a qigong center,

06:23.509 --> 06:25.594
right here in the High Des.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.848
I'm gonna have to do
what's called a soul retrieval,

06:30.933 --> 06:36.313
so the part of my soul
that I lost can rejoin me.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.108
Where'd you drop it?

06:45.197 --> 06:46.490
The Alejo Road house.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.369
Is this about the fucking silver?

06:50.369 --> 06:52.329
- It's gotta be worth, like, 20 large.
- Oh, fuck.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.623
You told me you sold it
to pay your lawyer.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.791
Just a calculation.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.751
- Could be more, I don't know.
- You hid it at the house?

06:57.751 --> 06:58.836
It's in the laundry room.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.295
We just have to get in there.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.423
I could've paid the mortgage.
I could've stayed there.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.509
You're such a fucking liar.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.595
I only lied
so we could be together when I got out.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.223
No, you never change.
Nothing ever changes with you.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.976
Peg, this is seed money
for the both of us.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.478
You're going to get, like,
10,000, 12,000 out of this.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.480
This is the time, Peg.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.899
This is the beginning
of the rest of our lives.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.442
The rest of my life's already begun.

07:22.943 --> 07:23.986
Okay?

07:23.986 --> 07:26.738
And there's no you in it. There is no us.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.574
I'm not putting my neck on the line.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.325
- Peg--
- I'm not risking my future.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.995
I'm a PI.
I don't break into people's houses.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.371
- Peg--
- No.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.915
- Really?
- No.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.710
- Okay.
- Just sign the fucking divorce papers,

07:39.710 --> 07:41.503
and just leave me the fuck alone.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.505
Excuse me, waitress.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.674
Guess you need the check?

07:45.674 --> 07:50.470
Can I have a coffee
and an apple pie and a prime rib to go?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.389
And give this fucker the check.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.990
I just want you to know that I'm getting
very close to this guru bastard.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.535
Very, very fucking close.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.162
Fuck. Hold on.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.123
<i>Please tell me you opened the fudge shop.</i>

09:00.123 --> 09:04.628
Yeah, but I just wanted to thank you.
You know, for what you did with Owen.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.172
And I realized it was a big mistake.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.425
<i>The right one's bigger than the left.</i>

09:11.426 --> 09:13.637
<i>And also, stealing is wrong.</i>

09:14.221 --> 09:16.306
You're welcome, hon.
I'll see you soon.

09:16.306 --> 09:21.937
Did he talk about me at all?
Guru Bob? Does he miss me?

09:21.937 --> 09:23.438
No personal calls at work.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.567
Number one, this is business.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.527
And number two,
it's called a work-life balance.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.945
You should try it sometime.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.905
You're supposed to stay away
from that guy.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.240
That was part of our deal.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.992
<i>Plus, he left you lopsided.</i>

09:34.992 --> 09:36.785
Well, how did you get him to pay?

09:36.785 --> 09:40.664
Well, I-- We went to dinner,
I threatened him, he wrote a check.

09:40.664 --> 09:41.748
<i>Dinner?</i>

09:43.834 --> 09:45.627
- <i>Like a date?</i>
- God, no.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.212
Where did he take you? Did he pay?

09:47.212 --> 09:48.380
<i>Tammy, I'm at work.</i>

09:48.380 --> 09:49.965
I'm a professional now.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.216
Okay.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.429
Listen, if we do get the reward for
this bastard's missing wife, I'd like--

09:55.429 --> 09:59.266
All right, listen. How do we even know
that there's still the reward?

09:59.266 --> 10:02.311
We have bigger fish. Where's my IT guy?

10:02.311 --> 10:04.897
Look, you know what this is? It's 1962.

10:04.897 --> 10:08.942
I'm Brian Epstein. You're Decca Records.
You're about to pass on the Beatles.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.069
I'm not seeing the Beatles.

10:11.069 --> 10:15.365
Well, look harder. They're right here.
They're right in our hands.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.202
Please don't throw the Beatles
in the toilet.

10:18.202 --> 10:20.370
You wanna know what's in the toilet,
Peggy?

10:20.370 --> 10:24.541
Hot and Cold Appliance Repair.
My last best client.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.460
With the pink trucks?

10:26.460 --> 10:28.879
- Come on! What kind of messaging is that?
- Okay.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.797
- Is pink hot? Is pink cold?
- Listen. Over here.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.718
If I don't come up with three background
checks for them by next week,

10:34.718 --> 10:36.553
we're gonna be on the street.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.013
What am I paying you for?

10:38.013 --> 10:39.097
You're not paying me.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.809
Listen, I need you to find out
about this reward.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.103
No. No, my plate is already full.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.732
And do not come in here again
without an IT guy.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.816
I gave you one task.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.529
Now you ruined it.
I was gonna surprise you.

10:53.529 --> 10:56.031
I got the guy.
I just got to go pick him up.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.243
You're not even giving me money for gas.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.044
It's not coming.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.881
Maybe try to relax.
You've had two postponements already.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.884
I think I have this thing.
This shy bladder thing.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.137
It's a syndrome.
I had a boyfriend who said I had that.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.060
How about now? Little more privacy.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.022
Hey, you have a son, right?
Is he good with computers?

11:29.606 --> 11:31.608
He's a Carthusian monk in France.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.861
Hey, how about
I just take my week's supply now?

11:33.861 --> 11:36.488
Then I'll come back when I have a day off,
and more time,

11:36.488 --> 11:37.865
and I can freaking relax.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.785
- Hey, miss, are you in there?
- Hold on. I'll be right out.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.078
We're not up to a week yet, Peggy.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.331
And with an incomplete on this test,
you can only get a daily.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.293
I can't come here every day, Mary.
I have a life.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.460
Miss?

11:54.006 --> 11:55.215
Install the software,

11:55.215 --> 11:58.260
fuck around till you figure it out,
then teach him how to use this shit.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.513
- Already installed.
- Bam. Excellent.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.809
Well. Promises made, promises kept.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.395
I've been meeting with my accountant.

12:08.395 --> 12:13.150
Turns out that my ex-partner kept
two sets of books, both fake.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.944
So-- Please.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.864
So I had to liquidate
the stocks I had left.

12:18.864 --> 12:22.075
- I had to sell off all the eBay stuff.
- Pretend I didn't ask.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.328
- Might even lose the house.
- Because I didn't.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.288
So, we'll pay the kid with the eBay money

12:26.288 --> 12:29.583
and you... not so sure.

12:29.583 --> 12:33.086
Okay, buck up. Come on.
We got a fat payday coming down the pike.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.547
I'm telling you, shit is happening.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.467
I can't say more about it right now,
but it is big.

12:38.467 --> 12:39.718
Big?

12:39.718 --> 12:41.428
Don't roll your eyes.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.724
It's disrespectful,
and disrespect is the weapon of the weak.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.019
Don't be weak. I have class.

12:55.526 --> 12:56.527
She's cool.

13:25.889 --> 13:26.723
Fuck!

13:30.811 --> 13:32.813
<i>Fuck you! Fuck you!</i>

13:47.494 --> 13:49.246
Come here, come here.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.165
Special delivery for the brat.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.042
Tell her to stop stalking me.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.127
I was calling you.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.962
I found out more shit
about the guru's wife.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.672
We might be bugged.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.092
- What, like, your phone?
- The buggy.

14:03.969 --> 14:08.974
Listen, I'm 99.9% sure
that this guru bastard murdered his wife.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.226
And I think that he drove her car
to Mexico,

14:11.226 --> 14:14.438
which is dark and premeditated as shit.

14:14.438 --> 14:17.608
I found out where her family is
because I found their rap sheet.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.026
They're Gattchis.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.695
What? Gattchis? How?

14:22.279 --> 14:23.989
I thought the mafia was dead.

14:23.989 --> 14:27.075
They run a tanning spa in Rancho Mirage.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.369
Who wouldn't know a tanning spa's a front?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.705
- Come on, this is the High Des.
- Right?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.832
So the Gattchis offered the reward,

14:33.832 --> 14:36.251
and they're the only ones who know
if it's still active.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.795
Okay, I'm gonna check it out.

14:49.765 --> 14:50.766
Not hiring.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.809
Not applying, hon.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.105
We're not offering lady-on-lady
type massages right now.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.776
The girl that did that kind of thing
lost her foot in a motorcycle accident.

15:00.776 --> 15:04.238
- On, no. Fuck me, Daddy.
- Oh, no. Fuck me, Daddy.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.114
Is Nick around?

15:06.907 --> 15:07.908
Nick!

15:10.118 --> 15:12.829
You're very pale. The tanning bed's open.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.499
I don't think I have time today.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.961
You Nick Gattchi?

15:20.212 --> 15:21.672
Who's asking?

15:21.672 --> 15:23.465
I'll cut to the chase.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.510
I'm writing a book
about my brother, Frank.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.930
He disappeared five years ago.
Poof! He was gone.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.558
I hear we share the same kind of grief.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.686
You were great, cutie.
Down here on the left.

15:35.686 --> 15:37.479
Yeah, I'm a little busy at the moment.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.941
- Is there any more mayo in the fridge?
- Nah, we're out.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.361
You too busy to make money, Nick? Huh?

15:44.361 --> 15:47.239
Oh, yeah. Fuck me, sailor. Oh, yeah.

15:47.239 --> 15:49.783
The government owes us. We're victims.

15:49.783 --> 15:54.621
Last time I checked,
in this country, victims get checks.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.708
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.127
- This fucking bird.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.796
- Yo, Lionel Richie, shut up!
- Fuck me, Daddy.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.965
Wen, turn the fucking music up, please.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.466
Oy vey.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.177
We're due reimbursements.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.637
Payments for pain and suffering.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.766
Plus, the right to hold state funerals,
which, if I'm being honest,

16:14.766 --> 16:18.562
that's usually reserved for presidents,
but we can make the case.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.522
Look.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.817
We already put up a reward for Dona.
We put up 70 G's,

16:23.817 --> 16:25.152
so making money's not a--

16:25.152 --> 16:26.945
Is that money in escrow?

16:28.739 --> 16:33.493
Because most families keep
the reward money in escrow. I do.

16:34.369 --> 16:38.040
Look, I pray that Donatella comes home,
but if she doesn't,

16:38.040 --> 16:40.876
don't you deserve a payday
for the suffering?

16:42.544 --> 16:46.298
- How much you talking?
- Like, three mil each, maybe more.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.091
But we gotta build the case.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.385
My lawyers are experts in class action.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.346
The Lockerbie plane crash...

16:53.263 --> 16:56.600
- They did that?
- That was a billion-dollar settlement.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.227
Billion, with a B.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.772
What's the name of the firm?

17:02.356 --> 17:04.358
They consulted. Eckhart & Tolle.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.193
Wait a second, what's your name?

17:06.734 --> 17:08.362
Sylvia Plath.

17:10.821 --> 17:14.660
It might say that I'm dead
but that's another Sylvia Plath.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.036
I scrubbed all my shit.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.955
You're very pale.
You want ten minutes in the tanning bed?

17:18.955 --> 17:20.332
No, I'm good.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.001
What do you think happened to Donatella?

17:23.836 --> 17:25.712
I don't know. She split.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.464
This you? <i>The Bell Jar</i> book?

17:28.464 --> 17:32.386
No, that's the dead Sylvia.
That book's a downer.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.471
So you don't think somebody killed her?

17:34.471 --> 17:38.141
- Like her husband?
- Her husband?

17:38.141 --> 17:39.226
That guy? No.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.896
- So, not the husband Bob?
- No, Dona. No.

17:42.896 --> 17:46.525
Fuck me, Daddy. What did you do?
Fuck me, sailor.

17:46.525 --> 17:48.735
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Bird's got a mouth on it.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.696
Goes off every time he hears his name.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.991
- Bob's?
- Fuck, fuck. No, Dona.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.702
- She had that thing forever.
- Fuck me, sailor.

17:57.244 --> 18:00.622
Anyway,
that guy's a granola-eating fruitcake.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.374
- Couldn't do it.
- I don't know.

18:02.374 --> 18:05.085
He's pretty buff.
From the pictures I've seen.

18:05.085 --> 18:09.673
You know, powerful in his own way.
But he could kill.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.300
Nah.

18:11.925 --> 18:15.512
Dona hated him. She took all the money.
You should've seen the note.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.765
So, why didn't she tell you
where she was going, if she was going?

18:18.765 --> 18:22.477
Look, she had issues with the family,
all right? I don't need to get into that.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.771
Let's just say there was all of us
and then there was her.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.481
We busted our humps to make a living.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.817
And she spent it all going to art school, okay?

18:28.817 --> 18:31.153
We were businesspeople, she wasn't.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.739
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.073
Fuck me, sailor.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.868
- So, when's that book coming out?
- About a year.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.536
I've got other families I gotta talk to.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.205
- I'll be in touch.
- Hold on.

18:41.747 --> 18:45.209
- Come with me for a sec.
- Oh, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.252
- So there is a reward, right?
- Yeah.

18:47.252 --> 18:50.380
Gonna offer you a free tanning session
because I can't look at you.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.800
Yes, Tony! Yeah! Yes!

18:56.512 --> 18:57.721
Is that a lithograph?

19:02.559 --> 19:04.311
This is oil on canvas.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.771
Yeah. Dona did that.

19:08.398 --> 19:09.483
Dona did this?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.569
It looks like a Magritte.

19:14.780 --> 19:18.367
That's Magritte's wife, actually.
You know the history of this thing?

19:18.367 --> 19:21.787
History is he had a wife that's
a little too chunky, at least for me.

19:21.787 --> 19:24.790
I mean, I go for a broad,
flat stomach, nice tan.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.042
But Dona, she loved this shit.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.379
Anyway, come on. Jump in.
Come on. Let's go, come on.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.091
What did you do?

19:34.091 --> 19:36.718
Oh, yeah. Lionel Richie is
a sad little fuck these days.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.305
She had him 30 years.
And he was like her kid.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.058
Plucked all his fucking feathers out
when she left.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.686
Fuck me, Daddy. Oh, no.

19:47.396 --> 19:48.397
Oh, yeah.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.277
Evidently, she had a thing
for Lionel Richie, but whatever.

19:53.986 --> 19:57.072
The point is, she made replicas
of stolen masterpieces,

19:57.072 --> 19:59.908
<i>and the swami sold them to mobsters.</i>

19:59.908 --> 20:03.036
<i>I mean</i>,
<i>all signs point to Donatella's dead.</i>

20:03.912 --> 20:07.833
- Poor Dona.
- I know. It's a loss to humanity, Carol.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.918
The girl could paint.

20:09.918 --> 20:14.464
I mean, I'm not an art appraiser per se
but I got an eye.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.924
<i>And for a second there,</i>

20:15.924 --> 20:18.886
<i>I thought I was looking
at an honest-to-God Magritte.</i>

20:19.970 --> 20:22.347
Plus, that bird knows
more than it's saying.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.852
Why do you think he killed her?
Was he jealous?

20:26.852 --> 20:30.314
Yeah. They were running the scam,
and something went wrong.

20:30.314 --> 20:33.150
That guru's got blood
and bird shit on his hands.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.319
I gotta go pick up
that missing persons report.

20:35.861 --> 20:38.113
Hey! Get the hell out of my car!

20:38.113 --> 20:40.324
I gotta go defuse a lunatic.
Meet me at Mommy's.

20:40.324 --> 20:43.368
Are you nuts?
Who gets into someone else's car?

20:43.368 --> 20:44.786
Yeah, my bad. I'm late.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.288
You were blocking me.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.498
Honey, I've shot people for less.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.375
Well, then it's my lucky day, right?

20:51.460 --> 20:52.461
Are those acrylics?

20:55.339 --> 20:57.925
Yeah. I did them.

20:58.675 --> 20:59.593
That's my shop.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.719
Wowza.

21:02.346 --> 21:03.514
May I?

21:05.474 --> 21:07.643
Wow. How do you do that?

21:07.643 --> 21:08.977
Experience.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.855
Well, it's not just that, it's a gift.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.108
Stop by. I'll give you a discount.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.152
Okay.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.237
Don't do that again.

21:18.237 --> 21:19.446
Thank you.

21:21.365 --> 21:24.618
Missing persons report.
Dona Scarborough left a note for Bob.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.124
- Wow. So mean.
- Right?

21:31.124 --> 21:33.168
So she did leave. She left.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.461
But she left Lionel Richie.

21:34.461 --> 21:38.382
She loved that fucking bird.
Even though it has a very foul mouth.

21:38.882 --> 21:43.262
Now it lives in a whorehouse
plucking out its feathers. Brokenhearted.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.640
He killed her. I'm sure of it.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.935
I should go get that bird.

21:50.644 --> 21:51.770
You're so sweet.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.106
You would take in a bald bird?

21:54.606 --> 21:55.732
Such a caring person.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.902
I don't know if I'll be able to sleep
tonight thinking about that bird.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.572
This world is just too much.

22:02.281 --> 22:03.115
Hey.

22:04.700 --> 22:09.788
We just have to carry that, Carol.
We just have to carry it.

22:10.914 --> 22:14.668
PS, you should reach out to your sister
because Stewart pressures her.

22:14.668 --> 22:17.462
You know how he is. He's trapped in stone.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.548
You said
he didn't even cry at the funeral.

22:19.548 --> 22:20.966
Not a tear.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.968
Not even when I sang
"The Wind Beneath My Wings."

22:22.968 --> 22:24.344
What?

22:24.928 --> 22:27.097
I should've released doves too.

22:27.097 --> 22:29.933
Regret. It feels like acid reflux.

22:31.894 --> 22:33.687
Anyway, I tried to reach out to her.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.232
So, try again?

22:47.701 --> 22:49.453
Dianne. Hey.

22:49.453 --> 22:52.789
Do me a favor, meet me at P. Town.
I have something to show you.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.209
What do you mean "no?"

22:56.126 --> 22:58.712
Okay, fine,
then I'll just tell you on the phone.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.881
Look, I found some naughty shit
you wrote in high school

23:00.881 --> 23:03.008
that you tried to submit
to <i>Penthouse Forum</i>.

23:03.592 --> 23:06.845
Some fantasy about
being in a dugout with Lenny Dykstra.

23:07.471 --> 23:10.432
Mommy held onto it.
She was always so proud of you.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.102
Anyhow, I could send it
to your house but if your kid--

23:15.896 --> 23:18.524
Okay. Well, I'll see you then.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.276
Yay.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.447
<i>Come back to the bunkhouse
just out of Pioneertown.</i>

23:40.170 --> 23:41.797
For your mother. And you.

23:42.589 --> 23:46.134
Peggy, did you know Ginger
was a regular in <i>Knight Rider</i>?

23:46.134 --> 23:48.053
Semi-regular. Semi.

23:48.053 --> 23:52.266
Excuse me. Does the talent go in
and make paper dolls out of the ledgers?

23:52.266 --> 23:55.394
And if she's on a horse,
who's got their eyes on the books?

23:56.144 --> 23:58.021
Anything could be happening right now.

23:59.731 --> 24:00.858
Excuse me. No!

24:00.858 --> 24:05.153
Now they're eating each other's faces.
That's not accurate to the period.

24:05.153 --> 24:07.030
Don't stress over a man.

24:07.030 --> 24:11.076
I say be like a cat. Let them come to you.

24:11.869 --> 24:13.453
How long you been single?

24:14.413 --> 24:16.081
Thirty-four years.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.878
Hey, how'd you like
to make some real money?

24:21.628 --> 24:23.338
I'm not making any kind of money.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.716
How'd you like to play an art buyer?

24:27.759 --> 24:31.972
I played an art enthusiast
in <i>The Thomas Crown Affair</i>.

24:32.806 --> 24:33.891
"It's nice."

24:35.601 --> 24:36.810
That was my line.

24:37.603 --> 24:40.314
Russo was threatened.
She made them cut it.

24:41.398 --> 24:44.610
Okay. Ginger, go inside. Get in character.

24:45.194 --> 24:46.737
- Hi!
- <i>All right. I'm here.</i>

24:46.737 --> 24:47.946
Hey!

24:47.946 --> 24:48.947
Hi.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.450
- Okay, you ready?
- Ready for what?

24:51.450 --> 24:54.828
Okay. Just do a scene with fake Mommy.

24:54.828 --> 24:56.455
Just say everything you couldn't say.

24:56.455 --> 24:58.123
It'll help. I swear on my life.

24:59.374 --> 25:00.918
What about the <i>Penthouse</i> letter?

25:00.918 --> 25:03.962
I threw that filthy thing away
'cause I look out for you.

25:04.630 --> 25:07.049
Remember when I read
that fucking coach the riot act

25:07.049 --> 25:08.842
for not letting you play Little League?

25:09.551 --> 25:11.470
I always believed in you. Okay?

25:13.931 --> 25:15.432
Just give me ten minutes.

25:18.852 --> 25:20.145
Ginger!

25:20.145 --> 25:22.189
Since we're
workshopping this indefinitely,

25:22.189 --> 25:25.651
Dianne here will be playing
another daughter for a while.

25:25.651 --> 25:28.111
- Dianne...
- Can you not use my real name, please?

25:28.111 --> 25:30.656
...Isis. Dianisis. Okay.

25:30.656 --> 25:36.912
You're on your deathbed obviously,
and you and Dianisis have lost contact.

25:37.663 --> 25:41.333
No one could really get over
what happened when Jerry left.

25:41.917 --> 25:42.918
Bastard.

25:43.794 --> 25:47.214
You recall the scene
when Stewart is sucking his thumb.

25:47.881 --> 25:50.133
- How old's this kid again?
- He's nine.

25:50.801 --> 25:53.762
Is there something wrong with him?
It's a little old to suck your thumb.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.182
This is a "no shame zone," Ginger.

25:58.267 --> 25:59.768
I can't do this.

25:59.768 --> 26:02.354
I'm sorry. It's just too weird.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.022
Hey. No, get back down.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.817
You're on your deathbed
in and out of worlds.

26:07.526 --> 26:08.610
Dianisis.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.405
You have to tell Mommy
how you really feel.

26:11.405 --> 26:15.367
Look at her.
She's open, completely available to hear.

26:16.159 --> 26:19.079
Just open your heart, open your mouth.

26:19.830 --> 26:22.541
She's ready to hear.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.044
- Hold the work in the saloon!
- Sorry, Peg.

26:26.044 --> 26:27.129
Come on.

26:28.005 --> 26:29.214
Stay with the moment.

26:31.800 --> 26:35.637
Stay in this moment. And... action!

26:42.352 --> 26:46.648
Mommy, I didn't see you before you died.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.066
Were you scared?

26:50.068 --> 26:52.279
Course I was. Who wouldn't be?

26:53.071 --> 26:54.781
Ginger, you're unconscious.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.329
Okay, I remember before Daddy left,

27:00.329 --> 27:03.957
you took me to see Alvin Ailey
in the city and we sat way up top,

27:04.708 --> 27:10.380
and you cried...
because you were just so in awe.

27:11.173 --> 27:13.926
And then we went for ice cream
at Grand Central Station,

27:13.926 --> 27:17.304
and you told me
you wanted to be a dancer once.

27:20.641 --> 27:22.559
And then I fell asleep on the train.

27:24.061 --> 27:27.105
And that day, you were all mine.

27:30.234 --> 27:33.028
But then Daddy left,
and you turned into a ghost.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.617
People die before they die sometimes.

27:41.036 --> 27:43.539
I kept trying to get you to see me again...

27:45.999 --> 27:46.959
but it hurt too much.

27:46.959 --> 27:48.418
I couldn't do it anymore!

27:50.087 --> 27:52.339
I see people waiting for me.

27:54.174 --> 27:58.011
I just thought that if I was good enough,
that if I was successful enough,

27:58.011 --> 27:59.179
you would come back.

28:01.181 --> 28:02.182
But you were gone.

28:07.104 --> 28:09.273
Mommy, I just wanna say that I love you.

28:11.567 --> 28:13.068
Okay? And--

28:15.571 --> 28:16.989
And I forgive you.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.666
I forgive you too.

28:28.876 --> 28:31.128
You're unconscious, Ginger!

28:31.128 --> 28:33.255
What? For what?
What would you forgive me for?

28:33.255 --> 28:35.090
For being selfish.

28:35.841 --> 28:36.925
What is she doing?

28:36.925 --> 28:39.386
It just felt right.
She's a little clingy.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.513
Oh, my-- This is bullshit.

28:42.306 --> 28:44.016
Screw this. She sucks.

28:47.728 --> 28:49.688
It was kind of cathartic though, right?

28:49.688 --> 28:53.233
Cathartic? Peggy, no!
I actually feel worse now.

28:53.734 --> 28:55.277
She was not a good Mommy.

28:55.277 --> 28:57.696
I know. That makes two of them.

29:06.830 --> 29:09.791
Oh, my-- Would you just go away? Please!

29:12.002 --> 29:13.837
You really shit the bed on that one.

29:14.755 --> 29:16.507
I hope you're a better art buyer.

29:30.437 --> 29:31.605
It's nice.

29:31.605 --> 29:34.399
Nice? Yeah, it's a Cézanne.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.026
Don't get touchy.

29:36.026 --> 29:38.695
- It's a fucking Cézanne.
- It's quite classic,

29:38.695 --> 29:41.448
from a modern sort of modality.

29:41.448 --> 29:44.243
Or the other way around,
I think, actually.

29:47.037 --> 29:48.539
900,000?

29:48.539 --> 29:50.123
Not even close.

29:50.123 --> 29:53.836
- Why don't you go call your guy?
- Oh, yes. Yes! Yes.

29:53.836 --> 29:57.881
Now is the time. Indeed.

29:59.550 --> 30:00.634
Is she mentally ill?

30:00.634 --> 30:02.553
She's on the spectrum.

30:02.553 --> 30:04.721
But she's totally legit.

30:04.721 --> 30:06.431
The point is, her guy is loaded.

30:06.431 --> 30:08.976
We need someone for Kachel to bid against.

30:08.976 --> 30:10.477
He's gotta feel the heat.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.688
Wait. She's not working for our guy?

30:12.688 --> 30:14.439
I thought
she was working for James Kachel.

30:14.439 --> 30:17.526
No, she works for a guy
that Kachel fucking hates.

30:17.526 --> 30:19.945
You told me
she was working for James Kachel.

30:20.737 --> 30:26.326
Do you want 1.3? Did you tell me
you wanted 1.3, or didn't ya?

30:26.326 --> 30:28.996
- Yeah.
- Well, this is how we get to 1.3.

30:32.165 --> 30:36.545
Yes, I certainly will, sir. Yes. Ciao.

30:39.590 --> 30:43.427
- We'll be in touch.
- Okay. Don't touch. Come, come.

30:45.012 --> 30:46.096
<i>How bad is it?</i>

30:46.763 --> 30:51.059
It's bad.
I thought it was bad, but it's worse.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.478
Do you have an umbrella? I'm very fair.

30:53.478 --> 30:55.147
How much worse? What do you mean?

30:55.147 --> 30:56.607
Or a hat, maybe?

30:56.607 --> 30:59.109
<i>I mean,
I might have to declare bankruptcy.</i>

30:59.943 --> 31:02.738
You can't declare bankruptcy.

31:02.738 --> 31:05.908
I'm inches away from a payday.
This is my life's work.

31:06.867 --> 31:08.035
What am I gonna do?

31:09.661 --> 31:11.705
I can't do anything else. I'm an asshole.

31:11.705 --> 31:14.458
Look, just give me today, maybe tomorrow.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.960
Okay. By Thursday.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.421
<i>Just keep it together. Semper fi.</i>

31:20.088 --> 31:21.215
Semper fi.

31:24.885 --> 31:27.513
<i>In today's qigong instruction,</i>

31:27.513 --> 31:30.641
<i>we will be concentrating on
sealing our gates.</i>

31:32.017 --> 31:33.644
<i>Squeeze the buttocks.</i>

31:35.062 --> 31:36.563
<i>And tilt the pelvis.</i>

31:41.276 --> 31:42.361
Who is that?

31:43.487 --> 31:44.655
This is Judy.

31:45.155 --> 31:47.699
- Judy, huh?
- Some SOB left her in a hot car.

31:47.699 --> 31:51.828
I was like, "Nope, that's not gonna
happen today. You're coming with me."

31:51.828 --> 31:52.913
Right, Judy?

31:53.455 --> 31:56.166
All right. I'm gonna help you
get the silver back for 60%

31:56.166 --> 31:58.544
since you should've given it to me
in the first place.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.254
- I actually think 50-50 is--
- All right,

32:00.254 --> 32:03.465
do not try to chisel me down
one-eighth of a percent, or I'm out.

32:04.299 --> 32:05.509
Okay.

32:06.176 --> 32:07.344
And I need a favor.

32:07.344 --> 32:08.554
Whatever you need.

32:09.429 --> 32:12.057
You up for a little Miami Shock and Awe?

32:13.684 --> 32:14.726
Who's the mark?

32:16.061 --> 32:17.896
This guru bastard.

32:17.896 --> 32:19.398
What do you wanna know about him?

32:19.398 --> 32:21.358
If he killed his wife.

32:21.358 --> 32:26.363
I'll tell you more if it's necessary
but for now, it's a need-to-know basis.

32:29.616 --> 32:30.868
Okay. Sounds good.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.246
And get the dog off the bed.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.209
How come?

32:39.209 --> 32:40.752
Because we're gonna have sex.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.045
Judy, off the bed.
