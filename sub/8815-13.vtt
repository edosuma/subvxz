00:01.252 --> 00:02.836
<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

00:03.046 --> 00:05.048
<i>Those wings out there
in the human world,</i>

00:05.256 --> 00:07.384
Luci, they're too powerful.
A piece of divinity.

00:07.592 --> 00:09.970
<i>You know exactly what's
causing your vulnerability.</i>

00:10.178 --> 00:11.513
<i>Chloe Decker is the one
I should be throwing knives at.</i>

00:11.721 --> 00:13.181
<i>Demon daggers</i>

00:13.390 --> 00:15.892
forged in Hell don't count.
We all know those prick.

00:16.101 --> 00:17.143
What do you want from me,
Malcolm?

00:17.352 --> 00:18.228
<i>You're gonna go into Evidence</i>

00:18.436 --> 00:19.521
<i>and borrow something for me.</i>

00:19.729 --> 00:20.605
What's that?

00:20.814 --> 00:22.273
This is my Pentecostal coin.

00:22.482 --> 00:24.734
I suppose you could use it
to get out of Hell.

00:24.943 --> 00:27.445
<i>It's all yours
if you don't shoot me.</i>

00:27.654 --> 00:29.280
<i>You sent your demon to kill me.</i>

00:31.366 --> 00:33.284
If only you'd done what was
asked of you, I'd still be home!

00:34.911 --> 00:37.580
Enough! You both used me. Here.

00:38.540 --> 00:39.541
Kill each other.

00:39.749 --> 00:42.877
Evil is here. Evil is here.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.713
"Morningstar." Whoa.

00:44.921 --> 00:46.381
<i>Somebody could be doing this
on his behalf,</i>

00:46.589 --> 00:48.174
<i>or maybe he's involved
in a different way.</i>

00:48.383 --> 00:50.301
<i>You did this.
You killed those people.</i>

00:50.510 --> 00:53.763
- I did this for you.
Aren't you happy?
- Why would I be happy?

00:53.972 --> 00:55.265
<i>The last place the preacher
was seen was near LUX.</i>

00:57.392 --> 00:59.227
Put your hands up.

00:59.394 --> 01:02.105
Lucifer Morningstar,
you're under arrest.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.237
Come on, Detective.

01:09.404 --> 01:11.990
You can't seriously believe
I killed

01:12.198 --> 01:13.783
that pathetic malcontent.

01:13.992 --> 01:15.827
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

01:19.372 --> 01:21.249
That's all that matters,
Detective.

01:23.793 --> 01:25.920
Put your hands in the air
and surrender yourself.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.473
This isn't funny, Lucifer.

01:36.681 --> 01:37.640
Isn't it?

01:37.849 --> 01:39.601
I think

01:39.809 --> 01:42.979
this is the grandest joke
that I've heard in all my time.

01:43.188 --> 01:46.024
The best part is it's on me!

01:49.569 --> 01:51.029
Come peacefully.

01:51.237 --> 01:52.781
We'll go to the station...

01:52.989 --> 01:54.282
No.

01:54.449 --> 01:56.284
We won't.

01:56.493 --> 01:58.036
What are you doing?

01:58.244 --> 02:00.914
I'm accepting my role
in all of this.

02:01.122 --> 02:04.375
All of humanity's sins
are the Devil's fault, right?

02:04.584 --> 02:06.503
I mean, I thought you knew
different, but I was wrong.

02:06.711 --> 02:08.797
You're just like all the others.

02:09.005 --> 02:10.298
So,

02:10.507 --> 02:13.218
why not add one more murder
to the pile?

02:13.426 --> 02:14.427
That's not what this is,
Lucifer.

02:14.636 --> 02:15.845
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

02:16.054 --> 02:17.138
You wanted your bad guy.
Well, here he is,

02:17.347 --> 02:19.057
gift-wrapped just for you!

02:19.265 --> 02:20.016
Don't take another step.

02:20.225 --> 02:20.809
You!

02:21.017 --> 02:22.685
Newbie.

02:22.894 --> 02:24.979
Come on. Riddle me with bullets,

02:25.188 --> 02:27.357
so you can go home,
drink an ice-cold beer,

02:27.565 --> 02:29.567
and feel better
about yourselves!

02:29.776 --> 02:31.194
Don't shoot him.
He's unarmed.

02:31.402 --> 02:32.821
Oh, you don't know that.
Maybe I have a gun.

02:33.029 --> 02:33.863
Hands in the air!

02:34.072 --> 02:35.490
- Do it!
- Don't!

02:44.582 --> 02:47.710
What just happened?

02:49.170 --> 02:51.297
Search the area.

02:51.506 --> 02:54.217
He can't have gotten far.

03:06.020 --> 03:06.771
Can we not tell anyone

03:06.980 --> 03:08.648
you just carried me in your arms
like a baby?

03:08.857 --> 03:10.400
What were you trying
to accomplish in there?

03:10.608 --> 03:13.403
Uh, a good death?

03:13.611 --> 03:15.405
Or at least
a nice and messy one.

03:15.613 --> 03:18.408
But then you had to come and
ruin everything, like always.

03:22.954 --> 03:25.373
Why'd you swoop in and stop it?

03:25.582 --> 03:28.126
Wouldn't let someone else
send me to Hell, is that it?

03:28.334 --> 03:31.588
Well, guess what, brother,
you don't need to kill me,

03:31.796 --> 03:34.924
because I'm done here.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.177
I've had my fun on Earth, and...

03:39.304 --> 03:41.598
...there's no reason for me
to stay anymore.

03:41.806 --> 03:43.474
You win.

03:43.683 --> 03:45.101
I'll go willingly.

03:45.310 --> 03:47.270
Please, just...

03:47.478 --> 03:49.230
take me back to Hell.

03:49.439 --> 03:50.773
No.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.495
Hey. What happened
to Lucifer?

04:04.704 --> 04:06.497
You didn't hear?

04:06.706 --> 04:08.166
What happened to him?

04:08.374 --> 04:10.084
He disappeared. He's on the run.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.628
Ow.

04:14.756 --> 04:16.257
Let me see that.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.259
Have you ever seen
a knife like this?

04:18.468 --> 04:21.095
Yeah. Uh, I'll take it
to the station.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.139
Careful. It's crazy sharp.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.233
Great.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.817
Hey.

04:35.026 --> 04:35.860
I need to talk to you.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.281
I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

04:40.490 --> 04:41.616
especially after
what just happened,

04:41.824 --> 04:43.826
but I think
Lucifer is innocent.

04:44.035 --> 04:46.412
Chloe, Lucifer got into a fight
with the deceased

04:46.621 --> 04:47.997
just a couple hours ago.
We both saw it.

04:48.206 --> 04:49.457
I know. Just hear me out.

04:49.624 --> 04:51.918
Okay? Just pretend
you don't know Lucifer.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.920
- I already like it.
- Our suspect

04:54.128 --> 04:56.297
is a club owner who likes
to tell people he's the Devil.

04:56.506 --> 04:58.049
You're not really selling
his innocence.

04:58.258 --> 05:01.052
He's a man who embraces desire,
lives by his passion.

05:01.261 --> 05:03.846
Now think about the body.
The guy was executed,

05:04.055 --> 05:05.473
single bullet to the head.

05:05.682 --> 05:07.850
There's no passion
behind this.

05:08.059 --> 05:09.852
- This isn't him.
- Then it's a frame job.

05:10.061 --> 05:11.229
Who would want to set him up?

05:11.437 --> 05:13.147
- I don't know.
- Detective,

05:13.356 --> 05:14.732
we may have found
the murder weapon.

05:14.941 --> 05:17.277
Okay. Test it
for prints and DNA.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.320
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks.

05:21.698 --> 05:23.700
Lucifer's prints
are gonna be on that gun.

05:23.908 --> 05:25.326
- You don't know that.
- I do.

05:25.535 --> 05:27.203
And I also know you're right.

05:27.412 --> 05:28.705
Lucifer's innocent.

05:28.913 --> 05:30.498
What?

05:30.707 --> 05:33.001
Chloe, we have to talk.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.044
Somewhere else.

05:36.671 --> 05:39.757
You don't want to take me back
to Hell?

05:39.966 --> 05:43.428
The one bloody thing
you've wanted this entire time.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.221
Did I punch you

05:45.430 --> 05:46.431
in the head too hard?

05:46.639 --> 05:48.558
Maze was right, Luci.

05:48.766 --> 05:49.642
We used her.

05:49.851 --> 05:51.311
And Malcolm.
People have died

05:51.519 --> 05:52.437
because of us.

05:52.645 --> 05:53.896
Because of you, you mean.

05:54.105 --> 05:55.898
Yes. Because of me.

05:56.107 --> 05:56.816
Right.

05:59.152 --> 06:01.696
Brother, somehow I lost sight
of the bigger picture,

06:01.904 --> 06:03.448
of the cost of my actions,

06:03.656 --> 06:05.908
and just how truly selfish
they were.

06:06.117 --> 06:08.244
But, Luci,
my eyes are wide open now,

06:08.453 --> 06:10.246
and I need to make this right.

06:10.455 --> 06:11.789
Do you know, I think this side
of you's actually scarier

06:11.998 --> 06:12.790
than the angry one.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.417
I need to find Malcolm,

06:14.625 --> 06:16.294
and I need
to send him back to Hell.

06:18.671 --> 06:20.548
Will you help me, brother?

06:24.302 --> 06:27.263
One last bit of punishment
on the way out.

06:29.057 --> 06:31.768
It sounds like fun to me.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.070
Ah, there's nothing like

06:42.278 --> 06:44.447
a fresh shirt after
a rainy rooftop.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.866
What is that smell?

06:47.075 --> 06:49.535
Tropical musk candles.

06:49.744 --> 06:52.872
Gosh, the sacrifices you made
pretending to be a therapist.

06:53.081 --> 06:53.998
Yeah, I like that scent.

06:54.207 --> 06:55.583
- Of course you do.
- Okay,

06:55.792 --> 06:57.543
can we please just focus?

06:57.752 --> 07:00.004
- Now, what's your plan
to find Malcolm?
- My plan?

07:00.213 --> 07:02.632
- Yeah.
- Well, I thought you were
the expert at plotting murder.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.093
Or not so expert,
considering I'm still alive.

07:05.301 --> 07:06.386
Which is why
I brought us here,

07:06.594 --> 07:07.804
so that we could come up
with a plan.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.806
Right. Well,
it sounds more like you want me

07:10.014 --> 07:12.350
to do all the heavy lifting.
So how's this? Step one,

07:12.558 --> 07:14.727
travel back in time and not make
such a mess of things.

07:14.936 --> 07:16.562
You know, I'm suddenly reminded
of why I wanted you dead

07:16.771 --> 07:17.855
in the first place.

07:18.064 --> 07:19.816
Luci, what is
your problem?

07:20.024 --> 07:21.692
Oh, good question, Doctor.
Well, you see,

07:21.901 --> 07:23.945
the thing is that my brother
has been trying to kill me

07:24.153 --> 07:25.446
and now he wants
to work with me

07:25.655 --> 07:27.073
but we can't seem to get along,

07:27.281 --> 07:28.616
mainly because
he's an egotistical twit.

07:28.825 --> 07:29.659
Hello?

07:29.867 --> 07:31.702
Oh, I'm sorry,
Dr. Canaan.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.371
I didn't realize
that you were in session

07:33.579 --> 07:35.456
with a... Lucifer?

07:36.082 --> 07:37.417
Oh.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.085
I can't believe this.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.254
You're stealing my patient.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.923
Uh, not exactly.

07:44.132 --> 07:47.176
Actually, you may be just
what we need, my dear doctor.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.392
I deserve that.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.601
You lied to me.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.103
I don't even know you.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.021
You shot a man in cold blood.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.773
I shot Malcolm to protect you.

08:00.982 --> 08:04.277
Everything I saw at Palmetto,
it was all true!

08:04.485 --> 08:06.279
You let them think I was crazy.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.281
- I never intended...
- You let me think
I was crazy.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.449
I'm sorry.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.659
You don't get to be sorry.

08:11.868 --> 08:13.035
If I could take it all back,
I would.

08:13.244 --> 08:14.579
You can't take it back!

08:15.830 --> 08:16.581
I know.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.959
But you can make this right.

08:22.044 --> 08:22.962
How?

08:23.171 --> 08:24.881
Prove Lucifer is innocent.

08:26.966 --> 08:28.134
Where are
you going?

08:28.342 --> 08:30.136
Lucifer thinks I abandoned him.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.179
I need to find him.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.477
So you're-you're brothers?

08:38.686 --> 08:39.479
Unfortunately.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.981
And we're having a
terrible time working together.

08:42.190 --> 08:43.857
But because you've been
so helpful with me, Linda,

08:44.066 --> 08:45.610
hopefully you can help fix
our problems.

08:45.818 --> 08:47.487
Listen, I know
this must be a shock...

08:47.695 --> 08:48.821
Are you even a real doctor?

08:49.030 --> 08:50.823
No, of course he isn't.

08:51.032 --> 08:53.242
Gosh, if he had any clue
about human nature,

08:53.451 --> 08:54.243
we wouldn't be in this mess.

08:54.452 --> 08:56.496
Oh. You dare criticize me?

08:56.704 --> 08:58.039
Luci, you're arrogant,
you're selfish,

08:58.247 --> 08:59.957
- all you do is think
with your penis...
- Oh.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.584
Oh. Which, of course,
you would never do, would you?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.002
How's Maze, by the way?

09:03.211 --> 09:04.629
Dr. Martin, will you
please tell him to shut up

09:04.837 --> 09:06.172
and just listen to reason?

09:06.380 --> 09:08.090
Oh, if by reason,
you mean a deceptive load

09:08.299 --> 09:09.008
- of bull...
- Enough!

09:10.593 --> 09:13.346
You lied to me
about being a doctor

09:13.554 --> 09:15.389
so you could
manipulate Lucifer,

09:15.598 --> 09:16.682
who is actually

09:16.891 --> 09:18.184
your brother.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.519
Somehow.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.854
Do you realize

09:22.063 --> 09:23.814
the ethical position
you've put me in?

09:25.024 --> 09:26.859
And you, let me guess,

09:27.068 --> 09:27.902
you were gonna make
a sexual joke

09:28.110 --> 09:29.153
about putting me in a position.

09:29.362 --> 09:31.197
That's true, yeah.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.157
Because everything's
a joke to you.

09:33.366 --> 09:36.035
And yet, for some reason,
I take you seriously,

09:36.244 --> 09:40.039
even when you insist on clinging
to these ridiculous metaphors--

09:40.248 --> 09:42.291
Heaven, Hell, angels, devils.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.668
- Actually, they're not...
- Trust me,

09:43.876 --> 09:44.877
you don't want
to pick that fight.

09:45.253 --> 09:46.420
You claimed
you came to L.A.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.047
to reinvent yourself,
yet every time

09:48.256 --> 09:51.509
I think you come upon
a moment of realization,

09:51.717 --> 09:54.303
you go the exact wrong
direction with it.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.305
I did... Ho-Hold on.
You're right. I did come to L.A.

09:56.514 --> 09:57.682
to start a new life, didn't I?

09:59.517 --> 10:00.768
And now Malcolm's on the run.

10:00.977 --> 10:03.771
He's gonna need
to start a new life, too.

10:03.980 --> 10:05.398
- No, see, you're doing it again.
- New I.D.,

10:05.606 --> 10:06.691
bank account, passport.

10:06.899 --> 10:09.360
I know just the person
to go to.

10:09.569 --> 10:11.195
Oh.

10:11.404 --> 10:13.322
Damn, you're good.

10:13.531 --> 10:14.740
Yep.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.169
Where's Lucifer?

10:28.713 --> 10:30.756
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.095
You've never liked me.

10:36.304 --> 10:37.430
Why?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.599
Because every day was a party.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.435
Every sin,
every desire L.A. offered,

10:42.643 --> 10:44.478
we took part.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.024
And then he met you.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.610
So you think it's my fault
that the party's over?

10:50.818 --> 10:54.322
That and the fact that you're
hunting him down like a dog.

10:56.282 --> 10:57.950
I don't think he killed
the preacher.

10:58.159 --> 11:00.786
I need you to help me find him
before another cop does.

11:00.995 --> 11:02.580
So where would he go?

11:02.788 --> 11:04.457
- You know him better than anyone.
- These days

11:04.665 --> 11:06.250
it seems you know him better
than I do.

11:06.459 --> 11:09.045
So where do you think
he's going?

11:10.504 --> 11:12.381
To get punishment.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.718
Which means
he's going after Malcolm.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.137
Then maybe he hasn't changed
that much after all.

11:18.346 --> 11:20.556
If he gets to Malcolm first,

11:20.765 --> 11:22.600
he really will go down
for murder.

11:29.065 --> 11:30.524
You can't come with me.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.818
You said you needed my help
finding him, right?

11:33.027 --> 11:35.071
I don't see anybody else
backing you up.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.999
Byron was a nice guy,
a handy guy.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.001
He fixed my toaster once.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.962
Not a BLT goes by
I don't think of Byron.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.798
Excuse me!

11:54.006 --> 11:56.008
Yeah, sorry to interrupt
the riveting eulogy,

11:56.217 --> 11:57.843
but I'm here to see
the funeral director.

11:58.052 --> 12:00.012
Hello, Neil.
Remember me?

12:00.221 --> 12:01.180
In a bit of a rush,

12:01.389 --> 12:02.640
unfortunately.

12:02.848 --> 12:06.185
Whereas this poor chap, well,
he's not going anywhere, is he?

12:06.394 --> 12:09.105
Sir, please wait
until after we're finished.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.690
This is disrespectful.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.109
Uh, no, <i>this</i> is disrespectful.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.611
I mean, this whole show--
who's it for, really?

12:15.820 --> 12:17.113
Eh? Not him.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.281
He's not hearing
any of this.

12:19.490 --> 12:21.033
Would you back me up,
please, bro?

12:21.242 --> 12:22.868
He is right.

12:23.077 --> 12:24.787
See? Trust me,
he should know.

12:24.995 --> 12:25.871
No, it's for you,
isn't it?

12:26.080 --> 12:27.790
It's a selfish way

12:27.998 --> 12:30.209
for you to all feel better
about yourselves about how much

12:30.418 --> 12:32.670
you ignored
this poor sod in life.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.381
Oh, did you choose this suit?

12:35.589 --> 12:37.174
Mr. Morningstar,
this way.

12:37.383 --> 12:38.801
Oh, you <i>do</i> remember me?

12:39.009 --> 12:40.219
Feel free to carry on.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.306
You have no right
disrupting this funeral.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.808
- This is my business.
- Yes.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.476
Your least profitable one.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.103
Your main source of income is
creating new identities,

12:49.311 --> 12:51.105
which is why I came to you
five years ago to get

12:51.313 --> 12:52.481
my proper papers and all that.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.358
And I did great work for you,
Mr. Morningstar.

12:54.567 --> 12:57.403
- So why are you doing this?
- Well, if I know you're the best,

12:57.570 --> 12:59.321
then Malcolm Graham
does, as well.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.656
The cop.

13:00.865 --> 13:03.367
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he needed it
to be done fast,

13:03.576 --> 13:05.745
but said he'd need time
to get his hands on the 100K.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.414
Where would a homicide detective
get that kind of money quickly?

13:08.622 --> 13:09.915
Mm, look at you, Sherlock.

13:10.124 --> 13:12.334
He mentioned
an old associate.

13:12.543 --> 13:13.753
Tommy, I think.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.005
Great. We'll do a search

13:16.213 --> 13:17.423
for every "Tommy"
in Los Angeles.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.799
What's another thousand years?

13:19.008 --> 13:20.926
No, no, no, no. An old associate
of Malcolm's, you say?

13:21.135 --> 13:23.888
I think I might know just
the person who can help us.

13:25.014 --> 13:25.765
Rhymes with "douche."

13:25.973 --> 13:27.475
Thanks, Neil.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.106
I wish I had my knives.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.399
You're not gonna need 'em.

13:35.608 --> 13:36.901
I never need them.

13:39.737 --> 13:41.614
LAPD! Malcolm, if...

13:46.118 --> 13:48.078
Oh.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.205
Hello?

13:49.413 --> 13:51.749
Anyone here?

13:54.168 --> 13:56.128
Looks like Malcolm
likes to shop.

13:56.337 --> 13:58.339
You cops must make
a lot of money.

13:58.506 --> 14:00.216
You hiring?

14:00.424 --> 14:02.134
We're not, and we don't.

14:02.343 --> 14:04.970
I have no idea how
he can afford all this stuff.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.973
Well, if you don't make good
money, why do you do this job?

14:08.182 --> 14:09.308
'Cause I get to shoot people,

14:09.517 --> 14:10.976
which is something
you should keep in mind.

14:11.185 --> 14:14.480
No really. Why?

14:14.688 --> 14:17.650
'Cause I hate it when people get
away with things they shouldn't.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.652
And you like
to shoot people.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.111
Yeah.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.113
Huh.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.325
And to think I almost killed you
in your sleep that one time.

14:26.534 --> 14:27.493
Wait. What?

14:34.959 --> 14:37.920
Oh, now I know why he
likes working with you.

14:48.389 --> 14:50.182
Malcolm, it's the police!

14:50.391 --> 14:52.184
Stop firing
and put the gun down!

14:52.393 --> 14:53.978
He's not with you?

14:56.438 --> 14:58.941
Please tell me
he's not with you.

15:03.988 --> 15:07.199
Sorry. I thought
you were my husband.

15:07.408 --> 15:09.285
Mel, why were you shooting
at Malcolm?

15:09.493 --> 15:10.911
Ever since
he almost died, he...

15:11.120 --> 15:13.622
he's been different,
he's been strange.

15:13.831 --> 15:15.165
I can't describe it.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.834
He has a newfound appetite.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.669
An insatiable hunger

15:18.878 --> 15:20.337
he just can't seem to fill.

15:20.546 --> 15:21.589
How do you know?

15:21.797 --> 15:23.173
I've seen it before.

15:23.382 --> 15:24.592
Where?

15:24.800 --> 15:26.677
Right. I forgot
who I was talking to.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.012
It only gets worse.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.179
It can't get worse!

15:29.388 --> 15:30.639
He spent all
our money.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.266
And when I saw him today, he...

15:32.474 --> 15:33.767
Wait. When did he come by today?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.644
You just missed him.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.147
He was frantic. He was looking
for money, and he was angry.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.940
He was so angry.

15:40.149 --> 15:42.359
And he had this look in his eye,
and he said things like...

15:42.568 --> 15:44.820
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

15:46.822 --> 15:48.282
He said he was gonna
go get a beer.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.117
Okay.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.953
Thanks. Excuse me.

15:53.162 --> 15:54.872
Malcolm's good, Chloe.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.957
I can't find any evidence
tying him to the murders.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.667
How's it going on your end?

15:58.876 --> 16:00.753
Malcolm's not home.
Mel said he went out for a beer.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.129
Does that make any sense to you?

16:02.338 --> 16:03.756
No. When I saw him,
he was scared.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.424
I think he knows
Lucifer's gonna come after him.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.176
He looked like a guy
getting ready to run.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.136
Yeah, well, he doesn't have
the money to get far.

16:09.345 --> 16:11.055
Yeah, but he's the kind of guy
who'd know how to find it.

16:11.263 --> 16:13.265
Oh, maybe there's a bar
that owes him money.

16:13.474 --> 16:15.893
Yeah, or one that he could rob
for some extra cash.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.103
I'll look into it.

16:25.527 --> 16:28.072
Don't move,
or wobbly head gets it.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.406
How did you get in here?

16:29.615 --> 16:31.075
There's a manhunt for you.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.576
And this is the last place
you'd look, isn't it?

16:32.785 --> 16:33.661
I thought
it was quite clever.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.162
Ooh.

16:35.329 --> 16:36.747
You need to get
the hell out of here.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.540
Oh, we're gonna need
some information first.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.125
- Who are you?
- Not this again.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.503
He's my brother.
I know, shocking, isn't it?

16:42.711 --> 16:44.004
He's much less handsome
than I am.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.006
We're looking
for Malcolm, Detective.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.300
Now, we've been told that he's
seeing an associate named Tommy?

16:49.093 --> 16:51.261
There are a lot of Tommys in...

16:53.097 --> 16:54.723
A beer. Of course.

16:54.932 --> 16:57.101
We'd very much like to know
what you just realized.

16:57.309 --> 16:58.519
Too bad.
I'm not telling you.

16:58.686 --> 17:01.021
But you want to,
though, don't you?

17:01.230 --> 17:03.232
No, I don't.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.734
Oh, you're a complicated one.
That is a surprise.

17:06.944 --> 17:10.071
So, come on, what do you want
to do, Daniel? Hmm?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.116
I...

17:13.242 --> 17:15.035
I want to redeem myself.

17:15.243 --> 17:18.288
Oh. And taking down Malcolm
would do that, wouldn't it?

17:18.497 --> 17:20.124
So where is he?

17:20.332 --> 17:21.709
Come on, you can tell us.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.252
Like you said,
we're surrounded by police.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.462
There's an old brewery
on Third.

17:25.671 --> 17:27.381
Mm-hmm.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.466
A drug dealer named Tommy
Campolongo works out of there.

17:29.675 --> 17:32.136
Ah. Not that complicated
after all.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.264
So you two will stay
in a holding cell while I...

17:44.690 --> 17:46.358
Okay. Tommy Campolongo.

17:46.567 --> 17:47.901
That makes sense,
that he'd have cash on him.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.778
But he's not gonna
hand it over nicely.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.321
I'm leaving the precinct now.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.990
Okay, meet me there with backup.
I'm not far.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.034
Chloe, don't go...

17:56.160 --> 17:57.619
Damn it.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.250
You like that?

18:05.753 --> 18:09.256
And to think,
after all this time,

18:09.465 --> 18:11.050
I just thought
you were dead.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.218
What can I say?

18:13.427 --> 18:15.345
It's hard to keep
a good man down.

18:15.554 --> 18:17.681
- Mm-hmm.
- And now

18:17.890 --> 18:19.641
I'm ready to get the old band
back together.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.685
You have some product
you can move?

18:21.894 --> 18:23.312
We've got some seizures

18:23.520 --> 18:25.272
just sitting there in evidence.

18:25.439 --> 18:29.151
Could actually get you a supply
today if you've got cash.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.111
I always have cash, Malcolm.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.488
You know that.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.448
That I do, Tommy.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.450
That I do.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.202
How much you thinking?

18:38.410 --> 18:39.495
How much you got?

18:46.251 --> 18:49.505
What's going on up there?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.135
This ain't me.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.388
What you waiting for?!

19:04.603 --> 19:06.396
But hey.

19:06.605 --> 19:09.566
Gift horse and all that--
am I right?

19:11.652 --> 19:14.571
Why don't you go ahead,
open up that safe, my man?

19:19.910 --> 19:21.245
Oh...

19:21.453 --> 19:23.080
hello there.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.581
If you miscreants don't mind,

19:24.790 --> 19:26.625
we're looking
for Malcolm Graham.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.753
Hand him over, and we can
all be on our way
without too much fuss.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.922
You two made a huge mistake
walking in here.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.596
What do you say we skip the
time-slowing shenanigans, hmm?

19:39.805 --> 19:41.723
What about
your mortality situation?

19:41.932 --> 19:43.851
Well, it's kind of a non-sitch
when the detective's not around.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.561
I'll explain later,
but for now,

19:45.769 --> 19:48.480
we'll just, you know,
enjoy the moment.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.280
After you.

19:56.488 --> 19:57.781
Lovely.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.409
Right, I should warn you--

20:02.411 --> 20:05.873
This is hardly a fair fight.

21:01.762 --> 21:03.055
We still need
to find Malcolm.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.139
Absolutely.

21:04.348 --> 21:06.516
You know, if we split up,
we'll cover more ground.

21:06.725 --> 21:08.101
Okay, but no hogging all the fun

21:08.310 --> 21:10.479
if you find him first-- deal?

21:10.687 --> 21:11.521
Deal.

21:13.232 --> 21:14.858
Oh!

21:53.855 --> 21:56.233
Wow. I mean,

21:56.441 --> 21:59.236
wow. I could tell
it was something special,

21:59.444 --> 22:02.406
but I had no idea
that was gonna work.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.576
But you never know
until you try.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.580
Got to say,

22:10.789 --> 22:13.875
you don't look so scary now,
Amenadude.

22:17.004 --> 22:18.505
Oi!

22:18.714 --> 22:21.258
What part of "no hogging"
don't you understand?

22:32.102 --> 22:34.062
Bloody hell!

22:34.271 --> 22:35.272
There you go, spoiling

22:35.480 --> 22:37.065
my fun again.

22:37.274 --> 22:39.735
Leave me, and go get him.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.695
You know how much
I hate being in anyone's debt.

22:41.903 --> 22:44.698
I figure if I save you now,
that makes us even, right?

22:44.906 --> 22:46.783
Besides, it's...

22:46.992 --> 22:48.368
it's just a flesh wound.

22:48.577 --> 22:50.412
Hardly can see
what you're whining about.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.792
What happened?

22:56.001 --> 22:58.587
He was struck with a blade
not of this world, Maze.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.090
One of mine.

23:02.299 --> 23:03.300
Yes.

23:03.508 --> 23:04.801
I'll handle this.

23:05.010 --> 23:05.802
How?

23:06.970 --> 23:08.221
Find him.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.809
With pleasure.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.074
Malcolm, freeze!

23:29.159 --> 23:30.494
Stop!

23:57.229 --> 23:58.397
Don't move.

24:05.404 --> 24:06.822
Easy, Detective.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.949
You're a hard man to find.

24:09.116 --> 24:11.493
Look, I know you think
I'm a bad guy,

24:11.701 --> 24:13.995
but I'm simply trying to catch
our dear friend Malcolm

24:14.204 --> 24:15.914
so I can tear
his arms and legs off.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.752
- This has nothing to do with you.
- You know I can't let you do that.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.504
You don't know
what he's done.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.506
You'd never believe me anyway.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.842
But all you need to know
is that he's here to get money

24:27.050 --> 24:29.386
and then he's gonna disappear.
For good.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.139
You mean this money?

24:33.682 --> 24:35.809
I'm not here to arrest you,
Lucifer.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.352
I know you're innocent.

24:37.561 --> 24:38.979
I always have.

24:40.981 --> 24:42.274
So let's catch
this bastard together

24:42.482 --> 24:44.234
and put an end to all this.

24:47.112 --> 24:50.615
Ah. Look at us, reunited,
and it feels so good.

24:50.824 --> 24:53.285
Malcolm won't get far
without his getaway cash.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.203
Where's Maze?

24:55.412 --> 24:56.997
- She's taking care
of something important.
- Oh, of course

24:57.205 --> 24:59.082
your ninja bartender is off
on a secret mission.

24:59.291 --> 25:00.542
Why, Detective, are you pining

25:00.750 --> 25:02.669
- for some
good cop/demon cop action?
- No.

25:02.878 --> 25:05.046
- I just want to clear your name
and find Malcolm.
- No, no, no, no, no.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.590
Who cares
about the Devil's rap sheet?

25:06.798 --> 25:08.258
Why don't we just skip that part

25:08.467 --> 25:10.010
and go straight
to the main course?

25:10.218 --> 25:13.180
Because it's incredibly
impulsive and shortsighted.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.222
Have you noticed that's my jam?

25:14.431 --> 25:15.807
If we fix your reputation,

25:16.016 --> 25:17.767
we'll preserve
everything we've done.

25:17.976 --> 25:19.561
You want to keep working
with me.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.813
And to do that,
you need to trust me.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.238
- Okay. Well.
- Right. Very well,
Detective.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.574
I'm in your hands.
But how you intend

25:32.782 --> 25:34.326
to prove my innocence
is beyond me.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.536
Put your hands down.

25:36.745 --> 25:38.246
We found the evidence we need.

25:38.455 --> 25:39.581
<i>He</i> did?

25:39.789 --> 25:41.208
Can I rethink my surrender?

25:41.416 --> 25:42.667
What'd you find?

25:42.876 --> 25:45.378
It's better if I show you.

25:52.636 --> 25:55.764
Enough,

25:55.972 --> 25:57.057
Mazikeen.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.100
I've made my peace with death,

25:59.309 --> 26:01.186
whether I go to Heaven or Hell.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.687
I know exactly
where you're going.

26:02.896 --> 26:05.774
Nowhere.
You're staying right here.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.442
Now shut up and let me help you.

26:10.111 --> 26:12.447
There's nothing

26:12.656 --> 26:14.491
that you can do.

26:14.699 --> 26:17.536

to Detective Malcolm Graham.

I believe
Detective Graham

27:25.687 --> 27:27.522
then used that weapon to shoot
and kill Jacob Williams,

27:27.731 --> 27:29.274
the crime that...

27:35.989 --> 27:37.198

27:42.495 --> 27:44.331
Well, not today, at least.

Let's go.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.792
Dan...

27:59.179 --> 28:01.222
I need to take this.

28:01.431 --> 28:04.225
Hey, honey. Everything okay?

28:04.434 --> 28:06.269
Hello, Decker.

28:07.395 --> 28:08.730
Malcolm?

28:08.938 --> 28:10.065
How's the precinct?

28:12.192 --> 28:14.736
I still have a few buddies
at the stations.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.739
Oh, and I made
a new friend today, too.

28:17.947 --> 28:21.076
Pulled her out of a boring class
for some bonding time.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.302
Uh, that's enough of that.

28:41.846 --> 28:44.391
Aw. Poor Chloe Decker.

take something from you,

something valuable?

28:47.727 --> 28:49.020
Hurts, don't it?

Put your hands in the air

30:06.890 --> 30:09.434
and walk towards me peacefully.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.394
If you do not--

30:11.603 --> 30:13.438
I repeat-- if you do not,

30:13.646 --> 30:15.982
we will have no choice
but to shoot you

with our new bazooka.

30:18.526 --> 30:21.488
We've actually been waiting
months and months to use it, so,

30:21.696 --> 30:23.531
on second thought,
please, speed away.

30:23.740 --> 30:24.824
What are you doing?

30:25.033 --> 30:26.075
Well, I could ask you the s...

30:27.744 --> 30:29.746
I could ask you the same thing.

30:29.954 --> 30:32.248
You going somewhere
without me, hmm?

30:32.457 --> 30:33.833
Right after all this talk
about trusting you,

30:34.042 --> 30:35.627
you're immediately
keeping secrets?

30:35.835 --> 30:37.670
I don't have time to explain
to you. Something came up.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.964
Something that obviously
requires quite a bit of cash.

30:40.173 --> 30:41.800
I didn't know
you had it in you, Detective.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.010
- It isn't for me.
- Oh, you're gonna make it rain
at the local strip clubs then?

30:44.219 --> 30:46.054
- Lucifer...
- Or perhaps that
phone call earlier

30:46.262 --> 30:47.972
wasn't as innocuous
as you made it out to be.

30:49.265 --> 30:50.642
Fine. You leave me no choice.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.729
Malcolm has Trixie.

30:57.565 --> 30:58.149
Oh.

30:58.358 --> 31:00.944
If I get him his money,
he'll let her go.

31:01.152 --> 31:02.987
Right. Because if Malcolm's
established anything,

31:03.196 --> 31:04.280
it's his trustworthiness.

31:04.489 --> 31:05.824
What choice do I have?

31:06.032 --> 31:07.492
To ride shotgun with the Devil,
for starters.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.035
If Malcolm sees you,
he'll kill her. I'm sorry,

31:09.244 --> 31:11.246
but I can't risk it--
her life's at stake.

31:11.454 --> 31:13.289
Right. So you're just
gonna get both of you
killed then, are you?

31:13.498 --> 31:15.124
He needs this money
to leave town.

31:15.333 --> 31:17.293
I won't give it to him
until she's safe.

31:17.502 --> 31:18.378
And what about your safety?

31:18.586 --> 31:20.338
Trixie is all that matters.

31:20.547 --> 31:22.298
- Detective, I...
- I don't have time
to argue with you, Lucifer.

31:22.507 --> 31:26.302
I realize how bad this can go,
but I don't have a choice.

31:26.511 --> 31:28.346
This is my daughter.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.934
Promise me
you'll let me go alone.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.978
Fine.

31:35.186 --> 31:36.479
You have my word.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.121
Don't look so sad.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.914
Your mommy's coming
to pick you up.

31:55.123 --> 31:56.833
Good. I don't like you.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.710
What's not to like?

32:04.257 --> 32:06.301
- Trixie.
- All right, easy, Decker.

32:06.509 --> 32:07.802
Easy.

32:08.011 --> 32:10.013
Mommy, can we
go home now?

32:10.221 --> 32:12.307
- Yes, Monkey.
- We can.

32:12.515 --> 32:15.018
Glad to see you came alone.

32:15.226 --> 32:17.687
Now toss the gun.

32:25.695 --> 32:26.905
Now the other one.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.580
There. You happy?

32:35.788 --> 32:37.624
Yeah, once I get
my money, sure.

32:37.832 --> 32:39.542
So, where is it?

32:39.751 --> 32:41.628
Not without Trixie.

32:41.836 --> 32:44.380
- Oh, come on, Decker...
- Malcolm, that's the deal.

32:49.218 --> 32:50.261
Go on.

32:54.098 --> 32:54.891
Hi.

32:56.059 --> 32:57.310
Okay, listen to me.

32:57.518 --> 32:59.187
We're gonna play a game,
all right?

32:59.395 --> 33:01.981
I need you to hide
until I can come find you.

33:02.190 --> 33:03.608
Mommy, I don't
want to play a game.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.360
I know you don't, baby.

33:05.568 --> 33:08.738
But I need you to go hide
really, really well, okay?

33:09.906 --> 33:11.741
Go.

33:11.950 --> 33:14.452
Kids, huh?

33:22.585 --> 33:24.212
It's there.
It's-it's all there.

33:24.420 --> 33:25.421
It's in the bag.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.632
Yeah. I believe you.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.844
You don't need to do this,
Malcolm.

33:32.053 --> 33:35.223
I know, but I was gonna
shoot you at Palmetto,

33:35.431 --> 33:38.893
and now I feel like I've been
given a second chance here,

33:39.102 --> 33:41.938
so I'm sure as hell
not gonna waste it.

33:52.407 --> 33:54.575
Is this really what you did

33:54.784 --> 33:57.537
with your second chance?

33:57.745 --> 33:58.997
Deary me, Malcolm.
Pathetic.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.289
Hey, Lucifer.

34:00.498 --> 34:02.750
Hey, buddy.
Long time no frame.

34:02.959 --> 34:05.294
Though that didn't
stick too well, did it?

34:05.503 --> 34:07.755
Guess I need to find
a more permanent solution.

34:07.964 --> 34:10.550
Give me the gun, Malcolm.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.302
Why? Not afraid of you.

34:13.511 --> 34:14.887
All you're doing
is getting yourself killed.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.514
And for what?

34:16.723 --> 34:18.224
To buy your precious
detective some more time?

34:18.433 --> 34:20.226
No.

34:20.435 --> 34:21.978
No, I want
to ask you a question.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.938
Oh.

34:25.898 --> 34:29.068
What do you desire, Malcolm?

34:31.987 --> 34:33.739
Lucifer, what are you doing?

34:33.947 --> 34:36.826
What do you yearn for in that...

34:37.034 --> 34:38.619
rotten soul of yours?

34:40.246 --> 34:41.664
I...

34:41.873 --> 34:43.666
You've been given
a second chance, Malcolm.

34:43.875 --> 34:45.168
Is killing Detective Decker

34:45.376 --> 34:46.710
really what you want
to do with it?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.005
I don't.

34:50.214 --> 34:52.007
No, of course you don't.

34:52.216 --> 34:54.052
You want to live,
don't you?

34:56.387 --> 34:57.513
I do.

34:59.182 --> 35:01.142
More than almost anything.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.102
Almost?

35:16.532 --> 35:17.825
There's one more thing.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.300
You feel that?

35:37.095 --> 35:38.763
That's what it's like
to die, my man.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.640
I know, 'cause I've done it.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.686
And what I want,
more than anything...

35:47.939 --> 35:51.400
...is for you to feel that pain.

35:51.609 --> 35:52.777
To go through what I did.

35:54.779 --> 35:57.573
Because we both know
where you're going to.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.331
Bet you never expected

36:05.540 --> 36:06.707
to miss this thing so soon.

36:08.501 --> 36:09.627
Yeah.

36:09.836 --> 36:11.420
Don't worry.

36:11.629 --> 36:13.339
You won't be going alone.

36:13.548 --> 36:16.801
I'll be sending Decker along
right behind you.

36:19.345 --> 36:20.221
Oh, Chloe...

36:22.849 --> 36:24.684
Oh, Decker...

36:37.029 --> 36:39.031
Here, Chloe, Chloe, Chloe.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.700
<i>I don't know if this is all</i>

36:40.908 --> 36:42.743
part of the plan.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.830
Or if You can even hear me.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.211
But if You're up there...

36:52.420 --> 36:54.088
Dad...

36:55.464 --> 36:58.634
I need a favor.

37:02.388 --> 37:03.723
<i>I'll be the son</i>

37:03.931 --> 37:06.017
<i>You always wanted me to be.</i>

37:08.352 --> 37:10.563
I'll do as You ask.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.857
Go where You want me to.

37:13.065 --> 37:14.150
I...

37:16.027 --> 37:18.738
In exchange,

37:18.946 --> 37:23.409
all I ask is...

37:23.618 --> 37:26.537
is that you protect Chloe.

37:51.771 --> 37:53.773
Home, sweet home.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.117
Bloody ash.

38:08.704 --> 38:10.581
That can't be right.

38:25.263 --> 38:26.514
It's open.

38:34.105 --> 38:36.023
This isn't possible.

39:08.848 --> 39:10.349
Hello, Malkie.

39:29.327 --> 39:30.369
It doesn't matter.

39:32.246 --> 39:33.372
I've got your coin.

39:33.581 --> 39:34.874
Oh.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.917
I'll be back.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.176
You're looking for this?

39:45.384 --> 39:46.886
How...?

39:47.094 --> 39:48.929
I know a guy.

39:50.723 --> 39:52.933
Apparently,
He wants me back here.

40:05.237 --> 40:08.240
Sorry, pal.

40:09.867 --> 40:11.285
One use only.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.593
Trixie!

40:27.802 --> 40:30.096
Come out, honey!

40:30.304 --> 40:31.764
Mommy, is it over?

40:31.972 --> 40:33.849
Yeah, baby, it's over.
Come here.

40:35.893 --> 40:37.269
Hi.

40:37.478 --> 40:41.023
Oh, I'm so happy
you're okay.

40:41.232 --> 40:43.067
Excuse me if I don't join
the group hug.

40:47.947 --> 40:49.365
I thought he killed you.

40:49.573 --> 40:50.449
Oh, he did.

40:50.658 --> 40:51.492
Yes.

40:53.369 --> 40:55.037
I got better.

40:55.246 --> 40:57.289
Hmm.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.291
You promised
you'd let me go alone.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.835
True.

41:01.043 --> 41:02.753
But I didn't say anything
about following.

41:05.297 --> 41:06.590
What's wrong?

41:09.677 --> 41:10.719
Isn't it past her bedtime?

41:16.392 --> 41:18.394
Hmm?

41:34.076 --> 41:35.828
Ah!

41:36.036 --> 41:37.872
Sleeping on the job?

41:39.373 --> 41:40.624
Luci, we still have
to find Malcolm...

41:40.833 --> 41:42.376
Malcolm, yes.

41:42.585 --> 41:43.919
That's dealt with.
It's old news, really.

41:52.344 --> 41:53.637
Where's Maze?

41:53.846 --> 41:55.514
Well, I was gonna ask you
the same question.

41:55.723 --> 41:57.433
Perhaps your snoring
drove her away.

42:03.481 --> 42:04.690
I spoke to Dad.

42:04.899 --> 42:06.525
Excuse me?

42:06.734 --> 42:09.904
Yeah. I offered Him my services
in exchange f...

42:10.112 --> 42:12.865
Well, that doesn't
really matter.

42:13.073 --> 42:14.617
He accepted.

42:17.828 --> 42:19.163
He replied to you.

42:19.371 --> 42:20.372
Mmm.

42:20.581 --> 42:22.208
Well, not in words.

42:22.416 --> 42:23.542
But His message was clear.

42:23.751 --> 42:25.294
And what does Father want?

42:26.921 --> 42:28.255
Someone's escaped from Hell.

42:30.466 --> 42:32.384
Must've seen
a window of opportunity

42:32.593 --> 42:34.386
whilst you were incapacitated.

42:34.595 --> 42:35.846
I think He wants
me to bring

42:36.055 --> 42:37.223
our jailbird back.

42:37.431 --> 42:38.974
That's it?

42:39.183 --> 42:40.726
Well, it shouldn't be too hard

42:40.935 --> 42:42.811
to track down
a single errant soul.

42:50.361 --> 42:51.237
You're afraid.

42:53.531 --> 42:55.074
Mmm.

42:55.241 --> 42:56.534
Damn right I am.

42:56.742 --> 42:58.869
Right, but you're never afraid.

42:59.078 --> 43:00.913
Who could possibly
scare you, brother?

43:04.792 --> 43:06.669
Lucifer...

43:06.877 --> 43:09.588
Who escaped Hell?

43:14.260 --> 43:15.302
Mum.
