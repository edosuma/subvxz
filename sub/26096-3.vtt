Okay. So earlier today,
I kinda, sorta, decided to...

03:14.694 --> 03:17.071
Well, after all that Dreamscape business,

03:17.155 --> 03:19.699
I... I told Erika
about my secret identity.

That puts us at risk too.

like in my dream. But instead she... Um...

Dr. C coded this as a top priority.

[device hisses]

16:30.322 --> 16:31.240
[gasps]

16:32.241 --> 16:33.951
[yells in agony]

16:36.245 --> 16:37.746
[creaking]

16:42.501 --> 16:43.919
[roars]

16:45.295 --> 16:49.967
Jonathan Rook is that creature?
Fascinating.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.970
Turning you in was going to be
worth a lot to me.

16:53.595 --> 16:58.976
This is going to be worth
so much more.

16:59.059 --> 17:03.772
[Jake]<i> Blindstrike,</i>
<i>this is the ghost of Stretch.</i>

17:03.856 --> 17:05.315
<i>[wails]</i>

17:05.399 --> 17:06.275
[laughs]

17:06.358 --> 17:09.528
<i>-Just kidding. Totally alive here.</i>
-What are you doing out here?

17:09.611 --> 17:11.613
<i>When you disappeared on us,</i>
<i>we were worried.</i>

17:11.697 --> 17:13.866
<i>It's what a team does.</i>
<i>And good thing we did.</i>

17:13.949 --> 17:16.452
<i>-This guy's nuts.</i>
<i>-He dropped a house on us.</i>

17:16.535 --> 17:18.245
<i>Hold tight while we work on a rescue plan.</i>

17:25.502 --> 17:29.757
<i>-Illegal access. Self-destruct initiated.</i>
-Denied?

17:29.840 --> 17:32.843
You won't keep me out of this system.
[gasps]

17:32.926 --> 17:33.927
Hi.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.637
[grunts]

17:37.014 --> 17:38.932
I saw you three get flattened.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.769
My name's Stretch. I can do flattened.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.521
I dare say,
four against one isn't sporting.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.024
Yet I'll see if I can manage.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.693
[suit powers up]

17:50.527 --> 17:51.570
[clicking]

17:56.700 --> 17:59.995
You get bigger? I invented get bigger.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.206
[Computer]<i> Sixty seconds to self-destruct.</i>

18:12.091 --> 18:13.842
[grunts]
Whoa!

18:13.926 --> 18:15.302
[they grunt]

18:18.806 --> 18:22.226
<i>-Thirty seconds to self-destruct.</i>
-This is super fun and all, not really,

18:22.309 --> 18:24.394
but we need to quit fighting and run!

18:25.854 --> 18:27.064
A capital idea.

18:27.147 --> 18:31.568
I look forward to a rematch,
assuming you survive. Cheerio.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.074
-Blindstrike, come on!
<i>-Fifteen seconds to self-destruct.</i>

18:37.157 --> 18:39.785
No. This lab has the proof we need.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.912
Footage that shows
Rook is Stretch Monster.

18:41.995 --> 18:42.955
[computer beeps]

18:43.038 --> 18:44.748
We don't have time.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.000
-I'm not leaving without it.
<i>-Ten, nine, eight...</i>

18:47.084 --> 18:49.378
-Blindstrike, you're not in this alone.
-...seven,<i> six...</i>

18:49.461 --> 18:52.214
We all wanna stop Rook,
but we need to be alive to do it.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.217
<i>...three, two, one.</i>

18:55.300 --> 18:57.136
[explosion]

19:03.183 --> 19:06.520
So this wasn't just about visiting
an old vacation home, was it?

19:06.603 --> 19:10.107
My parents created Flexarium
with Dr. C and Rook.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.652
They were the other scientists
on the plane with Dr. C.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.445
I was just a kid,

19:15.529 --> 19:17.781
but I still managed to figure out
Rook was responsible

19:17.865 --> 19:19.783
for their plane going down.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.953
But everyone assumed Dr. C died too.
Even Rook.

19:23.036 --> 19:26.540
Yeah. But I found enough clues
to figure out she was still alive.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.876
I tracked her down
and insisted she train me.

19:28.959 --> 19:33.380
So, someday, I could get my revenge,
expose what Rook did to my parents

19:33.463 --> 19:35.090
and take him down.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.384
Back when we were still working
for Rook,

19:37.467 --> 19:39.928
you tried to steal the flight recorder
of the plane.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.890
You were searching for proof
that Rook sabotaged it.

19:42.973 --> 19:47.227
While fighting Dr. Dreamscape,
my dream was a forgotten memory.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.230
My parents' beach house
from when I was a kid.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.108
I'm just glad you're okay.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.616
We should get back to HQ
and report all of this to Dr. C.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.868
We need to take your friend too.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.871
Now that she knows all about this,
Dr. C will wanna talk to her.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.122
Friend?

20:07.206 --> 20:11.126
Wait, wait. You were obviously followed
here all the way from the city

20:11.210 --> 20:14.296
by an untrained high schooler,
and didn't even notice?

20:14.379 --> 20:17.883
Wow. We really need to work
on your security training.

20:17.966 --> 20:18.967
Um...

20:19.051 --> 20:21.720
Hey, guys. Cool outfits.

20:21.803 --> 20:26.642
-Erika! What the absolute... What?
-How much did you see?

20:26.725 --> 20:30.646
Nothing, nothing at all.
Why, why? Did something happen?

20:30.729 --> 20:35.192
-She saw everything.
-Wait, including the footage of Rook?

20:35.275 --> 20:38.237
Yeah, that explained a lot actually.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.490
When you first told me,
I was pretty shocked.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.284
But I found it hard to believe
you could really be bad.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.912
So I followed you guys
from the train station

20:46.995 --> 20:49.498
after overhearing
your conversation at school.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.335
Wow, you're right.
We really need to work on that training.

20:53.418 --> 20:57.506
I had to see for myself
what the truth was, and I did.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.425
Trust me,
I understand why you had reservations.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.928
No one mistrusted the Flex Fighters
more than me.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.681
But now, I'm glad to call them teammates.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.849
I can see why.

21:09.977 --> 21:14.064
And since I failed to retrieve the target,
I'll be returning the retainer fee.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.066
I'd rather have the target.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.985
And yet you do not.

21:18.068 --> 21:22.823
So a refund is the proper thing to do,
but I'm sure I'll be seeing you again.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.575
In fact, I guarantee it.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.121
[growls gently]
